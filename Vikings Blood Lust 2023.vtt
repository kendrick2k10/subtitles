(dramatic music)

31
00:02:17.738 --> 00:02:20.708
- You've got the face of a
man who wishes for death.

32
00:02:24.778 --> 00:02:25.946
- I just want peace.

33
00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:31.752
- You know too well. a life of
peace can be so very boring.

34
00:02:33.854 --> 00:02:35.756
You live for battle.

35
00:02:35.756 --> 00:02:38.526
There's a raging demon
inside you. I've seen it.

36
00:02:38.526 --> 00:02:40.928
- That was a long time ago.

37
00:02:40.928 --> 00:02:44.265
- But. at the same time. there's
also a coward inside you.

38
00:02:44.265 --> 00:02:45.499
I've seen that as well.

39
00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:49.970
Are you in pain?

40
00:02:51.205 --> 00:02:53.741
- Only from the sound
of your bloody voice.

41
00:02:55.876 --> 00:02:56.644
End this.

42
00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:59.613
I do not fear death.

43
00:03:01.148 --> 00:03:02.049
- Not your own.

44
00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.022
But when a man has a family.
he's never truly free.

45
00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:13.193
- This is between you and I.

46
00:03:14.895 --> 00:03:19.967
- Imagine. you and your boy
lying bound. bleeding. watching.

47
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:22.636
while I have my fun
with your dear wife?

48
00:03:22.636 --> 00:03:24.605
- You dare threaten them.

49
00:03:24.605 --> 00:03:28.742
- A bit of spirit from
noble. diplomatic Ander.

50
00:03:28.742 --> 00:03:32.580
You come to me.
looking for a truce.

51
00:03:34.248 --> 00:03:38.252
Compromise does not exist here.

52
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.391
- I believe there is good
in everything. even you.

53
00:03:43.391 --> 00:03:46.159
- So. kind of how there's evil.

54
00:03:47.094 --> 00:03:48.829
even in holy-than-thou Ander.

55
00:03:50.998 --> 00:03:53.166
- That's for the gods to decide.

56
00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:58.238
- There is no evil.
no good. only nature.

57
00:03:59.473 --> 00:04:02.610
the animal spirits and
the animals. like us.

58
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.244
- Must you bloody talk so much?

59
00:04:05.613 --> 00:04:07.114
- There.

60
00:04:07.114 --> 00:04:08.582
that's what I'm looking for.

61
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.253
- Please. Amleth. we
could still have peace.

62
00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:17.124
- I don't want
your bloody peace.

63
00:04:17.124 --> 00:04:20.227
(both moaning)

64
00:04:20.227 --> 00:04:23.063
(dramatic music)

65
00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:26.934
(both moaning)

66
00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:30.838
(dramatic music)

67
00:05:01.835 --> 00:05:03.371
Agree to the games. Ander.

68
00:05:03.371 --> 00:05:05.373
and we can just leave this
blood lust for the circle.

69
00:05:05.373 --> 00:05:07.307
It's simple.
- No.

70
00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:08.876
- The games. Ander.

71
00:05:08.876 --> 00:05:12.646
- There's nothing sporting
about your games. Amleth.

72
00:05:13.547 --> 00:05:14.482
Last warning.

73
00:05:14.482 --> 00:05:16.617
I don't want to use this.

74
00:05:16.617 --> 00:05:19.753
- No. you want a better
tomorrow. don't you?

75
00:05:19.753 --> 00:05:21.321
- A better today.

76
00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:24.558
(dramatic music)

77
00:05:24.558 --> 00:05:28.195
- If you want your peace.
then let the games commence.

78
00:05:29.763 --> 00:05:33.401
- There'll be no one
left to enjoy the peace.

79
00:05:34.368 --> 00:05:35.669
Last chance.

80
00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.671
let my family be.

81
00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:40.340
- No. this is your last chance.

82
00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:44.211
Use that on me now

83
00:05:44.211 --> 00:05:46.947
or I'll take it off you
and gut you with it.

84
00:05:46.947 --> 00:05:51.018
And then. who to violate first.

85
00:05:51.018 --> 00:05:54.354
your pretty daughter
or your pretty son?

86
00:05:55.288 --> 00:05:56.624
- I warned you.

87
00:05:58.526 --> 00:06:00.861
- Do what you feel you must.

88
00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:03.764
(dramatic music)

89
00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:11.204
(gasping)

90
00:06:14.742 --> 00:06:17.645

91
00:06:27.588 --> 00:06:31.324
(sings in foreign language)

92
00:06:32.426 --> 00:06:35.328
(dramatic music)

93
00:06:37.698 --> 00:06:41.435
(sings in foreign language)

94
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.777
(birds chirping)

95
00:06:53.914 --> 00:06:56.650
(both moaning)

96
00:06:58.218 --> 00:07:01.622
- Come Bodil. it's
already battle.

97
00:07:01.622 --> 00:07:04.357
(both moaning)

98
00:07:08.862 --> 00:07:11.665
Are you sure this one
squirted from Father's loins?

99
00:07:11.665 --> 00:07:14.635
(laughing)

100
00:07:14.635 --> 00:07:16.870
Something you never
told us. Mother?

101
00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:19.239
- Your brother's right.

102
00:07:19.239 --> 00:07:21.642
How would you expect
to win a real battle?

103
00:07:24.044 --> 00:07:25.579
Is this how my youngest dies?

104
00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:29.650
Is it?

105
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:32.319
(both moaning)

106
00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:34.187
(Finnr moaning)

107
00:07:34.187 --> 00:07:36.624
Improvisation. wonderful.

108
00:07:36.624 --> 00:07:39.527
(Estrid laughing)

109
00:07:41.361 --> 00:07:44.264
(birds chirping)

110
00:07:47.768 --> 00:07:49.803
- We are both our
father's sons. Finnr.

111
00:07:51.138 --> 00:07:54.141
- If that's so. why do I
thrash you around so easily?

112
00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:56.710
- Didn't I just win?

113
00:07:57.978 --> 00:07:59.880
- [Finnr] No.

114
00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:00.681
Mother.

115
00:08:00.681 --> 00:08:01.549
- Silence. both of you.

116
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:06.386
(dramatic music)

117
00:08:06.386 --> 00:08:09.189
Are our competitors
preparing for the games?

118
00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:11.925
I can't wait to
meet Ander's family.

119
00:08:13.727 --> 00:08:15.262
- I have grave news. My Lady.

120
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:17.898
- What news?

121
00:08:17.898 --> 00:08:18.932
(dramatic music)

122
00:08:18.932 --> 00:08:21.201
(birds chirping)

123
00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:22.102
- Speak.

124
00:08:23.036 --> 00:08:24.137
Where's my husband?

125
00:08:25.172 --> 00:08:26.073
- There was a.

126
00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:30.277
Forgive me.

127
00:08:30.277 --> 00:08:32.913
- Why aren't I hearing
this through Amleth's lips?

128
00:08:32.913 --> 00:08:34.848
- That's not possible.

129
00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:36.717
(dramatic music)

130
00:08:36.717 --> 00:08:38.451
- Get to the point.

131
00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:41.088
(dramatic music)

132
00:08:41.088 --> 00:08:42.489
And once more.

133
00:08:43.456 --> 00:08:46.293
where is my husband?

134
00:08:47.227 --> 00:08:50.130
(dramatic music)

135
00:09:00.307 --> 00:09:02.375
- Are you not worried. Uncle?

136
00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:03.711
- I worry for the bloody idiot

137
00:09:03.711 --> 00:09:06.013
that pushes your father too far.

138
00:09:06.013 --> 00:09:09.149
About as clever as sticking
your head under a horse's tail.

139
00:09:09.149 --> 00:09:10.818
- Is that you complimenting him?

140
00:09:18.025 --> 00:09:18.926
Uncle.

141
00:09:20.027 --> 00:09:21.494
Father refused to
tell me of the games

142
00:09:21.494 --> 00:09:23.163
these Berserkers participate in.

143
00:09:25.098 --> 00:09:27.601
- You flatter them. calling
them Berserkers. Gro.

144
00:09:28.736 --> 00:09:31.872
Perhaps once they were. but now.

145
00:09:31.872 --> 00:09:33.674
these people are something else.

146
00:09:36.209 --> 00:09:39.913
This Amleth creature. he
wants to force this family

147
00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:42.249
into his games. including
your mother and sister.

148
00:09:42.249 --> 00:09:44.251
- And what do the games involve?

149
00:09:45.686 --> 00:09:47.187
- Human cock fighting.

150
00:09:47.187 --> 00:09:51.524
And. I don't mean humans
fighting with their cocks.

151
00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:52.559
- That is why Father

152
00:09:52.559 --> 00:09:55.128
was so very.
- Yes.

153
00:09:55.128 --> 00:09:56.930
he was so very.

154
00:09:58.065 --> 00:09:59.900
- Have you ever seen
the games in action?

155
00:10:04.137 --> 00:10:07.607
- Your father and
I and this savage.

156
00:10:08.976 --> 00:10:13.714
our troops fought together.
side-by-side. during the wars.

157
00:10:14.748 --> 00:10:16.449
- And then why
does he hate us so?

158
00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:17.785
- It's your father he hates.

159
00:10:17.785 --> 00:10:19.653
us by extension. we're a bonus.

160
00:10:19.653 --> 00:10:21.221
- [Gro] But why?

161
00:10:21.221 --> 00:10:22.489
- That's a question
for your father.

162
00:10:22.489 --> 00:10:23.924
- But Uncle. there must be.

163
00:10:23.924 --> 00:10:24.958
- Enough. boy.

164
00:10:26.727 --> 00:10:29.863
Or I'll hit you with this.
right into the trees.

165
00:10:32.165 --> 00:10:33.066
- Point taken.

166
00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:35.836
- Or rather. blunt edge taken.

167
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.375
- That thing is a beauty.

168
00:10:43.811 --> 00:10:45.345
- How dare you.

169
00:10:45.345 --> 00:10:48.348
Gudrind is a she. not a thing.

170
00:10:49.249 --> 00:10:50.050
- A she?

171
00:10:51.919 --> 00:10:55.422
- Finely crafted objects
like this have a soul.

172
00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.193
I didn't choose her. she
found me during the war.

173
00:11:00.193 --> 00:11:01.194
- Are they all female?

174
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:05.699
- How does your object
feel within your hand?

175
00:11:09.036 --> 00:11:09.903
- Good.

176
00:11:09.903 --> 00:11:10.938
- Then it's female.

177
00:11:14.274 --> 00:11:15.575
- Her name will be Assy.

178
00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:17.577
- Assy?

179
00:11:18.545 --> 00:11:19.780
Why?

180
00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.049
- Because she feels like
a goddess in my hands.

181
00:11:22.049 --> 00:11:25.452
- You want me to leave
you alone with her?

182
00:11:25.452 --> 00:11:27.554
- Ah. as always. you
are disgusting. Uncle.

183
00:11:27.554 --> 00:11:28.421
- That's me.

184
00:11:32.826 --> 00:11:35.996
If we believe that a
gentle soul resides

185
00:11:35.996 --> 00:11:39.166
within these weapons. then
we don't use them lightly.

186
00:11:40.768 --> 00:11:42.369
Not for vengeance.

187
00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:43.536
certainly not for sport.

188
00:11:44.637 --> 00:11:45.939
We use them for defense.

189
00:11:45.939 --> 00:11:47.007
(twigs breaking)

190
00:11:47.007 --> 00:11:48.041
Speaking of which.

191
00:11:49.276 --> 00:11:50.310
Show yourself.

192
00:11:51.478 --> 00:11:54.782
We mean you no harm.
unless you mean us harm.

193
00:11:54.782 --> 00:11:56.917
in which case. piss off.

194
00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.090
(birds chirping)

195
00:12:08.628 --> 00:12:09.662
Went well. did it?

196
00:12:12.132 --> 00:12:15.035
(birds chirping)

197
00:12:16.436 --> 00:12:19.439
(Estrid screaming)

198
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.341
- [Bodil] Mother.

199
00:12:21.341 --> 00:12:24.077
(Estrid crying)

200
00:12:27.414 --> 00:12:30.517
- He was not meant to
die by a soft-hand.

201
00:12:30.517 --> 00:12:32.652
All he wanted was his games.

202
00:12:32.652 --> 00:12:34.922
- Ander is a fierce warrior.

203
00:12:34.922 --> 00:12:36.123
- No.

204
00:12:36.123 --> 00:12:37.858
- And father died a
worthy death in battle.

205
00:12:37.858 --> 00:12:38.758
It's.
- No.

206
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.594
- It was the death he.
- No.

207
00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:45.632
Your father's watching now.

208
00:12:46.733 --> 00:12:48.869
through the eyes of
the wolves. the bears.

209
00:12:48.869 --> 00:12:50.137
the birds from above.

210
00:12:52.906 --> 00:12:54.674
He expects his games.

211
00:12:56.376 --> 00:13:00.180
Get Finnr. he's the
man of the clan now.

212
00:13:01.514 --> 00:13:02.415
Go.

213
00:13:02.415 --> 00:13:03.316
- Aye. Mother.

214
00:13:05.652 --> 00:13:09.256
(dramatic music)

215
00:13:09.256 --> 00:13:12.225
(Estrid crying)

216
00:13:12.225 --> 00:13:13.393
- Talked with Amleth.

217
00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:18.698
Seems he's not
one for reasoning.

218
00:13:18.698 --> 00:13:19.900
What a total shock.

219
00:13:21.234 --> 00:13:23.670
- Spare your sarcasm. Brother.

220
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:25.738
- I can't. it's a part of me.

221
00:13:25.738 --> 00:13:27.640
- The games. Father.

222
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.577
If Amleth is dead. then surely
it is no longer a problem.

223
00:13:31.444 --> 00:13:32.712
- What did you tell him?

224
00:13:33.513 --> 00:13:34.414
- Me?

225
00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:38.685
- Oh. thank Oden. your back.

226
00:13:39.552 --> 00:13:40.420
- Ah.

227
00:13:41.889 --> 00:13:44.858
- He's injured and all you
can think is to give him wine?

228
00:13:44.858 --> 00:13:46.459
- Seemed most urgent.

229
00:13:46.459 --> 00:13:48.061
- Father.

230
00:13:48.061 --> 00:13:49.629
you were gone so
long. I was worried.

231
00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:51.231
- (Ander groaning)

232
00:13:51.231 --> 00:13:52.465
- You all right. Father?

233
00:13:52.465 --> 00:13:54.101
- Oh. you should
see the other guy.

234
00:13:55.035 --> 00:13:55.835
- What happened?

235
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:58.906
- We need to leave.

236
00:14:00.908 --> 00:14:02.175
- Leave?

237
00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:03.643
- You killed him. didn't you?

238
00:14:03.643 --> 00:14:05.913
- So much for your
life of peace.

239
00:14:05.913 --> 00:14:07.347
- I had to.

240
00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:11.284
Or. I can't even say out loud

241
00:14:11.284 --> 00:14:12.986
what he would've
done to you all.

242
00:14:14.621 --> 00:14:15.855
- I don't understand.

243
00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:17.925
Father. who is this
man that you speak of?

244
00:14:19.059 --> 00:14:19.960
- Amleth.

245
00:14:20.894 --> 00:14:23.630
He was a man I knew in the wars.

246
00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:27.667
an animal worshiper.
now leader of a tribe.

247
00:14:28.735 --> 00:14:30.237
A cult. really.

248
00:14:32.005 --> 00:14:35.842
Who want nothing more
than blood by the gallon.

249
00:14:35.842 --> 00:14:37.344
(birds chirping)

250
00:14:37.344 --> 00:14:40.247
I thought I heard the last
of him but I was wrong.

251
00:14:41.848 --> 00:14:44.084
Now. he found me.

252
00:14:44.952 --> 00:14:46.186
He found us.

253
00:14:47.921 --> 00:14:49.056
- But. now he's dead.

254
00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:52.960
And those swines no
longer have a leader.

255
00:14:54.594 --> 00:14:58.765
- Cut off the snake's
head. another grows back.

256
00:14:58.765 --> 00:15:00.600
- You cut off his head?

257
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.435
- Shut up. Gunnar.

258
00:15:02.435 --> 00:15:04.737
- Amleth had sons.

259
00:15:04.737 --> 00:15:08.241
two by blood. many
more by blood oath.

260
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:12.345
I was naive this morning.

261
00:15:14.214 --> 00:15:17.350
Now I know this
feud will never end.

262
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:18.918
- What are you saying. Father?

263
00:15:19.719 --> 00:15:21.388
- We need to travel West.

264
00:15:21.388 --> 00:15:22.455
- No.
- Brother.

265
00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:26.659
- We cannot let these animals
drive us from our home.

266
00:15:26.659 --> 00:15:27.860
To hell with them.

267
00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:28.996
- Let's fight back.

268
00:15:30.363 --> 00:15:34.001
- That would be a sheep
eating from a fox's hand.

269
00:15:34.001 --> 00:15:35.402
- Yeah. he means dangerous.

270
00:15:37.137 --> 00:15:41.608
- But Father. with you and
Uncle. surely we can take them.

271
00:15:42.642 --> 00:15:44.444
And besides. loveless
souls like that.

272
00:15:44.444 --> 00:15:47.014
perhaps they won't
even come for us.

273
00:15:47.014 --> 00:15:48.848
- There's at least
a dozen of them.

274
00:15:50.617 --> 00:15:51.784
We can't risk it.

275
00:15:54.321 --> 00:15:59.392
And I can't live knowing
you're all in danger.

276
00:15:59.926 --> 00:16:00.994
(birds chirping)

277
00:16:00.994 --> 00:16:02.462
- Father's right.

278
00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:04.764
We can't just wait here hoping
nothing will ever happen.

279
00:16:04.764 --> 00:16:07.000
being forever on edge.

280
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.636
I've never met these
heathens and I never wish to.

281
00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:12.639
A woman should
never have to fight.

282
00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.342
- We should always
be prepared to.

283
00:16:19.146 --> 00:16:23.516
We were married here. our
children were born here.

284
00:16:24.384 --> 00:16:26.019
- Do you want them to die here?

285
00:16:27.154 --> 00:16:30.057
- And the gods speak of
people who are immortal.

286
00:16:30.057 --> 00:16:31.724
And what if we're those people?

287
00:16:32.792 --> 00:16:34.561
- I'm sure the gods
would also call

288
00:16:34.561 --> 00:16:37.564
anyone waiting around to
find out. a bloody fool.

289
00:16:38.398 --> 00:16:39.599
(birds chirping)

290
00:16:39.599 --> 00:16:42.202
- They could be
here at any moment.

291
00:16:42.202 --> 00:16:43.703
We need to leave.

292
00:16:43.703 --> 00:16:44.604
- We can't.

293
00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:47.307
- Oh. silly brother.

294
00:16:47.307 --> 00:16:48.375
- I can't.

295
00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.246
- Freda's body may rest here.

296
00:16:54.747 --> 00:16:58.085
but her soul. she goes
wherever you travel.

297
00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:04.391
Come.

298
00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:07.160
we must prepare to leave.

299
00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.697
(gentle music)

300
00:17:11.598 --> 00:17:14.401
(fire crackling)

301
00:17:14.401 --> 00:17:15.868
- A great man has fallen.

302
00:17:18.305 --> 00:17:21.741
No. has been taken.

303
00:17:21.741 --> 00:17:24.177
(gentle music)

304
00:17:24.177 --> 00:17:28.348
His only crime. the
pursuit of good sport.

305
00:17:30.683 --> 00:17:32.252
It was my father's only dream.

306
00:17:33.353 --> 00:17:34.187
(gentle music)

307
00:17:34.187 --> 00:17:35.688
(fire crackling)

308
00:17:35.688 --> 00:17:38.625
For the great bearer to
call down a rain of blood

309
00:17:39.926 --> 00:17:43.930
from the wounds gouged
by the Joseph families.

310
00:17:44.831 --> 00:17:46.099
in the great savage war.

311
00:17:46.933 --> 00:17:47.767
(fire crackling)

312
00:17:47.767 --> 00:17:48.935
(gentle music)

313
00:17:48.935 --> 00:17:49.936
A blood storm.

314
00:17:51.037 --> 00:17:54.207
paling anything
that false god Thor

315
00:17:54.207 --> 00:17:56.443
could only hope to conjure.

316
00:17:56.443 --> 00:17:57.910
In remembrance of my father.

317
00:17:59.279 --> 00:18:02.182
I call this storm to fall
on the pious hypocrite.

318
00:18:03.183 --> 00:18:06.453
the coward. known as Ander.

319
00:18:06.453 --> 00:18:07.820
(fire crackling)

320
00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:08.655
(gentle music)

321
00:18:08.655 --> 00:18:09.922
- Your father was a god.

322
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:12.292
A wolf in man's form.

323
00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:15.895
(gentle music)

324
00:18:15.895 --> 00:18:18.631
(fire crackling)

325
00:18:18.631 --> 00:18:19.599
- Bring the storm.

326
00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:22.835
- Yes. thank you my sons.

327
00:18:22.835 --> 00:18:24.471
(gentle music)

328
00:18:24.471 --> 00:18:26.373
May the heathen Ander

329
00:18:26.373 --> 00:18:29.108
be soaked in the blood
of his own family.

330
00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:31.678
And with that.

331
00:18:31.678 --> 00:18:33.446
the gift of
immortality for us all.

332
00:18:34.814 --> 00:18:39.219
To the fallen. placed
forever by my father's side.

333
00:18:39.219 --> 00:18:40.052
(dramatic music)

334
00:18:40.052 --> 00:18:41.288
(fire crackling)

335
00:18:41.288 --> 00:18:43.890
- I look to you as if
you were Amleth himself.

336
00:18:45.725 --> 00:18:47.026
(dramatic music)

337
00:18:47.026 --> 00:18:49.862
(fire crackling)

338
00:18:49.862 --> 00:18:51.464
- When he found the bastard.

339
00:18:52.899 --> 00:18:54.567
the liar Ander.

340
00:18:55.735 --> 00:18:58.638
this year's games
was an opportunity

341
00:18:58.638 --> 00:19:03.243
for the great beast god to
see their creation in action.

342
00:19:05.111 --> 00:19:07.146
to see what we are
truly capable of.

343
00:19:08.248 --> 00:19:10.683
(dramatic music)

344
00:19:10.683 --> 00:19:15.555
Anything less than the
bastard Ander. will deny us.

345
00:19:16.589 --> 00:19:19.492
There is nothing
short of blasphemous.

346
00:19:22.028 --> 00:19:23.263
We shall avenge him.

347
00:19:25.432 --> 00:19:28.301
And have much fun
in the process.

348
00:19:28.301 --> 00:19:29.802
(dramatic music)

349
00:19:29.802 --> 00:19:33.240
(fire crackling)

350
00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.975
(gentle music)

351
00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:41.180
- I know you can hear me.

352
00:19:44.083 --> 00:19:45.385
I must protect them.

353
00:19:49.622 --> 00:19:51.123
I've never let your side.

354
00:19:52.058 --> 00:19:53.059
even in your death.

355
00:19:54.827 --> 00:19:56.329
But they've kept me together.

356
00:19:58.531 --> 00:20:02.435
even when I was determined
to destroy myself.

357
00:20:05.305 --> 00:20:06.205
Remember that?

358
00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:11.478
What I was like after
you were. taken.

359
00:20:12.345 --> 00:20:15.081
(gentle music)

360
00:20:16.048 --> 00:20:19.719
They're my family. your family.

361
00:20:25.625 --> 00:20:27.527
I don't ask for
your forgiveness.

362
00:20:27.527 --> 00:20:29.028
because I know you'd just say

363
00:20:31.931 --> 00:20:33.600
that there's nothing to forgive.

364
00:20:35.968 --> 00:20:38.571
Besides. this isn't you.

365
00:20:39.672 --> 00:20:42.309
(gentle music)

366
00:20:45.978 --> 00:20:46.813
You're here.

367
00:20:48.648 --> 00:20:51.284
(gentle music)

368
00:21:01.794 --> 00:21:05.732
Unless you're here
to cook supper.

369
00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:09.569
I suggest you piss off on the
whore that carried you here.

370
00:21:12.472 --> 00:21:13.373
- Hello. friend.

371
00:21:16.443 --> 00:21:18.978
Consider me a final
friendly warning.

372
00:21:18.978 --> 00:21:23.115
Get Ander. get the family.
and leave with me now.

373
00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:24.016
It'll be fun.

374
00:21:25.284 --> 00:21:27.186
- I don't like fun.

375
00:21:27.186 --> 00:21:28.721
It's boring.

376
00:21:28.721 --> 00:21:29.622
Trot on.

377
00:21:31.491 --> 00:21:32.959
- Know then. there
are others coming

378
00:21:32.959 --> 00:21:34.894
who will not be so polite.

379
00:21:34.894 --> 00:21:38.297
My leader asked me to tell
you to keep this civilized.

380
00:21:38.297 --> 00:21:39.198
if possible.

381
00:21:40.867 --> 00:21:43.870
- From the looks of you.
I know who your leader is.

382
00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:47.239
And the word is. he's as
dead as a hog on a spit.

383
00:21:47.239 --> 00:21:50.242
- Amleth lives through
his son. Finnr the Brave.

384
00:21:51.578 --> 00:21:54.781
- Oh. Finnr the
baby's all grown up.

385
00:21:54.781 --> 00:21:55.848
- He's a man now.

386
00:21:56.716 --> 00:21:58.017
- More than you'll be.

387
00:21:58.017 --> 00:22:00.387
once I squash your
tiny pecker into jelly.

388
00:22:00.387 --> 00:22:01.788
- And he wants your family.

389
00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:08.495
- Leave now or I'll smash
your tiny bastard brains in.

390
00:22:09.261 --> 00:22:11.063
(yelling)

391
00:22:11.063 --> 00:22:13.833
(dramatic music)

392
00:22:13.833 --> 00:22:16.803
(both moaning)

393
00:22:16.803 --> 00:22:19.706
(dramatic music)

394
00:22:28.247 --> 00:22:29.682
(both moaning)

395
00:22:29.682 --> 00:22:31.418
(swords clanging)

396
00:22:31.418 --> 00:22:34.220
(dramatic music)

397
00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:40.359
(both moaning)

398
00:22:42.161 --> 00:22:44.964
(dramatic music)

399
00:22:55.742 --> 00:22:59.111
(both moaning)

400
00:22:59.111 --> 00:23:01.848
(dramatic music)

401
00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.089
- I'll beat you in
the game. so we could.

402
00:23:10.089 --> 00:23:11.624
Just means you'll suffer longer.

403
00:23:11.624 --> 00:23:13.493
- Suffer this. shit stain.

404
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:19.666
(Gunnar screaming)

405
00:23:19.666 --> 00:23:22.569
(dramatic music)

406
00:23:37.349 --> 00:23:40.720
- We need to go. now.

407
00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.789
(birds chirping)

408
00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:45.525
(gentle music)

409
00:23:45.525 --> 00:23:48.027
(birds chirping)

410
00:23:48.027 --> 00:23:50.763
(gentle music)

411
00:23:52.031 --> 00:23:53.533
- You have the will
and the strength

412
00:23:53.533 --> 00:23:55.502
of the great bear
on your side. Finnr.

413
00:23:59.071 --> 00:24:00.607
- I should be out there.

414
00:24:00.607 --> 00:24:02.675
on the hunt with our sons.

415
00:24:02.675 --> 00:24:04.176
- No need.

416
00:24:04.176 --> 00:24:06.513
Soon your enemies will
be dragged before you.

417
00:24:07.514 --> 00:24:08.981
The animal spirits will it.

418
00:24:10.082 --> 00:24:12.819
(gentle music)

419
00:24:14.987 --> 00:24:18.357
- I just wish I knew what
was going on out there.

420
00:24:18.357 --> 00:24:19.626
- A messenger will come.

421
00:24:20.693 --> 00:24:22.729
- Yeah. but not
fast enough. Mother.

422
00:24:22.729 --> 00:24:25.865
I want to know now and I
want to know everything.

423
00:24:25.865 --> 00:24:27.767
I just.
- Sh. sh. sh. sh. sh.

424
00:24:27.767 --> 00:24:29.068
Patience.

425
00:24:29.068 --> 00:24:31.704
(gentle music)

426
00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.609
We will bathe in
blood. together.

427
00:24:38.344 --> 00:24:39.879
once the games are over.

428
00:24:41.648 --> 00:24:44.884
(gentle upbeat music)

429
00:24:54.561 --> 00:24:57.363
(birds chirping)

430
00:24:58.865 --> 00:25:02.101
(gentle upbeat music)

431
00:25:04.403 --> 00:25:05.672
- Let's get some water.

432
00:25:12.378 --> 00:25:15.147
- You know that one
was not a happy cherub.

433
00:25:15.147 --> 00:25:19.151
Anyone who'd think that these
animals have love for Amleth.

434
00:25:19.151 --> 00:25:20.620
- Well. they are people too.

435
00:25:21.453 --> 00:25:22.488
- Not in my book.

436
00:25:25.357 --> 00:25:29.629
- Have you forgotten all the
horrors we saw men do in war.

437
00:25:29.629 --> 00:25:30.830
what we did?

438
00:25:31.731 --> 00:25:32.799
- We're not at war.

439
00:25:32.799 --> 00:25:34.333
- But they are.

440
00:25:34.333 --> 00:25:36.703
These barbarians are closer
to their natural human state

441
00:25:36.703 --> 00:25:38.470
than we care to admit.

442
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:40.973
- Don't even think that. Ander.

443
00:25:40.973 --> 00:25:44.644
- Well. the gods did make
us all. better or worse.

444
00:25:44.644 --> 00:25:45.878
- Oh really?

445
00:25:45.878 --> 00:25:49.048
Well then I guess even
the gods get blind drunk

446
00:25:49.048 --> 00:25:50.850
and screw things up.

447
00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:53.886
- I thought Amleth could
be swayed. reasoned with.

448
00:25:53.886 --> 00:25:56.656
But look at what my
mistake has cost us.

449
00:25:56.656 --> 00:25:58.057
As soon as I got word of him.

450
00:25:58.057 --> 00:26:00.192
I should have just
marched us outta there.

451
00:26:01.594 --> 00:26:04.997
- No one accused you of having
the wisdom of Mamir. Brother.

452
00:26:04.997 --> 00:26:06.699
- Shut up. Gunnar.

453
00:26:06.699 --> 00:26:08.901
You still think we're
impervious to death?

454
00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:12.171
- We head West and then what?

455
00:26:13.439 --> 00:26:17.777
- A life by the
coast. even by sea.

456
00:26:17.777 --> 00:26:18.778
We have gold.

457
00:26:19.712 --> 00:26:21.447
Our options are endless.

458
00:26:21.447 --> 00:26:24.483
Perhaps. find a supple
maiden for this one.

459
00:26:25.584 --> 00:26:28.520
- I'm still married.
Brother. still married.

460
00:26:29.956 --> 00:26:32.692
Your son is a cheeky bugger.

461
00:26:32.692 --> 00:26:34.193
but he does give me hope.

462
00:26:36.963 --> 00:26:39.766
(dramatic music)

463
00:26:40.566 --> 00:26:41.400
(birds chirping)

464
00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.334
(dramatic music)

465
00:26:42.334 --> 00:26:44.904
- What's this. a family party?

466
00:26:44.904 --> 00:26:46.839
- Gro. go with them.

467
00:26:46.839 --> 00:26:49.709
(dramatic music)

468
00:26:49.709 --> 00:26:50.977
- I don't think we're invited.

469
00:26:50.977 --> 00:26:52.111
- I don't care.

470
00:26:52.111 --> 00:26:54.881
(dramatic music)

471
00:26:54.881 --> 00:26:56.348
- We can take them.

472
00:26:56.348 --> 00:26:57.549
- We can take them.

473
00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:00.753
You have to keep them safe. boy.

474
00:27:00.753 --> 00:27:03.389
There's greatness in your
blood. you little shit.

475
00:27:03.389 --> 00:27:05.491
(dramatic music)

476
00:27:05.491 --> 00:27:07.059
- Go. quickly.

477
00:27:08.094 --> 00:27:10.496
(dramatic music)

478
00:27:10.496 --> 00:27:13.099
- I was hoping to never
have to do this again.

479
00:27:13.099 --> 00:27:15.001
- Likewise. little brother.

480
00:27:15.001 --> 00:27:17.536
- Cut us down and we'll
come back as wolves

481
00:27:17.536 --> 00:27:19.305
and eat your bones.

482
00:27:19.305 --> 00:27:20.539
- You know what?

483
00:27:20.539 --> 00:27:22.742
I'd really like to
see you do that.

484
00:27:22.742 --> 00:27:25.177
(fighter yelling)

485
00:27:25.177 --> 00:27:28.080
(dramatic music)

486
00:27:29.849 --> 00:27:31.317
(swords clanging)

487
00:27:31.317 --> 00:27:34.153
(dramatic music)

488
00:27:34.153 --> 00:27:36.723
(all moaning)

489
00:27:38.457 --> 00:27:41.293
(dramatic music)

490
00:27:52.204 --> 00:27:54.206
(swords clanging)

491
00:27:54.206 --> 00:27:57.009
(dramatic music)

492
00:28:05.051 --> 00:28:07.686
(all shouting)

493
00:28:09.789 --> 00:28:12.624
(dramatic music)

494
00:28:14.693 --> 00:28:16.863
- It's bad luck to
die by a river. Ander.

495
00:28:16.863 --> 00:28:18.831
Come and join the games
and die with dignity.

496
00:28:18.831 --> 00:28:20.967
(Ander shouting)

497
00:28:20.967 --> 00:28:24.303
(dramatic music)

498
00:28:24.303 --> 00:28:27.106
(Ander shouting)

499
00:28:27.974 --> 00:28:30.777
(dramatic music)

500
00:28:36.182 --> 00:28:38.985
(Ander shouting)

501
00:28:40.119 --> 00:28:41.320
- That one's dead.

502
00:28:42.321 --> 00:28:45.691
(birds chirping)

503
00:28:45.691 --> 00:28:46.759
- [Gro] Hurry.

504
00:28:46.759 --> 00:28:47.960
- But Father and Uncle.

505
00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.796
- Oh. you see a doting
father and uncle.

506
00:28:49.796 --> 00:28:52.098
but those men were
warriors. the very best.

507
00:28:52.098 --> 00:28:53.532
and that does not change.

508
00:28:53.532 --> 00:28:55.534
You'll pity for the
wretches that attacked us.

509
00:28:55.534 --> 00:28:57.069
And they will join us soon.

510
00:28:58.304 --> 00:29:01.140
(dramatic music)

511
00:29:03.709 --> 00:29:05.577
- Look. over here.

512
00:29:05.577 --> 00:29:06.412
Quick. hide.

513
00:29:06.412 --> 00:29:07.513
- Oh.
- Wait for them.

514
00:29:07.513 --> 00:29:08.614
I must go back for the others.

515
00:29:08.614 --> 00:29:09.849
- You're just like your father.

516
00:29:09.849 --> 00:29:11.283
Did you not hear what I
just said to your sis.

517
00:29:11.283 --> 00:29:12.218
Hilda.

518
00:29:12.218 --> 00:29:13.052
Hilda.

519
00:29:13.052 --> 00:29:14.153
- Hilda.

520
00:29:14.153 --> 00:29:17.056
(dramatic music)

521
00:29:21.593 --> 00:29:23.595
- Where is my daughter?

522
00:29:23.595 --> 00:29:25.631
Where is my daughter?

523
00:29:25.631 --> 00:29:27.366
(both moaning)

524
00:29:27.366 --> 00:29:30.803
(swords clanging)

525
00:29:30.803 --> 00:29:32.872
(dramatic music)

526
00:29:32.872 --> 00:29:34.874
(both moaning)

527
00:29:34.874 --> 00:29:37.676
(swords clanging)

528
00:29:37.676 --> 00:29:40.679
(dramatic music)

529
00:29:40.679 --> 00:29:42.148
- [Gro] Go.

530
00:29:42.148 --> 00:29:44.683
(both moaning)

531
00:29:44.683 --> 00:29:47.586
(dramatic music)

532
00:29:52.291 --> 00:29:53.926
- I'll catch you next time. boy.

533
00:29:53.926 --> 00:29:55.862
And there will be a next time.

534
00:29:55.862 --> 00:29:57.729
- I am no boy.

535
00:29:57.729 --> 00:29:59.498
Where is she?

536
00:29:59.498 --> 00:30:01.868
Where is my sister?

537
00:30:01.868 --> 00:30:02.768
Come back.

538
00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:05.371
(birds chirping)

539
00:30:05.371 --> 00:30:06.272
Mother.

540
00:30:09.141 --> 00:30:10.042
- Hilda.

541
00:30:11.143 --> 00:30:12.044
Hilda.

542
00:30:13.612 --> 00:30:15.781
(crying)

543
00:30:22.288 --> 00:30:23.890
- Mother.

544
00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:24.790
Mother.

545
00:30:27.293 --> 00:30:29.195
Pull yourself together.

546
00:30:29.195 --> 00:30:30.562
We will find her.

547
00:30:30.562 --> 00:30:32.564
but we must get the others.

548
00:30:32.564 --> 00:30:36.435
I promise you. we will
have those savages gutted

549
00:30:36.435 --> 00:30:38.437
and begging Oden
for forgiveness.

550
00:30:40.006 --> 00:30:42.808
- Let me say a prayer.

551
00:30:42.808 --> 00:30:44.810
(gentle music)

552
00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:47.079
(birds chirping)

553
00:30:47.079 --> 00:30:50.149
Oh mighty. oh
father. mighty Oden.

554
00:30:51.117 --> 00:30:52.584
keep my daughter safe.

555
00:30:56.488 --> 00:30:59.858
Keep my daughter safe. lord.
until we meet again here.

556
00:30:59.858 --> 00:31:00.626
Hear Oden.

557
00:31:02.361 --> 00:31:04.030
Hilda. oh my Hilda.

558
00:31:05.031 --> 00:31:07.733
(gentle music)

559
00:31:07.733 --> 00:31:11.570
Please. mighty oh
father. protect my baby.

560
00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:13.372
(gentle music)

561
00:31:13.372 --> 00:31:15.507
(crying)

562
00:31:18.945 --> 00:31:20.446
Gro.

563
00:31:20.446 --> 00:31:23.349
(dramatic music)

564
00:31:40.499 --> 00:31:44.570
- Hey boys. wait there.
I'm coming for you.

565
00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:47.373
(dramatic music)

566
00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.881
I wished this morning
that I'd have the chance

567
00:31:55.881 --> 00:31:57.883
to kill two soft-hands at once.

568
00:32:00.519 --> 00:32:02.788
It seems my dreams
have been answered.

569
00:32:02.788 --> 00:32:06.025
I'll enjoy draping your
skins over my shoulders.

570
00:32:06.025 --> 00:32:07.359
- Soft-hands?

571
00:32:07.359 --> 00:32:08.627
Have you any idea who we are.

572
00:32:08.627 --> 00:32:10.429
you stinking glove
of cock cheese?

573
00:32:13.265 --> 00:32:14.700
- Gunnar.

574
00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:15.801
- Yeah?

575
00:32:15.801 --> 00:32:17.103
- Shut up and fight.

576
00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:19.771
- Oh. yes. of course.

577
00:32:20.939 --> 00:32:23.842
(dramatic music)

578
00:32:25.777 --> 00:32:27.413
- You.

579
00:32:27.413 --> 00:32:30.316
(dramatic music)

580
00:32:36.088 --> 00:32:37.289
(fighter laughing)

581
00:32:37.289 --> 00:32:39.091
- [Ander] Come on.

582
00:32:39.091 --> 00:32:40.526
- Come on.

583
00:32:40.526 --> 00:32:41.360
That's it.

584
00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:43.229
(dramatic music)

585
00:32:43.229 --> 00:32:45.231
(both moaning)

586
00:32:45.231 --> 00:32:48.134
(dramatic music)

587
00:32:59.278 --> 00:33:01.313
(fighter laughing)

588
00:33:01.313 --> 00:33:04.216
(dramatic music)

589
00:33:53.199 --> 00:33:55.534
- Big. but no brains.

590
00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:02.308
- Where will we be in
generations to come?

591
00:34:02.308 --> 00:34:04.410
In 20 generations?

592
00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:07.213
- Descendants of brutal heathens

593
00:34:07.213 --> 00:34:10.182
obsessed with cult followings.
by the looks of it.

594
00:34:13.819 --> 00:34:16.222
- We need to catch
up with the others.

595
00:34:16.222 --> 00:34:20.526
These Berserkers must
know we're traveling West.

596
00:34:20.526 --> 00:34:24.563
- I really wish everyone would
stop calling 'em Berserkers.

597
00:34:24.563 --> 00:34:27.399
We fought with Berserkers.
they're good men.

598
00:34:27.399 --> 00:34:32.338
other than the parts
where they went berserk.

599
00:34:32.338 --> 00:34:35.107
- How did they
know where we were?

600
00:34:36.242 --> 00:34:38.210
- Maybe they have
something we don't.

601
00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.149
- Enough rest. lazy brother.

602
00:34:43.149 --> 00:34:45.451
We need to catch
up with the others.

603
00:34:45.451 --> 00:34:48.354
(dramatic music)

604
00:34:51.923 --> 00:34:52.824
- Father.

605
00:34:56.762 --> 00:34:57.663
- Where's Hilda?

606
00:34:58.864 --> 00:35:01.133
(dramatic music)

607
00:35:01.133 --> 00:35:02.834
Where's Hilda?

608
00:35:02.834 --> 00:35:05.304
(dramatic music)

609
00:35:05.304 --> 00:35:08.039
(birds chirping)

610
00:35:08.039 --> 00:35:10.942
(dramatic music)

611
00:35:18.517 --> 00:35:20.419
- You are the daughter
of the wicked man

612
00:35:20.419 --> 00:35:22.521
who killed my husband.

613
00:35:22.521 --> 00:35:24.756
- Father is no wicked man.

614
00:35:25.991 --> 00:35:27.493
He is gentle.

615
00:35:27.493 --> 00:35:29.895
- Gentle enough to
behead by one true love?

616
00:35:31.029 --> 00:35:33.499
- Miss. I am deeply
sorry for your loss.

617
00:35:34.866 --> 00:35:37.169
but I assure you that
anything my father did.

618
00:35:37.169 --> 00:35:39.705
he only did to
protect his family.

619
00:35:41.973 --> 00:35:43.875
- What about my family?

620
00:35:43.875 --> 00:35:45.377
- Do you call those barbarians

621
00:35:45.377 --> 00:35:47.145
that dragged me
here. your family?

622
00:35:48.747 --> 00:35:52.150
- They're only human until they
meet their gods. of course.

623
00:35:54.253 --> 00:35:56.822
I'm very fortunate to
have bared two sons.

624
00:35:56.822 --> 00:35:58.290
no daughter. thank the wolf.

625
00:35:59.558 --> 00:36:01.827
You're a pathetic
excuse for a warrior.

626
00:36:01.827 --> 00:36:03.695
- I am no warrior.

627
00:36:03.695 --> 00:36:05.431
I don't wanna play your games.

628
00:36:06.765 --> 00:36:08.667
I just wanna be
an ordinary girl.

629
00:36:09.901 --> 00:36:11.903
- Hence why I'm lucky
to have no daughter.

630
00:36:11.903 --> 00:36:15.040
- Please. I don't wanna fight.

631
00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.476
- You have no choice. darling.

632
00:36:17.476 --> 00:36:19.645
Besides. it's only recent

633
00:36:19.645 --> 00:36:20.946
that women were
allowed in the games.

634
00:36:20.946 --> 00:36:22.714
I believe you
should be thankful.

635
00:36:22.714 --> 00:36:24.783
- I believe in the
unity of human.

636
00:36:24.783 --> 00:36:27.586
- Like I said. we won't
be humans forever.

637
00:36:28.754 --> 00:36:32.224
We are the animals
that stalk the Earth.

638
00:36:32.224 --> 00:36:33.959
the howling in the night.

639
00:36:36.094 --> 00:36:38.129
- You are no animals.

640
00:36:38.129 --> 00:36:40.566
- Perhaps one day the world
will be more enlightened.

641
00:36:40.566 --> 00:36:42.000
- How can you do this?

642
00:36:42.834 --> 00:36:45.771
You feel pain. you bleed.

643
00:36:46.838 --> 00:36:50.709
You've had two children
and you survived.

644
00:36:50.709 --> 00:36:53.512
Life is a gift
given by the gods.

645
00:36:53.512 --> 00:36:55.213
- Not by your gods.

646
00:36:56.648 --> 00:37:00.018
We have suffered many
winters and summers.

647
00:37:00.018 --> 00:37:01.487
finding our place in this world

648
00:37:01.487 --> 00:37:04.122
through the primal
wisdom of the great bear.

649
00:37:04.122 --> 00:37:06.558
- I don't understand.
- I don't expect you to.

650
00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:11.162
(birds chirping)

651
00:37:15.267 --> 00:37:16.568
I was younger than you

652
00:37:18.036 --> 00:37:21.740
when the Vikings stormed
into my land. my village.

653
00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:24.310
taking anything they
wanted. like me.

654
00:37:25.711 --> 00:37:29.881
Burning everything they
didn't. like my brothers.

655
00:37:31.049 --> 00:37:33.218
I can't even remember
their names anymore.

656
00:37:36.288 --> 00:37:38.256
The only one who
showed me any kindness

657
00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:41.593
was the man your father
would call a Berserker.

658
00:37:41.593 --> 00:37:44.095
The dirty warriors
for the dirty jobs.

659
00:37:44.095 --> 00:37:45.864
the insane. the remorseless.

660
00:37:48.434 --> 00:37:53.505
He found me with three
supposedly noble vikings

661
00:37:54.172 --> 00:37:55.507
taking turns on me.

662
00:37:56.742 --> 00:37:59.378
And he ripped them apart.

663
00:38:00.712 --> 00:38:04.783
and he took me away. fed
me. clothed me. let me heal.

664
00:38:06.785 --> 00:38:08.320
He didn't even try to touch me

665
00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.456
until I made it clear
that I wanted it.

666
00:38:13.091 --> 00:38:14.259
His name was Amleth.

667
00:38:15.627 --> 00:38:19.030
(birds chirping)

668
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:21.633
One man's villain is
another one's hero.

669
00:38:21.633 --> 00:38:24.836
- Why did your husband
hate my father?

670
00:38:28.407 --> 00:38:30.609
- You asked me
about giving birth.

671
00:38:30.609 --> 00:38:33.745
When Finnr came out of
me. I was 13-years-old.

672
00:38:33.745 --> 00:38:35.981
I was lying. bleeding.

673
00:38:35.981 --> 00:38:38.817
torn open on the
floor of a dark cave.

674
00:38:38.817 --> 00:38:40.852
Three things kept me alive.

675
00:38:40.852 --> 00:38:44.189
Amleth. by my side.
holding my hand.

676
00:38:44.189 --> 00:38:47.426
love. for my baby and
the animal spirits world

677
00:38:47.426 --> 00:38:52.498
and hate. for you.
naive. fairytale-loving.

678
00:38:53.164 --> 00:38:54.566
soft-handed heathens.

679
00:38:57.469 --> 00:38:59.771
The same when Bodil
ripped his way out.

680
00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:05.176
Amleth returned from war.
simply to hold my hand.

681
00:39:09.147 --> 00:39:11.417
And where is he now?

682
00:39:12.451 --> 00:39:15.186
(gentle music)

683
00:39:23.562 --> 00:39:25.764
- Which way did they take her?

684
00:39:25.764 --> 00:39:27.933
- They went North. I think.

685
00:39:27.933 --> 00:39:29.100
- You think?

686
00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:30.335
- There were men

687
00:39:30.335 --> 00:39:32.771
trying to lop my head
off at the time. Uncle.

688
00:39:32.771 --> 00:39:34.606
- Sorry. boy. you did good.

689
00:39:35.874 --> 00:39:37.142
We just need to be sure.

690
00:39:38.844 --> 00:39:41.780
North. the death field.

691
00:39:42.914 --> 00:39:44.450
- I must save her.

692
00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:45.784
- Let me go with you. Father.

693
00:39:45.784 --> 00:39:47.218
- No.

694
00:39:47.218 --> 00:39:48.420
- Why?

695
00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:49.688
- Two reasons.

696
00:39:49.688 --> 00:39:54.225
First. one man alone.
I can go in. sneak in.

697
00:39:54.225 --> 00:39:56.495
as quiet as an ant's farm.

698
00:39:58.129 --> 00:40:00.331
Second. your mother
and I need you here.

699
00:40:03.201 --> 00:40:05.704
Keep traveling West.
towards the coast.

700
00:40:06.838 --> 00:40:10.408
I will catch up
you and with Hilda.

701
00:40:10.408 --> 00:40:11.943
- Yes.

702
00:40:11.943 --> 00:40:14.045
you and Hilda.

703
00:40:14.045 --> 00:40:15.246
- Unharmed.

704
00:40:15.246 --> 00:40:16.815
- You and Hilda.

705
00:40:21.086 --> 00:40:22.621
- We will conquer this.

706
00:40:24.289 --> 00:40:26.324
Any last jokes before
I leave. Brother?

707
00:40:27.459 --> 00:40:29.461
- Hardly the right
time or place is it?

708
00:40:30.762 --> 00:40:33.799
God. you're so
inappropriate. Brother.

709
00:40:33.799 --> 00:40:34.800
Very embarrassing.

710
00:40:36.167 --> 00:40:38.870
(dramatic music)

711
00:40:48.213 --> 00:40:51.850
(sings in foreign language)

712
00:40:53.852 --> 00:40:56.555
(dramatic music)

713
00:40:57.789 --> 00:41:01.359
(sings in foreign language)

714
00:41:05.697 --> 00:41:08.600
(dramatic music)

715
00:41:10.502 --> 00:41:11.503
- I need to piss.

716
00:41:18.009 --> 00:41:19.645
- He's good with a sword.

717
00:41:19.645 --> 00:41:21.046
- You should have seen him.

718
00:41:22.413 --> 00:41:25.250
I didn't know whether to be
proud or scared for his soul.

719
00:41:26.351 --> 00:41:27.786
Have you been teaching him?

720
00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:31.557
- Ander told me not to.
no matter how he begged.

721
00:41:31.557 --> 00:41:32.891
- Then it's in his blood.

722
00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:36.461
And he has taught himself.

723
00:41:36.461 --> 00:41:37.696
- Where'd he get
that sword then?

724
00:41:37.696 --> 00:41:40.065
- He's of age. he bought
it with his own coin.

725
00:41:41.432 --> 00:41:43.201
- Has he?

726
00:41:43.201 --> 00:41:44.002
- What?

727
00:41:45.303 --> 00:41:46.538
- Felt the rage?

728
00:41:46.538 --> 00:41:47.806
- Not that I have seen.

729
00:41:47.806 --> 00:41:50.909
but I know that it is
inside. Gro. within him.

730
00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:54.913
- I can hear you
talking about me.

731
00:41:54.913 --> 00:41:58.617
- Yeah. talking about
you. not to you.

732
00:41:58.617 --> 00:42:00.752
March on. one. two.
three. one. two. three.

733
00:42:03.288 --> 00:42:06.558
Freda always had the power
to keep my rage in check.

734
00:42:07.492 --> 00:42:08.660
She was like a tonic.

735
00:42:10.028 --> 00:42:12.664
- How do you keep it in
check now that she's gone?

736
00:42:12.664 --> 00:42:15.567
- Well why do you think
I always stayed near her?

737
00:42:15.567 --> 00:42:17.502
Thanks to you and Ander.

738
00:42:17.502 --> 00:42:19.170
I know she's always with me now.

739
00:42:19.938 --> 00:42:22.741
(gentle music)

740
00:42:22.741 --> 00:42:25.611
Hence. calm as a summer wind.

741
00:42:27.545 --> 00:42:28.780
Even in the heat of battle.

742
00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:31.216
I always can hear
her voice of reason.

743
00:42:33.051 --> 00:42:34.820
She does go on though.

744
00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:36.888
Yack. yack. yack. yack. yack.

745
00:42:36.888 --> 00:42:37.789
Same as ever.

746
00:42:40.458 --> 00:42:41.259
- Quiet.

747
00:42:41.259 --> 00:42:42.293
- What is it?

748
00:42:42.293 --> 00:42:43.729
- I sense danger.

749
00:42:43.729 --> 00:42:46.131
- What. are you
clairvoyant now. boy?

750
00:42:47.032 --> 00:42:48.800
- I doubt he has such a power.

751
00:42:50.568 --> 00:42:54.305
Worshiping false
gods. as you all do.

752
00:42:54.305 --> 00:42:58.309
- Oh. it's all right.
it's just a few animals.

753
00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:00.411
Have you met Gudrind?

754
00:43:01.279 --> 00:43:02.513
Some of your pals have.

755
00:43:02.513 --> 00:43:04.582
but they're a bit
dead to tell the tale.

756
00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:07.385
- Animals. aren't we all?

757
00:43:08.654 --> 00:43:11.122
Like the man call
Ander. for example.

758
00:43:11.122 --> 00:43:13.191
He's one but the great beasts.

759
00:43:13.992 --> 00:43:15.593
You too. his brother.

760
00:43:16.527 --> 00:43:17.562
I forget your name.

761
00:43:18.864 --> 00:43:20.398
- Don't worry.

762
00:43:20.398 --> 00:43:23.368
I'll soon hammer it
into your memory.

763
00:43:23.368 --> 00:43:24.469
- A witty one too.

764
00:43:26.137 --> 00:43:28.473
Remember boys. I
want them alive.

765
00:43:28.473 --> 00:43:29.374
- That's funny.

766
00:43:30.541 --> 00:43:32.844
I was just thinking
the opposite about you.

767
00:43:33.611 --> 00:43:36.347
(dramatic music)

768
00:43:36.347 --> 00:43:38.216
Just a warmup for
the games to come.

769
00:43:39.517 --> 00:43:42.420
(dramatic music)

770
00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:07.645
(all shouting)

771
00:44:15.486 --> 00:44:16.755
- Get him.

772
00:44:16.755 --> 00:44:19.524
(dramatic music)

773
00:44:19.524 --> 00:44:22.260
- You too afraid to fight
me by yourself Finnr?

774
00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:24.629
(dramatic music)

775
00:44:24.629 --> 00:44:25.897
- He's mine.

776
00:44:25.897 --> 00:44:28.700
(dramatic music)

777
00:44:31.469 --> 00:44:34.539
(fighters shouting)

778
00:44:36.007 --> 00:44:38.810
(dramatic music)

779
00:44:41.612 --> 00:44:44.182
(all moaning)

780
00:44:45.516 --> 00:44:48.186
(dramatic music)

781
00:44:48.186 --> 00:44:50.756
(all moaning)

782
00:44:51.757 --> 00:44:54.592
(dramatic music)

783
00:45:02.233 --> 00:45:04.335
(shouting)

784
00:45:04.335 --> 00:45:05.170
(dramatic music)

785
00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:07.906
(both shouting)

786
00:45:09.507 --> 00:45:12.343
(dramatic music)

787
00:45:21.019 --> 00:45:23.588
(all moaning)

788
00:45:27.025 --> 00:45:29.928
(dramatic music)

789
00:45:47.478 --> 00:45:48.379
- Coward.

790
00:45:50.748 --> 00:45:52.417
Let us go.

791
00:45:52.417 --> 00:45:53.952
(dramatic music)

792
00:45:53.952 --> 00:45:57.755
- Do you have any idea how
silly a request that is?

793
00:45:57.755 --> 00:45:59.925
(dramatic music)

794
00:45:59.925 --> 00:46:02.260
I mean. I literally
came all this way

795
00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:03.628
just to come and take you.

796
00:46:04.395 --> 00:46:05.831
Why would I let you go?

797
00:46:13.471 --> 00:46:15.306
How pathetic.

798
00:46:15.306 --> 00:46:17.909
I've seen birds make
much of an effort

799
00:46:17.909 --> 00:46:19.477
just to continue forth.

800
00:46:20.278 --> 00:46:21.813
- I won't let you hurt them.

801
00:46:21.813 --> 00:46:23.281
- And how would you stop me?

802
00:46:26.017 --> 00:46:29.587
Imagine what Freda will
say if she saw you now.

803
00:46:29.587 --> 00:46:31.256
- How dare he say her name. you.

804
00:46:34.826 --> 00:46:37.395
- Ah. Gunnar. that's the one.

805
00:46:38.363 --> 00:46:39.330
That's the name.

806
00:46:41.432 --> 00:46:43.401
You have no use in my games.

807
00:46:43.401 --> 00:46:46.204
I just wish you the best.

808
00:46:46.204 --> 00:46:47.538
A place in the afterlife

809
00:46:47.538 --> 00:46:51.609
and hopefully the
forgiveness of the true gods.

810
00:46:51.609 --> 00:46:54.545
A blissful. eternal existence

811
00:46:54.545 --> 00:46:56.681
next to your beloved Freda.

812
00:46:57.582 --> 00:46:59.217
- Had to say name again. huh?

813
00:47:00.051 --> 00:47:02.720
(Gunnar shouting)

814
00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:07.792
- Your main use now is to
set an example for these two.

815
00:47:08.593 --> 00:47:09.861
to show them what happens

816
00:47:09.861 --> 00:47:14.365
when someone disobey
my father's wishes.

817
00:47:14.365 --> 00:47:18.103
- No. please. please. no.

818
00:47:18.103 --> 00:47:20.738
Please. please. no. no. please.

819
00:47:24.275 --> 00:47:26.744
- It's all right.
it's all right.

820
00:47:26.744 --> 00:47:28.446
It's gonna be all right.

821
00:47:28.446 --> 00:47:32.650
Gro. make sure you lynch these
fools for your uncle. huh.

822
00:47:33.618 --> 00:47:35.620
(dramatic music)

823
00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:37.688
You hear me. you little shit.

824
00:47:37.688 --> 00:47:39.090
- Stop.

825
00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:39.991
Stop.

826
00:47:41.659 --> 00:47:42.961
- [Gunnar] You piece of shit.

827
00:47:42.961 --> 00:47:44.262
- No. please.

828
00:47:44.262 --> 00:47:47.165
(dramatic music)

829
00:47:49.634 --> 00:47:50.468
(Olga screaming)

830
00:47:50.468 --> 00:47:53.471
(dramatic music)

831
00:47:53.471 --> 00:47:56.274
(both screaming)

832
00:47:58.043 --> 00:48:00.878
(dramatic music)

833
00:48:09.454 --> 00:48:13.925
- Now. simple question. even
an old lady can understand.

834
00:48:14.725 --> 00:48:16.227
Where is my star competitor?

835
00:48:16.227 --> 00:48:18.829
- I'll never tell you.

836
00:48:20.365 --> 00:48:24.202
- Where is Ander?

837
00:48:24.202 --> 00:48:27.072
(dramatic music)

838
00:48:43.621 --> 00:48:45.223
- The man who killed my father.

839
00:48:46.757 --> 00:48:50.028
I bet you thought I'd be
easy compared to my brother.

840
00:48:50.028 --> 00:48:51.662
That's what everyone thinks.

841
00:48:51.662 --> 00:48:54.699
- I've never even thought
anything about you.

842
00:48:54.699 --> 00:48:56.867
I don't even know
your name. boy.

843
00:48:56.867 --> 00:49:00.038
- Bodil. the last
name you'll ever hear.

844
00:49:00.038 --> 00:49:01.506
- Lucky me.

845
00:49:01.506 --> 00:49:04.775
- I thought your brother was
the one with the stupid tongue.

846
00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:06.211
- My brother's not here.

847
00:49:07.912 --> 00:49:08.813
- True.

848
00:49:09.714 --> 00:49:12.517
(dramatic music)

849
00:49:15.686 --> 00:49:18.823
(birds chirping)

850
00:49:18.823 --> 00:49:21.726
(dramatic music)

851
00:49:29.434 --> 00:49:31.102
- Father.

852
00:49:31.102 --> 00:49:32.037
- My son.

853
00:49:32.037 --> 00:49:33.438
- Tell me this is a nightmare.

854
00:49:34.839 --> 00:49:37.575
- It would be a gift from
the Old Father if it was.

855
00:49:37.575 --> 00:49:38.976
- This is for my fault.

856
00:49:38.976 --> 00:49:40.411
It's all my fault.

857
00:49:40.411 --> 00:49:43.214
- No. not my angel.

858
00:49:43.214 --> 00:49:45.250
this is far from your fault.

859
00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:47.685
- No. it is. it is.

860
00:49:47.685 --> 00:49:51.722
- No. it is them and them alone.

861
00:49:51.722 --> 00:49:52.757
No. them and I.

862
00:49:54.559 --> 00:49:55.826
- I don't understand. Father.

863
00:49:55.826 --> 00:49:58.429
what exactly did you do
to make this your fault?

864
00:49:58.429 --> 00:49:59.530
- Amleth and I.

865
00:50:02.333 --> 00:50:03.201
Gunnar?

866
00:50:05.236 --> 00:50:06.137
Gunnar?

867
00:50:07.272 --> 00:50:10.241
- Oh yes. Uncle. he'll
save us. silly Uncle.

868
00:50:14.045 --> 00:50:16.147
- Where's my brother. Hilda?

869
00:50:16.147 --> 00:50:18.249
Gro. where is my brother?

870
00:50:20.085 --> 00:50:21.086
- Finnr got him.

871
00:50:24.622 --> 00:50:26.757
Sorry Father. we did
everything we could.

872
00:50:28.793 --> 00:50:30.961
(crying)

873
00:50:30.961 --> 00:50:33.298
- I know you did.

874
00:50:33.298 --> 00:50:34.732
I know you did.

875
00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:38.503
(birds chirping)

876
00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:45.476
Boy. you. I have a question.

877
00:50:46.911 --> 00:50:48.546
- Ander this isn't
going to help.

878
00:50:49.647 --> 00:50:51.416
- What do you want?

879
00:50:51.416 --> 00:50:54.619
- I told you I have a question.

880
00:50:54.619 --> 00:50:56.254
- Go on.

881
00:50:56.254 --> 00:50:59.190
- When you're all done sucking
off each other's cheesy cocks

882
00:50:59.190 --> 00:51:03.328
and moving on to the torment
of innocent women and children.

883
00:51:03.328 --> 00:51:05.596
do you ever stop and wipe
the jizz from your face

884
00:51:05.596 --> 00:51:09.200
and think. "Am I the bad guy?

885
00:51:10.535 --> 00:51:13.371
"Am I really more
worthless than pig shit

886
00:51:13.371 --> 00:51:15.140
"on the bottom of my boot?"

887
00:51:16.474 --> 00:51:19.076
Do you ever wonder what
your whore mother must think

888
00:51:19.076 --> 00:51:20.044
if she could see you.

889
00:51:20.044 --> 00:51:22.313
- I ought to bleed you out

890
00:51:22.313 --> 00:51:23.548
with your precious family.

891
00:51:23.548 --> 00:51:25.950
- No. no. leave us
be. leave us me.

892
00:51:26.917 --> 00:51:28.753
- Everyone. calm down.

893
00:51:30.621 --> 00:51:32.157
I'm finished making my point.

894
00:51:33.558 --> 00:51:34.459
How about it?

895
00:51:34.459 --> 00:51:36.494
You versus me.

896
00:51:37.595 --> 00:51:40.598
Take these chains off.
let's see what happens.

897
00:51:41.699 --> 00:51:44.335
I've been bleeding for hours.

898
00:51:44.335 --> 00:51:45.470
I'm getting old.

899
00:51:46.871 --> 00:51:47.805
How about it?

900
00:51:48.739 --> 00:51:50.308
- No. Father.

901
00:51:50.308 --> 00:51:52.810
- It would be the most
honorable thing you have done

902
00:51:52.810 --> 00:51:56.314
since you let your father
sodomize you for half price.

903
00:51:56.314 --> 00:51:58.549
- Leave those fools.

904
00:51:58.549 --> 00:52:01.319
- Permission to disempower
his man before the games.

905
00:52:01.319 --> 00:52:02.787
- Denied.

906
00:52:02.787 --> 00:52:05.856
What do you think my brother
would say if I let you do that?

907
00:52:05.856 --> 00:52:07.425
Now go.

908
00:52:07.425 --> 00:52:08.293
- Aye. Sir.

909
00:52:14.332 --> 00:52:16.934
- So how are we all feeling?

910
00:52:18.536 --> 00:52:19.804
- I'll offer you a deal.

911
00:52:23.208 --> 00:52:27.011
Let my family go and you can
do whatever you want with me.

912
00:52:29.079 --> 00:52:31.216
And I'll do something for you.

913
00:52:31.216 --> 00:52:32.817
- And what's that?

914
00:52:32.817 --> 00:52:34.619
- I'll kill you quick.

915
00:52:34.619 --> 00:52:37.422
(Bodil laughing)

916
00:52:37.422 --> 00:52:39.590
- You are amusing.

917
00:52:40.458 --> 00:52:42.493
- No pain. I promise you.

918
00:52:43.661 --> 00:52:47.465
- That is tempting but
Finnr would not approve.

919
00:52:47.465 --> 00:52:49.133
- Finnr?

920
00:52:49.133 --> 00:52:51.336
How does it feel
to be second fill

921
00:52:51.336 --> 00:52:53.871
to a little temper tantrum?

922
00:52:53.871 --> 00:52:55.573
You're what. three
years younger?

923
00:52:55.573 --> 00:52:57.608
And he gets the
keys to the kingdom.

924
00:52:57.608 --> 00:53:00.177
Surely you have some
say in this madness.

925
00:53:00.177 --> 00:53:02.880
- I will not let you
get inside my head.

926
00:53:03.648 --> 00:53:05.350
I love my brother

927
00:53:06.484 --> 00:53:11.389
and I love this. what
you call. madness.

928
00:53:12.323 --> 00:53:13.524
(laughing)

929
00:53:13.524 --> 00:53:14.459
- If you're sure.

930
00:53:15.793 --> 00:53:17.395
Have you ever seen a monkey?

931
00:53:20.164 --> 00:53:21.466
- I have not.

932
00:53:21.466 --> 00:53:22.767
- Amazing creatures.

933
00:53:23.868 --> 00:53:26.804
Like little tiny furry people.

934
00:53:26.804 --> 00:53:30.140
Me and my brother saw them
during the wars in the far East.

935
00:53:31.276 --> 00:53:33.878
You make a gesture
and they copy you.

936
00:53:33.878 --> 00:53:35.913
- What is your point?

937
00:53:35.913 --> 00:53:40.084
- My point is you
copy your brother.

938
00:53:40.084 --> 00:53:41.452
you're the monkey.

939
00:53:41.452 --> 00:53:43.087
- Shut up.

940
00:53:43.087 --> 00:53:44.722
- Stand up and be a man.

941
00:53:50.561 --> 00:53:51.629
Take me.

942
00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:53.431
Let them go.

943
00:53:57.502 --> 00:54:00.271
(dramatic music)

944
00:54:28.466 --> 00:54:30.134
- I'm taking part in the games.

945
00:54:31.268 --> 00:54:34.271
- Mother. you are a woman.

946
00:54:34.271 --> 00:54:35.172
- I am.

947
00:54:36.774 --> 00:54:39.977
So that's why two shitting.
screaming balls of joy

948
00:54:39.977 --> 00:54:42.480
fell out of my body
all those years ago.

949
00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:44.048
- You know what I mean.

950
00:54:44.048 --> 00:54:45.483
Father's changed the rule

951
00:54:45.483 --> 00:54:48.386
to see more variety of
gritting down for our cause.

952
00:54:48.386 --> 00:54:51.322
not for his own woman
to get vanquished.

953
00:54:51.322 --> 00:54:54.024
- And how is that fair to me?

954
00:54:54.024 --> 00:54:55.292
- It isn't.

955
00:54:55.292 --> 00:54:57.562
For you must be paid.

956
00:54:57.562 --> 00:54:59.597
- Doesn't our faith
encourage bloodshed

957
00:54:59.597 --> 00:55:00.798
from all who follow it?

958
00:55:00.798 --> 00:55:03.801
- I'm not saying you're
not capable. Mother.

959
00:55:03.801 --> 00:55:06.437
I'm just saying it's
not worth the risk.

960
00:55:08.038 --> 00:55:09.374
- What risk?

961
00:55:09.374 --> 00:55:11.976
Against some dainty
soft-hand whore?

962
00:55:12.777 --> 00:55:14.078
I fight.

963
00:55:15.045 --> 00:55:17.782
(gentle music)

964
00:55:35.633 --> 00:55:37.768
- Mother will
compete in the games.

965
00:55:37.768 --> 00:55:39.737
She deserve to feed her thirst.

966
00:55:39.737 --> 00:55:41.138
- This is very last minute.

967
00:55:42.206 --> 00:55:44.975
- No. it was always
going to happen.

968
00:55:44.975 --> 00:55:46.877
It's just now I'm telling you.

969
00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:51.348
- I respectfully disagree.

970
00:55:51.348 --> 00:55:52.883
- You what?

971
00:55:52.883 --> 00:55:55.986
- I am my father's son
and I will have my say.

972
00:55:57.087 --> 00:55:59.424
This clan would fall
apart without you.

973
00:56:00.525 --> 00:56:02.727
- It will be without
me one day anyway.

974
00:56:04.395 --> 00:56:05.963
- It's an unacceptable risk.

975
00:56:07.798 --> 00:56:09.634
What. just because I'm
a few some years younger

976
00:56:09.634 --> 00:56:11.602
means I don't get my say?

977
00:56:11.602 --> 00:56:16.140
- Oh sweet Bodil. of
course you get a say

978
00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:18.142
and I've heard you.

979
00:56:18.142 --> 00:56:20.878
And your concern
means a great deal.

980
00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:24.314
But it's two votes against one.

981
00:56:27.251 --> 00:56:30.354
Ander's whore. the
mother. she's mine.

982
00:56:32.423 --> 00:56:35.325
(dramatic music)

983
00:56:40.297 --> 00:56:45.369
- Never question me and
never question Mother again.

984
00:56:46.036 --> 00:56:46.704
Do you understand?

985
00:56:46.704 --> 00:56:48.305
(dramatic music)

986
00:56:48.305 --> 00:56:49.740
Good.

987
00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:52.643
(dramatic music)

988
00:57:15.933 --> 00:57:19.136
- Father. when these
morons bound me.

989
00:57:20.004 --> 00:57:21.672
I managed to tense my wrists.

990
00:57:22.707 --> 00:57:24.174
It gave me a little
bit of slack.

991
00:57:31.415 --> 00:57:36.086
And now I think I'm
just about free.

992
00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:40.691
- Now your sister.

993
00:57:42.059 --> 00:57:44.529
- South of here is
a harbor with boats.

994
00:57:44.529 --> 00:57:45.462
- They took our coin.

995
00:57:45.462 --> 00:57:46.997
- I'll think of something.

996
00:57:46.997 --> 00:57:50.100
(dramatic music)

997
00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:52.469
We sail. destination anywhere.

998
00:57:55.005 --> 00:57:56.273
- The guard's coming.

999
00:57:56.273 --> 00:57:57.975
Go. go. go. go.

1000
00:57:57.975 --> 00:57:59.109
- You too. go.

1001
00:57:59.109 --> 00:58:00.878
Take her and then go.

1002
00:58:00.878 --> 00:58:02.547
- There's no time.

1003
00:58:02.547 --> 00:58:05.382
(dramatic music)

1004
00:58:05.382 --> 00:58:06.884
- Where?

1005
00:58:06.884 --> 00:58:11.155
- On the way. there's an inn
with a green thatch roof. go.

1006
00:58:11.155 --> 00:58:12.690
- Oy.

1007
00:58:12.690 --> 00:58:14.258
- Go. go.

1008
00:58:14.258 --> 00:58:15.860
- Go.

1009
00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:18.663
(dramatic music)

1010
00:58:32.376 --> 00:58:35.045
(both gasping)

1011
00:58:42.186 --> 00:58:43.688
Quick. hide.

1012
00:58:43.688 --> 00:58:44.521
- No. no. no. no. no.

1013
00:58:44.521 --> 00:58:46.123
- Just there. trust me.

1014
00:58:46.123 --> 00:58:48.325
Trust in your brother.

1015
00:58:48.325 --> 00:58:51.228
(dramatic music)

1016
00:58:57.434 --> 00:58:59.103
- I can smell their fear.

1017
00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:02.506
- So you think you're
the wolf. Venres?

1018
00:59:02.506 --> 00:59:04.675
- I'm telling you I
can smell their fear.

1019
00:59:04.675 --> 00:59:05.843
- Then you're a fool.

1020
00:59:07.077 --> 00:59:08.646
They went that way.

1021
00:59:08.646 --> 00:59:10.948
- I'm telling you.
the girls over here.

1022
00:59:10.948 --> 00:59:16.020
I can smell her.

1023
00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:19.957
- I can hear you. boy.

1024
00:59:19.957 --> 00:59:21.792
- I am no boy.

1025
00:59:21.792 --> 00:59:23.427
I think last time proved that.

1026
00:59:24.962 --> 00:59:26.330
- You want a rematch.

1027
00:59:27.732 --> 00:59:30.400
- I wouldn't expect a savage
like you to fight fair.

1028
00:59:32.469 --> 00:59:34.138
- I don't need this to beat you.

1029
00:59:35.405 --> 00:59:38.242
(dramatic music)

1030
00:59:39.543 --> 00:59:42.913
(both moaning)

1031
00:59:42.913 --> 00:59:45.750
(dramatic music)

1032
00:59:48.018 --> 00:59:50.655
(both moaning)

1033
00:59:52.356 --> 00:59:55.159
(dramatic music)

1034
00:59:59.229 --> 01:00:01.899
(both moaning)

1035
01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:09.273
(dramatic music)

1036
01:00:11.976 --> 01:00:12.877
- Hilda.

1037
01:00:16.146 --> 01:00:18.883
(both moaning)

1038
01:00:26.724 --> 01:00:28.125
- Oh no. I've gotta
leave you alive. boy.

1039
01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:34.431
Lucky you.

1040
01:00:41.371 --> 01:00:43.573
(dramatic music)

1041
01:00:43.573 --> 01:00:44.408
(Hilda screaming)

1042
01:00:44.408 --> 01:00:47.544
- Shh. hush girly.

1043
01:00:48.679 --> 01:00:49.646
Remember me?

1044
01:00:50.815 --> 01:00:53.884
You have plenty of
time to scream later.

1045
01:00:53.884 --> 01:00:55.920
We missed you. you know.

1046
01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.723
(dramatic music)

1047
01:01:12.402 --> 01:01:13.804
- No.

1048
01:01:13.804 --> 01:01:15.472
- There you go. boy.

1049
01:01:15.472 --> 01:01:18.075
Mommy and daddy have missed you.

1050
01:01:18.075 --> 01:01:19.777
He's a good scrapper.

1051
01:01:19.777 --> 01:01:20.911
Thorvald was lucky.

1052
01:01:22.212 --> 01:01:25.482
- Ah. Mother. I wasn't expecting
to see you again so soon.

1053
01:01:25.482 --> 01:01:26.817
- Your sister?

1054
01:01:26.817 --> 01:01:28.418
- I dunno.

1055
01:01:28.418 --> 01:01:29.419
She kept going.

1056
01:01:30.387 --> 01:01:31.588
I think she's fine.

1057
01:01:31.588 --> 01:01:33.090
- Oh. pray to the Old Father.

1058
01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:36.293
- Pray to Estrid. she
wants a word with you.

1059
01:01:40.865 --> 01:01:42.499
(dramatic music)

1060
01:01:42.499 --> 01:01:45.502
(fire crackling)

1061
01:01:45.502 --> 01:01:48.839
(dramatic music)

1062
01:01:48.839 --> 01:01:52.209
(fire crackling)

1063
01:01:52.209 --> 01:01:55.012
(dramatic music)

1064
01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:01.451
- You're like my
husband in some ways.

1065
01:02:02.452 --> 01:02:04.154
a powerful animal.

1066
01:02:04.154 --> 01:02:06.123
- I'm nothing like him.

1067
01:02:06.123 --> 01:02:07.524
- You don't have his honor.

1068
01:02:09.126 --> 01:02:10.527
You act all high and mighty

1069
01:02:10.527 --> 01:02:13.730
but we know different. don't we?

1070
01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:16.133
(fire crackling)

1071
01:02:16.133 --> 01:02:17.267
- I did nothing to you.

1072
01:02:17.267 --> 01:02:18.168
- That's right.

1073
01:02:19.503 --> 01:02:21.972
You did nothing.

1074
01:02:21.972 --> 01:02:24.875
(fire crackling)

1075
01:02:26.276 --> 01:02:27.945
- I'm sorry.

1076
01:02:27.945 --> 01:02:30.114
- For what?

1077
01:02:31.215 --> 01:02:33.550
- I'm sorry I didn't stop him.

1078
01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:35.219
(fire crackling)

1079
01:02:35.219 --> 01:02:37.054
- Vikings will be
Vikings. right?

1080
01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:40.257
Does your wife know

1081
01:02:41.625 --> 01:02:44.561
why Amleth hated Ander.
the coward. so very much?

1082
01:02:46.396 --> 01:02:49.566
I'm surprised you told her
anything about the wars.

1083
01:02:49.566 --> 01:02:52.269
- When Olga found us.
she had a right to know.

1084
01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:55.973
- The Viking way.
rape and pillage.

1085
01:02:55.973 --> 01:02:57.274
- I didn't.

1086
01:02:57.274 --> 01:02:59.143
- You didn't stop
them. Amleth did.

1087
01:03:02.146 --> 01:03:05.850
You took my village.
burned it to the ground.

1088
01:03:05.850 --> 01:03:08.652
- Amleth played his part.

1089
01:03:08.652 --> 01:03:10.454
- But he would never hurt me.

1090
01:03:11.856 --> 01:03:16.693
You stood there
watching. doing nothing.

1091
01:03:16.693 --> 01:03:18.228
- I wasn't this man then.

1092
01:03:18.228 --> 01:03:21.498
I was barely even more
than a child myself.

1093
01:03:22.833 --> 01:03:25.836
- You were holding your
god's given rage inside

1094
01:03:25.836 --> 01:03:27.104
while three of your comrades

1095
01:03:27.104 --> 01:03:30.307
violated this little
girl over and over.

1096
01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:34.644
- There was nothing I could do.

1097
01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:35.545
- Liar.

1098
01:03:36.746 --> 01:03:38.115
Coward liar.

1099
01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:43.153
Do you imagine your little
girl in my position?

1100
01:03:43.153 --> 01:03:44.488
(fire crackling)

1101
01:03:44.488 --> 01:03:46.756
- Every time I remember it.

1102
01:03:49.426 --> 01:03:51.428
if I had touched 'em

1103
01:03:52.963 --> 01:03:55.032
it would've been treason.

1104
01:03:55.032 --> 01:03:56.833
I had a bride in waiting.

1105
01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:58.402
we were going to have a family.

1106
01:03:59.303 --> 01:04:01.171
- I had a family.

1107
01:04:01.171 --> 01:04:04.074
(fire crackling)

1108
01:04:04.074 --> 01:04:07.677
You could do nothing.
but Amleth did.

1109
01:04:08.979 --> 01:04:13.984
My love. my hero. my beautiful
dirty teenage Berserker.

1110
01:04:15.319 --> 01:04:18.422
cut them down as you
watched. frozen in fear.

1111
01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:23.827
- I remember his eyes

1112
01:04:23.827 --> 01:04:26.463
cutting through me
like burning arrows.

1113
01:04:27.864 --> 01:04:30.067
(fire crackling)

1114
01:04:30.067 --> 01:04:31.936
I remember my hand on my hip.

1115
01:04:34.138 --> 01:04:39.076
And I wondered if I even had
the right to defend myself.

1116
01:04:40.644 --> 01:04:42.612
- But he made no move to you.

1117
01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:47.684
- The Berserker just stared
as he carried you away.

1118
01:04:48.085 --> 01:04:48.919
And.

1119
01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.289
- And?

1120
01:04:52.289 --> 01:04:54.091
(fire crackling)

1121
01:04:54.091 --> 01:04:58.595
- And I reported him for
insubordination and desertion.

1122
01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:04.301
- No matter.

1123
01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:08.272
He was done with your
petty wars anyway.

1124
01:05:08.272 --> 01:05:10.140
ready for his own wars.

1125
01:05:11.408 --> 01:05:14.544
And soon I had a new family.

1126
01:05:15.845 --> 01:05:19.716
And the promise that one
day. when the time was right.

1127
01:05:19.716 --> 01:05:23.253
my love would destroy you
and everything you loved.

1128
01:05:24.588 --> 01:05:25.789
- Please.

1129
01:05:25.789 --> 01:05:27.257
I beg you Estrid.

1130
01:05:28.092 --> 01:05:30.027
(fire crackling)

1131
01:05:30.027 --> 01:05:34.264
- Now that promise
comes to pass. finally.

1132
01:05:35.632 --> 01:05:38.135
Soon the animal spirits will
reward us beyond measure.

1133
01:05:39.136 --> 01:05:42.039
(fire crackling)

1134
01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:45.809
Now my son will have
a word with you.

1135
01:05:47.144 --> 01:05:49.746
In a strange way. I thank
you for his existence.

1136
01:05:49.746 --> 01:05:50.647
(fire crackling)

1137
01:05:50.647 --> 01:05:51.581
- He knows?

1138
01:05:51.581 --> 01:05:53.083
- Of course.

1139
01:05:53.083 --> 01:05:56.086
Unlike you. I don't keep
secrets from my children.

1140
01:05:56.086 --> 01:05:57.287
(dramatic music)

1141
01:05:57.287 --> 01:05:59.556
(fire crackling)

1142
01:05:59.556 --> 01:06:02.392
(dramatic music)

1143
01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:35.559
- The man who took my father

1144
01:06:36.793 --> 01:06:38.862
and ignored the
lamentation of my mother.

1145
01:06:40.097 --> 01:06:42.166
- If it's guilt you
want me to feel.

1146
01:06:43.733 --> 01:06:47.104
I've already felt
a life's worth.

1147
01:06:48.238 --> 01:06:50.074
- Oh poor you.

1148
01:06:52.742 --> 01:06:55.679
- I tried so hard to make amends

1149
01:06:55.679 --> 01:06:58.448
with all horrors of
the past. of war.

1150
01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:03.487
I tried to tell your father
this but he wouldn't listen.

1151
01:07:03.487 --> 01:07:05.289
But you can.

1152
01:07:05.289 --> 01:07:09.193
- You'd have me deny
my father's wishes.

1153
01:07:09.193 --> 01:07:11.228
his own noble religion?

1154
01:07:13.697 --> 01:07:17.201
- Any nobility
your religion had.

1155
01:07:17.201 --> 01:07:21.605
Amleth and his followers
perverted it into a blood cult.

1156
01:07:21.605 --> 01:07:24.007
- Pig shit. after pig shit.

1157
01:07:25.509 --> 01:07:27.444
It's sad because we both know

1158
01:07:27.444 --> 01:07:30.914
that in another life
you'd be one of us.

1159
01:07:35.185 --> 01:07:36.353
- Maybe you are right.

1160
01:07:37.921 --> 01:07:39.856
Maybe I am like your father.

1161
01:07:41.991 --> 01:07:43.293
But in reverse.

1162
01:07:45.229 --> 01:07:46.263
- What do you mean?

1163
01:07:47.297 --> 01:07:50.033
- I tried to become
a better man.

1164
01:07:51.101 --> 01:07:55.439
But as he willingly
became worse.

1165
01:07:55.439 --> 01:07:59.976
any goodness left in him. he
squeezed 'til it was dead.

1166
01:08:00.844 --> 01:08:03.480
- My father was a pioneer.

1167
01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:06.816
He soared with the birds even
before his spirit joined them.

1168
01:08:07.617 --> 01:08:08.918
before you took him.

1169
01:08:11.688 --> 01:08:13.690
- I feel your pain. Finnr.

1170
01:08:15.159 --> 01:08:20.230
But can't you see all this
just causes more and more pain.

1171
01:08:21.331 --> 01:08:23.367
- I merely follow
the god's will.

1172
01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:26.903
- Amleth's will.

1173
01:08:26.903 --> 01:08:28.572
- Same thing.

1174
01:08:29.706 --> 01:08:32.576
The sacrifices you and
your kin will provide.

1175
01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:34.711
Why my god's will.

1176
01:08:34.711 --> 01:08:36.680
- Ah. your gods are a myth.

1177
01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:37.581
- Blasphemy.

1178
01:08:41.050 --> 01:08:43.553
- Perhaps my gods
are also a myth.

1179
01:08:44.921 --> 01:08:47.557
Old one idol enough for far.

1180
01:08:48.825 --> 01:08:52.196
Maybe all there is. is us.

1181
01:08:53.497 --> 01:08:56.633
humans. people.

1182
01:08:58.902 --> 01:09:00.270
- Oh my.

1183
01:09:00.270 --> 01:09:02.906
you'll even stoop to
your own idea of heresy.

1184
01:09:05.275 --> 01:09:09.379
I feel great joy seeing
you watching your children

1185
01:09:09.379 --> 01:09:10.280
bleed and beg.

1186
01:09:13.383 --> 01:09:16.019
(laughing)

1187
01:09:16.019 --> 01:09:17.086
There he is.

1188
01:09:17.887 --> 01:09:19.856
just the taste. but there he is.

1189
01:09:19.856 --> 01:09:21.925
You know why my father
really hated you?

1190
01:09:22.726 --> 01:09:24.494
The rage.

1191
01:09:24.494 --> 01:09:26.830
He saw it in you
on the battlefield.

1192
01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:27.997
Like a true Berserker.

1193
01:09:29.533 --> 01:09:31.034
It's not that you
didn't save my mother.

1194
01:09:31.034 --> 01:09:32.636
it's that you could have.

1195
01:09:32.636 --> 01:09:34.504
if you only embraced the rage.

1196
01:09:35.939 --> 01:09:40.844
But you deny it. and that's
what makes your coward.

1197
01:09:40.844 --> 01:09:43.913
(dramatic music)

1198
01:09:43.913 --> 01:09:45.849
Perhaps you'll do
well to think on this.

1199
01:09:45.849 --> 01:09:47.784
as you prepare for battle.

1200
01:09:47.784 --> 01:09:50.153
I'll see you on the battlefield.

1201
01:09:50.153 --> 01:09:52.989
(dramatic music)

1202
01:10:06.903 --> 01:10:09.539
(both moaning)

1203
01:10:11.875 --> 01:10:14.678
(dramatic music)

1204
01:10:16.813 --> 01:10:19.449
(both moaning)

1205
01:10:25.088 --> 01:10:28.658
(dramatic music)

1206
01:10:28.658 --> 01:10:31.395
(both moaning)

1207
01:10:34.464 --> 01:10:35.365
- Enough.

1208
01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:39.202
(dramatic music)

1209
01:10:42.672 --> 01:10:45.475
- Remaining brothers. leaders.

1210
01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:48.378
this is not the
turnout Amleth wanted.

1211
01:10:49.879 --> 01:10:54.518
but his spirit flies over us
watching. enjoying this day.

1212
01:10:55.519 --> 01:10:57.287
These prisoners try to run

1213
01:10:57.287 --> 01:10:59.856
and our brothers will shoot
them down in the woods.

1214
01:10:59.856 --> 01:11:00.857
with the arrows.

1215
01:11:01.691 --> 01:11:03.293
(dramatic music)

1216
01:11:03.293 --> 01:11:05.128
(birds chirping)

1217
01:11:05.128 --> 01:11:08.031
(dramatic music)

1218
01:11:12.636 --> 01:11:14.203
- Did they do anything to you?

1219
01:11:16.406 --> 01:11:18.342
- What are we going to do?

1220
01:11:20.377 --> 01:11:21.578
- We fight.

1221
01:11:21.578 --> 01:11:24.213
(dramatic music)

1222
01:11:24.213 --> 01:11:26.883
We fight and we win.

1223
01:11:26.883 --> 01:11:29.786
(dramatic music)

1224
01:11:36.092 --> 01:11:37.827
- Here we are. Olga.

1225
01:11:39.763 --> 01:11:42.198
I look forward to
tearing you apart.

1226
01:11:42.198 --> 01:11:44.100
- Shut up bitch and
get ready to die.

1227
01:11:45.201 --> 01:11:46.002
- We shall see.

1228
01:11:47.103 --> 01:11:50.073
(upbeat music)

1229
01:11:50.073 --> 01:11:53.176
(all cheering)

1230
01:11:53.176 --> 01:11:55.812
(upbeat music)

1231
01:11:58.147 --> 01:12:00.750
(all cheering)

1232
01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:03.487
(upbeat music)

1233
01:12:07.491 --> 01:12:09.993
(both moaning)

1234
01:12:09.993 --> 01:12:13.463
(swords clanging)

1235
01:12:13.463 --> 01:12:15.599
(upbeat music)

1236
01:12:15.599 --> 01:12:18.001
(all cheering)

1237
01:12:18.001 --> 01:12:20.637
(upbeat music)

1238
01:12:27.444 --> 01:12:29.245
(all cheering)

1239
01:12:29.245 --> 01:12:30.714
(birds chirping)

1240
01:12:30.714 --> 01:12:31.615
- Mother.

1241
01:12:32.549 --> 01:12:35.385
(dramatic music)

1242
01:12:36.252 --> 01:12:37.153
Finnr.

1243
01:12:38.121 --> 01:12:39.355
Mother.

1244
01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:43.126
- Shh. show some spine
in front of your people.

1245
01:12:43.126 --> 01:12:44.661
- Mother. wait.

1246
01:12:44.661 --> 01:12:46.162
(gentle music)

1247
01:12:46.162 --> 01:12:46.996
But.

1248
01:12:46.996 --> 01:12:48.231
- This is the games.

1249
01:12:48.231 --> 01:12:51.067
This is what our parents want.

1250
01:12:51.067 --> 01:12:51.968
You understand?

1251
01:12:53.002 --> 01:12:55.705
(gentle music)

1252
01:12:57.941 --> 01:12:58.942
- Thank you.

1253
01:12:58.942 --> 01:13:01.511
(gentle music)

1254
01:13:03.146 --> 01:13:05.982
(birds chirping)

1255
01:13:05.982 --> 01:13:08.718
(gentle music)

1256
01:13:10.153 --> 01:13:11.988
- They're together now. forever.

1257
01:13:13.122 --> 01:13:16.025
(dramatic music)

1258
01:13:22.699 --> 01:13:25.602
- Isn't this where you beg
for mercy like your father?

1259
01:13:25.602 --> 01:13:28.171
"I don't want to
die. I want peace."

1260
01:13:28.171 --> 01:13:31.374
- No. I was hoping to
finish off your brother.

1261
01:13:31.374 --> 01:13:32.842
But I guess I will have to deal

1262
01:13:32.842 --> 01:13:35.244
with the runt of the
litter instead. huh?

1263
01:13:37.013 --> 01:13:39.849
(dramatic music)

1264
01:13:45.855 --> 01:13:48.492
(all cheering)

1265
01:13:50.059 --> 01:13:52.862
(dramatic music)

1266
01:13:54.998 --> 01:13:57.567
(all cheering)

1267
01:13:57.567 --> 01:14:00.136
(swords clanging)

1268
01:14:00.136 --> 01:14:02.906
(dramatic music)

1269
01:14:05.108 --> 01:14:06.710
(both moaning)

1270
01:14:06.710 --> 01:14:08.845
(dramatic music)

1271
01:14:08.845 --> 01:14:11.648

thinks your pathetic for this.

1314
01:16:11.701 --> 01:16:14.370
Even they wouldn't
consider this sport.

1315
01:16:14.370 --> 01:16:17.306
- There are no way classes
in the games. Ander.

1316
01:16:18.307 --> 01:16:20.877
This is an equal
opportunity blood sport.

1317
01:16:20.877 --> 01:16:23.980
- How is this equal?

01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:26.449
(dramatic music)

1319
01:16:26.449 --> 01:16:28.752
- You believe they're
watching you. don't you?

1320
01:16:30.854 --> 01:16:31.755
Yes.

1321
01:16:33.256 --> 01:16:35.258
You believe. don't you?

1322
01:16:35.258 --> 01:16:36.693
Come on.

01:16:36.693 --> 01:16:37.927
You versus me.

01:16:39.528 --> 01:16:41.765
Now that would be a fair fight.

1325
01:16:41.765 --> 01:16:43.532
- Silence.

1326
01:16:43.532 --> 01:16:44.701

Are you a bear or

What do you say Finnr?

1331
01:16:53.109 --> 01:16:54.310
- Father. no. no. no. no. no.

1332
01:16:55.645 --> 01:16:59.683
- I've done done many things
in my life that are very wrong.

1333
01:16:59.683 --> 01:17:00.549
But this.

1334
01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:02.852
this is not one of them.

1335
01:17:02.852 --> 01:17:05.822
And I will tell you all
about them real soon.

1336
01:17:05.822 --> 01:17:07.390
- Please Father.

1337
01:17:07.390 --> 01:17:08.491
(gentle music)

1338
01:17:08.491 --> 01:17:10.727

(gentle music)

1340
01:17:13.396 --> 01:17:14.630
