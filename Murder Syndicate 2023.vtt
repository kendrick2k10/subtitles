- (scoffs) Jonah. Jonah!

11
00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.424
Put it away. sweetheart.

12
00:00:56.557 --> 00:00:58.359
- Nobody can see it.
- That's not the point.

13
00:00:58.492 --> 00:00:59.660
Just put it in the

14
00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:00.828

God. please tell me

18
00:01:09.036 --> 00:01:10.338
when I'm not around.

19
00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:12.740
- Oh. don't worry. I keep
these backseat bitches in line.

20
00:01:12.873 --> 00:01:15.109
- You know all about being
a backseat bitch. don't you?

21
00:01:15.243 --> 00:01:16.710
- (scoffs) Fuck you.

22

23
00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:23.984
It was a mistake
bringing all of you.

24
00:01:24.118 --> 00:01:26.554
I wish I just brought
Eddie or Duke instead.

25
00:01:26.687 --> 00:01:29.123
- Oh. no. we'll lock
it up. Mom. okay?

26
00:01:29.257 --> 00:01:30.658
Sorry.

27
00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:32.726
- [Isa] He's still
listenin' to something.

28
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.328
- That's how he preps.

29
00:01:34.462 --> 00:01:37.030
Let him listen to it.
it's not bothering you.

30
00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:39.733
- What did I just say?

31
00:01:41.235 --> 00:01:43.404
Take them out. Cain.

(Cain sighing)

33
00:01:46.574 --> 00:01:48.276
- So how many we expectin'?

34
00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:49.977
- [Isa] You really don't
listen to me. do you?

35
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.312
- I just did. didn't I?

36
00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:54.582
- 10. maybe more. that's
why I want us all there.

37
00:01:55.383 --> 00:01:57.385
- You should've brought
the M60 for this. Mom.

38
00:01:57.518 --> 00:01:59.220
Mow all the motherfuckers down.

39
00:01:59.353 --> 00:02:00.854
- Yeah. is that right?

40
00:02:00.988 --> 00:02:02.856
You gonna carry that
all by yourself?

41
00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:06.527
- If I couldn't. who
could. right. Cain?

42
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.796
- Get your fucking
hands off me. dickhole.

43
00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.964
- That's it. get out!

44
00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:13.667
You're driving me crazy
today. you know that. right?

45
00:02:13.801 --> 00:02:14.535
- [Becca] What about the job?

46
00:02:14.668 --> 00:02:15.603
They already paid half up front.

47
00:02:15.736 --> 00:02:16.604
- What the hell do I care?

48
00:02:16.737 --> 00:02:17.905
I'll give the money back.

49
00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:20.508
Because what I'm
looking at right now.

50
00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:22.476
are my three kids who'd
rather act like idiots.

51
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.811
instead of trained
professionals.

52
00:02:23.944 --> 00:02:26.113
- One of them isn't acting.

53
00:02:26.247 --> 00:02:28.316
- I'm sorry. okay?

54
00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:30.684
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

55
00:02:30.818 --> 00:02:32.152
- I'm not.

56
00:02:32.286 --> 00:02:33.621
I'm just wonderin'. are these
guys gonna be armed. yeah?

57
00:02:33.754 --> 00:02:35.323
I mean. they're probably gonna
have a stash of some sort?

58
00:02:35.456 --> 00:02:37.725
- We went over this
at the house. yes.

59
00:02:37.858 --> 00:02:39.059
- All right. then.

60
00:02:39.193 --> 00:02:40.761
Won't you give Jonah the
M4. Becca can have the MP5.

61
00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:41.962
Ma. you rock what you rock.

62
00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:44.031
and we just sweep the
motherfuckers dry.

63
00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:46.800
How's that for being
focused. ladies?

64
00:02:47.935 --> 00:02:50.671

Roddy's gonna pick up
the car and torch it.

69
00:03:08.656 --> 00:03:11.024
and Zane's gonna meet us
down on 6th. questions?

70
00:03:11.158 --> 00:03:12.693
- How do we know which
car he's gonna be in?

71
00:03:12.826 --> 00:03:15.062
- (chuckles) You'll
know it's Zane.

72
00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:17.231
Okay. pop the trunk and suit up.

73
00:03:17.365 --> 00:03:19.233
I'm gonna do a
last minute casing.

74

- Are we doing
this or what. lady?

79
00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:44.858
- She never
disappoints. does she?

80
00:03:44.992 --> 00:03:46.860
- [Jonah] Fuck that
M60. you feel me?

81
00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:50.197
- She knows how to pack
it in. I'll give her that.

82
00:03:50.331 --> 00:03:52.300
- What was all that
directing bullshit

83
00:03:52.433 --> 00:03:53.601
you were saying to Mom?

84
00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:55.569
Trying to win some brownie
points or something?

85
00:03:55.703 --> 00:03:57.004
- Just trying to
help you two out.

86

164
00:09:19.259 --> 00:09:20.661
If this genius just showed

This has never happened to her.

169

- What. are you out
of your fuckin' mind?

170
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.205
- Have you noticed anything
over the past few days?

171
00:09:32.339 --> 00:09:34.541
You're the one spending all
the fucking time with her.

172
00:09:34.675 --> 00:09:36.109
- What the fuck does that mean?

173
00:09:36.243 --> 00:09:37.811

what it means. cougar hunter.

174
00:09:37.945 --> 00:09:40.748

00:09:41.882 --> 00:09:43.350
- All three of you little shits.

177
00:09:43.483 --> 00:09:44.117
you treat your mom
like she's some kinda

178
00:09:44.251 --> 00:09:46.053
personal cash vendor.

179
00:09:46.186 --> 00:09:47.287
- We earn our fuckin' keep.

180
00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.722
Why the fuck are you
still hangin' around?

181
00:09:48.856 --> 00:09:50.457
Oh. it better be fucking loaded.

182
00:09:52.726 --> 00:09:54.227
Don't fucking try me.
Zane. I don't need a reason

183
00:09:54.361 --> 00:09:55.495
to pull this fuckin' trigger.

184
00:09:58.331 --> 00:09:59.266
- I'm gonna remember this.

185
00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:01.134
- I hope you do.

186
00:10:01.268 --> 00:10:02.670
- Please stop fighting.

187
00:10:05.038 --> 00:10:06.473
- [Zane] What do
you want me to do?

188
00:10:08.141 --> 00:10:13.480
- Zane. Jesus. take us home.

189
00:10:16.583 --> 00:10:17.685
- You got it.

190
00:10:19.252 --> 00:10:21.722
(Isa crying)

191
00:10:26.259 --> 00:10:29.229
(object shuffling)

192
00:10:30.864 --> 00:10:33.533
(Becca sighing)

193
00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:40.774
(no audio)

194
00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:49.016
(clothes rustling)
(Becca slurping)

195
00:10:51.919 --> 00:10:54.621
(Caine sighing)

196
00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:00.193
- Get any sleep?

197
00:11:00.327 --> 00:11:03.831
(Becca sighing)

198
00:11:03.964 --> 00:11:05.733
I guess that makes two of us.

199
00:11:07.634 --> 00:11:10.137
- Did you come in
to see her at all?

200
00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.172
You that much of
a selfish prick?

201
00:11:17.978 --> 00:11:19.212
- Not that you'd believe me.

202
00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:22.883
but I don't like
seeing Mom like that.

203
00:11:25.719 --> 00:11:26.754
I don't think I've ever

204
00:11:26.887 --> 00:11:30.523
seen her like that.
it fucked with me.

205
00:11:32.993 --> 00:11:34.327
- Yeah. I haven't either.

206
00:11:35.228 --> 00:11:37.731
- When was the last time
she even had a cold?

207
00:11:37.865 --> 00:11:39.332
Nothing could knock
her out like that.

208
00:11:39.466 --> 00:11:42.002
That's what I don't get.

209
00:11:42.135 --> 00:11:46.239
- Yeah. I was thinking
the same thing.

210
00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:47.741
It doesn't make any sense.

211
00:11:53.313 --> 00:11:54.848
- It's just not her.

212
00:11:56.649 --> 00:11:58.385
She's done sweeps 10
times more intense

213
00:11:58.518 --> 00:11:59.586
than that and still made it home

214
00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:01.889
in time to cook our
ungrateful asses dinner.

215
00:12:04.324 --> 00:12:05.392
You remember that?

216
00:12:10.163 --> 00:12:12.599
- Jonah's practically been
by her side all night.

217
00:12:13.433 --> 00:12:15.235
He's always been a mama's boy.

218
00:12:15.368 --> 00:12:19.206
- Yeah. he's a good
kid. means well.

219
00:12:19.339 --> 00:12:21.074
Not like assholes like us.

220
00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:27.881
What about lover boy?

221
00:12:28.015 --> 00:12:29.582
- Oh. don't call him that.

222
00:12:29.716 --> 00:12:31.751
- He's such a rat fuck.

223
00:12:31.885 --> 00:12:34.687
- He only comes around when
it's sexually expedient.

224
00:12:34.822 --> 00:12:36.423
- Or financially.

225
00:12:36.556 --> 00:12:38.425
- What?

226
00:12:38.558 --> 00:12:39.893
- Nothing.

227
00:12:42.529 --> 00:12:43.430
- Thought you really wanted

228
00:12:43.563 --> 00:12:45.065
to do him in when
he was driving.

229
00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:50.203
- I did. you have no idea.

230
00:12:53.974 --> 00:12:56.910
- She's awake. and wants
to talk to all of us.

231
00:12:57.044 --> 00:12:58.245
- Let's go. that's good news.

232
00:12:58.378 --> 00:13:01.448
- No. She said all of us.

233
00:13:03.516 --> 00:13:05.485
- [Becca] I'll
call Zane as well.

234
00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:07.821
- Just tell him to
hurry his ass up.

235
00:13:07.955 --> 00:13:11.758
(ominous instrumental music)

236
00:13:14.727 --> 00:13:17.430
(ominous instrumental
music continues)

237
00:13:17.564 --> 00:13:19.299
- I can't explain this.

238
00:13:19.432 --> 00:13:21.568
It's not a heart
attack. not a stroke.

239
00:13:22.669 --> 00:13:23.703
I think we just gotta wait for

240
00:13:23.837 --> 00:13:25.038
the blood results to come back.

241
00:13:26.406 --> 00:13:28.341
In the meantime. get some rest.

242
00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:30.510
And then hit me up
if you need anything.

243
00:13:31.678 --> 00:13:34.614
- You're a rockstar. Kenny.
you always have been.

244
00:13:39.286 --> 00:13:42.089
- I've never seen anything
drop you like this before.

245
00:13:42.222 --> 00:13:43.924
and I'm gonna work my
ass off to figure out

246
00:13:44.057 --> 00:13:45.158
what it is.

247
00:13:45.292 --> 00:13:46.526
- Kenny. really. I could
get out of bed right now.

248
00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:48.028
I feel so much better.

249
00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:52.465
- Stop. I'm going to figure it
out so you can kick its ass.

250
00:13:52.599 --> 00:13:54.334
and then get back up. all right?

251
00:13:54.467 --> 00:13:56.369
- Yeah.
- Take of yourself. all right?

252
00:13:56.503 --> 00:13:57.837
- Thanks.

253
00:13:57.971 --> 00:13:59.439
- Thanks.
- All right.

254
00:14:04.644 --> 00:14:08.181
- I can't believe he
didn't find anything.

255
00:14:09.983 --> 00:14:12.152
- Regardless of what
Kenny finds out is wrong.

256
00:14:13.153 --> 00:14:16.456
I wanted you all here
because you're what's

257
00:14:16.589 --> 00:14:18.191
most important to me.

258
00:14:19.826 --> 00:14:22.195
I really thought I could
go on a few more years.

259
00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.265
but what happened. has
me rethinking everything.

260
00:14:25.398 --> 00:14:26.666
- Mom. it wasn't
even that serious-

261
00:14:26.799 --> 00:14:29.036
- Just let me finish.
- Shut up.

262
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:34.741
- I think it was
a sign. I'm out.

263
00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:36.176
- What do you mean you're out?

264
00:14:36.309 --> 00:14:37.978
You're gonna kick this and
you're gonna bounce back.

265
00:14:38.111 --> 00:14:39.412
You can't make a decision
like that after one day.

266
00:14:39.546 --> 00:14:41.014
- It hasn't been just one day.

267
00:14:41.148 --> 00:14:42.082
I've been talking
to Zane about this.

268
00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:43.683
- You had something
to do with this?

269
00:14:43.816 --> 00:14:46.886
- Cain. stop it.

270
00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:50.190
- Yeah. listen to your
little bro. and chill out.

271
00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.727
- Don't take this out on Zane.

272
00:14:55.628 --> 00:14:56.796
This was my decision.

273
00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:58.131
He was just someone
I could talk to.

274
00:14:58.265 --> 00:14:59.632
and bounce ideas off of.

275
00:14:59.766 --> 00:15:00.833
'Cause God knows none of you

276
00:15:00.968 --> 00:15:02.435
have been around
here much lately.

277
00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:06.073
- Mom. we can't
do it without you.

278
00:15:06.206 --> 00:15:08.775
You organize
literally everything.

279
00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.579
- Yeah. well. you know.
I'm more than willing

280
00:15:12.712 --> 00:15:16.416
to take the load off
while she gets better.

281
00:15:16.549 --> 00:15:17.951
- No. the fuck you will.

282
00:15:18.751 --> 00:15:20.653
- What did you say?
- You seem to have

283
00:15:20.787 --> 00:15:23.690
a hearing problem. why don't
I correct your ass. don't ya?

284
00:15:23.823 --> 00:15:25.792
- Okay. both of you just stop.

285
00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:27.627
This is how it's gonna go.

286
00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:32.399
I'm not picking you.
Cain. or any of you.

287
00:15:32.532 --> 00:15:34.234
I'm freezing everything.

288
00:15:34.367 --> 00:15:35.768
Clients owed are gonna
get their money back.

289
00:15:35.902 --> 00:15:37.404
and they'll have
to go elsewhere.

290
00:15:37.537 --> 00:15:39.139
And no hits are gonna be put in.

291
00:15:40.107 --> 00:15:44.611
And that bible stays
right next to me.

292
00:15:44.744 --> 00:15:48.448
- Honey. we stop now
we lose everything.

293
00:15:48.581 --> 00:15:50.483
- Well. maybe we
should lose everything.

294
00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:54.654
I know you all have enough
10 times over to get by.

295
00:15:54.787 --> 00:15:57.557
For some of you. it's just
recreational at this point.

296
00:15:59.326 --> 00:16:01.494
And judging from what
happened yesterday.

297
00:16:02.895 --> 00:16:04.831
you all screwed up in my book.

298
00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:05.732
- What are you talking about?

299
00:16:05.865 --> 00:16:06.666
- Don't even pretend to act like

300
00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:08.201
you don't know what happened.

301
00:16:08.335 --> 00:16:10.270
You showing up late
almost got us all killed.

302
00:16:10.403 --> 00:16:11.138
- Ma. I-

303
00:16:11.271 --> 00:16:12.272
- Oh. don't Ma me!

304
00:16:14.441 --> 00:16:16.843
I built this business up myself.

305
00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:18.578
You think your father helped?

306
00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:20.313
The man was weak.

307
00:16:20.447 --> 00:16:21.648
You know the story.

308
00:16:21.781 --> 00:16:22.682
- You're right.

309
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.118
Whatever you wanna
do. I'm okay with it.

310
00:16:25.252 --> 00:16:27.454
- Thank you.
- Me too. Mom.

311
00:16:27.587 --> 00:16:29.889
- Thanks. Cain?

312
00:16:35.262 --> 00:16:37.330
- And where the hell
did you go last night?

313
00:16:37.464 --> 00:16:38.465
- What?

314
00:16:38.598 --> 00:16:40.800
- Becca said you left?
- 'Cause you did.

315
00:16:40.933 --> 00:16:44.337
- I left to go outside with
my gun and stand guard.

316
00:16:44.471 --> 00:16:46.406
- You're a lying piece of shit.

317
00:16:53.146 --> 00:16:54.881
- I don't know who to believe.

318
00:16:56.516 --> 00:16:58.451
- Listen. listen. we
should talk about this.

319
00:16:58.585 --> 00:16:59.952
one-on-one. okay?

320
00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:05.458
Maybe you need to settle down.
so you can think clearly.

321
00:17:05.592 --> 00:17:07.394
- Okay. my mind is clear.

322
00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:09.996
This is how it's gonna
go. until I say different.

323
00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:11.564
- You hear that. lover boy?

324
00:17:11.698 --> 00:17:13.266
Looks like we won't be
seeing you around as often

325
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.101
as you'd like.

326
00:17:14.234 --> 00:17:17.370
- Cain. could you stop?

327
00:17:17.504 --> 00:17:18.738
- Don't worry about it.

328
00:17:20.207 --> 00:17:23.210
Let your big bro
process his feelings.

329
00:17:26.313 --> 00:17:27.414
Maybe you're right.

330
00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:32.051
Maybe we all just need to
take a break. calm down.

331
00:17:32.185 --> 00:17:34.421
and we can figure everything
out when we're clear.

332
00:17:36.323 --> 00:17:39.926
- Zane. I just need
you and everyone else

333
00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:42.028
to just cool it for awhile.

334
00:17:42.162 --> 00:17:44.431
No picking up side jobs
related to this either.

335
00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:46.966
We just have to go radio
silent and off the map.

336
00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.736
But after that. I am
gonna pick who leads.

337
00:17:49.869 --> 00:17:54.874
I promise. if it makes
you feel any better.

338
00:17:56.676 --> 00:18:00.580
they're in this room.
we all know that.

339
00:18:01.114 --> 00:18:04.050
- They? Cause I'm a he.

340
00:18:07.354 --> 00:18:09.956
(both moaning)

341
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:18.565
Feel better. baby.

342
00:18:21.534 --> 00:18:22.935
- Zane. Zane.
- Hm?

343
00:18:26.539 --> 00:18:30.677
- I'd love to. but I
can't. I've gotta get home.

344
00:18:34.247 --> 00:18:36.949
(door creaking)

345
00:18:39.352 --> 00:18:41.053
- Mom. what the fuck was that?

346
00:18:44.491 --> 00:18:46.259
- Stop pushing him away.

347
00:18:46.393 --> 00:18:48.695
You can't treat him like that.

348
00:18:48.828 --> 00:18:50.563
He's gone now. probably
because of you guys-

349
00:18:50.697 --> 00:18:51.664
- He's a piece of shit snake.

350
00:18:51.798 --> 00:18:52.799
- Okay. don't
start that with me.

351
00:18:52.932 --> 00:18:55.067
Our problem is because of you.

352
00:18:55.202 --> 00:18:56.936
So just stay out of my business.

353
00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.476
(Zane huffing)

354
00:19:06.112 --> 00:19:08.581
(hand pounding)

355
00:19:08.715 --> 00:19:12.118
(Zane huffing)

356
00:19:14.454 --> 00:19:16.989
(gun cocking)

357
00:19:21.428 --> 00:19:24.197
(feet pattering)

358
00:19:27.434 --> 00:19:29.836
- I think she'll be
quick with the next move.

359
00:19:29.969 --> 00:19:31.504
She doesn't sandbag anything.

360
00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:36.175
- Looks like I'm gonna be
seeing a lot more of you guys.

361
00:19:39.279 --> 00:19:41.147
It's always great
catching up. Jonah.

362
00:19:45.818 --> 00:19:49.722
Becca. good seeing you.
- Thanks.

363
00:19:52.592 --> 00:19:54.894
- Now the strong. silent type.

364
00:19:56.263 --> 00:19:57.997
Any parting words for me?

365
00:19:59.466 --> 00:20:01.568
'Cause I'm all ears.

366
00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:08.841
- Whatever you
were thinking. no.

367
00:20:11.378 --> 00:20:13.613
You were never
really good at it.

368
00:20:14.847 --> 00:20:17.417
Things didn't work out
between you and my mom. boo.

369
00:20:19.218 --> 00:20:20.387
You need to walk away.

370
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.289
- [Becca] Cain. I
think he gets it.

371
00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:28.395
- No. it's okay. I like to
hear you speak your mind.

372
00:20:28.528 --> 00:20:30.363
Reminds me that
he still has one.

373
00:20:31.831 --> 00:20:33.466
Besides. maybe you're right.

374
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.636
Maybe I didn't think this whole
thing all the way through.

375
00:20:38.905 --> 00:20:40.707
But that's the fun
sometimes. isn't it?

376
00:20:42.809 --> 00:20:47.580
- Know this. I don't
care what my mom says.

377
00:20:47.714 --> 00:20:49.749
I don't wanna see your
ass around here anymore.

378
00:20:51.518 --> 00:20:54.854
- You ain't just gonna see my
ass. you'll see my balls too.

379
00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:59.025
- Don't be surprised when I
shove it right back up your ass.

380
00:21:00.059 --> 00:21:02.261
- As long as you show
up on time. big boy.

381
00:21:02.395 --> 00:21:04.897
- Somebody's gotta be here
to take out the trash.

382
00:21:08.234 --> 00:21:09.736
- Take it easy. kid.

383
00:21:11.538 --> 00:21:12.905
You kiss your mom
with that mouth?

384
00:21:13.039 --> 00:21:15.542
- I guess you know
what it tastes like.

385
00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.315
- I don't like him either.

386
00:21:22.449 --> 00:21:24.351
but those stupid threats
aren't gonna phase him.

387
00:21:24.484 --> 00:21:26.218
He's gonna do whatever he wants.

388
00:21:26.353 --> 00:21:28.788
- Yeah. would you cool
it the fuck off. man.

389
00:21:28.921 --> 00:21:31.090
Both of you shit on
him way too much.

390
00:21:32.925 --> 00:21:34.661
He cares about her
like we all do.

391
00:21:35.428 --> 00:21:37.597
- You're really that
dumb. aren't you?

392
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:41.901
You two have fun.

393
00:21:45.605 --> 00:21:47.507
- Don't listen to him.

394
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.442
- We gotta watch those two.

395
00:21:49.576 --> 00:21:51.511
I'm telling you. for Mom's sake.

396
00:21:53.446 --> 00:21:54.481
- Cain respects Mom.

397
00:21:55.682 --> 00:21:58.250
And Zane. he's not gonna
try anything after all that.

398
00:21:59.318 --> 00:22:00.953
- I hope you're right.

399
00:22:06.192 --> 00:22:08.661
(feet pattering)

400
00:22:14.266 --> 00:22:16.636
(car beeping)

401
00:22:20.139 --> 00:22:24.477
- We have a problem.

402
00:22:24.611 --> 00:22:28.314
- With Isa?
- That bitch Cain?

403
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:32.018
- With everyone.

404
00:22:38.057 --> 00:22:41.428
(calm electronic music)

405
00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:51.704
(calm electronic
music continues)

406
00:22:56.242 --> 00:23:00.480
(calm electronic
music continues)

407
00:23:04.851 --> 00:23:09.556
(calm electronic
music continues)

408
00:23:09.689 --> 00:23:11.223
(calm electronic
music continues)

409
00:23:11.357 --> 00:23:12.391
- [Mickey] Whoo-wee!

410
00:23:13.826 --> 00:23:17.430
Girl. you look like
that J. Johansson.

411
00:23:17.564 --> 00:23:19.866
from the "Justice
League." the Widow.

412
00:23:19.999 --> 00:23:22.201
Come here. spin me in your web.

413
00:23:22.334 --> 00:23:24.804
Yo. what is happening. man?

414
00:23:24.937 --> 00:23:26.238
How you doing?

415
00:23:26.372 --> 00:23:28.941
- It's been awhile.
Mickey. what's going on?

416
00:23:29.075 --> 00:23:31.511
- You know. killing
motherfuckers

417
00:23:31.644 --> 00:23:33.780
for a living every single day.

418
00:23:37.684 --> 00:23:40.920
Hey. look. he's back here.
but can I get you anything?

419
00:23:41.053 --> 00:23:42.388
You know we got everything.

420
00:23:43.623 --> 00:23:45.558
- Nah. I'm good for now. man.

421
00:23:47.059 --> 00:23:47.927
- All right.

422
00:23:49.929 --> 00:23:52.264
Oh. I see you're
taking it all in.

423
00:23:52.398 --> 00:23:58.237
Yeah. Zane's been redecorating.
Upgrading. if you will.

424
00:23:58.905 --> 00:24:00.406
Murder money. baby.

425
00:24:02.341 --> 00:24:05.311
- Hey. look who
decided to show up.

426
00:24:05.444 --> 00:24:07.614
Where you been.
you goofy bastard?

427
00:24:08.781 --> 00:24:12.084
- Been busy taking
care of my mom.

428
00:24:12.218 --> 00:24:13.686
You guys should know that.

429
00:24:14.987 --> 00:24:18.290
- Yeah. look man. we're
sorry to hear about that.

430
00:24:18.424 --> 00:24:21.260
Your mom. though.
she's a tough broad.

431
00:24:21.393 --> 00:24:25.097
- Real tough. like bullets
bouncing off her tough.

432
00:24:25.231 --> 00:24:26.966
- Pew-Pew.

433
00:24:27.099 --> 00:24:29.468
- Then why haven't you
stopped by to see her?

434
00:24:29.602 --> 00:24:32.471
She got Zane in on this
and then you guys followed.

435
00:24:32.605 --> 00:24:35.575
You owe her everything.

436
00:24:35.708 --> 00:24:36.776
- Owe her?

437
00:24:37.744 --> 00:24:39.445
Look here. little man.

438
00:24:40.079 --> 00:24:44.350
I'll fucking kill you.
know where you're at.

439
00:24:45.618 --> 00:24:47.620
You come around here
again acting crazy.

440
00:24:47.754 --> 00:24:49.121
I'll fucking kill you.

441
00:24:49.255 --> 00:24:55.494
- Oh. oh. ain't a job.
ain't a job. okay?

442
00:24:56.062 --> 00:25:01.200
Chill. Look. we're family. okay?

443
00:25:01.768 --> 00:25:03.536
You hurt. we hurt.

444
00:25:04.336 --> 00:25:06.372
We're here to have a good time.

445
00:25:06.505 --> 00:25:08.274
Let's have a good time.

446
00:25:14.213 --> 00:25:16.816
- Look. Mickey. any other time.

447
00:25:16.949 --> 00:25:18.585
you know I wouldn't
be like this.

448
00:25:18.718 --> 00:25:19.986
But Zane called me over to talk.

449
00:25:20.119 --> 00:25:21.353
and I just wanna talk to him.

450
00:25:22.254 --> 00:25:23.990
My mind's on other
shit right now.

451
00:25:25.024 --> 00:25:26.726
Show me where he's at.

452
00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:28.427
- All right. all
right. follow me.

453
00:25:35.301 --> 00:25:37.236
Yeah. man. don't
worry about Franklin.

454
00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:39.806
His big. Dwayne
Johnson looking ass

455
00:25:39.939 --> 00:25:42.675
just mad he ain't getting
no coochie tonight.

456
00:25:43.643 --> 00:25:45.845
- [Jonah] Looks like
he's doing just fine.

457
00:25:45.978 --> 00:25:48.380
- Yeah. right until I
come scoop the bitch up.

458
00:25:54.053 --> 00:25:56.522
- Jonah. Jonah. Jonah.

459
00:25:56.656 --> 00:25:57.990
There you are.

460
00:25:58.124 --> 00:26:00.392
You've been avoiding us.

461
00:26:00.526 --> 00:26:01.628
- What are you talking about?

462
00:26:01.761 --> 00:26:03.429
- Yeah. why haven't
you been doing jobs

463
00:26:03.562 --> 00:26:05.431
with us anymore. huh?

464
00:26:05.564 --> 00:26:07.333
You problem?

465
00:26:07.466 --> 00:26:10.069
- Everyone knows you're the
best straight shooter around.

466
00:26:12.171 --> 00:26:14.206
- Thanks. Jonah.

467
00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:16.408
Looks like you won't be
needing this anymore.

468
00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.415
- Give me the fucking gun.

469
00:26:23.549 --> 00:26:28.020
- Ooh. sexy.

470
00:26:32.959 --> 00:26:36.729
- And it's heavy.
(girls laughing)

471
00:26:36.863 --> 00:26:39.131
- Yeah. this might
do some damage.

472
00:26:39.265 --> 00:26:42.769
- Don't be so nervous. handsome.

473
00:26:42.902 --> 00:26:45.304
- That's the smartest
thing you've ever done.

474
00:26:47.206 --> 00:26:52.578
- Yeah. just relax.
- We don't bite.

475
00:26:52.712 --> 00:26:55.982
- Unless you want us to.
(girls laughing)

476
00:26:57.049 --> 00:27:00.653
- Ladies. ladies.
let the man see Zane.

477
00:27:00.787 --> 00:27:04.423
(faint instrumental music)

478
00:27:08.094 --> 00:27:09.128
- If you were as good with a gun

479
00:27:09.261 --> 00:27:10.196
as you are with that little toy.

480
00:27:10.329 --> 00:27:11.931
maybe my mom could
have used you.

481
00:27:12.064 --> 00:27:14.133
- [Johnny] Oh. she did. you
should ask her about it.

482
00:27:14.266 --> 00:27:16.669
- Yo. chill.

483
00:27:16.803 --> 00:27:18.104
- You should fuck
off and walk away.

484
00:27:18.237 --> 00:27:21.040
- She loved my yo-yo.
- Oh. my God.

485
00:27:21.173 --> 00:27:22.474
- She showed me some
of her tricks too.

486
00:27:22.608 --> 00:27:24.043
- I'll show you
some fucking tricks.

487
00:27:25.144 --> 00:27:26.345
You're fucking lucky
you piece of shit!

488
00:27:26.478 --> 00:27:28.280
- [Franklin] You stay here.

489
00:27:29.581 --> 00:27:30.649
- I'll take him back.

490
00:27:30.783 --> 00:27:32.985
- Thank you. thank you.
- Come on. man.

491
00:27:36.455 --> 00:27:38.891
(Zane snorting)

492
00:27:41.828 --> 00:27:43.930
- Oh. Jonah. hey!

493
00:27:44.063 --> 00:27:45.031
Thanks for coming.

494
00:27:45.164 --> 00:27:46.966
- You wanted to talk to me?

495
00:27:47.099 --> 00:27:49.869
- Talk? (laughs)

496
00:27:50.002 --> 00:27:51.403
Hey. why didn't you
offer him something?

497
00:27:51.537 --> 00:27:52.204
What do you want. kid?

498
00:27:52.338 --> 00:27:53.305
We got everything.

499
00:27:53.439 --> 00:27:55.141
- He said he didn't
want nothing.

500
00:27:55.274 --> 00:27:57.609
- (laughs) What. are you
turning me down already?

501
00:27:57.744 --> 00:27:59.311
That's not like you.

502
00:27:59.445 --> 00:28:00.612
- Maybe I'm not in
a celebrating mood.

503
00:28:00.747 --> 00:28:02.849
unlike you assholes.

504
00:28:02.982 --> 00:28:05.251
You forget about what
happened to my mom?

505
00:28:05.384 --> 00:28:07.319
You're acting like
it's business as usual.

506
00:28:09.321 --> 00:28:10.589
I didn't come here to party.

507
00:28:11.457 --> 00:28:14.126
So spit it the fuck
out what you want.

508
00:28:16.695 --> 00:28:19.565
- Whoo.
- Whoo.

509
00:28:19.698 --> 00:28:22.902
- Looks like somebody
finally grew a pair of balls.

510
00:28:25.805 --> 00:28:28.841
- And they dropped
today. God damn.

511
00:28:28.975 --> 00:28:32.745
- Hey. Jonah. did I introduce
you to my little baby sister.

512
00:28:32.879 --> 00:28:34.180
here. Sonya?

513
00:28:35.247 --> 00:28:36.282
- We've met.

514
00:28:36.415 --> 00:28:37.716
How are you. sweetheart?

515
00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:40.086
- Yeah. we've met.

516
00:28:41.687 --> 00:28:43.689
- Please give your
mom my regards.

517
00:28:43.823 --> 00:28:47.559
We never really hung out
too much. but Zane raves

518
00:28:47.693 --> 00:28:48.360
about her.

519
00:28:48.494 --> 00:28:49.561
- Does he?

520
00:28:49.695 --> 00:28:51.898
Sure has a funny
way of showing it.

521
00:28:52.164 --> 00:28:55.301
- Come on now. we only
got room for one prick

522
00:28:55.434 --> 00:28:57.569
in this family.
- You mean you?

523
00:28:58.805 --> 00:29:01.240
- (laughs) I told you.
he's good. isn't he?

524
00:29:02.308 --> 00:29:05.444
No. I meant that fuck nuts
brother of yours. Cain.

525
00:29:06.745 --> 00:29:10.316
Besides. we're not family yet.

526
00:29:10.449 --> 00:29:12.451
Speaking of which.

527
00:29:12.584 --> 00:29:14.420
why don't you give me
and little fast-talker

528
00:29:14.553 --> 00:29:16.122
over here some privacy?

529
00:29:16.255 --> 00:29:17.556
We'll have a little chat.

530
00:29:25.297 --> 00:29:28.334
Hey. see this?

531
00:29:28.467 --> 00:29:30.803
I don't like drinking alone.
so don't make me drink alone.

532
00:29:30.937 --> 00:29:32.371
- Fuck it. I'm already here.

533
00:29:35.842 --> 00:29:38.077
- (laughs) And he's back.
ladies and gentlemen.

534
00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:39.578
just like that.

535
00:29:39.711 --> 00:29:42.114
I was getting so worried there
you were getting soft on me.

536
00:29:43.782 --> 00:29:45.117
- What do you expect. man?

537
00:29:45.517 --> 00:29:47.219
- (laughs) I'm just kidding!

538
00:29:51.757 --> 00:29:52.791
- You haven't visited my mom.

539
00:29:52.925 --> 00:29:54.493
ever since she put
everything on hold.

540
00:29:54.626 --> 00:29:55.694
- Hm.

541
00:29:56.929 --> 00:29:58.998
- My brother and sister
are barely talking to me.

542
00:29:59.131 --> 00:30:00.732
I feel like I'm the
only one trying to

543
00:30:00.867 --> 00:30:03.269
make peace with everybody.

544
00:30:04.603 --> 00:30:07.239
- Why do you think
I called you here?

545
00:30:07.373 --> 00:30:09.141
- Who the fuck knows?

546
00:30:09.275 --> 00:30:10.642
You tell me.

547
00:30:10.776 --> 00:30:19.451
- Well. the fact is you are
one trustworthy motherfucker.

548
00:30:19.585 --> 00:30:22.321
(glass tapping)

549
00:30:22.454 --> 00:30:23.689
you always have been.

550
00:30:24.991 --> 00:30:31.130
- Yeah. and it cost
me being alienated

551
00:30:31.263 --> 00:30:32.364
from the rest of my family.

552
00:30:32.498 --> 00:30:34.666
- That's not really
your fault. exactly.

553
00:30:35.601 --> 00:30:38.804
Granted. those shit head
siblings of yours really do

554
00:30:38.938 --> 00:30:41.640
not appreciate you.
but your mother?

555
00:30:43.209 --> 00:30:45.511
She cares about you
more than anything.

556
00:30:47.013 --> 00:30:48.547
She knows you've been
there for her every beat.

557
00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.983
Shit. since she's been sick
you've been spending more

558
00:30:51.117 --> 00:30:52.518
time with her than I have.

559
00:30:52.651 --> 00:30:55.321
You're making me look like
a bad boyfriend over here!

560
00:30:59.625 --> 00:31:01.727
- What do you want from me?

561
00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:03.562
- What do I want?

562
00:31:03.695 --> 00:31:07.466
I want you.

563
00:31:09.335 --> 00:31:12.071
You're mother trusts
you more than anybody.

564
00:31:12.204 --> 00:31:14.573
If you pin me to
be next in line.

565
00:31:16.042 --> 00:31:18.244
I'm gonna make sure
you're appreciated.

566
00:31:18.877 --> 00:31:22.881
- So all this shit
was a fucking pitch?

567
00:31:23.015 --> 00:31:24.850
What the fuck do you think I am?

568
00:31:24.984 --> 00:31:27.186
My mom said she'd
make a decision.

569
00:31:28.054 --> 00:31:31.890
- And she chooses those two
shit head siblings of yours.

570
00:31:32.024 --> 00:31:33.659
what does that say about you?

571
00:31:33.792 --> 00:31:35.461
You think they give
a fuck about you?

572
00:31:36.328 --> 00:31:38.597
All they wanna do is scold you.

573
00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:41.900
tell you what to do. (whines).

574
00:31:42.768 --> 00:31:43.936
And me?

575
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:47.373
When I'm the fucking
boss. no strings attached.

576
00:31:47.506 --> 00:31:49.241
you get anything you want.

577
00:31:49.375 --> 00:31:50.776
Teamwork.

578
00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:52.711
Quid pro quo. (speaks
in foreign language)?

579
00:31:57.016 --> 00:31:58.150
- I don't know. man.

580
00:32:01.687 --> 00:32:03.789
That's family we're
talking about.

581
00:32:03.922 --> 00:32:04.957
- Yeah. you're right.

582
00:32:05.091 --> 00:32:06.725
'Cause family is a
very special thing.

583
00:32:06.858 --> 00:32:08.094
it's a very fragile thing.

584
00:32:08.227 --> 00:32:08.894
You know why?

585
00:32:09.028 --> 00:32:10.362
'Cause it always changes.

586
00:32:10.496 --> 00:32:12.064
it's not always about blood.

587
00:32:12.198 --> 00:32:17.903
it's about protection. it's
about trust. you feel me?

588
00:32:19.038 --> 00:32:20.639
- I have to think about this.

589
00:32:22.441 --> 00:32:23.542
- Okay. okay. wait. wait. wait.

590
00:32:23.675 --> 00:32:27.746
You think. think very
hard. long and hard.

591
00:32:27.879 --> 00:32:35.754
But before you do that. there's
something I want us to do.

592
00:32:35.887 --> 00:32:40.292
(ominous instrumental music)

593
00:32:40.426 --> 00:32:42.294
Take a little ride.

594
00:32:42.728 --> 00:32:46.598
(laughs) You're gonna
love this. I promise.

595
00:32:48.134 --> 00:32:50.469
- You still haven't told
me where we're going.

596
00:32:51.103 --> 00:32:52.838
- Don't get all
serious on me now.

597
00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:54.673
Come on. it'll be a
quickie. it's gonna be fun.

598
00:32:54.806 --> 00:32:57.076
- You could at least
tell me what we're doing.

599
00:32:57.209 --> 00:32:58.477
- Look in the glove box.

600
00:33:01.347 --> 00:33:03.615
- Open up the glove box.

601
00:33:03.749 --> 00:33:05.217
- Why?

602
00:33:05.351 --> 00:33:08.154
- It's not gonna bite you.
just fucking open it up.

603
00:33:12.224 --> 00:33:13.825
- What. the gun?

604
00:33:14.793 --> 00:33:16.995
- Yeah. how does
it make you feel?

605
00:33:20.099 --> 00:33:21.400
- I have enough already.

606
00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:27.106
- Yeah. well you know a
gun is kinda like a cock.

607
00:33:27.239 --> 00:33:29.608
You don't take it out
unless you're gonna use it.

608
00:33:31.143 --> 00:33:33.145
- What do you want me to do?

609
00:33:33.279 --> 00:33:35.481
You know my mom
froze everything.

610
00:33:35.614 --> 00:33:38.217
We're not allowed to do
shit until she tells us to.

611
00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:41.353
- It has nothing to do with
that. it's its own thing.

612
00:33:41.487 --> 00:33:43.989
Only side gig.
there's no conflict.

613
00:33:52.298 --> 00:33:54.166
- Come on. man don't
be such a pussy.

614
00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:55.967
You can grab the gun.

615
00:33:56.502 --> 00:33:58.537
You're gonna have to
use it pretty soon.

616
00:34:01.707 --> 00:34:03.375
Fine. you know what then?

617
00:34:04.643 --> 00:34:07.779
You don't wanna grab the gun.
just grab under the seat.

618
00:34:07.913 --> 00:34:09.348
- Seriously?

619
00:34:09.481 --> 00:34:11.583
- Yeah. just grab under the
seat. I'm not fucking with you.

620
00:34:15.854 --> 00:34:17.456
- What the fuck is this?

621
00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:19.525
Cut the bullshit. what
are you trying to do?

622
00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.294
- It's 10K.

623
00:34:24.029 --> 00:34:26.198
It's half of what I'm
getting for this job.

624
00:34:26.332 --> 00:34:28.400
and it's all going to
you right fucking now.

625
00:34:29.535 --> 00:34:31.137
That's what I'm talking about.

626
00:34:32.971 --> 00:34:34.240
- What do I have to do?

627
00:34:34.873 --> 00:34:36.575
You know what. don't
even answer that.

628
00:34:36.708 --> 00:34:38.910
Just pull over and
I'll take an Uber back.

629
00:34:40.812 --> 00:34:42.881
Nobody gives anyone
a half gig's pay

630
00:34:43.014 --> 00:34:44.783
for not even setting
it up or anything.

631
00:34:44.916 --> 00:34:46.518
That's not how it works.

632
00:34:46.652 --> 00:34:47.886
- It does with us.

633
00:34:48.019 --> 00:34:49.054
Don't you get it?

634
00:34:49.188 --> 00:34:50.822
It's no more of this
backseat bullshit.

635
00:34:50.956 --> 00:34:53.559
This is teamwork I'm
talking about here.

636
00:34:53.692 --> 00:34:55.093
Come on.

637
00:34:55.227 --> 00:34:57.329
You take a gig. you
get paid for that gig.

638
00:34:57.463 --> 00:34:58.397
you get your fair share.

639
00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:00.232
That's what I'm talking about.

640
00:35:00.366 --> 00:35:01.467
You know what?

641
00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.270
Fuck it. I'll fucking
do the job myself. okay?

642
00:35:05.237 --> 00:35:07.373
Just be ready to rock
and roll when I come out.

643
00:35:07.506 --> 00:35:08.940
Take that money and
stuff it in your

644
00:35:09.074 --> 00:35:11.477
pants right now for
all I fucking care.

645
00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:13.812
It's like I said. we're
in this all or nothing.

646
00:35:13.945 --> 00:35:14.946
You know what I want.

647
00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.482
- Now I know you're
fucking with me.

648
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:20.152
- Well. maybe next time.

649
00:35:20.286 --> 00:35:22.488
you'll actually wanna go
inside. and get some action.

650
00:35:22.621 --> 00:35:25.023
Maybe next time.
I'll get you an M60

651
00:35:25.157 --> 00:35:26.625
like you've been dreaming about.

652
00:35:26.758 --> 00:35:28.260
Get some high end gigs.

653
00:35:34.266 --> 00:35:35.634
Just get in the driver's seat.

654
00:35:35.767 --> 00:35:42.441
Be ready to rock and
roll. okay. okay?

655
00:35:43.875 --> 00:35:44.976
- [Jonah] I know. man.

656
00:35:45.877 --> 00:35:47.413
- [Zane] Keep the engine warm.

657
00:35:53.352 --> 00:35:56.988
(intense electronic music)

658
00:36:02.027 --> 00:36:06.498
(intense electronic
music continues)

659
00:36:11.303 --> 00:36:13.339
- Come on. motherfucker.

660
00:36:16.141 --> 00:36:19.110
- [Zane] Did anybody
order a pizza?

661
00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:28.587
(intense electronic
music continues)

662
00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:33.759
(gun firing)
(Zane cheering)

663
00:36:36.662 --> 00:36:39.865
(Zane laughing)
- Whoo!

664
00:36:39.998 --> 00:36:42.568
- Go. go. go. go. go. go!

665
00:36:42.701 --> 00:36:45.036
(laughs) Whoo!

666
00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:46.705
See what we fucking did?

667
00:36:46.838 --> 00:36:48.707
We did that. yeah.

668
00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.642
- You gonna tell me where
the fuck to go or what?

669
00:36:50.776 --> 00:36:52.544
- Keep going straight.
keep going straight.

670
00:36:52.678 --> 00:36:53.412
Wait. no. no. no.

671
00:36:53.545 --> 00:36:54.680
Slow down. slow down. slow down.

672
00:36:54.813 --> 00:36:56.181
You don't wanna make
too much attention.

673
00:36:56.315 --> 00:36:58.016
You've done this before. right?

674
00:36:58.149 --> 00:36:59.451
All right. make a left.

675
00:37:03.021 --> 00:37:04.590
- [Jonah] How many you take out?

676
00:37:04.723 --> 00:37:07.259
- Enough. (laughs)

677
00:37:07.393 --> 00:37:10.061
You should've seen the looks
on their fucking faces.

678
00:37:10.195 --> 00:37:11.763
- I don't get all this.

679
00:37:11.897 --> 00:37:13.064
Who paid you to do this?

680
00:37:13.198 --> 00:37:14.900
- It's my own side
thing. all right?

681
00:37:15.033 --> 00:37:16.001
It has nothing to
do with your mom.

682
00:37:16.134 --> 00:37:16.902
Don't worry about it.

683
00:37:17.035 --> 00:37:18.404
This is between us.

684
00:37:19.905 --> 00:37:21.340
That's okay. isn't it?

685
00:37:21.473 --> 00:37:23.342
- I still don't get this.

686
00:37:23.475 --> 00:37:24.543
If you're getting
all these jobs.

687
00:37:24.676 --> 00:37:26.211
why does it even fucking matter

688
00:37:26.345 --> 00:37:28.780
that you have my mom's business?

689
00:37:28.914 --> 00:37:30.949
- Do you like how much
money you just made?

690
00:37:32.618 --> 00:37:35.787
Fuck this. smell this?

691
00:37:35.921 --> 00:37:37.456
I love the smell of that.

692
00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:38.390
You like that?

693
00:37:38.524 --> 00:37:40.359
- Yeah. it's a shitload.

694
00:37:40.492 --> 00:37:42.361
- Do you know who
won't give you this?

695
00:37:42.494 --> 00:37:45.731
Your fucking brother
and your sister.

696
00:37:45.864 --> 00:37:49.968
It's like I always say. family
is not just about blood.

697
00:37:51.202 --> 00:37:53.905
(Zane laughing)

698
00:37:55.607 --> 00:37:59.110
(Zane sniffing)

699
00:37:59.244 --> 00:38:02.013
Just go straight
and do another left.

700
00:38:04.316 --> 00:38:05.183
Whoo!

701
00:38:08.487 --> 00:38:09.521
You love this. don't you?

702
00:38:09.655 --> 00:38:11.323
This is what I fucking live for!

703
00:38:13.525 --> 00:38:16.294
(cars whooshing)

704
00:38:22.033 --> 00:38:25.571
(cars continue whooshing)

705
00:38:27.105 --> 00:38:29.808
(guns rustling)

706
00:38:35.781 --> 00:38:39.317
(cars continue whooshing)

707
00:38:44.656 --> 00:38:48.193
(cars continue whooshing)

708
00:38:53.665 --> 00:38:57.202
(cars continue whooshing)

709
00:39:00.839 --> 00:39:03.875
(crickets chirping)

710
00:39:07.679 --> 00:39:10.549
(car approaching)

711
00:39:16.455 --> 00:39:19.224
(car stopping)

712
00:39:20.291 --> 00:39:23.161
(buckle rustling)

713
00:39:28.634 --> 00:39:31.503
(Jonah breathing)

714
00:39:32.971 --> 00:39:35.574
(bag rustling)

715
00:39:38.877 --> 00:39:41.680
(money rustling)

716
00:39:47.853 --> 00:39:50.489
(bag rustling)

717
00:39:53.459 --> 00:39:54.760
- Fuck.

718
00:40:00.766 --> 00:40:03.635
(Jonah breathing)

719
00:40:08.073 --> 00:40:10.942
(Jonah breathing)

720
00:40:17.849 --> 00:40:20.886
(crickets chirping)

721
00:40:23.421 --> 00:40:25.390
- What the fuck are you doing?

722
00:40:25.524 --> 00:40:27.258
- What the hell are you doing
all night with Zane. huh?

723
00:40:27.392 --> 00:40:28.894
Let me guess. partying it up?

724
00:40:29.027 --> 00:40:31.396
Getting all coked up. you
plotting fucking snake?

725
00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:33.499
- You don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

726
00:40:33.632 --> 00:40:34.800
- Then enlighten me.

727
00:40:34.933 --> 00:40:36.434
'cause I can think of
only two fucking reasons

728
00:40:36.568 --> 00:40:37.335
why you're out with Zane.
- What?

729
00:40:37.469 --> 00:40:38.403
- You're getting coked up.

730
00:40:38.537 --> 00:40:40.639
or he's trying to
recruit your ass.

731
00:40:40.772 --> 00:40:42.440
- Get a fucking life.

732
00:40:42.574 --> 00:40:44.242
What I do shouldn't concern you.

733
00:40:44.375 --> 00:40:46.144
- It does when it concerns Mom.

734
00:40:47.546 --> 00:40:48.547
- What are you
even talking about?

735
00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:49.881
- Stop playing stupid. Jonah.

736
00:40:50.015 --> 00:40:51.416
You know Zane wants it all.

737
00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:53.652
and he's probably playing
your ass to get it.

738
00:40:53.785 --> 00:40:58.223
- Just fuck off and
go home. we're done.

739
00:40:58.356 --> 00:41:00.792
- Don't turn your back
on me. I'm not done.

740
00:41:00.926 --> 00:41:04.029
(men grunting)

741
00:41:04.162 --> 00:41:06.865
(Jonah gasping)

742
00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:11.036
- [Jonah] Give it to me.

743
00:41:11.169 --> 00:41:13.204
- What do we have here?

744
00:41:13.338 --> 00:41:14.640
A little payday
for a job tonight?

745
00:41:16.508 --> 00:41:17.976
You're a fucking snake.

746
00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:21.580
- Hand it the fuck over.

747
00:41:23.081 --> 00:41:24.583
- You gonna shoot me. Jonah?

748
00:41:27.252 --> 00:41:28.820
Well then do it. boo.

749
00:41:33.525 --> 00:41:35.727
Pull the trigger.
Jonah. do it.

750
00:41:38.597 --> 00:41:41.967
(whistles)
Nobody home.

751
00:41:45.436 --> 00:41:46.672
Pull the trigger. Jonah!

752
00:41:53.812 --> 00:41:55.647
That's why you'll never
leave this family.

753
00:41:57.115 --> 00:41:59.985
Enjoy your money. snake.

754
00:42:01.152 --> 00:42:03.889
- Don't fucking come back.
asshole.

755
00:42:08.059 --> 00:42:09.895
Piece of shit.

756
00:42:10.361 --> 00:42:14.165
(ominous instrumental music)

757
00:42:17.903 --> 00:42:20.806
(bottle rustling)

758
00:42:26.444 --> 00:42:29.214
(feet pattering)

759
00:42:34.986 --> 00:42:37.255
(no audio)

760
00:42:44.362 --> 00:42:46.632
(no audio)

761
00:42:53.839 --> 00:42:55.073
(bottle clanking)

762
00:42:55.206 --> 00:42:58.576
(ominous instrumental music)

763
00:43:00.679 --> 00:43:05.216
(punches thudding)
(glass breaking)

764
00:43:05.583 --> 00:43:07.385
- Listen up. motherfucker.

765
00:43:08.386 --> 00:43:10.321
I'm gonna keep this real simple.

766
00:43:11.189 --> 00:43:15.994
We see you around Jonah again.
we are going to kill you.

767
00:43:16.394 --> 00:43:17.963
We don't care what it's for.

768
00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:19.665
He doesn't want you around.

769
00:43:19.798 --> 00:43:21.499
He doesn't need around.

770
00:43:23.168 --> 00:43:24.703
We're his family now.

771
00:43:24.836 --> 00:43:28.139
- You hear that. motherfucker?
- Are we clear?

772
00:43:29.107 --> 00:43:30.441
- It might be more helpful

773
00:43:30.575 --> 00:43:33.544
if you guys play a game
of charades for me.

774
00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:36.281
Okay.

775
00:43:37.683 --> 00:43:39.350
Which one of you pussies
is holding my hair?

776
00:43:39.484 --> 00:43:42.153
I've had bitches pull
harder than that.

777
00:43:43.221 --> 00:43:44.923
- You motherfucking bitch!

778
00:43:45.056 --> 00:43:46.424
Do you hear him talking?

779
00:43:48.459 --> 00:43:50.729
- Are we clear?

780
00:43:51.797 --> 00:43:55.100
- There's only one thing
I'm not clear about.

781
00:43:55.233 --> 00:43:56.601
I just wanna know
who's gonna be sucking

782
00:43:56.735 --> 00:43:58.569
who's dick when
you're done with me.

783
00:44:01.039 --> 00:44:02.473
(punch thudding)

784
00:44:08.213 --> 00:44:10.615
(object slapping)

785
00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:14.352
(object thudding)

786
00:44:21.526 --> 00:44:24.295
- I'm just trying to teach
you a useful skill. Rebecca.

787
00:44:28.734 --> 00:44:31.202
(ominous instrumental music)

788
00:44:31.336 --> 00:44:33.004
Do it again.

789
00:44:34.105 --> 00:44:36.174
Just think of someone you hate.

790
00:44:36.307 --> 00:44:38.143
I like to think of your father.

791
00:44:43.381 --> 00:44:46.317
- What are you thinking
about. Mom. honestly?

792
00:44:46.451 --> 00:44:49.487
We're all splintered.
Cain's M.I.A.

793
00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:50.989
Your boy is nowhere.

794
00:44:51.122 --> 00:44:52.190
Even Jonah's quiet.

795
00:44:53.892 --> 00:44:54.893
Why do you think that is?

796
00:44:55.026 --> 00:44:57.963
- I have no idea.
Why don't you tell me?

797
00:45:01.532 --> 00:45:04.035
- You know what I always
admired about you?

798
00:45:04.169 --> 00:45:05.403
How smart you are.

799
00:45:06.204 --> 00:45:07.172
How you always know
what job to give

800
00:45:07.305 --> 00:45:08.639
the right person and everything.

801
00:45:10.141 --> 00:45:13.511
I'm telling yo. Zane's
giving you tunnel vision.

802
00:45:15.914 --> 00:45:17.615
- Excuse me?

803
00:45:17.749 --> 00:45:19.684
- I can't believe
how blind you are.

804
00:45:19.818 --> 00:45:21.552
You don't even see
what's happening.

805
00:45:23.989 --> 00:45:29.160
- Obviously not. so go
for it. enlighten me.

806
00:45:31.797 --> 00:45:33.698
- We all want to take over
for different reasons.

807
00:45:33.832 --> 00:45:36.334
but Zane is the only one
you cannot give it to.

808
00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:40.538
I know you care about
him. but he's not family.

809
00:45:41.406 --> 00:45:42.841
And he has other motives.

810
00:45:43.741 --> 00:45:47.078
- Is that so. and what are they?

811
00:45:48.513 --> 00:45:50.415
- You know. I don't even
care who gets it between us.

812
00:45:50.548 --> 00:45:52.984
But not Zane. mom.
fuck. not Zane.

813
00:45:53.118 --> 00:45:55.653
Jonah. at least he's loyal.

814
00:45:55.787 --> 00:45:58.389
- So. Jonah you trust right?

815
00:45:58.523 --> 00:46:00.058
- I think I'd say that. yeah.

816
00:46:01.192 --> 00:46:02.393
- Read it.

817
00:46:02.527 --> 00:46:04.595
- What is this?
- Just read it.

818
00:46:09.034 --> 00:46:10.135
- When did he send this?

819
00:46:10.268 --> 00:46:11.536
- [Isa] Just scroll
up. Becca. last night.

820
00:46:20.946 --> 00:46:22.447
- What are you gonna do?

821
00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:25.416
- Jonah's out. he wants Zane.

822
00:46:26.818 --> 00:46:28.920
Seems pretty straightforward.

823
00:46:29.054 --> 00:46:31.056
- Zane's fucking with his head.

824
00:46:31.189 --> 00:46:32.057
He got to him.

825
00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:33.558
He doesn't want this.

826
00:46:33.691 --> 00:46:35.660
- Well. one minute
he's trustworthy.

827
00:46:35.793 --> 00:46:37.495
And the next. you
don't believe him.

828
00:46:38.729 --> 00:46:40.598
Which is it. sweetheart?

829
00:46:42.433 --> 00:46:46.771
- What about me or Cain even?

830
00:46:49.574 --> 00:46:50.708
- What about you?

831
00:46:51.742 --> 00:46:53.211
- [Becca] Don't we get a say?

832
00:46:55.413 --> 00:46:58.283
- How often did you visit
me when I was recovering?

833
00:46:59.517 --> 00:47:01.286
Wanna take a guess?

834
00:47:03.288 --> 00:47:04.990
And how often was Jonah there?

835
00:47:06.491 --> 00:47:08.626
- What about Zane. was
he a frequent visitor?

836
00:47:08.759 --> 00:47:09.961
I don't wanna play
that bullshit game.

837
00:47:10.095 --> 00:47:12.130
- Okay. that may be the case.

838
00:47:12.263 --> 00:47:14.499
but the one person
who was there.

839
00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:16.834
the person that you.
yourself.

840
00:47:16.968 --> 00:47:19.837
said was the most trustworthy.
he told me who he wants.

841
00:47:21.039 --> 00:47:24.642
and it's not you. or Cain.

842
00:47:28.779 --> 00:47:30.415
Funny. isn't it?

843
00:47:32.483 --> 00:47:34.152
- You're making the
biggest mistake.

844
00:47:34.285 --> 00:47:35.853
and you don't even see it.

845
00:47:35.987 --> 00:47:38.523
That empire you spent
30 years building.

846
00:47:38.656 --> 00:47:40.125
you're just opening the gates.

847
00:47:40.258 --> 00:47:41.626
and letting the enemy
come in and just take

848
00:47:41.759 --> 00:47:42.827
whatever they want.

849
00:47:43.995 --> 00:47:46.231
Well done. Mom.
(hand slapping)

850
00:47:46.797 --> 00:47:47.598
- Get out.

851
00:47:47.732 --> 00:47:51.336
(ominous instrumental music)

852
00:47:55.873 --> 00:48:00.378
(ominous instrumental
music continues)

853
00:48:00.511 --> 00:48:03.314
(both sniffing)

854
00:48:03.448 --> 00:48:05.984
- Fuck. man.
(both cheering)

855
00:48:06.117 --> 00:48:07.852
- Good shit.

856
00:48:07.986 --> 00:48:11.722
Whoo. told ya.
best shit there is.

857
00:48:12.991 --> 00:48:14.993
- Better every fucking time.

858
00:48:16.995 --> 00:48:19.230
- Up my game. man. up my game.

859
00:48:19.364 --> 00:48:23.268
(soft instrumental music)

860
00:48:23.401 --> 00:48:25.636
- Were you guys good to
suck each other's dicks?

861
00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:27.272
Why didn't you save me some?

862
00:48:28.806 --> 00:48:32.477
- Sweet baby. Sonya. there is
more than enough to go around.

863
00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:35.346
- All I'm saying. is don't
start the party without me.

864
00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:37.082
I like to pace myself.

865
00:48:38.216 --> 00:48:39.684
- She really does.

866
00:48:40.851 --> 00:48:42.287
- She does?

867
00:48:47.658 --> 00:48:50.261
- You're making all kind
of gains. aren't ya?

868
00:48:50.695 --> 00:48:53.264
- You're the one you said.
"Keep it in the family."

869
00:48:54.966 --> 00:48:57.435
- He's a funny one. isn't he?

870
00:48:57.568 --> 00:48:59.737
He's a funny duck. (quacks)

871
00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:02.440
- Yeah?
(Zane quacking)

872
00:49:09.214 --> 00:49:11.116
- You wanna grab that for me?

873
00:49:14.452 --> 00:49:16.254
- Here. let me hold
it for you baby.

874
00:49:16.387 --> 00:49:17.722
- Yeah?

875
00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:24.829
- Fuck. where do you
get this shit. man?

876
00:49:26.464 --> 00:49:28.633
- Your mother introduced
me to all the suppliers.

877
00:49:28.766 --> 00:49:30.201
all the stash.

878
00:49:30.335 --> 00:49:32.303
How's is she feeling.
is she getting better?

879
00:49:32.937 --> 00:49:35.206
- What the fuck
did you just say?

880
00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:36.774
Why don't you go
ask her yourself?

881
00:49:36.907 --> 00:49:40.345
I'm already doing everything
you fucking want me to.

882
00:49:40.478 --> 00:49:42.080
Stop killing my buzz.

883
00:49:42.213 --> 00:49:44.149
We don't need to
talk about this shit.

884
00:49:46.217 --> 00:49:47.618
- Okay. man.

885
00:49:47.752 --> 00:49:49.620
- Turn that shit up.

886
00:49:49.754 --> 00:49:51.622
- You got it. we got shit to do-

887
00:49:51.756 --> 00:49:52.823
- Turn the shit up. man!

888
00:49:52.957 --> 00:49:55.393
- I'm turning it up. look.

889
00:49:55.526 --> 00:49:56.994
I wanna get the
ball rolling here.

890
00:49:57.128 --> 00:49:58.963
We got some business
to attend to.

891
00:49:59.097 --> 00:50:03.234
(soft instrumental
music continues)

892
00:50:03.368 --> 00:50:05.403
He got moves. huh?

893
00:50:05.536 --> 00:50:07.205
You been teaching
him a thing or two?

894
00:50:07.338 --> 00:50:09.440
(both cheering)

895
00:50:12.277 --> 00:50:17.182
All right. Jonah and the whale!

896
00:50:17.848 --> 00:50:19.317
- You gotta have some other
shit around here. man.

897
00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:21.186
What are you hiding
from me here?

898
00:50:25.723 --> 00:50:27.158
- No. no. no. no. no
don't touch those.

899
00:50:27.292 --> 00:50:29.394
You don't want
those. give 'em back.

900
00:50:29.527 --> 00:50:30.995
- Why is that?

901
00:50:31.129 --> 00:50:33.898
- They'll fuck you up slowly.
and not in a good way.

902
00:50:38.002 --> 00:50:39.237
- Then why do you have 'em?

903
00:50:40.838 --> 00:50:44.509
- Because I'm not in
a good way. (laughs)

904
00:50:44.642 --> 00:50:46.344
These are downers. you idiot.

905
00:50:46.477 --> 00:50:47.478
You want uppers.

906
00:50:47.612 --> 00:50:50.681
You wanna celebrate. elevate.

907
00:50:50.815 --> 00:50:52.683
- What are we
celebrating this time?

908
00:50:53.651 --> 00:50:56.254
- Us. family.

909
00:50:58.256 --> 00:51:01.226
- Family?
- Family.

910
00:51:02.527 --> 00:51:06.297
(ominous instrumental music)

911
00:51:10.735 --> 00:51:13.438
(door knocking)

912
00:51:18.543 --> 00:51:23.181
(ominous instrumental
music continues)

913
00:51:33.958 --> 00:51:35.793
- What the fuck?

914
00:51:36.561 --> 00:51:38.296
- It's not as bad as it looks.

915
00:51:38.429 --> 00:51:40.331
- Well it couldn't
be much worse.

916
00:51:40.465 --> 00:51:42.200
Get your sorry
fucking ass in here.

917
00:51:42.333 --> 00:51:44.235
before your neighbors
think I did it to you.

918
00:51:44.369 --> 00:51:45.736
- You got what I want or not?

919
00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:47.705
- Yeah it's over there.

920
00:51:47.838 --> 00:51:52.277
Come on. shut the door after
you. shut the fucking door.

921
00:51:52.410 --> 00:51:54.044
- Can I come in first?

922
00:51:55.413 --> 00:51:56.981
You want me to lock
it too. princess?

923
00:51:57.815 --> 00:51:58.949
Happy?

924
00:52:00.785 --> 00:52:01.919
- Are you happy?

925
00:52:05.723 --> 00:52:07.124
You know. your mom.

926
00:52:07.258 --> 00:52:08.793
she left a lot of
us out in the cold

927
00:52:08.926 --> 00:52:11.462
with her hiatus bullshit.

928
00:52:13.464 --> 00:52:15.900
- You can't find any other jobs?

929
00:52:16.033 --> 00:52:19.003
- Kid has feet in
a lot of things.

930
00:52:19.136 --> 00:52:22.273
Just getting this shit
was near impossible.

931
00:52:23.308 --> 00:52:26.677
Now. they're all clean.

932
00:52:27.878 --> 00:52:31.349
virtually. totally untraceable.

933
00:52:32.683 --> 00:52:36.821
Now. which one do you want?

934
00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:41.459
- [Caine] All of them.

935
00:52:44.094 --> 00:52:49.133
(ominous instrumental
music continues)

936
00:52:49.434 --> 00:52:51.001
- [Roddy] You could
walk into city hall.

937
00:52:51.135 --> 00:52:52.970
shoot the fuck out of the
place. and those dumb shits

938
00:52:53.103 --> 00:52:55.873
would not know who to trace.

939
00:52:59.644 --> 00:53:04.682
Tell me you're not using
these guns for jobs.

940
00:53:07.285 --> 00:53:08.653
Dude. look. I don't

941
00:53:08.786 --> 00:53:12.757
like him either
but he rolls deep.

942
00:53:12.890 --> 00:53:14.392
do not do this.

943
00:53:15.693 --> 00:53:17.495
- I know what I'm up against.

944
00:53:17.628 --> 00:53:20.498
- Yeah? If you know
what you're up against.

945
00:53:20.631 --> 00:53:23.468
you'll know to just
leave it the fuck alone.

946
00:53:23.601 --> 00:53:25.870
He's got it. uour
mother is recovering.

947
00:53:26.003 --> 00:53:28.506
Your sister and your brother
are fine now just leave it

948
00:53:28.639 --> 00:53:29.907
the fuck alone.

949
00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:34.612
- You want the money or not?
- Yeah.

950
00:53:35.513 --> 00:53:37.548
- Then keep your fucking
opinions to yourself.

951
00:53:37.682 --> 00:53:38.916
and give me the fucking guns.

952
00:53:39.049 --> 00:53:40.084
I didn't come here
for a pep talk.

953
00:53:40.217 --> 00:53:41.752
I came here to do business.

954
00:53:41.886 --> 00:53:45.590
- Look. I don't wanna watch
you do something stupid.

955
00:53:45.723 --> 00:53:48.726
Your mother has made her choice.

956
00:53:48.859 --> 00:53:50.495
I know it sucks. I
don't like it either.

957
00:53:50.628 --> 00:53:53.998
- Then why didn't you
say anything. huh?

958
00:53:55.165 --> 00:53:58.068
I know you hate Zane
just as much as I do.

959
00:53:58.202 --> 00:53:59.370
You've known my
mom for 30 years.

960
00:53:59.504 --> 00:54:01.105
30 fucking years. Roddy.

961
00:54:03.007 --> 00:54:05.310
You stood on the sideline
like a little bitch.

962
00:54:06.577 --> 00:54:11.115
- You know. you've always
had a big mouth kid.

963
00:54:11.248 --> 00:54:13.117
Let me tell you something.

964
00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:16.086
I'm not your brother.
and I'm not your sister.

965
00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:19.089
I don't take that shit from you.

966
00:54:19.223 --> 00:54:21.759
because I will make
what they did to you

967
00:54:21.892 --> 00:54:24.929
look like a fucking cakewalk.

968
00:54:26.997 --> 00:54:28.566
- They already took my brother.

969
00:54:29.934 --> 00:54:30.901
And Becca's out.

970
00:54:32.269 --> 00:54:34.772
And Ma. you know when
she makes a choice.

971
00:54:34.905 --> 00:54:37.308
she becomes a stubborn bitch.

972
00:54:38.643 --> 00:54:40.345
Doesn't change her mind.

973
00:54:40.478 --> 00:54:43.247
The little fucker took what
left I had and ran with it.

974
00:54:46.083 --> 00:54:46.951
This.

975
00:54:51.556 --> 00:54:53.758
this is all I know. Roddy.

976
00:54:55.426 --> 00:54:57.395
And I'm not gonna bend
a fucking knee to him.

977
00:54:57.528 --> 00:54:58.596
and I know you aren't either.

978
00:54:58.729 --> 00:55:00.331
qnd that's why we're doing this.

979
00:55:01.866 --> 00:55:05.936
- I'm asking you take your
stuff and get out now.

980
00:55:08.406 --> 00:55:12.877
I'll keep this. I'll help
you get into your car.

981
00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:15.312
- You don't get it. do you?

982
00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:18.483
When I said. "We're doing this."

983
00:55:19.917 --> 00:55:22.953
I meant we are doing this.

984
00:55:24.589 --> 00:55:26.190
How long has it been. Roddy?

985
00:55:28.058 --> 00:55:29.527
- What are you talking about?

986
00:55:31.295 --> 00:55:34.098
- You know. I remember
hearing it on the news.

987
00:55:34.231 --> 00:55:37.468
I knew something didn't add up.

988
00:55:37.602 --> 00:55:39.404
I know him well too.

989
00:55:39.537 --> 00:55:42.573
If Zane would have been doing
his fucking job that day.

990
00:55:42.707 --> 00:55:44.709
shit would have gone
down differently.

991
00:55:46.343 --> 00:55:49.580
Maybe. if Sabina-

992
00:55:49.714 --> 00:55:52.149
- No. no. no. no.

993
00:55:52.282 --> 00:55:55.853
You never say that word to me.

994
00:55:57.321 --> 00:56:00.458
You're just a fucking
snake like Zane.

995
00:56:00.591 --> 00:56:02.593
except you try to
hide it better.

996
00:56:03.761 --> 00:56:05.530
'cause you know I have
a love for your mother.

997
00:56:05.663 --> 00:56:09.400
and this family. but you're
still a fucking snake.

998
00:56:10.735 --> 00:56:15.339
You use my own blood.
and what happened.

999
00:56:15.473 --> 00:56:19.209
to get me to work with you.

1000
00:56:19.343 --> 00:56:22.913
I should just fucking do you
right now. you son of a bitch.

1001
00:56:23.047 --> 00:56:26.350
It might stop a lot of
shit that's gonna go down.

1002
00:56:28.152 --> 00:56:30.254
- I'd be the happiest boy
in the world right now.

1003
00:56:30.387 --> 00:56:34.425
if you pulled that trigger.
but you ain't gonna.

1004
00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:37.161
- Getting rid of you?

1005
00:56:37.294 --> 00:56:41.966
Oh. that would be
so fucking easy.

1006
00:56:45.035 --> 00:56:45.903
- Nate.

1007
00:56:49.406 --> 00:56:50.941
That's what I thought.

1008
00:56:52.176 --> 00:56:54.211
You ain't gonna.
because of my family.

1009
00:56:55.813 --> 00:57:00.384
(ominous instrumental
music continues)

1010
00:57:02.052 --> 00:57:05.022
We both know I'm a prick.
that doesn't change anything.

1011
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:07.625
There are lines you don't cross.

1012
00:57:07.758 --> 00:57:09.627
You know it and I know it.

1013
00:57:10.427 --> 00:57:12.162
Zane doesn't give a fuck.

1014
00:57:13.097 --> 00:57:14.499
He'll take any part
of our families.

1015
00:57:14.632 --> 00:57:16.667
and use them as pawns in
his little fucking games.

1016
00:57:16.801 --> 00:57:17.802
He's already torn yours apart.

1017
00:57:17.935 --> 00:57:18.903
and now he's working on mine.

1018
00:57:19.036 --> 00:57:20.437
and I can't let that happen.

1019
00:57:20.571 --> 00:57:21.772
I know there are times
where it looks like.

1020
00:57:21.906 --> 00:57:23.608
I don't give a fuck.

1021
00:57:24.441 --> 00:57:27.878
I do half-assed jobs. I show
up late. I rib on Jonah.

1022
00:57:29.547 --> 00:57:32.750
But I'd never turn my
back on them. ever!

1023
00:57:34.719 --> 00:57:36.954
Because that's my
fucking family.

1024
00:57:39.356 --> 00:57:40.791
Now I can't prove it.

1025
00:57:41.792 --> 00:57:44.962
but it sure as hell ain't a
coincidence that Zane shows up.

1026
00:57:45.095 --> 00:57:47.097
and people start
dying left and right.

1027
00:57:47.231 --> 00:57:49.634
and all of a sudden. he
starts rising to the top.

1028
00:57:51.135 --> 00:57:52.970
I fucking need you. Roddy.

1029
00:57:55.973 --> 00:57:59.744
You can't let this scumbag
end my family. you just can't.

1030
00:58:05.082 --> 00:58:07.451
- We're done. now.

1031
00:58:08.285 --> 00:58:12.890
(ominous instrumental
music continues)

1032
00:58:17.327 --> 00:58:21.966
(ominous instrumental
music continues)

1033
00:58:26.671 --> 00:58:31.308
(ominous instrumental
music continues)

1034
00:58:32.777 --> 00:58:35.512
- I want you to think about
every job that you've done.

1035
00:58:36.914 --> 00:58:39.283
every single time that
you've worked with Zane.

1036
00:58:41.118 --> 00:58:42.687
just really think about it.

1037
00:58:44.354 --> 00:58:45.856
and then you tell
me whether or not

1038
00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:47.524
you think I'm lying about him.

1039
00:58:54.164 --> 00:58:56.767
(door slamming)

1040
00:58:56.901 --> 00:58:59.704
(feet pattering)

1041
00:59:03.173 --> 00:59:05.643
(gun firing)

1042
00:59:07.945 --> 00:59:09.714
- No. no. no. please.

1043
00:59:12.516 --> 00:59:14.118
Please. ah. no. no.

1044
00:59:15.586 --> 00:59:17.021
(gun firing)

1045
00:59:17.154 --> 00:59:20.124
- (laughs) Nicely done.

1046
00:59:21.325 --> 00:59:23.861
- [Jonah] You're
not so bad yourself.

1047
00:59:23.994 --> 00:59:26.631
(phone ringing)

1048
00:59:28.332 --> 00:59:29.199
- Shit.

1049
00:59:30.635 --> 00:59:33.437
Yo. No. no. no. perfect timing.

1050
00:59:33.570 --> 00:59:35.840
Yeah. just come up to the
door. and I'll let you in.

1051
00:59:35.973 --> 00:59:38.175
Do the secret knock. all right.

1052
00:59:39.509 --> 00:59:40.745
- Who the hell was that?

1053
00:59:40.878 --> 00:59:41.746
- That's the last
piece of the puzzle.

1054
00:59:41.879 --> 00:59:43.180
- Coming here?

1055
00:59:43.313 --> 00:59:44.815
You couldn't have
picked a better spot?

1056
00:59:44.949 --> 00:59:45.916
- It's the perfect spot.

1057
00:59:46.050 --> 00:59:47.384
5-0 doesn't know we're here.

1058
00:59:47.517 --> 00:59:48.986
Nobody knows we're here.

1059
00:59:49.119 --> 00:59:52.089
These guys certainly don't
know we're fucking here.

1060
00:59:52.222 --> 00:59:54.659
- Still. man. I don't
like dicking around after-

1061
00:59:54.792 --> 00:59:56.326
- Hey. relax. it'll be quick.

1062
00:59:56.460 --> 00:59:58.095
Plus. you already know this guy.

1063
01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:02.900
(feet pattering)

1064
01:00:05.402 --> 01:00:07.204
- What the fuck. man.

1065
01:00:11.008 --> 01:00:13.778
(feet pattering)

1066
01:00:17.314 --> 01:00:20.851
(feet continue pattering)

1067
01:00:26.490 --> 01:00:29.459
(clothes rustling)

1068
01:00:33.731 --> 01:00:37.067
(feet pattering)

1069
01:00:37.201 --> 01:00:39.403
- (laughs) Looks
like we're getting

1070
01:00:39.536 --> 01:00:42.306
the band back together.
- Roddy?

1071
01:00:44.141 --> 01:00:46.476
- Well. it looks
like you two boys

1072
01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:48.512
are having way too much fun.

1073
01:00:49.613 --> 01:00:51.148
- What are you doing here?

1074
01:00:51.281 --> 01:00:52.717
- I was invited.

1075
01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:54.618
- Yeah. I figured we
can't complete our team

1076
01:00:54.752 --> 01:00:58.555
without our MVP clean-up
man on the crew.

1077
01:00:58.689 --> 01:01:00.357
- Where have you been. man?

1078
01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:02.793
- I've been keeping my head
down like everyone else.

1079
01:01:02.927 --> 01:01:04.128
- It's about to
get a lot busier.

1080
01:01:04.261 --> 01:01:06.463
because we gotta
talk some business.

1081
01:01:06.596 --> 01:01:08.799
- Why did you bring me here.

1082
01:01:08.933 --> 01:01:10.600
to just go up there.

1083
01:01:10.735 --> 01:01:13.037
and clean up that
mess. seriously?

1084
01:01:14.404 --> 01:01:15.840
- Think bigger.

1085
01:01:17.274 --> 01:01:19.844
- OH you mean you've
got lots of rooms

1086
01:01:19.977 --> 01:01:21.879
up there with lots of
bodies and I'm gonna

1087
01:01:22.012 --> 01:01:23.580
clean up all of them?

1088
01:01:24.481 --> 01:01:27.417
- I'm talking about doing
this full time again.

1089
01:01:27.551 --> 01:01:28.552
going all in.

1090
01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:32.189
You think the last 30 years
have been good to you?

1091
01:01:32.322 --> 01:01:33.891
You ain't seen nothing yet.

1092
01:01:36.193 --> 01:01:37.394
- Does Isa want this?

1093
01:01:38.763 --> 01:01:40.330
- We all want this.

1094
01:01:40.464 --> 01:01:42.132
- Who the fuck is we?

1095
01:01:42.266 --> 01:01:47.004
- Her boy. for one.
herself. another.

1096
01:01:47.137 --> 01:01:49.673
And I figure a ringing
endorsement from the living

1097
01:01:49.807 --> 01:01:54.378
legend himself. could
only seal the deal.

1098
01:01:54.511 --> 01:01:55.946
- Oh. right.

1099
01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:00.517
You know. you two were
doing so well without me.

1100
01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:02.686
What happened?

1101
01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:05.555
Don't tell me. of course.

1102
01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:09.927
You need that last endorsement.

1103
01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:13.697
Then you'll get
it. the holy bible.

1104
01:02:15.199 --> 01:02:18.402
- I thought you said
she gave you the bible.

1105
01:02:18.535 --> 01:02:20.871
- Basically. she already did.

1106
01:02:21.005 --> 01:02:22.372
We're all good.

1107
01:02:22.506 --> 01:02:25.042
All I'm doing here
is making sure anyone

1108
01:02:25.175 --> 01:02:28.478
who has been loyal
is paid there due.

1109
01:02:31.515 --> 01:02:36.020
- Zane. out of all
your wondrous talents.

1110
01:02:36.987 --> 01:02:40.757
listening to you
trying to convince me.

1111
01:02:40.891 --> 01:02:45.930
is like listening to
a sloppy-assed old
used car salesman

1112
01:02:46.931 --> 01:02:48.398
try to sell me something.

1113
01:02:49.433 --> 01:02:52.569
- You know I just did
15 people upstairs.

1114
01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:55.906
so pardon me if I'm not
speaking eloquently right now.

1115
01:02:56.040 --> 01:03:00.144
- Oh. I'm sorry. oh. did
I upset the little boy?

1116
01:03:00.277 --> 01:03:03.147
- Come on you're a fucking
numbers guy anyway.

1117
01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.315
Right. fuck my wordage.

1118
01:03:05.449 --> 01:03:07.751
Tell him. Jonah.

1119
01:03:07.885 --> 01:03:10.587
I've upped everybody
who's been loyal to Isa

1120
01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.789
who is now loyal to me.

1121
01:03:12.923 --> 01:03:16.660
- Is this right. Zane's
looking after you?

1122
01:03:16.793 --> 01:03:20.597
(ominous instrumental music)

1123
01:03:21.465 --> 01:03:23.333
- Yeah.

1124
01:03:25.402 --> 01:03:26.603
- You haven't seen
much of your family.

1125
01:03:26.736 --> 01:03:28.272
since your mother
got ill. have you?

1126
01:03:31.608 --> 01:03:33.110
- What are you talking about?

1127
01:03:34.478 --> 01:03:36.013
I'm with family right now.

1128
01:03:37.948 --> 01:03:39.049
- My boy.

1129
01:03:40.217 --> 01:03:42.752
- I guess you want me to
work for you exclusively.

1130
01:03:43.921 --> 01:03:47.324
so that I will give this
wonderful endorsement.

1131
01:03:47.457 --> 01:03:49.326
- She sees you give
me the thumbs up.

1132
01:03:49.459 --> 01:03:50.928
she gives me the
rest of the numbers.

1133
01:03:51.061 --> 01:03:52.362
That's all I need.

1134
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.367
- You know what?

1135
01:03:59.336 --> 01:04:01.005
I need time to digest this.

1136
01:04:01.138 --> 01:04:02.973
It's just too much information.

1137
01:04:04.508 --> 01:04:07.677
I'll clean up the room upstairs
for you like I said I would.

1138
01:04:08.545 --> 01:04:10.347
- Don't you wanna
hear the numbers?

1139
01:04:11.448 --> 01:04:14.118
- I'm sure you'll pay
me what it's worth.

1140
01:04:14.251 --> 01:04:16.186
Look. I got a lot of shit
in the truck I've gotta

1141
01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.455
bring in here so I'm gonna
go out and get it. all right?

1142
01:04:18.588 --> 01:04:21.058
- Hey. you're
doing a good thing.

1143
01:04:21.191 --> 01:04:22.059
It's a good call.

1144
01:04:22.993 --> 01:04:24.628
You're on the right team again.

1145
01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:31.068
- Yeah. I'll be back.

1146
01:04:34.538 --> 01:04:37.541
(Zane laughing)

1147
01:04:37.674 --> 01:04:38.608
- We're good to go.

1148
01:04:38.742 --> 01:04:40.244
We're golden. you see that?

1149
01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:42.879
He's in. right?

1150
01:04:43.013 --> 01:04:46.350
- Yeah. I think he's
gonna endorse you.

1151
01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:50.387
- (laughs) We're gonna
celebrate tonight.

1152
01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:51.888
We're gonna have a party.

1153
01:04:52.022 --> 01:04:54.891
My sister is in my
house waiting for you.

1154
01:04:56.393 --> 01:04:58.528
- That sounds great.

1155
01:04:58.662 --> 01:05:00.064
But I think I'm a bit tired.

1156
01:05:00.197 --> 01:05:02.232
I'm probably just
gonna go back home

1157
01:05:02.366 --> 01:05:04.068
and pass the fuck out. okay?

1158
01:05:04.901 --> 01:05:07.637
- Well. hey. look. if
you change your mind.

1159
01:05:07.771 --> 01:05:09.706
we'll be going all night.

1160
01:05:12.709 --> 01:05:17.714
- Yeah? You gonna finally
invite my mom over too?

1161
01:05:19.984 --> 01:05:21.051
- What's the matter?

1162
01:05:22.019 --> 01:05:24.788
You're getting a little
testy there. aren't ya?

1163
01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:26.690
- Nah. I'm just a little
out of it right now.

1164
01:05:26.823 --> 01:05:31.561
I'm sorry. we'll talk
later. all right?

1165
01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:40.004
(ominous instrumental
music continues)

1166
01:05:40.137 --> 01:05:42.139
- Well. that was interesting.

1167
01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:46.543
(birds chirping)

1168
01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:55.652
(door slamming)

1169
01:05:58.188 --> 01:05:59.789
- Well if you're
going to stand there.

1170
01:05:59.923 --> 01:06:02.959
and stare. do you want to
help me while you're doing it?

1171
01:06:05.562 --> 01:06:08.198
- Yeah. sorry.

1172
01:06:08.332 --> 01:06:11.635
- So you and Zane. eh?

1173
01:06:11.768 --> 01:06:14.338
- I haven't thought it
would happen either.

1174
01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:15.305
Didn't think he'd want
me as his right-hand

1175
01:06:15.439 --> 01:06:16.840
man out of everybody.

1176
01:06:18.142 --> 01:06:20.144
- You ever thought
to ask yourself why?

1177
01:06:22.279 --> 01:06:24.448
- It's going good so far.

1178
01:06:25.382 --> 01:06:28.018
He's taking good care of
me. Better than I ever was.

1179
01:06:30.487 --> 01:06:33.123
- So Zane's now your family?

1180
01:06:37.461 --> 01:06:38.462
He's looking after you?

1181
01:06:38.595 --> 01:06:40.364
- You know what I mean.

1182
01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:41.731
- No. I don't.

1183
01:06:43.467 --> 01:06:46.536
- Look. you and I don't
know each other very well.

1184
01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:48.138
with you mostly
taking care of all the

1185
01:06:48.272 --> 01:06:50.607
shit after-the-fact.
but let me fill you in.

1186
01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:54.478
my brother. my sister. they
don't give a fuck about me.

1187
01:06:56.246 --> 01:06:57.114
they never did.

1188
01:06:58.282 --> 01:07:03.087
So yeah. it feels good
for a change to finally

1189
01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:04.688
have somebody who puts me out

1190
01:07:04.821 --> 01:07:09.093
on the line for
nothing in return.

1191
01:07:09.226 --> 01:07:10.894
- Nothing in return. eh?

1192
01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:15.099
You know. he gets
a lot in return.

1193
01:07:15.232 --> 01:07:18.202
If you can convince
me to roll over.

1194
01:07:18.335 --> 01:07:23.373
and go to Isa and tell her
that he's the one. (laughs)

1195
01:07:24.808 --> 01:07:26.042
- Whatever. man.

1196
01:07:26.843 --> 01:07:28.578
You do whatever
the fuck you want.

1197
01:07:29.679 --> 01:07:31.148
Zane's offering you gold.

1198
01:07:31.281 --> 01:07:33.250
and you'd be a dumb
fuck for not taking it.

1199
01:07:35.552 --> 01:07:37.221
- Seen your brother lately?

1200
01:07:39.389 --> 01:07:40.590
- What did you say?

1201
01:07:42.826 --> 01:07:47.697
- It's a simple question.
have you seen Cain lately?

1202
01:07:49.233 --> 01:07:51.401
- Not since the
prick ambushed me.

1203
01:07:52.369 --> 01:07:54.371
- Well I guess he
learned his lesson then.

1204
01:07:54.504 --> 01:07:56.440
Did you happen to
see him after that?

1205
01:07:56.573 --> 01:07:58.041
- No.

1206
01:07:58.175 --> 01:07:59.709
- So he hasn't tried to
hit you up for anything?

1207
01:07:59.843 --> 01:08:02.112
- No. he hasn't.

1208
01:08:03.713 --> 01:08:05.115
What the fuck's your point?

1209
01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:07.317
- He's alert.

1210
01:08:07.451 --> 01:08:08.885
He knows what's going on.

1211
01:08:09.018 --> 01:08:12.055
He knows not to fuck
with people in power.

1212
01:08:14.724 --> 01:08:16.726
I gotta go.

1213
01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:17.861
The boss wants me.

1214
01:08:17.994 --> 01:08:19.263
I've gotta do things for him.

1215
01:08:20.530 --> 01:08:25.402
You. take care of yourself.

1216
01:08:29.038 --> 01:08:31.741
- Fuck.

1217
01:08:31.875 --> 01:08:34.644
(birds chirping)

1218
01:08:37.647 --> 01:08:40.450
(cars whooshing)

1219
01:08:42.652 --> 01:08:45.189
(car beeping)

1220
01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:49.659
(engine revving)

1221
01:08:52.996 --> 01:08:55.699
(car whooshing)

1222
01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:03.139
- That for me.

1223
01:09:07.811 --> 01:09:10.980
Mm.

1224
01:09:11.114 --> 01:09:14.518
That's good.
(phone ringing)

1225
01:09:15.719 --> 01:09:16.986
Jonah?

1226
01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:17.954
- Hey. Kenny.

1227
01:09:18.087 --> 01:09:19.155
Sorry. I got held up.

1228
01:09:19.289 --> 01:09:20.324
What's up with Isa?

1229
01:09:21.225 --> 01:09:22.859
- I got the test results back.

1230
01:09:23.827 --> 01:09:28.332
It was negative. there's
nothing wrong with her. yeah.

1231
01:09:28.465 --> 01:09:32.035
Whoever did it. it
was intentional.

1232
01:09:32.168 --> 01:09:33.303
No accident.

1233
01:09:34.238 --> 01:09:39.243
It had to be someone close to
her. someone in the circle.

1234
01:09:40.644 --> 01:09:42.078
I know.

1235
01:09:42.212 --> 01:09:44.214
The best action now is
to keep getting her rest.

1236
01:09:44.348 --> 01:09:47.217
and to keep me posted. Let me
know if she needs anything.

1237
01:09:48.785 --> 01:09:51.488
(Jonah panting)

1238
01:09:54.891 --> 01:09:57.861
(car beeping)

1239
01:09:57.994 --> 01:10:00.730
(door slamming)

1240
01:10:00.864 --> 01:10:02.599
- [Franklin] Take
in the nose. like.

1241
01:10:02.732 --> 01:10:05.235
what's up with that shit?

1242
01:10:05.369 --> 01:10:07.070
Hey. let's go.
- Hey.

1243
01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:08.472
- What's up.
brother. what's good?

1244
01:10:08.605 --> 01:10:09.873
- Hey.
- Y'all ready?

1245
01:10:10.006 --> 01:10:12.242
Aye. let's do a
big one right here.

1246
01:10:12.376 --> 01:10:13.810
Let's get it.
- Cheers.

1247
01:10:13.943 --> 01:10:15.812
- [Franklin] Even
though we did that.

1248
01:10:16.846 --> 01:10:19.249
- So why's your brother
hanging out with Jonah so much?

1249
01:10:19.383 --> 01:10:20.984
- Yeah. don't tell
me you both actually

1250
01:10:21.117 --> 01:10:22.986
like doing jobs with him.

1251
01:10:23.119 --> 01:10:24.854
- I told y'all not
to say anything.

1252
01:10:25.722 --> 01:10:28.325
- Why don't you two mind
your own fucking business?

1253
01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:30.760
Don't forget where you are.

1254
01:10:32.496 --> 01:10:34.664
- Don't make us throw
y'all asses out of here.

1255
01:10:34.798 --> 01:10:36.266
saying some shit like that.

1256
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:42.406
- Time to bounce.

1257
01:10:44.374 --> 01:10:45.442
Did you hear me?

1258
01:10:45.575 --> 01:10:47.977
I said get the fuck out of here!

1259
01:10:48.111 --> 01:10:50.547
Take your girlfriends.
find a nice view.

1260
01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:52.716
maybe roll down a fucking hill!

1261
01:10:52.849 --> 01:10:54.384
Get some grass stains.

1262
01:10:54.518 --> 01:10:56.152
Go!
- Yo. what happened?

1263
01:10:56.286 --> 01:10:57.621
- Do we really gotta go though?

1264
01:10:57.754 --> 01:11:01.491
We just ordered hot wings.
- Hot wings?

1265
01:11:01.625 --> 01:11:02.792
I wanna be alone!

1266
01:11:04.528 --> 01:11:06.596
Don't sit. stand. and then walk.

1267
01:11:06.730 --> 01:11:08.298
- Come on. y'all.

1268
01:11:08.432 --> 01:11:11.034
- Get the fuck out. go. go!

1269
01:11:16.873 --> 01:11:17.907
Fuck.

1270
01:11:19.175 --> 01:11:20.944
- You gonna kick me out too?

1271
01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:23.913
- Fucking wish I could.

1272
01:11:27.684 --> 01:11:29.986
This has nothing to
do with that old fuck.

1273
01:11:32.389 --> 01:11:33.557
- Where's Jonah?

1274
01:11:34.391 --> 01:11:36.493
- He decided to
take the night off.

1275
01:11:37.761 --> 01:11:39.596
- That doesn't sound like him.

1276
01:11:39.729 --> 01:11:42.298
- Everybody's acting a
little odd around here.

1277
01:11:48.438 --> 01:11:53.477
- Okay. what's going
on. hmm. what is it?

1278
01:11:54.277 --> 01:11:56.012
- I lose him. I lose everything.

1279
01:11:58.247 --> 01:11:59.983
- What are you
talking about. huh?

1280
01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:04.454
What is it?
- Nothing. nothing.

1281
01:12:04.588 --> 01:12:06.122
Just thinking out loud. okay?

1282
01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:13.830
- You told me once we had
him. the rest would follow.

1283
01:12:13.963 --> 01:12:17.934
So what the fuck do I need
to do to unfuck this. huh?

1284
01:12:18.067 --> 01:12:18.935
Tell me!

1285
01:12:20.504 --> 01:12:22.205
- Keep your legs open.

1286
01:12:22.338 --> 01:12:23.540
- Fuck you.

1287
01:12:23.673 --> 01:12:25.875
- You little fucking shit.

1288
01:12:27.577 --> 01:12:28.845
- How dare you.

1289
01:12:30.279 --> 01:12:35.318
Look. I just know how
close we are to this.

1290
01:12:35.519 --> 01:12:40.023
And I know how hard you've
been busting your ass.

1291
01:12:40.156 --> 01:12:43.393
We just can't give up
right now. we can't.

1292
01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:45.562
- I know.

1293
01:12:46.663 --> 01:12:49.065
- Okay. then what
are you gonna do?

1294
01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:50.734
I need to know the plan.
- Shut up!

1295
01:12:56.005 --> 01:12:57.741
- Here. let me-
- I got it!

1296
01:13:04.247 --> 01:13:06.049
- Are those Tic Tacs?

1297
01:13:08.384 --> 01:13:13.423
- He knows.
(ominous instrumental music)

1298
01:13:16.025 --> 01:13:18.728
(guns rustling)

1299
01:13:19.963 --> 01:13:22.666
(Becca sighing)

1300
01:13:26.169 --> 01:13:29.072
(guns rustling)

1301
01:13:29.205 --> 01:13:30.173
- I'm helping you out.

1302
01:13:30.306 --> 01:13:33.342
but then you're on your own.

1303
01:13:39.415 --> 01:13:41.117
Cain. do you hear me?

1304
01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:44.387
You're going solo.

1305
01:13:47.691 --> 01:13:50.393
(guns rustling)

1306
01:13:53.763 --> 01:13:56.566
(birds chirping)

1307
01:14:02.539 --> 01:14:06.576
(birds continue chirping)

1308
01:14:06.710 --> 01:14:09.412
(car whooshing)

1309
01:14:13.249 --> 01:14:18.287
(door slamming)
(intense instrumental music)

1310
01:14:20.423 --> 01:14:25.461
(door knocking)
(people faintly speaking)

1311
01:14:25.795 --> 01:14:26.896
- Mom you there?
- Jonah. what are you-

1312
01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:28.632
- Come on. open up!

1313
01:14:30.734 --> 01:14:33.837
- Oh my. God. Jonah. it's
two o'clock in the morning.

1314
01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:35.271
Can't this wait?

1315
01:14:35.404 --> 01:14:37.006
- You weren't picking
up your phone.

1316
01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:38.274
We need to talk now.

1317
01:14:38.407 --> 01:14:40.009
There's something
you need to know.

1318
01:14:41.477 --> 01:14:42.846
- Sweetie. now's
just not a good time.

1319
01:14:42.979 --> 01:14:44.681
- No it can't wait. Mom.

1320
01:14:45.782 --> 01:14:47.316
- You doing okay. babe?
- Yeah.

1321
01:14:47.450 --> 01:14:51.287
Uh. just trying to figure
out what's going on.

1322
01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:52.355
- What is going on.
what is going on?

1323
01:14:54.691 --> 01:14:56.159
- [Isa] Knock it off.

1324
01:14:56.292 --> 01:14:59.128
- What is going on Jonah?

1325
01:14:59.262 --> 01:15:00.496
Jonah!

1326
01:15:00.630 --> 01:15:02.566
- What are you doing here?

1327
01:15:02.699 --> 01:15:04.067
- Why are you here?

1328
01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.468
Yes. that's a very
good question.

1329
01:15:05.602 --> 01:15:07.336
He. uh. he surprised
me and stopped

1330
01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:09.839
by. and by the way.
it's about time.

1331
01:15:09.973 --> 01:15:11.875
because if it had
been one more day.

1332
01:15:12.008 --> 01:15:14.077
I would have had you...

1333
01:15:14.210 --> 01:15:17.581
(Isa laughing)
(Zane murmuring)

1334
01:15:17.714 --> 01:15:19.348
- Stop it.
- I've been so busy. baby.

1335
01:15:19.482 --> 01:15:21.217
I've been so busy.

1336
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:23.519
I just had to make the
time and finally come

1337
01:15:23.653 --> 01:15:25.354
and do what's right.

1338
01:15:27.824 --> 01:15:31.861
- Okay. knock it off my
son is right here. stop.

1339
01:15:33.029 --> 01:15:34.197
- Enough about us.

1340
01:15:35.932 --> 01:15:38.167
What are you doing here?

1341
01:15:38.301 --> 01:15:41.170
You got any news
to share with us?

1342
01:15:42.471 --> 01:15:44.674
- I guess not. we can
talk about it tomorrow.

1343
01:15:44.808 --> 01:15:47.376
- Jonah. you look
like you're in shock.

1344
01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:51.047
I know this is confusing.
and believe me. I was ready

1345
01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:52.716
to break up with
this son of a bitch.

1346
01:15:52.849 --> 01:15:54.383
- Who are you calling bitch?

1347
01:15:54.517 --> 01:15:58.087
Who are you calling bitch?
- Oh. stop it.

1348
01:16:00.857 --> 01:16:03.627
He came over tonight.
and I don't know.

1349
01:16:05.595 --> 01:16:07.130
We just worked everything out.

1350
01:16:08.264 --> 01:16:10.533
- I'm sorry for
coming over so late.

1351
01:16:10.667 --> 01:16:12.301
There are still things we
need to talk about. Mom.

1352
01:16:12.435 --> 01:16:16.205
that I think you would
want to know. alone.

1353
01:16:17.874 --> 01:16:19.408
- Okay. Jonah.

1354
01:16:19.542 --> 01:16:21.577
I'm running around like
crazy tomorrow morning.

1355
01:16:21.711 --> 01:16:24.113
but how about you come over

1356
01:16:24.247 --> 01:16:26.515
before I go over to
Zane's. does that work?

1357
01:16:27.851 --> 01:16:29.352
- What's going down tomorrow?

1358
01:16:30.153 --> 01:16:31.755
- Oh I didn't tell him.
- You didn't tell him?

1359
01:16:31.888 --> 01:16:32.689
- No. I didn't.

1360
01:16:32.822 --> 01:16:34.523
Do you want to tell him?

1361
01:16:34.658 --> 01:16:35.859
- Yeah. maybe I
should break the news.

1362
01:16:35.992 --> 01:16:37.526
- Okay.

1363
01:16:37.661 --> 01:16:40.563
- We're gathering together
in a holy union of sorts.

1364
01:16:41.597 --> 01:16:44.133
A proverbial passing
of the bible.

1365
01:16:46.369 --> 01:16:47.370
- Is that true. Mom?

1366
01:16:48.404 --> 01:16:51.240
- Yeah. We finally
made a decision.

1367
01:16:52.108 --> 01:16:53.609
I don't know.

1368
01:16:53.743 --> 01:16:54.744
He told me how he's
taking you under his wing.

1369
01:16:54.878 --> 01:16:57.613
and you're like a son to him.

1370
01:16:57.747 --> 01:17:00.817
It just feels right.

1371
01:17:01.818 --> 01:17:05.288
So tomorrow. I'm gonna
give him the business.

1372
01:17:05.421 --> 01:17:06.923
and we're gonna
have a little party

1373
01:17:07.056 --> 01:17:08.591
at his house to celebrate.

1374
01:17:08.725 --> 01:17:09.592
- At his house?

1375
01:17:11.594 --> 01:17:14.030
Why don't we have it
here. at your place?

1376
01:17:14.163 --> 01:17:19.202
I think it's more fitting.
and Zane is such a gentleman.

1377
01:17:20.403 --> 01:17:22.105
I'm sure he'll be okay with it.

1378
01:17:22.238 --> 01:17:23.940
- [Isa] That could be good
too. what do you think. honey?

1379
01:17:24.073 --> 01:17:26.776
- We'll have a real celebration.

1380
01:17:27.877 --> 01:17:29.078
- Okay. honey.

1381
01:17:30.413 --> 01:17:32.782
- My sister's setting up
all the chairs at my house.

1382
01:17:32.916 --> 01:17:36.485
- It makes so much more
sense to have it here.

1383
01:17:36.619 --> 01:17:40.423
I can even bring him
little present tomorrow.

1384
01:17:41.825 --> 01:17:43.793
We gotta have all eyes on Zane.

1385
01:17:43.927 --> 01:17:44.794
- Okay.

1386
01:17:46.429 --> 01:17:48.097
- You deserve it after all.

1387
01:17:49.398 --> 01:17:50.800
- Jonah. I think
it's a great idea.

1388
01:17:50.934 --> 01:17:52.836
I love the sight of you.

1389
01:17:52.969 --> 01:17:54.337
Sweetheart. just go
home and get some rest.

1390
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:55.171
I'll see you tomorrow. okay?

1391
01:17:55.304 --> 01:17:56.172
- Mom.

1392
01:17:57.707 --> 01:18:00.009
Zane taught me a whole lot.

1393
01:18:01.544 --> 01:18:04.413
and it really opened my eyes.

1394
01:18:05.281 --> 01:18:10.053
but. remember. don't pass
the bible off tomorrow.

1395
01:18:10.186 --> 01:18:11.654
until I get here.

1396
01:18:11.788 --> 01:18:15.691
I want to be here when
it all unfolds in person.

1397
01:18:18.694 --> 01:18:20.997
So promise me. Mom.

1398
01:18:21.130 --> 01:18:22.531
- Honey. I promise.

1399
01:18:22.665 --> 01:18:24.734
I don't know why you're
acting like this.

1400
01:18:25.568 --> 01:18:27.670
Honey. it's awesome.

1401
01:18:27.804 --> 01:18:29.672
Don't worry about
anything. Jonah.

1402
01:18:29.806 --> 01:18:31.540
- No matter what. I'll be here.

1403
01:18:31.674 --> 01:18:33.376
I don't want to miss it.

1404
01:18:34.343 --> 01:18:36.813
- Stop worrying about
everything. it's okay.

1405
01:18:38.314 --> 01:18:39.849
- We're a family.

1406
01:18:39.983 --> 01:18:43.086
- Aw. yeah. we are.

1407
01:18:44.687 --> 01:18:47.824
Jonah. I know a mother's not
supposed to have favorites.

1408
01:18:47.957 --> 01:18:50.359
but you've always been mine.

1409
01:18:50.493 --> 01:18:51.594
I love you. baby.

1410
01:18:51.727 --> 01:18:53.863
- Love you too. Mom.
- Okay.

1411
01:18:53.997 --> 01:18:55.731
(both laughing)

1412
01:18:55.865 --> 01:18:57.066
See you tomorrow.

1413
01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:59.402
Come on. let's go to sleep.
- Night.

1414
01:18:59.535 --> 01:19:01.370
- Family.

1415
01:19:01.504 --> 01:19:04.107
- [Jonah] Family. motherfucker.

1416
01:19:07.777 --> 01:19:08.744
- Bring it.

1417
01:19:09.879 --> 01:19:10.814
- I know.

1418
01:19:10.947 --> 01:19:14.750
(ominous instrumental music)

1419
01:19:21.224 --> 01:19:25.829
(ominous instrumental
music continues)

1420
01:19:26.930 --> 01:19:30.633
(upbeat instrumental music)

1421
01:19:33.937 --> 01:19:38.975
(people chattering)
(people laughing)

1422
01:19:43.012 --> 01:19:46.782
(upbeat instrumental
music continues)

1423
01:19:46.916 --> 01:19:49.752
(people cheering)

1424
01:19:55.691 --> 01:20:00.196
(upbeat instrumental
music continues)

1425
01:20:04.733 --> 01:20:09.205
(upbeat instrumental
music continues)

1426
01:20:13.176 --> 01:20:17.713
(upbeat instrumental
music continues)

1427
01:20:17.847 --> 01:20:19.548
- Big man.

1428
01:20:19.682 --> 01:20:21.885
So what's this I hear about
you getting cozy with Jonah?

1429
01:20:22.018 --> 01:20:23.386
- None of your business.

1430
01:20:23.519 --> 01:20:25.688
- What you asking us
some shit like that for?

1431
01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:29.292
- I don't mean no disrespect
that's just what I heard.

1432
01:20:29.425 --> 01:20:30.526
- Wrong question.
- Man. get you're ass

1433
01:20:30.659 --> 01:20:32.328
out of here.

1434
01:20:33.462 --> 01:20:35.598
What you still doing
standing there?

1435
01:20:36.499 --> 01:20:38.167
Get outta here.
- Ladies.

1436
01:20:39.335 --> 01:20:41.204
- Can you believe
this motherfucker?

1437
01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:46.209
- Hey can we get
on with this shit?

1438
01:20:46.342 --> 01:20:47.310
- I told you nothing happens.

1439
01:20:47.443 --> 01:20:49.178
until the little prick shows up.

1440
01:20:49.312 --> 01:20:52.381
- I still want to gouge that
motherfucker's eyes out.

1441
01:20:52.515 --> 01:20:54.817
- Yeah. well. you
may get your chance.

1442
01:20:54.951 --> 01:20:57.020
For now. just stay calm.

1443
01:20:57.153 --> 01:20:58.521
Ignore everybody here.

1444
01:20:59.622 --> 01:21:00.623
I think he's bluffing.

1445
01:21:00.756 --> 01:21:02.191
- And what if he's not?

1446
01:21:06.362 --> 01:21:07.430
- We got it anyway.

1447
01:21:08.531 --> 01:21:09.398
- Got what?

1448
01:21:10.666 --> 01:21:12.035
- Chicken wings.

1449
01:21:12.168 --> 01:21:13.269
Get ready.

1450
01:21:16.872 --> 01:21:17.907
- It's time to eat.

1451
01:21:19.542 --> 01:21:21.844
- Isa.
- Oh. Ken. you came.

1452
01:21:22.645 --> 01:21:24.013
- How are you feeling?

1453
01:21:24.147 --> 01:21:25.514
- Honestly? Better than ever.

1454
01:21:25.648 --> 01:21:27.216
- That makes me feel so good.

1455
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:29.718
Listen. is there some place you.

1456
01:21:29.852 --> 01:21:31.587
and I can talk in private?

1457
01:21:33.322 --> 01:21:35.258
- Well. we can
talk in the house.

1458
01:21:35.391 --> 01:21:37.426
What is it. is it about work?

1459
01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:39.028
- It's business-related.

1460
01:21:39.162 --> 01:21:40.496
I just have something
to talk to you about.

1461
01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:42.098
It's really-

1462
01:21:42.231 --> 01:21:43.599
- May I have this dance?

1463
01:21:43.732 --> 01:21:44.533
- I don't hear any music.

1464
01:21:44.667 --> 01:21:45.734
- Well. let's make some.

1465
01:21:45.868 --> 01:21:47.270
(Isa laughing)

1466
01:21:47.403 --> 01:21:48.904
- You see why I like
him. this man's nice.

1467
01:21:49.038 --> 01:21:50.073
- So romantic.

1468
01:21:50.206 --> 01:21:52.375
- [Isa] He is romantic.

1469
01:21:53.509 --> 01:21:55.111
- What's up. Doc?
- Zane.

1470
01:21:55.244 --> 01:21:56.912
- [Zane] Thanks for coming.

1471
01:21:57.046 --> 01:21:59.915
- I wouldn't miss a
moment like this. would I?

1472
01:22:00.049 --> 01:22:05.088
I've known you guys. well Isa.
for a very. very long time

1473
01:22:07.290 --> 01:22:08.824
- Okay. what did
you want to say.

1474
01:22:08.958 --> 01:22:10.326
before the man of the hour
rudely interrupted us?

1475
01:22:10.459 --> 01:22:11.560
- Oh you're blaming me now?

1476
01:22:11.694 --> 01:22:13.496
- I blame you for everything.

1477
01:22:13.629 --> 01:22:15.564
Everything that happens you're
gonna be in trouble for it.

1478
01:22:15.698 --> 01:22:16.499
(all laughing)

1479
01:22:16.632 --> 01:22:17.666
- What did I get into?

1480
01:22:18.901 --> 01:22:20.970
- Okay. but really.
what is it Kenny?

1481
01:22:23.306 --> 01:22:24.807
- Yeah. I think your
mouth was moving.

1482
01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:26.742
and something was trying
to come out but I don't

1483
01:22:26.875 --> 01:22:28.311
know what it was.

1484
01:22:32.615 --> 01:22:35.151
(both laughing)

1485
01:22:35.284 --> 01:22:36.952
- I just wanted to
check in on you.

1486
01:22:37.086 --> 01:22:38.487
Yeah. that's all.

1487
01:22:38.621 --> 01:22:39.722
And I can see you're
perfectly back to normal.

1488
01:22:39.855 --> 01:22:41.490
Right?
- Yes. I feel great.

1489
01:22:41.624 --> 01:22:43.292
- Great. it's okay.

1490
01:22:44.527 --> 01:22:45.894
I don't know why I
made such a big deal

1491
01:22:46.029 --> 01:22:47.296
out of saying that.

1492
01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:50.066
(all laughing)

1493
01:22:50.199 --> 01:22:51.000
Oh. man.

1494
01:22:51.934 --> 01:22:53.402
- I don't know what's going on.

1495
01:22:53.536 --> 01:22:57.306
- [Kenny] Oh. I'm so glad
you're feeling better.

1496
01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:59.242
- Oh. look who it is.

1497
01:23:00.476 --> 01:23:02.078
- Oh. Jonah. dear.

1498
01:23:02.211 --> 01:23:03.312
Oh. go get him. okay?

1499
01:23:03.446 --> 01:23:04.847
- It's almost time.
- Yeah.

1500
01:23:10.519 --> 01:23:13.222
(Zane scoffing)

1501
01:23:13.356 --> 01:23:15.291
- I don't know why
he's acting like that.

1502
01:23:15.424 --> 01:23:16.725
He's acting a little crazy.

1503
01:23:16.859 --> 01:23:18.027
He must just be
nervous or something.

1504
01:23:18.161 --> 01:23:19.828
- Must be. yeah.

1505
01:23:19.962 --> 01:23:20.829
- Excuse me.

1506
01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:25.468
- I bet.

1507
01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:32.475
- Jonah. there he
is. glad you made it.

1508
01:23:35.344 --> 01:23:37.913
- I've got nothing
to say to you.

1509
01:23:38.047 --> 01:23:39.648
- Fair enough.

1510
01:23:39.782 --> 01:23:42.985
Whatever it is you're
thinking about doing. don't.

1511
01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:47.690
It's not worth it. son.

1512
01:23:52.295 --> 01:23:55.964
Whatever you think you
know. you don't know shit.

1513
01:23:57.966 --> 01:24:00.035
It's a mistake.

1514
01:24:00.169 --> 01:24:02.371
You know what we
do with mistakes?

1515
01:24:02.505 --> 01:24:04.640
We make mistakes.
and we move on.

1516
01:24:05.974 --> 01:24:09.044
(laughs) Look at your mother.

1517
01:24:10.513 --> 01:24:14.883
She's happy. I'm
happy. end of story.

1518
01:24:19.388 --> 01:24:21.890
- You can't take back
what you've already done.

1519
01:24:29.265 --> 01:24:32.535
- Hey. baby. where
you been. huh?

1520
01:24:32.668 --> 01:24:35.438
- Do you think I'm stupid?
- What?

1521
01:24:35.571 --> 01:24:37.706
- You were in on
it the whole time.

1522
01:24:39.575 --> 01:24:41.844
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

1523
01:24:42.878 --> 01:24:45.281
- And you weren't even
that good of a fuck.

1524
01:24:47.049 --> 01:24:49.585
Stay the hell away
from me and my family.

1525
01:24:50.886 --> 01:24:53.922
(people chattering)

1526
01:24:59.395 --> 01:25:00.796
(people continue chattering)

1527
01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:02.798
- Everybody gather.

1528
01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:05.033
I know this was
very short notice

1529
01:25:05.168 --> 01:25:07.102
so a lot of people
couldn't make it.

1530
01:25:07.236 --> 01:25:08.204
Thank you to those
who showed up.

1531
01:25:08.337 --> 01:25:10.606
It shows a lot of respect.

1532
01:25:10.739 --> 01:25:12.408
Now if only you
could have showed

1533
01:25:12.541 --> 01:25:13.842
up to your jobs on time when
I was actually doing this.

1534
01:25:13.976 --> 01:25:17.246
(everyone laughing)

1535
01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:20.783
About a month ago. I
came to the realization

1536
01:25:20.916 --> 01:25:22.818
it was time to pass the torch.

1537
01:25:24.119 --> 01:25:27.022
and I can't think of anyone
more deserving than Zane.

1538
01:25:28.123 --> 01:25:30.125
He walked into my life
a couple years ago.

1539
01:25:30.259 --> 01:25:32.361
and proved to me that not
all men deserve a bullet

1540
01:25:32.495 --> 01:25:34.463
between the eyes.
(everyone laughing)

1541
01:25:34.597 --> 01:25:35.964
Come up here. baby.

1542
01:25:40.236 --> 01:25:42.838
I'm not just giving
you my contacts today.

1543
01:25:43.772 --> 01:25:47.075
I'm giving you my
trust and my blessings.

1544
01:25:48.911 --> 01:25:50.679
because I love you.

1545
01:25:50.813 --> 01:25:51.947
- I love you.

1546
01:25:55.218 --> 01:25:56.185
- [Crowd] Aw.

1547
01:25:56.319 --> 01:25:59.121
(crowd cheering)

1548
01:26:01.457 --> 01:26:03.326
- [Zane] What the fuck is that?

1549
01:26:03.459 --> 01:26:05.027
- That's what got you sick. Mom.

1550
01:26:06.094 --> 01:26:07.796
Only it was meant to kill you.

1551
01:26:07.930 --> 01:26:10.533
and the guy right next to
you is the one who did it.

1552
01:26:12.901 --> 01:26:15.904
- See this is why
bars card minors.

1553
01:26:16.038 --> 01:26:18.374
Maybe you should lay
off the adult beverages.

1554
01:26:18.507 --> 01:26:20.543
Mickey. Franklin. why
don't you take Jonah

1555
01:26:20.676 --> 01:26:21.844
out front and give
him some fresh air?

1556
01:26:21.977 --> 01:26:23.879
- Don't you touch my son.

1557
01:26:24.012 --> 01:26:27.816
(intense instrumental music)

1558
01:26:33.489 --> 01:26:34.523
- Is this true?

1559
01:26:35.658 --> 01:26:36.525
- No.

1560
01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:38.894
Come on. they're
on fucking drugs.

1561
01:26:39.027 --> 01:26:41.029
They're out of
their fucking minds.

1562
01:26:42.531 --> 01:26:45.000
- You know. I knew you'd
say something like that.

1563
01:26:45.133 --> 01:26:46.902
So don't even take
my word for it.

1564
01:26:47.035 --> 01:26:48.003
Ask Kenny.

1565
01:26:49.037 --> 01:26:50.373
Kenny. was that the
drug that was used

1566
01:26:50.506 --> 01:26:52.241
to try to take out my mom?

1567
01:26:58.046 --> 01:26:58.914
- It was.

1568
01:27:01.317 --> 01:27:02.751
- Come on. you gonna believe

1569
01:27:02.885 --> 01:27:05.354
some fucking pill-popping
doctor feel-good. huh?

1570
01:27:06.555 --> 01:27:07.256
They're framing me!

1571
01:27:07.390 --> 01:27:08.324
They're jealous.

1572
01:27:08.457 --> 01:27:10.058
This is envy.

1573
01:27:10.192 --> 01:27:13.028
- All you ever wanted. was
to take over the business.

1574
01:27:13.161 --> 01:27:14.763
That was your plan
the whole time.

1575
01:27:14.897 --> 01:27:17.400
You tried to flip the
switch. and it almost worked.

1576
01:27:18.934 --> 01:27:20.569
And then you tried to use me.

1577
01:27:22.170 --> 01:27:23.872
You even had your
own sister fuck me

1578
01:27:24.006 --> 01:27:26.542
to try to get me to endorse you.

1579
01:27:26.675 --> 01:27:30.045
It was a good fucking
try. I'll give you that.

1580
01:27:30.178 --> 01:27:34.383
But you're not family. and
you never fucking will be.

1581
01:27:38.354 --> 01:27:41.123
I'll let my mom decide what
she's gonna do with you now.

1582
01:27:42.124 --> 01:27:44.126
but you're not getting
shit she's built.

1583
01:27:46.128 --> 01:27:47.062
You're finished.

1584
01:27:48.263 --> 01:27:50.533
- Honey. listen to
me. this isn't true.

1585
01:27:50.666 --> 01:27:53.101
I would never do this.
you gotta believe me.

1586
01:27:53.235 --> 01:27:55.037
Please. you're my wife.

1587
01:27:55.170 --> 01:27:56.639
I would never do this.

1588
01:27:56.772 --> 01:28:00.208
- I'm not your fucking
wife. you bastard!

1589
01:28:00.343 --> 01:28:03.045
Get the fuck out of my house!

1590
01:28:05.848 --> 01:28:08.884
- You're fucking
crazy. all of you!

1591
01:28:09.017 --> 01:28:11.454
You don't even know
what you're losing.

1592
01:28:15.791 --> 01:28:17.593
- Get the fuck out of here.

1593
01:28:18.927 --> 01:28:22.431
- When I said to
drop it. I meant it.

1594
01:28:24.733 --> 01:28:26.134
Kill 'em all!
