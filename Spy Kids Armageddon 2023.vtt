Our restrictions make them
do what is right.

127
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:40.208
so if we ban all of their tech.
maybe they should behave even better.

technology isn't doing them any favors.

00:11:15.291 --> 00:11:17.833
[kid's mom] Sweetie. wait up.
Wait a minute.

177
00:11:18.666 --> 00:11:20.000
What's Hyskor?

178
00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:21.666
I…

179
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:25.208
[host] This is the final round
of our trading-card tournament.

180
00:11:25.291 --> 00:11:29.333
The winner will receive
a free copy of Hyskor.

181
00:11:29.416 --> 00:11:34.708
which. of course. is the sequel
to the megahit video game Loskor.

182
00:11:34.791 --> 00:11:36.375
Players. are you ready?

183
00:11:37.541 --> 00:11:38.625
[host] Let's play.

184
00:11:39.541 --> 00:11:40.958
Lowest number wins.

185
00:11:41.041 --> 00:11:42.166
Beat that.

186
00:11:44.541 --> 00:11:46.208
Oh no.

187
00:11:47.166 --> 00:11:48.875
Or. as Rat Thickskull would say.

188
00:11:50.916 --> 00:11:52.375
"Tough tacos. kid."

189
00:11:52.458 --> 00:11:54.583
[cheering]

190
00:11:59.208 --> 00:12:00.416
I'm impressed.

191
00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.166
Congratulations. Tony.

192
00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:08.000
Type in your email and Hyskor will be sent
to your home computer.

193
00:12:10.166 --> 00:12:12.000
Did you know the creator of Hyskor

194
00:12:12.083 --> 00:12:15.666
is this crazy awesome rich guy
named Rey Kingston.

195
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:18.375
but everyone calls him
by his gamer name. the King.

196
00:12:18.458 --> 00:12:19.333
Check it out.

197
00:12:19.416 --> 00:12:22.875
[narrator] And here is Rey Kingston
to talk about how he does it.

198
00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.875
My latest game. Hyskor.

199
00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:28.333
is made using
my new. flawless design method.

200
00:12:28.416 --> 00:12:30.208
That's a glitch right there.

201
00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:31.708
[laughter]

202
00:12:31.791 --> 00:12:34.208
But. using my proprietary…

203
00:12:34.291 --> 00:12:36.250
[computerized voice] VR pods.

204
00:12:36.333 --> 00:12:39.875
…I'm able to design and improve the game

205
00:12:40.708 --> 00:12:41.958
from the inside.

206
00:12:42.041 --> 00:12:43.291
Whoa.

207
00:12:43.916 --> 00:12:45.750
-With my mind.
-[bleeping]

208
00:12:45.833 --> 00:12:47.250
What?

209
00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:51.166
[The King] I can make my game better
so it can make you better.

210
00:12:53.833 --> 00:12:55.166
Will you look at that?

211
00:12:56.125 --> 00:12:58.708
-Better than ever!
-[kids] Whoa!

212
00:12:58.791 --> 00:13:01.375
And when you apply game theory.

213
00:13:02.625 --> 00:13:04.041
you can fix anything.

214
00:13:04.791 --> 00:13:06.500
[kids laugh]

215
00:13:07.375 --> 00:13:11.166
Do you think the game will have
the mythical One Hit from Loskor?

216
00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:12.958
No. One Hit is a fable.

217
00:13:13.041 --> 00:13:16.041
No. it isn't. Leebs and I
were fighting a cheating player.

218
00:13:16.125 --> 00:13:20.333
and I ran out of health.
but then I got a gold star.

219
00:13:20.416 --> 00:13:24.791
came back to life.
and beat the player with One Hit.

220
00:13:24.875 --> 00:13:26.333
That's impossible. Patty.

221
00:13:26.416 --> 00:13:30.041
Hyskor's releasing at midnight.
and I'm gonna play it all night long.

222
00:13:30.125 --> 00:13:33.041
My parents would never let me
stay up that late.

223
00:13:33.125 --> 00:13:36.083
We're not allowed
to stay up late playing games.

224
00:13:36.166 --> 00:13:39.083
You'll never make it past
Mom and Dad's restrictions.

225
00:13:39.166 --> 00:13:40.625
Not without your help.

226
00:13:41.875 --> 00:13:44.833
-You shouldn't have cheated.
-But I won. didn't I?

227
00:13:44.916 --> 00:13:46.625
There's a better way to win.

228
00:13:46.708 --> 00:13:49.708
But I got Hyskor.
I know you wanna play too.

229
00:13:50.916 --> 00:13:52.916
[ominous music playing]

230
00:13:54.833 --> 00:13:56.833
[Heck Knight growls]

231
00:14:01.375 --> 00:14:04.791
[The King] The world is full
of terrible. unfair people.

232
00:14:04.875 --> 00:14:09.416
but. with the Armageddon Code.
I can force them all to become good.

233
00:14:14.083 --> 00:14:16.916
[Heck Knight] We were unable
to trace the Armageddon Code

234
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.750
through the agent's watch.

235
00:14:18.833 --> 00:14:20.583
But I've learned what I needed.

236
00:14:21.083 --> 00:14:22.916
The Torrezes have the code.

237
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.875
Since it wasn't in the OSS.
it must be at their home.

238
00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:29.833
[Heck Knight] I will invade their home
and claim the code for you.

239
00:14:30.375 --> 00:14:31.250
No need.

240
00:14:32.375 --> 00:14:35.916
The Torrezes just won a copy of Hyskor.

241
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.625
Tonight. I'll claim the code myself.

242
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:41.333
[music builds. fades]

243
00:14:41.416 --> 00:14:43.416
[floorboards creak]

244
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.333
Wha… It's… It's a brand-new house.
Why are the floors squeaking?!

245
00:14:48.416 --> 00:14:51.791
[Torrez] We picked this place
for how it looks. not how it sounds.

246
00:14:51.875 --> 00:14:54.125
No way this is gonna work.

247
00:14:54.625 --> 00:14:56.875
Five minutes to midnight. Let's move.

248
00:14:59.416 --> 00:15:01.333
-[creaking]
-[inhales sharply]

249
00:15:01.416 --> 00:15:04.166
How are we getting past
the squeaky wood floor?

250
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:06.666
I tried mapping where all the squeaks are

251
00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:09.583
so that we can sneak past
Mom and Dad's office

252
00:15:09.666 --> 00:15:11.083
and get to the game room.

253
00:15:14.916 --> 00:15:17.750
But one creak and we're goners.

254
00:15:26.375 --> 00:15:28.625
-Wait for me!
-Sh!

255
00:15:28.708 --> 00:15:30.541
[Patty] One. two. three!

256
00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:33.041
I feel like a spy.

257
00:15:33.125 --> 00:15:35.458
The worst spy ever. You talk too loud.

258
00:15:38.458 --> 00:15:40.125

259

-Your map is wrong!
-It's not wrong.

263
00:16:00.833 --> 00:16:02.916
-[Patty] Here. give me that.
-[both gasp]

264

[music fades]

267
00:16:24.083 --> 00:16:25.750
[Tony] Worst spy ever.

268
00:16:25.833 --> 00:16:27.875
-[Patty] Worst idea ever.
-[TVs chime]

269
00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:29.583
We're gonna get so busted.

270
00:16:31.375 --> 00:16:34.000
[Tony] Dad changes his passcode every day.

271
00:16:34.083 --> 00:16:37.666
-What now?
-I found this in his desk earlier.

272
00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:39.375
[Patty] You have no soul.

273
00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:45.583
Hyskor's downloading. Now we wait.

274
00:16:48.583 --> 00:16:51.291
We are dealing with
a highly intelligent enemy

275
00:16:51.375 --> 00:16:53.333
who knows about the Armageddon Code.

276
00:16:53.416 --> 00:16:55.291
It's time we consider deleting it.

277
00:16:55.375 --> 00:16:56.583
Out of the question.

278
00:16:56.666 --> 00:16:59.625
The code can break into any device
on the planet.

279
00:16:59.708 --> 00:17:01.625
Yes. Yes. He's right. babe.

280
00:17:01.708 --> 00:17:04.333
Think of the times we've used it
to save the world.

281
00:17:04.416 --> 00:17:05.791
This is our greatest tool.

282
00:17:05.875 --> 00:17:09.083
It's also the world's greatest threat.

283
00:17:09.166 --> 00:17:12.041
If there was the slightest chance
of someone taking it.

284
00:17:12.125 --> 00:17:14.375
we agreed we would erase it.

285
00:17:14.458 --> 00:17:18.791
Your orders are to protect the code
until we find a solution. No exceptions.

286
00:17:21.875 --> 00:17:23.041
What? He's right.

287
00:17:24.708 --> 00:17:26.333
Do not look at me like that.

288
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:28.833
Or like that.

289
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.083
That's not so bad.

Download complete. Get ready
for the ultimate game experience.

291
00:17:35.791 --> 00:17:40.375
What if using Dad's passcode
opens up some kind of reverse access

292
00:17:40.458 --> 00:17:43.333
where someone can break into our system?

293
00:17:43.416 --> 00:17:46.625
Do you wanna play or not?
One button-press away.

294
00:17:47.791 --> 00:17:50.125
[whispers] We'll be in so much trouble.

295
00:17:50.208 --> 00:17:51.833

-Okay. do it. Wait. Don't do it.

[game] Welcome to Hyskor.

298
00:18:01.625 --> 00:18:03.541
Reach the end of the world

299

and defeat the last player standing
to win the crown.

00:18:07.833 --> 00:18:10.083
-Choose your character.
-I pick Florella.

-You're playing her still?
-But she's so cool.

302
00:18:12.583 --> 00:18:14.583
She gets better
as you work through the game.

303
00:18:14.666 --> 00:18:17.541
-I would've won by then.
-With Rat Thickskull?

304
00:18:17.625 --> 00:18:18.875
Good luck. He's a jerk.

305
00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:23.625
No. He's the most ruthless. scheming.
roguish rascal in the whole game.

306
00:18:23.708 --> 00:18:26.458
And no one plays him better than I do.

307
00:18:26.541 --> 00:18:28.416
Okay. we. uh… We…

308
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:32.625
-We move the code. We hide it.
-It's a threat no matter where we hide it.

It's always been that way.
ever since you created it.

-We need to delete it now. Terrence.
-No. N…

No. we just keep all home devices
locked under maximum security.

313

People are always
going to be after the code.

our kids' lives forever?

00:29:27.875 --> 00:29:29.875
[engine revs]

521
00:29:43.291 --> 00:29:44.833
We did something wrong.

522
00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:47.666
This can't be it.

523
00:29:48.791 --> 00:29:53.291
[Tony] So Mom and Dad are spies.
and they sent us to the middle of nowhere?

524
00:29:53.375 --> 00:29:56.416
-[Tony] This must be a joke.
-[Patty] Then why am I not laughing?

525
00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:01.458
[Patty] The water is so nice… and brown.

526
00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:06.833
[Tony] Maybe we jump in.

527
00:30:06.916 --> 00:30:08.125
[Patty] After you.

528
00:30:08.208 --> 00:30:10.250
[electronic voice] Your name?

529
00:30:10.333 --> 00:30:12.125
Uh. Patty Torrez.

530
00:30:12.208 --> 00:30:13.375
Tony Torrez.

531
00:30:13.458 --> 00:30:14.958
Your full name. please.

532
00:30:15.041 --> 00:30:17.916
Uh. Patty Tango-Torrez?

533
00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:21.541
My dad's last name is Tango.
and my mom's is Torrez.

534
00:30:22.125 --> 00:30:24.625
-Your full name.
-We never use our full names.

535
00:30:24.708 --> 00:30:25.791
They're too long.

536
00:30:25.875 --> 00:30:27.458
Your full name. please.

537
00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:33.041
Patricia Angelita Sorrow
Feliz Rhiannon Tango-Torrez.

538
00:30:33.125 --> 00:30:37.458
Antonio Joaquin Cecilio
Rogue Amadeus Tango-Torrez.

539
00:30:37.541 --> 00:30:40.375
-[bleeping]
-[Patty] The safe house is underwater?

540
00:30:40.458 --> 00:30:42.250
[Tony] Either that or it drowned.

541
00:30:44.791 --> 00:30:46.500
-[clunking]
-[elevator dings]

542
00:30:50.625 --> 00:30:51.791
Yoo-hoo!

543
00:30:53.708 --> 00:30:55.041
It's empty.

544
00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.458
[Tony] This place is a dump.

545
00:31:03.541 --> 00:31:04.458
[high-pitched hum]

546
00:31:04.541 --> 00:31:06.125
-[both gasp]
-Hey. kiddos.

547
00:31:06.208 --> 00:31:09.791
We couldn't wait to show you
the safe house when you were old enough.

548
00:31:10.291 --> 00:31:13.666
If you're here now and by yourselves.

549
00:31:14.208 --> 00:31:16.625
that means
something has gone terribly wrong.

550
00:31:18.208 --> 00:31:21.375
But don't you worry.
Mom and Dad are very close.

551
00:31:21.458 --> 00:31:23.375
And if you haven't guessed yet.

552
00:31:24.125 --> 00:31:26.916
your father and I are spies.

553
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.041
[clunking]

554
00:31:29.875 --> 00:31:31.250
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

555
00:31:32.458 --> 00:31:35.666
Hopefully. we will see you soon
so we can explain everything.

556
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:36.916
In the meantime.

557
00:31:38.833 --> 00:31:40.333
choose your activity.

558
00:31:40.416 --> 00:31:42.208
There's comfort for sleep…

559
00:31:43.333 --> 00:31:46.541
[both] Whoa!

560
00:31:46.625 --> 00:31:49.750
-Cozy beds!
-I get the top bunk.

561
00:31:51.083 --> 00:31:52.583
…food for nourishment…

562
00:31:55.041 --> 00:31:57.500
A little kitchen and snacks.

563
00:31:58.583 --> 00:32:01.291
…gadget tutorials for a competitive edge…

564
00:32:02.166 --> 00:32:04.750
[both] Whoa!

565
00:32:04.833 --> 00:32:07.000
[Patty] Spy gadgets!

566
00:32:07.083 --> 00:32:10.083
This place is amazing!

567
00:32:10.166 --> 00:32:13.166
…and spy training modules
for self-defense.

568
00:32:13.666 --> 00:32:15.375
-[Terrence] Stand here.
-Spy training!

569
00:32:17.583 --> 00:32:19.708
-I'm gonna be the best spy ever.
-[beep]

570
00:32:19.791 --> 00:32:21.250
-[clunking]
-[Tony] Ah!

571
00:32:22.208 --> 00:32:23.208
Tony!

572
00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:25.666
Hello.

573
00:32:26.333 --> 00:32:29.750
-Move over. I'm coming down.
-[Terrence] Lesson one complete.

574
00:32:29.833 --> 00:32:31.500
Always look out for traps.

575
00:32:32.166 --> 00:32:33.541
[Tony] Look at this place.

576
00:32:33.625 --> 00:32:35.708
[Terrence] Lesson two. ambush.

577
00:32:35.791 --> 00:32:37.208
"Ambush Alley."

578
00:32:38.791 --> 00:32:39.750
This is easy.

579
00:32:41.666 --> 00:32:43.250
Just like a video game.

580
00:32:48.375 --> 00:32:49.625
Hee-hee. You did it!

581
00:32:50.541 --> 00:32:51.541
[Tony] Ah!

582
00:32:52.708 --> 00:32:53.666
Oh.

583
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:55.541
[Terrence] Almost good.

584
00:32:55.625 --> 00:32:56.833
[chuckles]

585
00:32:56.916 --> 00:32:59.000
I'm gonna try this one.

586
00:32:59.083 --> 00:33:01.708
Avoid the lasers or you'll trip the alarm.

587
00:33:03.291 --> 00:33:05.041
Okay. Your turn.

588
00:33:05.125 --> 00:33:06.208
[beeping. whirring]

589
00:33:06.291 --> 00:33:07.125
-[grunts]
-Failure!

590
00:33:07.208 --> 00:33:08.166
[chuckles]

591
00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:09.291
Please try again.

592
00:33:10.458 --> 00:33:12.000
-[beeping]
-[Tony] Oof!

593
00:33:12.083 --> 00:33:12.916
Failure.

594
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.666
How come when you mess up. I get hit?

595
00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:18.041
Um… because we're a team?

596
00:33:18.125 --> 00:33:19.458
Let me try.

597
00:33:26.583 --> 00:33:27.458
Failure.

598
00:33:27.541 --> 00:33:29.375
Smart training system.

599
00:33:29.958 --> 00:33:32.583
-Let's go upstairs and do gadgets.
-Okay.

600
00:33:34.875 --> 00:33:36.875
[tense music playing]

601
00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.041
[dramatic music playing]

602
00:33:47.458 --> 00:33:49.375
[rattling]

603
00:34:02.625 --> 00:34:04.833
-Let's find a way out.
-[groans]

604
00:34:04.916 --> 00:34:06.958
Oh. did they hurt you. my love?

605
00:34:07.041 --> 00:34:09.208
No. No. no. no. They didn't.

606
00:34:09.291 --> 00:34:12.250
The sleeper kiss is
what leaves the lingering pain.

607
00:34:12.333 --> 00:34:13.750
I had to delete it.

608
00:34:13.833 --> 00:34:16.375
-I know.
-Okay. Then let's break outta here.

609
00:34:17.666 --> 00:34:18.583
Ah. oh.

610
00:34:18.666 --> 00:34:19.916
-[clunking]
-Oh.

611
00:34:20.791 --> 00:34:23.583
-Oh.
-I'm gonna say that's a trap.

612
00:34:23.666 --> 00:34:26.500
At least we get to meet
whoever's behind this. Come on.

613
00:34:26.583 --> 00:34:28.333
-So you're just gonna--
-Come on!

614
00:34:28.916 --> 00:34:32.125
I'm sure they're gonna let us
waltz right into where they are.

615
00:34:34.708 --> 00:34:36.166
This is why we get in trouble.

616
00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:38.083
-You're impulsive.
-Just stay close.

617
00:34:38.166 --> 00:34:40.541
I am just asking you
to use a little caution.

618
00:34:40.625 --> 00:34:41.708
Stay close.

619
00:34:42.708 --> 00:34:43.916
[Terrence] Come on.

620
00:34:45.708 --> 00:34:47.375
-[Nora] Hear that?
-Yeah.

621
00:34:47.458 --> 00:34:48.458
One. two. three.

622
00:34:53.291 --> 00:34:54.208
Whoa.

623
00:34:55.666 --> 00:34:57.166
-That's ominous.
-Yeah.

624
00:34:58.541 --> 00:35:01.000
-[Terrence] Very interesting.
-[Torrez] Uh-huh.

625
00:35:03.208 --> 00:35:05.208
[bricks scraping]

626
00:35:05.875 --> 00:35:06.791
[Torrez] Oh.

627
00:35:07.875 --> 00:35:08.750
Hi.

628
00:35:09.333 --> 00:35:11.125
Uh. excuse our appearance.

629
00:35:11.208 --> 00:35:13.708
We didn't realize
it was Fantasy Friday here.

630
00:35:14.416 --> 00:35:19.000
[Terrence] Nice architecture. by the way.
Very. uh… retro video gamey.

631
00:35:19.083 --> 00:35:21.083
[laughs]

632
00:35:23.166 --> 00:35:25.166
As far as I'm concerned.

633
00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:28.833
the late 20th century was the height

634
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:33.250
of visual technology.

635
00:35:36.416 --> 00:35:38.250
It was all downhill from there.

636
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:41.500
Please sit down.

637
00:35:41.583 --> 00:35:42.916
Oh. there…

638
00:35:48.375 --> 00:35:49.333
Oh.

639
00:35:50.166 --> 00:35:51.000
Trust me.

640
00:35:51.083 --> 00:35:53.083
[suspenseful music playing]

641
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:02.833
Oh.

642
00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:07.333
So. Rey Kingston.

643
00:36:07.416 --> 00:36:11.250
one of the most powerful tech giants
in all of history.

644
00:36:11.958 --> 00:36:16.291
using a virus to force everyone
to play video games. Why?

645
00:36:16.375 --> 00:36:18.958
Well. the only true benefit
in gaining power

646
00:36:19.041 --> 00:36:20.458
is to influence the world.

647
00:36:20.541 --> 00:36:24.000
There's no better way to do that
than through your Armageddon Code.

648
00:36:24.083 --> 00:36:27.166
And you shut off
half the world with it. Happy?

649
00:36:28.041 --> 00:36:29.833
No. I'm not.

650
00:36:31.125 --> 00:36:33.333
Yeah. Armageddon
was supposed to allow Hyskor

651
00:36:33.416 --> 00:36:37.000
to break into every device on the planet.

652
00:36:37.791 --> 00:36:41.791
So why has it stopped halfway?

653
00:36:43.208 --> 00:36:45.708
-Try turning it off and back on?
-That works.

654
00:36:45.791 --> 00:36:47.458
[Torrez] Maybe just give it a smack.

655
00:36:48.416 --> 00:36:50.625
Take it out… [blows] …right back in.

656
00:36:52.125 --> 00:36:56.000
-You're not gonna help me fix it. are you?
-Not a chance.

657
00:36:57.291 --> 00:36:58.208
Ah…

658
00:36:58.833 --> 00:37:00.208
There's other ways.

659
00:37:01.375 --> 00:37:02.708
For the longest time.

660
00:37:02.791 --> 00:37:06.833
I've wanted to challenge both of you
to a duel.

661
00:37:07.958 --> 00:37:10.833
-Why us?
-I mean. are we that good?

662
00:37:10.916 --> 00:37:11.833
No.

663
00:37:13.208 --> 00:37:14.750
You're not good at all.

664
00:37:17.625 --> 00:37:20.208
If you win. you go free.

665
00:37:21.041 --> 00:37:21.916
[blades swoosh]

666
00:37:23.208 --> 00:37:25.041
If I win. you fix the code.

667
00:37:27.791 --> 00:37:28.791
Let's do this.

668
00:37:34.083 --> 00:37:35.708
[lively music playing]

669
00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:49.750
[Terrence grunts]

670
00:37:50.208 --> 00:37:52.083
[Torrez] Ah. ah… Ooh.

671
00:37:52.625 --> 00:37:53.541
Oh.

672
00:38:14.208 --> 00:38:15.250
Sorry.

673
00:38:18.041 --> 00:38:19.000
Babe!

674
00:38:19.833 --> 00:38:20.791
Ha-ha-ha.

675
00:38:20.875 --> 00:38:22.083
[grunting]

676
00:38:22.791 --> 00:38:25.541
The code I stole was complete.

677
00:38:28.541 --> 00:38:31.583
You must have split it
the moment I took it from your home.

678
00:38:31.666 --> 00:38:32.875
Babe!

679
00:38:32.958 --> 00:38:38.208
Failsafe mechanism. huh? To ensure
it doesn't fall into the wrong hands?

680
00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:45.208
Wear this tracker
so that we can locate you.

681
00:38:45.833 --> 00:38:47.833
So if her necklace is a tracker…

682
00:38:50.125 --> 00:38:53.125
Your kids have
the missing piece. don't they?

683
00:38:54.125 --> 00:38:55.375
Stay away from my kids!

684
00:39:05.583 --> 00:39:07.208
-Careful!
-[Torrez panting]

685
00:39:07.708 --> 00:39:09.458
Is this all just a game to you?

686
00:39:10.833 --> 00:39:11.666
It is.

687
00:39:18.166 --> 00:39:20.708
And with game theory.
anything can be fixed.

688
00:39:20.791 --> 00:39:23.333
even this sorry world.

689
00:39:30.291 --> 00:39:33.541
Maybe your children will be
a little more helpful than you.

690
00:39:35.958 --> 00:39:36.958
Let's find out.

691
00:39:45.958 --> 00:39:47.916
[Patty] I get the top bunk now.

692
00:39:52.416 --> 00:39:54.041
Spy fashion!

693
00:39:55.166 --> 00:39:56.541
-[whirring]
-[gasps]

694
00:39:56.625 --> 00:39:59.291
[Patty] We have all the time in the world!

695
00:39:59.375 --> 00:40:02.583
Patty! It's a spy-suit generator.

696
00:40:03.375 --> 00:40:04.250
[Patty] Whoa!

697
00:40:04.333 --> 00:40:05.875
[Tony] I'm gonna try it.

713

It says it's a "thought bubble."

714
00:41:18.583 --> 00:41:20.333
Looks like you select an emotion

I just remembered something.

Mom told me that there was
something very important here.

723

but that it would find me.

This book is awesome.

735

Mom and Dad's job
is to lie and break the rules.

I don't care if it's their job.

737
00:42:53.375 --> 00:42:56.000
They tell us to be honest.
but they weren't with us.

738
00:42:56.083 --> 00:42:59.000
It proves that telling the truth
only gets you in trouble.

739
00:42:59.083 --> 00:43:02.791
That's crazy. Telling the truth
should never be a bad thing.

Since we caused this game apocalypse.
then we should fix it.

You mean take down the final boss?

No. I'm saying that we save Mom and Dad

and save the world.

He's definitely a spy.

ever wonders where all the spies are.

820
00:47:33.666 --> 00:47:37.166
And secrecy is how we protect the world
from our enemies.

00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:38.666
Now. come on. We're in a hurry.

822

[Patty] Well. maybe we wouldn't have
so many enemies

How do we find our parents?

828
00:47:53.125 --> 00:47:55.875
You got your vehicle working
and escaped your house.

829
00:47:55.958 --> 00:47:58.625
so we think
you two have what it takes to help.

830
00:47:58.708 --> 00:48:00.958
You want us to be real spies?

831
00:48:01.041 --> 00:48:02.291
Don't get carried away.

832
00:48:02.375 --> 00:48:06.208
I just want you to beat this video game
so we can access our systems.

Take off the kids' cuffs so they can do
what they do best. Play games.

-Okay. Get in there. kid.

We could never get past that part.
Wow. That is great. kid.

That is… That's great.

839

The system's back online.
Yeah. that's good work. kid.

849
00:48:55.666 --> 00:48:58.083
All right. Now we can
start searching for leads.

Let's go. people. I wanna see some names.

But only a piece of it?

855

Oh. Your parents were smart
to split the code.

856
00:49:28.208 --> 00:49:30.208
This gives us a fighting chance.

857
00:49:30.291 --> 00:49:33.083
What happens
if the bad guy gets both pieces?

858
00:49:33.166 --> 00:49:35.375
Your parents are
only authorized to use that piece.

859
00:49:35.458 --> 00:49:37.083
If the enemy combines them.

860
00:49:37.166 --> 00:49:40.625
he'd infect every device in the world
with his game virus.

861
00:49:40.708 --> 00:49:42.291
He'd be king of the planet.

862
00:49:44.958 --> 00:49:46.000
The King.

863
00:49:47.666 --> 00:49:50.583

The FBI already raided
his game studio this morning.

875
00:50:31.291 --> 00:50:34.333
but it was empty.
and this King was nowhere to be found.

876
00:50:34.416 --> 00:50:40.041
Well. in his games. he always hides
the bad guy in a cool. secret lair.

877
00:50:42.291 --> 00:50:45.000
People. how do we find him?
I want suggestions.

878
00:50:45.083 --> 00:50:49.375
Well. my mom gave me this to track us.

879
00:50:49.458 --> 00:50:53.625
So maybe we reverse-track her tracker?

880
00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:04.666
[beeping]

881
00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:07.000
That must be
where your parents are located.

882
00:51:07.083 --> 00:51:08.833
And quite possibly

883
00:51:09.458 --> 00:51:10.375
the King.

884
00:51:10.458 --> 00:51:12.458
[whirring]

885
00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:15.375
[power thunks]

886
00:51:15.458 --> 00:51:19.875
-Somebody else is in control.
-It means the bad guys are gonna break in.

887
00:51:20.375 --> 00:51:23.625
From there. there. and there.

888
00:51:23.708 --> 00:51:24.708
-What?
-Trust me.

889
00:51:24.791 --> 00:51:28.583
-We've learned from experience.
-Know how much money I pay for security?

890
00:51:28.666 --> 00:51:29.958
There's one!

891
00:51:30.041 --> 00:51:31.666
[frantic yelling]

892
00:51:33.791 --> 00:51:35.500
[Devlin] Get Armageddon out of here!

893
00:51:37.916 --> 00:51:39.000
Protect the code!

894
00:51:45.458 --> 00:51:48.791
Mom told us that we have to keep this safe
until she finds us.

895
00:51:50.166 --> 00:51:52.333
-[rock music playing]
-[zapping]

896
00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:55.583
Lasers.

897
00:51:55.666 --> 00:51:56.500
Ambush.

898
00:51:56.583 --> 00:51:57.458
[character grunts]

899
00:51:57.541 --> 00:51:58.375
Go!

900
00:52:05.791 --> 00:52:09.250
-Whoa! Did you see that?
-See what happens if you kick 'em.

901
00:52:12.916 --> 00:52:14.000
[groaning]

902
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:16.041
It did it again.

903
00:52:16.625 --> 00:52:17.833
[Devlin] Give me that!

904
00:52:17.916 --> 00:52:19.875
Let the grown-ups handle this.

905
00:52:24.833 --> 00:52:26.666
[Heck Knight] Give me the code.

906
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:27.833
[Devlin] Whoa!

907
00:52:35.541 --> 00:52:37.250
[Patty] They're getting away!

908
00:52:38.041 --> 00:52:42.666
-We need to find out where they're going.
-Bronson. we need eyes on the Heck Knight.

909
00:52:46.375 --> 00:52:48.750
Devlin! Get up and go chase them!

910
00:52:48.833 --> 00:52:49.750
You…

911
00:52:50.708 --> 00:52:52.750
-[clattering]
-[Patty] Ugh.

912
00:52:52.833 --> 00:52:55.750
The bad guys are escaping on the lake.

913
00:52:55.833 --> 00:52:57.500
We'll never catch them.

914
00:53:03.416 --> 00:53:05.000
[Tony] You can do the driving.

915
00:53:05.708 --> 00:53:09.458
But only OSS agents know
how to drive this.

916
00:53:11.916 --> 00:53:13.791
-[engine revs]
-Thanks. Bronson!

917
00:53:15.708 --> 00:53:17.750
[Tony] I just remembered I get seasick.

918
00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:21.250
[dramatic music playing]

919
00:53:36.583 --> 00:53:38.000
They're getting away!

920
00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:39.916
Our boat can't swim.

921
00:53:41.708 --> 00:53:44.916
Yeah. well. their boats can't fly.

922
00:53:45.541 --> 00:53:47.791
Bronson. airborne mode.

923
00:53:57.583 --> 00:54:00.750
[Patty] Bronson. here's the location
we got from the necklace.

924
00:54:00.833 --> 00:54:01.833
Fly us there.

925
00:54:02.541 --> 00:54:05.416
[Tony] Then we can get the code
and save Mom and Dad.

926
00:54:12.375 --> 00:54:14.500
Why are you still reading that book?

927
00:54:14.583 --> 00:54:16.625
These are the cheat codes to life.

928
00:54:16.708 --> 00:54:19.875
You shouldn't cheat the King.
It'll backfire on you.

929
00:54:20.583 --> 00:54:22.541
Be smart and play fair.

930
00:54:22.625 --> 00:54:24.833
-Doesn't work.
-How can you say that?

931
00:54:24.916 --> 00:54:29.375
Remember when we snuck into Dad's office
and found that puzzle he was working on?

932
00:54:29.458 --> 00:54:32.250
Uh-huh. The one
that was really tricky to finish.

933
00:54:32.333 --> 00:54:34.916
When I solved it for him.
I thought he'd be happy.

934
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.541
but he got mad at me for sneaking
into his work. saying I was dishonest.

935
00:54:38.625 --> 00:54:42.541
Yeah. Then he put up
the tech restrictions on all our stuff.

936
00:54:42.625 --> 00:54:45.791
See? Telling the truth
only got me in trouble.

937
00:54:48.041 --> 00:54:49.500
Maybe at first.

938
00:54:49.583 --> 00:54:53.000
But in the end. honesty always wins.

939
00:54:53.875 --> 00:54:55.458
[alarm blaring]

940
00:54:55.541 --> 00:54:57.083
King's lair up ahead!

941
00:54:58.208 --> 00:55:01.250
-We're not slowing down.
-Bronson. what's wrong?

942
00:55:02.958 --> 00:55:05.000
We're gonna crash into that wall!

943
00:55:19.833 --> 00:55:21.750
[mysterious music playing]

944
00:55:21.833 --> 00:55:24.083
-That wall isn't really there.
-Oh.

945
00:55:24.583 --> 00:55:26.416
Polygon-based architecture.

946
00:55:28.708 --> 00:55:30.666
Just like in old video games.

947
00:55:31.916 --> 00:55:33.875
This guy is living the dream.

948
00:55:37.791 --> 00:55:39.958
[beeping. whirring]

949
00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:41.791
[Tony] No way.

950
00:55:42.583 --> 00:55:46.458
This whole place is
covered in some sort of AR overlay.

951
00:55:46.541 --> 00:55:48.375
AR? That hologram stuff

952
00:55:48.458 --> 00:55:51.083
that makes things look different
than they are?

953
00:55:51.166 --> 00:55:52.750
Yeah. that stuff.

954
00:55:52.833 --> 00:55:55.583
Maybe these glasses
can help us find Mom and Dad.

955
00:55:58.875 --> 00:56:01.250
[breathes heavily. grunts]

956
00:56:05.875 --> 00:56:06.916
Don't take a nap.

957
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.625
We have to keep trying or stop the code
so we can get back to the kids.

958
00:56:10.708 --> 00:56:13.416
Even if we can escape.
I don't think I can stop this.

959
00:56:14.208 --> 00:56:16.958
But you made the code.
Can't you unmake it?

960
00:56:17.041 --> 00:56:18.791
Yes and no.

961
00:56:20.083 --> 00:56:21.583
Operation Fireball?

962
00:56:21.666 --> 00:56:24.166
Of course.
We had to take down that villain Vargos.

963
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:27.250
We were supposed to destroy his lair
and everything in it.

964
00:56:27.333 --> 00:56:29.916
but I found plans for this weapon.

965
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.791
Plans for the Armageddon Code?

966
00:56:32.875 --> 00:56:35.500
I… I brought the plans back home

967
00:56:35.583 --> 00:56:38.291
so I could finish
building the code. but I…

968
00:56:39.666 --> 00:56:41.750
I couldn't figure it out. I failed.

969
00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:45.166
-[Torrez] How did you finish it?
-[Terrence] I didn't.

970
00:56:47.791 --> 00:56:48.791
Tony did.

971
00:56:49.416 --> 00:56:52.208
He doesn't even really know it.
but he did.

972
00:56:53.166 --> 00:56:56.083
-How is that possible?
-He got into my work somehow.

973
00:56:56.166 --> 00:56:58.125
He knew the plans better than I did.

974
00:56:58.208 --> 00:57:00.958
He finished what I started.
and I built Armageddon

975
00:57:01.041 --> 00:57:02.750
on top of what he gave me.

976
00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:05.958
I could've told him everything.
but I scolded him

977
00:57:06.041 --> 00:57:08.500
and put tech restrictions up
to protect the code.

978
00:57:08.583 --> 00:57:10.541
The kids don't even know that's why

979
00:57:10.625 --> 00:57:13.208
everything they love
is being kept from them.

980
00:57:13.291 --> 00:57:14.958
And this is all my fault.

981
00:57:19.083 --> 00:57:21.625
That is quite a story.

982
00:57:25.541 --> 00:57:28.791
I knew you were hiding something from me.

983
00:57:29.333 --> 00:57:32.166
But it doesn't matter who made what.

984
00:57:32.250 --> 00:57:34.833
I've taken the missing piece
from your children.

985
00:57:34.916 --> 00:57:39.208
and within minutes.
the code will be ready to fire. [laughs]

986
00:57:46.291 --> 00:57:48.000
[zapping]

987
00:57:55.541 --> 00:57:56.791
Your kids failed you.

988
00:57:58.791 --> 00:58:00.375
Or maybe you failed them.

989
00:58:03.625 --> 00:58:05.375
[The King chuckles]

990
00:58:07.125 --> 00:58:09.500
So Tony made the code.

991
00:58:11.625 --> 00:58:13.791
Now no one in the world can stop me.

992
00:58:14.791 --> 00:58:16.291
[chuckles]

993
00:58:16.375 --> 00:58:18.541
Tony! Tony made it!

994
00:58:18.625 --> 00:58:20.666
[laughs]

995
00:58:20.750 --> 00:58:22.750
[suspenseful music playing]

996
00:58:30.583 --> 00:58:32.875
There's a computer behind this panel.

997
00:58:34.291 --> 00:58:35.875
Bronson. we need your help.

998
00:58:46.458 --> 00:58:49.291
Now we can download a map of this place.

999
00:58:52.708 --> 00:58:55.958
Look. The prison cells
are right by the King's VR pods

1000
00:58:56.041 --> 00:58:58.041
he showed on that video at school.

1001
00:58:59.208 --> 00:59:00.458
I hear footsteps.

1002
00:59:21.125 --> 00:59:24.583
-[Tony] Just don't look down.
-[Patty] I might've already looked down.

1003
00:59:24.666 --> 00:59:27.833
[The King] Armageddon is close
to being combined.

1004
00:59:28.625 --> 00:59:30.875
Then it will be unstoppable.

1005
00:59:31.666 --> 00:59:36.250
The King is already combining the code.
We have to find Mom and Dad now.

1006
00:59:44.166 --> 00:59:45.083
Oh.

1007
00:59:45.166 --> 00:59:48.583
Those Hyskor characters
are just AR overlays too.

1008
00:59:49.583 --> 00:59:51.208
They're actually robots.

1009
00:59:53.125 --> 00:59:54.125
Aw.

1010
00:59:54.208 --> 00:59:56.166
Those robots aren't so scary.

1011
01:00:03.375 --> 01:00:04.625
[screams] Ah!

1012
01:00:06.458 --> 01:00:08.958
-We need to jump.
-What? Are you crazy?

1013
01:00:09.583 --> 01:00:11.791
-[Tony] We need to jump.
-No!

1014
01:00:11.875 --> 01:00:12.958
[both yell]

1015
01:00:13.541 --> 01:00:15.541
[robots whir and clunk]

1016
01:00:25.541 --> 01:00:27.541
[beeping. whirring]

1017
01:00:29.541 --> 01:00:31.541
[Tony] Those things are totally scary.

1018
01:00:31.625 --> 01:00:33.583
[Patty] This way to the prison cells.

1019
01:00:34.333 --> 01:00:35.416
[Torrez sighs]

1020
01:00:36.708 --> 01:00:39.333
[sweeping orchestral music playing]

1021
01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:42.375
-[Torrez] Is that…
-[Terrence] Our kids.

1022
01:00:42.458 --> 01:00:44.833
-[Terrence] Patty!
-[Patty] Mom! Dad!

1023
01:00:44.916 --> 01:00:46.375
Oh. my babies!

1024
01:00:46.458 --> 01:00:47.875
Are you safe?

1025
01:00:47.958 --> 01:00:48.958
Stand back.

1026
01:00:49.583 --> 01:00:52.791
I'm setting my Magna Boots
from pull to push.

1027
01:00:55.416 --> 01:00:57.041
-[Torrez] Oh!
-[Terrence] Well done!

1028
01:00:57.125 --> 01:01:00.083
-[Terrence] Well done!
-[Torrez] That's my girl. Oh!

1029
01:01:03.416 --> 01:01:04.583
Wow.

1030
01:01:04.666 --> 01:01:09.291
I can't believe you found us.
How… How did you even get here?

1031
01:01:09.375 --> 01:01:14.125
Aw. Bronson flew us in the Super Ducky
that we jacked from the OSS.

1032
01:01:16.416 --> 01:01:17.875
-I am so proud…
-That is…

1033
01:01:17.958 --> 01:01:20.375
-…in this moment
-…just beyond. my sweets.

1034
01:01:20.458 --> 01:01:24.041
[Heck Knight] Armageddon is combined.
Launching in six minutes.

1035
01:01:24.125 --> 01:01:26.333
What now. master spies?
The clock's ticking.

1036
01:01:26.416 --> 01:01:30.541
Actually. I have a really solid plan
inspired by our greatest mission.

1037
01:01:30.625 --> 01:01:32.958
-Operation Fireball.
-You got it.

1038
01:01:33.041 --> 01:01:36.625
What was this Operation Fireball exactly?

1039
01:01:39.333 --> 01:01:44.500
Our mission was to infiltrate
the operation of an evil man named Vargos.

1040
01:01:44.583 --> 01:01:47.541
[Terrence] And we were able
to infiltrate his lair by

1041
01:01:47.625 --> 01:01:48.833
knocking on the door.

1042
01:01:48.916 --> 01:01:50.666
You just knocked on his door?

1043
01:01:51.375 --> 01:01:52.750
-With a truck.
-Big truck.

1044
01:01:52.833 --> 01:01:53.833
[Torrez] Mm-hmm.

1045
01:01:56.416 --> 01:01:59.125
We used our gadgets

Uh…

Well… [mumbles]

1051
01:02:11.666 --> 01:02:15.333
I went to stop the superweapon
while your mother negotiated with Vargos.

1052
01:02:15.416 --> 01:02:16.250
Mm-hmm.

1053
01:02:16.333 --> 01:02:19.333
"Negotiate"?
You mean "beat up." don't you?

1054

[grunting]

1055
01:02:22.875 --> 01:02:25.500
That sums it up.
I couldn't stop the bomb in time.

1056
01:02:25.583 --> 01:02:27.666
I had to stall just long enough…

1057
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:30.791
So that we can
set our own bomb off instead.

1058
01:02:30.875 --> 01:02:34.833
We wiped out Vargos's operation
in one glorious…

-I love you.
-I love you more.

1062
01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:42.458
Awesome.

1063
01:02:42.541 --> 01:02:46.833
Not awesome!
You could've found a better way.

1064
01:02:47.416 --> 01:02:49.833
I'd… Hmm? How?

1065
01:02:49.916 --> 01:02:53.250
You could've asked nicely
to see Mr. Vargos.

1066
01:02:54.041 --> 01:02:58.625
You could've used a thought bubble
to keep the guards entertained.

[fun jingle playing]

1068
01:03:03.333 --> 01:03:08.333
You could've gotten an understanding
of his interior-design sense.

1069
01:03:08.416 --> 01:03:12.375
You could've intervened in his plan
with a softer touch.

1070
01:03:13.541 --> 01:03:15.583
I guess we… could've considered that.

1071
01:03:15.666 --> 01:03:19.375
So that maybe
instead of Operation Fireball.

1072
01:03:19.458 --> 01:03:22.500
it could be Operation Peace and Harmony.

-We have four minutes left.

1076

I could come up with a fantastic plan
if I had a map of this place.

1077
01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:39.791
-Boop.
-[gasps] Yes! Well done.

1078
01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:43.250
We have to get to these computer terminals
to stall for time.

1079
01:03:43.333 --> 01:03:44.166
Let's go.

1080
01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:45.916
-[Tony] That's the whole plan?
-Yup.

1081
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.708
We're gonna buy some time
to send a signal to OSS for help.

1082
01:03:48.791 --> 01:03:52.291
-We stall when we can beat the King?
-Armageddon is being armed.

1083
01:03:52.375 --> 01:03:55.666
Nothing we can do now except slow down
its final process. Let's split up.

01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:58.583
-I'll take Tony. You take Patty.
-They have Magna Boots.

1085
01:03:58.666 --> 01:04:01.541
-They can access the branching path.
-No. no. no. no.

1086
01:04:01.625 --> 01:04:03.833
-It's too dangerous for them.
-You're right.

1087
01:04:03.916 --> 01:04:05.208
Come here a second.

1088
01:04:07.166 --> 01:04:08.375
We can do this.

1089
01:04:08.458 --> 01:04:09.291
[Patty] Yeah.

1090
01:04:10.333 --> 01:04:13.875
-Okay. Hey. you two stick together. okay?
-Okay.

1091
01:04:13.958 --> 01:04:16.458
-And stick to the plan.
-[Patty] Got it.

1092
01:04:17.291 --> 01:04:18.625
We love you too!

01:04:23.333 --> 01:04:25.333
-I immediately regret this.
-So much.

1095
01:04:25.416 --> 01:04:27.041
-Yeah. We should go.
-Yep.

-I've got a new plan.
-What new plan?

1102
01:04:52.458 --> 01:04:55.458
If we get to this elevator.
we can stop the countdown.

1103
01:04:55.541 --> 01:04:59.083
That's not what they told us to do.
We have to stick to the plan.

1104
01:04:59.166 --> 01:05:01.250
We have to do whatever it takes to win.

Wait a minute.

1116
01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:43.958
I know this.

1117
01:05:44.625 --> 01:05:45.916
I made this.

1118
01:05:46.583 --> 01:05:48.583
You made the Armageddon Code?

1119
01:05:48.666 --> 01:05:53.208
Sort of. It was that weird puzzle
from Dad's work. but it wasn't a puzzle.

1120
01:05:53.291 --> 01:05:57.333
-It was the plans for Armageddon Code.
-How are you gonna stop it though?

1121
01:05:57.416 --> 01:05:58.791
The same way I solved it.

1122
01:05:58.875 --> 01:06:01.250
The last part of the plan
had a trick to it.

1123
01:06:01.333 --> 01:06:03.583
where you couldn't tell
if it was completed

1124
01:06:03.666 --> 01:06:06.416
because you had to do
the same steps backwards.

1125
01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:08.625
That's how I'm going to break it.

-Press that button.
-Which one?

-We're out of time!
-Almost there.

1130
01:06:20.916 --> 01:06:24.708
You couldn't tell
if the code was completed or not.

1131
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.125
Tony. wait! Stop! It's a trick!

1132
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.833
[Heck Knight] You have armed Armageddon.

1133
01:06:31.916 --> 01:06:32.750
[Tony] What?

1134
01:06:32.833 --> 01:06:34.208
I just stopped it.

-Mom! Dad!
-Oh. the whole family!

1138
01:06:45.708 --> 01:06:48.416
You weren't able
to complete the code yourself. were you?

1139

Even after you got the missing piece.

1140
01:06:50.375 --> 01:06:55.041
Only the true code creator can activate
the world-conquering potential.

1141
01:06:55.125 --> 01:06:59.708
I made this fake countdown
so you. Tony. could combine it for me.

1142
01:06:59.791 --> 01:07:00.875
Thank you.

1143
01:07:01.458 --> 01:07:04.958
We downloaded Hyskor last night
and caused all of this.

1144
01:07:05.041 --> 01:07:08.500
No. no. no.
You just wanted to play a game.

1145
01:07:09.333 --> 01:07:10.666
You didn't cause this.

1146
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:12.958
They did.

1147
01:07:13.041 --> 01:07:15.333
And so did the rest of the world.

1148
01:07:17.583 --> 01:07:19.000
Vargos was my father.

1149
01:07:21.833 --> 01:07:24.000
From Operation Fireball?

1150
01:07:24.083 --> 01:07:29.458
He was a genius that used his technology
to make our home country a better place.

1151
01:07:29.541 --> 01:07:32.458
Sure. his head wasn't always
in the right spot.

1152
01:07:32.541 --> 01:07:35.833
but someone could have helped guide him.

1153
01:07:36.333 --> 01:07:41.000
But you OSS agents
laid waste to everything.

01:07:41.083 --> 01:07:45.000

as a weapon for yourselves.

1155
01:07:45.083 --> 01:07:48.125
He would've improved the world
with his creation.

1156
01:07:48.208 --> 01:07:51.958
But instead. my father spent
the last days of his life

in some top secret prison.

1158
01:07:55.166 --> 01:07:56.541
I never saw him again.

1159
01:07:57.791 --> 01:08:00.625
I'm so sorry.
but we can't let you do this.

1160
01:08:00.708 --> 01:08:05.875
The only way
to make this world better is by force.

1161
01:08:06.458 --> 01:08:08.916
and my father's creation
will do just that.

Yeah. we did.

then we can beat him

01:10:53.125 --> 01:10:57.166
You're right. Patty. He's controlling
Armageddon from inside the game.

1215
01:10:57.250 --> 01:11:00.750
But if we beat him before he locks us out.
we can save the world.

1216
01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:02.500
Here's my plan.

1217
01:11:02.583 --> 01:11:05.083
We go in. but no cheats. no tricks.

1218
01:11:05.166 --> 01:11:06.250
no rat skills.

1219
01:11:07.041 --> 01:11:10.250
-We play fair together.
-Wait. we go into the video game?

1220
01:11:10.333 --> 01:11:12.208
-Yeah.
-I think we need to regroup.

1221
01:11:12.291 --> 01:11:14.750
-There's no time.
-We should call the OSS agents.

1222
01:11:14.833 --> 01:11:16.416
Figure this out the spy way.

1223
01:11:17.458 --> 01:11:19.875
I'm not following
the spy playbook anymore.

1224
01:11:20.833 --> 01:11:24.458
Patty's been right all this time.
I trust her.

1225
01:11:28.208 --> 01:11:29.791
-Then let's play.
-Let's go.

1226
01:11:29.875 --> 01:11:33.916
[Patty] Dad. you know how you always
tell us video games will fry our brain?

1227
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.958
-Yeah.
-If we lose…

1228
01:11:36.041 --> 01:11:39.416
-This game might actually fry our brains.
-[Patty] Yeah.

1229
01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:42.791
-Wait. what'd they say?
-[chuckles] It's… She didn't…

1230
01:11:42.875 --> 01:11:45.791
-We're gonna have fun. Let's have fun.
-Okay.

1231
01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:52.500
[majestic music playing]

1232
01:12:00.375 --> 01:12:01.416
We're trapped!

1233
01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:04.875
No. Dad. It's an elevator.
The game's about to start.

1234
01:12:04.958 --> 01:12:07.291
Tony. you're playing as Rat Thickskull!

1235
01:12:07.375 --> 01:12:10.666
-And you're playing as Florella!
-Wait. what are these outfits?

1236
01:12:10.750 --> 01:12:13.583
The game made you
play as a character called Tayanna.

1237
01:12:13.666 --> 01:12:16.500
[Tony] And the game made you
play as a character called Itza.

1238
01:12:16.583 --> 01:12:17.583
Got it.

1239
01:12:19.291 --> 01:12:21.166
Here we are.

1240
01:12:21.250 --> 01:12:22.375
Where are we?

1241
01:12:22.875 --> 01:12:27.833
We're at the end of the world. The finale
of the world's most challenging game.

1242
01:12:29.541 --> 01:12:32.375
The ground is cracking. We have to go now!

1243
01:12:32.458 --> 01:12:33.791
[yelling]

1244
01:12:37.083 --> 01:12:39.041
-All right.
-This game is not fun.

1245
01:12:39.125 --> 01:12:40.041
Step one.

1246
01:12:40.125 --> 01:12:43.625
we have to get to that giant statue
to find the King.

1247
01:12:45.333 --> 01:12:48.375
-[Terrence] Are you sure this is right?
-[Torrez] Just keep up!

1248
01:12:49.208 --> 01:12:50.708
I'm working on it!

1249
01:12:52.166 --> 01:12:54.083
[groans] And there goes my back.

1250
01:12:55.833 --> 01:12:58.791
[Tony] Now we have to fight a few bad guys
to get to the statue.

1251
01:12:58.875 --> 01:13:01.291
[Patty] And with only nine minutes left.

1252
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.250
Wait. Why are there so many of them?

1253
01:13:05.333 --> 01:13:06.625
[Tony] It's a game.

1254
01:13:06.708 --> 01:13:08.333
It's more fun that way.

1255
01:13:10.166 --> 01:13:12.208
[Tony] If we fall. we lose.

1256
01:13:12.291 --> 01:13:14.708
[Patty] If we don't work as a team.
we lose.

1257
01:13:14.791 --> 01:13:16.500
[Terrence] How do we not lose?

1258
01:13:16.583 --> 01:13:18.916
Just think of this as an ambush.

1259
01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Goody.

1260
01:13:20.083 --> 01:13:22.208
-[swords ring]
-[grunting]

1261
01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.500
[Terrence] Ouch! Ow. Ow.

1262
01:13:28.708 --> 01:13:29.666
[grunts]

1263
01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:33.708
[Patty] How about a skeleton?

1264
01:13:35.833 --> 01:13:37.750
Two skeletons!

1265
01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:39.875
Use your bracelet.

1266
01:13:39.958 --> 01:13:41.833
It's like a spy gadget.

1267
01:13:45.291 --> 01:13:46.958
-[Patty] See?
-Whoa.

1268
01:13:50.333 --> 01:13:52.583
-[Tony] Use your hammer to hit. Dad!
-Oh!

1269
01:13:53.375 --> 01:13:54.458
[Terrence] Argh!

1270
01:13:55.166 --> 01:13:56.666
[Terrence laughs] Ah!

1271
01:14:01.166 --> 01:14:02.791
Your dad's pretty cool. huh?

1272
01:14:05.541 --> 01:14:06.958
Is that a flaming skull?

1273
01:14:07.041 --> 01:14:08.291
[Patty] Get lost!

1274
01:14:08.375 --> 01:14:09.333
You too.

1275
01:14:12.458 --> 01:14:14.166
Flaming skulls!

1276
01:14:17.541 --> 01:14:18.916
Go. Mom!

1277
01:14:22.625 --> 01:14:24.041
Thank you. Mom.

1278
01:14:24.541 --> 01:14:26.041
I'll always have your back.

1279
01:14:26.125 --> 01:14:27.541
-[gasps] Duck!
-Whoa!

1280
01:14:30.458 --> 01:14:31.458
Ooh!

1281
01:14:35.833 --> 01:14:36.833
Wow.

1282
01:14:40.416 --> 01:14:41.791
I upgraded.

1283
01:14:41.875 --> 01:14:43.250
Look at you.

1284
01:14:45.875 --> 01:14:48.916
Florella gets stronger
as you work through the game.

1285
01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.250
She sure does.

1286
01:14:50.958 --> 01:14:52.958
[jubilant fanfare playing]

1287
01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.708
[tense music builds]

1288
01:14:56.791 --> 01:14:58.791
So is that it? Did we win?

1289
01:14:58.875 --> 01:15:03.708
No. It's time for step two.
We have to beat the last player standing.

1290
01:15:04.666 --> 01:15:05.500
The King.

1291
01:15:05.583 --> 01:15:08.708
[Tony] But only one of us
can go in to face him.

1292
01:15:08.791 --> 01:15:11.500
The rest of us
have to defeat his champion.

1293
01:15:11.583 --> 01:15:13.041
the Heck Knight.

1294
01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000
[Patty] You're our best player. Tony.
You're the only one

1295
01:15:18.083 --> 01:15:20.458
who can beat the King
without losing all your health.

1296
01:15:20.541 --> 01:15:21.958
What? We have health?

1297
01:15:22.041 --> 01:15:24.166
Yeah. Yours is low. Dad. Real low.

1298
01:15:24.250 --> 01:15:27.458
-Oh. I thought I was just losing weight.
-No. Come on!

1299
01:15:28.375 --> 01:15:29.375
Wait.

1300
01:15:29.875 --> 01:15:33.125
I don't know if I can win this
without my tricks or cheats.

1301
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:35.208
What if I lose?

1302
01:15:36.125 --> 01:15:38.416
Worth it.

1303
01:15:42.708 --> 01:15:44.708
[foreboding music playing]

1304
01:15:49.291 --> 01:15:51.833
[The King] Now.
while everyone plays Hyskor.

1305
01:15:52.333 --> 01:15:54.541
I can improve the world.

1306
01:15:55.666 --> 01:15:59.208
Deleting all nuclear launch codes.

1307
01:15:59.291 --> 01:16:01.958
No need for that in my world.

1308
01:16:03.125 --> 01:16:03.958
And…

1309
01:16:04.666 --> 01:16:05.833
Oh!

1310
01:16:05.916 --> 01:16:07.000
Hello.

1311
01:16:08.291 --> 01:16:10.291
Another player ready to cheat.

1312
01:16:10.375 --> 01:16:13.416
I've been watching your every move
from this throne.

1313
01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:17.916
and as I have designed my games from here.
now I'm designing Earth.

[thunder rumbles]

1315
01:16:21.833 --> 01:16:23.791
[The King] You are so impressive.

1316
01:16:24.583 --> 01:16:28.166
I don't think I could even stop you kids
out there in the real world.

1317
01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:30.458
But… in here.

1318
01:16:32.666 --> 01:16:33.666
I can never lose.

1319
01:16:33.750 --> 01:16:35.500
[rapid whooshing]

1320
01:16:38.125 --> 01:16:40.500
If you lower my health to zero. you win.

1321
01:16:41.208 --> 01:16:42.750
But if I lower yours…

1322
01:16:45.291 --> 01:16:47.041
game over.

1323

[The King laughs]

1325
01:16:52.458 --> 01:16:56.416
Careful. Tony. The staff is
Rat Thickskull's worst weapon.

1326
01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:57.708
Well.

1327
01:16:58.625 --> 01:17:01.541
it's a good thing I'm not Rat Thickskull.

1328
01:17:01.625 --> 01:17:02.875
Hmm.

1329
01:17:02.958 --> 01:17:06.000
Because Rat's not good at a lot of things.

1330
01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:07.666
He's a scoundrel.

1331
01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:09.875
He does anything to win.

1332
01:17:10.375 --> 01:17:11.833
And that's why today.

1333
01:17:13.166 --> 01:17:15.333
I'm playing as myself.

1334
01:17:20.250 --> 01:17:21.250
Shall we?

[Tony] First of all. "the King"?

1347
01:18:10.791 --> 01:18:11.625
Really?

1348
01:18:11.708 --> 01:18:13.833
If you can create your own world.

1349
01:18:14.958 --> 01:18:17.166
why not make yourself the king? [echoes]

1350
01:18:17.250 --> 01:18:20.291
You'll become the court jester
when I'm done with you.

Yeah. I didn't have
this big ol' fist then. did I?

1358
01:18:46.875 --> 01:18:49.250
Catch me…

-The ground is unstable. You'll fall.
-[Heck Knight] Why would I trust you?

1375
01:19:52.416 --> 01:19:53.916
Because you can.

[Terrence] Come on. big guy. [grunts]

1378
01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:07.041
You did it. You found a better way.

1379
01:20:07.125 --> 01:20:09.041
You saved the Heck Knight.

henceforth. I will follow you.

for your integrity is pure.

We did our part.
but we're running out of time.

1386

Tony has to win. Now.

[The King] Come on. Rat.

Tony's in trouble.

1396

I have to help him.

Your father's breaking the rules!

1400
01:21:29.541 --> 01:21:30.833
Dad!

01:21:46.250 --> 01:21:48.958
[Tony. breathlessly] No… cheating.

1405
01:21:53.791 --> 01:21:56.375
But I played fair.

1406
01:21:56.458 --> 01:21:58.125
It doesn't matter.

-The One Hit.
-[Torrez] What?

1414
01:22:35.083 --> 01:22:37.875
[Patty] Tony just received
the legendary One Hit.

1415
01:22:37.958 --> 01:22:40.416
the mythical ability
hidden within the game.

1416
01:22:43.583 --> 01:22:44.958
How did you…

1417
01:22:45.041 --> 01:22:48.291
Maybe because I played the game
like my sister said.

1418
01:22:50.875 --> 01:22:52.625
I believe her now.

1419
01:22:52.708 --> 01:22:54.541
No. No. No!

1424

[Tony] You lost.

1425
01:23:13.458 --> 01:23:16.958
You won fair and square.
but I can't let you stop Armageddon.

1426
01:23:17.041 --> 01:23:19.291
It's the only way to fix this world.

1427
01:23:19.375 --> 01:23:23.625
You could have removed the One Hit
from the game. but you didn't.

1428
01:23:24.666 --> 01:23:29.125
Yes. but I stopped trusting this world
to make itself a better place.

1429
01:23:30.083 --> 01:23:33.125
The only way to do it is by force.

1430
01:23:33.208 --> 01:23:36.458
Your games never forced me to play fair.

1431
01:23:36.541 --> 01:23:38.291
My sister inspired me to.

1432
01:23:38.916 --> 01:23:42.041
So now we just have to inspire the world
to be better.

1433
01:23:42.541 --> 01:23:47.500
You know. instead of forcing everyone
to be gamers like us.

1434
01:23:48.916 --> 01:23:49.916
Like us.

1435
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.250
It's true.

1436
01:23:53.333 --> 01:23:57.166
You and your sister have shown
that maybe we do have the power to

1437
01:23:57.250 --> 01:23:58.833
inspire them.

1450
01:25:03.666 --> 01:25:04.958
Well done.

1451

Tony.

1452
01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.791
You showed me the goodness I thought
I could only find in a game world.

1453
01:25:14.875 --> 01:25:16.208
and I… I thank you.

1454

-You've raised some wonderful children.
-We did.

1455
01:25:20.125 --> 01:25:23.083
Congratulations. agents.
You have defeated your enemy.

1456
01:25:23.166 --> 01:25:25.541
-What?
-Now the King must face his sentence.

1457
01:25:25.625 --> 01:25:27.375
-There's a better way.
-What?

1458
01:25:27.458 --> 01:25:30.125
Throwing him in prison
won't make him a good person.

1459
01:25:30.208 --> 01:25:34.083
-Then where do we send him?
-This is why we need to make a change.

1460
01:25:34.166 --> 01:25:35.875
Inside his own game.

1461
01:25:36.708 --> 01:25:38.166
The only reason we won

1462
01:25:38.250 --> 01:25:41.375
is because his game
makes you better as you play.

1463
01:25:41.458 --> 01:25:46.000
-Hyskor has all the guidance he needs.
-That's not how we work in the OSS.

1464
01:25:46.083 --> 01:25:47.125

Excuse me?

On page two of How To Be a Spy.

1467
01:25:50.208 --> 01:25:53.875
it states that the high-level OSS agent
that catches the enemy

1468
01:25:53.958 --> 01:25:56.125
is best suited to decide their judgment.

1469
01:25:56.208 --> 01:26:00.458
And because we caught the enemy
and you didn't.

1470
01:26:00.541 --> 01:26:02.875
that makes us the high-level agents.

1471
01:26:02.958 --> 01:26:05.083
-[character] Ooh!
-[Heck Knight] Radical!

1472

Wow.

-Smart kid.
-Yeah.

1474
01:26:10.208 --> 01:26:14.583
Therefore. the King will be locked
inside his lair under OSS surveillance

1475
01:26:14.666 --> 01:26:16.000
until he beats Hyskor.

You're saving me?

1480
01:26:23.791 --> 01:26:27.375
You'll be saving yourself
by working through your own game.

1481
01:26:27.458 --> 01:26:29.666
And with game theory.
anything can be fixed.

1482

I never thought our kids
would show us how to be great spies.

They showed us how to be something better.

in the OSS has been an honor. but

1490

we quit.

01:27:05.375 --> 01:27:06.208
Excuse me?

1492
01:27:06.291 --> 01:27:09.125
We'd rather figure out
our own way to save the world.

1493

Honestly and together.

-[chip crunches]

some of the changes we'll be making.

to turn the OSS into a more effective
and honest job.
