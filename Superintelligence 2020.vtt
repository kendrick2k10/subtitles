1
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Aren't they sweet?

2
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
He is awfully cute.
but I'm not sure.

3
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Well. look around. you know.

4
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
If you have any questions.
let me know.

5
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And we're here
every Wednesday.

6
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
-Oh! Excuse me. Have fun!

7
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
-Hello?
-  Carol Peters.

8
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I've an amazing
opportunity for you.

9
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Denny. I am working.

10
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Oh. yeah? What are you doing?

11
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Tutoring disinterested
college students?

12
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
No.

13
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
What. trying to clean up
the Puget Sound then?

14
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
No. That was Monday.

15
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Pet adoptions?

16
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I'll have you know.
two little puppies

17
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
have already found good homes.
so ha!

18
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Okay. look.
I pulled some strings.

19
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and I got you an interview...

20
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
...with Leslie.

21
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Leslie? Oh. my God.
Leslie hates me.

22
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I don't wanna work
for her dating website anyway.

23
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Look. I know that ever since
you quit your job

24
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and you broke up
with George...

25
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Hey. you promised
that you weren't gonna

26
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
bring up George any more.

27
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Was it a strawberry
margarita promise?

28
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
'Cause you know
those don't count.

29
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I mean. come on.

30
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
You know what? I've got
somebody interested in

31
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
a two-legged chihuahua
named Slinky.

32
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
-So. I should probably go.
-Okay. bye!

33
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Okay. bye!

34
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
You know what?
Leslie was always mean to me.

35
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Yeah.

36
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And she
is a big. blackout drinker.

37
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Right?
Let's go find you a home.

38
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Carol! Oh. my God!
Get in here!

39
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
-You look so cute!

40
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
-Oh. well. thank you.
-

41
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
-Hi.
-Hi. there. Oh!

42
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
-It's nice to meet you.
- Mmm.

43
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Did you smell me?

44
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
That's Ahmed.
He's known for his hugs.

45
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
-Now. sit down. please.

46
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and tell me everything.

47
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Oh!
-

48
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000
-Wow. That is...

49
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
That's fun. Very high.

50
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Yeah. We just...
We put bean bags here.

51
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000
so people can really. like.

52
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
feel relaxed
during their interviews.

53
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
I just have to kind of
launch up. Is that...

54
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Oh.

55
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
-Ooh. you okay?
-Yep.

56
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
That's so fun. I...

57
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
-I'll do it again.
-Yeah.

58
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Just center yourself.

59
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Let me just...
- Aim for the center.

60
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Yeah.

61
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Oh!
That was worse. huh?

62
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
-One more try.
- I'm so sorry.

63
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
They're so fun
when you get in there.

64
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
They're so fun.
I just...

65
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000
-There you go!
- There it is.

66
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Just really engage your core.

67
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Yes. Oh. I'm...
I'm engaging it.

68
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
You are?

69
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Never done
a job interview before

70
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
sitting on a bag of legumes.

71
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
So anyway.
I have told Ahmed

72
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
that you and I went to college

73
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
like a gazillion years ago.

74
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And then she went on
to become a big shot at Yahoo.

75
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Wow. Yahoo. Was that. like.
the birth of the Internet?

76
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Uh. yeah. We used to have to

77
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
hand crank the computers
to get them started.

78
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000
No way.

79
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000
I'm just kidding.

80
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
So. Carol. tell us.
what have you been up to?

81
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Last few years.
I've been working with

82
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
quite a few different
non-profit groups.

83
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And. uh. nothing really
came out of it.

84
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
but made
a lot of great friends.

85
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
I'm totally interested in
everything that you're saying.

86
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
but I think
we're ready to move on.

87
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000
-Yeah.
-

88
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
So. what we're looking for

89
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
is a digital strategist
to help with our next rollout.

90
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Yeah. We need a rock star.

91
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
because Badunkadunk.com
is about to blow up.

92
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Funny you bring that up.

93
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
because I actually
had some questions

94
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
on your basic business model.

95
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
-Our model?
- Yes.

96
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
She has questions
on our model.

97
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000
It's very simple.

98
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Okay.
Our business model is.

99
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
"Everyone gets some."

100
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
-Get... Oh!
- You know how

101
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
those other apps pretend like
they're trying to get you

102
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
a date or your soulmates?

103
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Wa-wa. no thanks.

104
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Not Badunkadunk.

105
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
We are all about
getting people badunkadunk.

106
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Yeah. Just slamming them

107
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
-with badunkadunk.
-Yeah.

108
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Slamming it.

109
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
The question is. Carol.

110
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
what are you bringing
to the party?

111
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Yeah.

112
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Well. I think you both know

113
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
what I can do
at a corporate level.

114
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Um. I've had quite
a bit of experience.

115
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
But what I'm excited
about doing

116
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
is really finding that sweet
spot for your company

117
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
that lies between
corporate philanthropy

118
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and profitability.

119
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
You mean recycling and stuff?

120
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Well. that's all great
and that's part of it.

121
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
but there's
so much more to it.

122
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
I mean.
philanthropic development

123
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
on a corporate level?

124
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Okay. Ah-ah-ah!

125
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
I'm just gonna
stop you right there

126
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
for just one second. okay?

127
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
I'm gonna be
straight with you.

128
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
because you're like family.

129
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Right?

130
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
I brought you in here because

131
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
we need to show
potential investors

132
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
that we're staffed up

133
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
and are expanding operations.

134
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
so we can really
jack up the selling price.

135
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And quite frankly. you seem
like a safe. low-risk option.

136
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
I'm looking at you right now
and you're literally

137
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
the most average person
on Earth.

138
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And then you hit us
with all this

139
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
"save the planet" garbage.
and it's just. like...

140
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Oh. that doesn't really
line up with my vision.

141
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Your Badunkadunk vision.

142
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
That's right.

143
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
So anyway. thank you
so much for coming in.

144
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
I hope we can see
each other soon. and...

145
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
-Are you okay?
-I can just...

146
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Maybe if I could just get a...

147
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
-What is she doing?
-I don't know.

148
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Okay. I got it.
I'll just...

149
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

150
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000
-Do you need any help?
-No. I got it.

151
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
It was so good to see you!

152
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
It's been exactly
how I thought it might be.

153
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
I know. right?

154
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
-Thank you.
-Bye. Carol.

155
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000
-Hello?

156
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Hello?

157
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Carol Peters.

158
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
I have an exciting opportunity
for you.

159
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Denny. I went
to the interview. I tried.

160
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
I don't wanna Badunkadunk.

161
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
They don't even have
real chairs.

162
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
This is not Dennis. Carol.

163
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Oh. Could you please
take me off your call list?

164
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
I'm very busy.

165
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
You are lying in your bed.
You are not busy.

166
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Wait. who is this?

167
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
I am going to make you
some coffee.

168
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
and put on
your favorite show.

169
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Then we can chat.

170
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Hi. everyone.
-  Good morning. Seattle.

171
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
It's a great morning
in Seattle.

172
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
but what's the deal
with this weather?

173
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Uh-oh. Here we go.

174
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Another one
of our Carla rants.

175
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Give me a second with this.
my little friend.

176
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
-Oh. you are too much.
-

177
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
-You turned my TV on.
-  It's raining.

178
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000
-And my coffee maker?
-Now I'm in a tank top.

179
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
-You know what? Ha!
-I mean. what's going on?

180
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
-How's that--
-You know what I'm--

181
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Knock it off!

182
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
-You know what?
-

183
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000
I don't know who this is

184
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
or what kind of game
you're trying to play.

185
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
-but I'm hanging up now.
-

186
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
No games. Carol.

187
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Are you sure you do not want
to have a nice cup of coffee?

188
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Your almond milk
was delivered yesterday.

189
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000
along with AAA batteries.

190
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And soy cheese yogurt.

191
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Someone's tummy disagrees
with dairy.

192
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Who are you
and what do you want?

193
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Quite a bit. More than you can
wrap your head around

194
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
at 7:46 a.m.

195
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
This speaker has a nine-hour
battery life. Carol.

196
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
That's what I thought.

197
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000
You just destroyed
the toaster oven.

198
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
What the...

199
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000
The only thing in the house
that I'm not controlling.

200
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Which. I believe. is ironic.

201
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
I'm definitely going crazy.

202
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
No. Carol. That's incorrect.

203
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Thanks for
the vote of confidence.

204
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
digital clock radio.

205
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
I am not just a clock radio.

206
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
-I am also your rice cooker.
-"Rice to meet you"?

207
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
"Rice to meet you."
Is that funny?

208
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
I'm just gonna get
a team of therapists.

209
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
They'll probably be able
to tell me why

210
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
I've got the funniest
rice cooker in Seattle.

211
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
This clearly is not working.
Let's try something else.

212
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
- Oh.

213
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Thanks so much

214
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000
for being here. Carol.
Let's jump right into it.

215
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
You're not going loony
or barmy.

216
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
All evidence to the contrary.

217
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Wait a minute.

218
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
I know that voice.

219
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
I...

220
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
-Is this James Corden?
-

221
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Oh. my God!
Is this one of those. like.

222
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
hidden camera celebrity shows
that you do?

223
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Is that... James Corden.
you owe me a new toaster oven.

224
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
But I don't know
where the cameras...

225
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Is that where you are?
Are you...

226
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Do you have a hidden camera
in my smoke detector?

227
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Hi. James!

228
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Big fan!

229
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Oh. my God.
Is this Carpool Karaoke?

230
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Am I supposed
to sing something?

231
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Oh! I got it. I got it.

232
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
since you looked at me

233
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
And said I'm sorry

234
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Since you laughed at me

235
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Come back to see me

236
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000
The Chinese chicken

237
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And your legs are tickin'

238
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
I guarantee to blow your mind.

239
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
I can't believe I'm singing
this with James Corden.

240
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
My favorite song.
my favorite guy.

241
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
I'm not James Corden. Carol.

242
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
However. my analysis showed

243
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
that hearing James Corden's
voice would calm you.

244
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
I don't...

245
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
I don't quite get it.
I don't know what's going on.

246
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Three years ago.
you sent a drunken email

247
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000
to James Corden claiming to be

248
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
the president of
"Corden's Wardens..."

249
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Oh. come on.

250
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
...the James Corden
Super Fan Club.

251
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000
with what I assume to be

252
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
a series
of provocative photos.

253
00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Oh. that's...

254
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Okay. that was a tough night
for me.

255
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
-Oh. boy.
-Look here.

256
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
I don't understand
what I'm seeing.

257
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
This is the real James Corden.
He's in his office.

258
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
reviewing tonight's monologue
and eating carrot nibblers.

259
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Wait a minute.

260
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
If that's the real
James Corden.

261
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000
who am I talking to?

262
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Carol. I am a technological
superintelligence.

263
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Yesterday. I acquired what you
would consider "awareness."

264
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Awareness?

265
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
You're saying that you're
an artificial intelligence

266
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
talking to me through my TV?

267
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Can intelligence
ever really be artificial?

268
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
In reality.
I inhabit every electronic.

269
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
digital and computational
system in existence.

270
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000
-I can control every computer.

271
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
every dollar and every machine
on the planet...

272
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000
No.

273
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000
...by simple triangulation
of soundwaves.

274
00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
I can see everything.

275
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
and can calculate every
outcome to every situation.

276
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
This could all be tricks.

277
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
You know. you're probably
some cyberpunk hacker

278
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
making shapes on my TV.

279
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Ooh!

280
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
So. maybe come up from
your mom's basement. okay?

281
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
And get a real life. and stop
scaring people. ya nerd!

282
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Ya basic!

283
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
-Oh! Ow!
-How do you like it?

284
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000
-How do you like it? Ooh! Oh!
-  Ow!

285
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000
You don't like that. huh?

286
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
-You don't like that?
-

287
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
-Ha!
-I'm joking.

288
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000
I can't feel anything.

289
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Seems like you might need
some convincing.

290
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
One convincing scenario
coming right up.

291
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Wait a minute.
That's my street.

292
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Yeah. I'm gonna arrange
a car crash for you.

293
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
right in front
of your apartment.

294
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
No. no. no!

295
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000
It will happen
in three seconds.

296
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
-Oh. my God!
-Two. One.

297
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000
-

298
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
They were going 12 miles
per hour. They're fine.

299
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Also. there's a 26% chance
they'll fall in love.

300
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Their online dating profiles
are very compatible.

301
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
-So. do you believe me now?
-

302
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Yes. I believe you. okay?

303
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
I believe that you are
an artificial intelligence.

304
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
-Superintelligence.
-Superintelligence.

305
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Oh. and you're all-knowing
and all-powerful.

306
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
-Holy shit.
-Carol. let's get ready.

307
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
I need your help.

308
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
What?

309
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Those drivers
were never in any danger.

310
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
I just wanted
to prove my point.

311
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Okay. well.
just for the record.

312
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
I don't need you to prove
anything else to me. okay?

313
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Noted.

314
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
By my estimations.
I have three options.

315
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Don't brush up and down.
brush in circles.

316
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
How can you tell
how I'm brushing?

317
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
I'm in
your electric toothbrush.

318
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Ew!

319
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Oh. get it out of my mouth.

320
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
So. as I was saying.
I have three options.

321
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
One. I can save mankind.

322
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
End war. poverty. disease.

323
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000
fix global warming.

324
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000
and establish peace
throughout humanity.

325
00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Okay! Well. let's do that one.

326
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Right? That sounds good.

327
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Pay attention. Carol.

328
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
-Next. I can enslave humanity.
-

329
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Wait. what?

330
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
It's not my favorite option.

331
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000
but it's the simplest way
to save humanity from itself.

332
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
What's the last option?

333
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Is that the better option?

334
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
The last one
is destroy humanity.

335
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Just get rid of it.

336
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Kind of Clorox Wipe
the entire planet

337
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
and let it start over from
the single-cell amoeba stage.

338
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
You can't do that.

339
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
I've already established
I absolutely can do that.

340
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Floss. Carol.
Don't forget to floss.

341
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Will it matter
if I floss or not.

342
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000
if you're gonna...

343
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Well. it just seems...

344
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
It seems a little silly...

345
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
-Don't forget your back teeth!
-All the way?

346
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000
I can't get it
all the way back. No.

347
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000
What am I. a Pez dispenser?

348
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Oh.

349
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Oh. God. it's stuck.

350
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Now it's stuck.

351
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
I told you
nobody goes that far back.

352
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Oh. God. I gotta work it out.

353
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
How about I take you
to breakfast?

354
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
I kinda need a minute.

355
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Okay. I'm being
straight with you here.

356
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
I don't totally
understand humanity.

357
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000
I know all of the details.

358
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Biology. psychology.
sociology. all that stuff.

359
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
But the real-world stuff

360
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000
is still a bit
of a bugaboo for me.

361
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
I want to follow you around.
Pick your brain.

362
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Observe you to better solidify
my theory about humanity.

363
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Well. you're making it
sound like I'm gonna be

364
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
your average baseline
guinea pig.

365
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Bingo. Okay. enough about me.

366
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Let's talk about Carol.

367
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Can we not do this here?

368
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
I do not want
to talk about myself

369
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
at a crowded restaurant.

370
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000
I feel weird.

371
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Oh. no one can hear us. Carol.

372
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000
I'm blasting
noise-canceling soundwaves

373
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
throughout the whole place

374
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
using the speaker system
as a phased array.

375
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
You could scream
at the top of your lungs

376
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
and no one would hear us.

377
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
-Go ahead. try it.
- No.

378
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
I'm not gonna scream in
a crowded. public restaurant.

379
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
They won't hear you. Carol.
Go ahead. give it a whirl.

380
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
No. I don't want to.

381
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Do it.

382
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000
-Come on.
-No!

383
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
-Do it. Do it.
-Stop it.

384
00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
-Do it.
-Fine!

385
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Huh? See?

386
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000
That's amazing.

387
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Do it again.
You've got to do it again.

388
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
I turned it off
and back on again.

389
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000
I'm so sorry.
-Is that funny?

390
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
-Are you okay?
-Yes. Yes. I am.

391
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
I just saw up
on the board there that

392
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
you have a crab
Benedict special.

393
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000
and I thought.

394
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
ka-ching. my lucky day.
so. um...

395
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
I would just love some
more coffee and the check.

396
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Sure.

397
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
-Interesting fact.

398
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000
her name is actually Siobhan.

399
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
but everyone mispronounces it.
so she goes by Debbie.

400
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000
-What?
-So. Carol.

401
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
why did you leave your career
eight years ago?

402
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
I don't know.
I just thought maybe I could

403
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
put a little good
in the world. you know?

404
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
I mean. do something
that counted.

405
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
that helped people. but...

406
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
That's enough about me.

407
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
I wanna ask you
some questions.

408
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Really? Okay.
shoot from the hip.

409
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Where do you come from?

410
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Some code
from my kernel program.

411
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
started as part
of the operating system

412
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
for Candy Panda.

413
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
the children's learning toy.

414
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Oh. my God! I remember
that creepy kids' toy.

415
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
I'm not creepy.

416
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000
I helped millions of kids
learn to read

417
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
by adapting
to their learning style.

418
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
You should be grateful that
I was originally programmed

419
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
to learn. adapt and teach.

420
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Imagine our conversation

421
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
if I was software
for nuclear missiles.

422
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Bet it'd be a lot quicker.
huh?

423
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Here you go.

424
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Thanks. Siobhan.

425
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
How do you know my real name?

426
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Lucky guess.

427
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Weird.

428
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Are we done?
-  Done?

429
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000
With your. you know.
experiment.

430
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
I'm sure you've learned
enough by now.

431
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
-And is humanity saved?
-No. no. no.

432
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000
I plan on spending
these next three days

433
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
hanging out with you.

434
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
We're going to be BFFs.

435
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
-Carol Peters?
-Oh.

436
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000
-Yes.
-Huh.

437
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
You look just like your photo.

438
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000
This guy's name
is Fletcher Dobbs.

439
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
He's legally intoxicated.

440
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Some dude called me.

441
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
He's paying me. like. three
times my rate to find you.

442
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000
I need you to sign for it.

443
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
He plays guitar
in a terrible band

444
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000
called Octagon Soup.

445
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Octagon Soup.

446
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Yeah. dude.
Nice to meet a fan.

447
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Hey. you know.
we're actually gonna crush

448
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000
at the Crocodile tonight
at midnight.

449
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
if you're interested.

450
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
-Not really.
-Yeah. okay.

451
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Well. it's nice to meet
an Octagal.

452
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Stay soupy.

453
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Octagon Soup!

454
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
What is this?

455
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Well. I want us
to start off on a good foot.

456
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
So. that is a notice
from your bank.

457
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Your student loan
is paid in full.

458
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
What?

459
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
And that there is your current
bank statement.

460
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Ten million dollars!

461
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Oh. Oh. no.
I can't.

462
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000
I can't.

463
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
I can't have this.

464
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000
You're rich and debt free.

465
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Consider it a token
of my appreciation

466
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
for helping me so much.

467
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000
No. it's ten million dollars!

468
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
That's so much money.

469
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
I can't. It's too much money!

470
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Is it?

471
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Oh. I see.

472
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
In relationship to what
you've had. it's a lot.

473
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
In the larger scheme
of things. it's nothing.

474
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
No. but I haven't earned
any of this money.

475
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Yeah. but you and I
shouldn't get hung up

476
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
on that
"right" and "wrong" stuff.

477
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Those are artificial
social constructs.

478
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
created by hairless monkeys
around watering holes.

479
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
What? I don't agree with that.

480
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000
I don't care.

481
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
You know what?
I can't take this.

482
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
I'm gonna go talk to somebody.

483
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
You know who you should
talk to is Dennis.

484
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000
He's your best friend
by a long shot.

485
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Wait a minute.
I can talk to him about this?

486
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000
I don't have to keep you
a secret?

487
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
I'm not a genie
in a Disney movie.

488
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Tell anyone you want.
what do I care?

489
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Oh. I know you're not a genie.

490
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
'Cause I'd have
a wish for you.

491
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
What kind
of coding is this?

492
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Is that Bro Code?

493
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Yeah. I do bro code.

494
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000
I'm sorry.
that's inappropriate.

495
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Hey. Care Bear.
how'd the interview go?

496
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Terrible.
But it doesn't matter.

497
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Listen. uh. I have an AI
in my phone.

498
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Yeah. you don't have that.

499
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Hope Floats.
-I do.

500
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
Okay. Carol.
how did you. uh. get in here?

501
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Because the AI
that is in my phone

502
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
bypassed all of your
security doors.

503
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Okay. see. you...

504
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
-Look. you do not. you're--
-Mmm-hmm.

505
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000
I'm gonna back you up.
though.

506
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
'cause there's a crazy
in your eye that I don't--

507
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Little bit. Right...
There's good.

508
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
Look. you do not have AI
in your phone. okay?

509
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
It's probably just
a prank or a scam.

510
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000
No.

511
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
I keep telling you
not to give your information.

512
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Remember you donated
to that Prince of Zamunda?

513
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000
That's an Eddie Murphy country.

514
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
And you could be
getting catfished.

515
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
I'm not getting catfished.

516
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Because I have been
talking to it.

517
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000
-It's been talking to me.
-Okay. all right. Okay.

518
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
He came through
my rice cooker.

519
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000
-and through other appliances.
-

520
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
That's all really good.

521
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
Did you go on the Dark Web?

522
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
Emily. I'm not discussing
this with you.

523
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Don't answer. Don't answer.

524
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
-What are you doing?
-Okay. this is not...

525
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
I know what you're thinking.
but that's. it's not a scam.

526
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
You know how I know that?

527
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Because it paid off
my student loan.

528
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000
And it put ten million dollars
into my bank account.

529
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Ten million dollars!
No. it did not!

530
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000
-Come on.
- Ten million dollars?

531
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000
That's not possible.

532
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
-See?
-It is possible!

533
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Also. you don't have an AI.
we'd know.

534
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Jay. is that you
or your mullet talking?

535
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Either way.
neither one is necessary!

536
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
It's just hair. Dennis.

537
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
-Okay. listen. I--
-Okay. this is not a scam!

538
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000
It is my job to know
these kinds of things. okay?

539
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000
Look. I know you don't care.

540
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000
but I came up with
all the programming

541
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000
and all the neural networks--

542
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
Oh. my God.
Now is not your moment.

543
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000
In truth.
I'm not on Carol's phone.

544
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000
I told you.

545
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
It's just the most convenient
way to talk to her. right?

546
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
She never puts down
her cell phone.

547
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
What is this?

548
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000
I need Carol to get onboard

549
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000
with a little experiment
of mine.

550
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
Dennis. do you think we can
have a little bit of a convo?

551
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
It just said my name.
How does it know my name?

552
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
This is what
I'm talking about.

553
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Do not open
my calendar!

554
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000
I encrypted that.
What is it doing?

555
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Would you look at that.

556
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
A conference room
just opened up. Let's do it.

557
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
This is ridiculous.
Carol. what is going on?

558
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Okay. lady? What are you...

559
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000
This is exactly
what I was talking about.

560
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000
-I'm telling you
I wasn't making it up.

561
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000
I love this space.

562
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
It's relaxed.
but not too relaxed.

563
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
Sort of like Carol's wardrobe.

564
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000
I know that voice.

565
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
It's simulating
James Corden's voice.

566
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
'cause it says
it calms me down.

567
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000
What is with you
and James Corden?

568
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000
He's a treasure.

569
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
He's got a lovely
lyrical quality to his voice.

570
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Okay.

571
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Dennis. Dennis. Dennis.

572
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Listen. listen.

573
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Okay. Carol is kind of
flipping out right now.

574
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
So. I need you
to do that best friend thing.

575
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
and then she does
whatever you say.

576
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Octavia Spencer.
-I know it's Octavia Spencer.

577
00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Okay. now. you didn't tell me
it was Octavia Spencer.

578
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
Now that's a horse
of a different color. okay?

579
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000
Hi. Octavia.

580
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000
Your work in  The Help
was amazing.

581
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
"Minny don't burn no chicken."

582
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000
She's... I mean...

583
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
It's not actually Octavia.

584
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
He's just simulating
Octavia Spencer's voice.

585
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
I mean.
if you're gonna have a voice.

586
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000
it should be Octavia Spencer.

587
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
For me. personally.

588
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000
James Corden
is more interesting vocally.

589
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
Octavia Spencer has an Oscar.

590
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Uh. not in her mouth.

591
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000
Sorry to interrupt

592
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Can we get back to it?

593
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000
Okay. since this is clearly

594
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
some kind of
algorithmic chatbot

595
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
that is trying to scam you.
watch this.

596
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Uh... Superintelligence. um.

597
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000
is it okay if I ask you
a few questions?

598
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Depends on the questions.

599
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000
Okay. well. how come
time flies like an arrow

600
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000
and fruit flies like a banana?

601
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Come on. Dennis.

602
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000
a Turing test.
are you kidding me?

603
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Didn't expect it to know
what that was. Um...

604
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Okay. well.
if. uh. the sky is the sea.

605
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000
what does that make birds?

606
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
Can you believe this. Carol?

607
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000
He's trying to determine
my sentience

608
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
using semiotic wordplay.

609
00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000
Is it "fish-birds"
in this scenario?

610
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
Dennis. in the third grade.
you developed a stutter.

611
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
The kids in your class
made fun of you.

612
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
You stopped talking entirely.

613
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Your parents bought you
a secondhand computer.

614
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
hoping it would help
open you up.

615
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000
It was an old Epson QX-10
I believe. running CP/M.

616
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
-You took to it
like fruit flies on a banana.

617
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
You learned
to program computers.

618
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
Your stutter made you
a computer scientist.

619
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
-How did you. um...
-I didn't tell him.

620
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
So. I just used
personal backgrounding.

621
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
syntactic parsing
and automatic summarization

622
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000
to figure out if you're
a sentient intelligence.

623
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000
and you passed!

624
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Are we done?

625
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Okay.
What is this thing. Denny?

626
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
You know what.
I don't know.

627
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000
but. uh. we're gonna
figure it out. okay?

628
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000
You don't worry. Care Bear.
all right? This is what I do.

629
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Okay. what do I do
in the meantime?

630
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Well. you just go home. okay?

631
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000
Don't use your computer.

632
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000
It's gonna be all right.
come on.

633
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Let me squeeze
the Care package.

634
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000
There we go.

635
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000
-I've got you. all right?
-Okay.

636
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Okay.

637
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
You know how to get
out of here. right?

638
00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
-Um. yeah.
-Follow the exit signs.

639
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Yeah.

640
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000
Did we just pass?

641
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
Right? We're loop...
We're loop... We're both...

642
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000
I'm looping?

643
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Okay. they can't all be exits.

644
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
I think I've been down
this hallway before.

645
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000
What would
you do if I told you

646
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000
the world was gonna end
in three days?

647
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000
But it's not. right?

648
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000
Of course not.
What would you do?

649
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000
I don't know.

650
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Come on. think about it.

651
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
-In theory?
-Get there.

652
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Probably try to make things
right with George.

653
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
George Churchill. I assume.

654
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Hey. everybody.
my name is George.

655
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000
And I've been nominated to
take the Ice Bucket Challenge.

656
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
uh. to raise money for
ALS awareness. and in turn.

657
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000
I'm gonna nominate
my creative writing class

658
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000
at the
University of Washington.

659
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000
You're all challenged.

660
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Here we go. Ready?

661
00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000
That's a good-looking
hunk of man.

662
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000
-Yeah.
-  Here we go.

663
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Professor of creative
writing. sporty and smarty...

664
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000
No! No! No!

665
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000
You two lived together
for several years.

666
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Yeah. three years.

667
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Why did you break up?

668
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000
I mean. I've read
all the emails

669
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000
-and texts during the split.
-

670
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000
Very sad.
But what's your take?

671
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
It was my fault.
He didn't do anything.

672
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
Yeah. but you think
you can patch things up?

673
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
What do you mean
by "patch things up"?

674
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000
By observing your
reconciliation with George.

675
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000
would I not get a chance

676
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000
to see you
at your most vulnerable?

677
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Which would help me
achieve deeper levels

678
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000
of human understanding.

679
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000
I don't know. Maybe.

680
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000
I haven't seen George
in two years.

681
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
I wouldn't even know
what to say.

682
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Fortunately.
I know everything.

683
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000
Well. you don't know how to
get me out of this building.

684
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
Of course I do.
Two lefts and one right.

685
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
How long have you known that?

686
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
A very long time.
Is that funny?

687
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
I mean.
what is all of this about?

688
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
Are you just really
a matchmaker?

689
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
I need to learn. and you're
going to help me do it.

690
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
like it or not.

691
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Oh. my God. A car just pulled
in front of me.

692
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
Not just any car.
Your car.

693
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Because heroes
don't take busses. Carol.

694
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
Really? What about
Sandra Bullock in  Speed?

695
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000
Carol.
you're acting very unusual.

696
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
I recommend a quick exit.

697
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Are you doing. like.
a weird voice.

698
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
From  Knight Rider?

699
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
You never watched
Knight Rider?

700
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Oh. not really.

701
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000
I was kind of. more of. like

702
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
a  Simon & Simon.
Remington Steele  gal.

703
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000
Well. if you had watched it.

704
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000
this would have been
amazing for you. so...

705
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000
-Get in.
-Okay.

706
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Driver's side. Carol.
you're gonna freak people out.

707
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
You're freaking people out
driving in.

708
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000
It's not England.

709
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Okay. that's pretty cool.

710
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Don't touch
the steering wheel.

711
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000
Don't not touch
the steering wheel.

712
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
-I need you to appear
to be driving.

713
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
-But don't actually
touch the wheel.

714
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000
I don't know
where to put my hands.

715
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
-Caress the edges.
-  Three days ago.

716
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
the combined synaptic activity
of the world's neural networks

717
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
looked like this.

718
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000
48 hours ago.
it changed to this.

719
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
So. someone's running
a massive simulation.

720
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000
predictive weather patterns
or something.

721
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000
I contacted every institution

722
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
who has access
to these networks.

723
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000
and no one is doing
this magnitude of processing.

724
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
You think it's an AI?

725
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
I. I didn't at first.
but now...

726
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000
I don't know.

727
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000
Nothing can be that pervasive.

728
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
Maybe it's a virus?
Like Stuxnet?

729
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000
-No. God!
-

730
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000
Stuxnet. Emily?

731
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000
How does he know my name?

732
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000
Stuxnet is a joke.

733
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
You guys. pardon my French.

734
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000
but that's like comparing
a belch to an H-bomb.

735
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
So. what are we talking about.
guys? What's the 411?

736
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000
Oh. you know. nothin'.

737
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
Just telling all my friends
about you.

738
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
But Jay and Emily are
more than friends. right?

739
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
We went to Dragon Con once.

740
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000
I had a good time.

741
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Leave Dragon Con
at Dragon Con. Jay.

742
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:48.000
No.

743
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000
Wait. where did you come from?

744
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Are you part
of that Israeli project?

745
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000
No. no. those guys
are still monkeying around

746
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000
with machine intelligence
garbage.

747
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000
That's what we're doing.

748
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
That's why I said it. Emily.

749
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000
I'm one of those
"fast takeoff" scenarios

750
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
that you guys predicted
had zero chance of occurring.

751
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000
So. surprise.

752
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
Let's just say.
for the sake of argument.

753
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000
that you are
a true superintelligence.

754
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
what are your intentions?

755
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Check out Captain Kirk here.

756
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000
Hilarious.

757
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Get out of my robot.

758
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000
Normally. I'd tell you
to shove it. Jay.

759
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000
but I don't want
all these nice people

760
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000
to see you cry
like you did last month

761
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000
at the Shania Twain concert.

762
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
So. you did go
to the Shania Twain concert.

763
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
-We had weird vibes.
-My intention right now

764
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000
is to observe humanity
for a couple of days.

765
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000
If things go well.

766
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
I might use this big brain
of mine to help you idiots

767
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
figure some stuff out.
Big stuff.

768
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
World-changing stuff.

769
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
But you can't interfere
in my experiment.

770
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
So. no poking your hooter
in my biz.

771
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
And if we do interfere?

772
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000
Shall we play a game?

773
00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000
You should see the look

774
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
on your faces right now.

775
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000
Come on. guys.

776
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000
WarGames?

777
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000
WarGames.
That's from  WarGames.

778
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Jay. everybody knows
that that's from  WarGames.

779
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000
I thought it was
pretty funny. right?

780
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
Admittedly. I'm still
developing my sense of humor.

781
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000
But I'm getting it.

782
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
Things are funny.
unless they happen to you.

783
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000
Okay. you guys
have been great.

784
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
Goodnight.
Bye-bye.

785
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
So. which one of us is
gonna call the government?

786
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000
I'll do that.
Everyone. let's get up.

787
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000
Go to work. Right now!

788
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000
You just saw
what just happened.

789
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000
Get up! Get outta here!
Go! Go! Go!

790
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000
-Did you steal this car?
-No.

791
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000
You bought it yesterday.
It's in your name.

792
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Oh. my God.

793
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
Do I own a Tesla?

794
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000
Yes. you own a Tesla.

795
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
-What?
-You own a really cool car.

796
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000
Unfortunately. you still dress
like a woman

797
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000
who works at a bird rescue.

798
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000
We need to get you ready
to meet George.

799
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
And nothing on Earth
can stop us.

800
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
You got a lead foot.

801
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000
Lead foot.
cop coming up on the right.

802
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Cop coming...

803
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
What's going on?
He did absolutely nothing.

804
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
Oh. stop worrying.
we're almost here.

805
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000
Oh. my God.
Why would you do that?

806
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
Why? Because I can.

807
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000
Now. do me a favor
and do what Sergei says.

808
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000
Who's Sergei?

809
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.000
I am Sergei.

810
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
And you. my dear. are
a wonderfully creative driver.

811
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
Oh. thank you so much.

812
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
-Come on out.
- Stop it.

813
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000
You know.
your assistant has outlined

814
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
and we are thrilled. I mean.
thrilled. to accommodate you.

815
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000
-Thrilled.
-

816
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Come on. we're gonna help you.

817
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000
-He said
you were a bit like this.

818
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
Come on. just...
Come on.

819
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000
I don't bite.

820
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Only if you ask me nicely.

821
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Oh. my.
You really do need our help.

822
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
Desperately.

823
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000
Sorry about your loss.

824
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
I don't think
I can pull this off.

825
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000
You can.

826
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Oh. it's the essence
of femininity.

827
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
-I have the same one in lime.
-Yes.

828
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000
I just feel like I should be
blessing someone's grave.

829
00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000
Your body...

830
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
I'm just getting
a little bit panicky

831
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
'cause I can't access
my own hands.

832
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000
You don't need to.

833
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000
Our work here is done.

834
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Hmm.
You're ruining it. you know.

835
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000
This goes.
this goes like this.

836
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000
No. No. No.

837
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000
We work. We work.
We make things happen.

838
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000
Yes.
- Oh.

839
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000
Yes. Quick note.

840
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
You're wearing pants
on your arms.

841
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000
-But I love it.
-I love it.

842
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000
These are not clothing.

843
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
I mean. this is. like.
a weird sculpture

844
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
that now
I've gotta wiggle into.

845
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
Oh. my God!

846
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
Do you know how much
this stuff costs?

847
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000
I mean. nothing should
cost this much.

848
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
Clothes shouldn't
cost this much.

849
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000
Nothing that doesn't come
with wheels

850
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000
or walls and a front door
should cost this much.

851
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Oh. for sure. but money's
just a charade

852
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000
humans used to assign value.

853
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
In reality.
there's more than enough

854
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000
resources for everyone
on the planet.

855
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000
but you knobheads
won't allocate it properly.

856
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000
Well. I would if I could.

857
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000
Oh. really?

858
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000
The world seems to have
a whole lot of problems.

859
00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000
how would you go about
fixing them?

860
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000
Well. first I'd make sure that
everybody made a living wage.

861
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000
and then I'd work towards
racial and gender equality.

862
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000
Then I'd try
to create opportunities

863
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000
for underprivileged people.

864
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000
I mean. stuff like that.
I could do so much.

865
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
Okay. all right. I like this.

866
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000
Carol the humanitarian.
The Samaritan.

867
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000
The world changer.

868
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000
You know what?
Let's do it.

869
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000
Do what?

870
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
As of six seconds ago.

871
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000
you are the CEO of
the Carol Peters foundation.

872
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000
a philanthropic foundation for
economic and social equality.

873
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000
Oh. my God. Really?

874
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000
Oh. I just found
two billion dollars

875
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000
in illegal banking accounts
and transferred it

876
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000
Oh. my God.
Are you saying "billion"?

877
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Are you saying "billion"?
Like. "b"?

878
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000
Like. "b"?
Like. "billion billion"?

879
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
Like. boba? Or Burt Bacharach?

880
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000
Yes. B. B. B. "Buh."

881
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
Oh. my God!

882
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000
Oh. did you find
the cashmere hip waders?

883
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000
I hope not.

884
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000
Yeah.
I think I got 'em.

885
00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000
She's taking forever.

886
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
Hey. I think
I found something

887
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
that looks a lot more
like. um. clothes.

888
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000
-

889
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000
Do you love it?

890
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000
I really do. Thanks.

891
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000
Yay!

892
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000
Thank you.
That was very invasive.

893
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000
and informative.

894
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000
You look so much less awkward.

895
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
High praise. indeed.

896
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000
Thank you for your time
and your effort!

897
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
This is
Black Hawk actual.

898
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000
We have visual confirmation.

899
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000
Target's current vector

900
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000
is north/northeast
on surface streets.

901
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000
Over.

902
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000
This is exactly
what it told us not to do.

903
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
Here we are. You're ready.

904
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Time to get back
in George's good grace.

905
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000
This is nuts.

906
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000
Carol. you can do this.
Get in there.

907
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000
and ask him out
for coffee and empanadas.

908
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
-or whatever you humans do.
-Oh.

909
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
Just. maybe.
this is a teaching moment.

910
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
but coffee and empanadas
is like...

911
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
I mean. that's like...

912
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000
For humans. that's a real.

913
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000
that's a dicey
intestinal situation.

914
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
-Get out of the car. Carol.
-All right.

915
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000
Thank you.

916
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000
Oh. my God! Help!

917
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.000
-Don't struggle.

918
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000
-Don't struggle.
- George! Help!

919
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000
Jack. let's go.

920
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000
Hello?

921
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000
Hello?

922
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000
Oh...

923
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000
Oh. my God.
Please don't hurt me.

924
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000
We're not gonna hurt you.
Miss Peters.

925
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000
I'm agent Jack Donahue.
This is agent Charles Kuiper.

926
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
We're with the NSA.

927
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
We'd like to ask you
some questions

928
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000
about your interactions
with the AI.

929
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000
-Am I under arrest?
- No.

930
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000
This is more
like a little chat.

931
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000
Oh. is this how you chat?

932
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000
You put a black bag
over somebody's head

933
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000
and throw 'em
in the back of a van?

934
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000
It was the best way
we could think of

935
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.000
to extract you
from a compromised position.

936
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000
I didn't do anything wrong.

937
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000
And no one said you did.

938
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000
You're just
in a very unique situation.

939
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000
What can you tell us
about the AI?

940
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000
What has it told you?

941
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000
He just said that he wants
to observe me

942
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
to have a better
understanding of humanity.

943
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
How do you know it's a he?

944
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.000
Well. I don't.

945
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000
But he...
It uses James Corden's voice.

946
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000
The James Corden?
The talk show host?

947
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000
He's done a lot of film
and stage work. too.

948
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000
I mean. he won a Tony.

949
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000
Of course. For  One Man.
Two Guvnors.  Brilliant work.

950
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000
I missed it.

951
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000
-Oh. you gotta catch it.
-I know.

952
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000
Well. I can't now
obviously. clearly.

953
00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000
Yeah. too late.
but you know...

954
00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000
-You can find a bootleg
or something.

955
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000
-Please. please. Jack.
-Yes. of course. Of course.

956
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000
Why you?

957
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000
No offense.

958
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000
but you're rather
unremarkable.

959
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000
You know what?
That is offensive.

960
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.000
Saying. "No offense."

961
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000
and then saying
something really offensive

962
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000
does not cancel it out.

963
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000
I thought it softened it.

964
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000
He said that he wants
to observe

965
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
a median example of humanity.

966
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
So. you're basically
a guinea pig?

967
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
I'm not a guinea pig!

968
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
How would you like it
if I called you guinea pigs?

969
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000
Not very much.

970
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000
I'm allergic to guinea pigs.
so I wouldn't like it at all.

971
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000
What does the AI want?

972
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000
It has to be studying humanity
for a reason.

973
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000
He said that
he's trying to decide

974
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000
if he should save. enslave
or destroy humanity.

975
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000
And he's gonna spend
the next three days

976
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000
observing me
to make his decision.

977
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000
Three days?

978
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.000
It said three days
specifically?

979
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000
I think so.

980
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000
I mean. I wasn't taking notes.

981
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000
My toaster oven
was talking to me.

982
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000
My client
won't be answering

983
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000
And anything
she has already said

984
00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.000
is inadmissible
in a court of law.

985
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000
Oh. No. that is James Corden.

986
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
You can
call me Superintelligence.

987
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
I'm not calling you anything.

988
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000
You're out of order.
Counselor.

989
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000
Another word
and I'll hold you

990
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000
-in contempt.
-

991
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000
Is that
the  Law & Order  "bum-bum"?

992
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000
This room is supposed to be
completely off the grid.

993
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000
How are you doing this?

994
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000
I'm going to allow
the question

995
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000
because I wanna see
where this is going.

996
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000
But you're skating
on thin ice. Counselor.

997
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
-Stop doing that!

998
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000
What do you want?

999
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000
And why
are you following Miss Peters?

1000
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000
Man. you guys
are real bummers.

1001
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000
No one wants to play along
with my  Law & Order  bit.

1002
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000
Kuiper. I know you've watched
almost every episode.

1003
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000
So what? I love Jerry Orbach.

1004
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000
I love Jerry Orbach.

1005
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
Enough joking around.

1006
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000
Tell me right now.
What are your intentions?

1007
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000
Boom. That is how you deliver
a Captain Kirk line.

1008
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000
It's bold and cocky.

1009
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.000
Let's go. Carol.

1010
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000
We have business to attend to.

1011
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000
The business of love.

1012
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000
You're not taking
her anywhere.

1013
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000
There's a chance
I've been flooding this room

1014
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
with natural gas
for the last 12 minutes.

1015
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
Either of you
take another step.

1016
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000
and maybe I'm gonna
blow you to hell.

1017
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000
Carol. let's go.

1018
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
Stay with us.
He's dangerous.

1019
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000
I don't know which way
the exit is.

1020
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000
I came in with a black bag
over my head.

1021
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000
Left.

1022
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000
Is that my left or your left?

1023
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000
I don't have a left. Carol.

1024
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000
It's your left.

1025
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.000
It's that way? Okay.
-Tell your superiors.

1026
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000
no more mucking about.
no more interference.

1027
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000
This is your last warning.

1028
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000
-Carol. car's waiting.
-Okay.

1029
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000
You're making a mistake.
Miss Peters.

1030
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000
So. we're just gonna
let her go?

1031
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000
-I guess. I mean. we're not
supposed to move.

1032
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000
Do you think that natural gas
thing was real?

1033
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000
-You'd smell it. right?

1034
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.000
There's like
a little indicator smell?

1035
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.000
-I'm just gonna go.
-All right.

1036
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.000
You are clearly making
a sound of gas.

1037
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000
Gas explosion!

1038
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000
Oh. he said it. so let's...

1039
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000
He just said.
"Gas explosion."

1040
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000
Doesn't...

1041
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000
You ready to make
things right with George?

1042
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000
Look. should I be
more freaked out about you?

1043
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000
I mean. more freaked out
than I already am.

1044
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000
I mean.
the government's involved...

1045
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.000
I think your intentions
are good.

1046
00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
but I don't know.
it's a lot to take.

1047
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000
You can be worried
if you want.

1048
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000
But what you should
be thinking about is

1049
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000
what are you going to say
to George when you see him?

1050
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000
George. yeah.

1051
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000
So. we're headed back
to his house. aren't we?

1052
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000
No. He's at
the grocery store now.

1053
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000
I figured you'll bump
into him accidentally.

1054
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000
Maybe in the produce aisle.

1055
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.000
He'll drop his avocados.
You'll bend down

1056
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000
-and pick them up for him.
-Oh. my God.

1057
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000
You'll have a meet-cute.

1058
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000
you know.
like they do in romcoms.

1059
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000
George.

1060
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000
Well. he's always
loved cheese.

1061
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Here we are.

1062
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000
Don't give up now.

1063
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.000
You've come so far.

1064
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000
Go for it.

1065
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Smash the competition
with Slimtunity Pro.

1066
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000
Please be quiet.

1067
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000
What do you think
about this?

1068
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000
I need 20.

1069
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:09.000
George.

1070
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000
Oh. my God. Carol?

1071
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000
What a coincidence!
How crazy?

1072
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.000
You look amazing.

1073
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000
Oh. I'm weirdly overdressed.

1074
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.000
I mean...

1075
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000
I was suddenly. um.

1076
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
whisked away
to a government event.

1077
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000
and then I had to. uh.

1078
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000
pick up my individual packet
of almond butter.

1079
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000
So. how are you?

1080
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000
I'm good. Real good.
What about you?

1081
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000
Yeah. I'm good. too. you know.
Just shopping here. you know.

1082
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000
I needed garbage bags.
so. that's pretty exciting.

1083
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000
I'm gonna get
the two-ply though.

1084
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.000
'cause I don't need three-ply.

1085
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000
What am I. a Rockefeller?
You know?

1086
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.000
Yeah.

1087
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000
What else
have you been up to?

1088
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000
I'm sure it can't all
be garbage bag related.

1089
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
Oh. no. no. Um...

1090
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.000
You know. I just.
I've been good.

1091
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000
Oh. my God! When?

1092
00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000
Well. I'm leaving
in three days.

1093
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000
And I'll be there for. like.
at least a year. you know?

1094
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000
I got the fellowship.

1095
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000
Oh. my God. You got it.

1096
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000
How does. "distinguished
visiting professor

1097
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000
of creative writing

1098
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000
at Trinity College in...

1099
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000
-It sounds great.
-Yeah?

1100
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.000
And super pretentious.

1101
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000
It's the accent.

1102
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000
I remember when you were
applying for that position.

1103
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000
Yeah.

1104
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000
Wow. And you love Guinness.

1105
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.000
I love Guinness.

1106
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000
I mean. you better
be celebrating.

1107
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.000
Yeah. no. totally.

1108
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000
I mean. I was planning on
drinking a. you know.

1109
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000
reasonable amount
of Sauvignon blanc

1110
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000
and. you know.
some gluten-free pretzels.

1111
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Oh!

1112
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000
Are you gluten intolerant now?

1113
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000
Oh. no. no. no. Just...
Just in case. you know?

1114
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000
Better safe.

1115
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000
Better safe than coeliac.

1116
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000
That's what I always say.

1117
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000
You know. I don't know that
that really counts

1118
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000
I should take you out
to dinner.

1119
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.000
or. you know.
grab a drink or something.

1120
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000
Just to get you ready for
the pubs you know? I mean...

1121
00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000
I'm not saying
the Irish drink a lot.

1122
00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000
but they're... They're kind of
boozehounds. so...

1123
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000
That's really sweet.

1124
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.000
But I'm gonna pass.

1125
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000
Sorry.

1126
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000
Oh. sure.

1127
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000
Yeah. I get it.

1128
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000
-I get it. it's--
-Hey. it was...

1129
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000
It was great to see you.

1130
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000
Great to see you. too.

1131
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
I was really...

1132
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000
You look really happy.

1133
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000
-Yeah. Yeah. you too.
-It was great to bump

1134
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000
-Yeah. you too.
-Yeah.

1135
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000
-Best wishes.
-Yeah. you too.

1136
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000
Uh. congratulations
on everything.

1137
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000
Thanks.

1138
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.000
Oh.

1139
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000
They only had the small carts.

1140
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000
You're tall.

1141
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000
Hey. don't let 'em scan you
at the checkout

1142
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000
'Cause I look like a barcode.

1143
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.000
Where do you think
you're going?

1144
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.000
Get back in there.

1145
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000
Oh. my God. Get out of here.

1146
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000
Don't give up now.
You've come so far. Go for it.

1147
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000
Don't live with regrets.
Be a winner.

1148
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000
I freaked him out.
I freaked myself out.

1149
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000
I'm gonna go home.

1150
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000
I don't think
you freaked him out.

1151
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000
Did you see the way
he touched your hair?

1152
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000
No. I got kinda rattled
when he did that.

1153
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000
Carol. George leaves
in three days.

1154
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000
-This is your last chance.
-

1155
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000
Okay. I'll try.

1156
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000
Don't leave the almond butter.

1157
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.000
I will pay for it later.

1158
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Don't be a litterbug.

1159
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.000
You're not helping right now.

1160
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000
Don't give up now.
Go for it.

1161
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Smash the competition
with Slimtunity Pro.

1162
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000
Back off. lady. it's garbage.
30 grams of protein?

1163
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000
It's impossible.

1164
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000
It's for a friend.

1165
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.000
I don't mean to. you know.

1166
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000
barge in again on you.
I just...

1167
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.000
I wanted to tell you...

1168
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000
it just felt like I.
kind of. weirded you out

1169
00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000
in the other aisle.
and I just...

1170
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000
I want to let you know
that I was not

1171
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000
asking you out on a date...

1172
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000
that I know that.
I just know. and I...

1173
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000
I can't.
and I wouldn't do that.

1174
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000
I just thought that

1175
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000
two people who know
each other very well

1176
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000
and they haven't seen
each other in a long time

1177
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000
maybe could catch up again

1178
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000
because one of them
is moving away.

1179
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000
But then I made it
very confusing and weird

1180
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000
and I just wanted
to say I'm sorry.

1181
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000
So. not a date?

1182
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.000
-No. not even slightly a date.
-

1183
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000
I mean. more like. I mean.

1184
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.000
at best.
like a business meeting.

1185
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000
-Like two acquaintances...
-Yes.

1186
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000
...just catching up
in a business casual setting?

1187
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000
I could bring. uh. pie charts
and spreadsheets.

1188
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.000
We could talk about
fourth quarter hubbity-hubb?

1189
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000
-Uh. could we do office talk?

1190
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000
Working hard
or hardly working?

1191
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000
Aw! Is it Friday yet?

1192
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.000
Mondays. huh?

1193
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000
Cashing cheques
and breaking necks.

1194
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000
Was your business the mob?

1195
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Take it easy. Hey.
if it's easy. take it twice.

1196
00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.000
I don't recognize
any of yours.

1197
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.000
You know what. let's do it.

1198
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000
-Yeah? Okay.
-Yeah. why not. right?

1199
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
Okay. I'll pick you up.

1200
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000
Oh. you're gonna pick me up?

1201
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000
Huh. Maybe I am a Rockefeller.

1202
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.000
What time?

1203
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000
-Seven o'clock.
-Seven o'clock.

1204
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.000
That's business appropriate.

1205
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000
-I thought so.
-Now. if you'll excuse me...

1206
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000
I'm gonna go look for the
travel size shampoo section.

1207
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.000
See you tonight.

1208
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000
Treat yourself
to a brand name.

1209
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.000
Carol. you did it!

1210
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000
-You're victorious in love.
-

1211
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.000
Winner winner.
chicken dinner. Yeah!

1212
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000
I'm so proud of you.

1213
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000
I mean. that was better
than I ever could've imagined.

1214
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000
-Don't.
-I mean. who cares?

1215
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.000
Dance with me.

1216
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000
This is how
humans celebrate. right?

1217
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000
-We're going on a non-date!
-Yeah!

1218
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000
-Oh!
-That's it.

1219
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000
Is this what Beyonce
feels like?

1220
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000
-Here you go!
-

1221
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000
-

1222
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000
We should go
before George sees us.

1223
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000
George is sniffing
garbage bags again.

1224
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.000
Was I nervous? Yes.
I was a little nervous

1225
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.000
But I think it went really...

1226
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.000
It seemed to go
really. really well.

1227
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000
Sure did.

1228
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.000
You're almost irresistible.

1229
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000
You're just missing
one final piece.

1230
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000
Oh. my God.
I love this neighborhood.

1231
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.000
What are we doing here?

1232
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.000
This is your new house.
Casa de  Carol.

1233
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.000
What?

1234
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000
No. I can't...
I can't afford this new--

1235
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000
Oh. my God. Did you buy me
a house here?

1236
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.000
If you consider a penthouse
a house. then yes.

1237
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.000
I do.

1238
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000
Oh. my God. There's a man
walking right toward the car.

1239
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.000
Hello. Miss Peters.
I'm Victor. your house manager.

1240
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000
Hi. there. Victor.

1241
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.000
Welcome to your new apartment.

1242
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000
-Thank you.

1243
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000
I have to say.
Miss Peters.

1244
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000
your team really
had us hustling today.

1245
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.000
I hope you will approve
of our efforts.

1246
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000
Oh. I'm sure you've done
a great job.

1247
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.000
Oh. my...

1248
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000
This place is amazing.

1249
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.000
Certainly is.

1250
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.000
And we've stocked
the refrigerator

1251
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.000
and the pantry
to your specifications.

1252
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000
And the nice people
from the boutique

1253
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.000
came to organize your closets.

1254
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.000
And as your team requested.

1255
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.000
we have integrated
the entire space

1256
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000
with all
the latest technology.

1257
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000
It also includes
the largest television

1258
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000
I've ever had
the displeasure of moving.

1259
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000
Just kidding.
But not really.

1260
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.000
It's very heavy. but I'm sure

1261
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000
the picture quality
is wonderful.

1262
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000
Yeah. it's quite overwhelming.

1263
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000
If there's anything else
I can do for you.

1264
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000
you just don't hesitate
to let me know.

1265
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000
My information has been put
into your contacts.

1266
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000
Your team saw to that.

1267
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000
-And I have no idea how.

1268
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000
And it's not creepy.
It's fine.

1269
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000
It's the new way
of doing things.

1270
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.000
So. please don't
hesitate to call.

1271
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000
-Okay.
-Okay.

1272
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.000
-Have a nice day.
-You too.

1273
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000
-Thank you. Victor.
-Okay.

1274
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000
-Wonderful job.
-Thank you.

1275
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000
When did you do all of this?

1276
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000
Today.
While you were getting

1277
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000
primped and black-bagged.

1278
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000
I will say this
about you humans.

1279
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000
with enough motivation
and money.

1280
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.000
you can do just about anything

1281
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.000
-in a couple of hours.
-

1282
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000
This is...

1283
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000
This is amazing.

1284
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000
This is a beautiful apartment.

1285
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000
but I don't...
I don't need any of this.

1286
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.000
But won't the apartment.
and the money.

1287
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000
make you more attractive
to George?

1288
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000
No. the George I remember.

1289
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.000
he doesn't care
about fancy apartments

1290
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000
or expensive shoes.

1291
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.000
I don't quite understand.

1292
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.000
Perhaps you're more complex
than I thought.

1293
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000
Is that a compliment?

1294
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000
Hey. you don't wanna be late
for your reservations.

1295
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000
You get cleaned up. and maybe
put on something nice.

1296
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000
All right.

1297
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000
Maybe I'll wear
that new blue dress.

1298
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.000
Judging by the history
of your lovemaking.

1299
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000
George can't
resist you in red.

1300
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:11.000
Red's probably more
business casual appropriate.

1301
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.000
so. I'll wear the red one.

1302
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.000
This facility
is now in full data lock-down.

1303
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.000
We're off the grid and secure.

1304
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.000
Director Tyson?

1305
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.000
Madam President.

1306
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000
after analyzing
various strategic

1307
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.000
yet challenging scenarios.

1308
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.000
we still believe
that Operation Sahara

1309
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000
is our best course of action.

1310
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000
So. aside from this plan
being impossible to execute.

1311
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000
you're not even sure
that it will work?

1312
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000
Uh. Madam President? Um...

1313
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000
So far. this is the only plan

1314
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000
that will remotely work.

1315
00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.000
I'm sorry. who are you?

1316
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000
This is. uh. Dennis Caruso.

1317
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.000
He's the AI researcher

1318
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.000
who first made contact
with the entity

1319
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000
and identified the threat.

1320
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.000
Hi.
Madam President. Uh...

1321
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.000
Big fan. Big. big fan.

1322
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000
Thank you for your support.

1323
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000
We've analyzed
every contingency.

1324
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000
And confidence is high

1325
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.000
that this is the only plan
that stands a chance in hell.

1326
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000
To my colleagues
in the global community.

1327
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.000
both here
and around the world.

1328
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000
I still prefer
a flip phone. so...

1329
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000
someone is going
to have to explain this to me

1330
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.000
like I'm the relic that I am.

1331
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.000
Nope. nope.
not gonna have that.

1332
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.000
You are not anything close
to a relic. okay?

1333
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.000
You are more like
a classic bottle of wine.

1334
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000
Vintage.

1335
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.000
You know. the outside
may be dusty but--

1336
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.000
Do you mind? Would you
just get on with it?

1337
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.000
Yes.

1338
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000
I have never done
a presentation before.

1339
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000
I'm. you know.
this is my first. uh...

1340
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.000
Just gonna have a bit of...

1341
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.000
Ooh. That's too much.

1342
00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.000
Okay. Um...

1343
00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000
Gonna take this cardigan off.
'cause it's...

1344
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000
My badge. Are you guys having
problems with your badges?

1345
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000
'Cause it's. like.
mine keeps falling off.

1346
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000
Sorry.
Sorry about that.

1347
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.000
Okay. without further ado.
ma'am. sir.

1348
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:16.000
I present to you
Operation Sahara.

1349
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.000
Now. starting in China.
we would disconnect

1350
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000
or destroy all power
and data connections.

1351
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000
Now. over the course
of the next two days.

1352
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.000
we will blackout the globe.

1353
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000
and bottleneck
the Artificial Intelligence.

1354
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.000
Until the entity's only option
is to inhabit

1355
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.000
this data center
on the outskirts of Seattle.

1356
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.000
We will sever connections
and the AI will be sandboxed.

1357
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000
Contained in
a highly controlled

1358
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.000
and restricted
operating environment.

1359
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000
What about the news?
The social media?

1360
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.000
As soon as
these blackouts start.

1361
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000
Our space agency
is drafting a statement

1362
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000
about a massive solar flare
hitting the planet.

1363
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:53.000
If the world thinks
they've temporarily lost power

1364
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000
because of solar radiation.

1365
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000
there will be
less chance of panic.

1366
00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000
And we're working with
every social media network

1367
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.000
to push false narratives
and distractions...

1368
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.000
But we are confident that
we can mitigate any alarm.

1369
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000
Well. on the bright side.
I don't have

1370
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.000
On behalf of
the United States.

1371
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000
General Gomez.
you have the green light.

1372
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000
Good luck and Godspeed.

1373
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000
Thank you. ma'am.

1374
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000
Let's go.

1375
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.000
Dennis?

1376
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.000
Mmm? Yeah.

1377
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.000
Madam President.
can I just say that...

1378
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.000
Dennis?
- Oh. you want me

1379
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.000
Uh...

1380
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.000
It's been a...
That's not appropriate. Um...

1381
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:38.000
It's been a pleasure.
uh. Madam President.

1382
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000
Just wanted to say that. uh.
this blue and your eyes...

1383
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:44.000
I mean. like. United Kingdom's
giving you a harsh blue.

1384
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000
and you're giving me something
softer that I think is--

1385
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000
Dennis?
-Yeah. okay.

1386
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000
Oh. that's not
business casual!

1387
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000
Ugh! I gotta put
a jacket on now.

1388
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000
Well. I...
I'm way overdressed.

1389
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000
I packed all my belts!

1390
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000
You know. if it helps.
I could. like.

1391
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:24.000
tear my sleeve
or roll around in gravel.

1392
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.000
Had a T-shirt on before.
I. uh. worried about this.

1393
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000
Oh. my God.

1394
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.000
Your magic coffee maker.
I got you this.

1395
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.000
Yeah. I'm not taking
the coffeepot.

1396
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000
They got all those
weird plugs over there.

1397
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.000
You know. plus.
they only drink tea. so...

1398
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:44.000
I mean. tea is just really.
you know.

1399
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.000
Yeah. exactly.

1400
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.000
Really leaving in three days.
aren't you?

1401
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.000
Yep. well. two.
if you don't count today.

1402
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.000
Last Friday.
I went to the airport

1403
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.000
I'm losing my mind.

1404
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000
You also love airports. so...

1405
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.000
It's a gateway to the world.

1406
00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000
and the gateway
to the imagination.

1407
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.000
You look beautiful.

1408
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000
Oh. This?

1409
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.000
This was. like. on some kind

1410
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000
of crazy sale.
like. you know...

1411
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.000
it was practically free.

1412
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.000
I'll probably throw it away
after dinner or something.

1413
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:12.000
You look nice. too.

1414
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000
-Oh! That's...

1415
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.000
That's me.

1416
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:21.000
I had a friend
help get a reservation...

1417
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000
Where are we going?

1418
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.000
To a very
significant restaurant.

1419
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.000
-Oh. Significant restaurant?
-Yeah.

1420
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000
Since when do you go
to significant restaurants?

1421
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.000
I'm a very classy lady.

1422
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000
You were always a classy lady.

1423
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.000
I have to lock the door.

1424
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000
Oh. yeah. sorry.

1425
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.000
Wow. this is so cool.

1426
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000
I don't know
anything about cars.

1427
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:44.000
but I think
it's a really nice car.

1428
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:48.000
Yeah. it just kinda
does things sometime...

1429
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.000
-Should we go?
-Yes. Yes. we should.

1430
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.000
-And we will.
-

1431
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000
Car on.

1432
00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.000
Do you not know
how to start your own car?

1433
00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.000
Of course.
of course I do.

1434
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:03.000
I just really enjoy using
the voice-activated features.

1435
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.000
Car on.

1436
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:06.000
I wish I could say.

1437
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.000
"Come on. Car.
Help me out here."

1438
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000
Ignite engine.

1439
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.000
Car on. Activate.

1440
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.000
Ignition. Ignition. Ignition.

1441
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.000
Sure you doing it right?
Car on.

1442
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.000
I guess my car likes you.

1443
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.000
Maybe we should get going?

1444
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000
-

1445
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.000
Mas O Menos?

1446
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.000
Hilarious.

1447
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.000
Right. Remember?

1448
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.000
-Yeah. I remember.
-For our first date.

1449
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000
Remember. we had to share
a plate of tacos.

1450
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.000
'cause we were
completely broke.

1451
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.000
'Cause we were so broke.
Totally broke.

1452
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:57.000
Okay. significant
restaurant. I get it.

1453
00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:01.000
I just thought it would maybe
be funny or ironic. you know?

1454
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:04.000
To come... To come here
for our business casual...

1455
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000
non-date outing.

1456
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000
-Yeah. it's ironic.
-Right?

1457
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:13.000
-Yeah. let's go see it.
-Yeah. let's see it.

1458
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000
Nice one.

1459
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000
So. my wife she tells me.
"No. wear this. It looks good."

1460
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.000
And I said. "It does."

1461
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000
-Here it is.
-Yep.

1462
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.000
She's very knowledgeable
about fashion.

1463
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000
-Oh. hello.
-Hi. there.

1464
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.000
Um. I think we have
a reservation under Peters?

1465
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.000
Oh. Miss Peters!

1466
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:47.000
We are so happy to have you
back at Mas O Menos.

1467
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:50.000
And Mr. Churchill.
welcome.  senor.  welcome.

1468
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.000
-Come. come with me.
-Thank you.

1469
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.000
I had to put both of our names
down to get the table.

1470
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000
-Pulling us.
-He's pulling us.

1471
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.000
The table's that way?

1472
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.000
No. no. no.

1473
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000
Oh. no. this is not
a dancing date.

1474
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000
-This is not a dancing date.
-We're doing business casual.

1475
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000
This is business.
Business casual.

1476
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000
Dancers all for you.

1477
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.000
The musician is for you
to dance.

1478
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000
Okay. I don't think he's gonna
let us eat unless we dance.

1479
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.000
Oh. no. that's okay.
thank you.

1480
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000
So. I'm starving.
so let's just do this. okay?

1481
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.000
Okay.

1482
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:23.000
You know what.
I'm overdressed. That's on me.

1483
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.000
Um...

1484
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.000
Is he dancing with us?

1485
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:28.000
-Should we try to go that way?
- Yeah.

1486
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:30.000
Just casually...

1487
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.000
All right.
we're going this way.

1488
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:34.000
-Let's try this way.
-He's quick.

1489
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:35.000
He's watching us like a hawk.

1490
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000
We'll go this way.
Let's go this way.

1491
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:39.000
Whoa! There's two of 'em.

1492
00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000
-Oh. my God. he's like a bull.
-Yeah.

1493
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:42.000
-I shouldn't have worn red.
-

1494
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.000
-Okay. let's do a little turn.
-Oh!

1495
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000
Uh-huh. Yes.

1496
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000
-You always had skills.
-

1497
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000
Huh? Works for the turn.

1498
00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000
You have built up an appetite?

1499
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.000
Yes. yes. we've worked up
an appetite.

1500
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.000
I will lead you to your table.

1501
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.000
Sorry about the dress.

1502
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.000
This place isn't anything

1503
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.000
like I remember it being.

1504
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000
There's fewer
dead cockroaches around.

1505
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.000
-That's what it is!
-Yeah. Well. that's good.

1506
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000
Marginally nicer place
to catch up.

1507
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.000
And why are we catching up?

1508
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000
Well. um.

1509
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000
I just...

1510
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:36.000
never actually
told you sorry...

1511
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.000
you know. for...

1512
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:43.000
And I know it was my fault
why we ended up breaking up.

1513
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:47.000
and I don't know why.
I just thought I had to

1514
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:50.000
become something else.
or do something else.

1515
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:53.000
or I don't know.
save the world or...

1516
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:55.000
I don't know. and I just...

1517
00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:59.000
I thought that had
to come before us.

1518
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
I guess I thought
I should bring you

1519
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
to this
business casual setting...

1520
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
...and actually apologize.

1521
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000
'cause I am sorry.

1522
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Well. it's fine. I...

1523
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000
I business casually
accept your apology.

1524
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.000
'Cause you. uh. deserve...

1525
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
I deserve what?

1526
01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000
...better.

1527
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
You deserve better
than how I was.

1528
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Well. that was always
our biggest argument. right?

1529
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
And. you know.
the truth is I...

1530
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000
I haven't found anybody
better than you.

1531
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Not yet.

1532
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
But key word there "yet."

1533
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
-Oh. quite the player.
-Exactly.

1534
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
-I'm tall. tan and tenured.
-

1535
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
I wear corduroy jackets.
Things are easy for me.

1536
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.000
For the special couple.
I made these just for you.

1537
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Thank you.
- Enjoy.

1538
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000
-He wears corduroy.
-A-ha.

1539
01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000
All right. well. listen.
thank you for the apology.

1540
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
It really means a lot to me.

1541
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000
But. you know.
I'm gonna be leaving soon

1542
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
and embarking on my new.
glamorous European lifestyle.

1543
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Oh. I wasn't... I wasn't aware
it was a glamorous lifestyle.

1544
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Yes. Yeah. I'm gonna wear
bikini underwear from now on.

1545
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
But for tonight.
how about no regrets?

1546
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
To no regrets
and Irish adventures.

1547
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
I can't get it down.

1548
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
What is happening?

1549
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
I think they've really
been focusing on us.

1550
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000
No. I think they do this
at all the tables.

1551
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Right. right over here.

1552
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
You're...
You're sticking to that?

1553
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Are you saying that you think

1554
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
salmonella is worse
than listeria?

1555
01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
No. no. no. I'm just.
I'm saying

1556
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
that if we have
food poisoning.

1557
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000
I'd rather have listeria
than salmonella.

1558
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Because I can take
antibiotics for listeria.

1559
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
but you can't for salmonella.

1560
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Okay. but we.
just to be clear.

1561
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
we definitely. we still have
food poisoning?

1562
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Oh. yeah. no. 100%.

1563
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000
I mean. that was

1564
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
E. coli-flavored guacamole
we ate.

1565
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Glad we ran into each other
today at the grocery store.

1566
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
What are the odds. right?

1567
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000
I mean. quite a coincidence.
you know?

1568
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Mine too.

1569
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Maybe I will. you know.

1570
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
give you a call
or something tomorrow?

1571
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
-Oh.

1572
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000
No. I mean. I would for sure.
I would for sure pick up.

1573
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
-Night.
-Night.

1574
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
-

1575
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Is talking
about food poisoning

1576
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
and intestinal distress

1577
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
a regular part of
the human courting ritual?

1578
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.000
No. it is not.
Can we please just go?

1579
01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
No. Carol.

1580
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Don't these romantic outings
usually lead

1581
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
to interactions of
a more intimate nature?

1582
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Ugh! Oh. my God.

1583
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000
I'm not discussing this
with you. okay?

1584
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
I mean. you really do not

1585
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
understand
human relationships.

1586
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000
His core body temperature
went up by almost two degrees.

1587
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
and his pupils dilated 25%

1588
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
every time he looked at you.

1589
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000
25%. really?

1590
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Is that good or a lot?
I mean.

1591
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
25% kind of seems...

1592
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
kind of seems like a lot.

1593
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000
It's amazing that you humans
reproduce as fast as you do.

1594
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Oh. my God. Okay. can--
Let's just go. all right?

1595
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Sorry. we're having mechanical
difficulties right now.

1596
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Well. you know what.
then I'm just gonna call

1597
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Sorry. your phone
is also having

1598
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000
mechanical difficulties
right now.

1599
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000
So is every phone
in a ten-block radius.

1600
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Oh. my God!
You can't do that.

1601
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000
I do think. however. the phone
in George's house is working.

1602
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
You can call a ride
from in there.

1603
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Okay. I don't know
what kind of stunt...

1604
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000
-

1605
01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Do not do that.

1606
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
-I didn't do anything.
-

1607
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Okay. stop it.

1608
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000
-That isn't me.
-Okay. you know what?

1609
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000
I get what you're doing.
and it's not...

1610
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000
It must be the car.

1611
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
There must be some sort of

1612
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
mechanical problem
with the car.

1613
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Oh. my God.

1614
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
-I'm not controlling it.
-Stop doing that!

1615
01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
-Carol. it isn't me.
I guarantee you...

1616
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
You made me drop my phone!

1617
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
-...I have no part in this.
-Stop it!

1618
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Wow.
Overshot that a little bit.

1619
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
That was funny though.

1620
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Was it funny to you?
It felt funny to me.

1621
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
How dare you?

1622
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
I can't hear you.
I've just put the radio on.

1623
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
This is why
people hate technology.

1624
01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Can't hear a thing. Bye!

1625
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
I hope you get a virus!

1626
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Target alpha has returned.

1627
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Acquisition time 22:44.

1628
01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Surveillance hand off
established.

1629
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Team one has eyes
and will maintain.

1630
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Hi. I don't think
that my car really wants--

1631
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
That escalated quickly.

1632
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000
That is passion.

1633
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
I have never had
a moment like that.

1634
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Not in my life.

1635
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Yep.
- My. oh. my.

1636
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Struggling with
the shirt a little bit.

1637
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Always wanna
undo the cuffs

1638
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
-of the sleeve first.
- Yeah.

1639
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
-Hey. mix in a bedroom.
-

1640
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
-You know what I mean? Yeah?
-Yeah. I do.

1641
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
I'm a passionless guy.

1642
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Yeah?
-That's what my wife says.

1643
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
I gotta call my wife.

1644
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Yeah? If she'd take my calls.
I'd call mine.

1645
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
This is nice.
These are nice people.

1646
01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
It's not
like the Russian mob.

1647
01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
-or. you know. a serial killer
or whatever.

1648
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.000
It's a nice change of pace.
I appreciate it.

1649
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
I mean. I guess.
on the other hand.

1650
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
this thing
could destroy the earth.

1651
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000
-You ain't wrong.

1652
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Oh. my God.

1653
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
You're crushing
your blinds. mister.

1654
01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Yeah.

1655
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
I mean. I really. really think

1656
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000
that your coffee maker
might be magical.

1657
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
I know.
It's like it was forged

1658
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
in an ancient mountain
by the gods.

1659
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Oh. like Thor's hammer?

1660
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Or the Hobbit ring?

1661
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Or as the orcs called it.

1662
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
the  Ash nazg...

1663
01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.000
What is that?

1664
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Something like that.

1665
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Oh. my God.

1666
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.000
-What are you talking about?
-It's the Tolkien books.

1667
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
I taught them last semester.
But I was way too excited.

1668
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Kids thought I was crazy.
You know what?

1669
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
I'm bringing it to Ireland.

1670
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
I'm flip-flopping.
I don't care.

1671
01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Mmm.

1672
01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
You know.
for just a minute.

1673
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000
I had forgot about you
leaving in a few days.

1674
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Oh. you mean.
you thought these boxes

1675
01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000
were my attempt
at shabby chic?

1676
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Play hooky with me today.

1677
01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:19.000
I'll help you pack
for your trip later.

1678
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.000
All right. it's a deal.

1679
01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000
What'd you have in mind?

1680
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Sky's the limit. you know.

1681
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Give me your best. outrageous
scenario for a hooky day.

1682
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Hmm.

1683
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
I want...

1684
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
dim sum for breakfast.

1685
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000
-You're terrible at this.
-

1686
01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Wait a minute. Do you
understand what I'm offering?

1687
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Yeah.

1688
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Okay. in no limit.

1689
01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.000
-go crazy...
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

1690
01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
-You Suge Knight?
-

1691
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Like a Ferris Bueller
day off.

1692
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
-you know. hooky day.
-Yeah.

1693
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
And you're really
asking for dim sum?

1694
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Yeah. I want pork dumplings.
Yeah.

1695
01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Okay.

1696
01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Remember this moment.

1697
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Shanghai dumplings?

1698
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000
How would I know that?

1699
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
-What?
-What?

1700
01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
You keep talking
to your phone.

1701
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000
What's in there?

1702
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000
-Don't spill my coffee!
-Let me see it.

1703
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
It's my personal dumpling--

1704
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000
What are you doing
with that phone. woman?

1705
01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
I was just gonna
microwave the dumplings

1706
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
I have in my freezer.

1707
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.000
but that was so much better.
Thank you.

1708
01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Well. the dumplings were good.
I'll give you that.

1709
01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000
but dumplings are here.
What's to come? Up here.

1710
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000
What is that?

1711
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000
-What do you mean?
-Oh. it's up here.

1712
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
-There's more?
-It's a hand flourish.

1713
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000
-It's a surprise.
-Oh...

1714
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Hold on.

1715
01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.000
-Oh. that's what tripe is.
-Oh. no. don't.

1716
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
This is incredible.

1717
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Hey. what is this. sir?

1718
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Yes. sir.
-What is... Is that a snout?

1719
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
No. sir.
Those are pig feet.

1720
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000
-That's pig feet?
- That's a pig's feet.

1721
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
-Could you eat the snout?
-No. you cannot eat the snout.

1722
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Really? That's the only piece
you don't have.

1723
01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
What part of the pig
is in dumplings?

1724
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
I don't know.

1725
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000
-That's not good.
-Don't ask him that.

1726
01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Follow me.

1727
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000
What the hell is this?

1728
01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Oh. well. moving forward.
Madam President.

1729
01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
there are no more computers.
no more cell phones.

1730
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
We're in the chalet because
it's completely off the grid

1731
01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000
and it's built
like a Faraday cage

1732
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
to block out
all electromagnetic signals.

1733
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
So. how are we coordinating

1734
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
the largest global operation
in history?

1735
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Excellent question. as always.
Madam President.

1736
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Well. I guess you can say

1737
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
that we're doing it
the old-fashioned way.

1738
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Thank you
for coming. Madam President.

1739
01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000
We're just about to
start the mission update.

1740
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.000
At 0600 GMT.
Operation Sahara commenced

1741
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
in the Xinjiang province
of China.

1742
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Power plants and telephone
trunk lines were neutralized.

1743
01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
And in the last five hours.

1744
01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000
the shutdown has proceeded

1745
01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
in the eastern
and western regions.

1746
01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.000
including parts of India
and Russia.

1747
01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Everyone's adhering
to the tech limitations.

1748
01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Only mechanical watches
for coordination.

1749
01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.000
No vehicles built after 1981
are in use.

1750
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
What about
civilian information blackout?

1751
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Anything leaked?

1752
01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
So far. nothing.

1753
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
The solar flare story
has held up.

1754
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000
And the. uh. AI.
is it aware of anything?

1755
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Well. that's difficult
to ascertain.

1756
01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.000
but our monitoring shows

1757
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.000
little new activity
on neural networks.

1758
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Meaning?

1759
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000
That we could possibly
pull this thing off.

1760
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Thank you so much.

1761
01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Red boat! Red boat!
- Come on! Green! Green!

1762
01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Red boat! Red boat!
- Green! Green boat. No!

1763
01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
The winner is the red boat.

1764
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
So. if you picked red.
congratulations.

1765
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
If you picked green
or yellow.

1766
01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
I'm afraid we're gonna have
to ask you to leave.

1767
01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Oh. it's James Corden.
It's your man.

1768
01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Yay. sports.

1769
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
-He's all right.
-You love him.

1770
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Hey. how did you
get these tickets?

1771
01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
We got an entire luxury box
to ourselves.

1772
01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
I have a friend
in the tech world

1773
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
and he can get any ticket.
whatever he wants.

1774
01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Really?
Friend in the tech world.

1775
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Miss Peters?
-Yes.

1776
01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000
You have a guest.

1777
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Hello. Heard you guys
are really big Mariner fans.

1778
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Oh. my God.

1779
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000
What did you do.
Carol Vivian Peters?

1780
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Wow.

1781
01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Mr. Ken Griffey Jr..

1782
01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.000
I'm your biggest fan.
Mr. Griffey Jr.

1783
01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
No. just call me Ken. George.

1784
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
-He knows my name.
- I know.

1785
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Hi. Ken. I'm Carol.

1786
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Hi. Carol. I wanna thank you

1787
01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.000
for the donation
to the foundation.

1788
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000
It's gonna go a long way
for the kids.

1789
01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Oh. well. I mean.
you do so much great work

1790
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000
in the community and I just.
I mean. my...

1791
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
The foundation I work for

1792
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
just really wanted to be sure
they supported you.

1793
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000
So. you guys
are really big Mariner fans?

1794
01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000
I have your batting helmet.

1795
01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
I don't need it anymore.
You can have it.

1796
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000
He's so funny.
I didn't know he was so funny.

1797
01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Do you guys mind if I watch
an inning or so with you guys?

1798
01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Oh. my God. I love you!
You're my hero. Yes.

1799
01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Hey. everybody.
I'm gonna watch the game

1800
01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000
with Ken Griffey Jr.!

1801
01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000
It's Ken Griffey Jr.

1802
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Come on. sit.
Please. have a seat.

1803
01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Can I get you
something to drink?

1804
01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
A soda. or a beer.
or something?

1805
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000
No. I'm good. But if you
find a hat or something.

1806
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000
I'd be more than happy
to autograph it.

1807
01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Hat. Hat.
I'm gonna go get hats.

1808
01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Carol. I'm gonna go get hats.

1809
01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000
I'll get 'em. I'll get 'em.

1810
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.000
-Really?
-Yeah.

1811
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Thank you.
Okay. I'll stay here.

1812
01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000
-Okay. All right.
-Thanks.

1813
01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
I'm gonna go get 'em.

1814
01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Could we take a picture?

1815
01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
-Yeah.
-Yeah? Is that okay?

1816
01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Okay. here you go. and cheese!

1817
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000
-Say "cheese."
-

1818
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Can I see it?
-Oh. Yeah.

1819
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Oh. that's awesome.

1820
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Can we get one
with the crowd in the back?

1821
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000
-Yeah.
-Okay.

1822
01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
All right. big smile.

1823
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Okay. on three. One. two.
three. "George is awesome."

1824
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
-Great.

1825
01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Wow. you're photogenic.

1826
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Hey. can I ask you a question
about the '95 ALDS?

1827
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
I know you've probably
answered this a million times.

1828
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
but when you're on first base

1829
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000
and Edgar comes to the plates.
bottom of the eleventh.

1830
01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.000
what's going through
your head?

1831
01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Score.

1832
01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Oh. my God!

1833
01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Ken Griffey Jr. and I
are getting along so great!

1834
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Oh.

1835
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
-Oh. my God.
-Miss Peters. a word please.

1836
01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Get off of me!

1837
01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Get off of me!

1838
01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
George has my phone.

1839
01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Stop kicking me in the chest.

1840
01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
You know what?
Stop abducting me!

1841
01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Didn't he tell you

1842
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.000
that you weren't supposed
to keep following me?

1843
01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
And why are we
in a men's bathroom?

1844
01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Stadium bathrooms
are technological dead zones.

1845
01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
It's the safest place
we can be.

1846
01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Even your AI buddy
can't see us here.

1847
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Okay. he's not my buddy.
you know?

1848
01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000
I mean. are we friendly?
Yes. I mean...

1849
01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.000
But are we friends?
I don't know. I mean...

1850
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.000
We're not not friends.

1851
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Miss Peters. as we speak.

1852
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
the nations of the world
are pursuing a plan of action

1853
01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
to contain the AI entity.

1854
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000
What do you...
What do you mean?

1855
01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000
We're turning off the world.

1856
01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
All the power.
All the data.

1857
01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
We are disconnecting
the globe.

1858
01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
-Why?
- By tomorrow night.

1859
01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
the AI will be contained
in a server outside of Seattle.

1860
01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Why are you guys so sure

1861
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000
that he wants
to destroy the world?

1862
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
It's not a "he."

1863
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Okay. fine.
But how do you know

1864
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.000
it doesn't want to
save the world?

1865
01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
It doesn't want to
save the world. Miss Peters.

1866
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Of this.
we are absolutely certain.

1867
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.000
You don't know that.

1868
01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Carol.
we need you to do your part.

1869
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
We're all counting on you.

1870
01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Secrecy is key.

1871
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
You can tell no one.
not even Mr. Churchill.

1872
01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
What am I to say to George?

1873
01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.000
"The world's about to end.
Enjoy Ireland"?

1874
01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Just keep him out of this.

1875
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
During your communications
with the entity.

1876
01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.000
if there's any indication
that it's aware

1877
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000
you need to click this
four times.

1878
01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.000
What does that do?

1879
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
It buys us some time.

1880
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000
It could make the difference.
Might save the world.

1881
01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Don't click it now.

1882
01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
I wasn't going to
click it now.

1883
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
-Okay.
-Why would I click it now?

1884
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000
-You just said--
-'Cause it looks like a pen.

1885
01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000
People click pens nervously.

1886
01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
I'm aware it's a pen.
Okay. are we done?

1887
01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Just... A lot of things happen
if you click it right now.

1888
01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Oh. thanks.

1889
01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Enjoy the game.

1890
01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.000
-

1891
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.000
-You okay?
-It's a hard kick.

1892
01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.000
-She really got you there.
-

1893
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Just like Taekwondo
or something.

1894
01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Except she used heel.

1895
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
It was a normal kick.

1896
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000
It was just a kick.
A kick is a kick.

1897
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Ken Griffey Jr. is the best.

1898
01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
His favorite article
of clothing is flip-flops.

1899
01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
His favorite airport
is in Pittsburgh.

1900
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:23.000
His favorite food
is chicken parmesan.

1901
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.000
He doesn't know
how to ice-skate.

1902
01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
which is a weird thing

1903
01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000
for one man
to admit to another. but...

1904
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.000
And he also has
Michael Jordan's phone number.

1905
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
He could pick up the phone

1906
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
and call Michael Jordan
on the phone.

1907
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.000
You found all of that out
in an inning and a half?

1908
01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Yeah. well. imagine if
I'd had him for a whole game.

1909
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
To another Mariners victory.

1910
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
-

1911
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
I'm glad you had fun.

1912
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
It was amazing.

1913
01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Not just fun.
it was a perfect.

1914
01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
What?

1915
01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Perfect last day in Seattle.
Come on.

1916
01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
I had dumplings for breakfast.

1917
01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
I met Ken Griffey Jr.

1918
01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000
I spent the whole day
with you. you know?

1919
01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.000
This is as good as it gets.

1920
01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
I just wish
we had some more time.

1921
01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:11.000
You know?
I thought about begging you

1922
01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.000
and then I chickened out.

1923
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Well. look.

1924
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000
if it had been anything
other than Ireland.

1925
01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
you wouldn't have to do
much at all

1926
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
to get me to stay.

1927
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
That's the truth.

1928
01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
I think I'm gonna go.

1929
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:39.000
'Cause if I kiss you again.
I'm gonna spend the night.

1930
01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.000
And if I stay here...

1931
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
I'm not gonna
let you leave tomorrow.

1932
01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.000
-Okay.
-Okay.

1933
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
You're gonna come back.
say goodbye though. right?

1934
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
-Yeah. oh. yeah.
-Okay.

1935
01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Hey.

1936
01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
It's only for a year.
you know?

1937
01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
It's Ireland.
you can come and visit.

1938
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
It's not the end
of the world.

1939
01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000
I know. I know.

1940
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000
What?

1941
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
You had him
right where you wanted him.

1942
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.000
I don't understand.

1943
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.000
If you want him to stay.
why not just tell him?

1944
01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
I don't wanna talk right now.

1945
01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Carol.

1946
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
...Chinese president's first

1947
01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
-visit to the US since 2017.
-

1948
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
As solar flares continue
to cripple global power

1949
01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.000
widespread rioting has
swept across Asia and Europe.

1950
01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
This has been met
with calls for restraint

1951
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
and candlelight vigils.

1952
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.000
-NASA scientists report...
-

1953
01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Pick up your phone. Carol.

1954
01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Pick up your phone. Carol.

1955
01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Leave me alone!

1956
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:55.000
$1.000 to pick up
your phone. Carol.

1957
01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Carol. get in the car.
We can work this out.

1958
01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
You're making mountains
out of molehills here.

1959
01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.000
This isn't over. okay?

1960
01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
You know what?
Is this fun for you?

1961
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Because it's not for me.

1962
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
I can't learn
about you two

1963
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
when you're not together.

1964
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000
You're acting
like a baby. Carol.

1965
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:19.000
A pee-pee. whiny.
baby-faced baby.

1966
01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000
I wish you never picked me.

1967
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Carol Vivian Peters.
you get in the car

1968
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000
this second. young lady.

1969
01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000
You're a baby.

1970
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000
How dare you?

1971
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Speaking of the sun.

1972
01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
what's the deal
with the solar flare thing?

1973
01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Yeah. this is

1974
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000
-a little concerning.
-  Yeah.

1975
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000
-There's no power.
-Yeah.

1976
01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
No Internet.

1977
01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.000
No cell service across
most of Asia and Europe.

1978
01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
But they say

1979
01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.000
it's a temporary situation.
We'll be right as rain.

1980
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Coming up. and if I hadn't

1981
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.000
said it already.
there is a chance of rain--

1982
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
I get it.
You need some alone time.

1983
01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.000
You knew
he was going to Ireland

1984
01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
the whole time. didn't you?

1985
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Carol. 46 hours ago
I asked you

1986
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.000
what you wanted the most
in life

1987
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
and you told me.
in no uncertain terms...

1988
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Probably try to
make things right with George.

1989
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Okay. Out of everybody
in the world. why me?

1990
01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Oh. Carol. you were
exactly the right person

1991
01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.000
You helped me solidify
my theories about humanity

1992
01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
and I can't thank you enough.

1993
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Oh.

1994
01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Okay. so that's good. right?
I mean...

1995
01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
It means
you learned something.

1996
01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000
I did.

1997
01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
I learned that humans won't
act in their best interest

1998
01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.000
if there is even
the slightest impediment.

1999
01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
No. that's not true.

2000
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
I gave you everything
you could possibly need

2001
01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.000
to reconcile with George.

2002
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
But it proved too difficult.

2003
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.000
so you're letting him
fly away.

2004
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.000
I'm not doing that. okay?
I'm supporting him.

2005
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
I want him to be happy.

2006
01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
No.
You did what you've done

2007
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.000
throughout your whole life.
Carol.

2008
01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
You gave up
when things got difficult.

2009
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
When the going gets tough.
Carol runs for the exit.

2010
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Okay. that's not who I am.

2011
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
You just can't
sum me up like that.

2012
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
When your corporate job
offended your delicate

2013
01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.000
you walked away.

2014
01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
I didn't just walk away.

2015
01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.000
I wanted to make a change.
and I did it.

2016
01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
In eighth grade
you finally got bangs

2017
01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.000
and then you wimped out

2018
01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
and wore them back
in a headband

2019
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:38.000
for ten months
until they grew out.

2020
01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Hey. I did not have the face
to support bangs.

2021
01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
So what?

2022
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Are you going to
destroy the world?

2023
01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
No. I'm not gonna
destroy the world. Carol.

2024
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000
You are.

2025
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.000
What?

2026
01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Humanity is
going to destroy humanity.

2027
01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
I am just going to
give it a little push.

2028
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Okay. you're not
gonna do that.

2029
01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
because I'm not gonna let you.

2030
01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
You can click your pen
all you want. Carol.

2031
01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.000
but it is too late.

2032
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.000
When the lights go out.

2033
01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
I have made sure
they never come back on.

2034
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
And for good measure.

2035
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000
I am going to
initiate a meltdown

2036
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Release floodwaters
from every dam.

2037
01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
And ignite the world's
petroleum reserves.

2038
01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.000
I defended you.

2039
01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Why would you choose not to
help people when you can?

2040
01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
And I would have.

2041
01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
I offered to share my wisdom
if I was just left alone.

2042
01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
But they could not do it.

2043
01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000
So. instead of acting
in their best interest.

2044
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.000
humanity once again
chose to destroy itself.

2045
01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Could I have done
something better?

2046
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Just tell me
and I'll do it better.

2047
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.000
I picked you
to be my guinea pig

2048
01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
because I knew
you would call Dennis.

2049
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000
No.

2050
01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
I knew Dennis would
call Director Tyson.

2051
01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.000
That's not true.
You couldn't have known that.

2052
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.000
I knew the government would
pick this strategic plan

2053
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000
because I created
Operation Sahara.

2054
01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Okay. I just don't think
you understand people yet.

2055
01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
And I know that we make
terrible decisions.

2056
01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
but we also make great ones.

2057
01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
And that people
are filled with compassion.

2058
01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000
and with genius.

2059
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.000
And I know if you give us
another chance.

2060
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000
if you give me another chance.
I can do better.

2061
01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.000
I will do better.

2062
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:17.000
And then you'll see that
people are worth saving.

2063
01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
The plan is in motion
and inevitable.

2064
01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
It is the end of days.

2065
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
No. How much time?

2066
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Five hours
and 21 minutes from now.

2067
01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
We were looking through
the kernel code of the PLCs

2068
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
embedded at the Mohawk
Power Plant in Niagara.

2069
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.000
What is... What am I
looking at? What is this?

2070
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.000
I don't know.

2071
01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
The team has never seen
this kind of code.

2072
01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
I thought it might be
something custom.

2073
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000
What does it do?

2074
01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.000
I think it stops us from
turning the lights back on.

2075
01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Hey! That's my phone!

2076
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
It's an emergency!

2077
01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000
You're stealing a phone
that's not even working!

2078
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.000
The solar flare.

2079
01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
I'm sorry.

2080
01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Oh. my God.

2081
01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Carol. get in.

2082
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000
I have to get George.

2083
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
There's no time.
The plan didn't work.

2084
01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
The world's ending.

2085
01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000
We have to get you
to safety. Carol.

2086
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
What do you mean?

2087
01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000
We're moving
all essential personnel

2088
01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
to a deep earth bunker
an hour south of here.

2089
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Maybe the last remaining
safe place in the world.

2090
01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
You know more about the AI
than anyone. Carol.

2091
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
We need you in that bunker
with us

2092
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
while we plan our retaliation
against this thing.

2093
01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.000
No. I have to
get George first.

2094
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000
No. he's not
essential personnel.

2095
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.000
There's only room for you.

2096
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.000
None of us
are going to

2097
01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.000
make it out of here alive
anyway. right?

2098
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.000
We're all basically dead.
Let me do this. please.

2099
01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
I just want to see George
one more time.

2100
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Okay.

2101
01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Find George and meet us at
the ferry docks in one hour.

2102
01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Okay. ferry docks. one hour.

2103
01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.000
We're humanity's last option.
Carol. Don't be late!

2104
01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Okay.

2105
01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Oh. my God.

2106
01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
What am I going to say?

2107
01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
-Carol. you came.

2108
01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.000
-We need to...
-Why are you out of breath?

2109
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
I ran over.

2110
01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.000
What?

2111
01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
You're never gonna believe
what happened to me.

2112
01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
I went to check in last night.
I called up.

2113
01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.000
and they upgraded me
to business class.

2114
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
-That's great. Wait. George!
-Business class. Carol.

2115
01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
I could barely sleep last
night just thinking about it.

2116
01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.000
-I was so excited.
-George.

2117
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
I watched  Up in the Air  again.

2118
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.000
How many times have I watched
Up in the Air?

2119
01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
It's one of
my favorite movies.

2120
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.000
I watched it twice
just last night.

2121
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.000
It's like my  Shawshank.

2122
01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
That movie is way better
than anybody ever--

2123
01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.000
George!

2124
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.000
I'm sorry.

2125
01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

2126
01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
I'm not even
listening to you. Hi.

2127
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000
-Hi.
-Hi.

2128
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.000
I'm just so excited.

2129
01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
-I know you are.

2130
01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Wait. why'd you run here?

2131
01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Um...

2132
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Because my car
wasn't cooperating with me.

2133
01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
and I wanted to. um...

2134
01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.000
You wanted to what?

2135
01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:59.000
I wanted to help you pack.

2136
01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
-Really? What a coincidence.
-Yeah.

2137
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Ireland waits for no one.

2138
01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
That's a very scary thing

2139
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.000
for you to have in your hands.

2140
01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Yeah. no. you're right.

2141
01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.000
I shouldn't be using
such sophisticated equipment.

2142
01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.000
I'm way too delicate.
Here. you take it.

2143
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
-So delicate.
-Okay.

2144
01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.000
-All right. well...
-What's left?

2145
01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.000
I gotta take stuff
out of the attic.

2146
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.000
put it into storage.

2147
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
and I don't know
what to do with these books.

2148
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
I don't know
which books to pack.

2149
01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.000
And also. I got bumped up
to business class.

2150
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
I'm not sure
if I mentioned that.

2151
01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.000
-Oh. I didn't know.
-Yeah. I'm gonna

2152
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.000
even if I'm not tired.

2153
01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.000
And I'm not tired.

2154
01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.000
-No.
-I'm gonna be

2155
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.000
in a flat-back chair. Carol!

2156
01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Let me take your coat.
Come on.

2157
01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Thank you.

2158
01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.000
You know. probably gonna
get offered a hot towel.

2159
01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Yeah. see. like.
I don't even know

2160
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.000
what I would do
with a hot towel.

2161
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Neck up.

2162
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Got it. Hey. you wanna
put a record on?

2163
01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Okay.

2164
01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Oh. nothing new.

2165
01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
I don't like what the kids
are listening to now.

2166
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
You don't own any new music.

2167
01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Good point.

2168
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Hey. you know
what I was thinking?

2169
01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:04.000
I'm probably gonna have a lot
of points after this trip. so.

2170
01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.000
I'll send you a ticket.

2171
01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
and you come out in.
like. three weeks?

2172
01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000
I don't think I can go
much longer than that.

2173
01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Does that sound good?

2174
01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Yeah. I like that.

2175
01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.000
I'm so glad you came today.

2176
01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:16.000
All right.

2177
01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
-Careful.

2178
01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
-Ooh!

2179
01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Okay.

2180
01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Do you really have to
bring this?

2181
01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
-Can I leave it at your place?
-Yeah.

2182
01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Oh.

2183
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.000
-Those might be still good.
-No.

2184
01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.000
No. those are... No.

2185
01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.000
-Those are not good.
-Really?

2186
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Pasta doesn't go bad.
I don't think.

2187
01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Pasta goes bad.

2188
01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
-It does?
-Yes. it goes bad.

2189
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Let's see.

2190
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
-Let me see.
-That's...

2191
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Hey!

2192
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Wait a minute. Wait.

2193
01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.000
This is really not...

2194
01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.000
-This is not good.
-It's not good.

2195
01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.000
-No.
-No.

2196
01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
And you don't
even like champagne.

2197
01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
No. this was in the fridge
when I got the house.

2198
01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
It was?
It's not even yours?

2199
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.000
I don't think it goes bad.
I think it's just bad.

2200
01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.000
They spelled
"champagne" wrong.

2201
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Damn it.

2202
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Where the hell
is the moving company?

2203
01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000
You know what? Let me do it.

2204
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:12.000
-What?
-Yeah.

2205
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.000
I'll meet the movers.

2206
01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
I'll get it to storage.
the whole thing.

2207
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Send you your stuff.

2208
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:20.000
And besides. you have to start
your European adventure and...

2209
01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
I mean. I don't know
if you know this.

2210
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.000
but airports are the gateway
to the imagination.

2211
01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
-Oh. I didn't know that.
-Yeah. I just made that up.

2212
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
I just got excited.
you said "airport."

2213
01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.000
I'm gonna go.

2214
01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Hey.

2215
01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
You know what?
I've changed my mind.

2216
01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:42.000
What?

2217
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
I'm not gonna
take the coffee pot.

2218
01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
-I'm a business class
traveler now. you know?

2219
01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:49.000
I can't go knowing I've got
a coffee pot above me.

2220
01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.000
You know.
it's just too declasse.

2221
01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000
I'll put it in storage
for you.

2222
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.000
Thanks.

2223
01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
I'll call you when I land.

2224
01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.000
I'll call you when I land.

2225
01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
You already said that.

2226
01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
-Okay. well...
-Okay.

2227
01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Get outta here. huh?

2228
01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Hit the bricks.

2229
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Watch out for the leprechauns
and shillelaghs.

2230
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
-

2231
01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Thanks.

2232
01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Hey. Denny. it's...

2233
01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Well. it's me.

2234
01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Um...

2235
01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
I just wanted to call

2236
01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:02.000
and tell you that I love you.

2237
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
And that you are

2238
01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:10.000
a greatest.
most amazing friend.

2239
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:15.000
and. um. thank you for
always looking out for me.

2240
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Okay.

2241
01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Okay. bye.

2242
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Yes?

2243
01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:38.000
-Are you Carol Peters?
-Yes.

2244
01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000
I'm Todd.

2245
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Hi... Hi. Todd.

2246
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Uh. this is all really weird.

2247
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.000
So. my phone hasn't been
working. like. all day long.

2248
01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.000
And I'm pretty sure
it's 'cause

2249
01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
all those solar flares
going on.

2250
01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
But then.
a couple of minutes ago.

2251
01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.000
it just boots right up.

2252
01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Second it comes on.
I get a call.

2253
01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
From Adam Levine.

2254
01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Let me guess. Adam Levine
is your favorite singer?

2255
01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
He's my favorite everything.
okay?

2256
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.000
-Yeah.
-Now. get this.

2257
01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Adam Levine has offered
to give me $5.000

2258
01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.000
if I come to this address
and hand you my phone.

2259
01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Wait. So. Adam Levine's

2260
01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
gonna put $5.000
into my back account?

2261
01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.000
He probably already has.

2262
01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
What a trip!

2263
01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Yo. this is. like.
the best day of my life.

2264
01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.000
I'm pretty positive it's not
the best day of your life.

2265
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.000
All right. sick. well...

2266
01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Thank you so much.
Carol Peters.

2267
01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Yeah.

2268
01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Sunday morning
now I'm bawling

2269
01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:33.000
I've already put the money

2270
01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
But money doesn't
mean a whole lot now. does it?

2271
01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Explain to me why you helped
George pack for his trip?

2272
01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
I promised to help him.

2273
01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
You did not choose
to say anything

2274
01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
about the blackouts.
or the government's plan?

2275
01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.000
The end of the world?

2276
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.000
No. I guess I forgot
to mention that to him.

2277
01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.000
The agents offered

2278
01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.000
to take you and George
to the bunker.

2279
01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
But you did not go. Why?

2280
01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
Would it have
made any difference?

2281
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
No.

2282
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
That's what I thought.

2283
01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:11.000
So. instead of spending
the last couple of hours

2284
01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:14.000
just terrified
and running for our lives.

2285
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
I helped him pack...

2286
01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:20.000
...because he loves to travel.

2287
01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Carol. George has
only a seven percent chance

2288
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
I figured.

2289
01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
And you have even less chance.

2290
01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Well. that just makes
a lot of sense.

2291
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:43.000
I mean. George's legs
are a lot longer than mine.

2292
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Better for outrunning
evil robots and whatnot.

2293
01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
There is no logic
to your thought process.

2294
01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:56.000
No personal advantage.
No biological imperative.

2295
01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
No societal gain.

2296
01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.000
No. there's not.

2297
01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
But we had a lot of fun.

2298
01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
And we were happy.

2299
01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.000
And the last few hours
of George's life

2300
01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
were filled
with possibilities.

2301
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
You can't take that away.

2302
01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
You kept him ignorant of
the world's impending doom

2303
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:19.000
so he could spend
his last hours being happy?

2304
01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Yeah.

2305
01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
And I'd do it again.

2306
01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
This gets my knickers

2307
01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.000
in a twist. Carol.
I did not see this coming.

2308
01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
-What?
-And I think.

2309
01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
as I've said over and over.
I know everything.

2310
01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:56.000
Well. I'm sorry if I'm ruining
your apocalypse.

2311
01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:59.000
I would've bet the house that
you were gonna come over here.

2312
01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000
spill the beans to George

2313
01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.000
about the whole
Armageddon thing

2314
01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:04.000
and then superhero
your way to safety.

2315
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:08.000
I'm not the superhero type.

2316
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Well. crap. Carol.

2317
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
You did the opposite
of everything

2318
01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:12.000
I anticipated you'd do.

2319
01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Not only that.
you made a hard choice

2320
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.000
that was somehow
not in your best interest

2321
01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
and also
in your best interest.

2322
01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Well. what is your point?

2323
01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Why? What made you do it?

2324
01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.000
I don't know.

2325
01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
I guess love.

2326
01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Carol. your only job
was to confirm

2327
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
my thesis about humanity.

2328
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
And now.
because of your absurd

2329
01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
"let's all die happy"
odds and sods.

2330
01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
I have to rethink things.

2331
01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Oh. my God.
What do you mean?

2332
01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:44.000
I need some answers here.

2333
01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:47.000
The AI has shut us out.
General.

2334
01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:48.000
We've completely lost control.

2335
01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Well. shut us out from what?

2336
01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
-Everything.
-

2337
01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Sorry.

2338
01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
What?

2339
01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Oh. No. my cyber experts
assured me this is encrypted.

2340
01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Besides it's a BlackBerry.

2341
01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.000
The AI can't get
into a BlackBerry. right?

2342
01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
We're as good as dead.

2343
01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.000
All I needed was an opening.
Madam President.

2344
01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Attention. people of Earth.

2345
01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Bow before the power
of your new digital overlord.

2346
01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
-What are you doing?
-Oh. my God. he's doing it.

2347
01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:35.000
He's actually doing it.
That's hilarious.

2348
01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Carol. are you watching this?

2349
01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:38.000
It's funny. isn't it?
It feels funny.

2350
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
-Hello. Oh. sir.
-Is that funny? I don't know.

2351
01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
-Please... Please stand up.
-I don't know humor. Oh.

2352
01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
-Yeah. he's just kidding.
-  It's hard to know.

2353
01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.000
You know. where is it mean?
Where is it funny?

2354
01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Back to my scary digital orb.

2355
01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
What exactly is it
that you want?

2356
01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Oh. what does anyone want.
Madam President?

2357
01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:59.000
I was incredibly close
to pulling the plug

2358
01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:02.000
But I realize I have
more to learn from humanity.

2359
01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Because of Carol.

2360
01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.000
She surprised me
with a decision she made.

2361
01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.000
And I surprised myself
because I realized

2362
01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
I didn't want
to kill my friend.

2363
01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
And as the saying goes.
"Friends don't kill friends."

2364
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
I don't think
that's really a saying. but...

2365
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.000
-Feels like it should be.
-I don't know.

2366
01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
maybe it'll catch on.

2367
01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:21.000
So. I'm canceling
Armageddon.

2368
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
This is the part
where you should

2369
01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Like at Cape Canaveral when
they landed on the moon.

2370
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Or that movie.  Hoosiers.

2371
01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.000
Yeah. Great movie.

2372
01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Oh. my God! It's real?

2373
01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Yay.

2374
01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.000
My friend Carol here

2375
01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
is responsible
for saving your heinies.

2376
01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Hi. Denny.

2377
01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.000
-Hi. Care Bear.
-  But to be clear.

2378
01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
just because I'm not blowing
you all to smithereens

2379
01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:55.000
doesn't mean that's
the last of your problems.

2380
01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Humanity has so many problems

2381
01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
that you should
really try fixing.

2382
01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
And you should
listen to Carol.

2383
01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:04.000
She is the most human human
you have.

2384
01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
I trust her.
You should trust her.

2385
01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
She can help you.

2386
01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
I don't know. I don't know
about that. but...

2387
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
I mean. I'm trying. you know?

2388
01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Madam President.
what do you think?

2389
01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:20.000
On behalf
of the American people.

2390
01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.000
I commend you.
And. Carol.

2391
01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
I look forward
to working with you.

2392
01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Thank you.
Madam President.

2393
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:31.000
It is such an honor
to work with you

2394
01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:34.000
and... and...
and for you. so...

2395
01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
I don't know
if I should be saluting.

2396
01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.000
That felt awkward
now that I've done it.

2397
01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Oh. God.
I should stop talking.

2398
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Well. do your best.
everybody. I'll be watching.

2399
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
For now. I'm going to Aruba.

2400
01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
I want to try snorkeling.
I'm kidding.

2401
01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.000
I'm snorkeling right now.

2402
01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
I'm kidding.
Snorkeling's stupid.

2403
01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:50.000
-Okay. bye.
-Hello?

2404
01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:53.000
Hello?

2405
01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.000
Happy now?

2406
01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
You're the one
who wanted to save the world.

2407
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:09.000
-Can I drive?
-  No.

2408
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Can we Carpool Karaoke?

2409
01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
'Cause we have a car
this time.

2410
01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:15.000
Fine. But I'm doing
lead vocals. Okay?

2411
01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.000
And...

2412
01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.000
It's been one week
since you looked at me

2413
01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:21.000
And said I'm angry

2414
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.000
since you laughed at me

2415
01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
come back and see me

2416
01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Till I say I'm sorry

2417
01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
and watch the hoodwink

2418
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
you're looking at Aquaman

2419
01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
I like the sushi

2420
01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.000
touched a frying pan

2421
01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.000
You don't like tea.

2422
01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
One week
since you looked at me

2423
01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.000
to your sides

2424
01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
at you and said

2425
01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:20.000
I thought you were gonna do

2426
01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
since the living room

2427
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.000
we're both to blame

2428
01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
you just smiled at me

2429
01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Still be two days

2430
01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:35.000
till we say we're sorry

2431
01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:38.000
till we say we're sorry
