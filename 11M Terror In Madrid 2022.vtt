3
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.080
He always looked
for the good side of people.

4
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.840
He didn't look for material things.
the economic side or for a nice tracksuit.

5
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.080
He wouldn't criticize anybody.

6
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.480
so I thought "you're as nice
as you are dumb." It makes me mad.

7
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.560
The smell after playing football.

8
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.360
He left his shirt and they grabbed it.
Poof.

9
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.720
And he's like…
What does your mom use to wash this?

10
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.440
And. ah. I was going home from work…
I heard the news on the radio…

11
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.400
Mmm… I got really nervous.

12
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.560
A huge overwhelming sensation and…

13
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.640
seeing hours and more hours
go by and that…

14
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.560
The only one no one
had heard from was Dani.

15
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.720
The taxi driver… crying with us.

16
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.920
I still believed
that Dani was helping the victims.

17
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.800
I got home.
my father was crying.

18
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.760
And I didn't understand. I told him. hey.
it's fine. everything's fine. dad. no…

19
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.520
Everything's fine. and…

20
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.040
And I got the call about them
not being able to find Dani. But…

21
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.640
I had already talked to him. so…

22
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.680
it couldn't be and I was saying that…

23
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.360
He was going to show up
and that I'd give him a hug.

24
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.960
I wanted him to show up so badly…

25
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.040
And he never showed up.

26
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.200
Up until March 10th. 2004.

27
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.920
I was a normal person.
I think I was happy. I had a job.

28
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.440
I was able to send both
my children to college.

29
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.320
I was working on research
on new drugs to treat cancer.

30
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.880
I was a commander in the terrestrial…
terrestrial army.

31
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.760
I worked as an electrician and as plumber.

32
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.040
I was a photojournalist at Agencia EFE.

33
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.960
I was a regional dance teacher.

34
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.520
She was in a dance group. too.

35
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.000
I used to work at… the station.

36
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.640
I'm a security guard.

37
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.600
I was working as a train operator

38
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.280
at the Madrid commuter trains network.

39
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.640
Back then. I juggled

40
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.920
working as a civil servant
and I drove a taxi.

41
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.000
I had two jobs.

42
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.920
I was a completely happy girl.

43
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I didn't have any kind of problem.
everything for me was… great.

44
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.520
My life was… just like
any other 19. 20-year-old guy's.

45
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.160
I found out I was pregnant. I was happy.

46
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.640
There was nothing

47
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.400
foreshadowing that something
would happen that day

48
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.760
different from… any other day.

49
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.360
A regular working day.

50
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.560
He kissed me goodbye like every morning.

51
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.760
You have some coffee. you take a shower.

52
00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.120
You get dressed and…
you leave in a hurry to catch the train.

53
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.520
I remember I bought
the newspaper that day.

54
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.520
Because Real Madrid
had won the day before.

55
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.920
When he said goodbye.
his mother told him…

56
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.520
Aren't you going to kiss me goodbye. son?

57
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.320
As he was walking down the corridor…

58
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.960
I had this feeling…

59
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.480
And I thought. "Don't leave."

60
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.880
I saw I was about to miss the train.
so I automatically ran to catch it.

61
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.000
And I caught it.

62
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.760
When the doors closed.
we heard a very loud noise.

63
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.480
We all fell to the ground

64
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.160
and smoke came out.
I managed to get out of the wagon.

65
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.640
I looked right.

66
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.800
and to my surprise
I saw a blown-up wagon.

67
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.560
I was on the platform

68
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.760
and the wagon to my left
and the one I'd just gotten off from…

69
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.360
exploded.

70
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.400
What crossed my mind was to get out.

71
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.840
To get out of there no matter what.

72
00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.480
There is no cowardice
in a situation like that.

73
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.120
It's survival.

74
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.880
Through the security walkie-talkies

75
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.200
we were told we all had to go…

76
00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.120
downstairs…

77
00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.360
to the platforms.

78
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.880
I threw myself down to protect myself

79
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.880
and jumped to the railway on the right.

80
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.320
There a third bomb exploded.

81
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.640
and everything went black.

82
00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.400
The third explosion hit us upfront.

83
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.600
The blast threw us down.

84
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.640
I was knocked unconscious.

85
00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.320
The first shards

86
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.800
of glass hit me

87
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.240
on the left side of my face.

88
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.920
You see… horror

89
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.160
Images that I think…
no one should see.

90
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.120
I always sat in the same wagon.

91
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.240
Usually on the same seat.
right next to the window.

92
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.600
I remember the beeping sound
when the doors closed.

93
00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.360
I started the… train.

94
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.000
I didn't hear any noise.
You see a flash…

95
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.480
and smoke.

96
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.160
A black cloud enveloped me
and everything started spinning.

97
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.560
I was under a seat.

98
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.680
I couldn't see anything.

99
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.120
I started screaming. "What is this?"

100
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.320
I-it's is a bomb. It's a bomb.

101
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.200
And I remember nothing else.

102
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.680
I saw through the rear-view mirror…

103
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.560
how the second bomb…

104
00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.000
the second bomb exploded.

105
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.080
That image… I have it…

106
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.520
It's impossible to… to forget.

107
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.960
Because of the huge noise
from the blast…

108
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.120
it's almost like you're deaf.

109
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.240
You hear like
when someone talks

110
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.160
while your head is underwater.

111
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.680
That's how I was hearing.

112
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.040
I saw things that…

113
00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.000
that were really hard.

114
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.720
The first sensation was a lot of light
spinning around me

115
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.320
and that I had lost control of my body.

116
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.080
I tried to sit up. but I wasn't able to.

117
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.080
We were out and got back in
to help people out.

118
00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.880
While we were taking people out.

119
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.520
the fifth wagon exploded.

120
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.960
I don't remember anything
after that blast.

121
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.600
Ah…

122
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.120
Lord… protect me.

123
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.440
Uh… me and my family.

124
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.120
At that moment…

125
00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.520
everything… turned black.

126
00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.160
Once we got there we realized

127
00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.320
just how big the tragedy actually was.

128
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.800
First. our colleagues.
we looked at each other

129
00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.560
and we told ourselves.
"Okay. well. what is this?"

130
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.160
Where do we begin?

131
00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.520
Everything was quiet.

132
00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.800
It was dead silence.
You could only hear mobile phones.

133
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.800
When I woke up. I knew I was on the train.

134
00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.280
but I couldn't see the train anywhere.

135
00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.840
I was suddenly on the seat
that the woman next to me was in.

136
00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:27.920
I realized.

137
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.200
to my surprise.
I no longer had pants nor shoes.

138
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.440
The people who were
in front of me. who were…

139
00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.080
who were right above the bomb
were completely torn apart.

140
00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.880
My legs were cut
up to my knees.

141
00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.360
I tried to get up.
That was when I realized that…

142
00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.920
my legs…
It was impossible to get up

143
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.800
because they were completely torn apart.

144
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.160
I was in so much pain.

145
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.640
It was if my whole body had been torn…

146
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.240
my whole body. so much pain.

147
00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.000
We began to…

148
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.520
do something called triage.

149
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.320
To determine which patients

150
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.160
should receive medical attention first
depending on the injuries they have.

151
00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.600
how likely they are to… to survive.

152
00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.240
I was helping someone
and my partner. well…

153
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.440
she asked. "What can I do?"

154
00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.280
And the SAMUR physician
who was attending that person…

155
00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.120
told her. "Help him die in peace."

156
00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.960
Help him die peacefully.

157
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.280
My partner. well…

158
00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.080
she held his hand…

159
00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:37.120
and simply waited for him to die.

160
00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.360
A firetruck arrived and…

161
00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.880
we started asking them to cut the doors

162
00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.720
from the trains
so we could use them as stretchers.

163
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.720
The windows
from nearby houses had shattered

164
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.720
and through those broken windows
people were throwing blankets for us.

165
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.240
A friend of hers called me…

166
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.280
and she only said to me.
"Bomb at Atocha."

167
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.680
I had my mobile here. I grabbed it…

168
00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.400
and I called my mother.

169
00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.800
He said. "Mom. there was an explosion."

170
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.200
And… he said. "Mommy come.
come mommy."

171
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.800
"Dad. dad!

172
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.400
There was an explosion.
and my arm is destroyed."

173
00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.400
And then the call cut off.

174
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.720
So I went…

175
00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.360
to the school to check
if she had arrived and they told me

176
00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.560
she hadn't.

177
00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:34.800
I woke up that morning and thought
I would call him to say "happy birthday".

178
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.320
it's his birthday today
and I should be the first. I'm his mother.

179
00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.320
One of the answers to the calls was…

180
00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.840
"We can't find your sister."

181
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.960
When I called. it went through. but…

182
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.840
no one picked up.

183
00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.560
Since we were undocumented people.

184
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.600
we didn't want the police to come
and start asking us questions.

185
00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.480
I held on to that lady
and was asking her to help me.

186
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.040
I told her I had to leave
that place because…

187
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.400
I didn't want to be deported.

188
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.600
but she said. "How can you leave
if you can't even walk?"

189
00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.320
I had blood all over me.

190
00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.400
I didn't have papers back then

191
00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:15.360
and I was just hoping the police wouldn't
catch me because I had no pa--

192
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.440
I remember… a boy next to me…

193
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.360
He was dead… very young.

194
00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.760
One man came onto the train and saw…

195
00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.520
a finger… that was moving.

196
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.560
He had a wound in his chest.

197
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.440
When I saw the wound.
what I did was put my hand in.

198
00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.440
I put my hand inside him.

199
00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.160
With his hand he…

200
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.040
he lessened the blood loss.

201
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.880
In Spain. we felt

202
00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.240
the permanent threat of local terrorism.

203
00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.360
The terrorism carried out by ETA.

204
00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.080
Two weeks before
some ETA members had been caught.

205
00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.240
They had come to Madrid
with a truck full of explosives

206
00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.600
and they were targeting something big.
but it wasn't known what.

207
00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.240
It's clear.

208
00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.560
ETA has tried to wreck democracy.

209
00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.320
It was a Thursday.

210
00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:11.400
And the general elections
would take place on Sunday.

211
00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:16.160
Thus. there was
a chance this would directly

212
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.040
impact the election.

213
00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.080
Terrorists must know
that any government

214
00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.680
will give them the same answer.

215
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.640
And that it will pursue them

216
00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.560
until they answer
for their atrocious crimes.

217
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.440
This is not the time
to talk about anything

218
00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.280
but the anger we feel
because of this savagery

219
00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:42.000
and the support
for the families of the victims.

220
00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.560
Once the people that need

221
00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.280
medical attention
are removed from the area.

222
00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.600
the areas are secured.

223
00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.680
An inspection of the scene begins.

224
00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:24.200
and all the objects are observed
and then orderly removed.

225
00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:31.200
Suddenly. we can hear people's voices
and screams saying there's another bomb.

226
00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.320
And a personal
and emotional struggle begins.

227
00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.360
The guys from TEDAX told us
we had to leave the place immediately.

228
00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.360
We had to make sure
there were no remaining living victims.

229
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.640
The firefighters didn't know…

230
00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.800
And we all stayed there.

231
00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.400
Because
some people were still alive.

232
00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:06.080
A colleague heard a noise. heard a moan

233
00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.160
and the guy said.
"we need to search here."

234
00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.320
There was a… a girl…

235
00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.480
who was screaming inside.
but what we heard was so low.

236
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.440
And indeed. there was a person

237
00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:22.000
underneath… several people.

238
00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.000
They saw me. they saw that I…

239
00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.120
that I was breathing and…

240
00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.400
I remember that they said.
"This one's alive. she's alive!"

241
00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.400
Our first instinct was to grab her hand.

242
00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:36.080
And when she grabbed my hand. I remember
she held it very very tight. like saying

243
00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.600
"I don't know where I am or what happened.

244
00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.840
but I know this
is what's going to save me."

245
00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.440
In the end.

246
00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.280
two bags
with explosive devices were found.

247
00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.400
One at El Pozo station.

248
00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.920
which had to be neutralized.

249
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.600
The other at Atocha.

250
00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:58.440
and despite TEDAX's
efforts to deactivate it.

251
00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:02.360
they realized that
it wasn't safe enough to do it manually.

252
00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:05.720
so it was neutralized
by allowing it to explode.

253
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.640
The firefighters
had to carry out the hardest job.

254
00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:21.680
We were recovering the bodies.
and in some cases it was really hard.

255
00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.880
I was obsessed with looking
at every spot. at every corner

256
00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.599
so we wouldn't miss anything.

257
00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.599
We looked underneath the rails

258
00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.000
and by tracing the blast wave

259
00:17:31.079 --> 00:17:33.079
I told one firefighter.
"Let's get up on the roof

260
00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.760
in case there's anything there."
Indeed. there was a dead body

261
00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.440
on the roof…

262
00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:48.560
An incident infinitely more painful…

263
00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:53.680
considering how many feelings
we experienced.

264
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.120
The wounds were different.

265
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.960
It wasn't a war. and these
were not soldiers and there were so many.

266
00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.760
I'd never seen a clinical chart
written on an abdomen with a marker.

267
00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.840
The patients arrived
completely out of themselves.

268
00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.240
Most of them were deaf.

269
00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:25.560
I had a burst vertebra.

270
00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.680
I was missing a piece of…
of my forehead and my nose.

271
00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.640
I had tubes coming out of everywhere.

272
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.160
The only thing I was thinking of
was that I had lost my baby.

273
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.680
It felt… impossible. like a nightmare.

274
00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.240
but no. it was real.

275
00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.680
I didn't care that I had burns.
I didn't care that I had broken bones.

276
00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.720
I didn't care that one of my legs
had been amputated.

277
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.400
I didn't care about any of that.
I was alive.

278
00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.920
The blast wave had cut my elbow.

279
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.520
The doctor recommended cutting
his arm off. to amputate his left arm.

280
00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.440
My husband showed me
a picture of my children.

281
00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.080
because I couldn't remember
I had children.

282
00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.080
When I woke up…

283
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.720
My husband.
my parents. my family was there.

284
00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:19.080
I was trying to tell them
how my daughter was dressed.

285
00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:39.040
That same morning
I talked to Baltasar Garzón

286
00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.160
and told him.
"Those ETA people are bastards."

287
00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.840
And Garzón told me.
"Alberto. it wasn't ETA."

288
00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.720
I told Alberto Ruiz Gallardón.
he asked me.

289
00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.360
and I told him it wasn't ETA.

290
00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.880
And I remember he said.
"What are you saying?"

291
00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.320
I said. "No. it wasn't them."

292
00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.880
He told me it wasn't ETA's modus operandi.

293
00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.040
I can tell you at this moment ETA

294
00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:02.960
doesn't have enough operating forces
to carry out an attack this big.

295
00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.040
The abertzale left is not even considering

296
00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.880
as a hypothesis that ETA

297
00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.440
is behind what happened today in Madrid.

298
00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.520
The Government convened a crisis cabinet.

299
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.120
and to our surprise. we discovered

300
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:33.040
that the people who were called
to participate in the crisis cabinet

301
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.680
were people who had little to do

302
00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.560
with any police or security department

303
00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.840
and had more to do with the Popular Party.

304
00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.080
And furthermore. the Director
of the National Intelligence Service

305
00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.120
hadn't been asked to join.

306
00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:49.080
That was the first time I had a feeling

307
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.600
that things were starting
to become delicate

308
00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.240
and might end up becoming dangerous.

309
00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.520
There were two meetings that morning.

310
00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.520
One took place at the Moncloa and was
presided by the president.

311
00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.200
and another one
at the Ministry of Interior.

312
00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.160
which was presided
by the Minister Acebes.

313
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.400
I wasn't invited to either of them.

314
00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.680
There was a meeting
of the police higherups

315
00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:16.960
between 12:00 and 1:00 PM
at the Ministry of Interior.

316
00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.480
One of the police commanders called

317
00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:23.240
the police commander in charge
of the TEDAX. who was working

318
00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:26.800
in one of the attack sites. to ask him
if he knew anything about the explosives.

319
00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.480
And he said it could be dynamite
with a detonating cord.

320
00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.520
that's what Santiago Cuadro Jaén says.

321
00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.800
And Pedro Díaz Pintado
says he heard him say

322
00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.800
it might be Titadine
with a detonating cord.

323
00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:41.400
Both have sworn to death that it was
the other that made the mistake.

324
00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.920
Santiago Cuadro says
he never said Titadine

325
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.800
and Díaz Pintado says he heard Titadine.

326
00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.360
That's what he reported
to the rest of the police commanders

327
00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.800
and what he later reported
to the minister.

328
00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.080
That morning we were told
that what had blown was Titadine.

329
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:57.400
not goma-2 ECO.
which is what actually blew up.

330
00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.120
Titadine was ETA's usual weapon.

331
00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.840
The Titadine issue is a rumor

332
00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:09.600
that started spreading in the first hours
immediately after the attacks

333
00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.880
when we still weren't able
to determine the type of explosive.

334
00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.640
First. because
there was no expert analysis

335
00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.440
and second. because the expert
analysis that was done later

336
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:20.880
could only determine the type of explosive

337
00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.520
used for the explosion. not the brand.

338
00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:24.880
And Titadine is a brand.

339
00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.640
The President of the Government
José María Aznar called

340
00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:36.920
all the main newspapers'
directors to tell them

341
00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:40.160
the government was certain ETA
was behind the attacks.

342
00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:44.080
We received a direct phone call
from the President.

343
00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.040
He told us then that

344
00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:50.560
the most likely hypothesis
they were going with

345
00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.800
was that the terrorist organization ETA
was behind the attack.

346
00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:59.400
The President of the Government considered

347
00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:04.320
ETA directly responsible for the attack
without any doubt whatsoever.

348
00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.760
We had just closed
the edition of the newspaper

349
00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.840
with the front page headline

350
00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.400
"Terrorist Massacre in Madrid."

351
00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.640
And after Aznar's call.

352
00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.280
I changed the headline

353
00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.280
to "ETA Massacre in Madrid."

354
00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:40.000
How could we not trust the word
of the President?

355
00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:47.360
The police. due to the M.O.. discarded ETA

356
00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.760
almost from the beginning.

357
00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.680
I felt pretty uncomfortable…

358
00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:56.240
because an attack of such magnitude

359
00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.520
was something that ETA.
unless it was a faction

360
00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.800
that was trying to split from them.

361
00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:03.200
wasn't interested in.

362
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.440
At this moment. security forces and corps

363
00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:12.440
as well as the Ministry of Interior.
have no doubt

364
00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.800
that the terrorist organization ETA
is behind the attack.

365
00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:22.680
There is no possible nor desirable
negotiation with these murderers

366
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.320
who have so many times
brought death throughout all of Spain.

367
00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.560
Spanish television is providing you
information on the series of attacks

368
00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.200
in Madrid through which
ETA has tried to plant

369
00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.280
the seeds of chaos and panic
at the end of the electoral campaign.

370
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.880
The government called
the United Nations to demand

371
00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.560
a statement condemning the attacks.

372
00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.560
They asked and insisted
that the Security Council

373
00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.320
condemn the attacks.

374
00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.320
The government insisted.

375
00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.400
that as statement of condemnation
was not enough.

376
00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:29.120
it had to say that the attacks
had been perpetrated by ETA.

377
00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:41.520
The Renault Kangoo was found around noon

378
00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:45.520
and people from the Provincial
Information Brigade showed up.

379
00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.880
They said that the Renault didn't match

380
00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:53.640
the information that a vehicle
manipulated by ETA should provide.

381
00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.960
When we found the van.
there were some remaining

382
00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:00.800
explosive devices and it was determine
they were made of goma-2 ECO.

383
00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:05.320
The policemen in charge managed
the information correctly.

384
00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:07.280
but it is obvious that there was

385
00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.000
a discrepancy
between the information provided

386
00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.240
and the information the public had.

387
00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.800
A van was found

388
00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.160
in Alcalá de Henares

389
00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:22.320
and in the front seat we found

390
00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:28.280
seven detonating devices
and also among others tapes.

391
00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.560
we found one in Arabic containing

392
00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:35.400
Quran verses regarding teaching.

393
00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:41.040
This made me instruct

394
00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:47.040
our police forces and corps not to dismiss
any line of investigation.

395
00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.240
I insisted that our main line
of investigation. the one the police

396
00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:53.760
and the national guard was considering
as essential. same as this morning.

397
00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.440
was that of the terrorist group ETA.

398
00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.800
Spain is still in shock of this tragedy

399
00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:15.120
caused by the series
of attacks that happened

400
00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.760
today that.
according to most of the hypotheses.

401
00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.880
ETA carried out in Madrid.

402
00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:26.840
A letter supposedly
from the terrorist organization Al-Qaeda

403
00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.520
was sent to an Arabic newspaper in London

404
00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:33.280
and in it the group claims to be behind

405
00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.080
this morning's attacks in Madrid.

406
00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:48.920
Al-Qaeda justifies the attacks as part

407
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.320
of old unsettled debts
in what they call the Spanish crusade.

408
00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.320
It was very painful to see how the issue

409
00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.840
of the people who died
was slowly fading away.

410
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:55.200
The dead bodies were taken
to pavilion 6 at IFEMA.

411
00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.920
Then the autopsies began.

412
00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.960
There were many families
who didn't know yet

413
00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:04.960
that their relative was dead.

414
00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:06.640
They were holding on to the hope that they

415
00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.880
might find them at the hospital among
the unidentified wounded.

416
00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.960
To everyone that approached and asked me

417
00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:14.440
if I needed something.
I would answer. "Look for my boy."

418
00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:17.600
I believed my son
would show up any minute.

419
00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.200
It was past 11.

420
00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.640
It was past 12.

421
00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.280
All night without knowing anything.

422
00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:28.960
They explained the same thing. as always.
Dad had gone to heaven because…

423
00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.080
some evil people wanted to take him.

424
00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.200
That feeling of not wanting to be called.

425
00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:37.720
Of not wanting

426
00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:40.520
to hear your family's name.
your daughter's name.

427
00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:43.200
We told a family that…

428
00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.640
their relative was dead.

429
00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.960
And we would accompany them

430
00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.560
immediately to identify the body.

431
00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:53.040
It seemed that they had found…

432
00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:54.920
Daniel's body.

433
00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.240
They had to make a DNA test
to identify him properly.

434
00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:01.240
I only remember that I said one phrase.

435
00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.040
Please. even if it's a lie…

436
00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:08.120
swear to me…
that my son died without any suffering.

437
00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:14.560
The police told me
we needed to see a picture.

438
00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.960
And I told them it was my daughter.

439
00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.160
My husband went in

440
00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:25.080
to identify a person.
thinking it was his daughter.

441
00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.600
But he said it wasn't.

442
00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.880
And it was his daughter.

443
00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.360
It's the hardest thing

444
00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:34.760
any father could go through.

445
00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.520
or any mother.

446
00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.640
I was so stubborn about being
one of the persons going in.

447
00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:43.840
And I went in.

448
00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.320
And there she was.

449
00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:52.120
And then…

450
00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:53.920
that was it.

451
00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:51.200
All of us were wondering.
"How can I help?"

452
00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:53.120
All the wounded had someone

453
00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:55.800
next to them holding their hand.

454
00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.320
People from the streets.

455
00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.000
He held my hand
and told me all along.

456
00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.400
"Don't worry.
we're going to help you."

457
00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:05.320
There were people
who were still alive but… no…

458
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.440
They didn't have any chance.

459
00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:11.640
I never imagined someone who wasn't
a health worker could do such thing.

460
00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:18.400
In that moment.
some people did things that…

461
00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.200
that under normal circumstances
they wouldn't do.

462
00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.880
I thought they were going to leave.
but when I said "Let's go look inside".

463
00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:26.200
eight or ten people went in and those
eight or ten stayed until the end.

464
00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:29.600
The lines to donate blood

465
00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.760
had no end.

466
00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:34.840
The taxi driver told me I didn't have
to pay him anything and wished me luck.

467
00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.400
Everyone showed up. Everyone.

468
00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:43.600
"We're not afraid."

469
00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.920
While writing an article…

470
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.120
It was so hard to convey

471
00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.600
the great pain we were seeing.

472
00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.840
Whenever an ambulance
passed through. people would clap.

473
00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:57.240
I really wanted to thank the people

474
00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.160
for helping us and what they did.

475
00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:02.200
We did everything we could
and if I couldn't do better

476
00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.280
I apologize. obviously. Right?

477
00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:07.280
To anyone that at that time

478
00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:10.040
cried for us. know that

479
00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:12.120
I will be eternally grateful to you.

480
00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:23.640
I'd never seen my country
as united like that day. Never.

481
00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:25.440
Two days later.

482
00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:28.120
Spain was divided
like I'd never seen before.

483
00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:32.840
We are committed to fight new threats

484
00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:37.400
like terrorism. weapons of mass
destruction and tyrannical regimes.

485
00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:13.920
The role of Spain
in the Iraq occupation was very polemical.

486
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000
it was very controversial.

487
00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:19.600
and it produced
large protests in the streets.

488
00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:23.280
It brought to the forefront matters
of international politics

489
00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:25.600
for the general public. something
that had never happened before.

490
00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:29.000
The interest of the general public
in foreign affairs

491
00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.720
was very limited.

492
00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:37.960
Instructions were given to pick up
and store bag the evidence found

493
00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.720
and to send it to IFEMA.

494
00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:44.440
The judge in charge stated in the report

495
00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:47.960
that the evidence was going to be held
at the Puente de Vallecas precinct.

496
00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:51.160
we had to go to IFEMA

497
00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:55.000
and bring everything
to the Puente de Vallecas precinct.

498
00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:59.400
While doing an inspection and writing

499
00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:01.640
a report of everything
that was inside the bag.

500
00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:05.240
a police officer found the device.

501
00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:09.280
I got a call and they told me
they had found a bomb

502
00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:11.480
and that they had already called
the TEDAX team.

503
00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.120
that they had evacuated the precinct.

504
00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:17.680
We took it to a park
to be able to deactivate it

505
00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.760
more securely and without putting
other people at risk.

506
00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:22.520
there we could go slowly.

507
00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:25.440
and we were able to deactivate it.

508
00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.560
In the X-ray we could perfectly see

509
00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:30.440
a very long wire
that hadn't been properly fitted.

510
00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.640
It was like this.
which is why it didn't explode.

511
00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:35.960
The backpack contained a phone.

512
00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.360
a card and an explosive device.

513
00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:41.120
With this. the police started working

514
00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:44.680
backwards to figure out where
the explosive devices came from.

515
00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:47.520
where the phone was bought

516
00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.400
and where the card was bought.

517
00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:56.240
Does anyone believe
that any sensible government

518
00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:59.080
in Spain after 30 years

519
00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:02.080
of terrorism and after facing
an attack like yesterday's

520
00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.720
wouldn't logically.

521
00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:07.240
reasonably. believe

522
00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:11.000
that that gang might be behind it?

523
00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:29.040
For some. if it had been ETA.

524
00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:30.920
this would be a victory
for the Popular Party.

525
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.600
however. for others
if the Islamists had done it.

526
00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:36.800
Islamic terrorists. this would give

527
00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:40.840
the south an advantage in the elections
that would take place in three days.

528
00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:47.600
The main line
of investigation is still ETA.

529
00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:50.440
Yes. it's still the main
line of investigation.

530
00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:53.680
this is what I've been told moments ago

531
00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:57.520
by the security forces and corps.
who are in charge of the investigation.

532
00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:30.760
An anonymous call on behalf of ETA

533
00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:33.160
assures that the terrorist organization
was not responsible

534
00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:34.720
and it was published
by the newspaper Gara.

535
00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.560
The White House offered

536
00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:44.560
an interview with the President
and the First Lady

537
00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.280
at ambassador Javier Rupérez's residence.

538
00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:49.400
The offer was a surprise

539
00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:51.240
due to the nature of the interview.

540
00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:54.640
but it was normal
that the White House press called

541
00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:57.120
the Spanish Television correspondents.

542
00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:59.040
I always believed it was

543
00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:02.160
because of the connection. the friendship

544
00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.760
between Bush and Aznar.

545
00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:06.480
It was the first time
an American president

546
00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.000
visited a foreign ambassador
in Washington.

547
00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:19.480
Rumsfeld. Condoleezza Rice were there.

548
00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:22.800
We knew Colin Powell.
who had a very high position

549
00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.600
in Bush's administration. was coming.

550
00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:30.840
Bush did the interview next to his wife

551
00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:32.000
and afterwards

552
00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:35.000
Lorenzo called me to tell me
that Spanish Television

553
00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:37.600
would not broadcast the interview.

554
00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.040
At that time. I supposed.

555
00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:41.120
and I still believe it now.

556
00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:45.680
that Spanish Television's director

557
00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:48.520
believed it wasn't timely

558
00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:50.520
to link…

559
00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.800
what had happened in Madrid
with President Bush

560
00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:56.640
because that led to Iraq.

561
00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.600
And what I understood

562
00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.760
was that Spanish Television's
directors were…

563
00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:04.520
trying to keep going
with the government's version.

564
00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:05.440
which was ETA.

565
00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:17.520
Bush held me back and asked
if we could talk privately.

566
00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:20.080
He asked me. "Who do you think

567
00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.800
is behind this?" And I said.
"Well. we believe it's ETA."

568
00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.400
Then he told me.

569
00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.360
"My intelligence services say

570
00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:28.680
there's a chance it wasn't ETA."

571
00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:30.280
When the President of the United States

572
00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:31.920
says his intelligence services

573
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.840
are finding out
that it was someone else. well…

574
00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.120
I called Aznar to told him and…

575
00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:39.640
Aznar. I imagine Aznar knew

576
00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:42.400
much more than I did
at that moment. right?

577
00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:44.520
He was already aware
of the issue since he…

578
00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:47.840
Let's say the rumor mill

579
00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:50.000
had already started in Madrid.

580
00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:19.480
It began with the usual
shouts of "No to terrorism…"

581
00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:23.240
but then something starts to come out…

582
00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:25.480
a voice in a…

583
00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:30.440
very spontaneous manner
asking who was it.

584
00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:36.120
That question. at that demonstration.

585
00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:39.360
that day. already…

586
00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:42.080
told us that the people didn't believe

587
00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:44.040
the government's version.

588
00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:16.960
It seems like some people

589
00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:19.680
want to dismiss the possibility

590
00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:21.600
that the criminal and murderous
organization ETA is behind this.

591
00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:25.400
As the investigation continues.

592
00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:29.560
there is more evidence
pointing to Arabs. not ETA.

593
00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:31.880
Specially when they find phone numbers

594
00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:35.760
through one of the phone cards
found next to the bombs.

595
00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:37.200
Those numbers were tracked

596
00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:39.280
and it turned out that the phone card

597
00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:44.360
was sold in Lavapies in a store

598
00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:47.200
of an Arab named Jamal Zougam.

599
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.880
Jamal Zougam was a person
with a jihadist background.

600
00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:55.240
He was someone who had already been
flagged by French intelligence services

601
00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:57.000
for his ties to jihadism.

602
00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:03.280
No Spaniard can be surprised
that the priority

603
00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:06.680
is the terrorist organization
that's spent 30 years

604
00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:10.120
attacking Spain.
and that's caused nearly 900 deaths.

605
00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.920
That is the priority.

606
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.960
I haven't heard it's Al-Qaeda from anyone
at the security forces and corps

607
00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:20.680
or that the favor an investigative line

608
00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:23.400
regarding that terrorist organization.

609
00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:37.560
The first detentions
were of citizens from Maghreb.

610
00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:38.960
Where's ETA?

611
00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:43.560
The head of the NIC had been

612
00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:49.000
excluded from both political
and investigative meetings.

613
00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:53.040
and suddenly the government
asks him to make a statement

614
00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:56.040
blaming ETA for the attacks.

615
00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:00.040
when the police already had
by noon on Saturday the information

616
00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:04.000
of the stores where the phones

617
00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:08.200
used in the attacks had been sold.

618
00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:11.760
I met with Minister Acebes in his office

619
00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:14.040
on Saturday at 4:00 PM
and I wasn't told anything.

620
00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:16.920
From Moncloa.
I'm being asked to say something

621
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.840
that is obviously going nowhere.

622
00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.440
and they already know that the ETA trail
has no validity whatsoever

623
00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:23.440
and that the Islamist trail
is the valid one.

624
00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.440
I felt very bad that day.

625
00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:27.960
I felt very manipulated
and that day I wanted…

626
00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:30.920
I wanted to quit.
But imagine. if that night.

627
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.720
the day before the elections.
I had presented my resignation.

628
00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:36.080
I would've directly caused him
to lose the elections.

629
00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:37.800
and that was a burden
I didn't want to carry either.

630
00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.360
Before the ballots open.

631
00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:01.760
the local cell records a video

632
00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:04.080
with the intent of being able to intervene

633
00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:07.000
in the discussion that had already started

634
00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:09.080
in the media and among Spain's society

635
00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:12.200
regarding who was behind the attacks.

636
00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:23.520
The video was made by one
of the terrorists dressed as a woman

637
00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:26.440
because that was what he had nearby.
Imagine how desperate

638
00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:28.480
they were feeling.
the need they had to say.

639
00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.880
"Hey. it was us who killed them. not ETA.

640
00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:32.280
It was us. damn it!"

641
00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:39.360
I think nothing should be dismissed.

642
00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:41.400
The police will continue to work

643
00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:44.280
investigating every possibility.

644
00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:48.120
The Minister of Interior subjected himself

645
00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:52.320
to a dramatic sequence
of public appearances

646
00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:55.400
in which the information he provided

647
00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:58.840
was very volatile.
and at the same time very contradictory.

648
00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:03.000
It was extremely surprising
that someone like Aznar

649
00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:06.080
wasn't capable of stopping that version.

650
00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:08.680
because it was obvious that the opposition

651
00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:12.680
was going to use the ammunition
they were giving them.

652
00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.080
On the day of reflection.

653
00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:25.440
the Spanish left went out to the streets
and criticized the government

654
00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:28.280
harshly and disproportionately.

655
00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:32.280
In Spain.
on the 24 hours before an election.

656
00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:34.680
it is forbidden to make
any political propaganda.

657
00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:38.880
Many of the meetings taking place
in the streets and in front

658
00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:41.960
of the Popular Party headquarters
were organized through social media.

659
00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:43.680
which. on top of that.

660
00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:47.800
were still unknown or. at least.
their use was very rare.

661
00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.520
The complaints started very strong.

662
00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:05.640
There was a demonstration in front
of the Popular Party's headquarters.

663
00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:07.840
berating the government despite the fact

664
00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:11.080
that there had been no evidence
of culpability from the government.

665
00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:17.200
There is an illegal demonstration

666
00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:21.800
that is also blaming the Popular Party
for terrible crimes.

667
00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:25.800
The government was in trouble.
the opposition had seen blood

668
00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:31.360
and the chance to change
the election outcome unexpectedly.

669
00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:52.200
Spanish citizens deserve a government
that doesn't lie to them.

670
00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:55.360
They deserve a government
that always speaks the truth.

671
00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:01.600
The government.
since the beginning has acted

672
00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:04.880
and continues to act
with full transparency.

673
00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:53.280
On Sunday 14th. I went
down to vote with my husband and daughter.

674
00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:56.440
Miriam was going to London on Thursday.

675
00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:59.480
so she sent her vote through mail.
I asked to be present

676
00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:01.840
to make sure Miriam's vote was counted.

677
00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:04.040
I went to vote.

678
00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:08.560
I went because my boy

679
00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:10.720
wanted to vote. but they didn't let him.

680
00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:39.880
The day of the elections gave the victory.
surprisingly. to the opposition party.

681
00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:50.280
I've given orders
to have the Spanish troops

682
00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:52.080
posted in Iraq

683
00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:58.080
come home as soon
and as safely as possible.

684
00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.640
Condoleezza Rice
called me to express

685
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.880
her surprise. her shock.

686
00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:18.800
Because they hadn't warned the Americans.
they hadn't said anything.

687
00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:21.040
There was this sense that Zapatero

688
00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:23.160
is kind of doing
what the terrorists have asked.

689
00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:26.920
He should have waited
long enough so that no one

690
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.320
would think that there was
a cause-and-effect relationship

691
00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:31.040
between the attacks and the withdrawal.

692
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.760
Choosing March 11
as the day of the attacks in Madrid

693
00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:38.360
had nothing to do with the elections.

694
00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:42.480
It was rather a matter of strategy
for the terrorist organization Al-Qaeda.

695
00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:48.080
The first evidence of March 11

696
00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:50.720
having been chosen
as the day to attack Madrid

697
00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:53.640
dates back

698
00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:57.000
to October 19. 2003.

699
00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:59.960
An on October 19. 2003.

700
00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:03.400
the general elections
hadn't been called yet

701
00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:05.280
in Spain.

702
00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:07.400
There's objective data indicating

703
00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:10.640
that the attacks were fully planned
in Belgium. in Brussels.

704
00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:14.320
It's a document to be able
to acquire a mobile telephone chip

705
00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:18.160
that would be used
by the March 11 network.

706
00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:21.280
In those documents.
they put two false dates of birth.

707
00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:24.680
One is replaced by May 16.

708
00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:27.360
the date of the attacks in Casablanca.

709
00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:31.720
and the other one
is replaced by March 11.

710
00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:35.280
the day the attacks in Madrid would occur.

711
00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:38.080
Both pieces of information date back
to before the elections were called.

712
00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:42.600
Therefore. it's hard to believe
that someone was heading

713
00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:45.520
the presidency and knew he would call
for an election on March 14.

714
00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:14.800
With all the data
that the national police had gathered.

715
00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:17.600
we started to draw the first conclusions

716
00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:21.640
on all the devices that hadn't exploded.

717
00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:26.080
Once we found out where the mobile
phones' chips had been bought.

718
00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:28.720
we were able to locate the phones

719
00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:30.720
through the radioelectric network.

720
00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:33.760
And they were near a house
we already knew of

721
00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:37.480
which is where the explosives were made.
in they are of Morata de Tajuña.

722
00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:44.960
That type of explosive came from mines.
especially those located in Asturias.

723
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.520
Conchita Mine is a very rural place.

724
00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:53.280
it was relatively easy to hide
big amounts of explosive materials there.

725
00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:56.120
There were explosive cartridges.

726
00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:59.760
which were not at the munitions dump.
as they should have been.

727
00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:02.920
All the explosive devices.
as well as the rest of the detonators.

728
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.720
and there were many different types.
had all come from the same mine.

729
00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:10.080
The other part of the investigation
was now to identify

730
00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:13.400
all the people who might have had a role

731
00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:17.280
in allowing the terrorists to have
this amount of explosives.

732
00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:20.040
The linking piece was

733
00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:23.480
an individual called Rafa Zouhier.

734
00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:26.000
who knew the perpetrators

735
00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:28.000
and also the people
at the mine in Asturias.

736
00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:31.120
And both groups arranged it.

737
00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:34.840
The jihadist cell
got their explosives in Asturias

738
00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:37.680
by trading them for hashish.
as simple as that.

739
00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:40.240
They took them to Madrid
and planned the attacks.

740
00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:46.320
The operation leader of the cell.

741
00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:50.800
when he was driving from Asturias
with 200 kg of explosives.

742
00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:53.000
was stopped by the Civil Guard.

743
00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:58.040
They were stopped. identified.
and there was nothing against them.

744
00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:02.680
He was fined and he paid in cash.

745
00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:05.200
They didn't search the trunk
where all the explosives were.

746
00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:07.040
The car had duplicated plates.

747
00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:09.000
If instead of a traffic patrol car

748
00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:12.840
an antiterrorist control patrol car
had been there. he'd been arrested.

749
00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:19.880
There were serious coordination failures

750
00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:23.480
between the Civil Guard.
the National Police Corps.

751
00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:25.120
and also of international cooperation.

752
00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:28.120
There were many lines of investigation.

753
00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:30.560
but none of them were concrete.

754
00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:32.560
We knew they had a lot of explosives

755
00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:34.960
and that they would go on killing

756
00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:36.560
while the could.

757
00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:32.760
Some security guards
who were patrolling near the AVE rails saw

758
00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:35.800
a suspicious vehicle.
with two individuals acting suspiciously

759
00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:39.200
and they called the Civil Guard.
The people who were there

760
00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:43.400
noticed the movement
and that they had been found out and left.

761
00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:46.560
They cut some of the wire
to access the rails

762
00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:49.960
and they tried to plant
some explosives there.

763
00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:53.400
12 kilograms of explosives
with their detonators had been placed

764
00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:56.200
under the rail and hidden with rocks.
As the train passed.

765
00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:58.520
they would've simply had
to detonate them manually.

766
00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:01.040
They placed it a few meters
away from a bridge.

767
00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:05.960
Had it exploded. it would've been
a similar carnage to that of March 11th.

768
00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:10.320
Because of the way the explosive
device had been placed.

769
00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:13.360
all the people on the train
would have died.

770
00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:21.720
The General Information Precinct
already had information

771
00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:23.920
about the possible perpetrators

772
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:27.280
of the attacks. and they were all
from a jihadist cell

773
00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:29.840
that was mainly composed
of individuals from Morocco.

774
00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:34.200
At that time the only one
that had been to Afghanistan

775
00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:37.240
and had returned to Spain was Said Berraj.

776
00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:40.400
Said Berraj had to have been the one

777
00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:42.560
to teach them how to make the explosives.

778
00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:46.960
We were investigating mainly

779
00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:50.440
all the phone numbers
that had been in touch

780
00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:54.640
or had had anything to do with the phones
that were used for the bombs.

781
00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:56.080
A point came

782
00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:58.320
when we had a map

783
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:02.040
that looked like a star
with hundreds of points.

784
00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:05.120
here we placed the different phone numbers

785
00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:08.240
owned by people who could
have been involved in the attacks.

786
00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:14.360
One of the numbers really caught my eye

787
00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:18.480
because it looked really similar
to the batch related to Said Berraj.

788
00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:22.840
I decided to investigate the phone number

789
00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:26.560
and we saw that the last incoming call

790
00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:28.080
was from a Spaniard

791
00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:31.000
that had rented an apartment
to some Arabs.

792
00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:33.720
They had given him their foreign number

793
00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:36.680
and the name of Mohamed Belhadj

794
00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:39.200
and… at 3:00 PM…

795
00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:42.880
I called my then boss. my superior…

796
00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:47.080
and told him "I've found the security
apartment of the terrorists."

797
00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:48.920
I asked. "Is there someone inside?"

798
00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:52.480
And Rafa says.
"Yes. there are people inside."

799
00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:01.480
Abdelmajid Bouchar was one
of the people inside the apartment

800
01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:03.160
and he went down to take out the trash.

801
01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:06.360
This person notices
the presence of members

802
01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:08.760
of the Central Unit
of Foreign Intelligence.

803
01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:11.840
The units are dressed as civilians

804
01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:14.800
and then he leaves
the bag in the container.

805
01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:17.560
And he starts running.

806
01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:24.760
The police couldn't stop him
at that time because

807
01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:28.560
what we didn't know was that Abdelmajid
Bouchar was actually an athlete.

808
01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.520
The guys up in the apartment

809
01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.120
started shooting from the windows

810
01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:39.920
and for us that was confirmation

811
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.640
that they were the terrorists.

812
01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:46.440
The amount of explosives
that they may still have

813
01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:48.320
could be high. very high.

814
01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:50.480
It was likely they had it
in the apartment.

815
01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:54.160
One of Morocco's State
security forces called me

816
01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:57.040
since they already had the names
of the people we were looking for

817
01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:59.000
and obviously the phones had been bugged.

818
01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:02.320
They told me that they
had called their families in Morocco

819
01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:03.840
to say goodbye.

820
01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:06.640
He told me they believed
they were going to kill themselves.

821
01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:11.360
The area is sealed off

822
01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:13.960
and all the citizen security units
are mobilized.

823
01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:15.800
and GEO is sent.

824
01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:17.520
the Special Ops Group.

825
01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:22.320
to carry out the assault
or to negotiate the terrorists' surrender.

826
01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:25.760
We proceeded
and went up to the first floor

827
01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:28.200
where the place they were living in was.

828
01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:32.080
We put a controlled
explosive device on the door.

829
01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:36.160
They started shooting from the inside

830
01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:37.960
and we could hear chanting in Arabic.

831
01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:42.440
The chief of the operation
ordered us to throw tear gas inside.

832
01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:44.480
and a short while later we saw Javier.

833
01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:47.320
who was the only one that could see inside
through the shield window.

834
01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:49.680
signaled he could see someone

835
01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:52.400
and he was talking to someone inside.
and he told him.

836
01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:55.080
"Get out slowly. undress. undress."

837
01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.320
The blast wave threw me into the air.

838
01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:11.480
my eardrums were gone.
I could barely hear.

839
01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:13.960
When the explosion's movement stopped

840
01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:18.160
and I saw I was fine. I looked up
at the building. the assault was over.

841
01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:21.080
everything was about. well. to collapse.

842
01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:24.240
Then we all got to work

843
01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:27.720
to rescue our teammates
who had been buried under the rubble.

844
01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:29.400
We also took Javier out.

845
01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:32.120
who was very injured at that moment.

846
01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:38.680
An object cut his leg
and he didn't make it.

847
01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:54.200
We found the remains of seven bodies.

848
01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:56.080
completely destroyed.

849
01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:59.800
The leaders of the cell
killed themselves there.

850
01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:08.520
They were the ones
who put the backpacks in the train

851
01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:10.160
getting on at Alcalá de Henares.

852
01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:13.720
They got on different trains.
left the backpacks and got off

853
01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:15.280
at intermediate stations.

854
01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:25.920
The terrorists had started
but hadn't finished

855
01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:28.880
a series of attacks they had planned.

856
01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:31.160
They had a house

857
01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:33.440
they had rented very close to Granada.

858
01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:35.680
One of them left a will.

859
01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:38.080
They were counting on the fact

860
01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:41.680
if they weren't detained.
their goal was to…

861
01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:45.720
their ultimate goal was to become
what they understand as…

862
01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:47.160
a martyr.

863
01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:56.880
The grave of GEO member Torronteras.

864
01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:58.960
who died during the explosion.
was desecrated.

865
01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:01.640
The coffin was pulled out.
the body was taken out and…

866
01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:02.840
and burnt.

867
01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:24.840
The ones who planned that out…

868
01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:27.680
The ones I asked before…

869
01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.240
when. who. and why…

870
01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:35.200
They decided that day.
precisely that day…

871
01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:39.320
Well. I don't think they are
in far away deserts.

872
01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:42.960
Or that they're in far away mountains.

873
01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:50.480
What do you mean by that?

874
01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:52.480
Your honor. I'm saying what I said.

875
01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:54.440
and if you want to know.

876
01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:55.840
investigate it. your honor.

877
01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:57.960
Don't ask me
to take responsibility on that.

878
01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:01.320
I didn't have much information because
we weren't part of the investigation.

879
01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:04.080
There were no meetings
in which we participated

880
01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:08.240
and in which investigation tasks
were assigned or distributed to us.

881
01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:09.640
That's after the 16th.

882
01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.800
It doesn't make sense
that some common criminals

883
01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:15.720
were able to plan and carry out

884
01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:18.920
the largest terrorist attack
in the history of Europe.

885
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.680
and which even toppled a government.

886
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000
You…

887
01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:26.800
insist time and again
in pulling an esoteric link

888
01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:29.080
between ETA and Al-Qaeda
not because you care about the truth.

889
01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:32.080
because you care that the people--

890
01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:34.200
what you care about is that the people
keep thinking that there is a link.

891
01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:36.000
because that. somehow.

892
01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.840
will allow you to keep defending the lies
you told between the 11th and the 14th.

893
01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:42.560
You are the ones who cannot
live with the circumstances

894
01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:43.760
in which you won.

895
01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:47.840
You don't care about what's
on the reports. or the judicial process.

896
01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:49.640
or the data. you don't care about that.

897
01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:53.720
You have the irresistible need.

898
01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:57.120
irresistible. to say the investigation
is not being carried out.

899
01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:01.240
Today instead of the president
showing up. an agitator has shown up.

900
01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:10.600
What were you laughing about.
your honors?

901
01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:14.040
What we're talking about. your honors…

902
01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:17.040
is of the death and permanent injuries

903
01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:18.880
suffered by human beings.

904
01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:23.200
Of losses that have filled us
with grief and bitterness.

905
01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:25.920
What happened? What madness took over

906
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.560
this country in that moment?
Politics cannot steep that low. It can't.

907
01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:33.440
The 11M commission was only there

908
01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:36.080
so that politicians
could throw insults at each other

909
01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:38.880
at the expense of the victims of the 11M.
It didn't serve any purpose.

910
01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:02.600
Everything fell apart.

911
01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:06.320
Why? Because there was a change.
and a new government came in.

912
01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:07.800
That's the answer.

913
01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:15.680
There was a smearing campaign
against the investigative judge.

914
01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:17.760
against the prosecutor.

915
01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:20.040
They wanted. at any cost.

916
01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:23.120
the perpetrators
to be the terrorist organization ETA.

917
01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:30.000
A conspiracy theory was created.

918
01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:35.120
Pedro J. Ramírez.
from the newspaper El Mundo

919
01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:37.320
along with Federico Jiménez Losantos.

920
01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:39.640
who at that time worked at the COPE.

921
01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:40.960
starts spreading stories

922
01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:43.760
to hoist a flag

923
01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:45.960
saying that it wasn't clear
who the perpetrators were.

924
01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:50.560
We ended up turning coincidences

925
01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:54.840
into evidence and putting them
on the front page

926
01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:56.520
with a great reach.

927
01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:02.320
Several theories start circulating
and they always include

928
01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:04.920
a link with ETA.

929
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000
with the Spanish secret service

930
01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:10.520
working for the socialist party…

931
01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:14.440
The conservation of the trains

932
01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:16.200
has also been the target of many theories.

933
01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:19.040
The contention point here
is to understand either that the trains

934
01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:21.720
are the scene of a crime
or that they are evidence for convictions.

935
01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:23.680
The trains are a crime scene that.

936
01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:26.240
after the police has inspected it

937
01:08:26.319 --> 01:08:28.240
and has gathered samples and evidence.

938
01:08:28.319 --> 01:08:30.600
goes back to normal.

939
01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:37.840
They talked a lot about links
between ETA members

940
01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:41.240
that had gone to Morocco.
Where did they find this information?

941
01:08:41.319 --> 01:08:43.200
Morocco never provided
that information to us.

942
01:08:43.279 --> 01:08:45.720
The intelligence services didn't either.

943
01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:08.800
We are in a commercial war.
El Mundo has to leave

944
01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:11.920
its right-wing newspaper competition.
Diario ABC. on the curbside.

945
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.680
Each time El Mundo
published a story like this.

946
01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:17.200
with the support of the COPE.

947
01:09:17.439 --> 01:09:19.640
the sales of El Mundo would go up.

948
01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:21.319
and the sales of ABC would go down.

949
01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:27.800
The efforts to mislead the discussion
of who was behind the 11M

950
01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:32.800
is the most transcendental
and dirtiest journalistic deceit operation

951
01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:36.000
in the history of Spanish journalism
since the transition to democracy.

952
01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:40.439
There isn't even a reasonable margin.

953
01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:42.600
not even to cast doubt…

954
01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:46.680
that some people keep casting
with a good intention

955
01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:51.000
that there was possible
cooperation between ETA and jihadists.

956
01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:55.000
That cooperation has never existed.

957
01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:57.960
There is absolutely no evidence
pointing to any kind of cooperation.

958
01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:00.000
Neither direct nor indirect.

959
01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:04.680
Every attempt at linking the attacks

960
01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:08.640
with the terrorist organization
ETA was absolutely fraudulent.

961
01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:09.800
There was nothing.

962
01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:13.480
Since the beginning. everything pointed
to a jihadist cell.

963
01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:31.400
A damage was done.

964
01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:35.200
unnecessary. gratuitous. and unfair.

965
01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:37.960
to the people who were
just doing their job.

966
01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:47.560
Some journalists.

967
01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:50.200
including Jiménez Losantos.
accused me directly

968
01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:54.640
of being responsible
for a police scheme…

969
01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:59.320
that had planned the attacks.

970
01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:02.320
That I had been an accomplice
of a criminal massacre

971
01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:06.000
and had filled the 11M report
with false evidence.

972
01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:09.840
My wife. my children…

973
01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:13.080
tried to act normal around me. but…

974
01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:16.240
They were carrying
their suffering deep inside

975
01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:18.680
and. in fact. unfortunately. well…

976
01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:22.400
The consequences were lethal.

977
01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:48.640
To understand what happened
on March 11th. 2004 in Madrid.

978
01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:51.120
we have to go back ten years…

979
01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:53.200
to 1994.

980
01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:57.080
That was the year when an Al-Qaeda cell

981
01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:59.560
was formed in Spain.

982
01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:06.760
The Al-Qaeda cell in Spain was formed
by people who had military experience

983
01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:09.760
with the Muslim Brotherhood
that had fled Syria.

984
01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:13.480
They left an influential leader
in their place.

985
01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:15.200
and it was Abu Dahdah.

986
01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:20.160
A real cell begins to form
around Abu Dahdah.

987
01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:21.760
They get married to Spanish women

988
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.920
so they can get the citizenship quickly
and their only way of life

989
01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.600
is to prepare for the jihad.

990
01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:31.200
This cell carried out

991
01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:35.040
financing. radicalization. and recruiting.

992
01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:49.360
Abu Dahdah travelled

993
01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:52.920
at least 10 or 12 times
a year with the money

994
01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.680
they had collected in mosques in Madrid

995
01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:58.800
to give it directly to Abu Qutada
in London.

996
01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:16.480
Two months before September 11.

997
01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:20.000
someone. possibly from Afghanistan.

998
01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:23.920
told Abu Dahdah
that they had entered the aviation field.

999
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.160
The call was in Arabic.
so we asked the translator.

1000
01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:29.800
"What do they mean by aviation field?

1001
01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:32.600
Do they mean they're in an airfield?"

1002
01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:34.760
But the translator would say.

1003
01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:39.400
"No. it means that they have started
to work in the field of aviation."

1004
01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:33.640
The Hamburg cell. led by Mohamed Atta.

1005
01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:37.960
had been in touch
with the Spanish Al-Qaeda cell

1006
01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:40.360
led by Abu Dahdah.

1007
01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:43.440
We went to see a judge.
we said. "We believe

1008
01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:48.240
that the cell has somehow participated
or knew about it beforehand.

1009
01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:50.680
And… I think we should stop them."

1010
01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:58.200
The Dátil operation

1011
01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:02.360
that dismantled the Spanish Al-Qaeda
cell was the most important operation

1012
01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:05.640
against Al-Qaeda carried out
in Western Europe

1013
01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:07.000
since the 9/11 attacks.

1014
01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:12.320
Most of Abu Dahdah's
cell members are detained.

1015
01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:13.760
including their leader.

1016
01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:17.080
However. not all the members
of the cell are detained.

1017
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.200
Amer Azizi. originally from Morocco

1018
01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:23.520
and a resident from Madrid.

1019
01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:28.520
was Abu Dahdah's right hand man
in the Spanish Al-Qaeda cell.

1020
01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:33.440
He was going to be detained that day
when Operation Dátil happened.

1021
01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:35.640
But what we didn't know
is that he wasn't there.

1022
01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:38.400
Later on. we found out
he had left to Afghanistan.

1023
01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:47.120
He decided to plot revenge against Spain

1024
01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:50.600
because of the operation
that had dismantled

1025
01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.560
Abu Dahdah's cell

1026
01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.240
that he had belonged to
until November 2001.

1027
01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:02.440
Amer Azizi. from Pakistan. started

1028
01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:06.600
to give orders so that the remaining
members of Abu Dahdah's cell

1029
01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:11.440
that hadn't been detained
would start to meet and create a new cell.

1030
01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:21.800
Amer Azizi takes that decision
in December 2001

1031
01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:25.120
accompanied by a well-known operative

1032
01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:28.280
of the Islamic group fighting in Libya.

1033
01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:47.360
Throughout this process…

1034
01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:50.680
of planification… Amer Azizi

1035
01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:53.520
becomes part of central Al-Qaeda.

1036
01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:55.760
He begins to climb the ranks

1037
01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:59.440
inside the Al-Qaeda organization.

1038
01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:03.240
He's appointed by Osama Bin Laden himself

1039
01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:06.360
as Al-Qaeda's external operations
deputy chief.

1040
01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:21.040
Amer Azizi manages

1041
01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:24.960
to have his plans to carry out
a terrorist attack in Spain

1042
01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:30.560
approved by Al-Qaeda's leaders themselves

1043
01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:33.720
through their external operations command.

1044
01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:18.080
In the 11M terrorist network.
there are three main components.

1045
01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:21.840
First. what was left of Abu Dahdah's cell.

1046
01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:26.640
The second component is provided
by the Islamic fighting group from Morocco

1047
01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:30.280
through their Western Europe network.

1048
01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:33.520
And the third component

1049
01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:37.200
is formed by the common criminals
turned jihadists

1050
01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:41.200
that joined in the summer of 2003.

1051
01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:44.640
Thus it would be a great mistake

1052
01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:47.280
to reduce the March 11 network

1053
01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:50.520
to a small group of criminals
radicalized by the Iraq War.

1054
01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:09.640
The trial lasted over six months.
it had over 600 witnesses.

1055
01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:12.440
over 90 expert witnesses. 52 lawyers.

1056
01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:15.640
It was a sentence
that was studying in depth

1057
01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:18.600
every allegation of each of the parties.

1058
01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:21.320
The defendants were not all accused
of the same thing.

1059
01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:25.480
We had a main group that was being accused
of having strictly committed the attacks.

1060
01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:29.400
Others were accused
of belonging to one of the cells.

1061
01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:33.160
Others were accused of collaborating.
others of falsifying documents.

1062
01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:35.520
and others
of having provided the explosives.

1063
01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:38.560
In the end. it ended up being
a technically complicated trial.

1064
01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:15.160
The big question was
who was the mastermind

1065
01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:18.880
and why were the attacks
in Madrid planned?

1066
01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:20.320
What was the reason?

1067
01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.600
At the trial.
they weren't able to determine

1068
01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:31.760
why there wasn't a clear mastermind

1069
01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:33.200
behind the attacks on March 11.

1070
01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:46.600
We had a warrant for his search and arrest

1071
01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:48.960
regarding his ties to the Madrid cell.

1072
01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:52.400
We weren't able to figure out
where he was.

1073
01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:54.320
Of course we couldn't locate him.

1074
01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:57.840
and thus we weren't able
to prosecute him at that time.

1075
01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:52.720
We got information
that an American drone had struck

1076
01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:56.760
a meeting attended
by high-ranking leaders of Al-Qaeda

1077
01:22:56.840 --> 01:23:00.280
and that when they checked the rubble.

1078
01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:02.440
they found Amer Azizi.

1079
01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:08.800
When Amer Azizi died.

1080
01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:11.640
the missing piece to figure out

1081
01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:17.040
how the 2004 attacks
in Madrid were planned

1082
01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:21.040
was given by a document
from US authorities.

1083
01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:25.920
where they detailed how Azizi had died
and whom he was with.

1084
01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:33.280
This information was provided
by the United Sates intelligence services

1085
01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:35.840
to Spanish authorities

1086
01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:38.880
in September 2006.

1087
01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:45.480
And again. a more detailed briefing
on Amer Azizi

1088
01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:48.800
and his role in jihadist activities

1089
01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:51.040
in Spain on March 11th

1090
01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:53.400
was again provided in September 2007.

1091
01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:21.520
Azizi's relevance was not understood

1092
01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:25.600
until he was killed.
along with his boss Hamza Rabia.

1093
01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:29.400
discrediting the theory that the 11M cell

1094
01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:32.320
was composed of radicals inspired

1095
01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:35.200
by the words of Osama Bin Laden

1096
01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:38.120
that wanted to contribute to his fight
without having any connection to him.

1097
01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:43.040
If this had been known
at the time the trial took place.

1098
01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:46.840
the final conclusion
would have been different.

1099
01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:49.520
Azizi is the key piece of the puzzle

1100
01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:53.120
that allows us to understand
everything that has happened

1101
01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:56.080
and understand the reason
and meaning of the attacks.

1102
01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:14.280
The government
didn't have enough empathy

1103
01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:18.920
for the shock Spain's society
was going through.

1104
01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:22.720
If I had been the president
of the government at that time.

1105
01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:26.480
the first thing I would've done
is go to Atocha.

1106
01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:30.680
If Aznar had summoned

1107
01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:33.840
the leaders
of each political party to Moncloa…

1108
01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:37.640
Maybe in an act
of condemnation and solidarity…

1109
01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:40.360
Spain is being attacked.

1110
01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:41.800
We are all together.

1111
01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:44.600
and we're going to face this together.

1112
01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:47.160
Whomever the perpetrator is.

1113
01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:51.520
they're not confronting the government.
They're confronting the country

1114
01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:54.320
and all its political forces.

1115
01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:56.840
This picture didn't come about.

1116
01:25:57.960 --> 01:25:59.840
We would've all understood.

1117
01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:02.000
and we wouldn't feel like

1118
01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:05.560
we were deceived.

1119
01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:12.840
If at that time the president had asked
all the citizens to remain calm

1120
01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:15.480
that democracy shall remain victorious.

1121
01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:18.200
and that in two days there's an electoral
date. and that they can vote as they like

1122
01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:22.000
as long as everyone goes to vote.
he would've crushingly won the election.

1123
01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:55.520
It's a sad date. it's a date that
had a very negative impact

1124
01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:58.280
on the political
and social evolution of Spain. no doubt.

1125
01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:01.520
When we talk about 11M…

1126
01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:04.480
we almost forget
that we're talking about the dead.

1127
01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:24.600
The victims have shown me
the best part of human beings.

1128
01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:27.680
Gratefulness.

1129
01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:39.680
Respect and understanding.

1130
01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:52.720
It's something that you learn
to live with. But you never forget.

1131
01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:54.760
When someone dies.

1132
01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:58.960
they keep on living in other
people's memories. but it's very hard.

1133
01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:00.960
We really miss them.

1134
01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:05.280
I don't want to…

1135
01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:08.920
revictimize myself. I am a survivor
and that's how I see myself.

1136
01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:13.320
I'd like to believe something like this
won't ever happen again.

1137
01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:16.320
but of course
what we must not do is forget.
