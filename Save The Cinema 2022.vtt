3
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.000
Don't you just love
these long rainy afternoons

4
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.480
Don't you just love
these long rainy afternoons

5
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.760
in New Orleans
when an hour isn't just an hour

6
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.000
but a little piece of eternity
dropped into your hands

7
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.200
but a little piece of eternity
dropped into your hands

8
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.880
and who knows what to do with it?

9
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.000
You. er. didn't get wet in the rain?

10
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.800
You. er. didn't get wet in the rain?

11
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.560
Perhaps you stepped
inside the drugstore.

12
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.480
I just don't think
it's the kind of thing

13
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.720
our children should be exposed to.

14
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.000
As teachers we should protect
our children from many things.

15
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.960
Great art isn't one of them.
Now sit down.

16
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
You're embarrassing
your daughter. Come on.

17
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.320
You're embarrassing
your daughter. Come on.

18
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.640
Stella! Stella!

19
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.160
She ain't coming down. So you quit.

20
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.000
Stella!
I've been on to you from the start.

21
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.400
Stella!
I've been on to you from the start.

22
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.400
Not once did you pull
any wool over this boy's eyes.

23
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.000
You come in here and sprinkle
the place with powder...

24
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.600
You come in here and sprinkle
the place with powder...

25
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.880
What you are talking
about is brutal desire.

26
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.000
Just Desire. The name of
that rattle-trap streetcar

27
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.040
Just Desire. The name of
that rattle-trap streetcar

28
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.080
that bangs through the Quarter.

29
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.760
up one old narrow
street and down another.

30
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.080
We've seen quite enough.
Oh!

31
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.000
How is it for you.
Mrs Griffiths. huh.

32
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.680
How is it for you.
Mrs Griffiths. huh.

33
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.960
living in blissful ignorance?

34
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.600
Is it better or worse
than quiet desperation?

35
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.000
I don't want realism. I want magic.
Goodnight. mother.

36
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.040
I don't want realism. I want magic.
Goodnight. mother.

37
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.600
Yes. magic.
I try to give that to people.

38
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.640
Whoever you are.

39
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.000
I have always depended
on the kindness of strangers.

40
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.920
I have always depended
on the kindness of strangers.

41
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.360
What was that for?

42
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.160
I'm really nervous.

43
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.000
Focus.

44
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.200
Focus.

45
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.240
Breathe.

46
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.200
Mean what you say.

47
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.160
Have you had enough now?
Come on then.

48
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.000
The sets are looking lovely. David.

49
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.080
Oh. thank you. Mrs Jones.
We're proud of those.

50
00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.000
And when you finally get around
to building my extension.

51
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.480
And when you finally get around
to building my extension.

52
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.920
I expect the same high standards.
Well. I'm not going to make

53
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.560
any promises but. for you.
I'll try my very best. all right?

54
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.000
You must be so busy. Mayor Jenkins.
Ohhh!

55
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.120
You must be so busy. Mayor Jenkins.
Ohhh!

56
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.040
It's fantastic.
Fair play to you to take the time

57
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.440
to come and encourage the children.

58
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.000
Wasn't she the best thing in it?
Oh. definitely.

59
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.600
Wasn't she the best thing in it?
Oh. definitely.

60
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.600
You look dead on your feet. I am.
Mam. Oppressing people is hard work.

61
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.000
We'll head home shortly.
Mm! Mm!-mm!

62
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.760
We'll head home shortly.
Mm! Mm!-mm!

63
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.200
Can we go home soon? Yes. I said
we will. OK. We'll go home shortly.

64
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.680
Mr Morgan.
I'll see you again. Bye-bye now.

65
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.880
Mr Morgan. did you enjoy the show?

66
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.000
Oh. very much. yes. Who was the boy
who played Caiaphas the high priest?

67
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.960
Oh. very much. yes. Who was the boy
who played Caiaphas the high priest?

68
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.080
Oh. that's Nick.
He was a real handful

69
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.000
when he first came to the club.
He's had a real tough time of it.

70
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.320
when he first came to the club.
He's had a real tough time of it.

71
00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.680
You know. his dad.
he was in jail for burglary.

72
00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.600
Yeah.
And his mum likes her drink.

73
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.840
But he never missed a rehearsal.

74
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:04.000
I'm sure you'd have liked something
a bit grittier than Lloyd Webber.

75
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.560
I'm sure you'd have liked something
a bit grittier than Lloyd Webber.

76
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.680
I don't want realism. I want magic.

77
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.000
Hm? I remember that line
from Streetcar. Yeah.

78
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.440
Hm? I remember that line
from Streetcar. Yeah.

79
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.240
I remember you putting
Vivien Leigh to shame. Stop it.

80
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.000
Well...
You come for dinner one night.

81
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.280
Well...
You come for dinner one night.

82
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.240
I'd like that. Would you? Do you
know. I was watching the faces

83
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.480
of the children when
they were performing.

84
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.360
They were transported.

85
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.000
Huh? They believe in magic.
It was fabulous. wasn't it?

86
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.800
Huh? They believe in magic.
It was fabulous. wasn't it?

87
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.240
Oh. here's David now.
Hiya. Mr Morgan. Are you all right?

88
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.560
Yeah. grand.
I was just telling your wife.

89
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.000
- she should be very proud of herself.
- Yeah.

90
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.280
- she should be very proud of herself.
- Yeah.

91
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.680
Anyway. I'll be off. See you both
soon. all right? Nos da. Nos da.

92
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.000
I'll push off. I've got to be at
work in four hours. I know but...

93
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.480
I'll push off. I've got to be at
work in four hours. I know but...

94
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.280
Mark!

95
00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.280
Oh! Hi. Mr Morgan.
That was wonderful. wasn't it. eh?

96
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.000
Oh. thank you. Did you enjoy it?
Oi! I enjoyed every... Jesus!

97
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.400
Oh. thank you. Did you enjoy it?
Oi! I enjoyed every... Jesus!

98
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.320
Oh! Your mam's calling you. All
right. Good to see you. Mr Morgan.

99
00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.360
Peace be with you.

100
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.480
You can drop the
Stanislavski method now. Mm-hm!

101
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.440
What are you drinking. Mam?
Can I have one?

102
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.480
Nom you bloody well can't.
it's mine!

103
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.000
I'm not being funny but you
nearly gave Lil a coronary.

104
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.040
I'm not being funny but you
nearly gave Lil a coronary.

105
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.720
What?
Well. in the interval.

106
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.000
she saw Jesus with his tongue
down Mary Magdalene's throat

107
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:16.920
she saw Jesus with his tongue
down Mary Magdalene's throat

108
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.960
outside the Co-op. I doubt
she'll ever recover from that one.

109
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.240
I wasn't... I wasn't.
It wasn't. Mam. Who was it then?

110
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.400
It was Gwyneth Jones.

111
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.240
Oh. That's all right then.

112
00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.000
But not in the Jesus costume. eh?

113
00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.560
All right. Mam.
I'll see you at home.

114
00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.040
Ta-ra!

115
00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.480
Do you know. I thought the kids
were brilliant last night.

116
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.000
Oh. I know. So. what
are you going to put on next?

117
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:56.880
Oh. I know. So. what
are you going to put on next?

118
00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.480
Give me a break.
I'm still knackered from this one.

119
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.840
But I have been thinking.
you know. about challenging them

120
00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.000
just a little bit more.

121
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.320
just a little bit more.

122
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.240
Midsummer Night's Dream.

123
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.280
Mm! Not that one. Way too scary.

124
00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.000
It's not scary.
It is when you watch it on acid.

125
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.640
It's not scary.
It is when you watch it on acid.

126
00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.480
Found that out on a school trip.

127
00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:20.000
I thought it would be fun. instead
it scared the life out of me.

128
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
I thought it would be fun. instead
it scared the life out of me.

129
00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.760
Since that day. I've never
watched Shakespeare again.

130
00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.760
Wouldn't it make more sense
to never do acid again?

131
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.000
No. Oh!

132
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.480
No. Oh!

133
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:36.000
Carol. Just give it a trim. Nothing
fancy. I'll be back in an hour.

134
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.520
Carol. Just give it a trim. Nothing
fancy. I'll be back in an hour.

135
00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:42.200
But... Take a seat. love. Don't
need to be scared. Go for it.

136
00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:58.640
So. what do you really want?

137
00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.040
You!

138
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.000
Morning. Susan.

139
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.640
Morning. Susan.

140
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.680
Good morning. Mayor.

141
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.720
Can I get a coffee. please?

142
00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.000
Hiya. That'll be £5.
please. Mrs Pritchard.

143
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.720
Hiya. That'll be £5.
please. Mrs Pritchard.

144
00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.320
Cup of tea or coffee?

145
00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.000
I'm fine. thank you.

146
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.360
I'm fine. thank you.

147
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.600
Susan Leonard?

148
00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.000
We were at school together.
I was in the year below you.

149
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:00.440
We were at school together.
I was in the year below you.

150
00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.440
I remember you were one
of the really clever ones.

151
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.280
Didn't you go to Oxford?

152
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.960
Cambridge. actually.

153
00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.200
I was completely useless at school.
Bottom of every class.

154
00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.000
It wasn't until I was 17. they
realised I was hopelessly dyslexic.

155
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:16.200
It wasn't until I was 17. they
realised I was hopelessly dyslexic.

156
00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.480
So. you decided to become a postman?

157
00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.000
Odd choice I know.

158
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:24.520
Odd choice I know.

159
00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.680
People still wonder how
Mrs Williams found out her husband

160
00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.720
was having an affair
with the next door neighbour.

161
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.000
No.

162
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:32.680
No.

163
00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.320
Didn't you get engaged
to David Llewellyn?

164
00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.360
I did. yes.

165
00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.000
I remember thinking he was a lovely
boy. Yeah. I thought so too.

166
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.160
I remember thinking he was a lovely
boy. Yeah. I thought so too.

167
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.480
Until I caught him shagging
my best friend from uni.

168
00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:47.080
Ready now.
Coming.

169
00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:00.600
Richard Goodridge.
Oh. Richard Goodridge!

170
00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.240
Hello. Mayor. Hey! Good to
have you with us. Thank you.

171
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.000
I knew your father. of course.
I remember him telling me

172
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.600
I knew your father. of course.
I remember him telling me

173
00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.920
you were studying Welsh history.
That's right. yes.

174
00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:11.560
For the last seven years now at the
Open University. This just came in.

175
00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.000
My plan is to become a teacher.

176
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.600
My plan is to become a teacher.

177
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:19.400
I almost had my qualification.
then. you know.

178
00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.000
my father had his heart attack.

179
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.720
my father had his heart attack.

180
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:26.720
Oh! Oh. yeah. It was
a terrible shock to all of us.

181
00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.000
Thank you.

182
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:28.760
Thank you.

183
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.800
He loved this town.

184
00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.280
Before he died.
he made me promise that

185
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.000
I would finish off
his hard work he started

186
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:36.360
I would finish off
his hard work he started

187
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.880
setting up
an adult education centre.

188
00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:42.240
Oh! Emlyn had been
banging on about that for years.

189
00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.000
Said that in this changing world
people need the chance

190
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:44.480
Said that in this changing world
people need the chance

191
00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.960
to retrain for new careers.
Absolutely. yeah.

192
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.400
I have a couple...
Richard. Richard. Richard.

193
00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.000
Are you listening. son?

194
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:52.440
Are you listening. son?

195
00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.640
The trick to getting things done
around here is to build alliances.

196
00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:06.080
Huh? Do you have any plans
for Saturday afternoon?

197
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.960
Er. no plans. no.

198
00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.440
We're having a few people over
for drinks at the golf club.

199
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.160
Very informal. Right. But all
the councillors will be there

200
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.680
and you'll be able to
start to get them onside.

201
00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.000
Oh. lovely. Thank you.
I look forward to it.

202
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.720
Oh. lovely. Thank you.
I look forward to it.

203
00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.360
Ahh! Martyn. sorry to keep you.
Yeah. how are you?

204
00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.000
Eh? I just walked in.

205
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:24.400
Eh? I just walked in.

206
00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:27.640
Hey! Hey! Thanks for the gift.
Oh!

207
00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:32.000
Now. this is where I want to
build the new shopping centre.

208
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:32.920
Now. this is where I want to
build the new shopping centre.

209
00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.960
Right.

210
00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.960
Next to the Lyric.
No.

211
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
On the site of the Lyric.
after we demolish it.

212
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.320
On the site of the Lyric.
after we demolish it.

213
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.400
Er...

214
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.400
..but the place is still
being used as a cinema.

215
00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.000
Yeah. showing films
nobody wants to see.

216
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.520
Yeah. showing films
nobody wants to see.

217
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.560
When was the last time you were
there? I saw the Youth Opera

218
00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.000
there last night with my daughter.

219
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.880
there last night with my daughter.

220
00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.000
But their shows
are only every few months.

221
00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.920
You're right. I haven't
seen a film there in ages.

222
00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.000
Precisely.
They'll be bankrupt in a year.

223
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.440
Precisely.
They'll be bankrupt in a year.

224
00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.240
Ha! And you will be stuck
with a ruin in the middle of town

225
00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.000
instead of a vibrant
commercial centre

226
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:12.280
instead of a vibrant
commercial centre

227
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:16.480
that will turn Carmarthen
into a destination location.

228
00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.000
And what's good for
Carmarthen is good for you.

229
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.440
And what's good for
Carmarthen is good for you.

230
00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:27.960
If we can do this. your share
options will go through the roof.

231
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.520
Hm!
You'll be able to retire early

232
00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.600
and live like a king.

233
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.000
Yeah.

234
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:36.200
Yeah.

235
00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.360
You do know it's a listed building.

236
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.000
Well. you can fix that

237
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:44.600
Well. you can fix that

238
00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.640
for a fee.

239
00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.880
Yeah. Yeah.

240
00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:52.000
The place is falling apart.

241
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.920
The place is falling apart.

242
00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:57.160
It might even be
a danger to anyone inside.

243
00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.000
You're right. Ah. it's had its day.

244
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.160
You're right. Ah. it's had its day.

245
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.560
Yeah.

246
00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:08.000
So. you'll sort out the zoning
and planning permissions. hmm?

247
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:08.480
So. you'll sort out the zoning
and planning permissions. hmm?

248
00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.040
Yeah.
I'll get out my chequebook.

249
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.720
Yeah. Yeah.

250
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:37.080
Morning. Dolly. I have to ask you
to keep your voice down. Liz.

251
00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.400
I'm hanging.

252
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.000
Go and have a kip. You'll be fine.

253
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.320
Go and have a kip. You'll be fine.

254
00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.360
You're a life saver. Thank you.

255
00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.000
Susan. Oh!

256
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.360
Susan. Oh!

257
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.440
It's been forever.
Oh. I know. I'm sorry.

258
00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.000
I'm in a bit of a rush. Could
you just do a quick trim? Yeah.

259
00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.000
Thank you. Your mam was
in last week. She's worried

260
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.760
Thank you. Your mam was
in last week. She's worried

261
00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.800
you're going to move
to the other side of the world.

262
00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.640
I applied for a job in Cardiff.

263
00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.000
It's an hour away.
And I doubt I'll even get it.

264
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:04.360
It's an hour away.
And I doubt I'll even get it.

265
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.640
You know. I've always
wanted a career in politics.

266
00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.800
I thought being the mayor's
"executive assistant"

267
00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:12.000
would be a good first step. Turns
out our mayor thinks a woman.

268
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.440
would be a good first step. Turns
out our mayor thinks a woman.

269
00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.560
even one with a law degree.
is only capable

270
00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.600
of filing and answering phones.

271
00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.840
Well. you know.
he always was a bit odd.

272
00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.000
That's because
he feels threatened by women.

273
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.400
That's because
he feels threatened by women.

274
00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.840
Probably because he realises

275
00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.920
we should be the ones
running the world.

276
00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.000
We couldn't do a worse
job than them. could we? No!

277
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.520
We couldn't do a worse
job than them. could we? No!

278
00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.920
Going anywhere special?
I wish.

279
00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.720
The mayor's invited me
to drinks at the golf club.

280
00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:36.000
I'm only going because
Ceri's my best friend.

281
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.240
I'm only going because
Ceri's my best friend.

282
00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.080
God knows why she married him.

283
00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.760
Sorry. That was a bit harsh.

284
00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.000
But true.

285
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.120
But true.

286
00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.000
Richard. you made it. Welcome.

287
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.040
Richard. you made it. Welcome.

288
00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.440
Come here. come here. come here.
This is my wife Ceri.

289
00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.760
Ceri. this is Richard. the newest
addition to the town council.

290
00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.000
And our postman.
if I'm not mistaken.

291
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.520
And our postman.
if I'm not mistaken.

292
00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.760
Thank you. Don't be soft. There's
a few people I want you to meet.

293
00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.120
Nearly all the other councillors
are here. Oh. from Alwyn.

294
00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.000
Hello. Nice. Nice. Come on.

295
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.040
Hello. Nice. Nice. Come on.

296
00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.520
You know what I'm like about
religion. Give me your glass.

297
00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.800
The way her face lit up
on that Lyric stage.

298
00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:32.000
I bloody nearly converted
on the spot. This is Darek.

299
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.440
I bloody nearly converted
on the spot. This is Darek.

300
00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:38.080
He's Carmarthen's answer to
Leon Trotsky. only more left wing.

301
00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.360
I want you to meet our newest
councillor. Richard Goodridge.

302
00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.200
How's it going?
All right.

303
00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.000
Oh! Emlyn's boy. Ah!
You knew my dad?

304
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.080
Oh! Emlyn's boy. Ah!
You knew my dad?

305
00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:51.120
Aye. aye. aye.
He spoke about you often.

306
00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:55.000
Come on. you. let's go. Ha!
Right. Enjoy yourself.

307
00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.000
And on the nationalist end
of the spectrum. this is Aled.

308
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.800
And on the nationalist end
of the spectrum. this is Aled.

309
00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.320
He's a firm advocate of
the watchtowers and razor wires

310
00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.240
along the border. aren't you. eh?

311
00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.000
Don't forget the machine guns.
I won't.

312
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.440
Don't forget the machine guns.
I won't.

313
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:10.640
Welcome to Carmarthen's
corridors of power.

314
00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.000
Ah!

315
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:12.680
Ah!
(SPEAKS WELSH

316
00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.080
Thanks. Come on.
I want to introduce Richard

317
00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.560
to the councillors who
aren't on the lunatic fringe.

318
00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.000
Come on. I think the feeling
is he's insane. Yeah.

319
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.200
Come on. I think the feeling
is he's insane. Yeah.

320
00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.800
I know. I know. Oh! Oh. my God!
I wasn't. er...

321
00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:28.000
- Yeah. you were. It's fine.
- Come on. Oh!

322
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:28.400
- Yeah. you were. It's fine.
- Come on. Oh!

323
00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:33.840
Is she... single?
Yeah. I think so. OK.

324
00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.000
The last office Christmas
party. I had a few too many.

325
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.240
The last office Christmas
party. I had a few too many.

326
00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.400
I had a crack but
she was having none of it.

327
00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.240
Huh!
So I think she might be a lesbian.

328
00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.000
Oh. God!

329
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:44.440
Oh. God!

330
00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.480
Yeah.

331
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.120
I'm gonna go talk
to a good friend of mine.

332
00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.680
Yeah. And you're going to help
yourself to some nibbles. You OK?

333
00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:52.000
Absolutely. yeah. Nice.
Thank you. All right.

334
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.560
Absolutely. yeah. Nice.
Thank you. All right.

335
00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.480
Off you go.
Go on. go on. go on.

336
00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.520
You were all brilliant
in Jesus Christ Superstar.

337
00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:15.080
Anyone got any ideas
about what we put on next?

338
00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.000
Mam. you always do this.
You ask us to vote. then we vote.

339
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.840
Mam. you always do this.
You ask us to vote. then we vote.

340
00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.800
then you overrule us. OK?
Stop pretending this is a democracy

341
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.000
- because it's a dictatorship.
- I'm right.

342
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:24.160
- because it's a dictatorship.
- I'm right.

343
00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.480
A benevolent dictatorship.
Mam. we don't care.

344
00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:30.360
We already know what we're
doing next. so just tell us.

345
00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.000
Yeah. tell us.
It's exciting this. isn't it?

346
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.840
Yeah. tell us.
It's exciting this. isn't it?

347
00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:39.680
The next production that we're
going to put on at the Lyric

348
00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:40.000
is going to be...
Mam!

349
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.680
is going to be...
Mam!

350
00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:46.960
..Oliver.

351
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000
Auditions start on Monday.

352
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.160
Auditions start on Monday.

353
00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.560
He's the swing vote on this.
I know. I've done the numbers.

354
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.800
You'd better keep him close.
Did I leave my bag down here?

355
00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:56.000
Hiya.
Oh. hiya.

356
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.760
Hiya.
Oh. hiya.

357
00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.240
Thank you.

358
00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.840
I love what you've
done with your hair. It...

359
00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:04.000
It looks gorgeous.

360
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.880
It looks gorgeous.

361
00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.920
Thank you.

362
00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.880
Darek tells me you have got

363
00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.000
a master's in history
from the Open University.

364
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:12.720
a master's in history
from the Open University.

365
00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:15.640
That's very impressive.
Well. thank you very much.

366
00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:20.000
Medieval is my real
passion. But I love it all really.

367
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:20.200
Medieval is my real
passion. But I love it all really.

368
00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:24.560
Do you know...? Richard. Sorry.
Can I drag you away for a minute?

369
00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.600
I have to get going anyway.

370
00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.000
But. um. I'd love to hear
more about that at some point.

371
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.960
But. um. I'd love to hear
more about that at some point.

372
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.520
I just wanted
to go through the schedule

373
00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.320
for your first council meeting
on Monday. Now. we always start

374
00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.000
with the most boring stuff. Reading
the minutes of the last meeting.

375
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.280
with the most boring stuff. Reading
the minutes of the last meeting.

376
00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:41.880
approving the accounts.
that kind of thing.

377
00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:44.000
How are you. sir?
Good.

378
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:44.760
How are you. sir?
Good.

379
00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.600
I'm good. Quick. quick.
All the way down the end.

380
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.640
Good. Thank you.

381
00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.680
Yes. Yeah.

382
00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:52.000
Morning. Mayor Jenkins. It's all
so tedious. nobody bothers to argue.

383
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.680
Morning. Mayor Jenkins. It's all
so tedious. nobody bothers to argue.

384
00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:58.320
Then we move on to the reports
and the recommendations

385
00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.000
of various committees. This is
a little bit more interesting

386
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
of various committees. This is
a little bit more interesting

387
00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:05.520
but it can lead
to a lot of arguments. Hm!

388
00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.000
I have a proposal
here for a shopping centre

389
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:08.160
I have a proposal
here for a shopping centre

390
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.520
in the middle of the town.
This... Go on.

391
00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.440
..this will bring
jobs and money to Carmarthen

392
00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:16.000
and I think we should all get behind
it. Where in the middle of town?

393
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:16.720
and I think we should all get behind
it. Where in the middle of town?

394
00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:19.600
The Lyric Theatre.
What?

395
00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:23.800
This is my passion project. Huh?

396
00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:24.000
Come here.

397
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.440
Come here.

398
00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.720
That old cinema
is slowly falling apart

399
00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.000
and quickly going
out of business. huh?

400
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.280
and quickly going
out of business. huh?

401
00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:37.600
Nobody goes there any more.
the Lyric. not even the kids.

402
00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:40.000
They're all into their
skateboarding. isn't it?

403
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:40.040
They're all into their
skateboarding. isn't it?

404
00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.080
Skateboarding.
Hmm?

405
00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.880
I'm planning to build them a
special place for that in the park.

406
00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:48.000
No. no. no. This is a golden
opportunity to bring jobs

407
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:48.400
No. no. no. This is a golden
opportunity to bring jobs

408
00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.640
and life back to Carmarthen.

409
00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.680
Hmm?

410
00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.520
It's about securing
the future of our town.

411
00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.360
It's what Emlyn would have wanted.

412
00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.520
This is outrageous!
I'm calling a vote.

413
00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:04.000
All those opposed.

414
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.560
All those opposed.

415
00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.600
Aye.
Aye.

416
00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:11.040
Aye. Aye.
All those in favour.

417
00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.000
Aye.
Aye.

418
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.920
Aye.
Aye.

419
00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.920
Aye.
Aye.

420
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.560
Goodridge?
Aye.

421
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:28.000
I declare the motion carried.

422
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:28.200
I declare the motion carried.

423
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.000
I don't...

424
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.960
I don't...

425
00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.960
It's terrible.

426
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000
I've never seen such
a miserable bunch in all my life.

427
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.120
I've never seen such
a miserable bunch in all my life.

428
00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:38.520
Are you supposed to be happy or sad?

429
00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.000
Happy. So. why are you
all looking so bloody miserable?

430
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.480
Happy. So. why are you
all looking so bloody miserable?

431
00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.920
I want to see some
joy in your faces.

432
00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.000
Right. Jump up and down.
Shake it out. Right. Go again.

433
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.560
Right. Jump up and down.
Shake it out. Right. Go again.

434
00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.600
Remember. happy.

435
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
The council just voted
to knock down the Lyric.

436
00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.000
What? They're turning it
into a shopping centre.

437
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:04.120
What? They're turning it
into a shopping centre.

438
00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.560
They can't.
They already have.

439
00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:12.000
Mayor Jenkins.
I've just learned that the council

440
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.160
Mayor Jenkins.
I've just learned that the council

441
00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.400
has voted to turn the Lyric
into a shopping centre.

442
00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.640
Oh! Hello. Mrs Evans.

443
00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.000
That's correct.

444
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:20.680
That's correct.

445
00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.160
It was a majority decision.

446
00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.200
But you can't do that.

447
00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.240
A town without a theatre
loses its heart.

448
00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.000
Children without
creativity lose hope.

449
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.280
Children without
creativity lose hope.

450
00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.120
Am I right. David?
Yes. Liz. you are. yeah.

451
00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:35.120
When I was elected mayor. I promised
to bring prosperity to Carmarthen.

452
00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.000
That's exactly what we're doing.

453
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.640
That's exactly what we're doing.

454
00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.440
Bringing chain stores in here will
force local shops out of business.

455
00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.680
It's happening all over the place.
Am I right. David?

456
00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.000
Yes. Liz. yes.
We've made our decision.

457
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.120
Yes. Liz. yes.
We've made our decision.

458
00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:50.040
I'm putting on another production.
Not at the Lyric. you won't.

459
00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.000
The bulldozers arrive in two weeks.
Bulldozers?

460
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:52.480
The bulldozers arrive in two weeks.
Bulldozers?

461
00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.600
It's a listed building.

462
00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.640
It's a pity. I know.

463
00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.680
But we've done a preliminary
structural report

464
00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.000
and it looks like we'll be forced
to condemn the whole building.

465
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.720
and it looks like we'll be forced
to condemn the whole building.

466
00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.760
I'll fight you in court.

467
00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.000
Ohh! Come on now. Liz.

468
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.520
Ohh! Come on now. Liz.

469
00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:13.280
You're not going to waste all
your family's money on a lawsuit.

470
00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.920
Don't try us. Mayor.

471
00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.280
You can't win.
Maybe not

472
00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:23.400
but I can force you to delay
for months. a year even.

473
00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.000
And how are you going to square
that with your developer friends?

474
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.040
And how are you going to square
that with your developer friends?

475
00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.000
All right. You've got a month
if you stay out of the courts.

476
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.640
All right. You've got a month
if you stay out of the courts.

477
00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.000
Now. Tristan. Pete.

478
00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.000
Same again? Right.
Can I get two pints of lager?

479
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.080
Same again? Right.
Can I get two pints of lager?

480
00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.000
I bet they're all getting kickbacks
from the bloody developers.

481
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.040
I bet they're all getting kickbacks
from the bloody developers.

482
00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:51.200
Honestly. love.

483
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.920
you were brilliant. There's
nothing else you could have done.

484
00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.000
Listen to me. we are gonna make sure

485
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.040
Listen to me. we are gonna make sure

486
00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:01.240
the last ever performance at the
Lyric is something to remember.

487
00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.520
I promise you. All right?

488
00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:04.000
Come on.

489
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.560
Come on.

490
00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.200
All right. lads.
let's gather round now.

491
00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:28.000
a little bit of a warm-up.
Here we go. Yep. go.

492
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:28.240
a little bit of a warm-up.
Here we go. Yep. go.

493
00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:31.320
That's it. Nice and low.
Yeah. start free. eh?

494
00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.840
You know what they.
no pain. no gain. That's it.

495
00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:36.000
Five and six and seven and eight.

496
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:36.640
Five and six and seven and eight.

497
00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.040
Star jumps. Star jumps.

498
00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.280
And turn. Now run on the spot.

499
00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:44.000
Eat your heart out. Come on.
Faster. Drumming. boys. Drumming!

500
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.080
Eat your heart out. Come on.
Faster. Drumming. boys. Drumming!

501
00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.120
And shake it out.

502
00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.000
A few exercises. Shoulder roll.

503
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:52.520
A few exercises. Shoulder roll.

504
00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:56.560
Roll. roll. I haven't seen
your mam at the salon for a while.

505
00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.040
Let's have a little bit of energy.
We've got a show to do.

506
00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:00.000
Thanks. Steve. Gather round.

507
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.840
Thanks. Steve. Gather round.

508
00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.880
Gather round.

509
00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.000
Nick Jones. chewing gum. out.

510
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.160
Nick Jones. chewing gum. out.

511
00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.320
Sorry.

512
00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:15.520
Remember. it's no good
just singing the words.

513
00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:21.000
You have to feel them
and mean it. Understand?

514
00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.560
Yes.
Yes. Liz.

515
00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:24.000
What do you mean I ain't got
no manners? I'm a regular gent.

516
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.600
What do you mean I ain't got
no manners? I'm a regular gent.

517
00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:29.360
Permit me to assist
you across the road.

518
00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.960
Well. I was only
going to the Palace.

519
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Doorman!

520
00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.680
A cab. if you please.

521
00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:40.000
What are we going to do when
they close this place down. Miss?

522
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.040
What are we going to do when
they close this place down. Miss?

523
00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.120
It'll be just terrible.

524
00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.360
Nothing is going
to happen to Youth Opera.

525
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.000
I can promise you that.
Shall we show them how it's done?

526
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.840
I can promise you that.
Shall we show them how it's done?

527
00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.720
Yes!

528
00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.720
Right!

529
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.040
Off!

530
00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.000
What's wrong with you?

531
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.160
What's wrong with you?

532
00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:51.960
Right now.
you should be on your way home...

533
00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.280
..to your family...

534
00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.600
..and your bed.

535
00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.400
Instead. you're here...

536
00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.120
..in the Lyric.

537
00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.000
You're bonkers.

538
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:16.880
You're bonkers.

539
00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:16.080
Liz?

540
00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.440
Liz!

541
00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.480
Liz.
I'm sorry.

542
00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.160
Oh! Oh!

543
00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.920
I'm so sorry.
Are you all right?

544
00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.480
I woke up this morning and you
weren't there. I was worried sick.

545
00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:44.000
I'm sorry. Ohh!
I just crashed out.

546
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.560
I'm sorry. Ohh!
I just crashed out.

547
00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.920
Oh! You probably want to have
a shower before you go to work.

548
00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:51.280
I'm not going to work.

549
00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:52.000
Oh. no. You're not
feeling sick. are you?

550
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.360
Oh. no. You're not
feeling sick. are you?

551
00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:56.040
No. no. no. no. Then go home
and have a kip. love. Come on.

552
00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:00.000
No. I feel fine. I'm staying here.

553
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:00.160
No. I feel fine. I'm staying here.

554
00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.000
What?

555
00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.680
I'm not going to let them
knock this place down.

556
00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:08.000
Liz. look. they've made
their decision. all right?

557
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:08.440
Liz. look. they've made
their decision. all right?

558
00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.400
The builders are
arriving this morning.

559
00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.440
Then they'll have to
knock it down with me in it.

560
00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:14.400
This is not what we agreed.

561
00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.000
We didn't agree anything because
I only just decided to do this.

562
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.760
We didn't agree anything because
I only just decided to do this.

563
00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:20.080
Oh. David.
Oh. for Christ's sake. Liz.

564
00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:22.560
You've got a home and a family
to take care of. you know?

565
00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.000
Stop being ridiculous. Oh. I'm
the one being ridiculous. is it?

566
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.400
Stop being ridiculous. Oh. I'm
the one being ridiculous. is it?

567
00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.320
I don't believe it.

568
00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:30.600
Oh! David. Cariad!

569
00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:40.000
What do you lot think you're doing?
We were told the place was vacant.

570
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:40.880
What do you lot think you're doing?
We were told the place was vacant.

571
00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:43.600
Does it look vacant to you?
We've got a job to do. love.

572
00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:46.720
You need to get out of there.
And you need to get on your bike.

573
00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:48.000
I'll talk to my boss.
We'll be back first thing.

574
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.600
I'll talk to my boss.
We'll be back first thing.

575
00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:51.760
And it won't be vacant then. either.

576
00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:55.320
I'll call you back. You assured
me that that building was empty.

577
00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.000
What are you talking about?

578
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.400
What are you talking about?

579
00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:01.400
There is a woman
in the Lyric Theatre.

580
00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:04.000
Well. get your men to throw her out.

581
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:04.040
Well. get your men to throw her out.

582
00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:06.560
They're construction workers
not bouncers.

583
00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.640
Then get the police to do it.

584
00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:11.320
Well. they might to want to see a
court order and to get one of those

585
00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:12.000
we might have to answer some
awkward questions about why

586
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.800
we might have to answer some
awkward questions about why

587
00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:17.080
we're trying to demolish
a listed building. Oh!

588
00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:19.120
Do you really want
to open that can of worms?

589
00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:23.560
Look. all my boys need is a day.

590
00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.440
and that building will be condemned.
All right. all right.

591
00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.000
You said it's a woman inside the
Lyric. Uh-huh! I'll talk to her.

592
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.280
You said it's a woman inside the
Lyric. Uh-huh! I'll talk to her.

593
00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.920
Your men will be able to
start work first thing tomorrow.

594
00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.000
All right?

595
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:36.880
All right?

596
00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:40.920
They'd better.

597
00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:10.080
Doll?

598
00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:14.280
Dolly?
Oh!

599
00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:16.000
How did you get in?
The old side door.

600
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.560
How did you get in?
The old side door.

601
00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.760
I thought the council
locked that up years ago.

602
00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.640
As you always say. Liz. where
there's a will there's a way.

603
00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:24.000
I've never paid to see a film here.

604
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.680
I've never paid to see a film here.

605
00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:28.040
Don't worry. I shut it behind me

606
00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:31.000
but you're going to need new
locks for all the outside doors.

607
00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.000
I put the word out.
So. what are you doing here?

608
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.920
I put the word out.
So. what are you doing here?

609
00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:37.280
Just because you've
taken a principled stand

610
00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:40.000
against the depredations
of crony capitalism

611
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:40.600
against the depredations
of crony capitalism

612
00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:44.120
and to preserve
the cultural legacy of our town.

613
00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:47.320
doesn't mean
you have to go out of business.

614
00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.000
Mrs Hughes is booked in
for a perm at 11.

615
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.760
Mrs Hughes is booked in
for a perm at 11.

616
00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.400
I told her to come straight here.
And she was all right with that?

617
00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:56.000
Thrilled. She's gonna be on stage.
She's telling all her friends.

618
00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:56.480
Thrilled. She's gonna be on stage.
She's telling all her friends.

619
00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.760
Liz! Liz!

620
00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:01.640
Oh. no!

621
00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:04.000
Liz! Oh!

622
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:04.120
Liz! Oh!

623
00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.480
You said you wouldn't
get in our way.

624
00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:09.880
I said I wouldn't take you to court.
Come on. Liz.

625
00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:12.000
This is ridiculous.
You can't just take over the place.

626
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.520
This is ridiculous.
You can't just take over the place.

627
00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:16.120
Well. that's what you're
planning to do. I'm the mayor.

628
00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:19.000
My job is to look after the welfare
of the people of Carmarthen.

629
00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:20.000
Keep up the good work.
Come right in. Mrs Hughes.

630
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.400
Keep up the good work.
Come right in. Mrs Hughes.

631
00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:28.000
You won't get away with this.

632
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:28.760
You won't get away with this.

633
00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.440
Ohhh!

634
00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.000
Hiya. What's going on?
We thought you might be lonely. Mam.

635
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.640
Hiya. What's going on?
We thought you might be lonely. Mam.

636
00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:57.080
So did I. But instead.
I've been run off my feet.

637
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.440
What's all this?
We just brought you a few things.

638
00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.640
you know. clothes.
stuff you might need.

639
00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:08.000
That's marvellous. Thank you.

640
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:08.920
That's marvellous. Thank you.

641
00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.640
Mam.

642
00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:13.880
You need to talk to Dad. OK?
Because he's in a right state.

643
00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:16.000
Well. that's between me and him.

644
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.240
Well. that's between me and him.

645
00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:20.120
It's none of your business.

646
00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:23.040
It is part of our business when
you decide to move into a theatre.

647
00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:24.000
Your dad's welcome
to be part of this.

648
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.280
Your dad's welcome
to be part of this.

649
00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:28.120
You all are.
Liz?

650
00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.560
I'll be a minute.

651
00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.000
Listen. why don't we
talk about this later?

652
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:32.760
Listen. why don't we
talk about this later?

653
00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.080
Whatever.
Oh. Huw!

654
00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:39.560
Come back later. OK?

655
00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:40.000
I'll try.
OK.

656
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.920
I'll try.
OK.

657
00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:45.080
Cariad. Me too.
Call Dad.

658
00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.000
See you later.

659
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:48.200
See you later.

660
00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.960
Cariad. Mam.
Caru chi.

661
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.240
Ta-ra. Mam.
Ta-ra.

662
00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.920
You sure you're going to be
all right? I'll be fine.

663
00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:04.000
I'd be happy to stay. I could get
some Mad Dog in and get hammered.

664
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:04.960
I'd be happy to stay. I could get
some Mad Dog in and get hammered.

665
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.360
Remember.
tomorrow morning. first thing.

666
00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:09.920
eight o'clock. the first
appointment. All right Ta-ra then.

667
00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.960
You'd better lock up.
I am.

668
00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:16.280
Oh-oh! Yeah. eh?

669
00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:18.480
I haven't been back here for years.

670
00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:20.000
I thought you'd like
a bit of company.

671
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:20.880
I thought you'd like
a bit of company.

672
00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:23.080
There's nothing I'd like more.
Yeah.

673
00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:27.240
Yeah. well. look at that.
Oooh! Eh? Come on.

674
00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:30.480
Look at this place.

675
00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:34.040
Oh! It's fantastic. isn't it?
I know.

676
00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:36.000
Come through here. Have a look.

677
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:36.840
Come through here. Have a look.

678
00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:39.120
Oh!
I know.

679
00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:41.080
You've got it all set up.

680
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.480
I fancied a change of scenery.

681
00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:51.840
What is it?
Guys And Dolls.

682
00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:52.000
Oh! Grand! Oh!

683
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.600
Oh! Grand! Oh!

684
00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:08.000
What's your family
think of this. eh?

685
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.640
What's your family
think of this. eh?

686
00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:15.560
Well. I think. for the boys.

687
00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:16.000
it's all a big adventure.
Mm!

688
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.360
it's all a big adventure.
Mm!

689
00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:21.280
They already think
I'm a bit bonkers.

690
00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.000
But. for David. it's different.

691
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.360
But. for David. it's different.

692
00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:31.480
He thinks I've got
my priorities all wrong.

693
00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:35.640
It's going to take a while for
people to get their heads around

694
00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:39.240
what's so important about
a broken-down old building like this

695
00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.000
that they have to turn
their lives around to save it.

696
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.280
that they have to turn
their lives around to save it.

697
00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:44.320
Eh?

698
00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.520
It doesn't look like much. does it?
Hm!

699
00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:50.600
You know I used to have a job here.

700
00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:54.040
No.
Yeah.

701
00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:56.000
Come on.

702
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.920
Come on.

703
00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.960
I want to show you something.

704
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
What?
Come on.

705
00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:04.000
I'm intrigued.
Yeah?

706
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:04.040
I'm intrigued.
Yeah?

707
00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:15.640
Oh. God!

708
00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:18.520
Are you all right?
What? Yeah. yeah. yeah.

709
00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:20.000
I'm just getting
a bit short of breath.

710
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.600
I'm just getting
a bit short of breath.

711
00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:25.920
Eh? I'm all right. Come on.

712
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.400
Oh! Wow!

713
00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:36.000
Oh! It's almost 50 years
since I worked here.

714
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.960
Oh! It's almost 50 years
since I worked here.

715
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.640
Well. it hasn't changed much.

716
00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:44.000
So. that was before you were
a teacher? Oh. yeah. long before.

717
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.440
So. that was before you were
a teacher? Oh. yeah. long before.

718
00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:48.480
Yeah.

719
00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:51.560
No. I was. er...
I was wounded in the war.

720
00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:52.000
And they sent me home and I got
a job here at the "new" cinema.

721
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.920
And they sent me home and I got
a job here at the "new" cinema.

722
00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.000
Oh! I must have seen over
a hundred films from up here.

723
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.880
Oh! I must have seen over
a hundred films from up here.

724
00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:06.200
What was your favourite?

725
00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:10.000
Goodbye. Mr Chips.

726
00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:12.040
Hm.
You know it? No.

727
00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:15.640
Oh! It's almost a perfect film.

728
00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:16.000
It's tragic. it's sweet. it's funny.

729
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.840
It's tragic. it's sweet. it's funny.

730
00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.000
It's... But the ending...

731
00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:22.920
Oh! ..the ending
is a real tearjerker.

732
00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.000
Yeah.

733
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.600
Yeah.

734
00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:31.040
Robert Donat is lying on his
deathbed and he's got one regret.

735
00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:32.000
that he never had
any children of his own.

736
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.720
that he never had
any children of his own.

737
00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:36.960
Yeah? Then he realises
he's wrong. see?

738
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000
He's had thousands of them. the
thousands of children he's taught

739
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:40.520
He's had thousands of them. the
thousands of children he's taught

740
00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:42.560
and whose lives he's touched.

741
00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:44.440
Ha!

742
00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:48.000
Well. after that.
I knew I had to become a teacher.

743
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:48.320
Well. after that.
I knew I had to become a teacher.

744
00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:56.000
Wouldn't it be great
if we could put on a film?

745
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.360
Wouldn't it be great
if we could put on a film?

746
00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:01.320
For who? Anyone.
anyone who wants to come.

747
00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:03.720
Well. I'd be up for it.

748
00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:04.000
How can we get hold of one?
Um... Well. there's nothing here.

749
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.200
How can we get hold of one?
Um... Well. there's nothing here.

750
00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.000
Do you remember Mr Tucker?

751
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:12.880
Do you remember Mr Tucker?

752
00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:17.680
Yes. I do.
He was my old history teacher. Yes.

753
00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:20.000
Well. we worked in here together.
Oh! He left before I did

754
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:20.600
Well. we worked in here together.
Oh! He left before I did

755
00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:23.680
and he formed
a film club in the town.

756
00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:27.640
He shouldn't have done. mind. but
he kept back a few 35-mil prints.

757
00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:28.000
Oh! Yeah.
Why don't I go and see him tomorrow?

758
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.600
Oh! Yeah.
Why don't I go and see him tomorrow?

759
00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:34.240
See what he's got.
That would be amazing.

760
00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:36.000
Wouldn't it? Mm!

761
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:36.600
Wouldn't it? Mm!

762
00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:38.640
That would be amazing. Oh!

763
00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:18.320
Morning. Mrs Jones.
Morning.

764
00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:20.000
Morning. Mr Hopkins.

765
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.560
Morning. Mr Hopkins.

766
00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:24.680
Lovely day. isn't it? Rubbish men
haven't been again this week.

767
00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:27.480
That needs organising.
It's a problem.

768
00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:28.000
I'll talk to the mayor
about it today. OK?

769
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.520
I'll talk to the mayor
about it today. OK?

770
00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:31.560
Your father would have
had it sorted by now.

771
00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.720
Only saying.
Have a good day.

772
00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:04.400
Um...

773
00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:06.440
All right?

774
00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:08.000
Hi.
I'm Dai. Nick is my boy.

775
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.240
Hi.
I'm Dai. Nick is my boy.

776
00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:12.480
Hiya. I... I...
I thought you were banged up.

777
00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:14.680
I'm out on parole. I am.

778
00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:16.000
Thought I'd make
myself a bit useful.

779
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.040
Thought I'd make
myself a bit useful.

780
00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:19.600
And there's not a lot
I don't know about locks.

781
00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:22.560
Oh. cheers. Dai.

782
00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.000
Thank you.
All right.

783
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:24.600
Thank you.
All right.

784
00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:32.000
Can you believe they want
to tear all this down? Yes.

785
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.680
Can you believe they want
to tear all this down? Yes.

786
00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:37.680
What do you mean?
Mam.

787
00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:40.000
I know how much
this place means to you

788
00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:44.400
but the truth is it's just a cinema.
a cold. draughty cinema that

789
00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:46.880
mainly shows films
that nobody wants to see.

790
00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:51.840
I thought you were with me on this.
We are with you. Mam.

791
00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:54.160
Turning this place into a shopping
centre would be a crime

792
00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:56.000
And I'm sure it's being done
for all the wrong reasons.

793
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.160
And I'm sure it's being done
for all the wrong reasons.

794
00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:00.320
But unless you can show
people why it's so important.

795
00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:02.680
maybe a shopping
centre is what they deserve.

796
00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:06.880
I've got more faith
in people than that.

797
00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:08.920
Yeah. Mam.

798
00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:11.240
You'll figure it out.

799
00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:12.000
Right.

800
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.600
Right.

801
00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:15.640
Oh!

802
00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:17.680
Front. back. side.

803
00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:20.000
No-one's getting in
you don't want to.

804
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:20.320
No-one's getting in
you don't want to.

805
00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:22.880
Thank you so much.
How much do I owe you?

806
00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:25.680
No. no. no. no.
It's the least I can do.

807
00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:28.000
What you've done for Nick.
I've never seen him happier.

808
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:28.280
What you've done for Nick.
I've never seen him happier.

809
00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:31.360
And I might have found myself
a new line of work.

810
00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:42.000
Hello!

811
00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:44.000
I'm still here.
I've got a structural survey here.

812
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.720
I'm still here.
I've got a structural survey here.

813
00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:50.200
it says the building is unsafe. I've
had professional builders in here.

814
00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:52.000
ones who have not been paid off by
the mayor and his developer friends.

815
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.040
ones who have not been paid off by
the mayor and his developer friends.

816
00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:55.000
who say it's perfectly sound.

817
00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:59.240
Oh. and if you see the mayor. you
can ask him why he let his daughter

818
00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:00.000
perform on stage
less than a week ago

819
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.320
perform on stage
less than a week ago

820
00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:04.320
if he thought it
was unsafe or dangerous.

821
00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:08.000
Oh. just so you know.
I'm not on my own in here any more.

822
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:08.440
Oh. just so you know.
I'm not on my own in here any more.

823
00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:12.720
Piss off!

824
00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:15.200
I guess that means you're not
planning to leave anytime soon.

825
00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:16.000
Good guess.

826
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:17.160
Good guess.

827
00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:23.480
Morning. Mayor. We really need
to sort out this bin problem.

828
00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:24.000
I know. I've got a meeting
with the union next week.

829
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.600
I know. I've got a meeting
with the union next week.

830
00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:28.840
Right now. I've got
bigger problems with the Lyric.

831
00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:30.640
Ugh!

832
00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:32.000
Liz Evans is refusing to budge.
Hmmm!

833
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.200
Liz Evans is refusing to budge.
Hmmm!

834
00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:35.680
Everyone was talking about that
on my rounds this morning.

835
00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:38.960
God! What were they saying?

836
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000
Just that she's not budging.

837
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Just that she's not budging.

838
00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:44.040
You know. she's doing
people's hair in there.

839
00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:47.200
Right up on the stage. It's... Huh.

840
00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:51.920
Interesting. The Lyric is licensed
as a place of entertainment

841
00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:56.000
not as a hair salon. If we can
prove she's working illegally...

842
00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:56.200
not as a hair salon. If we can
prove she's working illegally...

843
00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:59.200
Ha-ha! ..I can get
the police to kick her out.

844
00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:03.320
Do you think a few perms and
highlights are worth a police raid?

845
00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:04.000
They don't need have to go in with
guns a-blazing like in the movies.

846
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.040
They don't need have to go in with
guns a-blazing like in the movies.

847
00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:08.480
They just need to serve her
with a legal notice to quit.

848
00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:10.520
But we need proof.

849
00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:12.000
Huh! They're not gonna let me
anywhere near that place.

850
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.200
Huh! They're not gonna let me
anywhere near that place.

851
00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:17.120
You. on the other hand...

852
00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:19.800
No. I'm...
I'm not much of a spy. Mayor.

853
00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:20.000
Oh. everybody knows you. Richard.

854
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.920
Oh. everybody knows you. Richard.

855
00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:24.120
I don't think it's...
You're their postman.

856
00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:27.480
A couple of photos of what they're
doing is all we need. Go on. go on.

857
00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:32.280
Right.

858
00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:35.320
Just a couple of photos.

859
00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:40.520
Yes. sir.
Just a couple.

860
00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:50.360
Hiya.

861
00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:52.000
I was wondering if one evening
you might fancy a drink.

862
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.040
I was wondering if one evening
you might fancy a drink.

863
00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:56.240
I don't think so. Councillor.
Huh!

864
00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:59.480
I promise I won't bore you with
my Welsh medieval history stories.

865
00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:00.000
I thought you were
a nice guy until you voted

866
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.520
I thought you were
a nice guy until you voted

867
00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:04.200
to turn the Lyric
into a shopping centre.

868
00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:07.080
How much are they paying you?
Nothing.

869
00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:08.000
What do you mean? I know
he and his cronies are corrupt.

870
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.960
What do you mean? I know
he and his cronies are corrupt.

871
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.840
I know they're getting kickbacks.
What's your excuse?

872
00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:29.560
All right. There you go. lovely.

873
00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:32.000
There we go. Let's head over here.

874
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:32.680
There we go. Let's head over here.

875
00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:35.960
There you go. One second.
You don't want one. Liz?

876
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.880
What is it?
Oh. it's my experimental cocktail.

877
00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:40.000
Three parts brandy.
two parts rum. tomato juice

878
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.560
Three parts brandy.
two parts rum. tomato juice

879
00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:45.920
and a splash of vodka.
It sounds horrible. It does.

880
00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:48.000
That's where you're wrong. Goes down
like a homesick mole. doesn't it?

881
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.360
That's where you're wrong. Goes down
like a homesick mole. doesn't it?

882
00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:56.000
Dolly. can you
take over for a minute?

883
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:56.920
Dolly. can you
take over for a minute?

884
00:50:58.320 --> 00:50:59.960
Er. yeah. course.

885
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.000
Have a look around here.

886
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:04.120
Have a look around here.

887
00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:11.960
Hi.

888
00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:17.080
Hiya. You all right?

889
00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:20.000
Is there somewhere we can talk?

890
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:20.960
Is there somewhere we can talk?

891
00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:32.520
You know. I was thinking.

892
00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:35.960
I think our first ever
kiss was right here.

893
00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:39.600
No.

894
00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:42.880
It was right there. in fact.

895
00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:44.000
And I certainly remember it.

896
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.560
And I certainly remember it.

897
00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:52.000
How can you not love this place?

898
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.240
How can you not love this place?

899
00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:55.880
It's part of our history.

900
00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:59.240
Yeah.

901
00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:03.000
I guess the world
has moved on. Libby.

902
00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:11.040
What's bothering you?

903
00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:14.520
Oh. it's nothing. It's just...

904
00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:19.200
A lot of the men
need the work. love.

905
00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:21.600
It's years of
employment being offered

906
00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:23.640
to build the shopping centre.

907
00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:24.000
Nobody wants to see
Youth Opera closed. they just...

908
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.560
Nobody wants to see
Youth Opera closed. they just...

909
00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:30.680
Well. they...

910
00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:36.280
It's just a building. innit?

911
00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:39.680
No.

912
00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:42.680
No. it's not.

913
00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:48.000
The Lyric is staying.

914
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:48.800
The Lyric is staying.

915
00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:03.960
Liz!

916
00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:08.760
Oh!

917
00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:12.000
Hey. I've got it. huh?
That's fantastic.

918
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.360
Hey. I've got it. huh?
That's fantastic.

919
00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:18.320
Take this. it's heavy. mind.
OK. There.

920
00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:20.000
What is it?
How Green Was My Valley.

921
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:20.960
What is it?
How Green Was My Valley.

922
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.320
How Green Was My Valley?

923
00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:26.440
Yeah. It's a classic.
You must have seen it.

924
00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:28.000
Well. I read the book at school.

925
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:28.880
Well. I read the book at school.

926
00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:33.880
Is that all Mr Tucker had?
Yeah. pretty much but it's perfect.

927
00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:36.000
It was made in 1941.

928
00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:39.800
So. it's in black and white?
Of course. Yeah.

929
00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:41.800
Now look at this. see? See that?

930
00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:43.760
Directed by John Ford.

931
00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:44.000
Now he's the one that gave us
Stagecoach. The Searchers.

932
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.360
Now he's the one that gave us
Stagecoach. The Searchers.

933
00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:48.360
The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.
But this.

934
00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:50.640
this is the only
one that won the Oscar

935
00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:52.000
for best picture and best director.

936
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.560
for best picture and best director.

937
00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:57.320
Oh. I'm not sure the kids
are going to want to see this.

938
00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:59.960
Oh. we don't have
to worry about them.

939
00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:04.760
Don't we?
No.

940
00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:08.000
Young people are busy
making their own history. hmm?

941
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:08.120
Young people are busy
making their own history. hmm?

942
00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:10.960
It's only when you get to
a certain age you realise

943
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.800
that memory is the most
precious thing in the world.

944
00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:16.000
And that's before
you get to the age

945
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:16.120
And that's before
you get to the age

946
00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:19.640
when you realise that memory
is the only thing you have left.

947
00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:24.000
Look at this place.

948
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.440
Look at this place.

949
00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:31.800
Oh!

950
00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:37.600
I mean. look at this place. huh?

951
00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:39.640
Oh. look.

952
00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:47.200
This place holds so many memories

953
00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:48.000
for so many people in this town.

954
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.640
for so many people in this town.

955
00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:54.960
And they're the ones
who will get behind you

956
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000
when they realise
what they're about to lose.

957
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.560
when they realise
what they're about to lose.

958
00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:04.000
Well. we'd better
let them know it's on then.

959
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:04.960
Well. we'd better
let them know it's on then.

960
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000
We should.

961
00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:52.000
How Green Was My Valley

962
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.360
How Green Was My Valley

963
00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:56.080
I remember that. love.

964
00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:58.960
It's at the Lyric.
Yeah? Yeah.

965
00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:20.000
Excuse me. Do you know what's on?

966
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:20.960
Excuse me. Do you know what's on?

967
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.000
They're showing
How Green Was My Valley for free.

968
00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:40.720
I am packing my belongings in
the shawl my mother used to wear

969
00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:44.000
when she went to the market.
And I am going from my valley.

970
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:44.200
when she went to the market.
And I am going from my valley.

971
00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:47.440
And this time I shall never return.

972
00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:51.720
I am leaving behind me
my 50 years of memory.

973
00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:52.000
Memory.

974
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.560
Memory.

975
00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:56.120
Strange that the mind... Richard!
..will forget... Richard!

976
00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:58.600
..so much of what only
this moment is past... Sit here.

977
00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:00.000
..and yet hold clear and bright the
memory of what happened years ago.

978
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.120
..and yet hold clear and bright the
memory of what happened years ago.

979
00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:05.240
of men and women long since dead.

980
00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:08.000
Yet who shall say what
is real and what is not?

981
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:08.760
Yet who shall say what
is real and what is not?

982
00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:11.200
And I believe my friends all gone...
Pick and Mix?

983
00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:15.080
..when their voices
are still a glory in my ears?

984
00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:16.000
No. And I will stand
to say no and no again.

985
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.800
No. And I will stand
to say no and no again.

986
00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:21.960
for they remain a living
truth within my mind.

987
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000
There is no fence nor hedge
round Time that is gone.

988
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.680
There is no fence nor hedge
round Time that is gone.

989
00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:29.560
And the valley would ring
with the sound of many voices.

990
00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:32.000
for singing is in my people
as sight is in the eye.

991
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:32.840
for singing is in my people
as sight is in the eye.

992
01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:43.400
Men like my father cannot die.

993
01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:45.480
They are with me still.

994
01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:48.000
real in memory
as they were in flesh.

995
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:48.760
real in memory
as they were in flesh.

996
01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:51.320
loving and beloved forever.

997
01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:54.240
How green was my valley then.

998
01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:55.720
What?
Yankee sugar-coated bullshit.

999
01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:58.840
Those cheery miners
singing like Disney dwarfs.

1000
01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:00.000
They're victims of
capitalist exploitation.

1001
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.120
They're victims of
capitalist exploitation.

1002
01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:04.640
Have you no bloody soul? It's
a celebration of a way of life.

1003
01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:08.000
- And they seem to like it.
- More! Yeah!

1004
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.840
- And they seem to like it.
- More! Yeah!

1005
01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:13.880
Miserable sod.

1006
01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:20.160
Thank you so much for coming.

1007
01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:23.880
I saw a tear in your eye
during some of those scenes.

1008
01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:24.000
It was very dusty in there.
Aye. aye.

1009
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.920
It was very dusty in there.
Aye. aye.

1010
01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:30.720
We can agree to disagree
about Hollywood's

1011
01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:32.000
depiction of Welsh culture

1012
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:32.760
depiction of Welsh culture

1013
01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:35.000
but that's the point
of the arts. isn't it?

1014
01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:37.440
They cause controversy.
Oh. absolutely.

1015
01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:40.000
That's why we've got to join
the fight to save this place

1016
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:40.560
That's why we've got to join
the fight to save this place

1017
01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:42.600
from that sleazeball of a mayor.

1018
01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:45.960
I mean. a new Woolworths
doesn't spark much debate. does it?

1019
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Well. their pick and mix does.

1020
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Well. their pick and mix does.

1021
01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:52.800
Congratulations to both of you.
I thought that went really well. eh?

1022
01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:54.800
Fabulous. Yeah.
I loved the singing.

1023
01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:56.000
Did you hear me? I was upstairs
singing. No. Yes. yes.

1024
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.240
Did you hear me? I was upstairs
singing. No. Yes. yes.

1025
01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:00.560
- I took a solo.
- Oh!

1026
01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.840
Why don't you come by
tomorrow night for dinner?

1027
01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.000
We'll work out what
we're going to put on next.

1028
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:04.920
We'll work out what
we're going to put on next.

1029
01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:07.200
Yeah. yeah. I'd like that.

1030
01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:36.000
Carmarthen Police
Get me SI Roberts on the phone.

1031
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:36.240
Carmarthen Police
Get me SI Roberts on the phone.

1032
01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:58.720
I'm coming.

1033
01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:08.000
Liz Evans? Yes.
This is a warrant for your arrest.

1034
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.400
Liz Evans? Yes.
This is a warrant for your arrest.

1035
01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:18.040
Go back.

1036
01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:21.480
Go back. inside. inside.

1037
01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:29.520
Right. Here we go.

1038
01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:38.120
Good. Let me know the minute
the building is totally cleared.

1039
01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:44.640
Susan? Susan!

1040
01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:48.000
Susan!

1041
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:48.040
Susan!

1042
01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:52.720
We need to get social services
down here right away.

1043
01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:56.000
There's two minors at least.
There's nothing we can do about it.

1044
01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:56.200
There's two minors at least.
There's nothing we can do about it.

1045
01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:58.400
I'm from the council.

1046
01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:01.320
Mam?
Stop what you're doing.

1047
01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:03.960
Who are you?
Their lawyer. Sorry I'm late.

1048
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.520
You can tell your clients.
I've got them bang to rights.

1049
01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:09.680
Bang to rights? You've been
watching too many police dramas.

1050
01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:12.000
OK. Criminal trespass and
operating an unlicensed business.

1051
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
OK. Criminal trespass and
operating an unlicensed business.

1052
01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:17.520
And the complaint
was filed by USG Screens.

1053
01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:20.000
I represent USG.
My clients lease this building.

1054
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:20.400
I represent USG.
My clients lease this building.

1055
01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:22.680
Excellent. Do you have
a copy of the lease with you?

1056
01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:30.960
Thank you.

1057
01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:36.000
Paragraph 15.

1058
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.320
Paragraph 15.

1059
01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:41.240
grants access to employees
of the town council.

1060
01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:44.000
See? Well. we won't
be arresting you then.

1061
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.160
See? Well. we won't
be arresting you then.

1062
01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:49.840
But they're coming with me.
No. no. please. It's OK.

1063
01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:52.000
Look at me. look at me.

The stage of the Lyric Theatre

1066
01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:58.280
will be made available
to the Carmarthen Youth Opera

01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:00.000
up to four times a year.

1068
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:00.320
up to four times a year.

1069
01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:03.800
They are the principals of
the Carmarthen Youth Opera.

1070
01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:07.520
It's them. I saw them in Jesus
Christ Superstar. It was brilliant.

1071
01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:13.280
We've still got them on
operating an unlicensed business.

1072
01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:15.880
Oh. Mam. please. Have you ever
been to a theatre before. officer?

1073
01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:16.000
That is a set.

1074
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.080
That is a set.

1075
01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:20.640
For what?

1076
01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:24.000
Um... Hairspray.
Oh! I saw the film of that. yeah.

1077
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:24.960
Um... Hairspray.
Oh! I saw the film of that. yeah.

1078
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.120
Debbie Harry was in it.
I was on my own mind but it was...

1079
01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:30.160
brilliant.

1080
01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:32.000
I suggest you release everyone
without charges and leave right now.

1081
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.280
I suggest you release everyone
without charges and leave right now.

1082
01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:35.320
Or you can tell the world
in open court.

1083
01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:38.080
that you arrested a bunch of
actors for being on a stage.

1084
01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:42.240
Thank you.

1085
01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:51.720
And we need that front door
fixed by the morning.

1086
01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:54.760
They did it.
So sue them.

1087
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.440
Susan!
Thank you so much.

1088
01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:10.480
How did you do that?

1089
01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:18.240
Have you boys heard the story
of how your mam and dad

1090
01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:20.000
fell in love on stage? Only about
a hundred times. Oh. yes.

1091
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.600
fell in love on stage? Only about
a hundred times. Oh. yes.

1092
01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:26.120
Stella... Stella! ALL: Stella!
That's you that is. It's Brando.

1093
01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:28.000
I have always depended on
the kindness of strangers.

1094
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.600
I have always depended on
the kindness of strangers.

1095
01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:31.800
That was pretty good.
I did not do it like that.

1096
01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:34.320
You did. Mam. You've got to admit
he's pretty good. isn't he?

1097
01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:36.000
Have you seen the film?
Have you seen the film?

1098
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:36.360
Have you seen the film?
Have you seen the film?

1099
01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:38.400
I haven't seen the film. no.
Marlon Brando.

1100
01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:41.600
Stella!

1101
01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:44.000
So. have you ever acted. Mr Morgan?
Ah! Yeah. well. in my dreams.

1102
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.560
So. have you ever acted. Mr Morgan?
Ah! Yeah. well. in my dreams.

1103
01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:47.600
Oh!
Yeah.

1104
01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:51.320
Must be wonderful. eh? Stand on
a stage. look out at the audience

1105
01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:52.000
and know you've got them
in the palm of your hand here.

1106
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.480
and know you've got them
in the palm of your hand here.

1107
01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:55.640
Must be the best
feeling in the world.

1108
01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:58.360
I love it. Hmm!
A bit like teaching.

1109
01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:00.000
You know. standing
in front of a class.

1110
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:00.880
You know. standing
in front of a class.

1111
01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:03.960
Yeah. Did you boys
like the film last night?

1112
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.280
Yeah. we did.
I mean. it was a bit cheesy.

1113
01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:08.000
Cheesy? But towards the end...
How Green Was My Valley cheesy?

1114
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.760
Cheesy? But towards the end...
How Green Was My Valley cheesy?

1115
01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:12.040
It was in black and white.
I don't agree with that.

1116
01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:15.840
So. what are we
going to put on next?

1117
01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:16.000
Well. whatever it is. it'll
have to be something popular.

1118
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.880
Well. whatever it is. it'll
have to be something popular.

1119
01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:21.760
This place has got to work
as a business. isn't it? Yes.

1120
01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:23.880
Otherwise. it will be
a struggle to keep open.

1121
01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:24.000
I agree. It's got to be something
that will bring the kids in.

1122
01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.720
I agree. It's got to be something
that will bring the kids in.

1123
01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:30.920
Your friends. Something new.
Something new. Something new?

1124
01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:32.000
Yes. Such as? Come on.
I haven't got a clue.

1125
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.120
Yes. Such as? Come on.
I haven't got a clue.

1126
01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:36.160
You've got school in the morning.

1127
01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:39.120
Oh! Oh! Well...

1128
01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:40.000
Well. that was a wonderful evening.
Thanks so much. eh?

1129
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.360
Well. that was a wonderful evening.
Thanks so much. eh?

1130
01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:45.640
I'd be happy to run you home.
Oh. no. no. no.

1131
01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:48.000
Oh. listen. could you bring those
cans of film for me sometime?

1132
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Oh. listen. could you bring those
cans of film for me sometime?

1133
01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:51.520
Yeah. No urgency. you know.
Tomorrow on the way back from work.

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:54.120
Yeah. All right. Nos da.

1137
01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:59.000
Are you gonna be all right now?
I'll be fine. Mmm!

1138
01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:02.560
Make sure they go to bed. Yeah.
I will. don't worry. You know.

1139
01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.000
Yeah. I know.
No television. OK.

1140
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:04.640

Goodbye. Mr Morgan.

Goodbye.

1144
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.160
Goodbye.

1145
01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:19.360
Right. I'll get you boys home. yeah?

1146
01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:20.000
Come on with me.

1147
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.400
Come on with me.

1148
01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:55.960
I thought you'd gone home.

1149
01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.040
Look. I just wanted
to come back and. er...

1150
01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:00.000
Well.

1151
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:00.080
Well.

1152
01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:02.960
ask your forgiveness.

1153
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
For what?

1154
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
For ever doubting you.

1155
01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:10.040
You proved to me...

1156
01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:12.920
Well. not just to me. to everyone.

1157
01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:14.960
that this place
is worth fighting for.

1158
01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:16.000
Look. I should have been all in
from the beginning. I know.

1159
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.640
Look. I should have been all in
from the beginning. I know.

1160
01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:24.000
But I am now... and forever.

1161
01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:24.360
But I am now... and forever.

1162
01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:29.480
Oh. David.

1163
01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:35.560
I love you.

1164
01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:37.600
I love you too. Liz.

1165
01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:40.000
They're very expensive. Oh. just
from the garage.

1166
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.960
They're very expensive. Oh. just
from the garage.

1167
01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:52.160
Mam! Mam!

1168
01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:55.200
Mam! Mam. look at this.
look at this.

1169
01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:56.000
What is it? It's a trade magazine.
We sent off for it.

1170
01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.520
What is it? It's a trade magazine.
We sent off for it.

1171
01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:01.280
It has a list of all the films that
are coming out. Look at The Firm.

1172
01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:03.440
That's with Tom Cruise in it.
That'll be really good.

1173
01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:04.000
Or Free Willy.
That looks even better.

1174
01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.440
Or Free Willy.
That looks even better.

1175
01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:10.440
Jurassic Park by Steven Spielberg.
I think it's about dinosaurs.

1176
01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:12.000
I've read the book.
Oh. it's fantastic.

1177
01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:12.760
I've read the book.
Oh. it's fantastic.

1178
01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:15.480
So. they find these mosquitos
that have been trapped in amber

1179
01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:18.360
for. like. millions of years.
But before they died.

1180
01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:20.000
the mosquitos had bitten dinosaurs
and had the dinosaur blood in them.

1181
01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.840
the mosquitos had bitten dinosaurs
and had the dinosaur blood in them.

1182
01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:24.240
So. they get the dinosaur
blood out of the mosquitos.

1183
01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:26.880
they sequence the dino DNA
and then... No. no. Stop it.

1184
01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:28.000
You're gonna spoil it for us.
Um...

1185
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.040
You're gonna spoil it for us.
Um...

1186
01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:33.240
So. what do we think? Do we
think it's going to be a hit?

1187
01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:36.000
Are you joking. Mam?
Mam. it's going to be massive.

1188
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:36.240
Are you joking. Mam?
Mam. it's going to be massive.

1189
01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:38.760
It'll be the biggest ever.
Liz. I'd pay to see it.

1190
01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:44.000
Jurassic Park needs to be
the next film we show at the Lyric.

1191
01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:44.640
Jurassic Park needs to be
the next film we show at the Lyric.

1192
01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:47.280
How are we going to pull that off?

1193
01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:50.640
Where's there's a will
there's a way.

1194
01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:40.000
Mr Morgan.

1195
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:40.640
Mr Morgan.

1196
01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:43.640
Dai Evans.

1197
01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:48.000
Mr Morgan?

1198
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.320
Mr Morgan?

1199
01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:02.640
Oh. there you are.

1200
01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:04.000
I've got your film cans.

1201
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:04.680
I've got your film cans.

1202
01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:06.720
I can't stay long.
the van's badly parked.

1203
01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:10.800
Mr Morgan?

1204
01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:15.320
Please. no. Mr Morgan.

1205
01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:26.400
Because their words
had forked no lightning

1206
01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:28.000
They do not go gentle
into that good night.

1207
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.680
They do not go gentle
into that good night.

1208
01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:33.720
Good men. the last wave by...

1209
01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000
..crying how bright

1210
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.560
..crying how bright

1211
01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:40.720
Their frail deeds might
have danced in a green bay

1212
01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:44.000
Rage. rage against
the dying of the light.

1213
01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:44.480
Rage. rage against
the dying of the light.

1214
01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:49.280
Wild men who caught
and sang the sun in flight.

1215
01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:52.000
And learn. too late.
they grieved it on its way

1216
01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.480
And learn. too late.
they grieved it on its way

1217
01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:58.160
Do not go gentle
into that good night.

1218
01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:00.000
You're sure they're all there?
Absolutely sure?

1219
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.160
You're sure they're all there?
Absolutely sure?

1220
01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:05.080
As far as I can tell. And you.
my father... Right. ..there.

1221
01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:07.440
Susan.

1222
01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:08.000
Get me Martyn O'Byrne on the phone.

1223
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.640
Get me Martyn O'Byrne on the phone.

1224
01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:16.000
Putting him through on line one.

1225
01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:16.320
Putting him through on line one.

1226
01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:19.720
Martyn. It's empty.
Empty for how long?

1227
01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:22.560
For however long
a funeral in Dryslwyn takes.

1228
01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:24.000
It'll take the best part
of an hour to get the men

1229
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:24.480
It'll take the best part
of an hour to get the men

1230
01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:27.240
and the heavy equipment there.
So do it.

1231
01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:32.000
Rage. rage against
the dying of the light.

1232
01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.080
Rage. rage against
the dying of the light.

1233
01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:38.280
Now let us all join together

1234
01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:40.000
to celebrate the life
of Hywel Morgan.

1235
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:40.320
to celebrate the life
of Hywel Morgan.

1236
01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:45.280
First and foremost.
Mr Morgan was a teacher.

1237
01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:47.880
He taught hundreds of boys
and girls in Carmarthen.

1238
01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:48.000
I was one of them.
He inspired us all.

1239
01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.160
I was one of them.
He inspired us all.

1240
01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:54.000
The most important
thing he taught me.

1241
01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:56.000
he taught all of us.
is that this place.

1242
01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:56.120
he taught all of us.
is that this place.

1243
01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:59.800
its history. its identity.
its culture. its people.

1244
01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:03.400
makes us who we are.
makes us what we are.

1245
01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:04.000
He's called the builders.
Who has? The mayor.

1246
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.960
He's called the builders.
Who has? The mayor.

1247
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.120
He said to bring
the heavy equipment. How long?

1248
01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:12.000
Why do you care? How long
before they get to the Lyric?

1249
01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:14.560
An hour.
But that was 30 minutes ago.

1250
01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:18.000
We should all. every one of us.
be proud of our community...

1251
01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:20.000
Let's go.
..and our heritage.

1252
01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:20.040
Let's go.
..and our heritage.

1253
01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:23.320
As this community is threatened.
now more than ever

1254
01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:26.880
we need to honour his legacy
and continue his fight.

1255
01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:28.000
With Hywel Morgan's passing.
it is our turn

1256
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.320
With Hywel Morgan's passing.
it is our turn

1257
01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.720
to stand on the shoulders
of a giant of a man.

1258
01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:36.000
it's our turn to save
the soul of our community.

1259
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.120
it's our turn to save
the soul of our community.

1260
01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:41.000
It's our turn to rage
against the dying of the light.

1261
01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:43.920
Come on. Dad. Go faster.

1262
01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:44.000
We're not going to make it in time.
Come on.

1263
01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.320
We're not going to make it in time.
Come on.

1264
01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:06.080
Oi! Watch it!

1265
01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:08.000
Ugh!
Oi!

1266
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:08.960
Ugh!
Oi!

1267
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.440
Stop him! Get off!

1268
01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:20.760
Oi!
Ugh!

1269
01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:31.600
Come on! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

1270
01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:32.000
I'm stopping you from doing
something that will affect

1271
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.840
I'm stopping you from doing
something that will affect

1272
01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:36.320
the lives of everyone who
lives here. Councillor Goodridge.

1273
01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:40.000
Get down from there. No! I'm not
letting you destroy the Lyric.

1274
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:40.480
Get down from there. No! I'm not
letting you destroy the Lyric.

1275
01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:44.520
You voted for it. you clown!
It was a dreadful mistake.

1276
01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:46.680
Listening to you.
I made a dreadful mistake.

1277
01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:48.000
Get him down from there now. What
on earth are you doing up there?

1278
01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.600
Get him down from there now. What
on earth are you doing up there?

1279
01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:52.440
I don't know. But I'm part
of the town council now. so...

1280
01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:55.600
I don't care.
It doesn't put you above the law.

1281
01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:56.000
Tell that to bloody him.
If you don't move.

1282
01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.400
Tell that to bloody him.
If you don't move.

1283
01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:01.080
I'm going to have to arrest you.
Get him down! Get him down!

1284
01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:04.000
I've had enough.

1285
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:04.320
I've had enough.

1286
01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:08.120
Just swing the bloody thing.
Come on.

1287
01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:17.080
Be my guest. You do not have
to say anything... There you go.

1288
01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:19.760
..unless you wish to do so
but what you say

1289
01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:20.000
may be given in evidence. You're
gonna have to arrest all of us.

1290
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.640
may be given in evidence. You're
gonna have to arrest all of us.

1291
01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:25.360
starting with me.
Yeah. and me. And me.

1292
01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:27.880
Come on. woman! Do your job.

1293
01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:28.000
Arrest all of them. Arrest them!
Hello. Wendy.

1294
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.200
Arrest all of them. Arrest them!
Hello. Wendy.

1295
01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:34.320
Minister.
Oh. Christ!

1296
01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:36.000
On the subject of Christ.
our Saviour.

1297
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.040
On the subject of Christ.
our Saviour.

1298
01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:39.920
you're going to have to
arrest me as well. Go on. Father.

1299
01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:44.000
As mayor of Carmarthen.
I'm ordering you to do your job.

1300
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:44.400
As mayor of Carmarthen.
I'm ordering you to do your job.

1301
01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:47.800
I don't work for you. Mayor Jenkins.

1302
01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:50.120
I work for the people of Carmarthen.
Yeah.

1303
01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:52.000
So do I. I don't think so.
I think you work for him.

1304
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.640
So do I. I don't think so.
I think you work for him.

1305
01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:58.720
All right.
Right. you lot. Get this machine

1306
01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:00.000
out of here now.
I don't want to see you here again

1307
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.360
out of here now.
I don't want to see you here again

1308
01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:03.320
without a court order. Understand?

1309
01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:05.680
This is ridiculous.
Ah! You tell him.

1310
01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:07.360
Right. let's go. Come on!

1311
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.520
And I'm letting you
off with a warning.

1312
01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:16.000
Pick a side and stick with it.

1313
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:16.520
Pick a side and stick with it.

1314
01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:20.000
You're gonna get
a firmly worded letter from me!

1315
01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:22.120
Let's go in the Lyric.
Brilliant.

1316
01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:24.000
Cocktails for
everyone. Well done. Richard.

1317
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.920
Cocktails for
everyone. Well done. Richard.

1318
01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:32.000
Well. it seems I misjudged you.
Go on. It was very brave of you

1319
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.400
Well. it seems I misjudged you.
Go on. It was very brave of you

1320
01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:36.120
to jump on top of
a 10.000lb wrecking ball.

1321
01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:39.600
Really? 10.000lb?
Oh. give or take.

1322
01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:40.000
Oh! I just saw it and I couldn't
think of anything else to do.

1323
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.640
Oh! I just saw it and I couldn't
think of anything else to do.

1324
01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:45.920
Well. it worked.
Yeah.

1325
01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:47.960
But you know. um...

1326
01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:51.160
..there is something
else you could do.

1327
01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:56.000
I don't know the first
thing about being a bloody mayor.

1328
01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:56.080
I don't know the first
thing about being a bloody mayor.

1329
01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:58.120
But I do and I'll help you.

1330
01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:00.840
You know. win or lose.

1331
01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:03.800
you know. this could be
a platform to get our message out.

1332
01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:04.000
It could be a game-changer.
All right. I need one of these

1333
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.080
It could be a game-changer.
All right. I need one of these

1334
01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:09.320
to go through every letterbox
in Carmarthen. right?

1335
01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:12.000
I can do that. can't I? No. You're
excused from postman duties today.

1336
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.120
I can do that. can't I? No. You're
excused from postman duties today.

1337
01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:15.400
Instead. you are going down
to the Herald offices.

1338
01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:17.440
Lynn's expecting you in 15 minutes.

1339
01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:20.000
And then at three o'clock. BBC
Radio Wales want to interview you.

1340
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.040
And then at three o'clock. BBC
Radio Wales want to interview you.

1341
01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:24.560
Interview?
Yeah. You'll be fine.

1342
01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:28.000
Bloody Goodridge. This is absurd.

1343
01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:28.120
Bloody Goodridge. This is absurd.

1344
01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:32.080
All I know is. there's thousands
of them in people's letterboxes.

1345
01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:34.400
at lampposts. bus shelters.
All right. all right.

1346
01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:36.000
I get the idea.
But he's not even on the ballot.

1347
01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:36.880
I get the idea.
But he's not even on the ballot.

1348
01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:39.720
There's a space where you can
write in a new candidate's name.

1349
01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:43.920
Who's going to do that?
I also heard that Aled and Darek

1350
01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:44.000
have withdrawn from the election
and they're supporting him.

1351
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.640
have withdrawn from the election
and they're supporting him.

1352
01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:48.880
That's six votes for the
bloody idiot right there.

1353
01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:51.880
I'm trembling. He's giving
interviews to the Herald.

1354
01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:52.000
He's on the radio.

1355
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.920
He's on the radio.

1356
01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:55.960
You need to respond.

1357
01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
He's making this
all about the Lyric.

1358
01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:00.000
Nobody cares about that old ruin.

1359
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:00.040
Nobody cares about that old ruin.

1360
01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:08.000
Oh. morning. Liz.

1361
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:08.440
Oh. morning. Liz.

1362
01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:12.920
All right. Susan? So. how's it
looking on the dinosaur front?

1363
01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
The distributor gave us a flat no.

1364
01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:16.840
The distributor gave us a flat no.

1365
01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:20.960
They won't give a copy to
a cinema that's to be demolished.

1366
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Etcetera. etcetera. So I've
decided to go straight to the top.

1367
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.520
Etcetera. etcetera. So I've
decided to go straight to the top.

1368
01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:28.600
Who's at the top?

1369
01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:32.000
Dear Mr Spielberg.

1370
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:32.640
Dear Mr Spielberg.

1371
01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:35.160
My name is Liz Evans

1372
01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:38.600
and I run a youth theatre group
in Carmarthen. Wales.

1373
01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:40.000
We put on our performances
in the Lyric.

1374
01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:40.800
We put on our performances
in the Lyric.

1375
01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:46.080
an art deco building that was
turned into a cinema in 1935.

1376
01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:48.000
The town council. in its wisdom.
wants to knock down the building

1377
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.200
The town council. in its wisdom.
wants to knock down the building

1378
01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:53.840
and replace it
with a shopping centre.

1379
01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:56.000
Now. that's as far
as I've got for now.

1380
01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.400
Now. that's as far
as I've got for now.

1381
01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:00.480
But I'm going to go on and explain

1382
01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:04.000
how showing Jurassic Park
will help save the Lyric. Oh!

1383
01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:04.600
how showing Jurassic Park
will help save the Lyric. Oh!

1384
01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:06.640
I've got some of
the mayor's stationery.

1385
01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:10.080
It will look more official
if you send it on this.

1386
01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:11.920
Oh!

1387
01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:12.000
And then I'll intercept any
letters coming in from America.

1388
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.760
And then I'll intercept any
letters coming in from America.

1389
01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:16.600
Marvellous

1390
01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:18.320
On my rounds as a postman. every day

1391
01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:20.000
people talk to me about
their issues. bin collection.

1392
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.560
people talk to me about
their issues. bin collection.

1393
01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:25.600
transport. parking. schools.

1394
01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:28.000
Lots of them have ideas about how
to improve our lives in Carmarthen.

1395
01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:28.840
Lots of them have ideas about how
to improve our lives in Carmarthen.

1396
01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:31.320
Now. if I'm elected mayor.

1397
01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:33.800
my most important job
will be to listen to them.

1398
01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:35.840
Every single one of them.

1399
01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:36.000
He's a natural.

1400
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.360
He's a natural.

1401
01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:40.680
It's still odds on
for Tom to win. mind.

1402
01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:43.680
So we've got to get everyone
we can out to vote.

1403
01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:44.000
Radio...

1404
01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.720
Radio...

1405
01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:51.240
A lot of people have
read about your heroics

1406
01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:52.000
in the campaign to save the Lyric
Theatre. I'm not sure how heroic...

1407
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.440
in the campaign to save the Lyric
Theatre. I'm not sure how heroic...

1408
01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:57.040
Richard Goodridge is just a postman.

1409
01:21:57.080 --> 01:21:59.480
Yes? I'm there.

1410
01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:00.000
Thank you. The real hero is Liz
Evans who put her life on hold

1411
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.560
Thank you. The real hero is Liz
Evans who put her life on hold

1412
01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:07.000

I'm very proud of my community.

1413
01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:08.000
We're both very proud
of its history.

1414
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.080
We're both very proud
of its history.

1415
01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:11.240
Listen. We all need to be clear
that it's not for sale.

1416
01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:13.760
Not at any price.

1417
01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:40.000
You all right?

1418
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:40.200
You all right?

1419
01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:44.720
Still nothing from Mr Spielberg.

1420
01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:48.000
I'm sure he's busy
promoting his new film.

1421
01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.480
I'm sure he's busy
promoting his new film.

1422
01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:51.960
Besides. it's only
been a couple of months.

1423
01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:02.280
If we can't find a way
to get people to come here again

1424
01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:04.000
and start spending money...

1425
01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:04.320
and start spending money...

1426
01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:07.320
..I don't know what I'm going to do.

1427
01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:10.520
Hey.

1428
01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:12.000

1431
01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:20.000
Hey! Look at what
you've achieved so far.

1432
01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.560
Hey! Look at what
you've achieved so far.

1433
01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:23.760
Some of those people
here the other night.

1434
01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:26.720
they hadn't left
their house for weeks.

1435
01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:28.000
They hadn't seen
each other in years.

1436
01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.280
They hadn't seen
each other in years.

1437
01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:32.680
You brought them back together.

1438
01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:36.000
The Lyric is important.

1439
01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.480
The Lyric is important.

1440
01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:42.920
And you will find
a way to keep it going.

1441
01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:44.000

1442
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:44.880

1443
01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:46.880
Right.

1444
01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:50.120
Now get out there and vote.

1445
01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:52.000
I want to see the look
on Tom Jenkins's face

1446
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:52.480
I want to see the look
on Tom Jenkins's face

1447
01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:54.520
when he's booted out of his office.

1448
01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:57.800
All right.

Mr Mayor. Yes. That's me. Yes.
Mayor of Carmarthen. Wales.

1489
01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.720
Mr Mayor. Yes. That's me. Yes.
Mayor of Carmarthen. Wales.

1490
01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:13.760
Carmarthen. Wales.
It sounds so romantic.

1491
01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:15.760
Where in the world is it?

1492
01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:16.000
It's in Wales.

1493
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.400
It's in Wales.

1494
01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:21.120
Oh. yes. of course.
I'm sure it's very beautiful.

1495
01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:24.000
Listen. are you and Mrs Evans
free to speak in an hour?

1496
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:24.080
Listen. are you and Mrs Evans
free to speak in an hour?

1497
01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:26.720
Free in an hour? I don't think...
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1498
01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:28.760
Yes. yes. Great.
Yes. we are. yes. Great.

1499
01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:30.920
I'll speak to you in an hour then.
Bye-bye.

1500
01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:32.000
Unbelievable.

1501
01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.600
Unbelievable.

1502
01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:42.920
I'm coming.

1503
01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:46.120
Scissors and Combs. Dolly speaking.

1504
01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:51.120
Are you having me on?

1505
01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:54.200
You're joking.

1506
01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:56.000
Er... Er... All right.

1507
01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.920
Er... Er... All right.

1508
01:26:57.960 --> 01:26:59.960
Er. she'll be there.

1509
01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
OK. Bye.

1510
01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:09.600
Liz. Liz!

1511
01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:11.640
It's him.

1512
01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:12.000
Who?

1513
01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.680
Who?

1514
01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:15.600
Steven Spielberg.

1515
01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:18.840
What?
Steven Spielberg on the phone.

1516
01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:20.000
Don't be daft. He's not going
to be calling us on a payphone.

1517
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.600
Don't be daft. He's not going
to be calling us on a payphone.

1518
01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:25.440
No. He's calling the mayor's
office in half an hour.

1519
01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:28.000
Now. hang on. What about my hair?
This is peroxide.

1520
01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:28.560
Now. hang on. What about my hair?
This is peroxide.

1521
01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:31.320
Oh. I can have a go.
No offence. Dolly.

1522
01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:34.240
but there's only one woman who
does my hair and it's Elizabeth.

1523
01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:52.000
OK. Stay calm. stay calm.

1524
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:52.520
OK. Stay calm. stay calm.

1525
01:27:57.880 --> 01:27:59.880
Hello. Mayor Goodridge.

1526
01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:00.000
This is Steven Spielberg.
It's a pleasure to speak to you.

1527
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.640
This is Steven Spielberg.
It's a pleasure to speak to you.

1528
01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:04.560
It's a pleasure to speak to you too.

1529
01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:07.480
But you should be speaking with
Liz Evans. She's the one leading

1530
01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:08.000
the campaign to try and save the
Lyric Theatre. Shall I call back?

1531
01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.240
the campaign to try and save the
Lyric Theatre. Shall I call back?

1532
01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:12.280
No. she's right here.

1533
01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:15.520
I'll pass you over to her now. OK.

1534
01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:24.000
Hello. This is Liz Evans.

1535
01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.440
Hello. This is Liz Evans.

1536
01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:29.840
Mrs Evans. it sounds like you're
in the middle of a hell of a fight.

1537
01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:31.800
I am.

1538
01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:32.000
Can you believe
they want to knock down

1539
01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.920
Can you believe
they want to knock down

1540
01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:36.640
an art deco building
and put up a shopping centre?

1541
01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:40.000
So. you want Jurassic Park?
Yes. please. Mr Spielberg.

1542
01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:41.440
So. you want Jurassic Park?
Yes. please. Mr Spielberg.

1543
01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:45.520
I think showing your new film
would really help save the Lyric.

1544
01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:47.600
It would be tremendous.

1545
01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:56.000
What I'm going to do is. I'm going
to send you my personal copy

1546
01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:56.400
What I'm going to do is. I'm going
to send you my personal copy

1547
01:28:56.440 --> 01:29:00.400
and you can out it on three minutes
after the London premiere starts.

1548
01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:02.440
How's that?

1549
01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:04.000
Oh. my God! I...

1550
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:04.480
Oh. my God! I...

1551
01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:06.400
It doesn't seem real. I...

1552
01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:08.480
I don't know what to say. Er...

1553
01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:11.640
Oh. thank you.
Thank you so much. Mr Spielberg.

1554
01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:12.000
Good luck saving your theatre.
Thank you. Bye-bye.

1555
01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:13.760
Good luck saving your theatre.
Thank you. Bye-bye.

1556
01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:15.800
Thanks. Goodbye. Mrs Evans.

1557
01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:19.120
Oh. my God! He's gonna give
us the film. You're joking.

1558
01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:20.000
He's going to give us the film!

1559
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:20.600
He's going to give us the film!

1560
01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:33.960
Well?
You look great. Amazing.

1561
01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:36.000
I feel a bit of a...
No. no.

1562
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.640
I feel a bit of a...
No. no.

1563
01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:40.360
Honestly.
Are you sure? Really handsome.

1564
01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:43.600
Your hat.

1565
01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:44.000
No. Just carry it.

1566
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.800
No. Just carry it.

1567
01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:47.840
OK. OK.

1568
01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:52.000
Shall we?

1569
01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.880
Shall we?

1570
01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:56.320
Let's.
Knock 'em dead.

1571
01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:58.640
OK.

1572
01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:00.000
Mayor Goodridge.

1573
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:00.680
Mayor Goodridge.

1574
01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:01.920
Mayor Goodridge.

1575
01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:05.200
Good afternoon. Can you
tell us what we're going to see?

1576
01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:07.960
Enough now. Quiet.
There she is. Look. look.

1577
01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:13.040
You look beautiful there.
I couldn't believe it.

1578
01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:16.000
I thought that Richard and
Dolly were playing a joke on me.

1579
01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:16.720
I thought that Richard and
Dolly were playing a joke on me.

1580
01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:20.600
It really was him.
it was Steven Spielberg.

1581
01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:24.000
He's giving the Lyric his
personal copy of his new film.

1582
01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:24.080
He's giving the Lyric his
personal copy of his new film.

1583
01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:27.600
Liz. thanks very much. Love you.
And it's back to you in the studio.

1584
01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:30.000
Back to studio! Well done. Mam.

1585
01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:32.000
Well done. Mam. That was good.

1586
01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.120
Well done. Mam. That was good.

1587
01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:38.080
Hiya. Hi. Susan. I found a few of
these in storage in the town hall.

1588
01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:40.000
They're from when Prince Charles
visited ten years ago.

1589
01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:40.360
They're from when Prince Charles
visited ten years ago.

1590
01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:43.320
do you remember? Yeah. Anyway. I
thought we might be able to sue them

1591
01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:45.240
at the premiere.
Yeh! It's going to be great.

1592
01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:48.000
Is anyone famous coming? No. but
because it's a people's premiere.

1593
01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.680
Is anyone famous coming? No. but
because it's a people's premiere.

1594
01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:51.800
why don't we all just
pretend to be celebrities?

1595
01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:53.520
All right. Get to school now.
Come on.

1596
01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:56.000
Oh! Got to go. man.
Give us one of those crisps.

1597
01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:56.720
Oh! Got to go. man.
Give us one of those crisps.

1598
01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:59.160
No. Wynne. How's Richard?

1599
01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:01.640
Oh. he's great.
He's on his way to London.

1600
01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:04.000
Channel 4 were so impressed
with his interviews yesterday

1601
01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:04.400
Channel 4 were so impressed
with his interviews yesterday

1602
01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:06.240
they asked him to be
on the Big Breakfast.

1603
01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:08.640
No. No.
He's going to be in bed?

1604
01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:10.800
What? No. They're
interviewing him. Yeah.

1605
01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:12.000
That's how they do it
on the Big Breakfast. Yeah.

1606
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:12.840
That's how they do it
on the Big Breakfast. Yeah.

1607
01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:14.880
The guests get into
bed with the presenter

1608
01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:18.520
and she asks them questions.
Are you having me on? No. No.

1609
01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:20.000
Oh. yes. Give me those
crisps. You should pop by tomorrow

1610
01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.120
Oh. yes. Give me those
crisps. You should pop by tomorrow

1611
01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:25.440
and we'll watch it together
in the morning. All right.

1612
01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:44.000
I don't think we've ever had
a real live mayor in bed before.

1613
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:44.720
I don't think we've ever had
a real live mayor in bed before.

1614
01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:46.760
I'm just yanking your chain.

1615
01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:51.640
She's flirting with him.
Is it real gold? Mm-hm!

1616
01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:52.000
That's how they do it on the show.

1617
01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.520
That's how they do it on the show.

1618
01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:57.560
So you talked to Steven Spielberg?
Yes. just for a moment.

1619
01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:00.000
Then I passed him onto Liz Evans.
she's the one leading the campaign

1620
01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.240
Then I passed him onto Liz Evans.
she's the one leading the campaign

1621
01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:03.640
to save the
Lyric Theatre in Carmarthen.

1622
01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:07.640
It's her passion and her energy
that really got. er...

1623
01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:08.000
got Steven behind
the project at all.

1624
01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.200
got Steven behind
the project at all.

1625
01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:12.640
Passion and energy.
I like the sound of that.

1626
01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:16.000
What is it? Or should I ask who is
it you're passionate about. Richard?

1627
01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.320
What is it? Or should I ask who is
it you're passionate about. Richard?

1628
01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:23.440
I think...

1629
01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:24.000
I hope... they know who they are.

1630
01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.440
I hope... they know who they are.

1631
01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:29.480
That was Richard Goodridge.

1632
01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:32.000
Carmarthen's newest sexy mayor.

1633
01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:32.240
Carmarthen's newest sexy mayor.

1634
01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:34.520
What? See you after the break.

1635
01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:37.160
Richard. Richard!

1636
01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:40.000
Hello. Hello.
There he is.

1637
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.520
Hello. Hello.
There he is.

1638
01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:43.680
Thank you. Our local star.
You saw it then?

1639
01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:46.400
Yeah. it was brilliant.
Ah! Thank you. Thank you.

1640
01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:48.000
It was one of the strangest
experiences of my life

1641
01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:48.800
It was one of the strangest
experiences of my life

1642
01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:50.880
but I think I said everything
I wanted to for sure.

1643
01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:53.600
You were great this morning. Thank
you. You really were. Thank you.

1644
01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:56.000
The place looks amazing.
Oh! Speaking of which.

1645
01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:56.040
The place looks amazing.
Oh! Speaking of which.

1646
01:32:56.080 --> 01:32:59.960
Boys! Look what
I've got from London.

1647
01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:04.000
What are they?
Massive inflatable dinosaurs.

1648
01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.960
What are they?
Massive inflatable dinosaurs.

1649
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.960
Thanks. Whoa! Thank you.

1650
01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000

1656
01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:27.160
asking whether I'd like to go
for a drink with you sometime?

1657
01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:28.000
Yeah. Well. I've
thought about it some more.

1658
01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.200
Yeah. Well. I've
thought about it some more.

1659
01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:32.160
And I've decided I would.

1660
01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:35.400
You would?

You can. So. for this occasion.

1673
01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:00.000
I've invented a range
of prehistoric cocktails. Uh-huh!

1674
01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:00.600
I've invented a range
of prehistoric cocktails. Uh-huh!

1675
01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:03.120
This is a T-Rextacy.
Clever.

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:05.960
And that is a Velicirapture.
Right.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
And what's in it?
You don't want to know.

1678
01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:08.960
And what's in it?

Well. they promised me a limo

one of the first screenings
of Steven Spielberg's

1694
01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:21.240

1696
01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:27.760
You join me right
in the heart of Carmarthen...

1697
01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:28.000
Here in Carmarthen. there are no
freebies for the rich and famous.

1698
01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:32.560
Here in Carmarthen. there are no
freebies for the rich and famous.

1699
01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:35.240
Everyone has got to buy
their own ticket. The cost?

1700
01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:36.000
£2.50 or half price for children.

1701
01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.480
£2.50 or half price for children.

1702
01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:39.800
Doesn't seem to have stopped
anybody coming out. though.

1703
01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:42.160
Let's have a word with a few
of them. Who have we got here?

1704
01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:44.000
Hello. And you are?

Hello. And you are?
Hello. I'm Mavis. Mavis Jones.

1706
01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:46.640
And. Mavis. do you
live in Carmarthen?

1707
01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:50.200
Yes. I've lived here all my life.
I work in Tesco's on Pensarn Road.

1708
01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:52.000
And are you looking
forward to seeing the film?

1709
01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:52.240

1710
01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:54.640

1712
01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:58.880
it's back to you in the studio.

1713
01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:02.840
The combination of Princess Diana

1714
01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:05.560
and dinosaurs is obviously dynamite.

1715
01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:08.000
So Leicester Square came to
a complete halt this evening

1716
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:08.360
So Leicester Square came to
a complete halt this evening

1717
01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:12.200
as. inside. the Princess of Wales
greeted Sir Richard Attenborough

1718
01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:14.240
who plays the owner
of Jurassic Park.

1719
01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:16.000
Steven Spielberg himself has
suggested that children under 13

1720
01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.920
Steven Spielberg himself has
suggested that children under 13

1721
01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:21.920
shouldn't be allowed to see what
some have called Jaws With Claws.

1722
01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:24.000
Oh. yeah. We've got all
the bigwigs in tonight.

1723
01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:24.240
Oh. yeah. We've got all
the bigwigs in tonight.

1724
01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:27.120
Oh. thank you so much for coming.

1725
01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:30.800
- We're going to sit down now.
- I've got an idea.

1726
01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:38.640
Dave. it's only right
that the people of Carmarthen

1727
01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:40.000
should see Jurassic Park first.
Right. Not the London people.

1728
01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.680
should see Jurassic Park first.
Right. Not the London people.

1729
01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:43.840
So. what are you thinking?
Us.

1730
01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:48.000
Go on.

1731
01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:48.480
Go on.

1732
01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:50.200
There.

1733
01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:52.480
Yes!
Come on.

1734
01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:55.080
The townsfolk in
Carmarthen in North Wales

1735
01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:56.000
say nothing ever happens
in their town

1736
01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.440
say nothing ever happens
in their town

1737
01:36:57.480 --> 01:36:59.920
and their theatre never gets
new films like Jurassic Park.

1738
01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:01.880
But this year. they took a stand.

1739
01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:04.000
They appealed directly
to director Steven Spielberg.

1740
01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:04.200
They appealed directly
to director Steven Spielberg.

1741
01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:06.840
who arranged to have the film
make its debut in Wales

1742
01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:08.840
in their humble hamlet
and it worked.

1743
01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:11.840
Spielberg cut through the red tape
and arranged to get the theatre

1744
01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:12.000
a print of the film
for the premiere.

1745
01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:13.720
a print of the film
for the premiere.

1746
01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:16.280
It's a story with a happy ending.
Residents say

1747
01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:19.120
it is the most exciting
thing to happen in years.

1748
01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:24.360
Right. Let's go to a premiere.

1749
01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:36.000
We did it.

1750
01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:37.720
We did it.
