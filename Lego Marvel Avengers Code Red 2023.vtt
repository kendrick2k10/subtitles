00:08:05.583 --> 00:08:10.125
[sighs] Come on. Rollnir. We can do this.

182
00:08:10.208 --> 00:08:11.208
[grunts]

183
00:08:12.416 --> 00:08:13.708
-[Avengers cheer]
-Yes!

184
00:08:13.791 --> 00:08:15.916
[chuckling] Yeah. Thor! All right.

185
00:08:28.166 --> 00:08:30.500
Man. I am good.

186
00:08:30.583 --> 00:08:32.125
But we knew that already.

187
00:08:32.208 --> 00:08:33.791
Out of the way. Tony.

188
00:08:35.208 --> 00:08:36.416
Come on. Hulk.

189
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.750
Don't throw it this time!

190
00:08:38.833 --> 00:08:41.333
[strains. grunts]

191
00:08:41.416 --> 00:08:42.458
-What?
-Huh?

192
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.500
[giggles]

193
00:08:45.583 --> 00:08:47.833
-[pins clattering]
-Yes! Strike!

194
00:08:49.458 --> 00:08:52.833
Oh. man. Nat only needs one more pin.

195
00:08:52.916 --> 00:08:54.833
Oh. look at that. I'm up next.

196
00:08:54.916 --> 00:08:56.375
With a chance to win.

197
00:08:56.458 --> 00:08:58.333
[chuckles] Pardon me.

198
00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:04.375
[breathes heavily]

199
00:09:05.208 --> 00:09:07.500
Uh. that ball looks heavy.

200
00:09:07.583 --> 00:09:09.250
I don't want you to get hurt.

201
00:09:09.333 --> 00:09:11.583
Maybe you should try a different one.

202
00:09:12.166 --> 00:09:13.208
Dad.

203
00:09:13.291 --> 00:09:14.916
And focus.

204
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Block out all distractions and focus.

205
00:09:18.083 --> 00:09:21.041
Dad. back up. Please.

206
00:09:22.875 --> 00:09:24.500
[inhales deeply. blows]

207
00:09:26.333 --> 00:09:28.958
-Block out distractions!
-[grunts. stammers]

208
00:09:34.375 --> 00:09:35.833
Oopsie. You see?

209
00:09:35.916 --> 00:09:37.333
The ball was heavy.

210
00:09:37.416 --> 00:09:38.750
But that's okay.

211
00:09:38.833 --> 00:09:40.208
You can try again!

212
00:09:40.291 --> 00:09:42.625
-[laughs]
-Oh. boy.

213
00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:47.375
Little Natasha. don't be sad.
And don't give up.

214
00:09:47.458 --> 00:09:48.708
You'll get it next time.

215
00:09:48.791 --> 00:09:51.541
And your papa can be here to help you.

216
00:09:51.625 --> 00:09:52.666
Right behind you.

217
00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:55.125
Right there with you all the time.

218
00:09:55.208 --> 00:09:58.541
[laughs] Oh. my baby girl.
Always being so--

219
00:09:58.625 --> 00:10:01.416
Dad. stop it!
Stop pretending to be an Avenger!

220
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.500
Stop hovering over me all the time
and getting in my way!

221
00:10:06.458 --> 00:10:08.875
I-I-- I'm sorry.

222
00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.500
Let me make it up to you.

223
00:10:10.583 --> 00:10:14.791
Uh. this weekend. you and your papa
can both make pancakes together.

224
00:10:14.875 --> 00:10:17.250
[stammers]
Just like when you were little. huh?

225
00:10:17.333 --> 00:10:20.250
I am not a little kid anymore.

226
00:10:30.666 --> 00:10:33.083
Hmm. That anger's gonna eat her up.

227
00:10:37.375 --> 00:10:40.750
I can explain how to build
a quantum field Ping-Pong table.

228
00:10:40.833 --> 00:10:43.416
but I can't explain how dads work.

229
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:48.166
'Cause my pops was both my biggest fan
and the biggest pain in my iron butt.

230
00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:49.875
You wanna talk about it?

231
00:10:50.833 --> 00:10:52.750
Your angry death glare says. "Go away."

232
00:10:52.833 --> 00:10:55.666
But you know talking about it
will make you feel better.

233
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:58.583
My angry death glare doesn't work anymore?

234
00:10:58.666 --> 00:11:00.916
Oh. no.
It's still a great angry death glare.

235
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.375
Very scary.

236
00:11:02.875 --> 00:11:05.541
We're friends. Nat.
You can tell me what's going on.

237
00:11:05.625 --> 00:11:06.875
[sighs]

238
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.500
I shouldn't have yelled at him.

239
00:11:09.583 --> 00:11:12.458
But he keeps telling me what to do.
how to do it.

240
00:11:12.541 --> 00:11:15.875
Treating me like a little kid.
It just makes me so angry.

241
00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.458
It's not always easy to see
where they're coming from.

242
00:11:19.041 --> 00:11:20.791
I never understood that about my dad.

243
00:11:21.416 --> 00:11:23.416
At least not until after he was gone.

244
00:11:24.541 --> 00:11:26.583
[sighs] I didn't mean to blow up at him.

245
00:11:26.666 --> 00:11:29.291
But he has to realize I'm grown-up now.

246
00:11:30.291 --> 00:11:31.708
Maybe you need to tell him that.

247
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.500
[sighs]

248
00:11:45.291 --> 00:11:48.541
[sighs] Why did you have to grow up?

249
00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:50.791
Things were easier then.

250
00:11:52.416 --> 00:11:54.916
Ah. yes. I could use a hug.

251
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.833
Wait a minute. What is this?

252
00:11:56.916 --> 00:11:59.750
[grunting]

253
00:11:59.833 --> 00:12:02.208
[straining] Someone! Anyone!

254
00:12:02.291 --> 00:12:03.291
I can't--

255
00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.833
Natasha!

256
00:12:05.916 --> 00:12:07.583
Dad. Dad!

257
00:12:07.666 --> 00:12:10.000
We need to-- Dad?

258
00:12:14.875 --> 00:12:15.791
Dad?

259
00:12:19.041 --> 00:12:20.041
Dad!

260
00:12:20.833 --> 00:12:24.125
Sorry. how did we get
on the subject of Santa Claus?

261
00:12:24.208 --> 00:12:26.916
Ah. yes. The legend of Kris Kringle.

262
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.458
One of my father's favorite bedtime tales.

263
00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:33.958
Putting tiny little swords and axes under
the pillows of all the children of Asgard.

264
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.791
Whoa! Yeah. well.
Steve over here still believes in Santa.

265
00:12:38.875 --> 00:12:41.125
I might still hold a candle. [chuckles]

266
00:12:41.208 --> 00:12:43.541
Please tell me you still leave out
milk and cookies.

267
00:12:44.083 --> 00:12:46.000
Let me get this straight.
We have a Norse god.

268
00:12:46.083 --> 00:12:49.125
a man whose heart powers his armor suit.
a giant green man.

269
00:12:49.208 --> 00:12:50.791
but Santa is the reach?

270
00:12:50.875 --> 00:12:52.208
That's the bridge too far?

271
00:12:52.291 --> 00:12:54.291
[grunts]

272
00:12:55.541 --> 00:12:58.125
-Isn't that against the rules?
-Nope.

273
00:12:58.208 --> 00:12:59.666
Something happened to my dad.

274
00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:02.541
I-I found his phone on the floor.
but there's no sign of him.

275
00:13:02.625 --> 00:13:05.041
Tower security didn't log
Red Guardian leaving.

276
00:13:05.125 --> 00:13:07.250
But it did just log someone arriving.

277
00:13:07.333 --> 00:13:10.625
Red Guardian did not leave. He was taken.

278
00:13:10.708 --> 00:13:12.041
T'Challa?

279
00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:14.125
Apologies for my unannounced arrival.

280
00:13:14.208 --> 00:13:16.291
But I fear my most recent investigation

281
00:13:16.375 --> 00:13:18.750
may be connected
with Black Widow's father.

282
00:13:18.833 --> 00:13:21.750
I was pursuing
the villain known as Red Ghost.

283
00:13:25.083 --> 00:13:27.375
Here to stop me. Black Panther?

284
00:13:27.458 --> 00:13:30.583
[laughs]
Another game of cat and mouse. is it?

285
00:13:30.666 --> 00:13:33.208
Except this time. there is no mouse.

286
00:13:33.291 --> 00:13:36.000
There is only I. the Red Ghost.

287
00:13:36.083 --> 00:13:37.708
Drop the vibranium.

288
00:13:37.791 --> 00:13:40.291
I have better idea. Hear me out.

289
00:13:40.375 --> 00:13:42.833
-You run for your life.
-[weapon powering up]

290
00:13:42.916 --> 00:13:45.208
[laughs]

291
00:13:45.833 --> 00:13:48.458
Oh. You were so close.

292
00:13:48.541 --> 00:13:52.458
But no one gets the drop on the Red Ghost.

293
00:13:52.541 --> 00:13:54.583
-[laughs]
-[Black Panther grunts]

294
00:13:57.916 --> 00:14:01.541
By the time he gets downstairs.
I will be long gone.

295
00:14:01.625 --> 00:14:03.375
-[window shatters]
-What?

296
00:14:04.833 --> 00:14:06.000
Are you serious?

297
00:14:07.916 --> 00:14:09.750
[panting]

298
00:14:10.458 --> 00:14:11.791
[panting] Huh?

299
00:14:12.916 --> 00:14:17.083
[grunts. panting]
No one gets the drop on--

300
00:14:17.166 --> 00:14:19.333
[screams]

301
00:14:25.333 --> 00:14:27.291
[Black Panther]
Red Ghost could not have escaped

302
00:14:27.375 --> 00:14:30.000
under such mysterious circumstances.

303
00:14:30.083 --> 00:14:33.500
And he would not have left
the vibranium behind. Not willingly.

304
00:14:33.583 --> 00:14:35.625
And you didn't see who got him?

305
00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:40.291
No. But whoever or whatever took him
left behind this.

306
00:14:40.375 --> 00:14:44.541
The material is technologically beyond
anything that we have seen on Earth.

307
00:14:44.625 --> 00:14:47.041
Red Ghost disappeared.
so did Red Guardian.

308
00:14:47.125 --> 00:14:49.500
And no one's seen any sign of Red Skull.

309
00:14:49.583 --> 00:14:51.500
Weird coincidence.

310
00:14:51.583 --> 00:14:54.250
-[beeps]
-I have discovered a peculiar commonality

311
00:14:54.333 --> 00:14:56.291
beyond the three missing individuals.

312
00:14:56.375 --> 00:14:57.708
-Observe.
-Whoa!

313
00:14:57.791 --> 00:14:59.625
Omega Red. Red Raven.

314
00:14:59.708 --> 00:15:02.333
Red 9. Red Stone. Red Shift.

315
00:15:02.416 --> 00:15:03.500
Red King?

316
00:15:03.583 --> 00:15:06.291
So. what's the connection?

317
00:15:06.375 --> 00:15:08.625
Hulk. they all have the word "red"
in their names.

318
00:15:08.708 --> 00:15:10.083
And they're all marked missing.

319
00:15:10.166 --> 00:15:12.000
-Not all of them.
-[beeps]

320
00:15:12.083 --> 00:15:13.291
[Iron Man] Red She-Hulk?

321
00:15:13.375 --> 00:15:16.125
The only superpowered individual
with "red" in their name

322
00:15:16.208 --> 00:15:17.541
who has not vanished.

323
00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:20.541
Um… I might know where to find her.

324
00:15:20.625 --> 00:15:23.916
Good. She might be our only lead
to finding my dad.

325
00:15:25.208 --> 00:15:26.208

-[punches landing]
-[Red Ghost] Can you get out?

327
00:15:28.208 --> 00:15:31.583
-[Red Skull grunts] No!
-[grunts]

328
00:15:31.666 --> 00:15:34.041
What is this? Where are we?

329
00:15:34.125 --> 00:15:37.375
Ah. good. You're awake.

330
00:15:37.458 --> 00:15:40.208
Red Ghost. Red Guardian. Red Skull.

331
00:15:40.291 --> 00:15:42.875
It's nice to finally meet you in person.

332
00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.500
And you've met my robots already.

333
00:15:46.291 --> 00:15:47.250
Huh?

334
00:15:49.041 --> 00:15:50.291
Broken?

335
00:15:50.375 --> 00:15:51.375
Broken?

336
00:15:52.083 --> 00:15:56.666
[sighs] Bumps you down
from near mint to very fine.

337
00:15:57.166 --> 00:15:59.583
-[grunts] Not worth keeping.
-[device beeps]

338
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:02.875
Red Guardian.

339
00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:07.625
Not exactly a spring chicken anymore.
but I like the look of you.

340
00:16:07.708 --> 00:16:09.541
Oh. thank you.

341
00:16:09.625 --> 00:16:12.583
People think it's about exercise.
but. uh… [chuckles]

342
00:16:12.666 --> 00:16:16.291
…it really comes down
to calories in. calories out.

343
00:16:16.375 --> 00:16:20.625
Yes. you are in magnificent condition.

344
00:16:20.708 --> 00:16:26.625
[laughing]

345
00:16:26.708 --> 00:16:28.208

-[Red Skull] Stop!
-[all screaming]

347

[hawk cries]

348
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.666
[Iron Man] Old West ghost town. Charming.
Didn't know these were still around.

349
00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:45.166
All right. guys. When we get
to Red She-Hulk. let me do the talking.

350
00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:48.416
Before today. I did not know
there were other Hulks out there.

351
00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.083
Are you close to Red She-Hulk?

352
00:16:50.166 --> 00:16:51.791
She's my ex-girlfriend.

353
00:16:51.875 --> 00:16:54.333
Sorry. She's your ex?

354
00:16:54.416 --> 00:16:55.916
No. no. no. It's fine.

355
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.083
Betty and I ended things on good terms.

356
00:16:58.166 --> 00:17:01.458
-[grunts]
-[Iron Man] That good. huh?

357
00:17:01.541 --> 00:17:03.791
Uh. looks like you missed me. Betts.
[chuckles]

358
00:17:03.875 --> 00:17:06.333
Maybe next time I won't. Bruce.

359
00:17:06.416 --> 00:17:07.750
What are you doing here?

360
00:17:07.833 --> 00:17:09.791
Well. um. uh--

361
00:17:09.875 --> 00:17:12.208
Well. the thing is--
[stammers] You look great. by the way.

362
00:17:12.291 --> 00:17:14.416
Uh. that-- Um. well…

363
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.458
[sighs]
You're starting to make me angry. Bruce.

364
00:17:17.541 --> 00:17:19.041
Spit it out. [grunts]

365
00:17:22.791 --> 00:17:27.500
Whatever. I'm on demo duty for my dad.
so I'm gonna get back to smashing.

366
00:17:28.875 --> 00:17:30.041
I'll go talk to her.

367
00:17:30.875 --> 00:17:32.791
Do you want me to go with you?

368
00:17:32.875 --> 00:17:34.916
-No.
-Ah. that's probably a good idea.

369
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.125
Betty. people with the word "red"
in their name are disappearing.

370
00:17:38.208 --> 00:17:39.458
Possibly being taken.

371
00:17:39.541 --> 00:17:41.000
What's that got to do with me?

372
00:17:41.083 --> 00:17:42.750
Red She-Hulk?

373
00:17:42.833 --> 00:17:44.375
-Red?
-Yeah?

374
00:17:44.458 --> 00:17:47.166
Well. nobody's disappearing me.

375
00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:49.916
My dad is one of the ones missing.

376
00:17:55.041 --> 00:17:56.166
Red Guardian.

377
00:17:56.666 --> 00:17:59.833
He and I got into this big argument.
and I blew up at him.

378
00:17:59.916 --> 00:18:02.791
I'm going to find him. but-- [sighs]

379
00:18:02.875 --> 00:18:05.166
Honestly. I'm still a little mad at him.

380
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:08.958
Look. it's not always easy to talk
to your old man.

381
00:18:09.041 --> 00:18:10.750
My dad can be a real hothead.

382
00:18:11.291 --> 00:18:13.916
Always trying to boss me around.
Telling me what to do.

383
00:18:14.583 --> 00:18:15.875
No. my dad's different.

384
00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:20.375
He's-- [stammers] He's supportive
and positive and always around.

385
00:18:20.875 --> 00:18:22.750
Then what's the problem?

386
00:18:22.833 --> 00:18:25.958
Problem is he treats me
like a little girl.

387
00:18:26.041 --> 00:18:28.958
I'm not a kid anymore.
and I don't think my dad can accept that.

388
00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:31.916
Listen. you're not perfect.
Neither is your dad.

389
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.833
You have to accept that he's human.

390
00:18:33.916 --> 00:18:35.916
So what if he still sees you as a kid?

391
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.916
Why does that bother you so much?

392
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.291
[whooshing]

393
00:18:44.916 --> 00:18:46.208
Are these with you?

394
00:18:46.708 --> 00:18:48.458
-No.
-[chuckles] Good.

395
00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:50.625
Those would be mine.

396
00:18:50.708 --> 00:18:52.666
Sorry they aren't in the best of shape.

397
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:55.541
[scoffs]
Too scuffed up to be collectibles.

398
00:18:55.625 --> 00:18:58.458
But they can do my dirty work.

399
00:18:58.541 --> 00:19:00.708
[laughs. sighs]

400
00:19:00.791 --> 00:19:03.875
What a magnificent hue.

401
00:19:04.666 --> 00:19:07.291
You're the one responsible. Who are you?

402
00:19:07.375 --> 00:19:09.125
And what did you do with my dad?

403
00:19:09.208 --> 00:19:15.958
Oh. I'm just an extraordinary fellow
who has it all. and it's still not enough.

404
00:19:16.583 --> 00:19:18.750
I'm the Collector.

405
00:19:19.416 --> 00:19:23.333
As for the other question.
Red Guardian is now part

406
00:19:23.416 --> 00:19:28.750
of the most magnificent collection
in the known universe.

407
00:19:28.833 --> 00:19:30.416
I want him back. Now.

408
00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.791
[grunts. shouts]

409
00:19:33.416 --> 00:19:34.625
[grunts]

410
00:19:35.666 --> 00:19:37.458
I love the anger.

411
00:19:37.541 --> 00:19:39.291
That is so mint.

412
00:19:39.375 --> 00:19:43.041
Don't damage the red one.
but the rest? Take 'em apart!

413
00:19:44.875 --> 00:19:46.666
-[both grunt]
-[Hulk grunts]

414
00:19:53.125 --> 00:19:54.250
All righty then.

415
00:19:54.333 --> 00:19:56.583
I'll crank up the juice
and bring the pain.

416
00:19:56.666 --> 00:19:57.875
[weapons hum]

417
00:20:00.208 --> 00:20:02.500
[grunts] Ow.

418
00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:06.666
Keep it busy.

419
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.250
I'm gonna try something.

420
00:20:09.291 --> 00:20:12.625
[grunting. sighs]

421
00:20:12.708 --> 00:20:13.833
That all you've got?

422
00:20:13.916 --> 00:20:16.916
I've fought grandmas
with tougher stuff than you.

423
00:20:18.125 --> 00:20:19.333
[grunts]

424
00:20:20.416 --> 00:20:21.750
[grunts. shouts]

425
00:20:25.583 --> 00:20:26.583
Hey. Collector!

426
00:20:26.666 --> 00:20:28.958
Nice look. Very alt-rock.

427
00:20:29.041 --> 00:20:32.541
-How do you feel about heavy metal?
-[thunder rumbling]

428
00:20:36.166 --> 00:20:38.791
[grunts] Always fashionably late.

429
00:20:38.875 --> 00:20:41.416
[grunting]

430
00:20:42.958 --> 00:20:44.291
[grunts]

431
00:20:44.375 --> 00:20:47.666
I'm gonna smash your ugly face.
Then your ugly face!

432
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:50.666
And then-- Yikes. there are a lot of you.

433
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.708
[straining]

434
00:20:54.125 --> 00:20:55.250
Don't worry. Betts!

435
00:20:55.333 --> 00:20:56.916
I got ya-- [shouts]

436
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.250
[bricks clattering]

437
00:20:58.333 --> 00:20:59.791
[sighs] Typical.

438
00:20:59.875 --> 00:21:00.958
[grunts]

439
00:21:01.458 --> 00:21:02.625
[laughs]

440
00:21:03.208 --> 00:21:04.208
We need a plan.

441
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:08.833
Thor. call a lightning strike.
aimed at this exact location.

442
00:21:08.916 --> 00:21:10.708
But lightning? Right here?

443
00:21:10.791 --> 00:21:12.541
Won't that vaporize us?

444
00:21:12.625 --> 00:21:14.583
I mean. not me. I'd obviously be fine.

445
00:21:14.666 --> 00:21:16.166
But the rest of you?

446
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.458
-Now. Thor!
-[grunts]

447
00:21:27.333 --> 00:21:29.125
[chuckles]

448
00:21:29.208 --> 00:21:30.250
Nice.

449
00:21:30.333 --> 00:21:31.333
[grunts]

450
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:34.500
Wait. They're gone?

451
00:21:35.083 --> 00:21:38.083
And so is my only chance
at finding my dad.

452
00:21:42.041 --> 00:21:43.500
[beeps]

453
00:21:43.583 --> 00:21:45.791
No sign of the Collector
on any of our scanners.

454
00:21:45.875 --> 00:21:48.291
And nothing
on the Wakandan channels as well.

455
00:21:48.375 --> 00:21:49.791
Anyone have any ideas?

456
00:21:49.875 --> 00:21:52.875
To find him.
we need someone with special skills.

457
00:21:53.625 --> 00:21:54.625
A tracker.

458
00:21:54.708 --> 00:21:56.625
Steve and I worked with him a while back.

459
00:21:56.708 --> 00:21:59.000
Yep. S.H.I.E.L.D. file 268.

460
00:21:59.083 --> 00:22:00.333
He can find anyone.

461
00:22:00.416 --> 00:22:02.500
Oh. no! No. no. no. no. no.

462
00:22:02.583 --> 00:22:05.541
No. not that guy. Anyone but that guy.

463
00:22:05.625 --> 00:22:07.083
He's the best at what he does.

464
00:22:07.166 --> 00:22:09.666
And what he does isn't very nice.

465
00:22:13.416 --> 00:22:15.666
-[sizzling]
-[snikt]

466
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:16.750
[Black Widow] Wolverine.

467
00:22:18.666 --> 00:22:22.125
[groans]
Guess I'm not gonna get to eat my lunch.

468
00:22:26.625 --> 00:22:28.000
[sniffs. groans]

469
00:22:28.083 --> 00:22:29.166
Stay on this heading.

470
00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:33.041
You can track the Collector
from this high up. at this distance?

471
00:22:33.125 --> 00:22:34.875
My nose doesn't lie.

472
00:22:34.958 --> 00:22:39.541
Collector might be untraceable.
but Red She-Hulk leaves a scent.

473
00:22:39.625 --> 00:22:41.958
I can smell a Hulk from a mile away.

474
00:22:42.041 --> 00:22:43.750
-[growls]
-What?

475
00:22:43.833 --> 00:22:47.416
Maybe try smashing
a deodorant factory once in a while.

476
00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:51.041
[sniffs] Take us down here. This is it.

477
00:23:00.791 --> 00:23:01.791
[sniffs]

478
00:23:02.375 --> 00:23:03.375
Over here.

479
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:08.500
[sniffs]

480
00:23:08.583 --> 00:23:10.250
Do you have a lock on my dad?

481
00:23:10.333 --> 00:23:13.041
[sniffs] Picking up multiple scents.

482
00:23:13.125 --> 00:23:14.333
Red She-Hulk and--

483
00:23:14.416 --> 00:23:16.166
[sniffs] Wait a second--

484
00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:18.000
[sniffs] Red Skull?

485
00:23:18.083 --> 00:23:21.833
The plan is to free everyone
from the Collector. Everyone.

486
00:23:21.916 --> 00:23:24.875
You didn't say anything
about saving villains.

487
00:23:24.958 --> 00:23:29.791
For all I care. the Collector can keep
the Red Ghost and Red Skull and…

488
00:23:29.875 --> 00:23:31.541
[sniffs. grunts]

489
00:23:31.625 --> 00:23:32.916
Omega Red?

490
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.916
-You know him?
-[grunts]

491
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.166
Omega Red is the worst.

492
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:39.625
He just sucks the life out of you.

493
00:23:39.708 --> 00:23:41.125
Just get us to the Collector.

494
00:23:41.208 --> 00:23:43.041
[groans] Follow me.

495
00:23:45.125 --> 00:23:48.333
The place is called Mom's Diner.
That's just adorable.

496
00:23:48.416 --> 00:23:50.250
It's probably a death trap.

497
00:23:50.333 --> 00:23:52.166
Can't be worse than
where you get your hair cut.

498
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:53.250
[groans]

499
00:23:53.333 --> 00:23:55.666
-[bell dings]
-Scent ends here.

500
00:24:00.083 --> 00:24:01.083
Spread out.

501
00:24:01.166 --> 00:24:03.166
Look for a hidden door or exit.

502
00:24:19.166 --> 00:24:21.416
-Anybody want lemonade?
-[clicks]

503
00:24:26.583 --> 00:24:28.583
Collector'll be down there.

504
00:24:28.666 --> 00:24:30.083
in Mom's basement.

505
00:24:34.916 --> 00:24:36.791
[Iron Man]
Definitely doesn't look like Earth tech.

506
00:24:36.875 --> 00:24:39.458
Hmm. I don't see any way down.

507
00:24:41.291 --> 00:24:43.750
[Iron Man] That's convenient. And ominous.

508
00:24:46.666 --> 00:24:48.791
My scanners have picked up
a hidden passageway

509
00:24:48.875 --> 00:24:50.875
to a deeper sublevel beneath us.

510
00:24:50.958 --> 00:24:51.958
This way.

511
00:24:57.458 --> 00:24:58.541
I'm coming. Dad.

512
00:25:00.125 --> 00:25:02.375
There better not be any secret door.

513
00:25:02.458 --> 00:25:04.791
I hate secret doors.

514
00:25:04.875 --> 00:25:06.416
-Always where you least expe--

515
00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:09.250
[all screaming]

516
00:25:09.333 --> 00:25:11.625
[computer voice]
Potential new collectibles detected.

517
00:25:11.708 --> 00:25:14.541
Activate. clean. scan and sort functions.

518
00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.208
[all groaning]

519
00:25:18.083 --> 00:25:20.000
[computer voice] Initializing power wash.

520
00:25:20.708 --> 00:25:22.833
Did that just say power wash?

00:25:22.916 --> 00:25:23.875
[all gasp]

00:25:25.083 --> 00:25:27.416

523
00:25:29.333 --> 00:25:30.458
[Hulk stammers] Whoa.

[dryers blowing]

526
00:25:36.916 --> 00:25:39.541
Wow. this is a really nice blowout.

527
00:25:39.625 --> 00:25:41.000
Whew! Same.

528
00:25:41.083 --> 00:25:43.541
[all screaming]

529
00:25:43.625 --> 00:25:46.500

Scanning complete. Identify and sort.

530
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.291
Two armored robots
with scratches and surface damage.

-Imperfect.
-[Iron Man] Imperfect?

[computer voice]
Identify and sort. Four humans.

534
00:25:56.583 --> 00:25:58.250
Identify and sort.

535
00:25:58.333 --> 00:25:59.375
Two animals.

536
00:25:59.458 --> 00:26:01.125
[both] Excuse me?

537
00:26:01.208 --> 00:26:02.750

-[Hulk grunts]
-[groans]

540
00:26:10.916 --> 00:26:14.541
[groans] This entire room stinks like…

541
00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:16.458
[sniffs] Oh. no.

542
00:26:16.541 --> 00:26:18.166
[growling]

543
00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:19.583
Is that a…

544
00:26:19.666 --> 00:26:22.500
Wendigo! [growls]

545
00:26:23.041 --> 00:26:24.083

-[chuckles] Soft.
-[growling]

549
00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:37.458
-Like wrestling a big. fluffy pillow.
-[groans]

550
00:26:38.166 --> 00:26:40.000
-[Wendigo growls]
-Uh-oh.

551
00:26:40.083 --> 00:26:41.791
Fluffy pillow's fightin' back.

-[Wendigo growling]
-[groans]

553
00:26:46.666 --> 00:26:49.458

Okay. bub. you've taken your best shot.

559
00:27:04.416 --> 00:27:05.958
Now. it's my turn.

560
00:27:06.041 --> 00:27:08.416
[Wendigo growling]

561
00:27:09.625 --> 00:27:11.750

[both panting]

566
00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:21.750
[Hulk] Wasn't as bad as I remembered.

567
00:27:21.833 --> 00:27:23.833
-[groans]
-You did pretty good there.

568
00:27:23.916 --> 00:27:26.875
[groans] Aw. thanks. man.

569
00:27:26.958 --> 00:27:29.916
[chuckles] I think I pulled a muscle.
but--

570
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.416
[growling]

571
00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.666
[Hulk] More fluffy pillows!

572
00:27:35.166 --> 00:27:36.875
I hate fluffy pillows.

573
00:27:38.541 --> 00:27:39.791
[both screaming]

574
00:27:39.875 --> 00:27:41.500
[both groan]

575
00:27:42.416 --> 00:27:44.291
I did not see that coming.

[machinery humming]

577
00:27:47.458 --> 00:27:48.958
Where's the rest of our team?

578
00:27:49.041 --> 00:27:52.125
-And why did the Collector send us here?
-We were scanned.

579
00:27:52.208 --> 00:27:55.583
The computer said
we were scratched and damaged.

580
00:27:55.666 --> 00:27:57.541
They thought we were scrap.

581
00:27:57.625 --> 00:27:58.916
They underestimated us.

582
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.625
My scanners cannot find an exit.

583
00:28:01.708 --> 00:28:04.250
[scanner beeping]

584
00:28:06.666 --> 00:28:08.625
No exit? Not a problem.

585
00:28:08.708 --> 00:28:10.083
We're gonna build our way out.

586
00:28:10.708 --> 00:28:12.833
[all screaming. groan]

587
00:28:12.916 --> 00:28:15.208
[groans] What are these things?

588
00:28:15.291 --> 00:28:17.208
Power-inhibiting manacles.

589
00:28:17.291 --> 00:28:18.750
Uh. they jam our powers.

590
00:28:18.833 --> 00:28:21.125
These must be a newer model.

591
00:28:21.958 --> 00:28:24.791
What? Have you never been captured.
thrown in prison

592
00:28:24.875 --> 00:28:27.000
and had your powers taken away before?

593
00:28:27.916 --> 00:28:28.791
-Nope.
-Nuh-uh.

594
00:28:28.875 --> 00:28:29.958
Can't say that I have.

595
00:28:30.041 --> 00:28:31.708
Just me? Huh.

596
00:28:31.791 --> 00:28:34.416
It's happened to me more times
than I care to--

597
00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.458
Really? Like. never?

598
00:28:36.541 --> 00:28:38.291
[footsteps approaching]

599
00:28:43.833 --> 00:28:46.666
Well. we found robots.
but not our friends.

600
00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:48.000
[Collector] Friends?

601
00:28:48.083 --> 00:28:49.916
Who cares about them?

602
00:28:50.708 --> 00:28:53.500
Check out my advanced bots.

603
00:28:53.583 --> 00:28:56.583
You may have bested my old ones
in the desert.

604
00:28:56.666 --> 00:28:59.208
but these are a bit more sturdy.

605
00:29:00.083 --> 00:29:03.916
Oh. the rare treasures
you're about to see.

606
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.875
I don't care about any of this.

607
00:29:05.958 --> 00:29:07.416
I want my dad.

608
00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:08.916
I'll take you to him.

609
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.333
Maybe along the way.
you could learn some manners.

610
00:29:15.541 --> 00:29:17.500
This is the magic.

611
00:29:17.583 --> 00:29:20.416
You see.
when you get to be as big a deal as I am.

612
00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:24.541
it's all about rare. one-of-a-kind.

613
00:29:24.625 --> 00:29:27.958
never made available to the public before.

614
00:29:28.041 --> 00:29:28.916
-[all gasp]
-Whoa.

615
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.291
Behold. my collection.

616
00:29:33.375 --> 00:29:34.500
[lights clicking]

617
00:29:34.583 --> 00:29:36.166
The greatest ever.
complete. mint-condition.

618
00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:38.541
sealed
and climate-controlled acid-free Mylar.

619
00:29:40.083 --> 00:29:42.250
My good stuff is in storage.

620
00:29:42.333 --> 00:29:45.625
but this is the best
of what I've acquired here on Earth.

621
00:29:45.708 --> 00:29:49.041
[giggling]
Oh. you are going to be impressed by this.

622
00:29:50.583 --> 00:29:54.250
My mythical creatures of legend!

623
00:29:54.333 --> 00:29:55.333
Are they dead?

624
00:29:55.416 --> 00:29:57.625
[scoffs] Of course not.

625
00:29:57.708 --> 00:30:00.208
Suspended animation.

626
00:30:00.291 --> 00:30:05.791
Hibernation stasis.
in absolute mint condition.

627
00:30:08.458 --> 00:30:10.916
You kidnapped Santa Claus?

628
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.083
I knew he was real.

629
00:30:12.166 --> 00:30:14.375
Come on. come on.
I have so much more to show you.

630
00:30:14.458 --> 00:30:16.750
[groans] Hey. wait.
Don't you know who that is?

631
00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:20.125
After completing those.
I tried collecting musicians.

632
00:30:20.208 --> 00:30:22.500
but you have no idea how hard it is

633
00:30:22.583 --> 00:30:24.875
to find rock stars
in halfway-decent condition.

634
00:30:24.958 --> 00:30:26.500
So. I branched out.

635
00:30:26.583 --> 00:30:31.000
Feast your eyes on my latest and greatest.

636
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:35.833
My Red Collection!

637
00:30:36.541 --> 00:30:37.916
[Black Widow gasps]

638
00:30:39.791 --> 00:30:40.791
Dad!

639
00:30:40.875 --> 00:30:42.791
[groaning. grunting]

640
00:30:42.875 --> 00:30:43.875
Let go of me!

641
00:30:43.958 --> 00:30:46.583
The first color of the rainbow.

642
00:30:46.666 --> 00:30:48.416
Soon to be followed by others.

643
00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:51.041
Although.
it thins out between green and purple.

644
00:30:51.541 --> 00:30:53.041
Not sure why.

645
00:30:53.125 --> 00:30:55.208
Collector. you're completely mad.

646
00:30:55.291 --> 00:30:59.666
I'm super mad at you ungrateful casuals.

647
00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:03.541
You don't appreciate
the greatness in my collection.

648
00:31:04.375 --> 00:31:08.125
That's why I've decided to collect you.

649
00:31:08.208 --> 00:31:11.083
[all groaning]

650
00:31:11.166 --> 00:31:12.583
Relax.

651
00:31:12.666 --> 00:31:15.041
You'll be in a protective slab.

652
00:31:15.125 --> 00:31:17.125
Frozen in stasis.

653
00:31:17.208 --> 00:31:21.041
[grunts] Perfect forever.

654
00:31:23.583 --> 00:31:26.000
-Sam. can you fly out?
-[Sam straining]

655
00:31:26.083 --> 00:31:29.416
No can do! These inhibitors have
everything shut down.

656
00:31:30.583 --> 00:31:33.250
-[thud]
-[groans] Huh?

657
00:31:36.083 --> 00:31:38.541
You'll be part of my latest collection.

658
00:31:38.625 --> 00:31:40.750
My Avengers Collection.

659
00:31:43.125 --> 00:31:44.041
Dad.

660
00:31:44.541 --> 00:31:47.125
What about Red Guardian?
Where are you going to put him?

661
00:31:47.208 --> 00:31:49.708
He's already in my Red Collection.

662
00:31:49.791 --> 00:31:51.833
Then your collection's incomplete.

663
00:31:51.916 --> 00:31:53.708
If Red Guardian's with the Reds.

664
00:31:53.791 --> 00:31:56.583
then your Avengers Collection
will always have a hole in it.

665
00:31:56.666 --> 00:31:58.833
What? What are you talking about?

666
00:31:58.916 --> 00:32:00.916
Red Guardian is red.

667
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.416
Red Guardian is an Avenger.

668
00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:06.083
No. he can't be-- You-- [scoffs]

669
00:32:06.166 --> 00:32:07.958
But he just-- Fine. whatever.

670
00:32:08.041 --> 00:32:10.625
-I'll just put him in both sets.
-Well. you can't do that.

671
00:32:10.708 --> 00:32:12.791
He's either in one collection
or the other.

672
00:32:12.875 --> 00:32:15.625
but one of them will never be complete.

673
00:32:15.708 --> 00:32:18.291
No! I have to file him under something!

674
00:32:18.375 --> 00:32:22.875
Do you have any idea how many spreadsheets
I have to keep track of all this?

675
00:32:24.375 --> 00:32:26.625
[rumbling]

676
00:32:26.708 --> 00:32:28.458
Wait. that's not the machine.

677
00:32:31.625 --> 00:32:33.333
Nobody puts us in the trash.

678
00:32:34.958 --> 00:32:37.583
-[shouts]
-At worst. we belong in recycling.

679
00:32:39.416 --> 00:32:40.833
Told you they were here.

680
00:32:40.916 --> 00:32:42.916
The nose never lies.

681
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.875
-What happened?
-[spits]

682
00:32:44.958 --> 00:32:48.208
I don't wanna talk about it. [grunting]

[groans]

685
00:32:56.875 --> 00:32:59.458
I think it's time to collect
a little payback.

686
00:33:00.875 --> 00:33:03.500
-[all grunting]
-Strike!

687
00:33:23.208 --> 00:33:24.416
Do your thing. Wolverine.

688
00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.083
[grunting]

689
00:33:27.166 --> 00:33:29.458
[groans] Where are we?

690
00:33:29.541 --> 00:33:32.708
Okay. you're inside the lair of an alien
who-- No. you know what?

691
00:33:32.791 --> 00:33:35.791
Someone will explain later.
Right now. we just need you to smash.

692
00:33:35.875 --> 00:33:36.833
I can manage that.

693
00:33:38.125 --> 00:33:40.250
Oh. and Santa is real!

694
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.583
Santa's real. everybody.

695
00:33:45.125 --> 00:33:46.416
[gasps] Dad.

700
00:34:04.875 --> 00:34:05.708
Uh-oh.

701
00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:11.291
[roars]

702
00:34:13.166 --> 00:34:14.916
And that's how it's done.

703
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.125
You miss me. Betts?

704
00:34:16.208 --> 00:34:19.000
[giggles] Maybe. Just a little.

705
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.625
Rescuing you feels wrong.

706
00:34:24.708 --> 00:34:26.666
Omega Red?

707
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:29.041
Forget it. [groans]

708
00:34:29.125 --> 00:34:32.250
You're gonna try to convince me
this is the right thing to do.

709
00:34:32.333 --> 00:34:34.666
I don't have to. You already know it.

710
00:34:37.125 --> 00:34:38.125

Wait till I tell Sabretooth.
Deathstrike and Cyber. huh?

715
00:34:51.375 --> 00:34:53.375
They're never going to believe it.

716
00:34:53.458 --> 00:34:57.333
Old Wolvie has a heart after all.
am I right?

717
00:34:57.416 --> 00:35:01.125
[giggles] We should take a picture
to commemorate this.

Hey. does anyone have a phone
we can borrow

719

[groans] Wish I had time
to do an unboxing video.

725
00:35:20.333 --> 00:35:23.708

before they ruin everything!

No! I can rescue you.

[pants] Why-- Why won't you trust me?

742
00:36:11.333 --> 00:36:13.375
Of course I trust you.

743

But I'm your papa.
It's my job to protect you.

744

And I'm scared for you.

I'm scared too.

746
00:36:21.083 --> 00:36:24.166
Papa. I think you liked me better
when I was little.

747
00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:25.791
but I'm not a kid anymore.

748
00:36:25.875 --> 00:36:28.833
And I'm scared you don't love me
for who I am now.

749
00:36:28.916 --> 00:36:32.125
Natasha. I could never stop loving you.

I know I hover around like a helicopter.
but I can't help it.

You're so grown up.
and you don't need me anymore.

Remember when you were little?

756

You and I used to make pancakes together.

We still can.

But. Papa. you need to let go.

You want me to let go?

No! No. no.
