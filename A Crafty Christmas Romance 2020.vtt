00:00:43.782 --> 00:00:45.045
Oh those are amazing. I love it!

4
00:00:45.132 --> 00:00:53.227
Thanks!

5
00:00:53.314 --> 00:00:56.186
Mandy. someone left a box for
the donation drive out back.

6
00:00:56.273 --> 00:00:57.274
Perfect.

7
00:00:57.361 --> 00:00:58.101
Someone also left a
whole bunch of trash

8
00:00:58.188 --> 00:01:00.060
next to the dumpster.

9
00:01:00.147 --> 00:01:02.192
-Do you want a hand?
-I got it.

10
00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:06.196
-You sure. Gabby?
-Yep. people. a
few inches further

11
00:01:06.283 --> 00:01:11.288
and the trash is where
it's supposed to go.

12
00:01:11.332 --> 00:01:17.947
Huh.

13
00:01:18.034 --> 00:01:19.383
A hymn book?

14
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.169
Yeah. there's a lot of used
books and toys in here too.

15
00:01:22.212 --> 00:01:24.997
I thought we were only
taking new things.

16
00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:27.087
Whoever left this
must not have known.

17
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.048
It's okay. I'll take care of it.

18
00:01:32.135 --> 00:01:35.225
Oh. wow. look at this.
"A Christmas Carol."

19
00:01:35.312 --> 00:01:37.009
Cool.

20
00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:39.055
It's a classic.

21
00:01:39.142 --> 00:01:41.101
Oh. and it's an
early edition too.

22
00:01:41.144 --> 00:01:43.538
A child still isn't
gonna want it.

23
00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:47.324
I know. but. oh.

24
00:01:47.368 --> 00:01:48.325
What's that?

25
00:01:48.412 --> 00:01:53.156
I don't know.

26
00:01:53.243 --> 00:01:58.814
Oh!

27
00:01:58.901 --> 00:01:59.597
Whoa!

28
00:01:59.684 --> 00:02:03.819
A coin!

would love it. love. Judith."

That's...

00:02:37.766 --> 00:02:39.550
Oh. look. she even
put the date on it.

December 11th. 1947.

42
00:02:43.467 --> 00:02:45.121
Oh. so long ago!

43
00:02:45.208 --> 00:02:47.079
Why is this here?

44
00:02:47.123 --> 00:02:50.518
It's sweet. who'd
wanna give it away?

45
00:02:50.605 --> 00:02:53.999
I know. maybe they didn't
know it was with this stuff.

46
00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:44.746
Judith. who are you?

47
00:03:44.833 --> 00:03:55.931
Creek Hill Chapel.

Hello. excuse me?

49
00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:27.789
Um. hello?

50
00:04:27.876 --> 00:04:29.486
Hey!

♪ A special time of year

52
00:04:32.576 --> 00:04:36.624
Ah. all right. then.

53
00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:37.625
Oh!

54
00:04:37.668 --> 00:04:39.670
Oh.

55
00:04:39.757 --> 00:04:41.106
Sorry!

56
00:04:41.193 --> 00:04:42.325
It's okay.

57
00:04:42.412 --> 00:04:44.109
Are you all right. I
didn't mean to scare you.

58
00:04:44.153 --> 00:04:45.676
Yeah. no. you didn't scare me.

59
00:04:45.763 --> 00:04:49.332
A little startled. but let's
not tell anybody about that.

60
00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:50.464
You got it.

61
00:04:50.551 --> 00:04:54.163
All right. let me
get this. oh. oh.

62
00:04:54.206 --> 00:04:55.338
Thank you.

63
00:04:55.425 --> 00:04:56.731
Sorry. I think I'm
making it worse.

64
00:04:56.818 --> 00:04:57.558
Oh well.

65
00:04:57.645 --> 00:04:58.341
Sorry.

66
00:04:58.428 --> 00:05:01.562
It's okay. better?

67
00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:05.479
Yeah. yeah. I mean. it was
good before. but. um...

68
00:05:05.566 --> 00:05:08.308
Got it.

69
00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:10.222
So you here to see the pastor?

70
00:05:10.266 --> 00:05:14.226
Yes. I am looking to track
down who donated these books.

71
00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:16.968
Oh. I did. I took
'em to a drop-off

72
00:05:17.055 --> 00:05:18.187
in town for a book drive.

73
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:19.406
That's my place. I'm Mandy.

74
00:05:19.493 --> 00:05:24.411
Oh. hey. Jonah.
nice to meet you.

75
00:05:25.716 --> 00:05:26.891
So are these your books then?

76
00:05:26.978 --> 00:05:30.808
No. I found 'em in a back
room with some odds and ends

77
00:05:30.895 --> 00:05:33.245
the pastor asked me to throw
away. but I don't know.

78
00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:34.290
those books and a
few other things

79
00:05:34.377 --> 00:05:37.946
just seemed like they
were worth saving.

80
00:05:38.033 --> 00:05:39.861
Especially if someone
else might like 'em.

81
00:05:39.948 --> 00:05:42.298
I don't suppose you happen
to know who this book

82
00:05:42.385 --> 00:05:45.606
in particular
belonged to. do you?

83
00:05:45.693 --> 00:05:50.088
No. why?

84
00:05:50.132 --> 00:05:54.441
This letter was inside
the book and a coin too.

85
00:05:54.528 --> 00:05:56.704
I wanted to find the
person who wrote it.

86
00:05:56.747 --> 00:05:57.400
Wow.

87
00:05:57.444 --> 00:06:00.011
It's amazing. isn't it?

88
00:06:00.098 --> 00:06:02.579
Yeah. that's pretty neat.

89
00:06:02.666 --> 00:06:05.539
Judith. judging by
the date. she'd be--

90
00:06:05.626 --> 00:06:09.369
In her late 70s. probably.

91
00:06:09.456 --> 00:06:12.981
You don't by chance know
who that is. do you?

92
00:06:13.068 --> 00:06:14.417
Are you from around here?

93
00:06:14.504 --> 00:06:19.901
Oh. I am. but a woman
named Judith in her 70s?

94
00:06:19.988 --> 00:06:22.120
Sorry. kinda thin to go on.

95
00:06:22.207 --> 00:06:25.210
I know. someone else probably
would've thrown this out.

96
00:06:25.297 --> 00:06:29.911
but there's something
special about it. you know?

97
00:06:29.998 --> 00:06:33.131
Yeah. I mean. any kid's
letter to Santa is.

98
00:06:33.218 --> 00:06:42.097
And this one. it being as
old as it is. I get it.

99
00:06:42.184 --> 00:06:45.753
Anyway. I was hoping maybe
it came from someone here.

100
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.971
Well. you know. the pastor
probably knows more.

101
00:06:47.015 --> 00:06:49.626
but he's not here right
now. but I can talk to him.

102
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:50.366
Would you?

103
00:06:50.453 --> 00:06:51.498
Yeah.

104
00:06:51.585 --> 00:06:54.414
That would be great.
or I can come back.

105
00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:56.459
Or you can leave a way
to get ahold of you

106
00:06:56.546 --> 00:06:58.853
and I can talk to him
or have him call you.

107
00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.638
Thank you. you
said Jonah. right?

108
00:07:01.725 --> 00:07:04.902
Yeah. Canton Construction
& Renovations.

109
00:07:04.946 --> 00:07:07.644
Okay. thanks.

110
00:07:07.688 --> 00:07:09.385
and sorry to have
interrupted your work.

111
00:07:09.472 --> 00:07:14.303
Oh. not a problem at all.

112
00:07:14.346 --> 00:07:19.439
Bye then. and thanks again.

113
00:07:19.526 --> 00:07:22.398
Yeah. no problem.

114
00:07:42.374 --> 00:07:43.898
You done for the night?

115
00:07:43.985 --> 00:07:45.769
Yeah. just powering down.

116
00:07:45.856 --> 00:07:46.509
We'll pick up where
we left off tomorrow.

117
00:07:46.553 --> 00:07:50.165
Excellent.

118
00:07:50.252 --> 00:07:52.297
So what do you think.
we still on schedule?

119
00:07:52.384 --> 00:07:53.473
Yeah. I think so.

120
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.996
We'll let you know if
we hit any hiccups.

121
00:07:55.039 --> 00:07:56.127
All right.

122
00:07:56.171 --> 00:07:58.739
Yeah. hey. a woman
came by this morning.

123
00:07:58.826 --> 00:08:00.871
asking about the books we
found in the back room.

124
00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.003
Ah.
She said she found

125
00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:03.004
something interesting
in one of them

126
00:08:03.091 --> 00:08:04.484
and was trying to
track down the owner.

127
00:08:04.527 --> 00:08:06.834
I wish I knew.
everything in there

128
00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:08.662
has accumulated over the years.

129
00:08:08.705 --> 00:08:11.186
long before I was pastor here.

130
00:08:11.273 --> 00:08:13.014
How 'bout a woman named Judith?

131
00:08:13.057 --> 00:08:13.797
She'd be much older now.

132
00:08:13.884 --> 00:08:17.279
Well. there's a Judith Tucker.

133
00:08:17.366 --> 00:08:18.541
but she's only in her 50s. so...

134
00:08:18.585 --> 00:08:22.327
Hmm. anybody else?

135
00:08:22.414 --> 00:08:23.503
No one that comes to mind.

136
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:27.202
I'm sure Pastor O'Brien
would have known more.

137
00:08:27.289 --> 00:08:29.204
Are there church records
that go back that far?

138
00:08:29.291 --> 00:08:32.033
Well. I'm afraid I had
to throw a lot them out.

139
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.601
they were damaged from a
burst pipe a few winters ago.

140
00:08:34.644 --> 00:08:37.691
The only thing that's left
is the more recent ones.

141
00:08:37.778 --> 00:08:39.736
This woman. is she
a friend of yours?

142
00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.869
We just met.

143
00:08:41.956 --> 00:08:44.567
Oh. thought she
might've been a--

144
00:08:44.654 --> 00:08:46.656
What?

145
00:08:46.743 --> 00:08:50.530
Well. you seem very
determined to help her.

146
00:08:50.617 --> 00:08:53.402
Well. it's not quite like that.

147
00:08:53.489 --> 00:08:58.538
Oh. okay.

148
00:08:58.581 --> 00:09:01.584
She must be a very special lady.

149
00:09:01.628 --> 00:09:04.065
Good night. Pastor.

150
00:09:08.722 --> 00:09:15.119
This turned out so great.
you are quite the artist!

151
00:09:15.163 --> 00:09:16.033
Have a merry Christmas.

152
00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.035

♪ A merry Christmas ♪

154
00:09:21.909 --> 00:09:23.606
I wonder if this
is worth anything.

155
00:09:23.693 --> 00:09:26.566
Well. if it is. maybe you
shouldn't handle it like that.

156
00:09:26.653 --> 00:09:28.829
Seriously though.
you should find out.

157
00:09:28.872 --> 00:09:30.570
Andre has his rare book
store around the corner.

158
00:09:30.657 --> 00:09:32.876
He'd know something.

159
00:09:32.963 --> 00:09:33.964
Doesn't matter though.

160
00:09:34.008 --> 00:09:35.575
I wanna return it to
the letter writer.

161
00:09:35.662 --> 00:09:37.185
It might matter to Judith

162
00:09:37.272 --> 00:09:39.143
if you ever find her.
which is a big if.

163
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:40.449
I know.

164
00:09:40.536 --> 00:09:41.581
What if she's passed away?

165
00:09:41.668 --> 00:09:44.888
I mean. decades
have gone by. so...

166
00:09:44.975 --> 00:09:48.109
I get it. the deck is
stacked against me.

167
00:09:48.152 --> 00:09:53.027
but I still wanna try.

168
00:09:53.114 --> 00:09:55.856
Hmm. well. I'm no expert.

169
00:09:55.943 --> 00:09:57.684
but I do dabble in
coins here and there.

170
00:09:57.771 --> 00:09:59.468
You know. the hardest thing

171
00:09:59.555 --> 00:10:00.861
is when some young
fella comes in

172
00:10:00.948 --> 00:10:02.471
with his great-uncle's
collection.

173
00:10:02.558 --> 00:10:04.865
certain he's about
to strike it rich.

174
00:10:04.908 --> 00:10:08.956
Well. I was just curious to
know what I've been holding.

175
00:10:09.043 --> 00:10:11.611
Hmm. well. not to get
your hopes up. but...

176
00:10:14.788 --> 00:10:15.832
What?

177
00:10:15.876 --> 00:10:19.749
It's 1895.

178
00:10:19.836 --> 00:10:23.797
This is a proof coin.

179
00:10:23.884 --> 00:10:26.974
This coin in mint condition

180
00:10:27.017 --> 00:10:31.892
could be worth $30.000 easily.

181
00:10:31.979 --> 00:10:37.375
It's a bit worn. but still.
you've got quite a coin here.

182
00:10:37.462 --> 00:10:39.856
$30.000. really?

183
00:10:39.943 --> 00:10:41.510
Now. I said could be.

184
00:10:41.597 --> 00:10:44.252
and that's if it were in perfect
condition. no guarantees.

185
00:10:44.339 --> 00:10:47.516
Of course. thanks. Andre.

186
00:10:47.603 --> 00:10:51.346
Yeah. look. if you
decide to sell this.

187
00:10:51.433 --> 00:10:52.129
I hope you'll let me bid on it.

188
00:10:52.216 --> 00:10:56.481
You bet. but not mine to sell.

189
00:10:56.525 --> 00:10:58.092
Thanks again.

190
00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:00.616
You've won the lottery!

191
00:11:00.703 --> 00:11:01.965
No. Judith has.

192
00:11:02.052 --> 00:11:04.838
Okay. but think about it.
after you've done everything

193
00:11:04.881 --> 00:11:05.708
you can and you can't find her--

194
00:11:05.795 --> 00:11:07.188
Hey. don't jinx this!

195
00:11:07.275 --> 00:11:10.017
Or she's passed away or
is somehow unreachable.

196
00:11:10.104 --> 00:11:11.758
what will you do?

197
00:11:11.845 --> 00:11:14.804
I'll find her or her family.

198
00:11:14.891 --> 00:11:17.894
They deserve to have
the coin and the letter.

199
00:11:17.981 --> 00:11:20.418
Oh. wouldn't this make the best
Christmas present for them?

200
00:11:20.462 --> 00:11:23.770
Sure. Christmas is a
couple weeks away. though.

201
00:11:23.857 --> 00:11:26.120
Plenty of time.

202
00:11:26.207 --> 00:11:33.693
Oh. boy.

203
00:11:35.172 --> 00:11:36.739
Any luck?

204
00:11:36.783 --> 00:11:40.395
There are a lot of Judiths.
even just around here.

205
00:11:40.482 --> 00:11:42.049
I didn't think it was
that common of a name.

206
00:11:42.136 --> 00:11:45.487
Too bad it's not Gabby.
there aren't too many of us.

207
00:11:45.574 --> 00:11:50.753
True.

208
00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.190
Did you just type in Judith
and think you'd find her?

209
00:11:53.277 --> 00:11:55.758
I typed in the name
of towns around here.

210
00:11:55.845 --> 00:11:58.848
Everett. Kingston. you know.

211
00:11:58.935 --> 00:12:00.458
Hey. it's just a start.

212
00:12:00.545 --> 00:12:03.984
I'll say. anything else you
need done around here tonight?

213
00:12:04.071 --> 00:12:06.160
Uh. no. thanks. Gabby.

214
00:12:06.247 --> 00:12:07.248
All right. I'll take off then.

215
00:12:07.291 --> 00:12:09.032
Okay. good night.

216
00:12:34.057 --> 00:12:36.103
Sorry. we're closed.

217
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:37.887
Hi. Mandy.

218
00:12:37.974 --> 00:12:40.977
Oh. Jonah. sorry. I thought
you were a customer.

219
00:12:41.064 --> 00:12:44.415
It's okay. I talked
to the pastor.

220
00:12:44.502 --> 00:12:46.504
You did. what did he say?

221
00:12:46.548 --> 00:12:48.202
He doesn't know who
it could belong to.

222
00:12:48.289 --> 00:12:53.990
Oh. okay. well thank you
for asking him though.

223
00:12:54.034 --> 00:12:56.210
Did you come all this
way just for that?

224
00:12:56.297 --> 00:12:59.691
No. I was in the area
buying supplies for a job.

225
00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:00.649
Oh.

226
00:13:00.736 --> 00:13:05.785
But I had an idea.

227
00:13:08.309 --> 00:13:10.964
I wanna help you find Judith.

228
00:13:11.051 --> 00:13:12.313
You do?

229
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.446
Yeah. you know. I spent
most of my life in Everett.

230
00:13:15.533 --> 00:13:17.231
and assuming Judith
is from there

231
00:13:17.318 --> 00:13:21.235
or around there. let's team up.

232
00:13:21.322 --> 00:13:23.106
Well. I wanna find
her by Christmas.

233
00:13:23.193 --> 00:13:26.109
so I could use all
the help I can get.

234
00:13:26.196 --> 00:13:28.720
But are you sure?

235
00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:30.331
Yeah. why not?

236
00:13:30.418 --> 00:13:33.551
Well. you have your renovations
and your work to do.

237
00:13:33.638 --> 00:13:35.205
You know. a lot of that
can go on without me.

238
00:13:35.292 --> 00:13:38.861
I've got subcontractors
and others

239
00:13:38.948 --> 00:13:40.210
who really do a lot of the work.

240
00:13:40.297 --> 00:13:45.128
But why do you wanna
spend your time with this?

241
00:13:45.215 --> 00:13:49.829
I don't know. it's
intriguing and kinda noble.

242
00:13:51.004 --> 00:13:55.008
And you seem like
somebody worth helping.

243
00:13:55.095 --> 00:13:57.837
Thanks.

244
00:13:57.924 --> 00:14:00.970
Plus. I know where
we can get started.

245
00:14:01.057 --> 00:14:03.755
Where?

246
00:14:03.799 --> 00:14:05.148
The letter mentioned
that her father died

247
00:14:05.235 --> 00:14:06.976
in the war. World War II.

248
00:14:07.063 --> 00:14:08.804
So you're hoping we could find

249
00:14:08.891 --> 00:14:11.111
a list of those who served
from the Everett area.

250
00:14:11.198 --> 00:14:12.286
Exactly.

251
00:14:12.373 --> 00:14:17.769
Okay.

252
00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:19.075
What do y'all need?

253
00:14:19.119 --> 00:14:22.209
Hi. we're trying to
track down soldiers

254
00:14:22.296 --> 00:14:24.994
who died in World War II
who lived in the county.

255
00:14:25.081 --> 00:14:27.040
Is that something you
might have record of.

256
00:14:27.083 --> 00:14:28.128
Name?

257
00:14:28.215 --> 00:14:31.131
Um. yeah. we don't have that.

258
00:14:31.218 --> 00:14:35.135
Sorry.

259
00:14:35.222 --> 00:14:38.094
Give me a few minutes.

260
00:14:38.138 --> 00:14:39.313
She thinks we're crazy.

261
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.664
Yeah. could be worse.

262
00:14:42.751 --> 00:14:46.363
Thanks for this.
you know. helping.

263
00:14:46.407 --> 00:14:47.669
I'm happy I can.

264
00:14:47.756 --> 00:14:50.193
I'm taking you away
from your building!

265
00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:51.325
Or renovating?

266
00:14:51.412 --> 00:14:54.632
Let's just call it construction.

267
00:14:54.719 --> 00:14:55.285
that general enough?

268
00:14:55.372 --> 00:14:56.547
Have you done that long?

269
00:14:56.634 --> 00:14:59.159
Yeah. I mean. around here
it's more fixing up things

270
00:14:59.246 --> 00:15:02.118
and building add-ons than
building new buildings.

271
00:15:02.205 --> 00:15:04.425
but every once in awhile
a big job comes up.

272
00:15:04.512 --> 00:15:07.471
Have you thought about
moving to a bigger city?

273
00:15:07.558 --> 00:15:11.780
Yeah. been there. done
that. but didn't like it.

274
00:15:11.823 --> 00:15:12.694
Well. why's that?

275
00:15:12.781 --> 00:15:15.871
Ah. it's too tense. you know?

276
00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:20.702
Everything's more expensive.
more red tape. more stress.

277
00:15:20.789 --> 00:15:22.356
Building's supposed
to be exciting.

278
00:15:22.443 --> 00:15:23.792
I started to dread it.

279
00:15:23.879 --> 00:15:25.402
So you left.

280
00:15:25.489 --> 00:15:27.622
I came back home.

281
00:15:27.709 --> 00:15:29.711
It's not as busy here.
the money's not as good.

282
00:15:29.798 --> 00:15:32.932
but I really love it here.

283
00:15:33.019 --> 00:15:35.456
Me too.

284
00:15:35.543 --> 00:15:37.414
Here it is.

285
00:15:37.501 --> 00:15:38.676
Ah. this is it?

286
00:15:38.763 --> 00:15:40.417
Yep. it's the whole county.

287
00:15:40.504 --> 00:15:41.418
you'll have to sift through it.

288
00:15:41.505 --> 00:15:44.030
Is there any way we
could check this out?

289
00:15:44.117 --> 00:15:48.034
We're not a library. but
we have a copy machine.

290
00:15:48.121 --> 00:15:50.775
Without a name there's so many.

291
00:15:50.862 --> 00:15:53.691
Well. it could be a
starting point though.

292
00:15:53.778 --> 00:15:55.258
Where is that copy machine?

293
00:16:04.702 --> 00:16:07.401
Oh. I didn't pay attention
before. but this is cool.

294
00:16:07.488 --> 00:16:10.273
You can make your own crafts?

295
00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.709
Yeah. this time of year

296
00:16:11.796 --> 00:16:13.929
it's all about decorating
things for Christmas.

297
00:16:14.016 --> 00:16:16.410
But the store stays busy all
year round with date nights.

298
00:16:16.497 --> 00:16:19.195
other holidays. birthday
parties. and such.

299
00:16:19.282 --> 00:16:23.504
So creative and
cute. can I say that?

300
00:16:23.591 --> 00:16:25.027
Of course.

301
00:16:25.114 --> 00:16:27.116
Hey. we had a few more
toy donations come in.

302
00:16:27.203 --> 00:16:28.074
Perfect.

303
00:16:28.161 --> 00:16:29.336
Who's this?

304
00:16:29.423 --> 00:16:31.991
Oh. Gabby. this is Jonah.
he's helping with the--

305
00:16:32.078 --> 00:16:34.558
Mystery letter writer
search. welcome.

306
00:16:34.645 --> 00:16:36.169
Thank you. nice to meet you.

307
00:16:36.256 --> 00:16:37.518
So you work here?

308
00:16:37.605 --> 00:16:40.477
Yep. I keep this place running
while Mandy's distracted.

309
00:16:41.739 --> 00:16:43.219
Oh. sorry. it's one
of my job sites.

310
00:16:43.306 --> 00:16:44.394
Do you mind if we
pick this up tomorrow?

311
00:16:44.438 --> 00:16:46.309
I should have this
settled by then.

312
00:16:46.396 --> 00:16:47.441
Oh. sure.

313
00:16:47.528 --> 00:16:48.442
Great. there you go.

314
00:16:48.529 --> 00:16:50.096
Thank you.

315
00:16:50.183 --> 00:16:54.926
Bye!
Bye.

316
00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:55.275
He seems nice enough.

317
00:16:55.362 --> 00:16:58.278
Yeah.

318
00:16:58.365 --> 00:16:59.235
Make any progress today?

319
00:16:59.322 --> 00:17:03.892
Yep. well. sort of.

320
00:17:03.979 --> 00:17:04.936
What's that?

321
00:17:05.024 --> 00:17:10.464
A haystack.

322
00:17:10.551 --> 00:17:13.249
We really need to get
this done right this time.

323
00:17:13.336 --> 00:17:14.816
so let's not disappoint.

324
00:17:14.903 --> 00:17:18.646
Got it. I'll get right on it.

325
00:17:18.733 --> 00:17:20.952
Looks like you're
pretty busy here.

326
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.563
You sure you have
time for this now?

327
00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:25.609
Oh yeah. it'll be nice to
take a break from this mess.

328
00:17:25.696 --> 00:17:27.611
We had some work done here that.

329
00:17:27.698 --> 00:17:30.571
how should I put it.
failed spectacularly.

330
00:17:30.658 --> 00:17:31.920
Ouch.

331
00:17:32.007 --> 00:17:34.749
Yeah. I hired someone here
who messed up pretty bad.

332
00:17:34.836 --> 00:17:36.620
We didn't find out
until we were all done

333
00:17:36.707 --> 00:17:37.752
and the business reopened.

334
00:17:37.839 --> 00:17:40.363
Now it's causing a huge
inconvenience for them

335
00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:42.974
and costing me a small fortune.

336
00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:45.325
but it'll be nice
when it's done.

337
00:17:45.412 --> 00:17:49.242
Well. I brought everything.
including two copies

338
00:17:49.285 --> 00:17:50.417
of the letter so I don't
damage the original.

339
00:17:50.504 --> 00:17:53.420
Very nice.

340
00:17:53.507 --> 00:17:54.638
You ready?

341
00:17:54.725 --> 00:17:57.163
Oh yeah. I was
thinking we'd start

342
00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:59.469
with those who died in Everett.

343
00:17:59.556 --> 00:18:02.516
Wish these were
organized better.

344
00:18:02.603 --> 00:18:05.040
Too bad computers
weren't invented earlier.

345
00:18:11.568 --> 00:18:13.962
I was crazy to think

346
00:18:14.049 --> 00:18:15.398
this would lead to something.

347
00:18:15.485 --> 00:18:18.140
Actually. it was my crazy idea.

348
00:18:18.227 --> 00:18:22.188
Oh sorry. it's like solving
for X in a math problem

349
00:18:22.275 --> 00:18:24.407
but without any other numbers.

350
00:18:24.494 --> 00:18:27.671
Judith could have
left us more clues.

351
00:18:27.758 --> 00:18:28.933
Yeah. right?

352
00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:32.154
I'm sure she thought that
while she was writing it.

353
00:18:32.241 --> 00:18:33.764
Now look at this.
there's a next of kin

354
00:18:33.851 --> 00:18:35.679
listed with each one
of these soldiers.

355
00:18:35.766 --> 00:18:37.725
What if the mother
was named Judith?

356
00:18:37.812 --> 00:18:41.685
Mm. daughters aren't named
after mothers very often.

357
00:18:41.772 --> 00:18:43.252
Or another relative.

358
00:18:43.339 --> 00:18:46.299
I'm not saying we
find a Judith Junior.

359
00:18:46.386 --> 00:18:49.128
I wonder if we cross
reference the county list

360
00:18:49.215 --> 00:18:52.218
with all the Judiths I
found. maybe. I don't know.

361
00:18:52.305 --> 00:18:53.436
maybe something connects.

362
00:18:53.523 --> 00:18:56.787
Yeah. you really wanna
type all this up?

363
00:18:56.831 --> 00:19:00.574
No. I...

364
00:19:00.661 --> 00:19:02.924
I saw something.

365
00:19:03.011 --> 00:19:04.621
What?

366
00:19:07.972 --> 00:19:08.408
Victor Franklin.

367
00:19:08.495 --> 00:19:10.671
It's his book!

368
00:19:10.758 --> 00:19:13.152
Maybe that is Judith's brother.

369
00:19:13.239 --> 00:19:17.895
Or her dad. either
way. that's a lead.

370
00:19:17.982 --> 00:19:20.071
He's gotta be here.

371
00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:21.247
If he was a soldier.

372
00:19:21.334 --> 00:19:24.032
But maybe Victor wasn't.

373
00:19:24.119 --> 00:19:26.513
Well. I am more than halfway
through. so with my luck.

374
00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:32.127
probably be on the last
page I look through.

375
00:19:32.214 --> 00:19:33.650
Nope. not on the
last page.

376
00:19:37.176 --> 00:19:39.961
Now. what if it was a brother?

377
00:19:40.048 --> 00:19:43.573
Look at his handwriting.
it's kind of young looking.

378
00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:45.488
But it could also be
the father's copy.

379
00:19:45.575 --> 00:19:51.842
The book was first
published in the 1800s.

380
00:19:51.929 --> 00:19:53.714
Not this edition.

381
00:19:53.757 --> 00:20:00.111
Hmm.

382
00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:03.898
Okay. let's say you're right.

383
00:20:03.985 --> 00:20:08.163
What do you suggest?

384
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:11.079
Victor Franklin. age 78.

385
00:20:11.166 --> 00:20:11.732
This could be him.

386
00:20:11.819 --> 00:20:13.951
What did you search?

387
00:20:14.038 --> 00:20:15.779
Property records
and a phone number.

388
00:20:15.866 --> 00:20:16.519
He lives in Everett.

389
00:20:16.606 --> 00:20:22.743
Really?

390
00:20:22.786 --> 00:20:26.007
So I'll call Victor to set
something up for tomorrow

391
00:20:26.094 --> 00:20:27.530
while Gabby's running the store.

392
00:20:27.617 --> 00:20:29.924
Gabby wasn't kidding.

393
00:20:30.011 --> 00:20:31.099
About what?

394
00:20:31.186 --> 00:20:33.188
She says she runs the
store while you're busy.

395
00:20:33.275 --> 00:20:35.843
Oh. yeah. it's a lot to
be cooped up in the store

396
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:40.021
from sunup to sundown. so I was
looking for someone to help.

397
00:20:40.108 --> 00:20:41.457
and then Gabby comes along

398
00:20:41.544 --> 00:20:44.330
knocking on my glass door
selling solar panels.

399
00:20:44.417 --> 00:20:45.418
Really?

400
00:20:45.505 --> 00:20:47.463
Yep. she had this
deadpan blunt sales pitch

401
00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:51.467
straight out of whatever
talking points she'd been given.

402
00:20:51.554 --> 00:20:52.555
Oh. it made me laugh.

403
00:20:52.642 --> 00:20:53.556
And you hired her
based off of that?

404
00:20:53.643 --> 00:20:56.603
Yeah. I appreciated her honesty.

405
00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:59.475
She will call it
like she sees it.

406
00:20:59.562 --> 00:21:00.520
and as long as she believes in

407
00:21:00.607 --> 00:21:03.131
what she's doing.
she will work hard.

408
00:21:03.218 --> 00:21:04.437
And now she works
for your store.

409
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.918
Well. my great-grandfather's
store. actually.

410
00:21:08.005 --> 00:21:09.529
It started out as a book store

411
00:21:09.572 --> 00:21:13.315
and then toys when my parents
ran it. and over time.

412
00:21:13.359 --> 00:21:15.665
I've shifted it
to do-it-yourself

413
00:21:15.752 --> 00:21:19.234
Hmm. and now it's just you
and Gabby running the place?

414
00:21:19.321 --> 00:21:21.497
Since my parents retired. yes.

415
00:21:21.584 --> 00:21:24.195
In fact. they are on
their dream vacation.

416
00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:26.023
a six-month cruise.

417
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:27.416
Wow.

418
00:21:27.503 --> 00:21:31.072
Mm-hmm. I think they still
have three months left.

419
00:21:31.159 --> 00:21:32.943
won't even be back
for Christmas.

420
00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:35.816
Oh. do you have any
brothers and sisters?

421
00:21:35.859 --> 00:21:38.906
Two brothers. but they
didn't appreciate the store.

422
00:21:38.993 --> 00:21:41.082
They live in Oregon and Nevada.

423
00:21:41.169 --> 00:21:42.562
So what do you plan
to do for Christmas

424
00:21:42.649 --> 00:21:44.781
without your family around?

425
00:21:44.868 --> 00:21:45.695
I'm still trying
to figure that out.

426
00:21:45.739 --> 00:21:50.700
I could sleep in.
go see a movie.

427
00:21:50.744 --> 00:21:55.052
open presents for
myself whenever I want.

428
00:21:55.139 --> 00:21:56.750
What about you. any big plans?

429
00:21:56.837 --> 00:22:00.014
Yeah. I'm actually
gonna host my parents.

430
00:22:00.101 --> 00:22:02.582
I think they expect me to cook.

431
00:22:02.669 --> 00:22:05.846
Okay. well. you can
always get takeout.

432
00:22:05.933 --> 00:22:08.239
Oh. for Christmas dinner?

433
00:22:08.327 --> 00:22:09.937
My mother would be horrified.

434
00:22:10.981 --> 00:22:12.113
Hey. Jonah. can you
come take a look

435
00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:12.505
at something real quick?

436
00:22:12.548 --> 00:22:14.898
Sure.

437
00:22:14.942 --> 00:22:17.031
I should let you
get back to work.

438
00:22:17.118 --> 00:22:17.814
All right.

439
00:22:17.901 --> 00:22:21.862
Bye.
See you later.

440
00:22:21.905 --> 00:22:22.863
This is Victor Franklin.

441
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:25.474
I'm sorry I can't
come to the phone now.

442
00:22:25.561 --> 00:22:26.736
but if you'll leave--

443
00:22:28.477 --> 00:22:30.044
Are you ever gonna
leave a message?

444
00:22:30.131 --> 00:22:33.700
I already did. I keep
hoping he'll pick up.

445
00:22:33.787 --> 00:22:36.920
but I don't wanna come
across as too persistent.

446
00:22:36.964 --> 00:22:39.009
Who you calling. Jonah?

447
00:22:39.096 --> 00:22:40.446
No.

448
00:22:40.533 --> 00:22:42.926
Oh. I thought you were playing
hard to get or something.

449
00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:45.625
No. he's just helping out.

450
00:22:45.668 --> 00:22:48.628
No. I was calling this
man named Victor Franklin.

451
00:22:48.715 --> 00:22:51.108
He might be the owner of
"The Christmas Carol" book.

452
00:22:51.195 --> 00:22:53.720
And he hasn't answered
or called you back?

453
00:22:53.807 --> 00:22:55.722
No.

454
00:22:55.765 --> 00:22:58.725
Here. use your phone.

455
00:22:58.812 --> 00:23:01.815
here's his number. you call.

456
00:23:01.902 --> 00:23:02.468
I'm not calling a stranger.

457
00:23:02.555 --> 00:23:04.208
Come on. just try it.

458
00:23:04.295 --> 00:23:06.385
No. if he hasn't answered.
there's probably a good reason.

459
00:23:06.472 --> 00:23:09.431
But it's important.

460
00:23:09.518 --> 00:23:12.216
Yeah. you have to find out
if he owned a book once.

461
00:23:12.303 --> 00:23:14.305
Just. come on. call!

462
00:23:14.349 --> 00:23:15.611
Am I getting extra
time off for this?

463
00:23:15.655 --> 00:23:16.351
Shh!

464
00:23:18.484 --> 00:23:19.746
Is it going through?

465
00:23:20.616 --> 00:23:21.443
This is Victor Franklin.

466
00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:22.575
Voicemail.
I'm sorry I can't come--

467
00:23:22.662 --> 00:23:24.403
See. he's not dodging
your calls after all.

468
00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:25.273
Leave your name--

469
00:23:25.316 --> 00:23:26.970
You want me to leave a message?

470
00:23:27.057 --> 00:23:31.453
Mm. no. yes. no.
no. no. no. no. no.

471
00:23:34.325 --> 00:23:37.938
Good job. now you'll
just have to wait.

472
00:23:38.025 --> 00:23:41.202
Jonah did find his address.

473
00:23:47.164 --> 00:23:47.904
Hey!

474
00:23:47.991 --> 00:23:48.775
Hi.

475
00:23:48.862 --> 00:23:51.212
Victor never called back. so...

476
00:23:51.299 --> 00:23:58.741
Well. let's see if he's home.

477
00:23:58.828 --> 00:24:09.012
All right then.

478
00:24:09.099 --> 00:24:12.494
Can I help you?

479
00:24:12.538 --> 00:24:16.367
I don't know anyone
named Judith Franklin.

480
00:24:16.411 --> 00:24:19.109
Well. I got a niece
named Judith though.

481
00:24:19.196 --> 00:24:20.502
Do you know when she was born?

482
00:24:20.589 --> 00:24:26.769
Um. 1960. I think.

483
00:24:26.856 --> 00:24:31.165
Oh. a bit young for
who we are looking for.

484
00:24:31.208 --> 00:24:33.950
Did you know any other
Judiths growing up?

485
00:24:34.037 --> 00:24:37.476
Oh. now. my memory's
not that good.

486
00:24:37.563 --> 00:24:40.000
How 'bout this book?

487
00:24:40.087 --> 00:24:41.480
Is this yours?

488
00:24:41.523 --> 00:24:50.358
Well. I don't recall.

489
00:24:50.445 --> 00:24:52.534
I never was much
of a Dickens fan.

490
00:24:52.578 --> 00:24:55.406
It has your name written in it.

491
00:24:55.494 --> 00:24:57.017
Where'd you find it?

492
00:24:57.104 --> 00:24:57.931
At an old church in town.

493
00:24:58.018 --> 00:25:00.368
We thought maybe
you left it behind

494
00:25:00.455 --> 00:25:02.109
at some point when
you were growing up.

495
00:25:02.196 --> 00:25:04.024
Oh. I don't think so.

496
00:25:04.111 --> 00:25:06.983
I was born and
raised in California.

497
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:11.553
We just moved out here
maybe four years ago.

498
00:25:11.597 --> 00:25:13.250
My wife's sister
needed some help.

499
00:25:13.294 --> 00:25:15.557
so we came on out.
uprooted ourselves.

500
00:25:15.644 --> 00:25:18.517
Sure do miss those mild
winters back there.

501
00:25:18.604 --> 00:25:25.175
I'm not fit for this
snow they got out here.

502
00:25:25.262 --> 00:25:26.655
Well. it was worth a shot.

503
00:25:26.742 --> 00:25:30.006
Jonah. did you see the
book by his glasses?

504
00:25:30.093 --> 00:25:30.920
No.

505
00:25:31.007 --> 00:25:31.660
It was a yearbook.

506
00:25:31.747 --> 00:25:33.488
Yeah. but it's not him though.

507
00:25:33.575 --> 00:25:36.578
No. but odds are there
is a Victor Franklin

508
00:25:36.622 --> 00:25:39.581
in a yearbook somewhere. right?

509
00:25:39.625 --> 00:25:41.627
And you're thinking?

510
00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:43.585
We could check the
schools around here.

511
00:25:43.629 --> 00:25:45.892
see if they have any
Victor Franklins?

512
00:25:45.979 --> 00:25:52.246
Ah. I like it. I'll pull up
the addresses for the schools.

513
00:25:57.773 --> 00:25:58.861
Hello?

514
00:25:58.905 --> 00:26:00.297
Cellphones are supposed
to be off here.

515
00:26:00.384 --> 00:26:03.213
Oh. hang on a second. sorry.

516
00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:03.866
Hi.

517
00:26:03.953 --> 00:26:06.216
Is this Jonah Canton?

518
00:26:06.303 --> 00:26:07.217
Yes.

519
00:26:07.261 --> 00:26:09.829
I'm from Taggart
Collection Agency.

520
00:26:09.916 --> 00:26:12.614
We're calling about
your overdue balances.

521
00:26:12.701 --> 00:26:14.616
Yeah.

522
00:26:14.703 --> 00:26:17.576
This school has been around
since the 1950s. right?

523
00:26:17.663 --> 00:26:20.013
Yes. 1949.

524
00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:23.407
Do you happen to have any
yearbooks from back then?

525
00:26:23.494 --> 00:26:24.974
Every one since
the school opened.

526
00:26:25.018 --> 00:26:27.760
Perfect. is there a way
I could look at those?

527
00:26:27.847 --> 00:26:28.804
Which year?

528
00:26:28.848 --> 00:26:29.588
To be safe.

529
00:26:29.675 --> 00:26:37.073
how about 1949 to 1963?

530
00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:43.253
It's for a really good cause.

531
00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:44.428
We can't extend it any further.

532
00:26:44.515 --> 00:26:45.473
Yeah. I understand.

533
00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:45.821
Okay. thank you
very much. buh-bye.

534
00:26:45.908 --> 00:26:47.649
Okay. bye.

535
00:26:57.703 --> 00:26:59.139
This might take awhile.

536
00:26:59.182 --> 00:27:01.445
Could I check these out?

537
00:27:01.532 --> 00:27:03.752
The library's only for
students and staff.

538
00:27:03.839 --> 00:27:06.886
Oh. where else can I find these?

539
00:27:06.973 --> 00:27:10.498
Well. I don't know.

540
00:27:10.541 --> 00:27:13.327
Look. I promise I will
take such good care of them

541
00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:15.634
and I will bring them back soon.

542
00:27:15.721 --> 00:27:19.681
I can ask the principal. but
she's out today and tomorrow.

543
00:27:19.768 --> 00:27:21.291
Why don't you come
back next week?

544
00:27:21.378 --> 00:27:23.729
I'm kind of under a time crunch.

545
00:27:23.772 --> 00:27:26.470
Look. it's Thursday.
how about I promise

546
00:27:26.557 --> 00:27:29.125
to bring them back
to you on Monday?

547
00:27:29.212 --> 00:27:30.213
That long?

548
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:31.562
Well. I'll work on
it over the weekend

549
00:27:31.606 --> 00:27:32.563
and then I will bring
them back to you

550
00:27:32.651 --> 00:27:39.614
first thing Monday morning.

551
00:27:39.701 --> 00:27:42.312
Let me get you a box.

552
00:27:42.399 --> 00:27:44.358
I don't want these getting
damaged or wet if it's snowing.

553
00:27:44.401 --> 00:27:45.185
Thank you!

554
00:27:58.938 --> 00:28:00.200
Hey!

555
00:28:00.287 --> 00:28:01.462
What's all that?

556
00:28:01.549 --> 00:28:03.246
Yearbooks.

557
00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:04.465
I don't think those
will be sought after

558
00:28:04.552 --> 00:28:05.640
from the donation bin.

559
00:28:05.727 --> 00:28:07.990
Oh. we are tracking
down Judith and Victor.

560
00:28:08.077 --> 00:28:09.339
That's a lot of yearbooks.

561
00:28:09.426 --> 00:28:10.776
Three high schools'
worth. Everett. Kingston.

562
00:28:10.863 --> 00:28:12.995
we even drove to Midwell.

563
00:28:13.082 --> 00:28:14.910
And they all want them
back early next week

564
00:28:14.997 --> 00:28:16.782
before school closes
for Christmas.

565
00:28:16.869 --> 00:28:18.392
Sounds like a new haystack.

566
00:28:18.479 --> 00:28:19.436
Oh yeah.

567
00:28:19.523 --> 00:28:20.220
Well. let me take some home.

568
00:28:20.263 --> 00:28:21.177
We can divide 'em up.

569
00:28:21.221 --> 00:28:22.309
Okay.

570
00:28:22.396 --> 00:28:23.702
Well. I'm glad you're back.

571
00:28:23.789 --> 00:28:25.486
I need to run to my niece's
school Christmas program tonight

572
00:28:25.573 --> 00:28:26.443
that I told you about?

573
00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:27.880
Yes. so I'm closing up then.

574
00:28:27.967 --> 00:28:29.664
Yep.

575
00:28:29.751 --> 00:28:29.969
Have a good night.

576
00:28:30.056 --> 00:28:30.709
You too.

577
00:28:31.927 --> 00:28:34.930
Maybe I'll give the
mama one to you instead.

578
00:28:34.974 --> 00:28:37.193
Now. what are they making?

579
00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.456
You've never seen

580
00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.458
an ugly Christmas
sweater before?

581
00:28:41.502 --> 00:28:44.418
Oh. I have. I just didn't
know people made their own.

582
00:28:44.461 --> 00:28:46.115
Oh. they do here.

583
00:28:46.202 --> 00:28:46.986
Huh.

584
00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:49.292
What size sweater do you wear?

585
00:28:50.816 --> 00:28:53.644
Have you always wanted to
run your family's store?

586
00:28:53.732 --> 00:28:56.430
Sure. I love it.

587
00:28:56.517 --> 00:28:57.779
Ever found a secret
letter in a book.

588
00:28:57.823 --> 00:29:00.390
like when it was
your grandpa's store?

589
00:29:00.477 --> 00:29:03.959
No. receipts. yes. inscriptions.

590
00:29:04.003 --> 00:29:07.093
or "To my grandson. Timmy."
kind of sentiments. yes.

591
00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:09.486
But never a Santa letter.

592
00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:11.053
I was always careful
to put the postage

593
00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:14.361
on my letters to Santa. took
them to the mailbox myself.

594
00:29:14.448 --> 00:29:17.190
Really. what kinda
things did you write?

595
00:29:17.277 --> 00:29:21.760
The usual. "Can I please
have a skateboard or a toy?"

596
00:29:21.847 --> 00:29:24.980
Or I'd plead for forgiveness
if I was feeling really guilty

597
00:29:25.067 --> 00:29:26.721
about something I had
done that I was sure

598
00:29:26.808 --> 00:29:29.376
would keep me from getting
any presents at all that year.

599
00:29:29.463 --> 00:29:31.465
That's sweet.

600
00:29:31.508 --> 00:29:32.379
What about you?

601
00:29:32.466 --> 00:29:33.946
Any letters to Santa?

602
00:29:34.033 --> 00:29:36.949
Yeah. it was a
tradition growing up.

603
00:29:37.036 --> 00:29:40.343
so my brothers and I would
sit around the dinner table

604
00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:43.042
on the first Sunday of
December and write our letters.

605
00:29:43.129 --> 00:29:45.087
And what would you write?

606
00:29:45.174 --> 00:29:47.742
Oh. my memory is pretty vague.

607
00:29:47.829 --> 00:29:51.659
I remember what it
felt like though.

608
00:29:51.746 --> 00:29:54.880
that warm. excitement
of the season.

609
00:29:54.923 --> 00:29:59.972
Beyond that. well. actually
I do remember this one time.

610
00:30:00.015 --> 00:30:02.017
Yeah. do tell.

611
00:30:02.104 --> 00:30:06.413
So my parents were actually
struggling with this place.

612
00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:07.457
It was a bookstore still.

613
00:30:07.544 --> 00:30:10.112
and it had a bad couple
of years of sales.

614
00:30:10.199 --> 00:30:10.852
and then there was
a fire next door.

615
00:30:10.939 --> 00:30:13.681
which caused some damage here.

616
00:30:13.768 --> 00:30:17.032
And. well. nobody wants
to buy smokey books.

617
00:30:17.119 --> 00:30:22.211
So I wrote to Santa and
asked him to save the store.

618
00:30:22.298 --> 00:30:24.170
No wonder you liked
Judith's letter.

619
00:30:24.257 --> 00:30:25.562
What do you mean?

620
00:30:25.649 --> 00:30:27.303
Well. she was looking out
for someone else's happiness.

621
00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:31.133
not just her own. like you did.

622
00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:33.179
You're giving me
too much credit.

623
00:30:33.266 --> 00:30:36.312
I think I was just scared
at all the uncertainty.

624
00:30:36.399 --> 00:30:40.229
Yeah. but still. you could've
wished for a stuffed animal

625
00:30:40.273 --> 00:30:42.231
or a toy or something
to comfort you.

626
00:30:42.318 --> 00:30:48.542
but. well. I guess you got
what you wished for. I assume.

627
00:30:48.585 --> 00:30:50.979
We survived through it. yeah.

628
00:30:51.066 --> 00:30:54.374
That's when my parents
turned it into a toy store.

629
00:30:54.417 --> 00:30:58.987
And here we are. years
later. with crafts.

630
00:30:59.074 --> 00:31:01.250
Is that why you do the
toy and book drive?

631
00:31:01.294 --> 00:31:03.339
A homage to your
family's legacy?

632
00:31:03.426 --> 00:31:05.080
You've figured me out.

633
00:31:05.124 --> 00:31:08.779
No. it's actually an annual
drive the county has.

634
00:31:08.867 --> 00:31:16.526
I just. I like to help out.

635
00:31:16.613 --> 00:31:20.052
So how's the sweater
coming along?

636
00:31:20.139 --> 00:31:23.446
Do you have any of those
fuzzy stick thingies?

637
00:31:23.533 --> 00:31:24.317
Pipe cleaners?

638
00:31:24.404 --> 00:31:24.883
Yeah.

639
00:31:24.926 --> 00:31:26.014
Here.

640
00:31:26.101 --> 00:31:31.846
Perfect.

641
00:31:31.933 --> 00:31:35.067
And voila!

642
00:31:35.154 --> 00:31:39.985
That is one of the
finest I have seen. yes.

643
00:31:40.072 --> 00:31:42.291
We have to get our
pictures taken in these.

644
00:31:42.378 --> 00:31:44.728
What. no. no. no. I never--

645
00:31:44.772 --> 00:31:45.164
Come on. yes.

646
00:31:45.251 --> 00:31:46.905
Really?

647
00:31:47.731 --> 00:31:51.126
All right. one. two. three.

648
00:32:49.141 --> 00:32:53.058
"I found a coin I think
my father would like.

649
00:32:53.145 --> 00:32:55.582
"he died in the war though.

650
00:32:55.669 --> 00:32:56.713
"For Christmas this year.

651
00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:00.195
"could my present be you
giving this to my father?

652
00:33:00.239 --> 00:33:06.462
"He liked collecting these."

653
00:33:06.549 --> 00:33:08.899
A coin collector.

654
00:33:15.167 --> 00:33:16.559
Here you go.
paint's on the table

655
00:33:16.603 --> 00:33:18.039
and glue guns are
plugged in too.

656
00:33:18.126 --> 00:33:21.173
Thank you.

657
00:33:21.216 --> 00:33:23.175
Oh. here. come look
through one of these.

658
00:33:23.218 --> 00:33:25.177
Can't I make an ornament too?

659
00:33:25.264 --> 00:33:27.962
Nope. and make sure
you look at every name.

660
00:33:28.049 --> 00:33:28.745
I will.

661
00:33:28.832 --> 00:33:29.529
Because if you miss one--

662
00:33:29.572 --> 00:33:31.052
I get it.

663
00:33:32.097 --> 00:33:36.231
Ooh. saved by the.
oh. it's just you.

664
00:33:36.318 --> 00:33:37.058
Hi.

665
00:33:37.102 --> 00:33:38.407
Hey. did you find something?

666
00:33:38.451 --> 00:33:40.192
Eh. I wish. I still have
a few books to go through.

667
00:33:40.235 --> 00:33:42.063
but I wondered about the coin.

668
00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:43.847
What about it?

669
00:33:43.934 --> 00:33:45.588
Well. Judith said her
dad was a collector.

670
00:33:45.675 --> 00:33:48.113
coin collecting can be
a community of its own.

671
00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:49.114
I was gonna follow
up with a friend

672
00:33:49.201 --> 00:33:50.245
and see if he has any ideas

673
00:33:50.332 --> 00:33:51.420
on how to trace the
coin to its owner.

674
00:33:51.464 --> 00:33:55.729
But Judith said she found
the coin. not her dad.

675
00:33:55.772 --> 00:33:57.470
Well. found could
mean she bought it

676
00:33:57.557 --> 00:33:58.297
or someone in her family.

677
00:33:58.384 --> 00:34:00.125
What if there's a
way to track down

678
00:34:00.212 --> 00:34:02.257
who bought that particular coin?

679
00:34:02.301 --> 00:34:04.390
Well. I guess it doesn't
hurt to look into it.

680
00:34:04.477 --> 00:34:06.087
Do you mind if I borrow
it for a few hours?

681
00:34:06.131 --> 00:34:09.090
Sure. just take care of it.

682
00:34:09.177 --> 00:34:12.659
It might. well. it
might be worth a lot.

683
00:34:12.746 --> 00:34:14.139
You bet. I'll be back soon.

684
00:34:14.226 --> 00:34:17.751
Okay.

685
00:34:17.794 --> 00:34:19.622
You know. tonight
at the town square

686
00:34:19.709 --> 00:34:22.016
there are a whole bunch
of Christmas activities.

687
00:34:22.103 --> 00:34:24.584
sleigh rides. Christmas
lights. hot chocolate bar.

688
00:34:24.671 --> 00:34:26.673
Santa. the whole big deal.

689
00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:27.630
You should go.

690
00:34:27.717 --> 00:34:28.762
Oh. I don't know.

691
00:34:28.805 --> 00:34:30.155
You can still
celebrate Christmas

692
00:34:30.242 --> 00:34:31.634
even if your
family's not around.

693
00:34:31.721 --> 00:34:32.200
I know that.

694
00:34:32.287 --> 00:34:34.246
Think on it then.

695
00:34:34.289 --> 00:34:36.987
And. you know. maybe
take someone with you.

696
00:34:37.075 --> 00:34:47.085
Keep searching!

697
00:34:47.172 --> 00:34:50.044
And you can order
ahead for Christmas.

698
00:34:50.131 --> 00:34:52.699
we just need orders no
later than the 21st.

699
00:34:52.786 --> 00:34:55.963
Okay. thank you.

700
00:34:56.006 --> 00:34:56.877
Hey. Eli.

701
00:34:56.964 --> 00:34:58.183
Ah. good to see ya. Jonah.

702
00:34:58.270 --> 00:34:59.662
Good to see you too.

703
00:34:59.749 --> 00:35:01.795
Can I get a raspberry
cream cheese pie?

704
00:35:01.882 --> 00:35:02.535
The whole pie?

705
00:35:02.622 --> 00:35:04.624
You going off the deep end?

706
00:35:04.667 --> 00:35:06.104
Not at all.

707
00:35:06.191 --> 00:35:09.977
I do have something that might
catch your interest. though.

708
00:35:10.064 --> 00:35:11.326
Hundreds of these
were minted in 1895.

709
00:35:11.413 --> 00:35:13.111
These are pretty sought after.

710
00:35:13.198 --> 00:35:15.374
So it's valuable?

711
00:35:15.461 --> 00:35:17.811
Definitely. this
is a proof coin.

712
00:35:17.898 --> 00:35:19.769
so it wasn't released
to general circulation

713
00:35:19.856 --> 00:35:21.554
like the rest of money is.

714
00:35:21.641 --> 00:35:25.471
So how would somebody get their
hands on a coin like this?

715
00:35:25.514 --> 00:35:27.473
Buying it from the mint.

716
00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:29.866
inheriting it from
another collector.

717
00:35:29.953 --> 00:35:32.217
maybe somebody made the mistake
of using it at face value

718
00:35:32.304 --> 00:35:34.871
and that's how it entered
circulation that way.

719
00:35:34.915 --> 00:35:36.395
I'm trying to help someone
track down the owner.

720
00:35:36.482 --> 00:35:39.267
Is there a record of coins?

721
00:35:39.354 --> 00:35:41.922
Something that
says who owns what.

722
00:35:42.009 --> 00:35:45.578
Like a magic database
of coin collectors?

723
00:35:45.665 --> 00:35:46.753
Too good to be true?

724
00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:49.190
You know. you could check
the credit card records

725
00:35:49.277 --> 00:35:50.191
of the store that sold it.

726
00:35:50.278 --> 00:35:52.628
Not sure it was sold at a store.

727
00:35:52.715 --> 00:35:54.848
Even if it was. it'd
be over 70 years ago.

728
00:35:54.935 --> 00:35:58.504
Whoo. good luck.

729
00:35:58.547 --> 00:35:59.809
Hey. you still want that pie?

730
00:35:59.896 --> 00:36:02.682
Oh yeah. throw a couple
forks in there too.

731
00:36:02.769 --> 00:36:04.031
All right.

732
00:36:10.429 --> 00:36:12.431
Hey. you're back already.

733
00:36:12.518 --> 00:36:14.694
Yeah. and I brought pie.

734
00:36:14.781 --> 00:36:15.477
Pie?

735
00:36:15.564 --> 00:36:16.870
And the coin.

736
00:36:16.957 --> 00:36:18.263
Oh. what did you find out?

737
00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:19.525
Nothing helpful.

738
00:36:19.612 --> 00:36:21.744
I was hoping collectors
had a community or a group

739
00:36:21.831 --> 00:36:24.399
or some way to tell
who has what coin.

740
00:36:24.443 --> 00:36:27.272
but it was just so long
ago it's a dead end.

741
00:36:27.315 --> 00:36:30.927
Yeah. that's a challenge
with this all around.

742
00:36:30.971 --> 00:36:37.586
Oh. wow. that looks amazing.

743
00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:39.109
Mm-hmm. what do you think?

744
00:36:39.197 --> 00:36:40.415
You didn't want any. right?

745
00:36:40.502 --> 00:36:43.984
I'm glad you like
it. it's my favorite.

746
00:36:44.071 --> 00:36:49.207
Oh. hang on. it's work.

747
00:36:49.294 --> 00:36:52.645
Hello. yeah. about two
weeks we'll be. what?

748
00:36:52.732 --> 00:36:53.515
No. that soon?

749
00:36:53.602 --> 00:36:56.562
I can't get guys there in time.

750
00:36:56.649 --> 00:37:03.264
Yeah. I understand. I'll see
what I can do. yeah. bye.

751
00:37:03.351 --> 00:37:04.396
I've got this client.

752
00:37:04.439 --> 00:37:07.268
they have an event
early next week

753
00:37:07.355 --> 00:37:09.227
and I've gotta finish
with my job before then.

754
00:37:09.314 --> 00:37:11.403
Oh. how much more
work is there to do?

755
00:37:11.446 --> 00:37:13.318
Well. it's down to cosmetics.

756
00:37:13.361 --> 00:37:15.233
fixtures and paint and
a few other touch ups.

757
00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:18.627
but I can't get
guys there in time.

758
00:37:18.714 --> 00:37:21.108
They're on another job.
and it's the weekend.

759
00:37:21.195 --> 00:37:23.284
So I gotta go.

760
00:37:23.371 --> 00:37:25.678
Do you want some help?

761
00:37:25.765 --> 00:37:27.201
What?

762
00:37:27.288 --> 00:37:30.335
I am not an expert builder.
but I can follow instructions.

763
00:37:30.422 --> 00:37:31.727
No. I couldn't.

764
00:37:31.814 --> 00:37:33.642
Oh no. please. you have helped
me so much with the letter

765
00:37:33.686 --> 00:37:35.514
and you just brought me pie.

766
00:37:35.557 --> 00:37:37.777
Yeah. but your store. I mean.
I can't have you shut down

767
00:37:37.864 --> 00:37:39.344
because of me. it's
Christmas time.

768
00:37:39.387 --> 00:37:43.435
No. Gabby's scheduled
to come in any minute.

769
00:37:43.478 --> 00:37:45.480
Okay then. I've
just gotta pick up

770
00:37:45.567 --> 00:37:47.656
some work clothes on the way.

771
00:37:47.743 --> 00:37:50.529
Sounds good.

772
00:37:50.616 --> 00:37:54.620
So you said something went
wrong here and set things back?

773
00:37:54.707 --> 00:37:56.274
Yeah. right here.

774
00:37:56.317 --> 00:37:57.579
I hired a plumbing contractor

775
00:37:57.666 --> 00:38:01.017
who didn't properly seal
a pipe. so disaster.

776
00:38:01.104 --> 00:38:01.888
Well. shouldn't the plumber

777
00:38:01.975 --> 00:38:02.628
have checked his
work or something?

778
00:38:02.715 --> 00:38:05.848
Yeah. well. it got past him.

779
00:38:05.935 --> 00:38:06.980
It got past me too.

780
00:38:07.067 --> 00:38:09.330
And he refused to fix
it or make things right.

781
00:38:09.417 --> 00:38:10.636
he just tried to pass the blame.

782
00:38:10.723 --> 00:38:12.290
So of course the owner
here wasn't happy. so...

783
00:38:12.377 --> 00:38:15.293
So you're left to
pick up the pieces.

784
00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:17.730
Yeah. well. more like
patch up the pieces.

785
00:38:17.817 --> 00:38:18.644
That sounds--

786
00:38:18.731 --> 00:38:19.819
Expensive?

787
00:38:19.906 --> 00:38:21.473
Well. I was gonna say
not fun. but [chuckles].

788
00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:23.388
Well. the work isn't bad.

789
00:38:23.431 --> 00:38:26.216
but paying for someone
else's mistake. yeah.

790
00:38:26.304 --> 00:38:28.958
Well. point me wherever
you want me to start.

791
00:38:29.045 --> 00:38:32.658
I am sure we can get through
this faster together.

792
00:38:32.745 --> 00:38:35.269
All right. well. why
don't you wear this

793
00:38:35.356 --> 00:38:37.880
and you get started here
and I'll work on the trim.

794
00:38:37.967 --> 00:38:38.403
Sounds good.

824
00:40:02.269 --> 00:40:04.837
No. but it gets me closer.

825
00:40:04.924 --> 00:40:06.360
Now I can finish the rest
myself without losing sleep.

826
00:40:06.447 --> 00:40:09.145
Good!

827
00:40:09.232 --> 00:40:11.539
Phew. seriously. thank you.

828
00:40:11.626 --> 00:40:16.414
I'm just glad I was able to
do something to help you too.

829
00:40:16.457 --> 00:40:20.026
I think I at least
owe you dinner.

830
00:40:20.113 --> 00:40:22.420
Actually. I have a better idea.

831
00:40:36.129 --> 00:40:38.740
Gabby told me about this place.

832
00:40:38.827 --> 00:40:41.351
it sounded like a
nice break from work.

833
00:40:41.439 --> 00:40:43.441
Oh. it definitely is.

834
00:40:43.528 --> 00:40:45.181
You can just feel
the giddiness here.

835
00:40:45.225 --> 00:40:46.444
Why is that with Christmas?

836
00:40:46.531 --> 00:40:50.926
I don't know. maybe it reminds
us of when we were young.

837
00:40:51.013 --> 00:40:52.885
Yeah. you have any
favorite holiday memories

838
00:40:52.972 --> 00:40:54.060
from when you were younger?

839
00:40:54.147 --> 00:40:56.062
Being with my family.

840
00:40:56.149 --> 00:40:58.064
Didn't you say you
were on your own

841
00:40:58.151 --> 00:40:59.457
this year for Christmas?

842
00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.023
I did.

843
00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:04.200
Well. that's no good;
come to my place.

844
00:41:04.244 --> 00:41:06.899
Oh no. I couldn't. I
don't wanna intrude.

845
00:41:06.986 --> 00:41:10.076
No. you wouldn't intrude.
it'd be nice to have you.

846
00:41:10.163 --> 00:41:12.600
I mean. you can't be
alone for Christmas

847
00:41:12.687 --> 00:41:16.952
when what you love about it
is being with other people.

848
00:41:17.039 --> 00:41:21.087
Okay. but only if you let
me help with the dinner.

849
00:41:21.174 --> 00:41:23.872
Perfect. I definitely
need help with that.

850
00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:32.402
Oh look. kids can write
their own letter to Santa.

851
00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:35.275
Well. not just kids.

852
00:41:35.362 --> 00:41:36.537
You'll write one too. won't you?

853
00:41:36.624 --> 00:41:44.153
Yeah. why not?

854
00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:45.720
What are you gonna write?

855
00:41:45.764 --> 00:41:47.809
We're not supposed to talk
about that kinda thing.

856
00:41:47.896 --> 00:41:48.593
it's supposed to be a secret.

857
00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:50.116
No. that's birthday wishes.

858
00:41:50.203 --> 00:41:51.509
Well. maybe I wanna
keep mine a secret.

859
00:41:51.596 --> 00:42:00.953
Okay. okay.

860
00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:04.086
You all right there?

861
00:42:04.173 --> 00:42:08.961
Yeah. I just wanna
get the wording right.

862
00:42:09.048 --> 00:42:10.310
Hey. hey. no peaking!

863
00:42:10.397 --> 00:42:12.268
I wouldn't dare.

864
00:42:12.355 --> 00:42:15.707
Yeah. right.

865
00:42:15.794 --> 00:42:18.144
Okay. done!

866
00:42:18.231 --> 00:42:19.275
Should we send them off?

867
00:42:19.362 --> 00:42:24.367
Yeah.

868
00:42:24.454 --> 00:42:26.065
Okay. on three?

869
00:42:26.152 --> 00:42:28.371
One.

870
00:42:28.458 --> 00:42:29.198
Two.

871
00:42:29.242 --> 00:42:33.028
Three!

872
00:42:33.115 --> 00:42:35.074
We did it.

873
00:42:35.161 --> 00:42:38.294
We did. we did it!

874
00:42:42.081 --> 00:42:45.606
Thank you.

875
00:42:45.693 --> 00:42:47.260
Thank you.

876
00:42:47.347 --> 00:42:51.830
Mm. now that's a hot chocolate.

877
00:42:51.917 --> 00:42:54.180
So what did you put in
your letter to Santa?

878
00:42:54.267 --> 00:42:58.010
I asked to find Judith
in time for Christmas.

879
00:42:58.097 --> 00:42:59.446
I thought you might.

880
00:42:59.489 --> 00:43:01.013
What about you?

881
00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:03.015
I'm not gonna tell.

882
00:43:03.102 --> 00:43:04.407
What?

883
00:43:04.494 --> 00:43:05.887
Well. just in case it is
like a birthday wish thing.

884
00:43:05.974 --> 00:43:07.193
Well then why did you ask me?

885
00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:09.891
Can't blame a guy
for being curious.

886
00:43:09.978 --> 00:43:11.153
Well. that is a double standard.

887
00:43:11.197 --> 00:43:14.504
Yep. I can admit to that.

888
00:43:14.592 --> 00:43:16.550
Okay. so don't tell me
what you put in the letter.

889
00:43:16.637 --> 00:43:18.770
but what's number two
on your Christmas list

890
00:43:18.857 --> 00:43:21.076
that you didn't
write to Santa about?

891
00:43:21.163 --> 00:43:23.122
Okay. second best thing--

892
00:43:23.165 --> 00:43:24.732
Mm-hmm.

893
00:43:24.819 --> 00:43:26.691
Is have my bills paid.

894
00:43:26.778 --> 00:43:30.564
Oh yeah. that's not exciting.

895
00:43:30.651 --> 00:43:32.392
Well. it is if you have to pay

896
00:43:32.479 --> 00:43:35.090
for a certain
plumber's mistakes.

897
00:43:35.177 --> 00:43:39.442
Sorry. but you have to have
something that you want.

898
00:43:39.529 --> 00:43:42.097
All right. I mean. what
are you looking for?

899
00:43:42.184 --> 00:43:44.143
Something that I can have
wrapped and put under my tree?

900
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:46.841
Sure. something tangible.

901
00:43:46.885 --> 00:43:50.062
Okay. a good book.

902
00:43:50.149 --> 00:43:52.064
A classic like "A
Christmas Carol"?

903
00:43:54.719 --> 00:43:55.241
Eh. maybe.

904
00:43:55.328 --> 00:43:57.243
No Dickens then.

905
00:43:57.330 --> 00:44:00.159
What are your favorites?

906
00:44:00.246 --> 00:44:03.162
Books that have been
made into movies.

907
00:44:03.249 --> 00:44:04.990
You don't even read
the books. do you?

908
00:44:05.033 --> 00:44:06.861
You just watch the
movie versions.

909
00:44:06.905 --> 00:44:08.123
That way I can tell
if I like it or not

910
00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:09.734
without spending
the time to read it.

911
00:44:09.777 --> 00:44:12.911
All right then. what
movies do you like?

912
00:44:12.998 --> 00:44:14.086
Spy ones.

913
00:44:14.173 --> 00:44:16.044
Ooh. action junkie?

914
00:44:16.131 --> 00:44:17.655
Yes and no.

915
00:44:17.698 --> 00:44:20.527
I like the intrigue
and subplots.

916
00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:22.137
Hmm.

917
00:44:22.224 --> 00:44:25.619
I know. I know. I have
lowered your opinion of me.

918
00:44:25.706 --> 00:44:27.403
No.

919
00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:28.709
Oh. I'm sure I have.

920
00:44:28.796 --> 00:44:30.102
You were hoping I was
gonna say something deeper.

921
00:44:30.189 --> 00:44:34.759
Nope. doesn't matter.

922
00:44:34.846 --> 00:44:38.588
I just like learning
more about you.

923
00:44:38.676 --> 00:44:39.154
You do?

924
00:44:39.241 --> 00:44:47.815
Yeah. yeah. I do.

925
00:44:47.902 --> 00:44:50.905
Come on. everyone.
time to see Santa!

926
00:44:50.949 --> 00:44:53.299
Ho. ho. ho. ho. ho.
ho. ho. ho. ho. ho.

927
00:44:53.386 --> 00:44:59.044
Ho. ho. ho. ho. ho.
ho. ho. ho. ho. ho. ho.

928
00:45:40.389 --> 00:45:43.088
Jonah. good morning!

929
00:45:43.175 --> 00:45:44.654
Hey. sorry to bother you.

930
00:45:44.698 --> 00:45:47.440
No. not at all. I'm just
taking a quick break.

931
00:45:47.527 --> 00:45:49.311
Been making a list of all
the Judiths in the yearbook.

932
00:45:49.355 --> 00:45:51.313
Oh. any Judith Franklins?

933
00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:54.882
No. it could be a
complete waste of time.

934
00:45:54.969 --> 00:45:56.449
but thought it
might come in handy

935
00:45:56.536 --> 00:45:58.494
if we find something else.

936
00:45:58.581 --> 00:46:00.322
What are you up to?

937
00:46:00.409 --> 00:46:02.585
I'm looking around
my kitchen realizing

938
00:46:02.672 --> 00:46:06.415
I probably need food if I plan
on making Christmas dinner.

939
00:46:06.502 --> 00:46:08.635
That would be a good assumption.

940
00:46:08.678 --> 00:46:12.770
I don't know what
to cook or to buy.

941
00:46:12.857 --> 00:46:15.294
Would you mind brainstorming
with me on that?

942
00:46:15.381 --> 00:46:19.951
Sure. yeah. I just have one
quick stop to make first.

943
00:46:42.538 --> 00:46:43.235
Hey. thanks for coming!

944
00:46:43.322 --> 00:46:45.324
Hi. I brought ideas.

945
00:46:45.367 --> 00:46:48.980
Excellent. I need all
the help I can get.

946
00:46:49.067 --> 00:46:49.981
Come on in.

947
00:46:50.024 --> 00:47:00.861
Great.

948
00:47:00.905 --> 00:47:02.210
Hmm.

949
00:47:02.297 --> 00:47:04.430
Well. what do you suggest?

950
00:47:04.517 --> 00:47:06.736
Any favorites your parents like?

951
00:47:06.824 --> 00:47:08.303
They're pretty traditional.

952
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:11.437
One year I recommended steaks
and my mom about lost it.

953
00:47:11.524 --> 00:47:14.657
Okay. ham maybe?

954
00:47:14.744 --> 00:47:17.095
Turkey's always good.
but after Thanksgiving.

955
00:47:17.182 --> 00:47:19.184
some people are done
with turkey for awhile.

956
00:47:19.271 --> 00:47:21.360
Hmm. what's easier?

957
00:47:21.447 --> 00:47:26.974
Ham. definitely.

958
00:47:27.061 --> 00:47:29.063
Ham. perfect.

959
00:47:29.107 --> 00:47:30.586
Okay. what about sides?

960
00:47:30.673 --> 00:47:31.805
Do rolls count?

961
00:47:31.892 --> 00:47:35.504
Here. do your parents
like sweet potatoes

962
00:47:35.591 --> 00:47:38.768
or regular potatoes. casseroles?

963
00:47:38.856 --> 00:47:41.119
Sweet potatoes. sure.

964
00:47:41.206 --> 00:47:44.078
Okay. any other
favorite veggies?

965
00:47:44.165 --> 00:47:46.254
My mom makes this
amazing phyllo dough tart

966
00:47:46.341 --> 00:47:49.649
with mushrooms
and a sauce on it.

967
00:47:49.736 --> 00:47:50.998
Still don't know
what it really is.

968
00:47:51.085 --> 00:47:54.001
but Christmas-only tradition.

969
00:47:54.088 --> 00:47:55.307
Mushrooms for Christmas?

970
00:47:55.394 --> 00:47:58.484
Hey. don't knock
it till you try it!

971
00:47:58.571 --> 00:48:00.790
Come on. there must
be something special

972
00:48:00.834 --> 00:48:02.531
you'd want as part
of the dinner.

973
00:48:02.618 --> 00:48:04.664
Actually. there is something.

974
00:48:04.751 --> 00:48:06.361
That raspberry cream cheese pie.

975
00:48:06.448 --> 00:48:09.408
Okay. I will bring that then.

976
00:48:09.495 --> 00:48:12.977
But don't think that gets
you out of helping me cook.

977
00:48:13.064 --> 00:48:15.283
No. no. course not.

978
00:48:19.592 --> 00:48:20.854
Well. thanks for your help.

979
00:48:20.941 --> 00:48:21.637
Don't lose that. half the stress

980
00:48:21.681 --> 00:48:23.901
is knowing what you'll cook.

981
00:48:23.988 --> 00:48:26.077
And the other half is
actually cooking it.

982
00:48:26.164 --> 00:48:28.209
Yep.

983
00:48:28.296 --> 00:48:34.172
Oh!
Oops.

984
00:48:34.259 --> 00:48:37.349
Oh. thanks.

985
00:48:37.436 --> 00:48:41.005
So what are you up to today?

986
00:48:41.048 --> 00:48:44.095
Oh. I actually need
to pick up donations

987
00:48:44.182 --> 00:48:46.836
at a few drop-off spots and
take them to the county.

988
00:48:46.924 --> 00:48:48.708
Well. I can give you a hand.

989
00:48:48.795 --> 00:48:51.015
Oh. you don't have to do that.

990
00:48:51.102 --> 00:48:52.320
I'd like to.

991
00:48:52.407 --> 00:48:52.886
You sure?

992
00:48:52.973 --> 00:48:59.240
Yeah. let's go.

993
00:48:59.327 --> 00:49:05.203
Oh!
Oops.

994
00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:08.380
Oh. thanks.

995
00:49:08.467 --> 00:49:11.992
So what are you up to today?

996
00:49:12.079 --> 00:49:15.126
Oh. I actually need
to pick up donations

997
00:49:15.213 --> 00:49:17.824
at a few drop-off spots and
take them to the county.

998
00:49:17.911 --> 00:49:19.739
Well. I can give you a hand.

999
00:49:19.826 --> 00:49:22.046
Oh. you don't have to do that.

1000
00:49:22.133 --> 00:49:23.264
I'd like to.

1001
00:49:23.351 --> 00:49:23.873
You sure?

1002
00:49:23.961 --> 00:49:28.226
Yeah. let's go.

1003
00:49:28.313 --> 00:49:31.620
Well. a lot came in here!

1004
00:49:31.707 --> 00:49:34.493
Do we take the whole
box or just empty it?

1005
00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:35.537
Well. there's still a
few days until Christmas.

1006
00:49:35.624 --> 00:49:39.019
so I say we just
empty it for now.

1007
00:49:39.063 --> 00:49:42.066
All right.

1008
00:49:42.153 --> 00:49:44.024
Have you finished going
through the yearbooks yet?

1009
00:49:44.111 --> 00:49:45.504
Getting there.

1010
00:49:45.547 --> 00:49:49.377
I have this idea in my mind
about what Judith looks like.

1011
00:49:49.464 --> 00:49:50.988
Is that funny?

1012
00:49:51.031 --> 00:49:52.293
No. I don't think so.

1013
00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:55.079
I go over the yearbook
photos and I see certain ones

1014
00:49:55.122 --> 00:49:57.429
and I get excited if
it fits that image.

1015
00:49:57.516 --> 00:50:00.084
Until you see the name?

1016
00:50:00.127 --> 00:50:02.521
Yeah. this whole thing's
kind of strange. isn't it?

1017
00:50:02.608 --> 00:50:07.961
Well. I think there's
a good reason for it.

1018
00:50:08.048 --> 00:50:10.224
Be honest with me.

1019
00:50:10.311 --> 00:50:13.836
do you think we're
gonna find her in time?

1020
00:50:13.923 --> 00:50:16.317
I don't know if we'll
find her by Christmas.

1021
00:50:16.404 --> 00:50:22.062
but I do believe we'll find her.

1022
00:50:31.332 --> 00:50:32.942
So how many bags
of toys and books

1023
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:34.335
did we collect this year?

1024
00:50:34.422 --> 00:50:36.642
In our store. a good
four large bags.

1025
00:50:36.729 --> 00:50:40.428
but a lot more came in from
other spots throughout town.

1026
00:50:40.472 --> 00:50:42.778
It was nice of
Jonah to help you.

1027
00:50:42.865 --> 00:50:47.740
Yeah. I wish...

1028
00:50:47.827 --> 00:50:50.351
What?

1029
00:50:50.438 --> 00:50:52.658
I think Jonah's in
a bit of trouble.

1030
00:50:52.745 --> 00:50:54.094
Really?

1031
00:50:54.138 --> 00:50:56.966
Like. money trouble.

1032
00:50:57.054 --> 00:50:59.882
He talks about it like he's
okay and he can handle it.

1033
00:50:59.969 --> 00:51:02.972
but I think it's worse
than what he's saying.

1034
00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:05.366
That's rough. he's
such a good guy.

1035
00:51:05.453 --> 00:51:09.588
Yeah. and I wanna be able to
help him. but I'm not sure--

1036
00:51:09.631 --> 00:51:11.677
If he'd accept?

1037
00:51:11.764 --> 00:51:15.550
He seems like the type who
wants to earn his own way.

1038
00:51:15.637 --> 00:51:19.076
Yeah. and I like that about him.

1039
00:51:19.119 --> 00:51:23.689
But then how can I help if...

1040
00:51:23.776 --> 00:51:25.995
Have an idea?

1041
00:51:26.083 --> 00:51:26.648
A little inspiration. yeah.

1042
00:51:38.834 --> 00:51:40.140
Well. hi.

1043
00:51:40.184 --> 00:51:41.489
Hi.

1044
00:51:41.533 --> 00:51:43.230
I'm sorry. we're not
open for services

1045
00:51:43.317 --> 00:51:44.144
for a few more weeks.

1046
00:51:44.188 --> 00:51:44.884
Oh. I know.

1047
00:51:44.971 --> 00:51:45.580
Are you the pastor here then?

1048
00:51:45.624 --> 00:51:47.582
I am.

1049
00:51:47.669 --> 00:51:51.108
I'm Mandy. I actually
have a favor to ask you.

1050
00:51:51.151 --> 00:51:52.587
Oh. well. have a seat.

1051
00:51:52.674 --> 00:51:54.372
Thank you.

1052
00:51:54.459 --> 00:52:18.570
Yeah.

1053
00:52:30.799 --> 00:52:52.995
Oh. come on.

1054
00:52:53.082 --> 00:53:19.152
What. the coin!

1055
00:53:21.633 --> 00:53:26.115
Hey. Mandy. are you okay?

1056
00:53:26.203 --> 00:53:28.640
The coin. I have
looked everywhere!

1057
00:53:28.727 --> 00:53:29.728
Oh. it's gone?

1058
00:53:29.815 --> 00:53:31.773
Well. I thought I put
it back in the box.

1059
00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:32.731
Is there anywhere else
you might've put it?

1060
00:53:32.774 --> 00:53:35.864
No. I kept it in here.

1061
00:53:35.951 --> 00:53:37.126
I can't believe it's gone.

1062
00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:37.953
Have you looked
around the store?

1063
00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:39.216
Maybe it fell.

1064
00:53:39.303 --> 00:53:40.347
Well. that's what I thought.

1065
00:53:40.434 --> 00:53:42.567
I dropped some stuff.
but I have been scouring

1066
00:53:42.654 --> 00:53:44.003
through here all morning and...

1067
00:53:44.090 --> 00:53:46.353
What about Gabby. does
she have any ideas?

1068
00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:51.402
I called earlier and nothing.

1069
00:53:51.445 --> 00:53:53.099
What if I find Judith?

1070
00:53:53.142 --> 00:53:56.145
Without the coin. how
can I even face her?

1071
00:53:56.233 --> 00:53:59.975
I wouldn't worry about that.

1072
00:54:00.019 --> 00:54:04.197
Hey. we'd be lucky
if we even find her.

1073
00:54:04.284 --> 00:54:05.851
All right. we're gonna keep
looking. don't give up.

1074
00:54:05.938 --> 00:54:08.941
It's just. it's worth a lot.

1075
00:54:09.028 --> 00:54:11.900
For a regular coin. it
wouldn't be a big deal.

1076
00:54:11.987 --> 00:54:14.903
but that is not the case.

1077
00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:15.817
It could change her life.

1078
00:54:15.904 --> 00:54:20.300
I know. could change
anyone's life.

1079
00:54:20.387 --> 00:54:22.389
All right. when was the
last time you saw it?

1080
00:54:22.476 --> 00:54:26.001
Um. you had just borrowed it.

1081
00:54:26.088 --> 00:54:27.002
Right. and I brought it back

1082
00:54:27.046 --> 00:54:28.003
after I showed my
collector friend.

1083
00:54:28.090 --> 00:54:30.789
Right. and then I put
it back in the box.

1084
00:54:30.876 --> 00:54:33.095
And nothing since then?

1085
00:54:33.182 --> 00:54:36.534
No. did you come
back for it at all?

1086
00:54:36.621 --> 00:54:39.450
Maybe to take a second look?

1087
00:54:39.537 --> 00:54:42.801
No. and I'd never take
it without asking you.

1088
00:54:42.888 --> 00:54:46.195
It's just. I know you said
money's kind of an issue

1089
00:54:46.239 --> 00:54:51.244
right now and the
coin could help. so...

1090
00:54:51.331 --> 00:54:56.205
Are you. Mandy. I'd never
do something like that!

1091
00:54:56.293 --> 00:54:57.642
I'm surprised you
think that of me.

1092
00:54:57.685 --> 00:55:02.864
No. look. sorry. just forget it.

1093
00:55:02.951 --> 00:55:05.476
I gotta go.

1094
00:55:05.519 --> 00:55:06.607
Jonah!

1095
00:55:06.694 --> 00:55:08.261
I gotta clean up that job site.

1096
00:55:08.348 --> 00:55:11.133
No. look. sorry. I
shouldn't have said that.

1097
00:55:11.177 --> 00:55:13.135
Yeah.

1098
00:55:13.222 --> 00:55:19.707
Jonah. wait!

1099
00:55:19.794 --> 00:55:21.666
It's not like I
was accusing him.

1100
00:55:21.753 --> 00:55:22.623
Sounds like it was.

1101
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:23.189
You weren't there.

1102
00:55:23.276 --> 00:55:24.712
No. which is too bad

1103
00:55:24.756 --> 00:55:26.279
because that would've
been interesting.

1104
00:55:27.628 --> 00:55:29.326
I did go over the store
with a fine-tooth comb

1105
00:55:29.413 --> 00:55:31.371
and couldn't find
the coin either.

1106
00:55:31.458 --> 00:55:33.460
You sure he didn't take it?

1107
00:55:33.547 --> 00:55:35.114
I don't know.

1108
00:55:35.201 --> 00:55:35.984
Wait. do you think he took it?

1109
00:55:36.071 --> 00:55:38.160
No.

1110
00:55:38.247 --> 00:55:41.120
I'm totally frazzled and
not thinking straight.

1111
00:55:41.207 --> 00:55:42.339
What do I do?

1112
00:55:42.382 --> 00:55:44.602
About the coin or Jonah?

1113
00:55:44.689 --> 00:55:45.646
Both.

1114
00:55:45.733 --> 00:55:47.561
Well. to start. maybe apologize.

1115
00:55:47.648 --> 00:55:48.649
I tried.

1116
00:55:48.736 --> 00:55:50.956
He was upset. understandably so.

1117
00:55:51.043 --> 00:55:52.871
Yeah. I get that.

1118
00:55:52.958 --> 00:55:55.613
I hurt him though.

1119
00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:57.832
And it helped having the
extra set of eyes and ears

1120
00:55:57.919 --> 00:56:00.792
for the letter and the
yearbooks. yearbooks.

1121
00:56:00.879 --> 00:56:02.707
What about them?

1122
00:56:02.794 --> 00:56:06.406
I was supposed to return
them to the librarian.

1123
00:56:06.493 --> 00:56:08.365
She is not gonna
be happy with me.

1124
00:56:08.408 --> 00:56:11.846
I'm sure she'll be fine.

1125
00:56:11.933 --> 00:56:18.026
I don't even have all the books.

1126
00:56:25.164 --> 00:56:26.034
Hi.

1127
00:56:26.121 --> 00:56:28.080
Hi.

1128
00:56:28.167 --> 00:56:31.562
I realized I never returned
the yearbooks today

1129
00:56:31.649 --> 00:56:36.001
back to the schools. I've
just finished my part.

1130
00:56:36.088 --> 00:56:38.003
Did you find anything?

1131
00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:42.399
No. the librarian
at Everett High

1132
00:56:42.486 --> 00:56:47.012
was especially anxious. I
should get those back to her.

1133
00:56:47.099 --> 00:56:47.926
I think you have those ones?

1134
00:56:48.013 --> 00:56:51.320
I haven't finished yet.

1135
00:56:51.364 --> 00:56:53.061
I'm driving by the high
school for work tomorrow.

1136
00:56:53.105 --> 00:56:55.063
so I can drop 'em off.

1137
00:56:55.150 --> 00:56:57.065
You don't have to do that.

1138
00:56:57.152 --> 00:56:59.067
It's fine.

1139
00:56:59.111 --> 00:57:05.117
Okay. thanks.

1140
00:57:05.204 --> 00:57:06.901
Well. my food's probably
burning up on the stove.

1141
00:57:06.988 --> 00:57:09.034
so I've gotta go.

1142
00:57:09.121 --> 00:57:11.689
Right. see you later.

1143
00:57:11.776 --> 00:57:27.922
Yeah.

1144
00:57:28.009 --> 00:57:29.271
Those are late.

1145
00:57:29.358 --> 00:57:30.882
I know. we're really sorry.

1146
00:57:30.969 --> 00:57:32.100
She promised.

1147
00:57:32.187 --> 00:57:34.755
Yeah. well. it took longer

1148
00:57:34.842 --> 00:57:35.887
to go through than we thought.

1149
00:57:35.974 --> 00:57:37.497
I actually have a few
more I need to go through.

1150
00:57:37.584 --> 00:57:40.587
Do you mind if I just
sit down while I finish?

1151
00:57:40.674 --> 00:57:42.110
I have a class
coming in here soon.

1152
00:57:42.197 --> 00:57:45.810
I'll go as fast as I can.

1153
00:57:45.897 --> 00:57:48.029
Fine. but make sure
your cell phone is off.

1154
00:57:48.116 --> 00:57:50.510
You got it.

1155
00:58:09.529 --> 00:58:33.858
Victor Franklin.

1156
00:58:33.945 --> 00:58:34.946
What are you doing?

1157
00:58:35.033 --> 00:58:36.034
Going over the
war records again.

1158
00:58:36.121 --> 00:58:38.036
Maybe you're putting
too much pressure

1159
00:58:38.123 --> 00:58:39.167
on yourself with this thing?

1160
00:58:39.254 --> 00:58:40.517
I am not giving up.

1161
00:58:40.604 --> 00:58:44.085
I know. but finding Judith
could be special any time.

1162
00:58:44.172 --> 00:58:46.610
You should stop so you
can enjoy Christmas.

1163
00:58:46.697 --> 00:58:49.961
I am. I ordered myself
something online last night.

1164
00:58:50.048 --> 00:58:51.484
It'll arrive Christmas Eve.

1165
00:58:51.571 --> 00:58:53.617
Yeah. that's the spirit.

1166
00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:56.097
It's not a bad thing
to stay busy anyway.

1167
00:58:56.184 --> 00:58:57.011
It is when you're trying
to distract yourself

1168
00:58:57.098 --> 00:59:00.885
from the real problem.

1169
00:59:00.972 --> 00:59:02.626
I keep thinking maybe
there is something

1170
00:59:02.713 --> 00:59:07.544
that I have missed.

1171
00:59:07.631 --> 00:59:15.029
I don't know. something in
the letter perhaps.

1172
00:59:15.073 --> 00:59:16.030
Gabby?

1173
00:59:16.074 --> 00:59:16.988
What?

1174
00:59:17.075 --> 00:59:19.686
I need a flashlight.

1175
00:59:19.773 --> 00:59:28.260
Um. here.

1176
00:59:28.303 --> 00:59:29.522
What is it?

1177
00:59:39.837 --> 00:59:41.229
It was here!

1178
00:59:41.316 --> 00:59:42.491
Okay. when I checked everywhere.

1179
00:59:42.579 --> 00:59:45.059
I guess I missed that spot.

1180
00:59:45.146 --> 00:59:46.321
Me too.

1181
00:59:46.408 --> 00:59:51.152
Guess that means Jonah
really is in the clear.

1182
00:59:56.941 --> 00:59:57.985
Jonah!

1183
00:59:58.072 --> 00:59:59.813
Hi.

1184
00:59:59.857 --> 01:00:04.252
Hi. thanks for meeting me here.

1185
01:00:04.339 --> 01:00:09.344
I have something to show you.

1186
01:00:09.431 --> 01:00:10.171
Yeah.

1187
01:00:10.258 --> 01:00:13.087
It fell in the floor vent.

1188
01:00:13.174 --> 01:00:16.438
Glad you found it.

1189
01:00:16.525 --> 01:00:19.050
Me too.

1190
01:00:19.137 --> 01:00:20.834
I never should've suggested

1191
01:00:20.921 --> 01:00:26.623
you had anything to
do with it being lost.

1192
01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:31.715
I took the books back
to Everett High School.

1193
01:00:31.802 --> 01:00:33.194
Merry Christmas. Mandy.

1194
01:00:33.281 --> 01:00:41.028
What's this?

1195
01:00:41.072 --> 01:00:43.640
"Mrs. Reeves. our
favorite English teacher

1196
01:00:43.727 --> 01:00:45.946
"with Senior Victor Franklin

1197
01:00:46.033 --> 01:00:56.740
"and his cousin.
Sophomore Judith Lewis."

1198
01:01:01.266 --> 01:01:05.226
So it has to be her.
what's next then?

1199
01:01:05.313 --> 01:01:08.534
I find everything I
can on Judith Lewis.

1200
01:01:08.577 --> 01:01:11.624
Great. how?

1201
01:01:11.711 --> 01:01:14.671
Her father. you don't have
plans tonight. do you?

1202
01:01:14.714 --> 01:01:15.802
Well. no. but I was--

1203
01:01:15.889 --> 01:01:17.108
Great. come on over and
I'll make us dinner.

1204
01:01:17.195 --> 01:01:19.980
Lucky me.

1205
01:01:20.067 --> 01:01:23.375
♪ Silent night. holy night ♪

1206
01:01:23.418 --> 01:01:25.377
Have you seen these war records?

1207
01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:26.552
All these soldiers.

1208
01:01:26.639 --> 01:01:32.384
I know. it reminds me of
Judith and her family.

1209
01:01:32.471 --> 01:01:36.257
the Christmas that
she wrote the letter.

1210
01:01:36.301 --> 01:01:38.346
Oh. here's a Lewis.

1211
01:01:38.433 --> 01:01:40.348
Really. I just found one too!

1212
01:01:40.435 --> 01:01:42.263
Paul Lewis.

1213
01:01:42.350 --> 01:01:43.308
Nathan Lewis.

1214
01:01:43.395 --> 01:01:45.179
Okay. I guess I
shouldn't be surprised

1215
01:01:45.266 --> 01:01:47.529
that there is more
than one Lewis.

1216
01:01:47.573 --> 01:01:48.748
Should we make a pile?

1217
01:01:48.835 --> 01:01:52.186
Yes.

1218
01:01:52.273 --> 01:01:54.014
I didn't think
you'd get this far.

1219
01:01:54.101 --> 01:01:57.365
I wouldn't have. not
without Jonah at least.

1220
01:01:57.452 --> 01:02:00.020
and you of course.

1221
01:02:00.107 --> 01:02:02.719
Of course.

1222
01:02:02.806 --> 01:02:06.113
It was nice of him to
give you what he found.

1223
01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:08.246
Yeah.

1224
01:02:08.333 --> 01:02:11.162
Are you mad at him?

1225
01:02:11.249 --> 01:02:14.469
No. it's more the
other way around.

1226
01:02:14.513 --> 01:02:17.603
I think I let it
become too much.

1227
01:02:17.646 --> 01:02:18.386
It?

1228
01:02:18.473 --> 01:02:23.391
Our relationship. friendship.

1229
01:02:23.435 --> 01:02:27.004
acquaintances. really.

1230
01:02:27.091 --> 01:02:28.309
He was just a nice stranger

1231
01:02:28.353 --> 01:02:30.747
who helped me for
a little while.

1232
01:02:30.790 --> 01:02:32.444
Nice-looking stranger.

1233
01:02:32.487 --> 01:02:33.880
Does it matter?

1234
01:02:33.967 --> 01:02:35.969
Depends on how you feel.

1235
01:02:36.013 --> 01:02:38.319
It's out of my control.

1236
01:02:38.363 --> 01:02:41.670
He has his life.
and I have mine.

1237
01:02:41.758 --> 01:02:45.805
And they're not going in
the same direction anymore.

1238
01:02:45.892 --> 01:02:47.285
And besides. it's Christmas!

1239
01:02:47.328 --> 01:02:49.940
We should focus on that.

1240
01:02:49.983 --> 01:02:52.464
Oh. and this.

1241
01:02:52.551 --> 01:03:00.254
found another one. Colin Lewis.

1242
01:03:00.341 --> 01:03:03.910
Hey. Jonah. how are you?

1243
01:03:03.997 --> 01:03:08.175
Good. thanks. moving
along well here.

1244
01:03:08.262 --> 01:03:10.787
Can hardly wait to
clean up all the dust.

1245
01:03:10.874 --> 01:03:12.745
Yeah. it gets
frustrating I'm sure.

1246
01:03:12.832 --> 01:03:14.616
Well. as eager as I am

1247
01:03:14.703 --> 01:03:16.749
to see the church
back in operation.

1248
01:03:16.836 --> 01:03:20.231
make sure you get some
rest. okay. enjoy Christmas.

1249
01:03:20.318 --> 01:03:21.885
I will. thanks.

1250
01:03:21.972 --> 01:03:23.843
Oh. this is for you.

1251
01:03:23.887 --> 01:03:25.453
What's this?

1252
01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:29.022
It's the balance of what
I owe you for your work.

1253
01:03:29.066 --> 01:03:30.241
I'm not done. you
don't have to--

1254
01:03:30.328 --> 01:03:34.723
I know. I figured
you could use it.

1255
01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:38.249
I. uh. thank you.

1256
01:03:38.336 --> 01:03:40.294
Merry Christmas.

1257
01:03:40.381 --> 01:03:47.606
Hey. Pastor. how did you know?

1258
01:03:47.693 --> 01:03:49.782
A beautiful angel told me.

1259
01:04:30.823 --> 01:04:33.478
"This is one of the few
spy novels I've read.

1260
01:04:33.565 --> 01:04:36.220
"It's a first edition.
which seems less impressive

1261
01:04:36.307 --> 01:04:38.570
"since it was published
just a couple of years ago.

1262
01:04:38.657 --> 01:04:41.529
"It's not my usual vintage
find. but I loved it.

1263
01:04:41.616 --> 01:04:57.110
"I hope you will too. Mandy."

1264
01:04:57.154 --> 01:04:59.025
Merry Christmas. what
can I do for you?

1265
01:04:59.112 --> 01:05:02.594
Hi. I am trying to track down
a woman named Judith Lewis.

1266
01:05:02.681 --> 01:05:04.770
would've been born
in the late 1930s.

1267
01:05:04.813 --> 01:05:05.597
Oh. I remember you.

1268
01:05:05.684 --> 01:05:08.339
Yep. I've made progress though.

1269
01:05:08.426 --> 01:05:10.428
I know her dad is
one of these men.

1270
01:05:10.471 --> 01:05:11.995
Well. is she deceased?

1271
01:05:12.082 --> 01:05:14.823
I don't know. could we
check for a birth record?

1272
01:05:14.911 --> 01:05:17.174
No. that's private
information reserved

1273
01:05:17.217 --> 01:05:20.394
for family members. which
I assume you are not.

1274
01:05:20.481 --> 01:05:25.443
What else could I look for
to narrow down who she is?

1275
01:05:25.530 --> 01:05:32.058
Please. this is a matter of at
least sentimental importance.

1276
01:05:32.145 --> 01:05:35.670
Well. you could look
up a marriage license.

1277
01:05:35.757 --> 01:05:36.410
if you know the father's name.

1278
01:05:36.497 --> 01:05:38.369
they list that on the records.

1279
01:05:38.456 --> 01:05:41.676
Even if he is deceased at
the time of the marriage?

1280
01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:44.984
Yep. better hurry though.
we're closing early today

1281
01:05:45.071 --> 01:05:47.378
and then we don't
reopen until the 26th.

1282
01:05:47.465 --> 01:05:49.989
What do we do?

1283
01:05:51.251 --> 01:05:55.952
All right. I'm narrowing
the search to marriages

1284
01:05:55.995 --> 01:05:58.867
in the 1950s to '70s.

1285
01:05:58.911 --> 01:06:01.479
Give me the name of
the first father.

1286
01:06:01.522 --> 01:06:04.917
Paul Lewis.

1287
01:06:05.004 --> 01:06:08.660
He's listed under the
marriages of two children.

1288
01:06:08.747 --> 01:06:10.401
Dorothy and Samuel.

1289
01:06:10.488 --> 01:06:16.407
Nope. try Nathan Lewis next.

1290
01:06:16.494 --> 01:06:20.019
Father of Joan.

1291
01:06:20.106 --> 01:06:21.325
Any other children?

1292
01:06:21.368 --> 01:06:23.675
Nope. give me another.

1293
01:06:23.718 --> 01:06:30.682
Okay. Donald Lewis died in 1942.

1294
01:06:30.769 --> 01:06:33.206
Nothing under that name.

1295
01:06:33.293 --> 01:06:40.605
Okay. try Colin Lewis next.

1296
01:06:40.692 --> 01:06:47.090
He's listed under one
marriage for Judith Lewis.

1297
01:06:47.177 --> 01:06:50.528
Really. Judith Lewis?

1298
01:06:50.615 --> 01:06:53.835
Married in 1957
to William Cross.

1299
01:06:53.879 --> 01:06:55.228
You want a copy of this?

1300
01:06:57.665 --> 01:06:58.579
You gonna pass out or something?

1301
01:06:58.623 --> 01:07:01.408
No. no. I am fine.

1302
01:07:01.495 --> 01:07:12.332
and yes. I would love a copy!

1303
01:07:14.465 --> 01:07:18.121
Oh. excuse me. merry Christmas.

1304
01:07:18.208 --> 01:07:19.078
I found her.

1305
01:07:19.165 --> 01:07:20.297
Seriously?

1306
01:07:20.384 --> 01:07:22.473
Yep. her dad is Colin.
her mother is Ruth.

1307
01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:27.304
and Judith married a
William Cross; it's her.

1308
01:07:27.391 --> 01:07:28.522
You're sure?

1309
01:07:28.609 --> 01:07:30.307
I checked all the Lewis
soldiers just to be safe.

1310
01:07:30.394 --> 01:07:32.135
and she's the only one.

1311
01:07:32.222 --> 01:07:33.614
And she's still alive?

1312
01:07:33.658 --> 01:07:36.095
I even asked the clerk for
a possible death certificate

1313
01:07:36.182 --> 01:07:38.967
for Judith. and there is none.

1314
01:07:39.011 --> 01:07:40.882
The clerk was about to toss
me out by the time I left.

1315
01:07:40.969 --> 01:07:45.017
I think she had an office
Christmas party to get to.

1316
01:07:45.104 --> 01:07:47.411
Wow. this is her.

1317
01:07:47.454 --> 01:07:48.542
I know.

1318
01:07:48.629 --> 01:07:52.024
So Judith Cross. you
just have to find her.

1319
01:07:52.111 --> 01:07:53.721
Yeah.

1320
01:07:53.808 --> 01:07:56.246
It's the 23rd of December.

1321
01:07:56.333 --> 01:07:59.336
I know. I have a
lot of work to do.

1322
01:07:59.423 --> 01:07:59.901
Guess that means you
could use some help

1323
01:07:59.988 --> 01:08:01.642
till closing time?

1324
01:08:01.729 --> 01:08:02.774
Is that okay?

1325
01:08:02.861 --> 01:08:04.863
I would've made up an
excuse if it wasn't.

1326
01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:05.472
You are the best!

1327
01:08:05.516 --> 01:08:07.387
I will be at home.

1328
01:08:07.474 --> 01:08:08.780
I'll come over after
I close up here.

1329
01:08:08.823 --> 01:08:13.263
Thank you!

1330
01:08:13.350 --> 01:08:17.658
No. it's okay. it sounds like
I have the wrong Judith Cross.

1331
01:08:17.745 --> 01:08:18.442
Thanks for chatting though.

1332
01:08:18.529 --> 01:08:24.709
Okay. buh-bye.

1333
01:08:24.796 --> 01:08:26.189
How many more?

1334
01:08:26.276 --> 01:08:29.192
Keeping it within the county.
I'm looking at three more.

1335
01:08:29.279 --> 01:08:31.629
Beyond that. well. let's just
hope she's like most people

1336
01:08:31.672 --> 01:08:34.545
in the area and loves it here.

1337
01:08:34.632 --> 01:08:35.676
So when you find her--

1338
01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:39.550
Oh. I like how
optimistic you are now!

1339
01:08:39.637 --> 01:08:43.641
Are you gonna tell
Jonah about her?

1340
01:08:43.728 --> 01:08:45.208
Would you?

1341
01:08:45.295 --> 01:08:47.166
Yeah.

1342
01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:49.647
I want to. I'll
agonize over that

1343
01:08:49.734 --> 01:08:54.521
after I've found the
right Judith Cross.

1344
01:08:54.565 --> 01:08:57.829
Ugh. voicemail.

1345
01:08:57.872 --> 01:09:01.528
Hi. I'm Mandy. I'm
looking for Judith Cross.

1346
01:09:01.572 --> 01:09:02.573
I found something
that belongs to her.

1347
01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:05.532
but I'm not sure if I
have the right person.

1348
01:09:05.619 --> 01:09:06.533
If you could call me back.

1349
01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:12.539
I would really
appreciate it. thank you.

1350
01:09:12.583 --> 01:09:16.152
What are you doing for
Christmas Eve tomorrow?

1351
01:09:16.239 --> 01:09:19.416
I think I'm just gonna have
a quiet night to myself.

1352
01:09:19.503 --> 01:09:23.028
maybe watch a movie.
actually use the fireplace.

1353
01:09:23.071 --> 01:09:25.030
Sounds cozy.

1354
01:09:25.073 --> 01:09:26.249
And Christmas Day?

1355
01:09:26.336 --> 01:09:30.078
Maybe I'll make it a movie
marathon that day too.

1356
01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:31.602
You could come hang out
with me and my family.

1357
01:09:31.689 --> 01:09:35.083
You do not have to do that.

1358
01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:39.000
I'm just saying you might
want a break and some company.

1359
01:09:39.087 --> 01:09:41.002
I'm pathetic. aren't I?

1360
01:09:41.046 --> 01:09:42.569
I purposely did not say that!

1361
01:09:42.656 --> 01:09:44.919
This is the first
time you've held back.

1362
01:09:44.963 --> 01:09:46.747
that's how I know it's
a sympathy invitation.

1363
01:09:46.834 --> 01:09:48.706
Fine. but promise me.

1364
01:09:48.793 --> 01:09:51.622
if you feel like it.
you'll come over?

1365
01:09:51.709 --> 01:09:55.539
Okay. thank you.

1366
01:10:17.256 --> 01:10:18.083
Hello?

1367
01:10:18.170 --> 01:10:19.998
Hi. we got a call
from this number

1368
01:10:20.085 --> 01:10:23.480
about something that
belongs to my mother?

1369
01:10:23.567 --> 01:10:27.048
Your mother. is
she Judith Cross?

1370
01:10:27.135 --> 01:10:28.136
Yes.

1371
01:10:28.224 --> 01:10:31.531
Hi. yes. thank you
for calling me back.

1372
01:11:27.848 --> 01:11:29.676
Hey. Mom.

1373
01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:31.678
Merry Christmas Eve!

1374
01:11:31.722 --> 01:11:33.332
Are you ready for Christmas?

1375
01:11:33.419 --> 01:11:35.726
Me. you're the one
doing all the work.

1376
01:11:35.813 --> 01:11:37.205
I can't tell you how nice it is

1377
01:11:37.249 --> 01:11:38.685
not to worry about
cooking this year.

1378
01:11:38.729 --> 01:11:41.166
Yeah. well. you just relax.

1379
01:11:41.253 --> 01:11:42.733
I have everything planned.

1380
01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:44.604
Good. now don't forget

1381
01:11:44.691 --> 01:11:47.346
to thaw the turkey in
advance. or the ham.

1382
01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:48.565
What are we having?

1383
01:11:48.652 --> 01:11:50.915
Ham. and I'll make sure
that it's thawed and warm

1384
01:11:51.002 --> 01:11:51.872
by the time you get here.

1385
01:11:51.916 --> 01:11:55.659
Is your friend still coming?

1386
01:11:55.746 --> 01:11:56.834
Um. I'm not sure.

1387
01:11:56.921 --> 01:11:59.967
She may have had
something come up.

1388
01:12:00.011 --> 01:12:01.360
Come up?

1389
01:12:01.404 --> 01:12:03.231
It's Christmas.

1390
01:12:03.275 --> 01:12:04.363
Yeah. well. you don't
have to worry about that.

1391
01:12:04.450 --> 01:12:08.498
You just drive safely and
I'll see you here tomorrow.

1392
01:12:08.541 --> 01:12:11.022
All right now. love you.

1393
01:12:11.109 --> 01:12:11.718
Love you too.

1394
01:12:40.747 --> 01:12:42.096
Oh!

1395
01:12:42.183 --> 01:12:43.620
Mandy.

1396
01:12:43.707 --> 01:12:44.708
Sorry. I was about to knock.

1397
01:12:44.795 --> 01:12:48.102
I wasn't expecting you.

1398
01:12:48.146 --> 01:12:50.801
No. no. I just thought
I would stop by.

1399
01:12:50.888 --> 01:12:56.633
Here. I thought maybe you
could use this for tomorrow.

1400
01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:59.897
Wow. thank you.

1401
01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:00.680
I was--
I--

1402
01:13:00.767 --> 01:13:02.813
Sorry. go ahead.

1403
01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:05.206
Well. the pastor at the church.

1404
01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:07.426
he paid me ahead of schedule.

1405
01:13:07.513 --> 01:13:12.649
I was wondering if?

1406
01:13:12.736 --> 01:13:13.432
That was you.

1407
01:13:13.519 --> 01:13:16.870
Sorry. shouldn't have meddled.

1408
01:13:16.957 --> 01:13:17.828
It was the best thing
I could think to do

1409
01:13:17.915 --> 01:13:22.789
to make things better.

1410
01:13:22.833 --> 01:13:24.487
Thank you.

1411
01:13:24.574 --> 01:13:25.749
Well. it was the pastor.

1412
01:13:25.836 --> 01:13:31.102
Thanks for caring though.

1413
01:13:31.145 --> 01:13:33.104
I found Judith.

1414
01:13:33.147 --> 01:13:34.279
Oh. you did?

1415
01:13:34.366 --> 01:13:36.934
Yeah. I'm on my way there now.

1416
01:13:37.021 --> 01:13:41.678
I thought maybe you'd
like to come with?

1417
01:13:41.765 --> 01:13:44.376
Well. I've got some
last-minute Christmas errands

1418
01:13:44.463 --> 01:13:45.159
I really need to--

1419
01:13:45.246 --> 01:13:45.943
Yeah. of course.

1420
01:13:46.030 --> 01:13:50.904
I just thought I'd check.

1421
01:13:50.991 --> 01:13:54.778
Do you want me to come?

1422
01:13:54.865 --> 01:14:02.307
Yes. I do.

1423
01:14:02.350 --> 01:14:04.527
I didn't tell you everything

1424
01:14:04.614 --> 01:14:07.747
that I put in my
letter to Santa.

1425
01:14:07.834 --> 01:14:10.184
What do you mean?

1426
01:14:10.271 --> 01:14:13.797
Well. I asked that
I would find Judith.

1427
01:14:13.884 --> 01:14:17.365
but I also asked that you and I

1428
01:14:17.453 --> 01:14:23.633
could give her the
letter together.

1429
01:14:23.676 --> 01:14:37.995
Well. let me put
this in the fridge.

1430
01:14:38.038 --> 01:14:44.741
All right. you ready?

1431
01:14:48.658 --> 01:14:49.659
Yes?

1432
01:14:49.746 --> 01:14:52.009
Hi. I'm Mandy. we
spoke on the phone.

1433
01:14:52.096 --> 01:14:55.403
Oh yes. my mom. she
just took my kids

1434
01:14:55.447 --> 01:14:57.188
down to the town square
for the tree lighting.

1435
01:14:57.275 --> 01:15:00.844
I tried to stop her. but I
didn't wanna give away why.

1436
01:15:00.931 --> 01:15:02.976
Should we wait here?

1437
01:15:03.063 --> 01:15:04.108
I don't know how
long they'll be.

1438
01:15:04.195 --> 01:15:08.721
If you don't mind. I'm
sure they're easy to find.

1439
01:15:20.385 --> 01:15:22.300
Her daughter said
she was wearing

1440
01:15:22.387 --> 01:15:25.651
a dark blue coat
with a pink scarf.

1441
01:15:25.738 --> 01:15:30.047
Hmm. okay.

1442
01:15:30.090 --> 01:15:32.658
How about right there?

1443
01:15:32.745 --> 01:15:34.268
No pink scarf.

1444
01:15:34.355 --> 01:15:38.577
Yeah.

1445
01:15:38.664 --> 01:15:43.060
How about. no.

1446
01:15:45.802 --> 01:15:47.151
Well. come on. let's
go look over here.

1447
01:15:47.238 --> 01:15:51.198
Okay.

1448
01:15:51.285 --> 01:15:52.983
Maybe we should split up?

1449
01:15:53.070 --> 01:15:54.593
Yeah. good idea.

1450
01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:58.466
Okay.

1451
01:16:21.141 --> 01:16:29.802
Hmm.

1452
01:16:29.846 --> 01:16:30.542
Good evening. everyone.

1453
01:16:30.629 --> 01:16:32.500
In just 15 minutes we'll have

1454
01:16:32.544 --> 01:16:35.634
our grand Christmas Eve
tree lighting ceremony.

1455
01:16:36.983 --> 01:16:37.723
Any luck?

1456
01:16:37.810 --> 01:16:39.290
No. you?

1457
01:16:39.377 --> 01:16:42.119
No.

1458
01:16:42.206 --> 01:16:43.903
Could we have missed her?

1459
01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:45.513
I don't know. it is
getting cold out.

1460
01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:50.170
Maybe they went back early?

1461
01:16:50.257 --> 01:16:54.740
Wait. look!

1462
01:16:54.827 --> 01:16:55.349
Have you seen him?

1463
01:16:55.436 --> 01:16:56.786
Yeah.
He was right

1464
01:16:56.829 --> 01:16:58.657
over there somewhere.

1465
01:16:58.701 --> 01:16:59.440
Okay. let's just go.

1466
01:16:59.484 --> 01:17:02.052
Live reindeer.

1467
01:17:02.139 --> 01:17:07.361
Let's go!

1468
01:17:08.493 --> 01:17:12.323
Excuse me. are you Judith Cross?

1469
01:17:12.410 --> 01:17:15.674
Yes. yes I am.

1470
01:17:24.248 --> 01:17:27.120
Why don't the two of you find
something warm to drink. okay?

1471
01:17:27.207 --> 01:17:29.557
All right.
Okay. thank you. Grandma!

1472
01:17:29.601 --> 01:17:33.126
Be right back!

1473
01:17:33.170 --> 01:17:35.476
So you're Mandy?

1474
01:17:35.563 --> 01:17:38.349
Yes. and this is Jonah.

1475
01:17:38.436 --> 01:17:41.047
We have been looking for you

1476
01:17:41.134 --> 01:17:42.832
to return something
that's yours.

1477
01:17:45.399 --> 01:17:48.968
What's this?

1478
01:17:49.055 --> 01:17:52.058
Christmas isn't until
tomorrow. you know.

1479
01:17:52.145 --> 01:17:53.973
I couldn't wait till then.

1480
01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:55.671
Please. go ahead and open it.

1481
01:17:55.758 --> 01:17:59.022
All right then. well. don't
tell my grandchildren.

1482
01:17:59.065 --> 01:18:01.285
they'll wanna open up
everything tonight.

1483
01:18:01.372 --> 01:18:03.461
You know. kids. no
matter what age they are.

1484
01:18:03.548 --> 01:18:05.550
they're excited for presents.

1485
01:18:08.335 --> 01:18:10.903
When you were a young girl.

1486
01:18:10.947 --> 01:18:14.864
do you remember writing
letters to Santa?

1487
01:18:14.951 --> 01:18:16.996
Sure. I wrote many.

1488
01:18:17.083 --> 01:18:20.347
And there was this one
time when you wrote to him.

1489
01:18:20.434 --> 01:18:22.219
not to ask something
for yourself.

1490
01:18:22.306 --> 01:18:28.181
but for him to give a
gift to someone else?

1491
01:18:28.268 --> 01:18:33.839
My father!

1492
01:18:33.926 --> 01:18:37.364
Victor's book.

1493
01:18:37.451 --> 01:18:40.672
Jonah and I came
across the book.

1494
01:18:40.759 --> 01:18:42.718
and this letter was inside it.

1495
01:18:42.761 --> 01:18:45.068
Oh!

1496
01:18:45.155 --> 01:18:47.200
Oh. look at my handwriting!

1497
01:18:47.287 --> 01:18:49.072
As soon as I read it.

1498
01:18:49.159 --> 01:18:51.030
I knew it was something
you'd want back.

1499
01:18:51.117 --> 01:18:51.596
Oh.

1500
01:18:51.639 --> 01:19:00.518
And the coin too.

1501
01:19:00.605 --> 01:19:06.132
I found this silver dollar
after my father died.

1502
01:19:06.219 --> 01:19:10.354
I knew he would love
it for his collection.

1503
01:19:10.441 --> 01:19:13.705
I missed him so much.

1504
01:19:13.792 --> 01:19:16.447
I thought that if anyone
could give it to my father.

1505
01:19:16.534 --> 01:19:19.276
it would be Santa.

1506
01:19:19.363 --> 01:19:24.237
Well. it's worth a decent
amount of money now.

1507
01:19:24.324 --> 01:19:26.413
You're gonna wanna
keep that safe.

1508
01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:31.288
Thank you!

1509
01:19:31.375 --> 01:19:40.732
This is so amazing. oh.

1510
01:19:43.343 --> 01:19:47.043
"Dear Santa.

1511
01:19:47.130 --> 01:19:49.915
"I have been good all year.

1512
01:19:50.002 --> 01:19:52.265
"and tried to help my mother.

1513
01:19:52.352 --> 01:19:55.616
"I know we won't have
much for Christmas.

1514
01:19:55.703 --> 01:20:01.622
"That is just fine by me.
but could you help me?

1515
01:20:01.709 --> 01:20:04.408
"I found a coin I think
my father would like.

1516
01:20:04.495 --> 01:20:07.977
"He died in the war though.

1517
01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:09.369
"For Christmas this
year. could my present

1518
01:20:09.413 --> 01:20:16.028
"be you giving
this to my father?

1519
01:20:16.115 --> 01:20:20.032
"He liked collecting these.

1520
01:20:20.076 --> 01:20:22.948
"I miss him.

1521
01:20:23.035 --> 01:20:31.957
"and I know he would love it."

1522
01:20:32.044 --> 01:20:36.048
Thank you.

1523
01:20:36.135 --> 01:20:42.838
Thank you so much.

1524
01:20:42.881 --> 01:20:44.187
We welcome you all out

1525
01:20:44.274 --> 01:20:47.407
to this special Christmas
Eve tree lighting ceremony.

1526
01:20:47.451 --> 01:20:48.669
We're so proud of our community

1527
01:20:48.756 --> 01:20:53.544
and look forward to spending
this special time with you.

1528
01:20:53.631 --> 01:20:56.721
Thank you for
bringing me with you.

1529
01:20:56.808 --> 01:20:59.898
This wouldn't have
happened without you.

1530
01:20:59.942 --> 01:21:02.031
I think you would've
found a way.

1531
01:21:02.118 --> 01:21:06.035
You believed in this
and how special it was.

1532
01:21:06.122 --> 01:21:07.297
You wouldn't have given up.

1533
01:21:07.384 --> 01:21:09.125
I don't know.

1534
01:21:09.168 --> 01:21:12.606
but it was certainly
better having you involved.

1535
01:21:12.693 --> 01:21:14.304
Well. maybe faster.

1536
01:21:14.391 --> 01:21:15.740
More fun.

1537
01:21:15.827 --> 01:21:18.395
I don't think the
librarian would agree.

1538
01:21:18.482 --> 01:21:23.400
Oh!

1539
01:21:23.487 --> 01:21:29.319
Why did you volunteer to help
me that day at the church?

1540
01:21:29.406 --> 01:21:31.364
Nobody would've
given that letter

1541
01:21:31.451 --> 01:21:34.019
a second thought like you did.

1542
01:21:34.106 --> 01:21:35.499
They might've thrown it away.

1543
01:21:35.586 --> 01:21:39.242
told a friend about
it as a cute story.

1544
01:21:39.329 --> 01:21:46.075
gotten rich off the
coin. but not you.

1545
01:21:46.162 --> 01:21:48.468
Not you either.

1546
01:21:48.512 --> 01:21:49.382
And no one else
would've helped me.

1547
01:21:49.469 --> 01:21:53.560
Yeah they would have.

1548
01:21:53.647 --> 01:21:57.086
if they saw what I see in you.

1549
01:21:57.129 --> 01:21:59.044
It's the time you've
all been waiting for!

1550
01:21:59.131 --> 01:22:02.613
Now count down with me as
we light our glorious tree!

1551
01:22:03.962 --> 01:22:08.271
Do you wanna know what I
put in my letter to Santa?

1552
01:22:08.358 --> 01:22:09.663
What?

1553
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:12.666
I asked for you to love me.

1554
01:22:12.753 --> 01:22:15.191
Five. four.

1555
01:22:15.278 --> 01:22:20.979
three. two. one!

1556
01:22:21.066 --> 01:22:21.458
Merry Christmas. everyone!

1557
01:22:34.384 --> 01:22:37.909
Looks like we both got
our Christmas wishes.

1558
01:22:37.996 --> 01:22:43.219
Merry Christmas.

1559
01:22:43.306 --> 01:22:45.351
You still coming to my house
for dinner tomorrow night?

1560
01:22:45.438 --> 01:22:46.439
I would love to.

1561
01:22:46.483 --> 01:22:47.701
Good.

1562
01:22:47.788 --> 01:22:51.401
Have you even started on
any of the recipes yet?

1563
01:22:51.488 --> 01:22:52.489
I haven't even gone
to the grocery store.

1564
01:22:52.532 --> 01:22:55.883
At least we have pie.
