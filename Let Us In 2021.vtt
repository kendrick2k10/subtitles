Oh. we're not interested.

539
00:29:49.019 --> 00:29:52.053
We already receive
the Daily News. but thank you.

540
00:29:52.088 --> 00:29:53.956
-Thank you very much.
-Yeah. no. no. no.

541
00:29:53.991 --> 00:29:56.827
Um. I'm sorry. I'm not
selling subscriptions. ma'am.

542
00:29:56.862 --> 00:29:59.830
I'm a journalist with the Times.

543
00:29:59.865 --> 00:30:02.459
I'm writing a story
about the kidnappings.

544
00:30:08.401 --> 00:30:11.600
To date. there have been...

545
00:30:11.635 --> 00:30:13.602
three missing persons.

546
00:30:13.637 --> 00:30:16.506
all in the course
of just one week.

547
00:30:16.541 --> 00:30:18.948
all of whom are teenagers.

548
00:30:18.983 --> 00:30:23.953
And there's been no trace
of any evidence.

549
00:30:23.988 --> 00:30:26.582
Except for
a single eyewitness

550
00:30:26.617 --> 00:30:30.960
who saw a group of kids
wearing black hoodies.

551
00:30:30.995 --> 00:30:32.929
It was brought to my attention

552
00:30:32.964 --> 00:30:36.427
that you were the victim
of an attempted robbery

553
00:30:36.462 --> 00:30:40.101
involving a group of young kids
wearing black hoodies.

554
00:30:41.005 --> 00:30:42.939
Yet you managed to escape.

555
00:30:42.974 --> 00:30:43.907
Is that true?

556
00:30:45.636 --> 00:30:48.879
I think we ought
to wrap this up now. Mr. Lutz.

557
00:30:48.914 --> 00:30:51.948
Emily has to study
for an exam tomorrow. and she--

558
00:30:51.983 --> 00:30:53.180
[Emily] Yes. it is true.

559
00:30:56.086 --> 00:30:58.317
They kept asking me
to let them in.

560
00:31:00.486 --> 00:31:03.322
Sorry. Uh. do you mind
if I record this?

561
00:31:06.624 --> 00:31:08.261
[recorder clicks]

562
00:31:09.594 --> 00:31:11.495
All of them were teenagers?

563
00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:13.200
Yeah. I--

564
00:31:13.235 --> 00:31:16.434
Well. not all
the same age and gender.

565
00:31:16.469 --> 00:31:20.405
but they had black eyes.

566
00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:23.309
like the entire eye was black.

567
00:31:23.344 --> 00:31:26.444
And they had
extremely pale skin.

568
00:31:28.415 --> 00:31:30.052
They smelled really bad.

569
00:31:30.087 --> 00:31:33.957
like a mixture
of really old cheese and butt.

570
00:31:33.992 --> 00:31:36.289
That's. uh. vividly descriptive.

571
00:31:36.324 --> 00:31:38.621
Yeah. I'm just trying
to paint a picture for you.

572
00:31:38.656 --> 00:31:41.525
It's very helpful.

573
00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:44.363
You said that they asked you
to let them in?

574
00:31:44.398 --> 00:31:46.398
Did they mean into your home?

575
00:31:46.433 --> 00:31:48.499
Yeah. I guess.

576
00:31:50.272 --> 00:31:52.976
I don't know.

577
00:31:53.011 --> 00:31:54.978
The thing is.
this is a really small town.

578
00:31:55.013 --> 00:31:58.377
and I've never seen
kids like this before ever.

579
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:09.685
Besties pact.
We do everything together.

580
00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.093
no matter what.

581
00:32:11.128 --> 00:32:12.556
[Emily] No matter what.

582
00:32:12.591 --> 00:32:14.360
Okay. here we go.

583
00:32:14.395 --> 00:32:16.626
But you go first.
I'm still nervous.

584
00:32:16.661 --> 00:32:18.496
It'll be fine. Trust me.

585
00:32:18.531 --> 00:32:20.003
You ready?

586
00:32:20.038 --> 00:32:21.367
-Yeah.
-Here we go.

587
00:32:21.402 --> 00:32:23.435
[deep breath] One...

588
00:32:25.637 --> 00:32:27.208
two...

589
00:32:29.608 --> 00:32:31.377
three!

[machinery whirring]

593
00:32:58.571 --> 00:33:00.439
All I did was tweak
the frequency a fraction.

594
00:33:00.474 --> 00:33:03.574
and then. boom.
it was real quick.

595
00:33:03.609 --> 00:33:05.543
literally like three seconds.

596
00:33:05.578 --> 00:33:08.216
and then all the power
just shut down.

597
00:33:08.251 --> 00:33:09.613
[Emily] No offense. Christopher.

598
00:33:09.648 --> 00:33:11.450
but I don't think
a tiny movement of needles

599
00:33:11.485 --> 00:33:13.056
is proof of communication.

600
00:33:13.091 --> 00:33:15.487
Trust me. it was
nothing we've heard before.

601
00:33:17.524 --> 00:33:19.359
[transmission crackling]

602
00:33:19.394 --> 00:33:21.592
This shihizzle's for real.

603
00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:28.401
[frequencies warbling]

604
00:33:35.773 --> 00:33:38.477

[transmission fades]

608
00:33:54.165 --> 00:33:55.296
What?!

609
00:33:56.563 --> 00:33:58.695
[blows lips]
Christopher. my dear friend.

610
00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:01.500
I think that we need
to finally come to terms

611
00:34:01.535 --> 00:34:03.304
that this is probably
never gonna happen.

612
00:34:03.339 --> 00:34:04.833
What are you saying?

613
00:34:04.868 --> 00:34:07.572
I'm saying that we've put in
a great effort here.

614
00:34:07.607 --> 00:34:09.838
but I think we should try
something more realistic.

615
00:34:09.873 --> 00:34:12.181
So you're just going to quit?

616
00:34:12.216 --> 00:34:14.150
No. I'm not saying quit.

617
00:34:14.185 --> 00:34:16.680
I'm just saying we should
figure out something else.

618
00:34:16.715 --> 00:34:19.848
Emily. persistence is
science's middle name.

619
00:34:19.883 --> 00:34:21.784
You know how many times
it took Edison

620
00:34:21.819 --> 00:34:23.786
to finally invent
the light bulb?

621
00:34:23.821 --> 00:34:26.195
-Thousands.
-Yes! How'd you know?

622
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:27.625
'Cause I know everything.

623
00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:30.100
If you did. you'd realize
that we are so close

624
00:34:30.135 --> 00:34:32.234
to communicating
with whatever is out there.

625
00:34:32.269 --> 00:34:33.763
Well. what if there's
nothing out there?

626
00:34:33.798 --> 00:34:36.370
You and I both know that
there's something out there.

627
00:34:36.405 --> 00:34:38.438
and we are destined
to communicate with them.

628
00:34:38.473 --> 00:34:40.242
I stan your passion.
Christopher.

629
00:34:40.277 --> 00:34:42.772
but I think
I'm gonna cut my losses.

630
00:34:42.807 --> 00:34:46.149
Emily. come on.
You can't do this.

631
00:34:46.184 --> 00:34:48.415

640
00:35:18.216 --> 00:35:19.314
Hello.

641
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:21.877
Uh. it's me. Emily Sparks.

642
00:35:21.912 --> 00:35:24.253
coming to you from Earth.

643
00:35:24.288 --> 00:35:25.815
Uh. you probably
don't understand

644
00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:27.817
a word I'm saying
right now. but. uh.

645
00:35:27.852 --> 00:35:29.423
me and my friend Christopher

646
00:35:29.458 --> 00:35:31.392
created this
communication device

647
00:35:31.427 --> 00:35:33.889
to try to talk to aliens.
and I guess it works.

648

-[speaker squeals]
-Give 'em the Cliffnotes.

649
00:35:35.629 --> 00:35:36.595
not the novel.

650
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:38.564
Okay. Oh. you're right.

651
00:35:38.599 --> 00:35:40.170
Keep it tight. Okay.

652
00:35:40.205 --> 00:35:42.436
So. uh. tell us
a little bit about you.

-[distorted] Emily.

654
00:35:46.706 --> 00:35:47.903
Did it just say my name?!

655
00:35:47.938 --> 00:35:49.443
-It just said your name!
-Oh. my God!

656
00:35:49.478 --> 00:35:50.807
-It just said my name!
-It said your name!

657
00:35:50.842 --> 00:35:53.282

What?!

661
00:35:57.948 --> 00:35:59.948
-They just said your name?
-They just said my name!

662
00:35:59.983 --> 00:36:02.852

00:36:55.973 --> 00:36:57.709
[echoing] Will you let us in?

672
00:36:57.744 --> 00:36:59.777
Oh. I-I'm sorry.
We're actually closed.

673
00:36:59.812 --> 00:37:03.253
We open up again
tomorrow morning at 11:00.

for something cold to drink.

Uh. sorry. I already
closed the register.

677
00:37:11.494 --> 00:37:13.362
so I can't really
sell you anything.

I'll let you in.

705
00:39:40.775 --> 00:39:42.544
I mean.
just the fact that you guys

706
00:39:42.579 --> 00:39:44.106
worked so hard
putting this together

707
00:39:44.141 --> 00:39:46.581
and got something or somebody
to communicate back

708
00:39:46.616 --> 00:39:48.143
is absolutely incredible.

709
00:39:48.178 --> 00:39:50.684
I am so proud of both of you.

710
00:39:50.719 --> 00:39:52.488
Emily. honey.
are you staying for dinner?

711
00:39:52.523 --> 00:39:53.786
Sure. I guess.

712
00:39:55.922 --> 00:39:59.693
Sweetie. we have to wash those
before you eat them. Remember?

713
00:39:59.728 --> 00:40:01.860
You had that horrible bout
of diarrhea last time.

714
00:40:01.895 --> 00:40:03.631
Jesus. Mom. Have a little couth.

Well. will you please

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.063
tell your sister
to come downstairs?

717
00:40:07.098 --> 00:40:08.966
And if you
have to use the bathroom.

718
00:40:09.001 --> 00:40:10.473
please use wet wipes.

719
00:40:10.508 --> 00:40:13.806
Hysterical. Mom.
but Jessie's not home.

720
00:40:13.841 --> 00:40:14.906
Where is she?

721
00:40:14.941 --> 00:40:16.545
I don't know.

722
00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:19.174
Her shift ended an hour ago.
Is her car here?

723
00:40:21.244 --> 00:40:24.047
I told her no Tobey's
until the weekend.

724
00:40:25.886 --> 00:40:28.051
Oh. you are
in serious trouble. Missy.

725
00:40:28.086 --> 00:40:30.526
sending me
straight to voicemail.

726
00:40:32.222 --> 00:40:33.958
Christopher. please
set up the table. sweetie.

727
00:40:33.993 --> 00:40:36.125
-I got it.
-Thank you.

728
00:40:40.769 --> 00:40:42.604
[Emily] Wait.
So has she not responded?

729
00:40:42.639 --> 00:40:44.870
No. and she usually does
right away.

730
00:40:44.905 --> 00:40:46.641
I'll solve this
once and for all.

731
00:40:52.242 --> 00:40:54.583
She's still at work.

732
00:40:55.619 --> 00:40:57.245
What?

733
00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.851
How could she still be there?

734
00:41:10.898 --> 00:41:12.865
[sighs] It's locked.

735
00:41:15.298 --> 00:41:16.572
[pounding]

736
00:41:16.607 --> 00:41:18.607
Jessie! Jessie. you in there?!

737
00:41:18.642 --> 00:41:20.510
Let me go check the back door.

738
00:41:32.656 --> 00:41:33.787
[Christopher] Jessie?

739
00:41:35.824 --> 00:41:37.560
Mom. Mom.

740
00:41:37.595 --> 00:41:39.892
-Huh?
-Give me a minute.

741
00:41:39.927 --> 00:41:42.059
-What?
-I think I just sharted.

742
00:41:42.094 --> 00:41:44.259
Honey. I told you
not to eat those grapes.

743
00:41:44.294 --> 00:41:46.767
I know. Mom. I was just hungry.

744
00:41:46.802 --> 00:41:48.571
I'm a growing boy. you know.

745
00:41:50.069 --> 00:41:52.707
[clatter]

746
00:41:52.742 --> 00:41:54.841
[metal creaks]

747
00:41:55.844 --> 00:41:57.976

752
00:42:28.239 --> 00:42:29.205

[police dispatch chatter]

754
00:42:36.049 --> 00:42:39.182
[Michelle] Um. I-I think
it was around 5:00.

755
00:42:39.217 --> 00:42:41.118
-It was a text from her.
-[sirens approaching]

756
00:42:41.153 --> 00:42:42.988
My God. I can't believe
this is happening.

757
00:42:43.023 --> 00:42:45.320
You need to find her.
You need to find her now.

758
00:42:45.355 --> 00:42:48.191
There are so many kids missing.
Something bad is happening.

759
00:42:48.226 --> 00:42:51.062
[police dispatch chatter]

760
00:42:51.097 --> 00:42:52.701
I'm scared. Em.

761
00:42:55.167 --> 00:42:57.200
I'm really scared.

762
00:43:05.782 --> 00:43:07.650
[chatter fades]

763
00:43:08.884 --> 00:43:10.081
[doorbell rings]

764
00:43:10.116 --> 00:43:12.215
[rain pattering]

765
00:43:14.054 --> 00:43:15.020
Hello there. Emily.

766
00:43:15.055 --> 00:43:16.219
Hi. Mr. Lutz.

767
00:43:16.254 --> 00:43:18.661
This is my friend Christopher.

768
00:43:18.696 --> 00:43:19.893
Nice to meet you. Christopher.

769
00:43:19.928 --> 00:43:22.599
Uh. please come in.

770
00:43:28.673 --> 00:43:30.365
Including your sister.
Christopher.

771
00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:34.677
there's been seven missing
persons reports this week alone.

772
00:43:34.712 --> 00:43:37.339
So do you know who these kids
are or where they're from?

773
00:43:37.374 --> 00:43:38.879
No. No one does.

774
00:43:38.914 --> 00:43:40.716
That's what makes it
so frustrating.

775
00:43:40.751 --> 00:43:44.313
Some say it's a bunch
of meth kids from Canopy Falls.

776
00:43:44.348 --> 00:43:47.657
Others think
it's a type of zombie.

777
00:43:47.692 --> 00:43:50.319
But in all the research
I've done.

778
00:43:50.354 --> 00:43:52.893
there's only been
one other account

779
00:43:52.928 --> 00:43:55.192
of these black-eyed kids.

780
00:43:56.734 --> 00:44:00.065
It happened in this town
over 50 years ago.

781
00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:02.870
Over 25 missing persons.

782
00:44:02.905 --> 00:44:05.367
and there was
only one eyewitness.

783
00:44:06.876 --> 00:44:11.043
And his name is Frederick Munch.

784
00:44:13.212 --> 00:44:16.884
He and his fiancée were taken
five days before their wedding.

785
00:44:16.919 --> 00:44:19.150
Apparently they let him go.

786
00:44:19.185 --> 00:44:20.756
Why?

787
00:44:20.791 --> 00:44:23.022
[chuckles]
You'd have to ask him.

788
00:44:23.057 --> 00:44:24.958
Is he still alive?

789
00:44:24.993 --> 00:44:25.959
He is.

790
00:44:25.994 --> 00:44:28.258
He lives over on Elm.

791
00:44:29.327 --> 00:44:32.427
Wait. Munch.
You mean Mean Mr. Munch?

792
00:44:32.462 --> 00:44:34.099
You know him?

793
00:44:34.134 --> 00:44:35.166
Yeah.

794
00:44:35.201 --> 00:44:36.739
All the kids know him.

795
00:44:36.774 --> 00:44:38.433
His house is totally haunted.

796
00:44:38.468 --> 00:44:40.468
Yeah. the kids created
the Munch challenge.

797
00:44:40.503 --> 00:44:42.778
It's where you gotta walk up
to his creepy doorsteps

798
00:44:42.813 --> 00:44:45.407
and ring his creepy doorbell
and try to make it out alive.

799
00:44:45.442 --> 00:44:47.717
and one kid tried it. and...

800
00:44:47.752 --> 00:44:49.345
He made it...

801
00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:52.216
but then broke into a seizure
the minute he got home.

802
00:44:54.055 --> 00:44:56.924
Well. I've been trying to talk
to him for the last six months.

803
00:44:56.959 --> 00:45:00.829
Threatened to kill me
if I stepped on his property.

804
00:45:00.864 --> 00:45:02.831
I'll talk to him.

805
00:45:02.866 --> 00:45:03.898
You're kidding.

806
00:45:03.933 --> 00:45:04.998
No. and you're coming.

807
00:45:05.033 --> 00:45:06.901
That's not a good idea. Emily.

808
00:45:07.871 --> 00:45:09.431
You have a better one?

809
00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:12.841
[thunder rumbling]

810
00:45:12.876 --> 00:45:15.173

812
00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:19.243
-Emily...
-Yeah?

813
00:45:19.278 --> 00:45:20.409
I'm quaking.

814
00:45:20.444 --> 00:45:22.081
Yeah. me. too.

815
00:45:22.116 --> 00:45:24.853
-[dog barking]
-What if he cuts our heads off

816
00:45:24.888 --> 00:45:26.888
and uses our bodies
as flotation devices?

817
00:45:26.923 --> 00:45:29.154
I don't think that's possible.
Bodies don't float.

818
00:45:29.189 --> 00:45:30.760
[Christopher]
We can literally run now.

819
00:45:30.795 --> 00:45:33.092
and the least we'll suffer
is a seizure.

820
00:45:36.196 --> 00:45:37.866
[doorbell buzzes]

821
00:45:39.903 --> 00:45:42.200

[sighs]

824
00:45:48.472 --> 00:45:50.780
Okay. obviously
he's not home. so--

825
00:45:50.815 --> 00:45:52.045
[Munch] Leave it by the door.

826
00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:53.981
Uh. hi. Mr. Munch. I'm Emily.

827
00:45:54.016 --> 00:45:55.312
and this is
my friend Christopher.

828
00:45:55.347 --> 00:45:56.885
We live down the street.

829
00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:57.853
Uh-huh.

830
00:45:57.888 --> 00:45:59.382
[intercom clicks off]

Uh. Mr. Munch?

832
00:46:02.354 --> 00:46:04.189
Mr. Munch!

[bird squawking]

834
00:46:05.192 --> 00:46:08.457
Oh. well. We tried.

835
00:46:10.131 --> 00:46:11.460
[doorbell buzzes]

836
00:46:13.101 --> 00:46:15.530
Emily. come on. He obviously
doesn't want us here.

837
00:46:15.565 --> 00:46:16.938
We're finding your sister.

838
00:46:16.973 --> 00:46:18.104
[sighs]

839
00:46:18.139 --> 00:46:20.238
Get off my property.

840
00:46:20.273 --> 00:46:22.174
Mr. Munch. please help us.

841
00:46:22.209 --> 00:46:24.143
Christopher's sister has been
taken by the black-eyed kids.

-Please just let us--

843
00:46:28.149 --> 00:46:29.346
We should go.

[Christopher] Could this house
be any creepier?

853
00:47:44.258 --> 00:47:45.455
[Emily] Shh.

854
00:47:49.263 --> 00:47:51.197
[Christopher] I didn't
know someone so creepy

855
00:47:51.232 --> 00:47:53.430
could be so talented.

856
00:47:53.465 --> 00:47:55.036
Christopher. shut up.

857
00:48:09.613 --> 00:48:11.921
I think I just urinated myself.

858
00:48:11.956 --> 00:48:13.285
Emily...

859
00:48:14.717 --> 00:48:16.156

00:48:53.294 --> 00:48:55.228
I haven't had one lesson.

[clock ticking]

864
00:49:02.435 --> 00:49:04.600
I appreciate you letting us in.

865
00:49:04.635 --> 00:49:06.503
That supposed to be a joke?

866
00:49:06.538 --> 00:49:08.406
I'm sorry.
I-I didn't mean it that way.

867
00:49:08.441 --> 00:49:10.672
We're just trying to get
all the information we can get.

868
00:49:10.707 --> 00:49:12.641
The black-eyed kids.

869
00:49:12.676 --> 00:49:15.985
Yes. exactly.

870
00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:18.086
I haven't talked about this

871
00:49:18.121 --> 00:49:19.681
in more than 50 years.

872
00:49:21.355 --> 00:49:23.223
I was too scared to.

873
00:49:27.328 --> 00:49:31.363
But with all
the kidnappings going on.

874
00:49:31.398 --> 00:49:33.464
I feel I need to.

875
00:49:33.499 --> 00:49:34.971
Thank you.

876
00:49:38.768 --> 00:49:41.571
I saw 'em first
in the winter of '59.

877
00:49:43.146 --> 00:49:46.642
They took me and my fiancée...

878
00:49:48.184 --> 00:49:49.678
all of 'em...

879
00:49:50.714 --> 00:49:53.319
with their alabaster skin...

880
00:49:55.356 --> 00:49:57.191
and that jet-black hair...

881
00:49:59.162 --> 00:50:00.491
black eyes.

882
00:50:03.199 --> 00:50:05.298
Black as briquettes.

883
00:50:09.502 --> 00:50:12.074
They had this awful odor.

884
00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:15.341
Awful.

885
00:50:18.841 --> 00:50:20.445
Smelled like...

886
00:50:21.778 --> 00:50:24.746
rotten molasses and. uh...

887
00:50:24.781 --> 00:50:26.286
pig droppings.

888
00:50:27.751 --> 00:50:30.158
I can still smell it today.

889
00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:35.790
They ended up taking
my sweet Juniper.

890
00:50:36.826 --> 00:50:38.397
My fiancée.

891
00:50:42.535 --> 00:50:44.205
And they let me go.

892
00:50:46.704 --> 00:50:50.343
There's not a day that I
don't wish it was the opposite.

893
00:50:50.378 --> 00:50:52.246
So where did they take her?

894
00:50:52.281 --> 00:50:55.117
Some sort of portal.

895
00:50:55.152 --> 00:50:57.086
A portal?

896
00:50:57.121 --> 00:50:58.351
To where?

897
00:50:59.552 --> 00:51:01.387
Space.

898
00:51:01.422 --> 00:51:02.685
Space?

899
00:51:04.161 --> 00:51:06.095
Space.

900
00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:08.097
Outer space.

901
00:51:08.132 --> 00:51:11.133
Like outer outer space?

902
00:51:11.168 --> 00:51:13.300
Like rocket ship outer space?

903
00:51:13.335 --> 00:51:15.599
This kid on the spectrum?

904
00:51:15.634 --> 00:51:17.469
[laughs] Yeah. of course.

905
00:51:18.439 --> 00:51:20.670
Outer space.

906
00:51:20.705 --> 00:51:24.377
So are these
black-eyed kids aliens?

907
00:51:24.412 --> 00:51:26.148
Yeah. that's what I'm saying.

908
00:51:28.350 --> 00:51:31.351
They don't refer to themselves
as black-eyed kids.

909
00:51:34.587 --> 00:51:36.818
They call themselves Jungspars.

910
00:51:39.394 --> 00:51:41.097
Jungspars?

911
00:51:45.895 --> 00:51:49.600
Every 20 years.
they come to Earth...

912
00:51:50.735 --> 00:51:53.736
to abduct
adolescent girls and boys.

913
00:51:53.771 --> 00:51:56.904
It's their harvesting time...

914
00:51:56.939 --> 00:51:59.280
a way for them
to propagate the human race

915
00:51:59.315 --> 00:52:01.744
on their planet for slavery.

916
00:52:08.291 --> 00:52:12.722
I was there. I've seen it.

917
00:52:14.231 --> 00:52:17.199
And believe me.
you don't want to see

918
00:52:17.234 --> 00:52:19.663
the things that I've seen.

919
00:52:25.539 --> 00:52:27.671
You've seen them. too.
haven't you?

920
00:52:27.706 --> 00:52:31.213
So why do they ask you
that question.

921
00:52:31.248 --> 00:52:32.676
to let them in?

922
00:52:33.745 --> 00:52:35.283
Because they have to.

923
00:52:36.451 --> 00:52:38.319
They need permission.

924
00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:43.225
They don't like
being said no to.

925
00:52:44.261 --> 00:52:47.163
So they will terrorize you...

926
00:52:47.858 --> 00:52:49.429
until you say yes.

927
00:52:49.464 --> 00:52:52.762
But whatever you do.
never say yes.

928
00:52:52.797 --> 00:52:57.965
Trust me when I tell you
the pain that you will suffer.

929
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.605
Saying no will be nothing

930
00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:05.379
compared to the pain that
you'll suffer if you say yes.

931
00:53:05.414 --> 00:53:08.283
So how long
do they stay here for?

932
00:53:08.318 --> 00:53:10.813
After researching.

933
00:53:10.848 --> 00:53:15.422
I discovered that the duration
of each stay

934
00:53:15.457 --> 00:53:18.359
was ten nights
from the first abduction.

935
00:53:18.394 --> 00:53:20.427
not a minute later.

936
00:53:20.462 --> 00:53:22.462
Holy crap.

937
00:53:22.497 --> 00:53:24.233
I'm sorry. Mr. Munch.
but I have to go.

938
00:53:24.268 --> 00:53:26.268
Hold on just one second.
young lady.

939
00:53:31.638 --> 00:53:32.835
Take that.

940
00:53:34.872 --> 00:53:37.576
In case you need
to summon them...

941
00:53:38.711 --> 00:53:40.678
or cause severe pain.

942
00:53:42.616 --> 00:53:43.714
Thanks.

943
00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:47.619

for them to chop our parts

I'm gonna have you arrested.

Are you comprehending me?

You gotta be kidding me.

You guys don't understand

1084
01:03:19.027 --> 01:03:20.587
that the people who are
still missing are still alive.

1085

Authorities still have no clue

1094

as to who's involved
in these snatchings.

1095
01:03:59.397 --> 01:04:02.497
but eyewitnesses
believe they're not human.

They're not human.
I don't know what they are.

Ah. Nana. please.
you gotta get me out of here.

the police will take care of it.

No. they don't even
know where he is! But I do.

Well. you tell them then.

of everything.

get out of here

for what's going on here.

do anything wrong.

I slept a minute last night.

01:15:32.287 --> 01:15:34.628
-I'd totally date you.
-Really?

1262
01:15:34.663 --> 01:15:36.223
So there's hope.

1263
01:15:36.258 --> 01:15:38.797
I mean. "if you were able
to go back in time" type hope.

1264

Nah. your dad's still got
some teenager left in him.

1272
01:15:59.919 --> 01:16:01.820
Oh. God. Dad. That's so creepy.

01:16:16.133 --> 01:16:17.770
Not funny.

1282
01:16:17.805 --> 01:16:19.101
