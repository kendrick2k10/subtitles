FOUR YEARS EARLIER

36
00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:19.791
Great job. Angelito. Perfect. keep it up.

37
00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:27.750
Whoa. check it out.

38
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.416
Damn. I'd eat that up.

39
00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:34.583
Check her out. There. See her?

40
00:02:34.666 --> 00:02:35.708
Who? With the ass?

41
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.375
No.

42
00:02:37.875 --> 00:02:39.625
the one with Estrella.
the other one.

43
00:02:39.708 --> 00:02:40.708
Damn…

44
00:02:40.791 --> 00:02:43.000
On Saturday I banged her
in the bathroom at Space.

45
00:02:43.083 --> 00:02:44.375
-Oh. yeah?
-You know it. bro.

46
00:02:44.875 --> 00:02:47.375
What are you saying?
I didn't see nothing. bro.

47
00:02:47.458 --> 00:02:50.375
No? And that wasn't you
knocking on the door. asshole?

48
00:02:50.458 --> 00:02:52.583
Yeah. 'cause I needed to piss. man.

49
00:02:53.291 --> 00:02:56.041
Guys. they're laughing
their asses off at us.

50
00:02:56.125 --> 00:02:58.291
-Say hi or something.
-No way. Forget it.

51
00:02:58.833 --> 00:03:00.333
The other one's hot. right?

52
00:03:00.416 --> 00:03:01.791
-Which one?
-Estrella. man.

53
00:03:01.875 --> 00:03:04.083
Shit. Forget about her. man.
She's with Poli.

54
00:03:04.166 --> 00:03:05.791
Isn't that dude in the joint?

55
00:03:05.875 --> 00:03:07.500
No. he only spent four days inside.

56
00:03:07.583 --> 00:03:10.125
And the night he got out
he robbed a store.

57
00:03:10.708 --> 00:03:14.041
He must be doin' her
every which way. right?

58
00:03:14.125 --> 00:03:15.583
Gettin' his pipes cleaned.

59
00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:18.958
With that mouth. she'd grab your cock
and suck you dry. man--

60
00:03:19.041 --> 00:03:20.625
Will you guys shut the fuck up?

61
00:03:20.708 --> 00:03:23.708
Look at Angelito getting all pissed off.

62
00:03:23.791 --> 00:03:25.916
What's up. Angelito?
Estrellita get you hot?

63
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.083
-Fuck off.
-Where you goin'?

64
00:03:27.166 --> 00:03:28.791
Dude. we're just talkin'.

65
00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:30.416
Don't get mad. man.

66
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.375
Hey. one thing.

67
00:03:33.916 --> 00:03:36.583
Next time. say it to my face. OK?

68
00:03:36.666 --> 00:03:37.583
Sound good to you?

69
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.500
What about you guys?

70
00:03:41.666 --> 00:03:43.416
That's what I like. Nice and quiet.

71
00:04:05.875 --> 00:04:06.833
What's up. Gramps?

72
00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:11.500
What is it?

73
00:04:11.583 --> 00:04:13.166
Bugs on the plants already?

74
00:04:13.833 --> 00:04:16.708
Don't talk to me about bugs.
I'm sick to death of them.

75
00:04:17.208 --> 00:04:19.125
Now. this will fuck them up.

76
00:04:20.416 --> 00:04:23.500
Well. don't overdo it. OK?
Then you won't be able to eat it.

77
00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.833
And Chico? How does he look?

78
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.958
Chico's an asshole because of Gitano.

79
00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:32.750
He doesn't know a damn thing about dogs.

80
00:04:32.833 --> 00:04:33.916
Neither do you.

81
00:04:50.916 --> 00:04:52.416
What's up. Chico?

82
00:04:53.875 --> 00:04:54.958
What's up. you fuck?

83
00:04:57.625 --> 00:04:59.625
Did you miss me or what. motherfucker?

84
00:05:02.375 --> 00:05:03.708
What's up. kid?

85
00:05:04.541 --> 00:05:05.708
What's up. Gitano?

86
00:05:06.583 --> 00:05:07.541
What are you up to?

87
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.958
Here. with this guy.

88
00:05:11.791 --> 00:05:13.750
-Looking good. right?
-Looking good.

89
00:05:14.375 --> 00:05:16.541
-Motherfucker's fatter.
-What are you talking about?

90
00:05:16.625 --> 00:05:18.500
I got his food under control. man.

91
00:05:18.583 --> 00:05:21.541
You know you gotta keep an eye on him.
He'll eat anything he can find.

92
00:05:22.083 --> 00:05:24.750
Don't give him any of the shit
my grandad gives you.

93
00:05:24.833 --> 00:05:26.916
I'd never give him
anything from your grandad.

94
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.875
It'll be more radioactive
than Chernobyl. man.

95
00:05:29.416 --> 00:05:31.083
He puts any old shit on that garden.

96
00:05:31.166 --> 00:05:34.625
It's better than him
sitting around at home all day. Seriously.

97
00:05:35.416 --> 00:05:37.166
So. should we take him out or what?

98
00:05:44.458 --> 00:05:45.291
Do you see him?

99
00:05:46.083 --> 00:05:47.875
No. no fucking idea where he is.

100
00:05:49.083 --> 00:05:51.666
Where is that dog? He always does this.

101
00:05:53.541 --> 00:05:55.666
-What if he's headed for the road?
-No way!

102
00:05:56.333 --> 00:05:57.250
He'll be back.

103
00:05:59.791 --> 00:06:00.625
Chico!

104
00:06:01.416 --> 00:06:02.458
Chico!

105
00:06:04.833 --> 00:06:06.458
-Chico. come here!
-Unbelievable.

106
00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.166
-Chico!
-Come here. Chico.

107
00:06:09.708 --> 00:06:10.833
Come. on Chico. Treat!

108
00:06:11.583 --> 00:06:13.125
-What's up. Chico?
-Take the treat.

109
00:06:14.458 --> 00:06:15.291
Come here.

110
00:06:15.791 --> 00:06:16.708
Get over here.

111
00:06:17.916 --> 00:06:19.916
You motherfucker. Good boy!

112
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.083
What did you get into. you nasty dog?

113
00:06:23.833 --> 00:06:24.666
You bastard.

114
00:06:30.791 --> 00:06:32.791
What was I saying?
From up there we must look--

115
00:06:32.875 --> 00:06:33.708
Like ants.

116
00:06:34.458 --> 00:06:36.500
Right? Know what I'm saying. man?

117
00:06:36.583 --> 00:06:38.125
But just in case they can see us.

118
00:06:38.208 --> 00:06:41.958
"All of you can go fuck yourselves.
You assholes. living high on the hog."

119
00:06:42.458 --> 00:06:43.291
C'mon. let's go.

120
00:06:44.708 --> 00:06:46.458
-Chico. where you going?
-What a dick.

121
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:11.958
Want a drink?

122
00:07:12.041 --> 00:07:13.208
Give me a rum and Coke.

123
00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.333
Hey. can I ask you a favor?

124
00:07:20.375 --> 00:07:21.250
Sure.

125
00:07:21.333 --> 00:07:23.500
Could you tell your boys they're assholes?

126
00:07:24.416 --> 00:07:26.083
I already do. every day.

127
00:07:26.166 --> 00:07:28.958
Right. but I'm fucking sick
of hearing the rumors

128
00:07:29.041 --> 00:07:31.583
that they're fucking my friend.
So if they want to brag.

129
00:07:31.666 --> 00:07:33.250
they can brag about their zits.

130
00:07:33.833 --> 00:07:36.666
By zits you mean Manuel. don't you?
That guy there.

131
00:07:37.291 --> 00:07:40.583
He's always been so self-conscious about
his acne even though it's better now.

132
00:07:41.083 --> 00:07:42.208
Better?

133
00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:44.416
You should see him
when he really breaks out.

134
00:07:44.916 --> 00:07:47.708
You can't make out his nose.
Fucker looks like a potato.

135
00:07:47.791 --> 00:07:49.125
-Yeah? Seriously?
-I swear.

136
00:07:49.833 --> 00:07:51.458
What a fucking riot. am I right?

137
00:07:53.208 --> 00:07:55.125
He was talking about a friend of his.

138
00:07:55.625 --> 00:07:58.000
Sure. We know each other. right?

139
00:07:58.083 --> 00:07:58.958
I don't think so.

140
00:07:59.458 --> 00:08:00.291
You sure?

141
00:08:01.666 --> 00:08:02.916
Your face rings a bell.

142
00:08:03.375 --> 00:08:04.208
From the gym.

143
00:08:05.125 --> 00:08:06.250
Shit. that's right.

144
00:08:06.791 --> 00:08:10.125
Why don't you come by the gym
tomorrow and we can have a nice chat?

145
00:08:11.708 --> 00:08:13.083
What do you want to talk about?

146
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.000
How about we talk about
how hot Estrella is?

147
00:08:16.666 --> 00:08:18.166
Chill. Don't get all macho on me.

148
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:19.666
What? Isn't it true?

149
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:22.291
It's true. I'm smokin'.
But I say it and you shut up.

150
00:08:22.375 --> 00:08:24.583
All right then. chill out.
What's your name. man?

151
00:08:27.833 --> 00:08:28.958
Ángel.

152
00:08:30.375 --> 00:08:31.208
Angelito.

153
00:08:32.083 --> 00:08:33.541
Is she hot or not?

154
00:08:33.625 --> 00:08:35.625
Will you stop being a dick?

155
00:08:35.708 --> 00:08:36.541
Relax.

156
00:08:36.625 --> 00:08:39.291
-I'm very relaxed.
-I'm just asking the kid a question.

157
00:08:40.166 --> 00:08:41.083
Is she hot or not?

158
00:08:41.166 --> 00:08:42.083
Yeah.

159
00:08:42.166 --> 00:08:43.291
She's hot.

160
00:08:43.375 --> 00:08:44.333
Real hot.

161
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.750
Fuck you both. you two tough guys!

162
00:08:46.833 --> 00:08:48.250
Go on. bust your heads open!

163
00:09:00.083 --> 00:09:01.708
Good. Angelito. Very good.

164
00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:04.333
Tomorrow afternoon.
I'll see you at the gym!

165
00:09:04.416 --> 00:09:06.125
Be there. Don't be a pussy!

166
00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.333
Why the fuck are we here?
You gonna tell me?

167
00:09:20.041 --> 00:09:21.208
Did I ask you to come?

168
00:09:21.291 --> 00:09:24.750
What the hell did you want me to do?
Let you go alone and get your ass kicked?

169
00:09:24.833 --> 00:09:27.708
Well. it doesn't seem
to bother these guys.

170
00:09:27.791 --> 00:09:29.041
'Cause they're fuckheads.

171
00:09:29.541 --> 00:09:32.250
I'm your boy. I don't want them
to bust your face open. bro.

172
00:09:33.458 --> 00:09:34.458
That's my problem.

173
00:09:35.208 --> 00:09:39.541
You really think Estrellita's gonna come
put salve on your busted face?

174
00:09:43.875 --> 00:09:45.875
God damn it.
That motherfucker didn't show.

175
00:09:46.833 --> 00:09:49.291
So. he's not here.
We held up our end. right?

176
00:09:49.375 --> 00:09:50.208
We?

177
00:09:51.375 --> 00:09:53.250
You're gettin' a little cocky. aren't you?

178
00:09:53.333 --> 00:09:54.166
Fuck off. man.

179
00:10:06.625 --> 00:10:08.125
Angelito. come on. Get in.

180
00:10:14.166 --> 00:10:15.000
No?

181
00:10:15.708 --> 00:10:17.000
Got anything better to do

182
00:10:17.083 --> 00:10:18.541
besides jerking off your boy?

183
00:10:24.625 --> 00:10:25.750
No. Ángel. Don't.

184
00:10:35.375 --> 00:10:37.250
Check it out. Pintas. That's a nice ride.

185
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.625
The four-by-four. OK.

186
00:10:39.708 --> 00:10:40.833
Got the car-hacker?

187
00:10:40.916 --> 00:10:41.833
Of course. man.

188
00:10:51.541 --> 00:10:53.125
You fucking got me good yesterday.

189
00:10:56.041 --> 00:10:57.166
I wasn't expecting it.

190
00:11:03.625 --> 00:11:04.541
What's this?

191
00:11:05.833 --> 00:11:06.750
What do you think?

192
00:11:09.833 --> 00:11:11.000
If you want to get out.

193
00:11:11.625 --> 00:11:12.625
tell me now.

194
00:11:13.125 --> 00:11:14.500
Don't dick me around later.

195
00:11:17.458 --> 00:11:19.708
We'll have three minutes
before the cops come.

196
00:11:20.208 --> 00:11:21.833
We have to haul ass. got it?

197
00:11:23.333 --> 00:11:24.166
Got it.

198
00:11:25.208 --> 00:11:26.041
Fuck yeah.

199
00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:51.583
Angelito. with me.

200
00:11:56.583 --> 00:11:57.416
Go!

201
00:12:04.458 --> 00:12:05.541
Come on. go. Move it!

202
00:12:28.541 --> 00:12:30.750
Come on. last one! Let's go. guys!

203
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Fuck.

204
00:12:42.916 --> 00:12:43.916
Hurry! Someone's coming!

205
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:45.666
Come on. let's go!

206
00:12:49.875 --> 00:12:51.541
Bags in the trunk! Move it!

207
00:12:52.166 --> 00:12:53.416
Fuck it!

208
00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.333
The car!

209
00:13:22.208 --> 00:13:25.583
We gotta get on the freeway!
Turn right! Go!

210
00:13:50.458 --> 00:13:51.958
Why the hell aren't they following us?

211
00:13:52.916 --> 00:13:54.291
They'll be at the other end!

212
00:13:58.541 --> 00:14:00.041
-What are you doing?
-Let's go!

213
00:14:07.708 --> 00:14:08.750
Go right!

214
00:14:25.791 --> 00:14:27.208
Move it!

215
00:14:29.291 --> 00:14:30.708
Come on!

216
00:14:53.208 --> 00:14:54.666
Have fun at the wedding. OK?

217
00:14:55.208 --> 00:14:56.250
We'll have a good time.

218
00:14:59.125 --> 00:15:00.750
STUDIO G SALON

219
00:15:01.916 --> 00:15:02.833
I'm going. girls.

220
00:15:03.833 --> 00:15:05.750
Encarni. pay Saray. OK?

221
00:15:05.833 --> 00:15:07.708
OK. Have a good one.

222
00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.166
See you tomorrow. girls.

223
00:15:44.458 --> 00:15:46.458
CUEMA'S PAINT AND BODY SHOP

224
00:15:51.625 --> 00:15:52.958
What the fuck's your deal?

225
00:15:53.458 --> 00:15:54.291
What?

226
00:15:54.375 --> 00:15:56.083
-You gonna tell me?
-Tell you what?

227
00:15:56.583 --> 00:15:58.583
You're fuckin' gettin' some from Estrella.

228
00:16:00.458 --> 00:16:02.291
What the fuck? Are you stupid?

229
00:16:02.375 --> 00:16:05.583
Sure. I'm stupid. But why the hell's
that chick hanging around the garage?

230
00:16:06.416 --> 00:16:08.541
I thought you patched things up with Poli.

231
00:16:09.583 --> 00:16:11.708
You're gonna get
my uncle's garage torched.

232
00:16:12.541 --> 00:16:13.375
Shut up.

233
00:16:18.625 --> 00:16:19.458
No way. girl.

234
00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:22.583
I don't know.

235
00:16:23.625 --> 00:16:25.625
I don't know. babe. Ask her.

236
00:16:28.041 --> 00:16:30.041
I don't know. Tell her to go get you.

237
00:16:30.125 --> 00:16:31.833
Alright. I'll call you later. Yeah.

238
00:16:32.583 --> 00:16:33.416
See you later.

239
00:16:36.583 --> 00:16:37.416
What's up?

240
00:16:38.541 --> 00:16:39.375
Hey.

241
00:16:39.875 --> 00:16:41.708
Don't you have a cleaner jumpsuit?

242
00:16:43.375 --> 00:16:44.208
They're his.

243
00:16:45.666 --> 00:16:47.000
How'd you know I was here?

244
00:16:47.708 --> 00:16:50.166
People. man. They gossip.

245
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.583
How'd you know about the salon?

246
00:16:53.083 --> 00:16:53.916
Same way.

247
00:16:54.875 --> 00:16:57.583
I bet Nando's telling
half the neighborhood about this.

248
00:16:58.375 --> 00:16:59.708
Not that much to tell.

249
00:17:01.708 --> 00:17:02.875
That's what I'm saying.

250
00:17:03.708 --> 00:17:05.166
It's all pretty clear. right?

251
00:17:07.541 --> 00:17:09.625
Why's that? Because I got in his car?

252
00:17:11.041 --> 00:17:13.666
-For starters.
-Well… I'm here now.

253
00:17:14.166 --> 00:17:15.625
Yeah. you're here now.

254
00:17:16.416 --> 00:17:19.458
-I have no fucking clue what your deal is.
-No? What about you?

255
00:17:20.916 --> 00:17:23.458
First you two fight. right?
Like cocks. real macho.

256
00:17:23.541 --> 00:17:26.166
And two minutes later.
you hit some store all buddy-buddy.

257
00:17:26.875 --> 00:17:28.000
-Shit happens.
-Sure.

258
00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:32.125
So why'd you post up
outside the salon. looking all dopey?

259
00:17:32.416 --> 00:17:33.416
Dopey?

260
00:17:35.666 --> 00:17:37.125
Do I look like dopey to you?

261
00:17:40.875 --> 00:17:43.083
Are you gonna play with
the doll or the ball?

262
00:17:43.791 --> 00:17:45.291
You gotta choose. as they say.

263
00:17:45.666 --> 00:17:46.500
Right.

264
00:17:47.458 --> 00:17:50.041
What if I need the ball.
so the doll will play with me?

265
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:56.250
Oh. my God!

266
00:17:57.625 --> 00:18:00.125
Right. give me a dopey face.

267
00:18:05.041 --> 00:18:07.083
Great. perfect.

268
00:18:07.166 --> 00:18:08.375
Be real careful.

269
00:18:09.083 --> 00:18:09.916
Always.

270
00:18:10.791 --> 00:18:13.250
Why don't you get my number
from one of your boys.

271
00:18:13.333 --> 00:18:14.750
and I'll send you the photo?

272
00:18:15.291 --> 00:18:16.125
Just sayin'.

273
00:18:21.083 --> 00:18:22.041
What a bitch.

274
00:18:51.625 --> 00:18:53.791
The hard times are fucking over. Angelito.

275
00:18:54.666 --> 00:18:56.208
This is gonna be a huge score.

276
00:19:39.666 --> 00:19:40.875
How's it goin'. Ángel?

277
00:19:43.375 --> 00:19:45.333
You know you fucked up big time. right?

278
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.833
Robbery. attempting to flee.
resisting arrest…

279
00:19:51.458 --> 00:19:52.916
-I didn't resist.
-No?

280
00:19:54.041 --> 00:19:56.458
Ramming two squad cars is no big deal?

281
00:19:56.541 --> 00:19:57.958
I didn't ram anyone.

282
00:19:58.666 --> 00:19:59.500
You didn't?

283
00:20:00.833 --> 00:20:03.166
Why are your friends saying
the opposite. then?

284
00:20:04.416 --> 00:20:06.375
You haven't learned how this works yet?

285
00:20:10.125 --> 00:20:12.458
They find some sucker like you to step in.

286
00:20:12.541 --> 00:20:15.041
And if things go south.
tough shit for the new guy.

287
00:20:15.666 --> 00:20:18.875
He even got himself on camera
with the stolen car. before the heist.

288
00:20:19.375 --> 00:20:20.666
What do you want?

289
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:22.166
For you to use your damn head.

290
00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:24.125
Now make a proper statement.

291
00:20:24.208 --> 00:20:25.791
Include the other guys' names

292
00:20:25.875 --> 00:20:28.208
and explain that they put you up to this.

293
00:20:29.375 --> 00:20:30.208
Alright?

294
00:20:30.833 --> 00:20:34.458
I see here you don't have parents. right?
You live with your grandad.

295
00:20:34.541 --> 00:20:39.291
Well. the judge is sure to
take that into consideration.

296
00:20:39.375 --> 00:20:41.708
I'm not saying
you'll get off scot-free. but…

297
00:20:42.416 --> 00:20:44.041
it could be pretty good for you.

298
00:20:46.583 --> 00:20:47.708
You think this is funny?

299
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.125
What's so funny?

300
00:20:51.291 --> 00:20:52.416
You've only got me.

301
00:20:54.458 --> 00:20:56.000
You don't have shit.

302
00:21:01.125 --> 00:21:02.333
Twenty arrests.

303
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.708
two jail sentences.
3 robberies pending trial.

304
00:21:05.791 --> 00:21:08.416
I don't need footage of him.
I've seen him so often.

305
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.291
I know it was him
just by the way he walks.

306
00:21:10.375 --> 00:21:11.583
You want to be like him?

307
00:21:12.125 --> 00:21:14.375
If so. you're on the right track.

308
00:21:17.083 --> 00:21:20.208
And you keep your mouth shut
like an asshole. good going.

309
00:22:03.333 --> 00:22:04.333
Got a cigarette?

310
00:22:09.625 --> 00:22:10.875
Hey. Cosme.

311
00:22:11.458 --> 00:22:13.375
Beat it. You're a pain in the ass.

312
00:22:13.458 --> 00:22:16.291
Beat it. You're always
after the new guys. man.

313
00:22:17.125 --> 00:22:17.958
Go to your side.

314
00:22:19.583 --> 00:22:20.791
Was he asking for money?

315
00:22:21.916 --> 00:22:24.333
Ignore him. he's looney-tunes.

316
00:22:25.625 --> 00:22:27.583
Well. like half the guys in here.

317
00:22:27.666 --> 00:22:29.083
Loneliness is a bummer. man.

318
00:22:30.708 --> 00:22:31.666
I'm Motor.

319
00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:33.291
Well. my real name's Matias.

320
00:22:33.375 --> 00:22:35.916
but my boys say
I'm always taking people for a ride.

321
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.291
But it's more like I can explain things
and they can't. What about you?

322
00:22:40.875 --> 00:22:41.708
Ángel.

323
00:22:42.458 --> 00:22:43.541
Don't you know Poli?

324
00:22:45.333 --> 00:22:49.250
Relax. bro. I know him. too.
We've worked together.

325
00:22:50.458 --> 00:22:51.291
So?

326
00:22:51.375 --> 00:22:53.083
He wants to get you out of here.

327
00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:57.625
Look. what you gotta do now…
You got a lawyer?

328
00:22:58.458 --> 00:22:59.333
Public defender.

329
00:22:59.416 --> 00:23:01.250
You might as well not have one.

330
00:23:01.333 --> 00:23:03.083
Call your lawyer.

331
00:23:03.166 --> 00:23:06.208
Tell him to fuck off.
And once you've done that.

332
00:23:06.291 --> 00:23:07.333
call this number.

333
00:23:10.166 --> 00:23:11.958
Her name's Mercedes. She's legit.

334
00:23:12.041 --> 00:23:13.500
She's always worked with us.

335
00:23:14.833 --> 00:23:16.166
OK? Trust me.

336
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.708
-See you. bro.
-Thanks.

337
00:23:32.625 --> 00:23:33.458
Hello. Ángel.

338
00:23:34.291 --> 00:23:35.875
I'm Mercedes. Nice to meet you.

339
00:23:37.625 --> 00:23:38.750
How are you doing?

340
00:23:39.666 --> 00:23:40.541
Hanging in there.

341
00:23:43.208 --> 00:23:46.500
Well. we had some bad luck
with the gas station camera.

342
00:23:47.416 --> 00:23:48.333
Bad luck. sure.

343
00:23:50.666 --> 00:23:52.916
A coincidence that
it only recorded me. right?

344
00:23:54.333 --> 00:23:55.208
What do you mean?

345
00:23:55.833 --> 00:23:57.875
Maybe one of those fucks wanted

346
00:23:57.958 --> 00:24:00.458
to get someone's fucking mug
at the gas station.

347
00:24:02.041 --> 00:24:03.791
I don't know. Maybe.

348
00:24:03.875 --> 00:24:07.875
And maybe someone should've thought twice
before playing with the big boys.

349
00:24:08.791 --> 00:24:09.791
Don't you think?

350
00:24:12.541 --> 00:24:15.166
Ángel. I've seen
all the gas station footage.

351
00:24:15.708 --> 00:24:17.958
You might as well have waved
right at the camera.

352
00:24:19.083 --> 00:24:19.916
OK?

353
00:24:21.708 --> 00:24:25.250
So. I don't know what the police told you
or what you told them…

354
00:24:25.791 --> 00:24:27.333
I didn't tell them anything.

355
00:24:27.416 --> 00:24:29.041
Perfect. Great.

356
00:24:30.041 --> 00:24:31.666
You don't have to talk to anyone. OK?

357
00:24:32.666 --> 00:24:36.083
The main thing is
the footage links you to vehicle theft.

358
00:24:36.166 --> 00:24:38.875
But since you were never
inside the jeweler's.

359
00:24:38.958 --> 00:24:41.875
they can't link you to the other crime.

360
00:24:41.958 --> 00:24:42.791
Understand?

361
00:24:44.041 --> 00:24:45.875
The car's one thing.
The jeweler's. another.

362
00:24:46.041 --> 00:24:47.958
That's another file. case and report.

363
00:24:49.625 --> 00:24:50.750
-Got it?
-Yes.

364
00:24:52.208 --> 00:24:55.125
If you said nothing.
they don't have anything on anyone.

365
00:24:56.333 --> 00:24:57.208
OK.

366
00:24:57.875 --> 00:24:59.833
I'll request bail when we get to court.

367
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:01.500
And money's no problem.

368
00:25:02.458 --> 00:25:03.791
Your buddies are handling it.

369
00:25:05.875 --> 00:25:06.833
So. what now?

370
00:25:07.541 --> 00:25:08.458
Nothing.

371
00:25:08.833 --> 00:25:10.291
You're getting out very soon.

372
00:25:11.083 --> 00:25:13.250
So. take it easy and stay out of trouble.

373
00:25:13.833 --> 00:25:14.875
-Alright?
-OK.

374
00:25:58.541 --> 00:25:59.833
C'mon. Get in. bro.

375
00:26:15.125 --> 00:26:16.708
Look. kid.

376
00:26:16.791 --> 00:26:20.125
The boys and I got you… a present. OK?

377
00:26:20.208 --> 00:26:21.125
Put it on. please.

378
00:26:25.125 --> 00:26:28.500
Shit. don't fuck with me.
I just got out. I don't want any trouble.

379
00:26:31.083 --> 00:26:32.916
Hear that. Pintas?
He doesn't want trouble.

380
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.541
Sure. no trouble. Please!

381
00:26:36.083 --> 00:26:36.958
What's he sayin'?

382
00:26:37.708 --> 00:26:40.416
No fucking idea. but it smells like
someone needs a diaper change.

383
00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:43.166
He stinks like shit.
but we'll fix that in a sec.

384
00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:45.000
Put the fucking thing on him!

385
00:26:45.083 --> 00:26:47.625
-Cut the shit. alright?
-Hey. god damn it--

386
00:26:48.291 --> 00:26:49.875
What the fuck are you doing?

387
00:26:50.583 --> 00:26:52.125
Chill the fuck out. Angelito.

388
00:26:52.208 --> 00:26:53.416
-Kiddo!
-Son of a bitch.

389
00:26:54.791 --> 00:26:56.708
-You got your ID. right?
-Yeah. I do!

390
00:26:56.791 --> 00:26:58.458
We're going on a trip. kiddo!

391
00:26:58.541 --> 00:26:59.375
Fuck yeah!

392
00:27:20.875 --> 00:27:21.958
From the jeweler's.

393
00:27:22.041 --> 00:27:23.958
We made a killing.

394
00:27:24.833 --> 00:27:27.916
In two days. if you've got
even one bill left. I'm burning it.

395
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:28.916
You got me?

396
00:28:28.041 --> 00:28:30.916
What are you doing. Angelito?
No way. man. Absolutely not.

397
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.541
No. Get over there. man.

398
00:28:32.625 --> 00:28:33.875
-Move it.
-Son of a bitch…

399
00:28:33.958 --> 00:28:36.500
We're here to have fun. bro.
What are you doing?

400
00:29:18.208 --> 00:29:19.708
You don't remember me. do you?

401
00:29:21.083 --> 00:29:23.333
-Sole. from grade school.
-Sole?

402
00:29:24.291 --> 00:29:25.500
Soledad Manchado.

403
00:29:25.583 --> 00:29:27.291
Holy shit! Manchado!

404
00:29:27.375 --> 00:29:28.500
Damn. that's right.

405
00:29:29.583 --> 00:29:31.583
It took me a while too. eh?

406
00:29:31.666 --> 00:29:33.250
You were such a runt back then…

407
00:29:33.791 --> 00:29:35.458
You look completely different.

408
00:29:35.541 --> 00:29:36.833
Fuck. so do you.

409
00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:09.958
There's no cover. right?

410
00:30:18.791 --> 00:30:20.291
I didn't know you worked here.

411
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.875
-Sometimes. when they call me.
-Right.

412
00:30:24.583 --> 00:30:25.666
What about the salon?

413
00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:29.375
They close at night. didn't you know?

414
00:30:30.166 --> 00:30:32.416
What's the problem? Are you mad at me?

415
00:30:33.666 --> 00:30:35.500
-No. not at you. Why?
-I don't know.

416
00:30:37.666 --> 00:30:39.416
You told me I had to choose.

417
00:30:40.208 --> 00:30:43.291
Yeah. and it looks like you made
a great fucking choice. man.

418
00:30:43.375 --> 00:30:44.208
Right.

419
00:30:45.875 --> 00:30:46.708
What about you?

420
00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:48.375
What about me?

421
00:30:48.458 --> 00:30:50.291
I found out you broke up with Poli.

422
00:30:52.625 --> 00:30:53.916
Your boy's nuts. man.

423
00:30:54.958 --> 00:30:57.291
He's fucking convinced I have
to be with him. I don't.

424
00:30:59.666 --> 00:31:00.791
Did he do anything to you?

425
00:31:03.666 --> 00:31:07.625
No… He didn't do anything to me.
if that's what you're thinking.

426
00:31:08.666 --> 00:31:11.458
-If I find out--
-If you find out… Yeah. sure.

427
00:31:12.458 --> 00:31:14.791
-Look. your boys.
-Yeah. I see 'em.

428
00:31:14.875 --> 00:31:16.083
So. get outta here.

429
00:31:16.166 --> 00:31:17.000
No. I'm good.

430
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:18.833
What's up. Nando?

431
00:31:18.916 --> 00:31:20.500
-What's up. girl?
-How are you?

432
00:31:24.125 --> 00:31:25.083
Yo. snap out of it!

433
00:31:25.166 --> 00:31:27.583
The phones won't get in
the car by themselves. Fuck.

434
00:31:28.666 --> 00:31:29.583
-See you.
-Dude!

435
00:31:31.458 --> 00:31:33.291
Man. you're really busting my balls.

436
00:31:43.291 --> 00:31:44.541
Alright…

437
00:31:45.791 --> 00:31:48.125
Three hundred of these. right?

438
00:31:48.208 --> 00:31:49.208
Three-fifty.

439
00:31:50.416 --> 00:31:51.250
Are you sure?

440
00:31:52.375 --> 00:31:53.416
I counted 300.

441
00:31:55.916 --> 00:31:56.750
Julio.

442
00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:00.541
Julito. do me a favor.
Count these phones again. the white ones.

443
00:32:02.166 --> 00:32:05.125
Let's say there are 350. like you say.

444
00:32:05.208 --> 00:32:07.125
There are 350.

445
00:32:10.791 --> 00:32:12.208
This is what I can give you.

446
00:32:12.875 --> 00:32:15.458
Get the fuck outta here. Marcelo.
What is this shit?

447
00:32:16.791 --> 00:32:18.125
Alright. Polito…

448
00:32:18.208 --> 00:32:19.041
Look.

449
00:32:19.583 --> 00:32:21.041
See all those boxes up there?

450
00:32:22.375 --> 00:32:24.708
More phones.
And you know what the deal is?

451
00:32:26.875 --> 00:32:29.500
Next month. new ones come out
with new bullshit.

452
00:32:29.583 --> 00:32:32.416
And these will be worthless.
Nobody will buy them.

453
00:32:32.916 --> 00:32:34.083
You know what I mean?

454
00:32:34.166 --> 00:32:35.000
Marcelo!

455
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:36.625
Give me a second.

456
00:32:39.583 --> 00:32:40.416
Who's that?

457
00:32:42.041 --> 00:32:42.916
Rogelio. bro.

458
00:32:43.791 --> 00:32:44.833
He runs all this.

459
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:46.875
This. a scrapyard.

460
00:32:47.458 --> 00:32:49.666
a car inspection garage.
even a whorehouse.

461
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.500
and who knows what else.

462
00:32:52.583 --> 00:32:53.958
Here he's the fucking boss.

463
00:32:56.166 --> 00:32:57.000
What is it?

464
00:33:00.083 --> 00:33:00.916
You know her?

465
00:33:01.583 --> 00:33:02.416
Grade school.

466
00:33:04.083 --> 00:33:05.541
That's his daughter. dumbass.

467
00:33:06.041 --> 00:33:06.916
Did you fuck her?

468
00:33:07.791 --> 00:33:08.916
Should we talk to him?

469
00:33:09.416 --> 00:33:10.250
Don't you dare.

470
00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:11.708
Ángel.

471
00:33:14.166 --> 00:33:15.000
Fucking Ángel…

472
00:33:16.666 --> 00:33:17.500
Who's this?

473
00:33:18.458 --> 00:33:19.291
Good afternoon.

474
00:33:20.041 --> 00:33:21.000
Don Rogelio. right?

475
00:33:23.875 --> 00:33:25.375
-Ángel.
-Pleasure to meet you.

476
00:33:25.458 --> 00:33:26.291
Likewise.

477
00:33:29.291 --> 00:33:33.125
He sure gave you a look and didn't like
your thing with his daughter one bit.

478
00:33:37.083 --> 00:33:39.416
We should just gradually move
them. ourselves.

479
00:33:40.458 --> 00:33:43.791
No way. bro. People are up to their necks
in phones. you heard him.

480
00:33:44.375 --> 00:33:46.166
Then we take them somewhere else.

481
00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:47.583
We can't. OK?

482
00:33:47.666 --> 00:33:50.083
You don't fuck with this guy.
He's the buyer. Period.

483
00:33:51.166 --> 00:33:52.041
What if he isn't?

484
00:33:55.416 --> 00:33:59.000
That motherfucker has contacts.
He's got eyes everywhere.

485
00:33:59.083 --> 00:34:02.375
Feds. cops… Mess with this guy

486
00:34:02.458 --> 00:34:04.958
and they'll be on you
all fucking day. You get me?

487
00:34:06.458 --> 00:34:08.166
C'mon. cheer the fuck up.

488
00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:09.958
We'll score big tonight.

489
00:34:10.916 --> 00:34:11.750
I can't tonight.

490
00:35:15.875 --> 00:35:17.166
Hello!

491
00:35:18.583 --> 00:35:20.500
What's up. big guy?

492
00:35:22.833 --> 00:35:23.666
Here.

493
00:35:24.541 --> 00:35:25.916
Give him this. he loves it.

494
00:35:27.041 --> 00:35:28.416
Isn't that good. Chico?

495
00:35:30.083 --> 00:35:31.333
You're so handsome!

496
00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:35.500
It's amazing he's letting you pet him.
Greyhounds are real cold.

497
00:35:37.125 --> 00:35:38.333
That means he likes you.

498
00:35:39.041 --> 00:35:41.958
What do you think. Chico?
This pretty girl came to see you.

499
00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:51.458
I don't believe it. man.

500
00:35:52.833 --> 00:35:53.666
What?

501
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.583
You're going to prison again.

502
00:35:58.208 --> 00:36:01.791
Well. tell that to the judge tomorrow.
Let's see if he listens to you.

503
00:36:01.875 --> 00:36:04.541
Make that good boy face.
and maybe he'll let you off.

504
00:36:04.708 --> 00:36:05.916
What good boy face?

505
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.125
The one you made
a moment ago with Chico.

506
00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:11.333
Make that face.
and they'll forget everything.

507
00:36:12.208 --> 00:36:13.041
Won't they?

508
00:36:18.541 --> 00:36:19.875
Would you come to fuck me?

509
00:36:21.041 --> 00:36:21.875
To prison?

510
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.916
I think you gotta be married for that.

511
00:36:31.916 --> 00:36:34.416
Are you always this romantic
after the first time?

512
00:36:43.083 --> 00:36:43.916
Just a second.

513
00:36:51.333 --> 00:36:54.958
Hey. Ángel. I'm at the market.
What do we do?

514
00:36:55.041 --> 00:36:58.041
-You're there?
-Yeah. but he wants 1000 more.

515
00:36:58.125 --> 00:36:59.333
Motherfucker.

516
00:36:59.916 --> 00:37:01.791
So. what now. bro? Should I go ahead?

517
00:37:03.208 --> 00:37:04.333
What do you think?

518
00:37:05.083 --> 00:37:06.333
OK. I'll call you later.

519
00:37:16.833 --> 00:37:17.666
That's it.

520
00:37:35.208 --> 00:37:36.666
Give it a fucking rest.

521
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:38.208
I'm not doin' anything. bro.

522
00:37:38.291 --> 00:37:41.416
You're not?
You're basically laughing in their faces.

523
00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:43.500
I'm tempted. that's for sure.

524
00:37:46.625 --> 00:37:47.458
What is it?

525
00:37:49.416 --> 00:37:50.250
Ángel.

526
00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:55.458
The report on the prints in the car
that we asked for is gone.

527
00:37:55.541 --> 00:37:56.375
It's gone?

528
00:37:57.791 --> 00:37:59.541
-They didn't do it?
-The car's gone.

529
00:37:59.625 --> 00:38:00.625
It's not at the lot.

530
00:38:01.583 --> 00:38:02.416
So. what now?

531
00:38:04.083 --> 00:38:04.916
What do you think?

532
00:38:06.166 --> 00:38:07.000
I don't know.

533
00:38:08.458 --> 00:38:09.458
But if there's no car…

534
00:38:09.541 --> 00:38:10.625
No car. no case.

535
00:38:11.958 --> 00:38:13.708
The prosecutor dropped the case.

536
00:38:14.375 --> 00:38:15.625
You're free. bro!

537
00:38:25.875 --> 00:38:26.875
Ángel.

538
00:38:26.958 --> 00:38:27.791
listen.

539
00:38:29.333 --> 00:38:32.125
They don't like
these games one damn bit. OK?

540
00:38:32.208 --> 00:38:33.833
Next time. they'll come for you.

541
00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:35.791
Be careful.

542
00:38:38.083 --> 00:38:38.958
Yeah!

543
00:39:02.166 --> 00:39:05.625
Tomorrow morning they're coming
for at least half. It has to be tonight.

544
00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:07.958
And the keys?

545
00:39:08.041 --> 00:39:10.333
-Inside the safe.
-You're shitting me.

546
00:39:11.291 --> 00:39:13.166
I'm taking a big fucking risk.

547
00:40:30.125 --> 00:40:31.041
Move it!

548
00:40:41.958 --> 00:40:42.791
Come on!

549
00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:09.625
Move it. Get in your cars.

550
00:41:59.041 --> 00:42:00.083
Estrella!

551
00:42:00.708 --> 00:42:01.750
Come down!

552
00:42:03.666 --> 00:42:05.500
Cut it out. asshole!

553
00:42:05.583 --> 00:42:06.750
-Estrella!
-What?

554
00:42:06.833 --> 00:42:07.916
Come down!

555
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.791
Girl. get down there.
So the rest of us can sleep!

556
00:42:11.875 --> 00:42:13.416
Fuck me!

557
00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:15.791
What's going on?
Are you crazy or what?

558
00:42:15.875 --> 00:42:18.458
-Get the fuck down here!
-Yeah. go down. girl!

559
00:42:18.541 --> 00:42:20.541
-Fuck off.
-C'mon.

560
00:42:25.333 --> 00:42:27.041
What's wrong with you. man?

561
00:42:27.125 --> 00:42:29.666
-I wanted to see you. girl.
-OK. I wanted to see you. too.

562
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:31.791
But that's what the fucking phone's for.

563
00:42:31.875 --> 00:42:34.083
-About time! Get out of here!
-Go on already!

564
00:42:34.166 --> 00:42:35.000
Go on. bitch!

565
00:42:35.083 --> 00:42:38.541
Luisito. shut your mouth!
Mind your own business.

566
00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:40.375
I didn't know your apartment.

567
00:42:40.958 --> 00:42:43.500
You want to be
the big shot in the hood. or what?

568
00:42:43.583 --> 00:42:44.416
Come on. Get in.

569
00:42:45.041 --> 00:42:46.916
I'm not getting in. you dick.

570
00:42:50.541 --> 00:42:51.416
Say you're sorry.

571
00:42:54.583 --> 00:42:55.750
Sorry.

572
00:43:17.833 --> 00:43:18.666
What's this?

573
00:43:19.708 --> 00:43:20.541
A lotus flower.

574
00:43:21.541 --> 00:43:22.375
It's cool.

575
00:43:24.666 --> 00:43:28.083
It grows in garbage. in pond scum.

576
00:43:29.791 --> 00:43:31.250
But it never gets dirty. man.

577
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:37.875
I'm going to tell Poli
that we're together.

578
00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:41.750
As of tonight. I'm going solo.

579
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:47.875
Just saying that will get him real pissed.

580
00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:51.166
Well. fuck Poli.

581
00:43:53.458 --> 00:43:56.750
Don't get cocky… 
I don't want anything to happen to you.

582
00:43:58.500 --> 00:43:59.458
I'll be fine.

583
00:44:01.416 --> 00:44:02.416
I promise.

584
00:44:14.833 --> 00:44:15.666
Angelito.

585
00:44:19.083 --> 00:44:19.916
What's going on?

586
00:44:22.458 --> 00:44:24.250
Where are the fucking cars?

587
00:44:26.166 --> 00:44:28.583
Rogelio found out.
He thought it was me.

588
00:44:28.666 --> 00:44:31.166
Are you going solo?
What the fuck is going on?

589
00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:32.875
I got a tip on the place.

590
00:44:32.958 --> 00:44:34.791
Who'd you go with?

591
00:44:34.875 --> 00:44:36.541
You took my people without telling me?

592
00:44:36.625 --> 00:44:37.458
Your people?

593
00:44:38.375 --> 00:44:39.750
It's every man for himself.

594
00:44:40.333 --> 00:44:41.541
Every man for himself?

595
00:44:43.291 --> 00:44:44.791
Remind me the next time

596
00:44:44.875 --> 00:44:47.958
I have to pay Mercedes to get you
out of the can. OK. big man?

597
00:44:48.041 --> 00:44:49.500
Or did you forget about that?

598
00:44:50.125 --> 00:44:52.458
You put me in there.
Did you forget about that?

599
00:44:52.541 --> 00:44:55.541
I put you in there
and got you into the game.

600
00:44:56.291 --> 00:44:58.208
I taught you everything. smartass.

601
00:44:58.291 --> 00:44:59.125
Well.

602
00:45:00.041 --> 00:45:01.708
we can keep working together.

603
00:45:02.375 --> 00:45:03.500
If something comes up.

604
00:45:12.333 --> 00:45:13.458
Go fuck yourself.

605
00:45:14.916 --> 00:45:16.541
Is this what you want. Angelito?

606
00:45:17.333 --> 00:45:18.541
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

607
00:45:19.833 --> 00:45:22.208
That's just fucking great. kid.
Fucking great.

608
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:25.833
I'd be careful if I were you.

609
00:45:28.125 --> 00:45:29.958
Remember what I told you.

610
00:45:30.791 --> 00:45:32.791
Pissing off Rogelio is a bad idea.

611
00:45:34.166 --> 00:45:36.291
And he fucking hates people going solo.

612
00:46:20.625 --> 00:46:23.041
-Police!
-Police!

613
00:46:24.583 --> 00:46:25.833
-Clear!
-Clear!

614
00:46:28.916 --> 00:46:29.750
Clear!

615
00:46:32.375 --> 00:46:33.208
Clear!

616
00:46:42.375 --> 00:46:43.791
Fucking Rogelio!

617
00:46:43.875 --> 00:46:45.791
You see how that fucker snitched on us?

618
00:46:47.625 --> 00:46:49.291
They went into Nando's place. too.

619
00:46:50.125 --> 00:46:51.583
-What did they take?
-Some watches.

620
00:46:51.666 --> 00:46:53.958
God fucking damn it! I told him. man.

621
00:46:54.041 --> 00:46:55.916
If he wants something. he's gotta buy it.

622
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.208
This is ridiculous.
We can't work like this.

623
00:46:58.291 --> 00:47:01.083
-We gotta suck it up.
-"Suck it up"? Fuck that!

624
00:47:01.166 --> 00:47:02.875
Let's bust that fucker's head in!

625
00:47:02.958 --> 00:47:06.083
We can't. Gitano! OK? He's untouchable.

626
00:47:06.166 --> 00:47:08.083
"Untouchable"? Fuck that!

627
00:47:08.166 --> 00:47:10.875
Let's burn down
that asshole's warehouse and scrapyard!

628
00:47:10.958 --> 00:47:12.416
I'm telling you. we can't.

629
00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:14.625
That order didn't come
from some local cop.

630
00:47:15.333 --> 00:47:16.500
It came from higher up.

631
00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:18.583
from the brass.

632
00:47:19.458 --> 00:47:23.125
God damn it!
That prick Rogelio's got a nice setup.

633
00:47:39.791 --> 00:47:41.375
What the fuck is going on here?

634
00:47:41.458 --> 00:47:44.375
Three months of surveillance.
and these guys fuck up the operation.

635
00:47:44.458 --> 00:47:46.375
Alright. who authorized the search?

636
00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.083
OK. we're fucked.

637
00:48:40.791 --> 00:48:41.666
-Hi.
-Hey.

638
00:48:44.041 --> 00:48:44.875
Come in.

639
00:49:12.958 --> 00:49:16.250
Mercedes. I need him. OK?

640
00:49:16.333 --> 00:49:17.916
They're two fucking watches.

641
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.750
Can't you just say
they're not from the jeweler's?

642
00:49:20.833 --> 00:49:24.083
Ángel. they're worth over 3000 euros. OK?

643
00:49:24.666 --> 00:49:26.458
They're registered and numbered.

644
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.250
They know they're from that store.

645
00:49:29.333 --> 00:49:33.083
Can't you say
the search was illegal. or some shit?

646
00:49:33.708 --> 00:49:36.291
I'm sorry.
but they've got him by the balls.

647
00:49:36.375 --> 00:49:38.833
You don't know anyone
at the courthouse you can talk to?

648
00:49:38.916 --> 00:49:41.250
No. Ángel. Everything's legit over there.

649
00:49:41.333 --> 00:49:42.750
I do this for a living. OK?

650
00:49:50.125 --> 00:49:50.958
Ángel?

651
00:49:54.833 --> 00:49:58.250
Are you gonna convince her
by beating the shit out of her. too?

652
00:49:59.416 --> 00:50:00.625
Don't bust my balls!

653
00:50:02.541 --> 00:50:04.458
Why? 'Cause you taught me everything?

654
00:50:13.291 --> 00:50:15.250
I did everything but blow you.
you piece of shit!

655
00:50:17.583 --> 00:50:20.750
You think I'm gonna stop?
Wanna bet on it. asshole?

656
00:50:21.833 --> 00:50:22.833
Freeze!

657
00:50:23.833 --> 00:50:24.833
I said. "freeze"!

658
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:27.833
Let's go! Out!

659
00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:33.625
Where is he?

660
00:50:33.708 --> 00:50:36.000
He left. Five minutes ago.

661
00:50:36.833 --> 00:50:38.166
Have you lost your head?

662
00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:40.750
He'll lose his head
if he so much as touches her.

663
00:50:40.833 --> 00:50:42.291
What are you. a couple of kids?

664
00:50:42.375 --> 00:50:44.500
You're really going to throw it all away?

665
00:50:44.583 --> 00:50:46.500
For a girl? Come the fuck on. Ángel.

666
00:50:49.416 --> 00:50:50.875
We're talking. Where are you going?

667
00:50:50.958 --> 00:50:54.500
I gotta sort some shit out. Mercedes.
Get off my fucking back!

668
00:50:56.125 --> 00:50:57.833
-Angel.
-Alright. Mercedes!

669
00:50:57.916 --> 00:51:00.541
Just tell that piece of shit
to leave me alone. OK?

670
00:51:00.625 --> 00:51:02.125
To stay out of my fucking way!

671
00:51:02.833 --> 00:51:03.666
Jesus!

672
00:51:29.375 --> 00:51:30.458
Hey!

673
00:51:30.541 --> 00:51:31.625
Fancy seeing you here.

674
00:51:32.208 --> 00:51:33.166
I need a favor.

675
00:51:53.666 --> 00:51:56.125
-Good evening. Don Rogelio.
-Good evening. Manolo.

676
00:52:10.541 --> 00:52:13.208
…and we're trying to get into
the whole trading thing.

677
00:52:15.833 --> 00:52:18.125
We didn't know if you
were coming. so we started.

678
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.416
It's fine. I grabbed a bite.

679
00:52:21.916 --> 00:52:23.250
This is a friend of Sole's.

680
00:52:24.833 --> 00:52:25.708
Ángel. wasn't it?

681
00:52:26.916 --> 00:52:28.041
You know each other?

682
00:52:28.583 --> 00:52:29.416
A little.

683
00:52:32.166 --> 00:52:35.875
"Rogelio. maybe you can help us
with this stuff we swiped."

684
00:52:37.083 --> 00:52:39.708
"Rogelio. how much would you pay
for this cologne?"

685
00:52:41.375 --> 00:52:43.125
And Rogelio takes the cologne.

686
00:52:43.208 --> 00:52:45.416
He takes it all.
Even if it doesn't suit him.

687
00:52:46.625 --> 00:52:48.833
Even if he's up to
his ears in fucking cologne.

688
00:52:49.333 --> 00:52:50.833
Or athletic wear. or whatever.

689
00:52:51.666 --> 00:52:52.500
Why?

690
00:52:53.375 --> 00:52:55.000
You have to be there for people.

691
00:52:55.583 --> 00:52:58.166
That's the deal.
You scratch my back… Right?

692
00:52:58.791 --> 00:53:00.125
-Right. but Rogelio--
-But…

693
00:53:00.916 --> 00:53:02.875
Suddenly. something big comes along.

694
00:53:03.458 --> 00:53:04.291
Something good.

695
00:53:04.916 --> 00:53:06.125
Something fucking great.

696
00:53:07.041 --> 00:53:09.166
And Rogelio's no use anymore.

697
00:53:09.250 --> 00:53:12.125
"It's worth a shot.
Maybe our take will be bigger."

698
00:53:13.375 --> 00:53:14.416
And that's not OK.

699
00:53:15.791 --> 00:53:17.208
Because in this life. Ángel.

700
00:53:17.791 --> 00:53:19.000
as my father used to say.

701
00:53:19.083 --> 00:53:20.416
"You have to be grateful."

702
00:53:21.250 --> 00:53:22.666
"But. most importantly.

703
00:53:23.291 --> 00:53:25.375
do not be a son of a bitch.

704
00:53:29.666 --> 00:53:32.208
Don Rogelio.
I haven't sold the cars to anyone.

705
00:53:32.291 --> 00:53:34.541
Perfect. bring them to me
and it's sorted out.

706
00:53:36.458 --> 00:53:37.291
I need them.

707
00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:40.750
Seven fancy fucking cars?

708
00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:43.208
Are you starting a rally?

709
00:53:43.291 --> 00:53:44.208
That's why I came.

710
00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:48.083
To talk about what we're going to do.

711
00:53:48.666 --> 00:53:51.083
Oh. now you're telling me
what we're going to do?

712
00:53:51.166 --> 00:53:52.416
No.

713
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:54.041
You'll tell me.

714
00:53:55.791 --> 00:53:58.375
I'm done going out every night
to see what we can score.

715
00:53:59.208 --> 00:54:00.583
How much do warehouses cost?

716
00:54:00.666 --> 00:54:03.000
Or storing stuff you can't sell?

717
00:54:03.083 --> 00:54:04.666
-Or security?
-That's my problem.

718
00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:05.583
Well. mine. too.

719
00:54:06.583 --> 00:54:09.583
If. from now on. I bring you
exactly what you ask me to get.

720
00:54:12.416 --> 00:54:14.166
-Whatever I tell you?
-That's right.

721
00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:15.666
You tell me what they want.

722
00:54:16.916 --> 00:54:20.333
and I'll bring it to you…
By the time you get it. it's already sold.

723
00:54:21.583 --> 00:54:23.375
Deliver. get paid. done.

724
00:54:24.625 --> 00:54:25.708
That simple.

725
00:54:27.416 --> 00:54:28.625
That simple.

726
00:54:29.958 --> 00:54:30.791
That simple.

727
00:54:34.875 --> 00:54:35.708
Cheers.

728
00:55:18.833 --> 00:55:20.083
Don't panic.

729
00:55:20.166 --> 00:55:22.000
The security door! I'm calling the police!

730
00:55:23.791 --> 00:55:24.625
Go for it!

731
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:29.958
Hands up. bro! Get back!

732
00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:32.916
What are they doing?

733
00:55:34.125 --> 00:55:36.291
Right now! Hurry!

734
00:55:36.375 --> 00:55:39.083
-Everybody up!
-Up! Against the wall!

735
00:55:39.166 --> 00:55:41.041
-The keys!
-Get against the fucking wall!

736
00:55:41.125 --> 00:55:42.708
The fucking keys!

737
00:55:42.791 --> 00:55:44.458
Don't you move a fucking muscle!

738
00:55:45.083 --> 00:55:46.291
I'll blow your head off!

739
00:55:46.833 --> 00:55:47.708
Stay right there!

740
00:55:52.166 --> 00:55:53.208
The keys!

741
00:55:53.291 --> 00:55:54.708
Hurry the fuck up!

742
00:56:03.791 --> 00:56:05.250
Let's go!

743
00:56:05.333 --> 00:56:06.625
-One minute!
-Keep it up!

744
00:56:08.791 --> 00:56:10.458
-Go!
-C'mon. shit.

745
00:56:15.375 --> 00:56:17.250
Fuck! What the hell is going on?

746
00:56:20.125 --> 00:56:21.208
Let's go! Move it!

747
00:56:21.291 --> 00:56:23.291
I told you
to get against the fucking wall!

748
00:56:26.791 --> 00:56:27.625
Let's go.

749
00:56:32.416 --> 00:56:33.250
Let's go!

750
00:56:33.958 --> 00:56:35.291
Get out of the fucking way!

751
00:56:35.375 --> 00:56:36.250
The hard drives!

752
00:56:36.833 --> 00:56:37.958
Don't fucking move!

753
00:56:41.708 --> 00:56:42.875
Let's go! Outside!

754
00:57:29.416 --> 00:57:32.000
Christ! These kids are killin' me.
Did you see that?

755
00:57:32.083 --> 00:57:33.500
-Do you see that?
-These kids!

756
00:57:34.375 --> 00:57:36.125
HAVEN'T SEEN HIDE NOR HAIR OF YOU

757
00:57:36.208 --> 00:57:38.291
Holy shit! My Lord!

758
00:57:38.375 --> 00:57:39.416
I GOT IT CUT

759
00:57:40.041 --> 00:57:41.458
Now. that's an entrance!

760
00:57:41.541 --> 00:57:42.375
HAHAHA

761
00:57:42.875 --> 00:57:44.625
Hold on. Rewind.

762
00:57:44.708 --> 00:57:45.541
Thirty seconds!

763
00:57:45.625 --> 00:57:46.458
What?

764
00:57:47.708 --> 00:57:48.791
Thirty seconds!

765
00:57:50.291 --> 00:57:52.916
Yo. what the hell are you putting
in your pocket. bro?

766
00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:55.875
Can't you see. Motor?
A ring for my girl. A little ring.

767
00:57:55.958 --> 00:57:57.291
I'm giving it to her tonight.

768
00:57:57.791 --> 00:58:00.583
We said. "no taking stuff."
No taking stuff!

769
00:58:00.666 --> 00:58:03.083
If you want something.
buy it at a fucking store.

770
00:58:03.166 --> 00:58:04.166
Are you broke now?

771
00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:05.958
Oh. I got money. more than you.

772
00:58:06.041 --> 00:58:08.500
But if I want to take something
for my girl. I will.

773
00:58:08.583 --> 00:58:12.416
You know I'm still facing charges
for that shit. but you go and do it again.

774
00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:15.625
Look. I'm not the only asshole
who's done it. What's his deal--

775
00:58:15.708 --> 00:58:17.416
Shut your mouth. man!

776
00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:19.583
Listen. You know what's gonna happen now?

777
00:58:19.666 --> 00:58:21.833
-Alright. Motor. What?
-Don't you know?

778
00:58:21.916 --> 00:58:25.541
Bro. don't you know that those rings
have serial numbers that can be searched?

779
00:58:25.625 --> 00:58:27.041
Who cares about a search?

780
00:58:27.125 --> 00:58:29.625
She and I don't live together.
so they can't link us.

781
00:58:29.708 --> 00:58:31.583
Do you think the cops are stupid?

782
00:58:31.666 --> 00:58:33.416
How do you think they catch people?

783
00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:36.125
People like you. man?
How much time have you done?

784
00:58:36.291 --> 00:58:37.291
People like me…

785
00:58:38.833 --> 00:58:40.416
-Enough!
-Fuck you and your family!

786
00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:41.541
Calm the fuck down!

787
00:58:42.208 --> 00:58:43.333
-Calm down!
-Bring it.

788
00:58:43.416 --> 00:58:45.541
And you're a dumbass. OK?

789
00:58:45.625 --> 00:58:47.708
Leave the ring before you go. got it?

790
00:58:48.625 --> 00:58:50.083
-Got it?
-Yeah.

791
00:58:50.166 --> 00:58:51.041
There we go.

792
00:58:51.916 --> 00:58:53.875
All this over a fucking ring?
I'm the bad guy?

793
00:58:53.958 --> 00:58:55.833
Really. over some shitty ring?

794
00:58:55.916 --> 00:58:58.166
-That's enough. "shitty ring."
-Jesus fucking Christ.

795
00:58:58.250 --> 00:58:59.916
SUP CUTIE?

796
00:59:00.416 --> 00:59:02.041
WANNA CHILL?

797
00:59:02.708 --> 00:59:04.416
COME BY TODAY

798
00:59:19.625 --> 00:59:22.083
Tomorrow's my sister's First Communion.

799
00:59:23.083 --> 00:59:25.833
So. yeah… you should come. OK?

800
00:59:25.916 --> 00:59:26.958
My dad invited you.

801
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.291
Your dad wants me to go?

802
00:59:30.625 --> 00:59:32.541
Well. I want you to go.

803
00:59:32.625 --> 00:59:33.791
There it is!

804
00:59:34.333 --> 00:59:36.875
But my dad said "yes"
since he's a big fan of yours.

805
00:59:36.958 --> 00:59:38.375
I mean. he better fuckin' be.

806
00:59:38.458 --> 00:59:40.583
With all the cash I'm bringing in.
what can he say?

807
00:59:48.958 --> 00:59:51.875
-My cousins say you're a hunk.
-I hope they don't come on to me.

808
00:59:51.958 --> 00:59:54.125
I'd rip out their eyelashes.

809
00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:57.750
Who's that with your dad?

810
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.083
He's a cop.

811
01:00:00.166 --> 01:00:02.041
A cop? He doesn't look familiar.

812
01:00:02.958 --> 01:00:06.583
Of course. 'cause he's brass.
from Canillas. He doesn't work the street.

813
01:00:06.666 --> 01:00:07.583
Right.

814
01:00:09.250 --> 01:00:10.625
-I'm gonna see my sister. OK?
-OK.

815
01:00:10.708 --> 01:00:11.583
See you in a bit.

816
01:00:18.458 --> 01:00:20.000
-Hello?
-Mercedes.

817
01:00:21.291 --> 01:00:23.000
I just found out they busted Poli.

818
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.500
Ángel. I said I wouldn't discuss
that with you. OK?

819
01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:28.333
Right.

820
01:00:29.333 --> 01:00:30.875
But has he called you or not?

821
01:00:31.875 --> 01:00:34.208
I can't get him out
because he can't make bail.

822
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.166
Happy now?

823
01:00:38.375 --> 01:00:39.958
-Now he can.
-What?

824
01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:43.208
You heard me. now he can.
I'll give you the money. OK?

825
01:00:43.291 --> 01:00:45.375
But say it's from you.
you're spotting him.

826
01:00:45.458 --> 01:00:46.416
Keep me out of it.

827
01:00:47.166 --> 01:00:48.333
Ángel. don't. Got it?

828
01:00:48.416 --> 01:00:49.916
OK. Mercedes. Love you. too

829
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.208
-Ángel.
-Bye. sweetheart.

830
01:00:52.083 --> 01:00:55.083
-How are you. Ángel?
-Don Rogelio. thank you for inviting me.

831
01:00:55.166 --> 01:00:56.250
Hey. happy to.

832
01:00:56.875 --> 01:00:59.375
Listen up. This is important.

833
01:00:59.916 --> 01:01:01.583
Do you still have that lawyer?

834
01:01:03.208 --> 01:01:04.541
-Mercedes?
-Yeah. her.

835
01:01:05.208 --> 01:01:08.791
Well… if you could change lawyers.
that'd be fucking fantastic.

836
01:01:09.333 --> 01:01:10.416
You know what I mean?

837
01:01:11.708 --> 01:01:14.916
Or at least don't call her
about this stuff. if you catch my drift.

838
01:01:16.166 --> 01:01:17.166
Her phone's tapped?

839
01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:21.291
Someone at the court says she was paid off
or something like that.

840
01:01:21.375 --> 01:01:23.291
-This stays here.
-OK.

841
01:01:24.541 --> 01:01:25.375
Look.

842
01:01:31.041 --> 01:01:32.875
That's how I always want to see her.

843
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.416
with that smile on her face.

844
01:01:36.541 --> 01:01:37.958
Do you know what I'm saying?

845
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.708
Don't screw that up. OK. Angelito?

846
01:01:42.125 --> 01:01:43.541
Please. I'm asking nicely.

847
01:01:44.625 --> 01:01:46.041
I don't want to see her cry.

848
01:02:18.666 --> 01:02:22.250
WE'RE GOING ON A TRIP

849
01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:36.666
WHERE TO?

850
01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:42.958
IT'S A SURPRISE

851
01:02:43.041 --> 01:02:44.000
What are you doing?

852
01:02:44.583 --> 01:02:46.541
I fucking hate surprises.

853
01:02:47.375 --> 01:02:48.583
You'll like this one.

854
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:05.000
What is it?

855
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:07.916
You've been weird all day. Tell me.

856
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:08.833
Who? Me?

857
01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:12.750
It's like you want to tell me something.

858
01:03:15.541 --> 01:03:16.500
You're sick of me.

859
01:03:17.041 --> 01:03:18.958
No way. I can't get sick of you.

860
01:03:19.041 --> 01:03:19.916
So?

861
01:03:25.166 --> 01:03:26.000
What's wrong?

862
01:03:30.708 --> 01:03:31.541
There's a girl.

863
01:03:36.208 --> 01:03:37.458
Are you fucking her?

864
01:03:41.375 --> 01:03:42.541
I'm going to marry her.

865
01:03:52.125 --> 01:03:54.041
You brought me all this way
to tell me that?

866
01:03:55.916 --> 01:03:58.250
-Is she pregnant?
-No. of course not.

867
01:03:58.333 --> 01:04:01.250
So… you want to marry her.

868
01:04:01.333 --> 01:04:02.208
I'm fucked.

869
01:04:03.041 --> 01:04:03.875
Really fucked.

870
01:04:04.708 --> 01:04:06.833
I don't know how the hell I got here.

871
01:04:06.916 --> 01:04:10.416
No fucking idea…
But. right now. there's no turning back.

872
01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:12.500
-Are they threatening you?
-No. that's not it.

873
01:04:12.583 --> 01:04:14.500
No one's threatening me. There's no need.

874
01:04:14.583 --> 01:04:18.083
I've been on her father's bad side.
and it can't happen again.

875
01:04:18.166 --> 01:04:19.375
Her father?

876
01:04:19.458 --> 01:04:21.500
He's really connected… OK?

877
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.708
People that can instantly ruin your life.

878
01:04:24.916 --> 01:04:27.833
But if they're on your side…
Do you get it?

879
01:04:27.916 --> 01:04:29.166
No. I don't get it.

880
01:04:29.708 --> 01:04:30.666
It's not that hard.

881
01:04:31.625 --> 01:04:33.041
"It's not that hard"?

882
01:04:33.708 --> 01:04:35.208
Are you scared of 'em? Do you need 'em?

883
01:04:35.291 --> 01:04:37.958
It could take years to get to
where I want without his help.

884
01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:39.958
-Where do you want to get to?
-The top.

885
01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:41.541
As high as I can.

886
01:04:45.125 --> 01:04:46.500
Sky-high. right?

887
01:04:47.583 --> 01:04:48.416
Sky-high.

888
01:04:54.625 --> 01:04:55.958
You son of a bitch.

889
01:04:59.625 --> 01:05:01.250
Fine! What do you want me to do?

890
01:05:04.416 --> 01:05:05.291
Understand.

891
01:05:05.958 --> 01:05:06.958
And apart from that?

892
01:05:07.958 --> 01:05:09.375
You want to keep fucking me.

893
01:05:11.666 --> 01:05:12.666
That's it.

894
01:05:14.791 --> 01:05:15.625
Is that it?

895
01:05:18.291 --> 01:05:19.500
You son of a bitch!

896
01:05:20.416 --> 01:05:21.583
Fucking son of a bitch!

897
01:05:22.416 --> 01:05:23.833
What are you looking at. skank?

898
01:05:23.916 --> 01:05:25.041
What's that. bitch?

899
01:05:25.958 --> 01:05:27.791
Asshole! Motherfucker!

900
01:05:27.875 --> 01:05:28.708
Estrella!

901
01:05:29.291 --> 01:05:30.250
No.

902
01:05:31.541 --> 01:05:35.708
All this fancy bullshit.
just to tell me that. right?

903
01:05:36.208 --> 01:05:37.291
Fucking listen to me.

904
01:05:37.375 --> 01:05:39.208
"Listen to me" my ass!

905
01:05:40.375 --> 01:05:41.416
What?

906
01:05:43.041 --> 01:05:44.125
Open up!

907
01:05:44.208 --> 01:05:45.375
Estrella. please.

908
01:05:45.458 --> 01:05:48.791
Sure. like I'm gonna listen
to some fucking piece of shit.

909
01:05:48.875 --> 01:05:49.708
Oh. please!

910
01:05:50.291 --> 01:05:51.125
Please.

911
01:06:00.625 --> 01:06:01.458
Fuck!

912
01:06:40.875 --> 01:06:43.791
It does all the clubs on the island.
one after the other.

913
01:06:44.375 --> 01:06:46.250
Are you telling me that's two mill?

914
01:06:46.333 --> 01:06:47.166
Two mill?

915
01:06:48.333 --> 01:06:50.166
After a good weekend? Ten.

916
01:06:51.958 --> 01:06:54.083
How long does it take this heap
to get to Valencia?

917
01:06:54.750 --> 01:06:55.583
Five hours.

918
01:06:56.458 --> 01:06:58.541
We've got five hours for the whole thing.

919
01:06:59.041 --> 01:07:01.375
-In the middle of the sea?
-Like Sandokan. bro.

920
01:07:04.291 --> 01:07:05.416
What's up. dude?

921
01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:08.125
Listen. man.
I got something cool this week.

922
01:07:08.833 --> 01:07:10.500
and maybe you could help me out.

923
01:07:10.583 --> 01:07:12.791
I can't. man. I'm not in Madrid.

924
01:07:13.375 --> 01:07:15.583
-You're shittin' me. man.
-I'm in Ibiza.

925
01:07:15.666 --> 01:07:17.500
I'm working. I can't go.

926
01:07:17.583 --> 01:07:18.791
Are you with that asshole?

927
01:07:18.875 --> 01:07:22.083
I'll work with any asshole. Poli…
You're always the same. bro.

928
01:07:22.166 --> 01:07:23.875
-Work's work.
-What is it?

929
01:07:23.958 --> 01:07:25.708
You stealing jewels from some old lady?

930
01:07:25.791 --> 01:07:28.791
What old lady?
Just watch the news tomorrow. You'll see.

931
01:07:28.875 --> 01:07:30.375
It'll blow your mind.

932
01:08:07.041 --> 01:08:10.625
Excuse me. you can't stay here.
You have to be on the deck for the trip.

933
01:08:27.916 --> 01:08:30.833
Now we wait. At some point.
they'll have to make a move.

934
01:08:35.208 --> 01:08:37.750
Angelito. we've got two of them.
one on each side.

935
01:08:37.833 --> 01:08:40.250
And there'll be more. but don't sweat it.

936
01:08:40.333 --> 01:08:43.000
"Don't sweat it"?
I don't see it working.

937
01:08:43.583 --> 01:08:46.000
No way. Not on this ship.
with them here as well.

938
01:08:47.458 --> 01:08:49.458
Don't worry. OK?

939
01:08:49.541 --> 01:08:51.000
We stick to the plan.

940
01:08:51.083 --> 01:08:53.833
OK. Maybe this will
cough up something. It's dry.

941
01:08:53.916 --> 01:08:55.458
It won't give you shit.

942
01:08:55.541 --> 01:08:56.458
It's cold. man.

943
01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
DON'T THROw TRASH IN THE SEA

944
01:09:40.583 --> 01:09:42.583
Fernando. he's headed for the stern.

945
01:09:59.625 --> 01:10:01.416
Are those the cameras for the hold?

946
01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:02.333
Yes.

947
01:10:23.208 --> 01:10:24.041
I got something.

948
01:10:25.583 --> 01:10:27.458
-What?
-Some hippie is talking to him.

949
01:10:27.958 --> 01:10:29.958
Two hundred bucks for the backpack.

950
01:10:32.708 --> 01:10:33.541
Three hundred.

951
01:10:34.125 --> 01:10:34.958
Fine.

952
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.291
He's giving him a backpack.

953
01:10:39.375 --> 01:10:40.458
Fucking hell.

954
01:10:40.541 --> 01:10:41.791
What about the other guy?

955
01:10:42.458 --> 01:10:43.708
He's in the gift shop.

956
01:10:56.416 --> 01:10:57.666
He took the bag and left.

957
01:10:58.250 --> 01:10:59.250
Follow him.

958
01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:18.875
Let's bust them already.

959
01:11:18.958 --> 01:11:20.708
Nobody moves. Calm down.

960
01:11:20.791 --> 01:11:22.833
Bust him for what? Taking a backpack?

961
01:11:22.916 --> 01:11:25.291
All this shit for some fucking watches…

962
01:11:25.375 --> 01:11:28.833
No. that can't be it.
Come up to the bridge.

963
01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:41.333
See? They're both there.

964
01:11:48.291 --> 01:11:49.250
The car's gone.

965
01:11:50.541 --> 01:11:51.458
What do you mean?

966
01:11:51.541 --> 01:11:53.541
Our car was parked there. Now it's gone.

967
01:11:55.041 --> 01:11:56.958
Sit down. Eject the camera's hard drive.

968
01:12:01.083 --> 01:12:01.916
Son of a bitch!

969
01:12:02.791 --> 01:12:03.750
Stay right there!

970
01:12:11.958 --> 01:12:12.791
Let's go!

971
01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:15.625
To the hold!
Tell the others to grab Ángel!

972
01:13:03.416 --> 01:13:04.625
Son of a bitch!

973
01:13:38.833 --> 01:13:41.833
The car's coming. Tell me
when it gets here. I'll bring it over.

974
01:13:45.916 --> 01:13:47.833
Did the security guy recognize anyone?

975
01:13:48.333 --> 01:13:51.250
He says he was paid ten grand
to play last week's tape.

976
01:13:51.333 --> 01:13:52.583
but it wasn't these guys.

977
01:13:53.125 --> 01:13:55.000
His description doesn't match anyone.

978
01:13:56.166 --> 01:13:58.791
OK. see if you can get anything
out of the other one.

979
01:14:04.458 --> 01:14:05.375
I warned you.

980
01:14:06.125 --> 01:14:09.041
You could've gone straight.
but you didn't fucking listen.

981
01:14:09.125 --> 01:14:11.583
-I must be an idiot.
-Exactly.

982
01:14:11.666 --> 01:14:13.041
You're a fucking idiot.

983
01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:16.500
Another thieving lunatic
that goes around making messes.

984
01:14:16.583 --> 01:14:18.583
But do you know the worst part. Angelito?

985
01:14:18.666 --> 01:14:22.000
You think you're smarter
than everyone else. and… you're not.

986
01:14:23.375 --> 01:14:25.416
Isn't it a pain in the ass. Duque?

987
01:14:26.625 --> 01:14:27.458
What?

988
01:14:28.125 --> 01:14:29.750
Sitting there all fucking day.

989
01:14:30.333 --> 01:14:32.916
watching these lunatics live large.

990
01:14:34.166 --> 01:14:37.750
drive fancy cars and buy houses
that you can only dream about.

991
01:14:38.666 --> 01:14:41.083
But still. what you do is noble

992
01:14:41.166 --> 01:14:43.250
because now and then
your master comes by.

993
01:14:44.208 --> 01:14:45.750
pats you on the back

994
01:14:46.541 --> 01:14:48.041
and says. "Great job. Duque."

995
01:14:48.125 --> 01:14:51.541
"You're taking great fucking care
of our estate. you're hot shit."

996
01:14:51.625 --> 01:14:52.708
Don't change a thing.

997
01:14:54.333 --> 01:14:55.708
In the meantime.

998
01:14:56.541 --> 01:14:57.750
we'll fuck like rabbits.

999
01:14:58.708 --> 01:15:00.000
drink like fish.

1000
01:15:00.833 --> 01:15:03.666
and laugh our asses off
in your fucking face.

1001
01:15:06.708 --> 01:15:09.583
Go on. take this clown away
before I punch his lights out.

1002
01:15:16.250 --> 01:15:18.125
Please. Mercedes.

1003
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:21.666
Take down this number or remember it.

1004
01:15:22.416 --> 01:15:25.000
OK? Then call Estrella
and tell her what happened.

1005
01:15:25.875 --> 01:15:28.333
They're being really strict
about calls this time.

1006
01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:29.833
I spoke to her.

1007
01:15:33.666 --> 01:15:34.750
She's not interested.

1008
01:15:36.125 --> 01:15:37.875
-She called you?
-No.

1009
01:15:37.958 --> 01:15:38.791
I called her.

1010
01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:42.291
I didn't know where
you were and I had to find you.

1011
01:15:43.083 --> 01:15:45.125
-I'm an asshole.
-Yeah.

1012
01:15:46.125 --> 01:15:47.166
I agree.

1013
01:15:47.833 --> 01:15:49.666
You have to tell her to come see me.

1014
01:15:50.916 --> 01:15:53.041
I have to talk to her. I need to fix this.

1015
01:15:53.125 --> 01:15:56.500
Ángel. she asked me
to make it crystal clear that she's done.

1016
01:15:56.583 --> 01:15:59.166
Were those her words
or what it seemed like to you?

1017
01:16:01.375 --> 01:16:03.416
"Tell him to let me live my life

1018
01:16:04.166 --> 01:16:05.416
and to fuck off."

1019
01:16:06.291 --> 01:16:07.125
End quote.

1020
01:16:07.625 --> 01:16:08.708
That's what she said.

1021
01:16:09.291 --> 01:16:10.125
Right.

1022
01:16:11.375 --> 01:16:13.041
You have to think about yourself.

1023
01:16:13.125 --> 01:16:15.791
You're really fucked.
I'm telling you. seriously.

1024
01:16:15.875 --> 01:16:17.791
Fucked how? They've got nothing on us.

1025
01:16:17.875 --> 01:16:19.250
Can't a guy go to Valencia?

1026
01:16:20.291 --> 01:16:21.666
They're furious. OK?

1027
01:16:22.166 --> 01:16:23.541
You really pissed them off.

1028
01:16:24.250 --> 01:16:26.416
And. for now. the judge
has admitted the evidence.

1029
01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:29.541
But. I mean. I don't think
this will go anywhere.

1030
01:16:31.875 --> 01:16:33.500
There's something way bigger.

1031
01:16:35.583 --> 01:16:36.541
Gitano called.

1032
01:16:37.958 --> 01:16:38.958
It went wrong.

1033
01:16:55.666 --> 01:16:56.666
C'mon. Gitano.

1034
01:16:56.750 --> 01:16:58.750
-You've been in there an hour.
-Coming.

1035
01:16:59.916 --> 01:17:00.750
Nobody move!

1036
01:17:01.916 --> 01:17:03.333
Hey. bro! Easy!

1037
01:17:03.958 --> 01:17:05.291
God fucking damn it!

1038
01:17:06.291 --> 01:17:07.125
Freeze!

1039
01:17:07.250 --> 01:17:09.333
Relax. Shit. Relax!

1040
01:17:10.666 --> 01:17:11.750
Did you see the car?

1041
01:17:12.375 --> 01:17:14.875
We didn't see a thing.
They left us there tied up.

1042
01:17:14.958 --> 01:17:16.666
It was hours before we could move.

1043
01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.291
They knew about the house
or tailed you from the cove.

1044
01:17:20.375 --> 01:17:23.458
Nobody followed us. We're not that stupid.

1045
01:17:23.541 --> 01:17:25.625
And we drove all around
before we went in.

1046
01:17:25.708 --> 01:17:29.458
Fucking think. then.
When we were setting it up.

1047
01:17:29.541 --> 01:17:31.125
they must've spotted us.

1048
01:17:31.208 --> 01:17:34.250
For sure. They must've been
watching us. those fuckers.

1049
01:17:34.333 --> 01:17:36.541
Then wherever we went…

1050
01:17:36.625 --> 01:17:38.083
They went. too.

1051
01:17:39.333 --> 01:17:40.583
The port cameras.

1052
01:17:41.416 --> 01:17:42.750
We've got the hard drives.

1053
01:17:50.375 --> 01:17:51.250
There we are.

1054
01:17:59.541 --> 01:18:00.708
That fucking asshole!

1055
01:18:00.791 --> 01:18:01.916
Son of a bitch!

1056
01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.333
Fuck you and your fucking family!

1057
01:18:05.833 --> 01:18:06.708
Mercedes.

1058
01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:08.625
You have to find Poli.

1059
01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
We can't find him anywhere. He's hiding.

1060
01:18:13.208 --> 01:18:14.041
Talk to him.

1061
01:18:15.208 --> 01:18:17.875
OK? Tell him we'll work it out.

1062
01:18:17.958 --> 01:18:19.208
We'll split the money.

1063
01:18:22.375 --> 01:18:23.208
Ángel. I can't.

1064
01:18:23.833 --> 01:18:25.166
You're both my clients.

1065
01:18:25.708 --> 01:18:28.166
Yeah. Mercedes. Fine.
we're both your clients. OK.

1066
01:18:29.416 --> 01:18:31.458
Either we do it my way or I'll end him.

1067
01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:33.041
Got it?

1068
01:18:33.125 --> 01:18:35.500
Ángel. you shouldn't talk like that.

1069
01:18:36.250 --> 01:18:37.416
especially not in here.

1070
01:18:39.458 --> 01:18:40.916
I'm getting out of here soon.

1071
01:18:42.208 --> 01:18:43.708
And I'm getting married. OK?

1072
01:18:45.208 --> 01:18:46.375
I don't want bad blood.

1073
01:18:47.333 --> 01:18:49.708
But if the motherfucker wants war.

1074
01:18:50.291 --> 01:18:51.416
he'll get it.

1075
01:18:52.375 --> 01:18:55.750
I'll give him so much fucking war.
he'll be pissing and shitting it.

1076
01:18:56.833 --> 01:18:58.208
Do you get what I'm saying?

1077
01:19:09.166 --> 01:19:11.708
-Call me with the results.
-OK.

1078
01:19:13.041 --> 01:19:15.291
Poli's mixed up in the ferry thing.
He's still in Ibiza.

1079
01:19:15.375 --> 01:19:18.250
Mateo just told me. He has a tap on
the lawyer for something else.

1080
01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:20.333
-No shit.
-Yeah.

1081
01:19:21.583 --> 01:19:22.708
Start the operation.

1082
01:19:39.166 --> 01:19:40.041
Hold on.

1083
01:19:47.166 --> 01:19:48.166
Why the long face?

1084
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:49.833
Work stuff.

1085
01:19:50.666 --> 01:19:52.791
I don't even get a break
on my wedding day.

1086
01:19:55.083 --> 01:19:56.333
Not today. Ángel. please.

1087
01:19:57.458 --> 01:20:00.166
I won't be long.
I have to sort something out.

1088
01:20:01.833 --> 01:20:02.666
I promise.

1089
01:20:04.708 --> 01:20:05.541
Stop the car.

1090
01:20:08.291 --> 01:20:09.125
I'm sorry. OK?

1091
01:20:09.875 --> 01:20:10.708
I love you.

1092
01:20:56.208 --> 01:20:57.375
What's going on. Ángel?

1093
01:20:58.333 --> 01:20:59.458
I needed to see you.

1094
01:20:59.541 --> 01:21:02.500
-On your wedding day?
-I'm an asshole. I fucked up.

1095
01:21:02.583 --> 01:21:04.000
-No…
-Estrella. please.

1096
01:21:05.333 --> 01:21:07.166
I can't stop thinking about you.

1097
01:21:07.833 --> 01:21:09.291
-Let's just fucking leave.
-No.

1098
01:21:09.375 --> 01:21:10.708
-Let's go. you and me.
-No!

1099
01:21:10.833 --> 01:21:12.125
-Shut up!
-Estrella.

1100
01:21:13.916 --> 01:21:15.541
-I need you.
-You need me?

1101
01:21:15.625 --> 01:21:17.166
-Yes.
-You need me?

1102
01:21:18.333 --> 01:21:19.333
What about her dad?

1103
01:21:20.083 --> 01:21:20.916
Fuck him.

1104
01:21:21.041 --> 01:21:22.708
Now you're not scared of her dad?

1105
01:21:23.166 --> 01:21:24.791
Fuck it. Let them look for us.

1106
01:21:24.875 --> 01:21:26.041
-Fuck it?
-Fuck it--

1107
01:21:26.166 --> 01:21:29.333
No. You say that now. But later.
whenever you feel like it.

1108
01:21:29.416 --> 01:21:31.375
you'll remember the reasons and--

1109
01:21:31.458 --> 01:21:33.125
She's calling you. Can't you see?

1110
01:21:33.625 --> 01:21:36.166
And you're giving me
this spoiled brat bullshit!

1111
01:21:36.250 --> 01:21:38.333
-If it's bullshit. why are you here?
-What--

1112
01:21:38.416 --> 01:21:40.083
-Why did you come?
-Don't do this to me.

1113
01:21:40.166 --> 01:21:42.625
I fought hard to get this far.

1114
01:21:42.708 --> 01:21:43.625
I won't just leave--

1115
01:21:56.833 --> 01:21:58.666
-You have to go.
-I can't. Estrella.

1116
01:21:58.958 --> 01:22:00.625
-You have to go.
-Not without you.

1117
01:22:03.791 --> 01:22:05.208
Promise me we'll talk again.

1118
01:22:06.625 --> 01:22:08.708
Just promise you'll listen to me. please.

1119
01:22:23.666 --> 01:22:24.500
Go.

1120
01:22:25.166 --> 01:22:26.000
Go.

1121
01:22:26.083 --> 01:22:27.833
Promise me we'll see each other again.

1122
01:22:30.625 --> 01:22:31.875
Otherwise. I'm not going.

1123
01:22:45.708 --> 01:22:46.541
Hello?

1124
01:22:47.958 --> 01:22:49.500
Wait. say that again.

1125
01:23:01.083 --> 01:23:02.916
Fuck. Ángel. Where the hell were you?

1126
01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.083
I'm sorry. Really. I'm sorry.

1127
01:23:05.166 --> 01:23:06.333
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry…"

1128
01:23:07.375 --> 01:23:08.625
God damn it.

1129
01:23:08.708 --> 01:23:11.166
They busted Poli. The cops have him.

1130
01:23:12.041 --> 01:23:14.125
-It's for the ferry heist.
-And the money?

1131
01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.208
They can't find it.
They don't know where it is.

1132
01:23:17.291 --> 01:23:19.125
What about you? Are you going to Ibiza?

1133
01:23:19.208 --> 01:23:21.666
I don't know what the fuck
I'm going to do. Ángel.

1134
01:23:23.250 --> 01:23:24.625
You tell me. What do I do?

1135
01:23:26.666 --> 01:23:28.416
You asked me to make that call. right?

1136
01:23:28.958 --> 01:23:30.541
-Now they've arrested him.
-And?

1137
01:23:32.083 --> 01:23:33.083
When did you find out?

1138
01:23:34.125 --> 01:23:35.875
-What?
-That my phone was tapped.

1139
01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:39.041
You knew. and you didn't say shit.

1140
01:23:39.125 --> 01:23:41.541
If you want to imagine shit.
it's not my problem.

1141
01:23:42.333 --> 01:23:43.625
You didn't want a deal.

1142
01:23:44.291 --> 01:23:46.416
You wanted the cops to do the job for you.

1143
01:23:47.166 --> 01:23:48.000
to arrest him.

1144
01:23:49.375 --> 01:23:51.666
You're using us all. me worst of all--

1145
01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:54.666
No. Mercedes.
I'm not using you. I'm paying you!

1146
01:23:55.666 --> 01:23:57.250
So don't bust my balls!

1147
01:23:57.958 --> 01:24:01.041
Remember that
because that's what you want. right?

1148
01:24:01.583 --> 01:24:02.666
To keep getting paid.

1149
01:24:03.166 --> 01:24:04.291
Isn't that right?

1150
01:24:09.166 --> 01:24:10.000
Ángel.

1151
01:24:10.833 --> 01:24:11.666
What?

1152
01:24:14.541 --> 01:24:16.458
Your name came up in that conversation.

1153
01:24:17.375 --> 01:24:19.083
They're determined to get you now.

1154
01:24:20.083 --> 01:24:20.916
Just so you know.

1155
01:24:28.250 --> 01:24:29.250
To the happy couple!

1156
01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:00.666
Thanks a lot. Mercedes.

1157
01:25:02.208 --> 01:25:03.541
We'll sort it out later this week.

1158
01:25:03.625 --> 01:25:05.916
No. don't call me. I'll call you.

1159
01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:07.375
Trust me.

1160
01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.000
You got it.

1161
01:25:18.208 --> 01:25:19.250
-Poli!
-Get back!

1162
01:25:22.083 --> 01:25:23.041
-Please!
-Let's go.

1163
01:25:23.666 --> 01:25:24.500
Please!

1164
01:25:25.875 --> 01:25:27.500
-Please…
-Get back!

1165
01:25:27.583 --> 01:25:29.416
Please! Fuck!

1166
01:25:32.041 --> 01:25:34.166
Come on. move it.

1167
01:25:35.666 --> 01:25:37.000
Fuck!

1168
01:25:38.416 --> 01:25:40.833
Seven. three. six. three…

1169
01:25:58.458 --> 01:25:59.541
You can't hear a thing.

1170
01:25:59.625 --> 01:26:02.166
Motherfucker can't keep kicking
for three days.

1171
01:26:02.250 --> 01:26:04.166
He must be crispy.
in the sun and with no water.

1172
01:26:06.958 --> 01:26:08.750
Open it. I want to see his face.

1173
01:26:09.375 --> 01:26:10.291
You motherfuckers!

1174
01:26:11.583 --> 01:26:14.291
Eat shit and die. motherfucker!

1175
01:26:15.708 --> 01:26:16.791
Die. scumbag!

1176
01:26:26.375 --> 01:26:27.208
Your choice.

1177
01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:36.333
Get it out.

1178
01:27:35.208 --> 01:27:37.958
TWO YEARS LATER

1179
01:27:39.291 --> 01:27:41.458
Who's the most beautiful thing
in the world?

1180
01:27:42.250 --> 01:27:43.500
Come here. little man.

1181
01:27:48.708 --> 01:27:49.875
Here. Take him.

1182
01:27:51.416 --> 01:27:52.291
Hey there.

1183
01:27:53.166 --> 01:27:54.000
And your dad?

1184
01:27:54.625 --> 01:27:57.291
He's probably pissed off.
You know he hates the store stuff.

1185
01:27:57.375 --> 01:27:58.208
No. of course.

1186
01:27:58.916 --> 01:28:00.666
He's more into whorehouses.

1187
01:28:00.750 --> 01:28:03.000
-Ángel.
-I'll talk to him later.

1188
01:28:27.375 --> 01:28:29.583
-So glad to see you. Mercedes.
-Angelito.

1189
01:28:30.625 --> 01:28:32.041
Thanks for inviting me.

1190
01:28:32.958 --> 01:28:33.875
Are you still mad?

1191
01:28:35.208 --> 01:28:37.541
We're fine. Ángel.
Otherwise I wouldn't be here.

1192
01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:41.791
Great to see you.

1193
01:28:42.708 --> 01:28:43.541
Definitely.

1194
01:28:45.625 --> 01:28:47.208
This is what you wanted. right?

1195
01:28:47.958 --> 01:28:50.291
Legal business. all above board.

1196
01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:54.750
You'll need lots more
to get you-know-what into circulation.

1197
01:28:55.375 --> 01:28:57.083
-Little by little.
-Yeah.

1198
01:28:59.166 --> 01:29:02.208
If you need help. I have
someone who can lend a hand.

1199
01:29:02.875 --> 01:29:03.708
Powerful people.

1200
01:29:03.791 --> 01:29:06.500
People who move money. launder it.

1201
01:29:08.208 --> 01:29:09.416
That'd be fucking great.

1202
01:29:10.666 --> 01:29:12.791
Alright… I'll drop you a line Monday?

1203
01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:17.458
Yeah. Monday's fine. Give me a second.

1204
01:29:22.458 --> 01:29:23.791
What the fuck is going on?

1205
01:29:24.583 --> 01:29:25.875
What do you think?

1206
01:29:26.458 --> 01:29:28.666
Take it easy.
It's not about you this time.

1207
01:29:28.750 --> 01:29:30.791
-You don't have shit on me.
-Oh. no?

1208
01:29:31.375 --> 01:29:33.041
Ask your bank manager. Go on.

1209
01:29:33.125 --> 01:29:34.583
You can't just open a safe deposit--

1210
01:29:35.083 --> 01:29:37.250
-Shut up.
-You can with a warrant like this.

1211
01:29:38.125 --> 01:29:40.375
Possession of funds of undeclared origin.

1212
01:29:40.458 --> 01:29:42.625
possible laundering… You've got it all.

1213
01:29:43.416 --> 01:29:46.083
You've got a lot of
explaining to do. Angelito.

1214
01:29:46.166 --> 01:29:48.541
-Ángel. what do we do?
-Nothing. relax. go home.

1215
01:29:49.041 --> 01:29:50.291
I'll take care of it. OK?

1216
01:29:50.791 --> 01:29:52.458
-I'll see you at the station.
-OK.

1217
01:29:52.541 --> 01:29:54.500
Couldn't you have picked another time?

1218
01:29:54.583 --> 01:29:55.958
Yes. we could've…

1219
01:29:57.041 --> 01:29:58.416
Listen. I need a favor.

1220
01:29:59.208 --> 01:30:01.958
Mercedes. this can't happen.
The store's full of press…

1221
01:30:02.041 --> 01:30:04.416
I'm on it.
I need to take this. Hey. listen…

1222
01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:06.541
Enough with the cameras! Cut that out!

1223
01:30:25.583 --> 01:30:26.583
What's up. Angelito?

1224
01:30:28.333 --> 01:30:29.458
Long time no see. huh?

1225
01:30:32.291 --> 01:30:33.791
Damn. nice tattoo.

1226
01:30:36.166 --> 01:30:37.708
I didn't know you were inside.

1227
01:30:37.791 --> 01:30:40.291
That's weird.
Your lawyer didn't run and tell you?

1228
01:30:43.541 --> 01:30:44.541
Hey.

1229
01:30:45.833 --> 01:30:47.083
is it true what they say?

1230
01:30:48.708 --> 01:30:50.666
I've got no fucking idea what they say.

1231
01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:51.583
The cops.

1232
01:30:52.625 --> 01:30:54.250
They say they took all the cash.

1233
01:30:55.625 --> 01:30:57.791
And you get locked up… for saving money.

1234
01:30:57.875 --> 01:30:59.333
What do you want. Poli?

1235
01:30:59.958 --> 01:31:00.791
To talk.

1236
01:31:02.041 --> 01:31:04.208
Tell him to go.
and we'll talk all you want.

1237
01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Wait outside for me.

1238
01:31:11.666 --> 01:31:12.500
Can I sit?

1239
01:31:25.375 --> 01:31:26.791
You really fucked me. Ángel.

1240
01:31:28.750 --> 01:31:31.000
-Well. you robbed me after I…
-After you what?

1241
01:31:33.208 --> 01:31:34.666
After you posted bail for me?

1242
01:31:36.666 --> 01:31:38.041
It wasn't just that. right?

1243
01:31:39.125 --> 01:31:41.708
All those times Mercedes lent me money…

1244
01:31:41.791 --> 01:31:42.958
That bitch.

1245
01:31:43.666 --> 01:31:45.250
She shouldn't have told you.

1246
01:31:45.333 --> 01:31:46.166
Sure.

1247
01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:48.750
She was afraid

1248
01:31:49.791 --> 01:31:51.916
that I'd come for you
if you were ever locked up.

1249
01:31:53.625 --> 01:31:54.666
And was she right?

1250
01:32:00.166 --> 01:32:01.458
I'm gonna pay you back.

1251
01:32:03.583 --> 01:32:04.500
All of it.

1252
01:32:04.583 --> 01:32:06.041
to the last fucking euro.

1253
01:32:08.666 --> 01:32:09.500
How?

1254
01:32:10.375 --> 01:32:11.208
From my cut.

1255
01:32:13.416 --> 01:32:15.791
From a job we'll do together.
What do you say?

1256
01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:24.583
Marcos.

1257
01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:28.416
These are the guys I told you about.

1258
01:32:31.583 --> 01:32:35.083
Limón says you want to talk business.
but there's a problem. bro.

1259
01:32:35.583 --> 01:32:37.583
-What's that?
-I don't work with strangers.

1260
01:32:37.666 --> 01:32:40.083
And I don't know you at all. So. bye.

1261
01:32:41.125 --> 01:32:42.250
Five hundred kilos.

1262
01:32:45.291 --> 01:32:47.166
The same ones the cops took from you.

1263
01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:55.916
What do you know about that?

1264
01:32:57.708 --> 01:32:58.791
What Limón told me.

1265
01:32:59.458 --> 01:33:00.666
Someone talked too much.

1266
01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:03.291
And the cops kept the blow.

1267
01:33:04.208 --> 01:33:05.666
But he also told me something

1268
01:33:06.458 --> 01:33:08.333
that got me thinking. Right. man?

1269
01:33:10.291 --> 01:33:13.000
I told him the truth.
that the fuckers burn it.

1270
01:33:13.833 --> 01:33:15.375
With what it takes to get it here--

1271
01:33:15.458 --> 01:33:18.250
It's true. they burn it…
And that fucking sucks.

1272
01:33:19.583 --> 01:33:21.833
But they only do it
in three places in Spain.

1273
01:33:22.708 --> 01:33:25.208
And until the day comes.
it's kept in warehouses

1274
01:33:25.291 --> 01:33:26.541
that are on the down-low.

1275
01:33:27.333 --> 01:33:28.583
Like the one in Valencia.

1276
01:33:34.458 --> 01:33:35.333
Good evening.

1277
01:33:39.583 --> 01:33:41.541
There's a little warehouse at the port.

1278
01:33:42.416 --> 01:33:44.666
They keep all the goods there.

1279
01:33:44.750 --> 01:33:46.583
The cops guard it. don't they?

1280
01:33:46.666 --> 01:33:47.500
No.

1281
01:33:48.125 --> 01:33:50.541
A private security company does.

1282
01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:56.875
And only on weekdays.
There's nobody on Saturday or Sunday.

1283
01:33:56.958 --> 01:33:59.166
Just cameras and alarms.

1284
01:33:59.250 --> 01:34:01.375
And we'll take care of that.

1285
01:34:01.458 --> 01:34:03.708
-That seems too easy. bro.
-It's not.

1286
01:34:04.708 --> 01:34:07.875
But if you've got the right tools.
it can be done.

1287
01:34:21.791 --> 01:34:22.875
Oh. my God!

1288
01:34:23.458 --> 01:34:26.625
Then you load it in a van
and go. nice and quiet.

1289
01:34:35.458 --> 01:34:36.375
Have a good night.

1290
01:34:37.541 --> 01:34:38.708
Take it easy.

1291
01:34:42.833 --> 01:34:44.833
MAINTENANCE - QUICK SERVICE

1292
01:34:49.541 --> 01:34:50.541
Marcos sent you?

1293
01:34:50.666 --> 01:34:51.666
Get in.

1294
01:35:41.458 --> 01:35:43.333
Gitano's outside. He'll take the car.

1295
01:35:44.208 --> 01:35:45.625
He'll handle everything.

1296
01:35:46.208 --> 01:35:47.041
I'll do it.

1297
01:35:47.125 --> 01:35:49.541
Fuck no. Sole. You did your part.

1298
01:35:49.625 --> 01:35:52.625
Gitano's got a record as long as your arm.
Are we sure he wasn't tailed?

1299
01:35:52.708 --> 01:35:53.541
If he was.

1300
01:35:53.625 --> 01:35:55.666
he would've lost it by now.

1301
01:35:56.458 --> 01:35:58.625
I'm not risking it.
Tell me where. I'll take it.

1302
01:35:59.541 --> 01:36:01.583
Sole. don't give me shit.

1303
01:36:02.833 --> 01:36:05.291
I won't rip her eyes out.
if that's what you think.

1304
01:36:08.125 --> 01:36:08.958
I know your spot.

1305
01:36:09.041 --> 01:36:12.000
Every time you make up a story.
you disappear for a few days with her.

1306
01:36:12.083 --> 01:36:13.500
But that doesn't matter now.

1307
01:36:16.416 --> 01:36:19.416
Give me the fucking address
or I get out of the car. and it's over.

1308
01:36:21.708 --> 01:36:22.541
Write it down.

1309
01:36:23.958 --> 01:36:25.166
Don't put it in the GPS.

1310
01:36:50.708 --> 01:36:52.083
He told me you were coming.

1311
01:36:53.833 --> 01:36:54.958
The hiding spot?

1312
01:36:55.041 --> 01:36:55.916
Over by the dogs.

1313
01:36:57.166 --> 01:36:58.041
Come on.

1314
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:05.833
This way.

1315
01:37:21.541 --> 01:37:22.375
Ready.

1316
01:37:23.291 --> 01:37:24.125
Here comes one…

1317
01:37:27.708 --> 01:37:28.583
and the other.

1318
01:37:55.375 --> 01:37:56.583
You're very pretty.

1319
01:38:00.750 --> 01:38:01.583
Thanks.

1320
01:38:06.041 --> 01:38:07.875
He has a photo of you on his phone.

1321
01:38:08.583 --> 01:38:10.000
but it doesn't do you justice.

1322
01:38:12.291 --> 01:38:14.000
No wonder he's in love with you.

1323
01:38:17.541 --> 01:38:19.333
He married you. Sole.

1324
01:38:23.041 --> 01:38:24.250
Why do you think that is?

1325
01:38:27.291 --> 01:38:28.125
I don't know.

1326
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:31.166
What do you think?

1327
01:38:33.083 --> 01:38:34.333
I'd give my life for him.

1328
01:38:35.666 --> 01:38:36.625
For him and my son.

1329
01:38:38.333 --> 01:38:39.166
And he knows it.

1330
01:38:41.958 --> 01:38:42.791
He sure does.

1331
01:38:44.750 --> 01:38:45.583
Quite the setup.

1332
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.541
ONE YEAR LATER

1333
01:39:04.958 --> 01:39:06.416
-Mercedes.
-Álvaro.

1334
01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:08.250
-How are you?
-How's it going?

1335
01:39:08.333 --> 01:39:09.416
All good.

1336
01:39:09.541 --> 01:39:10.875
Thanks for seeing us.

1337
01:39:10.958 --> 01:39:12.666
Please. That's what we're here for.

1338
01:39:12.750 --> 01:39:14.750
Head on in. and I'll be right with you.

1339
01:39:14.833 --> 01:39:15.750
OK. No problem.

1340
01:39:26.375 --> 01:39:28.041
Would you like coffee. water?

1341
01:39:28.125 --> 01:39:29.416
No. nothing. Thanks.

1342
01:39:30.333 --> 01:39:31.750
Ángel. do you want anything?

1343
01:39:32.750 --> 01:39:33.583
Nothing. thanks.

1344
01:39:49.166 --> 01:39:50.125
They're like ants.

1345
01:39:54.791 --> 01:39:55.666
Alright. Ángel.

1346
01:39:56.416 --> 01:39:59.666
Let's say… you have funds from "X"

1347
01:39:59.750 --> 01:40:02.708
that. for now.
we'll say are hard to justify.

1348
01:40:02.791 --> 01:40:04.083
-Agreed?
-Correct.

1349
01:40:04.166 --> 01:40:05.125
Good.

1350
01:40:05.208 --> 01:40:07.333
And you could divert them
to an offshore account.

1351
01:40:07.416 --> 01:40:11.541
Yes. we can make sure
there's absolutely no paper trail.

1352
01:40:12.666 --> 01:40:14.416
We set up different companies.

1353
01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:16.791
Of course. you wouldn't own them on paper.

1354
01:40:16.875 --> 01:40:19.791
And we'd make transfers
to different places.

1355
01:40:19.875 --> 01:40:20.958
so there's no trace.

1356
01:40:21.625 --> 01:40:22.958
That's basically it.

1357
01:40:23.458 --> 01:40:26.833
Your money's safe in Singapore.
the Bahamas. wherever you like.

1358
01:40:27.208 --> 01:40:28.291
Minus fees. of course.

1359
01:40:28.375 --> 01:40:30.875
There would just be
the financial engineering costs.

1360
01:40:30.958 --> 01:40:32.833
Well. it's not cheap. I'm not gonna lie.

1361
01:40:33.291 --> 01:40:36.000
So if I want my money.
I have to go to Singapore?

1362
01:40:36.625 --> 01:40:38.583
No… Ángel. No.

1363
01:40:38.666 --> 01:40:39.875
Tell him about the Chinese.

1364
01:40:39.958 --> 01:40:40.791
Yes.

1365
01:40:40.875 --> 01:40:43.375
They don't pay taxes. Ángel.
They have so much dirty money.

1366
01:40:43.458 --> 01:40:44.875
they don't know what to do with it.

1367
01:40:44.958 --> 01:40:46.500
Let's see if I can explain. Look…

1368
01:40:47.333 --> 01:40:52.166
They generate… all this capital
every month. undeclared. OK?

1369
01:40:53.041 --> 01:40:55.208
They want to take it
from here to their country

1370
01:40:55.291 --> 01:40:56.791
without paying any taxes.

1371
01:40:57.875 --> 01:40:59.916
So. we tell them.

1372
01:41:00.791 --> 01:41:04.916
"Don't transfer
a little bit every month. nice and slow."

1373
01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.583
"It's a pain in the ass.
and you'll get caught."

1374
01:41:07.666 --> 01:41:08.833
"Leave it to me."

1375
01:41:08.916 --> 01:41:12.750
"I'll give my clients
as much as they need at any given time."

1376
01:41:14.250 --> 01:41:16.041
Then the clients make transfers

1377
01:41:16.125 --> 01:41:17.791
from their accounts outside of Spain.

1378
01:41:18.333 --> 01:41:19.958
You send an email and that's it.

1379
01:41:20.583 --> 01:41:21.958
The money's now in China.

1380
01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:24.875
The Chinese give you cash.

1381
01:41:24.958 --> 01:41:25.958
That's right. Ángel.

1382
01:41:26.708 --> 01:41:27.541
Monthly.

1383
01:41:28.041 --> 01:41:31.958
Then I give my client the money
they ask for at any given time.

1384
01:41:32.708 --> 01:41:34.541
No taxes. no transfers.

1385
01:41:35.833 --> 01:41:37.666
Tell them what you want.
and they deliver it.

1386
01:41:38.333 --> 01:41:39.208
Like Telepizza.

1387
01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:41.750
-Isn't that great?
-Great?

1388
01:41:42.833 --> 01:41:43.916
It's fucking amazing.

1389
01:42:06.416 --> 01:42:08.083
Look. there are the Chinese.

1390
01:42:08.166 --> 01:42:09.541
We've identified that one.

1391
01:42:09.625 --> 01:42:12.958
The first is Zou Xian.
and the second is Hai Zou.

1392
01:42:13.041 --> 01:42:14.541
Two money laundering bids.

1393
01:42:16.166 --> 01:42:18.000
We're sure something's on for today?

1394
01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:20.250
They could be scoping it out again.

1395
01:42:20.333 --> 01:42:22.333
No. it's today. We got the intel.

1396
01:42:41.541 --> 01:42:42.958
Look who it is!

1397
01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:45.416
Who loves Rogelio?

1398
01:42:47.458 --> 01:42:49.208
Strong as a bull. growing every day.

1399
01:42:49.708 --> 01:42:51.958
That's right.
The punk eats more than his dad.

1400
01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:55.250
By the way. did you bring your car?

1401
01:42:55.750 --> 01:42:56.666
Yes.

1402
01:42:56.750 --> 01:42:57.583
Then follow me.

1403
01:43:07.291 --> 01:43:08.666
-Where's Ángel?
-In a park.

1404
01:43:08.750 --> 01:43:11.083
Don't trust the dot.
He could've given someone the car.

1405
01:43:11.750 --> 01:43:12.708
Confirm visual.

1406
01:43:13.541 --> 01:43:14.375
It's him.

1407
01:43:14.458 --> 01:43:16.916
I'm looking at him.
He's with his father-in-law.

1408
01:43:34.875 --> 01:43:36.666
Who's that guy? The short one.

1409
01:43:37.333 --> 01:43:38.500
No one. small potatoes.

1410
01:43:38.583 --> 01:43:41.666
A lawyer. He's keeping an eye on things
for the big shots.

1411
01:43:42.250 --> 01:43:43.708
Do we know the room yet?

1412
01:43:43.791 --> 01:43:45.958
The head of reception said it's 550.

1413
01:44:08.833 --> 01:44:10.750
I told you some time ago.

1414
01:44:11.625 --> 01:44:13.500
Remember? "Stay away from that bitch."

1415
01:44:14.250 --> 01:44:16.875
But no… You think you're
smarter than all of us put together.

1416
01:44:16.958 --> 01:44:17.791
But you fucked up.

1417
01:44:17.875 --> 01:44:19.500
If you so much as touch her--

1418
01:44:20.416 --> 01:44:22.291
You got me wrong. I don't mean her.

1419
01:44:22.791 --> 01:44:25.083
I mean the other bitch. the lawyer.

1420
01:44:25.666 --> 01:44:26.500
Mercedes?

1421
01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:28.416
What the fuck's up with Mercedes?

1422
01:44:28.500 --> 01:44:29.708
She just left for Paris.

1423
01:44:30.791 --> 01:44:33.708
Clearly. she doesn't want to be
around the next few hours. Why's that?

1424
01:44:33.791 --> 01:44:35.250
I don't know. you tell me.

1425
01:44:35.333 --> 01:44:38.291
Well. maybe it's related to the call
she made the other day.

1426
01:44:39.416 --> 01:44:42.208
They're still tapping her phone
'cause of the court thing.

1427
01:44:42.875 --> 01:44:43.791
She's real sloppy.

1428
01:44:44.791 --> 01:44:46.833
Talking on the phone about the Chinese.

1429
01:44:47.833 --> 01:44:49.708
The hotel
where the exchange is. all of it.

1430
01:44:50.291 --> 01:44:51.875
And that's not the worst part.

1431
01:44:51.958 --> 01:44:55.125
She has this strange idea
that you're going to rob them.

1432
01:44:59.291 --> 01:45:02.458
If anything happens to my daughter
because you fucked up. Ángel.

1433
01:45:03.541 --> 01:45:04.916
I swear I'll kill you.

1434
01:45:09.916 --> 01:45:12.250
See you. champ.
Don't forget about Grandad. OK?

1435
01:45:18.458 --> 01:45:20.583
He's moving. He's moving.

1436
01:45:35.708 --> 01:45:36.708
There's no visual.

1437
01:45:36.791 --> 01:45:37.625
No visual?

1438
01:45:38.125 --> 01:45:40.750
The fifth-floor camera is dead.
It's not working.

1439
01:45:41.291 --> 01:45:42.708
Someone to five. now.

1440
01:45:52.708 --> 01:45:53.750
Call Sole.

1441
01:45:54.458 --> 01:45:55.666
Calling Sole.

1442
01:46:45.125 --> 01:46:46.750
NOW

1443
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:55.041
NOW

1444
01:47:14.041 --> 01:47:14.875
Fuck!

1445
01:47:23.083 --> 01:47:24.291
Come on. damn it!

1446
01:47:31.583 --> 01:47:32.416
Yeah?

1447
01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:34.750
-Sole!
-I can't find the briefcases.

1448
01:47:35.250 --> 01:47:36.416
Forget it! Get out!

1449
01:47:37.041 --> 01:47:38.750
-What?
-Get the fuck out!

1450
01:47:38.833 --> 01:47:40.083
The cops are there!

1451
01:47:41.833 --> 01:47:42.666
I got 'em.

1452
01:47:43.541 --> 01:47:44.416
No. Sole! Fuck!

1453
01:47:45.166 --> 01:47:46.000
Sole!

1454
01:48:09.041 --> 01:48:10.666
GO

1455
01:48:44.833 --> 01:48:46.250
Fucking hell.

1456
01:48:46.333 --> 01:48:48.541
-A woman came out.
-A woman?

1457
01:48:48.625 --> 01:48:50.750
With a suitcase.
heading for the elevators.

1458
01:48:56.625 --> 01:48:57.458
It's his wife.

1459
01:49:03.500 --> 01:49:05.625
She went in the elevator.
and three guys came out.

1460
01:49:05.708 --> 01:49:06.541
Arrest them!

1461
01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:13.833
Freeze! Police!

1462
01:49:14.458 --> 01:49:15.833
Hands against the wall.

1463
01:49:16.875 --> 01:49:18.541
Ángel will be here in a minute.

1464
01:49:19.333 --> 01:49:20.291
Let's go.

1465
01:49:20.375 --> 01:49:22.208
We have to arrest all of them. Now!

1466
01:49:42.416 --> 01:49:45.916
Stop! Hold it! Don't move!
You're under arrest!

1467
01:49:47.416 --> 01:49:49.375
-We've got him.
-Hands behind your back.

1468
01:49:49.458 --> 01:49:51.166
Hands behind your back!

1469
01:50:10.291 --> 01:50:11.125
Keep looking.

1470
01:50:17.375 --> 01:50:18.208
Anything?

1471
01:50:19.333 --> 01:50:20.875
Keep looking. It has to be here.

1472
01:50:23.958 --> 01:50:24.875
They found her.

1473
01:50:26.166 --> 01:50:27.625
Service elevator. Empty-handed.

1474
01:50:48.333 --> 01:50:49.250
You have a son.

1475
01:50:50.333 --> 01:50:51.958
What the hell were you thinking?

1476
01:50:54.208 --> 01:50:55.708
What do we tell your father?

1477
01:50:56.625 --> 01:50:59.708
That you're going to cooperate.
that he tricked you. what?

1478
01:51:04.791 --> 01:51:05.916
I want to make a call.

1479
01:51:07.750 --> 01:51:09.000
Don't I have the right?

1480
01:51:41.916 --> 01:51:42.750
Hello?

1481
01:51:43.625 --> 01:51:45.875
Estrella. do you know who this is?

1482
01:51:47.250 --> 01:51:48.083
Yes.

1483
01:51:48.583 --> 01:51:50.541
OK. listen to me.
We don't have much time.

1484
01:51:51.041 --> 01:51:53.625
I'm at a police station.
under arrest. with him.

1485
01:51:54.625 --> 01:51:57.166
You need to get two bags
from the Hotel Miguel Ángel.

1486
01:51:58.041 --> 01:52:00.416
No. that's not my business.
That's fucking crazy.

1487
01:52:01.166 --> 01:52:02.708
Do you want to help Ángel or not?

1488
01:52:04.875 --> 01:52:05.708
Not like that.

1489
01:52:07.375 --> 01:52:09.041
There has to be another way.

1490
01:52:09.125 --> 01:52:11.500
Do you think I'd be talking
to you if there was?

1491
01:52:12.083 --> 01:52:13.958
We're fucked if they find that money.

1492
01:52:14.458 --> 01:52:15.875
Well. that's not my problem.

1493
01:52:18.750 --> 01:52:20.083
They'll put him in prison.

1494
01:52:20.583 --> 01:52:22.125
This time for a long time.

1495
01:52:25.541 --> 01:52:26.625
What do I have to do?

1496
01:52:28.666 --> 01:52:31.291
OK. When you get there.
go into the garage.

1497
01:52:32.291 --> 01:52:35.083
They'll have finished searching.
There should be no cops.

1498
01:52:35.666 --> 01:52:38.750
There's a storeroom
for the bags people leave behind.

1499
01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:42.583
I left a keycard that opens it
in the fire extinguisher case nearby.

1500
01:52:43.125 --> 01:52:43.958
OK.

1501
01:52:44.041 --> 01:52:46.416
You'll see two briefcases
at the top on the right.

1502
01:52:46.958 --> 01:52:48.875
Do I take them to the spot?

1503
01:52:48.958 --> 01:52:50.041
Yes. hide them there.

1504
01:52:52.791 --> 01:52:53.625
Hey. Estrella.

1505
01:52:54.250 --> 01:52:55.083
What?

1506
01:52:56.833 --> 01:52:59.541
When he gets out this time
I want you two to leave. OK?

1507
01:53:02.083 --> 01:53:04.166
Take the fucking money and disappear.

1508
01:53:04.958 --> 01:53:05.791
Sole.

1509
01:53:08.291 --> 01:53:10.291
If I do this.
it's not 'cause of that. you know?

1510
01:53:12.958 --> 01:53:14.583
Isn't it what he's always wanted?

1511
01:53:15.333 --> 01:53:16.458
Since our wedding day.

1512
01:53:20.083 --> 01:53:21.166
But.

1513
01:53:22.125 --> 01:53:24.166
understand I'm keeping a part of him.

1514
01:53:25.500 --> 01:53:26.333
All for me.

1515
01:53:26.916 --> 01:53:29.083
The most beautiful part.
which has his eyes.

1516
01:53:32.791 --> 01:53:35.666
Before you leave the garage.
destroy your SIM card.

1517
01:53:36.666 --> 01:53:37.708
He could find you.

1518
01:53:38.291 --> 01:53:39.166
That cop?

1519
01:53:42.458 --> 01:53:43.291
My father.

1520
01:56:52.541 --> 01:56:54.666
Let's go and never come back

1521
01:56:54.750 --> 01:56:56.916
And if we do. it'll be to make it rain

1522
01:56:57.416 --> 01:56:59.583
Let's get out of here
I don't want to wait

1523
01:57:00.125 --> 01:57:02.333
Heaven is somewhere else

1524
01:57:02.416 --> 01:57:04.875
They want my time but I'm all out

1525
01:57:04.958 --> 01:57:06.666
I'm gitana. so I got rhythm

1526
01:57:07.291 --> 01:57:09.541
Working all day. no rest

1527
01:57:09.625 --> 01:57:11.875
I'm in no mood for anyone
I can't get married

1528
01:57:11.958 --> 01:57:13.541
Before I die. another skin

1529
01:57:14.041 --> 01:57:16.375
Before I die. I'm born again

1530
01:57:16.458 --> 01:57:18.625
Before I die. kill me

1531
01:57:18.708 --> 01:57:21.125
Before I go. I want a thousand times

1532
01:57:21.208 --> 01:57:23.791
And you too. and you too

Before I die

1535
01:57:27.375 --> 01:57:28.708
Before dying

1536
01:57:30.791 --> 01:57:33.041
I don't wanna do the right thing

1537
01:57:33.833 --> 01:57:35.875
Ain't got time for that shit

1538
01:57:35.958 --> 01:57:38.333
You won't hear me whining

1539
01:57:38.416 --> 01:57:40.666
Ain't got time for that shit

1540
01:57:40.750 --> 01:57:43.583
Before I die. I want heaven

1541
01:57:43.666 --> 01:57:45.208
A hundred percent

1542
01:57:45.291 --> 01:57:48.333
Before I die. I want heaven

1543
01:57:48.416 --> 01:57:50.666
A hundred percent. by the way

1544
01:57:50.750 --> 01:57:52.166
Before I die

1545
01:57:53.291 --> 01:57:55.416
Before dying

1546
01:57:55.500 --> 01:57:56.916
Before I die

1547
01:57:58.125 --> 01:58:00.125
Before dying

1548
01:58:00.208 --> 01:58:01.541
Before I die

1549
01:58:03.041 --> 01:58:04.583
Before dying

1550
01:58:05.375 --> 01:58:06.916
Before I die

1551
01:58:08.041 --> 01:58:10.083
Before dying

1552
01:58:24.541 --> 01:58:25.916
Sky-high

1553
01:58:28.750 --> 01:58:32.416
And crazy. yeah. and crazy

1554
01:58:33.125 --> 01:58:35.458
I'm sick of your games

1555
01:58:35.541 --> 01:58:37.208
But I'm still with you

1556
01:58:37.791 --> 01:58:39.583
I eat diamonds for breakfast

1557
01:58:40.083 --> 01:58:42.000
But I go to bed freezing

1558
01:58:42.083 --> 01:58:43.916
If I run. I won't go far

1559
01:58:44.583 --> 01:58:46.208
So you can make a break for it

1560
01:58:46.791 --> 01:58:48.625
Let's go sky-high

1561
01:58:49.208 --> 01:58:50.791
And fall asleep

1562
01:58:51.541 --> 01:58:52.666
Oh. yeah

1563
01:58:53.875 --> 01:58:55.750
And fall asleep

1564
01:58:55.833 --> 01:58:57.000
Oh. yeah

01:58:58.250 --> 01:59:00.041
And fall asleep

1566
01:59:00.625 --> 01:59:01.666
Oh. yeah

01:59:02.875 --> 01:59:04.625
And fall asleep

1568
01:59:05.083 --> 01:59:06.916
Oh. yeah

1569
01:59:07.958 --> 01:59:09.416
Sky-high

1570
01:59:10.041 --> 01:59:12.041
I'm runnin' outta breath

1571
01:59:12.125 --> 01:59:14.708
I can't breathe

1572
01:59:14.791 --> 01:59:16.208
I'm on the run

1573
01:59:16.791 --> 01:59:19.291
They're tryin' to catch me

1574
01:59:19.375 --> 01:59:21.250
I'm goin' crazy

1575
01:59:21.333 --> 01:59:23.333
Tryin' to find you

1576
01:59:23.916 --> 01:59:25.250
Has anybody seen her?

1577
01:59:25.333 --> 01:59:27.333
They said she went sky-high

1578
01:59:28.458 --> 01:59:29.708
Sky-high

1579
01:59:30.500 --> 01:59:33.000
She went sky-high

1580
01:59:33.083 --> 01:59:35.083
I can't go

1581
01:59:35.166 --> 01:59:36.750
She went sky-high

1582
01:59:37.916 --> 01:59:39.333
And you'd die for me

1583
01:59:42.250 --> 01:59:43.666
Sky-high

1584
01:59:43.750 --> 01:59:46.000
They said she went sky-high

1585
01:59:46.541 --> 01:59:48.000
I look in the mirror

1586
01:59:48.666 --> 01:59:50.291
And I see you

1587
01:59:50.958 --> 01:59:52.583

Suicidal tendencies. no

No food or drink
If you choose that path. you're crazy
