3
00:03:17.414 --> 00:03:18.937
That'll do you. bounty hunter.

4
00:03:43.701 --> 00:03:44.746
Hyah!

5
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.585
Hyah! Hyah!

6
00:04:03.591 --> 00:04:04.766
Hyah! Hyah!

7
00:04:44.632 --> 00:04:46.634
Come on. now! Go!

8
00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:05.305
Whoa.

9
00:05:09.047 --> 00:05:12.442
No more whores! No more whores!

10
00:05:12.486 --> 00:05:16.011
No more whores! No more whores!

11
00:05:16.054 --> 00:05:19.493
No more whores! No more whores!

12
00:05:19.536 --> 00:05:23.061
No more whores! No more whores!

13
00:05:23.105 --> 00:05:26.587
No more whores! No more whores!

14
00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.981
No more whores! No more whores!

15
00:05:30.025 --> 00:05:33.594
No more whores! No more whores!

16
00:05:33.637 --> 00:05:34.899
No more whores!

17
00:05:39.904 --> 00:05:42.429
I'm gonna
get things rolling.

18
00:05:42.472 --> 00:05:46.084
No more whores! No more whores!

19
00:05:46.128 --> 00:05:49.131
No more whores!
No more whores!

20
00:05:49.174 --> 00:05:52.352
No more whores! No more whores!

21
00:05:52.395 --> 00:05:55.790
No more whores!
No more whores!

22
00:05:55.833 --> 00:05:59.576
No more whores! No more whores!

23
00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:05.147
No more whores! No more whores!
No more whores!

24
00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.627
Let's get this thing started.

25
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.106
No more whores!

26
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.804
Three dollars.

27
00:06:09.847 --> 00:06:13.721
No more whores! No more whores!

28
00:06:13.764 --> 00:06:17.377
No more whores!
No more whores!

29
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:21.772
No more whores! No more whores!
No more whores!

30
00:06:21.816 --> 00:06:24.035
Getting a little tense in here.

31
00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:27.082
No more whores! No more whores!

32
00:06:27.125 --> 00:06:28.736
You know. it ain't right.

33
00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:31.652
them folks making all that fuss
over a man getting a poke.

34
00:06:31.695 --> 00:06:36.352
In my experience. that's exactly
what a man and a woman were made for.

35
00:06:40.225 --> 00:06:41.401
Hey. Nora.

36
00:06:44.012 --> 00:06:45.448
Are you gonna play cards?

37
00:06:46.971 --> 00:06:49.234
Or stare at them
the rest of the day?

38
00:06:49.278 --> 00:06:51.976
Hold your dang horses. sheriff.
I'm thinkin'.

39
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.458
No more whores! No more whores!

40
00:06:55.502 --> 00:06:59.506
All right.
I'll see your three.

41
00:07:00.507 --> 00:07:02.465
One. two. three.

42
00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:04.032
And I'll raise you two.

43
00:07:04.075 --> 00:07:05.686
Let's make this a real game.

44
00:07:06.556 --> 00:07:07.731
I'm in.

45
00:07:07.992 --> 00:07:10.473
I can tell you're
something else.

46
00:07:10.517 --> 00:07:12.780
- Get me a drink?
- Sure.

47
00:07:12.823 --> 00:07:14.651
Mm.

48
00:07:14.695 --> 00:07:18.089
No more whores! No more whores!

49
00:07:18.133 --> 00:07:24.574
No more whores! No more whores!
No more whores! No more whores!

50
00:07:24.618 --> 00:07:26.924
Need to take care
of some things for a while.

51
00:07:26.968 --> 00:07:29.449
- You got things here?
- Sure.

52
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.539
But don't be gone too long.
though. you hear?

53
00:07:33.975 --> 00:07:37.239
The way I see it.
poker's like making love.

54
00:07:37.282 --> 00:07:38.632
It's better if you go all in.

55
00:07:39.981 --> 00:07:41.156
Ain't that right. Nora?

56
00:07:41.939 --> 00:07:43.201
That's right.

57
00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.904
Alice? Could we have
another round of whiskey now?

58
00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.609
You know. it's never gonna be
the same as it was.

59
00:07:59.653 --> 00:08:00.567
Mm.

60
00:08:02.133 --> 00:08:05.528
I've lived quite a good life.

61
00:08:05.572 --> 00:08:12.143
I've had some successes
and some not so.

62
00:08:12.187 --> 00:08:14.624
But there is one thing
I've learned.

63
00:08:14.668 --> 00:08:17.148
If you ever get in an argument
with a woman...

64
00:08:18.193 --> 00:08:20.717
There's two methods. Two.

65
00:08:20.761 --> 00:08:23.677
And neither of them work.
I-- I fold.

66
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.462
Don't look like your card
playing's working either.

67
00:08:30.248 --> 00:08:32.729
The way I see it.
if you're gonna get screwed.

68
00:08:32.773 --> 00:08:35.166
might as well be with a woman
and not from cards.

69
00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:37.647
I call.

70
00:08:40.824 --> 00:08:43.000
With all that charm
that you have.

71
00:08:43.044 --> 00:08:45.525
it ain't gonna do you no good
when you see these.

72
00:08:46.787 --> 00:08:49.529
Two pair. kings and threes.

73
00:08:53.445 --> 00:08:55.447
A hearty man ate a toad.

74
00:09:01.018 --> 00:09:02.106
Sheriff!

75
00:09:03.325 --> 00:09:08.373
I just saw one of those hussies
going in my husband's office!

76
00:09:08.417 --> 00:09:10.027
Huh?

77
00:09:10.071 --> 00:09:12.290
You gonna do something
about it or not?

78
00:09:12.334 --> 00:09:13.553
Yes. ma'am.

79
00:09:17.992 --> 00:09:19.167
Duty calls.

80
00:09:20.647 --> 00:09:21.648
Mm.

81
00:09:23.432 --> 00:09:24.607
Yes. ma'am.

82
00:09:34.922 --> 00:09:38.012
She's in here. sheriff.
I know she is!

83
00:09:38.055 --> 00:09:41.015
I saw her come in
with my own eyes!

84
00:09:41.058 --> 00:09:43.887
If you're in here.
Nora. come on out.

85
00:09:49.545 --> 00:09:50.894
Oh. my God.

86
00:09:53.375 --> 00:09:55.551
Good God almighty.

87
00:09:55.595 --> 00:09:58.206
Oh!

88
00:10:00.338 --> 00:10:01.731
You best get out of here.

89
00:10:10.218 --> 00:10:12.960
Mayor. put your pants on.

90
00:10:13.003 --> 00:10:17.442
I'm gonna need some help
hefting up your wife. She ain't exactly underfed.

91
00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:19.880
Give me a hand.

92
00:10:30.238 --> 00:10:34.111
The boys and I
made a collection last night.

93
00:10:35.156 --> 00:10:36.418
Bought this for ya.

94
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.465
That Grimes gang
is terrorizing the countryside

95
00:10:40.509 --> 00:10:44.513
and no telling
what's gonna happen if. uh. if you run into them.

96
00:10:44.556 --> 00:10:46.167
But if you run into trouble.

97
00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:49.736
trouble tends to think twice
before rearing its head

98
00:10:49.779 --> 00:10:52.216
and finds a loaded rifle
pointing at him.

99
00:10:53.391 --> 00:10:54.958
So it's yours and it is loaded.

100
00:10:55.002 --> 00:10:57.482
Much obliged.
Thank you. sheriff.

101
00:10:57.526 --> 00:11:00.398
Those that sell their bodies
sell their souls!

102
00:11:00.442 --> 00:11:02.662
Harlots!

103
00:11:02.705 --> 00:11:04.794
We don't need
your kind around here.

104
00:11:04.838 --> 00:11:07.841
Ma'am. they're leaving.
they're getting ready to go.

105
00:11:07.884 --> 00:11:10.365
Go on back. ladies.
Don't get nasty.

106
00:11:10.408 --> 00:11:12.367
A plague has been lifted
from our town.

107
00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:14.021
Hallelujah. praise the Lord!

108
00:11:14.064 --> 00:11:16.588
If we're all so fired wicked.
what's that make their husbands?

109
00:11:16.632 --> 00:11:19.896
I'll bet that makes them
our best customers on a Saturday night.

110
00:11:23.334 --> 00:11:25.554
Aw. damn.

111
00:11:25.597 --> 00:11:27.512
Get up. get these
out of here. deputy.

112
00:11:27.556 --> 00:11:28.644
Yes. sheriff.

113
00:11:29.514 --> 00:11:33.214
Damn. Anyone that throws
something at me again.

114
00:11:33.257 --> 00:11:36.565
they're gonna end in jail.
or get the back of my hand!

115
00:11:37.522 --> 00:11:38.741
Damned old biddies.

116
00:11:40.656 --> 00:11:42.005
Personally. girls...

117
00:11:42.789 --> 00:11:43.790
Um...

118
00:11:45.313 --> 00:11:48.055
I like you. As a matter of fact.
I like both of you.

119
00:11:48.098 --> 00:11:51.058
Yeah! Especially
on a Saturday night when you like to. you know.

120
00:11:51.101 --> 00:11:53.538
- unlace those corsets and...
- Easy. Easy. Nora. Nora.

121
00:11:53.582 --> 00:11:55.976
Let's not be saying
something out of school.

122
00:11:58.326 --> 00:11:59.414
You girls be careful.

123
00:12:00.371 --> 00:12:01.590
Thanks. sheriff.

124
00:12:06.769 --> 00:12:10.338
Sorry. Alice. I never meant
for us to get the boot.

125
00:12:11.643 --> 00:12:12.688
It's all right.

126
00:12:13.689 --> 00:12:15.996
I was fixing to leave
this place anyway.

127
00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:19.695
Maybe open up a business.

128
00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:22.785
You know. a restaurant.
or change my life around or something.

129
00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:25.875
Hey. Nora. leaving town?

130
00:12:26.876 --> 00:12:30.184
Yeah. it's about time we got out
of this shithole of a town.

131
00:12:30.227 --> 00:12:33.622
Well. I'll need to know
where you're going and soon.

132
00:12:33.665 --> 00:12:38.148
'Cause I can't wait for it.
Nora. And you. Alice.

133
00:12:38.192 --> 00:12:40.890
Cowboys are so easy.

134
00:12:40.934 --> 00:12:45.242
Yeah. Yes. that's what got us
into this predicament. if I recall.

135
00:12:46.896 --> 00:12:48.115
Come on. Jolene.

136
00:13:05.045 --> 00:13:06.263
Bye. boys.

137
00:13:07.395 --> 00:13:09.005
Sad to see 'em go. sheriff?

138
00:13:12.182 --> 00:13:14.706
Not as sad as I'm gonna be
Saturday night.

139
00:13:16.839 --> 00:13:21.191
We'll miss you! I'll never win
a card game again.

140
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.078
So...

141
00:13:38.992 --> 00:13:41.037
have you heard
from what's-his-face?

142
00:13:41.081 --> 00:13:43.605
- Not yet.
- Mm-hmm.

143
00:13:43.648 --> 00:13:44.693
Alice.

144
00:13:46.695 --> 00:13:47.696
Oh!

145
00:13:50.003 --> 00:13:53.310
Oh!

146
00:13:53.354 --> 00:13:54.616
I knew you'd come.

147
00:13:54.659 --> 00:13:56.052
Didn't think I was gonna
let you leave town

148
00:13:56.096 --> 00:13:57.619
without telling me
goodbye. did you?

149
00:13:57.662 --> 00:13:59.186
Oh. it don't have to be goodbye.

150
00:13:59.229 --> 00:14:00.883
not as long as you keep
holding me tight

151
00:14:00.927 --> 00:14:02.580
and promise never to let me go.

152
00:14:03.277 --> 00:14:04.974
How's your wife. Orin?

153
00:14:06.715 --> 00:14:08.021
- What--
- She's fine.

154
00:14:09.718 --> 00:14:11.720
Wait. you--
you haven't left her yet?

155
00:14:12.677 --> 00:14:15.506
Alice. when the time is right.

156
00:14:16.464 --> 00:14:17.552
I will. I promise.

157
00:14:19.815 --> 00:14:21.861
When's that gonna be. Orin?

158
00:14:23.166 --> 00:14:25.342
Soon. real soon.

159
00:14:25.386 --> 00:14:26.778
I promise.

160
00:14:26.822 --> 00:14:30.478
When you get somewhere.
settled. write me. please.

161
00:14:30.521 --> 00:14:33.698
I'll come for ya. I promise.
I swear on a stack of Bibles. I will.

162
00:14:34.699 --> 00:14:36.788
- Please.
- If you say so. Orin.

163
00:14:42.272 --> 00:14:43.795
You really believed

164
00:14:43.839 --> 00:14:47.190
he was gonna come
for you. didn't you? Hah.

165
00:14:47.234 --> 00:14:50.324
That man's had a hook in you
ever since you came to this town.

166
00:14:50.367 --> 00:14:52.804
He just reels you in
whenever he wants a bite.

167
00:14:52.848 --> 00:14:54.371
You can see that now.
can't you?

168
00:14:54.415 --> 00:14:56.156
He always treated me
like a lady.

169
00:14:56.199 --> 00:14:58.332
Hah! Wake up. honey.

170
00:14:58.375 --> 00:15:00.856
Orin's like any other fella.
all talk.

171
00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.337
Ain't no man ever kept
his word to a whore.

172
00:15:10.518 --> 00:15:11.562
Hey. Orin!

173
00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.435
Kiss my ass!

174
00:17:02.934 --> 00:17:06.460
<i>♪ Don't you remember
sweet Betsy from Pike ♪</i>

175
00:17:06.503 --> 00:17:10.768
<i>♪ Who crossed the wide prairie
with her lover Ike ♪</i>

- Do you think he's...
- Nah. We'd smell him if he was.

189
00:17:51.722 --> 00:17:54.029
We ought to help him out.
It'd be the Christian thing to do.

190
00:17:54.986 --> 00:17:56.597
Since when did you
get religious?

191
00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.340
Ah-- Since we got kicked
out of town.

192
00:18:00.383 --> 00:18:04.170
I mean. maybe it's the good
Lord's way of saying that it's time for a change.

193
00:18:04.213 --> 00:18:06.737
What has that got to do
with helping this fella?

194
00:18:06.781 --> 00:18:08.565
Love thy neighbor?

195
00:18:08.609 --> 00:18:10.698
That's what got us
kicked out of town in the first place.

196
00:18:11.699 --> 00:18:15.268
Well. you sure
didn't make things easy messing around with the mayor.

197
00:18:20.447 --> 00:18:21.361
Hey.

198
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:24.233
You got your lady's companion?

199
00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:27.149
Always do.

200
00:18:30.892 --> 00:18:31.849
Oh...

201
00:18:37.507 --> 00:18:38.465
Hey.

202
00:18:39.553 --> 00:18:42.033
Hey. mister. You all right?

203
00:18:43.557 --> 00:18:46.299
You think he'd be out here
in the middle of nowhere left for dead if he was?

204
00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:50.216
If you don't button your lip.
you'll be right here on the ground with him. Savvy?

205
00:18:50.259 --> 00:18:52.174
So much for love thy neighbor.

206
00:18:53.915 --> 00:18:55.046
Man.

207
00:18:56.483 --> 00:18:59.312
He has got more holes in him
than a billiard table.

208
00:19:00.617 --> 00:19:01.792
He breathing?

209
00:19:09.278 --> 00:19:11.150
- Help me out here.
- Hey.

210
00:19:14.718 --> 00:19:16.024
You still wanna help him?

211
00:19:17.112 --> 00:19:20.246
We can't condemn a man
without hearing his side of things first.

212
00:19:20.289 --> 00:19:21.464
But--

213
00:19:21.508 --> 00:19:23.988
Best to hold on to that.
just in case.

214
00:19:24.032 --> 00:19:26.121
He ain't no Sunday preacher.

215
00:19:27.078 --> 00:19:28.689
Not with six notches in his gun.

216
00:19:30.386 --> 00:19:33.041
We can put him on your horse.
you can ride double with me.

217
00:19:33.084 --> 00:19:36.610
I bought Old Bob for me.
not what's-his-nuts here.

218
00:19:36.653 --> 00:19:38.525
Riding double's
never bothered you before.

219
00:19:38.568 --> 00:19:41.615
That was different.
I was getting paid.

220
00:19:41.658 --> 00:19:43.138
Well. I'll owe ya.

221
00:19:45.532 --> 00:19:48.404
Jolene's already packing
too much weight as it is.

222
00:19:50.972 --> 00:19:52.321
You sure about this?

223
00:19:52.365 --> 00:19:55.194
Yes. now quit letting go of him.

224
00:19:55.237 --> 00:19:56.456
- Help me.
- Oh--

225
00:19:57.892 --> 00:20:00.547
You just let one man
drop you like a baked potato fresh from the oven.

226
00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:02.723
and now you wanna start
taking up with another.

227
00:20:02.766 --> 00:20:04.333
Would you come on?

228
00:20:04.377 --> 00:20:06.117
It is hot enough
to pop corn out here

229
00:20:06.161 --> 00:20:07.641
and we need to find some shade.

230
00:20:07.684 --> 00:20:08.903
Come on.

231
00:20:08.946 --> 00:20:11.514
There...

232
00:20:26.355 --> 00:20:29.097
- How's he looking?
- Well...

233
00:20:30.794 --> 00:20:33.057
being dragged the way he was.

234
00:20:33.101 --> 00:20:34.972
dirt plugged the hole.

235
00:20:35.973 --> 00:20:37.888
There's a slug in there
that needs to come out.

236
00:20:39.629 --> 00:20:42.197
The other shot looks like
it went clean through.

237
00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:45.461
Don't look like
no vitals was hit.

238
00:20:47.637 --> 00:20:49.813
Seeing as how you got
his pants off and all.

239
00:20:51.119 --> 00:20:52.686
how's he look down yonder?

240
00:20:53.687 --> 00:20:56.255
And don't tell me
you didn't sneak a peek 'cause I know you did.

241
00:20:58.605 --> 00:21:00.128
Well?

242
00:21:00.171 --> 00:21:01.999
Why are you so interested
all of a sudden?

243
00:21:02.043 --> 00:21:03.653
Professional curiosity.

244
00:21:04.654 --> 00:21:08.571
What caliber
we talking here? .22? .38?

245
00:21:08.615 --> 00:21:10.660
It's a .44.

246
00:21:13.097 --> 00:21:14.360
Any notches on it?

247
00:21:15.491 --> 00:21:18.059
In case you forgot.
we are trying to get out of that line of business.

248
00:21:18.102 --> 00:21:20.670
You are. I like what I do.

249
00:21:20.714 --> 00:21:24.500
Besides. proper ladies get poked
by fellas too. don't they?

250
00:21:24.544 --> 00:21:28.025
Sure they do.
but if my scheme pans out.

251
00:21:28.069 --> 00:21:31.290
you'll only have to bed down
with the ones you want to.

252
00:21:31.333 --> 00:21:35.990
No more toothless gummers
or fat guys or saddle trash.

253
00:21:36.033 --> 00:21:38.297
Just gentlemen of your choosin'.

254
00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.734
I mean. "lady" always
had more of a ring to it

255
00:21:40.777 --> 00:21:42.518
than "lewd woman."
don't you think?

256
00:21:42.562 --> 00:21:44.128
You and rings.

257
00:21:44.172 --> 00:21:46.653
Ever since I known you.
you been hung up on them.

258
00:21:46.696 --> 00:21:49.569
The brass ring. Wedding ring.

259
00:21:49.612 --> 00:21:51.571
What's it gonna be next.
the three-ring circus?

260
00:21:54.182 --> 00:21:57.664
Go fetch me that skinning knife
out of Old Bob's saddle bag. will you?

261
00:21:57.707 --> 00:21:59.187
And. uh...

262
00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:02.364
Oh. and a flask of whiskey
and a tin cup.

263
00:22:14.637 --> 00:22:16.030
Where'd you learn doctorin'?

264
00:22:16.987 --> 00:22:18.119
I didn't.

265
00:22:19.599 --> 00:22:20.600
Here goes nothing.

266
00:22:22.384 --> 00:22:23.994
Ah!

267
00:22:24.038 --> 00:22:25.605
Mister! Mister!

268
00:22:25.648 --> 00:22:27.824
You have got a sizable
hunk of lead in you

269
00:22:27.868 --> 00:22:29.478
that I was about to take out.

270
00:22:29.522 --> 00:22:32.089
but if you wanna keep it.
I can leave it be.

271
00:22:35.223 --> 00:22:36.920
Whiskey. please.

272
00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:40.968
Thank you.

273
00:22:45.886 --> 00:22:48.671
Ohh...

274
00:22:48.715 --> 00:22:49.933
All right.

275
00:22:53.154 --> 00:22:55.112
All right.
let's do it. Go ahead.

276
00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:58.202
Go ahead. Come on.

277
00:22:58.246 --> 00:23:00.944
Let's see...

278
00:23:00.988 --> 00:23:03.425
What are you doing? Huh?
Start with the back.

279
00:23:03.469 --> 00:23:06.776
Don't need any more holes
being put in me.

280
00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:09.126
Slow and steady
until you hit something solid.

281
00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:10.476
- That'll be the bullet.
- All right.

282
00:23:16.873 --> 00:23:19.093
Ohh.

283
00:23:19.136 --> 00:23:21.661
- I got it!
- You're awful tender for a man

284
00:23:21.704 --> 00:23:24.098
who looks like he spends
a lot of time in rough country.

285
00:23:28.232 --> 00:23:29.712
There you are. mister.

286
00:23:29.756 --> 00:23:31.845
Hah.

287
00:23:32.933 --> 00:23:36.719
You know. deep down.
men ain't nothing but big babies.

288
00:23:36.763 --> 00:23:39.113
I mean. all that fuss
for just one little old bullet?

289
00:23:40.723 --> 00:23:42.159
Best get a fire going.

290
00:24:03.572 --> 00:24:08.316
Well. I must say I am obliged
for the food and the doctorin'.

291
00:24:09.448 --> 00:24:12.451
You was
in a pretty rough way when we found you. mister...

292
00:24:12.494 --> 00:24:14.757
Uh. Gallup. Eldon Gallup.

293
00:24:17.673 --> 00:24:21.764
This place ain't fit
for belly crawlers and buzzards. let alone people.

294
00:24:21.808 --> 00:24:23.505
What are you doing
out here anyway?

295
00:24:25.942 --> 00:24:29.293
Suppose I could ask you
the same question. huh? Hm?

296
00:24:31.382 --> 00:24:33.123
What are ya. a hired gun?

297
00:24:34.516 --> 00:24:36.518
We saw them notches
on your pistol.

298
00:24:36.562 --> 00:24:37.563
You did?

299
00:24:41.305 --> 00:24:43.090
Yes. I. uh...

300
00:24:43.133 --> 00:24:45.222
I do make a living with my gun.

301
00:24:46.833 --> 00:24:48.530
But I ain't never been
hired out.

302
00:24:49.575 --> 00:24:50.880
Speaking of which.

303
00:24:52.099 --> 00:24:53.448
where the hell's my gun?

304
00:24:54.797 --> 00:24:55.842
Hm?

305
00:25:08.855 --> 00:25:10.030
You a bounty hunter?

306
00:25:11.379 --> 00:25:12.946
Why don't you check my pocket?

307
00:25:13.947 --> 00:25:15.078
If you dare.

308
00:25:25.393 --> 00:25:26.481
This. uh...

309
00:25:27.438 --> 00:25:29.266
"Gila Grimes..."

310
00:25:30.311 --> 00:25:31.834
Looks like quite a peach.

311
00:25:33.357 --> 00:25:35.882
What'd he do to warrant
a reward for 2.000 dollars?

312
00:25:36.883 --> 00:25:38.841
Oh. wow. Hmm... Tsk.

313
00:25:39.842 --> 00:25:42.236
Nothing fit to mention
in front of a lady.

314
00:25:42.279 --> 00:25:44.499
He the one that shot you?

315
00:25:46.283 --> 00:25:51.288
Well. I reckon so.
though I imagine that was a bit hard to say.

316
00:25:51.332 --> 00:25:52.942
Shot me in the back.
Miss. uh...

317
00:25:54.683 --> 00:25:56.642
Oh. I'm Alice.

318
00:25:56.685 --> 00:25:58.252
This here's Nora.

319
00:25:58.295 --> 00:26:00.471
Nora. Beautiful.

320
00:26:00.515 --> 00:26:02.473
Looks like he got
quite a jump on you.

321
00:26:03.953 --> 00:26:05.781
Who was stalking who. huh?

322
00:26:05.825 --> 00:26:07.304
I underestimated him.

323
00:26:08.436 --> 00:26:09.742
And it damn near got me killed.

324
00:26:09.785 --> 00:26:11.178
but it's a mistake
I won't make twice.

325
00:26:11.221 --> 00:26:13.310
that's for sure. Uh...

326
00:26:14.355 --> 00:26:16.183
I know for a fact
he is holed up

327
00:26:16.226 --> 00:26:19.839
in this God-forsaken
hellhole somewhere.

328
00:26:22.058 --> 00:26:23.930
I never met a man hunter before.

329
00:26:25.235 --> 00:26:26.933
You know. Mr. Gallup.

330
00:26:28.021 --> 00:26:30.763
you could say
we're in a related line of work.

331
00:26:32.721 --> 00:26:35.376
Though the men
are usually hunting after us.

332
00:26:38.422 --> 00:26:39.380
Oh. no.

333
00:26:40.424 --> 00:26:43.602
Just my luck. Do not tell me
y'all are whores.

334
00:26:44.603 --> 00:26:46.648
- Sportin' gals.
- Soiled doves.

335
00:26:46.692 --> 00:26:48.215
High desert hussies.

336
00:26:48.258 --> 00:26:50.043
and about a dozen
other crude names... - Whores.

337
00:26:50.086 --> 00:26:53.307
...you could call two women
working in the world's oldest profession.

338
00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:56.049
We were kicked out of town
by the women's decency league.

339
00:26:56.092 --> 00:26:58.965
Whose beds do you think
their husbands' boots were under?

340
00:26:59.008 --> 00:27:01.054
Wasn't their wives.
I'll tell you that much.

341
00:27:01.881 --> 00:27:05.362
Wow. You must be so proud.

342
00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:10.324
Any worker worth their wages
takes pride in what they do.

343
00:27:11.847 --> 00:27:13.501
We're headed up
to Virginia City.

344
00:27:13.544 --> 00:27:15.982
We're looking for a higher
and better road to follow.

345
00:27:16.939 --> 00:27:19.463
Mm. yeah. well. I mean.
I bet you're awful saddle sore

346
00:27:19.507 --> 00:27:21.770
after a profession like that.

347
00:27:21.814 --> 00:27:23.642
We wanna open up a restaurant.

348
00:27:23.685 --> 00:27:25.165
We're gonna call it
the Horny Toad.

349
00:27:25.208 --> 00:27:26.775
That's right. The Horny Toad.

350
00:27:26.819 --> 00:27:28.603
Very catchy name.

351
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:31.562
There is a silver strike
up there

352
00:27:31.606 --> 00:27:33.782
and all them miners
is gonna need a place to eat.

353
00:27:33.826 --> 00:27:36.829
You know what they'll also need?
A place to poke!

354
00:27:36.872 --> 00:27:40.397
Oh. just stick with
what you're good at. My mom always did.

355
00:27:41.834 --> 00:27:43.836
Those days are over for me.

356
00:27:43.879 --> 00:27:47.666
I wanna open up
a respectable place for respectable people.

357
00:27:47.709 --> 00:27:51.365
Respect. though.
is hard to come by.

358
00:27:54.324 --> 00:27:56.326
Well. I like just being me.

359
00:27:57.806 --> 00:27:59.155
Same here.

360
00:27:59.199 --> 00:28:02.202
Oh. shit. that hurt.
I'm gonna call it a night.

361
00:28:02.245 --> 00:28:03.551
I've been shot at.

362
00:28:05.205 --> 00:28:10.297
been carved up by some whore
playing pretend doctor. just...

363
00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:13.779
it's too much. It's too much.

364
00:28:15.781 --> 00:28:19.175
You know. I have never met
a man that spent so much time on his back.

365
00:28:19.219 --> 00:28:23.136
- Yeah. Maybe he's a whore too.
- Damn right I am.

366
00:28:24.354 --> 00:28:25.704
Best in the business.

367
00:28:32.188 --> 00:28:33.537
- ...to get like this.
- No. we don't.

368
00:28:33.581 --> 00:28:35.322
- It's just gonna be a minute...
- Okay.

369
00:28:35.365 --> 00:28:38.020
What are you
two sisters in sin whispering about. huh?

370
00:28:38.064 --> 00:28:39.413
Stick your foot down.

371
00:28:39.456 --> 00:28:41.850
We just been discussing
your predicament.

372
00:28:45.114 --> 00:28:47.769
This here Grimes fella.

373
00:28:47.813 --> 00:28:49.945
You ain't in no shape
to take him on by yourself.

374
00:28:50.554 --> 00:28:55.777
And what the hell do you two
even know about chasing a man like Grimes?

375
00:28:56.996 --> 00:28:58.998
Oh. we've had
our fair share of bad men.

376
00:29:01.827 --> 00:29:03.611
Wow. that's gratitude for ya.

377
00:29:03.654 --> 00:29:06.832
Save a man's life
and he starts laughing and calling you names.

378
00:29:07.876 --> 00:29:08.834
Ow.

379
00:29:11.967 --> 00:29:12.968
We'll help you.

380
00:29:13.926 --> 00:29:15.231
For half the bounty.

381
00:29:15.275 --> 00:29:16.580
Half?

382
00:29:18.017 --> 00:29:19.758
Half. Half?

383
00:29:19.801 --> 00:29:22.761
If I could stand up.
I would fall down laughing.

384
00:29:22.804 --> 00:29:25.546
Half. I never heard
such a thing. Crazy.

385
00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:28.418
Without us. you'll probably
die of sunstroke.

386
00:29:28.462 --> 00:29:31.639
- Snake bite. Starve.
- Gangrene. Die of thirst.

387
00:29:31.682 --> 00:29:34.120
Wow. glad you guys
are all so concerned about me.

388
00:29:34.163 --> 00:29:36.513
- Well. thank you. Thank you.
- Oh. mind us. honey.

389
00:29:36.557 --> 00:29:38.559
- You need us.
- I need you?

390
00:29:38.602 --> 00:29:40.169
I need you like I need syphilis.

391
00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:45.435
You need our stock.
our supply and our help.

392
00:29:46.523 --> 00:29:49.570
'Cause without 'em.
you're buzzard bait and you know it.

393
00:29:49.613 --> 00:29:50.876
What'll it be. Eldon?

394
00:29:52.181 --> 00:29:54.401
Fine. Stay here
and die if you like.

395
00:29:54.444 --> 00:29:56.316
It ain't no skin off our nose.

396
00:29:59.623 --> 00:30:01.277
Ugh! Damn it.

397
00:30:01.321 --> 00:30:03.889
Ah. is that a yes?

398
00:30:03.932 --> 00:30:07.849
Well. not like I have
much of a choice. Y'all had me over a barrel.

399
00:30:07.893 --> 00:30:10.896
It was a horse.
if you don't remember.

400
00:30:12.027 --> 00:30:13.028
I don't.

401
00:30:14.073 --> 00:30:16.466
Well.
would you look at that?

402
00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:19.121
I guess you needed us
more than you realized.

403
00:30:21.645 --> 00:30:23.212
You actually gonna ride
in that dress?

404
00:30:24.213 --> 00:30:26.433
Don't you worry about my ridin'.

405
00:30:26.476 --> 00:30:28.087
I ride just fine.

406
00:30:29.479 --> 00:30:33.266
Ask any man
from Socorro to Santa Fe. They'll tell you.

407
00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:49.848
Well. well. well.

408
00:30:49.891 --> 00:30:51.893
A couple of whores in a tizzy.

409
00:30:55.941 --> 00:30:57.681
I thought I killed you.

410
00:31:06.168 --> 00:31:08.605
You're not the only one
taking risks out here. you know.

411
00:31:09.606 --> 00:31:11.565
We don't even know
if we can trust you.

412
00:31:12.958 --> 00:31:16.309
Bit of free advice.
Don't trust no one but yourself.

413
00:31:16.352 --> 00:31:18.267
Less likely to be let down.

414
00:31:18.311 --> 00:31:21.009
This is a damn fool's errand.
is what it is.

415
00:31:21.053 --> 00:31:23.490
What the hell do you two know
about chasing hard men. anyway?

416
00:31:25.709 --> 00:31:28.930
Oh. giggle all you want.
that's fine.

417
00:31:28.974 --> 00:31:30.758
Ain't gonna be
a cathouse parlor game.

418
00:31:30.801 --> 00:31:34.066
Grimes. Last time we tangled.
he damn near killed me.

419
00:31:34.109 --> 00:31:36.503
He ain't gonna
bat an eye rubbing out the likes of you two.

420
00:31:37.547 --> 00:31:40.942
Go on. see how much
laughing you do when that lead starts flying.

421
00:31:41.856 --> 00:31:44.641
- Yeah.
- What's wrong there. Mr. Gallup?

422
00:31:44.685 --> 00:31:46.687
Desert got you all hot
and bothered?

423
00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:48.602
Nope. just you.

424
00:32:06.315 --> 00:32:08.491
Do you know where we're going?

425
00:32:08.535 --> 00:32:10.189
Hell in a handbasket.

426
00:32:20.068 --> 00:32:22.114
You don't much
like us now. do you?

427
00:32:22.157 --> 00:32:25.508
- Leave him be. Nora.
- I'm just trying to make conversation.

428
00:32:25.552 --> 00:32:28.250
Going into business
with someone's like going to bed with them.

429
00:32:28.294 --> 00:32:29.991
The more you know about them.
the easier it'll be

430
00:32:30.035 --> 00:32:32.298
when things get rough
and tumble.

431
00:32:37.825 --> 00:32:38.957
Nora. is it?

432
00:32:39.958 --> 00:32:42.003
Ain't gotta worry about
catching me in your bed.

433
00:32:43.004 --> 00:32:45.180
You ain't exactly
my kind of woman.

434
00:32:45.224 --> 00:32:48.009
Besides. I never pay for it.
Never will.

435
00:32:48.053 --> 00:32:50.142
You couldn't afford me anyway.

436
00:32:50.185 --> 00:32:52.927
You got that right.
I ain't got but ten cents to my name.

437
00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:55.321
You got something
against whores?

438
00:32:55.974 --> 00:32:57.845
Mm. not until
I met one. I didn't.

439
00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:03.546
I was just a-- a young buck.
ventured into a house of ill repute.

440
00:33:05.635 --> 00:33:08.247
Went upstairs
with this tender young thing.

441
00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:09.552
Then what?

442
00:33:09.639 --> 00:33:12.164
Well. she. uh. rolled me
right down to my socks.

443
00:33:13.165 --> 00:33:14.862
You can't judge
a whole profession

444
00:33:14.905 --> 00:33:17.256
based on what
one greedy whore did.

445
00:33:17.996 --> 00:33:21.173
Greedy and whore now them two
words they go together just fine. don't they?

446
00:33:21.216 --> 00:33:22.957
Kinda like bounty hunter
and scum.

447
00:33:23.001 --> 00:33:25.220
You sound a bit soured
on women.

448
00:33:25.264 --> 00:33:27.266
Well. believe it or not.

449
00:33:28.267 --> 00:33:32.097
under all the dirt.
sand and stubble.

450
00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:35.230
there's a handsome face
that has...

451
00:33:35.274 --> 00:33:37.798
has caught the fancy
of many a young lady. -

452
00:33:37.841 --> 00:33:40.322
Oh. too bad
ain't none of them here right now.

453
00:33:40.366 --> 00:33:43.195
I never met a man as cocky
and full of himself as you.

454
00:33:43.238 --> 00:33:45.110
- Shh. shh. shh.
- Don't hush me.

455
00:33:45.153 --> 00:33:46.589
I can speak if I want to.

456
00:33:46.633 --> 00:33:48.983
You're not the boss
of us and-- -

457
00:33:55.729 --> 00:33:58.036
All right. easy. love.
All right. all right.

458
00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:21.059
Whoa. Well. I'm gonna go ahead
and venture a guess and say not so good.

459
00:34:21.102 --> 00:34:22.973
I reckon you're right.

460
00:34:23.017 --> 00:34:25.193
Hold on. Let me jump down here.

461
00:34:26.064 --> 00:34:27.195
I got you.

462
00:34:28.457 --> 00:34:30.329
Wow.

463
00:34:32.896 --> 00:34:34.420
This oughta do the trick.

464
00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:38.119
- There we go.
- Jesus!

465
00:34:46.910 --> 00:34:48.999
Well. this canteen's bone-dry.

466
00:34:56.006 --> 00:35:00.315
Well. we should be
at the water hole by tomorrow sundown. All right?

467
00:35:00.359 --> 00:35:01.708
Well. that doesn't do me
any good.

468
00:35:01.751 --> 00:35:03.840
I'm thirsty right now.

469
00:35:03.884 --> 00:35:06.887
Well. you can do
a little rain dance.

470
00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:08.932
Huh? See how far that gets you.

471
00:35:08.976 --> 00:35:10.847
What about Grimes?

472
00:35:10.891 --> 00:35:14.024
Ain't he have to be
coming after us any minute now down that trail?

473
00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:19.378
No. His-- his horse took
one hell of a chili-wanger.

474
00:35:19.421 --> 00:35:21.380
Snake hole.

475
00:35:21.423 --> 00:35:25.123
No. he ain't going anywhere
any time soon. Except by foot maybe.

476
00:35:25.166 --> 00:35:26.733
We'll settle with him later.

477
00:35:27.734 --> 00:35:30.476
Can you. um. can you help me up?

478
00:35:33.957 --> 00:35:36.656
- You sure you're fit to ride?
- No.

479
00:35:37.874 --> 00:35:41.095
But that one.
she's thirsty right now. so we don't got a choice.

480
00:35:46.448 --> 00:35:48.363
Alice. we're riding
with a damn child.

481
00:35:49.886 --> 00:35:51.149
Come on. here you go.

482
00:35:53.063 --> 00:35:55.414
Okay. let's go. Whoa.

483
00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:18.480
I won't be needing
this damn thing anymore.

484
00:36:33.843 --> 00:36:35.802
Is there a reason we're stopping

485
00:36:35.845 --> 00:36:37.673
or do you just wanna
admire the dirt?

486
00:36:37.717 --> 00:36:40.372
Well. Alice was right.

487
00:36:40.415 --> 00:36:43.505
Tsk. If y'all are gonna help me
hunt down Grimes.

488
00:36:46.334 --> 00:36:48.249
you need to learn how.
all right?

489
00:36:48.293 --> 00:36:51.121
It is a two-step process.

490
00:36:51.165 --> 00:36:53.776
Shootin'. survivin'.

491
00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:56.518
I thought you said
that you could bring him back dead or alive.

492
00:36:57.171 --> 00:36:59.042
Dead's just easier.

493
00:36:59.086 --> 00:37:01.262
Let's see what you got.

494
00:37:01.306 --> 00:37:03.917
Let's see if you can hit
that cactus down yonder.

495
00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:05.179
- Okay.
- All right?

496
00:37:13.622 --> 00:37:18.627
Uh-huh. Wow. All right.
let's just-- plenty of that.

497
00:37:18.671 --> 00:37:19.759
Next!

498
00:37:35.514 --> 00:37:37.559
She kicked your ass.

499
00:37:37.603 --> 00:37:39.909
Where'd you learn
to shoot like that?

500
00:37:39.953 --> 00:37:42.477
Most fathers give
their little girls pretty little things.

501
00:37:42.521 --> 00:37:43.913
but not my daddy.

502
00:37:43.957 --> 00:37:46.438
When I turned 13.
he got me my first Henry rifle

503
00:37:46.481 --> 00:37:50.877
to help fill the stew pot
with coons. turkeys. possums.

504
00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.401
You name it.
I plucked 'em and plugged 'em.

505
00:37:53.445 --> 00:37:55.664
You ever draw down
on a man. though?

506
00:37:55.708 --> 00:37:56.752
- No.
- Pulled the trigger?

507
00:37:58.580 --> 00:37:59.625
No.

508
00:38:00.669 --> 00:38:02.105
Might just get your chance.

509
00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:08.764
Here we go.
Let's try this again.

510
00:38:10.026 --> 00:38:13.334
All right. All right.
Let's see what you got.

511
00:38:16.685 --> 00:38:18.208
All right.
now slow down a little bit.

512
00:38:18.252 --> 00:38:19.906
- I know.
- Just--

513
00:38:19.949 --> 00:38:23.866
You need to put
two hands up there. okay. keep both eyes open.

514
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:25.651
Breathe. Easy.

515
00:38:27.827 --> 00:38:31.700
Uh-huh. All right. well.
let's try spreading the legs a little bit.

516
00:38:31.744 --> 00:38:34.964
Like you got a man
in between there. Keep your eyes on it.

517
00:38:35.008 --> 00:38:36.096
Mm-hmm.

518
00:38:37.924 --> 00:38:40.622
All right. well.

519
00:38:40.666 --> 00:38:42.015
that wasn't
a full-on hit. though.

520
00:38:42.058 --> 00:38:43.756
- but it was pretty close!
- Oh!

521
00:38:47.455 --> 00:38:49.065
Maybe just. uh...

522
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:51.285
Well. maybe you might've
got a ricochet.

523
00:38:52.242 --> 00:38:54.506
Huh. Oh. well.

524
00:38:55.898 --> 00:38:57.639
- Huh?
- Jesus!

525
00:39:00.163 --> 00:39:02.296
"I ain't afraid to love a man.

526
00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:04.472
I ain't afraid
to kill him neither."

527
00:39:04.516 --> 00:39:06.300
Annie Oakley said that.

528
00:39:06.344 --> 00:39:10.826
I don't know who that is.
but I'd rather her here than you.

529
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:12.219
Give me that damn thing.

530
00:39:13.873 --> 00:39:17.180
- Where is Alice?
- In the bushes. What do you think?

531
00:39:18.138 --> 00:39:19.574
I think it's time to go.

532
00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.302
Hey.

533
00:39:58.004 --> 00:39:59.222
Want coffee?

534
00:40:00.441 --> 00:40:01.486
You really want some?

535
00:40:02.443 --> 00:40:05.228
Get it yourself.
I ain't at your beck and call. am I?

536
00:40:19.808 --> 00:40:21.462
Well. boss...

537
00:40:21.506 --> 00:40:23.290
I would offer you some coffee.

538
00:40:23.333 --> 00:40:26.424
but you done went and shot
the shit out of the pot.

539
00:40:26.467 --> 00:40:31.211
I thought you'd have somethin
with a bit more bite in it. you old rattler.

540
00:40:31.254 --> 00:40:32.952
Well. for you.

541
00:40:37.522 --> 00:40:38.523
Yeah.

542
00:40:39.828 --> 00:40:42.483
Shot the
coffee pot. -

543
00:40:43.441 --> 00:40:47.183
You know. boss.
you got any other urges that need to be satisfied.

544
00:40:49.795 --> 00:40:50.796
Figures.

545
00:40:51.884 --> 00:40:52.885
Coochy coo!

546
00:40:54.234 --> 00:40:56.671
Young and tender.
just like you like 'em.

547
00:40:56.715 --> 00:40:59.413
You better watch that one. bud.

548
00:40:59.457 --> 00:41:01.633
She might bite off
more than you reckon.

549
00:41:04.374 --> 00:41:07.465
Besides. I like pain
before pleasure.

550
00:41:12.774 --> 00:41:14.820
I have a bounty hunter
that's been dogging me.

551
00:41:16.386 --> 00:41:18.650
You planning on turning
the tables on him. boss?

552
00:41:19.477 --> 00:41:24.003
Turning and burning and leaving
the bastard squirming.

553
00:41:24.046 --> 00:41:27.354
I think I'm gonna
give him a lead smile.

554
00:41:30.139 --> 00:41:31.706
I need a horse.

555
00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:33.403
Well. go ahead
and take mine there. boss.

556
00:41:33.447 --> 00:41:34.840
I'll ride up here in the wagon.

557
00:41:35.667 --> 00:41:36.972
Ohh...

558
00:41:46.329 --> 00:41:50.638
Hey. uh. you boys keep her warm
for me. will you? Whoa!

559
00:41:50.682 --> 00:41:52.814
We don't mind
obliging you there. boss.

560
00:41:52.858 --> 00:41:55.164
- Do we. boys?
- Yeah. No. not at all. man.

561
00:41:55.208 --> 00:41:57.253
Yeah. See you. boss.

562
00:41:57.297 --> 00:41:59.386
Laters.

563
00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:03.390
Yeah. We'll see you
down the road.

564
00:42:30.765 --> 00:42:31.766
Hold up.

565
00:42:34.203 --> 00:42:35.204
Ow.

566
00:42:38.599 --> 00:42:39.731
Just hold up.

567
00:42:44.257 --> 00:42:46.999
You guys can go ahead.

568
00:42:48.217 --> 00:42:50.480
I got some business
to attend to. - Yeah.

569
00:42:50.524 --> 00:42:52.831
How long are you gonna take?

570
00:42:52.874 --> 00:42:56.225
I don't know.
As long as it takes. Wanna write a book?

571
00:42:56.269 --> 00:42:57.444
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

572
00:42:57.487 --> 00:42:59.185
Called "The Shit I Put Up With."

573
00:42:59.228 --> 00:43:01.579
First chapter's on you.
Mr. Trot.

574
00:43:01.622 --> 00:43:03.668
- Gallup. It's Gallup.
- Mm.

575
00:43:03.711 --> 00:43:05.539
- Best remember that.
- Yeah. Sure. Mm-hmm.

576
00:43:05.583 --> 00:43:06.758
- Whatever.
- Mm.

577
00:43:09.108 --> 00:43:10.675
Unless you wanna
give me a hand.

578
00:43:10.718 --> 00:43:12.981
Oh. no. thank you
very much. sir.

579
00:43:14.896 --> 00:43:16.115
Disgusting.

580
00:43:22.904 --> 00:43:24.340
Jolene. good girl.

581
00:43:31.304 --> 00:43:33.698
- You know what a Comanchero is?
- Uh-uh.

582
00:43:36.048 --> 00:43:37.266
You don't wanna find out.

583
00:43:38.267 --> 00:43:41.140
- I think you're right. Okay.
- Come on.

584
00:43:46.275 --> 00:43:48.408
All right... Stay calm.

585
00:43:49.409 --> 00:43:51.454
- No!
- Stop right there. ladies.

586
00:43:51.498 --> 00:43:53.021
This way. Take her in.

587
00:43:53.065 --> 00:43:54.762
- Good girl.
- Let's go.

588
00:43:54.806 --> 00:43:58.374
- Alice. just do what they say.
- Shut up.

589
00:43:58.418 --> 00:44:00.028
- No. no!
- Let's go.

590
00:44:00.072 --> 00:44:03.031
Come on. come on.

591
00:44:05.991 --> 00:44:07.470
Damn.

592
00:44:09.864 --> 00:44:12.171
- Come on. this way. ladies.
- Let's go.

593
00:44:12.214 --> 00:44:13.259
Come on. let's go.

594
00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:16.088
If it ain't one thing.
it's another.

595
00:44:24.313 --> 00:44:26.402
Get up there.
You get up here.

596
00:44:29.101 --> 00:44:30.929
Huh? What do you got there?

597
00:44:31.886 --> 00:44:33.322
Little lady's companion?

598
00:44:37.413 --> 00:44:39.111
Are you hiding something too?

599
00:44:40.242 --> 00:44:42.680
- Wouldn't you like to know?
- Oh. I'm gonna know.

600
00:44:42.723 --> 00:44:44.638
You got something in here?

601
00:44:44.682 --> 00:44:45.987
What do we got here?

602
00:44:46.161 --> 00:44:48.598
Wouldn't you like to know?
Hmm? - What's this?

603
00:44:50.513 --> 00:44:52.777
Huh? What you hiding?

604
00:44:54.561 --> 00:44:55.693
Jiminez.

605
00:44:56.824 --> 00:44:59.697
Get over there.
Just get in the wagon.

606
00:45:00.698 --> 00:45:03.396
- No. no! No!
- Come on. Get in!

607
00:45:03.439 --> 00:45:05.354
- Get!
- No!

608
00:45:05.398 --> 00:45:07.095
No!

609
00:45:14.494 --> 00:45:16.278
No!

610
00:45:25.766 --> 00:45:28.334
Need a hand there.
<i>cabrón</i>?

611
00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:33.339
Hyah!

612
00:45:38.257 --> 00:45:40.346
Get off of her. you filthy pig!

613
00:45:41.695 --> 00:45:43.262
Lookie here. boys.

614
00:45:43.305 --> 00:45:44.829
- We got us a wildcat in here.
- No!

615
00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:49.921
Well. smile. darlin'.

616
00:45:49.964 --> 00:45:52.619
You're about to have
the time of your life!

617
00:45:52.662 --> 00:45:53.663
No!

618
00:46:00.061 --> 00:46:02.585
No!

619
00:46:05.371 --> 00:46:06.546
No!

620
00:46:09.854 --> 00:46:12.160
Hyah! Hyah!

621
00:46:20.603 --> 00:46:24.216
Why don't you. uh.
sing us some music?

622
00:46:24.259 --> 00:46:27.393
Because it's about to get
real romantic back here.

623
00:46:38.056 --> 00:46:39.187
No!

624
00:46:42.277 --> 00:46:44.149
No! Stop!

625
00:46:51.112 --> 00:46:52.113
No...

626
00:46:58.990 --> 00:47:00.774
- Hyah!
- Hyah!

627
00:47:00.818 --> 00:47:03.516
Hyah! Hyah!

628
00:47:07.868 --> 00:47:09.087
Gun belts. keys.

629
00:47:10.044 --> 00:47:11.480
- Hyah!
- Damn it!

630
00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:25.843
Come on! Giddy up!

631
00:47:28.062 --> 00:47:30.195
Giddy up! Giddy up!
Giddy up! Come on!

632
00:47:44.122 --> 00:47:47.821
Hyah! Get him! Get him!

633
00:48:21.768 --> 00:48:25.511
Ugh! Fuck!

634
00:48:25.554 --> 00:48:29.341
You know what I'd give
for a shot of snakebite right about now?

635
00:48:30.255 --> 00:48:33.998
I'd give
my two big toes. Yeah.

636
00:48:35.042 --> 00:48:37.740
Didn't the driver
have a bottle of something or other?

637
00:48:37.784 --> 00:48:39.742
- Yep. yep. Coming up.
- Oh!

638
00:48:39.786 --> 00:48:43.007
Check the wagon too.
I think our pistol and rifle were in there.

639
00:48:44.486 --> 00:48:47.054
- Here. Al.
- Thanks. Nora.

640
00:48:51.885 --> 00:48:54.844
- Here.
- Aren't you a sweetheart?

641
00:48:57.499 --> 00:48:59.023
Dammit.

642
00:49:08.423 --> 00:49:10.991
You know what I did right there?

643
00:49:12.471 --> 00:49:15.387
- What?
- How are you still standing?

644
00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:17.128
I can hold my liquor.

645
00:49:19.565 --> 00:49:22.437
The sun is about to set.
so we should--

646
00:49:22.481 --> 00:49:25.092
We should take off
'cause we got miles to cover.

647
00:49:25.136 --> 00:49:29.531
We got miles to cover.
Let's go. gals! Yeah. Yeah.

648
00:49:29.575 --> 00:49:31.446
You sure about that?

649
00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:33.622
Sure. Sure.

650
00:49:33.666 --> 00:49:35.320
Sure. I'm sure.

651
00:49:38.584 --> 00:49:40.760
Mm.

652
00:49:42.762 --> 00:49:43.893
It's funny.

653
00:49:46.113 --> 00:49:50.900
I ain't never seen a man spend
more time fallin' off his horse than ridin' it.

654
00:50:05.959 --> 00:50:09.615
Well. boys. at least the birds
ain't gonna peck your eyes out.

655
00:50:13.358 --> 00:50:17.579
You know. if Grimes
is worth 2.000 dollars.

656
00:50:17.623 --> 00:50:19.538
his gang must be worth
something. right?

657
00:50:21.148 --> 00:50:22.671
What do you think?

658
00:50:22.715 --> 00:50:25.065
Leather or lace?

659
00:50:26.501 --> 00:50:29.591
One's definitely
more practical than the other. especially out here.

660
00:50:30.766 --> 00:50:32.420
Yeah. You're right.

661
00:50:33.813 --> 00:50:34.988
Lace it is.

662
00:51:22.383 --> 00:51:24.559
What are you looking at?

663
00:51:27.127 --> 00:51:29.608
Admiring the scenery.
Ain't illegal. is it?

664
00:51:31.436 --> 00:51:33.829
If'n it was.
you'd be guilty as sin.

665
00:51:35.309 --> 00:51:38.573
I got urges.
same as every other man.

666
00:51:40.967 --> 00:51:44.492
Once you two are done
gallivanting around. we should make a fire.

667
00:51:45.928 --> 00:51:48.017
It's colder than a whore's heart
out here tonight.

668
00:51:49.323 --> 00:51:51.760
No offense. though.

669
00:51:57.288 --> 00:51:59.159
You still wanna go
through with this?

670
00:52:00.856 --> 00:52:03.381
I'm tired of whoring. Nora.

671
00:52:03.424 --> 00:52:05.122
I got more to offer this world
than just a good time.

672
00:52:07.341 --> 00:52:10.605
You been listening
to that bounty hunter far too much.

673
00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:14.957
If you don't love yourself.
ain't nobody gonna love you.

674
00:52:15.001 --> 00:52:19.658
Honey. I've been loved
by plenty of men plenty of times.

675
00:52:19.701 --> 00:52:23.009
Nora. Ain't nobody loved us.

676
00:52:23.052 --> 00:52:26.143
We just been used
over and over again.

677
00:52:26.186 --> 00:52:27.361
And you know what?

678
00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:31.757
And someday. ain't nobody
gonna wanna use us no more.

679
00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:33.324
You ever think about that?

680
00:52:36.805 --> 00:52:37.893
Well. you better start.

681
00:52:38.894 --> 00:52:42.637
'Cause once you're all used up.
death usually isn't too far off.

682
00:52:48.513 --> 00:52:49.775
Do you trust him?

683
00:52:56.651 --> 00:52:58.262
We need him.

684
00:52:58.392 --> 00:53:00.873
in more ways than one
if we wanna get out of this thing.

685
00:53:01.569 --> 00:53:03.136
He proved that today.

686
00:53:05.007 --> 00:53:07.227
Well. I don't like him.

687
00:53:07.271 --> 00:53:09.229
He's pricklier than a bearcat.

688
00:53:09.273 --> 00:53:11.405
You don't have to like him.

689
00:53:11.449 --> 00:53:14.103
But I'd do what he says
if you wanna live through this thing.

690
00:53:33.035 --> 00:53:34.863
And here I am without my gun.

691
00:53:36.169 --> 00:53:37.344
Where's Alice?

692
00:53:37.388 --> 00:53:39.738
I think she's just out
collecting firewood.

693
00:53:40.913 --> 00:53:42.175
Why ain't you helping her?

694
00:53:43.176 --> 00:53:45.439
I thought it'd be nice to take
a dip before it gets dark.

695
00:53:48.312 --> 00:53:53.404
Yeah. Well. unfortunately.
it's not big enough for the both of us here. so...

696
00:53:53.447 --> 00:53:55.101
- Really?
- Vamoose.

697
00:53:55.144 --> 00:53:57.234
I see plenty of room out here.

698
00:53:59.584 --> 00:54:02.195
- I seen you washing up earlier.
- Yeah.

699
00:54:02.239 --> 00:54:04.589
- Yeah?
- That was washin'.

700
00:54:04.632 --> 00:54:06.068
This is skinny-dippin'.

701
00:54:07.331 --> 00:54:08.723
Oh. relax!

702
00:54:09.724 --> 00:54:12.336
We're just two people
baring our thoughts out here.

703
00:54:13.467 --> 00:54:15.382
Yeah. bare-ass naked.

704
00:54:17.341 --> 00:54:19.517
What are you trying
to do to me? Huh?

705
00:54:20.996 --> 00:54:21.954
Huh.

706
00:54:23.085 --> 00:54:24.957
I think I just found your gun.

707
00:54:30.092 --> 00:54:31.572
I don't understand you.

708
00:54:32.747 --> 00:54:35.794
You know. most men would die
for a night with me.

709
00:54:35.837 --> 00:54:37.752
But here I am.
throwing myself at you

710
00:54:37.796 --> 00:54:39.928
and you just keep
pushing me away.

711
00:54:41.016 --> 00:54:44.411
Yeah. People want
what they can't have.

712
00:54:44.455 --> 00:54:46.108
It's a fact of life.

713
00:54:48.807 --> 00:54:50.112
What's wrong with me?

714
00:54:52.201 --> 00:54:53.464
Ain't I good-looking?

715
00:54:57.642 --> 00:54:59.948
Yep. Okay.

716
00:55:01.167 --> 00:55:02.603
Let's say I was interested.

717
00:55:02.647 --> 00:55:04.126
How many men you been with?

718
00:55:05.127 --> 00:55:07.956
I don't know.
Last counted a hundred.

719
00:55:09.567 --> 00:55:12.178
You have any other skills
besides pleasuring a man?

720
00:55:12.221 --> 00:55:13.614
Sure. I do.

721
00:55:14.746 --> 00:55:17.183
Yeah? Gimme just one.

722
00:55:17.226 --> 00:55:18.924
Well. I can. uh...

723
00:55:20.534 --> 00:55:21.709
You know. um...

724
00:55:21.753 --> 00:55:23.320
I'm really good at. uh...

725
00:55:24.321 --> 00:55:26.235
Yeah. That's what I thought.

726
00:55:27.498 --> 00:55:29.500
I mean. if you ain't a whore.
then what are ya?

727
00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:34.069
Besides. what if--
what if Alice found us?

728
00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:37.377
I think she'd probably join us.

729
00:55:39.205 --> 00:55:42.339
We've shared men before.
We just charge double for that.

730
00:55:43.252 --> 00:55:45.907
But seeing as you don't have
any money. you know what I'll do?

731
00:55:45.951 --> 00:55:48.519
I'm willing to extend you
a line of credit.

732
00:55:48.562 --> 00:55:49.650
Say...

733
00:55:50.651 --> 00:55:52.523
fifty dollars out of your share.

734
00:55:54.612 --> 00:55:57.092
I can get myself a good horse
for 50 dollars.

735
00:56:09.844 --> 00:56:11.672
What's gotten into her?

736
00:56:11.716 --> 00:56:13.500
I think she's trying
to figure that out.

737
00:56:16.111 --> 00:56:18.026
What's gotten into you?

738
00:56:25.556 --> 00:56:26.470
Howdy!

739
00:56:28.602 --> 00:56:29.864
Ain't you gonna do something?

740
00:56:30.125 --> 00:56:33.041
Well. I'm not exactly armed
and dangerous at the moment.

741
00:56:33.868 --> 00:56:36.436
Honey. you don't happen
to speak Apache. do you?

742
00:56:59.154 --> 00:57:01.635
Where did you learn
to speak Apache?

743
00:57:02.636 --> 00:57:05.596
When I was little. my parents
died on a trip out west.

744
00:57:05.639 --> 00:57:06.988
The Mescaleros took me in.

745
00:57:07.989 --> 00:57:11.166
Apache were some
of my first customers. - Really?

746
00:57:13.517 --> 00:57:14.996
What did you. uh...

747
00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:16.911
What did you say to him?

748
00:57:16.955 --> 00:57:19.261
Just. you know. you and I
tried to make love

749
00:57:19.305 --> 00:57:21.307
but you couldn't get it up.

750
00:57:32.927 --> 00:57:34.407
Oh. well...

751
00:57:42.067 --> 00:57:44.722
Shit. I burned myself.

752
00:57:47.725 --> 00:57:50.075
They doing what I think
they're doing back there?

753
00:57:50.118 --> 00:57:51.990
- Uh-huh.
- Shit.

754
00:57:57.865 --> 00:57:59.301
You guys do your own makeup?

755
00:58:02.174 --> 00:58:03.218
What?

756
00:58:04.089 --> 00:58:06.526
You're not the only one
who gets urges.

757
00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:11.096
Get yourself
a new rifle?

758
00:58:12.184 --> 00:58:13.490
I did.

759
00:58:15.622 --> 00:58:18.016
- Yeah.
- Ahem.

760
00:58:18.059 --> 00:58:19.321
Y'all have a good time?

761
00:58:20.584 --> 00:58:21.846
Wouldn't you like to know?

762
00:58:22.847 --> 00:58:24.544
Not really.
I'm just being courteous.

763
00:58:24.588 --> 00:58:25.850
Oh. yeah. Oops.

764
00:58:26.851 --> 00:58:27.852
That's good.

765
00:58:28.853 --> 00:58:30.289
Adds to the flavor.

766
00:58:31.638 --> 00:58:32.987
What did you. uh--

767
00:58:33.161 --> 00:58:35.294
what did you learn about
our newfound friends here. huh?

768
00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:42.127
Well. um. they were asking
about the Apache girl we were with.

769
00:58:42.170 --> 00:58:44.216
- Ah. they are. are they?
- That's her father.

770
00:58:44.259 --> 00:58:46.740
Instead of fooling
around with that. why don't you. uh.

771
00:58:46.784 --> 00:58:49.787
get back to the task at hand.
which is Grimes?

772
00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:55.009
You don't wanna upset
an armed Apache.

773
00:58:57.229 --> 00:58:58.273
Why not?

774
00:59:08.022 --> 00:59:11.939
Well. I don't trust 'em
as far as I can throw 'em.

775
00:59:15.987 --> 00:59:18.163
You sure Grimes
is coming out this way?

776
00:59:19.947 --> 00:59:23.211
This is the only watering hole.
He's coming this way.

777
00:59:23.255 --> 00:59:26.345
Yeah. I'll take
first watch Damn.

778
00:59:26.388 --> 00:59:28.608
Good night. Mr. Gallup.

779
00:59:29.609 --> 00:59:30.784
Well. I would say good night.

780
00:59:30.958 --> 00:59:34.092
but every night with you
has been anything but...

781
01:00:22.967 --> 01:00:24.751
Don't shoot. it's only me.

782
01:00:26.797 --> 01:00:28.233
Aren't you lucky?

783
01:00:30.104 --> 01:00:31.453
What are you doing up?

784
01:00:31.497 --> 01:00:33.238
Oh. I couldn't sleep.

785
01:00:33.281 --> 01:00:35.283
- Here. I'll take that.
- Ooh.

786
01:00:36.676 --> 01:00:37.895
Yeah.

787
01:00:39.723 --> 01:00:43.378
I brought you
some strawberry preserves with some biscuits.

788
01:00:44.336 --> 01:00:46.120
Well. much obliged.

789
01:00:48.383 --> 01:00:51.560
Well. you and Nora.
you are one hell of a pair.

790
01:00:52.692 --> 01:00:54.520
Sweet and sour.

791
01:00:54.563 --> 01:00:56.087
Yeah and you're all salt.

792
01:00:58.045 --> 01:00:59.612
Well. yeah. I suppose

793
01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:01.875
- I am an acquired taste.
- Mm-hmm.

794
01:01:04.704 --> 01:01:05.662
Mm.

795
01:01:07.272 --> 01:01:11.580
Out here women ain't got much
of a choice other than cookin'.

796
01:01:11.624 --> 01:01:14.061
- teachin'. marryin'. or--
- Whoring? Yeah.

797
01:01:19.632 --> 01:01:23.201
Most men. they ain't looking
to get hitched to the likes of me and Nora.

798
01:01:25.594 --> 01:01:27.727
Well... Hmm.

799
01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:30.382
You never fancied
being a schoolmarm?

800
01:01:30.425 --> 01:01:32.471
Oh. No.

801
01:01:33.428 --> 01:01:35.300
No. I'd probably
break my switch

802
01:01:35.343 --> 01:01:36.867
- the first day.
- Oh.

803
01:01:36.910 --> 01:01:38.738
"Spare the rod.
spoil the child."

804
01:01:38.782 --> 01:01:41.567
That's what my Pa
used to say. Mm.

805
01:01:41.610 --> 01:01:43.525
Man. he was a drunk.
A mean drunk.

806
01:01:44.526 --> 01:01:45.745
But still. I. uh...

807
01:01:46.746 --> 01:01:48.748
He hated himself
more than he hated me.

808
01:01:52.491 --> 01:01:53.927
Why didn't you leave there?

809
01:01:55.363 --> 01:01:58.366
We had but one horse. Yeah.

810
01:01:58.410 --> 01:02:00.107
And if he caught me
trying to steal it.

811
01:02:00.151 --> 01:02:02.544
he wouldn't hesitate
to put a bullet in my back.

812
01:02:03.850 --> 01:02:09.813
But. you know. I figured out
that he robbed a bank. killed a teller.

813
01:02:09.856 --> 01:02:12.380
and there was a bounty
on his head.

814
01:02:12.424 --> 01:02:16.167
Yeah. So. he passed out
one night. right?

815
01:02:16.210 --> 01:02:20.824
And I hog-tied him.
stole his horse.

816
01:02:20.867 --> 01:02:23.478
and dragged his ass
all the way to jail.

817
01:02:25.219 --> 01:02:27.831
Four hundred dollar bounty
for that one. First one too.

818
01:02:29.136 --> 01:02:30.094
Hmm.

819
01:02:31.008 --> 01:02:34.533
Got me this gun.
got a fast horse.

820
01:02:35.926 --> 01:02:37.884
I stayed for the hanging.

821
01:02:38.885 --> 01:02:42.236
After that.
I just rode out of town. Never been back.

822
01:02:43.368 --> 01:02:44.325
Hmm.

823
01:02:48.329 --> 01:02:50.505
I came all the way from Georgia.

824
01:02:52.812 --> 01:02:54.379
My husband-to-be...

825
01:02:55.815 --> 01:02:58.165
He was one hell
of a letter writer.

826
01:03:00.994 --> 01:03:05.738
It only took two
before he had my head full of romantic notions. And. um...

827
01:03:06.913 --> 01:03:10.830
he said that he had a big ranch
with all these cattle

828
01:03:10.874 --> 01:03:14.007
that could make any a dream
I ever have wanted come true.

829
01:03:14.965 --> 01:03:15.922
Hm.

830
01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:22.276
You were a mail-order
bride. huh?

831
01:03:25.845 --> 01:03:27.673
Never got around
to the bride part.

832
01:03:31.459 --> 01:03:35.289
I will never forget
the first time I laid eyes on him.

833
01:03:35.333 --> 01:03:39.206
He was just lying there
in that pine box at the funeral parlor.

834
01:03:40.425 --> 01:03:43.210
Damn. What. uh... what happened?

835
01:03:48.433 --> 01:03:52.219
His neighbors. uh.
they reckon that he...

836
01:03:54.874 --> 01:03:57.746
His horse spooked and he fell
and hit his head on a rock.

837
01:03:58.835 --> 01:04:00.837
His neck was broke
when they found him.

838
01:04:02.447 --> 01:04:05.319
But. well--
bright side

839
01:04:05.363 --> 01:04:07.713
you get his. uh...

840
01:04:07.756 --> 01:04:10.977
His spread. his cattle. right?
Inherit all that.

841
01:04:11.021 --> 01:04:13.937
No. No. I...

842
01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:16.635
I would've been if we would've
been married. but. um...

843
01:04:18.550 --> 01:04:19.638
His kin.

844
01:04:21.031 --> 01:04:24.556
They took everything.
right down to the last heifer

845
01:04:24.599 --> 01:04:28.777
and it wasn't long before
I needed a place to go and needed me a job.

846
01:04:32.259 --> 01:04:34.131
Yeah. that's tough.

847
01:04:34.174 --> 01:04:38.744
So. um. the cathouse.
that was the... The only thing hiring. huh?

848
01:04:44.837 --> 01:04:48.014
When you're starving
and you got no place to go.

849
01:04:48.058 --> 01:04:49.886
you do what you gotta do
to survive.

850
01:04:49.929 --> 01:04:51.017
Here.

851
01:04:57.284 --> 01:04:59.112
It's just a question. Jesus.

852
01:05:03.464 --> 01:05:05.858
Hey. Get up.

853
01:05:07.033 --> 01:05:08.121
Hey!

854
01:05:14.084 --> 01:05:16.173
You weren't here
when I got up last night.

855
01:05:18.436 --> 01:05:20.003
You two get horizontal?

856
01:05:22.570 --> 01:05:23.615
No!

857
01:05:24.877 --> 01:05:28.402
I brought him
some biscuits. We talked.

858
01:05:30.274 --> 01:05:33.320
Well. if I didn't know you
better. honey. I'd say you've lost your touch.

859
01:05:34.539 --> 01:05:35.670
I have.

860
01:05:37.455 --> 01:05:40.371
You know. if he was
any more asleep. he'd be dead.

861
01:05:44.114 --> 01:05:45.680
Last night's coffee
still in the cup?

862
01:05:46.638 --> 01:05:47.813
Sure is.

863
01:05:47.856 --> 01:05:49.641
It's cold. though.

864
01:05:49.684 --> 01:05:51.208
Suppose I could make some more.

865
01:05:56.039 --> 01:05:59.520
What the hell
did you do that for?

866
01:05:59.564 --> 01:06:01.131
Just giving you
a morning coffee.

867
01:06:01.174 --> 01:06:03.872
Always helps me get up
and face the day.

868
01:06:03.916 --> 01:06:06.614
I prefer to drink it. In a cup.

869
01:06:06.658 --> 01:06:09.835
You know. I swear I saw some
go down your throat.

870
01:06:12.925 --> 01:06:14.666
Where'd the Apache go?

871
01:06:14.709 --> 01:06:16.537
Same place we're headed.

872
01:06:16.581 --> 01:06:17.974
And hell ain't waitin'.

873
01:06:19.584 --> 01:06:23.109
Hyah!

874
01:06:34.729 --> 01:06:36.514
Ain't that strange?

875
01:06:38.385 --> 01:06:39.908
Tracks from another horse.

876
01:06:40.953 --> 01:06:43.042
Do you think Grimes
could've gotten another horse?

877
01:06:43.086 --> 01:06:44.609
Don't know.

878
01:06:44.696 --> 01:06:48.743
You know. those Comancheros
did say something about him.

879
01:06:50.876 --> 01:06:52.617
You're just telling us that now?

880
01:06:54.619 --> 01:06:55.663
My God.

881
01:07:02.627 --> 01:07:03.671
Here.

882
01:07:10.243 --> 01:07:11.810
Come on! Hyah. hyah. hyah!

883
01:07:12.767 --> 01:07:15.553
Hyah. hyah. hyah!

884
01:07:19.252 --> 01:07:20.558
Hyah. hyah!

885
01:07:45.235 --> 01:07:47.541
We can just camp up here. Ow.

886
01:07:48.586 --> 01:07:49.717
It's getting late.

887
01:07:50.805 --> 01:07:53.982
You'll feel better
once you get some food and some rest in ya.

888
01:07:54.026 --> 01:07:55.767
You been riding hard all day.

889
01:07:59.510 --> 01:08:01.816
Well. take a load off.

890
01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:03.992
We'll make camp. Thanks. hon.

891
01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:08.214
Yeah. I think I could use
some-- some shut-eye.

892
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:13.828
Bust out the vittles. Nora.
This train's coming to a stop.

893
01:08:21.053 --> 01:08:23.403
So what sounds good
for supper. Mister--

894
01:09:03.878 --> 01:09:06.098
Okay. so look. I. um...

895
01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:08.318
I just--
I wanna tell you something.

896
01:09:08.361 --> 01:09:10.320
Okay. but listen with both ears.

897
01:09:10.363 --> 01:09:12.496
'cause I'm only
gonna say it once.

898
01:09:12.539 --> 01:09:13.540
All right?

899
01:09:15.586 --> 01:09:17.370
Harder than I thought. Um...

900
01:09:18.632 --> 01:09:21.635
My preconceived notions
about your career...

901
01:09:23.594 --> 01:09:26.640
Maybe they--
they blurred my vision some?

902
01:09:27.641 --> 01:09:31.645
I mean. I saw you
for who you were. what you did.

903
01:09:33.299 --> 01:09:34.996
I mean. not-- not who you are.

904
01:09:36.215 --> 01:09:37.825
And it was damn
shortsighted of me.

905
01:09:38.913 --> 01:09:40.524
And small-minded.

906
01:09:40.567 --> 01:09:41.655
Both. I guess.

907
01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:44.223
Um...

908
01:09:44.267 --> 01:09:46.965
I mean. I reckon that. you know.
people. if they would--

909
01:09:47.008 --> 01:09:51.404
they would take the time to see
each other as they are. then...

910
01:09:51.448 --> 01:09:54.233
Well. there'd be
a whole lot more meeting in the middle.

911
01:09:55.234 --> 01:09:58.194
A lot less pissed people off
running around.

912
01:09:59.717 --> 01:10:02.241
Man. that's such a tangent.
what are you talking about?

913
01:10:02.285 --> 01:10:05.723
Anyways. look. I... I thought
I'd be better at this. Um...

914
01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:09.292
I just want you
to know that I. uh...

915
01:10:09.335 --> 01:10:12.643
I've come to respect you.
I really have.

916
01:10:12.686 --> 01:10:15.646
And I've come to. uh...
I don't know.

917
01:10:15.689 --> 01:10:16.951
Admire you even.

918
01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:20.172
Maybe even love you. I guess.

919
01:10:21.478 --> 01:10:24.655
If you could see yourself
with someone by the likes of me...

920
01:10:26.961 --> 01:10:29.225
That's it?
Ah. what the hell you know.

921
01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:32.793
You old crow bait. Hey.

922
01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:37.102
How long you been
standing there?

923
01:10:40.105 --> 01:10:43.064
We were just chatting
about life.

924
01:10:44.022 --> 01:10:45.066
Come on.

925
01:11:04.347 --> 01:11:06.131
Sure can be lonely out here.

926
01:11:09.961 --> 01:11:11.789
You still thinking about Orin?

927
01:11:13.747 --> 01:11:14.792
Orin?

928
01:11:15.836 --> 01:11:17.011
Who's Orin?

929
01:11:20.406 --> 01:11:21.799
Old flame of hers.

930
01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:29.546
Yeah. those don't really
burn out. do they?

931
01:11:31.112 --> 01:11:32.375
What?

932
01:11:32.418 --> 01:11:34.028
Old flames.

933
01:11:35.421 --> 01:11:38.598
They just
keep on simmering.

934
01:11:40.557 --> 01:11:42.515
Months. years.

935
01:11:47.041 --> 01:11:48.913
Antelopes that run in the wind.

936
01:11:49.870 --> 01:11:51.002
Cheers to you.

937
01:11:54.048 --> 01:11:55.311
Where's she at now?

938
01:11:59.315 --> 01:12:01.969
With her ancestors. I reckon.

939
01:12:04.842 --> 01:12:07.584
She got. um. smallpox.

940
01:12:08.585 --> 01:12:13.807
We were. uh. trading down
at Fort Lowell nigh on. uh...

941
01:12:15.679 --> 01:12:17.420
fifteen years ago.

942
01:12:17.463 --> 01:12:20.336
I would do anything.

943
01:12:20.379 --> 01:12:22.729
I would drop my guns
if I could bring her back.

944
01:12:23.991 --> 01:12:26.646
That gal. she meant
more to me than...

945
01:12:29.954 --> 01:12:31.999
You know.
I'm not the crying kind. but...

946
01:12:33.827 --> 01:12:35.133
that just...

947
01:12:36.134 --> 01:12:39.050
that just crushed me. you know?

948
01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:46.492
But. I. uh...

949
01:12:47.885 --> 01:12:53.369
I will definitely shed
a few tears of joy when I kill Grimes.

950
01:12:53.412 --> 01:12:55.240
Or maybe I'll just--
I don't know.

951
01:12:56.197 --> 01:12:58.025
Piss on his dead corpse.

952
01:12:58.069 --> 01:13:00.245
One or the other.
I can't quite decide.

953
01:13:00.288 --> 01:13:03.117
It's more of a "in the moment"
type of decision.

954
01:13:51.644 --> 01:13:53.603
Past noon and you haven't
moved a muscle.

955
01:14:03.482 --> 01:14:06.398
Well. I suppose
I was plum tuckered.

956
01:14:07.399 --> 01:14:09.488
Fit as a busted fiddle
now. though.

957
01:14:09.532 --> 01:14:10.620
Hungry?

958
01:14:14.145 --> 01:14:15.799
Oh. damn!

959
01:14:17.061 --> 01:14:19.150
Hey. you wanna wash this up
and I'll get some bacon on?

960
01:14:20.281 --> 01:14:21.979
Whoa! Scatter!

961
01:14:35.427 --> 01:14:36.994
You see him?

962
01:14:37.037 --> 01:14:38.735
If I did. he'd be dead.

963
01:14:40.171 --> 01:14:41.781
That you down there. Gallup?

964
01:14:44.262 --> 01:14:45.437
The one and only!

965
01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:48.005
You may as well
give up. Grimes.

966
01:14:48.048 --> 01:14:50.964
I got two deputies
from town with me.

967
01:14:51.008 --> 01:14:52.879
and they're both dead shots.

968
01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:59.799
Well. I ain't never seen
no deputies with pointy tits!

969
01:15:00.626 --> 01:15:02.672
Pointy? They ain't pointy!

970
01:15:02.715 --> 01:15:05.544
- Shush! Shush!
- Well. they ain't!

971
01:15:07.503 --> 01:15:11.028
Now I aim to see you
dead and buried when this day's done.

972
01:15:13.683 --> 01:15:15.554
I didn't know you cared so much.

973
01:15:16.990 --> 01:15:20.733
Most people would say
I ain't worth burying!

974
01:15:20.777 --> 01:15:24.955
Truth be told. I just need
your head to collect the bounty.

975
01:15:27.348 --> 01:15:28.828
I'll be real quick with it.

976
01:15:31.135 --> 01:15:36.009
That's mighty big words
from a man hiding behind whores.

977
01:15:37.707 --> 01:15:39.360
How'd you know they were whores?

978
01:15:40.710 --> 01:15:43.626
'Cause there ain't
no self-respecting woman

979
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:47.325
that'd be out here
running around alone.

980
01:15:47.368 --> 01:15:52.199
Someone ran 'em off
from somewhere! - Decent? I'll show him decent!

981
01:15:59.903 --> 01:16:03.167
Nora. enough. All right. Enough.

982
01:16:04.385 --> 01:16:06.387
All right. well. why don't you
go round up the horses?

983
01:16:06.431 --> 01:16:08.041
Watch your ass.

984
01:16:08.085 --> 01:16:09.695
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

985
01:16:16.223 --> 01:16:18.051
- Think you can cover me?
- Yep.

986
01:16:19.575 --> 01:16:20.967
There you go. there you go!

987
01:16:36.722 --> 01:16:38.942
Come on guys. let's go.

988
01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:49.996
You all right?

989
01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:51.389
I'll be a damn sight better

990
01:16:51.519 --> 01:16:53.391
when that asshole's
shaking hands with the devil.

991
01:16:53.434 --> 01:16:56.481
I told you it wasn't gonna be
no fun and games.

992
01:16:56.524 --> 01:16:58.222
It's kill or be killed out here.

993
01:17:55.888 --> 01:17:57.760
No! No!

994
01:17:59.762 --> 01:18:01.285
Oh. my God. no!

995
01:18:14.211 --> 01:18:17.475
Promise me you won't let
that son of a bitch get away.

996
01:18:17.518 --> 01:18:21.566
I promise. I won't.
I swear we'll get him.

997
01:18:21.609 --> 01:18:24.308
I'm not talking about Grimes.

998
01:18:30.923 --> 01:18:32.925
I told you this was a bad idea.

999
01:18:32.969 --> 01:18:36.407
I'm so sorry. Nora.
I'm so sorry.

1000
01:18:38.409 --> 01:18:42.195
At least I get to go out
with a bang. huh?

1001
01:18:42.239 --> 01:18:43.327
No!

1002
01:18:45.111 --> 01:18:46.591
No!

1003
01:18:47.853 --> 01:18:49.376
No!

1004
01:18:57.907 --> 01:18:59.822
No!

1005
01:19:01.954 --> 01:19:03.042
No!

1006
01:19:10.702 --> 01:19:13.574
Please. no! No!

1007
01:19:13.618 --> 01:19:15.576
She's-- Nora. no!

1008
01:19:16.621 --> 01:19:18.971
Oh. God!

1009
01:19:40.471 --> 01:19:42.386
No!

1010
01:20:02.058 --> 01:20:03.407
Could you give us a minute...

1011
01:20:04.364 --> 01:20:05.975
alone. please?

1012
01:20:24.732 --> 01:20:25.864
Lord. I...

1013
01:20:28.824 --> 01:20:30.434
Nora had a good soul.

1014
01:20:33.002 --> 01:20:35.265
Despite what others
may have said about her...

1015
01:20:39.269 --> 01:20:42.968
she was a true friend.
of which I never had many.

1016
01:20:45.405 --> 01:20:49.148
And she-- she may have lived
a wicked way. but she--

1017
01:20:51.716 --> 01:20:55.676
She was trying to change
for her sake. And for yours. and...

1018
01:20:58.114 --> 01:21:01.769
I-- I just hope
that you will take that into consideration

1019
01:21:01.813 --> 01:21:07.906
before you pass judgment on her.
and me. for what I'm about to do in her name.

1020
01:21:09.168 --> 01:21:10.866
Hey. come on.

1021
01:21:11.867 --> 01:21:13.738
Stop. stop. stop. stop. stop.

1022
01:21:20.614 --> 01:21:21.789
Hang on.

1023
01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:30.798
Sorry about Nora.

1024
01:21:33.497 --> 01:21:35.760
You know. me and you.

1025
01:21:36.892 --> 01:21:38.197
we ain't that different.

1026
01:21:40.025 --> 01:21:41.374
Come again?

1027
01:21:41.418 --> 01:21:43.420
Killing for a living's a sin.

1028
01:21:43.463 --> 01:21:45.857
Same as selling your body.
maybe even more so.

1029
01:21:48.207 --> 01:21:49.513
Yeah. maybe you're right.

1030
01:21:49.556 --> 01:21:51.036
Guess we're all sinners.

1031
01:21:52.081 --> 01:21:54.387
- So says the good book. right?
- Yeah.

1032
01:21:55.475 --> 01:21:59.915
I guess there's something about
forgiveness in there too. though. right?

1033
01:22:02.047 --> 01:22:03.179
Reckon so.

1034
01:22:04.441 --> 01:22:06.704
Planning on forgiving Grimes
for killing Nora?

1035
01:22:07.748 --> 01:22:09.446
Hell. no.

1036
01:22:09.489 --> 01:22:11.883
That son of a bitch is gonna get
what's coming to him.

1037
01:23:03.717 --> 01:23:05.719
You know what.
why don't you hop down

1038
01:23:07.069 --> 01:23:09.636
and fix Jolene's pack there?

1039
01:23:10.942 --> 01:23:12.161
I'll take a look around.

1040
01:23:21.257 --> 01:23:22.736
Son of a bitch.

1041
01:23:23.911 --> 01:23:25.174
All right. let's move.

1042
01:23:25.217 --> 01:23:26.784
You see something?

1043
01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:28.786
I see Grimes.

1044
01:23:33.573 --> 01:23:34.705
Come on.

1045
01:24:40.510 --> 01:24:43.121
- Damn it!
- I didn't have time to finish hitching.

1046
01:24:43.165 --> 01:24:45.428
I can curse myself. can't I?

1047
01:24:45.471 --> 01:24:47.821
I only have one good arm.
Did the best I could.

1048
01:24:47.865 --> 01:24:50.955
Why didn't you fetch me?
I would've helped you.

1049
01:24:52.261 --> 01:24:53.958
You know what. Alice?

1050
01:24:54.001 --> 01:24:57.483
I just kind of figured
that you had a lot on your mind. you know?

1051
01:24:58.484 --> 01:25:00.747
Nora dying and all that.
just didn't wanna bother you.

1052
01:25:00.791 --> 01:25:03.054
Well. I do appreciate
the sentiment.

1053
01:25:03.098 --> 01:25:05.839
but now. what are we gonna
eat tonight besides nothing?

1054
01:25:49.187 --> 01:25:50.536
Oh. dear!

1055
01:25:53.539 --> 01:25:56.760
Hey. You got a plan?

1056
01:25:58.544 --> 01:25:59.589
Well...

1057
01:26:01.068 --> 01:26:02.331
Well?

1058
01:26:02.374 --> 01:26:04.289
I'm formulating one. Yeah.

1059
01:26:04.333 --> 01:26:05.464
Okay.

1060
01:26:06.639 --> 01:26:08.206
Hey. I promise.

1061
01:26:09.599 --> 01:26:11.253
We'll make it
through this. Yeah?

1062
01:26:11.296 --> 01:26:12.863
Yeah. I know.

1063
01:26:12.906 --> 01:26:14.952
You'd be the first man
to keep his promise to a whore.

1064
01:26:21.741 --> 01:26:24.179
I'd never be caught dead
kissing a whore.

1065
01:26:26.659 --> 01:26:29.009
All right? Now.
that you are an honest woman.

1066
01:26:30.054 --> 01:26:32.970
I'd be happy to spend
the rest of my life kissing you.

1067
01:26:33.013 --> 01:26:34.232
Ready?

1068
01:26:38.454 --> 01:26:40.586
Gallup. you still kickin'?

1069
01:26:42.066 --> 01:26:44.111
Where'd you learn
how to bounce bullets?

1070
01:26:46.157 --> 01:26:48.638
Spent some time
in a Wild West show.

1071
01:26:49.813 --> 01:26:53.164
Sharpshooters there
taught me a trick or two.

1072
01:26:53.208 --> 01:26:54.687
Worked out well

1073
01:26:55.645 --> 01:26:57.995
when I was robbing
their box office!

1074
01:26:59.214 --> 01:27:03.174
Maybe it's time to give up
outlawing and join the circus.

1075
01:27:03.218 --> 01:27:06.221
Yeah. you'll make
one hell of a bearded lady.

1076
01:27:06.264 --> 01:27:08.701
Die. you limp-legged bastard!

1077
01:27:08.745 --> 01:27:10.225
Jeez!

1078
01:27:10.268 --> 01:27:12.444
Are you-- Was part of your plan
pissing him off?

1079
01:27:13.315 --> 01:27:16.666
Figured it couldn't hurt.
seeing as we're up shit's creek.

1080
01:27:19.712 --> 01:27:21.105
Give me your empty gun.

1081
01:27:24.239 --> 01:27:26.066
All right. you ready to end
this turkey shoot?

1082
01:27:26.110 --> 01:27:29.200
Sure am. I like my tail feathers
where they're at.

1083
01:27:30.332 --> 01:27:31.333
Grimes.

1084
01:27:33.335 --> 01:27:34.988
You got your trading pants on?

1085
01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:39.906
Why? Are you out of cartridges?

1086
01:27:41.430 --> 01:27:46.391
Yeah. that's why I'm firing
insults and not lead.

1087
01:27:47.697 --> 01:27:48.741
Well...

1088
01:27:50.874 --> 01:27:52.179
what are your terms?

1089
01:27:55.226 --> 01:27:56.183
My...

1090
01:27:57.141 --> 01:27:59.578
My life for my pack mule.

1091
01:27:59.622 --> 01:28:02.364
Nope. Too thin.

1092
01:28:03.365 --> 01:28:05.497
The pack mule and a horse.

1093
01:28:05.541 --> 01:28:08.021
that's a deal more to my liking.

1094
01:28:09.327 --> 01:28:13.288
I'd be happy to oblige.
but the gal I was with. she rode off on him.

1095
01:28:14.289 --> 01:28:17.379
And left me in a lurch
when you...

1096
01:28:17.422 --> 01:28:19.163
when you shot her best friend.

1097
01:28:21.426 --> 01:28:24.690
So you trust me
to give you a fair shake?

1098
01:28:24.734 --> 01:28:26.649
Ain't got much choice now. do I?

1099
01:28:28.955 --> 01:28:30.217
All right. Gallup.

1100
01:28:31.306 --> 01:28:32.829
Throw out your weapon.

1101
01:28:33.656 --> 01:28:37.312
trot out the mule.
and I'll let you live.

1102
01:28:37.355 --> 01:28:39.618
For about one damn minute.

1103
01:28:42.142 --> 01:28:43.230
All right.

1104
01:28:44.580 --> 01:28:46.538
Yeah.

1105
01:28:54.590 --> 01:28:57.941
Come on. come on. come on.

1106
01:28:57.984 --> 01:28:59.334
Come on. come on.

1107
01:29:01.988 --> 01:29:03.773
I'm coming on down.

1108
01:29:05.078 --> 01:29:07.516
Feel free to hobble out
at your leisure.

1109
01:29:38.634 --> 01:29:40.200
Yeah. I'll admit.

1110
01:29:40.244 --> 01:29:43.378
as far as plans go.
that was a mighty clever one.

1111
01:29:44.509 --> 01:29:46.163
Yeah. it just kind
of popped in my head

1112
01:29:46.206 --> 01:29:48.905
as soon as he started talking
about the Wild West.

1113
01:29:48.948 --> 01:29:50.341
You know. trick riding.

1114
01:29:52.561 --> 01:29:54.998
Now. listen. Any...

1115
01:29:55.041 --> 01:29:56.869
Any woman who will risk
her life for me...

1116
01:29:58.131 --> 01:30:00.003
that's one hell of a gal
in my book.

1117
01:30:01.352 --> 01:30:05.008
Well. coming from a crippled up
old bounty hunter.

1118
01:30:05.051 --> 01:30:06.618
I'll take that as a compliment.

1119
01:30:09.621 --> 01:30:12.102
People try to kill me
damn near every day.

1120
01:30:12.145 --> 01:30:14.974
It could mean that I need
a career change.

1121
01:30:15.018 --> 01:30:16.193
Well...

1122
01:30:17.977 --> 01:30:20.632
you can do a lot of thinking
on 2.000 dollars.

1123
01:30:20.676 --> 01:30:22.504
You can bet on that.

1124
01:30:22.547 --> 01:30:25.028
Well. I'm gonna go
get the-- the critters.

1125
01:30:29.293 --> 01:30:30.337
Eldon!

1126
01:30:32.035 --> 01:30:33.906
No! No!

1127
01:30:37.301 --> 01:30:38.345
No!

1128
01:30:46.136 --> 01:30:47.659
Die! Die!

1129
01:30:50.662 --> 01:30:51.924
What'd I ever do to you?

1130
01:31:31.311 --> 01:31:32.399
No!

1131
01:31:36.926 --> 01:31:37.970
No!

1132
01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:29.516
Get out of the way.

1133
01:33:32.128 --> 01:33:34.957
Alice. What's going on?

1134
01:33:39.570 --> 01:33:41.920
Sheriff. I'm here for my bounty.
