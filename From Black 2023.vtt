00:03:17.632 --> 00:03:20.722
-911. What's your emergency?

4
00:03:20.765 --> 00:03:24.769
-Please. Please send someone.

5
00:03:24.813 --> 00:03:26.771
-Tell me what's going on.
ma'am.

6
00:03:29.034 --> 00:03:32.168
-Just send someone.

7
00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:35.215
-Deputies are already on
the way. ma'am. Are you hurt?

8
00:03:37.434 --> 00:03:40.307
-I don't know.

9
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.874
I-I have to get out.

10
00:04:01.328 --> 00:04:04.374
-Ma'am. are you still there?

11
00:04:04.418 --> 00:04:06.158
-I can't get out.

12
00:04:12.513 --> 00:04:14.558
He could still be here.

13
00:04:46.024 --> 00:04:48.331
-Found her sitting in
the middle of the room.

14
00:04:48.375 --> 00:04:50.028
-Which room?

15
00:04:50.072 --> 00:04:51.595
-The bad one.

16
00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:54.294
-The bad one?

17
00:04:54.337 --> 00:04:55.947
Is she hurt?

18
00:04:55.991 --> 00:04:59.734
-Medic says she's pretty
dehydrated. but fine otherwise.

19
00:04:59.777 --> 00:05:03.128
It's someone else's blood.

20
00:05:03.172 --> 00:05:06.436
We haven't been able
to ID her yet.

21
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.438
-Loewen.

22
00:05:08.482 --> 00:05:09.961
-Sorry?

23
00:05:10.005 --> 00:05:12.050
-Her name is Cora Loewen.

24
00:05:18.753 --> 00:05:20.798
Hey. Cora.

25
00:05:21.886 --> 00:05:25.020
You need anything? You want
some water or something?

26
00:05:39.948 --> 00:05:42.254
Can you tell me what happened?

27
00:05:48.652 --> 00:05:51.176
Can you tell me whose blood
is all over you?

28
00:05:55.267 --> 00:05:57.357
-I just wanted him back.

29
00:06:03.058 --> 00:06:05.843
He told me
we could get him back.

30
00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:09.586
-Who told you?

31
00:06:13.416 --> 00:06:16.027
-I really thought
that we could get him back.

32
00:06:18.465 --> 00:06:20.162
-No.

33
00:06:24.035 --> 00:06:25.733
Cora.

34
00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:30.215
It's been seven years.

35
00:07:06.513 --> 00:07:08.166
-Wyatt.

36
00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.430
Wyatt! Wyatt.

37
00:07:11.387 --> 00:07:14.216
Hey! Wake up.

38
00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:17.175
You got to help me hide
all this shit.

39
00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:18.525
Fuck.

40
00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:29.884
-Are you Noah Loewen's mother?

41
00:07:31.755 --> 00:07:33.409
-What is this?

42
00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:36.847
-Do you know where
your son is. Ms. Loewen?

43
00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:39.676
-Yeah. of course.
Of course I do.

44
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.373
Okay. What the fuck is this?

45
00:07:41.417 --> 00:07:42.853
-We're just following up on
the welfare check. ma'am.

46
00:07:42.897 --> 00:07:45.334
-Can you just go confirm
that he's here. please?

47
00:08:11.012 --> 00:08:13.971
-Center 15 send two.

48
00:08:14.015 --> 00:08:16.321
That's a negative
at the residence.

49
00:08:55.143 --> 00:09:02.498
-The pain of losing someone
close to us can feel unbearable.

50
00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:05.893
Loneliness. helplessness.

51
00:09:05.936 --> 00:09:07.808
Just a feeling that
no one else

52
00:09:07.851 --> 00:09:11.376
on the planet Earth could
possibly understand.

53
00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:15.337
And yet everyone in this circle
has felt that way

54
00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:19.341
to one degree or another
at some point.

55
00:09:19.384 --> 00:09:23.519
And just to have the courage
to sit in this room.

56
00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:27.610
to be here together.
for this kind of healing.

57
00:09:27.654 --> 00:09:32.528
that is the first step
toward taking back control.

58
00:09:34.748 --> 00:09:38.926
Just gives me this warm feeling
in my heart knowing that it

59
00:09:38.969 --> 00:09:41.537
might give you just
a tiny bit of comfort

60
00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:43.800
to hear it and to share it.

61
00:09:43.844 --> 00:09:47.325
Because having this group
has given

62
00:09:47.369 --> 00:09:49.066
the loss of my Beverly a meaning

63
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:51.112
that I just never thought
would have been possible.

64
00:09:51.155 --> 00:09:54.550
And I owe that to everyone.

65
00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:59.076
All right. well. we got pivot
to Thursday for next week

66
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:04.865
because bingo
has the room reserved.

67
00:10:04.908 --> 00:10:09.130
All right.
Thanks for coming. you guys.

68
00:10:09.173 --> 00:10:11.480
-Today is his birthday.

69
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.533
Or...

70
00:10:21.577 --> 00:10:24.667
it would have been.

71
00:10:24.711 --> 00:10:26.930
It would have been his birthday.

72
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.809
I've never really shared here.

73
00:10:39.116 --> 00:10:42.554
I think because I thought that
just by coming.

74
00:10:42.598 --> 00:10:46.776
I was somehow
moving forward or

75
00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:50.127
working towards something.

76
00:10:50.171 --> 00:10:53.957
Healing. Maybe. I don't know.

77
00:10:56.090 --> 00:11:00.224
Looking for an answer
to a question. I guess.

78
00:11:02.923 --> 00:11:05.534
I think I might have just been
kidding myself.

79
00:11:08.885 --> 00:11:11.061
There probably isn't an answer.

80
00:11:14.848 --> 00:11:19.417
But I search and I search
for that thing.

81
00:11:19.461 --> 00:11:23.030
You know. that little thing
that just might help

82
00:11:23.073 --> 00:11:26.729
trigger something
or help me remember.

83
00:11:26.773 --> 00:11:29.253
But there's just nothing.

84
00:11:32.822 --> 00:11:36.173
There's just staying high.

85
00:11:36.217 --> 00:11:39.307
That is all there fucking was.

86
00:11:42.005 --> 00:11:44.747
And I didn't care what
anybody did to me

87
00:11:44.791 --> 00:11:49.099
or what anybody took from me
as long as I was high.

88
00:11:52.581 --> 00:11:55.540
And I promised myself
that I would be sober

89
00:11:55.584 --> 00:11:58.630
when he came back to me.

90
00:11:58.674 --> 00:12:03.940
And I have been sober
a very long time now.

91
00:12:05.855 --> 00:12:09.598
I mean. I don't even know
how I'm supposed to act anymore.

92
00:12:09.641 --> 00:12:12.601
You know?
Or what I'm supposed to feel.

93
00:12:12.644 --> 00:12:16.213
I mean. what am I supposed
to do with all this?

94
00:12:18.999 --> 00:12:22.480
Am I supposed to hold out hope?

95
00:12:22.524 --> 00:12:26.484
I mean. a mother is supposed
to hold out hope. right?

96
00:12:28.182 --> 00:12:31.620
What kind of mother would I be
if I just gave up hope?

97
00:12:42.892 --> 00:12:45.112
But what if I just
don't have any?

98
00:12:49.681 --> 00:12:52.075
What if this is all
just bullshit?

99
00:13:12.879 --> 00:13:14.750
Guess it's about
that time of year.

100
00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:17.753
-Hey. Cora.
-Allison.

101
00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:19.189
-I was in the area. so...

102
00:13:19.233 --> 00:13:21.713
-Yeah? Well. I'm fine.

103
00:13:21.757 --> 00:13:24.194
You can cross this off
your guilty conscience list

104
00:13:24.238 --> 00:13:27.197
or whatever it is you do.

105
00:13:27.241 --> 00:13:30.026
-I'm around. you know?
-You're around?

106
00:13:31.898 --> 00:13:33.987
You want to go grab a beer?

107
00:13:38.252 --> 00:13:41.037
-How are you. um --
How are you doing?

108
00:13:43.561 --> 00:13:45.259
-Existing.

109
00:13:49.219 --> 00:13:50.742
Today. um...

110
00:13:50.786 --> 00:13:53.571
-Yeah. I know what today is.

111
00:14:02.058 --> 00:14:04.408
-I see how people look at me.
you know?

112
00:14:06.236 --> 00:14:08.456
-Probably just don't even know
what to say.

113
00:14:08.499 --> 00:14:10.545
-Yeah.

114
00:14:10.588 --> 00:14:13.548
Well. when they
do say something.

115
00:14:13.591 --> 00:14:16.943
I spend the whole conversation
comforting them.

116
00:14:18.118 --> 00:14:20.685
I mean. how does that work?

117
00:14:20.729 --> 00:14:22.296
And then they end it
with some bullshit

118
00:14:22.339 --> 00:14:23.732
they don't even mean.

119
00:14:23.775 --> 00:14:25.125
I swear to God.

120
00:14:25.168 --> 00:14:26.735
if I hear
"We're in this together"

121
00:14:26.778 --> 00:14:29.129
from one more fucking person...

122
00:14:35.222 --> 00:14:37.137
I miss Mom.

123
00:14:39.052 --> 00:14:41.054
-Yeah. I do. too.

124
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:47.234
But that big house
feels pretty quiet.

125
00:14:47.277 --> 00:14:49.453
-Well. I actually
kind of like it.

126
00:14:51.325 --> 00:14:53.457
Just me and my ghost.

127
00:14:55.982 --> 00:14:58.941
Noah loved that house.

128
00:14:58.985 --> 00:15:00.421
You know. she kept
a room for him?

129
00:15:00.464 --> 00:15:03.511
-Yeah. I know.
-Yeah.

130
00:15:03.554 --> 00:15:06.079
I sleep in there sometimes.

131
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:11.823
Sorry.
I forget how to talk to people.

132
00:15:14.043 --> 00:15:16.828
-Look. um...

133
00:15:16.872 --> 00:15:18.308
I'm not going to pretend

134
00:15:18.352 --> 00:15:20.310
that I know what it's like
to live your life.

135
00:15:20.354 --> 00:15:24.445
But. for what it's worth.

136
00:15:24.488 --> 00:15:27.839
it never leaves me.

137
00:15:27.883 --> 00:15:30.799
Not even for a second.

138
00:15:30.842 --> 00:15:33.889
-That came pretty close to
"We're in this together."

139
00:15:46.249 --> 00:15:49.209
-Hey.

140
00:15:49.252 --> 00:15:51.167
You got to go.

141
00:15:54.736 --> 00:15:56.346
Something wrong?

142
00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:59.175
-No. you just --
You just got to go.

143
00:17:29.352 --> 00:17:32.703
-Cora. I cannot do
anything to help you unless

144
00:17:32.747 --> 00:17:34.836
you tell me what happened.

145
00:17:36.881 --> 00:17:43.410
Cora. let me help you. Okay?
I really do want to help you.

146
00:17:53.855 --> 00:17:56.597
-There was a man.

147
00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.338
-What?

148
00:18:02.385 --> 00:18:05.475
-There was a man.

149
00:18:05.519 --> 00:18:08.348
-♪ How could you

150
00:18:08.391 --> 00:18:12.221
♪ Love me. love

151
00:18:19.054 --> 00:18:20.969
-What can I get you?

152
00:18:21.012 --> 00:18:22.405
-Hey.

153
00:18:22.449 --> 00:18:24.407
-Hey. What's up?

154
00:18:24.451 --> 00:18:27.671
-I was just in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd grab a bite.

155
00:18:27.715 --> 00:18:30.718
What's -- What's good?

156
00:18:30.761 --> 00:18:33.024
-Good?

157
00:18:33.068 --> 00:18:37.507
Um. the burgers are safe.

158
00:18:37.551 --> 00:18:40.293
Meat loaf. not so much.

159
00:18:42.556 --> 00:18:44.645
-Let's live dangerously.

160
00:18:47.909 --> 00:18:49.867
-Meat loaf.

161
00:19:01.314 --> 00:19:02.532
-Mm. Thank you.

162
00:19:02.576 --> 00:19:05.100
-Mm-hmm.

163
00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.148
-You can do that?
-What?

164
00:19:09.191 --> 00:19:10.758
Oh. well. I'm off in a few.

165
00:19:10.801 --> 00:19:13.500
and there ain't
nobody here anyway.

166
00:19:13.543 --> 00:19:16.198
What are you.
the waitress police?

167
00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.158
-You want anything
besides water?

168
00:19:19.201 --> 00:19:20.942
-No.

169
00:19:23.684 --> 00:19:25.947
What?

170
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:28.993
Don't be weird.

171
00:19:29.037 --> 00:19:33.476
-It's...your button.

172
00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.652
My little girl's favorite movie.

173
00:19:35.696 --> 00:19:37.437
-Oh.

174
00:19:39.047 --> 00:19:41.441
-It's Noah's. too.

175
00:19:41.484 --> 00:19:45.923
-Huh. You know.
there's this theory.

176
00:19:47.795 --> 00:19:50.885
The entire story
was in the dad's mind.

177
00:19:50.928 --> 00:19:55.846
Male clown fish
are known to eat their eggs.

178
00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:57.631
-Hm.
-They'll protect the nest.

179
00:19:57.674 --> 00:19:59.894
Make sure everyone's safe.

180
00:19:59.937 --> 00:20:02.157
Then turn around
and just start...

181
00:20:03.724 --> 00:20:06.640
The theory is that the dad
ate all the kids.

182
00:20:06.683 --> 00:20:10.818
so he never really
even ever had Nemo.

183
00:20:10.861 --> 00:20:14.691
So he goes on this journey.
just...

184
00:20:14.735 --> 00:20:18.129
goes off searching for him
to ease his conscience.

185
00:20:23.134 --> 00:20:24.353
-That's dark.

186
00:20:29.184 --> 00:20:35.016
Hey. I --
I really need to thank you.

187
00:20:35.059 --> 00:20:38.672
-Thank me?
-For sharing.

188
00:20:38.715 --> 00:20:44.112
I know that's no small thing.
and it helps people.

189
00:20:44.155 --> 00:20:47.768
We're all alone until
we find out that we're not.

190
00:20:47.811 --> 00:20:49.857
-Well. that just
kind of came out.

191
00:20:51.946 --> 00:20:53.904
I mean. I'm glad if it might
have helped somebody.

192
00:20:53.948 --> 00:20:57.168
but my motivation
was not that noble.

193
00:21:05.568 --> 00:21:09.529
-It actually means
"nobody" in Latin.

194
00:21:13.359 --> 00:21:18.581
-So the movie is actually called
"Finding Nobody"?

195
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:26.110
Are you okay?

196
00:21:31.942 --> 00:21:33.901
Meat loaf.

197
00:21:42.997 --> 00:21:46.522
-No!

198
00:21:46.566 --> 00:21:48.655
-You've ruined everything.

199
00:21:53.921 --> 00:21:56.532
-Her clothing get processed?
-Confirmed.

200
00:21:56.576 --> 00:21:57.881
-Blood swaps?

201
00:21:57.925 --> 00:21:59.492
-Everything's off
to the lab in the a.m.

202
00:21:59.535 --> 00:22:02.495
-What about. um. 911 calls.
missing persons reports.

203
00:22:02.538 --> 00:22:05.715
anything like that?
-No. nothing.

204
00:22:05.759 --> 00:22:08.239
-Who the fuck's blood
is on you. Cora?

205
00:22:08.283 --> 00:22:09.719
-An animal maybe?

206
00:22:09.763 --> 00:22:11.417
-What?
-You saw all that creepy shit.

207
00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:13.636
What if it came from
a. I don't know.

208
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.290
goat or something?

209
00:22:15.334 --> 00:22:17.379
-Field kits showed
presumptive positive

210
00:22:17.423 --> 00:22:21.296
for human hemoglobin. Detective.

211
00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.906
Is she a hype. Sarge?

212
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:24.386
-In her day.

213
00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:28.390
-Well. she's got
to be using then.

214
00:22:28.434 --> 00:22:30.174
-Maybe.

215
00:22:59.682 --> 00:23:02.598
-Hey. Hey.

216
00:23:02.642 --> 00:23:04.165
-Hey.

217
00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:10.258
-You stopped coming to group.

218
00:23:12.739 --> 00:23:15.785
-Yeah. I think -- I'm really
busy right now. so...

219
00:23:20.834 --> 00:23:23.140
-Can I come in for one minute?

220
00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:27.971
-I don't really
think that that's...

221
00:23:28.015 --> 00:23:29.756
-For a minute.

222
00:23:31.975 --> 00:23:34.804
We've all been
a little worried.

223
00:23:34.848 --> 00:23:35.892
-I'm fine.

224
00:23:35.936 --> 00:23:38.286
-How can we help?
-Okay.

225
00:23:41.115 --> 00:23:43.596
I don't think
I can do it anymore.

226
00:23:45.293 --> 00:23:46.816
Group. It's just --

227
00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.253
it's all getting to me
a little bit too much.

228
00:23:51.952 --> 00:23:55.608
-Is there any way I can
convince you to come back?

229
00:23:55.651 --> 00:23:56.957
-I really appreciate

230
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.395
everything
that you've done for me.

231
00:24:00.439 --> 00:24:03.833
I really. really do.

232
00:24:03.877 --> 00:24:07.489
I mean. it is far more than
anybody else has bothered.

233
00:24:07.533 --> 00:24:11.014
but. uh. I just -- I can't do
this anymore.

234
00:24:11.058 --> 00:24:13.016
Any of it.

235
00:24:16.933 --> 00:24:19.893
-Cora. how badly do you
want to heal?

236
00:24:22.983 --> 00:24:25.464
-How what?

237
00:24:26.421 --> 00:24:28.989
What kind of question is that?

238
00:24:29.032 --> 00:24:30.947
-What if I told you...

239
00:24:36.605 --> 00:24:40.304
What if I told you there was
a way to truly heal all of this?

240
00:24:42.176 --> 00:24:43.525
-Thank you.

241
00:24:43.569 --> 00:24:46.485
But I am all tapped out
on the self-help.

242
00:24:46.528 --> 00:24:49.879
-No. no. I mean really.

243
00:24:51.707 --> 00:24:53.448
Heal it.

244
00:24:56.277 --> 00:24:57.974
Fix it.

245
00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:06.940
What if you could see him again?

246
00:25:09.464 --> 00:25:11.335
-Is that supposed to be funny?

247
00:25:14.034 --> 00:25:15.862
I mean. what the fuck
does that even mean?

248
00:25:15.905 --> 00:25:17.864
-Exactly what I just said.

249
00:25:17.907 --> 00:25:20.344
-Mm.

250
00:25:20.388 --> 00:25:23.609
Like some
metaphysical bullshit?

251
00:25:23.652 --> 00:25:26.525
Like a like a seance
or something?

252
00:25:28.657 --> 00:25:31.573
-Something like that.

253
00:25:33.619 --> 00:25:36.360
Okay. um...

254
00:25:36.404 --> 00:25:39.450
I really do appreciate
your concern. but. uh.

255
00:25:39.494 --> 00:25:43.150
I got things that
I got to do. so...

256
00:25:43.193 --> 00:25:44.891
-You do?

257
00:25:47.937 --> 00:25:51.811
What do you have to do to?

258
00:25:51.854 --> 00:25:55.771
-I don't know. Things.

259
00:25:55.815 --> 00:25:59.949
Real tangible things
that I can touch with my hands

260
00:25:59.993 --> 00:26:01.472
and I can see with my eyes.

261
00:26:01.516 --> 00:26:05.868
-Cora. I am offering you
a chance to undo this.

262
00:26:07.609 --> 00:26:09.480
-Cora. you know what happened
to me. right?

263
00:26:09.524 --> 00:26:10.873
You know I lost my little girl.

264
00:26:10.917 --> 00:26:12.483
-Mm-hmm.

265
00:26:17.532 --> 00:26:19.795
-Well. I got her back.

266
00:26:19.839 --> 00:26:21.580
-What?

267
00:26:23.407 --> 00:26:25.192
-She's alive.

268
00:26:25.235 --> 00:26:26.497
-Please. Go.

269
00:26:26.541 --> 00:26:28.369
-She's alive.

270
00:26:28.412 --> 00:26:31.198
I got her back.

271
00:26:31.241 --> 00:26:32.808
She's alive and well.
I'm telling you.

272
00:26:32.852 --> 00:26:35.245
-Bye-bye.
-She's alive.

273
00:26:42.688 --> 00:26:44.515
Yeah.

274
00:27:00.575 --> 00:27:03.186
-Cora?

275
00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:06.625
What did he mean by that?
That he got his daughter back?

276
00:27:10.629 --> 00:27:13.066
God damn it. Cora.
You got to help me out here.

277
00:27:13.109 --> 00:27:14.328
Why did he say that?

278
00:27:14.371 --> 00:27:16.025
-Because it was true.

279
00:27:16.069 --> 00:27:18.462
-What was true? That he found
his daughter somewhere?

280
00:27:18.506 --> 00:27:22.728
-No. No. He brought her back.

281
00:27:22.771 --> 00:27:24.860
-Back? From where?

282
00:27:24.904 --> 00:27:27.733
-Fuck. I don't know.
Where do you go when you die?

283
00:27:27.776 --> 00:27:30.779
- Jesus Christ.

284
00:27:30.823 --> 00:27:34.565
-I'm telling you. you don't
know every fucking thing.

285
00:27:34.609 --> 00:27:37.351
-Yeah. well. let me tell you
what I do know.

286
00:27:37.394 --> 00:27:39.179
I know that
that little girl is dead

287
00:27:39.222 --> 00:27:42.312
because I saw them pull her
lifeless body out of the water.

288
00:27:42.356 --> 00:27:44.097
Mill County got the guy. Cora.

289
00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:45.968
It was some carny
out of Sioux Falls.

290
00:27:46.012 --> 00:27:48.231
I mean. full confession.
physical evidence.

291
00:27:48.275 --> 00:27:51.321
And did I mention a body?

292
00:27:51.365 --> 00:27:54.368
-She is alive.

293
00:27:54.411 --> 00:27:56.718
They changed her last name
to the ex-wife's.

294
00:27:56.762 --> 00:27:59.982
and they moved to some
richy bitch part of Boston.

295
00:28:00.026 --> 00:28:03.725
Alive and well.
I'm fucking telling you.

296
00:28:05.771 --> 00:28:08.948
Becky or Beverly or some shit.

297
00:28:10.297 --> 00:28:12.995
Go look it up
on your back computer.

298
00:28:25.225 --> 00:28:27.227
Jesus.

299
00:28:33.581 --> 00:28:35.278
-Tell me.

300
00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.762
-I'd feel better if --

301
00:28:40.806 --> 00:28:43.983
-No. Right here.

302
00:28:56.909 --> 00:29:00.129
-When they...

303
00:29:00.173 --> 00:29:04.568
found -- when they pulled her
from the water.

304
00:29:04.612 --> 00:29:07.180
she was...

305
00:29:07.223 --> 00:29:09.922
you know...

306
00:29:09.965 --> 00:29:12.620
the...

307
00:29:12.663 --> 00:29:16.929
Fish had gotten to her.
She'd been down there a while.

308
00:29:19.845 --> 00:29:22.108
She was still so beautiful.

309
00:29:24.153 --> 00:29:26.677
So beautiful.

310
00:29:26.721 --> 00:29:30.681
It was not long after that
when. uh...

311
00:29:30.725 --> 00:29:35.686
a woman came to find me.

312
00:29:37.863 --> 00:29:41.257
She was -- I still don't know.

313
00:29:43.303 --> 00:29:45.305
But she started to tell me
these things.

314
00:29:45.348 --> 00:29:47.786
She told me
what I'm telling you.

315
00:29:50.049 --> 00:29:53.443
There is a way to get them back.

316
00:29:56.882 --> 00:29:59.667
-Back from where?

317
00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:01.669
-Wherever it is they go.

318
00:30:03.062 --> 00:30:06.413
-I'm going to get in your truck.

319
00:30:06.456 --> 00:30:08.415
But only because I'm cold.

320
00:30:10.199 --> 00:30:12.419
But if it gets weird...

321
00:30:12.462 --> 00:30:15.335
Just don't be weird.

322
00:30:20.209 --> 00:30:21.689
-It's a ritual.

323
00:30:21.732 --> 00:30:23.865
-Like a seance?
-No.

324
00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:25.649
It's like a ritual.

325
00:30:28.391 --> 00:30:33.005
It's old. like Mesopotamian
or something.

326
00:30:33.048 --> 00:30:37.052
I swear on my life
that I did this.

327
00:30:37.096 --> 00:30:40.099
I did this. and it worked.

328
00:30:40.142 --> 00:30:42.057
Look. you know what
happened to her.

329
00:30:42.101 --> 00:30:45.234
Everybody around here knows.
They just know.

330
00:30:45.278 --> 00:30:49.238
The same way they
know your story.

331
00:30:49.282 --> 00:30:51.588
But you know she's alive.
don't you?

332
00:30:57.203 --> 00:30:59.161
You wouldn't be here.

333
00:31:22.837 --> 00:31:24.665
-Hello?

334
00:31:24.708 --> 00:31:27.537
Uh. yeah. No. I'm sorry.
She's passed.

335
00:31:27.581 --> 00:31:30.018
Yeah. This is your daughter.

336
00:31:30.062 --> 00:31:31.672
No. the other one.

337
00:31:31.715 --> 00:31:33.326
Mm-hmm.

338
00:31:33.369 --> 00:31:36.633
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right.

339
00:32:02.181 --> 00:32:04.313
What the fuck am I doing?

340
00:33:47.503 --> 00:33:51.942
♪ Where. oh. where
could the little boy be? ♪

341
00:33:51.986 --> 00:33:57.296
♪ The monster mom
needs tickles to live ♪

342
00:34:02.518 --> 00:34:03.954
-Boo!
-Oh!

343
00:34:03.998 --> 00:34:06.435
I found you. Mr. Magoo.

344
00:34:10.135 --> 00:34:11.701
Oh. that tickles!

345
00:35:03.013 --> 00:35:05.146
-Yeah. She left me.

346
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:06.713
-I know.

347
00:35:06.756 --> 00:35:08.106
-Yeah. A long time ago.

348
00:35:08.149 --> 00:35:11.892
Right when Nolan went missing.

349
00:35:11.935 --> 00:35:13.937
-Noah.

350
00:35:13.981 --> 00:35:19.073
-Oh. yeah. Well -- yeah. right.

351
00:35:19.117 --> 00:35:21.162
-You're served.

352
00:35:21.206 --> 00:35:23.251
-The fuck?

353
00:35:23.295 --> 00:35:25.340
-You stay away from her house.

354
00:35:25.384 --> 00:35:26.863
-I'll go where the fuck I want.

355
00:35:26.907 --> 00:35:28.256
-Yeah. well. that
paper says otherwise.

356
00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:31.477
100 yards.
You have a nice day.

357
00:35:33.914 --> 00:35:35.785
-Hey!

358
00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:39.572
Hey. how's it feel to know that
you're just shitty at your job?

359
00:35:39.615 --> 00:35:44.011
I mean. you did --
you did find his. um.

360
00:35:44.054 --> 00:35:45.621
his shoe. though. right?

361
00:35:45.665 --> 00:35:47.145
So you got that going for you.

362
00:35:47.188 --> 00:35:48.798
You didn't completely
go home empty handed.

363
00:35:48.842 --> 00:35:50.322
but then you just
sort of gave up.

364
00:35:50.365 --> 00:35:51.714
I mean. who does that?

365
00:35:51.758 --> 00:35:54.804
Who -- who gives up
on a missing kid?

366
00:35:54.848 --> 00:35:58.112
And may-- Maybe it was
just too tough.

367
00:35:58.156 --> 00:35:59.505
You know. tough case.

368
00:36:01.246 --> 00:36:03.770
Too tough for a lady cop.
I'm a feminist.

369
00:36:03.813 --> 00:36:05.641
You know. I'm all for --
I'm on your side.

370
00:36:05.685 --> 00:36:08.427
I want to get you up there
on top and on the bottom

371
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:10.211
and down on your knees.
rolling around.

372
00:36:10.255 --> 00:36:12.213
What's up. lady cop?
You forget something?

373
00:36:12.257 --> 00:36:13.649
-Well. you got a syringe

374
00:36:13.693 --> 00:36:15.303
sticking out of
your pocket. Wyatt.

375
00:36:15.347 --> 00:36:16.565
-Fuck my life.

376
00:36:16.609 --> 00:36:17.914
-What about any weapons?

377
00:36:17.958 --> 00:36:19.568
You got any weapons
in the trailer

378
00:36:19.612 --> 00:36:21.091
that I need to worry about?
No. no. no. no. no. no.

379
00:36:21.135 --> 00:36:22.528
Don't even think about it.

380
00:36:22.571 --> 00:36:24.356
-Hey. Hey.

381
00:36:25.792 --> 00:36:29.622
-You stay away from Cora.
You understand me?

382
00:36:32.146 --> 00:36:34.931
-If she's looking for an excuse.

383
00:36:34.975 --> 00:36:37.717
-Just say it.

384
00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:40.241
-Yeah. big sister to the rescue?

385
00:36:40.285 --> 00:36:43.113
-Say it.

386
00:36:43.157 --> 00:36:46.160
-Yeah. I got to stay away.

387
00:36:46.204 --> 00:36:49.555
-You want to pick that up?
Go ahead.

388
00:36:49.598 --> 00:36:51.644
I gave you permission.

389
00:36:55.343 --> 00:36:56.953
That paper says 100 yards.

390
00:36:56.997 --> 00:36:59.521
But I want you to pretend
it says 100 miles.

391
00:36:59.565 --> 00:37:01.480
Can you say that for me?

392
00:37:03.438 --> 00:37:06.354
-Hundred miles.

393
00:37:06.398 --> 00:37:08.748
-Good boy.

394
00:37:12.534 --> 00:37:15.276
His name is Noah.
piece of shit.

395
00:37:24.807 --> 00:37:26.896
-Any electronics in the house?

396
00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:29.464
-Uh. no.

397
00:37:29.508 --> 00:37:32.815
No. like Internet or anything.

398
00:37:32.859 --> 00:37:35.035
I mean. there's one.
like. tiny spot

399
00:37:35.078 --> 00:37:39.300
on the upstairs near the floor
that you can get cell reception.

400
00:37:39.344 --> 00:37:41.084
-Okay. good.

401
00:37:41.128 --> 00:37:44.305
No. we don't want any -- any
interference. no distraction.

402
00:37:44.349 --> 00:37:45.741
This is...

403
00:37:45.785 --> 00:37:47.917
-...real pine soap?

404
00:37:47.961 --> 00:37:49.702
-Mm-hmm.

405
00:37:56.883 --> 00:37:58.319
-And the salt?

406
00:37:58.363 --> 00:38:00.452
-Yeah. that's kosher.
Like you told me to.

407
00:38:00.495 --> 00:38:05.370
-Good. No. that's good.
Table salt has iodine in it.

408
00:38:05.413 --> 00:38:08.982
It has to be kosher or sea salt.

409
00:38:09.025 --> 00:38:11.027
It's a very specific.

410
00:38:11.071 --> 00:38:14.074
-The afterlife is finicky
about its condiments.

411
00:38:16.729 --> 00:38:19.862
-Look. I understand
if you're not completely sold

412
00:38:19.906 --> 00:38:24.606
on all of this.
but I need to know right now

413
00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:26.173
how committed that you are.

414
00:38:26.216 --> 00:38:30.873
This -- this is very real.
and any deviation --

415
00:38:30.917 --> 00:38:32.353
-I didn't mean to offend you
or anything.

416
00:38:32.397 --> 00:38:33.702
I really didn't.
-I under--

417
00:38:33.746 --> 00:38:35.008
-I just. I'm sorry.
This is like --

418
00:38:35.051 --> 00:38:39.404
It's all like. you know.
I mean. come on.

419
00:38:39.447 --> 00:38:42.798
There's. like. a damn shackle
bolted to the floor.

420
00:38:42.842 --> 00:38:44.626
for Christ's sake.
-Alright. we should just --

421
00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:45.888
We should just call this off.

422
00:38:45.932 --> 00:38:47.107
-What?
-No. this cannot

423
00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:49.936
be done half way!
-No. no!

424
00:38:53.287 --> 00:38:56.203
-I'm sorry.

425
00:38:56.246 --> 00:38:57.813
Sorry.

426
00:38:59.772 --> 00:39:03.210
-I...I'm...sorry.

427
00:39:03.253 --> 00:39:05.168
I'm sorry. I...

428
00:39:05.212 --> 00:39:08.084
Listen. I agreed to this.
and -- and you're right.

429
00:39:08.128 --> 00:39:11.349
I'll do whatever it is
that you tell me I need to do.

430
00:39:11.392 --> 00:39:13.351
And I'm sorry.

431
00:39:15.875 --> 00:39:18.399
Truly.

432
00:39:18.443 --> 00:39:22.621
-This is going
to be very painful.

433
00:39:22.664 --> 00:39:24.100
I cannot stress that enough.

434
00:39:24.144 --> 00:39:27.147
It is something
that you have never known.

435
00:39:30.411 --> 00:39:32.021
-Okay.

436
00:39:34.807 --> 00:39:36.722
-We're gonna need
to get you clean.

437
00:39:36.765 --> 00:39:39.028
-Salt bath thing.
-Yeah.

438
00:39:45.165 --> 00:39:46.775
Hey. Cora.

439
00:39:48.473 --> 00:39:50.257
-Yeah?

440
00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:52.912
-I'm not coming in. Are you --
Are you in the bath?

441
00:39:52.955 --> 00:39:55.436
-I am.

442
00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:57.917
-I forgot to tell you
about the salt.

443
00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:03.792
So the salt creates
a protective layer.

444
00:40:03.836 --> 00:40:07.666
But also -- it also absorbs
negative energy.

445
00:40:07.709 --> 00:40:10.059
-That's great. Thank you.

446
00:40:10.103 --> 00:40:13.106
-Okay. so once you once
you soak in it.

447
00:40:13.149 --> 00:40:15.021
you're going to scrub with it
like I showed you.

448
00:40:15.064 --> 00:40:17.632
and then rinse with clean water.

449
00:40:17.676 --> 00:40:20.809
All those impurities
will go down the drain.

450
00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:25.597
-Awesome.

451
00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.294
-Okay. You got it?

452
00:40:27.337 --> 00:40:30.036
-I got it. Thank you.

453
00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:34.214
-I'll be downstairs.

454
00:40:35.694 --> 00:40:37.826
-Make yourself at home.

455
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:47.445
Can I ask you something?

456
00:40:47.488 --> 00:40:49.185
-Of course.

457
00:40:52.841 --> 00:40:55.757
-Why is there so much sadness
in your eyes?

458
00:41:00.327 --> 00:41:03.417
-Is there?
-Yeah.

459
00:41:03.461 --> 00:41:05.941
Yeah. there is.
and I can see it. but I just.

460
00:41:05.985 --> 00:41:08.466
I can't figure it out.

461
00:41:08.509 --> 00:41:11.512
I mean. you got her back. right?

462
00:41:11.556 --> 00:41:16.125
You thought you lost her.
but you got her back.

463
00:41:16.169 --> 00:41:17.866
No strings.

464
00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:22.871
-You know I haven't
seen her. right?

465
00:41:25.831 --> 00:41:28.877
-What?

466
00:41:28.921 --> 00:41:30.923
Are you serious?

467
00:41:41.934 --> 00:41:44.893
I just have some...

468
00:41:44.937 --> 00:41:48.941
thing to take care of
before I go.

469
00:41:53.032 --> 00:41:55.904
She's safe with her mother.

470
00:41:55.948 --> 00:41:58.559
I'll go out there
and visit her as soon as I

471
00:41:58.603 --> 00:42:00.779
get everything squared away.

472
00:42:16.882 --> 00:42:19.580
-Whoa. whoa. whoa. What?

473
00:42:19.624 --> 00:42:20.973
-It's for your protection.

474
00:42:21.016 --> 00:42:22.757
-My protection?
What does that mean?

475
00:42:22.801 --> 00:42:24.716
Wait. you never told me that
this fucking thing was for me.

476
00:42:24.759 --> 00:42:26.413
-You're only going
to need this for today.

477
00:42:26.456 --> 00:42:29.764
After this. it won't be
necessary. I promise.

478
00:42:32.419 --> 00:42:35.814
You have to remember
everything you're going through.

479
00:42:35.857 --> 00:42:37.772
I have done.

480
00:42:37.816 --> 00:42:41.254
This is...

481
00:42:41.297 --> 00:42:42.603
This is just how it works.

482
00:42:42.647 --> 00:42:44.997
You either trust
me or you don't.

483
00:42:53.527 --> 00:42:54.920
-Too tight?

484
00:42:54.963 --> 00:43:00.055
-Um. I don't know. It's...

485
00:43:01.143 --> 00:43:04.103
No. it's great.

486
00:43:04.146 --> 00:43:08.237
-Look. this part is the most
physically demanding of you.

487
00:43:08.281 --> 00:43:10.326
Especially because you're
so malnourished

488
00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:12.111
and probably. you know...

489
00:43:12.154 --> 00:43:14.287
But it was very important.

490
00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:16.942
critical to get all those
impurities out of your system.

491
00:43:16.985 --> 00:43:18.813
You did exactly
what you needed to do. okay?

492
00:43:18.857 --> 00:43:20.423
-Great. Can we just.
like. get the show

493
00:43:20.467 --> 00:43:21.947
on the road here and tell me
what I have to do?

494
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:25.428
-Nothing.
Don't do anything.

495
00:43:25.472 --> 00:43:27.169
You just stand there.

496
00:43:27.213 --> 00:43:29.955
Just be open.

497
00:43:29.998 --> 00:43:33.654
Repeat the rite exactly
as I say it.

498
00:43:33.698 --> 00:43:36.396
And -- and no sitting.

499
00:43:36.439 --> 00:43:37.832
Stand only. It's very important.

500
00:43:37.876 --> 00:43:39.138
-I got it. I got it. Let's go.

501
00:43:39.181 --> 00:43:40.356
-That's important.

502
00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.097
-I get it.

503
00:43:48.669 --> 00:43:51.019
-We come of our own accord.

504
00:43:53.239 --> 00:43:55.328
-We come of our own accord.

505
00:43:55.371 --> 00:43:58.418
-We seek only that which
is made available to us.

506
00:44:00.246 --> 00:44:04.424
-We seek only that which
is made available to us.

507
00:44:05.643 --> 00:44:07.470
-We reject the natural order

508
00:44:07.514 --> 00:44:10.909
and remove ourselves
from the spiritual covering...

509
00:44:11.997 --> 00:44:14.260
...of life

510
00:44:14.303 --> 00:44:18.351
-We reject the natural order
and remove ourselves

511
00:44:18.394 --> 00:44:21.310
from the spiritual
covering of life.

512
00:44:59.305 --> 00:45:01.481
-Can we stop?

513
00:45:06.442 --> 00:45:08.401
-I need to stop.

514
00:45:12.927 --> 00:45:15.408
Abel. I want to stop.

515
00:45:15.451 --> 00:45:17.497
I need some water.

516
00:45:22.807 --> 00:45:25.505
-Hey!

517
00:45:25.548 --> 00:45:27.333
Come on. What the fuck?
This is bullshit.

518
00:45:27.376 --> 00:45:28.900
Nothing's happening.

519
00:45:30.553 --> 00:45:35.254
-Abel. I'm going to take
this off right fucking now.

520
00:45:35.297 --> 00:45:37.735
-God damn it. I'm not playing!

521
00:45:37.778 --> 00:45:40.172
I'm going to take this off!
What the fuck?!

522
00:45:45.307 --> 00:45:48.093
-I swear to God. Abel.
if you don't --

523
00:45:59.104 --> 00:46:00.975
-Yes.

524
00:46:01.019 --> 00:46:03.195
Oh! Oh!

525
00:46:03.238 --> 00:46:05.501
- Oh. God!
Oh. holy fuck!

526
00:46:05.545 --> 00:46:07.199
-Are you okay?
-Oh. Jesus!

527
00:46:07.242 --> 00:46:09.810
-Yes.
-What was that?!

528
00:46:09.854 --> 00:46:13.031
What was that?
I was floating.

529
00:46:13.074 --> 00:46:15.424
I was floating in the air!

530
00:46:15.468 --> 00:46:17.078
Oh. my God.
No. no. no. no. no.

531
00:46:17.122 --> 00:46:19.646
I felt it. I felt it.

532
00:46:19.689 --> 00:46:22.736
It was like an energy
in my chest.

533
00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:26.218
Oh. my God. This is real.

534
00:46:27.785 --> 00:46:30.657
I'm going to hold my baby again.

535
00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:34.095
I'm going to hold
my baby boy again!

536
00:47:06.388 --> 00:47:10.697
We seek to bring the dead
back to the living.

537
00:47:16.572 --> 00:47:21.316
-We seek to bring the dead
back to the living.

538
00:48:12.367 --> 00:48:14.369
-Has he come for you?

539
00:48:18.112 --> 00:48:22.769
-We say come. We say come.

540
00:48:29.167 --> 00:48:31.430
-It's fine. All right.
You're here with me.

541
00:48:31.473 --> 00:48:32.822
You're safe.
-No. I'm not safe.

542
00:48:32.866 --> 00:48:34.346
-Yes. you are.
-We are not safe.

543
00:48:34.389 --> 00:48:36.478
-Okay. look at me.
-Not safe. not safe.

544
00:48:36.522 --> 00:48:40.395
-Honey. just look at me.
There we go. It's okay.

545
00:48:40.439 --> 00:48:43.137
-It was like a daylight
just shut off.

546
00:48:43.181 --> 00:48:45.792
Like somebody flipped a switch.

547
00:48:47.141 --> 00:48:48.664
-Okay.
-No.

548
00:48:50.666 --> 00:48:51.841
Okay.

549
00:48:51.885 --> 00:48:54.409
-No. we have to go back.

550
00:48:54.453 --> 00:48:56.977
We have to go back.

551
00:48:57.021 --> 00:49:00.763
It was like we invited...

552
00:49:00.807 --> 00:49:05.986
There is an order. and we have
to follow the order.

553
00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:07.379
But...

554
00:49:07.422 --> 00:49:09.033
-But what?

555
00:49:19.173 --> 00:49:20.783
-No. Get the fuck out of here.

556
00:49:20.827 --> 00:49:22.394
-That's the first thing
you're going to say to me?

557
00:49:22.437 --> 00:49:24.178
-Hey. Wyatt. the restraining
order is still good.

558
00:49:24.222 --> 00:49:25.571
I renew it every fucking year.

559
00:49:25.614 --> 00:49:29.270
- God. Cora. come on.

560
00:49:29.314 --> 00:49:31.185
-Answer's still the same.
I got nothing for you. okay?

561
00:49:31.229 --> 00:49:33.535
I got no money. no nothing.
So get the fuck off my porch.

562
00:49:33.579 --> 00:49:36.190
-You don't even know
what I was here for.

563
00:49:36.234 --> 00:49:38.018
-All right. you know.
I'm going to call the cops.

564
00:49:38.062 --> 00:49:41.456
-Fuck. We both know your phone
don't work for shit out here.

565
00:49:45.504 --> 00:49:48.681
Holy shit. Cora.

566
00:49:48.724 --> 00:49:50.378
I thought he was
a church going girl.

567
00:49:50.422 --> 00:49:53.077
Clutched my pearls.

568
00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:54.426
Unless that's your daddy.

569
00:49:54.469 --> 00:49:55.775
-Okay. Abel. it's fine.
I got this.

570
00:49:55.818 --> 00:50:00.345
-Huh? Oh. your daddy
killed himself.

571
00:50:00.388 --> 00:50:03.304
Hey. man.

572
00:50:03.348 --> 00:50:05.567
Hey. don't I know you?

573
00:50:05.611 --> 00:50:08.048
-No. man.
I don't think you do.

574
00:50:08.092 --> 00:50:10.311
-No. yeah. Oh. shit. My bad.

575
00:50:10.355 --> 00:50:12.705
You -- your face
was all over my TV for

576
00:50:12.748 --> 00:50:14.054
I don't know how long. right?

577
00:50:14.098 --> 00:50:15.708
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Fuck it.

578
00:50:15.751 --> 00:50:18.754
Local celebrity pulling
that girl out of the gorge.

579
00:50:18.798 --> 00:50:21.061
-Hey. shut up! Shut the fuck up.
You can't be here.

580
00:50:21.105 --> 00:50:25.413
-I can be anywhere the fuck
I want to be. little lady.

581
00:50:25.457 --> 00:50:27.763
You fucking her. Abel. huh?

582
00:50:27.807 --> 00:50:31.550
Yeah? Are you able. Abel?

583
00:50:31.593 --> 00:50:33.378
-Okay. Well. she asked you
to leave. so...

584
00:50:33.421 --> 00:50:36.598
-You know what? It's okay.
Really. He's nothing.

585
00:50:36.642 --> 00:50:39.210
He's just a strung out
piece of shit.

586
00:50:39.253 --> 00:50:41.516
-Pot and kettle. Cora.

587
00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:44.606
-Pot and fucking kettle.

588
00:50:44.650 --> 00:50:50.003
Your. um. your new man friend.
he. uh.

589
00:50:50.047 --> 00:50:52.484
he really know you. like.
really know you?

590
00:50:52.527 --> 00:50:54.486
Like all those dicks
you sucked for dope.

591
00:50:54.529 --> 00:50:56.488
-Ah!
-Hey. Hey. man.

592
00:50:56.531 --> 00:50:58.229
-Hey. man!

593
00:51:06.367 --> 00:51:07.847
-What?

594
00:51:07.890 --> 00:51:09.327
What the fuck are you
going to do with that?

595
00:51:09.370 --> 00:51:11.068
-I'm going to take it
upside your fucking head

596
00:51:11.111 --> 00:51:13.026
if I have to
-Hey. no. Hey. Fuck.

597
00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:15.115
I'm going.

598
00:51:15.159 --> 00:51:17.335
You know. you two
deserve each other.

599
00:51:17.378 --> 00:51:19.815
We're fucking
Parents in the World Club.

600
00:51:19.859 --> 00:51:22.122
-Leave!
-I'm going!

601
00:51:22.166 --> 00:51:24.951
Man. you guys probably just.
like. holding each other

602
00:51:24.994 --> 00:51:26.822
after doing it.
and you're just like.

603
00:51:26.866 --> 00:51:29.608
"Oh. I'm the worst parent.
no. I'm the worst parent.

604
00:51:29.651 --> 00:51:31.436
No. baby. you did your best."

605
00:51:31.479 --> 00:51:34.221
And you're like. "Well. your
best ain't fucking good enough.

606
00:51:34.265 --> 00:51:35.831
Well. I lost my kid.

607
00:51:35.875 --> 00:51:38.486
My kid fell down
a fucking hole in the earth.

608
00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:40.532
How the fuck are you
going to deal with that?

609
00:51:40.575 --> 00:51:43.491
Well. I just gave up
on my fucking kid.

610
00:51:43.535 --> 00:51:45.102
Yeah. that's pretty bad.

611
00:51:45.145 --> 00:51:47.800
Well. you know. it's even worse.
I don't even..."

612
00:51:50.542 --> 00:51:52.674
-I'm really sorry. Abel.

613
00:51:55.982 --> 00:51:58.419
That is not your fault.

614
00:52:01.596 --> 00:52:05.687
That's really nice and all.
but. uh...

615
00:52:05.731 --> 00:52:09.865
I shouldn't let other people pay
for my shitty life choices.

616
00:52:09.909 --> 00:52:13.782
-Are you sure you're ready
to do this today?

617
00:52:13.826 --> 00:52:15.915
-What?

618
00:52:19.788 --> 00:52:23.401
Wyatt fucked up everything
good in my life.

619
00:52:23.444 --> 00:52:26.012
And he is not taking this
from me. too.

620
00:52:26.055 --> 00:52:31.191
-I can't come up with the words
to explain to you

621
00:52:31.235 --> 00:52:33.889
how difficult today will be.

622
00:52:35.369 --> 00:52:37.154
-We go on.

623
00:53:00.089 --> 00:53:03.049
-We come of our own accord.
and we do what we will.

624
00:53:03.092 --> 00:53:05.138
not what we are told.

625
00:53:05.182 --> 00:53:08.620
-We come of our own accord.
and we do what we will.

626
00:53:08.663 --> 00:53:11.536
not what we are told.

627
00:53:11.579 --> 00:53:13.494
-Today...

628
00:53:15.975 --> 00:53:19.326
...we ask for grief.

629
00:53:19.370 --> 00:53:22.721
-Today we ask for grief.

630
00:53:22.764 --> 00:53:27.204
-Grief of the highest order.

631
00:53:27.987 --> 00:53:30.990
-Grief of the highest order.

632
00:53:31.033 --> 00:53:34.211
-Remittance for that
we wish to receive.

633
00:53:34.254 --> 00:53:38.519
-Remittance for that
which we wish to receive.

634
00:58:52.964 --> 00:58:54.879
Shh!

635
00:58:56.358 --> 00:59:00.014
The rules. child.

636
00:59:01.059 --> 00:59:04.889
Lest this be

637
00:59:04.932 --> 00:59:09.241
your last memory of him.

638
00:59:36.442 --> 00:59:38.662
I wasn't drugged.

639
00:59:38.705 --> 00:59:42.579
I saw those places.
I was there.

640
00:59:48.846 --> 00:59:50.456
-Look. I...

641
00:59:50.499 --> 00:59:54.503
I'm trying really hard
to just sit here and listen.

642
00:59:54.547 --> 00:59:55.940
but it's really hard
with all the shit

643
00:59:55.983 --> 00:59:59.073
that we've been
through with your...

644
00:59:59.117 --> 01:00:02.294
-With my what?
Hey. with my what?

645
01:00:02.337 --> 01:00:03.861
-With your choices. Cora.

646
01:00:03.904 --> 01:00:06.646
With your piss poor
fucking choices.

647
01:00:08.039 --> 01:00:10.041
You run away
from everything. you know?

648
01:00:10.084 --> 01:00:11.999
You sabotage whatever
you can't run away from.

649
01:00:12.043 --> 01:00:13.522
You put every fucking chemical
you can find

650
01:00:13.566 --> 01:00:15.742
in your body. right?

651
01:00:15.786 --> 01:00:17.657
You know. I never even know
what's up or down with you.

652
01:00:17.701 --> 01:00:19.572
-Okay.
-Yeah.

653
01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:21.313
-Well. I'm sorry that
I could never live up

654
01:00:21.356 --> 01:00:22.880
to the golden child
bar that you set.

655
01:00:22.923 --> 01:00:26.057
-Oh. fuck.
-No way.

656
01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:27.667
What do you want me
to fucking say?

657
01:00:27.711 --> 01:00:31.062
And how many times do you
want me to fucking say it?

658
01:00:31.105 --> 01:00:32.672
-Why didn't you call me?

659
01:00:32.716 --> 01:00:35.414
-Oh. so you could tell me
that I was fucking crazy.

660
01:00:35.457 --> 01:00:37.068
that I was fucking using.

661
01:00:37.111 --> 01:00:39.679
or whatever the fuck
you wanted to say?

662
01:00:39.723 --> 01:00:44.249
That shit was real. It was real.

663
01:00:44.292 --> 01:00:47.861
And it was the only way.

664
01:00:47.905 --> 01:00:50.298
You weren't going to
bring him home.

665
01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:00.178
-Christ.

666
01:01:55.712 --> 01:01:56.930
-You got a minute?

667
01:01:56.974 --> 01:01:58.889
-Yeah. What's up?

668
01:02:01.805 --> 01:02:03.545
-What am I looking at?

669
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:06.244
-Autopsy of the Turner girl
pulled from the gorge last year.

670
01:02:06.287 --> 01:02:07.724
-Mm-hmm. Yeah. I recognize her.

671
01:02:07.767 --> 01:02:09.290
What's with the school
print out?

672
01:02:09.334 --> 01:02:11.771
-From Blanchard Middle School.

673
01:02:11.815 --> 01:02:13.860
In Boston.

674
01:02:13.904 --> 01:02:16.428
Taken last month.

675
01:02:31.791 --> 01:02:34.968
-You ready?

676
01:02:35.012 --> 01:02:36.840
-No.

677
01:02:40.452 --> 01:02:42.454
-How are these things
still here?

678
01:02:42.497 --> 01:02:45.370
-My mom had some kind
of sealer put on them.

679
01:02:45.413 --> 01:02:48.765
and I think they're starting
to show their age.

680
01:02:53.421 --> 01:02:55.641
-It's going to
show itself today.

681
01:02:58.992 --> 01:03:02.300
Remember. this is a barter.

682
01:03:02.343 --> 01:03:04.171
Not a gift.

683
01:03:08.175 --> 01:03:10.090
Stay in that circle.

684
01:03:10.134 --> 01:03:12.876
If you forget everything else.
remember that.

685
01:03:12.919 --> 01:03:15.356
Stay in.

686
01:03:17.141 --> 01:03:19.926
We're gonna be fine.

687
01:03:20.927 --> 01:03:23.277
We're almost there.

688
01:03:50.435 --> 01:03:53.830
We come of our own accord.

689
01:03:53.873 --> 01:03:56.789
-We come of our own accord.

690
01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:59.444
-Invitation has been extended.

691
01:03:59.487 --> 01:04:02.099
-Invitation has been extended.

692
01:04:03.317 --> 01:04:05.754
-Grief endured.

693
01:04:05.798 --> 01:04:08.105
-Grief endured.

694
01:04:17.418 --> 01:04:20.378
-We now author the symbols
of your arrival.

695
01:04:24.730 --> 01:04:27.864
-We now author the symbols
of your arrival.

696
01:05:26.052 --> 01:05:28.315
Come.

697
01:05:28.359 --> 01:05:30.056
Come to us now.

698
01:05:31.797 --> 01:05:33.538
-Come.

699
01:05:33.581 --> 01:05:36.584
Come to us now.

700
01:05:43.548 --> 01:05:46.812
-From black. from black.

701
01:10:26.439 --> 01:10:29.268
Abel?

702
01:10:58.210 --> 01:10:59.777
You...

703
01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:01.779
This...

704
01:12:24.688 --> 01:12:28.474
-Do you not wish to set eyes
on him again?

705
01:12:28.518 --> 01:12:33.914
To once more savor
his innocent scent?

706
01:12:33.958 --> 01:12:38.528
Your boy...Noah.

707
01:12:41.052 --> 01:12:42.880
-Yes.

708
01:12:42.923 --> 01:12:45.056
Yes. please.

709
01:12:48.407 --> 01:12:50.583
I'm so sorry.

710
01:12:51.323 --> 01:12:53.456
I'll do anything.

711
01:12:54.631 --> 01:12:59.549
-I know you will. child.
I know you will.

712
01:13:01.551 --> 01:13:03.596
Finish what you begun.

713
01:13:06.512 --> 01:13:08.384
-How?

714
01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:11.648
I'm all alone.

715
01:13:13.737 --> 01:13:16.696
-You have all you need.

716
01:14:01.219 --> 01:14:04.135
-Told you. Fucking goat.

717
01:14:11.969 --> 01:14:13.318
-Come on. Jones.

718
01:14:13.361 --> 01:14:15.276
It's okay.

719
01:14:16.452 --> 01:14:19.150
It's okay. Come on.

720
01:15:12.116 --> 01:15:13.770
-Come.

721
01:15:23.649 --> 01:15:25.608
-I've done everything.

722
01:15:26.347 --> 01:15:28.088
-Come.

723
01:15:31.004 --> 01:15:33.746
-When do I see him?

724
01:15:33.790 --> 01:15:35.531
-Come. child.

725
01:15:37.663 --> 01:15:39.404
To the circle.

726
01:15:41.711 --> 01:15:43.539
For the boy.

727
01:16:16.484 --> 01:16:18.182
-This is it. Cora.

728
01:16:19.444 --> 01:16:22.142
Day of payment.

729
01:16:22.186 --> 01:16:25.798
-Noah? Where's Noah?

730
01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:30.368
-Soon.

731
01:17:12.497 --> 01:17:14.499
-I'm so sorry. Abel.

732
01:17:18.416 --> 01:17:21.027
-Plate.

733
01:17:21.071 --> 01:17:22.507
-What is this?

734
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:24.509
-It's just goat.

735
01:17:25.249 --> 01:17:27.947
-No. I want to see Noah.

736
01:17:29.514 --> 01:17:33.039
-Plate!

737
01:17:38.654 --> 01:17:40.264
Fuck!

738
01:17:50.448 --> 01:17:53.625
Now. first is for flesh.

739
01:17:54.321 --> 01:17:58.282
The second. blood.

740
01:17:58.325 --> 01:18:02.112
The third. bone.

741
01:18:07.683 --> 01:18:08.945
Eat.

742
01:18:08.988 --> 01:18:11.774
-What?
-Eat.

743
01:18:11.817 --> 01:18:16.735
So that Noah's flesh. blood.
and bone can be made whole.

744
01:18:28.791 --> 01:18:30.575
Ah...

745
01:18:48.245 --> 01:18:50.769
-I gave my payment
for the gift of life.

746
01:18:50.813 --> 01:18:54.381
I carried the secret
in exchange for my daughter.

747
01:18:56.209 --> 01:18:58.603
He brought back to the living.

748
01:19:03.956 --> 01:19:07.220
And though I did not
see her again.

749
01:19:07.264 --> 01:19:10.963
I consider my payment
just and fair.

750
01:19:24.629 --> 01:19:26.326
-I don't --
-This is the last step. Cora.

751
01:19:26.370 --> 01:19:29.982
Drink so the rite is complete.

752
01:19:30.026 --> 01:19:31.592
-When do I see him?

753
01:19:31.636 --> 01:19:34.204
-I don't know.

754
01:19:34.247 --> 01:19:40.384
I know that if you drink. Noah
will be alive in the flesh.

755
01:19:40.427 --> 01:19:42.386
That's the accord.

756
01:19:47.434 --> 01:19:49.132
Drink it.

757
01:20:10.588 --> 01:20:12.198
-No!

758
01:20:13.591 --> 01:20:15.245
-Oh. no.

759
01:20:20.511 --> 01:20:25.995
-The woman who bestowed this
gift upon me paid her price!

760
01:20:26.038 --> 01:20:27.823
And I paid mine!

761
01:20:30.086 --> 01:20:34.525
As have countless souls
through millennia.

762
01:20:34.568 --> 01:20:39.791
You made clear this was worth
the toll. so pay yours.

763
01:20:41.967 --> 01:20:45.144
You must carry the --

764
01:20:45.188 --> 01:20:47.625
Shh.

765
01:20:47.668 --> 01:20:50.758
You must carry the seeker to
the next soul who needs it.

766
01:20:50.802 --> 01:20:53.587
It is the way.

767
01:20:53.631 --> 01:20:56.286
It's the only way!

768
01:20:56.329 --> 01:20:58.636
-Jesus Christ.

769
01:21:00.812 --> 01:21:02.770
Did you groom me?

770
01:21:02.814 --> 01:21:06.122
-Fuck you.
-In the group. In the group.

771
01:21:06.165 --> 01:21:08.080
Were you just looking
for somebody to pass this

772
01:21:08.124 --> 01:21:10.387
thing on to?

773
01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:12.389
Were you?!

774
01:21:24.270 --> 01:21:26.359
-You've ruined everything.

775
01:21:30.146 --> 01:21:32.104
I offered you rebirth.

776
01:21:34.454 --> 01:21:36.804
This is a divine gift.

777
01:21:36.848 --> 01:21:40.765
In return. you took
everything from me.

778
01:21:42.898 --> 01:21:47.293
You robbed me of ever seeing
my little baby girl again

779
01:21:47.337 --> 01:21:52.908
because you can't follow
simple fucking instructions.

780
01:21:55.345 --> 01:21:58.696
You fucking deserve this now!

781
01:22:01.220 --> 01:22:03.222
Drink!

782
01:22:05.268 --> 01:22:07.487
Drink it!

783
01:22:11.404 --> 01:22:14.233
-Fuck you.

784
01:22:18.150 --> 01:22:21.240
-No-o-o-o-o-o!

785
01:22:31.903 --> 01:22:35.646
I am owed.

786
01:22:36.212 --> 01:22:39.432
I will take back the prize.

787
01:22:40.564 --> 01:22:42.958
-No.
-The boy one was suffering

788
01:22:43.001 --> 01:22:44.655
without end.

789
01:22:44.698 --> 01:22:48.137
He will know nothing but pain
and sorrow and despair

790
01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:51.183
till the end of all things.

791
01:22:51.792 --> 01:22:54.926
- No. Please.

792
01:22:57.798 --> 01:23:00.105
You can't.

793
01:23:01.106 --> 01:23:03.108
-But I can.

794
01:23:06.416 --> 01:23:08.853
-There must be something.

795
01:23:08.896 --> 01:23:11.203
-I must have a vessel.

796
01:23:11.247 --> 01:23:13.249
The payment is clear.

797
01:23:13.292 --> 01:23:16.426
That is the way.

798
01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:19.211
-I can get you a vessel.

799
01:23:19.864 --> 01:23:22.040
I can.

800
01:23:22.084 --> 01:23:26.305
-No games. girl.

801
01:23:29.091 --> 01:23:32.007
-No games. I can.

802
01:23:33.878 --> 01:23:35.706
I can.

803
01:23:44.106 --> 01:23:47.065
Hey.

804
01:23:47.109 --> 01:23:49.198
Yeah. I know.

805
01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:54.855
I really need
to see you tonight.

806
01:23:54.899 --> 01:23:58.250
No. no. no. Tonight.

807
01:23:58.294 --> 01:24:00.209
Can you score?

808
01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:05.083
Yeah. Yeah.

809
01:24:05.127 --> 01:24:06.737
Hey.

810
01:24:08.565 --> 01:24:10.306
Hurry.

811
01:24:38.508 --> 01:24:40.423
-Sweet pea?

812
01:24:44.862 --> 01:24:46.559
Sweetie pie?

813
01:25:02.706 --> 01:25:04.577
The fuck?

814
01:25:18.243 --> 01:25:21.638
Ooh. peek-a-boo.

815
01:25:21.681 --> 01:25:23.683
I see you.

816
01:25:25.337 --> 01:25:27.818
Hey.

817
01:25:27.861 --> 01:25:29.515
I got your shit.

818
01:25:31.256 --> 01:25:33.606
And you still got
your clothes on.

819
01:25:36.479 --> 01:25:38.611
Dope ain't free. Cora.

820
01:26:05.203 --> 01:26:07.727
-What is this. girl?

821
01:26:11.383 --> 01:26:14.473
-I gave you...

822
01:26:14.517 --> 01:26:17.520
-This vessel is tainted.

823
01:26:21.959 --> 01:26:24.744
Unclean.

824
01:28:16.334 --> 01:28:18.945
-911. What's your emergency?

825
01:28:33.438 --> 01:28:35.701
-Um...

826
01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:39.226
Let's. uh --
Let's get her cleaned up.

827
01:28:47.060 --> 01:28:49.193
We're going to get you a shower.

828
01:28:49.236 --> 01:28:50.934
-And then what?
-And then I'm going

829
01:28:50.977 --> 01:28:52.457
to bring you over to Holding
until we can get

830
01:28:52.501 --> 01:28:53.676
all this figured out.

831
01:28:53.719 --> 01:28:55.025
-What's Holding?
-It's quiet there.

832
01:28:55.068 --> 01:28:57.070
Nobody's going to bother you.
-No.

833
01:28:57.114 --> 01:28:59.551
No. no. no. no. no.
I can't be alone.

834
01:28:59.595 --> 01:29:01.814
Please.
You can't leave me alone.

835
01:29:01.858 --> 01:29:03.163
-We're going to need
to revisit all this

836
01:29:03.207 --> 01:29:04.382
after you get
a little bit of rest.

837
01:29:04.426 --> 01:29:06.341
-No. Hey. Hey.

838
01:29:06.384 --> 01:29:08.386
Get your fucking hands off me!

839
01:29:08.430 --> 01:29:09.692
What the fuck?!

840
01:29:09.735 --> 01:29:11.171
-Hey. hey. hey. hey.
hey. hey. hey.

841
01:29:11.215 --> 01:29:13.652
This is not helping.
You need to calm down.

842
01:29:15.567 --> 01:29:17.874
Can you do that? Huh?

843
01:29:20.442 --> 01:29:25.534
I'm going to do everything I can
to figure all this out. okay?

844
01:29:25.577 --> 01:29:27.753
-You owe me that. Allison.

845
01:29:27.797 --> 01:29:32.845
You know me.
You know me. Not her.

846
01:29:32.889 --> 01:29:36.153
-Okay. She'll stay here.
Just you and me.

847
01:29:36.196 --> 01:29:38.416
Okay?

848
01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:40.200
Come on.

849
01:29:54.998 --> 01:29:57.174
-Thanks.
-Mm-hmm.

850
01:29:57.217 --> 01:29:58.828
-Hey.

851
01:29:58.871 --> 01:30:00.569
Did her urine come back yet?

852
01:30:00.612 --> 01:30:02.701
-Yeah. she's clean.
Nothing on board.

853
01:30:02.745 --> 01:30:04.094
-And Wyatt?

854
01:30:04.137 --> 01:30:05.835
-Just got off the phone
with his P.O.

855
01:30:05.878 --> 01:30:08.751
Said he's been MIA for weeks.
There's an active warrant.

856
01:30:08.794 --> 01:30:11.449
-Hm.
-Do you think she did him?

857
01:30:11.493 --> 01:30:13.190
-No body. no murder.

858
01:30:13.233 --> 01:30:16.498
But she's washing somebody's
blood off her in there.

859
01:30:16.541 --> 01:30:18.717
No way to know
till the labs come back.

860
01:30:40.478 --> 01:30:43.873
-You're not going to find him.
He's gone.

861
01:30:43.916 --> 01:30:45.570
It took him.

862
01:30:45.614 --> 01:30:47.703
-Okay. Okay.

863
01:30:48.921 --> 01:30:51.010
-You got to believe me.

864
01:30:56.015 --> 01:30:57.364
-Just give me a little bit
of time

865
01:30:57.408 --> 01:30:59.889
to figure all this out. okay?

866
01:31:01.064 --> 01:31:03.370
We really are in this together.

867
01:31:05.895 --> 01:31:07.592
-Don't leave.
-Door.

868
01:31:07.636 --> 01:31:09.507
-I won't be long.

869
01:31:09.551 --> 01:31:11.683
-You can't leave me
in this fucking place. Allison!

870
01:31:11.727 --> 01:31:12.945
I mean. what the fuck?!

871
01:31:12.989 --> 01:31:14.207
-You are safe in here. Okay?

872
01:31:14.251 --> 01:31:16.383
This is just how it has to be.

873
01:31:16.427 --> 01:31:19.517
-Didn't you hear
a fucking word that I just said?

874
01:31:19.561 --> 01:31:22.564
You cannot leave me
in here alone.

875
01:31:22.607 --> 01:31:24.914
That thing is coming from me.

876
01:31:26.219 --> 01:31:28.395
It's like I let it out.

877
01:31:28.439 --> 01:31:32.138
Allison. I fucked the whole
thing up. and I let it out.

878
01:31:32.182 --> 01:31:35.881
-I'm not going to let anything
bad happen to you. I promise.

879
01:31:35.925 --> 01:31:38.449
-Just try to get some sleep.

880
01:31:38.493 --> 01:31:40.582
I'll be back soon.

881
01:31:40.625 --> 01:31:43.236
I will.

882
01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:46.326
Allison! Allison. no!

883
01:31:47.937 --> 01:31:49.982
It wants me to carry it!

884
01:31:50.026 --> 01:31:53.769
Allison. please!

885
01:31:53.812 --> 01:31:56.511
Allison!

886
01:32:04.388 --> 01:32:05.868
I'm so sorry.

887
01:32:05.911 --> 01:32:08.087
I tried.

888
01:32:08.131 --> 01:32:10.046
Please don't come.

889
01:32:10.437 --> 01:32:14.137
Please. Please don't come.
I'm so sorry. I tried.

890
01:32:23.102 --> 01:32:25.670
Hello?

891
01:32:25.714 --> 01:32:28.717
Anybody?

892
01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:32.459
God damn it!
Can somebody help me?

893
01:32:32.503 --> 01:32:35.593
Hi. Hi. um...hi.

894
01:32:35.637 --> 01:32:39.118
I need. um --

895
01:32:42.644 --> 01:32:46.778
Do you happen to know if Allison
is coming back soon?

896
01:32:46.822 --> 01:32:50.608
Do you think that
I could get your help?

897
01:32:50.652 --> 01:32:53.480
-You hurt?

898
01:32:53.524 --> 01:32:55.221
-No.
-Need the restroom?

899
01:32:55.265 --> 01:32:58.660
-I think that there might
be something in here with me.

900
01:32:59.661 --> 01:33:02.925
And I need your help.

901
01:33:05.362 --> 01:33:07.494
Please.

902
01:33:11.020 --> 01:33:13.196

01:33:26.209 --> 01:33:28.690
Let us reason.

909
01:33:45.402 --> 01:33:47.143
Please!

910
01:34:48.378 --> 01:34:53.644
-You hold the blood so that
I may be made of flesh.

911
01:34:53.688 --> 01:34:58.083
You endured grief.

912
01:34:58.127 --> 01:35:02.261
Sweet. sweet grief.

913
01:35:06.222 --> 01:35:10.530
Lest we forget. pain.

914
01:35:13.795 --> 01:35:18.190
Let not regret also take
residence within you.

915
01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:25.850
Does not a boy need its mother?

916
01:35:35.251 --> 01:35:38.776
We've come to the end. child.

917
01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:41.910
No sanctuary to be had.

918
01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:47.393
Payment is all that remains.

919
01:35:49.961 --> 01:35:53.008
Take me in.

920
01:35:53.051 --> 01:35:58.491
Deliver me to a broken soul.

921
01:36:04.671 --> 01:36:07.065
The boy...

922
01:36:09.633 --> 01:36:11.983
...calls to you.

923
01:36:30.045 --> 01:36:33.483
-Found you. Mr. Magoo.

924
01:37:10.433 --> 01:37:12.435
-Boo!
