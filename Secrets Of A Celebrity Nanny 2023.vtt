Hey. kiddo. Time for bed.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.667
Mom's gonna be home
in the morning.

00:00:47.792 --> 00:00:49.333
Finally.

10
00:00:49.417 --> 00:00:51.917
Hey. You know you're the reason
she works so hard. right?

11
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.750
I just wish she were here more.

12
00:00:53.833 --> 00:00:55.875
Mm. give her a break.

13
00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.042
She works so hard
and stays so busy

14
00:00:58.042 --> 00:01:00.667
so that you can have
everything you want.

15
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.542
Everything she didn't
have when she was a kid.

16

21
00:01:13.125 --> 00:01:16.500
Thanks. Mia. You're
the best nanny.

22
00:01:16.625 --> 00:01:18.417

00:04:06.625 --> 00:04:07.667
She should come across as--

[cellphone rings]

47
00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:11.708

52
00:04:18.292 --> 00:04:19.250
I know.

53
00:04:19.333 --> 00:04:20.667
It's the agency.

54
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.583
[Gabby] I know.

55
00:04:23.708 --> 00:04:24.375
They've been
calling all morning.

56
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.583
Ooh.

57
00:04:25.667 --> 00:04:27.125
Maybe you should pick it up.

58
00:04:27.208 --> 00:04:28.667
I can't take another nanny job.

59
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.333
or I'll never get
my book published.

60
00:04:30.458 --> 00:04:33.208
But rent is due. and one
of us needs to be employed.

61
00:04:33.292 --> 00:04:35.292
No go on yesterday's callback?

62
00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:38.292
[sighs] Apparently. I'm
a very talented actress.

63
00:04:38.375 --> 00:04:42.000
just not dynamic enough.
or desperate enough?

64
00:04:42.042 --> 00:04:43.625
I know it started with a D.

65
00:04:43.625 --> 00:04:45.333
Well. at least you
hear something back.

66
00:04:45.458 --> 00:04:48.375
I've sent 47 query letters.
and all I get is silence.

67
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.458
Someone will publish your
book. but until they do.

68
00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:53.333
what are we gonna
do about money?

69
00:04:53.417 --> 00:04:54.458
Maybe I'll see if there's
any available shifts

70
00:04:54.542 --> 00:04:55.625
at the Caffeine Hut.

71
00:04:55.708 --> 00:04:57.792
Uh-uh-uh. You're too talented.

72
00:04:57.875 --> 00:04:59.083
As a writer or a nanny?

73
00:04:59.208 --> 00:05:00.500
Both.

74
00:05:00.583 --> 00:05:02.125
Mm.

75
00:05:02.208 --> 00:05:05.667
Uh. Gabs. don't you
know Justice Grayce?

76
00:05:06.875 --> 00:05:08.167
I used to.

[reporters clamor]

78
00:05:14.542 --> 00:05:16.583
[Gabby] She and my mom were
friends when they were young.

79
00:05:16.708 --> 00:05:17.667
but that was before she--

80
00:05:17.792 --> 00:05:20.250
Shut up.

81
00:05:20.333 --> 00:05:22.375
She's right outside.

82
00:05:22.458 --> 00:05:23.792
Ha ha. very funny.

Gabriella. hi.

90
00:05:49.208 --> 00:05:50.667
I don't know if you remember me.

91
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:51.917
I was friends with your mom.

92
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.167
Yes. Um. yes. of course
I know who you are.

93
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.708
Can I come in for a minute?

94
00:05:56.792 --> 00:05:59.417
In here? In my house? You
want to come into my--

95
00:05:59.542 --> 00:06:00.625
[Hannah's arm thuds]

96
00:06:00.708 --> 00:06:02.292
[Hannah] Yes. yes. Come in.

97
00:06:02.375 --> 00:06:03.708
Thank you.

98
00:06:03.708 --> 00:06:05.583
[Hannah] Jay Gray or
Miss Gray or Queen?

99
00:06:05.667 --> 00:06:07.000
I don't know what to call you.

100
00:06:07.167 --> 00:06:08.458
Justice is fine.

101
00:06:08.542 --> 00:06:10.500
I'm gonna shut up now.

102
00:06:10.583 --> 00:06:14.417
Wow. this is so cute. You
have your mother's style.

103
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:15.708
Come on. have a seat.

104
00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:16.583
Thank you.

105
00:06:17.458 --> 00:06:18.750
[Gabby] Watch your step.

106
00:06:20.542 --> 00:06:22.208
Can I ask why you're here?
I'm not trying to be rude.

107
00:06:22.292 --> 00:06:23.000
- Oh--
- This is just so

108
00:06:23.042 --> 00:06:23.833
outta the blue.

109
00:06:23.875 --> 00:06:25.167
No. no. no. don't worry.

110
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.375
I just showed up
on your doorstep.

111
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.708
But I figured if
I came in person.

112
00:06:28.792 --> 00:06:30.833
you might not be able to say no.

113
00:06:30.917 --> 00:06:31.750
Say no to what?

114
00:06:34.417 --> 00:06:37.750
You know. I'm. I'm just
gonna go and weave a basket

115
00:06:37.833 --> 00:06:38.708
or something.

116
00:06:38.792 --> 00:06:40.167
It was really nice meeting you.

117
00:06:40.208 --> 00:06:41.042
You too.

118
00:06:43.167 --> 00:06:45.583
I'm sure you've heard the
story about my last nanny.

119
00:06:45.708 --> 00:06:48.292
I actually don't really keep
up with that sort of stuff.

120
00:06:48.375 --> 00:06:49.875
That's okay.

121
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.750
Apparently she was stealing
from me. including my alcohol.

122
00:06:51.833 --> 00:06:56.208
and then there was an accident
and she drowned in my pool.

123
00:06:56.333 --> 00:06:58.083
That's horrible. I'm so sorry.

124
00:06:58.167 --> 00:07:02.375
Yeah. since then there's been
a lot of media attention.

125
00:07:02.458 --> 00:07:04.667
none of it positive.
and it's scaring away

126
00:07:04.792 --> 00:07:06.542
all the potential nannies.

127
00:07:06.625 --> 00:07:08.875
Right when my daughter.
Willow. just turned 13.

128
00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.792
And I mean. she's an amazing
kid. the most amazing kid.

129
00:07:11.875 --> 00:07:14.750
But. you know. she can be a
bit of a handful. like her mom.

130
00:07:14.833 --> 00:07:16.625
[Gabby chuckles]

131
00:07:16.708 --> 00:07:20.042
You know. before she passed.
your mom mentioned you babysit.

132
00:07:20.125 --> 00:07:22.208
And then I was going through
the list at the nannies agency.

133
00:07:22.292 --> 00:07:24.000
and then I saw your name.

134
00:07:24.083 --> 00:07:26.667
After all these years. I was
like. "This must be fate."

135
00:07:26.708 --> 00:07:30.667
So. I was wondering if maybe
you would wanna take the job?

136
00:07:32.208 --> 00:07:34.833
Wow. You want me
to nanny for you?

137
00:07:34.875 --> 00:07:36.917
Yeah. I need
someone I can trust.

138
00:07:37.042 --> 00:07:39.167
Someone I know will
be good with Willow.

139
00:07:39.208 --> 00:07:40.625
someone who's discreet.

140
00:07:40.708 --> 00:07:42.667
I'm really trying to start
a career as a writer.

141
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.292
so. I'm sort of getting
out of the nanny business.

142
00:07:45.292 --> 00:07:47.167
A writer. Really?

143
00:07:48.625 --> 00:07:52.000
Oh. My ex-husband. he's
a. he's a publisher.

144
00:07:52.083 --> 00:07:53.667
So. I know how hard that is.

145
00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.333
You know. this was stupid.

146
00:07:57.375 --> 00:07:58.958
Your mom would be
so proud of you.

147
00:08:00.375 --> 00:08:01.792
I'm so sorry for the commotion.

148
00:08:03.667 --> 00:08:04.708
[Gabby] Justice. wait.

149
00:08:07.542 --> 00:08:09.292
[Gabby sighs]

150
00:08:09.375 --> 00:08:10.542
Come to think of it.

151
00:08:10.667 --> 00:08:12.208
I could actually really
use a job right now.

152
00:08:12.292 --> 00:08:12.833
Really?

153
00:08:14.375 --> 00:08:17.875
That would be so great.
Really? Oh. amazing.

154
00:08:19.375 --> 00:08:21.292
Can you get your stuff
so we can head out?

155
00:08:21.375 --> 00:08:22.500
You wanna go right now?

156
00:08:22.583 --> 00:08:24.500
I have a huge red
carpet event tonight.

157
00:08:24.542 --> 00:08:26.208
and I really need help.

158
00:08:26.208 --> 00:08:28.708
You'll meet Willow. and
both of you could come.

159
00:08:28.792 --> 00:08:29.583
She's gonna love you.

160
00:08:29.708 --> 00:08:32.125
Ah. I don't know what to say.

161
00:08:32.208 --> 00:08:33.958
Just say yes.

162
00:08:35.208 --> 00:08:36.083
Okay. Yes.

163
00:08:36.208 --> 00:08:37.125
- Yes?
- Yes.

164
00:08:37.208 --> 00:08:38.458
Great.

165
00:08:38.542 --> 00:08:39.208
Oh my god.

171

Miss Grayce. you
have to let me know

172
00:09:44.458 --> 00:09:45.917
when you leave the property.

173
00:09:46.042 --> 00:09:47.458
- [Justice] I know. - [Vernon]
Jay. we're gonna be so late.

174
00:09:47.458 --> 00:09:48.542
If there's one thing
we cannot be right now.

175
00:09:48.625 --> 00:09:49.417
it's so late.
- [Justice] I know. I know.

176
00:09:49.542 --> 00:09:50.333
I know. but this was important.

177
00:09:50.333 --> 00:09:51.250
Oh. this was important?

178
00:09:51.333 --> 00:09:52.458
No. what's important is tonight.

179
00:09:52.542 --> 00:09:53.667
Okay? What's important
is you being ready.

180
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:55.208
What's important is

a high-profile client.

[Ian]It was no big deal.

414
00:22:12.375 --> 00:22:13.167
It's not a big deal.
- [Justice] It is a big deal.

415
00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:14.417
No. it's not.

416
00:22:14.417 --> 00:22:16.833
On stage. really?
Without letting me know?

417
00:22:16.917 --> 00:22:18.500
You're just being a
drama queen about it.

418
00:22:18.542 --> 00:22:19.458
This is what we signed up for.
- Drama queen?

419
00:22:19.542 --> 00:22:20.333

420
00:22:20.417 --> 00:22:21.833
a drama queen?
- Yes.

421
00:22:21.917 --> 00:22:22.458
I'm calling you a drama queen.

422
00:22:22.583 --> 00:22:23.458

423
00:22:23.542 --> 00:22:25.125

Thanks for another great night!

428
00:22:31.583 --> 00:22:32.958
Honey. Honey. please don't.

429
00:22:33.042 --> 00:22:34.042
You did that.

430
00:22:34.125 --> 00:22:34.833
Oh god.

431
00:22:36.958 --> 00:22:40.167
[sighs] I'm so sorry this
had to be your first night.

432
00:22:40.208 --> 00:22:43.042
It was brilliant.
Don't be so glum. love.

433
00:22:43.167 --> 00:22:44.417
I need a drink.

434
00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:46.000
[Ian] Yeah. I was
thinking the same thing.

435
00:22:46.042 --> 00:22:47.333
[Justice] Oh. of course you
were thinking the same thing.

436
00:22:47.417 --> 00:22:48.792
[Ian] Of course I was
thinking the same thing.

437
00:22:50.083 --> 00:22:51.417
Welcome to my world.

438
00:22:52.792 --> 00:22:53.750
I understand you
wanna be a writer.

439
00:22:53.875 --> 00:22:56.500
You are not gonna
write about this.

440
00:22:56.542 --> 00:22:58.083
[Ian] She's
overreacting about this.

441
00:22:58.167 --> 00:22:59.500
[Justice] Overreacting?

442
00:22:59.583 --> 00:23:00.792
- [Ian] Yeah. you are.
- [Justice] It's just the fact

443
00:23:00.875 --> 00:23:02.208
that your guys didn't
share it with me--

444
00:23:02.333 --> 00:23:03.208
[Ian] I don't care anymore.

445
00:23:03.333 --> 00:23:04.250
I stopped listening--

446
00:23:04.333 --> 00:23:05.792
You can't just

447
00:23:05.875 --> 00:23:06.417
go and do that.
- [Ian] Blah. blah. blah.

448
00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.000
I do what I want.

449
00:23:08.042 --> 00:23:10.667
Look. I know you had
problems with the last nanny.

450
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:13.333
but I take this job just
as seriously as you do.

451
00:23:13.417 --> 00:23:16.292
Justice came to me and she
asked for my discretion.

452
00:23:16.375 --> 00:23:17.167
and I'm going to give it to her.

453
00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:19.833
Hm. Well make sure you do.

454
00:23:21.667 --> 00:23:22.875
Who was that man tonight?

455
00:23:23.958 --> 00:23:25.083
You seemed to know him?

456
00:23:25.167 --> 00:23:26.625
[Damian] You mean Isaac?

457
00:23:26.708 --> 00:23:29.750
Nut job fan. One of many.

458
00:23:29.875 --> 00:23:32.542
Thinks that he knows
her. but he's harmless.

459
00:23:32.667 --> 00:23:34.292
We got a restraining
order against him.

460
00:23:34.375 --> 00:23:36.000
We notified the police
that he violated it.

461
00:23:36.042 --> 00:23:37.500
and they'll let us know if
he's any more of a threat.

462
00:23:37.542 --> 00:23:39.708
I got this under control.

463
00:23:39.792 --> 00:23:43.208
I just wanna give you a little
bit of advice. if I can.

464
00:23:43.208 --> 00:23:45.917
I want you to keep your
head down. your mouth shut.

465
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.292
and I want you to
focus on Willow. okay?

466
00:23:48.375 --> 00:23:49.375
Okay.

467
00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:50.708
Here's your phone back.

468
00:23:50.792 --> 00:23:51.667
Thanks.

469
00:23:52.667 --> 00:23:55.792
[slow somber music]

470
00:24:01.625 --> 00:24:03.167
[Rhodes] It's good
to see you again.

471
00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:04.417
[Damian] It's good to see you.

472
00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:05.333
[Rhodes] Yeah. I'm
sorry it's under

473
00:24:05.417 --> 00:24:06.083
these circumstances though.

474
00:24:06.167 --> 00:24:07.667
[Damian] I'm sorry too.

475
00:24:07.708 --> 00:24:08.583
I. I just. Rhodes. I just
want you to understand

476
00:24:08.667 --> 00:24:09.958
that I got this under control.

477
00:24:10.042 --> 00:24:11.708
I don't wanna make
this a thing. okay?

478
00:24:11.792 --> 00:24:14.458
[Rhodes] [sighs] Dee.
it's already a thing.

479
00:24:14.542 --> 00:24:17.542
I'm doing you a favor
and I'm gonna walk away.

480
00:24:17.667 --> 00:24:20.000
But you gotta understand.
if this keeps happening.

481
00:24:20.083 --> 00:24:21.500
I'm gonna have to do my job.

482
00:24:21.583 --> 00:24:23.333
I understand. Rhodes. I
just. I want you to trust me.

483
00:24:23.375 --> 00:24:25.667
Understand that
I got this. okay?

484
00:24:25.708 --> 00:24:27.167
Okay.

485
00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:28.208
[scary banging]

486
00:24:28.292 --> 00:24:30.000
Sorry. I was just--

487
00:24:30.042 --> 00:24:33.000
Eavesdropping? Don't worry.
I won't tell anybody.

488
00:24:33.042 --> 00:24:34.417
You must be the new nanny.

489
00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:35.958
I'm the ex-husband. Hudson.

490
00:24:36.042 --> 00:24:37.667
I'm Gabby.

491
00:24:37.708 --> 00:24:38.875
Nice to meet you.

492
00:24:38.958 --> 00:24:40.500
[Hudson] Gabby. yeah.
Justice told me.

493
00:24:40.625 --> 00:24:41.708
I'm gonna trust you.

494
00:24:43.083 --> 00:24:44.042
You take care. man.

495
00:24:45.542 --> 00:24:46.792
[Hudson] She said that
you were a writer.

496
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:49.667
I happen to be a publisher.

497
00:24:49.667 --> 00:24:51.500
Yeah. Justice told me.

498
00:24:51.542 --> 00:24:53.125
You any good?

499
00:24:53.208 --> 00:24:53.833
I think so.

500
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.167
Yes. Yes. I am good.

501
00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:58.417
That's what I like to hear.

502
00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:00.375
Confidence makes a good writer.

503
00:25:00.458 --> 00:25:01.458
I think I should know.

504
00:25:02.833 --> 00:25:03.958
Maybe you could give me
something you're writing

505
00:25:04.042 --> 00:25:05.167
and I could see what
I can do with it.

506
00:25:05.208 --> 00:25:08.000
You would do that? Why?

507
00:25:08.083 --> 00:25:09.667
You're taking care
of my daughter.

508
00:25:09.708 --> 00:25:11.333
Figured if she likes you
and you stick around.

509
00:25:11.417 --> 00:25:13.083
then. I could return the favor.

510
00:25:15.375 --> 00:25:16.708
Thanks.

511
00:25:16.792 --> 00:25:17.583
Speaking of taking
care of my daughter.

512
00:25:17.708 --> 00:25:18.708
it's mother of the year.

513
00:25:18.833 --> 00:25:21.000
Hudson. what are you doing here?

514
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.667
Well. when I hear the news
that my daughter was at a bar

515
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:26.875
in the middle of the night
where my ex-wife was attacked.

516
00:25:26.875 --> 00:25:28.417
I thought I needed to check
and make sure she's okay.

517
00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.000
It wasn't like that.

518
00:25:30.042 --> 00:25:32.917
I wasn't attacked. and it
was a special occasion.

519
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.375
[Hudson] Yeah. I
read about that.

520
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:35.667
Congratulations on
your new marriage.

521
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:38.500
I hope this one works
out for you. Justice.

522
00:25:38.583 --> 00:25:40.792
Look. I didn't know he was
gonna propose like that.

523
00:25:40.875 --> 00:25:42.125
[Hudson] Yeah. you
could've fooled me.

524
00:25:44.542 --> 00:25:45.708
Well. now that I see
that everyone's okay.

525
00:25:45.875 --> 00:25:47.958
I will be back to pick up
Willow for the weekend.

526
00:25:49.417 --> 00:25:51.000
Hudson--

527
00:25:51.125 --> 00:25:52.917
I don't want her at any more
of your Hollywood parties.

528
00:25:56.333 --> 00:25:56.917
Hudson.

529
00:25:58.042 --> 00:25:58.875
Hudson.

530
00:26:03.042 --> 00:26:04.667
That was my ex-husband.

531
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:05.875
Huge pain in my ass.

532
00:26:07.417 --> 00:26:10.000
I used to love that
son of a bitch.

533
00:26:10.083 --> 00:26:12.167
and I know he cares
a lot about us.

534
00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:13.750
which is what drives me crazy.

535
00:26:13.833 --> 00:26:14.667
Mm.

536
00:26:15.625 --> 00:26:16.875
But what about Ian?

537
00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:23.042
Ian's. Ian's hot. he's young.
He's good for my career.

538
00:26:24.583 --> 00:26:26.167
But you don't love him?

539
00:26:26.208 --> 00:26:29.750
Love. love. Let's just say
we have an understanding.

540
00:26:29.833 --> 00:26:33.417
Like me. Hudson did not know I
was getting engaged on stage.

541
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.875
Of course the fans wanna see
you two get married. Okay?

542
00:26:35.958 --> 00:26:37.417
- Well. yeah. the prob--
- The press eating this up.

543
00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:38.375
Blah. blah. blah. blah.

544
00:26:38.458 --> 00:26:39.875
You're all over the tabloids.

545
00:26:39.958 --> 00:26:41.167
Yeah. well so. we can do
something in private then. yeah?

546
00:26:41.208 --> 00:26:44.083
This is insane. We don't
even have the same fans.

547
00:26:44.167 --> 00:26:45.833
And why would we do
something in private

548
00:26:45.875 --> 00:26:48.167
if we're doing it for
the public anyway. right?

549
00:26:48.208 --> 00:26:51.417
New fans is exactly the
idea. for both of you.

550
00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:53.792
They'd like to see you guys
together. more for everyone.

551
00:26:53.875 --> 00:26:55.333
Okay. Just picture it.

552
00:26:55.417 --> 00:26:56.542
We'll start off
with the classics.

553
00:26:56.625 --> 00:26:57.708
and then we can
go to the new song

554
00:26:57.792 --> 00:26:58.542
you just made.
- Yeah. yeah. whatever.

555
00:26:58.667 --> 00:26:59.833
We'll figure it out.

556
00:26:59.875 --> 00:27:03.000
But please. both of
you. no more surprises.

557
00:27:03.042 --> 00:27:04.542
It's all part of the
plan. sweetheart.

558
00:27:04.625 --> 00:27:06.750
Come on. you gotta
trust me on this. Mm-ah.

559
00:27:06.833 --> 00:27:09.250
Whatever. Just. out.
Leave. all of you.

560
00:27:11.042 --> 00:27:11.875
Not you.

561
00:27:14.542 --> 00:27:15.333
[Gabby sighs]

562
00:27:15.375 --> 00:27:16.667
I like your headband.

563
00:27:17.542 --> 00:27:18.125
Thanks.

564
00:27:19.792 --> 00:27:20.958
Do you need something?

565
00:27:21.042 --> 00:27:24.042
[sighs] Well. I have
this interview tonight.

566
00:27:24.042 --> 00:27:26.375
so I was wondering if you
would make something to eat

567
00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:27.792
for Willow.

568
00:27:27.875 --> 00:27:29.875
Vernon fired the chef.
so. we're adapting.

569
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.125
Sure. I make a mean quesadilla.

570
00:27:31.208 --> 00:27:33.542
Oh. no. no. No cheese.
not in this house.

571
00:27:33.625 --> 00:27:35.000
Cheese. bad. Got it.

572
00:27:35.083 --> 00:27:36.500
If that's everything.
I'll just go unpack.

573
00:27:36.542 --> 00:27:38.083
Well actually. there's
one more thing.

574
00:27:38.208 --> 00:27:40.458
We're having this little
get together here tomorrow

575
00:27:40.542 --> 00:27:42.375
and Willow is
staying at her dad's.

576
00:27:42.458 --> 00:27:43.917
Oh. so you don't need me then?

577
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.167
Well. actually I was
hoping you wanted to come.

578
00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:47.750
Oh. thanks.

579
00:27:47.833 --> 00:27:49.708
Um. I was thinking I could
use that time to write though.

580
00:27:49.792 --> 00:27:51.750
With Willow and Hudson--

581
00:27:51.833 --> 00:27:53.917
Can I be honest with you?
It's kind of important.

582
00:27:54.042 --> 00:27:56.250
And with all the staff
being fired. I have no one.

583
00:27:57.417 --> 00:27:59.583
I could really use your help.

584
00:27:59.667 --> 00:28:03.667
Okay. Yeah. Um. it'll
be fun. I guess.

585
00:28:03.708 --> 00:28:05.500
Yeah. it'll be a nightmare.

586
00:28:05.583 --> 00:28:08.292
[soft somber music]

587
00:28:15.125 --> 00:28:16.125
All right.

588
00:28:18.375 --> 00:28:21.417
One quinoa salad with kale and
a drizzle of vegan dressing.

589
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.667
Great. Just what I didn't want.

590
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:28.625
Yeah. Didn't sound good
while I was saying it.

591
00:28:28.708 --> 00:28:32.083
You know what? I've got an idea.

592
00:28:36.458 --> 00:28:37.500
[TV audience cheers]

593
00:28:37.583 --> 00:28:39.167
Oh my god.

594
00:28:39.208 --> 00:28:40.792
I know. I know.

595
00:28:40.875 --> 00:28:41.958
I'm sorry. I'm supposed
to be promoting the movie.

596
00:28:42.042 --> 00:28:44.833
I'm just so excited
for my wedding.

597
00:28:44.875 --> 00:28:46.667
Look. we don't
have to watch this.

598
00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:48.708
No. no. This is some
of her best acting.

599
00:28:48.792 --> 00:28:50.250
[Justice] And the tour
starting this summer--

600
00:28:50.333 --> 00:28:53.042
Actually. it's late.

601
00:28:53.125 --> 00:28:55.833
How 'bout you get ready for
bed before your mom gets back?

602
00:28:55.875 --> 00:28:57.000
Can you do that for me?

603
00:28:57.125 --> 00:28:58.333
[Justice] Yeah.
yeah. the fifth album

604
00:28:58.417 --> 00:28:59.500
is coming out. so.
- Yeah.

605
00:28:59.583 --> 00:29:01.625
Hey. Gabby?
- Hm?

606
00:29:01.708 --> 00:29:03.500
Thanks for this.

607
00:29:03.583 --> 00:29:04.792
[Justice] A lot of
things happening.

608
00:29:04.875 --> 00:29:06.958
I never get to just
chill and be a kid.

609
00:29:08.833 --> 00:29:10.958
It's nice to have
someone actually see me.

610
00:29:12.708 --> 00:29:14.167
Good night.

611
00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:15.833
Night. Willow.

612
00:29:15.958 --> 00:29:16.625
I'll see you up there.

613
00:29:16.708 --> 00:29:17.333
[Willow] Yeah.

614
00:29:19.625 --> 00:29:21.792

[soft mysterious music]

617
00:29:30.833 --> 00:29:32.917
[Ian] You're in trouble.

618
00:29:32.917 --> 00:29:35.833
Don't worry. love. It'll
be our little secret.

619
00:29:35.958 --> 00:29:38.000
Sure it's one of many to come.

620
00:29:39.542 --> 00:29:40.500
I didn't even know
you were here.

621
00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:43.750
I shouldn't.

622
00:29:44.833 --> 00:29:47.167
You're relieved of duty.

623
00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:48.792
Who's left to nanny.
other than me?

624
00:29:50.667 --> 00:29:52.333
Actually. I have
some writing to do.

625
00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:55.292
Anything I've read?

626
00:29:56.542 --> 00:29:57.167
Not yet.

627
00:29:59.125 --> 00:30:02.292
Wait. wait. wait. don't.
Come on. just one. Please?

628
00:30:03.292 --> 00:30:06.792
[soft mysterious music]

629
00:30:06.875 --> 00:30:07.833
Good night. Nan.

630
00:30:07.917 --> 00:30:09.125
Good night.

631
00:30:11.292 --> 00:30:13.292
Alone again. naturally.

632
00:30:20.917 --> 00:30:22.500
All ready for bed?

633
00:30:22.583 --> 00:30:24.125
Almost.

634
00:30:24.208 --> 00:30:25.042
Get some sleep.

635
00:30:27.458 --> 00:30:32.000
Hey. Gabby. Are you
gonna stay with us?

636
00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.667
Would you like that?

637
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:42.583
Maybe. You knew my mom. right?
When she was still normal?

638
00:30:44.333 --> 00:30:47.042
I met her once when I was
younger than you are now.

639
00:30:47.125 --> 00:30:48.917
My mom knew her really well.

640
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.375
You seem normal.

641
00:30:50.458 --> 00:30:52.333
Oh. uh. thank you?

642
00:30:54.333 --> 00:30:55.208
Mia did too.

643
00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:58.708
You miss her?

644
00:30:58.792 --> 00:31:01.000
Yeah. and she didn't
steal from us.

645
00:31:01.042 --> 00:31:03.083
She wouldn't do that.
She was a good nanny.

646
00:31:04.708 --> 00:31:06.458
Hmm.

647
00:31:06.542 --> 00:31:09.292
Just promise me you won't
leave like everyone else.

648
00:31:11.542 --> 00:31:12.375
I promise.

649
00:31:14.875 --> 00:31:16.625
Now get some sleep.

650
00:31:16.708 --> 00:31:17.417
Okay.

651
00:31:17.542 --> 00:31:18.583
See you in the morning.

652
00:31:18.667 --> 00:31:20.250

Put that there. but we need
more towels in this part.

666
00:33:26.833 --> 00:33:28.333
Don't forget.

667
00:33:28.458 --> 00:33:30.583
What's all this? I thought
this was a small dinner party.

668
00:33:30.667 --> 00:33:33.000
Love. I don't really do small
dinner parties. all right?

669
00:33:33.042 --> 00:33:35.708
This is like a party.
party. A real party.

670
00:33:35.833 --> 00:33:38.083
Does Damian know
it's bigger now?

671
00:33:38.167 --> 00:33:39.750
Yeah. no need to worry.
There's NDAs far and wide.

672
00:33:39.833 --> 00:33:41.167
Everybody knows not
to say anything.

otherwise they get the

Justice said all the
staff was let go.

675
00:33:44.458 --> 00:33:45.917
Then you should be thanking me.

676
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.667
Otherwise. you would be
arranging the canopies.

679
00:33:53.667 --> 00:33:55.375
Bring that over here.
I wanna smell it.

680

00:35:24.958 --> 00:35:26.958
Thank you so much
for being here.

705
00:35:27.042 --> 00:35:28.333
You know the proposal
was for the press.

706
00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:31.125
but this is the A-list. and
I really need them to see

707
00:35:31.208 --> 00:35:33.833
that Ian can behave
around the new. hot nanny.

708
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.667
Is that the only
reason you invited me?

709
00:35:36.708 --> 00:35:39.458
No. No. no. of course not.

710
00:35:39.542 --> 00:35:42.292
Oh. and guys. she's
an amazing writer.

711
00:35:42.375 --> 00:35:44.458
And I know you're all
looking for screenplays.

712
00:35:44.542 --> 00:35:46.500
So. here she is.

713
00:35:46.583 --> 00:35:49.083
Go network. You'll
thank me later.

714
00:35:49.167 --> 00:35:52.125
But. that's not what I write.

715
00:35:52.208 --> 00:35:55.417
â™ª This is the sound we make

716
00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:58.708
â™ª These are the rules we break

717
00:35:58.833 --> 00:36:00.375
â™ª Step up. cross the line

718
00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:02.250
Don't worry about him. Nan.

719
00:36:02.333 --> 00:36:04.375
He just doesn't like being
around this much fun.

720
00:36:04.458 --> 00:36:06.417
We both have that in common.

721
00:36:06.542 --> 00:36:07.708
Come on. where you going?

722
00:36:07.792 --> 00:36:10.333
â™ª It kills my appetite

723
00:36:10.417 --> 00:36:12.333
All right. Bye. Nan.

724
00:36:14.583 --> 00:36:15.542
Party. whoo!

725
00:36:16.542 --> 00:36:19.042
[crowd cheers]

726
00:36:19.125 --> 00:36:22.333
[deep mysterious music]

727
00:36:27.708 --> 00:36:28.542
Hm.

728
00:36:29.958 --> 00:36:33.292
[deep suspenseful music]

729
00:36:37.792 --> 00:36:38.708
Hey!

730
00:36:40.333 --> 00:36:41.667
[Justice] And I met.
for the first time.

731
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:43.333
I was asking. I'm
like. "Are you okay?"

732
00:36:43.417 --> 00:36:44.250
He's like. "No. I'm
not." I'm like--

733
00:36:44.333 --> 00:36:45.292
[Gabby] Hey.

734
00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:47.292
Damian!

735
00:36:49.125 --> 00:36:50.958
Damian. Damian!

736
00:36:51.042 --> 00:36:51.583
Get him!

737
00:36:53.708 --> 00:36:57.167
It's the stalker. the
guy from the club.

738
00:36:57.250 --> 00:36:59.833
[glass shatters]

739
00:36:59.917 --> 00:37:02.583
[tense scary music]

740
00:37:08.542 --> 00:37:11.333
[water splashes]

741
00:37:11.458 --> 00:37:14.583
[tense eerie music]

742
00:37:16.708 --> 00:37:18.667
[gunshot blasts]

743
00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:21.333
[crowd yelling]

744
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.125
[Damian coughs]

745
00:37:27.208 --> 00:37:29.625
[tense music]

746
00:37:31.875 --> 00:37:33.083
Are you okay?

747
00:37:33.167 --> 00:37:34.333
[Damian] Yeah. yeah.

748
00:37:34.417 --> 00:37:35.333
[Justice] Ian.
get everybody out.

749
00:37:35.417 --> 00:37:37.042
Everybody has to leave now.

750
00:37:37.125 --> 00:37:38.208
You heard the woman.
everybody out.

751
00:37:38.292 --> 00:37:40.958
Party's over. Come on.
tah-tah. Off you go.

752
00:37:41.042 --> 00:37:43.750
[deep somber music]

753
00:37:49.333 --> 00:37:52.292
For the last time. I have
to vet every single person

754
00:37:52.375 --> 00:37:54.833
who comes into this
house. no exceptions.

755
00:37:54.875 --> 00:37:56.500
Well. how am I supposed
to throw a kick-ass.

756
00:37:56.583 --> 00:37:58.500
trend-worthy party if
Vernon's firing all the staff?

757
00:37:58.542 --> 00:37:59.625
You think the help
was expensive?

758
00:37:59.708 --> 00:38:01.125
Wait until we get the price tag

759
00:38:01.208 --> 00:38:02.750
to keep this out of the press.

760
00:38:02.833 --> 00:38:04.417
And just so I know. what do
you think the nanny is for?

761
00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:06.583
You know what? Don't
even answer that.

762
00:38:06.667 --> 00:38:09.375
Excuse me. You all do
realize that I am a nanny.

763
00:38:09.458 --> 00:38:11.667
I'm not here to help
you plan parties

764
00:38:11.708 --> 00:38:14.500
or get ready for events. but
I do need to keep Willow safe.

765
00:38:14.583 --> 00:38:17.458
She's right. That's not her job.

766
00:38:17.458 --> 00:38:20.042
And we all have to
be careful. Okay?

767
00:38:20.167 --> 00:38:21.250
[Gabby] So who is
that Isaac guy?

768
00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:22.333
[Ian] Who?

769
00:38:22.417 --> 00:38:24.083
Your stalker or whatever?

770
00:38:24.167 --> 00:38:25.542
Isaac. the guy you're
supposed to have

771
00:38:25.625 --> 00:38:28.167
a restraining order
against. he was here.

772
00:38:28.208 --> 00:38:29.500
[Justice] What?

773
00:38:29.542 --> 00:38:30.333
I caught him trying
to go into my room

774
00:38:30.417 --> 00:38:32.000
before the lady attacked.

775
00:38:32.083 --> 00:38:33.667
Maybe they're. I don't know.
maybe they're working together.

776
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:35.292
It can't be a
coincidence. Can it?

777
00:38:35.375 --> 00:38:36.125
Unless you're mistaken.

778
00:38:36.208 --> 00:38:38.000
I'm not. He was here.

779
00:38:38.083 --> 00:38:39.500
How many caterers did you hire?

780
00:38:39.583 --> 00:38:40.708
Three.

781
00:38:40.792 --> 00:38:42.167
Isaac makes four.

782
00:38:42.208 --> 00:38:44.667
He was in my house?
What if Willow was here?

783
00:38:44.708 --> 00:38:46.208
Let's calm down. We don't
know what he was after.

784
00:38:46.292 --> 00:38:48.167
But we know he was
in my house. Vernon.

785
00:38:48.292 --> 00:38:49.625
I'm sorry. that's
Damian's department.

786
00:38:49.625 --> 00:38:51.292
Look. I'm gonna call the LAPD.

787
00:38:51.375 --> 00:38:53.167
I'll get in touch with
Rhodes. the parole officer.

788
00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:54.708
He's got a restraining order.

789
00:38:54.792 --> 00:38:56.375
We'll make sure that they
take care of it. Okay?

790
00:38:56.458 --> 00:38:57.917
[sighs] Thank you.

791
00:38:58.042 --> 00:39:00.417
Can we just keep it together
until the damn show?

792
00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:03.167
No more surprises. Keep
it out of the press.

793
00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:04.917
And Hudson cannot find out.

794
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.458
You're not gonna tell Hudson?

795
00:39:06.542 --> 00:39:08.042
Whose side are you on?

796
00:39:08.125 --> 00:39:09.417
Hers. of course. And Willow's.

797
00:39:09.542 --> 00:39:11.417
Okay. so keep Hudson out of it.

798
00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:12.792
And remember your NDA.

799
00:39:12.875 --> 00:39:14.333
I understand the NDA.

800
00:39:14.417 --> 00:39:17.250
I just think it's a mistake
not to tell her father.

801
00:39:17.333 --> 00:39:19.833
Gabby. he will take
her away from me.

802
00:39:19.875 --> 00:39:22.000
It's complicated. but
there's a lot on the line.

803
00:39:23.333 --> 00:39:24.708
Please. For me.

804
00:39:26.292 --> 00:39:27.667
But you're gonna look
into this. right?

805
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:29.458
Absolutely.

806
00:39:29.542 --> 00:39:31.625
Damian has friends at the
police station. and I trust him.

807
00:39:31.625 --> 00:39:33.667
I know he will keep
me safe. and Willow.

808
00:39:33.708 --> 00:39:36.583
[sighs] Now. everybody.
let's get some sleep. Okay?

809
00:39:36.708 --> 00:39:39.000
It's been a long night. [sighs]

810
00:39:40.375 --> 00:39:43.625
[soft mysterious music]

811
00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:15.667
[Ian] You gotta stop calling
me with all this drama.

812
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:17.042
I told you. this isn't like Mia.

813
00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:22.000
It'd be brilliant publicity.
but no. we can't do that now.

814
00:40:22.042 --> 00:40:23.250
You better not.

815
00:40:23.333 --> 00:40:25.250
No. she doesn't know a thing.

816
00:40:25.333 --> 00:40:29.375
No. I know. but we gotta wait
or this is all worthless.

817
00:40:30.917 --> 00:40:33.833
I don't know. she's
pushing my full act. right?

818
00:40:33.917 --> 00:40:34.667
Isn't she?

819
00:40:36.375 --> 00:40:38.000
Yeah. So. not so very long then.

820
00:40:40.917 --> 00:40:43.792
[footsteps clicking]

821
00:40:47.833 --> 00:40:51.833
I gotta go. Um. I'll
ring you later. Yeah?

822
00:40:51.917 --> 00:40:52.792
All right.

823
00:40:59.042 --> 00:41:02.167
[computer keys clicking]

824
00:41:06.583 --> 00:41:07.917
[chuckles] That's
quite the outfit.

825
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.333
Well. thank you.

826
00:41:09.417 --> 00:41:11.792
I'm playing a saloon girl
who gets attacked by zombies.

827
00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:14.625
I'm just home for lunch.

828
00:41:15.458 --> 00:41:16.417
Mm.

829
00:41:18.208 --> 00:41:18.917
Oh.

830
00:41:21.042 --> 00:41:22.083
there's a package for you.

831
00:41:22.167 --> 00:41:24.083
Oh. yes.

832
00:41:24.167 --> 00:41:25.750
Thank you.

833
00:41:25.833 --> 00:41:29.583
Anyways. the production is
kind of like. it's okay.

834
00:41:29.667 --> 00:41:31.333
I'm a little bit bored by now.

835
00:41:31.417 --> 00:41:33.167
but at the same time.
this outfit though.

836
00:41:33.208 --> 00:41:37.250
this outfit is so amazing.
so sexy. I just love it.

837
00:41:37.333 --> 00:41:39.458
What is? You seem...

838
00:41:41.125 --> 00:41:43.458
I'm not gonna tell you about
my cute date with the hot guy.

839
00:41:45.083 --> 00:41:46.458
Why are you being so weird?

840
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:50.167
Okay. I need to
tell you something.

841
00:41:50.208 --> 00:41:51.583
but you cannot repeat it.

842
00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:53.167
Mm-hm.

843
00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:54.208
Promise me?

844
00:41:54.208 --> 00:41:54.958
Uh-huh.

845
00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:00.625
Okay.

846
00:42:00.708 --> 00:42:02.208
I went to this dumb
Hollywood party

847
00:42:02.333 --> 00:42:04.042
that Ian threw for Justice.

848
00:42:04.125 --> 00:42:05.292
Oh my god. so lucky.

849
00:42:05.375 --> 00:42:06.667
No.

850
00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:07.708
This crazy lady
showed up with a gun

851
00:42:07.792 --> 00:42:10.208
and tried to kill Justice.

852
00:42:10.333 --> 00:42:12.750
I think something might've
happened to the last nanny.

853
00:42:12.833 --> 00:42:14.417
She was talking to someone.

854
00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:16.875
sending them information about
Justice and the house and--

855
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.917
She drowned in the pool.
I read all about it.

856
00:42:19.042 --> 00:42:21.833
I think she had something
going on with Ian before.

857
00:42:21.917 --> 00:42:26.167
Well. I hope you're taking
notes for your future book.

858
00:42:27.708 --> 00:42:30.375
I smell a bestseller.

859
00:42:30.375 --> 00:42:33.125
[soft somber music]

860
00:42:43.667 --> 00:42:46.000
[phone chirps]

861
00:42:47.458 --> 00:42:50.042
Gabs. your little
flip phone's on.

862
00:42:51.208 --> 00:42:53.333
And. I have a date tonight.

863
00:42:53.417 --> 00:42:54.750
- Beautiful.
- Mm-hmm.

864
00:42:55.833 --> 00:42:58.000
Somebody was warning her.

865
00:42:58.042 --> 00:42:58.917
Who?

866
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.000
The last nanny.

867
00:43:00.167 --> 00:43:00.917
About what?

868
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.500
I don't know.

869
00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:05.542
I need to show this to Damian.
Justice could be in danger.

870
00:43:09.542 --> 00:43:12.333
Ugh. it's Ian. They
need me at the club.

871
00:43:12.333 --> 00:43:15.125
Ian Pierce is texting you and
that's your tone of voice?

872
00:43:15.208 --> 00:43:15.958
I have to go.

873
00:43:17.417 --> 00:43:19.083
You have to go nanny now?

874
00:43:19.167 --> 00:43:20.958
If Justice is there.
Damian will be too.

875
00:43:21.042 --> 00:43:22.292
Okay.

876
00:43:22.375 --> 00:43:24.208
After the party. I don't
wanna take any chances.

877
00:43:24.292 --> 00:43:25.542
Good luck.

878
00:43:25.667 --> 00:43:28.292
[mysterious music]

879
00:43:34.875 --> 00:43:38.292
[pop music in background]

880
00:43:45.292 --> 00:43:46.208
Yes. Is this mine?

881
00:43:46.292 --> 00:43:47.458
Yeah.

882
00:43:47.458 --> 00:43:49.125
Oh.

883
00:43:49.208 --> 00:43:52.292
You can't seriously wanna go
back there and play this out.

884
00:43:52.375 --> 00:43:53.917
I mean. what if you'd been shot?

885
00:43:54.042 --> 00:43:56.083
I told you. no choice now.

886
00:43:56.167 --> 00:43:58.000
All the checks have
already been cashed.

887
00:43:58.042 --> 00:44:00.833
Imagine the press if I just
blew this whole thing up.

888
00:44:00.875 --> 00:44:02.917
Samara. you can't do that.

889
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.167
But what you and I
have is real. isn't it?

890
00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:07.458
Doesn't that make
it so much better?

891
00:44:07.542 --> 00:44:08.875
And we'll have that again.

892
00:44:08.958 --> 00:44:10.292
I told you. just give it time.

893
00:44:10.375 --> 00:44:11.167
You promise?

894
00:44:11.208 --> 00:44:12.292
Course I do.

895
00:44:12.417 --> 00:44:13.875
Don't lie to me.

896
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:14.958
I promise.

897
00:44:19.375 --> 00:44:21.750
[lips smack]

898
00:44:21.833 --> 00:44:24.000
[Gabby clears throat]

899
00:44:24.125 --> 00:44:27.375
Oy. nanny. Glad
you could join us.

900
00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:30.458
I'm not joining you.
Where's Justice?

901
00:44:30.458 --> 00:44:31.250
Not here.

902
00:44:31.333 --> 00:44:32.458
Obviously.

903
00:44:32.542 --> 00:44:34.083
Who is this?

904
00:44:34.167 --> 00:44:34.875
Who are you?

905
00:44:34.958 --> 00:44:38.167
I've designated her. driver.

906
00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:41.167
And I've gone and drunk
over my security code.

907
00:44:41.208 --> 00:44:42.917
You can give me a
hand with that. right?

908
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.917
And I can see this
is pointless. God.

909
00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:49.500
Oh. she's a professional.

910
00:44:49.583 --> 00:44:51.000
Well. that's two girls tonight.

911
00:44:52.458 --> 00:44:54.792
Don't leave me. Nanny. Please.

912
00:44:56.042 --> 00:44:57.500
I need you to help me
get home. all right?

913
00:44:57.583 --> 00:44:59.208
Fine. Let's go.

914
00:45:00.708 --> 00:45:04.667
[upbeat pop music in background]

915
00:45:10.583 --> 00:45:12.500
I gotta go to the
little boys room.

916
00:45:12.583 --> 00:45:13.250
I'll be right back.

917
00:45:15.625 --> 00:45:16.583
Unless you wanna help.

918
00:45:16.667 --> 00:45:17.917
That's disgusting.

919
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:18.917
Just go please.
- All right.

920
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.792
Hey. still gotta pay for this.

921
00:45:21.875 --> 00:45:23.125
Oh. he'll be right back.

922
00:45:23.125 --> 00:45:24.333
Look. lady. we're closing up.

923
00:45:34.375 --> 00:45:35.333
I got that.

924
00:45:35.375 --> 00:45:37.875
So tell me. what do you do?

925
00:45:37.875 --> 00:45:40.625
Spy in the shadows
and lurking on people.

926
00:45:40.708 --> 00:45:42.167
I wasn't spying.

927
00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:45.125
Ian asked me to come. I thought
Justice was gonna be here.

928
00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:47.333
Well she isn't.

929
00:45:47.417 --> 00:45:48.833
I wonder what you'll tell her.

930
00:45:48.875 --> 00:45:51.292
It's none of my business.

931
00:45:51.375 --> 00:45:53.417
But if you want it to be.

932
00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:55.500
you know. you can make a
lot of money in this town.

933
00:45:55.583 --> 00:45:57.125
selling people's secrets.

934
00:45:57.208 --> 00:45:59.625
especially when
they're celebrities.

935
00:45:59.708 --> 00:46:02.708
And you should call me.

936
00:46:05.917 --> 00:46:08.042
Oh. do you need a nanny?

937
00:46:08.125 --> 00:46:09.917
You're cute.

938
00:46:10.042 --> 00:46:11.833
You know what? I like you.

939
00:46:11.958 --> 00:46:14.000
Ian actually told me about
your little book deal thing

940
00:46:14.042 --> 00:46:17.750
you've got going on with Hudson.
and I can't say it's bad.

941
00:46:17.833 --> 00:46:19.125
You know. I admire it.

942
00:46:19.208 --> 00:46:20.542
We're all just trying
to get a little piece

943
00:46:20.667 --> 00:46:22.333
of that Justice pie.

944
00:46:22.375 --> 00:46:24.208
Well. I'm just here to
look out for Willow.

945
00:46:24.292 --> 00:46:27.875
Oh honey. you need
to look after you.

946
00:46:27.958 --> 00:46:29.833
You know. especially
in that house.

947
00:46:29.875 --> 00:46:32.292
where all the little nannies
are dropping like flies.

948
00:46:34.917 --> 00:46:38.208
Well. just make sure he gets
home safe and untouched.

949
00:46:40.167 --> 00:46:41.875
Don't have to worry about that.

950
00:46:43.292 --> 00:46:45.875
[Samara groans]

951
00:46:47.958 --> 00:46:52.792
â™ª Nobody knows the
nannies I've seen â™ª

952
00:46:52.875 --> 00:46:57.458
Oopsie daisy. Your hair
smells like cinnamon buns.

953
00:46:58.917 --> 00:47:01.167
Right here'll do
just brilliantly.

954
00:47:02.542 --> 00:47:03.292
Ooh.

955
00:47:06.458 --> 00:47:07.583
Glad to be of service.

956
00:47:07.708 --> 00:47:09.292
Oh. lighten up. Nan.

957
00:47:09.375 --> 00:47:12.458
Don't you know it's
all a charade by now?

958
00:47:13.833 --> 00:47:16.250
Ian. are you
cheating on Justice?

959
00:47:17.792 --> 00:47:20.792
[laughs] Cheating?

960
00:47:22.708 --> 00:47:25.208
Love. this is show business.

961
00:47:25.208 --> 00:47:27.083
And as long as the show goes on.

962
00:47:28.125 --> 00:47:30.917
business is good. for everyone.

963
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.833
All right. even as we speak.

964
00:47:33.875 --> 00:47:37.875
Justice is at the stage.
burning her midnight oils

965
00:47:37.875 --> 00:47:39.958
and whatnot [groans].

966
00:47:41.875 --> 00:47:44.417
She has her process.
I have mine.

967
00:47:47.708 --> 00:47:49.458
Come on. Have a drink with me.

968
00:47:49.542 --> 00:47:51.417
No. it's late.

969
00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:53.208
No. no. no. no. Gabby.

970
00:47:55.042 --> 00:47:57.417
Come on. just.
just one. Come on.

971
00:47:59.708 --> 00:48:01.000
Come on. please.

972
00:48:01.083 --> 00:48:02.292
Come on. come on.

973
00:48:02.375 --> 00:48:03.958
Okay. Okay. Just one.

974
00:48:04.875 --> 00:48:06.333
[Gabby sighs]

975
00:48:06.417 --> 00:48:07.208
Cheers.

976
00:48:12.292 --> 00:48:13.917
Were you this friendly with Mia?

977
00:48:18.333 --> 00:48:20.458
I'm afraid the truth is
tamer than the tabloids.

978
00:48:20.542 --> 00:48:23.000
though not for a lack
of trying. on her part.

979
00:48:26.375 --> 00:48:28.542
[Ian groans]

980
00:48:30.375 --> 00:48:33.250
There's nothing wrong with
an innocent little game.

981
00:48:36.333 --> 00:48:37.125
Is there?

982
00:48:39.875 --> 00:48:42.292
[Ian laughs]

983
00:48:45.333 --> 00:48:47.333
I'll give you that one. Nanny.

984
00:48:47.375 --> 00:48:49.375
We should do it again
sometime though.

985
00:48:51.375 --> 00:48:54.042
[soft tense music]

986
00:49:05.042 --> 00:49:07.417
[phone flips shut]

987
00:49:13.292 --> 00:49:14.458
- [Hudson] One year-- - [Willow]
One year. one year. yeah.

988
00:49:15.542 --> 00:49:16.417
Gabby.

989
00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:17.167
Hey guys.

990
00:49:17.333 --> 00:49:18.958
Where's Mom?

991
00:49:19.042 --> 00:49:20.542
Oh. she's not here. She's
working on the show.

992
00:49:20.625 --> 00:49:21.833
But hey. I made you breakfast.

993
00:49:21.875 --> 00:49:22.458
Okay.

994
00:49:24.042 --> 00:49:26.417
Tell you what. how
about after breakfast

995
00:49:26.417 --> 00:49:28.000
I take you over to watch
some of the rehearsal.

996
00:49:28.083 --> 00:49:29.208
Sound fun?

997
00:49:29.292 --> 00:49:30.667
I guess so.

998
00:49:30.792 --> 00:49:33.542
I'm just gonna go
put my stuff away.

999
00:49:33.625 --> 00:49:35.292
Okay. But. come back and eat.

1000
00:49:39.042 --> 00:49:40.125
Is she okay?

1001
00:49:40.208 --> 00:49:41.458
She gets this way sometimes.

1002
00:49:41.583 --> 00:49:43.542
It's the back and forth.
it's draining for her.

1003
00:49:43.625 --> 00:49:45.417
It only gets worse too when
Justice is doing her whole

1004
00:49:45.542 --> 00:49:47.000
Jay Gray thing.

1005
00:49:47.083 --> 00:49:48.417
Why don't I take her back?

1006
00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:51.333
No. it's fine. It's
good bonding time.

1007
00:49:51.417 --> 00:49:52.958
Well. I've got some important
work I gotta get to.

1008
00:49:53.042 --> 00:49:54.333
which includes
reading your book.

1009
00:49:54.417 --> 00:49:54.833
Which I noticed you
haven't sent me yet.

1010
00:49:54.917 --> 00:49:57.083
Oh. yeah. sorry.

1011
00:49:57.167 --> 00:49:59.708
It's been busy so I didn't feel
like it was ready to share.

1012
00:49:59.792 --> 00:50:01.000
I want it to be perfect.

1013
00:50:01.083 --> 00:50:02.708
Well. don't let the
craziness of around here

1014
00:50:02.792 --> 00:50:04.167
get in the way of
your real goals.

1015
00:50:05.917 --> 00:50:07.208
Why don't you send
it to me right now?

1016
00:50:07.333 --> 00:50:08.833
Now. now?

1017
00:50:08.875 --> 00:50:09.708
Yeah. Let me take a look.

1018
00:50:09.792 --> 00:50:11.125
No promises or anything. but.

1019
00:50:11.208 --> 00:50:12.042
[Gabby exhales sharply]

1020
00:50:12.125 --> 00:50:13.958
Yeah. yeah. okay.

1021
00:50:14.042 --> 00:50:17.125
[computer keys click]

1022
00:50:18.042 --> 00:50:19.792
There it goes.

1023
00:50:19.875 --> 00:50:22.083
All right. I'll see
you next weekend.

1024
00:50:23.292 --> 00:50:25.542
Uh. yeah. I'll be here.

1025
00:50:25.625 --> 00:50:29.667
[gentle mysterious music]

1026
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:32.833
[dramatic banging]

1027
00:50:32.875 --> 00:50:37.542
â™ª Oh. get your
shine on. shine on â™ª

1028
00:50:40.583 --> 00:50:45.458
â™ª Oh. get your
shine on. come on â™ª

1029
00:50:46.042 --> 00:50:48.083
â™ª Celebrate

1030
00:50:48.167 --> 00:50:50.542
â™ª Join the party

1031
00:50:50.542 --> 00:50:51.917
â™ª Love party

1032
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.458
â™ª Yeah. yeah

1033
00:50:53.542 --> 00:50:55.208
â™ª Celebrate

1034
00:50:55.292 --> 00:50:56.417
[Gabby] Well. this
is exciting. huh?

1035
00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:58.042
Rehearsal for your
mom's big show?

1036
00:50:58.125 --> 00:51:00.500
It's not like I've never
been to a rehearsal before.

1037
00:51:00.583 --> 00:51:01.625
Oh.

1038
00:51:01.708 --> 00:51:03.000
At least you get to
see your mom. right?

1039
00:51:03.083 --> 00:51:04.000
[Willow] Yeah.

1040
00:51:05.542 --> 00:51:06.750
But she's gonna be mad.

1041
00:51:06.833 --> 00:51:08.333
Why would she be mad?

1042
00:51:08.417 --> 00:51:10.250
Because nothing is more
important to her than work.

1043
00:51:11.250 --> 00:51:12.500
That's not true. Willow.

1044
00:51:14.375 --> 00:51:15.958
Your mom hired me because you
are the most important person

1045
00:51:16.042 --> 00:51:17.417
in her world.

1046
00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:18.250
She said that?

1047
00:51:19.083 --> 00:51:20.250
Of course.

1048
00:51:21.708 --> 00:51:23.000
But. we don't have to go
in if you don't want to.

1049
00:51:23.042 --> 00:51:25.167
[Willow] No. I wanna go.

1050
00:51:25.208 --> 00:51:26.375
Wouldn't wanna miss this.

1051
00:51:28.375 --> 00:51:31.667
â™ª 'Cause you're beautiful

00:51:31.708 --> 00:51:36.292
â™ª From the ghetto
to the West Side â™ª

00:51:36.375 --> 00:51:38.333
â™ª Bring the love tonight

00:51:38.417 --> 00:51:42.042
â™ª Red. yellow. black. white

to the West Side â™ª

1057
00:51:50.542 --> 00:51:52.833
Stop. stop. Stop. stop.
put me down. put me down.

1058
00:51:52.958 --> 00:51:54.167
[guitar riffs]
Ian. what are you doing?

1059
00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:55.333
This is when my solo starts.

1060
00:51:55.458 --> 00:51:56.542
and then the fire can explode--

1061
00:51:56.625 --> 00:51:57.333
No. no fire.

1062
00:51:57.458 --> 00:51:58.375
I don't understand. I mean--

1063
00:51:58.458 --> 00:51:59.500
Of course we can't have fire.

1064
00:51:59.583 --> 00:52:00.792
Look. love. I've had
54 shows over fire.

1065
00:52:00.875 --> 00:52:01.750
My fans kind of expect it.

1066
00:52:01.833 --> 00:52:03.125
Well. mine don't.

1067
00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:04.375
Well. I don't care
about your fans.

1068
00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:05.708
Oh my god. this
isn't gonna work.

1069
00:52:05.792 --> 00:52:07.667
Vernon. I can't work like this.

1070
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:08.583
It's not that big of a deal.

1071
00:52:08.667 --> 00:52:09.833
It is a big of a deal.

1072
00:52:09.875 --> 00:52:11.500
We can't afford to fire Ian.

1073
00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:14.500
Six mansions. It's like
$15 to go boom once. love.

1074
00:52:14.542 --> 00:52:15.458
Come on.
- What are you doing here?

1075
00:52:15.542 --> 00:52:17.083
Ah. can you hold

1076
00:52:17.167 --> 00:52:18.167
this for a second?
- No. No. no. no.

1077
00:52:18.333 --> 00:52:19.500
You guys cannot be
here right now. Okay?

1078
00:52:19.625 --> 00:52:20.333
She's busy. - [Justice]
Just give me a minute. okay?

1079
00:52:20.458 --> 00:52:21.375
She's not really in a good mood.

1080
00:52:21.458 --> 00:52:22.958
We are working and it is tough--

1081
00:52:23.042 --> 00:52:24.000
What's wrong?

1082
00:52:24.042 --> 00:52:26.208
Nothing. No. uh. I'm sorry.

1083
00:52:26.292 --> 00:52:27.500
I just thought it
would be a good idea

1084
00:52:27.583 --> 00:52:29.000
for Willow to see
her mom at work.

1085
00:52:29.083 --> 00:52:30.625
Oh. Willow. sweetie. come here.

1086
00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:34.333
Hey. sweetheart. I'm working.

1087
00:52:34.417 --> 00:52:36.333
And as much as I miss you.

1088
00:52:36.375 --> 00:52:38.125
I really want this
show to be perfect.

1089
00:52:38.208 --> 00:52:39.875
You always have to be perfect.

1090
00:52:39.958 --> 00:52:41.750
I know.

1091
00:52:41.833 --> 00:52:42.750
I know. I know. I know. I know.

1092
00:52:42.833 --> 00:52:44.375
Next time. call Vernon. Okay?

1093
00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:46.750
This is really not a great time.

1094
00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:48.375
Plus. it makes me look bad.

1095
00:52:48.458 --> 00:52:49.500
Sorry. I just thought--

1096
00:52:49.583 --> 00:52:50.583
I told you.

1097
00:52:50.667 --> 00:52:51.583
[Justice sighs]

1098
00:52:51.667 --> 00:52:52.750
I'm sorry. Mom.

1099
00:52:52.833 --> 00:52:54.458
It's okay. sweetie.
It's not your fault.

1100
00:52:54.542 --> 00:52:58.000
But now. scooch. 'cause
Mommy has to yell at Vernon.

1101
00:52:58.083 --> 00:52:59.625
What are you thinking? Like--

1102
00:52:59.708 --> 00:53:01.583
[Samara claps]

1103
00:53:01.667 --> 00:53:03.708
Well. this is cute.

1104
00:53:03.792 --> 00:53:08.333
Yeah. it's got kind of a
Vegas-y. shotgun wedding vibe.

1105
00:53:08.417 --> 00:53:10.417
That's right. I
shouldn't have said gun.

1106
00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:12.375
after what happened at your
little party the other night.

1107
00:53:12.458 --> 00:53:14.000
Mom. what is she talking about?

1108
00:53:14.083 --> 00:53:15.250
Nothing. honey. What
are you doing here?

1109
00:53:15.375 --> 00:53:17.250
And how did she get in?

1110
00:53:17.375 --> 00:53:19.500
Your entourage is looking
a little light lately.

1111
00:53:19.542 --> 00:53:21.167
I walked in.

1112
00:53:21.250 --> 00:53:22.500
How the mighty fall.

1113
00:53:22.542 --> 00:53:23.958
Samara. this is not
how this is done.

1114
00:53:24.042 --> 00:53:25.208
Samara. I told you
not to do this.

1115
00:53:25.333 --> 00:53:26.625
You look absolutely
mental right now.

1116
00:53:26.708 --> 00:53:28.583
You told me a lot
of things. Ian.

1117
00:53:28.667 --> 00:53:29.750
Here. why don't you tell
everyone all the things

1118
00:53:29.833 --> 00:53:32.042
that we talk about?

1119
00:53:32.125 --> 00:53:33.875
Or maybe they would like to
know what you and the new nanny

1120
00:53:33.958 --> 00:53:36.167
were up to last night.

1121
00:53:36.250 --> 00:53:37.708
She doesn't know what
she's talking about.

1122
00:53:37.792 --> 00:53:39.083
Oh really?

1123
00:53:39.167 --> 00:53:40.042
'Cause you're only
around to keep Ian

1124
00:53:40.125 --> 00:53:41.333
from running back to me.

1125
00:53:41.375 --> 00:53:43.708
and you sure go running
every time he calls.

1126
00:53:43.875 --> 00:53:45.167
Justice. she's lying.

1127
00:53:45.250 --> 00:53:47.167
So you weren't at the
club the other night?

1128
00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:48.167
It wasn't like that.

1129
00:53:48.250 --> 00:53:49.458
[Ian] That's enough. Samara.

1130
00:53:49.542 --> 00:53:50.375
Oh really?

1131
00:53:50.542 --> 00:53:51.750
You told me this little stunt

1132
00:53:51.833 --> 00:53:52.708
wouldn't last long.
- Damian. please

1133
00:53:52.792 --> 00:53:53.375
just get her out of here.

1134
00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:54.917
[Samara] Don't touch me.

1135
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:55.958
What are you doing?
- Bring my daughter home.

1136
00:53:56.042 --> 00:53:56.708
Get off of me. Get off of me.

1137
00:53:58.792 --> 00:53:59.875
You don't want your
daughter to know

1138
00:53:59.958 --> 00:54:01.833
you're still banging her dad?

1139
00:54:01.875 --> 00:54:02.375
[hand slaps]
[Samara grunts]

1140
00:54:02.458 --> 00:54:02.958
[Damian] No. Don't.

1141
00:54:04.833 --> 00:54:07.792
[Samara breathes heavily]

1142
00:54:07.875 --> 00:54:09.958
She doesn't love you. Ian.

1143
00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:13.208
She doesn't love you.

1144
00:54:14.375 --> 00:54:15.792
Why can't you see that?

1145
00:54:18.125 --> 00:54:19.333
All she does is use people.

1146
00:54:20.708 --> 00:54:23.333
And I. I love you.

1147
00:54:25.125 --> 00:54:28.208
You promised me. So
just come with me. okay?

1148
00:54:29.375 --> 00:54:32.125

00:54:34.292 --> 00:54:35.250

[slow somber music]

1152
00:54:44.542 --> 00:54:47.375
Screw you. Screw you.

1153
00:54:47.458 --> 00:54:49.458
You know what? Screw all of you.

1154
00:54:49.542 --> 00:54:50.958
If you won't come back with me.

1155
00:54:51.042 --> 00:54:53.667
I'll just find another
way to ruin this wedding.

[tense music]

1157
00:54:56.333 --> 00:54:58.375
Just a mess.

1158
00:54:58.458 --> 00:54:59.667
What are you doing?

1159
00:54:59.750 --> 00:55:01.208
No. Get. get off of
me. Don't touch me.

1160
00:55:01.292 --> 00:55:02.250
I'm leaving.

1161
00:55:03.542 --> 00:55:05.583
Justice. baby. you're
gonna be so sorry.

1162
00:55:07.208 --> 00:55:08.208
So sorry!

Gabby. yes.

1206
00:58:36.708 --> 00:58:38.292
And you found the body?

Yes.

1208
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:41.167
She sent me a text
to meet her here.

1209
00:58:41.250 --> 00:58:43.125
that she had something
important to tell me.

1210

Are you two friends?

00:58:47.458 --> 00:58:48.750
Why you?

1213
00:58:48.833 --> 00:58:50.333
I don't know why.
um. she asked me.

1214
00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:52.042
I just know that
she was really upset

1215
00:58:52.125 --> 00:58:53.542
when she showed up at
the rehearsal today.

1216
00:58:53.625 --> 00:58:54.708
She threatened Justice.

1217
00:58:54.708 --> 00:58:56.750
Threatened? How so?

1218
00:58:56.833 --> 00:58:59.333
She told her there
was something going on

1219
00:58:59.417 --> 00:59:02.583
between me and Ian. and if she
didn't break it off with him.

1220
00:59:02.667 --> 00:59:04.375
she was going to do
something drastic.

1221
00:59:04.458 --> 00:59:08.417
Hmm. So is there something
going on between you and Ian?

1222
00:59:08.542 --> 00:59:10.625
No. [sighs]

1223
00:59:11.917 --> 00:59:13.500
Do you happen to recognize this?

1224
00:59:14.542 --> 00:59:15.750
It's very unique.

1225
00:59:15.875 --> 00:59:17.750
I think that's my roommate's.

1226
00:59:17.875 --> 00:59:20.083
I borrowed it a long time ago.

1227
00:59:20.167 --> 00:59:20.833
Why do you have that?

1228
00:59:20.917 --> 00:59:24.083
We found it. in her hand.

1229
00:59:24.083 --> 00:59:25.667
Any idea how it got there?

1230
00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:27.667
No.

1231
00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:29.500
I never wear those. I didn't
even know I still had them.

1232
00:59:29.583 --> 00:59:30.958
Any idea where the other one is?

1233
00:59:31.042 --> 00:59:32.125
No.

1234
00:59:32.208 --> 00:59:34.083
Rhodes. where are
we going with this?

1235
00:59:34.167 --> 00:59:36.083
What are you suggesting?

1236
00:59:36.167 --> 00:59:37.833
Nothing yet.

1237
00:59:37.917 --> 00:59:40.500
It appears to be a suicide.
so for now. we're done.

1238
00:59:40.583 --> 00:59:42.667
But don't go anywhere. Nanny.

1239
00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:44.292
I think I might have some
more questions for you.

1240
00:59:44.375 --> 00:59:44.958
Uh?

1241
00:59:46.292 --> 00:59:47.083
[Damian] Rhodes.

1242
00:59:50.292 --> 00:59:51.750
I'm gonna take her home.

1243
00:59:51.833 --> 00:59:52.375
I'll let you know if I
have any more information

1244
00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:53.583
later tonight. okay?

1245
00:59:53.667 --> 00:59:54.417
I'm just trying to do my job.

1246
00:59:54.542 --> 00:59:55.625
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1247
00:59:57.583 --> 00:59:59.458
Hey. Gabby. I'll take you home.

1248
00:59:59.542 --> 01:00:00.542
Yeah.

1249
01:00:03.125 --> 01:00:04.500
Thank you.

1250
01:00:04.625 --> 01:00:07.708
[gentle somber music]

1251
01:00:09.375 --> 01:00:12.750
[computer keys clicking]

1252
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:16.625
Willow!

1253
01:00:16.708 --> 01:00:17.625
Hudson. hey. What--

1254
01:00:17.708 --> 01:00:18.958
Where's Willow?

1255
01:00:19.042 --> 01:00:20.083
You didn't think to tell
me about the shooting

1256
01:00:20.208 --> 01:00:21.667
at my daughter's
house the other night?

1257
01:00:21.833 --> 01:00:23.500
I had to hear that from
Willow. She called me crying.

1258
01:00:23.542 --> 01:00:24.333
Willow!

1259
01:00:24.417 --> 01:00:25.667
Justice told me--

1260
01:00:25.667 --> 01:00:27.292
Told you not to tell
me? Of course she did.

1261
01:00:27.375 --> 01:00:28.833
Of course she did. Willow.

1262
01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:31.000
Hey. go pack your stuff. You're
gonna come with me. okay?

1263
01:00:31.125 --> 01:00:31.625
Okay.

1264
01:00:31.708 --> 01:00:33.375
Well. wait. no.

1265
01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:33.875
Willow's supposed
to be with me--

1266
01:00:34.042 --> 01:00:35.167
I am her father!

1267
01:00:35.208 --> 01:00:37.000
She is coming with
me. Willow. go.

1268
01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:39.792
Oh look. it's Super Dad.

1269
01:00:39.875 --> 01:00:41.208
How goes it. mate?
What are you doing?

1270
01:00:41.333 --> 01:00:42.708
Go take another drink
and don't worry about it.

1271
01:00:42.792 --> 01:00:44.667
Oh. a little hostile. aren't we?

1272
01:00:44.792 --> 01:00:46.500
No. what's hostile
is this environment.

1273
01:00:46.542 --> 01:00:47.875
And that party that you
threw the other night

1274
01:00:47.958 --> 01:00:49.667
that almost got Justice killed.

1275
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:50.708
Oh. you told him?

1276
01:00:50.792 --> 01:00:52.542
She didn't have to tell me.

1277
01:00:52.625 --> 01:00:53.875
I'm taking Willow.

1278
01:00:53.958 --> 01:00:54.792
Well. you can go
ahead and try mate.

1279
01:00:54.875 --> 01:00:55.917
but you gotta get past this.

1280
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.542
You gonna stop me?
Man of the house.

1281
01:00:57.625 --> 01:00:59.167
I got people for that. mate.

1282
01:00:59.208 --> 01:01:00.833
Oh yeah? Where's Damian?

1283
01:01:00.917 --> 01:01:02.417
With Justice. now why don't
you back up a little bit.

1284
01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:03.417
[fist thuds]

1285
01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:05.250
- Hudson!
- Dad!

1286
01:01:05.375 --> 01:01:06.625
Oh. okay.

1287
01:01:06.708 --> 01:01:08.000
I'm gonna sue your ass.

1288
01:01:08.125 --> 01:01:10.042
Wouldn't be very rockstar
of you. now would it?

1289
01:01:11.542 --> 01:01:12.292
Gabby. you coming?

1290
01:01:12.375 --> 01:01:13.583
Yeah.

1291
01:01:13.667 --> 01:01:16.958
[deep foreboding music]

1292
01:01:25.708 --> 01:01:28.125
[birds chirp]

1293
01:01:29.708 --> 01:01:31.333
Oh. Gabby. come
look at our fish.

1294
01:01:31.417 --> 01:01:32.958
Aw.

1295
01:01:32.958 --> 01:01:34.417
Hey. kiddo. why
don't you go play

1296
01:01:34.542 --> 01:01:36.542
while I get Gabby
settled. all right?

1297
01:01:36.625 --> 01:01:37.833
Okay.

1298
01:01:37.917 --> 01:01:39.042
Willow. backpack.

1299
01:01:40.208 --> 01:01:41.667
Thank you. Bye. Gabby.

1300
01:01:44.417 --> 01:01:45.208
[Gabby] Wow.

1301
01:01:46.958 --> 01:01:48.750
[Hudson] Welcome
to my house. Gabby.

1302
01:01:48.833 --> 01:01:50.042
It's like an oasis.

1303
01:01:53.208 --> 01:01:54.750
I'm sorry about what
happened with Ian.

1304
01:01:54.875 --> 01:01:56.000
Thank you for coming.

1305
01:01:57.375 --> 01:02:00.542
For the record. I voted to
tell you. about the attacks.

1306
01:02:00.625 --> 01:02:01.667
I just don't want my
daughter at that house

1307
01:02:01.792 --> 01:02:03.125
without security.

1308
01:02:03.208 --> 01:02:04.208
You guys can hang out
here during the day.

1309
01:02:04.292 --> 01:02:06.042
Damian's looking into it.

1310
01:02:06.167 --> 01:02:09.500
I just hate that you had to
find out the way you did.

1311
01:02:09.583 --> 01:02:11.250
It's just scary not
knowing what's happening

1312
01:02:11.333 --> 01:02:12.833
with Willow and Justice.

1313
01:02:12.917 --> 01:02:14.708
You care about her
a lot. don't you?

1314
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:17.167
Of course. she's my daughter.

1315
01:02:17.208 --> 01:02:20.042
I meant Justice. I've
seen you two together.

1316
01:02:23.417 --> 01:02:24.083
That's complicated.

1317
01:02:26.875 --> 01:02:29.583
Justice and I split up because
it seemed like her career

1318
01:02:29.667 --> 01:02:31.500
was more important
than her family.

1319
01:02:31.583 --> 01:02:34.208
But I was stupid. she supported
me when I was on my way up.

1320
01:02:34.333 --> 01:02:36.917
and I wasn't there for her
when she needed me the most.

1321
01:02:38.208 --> 01:02:40.000
She just got so
big. so fast that.

1322
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.458
it was a bit overwhelming.

1323
01:02:43.542 --> 01:02:44.208
So I left.

1324
01:02:45.375 --> 01:02:46.583
even though I still love her.

1325
01:02:46.667 --> 01:02:47.833
Then why aren't
you all together?

1326
01:02:47.917 --> 01:02:49.792
Why all the secrets?

1327
01:02:49.875 --> 01:02:50.667
She just has to keep
playing this Hollywood game

1328
01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:52.167
to stay on top.

1329
01:02:52.208 --> 01:02:54.125
And sadly. I can tell
that it's crushing her.

1330
01:02:54.917 --> 01:02:56.833
She's a strong woman.

1331
01:02:56.875 --> 01:02:58.500
Maybe if she knew someone
really cared about her.

1332
01:02:58.625 --> 01:03:00.833
she wouldn't need
all the charade.

1333
01:03:00.917 --> 01:03:03.042
But I mean. what do I
know? I'm just a nanny.

1334
01:03:03.125 --> 01:03:04.708
You know Gabby. I didn't
know what to feel about you

1335
01:03:04.792 --> 01:03:05.833
when I first met you.

1336
01:03:07.083 --> 01:03:08.708
but Willow absolutely loves you.

1337
01:03:08.792 --> 01:03:11.000
and you are a terrific writer.

1338
01:03:12.208 --> 01:03:13.333
You read my book?

1339
01:03:13.375 --> 01:03:15.208
I did. It's good.

1340
01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:18.333
I have notes. but. I think
you might have something.

1341
01:03:18.375 --> 01:03:20.042
In fact. if you wanna
look over those notes

1342
01:03:20.125 --> 01:03:22.208
while me and Willow hang out?

1343
01:03:22.333 --> 01:03:25.292
Yes. that would be
amazing. Thank you.

1344
01:03:25.375 --> 01:03:26.292
Of course.

1345
01:03:32.208 --> 01:03:34.500
[Gabby sighs]

1346
01:03:34.542 --> 01:03:37.000
This view is spectacular.

1347
01:03:37.125 --> 01:03:39.125
Believe it or not. this is
the first house that I bought

1348
01:03:39.208 --> 01:03:41.208
after I published my first book.

1349
01:03:41.292 --> 01:03:44.917
Justice and I lived here before
she became a big megastar.

1350
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.417
Willow was born
in this house too.

1351
01:03:48.458 --> 01:03:51.667
Anyway. if you wanna look
over the notes. you can.

1352
01:03:51.708 --> 01:03:54.792
[gentle solemn music]

1353
01:03:58.583 --> 01:04:01.917
[computer keys clicking]

1354
01:04:09.083 --> 01:04:10.792
[low battery alerts]

1355

[soft mysterious music]

[mysterious music swells]

01:04:37.125 --> 01:04:40.250
[tense foreboding music]

1358
01:05:04.042 --> 01:05:07.125
[soft dramatic music]

[banging on door]

1360
01:05:11.250 --> 01:05:13.333
That's not what it looks like.

1361
01:05:13.458 --> 01:05:14.792
Why do you have this?

1362
01:05:14.875 --> 01:05:15.875
To talk to Mia.

1363
01:05:16.875 --> 01:05:17.875
But it's not what you think.

1364
01:05:17.958 --> 01:05:18.708
How do you know what I think?

1365
01:05:18.833 --> 01:05:21.042
I've read your book. remember?

1366
01:05:21.167 --> 01:05:22.792
This is not one
of your mysteries.

1367
01:05:22.875 --> 01:05:24.125
I can explain.

1368
01:05:24.208 --> 01:05:25.833
You leaked the stories
about Mia and Ian.

1369
01:05:25.917 --> 01:05:27.667
Can you blame me?

1370
01:05:27.792 --> 01:05:29.542
You've been inside
that hell house. Gabby.

1371
01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:31.833
You said you love Justice.

1372
01:05:31.917 --> 01:05:33.333
And I do.

1373
01:05:33.458 --> 01:05:34.292
What happened to Mia?

1374
01:05:34.375 --> 01:05:36.167
The story was about to come out.

1375
01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:37.875
I thought she might
wanna get outta there.

1376
01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:44.250
Hudson. did you hurt Mia?

1377
01:05:44.333 --> 01:05:46.083
Hurt her?

1378
01:05:46.167 --> 01:05:48.500
Gabby. she was the only one
actually caring for my daughter.

1379
01:05:48.583 --> 01:05:50.750
The only one that I could
get any information from

1380
01:05:50.875 --> 01:05:51.792
except for what I
could get from Justice

1381
01:05:51.875 --> 01:05:53.125
in between cocktails.

1382
01:05:53.208 --> 01:05:55.625
I was only trying to
protect my daughter.

1383
01:05:58.708 --> 01:05:59.500
[Willow] Help!

1384
01:05:59.583 --> 01:06:00.458
Daddy. Daddy.

1385
01:06:03.042 --> 01:06:04.042
No! Dad. Dad.

1386
01:06:05.958 --> 01:06:07.958
[Willow yells]

1387
01:06:08.042 --> 01:06:09.917
Drop the girl!

1388

[gunshots blast]

[Willow crying]
[tires squeal]

1391
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.958
Okay. okay. okay. All right.

1392
01:06:26.042 --> 01:06:30.458
[Hudson breathes heavily]
[Willow cries]

1393
01:06:36.375 --> 01:06:39.500
[Justice] I'm so
sorry I wasn't here.

1394
01:06:39.542 --> 01:06:41.667
How could you let
this happen. Justice?

1395
01:06:41.667 --> 01:06:43.375
Me?

1396
01:06:43.458 --> 01:06:44.958
Thank God Ian told me
where you all were.

1397
01:06:45.042 --> 01:06:46.542
so we got here in time.

1398
01:06:46.625 --> 01:06:47.917
I told you not to let her
out of the house. Hudson.

1399
01:06:48.042 --> 01:06:50.333
You weren't even there.
You were out with her.

1400
01:06:50.417 --> 01:06:51.750
Stop it.

1401
01:06:51.833 --> 01:06:54.500
[slow somber music]

1402
01:06:58.125 --> 01:07:02.000
Okay. we've got an
APB out on the van.

1403
01:07:02.083 --> 01:07:04.167
Shame you didn't get the
plates. Are you slipping. Gries?

1404
01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:06.083
My concern was for Willow.

1405
01:07:06.167 --> 01:07:08.625
Well of course. because
that is your job.

1406
01:07:08.708 --> 01:07:12.000
Until we catch the guy. I
suggest you all stay together.

1407
01:07:12.083 --> 01:07:14.167
No changes in your
schedule. You got it?

1408
01:07:14.208 --> 01:07:15.417
Well. that's gonna be tough

1409
01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:17.042
because we got a
big show coming up.

1410
01:07:17.125 --> 01:07:19.167
Well. if I were you.

1411
01:07:19.208 --> 01:07:23.000
I would advise her that
she has a choice to make.

1412
01:07:23.083 --> 01:07:25.750
[soft somber music]

1413
01:07:31.708 --> 01:07:36.125
Oh my goodness. We've gotta
stop meeting like this. Nanny.

1414
01:07:37.292 --> 01:07:38.375
Baby girl. we're going home.

1415
01:07:39.625 --> 01:07:41.167
You're kidding me.

1416
01:07:41.250 --> 01:07:42.667
You think you're safe in
that Hollywood hell house?

1417
01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:44.625
My daughter was almost
kidnapped. Justice.

1418
01:07:44.708 --> 01:07:46.542
That was the same
woman from the party.

1419
01:07:46.625 --> 01:07:47.958
It was just an insane fan.

1420
01:07:48.042 --> 01:07:49.708
And who was driving
the van. Damian? Who?

1421
01:07:49.792 --> 01:07:51.208
This is your fault.

1422
01:07:51.292 --> 01:07:53.125
This is my fault?

1423
01:07:53.208 --> 01:07:55.292
This is your entire
life. Justice.

1424
01:07:55.375 --> 01:07:58.875
You know. I used to think that
if I let this phase play out

1425
01:07:58.958 --> 01:08:00.667
with Ian. maybe
someday you and I

1426
01:08:00.667 --> 01:08:02.667
might be able to
have something again.

1427
01:08:02.792 --> 01:08:06.833
But that isn't real.
because nothing is for you.

1428
01:08:06.917 --> 01:08:08.667
You will be hearing
from my lawyers.

1429
01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:09.583
Dad?

1430
01:08:11.458 --> 01:08:12.708
Hey. I love you sweetie. Okay?

1431
01:08:14.875 --> 01:08:16.333
And your mother's
right for once.

1432
01:08:16.417 --> 01:08:18.958
There's more security
at her house. Okay?

1433
01:08:19.042 --> 01:08:21.708
[soft somber music]

1434
01:08:31.417 --> 01:08:33.875
I am so sorry. This
is all my fault.

1435
01:08:33.958 --> 01:08:36.125
I. I shouldn't have let him
take her. I shouldn't have come.

1436
01:08:36.208 --> 01:08:37.458
I should have called Damian.

1437
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
You don't need to
fire me. I'll quit.

1438
01:08:41.042 --> 01:08:42.042
What?

1439
01:08:42.167 --> 01:08:43.125
But you promised.

1440
01:08:43.208 --> 01:08:45.250
Willow. I'm so sorry.

1441
01:08:45.375 --> 01:08:46.500
I thought I could do this.

1442
01:08:46.583 --> 01:08:48.375
but with everything
that's happened.

1443
01:08:48.458 --> 01:08:50.833
I couldn't bear to put
you in more danger.

1444
01:08:50.917 --> 01:08:54.500
Gabby. [cries]

1445
01:08:54.583 --> 01:08:56.125
Come here.

1446
01:08:56.208 --> 01:08:56.833
It's okay.

1447
01:08:59.375 --> 01:09:00.750
Thank you. for
saving my daughter.

1448
01:09:03.042 --> 01:09:03.583

Hey. Gabby.

1454
01:09:29.667 --> 01:09:31.208

wanna talk to you.

Peter? What are you doing here?

1458
01:09:40.583 --> 01:09:43.125
I came to see you. You
think I can come in?

[Gabby breathing heavily]

1460
01:09:44.417 --> 01:09:45.667
It's kind of late.

1461
01:09:45.792 --> 01:09:46.917
Hannah. no.

1462
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.625
Wait. wait. wait. wait.

1463
01:09:48.708 --> 01:09:50.167
Let me in. let me in.

1464
01:09:50.208 --> 01:09:51.167
He's a stalker.

1465
01:09:51.208 --> 01:09:52.375
Open the door.

1466
01:09:52.458 --> 01:09:54.042
Get out. Get out.
Get out.

1467
01:09:54.042 --> 01:09:56.375
Come on! Open up the door.

1468
01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:57.833

[Hannah breathes heavily]

1474
01:10:13.167 --> 01:10:13.708
He's dead.

1475
01:10:16.833 --> 01:10:19.167
I followed him from Hudson's.

1476
01:10:20.333 --> 01:10:21.458
I'll call the police.

1477
01:10:24.458 --> 01:10:28.292
[Hannah gasping and crying]

1478

[sniffles] I'm so stupid.

1479

How did I not know this?

1480
01:10:46.083 --> 01:10:47.458
You're not stupid. Hannah.

1481
01:10:50.458 --> 01:10:53.833
[sniffles] He just
came to set one day

1482
01:10:53.917 --> 01:10:56.792
and started flirting with me.

1483
01:10:56.875 --> 01:10:58.500
I guess to get to you.

1484
01:10:59.917 --> 01:11:01.500
He was so charming.

1485
01:11:02.833 --> 01:11:04.500
I'm just glad it's over.

1486
01:11:04.583 --> 01:11:05.333
Look at me.

1487
01:11:06.708 --> 01:11:07.625
You're okay now.

[soft somber music]

1489
01:11:12.958 --> 01:11:16.167
I don't get it. What
did he want with you?

1490
01:11:16.250 --> 01:11:17.375
I have no idea.

1491
01:11:24.083 --> 01:11:25.667
Who are you calling?

1492
01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:27.792
Justice. I have to tell her
what happened last night.

1493
01:11:30.458 --> 01:11:32.000
Won't Damian tell her?

1494
01:11:33.542 --> 01:11:35.750
I don't know. He has
a lot of secrets.

1495
01:11:37.292 --> 01:11:38.667
They all do. even
from each other.

1496

Okay. I have to go.

1497
01:11:44.375 --> 01:11:47.833
Just. stay here and make
sure you lock all the doors.

No more strange men.

a man again. ever in my life.

[sniffles] Be careful.

1504

Why are you here?
I thought you quit.

1508

Are you alone? Where's Damian?

1509
01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:45.875
He's with Willow. Can't risk
anything happening to her.

1510
01:12:45.958 --> 01:12:47.375
Couldn't live with myself.

1511
01:12:47.458 --> 01:12:48.958
He told me about what
happened with you last night.

1512
01:12:49.042 --> 01:12:50.583
and I'm so sorry.

1513
01:12:50.708 --> 01:12:52.667
You know. your mom was right.

1514
01:12:52.708 --> 01:12:54.583
She always said that
I was a mess. and...

1515
01:12:57.042 --> 01:12:59.583
She was an incredible
lady. You know that. right?

1516
01:12:59.667 --> 01:13:01.208
- Yeah.
- Strong.

1517
01:13:01.333 --> 01:13:04.042
Independent. just like you.

1518
01:13:04.167 --> 01:13:05.750
But hey. the show must go on.

1519
01:13:07.125 --> 01:13:08.875
I just wanted to
give this to you.

1520
01:13:08.958 --> 01:13:10.708
I thought you should
know everything.

1521
01:13:10.833 --> 01:13:11.542
What is it?

1522
01:13:13.667 --> 01:13:16.083
Mia was using this
to talk to Hudson.

1523
01:13:16.208 --> 01:13:18.625
He was the one who leaked
the stories about her and Ian

1524
01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:19.750
to the tabloids.

1525
01:13:21.042 --> 01:13:22.667
Can't blame him for it.

1526
01:13:22.750 --> 01:13:23.875
I would've done the same.

1527
01:13:29.458 --> 01:13:32.208
[Justice sighs]

1528
01:13:32.375 --> 01:13:33.500
He's a good man.

1529
01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:42.333
A good father. Too good for me.

1530
01:13:42.417 --> 01:13:44.000
No. stop.

1531
01:13:44.083 --> 01:13:47.667
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.

1532
01:13:47.708 --> 01:13:50.083
You don't give
yourself enough credit.

1533
01:13:50.167 --> 01:13:52.292
I feel like I'm holding
the weight of the world

1534
01:13:52.375 --> 01:13:53.375
on my shoulders.

1535
01:13:55.042 --> 01:13:58.792
And at any moment. cracks
will start to show.

1536
01:14:01.542 --> 01:14:04.167
Did you know I haven't had a
real hit since Willow was born?

1537
01:14:05.708 --> 01:14:07.917
Hudson left me because
I was so selfish.

1538
01:14:09.708 --> 01:14:10.875
It's not what you think it is.

1539
01:14:13.958 --> 01:14:16.667
You finally get what
you always wanted.

1540
01:14:16.792 --> 01:14:18.042
what you always dreamed about.

1541
01:14:19.958 --> 01:14:20.917
And once you have it.

1542
01:14:24.208 --> 01:14:25.083
you can hardly stand it.

1543
01:14:26.542 --> 01:14:27.792
Some days I.

1544
01:14:29.292 --> 01:14:31.125
I wanna run screaming
into the streets

1545
01:14:31.208 --> 01:14:32.833
and make it all go away.

1546
01:14:34.625 --> 01:14:38.917
But I can't. because too
many people depend on me.

1547
01:14:39.542 --> 01:14:40.583
I'm Jay Gray.

1548
01:14:42.417 --> 01:14:43.417
I'm a star.

1549
01:14:46.625 --> 01:14:49.792
Once that star starts to fade.

1550
01:14:49.875 --> 01:14:53.500
you try everything in your
power to hold onto it.

1551
01:14:53.583 --> 01:14:56.958
I did one. one stupid
interview on a couch with Ian.

1552
01:14:58.542 --> 01:15:01.083
and all of a sudden.
people cared again.

1553
01:15:01.208 --> 01:15:04.542
And now everything is
wrapped up in this fake show.

1554
01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:07.542
that I hate.

1555
01:15:08.542 --> 01:15:09.750
So it's all just a show?

1556
01:15:09.833 --> 01:15:11.542
Everything.

1557
01:15:11.625 --> 01:15:14.708
You can be standing in a
room with thousands of people

1558
01:15:16.333 --> 01:15:20.458
and still feel like
you're all alone.

1559
01:15:21.875 --> 01:15:25.583
You have Willow. And
Justice. you have me.

1560
01:15:25.667 --> 01:15:28.125
You quit. Remember?

1561
01:15:28.208 --> 01:15:30.000
Okay. so what if I come back?

1562
01:15:30.125 --> 01:15:30.875
Would you?

1563
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:32.833
Yes.

1564
01:15:35.375 --> 01:15:36.875
Yes.

1565
01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Believe it or not. as
insane as this has all been.

1566
01:15:41.083 --> 01:15:44.333
I do care for you.
and I care for Willow.

1567
01:15:44.458 --> 01:15:46.833
and I think my mom was wrong.

1568
01:15:48.958 --> 01:15:50.042
You're not a mess.

1569
01:15:52.042 --> 01:15:53.458
You're Jay Gray.

1570
01:15:53.542 --> 01:15:54.292
- That's right.
- Yeah.

1571
01:15:54.375 --> 01:15:54.917
- I am.
- Yes.

1572
01:15:57.833 --> 01:15:59.792
Mm.

1573
01:15:59.875 --> 01:16:04.292
Okay. Jay Gray. you've got this.

1574
01:16:04.375 --> 01:16:05.667
Yeah.

1575
01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:06.792
Let's give them
a hell of a show.

1576
01:16:06.875 --> 01:16:08.000
Yes.

1577
01:16:08.083 --> 01:16:10.500
â™ª Oh. oh. oh. oh

Hannah?

1620
01:19:25.750 --> 01:19:27.250
[Hannah] Gabby. I
had to call you.

1621
01:19:27.375 --> 01:19:29.333
I just read that Samara's
death was ruled a murder.

1622
01:19:29.417 --> 01:19:31.000
not a suicide.

1623
01:19:31.042 --> 01:19:32.000
What? I'm at the show.

1624
01:19:32.083 --> 01:19:34.500
[Hannah] Samara was murdered!

1625
01:19:34.542 --> 01:19:36.042
What? By who?

1626
01:19:36.042 --> 01:19:37.167
[Hannah] Police don't know.

1627
01:19:37.208 --> 01:19:39.042
It just says her
body was planted

1628
01:19:39.042 --> 01:19:42.208
to make it look like a
suicide. total scandal.

1629
01:19:42.292 --> 01:19:44.333
Look. I didn't want
to say it before.

1630
01:19:44.375 --> 01:19:46.667
but you gotta get
away from that family.

1631
01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:49.333
The fame is not worth it.

1632
01:19:49.417 --> 01:19:51.708
Hey. real quick. did you take
the earrings I loaned you

1633
01:19:51.708 --> 01:19:53.125
when you left?

1634
01:19:53.250 --> 01:19:54.333
- What do mean--
- You know. the blue ones?

1635
01:19:54.458 --> 01:19:55.917
Why would you ask me
about those earrings?

1636
01:19:56.042 --> 01:19:57.000
[Hannah] Because I want to
wear them for an audition.

1637
01:19:57.125 --> 01:19:59.250
I thought maybe that. you know.

1638
01:19:59.333 --> 01:20:01.208
Damian took them
when he came over

1639
01:20:01.333 --> 01:20:02.333
to get some stuff for you.
- What?

1640
01:20:02.417 --> 01:20:03.208
He was in our house. Hannah?

1641
01:20:05.208 --> 01:20:07.292
[Hannah] Yeah. he came by to
pick up some of your stuff.

1642
01:20:08.625 --> 01:20:11.000
â™ª I'll hold your hand

1643
01:20:11.083 --> 01:20:13.333
â™ª You'll be all right

1644
01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:16.875
[Hannah] Uh. I thought Damian
took them when he came over.

I know what you did.

1648
01:20:24.208 --> 01:20:26.042
You go to the police
and she's dead.

[Vernon] What?

1663
01:21:07.542 --> 01:21:08.750

Don't. no. Damian

He said you wanted to
hurt me and my mom.

She tried to grab Willow.
I'm taking her to the police.

He's lying.

1730

Where's Willow?

1731
01:23:53.833 --> 01:23:55.250
She's in my room and she's safe.

No. she's not.
Neither of you are.

Oh. please don't listen to her.

1735

How do you think the
attackers got in?

1736
01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:03.083
How do you think they know
where Willow's room was?

1737
01:24:03.167 --> 01:24:05.000
Everything started
when she showed up.

1738
01:24:05.083 --> 01:24:06.792
He killed Mia.

1739
01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:08.167
What?

will do anything to be you.

1747

even kill you.

1748
01:24:27.542 --> 01:24:29.167
I didn't hurt anyone.

1749
01:24:29.250 --> 01:24:32.375
It was him. Justice. you
were never in danger.

1750
01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:34.792
He just wanted you to feel that
way. so you would need him.

1751
01:24:34.875 --> 01:24:36.083
He's obsessed.

1752
01:24:36.167 --> 01:24:38.167
I am the only one who
can keep her safe!

1753
01:24:38.250 --> 01:24:40.792
And I'm the only one
that was here for her!

1754
01:24:40.875 --> 01:24:43.083
All the time! The whole time!

1755
01:24:43.167 --> 01:24:43.708
You're sick.

1756
01:24:44.875 --> 01:24:45.708
Damian.

1757
01:24:49.333 --> 01:24:52.458
You. you know how much
I've done to protect you.

1758
01:24:53.958 --> 01:24:56.375
your career. how much
I have sacrificed.

1759
01:24:58.292 --> 01:25:01.542
Everything that you have around
here is. is 'cause of me.

1760
01:25:03.333 --> 01:25:07.042
Me. and I'm. I'm the
only one that you need.

1761
01:25:09.208 --> 01:25:12.167
And you got all these. these
skinny losers that come in.

1762
01:25:12.250 --> 01:25:15.333
one after another. after
another. and they leave.

1763
01:25:15.458 --> 01:25:16.833
And I stay!

1764
01:25:16.917 --> 01:25:20.417
It just. I. I just thought
that the person under your roof

1765
01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:21.833
would be the one that
you would go for.

1766
01:25:21.958 --> 01:25:24.042
the one who's been here for
you when they all leave.

1767
01:25:24.125 --> 01:25:28.208
And. she's. she's
gonna destroy that.

1768

[Gabby gasps]

1769
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.583
No. Damian. give me the gun.

1770
01:25:32.583 --> 01:25:36.083
No. Ms. Grayce. no. no.
You need me to protect you.

1771
01:25:36.167 --> 01:25:37.333
You need me to protect you.

1772
01:25:37.417 --> 01:25:38.333
I'm the only one that can do it

1773
01:25:38.417 --> 01:25:39.917
because they're gonna hurt you.

1774
01:25:40.042 --> 01:25:42.833
Every single one of
them is gonna hurt you.

1775
01:25:42.875 --> 01:25:44.750
No. No one's gonna hurt me.

1776
01:25:47.625 --> 01:25:50.000
Now. give me the gun.

1777
01:25:50.083 --> 01:25:53.625

Ms. Grayce. I am
Detective Rhodes

1795
01:26:32.542 --> 01:26:35.208
and I'd like to apologize
to you and your family.

1796
01:26:35.333 --> 01:26:38.083
Damian was once a
really good man.

1797
01:26:38.167 --> 01:26:41.417
Some people just can't
handle celebrity.

1798
01:26:41.542 --> 01:26:44.000
We will be back in the morning
to get your statements.

1799
01:26:44.042 --> 01:26:45.542
So please accept my apology.

1800
01:26:46.708 --> 01:26:47.667
Thank you.

Goodnight.

1802
01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.208
He's gone. baby.

1803
01:26:51.333 --> 01:26:53.667
I am just so happy
that you guys are okay.

1804
01:26:53.708 --> 01:26:55.833
And. I've got something
you're never gonna believe.

1805
01:26:55.917 --> 01:26:58.292
Because of all the
commotion at the concert.

1806
01:26:58.375 --> 01:27:00.333
you guys started trending.

1807
01:27:00.417 --> 01:27:02.167
I mean. now "Ride or
Die" has been downloaded

1808
01:27:02.250 --> 01:27:04.208
more in one hour than
any song in history.

1809
01:27:04.333 --> 01:27:06.958
It's a hit. You guys
are back on top.

1810
01:27:07.042 --> 01:27:08.958
Oh. that's incredible. mate.

1811
01:27:09.042 --> 01:27:11.167

01:27:12.875 --> 01:27:13.667
Hey. Nanny.

1814
01:27:15.542 --> 01:27:17.500
I just wanna say thank you for
looking after my friend here.

1815
01:27:17.583 --> 01:27:18.917
all right?

1816
01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.917
I'm not sure what I
would've done without her.

1817
01:27:21.042 --> 01:27:21.708
We're friends?

1818
01:27:21.792 --> 01:27:23.292
Of course.

1819
01:27:23.375 --> 01:27:24.792
We're like the same
person. you and me.

Yeah?

1822
01:27:27.542 --> 01:27:28.750
Besides you're one
hell of a star.

[gentle melancholic music]

1825
01:27:38.875 --> 01:27:42.875
By the way. uh. can I still
stay in the guest bedroom?

1826
01:27:42.958 --> 01:27:44.208
[laughs] No.

1827
01:27:46.792 --> 01:27:47.792
Hey.

1828
01:27:47.875 --> 01:27:48.875

Hi. Who should I
make this out to?

1836
01:28:07.042 --> 01:28:08.792

â™ª The skies have gone dark

â™ª Your world's falling apart

â™ª So I bought two
tickets tonight â™ª

1853
01:29:02.375 --> 01:29:04.500
â™ª To anywhere but here

1854
01:29:04.583 --> 01:29:07.250
â™ª Let's up and disappear

1855
01:29:07.375 --> 01:29:11.958
â™ª Leave this dusty
old valley behind â™ª

1856
01:29:13.208 --> 01:29:15.875
â™ª Got nothing to be afraid of

1857
01:29:15.958 --> 01:29:20.708
â™ª If you wait one more
day. nothing will change â™ª

1858
01:29:22.708 --> 01:29:25.875
â™ª Wanna find out
what you're made of â™ª

â™ª Let's break away
and hit the highway â™ª

1862
01:29:41.167 --> 01:29:44.500

â™ª Baby let's fly

1867
01:30:02.167 --> 01:30:07.042
â™ª There's nothing here but
pain and more of the same â™ª

01:30:07.542 --> 01:30:11.917
â™ª Keeping both feet
on the ground. Ill listen â™ª
