a high-profile client.

530
00:26:03.042 --> 00:26:04.667
That was my ex-husband.

531
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:05.875
Huge pain in my ass.

532
00:26:07.417 --> 00:26:10.000
I used to love that
son of a bitch.

533
00:26:10.083 --> 00:26:12.167
and I know he cares
a lot about us.

534
00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:13.750
which is what drives me crazy.

535
00:26:13.833 --> 00:26:14.667
Mm.

536
00:26:15.625 --> 00:26:16.875
But what about Ian?

537
00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:23.042
Ian's. Ian's hot. he's young.
He's good for my career.

538
00:26:24.583 --> 00:26:26.167
But you don't love him?

539
00:26:26.208 --> 00:26:29.750
Love. love. Let's just say
we have an understanding.

540
00:26:29.833 --> 00:26:33.417
Like me. Hudson did not know I
was getting engaged on stage.

541
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.875
Of course the fans wanna see
you two get married. Okay?

- The press eating this up.

You're all over the tabloids.

545
00:26:39.958 --> 00:26:41.167
Yeah. well so. we can do
something in private then. yeah?

546
00:26:41.208 --> 00:26:44.083
This is insane. We don't
even have the same fans.

547
00:26:44.167 --> 00:26:45.833
And why would we do
something in private

548
00:26:45.875 --> 00:26:48.167
if we're doing it for
the public anyway. right?

549
00:26:48.208 --> 00:26:51.417
New fans is exactly the
idea. for both of you.

550
00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:53.792
They'd like to see you guys
together. more for everyone.

551

Okay. Just picture it.

552

We'll start off
with the classics.

553
00:26:56.625 --> 00:26:57.708
and then we can
go to the new song

554
00:26:57.792 --> 00:26:58.542

- Yeah. yeah. whatever.

555
00:26:58.667 --> 00:26:59.833
We'll figure it out.

556
00:26:59.875 --> 00:27:03.000
But please. both of
you. no more surprises.

557

trust me on this. Mm-ah.

this interview tonight.

would make something to eat

567

for Willow.

568
00:27:27.875 --> 00:27:29.875

so. we're adapting.

569
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.125
Sure. I make a mean quesadilla.

570
00:27:31.208 --> 00:27:33.542
Oh. no. no. No cheese.
not in this house.

571
00:27:33.625 --> 00:27:35.000
Cheese. bad. Got it.

572
00:27:35.083 --> 00:27:36.500
If that's everything.
I'll just go unpack.

573
00:27:36.542 --> 00:27:38.083
Well actually. there's
one more thing.

574
00:27:38.208 --> 00:27:40.458
We're having this little
get together here tomorrow

575
00:27:40.542 --> 00:27:42.375
and Willow is
staying at her dad's.

576
00:27:42.458 --> 00:27:43.917
Oh. so you don't need me then?

577
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.167
Well. actually I was
hoping you wanted to come.

578
00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:47.750
Oh. thanks.

579
00:27:47.833 --> 00:27:49.708
Um. I was thinking I could
use that time to write though.

580
00:27:49.792 --> 00:27:51.750
With Willow and Hudson--

581
00:27:51.833 --> 00:27:53.917
Can I be honest with you?
It's kind of important.

582
00:27:54.042 --> 00:27:56.250
And with all the staff
being fired. I have no one.

583
00:27:57.417 --> 00:27:59.583
I could really use your help.

584
00:27:59.667 --> 00:28:03.667
Okay. Yeah. Um. it'll
be fun. I guess.

585

00:59:31.042 --> 00:59:32.125
No.

1234
00:59:32.208 --> 00:59:34.083
Rhodes. where are
we going with this?

1235
00:59:34.167 --> 00:59:36.083
What are you suggesting?

1236
00:59:36.167 --> 00:59:37.833
Nothing yet.

1237
00:59:37.917 --> 00:59:40.500
It appears to be a suicide.
so for now. we're done.

1238
00:59:40.583 --> 00:59:42.667
But don't go anywhere. Nanny.

1239
00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:44.292
I think I might have some
more questions for you.

1240
00:59:44.375 --> 00:59:44.958
Uh?

1241
00:59:46.292 --> 00:59:47.083
[Damian] Rhodes.

1242
00:59:50.292 --> 00:59:51.750
I'm gonna take her home.

1243
00:59:51.833 --> 00:59:52.375
I'll let you know if I
have any more information

1244
00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:53.583
later tonight. okay?

1245
00:59:53.667 --> 00:59:54.417
I'm just trying to do my job.

1246
00:59:54.542 --> 00:59:55.625
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1247
00:59:57.583 --> 00:59:59.458
Hey. Gabby. I'll take you home.

1248
00:59:59.542 --> 01:00:00.542
Yeah.

1249
01:00:03.125 --> 01:00:04.500
Thank you.

1250
01:00:04.625 --> 01:00:07.708
[gentle somber music]

1251
01:00:09.375 --> 01:00:12.750
[computer keys clicking]

1252
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:16.625
Willow!

1253
01:00:16.708 --> 01:00:17.625
Hudson. hey. What--

1254
01:00:17.708 --> 01:00:18.958
Where's Willow?

1255
01:00:19.042 --> 01:00:20.083
You didn't think to tell
me about the shooting

1256
01:00:20.208 --> 01:00:21.667
at my daughter's
house the other night?

1257
01:00:21.833 --> 01:00:23.500
I had to hear that from
Willow. She called me crying.

1258
01:00:23.542 --> 01:00:24.333
Willow!

1259
01:00:24.417 --> 01:00:25.667
Justice told me--

1260
01:00:25.667 --> 01:00:27.292
Told you not to tell
me? Of course she did.

1261
01:00:27.375 --> 01:00:28.833
Of course she did. Willow.

1262
01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:31.000
Hey. go pack your stuff. You're
gonna come with me. okay?

1263
01:00:31.125 --> 01:00:31.625
Okay.

1264
01:00:31.708 --> 01:00:33.375
Well. wait. no.

1265
01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:33.875
Willow's supposed
to be with me--

1266
01:00:34.042 --> 01:00:35.167
I am her father!

1267
01:00:35.208 --> 01:00:37.000
She is coming with
me. Willow. go.

1268
01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:39.792
Oh look. it's Super Dad.

1269
01:00:39.875 --> 01:00:41.208
How goes it. mate?
What are you doing?

1270
01:00:41.333 --> 01:00:42.708
Go take another drink
and don't worry about it.

1271
01:00:42.792 --> 01:00:44.667
Oh. a little hostile. aren't we?

1272
01:00:44.792 --> 01:00:46.500
No. what's hostile
is this environment.

1273
01:00:46.542 --> 01:00:47.875
And that party that you
threw the other night

1274
01:00:47.958 --> 01:00:49.667
that almost got Justice killed.

1275
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:50.708
Oh. you told him?

1276
01:00:50.792 --> 01:00:52.542
She didn't have to tell me.

1277
01:00:52.625 --> 01:00:53.875
I'm taking Willow.

1278
01:00:53.958 --> 01:00:54.792
Well. you can go
ahead and try mate.

1279
01:00:54.875 --> 01:00:55.917
but you gotta get past this.

1280
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.542
You gonna stop me?
Man of the house.

1281
01:00:57.625 --> 01:00:59.167
I got people for that. mate.

1282
01:00:59.208 --> 01:01:00.833
Oh yeah? Where's Damian?

1283
01:01:00.917 --> 01:01:02.417
With Justice. now why don't
you back up a little bit.

1284
01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:03.417
[fist thuds]

1285
01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:05.250
- Hudson!
- Dad!

1286
01:01:05.375 --> 01:01:06.625
Oh. okay.

1287
01:01:06.708 --> 01:01:08.000
I'm gonna sue your ass.

1288
01:01:08.125 --> 01:01:10.042
Wouldn't be very rockstar
of you. now would it?

1289
01:01:11.542 --> 01:01:12.292
Gabby. you coming?

1290
01:01:12.375 --> 01:01:13.583
Yeah.

1291
01:01:13.667 --> 01:01:16.958
[deep foreboding music]

1292
01:01:25.708 --> 01:01:28.125
[birds chirp]

1293
01:01:29.708 --> 01:01:31.333
Oh. Gabby. come
look at our fish.

1294
01:01:31.417 --> 01:01:32.958
Aw.

1295
01:01:32.958 --> 01:01:34.417
Hey. kiddo. why
don't you go play

1296
01:01:34.542 --> 01:01:36.542
while I get Gabby
settled. all right?

1297
01:01:36.625 --> 01:01:37.833
Okay.

1298
01:01:37.917 --> 01:01:39.042
Willow. backpack.

1299
01:01:40.208 --> 01:01:41.667
Thank you. Bye. Gabby.

1300
01:01:44.417 --> 01:01:45.208
[Gabby] Wow.

1301
01:01:46.958 --> 01:01:48.750
[Hudson] Welcome
to my house. Gabby.

1302
01:01:48.833 --> 01:01:50.042
It's like an oasis.

1303
01:01:53.208 --> 01:01:54.750
I'm sorry about what
happened with Ian.

1304
01:01:54.875 --> 01:01:56.000
Thank you for coming.

1305
01:01:57.375 --> 01:02:00.542
For the record. I voted to
tell you. about the attacks.

1306
01:02:00.625 --> 01:02:01.667
I just don't want my
daughter at that house

1307
01:02:01.792 --> 01:02:03.125
without security.

1308
01:02:03.208 --> 01:02:04.208
You guys can hang out
here during the day.

1309
01:02:04.292 --> 01:02:06.042
Damian's looking into it.

1310
01:02:06.167 --> 01:02:09.500
I just hate that you had to
find out the way you did.

1311
01:02:09.583 --> 01:02:11.250
It's just scary not
knowing what's happening

1312
01:02:11.333 --> 01:02:12.833
with Willow and Justice.

1313
01:02:12.917 --> 01:02:14.708
You care about her
a lot. don't you?

1314
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:17.167
Of course. she's my daughter.

1315
01:02:17.208 --> 01:02:20.042
I meant Justice. I've
seen you two together.

1316
01:02:23.417 --> 01:02:24.083
That's complicated.

1317
01:02:26.875 --> 01:02:29.583
Justice and I split up because
it seemed like her career

1318
01:02:29.667 --> 01:02:31.500
was more important
than her family.

1319
01:02:31.583 --> 01:02:34.208
But I was stupid. she supported
me when I was on my way up.

1320
01:02:34.333 --> 01:02:36.917
and I wasn't there for her
when she needed me the most.

1321
01:02:38.208 --> 01:02:40.000
She just got so
big. so fast that.

1322
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.458
it was a bit overwhelming.

1323
01:02:43.542 --> 01:02:44.208
So I left.

1324
01:02:45.375 --> 01:02:46.583
even though I still love her.

1325
01:02:46.667 --> 01:02:47.833
Then why aren't
you all together?

1326
01:02:47.917 --> 01:02:49.792
Why all the secrets?

1327
01:02:49.875 --> 01:02:50.667
She just has to keep
playing this Hollywood game

1328
01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:52.167
to stay on top.

1329
01:02:52.208 --> 01:02:54.125
And sadly. I can tell
that it's crushing her.

1330
01:02:54.917 --> 01:02:56.833
She's a strong woman.

1331
01:02:56.875 --> 01:02:58.500
Maybe if she knew someone
really cared about her.

1332
01:02:58.625 --> 01:03:00.833
she wouldn't need
all the charade.

1333
01:03:00.917 --> 01:03:03.042
But I mean. what do I
know? I'm just a nanny.

1334
01:03:03.125 --> 01:03:04.708
You know Gabby. I didn't
know what to feel about you

1335
01:03:04.792 --> 01:03:05.833
when I first met you.

1336
01:03:07.083 --> 01:03:08.708
but Willow absolutely loves you.

1337
01:03:08.792 --> 01:03:11.000
and you are a terrific writer.

1338
01:03:12.208 --> 01:03:13.333
You read my book?

1339
01:03:13.375 --> 01:03:15.208
I did. It's good.

1340
01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:18.333
I have notes. but. I think
you might have something.

1341
01:03:18.375 --> 01:03:20.042
In fact. if you wanna
look over those notes

1342
01:03:20.125 --> 01:03:22.208
while me and Willow hang out?

1343
01:03:22.333 --> 01:03:25.292
Yes. that would be
amazing. Thank you.

1344
01:03:25.375 --> 01:03:26.292
Of course.

1345
01:03:32.208 --> 01:03:34.500
[Gabby sighs]

1346
01:03:34.542 --> 01:03:37.000
This view is spectacular.

1347
01:03:37.125 --> 01:03:39.125
Believe it or not. this is
the first house that I bought

1348
01:03:39.208 --> 01:03:41.208
after I published my first book.

1349
01:03:41.292 --> 01:03:44.917
Justice and I lived here before
she became a big megastar.

1350
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.417
Willow was born
in this house too.

1351
01:03:48.458 --> 01:03:51.667
Anyway. if you wanna look
over the notes. you can.

1352
01:03:51.708 --> 01:03:54.792
[gentle solemn music]

1353
01:03:58.583 --> 01:04:01.917
[computer keys clicking]

1354
01:04:09.083 --> 01:04:10.792
[low battery alerts]

1355
01:04:10.875 --> 01:04:14.083
[soft mysterious music]

1356
01:04:29.708 --> 01:04:33.083
[mysterious music swells]

1357
01:04:37.125 --> 01:04:40.250
[tense foreboding music]

1358
01:05:04.042 --> 01:05:07.125
[soft dramatic music]

1359
01:05:08.708 --> 01:05:11.167
[banging on door]

1360
01:05:11.250 --> 01:05:13.333
That's not what it looks like.

1361
01:05:13.458 --> 01:05:14.792
Why do you have this?

1362
01:05:14.875 --> 01:05:15.875
To talk to Mia.

1363
01:05:16.875 --> 01:05:17.875
But it's not what you think.

1364
01:05:17.958 --> 01:05:18.708
How do you know what I think?

1365
01:05:18.833 --> 01:05:21.042
I've read your book. remember?

1366
01:05:21.167 --> 01:05:22.792
This is not one
of your mysteries.

1367
01:05:22.875 --> 01:05:24.125
I can explain.

1368
01:05:24.208 --> 01:05:25.833
You leaked the stories
about Mia and Ian.

1369
01:05:25.917 --> 01:05:27.667
Can you blame me?

1370
01:05:27.792 --> 01:05:29.542
You've been inside
that hell house. Gabby.

1371
01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:31.833
You said you love Justice.

1372
01:05:31.917 --> 01:05:33.333
And I do.

1373
01:05:33.458 --> 01:05:34.292
What happened to Mia?

1374
01:05:34.375 --> 01:05:36.167
The story was about to come out.

1375
01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:37.875
I thought she might
wanna get outta there.

1376
01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:44.250
Hudson. did you hurt Mia?

1377
01:05:44.333 --> 01:05:46.083
Hurt her?

1378
01:05:46.167 --> 01:05:48.500
Gabby. she was the only one
actually caring for my daughter.

1379
01:05:48.583 --> 01:05:50.750
The only one that I could
get any information from

1380
01:05:50.875 --> 01:05:51.792
except for what I
could get from Justice

1381
01:05:51.875 --> 01:05:53.125
in between cocktails.

1382
01:05:53.208 --> 01:05:55.625
I was only trying to
protect my daughter.

1383
01:05:58.708 --> 01:05:59.500
[Willow] Help!

1384
01:05:59.583 --> 01:06:00.458
Daddy. Daddy.

1385
01:06:03.042 --> 01:06:04.042
No! Dad. Dad.

1386
01:06:05.958 --> 01:06:07.958
[Willow yells]

1387
01:06:08.042 --> 01:06:09.917
Drop the girl!

1388
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.542
[gunshots blast]

1389
01:06:11.625 --> 01:06:14.917
[bold adventurous music]

1390
01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:22.917
[Willow crying]
[tires squeal]

1391
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.958
Okay. okay. okay. All right.

1392
01:06:26.042 --> 01:06:30.458
[Hudson breathes heavily]
[Willow cries]

1393
01:06:36.375 --> 01:06:39.500
[Justice] I'm so
sorry I wasn't here.

1394
01:06:39.542 --> 01:06:41.667
How could you let
this happen. Justice?

1395
01:06:41.667 --> 01:06:43.375
Me?

1396
01:06:43.458 --> 01:06:44.958
Thank God Ian told me
where you all were.

1397
01:06:45.042 --> 01:06:46.542
so we got here in time.

1398
01:06:46.625 --> 01:06:47.917
I told you not to let her
out of the house. Hudson.

1399
01:06:48.042 --> 01:06:50.333
You weren't even there.
You were out with her.

1400
01:06:50.417 --> 01:06:51.750
Stop it.

1401
01:06:51.833 --> 01:06:54.500
[slow somber music]

1402
01:06:58.125 --> 01:07:02.000
Okay. we've got an
APB out on the van.

1403
01:07:02.083 --> 01:07:04.167
Shame you didn't get the
plates. Are you slipping. Gries?

1404
01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:06.083
My concern was for Willow.

1405
01:07:06.167 --> 01:07:08.625
Well of course. because
that is your job.

1406
01:07:08.708 --> 01:07:12.000
Until we catch the guy. I
suggest you all stay together.

1407
01:07:12.083 --> 01:07:14.167
No changes in your
schedule. You got it?

1408
01:07:14.208 --> 01:07:15.417
Well. that's gonna be tough

1409
01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:17.042
because we got a
big show coming up.

1410
01:07:17.125 --> 01:07:19.167
Well. if I were you.

1411
01:07:19.208 --> 01:07:23.000
I would advise her that
she has a choice to make.

[soft somber music]

1413

Oh my goodness. We've gotta
stop meeting like this. Nanny.

1414
01:07:37.292 --> 01:07:38.375
Baby girl. we're going home.

1415
01:07:39.625 --> 01:07:41.167
You're kidding me.

1416
01:07:41.250 --> 01:07:42.667
You think you're safe in
that Hollywood hell house?

1417
01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:44.625
My daughter was almost
kidnapped. Justice.

1418
01:07:44.708 --> 01:07:46.542
That was the same
woman from the party.

1419
01:07:46.625 --> 01:07:47.958
It was just an insane fan.

1420
01:07:48.042 --> 01:07:49.708
And who was driving
the van. Damian? Who?

1421
01:07:49.792 --> 01:07:51.208
This is your fault.

1422
01:07:51.292 --> 01:07:53.125
This is my fault?

1423
01:07:53.208 --> 01:07:55.292
This is your entire
life. Justice.

1424
01:07:55.375 --> 01:07:58.875
You know. I used to think that
if I let this phase play out

1425
01:07:58.958 --> 01:08:00.667
with Ian. maybe
someday you and I

1426
01:08:00.667 --> 01:08:02.667
might be able to
have something again.

1427
01:08:02.792 --> 01:08:06.833
But that isn't real.
because nothing is for you.

1428
01:08:06.917 --> 01:08:08.667
You will be hearing
from my lawyers.

1429

And your mother's
right for once.

1432
01:08:16.417 --> 01:08:18.958

at her house. Okay?

[soft somber music]

1434
01:08:31.417 --> 01:08:33.875
I am so sorry. This
is all my fault.

1435
01:08:33.958 --> 01:08:36.125
I. I shouldn't have let him
take her. I shouldn't have come.

1436
01:08:36.208 --> 01:08:37.458
I should have called Damian.

1437
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
You don't need to
fire me. I'll quit.

1438
01:08:41.042 --> 01:08:42.042
What?

1439
01:08:42.167 --> 01:08:43.125

1442

but with everything
that's happened.

1443
01:08:48.458 --> 01:08:50.833

you in more danger.

to talk to Hudson.

the stories about her and Ian

you always wanted.

into the streets

1545
01:14:31.208 --> 01:14:32.833
and make it all go away.

1546
01:14:34.625 --> 01:14:38.917

many people depend on me.

Once that star starts to fade.

1550

you try everything in your
power to hold onto it.

1551
01:14:53.583 --> 01:14:56.958
I did one. one stupid
interview on a couch with Ian.

1552
01:14:58.542 --> 01:15:01.083
and all of a sudden.
people cared again.

1553
01:15:01.208 --> 01:15:04.542
And now everything is
wrapped up in this fake show.

1554

1555
01:15:08.542 --> 01:15:09.750

Everything.

1557
01:15:11.625 --> 01:15:14.708

room with thousands of people

1558

and still feel like
you're all alone.

1559

Justice. you have me.

1560

insane as this has all been.

would be the one that
you would go for.

because they're gonna hurt you.

1774

Every single one of
them is gonna hurt you.

1775

Some people just can't
handle celebrity.

And. I've got something
you're never gonna believe.
