00:00:43.419 --> 00:00:46.672

Home.

A woman.

6
00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:56.974
I don’t know
if any of it’s real.

7
00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:59.226
but it has a feeling.

8
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.520
and the feeling’s real.

9
00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:20.873
I’m sorry you’re having
technical difficulties.

10
00:01:20.956 --> 00:01:22.541

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:25.252
Yeah. You know what?
I’m gonna transfer you.

12
00:01:26.337 --> 00:01:27.713
-Hold on.

13
00:01:27.797 --> 00:01:30.132
I’m sorry you’re having
technical difficulties.

14
00:01:30.216 --> 00:01:32.718

16
00:01:42.686 --> 00:01:44.480
-Seriously. what the "F"?

17
00:01:44.563 --> 00:01:46.607
Wittle’s not picking up
his phone again.

18
00:01:55.658 --> 00:01:57.827
-Hi. my love.

19

-My shoulder’s good.

My leg is a little bit achy.
but I’m taking the meds. so...

22
00:02:06.836 --> 00:02:08.712
Enough about me. How are you?

23
00:02:08.796 --> 00:02:10.297
I’m good. I’m good.

24
00:02:10.381 --> 00:02:12.675
Um. I wanted to talk to you
about my graduation.

25
00:02:12.758 --> 00:02:14.552
I can’t believe
you’re graduating.

26
00:02:14.635 --> 00:02:16.136
Can’t believe?

27
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.515
-Really? -Oh. it’s hard
to keep track of the time.

28
00:02:19.598 --> 00:02:23.060
but I’m...
I’m really proud of you.

Well. I want you to come.

00:02:34.405 --> 00:02:36.240
D-Does she want me to come?

35
00:02:36.323 --> 00:02:38.784
I want you to come. Dad.

36
00:02:38.868 --> 00:02:40.744
Well. I wonder if maybe.

37
00:02:40.828 --> 00:02:43.831
if I take you and your brother
out the next day and...

38
00:02:43.914 --> 00:02:45.708
Are-are you not coming

I don’t want to complicate
things with your mom and...

45

I know that I messed up.
and I just want this to be...

46
00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.519
-the focus to be on... Yeah.
-Dad.

47
00:03:07.021 --> 00:03:10.608

I understand. I’ve only
refilled it four times.

103
00:06:18.504 --> 00:06:21.423
You have to count the first one
in the five. sir.

104
00:06:21.507 --> 00:06:24.134
But why... But that wasn’t
a refill. the first one.

Look. uh. I’m gonna
cut to the chase.

Our Indian counterparts
are crushing us.

126
00:08:11.617 --> 00:08:13.202
autobots are screwing us.

127
00:08:13.285 --> 00:08:15.579
-and a lot of this is
because of you. man. -What?

128
00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:16.872
Where’s your head been?

129
00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:21.293
Have you been drawing pictures
of your dream house

130
00:08:21.376 --> 00:08:22.669
instead of answering the phone?

131
00:08:22.753 --> 00:08:24.254
-Is that what that note...
-What time is it?

132
00:08:24.338 --> 00:08:25.380
I’m sorry?

133
00:08:25.464 --> 00:08:27.007
That’s how
you should’ve led this.

134
00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:28.717
You buried the lede. buddy.

135
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.928
We always start with "sorry"
here at Technical Difficulties.

136
00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:35.057
Look. uh. there’s. uh.

137
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.851
no easy way
to tell you this. but...

138
00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:40.270
...you’re fired.

139
00:08:45.609 --> 00:08:47.486

Greg?

141
00:08:57.663 --> 00:09:00.165
The inside of your head
must be amazing.

142
00:09:05.379 --> 00:09:07.965
This is the beginning
of your new life.

143
00:09:26.275 --> 00:09:27.359
Bjorn?

144
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.635
Yo. I’ll be done in a moment!

145
00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:23.915
Is he not here?

146
00:10:23.999 --> 00:10:25.167

00:12:58.445 --> 00:13:00.280
You deflected my powers.

179
00:13:00.363 --> 00:13:01.323
I’m sorry?

180
00:13:01.406 --> 00:13:02.449
Stop apologizing.

181
00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:03.825
I’m not apologizing.

182
00:13:03.909 --> 00:13:05.410
I don’t hear you.

183
00:13:05.494 --> 00:13:07.662
I can’t understand
what you’re saying.

184
00:13:27.849 --> 00:13:30.185
I don’t recognize you.

185
00:13:30.268 --> 00:13:31.770
I-I-I don’t know you.

186
00:13:32.938 --> 00:13:34.898
It’s always blurry at first.

187
00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:36.483
I’m Isabel.

188
00:13:36.566 --> 00:13:37.859
Come sit with me.

189
00:13:37.943 --> 00:13:39.236
I’m-I’m fine.

190
00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:42.405
I’m just gonna have my drink.
Thank you.

191
00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:46.034
You need an alibi. don’t you?

192
00:13:50.539 --> 00:13:52.457
What?

193
00:13:58.129 --> 00:14:00.298
Interesting view.

194
00:14:06.096 --> 00:14:09.808
Your next step is
extremely important.

195
00:14:09.891 --> 00:14:12.727
You do not want to spend
this life in prison.

196
00:14:12.811 --> 00:14:15.730
That would be very. very bad.

197
00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:17.274
Look at me.

198
00:14:17.357 --> 00:14:19.276
I am going to help you because.

199
00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:22.571
personally. I feel a little bit
responsible for your situation.

200
00:14:22.654 --> 00:14:24.447
Why do you feel responsible?

201
00:14:24.531 --> 00:14:27.701
Let’s just say it’s kind of
my fault this world exists.

202
00:14:29.911 --> 00:14:31.162
Don’t worry about it.

203
00:14:31.246 --> 00:14:33.373
It’s gonna be okay.
I’m gonna fix it.

204
00:14:33.456 --> 00:14:35.584
But first. you need to do
something for me.

205
00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:38.003
I have a boyfriend-- an ex.

206
00:14:39.504 --> 00:14:42.674
He’s a real asshole.
and he’s in the bathroom.

207
00:14:42.757 --> 00:14:43.967
Okay.

208
00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:45.760
He has something
that belongs to me.

209
00:14:45.844 --> 00:14:47.887
Are you even listening to me?

210
00:14:47.971 --> 00:14:49.014
Yes.

211
00:14:49.097 --> 00:14:51.349
-About your boyfriend.
-Ex.

212
00:14:51.433 --> 00:14:54.936
He has my amulet necklace.
and I need it back.

213
00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.397
Why can’t you use your powers
on your boyfriend?

214
00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.608
Because he’s real.
like you and I.

215
00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:02.193
You keep saying "real."
What do you mean by "real"?

216
00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:06.615
You see all these people
outside?

217
00:15:06.698 --> 00:15:08.158
They’re not real.

218
00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:11.077
The bartender-- not real.

219
00:15:11.161 --> 00:15:13.413
Nothing. nothing.
nothing of this is real.

220
00:15:13.496 --> 00:15:15.498
There’s very few of us.

221
00:15:15.582 --> 00:15:17.250
I think you need help.

222
00:15:17.334 --> 00:15:20.295
No. you need help.

223
00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:22.005
Get me my necklace.

224
00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:24.841
and I will fix
the problem for you. Greg.

225
00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:27.260
How do you know my name?

226
00:15:27.344 --> 00:15:29.929
I took it from your mind.

227
00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:32.265
I’m just kidding.

228
00:15:32.349 --> 00:15:35.185
The bartender just said it
like a minute ago.

229
00:15:35.268 --> 00:15:36.686
Come on. Greg.

230
00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.481
What have you got to lose?

231
00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:45.278
Why is this necklace
so important?

232
00:15:45.362 --> 00:15:49.074
It contains
special yellow crystals

233
00:15:49.157 --> 00:15:52.952
with the power
to manipulate this fake world.

234
00:16:10.095 --> 00:16:12.013
Well done. That was fast.

235
00:16:12.097 --> 00:16:13.848
Did he give you any trouble?

236
00:16:13.932 --> 00:16:15.558
No. he was just passed out.

237
00:16:15.642 --> 00:16:16.851
Really? Great.

238
00:16:16.935 --> 00:16:18.937
Get back in there
and get the wallet.

239
00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.355
Drinks on him.

240
00:16:20.438 --> 00:16:22.232
No. I can... I got money.

241
00:16:22.315 --> 00:16:23.900
He owes me.

242
00:16:44.921 --> 00:16:47.632
Okay. guapo.

243
00:16:47.716 --> 00:16:49.676
Time to solve your problem.

244
00:16:53.054 --> 00:16:55.265
You deserve a clean break.

245
00:16:55.348 --> 00:16:56.599
Okay.

246
00:16:56.683 --> 00:16:58.601
I’m gonna fix it.

247
00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:23.877
Hey.

248
00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.920
You see this?

249
00:17:28.423 --> 00:17:34.179
The world is simply light
bouncing around your neurons.

250
00:17:34.262 --> 00:17:38.183
It’s manufactured and malleable.

251
00:17:38.266 --> 00:17:40.560
You’re free.

252
00:17:46.733 --> 00:17:49.027
-

253
00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:13.468
He jumped!

254
00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:14.969
-He jumped! He jumped!
-No.

255
00:18:15.053 --> 00:18:16.930
He jumped out of the window!
Right there.

256
00:18:17.013 --> 00:18:18.890
He just fucking
committed suicide

257
00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:21.017
-in the middle of the day!
-What?

258
00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.644
What were you doing in the bar?

259
00:18:22.727 --> 00:18:24.103
Nothing.
I was just getting a snack.

260
00:18:24.187 --> 00:18:26.272
-I was just...
-Let’s go.

261
00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:29.901
-Did you do that?
-Did what?

262
00:18:29.984 --> 00:18:32.153
A dozen witnesses saw him
jump out of the window.

263
00:18:32.237 --> 00:18:34.948
and then saw you walk out
of the bar across the street.

264
00:18:35.031 --> 00:18:37.700
-Convinced yet?

265
00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:41.996
I forgot my wallet.
-

266
00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.040
-Forget about it.
-No. no. I can go back.

267
00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:46.042
-I’m innocent. right?
-You can’t go back.

268
00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:48.878
You have to lay low for a while
till the case closes.

269
00:18:48.962 --> 00:18:50.296
But you said yourself that

270
00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.090
they saw me at the bar--
the witnesses.

271
00:18:52.173 --> 00:18:53.800
-Exactly.
-

272
00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:55.426
Let them do the talking.

273
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:57.762
Last thing you need is
to be in a dark room.

274
00:18:57.846 --> 00:19:01.641
bright light on your face.
with the Five-O tripping you up.

275
00:19:01.724 --> 00:19:04.769
because you will
for sure fuck it up.

276
00:19:04.853 --> 00:19:06.688
Just lay low.

277
00:19:06.771 --> 00:19:08.439
You have a phone?

278
00:19:08.523 --> 00:19:09.816
Yeah. Why?

279
00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:11.442
...inequality
of income and wealth

280
00:19:11.526 --> 00:19:14.237
has surged in recent years.
Protestors are...

281
00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.406
We’ll use science
to shape policy.

282
00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:18.575
Not everyone is convinced.

283
00:19:18.658 --> 00:19:19.951
It doesn’t make any sense.

284
00:19:20.034 --> 00:19:21.411
Bjorn was happy.

285
00:19:21.494 --> 00:19:23.913
He wasn’t depressed.

286
00:19:23.997 --> 00:19:25.373
It’s not possible.

287
00:19:25.456 --> 00:19:27.709
The most likely cause of death
is suicide.

288
00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:31.129
although police have not
ruled out foul play.

289
00:19:31.212 --> 00:19:32.881
Yo. Phone.

290
00:19:38.636 --> 00:19:41.097
Hi. I’m Dad. and this is...

291
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.265
Emily.

292
00:19:42.348 --> 00:19:44.559
And who’s the one on your shirt?

293
00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:47.896
This is... Turtleistic.

294
00:19:47.979 --> 00:19:49.981
That’s perfect.

295
00:19:50.064 --> 00:19:51.608
-That’s great.
- Turtleistic.

296
00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:53.109
-Cute.
- Turtleistic.

297
00:19:53.192 --> 00:19:54.611
-How much for this?

298
00:19:54.694 --> 00:19:57.071
-I’ll give you 60 bucks.
-Done.

299
00:19:57.155 --> 00:19:58.156
ID.

300
00:19:58.239 --> 00:19:59.824
I don’t have a wallet.

301
00:19:59.908 --> 00:20:01.826
I... Can you use yours?

302
00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:03.161
Can she use hers?

303
00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:04.704
40.

304
00:20:07.749 --> 00:20:08.791
Ten.

305
00:20:10.919 --> 00:20:13.338
I mean. better than
tossing it on the trash can.

306
00:20:13.421 --> 00:20:15.506
Oh. for sure.
but they just grind you

307
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.383
on that no-ID thing.

308
00:20:17.467 --> 00:20:19.135
-Did you know that?
-No.

309
00:20:19.218 --> 00:20:22.472
I don’t have a phone.
I’m not that stupid.

310
00:20:31.898 --> 00:20:33.733
-Wh-Where are we going?
-We’re going here.

311
00:20:33.816 --> 00:20:36.527
where you’ll be safe
until the case closes.

312
00:20:46.454 --> 00:20:50.291
Welcome to my home
away from home.

313
00:20:51.626 --> 00:20:52.961
And this is my Ophelia.

314
00:20:53.044 --> 00:20:55.505
It’s okay. baby.

315
00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:58.091
I can’t stay here.

316
00:20:58.174 --> 00:20:59.926
Are you homeless?

317
00:21:01.094 --> 00:21:03.513
Is this legal or...

318
00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:05.890
You know. I really
appreciate your help.

319
00:21:05.974 --> 00:21:08.226
I’m sorry. I think I’m gonna go.

320
00:21:08.309 --> 00:21:09.936
And where are you going?

321
00:21:10.019 --> 00:21:11.521
I’m gonna go home.

322
00:21:11.604 --> 00:21:13.523
Well. I’m staying in a motel.

323
00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:15.108
so I’ll go back
to the motel room.

324
00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:17.068
but I don’t have the key
’cause that’s in my wallet.

325
00:21:17.151 --> 00:21:19.821
but I’ll just... Well. no.
’cause my ID’s there also

326
00:21:19.904 --> 00:21:21.864
and my money.

327
00:21:21.948 --> 00:21:24.033
So I don’t have my ID
or the money.

328
00:21:24.117 --> 00:21:25.743
but maybe they’ll remember me.

329
00:21:25.827 --> 00:21:27.620
Hopefully.
they’ll remember me and...

330
00:21:27.704 --> 00:21:30.790
Dude. you’re homeless.

331
00:21:32.709 --> 00:21:34.043
The reason why
I’m not going home

332
00:21:34.127 --> 00:21:35.962
is because
I’m recently divorced.

333
00:21:36.045 --> 00:21:39.507
Okay. then just stick around
until things cool off.

334
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:41.509
and then you can go get
your wallet.

335
00:21:41.592 --> 00:21:43.469
get yourself a house
or a new wife.

336
00:21:43.553 --> 00:21:45.096
whatever it is
that you want to do.

337
00:21:45.179 --> 00:21:46.681
I do have a television.

338
00:21:46.764 --> 00:21:48.725
You can watch the news there
on mute.

339
00:21:48.808 --> 00:21:52.145
-You have electricity?
-Yeah. and water.

340
00:21:52.228 --> 00:21:55.398
See. I’m not homeless.
just off the grid.

341
00:21:57.025 --> 00:22:00.695
I am offering you
a safe place to hide out.

342
00:22:00.778 --> 00:22:02.238
Take it or leave it.

343
00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:04.115
Okay? I’m not gonna be begging.

344
00:22:04.198 --> 00:22:08.870
It’s not like I enjoy
your company or anything.

345
00:22:29.807 --> 00:22:31.476
"No foul play"?

346
00:22:31.559 --> 00:22:33.478
Do you see what that says?

347
00:22:33.561 --> 00:22:34.562
-Yeah.
-Huh?

348
00:22:34.645 --> 00:22:36.481
You are officially free.

349
00:22:41.235 --> 00:22:42.403
Well. I...

350
00:22:42.487 --> 00:22:44.989
Thank you. Thank you. I will...

351
00:22:45.865 --> 00:22:48.326
I will get out of your hair now.

352
00:22:48.409 --> 00:22:49.619
That’s it?

353
00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.956
So eager to walk out the door.

354
00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.334
No. no. I’m not. I...

355
00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:00.213
Are you cooking something?

356
00:23:00.296 --> 00:23:02.840
Just stir-fry. Nothing.

357
00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:05.843
Well. I like...

358
00:23:06.677 --> 00:23:08.471
Do you have any extra?

359
00:23:11.641 --> 00:23:13.184
To your innocence.

360
00:23:13.267 --> 00:23:14.602
Innocence.

361
00:23:19.357 --> 00:23:21.859
I do feel bad about Bjorn.

362
00:23:22.985 --> 00:23:24.570
Of course you feel bad.

363
00:23:24.654 --> 00:23:27.949
Well. ’cause he was... you know.
he was not a horrible guy.

364
00:23:28.032 --> 00:23:31.119
He could be a... actually.
a pretty nice guy sometimes.

365
00:23:31.202 --> 00:23:34.080
He let us wear shorts
sometimes to work.

366
00:23:34.163 --> 00:23:36.207
You know. in-in the summertime.

367
00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:38.084
No. I understand. I mean...

368
00:23:38.167 --> 00:23:39.752
I understand how you must feel.

369
00:23:39.836 --> 00:23:43.923
You killed a nice guy
that let you wear the shorts.

370
00:23:44.006 --> 00:23:46.801
And you think it’s real.

371
00:23:47.885 --> 00:23:50.513
But you know what?

372
00:23:50.596 --> 00:23:56.060
You just have to observe
the feeling and then let it go.

373
00:23:56.144 --> 00:23:58.771
I want to show you something
really cool.

374
00:23:58.855 --> 00:24:00.606
Take this lighter.

375
00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:02.525
And you see those candles
over there?

376
00:24:02.608 --> 00:24:05.361
Wave it at the candles.

377
00:24:13.953 --> 00:24:16.122
Well done.

378
00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.335
Oh. it wasn’t that hard.

379
00:24:21.419 --> 00:24:24.672
Now try to do it
without the lighter.

380
00:24:30.928 --> 00:24:32.597
You like that?

381
00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.183
Are you kidding me?

382
00:24:40.104 --> 00:24:42.398
Mm.

383
00:24:42.481 --> 00:24:44.358
Beautiful.

384
00:24:44.442 --> 00:24:45.860
Well. bravo.

385
00:24:45.943 --> 00:24:49.822
Now that you’ve created
such a fantastic atmosphere.

386
00:24:49.906 --> 00:24:51.115
shall we dine?

387
00:24:51.199 --> 00:24:53.534
Do tell me about
this dream home.

388
00:24:53.618 --> 00:24:56.287
It’s just this persistent
fantasy that I can’t shake

389
00:24:56.370 --> 00:25:00.166
where I’m always drawing this...

390
00:25:00.249 --> 00:25:02.293
little abode
that’s on a peninsula.

391
00:25:02.376 --> 00:25:06.672
and I completely get lost in it.

392
00:25:06.756 --> 00:25:08.424
Show it to me.

393
00:25:08.507 --> 00:25:10.051
You have the drawings?

394
00:25:13.763 --> 00:25:15.431
Let’s see.

395
00:25:23.105 --> 00:25:24.732
I’m impressed.

396
00:25:24.815 --> 00:25:26.484
It’s very precise.

397
00:25:26.567 --> 00:25:28.236
Well. that’s the thing.

398
00:25:28.319 --> 00:25:30.947
It’s easy for me
to do the detail.

399
00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:32.823
’cause I see it
so clearly in my mind.

400
00:25:32.907 --> 00:25:34.700
Right there’s the path

401
00:25:34.784 --> 00:25:36.869
that leads out to just
sort of like a little room

402
00:25:36.953 --> 00:25:39.705
that just has a great view
of these mountains here.

403
00:25:39.789 --> 00:25:41.374
You love the pool.

404
00:25:41.457 --> 00:25:43.459
Yeah. that’s part
of an old ruin.

405
00:25:43.542 --> 00:25:46.212
And can you see
the hotel right there?

406
00:25:46.295 --> 00:25:47.964
It has an observatory.

407
00:25:48.047 --> 00:25:49.840
The Hotel Pleiades.

408
00:25:49.924 --> 00:25:51.467
Pleiades.

409
00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:53.594
Yeah. that’s a cluster of stars.

410
00:25:53.678 --> 00:25:56.013
In my mind. it feels real.

411
00:25:56.097 --> 00:25:57.473
I can see it.

412
00:25:57.556 --> 00:26:00.268
Greg. where do you think
this is?

413
00:26:00.351 --> 00:26:01.978
Where is it?

414
00:26:02.061 --> 00:26:03.938
Well. it’s right in
the brain-powered mind

415
00:26:04.021 --> 00:26:06.190
of Greg Wittle.

416
00:26:10.861 --> 00:26:12.822
- What?

417
00:26:12.905 --> 00:26:14.907
And who’s this?

418
00:26:16.659 --> 00:26:19.620
Kind of forgot
that one was in there.

419
00:26:22.957 --> 00:26:25.293
That is me.

420
00:26:25.376 --> 00:26:27.420
Look at her face.

421
00:26:27.503 --> 00:26:29.213
You drew me.

422
00:26:29.297 --> 00:26:32.758
Greg. this is not a fantasy.

423
00:26:32.842 --> 00:26:36.762
This is our real life.
outside of here.

424
00:26:36.846 --> 00:26:38.431
No. come on.

425
00:26:38.514 --> 00:26:40.224
How can that be...

426
00:26:40.308 --> 00:26:41.767
But you know that...

427
00:26:41.851 --> 00:26:43.477
-Shh.
-How... Did you...

428
00:26:43.561 --> 00:26:46.314
Let it be bigger
than your comprehension.

429
00:26:46.397 --> 00:26:49.108
You’re my guy.

430
00:26:51.235 --> 00:26:52.737
I’m your guy?

431
00:26:54.864 --> 00:26:57.033
You’re my guy.

432
00:27:02.288 --> 00:27:04.540
Kiss me.

433
00:27:30.691 --> 00:27:32.401
So. what. your phone
doesn’t work anymore?

434
00:27:32.485 --> 00:27:35.404
Well. I knew
you’d try to avoid me.

435
00:27:37.198 --> 00:27:39.950
We need to talk about Dad.

436
00:27:40.034 --> 00:27:41.786
I-I need your help.

437
00:27:41.869 --> 00:27:43.162
I-I want to find him.

438
00:27:43.245 --> 00:27:44.914
I want him to come
to my graduation.

439
00:27:47.124 --> 00:27:49.335
Just let it go. Emmy. okay?

440
00:27:49.418 --> 00:27:51.670
Follow Mom’s lead.

441
00:27:51.754 --> 00:27:53.339
No.

442
00:27:53.422 --> 00:27:56.258
I think it’d be good for him.

443
00:27:56.342 --> 00:27:58.594
Think it’d be good
for all of us.

444
00:28:04.975 --> 00:28:09.105
Did he not bring your ass to.
like. every baseball practice?

445
00:28:09.188 --> 00:28:11.023
I hated baseball.

446
00:28:12.733 --> 00:28:14.068
-

447
00:28:26.414 --> 00:28:28.541
Who taught you
how to skateboard?

448
00:28:28.624 --> 00:28:30.501
He did.

449
00:28:32.336 --> 00:28:34.422
I remember.

450
00:28:35.297 --> 00:28:36.632
I remember how many times

451
00:28:36.715 --> 00:28:38.467
he busted his ass
trying to teach me shit

452
00:28:38.551 --> 00:28:40.136
-and trying to impress me.
-

453
00:28:40.219 --> 00:28:41.720
I mean. I busted my ass. too.

454
00:28:41.804 --> 00:28:44.181
but he ate shit
way more than a few times.

455
00:28:49.937 --> 00:28:52.648
So. can you just. like...

456
00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:55.484
hold on to that?

457
00:28:55.568 --> 00:28:57.486
Help me find him.

458
00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:03.284
I can’t.

459
00:29:03.367 --> 00:29:04.493
Sorry.

460
00:29:04.577 --> 00:29:07.746
I just can’t trust him anymore.

461
00:29:16.213 --> 00:29:18.716
"Hey. Dad. how’s your back?"

462
00:29:18.799 --> 00:29:21.260
"It’s okay. It’s actually
my knee that’s bothering me."

463
00:29:21.343 --> 00:29:23.345
"Really? ’Cause I thought
you fixed that already."

464
00:29:23.429 --> 00:29:27.808
-"Oh. no. You must be thinking
about my shoulder." -Stop that.

465
00:29:27.892 --> 00:29:29.810
"Okay. your shoulder. Is it the
left one or the right one. Dad?

466
00:29:29.894 --> 00:29:32.146
-"What about next week? Is your
ankle gonna go?" -Stop it.

467
00:29:32.229 --> 00:29:34.982
-"Well. it’s always something
with you. Dad." -Stop it!

468
00:29:56.754 --> 00:29:58.172
Mm-mm.

469
00:30:15.814 --> 00:30:21.362
through these eyes

470
00:30:22.821 --> 00:30:28.744
morning light

471
00:30:28.827 --> 00:30:32.665
-

472
00:30:32.748 --> 00:30:34.458
Douchebag!

473
00:30:35.918 --> 00:30:39.421
-

474
00:30:39.505 --> 00:30:41.882
-

475
00:30:53.644 --> 00:30:56.188
-Hey! Creep.
-Nice.

476
00:30:56.272 --> 00:30:57.982
Down!

477
00:31:18.502 --> 00:31:22.006
Judgmental bitch. Take her down.

478
00:31:22.923 --> 00:31:25.050
What?

479
00:31:25.134 --> 00:31:26.552
Do it.

480
00:31:26.635 --> 00:31:29.263
-No.
-She’s not real.

481
00:31:29.346 --> 00:31:32.099
Get her.

482
00:31:32.182 --> 00:31:36.061
-

483
00:31:39.023 --> 00:31:40.232
-Go!
-

484
00:31:42.401 --> 00:31:43.527
Yeah!

485
00:31:55.998 --> 00:31:58.167
Whoa. Whoa! Whoa. whoa!

486
00:32:01.712 --> 00:32:06.717
through these eyes...

487
00:32:08.594 --> 00:32:11.096
I don’t have to feel guilty
about Bjorn!

488
00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:14.058
Cut through those illusions!

489
00:32:34.244 --> 00:32:38.499
-

490
00:32:38.582 --> 00:32:41.085
Oh. Stop!

491
00:32:48.592 --> 00:32:50.886
-

492
00:33:44.231 --> 00:33:45.899
There you go.

493
00:33:51.864 --> 00:33:53.407
Isabel. Hey.

494
00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:55.617
Ask me if I gave them my name.

495
00:33:55.701 --> 00:33:57.119
-Mm.
-Ask me.

496
00:33:57.202 --> 00:33:58.996
-Did you give them your name?
-No!

497
00:33:59.079 --> 00:34:00.789
-No way! Come on!
-No!

498
00:34:00.873 --> 00:34:02.624
I didn’t give them
your name. either.

499
00:34:02.708 --> 00:34:04.126
They can’t fuck with you

500
00:34:04.209 --> 00:34:06.712
-if you have no name. right?
-They don’t need it.

501
00:34:23.395 --> 00:34:24.521
You okay?

502
00:34:24.605 --> 00:34:26.482
I’m good.

503
00:34:26.565 --> 00:34:28.525
How do I seem?

504
00:34:30.068 --> 00:34:31.236
Good. right?

505
00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.446
Yeah.

506
00:34:32.529 --> 00:34:35.616
I’m a little disoriented.
but in a good way.

507
00:34:39.036 --> 00:34:40.829
Don’t worry about that.

508
00:34:40.913 --> 00:34:43.832
Hey. are you hungry?
Let’s go eat!

509
00:34:43.916 --> 00:34:45.584
Hi.
- Hi.

510
00:34:45.667 --> 00:34:47.169
Have you seen my dad?

511
00:34:47.252 --> 00:34:48.879
That’s what he looks like.

512
00:34:48.962 --> 00:34:50.380
Haven’t seen him.

513
00:34:50.464 --> 00:34:53.217
I think he might have been
staying here a few weeks ago.

514
00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:55.052
No. Sorry.

515
00:34:55.135 --> 00:34:56.887
It’s your turn. Come on.

516
00:34:56.970 --> 00:34:58.972
- Wait up. Yo.

517
00:34:59.056 --> 00:35:01.683
-Hey. yo. D.
-Yo.

518
00:35:01.767 --> 00:35:03.393
-Thank you.
-

519
00:35:05.354 --> 00:35:07.022
No. I don’t think so.

520
00:35:07.105 --> 00:35:11.193
Well. if you do see him.

521
00:35:11.276 --> 00:35:14.404
-will you please call me?
-Yeah.

522
00:35:14.488 --> 00:35:16.824
-Thank you so much.
-Yeah.

523
00:35:16.907 --> 00:35:18.867
We’re organizing a march.

524
00:35:18.951 --> 00:35:21.245
Situation’s gotten out of hand.
Come if you can.

525
00:35:22.412 --> 00:35:23.997
Yeah. I’ll be there.

526
00:35:31.797 --> 00:35:34.550
Get me a chicken sandwich
and some fries. okay?

527
00:35:34.633 --> 00:35:36.176
I’ll see you in there.
You go ahead.

528
00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:38.720
-And a soda?
-Yeah. and a soda.

529
00:35:38.804 --> 00:35:40.556
You got it.

530
00:35:49.648 --> 00:35:51.441
Yo. what can I get for you?

531
00:35:51.525 --> 00:35:52.901
Can I get two

532
00:35:52.985 --> 00:35:54.611
artisanal chicken sandwiches.

533
00:35:54.695 --> 00:35:57.531
two large fries
and two sodas. please?

534
00:35:57.614 --> 00:35:59.700
That’ll be 12.76.

535
00:36:02.911 --> 00:36:05.497
Uh. okay.
my friend’s got my money.

536
00:36:05.581 --> 00:36:07.749
Let me just...

537
00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:17.426
I think I’m just gonna
go ahead and order later.

538
00:36:17.509 --> 00:36:19.678
Uh. all right.

539
00:36:19.761 --> 00:36:21.054
’Cause I want to get
everything together.

540
00:36:21.138 --> 00:36:22.639
Yeah. no problem.

541
00:36:24.725 --> 00:36:26.268
-It’s just easier.
-Yeah. No problem.

542
00:36:26.351 --> 00:36:27.978
I’ll just get it later.

543
00:36:42.284 --> 00:36:44.620
You want to go out. honey?

544
00:36:44.703 --> 00:36:45.996
I need money.

545
00:36:46.079 --> 00:36:48.498
-Come here. cutie.
-Hey. come here.

546
00:36:49.833 --> 00:36:52.169
-Did you hear what I said?
-

547
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:56.423
It’s expired.
but that don’t mean much.

548
00:36:56.506 --> 00:36:59.384
We have to toss food after
two hours on the shelf. so...

549
00:36:59.468 --> 00:37:01.970
-Okay. thanks.
-Yeah.

550
00:37:22.824 --> 00:37:26.078
It’s a little cold.
but it’s good.

551
00:37:26.161 --> 00:37:28.372
I don’t mind cold food.

552
00:37:51.603 --> 00:37:55.399
Let’s go find Kendo
and get the amulet refilled.

553
00:37:58.068 --> 00:38:00.904
Well. that’s
the funny thing about accents is

554
00:38:00.988 --> 00:38:02.656
sometimes they can sound strong.

555
00:38:02.739 --> 00:38:04.533
depending on the region
that you’re in.

556
00:38:04.616 --> 00:38:06.910
But if you’re not from
that region. then it just...

557
00:38:06.994 --> 00:38:08.870
This is where you wait.

558
00:38:08.954 --> 00:38:10.706
I’ll be back.

559
00:38:10.789 --> 00:38:12.165
-Here?
-Yeah.

560
00:38:12.249 --> 00:38:14.001
Don’t move.

561
00:38:27.472 --> 00:38:28.598
Hi. honey.

562
00:38:30.017 --> 00:38:31.685
Who’s the new guy?

563
00:38:31.768 --> 00:38:33.729
Don’t want to talk about it.

564
00:38:33.812 --> 00:38:35.188
He’s cute.

565
00:38:35.272 --> 00:38:37.190
I’m here for some yellows.

566
00:38:37.274 --> 00:38:39.151
Fill it up.

567
00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:43.155
You really broke my heart.
You know that.

568
00:38:43.238 --> 00:38:45.115
Get to work.

569
00:38:45.198 --> 00:38:46.658
I have real feelings.

570
00:38:50.078 --> 00:38:52.414
Hey. you want some mud? Junk?

571
00:38:52.497 --> 00:38:54.249
Skag?

572
00:38:54.332 --> 00:38:56.251
-Oh. no. No. no. I’m good.
-Black pearl?

573
00:38:56.334 --> 00:38:58.253
-Gato? Caballo?
-I’m all right.

574
00:38:58.336 --> 00:39:00.422
Hey. man. whatever. Your loss.

575
00:39:03.842 --> 00:39:06.470
-

576
00:39:09.931 --> 00:39:11.266
...instead of waiting around

577
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:12.893
to collect
government handouts...

578
00:39:12.976 --> 00:39:14.770
You sure he went
west on San Fernando?

579
00:39:14.853 --> 00:39:17.314
I-I-- No. I’m not sure.
I never said I was sure.

580
00:39:17.397 --> 00:39:19.775
I see him. Sir. can you just
pull over right here?

581
00:39:22.444 --> 00:39:24.321
And can you just wait
for one minute?

582
00:39:25.489 --> 00:39:27.032
-Dad?
-

583
00:39:27.115 --> 00:39:28.492
Dad.

584
00:39:29.868 --> 00:39:30.911
Emily?

585
00:39:30.994 --> 00:39:33.121
Hi.
- Oh. my gosh.

586
00:39:33.205 --> 00:39:34.831
How are you?
What are you doing here?

587
00:39:34.915 --> 00:39:36.666
-I. um...
-Is everything okay?

588
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:38.126
Um...

589
00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:41.546
I’m sorry. it has been...
it’s been a crazy few days.

590
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:44.591
I need you to come
with me right now.

591
00:39:44.674 --> 00:39:46.301
-Okay?
-Yes. of course.

592
00:39:46.384 --> 00:39:47.594
-Okay.
-Gosh. yes. Yeah. sure.

593
00:39:47.677 --> 00:39:49.012
-Okay. come on.
-No. but...

594
00:39:49.096 --> 00:39:50.722
Can we wait just a moment?

595
00:39:50.806 --> 00:39:52.933
I just...
I’m just waiting for...

596
00:39:53.016 --> 00:39:55.977
I’m waiting for someone.
for a friend.

597
00:39:56.061 --> 00:39:57.437
And then we’re gonna go.

598
00:39:57.521 --> 00:39:59.397
Dad.

599
00:39:59.481 --> 00:40:01.066
Please.

600
00:40:01.149 --> 00:40:02.526
Hurry the fuck up. Kendo.

601
00:40:02.609 --> 00:40:04.820
I have to do this correctly.

602
00:40:04.903 --> 00:40:06.571
And I have places to be.

603
00:40:06.655 --> 00:40:08.156
Graduation.

604
00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:09.324
Oh. my God.

605
00:40:09.407 --> 00:40:10.826
I did not forget.

606
00:40:10.909 --> 00:40:12.410
and I’m definitely
gonna be there.

607
00:40:12.494 --> 00:40:16.998
And I want to take you
and Arthur to Cliff’s Edge

608
00:40:17.082 --> 00:40:19.417
with your mother.
if she’ll allow it.

609
00:40:19.501 --> 00:40:21.169
I already graduated. Dad.

610
00:40:23.171 --> 00:40:24.422
What?

611
00:40:24.506 --> 00:40:26.174
Like two weeks ago.

612
00:40:31.263 --> 00:40:32.764
It’s okay.

613
00:40:34.599 --> 00:40:36.059
It’s okay.

614
00:40:36.143 --> 00:40:37.686
Here. I-I’m gonna...

615
00:40:41.565 --> 00:40:43.275
I have so many...

616
00:40:43.358 --> 00:40:44.818
...thoughts
I wish you could see.

617
00:40:44.901 --> 00:40:47.320
I’m gonna leave you with...

618
00:40:51.283 --> 00:40:53.577
Um. I’m gonna leave you
with this.

619
00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:55.203
It’s my phone number. okay?

620
00:40:55.287 --> 00:40:57.664
-Okay.
-Just call me when you’re ready.

621
00:41:05.213 --> 00:41:06.756
Is he real?

622
00:41:08.258 --> 00:41:10.051
Wouldn’t you like to know.

623
00:41:17.017 --> 00:41:19.227
Who was that?

624
00:41:19.311 --> 00:41:21.521
Hey. Who was that?

625
00:41:25.692 --> 00:41:26.902
That’s my daughter.

626
00:41:26.985 --> 00:41:28.987
Ignore her. She’s not real.

627
00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:31.198
-Why would you say that?
-Because it’s the truth.

628
00:41:31.281 --> 00:41:34.034
What do you want me to say?
I’m not making this shit up.

629
00:41:34.117 --> 00:41:38.121
Let’s just get off the street
and have some of this.

630
00:41:40.373 --> 00:41:42.292
Actually.
I don’t think I want any.

631
00:41:42.375 --> 00:41:45.295
I don’t think I want to have
any special powers right now.

632
00:41:45.378 --> 00:41:46.838
Fine. don’t.

633
00:41:46.922 --> 00:41:48.882
It’s not like anybody’s
twisting your arm or anything.

634
00:41:48.965 --> 00:41:50.675
No. I’m not saying
that you are...

635
00:41:50.759 --> 00:41:52.177
You think you can just walk

636
00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:54.179
through my neighborhood
tax-free?

637
00:41:58.683 --> 00:42:00.518
Oh.

638
00:42:00.602 --> 00:42:02.812
Don’t worry about me. huh?

639
00:42:02.896 --> 00:42:04.439
I’m fine.

640
00:42:04.522 --> 00:42:06.066
I don’t know about you. though.

641
00:42:06.149 --> 00:42:07.651
Don’t walk away from me.

642
00:42:09.069 --> 00:42:10.612
Isabel. come on.

643
00:42:10.695 --> 00:42:12.989
-Here. give me one of those.
-I thought you didn’t want any.

644
00:42:13.073 --> 00:42:15.367
Yeah. people make mistakes.
I made a mistake.

645
00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:16.910
Don’t make me beg.

646
00:42:16.993 --> 00:42:19.788
Isabel. please. come on.

647
00:42:22.165 --> 00:42:24.334
Hey. hey. that’s...

648
00:42:24.417 --> 00:42:25.961
That’s all we have.

649
00:42:26.044 --> 00:42:27.837
Give me that.

650
00:42:41.393 --> 00:42:43.520
Oh. dude!

651
00:42:43.603 --> 00:42:44.771
Look at you.

652
00:42:44.854 --> 00:42:48.275
You’re like
the telekinetic warrior!

653
00:42:54.114 --> 00:42:56.866
Okay. Greg.
Okay. it’s okay. it’s okay.

654
00:43:16.803 --> 00:43:18.680
Isabel!

655
00:43:21.975 --> 00:43:23.935
Isabel.

656
00:43:27.272 --> 00:43:28.606
Isabel!

657
00:44:15.362 --> 00:44:17.155
Think fast. Greggo.

658
00:44:17.238 --> 00:44:18.531
Oh. yeah.

659
00:44:18.615 --> 00:44:20.241
Good on you. bud.

660
00:44:29.125 --> 00:44:31.169
Hello. You’ve reached Emily.

661
00:44:31.252 --> 00:44:32.379
Leave me a message.

662
00:44:32.462 --> 00:44:35.465
Hey. it’s Dad. and. um.

663
00:44:35.548 --> 00:44:38.802
I am. um. just trying
to reach you.

664
00:44:38.885 --> 00:44:40.804
Um. you might not
recognize this number.

665
00:44:40.887 --> 00:44:42.514
I’m calling from a pay phone.

666
00:44:42.597 --> 00:44:44.808
But I will try you back.

667
00:44:44.891 --> 00:44:47.435
I don’t have my cell phone.
so I’ll try you back.

668
00:44:47.519 --> 00:44:49.437
All right. thank you.

669
00:45:07.914 --> 00:45:10.583
-Where the fuck were you?
-Hey!

670
00:45:10.667 --> 00:45:12.377
I thought you left me! I...

671
00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:14.129
No. you weren’t here
when I woke up!

672
00:45:14.212 --> 00:45:16.756
I didn’t know where you were!
I-I left you a note!

673
00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:19.676
No. I didn’t see any note.

674
00:45:19.759 --> 00:45:21.386
-What is this?
-No. I didn’t...

675
00:45:21.469 --> 00:45:22.929
-I didn’t see that.
-What is this?

676
00:45:23.012 --> 00:45:24.556
I-I did not see it.

677
00:45:24.639 --> 00:45:27.267
-"Be right back."
-Yes. I didn’t see it.

678
00:45:27.350 --> 00:45:30.311
"Kisses. hug. kisses. hug.
Isabel. Love."

679
00:45:30.395 --> 00:45:32.897
I’m sorry.
-

680
00:45:32.981 --> 00:45:35.400
I went to...

681
00:45:35.483 --> 00:45:38.111
I went to get fertilizer
for Ophelia.

682
00:45:38.194 --> 00:45:39.654
Okay. I...

683
00:45:39.737 --> 00:45:41.614
Yeah. when I woke up.
I was yelling. "Isabel..."

684
00:45:41.698 --> 00:45:43.074
Where are the yellows?

685
00:45:43.158 --> 00:45:45.243
-Uh. they...
-

686
00:45:45.326 --> 00:45:48.455
Somebody’s been
in our place. Greg.

687
00:45:48.538 --> 00:45:52.167
The-the-the yellows are missing.

688
00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:55.170
And-and they... they took
the-the drawings of our house.

689
00:45:55.253 --> 00:45:56.880
No. no. I took those.

690
00:45:56.963 --> 00:45:58.381
I got ’em. They’re right here.

691
00:45:58.465 --> 00:46:01.259
Look. I got ’em.
They’re right here.

692
00:46:01.342 --> 00:46:02.719
Why?

693
00:46:02.802 --> 00:46:04.220
Why did you...

694
00:46:04.304 --> 00:46:06.139
Why did you take them away?

695
00:46:06.222 --> 00:46:07.432
No. I...

696
00:46:07.515 --> 00:46:09.142
It’s our memory of our house.

697
00:46:09.225 --> 00:46:10.977
-I just wanted to look at them.
-Are you trying to forget?

698
00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:13.438
No. I’m not trying to forget.
I just wanted to look at them.

699
00:46:13.521 --> 00:46:15.440
Did you take them
because you’re leaving?

700
00:46:15.523 --> 00:46:16.357
No!

701
00:46:16.441 --> 00:46:18.026
I didn’t. I-I felt...

702
00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:20.278
I felt self-conscious
having them there.

703
00:46:20.361 --> 00:46:22.572
’cause it’s like a...

704
00:46:32.916 --> 00:46:34.709
Did you see her?

705
00:46:34.792 --> 00:46:36.127
No.

706
00:46:37.921 --> 00:46:40.381
Tell me the truth.

707
00:46:40.465 --> 00:46:42.383
-I didn’t see her.
-Why you have that in there?

708
00:46:42.467 --> 00:46:44.302
-I-I did not...
-Did you call her?

709
00:46:44.385 --> 00:46:46.804
No. I-I thought about it.
but I didn’t.

710
00:46:46.888 --> 00:46:49.807
I didn’t... I...
I didn’t see her.

711
00:46:49.891 --> 00:46:51.893
I tried. but-but I-I...

712
00:46:51.976 --> 00:46:53.853
Why is it such a terrible thing?

713
00:46:53.937 --> 00:46:56.147
It’s not supposed
to be happening.

714
00:46:56.231 --> 00:46:59.067
-Isabel...

715
00:46:59.150 --> 00:47:00.985
-I didn’t see her.
-I don’t understand.

716
00:47:01.069 --> 00:47:02.403
I didn’t see her.

717
00:47:02.487 --> 00:47:05.240
I’m really worried
about you. Greg.

718
00:47:05.323 --> 00:47:08.243
-I’m really worried about you.
-Okay.

719
00:47:08.326 --> 00:47:09.911
-You’re...
-I’m okay.

720
00:47:09.994 --> 00:47:12.372
You’re getting sucked
into the illusion.

721
00:47:12.455 --> 00:47:14.916
and you’re dragging me
in with you.

722
00:47:14.999 --> 00:47:20.505
I know this is not real.
and I can barely breathe.

723
00:47:22.215 --> 00:47:26.928
and-and my stomach is turning.
and my skin hurts.

724
00:47:27.011 --> 00:47:29.180
-and I feel like I’m drowning.
-Isabel. it’s okay. just...

725
00:47:29.264 --> 00:47:32.308
And I know this is not real.

726
00:47:33.685 --> 00:47:38.648
You are getting seduced
by the simulation.

727
00:47:38.731 --> 00:47:41.693
and I’m losing you.

728
00:47:41.776 --> 00:47:44.988
I-I think maybe we should
just stop hanging out.

729
00:47:50.368 --> 00:47:52.537
You’re my soul mate.

730
00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:54.664
You can’t just walk away

731
00:47:54.747 --> 00:47:57.458
and think that
you can disconnect from me.

732
00:47:57.542 --> 00:47:59.627
If you could see the difference
between what’s real

733
00:47:59.711 --> 00:48:01.588
and what’s illusion.
you’d know that.

734
00:48:01.671 --> 00:48:04.090
And you’re supposed
to know that by now.

735
00:48:04.173 --> 00:48:05.883
How am I supposed to know?

736
00:48:05.967 --> 00:48:09.095
Y-You’re the one telling me
he’s real and she’s not real.

737
00:48:09.178 --> 00:48:11.681
and then I have to take
your word for it. right?

738
00:48:11.764 --> 00:48:14.559
That’s really your trick.
is it forces me

739
00:48:14.642 --> 00:48:15.852
-to depend on you.
-No.

740
00:48:15.935 --> 00:48:17.312
No. no. no. It makes me...

741
00:48:17.395 --> 00:48:19.856
It’s very clever.
It makes me believe in you.

742
00:48:19.939 --> 00:48:21.858
But guess what.
I don’t believe in you.

743
00:48:21.941 --> 00:48:23.276
I’ve never believed in you.

744
00:48:23.359 --> 00:48:25.862
How could someone believe you?

745
00:48:25.945 --> 00:48:28.489
Tell me something
that makes me believe in you.

746
00:48:28.573 --> 00:48:31.159
-Show me something.
-Okay.

747
00:48:32.785 --> 00:48:34.704
Okay. I get it.

748
00:48:36.998 --> 00:48:39.626
You... you have to see it
for yourself.

749
00:48:39.709 --> 00:48:41.169
See what?

750
00:48:41.252 --> 00:48:44.005
We have to take
a special kind of crystal.

751
00:48:44.088 --> 00:48:45.465
different from the yellows.

752
00:48:47.675 --> 00:48:51.429
They are very rare.
I got them from Kendo.

753
00:48:51.512 --> 00:48:53.014
They’re blue crystals.

754
00:48:53.097 --> 00:48:55.516
It’s an exit mechanism.

755
00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:58.061
They will eject us
from this simulation.

756
00:48:58.144 --> 00:49:00.980
We have to take ten each.

757
00:49:01.064 --> 00:49:03.983
Two. three. four. five.

758
00:49:04.067 --> 00:49:07.779
six. seven. eight. nine. ten.

759
00:49:07.862 --> 00:49:10.907
One. two. three.
four. five. six.

760
00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:12.575
Shit.

761
00:49:12.659 --> 00:49:14.994
Is-is that enough?

762
00:49:15.078 --> 00:49:17.163
Fuck it. We’ll take the chance.

763
00:49:17.246 --> 00:49:19.207
Where-where did you get
the measurement from?

764
00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:21.250
It’s theoretical.

765
00:49:21.334 --> 00:49:23.294
I think we’ll be fine.

766
00:49:25.505 --> 00:49:28.591
It has to be taken
through the nose.

767
00:49:30.093 --> 00:49:31.386
Come.

768
00:49:38.935 --> 00:49:40.061
Come on. baby.

769
00:49:40.144 --> 00:49:43.773
We have to exit
this stupid simulation.

770
00:49:45.274 --> 00:49:47.443
Is it safe?

771
00:49:48.653 --> 00:49:50.738
Kind of.

772
00:50:49.297 --> 00:50:52.592
Dr. Clemens. you okay?

773
00:50:52.675 --> 00:50:54.802
Yes. we’re okay. Liang.

774
00:50:54.886 --> 00:50:56.053
Don’t panic.

775
00:50:56.137 --> 00:50:58.306
We ejected the brainbox
on purpose.

776
00:50:58.389 --> 00:51:02.059
Dr. Wittle formed an unhealthy
attachment to an FGP again.

777
00:51:02.143 --> 00:51:03.561
and he was dragging me with him.

778
00:51:03.644 --> 00:51:06.105
Oh. And your exit mechanism?

779
00:51:06.189 --> 00:51:08.107
Blue algorithm. as expected.

780
00:51:08.191 --> 00:51:11.778
But this time. it was
no easy task to get crystals.

781
00:51:11.861 --> 00:51:13.404
Thank God that Kendo
has developed

782
00:51:13.488 --> 00:51:15.031
such a talent for finding them.

783
00:51:15.114 --> 00:51:18.201
Well. if you don’t
mind me asking.

784
00:51:18.284 --> 00:51:20.745
what did this one feel like?

785
00:51:20.828 --> 00:51:25.625
It wasn’t war
or extreme poverty.

786
00:51:25.708 --> 00:51:27.376
but. hell. it was icky.

787
00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:29.796
I’m so glad to...

788
00:51:29.879 --> 00:51:31.923
be able to breathe
this fresh air.

789
00:51:32.006 --> 00:51:35.259
-Please disconnect Dr. Wittle.
-Okay.

790
00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:41.808
Hello. Dr. Wittle.

791
00:51:41.891 --> 00:51:44.185
You feeling okay?

792
00:51:44.268 --> 00:51:46.479
I feel okay.

793
00:51:52.485 --> 00:51:56.113
Well... this...

794
00:51:56.197 --> 00:51:58.574
should get your electrolytes up.

795
00:51:58.658 --> 00:51:59.951
Thank you.

796
00:52:00.034 --> 00:52:01.369
What is it?

797
00:52:01.452 --> 00:52:03.538
Lime Gatorade.

798
00:52:04.413 --> 00:52:05.873
Yeah.

799
00:52:05.957 --> 00:52:08.251
Easy does it. There we go.

800
00:52:15.383 --> 00:52:17.134
There’s my guy.

801
00:52:17.218 --> 00:52:19.929
Welcome home.

802
00:52:20.012 --> 00:52:21.973
What’s a FGP?

803
00:52:23.474 --> 00:52:24.934
Note the memory gap.

804
00:52:25.017 --> 00:52:26.978
You said "FGP." You were...

805
00:52:27.061 --> 00:52:31.190
Yes. it’s short for
"fake generated person."

806
00:52:31.274 --> 00:52:33.359
Only these volunteers are real.

807
00:52:35.319 --> 00:52:37.029
Did you save our incarnations?

808
00:52:37.113 --> 00:52:39.156
Mm. they’re automatically
in the cloud.

809
00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:40.992
Uh. shall I get it going now?

810
00:52:41.075 --> 00:52:42.410
Give us a couple of hours.

811
00:52:42.493 --> 00:52:45.329
I’m taking Dr. Wittle to lunch.

812
00:52:45.413 --> 00:52:47.790
Sounds good. I’ll be here.

813
00:52:55.673 --> 00:53:00.136
Some FGPs are
more convincing than others.

814
00:53:50.478 --> 00:53:52.688
What do you think?

815
00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:59.946
I think this place
is overwhelming.

816
00:54:00.029 --> 00:54:03.658
Good overwhelming
or bad overwhelming?

817
00:54:03.741 --> 00:54:05.660
Great overwhelming.

818
00:54:05.743 --> 00:54:08.245
-What’s with all the...

819
00:54:09.997 --> 00:54:13.918
What is with the-the hologram
or the-the ghost people?

820
00:54:14.001 --> 00:54:17.129
Oh. Telepresence.
It’s all the rage these days.

821
00:54:18.047 --> 00:54:19.632
Hello. Dr. Clemens.

822
00:54:19.715 --> 00:54:21.092
Dr. Wittle.

823
00:54:21.175 --> 00:54:22.760
How’s the research coming?

824
00:54:22.843 --> 00:54:24.679
It’s getting there.

825
00:54:26.013 --> 00:54:28.391
Any problems
we should be aware of?

826
00:54:29.558 --> 00:54:30.726
No.

827
00:54:30.810 --> 00:54:33.020
-Mm. Mm.
-Lovely to see you.

828
00:54:37.525 --> 00:54:39.902
-That was quite a look
she was giving you. -

829
00:54:39.986 --> 00:54:43.197
-Any problems I should
be aware of? -

830
00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:44.532
Are you okay?

831
00:54:44.615 --> 00:54:47.201
Yeah. yeah. I’m good. I’m good.

832
00:54:47.284 --> 00:54:49.537
Would you like to take
the scenic route?

833
00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:50.955
Yes.

834
00:55:01.048 --> 00:55:03.759
Now. why am I not
remembering any of this?

835
00:55:03.843 --> 00:55:05.594
Don’t worry about it.

836
00:55:05.678 --> 00:55:08.014
Sometimes it happens
to the volunteers.

837
00:55:08.097 --> 00:55:10.057
To some of them. anyway.

838
00:55:10.141 --> 00:55:11.559
It’ll wear off.

839
00:55:16.605 --> 00:55:19.525
Think fast. Greggo.
-Hi. Oh.

840
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:24.447
Good on you. bud. Mm!

841
00:55:25.322 --> 00:55:28.701
Oh. put that brain boner away.

842
00:55:28.784 --> 00:55:30.369
We got to get some olive oil.

843
00:55:30.453 --> 00:55:32.079
-Oh. no. Greg.
-Yes.

844
00:55:32.163 --> 00:55:34.874
-No. we have gallons
of it at home. -Yes.

845
00:55:34.957 --> 00:55:37.251
Home?

846
00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:09.992
I can’t believe it.

847
00:56:10.076 --> 00:56:12.787
I told you.

848
00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:19.752
Hotel Pleiades.

849
00:56:19.835 --> 00:56:21.170
Yeah.

850
00:56:21.253 --> 00:56:24.090
What a fantastic name
for a hotel

851
00:56:24.173 --> 00:56:26.842
that has its own observatory.

852
00:56:26.926 --> 00:56:29.303
"Play at ease."

853
00:57:51.302 --> 00:57:54.638
How did this whole world
come to be?

854
00:57:59.435 --> 00:58:01.187
Your memory’s not back.

855
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:02.980
No.

856
00:58:03.063 --> 00:58:04.607
Is that bad?

857
00:58:07.026 --> 00:58:10.404
I was so scared to lose you.

858
00:58:10.487 --> 00:58:15.409
I made an irresponsible
and stupid decision.

859
00:58:15.492 --> 00:58:17.953
We shouldn’t have exited
like that.

860
00:58:18.037 --> 00:58:21.290
without the appropriate
dosage and...

861
00:58:21.373 --> 00:58:23.876
Maybe it might...
it might not come back.

862
00:58:23.959 --> 00:58:25.169
Who cares?

863
00:58:25.252 --> 00:58:27.129
I love not remembering
this place.

864
00:58:27.213 --> 00:58:30.799
because I get to
discover it all again.

865
00:58:30.883 --> 00:58:33.469
I’m walking around
just like a newborn.

866
00:58:33.552 --> 00:58:38.766
experiencing all of this beauty
for the first time.

867
00:58:38.849 --> 00:58:41.352
I just want to know. is it...
where did it come from?

868
00:58:41.435 --> 00:58:43.270
Has it always been like this?

869
00:58:48.859 --> 00:58:51.528
This place was actually
much worse

870
00:58:51.612 --> 00:58:53.656
than the one we just exited.

871
00:58:55.449 --> 00:58:58.160
It got so bad.

872
00:58:58.244 --> 00:59:01.080
I mean.
pollution was to a degree

873
00:59:01.163 --> 00:59:03.916
that people would just
drop dead on the street.

874
00:59:03.999 --> 00:59:08.420
and the level of poverty
was insufferable. It...

875
00:59:08.504 --> 00:59:09.797
I can’t...

876
00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:12.091
Looking at this.
I can’t picture that.

877
00:59:12.174 --> 00:59:13.592
I mean. what happened?

878
00:59:13.676 --> 00:59:15.177
Three things.

879
00:59:15.261 --> 00:59:16.553
Just three things?

880
00:59:16.637 --> 00:59:17.846
-Mm. Yeah.
-Okay.

881
00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:19.139
-Can you guess?
-No.

882
00:59:19.223 --> 00:59:21.100
-Oh. come on.
-I don’t know.

883
00:59:21.183 --> 00:59:23.143
Automation.

884
00:59:23.227 --> 00:59:25.396
synthetic biology

885
00:59:25.479 --> 00:59:28.440
and asteroid mining.

886
00:59:28.524 --> 00:59:31.402
I wasn’t gonna guess that.

887
00:59:32.945 --> 00:59:34.905
Oh. I have... Oh. wait.

888
00:59:34.989 --> 00:59:36.782
I’m gonna get your memory back.

889
00:59:36.865 --> 00:59:38.409
I’m gonna get your mem...

890
00:59:38.492 --> 00:59:40.661
I’m gonna trigger that memory.

891
00:59:40.744 --> 00:59:43.747
-You’re coming back. Watch this.
-

892
00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:46.333
I’m scared.

893
00:59:46.417 --> 00:59:48.627
Yes!

894
00:59:50.421 --> 00:59:51.672
Ta-da!

895
00:59:51.755 --> 00:59:54.216
The Thought Visualizer.

896
00:59:59.555 --> 01:00:02.057
You don’t remember your baby?

897
01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:05.686
This is your invention.

898
01:00:05.769 --> 01:00:07.229
I invented that?

899
01:00:07.313 --> 01:00:10.149
Oh. it’s. like. super popular

900
01:00:10.232 --> 01:00:13.027
in very small circles.

901
01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:14.903
Give it a try.

902
01:00:14.987 --> 01:00:16.822
What is it?

903
01:00:16.905 --> 01:00:20.242
A Thought... Visualizer.

904
01:00:20.326 --> 01:00:22.328
Okay. but I don’t know
what that is.

905
01:00:22.411 --> 01:00:24.204
Okay. introduce yourself.

906
01:00:24.288 --> 01:00:25.456
Hello.

907
01:00:25.539 --> 01:00:29.126
I’m Greg Wittle.

908
01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:36.050
Strawberries.

909
01:00:36.133 --> 01:00:38.635
A dinosaur...

910
01:00:38.719 --> 01:00:40.471
swimming in the ocean.

911
01:00:40.554 --> 01:00:43.932
A cheetah chasing a gazelle.

912
01:00:44.016 --> 01:00:45.893
-A volcano.
-

913
01:00:45.976 --> 01:00:47.394
Oh. my favorite one.

914
01:00:47.478 --> 01:00:49.521
Do my favorite one. Say...

915
01:00:49.605 --> 01:00:51.857
"We’re in a pickle."

916
01:00:55.527 --> 01:00:57.321
We’re in a pickle.

917
01:00:57.404 --> 01:00:59.448
-

918
01:00:59.531 --> 01:01:01.241
I love it.

919
01:01:01.325 --> 01:01:03.702
But you know what?
This is not just a toy.

920
01:01:03.786 --> 01:01:06.997
It’s amazing
for illustrating things.

921
01:01:07.081 --> 01:01:10.876
Sit up straight
and pay attention. Dr. Wittle.

922
01:01:10.959 --> 01:01:13.921
Science saved the world.

923
01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:18.884
Synthetic biology fixed
all the environmental problems.

924
01:01:18.967 --> 01:01:21.970
And asteroid mining

925
01:01:22.054 --> 01:01:25.641
brought mountains of new money.

926
01:01:25.724 --> 01:01:29.853
And the guy that had the company
for the asteroid mining...

927
01:01:29.937 --> 01:01:31.814
-That guy.
-Yeah.

928
01:01:31.897 --> 01:01:35.567
He just started giving
all this free money away.

929
01:01:35.651 --> 01:01:38.320
I mean. every single person here

930
01:01:38.404 --> 01:01:41.698
gets a base of 500.000K a year.

931
01:01:41.782 --> 01:01:45.035
And. of course. then the robots.
they started doing

932
01:01:45.119 --> 01:01:48.038
all the boring
and tedious tasks.

933
01:01:48.122 --> 01:01:52.751
We had the freedom and the time
to explore our passions:

934
01:01:52.835 --> 01:01:57.256
science. art. whatever.
whatever you wanted.

935
01:01:57.339 --> 01:01:59.800
We went from a broken world

936
01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:03.011
to a beautiful. sustainable.

937
01:02:03.095 --> 01:02:05.139
safe. peaceful Earth.

938
01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:08.100
You have to admit.

939
01:02:08.183 --> 01:02:09.726
this is spectacular.

940
01:02:11.395 --> 01:02:12.813
Yes.

941
01:02:14.022 --> 01:02:16.650
-But you know what?
-What?

942
01:02:19.111 --> 01:02:21.280
The thing is that...

943
01:02:21.363 --> 01:02:24.241
it’s amazing how easy

944
01:02:24.324 --> 01:02:28.036
humans can get used to
even something spectacular.

945
01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:31.874
Most people say.
"Ignorance is bliss."

946
01:02:31.957 --> 01:02:34.376
but I say...

947
01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:39.047
you have to experience the good
to appreciate the bad.

948
01:02:39.131 --> 01:02:41.425
No. the other way around.

949
01:02:42.885 --> 01:02:44.720
Exactly.

950
01:02:44.803 --> 01:02:48.432
So that’s where
the brainbox comes from.

951
01:02:53.228 --> 01:02:54.521
It works.

952
01:02:54.605 --> 01:02:55.939
You really mean that?

953
01:02:56.023 --> 01:02:58.108
-Yes.
-You really think it works?

954
01:03:01.153 --> 01:03:04.573
I’m sitting here.
I couldn’t be more...

955
01:03:10.746 --> 01:03:13.123
I couldn’t be more grateful.

956
01:03:13.207 --> 01:03:15.083
Greg.

957
01:03:15.167 --> 01:03:17.169
Let’s go for a swim.

958
01:03:17.252 --> 01:03:19.755
-Oh. we can’t.
-Yes. we can.

959
01:03:19.838 --> 01:03:22.299
-No. we have to go back.
-No.

960
01:03:22.382 --> 01:03:24.384
No. we have to go
back to the lab.

961
01:03:24.468 --> 01:03:27.012
We will. in a little bit.

962
01:03:27.095 --> 01:03:28.931
Come on.

963
01:03:29.014 --> 01:03:31.225
No. I have to take this
very seriously.

964
01:03:31.308 --> 01:03:32.935
I know.
I’m taking it seriously. too.

965
01:03:33.018 --> 01:03:35.103
But you can’t just give me
a bite of an apple

966
01:03:35.187 --> 01:03:37.856
-and then show it and then take
it away. -I already messed up.

967
01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:39.691
Give me another...
give me another couple bites.

968
01:03:39.775 --> 01:03:41.777
-I already exited before it was
over because of you. -I know.

969
01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:44.071
Listen. listen. listen.
listen. listen. listen. listen.

970
01:03:44.154 --> 01:03:45.739
We are gonna go back.

971
01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:48.408
We’re just gonna
just crunch into this apple

972
01:03:48.492 --> 01:03:51.537
-for a few more days. and then
we’re going back. -

973
01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:54.748
But first. we’re gonna swim.
Come on.

974
01:03:55.958 --> 01:03:57.918
I’m scared.

975
01:03:59.419 --> 01:04:00.712
-Shut up.
-

976
01:04:00.796 --> 01:04:02.881
Just shut the fuck up.

977
01:04:05.717 --> 01:04:07.594
Just one day.

978
01:04:07.678 --> 01:04:09.513
One more day.

979
01:04:09.596 --> 01:04:11.473
That’s it.

980
01:04:39.418 --> 01:04:42.087
Whoo!

981
01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:43.797
Careful.
-

982
01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:46.466
Is there a little bit
of a shindig going on?

983
01:04:46.550 --> 01:04:49.052
-A what?
-Soiree.

984
01:04:49.136 --> 01:04:50.429
A fiesta.

985
01:04:50.512 --> 01:04:52.431
Oh. yes!

986
01:04:52.514 --> 01:04:53.974
The mixer!

987
01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:56.143
Artists and scientists
get together twice a month.

988
01:04:56.226 --> 01:04:57.686
and I forgot it was today.

989
01:04:57.769 --> 01:05:00.939
Oh. who’s having
the memory problem now. honey?

990
01:05:01.023 --> 01:05:03.525
Now. don’t worry. it happens
to some of the volunteers.

991
01:05:03.609 --> 01:05:06.236
-It should come back. hopefully.
-Cállate.

992
01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:11.867
So. is this how you imagined it?

993
01:05:12.868 --> 01:05:15.245
Hmm? The Hotel Pleiades?

994
01:05:17.205 --> 01:05:18.582
Mm!

995
01:05:20.626 --> 01:05:22.711
Thanks.

996
01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:28.091
It’s so nice. huh?

997
01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:30.510
Hi.

998
01:05:30.594 --> 01:05:32.304
-Dr. Clemens.
-

999
01:05:32.387 --> 01:05:34.556
-Oh. Dr. Nye.
-It’s so good to see you.

1000
01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:36.391
-Thanks for taking the time.
-Yes.

1001
01:05:36.475 --> 01:05:37.643
Hope you’re having a good time.

1002
01:05:37.726 --> 01:05:38.852
We’re having a great time.
You remember Greg?

1003
01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:39.978
Dr. Wittle?

1004
01:05:40.062 --> 01:05:41.855
-Yes. Greg.
-Yes. we ordered one of

1005
01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:43.774
your Thought Visualizers.

1006
01:05:43.857 --> 01:05:45.859
It’s a lot of fun.

1007
01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:48.945
-Have you ever said to it.
"I’m in a pickle"? -Yeah.

1008
01:05:49.029 --> 01:05:50.238
-Have you ever done that?
-We...

1009
01:05:50.322 --> 01:05:51.365
It’s so good.

1010
01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:52.866
No. listen. "I’m in a pickle."

1011
01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:54.284
-Next time. you try it.
-Okay.

1012
01:05:54.368 --> 01:05:55.744
It’s amazing.

1013
01:05:55.827 --> 01:05:57.329
-Well. you two look so good.
- Thank you.

1014
01:05:57.412 --> 01:05:58.914
-So do you. -Uh. thank you
for taking the time.

1015
01:05:58.997 --> 01:06:00.874
Oh. this?
- Yes.

1016
01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:03.001
I throw it on
when I don’t care how I look.

1017
01:06:03.085 --> 01:06:04.920
-Now. carry on. you crazy kids.

1018
01:06:05.003 --> 01:06:06.213
-Okay.
-Thank you.

1019
01:06:06.296 --> 01:06:07.464
-Enjoy.
-Thanks.

1020
01:06:07.547 --> 01:06:11.468
He got your Thought Visualizer.

1021
01:06:11.551 --> 01:06:13.970
Wow. Oh. wow.

1022
01:06:14.054 --> 01:06:15.931
Now I’m impressed.

1023
01:06:16.014 --> 01:06:18.850
Maybe. just maybe. hell...

1024
01:06:18.934 --> 01:06:21.520
is not such a horrible place.

1025
01:06:21.603 --> 01:06:23.063
Whenever I hear about.

1026
01:06:23.146 --> 01:06:25.857
"Oh. my God.
boiling oil in hell."

1027
01:06:25.941 --> 01:06:30.320
my first expectation is
wild partying. barbecue.

1028
01:06:30.404 --> 01:06:34.282
-sexual orgies. alcohol.
and so on and so on. -

1029
01:06:34.366 --> 01:06:37.327
What if this is
the real life in hell?

1030
01:06:37.411 --> 01:06:39.788
And what if. in hell.

1031
01:06:39.871 --> 01:06:43.959
from time to time.
some devil’s representative

1032
01:06:44.042 --> 01:06:47.629
comes to the people having a
good time there and tells them.

1033
01:06:47.713 --> 01:06:50.799
"Listen. guys. now we will be
for a quarter of an hour

1034
01:06:50.882 --> 01:06:56.179
observed by heaven. so please
pretend that you suffer."

1035
01:07:04.062 --> 01:07:07.107
-Hey. I’m glad
I caught you alone. -Yeah.

1036
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:08.900
There’s something
I want to tell you.

1037
01:07:08.984 --> 01:07:10.777
Word on the street is
there’ve been problems

1038
01:07:10.861 --> 01:07:12.404
with Isabel’s research.

1039
01:07:12.487 --> 01:07:15.490
You heard anything?
You know anything about that?

1040
01:07:15.574 --> 01:07:16.616
No. I...

1041
01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:18.118
I’ve gotten a good feeling.

1042
01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:20.579
Okay.
We all want her to succeed.

1043
01:07:20.662 --> 01:07:23.915
but this is her reputation
on the line.

1044
01:07:29.546 --> 01:07:31.548
-What did he say?
-

1045
01:07:31.631 --> 01:07:33.800
What did he want?

1046
01:07:39.473 --> 01:07:41.391
What did he say to you?

1047
01:07:41.475 --> 01:07:45.228
He said that everybody
really wants you to succeed.

1048
01:07:50.317 --> 01:07:52.110
-Really? -I don’t think
that’s a bad thing

1049
01:07:52.194 --> 01:07:53.820
that everybody wants you
to succeed.

1050
01:07:53.904 --> 01:07:56.198
Ah. then why didn’t you
tell me what he was saying?

1051
01:07:56.281 --> 01:07:57.991
This is bullshit.
You think I believe that?

1052
01:07:58.074 --> 01:08:00.535
-You think I’m stupid?
-Isabel. he came up to me...

1053
01:08:00.619 --> 01:08:03.580
You think I don’t know that
these people are laughing at me?

1054
01:08:03.663 --> 01:08:05.582
What the fuck
are you looking at?

1055
01:08:05.665 --> 01:08:07.250
Isabel. Isabel.
Hey. hey. hey. hey. hey.

1056
01:08:07.334 --> 01:08:09.503
No. no. no. no. no. no. no. no.
Nobody here believes in me.

1057
01:08:09.586 --> 01:08:11.463
-They want you to succeed.
-Yeah. right.

1058
01:08:11.546 --> 01:08:13.089
Don’t say "nobody here."
I’m here.

1059
01:08:13.173 --> 01:08:14.549
-You’re taking their side!
-Listen.

1060
01:08:14.633 --> 01:08:17.093
I’m here. and I believe in you.

1061
01:08:17.177 --> 01:08:18.845
Right?

1062
01:08:22.516 --> 01:08:25.519
I believe in everything
that you’re doing.

1063
01:08:28.355 --> 01:08:31.900
Your patience with me
is a thing of beauty.

1064
01:08:31.983 --> 01:08:34.820
Let’s get out of here.

1065
01:08:34.903 --> 01:08:37.072
My grandmother used to say.

1066
01:08:37.155 --> 01:08:40.450
"The universe is sitting
on the back of a tortoise."

1067
01:08:40.534 --> 01:08:42.369
And I would ask Granny.

1068
01:08:42.452 --> 01:08:44.621
"What is that tortoise
standing on?"

1069
01:08:44.704 --> 01:08:47.916
She replied
with quite confidence.

1070
01:08:47.999 --> 01:08:50.126
"Another tortoise.

1071
01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:52.921
"And that one stands
on another tortoise.

1072
01:08:53.004 --> 01:08:55.924
And that one. another tortoise."

1073
01:08:56.007 --> 01:09:01.471
It turns out
it’s turtles all the way down.

1074
01:09:02.764 --> 01:09:04.724
I wouldn’t go near him. ma’am.

1075
01:09:04.808 --> 01:09:07.060
He could be unpredictable.

1076
01:09:43.263 --> 01:09:45.098
Whew.

1077
01:09:46.141 --> 01:09:48.101
It’s a little cold.

1078
01:09:48.184 --> 01:09:49.769
Was not expecting that.

1079
01:09:49.853 --> 01:09:52.355
Complaining already.

1080
01:09:52.439 --> 01:09:55.150
I’m fine. It’s just chilly.

1081
01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:57.819
I get one shot at this.

1082
01:09:57.903 --> 01:09:59.821
One shot.

1083
01:09:59.905 --> 01:10:02.240
I’m gonna show these arrogant.

1084
01:10:02.324 --> 01:10:05.285
patronizing son of a bitches

1085
01:10:05.368 --> 01:10:10.290
that access to the brainbox--
it’s a human right.

1086
01:10:17.255 --> 01:10:19.382
Publish now. Stop being afraid.

1087
01:10:19.466 --> 01:10:21.509
Just get it out there
and let people decide then.

1088
01:10:21.593 --> 01:10:24.846
We have to go back
into the brainbox. Greg.

1089
01:10:24.930 --> 01:10:27.223
I need complete data.

1090
01:10:27.307 --> 01:10:29.684
We need to finish the cycle.

1091
01:10:29.768 --> 01:10:32.604
You have enough data. Isabel.

1092
01:10:32.687 --> 01:10:35.357
Not to mention the fact
that I’m not going back in.

1093
01:10:37.067 --> 01:10:41.821
Just stop doubting yourself.

1094
01:10:41.905 --> 01:10:45.408
Why do you care so much
what they think?

1095
01:10:45.492 --> 01:10:47.702
Put it out there.

1096
01:10:47.786 --> 01:10:49.537
They’re gonna think it’s great.

1097
01:10:51.665 --> 01:10:53.875
And if they don’t...

1098
01:10:54.793 --> 01:10:57.504
And if they don’t?

1099
01:10:57.587 --> 01:11:02.050
Then here we are.
right here. together.

1100
01:11:05.804 --> 01:11:08.682
Weren’t you telling me
that we were soul mates?

1101
01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:14.938
Would you let me
interview you onstage?

1102
01:11:18.108 --> 01:11:20.777
It would be my honor.

1103
01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:24.030
Our presenter.
Dr. Isabel Clemens.

1104
01:11:24.114 --> 01:11:27.158
pioneered brainbox simulations.

1105
01:11:27.242 --> 01:11:30.745
ugly. simulated worlds
that users can jack into

1106
01:11:30.829 --> 01:11:34.541
in order to generate
appreciation for the real world.

1107
01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:35.959
-Dr. Clemens.
-

1108
01:11:36.042 --> 01:11:37.252
Thank you very much.

1109
01:11:39.254 --> 01:11:41.381
What is bliss?

1110
01:11:41.464 --> 01:11:43.425
Bliss is not a feeling.

1111
01:11:43.508 --> 01:11:45.010
It’s not a place.

1112
01:11:45.093 --> 01:11:48.805
Bliss is a state of mind
that can only be achieved

1113
01:11:48.888 --> 01:11:51.558
by understanding the contrast

1114
01:11:51.641 --> 01:11:54.894
with the opposite state of mind.

1115
01:11:54.978 --> 01:12:00.066
But the proof is in the pudding.

1116
01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:02.610
Please meet my pudding.

1117
01:12:02.694 --> 01:12:04.821
Dr. Wittle.

1118
01:12:07.032 --> 01:12:09.951
Please take a seat. Dr. Wittle.

1119
01:12:10.035 --> 01:12:14.039
Before we have a volunteer
connected to the brainbox.

1120
01:12:14.122 --> 01:12:16.958
we always ask
a series of questions.

1121
01:12:17.042 --> 01:12:20.378
And now I will ask Dr. Wittle
the same questions

1122
01:12:20.462 --> 01:12:25.091
so we can compare his responses
to the previous ones.

1123
01:12:25.175 --> 01:12:29.012
Dr. Wittle.
how do you feel right now?

1124
01:12:37.645 --> 01:12:39.939
I feel great.
I’m happy to be here.

1125
01:12:40.023 --> 01:12:44.944
And thank you
for the nice reception.

1126
01:12:45.028 --> 01:12:46.946
Dr. Wittle... -Yes.

1127
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:48.698
...how do you feel right now?

1128
01:12:48.782 --> 01:12:51.117
Fine. Great.

1129
01:12:51.201 --> 01:12:52.660
Yeah. sure.

1130
01:12:52.744 --> 01:12:54.788
I mean. is that really
the first question.

1131
01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:58.208
or are we just bullshitting
till you start?

1132
01:13:01.753 --> 01:13:04.214
Any complaints. Dr. Wittle?

1133
01:13:04.297 --> 01:13:06.508
No. None at all.

1134
01:13:06.591 --> 01:13:11.179
I feel like I’ve died
and gone to heaven.

1135
01:13:11.262 --> 01:13:13.640
Without the dying part.

1136
01:13:13.723 --> 01:13:15.391
Dr. Wittle...

1137
01:13:15.475 --> 01:13:17.685
-Yes.
-...do you have any complaints?

1138
01:13:17.769 --> 01:13:20.355
Other than being your lab rat?

1139
01:13:20.438 --> 01:13:23.274
Just the usual
ups and downs of life.

1140
01:13:23.358 --> 01:13:24.609
Um...

1141
01:13:24.692 --> 01:13:26.820
I mean. can I... should I
be petty for a second?

1142
01:13:26.903 --> 01:13:28.238
I’m a little frustrated.

1143
01:13:28.321 --> 01:13:29.948
I can’t get
the pool temperature.

1144
01:13:30.031 --> 01:13:31.574
you know. to work.

1145
01:13:31.658 --> 01:13:34.452
I mean. how fucking difficult
is it to get a pool heated

1146
01:13:34.536 --> 01:13:36.955
to. uh. something where you
don’t feel like you’re joining

1147
01:13:37.038 --> 01:13:39.499
the Polar Bear Club
when you jump in?

1148
01:13:42.127 --> 01:13:43.545
Dr. Wittle.

1149
01:13:43.628 --> 01:13:45.880
do you feel like
you are lacking anything

1150
01:13:45.964 --> 01:13:48.466
or anyone
in your life right now?

1151
01:14:19.205 --> 01:14:21.207
Dr. Wittle?

1152
01:14:22.375 --> 01:14:23.585
Greg.

1153
01:14:28.047 --> 01:14:31.301
I don’t feel like
I’m lacking anything.

1154
01:14:33.845 --> 01:14:36.264
Dr. Wittle.
-Yes. Dr. Clemens.

1155
01:14:36.347 --> 01:14:38.683
Do you feel like
you are lacking anything

1156
01:14:38.766 --> 01:14:41.686
or anyone
in your life right now?

1157
01:14:43.521 --> 01:14:47.025
That’s a...
that’s a dumb question.

1158
01:14:47.108 --> 01:14:49.319
I’m kidding. I’m just joking.

1159
01:14:49.402 --> 01:14:51.571
Please answer and be honest.

1160
01:14:51.654 --> 01:14:54.908
-That’s how this works.
- Okay.

1161
01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:56.284
That’s how this works.

1162
01:14:56.367 --> 01:14:59.078
Um... yes.

1163
01:15:00.455 --> 01:15:02.415
Yeah. there is
something missing.

1164
01:15:02.498 --> 01:15:04.751
but I don’t want
to talk about it.

1165
01:15:07.879 --> 01:15:10.173
Well. as you can see.

1166
01:15:10.256 --> 01:15:15.011
this once frustrated
and grumpy man...

1167
01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:20.642
...is now a man
full of wonder and...

1168
01:15:22.685 --> 01:15:25.313
...and appreciation

1169
01:15:25.396 --> 01:15:30.610
and a hunger for tasting
every breath of life.

1170
01:15:38.493 --> 01:15:40.036
Thank you. Thank you.

1171
01:15:40.119 --> 01:15:41.621
-

1172
01:15:41.704 --> 01:15:44.082
Congratulations. Isabel.
You proved everybody wrong.

1173
01:15:44.165 --> 01:15:45.583
Thank you so much.

1174
01:15:45.667 --> 01:15:47.293
Listen. I read your thesis.

1175
01:15:47.377 --> 01:15:50.171
and I’m gonna submit it
to nature and science magazines

1176
01:15:50.255 --> 01:15:52.257
and hope they put it
on the cover.

1177
01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:53.841
-It’s fantastic.
-Oh...

1178
01:15:53.925 --> 01:15:56.219
-I don’t know what to say.
-Hang on.

1179
01:15:56.302 --> 01:15:58.638
There may be a chaired position
in your future.

1180
01:15:59.889 --> 01:16:01.849
Oh. I have to tell Greg.

1181
01:16:01.933 --> 01:16:04.143
Has anybody seen Dr. Wittle?

1182
01:16:04.227 --> 01:16:05.520
-Thank you.
-Sure.

1183
01:16:05.603 --> 01:16:07.105
-Hey.
-And for you. sir?

1184
01:16:07.188 --> 01:16:09.440
-Cabernet Sauvignon.
-

1185
01:16:13.987 --> 01:16:15.947
Champagne.

1186
01:16:31.045 --> 01:16:32.964
Wait. What...

1187
01:16:33.047 --> 01:16:34.215
Excuse me.

1188
01:16:34.299 --> 01:16:35.425
Wait. let me just say hello.

1189
01:16:35.508 --> 01:16:36.759
Dr. Clemens.
-Hey.

1190
01:16:36.843 --> 01:16:38.553
Where did the initial idea
come from?

1191
01:16:38.636 --> 01:16:39.804
What was the germ?

1192
01:16:39.887 --> 01:16:41.389
-Yeah...
-Yes. congratulations. Doctor.

1193
01:16:41.472 --> 01:16:43.766
Thank you. Thank you
very much. -Lovely work.

1194
01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:46.436
Um. I got to go
find someone right now.

1195
01:16:47.687 --> 01:16:49.063
Hey. please. just stop.

1196
01:16:49.147 --> 01:16:51.107
I just want... I just want
to hear your voice.

1197
01:16:51.190 --> 01:16:52.775
Are...

1198
01:16:52.859 --> 01:16:55.987
Are you really here
in this place?

1199
01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:58.489
Yes.

1200
01:16:58.573 --> 01:17:00.116
I’m here with you.

1201
01:17:00.199 --> 01:17:02.285
So you’re real.

1202
01:17:02.368 --> 01:17:03.911
Yes. I’m real.

1203
01:17:03.995 --> 01:17:05.413
You’re in Isabel’s study?

1204
01:17:05.496 --> 01:17:06.998
You’re in Dr. Clemens’ study?

1205
01:17:07.081 --> 01:17:08.249
You’re one of the volunteers?

1206
01:17:08.333 --> 01:17:10.209
-My name is Emily.
-No. I know.

1207
01:17:10.293 --> 01:17:11.210
I’m Emily.

1208
01:17:11.294 --> 01:17:12.545
I know who you are.

1209
01:17:12.628 --> 01:17:14.589
but how are you out here
in the real world?

1210
01:17:14.672 --> 01:17:16.299
I’m your daughter.

1211
01:17:18.259 --> 01:17:21.429
I don’t think I have
a real daughter

1212
01:17:21.512 --> 01:17:23.473
out here in the real world.

1213
01:17:23.556 --> 01:17:27.518
Your name is Greg Wittle.

1214
01:17:28.561 --> 01:17:31.939
You have a son and a daughter.

1215
01:17:32.023 --> 01:17:34.400
Arthur and Emily.

1216
01:17:34.484 --> 01:17:36.069
You’re not thinking clearly

1217
01:17:36.152 --> 01:17:38.654
because your head’s
not on straight.

1218
01:17:41.366 --> 01:17:44.494
I’ve been to your tent. Daddy.

1219
01:17:50.291 --> 01:17:52.293
It’s okay.

1220
01:17:56.005 --> 01:17:59.050
Yeah. it’s just hard
to figure out what’s what.

1221
01:18:00.385 --> 01:18:01.928
’Cause it starts to feel
like there’s. like...

1222
01:18:02.011 --> 01:18:03.554
it’s almost like
a trick being played.

1223
01:18:03.638 --> 01:18:05.765
Um...

1224
01:18:07.433 --> 01:18:10.686
When I was six.

1225
01:18:10.770 --> 01:18:13.856
you. uh... you were
tucking me into bed. and...

1226
01:18:15.441 --> 01:18:17.068
I said. "Careful. Careful.

1227
01:18:17.151 --> 01:18:19.070
I don’t want you
to mess up my braids."

1228
01:18:19.153 --> 01:18:23.074
And you said. "My love.
I can’t mess up your brains.

1229
01:18:23.157 --> 01:18:27.203
They’re inside your head.
protected by your skeleton."

1230
01:18:27.286 --> 01:18:31.749
And I said. "No. my braids. Dad.

1231
01:18:31.833 --> 01:18:34.877
My braids. not my brains."

1232
01:18:34.961 --> 01:18:38.423
Braids. Braids.

1233
01:18:38.506 --> 01:18:40.758
Braids. not brains.

1234
01:18:40.842 --> 01:18:42.969
You remember.

1235
01:18:43.052 --> 01:18:45.179
Yes. I remember.

1236
01:18:54.021 --> 01:18:55.565
Dr. Clemens.
tell us about the germ.

1237
01:18:55.648 --> 01:18:56.899
-What do you know about it?
-

1238
01:18:56.983 --> 01:18:59.694
Dr. Clemens posits that

1239
01:18:59.777 --> 01:19:02.864
these memory echoes
from the brainbox world

1240
01:19:02.947 --> 01:19:04.490
will fade away.

1241
01:19:04.574 --> 01:19:08.744
They’re just a side effect from
not having enough blue crystals.

1242
01:19:08.828 --> 01:19:12.373
-

1243
01:19:13.458 --> 01:19:15.293
One of these days.

1244
01:19:15.376 --> 01:19:19.589
you’re going to have to choose
between these worlds.

1245
01:19:19.672 --> 01:19:23.259
and maybe. somehow.

1246
01:19:23.342 --> 01:19:25.261
to you.

1247
01:19:25.344 --> 01:19:28.139
they’re both real.

1248
01:19:30.099 --> 01:19:33.519
So just... just...

1249
01:19:34.687 --> 01:19:36.856
...just do what’s best
for you. okay?

1250
01:19:38.357 --> 01:19:39.901
Greg!
- Dr. Clemens!

1251
01:19:39.984 --> 01:19:42.278
-

1252
01:19:47.492 --> 01:19:49.202
Isabel!

1253
01:19:49.285 --> 01:19:51.120
Get off me!

1254
01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:55.458
Isabel!

1255
01:19:55.541 --> 01:19:56.542
Greg!

1256
01:19:56.626 --> 01:19:58.294
Greg! Greg!

1257
01:20:07.386 --> 01:20:09.222
-

1258
01:20:10.848 --> 01:20:12.725
Shit.

1259
01:20:15.603 --> 01:20:17.063
Did you see that?
I used the powers.

1260
01:20:17.146 --> 01:20:18.397
But that’s impossible.

1261
01:20:18.481 --> 01:20:20.274
-This shouldn’t work here.
-

1262
01:20:20.358 --> 01:20:23.027
-

1263
01:20:30.201 --> 01:20:32.578
Greg. this is really bad.

1264
01:20:37.792 --> 01:20:40.461
Poverty’s killing us!

1265
01:20:40.545 --> 01:20:42.213
We have to get to the lab!

1266
01:20:42.296 --> 01:20:43.631
We need more blue crystals.

1267
01:20:43.714 --> 01:20:45.216
But why would we go back in?

1268
01:20:45.299 --> 01:20:46.759
That’s a terrible idea.

1269
01:20:46.842 --> 01:20:48.219
We took eight instead of ten.

1270
01:20:48.302 --> 01:20:49.762
But you said
that was theoretical.

1271
01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:50.930
It was just an estimate.

1272
01:20:51.013 --> 01:20:52.682
Well. I guess I got that

1273
01:20:52.765 --> 01:20:54.350
little fucking detail wrong.
didn’t I?

1274
01:20:54.433 --> 01:20:56.435
No. you’ve got to explain
anything to me!

1275
01:20:56.519 --> 01:20:57.603
This is what I know.

1276
01:20:57.687 --> 01:20:59.605
The brainbox cells
must have worked

1277
01:20:59.689 --> 01:21:01.065
their way into our head.

1278
01:21:01.148 --> 01:21:02.692
It’s as if we are bringing

1279
01:21:02.775 --> 01:21:04.944
some of the simulation
here with us

1280
01:21:05.027 --> 01:21:07.154
even when we’re disconnected.

1281
01:21:07.238 --> 01:21:09.031
Okay. so how do we fix it?

1282
01:21:09.115 --> 01:21:11.576
By taking ten blue
crystals each. Liang. let’s go.

1283
01:21:11.659 --> 01:21:13.411
But don’t they have crystals
here in the lab?

1284
01:21:13.494 --> 01:21:14.870
They don’t exist out here.

1285
01:21:14.954 --> 01:21:16.247
We need to go back.

1286
01:21:16.330 --> 01:21:18.583
They’re only manufactured
inside of there.

1287
01:21:18.666 --> 01:21:19.959
Dr. Clemens. there’s a problem.

1288
01:21:20.042 --> 01:21:21.711
The main brain gamma is low.

1289
01:21:21.794 --> 01:21:23.421
Liang. we’re leaving now!

1290
01:21:23.504 --> 01:21:25.673
Well. I can only make it
ride up for a couple seconds.

1291
01:21:25.756 --> 01:21:27.091
Are you ready?

1292
01:21:27.174 --> 01:21:28.884
Dr. Clemens.
what about the study?

1293
01:21:28.968 --> 01:21:30.219
Your mission?

1294
01:21:30.303 --> 01:21:33.306
Shut the fuck up
and press the button already!

1295
01:21:33.389 --> 01:21:35.600
We’ll deal with it later.

1296
01:21:59.123 --> 01:22:00.541
Baby!

1297
01:22:00.625 --> 01:22:02.043
Baby. we’re back in.

1298
01:22:02.126 --> 01:22:03.628
Come on.

1299
01:22:03.711 --> 01:22:05.880
Let’s go find Kendo.

1300
01:22:15.473 --> 01:22:16.724
Kendo here?

1301
01:22:16.807 --> 01:22:19.018
-You’re not allowed in here.
-Zip it.

1302
01:22:20.227 --> 01:22:22.313
All right. you fake fucks.

1303
01:22:22.396 --> 01:22:24.607
Where’s Kendo? We need 20 blues.

1304
01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:26.859
-No one’s got blues.
-Kendo will.

1305
01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:28.194
Where is he? Hmm?

1306
01:22:28.277 --> 01:22:30.404
-Where is he?
- Hey. hey. Whoa. whoa.

1307
01:22:31.572 --> 01:22:32.907
Let’s start again.

1308
01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:35.576
Where is Kendo? Hmm?

1309
01:22:38.537 --> 01:22:39.872
Where is he?

1310
01:22:44.585 --> 01:22:46.003
Hey.

1311
01:22:46.087 --> 01:22:48.255
What are you doing alive?
Hey. Bjorn!

1312
01:22:48.339 --> 01:22:49.632
-Someone call security.
-Okay.

1313
01:22:49.715 --> 01:22:50.925
I’m gonna get it. Guys!

1314
01:22:51.008 --> 01:22:52.385
I saw you fall out the window.

1315
01:22:52.468 --> 01:22:54.220
He jumped out the window!
You saw it. too!

1316
01:22:54.303 --> 01:22:55.638
He fell right over there.

1317
01:22:55.721 --> 01:22:57.056
-right out that window!
-Should I. should I call...

1318
01:22:57.139 --> 01:22:58.391
-Bjorn. look at me.
-I’m out of here.

1319
01:22:58.474 --> 01:22:59.642
Look at me.
No. no. I’m calm. I’m calm.

1320
01:22:59.725 --> 01:23:00.851
-Do you want me to call her?
-You saw him.

1321
01:23:00.935 --> 01:23:02.603
-Greg. get some food.
-What are you doing?

1322
01:23:02.687 --> 01:23:04.105
Don’t do that to me!

1323
01:23:04.188 --> 01:23:06.774
-Come on. come on. come on...
-No. no. Just tell me why!

1324
01:23:06.857 --> 01:23:07.733
-Here...
-Now! Now! Move!

1325
01:23:07.817 --> 01:23:09.610
Let’s go! Come on!

1326
01:23:09.694 --> 01:23:11.195
I found Kendo.

1327
01:23:11.278 --> 01:23:12.321
Bjorn’s alive.

1328
01:23:12.405 --> 01:23:13.531
My boss is alive.

1329
01:23:13.614 --> 01:23:15.324
-Did you see that?
-Oh. my God.

1330
01:23:15.408 --> 01:23:17.660
That’s an FGP.

1331
01:23:17.743 --> 01:23:20.204
They rebooted him! Come on.

1332
01:23:20.287 --> 01:23:22.289
Kendo’s at Doc Henry’s?

1333
01:23:22.373 --> 01:23:24.125
No. but our car is.

1334
01:23:24.208 --> 01:23:26.335
Fake. fake. fake!

1335
01:23:27.837 --> 01:23:30.673
Hello. beauties.

1336
01:23:30.756 --> 01:23:33.759
Has anybody got some Tabasco?

1337
01:23:33.843 --> 01:23:37.012
Tabasco? Bitch. what the fuck
you talking about?

1338
01:23:37.096 --> 01:23:38.222
Mace.

1339
01:23:38.305 --> 01:23:39.765
For the bad boys.

1340
01:23:39.849 --> 01:23:41.809
Get out of here
with your fucked-up teeth.

1341
01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:46.689
Give this bitch a toothbrush.

1342
01:23:46.772 --> 01:23:49.400
Yeah. I got fucked-up teeth.
but I also got a 20.

1343
01:23:49.483 --> 01:23:51.527
Give it to me. Who has it?

1344
01:23:55.531 --> 01:23:57.074
Fake. fake. fake. fake!

1345
01:23:57.158 --> 01:23:59.368
Real!

1346
01:24:01.495 --> 01:24:05.124
Hey. blondie. two for one.

1347
01:24:05.207 --> 01:24:06.959
Hey.

1348
01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:08.377
You in the mood?

1349
01:24:08.461 --> 01:24:10.379
It’s the only reason
I come to this shithole.

1350
01:24:17.178 --> 01:24:19.972
So. what is it gonna be?

1351
01:24:20.055 --> 01:24:23.476
Uh. let’s have a BJ
and a finger in the butt.

1352
01:24:23.559 --> 01:24:25.144
-Sure.
- All right.

1353
01:24:25.227 --> 01:24:27.521
-Let me get my lipstick.
-All right.

1354
01:24:27.605 --> 01:24:30.107
-

1355
01:24:37.782 --> 01:24:39.784
No. no. the wallet! The wallet!

1356
01:24:41.577 --> 01:24:43.662
Yes! Blues!

1357
01:24:43.746 --> 01:24:45.873
-Here we go!
-

1358
01:24:45.956 --> 01:24:47.750
Look what I found.

1359
01:24:49.418 --> 01:24:50.920
-

1360
01:24:51.003 --> 01:24:52.379
Yes!

1361
01:25:04.391 --> 01:25:05.935
Okay. philosophical question:

1362
01:25:06.018 --> 01:25:08.020
Kendo’s real.
so if Kendo... if he...

1363
01:25:08.103 --> 01:25:09.522
Yeah. Kendo is real.

1364
01:25:09.605 --> 01:25:12.691
but if he dies here.
he doesn’t die out there.

1365
01:25:12.775 --> 01:25:14.401
I’m not gonna do
anything to him.

1366
01:25:14.485 --> 01:25:15.861
Stop looking at me that way.

1367
01:25:18.030 --> 01:25:19.657
Dr. Clemens.

1368
01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:22.701
Kendo. we need blue crystals.

1369
01:25:22.785 --> 01:25:24.370
I don’t have time
to explain it to you.

1370
01:25:24.453 --> 01:25:26.288
but shit’s falling apart
one level up.

1371
01:25:26.372 --> 01:25:27.790
-Give them to me. Go get them!
-Okay.

1372
01:25:27.873 --> 01:25:29.166
Okay. sure. you got it.

1373
01:25:29.250 --> 01:25:30.209
Go get them!

1374
01:25:30.292 --> 01:25:31.669
-Now!
-Okay.

1375
01:25:31.752 --> 01:25:34.296
I have them on me. right here...

1376
01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:36.006
Ah. fuck!

1377
01:25:36.090 --> 01:25:38.467
Dr. Clemens. what are you doing?

1378
01:25:42.054 --> 01:25:44.932
-Hey. Hey!
-I thought he went for a gun.

1379
01:25:45.015 --> 01:25:47.017
but he actually did have them.

1380
01:25:47.101 --> 01:25:49.395
-Sorry. Kendo.
-Sorry?

1381
01:25:49.478 --> 01:25:51.146
I mean. it starts to feel like

1382
01:25:51.230 --> 01:25:53.399
you’re making this up
as you go along. that...

1383
01:25:53.482 --> 01:25:54.900
He’s fine.

1384
01:25:54.984 --> 01:25:57.403
Maybe just a mild stomachache.
but he’s fine.

1385
01:25:57.486 --> 01:25:58.988
-

1386
01:25:59.071 --> 01:26:00.531
Police!

1387
01:26:00.614 --> 01:26:01.907
Go!
-Hold it!

1388
01:26:01.991 --> 01:26:03.117
-Stay where you are!
- Go this way!

1389
01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.910
Stop!

1390
01:26:04.994 --> 01:26:06.453
This is fake.

1391
01:26:06.537 --> 01:26:08.080
-This is fake. This is fake.
-

1392
01:26:08.163 --> 01:26:09.623
Come on. can’t you run faster?

1393
01:26:09.707 --> 01:26:11.041
This is way too much running.

1394
01:26:11.125 --> 01:26:12.668
Can’t we just take
the blues here?

1395
01:26:12.751 --> 01:26:14.336
No. we need to get the device

1396
01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:15.629
to take it through the nose.

1397
01:26:15.713 --> 01:26:17.256
We need to get to the tarp home.

1398
01:26:17.339 --> 01:26:18.507
Why didn’t we get it

1399
01:26:18.591 --> 01:26:19.925
before we started
shooting people?

1400
01:26:26.181 --> 01:26:27.516
Hurry. hurry. hurry. hurry.

1401
01:26:36.942 --> 01:26:38.652
Okay. okay.

1402
01:26:38.736 --> 01:26:40.070
I got a call.

1403
01:26:40.154 --> 01:26:42.531
He was panhandling
outside of his old office.

1404
01:26:42.615 --> 01:26:44.366
Will you come with me. please?

1405
01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:46.285
I need you.

1406
01:27:04.511 --> 01:27:06.221
We need to take ten each.

1407
01:27:11.185 --> 01:27:12.394
There’s not enough!

1408
01:27:12.478 --> 01:27:13.687
What do you mean?

1409
01:27:13.771 --> 01:27:14.855
-There’s not enough!
-Count ’em again.

1410
01:27:14.939 --> 01:27:16.231
There’s not enough!

1411
01:27:16.315 --> 01:27:18.067
-Come out with your hands up.
-What?

1412
01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:20.402
We’re so fucked!

1413
01:27:20.486 --> 01:27:21.946
Oh. my God.

1414
01:27:22.029 --> 01:27:23.405
Okay. what does it mean?

1415
01:27:23.489 --> 01:27:25.157
-We’re fucked.
-Yeah. what does it mean?

1416
01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:26.742
We’re so fucked.

1417
01:27:26.825 --> 01:27:28.786
It means that one of us
gets to go home

1418
01:27:28.869 --> 01:27:31.664
-and the other one gets stuck
in this place. -Why? No. no.

1419
01:27:31.747 --> 01:27:33.290
-I’m not staying here.
-We go to...

1420
01:27:33.374 --> 01:27:35.042
-to jail and-and...
-No. No. no. no. no.

1421
01:27:35.125 --> 01:27:36.335
-...for good.
-Listen to me.

1422
01:27:36.418 --> 01:27:38.045
I have to go.

1423
01:27:38.128 --> 01:27:40.422
Okay? I can’t stay here.

1424
01:27:43.425 --> 01:27:45.511
Don’t worry. It’s okay.

1425
01:27:45.594 --> 01:27:46.971
It’s okay.

1426
01:27:47.054 --> 01:27:49.598
We see you behind the tree.

1427
01:28:00.609 --> 01:28:02.403
-You-you take it.
-Okay.

1428
01:28:02.486 --> 01:28:04.321
And you’re gonna be okay. right?

1429
01:28:04.405 --> 01:28:05.364
Okay.

1430
01:28:06.573 --> 01:28:08.367
I’m gonna...

1431
01:28:11.286 --> 01:28:13.288
-Maybe we can split it.
-Go. go.

1432
01:28:13.372 --> 01:28:15.165
No. no. it won’t work.

1433
01:28:15.249 --> 01:28:16.709
Go. go. Come on.

1434
01:28:18.252 --> 01:28:20.587
I have an idea.

1435
01:28:20.671 --> 01:28:22.214
What if you kill me?

1436
01:28:25.134 --> 01:28:27.177
Yeah. Look.

1437
01:28:27.261 --> 01:28:28.595
Take this.

1438
01:28:28.679 --> 01:28:33.851
Just crush my skull.
and then I meet you back there.

1439
01:28:33.934 --> 01:28:36.103
-I’m not staying here.
-That’s bullshit.

1440
01:28:36.186 --> 01:28:37.604
I’m not gonna do that.

1441
01:28:37.688 --> 01:28:39.106
-Why?
-What if it doesn’t work?

1442
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:40.941
What about Kendo?

1443
01:28:41.025 --> 01:28:42.943
Maybe I killed him.
I don’t know.

1444
01:28:43.027 --> 01:28:45.362
I-I don’t... I don’t know
what to believe.

1445
01:28:45.446 --> 01:28:47.698
Oh. shit.

1446
01:28:47.781 --> 01:28:48.949
Fuck.

1447
01:28:49.033 --> 01:28:50.826
We’re fucking surrounded?

1448
01:28:50.909 --> 01:28:52.953
Down there!
Get your men down there!

1449
01:28:53.037 --> 01:28:54.204
Let’s go!

1450
01:28:54.288 --> 01:28:55.748
We’re in a pickle.

1451
01:28:55.831 --> 01:28:57.332
We’re in a pickle. baby.

1452
01:28:57.416 --> 01:28:58.834
Yeah. we’re in a pickle.

1453
01:29:00.252 --> 01:29:02.004
Okay. Let’s go.

1454
01:29:07.551 --> 01:29:08.927
You’re not coming?

1455
01:29:09.011 --> 01:29:11.430
I’m-a be right here.

1456
01:29:11.513 --> 01:29:13.182
I’m here for you.

1457
01:29:13.265 --> 01:29:14.433
Thank you.

1458
01:29:21.774 --> 01:29:23.525
Fuck!

1459
01:29:25.277 --> 01:29:27.571
Shit.

1460
01:29:27.654 --> 01:29:29.239
This is horrible.

1461
01:29:29.323 --> 01:29:33.160
This is... this is
a fucking nightmare.

1462
01:29:37.039 --> 01:29:39.124
It’s my fault.

1463
01:29:39.208 --> 01:29:40.417
I created this.

1464
01:29:40.501 --> 01:29:42.252
I created this shit.

1465
01:29:42.336 --> 01:29:43.337
Just me.

1466
01:30:12.574 --> 01:30:15.244
But it’s also kind of beautiful.

1467
01:30:18.163 --> 01:30:19.915
It is.

1468
01:30:19.998 --> 01:30:22.501
Look. I mean.
even with the cops coming

1469
01:30:22.584 --> 01:30:24.169
and with us running and just...

1470
01:30:24.253 --> 01:30:27.131
You know. everyone’s playing
their part. and we’re all...

1471
01:30:27.214 --> 01:30:29.007
like. we never know
how it’s gonna end.

1472
01:30:29.091 --> 01:30:31.218
One minute. we’re
roller-skating and laughing.

1473
01:30:31.301 --> 01:30:32.845
Remember?

1474
01:30:32.928 --> 01:30:35.305
Yeah. and then the next minute.
can’t even afford a sandwich.

1475
01:30:35.389 --> 01:30:37.099
and then the next minute.
you never know.

1476
01:30:37.182 --> 01:30:39.601
That’s what I love about here
and what you created.

1477
01:30:39.685 --> 01:30:42.146
You don’t know
what’s gonna happen.

1478
01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:44.273
It’s fucked-up.

1479
01:30:44.356 --> 01:30:46.191
And it’s great.

1480
01:30:46.275 --> 01:30:48.360
And I’m not leaving.

1481
01:30:52.781 --> 01:30:54.491
I’m not leaving.

1482
01:30:55.534 --> 01:30:57.494
Dad!

1483
01:30:58.579 --> 01:31:00.247
Dad!

1484
01:31:02.916 --> 01:31:04.668
Dad!

1485
01:31:06.086 --> 01:31:08.046
Keep an eye out!
Stay back! Stay back!

1486
01:31:08.130 --> 01:31:09.882
-No! No. no. no! Please wait!
No. wait! -Come on. go.

1487
01:31:09.965 --> 01:31:11.800
-Get in the car.
-Wait! Wait!

1488
01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:17.598
Dad!

1489
01:31:42.331 --> 01:31:44.583
I’m sorry.

1490
01:31:51.715 --> 01:31:54.134
She’s beautiful.

1491
01:32:17.616 --> 01:32:19.034
Go.

1492
01:32:20.202 --> 01:32:21.870
Hey!

1493
01:32:21.954 --> 01:32:24.081
Come on. motherfuckers!

1494
01:32:24.164 --> 01:32:26.375
Let’s go!

1495
01:32:35.884 --> 01:32:39.054
Drop what’s in your hand.
Ma’am. show what’s in your hand.

1496
01:32:39.137 --> 01:32:41.348
Hands in the air.
Let me see your hands.

1497
01:35:39.359 --> 01:35:41.903
This is. uh. Greg’s first time.

1498
01:35:41.987 --> 01:35:44.239
Welcome. Greg.

1499
01:35:44.322 --> 01:35:47.909
In this house. there’s no stigma
for what you’re going through.

1500
01:35:47.993 --> 01:35:50.829
Every person on this planet
can relate

1501
01:35:50.912 --> 01:35:54.291
to wanting to chase bliss.

1502
01:35:54.374 --> 01:35:59.004
It’s an open forum. so you can
say anything you want.

1503
01:35:59.087 --> 01:36:01.298
We’re here to listen.

1504
01:36:51.515 --> 01:36:54.684
This woman says
she’s my daughter.

1505
01:36:56.811 --> 01:36:59.022
And I believe her.

1506
01:37:57.581 --> 01:37:59.165
Hi. Dad.

1507
01:38:01.334 --> 01:38:03.545
Sorry I’m late. I...

1508
01:38:04.921 --> 01:38:08.967
I saw these flowers
on the side of the road.

1509
01:38:09.050 --> 01:38:11.803
I thought they looked nice.
I guess.

1510
01:38:16.224 --> 01:38:18.101
You’re not late. Dad.

1511
01:38:21.688 --> 01:38:23.690
You’re here.

1512
01:38:53.678 --> 01:38:56.848
-

1513
01:39:26.044 --> 01:39:31.716
through these eyes

1514
01:39:33.009 --> 01:39:38.932
morning light

1515
01:40:52.046 --> 01:40:57.886
in the dark
