00:00:31.407 --> 00:00:34.410
(church bells chiming)

4
00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:52.261
(birds cawing)

5
00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:03.898
(sighs softly)

6
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.199
(cheering. excited chatter)

7
00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:24.960
We got a live one.
(chuckles)

8
00:01:25.044 --> 00:01:27.755
(chuckles)
Barely. after that flight.

9
00:01:27.838 --> 00:01:29.089
Last name. first name?

10
00:01:29.173 --> 00:01:30.633
Moore. Jasmine.

11
00:01:30.716 --> 00:01:33.219
All right. you are in room...

12
00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:36.806
Guys.

13
00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:40.726
She got the room.

14
00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:45.731
-Should we tell her?
-What's wrong?

15
00:01:45.815 --> 00:01:47.525
Welcome to Ancaster.

16
00:02:08.921 --> 00:02:10.756
(sighs)

17
00:02:16.846 --> 00:02:18.472
Buildings and Grounds?

18
00:02:19.723 --> 00:02:21.058
This is Gail Bishop.

19
00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:23.435
Yeah. my door... the lock is jammed.

20
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.689
-Well. of course I tried. Obvi...
-(door opens)

21
00:02:26.772 --> 00:02:28.774
(door creaking)

22
00:02:33.821 --> 00:02:36.282
(suitcase thumping)

23
00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:29.209
Shit.

24
00:03:29.293 --> 00:03:30.878
(mutters quietly)

25
00:03:30.961 --> 00:03:32.630
-You scared me.
-Sorry.

26
00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:35.758
-You must be Jasmine.
-Yeah.

27
00:03:36.926 --> 00:03:38.093
I'm Amelia.

28
00:03:38.177 --> 00:03:39.219
Hey.

29
00:03:40.638 --> 00:03:42.264
I like your style.

30
00:03:42.348 --> 00:03:43.641
Thanks.

31
00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:50.314
Legends.

32
00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:53.108
Ancaster College is crowded with them.

33
00:03:53.192 --> 00:03:56.946
When you go to a school
that's nearly as old as the country.

34
00:03:57.029 --> 00:03:59.615
you can expect to hear a few.

35
00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:04.536
Like. maybe you've heard that
FDR was rejected from Ancaster

36
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.331
and had to settle for his safety school...

37
00:04:08.374 --> 00:04:10.501
-Harvard.
-(laughter)

38
00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:12.336
Now. while I can't confirm that.

39
00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:17.841
I can say that two U.S. presidents
and an army of senators

40
00:04:17.925 --> 00:04:20.344
count this school as their alma mater.

41
00:04:21.637 --> 00:04:26.183
Perhaps you've heard of
the legend of Margaret Millett.

42
00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:29.061
a woman hanged for practicing witchcraft

43
00:04:29.144 --> 00:04:31.480
not too far from
where this building stands.

44
00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:33.607
Now. that is true.

45
00:04:33.691 --> 00:04:35.234
But believe me when I say

46
00:04:35.317 --> 00:04:37.778
the only thing
that will haunt you this year

47
00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:39.905
is that extra slice of pizza.

48
00:04:39.989 --> 00:04:41.782
(light laughter)

49
00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:45.119
I consider it a huge honor

50
00:04:45.202 --> 00:04:49.206
to be stepping into the role
of Belleville House master

51
00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.083
for the first time.

52
00:04:52.543 --> 00:04:55.421
As master.
I am more than just a professor.

53
00:04:55.504 --> 00:04:58.549
Consider me a confidante.

54
00:04:58.632 --> 00:05:01.927
an ally. a friend.

55
00:05:02.011 --> 00:05:05.222
And if you ever need anything.
I live right there.

56
00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:08.475
so I'm easy to find.

57
00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:14.023
We start and we close every semester
with something called the primal scream.

58
00:05:14.106 --> 00:05:16.150
Get your lungs ready now.

59
00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:18.277
And my last fact...

60
00:05:23.657 --> 00:05:27.202
You will never go back home again.

61
00:05:27.286 --> 00:05:29.913
When you head
to your hometowns over break.

62
00:05:29.997 --> 00:05:32.207
it will be as visitors.

63
00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:35.586
There is no returning to what came before.

64
00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:39.214
So. all I can say to you now is...

65
00:05:41.258 --> 00:05:43.260
-Welcome home.
-(applause. cheering)

66
00:05:47.181 --> 00:05:49.183
(screaming)

67
00:05:57.733 --> 00:05:59.068
Are we gonna play this? Oh. shit.

68
00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:00.694
Can someone clean that up. please?

69
00:06:00.778 --> 00:06:03.447
The kitchen roll is just there.

70
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.199
Here. Can you do it?

71
00:06:05.282 --> 00:06:06.992
(hip-hop music playing)

72
00:06:07.076 --> 00:06:10.370
Uh. so how do you all know each other?

73
00:06:10.454 --> 00:06:12.748
Oh. okay. well.
we went to school together.

74
00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:15.084
and then Libby went to Dalton.

75
00:06:15.167 --> 00:06:17.336
-Ow! Why?
-I went to Dwight.

76
00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:19.171
Okay. Sorry.

77
00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:21.090
Libby's my friend from camp.

78
00:06:21.173 --> 00:06:23.383
Camp Chappaquiddick.

79
00:06:23.467 --> 00:06:25.219
Dwight. I didn't know you went there.

80
00:06:25.302 --> 00:06:27.054
Dumb White Idiots Getting High Together.

81
00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:28.972
Can we keep on. please?

82
00:06:29.056 --> 00:06:30.724
Yes. ma'am.

83
00:06:30.808 --> 00:06:33.685
Never have I ever...

84
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.606
...joined the mile-high club.

85
00:06:39.066 --> 00:06:41.318
(others whooping)

86
00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:44.071
-- You did not just...
-- Oh.

87
00:06:45.072 --> 00:06:46.949
Not true.
You were not like that.

88
00:06:47.032 --> 00:06:48.617
It happened on Birthright.

89
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.245
Okay. I actually have a good one.

90
00:06:51.328 --> 00:06:52.663
(chuckles)

91
00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:55.582
Never have I ever pissed my pants.

92
00:06:55.666 --> 00:06:57.000
(laughter)

93
00:06:57.084 --> 00:06:59.086
Tonight's not too late to start. (laughs)

94
00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:00.170
Oh?

95
00:07:00.254 --> 00:07:02.089
Uh. I can explain.

96
00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:05.259
Um. long story.
but I sleepwalk-- sometimes.

97
00:07:05.342 --> 00:07:06.927
Oh. my God.
Do you ever sleep-eat?

98
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.929
-I don't think so.
-What?

99
00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:10.722
Um. anyway. last spring.

100
00:07:10.806 --> 00:07:13.684
I spent the night at my friend's house
after prom with a bunch of people...

101
00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:16.436
We had the sickest after-prom.

102
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.355
Amagansett.

103
00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:21.483
Next thing that I know.
her mom is waking me up.

104
00:07:21.567 --> 00:07:23.902
and I'm sitting on top
of an open dryer peeing.

105
00:07:23.986 --> 00:07:26.989
-Fully. like... full stream.
-(chuckles) No!

106
00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:29.032
-Stop. Okay. actually...
-Fully.

107
00:07:29.116 --> 00:07:30.659
-Fully peeing.
-(laughter)

108
00:07:30.742 --> 00:07:32.661
So I didn't just piss my pants.

109
00:07:32.744 --> 00:07:34.246
I pissed everybody's pants.

110
00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:36.290
(laughing):
Who found this girl?

111
00:07:36.373 --> 00:07:38.208
So good.

112
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.547
Shoulders back.

113
00:07:44.882 --> 00:07:49.553
I painted Dean Maroney when he started
as master of Peabody House.

114
00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:51.680
Oh. wow. Nice.

115
00:07:51.763 --> 00:07:53.932
It's quite a step.

116
00:07:54.016 --> 00:07:55.726
(bell dings in distance)

117
00:07:57.728 --> 00:07:59.021
That sound.

118
00:07:59.104 --> 00:08:01.398
It's a good time to stop anyway.

119
00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:04.151
-We can pick back up next week.
-Yeah. okay.

120
00:08:05.194 --> 00:08:06.904
(groans)

121
00:08:06.987 --> 00:08:08.614
(sighs)

122
00:08:20.918 --> 00:08:22.753
Thanks. Josh.

123
00:08:22.836 --> 00:08:25.088
(door closes)

124
00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:30.510
-(bell dinging)
-(footsteps)

125
00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:56.870
(door squeaks)

126
00:09:15.222 --> 00:09:17.057
(dings)

127
00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:51.550
Broccoli there for your nourishment.

128
00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:53.593
-Thank you.
-You want some mac and cheese. baby?

129
00:09:53.677 --> 00:09:54.886
-Yeah. please. Hey.
-Little right there.

130
00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:56.346
Hi. baby. How are you today?

131
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:57.806
Aren't you looking nice today?

132
00:09:57.889 --> 00:09:59.641
All right. Jacob.
How you doing. baby?

133
00:09:59.725 --> 00:10:00.851
Yes. Good to see you.

134
00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:02.227
-Well. have a good one.
-Oh. thank you.

135
00:10:02.311 --> 00:10:03.770
Hello. How are y'all?

136
00:10:03.854 --> 00:10:05.022
-Come on. smile now.
-Hi.

137
00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:06.565
-It's a beautiful day outside.
-Mm-hmm.

138
00:10:06.648 --> 00:10:08.150
How's school going?

139
00:10:08.233 --> 00:10:09.651
-Great.
-Good?

140
00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:22.831
(indistinct chatter. laughter)

141
00:10:36.887 --> 00:10:38.889
(chatter continues)

142
00:10:50.192 --> 00:10:51.943
Okay. that felt derogatory.

143
00:10:52.027 --> 00:10:54.696
-(laughter)
-That was so rude.

144
00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.239
-(laughter stops)
-("Orphan Child" playing)

145
00:10:56.323 --> 00:10:58.116
Oh. chill.
She's not gonna do anything.

146
00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:15.300
Who are you?

147
00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:18.595
Guess.

148
00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:20.722
(chuckles) Okay. Um...

149
00:11:20.806 --> 00:11:22.891
(inhales sharply. exhales)

150
00:11:25.227 --> 00:11:26.603
BeyoncÃ©.

151
00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:28.063
(chuckles softly)

152
00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:29.272
(Tyler chuckles)

153
00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:30.649
A Williams sister.

154
00:11:30.732 --> 00:11:32.776
Serena. maybe Venus.

155
00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:34.528
Nicki Minaj.

156
00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:36.029
-(Tyler laughing)
-Lizzo?

157
00:11:36.113 --> 00:11:38.323
(laughter)

158
00:11:38.407 --> 00:11:40.617
Wrong. wrong and definitely wrong.

159
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:43.203
Oh. my God. game over.
She's my roommate. obviously.

160
00:11:43.286 --> 00:11:44.329
(chuckles)

161
00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:46.915
It's nice to meet you.

162
00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:50.961
I'm Tyler. Hi.

163
00:11:52.003 --> 00:11:53.255
-Hi. Tyler.
-Hey.

164
00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:56.174
Oh. shit. so you live here. too?

165
00:11:56.258 --> 00:11:57.676
-- Duh.
-- Yeah.

166
00:11:57.759 --> 00:11:59.553
-Yeah.
-This room is haunted.

167
00:12:00.554 --> 00:12:02.806
Some chick died here
in the '50s or whatever.

168
00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:04.599
Yeah. Room 302.

169
00:12:04.683 --> 00:12:05.892
Yeah. Look it up.

170
00:12:05.976 --> 00:12:07.894
The whole school's cursed.

171
00:12:07.978 --> 00:12:09.187
By the Witch.

172
00:12:09.271 --> 00:12:12.899
You haven't heard about Margaret Millett
and the witch trials?

173
00:12:12.983 --> 00:12:14.943
Come on.

174
00:12:15.026 --> 00:12:16.945
(laughs):
Okay. you're-you're gonna have to try

175
00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:18.864
a lot harder than that to scare me.

176
00:12:18.947 --> 00:12:21.741
Seriously. it's-it's real.

177
00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:24.661
The Witch chooses a freshman every year.

178
00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:26.663
It could be one of you.

179
00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:29.541
This girl our year. (scoffs) Treasure...

180
00:12:29.624 --> 00:12:31.877
Oh. shit. I forgot about Treasure.

181
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.753
She lost it.

182
00:12:33.837 --> 00:12:35.464
Jumped out the window.

183
00:12:36.506 --> 00:12:37.757
(taps window)

184
00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:40.218
-This window?
-Yep.

185
00:12:40.302 --> 00:12:42.512
I mean. what-what happened?

186
00:12:42.596 --> 00:12:45.599
The Witch shows herself to a freshman.

187
00:12:45.682 --> 00:12:48.268
And then one night.

188
00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:51.563
at33 on the dot.

189
00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:53.482
she takes them with her.

190
00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:56.443
Takes them where?

191
00:12:57.486 --> 00:12:59.404
To hell.

192
00:13:04.743 --> 00:13:07.412
(laughter)

193
00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:15.921
You're so... Oh. my fucking God.

194
00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:20.050
(laughing):
But it's true. It's all true.

195
00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:21.927
-It is true. though. mostly.
-Trade.

196
00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:23.803
Treasure!

197
00:13:23.887 --> 00:13:25.180
-Shut up.
-(laughter)

198
00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:26.723
You're gonna get us in trouble.

199
00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:31.228
Hawthorne went HAM.
I think we can all agree.

200
00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:33.396
I mean. let's just take a look at Pearl.

201
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:38.318
This little girl is 90% symbolism.
ten percent precocious statements.

202
00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:40.111
What do y'all make of her?

203
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:43.031
Professor Beckman?

204
00:13:43.114 --> 00:13:44.491
Call me Liv.

205
00:13:44.574 --> 00:13:45.909
And just chime in.

206
00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:47.410
Raising hands is for high school.

207
00:13:47.494 --> 00:13:48.745
Sorry.

208
00:13:49.913 --> 00:13:53.708
I think it's kind of ironic
that Hester named her Pearl.

209
00:13:53.792 --> 00:13:55.293
How so?

210
00:13:55.377 --> 00:13:57.671
Pearls are associated
with the color white.

211
00:13:57.754 --> 00:14:03.009
so we connect her with purity.
innocence and all.

212
00:14:03.093 --> 00:14:07.430
Pearl should be read as innocent
because of her association with white.

213
00:14:07.514 --> 00:14:08.723
Who agrees?

214
00:14:13.979 --> 00:14:16.398
Well. um. Professor Beckman...

215
00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:17.566
Liv.

216
00:14:17.649 --> 00:14:22.070
I think that. at the time.
the color white was connected with purity.

217
00:14:22.153 --> 00:14:23.613
Symbolically.

218
00:14:23.697 --> 00:14:26.908
But then there was that part
she was screaming

219
00:14:26.992 --> 00:14:28.910
at the village kids in tongues.

220
00:14:28.994 --> 00:14:30.912
So...

221
00:14:30.996 --> 00:14:35.875
obviously. some of her behavior
isn't supposed to be innocent.

222
00:14:35.959 --> 00:14:39.170
Or that's exactly the point

223
00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:42.882
and Pearl is basically the white woman

224
00:14:42.966 --> 00:14:45.552
come to bring Hester down.

225
00:14:45.635 --> 00:14:49.764
Hester representing
all nonconforming women. of course.

226
00:14:49.848 --> 00:14:51.766
Brilliant. Cressida.

227
00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:53.727
Let's go into that some more.

228
00:14:54.811 --> 00:14:56.980
(jazz music playing)

229
00:14:57.063 --> 00:14:58.523
Here comes our host.

230
00:14:58.607 --> 00:14:59.774
-Hey.
-Hi.

231
00:14:59.858 --> 00:15:02.027
Welcome. welcome.

232
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:03.778
Hello. Wow.

233
00:15:03.862 --> 00:15:05.739
So. did it sink in yet?

234
00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:07.407
Ah. (sighs)

235
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:10.285
Well. I didn't sleep at all
the first night. if that counts.

236
00:15:10.368 --> 00:15:12.329
It's amazing. Gail.

237
00:15:12.412 --> 00:15:14.789
First Black master.

238
00:15:14.873 --> 00:15:16.958
You'll be president next.

239
00:15:17.042 --> 00:15:19.127
Should we call her Barack?

240
00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:20.837
Oh. (chuckles)

241
00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.423
Oh. no.
I meant of the school. but. you know...

242
00:15:23.506 --> 00:15:24.716
-I mean. not Barack.
-Of course.

243
00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:25.925
-It's a man's name.
-(Diandra laughing)

244
00:15:26.009 --> 00:15:27.927
No. yes. that's... that is true.

245
00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:29.846
It's all... it's very exciting.

246
00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:31.598
-It is.
-Yes. no. it is. it is.

247
00:15:31.681 --> 00:15:32.766
Well. you would know.

248
00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:34.643
I mean. you've held this position.

249
00:15:34.726 --> 00:15:36.728
But it's not quite the same.
It's...

250
00:15:38.188 --> 00:15:40.065
Welcome to the club.

251
00:15:40.148 --> 00:15:42.484
Thank you. Brian. (laughs)

252
00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:44.277
(sighs)

253
00:15:44.361 --> 00:15:46.363
(jazz music and chatter continues)

254
00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:51.034
Ugh. Shit.

255
00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:57.207
(sighs)

256
00:16:17.435 --> 00:16:19.270
Gail?

257
00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:24.609
Coming.

258
00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:29.656
-Mm. -Oh. my God.
-Yeah. yeah. yeah.

259
00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:31.741
-Witchcraft.
-I call pepperoni.

260
00:16:31.825 --> 00:16:33.243
-All of the pepperoni.
-I have...

261
00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:35.245
-I'm so hungry.
-Come on.

262
00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:37.122
-...paper napkins.
-Oh. my God.

263
00:16:37.205 --> 00:16:38.707
-Plates.
-Thank you so much.

264
00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:40.625
And it...

265
00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:43.586
came out to about 20 bucks.

266
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:45.922
Oh. I forgot how cheap it is up here.

267
00:16:46.005 --> 00:16:47.966
Stop avoiding the question.

268
00:16:48.049 --> 00:16:50.218
-I'm not avoiding the question.
-Are you two dating?

269
00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:52.137
Wait. are we talking about Tyler?

270
00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.139
As usual.

271
00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:56.015
Okay. we're not dating.

272
00:16:56.099 --> 00:16:58.643
We're just cool. you know?
'Cause. like. it's early.

273
00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:01.438
Dating's a lot. you know?

274
00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:06.234
It was actually like 19 bucks.
if you guys want to pay me back.

275
00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:08.111
Does 19 even divide four ways?

276
00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:10.196
I mean. if we're gonna do
that whole thing.

277
00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:13.199
that wine you're drinking is mine.
and that was $8.30

278
00:17:13.283 --> 00:17:14.993
if we're gonna pay individually. so...

279
00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:17.495
Get it right.
It's 8.3 recurring.

280
00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:18.788
It... Yeah.

281
00:17:18.872 --> 00:17:20.999
-I'm not even gonna...
-(laughter)

282
00:17:21.082 --> 00:17:23.084
(knocking)

283
00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:27.756
-Gail.
-Hey.

284
00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:30.133
-Oh. Hang on. Hang on.
-Sorry. I-I...

285
00:17:33.219 --> 00:17:34.763
(chuckling)

286
00:17:34.846 --> 00:17:36.431
Hi.

287
00:17:39.684 --> 00:17:41.144
Where were you?

288
00:17:41.227 --> 00:17:42.937
You look like you've seen a ghost.

289
00:17:43.021 --> 00:17:46.691
(groans) I just had
some of the other masters over.

290
00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:49.277
Damn. If this is
what you're like after a party...

291
00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.612
You're right.

292
00:17:50.695 --> 00:17:52.906
(sighs)
No. I'm overreacting.

293
00:17:52.989 --> 00:17:55.325
I just...
(inhales sharply)

294
00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:56.868
I just felt...

295
00:17:56.951 --> 00:17:58.536
Like a house nigger.

296
00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.413
No.

297
00:18:00.497 --> 00:18:01.831
That's...

298
00:18:01.915 --> 00:18:03.833
You think I don't know?

299
00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:07.462
Us sisters are an endangered species
on this campus.

300
00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:10.048
Let's get out of here. Boston.

301
00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:12.634
Let's get drunk. It'll be fun.

302
00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:13.718
-Come on.
-(sighs)

303
00:18:13.802 --> 00:18:15.678
I'm not going to Boston tonight.

304
00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.891
Don't worry.
Look. I'll see you soon.

305
00:18:28.233 --> 00:18:30.401
-(sighs)
-Hey.

306
00:18:30.485 --> 00:18:31.945
Be safe.

307
00:18:40.662 --> 00:18:42.205
I don't know.

308
00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:44.749
To me. it's faux woke.

309
00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:46.417
He always does that.

310
00:18:46.501 --> 00:18:50.088
His books always feel so sorry
for white men.

311
00:18:50.171 --> 00:18:52.090
Dude. how can you say that?

312
00:18:52.173 --> 00:18:54.217
Have you read Disgrace?

313
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.845
Now. I think you could
make a case for that.

314
00:18:56.928 --> 00:18:58.638
JOCK (laughing):
Oh. come on.

315
00:18:58.721 --> 00:19:00.473
But-but...

316
00:19:01.766 --> 00:19:03.810
...let's reach back to the Arendt reading.

317
00:19:03.893 --> 00:19:05.520
Thank you so much. Good work.

318
00:19:05.603 --> 00:19:08.106
The fact that you all were able
to put that together...

319
00:19:08.189 --> 00:19:09.774
Oh. Oh. we-we just...

320
00:19:09.858 --> 00:19:11.401
we thank you so much for coming.

321
00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:12.861
-Oh. yeah. no.
-We love you.

322
00:19:12.944 --> 00:19:15.488
You're our favorite teacher ever.

323
00:19:15.572 --> 00:19:17.407
Thank you. Sascha.
Such creative work. though.

324
00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:18.783
I'll see you on Tuesday.

325
00:19:32.422 --> 00:19:34.340
That's Margaret Millett?

326
00:19:34.424 --> 00:19:36.634
Clever girl.

327
00:19:36.718 --> 00:19:38.678
We're doing a whole series
on the witch trials

328
00:19:38.761 --> 00:19:41.014
ahead of the anniversary on December 3.

329
00:19:41.097 --> 00:19:45.101
They said that she died
at33 in the morning.

330
00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:47.061
According to the legend.

331
00:19:48.396 --> 00:19:50.273
Anyway. that's all a long time ago.

332
00:19:50.356 --> 00:19:52.859
Oh. no procrastinating here. I see.

333
00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:54.193
(chuckles)

334
00:19:54.277 --> 00:19:56.487
You've clearly got
a good head on your shoulders.

335
00:19:56.571 --> 00:20:00.783
Figuratively. maybe.
but dragging all these books around

336
00:20:00.867 --> 00:20:03.494
has completely wrecked my whole posture.

337
00:20:03.578 --> 00:20:05.914
And head. shoulder. neck alignment.

338
00:20:05.997 --> 00:20:07.957
(chuckling):
How funny.

339
00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:10.001
Your family must be so proud of you.

340
00:20:11.461 --> 00:20:13.004
Have a good one.

341
00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:18.593
-Hi.
-(alarm blares)

342
00:20:21.179 --> 00:20:23.181
That happened to me last time. too.

343
00:20:24.807 --> 00:20:26.476
(chuckles)

344
00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:28.227
-Could you come back?
-(alarm blares)

345
00:20:28.311 --> 00:20:29.729
And we'll just...

346
00:20:31.272 --> 00:20:32.649
(softly):
Yeah.

347
00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:34.525
We just need to be sure.

348
00:20:39.781 --> 00:20:41.991
I should take this as a sign.
(chuckles)

349
00:20:52.919 --> 00:20:54.629
Can I just...

350
00:21:06.516 --> 00:21:07.934
Sorry. (chuckles)

351
00:21:08.017 --> 00:21:09.936
-You know. just...
-No. No. no.

352
00:21:10.979 --> 00:21:11.980
(chuckles)

353
00:21:12.063 --> 00:21:13.564
Totally understand.

354
00:22:23.217 --> 00:22:24.552
Jasmine.

355
00:22:24.635 --> 00:22:27.472
Oh. my God. are you deaf?

356
00:22:27.555 --> 00:22:29.432
What are you doing?

357
00:22:29.515 --> 00:22:31.893
I asked you like ten times.

358
00:22:31.976 --> 00:22:34.312
Sorry. Sorry. I. um...

359
00:22:35.605 --> 00:22:38.316
I-I was having a bad dream.

360
00:22:38.399 --> 00:22:39.692
Was I saying anything?

361
00:22:39.776 --> 00:22:41.736
What?

362
00:22:41.819 --> 00:22:44.113
Oh. my God. I'm not doing this with you.

363
00:22:47.158 --> 00:22:48.618
(door closes)

364
00:23:10.932 --> 00:23:13.059
So. I read your essay.

365
00:23:13.142 --> 00:23:15.061
Uh. and it's good.

366
00:23:15.144 --> 00:23:17.021
-Thank God. I...
-Hang on.

367
00:23:17.105 --> 00:23:19.524
Didn't let me finish.
I can see your effort.

368
00:23:20.566 --> 00:23:22.401
It's just for
an entirely different prompt.

369
00:23:23.861 --> 00:23:26.405
You didn't address the topic at all.

370
00:23:26.489 --> 00:23:28.616
It's impossible.

371
00:23:28.699 --> 00:23:33.037
I-I mean. a critical race analysis
of The Scarlet Letter?

372
00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.414
What's the issue?

373
00:23:35.498 --> 00:23:36.999
It's-it's not there.

374
00:23:37.083 --> 00:23:39.043
There-there isn't race
in The Scarlet Letter.

375
00:23:39.127 --> 00:23:41.504
Oh. just because
you're not seeing something

376
00:23:41.587 --> 00:23:43.881
doesn't mean it isn't there.

377
00:23:43.965 --> 00:23:47.051
Whiteness doesn't have to be
the default. Jasmine.

378
00:23:50.346 --> 00:23:51.514
I get it.

379
00:23:51.597 --> 00:23:53.724
This is advanced stuff.

380
00:23:53.808 --> 00:23:56.102
It can be really hard
to make the adjustment

381
00:23:56.185 --> 00:23:57.812
to a school like this.

382
00:23:57.895 --> 00:23:59.522
especially for students of color
coming from...

383
00:23:59.605 --> 00:24:01.399
Wh-Where do you think I'm coming from?

384
00:24:02.441 --> 00:24:03.526
I didn't...

385
00:24:03.609 --> 00:24:05.319
I-I'm from the suburbs.

386
00:24:05.403 --> 00:24:06.737
Okay? Tacoma.

387
00:24:06.821 --> 00:24:08.698
I-I was valedictorian. class president.

388
00:24:08.781 --> 00:24:10.199
I'm not some...

389
00:24:11.993 --> 00:24:14.162
You-you don't even know who I am.

390
00:24:15.329 --> 00:24:16.706
You don't get it.

391
00:24:17.748 --> 00:24:19.667
You're wrong.

392
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:22.295
(door opens. closes)

393
00:24:23.337 --> 00:24:28.384
"By choosing its first Black master.
Ancaster is taking an exciting step..."

394
00:24:28.467 --> 00:24:29.802
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR (over phone):
Uh. you know what?

395
00:24:29.886 --> 00:24:32.388
I think "thrilling" would be
a better word.

396
00:24:32.471 --> 00:24:34.432
All right.

397
00:24:34.515 --> 00:24:39.312
"...thrilling step into today's
increasingly inclusive and diverse world.

398
00:24:39.395 --> 00:24:42.064
-As the woman chosen for this honor. I..."
-Oh.

399
00:24:42.148 --> 00:24:45.067
You know what?
"Woman of color" would be better.

400
00:24:46.068 --> 00:24:49.322
"...chosen for this honor.
I am humbled to be

401
00:24:49.405 --> 00:24:53.201
"a part of Ancaster's evolution.

402
00:24:53.284 --> 00:24:57.747
"Even so. there remains

403
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:59.999
a lot of work to pursue this goal."

404
00:25:00.082 --> 00:25:01.834
-Mm. good. That's good.
-(sighs)

405
00:25:01.918 --> 00:25:04.086
"And it will not be possible..."

406
00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:08.466
Uh. wait. wait. wait.

407
00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:10.968
-"And it won't be possible
without the help..." -Better.

408
00:25:11.052 --> 00:25:13.638
"...of donors like so many of yourselves."

409
00:25:14.889 --> 00:25:17.475
(gasping)

410
00:25:17.558 --> 00:25:18.809
Gail?

411
00:25:18.893 --> 00:25:21.771
-Gail. is everything okay?
-(sighs)

412
00:25:21.854 --> 00:25:23.272
Yeah.

413
00:25:23.356 --> 00:25:25.650
Yeah. I just. I scared myself.

414
00:25:25.733 --> 00:25:27.610
Okay. well. I'm gonna let you go.

415
00:25:27.693 --> 00:25:29.987
-Uh. we need you fresh for tomorrow.
-(vacuum whirring)

416
00:25:30.071 --> 00:25:31.489
Uh. listen. that donor meeting

417
00:25:31.572 --> 00:25:34.742
with the. uh. advisory committee
is in the morning.

418
00:25:34.825 --> 00:25:36.911
-so let's try and leave early.
-(sighs)

419
00:25:38.996 --> 00:25:41.040
Can I help you?

420
00:25:42.458 --> 00:25:44.502
I need to look something up.

421
00:25:44.585 --> 00:25:46.671
What happened in Belleville room 302?

422
00:25:55.888 --> 00:25:59.308
"Tragedy in Belleville room 302."

423
00:25:59.392 --> 00:26:01.602
"Louisa Weeks."

424
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:06.816
"Class of 1968."

425
00:26:06.899 --> 00:26:09.735
"Found hanging by her roommate.

426
00:26:11.612 --> 00:26:14.323
"The death of Ancaster's
first Black undergraduate

427
00:26:14.407 --> 00:26:16.867
brings an end to a promising young life."

428
00:26:33.175 --> 00:26:35.177
(shower water running)

429
00:26:39.557 --> 00:26:41.183
-(lights buzzing)
-(water stops)

430
00:26:42.476 --> 00:26:44.437
Can someone get the lights?

431
00:27:55.216 --> 00:27:57.009
You okay?

432
00:27:57.093 --> 00:27:59.011
-Liv's a bitch.
-Oh.

433
00:27:59.095 --> 00:28:00.971
Well. that killed my Sunday night.

434
00:28:01.055 --> 00:28:02.807
I spent the whole day on it.

435
00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:04.683
You started this
the day before it was due?

436
00:28:04.767 --> 00:28:06.727
I was at the Ache at the crack of dawn.

437
00:28:06.811 --> 00:28:08.187
I wanted to give myself time.

438
00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:11.190
All of that racial dynamic stuff--

439
00:28:11.273 --> 00:28:12.942
we don't have it back home.

440
00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:15.820
What'd you get?

441
00:28:15.903 --> 00:28:17.488
Uh. B-plus.

442
00:28:17.571 --> 00:28:18.989
How? What did you write about?

443
00:28:19.073 --> 00:28:21.075
I don't know. A bunch of stuff.

444
00:28:21.158 --> 00:28:24.453
The color red. Indians.
the French-Indian war.

445
00:28:24.537 --> 00:28:27.456
The savage as personified by nature.

446
00:28:28.624 --> 00:28:30.543
Are you telling me you had a hard time?

447
00:28:30.626 --> 00:28:32.294
Jasmine. it was easy.

448
00:28:33.963 --> 00:28:35.548
Dude. come on.

449
00:28:39.468 --> 00:28:41.512
This class is a complete joke.

450
00:28:41.595 --> 00:28:42.763
Liv's full of shit.

451
00:28:42.847 --> 00:28:45.307
It is uni. What'd you expect?

452
00:28:46.934 --> 00:28:48.936
(Gail chuckling)

453
00:28:57.027 --> 00:28:58.863
(Gail sighs)

454
00:29:01.198 --> 00:29:03.117
Well. your writing's great.

455
00:29:04.869 --> 00:29:06.745
I wish that made a difference.

456
00:29:09.665 --> 00:29:12.585
Maybe you can see if there's
an extra credit assignment?

457
00:29:20.342 --> 00:29:22.344
(paper rustling)

458
00:29:28.392 --> 00:29:30.227
What's this?

459
00:29:33.522 --> 00:29:35.357
I'm filing a dispute.

460
00:29:55.836 --> 00:29:57.505
(Gail mutters)

461
00:30:08.724 --> 00:30:11.060
(Gail sighs. clears throat)

462
00:30:13.604 --> 00:30:15.356
(Gail sighs)

463
00:30:17.942 --> 00:30:21.195
So that's really serious. Jasmine.

464
00:30:21.278 --> 00:30:24.406
I've never failed before in my life.

465
00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:26.200
Yeah.

466
00:30:27.368 --> 00:30:29.787
Don't take grades personally.

467
00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:33.165
Trust me. it'll save you a lot of grief.

468
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.336
It-it's not the grade. and it's not me.

469
00:30:38.671 --> 00:30:40.339
It's her.

470
00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:42.508
(lively chatter)

471
00:30:42.591 --> 00:30:44.134
I heard they tried
to poach him to Dartmouth.

472
00:30:44.218 --> 00:30:45.970
but then he'd have to move
to New Hampshire.

473
00:30:46.053 --> 00:30:47.763
and you know how he feels about snow.

474
00:30:47.846 --> 00:30:50.307
She's taking a sabbatical
to write a novel--

475
00:30:50.391 --> 00:30:51.433
a YA trilogy.

476
00:30:51.517 --> 00:30:52.851
It's completely shocking.

477
00:30:52.935 --> 00:30:54.728
-Heart attack...
-What?

478
00:30:54.812 --> 00:30:56.355
...in the middle of the lecture hall.

479
00:30:56.438 --> 00:30:58.399
-(laughter)
-You know. whatever. no judgment.

480
00:30:58.482 --> 00:31:01.026
I just. I didn't know that was his genre.

481
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:03.445
(chatter continues)

482
00:31:03.529 --> 00:31:05.155
Honestly. I think she's

483
00:31:05.239 --> 00:31:07.449
the perfect tenure candidate
for right now.

484
00:31:07.533 --> 00:31:09.118
What's now?

485
00:31:09.201 --> 00:31:12.788
She's incredibly popular with students.
several of whom wrote testimonials...

486
00:31:12.871 --> 00:31:14.206
15 of them.

487
00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:16.625
And let's be honest.

488
00:31:16.709 --> 00:31:18.502
Liv Beckman is a woman of color

489
00:31:18.586 --> 00:31:21.714
in a faculty overwhelmingly not...

490
00:31:22.756 --> 00:31:24.216
...of color.

491
00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:26.927
That is the image
that Ancaster should have.

492
00:31:27.011 --> 00:31:28.887
-not boring...
-Irrelevant.

493
00:31:28.971 --> 00:31:33.642
What we have to decide is.
on the basis of what is in here.

494
00:31:33.726 --> 00:31:36.604
does Professor Beckman
deserve to be tenured?

495
00:31:36.687 --> 00:31:38.856
It's a privilege.
It's not a right.

496
00:31:38.939 --> 00:31:40.357
You'd know something about privilege.

497
00:31:40.441 --> 00:31:43.527
Well. her published work is thin
to the point of nonexistence.

498
00:31:43.611 --> 00:31:45.112
Let's be fair.

499
00:31:45.195 --> 00:31:46.614
Liv has published.

500
00:31:46.697 --> 00:31:49.033
Maybe not a ton. but enough.

501
00:31:50.159 --> 00:31:54.413
Gail. do you really think
that you could be impartial?

502
00:31:55.456 --> 00:31:56.540
Why?

503
00:31:56.624 --> 00:31:57.875
Oh. she's your friend.

504
00:31:57.958 --> 00:31:59.460
Are you seriously trying

505
00:31:59.543 --> 00:32:00.919
to disenfranchise her right now?

506
00:32:01.003 --> 00:32:02.838
I am perfectly capable
of being professional.

507
00:32:02.921 --> 00:32:04.173
You're right.

508
00:32:04.256 --> 00:32:08.969
Actually. I'm surprised
that you don't agree.

509
00:32:09.053 --> 00:32:10.262
When you were tenured.

510
00:32:10.346 --> 00:32:13.182
you'd already had two books published
and how many articles?

511
00:32:13.265 --> 00:32:16.018
-Too many.
-Right. A ton.

512
00:32:17.061 --> 00:32:19.063
We have all been through the process.

513
00:32:19.146 --> 00:32:23.567
and we know how grueling it is.
but we earned it.

514
00:32:23.651 --> 00:32:28.197
We can look each other in the face
and know that we belong here.

515
00:32:29.365 --> 00:32:32.076
Imagine if that's brought into question.

516
00:32:36.538 --> 00:32:38.123
(sighs)

517
00:32:40.167 --> 00:32:42.294
I-I... you know. I-I do have...

518
00:32:42.378 --> 00:32:44.004
(sighs)

519
00:32:44.088 --> 00:32:45.673
...some doubts about Liv.

520
00:32:45.756 --> 00:32:50.636
A freshman in her seminar approached me
with a grade complaint.

521
00:32:50.719 --> 00:32:53.013
and she's filing a dispute
with the registrar.

522
00:32:53.097 --> 00:32:54.598
So...

523
00:32:54.682 --> 00:32:57.893
Grade grubbing is like an extracurricular
with these kids.

524
00:32:57.976 --> 00:32:59.144
Well. yeah. I know.

525
00:32:59.228 --> 00:33:00.938
but she thinks Liv is targeting her.

526
00:33:01.021 --> 00:33:04.650
so now OSL is doing
a performance review and...

527
00:33:04.733 --> 00:33:07.861
This... this is news to me.

528
00:33:07.945 --> 00:33:09.488
That definitely changes things.

529
00:33:09.571 --> 00:33:14.284
What I'm gonna suggest is
that we table this for today and reconvene

530
00:33:14.368 --> 00:33:17.037
when more of the details
come out in the wash.

531
00:33:17.121 --> 00:33:21.500
Now. African dance is in 15. so...
let's give 'em time to move the tables.

532
00:33:23.752 --> 00:33:25.421
Thanks for speaking up. Gail.

533
00:33:25.504 --> 00:33:28.799
We really needed your voice at the table.

534
00:33:28.882 --> 00:33:30.509
(Gail chuckles softly)

535
00:33:32.177 --> 00:33:35.139
(phone ringing)

536
00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:39.768
(receiver clicks)

537
00:33:39.852 --> 00:33:43.814
ESTHER (over phone):
Hello. Uh. this is Esther Bickert.

538
00:33:43.897 --> 00:33:47.192
I need to speak to you
about my daughter Elizabeth.

539
00:33:47.276 --> 00:33:49.403
Uh. who is this?

540
00:33:49.486 --> 00:33:52.531
You know my daughter from the college.

541
00:33:52.614 --> 00:33:55.743
(sighs) Call the registrar
if you are looking for a student.

542
00:33:55.826 --> 00:33:57.786
This is not the school.
It is a house.

543
00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:59.329
It is my home.

544
00:33:59.413 --> 00:34:02.791
-Please. this is important.
-(bell dings in distance)

545
00:34:02.875 --> 00:34:05.127
-I need to tell you about my daughter.
-(distant door slams)

546
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:07.296
(gasps)

547
00:34:07.379 --> 00:34:10.174
Hello? Hello?

548
00:34:25.439 --> 00:34:27.775
(papers rustling)

549
00:34:41.163 --> 00:34:42.790

551
00:35:28.544 --> 00:35:31.630
(screams. whimpers)

552
00:35:38.595 --> 00:35:41.181
It was total infestation.

553
00:35:41.265 --> 00:35:44.768
-Ugh.
-Looked like a plague.

554
00:35:44.852 --> 00:35:47.354
Luckily. (grunts) they said it would.

555
00:35:47.437 --> 00:35:50.858
you know. only take one day to fumigate.

556
00:35:50.941 --> 00:35:53.485
-Consider this a sleepover.
-(chuckles)

557
00:35:53.569 --> 00:35:55.696
I was always dying to have
friends over when I was a kid.

558
00:35:55.779 --> 00:35:57.489
Total only child.

559
00:35:57.573 --> 00:35:58.866
Me. too.

560
00:35:58.949 --> 00:36:01.326
Even my imaginary friend was shitty.

561
00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:02.786
(both chuckling)

562
00:36:04.705 --> 00:36:06.206
Hmm.

563
00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:07.833
I like your place.

564
00:36:07.916 --> 00:36:10.043
It's my third spot in three years.

565
00:36:11.253 --> 00:36:13.130
Trying to make this one a home.

566
00:36:14.172 --> 00:36:16.133
(sighs)

567
00:36:16.216 --> 00:36:18.218
I don't know what I'd do if you left.

568
00:36:19.261 --> 00:36:20.596
I don't. either.

569
00:36:21.638 --> 00:36:24.516

570
00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:26.602
(lively chatter and laughter)

571
00:36:30.063 --> 00:36:32.107
Hey.

572
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:33.400
Oh.

573
00:36:33.483 --> 00:36:35.527
My friends just went inside.

574
00:36:35.611 --> 00:36:37.571
Yeah. we're at capacity.

575
00:36:40.073 --> 00:36:42.200
Jasmine. what are you doing?

576
00:37:17.152 --> 00:37:18.654
Hey. look at Jasmine.

577
00:37:28.997 --> 00:37:30.707

No.

No. I-I'm just...

...really weird. I guess.

-I'm okay.

Hmm.

603
00:39:11.099 --> 00:39:13.769
But I was looking for a good chaser.

604
00:39:13.852 --> 00:39:15.020
A chaser?

605
00:39:15.103 --> 00:39:17.189
Are you serious?

No. no.

00:39:19.232 --> 00:39:20.650
No.

00:39:20.734 --> 00:39:23.236
Let me...

show you how to take a real shot.

610
00:39:27.199 --> 00:39:30.619

612
00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:36.416
Whatever that means.

613
00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:38.418
What you want to do is take a deep breath.

614
00:39:38.502 --> 00:39:40.837
(both inhale deeply)

615
00:39:40.921 --> 00:39:43.757

-(both exhale heavily)

616
00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.175
Take the shot.

Don't let me interrupt.

624
00:40:34.474 --> 00:40:35.934
I'll be right back.

Master Bishop. Hi.

629
00:41:25.275 --> 00:41:26.860
What's going on?

630
00:41:28.236 --> 00:41:30.030
-What?
-What?

631
00:41:30.113 --> 00:41:31.615
Who did this?

632
00:41:48.173 --> 00:41:49.466
Jasmine?

633
00:41:51.051 --> 00:41:53.178
-Did you hear anything?
-No.

634
00:41:54.596 --> 00:41:57.474
Hi. Is everything okay?

635
00:41:57.557 --> 00:41:59.517
Take a seat. Amelia.

636
00:42:00.644 --> 00:42:02.896
Did something happen?

637
00:42:02.979 --> 00:42:06.316
Someone carved the word "leave"
on your door and hung a noose.

638
00:42:06.399 --> 00:42:07.651
Why?

639
00:42:08.735 --> 00:42:11.696
Did you hear anything
when you got home last night?

640
00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:13.031
I actually. um...

641
00:42:13.114 --> 00:42:17.118
I didn't come back to the dorm last night.
so I haven't even seen anything.

642
00:42:17.202 --> 00:42:19.079
Is there anyone either of you

643
00:42:19.162 --> 00:42:21.414
-have a problem with?
-No.

644
00:42:21.498 --> 00:42:23.124
I mean. not me at least.

645
00:42:24.167 --> 00:42:25.210
No.

646
00:42:25.293 --> 00:42:27.504
It was probably just a prank.

647
00:42:27.587 --> 00:42:29.506
-You think this is a prank?
-No. no. I...

648
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:30.674
Sorry. I didn't mean like that.

649
00:42:30.757 --> 00:42:32.050
I just meant with the Witch

650
00:42:32.133 --> 00:42:35.011
and. like. that girl who died
in our room or whatever.

651
00:42:35.095 --> 00:42:38.181
I don't think
this is about the Witch. Amelia.

652
00:42:38.265 --> 00:42:40.684
Well. what do you think
it's about. Jasmine?

653
00:42:42.602 --> 00:42:44.145
I don't know.

654
00:42:46.856 --> 00:42:48.858
You girls get along fine. right?

655
00:42:48.942 --> 00:42:51.069
Yeah. we do.

656
00:42:54.114 --> 00:42:55.532
Yeah.

657
00:43:19.597 --> 00:43:21.099
I hate you.

658
00:43:26.938 --> 00:43:28.940

659

660
00:43:33.862 --> 00:43:36.031
I don't know. A noose?

661
00:43:36.114 --> 00:43:37.699
I've just never seen
anything like that before.

662
00:43:37.782 --> 00:43:39.576
Well. I have.

663
00:43:39.659 --> 00:43:41.578
At my grad school.
they found one on the quad.

664
00:43:41.661 --> 00:43:42.912
It was a huge scandal.

665
00:43:42.996 --> 00:43:44.247
My God.

666
00:43:44.331 --> 00:43:45.915
I'm just worried about Jasmine.

667
00:43:45.999 --> 00:43:48.918
Yeah. I mean. who knows
what she's going through?

668
00:43:49.002 --> 00:43:51.296
It kind of makes
that grade dispute make sense.

669
00:43:51.379 --> 00:43:55.050
Yeah. they fixate on grades
when everything else seems out of control.

670
00:43:55.133 --> 00:43:56.968
Yeah. but that dispute can control

671
00:43:57.052 --> 00:43:58.887
-whether or not I get tenure.
-(sighs)

672
00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:01.097
Liv. do not be dramatic. all right?

673
00:44:01.181 --> 00:44:02.682
You'll be f...

674
00:44:07.896 --> 00:44:09.272
Look.

675
00:44:10.607 --> 00:44:12.901
I've never seen them so close to town.

676
00:44:12.984 --> 00:44:15.528
Let's go. We shouldn't be here.

677
00:44:15.612 --> 00:44:17.364
Come on.

678
00:44:29.542 --> 00:44:31.961
This is one of
our oldest buildings on campus.

679
00:44:32.045 --> 00:44:33.755
-built in 1801.
-Ooh.

680
00:44:33.838 --> 00:44:35.256
And some of the original brickwork here

681
00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:37.008
was taken from
the Ancaster Village courthouse.

682
00:44:37.092 --> 00:44:39.386
where the infamous trials were held.

683
00:44:39.469 --> 00:44:41.429
If you'd like to follow me
right down this way.

684
00:44:41.513 --> 00:44:45.642
you can see what a standard housing option
looks like for Belleville House.

685
00:44:45.725 --> 00:44:48.103
Uh. we usually house
two students to a room.

686
00:44:48.186 --> 00:44:50.897
but we do have a single-student option
on a by-needs basis.

687
00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:56.986
Uh. just a reminder. there is never
a bad time to ask a question.

688
00:44:57.070 --> 00:45:01.825
You know. the cool thing about Ancaster is
the whole area is rich with history.

689
00:45:01.908 --> 00:45:04.285
-Oh.
-Oh. watch your step there. ma'am.

690
00:45:04.369 --> 00:45:06.371
The-the floor kind of buckles.

691
00:45:06.454 --> 00:45:10.333
And there's even a community descended
from the town's original settlers

692
00:45:10.417 --> 00:45:13.253
that still live and dress
like it's the 17th century.

693
00:45:14.462 --> 00:45:16.840
And. uh. right this way.

694
00:45:16.923 --> 00:45:18.842
When you're ready. just gather round.

695
00:45:18.925 --> 00:45:19.926
Find a spot.

696
00:45:22.137 --> 00:45:24.139
Okay. good.

697
00:45:24.222 --> 00:45:25.723
Here we are.

698
00:45:33.148 --> 00:45:36.443

699
00:45:50.373 --> 00:45:51.416
What's this?

700
00:45:52.792 --> 00:45:56.129
This is a Black student sleeping.

701
00:45:58.756 --> 00:45:59.757
What's that?

702
00:46:01.968 --> 00:46:03.511
That's what's coming.

703
00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:07.474
Wake up!

704
00:46:07.557 --> 00:46:09.767
No. wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

705
00:46:09.851 --> 00:46:11.686
No. wake up!

706
00:46:11.769 --> 00:46:14.439
(gasping. panting)

707
00:46:17.108 --> 00:46:19.235
No. I-I didn't...

708
00:46:19.319 --> 00:46:21.488
I didn't do... I just came over
to see if you were okay.

709
00:46:21.571 --> 00:46:23.990
I-I didn't do anything.
I-I swear. I just...

710
00:46:24.073 --> 00:46:26.576
You were talking in your sleep. and I-I...

711
00:46:26.659 --> 00:46:28.453
You just scared me. okay?

712
00:46:28.536 --> 00:46:30.538
(panting)

713
00:46:32.957 --> 00:46:35.043

714

in foreign language)

00:49:38.976 --> 00:49:41.562
(breath trembles)

720
00:49:41.646 --> 00:49:42.939
(gasps)

721
00:49:44.273 --> 00:49:46.025
-Come on!
-Wait! Hey!

722
00:49:46.109 --> 00:49:47.235
Come on!

723
00:49:47.318 --> 00:49:49.362
(whimpering)

724
00:49:52.031 --> 00:49:54.033
(sniffling)

725
00:50:01.582 --> 00:50:03.835
(sniffling)

726
00:50:06.295 --> 00:50:07.964
I'm sorry.

727
00:50:10.258 --> 00:50:11.968
Am I... Am I in trouble?

728
00:50:32.530 --> 00:50:33.698
(sighs)

729
00:50:35.908 --> 00:50:37.827
It's nearly freezing out.

730
00:50:41.998 --> 00:50:44.959
What were you doing
out there with those boys?

731
00:50:45.042 --> 00:50:47.044
Nothing.
We were just hanging out.

732
00:50:48.087 --> 00:50:49.505
They're friends.

733
00:50:52.341 --> 00:50:53.551
All right.

734
00:50:55.511 --> 00:50:59.015
(sighs)
So. uh. when you feel ready.

735
00:50:59.098 --> 00:51:01.350
I'll-I'll walk you over to the infirmary.

736
00:51:01.434 --> 00:51:02.935
I'm fine. No.

737
00:51:03.019 --> 00:51:05.438
Well. it's just. you've been drinking.

738
00:51:05.521 --> 00:51:07.273
No. I-I'm not gonna...

739
00:51:07.356 --> 00:51:09.859
Something might've happened
that you didn't realize.

740
00:51:09.942 --> 00:51:11.277
You know. frostbite even.

741
00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:12.737
I can't go.

742
00:51:15.782 --> 00:51:18.367
It's just gonna be hell
when everyone finds out.

743
00:51:22.163 --> 00:51:24.791
I know what happens.
and I'm not gonna do that again.

744
00:51:27.251 --> 00:51:28.920
I'll transfer. I'll leave. I-I'm just...

745
00:51:29.003 --> 00:51:30.713
I mean. I-I can't do that again.

746
00:51:30.797 --> 00:51:32.089
No. no. no. no.

747
00:51:32.173 --> 00:51:33.341
No.

748
00:51:34.383 --> 00:51:36.469
Let's just talk about this in the morning.

749
00:51:36.552 --> 00:51:38.930
Right now. I'll-I'll go...
I'll go to your room.

750
00:51:39.013 --> 00:51:40.848
I'll grab some clothes. and then...

751
00:51:40.932 --> 00:51:42.558
You won't get in.

752
00:51:42.642 --> 00:51:44.644
Jasmine locked it from the inside.

753
00:51:44.727 --> 00:51:46.020
She's a bitch.

754
00:51:47.021 --> 00:51:49.148
I hate that room.

755
00:51:49.232 --> 00:51:51.317
I hate it here.

756
00:52:10.586 --> 00:52:12.171
(copier whirring)

757
00:52:22.056 --> 00:52:24.058
(church bells chiming)

758
00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:35.903
Oh. sorry.

759
00:52:35.987 --> 00:52:37.488
Don't sweat it.

760
00:52:37.572 --> 00:52:39.240
I'm one step ahead of you.

761
00:52:40.491 --> 00:52:42.118
Fixatif.

762
00:52:42.201 --> 00:52:44.328
They wish it was that easy to shut me up.

763
00:52:44.412 --> 00:52:45.454
(Liv chuckles)

764
00:52:45.538 --> 00:52:46.622
Okay.

765
00:52:46.706 --> 00:52:48.916
Well. happy Thanksgiving.

766
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.669
Mm. So. when do you fly out?

767
00:52:51.752 --> 00:52:55.548
Uh. I'm actually staying for break.

768
00:52:55.631 --> 00:52:57.049
Word?

769
00:52:57.133 --> 00:52:58.634
That's too bad.

770
00:52:59.927 --> 00:53:01.470
Uh. are you going home?

771
00:53:01.554 --> 00:53:03.014
No. I...

772
00:53:03.097 --> 00:53:04.807
No. I'm going to New York.

773
00:53:04.891 --> 00:53:06.392
My friends are putting on a dinner.

774
00:53:06.475 --> 00:53:09.020
Collard greens. candied yams. the works.

775
00:53:10.104 --> 00:53:11.439
Listen.

776
00:53:11.522 --> 00:53:15.026
You don't have to feel like
anything is awkward between us.

777
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:16.569
At least on my part.

778
00:53:16.652 --> 00:53:18.237
Yeah.

779
00:53:18.321 --> 00:53:19.906
Yeah. same.

780
00:53:19.989 --> 00:53:21.657
Just know I'm here.

781
00:53:26.996 --> 00:53:28.706
What's happening?

782
00:53:28.789 --> 00:53:30.291
I'm leaving.

783
00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:32.877
For break?

784
00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:34.879
Forever.

785
00:53:58.152 --> 00:53:59.570
Honey?

786
00:54:00.613 --> 00:54:02.615
I know. Be there in a sec.

787
00:54:14.168 --> 00:54:16.003
Amelia. wait.

788
00:54:37.775 --> 00:54:39.694
Hey. Mom.

789
00:54:39.777 --> 00:54:41.570
Sorry I didn't reply sooner.

790
00:54:41.654 --> 00:54:46.117
I've just been so busy
with school. friends. everything.

791
00:54:48.244 --> 00:54:51.288
Things are still great with my roommate.

792
00:54:51.372 --> 00:54:53.541
She actually invited me home
for Thanksgiving with her.

793
00:54:53.624 --> 00:54:58.504
so don't worry. I won't be alone.

794
00:55:00.756 --> 00:55:02.299
(computer chimes)

795
00:55:57.980 --> 00:55:59.231
Hello?

796
00:55:59.315 --> 00:56:02.109
(alarm blaring)

797
00:56:09.909 --> 00:56:12.036
Anyone there?!

798
00:56:12.119 --> 00:56:14.121
(alarm continues)

799
00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:51.909
Oh. my God! Oh. God.

800
00:56:53.035 --> 00:56:55.037
Jasmine. get back!

801
00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:57.331
Jasmine. get back!

802
00:56:58.332 --> 00:57:00.126
Jasmine. get back!

803
00:57:00.209 --> 00:57:02.837
-I am Ancaster.
-(gentle piano music playing)

804
00:57:03.879 --> 00:57:06.132
I am Ancaster.

805
00:57:07.967 --> 00:57:10.553
I am Ancaster.

806
00:57:12.763 --> 00:57:14.849
I am Ancaster.

807
00:57:14.932 --> 00:57:19.520
The one thing that is not Ancaster
is discrimination.

808
00:57:19.603 --> 00:57:23.607
That's why I'm happy to announce
the college's latest initiative.

809
00:57:23.691 --> 00:57:26.610
The Ancaster Alliance
for an Inclusive Future

810
00:57:26.694 --> 00:57:29.905
is a student/faculty coalition
committed to protecting

811
00:57:29.989 --> 00:57:31.824
and promoting diversity.

812
00:57:32.992 --> 00:57:36.370
Using innovative methods
such as diversity workshops.

813
00:57:36.453 --> 00:57:39.290
a visiting lecture series
and multicultural events.

814
00:57:39.373 --> 00:57:43.586
AAIF will blaze a new path
towards radical inclusion.

815
00:57:44.628 --> 00:57:49.967
Now more than ever.
let's show the world who we really are.

816
00:57:50.050 --> 00:57:52.052
(indistinct radio chatter)

817
00:57:52.136 --> 00:57:54.138
(birds cawing)

818
00:57:57.057 --> 00:57:59.351
(vehicle doors opening. closing)

819
00:57:59.435 --> 00:58:00.769
(Gail sighs)

820
00:58:11.113 --> 00:58:12.740
(water running)

821
00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:20.372
(door opens)

822
00:58:34.136 --> 00:58:36.180
You're Jasmine. right?

823
00:58:36.263 --> 00:58:37.723
(water stops)

824
00:58:38.724 --> 00:58:41.143
Yeah. How did you know?

825
00:58:41.227 --> 00:58:43.270
How are you doing?

826
00:58:43.354 --> 00:58:45.022
Good.

827
00:58:45.105 --> 00:58:46.649
I'm great.

828
00:59:01.830 --> 00:59:03.582
It's been hard.

829
00:59:11.423 --> 00:59:14.385
My first semester. I had insomnia.

830
00:59:15.928 --> 00:59:19.056
During finals. I didn't sleep
for two days straight.

831
00:59:19.139 --> 00:59:20.641
I kind of hallucinated.

832
00:59:20.724 --> 00:59:22.726
I thought my lamp was a gnome.

833
00:59:29.692 --> 00:59:31.527
I've been having nightmares.

834
00:59:34.321 --> 00:59:35.698
A lot.

835
00:59:35.781 --> 00:59:37.283
(Sascha sighs softly)

836
00:59:41.161 --> 00:59:43.330
Come to the AfAm House sometime.

837
00:59:44.748 --> 00:59:47.293
It's a really great place
for students of color.

838
00:59:48.335 --> 00:59:50.796
All eight of us.

839
00:59:55.801 --> 00:59:57.553
Maybe I'll see you there.

840
01:00:05.769 --> 01:00:07.730
-(door opens)
-Did you fall in or something?

841
01:00:22.369 --> 01:00:23.996
You're not wrong.

842
01:00:27.666 --> 01:00:29.335
(scoffs) Okay.

843
01:00:29.418 --> 01:00:31.170
Nice vest.

844
01:00:31.253 --> 01:00:32.713
Do you know her?

845
01:00:34.089 --> 01:00:37.509
No. um. she... gave me this.

846
01:00:37.593 --> 01:00:39.762
(chuckles) Oh. my God.

847
01:00:39.845 --> 01:00:42.389
I had some people try to do this to me
but with Chabad.

848
01:00:42.473 --> 01:00:44.892
Ugh. Embarrassing.

849
01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:47.186
Actually. awful.

850
01:00:54.693 --> 01:00:57.488
Before we start. I-I have to say how much

851
01:00:57.571 --> 01:00:59.490
I enjoyed your editorial.

852
01:00:59.573 --> 01:01:00.991
The one in The Globe.

853
01:01:01.075 --> 01:01:03.327
Thank you. Thanks so much.

854
01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:06.038
Incredibly thought-provoking.

855
01:01:06.121 --> 01:01:09.792
So. this editorial. will it lead
to further publishing on your part?

856
01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:11.335
You know. books. I mean.

857
01:01:11.418 --> 01:01:12.836
Not in the immediate future.

858
01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:15.756
I'm in the early stages
of the notes collection process for...

859
01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:17.716
Well. published work. obviously it's just

860
01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:19.968
one factor in tenure review. so usually.

861
01:01:20.052 --> 01:01:23.597
in instances where
publishing is light. um.

862
01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:26.934
an application could lean
more heavily on other factors.

863
01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:30.938
such as classroom performance
and engagement.

864
01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:33.107
Understood completely.

865
01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:36.318
I place classroom instruction
above everything else.

866
01:01:36.402 --> 01:01:40.614
So you could understand
why the current dispute

867
01:01:40.697 --> 01:01:44.493
filed against you
is of particular concern.

868
01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:47.413
Well...

869
01:01:47.496 --> 01:01:48.997
Has that reached a resolution?

870
01:01:49.081 --> 01:01:50.416
Not yet.

871
01:01:52.918 --> 01:01:54.962
Uh. maybe you can...

872
01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:56.338
(sucks teeth)

873
01:01:56.422 --> 01:01:59.091
...expand a bit on
the-the substance of the issue.

874
01:02:00.467 --> 01:02:01.718
Uh...

875
01:02:02.803 --> 01:02:04.513
The issue...

876
01:02:09.143 --> 01:02:11.603
The issue...

877
01:02:11.687 --> 01:02:14.440
is this school.

878
01:02:15.816 --> 01:02:18.318
Why is this administration
spending more energy

879
01:02:18.402 --> 01:02:21.947
on undermining my application for tenure
than on ferreting out the racist

880
01:02:22.030 --> 01:02:23.574
who's been terrorizing the student body?

881
01:02:23.657 --> 01:02:25.492
I don't understand what the two have to...

882
01:02:25.576 --> 01:02:27.119
Last week. someone lit a cross on fire.

883
01:02:27.202 --> 01:02:29.496
This isn't an incident.
It's an emergency.

884
01:02:30.497 --> 01:02:32.666
I will not allow myself
to be scapegoated by a school

885
01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:36.336
that is unable or unwilling
to see itself for what it truly is.

886
01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:38.589
If anyone really wanted
to help that girl. it would be

887
01:02:38.672 --> 01:02:42.176
by ending the culture of hatred
that vandalizes students' rooms.

888
01:02:42.259 --> 01:02:44.678
undervalues the work
of professors of color

889
01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:47.139
and compels me to come
stand before all of you today.

890
01:02:50.601 --> 01:02:52.978
Look at what's happening to Jasmine Moore.

891
01:02:53.061 --> 01:02:56.440
Look at what's happening
right under your noses.

892
01:02:56.523 --> 01:02:58.525
(clock chiming)

893
01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:24.176
(bell dings)

894
01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:37.814
-(door creaking)
-(wind whistling)

895
01:03:49.117 --> 01:03:51.119
(woman sobbing)

896
01:04:18.105 --> 01:04:20.023
(gasping)

897
01:04:24.695 --> 01:04:26.613
-(bell dings)
-(gasps)

898
01:04:26.697 --> 01:04:28.699
(shuddering breaths)

899
01:04:33.328 --> 01:04:35.998
(bell dinging)

900
01:04:37.291 --> 01:04:38.500
(sighs)

901
01:04:38.584 --> 01:04:40.586
(phone ringing in distance)

902
01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:43.880
(footsteps)

903
01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:46.883
(phone ringing)

904
01:04:50.512 --> 01:04:52.514
(ringing continues)

905
01:05:06.945 --> 01:05:09.865
Last call. The library is now closed.

906
01:05:23.587 --> 01:05:25.422
(zips backpack)

907
01:05:30.844 --> 01:05:34.556
Hey. Katie. are you still here?

908
01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:37.059
Just got kicked out of the Ache.

909
01:05:37.142 --> 01:05:39.561
Thought maybe we could walk back together.

910
01:05:46.401 --> 01:05:48.695
(voices whispering)

911
01:05:59.998 --> 01:06:02.417
(voices whispering)

912
01:06:09.841 --> 01:06:11.134
(screams)

913
01:06:14.888 --> 01:06:16.515
Master Bishop.

914
01:06:21.395 --> 01:06:23.313
Master Bishop! Help!

915
01:06:23.397 --> 01:06:24.773
Please. Master Bishop!

916
01:06:24.856 --> 01:06:26.024
Please open the door!

917
01:06:26.108 --> 01:06:27.109
Help please!

918
01:06:27.192 --> 01:06:29.903
Master Bishop! Master Bishop!

919
01:06:29.986 --> 01:06:31.321
Please!

920
01:06:44.042 --> 01:06:47.546
(gasping. whimpering)

921
01:06:58.974 --> 01:07:00.308
(lock clicks)

922
01:07:00.392 --> 01:07:02.394
(panting)

923
01:07:07.733 --> 01:07:10.360
(breathing heavily)

924
01:07:15.657 --> 01:07:17.409
(whimpering)

925
01:07:18.869 --> 01:07:21.037
(door rattling)

926
01:07:21.121 --> 01:07:22.372
(grunts)

927
01:07:32.799 --> 01:07:34.134
(banging)

928
01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:51.401
(wind whistling softly)

929
01:07:56.406 --> 01:07:58.784
We got a live one.

930
01:08:11.421 --> 01:08:13.799
Welcome to Ancaster.

931
01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:19.221
(sighs softly)

932
01:08:24.267 --> 01:08:26.186
Jasmine.

933
01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:28.980
Oh. my God.

934
01:08:29.064 --> 01:08:30.440
(sighs)
Your mom's worried sick.

935
01:08:30.524 --> 01:08:33.068
She said you've barely called.

936
01:08:33.151 --> 01:08:35.320
Jasmine. how did this happen?

937
01:08:36.655 --> 01:08:38.657
Someone push you?

938
01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:41.827
Did you slip?

939
01:08:42.869 --> 01:08:44.830
I had to get away from her.

940
01:08:44.913 --> 01:08:46.623
Who?

941
01:08:46.706 --> 01:08:48.250
Get away from who?

942
01:08:48.333 --> 01:08:50.460
The Witch.

943
01:08:51.962 --> 01:08:53.505
The Witch isn't real.

944
01:08:53.588 --> 01:08:55.006
I'm not going back there.

945
01:08:56.049 --> 01:08:57.425
-Jasmine.
-I'm not going back.

946
01:08:57.509 --> 01:08:59.302
No. Jasmine.

947
01:08:59.386 --> 01:09:02.138
Jasmine. you can't quit.

948
01:09:03.181 --> 01:09:05.100
It's not ghosts.

949
01:09:05.183 --> 01:09:07.227
It's not supernatural. It's...

950
01:09:10.272 --> 01:09:12.607
It's America.

951
01:09:12.691 --> 01:09:15.151
And it's everywhere.

952
01:09:15.235 --> 01:09:16.695
I went through it.

953
01:09:16.778 --> 01:09:19.072
I went through it. and...

954
01:09:19.155 --> 01:09:21.283
I understand.

955
01:09:21.366 --> 01:09:23.869
I was one of three Black women.

956
01:09:23.952 --> 01:09:26.204
(voice breaking):
They couldn't even tell us apart.

957
01:09:27.789 --> 01:09:29.624
It was humiliating.

958
01:09:30.667 --> 01:09:36.006
But I stuck in there.
and I didn't let them push me out.

959
01:09:36.089 --> 01:09:38.300
I just need to get away from there.

960
01:09:40.927 --> 01:09:43.722
You can't get away from it. Jasmine.

961
01:09:45.015 --> 01:09:47.017
It'll follow you.

962
01:09:48.977 --> 01:09:51.438
Believe me.

963
01:09:51.521 --> 01:09:53.148
I know.

964
01:10:05.410 --> 01:10:07.412
(indistinct chatter)

965
01:10:40.445 --> 01:10:43.448
(woman sobbing)

966
01:10:49.913 --> 01:10:51.915
(sobbing continues)

967
01:11:03.218 --> 01:11:04.928
Help me.

968
01:11:07.347 --> 01:11:09.349
(sobbing continues)

969
01:11:22.654 --> 01:11:24.280
Virgie?

970
01:11:26.574 --> 01:11:28.410
We're too late.

971
01:11:30.412 --> 01:11:32.455
They're almost here.

972
01:11:34.582 --> 01:11:36.668
Let me get you someone.

973
01:11:38.378 --> 01:11:41.631
Get your Black hand off me!

974
01:11:41.715 --> 01:11:44.342
You think you can touch me?

975
01:11:44.426 --> 01:11:47.721
Oh. I let you get too comfortable.

976
01:11:49.764 --> 01:11:52.809
Gary warned me about this.

977
01:11:52.892 --> 01:11:55.020
You think you can touch me?

978
01:11:57.439 --> 01:11:59.441
How dare you?

979
01:12:01.985 --> 01:12:04.279
This is my house.

980
01:12:06.031 --> 01:12:08.783
This is my house.

981
01:12:10.869 --> 01:12:13.997
This is my house.

982
01:12:37.771 --> 01:12:39.773
(birds chirping)

983
01:12:47.906 --> 01:12:49.657
Jasmine?

984
01:12:52.118 --> 01:12:53.703
Does Gail know you're here?

985
01:12:53.787 --> 01:12:56.498
I came on my own.

986
01:12:57.582 --> 01:12:59.918
Wh-What are you trying to do?

987
01:13:00.001 --> 01:13:02.128
I figured it out.

988
01:13:02.212 --> 01:13:04.547
I understand now.

989
01:13:04.631 --> 01:13:07.884
I don't think this is the best place
for you to be right now.

990
01:13:07.967 --> 01:13:10.053
You're wrong.

991
01:13:10.136 --> 01:13:12.764
It doesn't matter where I go.

992
01:13:12.847 --> 01:13:14.682
It's everywhere.

993
01:13:20.605 --> 01:13:22.607
(church bells chiming)

994
01:13:29.989 --> 01:13:31.991
(students screaming out windows)

995
01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:47.132
Jasmine?

996
01:14:23.543 --> 01:14:25.461
(gasping)

997
01:14:25.545 --> 01:14:26.921
(screams)

998
01:14:27.005 --> 01:14:28.756
Jas... Jasmine!

999
01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:32.385
(sobbing):
Jasmine!

1000
01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:34.470
(wailing)

1001
01:14:36.931 --> 01:14:38.933
(wailing continues)

1002
01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:50.236
Jasmine!

1003
01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:52.238
Oh. God. no!

1004
01:15:14.219 --> 01:15:15.845
(sighs)

1005
01:15:36.491 --> 01:15:37.867
(sniffles)

1006
01:15:43.748 --> 01:15:46.000
(takes deep breath)

1007
01:16:05.186 --> 01:16:06.729
(door closes)

1008
01:16:24.497 --> 01:16:27.000
You look like you haven't been sleeping.

1009
01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:29.627
(sniffles. sighs)

1010
01:16:29.711 --> 01:16:31.421
How can I?

1011
01:16:31.504 --> 01:16:33.006
It wasn't your fault.

1012
01:16:33.089 --> 01:16:37.093
Mm. I mean. obviously. but...

1013
01:16:37.176 --> 01:16:39.512
don't blame yourself.

1014
01:16:43.224 --> 01:16:45.977
And I know this is hard for you. too.

1015
01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:50.440
You know. especially at a time
when we should be celebrating you.

1016
01:16:53.318 --> 01:16:55.278
You did it.

1017
01:16:56.571 --> 01:16:58.781
Tenure.

1018
01:16:58.865 --> 01:17:00.575
(chuckles softly)

1019
01:17:03.745 --> 01:17:06.539
I always thought this was the prize.

1020
01:17:09.083 --> 01:17:12.628
Sticking it out. surviving. enduring.

1021
01:17:12.712 --> 01:17:14.672
I...

1022
01:17:14.756 --> 01:17:17.800
What are we really doing it for?

1023
01:17:17.884 --> 01:17:20.303
I know what I'm doing this for.

1024
01:17:21.679 --> 01:17:23.931
I belong now.

1025
01:17:26.726 --> 01:17:28.853
I have a place.

1026
01:17:30.355 --> 01:17:34.275
And all the programs.
all the positions I applied to...

1027
01:17:34.359 --> 01:17:36.444
(chuckles softly)

1028
01:17:36.527 --> 01:17:39.489
...this was the only one
that took a chance on me.

1029
01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:45.119
Maybe belonging is
something you've always had.

1030
01:17:45.203 --> 01:17:46.788
Well. I didn't.

1031
01:17:46.871 --> 01:17:48.956
Nothing's ever come to me easy.

1032
01:17:50.208 --> 01:17:51.751
My own brother used to lock...

1033
01:17:51.834 --> 01:17:53.753
Your brother?

1034
01:17:53.836 --> 01:17:55.421
What?

1035
01:17:56.464 --> 01:17:58.674
You told me you were an only child.

1036
01:17:59.717 --> 01:18:03.846
I say I'm an orphan. too. sometimes.

1037
01:18:08.101 --> 01:18:10.228
They're not my family anymore.

1038
01:18:12.897 --> 01:18:15.441
That's why this matters to me. Gail.

1039
01:18:27.662 --> 01:18:29.664
(clock chiming)

1040
01:18:31.624 --> 01:18:33.626
(chiming continues)

1041
01:18:36.379 --> 01:18:38.381
(phone ringing)

1042
01:18:45.930 --> 01:18:48.683
ESTHER (over phone):
Don't hang up.

1043
01:18:48.766 --> 01:18:49.809
(Gail sniffles)

1044
01:18:49.892 --> 01:18:53.104
This is about my daughter Elizabeth.

1045
01:18:53.187 --> 01:18:55.940
but you might know her as Liv.

1046
01:19:03.322 --> 01:19:05.324
(quiet chatter)

1047
01:19:34.061 --> 01:19:36.439
I've been calling you for weeks.

1048
01:19:38.024 --> 01:19:40.109
You're Esther Bickert.

1049
01:19:44.113 --> 01:19:45.615
Here.

1050
01:19:57.877 --> 01:19:59.670
Is that Liv?

1051
01:19:59.754 --> 01:20:01.380
Elizabeth.

1052
01:20:01.464 --> 01:20:04.467
It's as if she walked
off the edge of the earth.

1053
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:07.553
Left and never came back.

1054
01:20:07.637 --> 01:20:10.556
In our community. that's not unusual.

1055
01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:12.391
It's unheard of.

1056
01:20:12.475 --> 01:20:16.896
And then one day.
there she was in a newspaper.

1057
01:20:16.979 --> 01:20:19.941
But they were calling her Liv.

1058
01:20:20.024 --> 01:20:22.693
And they were saying that she's Black.

1059
01:20:22.777 --> 01:20:24.570
Liv isn't Black?

1060
01:20:24.654 --> 01:20:26.197
Of course not.
She's my daughter.

1061
01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:28.282
But... her father?

1062
01:20:28.366 --> 01:20:30.785
No. God rest his soul. No.

1063
01:20:31.869 --> 01:20:37.124
No. I... No. I-I-I think
that this is between you and Liv.

1064
01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:41.254
(crying):
She won't speak to me.

1065
01:20:43.464 --> 01:20:45.758
The devil is inside her.

1066
01:20:46.759 --> 01:20:50.513
I just thought you should know the truth.

1067
01:20:55.017 --> 01:20:57.979
(sighs) This is a lot. I...

1068
01:20:58.062 --> 01:20:59.897
Why would...

1069
01:21:11.659 --> 01:21:13.244
(knocking)

1070
01:21:14.328 --> 01:21:15.788
-("Ride Like the Wind" playing)
-(lively chatter)

1071
01:21:15.871 --> 01:21:18.249
Oh. Gail. you made it.

1072
01:21:18.332 --> 01:21:19.542
Thank goodness.

1073
01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:22.128
This party could use a little more flavor.

1074
01:21:22.211 --> 01:21:23.796
(chuckles)

1075
01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:27.258
Big night for your friend.

1076
01:21:27.341 --> 01:21:29.427
(laughs) Tenure!

1077
01:21:37.059 --> 01:21:38.269
(laughing)

1078
01:21:38.352 --> 01:21:40.563
Oh. hi. Gail!

1079
01:21:40.646 --> 01:21:43.107
(raucous laughter)

1080
01:21:43.190 --> 01:21:45.192
(indistinct chatter echoing)

1081
01:22:18.476 --> 01:22:20.478
(voice muted)

1082
01:22:26.692 --> 01:22:28.611
That's one of my favorite songs.

1083
01:22:28.694 --> 01:22:30.446
-Gail.
-("Ride Like the Wind" continues)

1084
01:22:30.529 --> 01:22:31.947
Get over here and help me deejay.

1085
01:22:32.031 --> 01:22:33.949
But I'm doing an excellent job.

1086
01:22:34.033 --> 01:22:35.701
(Liv laughs)

1087
01:22:35.785 --> 01:22:38.788
I can't believe it.
This is a hostile takeover.

1088
01:22:38.871 --> 01:22:41.123
Brian. I love you.
but your music's not cutting it.

1089
01:22:41.207 --> 01:22:42.708
It's time for us to turn up.

1090
01:22:42.792 --> 01:22:44.502
Liv. do you... do you have a minute?

1091
01:22:44.585 --> 01:22:45.628
Wh-What do you mean. "turn up"?

1092
01:22:45.711 --> 01:22:47.213
Get turnt. Lit.

1093
01:22:47.296 --> 01:22:49.632
Gail. will you please
educate this man for me?

1094
01:22:49.715 --> 01:22:51.550
I-I need to talk to you.

1095
01:22:51.634 --> 01:22:52.802
-In a sec.
-(music stops)

1096
01:22:52.885 --> 01:22:54.720
Let me just show these white folk
what music is.

1097
01:22:58.265 --> 01:22:59.642
Whoa.

1098
01:22:59.725 --> 01:23:01.102
-(chuckling): Whoa.
-(Liv laughs)

1099
01:23:01.185 --> 01:23:03.020
All right. I'm-I'm out.
I'm out.

1100
01:23:03.104 --> 01:23:04.772
Uh. two left feet.

1101
01:23:04.855 --> 01:23:06.816
Gail. you can dance to this?

1102
01:23:06.899 --> 01:23:08.484
Of course she can.

1103
01:23:08.567 --> 01:23:10.486
-(Gail sighs)
-(Liv chuckling)

1104
01:23:10.569 --> 01:23:12.279
(song continues)

1105
01:23:12.363 --> 01:23:15.574
Stop it. Stop it.

1106
01:23:15.658 --> 01:23:17.201
(sighs)

1107
01:23:17.284 --> 01:23:19.370
Stop!

1108
01:23:21.288 --> 01:23:23.165
-(music stops)
-(pants)

1109
01:23:26.419 --> 01:23:28.295
You liar.

1110
01:23:28.379 --> 01:23:30.381
Gail. what the fuck?

1111
01:23:31.424 --> 01:23:33.592
I met your mom tonight.

1112
01:23:34.844 --> 01:23:36.512
How could you? You...

1113
01:23:36.595 --> 01:23:39.098
Liv. you're a fraud.

1114
01:23:40.558 --> 01:23:42.309
So. what are you saying?

1115
01:23:42.393 --> 01:23:47.106
I am saying that you have been
getting tutorials on Blackness

1116
01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:48.983
from a white woman.

1117
01:23:49.066 --> 01:23:52.903
Who you only gave tenure
because a Black girl died.

1118
01:23:52.987 --> 01:23:54.280
(others murmuring. groaning)

1119
01:23:54.363 --> 01:23:56.449
It's insane.

1120
01:23:56.532 --> 01:23:58.784
I don't have to prove
my Blackness to any of you.

1121
01:23:58.868 --> 01:24:00.327
No. you definitely do not.

1122
01:24:00.411 --> 01:24:02.204
And I am not comfortable. honestly. with

1123
01:24:02.288 --> 01:24:04.415
-the direction of this convers...
-Fuck you!

1124
01:24:06.167 --> 01:24:07.626
All right?

1125
01:24:07.710 --> 01:24:09.462
What are you comfortable with?

1126
01:24:09.545 --> 01:24:10.921
Wow.

1127
01:24:11.005 --> 01:24:12.298
Okay.

1128
01:24:12.381 --> 01:24:13.758
Oh. "Wow. Okay."

1129
01:24:13.841 --> 01:24:15.259
Exactly.

1130
01:24:15.342 --> 01:24:17.636
-You people are...
-"You people"?

1131
01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:21.557
...so divorced from reality
that you literally...

1132
01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:24.310
you can't tell Black from white.

1133
01:24:24.393 --> 01:24:26.562
That's what this place does.

1134
01:24:26.645 --> 01:24:28.898
That's what happened to Jasmine!

1135
01:24:28.981 --> 01:24:31.275
I know!

1136
01:24:31.358 --> 01:24:35.613
It might not be white hoods
and minstrels. but it's there.

1137
01:24:35.696 --> 01:24:37.156
It's like a ghost.

1138
01:24:37.239 --> 01:24:39.784
You just. you can't catch it!
You can't prove it!

1139
01:24:39.867 --> 01:24:41.660
Gail. calm down.

1140
01:24:41.744 --> 01:24:43.579
She died!

1141
01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:47.124
Do you hear that. Diandra?
She died.

1142
01:24:47.208 --> 01:24:49.210
And I could've helped her.

1143
01:24:53.088 --> 01:24:55.299
I could've set her free. but I...

1144
01:24:57.426 --> 01:24:59.428
I kept her here.

1145
01:25:05.976 --> 01:25:08.062
I was never a master.

1146
01:25:08.145 --> 01:25:09.814
(sobs)

1147
01:25:09.897 --> 01:25:11.649
I'm the maid.

1148
01:25:11.732 --> 01:25:15.110
You brought me here to clean up.

1149
01:25:18.155 --> 01:25:20.783
I didn't change anything.

1150
01:25:23.702 --> 01:25:25.746
I didn't do anything.

1151
01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:27.373
Just...

1152
01:25:29.625 --> 01:25:31.043
I failed her.

1153
01:25:33.963 --> 01:25:36.006
She's gonna haunt me.

1154
01:25:37.216 --> 01:25:40.302
She's gonna haunt me
for the rest of my life.

1155
01:25:43.472 --> 01:25:45.474
(laughter and chatter in distance)

1156
01:25:48.185 --> 01:25:50.187
(sobbing softly)

1157
01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:56.986
Gail. what happened?

1158
01:25:57.069 --> 01:26:01.115
I... I-I needed to talk to you.

1159
01:26:01.198 --> 01:26:04.743
You had to lose your shit
and drag my personal life through the mud

1160
01:26:04.827 --> 01:26:06.912
with all those white folks looking on?

1161
01:26:06.996 --> 01:26:08.122
You're white. too.

1162
01:26:08.205 --> 01:26:09.415
No. I'm not!

1163
01:26:09.498 --> 01:26:13.252
That woman raised me believing

1164
01:26:13.335 --> 01:26:15.379
that I would go to hell

1165
01:26:15.462 --> 01:26:18.549
for being the bastard child
of a Black man.

1166
01:26:18.632 --> 01:26:21.844
No! She-she said that your...
your father was white.

1167
01:26:24.221 --> 01:26:26.098
That's her story now. huh?

1168
01:26:26.181 --> 01:26:28.058
I worked too hard to be treated like this.

1169
01:26:28.142 --> 01:26:30.936
Not by her. not by you. not by Jasmine.

1170
01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:32.521
I told you the truth.

1171
01:26:34.356 --> 01:26:36.275
None of this makes sense.

1172
01:26:37.401 --> 01:26:38.777
I don't believe you.

1173
01:26:38.861 --> 01:26:40.779
It doesn't have to make sense to you.

1174
01:26:40.863 --> 01:26:42.781
You didn't live it.

1175
01:26:42.865 --> 01:26:45.242
It's not your story.

1176
01:26:45.326 --> 01:26:47.244
Consider yourself lucky.

1177
01:26:47.328 --> 01:26:49.330
(Gail crying softly)

1178
01:26:56.503 --> 01:26:58.297
The problem is

1179
01:26:58.380 --> 01:27:01.175
the administration has not been
prioritizing self-care.

1180
01:27:01.258 --> 01:27:03.510
I mean. it's complete...
it-it's completely toxic.

1181
01:27:03.594 --> 01:27:05.346
I completely agree.

1182
01:27:05.429 --> 01:27:08.140
And I-I... I really understand
how you feel. Gail.

1183
01:27:08.223 --> 01:27:10.100
because. you know.
at the end of the semester.

1184
01:27:10.184 --> 01:27:12.478
we're all worn out and exhausted.
all of us.

1185
01:27:12.561 --> 01:27:16.857
Oh. my gosh. I have a tension knot
the size of a golf ball.

1186
01:27:16.941 --> 01:27:21.779
Well. Gail. um. you know. it's been a...
a tough semester for all of us.

1187
01:27:21.862 --> 01:27:23.364
I didn't know what was going on.

1188
01:27:23.447 --> 01:27:25.491
I feel really bad about it.

1189
01:27:25.574 --> 01:27:27.034
It's just-- it's a lot of stress.

1190
01:27:27.117 --> 01:27:28.410
Not a good time.

1191
01:27:28.494 --> 01:27:30.245
There's no question about it.

1192
01:27:58.941 --> 01:28:00.693
(glass clinks on table)

1193
01:28:25.092 --> 01:28:27.386
Don't worry.
I'm not going anywhere.

1194
01:28:28.512 --> 01:28:30.055
Excuse me.

1195
01:28:30.139 --> 01:28:31.515
Thanks.

1196
01:28:39.481 --> 01:28:42.026
And it's never gonna change.

1197
01:28:48.490 --> 01:28:51.410
Well. all of this...
all of this tension at work

1198
01:28:51.493 --> 01:28:55.581
and all of this-- just everything going on
is just really just in my body. just...

1199
01:28:55.664 --> 01:28:57.416
I think with you it's emotional.

1200
01:29:05.424 --> 01:29:07.426
(radio static crackling quietly)

1201
01:29:11.346 --> 01:29:13.348
(indistinct radio chatter)

1202
01:29:16.143 --> 01:29:17.853
MAN (over radio):
Report of a suspicious female

1203
01:29:17.936 --> 01:29:19.772
on the freshman quad.

1204
01:29:19.855 --> 01:29:22.149
Please check it out and report back.

1205
01:29:24.359 --> 01:29:25.694
Faculty?

1206
01:29:25.778 --> 01:29:27.321
Mind if I look at your I.D.?

1207
01:29:27.404 --> 01:29:29.364
-No.
-Appreciate it.

1208
01:29:29.448 --> 01:29:30.449
I'll just give it a quick scan. then...

1209
01:29:30.532 --> 01:29:31.533
No. I mean...

1210
01:29:33.535 --> 01:29:35.454
...I don't work here.

1211
01:29:35.537 --> 01:29:37.289
I was just on my way out.

1212
01:29:37.372 --> 01:29:38.791
Oh.

1213
01:29:39.833 --> 01:29:41.668
Well. the exit's that way.

1214
01:29:46.256 --> 01:29:48.342
(sighs)

1215
01:29:54.681 --> 01:29:55.891
Master Bishop?

1216
01:29:58.685 --> 01:30:00.270
Master Bishop?

1217
01:30:00.354 --> 01:30:02.981
("I Shall Be Released"
by Nina Simone playing)

1218
01:31:24.104 --> 01:31:26.815
(song fades)

1219
01:38:14.222 --> 01:38:16.224
(music fades)
