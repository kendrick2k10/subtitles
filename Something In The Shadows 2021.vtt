hello my name is John farmer. i'm a paranormal
investigator and cryptozoologist. From a very

4
00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:33.610
early age i have experienced numerous encounters
of what people would consider to be paranormal

5
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.690
activity. In this space and time i have witnessed
more than the average person would have in

6
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.890
many lifetimes. I'm no spirit medium or clairvoyant
but i do possess a gift. a gift which allows

7
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:55.890
me to experience this activity. I've been
possessed 47 times in my life. i've been attacked

8
00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:06.350
by unknown forces. i've seen many unidentified
objects in the sky. all leading to this point.

9
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.310
It is now time for me to share my gift with
you the world. for the first time ever i will

10
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.990
attempt to capture this evidence in a six-part
series as we look into the unknown to prove

11
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:25.539
there is something in the shadows. What do
you think? huh? about that? Oh yeah it's good

107
00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.780
*Group mumblings*

108
00:10:11.549 --> 00:10:15.841
Okay you ready?
Well. is it alright with that in the background?

109
00:10:16.033 --> 00:10:23.633
yeah yeah. Kirk! There's ducks. Yeah you're
in shot though mate. Have you seen the ducks?

110
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:30.440
Yes. yeah. Okay.. Good evening you join me
as i stand at the mouth of this huge body

111
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:38.749
of water. Extending 23 miles its deepest point
is said to be around 800 feet. It is home

112
00:10:38.749 --> 00:10:45.249
to many species of wildlife and huge forests.
and if hundreds of reports are to be believed.

113
00:10:45.249 --> 00:10:50.970
a monster. A monster that's been seen by so
many people that it is famous throughout the

114
00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:57.170
world. Welcome to loch ness. hey come right
up to ya

115
00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:01.569
ducks come straight up to ya. look

116
00:11:01.569 --> 00:11:07.520
it is thought that the monster that dwells
within the lock is a survivor from the jurassic

117
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:12.850
period or simply a creature that just hasn't
been discovered yet. one thing is for certain

118
00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:18.089
there is plenty of room for it to hide. There
is one other theory which may hold the key

119
00:11:18.089 --> 00:11:24.470
to this and many other mysteries throughout
the world.

120
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:32.620
Portals. These portals or gateways are said
to be entrances into other dimensions where

121
00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:41.749
creatures can manifest at will. Beings such
as bigfoot. werewolves. aliens. shadowmen

122
00:11:41.749 --> 00:11:46.879
and even ghosts are said to travel through
these portals.

123
00:12:01.911 --> 00:12:07.601
One such portal is said to exist right here
at loch ness. not only the infamous nessie.

124
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:15.809
but many other strange phenomena have been
witnessed in this area. Ufo sightings. strange

125
00:12:15.809 --> 00:12:22.120
cryptids that roam the vast forests and many
many ghost sightings. On this week's episode

126
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:26.709
of there's something in the shadows. we'll
be spending three nights deep within the forest

127
00:12:26.709 --> 00:12:28.189
and within the portal.

128
00:12:28.189 --> 00:12:37.559
Was that alright? Yeah sounds good yeah. So
is this episode not about the monster? It's

129
00:12:37.559 --> 00:12:42.653
about the area really. the portal. I mean
how many people have come here looking for

130
00:12:42.653 --> 00:12:48.439
the monster? Loads. We could waste a bit of
time as well. Yeah. Yeah instead of getting

131
00:12:48.439 --> 00:12:55.059
food. We'd just be just be filming the water
for a week. Well . sorry captain kirk's orders.

132
00:12:55.059 --> 00:12:59.158
If you see me pulling my face at you by the
way it's not that i'm judging your performance.

133
00:12:59.158 --> 00:13:03.387
i'm disagreeing with all the bullshit You're
saying. You don't believe me man. you gotta be a believer

134
00:13:07.465 --> 00:13:09.465
*wind howling*

135
00:13:25.589 --> 00:13:27.998

Watch out for the wild boars.Bumped into some
local gentleman who told us to watch out for

144
00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:57.425
the wild boars so he knows the territory better
than we do so. There better be more than wild

145
00:14:57.425 --> 00:14:58.425
boars mate

146
00:15:00.179 --> 00:15:06.079
maybe the spirits of wild boars. Yeah well
you never know. What do you reckon Daz? Oh

148
00:15:08.394 --> 00:15:09.280

there's any electromagnetic fields. Okay so

160
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:40.989

meter well as you can see there's nothing

161
00:16:40.989 --> 00:16:48.050
going on right now but I do hope. You know ghosts
come to this realm using electromagnetic fields

162
00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:55.309
so uh as you know. yeah so yeah i mean no
reading yet but there's no electricity about

163

168
00:17:23.125 --> 00:17:27.109

169
00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:35.310
So. after several hours trekking through the
very remote forest. we've decided to set up

170
00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:41.050
camp here. right in the heart of where the
paranormal portal is located. We're going

171
00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:45.509
to do a bit of a base check with the emf meter
and then we're going to settle down for the

172
00:17:45.509 --> 00:17:48.320
night.
Cool

173
00:17:53.002 --> 00:17:55.613
Say hello Steve.
Take your mask off mate

174
00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:09.440
Tell us why we've got the masks on Steve. The bloody
midges mate. eaten alive by midges.

175
00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:14.833
Can you see the one in the middle of my head
still? It's gone down a bit. Has it gone down?

176
00:18:14.833 --> 00:18:20.640
it's gone down . You look like a unicorn.
Looks like someones hit you in the head with

177
00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.378
a penis.

178
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:28.385
Did you say he'll grow a third penis?
No. like someone had hit him on the head with one

179
00:18:30.366 --> 00:18:32.366
And that's why we're wearing masks.

180
00:18:36.089 --> 00:18:40.130
Ready? Oh you're already filming?
I'll go again then

Ah man it's raining

183
00:18:48.902 --> 00:18:53.118
That's because you're meditating. Well i'm
trying to. His chins itching.

184
00:18:56.551 --> 00:18:58.551
His chins itching

185
00:19:10.519 --> 00:19:14.580
. You don't look like your meditating. your
getting rained on and your eyes are open.

186
00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:18.415
Looks like your having a poo mate.
like your warming up to drop one out

187
00:19:20.368 --> 00:19:21.760
Mate. I got some wet wipes

188
00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.087
Until you've tried it mate don't knock it.

189
00:19:25.087 --> 00:19:30.164
me that. I'll do it in my tent next time.
It's crap. Is that supposed to be sticking

190
00:19:30.164 --> 00:19:35.804
out like that? No i'm just about to sort it.

191
00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:37.220
his life.

192
00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:48.380

was really good. How's it going Stevo? I believe

195
00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:05.320
children are the future. Do you think so.
how come? Teach them well and let them lead

196
00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:10.490
the way. That is words of wisdom sir. words
of wisdom. I learned that on the way.

197
00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:16.464
What's this. is this a backing shot or is
it a tracking shot what's it called? A back

198
00:20:16.464 --> 00:20:17.440
shot? I don't know.

199
00:20:18.032 --> 00:20:19.159

you say support old farmer and his uh portal

222
00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:10.290

223
00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:14.821
you believe in the existence of a paranormal
portal? Do i believe in existence for paranormal

224
00:22:14.821 --> 00:22:16.760
portal? mate!

225
00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:24.370
Do i believe in the existence of a paranormal
portal?

226
00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:30.410
Yeah I do. thanks mate. yeah it's got a thumbs
up from there. For the record i'm not saying

227
00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:34.630
i don't believe . i'm not saying i don't believe.
Look. i know it is far-fetched right you know

228
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:40.370
what i mean but. i've never seen one but i
know that the spirally whirly things exist.

229
00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:45.980
And what about the monster? What a scientific
explanation.

230
00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:53.780
That's the best i'd come up with. Do you believe
in the existence? Do i exist in it?do you

231
00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:58.374
believe in the existence? Do I believe in
the loch ness monster? What am I supposed

232
00:22:58.374 --> 00:23:02.255
to say? No i don't even know. i don't I think..
it's a hard question. am i supposed to believe

233
00:23:02.255 --> 00:23:07.125
in it? Just say yes or no. Yeah okay does
it matter? does it matter? Okay uh I'm not.

234
00:23:08.304 --> 00:23:13.604
I'm not. i'm not sure about the loch ness
to be honest um you know what I mean? It's

235
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:20.110
not really.. not well. because there's no
bones is there? there's no like they get dinosaur

236
00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:25.753
bones and then you know there's never a loch
ness bone found. Oh yeah well they live in

237
00:23:25.753 --> 00:23:32.065
the loch. But it's a lake. that's not the
sea is it? You don't walk around and find

238
00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.420
whale bones in the forest.

239
00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:43.780
They live in the sea. Oh in that case then
yeah. Steve! Alright Fred? Talk to me. What

240
00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:49.610
do you want me to say? what do you want me
to do? Well we're talking about the paranormal

241
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:54.920
paranormal portals what john's looking for.
do you believe in the existence of them? Well.

242
00:23:54.920 --> 00:24:04.530
i follow John to do what he wants to do. open
to either way happening. yeah it's one of

243
00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:09.630
them in it? So you're on the fence with this
one yeah? Oh massively yeah i mean probably

244
00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:15.840
more to not believing but you know i'll go
with me mate. he's got strong views on this

245
00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:18.763
so uh i'm here to support him.

246
00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:29.570
John farmer! Yes? How are you doing? All right.
So do I need to ask if you believe in the

247
00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:33.350
existence of the paranormal portal? You know
I do.Look. you've got to keep an open mind.

248
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:35.179
Cool. Could be.

249
00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:41.780
You've got to believe. and I believe. I do.

250
00:24:44.639 --> 00:24:46.575
Why are you laughing?

251
00:24:46.576 --> 00:24:47.273
I believe I can

252
00:24:47.273 --> 00:24:51.871
fly. No you can't sing that. he's a nonce.

253
00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.152
What are you doing John?
I'm trying to get

254
00:24:57.152 --> 00:25:03.398
all the stuff off it . No you don't need to
ya numpty. Listen. I'm not being funny..Kirk!

255
00:25:04.601 --> 00:25:05.101
Kirk!

256
00:25:06.628 --> 00:25:17.921
i think you should get the emf up here mate.
Okay why? It's gone up three. Right. See.

257
00:25:17.921 --> 00:25:23.561
Okay. What did I say? [ __ ] hell. all right
then mate yep you win. I like aliens. will

258
00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:32.000
be my favorite um horror but sci-fi horror
isn't it? I'd say it was a horror and a sci-fi.

259
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.057
So is that classed as a horror then? Yeah.
like event horizon would be classed as a horror

260
00:25:38.057 --> 00:25:40.000
and a sci-fi

261
00:25:45.299 --> 00:25:52.034
I was absolutely petrified of the exorcist
as a child. As a child? Again i watched it way

262
00:25:52.034 --> 00:25:57.844
too young. my dad would just used to let us
get on with it. Freddy krueger. I watched

263
00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:03.611
Nightmare on elm street when I was six .yeah
i loved it. i stayed up and watched it. I

264
00:26:03.611 --> 00:26:07.900
used to watch American werewolf in London.

265
00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:13.210
I would watch that every week. yeah it was
mental. i love that. I couldn't watch where

266
00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:18.680
he transformed. it used to freak me out bad
but i was about what was i about 12 13 something

267
00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:23.554
like that so it was mental at that age to
watch that and he used to watch that. The

268
00:26:23.554 --> 00:26:26.400
slaughtered lamb. I've never missed that board.

269
00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.731
There's that bat again look.

270
00:26:30.731 --> 00:26:32.480
Where?

271
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:43.559
No that's behind the tent again

272
00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:49.200
When you're shining the lights through your
eyes you're adjusting to it. you start seeing

273
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:55.315
stuff don't you? the shadows and things. Oh
yeah. That might be real. There it is again.

274
00:26:55.315 --> 00:27:01.918
What? the bat there look. I think you're messing
the bat up.The bat's like "I don't know where

275
00:27:01.918 --> 00:27:08.459
to go". It's got like. bat blindness. It saying
"I just want to [ __ ] sit down. it's like..

276
00:27:08.459 --> 00:27:09.459
it's gone

277
00:27:10.637 --> 00:27:18.638
Look you have to keep an open mind. anything
can be a sign. Yeah okay. Wow. there's three

278
00:27:18.638 --> 00:27:20.000
bats.

279
00:27:22.466 --> 00:27:24.466
We're in the right place you know.

280
00:27:25.777 --> 00:27:27.520
We are in the right place

281
00:27:33.939 --> 00:27:38.442
oh he's playing hide and seek. but not very
well because he keeps shining the torch on

282
00:27:38.442 --> 00:27:39.466
Why are they rotating around us then?

283
00:27:39.466 --> 00:27:42.625
I was going to say. are they rotating
around this area because it's the center of

284
00:27:42.625 --> 00:27:46.354
the portal? Or maybe they want to suck our
[ __ ] blood

285
00:27:46.354 --> 00:27:47.045
*laughs*

286
00:27:47.935 --> 00:27:53.611
The running mans another good film. What's
with them candles? I was going to put them around the camp

287
00:27:53.611 --> 00:27:55.585
somewhere but I can't be arsed to get up.

288
00:27:59.447 --> 00:28:03.746
*General inaudible chatter*

289
00:28:08.986 --> 00:28:12.040
Ive seen candles work.
If only we had a massive

290
00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:20.640
flame in the middle of the camp. So what in
your opinion. what will be the proof of a

291
00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:27.200
portal? We need to see. we need to see something
happen or we need to see.. So okay let's say

292
00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:32.000
if we saw a ufo would in your opinion would
that would that be just a ufo sighting or

293
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:39.450
would that be the existence of a portal? I
know what you say.. The portal exists. I can

294
00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:46.060
understand like different areas like say Wiltshire
in england it'd be like hot spots you could

295
00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:51.310
say yeah well that's because it's salisbury
and there's supposed to be a a portal or whatever

296
00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:56.200
there so yeah i can get that. but there's got
to be.. you can't just say um i've just heard

297
00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:00.050
a branch snap. it's definitely a portal. Yeah.
There's got to be something you know what

298
00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:05.820
I mean? Okay a ufo would be exciting but i
don't think that defines it okay for us i

299
00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:14.760
need to see. we want to see something. Paranormal
activity or a creature. Yes i know nothing

300
00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:21.500
about it. tell me about it. Okay so so okay
so there's the things that i've seen but what

301
00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:26.460
about the other hundreds and thousands of
people that have seen the same thing and how

302
00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:31.262
are they all linked how do they all end up
looking like the same the same thing or they've

303
00:29:31.262 --> 00:29:38.360
all heard the same noise or they've all heard
you know. (Steves Ringtone) Explain that.

304
00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:41.760
someone in south america and then someone
say. here.

305
00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:50.221
well i don't know you have to kind of have
to yeah you have to i don't have to research

306
00:29:50.221 --> 00:29:55.467
that. Exactly. But yeah yeah yeah. Fair play
i mean you know prove that it doesn't exist.

307
00:29:55.467 --> 00:30:02.360
Yeah yeah. I can't you know. But do you actually
see a portal or do you just see what come

308
00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:07.400
out? We're in the portal. i don't know where
the the gateway. the actual entrance in or

309
00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:12.060
out is but we are in it that's why the meter
readings are so high here.

310
00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:21.870
The meter readings are high in my house but
i've never seen nothing come out. Well it's

311
00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:30.519
not the same thing is it? At what point do
these things come out? a monster for example.It's

312
00:30:30.519 --> 00:30:35.340
not like monster inc where they just go through
a door and come out it's like they manifest

313
00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:41.280
that they appear through the portal. Yeah.
So they could just come out from over

314
00:30:44.762 --> 00:30:46.762
*sound of rain falling on the tent*

315
00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:52.967
Kirk!

316
00:30:58.982 --> 00:30:59.758
Kirk

317
00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.760
Kirk wake up

318
00:31:05.274 --> 00:31:06.445
Kirk!

319
00:31:08.429 --> 00:31:09.322

Did you hear that?

323
00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:28.793
You ever heard of a branch falling from a tree?

324
00:31:29.361 --> 00:31:33.807
it was thrown oh just listen

325
00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:54.845
Mate your freaking me out

Go asleep. don't worry about it

327
00:32:01.074 --> 00:32:02.201
*sound of the river*

328
00:32:03.803 --> 00:32:05.934
*fire sound with background conversation*

329
00:32:10.318 --> 00:32:11.799
I need a sleep

330
00:32:11.799 --> 00:32:17.600
All I heard was you snoring.
That wasn't me. It was you. Morning everybody.

331
00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:29.083
Morning! Mr Farmer! Morning mate. Did you
hear them noises last night? What the branches

332
00:32:29.083 --> 00:32:36.144
falling off the tree? I heard somebody snoring
at some point. That was you. I can't hear

333
00:32:36.144 --> 00:32:40.555
myself snore. Come on. you heard it.

334
00:32:40.555 --> 00:32:47.194
I told ya. it was branches falling off the
tress. What noises? what noises? I didn't

335
00:32:47.194 --> 00:32:53.944
hear any noises. Well it's like a stone. something
being thrown to the camp. I mean. it could

336
00:32:55.806 --> 00:32:56.640
Yeah

337
00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:57.636
He means the stuff on the floor

338
00:32:57.636 --> 00:32:58.940
What are they called?

339
00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:00.640
Pine cones.

340
00:33:01.513 --> 00:33:08.343
Okay go. So first night here in the forest
of loch ness and it was pretty eventful.

341
00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:09.303
*background voices*
We love you Jon farmer

342
00:33:09.303 --> 00:33:11.001
Shut up.

343
00:33:12.529 --> 00:33:16.013
Can we do it again? Yeah. quiet we're going
to do this take now.

344
00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:25.922
Right so first night here in the forest of
loch ness and it was pretty eventful. Everyone

345
00:33:25.966 --> 00:33:31.150
heard stones being thrown into the camp by
an unseen force. Unfortunately we were unable

346
00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:39.617
to capture this on camera but let's see what
happens later. overall a promising start

347
00:33:43.549 --> 00:33:46.549
Lovely. Sorted?

348
00:33:55.100 --> 00:34:06.641
It's having a poo. did you see?That's rude.
right in the middle of camp. I'm having a

349
00:34:06.641 --> 00:34:08.000
dump here pal.

350
00:34:12.237 --> 00:34:16.534
Maybe the robin has been used as a vessel
to communicate. Come on

351
00:34:17.036 --> 00:34:19.036
Come on! a robin?

352
00:34:22.949 --> 00:34:30.000
Let's see what Daz is up to? what kind of
scientific paranormal investigation Daz is

353
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:38.469
conjuring up in his tent. Seems like he's
deep in meditation there. don't want to disturb

354
00:34:38.469 --> 00:34:44.409
it. we don't disturb it. I am though. Yeah
well. I'm only an I.T technician i've been

355
00:34:44.409 --> 00:34:50.580
dragged into this and look. i'm not good at
this stuff. i'm not that you know what i'm

356
00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:58.250
doing but i know that is going up to that.
that's crazy. Yeah. Even for this you know

357
00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:02.690
make sure you cut it so i look like a paranormal
detective. Yeah obviously . i've got to make

358
00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:07.540
this look like a cameraman. i just looked
at the camera and i'm filming up the tree.

359
00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:12.319
Yeah yeah yeah. John Farmer. how's it going?
How's it going? Alright. You getting anything?

360
00:35:16.422 --> 00:35:25.357
I'm sensing a strange static in the air. Okay.
what. what's that then? Can't you feel it?

361
00:35:26.972 --> 00:35:35.557
No. It's like um. it's like when you rub a
balloon on yourself and it you when you bring

362
00:35:35.557 --> 00:35:39.730
it near you can feel like the static coming
off it and i can i'm feeling that everywhere.

363
00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:43.964
and i'm also sensing a spirit. Look this way
John so I can hear you better.

364
00:35:44.609 --> 00:35:45.780
Yeah go on.

365
00:35:47.369 --> 00:35:57.970
I'm also sensing a spirit now whether that's
animal or human i don't know. Well. what's

366
00:35:57.970 --> 00:36:02.960
the difference? Well one's animal and one's
human

367
00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:10.000
Shall i do call out to spirit? Yeah go for
it.

368
00:36:18.235 --> 00:36:21.325
Are there any spirits present?

369
00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:26.109
Anyone wishing to make contact?

370
00:36:28.248 --> 00:36:30.322
We mean no harm?

371
00:36:34.905 --> 00:36:44.000
We're here to make contact. we want proof.
Okay so say that again. We said we've just

372
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.970
heard you're making a noise what are you doing?
We didn't make it seriously. maybe we didn't

373
00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:54.200
make any noises. Oh okay then there's monkeys
in the forest guys. oh-oh. they didn't tell

374
00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.080
us about it.

375
00:36:56.801 --> 00:36:58.801
*wooping noises*

376
00:36:58.801 --> 00:37:04.535
All right. maybe it wasn't you. What what
the [ __ ] was that? Someone messing about.

377
00:37:04.914 --> 00:37:06.400
*Steve mimics noise*

378
00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.425
Hang on. what?

379
00:37:09.664 --> 00:37:11.664
*wooping noise again*

380
00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.640
I told ya

381
00:37:15.405 --> 00:37:16.755
That bloke told us about wild
boars. You still filming this?

382
00:37:16.755 --> 00:37:18.287
Yeah. still filming?
Everyone shhh

383
00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:26.980
So everyone in the camp has just heard a strange
whooping noise coming from the forest. We

384
00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:32.160
did a call out to spirit earlier so i'm guessing
this is a direct response to that. one other

385
00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:37.660
option is sasquatch or bigfoot as it's generally
known they've been known to make these strange

386
00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:42.461
kinds of whooping sounds. it's definitely
something we can look into

387
00:37:43.988 --> 00:37:50.910
Bigfoot? Yeah. what else can it be? Well.
people John. Who's gonna come all the way

388
00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:57.430
out here and make noises like that? Again.
you know. people. i mean whatever it is it's

389
00:37:57.430 --> 00:38:04.052
not bigfoot is it? come on. All right maybe
it is people but you've got to keep an open

390
00:38:04.052 --> 00:38:09.972
mind Fred. I know that but. i mean i can accept
ghosts probably exist. i know ufo's are real

391
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:17.540
because i've seen one. yeah the Loch Ness
monster maybe but bigfoot? come on. Gorillas

392
00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:19.630
weren't discovered until 1902.

393
00:38:23.558 --> 00:38:31.360
I know. but john . people who see bigfoot
it's just like.. i mean think about it you've

394
00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:36.700
got what. an eight foot or whatever bipedal
monkey man running through the forest you

395
00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:41.870
would have them in museums and bloody zoos
and stuff. there's no way. it just can't happen

396
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:48.610
can it? Whatever. Okay let's just say that
it's bigfoot. Which it definitly isn't.

397
00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:54.590
Well. what happens now? how do we look for
one? how are you gonna find a bigfoot? We

398
00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:59.240
can try tree knocking. Tree knocking. what's
that? You get a lump one you knock it on a

399
00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:05.060
tree and you wait for a response. John. the
exorcism episode is bad enough. no one's going

400
00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:09.022
to believe this are they? Best thing to do
is crack on with the portal scene. if we hear

401
00:39:09.022 --> 00:39:14.419
anything else we can do whatever. Yeah. Fair
enough. i'm just going to try a tree knocking.

402
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:20.050
A what? a tree knock. yeah okay. So what's
this then? tell me what this is about. You

403
00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:24.260
knock on the tree. you wait.

404
00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:30.591
and you wait for a response sometimes they
mimic the sound it comes back. Okay

405
00:39:36.126 --> 00:39:38.126
*knocks on the tree. another knock is heard in response close by*

406
00:39:39.052 --> 00:39:41.052
*Laughing*

407
00:39:43.231 --> 00:39:44.489
You all heard it

408
00:39:46.392 --> 00:39:49.522
That fire is wickedly warm.

409
00:39:49.522 --> 00:39:50.872
It's beautiful isn't it?

410
00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:55.063
Thats the thing. you can't order them from the sky can you?

411
00:39:55.063 --> 00:39:59.189
So you've got to fabricate it

412
00:40:02.419 --> 00:40:11.226
The thing is if i'm pretty sure they do exist
but it's making other people believe they

413
00:40:11.226 --> 00:40:15.503
exist (Steves ringtone)

414
00:40:15.503 --> 00:40:21.490
So why would you want to make other people
believe that they exist? Because they probably

415
00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:26.579
do don't they? they do exist. Yeah I mean.
yeah I believe. i've seen a ufo so i know

416
00:40:26.579 --> 00:40:31.769
they exist but me trying to explain to say..
i don't know. somebody doesn't believe in

417
00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:38.140
ufos. what's the purpose for me apart from
you know i mean getting the weight off my

418
00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:43.700
shoulders sort of thing? Prove to all the
skeptics that they do exist. skepticism though.

419
00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:51.240
skeptics. until they see one with their very
own eyes. as in not on a youtube video not

420
00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:55.560
on anything like that because they're never
going to believe it. you could take. there

421
00:40:55.560 --> 00:41:01.011
could be a ufo land here tonight. a load of
aliens come around chase is all off get all

422
00:41:01.011 --> 00:41:07.060
of it on video and you're not going to believe
it. because they'll think it's cgi. puppets.

423
00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:12.833
little people whatever. But if they see something
with their own eyes that they can't explain

424
00:41:12.833 --> 00:41:16.053
that makes it a ufo. but until then you're
never going to convince some people. You know

425
00:41:17.406 --> 00:41:24.930
i don't think it helps with like the way people
have made money off selling alien stuff. i

426
00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:30.780
mean if someone says an alien to you it's
got like a big head and big funny eyes isn't

427
00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:41.004
it? Like Steve? Yeah a bit like Steve. I'm not
green though I think. This is what i mean are

428
00:41:41.004 --> 00:41:43.840
they green? this is what i mean

429
00:41:45.681 --> 00:41:46.617
*whispers*
It's not doing it now

430
00:41:49.161 --> 00:41:51.161
Okay..

431
00:41:52.304 --> 00:41:55.352
So we've just been woken up by footsteps in the camp

432
00:41:57.878 --> 00:42:05.792
really heavy footsteps. It could be one of
the crew but i don't see why they would.

433
00:42:11.815 --> 00:42:15.786
Surely if you want to go for a wee you're going
to go near your tent.

434
00:42:16.355 --> 00:42:18.355
Yeah yeah yeah

435
00:42:20.289 --> 00:42:21.896
Definitely heavy footsteps.

436
00:42:21.896 --> 00:42:23.372
Yeah. really heavy

437
00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:29.035
And we've heard that whooping sound.
That really strange wooping sound again.

438
00:42:34.378 --> 00:42:36.378
It's coming from over there.

439
00:42:37.823 --> 00:42:39.823
Maybe it's Steve messing about

440
00:42:42.543 --> 00:42:43.452
No

441
00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:45.720
I'm going to have a look

442
00:43:12.843 --> 00:43:14.843
Did you hear that?

443
00:43:21.019 --> 00:43:23.019
Could be Fred?

444
00:43:25.153 --> 00:43:27.153
No. he's snoring

445
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.360
Let's turn this off

446
00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:45.586
yeah this they're supposed to repel them but
it seems to make me attract them.

447
00:43:45.586 --> 00:43:47.586
I think they've evolved mate

448
00:43:47.903 --> 00:43:49.903
He's up

449
00:43:50.228 --> 00:43:52.228
Morning!
Cheers Kirk

450
00:43:53.675 --> 00:43:55.675

ones.

459
00:44:28.792 --> 00:44:35.840
really big one i heard the footsteps but I also heard that whooping noise again did you

460
00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:40.904
hear that? yeah I did. It was steve pissing about again.

461
00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:43.540
Not necessarily Steve

462
00:44:44.268 --> 00:44:46.268
Farmer!

463
00:44:46.607 --> 00:44:47.952
Oh come on. don't give me that look mate

464
00:44:47.952 --> 00:44:49.297
I'm not having a go at you.
I'm just saying..

465
00:44:49.297 --> 00:44:53.120
If you're setting it up dude.
let us know

466
00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:58.649
he's not setting it up
i swear man. All right then

467
00:44:58.649 --> 00:45:00.000
He's not

468
00:45:00.879 --> 00:45:02.879
Okay so. we heard loud noises then

469
00:45:03.191 --> 00:45:05.191
So. it woke you up as well did it? The footsteps.

470
00:45:05.977 --> 00:45:07.977
No you woke me up with your snoring mate

471
00:45:08.328 --> 00:45:10.328
It sounded like you died forty times in your sleep

472
00:45:10.544 --> 00:45:12.064
He got it on camera

473
00:45:12.064 --> 00:45:14.064
I nearly chocked then *laughter*

474
00:45:14.065 --> 00:45:15.454
Like I say we got it on camera

475
00:45:15.454 --> 00:45:16.533
It was loud anyway

476
00:45:16.533 --> 00:45:17.393
We got it on camera

477
00:45:17.393 --> 00:45:20.000
what. the footsteps?
No. you snoring like a
pig

478
00:45:22.096 --> 00:45:23.212
We can still use it I suppose

479
00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:27.520
This whooping sound then. what did it sound like?
was it the same ones before?

480
00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:29.310
like

481
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000
*mimics noise*
Woop

482
00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:36.360
And what time was that then?

483
00:45:36.425 --> 00:45:38.749
Around about the time you went out

484
00:45:39.233 --> 00:45:40.753
That's why I asked if you'd heard it

485
00:45:40.753 --> 00:45:41.694
Oh. half twelve?

486
00:45:41.953 --> 00:45:43.070
Around about then yeah

487
00:45:43.333 --> 00:45:44.853
I didn't hear nothing mate

488
00:45:44.853 --> 00:45:46.221
I did't make any noises anyway

489
00:45:46.221 --> 00:45:47.478
Well it wasn't me

490
00:45:49.617 --> 00:45:53.263
sounded like you could do on your mobile phone
for example. just amplify it

491
00:45:53.797 --> 00:45:55.797
That's why it's louder

492
00:45:55.797 --> 00:46:00.248
just to scare people for example if you're
making a horror film

493
00:46:02.122 --> 00:46:05.831
i'm just saying. He's not. he's not I swear.

494
00:46:06.442 --> 00:46:08.442
I thought he was as well but last night...

495
00:46:08.442 --> 00:46:14.967
I think Kirks on the payroll. I think your on the payroll
i swear at first i thought it was set up

496
00:46:14.967 --> 00:46:19.825
as well. and i'm like now i'm convinced
we were both in here last night [ __ ] ourselves

497
00:46:26.294 --> 00:46:27.469
okay action

498
00:46:32.051 --> 00:46:40.320
so as you can see our second night in camp
was also pretty eventful. Not only did we hear

499
00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:47.290
the strange whooping sounds again but we also
heard bipedal footsteps around our camp.

500
00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:53.510
It got me thinking of the many reports all over
the world of heavy footsteps outside of tents

501
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:58.880
often like us in very remote areas

502
00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:07.460
could this be the mythical sasquatch or is
it the mischievous spirits of the forest.

503
00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:12.510
So you're still going with the bigfoot angle
then yeah? yeah why not? i mean we're not going

504
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:16.960
to see nessie are we and we haven't needed
to exaggerate anything either.

505
00:47:16.961 --> 00:47:19.055
Have you seen Steve?
Um. is he not in his tent?

506
00:47:19.055 --> 00:47:21.753
I've looked all over camp for him mate. his tents empty

507
00:47:21.753 --> 00:47:23.054
He's got my deodorant in his bag

508
00:47:23.054 --> 00:47:24.225
Well he's got be up somewhere

509
00:47:24.226 --> 00:47:27.536
Have you got any deodorant ?
Yeah. I've got a can of spynx.

510
00:47:27.893 --> 00:47:30.591
Can I pinch some?
Yeah.
Spynx.

511
00:47:33.924 --> 00:47:35.593
Your doing a good job there Kirk

512
00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:38.125
Pass that to Steve

513
00:47:38.955 --> 00:47:40.232
where is Steve?

514
00:47:42.029 --> 00:47:43.113
Is he not back yet?

515
00:47:44.379 --> 00:47:45.724
Steve-o

516
00:47:46.097 --> 00:47:47.557
He's probably just gone for a shit

517
00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:49.347
Just give him a call

518
00:47:50.206 --> 00:47:51.398
Here. will you grab that mate?

519
00:47:53.193 --> 00:47:54.846
Is there any more sausages?

520
00:47:55.544 --> 00:47:57.053
when he comes back you can have that i'll
get some more sausages i suppose you can't

521
00:47:58.437 --> 00:48:00.437
I think we need another packet

522
00:48:02.053 --> 00:48:03.442
Is he in his tent. Steve?

523
00:48:04.092 --> 00:48:06.092
I'll put that down here. then when he comes back he can have that.

524
00:48:06.092 --> 00:48:07.433
I'll get some more sausages

525
00:48:07.433 --> 00:48:10.449
I'm surprised he can't smell the food

526
00:48:17.769 --> 00:48:20.573
straight to the answer machine boys

527
00:48:22.702 --> 00:48:23.609
Is it not ringing?

528
00:48:26.063 --> 00:48:30.880
You know what i'm going to do? you know why
he's doing it?
i found the biscuits

529
00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:33.458
Nice.
It's because we're doing that bloody seance today.

530
00:48:33.807 --> 00:48:37.315
He's gone for a walk mate. anything to get out of it.

531
00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:41.068
he's not going to sit around in a circle holding
hands and talking to ghosts is he? it's not

532
00:48:41.068 --> 00:48:44.738
his style. You might as well have that until he comes back.
Has he not done one before?

533
00:48:44.738 --> 00:48:46.738
Steve. Has he not done the seance before?

534
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.917
Didn't he do one at that fricken castle thing?

535
00:48:52.212 --> 00:48:54.212
Oh yeah he did. he got pissed though didnt he?

536
00:48:54.598 --> 00:48:56.598
He doesn't take it seriously.
Yeah yeah

537
00:48:59.185 --> 00:49:01.669
Is that when he drank all them cans first?
Yep

538
00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:08.080
I'm gonna crack another egg

539
00:49:10.869 --> 00:49:12.869
Steve! breakfast

540
00:49:15.681 --> 00:49:20.252
I'm eating your bap. what are you gonna do about it?

541
00:49:21.786 --> 00:49:23.786
*nature sounds*

542
00:49:34.072 --> 00:49:36.072
*wood knocking sounds*

543
00:50:06.127 --> 00:50:19.280
draw upon the energy. So we are gathered here
as a group to respectfully call upon the spirits

544
00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:28.333
of the forest all beings from the earth and
beyond make your presence known to us

545
00:50:29.425 --> 00:50:36.730
we are all part of a universal consciousness
draw upon our energies

546
00:50:38.127 --> 00:50:42.720
there's this robin that keeps coming back
and every time it comes back i get this really

547
00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:48.648
strong reading. it's like mad. So yeah .there
he is look look at that there's a robin as

548
00:50:48.648 --> 00:50:50.240
soon as he comes back that's going to go mental
i swear

549
00:50:51.113 --> 00:50:57.340
so this is what i meant when i was when i
was saying that about the balloon earlier

550
00:50:57.340 --> 00:51:03.700
on and the static because where we are now
feels like we're on the edge of the portal

551
00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:11.840
i can feel it it's like it's like pressing
back on me it's it's like a force met with

552
00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:17.760
my force and also it's there's normally like
the smell of sulfur and i'm getting quite

553
00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:22.480
an eggy smell and that's generally when a
spirit is present or whether something has

554
00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:24.533
just traveled through the portal

555
00:51:26.344 --> 00:51:29.640
I think this
robin is a spirit. i mean it keeps coming back

556
00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:34.591
to the camp and the reading is really high.
It reminds me of the time when i got possessed

557
00:51:34.591 --> 00:51:40.266
by a Harris hawk. And i don't remember the
possession happening but i remember coming

558
00:51:40.266 --> 00:51:46.960
too and when i did come to i just i was flying
over salisbury the whole i just remember seeing

559
00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:49.690
everything from a bird's-eye view

560
00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:55.900
Well he's left his shoes here. but i reckon
he's got his walking boots. Who?

561
00:51:56.499 --> 00:52:00.352
He's left his shoes here but..I reckon he's got his walking boots

562
00:52:00.694 --> 00:52:01.837
Who? Steve?

563
00:52:01.837 --> 00:52:07.007
Of course. Is he not in his tent now? have you checked?
he's not he's definitely not in his

564
00:52:07.007 --> 00:52:09.542
tent mate. we've checked that. i've tried his phone
i'm just getting straight through to the answer

565
00:52:09.542 --> 00:52:15.860
machine his shoes are there but says he's
got walking boots with him so. if he's gone

566
00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:18.571
the shop and not taken a list off everybody
i'll be pissed

567
00:52:19.088 --> 00:52:20.316
Won't you?

568
00:52:21.015 --> 00:52:23.627
Oh my nose is running like mad. that fire's
kicking off

569
00:52:25.721 --> 00:52:33.170
Right look at that. that is a well-established
tree. it's got hardly any branches so it's

570
00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:36.250
not like it's going to get blown. right? What's
going to do that?

571
00:52:38.607 --> 00:52:44.609
You've got to be at least eight foot tall
and probably 30 stone I say.
You reckon?

572
00:52:44.609 --> 00:52:45.609
how

573
00:52:46.493 --> 00:52:50.279
Do you think we could do it? snap it or break it? or push it down?
Well no but..

574
00:52:52.287 --> 00:52:55.481
look at that that was a well-established tree

575
00:52:59.453 --> 00:53:05.876
Okay so. just come across this in the clearing
it's obviously a deer

576
00:53:07.778 --> 00:53:09.900
Not a great deal left of it. his eye sockets
gone

577
00:53:11.559 --> 00:53:17.467
not a lot. not a lot remains of it

578
00:53:17.772 --> 00:53:20.550
it's got two. it's got one
back leg

579
00:53:20.550 --> 00:53:22.552
two front

580
00:53:29.405 --> 00:53:37.687
Yeah strange. there's only badgers and foxes
really. predators in these woods so that's

581
00:53:37.687 --> 00:53:45.280
pretty pretty unusual just left it the bottom
of this tree line

582
00:53:50.891 --> 00:53:51.951
hmm

583
00:53:58.497 --> 00:54:03.850
we are at the end of our third day in the
forests of loch ness. things are getting very

584
00:54:03.850 --> 00:54:10.860
strange here. not only are we hearing strange
noises in the night but one of our team members

585
00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:17.520
steve has gone missing. The popular theory
in camp is that he's gone for a walk but i

586
00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:25.160
think other things are afoot. He's been gone
all day. he's left his shoes behind and he's

587
00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:32.859
not answering any of his phone calls. whether
this is a coincidence or not he disappeared

588
00:54:32.859 --> 00:54:39.770
on the morning after we heard the heavy footsteps
in the camp and of course the shouting

589
00:54:40.599 --> 00:54:49.034
I have my theories but i'm keeping them to
myself. i just hope and pray that i'm wrong

590
00:54:54.948 --> 00:54:56.948
Hey remember Blackpool last year?
Ha yeah

591
00:54:59.510 --> 00:55:03.050
Set up camp on the friday night what did he
do on the saturday night? found a pub. went

592
00:55:03.050 --> 00:55:08.869
on his own and we never saw him again for
the rest of the weekend. So anybody else mate

593
00:55:08.869 --> 00:55:14.057
yeah. he's gone to the pub mate.
i mean how he's found the pub around here

594
00:55:14.057 --> 00:55:19.950
i don't know but i don't know mate it's Steve isn't it?
He'll turn up. he'll wander into camp

595
00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:22.720
at two o'clock in the morning pissed out of
his face.
Yeah.

596
00:55:22.721 --> 00:55:25.540
I agree mate. it's just um how

597
00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:30.630
you'd structure the episode dispose into it.
whether you interview the kids.
Interview the

598
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:35.961
kids but maybe get a group of kids who've
had night terrors.
Yeah that are over it.

599
00:55:35.961 --> 00:55:40.738
Or maybe ones that are still having it and especially..
It's best speaking when they're adults really

600
00:55:40.738 --> 00:55:44.837
Best to speak to them when they are adults about when they were children

601
00:55:44.837 --> 00:55:46.051
Do you know what i mean

602
00:55:46.051 --> 00:55:47.284
Maybe and that yeah

603
00:55:47.859 --> 00:55:52.670
Maybe they could like have a kid being filmed
having a night terror and see what happens.

604
00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:54.337
and see if they can pick up anything...
Whats that up there?

605
00:55:54.338 --> 00:55:55.771
What?

606
00:55:55.771 --> 00:56:01.108
Ah. I told ya..it's Steve isn't it. come on.
No way [ __ ] come on

607
00:56:01.108 --> 00:56:04.160
Let's go. he's going to fall in the f*cking river

608
00:56:08.006 --> 00:56:09.613
Wait for me. I've got the light

609
00:56:15.768 --> 00:56:17.768
*Distant voices*

610
00:56:20.829 --> 00:56:22.829
I told ya

611
00:56:25.287 --> 00:56:28.378
Why is he coming through this way?
He's fell over now I bet you. drunk.

612
00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:35.455
Be prepared to find him o the floor pissed up lads

613
00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:45.443
why would he just hide like that?
Because he's a dick

614
00:56:45.443 --> 00:56:46.764
and he does stuff like that

615
00:56:46.764 --> 00:56:47.761
No man. that's weird man

616
00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:52.042
No. we're falling right into his hands
by even talking about this

617
00:56:53.002 --> 00:56:56.145
Alright Steve. we're gonna nick some beers

618
00:56:56.835 --> 00:56:58.835
Yeah. that was great Steve.

619
00:56:58.835 --> 00:57:00.835
Cheers mate. see you later

620
00:57:01.605 --> 00:57:03.058
Very funny

621
00:57:04.404 --> 00:57:06.971
We will see where he went anyway when we look at the camera footage

622
00:57:09.705 --> 00:57:11.705
*background voices*

623
00:57:15.849 --> 00:57:20.857
So. we just witnessed a strange light off over in the woods

624
00:57:21.609 --> 00:57:23.685
At first we thought it might be Steve

625
00:57:24.116 --> 00:57:27.818
but when we went over to the area. the light was nowhere to be seen

626
00:57:31.891 --> 00:57:33.220
He's actually doing a all-day
long joke

627
00:57:35.892 --> 00:57:36.922
He is actually a little bit crazy

628
00:57:38.189 --> 00:57:40.189
No way!! Come and look at this Jon

629
00:57:45.108 --> 00:57:45.930
Hold on..

630
00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:51.517
Right. hang on. back a bit more

631
00:57:52.187 --> 00:57:54.187
See the light?
Hmm

632
00:57:54.187 --> 00:57:56.187
Right. we go running off

633
00:57:57.099 --> 00:57:59.099
Watch watch

634
00:57:59.099 --> 00:58:00.575
Woh!!!

635
00:58:00.575 --> 00:58:02.449
It just fucking disappeared.
What was that?

636
00:58:03.108 --> 00:58:04.073
What? that's mad

637
00:58:05.615 --> 00:58:07.135
They're trying to make contact

638
00:58:07.479 --> 00:58:09.086
What? who are?

639
00:58:09.412 --> 00:58:11.071
I don't know.
It's a spirit light.

640
00:58:12.525 --> 00:58:15.834
It cant be a ufo. is it? it can't be. can it? no

641
00:58:17.183 --> 00:58:19.041
I'll tell you
what that'll look really good on the show

642
00:58:22.897 --> 00:58:24.897
We'll have to back that up you know

643
00:58:26.348 --> 00:58:29.375
That's good. that's good fucking footage mate

644
00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:33.460
I mean...what the hells that?

645
00:58:33.897 --> 00:58:35.897
I am literally speechless right now

646
00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:38.420
You know what?

647
00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:44.982
Whenever anything happens whether it's um
big foots ufos whatever it's nearly always...

648
00:58:44.982 --> 00:58:48.256
Is that on?
that's on

649
00:58:48.867 --> 00:58:50.396
It's nearly always about strange

650
00:58:50.396 --> 00:58:57.595
lights in the sky there's always a light around
at the time. i'm telling you

651
00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:05.986
right. well no.. i mean i can't explain
that if I'm honest but I dont know

652
00:59:07.601 --> 00:59:13.252
We all saw the light. We saw the light
indeed. That's pretty nuts. That is pretty cool

653
00:59:13.252 --> 00:59:18.012
Is that not the sort of prank that steve would
pull on us though?

654
00:59:18.012 --> 00:59:18.820
I don't know

655
00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:21.257
He aint that clever mate.
I know he's a bit thick

656
00:59:21.955 --> 00:59:24.653
It did look very good though. if that was him..

657
00:59:25.170 --> 00:59:27.019
well done steve if that was you mate.

658
00:59:27.019 --> 00:59:30.000
Yeah well done for making an orb just go into the sky and disappear

659
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.089
Come back and take
the credit man because that was ace

660
00:59:36.013 --> 00:59:41.150
That does look very cool and you got
it on camera.
That looked mint

661
00:59:41.151 --> 00:59:42.110
That did look mint

662
00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:45.500
It didn't make a sound though.
there's no noise from it was there?

663
00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:51.020
I didn't hear nothing.So it had gone. it's like it
reacted to us coming towards it

664
00:59:51.456 --> 00:59:54.736
So it was there..it was moving wasn't it?
So we scared it off?

665
00:59:54.736 --> 00:59:57.875
So was it blue? like a blueish light?
I don't know

666
00:59:59.490 --> 01:00:05.630
So if it wasn't a ufo then maybe it was a
spirit light? yeah but it was like it reacted

667
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:10.355
to us coming didn't it? it was like moving
then it was like whoa! what's the difference

668
01:00:10.355 --> 01:00:13.883
between a spirit light and a ufo? One's a spirit
light and one's a ufo.

669
01:00:15.201 --> 01:00:17.985
And one's bloody Steve.
Steve!

670
01:00:18.378 --> 01:00:23.006
What is it? is it a ufo? is it a spirit light?
or is it a mate being a right [ __ ] in the

671
01:00:23.006 --> 01:00:28.207
bush? I'll tell you what. I'll.. I'll come.. i'll
come a little bit on your side of the fence

672
01:00:28.207 --> 01:00:31.877
here John. if it was Steve and he's heard our
reaction to that he would come over and take

673
01:00:31.877 --> 01:00:37.997
the credit for it. I will say that much.
He would not be able to stop himself from

674
01:00:37.997 --> 01:00:44.812
coming over and gloating like that. That would be his final little . what do you call it? cherry on the cake.

675
01:00:44.812 --> 01:00:48.760
So i'm i'm i'm a little bit concerned
about Steve boys. i'll be honest because i

676
01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:51.055
genuinely thought that was him

677
01:01:06.525 --> 01:01:08.339
What was that?
Did you hear that?

678
01:01:08.863 --> 01:01:09.863
What is it?

679
01:01:19.373 --> 01:01:21.373
*whooping sound*

680
01:01:29.836 --> 01:01:31.836
*louder whooping*

681
01:01:32.233 --> 01:01:34.233
What the hell?

682
01:01:39.550 --> 01:01:42.248
Shine your torch over there.
What was that?

683
01:01:42.248 --> 01:01:45.451
Dont shine the torch. put the torch down.
What do you mean?

684
01:01:45.451 --> 01:01:50.000
Okay yeah. let them come out of the dark. nice one

685
01:02:01.862 --> 01:02:05.974
*Distant wood knocks*

686
01:02:10.832 --> 01:02:11.953
*Strange vocal sound*

687
01:02:16.792 --> 01:02:18.792
This is nuts man

688
01:02:23.694 --> 01:02:25.502
I can't even look

689
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:29.415
i've never heard anything like that

690
01:02:34.061 --> 01:02:37.097
How far away is that? that's pretty far away right?

691
01:02:38.839 --> 01:02:40.589
Right what we doin? because I'm not staying here

692
01:02:40.801 --> 01:02:43.935
I'm not staying here either. And that is definitely not Steve

693
01:02:44.212 --> 01:02:53.880
Right. if Steve is not back first thing in the morning then we go. Mate.
he's had plenty of time to come back. i say

694
01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:58.811
we go now. Yeah i'm up for it mate. I'm up
for doing that. Yeah i'm going man yeah deffo.

695
01:02:58.811 --> 01:03:00.200
Now?
Yeah

696
01:03:00.201 --> 01:03:03.118
Fuck that. Whatever that is. it's got Steve.

697
01:03:03.582 --> 01:03:05.713
It'll come and get us in a minute so I say we peg it now

698
01:03:06.598 --> 01:03:09.378
First light mate.
Yes. cool. safe

699
01:03:09.597 --> 01:03:12.246
Or else we are going to be stumbling in the dark. first light.

700
01:03:14.516 --> 01:03:23.531
I mean lets look at this.it's obviously someone pissing about but i
mean that's.. that's.. that's something

701
01:03:23.531 --> 01:03:31.200
else .that's yeah. there's pissing about
and then.. that's scary do you know what I mean?

702
01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:34.402
Jon.what do you think man?
I think..

703
01:03:36.790 --> 01:03:41.583
okay i think we get our stuff ready but we
do stay and then go first light.

704
01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:45.336
Are we all sleeping in the same tent or something. I mean I'm not...

705
01:03:45.337 --> 01:03:47.170
I'm not going to sleep tonight mate

706
01:03:47.170 --> 01:03:48.609
If we all get our stuff together.

707
01:03:48.609 --> 01:03:55.373
Yeah. don't anybody go wandering around
alone. You reckon? yeah. that's not gonna happen.

708
01:03:55.373 --> 01:03:56.883
Definitely not

709
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:07.413
okay it's 4am and i think a couple of

710
01:04:07.413 --> 01:04:13.262
the lads have gone to sleep it's been a very

711
01:04:13.262 --> 01:04:25.949
strange day. Steve still hasn't come back. the
light in the forest and now screaming i do

712
01:04:25.949 --> 01:04:31.752
believe that what we're dealing with here
is paranormal in origin

713
01:04:33.542 --> 01:04:41.630
the mixture between ufo and potential cryptids
all lead to the portal

714
01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:54.380
Either way. for the safety of our team we're
going to be heading home in the morning

715
01:04:55.558 --> 01:04:58.834
I think we have more than enough evidence on
film.

716
01:05:03.114 --> 01:05:05.463
The john farmer in me wants to stick

717
01:05:05.463 --> 01:05:14.059
around. but my gut feeling is telling me to
leave. If this really is a cryptid let's. say..

718
01:05:14.059 --> 01:05:20.387
sasquatch that we're dealing with here. then
we need to take note of what the first nation

719
01:05:20.387 --> 01:05:26.989
tribes say. if you come into contact with these
beings you are very unlikely to live to tell

720
01:05:26.989 --> 01:05:28.709
the tale

721
01:05:30.339 --> 01:05:37.151
Hundreds of people go missing in national
parks every year. it makes you wonder

722
01:05:38.932 --> 01:05:42.491
Morning.
Did you hear anything else last night?

723
01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:45.320
No. nothing thank God

724
01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:47.324
Daz? You hear anything else?

725
01:05:48.797 --> 01:05:50.000
No mate

726
01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:52.500
What's that?
Leaving a note for Steve

727
01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:54.875
For if he decides to show up.
Good idea

728
01:05:54.875 --> 01:05:57.050
Tell him he's a dick.
I have done. he is a dick.

729
01:06:00.996 --> 01:06:02.996
I thought it could have been the locals though

730
01:06:05.626 --> 01:06:09.738
But i've never heard anything like that ever.
like it could have been an animal or some

731
01:06:09.738 --> 01:06:11.174
creature or..

732
01:06:14.535 --> 01:06:23.005
I don't know mate. i mean you gotta look at it
this way i mean locals i mean what locals?

733
01:06:23.005 --> 01:06:26.637
how many people have we seen when we've been
here? nobody. we haven't seen anybody there's

734
01:06:26.637 --> 01:06:32.982
no locals around here. I thought it could have
been jon setting it up but...look at him.

735
01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:35.240
Yeah.
That's not Jon is it?

736
01:06:36.491 --> 01:06:38.491
We gonna sort these tents out or what?

737
01:06:38.491 --> 01:06:40.229
We need to get fucking out of here mate

738
01:06:40.229 --> 01:06:42.229
Forget the tents.
He'd be persuading us to stay.

739
01:06:42.229 --> 01:06:44.229
What. we're leaving the tents here?
We are leaving the tents here

740
01:06:44.229 --> 01:06:46.229
Let's get the hell out of here. we can come back for them.

741
01:06:46.229 --> 01:06:49.495
Well we've got to take our stuff obviously.
We'll take our stuff. just travel light.

742
01:06:53.109 --> 01:07:00.840
So our first time here at loch ness has come
to a close.. come to a close? End. And so our first

743
01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:05.980
time here at loch ness has come to an end
with a few nights of strange happenings increasing

744
01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:12.950
in intensity. we've decided that the safety
of our team has to be a priority. Ufos. strange

745
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:22.250
beasts wandering the night and the unholy
screams one thing is for sure loch ness has

746
01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:30.932
many more mysteries to be solved. I'm john
farmer john join me next time on there's something

747
01:07:30.932 --> 01:07:32.562

Wait. wait up

749
01:07:43.633 --> 01:07:45.633

It's a person

754
01:08:16.639 --> 01:08:18.862
Mate that's Steve.

755
01:08:19.229 --> 01:08:21.229
I'll give him a call.

756
01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:28.760

819
01:13:06.502 --> 01:13:08.502
Fred we need to keep moving mate

820
01:13:08.502 --> 01:13:10.895
Lets get a move on guys. Hang on. before we go any further.

821
01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:13.855
can I at least just check?
Well check it then

822
01:13:14.511 --> 01:13:16.614
I'll just get the compass out.
What do you need that for?

823
01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:20.393
Make sure we're still going south.
Navigation has got us to the side of a cliff boys.

824
01:13:28.349 --> 01:13:30.327
oh we got a problem here

825
01:13:30.763 --> 01:13:34.116
The compass isn't moving.
Yeah exactly it's not moving

826
01:13:34.116 --> 01:13:35.287
Well what does that mean?

827
01:13:35.287 --> 01:13:37.362
Why is it not moving? how is that possible? Ive got no idea

828
01:13:37.362 --> 01:13:38.303
That. hold on...

829
01:13:39.284 --> 01:13:41.040
that's the electromagnetic field

830
01:13:42.373 --> 01:13:46.844
Wheres the emf metre?
Compasses don't just break. Get your toys out mate.

831
01:13:46.844 --> 01:13:51.739
great time to play with your toys. brilliant. Well
we've got to check haven't we? see if the compasses broke.

832
01:13:51.739 --> 01:13:55.397
what are you checking for? It's gonna take
two seconds. give me that give me that meter

833
01:13:58.781 --> 01:14:02.080
Look at that.
So..so what's that mean?
It's going absolutely mental.

834
01:14:02.861 --> 01:14:07.020
Well in a supernatural
sense it means..It means we have to go come on let's

835
01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:12.090
go. I'm calling the police again boys.
Good luck with that. We got to keep heading south.

836
01:14:12.090 --> 01:14:16.040
well that's the direction we've been going for an
hour. we don't know. If we just look like we're

837
01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:18.691
going in a straight line the compass is not
working we can't go to the compass

838
01:14:18.691 --> 01:14:19.520
anymore

839
01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.520
Let's just keep going.
Brilliant plan.

840
01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:24.320
I'm going to turn this off

841
01:14:27.376 --> 01:14:29.376
*Distant tree knocking*

842
01:14:41.639 --> 01:14:45.920
If you are tracking our last location. we have moved away.
Good luck with that.

843
01:14:46.324 --> 01:14:48.654
If the compass is on south how will they track our location?

844
01:14:48.654 --> 01:14:51.693
it's gps . I told you before.
Yeah but it's not going to work is it.
We need to keep moving.

845
01:14:52.125 --> 01:14:53.645
I lost signal

846
01:14:59.463 --> 01:15:03.284
If you want to tell us what this is in the
woods you just go ahead and do it will ya?

I haven't got a signal dont follow me

850
01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:29.358
If we keep going in this direction we've got
to come to a road or something. surely.

851
01:15:30.492 --> 01:15:34.348
Why aren't we getting anywhere? i swear we've walked
past these trees half an hour ago. We must

852
01:15:34.348 --> 01:15:41.396
be coming up on a road soon. Put your camera
away mate and check that we're not going around

853
01:15:41.396 --> 01:15:44.754
in circles. I told you what I'm doing. i'm trying

as part of your little film. Don't you think

People going missing. the blood. the stuff hanging
in the tree. Yeah how do we know that that

879
01:17:57.501 --> 01:18:01.910

Well your gonna have to try aren't you? Give me that stick.

885

You can't stay here can you with whatever is out there?

886
01:18:29.764 --> 01:18:32.375
I'd rather stay here than be with fucking him

01:18:32.375 --> 01:18:34.950
Well he's stressed isn't he?

I want to get out as well. so.
This aint gonna work.

890
01:18:43.109 --> 01:18:45.284
It is. just don't put all your weight on it.

891
01:18:45.284 --> 01:18:47.284
It'll take forever. it's going to get dark.

892
01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:54.669
Alright Jon?

Well it's helping you to walk isn't it?

894
01:18:56.014 --> 01:18:57.600
Sorry mate. I'll find you a crutch.

895
01:18:57.600 --> 01:18:59.731
Something with a bit sticking out at least

896
01:19:02.751 --> 01:19:07.360
It's going dark man.
Daz. slow down mate.

897
01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:09.360
What?
Nothing.

898
01:19:16.276 --> 01:19:19.806
We need to get somewhere higher up. at least we can
see where we are then.

899
01:19:21.112 --> 01:19:22.112
Where?

900
01:19:22.639 --> 01:19:24.032
Where's higher?

901
01:19:26.434 --> 01:19:28.434
I don't know

902
01:19:37.165 --> 01:19:39.165
Fucks sake

903
01:19:48.923 --> 01:19:50.443
You alright Jon?
Yeah.

904
01:19:51.193 --> 01:19:52.321
Dandy

905
01:19:56.110 --> 01:19:59.725
See any roads? No. Nothing at all? No

906
01:20:02.343 --> 01:20:04.343
There's a mountain over there

907
01:20:06.393 --> 01:20:13.626
That's not the one we came in on is it? the
mountain? No. no. because..I cant see nothing

908
01:20:13.626 --> 01:20:16.077
there's no roads. are you sure we haven't been here before
in fact?

909
01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:22.393
We better keep moving

910
01:20:25.523 --> 01:20:27.523
The suns going down. that's it

911
01:20:28.148 --> 01:20:30.541
This is utter bollocks.
I'm not walking around there at night.

912
01:20:30.541 --> 01:20:31.930
Or limping around there at night

913
01:20:31.930 --> 01:20:39.189
We can't go this way now can we? look at it.
just dense forest. nothing anywhere. And i can't

914
01:20:39.189 --> 01:20:40.189
get down there.

915
01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:58.812
So it's 1am. we've had to pitch a tent .we're
still lost and we don't want to be running

916
01:20:58.812 --> 01:21:02.956
around in the woods with whatever it is that's
out there

917
01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:11.152
We haven't had a fire and we're trying to
be really quiet because we don't want to attract

918
01:21:11.152 --> 01:21:20.623
any attention to ourselves. We've got no battery
left on our phones. which isn't great but as

919
01:21:20.623 --> 01:21:22.782
soon as the sun comes up

920
01:21:24.527 --> 01:21:28.934
we're gonna head in the same direction and we are
gonna find a way out of these woods

921
01:21:32.276 --> 01:21:34.276
Right. I'll turn it off.
Yeah

922
01:21:42.199 --> 01:21:44.199
*Loud screaming from the forest*

923
01:21:44.199 --> 01:21:46.199
Shit!
What the flipping heck was that?

924
01:21:46.199 --> 01:21:48.199
Shh. keep it down man

925
01:21:53.582 --> 01:21:55.582
*loud screaming*

926
01:21:56.616 --> 01:21:57.830
Quiet

927
01:22:08.118 --> 01:22:10.118
What the heck? what's that?

928
01:22:14.123 --> 01:22:16.123
Oh my God
Jesus

929
01:22:22.206 --> 01:22:24.206
Come on. go

930
01:22:33.393 --> 01:22:35.393
Which way? down here

931
01:22:49.070 --> 01:22:51.070
*snapping and choking sound*

932
01:22:55.969 --> 01:22:58.624
Woh woh. what was that?

933
01:22:59.577 --> 01:23:02.276

934
01:23:04.165 --> 01:23:05.670

935
01:23:08.812 --> 01:23:11.023

936
01:23:11.983 --> 01:23:13.588
Mate is that?

937
01:23:13.588 --> 01:23:15.588
Can you see? Is that Fred?
