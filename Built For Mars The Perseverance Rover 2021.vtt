In a few minutes.

6
00:00:10.927 --> 00:00:12.887
the Perseverance rover
will be on the ground.

7
00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:19.185
It's on a mission
like nothing ever done before.

8
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.860
Searching for traces of life
in an ancient river delta.

9
00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:33.783
And collecting samples
for return to Earth.

10
00:00:35.952 --> 00:00:39.956
To get this far. its creators have endured
gut-wrenching setbacks.

11
00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:41.583
and a global pandemic.

12
00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:50.341
Thousands of people played
a role to make this happen.

13
00:00:53.094 --> 00:00:56.973
But only a few have ever touched
this marvel of human ingenuity.

14
00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:01.936
It takes great minds
to build something like this.

15
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.523
It also takes great hands.

16
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.288
ADAM: A spacecraft.

17
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.125
A NASA spacecraft
of highfalutin. big ideas.

18
00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:26.961
but in the end. it is handmade.

19
00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:32.884
It's put together by technicians.

20
00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:38.056
And so. you have this great contrast
between heady theoretical ideas.

21
00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:42.811
and engineering science.
and craftsmanship. workmanship.

22
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.106
And by the way. it's... that's a big deal.

23
00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:48.650
Because all the heady ideas
don't go anywhere

24
00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:50.902
without it coming together the right way.

25
00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:56.032
We're gonna stick the spacecraft
on a rocket.

26
00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:59.077
light it up. and hurl it off towards Mars.

27
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.163
There will be no intervention
once we're done with this.

28
00:02:02.872 --> 00:02:05.375
We're gonna have what we have.
And if something's not right.

29
00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:08.711
or if there's a little tiny machine screw
rattling around in there...

30
00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:11.798
we're gonna... this...
the whole mission can be lost.

MOOGEGA: As you design
and build a spacecraft.

32
00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:20.056
there are always hurdles that come up.
it's never perfect.

33
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.891
it's never exactly as you plan.

34
00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:26.437
So. engineers obviously are critical
and pivotal to designing and testing.

35
00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:30.525
But the flight techs. they're the people
making sure that what they put together

36
00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:32.735
is going to work on Mars.

37
00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:36.698
It's crucial to have everyone
hand in hand. working together.

38
00:02:36.865 --> 00:02:38.366
-MALE TECH 1: Okay. crane ops.
-MALE TECH 2: Crane ops.

39
00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:41.452
CHRISTIAN: You don't have to have
a college degree to do this.

40
00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:43.621
but all us techs do have a role.

41
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.833
It's not like you can go on Amazon
and order one of these spacecraft.

42
00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:48.793
-MALE TECH 1: Good?
-MALE TECH 2: Yeah. it sure is.

JIM: Flight technicians are
the only group that's allowed

44
00:02:52.755 --> 00:02:54.507
to handle flight hardware.

45
00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:56.467
MALE TECH 1: Okay.
Zack wants to do the first.

46
00:02:56.634 --> 00:02:58.928
JIM: We're unlike any other place
on the planet.

47
00:02:59.095 --> 00:03:02.182
We're not industry.
we're not pushing the techs

48
00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:04.893
to get things done quickly.
it's all about perfection.

LACK: We're mechanics.
putting together a spacecraft.

51
00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:13.776
It might be a little bit
more sophisticated than being

52
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.321
a grease mechanic. you know.
on an engine.

53
00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:19.574
but basically. we're. you know.
just space mechanics.

54
00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:21.159
MALE TECH: You just tell me you...

55
00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:24.037
MICHAEL: We're good with our hands.
so we're good with tools. you know.

56
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.163
This is what I do

57
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.083
and if that leads to building
a spacecraft. then that's what I build.

58
00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:36.299
JAMES: My understanding of theoretical
and design elements is limited.

59
00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:39.761
but I'm the caretaker
of many years of scientific effort.

60
00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:43.097
Countless man hours
of mechanical engineers.

61
00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:44.182
the design engineers.

62
00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:47.477
So. behind that one piece
could be hundreds of people.

63
00:03:47.977 --> 00:03:50.772
And we are entrusted with that system.

64
00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:56.361
NARRATOR: Perseverance
has the same basic design

65
00:03:56.444 --> 00:03:59.989
as the curiosity rover
that's been on Mars since 2012.

66
00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:02.617
But the payload is all new.

67
00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:07.830
The centerpiece
is a complex robotic system

68
00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:10.500
to drill and cache samples
of Martian rock

69
00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:12.669
for return to Earth by a future mission.

WILLIFORD: The idea of sending spacecraft
to Mars.

grabbing some samples
and bringing them back.

72
00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:23.179
this is something that scientists
and engineers have wanted to do

73
00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:25.765
for a very long time. many decades.

74
00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:28.518

over the past 60 years.

91
00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:32.623
Every one of them. born from the marriage
of visionary engineering.

92
00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:34.751
and elite hands-on skills.

93

MALE TECH: Uh. we're gonna go east.

94
00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:40.381
NARRATOR: At this level.
some of those hands-on skills

95
00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:42.717
are as unique as the hardware
they're building.

96
00:05:43.384 --> 00:05:46.596
ADAM: You can go to school
to train to fix jet engines.

97
00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:49.349
because there's lots of jets.
and they need jet engine technicians.

98
00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:52.602
but there's no school
for spacecraft technicians that I know of.

99
00:05:54.937 --> 00:05:57.398
NARRATOR: The closest thing
to a school for flight technicians

100
00:05:57.523 --> 00:06:00.068
is JPL's legendary Building 18.

101
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.738
JIM: This is the hub
for the flight technicians.

102
00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:05.698
One of the oldest buildings on the lab.

103
00:06:05.823 --> 00:06:08.910
It's been here about 60 years.
and from here.

104
00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:10.995
we're dispersed all across the whole lab.

105
00:06:14.332 --> 00:06:18.127
NARRATOR: Jim Pearson started
as a flight tech more than 25 years ago.

106
00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:21.589
Now. he's the boss. and head talent scout.

107
00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:25.176
recruiting people with the right stuff
to work on spacecraft.

108
00:06:26.677 --> 00:06:28.388
JIM: I'm looking for an attitude.

109
00:06:29.138 --> 00:06:32.058
Somebody who's willing to dig deep.

110
00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:35.520
Somebody who can understand
the importance

111
00:06:35.603 --> 00:06:36.687
of the work that we're doing.

112
00:06:38.981 --> 00:06:41.526
JAMES: If you can come in
with the right mindset.

113
00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:44.654
then you can be trained
how to work on spacecraft.

114
00:06:46.614 --> 00:06:49.409
I remember very clearly
the first hole I drilled.

115
00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.455
Here I am. with a drill. in a clean room.
with four people watching me.

116
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.500
and I'm dealing with hardware
that's worth millions of dollars.

117
00:06:58.126 --> 00:07:01.212
So. if I mess up.
that could be catastrophic.

118
00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:04.173
So... and I was reminded of that
before I did it.

119
00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:06.759
and I was sweating.
I was sweating bullets.

120
00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:12.014
STEVE: Prior to JPL.
I was working in a bike shop.

121
00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:16.561
You know. I'm used to having grease
and dirt under my cuticles.

122
00:07:16.644 --> 00:07:18.354
So. coming into a clean room

123
00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:20.898
is a big eye-opener.
It was a culture shock.

124
00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:24.610
You don't wanna be too fast moving.

125
00:07:24.735 --> 00:07:27.280
You don't wanna bump into anything.

ADAM: The technicians
are a bit like... a surgeon.

132
00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:51.721
In that...

133
00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:55.808
a slip of the hand... um. a mistake.

134
00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:58.561
and you really can lose the patient.

135
00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:01.814

138
00:08:07.236 --> 00:08:09.113
Even the veterans feel the pressure.

139
00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:13.409
PATRICIA: You have to be able
to really kind of block it out.

140
00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:16.329
and not get nervous.
even though they could say.

141
00:08:16.412 --> 00:08:19.832
"Oh. that's a two million dollar camera."
you know.

142
00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:23.711
And so. you just say. "Don't tell me."

MICHAEL: I put in six screws in one day.

144
00:08:27.256 --> 00:08:30.343
and come home exhausted
because my level of focus

145
00:08:30.426 --> 00:08:32.470
on those six screws was so intense.

146
00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:35.181
They have to be so perfect.
everything has to be so right

147
00:08:35.264 --> 00:08:38.017
and exact that you come home
and go. "Why am I so tired?

148
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.352
"All I did was six screws."

149
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.231
It comes back to the complexity
of what we're building.

150
00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:46.442
You can't do this and not have problems.

151

ADAM: Look. I'm an engineer.

153
00:08:54.575 --> 00:08:57.578
Up here. on this floor.
in our offices where we engineer

154
00:08:57.662 --> 00:09:00.540
the spacecraft.
it's intellectually collaborative.

155
00:09:00.748 --> 00:09:02.875
"Whoa. what's...
that's an interesting idea you have.

156
00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:04.126
"I like that." Right?

"Let's think about that."
Blah. blah. blah.

158

Down there. it's actual
touch labor collaboration.

When you design a spacecraft.

161
00:09:17.014 --> 00:09:20.351
one of its greatest challenges
is actually being made.

It won't get its name.
Perseverance. for another year.

169
00:09:50.631 --> 00:09:53.175
For now. it's just "The 2020 Rover."

170
00:09:53.467 --> 00:09:58.431
still waiting for its wheels. robotic arm.
cameras. and all the rest of its toolkit.

171
00:10:01.475 --> 00:10:03.769
Meanwhile. it's filling up
with the electronics

172
00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:06.272
that will run all the hardware
still being built.

173
00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:10.818
ADAM: We have this phase
of the mission called ATLO.

174
00:10:10.901 --> 00:10:14.238
which means. Assembly. Test.
and Launch Operations.

175
00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:16.657
But along with being
a phase of the mission.

176
00:10:16.782 --> 00:10:20.202
it's this army of people.
it's like a Seal Teams almost.

177
00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:24.665
very carefully chosen.
very select group of people.

178
00:10:24.832 --> 00:10:27.293
that physically build our spacecraft.

179
00:10:29.337 --> 00:10:31.922
JIM: ATLO is where
everything comes together.

180
00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:34.842
The integration
of all the major components.

181
00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:38.179
The ATLO team will eventually
be on the launch pad.

182
00:10:38.262 --> 00:10:40.723
They'll be conducting
launch pad operations.

183
00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:46.145
NARRATOR: The ATLO team is responsible
not only for assembling the spacecraft.

184
00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:47.813
but for making sure that it works

185
00:10:47.897 --> 00:10:50.316
as a system
when all the parts are put together.

186
00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.201
The rover doesn't fly to Mars by itself.

187
00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:05.790
The cruise stage manages
the journey from Earth to Mars.

188
00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:08.959
Then separates just before arrival.

189
00:11:12.129 --> 00:11:14.548
Then comes
the "Seven minutes of terror..."

190
00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:20.429
as the spacecraft decelerates
from 12.000 miles an hour

191
00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.306
to a gentle touchdown.

192
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.103
Radio commands at the speed
of light will take 11 minutes

193
00:11:27.186 --> 00:11:30.564
from Earth to Mars.
so the spacecraft is on its own.

194
00:11:33.901 --> 00:11:36.612
The aeroshell carries it through
the fiery collision

195
00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:38.114
with the Martian atmosphere.

196
00:11:42.284 --> 00:11:45.621
Then. deploys the parachute
from its mortar.

197
00:11:46.372 --> 00:11:47.540
(PARACHUTE FLUTTERS)

198
00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:51.335
NARRATOR: The heat shield drops off.

199
00:11:56.215 --> 00:11:59.802
And the rocket-powered descent stage
takes it the rest of the way in.

200
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.562
Finally.
there's the acrobatic sky crane maneuver.

201
00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:18.362
And then. the rover is on Mars.

202
00:12:21.907 --> 00:12:24.702
FEMALE TECH:
Let's start pushing north east.

203
00:12:25.536 --> 00:12:26.829
MALE ENGINEER: North east.

204
00:12:27.121 --> 00:12:28.164
Slowly.

205
00:12:30.332 --> 00:12:31.584
NARRATOR: Over the next few weeks.

206
00:12:31.959 --> 00:12:34.795
they'll be temporarily stacking
all those parts together

207
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.299
for a brutal series of tests.
simulating the trip to Mars.

208
00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:45.389
The rover's not ready yet.
so they have a mass model dummy inside

209
00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:47.683
to get the correct weight
and center of gravity.

210
00:12:50.102 --> 00:12:53.731
JIM: It's major work.
It's heavy lifts. critical lifts.

211
00:12:54.231 --> 00:12:56.650
millions of dollars in hardware.

212
00:12:56.984 --> 00:13:01.697
So. the smallest little mistake
can be huge.

213
00:13:01.947 --> 00:13:03.365
-MALE TECH 1: On the crane.
-MALE TECH 2: Crane.

214
00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:06.702
-MALE TECH 1: East. slow.
-MALE TECH 2: East. slow.

215
00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:07.828
(OBJECT CLACKING)

216
00:13:07.953 --> 00:13:09.789
NARRATOR:
Engineers direct the lifts.

217
00:13:10.372 --> 00:13:11.749
but only technicians.

218
00:13:11.832 --> 00:13:14.710
and only the most experienced
can operate the crane.

219
00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:16.754
-TONI: Okay. stop.
-MALE TECH: Stop.

220
00:13:16.837 --> 00:13:18.923
DAVID:
It's a potentially dangerous situation.

221
00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:21.258
And so. doing it safely.
making sure you have

222
00:13:21.342 --> 00:13:22.468
everything hooked up right.

223
00:13:22.551 --> 00:13:25.346
making sure
you haven't missed something is key.

224
00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:28.140
and that's a place
where experience comes into play.

225
00:13:34.021 --> 00:13:36.732
MICHAEL: You're now swinging
a few tons in the air.

226
00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:38.734
And there are hazards there.

227
00:13:39.276 --> 00:13:42.822
By the sheer size of the spacecraft.
you can't see all around it.

228
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:46.909
You have to trust that that person
on the other side is doing their job.

229
00:13:47.034 --> 00:13:48.452
MALE TECH: Down on. slow.

230
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:50.830
TONI: Okay.

231
00:13:55.417 --> 00:13:57.086
JAMES: There are certain key moments
that...

232
00:13:57.419 --> 00:13:58.838
it just takes your breath away.

233
00:13:59.046 --> 00:14:01.674
Seeing the spacecraft stacked
for the first time.

234
00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:04.844
you're reminded that this is real.
this is happening.

235
00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:06.554
this massive collaboration.

236
00:14:06.762 --> 00:14:09.223
And I have all of that work in my hands.

237
00:14:10.057 --> 00:14:11.767
At that point. you saw

238
00:14:12.268 --> 00:14:14.311
the complete spacecraft
that's gonna fly to Mars.

239
00:14:22.444 --> 00:14:24.530
NARRATOR: The stacked spacecraft
is now ready

240
00:14:24.655 --> 00:14:26.824
for its first major system test.

241
00:14:30.411 --> 00:14:34.540
Over the next 12 days.
inside a space simulation chamber.

242
00:14:34.957 --> 00:14:37.710
it will have to prove it can function
in the frigid vacuum

243
00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:41.505
of deep space on its seven-month journey
to Mars.

244
00:14:48.095 --> 00:14:51.140
WILLIFORD:
Has life ever existed beyond Earth?

245
00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.767
Does it today? Has it ever?

246
00:14:54.226 --> 00:14:56.896
Has life ever emerged
on another planet?

247
00:14:57.479 --> 00:15:00.107
You know. as astrobiologists.
we believe it must have.

248
00:15:00.232 --> 00:15:01.817
But right now. we have no evidence.

249
00:15:02.818 --> 00:15:03.944
So. we're going to Mars.

250
00:15:04.028 --> 00:15:06.488
we're collecting the first samples
from another planet.

251
00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:09.033
with the intention of. one day.
bringing them back

252
00:15:09.241 --> 00:15:11.660
to our most powerful laboratories
on Earth.

253
00:15:11.869 --> 00:15:14.538
and we can analyze them
for signs of ancient life

254
00:15:14.622 --> 00:15:18.626
with instruments
that are way too big to ever fly to Mars.

255
00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:23.047
We're headed to a place
called Jezero Crater.

256
00:15:23.714 --> 00:15:26.216
The big signpost is the delta.

257
00:15:26.717 --> 00:15:28.427
Up in the northwest corner.

258
00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:30.930
we see this beautiful fan-shaped feature.

259
00:15:31.013 --> 00:15:34.224
and a delta really only forms on Earth

260
00:15:34.475 --> 00:15:38.395
where you get a river flowing
into a standing body of water.

261
00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.067
That tells us very clearly
that three some billion years ago.

262
00:15:43.192 --> 00:15:45.653
there was a lake in Jezero Crater.

263
00:15:45.736 --> 00:15:50.491
A great place for life to survive
and thrive. if it ever emerged on Mars.

264
00:15:52.242 --> 00:15:57.039
We know exactly where we're going now.
And it's an incredibly exciting time.

265
00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:00.417
NARRATOR: A lot of 2020 scientists.

266
00:16:00.542 --> 00:16:03.462
like Ken Williford.
trained as field geologists.

267
00:16:03.754 --> 00:16:06.590
exploring landscapes
and unraveling stories

268
00:16:06.674 --> 00:16:08.425
rocks can tell about the past.

269
00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:12.680
With a rover on Mars. though.
they'll have to work from home.

270
00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:19.061
They've been practicing
remote geology.

271
00:16:19.687 --> 00:16:22.606
One team out in the desert.
playing the rover on Mars.

272
00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:24.024
And we got all these cables here.

273
00:16:24.108 --> 00:16:25.859
NARRATOR: Pointing cameras
at rock formations.

274
00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:28.195
and streaming the images back to JPL.

275
00:16:29.488 --> 00:16:31.490
Another team at JPL.

276
00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:34.201
practicing how they'll interpret images
from Mars.

277
00:16:34.284 --> 00:16:36.453
and make decisions about what to do next.

278
00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.583
Then. they visit the site to see
what it looks like in person.

279
00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.753
KATIE: Everyone was looking
at the images on their computer.

280
00:16:44.878 --> 00:16:48.424
looking at the data. you know.
very remotely. just like we do on Mars.

281
00:16:48.549 --> 00:16:50.509
But it's really a different kind
of experience

282
00:16:50.592 --> 00:16:52.177
when you can come out here as a person.

283
00:16:52.386 --> 00:16:54.430
and look at the rocks yourself
with your own eyes.

284
00:16:54.805 --> 00:16:58.392
and point the instrument at the outcrop.
and get that data back real time.

285
00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:00.019
And I think it just gives people

286
00:17:00.102 --> 00:17:03.522
a new perspective on the observations
that come down from a rover.

287
00:17:04.606 --> 00:17:07.609
It reminds you that when you are looking
at the images that are on Mars.

288
00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:09.194
there's a whole field site there.

289
00:17:09.278 --> 00:17:10.529
So. that's why it...

290
00:17:15.826 --> 00:17:17.536
NARRATOR: They have to travel
a bit farther

291
00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:20.122
to see what the jackpot on Mars
might look like.

292
00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.711
KEN: The key reason we came
to this locality

293
00:17:25.794 --> 00:17:28.672
in the middle of the outback
is rocks like this.

294
00:17:28.797 --> 00:17:30.758
Rocks like this are extremely rare.

295
00:17:31.633 --> 00:17:33.594
What's very special about them
is they have evidence

296
00:17:33.677 --> 00:17:36.096
of the earliest life on Earth.

297
00:17:36.263 --> 00:17:39.808
And they tell us
what we should be looking for on Mars.

298
00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:44.146
WILLIFORD: When we say with Mars 2020.
we're seeking the signs

299
00:17:44.271 --> 00:17:45.564
of ancient life on Mars.

300
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:50.194
this is precisely the kinds of signs
of life that we'll be seeking.

301
00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:54.156
These wrinkly layered structures
that we call stromatolites.

302
00:17:54.323 --> 00:17:58.077
which represent. basically.
fossilized pond scum. in a sense.

303
00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:01.705
This is what we would call
a bio-signature.

304
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.583
Sign of life. observable to the naked eye.

305
00:18:04.708 --> 00:18:08.087
and therefore. observable to say.
the mast-mounted cameras on a rover.

306
00:18:08.629 --> 00:18:11.548
If we see something like this
on Mars. it is a very. very good day.

307
00:18:11.632 --> 00:18:13.967
It would be
a very important scientific discovery.

308
00:18:14.093 --> 00:18:17.513
We would characterize it using
the instruments that are on the rover.

309
00:18:17.763 --> 00:18:21.141
And then we would sample it.
and prepare it for return to Earth.

310
00:18:24.853 --> 00:18:27.272
NARRATOR: Now it's up to the engineers
to make it happen.

311
00:18:27.815 --> 00:18:29.733
starting with Jezero Crater.

312
00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:33.320
The most dangerous place
they've ever attempted to land on Mars.

313
00:18:34.655 --> 00:18:36.156
AL: Landing on Mars
is always very difficult.

314
00:18:36.615 --> 00:18:39.034
I mean. the vehicle has to do
everything on its own. right?

315
00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:42.329
We have no ability to joystick
the spacecraft as it's coming in.

316
00:18:43.122 --> 00:18:45.249
But at Jezero Crater.
I see a lot of dangers

317
00:18:45.332 --> 00:18:48.085
that we have to deal with.
There are rock fields to the east.

318
00:18:48.752 --> 00:18:50.838
We need to avoid steep slopes as well.

319
00:18:51.255 --> 00:18:54.133
There's a 60 to 80-meter cliff
that we definitely don't want to land on.

320
00:18:54.216 --> 00:18:55.634
That would definitely be a bad day.

This critical piece of new technology.
for helping us land safely at Jezero.

327
00:19:20.367 --> 00:19:23.287
This gives the vehicle the ability
to figure out where it is.

328
00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:26.248
using a camera to take pictures
on the way down.

329
00:19:26.373 --> 00:19:28.917
and to compare the pictures to pictures
we've taken from orbiters.

330

kind of a map of the place
we're trying to go.

And then. we can use our engines
to steer the vehicle

because we know where we are finally.

334
00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:38.886
Everything still has to go right
for us to make it.

335
00:19:39.928 --> 00:19:42.097
You know. it's my job to be nervous
about everything.

336
00:19:42.264 --> 00:19:44.474
But. you know.
what we've been doing this week

337
00:19:44.558 --> 00:19:46.018
has given me a lot of confidence.

338
00:19:49.146 --> 00:19:51.565
NARRATOR: Landing on Mars
is never a sure thing.

339
00:19:51.982 --> 00:19:56.278
But it has been accomplished before
by some of these same JPL engineers.

340
00:19:58.155 --> 00:20:00.365
And apart from the new hazard
avoidance system.

341
00:20:00.616 --> 00:20:03.952
the descent stage is pretty much the same
as it was for curiosity.

342
00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:06.663
built by many of these same techs.

343
00:20:09.416 --> 00:20:11.460
The biggest risks on any mission

344
00:20:11.543 --> 00:20:14.213
are the things
that have never been done before.

345
00:20:15.005 --> 00:20:19.218
We want to bring samples
from Mars back to Earth.

346
00:20:20.302 --> 00:20:23.430
It takes three missions
to make that happen.

347
00:20:23.805 --> 00:20:26.975
One mission.
to core into the rocks of Mars.

348
00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:32.773
take core samples.
seal them in inhumanly clean vessels.

349
00:20:33.106 --> 00:20:35.651
and leave those vessels
on the surface of Mars.

350
00:20:36.068 --> 00:20:39.196
The second mission.
to take those sealed samples.

351
00:20:39.279 --> 00:20:42.449
put them in a small rocket.
and put them in orbit around Mars.

352
00:20:45.494 --> 00:20:48.205
The third mission.
to scoop them out of orbit.

353
00:20:48.288 --> 00:20:49.748
and bring them back to Earth.

354
00:20:50.832 --> 00:20:53.877
And our mission. Mars 2020.
is the first of those missions.

355
00:20:54.920 --> 00:21:00.259
I think that almost everybody
on this project shares my personal anxiety

356
00:21:00.425 --> 00:21:02.427
that it's that sampling system

357
00:21:02.678 --> 00:21:06.765
that is our greatest challenge
on this mission.

358
00:21:11.812 --> 00:21:13.772
I'm the Chief Engineer for the project.

359
00:21:14.314 --> 00:21:17.150
And I try to be able to span the range

360
00:21:17.276 --> 00:21:19.486
of all the different elements
of the spacecraft.

361
00:21:19.611 --> 00:21:24.324
and then find the holes
in our defense against mistakes

362
00:21:24.449 --> 00:21:26.410
and our defense against risk.

363
00:21:27.536 --> 00:21:31.915
Prior to having this job.
I developed the sampling system.

364
00:21:32.833 --> 00:21:36.712
This incredibly challenging
set of mechanisms that we use

365
00:21:36.962 --> 00:21:40.382
to core rocky samples.
and keep them clean.

366
00:21:40.465 --> 00:21:43.844
and move them through.
and process them. and collect them.

367
00:21:45.762 --> 00:21:52.436
We have a sample tube...
that sits inside this drill.

368
00:21:53.061 --> 00:21:55.314
The drill bit's put into a corer.

369
00:21:55.689 --> 00:21:58.400
and the corer goes...
(MIMICS DRILL WHIRRING)

370
00:21:59.109 --> 00:22:00.736
And as it does that.

371
00:22:00.819 --> 00:22:05.073
it shoves that column of rock
into the sample tube.

372
00:22:06.074 --> 00:22:09.244
We then. bring the sample tube out.

373
00:22:09.411 --> 00:22:11.496
We're doing this
with the sample handling arm

374
00:22:11.705 --> 00:22:13.498
on the inside of the spacecraft.

375
00:22:15.042 --> 00:22:19.713
And we move that tube...
to a station that assesses the volume.

376
00:22:19.796 --> 00:22:21.465
to a station that takes images.

377
00:22:21.631 --> 00:22:23.842
We put a seal on it...

378
00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:27.471
and then.
we put that tube back in storage.

379
00:22:28.055 --> 00:22:30.932
I got 43 of these tubes inside
the spacecraft.

380
00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:32.684
We can do that 43 times.

381
00:22:34.811 --> 00:22:38.190
A rocky core...
this is what it's all about.

382
00:22:38.482 --> 00:22:40.359
We want to bring a sample like this.

383
00:22:40.859 --> 00:22:45.822
We want to bring 30 samples like this
back from Mars.

384
00:22:47.574 --> 00:22:48.992
And so. we're putting our system together.

385
00:22:49.076 --> 00:22:51.453
this behemothly complicated thing.

386
00:22:52.287 --> 00:22:56.792
It outstrips the complexity of anything
that's been created by humans.

387
00:22:56.875 --> 00:22:58.668
and put into space. ever.

388
00:23:00.337 --> 00:23:01.588
KELLY:
This equipment is not going to Mars.

389
00:23:01.713 --> 00:23:04.174
This is our engineering model.
so it's built to be

390
00:23:04.257 --> 00:23:05.717
as flight-like as possible.

391
00:23:05.926 --> 00:23:07.469
with the same functionality
as everything in Mars.

392
00:23:08.678 --> 00:23:10.389
So.
we're in a very dirty environment here.

393
00:23:10.472 --> 00:23:13.558
and we're gonna drill rocks with it.
we're going to cover it in dust.

394
00:23:13.642 --> 00:23:16.144
and really run it through its paces.
and wear it out.

395
00:23:16.311 --> 00:23:18.021
That a pretty good-looking core.

396
00:23:18.438 --> 00:23:20.690
NARRATOR: This dirty testing version
of the hardware

397
00:23:20.774 --> 00:23:23.068
will take a beating
over the next few years.

398
00:23:23.318 --> 00:23:25.737
Eventually moving
to a space simulation chamber

399
00:23:25.821 --> 00:23:29.658
to prove it can function in the frigid.
low pressure environment of Mars.

400
00:23:36.164 --> 00:23:39.376
Two flight versions.
one of which will actually go to Mars.

401
00:23:39.584 --> 00:23:42.629
are still being built at this point.
under very different conditions.

402
00:23:43.839 --> 00:23:47.509
WILLIFORD: One of our key concerns
with Mars 2020 is keeping it clean.

403
00:23:48.009 --> 00:23:52.222
So. we're going to Mars.
we're spending a lot of resources

404
00:23:52.347 --> 00:23:53.682
to collect these samples.

405
00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:56.685
We don't wanna be analyzing bits of Earth.

406
00:23:58.478 --> 00:24:01.189
NARRATOR: On a good day.
the air outside JPL.

407
00:24:01.314 --> 00:24:04.526
just north of Los Angeles.
is a soup of hydrocarbons.

408
00:24:04.609 --> 00:24:08.071
and millions of microscopic particles
in every cubic foot of air.

409
00:24:09.072 --> 00:24:11.950
On a bad day. it can be
in the hundreds of millions.

410
00:24:14.828 --> 00:24:17.122
The spacecraft clean room is filtered
to no more

411
00:24:17.247 --> 00:24:20.625
than 10.000 microscopic particles
per cubic foot.

412
00:24:22.043 --> 00:24:24.588
The ultraclean rooms.
where the flight sampling hardware

413
00:24:24.671 --> 00:24:27.674
is built. have no more
than one hundred per cubic foot.

414
00:24:29.676 --> 00:24:33.305
LACK: About two and a half years ago.
they came to me and said.

415
00:24:33.972 --> 00:24:36.475
"We need to set up
some clean rooms that could handle

416
00:24:36.558 --> 00:24:37.934
"this cleanliness level.

417
00:24:38.101 --> 00:24:40.562
"It's something that we've never done
here at JPL before.

418
00:24:40.687 --> 00:24:42.230
"and we don't know how to do it."

419
00:24:43.732 --> 00:24:46.193
Everything inside the clean room
had to be brand new.

420
00:24:46.318 --> 00:24:51.198
which means brand-new flow wrenches.
brand new toolboxes. with brand-new tools.

421
00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:54.951
All the computer systems
are brand new. Everything.

422
00:24:55.076 --> 00:24:58.497
Right out of the box.
and born into the clean room.

423
00:24:58.872 --> 00:25:01.875
It took a year for me
to get them up and running.

424
00:25:02.209 --> 00:25:06.421
No... no joke. It took a year.
(CHUCKLES) It was... it was crazy.

425
00:25:07.547 --> 00:25:10.133
ADAM: The technicians
have been part of the team

426
00:25:10.217 --> 00:25:13.470
from the get-go.
sort of. authored this approach.

427
00:25:14.012 --> 00:25:16.348
and verified that we could
actually pull it off.

428
00:25:17.641 --> 00:25:20.143
NARRATOR: The rules
for the ultraclean rooms go way beyond

429
00:25:20.227 --> 00:25:23.063
what's required in any other cleanrooms
at JPL.

430
00:25:25.065 --> 00:25:28.109
They start with the same gloves. masks.
and bunny suits.

431
00:25:29.236 --> 00:25:31.571
There's the same air shower on the way in.

432
00:25:32.781 --> 00:25:35.867
But in these ultraclean rooms.
that's just the beginning.

433
00:25:37.619 --> 00:25:40.205
BRIANNA: I work with the bits
and corer team.

434
00:25:40.372 --> 00:25:43.250
and these needs to capture
what's coming from Mars.

435
00:25:43.333 --> 00:25:44.626
not what's coming from Earth.

436
00:25:44.709 --> 00:25:47.337
So. we have to take
extraordinary measures.

437
00:25:48.046 --> 00:25:50.799
JIM: I've got technicians
over in the ultraclean rooms

438
00:25:50.924 --> 00:25:54.719
that are wearing
double bunny suits. double gloves.

439
00:25:55.428 --> 00:25:57.097
JENNA: Anything that can produce
a particle

440
00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:00.183
that can cause contamination
is not allowed.

441
00:26:00.892 --> 00:26:03.228
No scented shampoo or conditioner.
no perfume.

442
00:26:03.311 --> 00:26:05.814
no cologne. no makeup.
things like that.

443
00:26:06.815 --> 00:26:09.276
BRIANNA: The rule is.
if we smell you before you go in.

444
00:26:09.401 --> 00:26:11.152
you... you can't come in.

445
00:26:11.528 --> 00:26:14.406
You can't smoke.
Oh. few people needed to quit that.

446
00:26:15.198 --> 00:26:18.368
SETH: Yeah. it kind of became
like JPL urban mythology

447
00:26:18.451 --> 00:26:21.246
double bunny suiting
and all stainless steel tools.

448
00:26:21.371 --> 00:26:23.540
You'd hear these incredible
things they were doing.

449
00:26:23.623 --> 00:26:25.584
kind of on the bleeding edge
of technology.

450
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:30.422
JAMES: We rarely see them.
They're almost the ghosts of lab.

451
00:26:31.006 --> 00:26:32.924
I honestly don't even know what to expect.

452
00:26:36.219 --> 00:26:38.930
(RATTLING)

453
00:26:39.598 --> 00:26:42.392
THORA: We are working on something
that is the cleanest

454
00:26:42.475 --> 00:26:44.978
we've ever really attempted
to send into space.

455
00:26:45.729 --> 00:26:46.938
So. we've had to rethink.

456
00:26:47.105 --> 00:26:51.318
how do we do this as cleanly as possible.
and keep all those particles off the rest

457
00:26:51.401 --> 00:26:52.861
of the surface of the flight hardware?

458
00:26:54.154 --> 00:26:56.781
NARRATOR: Cleanest of all
are the titanium sample tubes

459
00:26:56.948 --> 00:27:00.035
that will preserve Martian rock cores
from the moment they're drilled

460
00:27:00.118 --> 00:27:01.578
until they return to Earth.

461
00:27:03.538 --> 00:27:07.584
By the time they go to Mars.
they'll be the cleanest things ever made.

462
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:10.962
That is not hyperbole.

463
00:27:11.713 --> 00:27:14.341
Literally. cleaner than anything
humans have ever made.

464
00:27:15.717 --> 00:27:18.970
NARRATOR: Even gloved hands
can't touch the tubes during cleaning.

465
00:27:19.387 --> 00:27:23.058
In hands-free cages. they'll go through
a barrage of chemical solvents.

466
00:27:25.977 --> 00:27:28.688
They've been through
a complex manufacturing process.

467
00:27:29.064 --> 00:27:34.402
Machining. polishing. special coatings.
often sterilized between steps.

468
00:27:36.196 --> 00:27:39.282
And now. before they go
to the techs for mechanical assembly.

469
00:27:39.449 --> 00:27:40.867
they're cleaned again.

470
00:27:42.202 --> 00:27:46.247
Multiple soaks in solvent tanks agitated
with high frequency sound.

471
00:27:46.373 --> 00:27:48.833
strip away more particles and organics.

472
00:27:50.168 --> 00:27:52.629
THORA: No particle's thicker
than a strand of hair.

473
00:27:53.088 --> 00:27:55.507
A fingerprint can weigh
around 50 micrograms.

474
00:27:55.632 --> 00:27:58.218
We are trying
to hit less than point one micrograms

475
00:27:58.343 --> 00:27:59.636
for organic contaminations.

476
00:28:01.179 --> 00:28:03.765
NARRATOR: Then. they get baked
in a high temperature oven

477
00:28:03.848 --> 00:28:05.392
to burn off whatever is left.

478
00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:10.480
They're building 200 of these tubes.

479
00:28:10.939 --> 00:28:14.651
In the end. 43 of the most pristine
will go to Mars.

480
00:28:16.069 --> 00:28:17.946
In the meantime.
the technicians have to add

481
00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:20.740
mechanical parts
without contaminating them.

482
00:28:22.409 --> 00:28:24.786
That happens in an even cleaner room.

483
00:28:25.203 --> 00:28:27.247
with sterile gloves. sterile smocks.

484
00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:29.833
and sterile goggles on top
of everything else.

485
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.294
They call it Area 151.

486
00:28:36.005 --> 00:28:37.298
-FEMALE ENGINEER: You ready?
-MALE ENGINEER: Yeah.

487
00:28:37.382 --> 00:28:38.550
FEMALE ENGINEER: You can go in now.

488
00:28:45.181 --> 00:28:48.560
ADAM: To put all of these very.
very clean elements together.

489
00:28:48.977 --> 00:28:50.854
is a tremendous amount of handwork.

490
00:28:51.312 --> 00:28:54.399
And you have to do it in these very.
very clean environments

491
00:28:54.524 --> 00:28:57.485
using aseptic assembly protocols.

492
00:28:57.819 --> 00:28:59.362
You're not touching a lot of surfaces.

493
00:28:59.446 --> 00:29:02.282
you want your hands to be sterile.
you want your tools to be sterile.

494
00:29:02.824 --> 00:29:05.493
It's required
all of our flight technicians

495
00:29:05.577 --> 00:29:08.830
to retrain their minds
about how they build the flight hardware.

496
00:29:09.497 --> 00:29:12.208
JENNA: You have to be very.
very conscious of your hands.

497

of the people with touch labor
on the hardware

501
00:29:29.267 --> 00:29:31.853

506
00:29:43.698 --> 00:29:47.452
was that there were enough piece parts.
enough special things.

been assembled.

518
00:30:41.005 --> 00:30:44.384
we'll roll it through the high bay here.
and load it into the chamber.

519
00:30:44.968 --> 00:30:47.762

PATRICK: I think some of the engineers
at the beginning of this would have said.

662
00:39:10.306 --> 00:39:12.350
"You can't achieve this kinda precision
by hand.

663
00:39:12.433 --> 00:39:16.062
"Starting from a really small hole.
making it a little bigger each time."

664
00:39:16.145 --> 00:39:19.231
But now we can hit hole after hole
to that level of precision.

665
00:39:25.404 --> 00:39:27.990
NARRATOR: A few days later.
they're installing the electric drive

666
00:39:28.115 --> 00:39:30.242
and steering motors
into the suspension struts

667
00:39:30.326 --> 00:39:31.952
where they'll be mounting the wheels.

668
00:39:37.041 --> 00:39:39.794
It's some of the most critical hardware
on the rover

669
00:39:39.877 --> 00:39:42.296
and some of the trickiest to handle.

670
00:39:43.798 --> 00:39:47.551
These actuators have to be rugged enough
to work for years on Mars.

671
00:39:47.676 --> 00:39:51.389
at temperatures that can swing
100 degrees in a single day.

672
00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:55.267
But they're vulnerable in human hands.

673
00:39:58.562 --> 00:40:00.231
The rover has ten of them.

674
00:40:00.689 --> 00:40:04.860
It took years to build and perfect 12.
giving them two spares.

675
00:40:05.152 --> 00:40:08.656
That makes them worth
about one million dollars apiece.

676
00:40:10.741 --> 00:40:16.831
PASAN: It's definitely a moment
where you need to be extremely focused.

677
00:40:17.248 --> 00:40:18.624
There's no room for error.

678
00:40:18.874 --> 00:40:20.918
You kind of have to drown
everything else out

679
00:40:21.001 --> 00:40:23.170
and at the same time. not be afraid.

680
00:40:25.256 --> 00:40:27.758
PATRICK: You know. we're at a phase now
where the stakes are really high.

681
00:40:27.883 --> 00:40:31.429
and it's not so much
about. like. monetary value of something.

682
00:40:31.512 --> 00:40:34.723
It's really about irrecoverable schedule
at this point.

683
00:40:35.641 --> 00:40:38.602
We're looking at years and years
of another team's work.

684
00:40:38.811 --> 00:40:40.771
and now it's our responsibility

685
00:40:40.855 --> 00:40:43.399
to see it safely
on to its next destination.

00:41:27.359 --> 00:41:29.111
They have 43 altogether.

695
00:41:30.196 --> 00:41:31.947
Only six will go to Mars.

696
00:41:32.573 --> 00:41:36.452
The rest will stay behind as spares
for the test rovers in the Mars Yard.

00:41:46.879 --> 00:41:50.007
they're in the hands of the mobility team
for the first time.

700
00:42:00.851 --> 00:42:03.229
PATRICK: This stuff looks beautiful

701
00:42:03.812 --> 00:42:06.482
because it's a product
of functional design

702
00:42:06.815 --> 00:42:09.109
kind of being taken to the nth degree.

703
00:42:10.444 --> 00:42:13.239
I find that complex designs
are usually complex

704
00:42:13.405 --> 00:42:14.657
because they haven't had enough time

705
00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:16.951
to cook and distill down
to something elegant.

-MALE TECH 2: Ta-da!

708
00:42:32.925 --> 00:42:35.177
PATRICK: You know. it feels
really high pressure now.

709
00:42:36.428 --> 00:42:38.347
because it's not a few different
piece parts

710
00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:39.932
in different people's hands.

711
00:42:42.726 --> 00:42:44.603
You know. it's one big installation.

712
00:42:45.688 --> 00:42:48.023
So. we feel a great sense
of responsibility. I think.

713
00:42:48.274 --> 00:42:51.360
to really not mess it up
in these final stages.

714
00:42:57.449 --> 00:43:00.327
NARRATOR: A few days later.
the rover mobility system

715
00:43:00.411 --> 00:43:03.038

say goodbye to hardware

for the past three or four years

You run into it when you build
your first piece of spaceflight hardware.

728
00:43:42.911 --> 00:43:43.954
and you...

729
00:43:44.872 --> 00:43:47.499
go to deliver it
to the rest of the spacecraft.

730
00:43:47.666 --> 00:43:51.795

As soon as you hand it over to them.

So. it's no longer their responsibility.

Now. we control it.

738
00:44:09.772 --> 00:44:11.690
and we will be the ones
to put it on the spacecraft.

739
00:44:12.024 --> 00:44:14.485
We'll take care of this.
we'll get it inside with QA.

740
00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:16.070
and then we'll section it all off.

745
00:44:36.423 --> 00:44:39.635
then it kind of becomes possessed
by this group of people.

746
00:44:40.386 --> 00:44:42.805

of the elements of the spacecraft
that come into them.

748
00:44:46.392 --> 00:44:47.726
And I think that that's...

749
00:44:48.894 --> 00:44:50.979
the perfect perspective for them to have.

750
00:44:51.355 --> 00:44:54.024
because once they have those pieces
of spaceflight hardware...

751
00:44:54.858 --> 00:44:57.903
it's all in their hands.
Literally in their hands.

If you make mistakes at that point.
they can be very. very. very costly.

into the vertical vacuum chamber.

993
00:59:41.786 --> 00:59:45.081
Once sealed inside.
the system will have to prove itself.

994
00:59:45.164 --> 00:59:48.251
repeatedly drilling cores
and handling samples

995
00:59:48.334 --> 00:59:52.005
exactly as it will happen on the frigid.
airless surface of Mars.

996
00:59:55.133 --> 00:59:58.303
And the first attempt does not go well.

997
01:00:01.889 --> 01:00:06.769
ADAM: The very first time
we went up the hill to our vacuum chamber

998
01:00:06.978 --> 01:00:11.733
that allows us to core in the conditions
that we expect to see on Mars.

999
01:00:13.067 --> 01:00:15.320
The very first tube
we put into the coring bit.

1000
01:00:15.486 --> 01:00:18.239
we put that bit. We took a corer...
(MIMICS DRILL WHIRRING)

1001
01:00:18.406 --> 01:00:21.909
We broke it off. Click.
We brought it back into the rover.

1002
01:00:22.201 --> 01:00:25.038
We took our little sample handling arm.
reached up.

1003
01:00:25.413 --> 01:00:27.123
and went to pull out the tube...

1004
01:00:28.166 --> 01:00:30.752
and the tube was stuck inside the bit.

1005
01:00:31.711 --> 01:00:33.796
We're now calling that Excalibur.

1006
01:00:34.172 --> 01:00:37.759
The sword is stuck in the stone.
The tube is stuck in the bit.

1007
01:00:38.217 --> 01:00:39.969
What's the significance of that?

1008
01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:44.474
Well. that means that if we can't get
that tube out of the bit.

1009
01:00:44.599 --> 01:00:46.726
this bit is no longer of any use to us.

1010
01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:49.228
We have six of these bits all in.

1011
01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:52.607
So. we could stick a tube
in a bit six times

1012
01:00:52.732 --> 01:00:54.984
before it would be game over
for taking corers.

1013
01:00:56.527 --> 01:00:58.905
We start to look in detail
at some of the mechanisms

1014
01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:00.365
that could be involved.

1015
01:01:01.407 --> 01:01:03.493
There is another set of tubes
that have gone through

1016
01:01:03.576 --> 01:01:05.995
our final flight cleaning process.

1017
01:01:06.954 --> 01:01:08.998
We're starting to exercise those tubes.

1018
01:01:09.082 --> 01:01:11.834
not in the dirty testing.
but in another vacuum chamber.

1019
01:01:13.378 --> 01:01:16.297
And there we see things
that don't look that great.

1020
01:01:16.923 --> 01:01:19.801
Those mechanisms
are showing us stickiness

1021
01:01:20.093 --> 01:01:23.971
that's very close to locking
the mechanism up and making it unusable.

1022
01:01:25.014 --> 01:01:27.266
And some of them. if they failed...

1023
01:01:28.601 --> 01:01:30.144
essentially the mission is over.

1024
01:01:34.023 --> 01:01:36.275
NARRATOR: That stickiness. friction.

1025
01:01:36.651 --> 01:01:40.405
turns out to be an unintended consequence
of the extreme cleaning regimen

1026
01:01:40.571 --> 01:01:42.907
the tubes and their mechanisms
have gone through

1027
01:01:43.408 --> 01:01:46.661
to prevent them from contaminating samples
collected on Mars.

1028
01:01:49.163 --> 01:01:51.708
Powerful solvents
and a high temperature bake out

1029
01:01:51.833 --> 01:01:54.001
drove off every trace of hydrocarbons...

1030
01:01:55.002 --> 01:01:59.841
including a microscopic layer that remains
on conventionally sterilized surfaces.

1031
01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:03.511
Interesting thing.

1032
01:02:04.095 --> 01:02:07.515
Our engineers... do tests about friction.

1033
01:02:07.598 --> 01:02:12.019
understand how to design mechanisms
based entirely on data...

1034
01:02:12.979 --> 01:02:16.399
of materials that have that thin layer
of the hydrocarbons on them.

1035
01:02:17.275 --> 01:02:23.781
No mechanisms. no devices.
no robots have ever been made

1036
01:02:23.865 --> 01:02:25.908
or conceived of to be this clean.

1037
01:02:26.242 --> 01:02:28.911
So. all of our understanding
about friction.

1038
01:02:28.995 --> 01:02:31.831
about ways metals mate and don't mate.

1039
01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:36.753
is all based on metals that have
this very thin coating of hydrocarbons.

1040
01:02:37.795 --> 01:02:40.465
This isn't an issue of workmanship.

1041
01:02:40.673 --> 01:02:44.969
It is really an issue
of creating mechanisms

1042
01:02:45.219 --> 01:02:49.724
that are unearthly in their cleanliness
and their function

1043
01:02:49.974 --> 01:02:53.311
is changed by that unearthly cleanliness.

1044
01:02:53.853 --> 01:02:56.063
Reasonably. we should have expected that.

1045
01:02:56.189 --> 01:02:59.859
But we didn't really have
a finished flight design

1046
01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:04.155
to put through those tests four years ago
when we committed to this.

1047
01:03:04.489 --> 01:03:06.699
And so now.
it's only now when we're done

1048
01:03:07.158 --> 01:03:08.951
that we put it through the tests
and we're like.

1049
01:03:09.035 --> 01:03:10.536
"Well. there's some problems here."

1050
01:03:11.704 --> 01:03:12.955
NARRATOR: The question now is.

1051
01:03:13.039 --> 01:03:16.626
can the hardware be made reliable enough
to launch in July 2020.

1052
01:03:16.876 --> 01:03:18.169
just eight months away?

1053
01:03:19.003 --> 01:03:20.671
Or should they buy more time

1054
01:03:20.755 --> 01:03:23.966
and slip launch the next opportunity
in 2022?

1055
01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:25.968
(RATTLING)

1056
01:03:26.052 --> 01:03:28.888
What is good enough. right? We...

1057
01:03:31.599 --> 01:03:33.267
None of us really know.

1058
01:03:33.851 --> 01:03:36.687
My previous experience
has been landing.

1059
01:03:37.188 --> 01:03:39.023
Landing's very binary.

1060
01:03:39.357 --> 01:03:41.692
Good enough is safely landing the vehicle.

1061
01:03:41.776 --> 01:03:42.944
(ALL CHEERING)

1062
01:03:43.402 --> 01:03:44.445
Done.

1063
01:03:47.782 --> 01:03:50.910
If our sampling system successfully
gets 30 samples

1064
01:03:50.993 --> 01:03:53.412
and then fails. well. okay.
that's good enough.

1065
01:03:54.747 --> 01:03:55.790
Twenty?

1066
01:03:57.124 --> 01:03:59.252
Maybe that's good enough. Ten?

1067
01:04:00.419 --> 01:04:01.587
Not good enough.

1068
01:04:04.173 --> 01:04:05.967
NARRATOR: To miss the launch deadline.

1069
01:04:06.217 --> 01:04:08.636
putting everything on hold for 26 months.

1070
01:04:09.011 --> 01:04:11.973
would cost
at least five hundred million dollars

1071
01:04:12.223 --> 01:04:15.059
and complicate planning
for the sample return mission.

1072
01:04:15.935 --> 01:04:19.272
But launching on schedule
and failing to collect enough samples

1073
01:04:19.397 --> 01:04:20.523
would be worse.

1074
01:04:22.358 --> 01:04:24.694
ADAM: Because this sampling mission
is the first

1075
01:04:24.777 --> 01:04:27.280
in a three-mission program

1076
01:04:27.905 --> 01:04:29.824
spanning over a decade.

1077
01:04:30.199 --> 01:04:34.370
resulting in samples from Mars
being returned to Earth.

1078
01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:38.082
some of our sampling system mechanisms.
if they failed.

1079
01:04:38.332 --> 01:04:40.626
could not only kill this mission.

1080
01:04:41.127 --> 01:04:45.756
they kill the follow up missions.
The stakes are kind of unbelievably high.

1081
01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:49.343
NARRATOR: By mid-February.
six weeks away.

1082
01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.762
they have to decide
whether to move the spacecraft

1083
01:04:51.971 --> 01:04:53.723
to Florida and prepare for launch...

1084
01:04:54.599 --> 01:04:56.475
or punt to 2022.

1085
01:04:57.643 --> 01:05:00.479
Between now and then.
the project will focus on getting

1086
01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:02.565
the evidence they need
to make that decision.

1087
01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:05.067
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

1088
01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:07.111
ADAM: We launch in July.

1089
01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:10.865
We're December. we won't be done
with this assessment in January.

1090
01:05:11.073 --> 01:05:13.826
We won't be done
with this assessment in February.

1091
01:05:14.243 --> 01:05:16.787
But you don't wanna pack the thing up
and ship it to the Cape

1092
01:05:16.871 --> 01:05:18.956
if you're not gonna then launch it.

1093
01:05:24.503 --> 01:05:27.924
NARRATOR: It's not unusual
for Mars missions to flirt with disaster.

1094
01:05:28.299 --> 01:05:30.217
In fact. it's almost routine.

1095
01:05:30.718 --> 01:05:33.763
Since each new mission
is trying to do something

1096
01:05:34.055 --> 01:05:35.765
that hasn't been done before.

1097
01:05:37.099 --> 01:05:40.519
ADAM: There is an escalation
there due to the arms race

1098
01:05:40.728 --> 01:05:45.399
between exploration technology
and that which demands to be explored.

1099
01:05:46.442 --> 01:05:51.781
I mean. this is so much more
incredibly intense than Curiosity.

1100
01:05:52.031 --> 01:05:56.118
which slipped because it was
so much more incredibly intense

1101
01:05:56.535 --> 01:05:57.912
than Spirit and Opportunity.

1102
01:05:58.079 --> 01:06:00.790
which were... I mean. each time. right.
our ambitions.

1103
01:06:00.915 --> 01:06:03.501
we step up to a bigger plate.

1104
01:06:04.126 --> 01:06:07.213
We take a swing at it
and we come very close to not making it.

1105
01:06:10.508 --> 01:06:13.260
I think that that's good in some regards.

1106
01:06:13.344 --> 01:06:15.513
I believe that one of the things
that we're doing here

1107
01:06:15.596 --> 01:06:19.600
is performance art
in The Art of the Possible.

1108
01:06:19.684 --> 01:06:22.311
We're asked... this lab is a place
where we do things

1109
01:06:22.395 --> 01:06:24.397
that people don't think can be done.

1110
01:06:24.730 --> 01:06:29.068
But that means you're very close
to doing something that can't be done!

1111
01:06:31.570 --> 01:06:33.322
NARRATOR: To understand
what they're up against.

1112
01:06:33.572 --> 01:06:35.241
they'll need
all the sample system hardware

1113
01:06:35.324 --> 01:06:36.534
for new testing.

1114
01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:41.455
So. the version installed in the rover
a few months ago is coming out.

1115
01:06:43.541 --> 01:06:45.835
The other flight unit.
the one that's been struggling

1116
01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:48.713
in the clean vacuum chamber.
is also coming out.

1117
01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:52.049
Both are headed back
to the ultraclean room

1118
01:06:52.133 --> 01:06:55.094
while the team comes up
with a plan to save the mission.

1119
01:06:58.597 --> 01:07:00.224
The rover is ready to go.

1120
01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:05.438
It survived the Space Simulator
and passed its first driving test.

1121
01:07:07.898 --> 01:07:09.358

-MALE VOICE: It's moving!
-FEMALE VOICE 1: Oh. my gosh!

1123
01:07:13.446 --> 01:07:15.948
NARRATOR: The JPL crew
is preparing to take it to Florida

1124
01:07:16.032 --> 01:07:17.783
for the final push to launch.

1125
01:07:20.619 --> 01:07:24.623
But with the sampling system in trouble
and the launch deadline in jeopardy.

1126
01:07:24.790 --> 01:07:27.251
no one really knows
what's going to happen next.

1127
01:07:29.545 --> 01:07:32.381
SETH: At this point.
usually the guts of the rover are set.

1128
01:07:33.174 --> 01:07:35.051
Once it's closed up.
this is where everything is gonna live

1129
01:07:35.134 --> 01:07:36.302
and it's not like that anymore.

1130
01:07:37.803 --> 01:07:40.431
There's always kind of a straggler.
there's always a problem and like.

1131
01:07:40.514 --> 01:07:42.308
"Oh. we'll deal with it in Florida."

1132
01:07:42.391 --> 01:07:43.809
but not on this scale.

1133
01:07:45.019 --> 01:07:46.771
ADAM: It has not been easy.

1134
01:07:47.605 --> 01:07:50.483
I've never felt as much uncertainty.

1135
01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:53.235
But we haven't played all the cards yet.

1136
01:08:00.951 --> 01:08:04.580
NARRATOR: The Perseverance rover.
the spacecraft that takes it to Mars.

1137
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:06.665
and the team that put it all together.

1138
01:08:06.874 --> 01:08:09.376
are supposed to move to Florida
in just about a month

1139
01:08:09.502 --> 01:08:11.462
to prepare for launch in July.

1140
01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:17.051
The primary mission
is to drill Martian rock cores.

1141
01:08:17.301 --> 01:08:18.969
cache them in sterile tubes.

1142
01:08:19.136 --> 01:08:21.305
and leave them on Mars
for a future mission

1143
01:08:21.388 --> 01:08:23.432
to pick up and return to Earth.

1144
01:08:24.683 --> 01:08:28.395
The rover and the rest of the spacecraft
have been tested. proven.

1145
01:08:28.521 --> 01:08:29.814
and are ready to go.

1146
01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:36.445
But problems with the rover's
crucial sample handling system

1147
01:08:36.570 --> 01:08:40.074
have forced a last minute scramble
to meet the launch deadline.

1148
01:08:41.659 --> 01:08:46.997
We'd been working on this for a long time
and we followed every protocol.

1149
01:08:47.081 --> 01:08:50.334
We did everything
that had been outlined for us to do.

1150
01:08:51.043 --> 01:08:54.755
But a lot of people were worried
that when we got to Mars

1151
01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:58.384
something would get stuck.
and mission over.

1152
01:08:58.467 --> 01:09:00.803
and we wouldn't be able
to take any samples.

1153
01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:04.723
So. they decided that we needed
to take a step back

1154
01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:07.059
and try to figure out what we're doing.

1155
01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:09.812
ADAM: We are in the middle
of a suite of testing.

1156

in the Space Simulator
under Mars' conditions.

1168
01:09:48.058 --> 01:09:50.644
the sample tube got stuck in the bit.

1169
01:09:52.438 --> 01:09:54.356
They called it Excalibur.

1170
01:09:54.773 --> 01:09:58.110
Since then. they've learned
that's not their biggest problem.

1171
01:09:58.527 --> 01:10:00.237
ADAM: So. we have that Excalibur
that got stuck.

1172
01:10:00.321 --> 01:10:03.282
and the analysis suggests
we've got a piece of dirt

1173
01:10:03.365 --> 01:10:06.368
or debris just in an awkward position.

1174
01:10:06.577 --> 01:10:09.997
We've continued to successfully
take cores in dirty testing.

we're not gonna kick all of the butts.

We are really working the system
very hard.

1227
01:13:06.673 --> 01:13:08.717
The big thing that we've struggled with

1228
01:13:08.842 --> 01:13:12.513
over the last three months
has been our sampling tubes.

1229
01:13:12.805 --> 01:13:15.391
You know. the sample tubes
go into the bits...

1230
01:13:15.474 --> 01:13:18.018
-(CLINKING)
-...inside the be... the beast.

1231
01:13:18.519 --> 01:13:21.688
Getting them in the bits.
we really struggled with.

1232
01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:25.275
and we really struggled with it
because of friction.

1233
01:13:25.609 --> 01:13:27.361
And because when we make these...

1234
01:13:28.278 --> 01:13:30.531
items unearthly clean.

1235
01:13:31.281 --> 01:13:35.285
the friction that arises
between these metals is much stickier.

1236
01:13:36.370 --> 01:13:41.041
So. our strategy has been to change
the way we clean these tubes.

1237
01:13:41.208 --> 01:13:43.836
We're only doing the unearthly clean

1238
01:13:44.044 --> 01:13:47.256
on the piece of the sample tube
that matters.

1239
01:13:47.506 --> 01:13:49.299
where the sample will come in contact.

1240
01:13:51.343 --> 01:13:53.679
NARRATOR: The tubes get another barrage
of solvent bath

1241
01:13:53.762 --> 01:13:55.139
like they got before.

1242
01:13:58.976 --> 01:14:02.396
But now. there's a final rinse
with another solvent called hexane...

1243
01:14:03.397 --> 01:14:06.650
carefully applied just to the parts
of the tube that would come in contact

1244
01:14:06.775 --> 01:14:08.318
with the sample on Mars.

1245
01:14:12.364 --> 01:14:16.201
All this makes it possible to do
the final bake out at a lower temperature.

1246
01:14:16.368 --> 01:14:19.288
making things a bit less clean
to reduce the friction

1247
01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:21.665
but still clean enough
to protect the samples.

1248
01:14:25.878 --> 01:14:29.631
We were driving the cleanliness
of the mechanism piece

1249
01:14:30.007 --> 01:14:33.343
to as clean as the sample.
the part that the sample has to go into.

1250
01:14:34.052 --> 01:14:39.099
And now we are letting this be. still.
cleanest thing that ever goes into space.

1251
01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:43.020
But only the business end
of the sample tube

1252
01:14:43.187 --> 01:14:45.689
gets this final set of solvent rinses

1253
01:14:45.856 --> 01:14:49.234
which takes it to that unearthly...
level of cleanliness.

1254
01:14:49.693 --> 01:14:50.694
That's helped.

1255
01:14:51.236 --> 01:14:54.781
Second thing we've done
is done a lot of practice

1256
01:14:54.865 --> 01:14:57.743
of getting these... these tubes
into bits

1257
01:14:57.868 --> 01:15:00.621
and discovered methods
with our little robot arm

1258
01:15:00.871 --> 01:15:04.666
inside the vehicle to be successful
even in the presence

1259
01:15:04.791 --> 01:15:07.669
of these higher frictions
than we've hoped for.

1260
01:15:09.004 --> 01:15:10.047
Okay.

1261
01:15:10.881 --> 01:15:11.924
Sweet.

01:15:12.549 --> 01:15:14.927
ADAM: And when we do that. it works.

1263
01:15:15.719 --> 01:15:18.889
So. I think we'll be
probably more successful

1264
01:15:19.306 --> 01:15:21.350
because of our...

1265
01:15:22.184 --> 01:15:25.604
challenges than we would have been
if we hadn't had them.

1266
01:15:26.188 --> 01:15:31.860
We've kind of emerged out the other side
with a deeper understanding

1267
01:15:31.944 --> 01:15:34.905
of the complexities of this thing
that we created.

1268
01:15:35.239 --> 01:15:37.574
Some of which we love.
and some of which we hate...

1269
01:15:38.742 --> 01:15:41.078
but all of which we think we can fly.

1270
01:15:41.328 --> 01:15:44.289
All of which we think
will be successful at Mars.

1271
01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:54.967

everything that they came up with

1272
01:15:55.050 --> 01:15:56.802
has worked pretty well.

And here we are. We're a little late
but we're still gonna make it.

have had their final cleaning.

1275

that transfers bits to the drill.

1276
01:16:07.104 --> 01:16:10.357

1278
01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:17.239
NARRATOR: They have to be kept
as clean as the tubes.

1279
01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:20.284

1281
01:16:25.581 --> 01:16:29.626
Even so. there's no way to eliminate
all hydrocarbons in the air.

1282

Those signatures of life are slowly
but steadily coating the hardware.

1283
01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:38.260
So. the action is choreographed
to unfold as quickly.

1284

01:17:25.015 --> 01:17:26.683
the best-looking sample tubes.

1303
01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:31.647
A part of our inspection
is baroscopic microscopy down

1304
01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:35.692
into the bore to make sure we've looked
at every single speck.

1305
01:17:35.901 --> 01:17:40.197
fleck. slight reflection.
then clean 'em again.

1306
01:17:41.531 --> 01:17:46.078
We put our sterile flight tubes
in special sheaths.

1307
01:17:46.453 --> 01:17:50.248
and then that assembly goes
into a bake out for sterilization.

1308
01:17:50.457 --> 01:17:52.751
and it's inserted in the flight vehicle...
