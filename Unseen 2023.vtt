00:01:12.985 --> 00:01:14.683
<i>Hi. babe.</i>

4
00:01:14.813 --> 00:01:17.338
Dinner's almost ready.

5
00:01:17.468 --> 00:01:19.253
Wha... What...

6
00:01:19.383 --> 00:01:21.298
Where... Where am I?

7
00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:23.083
How did I get here?
Where's... my phone?

8
00:01:23.213 --> 00:01:25.650
Where's my phone?
Where are my glasses?

9
00:01:25.781 --> 00:01:26.956
Shh. shh. shh.

10
00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:28.914
Hey. hey. hey. hey. hey.
Calm down.

11
00:01:51.502 --> 00:01:53.287
Hi. Isaac.
You're late.

12
00:01:53.417 --> 00:01:55.245
And you broke the
Freezy machine.

13
00:01:55.376 --> 00:01:57.247
It's on the fritz!

14
00:02:00.337 --> 00:02:02.426
I haven't touched it.
Yeah. you did.

15
00:02:02.557 --> 00:02:04.559
If you hadn't. it wouldn't be
on the fritz. now. would it?

16
00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.604
Okay. I'll take a look.

17
00:02:06.735 --> 00:02:09.085
Hey.

18
00:02:09.216 --> 00:02:12.567
Let's checky-check that
gloomy mug at the door. huh?

19
00:02:12.697 --> 00:02:14.699
Better not be greeting
my customers

20
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.571
with that sad-sack shit.

21
00:02:19.791 --> 00:02:23.230
You smell like... failure.

22
00:02:28.713 --> 00:02:30.585
After you're done
with the Freezy machine.

23
00:02:30.715 --> 00:02:32.891
clean up whatever happened
in the bathroom. okay?

24
00:02:33.022 --> 00:02:34.676
Devereaux!

25
00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:37.853
I'm watching you.

26
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.301
[man] I'm sorry.

27
00:02:51.432 --> 00:02:52.694
I'm sorry. sorry.
Hold on.

28
00:02:52.824 --> 00:02:54.435
Shh. It's okay.
It's okay. Shh.

29
00:02:54.565 --> 00:02:56.001
Hold on.

30
00:02:57.351 --> 00:02:59.483
Ch-Charlie? Charlie?

31
00:02:59.614 --> 00:03:01.355

Charlie. what are you
even trying to do?

58
00:04:09.771 --> 00:04:13.644
I decided to forgive you
for humiliating me.

59
00:04:13.775 --> 00:04:15.429
Breaking up with me days after

60
00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:17.605
my father threw me
off the board was

61
00:04:17.735 --> 00:04:20.172
revealing of
your character.

62
00:04:20.303 --> 00:04:24.002
Now. I know I used a little
too much tarragon last time.

63
00:04:24.133 --> 00:04:25.439
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
whoa. whoa. whoa.

64
00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:28.006
Hey. hey. hey. hey.
There you go.

65
00:04:28.137 --> 00:04:30.182
Hi. As I was saying.

66
00:04:30.313 --> 00:04:33.185
I. uh. know I used a little
too much tarragon last time.

67
00:04:33.316 --> 00:04:36.580
but. uh. this time.
I practiced restraint.

68
00:04:36.711 --> 00:04:39.496
What is wrong with you?

69
00:04:39.627 --> 00:04:41.019
Might be the best batch yet.

70
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.412
Seriously?

71
00:04:43.761 --> 00:04:45.023
Please?
Mm-mm.

72
00:04:45.154 --> 00:04:46.547
Come on. Come here.
Oh. no. no.

73
00:04:46.677 --> 00:04:48.200
Open.

74
00:04:48.331 --> 00:04:50.725
There you go.
There you go.

75
00:04:50.855 --> 00:04:52.596
There you go.

76
00:05:06.218 --> 00:05:09.091
You should know I'm not willing
to live the rest of my life

77
00:05:09.221 --> 00:05:11.093
wondering what your life
is like without me.

78
00:05:11.223 --> 00:05:13.138
What?
The only way...

79
00:05:13.269 --> 00:05:15.489
that I can move on...

80
00:05:17.665 --> 00:05:20.189
You know. I hated
my father's hunting trips.

81
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.410
Every year. being dragged
to some English countryside

82
00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.803
to trudge acres
of dreary terrain.

83
00:05:25.934 --> 00:05:27.370
But...

84
00:05:27.501 --> 00:05:31.809
I grew an admiration
for hunters.

85
00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.422
The patience and precision
it takes to make a kill.

86
00:05:35.552 --> 00:05:37.206
Please.

87
00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:40.340
Even though taking a life
at a distance lacks...

88
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.516
a level of intimacy.
don't you think?

89
00:05:42.646 --> 00:05:46.694
I mean. the butchering
process comes close

90
00:05:46.824 --> 00:05:48.391
if you do it right away.

91
00:05:48.522 --> 00:05:50.045
Mm-hmm.

92
00:05:50.175 --> 00:05:52.047
To stick your hands

93
00:05:52.177 --> 00:05:57.008
in between the warmth of
another creature's organs.

94
00:06:00.403 --> 00:06:03.928
I only know one other time
I've ever been inside

95
00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:06.148
another's body.

96
00:06:06.278 --> 00:06:07.889
Please.

97
00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.892
Oh.

98
00:06:11.022 --> 00:06:13.373
No.

99
00:06:13.503 --> 00:06:15.897
I wouldn't end you
with such a barbaric tool.

100
00:06:16.027 --> 00:06:18.029
No.

101
00:06:19.161 --> 00:06:21.163
This is for after.

102
00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:27.212
Because we both know

103
00:06:27.343 --> 00:06:31.260
the most intimate way
to end a life requires...

104
00:06:32.696 --> 00:06:35.351
...skin to skin.

105
00:06:35.482 --> 00:06:36.787
heartbeat...

106
00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:41.705
...to heartbeat...

107
00:06:45.361 --> 00:06:46.928
...touch.

108
00:06:51.628 --> 00:06:54.631
You can still change your mind
and sing for me.

109
00:06:56.459 --> 00:06:58.069
Come on. Sing for me.

110
00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.723
I can't.

111
00:07:05.816 --> 00:07:07.775
Sing for me!

112
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.088
Yeah.

113
00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:18.829
Yeah. okay. Yeah. I'm sorry.

114
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.527
I just. uh...
I'm still a little woozy

115
00:07:20.657 --> 00:07:22.224
from whatever
you gave me.

116
00:07:22.354 --> 00:07:24.792
Um. could I have my glasses. please?

117
00:07:24.922 --> 00:07:26.315
Please?

118
00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:28.273
Can I see you?

119
00:07:28.404 --> 00:07:30.275
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for leaving

120
00:07:30.406 --> 00:07:31.668
when things
were hard. I...

121
00:07:31.799 --> 00:07:33.191
And you-you didn't tell me why.

122
00:07:33.322 --> 00:07:34.628
I did.

123
00:07:34.758 --> 00:07:36.891
No. you-you didn't.
You just left.

124
00:07:37.021 --> 00:07:39.154
Okay. You're right.
And I'm sorry.

125
00:07:39.284 --> 00:07:42.026
I've just been so stressed with
work at the hospital. you know?

126
00:07:42.157 --> 00:07:44.246
But. um. maybe if-if we talk.

127
00:07:44.376 --> 00:07:46.291
if we go to therapy.

128
00:07:46.422 --> 00:07:48.729
I mean. yeah. that's-that's...
that's all I want.

129
00:07:48.859 --> 00:07:50.295
Okay. okay. Yeah.

130
00:07:50.426 --> 00:07:53.298
Yeah. willing to try.

131
00:07:53.429 --> 00:07:55.649
It's been really hard for me.

132
00:07:55.779 --> 00:07:57.215
I know.

133
00:07:57.346 --> 00:07:58.956
I know. Charlie.

134
00:07:59.087 --> 00:08:02.482
Um. can I please look at you
in the eyes?

135
00:08:02.612 --> 00:08:04.309
Please?

136
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:40.476
Here.

137
00:08:40.607 --> 00:08:41.956
Thank you.

138
00:08:42.086 --> 00:08:44.045
I just want to see you.
you know?

139
00:08:47.831 --> 00:08:49.877
Will you sing for me?

140
00:08:50.007 --> 00:08:51.356
Uh-huh. Yeah.

141
00:09:50.154 --> 00:09:52.461
Shit. shit. shit. shit.
shit. shit. shit.

142
00:10:47.385 --> 00:10:50.301
No. no. you make the caterers
get to the boat

143
00:10:50.432 --> 00:10:52.782
two hours before the guests.
No later.

144
00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.177
Gas grades aren't clear.

145
00:10:56.307 --> 00:10:57.874
They're not clear?

146
00:10:58.005 --> 00:10:59.789
They're not clear.
I just pumped 87 into my Beemer

147
00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.836
because the markings are all
fucked-up and faded.

148
00:11:02.966 --> 00:11:04.576
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

149
00:11:04.707 --> 00:11:07.275
This is more
than an inconvenience.

150
00:11:07.405 --> 00:11:08.929
That is a European

151
00:11:09.059 --> 00:11:10.452
luxury vehicle over there.

152
00:11:10.582 --> 00:11:11.975
It should only
sip 91 gas.

153
00:11:12.106 --> 00:11:14.282
I want a full refund.

154
00:11:14.412 --> 00:11:17.285
The gas is already in your car.

155
00:11:17.415 --> 00:11:18.721
That is because
you are not running

156
00:11:18.852 --> 00:11:19.983
a professional
business establishment.

157
00:11:20.114 --> 00:11:21.681
I'm sorry. ma'am.

158
00:11:21.811 --> 00:11:25.423
I can't give you a refund
for wrongly pumped gas.

159
00:11:25.554 --> 00:11:26.990
"Wrongly pumped gas"?

160
00:11:27.121 --> 00:11:28.557
That's what you're going with?

161
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.387
What is that smell?

162
00:11:34.302 --> 00:11:35.956
Oh. my God.

163
00:11:36.086 --> 00:11:38.610
This place is
fucking disgusting.

164
00:11:38.741 --> 00:11:40.787
There is no way
this place is up to code.

165
00:11:40.917 --> 00:11:42.527
I am calling the
Better Business Bureau.

166
00:11:42.658 --> 00:11:45.922
I'm gonna have this redneck
shithole place shut down.

167
00:11:46.053 --> 00:11:47.228
What'd you say your name was?

168
00:11:47.358 --> 00:11:49.099
I'll give you a refund.

169
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:50.753
That's what I thought.

170
00:12:00.589 --> 00:12:02.983
It's gonna take
two to three business days.

171
00:12:03.113 --> 00:12:04.288
"Two to three business days."

172
00:12:04.419 --> 00:12:06.290
With an attitude like that.
that's gonna

173
00:12:06.421 --> 00:12:08.292
get you a one-way ticket
to fucking nowhere.

174
00:12:10.773 --> 00:12:13.428
Is it okay if I just...

175
00:12:13.558 --> 00:12:15.822
Few of these? Oh. and...

176
00:12:58.647 --> 00:13:00.823
Oh. no. no. No. no. no. no. no.

177
00:13:00.954 --> 00:13:02.042
Please.

178
00:13:14.881 --> 00:13:16.491
Okay.

179
00:13:16.621 --> 00:13:18.232
Oh. shit.

180
00:13:21.931 --> 00:13:24.020
Come on. come on.

181
00:13:37.294 --> 00:13:38.382
Emily!

182
00:13:38.513 --> 00:13:40.167
No. no. no. no. no. no.

183
00:13:40.297 --> 00:13:42.647
Please pick up. Please pick up.
Please. Please pick--

184
00:13:42.778 --> 00:13:44.127
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>

185
00:13:44.258 --> 00:13:45.563
Oh. thank God.

186
00:13:45.694 --> 00:13:47.565
Okay. my name is Emily Kasahara.

187
00:13:47.696 --> 00:13:50.742
I've been drugged and kidnapped
by my ex. Charlie Bellwick.

188
00:13:50.873 --> 00:13:53.658
I don't know where I am.
but I'm somewhere in the forest.

189
00:13:53.789 --> 00:13:56.183
and I can't see anything
because I broke my glasses.

190
00:13:56.313 --> 00:13:58.228
<i>Okay. Where is
the kidnapper now?</i>

191
00:13:58.359 --> 00:14:02.276
I don't know. but I heard him
yell my name. so he's close.

192
00:14:02.406 --> 00:14:04.017
<i>Okay. Well. we're gonna
figure out where you are</i>

193
00:14:04.147 --> 00:14:06.062
<i>and get you help ASAP.</i>

194
00:14:06.193 --> 00:14:07.890
<i>Are location services
enabled on your phone?</i>

195
00:14:08.021 --> 00:14:09.718
No. I thought that
he was using them

196
00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:11.589
to track me.
so I turned them off.

197
00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.722
<i>That's okay.
I have your number. so we can</i>

198
00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:15.550
<i>work with your carrier
to determine your location.</i>

199
00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.378
Okay. How long until
the police get here?

200
00:14:17.508 --> 00:14:19.336
<i>I won't know until we locate
your exact position.</i>

201
00:14:19.467 --> 00:14:21.686
<i>but it can take up to an hour
to work with your carrier</i>

202
00:14:21.817 --> 00:14:23.340
<i>and local dispatch.</i>
What?

203
00:14:23.471 --> 00:14:24.951
Can't you go any faster?

204
00:14:25.081 --> 00:14:26.648
<i>We'll go as fast as we can. Emily.</i>

205
00:14:26.778 --> 00:14:28.780
Okay. well.
I can't see anything.

206
00:14:28.911 --> 00:14:31.305
Could you video-call me
and guide me to somewhere safe?

207
00:14:31.435 --> 00:14:33.263
<i>Unfortunately. we do not have
video capabilities.</i>

208
00:14:33.394 --> 00:14:36.397
<i>and it's against regulations
to use our personal devices.</i>

209
00:14:36.527 --> 00:14:38.051
Against regulations?
Are you kidding me?

210
00:14:38.181 --> 00:14:40.053
I'm about to get killed.

211
00:14:40.183 --> 00:14:41.881
<i>Emily. can you feel around
for a hiding place?</i>

212
00:14:42.011 --> 00:14:44.579
I can't stay in one place.
or he's gonna find--

213
00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:55.285
Okay.

214
00:14:55.416 --> 00:14:58.680
Oh... oh. no. No. no. no.

215
00:14:58.810 --> 00:14:59.942
No.

216
00:15:00.073 --> 00:15:02.292
No. no. no. No.

217
00:15:02.423 --> 00:15:05.034
Please. please work.
Please. please. please.

218
00:15:05.165 --> 00:15:06.340
Okay.

219
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:07.994
Um...

220
00:15:09.299 --> 00:15:10.953
Uh...

221
00:15:55.693 --> 00:15:57.304
Hello?
<i>Hello?</i>

222
00:15:57.434 --> 00:15:58.696
<i>Who is this?</i>

223
00:15:58.827 --> 00:16:00.524
It's Sam. Who's this?

224
00:16:00.655 --> 00:16:02.483
<i>Are you 911?</i>

225
00:16:02.613 --> 00:16:05.703
No. Uh...

226
00:16:05.834 --> 00:16:08.228
Oh. sh-- I'm... I think...
I think maybe I. um.

227
00:16:08.358 --> 00:16:10.447
accidentally dialed you earlier.

228
00:16:11.927 --> 00:16:13.407
Shh. shh. shh. shh.

229
00:16:13.537 --> 00:16:15.104
What?

230
00:16:15.235 --> 00:16:16.584
Shh!

231
00:16:31.512 --> 00:16:33.470
Hello?

232
00:16:49.965 --> 00:16:51.619
Oh. my God.

233
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:52.881
Oh. my God.

234
00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:54.752
<i>I think it was an animal.</i>

235
00:16:54.883 --> 00:16:56.885
<i>Oh. my God.</i>
I'm gonna go.

236
00:16:57.016 --> 00:16:58.452
No. no. no. no. Wait.

237
00:16:58.582 --> 00:16:59.757
<i>Wait. Can...</i>

238
00:16:59.888 --> 00:17:01.977
Can you do video calls. Sam?

239
00:17:02.108 --> 00:17:04.719
Uh. yeah. Why?

240
00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:06.329
Okay. Listen.

241
00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.157
My name is Emily.
and I have been kidnapped.

242
00:17:08.288 --> 00:17:10.855
<i>I can't see anything
because I broke my glasses.</i>

243
00:17:10.986 --> 00:17:13.597
<i>and all that I know is that
I am in the woods somewhere</i>

244
00:17:13.728 --> 00:17:16.600
<i>and my ex is coming to kill me.</i>

245
00:17:16.731 --> 00:17:18.211
What?

246
00:17:18.341 --> 00:17:20.691
Look. I just...
I need you to be my eyes for me.

247
00:17:20.822 --> 00:17:22.476
C-Can you... can you do that?

248
00:17:22.606 --> 00:17:24.391
Is this a scam or something?
'Cause--

249
00:17:24.521 --> 00:17:26.697
<i>No. I promise you
that this is very real.</i>

250
00:17:26.828 --> 00:17:29.613
If I can't get away from him.
he's going to kill me.

251
00:17:29.744 --> 00:17:31.615
I don't--

252
00:17:31.746 --> 00:17:33.965
<i>Look. I know that this sounds
like nonsense. but please.</i>

253
00:17:34.096 --> 00:17:36.011
Please. will you call me back?

254
00:17:36.142 --> 00:17:38.057
Why-why don't I call 911
for you?

255
00:17:38.187 --> 00:17:40.537
<i>Because I already called them.
and their fucking regulations</i>

256
00:17:40.668 --> 00:17:42.583
<i>won't let them video-call me.</i>

257
00:17:42.713 --> 00:17:44.498
<i>They're working to find
my location. but. um.</i>

258
00:17:44.628 --> 00:17:46.674
<i>it's gonna take a while.
so I just... I have to--</i>

259
00:17:46.804 --> 00:17:47.979
I-I don't think that--

260
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:50.591
My phone screen is
really broken.

261
00:17:50.721 --> 00:17:52.680
If you hang up.

262
00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:55.726
<i>I don't know if I'm gonna
be able to make another call.</i>

263
00:17:55.857 --> 00:17:58.642
I-I don't think I'm the person
to do this for you. I--

264
00:17:58.773 --> 00:18:01.558
<i>All you need to do is be
my eyes for me. That's it.</i>

265
00:18:01.689 --> 00:18:03.865
Please.
Look. I need to keep running.

266
00:18:03.995 --> 00:18:05.736
<i>I need to.
and I can't do it alone.</i>

267
00:18:05.867 --> 00:18:07.260
<i>If I don't...</i>

268
00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:08.913
<i>If I don't. I--</i>

269
00:18:09.044 --> 00:18:10.480
Okay. Okay.

270
00:18:10.611 --> 00:18:12.526
Okay. Okay. thank you.

271
00:18:12.656 --> 00:18:13.962
So. um.

272
00:18:14.093 --> 00:18:15.355
<i>just-just video-call me back.</i>

273
00:18:15.485 --> 00:18:17.313
Yeah. Uh. I-I'm...

274
00:18:17.444 --> 00:18:19.359
I'm gonna hang up now.

275
00:18:19.489 --> 00:18:21.448
<i>Okay. Thank you.</i>

276
00:18:21.578 --> 00:18:23.102
Okay.

277
00:18:43.426 --> 00:18:45.776
Damn it.

278
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.413
<i>Oh. thank God. I got worried.</i>

279
00:19:13.543 --> 00:19:15.937
Sorry. I. um.
just needed a second.

280
00:19:16.067 --> 00:19:17.547
<i>All right. I need
to figure out</i>

281
00:19:17.678 --> 00:19:20.463
which way to go.
so can you tell me what you see?

282
00:19:20.594 --> 00:19:22.770
Trees. Yeah. Trees. You're
in a forest.

283
00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:25.381
Okay. Uh. is there
a clearing in any direction?

284
00:19:25.512 --> 00:19:28.993
Uh. uh. yeah. uh.
to your left.

285
00:19:29.124 --> 00:19:31.909
Uh. maybe it'll be faster
without the trees.

286
00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.129
<i>Great. All right. now.
I need you to look behind me</i>

287
00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.349
<i>and make sure he's not there.
okay?</i>

288
00:19:37.567 --> 00:19:39.569
Okay. Uh...

289
00:19:45.227 --> 00:19:46.228
Wait. Stop.

290
00:19:46.359 --> 00:19:47.838
What was it?

291
00:19:49.536 --> 00:19:51.190
I thought I saw something move.

292
00:19:52.756 --> 00:19:54.541
I-I guess it was nothing.

293
00:19:54.671 --> 00:19:56.238
<i>It was nothing.
It's just. um...</i>

294
00:19:56.369 --> 00:19:58.153
Okay. um. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

295
00:19:58.284 --> 00:20:00.024
I. um... I should... I should...
I should probably call

296
00:20:00.155 --> 00:20:02.026
someone else for you.
because I just... I just can't.

297
00:20:02.157 --> 00:20:05.334
I can't.
<i>No. You're doing great.</i>

298
00:20:05.465 --> 00:20:08.772
<i>Sam. I'm gonna need you to take
a deep breath for me. okay?</i>

299
00:20:08.903 --> 00:20:11.862
<i>In... and out.</i>

300
00:20:11.993 --> 00:20:13.734
<i>Look. I-I know
that this is a lot.</i>

301
00:20:13.864 --> 00:20:16.345
<i>but it's a miracle I got you.</i>

302
00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:21.350
Miracle?

303
00:20:21.481 --> 00:20:23.004
<i>Yes.</i>

304
00:20:23.134 --> 00:20:24.571
A miracle.

305
00:20:27.051 --> 00:20:28.879
Okay.

306
00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:30.925
<i>Can you do another 360?</i>

307
00:20:31.055 --> 00:20:33.406
Yes. I can.

308
00:20:35.756 --> 00:20:37.671
<i>Which way. Sam? Which way?</i>

309
00:20:37.801 --> 00:20:40.151
<i>Okay. stop.</i>

310
00:20:40.282 --> 00:20:42.153
The clearing's to your right.

311
00:20:42.284 --> 00:20:43.807
<i>Right. Okay. Any obstructions?</i>

312
00:20:43.938 --> 00:20:46.506
Um. yeah. there's a-a tree.
Step to your left.

313
00:20:46.636 --> 00:20:47.985
Good?

314
00:20:48.116 --> 00:20:49.770
Uh. yeah. Yeah.

315
00:20:52.163 --> 00:20:53.426
<i>Okay. you're at the field now.</i>

316
00:20:53.556 --> 00:20:56.037
Great. What do you see?

317
00:20:56.167 --> 00:20:58.257
Is there a house?
Um. a landmark?

318
00:20:58.387 --> 00:21:00.868
- <i>A road anywhere?
- Uh...</i>

319
00:21:00.998 --> 00:21:03.523
<i>Um... stop.</i>

320
00:21:03.653 --> 00:21:07.048
I think I see a-a path
across the field.

321
00:21:07.178 --> 00:21:09.833
Great. Okay. let's go. Let's go.

322
00:21:15.056 --> 00:21:16.623
<i>Um. there hasn't been
any sign of him</i>

323
00:21:16.753 --> 00:21:18.320
<i>for a while.
which is good. but. um...</i>

324
00:21:18.451 --> 00:21:19.930
<i>I'll keep doing 360s in case.</i>

325
00:21:20.061 --> 00:21:21.845
<i>and if you see him.
you just have to</i>

326
00:21:21.976 --> 00:21:23.325
<i>give me a shout. okay.
and I'll just start running.</i>

327
00:21:23.456 --> 00:21:25.632
Oh. it sparkles.

328
00:21:25.762 --> 00:21:27.416
<i>And just make sure that
I don't trip on anything.</i>

329
00:21:27.547 --> 00:21:29.679
Hey. um. are you sure I can't

330
00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:31.202
<i>call. uh. family or friend.</i>

331
00:21:31.333 --> 00:21:33.074
<i>have them
call you back?</i>
What?

332
00:21:33.204 --> 00:21:35.729
<i>No. I haven't memorized
a number since middle school.</i>

333
00:21:35.859 --> 00:21:38.514
<i>Uh. it's just I'm at work.
and-and I am...</i>

334
00:21:38.645 --> 00:21:41.648
I'm so not good under stress. like...

335
00:21:41.778 --> 00:21:43.345
<i>Can you see your
own hands. Sam?</i>

336
00:21:43.476 --> 00:21:44.738
Yeah.

337
00:21:44.868 --> 00:21:46.261
Then you are
better-equipped than me.

338
00:21:46.392 --> 00:21:48.002
Right. uh--

339
00:21:48.132 --> 00:21:49.873
Please. listen. Um...

340
00:21:50.004 --> 00:21:51.658
God. I'm so jealous.

341
00:21:51.788 --> 00:21:55.226
<i>Uh. I-I've had shit eyes
since I was a kid.</i>

342
00:21:55.357 --> 00:21:57.403
<i>Do you know what they
used to called me back then?</i>

343
00:21:57.533 --> 00:21:59.100
Four Eyes?

344
00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:03.583
Nope. They would scream
"Missu Golightulee" at me.

345
00:22:03.713 --> 00:22:05.019
What's that?

346
00:22:05.149 --> 00:22:06.673
Bullshit in
<i>Breakfast at Tiffany's.</i>

347
00:22:06.803 --> 00:22:08.283
You never saw it?

348
00:22:08.414 --> 00:22:11.025
White actor in yellow face
with the taped-back eyes

349
00:22:11.155 --> 00:22:14.202
and. lucky for me. glasses.

350
00:22:14.333 --> 00:22:16.683
Yeah. yeah. I saw
clips on YouTube.

351
00:22:16.813 --> 00:22:18.337
It's-it's horrible.

352
00:22:18.467 --> 00:22:21.905
Yeah. I begged my mom for LASIK.
but I was too young.

353
00:22:22.036 --> 00:22:26.083
Then when I got older.
I chose not to get it.

354
00:22:26.214 --> 00:22:28.085
thinking that
people would take me

355
00:22:28.216 --> 00:22:30.914
more seriously as a doctor

356
00:22:31.045 --> 00:22:33.047
if I had glasses on.

357
00:22:34.527 --> 00:22:37.181
Pretty stupid decision
in hindsight. huh?

358
00:22:39.923 --> 00:22:41.621
You know. when
I was little.

359
00:22:41.751 --> 00:22:43.405
the kids playing
Power Rangers.

360
00:22:43.536 --> 00:22:47.104
they would make me
be Rita Repulsa.

361
00:22:47.235 --> 00:22:49.498
Oh. wait. is that
the evil lady with the staff?

362
00:22:49.629 --> 00:22:52.675
Yeah. and the nickname stuck
all the way through high school.

363
00:22:52.806 --> 00:22:56.113
Repulsa was written all
over my senior yearbook.

364
00:22:56.244 --> 00:22:58.464
God. kids can be such shit.

365
00:22:58.594 --> 00:22:59.943
Yeah.

366
00:23:00.074 --> 00:23:02.946
But hey. uh.
Rita was. like. a...

367
00:23:03.077 --> 00:23:06.036
a badass space witch. right?

368
00:23:06.167 --> 00:23:07.951
Yeah. I guess.

369
00:23:09.562 --> 00:23:10.780
Are you okay?

370
00:23:10.911 --> 00:23:13.304
Yeah. I'm fine.
Let's just. uh...

371
00:23:13.435 --> 00:23:16.003
Are we near the path yet?

372
00:23:16.133 --> 00:23:17.874
Oh. no.

373
00:23:18.005 --> 00:23:19.615
What?

374
00:23:19.746 --> 00:23:20.964
<i>I'm so sorry. Emily.</i>

375
00:23:21.095 --> 00:23:22.357
What is it?

376
00:23:22.488 --> 00:23:25.099
<i>It's not a path.</i>

377
00:23:25.229 --> 00:23:27.275
It's just a fallen tree.

378
00:23:27.406 --> 00:23:28.711
Oh. my God. I'm-I'm so sorry.

379
00:23:28.842 --> 00:23:30.452
How could I have thought
that that was a path?

380
00:23:30.583 --> 00:23:32.454
<i>What is... what is wrong
with me? I'm so sorry.</i>

381
00:23:32.585 --> 00:23:34.630
Nothing is wrong with you.

382
00:23:34.761 --> 00:23:37.590
Okay? It's fine.
Let's just keep going.

383
00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:40.636
Okay. but what if... what if I
missed sending you a better way?

384
00:23:40.767 --> 00:23:42.072
<i>You didn't lead me back</i>

385
00:23:42.203 --> 00:23:43.247
to the cabin. did you?

386
00:23:43.378 --> 00:23:44.510
No. no. but I--

387
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.208
Hey. it's okay.

388
00:23:47.338 --> 00:23:49.166
What is it?

389
00:23:49.297 --> 00:23:52.300
My wrists are. uh. zip-tied.
and I'm losing circulation.

390
00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:53.693
I got to get 'em off.

391
00:23:53.823 --> 00:23:55.346
Zip-tied? Oh. my God.

392
00:23:55.477 --> 00:23:57.218
And I didn't...
I didn't even realize.

393
00:23:57.348 --> 00:23:58.959
Okay. Uh. hold on.

394
00:23:59.089 --> 00:24:00.700
Let me see.

395
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:03.485
<i>Okay. I'm gonna stop for
a sec here. so you just have to</i>

396
00:24:03.616 --> 00:24:07.489
check behind me to make sure
that he's not here. okay?

397
00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:09.578
<i>Oh. no.</i>
What?

398
00:24:09.709 --> 00:24:11.711
Is he there?

399
00:24:11.841 --> 00:24:13.626
<i>Did you see him?</i>
What? Oh. no.

400
00:24:13.756 --> 00:24:15.541
No. it's just my-my battery's
low. but don't worry.

401
00:24:15.671 --> 00:24:18.108
<i>Okay? I have a charger.</i>
Jesus. You scared me.

402
00:24:18.239 --> 00:24:19.849
Sorry. I'm sorry.

403
00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:21.721
<i>My phone was fully charged</i>

404
00:24:21.851 --> 00:24:23.592
<i>when I left for my run
this morning.</i>

405
00:24:23.723 --> 00:24:27.074
<i>but I have no idea
how much I have left now.</i>

406
00:24:27.204 --> 00:24:28.902
Damn it.

407
00:24:29.032 --> 00:24:30.730
Maybe if you find me.
like. a rock or something.

408
00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:32.775
I could. uh...

409
00:24:35.256 --> 00:24:36.257
Is that Russian?

410
00:24:36.387 --> 00:24:38.738
Uh. I think so. It's a video.

411
00:24:57.104 --> 00:24:59.236
I never imagined
getting murdered

412
00:24:59.367 --> 00:25:01.543
would feel so absurd.

413
00:25:02.979 --> 00:25:04.503
Hey. okay?

414
00:25:04.633 --> 00:25:06.548
No one is getting
murdered today.

415
00:25:06.679 --> 00:25:08.245
Now. Sergei says

416
00:25:08.376 --> 00:25:10.596
you need to use your teeth
to tighten the zip ties.

417
00:25:10.726 --> 00:25:13.163
Sergei says tighten 'em?

418
00:25:13.294 --> 00:25:15.383
Yeah. The tighter they are.
the easier they'll snap.

419
00:25:15.514 --> 00:25:17.603
Now. bring your hands
down to your knee

420
00:25:17.733 --> 00:25:19.300
as you bring
your knee up.

421
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:21.650
You should probably
put the phone down.

422
00:25:21.781 --> 00:25:23.565
Okay.

423
00:25:23.696 --> 00:25:26.437
Okay. Yeah.

424
00:25:26.568 --> 00:25:28.004
Ready?

425
00:25:28.135 --> 00:25:31.051
One. Two. Three.

426
00:25:36.926 --> 00:25:38.406
<i>Emily?</i>

427
00:25:38.537 --> 00:25:40.408
Hold on. Hold on.
<i>Are you okay?</i>

428
00:25:40.539 --> 00:25:42.889
<i>I will be.
as long as he didn't hear me.</i>

429
00:25:43.019 --> 00:25:44.717
<i>Did the ties come off?</i>

430
00:25:44.847 --> 00:25:45.848
Yep.

431
00:25:45.979 --> 00:25:47.763
Yes! Sergei for the win.

432
00:25:47.894 --> 00:25:49.504
<i>Hey. but are-are you okay?</i>

433
00:25:49.635 --> 00:25:51.854
Uh. it cut me up. but there are

434
00:25:51.985 --> 00:25:53.334
no major blood vessels here.
so we're good.

435
00:25:53.464 --> 00:25:54.988
<i>Oh. no. You sure it's okay?</i>

436
00:25:55.118 --> 00:25:57.556
Yep. Perks of being
an ER doctor.

437
00:25:58.557 --> 00:25:59.993
Okay.

438
00:26:00.123 --> 00:26:01.777
Okay. let's go.

439
00:26:01.908 --> 00:26:03.431
Do you see anything else

440
00:26:03.562 --> 00:26:05.041
<i>around here
that looks promising?</i>

441
00:26:06.739 --> 00:26:08.479
I don't know.
I-I don't... It just...

442
00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:10.438
It all... it all looks the same.

443
00:26:26.106 --> 00:26:29.849
Hey. Uh. if you got
lost in the woods

444
00:26:29.979 --> 00:26:32.808
on one of your hunting trips.
what would you do?

445
00:26:33.853 --> 00:26:35.289
I wouldn't get lost.

446
00:26:35.419 --> 00:26:36.638
<i>Yeah. but if you did.</i>

447
00:26:36.769 --> 00:26:38.074
Hey. we-we got to go. Come on.

448
00:26:38.205 --> 00:26:39.467
One sec. Uh--

449
00:26:39.598 --> 00:26:40.903
Wouldn't happen.

450
00:26:41.034 --> 00:26:44.124
Right. but just...
just humor me. dude.

451
00:26:44.254 --> 00:26:45.691
I guess my best
bet would be

452
00:26:45.821 --> 00:26:48.476
to find a stream. river.

453
00:26:48.607 --> 00:26:50.783
Chances are it'll lead
me to civilization.

454
00:26:50.913 --> 00:26:52.349
if there's any around.

455
00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.568
Okay.

456
00:26:55.483 --> 00:26:56.745
In my belly.

457
00:26:56.876 --> 00:26:58.355
Hello?

458
00:26:58.486 --> 00:27:00.183
<i>One sec.</i>

459
00:27:00.314 --> 00:27:01.794
Four sixty-five.

460
00:27:01.924 --> 00:27:04.187
Four sixty-five for a dog?
That's highway robbery.

461
00:27:07.103 --> 00:27:08.278
Someone might've left
their card.

462
00:27:09.628 --> 00:27:10.803
Keep the change.

463
00:27:15.634 --> 00:27:17.853
Please don't come back.

464
00:27:17.984 --> 00:27:19.289
<i>What?</i>

465
00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.465
Okay. did you hear that?
About the water?

466
00:27:21.596 --> 00:27:24.555
Yeah. I heard. but. uh.
I left my divining rod at home.

467
00:27:24.686 --> 00:27:26.427
How do we find a stream. Sam?

468
00:27:26.557 --> 00:27:28.385
<i>Hold on.</i>

469
00:27:28.516 --> 00:27:30.866
Okay. it says that birds
can lead you to water.

470
00:27:30.997 --> 00:27:32.999
That. uh.
"in the evenings especially.

471
00:27:33.129 --> 00:27:35.479
following the flight path
of birds could lead you to H2O."

472
00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:38.874
Wait. I heard a flock of birds
fly above me a few minutes ago.

473
00:27:39.005 --> 00:27:40.920
Okay. great.
Uh. which way did they go?

474
00:27:43.792 --> 00:27:45.620
I think it's this way.

475
00:27:45.751 --> 00:27:48.101
<i>Okay. Let's go.</i>

476
00:28:05.422 --> 00:28:06.859
<i>Okay.</i>

477
00:28:06.989 --> 00:28:08.556
<i>Can you do another 360?</i>

478
00:28:10.732 --> 00:28:12.734
No sign of him.

479
00:28:12.865 --> 00:28:15.041
I think we might be safe
for a little bit.

480
00:28:15.171 --> 00:28:17.173
Just keep-keep walking. okay?

481
00:28:18.697 --> 00:28:20.307
Damn.

482
00:28:20.437 --> 00:28:22.178
It's starting
to get chilly.
<i>Where are you?</i>

483
00:28:22.309 --> 00:28:24.093
<i>It's lukewarm and humid here.</i>

484
00:28:24.224 --> 00:28:25.965
<i>You want
to trade?</i> Yeah.

485
00:28:26.095 --> 00:28:28.924
<i>Come on over. Sam.
Take my place.</i>

486
00:28:29.055 --> 00:28:30.621
Um. I'm in Michigan. I-I think.

487
00:28:30.752 --> 00:28:32.145
Unless he crossed state lines.

488
00:28:32.275 --> 00:28:33.755
<i>Where are you?</i>

489
00:28:36.018 --> 00:28:37.977
Uh. Florida.

490
00:28:38.107 --> 00:28:39.761
Oh. man.

491
00:28:39.892 --> 00:28:41.676
- Florida. beaches.
- Shit.

492
00:28:41.807 --> 00:28:43.809
Do you live
near the ocean?

493
00:28:43.939 --> 00:28:47.682
No. uh. Tallahassee is a
few hours from the ocean.

494
00:28:47.813 --> 00:28:49.423
Used to. though.

495
00:28:49.553 --> 00:28:53.383
Uh. Jacksonville's a couple
minutes from the water.

496
00:28:53.514 --> 00:28:54.994
I loved it.

497
00:28:55.124 --> 00:28:56.735
Why did you move away?

498
00:28:57.736 --> 00:28:59.346
A lot of things.

499
00:29:02.088 --> 00:29:03.393
Yeah.

500
00:29:03.524 --> 00:29:04.960
I can't believe
you're a doctor.

501
00:29:05.091 --> 00:29:06.919
You look so young.

502
00:29:07.049 --> 00:29:08.964
Yeah. it's the bane
of my existence. Sam.

503
00:29:09.095 --> 00:29:11.575
Even interns make
Doogie Howser jokes at me.

504
00:29:11.706 --> 00:29:13.621
Oh. God. I'm sorry.

505
00:29:13.752 --> 00:29:15.405
Oh. it's okay.
When I'm 70. I'll look 40.

506
00:29:15.536 --> 00:29:17.146
and no one will
force me to retire.

507
00:29:19.105 --> 00:29:22.499
Can I. um... can I
ask you a question?

508
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:24.937
Sure.

509
00:29:25.067 --> 00:29:27.853
What pushed you
to be a doctor?

510
00:29:27.983 --> 00:29:31.552
My mom is an ER nurse.
and she worked crazy hours. too.

511
00:29:31.682 --> 00:29:33.380
So when I was little.
I made this vow

512
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:35.034
that I'd become a doctor

513
00:29:35.164 --> 00:29:36.600
<i>so that I could be
in the hospital. too.</i>

514
00:29:36.731 --> 00:29:38.341
<i>and we could spend
more time together.</i>

515
00:29:38.472 --> 00:29:40.561
<i>It didn't exactly turn out
that way. but. uh.</i>

516
00:29:40.691 --> 00:29:42.389
now I just...
I want to work really hard

517
00:29:42.519 --> 00:29:44.565
so that I can give her
an easier life. you know?

518
00:29:44.695 --> 00:29:46.393
That's really nice.

519
00:29:46.523 --> 00:29:50.266
Yeah. uh. but...

520
00:29:50.397 --> 00:29:52.312
you know. she...

521
00:29:52.442 --> 00:29:54.401
she hates flying alone. and...

522
00:29:54.531 --> 00:29:57.273
<i>and she kept asking me when I'd
be able to take time off work</i>

523
00:29:57.404 --> 00:30:00.711
<i>so that I could go with her
to visit my grandma in Japan.</i>

524
00:30:00.842 --> 00:30:04.890
But I never did.
I never did. and. uh...

525
00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:06.892
<i>You know. it's. like.
the only thing that my mom.</i>

526
00:30:07.022 --> 00:30:08.807
<i>like. ever asked of me ever.
and now...</i>

527
00:30:08.937 --> 00:30:11.026
I don't know...

528
00:30:11.157 --> 00:30:13.202
I don't know if I'm gonna. uh...

529
00:30:13.333 --> 00:30:14.769
No. Okay? No.

530
00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:16.510
Um. you're...

531
00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.512
you're gonna buy tickets
just as soon as you get back.

532
00:30:18.642 --> 00:30:19.948
Yeah.

533
00:30:20.079 --> 00:30:21.558
Yeah. yeah. no. of course.

534
00:30:23.734 --> 00:30:25.301
<i>You said you were a cashier?</i>

535
00:30:25.432 --> 00:30:28.043
<i>Yeah. yeah. at this-this</i>

536
00:30:28.174 --> 00:30:31.394
really weird
gator-themed gas station.

537
00:30:31.525 --> 00:30:33.440
<i>It's a dream career.</i>
Hey. well.
at least it's--

538
00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:35.007
No. Uh-uh.

539
00:30:35.137 --> 00:30:36.269
No. don't try and make it
something it's not.

540
00:30:36.399 --> 00:30:38.880
<i>Okay? It's what was available.</i>

541
00:30:39.011 --> 00:30:40.403
Well. they need cashiers everywhere.

542
00:30:40.534 --> 00:30:42.188
<i>You could go back
to Jacksonville.</i>

543
00:30:42.318 --> 00:30:43.885
<i>work at a gas station
near the beach.</i>

544
00:30:44.016 --> 00:30:46.496
Uh. yeah. yeah.
I just. um.

545
00:30:46.627 --> 00:30:48.498
got to take care
of a few things first.

546
00:30:48.629 --> 00:30:50.109
<i>How long have you worked there?</i>

547
00:30:50.239 --> 00:30:52.111
Um. few years.

548
00:30:52.241 --> 00:30:54.635
I. uh... I moved back
to help my mom.

549
00:30:54.765 --> 00:30:56.245
And then she had
some health issues.

550
00:30:56.376 --> 00:30:57.899
Oh. I'm sorry.

551
00:30:58.030 --> 00:30:59.553
Well. how's she doing now?

552
00:31:01.729 --> 00:31:03.818
She's not. She...

553
00:31:03.949 --> 00:31:06.299
She passed. so...

554
00:31:06.429 --> 00:31:09.084
Oh. I'm so sorry. Sam.

555
00:31:09.215 --> 00:31:10.999
But hey. you know.
that-that is admirable

556
00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:13.175
that you stopped your life
to help her. I mean.

557
00:31:13.306 --> 00:31:14.785
<i>I'm sure she's really grateful</i>

558
00:31:14.916 --> 00:31:16.744
<i>that you were there for her.
you know?</i>

559
00:31:16.875 --> 00:31:18.441
Yeah.

560
00:31:18.572 --> 00:31:20.443
Maybe. yeah.

561
00:31:20.574 --> 00:31:21.967
<i>Wait. Do you hear that?</i>

562
00:31:23.011 --> 00:31:24.447
I hear water.

563
00:31:24.578 --> 00:31:26.014
<i>Can you see anything?</i>

564
00:31:26.145 --> 00:31:27.711
Uh. not yet.

565
00:31:27.842 --> 00:31:29.800
Just keep going. okay?

566
00:31:29.931 --> 00:31:32.368
Okay.

567
00:31:51.474 --> 00:31:53.737
Well. I found a lot of water

568
00:31:53.868 --> 00:31:55.870
but not the kind
we're looking for.

569
00:31:57.002 --> 00:31:58.960
All right.

570
00:31:59.091 --> 00:32:00.222
<i>See anything?</i>

571
00:32:00.353 --> 00:32:02.137
Uh. not yet.

572
00:32:02.268 --> 00:32:03.573
Wait. wait.

573
00:32:03.704 --> 00:32:04.923
<i>I see it. Okay. there's...</i>

574
00:32:05.053 --> 00:32:06.402
<i>There's a river down below.</i>

575
00:32:06.533 --> 00:32:09.144
Oh. great work. Sam. Yes. Okay.

576
00:32:09.275 --> 00:32:11.016
<i>All right.
let's get me down there.</i>

577
00:32:11.146 --> 00:32:13.105
Okay.

578
00:32:13.235 --> 00:32:14.671
Hey. oh. um. careful.

579
00:32:14.802 --> 00:32:16.108
It's a drop-off.

580
00:32:16.238 --> 00:32:19.459
Um. let's just find
an easier spot.

581
00:32:19.589 --> 00:32:21.069
uh. for you
to climb down.

582
00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.375
Okay. okay.

583
00:32:22.505 --> 00:32:24.812
Tell me when
you see something. okay?

584
00:32:27.293 --> 00:32:29.077
Son of a bitch.

585
00:32:29.208 --> 00:32:31.732
<i>What?</i>

586
00:32:31.862 --> 00:32:34.909
No. no. no. no. no.

587
00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:37.259
Sam. Sam. is it still too steep?

588
00:32:39.435 --> 00:32:42.221
<i>Hey. Sam. Sam.
is it still too steep here?</i>

589
00:32:42.351 --> 00:32:43.962
Um. just-just hold on. okay?
Just--

590
00:32:44.092 --> 00:32:45.876
<i>Yeah?</i>

591
00:32:46.007 --> 00:32:48.705
Um. shit.
Just hold on one second. okay?

592
00:32:50.185 --> 00:32:52.274
<i>Ah. shit!</i>

593
00:32:52.405 --> 00:32:53.884
Shit.

594
00:32:55.799 --> 00:32:57.540
Emily. are you there?
Emily. I can't see you.

595
00:32:59.151 --> 00:33:01.283
Emily. are you okay?

596
00:33:01.414 --> 00:33:03.372
Oh. God.

597
00:33:03.503 --> 00:33:05.331
Ah. shit.

598
00:33:05.461 --> 00:33:07.463
Thank God. I can't see you.

599
00:33:07.594 --> 00:33:09.335
<i>I have my earbud.
but I dropped my phone.</i>

600
00:33:09.465 --> 00:33:10.989
<i>Where are you?</i>
Okay. Okay.

601
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:13.687
Where are you. Sam?

602
00:33:13.817 --> 00:33:15.863
<i>Um. I'm...</i>

603
00:33:15.994 --> 00:33:18.170
I'm looking away from the river.
uh. towards the forest.

604
00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:21.303
Okay. um... God. I'm sorry.

605
00:33:21.434 --> 00:33:23.088
Okay. I was distracted. Okay.

606
00:33:23.218 --> 00:33:25.525
<i>I think I'm going away
from the river. Hold on.</i>

607
00:33:30.356 --> 00:33:32.053
Stay.

608
00:33:32.184 --> 00:33:34.229
Do you
see me yet?
<i>No. not yet.</i>

609
00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:36.188
Can you see any movement?

610
00:33:36.318 --> 00:33:37.537
No.

611
00:33:37.667 --> 00:33:39.582
I think I see
some grass or. um...

612
00:33:39.713 --> 00:33:40.975
There's a forest.

613
00:33:41.106 --> 00:33:42.977
I don't quite know.

614
00:33:46.154 --> 00:33:47.895
No. come on.

615
00:33:48.026 --> 00:33:50.158
Maybe if I just...

616
00:33:52.421 --> 00:33:53.683
Okay.

617
00:33:55.337 --> 00:33:56.817
Wait.

618
00:33:56.947 --> 00:33:58.645
I hear an engine.

619
00:33:58.775 --> 00:34:01.126
That's great. That's great.
Okay. let's go find 'em.

620
00:34:02.692 --> 00:34:04.172
I think he's here.

621
00:34:04.303 --> 00:34:06.131
Oh. no.

00:37:08.138 --> 00:37:10.837
Sam. where is his car?

701
00:37:16.582 --> 00:37:17.670
Right.

702
00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:20.020
Go right.

703
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:22.718
Okay. you're headed
towards the driver's side.

704
00:37:22.849 --> 00:37:25.068
Just keep walking.

705
00:37:25.199 --> 00:37:26.592
Turn left for the door.

706
00:37:26.722 --> 00:37:28.637
Reach out.

707
00:37:28.768 --> 00:37:30.291
Did he leave his key
in the ignition?

708
00:37:30.422 --> 00:37:31.684
Yeah.

709
00:37:31.814 --> 00:37:33.816
Yes! What a fucking fool.

710
00:37:41.824 --> 00:37:42.869
He's here.

711
00:37:42.999 --> 00:37:45.698
He's here. Duck.

712
00:37:45.828 --> 00:37:47.569
Start the engine. Go. <i>Wait.</i>

713
00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.832
<i>Is he coming towards us
from the front?</i>

714
00:37:49.963 --> 00:37:51.617
Yeah. yeah. Start the car.

715
00:37:51.747 --> 00:37:53.227
Tell me when he's back
right in front of us.

716
00:37:53.358 --> 00:37:55.403
What? Why?

717
00:37:55.534 --> 00:37:57.362
If something happens. I don't
want him coming after me again.

718
00:37:57.492 --> 00:37:58.928
We have the advantage now.

719
00:37:59.059 --> 00:38:00.974
Let's just...
let's just stop him for good.

720
00:38:01.104 --> 00:38:03.106
What are you gonna do? Are you
gonna try and run him over?

721
00:38:03.237 --> 00:38:04.934
No. let's just go. okay?

722
00:38:05.065 --> 00:38:06.675
Tell me when he's here.

723
00:38:06.806 --> 00:38:07.981
Oh. my God. Emily.

724
00:38:08.111 --> 00:38:09.243
<i>Is he there?</i>

725
00:38:09.374 --> 00:38:10.592
Not yet.

726
00:38:10.723 --> 00:38:12.377
<i>Now?</i>
No.

727
00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:23.388
<i>Now!</i>

728
00:38:27.522 --> 00:38:29.437
<i>Oh. my God. you got him!</i>
Yes!

729
00:38:29.568 --> 00:38:31.396
<i>Wait. Stop. Brake! Brake!</i>

730
00:38:36.444 --> 00:38:38.403
Emily!

731
00:38:38.533 --> 00:38:39.969
<i>Emily!</i>

732
00:38:48.456 --> 00:38:51.633
<i>Emily. are you okay?</i>

733
00:38:51.764 --> 00:38:53.069
<i>Hello?</i>

734
00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:54.897
We got him. right?

735
00:38:55.028 --> 00:38:56.986
<i>Yeah. Yeah. Are you okay?</i>

736
00:38:57.117 --> 00:38:59.206
I mean. I'm alive.

737
00:38:59.337 --> 00:39:01.208
<i>Nothing's
- fractured.
- Okay.</i>

738
00:39:01.339 --> 00:39:02.688
<i>Where are you?</i>

739
00:39:02.818 --> 00:39:05.343
Uh. uh. it flew onto the floor.

740
00:39:05.473 --> 00:39:08.563
<i>To your right. To your right.</i>

741
00:39:08.694 --> 00:39:10.913
<i>Did we kill him?</i>

742
00:39:11.044 --> 00:39:12.611
I don't know.

743
00:39:12.741 --> 00:39:14.395
<i>Here. look.</i>

744
00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:16.789
I can't see him.

745
00:39:16.919 --> 00:39:18.747
<i>I can't... I... Let's go.</i>

746
00:39:18.878 --> 00:39:20.401
<i>Emily!</i>
Okay. okay.

747
00:39:20.532 --> 00:39:22.577
<i>We got to go.</i>

748
00:39:22.708 --> 00:39:24.231
Sam.

749
00:39:24.362 --> 00:39:27.147
It-it's stuck. Sam.
It's... Fuck. it's stuck!

750
00:39:27.277 --> 00:39:29.062
<i>Shit!</i>
What's stuck?
What's stuck?

751
00:39:29.192 --> 00:39:30.716
Sam. the car. the car is stuck.

752
00:39:30.846 --> 00:39:33.153
What do we do?
<i>Oh. no.</i>

753
00:39:33.283 --> 00:39:35.155
<i>Shit. I don't know.</i>

754
00:39:38.288 --> 00:39:40.987
<i>What-what's going on?</i>

755
00:39:41.117 --> 00:39:43.772
<i>Sam. do you see anything sharp?</i>

756
00:39:43.903 --> 00:39:45.557
Uh...

757
00:39:45.687 --> 00:39:47.472
No?
<i>Uh. no.</i>

758
00:39:49.474 --> 00:39:50.562
How about here?

759
00:39:50.692 --> 00:39:52.302
Uh...

760
00:39:52.433 --> 00:39:54.827
I don't... I don't see anything.
Oh. wait. there.

761
00:39:54.957 --> 00:39:56.829
There's. uh. a piece of mirror
on the ground.

762
00:39:56.959 --> 00:39:58.961
Tell me when you see it.

763
00:39:59.092 --> 00:40:00.746
<i>It's right there.
right in front of you.</i>

764
00:40:00.876 --> 00:40:03.096
<i>Reach out. Be careful.
Careful. it's sharp.</i>

765
00:40:04.967 --> 00:40:06.055
You got it?
<i>Yeah.</i>

766
00:40:06.186 --> 00:40:07.796
Why-why... What are you--

767
00:40:07.927 --> 00:40:09.276
Do you see him?

768
00:40:09.407 --> 00:40:11.757
<i>Um... um...</i>

769
00:40:11.887 --> 00:40:14.150
Uh. uh...

770
00:40:14.281 --> 00:40:17.371
Just keep going around the car.

771
00:40:17.502 --> 00:40:18.764
<i>Do you see him now?</i>
He's there.

772
00:40:18.894 --> 00:40:20.156
There. on your left.

773
00:40:20.287 --> 00:40:22.202
Um. he's on the ground.

774
00:40:22.332 --> 00:40:24.247
Direct me to him. Sam.

775
00:40:24.378 --> 00:40:25.858
Emily. what are you doing?

776
00:40:25.988 --> 00:40:27.425
Let's go. okay?

777
00:40:27.555 --> 00:40:28.948
<i>Just go.</i>
I need to know
if he's dead.

778
00:40:31.907 --> 00:40:33.169
He's still breathing.

779
00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:35.694
Okay.

780
00:40:35.824 --> 00:40:37.347
<i>I'm gonna end this now.</i>

781
00:40:37.478 --> 00:40:39.175
Emily. what are you doing?

782
00:40:39.306 --> 00:40:42.918
You have no idea what this man
has put me through. Sam.

783
00:40:43.049 --> 00:40:44.616
Emily. this isn't you. okay?

784
00:40:44.746 --> 00:40:46.922
No. I don't... I don't know.
but let's just go. okay?

785
00:40:47.053 --> 00:40:48.228
If he just left me alone.
none of this would've happened.

786
00:40:48.358 --> 00:40:49.795
<i>No. but don't do it. Emily.</i>

787
00:40:49.925 --> 00:40:51.797
<i>Whatever you do.
don't do it. Just...</i>

788
00:40:51.927 --> 00:40:53.407
<i>I can get you out of here.
I got you. okay?</i>

789
00:40:53.538 --> 00:40:55.453
<i>Let's just get out of here. Emily...</i>

790
00:40:55.583 --> 00:40:56.715
Emily. he's moving. Please.

791
00:40:56.845 --> 00:40:58.325
<i>Emily. Emily.</i>

792
00:40:58.456 --> 00:40:59.935
<i>Emily. please. Emily.</i>

793
00:41:01.284 --> 00:41:03.461
<i>Emily. he's moving. Please!</i>

794
00:41:04.679 --> 00:41:06.202
Okay.

795
00:41:06.333 --> 00:41:07.421
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. yeah. yeah.

796
00:41:07.552 --> 00:41:09.075
You're right.

797
00:41:09.205 --> 00:41:11.033
<i>But I'm keeping this
just in case. okay?</i>

798
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:13.862
Okay. Okay. <i>Now...</i>

799
00:41:13.993 --> 00:41:16.038
Which way? Which way?

800
00:41:16.169 --> 00:41:17.736
Um. uh. let me see.

801
00:41:17.866 --> 00:41:19.564
Okay. let's. um...

802
00:41:19.694 --> 00:41:21.740
<i>T-To your right. okay?
Just keep going straight.</i>

803
00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:23.872
<i>It's clear for a while.
We'll just... we'll walk</i>

804
00:41:24.003 --> 00:41:25.526
<i>above the river.
okay?</i>
Okay.

805
00:41:25.657 --> 00:41:27.267
<i>He looked really hurt.
We're safe for now.</i>

806
00:41:27.397 --> 00:41:28.442
<i>Just keep going.</i>

807
00:41:28.573 --> 00:41:29.965
Okay.

808
00:41:31.314 --> 00:41:32.707
Fuck.

809
00:41:32.838 --> 00:41:33.969
Oh. fuck.

810
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.536
<i>What did you say?</i>

811
00:41:35.667 --> 00:41:37.364
Emily. uh...

812
00:41:37.495 --> 00:41:39.279
Emily. I'm gonna have to. uh...

813
00:41:39.409 --> 00:41:41.107
<i>What?</i>
Ah. shit.

814
00:41:41.237 --> 00:41:43.979
Uh. I'm gonna have to start
making some calls.

815
00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:45.590
To do... to do what. Sam?

816
00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.243
<i>To find another phone.</i>

817
00:41:47.374 --> 00:41:49.332
<i>I broke mine.
I can't charge it anymore.</i>

818
00:41:49.463 --> 00:41:51.160
What do you mean.
you broke your phone?

819
00:41:51.291 --> 00:41:53.380
<i>It snapped. I--</i>
When?

820
00:41:53.511 --> 00:41:55.904
Earlier. You fell. and then he--

821
00:41:56.035 --> 00:41:57.253
So. why didn't you
tell me earlier?

822
00:41:57.384 --> 00:41:58.777
Why didn't you tell me
when I fell?

823
00:41:58.907 --> 00:41:59.995
Emily. the charger
broke off on the phone.

824
00:42:00.126 --> 00:42:01.867
and now it-it's stuck. okay?

825
00:42:01.997 --> 00:42:03.216
How could that even happen?

826
00:42:03.346 --> 00:42:04.913
<i>I... I don't know. Oh.</i>

827
00:42:05.044 --> 00:42:06.524
Oh. shit. there's a stump.

828
00:42:06.654 --> 00:42:07.829
<i>Step.</i>

829
00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.657
Okay.

830
00:42:09.788 --> 00:42:12.094
Is there somebody at your work
who can lend you a phone?

831
00:42:12.225 --> 00:42:13.574
Uh. no. No. I'm alone.

832
00:42:13.705 --> 00:42:15.097
<i>A friend that can bring
you one?</i>

833
00:42:15.228 --> 00:42:16.316
Shit. No. let me think.

834
00:42:16.446 --> 00:42:17.752
Let me think. Let me think.

835
00:42:17.883 --> 00:42:19.188
Oh. fuck.

836
00:42:19.319 --> 00:42:20.494
Um...

837
00:42:20.625 --> 00:42:22.844
No. no.

838
00:42:25.064 --> 00:42:28.502
<i>♪ She'll put you
Under her spell ♪</i>

839
00:42:28.633 --> 00:42:31.984
<i>♪ 'Cause she's
Batshit crazy...♪</i>

840
00:42:33.725 --> 00:42:35.422
Shit.

841
00:43:11.545 --> 00:43:13.373
<i>♪ She'll send you
Straight to hell... ♪</i>

842
00:43:13.503 --> 00:43:14.809
Shit.

843
00:43:17.812 --> 00:43:19.335
Hey. uh. Emily.

844
00:43:19.466 --> 00:43:21.163
Okay. quick.
give me your number.

845
00:43:21.294 --> 00:43:22.687
Did you get a phone?

846
00:43:22.817 --> 00:43:24.514
I will in a sec.
okay. but if my phone dies.

847
00:43:24.645 --> 00:43:25.907
I need your number. <i>Okay.</i>

848
00:43:26.038 --> 00:43:29.476
Eight. one. zero.
one. four. seven.

849
00:43:29.607 --> 00:43:32.087
<i>zero. one. eight. five.</i>

850
00:43:32.218 --> 00:43:33.436
Eight. five. Okay.

851
00:43:33.567 --> 00:43:35.438
All right. Got it.

852
00:43:35.569 --> 00:43:37.223
Okay. My eyes might
have to leave you

853
00:43:37.353 --> 00:43:39.225
for a second. okay.
so be careful.

854
00:43:39.355 --> 00:43:41.357
I'm gonna try and borrow
this woman's phone.

855
00:43:41.488 --> 00:43:43.142
<i>Oh. no. Sam. Sam.</i>
What?

856
00:43:43.272 --> 00:43:44.273
Sam. I hear footsteps.

857
00:43:44.404 --> 00:43:46.014
He's already caught up.

858
00:43:46.145 --> 00:43:48.103
No. Already? Okay. show me.

859
00:43:48.234 --> 00:43:50.497
No. Not the '98.

860
00:43:50.628 --> 00:43:52.412
He was saving that
for the mayor's gala.

861
00:43:52.542 --> 00:43:53.848
The '03 Château Margaux.

862
00:43:53.979 --> 00:43:55.284
I'm not sure. I'm not sure.

863
00:43:55.415 --> 00:43:57.373
Hey. Excuse me.
Excuse me.

864
00:43:57.504 --> 00:43:59.941
You were so rude earlier
that I left my Amex.

865
00:44:00.072 --> 00:44:01.290
Um. just give me a moment. okay?

866
00:44:01.421 --> 00:44:02.770
Absolutely not.

867
00:44:02.901 --> 00:44:04.685
I am missing my
<i>fête de yacht</i>

868
00:44:04.816 --> 00:44:07.035
because of you. because
of how rude you were.

869
00:44:07.166 --> 00:44:09.037
You probably don't speak French.
but that means "yacht party."

870
00:44:09.168 --> 00:44:10.648
Okay. just give me
one second. okay?

871
00:44:10.778 --> 00:44:13.259
There is a woman
who is about to get murdered.

872
00:44:13.389 --> 00:44:14.695
What kind of crack
are you smoking?

873
00:44:14.826 --> 00:44:16.610
Shit!

874
00:44:16.741 --> 00:44:18.481
Shit. Emily! He's headed
straight for you. okay?

875
00:44:18.612 --> 00:44:20.440
<i>Turn around! Go! Go!
He has a gun!</i>

876
00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:22.181
Which way?
<i>He's headed straight
for you!</i>

877
00:44:22.311 --> 00:44:23.835
Excuse me.
Turn around!
Turn around! Go!

878
00:44:23.965 --> 00:44:25.488
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Go! He's got a gun. Emily!

879
00:44:25.619 --> 00:44:26.794
Straight. Straight. Yeah. stop.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

880
00:44:26.925 --> 00:44:28.317
Excuse me. I'm standing
in front of you.

881
00:44:28.448 --> 00:44:29.797
I'm a customer.

882
00:44:29.928 --> 00:44:31.103
A paying customer.
No. No. no. No. no.

883
00:44:31.233 --> 00:44:32.365
No!
What could be
more important

884
00:44:32.495 --> 00:44:34.019
than what-- Hey!
No! Emily. no!

885
00:44:34.149 --> 00:44:35.977
Sam?

886
00:44:36.108 --> 00:44:38.240
Sam. Sam. Sam.

887
00:44:46.292 --> 00:44:47.989
<i>Excuse me.</i>

888
00:44:49.208 --> 00:44:50.644
Hey. Go get my card.

889
00:44:50.775 --> 00:44:52.777
Hey. Can-can-can I use
your phone. please?

890
00:44:52.907 --> 00:44:55.344
You think I'm gonna
let you touch this? Ew. No.

891
00:44:55.475 --> 00:44:56.955
Please. There...
there is a woman.

892
00:44:57.085 --> 00:44:58.478
I answered her call today--

893
00:44:58.608 --> 00:45:01.568
All of this. I don't
give a shit about. okay?

894
00:45:01.699 --> 00:45:04.092
Just scurry back into your
cage and get me my card.

895
00:45:04.223 --> 00:45:05.790
What now?

896
00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:07.095
Please.

897
00:45:07.226 --> 00:45:09.445
Please.
Go.

898
00:45:09.576 --> 00:45:12.710
Well. just slow down.

899
00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:15.669
Oh. that...
that is bullshit.

900
00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:18.454
Oh. fuck wind speed.
You tell that driver

901
00:45:18.585 --> 00:45:21.022
he is not weaseling out of this
just to keep our deposit.

902
00:45:22.850 --> 00:45:24.373
You're a...

903
00:45:24.504 --> 00:45:26.549
Do you know what that means?
That's "shithead" in French.

904
00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:28.508
Cut off some of
the Williams Sonoma cheese.

905
00:45:28.638 --> 00:45:29.552
but don't eat any

906
00:45:29.683 --> 00:45:30.597
until I get back.

907
00:45:30.728 --> 00:45:31.641
I'll be there in ten.

908
00:45:34.949 --> 00:45:36.690
Little bitch! Fucking...

909
00:45:39.998 --> 00:45:41.608
Okay.

910
00:45:45.568 --> 00:45:47.614
Fucking trailer trash cunt!

911
00:45:47.745 --> 00:45:49.398
Give that back to me now!

912
00:45:49.529 --> 00:45:52.010
Eat all the Williams Sonoma
cheese you want.

913
00:46:24.694 --> 00:46:27.959
You know. in the wild.

914
00:46:28.089 --> 00:46:30.657
there are these. uh.
pack hunters.

915
00:46:30.788 --> 00:46:34.269
Animals that rely
on others to live.

916
00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.489
But. you see.
I have always seen myself--

917
00:46:36.619 --> 00:46:38.491
Shut up!

918
00:46:38.621 --> 00:46:40.754
Shut the fuck up!

919
00:46:40.885 --> 00:46:43.191
I am so sick of your blah.

920
00:46:43.322 --> 00:46:44.627
blah. blah. blah. blah.
blah. blah. blah!

921
00:46:44.758 --> 00:46:47.195
No one wants
to hear you talk. Charlie.

922
00:46:47.326 --> 00:46:48.980
I mean. you think
of yourself as

923
00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:50.720
this modern-day
alpha male philosopher?

924
00:46:50.851 --> 00:46:52.853
Well. you're
just a spoiled.

925
00:46:52.984 --> 00:46:56.683
rich trust-fund kid
that parrots back bad TED Talks.

926
00:46:56.814 --> 00:46:58.903
Yeah! They're bad!

927
00:47:01.775 --> 00:47:03.211
I called 911.

928
00:47:03.342 --> 00:47:04.778
They have your name.

929
00:47:04.909 --> 00:47:06.432
They're tracking
my location.

930
00:47:06.562 --> 00:47:08.521
and they're on their way
right now.

931
00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:13.743
What. are you still gonna
go through with this?

932
00:47:13.874 --> 00:47:15.441
You're gonna get
caught. Charlie.

933
00:47:15.571 --> 00:47:17.573
Sure.

934
00:47:17.704 --> 00:47:19.967
But there's a difference
between getting caught

935
00:47:20.098 --> 00:47:21.926
and being convicted.

936
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:28.236
You don't get to do this to me

937
00:47:28.367 --> 00:47:29.890
and get away with it.

938
00:47:41.597 --> 00:47:44.252
Now. what do you have
to say for yourself?

939
00:47:44.383 --> 00:47:45.775
I don't care. Charlie.

940
00:47:45.906 --> 00:47:47.212
I don't care.

941
00:47:47.342 --> 00:47:49.431
Kill me if you want. but you.

942
00:47:49.562 --> 00:47:51.869
you do not get to murder me
and play the victim.

943
00:47:52.913 --> 00:47:53.958
I am the victim.

944
00:47:54.088 --> 00:47:56.003
Are you kidding me?

945
00:47:56.134 --> 00:47:57.483
No. the victim
of your abandonment.

946
00:47:57.613 --> 00:47:58.614
Neglect.
My--

947
00:47:58.745 --> 00:48:00.094
After I gave you everything.

948
00:48:00.225 --> 00:48:01.704
The romantic surprises.

949
00:48:01.835 --> 00:48:03.968
the trips.
the emotional support.

950
00:48:04.098 --> 00:48:06.971
Are you forgetting the jealousy?

951
00:48:07.101 --> 00:48:09.321
Are you forgetting
the stalking?

952
00:48:09.451 --> 00:48:11.540
The holes in my wall?
The bruises?

953
00:48:11.671 --> 00:48:13.455
Well. you pushed me there.

954
00:48:13.586 --> 00:48:15.022
Look. how am I supposed to feel

955
00:48:15.153 --> 00:48:16.850
when you would rather spend
100-hour weeks

956
00:48:16.981 --> 00:48:19.635
with disgusting sick people
than with me?

957
00:48:19.766 --> 00:48:22.116
But you're so addicted
to the validation

958
00:48:22.247 --> 00:48:24.162
that you get at work--
I am not.

959
00:48:25.946 --> 00:48:27.992
What you will never understand. Charlie.

960
00:48:28.122 --> 00:48:30.124
is that some people do things

961
00:48:30.255 --> 00:48:32.692
for other things
besides validation.

962
00:48:32.822 --> 00:48:34.999
I work my fucking ass off
so that my mom

963
00:48:35.129 --> 00:48:36.348
can have a better life.
Your mom?

964
00:48:36.478 --> 00:48:38.350
It's not for your mom!

965
00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:41.266
God. how many times
did I see you ignore her calls?

966
00:48:41.396 --> 00:48:43.094
You see. the truth is. Em--

967
00:48:43.224 --> 00:48:44.747
Do not call me that.

968
00:48:46.488 --> 00:48:49.578
You've convinced yourself
that you work so much

969
00:48:49.709 --> 00:48:51.754
to be a good daughter.

970
00:48:51.885 --> 00:48:54.975
but it actually makes you
a fucking horrible one.

971
00:48:55.106 --> 00:48:56.759
A horrible daughter

972
00:48:56.890 --> 00:49:00.938
and a completely neglectful
partner to me.

973
00:49:04.245 --> 00:49:07.683
This is what you do. Charlie.

974
00:49:07.814 --> 00:49:10.643
You find what hurts in people.

975
00:49:10.773 --> 00:49:12.558
and then... and then...

976
00:49:12.688 --> 00:49:14.603
and then you use it
like a weapon.

977
00:49:15.865 --> 00:49:17.563
Doesn't mean I'm wrong.

978
00:49:31.446 --> 00:49:32.491
Stop.

979
00:49:34.014 --> 00:49:35.015
No! Stop!

980
00:49:48.724 --> 00:49:50.683
Fuck!

981
00:49:56.602 --> 00:49:59.213
Hey. fuck. I want my fucking
phone back. you bitch.

982
00:49:59.344 --> 00:50:02.086
For the last time.
it's an emergency.

983
00:50:02.216 --> 00:50:03.696
Whose fucking emergency is it?

984
00:50:03.826 --> 00:50:05.306
It's not my emergency.

985
00:50:05.437 --> 00:50:07.395
My emergency is that
you took my fucking phone!

986
00:50:07.526 --> 00:50:09.745
I'm not afraid of you.

987
00:50:11.051 --> 00:50:12.879
All right.

988
00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:15.882
You want a fucking war?

989
00:50:16.013 --> 00:50:17.536
You got one.

990
00:50:19.755 --> 00:50:22.062
You better start
fucking praying.

991
00:50:30.070 --> 00:50:31.332
Okay.

992
00:50:33.595 --> 00:50:35.467
Fuck. I thought
it was in this one.

993
00:50:38.165 --> 00:50:39.688
No. no. no. no. no.

994
00:50:51.483 --> 00:50:53.050
Nobody does this to me.

995
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:25.604
Where are you. you gator fuck?

996
00:51:28.215 --> 00:51:30.217
Come out. come out.

997
00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:34.439
You hiding from me?
Shit. Shit.

998
00:51:34.569 --> 00:51:36.223
Got a little surprise
for you. Okay.

999
00:51:37.137 --> 00:51:39.444
Don't shoot. okay?

1000
00:51:39.574 --> 00:51:41.533
I can't afford to get shot.
I don't have insurance.

1001
00:51:41.663 --> 00:51:44.536
You deserve a bullet for putting
your filthy hands on my phone.

1002
00:51:44.666 --> 00:51:47.365
That case costs more
than you make in a year.

1003
00:51:47.495 --> 00:51:49.106
It's 24-karat gold.
Now. hand it over.

1004
00:51:50.498 --> 00:51:52.935
Okay.
Now!

1005
00:51:53.066 --> 00:51:54.241
No. not on the f--

1006
00:51:54.372 --> 00:51:56.678
You fuck!

1007
00:52:07.254 --> 00:52:09.126
Okay. Okay.

1008
00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:13.434
Okay.

1009
00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:18.047
What? What does it say?

1010
00:52:58.087 --> 00:53:00.089
Call Hubby Wubby.

1011
00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:01.874
Fuck. Okay.

1012
00:53:41.087 --> 00:53:43.002
<i>We're sorry.</i>

1013
00:53:43.132 --> 00:53:45.134
<i>Your call cannot
be completed.</i> Okay.

1014
00:53:45.265 --> 00:53:47.789
Eight. one. zero.

1015
00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:51.097
one. four. seven.
zero. one. five. five.

1016
00:53:51.228 --> 00:53:53.055
Okay. Uh...

1017
00:53:55.188 --> 00:53:57.321
Man. what the hell? Okay. um...

1018
00:53:57.451 --> 00:53:59.410
Three. eight. Three. eight.

1019
00:54:00.454 --> 00:54:02.543
Okay. Okay.

1020
00:54:02.674 --> 00:54:04.850
Call. Okay.

1021
00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:06.199
Okay. Okay.

1022
00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:07.374
<i>Yello?</i>

1023
00:54:07.505 --> 00:54:08.723
Seriously?

1024
00:54:08.854 --> 00:54:10.725
Eight. five.

1025
00:54:16.514 --> 00:54:19.343
Please. please. please. please.
please. please. please.

1026
00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:45.325
<i>Emily?</i>

1027
00:54:45.456 --> 00:54:46.848
<i>Sam?</i>

1028
00:54:46.979 --> 00:54:48.676
<i>You found a phone.</i>

1029
00:54:48.807 --> 00:54:51.026
Thank God.
Are you okay?
<i>Not great.</i>

1030
00:54:51.157 --> 00:54:52.593
<i>I lost my earbud.</i>

1031
00:54:52.724 --> 00:54:54.595
Um. can you get up?
Okay. we got to go.

1032
00:54:54.726 --> 00:54:56.423
We got to do the 360. okay?

1033
00:54:57.598 --> 00:54:59.948
It's dark.

1034
00:55:00.079 --> 00:55:01.472
<i>Now we both can't see.</i>

1035
00:55:01.602 --> 00:55:02.995
Yeah. I can... I can...

1036
00:55:03.125 --> 00:55:04.518
I can still spot his flashlight.
though. right?

1037
00:55:04.649 --> 00:55:07.173
I'm just gonna lay here
until he finds me.

1038
00:55:07.304 --> 00:55:08.870
No. your phone.
it has a flashlight.

1039
00:55:09.001 --> 00:55:11.046
I can walk you through.
uh. turning it on. okay?

1040
00:55:11.177 --> 00:55:13.005
You're just gonna--

1041
00:55:13.135 --> 00:55:15.964
That would just make it
easier for him to spot me.

1042
00:55:16.095 --> 00:55:18.010
Okay. Okay.

1043
00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:20.099
So. um... so. what
are we gonna do?

1044
00:55:20.229 --> 00:55:22.101
Hey.

1045
00:55:22.231 --> 00:55:23.972
- Sam?
- Yeah?

1046
00:55:24.103 --> 00:55:27.541
None of this is
your fault. okay?

1047
00:55:27.672 --> 00:55:29.848
I asked you to do
a pretty impossible thing.

1048
00:55:29.978 --> 00:55:31.719
And I'm sorry.

1049
00:55:31.850 --> 00:55:34.331
No. Emily. No. no. no.
no. you can't. okay?

1050
00:55:34.461 --> 00:55:36.245
I need you to call
someone for me.

1051
00:55:36.376 --> 00:55:39.118
Can you do that. Sam?
No. No. let's just...

1052
00:55:39.248 --> 00:55:41.294
Let's keep going. right?
Let's keep going.

1053
00:55:41.425 --> 00:55:44.558
Call the landline
and put it on speaker.

1054
00:55:44.689 --> 00:55:46.952
No. let's just go.
Okay? Let's just go.

1055
00:55:47.082 --> 00:55:49.955
The number is...

1056
00:55:50.085 --> 00:55:53.306
eight. one. zero.
one. two. six.

1057
00:55:53.437 --> 00:55:56.353
zero. one. nine. seven.

1058
00:56:00.487 --> 00:56:03.490
Hey. I thought you hadn't
memorized any numbers

1059
00:56:03.621 --> 00:56:05.362
since middle school.

1060
00:56:05.492 --> 00:56:07.538
<i>Yeah. well.
sometimes it's easier</i>

1061
00:56:07.668 --> 00:56:10.323
<i>to show a stranger
how much you fucked up.</i>

1062
00:56:12.978 --> 00:56:14.632
Please...

1063
00:56:14.762 --> 00:56:16.982
don't make me ask you again.

1064
00:56:31.953 --> 00:56:33.390
<i>Hello?</i>

1065
00:56:35.914 --> 00:56:37.611
<i>Hi. Mom.</i>

1066
00:56:37.742 --> 00:56:39.918
<i>Em. what's this number
you're calling from?</i>

1067
00:56:40.048 --> 00:56:43.356
My friend's phone.
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

1068
00:56:43.487 --> 00:56:45.010
I'm sorry.

1069
00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:47.578
<i>For what?</i>
I...

1070
00:56:47.708 --> 00:56:50.581
You were right.
and I should've listened to you.

1071
00:56:50.711 --> 00:56:54.236
and I'm... I'm sorry
that I got mad at you.

1072
00:56:54.367 --> 00:56:55.803
<i>What has he done to you?</i>

1073
00:56:55.934 --> 00:56:58.415
<i>Deep down. I think that I knew</i>

1074
00:56:58.545 --> 00:57:02.331
that you were right.
but I indulged anyway.

1075
00:57:02.462 --> 00:57:04.159
<i>Em. where are you?</i>

1076
00:57:04.290 --> 00:57:07.032
<i>I'm sorry that
I didn't come see you more.</i>

1077
00:57:07.162 --> 00:57:08.642
<i>That I didn't take off work.</i>

1078
00:57:10.383 --> 00:57:11.906
<i>I always made excuses.</i>

1079
00:57:12.037 --> 00:57:13.473
<i>I'm going to come get you.</i>

1080
00:57:13.604 --> 00:57:15.170
<i>Just tell me where you are.</i>

1081
00:57:15.301 --> 00:57:17.259
I love you so much. Mom.

1082
00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:19.261
<i>Tell me where you are. Em.</i>

1083
00:57:19.392 --> 00:57:21.786
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1084
00:57:21.916 --> 00:57:24.528
<i>Thank you for everything.
Thank you for...</i>

1085
00:57:24.658 --> 00:57:27.618
<i>for making me strong.
and I'm sorry.</i>

1086
00:57:27.748 --> 00:57:30.490
<i>Emily. tell me what's going on.</i>

1087
00:57:30.621 --> 00:57:34.015
<i>This is probably the last time
that we're gonna...</i>

1088
00:57:35.016 --> 00:57:35.930
A light.

1089
00:57:36.061 --> 00:57:37.802
Emily.

1090
00:57:37.932 --> 00:57:41.022
<i>Emily. there's a light.</i>

1091
00:57:41.153 --> 00:57:42.589
<i>A light went on behind you.
okay?</i>

1092
00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:43.982
<i>It could be a house.</i>

1093
00:57:44.112 --> 00:57:45.549
<i>Em. what's happening?</i>

1094
00:57:45.679 --> 00:57:47.246
<i>We can get to it. It's not far.</i>

1095
00:57:47.376 --> 00:57:49.291
I don't know.

1096
00:57:49.422 --> 00:57:51.293
Just get up. okay?

1097
00:57:51.424 --> 00:57:52.817
Just get up.

1098
00:57:52.947 --> 00:57:55.428
<i>I can barely stand now. Sam.</i>

1099
00:57:58.649 --> 00:58:00.346
Emily.

1100
00:58:01.956 --> 00:58:04.045
You know how...

1101
00:58:04.176 --> 00:58:07.266
You know how you said
that you're sure...

1102
00:58:07.396 --> 00:58:09.486
you're so sure
that my mom was happy

1103
00:58:09.616 --> 00:58:11.531
I was there with her
when she passed?

1104
00:58:11.662 --> 00:58:13.620
Yeah.

1105
00:58:16.231 --> 00:58:18.843
I wasn't there.

1106
00:58:18.973 --> 00:58:20.932
Okay. I needed...
I needed a break.

1107
00:58:21.062 --> 00:58:22.934
I needed a break from her
and from her sickness.

1108
00:58:23.064 --> 00:58:24.762
and so I went out
and I got drunk.

1109
00:58:24.892 --> 00:58:27.678
and I left and...

1110
00:58:27.808 --> 00:58:29.810
By the time
I got back home. I...

1111
00:58:30.985 --> 00:58:32.770
Shit.

1112
00:58:34.946 --> 00:58:38.166
I left her. and she...

1113
00:58:38.297 --> 00:58:40.647
<i>died. okay?</i>

1114
00:58:40.778 --> 00:58:43.476
<i>And I wanted
to leave you tonight. too.</i>

1115
00:58:43.607 --> 00:58:45.652
<i>so bad. okay?</i>

1116
00:58:45.783 --> 00:58:48.002
<i>I was... scared.</i>

1117
00:58:48.133 --> 00:58:52.311
But you. you asked me to stay.

1118
00:58:52.441 --> 00:58:55.270
Okay? So I stayed. right?

1119
00:58:55.401 --> 00:58:57.142
And now what? What?

1120
00:58:57.272 --> 00:59:00.885
You're just gonna...
you're gonna give up?

1121
00:59:01.015 --> 00:59:03.888
No. no.
No. you are not allowed. okay?

1122
00:59:04.018 --> 00:59:07.544
<i>You. you are not allowed
to give up.</i>

1123
00:59:07.674 --> 00:59:09.241
<i>Em. who is that?</i>

1124
00:59:10.938 --> 00:59:12.244
It's Sam. Mom.

1125
00:59:12.374 --> 00:59:14.551
<i>Who's Sam?</i>
She's my friend.

1126
00:59:14.681 --> 00:59:18.555
<i>Oh. Then listen to Sam.</i>

1127
00:59:18.685 --> 00:59:20.121
<i>Goddamn it. get up. Em. get up!</i>

1128
00:59:20.252 --> 00:59:21.253
Just get up.

1129
00:59:21.383 --> 00:59:22.428
I can't.

1130
00:59:22.559 --> 00:59:24.299
Get up.

1131
00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:25.649
<i>Get up.</i>
<i>Emily.
you can do it.</i>

1132
00:59:25.779 --> 00:59:27.215
He's gonna find me
no matter what I do.

1133
00:59:27.346 --> 00:59:28.826
He's gonna...
he's gonna find me.

1134
00:59:28.956 --> 00:59:30.654
<i>No. no.
Emily. I'm not gonna leave you.</i>

1135
00:59:30.784 --> 00:59:32.177
<i>Just get up.</i>
<i>Come on. honey.
Get up.</i>

1136
00:59:32.307 --> 00:59:35.441
Okay. you just...
you just have to get up.

1137
00:59:35.572 --> 00:59:38.400
<i>Okay? I am right here.
I didn't leave.</i>

1138
00:59:38.531 --> 00:59:39.750
I'm right here.

1139
00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:41.578
Okay? Go. Just get up.

1140
00:59:42.666 --> 00:59:44.102
<i>Just get up. please.</i>

1141
00:59:44.232 --> 00:59:46.626
Is there really a light?

1142
00:59:46.757 --> 00:59:49.281
Yes. yes. yes.
<i>You can
do this. okay?</i>

1143
00:59:49.411 --> 00:59:51.065
<i>Listen to your friend.
She's gonna help you.</i>

1144
00:59:51.196 --> 00:59:53.067
<i>Just come home.</i>

1145
00:59:53.198 --> 00:59:54.503
I think maybe I see it.

1146
00:59:54.634 --> 00:59:56.680
<i>It's there. Okay. trust me.</i>

1147
00:59:56.810 --> 00:59:58.725
Okay.

1148
00:59:58.856 --> 01:00:00.945
Okay. Sam.

1149
01:00:01.075 --> 01:00:02.816
Lead me to the light.

1150
01:00:02.947 --> 01:00:04.731
<i>Yes! Honey. go.</i>

1151
01:00:04.862 --> 01:00:06.385
<i>You can do it.</i>

1152
01:00:20.921 --> 01:00:22.619
Sam?

1153
01:00:22.749 --> 01:00:26.448
<i>Yeah. we're almost there.
Just keep going.</i>

1154
01:00:26.579 --> 01:00:28.363
<i>I see it. Right up ahead.</i>

1155
01:00:28.494 --> 01:00:30.931
What is it?
<i>It's a barn.</i>

1156
01:00:31.062 --> 01:00:33.586
<i>Okay. let's see if there's
a house nearby. Scan.</i>

1157
01:00:33.717 --> 01:00:34.805
Okay.

1158
01:00:35.849 --> 01:00:37.155
Shit.

1159
01:00:37.285 --> 01:00:38.678
I see his flashlight.
Turn around.

1160
01:00:38.809 --> 01:00:40.288
Get in the barn.

1161
01:00:41.594 --> 01:00:43.770
<i>Straight. It's in front of you.</i>

1162
01:00:48.732 --> 01:00:50.559
All right. what do you see?

1163
01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:51.996
I need a weapon.

1164
01:00:52.126 --> 01:00:55.086
Uh. I see hay. shelves.

1165
01:00:55.216 --> 01:00:57.392
some-some sort of chemicals.

1166
01:00:57.523 --> 01:01:00.700
um. uh. uh. stairs going up.

1167
01:01:00.831 --> 01:01:03.137
What. no pitchfork? Axe? Gun?

1168
01:01:03.268 --> 01:01:05.096
No. No. not yet.

1169
01:01:05.226 --> 01:01:07.315
God. What else is there?

1170
01:01:11.624 --> 01:01:13.191
What is that?

1171
01:01:24.202 --> 01:01:25.943
What the fuck?

1172
01:01:54.406 --> 01:01:56.800
<i>Sam. what's wrong?</i>

1173
01:02:00.978 --> 01:02:02.196
Sam.

1174
01:02:02.327 --> 01:02:03.763
He's close.

1175
01:02:03.894 --> 01:02:05.025
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

1176
01:02:06.984 --> 01:02:09.116
Sam. are you there? Hello?

1177
01:02:09.247 --> 01:02:10.465
Shit.

1178
01:02:10.596 --> 01:02:12.293
Okay. You need to hide. <i>Okay.</i>

1179
01:02:12.424 --> 01:02:14.905
All right. which way?
Anything look good?

1180
01:02:15.035 --> 01:02:16.428
<i>Um. go to your...
go to your right.</i>

1181
01:02:16.558 --> 01:02:17.951
<i>Your right. behind that shelf.</i>

1182
01:02:27.874 --> 01:02:29.310
<i>Sam? Hello?</i>

1183
01:02:29.441 --> 01:02:32.226
<i>Is there anything here?</i>

1184
01:02:32.357 --> 01:02:33.924
<i>Hello? Sam.</i>

1185
01:02:37.884 --> 01:02:39.973
Holy shit.
What?

1186
01:02:45.239 --> 01:02:47.154
Oh. God.
<i>What happened?
What happened?</i>

1187
01:02:49.461 --> 01:02:52.333
Let us in. little bitch.

1188
01:02:52.464 --> 01:02:53.726
Go away!

1189
01:02:53.857 --> 01:02:56.816
Sam. what is happening
over there?

1190
01:02:56.947 --> 01:02:58.862
Open this fucking door!

1191
01:02:58.992 --> 01:03:00.689
There-there is a couple here.

1192
01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:03.823
and. well. they...
they have guns.

1193
01:03:03.954 --> 01:03:05.694
What do you... what do you mean.
they have guns?

1194
01:03:05.825 --> 01:03:07.131
I took this woman's phone

1195
01:03:07.261 --> 01:03:09.089
to call you. and...
Let us in!

1196
01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:10.917
...her and her husband.
well. they are not

1197
01:03:11.048 --> 01:03:12.745
happy about it. okay?

1198
01:03:12.876 --> 01:03:15.530
You ruined my <i>fête de yacht!</i>

1199
01:03:15.661 --> 01:03:17.706
Oh. my God.
You will pay
for that!

1200
01:03:17.837 --> 01:03:21.275
<i>Sam. if they have guns.
you have to call the police.</i>

1201
01:03:21.406 --> 01:03:24.670
No. no. no. no. I really...
I really did steal the phone.

1202
01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:27.064
so. um. you know. if. uh...
if I call the police.

1203
01:03:27.194 --> 01:03:28.717
they're gonna come
and they're gonna...

1204
01:03:28.848 --> 01:03:29.980
<i>they would take it away
from me.</i>

1205
01:03:30.110 --> 01:03:31.503
<i>I need you safe first.</i>

1206
01:03:31.633 --> 01:03:33.157
Move back.
Okay. baby.

1207
01:03:38.162 --> 01:03:39.728
Oh. shit.

1208
01:03:42.993 --> 01:03:43.994
Sam.

1209
01:03:47.301 --> 01:03:49.260
What happened? What happened?
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

1210
01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:51.131
I just. um...
Uh. why don't you. uh.

1211
01:03:51.262 --> 01:03:52.480
keep showing me
the shelves. okay?

1212
01:03:52.611 --> 01:03:53.655
Just show me the shelves.

1213
01:03:53.786 --> 01:03:54.874
<i>Okay.</i>

1214
01:03:55.005 --> 01:03:56.397
<i>Okay. Anything here?</i>

1215
01:03:56.528 --> 01:03:57.834
No. no. no. Nothing.

1216
01:04:02.012 --> 01:04:03.404
Give me the phone.

1217
01:04:03.535 --> 01:04:05.363
Give her the phone back!
Give us the phone!

1218
01:04:05.493 --> 01:04:08.235
You want to catch one
right between the eyes?

1219
01:04:10.411 --> 01:04:11.935
<i>Give her
the fucking phone back!</i>

1220
01:04:12.065 --> 01:04:13.675
<i>Give us the phone!</i>

1221
01:04:13.806 --> 01:04:16.069
Look at you.
you fucking ugly piece of shit!

1222
01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.636

What in God's green fuck
is going on here?

1229
01:04:38.091 --> 01:04:39.527

She's been nothing
but a nuisance.

1237
01:04:54.194 --> 01:04:55.630
I never should've hired her.

1238
01:04:55.761 --> 01:04:56.936

I'm so sorry. ma'am.
Let's go!

- I can mute myself.
- What?

1269
01:05:55.038 --> 01:05:56.735
But-but how will I know
when it's time?

1270
01:05:56.865 --> 01:05:59.390
No. no. no. I will send you
a text when he's in the spot.

1271
01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:01.000
You'll hear a ping.

1272
01:06:01.131 --> 01:06:02.741
But what if he doesn't go
to the spot. Sam?

1273
01:06:02.871 --> 01:06:04.656
I can't know what's happening

1274
01:06:04.786 --> 01:06:06.788
if you can't talk to me.
Hey. hey. We just
have to trust

1275
01:06:06.919 --> 01:06:08.355
that it's gonna work.
But-but-but...

1276
01:06:08.486 --> 01:06:09.878
Just. I have to
mute myself. okay?

1277
01:06:11.141 --> 01:06:12.577
- No.
- This is gonna work.

1278
01:06:12.707 --> 01:06:14.405
It's gonna work. okay?

01:12:46.492 --> 01:12:48.276
And I was just wondering. um.

1333
01:12:48.407 --> 01:12:50.148

on your offer

1334
01:12:50.278 --> 01:12:51.410
