00:00:43.477 --> 00:00:45.013
<i>Another glorious morning.</i>

4
00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:46.648
<i>It's a good surfing day.</i>

5
00:00:46.814 --> 00:00:49.817
<i>Just put on your sunscreen</i>
<i>and head off.</i>

6
00:00:49.984 --> 00:00:51.451
<i>Isn't it good to be alive?</i>

7
00:02:56.711 --> 00:02:58.012
Thanks. mate.

8
00:02:58.146 --> 00:02:59.681
- Just put it here?
- Yeah. cool.

9
00:02:59.814 --> 00:03:01.181
Mate.
I'm in deep shit.

10
00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:02.784
Well.
that's unusual.

11
00:03:06.621 --> 00:03:08.288
Look. you know
that car Pete got me.

12
00:03:08.422 --> 00:03:11.425
it's still hot.
I need to flog it quick.

13
00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:14.194
So talk to Pete.
He'll move it.

14
00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:17.031
I can't. I still owe him
a hundred grand
off the last job.

15
00:03:17.165 --> 00:03:18.633
That's why I'm asking you.

16
00:03:18.766 --> 00:03:20.668
Rick. I haven't got
a hundred grand.

17
00:03:20.802 --> 00:03:22.904
I'm gonna be straight up.
you're causing me grief
with my girl.

18
00:03:23.037 --> 00:03:25.439
And how many times do you need
to hear I've got a fucking job?

19
00:03:25.573 --> 00:03:26.808
I've given that game away.

20
00:03:26.941 --> 00:03:28.643
One favor.
That's all I'm asking.

21
00:03:28.776 --> 00:03:30.111
Pete treats you
like a son.

22
00:03:31.012 --> 00:03:32.680
We can go and see him
together. talk to him.

23
00:03:32.814 --> 00:03:34.247
Give me time
to repay the debt

24
00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:37.518
and then I'm out
of your life. Deal?

25
00:03:37.652 --> 00:03:39.453
You mean you're conning me
into this?

26
00:03:40.755 --> 00:03:42.255
So if I support you
on this one.

27
00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:43.658
you leave me alone.
Okay?

28
00:03:43.791 --> 00:03:45.358
Well. fuck it. Sean.
I'll owe you one.

29
00:03:45.492 --> 00:03:47.227
So tomorrow night.
'round seven.

30
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.964
I'll pick you up. we'll go
and see Pete together.
Okay?

31
00:04:01.075 --> 00:04:02.409
- Hey.
- Hey.

32
00:04:02.543 --> 00:04:03.811
I'll see you
in five.

33
00:04:03.945 --> 00:04:05.646
- Okay.
- Hmm.

34
00:05:45.746 --> 00:05:47.748
Well. seriously.
how does he do that?

35
00:05:47.882 --> 00:05:50.952
Practice and dedication.

36
00:05:53.554 --> 00:05:55.957
Didn't you ever want to surf
like your friends?

37
00:05:57.124 --> 00:05:58.092
I tried.

38
00:05:59.227 --> 00:06:00.728
Life kept getting
in the way.

39
00:06:00.862 --> 00:06:04.599
You were there
when Sean's dad
was murdered.

40
00:06:06.133 --> 00:06:08.102
Still have flashbacks
about it.

41
00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:12.874
And Robbie. well.
he just closed down.

42
00:06:13.007 --> 00:06:15.142
They were very close
and. after it happened.

43
00:06:15.276 --> 00:06:17.945
he just left town
and I didn't see him
for years.

44
00:06:19.446 --> 00:06:20.948
And what about Sean?

45
00:06:22.884 --> 00:06:24.785
Sean.

46
00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:27.021
Imagine having to grow up
in orphanages.

47
00:06:27.154 --> 00:06:29.824
your father murdered.
deserted by your Mum.

48
00:06:31.192 --> 00:06:32.760
I worry about him.

49
00:06:32.894 --> 00:06:34.929
and Jack tells me
he's easily influenced

50
00:06:35.062 --> 00:06:37.497
and hangs out
with the wrong sort.

51
00:06:41.002 --> 00:06:43.905
That's why I think
you're good for him.

52
00:06:44.038 --> 00:06:45.339
He'll come around.

53
00:06:45.472 --> 00:06:48.809
Yeah...
Yeah. he will.

54
00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.551
Oh. wow.

55
00:06:58.386 --> 00:06:59.620
I mean. it's just--

56
00:06:59.754 --> 00:07:01.255
it's so graceful.
you know?

57
00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:04.258
I call it liquid ballet.

58
00:07:04.392 --> 00:07:07.561
"Liquid ballet." Nice.

59
00:08:08.089 --> 00:08:10.858
This is--
this is just a block of wood.

60
00:08:12.326 --> 00:08:14.161
No. but look at that.

61
00:08:14.295 --> 00:08:16.230
It's the real deal.

62
00:08:17.098 --> 00:08:20.334
- It's a real table.
- We used to ride this.

63
00:08:26.674 --> 00:08:28.109
Hey. hey.

64
00:08:28.242 --> 00:08:30.111
It's so good to see the Dads
enjoying themselves.

65
00:08:30.244 --> 00:08:31.712
Mm.

66
00:08:31.846 --> 00:08:34.015
I've gotta get to work.
I'll see you at the club.

67
00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:37.418
See you there.

68
00:08:37.551 --> 00:08:39.086
See you. Katie.

69
00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:40.888
I heard about that.
That was brilliant.

70
00:08:41.022 --> 00:08:42.123
Hey. boys.

71
00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:44.992
G'day. mate. hey.
I had one just like that.

72
00:08:45.126 --> 00:08:46.427
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

73
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.863
Until a rock jumped out
at Burleigh and ate it.

74
00:08:48.996 --> 00:08:50.331
Yeah. it's true.

75
00:08:50.464 --> 00:08:51.499
Sounds like you. Dad.

76
00:08:51.632 --> 00:08:52.867
Memories. eh?

77
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.201
Clay.

78
00:08:57.338 --> 00:08:58.406
What up. Pops?

79
00:08:58.539 --> 00:08:59.874
Hey. mate.

80
00:09:00.141 --> 00:09:01.742
- Digging the vibe.
- You know what?

81
00:09:01.876 --> 00:09:05.913
Boo would've absolutely
loved this museum.

82
00:09:06.047 --> 00:09:09.850
Thirty years. right.
since he was murdered?

83
00:09:11.719 --> 00:09:13.522
Seriously?

84
00:09:13.654 --> 00:09:15.689
I'll wait
for you guys outside.

85
00:09:15.823 --> 00:09:17.792
Hang on. mate.
We'll come with you.

86
00:09:25.199 --> 00:09:26.467
You guys see that?

87
00:09:27.268 --> 00:09:30.037
Those old boys
must really miss
their mate.

88
00:09:30.171 --> 00:09:33.542
We could do a tribute.
Sean. for your Dad.

89
00:09:33.674 --> 00:09:36.043
- It's not a bad idea.
- Yeah?

90
00:09:40.549 --> 00:09:42.783
Yeah. yeah.
we can do that.

91
00:09:56.163 --> 00:09:57.264
You okay?

92
00:10:00.234 --> 00:10:02.571
Yeah. yeah. I'm great.

93
00:10:02.703 --> 00:10:04.705
Hey. um...

94
00:10:06.173 --> 00:10:08.909
I forgot to ask.
how was work today?

95
00:10:09.043 --> 00:10:13.013
- Oh. it was okay.
It's fine.
- Oh. okay.

96
00:10:15.049 --> 00:10:18.085
What were you and Rick
talking about at the club?

97
00:10:20.754 --> 00:10:24.091
Well. he wants me
to go and see Pete.

98
00:10:24.225 --> 00:10:27.895
You know I owe him aft--
after Dad died.

99
00:10:29.163 --> 00:10:30.197
And?

100
00:10:34.435 --> 00:10:36.470
Rick will drag you down.

101
00:10:36.605 --> 00:10:39.473
I saw the way that you didn't
want anything to do
with him at the club.

102
00:10:39.608 --> 00:10:41.709
You've got to trust that.

103
00:10:44.245 --> 00:10:48.182
We're so good now.
You're so good now.

104
00:10:55.624 --> 00:10:57.658
I'm really proud of you.

105
00:10:58.459 --> 00:10:59.260
Really?

106
00:10:59.393 --> 00:11:01.228
Yeah. Really.

107
00:11:03.532 --> 00:11:05.866
Mm.

108
00:11:12.806 --> 00:11:14.008
Um...

109
00:11:15.242 --> 00:11:17.811
Clay and the other guys. they--
they want me to go on a--

110
00:11:17.945 --> 00:11:20.481
a tribute trip to Austinville
to honor my Dad.

111
00:11:20.615 --> 00:11:22.651
You should do it.

112
00:11:22.783 --> 00:11:25.520
- Yeah. I'd love to come.
- Yeah?

113
00:11:25.654 --> 00:11:27.821
They mentioned
it's just the sons.

114
00:11:29.223 --> 00:11:33.861
But I promise
when I come back. I...

115
00:11:34.762 --> 00:11:36.363
am gonna take you...

116
00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:39.967
somewhere special.

117
00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:52.780
Just here. with you.

118
00:12:37.458 --> 00:12:39.793
- Yep.
<i>- Hey. Jack.</i>

119
00:12:39.927 --> 00:12:42.896
We decided to do
a tribute run to Austinville
in memory of Sean's Dad.

120
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:44.965
- You in?
- I'll pass.

121
00:12:45.099 --> 00:12:47.968
<i>Let's twist it.</i>
<i>If it was you. he'd be there</i>
<i>for your Dad.</i>

122
00:12:48.102 --> 00:12:49.937
Trust me on this.
I'll owe you.

123
00:12:52.072 --> 00:12:54.074
Yeah. leave it with me.

124
00:12:54.208 --> 00:12:56.076
So tomorrow at the cave?
Early?

125
00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.379
Done deal.
We'll see you there.

126
00:13:29.577 --> 00:13:31.979
- Hey. mate. how are you?
- Good. mate.
Good. mate.

127
00:13:32.112 --> 00:13:35.583
- Had good waves lately?
- Uh. it's getting better.

128
00:13:35.717 --> 00:13:37.951
Let's. uh.
let's go inside.

129
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.797
All right. Pete.
you know why I called.

130
00:13:48.929 --> 00:13:50.998
Rick needs a favor.

131
00:13:51.131 --> 00:13:52.534
You know Dominic Cooper?

132
00:13:54.068 --> 00:13:56.403
Yeah.
we've done business.

133
00:13:56.538 --> 00:13:59.473
Well. I happen to know he has
got a tidy little shipment
coming in by sea.

134
00:13:59.607 --> 00:14:01.308
Well. no surprises there.

135
00:14:01.442 --> 00:14:03.077
but what's that
got to do with me?

136
00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:05.879
Well. I owe you. don't I?
This will take care of it.

137
00:14:07.981 --> 00:14:10.451
Plus you both know
I really need the cash.

138
00:14:10.585 --> 00:14:14.188
- Pete. you understand?
- Oh. you bet I do.

139
00:14:14.321 --> 00:14:15.923
So when are you
gonna fix me up?

140
00:14:16.056 --> 00:14:18.025
Well. that's what I'm saying.
Borrow the shipment.

141
00:14:18.158 --> 00:14:21.061
get you your cash.
get Sean his cut

142
00:14:21.195 --> 00:14:23.397
and I get
those other assholes
off my back.

143
00:14:24.699 --> 00:14:27.868
So you're saying you're gonna
knock off this shipment
to repay your debts?

144
00:14:28.001 --> 00:14:28.936
Mine included?

145
00:14:29.069 --> 00:14:30.805
Great.
Everybody happy.

146
00:14:30.938 --> 00:14:32.841
Hang on.

147
00:14:32.973 --> 00:14:34.875
This sounds fucking dangerous.

148
00:14:35.008 --> 00:14:37.111
Come on. mate.
You're going soft.

149
00:14:37.244 --> 00:14:40.047
Look. all I'm saying is.
we'll go and check it out.

150
00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:42.684
If it looks too heavy.
we'll cancel.

151
00:14:42.817 --> 00:14:44.552
But Sean. I'm telling you.
mate.

152
00:14:44.686 --> 00:14:46.887
this is the only way
you and I get out ahead.

153
00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:50.558
I promised Katie
no more shit.

154
00:14:50.692 --> 00:14:52.259
Yeah. I get it. kid.

155
00:14:53.528 --> 00:14:55.062
Your call.

156
00:14:55.195 --> 00:14:58.999
Look. if it's a no.
I'll accept. but if it's
a go show.

157
00:14:59.133 --> 00:15:01.736
mate. you're gonna need
an alibi.

158
00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:04.371
Well. that's not an issue.
Sean's got his surfing mates.

159
00:15:04.506 --> 00:15:05.774
Great!

160
00:15:06.808 --> 00:15:09.511
So when the shipment comes in.
I'll go check it out

161
00:15:09.644 --> 00:15:10.911
and then we'll decide.

162
00:15:11.912 --> 00:15:13.347
Okay?

163
00:15:14.716 --> 00:15:18.887
Come on. mate.
Last one. for me.
promise.

164
00:17:20.642 --> 00:17:22.710
Good evening.
all you freeloaders.

165
00:17:24.044 --> 00:17:26.380
I'm just kidding. folks.

166
00:17:26.514 --> 00:17:29.049
I'd like to thank
each and every one of you

167
00:17:29.182 --> 00:17:30.652
for coming to my home tonight.

168
00:17:30.785 --> 00:17:34.956
My gorgeous niece. April.
has decided to marry Tim

169
00:17:35.088 --> 00:17:40.595
and Tim has committed to spend
the rest of his life with April

170
00:17:40.728 --> 00:17:42.429
and I'll make sure
that he'll do that.

171
00:17:42.564 --> 00:17:44.131
So look.

172
00:17:44.264 --> 00:17:47.669
let's all raise a toast
to the happy couple.

173
00:17:47.802 --> 00:17:49.637
Cheers!

174
00:18:10.725 --> 00:18:12.125
Katie!

175
00:18:12.259 --> 00:18:14.428
Katie. come and join me.

176
00:18:32.112 --> 00:18:34.849
April mentioned
that you might be looking
for. uh. work?

177
00:18:34.983 --> 00:18:36.416
Oh. I was. yeah.

178
00:18:36.551 --> 00:18:38.820
but I've got a good gig now
at the surf club.

179
00:18:38.953 --> 00:18:42.924
Did she mentioned to you
that I've got loan shops
all over the place.

180
00:18:43.057 --> 00:18:45.093
and a lot of people
are looking for a loan

181
00:18:45.225 --> 00:18:46.894
and I'm always looking
for staff...

182
00:18:48.161 --> 00:18:50.364
Managers. Here...

183
00:18:50.497 --> 00:18:54.134
So. give me a call.

184
00:19:14.055 --> 00:19:17.792
You know what?
I'm thinking that maybe
you and I. you know. later.

185
00:19:17.925 --> 00:19:19.226
we could get together.

186
00:19:19.359 --> 00:19:21.495
talk about you
and your future plans.

187
00:19:21.629 --> 00:19:24.164
and. uh. what do you say?
Over-over a nightcap?

188
00:19:24.297 --> 00:19:27.367
Mm. I have a very big day
surf club-wise.

189
00:19:27.502 --> 00:19:29.737
but. um. maybe
some other time.

190
00:19:32.472 --> 00:19:34.408
- I got to take that.
- Mm.

191
00:19:35.375 --> 00:19:36.644
Yeah. Talk to me.

192
00:19:36.778 --> 00:19:38.278
I'm gonna go. Bye.

193
00:19:38.412 --> 00:19:40.915
Okay. thanks.
Call me.

194
00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.034
Dom.

195
00:21:52.113 --> 00:21:53.815
We're lucky that car flies.

196
00:21:53.948 --> 00:21:55.315
We?

197
00:21:55.448 --> 00:21:58.719
So this was
some easy-peasy boost.
was it?

198
00:21:58.853 --> 00:22:01.289
Just drop me
at Kane's house.

199
00:22:34.255 --> 00:22:36.389
Kane. I'm out the front.
Have you-have you got a sec?

200
00:22:36.524 --> 00:22:39.060
What. what time is it?

201
00:22:40.094 --> 00:22:41.394
Just give me a minute.

202
00:22:53.107 --> 00:22:54.407
Mate. I'm in trouble.

203
00:22:54.542 --> 00:22:56.611
For fuck's sake. Sean.
What happened?

204
00:22:56.744 --> 00:22:59.881
Rick. He was in debt
and he owed Pete
and I helped out.

205
00:23:00.014 --> 00:23:01.315
I need an alibi.

206
00:23:01.448 --> 00:23:03.017
I thought you wiped
that shonky bastard.

207
00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:06.587
I did. but Pete asked me
to help one last time.
I owe him.

208
00:23:06.721 --> 00:23:08.923
We boosted a drug shipment.

209
00:23:12.126 --> 00:23:12.960
Fuck.

210
00:23:13.094 --> 00:23:15.830
Yeah. it gets worse.

211
00:23:17.765 --> 00:23:20.735
Katie. If she finds out.
she's going to walk.

212
00:23:20.868 --> 00:23:24.471
Yeah. man. I like Katie.
She's a keeper.

213
00:23:24.605 --> 00:23:28.109
Yeah. she really is
the best thing
that ever happened to me.

214
00:23:28.242 --> 00:23:30.511
That life
that I used to live.
it's finished.

215
00:23:30.645 --> 00:23:32.213
I did this for Pete
as one last job.

216
00:23:32.346 --> 00:23:34.081
He looked after me
for years.

217
00:23:35.549 --> 00:23:37.652
Rick conned me again.

218
00:23:39.587 --> 00:23:41.188
Mate...

219
00:23:42.056 --> 00:23:44.825
can I stay here
on your couch
just for tonight?

220
00:23:44.959 --> 00:23:48.729
Yeah. yeah. Sure. mate.
I'll-- I'll just get a rug.

221
00:25:27.261 --> 00:25:28.896
Frank. what's up?

222
00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:31.198
<i>- I've got a lead.</i>
- Well?

223
00:25:31.332 --> 00:25:33.267
That chick
you were talking
to at the party.

224
00:25:33.401 --> 00:25:35.636
- she definitely
knows something.
<i>- Crap.</i>

225
00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:40.808
<i>You tell me</i>
<i>you found that mother</i>
<i>who's ripped me off.</i>

226
00:25:40.941 --> 00:25:43.277
Stay with me on this.
I need more info
on the chick--

227
00:25:43.411 --> 00:25:47.314
name. address.
who she knows.
where she works.

228
00:25:47.448 --> 00:25:48.916
She works at the surf club.

229
00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:52.453
<i>You can get the information</i>
<i>from them.</i>

230
00:25:52.586 --> 00:25:53.854
<i>and I'm warning you. Frank.</i>

231
00:25:53.988 --> 00:25:57.558
You better find my drugs.

232
00:26:01.695 --> 00:26:03.264
Or what?

233
00:26:04.632 --> 00:26:07.201
Piece of shit.

234
00:26:11.405 --> 00:26:12.773
Coming.

235
00:26:15.876 --> 00:26:19.413
Morning. Sean.
A car was stolen
from Varsity Lakes

236
00:26:19.548 --> 00:26:22.249
and the camera scans show
a distinct likeness to you.

237
00:26:22.383 --> 00:26:25.086
same build and size.
and with your record.

238
00:26:25.219 --> 00:26:27.088
we thought we'd come
and check it out.

239
00:26:28.122 --> 00:26:30.758
Where were you
on the 15th at 9:00 PM?

240
00:26:30.891 --> 00:26:31.992
Well. I was with a mate.

241
00:26:32.126 --> 00:26:35.096
And he or she
can confirm that?

242
00:26:35.229 --> 00:26:36.397
Of course.

243
00:26:36.531 --> 00:26:37.698
You gonna give me a name?

244
00:26:37.832 --> 00:26:39.967
Do you not believe me
or something?

245
00:26:40.101 --> 00:26:42.369
Come on. Sean.
I've got a camera likeness.

246
00:26:42.504 --> 00:26:45.139
I can hold you on suspicion
and you know that.

247
00:26:45.272 --> 00:26:47.708
Maybe it's best
you just come down
to the station.

248
00:26:47.842 --> 00:26:50.244
We can check
your alibi from there.

249
00:26:50.377 --> 00:26:53.515
All right.
I'm just gonna tell
my girl first.

250
00:26:53.647 --> 00:26:55.749
You can make that call
from the station.

251
00:26:58.587 --> 00:27:00.821
- Okay.
- Let's go.

252
00:27:19.006 --> 00:27:22.577
Lauren. um. listen.
Sean's in trouble again.

253
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:25.012
Katie! God.
what this time?

254
00:27:25.146 --> 00:27:27.214
Can you do me a big. big favor

255
00:27:27.348 --> 00:27:29.950
and use those legal skills
of yours?

256
00:27:30.084 --> 00:27:32.987
Okay. Don't worry.
I'm on it.

257
00:27:33.154 --> 00:27:35.022
<i>I'll let you know</i>
<i>when it's done.</i>

258
00:27:35.156 --> 00:27:36.724
Thank you.

259
00:29:48.422 --> 00:29:50.692
Hey. mate.
where's Kane?

260
00:29:50.824 --> 00:29:53.093
Work. He's behind
on boards to shape.

261
00:29:55.396 --> 00:29:58.132
Look. man. the trip?
I might have to work.

262
00:30:02.403 --> 00:30:03.871
Look. with Sean.
you know the drill.

263
00:30:04.004 --> 00:30:05.839
We just--
we don't hit it off.

264
00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:08.677
He's got his demons.

265
00:30:08.809 --> 00:30:11.845
It's his MO.
always in the shit.

266
00:30:13.615 --> 00:30:15.149
Trip's still on. Jack.

267
00:30:19.721 --> 00:30:21.121
Come on. mate.

268
00:30:21.255 --> 00:30:23.023
Hit the waves.
Time out with your mates.

269
00:30:23.157 --> 00:30:24.626
Bit of history
for our Dads.

270
00:30:24.759 --> 00:30:26.661
Been too darn long.

271
00:30:26.795 --> 00:30:28.763
Just give me some time.

272
00:30:28.896 --> 00:30:30.397
Your call. Jack.

273
00:32:18.272 --> 00:32:21.543
Yeah. I'll let you know.
Okay. Bye. bye.

274
00:32:23.477 --> 00:32:25.179
He's all yours.

275
00:32:28.482 --> 00:32:31.218
So. Sean.

276
00:32:31.351 --> 00:32:33.053
Sean. don't walk away
from me.

277
00:32:33.187 --> 00:32:35.055
- Look. it's fine.
It was nothing.
- This is not nothing.

278
00:32:35.189 --> 00:32:37.057
You're lucky I know
that detective.

279
00:32:37.191 --> 00:32:38.192
Your alibi is paper thin.

280
00:32:38.325 --> 00:32:40.227
Well. it's gonna hold.

281
00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:43.430
I know you've been hanging
with your old crew
and I really don't care.

282
00:32:43.565 --> 00:32:46.701
but I care about Katie.
and you should too.

283
00:32:46.835 --> 00:32:48.135
I care.

284
00:32:48.268 --> 00:32:49.970
You're up to your neck
in this shit.

285
00:32:50.103 --> 00:32:51.338
There's gonna be
consequences.

286
00:32:51.472 --> 00:32:53.207
Well. I can look
after myself. all right?

287
00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:55.610
Do you ever care about anyone
other than yourself?

288
00:32:57.277 --> 00:33:00.615
Look. Katie means
the world to me.

289
00:33:00.748 --> 00:33:02.382
I would do anything for her.

290
00:33:04.151 --> 00:33:07.522
Hmm.
Thank you.

291
00:33:08.623 --> 00:33:11.626
This is the last time
I bail you out. Sean.

292
00:33:11.759 --> 00:33:13.227
The last time.

293
00:33:30.979 --> 00:33:32.647
- Lauren.
<i>- Katie. I got him out.</i>

294
00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:34.616
Lauren. I don't know
how to thank you.

295
00:33:34.782 --> 00:33:36.350
<i>I've got your back.</i>
<i>sister.</i>

296
00:33:36.483 --> 00:33:38.820
- I owe you.
<i>- I'll add it to the tab.</i>

297
00:33:38.953 --> 00:33:40.555
Bye.

298
00:33:51.566 --> 00:33:52.667
Oh. hey!

299
00:33:53.467 --> 00:33:55.202
Do you ever
check your phone. Kane?

300
00:33:56.169 --> 00:33:57.872
Oh. shit.
Margo Robbie again.

301
00:33:58.006 --> 00:33:59.874
- She must be
after her new board.
- Yeah. You wish.

302
00:34:00.008 --> 00:34:03.110
Sorry. guys. I've been
a bit behind on orders.

303
00:34:03.243 --> 00:34:05.112
- Ready to rock and roll?
- Yeah.

304
00:34:06.113 --> 00:34:08.482
Wow. What's the story?

305
00:34:09.483 --> 00:34:11.285
Set it up on the weekend.

306
00:34:11.418 --> 00:34:13.688
Tribute to our Dads
back in the day.

307
00:34:20.193 --> 00:34:22.062
Check out the boards.

308
00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:24.364
Oh. look at Boo.

309
00:34:24.498 --> 00:34:26.500
Dad reckons
he loved that board.

310
00:34:27.501 --> 00:34:31.039
Oh. and Scollop!
The girls loved him.

311
00:34:31.171 --> 00:34:33.875
Still do.

312
00:34:34.008 --> 00:34:36.443
So. guys...

313
00:34:36.578 --> 00:34:39.547
you're committed
to this road trip
with the tribute board?

314
00:34:39.681 --> 00:34:42.249
- Leaving tomorrow. right?
- Right.

315
00:34:42.382 --> 00:34:44.052
You finish that board in time.

316
00:34:44.184 --> 00:34:45.720
- I guarantee Margo
will be on a plane.

317
00:34:45.853 --> 00:34:49.289
Sean will be out by then.
Mistaken identity.

318
00:34:50.959 --> 00:34:52.192
Catching up with him
tomorrow.

319
00:34:52.326 --> 00:34:54.562
- We'll leave you to it.
- All right.

320
00:34:56.531 --> 00:34:59.634
- He'll come 'round.
Catch you later.
- See you.

321
00:35:11.713 --> 00:35:14.147
- So you're not saying no
to the trip?
- Clay.

322
00:35:14.281 --> 00:35:16.517
Okay. Okay.

323
00:35:32.432 --> 00:35:34.736
- Hey. beautiful.
- Hey.

324
00:35:39.373 --> 00:35:40.642
What's up. love?

325
00:35:40.775 --> 00:35:43.077
So there's nothing
to it. right?

326
00:35:43.210 --> 00:35:46.114
- What?
- With the police?

327
00:35:46.246 --> 00:35:47.782
Oh. no.

328
00:35:47.915 --> 00:35:50.652
Kane confirmed I was
at his place all night.

329
00:35:50.785 --> 00:35:53.353
It's just mistaken identity.
that's all.

330
00:35:55.188 --> 00:35:56.323
What?

331
00:35:59.594 --> 00:36:03.064
Someone broke into your place
after you left

332
00:36:03.196 --> 00:36:04.632
and I was really scared.

333
00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:08.335
- I was hiding.
- Did you see them?

334
00:36:08.468 --> 00:36:09.570
Mm. not really.

335
00:36:09.837 --> 00:36:11.271
Well. do you know
who they were?

336
00:36:11.405 --> 00:36:12.807
- No.
- Did they take anything?

337
00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:14.676
How would I know?

338
00:36:17.145 --> 00:36:19.279
Fuck!

339
00:36:19.413 --> 00:36:21.649
I can't do this.

340
00:36:23.283 --> 00:36:24.819
What?

341
00:36:24.952 --> 00:36:28.255
This. us.

342
00:36:28.388 --> 00:36:30.558
You're lying to me.

343
00:36:30.692 --> 00:36:33.928
I need you to be honest with me.
I really do.

344
00:36:38.833 --> 00:36:39.801
Katie!

345
00:36:44.906 --> 00:36:46.339
Fuck!

346
00:37:08.196 --> 00:37:09.597
What kept you?

347
00:37:09.731 --> 00:37:13.467
I'm here. aren't I?
How long you been out?

348
00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:17.437
I'm looking for someone.

349
00:37:20.208 --> 00:37:22.777
- You know them?
- Should I?

350
00:37:24.045 --> 00:37:25.913
Have a closer look.

351
00:37:27.014 --> 00:37:29.550
Don't know them offhand.

352
00:37:29.684 --> 00:37:31.384
Is this about surfies
dealing drugs?

353
00:37:31.519 --> 00:37:35.355
Could be.
Keep your ears open.

354
00:37:36.289 --> 00:37:37.658
I can check it out.

355
00:37:37.792 --> 00:37:40.360
Find out what's going down.
if you want.

356
00:37:40.494 --> 00:37:43.263
Yeah. I want.

357
00:37:44.397 --> 00:37:45.867
Okay.

358
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:51.572
When I've got
the information.
where you gonna be?

359
00:37:53.241 --> 00:37:55.475
Don't worry.
I'll find you.

360
00:38:10.423 --> 00:38:12.026
Go on. Kane.

361
00:38:37.417 --> 00:38:40.855
Kane.

362
00:38:40.988 --> 00:38:42.623
Hey. Kane.

363
00:38:48.563 --> 00:38:50.865
Hey.

364
00:39:01.776 --> 00:39:03.811
- Sean.
- What happened?

365
00:39:03.945 --> 00:39:07.048
- Massive wipe out.
- His head hit the reef.

366
00:39:07.181 --> 00:39:10.184
His dad's
not taking it well.
He just left.

367
00:39:10.318 --> 00:39:12.553
- Can I see him?
- Yeah. In here.

368
00:39:15.723 --> 00:39:17.925
He lost a lot of blood.

369
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:24.364
I should have been
there for him.
He could have died.

370
00:39:24.497 --> 00:39:27.034
He mumbled something
about you.

371
00:39:28.803 --> 00:39:31.339
He mentioned my name.
Are you sure?

372
00:39:31.471 --> 00:39:33.406
He said he was sorry.

373
00:39:34.575 --> 00:39:37.879
Sorry? About what?

374
00:39:38.012 --> 00:39:39.947
Letting you down.

375
00:39:42.817 --> 00:39:44.986
How? I don't get it.

376
00:39:45.119 --> 00:39:47.889
Maybe he was bummed
he couldn't come
on the trip with us.

377
00:39:50.191 --> 00:39:51.626
Yeah.

378
00:40:00.534 --> 00:40:02.904
I love you. mate.

379
00:40:04.005 --> 00:40:07.440
That board you built for my Dad.
it's gonna be safe with us.

380
00:40:10.578 --> 00:40:12.445
Hang in there.

381
00:40:33.701 --> 00:40:35.136
Pretty busy here. mate.

382
00:40:35.269 --> 00:40:36.771
Who the fuck are you?

383
00:40:37.672 --> 00:40:38.706
What do you want?

384
00:40:38.839 --> 00:40:40.741
Tell me who this is.

385
00:40:44.011 --> 00:40:45.179
No fucking idea.

386
00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:48.649
I'd try a little bit harder
if I were you. buddy.

387
00:41:01.028 --> 00:41:02.530
Have you got
an answer? Huh?

388
00:41:02.663 --> 00:41:04.464
Fuck you!

389
00:41:10.004 --> 00:41:10.938
Last chance.

390
00:41:11.072 --> 00:41:12.540
Fuck you.

391
00:42:01.088 --> 00:42:04.959
Hey. Lauren.
Um. there's something I--

392
00:42:05.092 --> 00:42:06.727
Look. I have
to apologize.

393
00:42:07.762 --> 00:42:09.063
You do? To who?

394
00:42:09.196 --> 00:42:10.431
You.

395
00:42:11.298 --> 00:42:14.769
- Why?
- I was wrong about Sean.

396
00:42:14.902 --> 00:42:18.272
I didn't get why you wanted
to date a bad boy like that.

397
00:42:18.406 --> 00:42:20.107
He was so polite and nice.

398
00:42:20.241 --> 00:42:22.543
and I know
I did just save his ass.

399
00:42:22.676 --> 00:42:25.246
but it was
something different.

400
00:42:25.379 --> 00:42:26.380
He was thankful.

401
00:42:26.515 --> 00:42:28.582
I see why you like him.

402
00:42:28.716 --> 00:42:30.684
and everyone has
two sides. right?

403
00:42:31.685 --> 00:42:32.920
And left.

404
00:42:34.221 --> 00:42:37.391
I'm apologizing to you
and you're making fun.

405
00:42:37.526 --> 00:42:40.294
No. I'm not.
I promise I'm not.

406
00:42:41.429 --> 00:42:43.631
So what did you
want to tell me?

407
00:42:45.499 --> 00:42:47.134
Nothing.

408
00:42:47.268 --> 00:42:50.871
Yeah. it doesn't--
it doesn't really matter.

409
00:43:07.721 --> 00:43:09.657
I'm so glad
you changed your mind.

410
00:43:12.793 --> 00:43:15.863
Sometimes we do
what we need to.

411
00:43:25.574 --> 00:43:26.541
Hello?

412
00:43:26.674 --> 00:43:28.309
<i>Sean. you there?</i>

413
00:43:28.442 --> 00:43:30.611
Rick. you prick! I told you
never to call me again.

414
00:43:30.744 --> 00:43:32.780
Mate. Look. things
are getting outta hand.

415
00:43:32.913 --> 00:43:35.082
Katie said someone broke in.
Is this related?

416
00:43:35.216 --> 00:43:36.717
Maybe.

417
00:43:36.884 --> 00:43:39.253
<i>- Mate. we need to get away.</i>
- We? What we?

418
00:43:39.386 --> 00:43:41.455
I told you.
I fucking warned you.

419
00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:44.291
Now if anything happens
to Katie. you are gone.
Do you understand?

420
00:43:44.425 --> 00:43:47.061
Mate. if they come for me.
I'm giving them you.

421
00:43:47.228 --> 00:43:50.464
<i>- Got that?</i>
- Piss off.

422
00:43:56.937 --> 00:43:59.039
Want a ride?

423
00:44:00.542 --> 00:44:02.042
Come on. Sean.
get in.

424
00:44:02.409 --> 00:44:04.411
- You guys have my board?
- On top. Come on.
let's go.

425
00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:29.069
- Tone. do you have a minute?
- Sure. What's up?

426
00:44:29.203 --> 00:44:31.839
Um. I wouldn't usually ask
at such late notice.

427
00:44:31.972 --> 00:44:33.874
but if I could take
a few days off.

428
00:44:34.008 --> 00:44:36.911
I would really
appreciate it.

429
00:44:37.044 --> 00:44:39.046
You know. we've got a couple
of big parties this week.

430
00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:43.417
Yeah. Um. yeah.
it's personal.

431
00:44:44.553 --> 00:44:47.021
Okay. I'll get someone
to cover for you.

432
00:44:47.154 --> 00:44:49.924
Thank you.
Okay. cool.

433
00:45:30.665 --> 00:45:32.534
So wedding's off. huh?

434
00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:36.370
Probably.
I messed things up
with her again.

435
00:45:36.504 --> 00:45:39.240
She'll hang in there.
Sean. dead set.

436
00:45:39.373 --> 00:45:40.474
She loves you.

437
00:45:52.453 --> 00:45:55.322
- We're good?
- Yeah. Happy days.

438
00:46:37.931 --> 00:46:39.333
All right.
Get in this.

439
00:46:40.134 --> 00:46:41.670
Woo.

440
00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:44.606
Yeah. that was
a good one.

441
00:46:44.739 --> 00:46:47.975
- Hey. Sean.
are you joining us?
- Yeah.

442
00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:51.478
Hey. guess what.
boys?

443
00:46:53.715 --> 00:46:55.015
My shout.

444
00:46:58.919 --> 00:47:00.287
What's the plan.
Stan?

445
00:47:00.421 --> 00:47:02.456
Just keeping
the vibe alive.

446
00:47:02.590 --> 00:47:04.358
I mean. Sean.

447
00:47:04.491 --> 00:47:06.827
I'm sure you'll make it
a weekend we won't forget.

448
00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:08.697
You having a go at me?

449
00:47:08.829 --> 00:47:11.265
- Because maybe I will make it
a weekend you won't forget.
- Yeah?

450
00:47:11.398 --> 00:47:13.467
Hey. hey. hey. hey!
It's cool. champ.

451
00:47:13.601 --> 00:47:14.835
Hey. um.
while you're up.

452
00:47:14.968 --> 00:47:16.771
why don't you
check out the van?

453
00:47:16.904 --> 00:47:18.573
I think there's something
in the back there
you might dig.

454
00:47:23.277 --> 00:47:24.612
- Come on. man.
- That was him.

455
00:47:24.746 --> 00:47:26.046
Just lay off.
will you?

456
00:47:34.288 --> 00:47:37.925
Wow. This is a replica
of Dad's board.

457
00:47:41.328 --> 00:47:42.963
All right. guys.
I. um...

458
00:47:43.732 --> 00:47:45.432
Yeah. I forgot about this.

459
00:47:45.567 --> 00:47:48.536
and I don't really know
what to say.

460
00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:51.573
Thanks to Kane

461
00:47:51.706 --> 00:47:54.408
and thank you. you guys.

462
00:47:54.542 --> 00:47:55.909
This. um...

463
00:47:57.244 --> 00:47:58.646
Yeah. it really means
a lot to me.

464
00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:00.914
Hey. man.
it's all good.

465
00:48:01.048 --> 00:48:03.083
Now grab yourself a beer.

466
00:48:03.217 --> 00:48:06.286
- You too. Jack.
- Thanks. guys.

467
00:48:11.626 --> 00:48:13.060
Happy days.

468
00:48:25.673 --> 00:48:28.475
- Any news?
- Yeah. I'm making progress.

469
00:48:30.277 --> 00:48:32.045
Uh. they wanted you
to sign these papers

470
00:48:32.179 --> 00:48:34.214
for the insurance
on the Mustang.

471
00:48:34.348 --> 00:48:38.686
That is not news.
Where are my drugs?

472
00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:42.891
I told you. boss.
I've got a good solid lead
on some surfie bozos.

473
00:48:43.056 --> 00:48:45.125
More bullshit!

474
00:48:45.259 --> 00:48:47.562
You're stalling me. Frank.
I know you.

475
00:48:47.695 --> 00:48:50.565
Hey. careful. boss.
I am trying my best here.

476
00:48:50.698 --> 00:48:52.266
Did you say careful?

477
00:48:52.399 --> 00:48:54.234
You come to me
with a little bit
of fucking lead

478
00:48:54.368 --> 00:48:57.137
about some fucking surfies
and that's it?

479
00:48:57.271 --> 00:48:59.139
Oh. you're getting old.
Frank.

480
00:48:59.273 --> 00:49:01.475
and you are way past
your use by date.

481
00:49:01.609 --> 00:49:06.113
I think it's you
that's past your use by date.

482
00:53:11.159 --> 00:53:12.727
You found me.

483
00:53:16.631 --> 00:53:19.701
- You got something for me?
- Yeah.

484
00:53:22.837 --> 00:53:23.871
Well?

485
00:53:24.639 --> 00:53:28.042
Cost of living's going up
all the time. Frank.

486
00:53:28.176 --> 00:53:30.545
So is the cost of dying.

487
00:53:32.013 --> 00:53:33.548
You know what? Fuck it.

488
00:53:33.681 --> 00:53:35.516
Why don't you talk
to that scumbag.
Rick Molet?

489
00:53:35.650 --> 00:53:37.685
He owes everybody.
including me.

490
00:53:40.353 --> 00:53:41.789
Well. now we're talking.

491
00:53:42.824 --> 00:53:46.426
So where do I find
this. uh. scumbag Molet?

492
00:53:48.361 --> 00:53:51.498
As I said. cost
of living's goin'--

493
00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:55.302
- Frank.
- Where is he?

494
00:53:55.435 --> 00:53:57.839
He lives
up Austinville somewhere.

495
00:54:09.884 --> 00:54:11.018
Frank!

496
00:54:12.954 --> 00:54:14.522
Frank!

497
00:54:16.224 --> 00:54:18.893
Frank! Frank!

498
00:54:43.483 --> 00:54:46.053
<i>And in other news.</i>
<i>police have discovered</i>

499
00:54:46.187 --> 00:54:50.490

Stop the car.

504
00:55:01.334 --> 00:55:03.004
Stop the car now!

505
00:55:18.451 --> 00:55:20.988
It's my fault.

506
00:55:21.122 --> 00:55:22.623
Couldn't help him. Sean.

507
00:55:22.757 --> 00:55:24.158
You had
nothing to do with it.

508
00:55:26.459 --> 00:55:28.696
He was my best pal.

509
00:55:38.639 --> 00:55:41.108
- We should go home.
- You're wrong. mate.

510
00:55:41.242 --> 00:55:43.945
If we go back now.
we'll fuck things up
completely for Sean.

511
00:55:44.078 --> 00:55:47.114
Who knows what he'll do?
It's for our Dads.
remember?

512
00:55:51.418 --> 00:55:53.821
- Okay.
- Come on.

513
00:56:35.997 --> 00:56:38.299
Memories. eh?
Remember that gig?

514
00:56:39.267 --> 00:56:41.202
The one where you met
your first girlfriend?

515
00:56:41.335 --> 00:56:44.372
Yeah. Until she ran off
with that guitarist
from Acca Dacca.

516
00:56:44.505 --> 00:56:45.806
Acca Dacca.

517
00:56:45.940 --> 00:56:47.241
This dude lost his girl
to a pensioner.

518
00:56:47.375 --> 00:56:48.910
Okay.

519
00:56:49.043 --> 00:56:50.711
What did he do.
take her back
to his nursing home?

520
00:56:50.845 --> 00:56:53.214
All right.
enough. Jesus.

521
00:57:38.893 --> 00:57:40.194
You coming out. mate?

522
00:57:47.268 --> 00:57:48.970
You okay?

523
00:57:49.103 --> 00:57:50.705
Yeah.

524
00:57:50.838 --> 00:57:52.540
I'm just gonna go
catch up with a mate.

525
00:57:52.673 --> 00:57:54.909
So I'll see you boys later.

526
00:57:56.344 --> 00:57:57.645
Let's do this.

527
00:58:20.568 --> 00:58:23.738
You know. I reckon Sean's
still on the gear.

528
00:58:23.871 --> 00:58:25.840
No way.
He's off that stuff.

529
00:58:25.973 --> 00:58:28.909
What about that shit
with Pete?
What did he mean?

530
00:58:29.043 --> 00:58:30.478
"It's my fault"?

531
00:58:30.611 --> 00:58:33.781
- He's hiding something.
- We're all hiding
something.

532
00:58:37.952 --> 00:58:40.521
Oh. good.
You got my message.

533
00:58:40.654 --> 00:58:42.556
- Pete's dead.
- I know.

534
00:58:42.690 --> 00:58:43.991
What. that's it?

535
00:58:44.792 --> 00:58:46.827
Pete was like a father
to me. Rick.

536
00:58:46.961 --> 00:58:48.796
Because of you.
he's gone.

537
00:58:48.929 --> 00:58:50.765
Shit happens. okay?
I did try and warn you. mate.

538
00:58:50.898 --> 00:58:52.767
No. no. You didn't warn me
about anything.

539
00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:54.402
but I don't give
a fuck anymore.

540
00:58:54.535 --> 00:58:56.804
You conned me into this.
I own that.

541
00:58:56.937 --> 00:58:58.672
What happened. happened.

542
00:58:58.806 --> 00:59:01.709
The only reason I am here
is to say return it

543
00:59:01.842 --> 00:59:03.210
before it's too late.

544
00:59:04.678 --> 00:59:06.847
Sean... Sean!

545
00:59:06.981 --> 00:59:08.749
I already did that.

546
00:59:10.084 --> 00:59:12.586
That's why I messaged you.
I don't have
the stash anymore.

547
00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:15.689
Stop lying! They broke
into my apartment!

548
00:59:15.823 --> 00:59:17.625
They killed Pete.
They want their drugs

549
00:59:17.758 --> 00:59:19.026
and they're coming
for you.

550
00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:20.628
And you!

551
00:59:23.497 --> 00:59:24.732
Look...

552
00:59:25.733 --> 00:59:28.803
I can help you
if you return it.

553
00:59:28.936 --> 00:59:31.872
That's it. No more.

554
00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:34.241
Just go.

555
00:59:35.309 --> 00:59:36.744
Go!

556
00:59:37.978 --> 00:59:39.346
You're a dead man.

557
01:00:05.005 --> 01:00:05.973
Hey.

558
01:00:07.908 --> 01:00:09.544
Nice waves out there.

559
01:00:09.677 --> 01:00:11.445
It's like this
most mornings.

560
01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:13.814
Glassy. south-easterly.

561
01:00:14.949 --> 01:00:16.450
Haven't seen you
around here before.

562
01:00:16.585 --> 01:00:18.219
Oh. camping.

563
01:00:19.887 --> 01:00:21.689
Nice shooter.

564
01:00:22.990 --> 01:00:24.658
I'm Jack. by the way.

565
01:00:24.792 --> 01:00:26.894
I'm Michelle.
My folks run the op shop.

566
01:00:27.027 --> 01:00:29.063
Cool. Yeah. yeah
I know the place.
I think.

567
01:00:29.196 --> 01:00:30.664
Um. near
the surf store. right?

568
01:00:30.798 --> 01:00:32.266
- Yeah. That's it.
- Yeah.

569
01:00:32.399 --> 01:00:34.368
So you up for it?

570
01:00:34.502 --> 01:00:35.836
You bet.

571
01:00:35.970 --> 01:00:37.905
Okay. Mick Fanning.
Let's go.

572
01:02:50.672 --> 01:02:51.905
Hey. Michelle!

573
01:02:52.773 --> 01:02:54.174
Hey. um. look.

574
01:02:54.308 --> 01:02:57.945
I just wanted to say
that you were amazing.

575
01:02:58.078 --> 01:02:59.380
All the boys say that.

576
01:03:01.716 --> 01:03:05.819
- Um. maybe we could--
- Catch you same time tomorrow?

577
01:03:07.788 --> 01:03:09.290
Yeah.

578
01:03:52.132 --> 01:03:53.768
This must have been
what it was like

579
01:03:54.101 --> 01:03:58.138
- for the old boys
when they were up here.
- Yep. Surfer's dream.

580
01:03:58.272 --> 01:04:00.841
- Sean didn't come back yet?
- He is here now.

581
01:04:02.309 --> 01:04:03.277
Sean.

582
01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:08.315
- It's Katie. right?
- Yeah.

583
01:04:08.449 --> 01:04:10.884
Yeah. I let
everyone down.
especially Katie.

584
01:04:11.018 --> 01:04:13.354
No. that's not right.
You've always been
straight with me.

585
01:04:13.487 --> 01:04:17.157
and whatever's happening
with Katie. you'll work it out.
You love her and she loves you.

586
01:04:17.291 --> 01:04:18.693
- You think?
- I know.

587
01:04:18.827 --> 01:04:20.628
Well. you're wrong. mate.

588
01:04:20.762 --> 01:04:22.329
See you boys
in the morning.

589
01:04:53.026 --> 01:04:54.261
Ahem.

590
01:04:58.031 --> 01:05:00.501
- I didn't think you'd show.
- And miss this?

591
01:05:02.035 --> 01:05:03.404
Big night?

592
01:05:03.538 --> 01:05:04.972
Ah. few beers.

593
01:05:05.105 --> 01:05:07.074
Do I really look
that shabby?

594
01:05:07.207 --> 01:05:09.109
Stop fishing
for compliments.

595
01:05:10.344 --> 01:05:13.447
- So are we gonna do this?
- You bet.

596
01:06:57.619 --> 01:07:00.855
Hey. would you like
to catch up for a drink?

597
01:07:00.989 --> 01:07:03.691
I've got work.
Sorry.

598
01:07:06.159 --> 01:07:07.562
Maybe after work?

599
01:07:08.796 --> 01:07:10.230
You're on.

600
01:07:14.334 --> 01:07:16.971
Okay. Pick me up
at the op shop.

601
01:07:17.104 --> 01:07:19.507
- Seven.
- Sure.

602
01:08:03.083 --> 01:08:04.451
Who is it?

603
01:08:07.021 --> 01:08:08.656
Is that you. Sean?

604
01:08:16.363 --> 01:08:17.832
Do I know you?

605
01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:21.636
Mate. what do you want?

606
01:08:21.769 --> 01:08:23.671
You have something
that belongs to me.

607
01:08:23.805 --> 01:08:25.105
Where is it?

608
01:08:25.238 --> 01:08:27.642
Why don't we talk this over?

609
01:08:27.775 --> 01:08:29.142
Whiskey?

610
01:08:54.669 --> 01:08:56.136
Mate. I don't have
your stuff.

611
01:08:56.269 --> 01:08:58.205
Lying is bad
for your health.

612
01:08:58.338 --> 01:09:01.042
I'm not lying. honest.

613
01:09:01.174 --> 01:09:03.745
The drugs.
Where are they?

614
01:09:11.451 --> 01:09:13.521
I'm asking you
a question.

615
01:09:15.723 --> 01:09:17.091
Sean.

616
01:09:17.224 --> 01:09:18.860
Sean's got your stuff.

617
01:09:18.993 --> 01:09:21.261
Sean's full name?

618
01:09:21.395 --> 01:09:23.463
Sean Bindaboo.

619
01:09:24.866 --> 01:09:26.166
This guy?

620
01:09:28.368 --> 01:09:29.837
Yes. mate.

621
01:09:42.416 --> 01:09:43.551
So where's Sean?

622
01:09:43.685 --> 01:09:45.218
Look. he's around town
somewhere.

623
01:09:45.352 --> 01:09:47.889
That's all I know.
Okay?

624
01:11:55.049 --> 01:11:56.316
Excuse me. ma'am.

625
01:11:56.449 --> 01:11:58.318
I'm. uh... just
a little bit lost here.

626
01:11:58.451 --> 01:12:01.689
and I was wondering
if you could show me
the way to. um--

627
01:12:03.124 --> 01:12:05.059
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

628
01:12:06.994 --> 01:12:08.763
Be still. calm down.
calm down.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

629
01:12:08.896 --> 01:12:10.264
I'm not gonna hurt you. okay?

630
01:12:10.397 --> 01:12:11.833
- You understand?
- Yeah.

631
01:12:11.966 --> 01:12:14.068
Now when I take my hand away.
if you scream.

632
01:12:14.202 --> 01:12:17.104
it's gonna be the last sound
you hear. okay?

633
01:12:17.238 --> 01:12:19.674
Okay. Now get in.

634
01:12:27.315 --> 01:12:28.816
I know you.

635
01:12:30.017 --> 01:12:32.553
It was you
at Sean's apartment.

636
01:12:33.855 --> 01:12:34.922
Maybe.

637
01:12:35.056 --> 01:12:38.159
You'd be dead now
if I'd seen you.

638
01:12:38.292 --> 01:12:40.460
What do you want with me?

639
01:12:40.595 --> 01:12:42.730
You? Nothing.

640
01:12:42.864 --> 01:12:44.799
Does your boyfriend
know you're here?

641
01:12:46.067 --> 01:12:47.535
It was meant to be
a surprise.

642
01:12:47.668 --> 01:12:51.005
Oh. it certainly will be.

643
01:12:51.138 --> 01:12:53.507
He took something
that belongs to me.

644
01:12:53.641 --> 01:12:56.344
Now he has a mobile. right?
You wanna call him?

645
01:12:56.476 --> 01:12:58.378
Let's call him.
come on.

646
01:12:58.512 --> 01:12:59.714
Call him.

647
01:13:18.132 --> 01:13:19.100
Katie?

648
01:13:19.233 --> 01:13:20.568
Sean.

649
01:13:20.735 --> 01:13:22.069
<i>Katie. I was</i>
<i>just texting you.</i>

650
01:13:22.203 --> 01:13:23.304
Look. I fucked up.

651
01:13:23.436 --> 01:13:25.806
Sean. I. um.
just listen.

652
01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:28.009
I'm sorry. It's just.
I'm struggling here.

653
01:13:28.142 --> 01:13:30.611
- I. um--
<i>- Seanie.</i>
<i>Seanie. Seanie.</i>

654
01:13:30.745 --> 01:13:32.813
that is so sweet.

655
01:13:36.117 --> 01:13:37.652
Who is this?

656
01:13:37.785 --> 01:13:40.420
It's your girlfriend's keeper.
She's right here next to me.

657
01:13:40.554 --> 01:13:41.822
- Katie?
<i>- Sean.</i>

658
01:13:41.956 --> 01:13:43.557
- Where are you?
<i>- What's going on?</i>

659
01:13:43.724 --> 01:13:44.892
<i>What have you done?</i>

660
01:13:45.026 --> 01:13:48.362
Are you satisfied.
asshole? Hm?

661
01:13:48.495 --> 01:13:51.098
I presume you do want
your girl back.

662
01:13:51.232 --> 01:13:53.334
Please just--
just don't touch her.

663
01:13:53.466 --> 01:13:56.904
Listen. this is what I want.
I want that package

664
01:13:57.038 --> 01:13:58.673
<i>that your friend</i>
<i>Rick Molet gave you.</i>

665
01:13:58.806 --> 01:14:00.440
I don't have the drugs!

666
01:14:00.608 --> 01:14:04.845
- Sean. I don't want
to hurt her.
<i>- Hey. hey.</i>

667
01:14:04.979 --> 01:14:07.515
Look. please. please don't.

668
01:14:07.648 --> 01:14:08.816
Please don't hurt her.

669
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:10.685
She's gonna be
in a box next to you

670
01:14:10.818 --> 01:14:12.753
if you don't tell me
where the drugs are.

671
01:14:12.887 --> 01:14:15.289
Rick stashed them. Okay?

672
01:14:15.455 --> 01:14:18.559
<i>I'm gonna need time</i>
<i>because they're a long way</i>
<i>from here.</i>

673
01:14:18.693 --> 01:14:20.061
How long?

674
01:14:20.261 --> 01:14:23.030
Let's say seven tonight.
The wharf at Blue Bay.

675
01:14:24.598 --> 01:14:25.666
Seanie.
I have your girl.

676
01:14:25.833 --> 01:14:28.035
<i>Don't be late.</i>

677
01:14:44.318 --> 01:14:45.753
Hey!

678
01:14:48.356 --> 01:14:49.724
They've got Katie!

679
01:14:50.624 --> 01:14:53.127
- Who's they?
- They. the bastards
that killed Pete.

680
01:14:53.260 --> 01:14:54.695
- You know
who killed Pete?
- Yeah.

681
01:14:54.829 --> 01:14:56.697
Look. I haven't been
honest with you.

682
01:14:57.999 --> 01:15:00.468
Look. Rick and Pete.
they got me to assist
in a drug boost.

683
01:15:00.601 --> 01:15:03.771
I-- I thought you were done
with that now that you're
with Katie.

684
01:15:03.904 --> 01:15:05.806
I was with Katie.
but she tossed me out.

685
01:15:07.108 --> 01:15:08.075
Fuck!

686
01:15:09.643 --> 01:15:12.246
I'm a fuckwit.
I'm a complete fuckwit.

687
01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:15.349
I agreed to do one last job.
it was just to repay debts...

688
01:15:15.483 --> 01:15:16.851
and now they've got Katie.

689
01:15:17.752 --> 01:15:19.687
They think
that I've got the coke.

690
01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:22.590
To buy me time.
I told them that I had it.

691
01:15:25.359 --> 01:15:26.794
You've really
messed up. man.

692
01:15:27.895 --> 01:15:29.764
What can I do to help?

693
01:15:30.698 --> 01:15:32.166
What. you'd do that?

694
01:15:32.299 --> 01:15:34.702
You'd help me
after everything I've done?

695
01:15:34.835 --> 01:15:38.005
Sure. We all
make mistakes. Jack?

696
01:15:39.173 --> 01:15:40.841
I'm not buying it.

697
01:15:40.975 --> 01:15:42.843
Mate. you've gotta get
your shit together.

698
01:15:42.977 --> 01:15:44.745
Yeah. I know. mate.

699
01:15:46.247 --> 01:15:49.116
After everything I've done.
I don't deserve your support.

700
01:15:49.250 --> 01:15:51.252
but I sure as hell
appreciate it.

701
01:15:51.385 --> 01:15:52.686
So what's the plan?

702
01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:54.889
What. sell the stash
and split it three ways?

703
01:15:56.525 --> 01:15:57.658
I'm just kidding!

704
01:15:57.792 --> 01:15:59.193
Can't believe
you fell for that.

705
01:15:59.326 --> 01:16:01.829
You take dumb one
to a whole new level.

706
01:16:01.962 --> 01:16:03.564
Of course I'm gonna help.
we're mates.

707
01:16:03.697 --> 01:16:06.734
Like Clay said.
we all fuck up.

708
01:16:06.867 --> 01:16:09.036
You know what?
At least you've owned it.

709
01:16:09.170 --> 01:16:11.540
I'm sorry. man. I shouldn't
have turned my back on you.

710
01:16:11.672 --> 01:16:13.808
Thank you.

711
01:16:15.810 --> 01:16:17.311
I really don't deserve
you guys.

712
01:16:17.445 --> 01:16:20.748
- It's Katie you don't deserve.
- Well. that's true.

713
01:16:20.881 --> 01:16:24.118
Now we've got to save her.
So how are we gonna do this?

714
01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:30.157
We're gonna need a few things
and a Navy travel bag.

715
01:16:31.926 --> 01:16:34.061
I know just the place.

716
01:16:37.532 --> 01:16:39.133
Give me five.

717
01:16:54.949 --> 01:16:58.619
- Well. hi.
You're here early.
- What?

718
01:16:58.752 --> 01:17:00.221
Oh!

719
01:17:00.354 --> 01:17:02.723
You haven't come
to cancel on me. have you?

720
01:17:02.857 --> 01:17:05.493
No. no. no. no. I. um...

721
01:17:05.626 --> 01:17:07.228
Wait. what's up?

722
01:17:16.837 --> 01:17:18.072
Michelle?

723
01:17:19.773 --> 01:17:21.976
You sure you still
want in on this?

724
01:17:22.109 --> 01:17:23.744
It could be dangerous.

725
01:17:24.613 --> 01:17:26.080
I'll be okay.

726
01:17:27.414 --> 01:17:30.050
So why did we choose
the Blue Bay spot
for the exchange?

727
01:17:30.184 --> 01:17:31.952
I remember the old wharf
from years ago.

728
01:17:32.086 --> 01:17:33.721
It's usually deserted.

729
01:17:44.098 --> 01:17:45.766
So what's the plan.
Stan?

730
01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:47.701
The deal is I go in.
I hand over the bag

731
01:17:47.835 --> 01:17:49.403
and I get Katie
out of there.

732
01:17:49.538 --> 01:17:51.506
And you trust them?

733
01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:54.742
No. You lot feel
like a paddle?

734
01:18:16.497 --> 01:18:17.798
Come.

735
01:18:21.536 --> 01:18:23.404
Your boyfriend's late.

736
01:18:59.541 --> 01:19:00.908
How are we gonna do this?

737
01:19:01.041 --> 01:19:03.210
Keep coming.

738
01:19:05.614 --> 01:19:07.047
Turn the torch off.

739
01:19:09.618 --> 01:19:10.918
We okay to exchange?

740
01:19:11.051 --> 01:19:13.622
Easy. Easy.

741
01:19:13.754 --> 01:19:17.091
Let's take it easy.
Come down here.

742
01:19:18.593 --> 01:19:20.094
Just take it easy.

743
01:19:21.663 --> 01:19:23.130
Move back.

744
01:19:25.799 --> 01:19:27.167
Drop the torch.

745
01:19:34.108 --> 01:19:35.809
Open the bag.

746
01:19:41.583 --> 01:19:42.584
Drop it.

747
01:19:42.717 --> 01:19:44.218
Hand her over first.

748
01:19:44.351 --> 01:19:46.086
Drop the bag.

749
01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:51.191
Move back.

750
01:19:51.325 --> 01:19:53.027
Back it up.

751
01:20:11.045 --> 01:20:13.814
- Hey. look.
- They've started without us.

752
01:20:20.588 --> 01:20:21.556
No!

753
01:20:28.996 --> 01:20:30.831
I'm gonna go help Katie.

754
01:20:55.856 --> 01:20:58.258
Hey. are you okay?

755
01:20:59.493 --> 01:21:00.928
Shit.

756
01:21:09.136 --> 01:21:11.472
- Help.
- Sean!

757
01:21:11.606 --> 01:21:13.340
There's Sean!

758
01:21:15.042 --> 01:21:16.511
- Sean.
- Sean!

759
01:21:16.644 --> 01:21:18.879
- Come on.
get on the board.
- Sean.

760
01:21:20.815 --> 01:21:22.282
Oh. God.

761
01:21:22.416 --> 01:21:26.721
- Hey. hey.
- You're okay.
You're okay.

762
01:21:26.855 --> 01:21:29.490
I am sorry. so sorry.

763
01:21:29.624 --> 01:21:30.924
- Yeah.
- Are you okay?

764
01:21:31.058 --> 01:21:32.727
I am okay. yeah.

765
01:21:39.933 --> 01:21:41.235
It's okay

766
01:22:14.869 --> 01:22:19.339
<i>G'day. sweetheart.</i>
<i>My name's. uh. Boo.</i>

767
01:23:25.405 --> 01:23:26.173
Dad!

768
01:23:26.306 --> 01:23:27.474
Ho. ho. ho.

769
01:23:27.609 --> 01:23:29.544
Hey. Dad.

770
01:23:33.447 --> 01:23:35.950
No way you're starting
without me.

771
01:23:36.083 --> 01:23:39.319
Hey. Kane.
you made it.

772
01:23:52.165 --> 01:23:54.969
This tribute is for my Dad.

773
01:23:55.102 --> 01:23:57.337
affectionately known as Boo.

774
01:23:58.472 --> 01:24:01.341
Summer City was his turf.

775
01:24:01.475 --> 01:24:03.243
He knew
how to have a good time...

776
01:24:04.344 --> 01:24:06.280
how to ride a decent wave.

777
01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:08.816
Most importantly.

778
01:24:09.149 --> 01:24:12.654
he respected the love
that you Dads and friends
had for him.

779
01:24:14.556 --> 01:24:16.791
Like all of us.
he wasn't perfect.

780
01:24:19.827 --> 01:24:22.195
I'm still proud
to be called this son.
