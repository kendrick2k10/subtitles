873
00:47:26.408 --> 00:47:28.149
and he sort of bowed.

874
00:47:28.236 --> 00:47:30.760
It was quite a kind of almost
feudal thing. you know.

875
00:47:30.848 --> 00:47:33.720
He sort of bowed
slightly to him.

Sergei felt like

877
00:47:36.375 --> 00:47:38.899
his relationship with Putin
was special.

878
00:47:38.986 --> 00:47:41.249
and he was stunned
when the president demanded

879
00:47:41.336 --> 00:47:43.425
a cut of his business.

880
00:47:43.512 --> 00:47:45.036
- He owned a huge property
on Red Square.

881
00:47:45.123 --> 00:47:47.299
which was half the length
of Red Square.

882
00:47:47.386 --> 00:47:49.954
And he was meant to make it
into a very luxurious hotel.

883
00:47:50.041 --> 00:47:52.086
And it was worth--
I don't know--3 billion.

884
00:47:52.173 --> 00:47:54.132
He got some very famous
Belgian architects

885
00:47:54.219 --> 00:47:57.309
who came and made a whole plan
of how to develop it

886
00:47:57.396 --> 00:47:59.746
into a luxury hotel.

887
00:47:59.833 --> 00:48:02.357

it's opposite the Kremlin.

891
00:48:09.451 --> 00:48:11.671
so I have to see what
the plan is for this hotel.

892
00:48:11.758 --> 00:48:14.021
And so Putin came.
He showed him the plan.

893
00:48:14.108 --> 00:48:17.459
And he says that during the
meeting. Putin's face changed.

894
00:48:17.546 --> 00:48:18.504
and suddenly. he realized.
oh. my gosh.

895
00:48:18.591 --> 00:48:20.636
He's so jealous.

896
00:48:20.723 --> 00:48:22.682
Weeks later. these guards
were moved in.

897
00:48:22.769 --> 00:48:24.902
and the property was seized.

898
00:48:24.989 --> 00:48:26.555
And that was the
first time that

899
00:48:26.642 --> 00:48:28.296
he'd had to hand
something over.

900
00:48:28.383 --> 00:48:30.429
And he told Sergei.
you're gonna be compensated.

901
00:48:30.516 --> 00:48:33.040
and he never was compensated.

902
00:48:33.127 --> 00:48:36.130
Sergei told me. "Because
I don't give him money.

903
00:48:36.217 --> 00:48:37.958
I'm being punished."

904
00:48:38.045 --> 00:48:41.657
By this point. Putin had gone
power hungry and crazy. really.

905
00:48:41.744 --> 00:48:43.746
- There's no difference
between Russian organized crime

906
00:48:43.833 --> 00:48:45.487
and the Russian government.

907
00:48:45.574 --> 00:48:47.011
The Russian government
is effectively

908
00:48:47.098 --> 00:48:48.577
an organized crime
organization.

909
00:48:48.664 --> 00:48:51.493

916
00:49:10.077 --> 00:49:14.038
uncovered a $230 million
government corruption scheme.

917
00:49:14.125 --> 00:49:16.823
And he believed that there
was a rule of law in Russia.

918
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:18.259
And he believed that
even though there

919
00:49:18.346 --> 00:49:19.826
was corruption in the system
that the law

920
00:49:19.913 --> 00:49:21.567
would eventually prevail.

921
00:49:21.654 --> 00:49:27.181
And he thought that Putin was
a patriot and a nationalist.

922
00:49:27.268 --> 00:49:30.184
And I never believed
any of those things.

923
00:49:30.271 --> 00:49:33.231

But Sergei was a patriot

927
00:49:42.501 --> 00:49:44.546
and he stayed in Russia.

928
00:49:44.633 --> 00:49:46.635
And he was
subsequently arrested.

929
00:49:46.722 --> 00:49:47.767
tortured. and killed.

930
00:49:50.639 --> 00:49:52.424
That weighs very heavily
on me.

931
00:49:52.511 --> 00:49:54.992

941
00:50:21.888 --> 00:50:23.585
- Every day.
I would type in Sergei's name

you know. what he was doing

have diplomatic immunity.

I didn't care about the money.

1044

1045
00:55:31.763 --> 00:55:34.461

like a child in a sweet shop.

1046
00:55:34.548 --> 00:55:39.771
just amazed by the sort
of lavishness of it.

1047
00:55:39.858 --> 00:55:42.774

live in those villas.

1055
00:55:58.572 --> 00:56:00.879

was lie in bed

1056
00:56:00.966 --> 00:56:02.663
and watch the Weather Channel.

1057
00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:05.884
- Putin--because he came
from a very--

1058

- Humble.
- Very humble family.

1059
00:56:08.626 --> 00:56:12.934

in understanding who he is

his behavior. everything

just seems to mirror Putin.

1063
00:56:18.375 --> 00:56:22.901
And from my experience.
he trusts nobody.

1064
00:56:22.988 --> 00:56:27.558

there was a safe way of.

just bulldoze his way

through everything.

I just tell you one thing.

I am not following.

01:04:04.144 --> 01:04:06.451
humiliate him and sort of
laugh at him.

1216
01:04:06.538 --> 01:04:08.279
And she was from a more
sophisticated family.

1217
01:04:08.366 --> 01:04:10.803
He was from a very. very poor.
very humble family.

1218
01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:12.587
And I think she came from a.

1219
01:04:12.674 --> 01:04:14.241
you know.
more well-off family.

1220
01:04:14.328 --> 01:04:17.897
And so then the boot
was on the other foot.

1221
01:04:17.984 --> 01:04:21.814
So I think maybe there was
an element of revenge.

1222
01:04:21.901 --> 01:04:24.121
narrator: The presidential
divorce isn't a huge surprise

1223
01:04:24.208 --> 01:04:25.862
to the Russian public.

1224
01:04:25.949 --> 01:04:27.602
for whom it was
common knowledge

1225
01:04:27.689 --> 01:04:30.083
that Putin had a mistress.

1226
01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:33.826
Alexandra remembers
when she first saw her.

1227
01:04:33.913 --> 01:04:36.263
- It was a very big event.
All the oligarchs were there.

1228
01:04:36.350 --> 01:04:38.004
And then we were just
sort of standing around.

1229
01:04:38.091 --> 01:04:40.050
and I saw a little gathering.

1230
01:04:40.137 --> 01:04:41.790
and I looked over.

1231
01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:44.184
and there was a girl in a kind
of Grecian white dress--

1232
01:04:44.271 --> 01:04:46.665
yeah. that dress a bit like
Marilyn Monroe famously wore--

1233
01:04:46.752 --> 01:04:48.928
sort of twirling around.

1234
01:04:49.015 --> 01:04:51.365
And it was eye catching 'cause
it was quite extraordinary

1235
01:04:51.452 --> 01:04:53.063
that--obviously the attention
that she wanted

1236
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:56.283
and that she had this group
of people watching her.

1237
01:04:56.370 --> 01:04:57.371
And I turned to Sergei.
and it was just--

1238
01:04:57.458 --> 01:04:58.720
I said. oh. my gosh.

1239
01:04:58.807 --> 01:05:01.027
I taught that girl English.
It's Alina.

1240
01:05:01.114 --> 01:05:03.421
And I hadn't seen her since.

1241
01:05:03.508 --> 01:05:06.337
and it was just--seemed
such a funny coincidence.

1242
01:05:06.424 --> 01:05:08.121
But what struck me most
was that

1243
01:05:08.208 --> 01:05:09.644
she had put on so much weight.

1244
01:05:09.731 --> 01:05:11.124
and she's obviously
a very. very famous--

1245
01:05:11.211 --> 01:05:12.996
well. very famous
in Russia--sportswoman.

1246
01:05:13.083 --> 01:05:14.519
So I said to Sergei.
oh. my goodness.

1247
01:05:14.606 --> 01:05:16.521
But she's--
poor thing. she's so fat

1248
01:05:16.608 --> 01:05:17.870
compared to what she was.

1249
01:05:17.957 --> 01:05:21.395
And he said.
oh. well. she's pregnant.

1250
01:05:21.482 --> 01:05:24.007
And she is Putin's girlfriend.

1251
01:05:24.094 --> 01:05:25.530
narrator:
Even after his divorce.

1252
01:05:25.617 --> 01:05:27.836
Putin keeps his life
with Alina Kabaeva

1253
01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:29.838
out of the public eye.

1254
01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:31.405
- The weird thing is.
you think.

1255
01:05:31.492 --> 01:05:33.320
why don't you now live
with Alina Kabaeva officially?

1256
01:05:33.407 --> 01:05:34.669
She was a gymnast.

1257
01:05:34.756 --> 01:05:36.802
She's like
a real Soviet heroine.

1258
01:05:36.889 --> 01:05:38.673
which really fits with the
whole propaganda

1259
01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:40.980
Soviet angle now.

1260
01:05:41.067 --> 01:05:42.286
And that's quite a mystery.

1261
01:05:42.373 --> 01:05:43.896
but I can only guess
that he's just such

1262
01:05:43.983 --> 01:05:45.767
an egomaniac that he
doesn't literally want

1263
01:05:45.854 --> 01:05:47.856
anyone distracting from him.

1264
01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:49.858
I don't know.

1265
01:05:49.946 --> 01:05:52.252
narrator: To observers.
Putin appears

1266
01:05:52.339 --> 01:05:55.038
more isolated than ever.

1267
01:05:55.125 --> 01:05:59.085
- This is--you know. this is
a very lonely existence.

1268
01:05:59.172 --> 01:06:00.782
And. you know.
you should be surrounded

1269
01:06:00.869 --> 01:06:04.612
by your grandchildren
and love and family.

1270
01:06:04.699 --> 01:06:08.921
He completely alienated
everyone because he is--

1271
01:06:09.008 --> 01:06:10.749
you know. he was
always paranoid.

1272
01:06:10.836 --> 01:06:13.317
But now I think there are so--

1273
01:06:13.404 --> 01:06:17.103
there are millions of people
across the globe who wish him--

1274
01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:18.278
- Dead.
- Dead.

1275
01:06:21.499 --> 01:06:23.327
- I know this. his nickname

1276
01:06:23.414 --> 01:06:25.982
the other KGB officers
gave him--

1277
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:27.853
the moth.

1278
01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:29.986
That's important.

1279
01:06:30.073 --> 01:06:36.253
At night. in silent. in dark.
nicknames in Russia so strong.

1280
01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:38.168
It's like a bullet.

1281
01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:43.608
narrator: Until his war on
Ukraine.

1282
01:06:43.695 --> 01:06:45.958
most countries understood
Putin not just

1283
01:06:46.045 --> 01:06:49.440
as a ruthless dictator
but also as a leader

1284
01:06:49.527 --> 01:06:53.096
in control of vast
energy resources.

1285
01:06:53.183 --> 01:06:55.620
someone you had
to do business with.

1286
01:06:55.707 --> 01:06:59.058
Here he is in 2018
at an opening ceremony

1287
01:06:59.145 --> 01:07:02.409
for the World Cup
being hosted by Russia.

1288
01:07:02.496 --> 01:07:05.064
- This is the face of Russia.

1289
01:07:05.151 --> 01:07:08.589
This is the face
of the Russia that we love.

1290
01:07:08.676 --> 01:07:12.245
And thank you most importantly
as well. President Putin.

1291
01:07:12.332 --> 01:07:14.291
[speaks Russian]
For your commitment.

1292
01:07:14.378 --> 01:07:16.945
for your dedication.
for your passion.

1293
01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:19.731
Without you. all this
would not have been possible.

1294
01:07:19.818 --> 01:07:21.907
I'm sure about that.

1295
01:07:21.994 --> 01:07:24.214
So thank you. Congratulations.

1296
01:07:24.301 --> 01:07:27.521
We did a good job
together as well.

1297
01:07:27.608 --> 01:07:31.047
[applause]

1298
01:07:31.134 --> 01:07:32.396
- Putin has done
a very good job

1299
01:07:32.483 --> 01:07:34.659
over the last 22 years

1300
01:07:34.746 --> 01:07:38.228
of only committing crimes
that were plausibly deniable.

1301
01:07:38.315 --> 01:07:41.709
Creating this ambiguity.
he was able to feed

1302
01:07:41.796 --> 01:07:46.062
into the apologists and the
appeasers around the world

1303
01:07:46.149 --> 01:07:48.542
and give them enough
ammunition to say

1304
01:07:48.629 --> 01:07:49.891
we don't know for sure
whether--

1305
01:07:49.978 --> 01:07:52.285
who shot down MH17.

1306
01:07:52.372 --> 01:07:54.766
We don't know
for sure who killed

1307
01:07:54.853 --> 01:07:57.508
Alexander Litvinenko.
even though everybody

1308
01:07:57.595 --> 01:07:59.205
knew for sure.

1309
01:07:59.292 --> 01:08:03.601
But in doing so. it allowed
business to carry on.

1310
01:08:03.688 --> 01:08:06.343
narrator: And Bill Browder
has had a personal reminder

1311
01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:09.302
from Vladimir Putin himself
that the Russian ruler

1312
01:08:09.389 --> 01:08:11.783
never forgives or forgets.

1313
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:14.394
- In early July 2018.

1314
01:08:14.481 --> 01:08:16.917
Donald Trump
and Vladimir Putin met

1315
01:08:17.005 --> 01:08:20.183
in the first organized summit
in Helsinki.

1316
01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:23.663
And it was just after the
Robert Mueller investigation

1317
01:08:23.751 --> 01:08:27.625
had indicted
12 Russian GRU officers

1318
01:08:27.712 --> 01:08:29.582
for interfering
in the U.S. elections.

1319
01:08:29.670 --> 01:08:32.804
and at the press conference.
one of the journalists

1320
01:08:32.890 --> 01:08:34.675
raised his hand
and asked Putin--

1321
01:08:34.761 --> 01:08:36.328
- And will you consider
extraditing

1322
01:08:36.416 --> 01:08:38.636
the 12 Russian officials
that were indicted

1323
01:08:38.723 --> 01:08:40.725
last week by a U.S. grand jury?

1324
01:08:40.812 --> 01:08:43.684
- And Putin said yes.

1325
01:08:43.770 --> 01:08:45.295
- [speaking Russian]
- Then we would expect

1326
01:08:45.381 --> 01:08:49.821
that the Americans would
reciprocate Mr. Browder

1327
01:08:49.908 --> 01:08:52.519
in this particular case.

1328
01:08:52.606 --> 01:08:55.348
Business associates
of Mr. Browder

1329
01:08:55.435 --> 01:09:00.439
have earned over
$1.5 billion in Russia.

1330
01:09:00.527 --> 01:09:02.703
They never paid
any taxes neither in Russia

1331
01:09:02.790 --> 01:09:04.270
nor in the United States.

1332
01:09:04.357 --> 01:09:07.621
- And then the question
was asked

1333
01:09:07.707 --> 01:09:10.493
of Trump. what do you think?

1334
01:09:10.581 --> 01:09:11.886
- I think that's
an incredible offer. okay?

1335
01:09:11.973 --> 01:09:12.886
- Thank you.

1336
01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:18.109
- Now. it's one thing
for Putin to go after me.

1337
01:09:18.197 --> 01:09:19.676
He has been publicly naming me.

1338
01:09:19.764 --> 01:09:21.853
He's been chasing me
with death threats.

1339
01:09:21.939 --> 01:09:24.986
kidnapping threats.
arrest warrants.

1340
01:09:25.073 --> 01:09:27.250
And I'd grown used to that.

1341
01:09:27.337 --> 01:09:30.731
But to have the president
of the United States.

1342
01:09:30.818 --> 01:09:33.343
the most powerful man
in the free world.

1343
01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:35.345
ready to hand me over to Putin

1344
01:09:35.432 --> 01:09:40.567
to effectively be killed.
that was a shock.

1345
01:09:40.654 --> 01:09:42.874
narrator: German Gorbuntsov.
who survived

1346
01:09:42.961 --> 01:09:46.269
being gunned down. is another
victim of the regime

1347
01:09:46.356 --> 01:09:48.836
still looking
over his shoulder.

1348
01:09:48.923 --> 01:09:51.752
- [speaking Russian]

1349
01:10:03.155 --> 01:10:04.243
narrator:
But Evgeny Chichvarkin

1350
01:10:04.330 --> 01:10:06.593
is decidedly not afraid.

1351
01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:09.335
In fact. he has spoken out
in support

1352
01:10:09.422 --> 01:10:13.818
of Russia's jailed opposition
leader Alexei Navalny.

1353
01:10:16.821 --> 01:10:18.779
- What's happened
to him few times

1354
01:10:18.866 --> 01:10:20.868
is absolutely unacceptable.

1355
01:10:20.955 --> 01:10:25.873
It's a crime.

1356
01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:30.574
I think he have to be
on election list.

1357
01:10:30.661 --> 01:10:32.402
and Putin
have to be in the prison.

1358
01:10:34.578 --> 01:10:37.450
- Alexei Navalny is a friend.

1359
01:10:37.537 --> 01:10:39.713
And when he got poisoned.
you know.

1360
01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:41.149
everyone was in shock.

1361
01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:43.717
But. you know.
when someone you've--

1362
01:10:43.804 --> 01:10:45.980
I don't know--
went for dinner with

1363
01:10:46.067 --> 01:10:51.899
is there unconscious. in coma.
his wife absolutely distraught.

1364
01:10:51.986 --> 01:10:54.902
narrator: Tatiana knows the
couple's support for Navalny

1365
01:10:54.989 --> 01:10:58.341
comes at a steep
personal cost.

1366
01:10:58.428 --> 01:11:00.647
- I kept going back to Russia

1367
01:11:00.734 --> 01:11:03.346
up until autumn 2021.

1368
01:11:03.433 --> 01:11:04.869
People kept telling me.
you're crazy.

1369
01:11:04.956 --> 01:11:06.566
This is crazy.
Stop doing this.

1370
01:11:06.653 --> 01:11:08.960
And Evgeny was really worried.

1371
01:11:09.047 --> 01:11:11.049
And I used to take
our daughter with me

1372
01:11:11.136 --> 01:11:12.790
because for me. it was very
important for her

1373
01:11:12.877 --> 01:11:16.794
to see St. Petersburg
to know what our heritage is.

1374
01:11:16.881 --> 01:11:18.578
These are normal things.

1375
01:11:18.665 --> 01:11:21.973
I should be able
to do this with my daughter.

1376
01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:24.932
Going to Russia now
would be suicide for me

1377
01:11:25.019 --> 01:11:27.935
because I will--
the plane will land.

1378
01:11:28.022 --> 01:11:30.721
and then they will just show me
all the various things

1379
01:11:30.808 --> 01:11:32.462
I've said and say.

1380
01:11:32.549 --> 01:11:34.420
"According to the new law
of Russian Federation.

1381
01:11:34.507 --> 01:11:36.161
"blah. blah. blah. blah.
blah. blah. blah. blah. blah.

1382
01:11:36.248 --> 01:11:40.557
you are going
to prison for 20 years."

1383
01:11:42.472 --> 01:11:44.778
narrator: Another brave voice.
but this one still based

1384
