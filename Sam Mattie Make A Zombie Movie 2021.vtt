We all officially agreed that
rule number one was to have fun.

138
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.795

140

and they were determined

166
00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:14.763

Leslie is your little sister.

522
00:24:01.001 --> 00:24:04.167
- L-E-S-L-I-E.
- They're identical twins.

523
00:24:04.202 --> 00:24:06.136
But. identical twins
with the same name?

524
00:24:06.171 --> 00:24:10.976
Leslie Alexander Smith
and Leslie Rosa Smith.

525
00:24:11.011 --> 00:24:12.912
- Okay.
- Yeah. so one is...

526
00:24:12.947 --> 00:24:14.815
So. one is older
and one is younger.

527
00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:17.488
- But. they're still twins?
- Yeah.

528
00:24:17.523 --> 00:24:19.886
So. I'm. like.
the second little brother.

529
00:24:19.921 --> 00:24:22.592
but I'm older.

530
00:24:22.627 --> 00:24:24.495
Mattie's the oldest.

531
00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:26.596
- Yep.
- But...

532
00:24:26.631 --> 00:24:28.598
- Yeah.
- So then.

533
00:24:28.633 --> 00:24:30.963
I'm still not clear on...

534
00:24:30.998 --> 00:24:33.999
This is the dad
and this is the Devil.

535
00:24:34.034 --> 00:24:35.902
- Yep.
- This is the two Leslies

536
00:24:35.937 --> 00:24:37.178
and this is the two
of us right here.

537
00:24:37.202 --> 00:24:38.839
and me and Mattie
are in right here.

538
00:24:38.874 --> 00:24:41.776
- like in the belly.
- I just wanna reconcile. again.

539
00:24:41.811 --> 00:24:44.042
that they're in the room
when you guys are being born.

540
00:24:44.077 --> 00:24:45.285
- They do exist...
- But. that means they have to be

541
00:24:45.309 --> 00:24:46.913
- older than you.
- Yeah. we exist.

542
00:24:46.948 --> 00:24:48.288
- No. I'm not letting...
- If they're already in the room

543
00:24:48.312 --> 00:24:49.993
- when you're being born...
- I'm not letting

544
00:24:50.017 --> 00:24:52.017
my little sister
be older than me and Mattie.

545
00:24:52.052 --> 00:24:54.250
My movie. so they're young.

546
00:24:54.285 --> 00:24:56.725
All right. that's totally fine.
but then why are they

547
00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.188
in the room
when you're being born?

548
00:24:58.223 --> 00:25:00.729
I don't understand.
if they're younger.

549
00:25:00.764 --> 00:25:03.259
They're younger because
they were the first younger...

550
00:25:03.294 --> 00:25:05.932
Because they were
the first born...

551
00:25:05.967 --> 00:25:07.736
They're like
the first two babies born.

552
00:25:07.771 --> 00:25:09.144
I think we're getting
further and further away.

553
00:25:09.168 --> 00:25:11.773
There's two people
that are in the room

554
00:25:11.808 --> 00:25:13.555
that no one's ever
gonna be like. "Who's those?"

555
00:25:13.579 --> 00:25:14.820
It's just like.
there's two other characters

556
00:25:14.844 --> 00:25:16.547
that are in the room.
deal with it.

557
00:25:16.582 --> 00:25:18.758
Whoever's older. who's younger.
that doesn't really matter.

558
00:25:18.782 --> 00:25:20.848
Whose kids are where.
but the storyline is like.

559
00:25:20.883 --> 00:25:23.653
why does the Devil want...?

560
00:25:23.688 --> 00:25:24.984
Is even going through all this?

561
00:25:25.019 --> 00:25:27.184
Why is he turning everyone
into zombies?

562
00:25:27.219 --> 00:25:29.120
Why is... why is he
going after the Leslies?

563
00:25:29.155 --> 00:25:30.572
So. let's just establish
the Leslies...

564
00:25:30.596 --> 00:25:32.123
Because... because of the dad.

565
00:25:32.158 --> 00:25:34.862
said to him to grow up.

566
00:25:34.897 --> 00:25:36.600
Grow up.

567
00:25:36.635 --> 00:25:38.140
Oh. so he's just... it's revenge
for saying. "Grow up."

568
00:25:38.164 --> 00:25:39.834
He's pissed about
the "grow up" comment.

569
00:25:39.869 --> 00:25:41.583
So. exactly. I'm not gonna...
I'm not only gonna get

570
00:25:41.607 --> 00:25:42.903
your older-younger siblings...

571
00:25:44.709 --> 00:25:45.909
you know what I'm gonna do?

572
00:25:45.941 --> 00:25:47.842
I'm gonna go make
everybody zombies.

573
00:25:47.877 --> 00:25:50.218
make everybody demons. and we're
gonna go after their family.

574
00:25:50.242 --> 00:25:51.846
- Wait. I was...
- And zombie demons.

575
00:25:51.881 --> 00:25:55.047
And zombie demons.
something like that. right?

576
00:25:55.082 --> 00:25:56.851
He wants to kill
our girlfriends. too.

577
00:25:56.886 --> 00:25:58.193
And I just wanna
kill their girlfriends.

578
00:25:58.217 --> 00:25:59.953
'cause no one
tells me to grow up.

579
00:25:59.988 --> 00:26:01.724
- Exactly.
- Right. right?

580
00:26:01.759 --> 00:26:03.759
They'll have their moments.
but they get over it

581
00:26:03.794 --> 00:26:05.926
and they get back in there.
and they want it.

582
00:26:05.961 --> 00:26:07.928

You guys have been
working really hard on this.

600
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:49.398
To dream big. and to write big.
and that's what

601
00:26:49.433 --> 00:26:51.675
you're supposed to do
on the script-writing phase.

602
00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:53.270
so you guys nailed it.

603
00:26:53.305 --> 00:26:56.878
You guys have written a script
that is a movie

604
00:26:56.913 --> 00:27:00.211
that's much. much. much bigger
of a budget

605
00:27:00.246 --> 00:27:02.950
- than what we actually have.
- Oh. okay.

606
00:27:02.985 --> 00:27:04.248
- Yeah.
- Okay.

607
00:27:06.087 --> 00:27:07.801
So. that's something that

your script into locations.

610
00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:17.030

611

Brett Fav-re.

748
00:33:06.348 --> 00:33:08.546
That was just an ad lib.
you know. that kinda thing.

So. you're gonna
find things just going...

750

You know. just ad libbing.
you're gonna find funny stuff.

like. you guys. I mean.

you can identify
with these guys. right?

753
00:33:18.624 --> 00:33:20.723
Except you're not
actually brothers.

754
00:33:20.758 --> 00:33:23.099
but I love that you...
In this one...

755

Oh. there are two moms in this?

Yeah. that's... I love that.

759

because I've never seen that.

760
00:33:34.574 --> 00:33:36.739
- It's new. yeah.
- That's pretty original.

761
00:33:36.774 --> 00:33:39.280
This is what happens
when we write scripts.

762
00:33:39.315 --> 00:33:41.381
A lot of times the studio
comes to us and they say.

763
00:33:41.416 --> 00:33:44.219
"Please don't do this or do that
because it might offend people."

764
00:33:44.254 --> 00:33:47.255
and sometimes I'm like. "Well.
why would that be offensive?"

765
00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:50.159
And then. they point it out.
and I'm like. "True."

766
00:33:50.194 --> 00:33:52.689
There were a couple things
in here that I would avoid.

767
00:33:52.724 --> 00:33:56.132
like. you know. this is
a guy's fantasy movie. right?

768
00:33:56.167 --> 00:33:57.661
- Yeah.
- But. you must respect

769
00:33:57.696 --> 00:33:59.564
the women in it.
and make sure you do that.

770
00:33:59.599 --> 00:34:02.138
It's just. you know...
There's a point where it...

771
00:34:02.173 --> 00:34:03.601
You don't wanna lose the women.

772
00:34:03.636 --> 00:34:06.076
because that's
50 percent of your audience.

773
00:34:06.111 --> 00:34:07.572
You know.
you want them to love you.

774
00:34:07.607 --> 00:34:09.376
and you do love
these guys in here.

775
00:34:09.411 --> 00:34:12.544
but there's just a couple lines
where I wouldn't cross.

776
00:34:12.579 --> 00:34:14.227

Us with our other brother Jesse.

1201
00:55:52.878 --> 00:55:56.385
we moved out to New York
about 10 years ago.

1202
00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:59.520
and we started with a street
cart here in New York and...

1203
00:55:59.555 --> 00:56:01.621
- We saw the picture.
- Yeah. and then we went on

1204
00:56:01.656 --> 00:56:03.700
to open a few restaurants.
so that's where we are now.

1205
00:56:03.724 --> 00:56:06.725
- Just selling tacos.
- Oh. cool.

1206
00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:08.958
Have you heard of

I have heard of

1208
00:56:10.863 --> 00:56:13.666
- Can I have some?
- We've mentioned that

1209
00:56:13.701 --> 00:56:15.481
these guys reached out to me.
they said that.

1210
00:56:15.505 --> 00:56:16.438
you know.
they maybe wanted to do

1211
00:56:16.473 --> 00:56:18.572
some product placement
in the movie. but...

1212
00:56:18.607 --> 00:56:22.609
Yeah. we saw the Kickstarter
and we were instantly excited.

1213
00:56:22.644 --> 00:56:23.918
'cause it seemed like
an awesome movie.

1214
00:56:23.942 --> 00:56:26.613
- Yeah.
- So any chance we can be a part

1215
00:56:26.648 --> 00:56:28.714

we wanna do whatever we can.

1216
00:56:28.749 --> 00:56:30.584

1217

put it through his rectum
and blow it up.

1228
00:57:00.143 --> 00:57:02.979
- Yeah.
- You know. my concern would be

1229
00:57:03.014 --> 00:57:06.719
potentially using rectums
with our food.

1230
