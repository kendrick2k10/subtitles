-That was good.

I think he let us stare at it
for five minutes

909

but not inside the rig.
right outside the rig.

910
00:35:16.636 --> 00:35:18.159
So that'’s the top floor.

911
00:35:18.203 --> 00:35:20.857
You run down here.
you run to my shooting range.

912

and then at my shooting range.

913
00:35:22.555 --> 00:35:24.034
I just wanted to point
this one out.

914
00:35:24.078 --> 00:35:27.037
So this is the size
some of these pigs get.

915
00:35:27.081 --> 00:35:28.778
This is around 300 pounds.

916
00:35:28.822 --> 00:35:31.651
And this was taken
back by the shooting range.

917
00:35:31.694 --> 00:35:33.653
So if you hear something
in the bushes. don'’t worry.

918
00:35:33.696 --> 00:35:35.220
but it might be
a mountain lion.

919
00:35:35.263 --> 00:35:37.178
And then there'’s. oh. snakes.
I think. too.

920
00:35:37.222 --> 00:35:38.701
There were snakes in there.

921
00:35:38.745 --> 00:35:41.878
Once I measured it out.
I saw that it was three miles.

922
00:35:41.922 --> 00:35:43.663
And I was like. "Okay.
I'’m not really happy

923

a little longer."

928
00:35:55.805 --> 00:35:57.807
And then it kind of
just hit me.

929
00:35:57.851 --> 00:36:00.897
One day I was like. "I should
just have them turn around.

930
00:36:00.941 --> 00:36:03.509
Why not run the whole thing
and then turn around

931
00:36:03.552 --> 00:36:04.901
and run it in reverse?"

932
00:36:04.945 --> 00:36:06.773

of every downhill

933
00:36:06.816 --> 00:36:09.993

00:40:36.477 --> 00:40:40.568

one more round. let'’s go."

1045
00:40:40.612 --> 00:40:42.918
And all the athletes are like.
"Oh. are you serious?"

1046
00:40:42.962 --> 00:40:46.487
"No. I'’m kidding.
go get a drink of water."

they'’re gonna figure out

1048
00:40:48.315 --> 00:40:49.882
something is going on.

1049
00:40:49.925 --> 00:40:54.060
I know Mat so well.
like the back of my hand well.

warming down

1051
00:40:57.019 --> 00:40:58.499
and going back up this hill.

1052
00:40:58.543 --> 00:41:01.110

happening here.

1053
00:41:01.154 --> 00:41:02.460

'’cause we thought

we were almost there.

Had a moment of panic.
full panic.

1056
00:41:07.943 --> 00:41:09.379
They come like.
"What'’s happening?"

1057
00:41:09.423 --> 00:41:11.947
And we were so tired.
we weren'’t saying nothing.

1058
00:41:11.991 --> 00:41:15.081
No part of my mind
right at first when I saw them

1059
00:41:15.124 --> 00:41:17.300
was like. "You'’re gonna do
the whole thing again."

1060

1061

what'’s happening here."

1064
00:41:24.438 --> 00:41:26.092
and I was like. "What'’s that?"

1065
00:41:26.135 --> 00:41:29.661
And he'’s like. "You're gonna
go and do this reverse now."

1066
00:41:29.704 --> 00:41:33.403
Uh-oh. I'’ve just gone out
way too hot.

1067
00:41:33.447 --> 00:41:35.580
You can'’t rely on
your fitness anymore.

1068
00:41:35.623 --> 00:41:36.929

your shit together

-I went in.

No. it'’s at the Ranch.

an exception to that.

that we could rally around.
especially with how hard

1236
00:48:07.972 --> 00:48:11.932
everything had been
when COVID hit.

1237
00:48:11.976 --> 00:48:14.979
Well. we'’re in Coronaland
it'’s like COVID World.

1238
00:48:15.022 --> 00:48:19.809
so the vibe this year
has been strange. weird.

1239
00:48:19.853 --> 00:48:21.724
COVID hit. threw everybody
for a loop.

1240
00:48:21.768 --> 00:48:23.204
If we'’re in the sport
of the unknown

1241

and the unknowable
and overcoming obstacles.

1242
00:48:25.424 --> 00:48:27.643
cool. we got another one
this year

1243

that probably will not
be seen again.

1244
00:48:30.037 --> 00:48:32.953
from not knowing if the games
were gonna happen

1245
00:48:32.997 --> 00:48:35.434
to not having
any training buddies.

1246

to being in your garage
for three months.

1247
00:48:38.567 --> 00:48:41.005
COVID was absolutely
devastating.

1248
00:48:41.048 --> 00:48:44.051
So as the news rolls in
that more and more countries

1249
00:48:44.095 --> 00:48:45.574
are going into lockdown.

1250
00:48:45.618 --> 00:48:48.142
what that means is thousands
of small business owners.

1251
00:48:48.186 --> 00:48:50.318
they can'’t train their clients
in person.

1252

1255

as being an affiliate owner

1256
00:49:00.633 --> 00:49:02.896
across the Big D
in Dallas. Texas.

1257
00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:04.332
It used to be a labor of love

1258
00:49:04.376 --> 00:49:07.031
and now it'’s a labor
of survival.

1259
00:49:07.074 --> 00:49:08.684
Our affiliate was shut down.

1260
00:49:08.728 --> 00:49:11.296
and my wife gave birth
to our seven-month-old now.

1261
00:49:11.339 --> 00:49:13.776
So the same week. March 19th.

1262
00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:16.779
Eighty-nine percent of all gyms
across the globe closed.

1263
00:49:16.823 --> 00:49:19.173
and 96% of all gyms
in the United States closed.

1264
00:49:19.217 --> 00:49:21.915
We were shut down
for seven months.

1265
00:49:21.959 --> 00:49:23.917
During that period. there was
a ton of pressure on CrossFit

1266
00:49:23.961 --> 00:49:25.179
to throw in the towel

1267
00:49:25.223 --> 00:49:27.268
just '’cause everybody else
was doing it.

1268
00:49:27.312 --> 00:49:30.097

of CrossFit.

00:49:32.882 --> 00:49:35.755
you saw the NBA season
get postponed.

00:49:35.798 --> 00:49:38.540
you saw the MLB season
get postponed.

1272
00:49:38.584 --> 00:49:41.761
and suddenly. it started
to kind of weigh in

1273
00:49:41.804 --> 00:49:45.025
that despite what I see

1274
00:49:45.069 --> 00:49:48.159
as a very steadfast
CrossFit community.

1275
00:49:48.202 --> 00:49:50.770
that this thing is quickly
ballooning out of our hands

1276
00:49:50.813 --> 00:49:54.382
and there may not be
a season anymore.

1277
00:49:54.426 --> 00:49:58.299
Saving the games was not
the priority. right?

1278
00:49:58.343 --> 00:50:00.475
It'’s like saving CrossFit.

1279
00:50:00.519 --> 00:50:03.783
In May of 2020. not only was
the CrossFit community

1280
00:50:03.826 --> 00:50:06.394
dealing with the COVID thing
and whether or not

1281
00:50:06.438 --> 00:50:10.529
they could--they could survive
as business affiliates

1282
00:50:10.572 --> 00:50:12.531
around the world
were shutting their doors.

1283
00:50:12.574 --> 00:50:13.532

inside the CrossFit community

1290
00:50:27.415 --> 00:50:29.069

and saying.

1291

"Hey. we want to hear
from the global entity here."

1292
00:50:31.289 --> 00:50:33.508

this intense pressure

1293
00:50:33.552 --> 00:50:37.034
through social media especially
to say something.

1294
00:50:37.077 --> 00:50:38.644
And the problem was
is CrossFit

1295
00:50:38.687 --> 00:50:41.386
is not a reactive organization.

1296
00:50:41.429 --> 00:50:43.605
Almost everything we publish
is evergreen

1297
00:50:43.649 --> 00:50:45.303
and it'’s about fitness
and nutrition

1298
00:50:45.346 --> 00:50:47.087
and things that are unchanging.

1299
00:50:47.131 --> 00:50:49.089
And we were just unprepared.
I think.

1300
00:50:49.133 --> 00:50:51.439

as a fitness company

1301

about what was going on.

1302
00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:56.705
But the fact that there was
just radio silence

1303
00:50:56.749 --> 00:50:58.490
really upset a lot of people

1304
00:50:58.533 --> 00:51:01.101
because. again.
it doesn'’t take a lot

1305
00:51:01.145 --> 00:51:04.322
just to say.

When you read sort of
the top line about Eric Roza.

1383
00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:07.418
the farther you got into it.

1384
00:54:07.461 --> 00:54:10.812
the more you thought.
"This is best-case scenario."

1385
00:54:10.856 --> 00:54:13.032
He was a successful businessman

1386
00:54:13.075 --> 00:54:14.686
and owner of an affiliate
himself.

1387
00:54:14.729 --> 00:54:17.384
and he just seems
like a good guy.

1388
00:54:17.428 --> 00:54:18.733
We talked about his Fran time.

1389
00:54:18.777 --> 00:54:20.082

really impressive.

1390

is really impressive.

Go ahead. tell the world
what your Fran time is

1392
00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:26.437

that'’s for sure.

1393
00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:28.090
You keep dwelling
on a good number

1394
00:54:28.134 --> 00:54:29.831
or you can pick some bad ones
to talk about too.

1395
00:54:29.875 --> 00:54:34.096
but yeah. after I turned 50.
I did a 2:40 Fran.

1396
00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:35.533
which I was kind of
psyched about.

1397

from CrossFit.

1399
00:54:40.407 --> 00:54:43.062
But guess what.
what CrossFit does for us

1400
00:54:43.105 --> 00:54:46.892
is so unrealistic. so we'’ve
set our own expectations

1401
00:54:46.935 --> 00:54:49.329
by being this incredible
alchemical force

1402
00:54:49.373 --> 00:54:50.896
in people'’s lives

1403
00:54:50.939 --> 00:54:53.333

of people

1404
00:54:53.377 --> 00:54:57.119

that we do have this magic

1405
00:54:57.163 --> 00:54:58.643
and we are unrealistic.

1406
00:54:58.686 --> 00:55:01.385
So then the question was.
"How do we live up to that?"

1407

to burst the bubble.
