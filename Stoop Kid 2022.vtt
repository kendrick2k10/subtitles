00:01:47.503 --> 00:01:50.533
- [Narrator] Survival is
the greatest human instinct.

38
00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:54.717
Humans and animals use
deception in order to survive.

39
00:01:54.717 --> 00:01:56.986
Surviving Oakland was not for the weak.

40
00:01:56.986 --> 00:01:59.752
You either had to walk on water to escape.

41
00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:02.370
or burn everything down with fire.

42
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.568
and we really good at burning shit.

43
00:02:05.568 --> 00:02:08.194
I survived Oakland because
the furnace inside me

44
00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:11.962
nurtured a greater glow
than the fires around me.

45
00:02:11.962 --> 00:02:14.529
For me. scamming was
about breaking the system

46
00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:18.443
and showing how smart you
are for figuring it out.

47
00:02:18.443 --> 00:02:20.960
The old heads had their way.

48
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.739
they were either taking what you bought.

49
00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.067
selling what they cooked. or grew.

50
00:02:25.067 --> 00:02:28.007
some niggas was even selling you.

51
00:02:28.007 --> 00:02:30.864
My generation had a more elegant way.

52
00:02:30.864 --> 00:02:33.107
What's the common denominator?

53
00:02:33.107 --> 00:02:36.357
Money. and we found a way to take that.

54
00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:39.954
Without my momma or my daddy present.

55
00:02:39.954 --> 00:02:42.308
I had to figure it out.

56
00:02:42.308 --> 00:02:45.161
And when it came to finessing

57
00:02:45.161 --> 00:02:47.658
Turns out I was a genius.

my brothers. and my sister.

78
00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:30.998
I was just a kid trying to raise kids.

79
00:03:30.998 --> 00:03:32.434
so making money in the hood

80
00:03:32.434 --> 00:03:35.355
required a higher level of creativity.

81
00:03:35.355 --> 00:03:38.251

sliding for them gift cards.

so when I make that purchase.
I'm not losing the money.

84
00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:45.155
The funny thing about robbing digitally

85
00:03:45.155 --> 00:03:47.083
is that they expect it (chuckles).

86
00:03:47.083 --> 00:03:48.816

but with a smile and a story.

91
00:03:56.905 --> 00:04:00.836
I wasn't a criminal
(chuckles). I was a caretaker.

92
00:04:00.836 --> 00:04:05.098
I fed my demons. the same
way white people feed theirs.

93
00:04:05.098 --> 00:04:07.584
theft and deception.

94
00:04:07.584 --> 00:04:09.520

we used to throw "Project X"

The greatest money play. until
the police hit us (laughs).

166
00:06:51.043 --> 00:06:55.466
then once we was back broke.
it was back to the bitches.

171
00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:09.532

Being biracial was a super power.

350
00:14:51.022 --> 00:14:54.662
It allowed me to be a part
of two different worlds

352

and that was an advantage.

353
00:15:01.242 --> 00:15:02.075
When you're a kid.

354
00:15:02.075 --> 00:15:04.509
you look at the world
as one big adventure.

355
00:15:04.509 --> 00:15:07.758
unbound and with nothing to stop you.

356
00:15:07.758 --> 00:15:09.864
The child's mind is so positive

358
00:15:11.693 --> 00:15:13.921

359
00:15:13.921 --> 00:15:16.669

until I got older.

00:15:25.484 --> 00:15:28.614
I didn't know I was supposed
to be a basketball player

364
00:15:28.614 --> 00:15:30.464
because I looked like one.

365
00:15:30.464 --> 00:15:33.206
I didn't know I was supposed
to behave a certain way

366
00:15:33.206 --> 00:15:35.206
because of how I looked.

367
00:15:36.372 --> 00:15:39.369
I remember when my mom
picked me and my grandma up

368
00:15:39.369 --> 00:15:40.478

I sneaked to Greg's house.

420

the police had to bring
back all his plants.

471
00:21:05.655 --> 00:21:07.841

475
00:21:14.883 --> 00:21:16.344

00:21:16.344 --> 00:21:18.557
and sued the drawers
off the city (chuckles).

477
00:21:18.557 --> 00:21:21.565
He got all his weed back from the police.

478

that's the power company in the Bay.

480
00:21:27.068 --> 00:21:28.714
It was one of their maintenance workers

481
00:21:28.714 --> 00:21:31.873
who tipped off the police on Uncle Greg.

482
00:21:31.873 --> 00:21:34.554

information to the police

for sure rubbed off on me.

487
00:21:44.772 --> 00:21:46.628
He had a millionaire's
prayer that he wrote.

488
00:21:46.628 --> 00:21:48.966
and it was about how his millionaire seed

would come to fruition (laughs).

We would hold hands at the
dinner table. saying grace.

491
00:21:54.485 --> 00:21:55.980
and he made everybody hold hands

492
00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:59.510
while he prayed for himself.

493
00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:01.614
