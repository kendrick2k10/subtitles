3
00:01:46.578 --> 00:01:48.347
- George
Washington was a bitch.

4
00:01:50.351 --> 00:01:53.517
- Hey. guys. can we not
degrade the president.

5
00:01:53.552 --> 00:01:55.519
the first president
of the United States?

6
00:01:55.554 --> 00:01:57.620
- Like a straight up bitch.

7
00:01:57.655 --> 00:01:59.490
- Miguel. language.

8
00:01:59.525 --> 00:02:00.524
- Sorry. Mr. Dunbar.

9
00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:02.262
- All right.

10
00:02:02.297 --> 00:02:06.398
you obviously have pretty
strong views on Washington.

11
00:02:07.467 --> 00:02:09.599
as you should. as
you have a right to.

12
00:02:09.634 --> 00:02:13.603
Can someone share
their thoughts on that?

13
00:02:13.638 --> 00:02:15.407
- Slaves. duh.

14
00:02:15.442 --> 00:02:16.606
- Slaves. good.

15
00:02:16.641 --> 00:02:17.904
- Slaves are good?

16
00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:19.543
- Miguel. I obviously
wasn't saying

17
00:02:19.578 --> 00:02:20.973
that slavery was good.

18
00:02:21.008 --> 00:02:22.546
Go ahead. Sadie.
- What?

19
00:02:23.912 --> 00:02:25.714
- You were talking
about Washington.

20
00:02:26.816 --> 00:02:30.554
- Oh. well. I mean.
he had slaves.

21
00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:32.721
and I mean. yeah. he did
all these great things

22
00:02:32.756 --> 00:02:35.229
like he killed British people

23
00:02:35.264 --> 00:02:38.430
and he made more dirt
roads or whatever.

24
00:02:38.465 --> 00:02:41.268
but slaves cut down the
trees to make the roads.

25
00:02:41.303 --> 00:02:42.467
He didn't pay them.

26
00:02:42.502 --> 00:02:44.271
- And that's deforestation.

27
00:02:44.306 --> 00:02:45.833
like the rainforests in Brazil.

28
00:02:45.868 --> 00:02:47.538
It's really bad.

29
00:02:47.573 --> 00:02:49.639
- Didn't he also bang
a few of his slaves?

30
00:02:49.674 --> 00:02:50.273
- No. that was John F. Kennedy.

31
00:02:50.308 --> 00:02:52.642
- That wasn't JF...

32
00:02:53.975 --> 00:02:55.282
Guys. I think.

33
00:02:56.483 --> 00:02:58.681
I think if we can
look at Washington

34
00:02:58.716 --> 00:03:02.652
through the prism of
being a fallible human.

35
00:03:02.687 --> 00:03:05.292
like a lot of our
historical figures.

36
00:03:05.327 --> 00:03:06.359
they weren't superheroes.

37
00:03:06.394 --> 00:03:07.723
These were people.

38
00:03:07.758 --> 00:03:10.990
They were. they were messy
and they were complicated.

39
00:03:11.025 --> 00:03:12.530
but I think if we look

40
00:03:12.565 --> 00:03:15.401
at his accomplishments
with his flaws.

41
00:03:16.338 --> 00:03:18.030
I think that we can all relate

42
00:03:18.065 --> 00:03:19.669
to Washington a little more.

43
00:03:25.644 --> 00:03:28.007
- I don't know. Still
seems like a bitch.

44
00:03:33.454 --> 00:03:35.685
- All right. let's
wrap it up. okay?

45
00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.523
Do me a favor. get your
essays in my Dropbox

46
00:03:38.558 --> 00:03:40.327
tomorrow by- 00 PM

47
00:03:40.362 --> 00:03:41.592
or I'm docking you guys

48
00:03:41.627 --> 00:03:43.726
10 points per day. okay?

49
00:03:44.762 --> 00:03:45.926
Bye-bye.

50
00:04:34.075 --> 00:04:36.009
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hey. it's okay.

51
00:04:36.044 --> 00:04:37.351
You texted me. It's fine.

52
00:04:37.386 --> 00:04:38.814
- I had a meeting run over.

53
00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:41.047
My boss was rambling. so.

54
00:04:41.082 --> 00:04:43.621
- It's okay. Thank
you for bringing her.

55
00:04:43.656 --> 00:04:44.820
- Hi. Daddy!

56
00:04:44.855 --> 00:04:46.019
- Hi. baby!

57
00:04:46.054 --> 00:04:47.592
- She's with me all day now.

58
00:04:47.627 --> 00:04:48.989
- Yeah?
- Because of preschool. yeah.

59
00:04:49.024 --> 00:04:50.661
- What happened?
Did they quarantine?

60
00:04:50.696 --> 00:04:52.498
- No. precautionary
for a couple of weeks

61
00:04:52.533 --> 00:04:53.367
till the numbers go down.

62
00:04:53.402 --> 00:04:54.698
which is fine.
- Oh.

63
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.932
- Look. we're
violating the order

64
00:04:57.967 --> 00:04:59.098
by me even being here.

65
00:04:59.133 --> 00:05:01.738
but I know you'd wanna see her.

66
00:05:01.773 --> 00:05:03.806
so now you've seen her.
- Well. thank you.

67
00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:08.745
- Uh. I'm
keeping their original.

68
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.043
but the lawyer
says the court copy

69
00:05:10.078 --> 00:05:11.649
is just fine for...

70
00:05:11.684 --> 00:05:13.750
Where is your mask?

71
00:05:14.654 --> 00:05:15.554
- It's in the car.

72
00:05:16.623 --> 00:05:17.754
- Did you wanna put it on?

73
00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:19.723
- Not really.

74
00:05:19.758 --> 00:05:21.153
I'm in my apartment
all day teaching.

75
00:05:21.188 --> 00:05:22.088
I don't go anywhere.

76
00:05:22.123 --> 00:05:24.530
- Still. the optics matter.

77
00:05:24.565 --> 00:05:25.993
People see you.

78
00:05:26.028 --> 00:05:29.370
- Okay. well. I'll take
that under advisement.

79
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.538
You look really good.

80
00:05:33.706 --> 00:05:36.905
I mean. your eyes
do. your forehead.

81
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.742
You got a haircut.
I can tell that.

82
00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:42.647
- How has teaching been?

83
00:05:42.682 --> 00:05:45.683
- Um. it's been all right.

84
00:05:45.718 --> 00:05:47.784
Challenging. I'm
getting through it.

85
00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:50.017
Oh. hey. come here for a second.

86
00:05:50.052 --> 00:05:51.018
I brought you this.

87
00:05:55.024 --> 00:05:57.827
You left it when you picked
up your last few boxes.

88
00:05:58.863 --> 00:06:00.764
- Well. I can't fit in my
car. Can you disassemble it?

89
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.867
- I can. not fast.

90
00:06:06.541 --> 00:06:07.738
I can just bring it by.
- No.

91
00:06:07.773 --> 00:06:09.443
- I don't even
have to come inside

92
00:06:09.478 --> 00:06:11.071
if you-
- No. it's not a good idea.

93
00:06:12.844 --> 00:06:13.942
- Why isn't it a good idea?

94
00:06:16.881 --> 00:06:17.781
- You know why.

95
00:06:24.218 --> 00:06:27.087
- So is he like. is
he parked in my space?

96
00:06:27.122 --> 00:06:30.761
- No. he is parked in what
is now my extra space.

97
00:06:31.863 --> 00:06:33.027
You call the therapist yet?

98
00:06:34.734 --> 00:06:35.568
- Fuck you. Kim.

99
00:06:37.836 --> 00:06:40.474
- Nice. Nice. you know what?

100
00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:42.201
- Hmm?
- Keep the bike. sell it.

101
00:06:42.236 --> 00:06:43.136
Whatever you want.

102
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.874
- Thanks.

103
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.140
- That's it. then.

104
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.519
Say bye to Daddy.

105
00:06:53.588 --> 00:06:54.917
- Bye. baby. I love you.

106
00:06:54.952 --> 00:06:56.248
- I love you.

107
00:07:18.646 --> 00:07:19.876
- What are you doing?

108
00:07:19.911 --> 00:07:22.912
- Mm. well. there was
an outbreak on campus.

109
00:07:22.947 --> 00:07:23.847
They sent us all home.

110
00:07:25.554 --> 00:07:26.949
- Well. you have to get tested.

111
00:07:26.984 --> 00:07:29.116
- No. it was a night custodian.

112
00:07:29.151 --> 00:07:30.821
All of us in the
counseling office

113
00:07:30.856 --> 00:07:32.020
aren't on his rotation.

114
00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:36.794
- So what did they
do with the school?

115
00:07:36.829 --> 00:07:38.125
- They
wanna play it safe.

116
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.094
so they shut it down.

117
00:07:40.129 --> 00:07:42.734
It's gonna be a ghost town
for at least a few weeks.

118
00:07:42.769 --> 00:07:44.934
It looks like you're
stuck with me.

119
00:07:44.969 --> 00:07:47.233
- Oh. the horror.

120
00:07:47.268 --> 00:07:49.543
- I've got two more
bags in the car.

121
00:07:49.578 --> 00:07:50.742
Mind taking a break

122
00:07:50.777 --> 00:07:52.942
from your busy studies
and grabbing them?

123
00:07:52.977 --> 00:07:53.877
- I gotcha.

124
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:12.764
- Ah!

125
00:08:47.636 --> 00:08:51.638
Yeah.

126
00:08:54.643 --> 00:08:55.268
Hello?

127
00:08:57.041 --> 00:08:59.646
- Yeah. no. I'm fine.

128
00:09:00.682 --> 00:09:05.619
I'm fine. just having some
technical issues over here.

129
00:09:05.654 --> 00:09:06.884
I'm logging on now.

130
00:09:07.986 --> 00:09:10.723
Yeah. Fuck.

131
00:09:10.758 --> 00:09:11.988
Huh? No. no. no. I'm...

132
00:09:13.728 --> 00:09:18.258
I. uh. I understand
that the parents

133
00:09:18.293 --> 00:09:21.767
are calling you nonstop
right now. I get it.

134
00:09:21.802 --> 00:09:23.032
I also understand that you

135
00:09:23.067 --> 00:09:26.970
have better things to be
doing during a pandemic.

136
00:09:27.005 --> 00:09:29.071
I'm not fucking stupid.

137
00:09:34.342 --> 00:09:36.683
Listen. the last time
I checked. I'm a.

138
00:09:36.718 --> 00:09:38.685
I was a history teacher.

139
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.853
not a fucking IT guy. okay?

140
00:09:41.888 --> 00:09:43.019
I'm doing the best
that I can here.

141
00:09:43.054 --> 00:09:45.285
If it's not good enough for you.

142
00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.924
you call my union rep.

143
00:09:57.739 --> 00:09:58.969
Hey everybody. sorry.

144
00:09:59.004 --> 00:10:00.674
I'm sorry that I'm late.

145
00:10:00.709 --> 00:10:04.106
Um. a little technical issue.

146
00:10:04.141 --> 00:10:06.647
Uh. let's turn to page 248.

147
00:10:42.344 --> 00:10:45.081
Gee. you want tech
support. motherfucker. huh?

148
00:10:45.116 --> 00:10:47.116
Yeah? Did you reboot it?

149
00:10:49.857 --> 00:10:51.725
Did you. did you restart it?

150
00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.485
Did you fucking restart it. huh?

151
00:11:05.004 --> 00:11:06.465
- I fucking wanna get COVID.

152
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.434
I'm serious. I'll kick its ass.

153
00:11:08.469 --> 00:11:10.502
- It's the invisibles
diatribe again?

154
00:11:10.537 --> 00:11:13.109
- I am. I placed third in
the last MMA tournament.

155
00:11:13.144 --> 00:11:14.308
in case anyone forgot.

156
00:11:14.343 --> 00:11:16.816
- Yeah. you're a black
belt in douchebag.

157
00:11:16.851 --> 00:11:18.048
Every night before
I fall asleep.

158
00:11:18.083 --> 00:11:20.215
I seriously think why
don't break up with you.

159
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.151
- I bet that's not
all you think about in bed.

160
00:11:22.186 --> 00:11:25.088
- Ugh. Thanks for
getting my burger.

161
00:11:25.123 --> 00:11:26.122
I'll get you back next time.

162
00:11:26.157 --> 00:11:27.794
- It's fine. Don't
worry about it.

163
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:29.961
- Aah. I'm gonna
fucking die of boredom

164
00:11:29.996 --> 00:11:31.127
before I die of COVID.

165
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.460
You know what we should do?

166
00:11:34.495 --> 00:11:36.132
Throw a party. get fucked up.

167
00:11:36.167 --> 00:11:39.003
- Where? Everyone's
home. parents too.

168
00:11:39.038 --> 00:11:40.807
- There's the old
warehouse on 18th.

169
00:11:40.842 --> 00:11:42.402
- It has a security guard.

170
00:11:42.437 --> 00:11:43.810
- How do you know?

171
00:11:43.845 --> 00:11:45.372
- I take walks with
my mom at night.

172
00:11:45.407 --> 00:11:48.012
I always see a security
guard out there texting.

173
00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:50.377
- What other buildings

174
00:11:50.412 --> 00:11:51.917
are empty 'cause of COVID?

175
00:11:54.988 --> 00:11:56.251
- Schools.

176
00:11:56.286 --> 00:11:58.055
- Yeah. but schools have
like maintenance men there.

177
00:11:59.157 --> 00:12:00.827
- Actually. no. they don't.

178
00:12:00.862 --> 00:12:02.521
At least not ours.
They shut it down.

179
00:12:02.556 --> 00:12:04.160
- What are you talking about?

180
00:12:04.195 --> 00:12:05.865
- My mom said some
janitor caught the virus.

181
00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.065
so they're not take any chances.

182
00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:11.200
- So what. is totally empty?

183
00:12:11.235 --> 00:12:13.169
- It's school. guys.
It's not a rave venue.

184
00:12:13.204 --> 00:12:15.204
- That's why it's perfect.

185
00:12:15.239 --> 00:12:16.909
If there was just
an outbreak there.

186
00:12:16.944 --> 00:12:17.943
then no one's gonna
go near that place

187
00:12:17.978 --> 00:12:19.076
for at least a few days.

188
00:12:19.111 --> 00:12:20.407
This shit's like radioactive.

189
00:12:20.442 --> 00:12:23.113
- That's hardly a
compelling argument

190
00:12:23.148 --> 00:12:24.246
for us to go ourselves.

191
00:12:25.215 --> 00:12:27.854
- Trevor. did you sell
your paintball guns yet?

192
00:12:27.889 --> 00:12:29.053
- Not yet.

193
00:12:29.088 --> 00:12:30.549
- There we go!

194
00:12:30.584 --> 00:12:33.024
We'll get drunk and tag up
the school with pellets.

195
00:12:33.059 --> 00:12:34.124
- That's stupid.

196
00:12:34.159 --> 00:12:35.862
- Oh. come on.

197
00:12:35.897 --> 00:12:38.062
They closed the paintball
park since the pandemic.

198
00:12:38.097 --> 00:12:40.130
I know you miss going.

199
00:12:40.165 --> 00:12:42.033
It's like the only loser
thing you're good at.

200
00:12:42.068 --> 00:12:43.101
- Thanks pal.

201
00:12:43.136 --> 00:12:45.234
- I mean. you have to
impress Sadie with something.

202
00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:46.840
- Don't be an asshole.

203
00:12:46.875 --> 00:12:49.436
- No. I. I think
it could be fun.

204
00:12:49.471 --> 00:12:52.076
We should do it.
- I don't know.

205
00:12:52.111 --> 00:12:54.012
My mom works in the
counseling office.

206
00:12:54.047 --> 00:12:55.882
It could mess with her
job if we get caught.

207
00:12:55.917 --> 00:12:57.444
- We're not gonna get caught.

208
00:12:57.479 --> 00:12:58.852
And if someone shows up.

209
00:12:58.887 --> 00:13:00.315
we'll just go out a
side door or something.

210
00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:02.383
We can outrun any
old-ass janitor. right?

211
00:13:03.551 --> 00:13:04.825
Now. I know you're in.

212
00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.157
Are you in?

213
00:13:07.192 --> 00:13:08.554
- Only if Trevor is in.

214
00:13:08.589 --> 00:13:09.522
- This pussy's in.

215
00:13:09.557 --> 00:13:10.897
- Hey!

216
00:13:10.932 --> 00:13:11.865
- Sorry!

217
00:13:13.231 --> 00:13:14.395
- Hey. why
aren't you wearing your masks?

218
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:15.627
- We're good. bro.

219
00:13:15.662 --> 00:13:16.936
It's just like study pods.

220
00:13:16.971 --> 00:13:18.135
a little herd immunity here.

221
00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:20.236
- You
should wear your masks.

222
00:13:20.271 --> 00:13:21.875
- I'm safe. dog. I promise.

223
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:24.273
I wear a condom at least
like half the time.

224
00:13:24.308 --> 00:13:25.406
- You're gonna get your ass

225
00:13:25.441 --> 00:13:28.277
kicked one of these
days with that mouth!

226
00:13:28.312 --> 00:13:30.477
- We're teenagers.
We're invincible.

227
00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:34.580
- I'm just saying. if the
British didn't have guns

228
00:13:34.615 --> 00:13:36.417
and the Americans
didn't have guns.

229
00:13:36.452 --> 00:13:39.189
then the militia wouldn't
have needed guns.

230
00:13:39.224 --> 00:13:41.290
- Right? I totally
agree. but they did.

231
00:13:41.325 --> 00:13:44.029
I mean. those are the origins
of the Second Amendment.

232
00:13:44.064 --> 00:13:46.196
- Well. it's ridiculous.

233
00:13:46.231 --> 00:13:48.396
I'm sorry. I don't know.

234
00:13:48.431 --> 00:13:49.628
- No. don't say that.

235
00:13:49.663 --> 00:13:51.168
I like it. I like
it when you open up

236
00:13:51.203 --> 00:13:53.170
with your thoughts like that.

237
00:13:53.205 --> 00:13:56.272
it's. uh. it's refreshing.

238
00:13:56.307 --> 00:13:58.076
it's refreshing and charming.

239
00:13:59.343 --> 00:14:03.246
So I think. I think
the argument with guns

240
00:14:03.281 --> 00:14:07.349
is that they were a
natural right for citizens.

241
00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:12.519
for them to be able
to protect themselves.

242
00:14:12.554 --> 00:14:14.521
to feel safe. to
feel like they have

243
00:14:14.556 --> 00:14:16.897
some sort of control
of their future.

244
00:14:17.625 --> 00:14:18.492
- Do you own one?

245
00:14:21.134 --> 00:14:23.101
- I don't think my. uh.

246
00:14:23.136 --> 00:14:25.433
my feelings or my hobbies

247
00:14:25.468 --> 00:14:29.140
should intermingle with
our class discussions.

248
00:14:29.175 --> 00:14:30.273
- That's a yes.

249
00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.310
- I think the amendment was

250
00:14:34.345 --> 00:14:37.049
to protect citizens
from everyone.

251
00:14:37.084 --> 00:14:38.281
You know. governments.

252
00:14:38.316 --> 00:14:40.481
governments were
not always honest

253
00:14:40.516 --> 00:14:44.089
and the most well-intentioned
with their countrymen.

254
00:14:44.124 --> 00:14:45.959
- Hello? Gender-neutral.

255
00:14:45.994 --> 00:14:47.488
Country-people. please.

256
00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.227
- Country-people.

257
00:14:51.362 --> 00:14:53.197
Thank you. Genesis.

258
00:14:53.232 --> 00:14:54.132
- I don't know.

259
00:14:54.167 --> 00:14:55.331
- Stop saying you don't know.

260
00:14:55.366 --> 00:14:56.530
Tell us what you think.

261
00:14:57.698 --> 00:15:00.336
- I just don't wanna
get shot. right?

262
00:15:00.371 --> 00:15:01.403
One thing about the pandemic.

263
00:15:01.438 --> 00:15:02.635
at least you don't have to hear

264
00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:05.044
about a school getting
shot up every month.

265
00:15:05.079 --> 00:15:06.980
That's one thing you
don't have to worry about.

266
00:15:07.015 --> 00:15:08.344
- That's a good point.

267
00:15:08.379 --> 00:15:09.543
- That is a good point.

268
00:15:11.349 --> 00:15:13.382
You know. I don't always
agree with your opinions.

269
00:15:13.417 --> 00:15:15.318
but they're. they're always
really well thought out.

270
00:15:15.353 --> 00:15:17.320
they're. they're salient.

271
00:15:20.655 --> 00:15:24.624
All right. should we head
to our breakout boxes now?

272
00:15:30.269 --> 00:15:31.763
- What about- 00 PM?

273
00:15:31.798 --> 00:15:34.040
- Later. my dad
will be downstairs

274
00:15:34.075 --> 00:15:37.406
until at least
- 30 watching TV.

275
00:15:37.441 --> 00:15:38.671
Sadie. can you come over?

276
00:15:38.706 --> 00:15:40.310
- Yeah. my aunt's cool with it.

277
00:15:40.345 --> 00:15:41.575
I'll be there around six.

278
00:15:43.447 --> 00:15:45.051
- Trevor. you good
for tomorrow night?

279
00:15:45.086 --> 00:15:46.283
- Yeah.

280
00:15:46.318 --> 00:15:47.713
- You gonna
bring the paintball guns?

281
00:15:47.748 --> 00:15:49.418
- I'll bring 'em. dog.

282
00:15:49.453 --> 00:15:51.057
- And what
about your mom's key?

283
00:15:51.092 --> 00:15:52.289
- What do you mean?

284
00:15:52.324 --> 00:15:53.156
- Well. we're
not gonna break windows

285
00:15:53.192 --> 00:15:55.325
to get into the school
to play paintball.

286
00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.260
We need your key.

287
00:15:56.295 --> 00:15:58.394
- Dude. Come on. man.

288
00:15:58.429 --> 00:15:59.626
- Don't pressure him.

289
00:15:59.661 --> 00:16:01.166
- Look. It's fine.

290
00:16:01.201 --> 00:16:03.234
I'll get 'em. I'll get 'em.

291
00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:05.335
- I mean. if you can't.
we can always get Sadie

292
00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:06.336
to blow Mr. Dunbar for his set.

293
00:16:06.371 --> 00:16:09.141
- Miguel! You're a pig.

294
00:16:09.176 --> 00:16:10.538
- That is so
not cool you said that.

295
00:16:10.573 --> 00:16:12.342
- Whatever. he's always like.

296
00:16:12.377 --> 00:16:13.640
"Sadie. please go on.

297
00:16:13.675 --> 00:16:15.477
Sadie. please. we wanna
hear what you have to say.

298
00:16:15.512 --> 00:16:16.676
Sadie. when school starts.

299
00:16:16.711 --> 00:16:18.282
can you wear a shorter
skirt so I can try

300
00:16:18.317 --> 00:16:20.251
and catch a glimpse
of your panties?"

301
00:16:20.286 --> 00:16:22.583
- You're inappropriate.

302
00:16:22.618 --> 00:16:23.683
- And disgusting.

303
00:16:23.718 --> 00:16:26.620
- I'm joking. Right. Trevor?

304
00:16:26.655 --> 00:16:28.127
- Don't involve me.

305
00:16:28.162 --> 00:16:29.392
- You're an asshole.

306
00:16:29.427 --> 00:16:31.196
- I'm sorry. I'm joking.

307
00:16:31.231 --> 00:16:33.627
I'm joking. Sades.
but not about him.

308
00:16:33.662 --> 00:16:34.661
The dude's a fucking weirdo

309
00:16:34.696 --> 00:16:36.333
who certainly jacks off

310
00:16:36.368 --> 00:16:37.730
to what you look like
clothed. much less naked.

311
00:16:37.765 --> 00:16:39.534
- Okay.
you need to stop.

312
00:16:39.569 --> 00:16:41.338
- Oh. he's not a creep?

313
00:16:41.373 --> 00:16:43.241
- He's gross. but
that's not the point.

314
00:16:43.276 --> 00:16:44.473
The point is you're
being a dick.

315
00:16:44.508 --> 00:16:45.771
and you need to stop.

316
00:16:45.806 --> 00:16:48.477
- His wife left him.
- What?

317
00:16:48.512 --> 00:16:50.479
- Yeah. my mom told me he's
going through a divorce.

318
00:16:50.514 --> 00:16:52.316
I guess he's got rage issues.

319
00:16:52.351 --> 00:16:53.515
I mean. we never knew

320
00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:54.450
'cause we didn't have
a class with him.

321
00:16:54.485 --> 00:16:56.485
but supposedly he went nuts

322
00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.125
on a teacher's aid that
came in high last year.

323
00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.489
- Are you serious?

324
00:17:00.524 --> 00:17:01.787
- But what
did dumbass Dunbar do?

325
00:17:01.822 --> 00:17:04.427
- I don't know. I know
he got written up for it.

326
00:17:04.462 --> 00:17:06.396
I think the charge is
still pending. though.

327
00:17:06.431 --> 00:17:07.330
- There it is.

328
00:17:07.366 --> 00:17:10.334
The dude's a fucking
psycho. Mystery solved.

329
00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:12.138
- Don't be-
- What?

330
00:17:12.173 --> 00:17:14.833
No. Sadie. Please continue.

331
00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:18.375
- I'm just saying he seems okay.

332
00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:19.739
He's just sad.

333
00:17:19.774 --> 00:17:22.412
We all go through
hard times sometimes.

334
00:17:22.447 --> 00:17:23.545
- Oh. you wanna fuck him?

335
00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:25.283
- Miguel. I'm dead serious.

336
00:17:25.318 --> 00:17:26.779
you want a hand job
before summer break.

337
00:17:26.814 --> 00:17:28.319
it's gonna be a miracle.

338
00:17:28.354 --> 00:17:30.717
- Fine.
Next up. please.

339
00:17:30.752 --> 00:17:31.883
- Really?

340
00:17:31.918 --> 00:17:33.324
- You know what?
You're right. Miguel.

341
00:17:33.359 --> 00:17:34.292
Fuck that fool. man.

342
00:17:34.327 --> 00:17:35.854
- That's what I'm saying.

343
00:17:35.889 --> 00:17:38.230
- No. fuck how he
talks to Sadie.

344
00:17:38.265 --> 00:17:39.198
It's messed up.

345
00:17:40.564 --> 00:17:41.794
I don't give a damn that
he's having marital problems.

346
00:17:41.829 --> 00:17:43.697
Maybe his wife
left his loser ass

347
00:17:43.732 --> 00:17:46.436
because she knows he like
to fuck with the students.

348
00:17:46.471 --> 00:17:48.174
Don't be a creep and shit
won't happen like that.

349
00:17:48.209 --> 00:17:48.834
It's karma.

350
00:17:48.869 --> 00:17:50.572
- Heard that.

351
00:17:50.607 --> 00:17:53.311
- Yeah.
he's fucking creepy.

352
00:17:53.346 --> 00:17:54.543
You know. if we
go back to school.

353
00:17:54.578 --> 00:17:55.610
I might just lie and
say he touched me

354
00:17:55.645 --> 00:17:57.546
if he makes me
feel uncomfortable.

355
00:17:58.615 --> 00:18:02.650
- Whoa. you guys are more
coldblooded than me. Damn!

356
00:18:32.484 --> 00:18:34.583
- What the fuck is this?

357
00:18:34.618 --> 00:18:36.552
Oh. come on. dude. Really?

358
00:18:40.822 --> 00:18:44.659
Dude. come on man. Move over.

359
00:18:45.563 --> 00:18:47.398
What the fuck. dude?

360
00:18:47.433 --> 00:18:48.663
Seriously. man.

361
00:18:48.698 --> 00:18:49.763
Fucking move over.

362
00:18:53.835 --> 00:18:55.604
What the fuck. man?

363
00:18:55.639 --> 00:18:57.672
Dude. what the fuck. man?
- Pedestrians have

364
00:18:57.707 --> 00:18:58.937
the right of way.

365
00:18:58.972 --> 00:18:59.740
- Oh yeah. you gonna
fucking hit my car.

366
00:18:59.775 --> 00:19:00.972
you fucking pedestrian?

367
00:19:01.007 --> 00:19:03.612
Really?
- Okay. I'm sorry

368
00:19:03.647 --> 00:19:04.679
that I hit your car. okay?
- Yeah. yeah.

369
00:19:04.714 --> 00:19:06.351
you are fucking sorry. man.

370
00:19:06.386 --> 00:19:07.979
- I'm fucking jogging because
I'm a little stressed out.

371
00:19:08.014 --> 00:19:10.421
- Right. listen. I don't give
a shit about your stress.

372
00:19:10.456 --> 00:19:11.818
You don't hit my
car. you understand?

373
00:19:11.853 --> 00:19:12.951
- I understand. yeah.

374
00:19:12.986 --> 00:19:15.294
- What the fuck? Dude!

375
00:19:15.329 --> 00:19:16.493
- Fuck you. shithead!
- Fuck you!

376
00:19:16.528 --> 00:19:17.626
Dude. what the fuck?

377
00:19:17.661 --> 00:19:19.430
- Fuck you. Florida bitch!
- What the f-

378
00:19:23.766 --> 00:19:26.272
- Oh. oh. oh shit.

379
00:19:26.934 --> 00:19:28.670
What are you fucking-

380
00:19:29.673 --> 00:19:33.741
- Hey.

381
00:19:33.776 --> 00:19:36.513
Listen. Nobody's gonna
fucking come here

382
00:19:36.548 --> 00:19:37.646
and help you. okay?

383
00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.353
So. you go fuck yourself.

384
00:20:17.325 --> 00:20:17.950
- Mr. Dunbar?

385
00:20:24.695 --> 00:20:25.529
- Sorry.

386
00:20:26.565 --> 00:20:27.630
- What do you think?

387
00:20:28.567 --> 00:20:29.764
- About what?

388
00:20:29.799 --> 00:20:30.798
The internet connection was.

389
00:20:30.833 --> 00:20:32.965
uh. was not great.

390
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.671
I didn't. I didn't
hear what you said.

391
00:20:35.706 --> 00:20:37.673
- I was talking about
when Washington died.

392
00:20:37.708 --> 00:20:39.807
the dilemma the country was in.

393
00:20:39.842 --> 00:20:41.380
- What dilemma?

394
00:20:41.415 --> 00:20:42.810
- I mean. I don't know.

395
00:20:44.451 --> 00:20:46.682
- Don't say you
don't know. Sadie.

396
00:20:46.717 --> 00:20:48.717
Come on. Tell us. tell
us what you think.

397
00:20:50.589 --> 00:20:53.689
- It seems he was
a soldier at heart.

398
00:20:54.425 --> 00:20:56.692
Maybe not the smartest
guy in the room.

399
00:20:56.727 --> 00:20:57.825
but the most capable.

400
00:20:59.664 --> 00:21:01.532
I mean. maybe
that's what it takes

401
00:21:01.567 --> 00:21:03.534
to be a strong leader.

402
00:21:03.569 --> 00:21:07.604
He never thought that he
was smarter than he was.

403
00:21:07.639 --> 00:21:10.607
He seemed grateful. even simple.

404
00:21:12.776 --> 00:21:14.875
- Grateful for what?

405
00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:17.647
- For the hope of what things
could be for the country.

406
00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:21.585
- So you're saying that he
knew his place in history?

407
00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:25.820
- Exactly. he died
knowing he made his mark.

408
00:21:25.855 --> 00:21:29.362
His hubris wasn't such
that he needed to be king.

409
00:21:32.532 --> 00:21:33.663
- Yeah. yeah.

410
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:35.731
I totally agree with that.

411
00:21:38.703 --> 00:21:41.539
All right. that's enough.

412
00:21:41.574 --> 00:21:43.134
Thank you. Thank you. Sadie.

413
00:21:43.169 --> 00:21:45.675
And everyone have
a good weekend.

414
00:23:11.961 --> 00:23:13.158
- That
a way. that a way.

415
00:23:13.193 --> 00:23:13.961
that a way. that
a way. that a way!

416
00:23:13.996 --> 00:23:15.567
- You gonna get that?

417
00:23:16.262 --> 00:23:17.833
- It's your door.

418
00:23:19.639 --> 00:23:22.442
- Really?

419
00:23:24.039 --> 00:23:26.545
Okay. All right. don't do it.

420
00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:27.513
Just sit there.

421
00:23:30.177 --> 00:23:31.682
- I'm watching the game. dammit.

422
00:23:31.717 --> 00:23:32.848
- Yeah? Yeah?

423
00:23:42.794 --> 00:23:43.628
Hello?

424
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:15.957
- Is everything okay?

425
00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.597
- No. not at all.

426
00:24:20.832 --> 00:24:21.864
- Go inside.

427
00:24:35.011 --> 00:24:36.109
- I can't
believe I'm saying this.

428
00:24:36.144 --> 00:24:38.144
but I kinda miss this place.

429
00:24:42.854 --> 00:24:46.086
- Wait.
the lights are on.

430
00:24:46.121 --> 00:24:47.219
Trevor. are you
sure no one's here?

431
00:24:47.254 --> 00:24:50.321
- Um. that's what my mom said.

432
00:24:53.194 --> 00:24:55.667
- See something? That's-
- Guys-

433
00:24:55.702 --> 00:24:56.767
- That's. that's a cart.
- Guys.

434
00:24:56.802 --> 00:24:58.934
- Let's go. Go. go.
- Sh. sh.

435
00:25:08.649 --> 00:25:09.945
- What are you doing?

436
00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.717
- He'll move back around.
We don't have time to run.

437
00:25:12.752 --> 00:25:13.685
Come on!

438
00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.346
- Fuck.
- Come on!

439
00:25:15.381 --> 00:25:17.018
- Fuck.
- Come o-

440
00:25:17.053 --> 00:25:17.887
- Okay.

441
00:25:20.793 --> 00:25:22.958
Sorry.

442
00:25:24.324 --> 00:25:26.060
- Wasn't how you
envisioned it. huh?

443
00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:29.833
- Let's go.
- Okay.

444
00:27:31.187 --> 00:27:33.220
- It's so quiet.

445
00:27:33.255 --> 00:27:34.727
- Spooky quiet.

446
00:27:35.796 --> 00:27:37.191
- Have you guys
been here when it's empty?

447
00:27:37.226 --> 00:27:39.897
- Only once
with my mom. so.

448
00:27:39.932 --> 00:27:42.768
- Hey guys.
why are we whispering?

449
00:27:42.803 --> 00:27:44.000
- Sh!
- Dude!

450
00:27:44.035 --> 00:27:45.298
- I can't
hear you bro. what?

451
00:27:45.333 --> 00:27:46.904
- Oh. my god.
- Sh!

452
00:27:46.939 --> 00:27:47.773
- Sh!

453
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:51.007

00:27:51.042 --> 00:27:53.845
- Cock. fuck. big.

455
00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.044
- Sh!
- Shut the fuck up!

456
00:27:55.079 --> 00:27:56.474
- Sh!
- Don't sh me.

457
00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:01.050
- Fine. because no one's here.

458
00:28:02.086 --> 00:28:05.021
No one's here. are you?
- Dude!

459
00:28:05.056 --> 00:28:07.320
- Is anyone here?
♪ Here ♪

460
00:28:07.355 --> 00:28:10.026
- I don't think anyone is here.

461
00:28:10.061 --> 00:28:11.863
- We're all
alone. motherfuckers!

462
00:28:11.898 --> 00:28:14.162
- I think we run this bitch!

463
00:28:16.936 --> 00:28:19.035
- Yes!

464
00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:20.333
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

465
00:28:20.368 --> 00:28:22.269
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

466
00:28:22.304 --> 00:28:24.073
- Yeah!

467
00:28:24.108 --> 00:28:25.877
- Whoo!
- Ah!

468
00:28:25.912 --> 00:28:26.845
Ah. ah. ah.

469
00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:30.849
Ah.
- Get up!

470
00:28:30.884 --> 00:28:33.082
- And then that little
rat-faced sophomore

471
00:28:33.117 --> 00:28:35.084
had the nerve to tell me.

472
00:28:35.119 --> 00:28:37.350
the best actress that
they have in drama club.

473
00:28:37.385 --> 00:28:39.990
that I was stepping
on her lines.

474
00:28:40.025 --> 00:28:41.486
I mean. I'm the goddamn lead.

475
00:28:41.521 --> 00:28:45.292
I can step on your lines
if I want to. cunt.

476
00:28:45.327 --> 00:28:47.800
- Ugh. I'm totally
with you. baby.

477
00:28:48.594 --> 00:28:49.494
You're the star.

478
00:28:49.529 --> 00:28:53.036
- Such a good listener. Oop!

479
00:28:53.071 --> 00:28:55.566
- Does that mean we can have
sex tonight?

480
00:28:55.601 --> 00:28:57.205
- You know what we haven't done?

481
00:28:58.406 --> 00:28:59.570
- I can guess.

482
00:28:59.605 --> 00:29:00.439
- Can you?

483
00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:05.015
- Are we talking around
the parameters of an orgy?

484
00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:07.446
- Gross. Do not include me.

485
00:29:07.481 --> 00:29:10.515
- We have never taken
a shower together.

486
00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:50.258
- You need a refill?

487
00:29:50.293 --> 00:29:53.899
- I've still got
three-fourths of a cup.

488
00:29:53.934 --> 00:29:55.901
- I. I wasn't trying
to get you drunk

489
00:29:57.971 --> 00:30:01.302
- Is it bad if
I say I'm disappointed?

490
00:30:04.076 --> 00:30:06.241
- Dude. did I ever
tell you guys the time

491
00:30:06.276 --> 00:30:08.947
that I cut oceanography
and snuck in here

492
00:30:08.982 --> 00:30:11.884
to catch a glimpse of
fifth-period girls changing?

493
00:30:11.919 --> 00:30:14.953
There are so many hot girls

494
00:30:14.988 --> 00:30:18.484
in fifth period. right. right?

495
00:30:18.519 --> 00:30:22.158
Okay. so anyway. it was
like raining that day

496
00:30:22.193 --> 00:30:23.390
so no one got dressed.

497
00:30:23.425 --> 00:30:25.458
So I'm like hiding
in here waiting

498
00:30:25.493 --> 00:30:26.998
and no one shows up.

499
00:30:27.033 --> 00:30:29.396
But then when I try and leave.

500
00:30:29.431 --> 00:30:32.597
Ms. Bishop comes in to use
the PE coaches bathroom.

501
00:30:32.632 --> 00:30:35.468
And I'm like. "Okay.
what can I do now?

502
00:30:35.503 --> 00:30:38.240
Maybe I can catch a
glimpse of her vag. right?"

503
00:30:38.275 --> 00:30:39.978
But then. all I end up doing

504
00:30:40.013 --> 00:30:42.244
is smelling our
Spanish teacher's shit.

505
00:30:44.611 --> 00:30:46.215
Did I ever tell you
guys that story?

506
00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:50.021
What?

507
00:30:52.355 --> 00:30:55.191
Okay. Okay. I get it.

508
00:30:56.194 --> 00:30:57.688
You know what?

509
00:30:57.723 --> 00:30:59.261
It's not the size of the whale.

510
00:31:00.297 --> 00:31:02.165
it's the speed of the dolphin.

511
00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.299
- What?

512
00:31:04.334 --> 00:31:05.300
- You know
what I'm talking about?

513
00:31:05.335 --> 00:31:06.532
- No. I don't.
- You're crazy.

514
00:31:06.567 --> 00:31:07.698
- Yeah. you do.
- No. I don't.

515
00:31:07.733 --> 00:31:09.304
- Yeah. you do.
- Bye!

516
00:31:12.276 --> 00:31:13.440
You were saying?

517
00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:15.244
- Was I?

518
00:31:17.281 --> 00:31:18.247
- I don't even know.

519
00:31:18.282 --> 00:31:21.679
- Cheers.

520
00:31:21.714 --> 00:31:23.351
To dolphins.
- No.

521
00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:27.124
What?

522
00:31:27.159 --> 00:31:30.094
- Did you guys know that I
was Lady Macbeth in 8th grade?

523
00:31:32.131 --> 00:31:34.329
The school let us use this stage

524
00:31:34.364 --> 00:31:35.627
for our opening night.

525
00:31:37.268 --> 00:31:38.333
- Do you remember it?

526
00:31:39.633 --> 00:31:41.039
- That night?

527
00:31:41.074 --> 00:31:42.073
- No. her monologue.

528
00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:46.209
- Hmm. some of it.

529
00:31:46.244 --> 00:31:49.443
- Hmm. You should
perform it for us.

530
00:31:51.414 --> 00:31:53.183
- Here?
- Yeah.

531
00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:55.548
- No.

532

533
00:31:57.090 --> 00:31:58.518
- Please. I wanna see it.

534
00:31:58.553 --> 00:32:00.718
- No.

535
00:32:00.753 --> 00:32:02.995
- Come on. I wanna hear it.

536
00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:03.721

00:32:18.507 --> 00:32:22.245
- Come to my women's breasts

542
00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.511

543
00:32:24.546 --> 00:32:27.184
you murdering ministers.

544
00:32:27.219 --> 00:32:29.252
Wherever in your
sightless substances.

545
00:32:29.287 --> 00:32:31.452
you wait on nature's mischief.

546
00:32:32.121 --> 00:32:36.424
Come. thick night. and pall thee

547
00:32:36.459 --> 00:32:39.196

548
00:32:40.165 --> 00:32:44.498
that my keen knife see
not the wound it makes.

549
00:32:45.633 --> 00:32:49.503
nor heaven peep
through the blanket

550
00:32:49.538 --> 00:32:51.637
of the dark. to cry...

551
00:32:51.672 --> 00:32:54.475
Fuck you. Miguel!

552
00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:55.575
I thought I was good.

553
00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:00.151
And turn that light
off. you idiot.

554
00:33:01.286 --> 00:33:03.385
Miguel! You're an asshole.

555
00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:06.784
- Why am I an asshole?

556
00:33:10.328 --> 00:33:12.757
- So good. Really.
really impressive.

557
00:33:14.167 --> 00:33:15.265
Trevor. I wouldn't
run if I were you.

558
00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:16.431
I've already seen your faces.

559
00:33:16.466 --> 00:33:18.136
Plus. I know you guys.

560
00:33:18.171 --> 00:33:20.468
so. uh. I'm pretty
sure I could give

561
00:33:20.503 --> 00:33:22.239
a pretty detailed description

562
00:33:22.274 --> 00:33:24.406
of who you are to the police.

563
00:33:24.441 --> 00:33:27.409
Oh. sorry. Hold on.

564
00:33:29.743 --> 00:33:31.413
Okay.
- Fuck!

565
00:33:31.448 --> 00:33:32.744
Goddammit.
- God!

566
00:33:32.779 --> 00:33:34.647
- Turn around.

567
00:33:36.255 --> 00:33:38.321
Oh. that's a good one.

568
00:33:38.356 --> 00:33:41.324
Oh. that's good.

569
00:33:41.359 --> 00:33:42.820
See this. this.
school's not gonna think

570
00:33:42.855 --> 00:33:45.724
that I doctored these.

571
00:33:47.167 --> 00:33:48.199
All right.

572
00:33:51.765 --> 00:33:53.501
How are you guys
doing? You good?

573
00:33:55.472 --> 00:33:57.703
Okay. the only other question

574
00:33:57.738 --> 00:34:00.244
that I have for you is.

575
00:34:00.279 --> 00:34:03.247
do you have pellets for this?

576
00:34:08.485 --> 00:34:10.485
What?

577
00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:11.849
You guys don't want me to play?

578
00:34:13.391 --> 00:34:15.358
- Are you serious. Mr. Dunbar?
- I'm totally serious.

579
00:34:15.393 --> 00:34:16.491
This is gonna be fun.

580
00:34:17.890 --> 00:34:19.725
I'm not gonna turn you
guys in. I swear I'm not.

581
00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:22.728
That's not. that's not the
kind of person that I am.

582
00:34:22.763 --> 00:34:24.136
I won't.

583
00:34:24.171 --> 00:34:25.368
- What do you. what
do you wanna do?

584
00:34:25.403 --> 00:34:27.634
- I just wanna play.
That's all I wanna do.

585
00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:28.569
I just wanna play.

586
00:34:30.573 --> 00:34:32.276
Come on. what do you guys think.

587
00:34:32.311 --> 00:34:34.212
you were the only ones that
were bored out of your minds

588
00:34:34.247 --> 00:34:36.313
at home during this
fucking pandemic?

589
00:34:42.783 --> 00:34:44.585
Let's do this.

590
00:34:48.261 --> 00:34:49.722
Okay. so let's get
these all loaded up.

591
00:34:49.757 --> 00:34:51.196
We'll do two teams.

592
00:34:51.231 --> 00:34:54.364
We'll start at different
positions at the school.

593
00:34:54.399 --> 00:34:56.201
Trevor. these are all your guns?

594
00:34:56.236 --> 00:34:57.268
- Yeah.

595
00:34:58.502 --> 00:34:59.501
- How often do you play?

596
00:35:01.769 --> 00:35:05.210
- I have a
season pass to Paint World.

597
00:35:05.245 --> 00:35:08.246
- I'm sorry. you have a
season passed to what?

598
00:35:08.281 --> 00:35:11.414
- I have a season
pass to Paint World.

599
00:35:11.449 --> 00:35:13.416
- You have a season pass
to Paint World. Wow.

600
00:35:13.451 --> 00:35:15.220
And you lay in bed at night

601
00:35:15.255 --> 00:35:17.189
wondering why you're
struggling with girls.

602
00:35:17.224 --> 00:35:18.652
- Oh. shit.
- I'm kidding.

603
00:35:18.687 --> 00:35:20.324
I'm just busting your balls.

604
00:35:20.359 --> 00:35:21.952
But seriously. you're
gonna be a rock star

605
00:35:21.987 --> 00:35:23.459
'cause you're gonna have
two women on your team.

606
00:35:23.494 --> 00:35:24.922
Miguel. you're coming with me.

607
00:35:24.957 --> 00:35:26.495
- Wait. why am I on your team?

608
00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:28.497
- Because I'm
clearly the best shot

609
00:35:28.532 --> 00:35:30.400
and you are the weakest link.

610
00:35:30.435 --> 00:35:31.665
- Okay. who are you
calling a weak link?

611
00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:33.436
- No offense. man. No offense.

612
00:35:33.471 --> 00:35:35.537
I just. I play this all
the time. all right?

613
00:35:35.572 --> 00:35:36.901
- I have a. I have
a sixth sense.

614
00:35:36.936 --> 00:35:39.607
I can tell by
looking at somebody.

615
00:35:39.642 --> 00:35:40.905
whether they're good or not.

616
00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:43.875
and you don't look
like you could

617
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:45.217
hit a barn with a shotgun.

618
00:35:45.252 --> 00:35:47.417
Am I. am I right. Trevor?

619
00:35:47.452 --> 00:35:49.452
- We did play for my
birthday last year. yeah.

620
00:35:49.487 --> 00:35:50.618
What? You suck.

621
00:35:50.653 --> 00:35:51.553
- Shut up.

622
00:35:51.588 --> 00:35:52.851
- It's true.

623
00:35:52.886 --> 00:35:56.426
- Very good. Okay. so
here's the rules. okay?

624
00:35:56.461 --> 00:35:57.757
The rules of the game:

625
00:35:57.792 --> 00:36:01.332
no head shots. no chest
shots. arms and legs.

626
00:36:01.367 --> 00:36:03.532
If you get hit in
the leg. you limp.

627
00:36:03.567 --> 00:36:05.930
If you run full out.
you're disqualified.

628
00:36:05.965 --> 00:36:07.668
you're cheating. okay?

629
00:36:07.703 --> 00:36:09.439
Three shots total and your out.

630
00:36:09.474 --> 00:36:11.507
- Ah. this is gonna be so dope.

631
00:36:11.542 --> 00:36:12.937
- This is gonna be so dope.

632
00:36:12.972 --> 00:36:15.610
One more thing
though. don't hate me.

633
00:36:16.613 --> 00:36:18.008
All right. guys.

634
00:36:18.043 --> 00:36:19.581
Phones in. Let's do it.

635
00:36:19.616 --> 00:36:21.286
All right? Come on.

636
00:36:21.321 --> 00:36:22.012
- What?

637
00:36:22.047 --> 00:36:23.651
- We have to do it. Come on.

638
00:36:23.686 --> 00:36:24.949
It's. I don't want people
signaling each other

639
00:36:24.984 --> 00:36:26.324
while we're playing.

640
00:36:26.359 --> 00:36:27.853
- No. I'm not
giving you my phone.

641
00:36:27.888 --> 00:36:29.459
- Can we promise not to?

642
00:36:29.494 --> 00:36:31.659
- Yeah. we'll like
give you our word.

643
00:36:31.694 --> 00:36:32.693
- Your word. really?

644
00:36:32.728 --> 00:36:34.266
I. you know that
I've been teaching

645
00:36:34.301 --> 00:36:35.663
for almost two decades.

646
00:36:35.698 --> 00:36:37.797
A 17 year old's word
means about as much

647
00:36:37.832 --> 00:36:40.569
as the principal's word.
which is not at all.

648
00:36:40.604 --> 00:36:42.736
So put your phones
in the locker.

649
00:36:42.771 --> 00:36:44.672
- I mean. he's right.

650
00:36:44.707 --> 00:36:46.344
I mean. I've played with guys

651
00:36:46.379 --> 00:36:48.313
who've signaled their
team members all the time.

652
00:36:48.348 --> 00:36:49.611
It's kind of hard not to

653
00:36:49.646 --> 00:36:51.316
when you're pinned
down and desperate.

654
00:36:51.351 --> 00:36:53.615
'Cause he has a point.

655
00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:56.783
- Expert analysis.
Thank you very much.

656
00:36:56.818 --> 00:36:58.917
Extra points this
semester. for sure.

657
00:36:58.952 --> 00:37:00.688
- For real?

658
00:37:00.723 --> 00:37:03.295
- Guys. come on. I'm
really. I'm a nice guy.

659
00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:05.022
I'm cool. and this is like.

660
00:37:05.057 --> 00:37:06.793
this is a time machine for me

661
00:37:06.828 --> 00:37:08.531
with you guys right
now doing this.

662
00:37:08.566 --> 00:37:09.466
This is amazing.

663
00:37:09.501 --> 00:37:11.633
Don't think that I'm so old

664
00:37:11.668 --> 00:37:13.668
that I don't remember
what it was like

665
00:37:13.703 --> 00:37:15.769
to be your age. because I do.

666
00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:18.937
Come on. level playing
field. Let's do this.

667
00:37:18.972 --> 00:37:21.643
I. I'm in as well.

668
00:37:21.678 --> 00:37:22.941
Come on. give me your phones.

669
00:37:25.748 --> 00:37:26.582
Thank you.

670
00:37:32.524 --> 00:37:33.721
Give me your phone. Come on.

671
00:37:35.791 --> 00:37:36.724
Genesis. come on.

672
00:37:44.899 --> 00:37:45.733
Thank you.

673
00:37:53.578 --> 00:37:56.447
The game demands a strong
willingness for teamwork.

674
00:37:57.747 --> 00:38:00.418
The game demands
strategic thinking.

675
00:38:01.454 --> 00:38:03.751
The game. ladies and gentlemen.

676
00:38:03.786 --> 00:38:04.719
is capture the flag.

677
00:38:05.788 --> 00:38:07.557
located in the perfect midpoint.

678
00:38:09.396 --> 00:38:10.758
We start on opposite
ends of the school.

679
00:38:10.793 --> 00:38:12.364
Sadie. Trevor. and Genesis.

680
00:38:12.399 --> 00:38:14.465
you take up position
at the south entrance.

681
00:38:15.633 --> 00:38:16.995
Miguel and myself will start

682
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:19.701
on the edge of the east
wing. Hey. you do me a favor.

683
00:38:19.736 --> 00:38:21.868
when you see that
clock hit- 00.

684
00:38:21.903 --> 00:38:23.408
it's go time. all right?

685
00:38:23.443 --> 00:38:25.641
That's the green light.

686
00:38:25.676 --> 00:38:27.676
- Well. what do we do then?

687
00:38:27.711 --> 00:38:28.908
- Just follow me.

688
00:38:30.043 --> 00:38:31.581
Watch the firework. Here.

689
00:38:34.652 --> 00:38:35.684
- You're out.

690
00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:57.574
- So look. we're three.
we have the advantage.

691
00:38:57.609 --> 00:38:59.103
I'll run point.

692
00:38:59.138 --> 00:39:01.776
I'll signal you guys forward.
you sweep the perimeter.

693
00:39:01.811 --> 00:39:03.041
- English. nerd.

694
00:39:04.209 --> 00:39:06.781
- Look around and make
sure no one is there

695
00:39:06.816 --> 00:39:08.717
and wave me forward.

696
00:39:08.752 --> 00:39:10.521
We'll stop at the
locker on the way.

697
00:39:10.556 --> 00:39:12.820
Um it's not the best cover.

698
00:39:12.855 --> 00:39:15.526
but it's better
than nothing. so.

699
00:39:15.561 --> 00:39:17.121
- You are way too into this.

700
00:39:17.156 --> 00:39:18.991
- Have you ever been
shot by a pellet?

701
00:39:19.026 --> 00:39:22.731
- I have. It doesn't feel
like a water balloon.

702
00:39:22.766 --> 00:39:26.163
- Water balloons hurt.

703
00:39:26.198 --> 00:39:27.934
- Here we go. Come on.

704
00:39:27.969 --> 00:39:29.034
- Come on.

705
00:39:29.069 --> 00:39:30.904
- That's it.

706
00:39:39.816 --> 00:39:42.784
The flag's right there
inside the office.

707
00:39:42.819 --> 00:39:44.049
Wait here.

708
00:40:09.846 --> 00:40:10.845
- Sh.

709
00:40:14.752 --> 00:40:15.784
- What are we waiting for?

710
00:40:15.819 --> 00:40:16.752
- Wait!
- What?

711
00:40:16.787 --> 00:40:17.786
- Is he there?

712
00:40:17.821 --> 00:40:18.820
- He's right by
the soda machine.

713
00:40:18.855 --> 00:40:20.723
- So he beat us.

714
00:40:20.758 --> 00:40:22.824
- Only one way to find out.

715
00:40:22.859 --> 00:40:24.826
When he takes me out.
there'll be a moment

716
00:40:24.861 --> 00:40:26.256
where he's focused only on me.

717
00:40:26.291 --> 00:40:27.928
I'll obscure a path.

718
00:40:27.963 --> 00:40:29.127
- That doesn't make sense.

719
00:40:29.162 --> 00:40:30.832
- It does. He's
sacrificing himself.

720
00:40:32.231 --> 00:40:34.198
- Are you sure that'll work?
- Not at all.

721
00:40:34.233 --> 00:40:36.167
Look. chances are
one or both of you

722
00:40:36.202 --> 00:40:38.543
will be able to run with me.

723
00:40:38.578 --> 00:40:40.743
It's the only strategy we have.

724
00:40:40.778 --> 00:40:41.711
- Okay. but-

725
00:40:41.746 --> 00:40:42.613
- Look. on three.

726
00:40:43.616 --> 00:40:44.945
One. two. three.

727
00:40:47.653 --> 00:40:48.784
- Wait!

728
00:40:52.185 --> 00:40:53.756
- Oh. snap!

729
00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:56.726
- Fuck!

730
00:40:57.597 --> 00:40:58.893
- Ah! Motherfucker!

731
00:41:09.708 --> 00:41:11.576
- Hi!

732
00:41:18.618 --> 00:41:22.950
- Okay. well. it looks like
I chose the wrong teammate.

733
00:41:23.686 --> 00:41:25.150
Did you see me in the
mirror over there?

734
00:41:25.185 --> 00:41:26.822
Yeah?
- Yeah.

735
00:41:26.857 --> 00:41:29.220
- Tactical skills on point.

736
00:41:29.255 --> 00:41:30.727
Should bode well
for your future.

737
00:41:30.762 --> 00:41:33.565
You guys ready to
go for round two?

738
00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:34.291
Shouldn't we take a second

739
00:41:34.326 --> 00:41:36.062
to like clean off and regroup?

740
00:41:36.097 --> 00:41:37.932
- No. no.

741
00:41:37.967 --> 00:41:38.999
We. we don't wanna be here

742
00:41:39.034 --> 00:41:40.803
for more than one or two hours

743
00:41:40.838 --> 00:41:43.905
because that security guard
might loop back around again.

744
00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:44.840
You know what though?

745
00:41:44.875 --> 00:41:46.710
I do wanna change up the teams.

746
00:41:46.745 --> 00:41:49.581
Sadie. do you
wanna come with me?

747
00:41:55.886 --> 00:41:58.183
What. did I say
something that was funny?

748
00:42:00.088 --> 00:42:04.596
- No. not at all.
Mr. Dunbar.

749
00:42:04.631 --> 00:42:06.059
- Why do you want
her on your team?

750
00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:10.701
- Well. Trevor two things.

751
00:42:10.736 --> 00:42:14.903
first. she's really great
at taking direction.

752
00:42:14.938 --> 00:42:18.610
And as you were all
painfully aware of

753
00:42:18.645 --> 00:42:19.369
in this last round.

754
00:42:19.404 --> 00:42:21.206
my current teammate is not.

755
00:42:22.374 --> 00:42:23.846
- And the second?

756
00:42:23.881 --> 00:42:27.047
- And the second is. and
you guys should know this.

757
00:42:28.314 --> 00:42:33.086
I have a massive.
massive crush on her.

758
00:42:40.128 --> 00:42:43.327
What? What. did I say something?

759
00:42:43.362 --> 00:42:46.066
- Mr. Dunbar.
that's really weird.

760
00:42:46.101 --> 00:42:49.971
- Why is that really
weird. Genesis?

761
00:42:51.436 --> 00:42:52.908
But I'm just parroting a rumor

762
00:42:52.943 --> 00:42:55.647
that I heard from some
students at school.

763
00:42:58.751 --> 00:43:00.784
- What are you talking about?

764
00:43:00.819 --> 00:43:04.051
- I was in your Zoom meeting.

765
00:43:04.086 --> 00:43:05.888
I heard everything
you guys said.

766
00:43:05.923 --> 00:43:07.087
I. I heard you guys even talking

767
00:43:07.122 --> 00:43:08.792
about coming here tonight.

768
00:43:08.827 --> 00:43:11.729
which is why I am here
just to have a little fun.

769
00:43:11.764 --> 00:43:13.258
- That stuff we said.
I mean. we didn't-

770
00:43:13.293 --> 00:43:15.062
- Yeah. we were kidding.

771
00:43:15.097 --> 00:43:16.899
- No. the thing. I don't think.

772
00:43:19.937 --> 00:43:22.234
I don't think that
those were jokes.

773
00:43:22.269 --> 00:43:24.742
Genesis. I think if. uh.

774
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:28.405
if the mood struck you.

775
00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.044
that you'd. you'd turn me in.

776
00:43:33.115 --> 00:43:34.114
I do.

777
00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:37.755
I think that you guys would
have lied collectively

778
00:43:38.384 --> 00:43:40.318
and ruined my career.

779
00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:45.862
And that sucks.

780
00:43:45.897 --> 00:43:47.193
Doesn't it? Doesn't that suck?

781
00:43:48.801 --> 00:43:49.800
And why?

782
00:43:49.836 --> 00:43:53.100
All because I showed a
little favoritism to Sadie.

783
00:43:53.135 --> 00:43:55.971
or. I'm sorry. should
I say @LittleSadie888?

784
00:44:01.209 --> 00:44:03.077
- Mr. Dunbar. you've
got it all wrong.

785
00:44:03.112 --> 00:44:04.144
We would never do anything

786
00:44:04.179 --> 00:44:04.947
like that.
- I don't think that I do

787
00:44:04.982 --> 00:44:06.212
have it all wrong.

788
00:44:06.247 --> 00:44:07.477
I think that you have
it all wrong. Miguel.

789
00:44:07.512 --> 00:44:08.984
I think that you have
it all wrong about me.

790
00:44:25.772 --> 00:44:27.398
Your faces. You
guys are ridiculous.

791
00:44:27.433 --> 00:44:29.774
I'm kidding. I'm joking.

792
00:44:29.809 --> 00:44:32.777
I'm not mad. I'm not mad.

793
00:44:38.444 --> 00:44:40.411
Your faces.

794
00:44:43.922 --> 00:44:47.759
I do. however. wanna fly
solo on this next round

795
00:44:47.794 --> 00:44:48.793
if that's okay.

796
00:44:48.828 --> 00:44:51.026
Is that okay with you guys?

797
00:44:51.061 --> 00:44:53.160
Should we. say. what.

798
00:44:53.896 --> 00:44:58.935
when the little hand
hits the five. game one?

799
00:44:58.970 --> 00:44:59.837
That sounds good?

800
00:45:00.499 --> 00:45:02.268
Yeah? All right.

801
00:45:09.882 --> 00:45:10.914
- What the fuck was that?

802
00:45:10.949 --> 00:45:12.982
- Miguel. you're shaking.

803
00:45:13.886 --> 00:45:15.083
- Fuck.

804
00:45:15.118 --> 00:45:15.884
- You guys. I think we
should get out of here.

805
00:45:15.919 --> 00:45:17.019
- Yeah.
you think? Let's go.

806
00:45:17.054 --> 00:45:18.449
- Wait. what about our phones?

807
00:45:19.859 --> 00:45:20.891
- Shit. shit.
- I don't care about my phone.

808
00:45:20.926 --> 00:45:21.991
Okay? Let's just
get out of here.

809
00:45:22.026 --> 00:45:22.825
- Are you fucking high?

810
00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:25.093
I'm not leaving here
without my phone.

811
00:45:25.128 --> 00:45:26.424
I'm serious.

812
00:45:28.098 --> 00:45:30.263
- Fine. You guys
go on without us.

813
00:45:30.298 --> 00:45:31.495
We'll get your phones

814
00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:32.837
and we'll meet you at
the front entrance.

815
00:45:32.872 --> 00:45:34.036
- Come on.
- Yeah. whatever.

816
00:45:34.071 --> 00:45:35.235
Yeah. let's go.
I'll see you there.

817
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:37.072
- Jesus Christ.
- Fuck.

818
00:45:37.943 --> 00:45:39.140
Why do we need our phones?

819
00:45:39.175 --> 00:45:41.274
- Because. It'll be okay.

820
00:45:41.309 --> 00:45:43.408
- So what
was all that about?

821
00:45:43.443 --> 00:45:44.948
- What?

822
00:45:44.983 --> 00:45:47.082
- He knew your Instagram handle.

823
00:45:47.117 --> 00:45:47.951
- So what?

824
00:45:49.251 --> 00:45:51.515
- I mean your own private-
- What. Trevor?

825
00:45:54.289 --> 00:45:56.960
- Did you give him your
number or something?

826
00:45:56.995 --> 00:45:58.258
- Did I give him
my phone number?

827
00:45:58.293 --> 00:45:59.556
- I'm asking.

828
00:45:59.591 --> 00:46:02.064
- No. he follows
me on Instagram.

829
00:46:02.099 --> 00:46:03.560
It's not a big deal.

830
00:46:03.595 --> 00:46:05.562
- But your page is private.

831
00:46:05.597 --> 00:46:08.136
which means you had to give
him access to your page.

832
00:46:08.171 --> 00:46:09.467
We have all of our pictures

833
00:46:09.502 --> 00:46:11.535
on your page.
- Yes. detective. So what?

834
00:46:12.204 --> 00:46:14.010
- Did he ever DM you?

835
00:46:15.046 --> 00:46:16.045
- I don't know.

836
00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:17.178
- No. fuck that. You'd remember.

837
00:46:17.213 --> 00:46:18.883
- I DM a lot of people.

838
00:46:20.546 --> 00:46:21.919
- Okay.

839
00:46:21.954 --> 00:46:24.119
- I'm not talking about this.

840
00:46:24.154 --> 00:46:25.252
I just wanna go home.

841
00:46:28.158 --> 00:46:29.256
- Fuck this.

842
00:46:38.905 --> 00:46:41.202
- I think
somebody double-locked it

843
00:46:41.237 --> 00:46:42.368
so no one can come
in or come out.

844
00:46:42.403 --> 00:46:43.941
Let's just go out
the way we came.

845
00:46:43.976 --> 00:46:45.338
- Yeah. but. hold on.

846
00:46:45.373 --> 00:46:47.241
Listen.

847
00:46:48.409 --> 00:46:50.145
- What? Metal?

848
00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:51.113
- Chains.

849
00:46:52.314 --> 00:46:53.214
It's giving me a
little bit of slack.

850
00:46:53.249 --> 00:46:55.249
I. I think they were locked

851
00:46:55.284 --> 00:46:57.251
by chains from the outside.

852
00:46:58.287 --> 00:47:02.025
- They probably are. What?

853
00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:03.224
- Trevor. when we came in.

854
00:47:03.259 --> 00:47:04.258
there weren't chains
on the outside.

855
00:47:04.293 --> 00:47:05.292
- You were looking?

856
00:47:05.327 --> 00:47:06.227
- No. but-
- So how would you know?

857
00:47:06.262 --> 00:47:07.525
- Then why won't it open?

858
00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:10.165
- I don't know. let's just
go back the way we came.

859
00:47:12.301 --> 00:47:13.267
Come on!

860
00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:16.237
- Why don't you just
break a window then. tough guy?

861
00:47:16.272 --> 00:47:17.436
- There's no point.

862
00:47:17.471 --> 00:47:19.306
There's barbed wire
on the windows.

863
00:47:23.015 --> 00:47:26.148
- Stop. Jesus. Gen. stop!

864
00:47:26.183 --> 00:47:27.545
- I need my phone!

865
00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:31.219
I'm not leaving
without it.

866
00:47:31.254 --> 00:47:32.187
- Fuck.

867
00:47:38.393 --> 00:47:41.064
- Fucking-
- Trevor!

868
00:47:41.099 --> 00:47:42.197
- Trevor!

869
00:47:42.232 --> 00:47:43.297
- What?

870
00:47:43.332 --> 00:47:45.662
- Something is wrong.

871
00:47:45.697 --> 00:47:47.664
Something is fucking wrong.

872
00:48:04.353 --> 00:48:05.583
- Here. move.

873
00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:13.998
- Keep going.

874
00:48:14.033 --> 00:48:14.658
- Yeah. I am.

875
00:48:15.727 --> 00:48:18.464
I almost got it.

876
00:48:24.175 --> 00:48:25.306
Mr. Dunbar?

877
00:48:27.310 --> 00:48:29.178
- You know. that's
a pretty serious offense.

878
00:48:29.213 --> 00:48:30.641
destroying school property.

879
00:48:30.676 --> 00:48:33.611
- Let's get out of here.

880
00:48:33.646 --> 00:48:35.283
- I'm not leaving.

881
00:48:35.318 --> 00:48:36.317
- Gen!

882
00:48:36.352 --> 00:48:38.121
Fuck!

883
00:48:38.156 --> 00:48:39.353
- What the fuck. man?

884
00:48:39.388 --> 00:48:40.288
- Dude. we're not
playing anymore.

885
00:48:44.096 --> 00:48:46.426
- What the hell. man? Stop!

886
00:48:48.331 --> 00:48:50.001
Gen. let's go.
- My phone!

887
00:48:50.036 --> 00:48:51.497
- Forget your phone.

888
00:48:51.532 --> 00:48:53.301
- You guys. we
need to get out of here.

889
00:48:53.336 --> 00:48:54.533
- Yeah. I'm over this shit.

890
00:48:54.568 --> 00:48:56.106
- No. he locked all the doors.

891
00:48:56.141 --> 00:48:58.339
- What?

892
00:48:58.374 --> 00:49:00.209
Dude. I'm not fucking
around anymore.

893
00:49:00.244 --> 00:49:01.243
We're done playing.

894
00:49:02.246 --> 00:49:04.081
- Really? You're
done playing paintball?

895
00:49:04.116 --> 00:49:05.313
- Look. someone's
gonna get hurt.

896
00:49:05.348 --> 00:49:06.314
And if you don't stop
shooting that thing.

897
00:49:06.349 --> 00:49:07.414
it might be you.

898
00:49:14.456 --> 00:49:16.995
Good. The game's over.

899
00:49:18.097 --> 00:49:19.360
- I'd be
lying if I didn't say

900
00:49:19.395 --> 00:49:21.131
I wasn't a little disappointed.

901
00:49:21.166 --> 00:49:24.563
You know. Washington. he
may have been a bitch.

902
00:49:24.598 --> 00:49:27.137
but I don't think
he ever surrendered.

903
00:49:27.172 --> 00:49:28.072
- Hey. we gotta go.

904
00:49:28.107 --> 00:49:29.403
- We have to get past him

905
00:49:29.438 --> 00:49:31.042
to get to the west entrance.

906
00:49:33.376 --> 00:49:34.771
- Yo. we're leaving. man.

907
00:49:37.842 --> 00:49:39.743
- It's a free country.

908
00:49:39.778 --> 00:49:42.317
- Why don't you just come out?

909
00:49:42.352 --> 00:49:44.088
- I just gave up my
Second Amendment right.

910
00:49:44.123 --> 00:49:45.155
That's not enough?

911
00:49:51.130 --> 00:49:52.360
- It's okay.
- What?

912
00:49:52.395 --> 00:49:54.098
We have to walk right past him.

913
00:49:54.133 --> 00:49:55.330
- He threw his gun out.

914
00:49:55.365 --> 00:49:56.727
- Well. what if he
has another one?

915
00:49:56.762 --> 00:49:58.366
- I'm not staying here.

916
00:49:59.633 --> 00:50:00.467
- Okay.

917
00:50:05.309 --> 00:50:06.143
- Fuck.

918
00:50:10.248 --> 00:50:11.709
It's fine. he bailed.

919
00:50:11.744 --> 00:50:14.382
- Ah! Oh!
- Hey. what the fuck. man?

920
00:50:14.417 --> 00:50:15.449
We said we were done!

921
00:50:15.484 --> 00:50:17.088
- Ah! Oh!
- Trevor.

922
00:50:17.123 --> 00:50:18.353
this is not paint. oh my gosh.

923
00:50:18.388 --> 00:50:20.454
- Trevor!
- Oh shit. it's blood!

924
00:50:20.489 --> 00:50:22.357
- What?

925
00:50:22.392 --> 00:50:24.425
- What the fuck?
- Shit. dude!

926
00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:25.327
- Fuck!
- Get up!

927
00:50:25.362 --> 00:50:26.526
- Get up!
- Come on!

928
00:50:28.464 --> 00:50:32.301
- Oh fuck. bro!

929
00:50:32.336 --> 00:50:34.204
- Come on. go! You've got it!

930
00:50:35.438 --> 00:50:37.372
Keep going. keep going! Get up!

931
00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:40.408
Get up!

932
00:50:42.511 --> 00:50:43.609
Go!
- Come on!

933
00:50:45.448 --> 00:50:47.481
- Get up!
- Come on!

934
00:50:47.516 --> 00:50:49.483
- Get up!
- Get in the fucking door!

935
00:50:49.518 --> 00:50:50.682
- Get up!

936
00:50:53.324 --> 00:50:55.555
Come on. put him here.

937
00:50:55.590 --> 00:50:56.886
Put him here. come on.

938
00:50:59.231 --> 00:51:00.593
- Stay there.
stay there. stay there!

939
00:51:00.628 --> 00:51:01.792
- He's bleeding bad.

940
00:51:01.827 --> 00:51:04.168
- Don't say that!
- Say what?

941
00:51:04.203 --> 00:51:05.400
- You're talking about
me like I'm not here

942
00:51:05.435 --> 00:51:07.204
and it feels like I'm
gonna fucking die!

943
00:51:07.239 --> 00:51:08.700
- You're not gonna die!

944
00:51:08.735 --> 00:51:10.339
- Look. nobody's gonna
die. man. all right?

945
00:51:10.374 --> 00:51:13.672
- Genesis fucking
bailed on us! Ah. fuck.

946
00:51:13.707 --> 00:51:14.838
- All right. help me with this.

947
00:51:14.873 --> 00:51:17.643
Come on.

948
00:51:17.678 --> 00:51:18.710
I'll get it. I got it.

949
00:51:18.745 --> 00:51:20.646
I got it. I got it.

950
00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:23.913
- This way.
- Fuck. fuck. fuck.

951
00:51:23.948 --> 00:51:25.387
Okay. come on. come on.

952
00:51:25.422 --> 00:51:26.520
Get up. get up.

953
00:51:26.555 --> 00:51:28.291
Get your ass up! Come on!

954
00:51:28.326 --> 00:51:30.590
- Oh. fuck.
- Hold on. hold on.

955
00:51:46.311 --> 00:51:48.278
- Guys. get in here!

956
00:51:48.313 --> 00:51:49.477
Help me get this window open.

957
00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:53.580
- Fuck. fuck. fuck!

958
00:51:53.615 --> 00:51:55.252
Oh. I'm sorry!

959
00:51:55.287 --> 00:51:56.517
Come on. get up. man.

960
00:51:56.552 --> 00:51:58.519
- I can't. I don't
wanna die. man!

961
00:51:58.554 --> 00:52:00.290
- It's okay. Stop!

962
00:52:00.325 --> 00:52:01.390
You're not gonna die.

963
00:52:01.425 --> 00:52:02.589
- This only opens a little bit.

964
00:52:02.624 --> 00:52:03.920
We can't fit through here.

965
00:52:08.927 --> 00:52:10.729
- You know what
really upsets me?

966
00:52:12.733 --> 00:52:15.800
That we never got to
Theodore Roosevelt in class.

967
00:52:15.835 --> 00:52:18.737
who is by far. in my opinion.

968
00:52:19.575 --> 00:52:20.706
our greatest president.

969
00:52:22.512 --> 00:52:27.515
And I quote. "The
fool. who has not sense

970
00:52:28.518 --> 00:52:30.782
to discriminate between
what is good and what is bad

971
00:52:32.456 --> 00:52:35.886
is well-nigh as
dangerous as the man

972
00:52:37.659 --> 00:52:38.922
who does discriminate

973
00:53:00.044 --> 00:53:01.450
- Daddy!

974
00:53:09.526 --> 00:53:11.922
and yet chooses the bad.

975
00:53:19.536 --> 00:53:22.603
- Hey! There's
someone out there.

976
00:53:22.638 --> 00:53:24.803
- What?
- Hey! Help us!

977
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:31.282
- No. on the podcast
that we will never do

978
00:53:31.684 --> 00:53:34.879
but we should do

979
00:53:34.914 --> 00:53:36.914
if we had any balls at all.

980
00:53:36.949 --> 00:53:38.949
- Hey. help us!

981
00:53:38.984 --> 00:53:40.555
- Help us!

982
00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:42.524
- I their I'm lightheaded.

983
00:53:42.559 --> 00:53:44.053
- And we don't judge.

984
00:53:44.088 --> 00:53:47.331
'cause we wanna see this
thing through. right?

985
00:53:47.366 --> 00:53:49.729
So we're laying on the couch.

986
00:53:49.764 --> 00:53:53.931
we got the wine. and this mutt

987
00:53:53.966 --> 00:53:57.033
won't leave me alone all night.

988
00:53:57.068 --> 00:54:00.773
- Fuck! God.
- Come on.

989
00:54:00.808 --> 00:54:03.677
- So I kick it a
little. you know?

990
00:54:03.712 --> 00:54:04.843
Okay. I don't
wanna hurt the dog.

991
00:54:04.878 --> 00:54:06.317
I kick it just a little bit.

992
00:54:06.352 --> 00:54:08.044
just to say. you
know. "Let's not."

993
00:54:08.079 --> 00:54:10.354
She's a little.
unhurt. unneutered dog.

994
00:54:10.389 --> 00:54:12.015
gonna have sex with my dime.

995
00:54:16.791 --> 00:54:18.725
- I mean. what the...

Can we? Hold on a minute.

We have to go now.

1013
00:55:08.777 --> 00:55:10.007
- We're not leaving him here?

1014
00:55:10.042 --> 00:55:10.942

- I was hiding.

1022
00:56:10.102 --> 00:56:11.838
I saw him go outside
and I couldn't get

1023
00:56:11.873 --> 00:56:13.136
through any of the doors.

1024
00:56:15.679 --> 00:56:16.711
Where's Miguel?

1025
00:56:18.209 --> 00:56:20.748
- He's fucking dead.

1026
00:56:20.783 --> 00:56:22.046

00:56:26.921 --> 00:56:31.792
We have to get outta here.

00:56:55.686 --> 00:56:57.081

- We have to get another way.

1034
00:57:03.122 --> 00:57:04.759
This side of campus
is all locked.

1035
00:57:04.794 --> 00:57:06.222
- Mr. Dunbar has
been here forever.

1036
00:57:06.257 --> 00:57:09.027
He's gotta know all the hallway
passages and everything.

1037
00:57:09.062 --> 00:57:10.897
And with her hobbling.
we'll never be fast enough.

1038
00:57:10.932 --> 00:57:12.228
- Don't even think about
fucking leaving me.

1039
00:57:12.263 --> 00:57:14.032
- No. someone
has to bait him.

1040
00:57:14.067 --> 00:57:16.705
- No. I think. I
think we all go.

1041
00:57:17.741 --> 00:57:19.169
I could run.
- No. no. no. no. no.

1042
00:57:19.204 --> 00:57:20.643
Stop helping her.
- Trevor!

1043

- Look. I'll lure
him that way. okay?

1044
00:57:23.109 --> 00:57:24.515

1047
00:57:28.081 --> 00:57:28.915

Your friends left you. huh?

1052
00:57:52.842 --> 00:57:54.545
That is fucked up.

Fuck you. Mr. Dunbar.

1059
00:58:19.132 --> 00:58:20.637
If there's one thing

1060
00:58:22.234 --> 00:58:24.773
that you learned from
my class this semester

1061
00:58:24.808 --> 00:58:27.875
as a baseline are
fucking manners.

1062
00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:28.909
You know that?

1063
00:58:54.739 --> 00:58:56.200
- Ow!
- Come here.

1064
00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:02.877
- What are we waiting for?

1065
00:59:02.912 --> 00:59:03.713
- I don't know which way to go.

1066
00:59:03.748 --> 00:59:04.945
- I'm not picky.

1067
00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:06.881
- Why can't you think of away?

1068
00:59:06.916 --> 00:59:09.884
- Well. for one. I think
I have a concussion. okay?

1069
00:59:09.919 --> 00:59:12.623
Don't pressure me. I don't
do well under pressure.

1070
00:59:15.056 --> 00:59:16.660
- Well. I could go-

1071
00:59:17.388 --> 00:59:20.862
- Wait. last semester.

1072
00:59:20.897 --> 00:59:22.292
drama club after school.

1073
00:59:22.327 --> 00:59:23.832
I would go and smoke-

1074
00:59:23.867 --> 00:59:25.394
- Gen. who fucking cares?
- No. no. no.

1075
00:59:25.429 --> 00:59:26.901
The backstage stairwell.

1076
00:59:26.936 --> 00:59:29.640
it's the auditorium roof.

1077
00:59:29.675 --> 00:59:30.366
It's never locked.

1078
00:59:33.074 --> 00:59:33.908
- Are you sure?

1079
00:59:35.307 --> 00:59:37.307
- Now. no. It was last winter.

1080
00:59:37.342 --> 00:59:39.947
But it could still be unlocked.

1081
00:59:40.785 --> 00:59:42.719
You have a better idea?

1082
00:59:43.414 --> 00:59:44.754
- Come on.

1083
00:59:59.738 --> 01:00:01.331
- Is there anybody in here?

1084
01:00:06.008 --> 01:00:08.910
Because if there is. I
am definitely gonna need

1085
01:00:08.945 --> 01:00:11.143
to see a bathroom pass
at the end of this.

1086
01:00:16.216 --> 01:00:20.020
You know what bothers me
more than anything has

1087
01:00:20.055 --> 01:00:23.353
for the past few decades
that I've been a teacher?

1088
01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:27.731
Kids saying that they have
to go to the bathroom.

1089
01:00:28.998 --> 01:00:30.701
you get them a bathroom pass.

1090
01:00:31.968 --> 01:00:33.429
but they don't
really have to go.

1091
01:00:43.881 --> 01:00:45.045
They're just bored.

1092
01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:48.180
I mean. I understand
that. Hell. I get bored.

1093
01:00:50.756 --> 01:00:53.988
That doesn't seem like
a boredom issue for me.

1094
01:00:54.023 --> 01:00:56.485
that just seems like a
general respect issue.

1095
01:01:05.804 --> 01:01:08.772
I'm a slave to the
bell also. you know?

1096
01:01:08.807 --> 01:01:12.237
I can't leave. I can't go.

1097
01:01:12.272 --> 01:01:13.436
I gotta stay.

1098
01:01:13.471 --> 01:01:17.847
It's ridiculous. It's archaic.

1099
01:01:17.882 --> 01:01:21.213
What other job forces
you to clinch a shit

1100
01:01:21.248 --> 01:01:24.051
for 55-plus minutes.

1101
01:01:26.451 --> 01:01:31.454
just staring at the
clock and praying?

1102
01:02:09.329 --> 01:02:11.164
- Let's wait. Stop.

1103
01:02:11.199 --> 01:02:13.100
- Come on we're almost there.
- Let's wait. Stop.

1104
01:02:13.135 --> 01:02:17.038
- You go and see if it's
open and then come back.

1105
01:02:17.073 --> 01:02:19.172
- Stay here.
Don't go anywhere.

1106
01:02:19.207 --> 01:02:20.239
- Really?

1107
01:02:43.528 --> 01:02:45.968
- Maintenance
locked all the doors.

1108
01:02:48.566 --> 01:02:50.907
Gen?

1109
01:02:53.208 --> 01:02:54.504
Please. you're scaring me.

1110
01:02:57.179 --> 01:02:59.883
- Are you okay?
- He's here. He's here.

1111
01:02:59.918 --> 01:03:01.148
- Where's Gen?
- I don't know.

1112
01:03:11.193 --> 01:03:12.489
- Crazy story.

1113
01:03:12.524 --> 01:03:14.491
I never told
anybody this before.

1114
01:03:14.526 --> 01:03:17.934
I got a call from Principal
Kabasis a few years back

1115
01:03:17.969 --> 01:03:19.936
asking me how I would feel

1116
01:03:21.038 --> 01:03:23.170
about teaching a theater class.

1117
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:26.404
The regular teacher. I
guess she got some sort

1118
01:03:26.439 --> 01:03:30.111
of like mononucleosis
illness kind of thing.

1119
01:03:30.146 --> 01:03:31.541
She retired early

1120
01:03:31.576 --> 01:03:33.147
and took her syllabus with her.

1121
01:03:34.249 --> 01:03:36.150
- Where is he?
- I don't know!

1122
01:03:36.185 --> 01:03:37.580
I don't know.

1123
01:03:37.615 --> 01:03:41.254
- I was. I was nervous.

1124
01:03:41.289 --> 01:03:43.993
I was reluctant. But
then. you know what?

1125
01:03:44.028 --> 01:03:45.159
At some point I thought.

1126
01:03:46.624 --> 01:03:47.491
"What the hell.

1127
01:03:48.659 --> 01:03:51.099
I'm gonna step outside
of my comfort zone.

1128
01:03:51.134 --> 01:03:52.562
I'm gonna dive in."

1129
01:03:52.597 --> 01:03:54.630
I even wrote a
little one-act called

1130
01:03:54.665 --> 01:03:56.973
"The Death of Lincoln."

1131
01:03:58.141 --> 01:03:59.470
You know. I put a
lot of time into it.

1132
01:03:59.505 --> 01:04:02.110
not just writing the playbook.

1133
01:04:02.145 --> 01:04:05.047
but like prep
hours. lesson plans.

1134
01:04:05.082 --> 01:04:08.083
So we're a few days from
coming back from summer break

1135
01:04:08.118 --> 01:04:10.921
and I find out that
Principal Kabasis

1136
01:04:10.956 --> 01:04:13.517
reallocated the budget
funds for the class.

1137
01:04:13.552 --> 01:04:16.652
- We gotta go.
- I'm not leaving her here.

1138
01:04:16.687 --> 01:04:20.491
- So the class got cut.

1139
01:04:20.526 --> 01:04:23.593
They spread out the kids
into different electives

1140
01:04:23.628 --> 01:04:27.630
and I went back to
another awesome year

1141
01:04:27.665 --> 01:04:30.303
of teaching history.

1142
01:04:30.338 --> 01:04:31.204
But it's funny. I always.

1143
01:04:31.239 --> 01:04:34.538
I always wondered what
would have happened

1144
01:04:34.573 --> 01:04:37.541
if I had gotten the chance
to put that play on.

1145
01:04:39.347 --> 01:04:41.314
And now. I don't have to wonder.

1146
01:04:41.349 --> 01:04:43.316
This is it. It's
happening right now.

1147
01:04:43.351 --> 01:04:45.956
I have a cast. It's amazing.

1148
01:04:45.991 --> 01:04:47.353
- Mr. Dunbar. please.

1149
01:04:52.195 --> 01:04:53.623
- She seems really scared.

1150
01:04:55.231 --> 01:04:57.396
Either that. or she's a
really. really good actress.

1151
01:05:05.010 --> 01:05:07.538
You wanna try for extra credit?

1152
01:05:07.573 --> 01:05:09.375
- Mm-hmm.

1153
01:05:10.077 --> 01:05:13.214
- Three questions. no mistakes.

1154
01:05:13.249 --> 01:05:15.986
Get three in a row.
you live. okay?

1155
01:05:16.021 --> 01:05:18.648
You good on that? Perfect.

1156
01:05:18.683 --> 01:05:20.089
So am I.

1157
01:05:20.124 --> 01:05:21.618
All right. first one.

1158
01:05:21.653 --> 01:05:23.290
this is a. it's a layup.

1159
01:05:23.325 --> 01:05:24.159
it's an easy one.

1160
01:05:25.459 --> 01:05:29.032
name the president that
helped free the slaves.

1161
01:05:30.530 --> 01:05:31.331
Sorry.

1162
01:05:33.335 --> 01:05:34.268
- Abraham Lincoln.

1163
01:05:37.537 --> 01:05:40.406
- What war did he preside over?

1164
01:05:40.441 --> 01:05:42.045
- The C-Civil War.

1165
01:05:43.345 --> 01:05:45.048
- She's very good.

1166
01:05:45.083 --> 01:05:47.413
Sadie. a little
competition for you.

1167
01:05:52.585 --> 01:05:54.321
Who killed Abraham Lincoln?

1168
01:05:58.096 --> 01:05:59.623
I know. that's a hard one.

1169
01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:04.562
I'll give you three clues. okay?

1170
01:06:06.269 --> 01:06:09.435
He shot Lincoln in
the back of the head.

1171
01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:12.042
he escaped from the
scene of the crime.

1172
01:06:13.276 --> 01:06:15.705
and he has three names.

1173
01:06:20.481 --> 01:06:22.415
- Wait. Wait. I know this.

1174
01:06:23.550 --> 01:06:24.384
I know this.

1175
01:06:24.419 --> 01:06:26.221
Three. three word name.

1176
01:06:29.688 --> 01:06:30.786
Lee Harvey Oswald.

1177
01:06:31.822 --> 01:06:36.363
- Gen. no. no.

1178
01:06:36.398 --> 01:06:40.433
- No. No

1179
01:06:45.341 --> 01:06:46.373
- Almost.

1180
01:06:47.607 --> 01:06:49.607
- No! Oh god.

1181
01:06:49.642 --> 01:06:54.645
- Let's go!

1182
01:06:57.881 --> 01:06:59.452
- In here. come on.

1183
01:07:00.422 --> 01:07:02.125
He's locked up the doors.

1184
01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:05.095
All the windows
have bars on them.

1185
01:07:05.130 --> 01:07:07.493
- We can't leave. we can't call.

1186
01:07:07.528 --> 01:07:08.626
- Does the school
have any landlines?

1187
01:07:08.661 --> 01:07:09.858
What does your mom use?

1188
01:07:09.893 --> 01:07:12.135
- All the landlines
are on a channel.

1189
01:07:12.170 --> 01:07:13.400
where the main office calls out.

1190
01:07:13.435 --> 01:07:14.698
That's too far on the
other side of campus.

1191
01:07:14.733 --> 01:07:16.205
- He's probably
cut them anyways.

1192
01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:17.371
- We can't get to
our cell phones.

1193
01:07:17.406 --> 01:07:18.801
unless you have
another one. I don't.

1194
01:07:22.345 --> 01:07:23.542
- What?

1195
01:07:23.577 --> 01:07:25.544
- There is one.

1196
01:07:25.579 --> 01:07:26.875
- What? What do you mean?

1197
01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:28.283
You have another phone?

1198
01:07:28.318 --> 01:07:30.120
- No. Coach Bird
keeps one his office.

1199
01:07:30.155 --> 01:07:31.319
- What?

1200
01:07:31.354 --> 01:07:33.288
- He keeps a old burner
phone in his drawer.

1201
01:07:33.323 --> 01:07:35.191
I seen him use it at the
Ultimate Frisbee Competition.

1202
01:07:35.226 --> 01:07:36.786
But I mean. we all
think he has something

1203
01:07:36.821 --> 01:07:37.721
going on on the side.

1204
01:07:37.756 --> 01:07:38.656
I mean. he's married. but-

1205
01:07:38.691 --> 01:07:40.427
- No. you have to double back.

1206
01:07:40.462 --> 01:07:41.824
You could be walking
right into him.

1207
01:07:41.859 --> 01:07:42.759
- We can't go anywhere.

1208
01:07:42.794 --> 01:07:44.167
Everything is sealed off!

1209
01:07:45.103 --> 01:07:47.830
Either we find a way
to call or we die here.

1210
01:07:47.865 --> 01:07:48.699
That's it.

1211
01:07:51.407 --> 01:07:53.704
- I don't wanna be left alone.

1212
01:07:55.741 --> 01:07:58.280
- Look. just stay put. okay?

1213
01:07:59.481 --> 01:08:02.218
I'm coming back. I'm
coning right back.

1214
01:08:02.253 --> 01:08:04.418
- Please stop. I'm scared.

1215
01:08:08.292 --> 01:08:09.522
- I'm scared too.

1216
01:08:11.559 --> 01:08:13.394
But this is the
only shot we have.

1217
01:08:41.325 --> 01:08:42.852
That is one of the
fastest suicides

1218
01:08:42.887 --> 01:08:44.491
that I've ever seen run.

1219
01:08:44.526 --> 01:08:48.330
For real. And believe me. I
subbed a lot of PE classes.

1220
01:08:50.466 --> 01:08:51.762
- Ah! Ah!

1221
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:57.240
Fuck!

1222
01:08:57.275 --> 01:08:58.934
- I wouldn't worry about it.

1223
01:09:04.447 --> 01:09:06.513
You'll be okay. Just
put some ice on it.

1224
01:09:10.882 --> 01:09:15.819
- Fuck.

1225
01:09:35.874 --> 01:09:37.313
- And you're not supposed to be

1226
01:09:37.348 --> 01:09:39.447
in the coach's
office unattended.

1227
01:09:45.048 --> 01:09:47.015
- Come on. come on.
come on. come on. come on.

1228
01:09:47.050 --> 01:09:47.884
Yes! Fuck.

1229
01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:54.957
My name is Trevor
Bentel and I need help.

1230
01:09:58.699 --> 01:09:59.698
Somebody's trying to k-

1231
01:09:59.733 --> 01:10:04.736
Somebody's trying to f-

1232
01:10:18.587 --> 01:10:19.619
- I
like it when you open up

1233
01:10:19.654 --> 01:10:20.620
with your thoughts.

1234
01:10:21.788 --> 01:10:24.261
The game demands
strategic thinking.

1235
01:10:26.529 --> 01:10:28.562
The game. ladies and gentlemen.

1236
01:10:28.597 --> 01:10:32.896
is captured the flag.

1237
01:12:13.768 --> 01:12:14.602
- Sadie!

1238
01:12:39.728 --> 01:12:42.025
- Exact- Exactly.

1239
01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:45.501
Exactly.

1240
01:14:39.617 --> 01:14:41.144
- It's a beauty contest.

1241
01:14:41.179 --> 01:14:42.244
right. Lilah?

1242
01:14:44.589 --> 01:14:47.051
Lets bring out our
animal contestants!

1243
01:14:52.157 --> 01:14:54.663
- Hey. baby. Hi.

1244
01:14:55.831 --> 01:14:57.160
Look at you.

1245
01:14:57.195 --> 01:14:59.063
I love you. I miss you.

1246
01:14:59.098 --> 01:15:00.801
What are you doing?

1247
01:15:00.836 --> 01:15:04.805
- I'm just watching the
TV and Mommy is sleeping.

1248
01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:07.038
- It is really late.
You should be sleeping.

1249
01:15:08.041 --> 01:15:08.875
What did you-

1250
01:15:10.945 --> 01:15:12.978
- What are you doing calling me?

1251
01:15:13.013 --> 01:15:15.178
- Can you put Sierra
back on. on the phone?

1252
01:15:15.213 --> 01:15:16.982
- No.
- Please.

1253
01:15:18.887 --> 01:15:21.822
- You have a lot of gall
calling after that shit

1254
01:15:21.857 --> 01:15:23.824
you pulled with the
bike the other day.

1255
01:15:30.701 --> 01:15:31.326
- I'm sorry.

1256
01:15:32.934 --> 01:15:33.966
- You're sorry?

1257
01:15:36.036 --> 01:15:36.870
That's a first.

1258
01:15:39.369 --> 01:15:42.238
- It might've been
the first time I've said it.

1259
01:15:42.273 --> 01:15:46.110
but it is definitely not
the first time I've been it.

1260
01:15:48.345 --> 01:15:50.917
- What do you want?

1261
01:15:58.894 --> 01:16:00.960
- It is really over. isn't it?

1262
01:16:00.995 --> 01:16:02.665
We're over. I get that.

1263
01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:03.930
I understand that now.

1264
01:16:10.004 --> 01:16:11.872
I just tried so freaking hard.

1265
01:16:11.907 --> 01:16:13.676
I did. I tried. really.

1266
01:16:15.779 --> 01:16:17.944
I want you to know that.

1267
01:16:21.686 --> 01:16:22.685
- I know. I do.

1268
01:16:25.349 --> 01:16:26.953
- I know. I know you do.

1269
01:16:29.892 --> 01:16:32.992
You gave up.

1270
01:16:33.929 --> 01:16:34.862
Just don't ever forget that.

1271
01:16:34.897 --> 01:16:36.358
You're the one that gave up.

1272
01:16:36.393 --> 01:16:40.329
- No. Listen. I just knew
when it was time to go.

1273
01:16:40.364 --> 01:16:41.902
That's something
you something you.

1274
01:16:43.807 --> 01:16:46.170
that's something you
never figured out.

1275
01:16:46.205 --> 01:16:50.273
- I guess I was
too late for that then. huh?

1276
01:17:01.792 --> 01:17:05.728
listen. the hex bolt for
the. for the bike to.

1277
01:17:05.763 --> 01:17:06.993
to put it all back together

1278
01:17:07.028 --> 01:17:09.732
is in the top drawer in my desk.

1279
01:17:12.132 --> 01:17:12.966
- John. where are you?

1280
01:17:18.776 --> 01:17:19.940
- Can you do me a favor?

1281
01:17:19.975 --> 01:17:21.810
Just tell Sierra that
I really love her.

1282
01:17:23.011 --> 01:17:25.110
that I do. and you too.

1283
01:17:27.983 --> 01:17:31.050
- Forget the bike. tell
me where you're at.

1284
01:18:49.229 --> 01:18:51.097
- Do you know why I
saved you for last?

1285
01:18:53.167 --> 01:18:54.199
- What do you want?

1286
01:18:55.334 --> 01:18:57.136
- Do you know why you're last?

1287
01:19:03.243 --> 01:19:04.110
You're not last.

1288
01:19:09.854 --> 01:19:12.547
I never had any
intention of hurting you.

1289
01:19:12.582 --> 01:19:13.988
Mr. Dunbar. you-

1290
01:19:14.023 --> 01:19:16.826
- Don't call me Mr.
Dunbar. Call me John.

1291
01:19:16.861 --> 01:19:18.388
Let's just stop playing games.

1292
01:19:24.033 --> 01:19:25.131
- I don't wanna be here.

1293
01:19:30.138 --> 01:19:32.237
- What do you mean?

1294
01:19:32.272 --> 01:19:34.338
What do you mean you
don't wanna be here?

1295
01:19:34.373 --> 01:19:36.175
- I don't wanna be here.

1296
01:19:39.279 --> 01:19:42.247
- Remember when we were
texting on the phone

1297
01:19:42.282 --> 01:19:45.613
right after you gave me
your number on Instagram?

1298
01:19:45.648 --> 01:19:47.615
- That was for school.
It was for an assignment.

1299
01:19:47.650 --> 01:19:49.221
- You were flirting with me.

1300
01:19:49.256 --> 01:19:50.387
- No. I was not
flirting with you!

1301
01:19:50.422 --> 01:19:51.520
- Yes you were.
- No.

1302
01:19:51.555 --> 01:19:52.323
I wasn't.
- Then why did you

1303
01:19:52.358 --> 01:19:53.555
give me your number?

1304
01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:55.029
- I didn't mean to.
- Really. why did you

1305
01:19:55.064 --> 01:19:56.228
give me your number?
- I didn't mean to!

1306
01:19:56.263 --> 01:19:57.933
I'm stupid! I'm a
stupid teenager. man.

1307
01:19:57.968 --> 01:19:59.132
What do you want me to say?

1308
01:20:00.135 --> 01:20:01.167
I'm sorry.

1309
01:20:11.179 --> 01:20:13.344
- Remember when you
said that you wished.

1310
01:20:14.985 --> 01:20:18.217
sometimes. that you could
start school all over again?

1311
01:20:18.252 --> 01:20:20.252
- Everyone says that.

1312
01:20:20.287 --> 01:20:21.319
- You can.

1313
01:20:23.290 --> 01:20:24.421
You can. we can.

1314
01:20:26.227 --> 01:20:27.897
We can move somewhere else.

1315
01:20:30.264 --> 01:20:32.462
And I can get a respectable job.

1316
01:20:36.204 --> 01:20:39.601
but I need to have
someone strong

1317
01:20:39.636 --> 01:20:41.306
beside me for that.

1318
01:20:49.250 --> 01:20:51.151
You know how many
years of my life

1319
01:20:51.186 --> 01:20:53.417
I've lost to this fucking job?

1320
01:20:55.289 --> 01:20:57.355
And I refuse to believe

1321
01:20:58.358 --> 01:21:00.193
that it's too late for me.

1322
01:21:00.228 --> 01:21:01.062
I refuse.

1323
01:21:04.364 --> 01:21:07.200
Come here. Come here.

1324
01:21:18.983 --> 01:21:22.116
Everyone deserves a
second chance. everyone.

1325
01:21:24.252 --> 01:21:27.154
And I know that you don't
understand that now.

1326
01:21:27.189 --> 01:21:28.023
but you will.

1327
01:22:03.192 --> 01:22:05.995
You were always
the cleverest one.

1328
01:22:10.430 --> 01:22:13.464
- Sir!
Put the gun down!

1329
01:22:13.499 --> 01:22:15.136
- Sir!
- Hey. guys.

1330
01:22:15.171 --> 01:22:16.731
- Step away from the girl!
- Don't. don't start yelling.

1331
01:22:16.766 --> 01:22:19.437
Okay? We're having
a conversation here.

1332
01:22:19.472 --> 01:22:20.735
- Put the gun down.

1333
01:22:20.770 --> 01:22:22.638
- I'm a public
servant also. okay?

1334
01:22:22.673 --> 01:22:25.278
- Step away.
- Put the gun down.

1335
01:22:25.313 --> 01:22:26.312
I'm not asking again.

1336
01:22:26.347 --> 01:22:28.314
- I'm one of the good guys too.

1337
01:22:28.349 --> 01:22:30.415
- Drop the gun.
- We're all good guys.

1338
01:22:30.450 --> 01:22:31.746
- Sir. drop the gun.

1339
01:22:33.255 --> 01:22:35.453
- Sadie. are we gonna
do this or what?
