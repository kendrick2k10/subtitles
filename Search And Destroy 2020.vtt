(Indistinct shouting)

26
00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:30.901
Lieutenant. he's leaking too bad!

27
00:02:30.943 --> 00:02:32.862
There's not much
I can do about it here.

28
00:02:33.612 --> 00:02:35.865
(John) It felt like
I had been here before.

29
00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:38.951
so many times.

30
00:02:41.036 --> 00:02:43.831
It's just a matter of time
before they roll down.

31
00:02:43.873 --> 00:02:46.375
(John)
I didn't even know who they were.

32
00:02:46.417 --> 00:02:48.669
Everything was starting
to blur together.

33
00:02:49.753 --> 00:02:52.047
I had fought so many battles.

34
00:02:52.715 --> 00:02:56.343
-Faced so many adversaries.
-(Eagles screeching)

35
00:02:56.385 --> 00:02:58.012
There's a haze.

36
00:02:59.847 --> 00:03:02.558
She told me that if I left
she wouldn't take me back.

37
00:03:03.934 --> 00:03:05.185
So I left.

38
00:03:06.562 --> 00:03:08.856
Maybe that was a mistake.

39
00:03:16.614 --> 00:03:18.198
Where the fuck are they coming from?

40
00:03:18.824 --> 00:03:22.286
That's me... Lieutenant John Cutter.
Rangers.

41
00:03:22.328 --> 00:03:25.039
We've been tasked
to rescue a VIP and his family

42
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.708
from a small terrorist cell
in West Africa.

43
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.919
What we didn't know
is they were being led

44
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.962
by the world's most
notorious war criminal.

45
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.132
Igor Rodin.

46
00:03:35.925 --> 00:03:40.512
Rodin headed up a multi-national
terrorist organisation.

47
00:03:40.554 --> 00:03:42.848
with militias from around the world

48
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.267
that he could call on... anytime.

49
00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:46.644
American Rangers.

50
00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:48.270
American Rangers.

51
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.648
Cease fire. you are surrounded.

52
00:03:51.774 --> 00:03:55.319
Sir. We are completely surrounded.

53
00:03:56.403 --> 00:03:58.405
We were completely surrounded.

54
00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.699
(Indistinct shouting)

55
00:04:01.325 --> 00:04:04.411
I was having second thoughts
about this mission.

56
00:04:05.704 --> 00:04:08.999
Some things just didn't add up.

57
00:04:10.084 --> 00:04:14.171
Sir. what the fuck
are we gonna do?

58
00:04:15.756 --> 00:04:19.718
Return fire on these assholes.
Keep it tight. Conserve your ammo.

59
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.845
D-Bo. get me command on the line.

60
00:04:21.887 --> 00:04:23.639
-And. Keyes...
-Sir!

61
00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:25.474
Intel said this used to be
a mining camp.

62
00:04:25.516 --> 00:04:26.642
There's tunnels leading out of here.

63
00:04:26.684 --> 00:04:28.310
You find me an exit
and you do it fast!

64
00:04:28.352 --> 00:04:29.395
Copy.

65
00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:30.479
(Gun firing continues)

66
00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:36.694
Lieutenant. I've got
Colonel Anderson for you.

67
00:04:38.195 --> 00:04:39.238
Colonel.

68
00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.031
I thought everything
was under control.

69
00:04:41.073 --> 00:04:42.616
Now what the hell happened?

70
00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:46.662
What's happened?
I'll tell you what fucking happened.

71
00:04:46.704 --> 00:04:47.746
Your intel was for shit.

72
00:04:47.788 --> 00:04:49.665
There's a full rebel brigade
out there. mechanised.

73
00:04:49.707 --> 00:04:51.458
Cutter. calm down.

74
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.586
I'll calm down once you give me
my QRF. I need air support.

75
00:04:54.628 --> 00:04:56.296
These bastards have armour.

76
00:04:58.924 --> 00:05:01.093
-We're gonna die. aren't we?
-(Woman) Adam!

77
00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:04.847
No. sir. you will not.
Seven minutes. Copy that.

78
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.598
Give them our coordinates.

79
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.435
Roger. Control. Friendlies on
the ground and heavy assault.

80
00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:11.061
Proceeding with new coordinates.

81
00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:29.038
Carter. get the family
to the next room. We're leaving.

82
00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:30.789
Fire!

83
00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:35.335
(Grunts)

84
00:05:41.008 --> 00:05:42.051
No!

85
00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:45.262
(Distorted) No!

86
00:05:47.473 --> 00:05:49.558
(Gun firing)

87
00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:56.190
(Soldiers screaming)

88
00:06:10.954 --> 00:06:11.997
(Yells)

89
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.433
Motherfuckers!

90
00:06:31.475 --> 00:06:32.976
They must have called for support.

91
00:06:33.018 --> 00:06:36.188
-Keyes. you find me that back door?
-I can't find shit!

92
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.232
Keep it frosty. Keyes.
sweep the other rooms.

93
00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:52.830
Sir. I think I found something.

94
00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.004
-(D-Bo) Keyes!
-Sir.

95
00:07:01.547 --> 00:07:03.924
Fuck. Joe. how you doing. man?

96
00:07:03.966 --> 00:07:04.967
Oh. shit.

97
00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:07.678
OK.

98
00:07:08.887 --> 00:07:10.764
Slow. slow. slow.

99
00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:14.059
-I'll go check on the guys.
-Suck it up.

100
00:07:17.563 --> 00:07:20.816
We gotta get the fuck out of here.
Come on. man. Get you up

101
00:07:35.581 --> 00:07:37.082
D-Bo!

102
00:07:48.719 --> 00:07:50.470
(Panting)

103
00:07:55.767 --> 00:07:57.186
John.

104
00:07:57.895 --> 00:07:59.980
-How many guys?
-They're gone.

105
00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:02.691
Harris?

106
00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:05.485
(Man on radio) Pendulum.
This is Castle.

107
00:08:05.527 --> 00:08:07.362
we're making our in.
Mark your position.

108
00:08:07.404 --> 00:08:09.781
Danger's close. ready one.
drop on our position.

109
00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:12.868
I repeat danger's close.
drop on our position.

110
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:15.412
All right. Pendulum.
it's your ass. cover up.

111
00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:18.999
(John grunts) Come on.

112
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.043
I got you.

113
00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:23.712
-(Gunfire)
-(Keyes screaming)

114
00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:26.340
(Both groan)

115
00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.216
(Dog barking)

116
00:09:09.258 --> 00:09:11.677
(John) All right. boy. let's go. Up.

117
00:09:13.262 --> 00:09:16.265
Rest up. You're gonna need
your strength today.

118
00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:18.725
You little son of a gun.

119
00:09:30.404 --> 00:09:31.947
Been a while. Lieutenant.

120
00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:36.868
Yes. sir.

121
00:09:37.703 --> 00:09:40.038
Congratulations on the promotion.
General.

122
00:09:40.289 --> 00:09:42.291
And how's the guide business?

123
00:09:42.332 --> 00:09:44.418
-Looking to do some hunting?
-I am.

124
00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:47.796
-The season starts in October.
-Terrorists are always in season.

125
00:09:51.174 --> 00:09:52.592
I'm out. General.

126
00:09:53.677 --> 00:09:56.305
-This is something different.
-Well. I was discharged.

127
00:09:56.346 --> 00:09:58.807
You're going on a private contract.
We do it all the time.

128
00:09:58.849 --> 00:10:01.226
You're qualified.
You're in good shape.

129
00:10:01.268 --> 00:10:06.189
General. I'm no good. I failed.
I left my team behind.

130
00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:09.359
John. they were dead.
Africa was a rough gig.

131
00:10:09.401 --> 00:10:11.945
You think we sent the Rangers in
because it was easy?

132
00:10:12.195 --> 00:10:14.656
We teach you guys everything
except how to fail.

133
00:10:14.698 --> 00:10:17.951
My God. you'd think
we'd have figured that one out by now.

134
00:10:17.993 --> 00:10:20.203
John. it wasn't your fault.

135
00:10:20.746 --> 00:10:22.539
Then whose fault was it?

136
00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:25.125
Those men were my responsibility.

137
00:10:25.167 --> 00:10:27.961
Listen. John. Joey's still alive
because of you.

138
00:10:28.378 --> 00:10:30.589
The truth is. I need you for this.

139
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.174
Your country needs you.

140
00:10:32.466 --> 00:10:34.134
You're a good soldier. General.

141
00:10:35.302 --> 00:10:37.137
But a shitty salesman.

142
00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:40.724
OK. Igor Rodin.

143
00:10:42.768 --> 00:10:44.186
He's the target.

144
00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:47.356
Igor Rodin is dead.

145
00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:50.067
-Intel said the air...
-Intel was wrong.

146
00:10:51.109 --> 00:10:55.489
-He was shot there.
-John. please. I need you to ID him.

147
00:10:57.699 --> 00:10:59.201
(Car engine starting)

148
00:11:07.918 --> 00:11:09.127
(Indistinct radio chatter)

149
00:11:11.254 --> 00:11:13.340
(Sonar beeping)

150
00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:27.396
-Shitty salesman. huh?
-Some things sell themselves.

151
00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:30.607
Thanks for being here.
Let's go meet the guys.

152
00:11:35.237 --> 00:11:36.446
-Gentlemen.
-Sir.

153
00:11:36.488 --> 00:11:37.572
(All) General!

154
00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:39.699
This is Mr Cutter.
civilian contractor.

155
00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:42.244
background airborne.
ex-officer in the Rangers.

156
00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:45.247
Mr Cutter has met our target
and will ID him for us.

157
00:11:45.288 --> 00:11:47.040
Chief. take us through
the rest of the op.

158
00:11:47.082 --> 00:11:48.166
All right. guys. listen up.

159
00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:51.586
This is a direct action operation.
Capture or kill the target.

160
00:11:51.628 --> 00:11:54.881
We go in as Legion One. We're about
20 nautical miles offshore.

161
00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:57.467
2100. hit that water.
swim the rest of the way.

162
00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:59.678
Mr Cutter. you are scuba certified.
I assume.

163
00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:01.930
-(John) Six weeks at NDSTC.
-Good enough.

164
00:12:01.972 --> 00:12:05.392
This ain't no dip in the pool.
These Albanians are paranoid as shit.

165
00:12:05.434 --> 00:12:07.853
Activity around the port
will be extremely high.

166
00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:10.939
At least a dozen soldiers and a few
boats patrolling in the water.

167
00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:13.400
-Who's the target?
-Igor Rodin.

168
00:12:13.442 --> 00:12:15.986
Interpol has a file on him
10 pages long.

169
00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:18.780
But he now seems to be
upping his game.

170
00:12:18.822 --> 00:12:22.617
We tracked him buying up toxic waste
from a base here in Eastern Europe.

171
00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:25.996
Munitions dump. He's gotten hold
of 300.000 gallons

172
00:12:26.037 --> 00:12:28.373
of some of the worst shit
known to mankind.

173
00:12:28.415 --> 00:12:30.876
Now the toxic barrels by themselves
don't amount to much.

174
00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:34.546
But coupled with the right bomb.
a sizable chunk of this planet

175
00:12:34.588 --> 00:12:36.840
will be uninhabitable
for the next 200 years.

176
00:12:36.882 --> 00:12:38.717
That's where the three scientists
come in.

177
00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:40.051
(Anderson)
Three scientists went missing.

178
00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:42.637
Chemical engineer. physicist.
mechanical engineer.

179
00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:45.515
By themselves. not one of them
is capable of making a bomb.

180
00:12:45.557 --> 00:12:48.477
But together. that's one hell
of a lethal cocktail.

181
00:12:48.518 --> 00:12:50.187
We have a six-hour window.

182
00:12:50.228 --> 00:12:51.938
If they finish the assembly.
we're done.

183
00:12:52.314 --> 00:12:53.899
I advise you all
to familiarise yourself

184
00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.358
with the details in your logs.

185
00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.651
Any questions?

186
00:12:56.693 --> 00:12:58.570
Gentlemen.
I've got to make a transmission.

187
00:13:01.198 --> 00:13:03.158
All right. boys. get some rest.

188
00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.411
-John. I'll catch you pre-mission.
-Yes. sir.

189
00:13:15.712 --> 00:13:17.964
-John Cutter.
-Yeah.

190
00:13:18.006 --> 00:13:19.216
Lieutenant John Cutter.

191
00:13:20.425 --> 00:13:21.676
I used to be.

192
00:13:21.718 --> 00:13:24.095
JSOC. Africa Command.
three years ago.

193
00:13:24.471 --> 00:13:27.015
-Yeah. that's me.
-Lost your team.

194
00:13:28.517 --> 00:13:31.186
-Something like that.
-Heard you washed out.

195
00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:35.106
It's pretty hard to go on
giving orders after that one. Chief.

196
00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:37.859
I bet. It was pretty rough stuff.

197
00:13:40.946 --> 00:13:44.449
I know FUBAR. man. I don't judge you.

198
00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:47.494
-What are you getting at. Chief?
-Why are you coming with us?

199
00:13:47.536 --> 00:13:49.204
Just stay here on the sub.

200
00:13:49.704 --> 00:13:51.414
We'll send you back
a video after we kill Rodin

201
00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:52.499
and you can confirm it on datalink.

202
00:13:52.541 --> 00:13:54.793
The General thinks
I need to be there.

203
00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:56.920
I'm the only one that knows
what Rodin looks like.

204
00:13:56.962 --> 00:13:59.714
We're after a bomb.
This ain't a personal vendetta.

205
00:13:59.756 --> 00:14:03.134
-Too late.
-I got six guys I gotta get home.

206
00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:05.387
-Copy?
-Yeah. I copy.

207
00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:06.555
Good.

208
00:14:07.222 --> 00:14:10.642
We've got about six hours. then
this thing dumps us in the Adriatic.

209
00:14:10.684 --> 00:14:13.979
I want you to ask yourself.
"Am I good to go?"

210
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.940
If you're not all in.
you do us all a favour...

211
00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:21.653
Don't go.

212
00:14:33.582 --> 00:14:36.001
-(John) Nice family.
-Thanks. man.

213
00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:38.253
Never easy to say goodbye. you know.

214
00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:45.468
-I'm Marcus Cooper. Call me Coop.
-John Cutter.

215
00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.220
Welcome aboard. John.

216
00:14:47.262 --> 00:14:49.222
-So. you got kids?
-No.

217
00:14:49.723 --> 00:14:51.600
-A wife?
-No.

218
00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:52.934
-Girlfriend?
-(Chuckles)

219
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.937
-Well. there's Spud.
-Spud?

220
00:14:55.979 --> 00:14:59.274
-Yeah. he's a Golden Lab mix.
-OK. man's best friend. right?

221
00:14:59.316 --> 00:15:00.775
As long as I'm feeding him.

222
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.653
-I'm gonna sack out.
-Cool. man.

223
00:15:10.702 --> 00:15:12.954
(♪ Upbeat music playing)

224
00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:22.339
(Indistinct chatter)

225
00:15:29.721 --> 00:15:32.390
Look. Nina. I wanna do this job
and go home.

226
00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:35.018
And you know he'll kill us
the minute it's finished.

227
00:15:36.978 --> 00:15:39.397
If you believe that.
why keep working?

228
00:15:40.523 --> 00:15:42.817
Because any hope is better than that.

229
00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:44.569
Hope?

230
00:15:46.112 --> 00:15:49.824
I've seen hope drives people across
the desert. thousands of miles.

231
00:15:50.617 --> 00:15:53.787
only to die of starvation
the moment they find the food.

232
00:15:54.871 --> 00:15:56.581
I have seen the hope drive the people

233
00:15:56.623 --> 00:15:58.792
day after day
to some shitty factories.

234
00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:04.005
until after 80 years. they simply
expired. And you say hope.

235
00:16:06.508 --> 00:16:07.801
He needs a hospital.

236
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:14.224
-I need my bomb quicker.
-We're moving as fast as we can.

237
00:16:14.265 --> 00:16:15.684
You had better be.

238
00:16:16.226 --> 00:16:18.103
What if I start the reaction now.

239
00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:21.690
and blow us all to hell?

240
00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.568
Then at the very least.
I would be pleasantly surprised.

241
00:16:29.364 --> 00:16:31.783
-Do it.
-Don't tempt me.

242
00:16:32.409 --> 00:16:33.451
Do it.

243
00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:38.498
(Machine whirring and beeping)

244
00:16:46.923 --> 00:16:48.091
Nina.

245
00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:51.219
(Machine continues beeping)

246
00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:57.726
But what will that do for your hope?

247
00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:04.065
Bye!

248
00:17:05.734 --> 00:17:06.818
(Beeping stops)

249
00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:35.638
(Chief) Stay tight. We don't wanna
make a wave signature.

250
00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.099
Rodin's underwater sensors
are so sensitive

251
00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:40.769
that if a shark were to take a shit.

252
00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:43.938
they would pick
that shit up. literally.

253
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:48.026
(Danimal) Cutter. where'd you say
you earned your scuba cert?

254
00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:49.861
The local YMCA?

255
00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:53.364
(John) NDSTC.

256
00:17:55.658 --> 00:17:57.952
(Indistinct chatter)

257
00:18:13.676 --> 00:18:16.596
(John) Slow it down. gents.
These mines are hot.

258
00:18:16.638 --> 00:18:20.308
(Danimal) Shut up. Cutter.
I'll swim as fast as I goddamn want.

259
00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:22.143
(Coop)
Danimal. I would listen to Cutter.

260
00:18:22.185 --> 00:18:24.270
(Danimal)
Whose side are you on. Coop?

261
00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:26.397
(John) Just keep it tight.

262
00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:28.817
(Danimal) Heard about the last time
you were on a mission. Cutter.

263
00:18:28.858 --> 00:18:30.443
You lost five fucking men.

264
00:18:30.485 --> 00:18:32.529
(John) Don't talk about things
you don't know about.

265
00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:36.407
(Chief) Hey. we're on a mission here.
Now get your shit in line. Cutter.

266
00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:44.415
(Coop) Cutter. don't listen to
what the fuck they're saying.

267
00:18:44.457 --> 00:18:45.875
Bunch of dicks.

268
00:18:45.917 --> 00:18:47.752
Let's just keep it moving.

269
00:18:47.794 --> 00:18:49.212
Good one. Cutter.

270
00:18:49.254 --> 00:18:50.338
(John) Come on. Coop.

271
00:18:52.924 --> 00:18:56.719
(Danimal) Look at me. Cutter.
I'm not keeping it tight.

272
00:18:57.178 --> 00:18:58.555
(John) Fucking asshole.

273
00:18:59.722 --> 00:19:01.015
(Danimal) Oh. my. Oh. my fucking...

274
00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:04.686
(John) Danimal! Danimal!
(Danimal) What the fuck?

275
00:19:04.727 --> 00:19:06.145
(Explosion)

276
00:19:10.525 --> 00:19:12.610
(Alarm beeping)

277
00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:19.367
-I need divers in the water now.
-(Diver 1) Roger that.

278
00:19:19.868 --> 00:19:23.663
(Diver 2) Let's make this fast.
I have hot date tonight.

279
00:19:33.298 --> 00:19:35.091
(Chief) Well. they know
we're here now. gents.

280
00:19:35.383 --> 00:19:36.593
Double-time it.

281
00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:42.432
(Indistinct shouting)

282
00:19:48.897 --> 00:19:50.815
-Mr Rodin.
-What. Nikola?

283
00:19:50.857 --> 00:19:53.026
One of our underwater mines
was triggered.

284
00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:56.654
I have deployed divers. but it may be
the incursion you feared.

285
00:19:56.696 --> 00:19:58.197
By the time they report in...

286
00:19:58.239 --> 00:20:00.992
We may not have the time
to finish the bomb.

287
00:20:01.034 --> 00:20:03.077
No matter. We'll finish it en route.

288
00:20:03.745 --> 00:20:05.705
Dr Islav. we are moving on.

289
00:20:05.747 --> 00:20:08.333
Bring with you only what
you need to finish the project.

290
00:20:08.374 --> 00:20:09.667
What about Yuri?

291
00:20:12.003 --> 00:20:13.588
He is not needed any more.

292
00:20:14.547 --> 00:20:16.966
-(Gunshot)
-(Screams)

293
00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:21.262
Prepare yourselves to leave.

294
00:20:23.056 --> 00:20:25.224
The time is not on our side. Doctor.

295
00:20:26.684 --> 00:20:29.520
He was never going to recover.
We both know that.

296
00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:37.320
-Now! Go.
-(Nikola) Move.

297
00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:49.332
(Chief) We got this. boys.
Remember your training.

298
00:21:09.102 --> 00:21:11.604
(Diver 1) You and Miguel
go to discotheque?

299
00:21:11.646 --> 00:21:15.775
(Diver 2) No. Miguel's on barrel duty.
I'm taking Tomas.

300
00:21:15.817 --> 00:21:17.485
He knows how to tango.

301
00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:20.321
(Chief) Go. go. go.

302
00:21:22.156 --> 00:21:23.992
Go. go. go.

303
00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:32.959
(Diver 1) American scum!

304
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:35.795
(Chief) Go. go. go. go. go.
go. go!

305
00:21:42.176 --> 00:21:43.761
(Diver 1 groans)

306
00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:45.388
No!

307
00:21:49.559 --> 00:21:54.856
(Chief) Cutter. You know your shit.
I wish Danimal had listened.

308
00:21:59.694 --> 00:22:01.904
Why do you hate God so much. Igor?

309
00:22:03.156 --> 00:22:04.907
Look at the world. Niki.

310
00:22:05.324 --> 00:22:08.453
The innocent suffer.
the guilty prosper.

311
00:22:08.494 --> 00:22:11.330
God made us in His image.
what does it tell you about Him?

312
00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.250
It means he is a motherfucker.
just like me.

313
00:22:19.213 --> 00:22:21.716
Can't this piece of shit
go any faster?

314
00:22:22.592 --> 00:22:24.385
We can't go faster than the truck.

315
00:22:24.427 --> 00:22:26.345
The truck has
2.000 kilos in the back.

316
00:22:26.971 --> 00:22:30.266
-Never mind. soon we'll be rich men.
-(Vladimir) I hope it's true.

317
00:22:30.475 --> 00:22:34.854
Don't hope. Vladimir. Hope is for
peasants and priests. We are soldiers.

318
00:22:34.896 --> 00:22:38.066
We are making our destiny.
We don't pray for it.

319
00:22:39.859 --> 00:22:42.361
(Indistinct chatter)

320
00:22:45.615 --> 00:22:48.034
(Diver) Miguel. counterclockwise.
Look.

321
00:22:48.076 --> 00:22:49.869
Come on. this not discotheque.

322
00:23:09.555 --> 00:23:10.848
(Water splashing)

323
00:23:17.396 --> 00:23:18.648
(Screams)

324
00:23:35.581 --> 00:23:37.708
(Indistinct conversation)

325
00:24:20.585 --> 00:24:21.711
(Beeping)

326
00:24:27.383 --> 00:24:29.343
(Man 1) Hurry up. They're inside.

327
00:24:29.385 --> 00:24:30.386
Where is Vishan?

328
00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:36.100
(Man 2) He called in fever sick.
I radio for replacement.

329
00:24:56.787 --> 00:25:00.124
Mikhail Bromislov.
reporting for replacement duty. sir.

330
00:25:00.166 --> 00:25:03.377
(Man 1) Mikhail. you're not
replacing anybody.

331
00:25:03.419 --> 00:25:05.504
(Mikhail) Please. give me chance.

332
00:25:06.422 --> 00:25:09.175
(Man 1) Fuck this up.
barrel duty for life.

333
00:25:12.511 --> 00:25:15.598
Hurry up with the charges.
Something doesn't look right.

334
00:25:17.516 --> 00:25:18.517
(Beeping)

335
00:25:19.644 --> 00:25:22.396
Hey. Chief. you better come see this.

336
00:25:23.231 --> 00:25:26.484
-Been dead nearly a half hour.
-Toxic waste.

337
00:25:26.525 --> 00:25:27.610
(Chief) Yeah.

338
00:25:28.694 --> 00:25:31.239
These tanks must be full
of whatever did that to him.

339
00:25:32.073 --> 00:25:33.074
(Chief) Let's go.

340
00:25:45.336 --> 00:25:46.671
Chief!

341
00:25:50.341 --> 00:25:52.426
(Indistinct shouting)

342
00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:11.696
(Shouting)

343
00:26:16.575 --> 00:26:18.327
Look at me. look at me!

344
00:26:19.704 --> 00:26:22.832
-We need to fucking move now.
-And go where. man?

345
00:26:22.873 --> 00:26:26.627
Danimal's dead. Russ is dead
and Chief's a fucking meatball.

346
00:26:27.044 --> 00:26:29.755
We just missed the target.
so we fucked that deal.

347
00:26:29.797 --> 00:26:31.090
(Chief coughs)

348
00:26:31.132 --> 00:26:33.676
We just pissed off the entire
fucking Albanian army.

349
00:26:34.176 --> 00:26:37.263
-Thought you SEALs were tough.
-(Chief) Pink!

350
00:26:38.472 --> 00:26:40.599
I ain't got many breaths left.

351
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:43.853
Don't make me waste 'em
running you down.

352
00:26:43.894 --> 00:26:45.980
(Breathing heavily)

353
00:26:47.273 --> 00:26:49.942
You stow your weapon and sharpen up.

354
00:26:54.363 --> 00:26:56.991
Let me hear you say.
"Aye-aye. Master Chief."

355
00:26:57.783 --> 00:26:59.243
Aye-aye. Master Chief.

356
00:27:01.787 --> 00:27:04.749
Now listen up.
Cutter's gonna get you home.

357
00:27:05.833 --> 00:27:08.252
You take orders from him from now on.

358
00:27:08.294 --> 00:27:10.629
-He's a fucking civ...
-He's an officer.

359
00:27:10.921 --> 00:27:14.550
You ain't qualified to make a tougher
choice than "paper or plastic."

360
00:27:15.968 --> 00:27:18.012
That's an order. Let me hear it!

361
00:27:18.054 --> 00:27:20.139
-Aye-aye. Master Chief.
-Aye-aye. Master Chief.

362
00:27:22.641 --> 00:27:24.435
You guys are a great team.

363
00:27:25.353 --> 00:27:27.396
I hate to bitch out at you like this.

364
00:27:28.939 --> 00:27:31.400
You just worry about
finding a way out of here.

365
00:27:31.859 --> 00:27:34.362
Find us a truck. We're moving out.
Go. Come on.

366
00:27:36.322 --> 00:27:37.698
(Alarm blaring)

367
00:27:44.747 --> 00:27:46.332
See you downrange.

368
00:27:46.999 --> 00:27:48.667
See you there. rookie.

369
00:28:05.601 --> 00:28:07.228
(Engine starting)

370
00:28:10.022 --> 00:28:13.317
-What the hell are you doing?
-You get my boys home.

371
00:28:15.569 --> 00:28:18.030
I don't exactly have
the best track record.

372
00:28:19.407 --> 00:28:22.284
You better. Or I will haunt your ass

373
00:28:22.326 --> 00:28:25.121
tier-1 poltergeist shit. you copy?

374
00:28:26.622 --> 00:28:29.708
-Yeah. copy.
-They knew we were coming here.

375
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:31.127
Something ain't right.

376
00:28:31.961 --> 00:28:34.088
What do you think
we should do. Chief?

377
00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:36.173
Call the General.
tell him you're coming back.

378
00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:40.511
-Roger that.
-Hand me that frag. will ya?

379
00:28:46.517 --> 00:28:48.185
(Breathing heavily)

380
00:28:58.737 --> 00:28:59.989
Good luck. Cutter.

381
00:29:08.456 --> 00:29:10.583
-Chief?
-Drive.

382
00:29:22.553 --> 00:29:24.763
Welcome. gentlemen.

383
00:29:26.765 --> 00:29:28.058
To hell!

384
00:29:44.825 --> 00:29:47.203
Sir. we have Legion One
on the sat link.

385
00:29:47.244 --> 00:29:49.205
-Chief Ryan?
-No. sir. Cutter.

386
00:29:53.542 --> 00:29:55.461
-John?
-General.

387
00:29:55.503 --> 00:29:57.796
-Where's Chief Ryan?
-He's gone.

388
00:29:58.506 --> 00:30:00.090
So is Dan and Russ.

389
00:30:00.883 --> 00:30:02.134
And Rodin?

390
00:30:03.302 --> 00:30:06.639
Negative. Looks like they blew out
of there before we arrived.

391
00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.140
We need an exfil.

392
00:30:09.225 --> 00:30:11.143
We had a UAV up over their base.

393
00:30:11.185 --> 00:30:13.687
and tracked three vehicles
leaving 10 minutes ago.

394
00:30:13.729 --> 00:30:15.481
One of them was kicking out
enough neutrons

395
00:30:15.523 --> 00:30:17.399
to light up
like an electric lightbulb.

396
00:30:17.441 --> 00:30:19.527
Assume Rodin is with the bomb.

397
00:30:19.818 --> 00:30:21.904
You'll be heading for Ngorny Stasi.

398
00:30:21.946 --> 00:30:24.240
It's an army base about
10 miles to your west.

399
00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:25.991
Sir. we need a way out.

400
00:30:26.909 --> 00:30:29.703
You and the remaining members
of your team are all we have there.

401
00:30:29.912 --> 00:30:31.372
General. these men are tired.

402
00:30:31.413 --> 00:30:34.250
They lost their leader. friends...
We're low on ammo.

403
00:30:34.291 --> 00:30:36.794
God damn it. John.
when that bomb's gone. it's gone.

404
00:30:36.835 --> 00:30:37.836
Imagine they roll that truck

405
00:30:37.878 --> 00:30:40.172
into Paris. Berlin.
or Moscow and set it off.

406
00:30:40.214 --> 00:30:41.382
I don't know what you gotta do.

407
00:30:41.423 --> 00:30:43.008
I don't know where you're gonna
have to go to find it.

408
00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:44.093
but you've got to dig deep

409
00:30:44.134 --> 00:30:46.637
and find whatever it is you've lost
and finish this.

410
00:30:48.222 --> 00:30:50.224
Otherwise two good men
died for nothing

411
00:30:50.266 --> 00:30:51.684
and a hell of a lot more will follow.

412
00:30:54.937 --> 00:30:56.313
(Sighs)

413
00:30:57.064 --> 00:30:59.275
-John?
-I know what Chief would say.

414
00:31:00.734 --> 00:31:02.444
He promised to get you guys home.

415
00:31:02.486 --> 00:31:04.363
There are some promises
no one can keep.

416
00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:07.700
We're SEALs. John.

417
00:31:07.741 --> 00:31:10.077
We finish the fucking mission.
no matter what.

418
00:31:10.119 --> 00:31:11.287
(Anderson) John. are you there?

419
00:31:15.499 --> 00:31:17.334
Send us the data you have.

420
00:31:17.918 --> 00:31:19.920
We stop this bastard for you. sir.

421
00:31:21.338 --> 00:31:23.424
(Dog barking)

422
00:31:53.037 --> 00:31:54.038
(Pinky) Is that our truck?

423
00:31:54.622 --> 00:31:56.332
Won't know until we look inside.

424
00:31:59.251 --> 00:32:03.047
-So what's the plan?
-We do it loud.

425
00:32:03.547 --> 00:32:04.965
There's only five of us.

426
00:32:05.007 --> 00:32:07.760
Yeah. they don't know that.
We hit 'em so hard and so fast.

427
00:32:07.801 --> 00:32:10.888
they'll think there's a whole
motherfucking division out here.

428
00:32:10.929 --> 00:32:12.431
You know. I like this guy.

429
00:32:12.931 --> 00:32:14.933
To think I almost stabbed him
a few hours ago.

430
00:32:14.975 --> 00:32:17.186
He almost kicked your ass
a few hours ago.

431
00:32:17.603 --> 00:32:19.813
-Can the grab ass.
-All right.

432
00:32:19.855 --> 00:32:22.274
Pinky. Nick.
I want you guys on Alpha team.

433
00:32:22.316 --> 00:32:23.692
Take a look inside the truck.

434
00:32:23.734 --> 00:32:26.320
Coop. you're on Bravo team.
all by your lonesome.

435
00:32:26.362 --> 00:32:27.404
I want you on the long gun.

436
00:32:27.446 --> 00:32:30.074
When the shit hits the fan.
secure the truck. we move out.

437
00:32:30.115 --> 00:32:31.742
Frank. you're with me
on Charlie team.

438
00:32:31.784 --> 00:32:34.244
We'll hit the main building.
we'll do a quick intel sweep.

439
00:32:34.286 --> 00:32:35.496
Good to go?

440
00:32:35.537 --> 00:32:36.705
-(Coop) Boo-ya.
-(Pinky) Let's go.

441
00:32:36.747 --> 00:32:38.540
-Lock and load.
-(Guns cocking)

442
00:32:56.225 --> 00:32:57.810
(Grunting)

443
00:32:59.812 --> 00:33:02.064
The convoy. Where'd they go?

444
00:33:02.106 --> 00:33:05.192
I don't know. OK. OK!

445
00:33:05.234 --> 00:33:09.113
They never stop here.
They went straight to Golyama.

446
00:33:09.154 --> 00:33:11.281
-What's this?
-Train station.

447
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:13.283
(Grunts)

448
00:33:20.249 --> 00:33:21.291
(Groans)

449
00:33:27.506 --> 00:33:28.716
(Shouting)

450
00:34:00.706 --> 00:34:01.874
(Grunts)

451
00:34:12.342 --> 00:34:15.429
(Indistinct shouting)

452
00:34:50.881 --> 00:34:52.090
Get in!

453
00:34:55.594 --> 00:34:57.596
(Groans)

454
00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:02.017
John. get in!

455
00:35:22.162 --> 00:35:25.582
-Pinky! You good to drive?
-Yeah!

456
00:35:26.792 --> 00:35:28.710
Stay on this road.
I know where they're going.

457
00:35:28.752 --> 00:35:29.753
How?

458
00:35:30.504 --> 00:35:32.464
Golyama train station.

459
00:35:32.506 --> 00:35:34.383
-Five miles north of here.
-Call it in.

460
00:35:43.559 --> 00:35:47.020
Fuck. You're one lucky bastard.
you know that?

461
00:35:53.819 --> 00:35:55.028
(Indistinct chatter)

462
00:36:05.622 --> 00:36:08.000
Careful. careful. Yes.

463
00:36:14.381 --> 00:36:16.800
You have one hour to finish the bomb.

464
00:36:18.468 --> 00:36:20.304
What guarantee do we have

465
00:36:20.345 --> 00:36:23.015
that you will not shoot us
like you did Yuri?

466
00:36:23.849 --> 00:36:25.684
None. Just my word.

467
00:36:26.184 --> 00:36:27.978
I gain nothing by your death.

468
00:36:28.729 --> 00:36:31.565
The Americans already know
I have the weapon.

469
00:36:31.607 --> 00:36:33.734
Now. it's just a game of time.

470
00:36:34.026 --> 00:36:35.402
One hour.

471
00:36:38.196 --> 00:36:39.531
(Door closes)

472
00:36:40.407 --> 00:36:42.326
What other choice do we have?

473
00:36:43.869 --> 00:36:45.078
Let's work.

474
00:36:47.247 --> 00:36:49.333
(Machine beeping)

475
00:36:58.008 --> 00:36:59.259
(John) Stop!

476
00:37:00.093 --> 00:37:01.219
Yo!

477
00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:04.348
Hey. where're you going?

478
00:37:07.309 --> 00:37:10.270
Coop. I want you and the others
to take this road southwest.

479
00:37:10.896 --> 00:37:12.397
You'll run into a small
fishing village.

480
00:37:12.439 --> 00:37:14.858
Steal a boat. you'll be in Italian
waters by nightfall.

481
00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:17.110
You're gonna take
on those guys on your own?

482
00:37:17.152 --> 00:37:19.321
-Just one.
-We're coming with you.

483
00:37:19.363 --> 00:37:22.741
Pink. you're good. But one arm.
you ain't good to me.

484
00:37:22.783 --> 00:37:24.076
I can still put out.

485
00:37:24.451 --> 00:37:27.412
Who's gonna get Nick home
if Pink's only got one good arm?

486
00:37:27.454 --> 00:37:28.580
That's an order.

487
00:37:29.081 --> 00:37:31.833
Hey. man. if I can't stop him. someone
has to let General Anderson know

488
00:37:31.875 --> 00:37:33.335
the bomb is on that train.

489
00:37:33.835 --> 00:37:36.380
12 hours from now. that train
could be in the heart of Europe.

490
00:37:36.421 --> 00:37:38.131
Germany. Austria. Russia.

491
00:37:38.423 --> 00:37:40.676
Letting that train go free
is like putting a virus

492
00:37:40.717 --> 00:37:42.427
directly in the bloodstream
of the continent.

493
00:37:42.469 --> 00:37:43.679
Anderson will know what to do.

494
00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.639
-Go.
-Good luck.

495
00:37:46.598 --> 00:37:48.558
-Hey. Coop?
-Yeah?

496
00:37:49.059 --> 00:37:50.560
If I fuck this up.

497
00:37:50.978 --> 00:37:52.729
I want you to go to NOLA for me.

498
00:37:53.271 --> 00:37:55.983
There's a joint there.
it's called Coach and Horses.

499
00:37:57.567 --> 00:38:00.570
There's a bartender. Can't miss her.

500
00:38:01.196 --> 00:38:03.657
Eyes even one of you
frogmen could drown in.

501
00:38:04.574 --> 00:38:06.785
She's got Spud. Her name's Jenna.

502
00:38:06.827 --> 00:38:08.578
Listen. man. you'll be taking care
of that yourself.

503
00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:09.746
And if I can't?

504
00:38:14.126 --> 00:38:16.086
We've been thinking about
getting a dog ourselves.

505
00:38:17.337 --> 00:38:18.422
He'll have a good home.

506
00:38:23.176 --> 00:38:25.053
-(Taps truck)
-Go!

507
00:38:45.323 --> 00:38:46.366

-Where have you been?
-Looking at the train.

533
00:41:01.543 --> 00:41:03.670
(Chuckles) You're lucky
you didn't miss it.

534
00:41:03.712 --> 00:41:06.756
Papa. there's lots of soldiers
on this train and they have guns.

535
00:41:08.216 --> 00:41:11.219
Right. Now... sit down.

536
00:41:12.679 --> 00:41:14.681
We have a long trip.

537
00:41:27.777 --> 00:41:29.946
-Get ready to move.
-Where to?

538
00:41:30.238 --> 00:41:31.281
North.

539
00:41:31.323 --> 00:41:33.200
No way. we are not clear
to go north.

540
00:41:35.202 --> 00:41:36.828
Are we clear now?

541
00:41:38.288 --> 00:41:39.331
(Man) Go.

542
00:41:41.208 --> 00:41:43.293
(Train horn blowing)

543
00:41:48.298 --> 00:41:51.593
-Papa. Papa. we're moving.
-(Chuckles)

544
00:42:14.241 --> 00:42:17.452
-He has a gun.
-Son. you need to be quiet.

545
00:42:19.454 --> 00:42:21.581
(All screaming)

546
00:42:21.873 --> 00:42:23.959
(Laughing) Nice try.

547
00:42:26.753 --> 00:42:29.881
Good afternoon. everybody.
Welcome on board Train 290

548
00:42:29.923 --> 00:42:32.342
with non-stop service to hell.

549
00:42:33.134 --> 00:42:36.137
For the duration of our travel.
I will be your host.

550
00:42:36.554 --> 00:42:38.640
My name is none of your business.

551
00:42:39.266 --> 00:42:41.351
And in case of an emergency...

552
00:42:41.893 --> 00:42:43.895
all of you will probably die.

553
00:42:44.854 --> 00:42:47.941
Please. sir.
We are peaceful people. We are...

554
00:42:48.692 --> 00:42:51.653
You serve a single function.

555
00:42:51.695 --> 00:42:55.907
All of you will act like
shields to protect me.

556
00:42:56.992 --> 00:43:01.830
Your lives mean as little to me
as that of insects.

557
00:43:02.998 --> 00:43:07.544
If you wish to get off of this train.
you will be obedient.

558
00:43:07.585 --> 00:43:12.924
you will be silent! Believe in me
as padre here believes in God.

559
00:43:13.258 --> 00:43:15.760
You can survive with this. and now...

560
00:43:16.761 --> 00:43:18.221
the choice is yours.

561
00:43:25.645 --> 00:43:27.439
Clean this up. will you?

562
00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:37.949
(♪ Music playing)

563
00:43:53.423 --> 00:43:55.175
It's a bit early to celebrate.
isn't it?

564
00:43:55.216 --> 00:43:56.259
(Chuckles)

565
00:43:56.301 --> 00:43:58.428
I'm drinking champagne for pleasure.

566
00:43:58.762 --> 00:44:00.638
Not for some special occasion.

567
00:44:09.481 --> 00:44:12.442
Jamal! It's your friend. Igor.

568
00:44:13.026 --> 00:44:14.527
Yes. we are on the way.

569
00:44:16.112 --> 00:44:18.239
I received the deposit
and now you need

570
00:44:18.281 --> 00:44:21.701
to escrow the remainder of the fee
with our friends from Switzerland.

571
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:25.580
Of course the device is ready.

572
00:44:25.955 --> 00:44:28.666
It will perform
precisely as demonstrated.

573
00:44:28.708 --> 00:44:30.668
If not. keep away
your $100 million.

574
00:44:32.545 --> 00:44:33.588
Bye.

575
00:44:38.802 --> 00:44:39.803
Zivko!

576
00:44:40.595 --> 00:44:44.057
I want to know the second
the money hits the escrow account.

577
00:45:25.181 --> 00:45:29.185
Nikola... for Christ's sakes.
what is wrong?

578
00:45:29.227 --> 00:45:30.854
There is a long way to go
and you're here

579
00:45:30.895 --> 00:45:32.522
playing romantic-man with this girl.

580
00:45:32.564 --> 00:45:36.985
There are no more moves.
No more decisions to make.

581
00:45:37.026 --> 00:45:40.697
If we have made our plans well.
then we will succeed.

582
00:45:40.738 --> 00:45:45.785
If no. we will fail.
and nothing can change that now.

583
00:45:57.422 --> 00:46:01.176
Nina. check if the solenoid
on 14 is connected.

584
00:46:01.551 --> 00:46:03.261
-It's fine.
-No. it's not.

585
00:46:03.303 --> 00:46:04.762
I'm not getting the signal.

586
00:46:05.805 --> 00:46:08.892
Gregor. it is connected.
Come see for yourself.

587
00:46:14.439 --> 00:46:16.149
(Softly) I'm disconnecting
the container

588
00:46:16.191 --> 00:46:18.276
from the pressure valves to the fuel.

589
00:46:19.652 --> 00:46:21.654
But that will disable the bomb.

590
00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:23.281
Precisely.

591
00:46:25.283 --> 00:46:26.784
He will kill us.

592
00:46:27.452 --> 00:46:31.414
He's going to do that anyway.
I won't let him get away with this.

593
00:46:32.415 --> 00:46:35.043
Nina. please. Don't do this.

594
00:46:35.293 --> 00:46:37.045
-I have a family.
-Back to work!

595
00:46:37.086 --> 00:46:38.796
-He's going to...
-Guard!

596
00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:42.550
-Stop her.
-Coward.

597
00:46:50.308 --> 00:46:51.392
Hey!

598
00:46:52.894 --> 00:46:57.649
Oh! Hold on. hold on.
I got my ticket. all right? It's...

599
00:47:04.239 --> 00:47:05.907
Call me Igor. please.

600
00:47:11.287 --> 00:47:12.288
What?

601
00:47:13.331 --> 00:47:14.624
(Nikola) Explain.

602
00:47:16.125 --> 00:47:20.338
She has disconnected the firing
circuits to the valve-solenoids.

603
00:47:24.425 --> 00:47:25.843
What does it mean?

604
00:47:28.054 --> 00:47:29.222
Sabotage.

605
00:47:47.323 --> 00:47:48.700
Can you fix it?

606
00:47:50.159 --> 00:47:52.579
-I believe so.
-Asshole.

607
00:47:53.913 --> 00:47:54.998
(Nina grunts)

608
00:48:00.795 --> 00:48:02.130
You believe?

609
00:48:03.506 --> 00:48:07.385
For one million dollars.
I could be certain.

610
00:48:07.427 --> 00:48:10.763
-One?
-Da. one.

611
00:48:11.556 --> 00:48:15.685
One million dollars in a
Swiss account with your name on it.

612
00:48:16.561 --> 00:48:17.979
Can be done.

613
00:48:18.730 --> 00:48:22.650
-How long do you need?
-Forty-five minutes. no more.

614
00:48:22.692 --> 00:48:24.736
Go. Get it right.

615
00:48:25.486 --> 00:48:29.240
Nikola. go with him and protect him.
like he is your son.

616
00:48:29.282 --> 00:48:30.366
OK.

617
00:48:36.164 --> 00:48:39.292
Sir. I'm in.
I'm gonna shut down the system.

618
00:48:42.503 --> 00:48:43.755
(Yelps)

619
00:49:03.149 --> 00:49:04.233
(Train horn blowing)

620
00:49:11.157 --> 00:49:13.576
Make any sound
and I will end your life.

621
00:49:16.412 --> 00:49:18.998
-You speak English?
-I do.

622
00:49:21.417 --> 00:49:24.420
-Who are you?
-I'm asking the questions.

623
00:49:25.129 --> 00:49:28.966
-What are you doing here?
-I'm the conductor. Vesslin.

624
00:49:31.886 --> 00:49:33.346
How many of them are on board?

625
00:49:33.846 --> 00:49:34.889
(Sighs)

626
00:49:36.683 --> 00:49:39.435
-Thank God you're not with them.
-How many?

627
00:49:39.727 --> 00:49:43.606
Erm. they're around 20 of them.

628
00:49:43.856 --> 00:49:46.609
I'm not sure what is happening
in the two front carriages.

629
00:49:46.651 --> 00:49:48.820
-They won't let me in.
-I need a phone.

630
00:49:48.861 --> 00:49:52.281
Cell phones don't work here.
Not for the next 300 kilometres.

631
00:49:52.323 --> 00:49:54.117
What about for emergencies?

632
00:49:54.158 --> 00:49:55.535
You can use mine.

633
00:49:57.578 --> 00:50:00.164
But it's connected only
to the dispatcher's office.

634
00:50:00.415 --> 00:50:01.791
Then put me on it.

635
00:50:07.046 --> 00:50:08.631
(Phone ringing)

636
00:50:09.257 --> 00:50:10.675
(Snores)

637
00:50:17.932 --> 00:50:19.267
-(Phone ringing)
-(Groans)

638
00:50:24.605 --> 00:50:25.606
Control.

639
00:50:26.357 --> 00:50:29.986
-Who's this?
-This is control agent Boris Tamesh.

640
00:50:30.027 --> 00:50:33.781
43794...
Hey! Who the hell is this?

641
00:50:33.823 --> 00:50:36.325
John Cutter. I'm on Train 290.

642
00:50:36.367 --> 00:50:39.078
I need you to contact NATO
headquarters in Brussels.

643
00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:41.748
have them connect you
to US Army in Taranto. Italy.

644
00:50:42.039 --> 00:50:44.459
Authorisation code is
Kilo-Tango-Charlie 9-7...

645
00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:45.918
Uh...

646
00:50:46.335 --> 00:50:47.420
(Mumbles)

647
00:50:48.045 --> 00:50:49.464
Are you fucking deaf?

648
00:50:49.505 --> 00:50:52.216
No. I'm looking
for the correct regulation

649
00:50:52.258 --> 00:50:55.803
regarding unauthorisation
use of the phone system.

650
00:50:55.845 --> 00:50:57.305
How about regulations for a bomb?

651
00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:06.773
Boris. do as he says.
Bandits took over my train.

652
00:51:07.732 --> 00:51:09.275
(Boris) Vesslin. is that you?

653
00:51:16.365 --> 00:51:18.242
This person should not use our phone.

654
00:51:18.284 --> 00:51:20.286
Hey. listen. asshole. All right?
There's a bomb

655
00:51:20.328 --> 00:51:22.330
the size of a fucking minivan
on this train.

656
00:51:22.371 --> 00:51:25.833
Tell me again.
what was your name. please?

657
00:51:25.875 --> 00:51:29.003
Lieutenant John Cutter.
Ask for General Norman Anderson.

658
00:51:29.337 --> 00:51:32.256
-And you want me to call NATO?
-Da.

659
00:51:32.715 --> 00:51:33.758
Shit.

660
00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:35.259
Are you gonna do it or what?

661
00:51:35.301 --> 00:51:37.678
Yes. I will.
But first I have to find...

662
00:51:40.223 --> 00:51:41.599
Line went dead.

663
00:51:42.099 --> 00:51:45.394
Not good. Someone heard us.

664
00:51:45.436 --> 00:51:48.606
-Is there another phone?
-Yes. In my office.

665
00:51:48.648 --> 00:51:50.817
Get back there
before they notice you're gone.

666
00:51:56.030 --> 00:52:00.618
Operator? Yes. please connect me
with NATO headquarter in Brussels.

667
00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:02.328
It is an emergency call.

668
00:52:12.171 --> 00:52:14.757
-Mister?
-Whoa. hey.

669
00:52:14.799 --> 00:52:17.343
Is there truly a bomb on this train?

670
00:52:17.635 --> 00:52:20.513
I think so.
How did you know about that?

671
00:52:20.847 --> 00:52:24.308
I heard the big. ugly man
talking about a bomb.

672
00:52:24.892 --> 00:52:27.186
Too many of those ugly.
big men on this train?

673
00:52:27.228 --> 00:52:29.647
Mister. are you one of the bad guys?

674
00:52:29.689 --> 00:52:32.441
No. kid. Do I look like a bad guy?

675
00:52:36.612 --> 00:52:38.155
-Here.
-Is this for me?

676
00:52:38.197 --> 00:52:40.074
This drawing is for you.

677
00:52:40.491 --> 00:52:44.078
That's where the soldiers are.
and the barrels.

678
00:52:44.453 --> 00:52:47.582
That's the one the big man
and his friends are in.

679
00:52:48.499 --> 00:52:51.711
Here. I don't know.
Some kind of yellow barrel.

680
00:52:53.838 --> 00:52:55.715
Thank you. Thank you.

681
00:53:00.344 --> 00:53:01.345
Mr Rodin.

682
00:53:01.929 --> 00:53:05.016
Sir. we have a problem
with one of the passengers.

683
00:53:05.057 --> 00:53:07.059
American or English. I can't tell.

684
00:53:08.644 --> 00:53:10.021
You're going to fail.

685
00:53:12.815 --> 00:53:15.776
On the line to the main office.
he told them about the bomb.

686
00:53:15.818 --> 00:53:18.237
-Bastard.
-I disconnected the line. sir. but...

687
00:53:22.033 --> 00:53:23.200
(Gun cocks)

688
00:53:25.703 --> 00:53:26.913
(Igor) Watch her!

689
00:53:34.337 --> 00:53:37.089
Follow me.
Doctor. if you want to live

690
00:53:37.131 --> 00:53:40.468
to see that money.

691
00:53:58.069 --> 00:54:00.655
-(Phone rings)
-Control.

692
00:54:00.696 --> 00:54:03.199
-Boris. did you make the call?
-Yeah. I made.

693
00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:04.367
And?

694
00:54:04.408 --> 00:54:08.412
And they told me to please wait
and they'll call back to verify.

695
00:54:08.454 --> 00:54:10.748
-Did you tell them about the bomb?
-I did.

696
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:13.417
-And?
-And they will call me back...

697
00:54:13.459 --> 00:54:16.087
Boris. you need to yell and scream
until they hear you.

698
00:54:16.128 --> 00:54:18.464
A lot of people are going to die
unless that message gets through.

699
00:54:18.506 --> 00:54:19.674
Do you understand?

700
00:54:34.897 --> 00:54:36.023
How can I help you?

701
00:54:36.774 --> 00:54:38.275
American. Where is he?

702
00:54:39.610 --> 00:54:41.862
No. sir. No American here.

703
00:54:42.655 --> 00:54:45.700
-You let him use the phone.
-(Grunts)

704
00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:47.284
(Passengers whimpering)

705
00:54:49.787 --> 00:54:51.288
No one here.

706
00:54:52.373 --> 00:54:54.959
He was a foreign provocateur.
you fool.

707
00:54:55.001 --> 00:54:56.168
Give me the PA.

708
00:54:59.672 --> 00:55:00.965
American!

709
00:55:01.632 --> 00:55:03.050
Are you listening?

710
00:55:03.634 --> 00:55:05.302
You will surrender yourself
to me at once.

711
00:55:05.553 --> 00:55:08.681
If not.
I will start killing passengers.

712
00:55:08.723 --> 00:55:13.144
one at a time.
each fucking minute. until you do.

713
00:55:15.021 --> 00:55:16.439
(Gun cocks)

714
00:55:30.661 --> 00:55:32.496
(Woman whimpering)

715
00:55:34.123 --> 00:55:35.541
(Boy crying)

716
00:55:49.555 --> 00:55:51.849
-You're the scientist.
-You're the American?

717
00:55:52.099 --> 00:55:53.601
I suppose so.

718
00:55:53.642 --> 00:55:55.770
They're looking for you.
They want to kill you.

719
00:55:56.645 --> 00:55:59.106
You cannot surrender.
You are all we have.

720
00:56:00.024 --> 00:56:03.360
It's OK.
I have no plans of giving up.

721
00:56:04.361 --> 00:56:06.822
Good. You don't have much time.

722
00:56:06.864 --> 00:56:09.075
-Is the bomb finished?
-Soon.

723
00:56:09.116 --> 00:56:11.702
-How long do I have?
-Maybe 15 minutes.

724
00:56:14.455 --> 00:56:17.208
Drop it. or the kid dies.

725
00:56:36.852 --> 00:56:39.063

726

(John coughs)

727
00:56:43.901 --> 00:56:45.236
Who are you?

728
00:56:46.028 --> 00:56:47.404
Mother Teresa.

729
00:56:48.739 --> 00:56:50.116
Mother Teresa?

730
00:56:53.327 --> 00:56:55.704
-(Grunts)
-(Igor) Nikola.

731
00:56:55.746 --> 00:56:57.081
(Groans)

732
00:56:59.125 --> 00:57:01.794
Let me see what we have here.
Who is he?

733
00:57:01.836 --> 00:57:03.796
He said he's Mother Teresa.

734
00:57:06.215 --> 00:57:07.466
What an idiot.

735
00:57:17.434 --> 00:57:18.727
(Speaking Russian)

736
00:57:19.353 --> 00:57:20.479
I know him.

737
00:57:20.938 --> 00:57:23.357
It's always nice to know
that you're remembered.

738
00:57:24.441 --> 00:57:26.986
Your pride cost me
too much money that day.

739
00:57:28.362 --> 00:57:30.739
Your greed cost me
the lives of my troopers.

740
00:57:31.907 --> 00:57:33.909
-He is an American.
-American?

741
00:57:33.951 --> 00:57:36.912
Lieutenant John Cutter. right?

742
00:57:36.954 --> 00:57:40.708
We met in Africa. We met in Africa.

743
00:57:42.126 --> 00:57:43.878
How did the CIA find me?

744
00:57:45.671 --> 00:57:48.674
-Maybe the Yellow Pages?
-(Grunts)

745
00:57:49.383 --> 00:57:50.467
You're right.

746
00:57:50.885 --> 00:57:53.929
-That was a total lie.
-What are you doing here?

747
00:57:53.971 --> 00:57:57.433
I'm here to ID you and your
fucking bomb for a strike team.

748
00:57:57.474 --> 00:58:00.227
-You're bluffing.
-Try me.

749
00:58:00.978 --> 00:58:02.688
I already planted the GPS.

750
00:58:06.692 --> 00:58:08.485
Yeah. you're right.

751
00:58:08.903 --> 00:58:10.613
I'm gonna kill you right now.

752
00:58:10.988 --> 00:58:12.448
You can't kill me. asshole.

753
00:58:12.489 --> 00:58:13.824
I'm the only one who knows
where it is.

754
00:58:14.325 --> 00:58:15.910
Come to think of it.

755
00:58:16.619 --> 00:58:18.829
the birds should already
be on their way.

756
00:58:19.330 --> 00:58:21.290
(Man on radio)
Rodin. you need to see this.

757
00:58:21.957 --> 00:58:24.960
Hold on. I will be there in a minute.

758
00:58:26.795 --> 00:58:28.422

Yes. yes! (Laughing)

761
00:59:02.289 --> 00:59:03.290
Come on. come on. come on.

762
00:59:07.878 --> 00:59:10.631
This is Legion One. on an unsecured
emergency frequency

763
00:59:10.673 --> 00:59:12.549

military forces within range. over.

764
00:59:12.883 --> 00:59:14.385
Legion One. this is submarine...

765
00:59:14.426 --> 00:59:15.928
Listen. I need
General Anderson. fast!

766
00:59:15.970 --> 00:59:17.179
Sir. this is a non-secure frequency.

767
00:59:17.221 --> 00:59:19.515
Put it in your report.
Go for Anderson.

768
00:59:19.556 --> 00:59:20.766
General. this is Coop.

769
00:59:20.808 --> 00:59:23.560
The device and the target are on

771

Train 290
out of Golyama. 1400. copy.

772
00:59:28.732 --> 00:59:30.359
I have one critically wounded sailor.

773
00:59:30.401 --> 00:59:33.112
and one with a GSW. non-critical.
Need emergency pickup.

774
00:59:33.153 --> 00:59:34.196
Where's Cutter?

775
00:59:34.238 --> 00:59:37.032
Cutter's on the train. sir.
He wanted to finish the mission.

776
00:59:37.074 --> 00:59:39.743
We're coming to get you. Cooper.
Hang tight.

777
00:59:40.119 --> 00:59:42.621
Get me NATO. I need an immediate
strike readied.

778
00:59:42.663 --> 00:59:45.082
We need two interceptors
for Train 290.

779
00:59:45.124 --> 00:59:48.002
-But. sir. Cutter's still on board...
-And so is that bomb.

780
00:59:49.044 --> 00:59:51.505
Switch our tracks over
at the next intersection.

781
00:59:52.631 --> 00:59:54.967
Sir. that's extremely dangerous.

782
00:59:55.009 --> 00:59:56.927
We've just shut down
the entire system.

783
00:59:57.219 --> 00:59:59.638
It's a single track railroad.

784
00:59:59.888 --> 01:00:02.975
What's coming the other way
could be 10.000 tonnes of steel.

785
01:00:03.017 --> 01:00:06.228
Exactly. Or. 1.000 pounds
of high explosive.

(John wheezing)

797
01:01:09.458 --> 01:01:10.667
Tell us!

798
01:01:11.210 --> 01:01:13.670
Tell us. you American piece of shit.

799
01:01:16.465 --> 01:01:17.549
You tell us!

800
01:01:18.801 --> 01:01:20.177
(John) Why did I leave her?

801
01:01:21.136 --> 01:01:23.514
She said I cared more about my unit.

802
01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:29.061

She was right!

I don't know. sir.

809
01:02:25.325 --> 01:02:28.120
The truck was diverted
to an outside command

810
01:02:28.162 --> 01:02:30.706
-and then the system crashed.
-Can you contact them?

811
01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:34.918
Negative. sir. I tried. but it is
an old train and no one answers.

812
01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.879
What about 290?

813
01:02:37.129 --> 01:02:40.215
I don't know. They don't receive.
I think the signal is cut.

814
01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:43.343
Call the army. see if someone
can get a helicopter

815
01:02:43.385 --> 01:02:44.511

816
01:02:44.553 --> 01:02:47.097
Sir. I don't think it's a good idea.

817
01:02:47.139 --> 01:02:49.766
because there is a bomb on the train.

818

You're going to get a medal.

Da. if I live.

841
01:06:19.434 --> 01:06:20.727

-Did you reach General Anderson?

Not yet. John. you are on
a collision course with another train.

847
01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.961
-How long do we have?
-About eight minutes.

848
01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:48.588
All right. I need you
to contact General Anderson

849
01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:50.006
through the codes I gave you.

850
01:06:50.048 --> 01:06:52.342
Tell him the bomb is on this train.
Do you understand?

851
01:06:56.555 --> 01:06:58.140
We're on a collision course
with another train.

852

How do we do it?

853

-I can show you how to do it.
-Good.

(Over phone)
This is General Anderson.

866
01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:46.373
It's for you. NATO headquarters.

867
01:08:46.665 --> 01:08:49.042
It's about time. (Clears throat)

868
01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:51.253
Sir. yes. sir.

869
01:08:51.878 --> 01:08:54.631
Boris. this is General Anderson.

870
01:08:54.673 --> 01:08:56.508
Yes. Captain Tamesh. sir.

871
01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:58.969
I have a message for you
from John Cutter.

872
01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:01.429
The bomb and the target
are on the train.

873
01:09:01.471 --> 01:09:05.934
I know that. Captain.
The question is. where is the train?

874
01:09:06.726 --> 01:09:08.103
The train diverted west.

875
01:09:08.144 --> 01:09:11.565
It's approximately 10 kilometres
from border with Montenegro.

876
01:09:11.606 --> 01:09:12.941
Approximately?

877
01:09:12.983 --> 01:09:15.569
Our command controls
are malfunctioning.

878
01:09:15.944 --> 01:09:16.987
Jesus.

879
01:09:17.028 --> 01:09:19.406
And. sir. another thing.
Very important.

880
01:09:19.447 --> 01:09:24.369
The Train 290 is on a collision course
with another train.

881
01:09:24.411 --> 01:09:26.121
Steam train from Croatia.

882
01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:27.414
Thank you. Captain.

883
01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:31.251
Find me that goddamn train.

884
01:09:53.607 --> 01:09:56.192
-Hey!
-Sorry. I didn't make an appointment.

885
01:09:56.234 --> 01:09:57.652
What the hell is it with you?

886
01:09:57.694 --> 01:10:00.322
A personal crusade to stop me
making any money?

887
01:10:01.615 --> 01:10:03.491
Maybe you should
find a new profession.

888
01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:06.077
Murder and kidnapping don't seem
to be working out too well.

889
01:10:06.119 --> 01:10:08.788
Easy for you to say.
You're a young man.

890
01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:13.126
You know how hard it is
to change careers in middle age?

891
01:10:15.879 --> 01:10:19.215
Tell me. What do you want from me?

892
01:10:19.591 --> 01:10:20.967
I want you to die.

893
01:10:23.887 --> 01:10:25.430
(Shouts)

894
01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:33.647
Listen!

895
01:10:34.439 --> 01:10:39.152
Once the bomb is delivered.
I make $100 million.

896
01:10:39.527 --> 01:10:41.029
Just name your price.

897
01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:44.491
How about half?

898
01:10:45.992 --> 01:10:47.911
That's a fuck load of money.

899
01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:50.580
Are you offering me a partnership?

900
01:10:50.997 --> 01:10:54.834
Oh. no. man. I already have partners.
You know them.

901
01:10:55.835 --> 01:10:58.880
It's Uncle Sam. CIA.

902
01:10:59.381 --> 01:11:01.424
Norman E. Anderson.

903
01:11:02.133 --> 01:11:03.677
"E" stands for Elliot.

904
01:11:04.678 --> 01:11:05.971
What are you talking about?

905
01:11:06.846 --> 01:11:10.100
Lieutenant. we are working
for the same people.

906
01:11:10.141 --> 01:11:13.979
The only difference is.
I'm making much more money.

907
01:11:22.779 --> 01:11:24.072
-Hold on!
-(Gun clicks)

908
01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:36.251
I think we got
a little stand-off here.

909
01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:37.752
No one has to die.

910
01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:41.297
One month ago.
I had a contract with CIA.

911
01:11:41.339 --> 01:11:43.216
They highjacked the scientists.

912
01:11:43.633 --> 01:11:46.970
but later. some whistleblower
opened his mouth

913
01:11:47.012 --> 01:11:50.306
and now the US government
wants to shut me down forever.

914
01:11:50.765 --> 01:11:53.309
I need an insurance policy...
the bomb.

915
01:11:54.227 --> 01:11:57.647
No one will fuck me up
when this toy is ready.

916
01:11:58.023 --> 01:11:59.941
US government doesn't deal
with terrorists.

917
01:11:59.983 --> 01:12:02.444
(Chuckles) Come on. man.

918
01:12:02.485 --> 01:12:05.655
All the criminals and terrorists
all over the world

919
01:12:05.697 --> 01:12:07.782
has had a business with CIA.

920
01:12:08.616 --> 01:12:12.454
On Monday. they need us.
On Tuesday. they train us.

921
01:12:12.787 --> 01:12:14.581
On Wednesday they use us.

922
01:12:14.873 --> 01:12:17.208
By Friday. we are terrorists again.

923
01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:20.670
-We are all from the same school!
-I don't care.

924
01:12:23.048 --> 01:12:25.467
(Both grunting)

925
01:12:36.644 --> 01:12:38.480
(Igor) He's using us both.

926
01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:41.441
(Grunting continues)

927
01:12:49.949 --> 01:12:52.035
(Yelling)

928
01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:04.923
(Choking)

929
01:13:06.299 --> 01:13:07.425
(Groaning)

930
01:13:16.101 --> 01:13:17.435
(Yelling)

931
01:13:26.653 --> 01:13:28.696
We still can make a deal.

932
01:13:28.988 --> 01:13:31.741
Here's the deal... you die.

933
01:13:32.408 --> 01:13:34.410
I came here to make the world safer.

934
01:13:34.452 --> 01:13:36.746
but now I'm here for... Frank!

935
01:13:37.705 --> 01:13:40.166
Russ. Dan.

936
01:13:40.792 --> 01:13:43.294
-and Chief!
-(Gunshot)

937
01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:46.965
(Breathes heavily)

938
01:13:52.303 --> 01:13:53.513
(Screams)

939
01:14:00.854 --> 01:14:02.730
(Man on radio)
All units. take positions.

940
01:14:14.909 --> 01:14:16.452
Welcome home. Cooper.

941
01:14:16.494 --> 01:14:20.415
-You heard from Mr Cutter. sir?
-Not yet. I hope he makes it.

942
01:14:20.456 --> 01:14:22.834
Looks like there's going to be
a collision with the other train

943
01:14:22.876 --> 01:14:25.420
and I don't think there's a damn thing
we can do about it.

944
01:14:25.461 --> 01:14:26.462
We have to do something.

945
01:14:29.174 --> 01:14:30.383
I'm trying. son.

946
01:14:32.177 --> 01:14:34.137
That man saved our asses back there.

947
01:14:35.597 --> 01:14:38.808
So with all due respect. try harder.

948
01:14:42.478 --> 01:14:43.897
Stand down. sailor.

949
01:14:55.033 --> 01:14:56.492
(John panting)

950
01:14:57.285 --> 01:14:58.870
Can you disarm the bomb?

951
01:14:58.912 --> 01:15:01.331
No. not if Gregor finished it.

952
01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:07.545
(Train horn blows)

953
01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:13.968
Focus on the bomb. Nina.

954
01:15:20.767 --> 01:15:22.852
Gregor has installed three triggers.

955
01:15:22.894 --> 01:15:25.563
The timer. a remote detonator.
accelerator.

956
01:15:25.605 --> 01:15:26.731
What's that?

957
01:15:26.773 --> 01:15:29.609
-If the bomb is moved too fast...
-Like if the trains crashes?

958
01:15:29.651 --> 01:15:31.736
We are all going to die if we crash.

959
01:15:31.778 --> 01:15:36.783
We all die if I tamper the device
or interrupt the circuits.

960
01:15:37.909 --> 01:15:39.702
-Unless...
-Unless?

961
01:15:40.328 --> 01:15:43.039
I can depressurise the oxygen tanks.

962
01:15:43.623 --> 01:15:46.751
That will slow down
the main frame meltdown.

963
01:15:46.793 --> 01:15:50.004
And if I'm right. it will help
to switch off the entire system.

964
01:15:50.046 --> 01:15:52.548
-Then it won't be a bomb any more.
-Exactly.

965
01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:53.967
What are you waiting for?

966
01:15:54.008 --> 01:15:55.969
-I never did it before.
-Jesus.

967
01:15:56.010 --> 01:16:00.682
I can try.
but if I fail. millions will die.

968
01:16:00.723 --> 01:16:03.643
We don't have a choice.
Good luck. Nina.

969
01:16:03.685 --> 01:16:06.020
Be cool.
We'll be outta here in a few minutes.

970
01:16:08.064 --> 01:16:11.985
OK. I will start draining
the fuel tanks.

971
01:16:15.989 --> 01:16:19.284
(Man over PA) Warning!
Three minutes to collision!

972
01:16:19.325 --> 01:16:21.577
Three minutes to collision!

973
01:16:27.125 --> 01:16:29.210
(Grunting)

974
01:16:42.015 --> 01:16:43.516
Damn it! What the hell?

975
01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:46.394
-Da!
-Get me some leverage!

976
01:16:55.153 --> 01:16:57.655
(Singing in Italian)

977
01:17:05.788 --> 01:17:08.833
Warning! You are two minutes
from collision!

978
01:17:08.875 --> 01:17:10.918
You are two minutes from collision!

979
01:17:12.045 --> 01:17:13.629
(John grunts)

980
01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:28.353
(Train horn blowing)

981
01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:44.744
One minute to collision!

982
01:17:44.786 --> 01:17:46.871
One minute to collision!

983
01:17:50.208 --> 01:17:51.417
(Grunting)

984
01:18:02.512 --> 01:18:05.515
Warning! Thirty seconds to collision!

985
01:18:05.556 --> 01:18:07.767
Thirty seconds to collision!

986
01:18:10.478 --> 01:18:11.938
-(Explosion)
-(Passengers whimpering)

987
01:18:34.627 --> 01:18:35.878
(Beeps)

988
01:18:51.727 --> 01:18:53.146
I knew you could do it.

989
01:18:58.985 --> 01:19:00.528
(Chuckles)

990
01:19:10.371 --> 01:19:12.457
(Driver continues singing)

991
01:19:44.447 --> 01:19:46.949
-(Coop) Hi. ma'am.
-Hi.

992
01:19:47.408 --> 01:19:48.701
I'm a friend of John Cutter.

993
01:19:49.577 --> 01:19:51.579
Really? John Cutter?

994
01:19:51.621 --> 01:19:53.581
He told me to come here
and find Jenna.

995
01:19:53.873 --> 01:19:56.000
Said you might have a dog of his
that needs a new home.

996
01:19:56.626 --> 01:19:58.085
Can't have my dog. Coop.

997
01:19:58.628 --> 01:20:01.547
John. Jesus Christ. man.
I thought you were dead!

998
01:20:01.589 --> 01:20:02.798
That was the idea.

999
01:20:03.799 --> 01:20:04.926
Good to see you. bud!

1000
01:20:04.967 --> 01:20:06.093
Hey. man.

1001
01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:09.096
-Hey. baby!
-(Jenna) Hi!

1002
01:20:11.098 --> 01:20:12.350
(Kissing)

1003
01:20:16.437 --> 01:20:18.814
-Heard Nick and Pink both made it.
-They did.

1004
01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:22.443
Thanks for coming up. Coop.
It means a lot.

1005
01:20:22.818 --> 01:20:24.654
You did pretty good
for a ground pounder.

1006
01:20:24.695 --> 01:20:26.364
I'd go to war with you anytime.

1007
01:20:28.241 --> 01:20:30.034
How is General Anderson?

1008
01:20:30.993 --> 01:20:33.287
You know. he's a big hero now.

1009
01:20:33.329 --> 01:20:34.997
Probably gonna run for presidency.

1010
01:20:45.174 --> 01:20:46.634
I don't think he will.

1011
01:20:49.262 --> 01:20:50.596
What you got there?

1012
01:20:50.638 --> 01:20:54.850
You know. broken promises.
lies. murder.

1013
01:21:09.699 --> 01:21:13.160
Jenna. any chance two thirsty men
can get a couple?

1014
01:21:14.996 --> 01:21:16.163
My girl.

1015
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.793
To all our fallen brothers.

1016
01:22:42.375 --> 01:22:44.794
I started writing just like 20 pages

1017
01:22:44.835 --> 01:22:47.004
based off an outline
that Danny provided.

1018
01:22:47.296 --> 01:22:51.050
And. sent it off to him.
and in a couple days. you know.

1019
01:22:51.092 --> 01:22:53.302
we started going on from there.

1020
01:22:53.844 --> 01:22:57.139
And Danny did a really.
really big chunk of it. as well.

1021
01:22:57.181 --> 01:23:00.101
So. you know. it's a huge
collaboration. really.

1022
01:23:00.142 --> 01:23:02.478
(Man) It has everything.
it has trains.

1023
01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:05.940
it has submarines.
it has underwater shots.

1024
01:23:05.981 --> 01:23:07.650
uh. aerial shots.

1025
01:23:08.067 --> 01:23:13.322
Just everything that an action movie
might want. to be a big action movie.

1026
01:23:13.364 --> 01:23:17.076
For a good action movie. I think
you have to care about the character.

1027
01:23:17.118 --> 01:23:19.954
You can blow them all up
in the first five seconds

1028
01:23:19.995 --> 01:23:21.497
and no one will feel anything.

1029
01:23:21.539 --> 01:23:23.874
But if you start
to know the character.

1030
01:23:23.916 --> 01:23:25.501
get their history behind them.

1031
01:23:26.544 --> 01:23:28.045
understand where they're coming from.

1032
01:23:28.087 --> 01:23:30.339
meet their parents.
you know. their kids.

1033
01:23:30.756 --> 01:23:35.136
start to connect with them
on many ways. and then you kill 'em.

1034
01:23:36.345 --> 01:23:37.346
It's important.

1035
01:23:37.722 --> 01:23:39.140
All the actors.

1036
01:23:39.390 --> 01:23:42.768
they were great actors.
even in the very small parts.

1037
01:23:42.810 --> 01:23:44.270
Nobody said no.

1038
01:23:44.311 --> 01:23:47.606
Everyone was really eager
to work with Danny.

1039
01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:52.403
Absolutely new experience
working with American director.

1040
01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:58.826
It's my first experience. and I'm
very impressed how Danny works.

1041
01:23:58.868 --> 01:24:00.035
He's a one-take wonder.

1042
01:24:00.077 --> 01:24:02.538
He knows what he wants
and he gets it right away.

1043
01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:04.874
(Woman) Everything happened
just like that.

1044
01:24:04.915 --> 01:24:08.419
no matter how hard it was.
no matter how little time we had.

1045
01:24:08.461 --> 01:24:10.129
no matter all the obstacles.

1046
01:24:10.171 --> 01:24:13.507
but everything just happened.
It was great.

1047
01:24:13.549 --> 01:24:17.303
Short prep time.
getting the story right. casting.

1048
01:24:17.344 --> 01:24:19.805
everything just seemed to come
together at the last minute.

1049
01:24:19.847 --> 01:24:21.307
but it came together beautifully.

1050
01:25:03.682 --> 01:25:04.767
(Inaudible)

1051
01:25:08.103 --> 01:25:09.438
I can't find shit.

1052
01:25:15.528 --> 01:25:16.570
(Inaudible)

1053
01:25:21.784 --> 01:25:23.994
(Shouting)

1054
01:25:24.578 --> 01:25:26.413
(Laughing)

1055
01:25:35.256 --> 01:25:36.632
-No!
-(Gunshot)

1056
01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:40.344
(Indistinct chatter)

1057
01:25:42.888 --> 01:25:49.395
(Indistinct talking)

1058
01:25:55.526 --> 01:25:58.988
Working with Danny Lerner is magic.

1059
01:25:59.196 --> 01:26:04.743
Danny is family. and it's great
having him back. Everyone enjoys it.

1060
01:26:04.785 --> 01:26:06.871
(In Russian)

1061
01:26:08.038 --> 01:26:09.206
(In English) We are a family.

1062
01:26:09.248 --> 01:26:11.500
Everything comes from him.

1063
01:26:11.542 --> 01:26:16.213
His attitude towards people.
his respect for everyone...

1064
01:26:16.255 --> 01:26:22.303
And it just... It's payback from
everyone who's working in the film.

1065
01:26:22.344 --> 01:26:27.892
All the actors. it's such a warmth.
it's such a care.

1066
01:26:27.933 --> 01:26:29.727
you feel he's a giving person.

1067
01:26:29.768 --> 01:26:34.148
He's also my inspiration
in working here.

1068
01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:37.860
You know. he knows what needs
to be done. how to do it.

1069
01:26:37.902 --> 01:26:39.194
and how to do it efficiently.

1070
01:26:39.236 --> 01:26:41.989
He's got tonne of experience
in the movie business.

1071
01:26:42.031 --> 01:26:43.282
He's at the backbone

1072
01:26:43.324 --> 01:26:47.369
of why Nu Image/Millennium has
been successful for all these years.

1073
01:26:48.078 --> 01:26:49.830
And he doesn't take shit from anyone.

1074
01:26:50.414 --> 01:26:55.920
Before 20 years maybe.
I was very young. and very crazy...

1075
01:26:56.879 --> 01:27:02.301
So. Danny Lerner
was the first producer

1076
01:27:02.343 --> 01:27:07.222
and director that gave me chance

1077
01:27:07.264 --> 01:27:10.100
to supervise the pyro effects.

1078
01:27:10.142 --> 01:27:15.230
Everybody is willing to work
for such a director as Danny.

1079
01:27:15.272 --> 01:27:17.775
(Man) He's good as a producer.
he's good as a director.

1080
01:27:18.108 --> 01:27:20.486
He's just one of those people...
He's a soldier.

1081
01:27:20.527 --> 01:27:22.613
He'll do what it takes
to get the job done.

1082
01:27:22.655 --> 01:27:24.281
Danny. Is he back?

1083
01:27:24.782 --> 01:27:27.451
(Indistinct chatter)

1084
01:27:34.249 --> 01:27:35.250
(Laughs)

1085
01:27:41.298 --> 01:27:45.344
Very professional command of stunt.
Unbelievable.

1086
01:27:45.386 --> 01:27:47.471
(Speaking Russian)

1087
01:27:50.516 --> 01:27:52.017
This is my dream.

1088
01:27:52.059 --> 01:27:54.812
To put Danny front of the camera
to fight with Dojo.

1089
01:27:54.853 --> 01:27:57.272
Or Sergey.

1090
01:27:57.690 --> 01:28:00.025
Danny's gonna kill them. right away.

1091
01:28:00.067 --> 01:28:01.402
He's a good guy.

1092
01:28:01.443 --> 01:28:04.113
He's not that kind of guy. you know.
they're producers and producers.

1093
01:28:04.154 --> 01:28:07.700
Producers who will want to show that
they are the producers.

1094
01:28:08.283 --> 01:28:10.536
And Danny is a good guy.

1095
01:28:10.577 --> 01:28:13.163
You know. it's so good that he knows
precisely what he wants.

1096
01:28:13.205 --> 01:28:17.167
He believes in the close shots
of each character.

1097
01:28:17.209 --> 01:28:19.962
he believes in the energy
between the characters.

1098
01:28:20.004 --> 01:28:22.089
(In Russian)

1099
01:28:27.428 --> 01:28:29.054
(In Russian)

1100
01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:32.891
(Vladimir Vladimirov speaking Russian)

1101
01:28:33.642 --> 01:28:36.020
(Singing in Russian)

1102
01:28:46.363 --> 01:28:48.198
(Speaking Russian)

1103
01:28:54.538 --> 01:28:57.082
(In English)
Danny is a person who. I think.

1104
01:28:57.124 --> 01:29:01.378
knows exactly what he wants.
and he...

1105
01:29:02.087 --> 01:29:04.631
He has a very good way
in talking to actors.

1106
01:29:04.673 --> 01:29:08.343
I think. because he's not gonna
go and tell you...

1107
01:29:08.969 --> 01:29:11.096
He's not gonna make you
go in your head.

1108
01:29:11.138 --> 01:29:12.598
which is the worst thing for an actor.

1109
01:29:12.639 --> 01:29:14.475
If you go in your head. you're done.

1110
01:29:14.516 --> 01:29:16.477
(Chuckles) With this scene.
you're never gonna get it right.

1111
01:29:16.518 --> 01:29:20.439
It's been fun for me and the rest
of the cast to run through flames.

1112
01:29:21.231 --> 01:29:25.235
fire guns. and to jump around.

1113
01:29:25.277 --> 01:29:27.362
like a bunch of kids playing G.I. Joe.

1114
01:29:27.404 --> 01:29:30.616
So. it's been a blessing
and he really knows what he's doing.

1115
01:29:30.657 --> 01:29:33.869
and he's making a real fun movie
for people to enjoy.

1116
01:29:33.911 --> 01:29:36.830
Danny. it's been a joy
working with you.

1117
01:29:36.872 --> 01:29:39.333
You're the man. You're a stud.

1118
01:29:39.374 --> 01:29:42.544
Having a blast.
Thank you for the opportunity.

1119
01:29:42.586 --> 01:29:45.589
Cheers. And I'll see you back
in Los Angeles.
