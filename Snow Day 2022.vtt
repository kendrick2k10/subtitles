00:00:18.152 --> 00:00:19.620
- It's every kid's dream.

4
00:00:19.687 --> 00:00:21.822
A snowstorm hits a town
so hard

5
00:00:21.889 --> 00:00:24.758
that all the roads
are completely undriveable.

6
00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:27.361
- All right. hold on.
Mr. Narrator Guy.

7
00:00:27.428 --> 00:00:28.496
I'll take it from here.

8
00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:30.531
- Uh. okay.

9
00:00:30.598 --> 00:00:33.033
- As he was saying.
sometimes a snowstorm

10
00:00:33.101 --> 00:00:37.138
is so big that school is
canceled for the whole day.

11
00:00:37.205 --> 00:00:39.340
It's a surprise vacation.

12
00:00:39.407 --> 00:00:41.675
a "get out of class free"
card.

13
00:00:41.742 --> 00:00:45.846
a magical. fun day
where anything can happen.

14
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.616
A snow day.

15
00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:50.551
- And now let's turn it over
to Deborah May

16
00:00:50.618 --> 00:00:52.520
for traffic
and weather together.

17
00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:54.288
- Hello. Syracuse!

18
00:00:54.355 --> 00:00:55.656
Our top story today

19
00:00:55.723 --> 00:00:57.725
is that mountain
of snow outside your door.

20
00:00:57.791 --> 00:01:00.094
- You see that darling.
wide-eyed girl?

21
00:01:00.161 --> 00:01:03.297
That's me. Natalie Brandston.
one year ago.

22
00:01:03.364 --> 00:01:05.366
Boy. was I cute!

23
00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:07.101
And next to me

24
00:01:07.168 --> 00:01:10.037
is my charmingly
awkward brother. Hal.

25
00:01:10.104 --> 00:01:11.905
- Undriveable.

26
00:01:11.972 --> 00:01:14.942
I mean. I was lucky to get
out of my garage before it--

27
00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:17.345
- But back to me.
Why do I look nervous?

28
00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:20.381
Because I had a big. old
English paper due that day.

29
00:01:20.448 --> 00:01:22.650
and I hadn't even started.

30
00:01:22.716 --> 00:01:25.953
- I am just getting word
that due to road closures.

31
00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:28.055
all Syracuse schools
will be closed...

32
00:01:29.657 --> 00:01:31.425
Making today

33
00:01:31.492 --> 00:01:32.860
a snow day!

34
00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:33.961
- A snow day?

35
00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:35.763
- It's a snow day!

36
00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.198
- Snow day!
- Snow day!

37
00:01:37.265 --> 00:01:39.700
- * It's a snow day.
snow day! *

38
00:01:39.767 --> 00:01:42.470
* Woo-hoo. let's do it
our way. our way *

39
00:01:42.536 --> 00:01:43.837
* Woo-hoo *

40
00:01:43.904 --> 00:01:45.239

00:01:45.306 --> 00:01:46.874
* Anything
you're dreaming for *

42
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.477
* The world is
knocking at my door *

43
00:01:49.543 --> 00:01:51.512
* It's a snow day *

44
00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:52.780
- * Just what
I've been waiting for *

45
00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:54.448
[giggling]
- Hey. guys.

46
00:01:54.515 --> 00:01:56.750
It's a snow day!
Woo!

47
00:01:56.817 --> 00:02:00.288
- * It might be cold.
but we don't feel it *

48
00:02:00.354 --> 00:02:02.390
* *

49
00:02:02.456 --> 00:02:03.991
* Get up. let's go *

50
00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:06.760
* A little freedom's
all we needed *

51
00:02:06.827 --> 00:02:08.262
* *

52
00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:10.598
- * One big ray of sunshine *

53
00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:15.068
* Backed up
in four little words *

54
00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:19.173
- * The greatest sound
we ever heard *

55
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.308
- This just in...

56
00:02:20.374 --> 00:02:22.543
- * It's a snow day. snow day *

57
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.513
* Woo-hoo
let's do it our way. our way *

58
00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:26.847
* Woo-hoo *

59
00:02:26.914 --> 00:02:28.482
* Everything we're living for *

60
00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:29.783
* Anything
you're dreaming for *

61
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.520
* The world is
knocking at my door *

62
00:02:32.586 --> 00:02:34.655
* It's a snow day *

63
00:02:34.722 --> 00:02:36.156
- * Just what
I've been waiting for *

64
00:02:36.224 --> 00:02:37.691
kids: No books. no rules!

65
00:02:37.758 --> 00:02:39.091
- * Only good vibes *

66
00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.161
- No stress. no school!

67
00:02:41.228 --> 00:02:42.230
- * Only good times *

68
00:02:42.296 --> 00:02:44.164
- No books. no rules!

69
00:02:44.232 --> 00:02:46.867
- * Only good vibes.
only good times *

70
00:02:46.934 --> 00:02:48.101
- Here we go!

71
00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:50.170
- * It's a snow day.
snow day *

72
00:02:50.238 --> 00:02:53.207
* Woo-hoo
let's do it our way. our way *

73
00:02:53.274 --> 00:02:54.608
* Woo-hoo *

74
00:02:54.675 --> 00:02:55.843
* Everything we're living for *

75
00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:57.511
* Anything we're dreaming for *

00:02:57.578 --> 00:03:00.414
* The world is
knocking at my door *

77
00:03:00.481 --> 00:03:02.182
* It's a snow day *

78
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.684
* Just what
I've been waiting for *

79
00:03:03.751 --> 00:03:05.686
* Woo-hoo *

80

00:03:07.288 --> 00:03:08.589
* Woo-hoo *

82
00:03:08.656 --> 00:03:09.857
* It's a snow day *

83
00:03:09.923 --> 00:03:11.492
* Everything we're living for *

84
00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:12.926
* Anything we're dreaming for *

85
00:03:12.993 --> 00:03:15.563
* The world is

86
00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:17.465

00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:19.600

88
00:03:19.667 --> 00:03:21.269
* *

89
00:03:21.335 --> 00:03:23.603
* It's a snow day *

90
00:03:23.671 --> 00:03:27.140
* Oh. it's a snow day *

91
00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:28.376
* Woo-hoo *

92
00:03:28.442 --> 00:03:31.745
* *

93
00:03:31.812 --> 00:03:33.747
- Well. Syracuse.
the unseasonably

94
00:03:33.814 --> 00:03:35.349
warm winter weather
continues today

95
00:03:35.416 --> 00:03:37.385
with a high of 65 degrees.

96
00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:39.987
- Well. here I am one year
later. still cute.

97
00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:42.555
but unfortunately. no snow.

98
00:03:42.623 --> 00:03:44.024
- Here's a fun fact.

99
00:03:44.091 --> 00:03:45.826
On this exact date last year.

100
00:03:45.893 --> 00:03:47.828
Syracuse had a snow day.

101
00:03:47.895 --> 00:03:50.798
- There's nothing fun
about that fact. Deborah.

102
00:03:50.864 --> 00:03:53.033
Hal. you got to help me.

103
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.502
Winter break is in
three days.

104
00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:56.804
and I need to get
out of school until then.

105
00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.506
- How come?
- To get out of all the tests

106
00:03:58.572 --> 00:04:00.040
I refuse to study for!

107
00:04:00.107 --> 00:04:03.477
Right now. I have
a perfect 70% average.

108
00:04:03.544 --> 00:04:05.178
Any dips and it's--
- Winter school?

109
00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:06.947
- Winter school.
- Oh. no.

110
00:04:07.014 --> 00:04:08.148
- Oh. yes.

111
00:04:08.215 --> 00:04:09.683
Summer school's
even more evil twin.

112
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.352
When you leave at
the end of the day.

113
00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:12.920
it's dark and depressing.

114
00:04:12.986 --> 00:04:14.388
And while all
the other kids

115
00:04:14.455 --> 00:04:16.255
are playing with the things
they got for Christmas.

116
00:04:16.324 --> 00:04:18.358
you've got homework.

117
00:04:18.426 --> 00:04:20.260
[suspenseful music]

118
00:04:20.327 --> 00:04:22.029
- Okay. Mom's putting
on her second shoe.

119
00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:23.664
so we don't have a lot of time.

120
00:04:23.731 --> 00:04:24.932
- You and your
freakish hearing.

121
00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:26.367
- Yeah. that's my superpower.

122
00:04:26.434 --> 00:04:27.635
- It's not a superpower.

123
00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:29.102
Nobody would go see
the movie "Ear Man."

124
00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.038
- Okay. if you don't
want my help--

125
00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:33.607
- No. the world needs
Ear Man now. more than ever.

126
00:04:33.674 --> 00:04:35.909
- Okay. okay. uh...
have a stuffed doze.

127
00:04:35.976 --> 00:04:38.145
- Doze?
- Doze. like nose.

128
00:04:38.211 --> 00:04:39.713
And instead of
saying the letter M.

129
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.315
say the letter B.

130
00:04:41.382 --> 00:04:44.652
It'll bake it sound like your
doze is clogged with bucus.

131
00:04:44.718 --> 00:04:46.787
- You're good.
Why don't you ever fake sick?

132
00:04:46.854 --> 00:04:48.556
- Oh. no. I'm just
the ideas guy.

133
00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:50.924
I don't do so hot
with the actual doing.

134
00:04:50.991 --> 00:04:53.361
- He's got above average
hearing and good ideas.

135
00:04:53.427 --> 00:04:54.928
but no follow-through.

136
00:04:54.995 --> 00:04:59.332
Coming this spring. Ear Man.
the anti-action hero.

137
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.201
- I'd see it.

138
00:05:02.836 --> 00:05:04.805
Showtime.
- Okay.

139
00:05:04.872 --> 00:05:06.374
- Time for school. guys.

140
00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.343
- Bob. is that you?

141
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.211
- Who's Bob?

142
00:05:11.278 --> 00:05:14.648
- Sorry. it's my nose.
totally clogged with bucus.

143
00:05:14.715 --> 00:05:16.617
which I'm sure you can hear.

144
00:05:16.684 --> 00:05:18.218
- Sounds pretty bad. huh?

145
00:05:18.285 --> 00:05:19.953
- Actually. it sounds like
somebody's trying to

146
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.789
get out of all of her tests
the next three days

147
00:05:21.855 --> 00:05:24.124
so she doesn't have to
go to winter school.

148
00:05:26.226 --> 00:05:30.297
Ear Man gets his above average
hearing from Ear Mom.

149
00:05:30.364 --> 00:05:33.066
Now. that's a movie I'd see.

150
00:05:33.133 --> 00:05:34.234
- Phew.

151
00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:35.469
You'll figure
something else out.

152
00:05:35.536 --> 00:05:37.471
- Good morning. family.

153
00:05:37.538 --> 00:05:39.172
- Hey. Dad.
- Morning. Dad.

154
00:05:39.239 --> 00:05:41.542
- I am Cop-o-dile.

155
00:05:41.609 --> 00:05:46.213
half cop. half croc.
all business.

156
00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:47.581
[whispers] Okay.
go steal something.

157
00:05:47.648 --> 00:05:49.483
and then I'll bite you
in the name of justice.

158
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.252
- Sorry. Randy. I don't have
time to play with you today.

159
00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:53.954
- Why not?

160
00:05:54.021 --> 00:05:57.791
- Because like the
mighty croc. I'm swamped.

161
00:05:59.058 --> 00:06:00.227
- [sighs]

162
00:06:00.293 --> 00:06:02.129
- Whoa. whoa. whoa.
whoa. whoa. Randy.

163
00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:04.565
Did you know that the crocodile
releases heat

164
00:06:04.632 --> 00:06:07.568
through his mouth because
he doesn't have sweat glands?

165
00:06:07.635 --> 00:06:09.703
- Ugh.

166
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.405
- It's a fun fact.

167
00:06:11.472 --> 00:06:14.442
- Do no adults understand
the meaning of fun fact?

168
00:06:14.508 --> 00:06:17.310
[phone buzzes]
- Oh. yes!

169
00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.613
The spotlight operator for the
winter dance recital is sick.

170
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.348
- With what?
Something contagious?

171
00:06:21.415 --> 00:06:22.816
I will lick him.

172
00:06:22.883 --> 00:06:24.952
- It means I get to run
the spotlight after school.

173
00:06:25.018 --> 00:06:27.721
- Why are you so excited
about running the spotlight?

174
00:06:27.788 --> 00:06:30.290
- What?

175
00:06:30.357 --> 00:06:31.692
No reason.

176
00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:33.894
No. I--I just love
the craft...

177
00:06:33.961 --> 00:06:37.264
of light...spotting.

178
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.172
- It's a girl.

["Dance of the Sugar
Plum Fairy"]

180
00:06:48.476 --> 00:06:55.415
* *

181
00:07:07.294 --> 00:07:08.496
- Oh!

182
00:07:08.562 --> 00:07:10.097
[laughing] Lane.

183
00:07:10.163 --> 00:07:12.299
Oh. I seriously think you just
shaved a year off of my life.

184
00:07:12.365 --> 00:07:13.834
- It wasn't going
to be a great year.

185
00:07:13.901 --> 00:07:15.235
I checked.
- Ha ha.

186
00:07:15.302 --> 00:07:16.269
- Here.

187
00:07:16.336 --> 00:07:18.138
- Oh. thank you.

188
00:07:18.205 --> 00:07:21.441

189
00:07:21.509 --> 00:07:22.910
[squealing]

190
00:07:22.976 --> 00:07:25.145
- That was lovely. Claire.
All right.

191
00:07:25.212 --> 00:07:27.414
My dancers on stage
can take a break.

192
00:07:27.481 --> 00:07:29.149
We're moving on to
the nondenominational

193
00:07:29.216 --> 00:07:30.417
winter dance.

194
00:07:30.484 --> 00:07:33.220
- Don't you get bored
all alone up here?

195
00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:34.287
- No way.

196
00:07:34.354 --> 00:07:36.256
No. this is like
my perfect job.

197
00:07:36.323 --> 00:07:37.525
I get to shine
a light on the stage.

198
00:07:37.591 --> 00:07:39.126
but stay in the shadows.

199
00:07:39.192 --> 00:07:41.261
I control the spotlight.
but I'm out of it.

200
00:07:41.328 --> 00:07:42.596
- How poetic.

201
00:07:42.663 --> 00:07:44.532
- Plus. I can stare at
Claire all rehearsal.

202
00:07:44.598 --> 00:07:45.666
and it's not weird.

203
00:07:45.733 --> 00:07:46.734
- How pathetic.

204
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.135
- Mittens. can you come--

205
00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:50.270
no. left.
You're on the left.

206
00:07:50.337 --> 00:07:51.104
No. you're on the--

207
00:07:51.171 --> 00:07:52.606
all right. all right!

208
00:07:52.673 --> 00:07:55.576
You're mittens. not gloves!

209
00:07:55.643 --> 00:07:57.077
I need a five.

210
00:07:57.745 --> 00:07:58.912
- [chuckles]

211
00:07:58.979 --> 00:08:01.782
[indistinct chatter]

212
00:08:03.884 --> 00:08:07.955
- Well. as riveting as it is to
watch you watch Claire Bonner.

213
00:08:08.021 --> 00:08:10.624
I think I saw some
paint drying outside.

214
00:08:10.691 --> 00:08:12.325
So got to get to that.

215
00:08:12.392 --> 00:08:13.694
- Hey. you want
to grab some food

216
00:08:13.761 --> 00:08:14.862
when I'm out of rehearsal?

217
00:08:14.928 --> 00:08:17.698
- I do. but first...
[snaps] shoes.

218
00:08:17.765 --> 00:08:19.032
Lift.

219
00:08:19.099 --> 00:08:21.368
Who am I?
- You're my hero.

220
00:08:21.434 --> 00:08:23.236
- You know. I don't like
you being up so high.

221
00:08:23.303 --> 00:08:26.306
considering you're. shall
we say. less than graceful.

222
00:08:26.373 --> 00:08:28.576
I mean. you do tend
to fall a lot when--

223
00:08:28.642 --> 00:08:29.577
- Shh. shh. Claire's talking.

224
00:08:29.643 --> 00:08:31.779
- [gasp] She is?

225
00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:33.480
Hold on.

226
00:08:33.547 --> 00:08:35.549
Hi. TMZ?
Hot goss.

227
00:08:35.616 --> 00:08:37.717
Claire Bonner is talking.

228
00:08:37.784 --> 00:08:39.052
No. I'm 100%--

229
00:08:39.119 --> 00:08:41.054
- Okay. okay. go watch
your paint dry.

230
00:08:41.121 --> 00:08:42.722
- Yeah. yeah. yeah.
[giggles]

231
00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:45.025
- And that is why turtlenecks
will never go out of fashion.

232
00:08:45.092 --> 00:08:46.493
- She makes
a compelling argument.

233
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.462
- Yeah. but all I think
about is the poor turtle

234
00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:50.931
who had to die to make it.

235
00:08:50.998 --> 00:08:52.099
- No. Missy.
- Missy. you don't seriously--

236
00:08:52.165 --> 00:08:53.701
- No. okay. but.
like. do you think

237
00:08:53.767 --> 00:08:58.305
a turtleneck would hide
or accentuate. you know...

238
00:08:58.371 --> 00:08:59.640
my short neck?

239
00:08:59.707 --> 00:09:01.108
[gasp] Oh. my gosh!

240
00:09:01.174 --> 00:09:02.743
- What?
- My whale necklace is gone.

241
00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:04.878
- Okay. well. where's the last
place you remember wearing it?

242
00:09:04.945 --> 00:09:06.546
- Oh. probably around her neck.

243
00:09:06.614 --> 00:09:08.649
- Missy. I worry about you.
- No. Missy.

244
00:09:08.716 --> 00:09:10.851
- Okay. I'm back
and I am calm now.

245
00:09:10.918 --> 00:09:12.519
So let's take
this from the top.

246
00:09:12.586 --> 00:09:14.755
- I haven't taken that necklace
off since my dad got it for me

247
00:09:14.822 --> 00:09:16.590
in Barcelona five years ago.

248
00:09:16.657 --> 00:09:19.026
- Wow. this is like as bad
as it gets for incredibly

249
00:09:19.092 --> 00:09:20.493
beautiful teenage girls.

250
00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.029
- Yeah!

251
00:09:22.095 --> 00:09:25.332
Plus it distracts from.
you know...

252
00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:26.900
my short neck!

253
00:09:26.967 --> 00:09:28.501
- Mm.
- Mm.

254
00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.103
- Your neck is perfect.

255
00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.572
- No. you're on the--
hey. what's going on?

256
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.208
- Oh. uh. sorry. every--ahh!

257
00:09:35.275 --> 00:09:36.209
[gasping]

258
00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:42.182
[uneasy music]

259
00:09:42.249 --> 00:09:43.383
Ugh.

260
00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:45.886
- There he is.

261
00:09:46.654 --> 00:09:48.889
You're lucky this
Abominable Snowman costume

262
00:09:48.956 --> 00:09:50.590
broke your fall.

263
00:09:50.658 --> 00:09:52.459
Let me get a look at you.

264
00:09:54.962 --> 00:09:56.529
I think he's having a seizure.

265
00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:59.199
Is anyone here a doctor?
- We're kids!

266
00:10:00.233 --> 00:10:02.402
- I'm fine.
I-'m-I'm fine.

267
00:10:02.469 --> 00:10:04.037
- All right. out of
my way. out of my way.

268
00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:05.338
Next of kin.
keeper of the will.

269
00:10:05.405 --> 00:10:06.940
- Nat. what are you doing here?

270
00:10:07.007 --> 00:10:08.241
- I'm your emergency contact.

271
00:10:08.308 --> 00:10:09.409
- What are you doing here?

272
00:10:09.476 --> 00:10:10.844
I let you out
of second period

273
00:10:10.911 --> 00:10:12.512
because you said
you had a tapeworm.

274
00:10:12.579 --> 00:10:15.248
- Jen. if you want to send
me to Principal Baker.

275
00:10:15.315 --> 00:10:18.051
I'd be happy to show him
the website

276
00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:20.587
where you sell
stolen school supplies.

277
00:10:20.654 --> 00:10:21.722
[school bell rings]

278
00:10:21.789 --> 00:10:23.090
- [huffs. laughs]

279
00:10:23.156 --> 00:10:26.059
- Ugh. Hey. why are you
my emergency contact

280
00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:27.427
and not Mom or Dad?

281
00:10:27.494 --> 00:10:29.029
- I changed it in the
school's computer system

282
00:10:29.096 --> 00:10:30.397
so I have an excuse
to ditch class

283
00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:32.032
every time you do
something clutzy

284
00:10:32.099 --> 00:10:33.633
and hurt yourself. which--

285
00:10:33.701 --> 00:10:35.135
let's be real. babe. is often.

286
00:10:35.202 --> 00:10:36.203
Ha!
- Truth.

287
00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:37.871
Up top.
- Woo!

288
00:10:37.938 --> 00:10:39.740
- Natalie Brandston.
are you jumping?

289
00:10:39.807 --> 00:10:41.909
I let you out of a Spanish
test today because

290
00:10:41.975 --> 00:10:43.243
you said you had a hernia.

291
00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:49.082
- Uhh...

292
00:10:50.517 --> 00:10:52.252
[clears throat]

293
00:10:53.086 --> 00:10:54.654
- How many teachers do
you have blackmailed?

294
00:10:54.722 --> 00:10:57.157
- No such thing as blackmail
among friends.

295
00:10:57.224 --> 00:10:59.092
- Natalie Brandston.

296
00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:02.462
- Ms. Reynolds. to what
do I owe the pleasure?

297
00:11:02.529 --> 00:11:03.897
- Just thought I would
remind you

298
00:11:03.964 --> 00:11:05.665
of your math test tomorrow.

299
00:11:05.733 --> 00:11:07.634
- Oh. I wouldn't miss it!

300
00:11:07.701 --> 00:11:09.903
I mean. unless a distant
relative died suddenly.

301
00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:11.638
or I contracted
mad cow disease.

302
00:11:11.705 --> 00:11:14.107
- Listen. I know how you
intimidate the other teachers.

303
00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:15.909
There's even a Natalie
Brandston support group

304
00:11:15.976 --> 00:11:17.277
that meets at lunch.

305
00:11:17.344 --> 00:11:19.412
But it's not going
to work on me.

306
00:11:19.479 --> 00:11:21.214
You're taking
that test tomorrow.

307
00:11:21.281 --> 00:11:22.983
If you fail. I'll see you
in winter school.

308
00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:25.986
And we'll add.
subtract. multiply.

309
00:11:26.053 --> 00:11:28.521
and divide
until the sun goes down.

310
00:11:30.157 --> 00:11:31.524
- Why didn't you
blackmail Ms. Reynolds?

311
00:11:31.591 --> 00:11:32.793
- Because I got nothing.

312
00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:33.927
Reynolds is mean.
but she's clean.

313
00:11:33.994 --> 00:11:34.995
You know what I need?

314
00:11:35.062 --> 00:11:36.797
- Uh. to study?
- Ew! No.

315
00:11:36.864 --> 00:11:38.265
I need a snow day.

316
00:11:38.331 --> 00:11:39.266
- Nat. I don't
think we're getting

317
00:11:39.332 --> 00:11:40.801
a snow day anytime soon.

318
00:11:40.868 --> 00:11:43.937
Rebecca Menderson is
officially #Rebeccamending

319
00:11:44.004 --> 00:11:45.438
wearing shorts tomorrow.

320
00:11:45.505 --> 00:11:47.941
- I am officially
#Rebeccamending

321
00:11:48.008 --> 00:11:49.042
wearing shorts tomorrow.

322
00:11:49.109 --> 00:11:50.543
- See?

323
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:51.845
- Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

324
00:11:51.912 --> 00:11:53.246
We got to do the snow dance.

325
00:11:53.313 --> 00:11:54.547
- The snow dance?
- No. we're not doing

326
00:11:54.614 --> 00:11:56.249
the snow dance.
- Aha! I don't think

327
00:11:56.316 --> 00:11:57.885
I've ever seen you dance.

328
00:11:57.951 --> 00:11:59.186
- Well. and that
streak shall continue.

329
00:11:59.252 --> 00:12:01.221
- Hal. the snow dance works.
- No. it doesn't.

330
00:12:01.288 --> 00:12:03.056
- It did last year.
- Like three weeks later.

331
00:12:03.123 --> 00:12:04.424
- So?
It's not an exact science.

332
00:12:04.491 --> 00:12:05.826
- It's the exact
opposite of science.

333
00:12:05.893 --> 00:12:07.895
- Ugh! Why can't you be
more like Snow Day Hal?

334
00:12:07.961 --> 00:12:09.429
- Snow Day Hal?
- Yeah. he's like

335
00:12:09.496 --> 00:12:11.031
a totally different
person on snow days.

336
00:12:11.098 --> 00:12:12.866
I mean. last year.
you successfully

337
00:12:12.933 --> 00:12:14.134
sledded down Dead Sled Hill.

338
00:12:14.201 --> 00:12:15.668
- Well. true. but that was--

339
00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:17.437
- And then you entered that
snowman building competition

340
00:12:17.504 --> 00:12:19.672
and built one that looked
so much like JoJo Siwa.

341
00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:21.041
it got featured on the news!

342
00:12:21.108 --> 00:12:22.575
- Yeah. I was proud
of Snow Snow Siwa.

343
00:12:22.642 --> 00:12:24.411
- And then you did
a celebratory snow lap

344
00:12:24.477 --> 00:12:25.879
around the block
in nothing but shorts.

345
00:12:25.946 --> 00:12:27.414
- Didn't even feel the cold.

346
00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.117
- Yeah. 'cause Snow Day Hal
has a whole different vibe.

347
00:12:30.183 --> 00:12:32.652
Snow Day Hal
is fun and fearless.

348
00:12:32.719 --> 00:12:35.055
- Well. isn't regular
Hal fun and fearless?

349
00:12:35.122 --> 00:12:36.556
- Nah.
- No.

350
00:12:38.125 --> 00:12:41.161
- No. there is something
freeing about a snow day.

351
00:12:41.228 --> 00:12:43.163
Most days. I wake up.
I'm like...

352
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.332
this again. me again.

353
00:12:45.398 --> 00:12:47.901
But on a snow day.
oh. you wake up to a--

354
00:12:47.968 --> 00:12:49.937
to a blank white canvas

355
00:12:50.003 --> 00:12:52.205
just begging you
to paint something bold.

356
00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:54.207
- That was kind of beautiful.

357
00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:56.743
- Yes. it was gorgeous.
stunning.

358
00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:58.245
all of the fancy adjectives.

359
00:12:58.311 --> 00:13:00.047
Now will you do the snow
dance with me already?

360
00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:02.082
- A snow day would be nice.

361
00:13:02.149 --> 00:13:04.251
Everyone's
so carefree and happy.

362
00:13:04.317 --> 00:13:07.287
And that outdoor
skating rink is everything.

363
00:13:07.354 --> 00:13:09.056
Do your dance.
- What. now?

364
00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:11.424
- Yes! I won't look.

365
00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:19.566
- * Sha la la la la la *

366
00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:22.302
* Sha la la la la la *

367
00:13:22.369 --> 00:13:24.504
* Sha la la
la la *

368
00:13:24.571 --> 00:13:26.606
* Sha la la la la *

369
00:13:26.673 --> 00:13:29.409
* La ooh *

370
00:13:29.476 --> 00:13:30.477
- Hal?

371
00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:33.346
Hello?

372
00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:37.550
What are you...

373
00:13:37.617 --> 00:13:39.319
Ugh! Men.

374
00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:45.558
- In the mood for
shakes and/or cakes?

375
00:13:45.625 --> 00:13:47.928
- Always. but what if Claire
is at the Shake and Cake

376
00:13:47.995 --> 00:13:49.329
with her hot boyfriend?

377
00:13:49.396 --> 00:13:50.797
- Okay. was the hot necessary?

378
00:13:50.864 --> 00:13:53.433
- When you're as hot as
Chuck Wheeler. it kinda is.

379
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.435
- Ooh. is hot Chuck that
hot guy in your grade

380
00:13:55.502 --> 00:13:57.971
who's really hot?
[giggling]

381
00:13:58.038 --> 00:14:01.341
[gasping. laughing]

382
00:14:01.408 --> 00:14:02.775
- Order number 42!

383
00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:04.777
Order 42!

384
00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:06.579
- Hey. how are you doing?

385
00:14:06.646 --> 00:14:08.882
- How'd you get a girl
as cool as Claire?

386
00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:10.850
- Ha ha. Come on.

387
00:14:10.918 --> 00:14:12.252
- * Love is easy. man *

388
00:14:12.319 --> 00:14:13.853
* You gotta keep it breezy.
man *

389
00:14:13.921 --> 00:14:15.688
* Tell her that she's
pretty and she's witty *

390
00:14:15.755 --> 00:14:18.158
* And then tell her
she's the only girl *

391
00:14:18.225 --> 00:14:20.627
* In the whole world you see *

392
00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:22.629
* And then I'll leave her
with a picture of me *

393
00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:23.596
- Wow!

394
00:14:23.663 --> 00:14:24.664
* Love is simple. man *

395
00:14:24.731 --> 00:14:26.266
* Sharpen up your tempo. man *

396
00:14:26.333 --> 00:14:29.002
* Buy a little pressy. make
a rezzy somewhere dressy *

397
00:14:29.069 --> 00:14:30.403
* Then pull up to her door *

398
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:32.906
* She'll be begging
for more of me *

399
00:14:32.973 --> 00:14:34.040
- Of you!

400
00:14:34.107 --> 00:14:35.808
- You know that it's true.
Ow!

401
00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:39.179
- * Is that really all it takes
for a guy to get a date? *

402
00:14:39.246 --> 00:14:40.480
- * Oh! *

403
00:14:40.547 --> 00:14:42.482
* It's a piece of cake *

404
00:14:42.549 --> 00:14:43.483
Woo!

405
00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.318
- Ugh. Claire. Chuck is so hot.

406
00:14:45.385 --> 00:14:46.386
- He's scorching.

407
00:14:46.453 --> 00:14:48.188
- He's boiling like water.

408
00:14:48.255 --> 00:14:49.522
- Wait. what?

409
00:14:49.589 --> 00:14:51.058
- * Yeah. he's cute and all *

410
00:14:51.124 --> 00:14:52.692
* Looks good in a suit
and all *

411
00:14:52.759 --> 00:14:55.328
* But he doesn't focus.
didn't notice when I changed *

412
00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:56.896
* The way I style my hair *

413
00:14:56.964 --> 00:14:58.431
- Wait. what?
- I know.

414
00:14:58.498 --> 00:14:59.832
- * It's totally different *

415
00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:00.968
* You cut off 8 inches *

416
00:15:01.034 --> 00:15:02.369
- I know!

417
00:15:02.435 --> 00:15:04.037
- * But does he take
you on the town? *

418
00:15:04.104 --> 00:15:05.405
- * I guess he does *

419
00:15:05.472 --> 00:15:07.307
- * Say you're the
cutest one around? *

420
00:15:07.374 --> 00:15:09.309
- * Yeah. but he doesn't
ask me *

421
00:15:09.376 --> 00:15:10.543
* About my favorite
red things *

422
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.179
* Am I not interesting? *

423
00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:13.113
- * You are *

424
00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:14.647
- I know.

425
00:15:14.714 --> 00:15:16.316
- * Is that really
all it takes *

426
00:15:16.383 --> 00:15:18.885
* Asking questions on a date? *

427
00:15:18.952 --> 00:15:20.253
- Yup. it's a piece of cake.

428
00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.422
* *

429
00:15:22.489 --> 00:15:25.492
- * Now I got what I want
'cause I got her *

430
00:15:25.558 --> 00:15:28.628
- * And maybe
this was all a mistake *

431
00:15:28.695 --> 00:15:31.464
- * Looking hot and
I'm feeling even hotter *

432
00:15:31.531 --> 00:15:34.467
- * Then tell me why can't
love be a piece of *

433
00:15:34.534 --> 00:15:36.336

00:15:36.403 --> 00:15:37.904
* A piece of cake.

435
00:15:37.971 --> 00:15:40.407
* It's a piece of cake.

436
00:15:40.473 --> 00:15:42.475
* Cake.

437
00:15:42.542 --> 00:15:44.211
* A piece of cake. cake! *

438
00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:45.845
* It's a piece of cake *

439
00:15:45.912 --> 00:15:47.347
* Cake. cake *

440
00:15:47.414 --> 00:15:51.584
* I just wanna have my cake
and I wanna eat it. too *

441
00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:54.721
- * Here's a piece for you *

442
00:15:54.787 --> 00:15:56.223
Ooh. babe!

443
00:15:56.289 --> 00:15:57.657
* You look beautiful *

444
00:15:57.724 --> 00:15:58.925
- * Tell me something
I don't know *

445
00:15:58.992 --> 00:16:00.560
- * You're the most
incredible *

446
00:16:00.627 --> 00:16:02.329
* Of any babe
I've ever known *

447
00:16:02.395 --> 00:16:03.396
- * Now. isn't that sweet? *

448
00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:05.432
- * I'm as sweet as can be *

449
00:16:05.498 --> 00:16:08.168
- * The most beautiful
couple in the world *

450
00:16:08.235 --> 00:16:11.438
- * Do you really think
that I'm that great? *

451
00:16:11.504 --> 00:16:14.641
- * Without you.
my heart would ache! *

452
00:16:14.707 --> 00:16:17.844
Trust me. Claire.
falling in love with you

453
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:19.279
was a piece of cake.

454
00:16:19.346 --> 00:16:21.248
- * Cake!
It's a piece of cake *

455
00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:23.083
* A piece of cake. cake! *

456
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:24.417
* It's a piece of cake *

457
00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:26.053
* Oh. piece of cake. cake! *

458
00:16:26.119 --> 00:16:28.321
* It's a piece of cake.

459
00:16:28.388 --> 00:16:30.257
* Cake!
It's a piece of cake *

460
00:16:30.323 --> 00:16:31.791
* It's a piece of cake *

461
00:16:31.858 --> 00:16:33.560
* I just wanna have
my cake *

462
00:16:33.626 --> 00:16:36.029
* And I wanna eat it. too *

463
00:16:36.096 --> 00:16:37.730
* Too *

464
00:16:37.797 --> 00:16:39.966
- * Too *

465
00:16:40.033 --> 00:16:42.302
* It's a piece of cake! *

466
00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:45.305
- Oh. my gosh.
That was so much fun.

467
00:16:45.372 --> 00:16:47.040
[chatter. laughter]

468
00:16:54.147 --> 00:16:55.882
- Oh. come.

469
00:16:58.585 --> 00:17:00.120
- Chuck. you're going
to be absolutely

470
00:17:00.187 --> 00:17:03.423
blown away by how gorge
Claire is in the recital.

471
00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.758
- I wouldn't miss it.
When is it again?

472
00:17:05.825 --> 00:17:07.394
- This Saturday.

473
00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:08.795
- Wait. this Saturday?
- Uh-oh.

474
00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:11.431
- Oh. God.
- I call it Caturday.

475
00:17:13.465 --> 00:17:16.336
- We'll let you two
do your thing.

476
00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:19.506
- [clears throat]
Claire Bear.

477
00:17:19.571 --> 00:17:21.973
I got Syracuse football
tickets Saturday night.

478
00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.310
- What?

479
00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:25.444
- I didn't know it was
that important to you.

480
00:17:25.512 --> 00:17:27.146
- You didn't know
my dance performance

481
00:17:27.214 --> 00:17:29.516
was that important to me?

482
00:17:29.582 --> 00:17:31.551
Chuck. sometimes I think
you don't know me at all.

483
00:17:31.618 --> 00:17:33.553
- I know you.
- Okay.

484
00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:35.255
What is my favorite color?

485
00:17:35.322 --> 00:17:37.390
- It's. uh. the--

486
00:17:37.457 --> 00:17:38.391
the--

487
00:17:38.458 --> 00:17:39.392
- Teal.

488
00:17:39.459 --> 00:17:41.194
- Uh...

489
00:17:41.261 --> 00:17:43.596
- Okay. what food
can I not stand?

490
00:17:43.663 --> 00:17:46.933
- That's easy.
It's the s-spaghetti?

491
00:17:46.999 --> 00:17:48.235
Uh...

492
00:17:48.301 --> 00:17:50.203
- Pickles.
- They're pickles!

493
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:51.504
- Well. what's
my favorite food?

494
00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:53.373
- Toast.
- Heck yeah it is.

495
00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.242
Soft and crunchy
at the same time.

496
00:17:55.308 --> 00:17:56.876
- Oh. my gosh.
Okay. we're done.

497
00:17:56.943 --> 00:17:58.178
Just go.

498
00:17:58.245 --> 00:18:00.547
- Whoa. Are you seriously
breaking up with me

499
00:18:00.613 --> 00:18:02.249
because I don't know
your favorite color?

500
00:18:02.315 --> 00:18:04.817
- I don't know what I'm
going to do yet. so just go.

501
00:18:04.884 --> 00:18:06.119
- Fine!

502
00:18:09.189 --> 00:18:10.423
Brown.

503
00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:12.392
- Nobody's favorite
color is brown!

504
00:18:12.459 --> 00:18:14.127
- I think brown
is kinda cool.

505
00:18:19.065 --> 00:18:20.567
- What happened. babe?

506
00:18:20.633 --> 00:18:22.202
- We heard every word.

507
00:18:22.269 --> 00:18:24.804
- Missy. why?
- Missy. think before you talk!

508
00:18:25.738 --> 00:18:27.974
- You should go talk to her.

509
00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.609
- You say that like it's not
the most terrifying thing

510
00:18:29.676 --> 00:18:30.810
I could possibly imagine.

511
00:18:30.877 --> 00:18:32.912
- You just need an icebreaker.

512
00:18:36.383 --> 00:18:37.617
What's that?

513
00:18:37.684 --> 00:18:39.051
- After I fell today.

514
00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:40.953
I found Claire's
missing whale necklace.

515
00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:42.822
- This is amazing.

516
00:18:42.889 --> 00:18:44.824
You have a reason
to talk to her.

517
00:18:44.891 --> 00:18:47.427
- Yeah. but I also
have to say words.

518
00:18:47.494 --> 00:18:49.429
- Well. lucky for you.

519
00:18:49.496 --> 00:18:51.097
you have a female best friend

520
00:18:51.164 --> 00:18:52.732
and a rather cool one.
if I'm being honest.

521
00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:54.000
- Okay. get to the point.

522
00:18:54.066 --> 00:18:57.103
- What I. a girl.
would want you. a guy.

523
00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:00.273
to do right now is walk over.
take out that necklace.

524
00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:01.941
and say. super cas...

525
00:19:02.008 --> 00:19:04.744
"I thought
you might be missing this."

526
00:19:04.811 --> 00:19:07.580
- So what you're telling me
is that I have to have swag?

527
00:19:07.647 --> 00:19:09.416
Something I've never
possessed my whole life.

528
00:19:09.482 --> 00:19:10.550
- Precisely.
- Ah.

529
00:19:10.617 --> 00:19:12.352
- Here. try it on me.
- No.

530
00:19:12.419 --> 00:19:14.687
- Come on.
You want to get the girl?

531
00:19:14.754 --> 00:19:16.789
You got to do it.
Come on. Hal.

532
00:19:16.856 --> 00:19:18.491
You got this.
- Okay. okay.

533
00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:22.995
Hey. I. uh...

534
00:19:23.062 --> 00:19:25.432
I thought you might
be missing this.

535
00:19:26.533 --> 00:19:27.767
- [laughs]

536
00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:29.869
- Lane.
- I'm sorry.

537
00:19:29.936 --> 00:19:31.504
What are you doing
with your eyebrows?

538
00:19:31.571 --> 00:19:33.773
- I don't know.
- Well. don't do it.

539
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.876
- What. don't do this?
- [laughs]

540
00:19:36.943 --> 00:19:38.878
All right. go get
us some cake. swaggy Hal.

541
00:19:38.945 --> 00:19:41.080
- Oh. it would be swaggy
Hal's greatest pleasure.

542
00:19:41.147 --> 00:19:43.082
- Ha ha.
- Huh huh.

543
00:19:43.149 --> 00:19:47.220
* *

544
00:19:47.287 --> 00:19:49.689
[gasping]

545
00:19:51.057 --> 00:19:53.226
- Your shirt is
so much cuter green.

546
00:19:53.293 --> 00:19:54.527
Smile!

547
00:19:54.594 --> 00:19:56.329
- Put the phone down.
- Missy. timing.

548
00:19:56.396 --> 00:19:58.265
- Oh. shoot. it's a video.

549
00:19:58.331 --> 00:20:00.400
Here's the guy who helped
Claire's shirt be better.

550
00:20:00.467 --> 00:20:01.668
Say hi. guy.

551
00:20:01.734 --> 00:20:04.971
- Missy!
- Missy!

552
00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:10.843
- Ugh!

553
00:20:12.779 --> 00:20:14.814
- Whatever problems
you're having.

554
00:20:14.881 --> 00:20:17.517
trust me. mine are
20 times worse.

555
00:20:17.584 --> 00:20:18.951
- It's just not fair.

556
00:20:19.018 --> 00:20:21.621
Math has no practical
application in life.

557
00:20:21.688 --> 00:20:24.324
Ever heard of a calculator?

558
00:20:24.391 --> 00:20:26.459
- You know what. I bet
if you tried really hard.

559
00:20:26.526 --> 00:20:28.060
you could pass that test
tomorrow.

560
00:20:28.127 --> 00:20:29.896
- Yeah. I bet that if
you tried really hard.

561
00:20:29.962 --> 00:20:31.998
you could run a 30-minute mile.

562
00:20:33.766 --> 00:20:36.603
Looks like it's winter school
for your old pal Natalie.

563
00:20:41.574 --> 00:20:42.809
- [sighs]

564
00:20:42.875 --> 00:20:45.044
- Snow dance?
- Snow dance!

565
00:20:47.614 --> 00:20:48.948
[rhythmic chanting]
- Fee. fi. fum. fo!

566
00:20:49.015 --> 00:20:51.150
You and me are gonna
make it snow!

567
00:20:51.217 --> 00:20:52.585
Woo!

568
00:20:52.652 --> 00:20:54.854
We're gonna make it
fall onto the floor!

569
00:20:54.921 --> 00:20:55.722
Woo!

570
00:20:55.788 --> 00:20:57.490
Here we go. here we go!

571
00:20:57.557 --> 00:20:59.759
S-N-O-W and me

572
00:20:59.826 --> 00:21:01.260
are double trouble

573
00:21:01.328 --> 00:21:02.462
- Bring it on down. Nat!

574
00:21:02.529 --> 00:21:03.696
Bring it on down. Nat!

575
00:21:03.763 --> 00:21:04.864
- I'm bringing it down!
- Woo!

576
00:21:04.931 --> 00:21:05.898
Bring it on down. Nat.

577
00:21:05.965 --> 00:21:07.300
Bring it on down.
Nat!

578
00:21:07.367 --> 00:21:09.369
- Woo!
Make it snow. bro.

579
00:21:09.436 --> 00:21:10.403
Make it snow. bro.

580
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:11.438
- Ooh. ooh.

581
00:21:11.504 --> 00:21:12.605
- Make it snow. bro.

582
00:21:12.672 --> 00:21:14.240
Make it snow. bro.

583
00:21:14.307 --> 00:21:15.675
- Ah. shimmy to the right.

584
00:21:15.742 --> 00:21:17.076
And shimmy to the left.

585
00:21:17.143 --> 00:21:18.945
And jump until
you're out of breath.

586
00:21:19.011 --> 00:21:20.246
and jump until you're
out of breath.

587
00:21:20.313 --> 00:21:21.948
and jump until
you're out of breath!

588
00:21:22.014 --> 00:21:24.517
- Jump until
you're out of...breath.

589
00:21:24.584 --> 00:21:26.419
Whew! Okay.

590
00:21:26.486 --> 00:21:28.821
Now on the off. off chance
that that didn't work.

591
00:21:28.888 --> 00:21:30.557
you should probably study.

592
00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:32.325
- First. I gotta
find my math book.

593
00:21:32.392 --> 00:21:33.426
That's history.

594
00:21:33.493 --> 00:21:36.162
- [laughs]

595
00:21:36.228 --> 00:21:38.565
- Man. I'm surprised
you're in such good spirits.

596
00:21:38.631 --> 00:21:39.999
- Why?

597
00:21:40.066 --> 00:21:41.634
- Oh. no reason.

598
00:21:41.701 --> 00:21:43.202
I mean...

599
00:21:44.971 --> 00:21:46.072
Someone took a video of you

600
00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:47.607
spilling a milkshake
on Claire Bonner

601
00:21:47.674 --> 00:21:49.041
that kind of went viral.

602
00:21:49.108 --> 00:21:50.309
- What?

603
00:21:50.377 --> 00:21:52.244
- Your shirt is so much
cuter green.

604
00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:54.614
g-g-green.
C-c-cuter. Smile!

605
00:21:54.681 --> 00:21:55.915
Sm-sm-smile.

606
00:21:55.982 --> 00:21:58.351

I'm not the coolest guy *

that most girls like *

I've got a chance *

612
00:22:10.062 --> 00:22:12.264

it'd be just fine *

I've got a chance *

615

* But do I do it?
Maybe. I think so *

616
00:22:21.841 --> 00:22:24.977
* Do I do it?
What if you say no? *

617
00:22:25.044 --> 00:22:27.680
* I can't make up my mind *

618
00:22:27.747 --> 00:22:30.717
* So I need a sign *

619
00:22:30.783 --> 00:22:32.585
* Something that I can see *

620
00:22:32.652 --> 00:22:35.722
* Can you give me a sign? *

621
00:22:35.788 --> 00:22:38.558
* Something to guide me *

622
00:22:38.625 --> 00:22:40.760
* Show me what to do *

623
00:22:40.827 --> 00:22:42.395

to you? *

just to try *

all gas stations
are also closed

666

due to last night's
unprecedented snowstorm.

When I woke up
and looked out the window.

I thought I was dreaming.

I went to bed in shorts.

life story. Deborah.

Give the people what they want!

I'm Snow Day Hal.

- Welcome. Snow Day Hal!
So what's first?

683
00:25:01.568 --> 00:25:04.771
Skiing. ice fishing.
skiing while ice fishing?

684
00:25:04.837 --> 00:25:06.639
- Actually.
I'm gonna spend today

685
00:25:06.706 --> 00:25:08.608
trying to get the girl
who's way out of my league

686
00:25:08.675 --> 00:25:10.042
and has a boyfriend.

687
00:25:10.109 --> 00:25:11.611
- That's my swaggy brother.

688
00:25:11.678 --> 00:25:14.113
- And hey. you have a full day
to study for that math test.

689
00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.448
- No. I have a full day to
get us a second snow day.

690
00:25:16.515 --> 00:25:18.050
And then it's winter break.

691
00:25:18.117 --> 00:25:19.952
- Okay. well. how do you plan
on getting a second snow day?

692
00:25:20.019 --> 00:25:21.120
If it stops snowing.

693
00:25:21.187 --> 00:25:22.689
these roads
are going to get cleared.

694
00:25:22.755 --> 00:25:24.957
and that means everything will
open back up again tomorrow.

695
00:25:25.024 --> 00:25:26.425
including school.

696
00:25:26.492 --> 00:25:28.861
- Not if I stop the guy
who plows the roads.

You know. but he's a maniac.

[honking]
- Move it! Get outta the way!

701
00:25:37.203 --> 00:25:38.938

wolf blood before plowing

702
00:25:39.005 --> 00:25:40.439

703
00:25:40.506 --> 00:25:41.908
And that he ripped the braces
off the last kid

705
00:25:43.175 --> 00:25:44.443

into brass knuckles.

706
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:46.278
- Well. lucky for me.
I have perfect teeth.

707
00:25:46.345 --> 00:25:48.247
Plus. anything can
happen on a snow day.

708
00:25:48.314 --> 00:25:51.550
- Nat. going after
Snowplowman is kinda insane.

709
00:25:51.618 --> 00:25:53.385
- Says the guy
who's going after the girl

710
00:25:53.452 --> 00:25:56.322
who's way out of his league
and has a boyfriend.

711
00:25:57.857 --> 00:25:58.791
- Take him down. sis.

712
00:25:58.858 --> 00:26:00.860
- Get the girl. bro.

713
00:26:02.428 --> 00:26:03.996
Hey. Hal.

714
00:26:04.063 --> 00:26:06.733
If we get a second snow day.
wanna spend it together?

715
00:26:06.799 --> 00:26:08.367
- That's a deal.

716
00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:19.679
- Hi. Ha.

717
00:26:19.746 --> 00:26:21.881
- Hello. darling.
Eli and Wayne are in the fort.

718
00:26:21.948 --> 00:26:23.115
- Oh. I'm sorry.

719
00:26:23.182 --> 00:26:25.051
I didn't realize
Eli had a sister.

720
00:26:25.117 --> 00:26:27.119
- [laughs] Oh. Natalie.

721
00:26:27.186 --> 00:26:28.621
[video sounds]
- Die. werewolf. die!

722
00:26:28.688 --> 00:26:29.756
- I'm losing. Elf Boy!

723
00:26:29.822 --> 00:26:30.857
- Move!

724
00:26:30.923 --> 00:26:32.291
- What are you bozos doing?

725
00:26:32.358 --> 00:26:33.893
- We're playing
this marvelous video game

726
00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.461
wherein one attempts
to ward off werewolves

727
00:26:35.527 --> 00:26:36.829
whilst building a shack.

728
00:26:36.896 --> 00:26:39.165
- It's called Werewolf Shack.
- Care to play?

729
00:26:39.231 --> 00:26:40.432
- Hey!
- Hey!

730
00:26:40.499 --> 00:26:42.234
- Hey. yourselves!

731
00:26:42.301 --> 00:26:44.837
Don't you guys realize that
today is no ordinary day?

732
00:26:44.904 --> 00:26:46.038
Today's a snow day.

733
00:26:46.105 --> 00:26:47.940
That means anything can happen.

734
00:26:48.007 --> 00:26:49.709
We can do anything we want.

735
00:26:49.776 --> 00:26:51.043
So do you wanna
spend the day

736
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:52.444
taking down lame.
fake werewolves.

737
00:26:52.511 --> 00:26:54.146
or do you wanna
spend the day

738
00:26:54.213 --> 00:26:56.415
taking down
someone scary and real?

739
00:26:56.482 --> 00:26:57.416
- Like who?

740
00:26:57.483 --> 00:26:58.885
- Snowplowman.

741
00:26:58.951 --> 00:27:00.853
[gasping]
- Snowplowman?

742
00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.022
But he's a maniac.

743
00:27:03.089 --> 00:27:05.958
I heard a man once
made fun of his snow plow.

744
00:27:06.025 --> 00:27:07.960
so he plowed
the chap's motorcar.

745
00:27:08.027 --> 00:27:10.529
- Listen.
If we take down Snowplowman.

746
00:27:10.596 --> 00:27:11.964
we get a second snow day.

747
00:27:12.031 --> 00:27:13.866
- No. that's way too dangerous.

748
00:27:13.933 --> 00:27:15.567
- Well. if we don't try.

749
00:27:15.634 --> 00:27:17.203
then you guys
won't see me all break.

750
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:18.771
because I'll be
in winter school.

751
00:27:18.838 --> 00:27:19.772
- Nonsense. my queen.

752
00:27:19.839 --> 00:27:21.007
I fight with you.
- Great.

753
00:27:21.073 --> 00:27:22.308
You in. Wayne?

754
00:27:22.374 --> 00:27:23.442
- Does this answer
your question?

755
00:27:23.509 --> 00:27:25.011
Yeah!

756
00:27:25.077 --> 00:27:26.979
- Who are we taking down?

757
00:27:27.046 --> 00:27:30.049
all: Snowplowman!

758
00:27:30.116 --> 00:27:31.350
[computer chime]

759
00:27:31.417 --> 00:27:34.653
- Freeze!
This is Sheriff Randy.

760
00:27:34.721 --> 00:27:37.957
You better not steal
something. or I got you. babe.

761
00:27:38.024 --> 00:27:39.425
- Oh. okay.

762
00:27:39.491 --> 00:27:40.893
- [whispering]
Steal something!

763
00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.829
- Uh. Sheriff. well. I can't.

764
00:27:42.895 --> 00:27:44.263
I'm working.

765
00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:47.199
- But do you believe
in play after work?

766
00:27:47.266 --> 00:27:49.401
- No. it's a snow day. people.

767
00:27:49.468 --> 00:27:52.071
- Well. it's not a snow day
for mommies and daddies.

768
00:27:52.138 --> 00:27:53.873
We still have to work.
Sorry. bud.

769
00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:55.775
- Okay.

770
00:27:55.842 --> 00:27:57.744
- What am I doing with
these taxes right here?

771
00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:00.713
[clicking sound]
Oh. uh. Randy. what did I say?

772
00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:03.415
I was working. right?
Remember. I just said that?

773
00:28:03.482 --> 00:28:06.318
- You have the right
to remain silent.

774
00:28:06.385 --> 00:28:08.687
- Oh. very funny.
But--

775
00:28:08.755 --> 00:28:11.958
- Bet you wish you could
turn back time now.

776
00:28:12.024 --> 00:28:13.359
- Sheriff. we appreciate--

777
00:28:13.425 --> 00:28:14.894
- Sorry.
- That you are

778
00:28:14.961 --> 00:28:18.030
a musical officer of the law
and that we're being no fun.

779
00:28:18.097 --> 00:28:19.365
but we really do have to work.
So...

780
00:28:19.431 --> 00:28:20.599
- Ow.

781
00:28:20.666 --> 00:28:21.801
- If you could take
these off. please?

782
00:28:21.868 --> 00:28:23.502
- Yeah. I mean we have to
meet our deadline

783
00:28:23.569 --> 00:28:25.704
so that we can
make money to buy you.

784
00:28:25.772 --> 00:28:29.809
you know. hats and wigs
and badges and water guns.

785
00:28:29.876 --> 00:28:31.643
- Hand over the devices.

786
00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:33.312
- No. come on.
- Yes.

787
00:28:33.379 --> 00:28:35.581
- My computer?
- Yes.

788
00:28:35.647 --> 00:28:37.016
- All right. fine.
but that's it.

789
00:28:37.083 --> 00:28:39.585
I need to use my phone.
- And the phones.

790
00:28:39.651 --> 00:28:41.420
Come on.

791
00:28:41.487 --> 00:28:42.755
All of them.

792
00:28:42.822 --> 00:28:43.890
- That's all we have.

793
00:28:43.956 --> 00:28:45.792
[phone rings]

794
00:28:45.858 --> 00:28:47.026
Where was that one?

795
00:28:47.093 --> 00:28:48.360
Okay. you have
all of our stuff.

796
00:28:48.427 --> 00:28:51.397
Now can you please uncuff us?

797
00:28:51.463 --> 00:28:54.000
- Not until I have
the perfect snow day.

798
00:28:54.066 --> 00:28:56.335
And first. I want
the perfect pancakes.

799
00:28:56.402 --> 00:28:57.937
- [scoffs]
- No. w--

800
00:28:58.004 --> 00:29:01.073
- Kinda hard to do that when
you're handcuffed together.

801
00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:02.574
- Yeah.

802
00:29:02.641 --> 00:29:06.212
- Then I suppose you'll
have to make them together.

803
00:29:08.547 --> 00:29:09.982
- Oh! Hoo!

804
00:29:10.049 --> 00:29:11.483
[laughter]

805
00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:12.484
- Ah!

806
00:29:12.551 --> 00:29:14.653
- Come here!

807
00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.223
- Okay. let's beat the rush
to the rink--come on.

808
00:29:17.289 --> 00:29:18.858
- Oh. I can't.
- Why not?

809
00:29:18.925 --> 00:29:20.626
- Well. because
I'm Snow Day Hal.

810
00:29:20.692 --> 00:29:22.962
and I can't let whatever
comes over me on a snow day

811
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:24.596
go to waste. so...

812
00:29:24.663 --> 00:29:26.265
I'm gonna get Claire.

813
00:29:26.332 --> 00:29:27.566
- Oh.
Hm.

814
00:29:27.633 --> 00:29:29.468
- What?
- No. nothing. I just--

815
00:29:29.535 --> 00:29:31.070
I thought
I'd be spending the snow day

816
00:29:31.137 --> 00:29:33.105
with my best friend.
which is exactly

817
00:29:33.172 --> 00:29:35.007
what I'm gonna do.
'cause you need

818
00:29:35.074 --> 00:29:36.475
all the help you can get.

819
00:29:36.542 --> 00:29:38.777
- You're my hero.
- No lies detected.

820
00:29:38.845 --> 00:29:40.779
Now. let's see the plan.

821
00:29:40.847 --> 00:29:41.814
- The plan?

822
00:29:41.881 --> 00:29:43.782
- Hal. I know you.

823
00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:46.218
You have a handwritten plan
complete with funny drawings

824
00:29:46.285 --> 00:29:47.887
somewhere on you.

825
00:29:47.954 --> 00:29:49.721
Let's see it.

826
00:29:49.788 --> 00:29:52.091
- [sighs]
Fine.

827
00:29:54.093 --> 00:29:56.362
- [reading]

828
00:29:56.428 --> 00:29:57.763
Wait. why by sundown?
- Well. because

829
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:59.365
it's a snow day.
When the sun goes down.

830
00:29:59.431 --> 00:30:00.933
it'll be a snow night.
and that's not a thing.

831
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.302
- So what's the first step?
Wear this really cool sweater?

832
00:30:03.369 --> 00:30:05.437
- Hey. I like this sweater.

833
00:30:05.504 --> 00:30:07.173
- Oh ho ho.
I'm aware you do.

834
00:30:07.239 --> 00:30:09.675
- No. first step.
make an impression.

835
00:30:09.741 --> 00:30:13.412
I'm going to go to her
house and hold this up.

836
00:30:15.781 --> 00:30:17.449
- I don't get it.

837
00:30:17.516 --> 00:30:19.818
- What?
Whale you. like...

838
00:30:19.886 --> 00:30:21.020
like
will you go out with me?

839
00:30:21.087 --> 00:30:22.321
Only it's whale you
go out with me

840
00:30:22.388 --> 00:30:23.489
because of the whale necklace.

841
00:30:23.555 --> 00:30:25.224
Man. I thought that was clear.

842
00:30:25.291 --> 00:30:28.127
- [laughs]
I'm messing with you.

843
00:30:28.194 --> 00:30:29.128
It's whale-y good.

844
00:30:29.195 --> 00:30:30.662
- Whale-y?

845
00:30:30.729 --> 00:30:31.797
- Would I say "whale-y"
if I didn't whale-y.

846
00:30:31.864 --> 00:30:32.831
whale-y mean it?

847
00:30:32.899 --> 00:30:34.200
[laughs]

848
00:30:35.634 --> 00:30:37.569
- Yeah. okay. that's her house.

849
00:30:37.636 --> 00:30:39.238
- Good luck.
- Hey. Snow Day Hal

850
00:30:39.305 --> 00:30:40.772
doesn't need luck.
- Yeah.

851
00:30:40.839 --> 00:30:43.375
[engine roaring]

852
00:30:43.442 --> 00:30:45.978
- Okay. maybe a little luck.

853
00:30:46.045 --> 00:30:47.579
Go. go. go.

854
00:30:56.622 --> 00:31:00.326
- Claire Bear.
I have something to say!

855
00:31:02.028 --> 00:31:03.429
- What is it. Chuck?

856
00:31:03.495 --> 00:31:04.796
Are you going to miss
my birthday next year

857
00:31:04.863 --> 00:31:06.198
for a toast convention?

858
00:31:06.265 --> 00:31:08.968
- Look. that Chuck
yesterday was old Chuck.

859
00:31:09.035 --> 00:31:10.436
This is new Chuck.

860
00:31:10.502 --> 00:31:12.671
And new Chuck would
drop anything for you.

861
00:31:12.738 --> 00:31:15.741
- Hmm.
Why should I believe you now?

862
00:31:19.411 --> 00:31:21.480
- If it wasn't clear.

863
00:31:21.547 --> 00:31:24.516
I just ripped the Syracuse
football game ticket in half.

864
00:31:27.086 --> 00:31:28.754
- All right. come in.

865
00:31:31.023 --> 00:31:33.092
- Let's--let's go get
some hot chocolate.

866
00:31:33.159 --> 00:31:35.094
Your treat. come on.

867
00:31:35.161 --> 00:31:36.795
- No. no. no. no.

868
00:31:36.862 --> 00:31:40.132
Normally. this would be defeat.
but not for Snow Day Hal.

869
00:31:40.199 --> 00:31:41.567
I could still make
an impression.

870
00:31:41.633 --> 00:31:43.869
I just gotta. uh...
just gotta plan my next move.

871
00:31:43.936 --> 00:31:46.805
- Well. Chuck's in her house.
and you're not.

872
00:31:46.872 --> 00:31:48.907
- Wait. wait.

873
00:31:52.278 --> 00:31:53.512
I'm going to get
in her house. too.

874
00:31:53.579 --> 00:31:54.880
- Wait. Hal.
her house is that way.

875
00:31:54.947 --> 00:31:56.548
What is your freak--
it's just here.

876
00:31:56.615 --> 00:31:57.749
- You'll see.
- But it's--

877
00:31:57.816 --> 00:31:59.185
- Anything can
happen on a snow day.

878
00:31:59.251 --> 00:32:00.352
- Wait!
Wait!

879
00:32:00.419 --> 00:32:01.587
Shoes.
Lift.

880
00:32:01.653 --> 00:32:04.056
- Okay. quickly.
- Yeah.

881
00:32:04.123 --> 00:32:05.958
Who am I?
- You're my hero. Bye!

882
00:32:06.025 --> 00:32:07.559
- Bye.

883
00:32:07.626 --> 00:32:09.928
- Okay. guys. if we're going
to take down a living monster

884
00:32:09.996 --> 00:32:11.897
and get a second snow day.
these snowballs

885
00:32:11.964 --> 00:32:13.199
got to be packed tight.

886
00:32:13.265 --> 00:32:15.101
- Fine.

887
00:32:15.167 --> 00:32:17.569
- Lucky for us. Snowplowman
overposts on social media.

888
00:32:17.636 --> 00:32:19.305
so I know he's stopping
right around here from

889
00:32:19.371 --> 00:32:20.806
mid-morning until we break.

890
00:32:20.872 --> 00:32:22.741
- And I did a few
calculations to determine

891
00:32:22.808 --> 00:32:24.310
how the wind chill
factor might affect

892
00:32:24.376 --> 00:32:25.677
the arc of the snowball.

893
00:32:25.744 --> 00:32:26.745
- Ew. math.

894
00:32:26.812 --> 00:32:28.047
We're good.

895
00:32:28.114 --> 00:32:29.048
Wayne. you've got
a sling for us?

896
00:32:29.115 --> 00:32:30.382
- Right here.

897
00:32:30.449 --> 00:32:32.284
- [laughing]

898
00:32:32.351 --> 00:32:33.452
- Don't laugh at me.

899
00:32:33.519 --> 00:32:35.487
It's my grandma's. okay?

900
00:32:35.554 --> 00:32:37.123
It's the best I can
do on short notice.

901
00:32:37.189 --> 00:32:38.790
- Okay.

902
00:32:38.857 --> 00:32:40.059
Plan is to distract
him with the balls

903
00:32:40.126 --> 00:32:41.360
and then jab a hole
in one of his tires.

904
00:32:41.427 --> 00:32:42.461
- Brilliant.

905
00:32:42.528 --> 00:32:43.996
- Not the way to
go if you ask me.

906
00:32:44.063 --> 00:32:44.997
- We didn't.

907
00:32:45.064 --> 00:32:46.498
- Fine.

908
00:32:46.565 --> 00:32:48.000
Then you won't get to
hear my genius idea.

909
00:32:48.067 --> 00:32:49.135
- Good.

910
00:32:49.201 --> 00:32:50.202
- Sinkhole.

911
00:32:50.269 --> 00:32:51.537
- What's a sinkhole?

912
00:32:51.603 --> 00:32:53.305
- A cavity in the ground
caused by erosion.

913
00:32:53.372 --> 00:32:56.208
One does not simply
create a sinkhole.

914
00:32:56.275 --> 00:32:58.277
- Not with that attitude.

915
00:32:58.344 --> 00:33:02.148
[honking]

916
00:33:02.214 --> 00:33:03.882
- Snowplowman.

917
00:33:03.949 --> 00:33:07.453
[dramatic music]

918
00:33:07.519 --> 00:33:09.188
- Snowplowman. pull over!

919
00:33:09.255 --> 00:33:12.024
The sunlight is hitting us
at an ideal angle.

920
00:33:12.091 --> 00:33:15.994
and I would like to suggest
taking a commemorative selfie.

921
00:33:17.063 --> 00:33:18.564
- Great idea. Trudy.

922
00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:20.266
You know. they don't make
them like you anymore.

923
00:33:20.332 --> 00:33:22.000
- Actually. they do.

924
00:33:22.068 --> 00:33:24.903
I'm a standard artificial
intelligence device

925
00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:28.174
that you program to
remind you to eat. tell you

926
00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.176
that you're handsome...
- Hey.

927
00:33:30.242 --> 00:33:32.111
- You're not a disappointment
to your mother.

928
00:33:32.178 --> 00:33:33.312
- Okay. selfie time!

929
00:33:33.379 --> 00:33:35.281
- Mm-hmm.

930
00:33:35.347 --> 00:33:38.217
Cheese!

931
00:33:38.284 --> 00:33:39.251
[camera lens snaps]

932
00:33:39.318 --> 00:33:40.852
- Oh. that is a framer.

933
00:33:42.321 --> 00:33:45.357
* I love
clearing snow in winter *

934
00:33:45.424 --> 00:33:48.627
* And seeing the
pavement shine through *

935
00:33:48.694 --> 00:33:51.963
* I love driving
in a blizzard *

936
00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:55.134
* The cold
and my lips turning blue *

937
00:33:55.201 --> 00:33:58.904
* I love holiday movies
and acai smoothies *

938
00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:01.006
* And Trudy.
I love you to bits *

939
00:34:01.073 --> 00:34:02.574
- Aww.

940
00:34:02.641 --> 00:34:06.112
- * But I hate. hate. hate.
hate. hate these kids *

941
00:34:06.178 --> 00:34:08.746
* *

942
00:34:08.813 --> 00:34:11.917
* I love the thrill of
online shopping *

943
00:34:11.983 --> 00:34:14.786
* For gadgets
to spruce up my ride *

944
00:34:14.853 --> 00:34:18.623
* I love staying up
and watching the Tonys *

945
00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:20.792
* With Mom by my side *

946
00:34:20.859 --> 00:34:23.929
* I love small vegan cafes
and pumpkin spice lattes *

947
00:34:23.995 --> 00:34:26.697
* And a good social media
blitz *

948
00:34:26.764 --> 00:34:31.002
* But I hate. hate. hate.
hate. hate these kids *

949
00:34:31.069 --> 00:34:32.638
* *

950
00:34:32.704 --> 00:34:36.275
* At the first snowflake
of the season *

951
00:34:36.342 --> 00:34:39.545
* I shed a tear of joy *

952
00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:42.181
* A mission
that I can believe in *

953
00:34:42.248 --> 00:34:47.085
* To make sure
their dreams are destroyed! *

954
00:34:47.152 --> 00:34:50.021
* I love setting up
my playlist *

955
00:34:50.088 --> 00:34:53.024
* The ultimate
mega plow mix! *

956
00:34:53.091 --> 00:34:56.094
* I love my rising
social status *

957
00:34:56.161 --> 00:34:58.964
* And rocking
these customized kicks *

958
00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:02.434
* I love night vision cameras
and matching pajamas *

959
00:35:02.501 --> 00:35:05.003
* Love being the guy
who admits *

960
00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:09.575
* That I hate hate. hate.
hate. hate these kids *

961
00:35:09.641 --> 00:35:12.077
* *

962
00:35:12.144 --> 00:35:15.714
* This time of year
takes me right back *

963
00:35:15.781 --> 00:35:18.650
* To that fateful
snow day past *

964
00:35:18.717 --> 00:35:21.453
* I was only eight years old *

965
00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:24.523
* *

966
00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:27.426
* I had a brand new
snow plow toy *

967
00:35:27.493 --> 00:35:30.396
* Steering. racing.
so much joy *

968
00:35:30.462 --> 00:35:34.800
* I couldn't even
feel the cold *

969
00:35:34.866 --> 00:35:36.568
* Then they stuck up
from behind *

970
00:35:36.635 --> 00:35:38.069
* They ripped it from
my grasp *

971
00:35:38.136 --> 00:35:39.871
* They stole it--
gone forever! *

972
00:35:39.938 --> 00:35:41.973
* They pointed
and they laughed *

973
00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:46.812
* The rudest. meanest
gang of nasty kids *

974
00:35:46.878 --> 00:35:48.647
* From that day on *

975
00:35:48.714 --> 00:35:54.786
* I vowed to make them
suffer like I did *

976
00:35:54.853 --> 00:35:57.088
- Therapy appointment
scheduled Monday. 9:00 a.m.

977
00:35:57.155 --> 00:35:58.824
- Trudy. not now!

978
00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:01.793
* I love laughing
in their faces! *

979
00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:05.231
* Now it's my turn to be mean *

980
00:36:05.297 --> 00:36:10.569
* I love people of all ages.
except if they're under 18 *

981
00:36:10.636 --> 00:36:12.271
* I love having the power *

982
00:36:12.338 --> 00:36:16.275
* I know it's my hour to wipe
snow days right off the grid *

983
00:36:16.342 --> 00:36:19.978
* Because I hate. hate.
hate. hate. hate these *

984
00:36:20.045 --> 00:36:22.814
* Just can't tolerate these *

985
00:36:22.881 --> 00:36:28.186
* Hate. hate. hate.
hate. hate these kids! *

986
00:36:32.358 --> 00:36:33.959
- Okay. here he comes.

987
00:36:34.025 --> 00:36:35.927
Snowball me.
- Yes. my lady.

988
00:36:35.994 --> 00:36:37.829
- Wayne. get that sling ready.
- Eli. catch.

989
00:36:37.896 --> 00:36:38.997
- Got it.

990
00:36:40.566 --> 00:36:42.368
- Ah!

991
00:36:42.434 --> 00:36:44.035
Yeah!

992
00:36:44.102 --> 00:36:45.337
Snack time. Trudy.

993
00:36:45.404 --> 00:36:46.472
- Mm-mm.

994
00:36:46.538 --> 00:36:49.107
- Oh. my favorite. anchovies.

995
00:36:49.174 --> 00:36:50.342
- Very pungent.

996
00:36:50.409 --> 00:36:51.877
- You know where
you're going. huh?

997
00:36:51.943 --> 00:36:52.978
- [grunt]

998
00:36:53.044 --> 00:36:54.112
- Uhh--

999
00:36:54.179 --> 00:36:55.414
- Give me the piercer.

1000
00:36:55.481 --> 00:36:57.082
Now throw. throw. throw!

1001
00:36:59.217 --> 00:37:00.419
- Kids.

1002
00:37:00.486 --> 00:37:02.554
- There they are!

1003
00:37:02.621 --> 00:37:05.156
[suspenseful music]

1004
00:37:05.223 --> 00:37:07.426
- Hey!
- Hey. children. stop that!

1005
00:37:07.493 --> 00:37:09.361
- Stop it!
- Oh. you bad kids!

1006
00:37:09.428 --> 00:37:11.263
- Knock it off! Hey!

1007
00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:13.865
Oh. I'm gonna get you.

1008
00:37:13.932 --> 00:37:16.234
Knock it off!
- Do something. Snowplowman!

1009
00:37:16.302 --> 00:37:17.269
- Stop throwing!

1010
00:37:17.336 --> 00:37:19.070
[air hissing]

1011
00:37:22.207 --> 00:37:23.509
[groans]

1012
00:37:25.377 --> 00:37:26.978
Flat tire. huh?

1013
00:37:29.281 --> 00:37:31.216
[laughing]

1014
00:37:35.987 --> 00:37:38.290
Trudy. activate mega cannon.

1015
00:37:38.357 --> 00:37:39.257
- Activated!

1016
00:37:40.826 --> 00:37:43.194
Here...we...go...

1017
00:37:43.261 --> 00:37:45.631
- Snow in the hole!

1018
00:37:46.865 --> 00:37:48.166
Scatter!

1019
00:37:49.935 --> 00:37:51.903
Trudy. you got 'em targeted?
- Bull's-eye.

1020
00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:53.805
- Hey. wait!
- We've gotta get out of here!

1021
00:37:53.872 --> 00:37:55.441
- Nice try. kiddies.

1022
00:37:55.507 --> 00:37:57.576
You ain't getting
no second snow day.

1023
00:38:00.546 --> 00:38:02.714
- Nothing is a bigger
threat to fashion than snow.

1024
00:38:02.781 --> 00:38:05.183
- Ugh!
Why can't you just be longer?

1025
00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:07.085
- That's why I'm here
to officially

1026
00:38:07.152 --> 00:38:10.456
#Rebeccamend you start your
early afternoon off with a...

1027
00:38:10.522 --> 00:38:12.290
- Hey. babe.
- Butter's in the fridge.

1028
00:38:12.358 --> 00:38:13.492
- Love you.

1029
00:38:13.559 --> 00:38:14.526
- Chuck.

1030
00:38:14.593 --> 00:38:15.861
- Yeah. babe.

1031
00:38:15.927 --> 00:38:17.429
- Make sure the toaster
is plugged in.

1032
00:38:17.496 --> 00:38:19.431
- Who's better than you?

1033
00:38:20.065 --> 00:38:21.867
- This way.
you're gonna keep warm

1034
00:38:21.933 --> 00:38:23.535
without having to
sacrifice your silhouette.

1035
00:38:23.602 --> 00:38:25.303
- Claire!
Claire Bonner!

1036
00:38:25.371 --> 00:38:28.774
- Um. I'm Rebecca.
Rebecca Menderson.

1037
00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:31.343
- Uh. yeah. I know.
and-and letting me speak

1038
00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:33.445
for a moment would be
my official #Rebeccamendation.

1039
00:38:33.512 --> 00:38:35.547
- [gasp] That is trademarked!

1040
00:38:35.614 --> 00:38:38.083
- Claire Bonner. hi.

1041
00:38:38.149 --> 00:38:40.386
My name is--is Hal Brandston.

1042
00:38:40.452 --> 00:38:43.121
You probably don't know me
other than yesterday's

1043
00:38:43.188 --> 00:38:45.391
milkshake malfunction.
but I know you.

1044
00:38:45.457 --> 00:38:48.494
I know that when you're
nervous. you eat candy corn.

1045
00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:50.095
I know that you hate pickles.

1046
00:38:50.161 --> 00:38:52.330
And I know that you love
to dance more than anything

1047
00:38:52.398 --> 00:38:54.400
in the world.
- Okay. yeah. this is--

1048
00:38:54.466 --> 00:38:55.734
this is great.

1049
00:38:55.801 --> 00:38:57.002
This is really sweet
and all. but I'm

1050
00:38:57.068 --> 00:38:58.770
going to have to
officially #Rebeccamend

1051
00:38:58.837 --> 00:39:00.506
that you leave immediately.
or I'm going to call security.

1052
00:39:00.572 --> 00:39:02.207
- Security?
- Security!

1053
00:39:04.342 --> 00:39:06.011
Dad!

1054
00:39:12.518 --> 00:39:15.353
- I still think a sinkhole
would be way more efficient.

1055
00:39:15.421 --> 00:39:17.756
- I truly don't know how many
more times I can tolerate him

1056
00:39:17.823 --> 00:39:19.491
saying the word "sinkhole."

1057
00:39:19.558 --> 00:39:22.227
- Let's try this first and then
revisit sinkhole. okay. buddy?

1058
00:39:22.293 --> 00:39:24.730
- Well. my grandma needs
this wig back by 4:00.

1059
00:39:24.796 --> 00:39:27.198
She's not too happy that
I stole her bra either.

1060
00:39:27.265 --> 00:39:29.134
- Snowplowman
is about 45 seconds away.

1061
00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.469
- How do you know?

1062
00:39:30.536 --> 00:39:31.637
- I took the liberty of
adding a tracking device

1063
00:39:31.703 --> 00:39:33.805
to one of
the snowballs you launched.

1064
00:39:33.872 --> 00:39:35.941
- Does this coat
make me look boxy?

1065
00:39:36.007 --> 00:39:37.776
[honking]
- Shh!

1066
00:39:37.843 --> 00:39:39.244
He's coming.

1067
00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:41.146
Let's go!

1068
00:39:43.549 --> 00:39:44.916
- Oh. no. is it snowing?

1069
00:39:44.983 --> 00:39:46.351
My grandma's going
to kill me if she

1070
00:39:46.418 --> 00:39:48.286
finds out I got her hat wet!
- Just get out there!

1071
00:39:48.353 --> 00:39:49.988
I'm not taking that test.

1072
00:39:51.457 --> 00:39:52.524
- Danger!
- Aah!

1073
00:39:52.591 --> 00:39:53.792
- Stop!
- Danger!

1074
00:39:53.859 --> 00:39:55.861
[both screaming]
Danger! Danger!

1075
00:40:02.033 --> 00:40:04.703
- Lady!
Lady. are you okay?

1076
00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:07.072
Lady. I'm sorry.
Are you hurt?

1077
00:40:07.138 --> 00:40:09.074
Are you okay?
Are you--

1078
00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:11.943
- You ought to be
ashamed of yourself!

1079
00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:13.912
- Jeez. you pack some
heat right there.

1080
00:40:13.979 --> 00:40:14.980
Listen. lady. I'm sorry--

1081
00:40:15.046 --> 00:40:16.848
- My name is not lady.

1082
00:40:16.915 --> 00:40:19.284
My name is Gillie Butler.
and I demand respect!

1083
00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:21.386
- Okay. Gillie. sorry.

1084
00:40:21.453 --> 00:40:23.121
You came out of nowhere.

1085
00:40:23.188 --> 00:40:24.923
You're lucky I didn't
plow you over.

1086
00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:26.725
- Find the keys.
Find the keys.

1087
00:40:26.792 --> 00:40:27.893
- Yes. milady.

1088
00:40:27.959 --> 00:40:29.495
- Intruder detected.

1089
00:40:29.561 --> 00:40:30.762
- What is that?

1090
00:40:30.829 --> 00:40:33.064
- I have half a mind
to call the police!

1091
00:40:33.131 --> 00:40:34.365
- Hey!

1092
00:40:34.432 --> 00:40:36.468
All right. let's just
put our purses down

1093
00:40:36.535 --> 00:40:38.069
and leave the feds out of it!

1094
00:40:38.136 --> 00:40:41.372
- I am Trudy. property of
the gorgeous snowplowman.

1095
00:40:41.439 --> 00:40:45.010
who was potty trained at
a perfectly appropriate age.

1096
00:40:45.076 --> 00:40:47.746
- I have 13 strong-bodied
sons that wouldn't mind

1097
00:40:47.813 --> 00:40:49.347
teaching you a lesson.

1098
00:40:49.414 --> 00:40:50.348
- All right--

1099
00:40:50.415 --> 00:40:51.650
13 sons?

1100
00:40:51.717 --> 00:40:52.818
- Mm-hmm.

1101
00:40:52.884 --> 00:40:54.486
- Wait a second. Gillie.
[ahem]

1102
00:40:54.553 --> 00:40:56.087
What year were you born?

1103
00:40:56.154 --> 00:40:58.023
- Oh. 2008.
- Nah-yea--

1104
00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:00.358
- Ow.
- You're a kid.

1105
00:41:00.425 --> 00:41:01.860
[honk]

1106
00:41:02.728 --> 00:41:04.896
Ah ha. ha. ha!

1107
00:41:04.963 --> 00:41:06.765
You looking for these?

1108
00:41:06.832 --> 00:41:08.534
- Grab the bird.
- With alacrity. madam.

1109
00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:09.901
- Easy. easy.

1110
00:41:09.968 --> 00:41:11.670
- Let's go. You're coming
with me. Get over here.

1111
00:41:11.737 --> 00:41:12.671
- No.
No.

1112
00:41:12.738 --> 00:41:13.872
- Come on.
Come on.

1113
00:41:13.939 --> 00:41:15.073
- No.
- You're coming with me.

1114
00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:17.142
Yeah. you stupid kids!

1115
00:41:17.208 --> 00:41:18.877
You think you can trick me.
you stupid kid?

1116
00:41:18.944 --> 00:41:20.411
Get up in there.
Go on.

1117
00:41:20.478 --> 00:41:22.614
Get up.
Get up.

1118
00:41:22.681 --> 00:41:25.116
Wait. where's my--
where's the--

1119
00:41:25.183 --> 00:41:26.117
Trudy.

1120
00:41:26.184 --> 00:41:27.352
Trudy!

1121
00:41:27.418 --> 00:41:28.554
Where's...

1122
00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:34.492
Trudyyyyyyy!

1123
00:41:38.664 --> 00:41:39.831
- Hi. Hal.

1124
00:41:39.898 --> 00:41:41.099
- Ugh!

1125
00:41:41.166 --> 00:41:42.801
You know. someday
I'm gonna surprise you.

1126
00:41:42.868 --> 00:41:44.302
- Oh. I'm sure you will.

1127
00:41:44.369 --> 00:41:45.904
- Can you say that a
little less patronizing?

1128
00:41:45.971 --> 00:41:48.006
- I don't think I can.

1129
00:41:48.073 --> 00:41:50.041
- Hey. did you see me
on #Rebeccamendations?

1130
00:41:50.108 --> 00:41:51.910
- You definitely
made an impression.

1131
00:41:51.977 --> 00:41:55.513
- Then on to step two.
humiliate the boyfriend.

1132
00:41:55.581 --> 00:41:57.482
- If you hate him. why did
you draw him so handsome?

1133
00:41:57.549 --> 00:41:59.050
- Because he's a gosh
darn snack. Lane.

1134
00:41:59.117 --> 00:42:00.952
I can't deny it any longer.
- Yeah.

1135
00:42:01.019 --> 00:42:02.788
- Hey. Rebecca Menderson
was cool enough to let me know

1136
00:42:02.854 --> 00:42:04.089
where Chuck and Claire
are going.

1137
00:42:04.155 --> 00:42:05.156
- And?
- You're going to love it.

1138
00:42:05.223 --> 00:42:06.357
- [gasp] It's the
ice skating rink?

1139
00:42:06.424 --> 00:42:07.726
- Ding. ding. ding.
- Yes. finally!

1140
00:42:07.793 --> 00:42:08.894
- Here we go.
Let's go.

1141
00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:10.729
- Wait. Hal. shoes!
- Oh!

1142
00:42:10.796 --> 00:42:12.330
Ugh.
- [laughing]

1143
00:42:12.397 --> 00:42:14.399
- I'm just--I'm just
making a snow angel.

1144
00:42:14.465 --> 00:42:16.067
I did that totally on purpose.
- Uh-huh.

1145
00:42:16.134 --> 00:42:18.203
Yeah.
- Yeah. yeah.

1146
00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:24.342
- You know. snow angels
are great and all.

1147
00:42:24.409 --> 00:42:27.278
but they kind of
break your heart.

1148
00:42:27.345 --> 00:42:28.680
- How come?

1149
00:42:28.747 --> 00:42:30.315
- Because it's all perfect.
but then you ruin it

1150
00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:33.018
with your handprint
when you get up to look at it.

1151
00:42:33.084 --> 00:42:35.220
- Yeah. true.

1152
00:42:35.286 --> 00:42:39.324
Hey. why do you love
ice skating so much?

1153
00:42:40.592 --> 00:42:42.160
- Honestly?

1154
00:42:42.227 --> 00:42:43.494
- Yeah.

1155
00:42:43.561 --> 00:42:44.562
- No.

1156
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:45.731
No. you'll think it's dumb.

1157
00:42:45.797 --> 00:42:48.634
- No. I won't.

1158
00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:49.901
- Okay.

1159
00:42:50.836 --> 00:42:52.971
When I'm ice skating...

1160
00:42:55.406 --> 00:42:56.507
- What?

1161
00:42:56.574 --> 00:42:57.542
- I don't know.

1162
00:42:57.609 --> 00:42:59.344
- Lane. it's just me.

1163
00:43:00.879 --> 00:43:03.181
- Okay. fine.

1164
00:43:03.248 --> 00:43:05.350
When I'm ice skating. I...

1165
00:43:05.416 --> 00:43:06.652
[small laugh]

1166
00:43:06.718 --> 00:43:10.521
I feel...beautiful.

1167
00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:13.058
- Oh. that is dumb.

1168
00:43:13.124 --> 00:43:14.592
- See? I told you--

1169
00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:18.229
- No. it's dumb because
you're already beautiful.

1170
00:43:18.296 --> 00:43:21.266
You're a beautiful girl.
Lane. like factually.

1171
00:43:22.634 --> 00:43:24.703
Here. so you don't
ruin your snow angel

1172
00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:26.872
with your handprint.

1173
00:43:26.938 --> 00:43:28.506
- [grunts]

1174
00:43:31.042 --> 00:43:32.210
- Perfect.

1175
00:43:35.681 --> 00:43:36.815
[gasps]

1176
00:43:36.882 --> 00:43:38.516
- You okay?

1177
00:43:38.583 --> 00:43:39.617
- Yeah.

1178
00:43:39.685 --> 00:43:42.654
Yeah. yeah. just.
you know. cold.

1179
00:43:43.321 --> 00:43:48.026
- Oh. well. I know how
much you love this sweater.

1180
00:43:48.093 --> 00:43:50.061
- No. no. no. no.
no. you'll be colder.

1181
00:43:50.128 --> 00:43:52.363
Are you crazy?

1182
00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:53.665
- Here.

1183
00:43:53.732 --> 00:43:55.100
- Thanks.

1184
00:43:55.166 --> 00:43:57.302
- Of course. let's go.
- Hal. wait.

1185
00:43:57.368 --> 00:43:59.237
- What?

1186
00:44:01.206 --> 00:44:02.974
- Did-did you do
something different

1187
00:44:03.041 --> 00:44:04.642
with your hair today?

1188
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:07.946
- Oh. no. I can assure you
this mess is whatever it is.

1189
00:44:08.013 --> 00:44:09.014
Let's go.

1190
00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:10.315
- I'll meet you there.

1191
00:44:10.381 --> 00:44:11.783
I just got to call
home real quick.

1192
00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:13.551
- Okay.
- Okay.

1193
00:44:21.092 --> 00:44:23.261
* Oh. no *

1194
00:44:23.328 --> 00:44:25.797
* What's this funny
feeling in my chest? *

1195
00:44:25.864 --> 00:44:29.034
* Like I know
there's a different warmth *

1196
00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:30.902
* For this than friends *

1197
00:44:30.969 --> 00:44:32.637
* Part of me says fight it *

1198
00:44:32.704 --> 00:44:35.941
* Part of me secretly
likes that *

1199
00:44:36.007 --> 00:44:38.276
* You see my beauty
when I can't *

1200
00:44:38.343 --> 00:44:41.980
* Okay. I said it
out loud to myself *

1201
00:44:42.047 --> 00:44:43.915
* It doesn't sound so crazy *

1202
00:44:43.982 --> 00:44:46.985
* Wait. maybe I can't tell *

1203
00:44:47.753 --> 00:44:51.957
* What if I told him
I could be falling? *

1204
00:44:52.023 --> 00:44:55.360
* I'm thinking what if.
what if it it's romance? *

1205
00:44:55.426 --> 00:44:58.263
* And it's got me wondering *

1206
00:44:58.329 --> 00:45:00.231
* How does this song end? *

1207
00:45:00.298 --> 00:45:01.833
* I'm thinking what if *

1208
00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:05.536
* What if
our story has a twist? *

1209
00:45:05.603 --> 00:45:07.372
* *

1210
00:45:07.438 --> 00:45:09.340
* Our story has a twist *

1211
00:45:09.407 --> 00:45:13.078
* Do I tell him I can't
look at him the same? *

1212
00:45:13.144 --> 00:45:14.712
* Yeah. I'll try *

1213
00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:17.615
* But suddenly I love
the things I hate *

1214
00:45:17.682 --> 00:45:19.584
* Like all these
ugly sweaters *

1215
00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:22.821
* I will wear them now
forever *

1216
00:45:22.888 --> 00:45:24.722
* Oh. what's happening to me? *

1217
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:28.359
* Okay. I said it
out loud to myself *

1218
00:45:28.426 --> 00:45:30.996
* Should I brush it off.
or should I tell him *

1219
00:45:31.062 --> 00:45:34.332
* How I really. really feel? *

1220
00:45:34.399 --> 00:45:37.936
* What if I told him
I could be falling? *

1221
00:45:38.003 --> 00:45:42.507
* I'm thinking what if.
what if it's romance and *

1222
00:45:42.573 --> 00:45:46.477
* It's got me wondering
how does this song end? *

1223
00:45:46.544 --> 00:45:50.916
* I'm thinking what if.
what if. what if *

1224
00:45:50.982 --> 00:45:54.920

Claire. you're so much cuter
than her.

00:52:25.743 --> 00:52:27.077
- Ugh!
- Are you okay?

1399
00:52:27.144 --> 00:52:29.079
- What happened?
- Where's Chuck going?

- Whoo!

1401
00:52:33.218 --> 00:52:35.686

went off without a hitch.

Okay.

Time for step three.
the grand gesture.

1406
00:52:44.929 --> 00:52:46.431
This step requires
actually talking to her.

1407
00:52:46.497 --> 00:52:48.533
so excuse me while I panic.

1408
00:52:48.599 --> 00:52:50.601
- Hal. you know you don't have
to do this much

1409
00:52:50.668 --> 00:52:52.069
for a girl to like you.
- Yes. I do.

1410
00:52:52.136 --> 00:52:56.173
- Trust me. you don't.
Regular Hal isn't so bad.

1411

awkward. but you're also--

[soft dramatic music]

1413

Do you remember
in second grade.

1414
00:53:04.815 --> 00:53:06.784
we went on the field trip
to the zoo?

1415
00:53:06.851 --> 00:53:08.953
- Oh. the whooping cranes.
- [laughs] Yes!

1416
00:53:09.019 --> 00:53:11.789
I was so irrationally scared
and started freaking out.

1417
00:53:11.856 --> 00:53:13.824
but before the other kids
could make fun of me.

1418
00:53:13.891 --> 00:53:15.993
you started saying.
"Whoop. whoop! I'm a crane!

1419
00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:18.162
Whoop. whoop!"
over and over.

1420
00:53:18.229 --> 00:53:19.697
- That was so embarrassing.

1421
00:53:19.764 --> 00:53:21.399
- So embarrassing.
[laughs]

1422
00:53:21.466 --> 00:53:27.104
But it distracted everyone
from me and also distracted me.

1423
00:53:27.171 --> 00:53:29.474
You were my hero.

1424
00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:35.380

Meet me at the soccer field
in an hour?

- Should I?

1429
00:53:46.891 --> 00:53:48.293
- I mean. he's kind of cute.

1430
00:53:48.359 --> 00:53:49.727
- And it would be a great way
to get back at Chuck.

- [chuckling]
Chuck is so hot.

to get with the program.

- Okay!
- [sighs] Yes!

01:00:46.476 --> 01:00:47.745
- Chuck. no.

1570
01:00:47.812 --> 01:00:49.279
- When I looked up this
Hal Brandston clown

1571
01:00:49.346 --> 01:00:51.048
in the yearbook. he's never
even been on a sports team.

1572
01:00:51.115 --> 01:00:52.649
like not even a fake sport
like golf.

1573
01:00:52.717 --> 01:00:53.818
- Now hold on a second.

1574
01:00:53.884 --> 01:00:55.219
- My point is
I'm Chuck Wheeler.

1575
01:00:55.285 --> 01:00:56.620
and you're Claire Bonner.

1576

The Chucks and the Claires

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:01.091
- Not on a snow day.

1579
01:01:01.158 --> 01:01:02.693
- What'd you say?
[Claire gasps]

1580
01:01:04.862 --> 01:01:07.031
- Meet me at the theater.
- Okay!

[dramatic music]

1582
01:01:09.133 --> 01:01:10.434

[horn blasting]

1587
01:01:20.577 --> 01:01:22.412
- Have you ever driven
without brakes before?

1588
01:01:22.479 --> 01:01:23.513
- No!

1589
01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:24.882
- Well. can you
drive any slower?

1590
01:01:24.949 --> 01:01:26.283
- [high-pitched
No!

1591
01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:27.818
- Well. how much longer
until the gas runs out?

1592
01:01:27.885 --> 01:01:29.586
- [normally] Oh. about two
hours unless we hit a building

1593
01:01:29.653 --> 01:01:32.522
or fall off a cliff because
you won't stop distracting me!

1595
01:01:34.058 --> 01:01:36.360
- I can't believe
you cut the brakes.

1596
01:01:36.426 --> 01:01:38.028
- I can't believe
you said no to sinkholes!

1597
01:01:38.095 --> 01:01:39.696
- I still say no to sinkholes!

1598
01:01:39.764 --> 01:01:41.031
All you do is sit there

1599
01:01:41.098 --> 01:01:43.633
in your huge. stupid.
puffy grandma coat

1600
01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:44.902
saying sinkholes. sinkholes.
sinkholes!

1601
01:01:44.969 --> 01:01:46.636
- It's not that huge!

1602
01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:49.073

an emergency landing on you.

1604
01:01:51.175 --> 01:01:53.343
which is exactly
what we're going to do.

- What?

1606
01:01:54.879 --> 01:01:57.114
- Three inches of down
under the coat. ten-foot drop.

1607
01:01:57.181 --> 01:01:58.949
- What are you doing?
- Math.

1608
01:01:59.016 --> 01:02:00.517
- Oh. my God. it is useful!

1609
01:02:00.584 --> 01:02:02.252
- Trudy. how fast
are we traveling?

1610
01:02:02.319 --> 01:02:03.854
- 41 miles per hour.

1611
01:02:03.921 --> 01:02:05.489
- Don't talk to my bird!

1612
01:02:05.555 --> 01:02:06.924
- Carry the two.

1613
01:02:06.991 --> 01:02:07.958
Yes!

- You're not landing on me!

1621
01:02:21.071 --> 01:02:22.372
- Fine!
Question. though.

1622
01:02:22.439 --> 01:02:23.941
Do you want to be the guy
that cut the wrong wire

1623
01:02:24.008 --> 01:02:26.777
or the guy that saved the day?

1624

Climb aboard.

Shut that door!

- Yes!
Sinkhole!

- Are you all right?

1639

- Do I look all right?

1640
01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:24.768
- I don't appreciate
that tone.

1641
01:03:24.835 --> 01:03:26.103
- I'm sorry. Trudy.

1642
01:03:26.170 --> 01:03:28.839

- Oh. man. Lane.

1648
01:03:38.248 --> 01:03:39.383
I just pushed Chuck
into a whale.

1649
01:03:39.449 --> 01:03:40.750
and then I stole
his snowmobile--

1650
01:03:40.817 --> 01:03:44.521
- Stop talking. okay?

1651
01:03:44.588 --> 01:03:48.358
You secretly pined after
someone for a long time.

1652
01:03:48.425 --> 01:03:50.760
And today.
instead of keeping it in.

1653
01:03:50.827 --> 01:03:53.063
you went after it
with a grand gesture.

1654
01:03:53.130 --> 01:03:57.968
You were bold because
it's a snow day.

1655

If I see you there
before the rink closes. great.

01:04:14.318 --> 01:04:17.354
And if I don't.
then I promise that tomorrow

1664
01:04:17.421 --> 01:04:20.090
is a new. normal day.

1665

Everything resets. right?

1666
01:04:22.859 --> 01:04:25.963

my pal. Hal.
whose shoes I tie

1668
01:04:29.133 --> 01:04:33.803

when you're nervous. too?

01:05:23.453 --> 01:05:25.489
- No. but I know you do.

1680
01:05:25.555 --> 01:05:27.424
so I always kept a pack on me

1681
01:05:27.491 --> 01:05:29.826
in case I ever got the chance
to offer you some.

1682
01:05:29.893 --> 01:05:31.095
- Wow.

1683
01:05:31.161 --> 01:05:32.629
- Yeah. challenging
to find year-round.

1684
01:05:32.696 --> 01:05:35.632
but I figured out a system
and--

[both chuckle]

1686
01:05:41.871 --> 01:05:45.742

01:05:45.809 --> 01:05:47.111
Wow. if I thought
I was going to get kissed

1688
01:05:47.177 --> 01:05:48.578
by two beautiful women today.

1689
01:05:48.645 --> 01:05:51.115
I would have worn
a better shirt.

- Two beautiful women?

1691
01:05:55.119 --> 01:05:57.754
- Oh. why did I say that
out loud?

1692
01:05:57.821 --> 01:05:59.356
I have this friend--

1693
01:05:59.423 --> 01:06:01.825
- Lane?
- How did you know?

1694
01:06:01.891 --> 01:06:04.128
- Because I'm a girl.

so much smarter than guys.

- Anyways. uh...

1699
01:06:13.203 --> 01:06:15.905
she kissed me.

1700
01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:19.876
And even though I never thought
about her in that way before.

1701
01:06:19.943 --> 01:06:24.581
now I kind of can't stop
thinking about her in that way.

And Lane knows me.
like. regular. old me.

1703
01:06:27.651 --> 01:06:31.455

she still likes me.

1706
01:06:36.026 --> 01:06:39.396
- Is it because she has
a longer neck than me?

1707
01:06:39.463 --> 01:06:42.032
- Oh. Claire. no.
your neck isn't short. okay?

1708
01:06:42.099 --> 01:06:44.834
And even if it was. no guy

because of her neck length.

the skating rink close?

- 5:00.
- Oh. I got to run.

before the rink
goes night-night.

And you know what that means?

1728
01:07:30.147 --> 01:07:32.982
That's right.
it's the couples-only skate.

1729

someone or get off the ice.

special someone. get off--

in front of my face *

you would come.
