3
00:04:37.653 --> 00:04:39.530
Anyone see him yet?

4
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:49.623
Are you crazy?

5
00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:56.547
Sounds like bad news
when you deliver it.

6
00:05:21.113 --> 00:05:23.282
I'm so proud of you!

7
00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:24.908
Finally together!

8
00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:17.646
Just a clogged pipe

9
00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:19.439
but I'm totally fine now.

10
00:07:41.962 --> 00:07:44.006
We're celebrating the first Reyes

11
00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:45.674
to graduate from college!

12
00:12:49.061 --> 00:12:50.646
Be my lookout.

13
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:16.889
I'm not sleepy either.

14
00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:27.042
Don't look so sad.

15
00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:55.863
See you in the morning.

16
00:20:52.753 --> 00:20:53.962
Come here!

17
00:20:54.046 --> 00:20:57.174
I forgot to give you a blessing!

18
00:25:26.777 --> 00:25:29.821
Open it!

19
00:25:40.624 --> 00:25:43.043
Looks like a bug. right?

20
00:27:24.978 --> 00:27:26.480
It went up his ass!

21
00:31:50.661 --> 00:31:53.121
How long ago did we take it?

22
00:33:42.981 --> 00:33:44.525
Why are you naked?

23
00:33:49.071 --> 00:33:50.155
Just like when he was little.

24
00:33:50.239 --> 00:33:51.865
Because he's cold!

25
00:33:51.949 --> 00:33:53.575
Cover your balls. Jaime.

26
00:34:17.599 --> 00:34:18.934
You okay?

27
00:36:35.821 --> 00:36:37.614
It's like Maria Mercedez.

28
00:36:37.698 --> 00:36:39.658
Only she's the rich white guy

29
00:36:39.741 --> 00:36:42.077
and he doesn't have a pot to piss in.

30
00:36:45.163 --> 00:36:46.456
Even better!

31
00:36:47.249 --> 00:36:49.418
I'm proud to say

32
00:36:49.543 --> 00:36:51.837
I'm Jaime from the neighborhood.

33
00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.839
He left his hometown

34
00:36:54.214 --> 00:36:57.551
to make a living.

35
00:37:14.359 --> 00:37:16.111
He took the Taco!

36
00:37:16.195 --> 00:37:18.071
Don't be silly!

37
00:39:19.943 --> 00:39:21.737
Gross! Cover that up!

38
00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.197
You can barely see it.

39
00:40:12.621 --> 00:40:14.456
Like the assassins in Mexico?

40
01:04:40.631 --> 01:04:41.673
Something wrong?

41
01:05:18.669 --> 01:05:20.337
Get away from the windows!

42
01:08:00.831 --> 01:08:01.999
Don't say anything.

43
01:09:43.517 --> 01:09:44.643
Hide!

44
01:13:54.476 --> 01:13:56.395
We have to help Jaime.

45
01:13:58.939 --> 01:14:02.484
We don't have time for self-pity.

46
01:14:03.318 --> 01:14:04.695
We must rescue Jaime.

47
01:14:05.028 --> 01:14:07.322
That's what his father would have wanted.

48
01:14:21.587 --> 01:14:23.297
Listen...

49
01:14:24.339 --> 01:14:26.717
I know how you feel

50
01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:28.719
but we have to be brave.

51
01:14:29.511 --> 01:14:31.138
There will be a time to cry.

52
01:14:31.597 --> 01:14:34.266
This is not that time.

53
01:14:36.894 --> 01:14:38.812
We have turned both cheeks.

54
01:14:38.896 --> 01:14:41.857
Now is the time to fight.

55
01:17:35.072 --> 01:17:37.241
This will make you feel better.

56
01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:45.207
We'll need more than a flying bug
to save Jaime.

57
01:18:51.106 --> 01:18:54.359
There's plenty you don't know
about your Nana.

58
01:19:12.127 --> 01:19:14.505
I've stormed this kind of fortress before.

59
01:19:19.676 --> 01:19:21.845
Let me see that tunnel.

60
01:19:24.515 --> 01:19:27.726
That's how we get in.

61
01:19:29.353 --> 01:19:31.813
We will create a diversion

62
01:19:31.897 --> 01:19:34.233
while they go in

63
01:19:34.316 --> 01:19:36.360
directly to the basement.

64
01:19:42.908 --> 01:19:45.619
After that. you go and find Jaime.

65
01:19:45.702 --> 01:19:48.205
We'll be the getaway.

66
01:19:48.622 --> 01:19:49.957
Any questions?

67
01:23:12.075 --> 01:23:13.035
I stepped on him!

68
01:27:14.109 --> 01:27:16.195
Everything is going to be okay.

69
01:28:00.364 --> 01:28:01.782
Come with me.

70
01:28:17.297 --> 01:28:19.800
The universe knows it's you.

71
01:28:20.092 --> 01:28:22.678
I know it's you.

72
01:28:22.761 --> 01:28:24.555
You know it as well.

73
01:28:55.210 --> 01:28:58.547
The scarab has chosen you for a reason.

74
01:29:19.693 --> 01:29:22.529
I'll always be with you.

75
01:29:25.741 --> 01:29:29.036
All the answers are here.

76
01:29:39.463 --> 01:29:40.964
I love you. son.

77
01:35:05.205 --> 01:35:06.790
Come on.

78
01:35:11.295 --> 01:35:12.254
I'll tell you later.

79
01:35:40.032 --> 01:35:42.159
Down with the imperialists!

80
01:35:53.212 --> 01:35:54.505
Now we can go.

81
01:36:46.723 --> 01:36:47.724
You ok?

82
01:37:27.097 --> 01:37:30.475
And kick their asses!

83
01:38:18.774 --> 01:38:20.734
Let's kick their ass.

84
01:39:52.201 --> 01:39:53.785
Where were you?

85
01:44:32.147 --> 01:44:33.398
Take these!

86
01:46:21.757 --> 01:46:23.050
Me too.

87
01:51:00.994 --> 01:51:02.663
Take care of your family.

88
01:51:02.996 --> 01:51:03.705
Go.

89
01:51:34.027 --> 01:51:38.240
I remember everything now.

90
01:52:00.470 --> 01:52:01.638
It's time...

91
01:52:10.856 --> 01:52:12.858
Time to come home.

92
01:53:51.081 --> 01:53:52.791
Bad weed never dies.

93
01:54:02.676 --> 01:54:04.386
Now we can cry.

94
01:55:37.771 --> 01:55:39.690
Everybody showed up.

95
01:56:34.578 --> 01:56:36.663
Now we can start to rebuild.

96
01:56:53.972 --> 01:56:55.641
Thank you for coming.
