3
00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:20.858
Are we there yet?

4
00:03:23.326 --> 00:03:25.227
Not yet.

5
00:03:25.261 --> 00:03:26.430
Almost.

6
00:03:29.531 --> 00:03:30.867
I'm not having this
conversation.

7
00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:32.468
Theo's in the car.

8
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:33.737
You need to come back.

9
00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.471
- No.
- Allison.

10
00:03:35.505 --> 00:03:36.806
you have to come back.

11
00:03:36.838 --> 00:03:38.441
I'm not coming back.

12
00:03:39.676 --> 00:03:41.644
We're never coming back.

13
00:03:41.677 --> 00:03:42.578
Stop.

14
00:03:42.612 --> 00:03:44.914
Allison. come back now for
Theo's sake.

15
00:03:44.947 --> 00:03:46.183
For Theo's sake?

16
00:03:46.215 --> 00:03:47.617
I'm protecting him.

17
00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:48.551
Protecting him?

18
00:03:48.584 --> 00:03:50.452
Allison. you can't even take
care of him.

19
00:03:50.486 --> 00:03:52.388
You can barely take care of
yourself.

20
00:03:55.325 --> 00:03:56.760
Fuck you.

21
00:03:56.792 --> 00:03:58.327
Allison. you're not doing well.

22
00:03:58.361 --> 00:03:59.696
Let me help you.

23
00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:00.564
I'm fine.

24
00:04:00.596 --> 00:04:01.564
Theo's fine.

25
00:04:01.598 --> 00:04:02.565
We're fine.

26
00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:03.566
You know you
shouldn't be doing this.

27
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.434
Tell me where you are.

28
00:04:04.468 --> 00:04:06.403
For the last time. leave us
alone.

29
00:04:29.691 --> 00:04:31.828
Are we there yet?

30
00:04:38.934 --> 00:04:40.504
You can do this. Allison.

31
00:04:45.908 --> 00:04:47.376
You can do this.

32
00:04:51.446 --> 00:04:52.715
You can do this.

33
00:05:55.744 --> 00:05:56.744
Hello?

34
00:05:58.747 --> 00:05:59.747
Hello?

35
00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.720
Hello?

36
00:06:06.723 --> 00:06:07.723
Wait here.

37
00:06:08.725 --> 00:06:09.725
Hi.

38
00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:11.360
You must be Allison key.

39
00:06:11.393 --> 00:06:12.095
I'm George.

40
00:06:12.127 --> 00:06:12.995
Nice to meet you.

41
00:06:13.028 --> 00:06:13.862
Hi.

42
00:06:13.896 --> 00:06:14.730
Yes.

43
00:06:14.763 --> 00:06:15.898
And this is Theo.

44
00:06:15.932 --> 00:06:17.066
Oh.

45
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.769
Do you like candy. hm?

46
00:06:20.802 --> 00:06:21.802
Here you go.

47
00:06:22.704 --> 00:06:23.973
Oh. no?

48
00:06:24.641 --> 00:06:27.076
I thought we could be friends.

49
00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:28.578
I'm sorry.

50
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.379
He can be shy around new people.

51
00:06:31.614 --> 00:06:32.849
Ah. that's all right.

52
00:06:32.881 --> 00:06:33.550
Come on.

53
00:06:33.583 --> 00:06:34.917
I'll give you the 10 cent tour.

54
00:06:37.018 --> 00:06:38.018
Theo.

55
00:06:41.424 --> 00:06:42.424
Come on.

56
00:06:44.893 --> 00:06:45.893
Oh.

57
00:06:47.829 --> 00:06:50.666
Right down here is the basement.

58
00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:52.368
It's great for storage.

59
00:06:52.401 --> 00:06:55.838
And I bet you could make an
amazing fort right down there.

60
00:06:56.506 --> 00:06:58.408
And moving on.

61
00:07:11.086 --> 00:07:12.088
The living room.

62
00:07:19.461 --> 00:07:21.997
Oh. you were so desperate to
move in

63
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.701
that the cleaning crew hasn't
been in yet.

64
00:07:28.069 --> 00:07:29.069
Or ever.

65
00:07:38.146 --> 00:07:39.146
Dining room.

66
00:07:40.516 --> 00:07:42.552
And. well. this.

67
00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:48.758
And this is my favorite
room in the entire house.

68
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:51.194
Now. I'm sure that you can
agree that with a kitchen

69
00:07:51.227 --> 00:07:55.699
like this. that this will
be the heart of your home.

70
00:07:57.133 --> 00:08:01.905
And your son and yourself
will have many fond memories.

71
00:08:02.537 --> 00:08:05.574
There's a problem with the
stove.

72
00:08:05.607 --> 00:08:08.511
and I'll have a handyman come
have a look.

73
00:08:08.544 --> 00:08:11.415
And he'll spray for bugs too.
right?

74
00:08:12.915 --> 00:08:13.917
I'll look into it.

75
00:08:14.984 --> 00:08:20.457
Well. I'm sure you wanna get
settled. so I'll be going.

76
00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:29.530
Oh.

77
00:08:30.966 --> 00:08:34.771
Allison key. you're gonna need
this.

78
00:08:39.876 --> 00:08:41.977
Aw. sweetie.

79
00:08:42.011 --> 00:08:44.680
I know this place can be
overwhelming.

80
00:08:45.548 --> 00:08:46.750
but give it a few days.

81
00:08:52.554 --> 00:08:53.957
You're gonna feel much better.

82
00:09:26.756 --> 00:09:28.257
Mommy.

83
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:29.290
Theo?

84
00:09:30.626 --> 00:09:31.626
Theo?

85
00:09:32.761 --> 00:09:33.929
Theo?

86
00:09:33.963 --> 00:09:35.030
Theo?

87
00:09:50.579 --> 00:09:52.081
Isn't this funny?

88
00:09:58.054 --> 00:09:59.689
Yes. this is funny.

89
00:10:03.092 --> 00:10:05.061
There you go. my lady.

90
00:10:05.093 --> 00:10:06.795
Thank you. my lord.

91
00:10:06.828 --> 00:10:09.665
You're welcome. your highness.

92
00:10:17.106 --> 00:10:20.010
Are you okay. mommy?

93
00:10:20.977 --> 00:10:22.913
I just need some air.

94
00:11:51.333 --> 00:11:53.969
I'll go get the bags. then
I'll make dinner. sport.

95
00:13:10.011 --> 00:13:11.011
Hello?

96
00:13:18.053 --> 00:13:20.123
Okay. time for bed.

97
00:13:21.824 --> 00:13:23.492
But it's only eight o'clock.

98
00:13:23.525 --> 00:13:25.828
But it's late enough.

99
00:13:25.861 --> 00:13:27.429
But I want to explore.

100
00:13:27.463 --> 00:13:29.799
And you can explore more
tomorrow.

101
00:13:35.036 --> 00:13:35.905
Please?

102
00:13:35.938 --> 00:13:36.938
No.

103
00:13:41.376 --> 00:13:42.344
Please?

104
00:13:42.377 --> 00:13:43.780
Come on.

105
00:13:55.256 --> 00:13:56.258
There we go.

106
00:13:56.659 --> 00:14:00.163
There you go. buddy. just
as snug as a bug in a rug.

107
00:14:00.195 --> 00:14:02.964
Are bugs actually snug in rugs?

108
00:14:02.997 --> 00:14:04.900
That is a great question.

109
00:14:04.934 --> 00:14:05.568
I don't know.

110
00:14:05.601 --> 00:14:07.136
It's just a saying.

111
00:14:07.169 --> 00:14:08.804
All right. lights out. slugger.

112
00:14:13.876 --> 00:14:15.410
Can you please check my room?

113
00:14:16.612 --> 00:14:17.612
Of course.

114
00:14:20.348 --> 00:14:21.516
Where should I begin?

115
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:23.152
Check under the bed.

116
00:14:24.053 --> 00:14:25.053
Under the bed.

117
00:14:27.122 --> 00:14:30.526
No monsters here. I am happy to
report.

118
00:14:32.594 --> 00:14:34.329
Check behind the curtains.

119
00:14:34.362 --> 00:14:35.497
- The curtains?
- Yes.

120
00:14:39.868 --> 00:14:41.403
No monsters there either.

121
00:14:44.073 --> 00:14:45.241
Check the closet.

122
00:14:45.274 --> 00:14:49.445
The closet. that's a good
place for a monster to hide.

123
00:14:58.887 --> 00:15:00.889
Well. monsters would get stuck
in there.

124
00:15:10.131 --> 00:15:12.401
I dutifully report no monsters.

125
00:15:19.174 --> 00:15:20.876
No monster. just a bottle.

126
00:15:24.413 --> 00:15:25.413
It can't hurt you.

127
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:39.628
The only monster here is a
tickle monster.

128
00:15:39.661 --> 00:15:40.495
Stop.

129
00:15:40.529 --> 00:15:41.529
Stop.

130
00:15:42.665 --> 00:15:43.366
All right.

131
00:15:43.399 --> 00:15:45.101
- Ready for lights out?
- Yes.

132
00:15:45.133 --> 00:15:45.867
All right.

133
00:15:45.901 --> 00:15:47.302
- I love you.
- I love you too.

134
00:16:12.627 --> 00:16:14.362
Hey. buddy.

135
00:16:14.396 --> 00:16:16.498
I know it's late. but we gotta
go get mom.

136
00:16:17.466 --> 00:16:18.466
Again?

137
00:16:20.368 --> 00:16:21.368
Yeah. I know.

138
00:16:22.304 --> 00:16:23.238
But it'll be short this time.

139
00:16:23.271 --> 00:16:26.074
and you'll be back in your bed
in no time.

140
00:16:29.311 --> 00:16:32.581
I got something that'll cheer
you up.

141
00:16:47.161 --> 00:16:50.465
I got this on our last trip to
Rochester.

142
00:16:51.567 --> 00:16:53.402
You know I love you. right?

143
00:16:53.434 --> 00:16:54.636
I'll always be there for you.

144
00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:57.173
Even if I can't. this guy will.
okay?

145
00:17:01.709 --> 00:17:03.378
All right. let's go get mom now.

146
00:17:13.055 --> 00:17:14.332
It's always someone else's
fault.

147
00:17:14.356 --> 00:17:16.325
I don't wanna have this fight
again.

148
00:17:16.357 --> 00:17:18.626
I'm tired of having the
same conversation with you.

149
00:17:18.659 --> 00:17:20.562
They aren't your friends.

150
00:17:20.596 --> 00:17:21.664
The school called.

151
00:17:21.696 --> 00:17:23.507
I'm tired of having the
same conversation with you.

152
00:17:23.531 --> 00:17:25.100
You're a mean. aren't your
friends.

153
00:17:25.134 --> 00:17:26.035
The school called.

154
00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:28.104
It's always someone else's fault
with you.

155
00:17:28.136 --> 00:17:29.304
- You're a mean... mommy!

156
00:17:32.107 --> 00:17:33.107
Mommy!

157
00:17:36.578 --> 00:17:38.982
Mommy. mommy. mommy. mommy!

158
00:17:41.482 --> 00:17:43.219
Mommy. mommy. mommy!

159
00:17:50.392 --> 00:17:52.228
What happened?

160
00:17:52.261 --> 00:17:53.529
I had a nightmare.

161
00:17:55.097 --> 00:17:55.731
I'm sorry.

162
00:17:55.763 --> 00:17:57.198
That must've been awful.

163
00:17:57.232 --> 00:17:58.232
It was.

164
00:17:59.334 --> 00:18:00.703
Do you wanna talk about it?

165
00:18:01.537 --> 00:18:06.675
We were in the car. not
this one. the old one.

166
00:18:06.707 --> 00:18:08.209
He was there.

167
00:18:08.242 --> 00:18:09.444
He was mad.

168
00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:12.515
Then. he was gone.

169
00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:15.751
Then. I woke up.

170
00:18:18.553 --> 00:18:20.589
It was just a dream. I promise.

171
00:18:23.591 --> 00:18:24.793
It was so real.

172
00:18:26.127 --> 00:18:28.396
You want me to sleep with you
tonight?

173
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:31.367
Okay.

174
00:18:35.671 --> 00:18:36.671
Come here.

175
00:19:10.539 --> 00:19:11.540
Hey.

176
00:19:11.572 --> 00:19:12.407
We need to talk.

177
00:19:12.441 --> 00:19:13.309
You need to come back.

178
00:19:13.341 --> 00:19:14.242
No.

179
00:19:14.276 --> 00:19:15.077
Leave us alone.

180
00:19:15.109 --> 00:19:18.113
Allison. you cannot outrun this.

181
00:19:18.146 --> 00:19:18.880
Come home.

182
00:19:18.914 --> 00:19:20.816
I'm never coming back.

183
00:19:20.848 --> 00:19:22.650
Tell me where you are.

184
00:19:22.684 --> 00:19:24.353
Never.

185
00:19:24.386 --> 00:19:26.321
Allison. I care about you.

186
00:19:26.355 --> 00:19:27.390
I'll come get you.

187
00:19:28.322 --> 00:19:30.191
I'll bring you back.

188
00:19:30.224 --> 00:19:31.394
Leave me alone.

189
00:19:38.533 --> 00:19:39.635
Morning. sunshine.

190
00:19:41.369 --> 00:19:42.369
Good morning.

191
00:19:48.176 --> 00:19:50.378
Mommy. I don't understand this.

192
00:19:52.513 --> 00:19:53.513
Let me see.

193
00:19:57.351 --> 00:19:59.521
Hoo. well. that's a tough one.

194
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.891
I don't get it.

195
00:20:01.924 --> 00:20:02.758
He's huge.

196
00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:05.160
Why does he not run?

197
00:20:05.194 --> 00:20:06.395
When elephants are small.

198
00:20:06.427 --> 00:20:08.396
they put a big chain around
their foot.

199
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:11.567
and it's stuck in a stake in the
ground.

200
00:20:11.599 --> 00:20:16.539
and try as they might. and
they do 'cause they're young

201
00:20:16.571 --> 00:20:20.309
and strong. they're just
not big enough to break it.

202
00:20:20.341 --> 00:20:21.486
So. by the time they're that
big.

203
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:25.213
it doesn't matter if it's
just a little piece of rope.

204
00:20:25.246 --> 00:20:29.251
they just don't try to get away
anymore.

205
00:20:30.719 --> 00:20:32.421
His spirit's broken.

206
00:20:32.453 --> 00:20:34.857
He just doesn't have a
reason to fight anymore.

207
00:20:36.625 --> 00:20:38.861
Poor elephant. he's trapped
forever.

208
00:20:47.735 --> 00:20:49.972
What do you say we go explore?

209
00:20:50.004 --> 00:20:51.004
Yes.

210
00:21:22.337 --> 00:21:24.473
Ready or not. here I come.

211
00:21:29.344 --> 00:21:32.815
Where could he be?

212
00:21:33.948 --> 00:21:35.684
Got you.

213
00:21:37.519 --> 00:21:38.621
Your turn to count. okay?

214
00:21:39.988 --> 00:21:41.557
No peeking.

215
00:21:41.589 --> 00:21:42.589
Meow.

216
00:21:45.993 --> 00:21:48.897
Did you really just put that
there?

217
00:21:52.466 --> 00:21:53.434
One.

218
00:21:53.467 --> 00:21:54.469
Two.

219
00:21:54.502 --> 00:21:55.637
Three.

220
00:21:55.671 --> 00:21:56.838
Four.

221
00:21:56.871 --> 00:21:57.705
Five.

222
00:21:57.739 --> 00:21:58.707
Six.

223
00:21:58.740 --> 00:21:59.907
Seven.

224
00:21:59.941 --> 00:22:00.843
Eight.

225
00:22:00.876 --> 00:22:01.710
Nine.

226
00:22:01.742 --> 00:22:02.742
10.

227
00:22:04.879 --> 00:22:05.880
Here I come.

228
00:22:07.316 --> 00:22:08.451
There you are.

229
00:22:09.885 --> 00:22:11.020
There you are.

230
00:22:16.425 --> 00:22:17.559
I got you now.

231
00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:23.699
I'll get you next time.

232
00:22:25.533 --> 00:22:26.434
Will you do me a favor and wait

233
00:22:26.469 --> 00:22:28.771
in the dining room while I check
the door?

234
00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:30.570
Thank you.

235
00:22:42.384 --> 00:22:43.384
Just a minute.

236
00:22:50.959 --> 00:22:51.959
Who is it?

237
00:22:53.595 --> 00:22:55.864
Ma'am. my name is Jack Turner.

238
00:22:55.896 --> 00:22:56.898
I'm the handyman.

239
00:22:56.932 --> 00:22:58.034
Your landlord sent me.

240
00:22:59.401 --> 00:23:00.469
What are you here for?

241
00:23:00.501 --> 00:23:02.870
George said something
about your heat not working.

242
00:23:02.904 --> 00:23:04.006
and that you got bugs.

243
00:23:09.845 --> 00:23:10.679
Hi.

244
00:23:10.713 --> 00:23:12.514
- Good morning. ma'am.
- Come on in.

245
00:23:18.587 --> 00:23:19.754
I'm Jack.

246
00:23:19.788 --> 00:23:20.455
Allison.

247
00:23:20.489 --> 00:23:21.990
And please don't call me ma'am.

248
00:23:22.022 --> 00:23:23.022
No problem.

249
00:23:34.069 --> 00:23:36.372
Oh. shit. I am sorry.

250
00:23:36.405 --> 00:23:38.406
I'll help you clean up the
broken glass.

251
00:23:39.741 --> 00:23:41.609
That must've been here from
before.

252
00:23:59.994 --> 00:24:01.097
Here. I'll take that.

253
00:24:02.196 --> 00:24:03.799
George said you needed the place
quickly.

254
00:24:03.831 --> 00:24:06.635
but he's usually pretty good
about keeping it in order.

255
00:24:07.601 --> 00:24:08.803
Really?

256
00:24:08.837 --> 00:24:10.046
Yeah. the last tenants just up
and left

257
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:11.674
in the middle of the night.

258
00:24:12.407 --> 00:24:15.410
It's a pretty sad story all
around.

259
00:24:15.444 --> 00:24:16.444
What happened?

260
00:24:17.745 --> 00:24:20.549
A man moved in here
with his little girl.

261
00:24:20.581 --> 00:24:22.984
I think he was a scientist or
something.

262
00:24:23.018 --> 00:24:26.856
But he was pretty much out of
it by the time he moved in.

263
00:24:28.223 --> 00:24:30.158
His little girl was
diagnosed with brain cancer.

264
00:24:30.192 --> 00:24:31.493
Ugh. that's horrible.

265
00:24:32.494 --> 00:24:36.799
Yeah. I mean. this man
tried everything to cure her.

266
00:24:36.831 --> 00:24:39.534
He moved here for the children's
hospital down the road.

267
00:24:39.568 --> 00:24:41.703
He tried everything. and nothing
worked.

268
00:24:43.637 --> 00:24:45.174
God. what do you think happened?

269
00:24:48.976 --> 00:24:52.213
George said something
about them moving to Mexico

270
00:24:52.246 --> 00:24:53.981
as a last-ditch effort.

271
00:24:54.014 --> 00:24:57.018
Something about scorpion
venom curing cancer?

272
00:24:57.051 --> 00:24:58.619
Scorpion venom?

273
00:24:58.653 --> 00:25:00.055
Yeah. I don't know.

274
00:25:00.088 --> 00:25:02.857
I met him a couple
times. but the last times

275
00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:05.726
that he was here. that's
all he talked about.

276
00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.063
I think he just kinda
started losing his mind

277
00:25:08.096 --> 00:25:10.031
as his daughter got sicker and
sicker.

278
00:25:11.566 --> 00:25:13.168
Here. let's get rid of this.

279
00:25:13.201 --> 00:25:15.004
and we'll get the rest in a
minute.

280
00:25:21.209 --> 00:25:23.479
Well. I hope they're doing okay.

281
00:25:24.212 --> 00:25:25.212
I really do.

282
00:25:25.981 --> 00:25:27.683
Yeah. I do too.

283
00:25:29.917 --> 00:25:32.154
Well. look who decided to join
us.

284
00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.155
Who are you?

285
00:25:35.155 --> 00:25:37.926
Theo. this is...

286
00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:39.960
Jack.

287
00:25:41.296 --> 00:25:42.565
It's nice to meet you.

288
00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.200
Say hello.

289
00:25:47.636 --> 00:25:48.270
I'm sorry.

290
00:25:48.302 --> 00:25:49.704
He can be so shy.

291
00:25:49.738 --> 00:25:50.572
It's okay.

292
00:25:50.605 --> 00:25:51.640
I was a shy kid too.

293
00:25:54.742 --> 00:25:56.979
That must've been here.

294
00:25:57.011 --> 00:25:58.113
Right. must've been.

295
00:25:59.614 --> 00:26:01.183
When is the cleaning crew
coming?

296
00:26:01.849 --> 00:26:03.685
They should be here tomorrow.

297
00:26:04.586 --> 00:26:05.521
Not fast enough.

298
00:26:05.553 --> 00:26:07.555
What do you say we start
with the bugs. huh?

299
00:26:07.588 --> 00:26:09.058
I hate bugs.

300
00:26:10.559 --> 00:26:11.559
Yes. ma'am.

301
00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:14.029
Um. not ma'am.

302
00:26:14.061 --> 00:26:15.497
Please call me Allison.

303
00:27:07.982 --> 00:27:09.850
So. there's a small crack
right there.

304
00:27:09.884 --> 00:27:12.120
I'll spray it and then patch it
up.

305
00:27:12.153 --> 00:27:13.956
Looks big enough for a
cockroach.

306
00:27:16.657 --> 00:27:18.126
So. how old was the girl?

307
00:27:19.293 --> 00:27:20.293
The sick girl?

308
00:27:21.629 --> 00:27:23.331
Probably a little bit older than
your son.

309
00:27:27.368 --> 00:27:31.839
I can't imagine what that
poor father was going through.

310
00:28:32.966 --> 00:28:35.436
It looks like they burrowed
through the baseboard.

311
00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:37.739
So. timeline on fixing that?

312
00:28:37.771 --> 00:28:39.174
It should be done tomorrow.

313
00:28:39.206 --> 00:28:40.274
Let me out. let me out.

314
00:28:40.308 --> 00:28:42.211
- Theo?
- Mommy. mommy. help.

315
00:28:43.411 --> 00:28:45.780
Help. help. help. help.

316
00:28:45.813 --> 00:28:47.148
Theo?

317
00:28:47.182 --> 00:28:48.183
- Theo?
- Help.

318
00:28:48.616 --> 00:28:50.685
I'm coming. hang on.

319
00:28:51.251 --> 00:28:52.251
Help

320
00:28:52.488 --> 00:28:53.989
- ma'am.
- Allison.

321
00:28:55.723 --> 00:28:57.126
- I'm right here.
- Help.

322
00:28:57.992 --> 00:28:58.992
Hang on. Theo.

323
00:29:00.261 --> 00:29:02.431
- Help. help.
- Theo. I'm right here.

324
00:29:03.464 --> 00:29:04.464
Hang in there.

325
00:29:06.467 --> 00:29:08.102
You're okay.

326
00:29:08.136 --> 00:29:09.405
You're okay now.

327
00:29:11.205 --> 00:29:12.205
I know.

328
00:29:29.156 --> 00:29:31.193
Don't go down there.

329
00:29:31.225 --> 00:29:32.260
It's okay. buddy.

330
00:29:32.292 --> 00:29:34.328
I'm just gonna go take a look.

331
00:29:34.361 --> 00:29:36.098
There's something down there.

332
00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:38.366
You have a fierce grip.

333
00:29:38.398 --> 00:29:39.410
I'm just gonna take a look.

334
00:29:39.434 --> 00:29:40.268
Please don't.

335
00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:41.435
I heard something.

336
00:29:41.469 --> 00:29:42.771
It's an old house.

337
00:29:42.803 --> 00:29:43.938
It's probably just settling.

338
00:29:43.972 --> 00:29:45.473
Something was moving.

339
00:29:45.507 --> 00:29:47.342
It was probably just a bug.

340
00:29:47.375 --> 00:29:49.511
It was bigger than a bug.

341
00:29:49.543 --> 00:29:51.479
It was probably a really big
bug.

342
00:29:53.047 --> 00:29:54.049
Come on.

343
00:29:54.081 --> 00:29:55.751
Theo.

344
00:29:55.783 --> 00:29:56.783
I'll make cocoa.

345
00:30:03.223 --> 00:30:04.960
Come on. I'll make you some
cocoa.

346
00:31:58.039 --> 00:32:00.142
I wanted marshmallows.

347
00:32:54.494 --> 00:32:55.996
Are you all right?

348
00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:57.098
It was just a rat.

349
00:32:57.832 --> 00:33:00.401
Don't worry. I'll take care of
it.

350
00:33:00.434 --> 00:33:01.470
I have to get a cage.

351
00:33:41.242 --> 00:33:42.978
Spaghetti or soup?

352
00:33:51.685 --> 00:33:53.021
Spaghetti or soup?

353
00:33:54.055 --> 00:33:55.055
Neither.

354
00:33:58.559 --> 00:33:59.728
What is this?

355
00:33:59.761 --> 00:34:00.761
That's not right.

356
00:34:03.731 --> 00:34:05.166
It looks more like that.

357
00:34:08.536 --> 00:34:10.205
But what is it?

358
00:34:10.238 --> 00:34:12.040
That's the thing in the
basement.

359
00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:13.941
No.

360
00:34:13.975 --> 00:34:16.178
Jack said it's just a rat in the
basement.

361
00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:19.146
These don't look rats.

362
00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:21.182
It's way bigger than a rat.

363
00:34:21.214 --> 00:34:23.151
So. it's not a rat.

364
00:34:23.184 --> 00:34:25.586
Maybe with a little imagination.

365
00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:28.455
that's what a rat could look
like.

366
00:34:28.488 --> 00:34:33.494
but this is far scarier than
just a rat in the basement.

367
00:34:34.428 --> 00:34:35.564
I know what I saw.

368
00:36:05.153 --> 00:36:06.153
Help!

369
00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:12.693
Mommy. mommy. mommy. mommy!

370
00:36:12.727 --> 00:36:13.727
Help!

371
00:36:14.162 --> 00:36:15.296
Help!

372
00:36:23.504 --> 00:36:24.504
Help!

373
00:36:25.872 --> 00:36:27.608
Mommy. mommy. mommy!

374
00:36:30.443 --> 00:36:31.443
Help!

375
00:36:32.713 --> 00:36:34.883
Mommy. mommy. mommy. mommy!

376
00:36:43.256 --> 00:36:44.256
Help!

377
00:36:53.868 --> 00:36:54.802
What happened?

378
00:36:54.834 --> 00:36:57.171
The monster was here.

379
00:36:59.941 --> 00:37:01.910
There's a monster?

380
00:37:01.943 --> 00:37:04.444
Oh my god. what happened?

381
00:37:04.477 --> 00:37:06.380
The monster was here.

382
00:37:07.847 --> 00:37:08.481
Come on.

383
00:37:08.515 --> 00:37:10.684
We gotta get you cleaned up.

384
00:37:27.702 --> 00:37:29.638
Theo.

385
00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:31.271
Theo. please let me in.

386
00:37:31.305 --> 00:37:33.575
You never protect me.

387
00:37:33.607 --> 00:37:36.310
I'll protect myself.

388
00:37:36.343 --> 00:37:37.244
Please.

389
00:37:37.278 --> 00:37:38.278
No.

390
00:37:41.448 --> 00:37:42.082
Fine.

391
00:37:42.117 --> 00:37:43.584
Then. I'll sleep right here.

392
00:38:49.617 --> 00:38:51.452
Hey. come sit here. sweetie.

393
00:39:06.033 --> 00:39:08.502
I want to go home.

394
00:39:08.535 --> 00:39:09.604
We are home.

395
00:39:09.636 --> 00:39:11.872
I don't like it here.

396
00:39:12.772 --> 00:39:15.443
Well. you're just gonna
have to get used to it.

397
00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:17.778
I want to leave.

398
00:39:18.778 --> 00:39:20.013
We can't leave.

399
00:39:20.046 --> 00:39:21.615
Where would we go anyway?

400
00:39:21.649 --> 00:39:23.851
We don't have anywhere to go.

401
00:39:23.883 --> 00:39:25.352
What about grandma's?

402
00:39:26.687 --> 00:39:27.955
We can't go to grandma's.

403
00:39:28.955 --> 00:39:29.955
Why?

404
00:39:30.191 --> 00:39:31.893
Because it's complicated.

405
00:39:33.861 --> 00:39:35.730
I hate this place.

406
00:40:02.622 --> 00:40:04.024
That's a pretty big cage.

407
00:40:04.057 --> 00:40:05.859
It's a pretty big rat.

408
00:40:05.892 --> 00:40:07.561
Hoo. uh. well. good luck.

409
00:40:07.595 --> 00:40:08.562
We're gonna head out for a bit.

410
00:40:08.595 --> 00:40:10.373
If you can just lock up
when you leave. please.

411
00:40:10.397 --> 00:40:11.397
Will do.

412
00:40:15.836 --> 00:40:16.971
Hey. Theo?

413
00:40:18.037 --> 00:40:19.073
Come on. Theo.

414
00:40:19.973 --> 00:40:20.973
No.

415
00:40:22.709 --> 00:40:23.543
Come on.

416
00:40:23.577 --> 00:40:24.577
We'll go to the park.

417
00:40:30.484 --> 00:40:31.686
Leave me alone.

418
00:40:32.952 --> 00:40:34.021
It'll be fun.

419
00:40:38.658 --> 00:40:39.861
We'll get ice cream.

420
00:41:01.115 --> 00:41:03.785
We're going in the car again?

421
00:41:21.769 --> 00:41:22.971
What is that?

422
00:41:30.678 --> 00:41:31.980
What the fuck?

423
00:42:03.877 --> 00:42:04.877
Allison?

424
00:42:05.513 --> 00:42:07.048
Allison key?

425
00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:07.914
Kyra.

426
00:42:07.948 --> 00:42:09.083
Nurse Kyra.

427
00:42:09.115 --> 00:42:10.184
How you doing?

428
00:42:11.852 --> 00:42:13.721
I'm fine. thanks.

429
00:42:16.122 --> 00:42:18.492
Wow. Theo is really looking
good.

430
00:42:19.292 --> 00:42:20.595
He's really grown.

431
00:42:23.296 --> 00:42:25.899
Did you ever get in contact
with that person I recommended?

432
00:42:25.932 --> 00:42:28.935
I mean. it's just what
you've been through. it's...

433
00:42:28.968 --> 00:42:30.070
I'm fine.

434
00:42:30.104 --> 00:42:31.004
We're fine.

435
00:42:31.037 --> 00:42:32.037
Thank you.

436
00:42:33.173 --> 00:42:34.173
Theo?

437
00:42:35.109 --> 00:42:37.645
Allison. it wasn't your fault.

438
00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:41.782
Leave us alone.

439
00:42:41.814 --> 00:42:42.814
Theo.

440
00:42:45.019 --> 00:42:46.254
Let's go home. buddy.

441
00:43:28.162 --> 00:43:31.232
I still don't know why we had
to leave.

442
00:43:31.265 --> 00:43:33.234
We discussed this in the car.

443
00:43:33.267 --> 00:43:36.136
It's because you wanted to
leave.

444
00:43:36.169 --> 00:43:38.939
You only think about yourself.

445
00:43:38.972 --> 00:43:39.973
Don't point.

446
00:43:40.874 --> 00:43:42.109
And that is not true.

447
00:43:42.877 --> 00:43:45.113
Then tell me who the woman was.

448
00:43:46.981 --> 00:43:48.049
It was a long time ago.

449
00:43:48.082 --> 00:43:49.050
It doesn't matter.

450
00:43:49.082 --> 00:43:50.251
Who is she?

451
00:44:18.912 --> 00:44:19.912
Jack?

452
00:44:22.783 --> 00:44:24.251
Hello?

453
00:44:24.283 --> 00:44:25.283
Jack.

454
00:44:48.408 --> 00:44:49.611
You can do this.

455
00:45:00.453 --> 00:45:01.923
You can do this.

456
00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.801
Jack?

457
00:45:15.068 --> 00:45:16.403
Hello?

458
00:45:16.669 --> 00:45:17.738
Jack.

459
00:45:39.292 --> 00:45:40.292
Hi. Eleanor.

460
00:45:42.229 --> 00:45:43.931
I didn't know if you'd pick up.

461
00:45:44.932 --> 00:45:46.332
Wasn't sure I could.

462
00:45:46.365 --> 00:45:47.365
How's Theo?

463
00:45:49.903 --> 00:45:50.903
He's fine.

464
00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:55.309
Where are you?

465
00:45:55.341 --> 00:45:56.977
You know I can't tell you that.

466
00:45:57.010 --> 00:45:58.778
Allison. you need to come back.

467
00:45:58.812 --> 00:46:01.115
You need to bring Theo back.

468
00:46:02.149 --> 00:46:03.417
We're not coming back.

469
00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:05.419
Allison. I have rights.

470
00:46:05.452 --> 00:46:06.730
I don't care what the court
said.

471
00:46:06.754 --> 00:46:07.754
He's my son.

472
00:46:08.254 --> 00:46:10.791
I just wanna see my grandson.

473
00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:13.894
This was a mistake.

474
00:46:13.926 --> 00:46:14.761
I'm sorry.

475
00:46:14.794 --> 00:46:15.794
Allison. wait.

476
00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:05.512
It wasn't my fault.

477
00:49:41.568 --> 00:49:42.403
Pull over.

478
00:49:42.435 --> 00:49:44.138
I feel sick.

479
00:49:44.171 --> 00:49:45.171
Pull over.

480
00:49:49.309 --> 00:49:50.109
I feel sick.

481
00:49:50.142 --> 00:49:51.142
Pull over.

482
00:50:03.022 --> 00:50:04.691
And you're the embarrassing one

483
00:50:04.725 --> 00:50:06.527
taking me away from my friends.

484
00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:09.430
Allison. your drunk
coworkers aren't your friends.

485
00:50:09.463 --> 00:50:11.464
Least I have friends.

486
00:50:11.497 --> 00:50:12.432
You're a mean drunk.

487
00:50:12.466 --> 00:50:13.334
And keep it down.

488
00:50:13.367 --> 00:50:14.367
Theo's asleep.

489
00:50:15.135 --> 00:50:18.404
You just never wanna talk
about anything important.

490
00:50:18.437 --> 00:50:19.506
Important?

491
00:50:19.539 --> 00:50:21.675
Allison. I'm sick of having
the same conversation

492
00:50:21.707 --> 00:50:22.776
with you over and over.

493
00:50:22.809 --> 00:50:25.546
Oh. and by the way. you
wanna talk about important?

494
00:50:25.578 --> 00:50:26.723
You wanna talk about important?

495
00:50:26.747 --> 00:50:27.815
Your boss called today.

496
00:50:27.847 --> 00:50:30.183
You wanna guess what
important thing he had to say?

497
00:50:30.216 --> 00:50:32.051
They're gonna fire you.

498
00:50:32.084 --> 00:50:33.686
The school called today also.

499
00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:35.689
You forgot to pick Theo up.

500
00:50:35.722 --> 00:50:37.433
And let's talk about
another important thing.

501
00:50:37.457 --> 00:50:40.194
You need to go to rehab again.

502
00:50:40.227 --> 00:50:41.227
Fuck you.

503
00:50:45.664 --> 00:50:48.067
Is this the mother you wanted
to be?

504
00:50:56.309 --> 00:50:57.309
No.

505
00:50:58.278 --> 00:50:59.646
Daddy?

506
00:50:59.678 --> 00:51:01.214
I don't wanna
have this fight again.

507
00:51:01.247 --> 00:51:02.548
Theo. keep it down. Theo.

508
00:51:02.582 --> 00:51:04.718
The school called.

509
00:51:04.751 --> 00:51:08.089
Mommy. mommy. mommy. mommy!

510
00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:14.328
Mommy. mommy. mommy. mommy!

511
00:51:17.531 --> 00:51:19.734
Mommy. mommy. mommy. mommy!

512
00:51:54.834 --> 00:51:56.202
Nine. nine.

513
00:51:56.236 --> 00:51:57.571
No.

514
00:51:57.604 --> 00:51:58.604
911.

515
00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:02.408
This is 911.

516
00:52:02.441 --> 00:52:04.177
What's your emergency?

517
00:52:04.211 --> 00:52:06.280
There is a monster in the room.

518
00:52:06.312 --> 00:52:08.414
and I don't know where my mom
is.

519
00:52:08.448 --> 00:52:09.550
What's the address?

520
00:52:09.582 --> 00:52:10.416
I don't know.

521
00:52:10.450 --> 00:52:11.819
It's a scary green house.

522
00:52:11.852 --> 00:52:13.487
If you don't know the address.

523
00:52:13.519 --> 00:52:15.222
I'm tracking the GPS.

524
00:52:15.254 --> 00:52:16.088
I'm scared.

525
00:52:16.122 --> 00:52:17.758
Find a safe place to hide

526
00:52:17.790 --> 00:52:19.392
until the police arrive.

527
00:52:19.426 --> 00:52:20.594
Got it.

528
00:52:20.627 --> 00:52:22.263
Stay on the line.

529
00:52:41.814 --> 00:52:43.249
Go away.

530
00:52:47.821 --> 00:52:48.655
Go away.

531
00:52:48.687 --> 00:52:49.856
I'm tired.

532
00:52:52.158 --> 00:52:53.158
Police.

533
00:53:13.914 --> 00:53:17.551
Ma'am. we've received a 911
call from this residence

534
00:53:17.584 --> 00:53:19.752
indicating that someone
might be in trouble.

535
00:53:20.553 --> 00:53:22.455
Ma'am. are you the
only one in the house?

536
00:53:22.488 --> 00:53:23.488
Yes.

537
00:53:24.457 --> 00:53:25.626
No.

538
00:53:25.658 --> 00:53:26.859
My son is here.

539
00:53:26.892 --> 00:53:27.892
Where is he?

540
00:53:30.229 --> 00:53:31.231
Upstairs.

541
00:53:32.066 --> 00:53:33.834
Ma'am. the call we received
indicated

542
00:53:33.867 --> 00:53:36.702
that there may be an
intruder in the house.

543
00:53:36.736 --> 00:53:39.339
I haven't heard anyone.

544
00:53:40.173 --> 00:53:43.509
Ma'am. we received a call
from a scared little boy.

545
00:53:43.542 --> 00:53:46.180
I'm gonna have to ask you some
questions.

546
00:53:46.213 --> 00:53:47.680
Okay.

547
00:53:47.714 --> 00:53:49.550
Do you mind if I look around?

548
00:53:49.582 --> 00:53:50.651
Come on in.

549
00:55:08.894 --> 00:55:10.530
Wait there.

550
00:55:10.562 --> 00:55:11.798
I'm gonna go check it out.

551
00:55:39.725 --> 00:55:40.827
Hi. sweetie.

552
00:55:40.859 --> 00:55:42.328
I'm officer stryker.

553
00:55:43.330 --> 00:55:44.330
Are you okay?

554
00:55:45.464 --> 00:55:46.464
Are you okay?

555
00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:51.470
Hey.

556
00:55:54.807 --> 00:55:55.641
Oh. good.

557
00:55:55.675 --> 00:55:57.343
Oh. you scared me.

558
00:55:57.377 --> 00:55:58.377
What's your name?

559
00:56:00.379 --> 00:56:01.548
Theo.

560
00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:04.318
Theo. that's a cool name.

561
00:56:04.350 --> 00:56:06.053
Theo. who's this?

562
00:56:06.086 --> 00:56:06.986
Bunny.

563
00:56:07.021 --> 00:56:11.357
Bunny. nice to meet you. bunny
and Theo.

564
00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:12.459
Are you okay?

565
00:56:13.626 --> 00:56:15.461
You promise?

566
00:56:15.495 --> 00:56:16.930
Are you really okay?

567
00:56:20.499 --> 00:56:21.901
Is somebody hurting you?

568
00:56:21.935 --> 00:56:24.905
The monster.

569
00:56:24.937 --> 00:56:26.073
The monster?

570
00:56:27.874 --> 00:56:29.042
Where's the monster?

571
00:56:30.042 --> 00:56:31.044
In this house.

572
00:56:32.845 --> 00:56:34.881
What does the monster look
like. Theo?

573
00:56:36.982 --> 00:56:37.982
A spider.

574
00:56:39.452 --> 00:56:40.285
Like a spider?

575
00:56:40.319 --> 00:56:42.588
Theo. can you look at me for a
second?

576
00:56:43.957 --> 00:56:45.459
Like this. like a spider?

577
00:56:47.993 --> 00:56:50.631
Can you describe what
the spider looks like?

578
00:56:51.798 --> 00:56:52.832
Bigger.

579
00:56:52.865 --> 00:56:53.865
Bigger?

580
00:56:55.968 --> 00:56:59.438
Theo. I've been where you are.

581
00:56:59.472 --> 00:57:04.477
When I was your age. everything
was so big and scary.

582
00:57:04.778 --> 00:57:07.680
But guess what. I grew up. I got
bigger.

583
00:57:07.714 --> 00:57:10.551
and I got stronger. and
I know you will too.

584
00:57:13.452 --> 00:57:18.057
If you ever get scared
and you need anything.

585
00:57:18.091 --> 00:57:20.661
you call me and I'll be right
there.

586
00:57:22.995 --> 00:57:26.832
Okay. I'm gonna go talk
to your mom in private.

587
00:57:26.865 --> 00:57:28.768
I'm gonna be right around the
corner.

588
00:57:30.669 --> 00:57:32.405
Are you okay here?

589
00:57:34.441 --> 00:57:35.441
Look at me. Theo.

590
00:57:36.075 --> 00:57:37.444
You gonna be okay here?

591
00:57:37.477 --> 00:57:38.477
Promise?

592
00:57:39.111 --> 00:57:40.414
Okay.

593
00:57:40.446 --> 00:57:42.415
You are such a brave boy.

594
00:57:43.482 --> 00:57:44.618
You and bunny.

595
00:57:46.519 --> 00:57:47.519
So brave.

596
00:57:51.624 --> 00:57:52.492
Bye. Theo.

597
00:57:52.524 --> 00:57:53.793
Bye. bunny.

598
00:57:53.827 --> 00:57:55.995
I'll be right around the
corner if you need me.

599
00:59:20.879 --> 00:59:22.615
Estes. I found the kid.

600
00:59:22.649 --> 00:59:24.284
He's safe downstairs.

601
00:59:24.316 --> 00:59:25.751
I'll be damned.

602
00:59:45.537 --> 00:59:48.274
Ma'am. how much have
you had to drink tonight?

603
00:59:48.307 --> 00:59:49.909
I've had a couple drinks.

604
00:59:50.877 --> 00:59:52.246
In my own house.

605
00:59:53.845 --> 00:59:55.815
It seems like you've had quite
a few.

606
01:00:02.254 --> 01:00:04.790
Everything's fine upstairs.

607
01:00:08.928 --> 01:00:09.729
I think I might've figured out

608
01:00:09.761 --> 01:00:12.097
who the possible intruder might
be.

609
01:00:12.131 --> 01:00:13.098
When I was looking around.

610
01:00:13.131 --> 01:00:16.068
I saw the trashcan had
been rummaged through.

611
01:00:16.102 --> 01:00:19.105
A raccoon may have possibly
come in through the window

612
01:00:19.138 --> 01:00:21.141
and was looking around for food.

613
01:00:24.243 --> 01:00:26.346
Sounds like a false alarm.

614
01:00:26.379 --> 01:00:27.379
Yes. it does.

615
01:00:29.247 --> 01:00:31.216
Ma'am. I suggest you
be a little more careful

616
01:00:31.249 --> 01:00:32.985
around those open windows.

617
01:00:33.019 --> 01:00:33.852
Thank you. sir.

618
01:00:33.885 --> 01:00:34.953
I will.

619
01:00:34.986 --> 01:00:37.624
Ma'am. I suggest you don't
consume so much alcohol

620
01:00:37.656 --> 01:00:39.292
when you have a minor around.

621
01:00:39.325 --> 01:00:42.162
Thank you. ma'am. I
will take that to heart.

622
01:00:48.935 --> 01:00:50.737
Ma'am. here's our information

623
01:00:50.769 --> 01:00:52.705
if you have any further
questions.

624
01:00:52.738 --> 01:00:54.340
Thank you. officer.

625
01:02:16.055 --> 01:02:16.923
Hi. George.

626
01:02:16.955 --> 01:02:18.791
It's Allison key.

627
01:02:18.825 --> 01:02:20.169
I've been trying to get a hold
of Jack.

628
01:02:20.193 --> 01:02:25.198
He came by yesterday and
started fixing some things

629
01:02:26.064 --> 01:02:29.702
and left his toolbox
here. and I was hoping

630
01:02:29.736 --> 01:02:32.372
he could finish spraying for
bugs.

631
01:02:32.405 --> 01:02:34.441
So. if you could give me a call

632
01:02:34.473 --> 01:02:37.776
when you get a hold of
him. I'd be super grateful.

633
01:02:37.810 --> 01:02:38.810
Thank you.

634
01:02:39.946 --> 01:02:41.348
Hope you're having a good day.

635
01:03:45.111 --> 01:03:46.379
Theo. are you okay?

636
01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:53.452
Why is the door locked?

637
01:03:53.486 --> 01:03:55.522
I'm just reading comic books.

638
01:03:57.189 --> 01:04:00.092
Okay. well. I'm gonna
go fix some things.

639
01:04:00.126 --> 01:04:03.162
Okay. I'm gonna get
back to my comic book.

640
01:04:03.196 --> 01:04:05.098
Speed tick's in danger.

641
01:04:06.164 --> 01:04:08.033
Well. I'm sure he'll think his
way

642
01:04:08.066 --> 01:04:10.435
out of whatever trouble
he's gotten himself into.

643
01:04:10.468 --> 01:04:12.204
I think he will.

644
01:04:12.238 --> 01:04:14.441
I think he has a plan for the
bad guy.

645
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:20.513
Hey. sport. you know I love
you more than anything. right?

646
01:04:21.981 --> 01:04:22.981
I know.

647
01:05:26.312 --> 01:05:27.914
This is the end of you now.

648
01:05:49.702 --> 01:05:53.339
I know they put a flashlight
in here.

649
01:05:59.711 --> 01:06:01.947
Don't you judge me.

650
01:06:34.714 --> 01:06:36.683
Jack. is that you?

651
01:06:47.459 --> 01:06:48.994
Holy smokes.

652
01:06:49.028 --> 01:06:50.163
What is all this stuff?

653
01:06:51.629 --> 01:06:53.499
It kind of looks like a lab.

654
01:07:15.086 --> 01:07:16.086
Ugh.

655
01:07:17.522 --> 01:07:20.225
Men never clean up after
themselves.

656
01:07:34.339 --> 01:07:35.339
Ugh.

657
01:07:45.151 --> 01:07:49.355
That cheap bastard has watered
it down.

658
01:08:12.077 --> 01:08:13.479
Theo. is that you?

659
01:08:44.642 --> 01:08:46.111
Fucking raccoon.

660
01:09:17.543 --> 01:09:19.212
George.

661
01:09:19.244 --> 01:09:21.080
This is the second time I've
called.

662
01:09:21.948 --> 01:09:24.316
I haven't heard from you or from
Jack.

663
01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:30.388
You can't water down bug spray

664
01:09:30.422 --> 01:09:33.392
and expect it to work.
you cheap ass bastard.

665
01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:36.729
You thought I wouldn't notice.

666
01:09:36.762 --> 01:09:38.598
I am very aware.

667
01:09:41.499 --> 01:09:44.337
I need you to send Jack here
today.

668
01:09:45.671 --> 01:09:46.671
Thank you.

669
01:10:05.658 --> 01:10:08.328
So. who are you. Mr. Scientist?

670
01:10:11.497 --> 01:10:13.199
Lizzie's getting worse.

671
01:10:13.231 --> 01:10:14.734
Her headaches are nonstop.

672
01:10:14.766 --> 01:10:16.568
My fear is that the cancer is
spreading

673
01:10:16.601 --> 01:10:18.805
more rapidly than originally
diagnosed.

674
01:10:21.774 --> 01:10:24.577
My last mixture did not
slow down the cancer.

675
01:10:24.610 --> 01:10:26.412
but I am positive I found the
cure.

676
01:10:27.079 --> 01:10:29.516
The scorpion venom was
not powerful enough.

677
01:10:30.182 --> 01:10:32.284
The scorpion needed to
be genetically crossbred

678
01:10:32.318 --> 01:10:36.189
with another creature's
venom to be more powerful.

679
01:10:36.221 --> 01:10:37.622
I've also added growth hormones

680
01:10:37.655 --> 01:10:40.392
to speed up the production of
the venom.

681
01:10:40.426 --> 01:10:43.930
My research into the DNA
of the chimera indicates

682
01:10:43.962 --> 01:10:46.631
that this unique cross
of a spider and scorpion

683
01:10:46.664 --> 01:10:48.600
should produce a proper type of
venom.

684
01:10:49.735 --> 01:10:51.371
I think I've finally succeeded.

685
01:10:52.137 --> 01:10:54.173
I'm confident this will cure
Lizzie.

686
01:10:55.807 --> 01:10:57.209
Daddy?

687
01:10:57.243 --> 01:10:58.444
Just one second. honey.

688
01:11:01.512 --> 01:11:02.781
I don't feel very well.

689
01:11:14.392 --> 01:11:15.962
It's gonna be okay.

690
01:11:15.994 --> 01:11:17.196
I've found the cure.

691
01:11:17.763 --> 01:11:18.864
No more shots. daddy.

692
01:11:20.031 --> 01:11:21.266
It's time.

693
01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:22.601
No.

694
01:11:22.635 --> 01:11:23.635
We're gonna fight.

695
01:11:25.937 --> 01:11:29.307
Lizzie?

696
01:11:29.341 --> 01:11:30.341
Lizzie.

697
01:11:30.943 --> 01:11:32.345
Lizzie. please. wake up.

698
01:11:33.412 --> 01:11:34.412
Lizzie.

699
01:11:36.448 --> 01:11:37.448
Please. no.

700
01:11:38.449 --> 01:11:39.449
Lizzie. wake up.

701
01:11:41.287 --> 01:11:42.821
Lizzie. come on.

702
01:11:42.855 --> 01:11:43.855
Come on. baby.

703
01:11:45.723 --> 01:11:46.993
Lizzie. come on.

704
01:11:50.495 --> 01:11:52.530
Come on. baby. come on.

705
01:11:52.564 --> 01:11:55.368
One. two. three. four. five.
six.

706
01:11:56.401 --> 01:11:59.471
One. two. three. four. five.
six.

707
01:11:59.504 --> 01:12:00.272
Come on. baby.

708
01:12:00.306 --> 01:12:01.641
One. two. three. four. five.
six.

709
01:12:03.441 --> 01:12:04.243
Come on.

710
01:12:04.275 --> 01:12:05.845
Come on. come on. come on. come
on.

711
01:12:16.622 --> 01:12:17.890
Come on. baby.

712
01:12:17.922 --> 01:12:18.922
Come on.

713
01:12:19.792 --> 01:12:20.626
Come on.

714
01:12:20.659 --> 01:12:21.627
Wake up.

715
01:12:21.659 --> 01:12:23.296
Lizzie. wake up.

716
01:12:23.329 --> 01:12:23.997
Come on. Lizzie.

717
01:12:24.029 --> 01:12:25.764
There we go.

718
01:12:25.797 --> 01:12:26.865
There we go.

719
01:12:26.899 --> 01:12:29.068
Lizzie. good job.

720
01:12:29.101 --> 01:12:30.101
Why?

721
01:12:35.841 --> 01:12:37.744
No. Lizzie. please.

722
01:12:39.645 --> 01:12:41.914
Wake up.

723
01:12:41.946 --> 01:12:42.847
Wake up.

724
01:12:42.881 --> 01:12:44.316
Wake up. please.

725
01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:50.589
Wake up. please. Lizzie.

726
01:12:51.623 --> 01:12:52.658
Come on.

727
01:12:52.690 --> 01:12:53.690
Wake up.

728
01:13:00.932 --> 01:13:04.337
No.

729
01:13:04.369 --> 01:13:05.503
No.

730
01:13:05.537 --> 01:13:06.739
No. no. no. no.

731
01:13:35.534 --> 01:13:36.936
We'll meet again little one.

732
01:13:36.968 --> 01:13:38.503
We'll meet again.

733
01:14:40.132 --> 01:14:42.935
Oh. what happened to this
little girl?

734
01:15:02.654 --> 01:15:03.654
Theo?

735
01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:09.060
Theo?

736
01:15:10.762 --> 01:15:11.762
Theo.

737
01:15:20.204 --> 01:15:25.211
Theo?

738
01:15:27.245 --> 01:15:28.079
Oh my god.

739
01:15:28.113 --> 01:15:29.748
What's happened?

740
01:15:34.552 --> 01:15:36.721
911. what's your emergency?

741
01:15:37.756 --> 01:15:39.258
My son is missing.

742
01:15:39.290 --> 01:15:41.593
How long has he been missing?

743
01:15:43.294 --> 01:15:44.195
I don't know.

744
01:15:44.230 --> 01:15:45.897
Ma'am. how old is your son?

745
01:15:45.931 --> 01:15:46.999
I'm sorry.

746
01:15:47.031 --> 01:15:48.834
What's your address?

747
01:15:49.767 --> 01:15:50.602
Hello?

748
01:15:50.636 --> 01:15:52.605
Ma'am. stay on the line.

749
01:16:27.873 --> 01:16:28.873
Theo!

750
01:16:44.589 --> 01:16:46.726
Police. we're coming in.

751
01:16:50.095 --> 01:16:53.798
Ma'am. we're responding to a 911
call.

752
01:16:53.832 --> 01:16:55.633
Do you understand?

753
01:16:55.667 --> 01:16:57.136
Yes. finally.

754
01:16:57.168 --> 01:16:59.037
Where's your son?

755
01:16:59.070 --> 01:16:59.904
I don't know.

756
01:16:59.937 --> 01:17:01.073
That's why I called you.

757
01:17:01.105 --> 01:17:03.275
When was the last time you saw
your son?

758
01:17:07.279 --> 01:17:08.948
I can't remember.

759
01:17:10.649 --> 01:17:13.185
Could he be at a friend's
house. a neighbor's house?

760
01:17:14.186 --> 01:17:15.087
We just moved here.

761
01:17:15.119 --> 01:17:17.055
No. we don't know anyone.

762
01:17:18.923 --> 01:17:20.592
Has anybody been to the house

763
01:17:20.626 --> 01:17:22.328
since the last time you saw your
son?

764
01:17:24.296 --> 01:17:25.097
No.

765
01:17:25.129 --> 01:17:27.031
The only people that know we're
here

766
01:17:27.065 --> 01:17:31.203
are the landlord and the
handyman.

767
01:17:31.235 --> 01:17:33.972
Could they have kidnapped my
son?

768
01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:37.610
I'll go up and take a look
around.

769
01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:42.948
Ma'am. how much have you
had to drink this time?

770
01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:44.349
It's none of your business.

771
01:17:44.382 --> 01:17:45.984
Oh. actually. it is my business.

772
01:17:46.017 --> 01:17:46.851
Fuck you.

773
01:17:46.885 --> 01:17:48.253
You are under arrest.

774
01:17:50.221 --> 01:17:52.857
Ms. Key. you have the
right to remain silent.

775
01:17:52.891 --> 01:17:55.794
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

776
01:17:55.827 --> 01:17:57.262
in a court of law.

777
01:17:57.294 --> 01:17:58.696
You have the right to an
attorney.

778
01:17:58.730 --> 01:18:00.366
If you cannot afford an
attorney.

779
01:18:00.399 --> 01:18:02.334
one will be appointed to you.

780
01:18:52.984 --> 01:18:54.787
Where are you. kid?

781
01:19:38.363 --> 01:19:39.865
I'm sorry.

782
01:19:39.897 --> 01:19:40.966
I'm sorry.

783
01:19:42.501 --> 01:19:44.704
I never meant for any of this to
happen.

784
01:19:46.137 --> 01:19:47.238
Alcoholics never do.

785
01:19:50.175 --> 01:19:52.910
Please find my son.

786
01:19:52.944 --> 01:19:54.814
He's all I have left.

787
01:19:56.213 --> 01:19:59.450
We will do everything in
our power to find your son.

788
01:19:59.484 --> 01:20:02.521
And. when we do. I will
do everything in my power

789
01:20:02.553 --> 01:20:03.922
to protect him from you.

790
01:20:06.792 --> 01:20:07.493
What if he's right?

791
01:20:07.525 --> 01:20:09.729
What if there's a monster?

792
01:20:14.031 --> 01:20:15.234
Look at yourself.

793
01:20:15.266 --> 01:20:16.968
The only monster here is you.

794
01:20:24.476 --> 01:20:26.378
You sit there and sober up.

795
01:20:47.565 --> 01:20:50.234
Estes. are you okay?

796
01:20:50.267 --> 01:20:51.102
Officer down.

797
01:20:51.136 --> 01:20:52.070
I repeat. officer down.

798
01:20:52.102 --> 01:20:53.271
Send backup immediately.

799
01:20:58.008 --> 01:21:00.212
Estes. who did this?

800
01:21:00.244 --> 01:21:03.915
Find the boy and get the fuck
out now.

801
01:21:03.949 --> 01:21:05.350
Estes. you stay with me.

802
01:21:05.382 --> 01:21:06.382
Estes.

803
01:21:07.218 --> 01:21:08.419
Estes. who did this?

804
01:21:08.453 --> 01:21:10.256
Stay with me. estes.

805
01:21:12.623 --> 01:21:13.623
Estes.

806
01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:16.195
I gotta get outta here.

807
01:21:16.227 --> 01:21:18.263
I gotta get you outta here.

808
01:21:19.597 --> 01:21:20.431
Help

809
01:21:20.466 --> 01:21:21.510
come on. I gotta get you outta
here.

810
01:21:21.534 --> 01:21:24.102
Not without my son.

811
01:21:35.379 --> 01:21:36.379
Theo?

812
01:21:44.455 --> 01:21:45.455
Oh my god. Jack.

813
01:22:07.311 --> 01:22:08.412
Theo?

814
01:22:08.445 --> 01:22:11.015
Help. I'm trapped.

815
01:22:11.048 --> 01:22:12.484
I'm stuck in the web.

816
01:22:13.618 --> 01:22:15.187
I'll get you out.

817
01:22:15.220 --> 01:22:16.288
Ow.

818
01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:17.320
You can't.

819
01:22:23.227 --> 01:22:24.562
Yes. we can.

820
01:22:24.596 --> 01:22:26.365
Remember the elephant?

821
01:22:26.397 --> 01:22:27.498
Yeah.

822
01:22:27.531 --> 01:22:28.576
The elephant didn't get free

823
01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:30.401
because it didn't think it
could.

824
01:22:30.435 --> 01:22:31.602
We will be free.

825
01:22:34.172 --> 01:22:35.207
Move slowly.

826
01:22:36.074 --> 01:22:38.010
It's part spider.

827
01:22:38.944 --> 01:22:41.379
It senses your movement.

828
01:22:41.413 --> 01:22:42.247
Sh.

829
01:22:42.279 --> 01:22:43.279
Hide.

830
01:22:45.083 --> 01:22:46.083
I'll protect you.

831
01:22:47.319 --> 01:22:49.354
I'll lure it away from you.

832
01:23:06.003 --> 01:23:06.837
I'm here.

833
01:23:06.872 --> 01:23:08.307
Come and get me. you son of a
bitch.

834
01:23:32.430 --> 01:23:33.430
Theo.

835
01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:37.435
Theo?

836
01:23:37.468 --> 01:23:39.604
Come on. come on.

837
01:23:39.637 --> 01:23:40.637
Come on.

838
01:23:49.614 --> 01:23:50.449
Bunny.

839
01:23:50.481 --> 01:23:51.315
Wait.

840
01:23:51.348 --> 01:23:52.217
Bunny.

841
01:23:52.249 --> 01:23:53.249
Bunny.

842
01:23:56.454 --> 01:23:59.157
It doesn't want to leave its
nest.

843
01:23:59.190 --> 01:24:00.190
Theo. get back.

844
01:24:21.046 --> 01:24:23.015
I told you I would protect you.

845
01:24:37.729 --> 01:24:42.735
Come on.

846
01:25:11.361 --> 01:25:12.230
Hey.

847
01:25:12.262 --> 01:25:13.330
How are you?

848
01:25:13.364 --> 01:25:14.364
Good. thanks.

849
01:25:15.199 --> 01:25:16.801
Congratulations on 180 days.

850
01:25:16.834 --> 01:25:17.502
Thank you.

851
01:25:17.535 --> 01:25:19.236
I would not be here without you.

852
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:20.205
You know that.

853
01:25:20.238 --> 01:25:22.374
You did all the hard work.

854
01:25:22.406 --> 01:25:23.646
Well. without your persistence.

855
01:25:23.675 --> 01:25:25.677
I wouldn't have started it.

856
01:25:25.709 --> 01:25:26.711
I'm there for you.

857
01:25:26.744 --> 01:25:27.579
I know.

858
01:25:27.611 --> 01:25:28.611
How's Theo doing?

859
01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:30.515
All right. thanks.

860
01:25:30.548 --> 01:25:33.118
Two nightmares this week.
but just is what it is.

861
01:25:33.150 --> 01:25:34.228
Okay. well. he's a tough kid.

862
01:25:34.252 --> 01:25:37.789
- I'm sure he'll get past this.
- Yeah.

863
01:25:37.821 --> 01:25:40.092
It's just day by day. you know?

864
01:25:40.124 --> 01:25:41.359
- All of it.
- Yeah.

865
01:25:41.391 --> 01:25:42.726
We're all day-to-day.

866
01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:45.129
So. hey. let's get inside.

867
01:25:45.163 --> 01:25:46.064
I know you got a speech to give.

868
01:25:46.097 --> 01:25:49.734
180 days. that's something to be
proud of.

869
01:25:49.766 --> 01:25:50.734
Really. thank you.

870
01:25:50.767 --> 01:25:52.604
Oh. please don't thank me.

871
01:25:52.637 --> 01:25:53.472
It was all you.

872
01:25:53.504 --> 01:25:54.338
You did the hard work.

873
01:25:54.372 --> 01:25:55.372
Come on. let's go.

874
01:26:20.931 --> 01:26:22.399
I forgot the masks.

875
01:26:22.432 --> 01:26:23.100
Masks?

876
01:26:23.133 --> 01:26:25.302
We don't need no stinking masks.

877
01:26:25.336 --> 01:26:26.771
Besides. this stuff is organic.

878
01:26:28.239 --> 01:26:30.709
This is basically useless.

879
01:26:30.742 --> 01:26:33.311
Yeah. but we get to
charge three times more.

880
01:26:36.213 --> 01:26:37.848
This place reminds me of my
childhood.

881
01:26:37.882 --> 01:26:39.518
You make this stuff yourself?

882
01:26:39.551 --> 01:26:41.419
Some of it.

883
01:26:41.452 --> 01:26:42.830
You know. glad fire
got here when they did.

884
01:26:42.854 --> 01:26:44.756
otherwise this place would've
gone up.

885
01:26:46.223 --> 01:26:47.223
You ever smelled one?

886
01:26:47.626 --> 01:26:50.829
It'd be a lot easier to torch
this place than to clean it.

887
01:26:52.931 --> 01:26:54.232
What the fuck is that?

888
01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:56.735
Oh my god.

889
01:26:56.767 --> 01:26:57.601
- Oh.
- Oh no.

890
01:26:57.635 --> 01:26:58.302
It's just the doorway.

891
01:26:58.336 --> 01:26:59.870
I thought it was a jackalope.

892
01:26:59.904 --> 01:27:01.906
Smells like a jackalope down
here.

893
01:27:02.774 --> 01:27:04.209
I smelled a dead one.

894
01:27:04.242 --> 01:27:05.709
I have not smelled a live
jackalope.

895
01:27:05.743 --> 01:27:08.713
No. oddly enough. the live
one's worse than the dead one.

896
01:27:08.745 --> 01:27:09.480
They're worse?

897
01:27:09.513 --> 01:27:10.724
- They get better... go figure.

898
01:27:10.748 --> 01:27:11.817
- With death?
- Yeah.

899
01:27:13.284 --> 01:27:14.586
I'm sure I tasted a lot.

900
01:27:17.855 --> 01:27:19.424
I think that's all of them.

901
01:27:20.557 --> 01:27:23.294
Should I spray in the vents?

902
01:27:23.328 --> 01:27:24.428
Nah. I don't think so.

903
01:27:24.462 --> 01:27:26.798
That seems like a lot of work.

904
01:27:26.830 --> 01:27:28.967
I feel like we've wrapped this
up.

905
01:27:28.999 --> 01:27:30.569
Yeah.

906
01:27:30.601 --> 01:27:32.836
But are they gonna.
should we stay down here.

907
01:27:32.869 --> 01:27:34.573
or do we get paid by the hour?

908
01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:38.519
Well. we could take a long
time to take this backpack off.

909
01:27:38.543 --> 01:27:39.844
We should dump some of this out.

910
01:27:39.877 --> 01:27:41.513
looks like where we sprayed.

911
01:27:41.546 --> 01:27:42.847
Get something to eat?

912
01:27:42.879 --> 01:27:44.748
- I am very hungry.
- Garbage plates?

913
01:27:44.781 --> 01:27:47.886
Is there a jackalope
restaurant around here?

914
01:27:47.918 --> 01:27:49.587
Put that on the garbage plate.

915
01:27:50.654 --> 01:27:51.789
Race you to the Van.

916
01:27:51.823 --> 01:27:53.825
All right. I'll give you a
headstart.

917
01:27:55.627 --> 01:27:58.363
- Oh. fuck.
- Oh. mother of...

918
01:28:00.498 --> 01:28:02.968
That must be one fucking spider.

919
01:28:03.001 --> 01:28:05.669
What is it. it's like a ride
share here?

920
01:28:05.703 --> 01:28:06.538
It's huge.

921
01:28:06.570 --> 01:28:07.805
Looks like a bounce house.

922
01:28:09.373 --> 01:28:11.508
You know what. this is so effed
up.

923
01:28:11.542 --> 01:28:14.846
We're here to kill bugs.
not to clean up after them.

924
01:28:15.913 --> 01:28:16.913
I'm out.

925
01:28:45.909 --> 01:28:47.511
Where are you?

926
01:28:48.445 --> 01:28:49.513
Hm?

927
01:28:52.016 --> 01:28:53.518
Where are you?

928
01:28:58.556 --> 01:29:01.593
I see the baby.

929
01:29:01.626 --> 01:29:03.895
Oh. look at that little baby.

930

01:29:23.981 --> 01:29:27.551
Those mean old people. they hurt
mommy.

you again.

Some place where you can
grow and grow and grow.
