3
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.808
Mackenzie: Alright. Here we go.

4
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.358
Mackenzie: If anything happens.
that $30 goes to my mom's new car.

5
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.568
Realistically. if anything happens-

6
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.188
you guys get in trouble for encouraging
me to do this in the first place.

7
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.498
It's not my fault I need the money
and you guys took advantage of that.

8
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.000
Just saying.

9
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.518
Sorry. I - I didn't think to try to show her.

10
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.108
I guess. um. trying to get smooth
video when you're about to die-

11
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.400
is not my first instinct.

12
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.708
I don't feel well.

13
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.390
That was not worth $30. But I'll take it.

14
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.908
Mackenzie: Hi. uh. Elizabeth?

15
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.208
I'm Mackenzie.

16
00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.298
Liz: Hi. uh.

17
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.828
Where did your parents park?

18
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.450
Oh. um. it's just me. I rode my bike here.

19
00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.488
Oh. thank you.

20
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.228
Liz: Sure. I figured after a
long ride you might be thirsty.

21
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.790
Mackenzie: I have a thermos on my bike I
just didn't want to bring it up to the door.

22
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.128
Why?

23
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:50.198
Feels unprofessional.

24
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.278
Unprofessional?

25
00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.658
Could you imagine a grownup
just waltzing into a job interview-

26
00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.418
with a big. obnoxious pink thermos?

27
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.978
Yeah. I guess - probably not.

28
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.638
Exactly.

29
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.048
Liz: So. you take this that seriously?

30
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:06.488
Mackenzie: Of course I do.

31
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.258
You - any guardian or parent-

32
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.608
You're entrusting me with the
safety of. not only your house.

33
00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.488
but your most precious possession.
So I better take it seriously.

34
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.208
That's uh...

35
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.690
That's a refreshing point of view.

36
00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.178
I talked to your references. uh.

37
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:30.178
Mrs. Phillips. Mrs. Long. Mr. Breck.

38
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.198
They all said you were great. And they
mentioned your fine attention to detail.

39
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.648
I thought they might.

40
00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.548
Can I ask why you like babysitting?

41
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:42.098
I've always been good with kids. Younger kids.

42
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:46.018
I have a little brother and sister - twins.
And I've always helped out with them.

43
00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:50.040
So. I'm good with kids and I like making
money. So babysitting is like - perfect.

44
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.528
I see.

45
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:56.638
Uh - you're sure your parents don't want to meet me?

46
00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.738
They're okay with you spending the night over here?

47
00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.580
Yep. They know where I am and they trust me.

48
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.288
Yeah. uh...

49
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.288
Let me...

50
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.958
...give you a tour of the house and...

51
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.578
Liz: We'll see you on Friday.

52
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.818
Alright. Thanks. Elizabeth.

53
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:22.938
Call me Liz.

54
00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:26.958
That's the basement. It's off limits
so don't let Peyton tell you otherwise.

55
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.830
Sure. no problem.

56
00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:31.378
You're not going to ask why it's off limits?

57
00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.948
It's none of my business but - if you're offering...

58
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:39.408
It's under construction and it's just uh - not safe.

59
00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:40.708
Not even the stairs.

60
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:44.658
Alright. we'll stay away. >>Good.
Let me show you the last bedroom.

61
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:48.958
That's where you can sleep if you->>I
don't mind the couch. It looks comfy.

62
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.888
Well. let me show you anyway.
Just so you have your options.

63
00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.078
That's my Dad. One moment.

64
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.200
Sure. >>Liz: Hey Dad.

65
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.940
Liz: Yeah. Uh-huh.

66
00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:10.738
Liz: Whoa. You okay? >>Mackenzie: Yeah.

67
00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.478
Mackenzie: Yeah. uh.

68
00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.670
The door just... opened.

69
00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:18.438
It's usually locked.

70
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.218
Liz: But there's a window open down there.

71
00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:25.478
So... it'll blow open if it's ajar even a little.

72
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.490
Okay.

73
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:31.158
Well. uh. Let's.

74
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.870
Let's see the last room.

75
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.768
Did you really just do that?

76
00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:01.058
Cammy: I'm getting bored back here. hurry it up.

77
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.878
Well. that's not going to help. genius.

78
00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:08.938
Well. it entertained me. You almost jumped
out of your chair and I got it on camera.

79
00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.660
Hey. That could've fallen on the floor. are you crazy?

80
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.778
Cammy: Ow.

81
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.098
I almost broke my neck. That wasn't funny.

82
00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.798
I hope you were still recording.

83
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.128
I was.

84
00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:25.000
>>Cammy: You're so dead when I get up.

85
00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:45.478
Did you finish that report yet?

86
00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.328
Almost.

87
00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:50.828
Get it done. And keep it down in here. it's a school night.

88
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:53.968
Birthday exceptions don't mean
you can horse around all night.

89
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:55.378
Okay. sorry.

90
00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.100
Sorry Mr. Vincent. we'll be quieter.

91
00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:01.800
Alright.

92
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.538
You can't horse around all night.

93
00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.218
Stop it. Before your Dad yells at me again.

94
00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.080
Don't start nothin'. won't be nothin'.

95
00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.858
Don't ever say that again.

96
00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.150
Cammy. Cammy. wake up.

97
00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:16.558
What are you doing?

98
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.640
The door opened by itself.

99
00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.688
Your Dad probably opened it. Just close it.

100
00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:23.900
Cammy: Go to bed.

101
00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.000
Are you girls alright?

102
00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:01.438
Hey. what's up?

103
00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.438
I'm just getting ready for practice.

104
00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.848
Cammy: Are you still babysitting?
Duh. Why wouldn't I be?

105
00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:10.288
Um. because their house is obviously haunted.

106
00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.018
And whatever's there followed you
home and scared the hell out of us.

107
00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:16.058
How do you know it came
from there and not the cornfield?

108
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.078
What do you mean?

109
00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.518
The cornfield I went into.
Cammy: Which I told you not to do.

110
00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.508
Cammy: For the record. >>Whatever.

111
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:28.328
Behind it. there's woods. A stream.
And on the other side another cornfield.

112
00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:30.108
The one on Valley Boulevard.

113
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:31.748
Right.

114
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:34.438
They say there's a woman in white haunting there.

115
00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.608
She resembles a girl who went missing in the 80's.

116
00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:40.868
Mackenzie: They say she was sacrificed to some demon.

117
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:45.828
Cammy: Yeah. And it takes on her form
and tricks people into sacrificing to it.

118
00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:49.608
Yeah. Heather Morris committed suicide there.

119
00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:52.448
And another guy got stabbed.
Which is why they closed the road.

120
00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:54.558
So people wouldn't go in.

121
00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.898
Because of the deaths not because
they believe it was really haunted.

122
00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:01.908
I don't know. But the cornfield
that I went to was really close.

123
00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:04.568
Mackenzie: Like. not even two miles away.

124
00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:07.038
Mackenzie: If something was going on there. then-

125
00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.408
Cammy: What? You think it followed you or something?

126
00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:13.938
I'm not sure but whatever
happened last night was really creepy.

127
00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:16.558
Cammy: Well if it makes you feel any better...

128
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:20.058
Cammy: Any of the stories I've heard
have all been based on Valley Boulevard.

129
00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:22.408
Sounds dumb. but...

130
00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:25.520
Hopefully if there's something
there. it's trapped there.

131
00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:31.198
Cammy: You scared? >>No.
just trying to figure everything out.

132
00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.118
Anyway. I better go.

133
00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.910
I want to start biking there before
it gets dark. >>Cammy: Good idea.

134
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:05.188
Peyton: If I chip in a dollar.
could you help me with this?

135
00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:07.638
You don't have to pay me to help you with your homework.

136
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.488
That's kinda part of the job.

137
00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:14.540
I don't really want your help.
I just want you to do the rest.

138
00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.108
You have four problems left.

139
00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:19.570
Five. If you don't just do it for me.

140
00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:23.548
You'll need more than a dollar.

141
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:26.348
Fine. Just don't fall asleep tonight.

142
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:27.818
Why not?

143
00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:31.528
Cuz. I'll wake up and trash
the house so you lose your tip.

144
00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:33.270
It's going to be one of those nights. isn't it?

145
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:39.980
You're doing fine.

146
00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.230
Liz. you okay?

147
00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:51.258
Liz?

148
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.338
Yes?

149
00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:54.158
You okay?

150
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.728
Yeah.

151
00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:58.978
Uh. I - I put the Grub Hub order in.

152
00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:01.158
Liz: Food should be dropped off at 7.

153
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.058
Peyton's bedtime is 8:30.

154
00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:04.890
It's the weekend.

155
00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:06.888
9:30.

156
00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:09.638
Liz: 10 at the latest. >>Yes ma'am.

157
00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.100
Come to the door with me?

158
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.530
Nine. Ten. Eleven. Twelve.

159
00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:29.228
Um. don't open the door for the delivery.

160
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:33.430
Liz: There won't be a car in the driveway.
so if they just see you here. then -

161
00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:37.718
I don't want anything to happen. You never know.

162
00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:41.068
Liz: I'll text you when I get a
notification that the food's here.

163
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:44.068
And I'll send you a picture
of what the driver looks like.

164
00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:45.958
So you know who it's supposed to be.

165
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.518
Sure. No problem.

166
00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.678
Liz: It's contact-less delivery but...

167
00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.428
Sometimes they still knock. I don't know why.

168
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:55.708
Habit. maybe? Or they're just stupid.

169
00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:58.418
>>Both?

170
00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:00.900
Liz: Oh. and... one more thing.

171
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.958
What is it?

172
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.478
We keep the windows open in the basement at night.

173
00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:13.318
And it's kind of an old house
so sometimes there's noise.

174
00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.528
Liz: I should've mentioned that earlier.

175
00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:19.158
If you scare easily tell me now.

176
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.858
I don't.

177
00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:23.210
Mackenzie: The house isn't haunted or anything. is it?

178
00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:25.940
Peyton thinks it is.

179
00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.438
I'll be okay.

180
00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.688
Mackenzie: And...

181
00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:33.400
I'll watch what I say around her so I don't scare her.

182
00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.958
Thank you.

183
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.258
And there's nothing here that
would hurt her or - any of us.

184
00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:45.048
It just... can be unsettling.

185
00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:49.458
I've dealt with worse than spooky
noises. I got this. Don't worry about it.

186
00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:55.330
Alright. Thank you. Mackenzie. I-

187
00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.278
I hope you come back. I have a good feeling about you.

188
00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.000
Um. You too.

189
00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:14.098
Goodnight. See you in the morning. >>Goodnight.

190
00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.078
Uh. goodnight Mackenzie.

191
00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:22.968
Feel free to call or text me if you need anything.

192
00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:26.278
Though. I will be working so
can't say I'll answer right away.

193
00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.430
No problem. Have a great night.

194
00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:50.658
You know this house is haunted. right?

195
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.990
Like. haunted AF.

196
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.278
What? Do you even know what that means?

197
00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.608
Language.

198
00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:10.988
Slow down on those chips. Save some room for dinner.

199
00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:14.098
I have plenty of room. I'm starving.

200
00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:16.650
You worked up an appetite flunking this test. huh?

201
00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.000
I'm just kidding. You got everything right.

202
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:23.978
That was mean.

203
00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:27.348
Not as mean as you threatening
my tip. Good work. though.

204
00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:30.900
So. we've got about an hour before
dinner. What do you want to do?

205
00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:34.878
I don't know. That's your job. Ms. Babysitter.

206
00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.380
I don't know what you like. What do you have around here?

207
00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.168
TV.

208
00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:45.248
It's too early for TV. Don't be a boob.

209
00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:46.778
A boob?

210
00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:49.338
My grandpa calls TV the 'boob tube'.

211
00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:52.428
Cause it turns you into a mindless
boob when you watch it all day.

212
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:53.968
Like Tik Tok?

213
00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:56.238
Not as bad. But that's correct.

214
00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.210
Mackenzie: Well. what do you
do when you have friends over?

215
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:04.100
I don't have any friends.

216
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:06.898
What?

217
00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:10.388
We just moved back here a month ago.

218
00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:12.838
We moved to Delaware for a while.

219
00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.098
Peyton: Then came back here.

220
00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:17.548
I didn't have any friends there. either.

221
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:20.968
Everyone thinks I'm weird just like my mom is.

222
00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:23.288
Your mom's sweet.

223
00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:27.628
Come on. she's weird. You don't have to pretend she's not.

224
00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:31.598
Your mom's got anxiety or
something. okay? That's not weird.

225
00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:34.408
Anyone who says it is. is just dumb and mean.

226
00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:38.898
Well. everyone is dumb and mean.
That's why I don't have any friends.

227
00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:40.350
You have one now.

228
00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:43.760
You're getting paid to be here.

229
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.528
Mackenzie: Right. So I could let you sit in
front of the TV all night and turn into a boob.

230
00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:50.228
But I'm not going to let that happen.

231
00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:53.098
Mackenzie: We're going to have fun. Right now.

232
00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:55.638
Like. right this very second.

233
00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:58.438
So put down those chips. turn that frown upside down.

234
00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.058
And we're going to have some fun.

235
00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:06.970
♪ bouncy. energetic music ♪

236
00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:09.958
Chocolate Chip.

237
00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:12.958
Challenge.

238
00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:18.078
What?

239
00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.230
Yeah!

240
00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:25.410
Mackenzie: Challenge?

241
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.150
Uno.

242
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.160
No.

243
00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:44.758
Done. Uno!

244
00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.438
Peyton: Done. Done. Done. Done. Done.

245
00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:51.840
♪ bouncy. energetic music ♪

246
00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.850
♪ bouncy. energetic music ♪

247
00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:27.520
♪ bouncy. energetic music ♪

248
00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:53.838
What is wrong with you? You
can't even fit all that in your mouth.

249
00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:58.058
>>After all those
fries and that giant burger. too?

250
00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:00.068
That was two hours ago.

251
00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:03.608
I know. and you'll probably ask
me for dessert before bed. too.

252
00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:05.000
Well. of course.

253
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:12.328
Can you be my babysitter from now on?

254
00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:14.100
If your mom's a good tipper.

255
00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:17.858
Not only will I be your babysitter.

256
00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:20.870
But I'll ask your mom if I can come
over sometimes and we can hang out.

257
00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:26.958
Can I ask you a question?

258
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.430
M-hm. >>Why did you guys move?

259
00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:34.968
You promise you'll come back if I tell you?

260
00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:36.440
Of course.

261
00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:43.398
I think our old house was haunted.

262
00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.388
I don't know by what.

263
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:47.608
I never saw anything.

264
00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:50.848
But I know my mom did.

265
00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:53.118
She was scared of something.

266
00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:55.968
She started sleeping in my room.

267
00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:58.808
And became really protective.

268
00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:00.500
How did this all start?

269
00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:06.658
When we came home late from her ex-boyfriend's house.

270
00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:10.778
We were driving somewhere in the woods.

271
00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:13.208
On Hurley Pond Road.

272
00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:15.550
I remember seeing a sign when we left.

273
00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:20.900
I was asleep in the backseat. and...

274
00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.258
Mom?

275
00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:54.820
Mom?

276
00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.560
Mom?

277
00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:49.660
Mom?

278
00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:01.410
Mom?

279
00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:04.480
Mom?

280
00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.310
Mom!

281
00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:36.960
Mom?!

282
00:31:58.800 --> 00:31:59.870
Female Demonic Voice: Hey.

283
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:10.610
Liz: Peyton! Peyton. what are you doing out here?

284
00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:13.198
Where did you go?

285
00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:16.558
I woke up in the car and you were
gone. Why didn't you wake me up?

286
00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:19.068
I - I-I'm sorry. I - I

287
00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:20.738
Peyton. I shouldn't have done that.

288
00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:22.158
Where were you. Mom?

289
00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.998
I...

290
00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:26.338
I thought I saw someone who needed help.

291
00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:30.958
I locked you in the car to keep
you safe. I went to look for her. but...

292
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.358
Who - who did you see?

293
00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:37.268
I - it was no one. Or at least no one who needed help.

294
00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:39.378
I - it doesn't matter.

295
00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:44.528
I shouldn't have done that
and I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

296
00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:45.730
Liz: Do you forgive me?

297
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:50.958
If you get me out of these woods I will.

298
00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:54.400
Deal.

299
00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.078
Peyton: She was different after that.

300
00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.878
She was scared of something.

301
00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.640
And even when she wasn't scared...

302
00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.050
She was always...

303
00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:10.490
Somewhere else. Even when she was home.

304
00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:14.100
That doesn't make sense. does it?

305
00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:15.760
I know what you mean.

306
00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:20.638
The house felt different after that.

307
00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:22.818
It was always cold.

308
00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:25.938
And I would hear things.

309
00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:30.138
I'd have night terrors. I'd wake up in other rooms.

310
00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:32.050
Outside once.

311
00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:38.158
I think that's why we moved.
Although she said it was work.

312
00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:41.668
But whatever it was just followed us there.

313
00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:43.690
And followed us back here.

314
00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:48.100
Do you still have the picture that you took?

315
00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:52.468
Yeah. She deleted it from her phone.

316
00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:55.418
But I sent it to my email and printed it out in school.

317
00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:57.210
It's under my mattress.

318
00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.500
You sure you're going to come back?

319
00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:26.910
You're scared. I can tell.

320
00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:31.038
How old are you?

321
00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.258
Seven.

322
00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:33.398
Mackenzie: I'm fourteen.

323
00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:37.338
If you can go through all of
that and you're okay. I'll be fine.

324
00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.800
I think I saw some brownie mix in the cabinet.

325
00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:44.068
You already complained I was eating too much.

326
00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:47.798
And you are but we need a distraction. so - brownies.

327
00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.568
Brownies!

328
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.268
Ready?

329
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:26.610
Yep. Let's go.

330
00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:56.708
I know. Peyton.

331
00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:58.720
I will come get you tomorrow.

332
00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.930
I just have to deal with something first.

333
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:09.410
You're having fun at your
Grandma and Grandpa's aren't you?

334
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.360
I know.

335
00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:19.000
I will come. First thing in the morning.

336
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.200
Yes.

337
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.100
Yes.

338
00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:28.198
I'll be...

339
00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.158
I'll be fine.

340
00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:31.660
Okay?

341
00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:34.030
Yeah.

342
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.630
Love you.

343
00:37:58.490 --> 00:37:59.958
Liz.

344
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.688
Haley: Hey are you okay?

345
00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:06.080
Haley: I called for you before I
came in. The door was still open.

346
00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:09.568
I...

347
00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:12.428
I didn't hear you. I'm - I'm sorry.

348
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:15.808
It's okay. I'm sorry I scared you.

349
00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:19.018
I just - I heard you moved away.

350
00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:21.228
And I didn't see you for three weeks.

351
00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:24.870
Then I saw your car and I - I just...

352
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:31.018
We moved back.

353
00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:34.600
The other place didn't work out. It's a better deal here.

354
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.258
Sorry. I didn't tell you. It was kind of abrupt.

355
00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:42.548
Yeah. Whatever. it's fine. I was just worried.

356
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:47.128
Hope I didn't get you in trouble with Rick.

357
00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:50.958
The diner's fine. They filled your shift pretty fast.

358
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.058
Liz: But if you need to go back.
I'm sure he'd talk to you about it.

359
00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:56.968
Honestly. we were all just worried.

360
00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:58.990
Are you okay?

361
00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:01.858
Can I get you some coffee?

362
00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:05.268
That's the least you could do.
You just tried to kill me. so...

363
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.510
Maybe you should sit down.

364
00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:30.138
I can't. I...

365
00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:32.268
I have too much energy. I. I...

366
00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:34.018
I can't stop moving. otherwise...

367
00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:35.400
Otherwise. what?

368
00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:44.800
Why won't you look out the window?

369
00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:50.498
Liz. sit down right now.

370
00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:52.580
I can't Haley.

371
00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.540
Liz. Sit.

372
00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:02.738
The coffee's almost ready.

373
00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:06.380
I'll take care of that. The way you're shaking
you'll spill it all over the place. anyway.

374
00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:09.620
Come on.

375
00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:22.238
Liz: I must have fallen asleep at the wheel.

376
00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:27.168
Liz: I don't know. I... I closed my eyes for a second.

377
00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:29.828
Liz: And...

378
00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:31.370
I felt a bump.

379
00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:35.178
And I opened my eyes.

380
00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:39.308
Liz: I... hit the brakes...

381
00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:42.380
Liz: And there was this woman.

382
00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.860
Liz: Running into the woods.

383
00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:57.890
Liz: I left Peyton asleep in the
car. I know I shouldn't have. but...

384
00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:04.000
Liz: I got out to check on her. and...

385
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.728
Liz: I couldn't find her but there was...

386
00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:52.238
Liz: This weird shrine and
even though I couldn't find her-

387
00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:56.018
Liz:... I knew I wasn't alone out there.

388
00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:56.990
Liz: Something was like...

389
00:41:58.990 --> 00:42:02.220
Liz: Waiting for me. I could feel it.

390
00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:04.158
Liz: I feel it...

391
00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:06.040
Liz: I feel it even now.

392
00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:13.068
Almost every time I look out a window. I-

393
00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:16.000
There's something out there. or...

394
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:19.000
...in the room with me.

395
00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:24.788
You really think some entity followed you home?

396
00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:26.840
How else would you explain all this?

397
00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:31.248
Our minds work in mysterious ways.

398
00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:35.098
And you've been through a lot in your life.

399
00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:39.588
You've had to fight to protect
Peyton from very real threats.

400
00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:44.310
And so - I think whatever happened exacerbated that.

401
00:42:45.310 --> 00:42:48.968
And is playing on it in a surreal way.

402
00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:51.988
Through... nightmares.

403
00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:55.708
And maybe... hallucinations.

404
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:57.928
What about Peyton's night terrors?

405
00:42:57.970 --> 00:43:01.548
How does my anxiety explain her
getting up in the middle of the night.

406
00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:03.270
And me having to find her out in the f-

407
00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:08.668
Out in the woods behind our home.

408
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:12.818
In the closet or >>She can
sense what you're going through.

409
00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:16.028
Kids pick up on a lot more than you think.

410
00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:19.748
And just like with her Dad's...

411
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:21.998
...drinking problems.

412
00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:24.268
It can affect her subconsciously.

413
00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:27.140
And come out in all sorts of behaviors.

414
00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:30.710
Haley: I think you ought to talk to someone.

415
00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:35.128
Maybe take something that...

416
00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:38.598
...can help you.

417
00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:41.800
I can get you into my doctor's
office for a free consult.

418
00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:46.380
What else can you do?

419
00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:53.548
Running away obviously didn't help.

420
00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:56.348
I think I have to...

421
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:59.408
Confront her. Or.

422
00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:01.418
It.

423
00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:03.218
Find out what it wants.

424
00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:06.200
And you think it wants Peyton. >>I know it does.

425
00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:08.038
But...

426
00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.958
There has to be something else I can do.

427
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.028
Yeah. and I just gave you the best option.

428
00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:15.628
Do you want to get professional help
or do you want to go into the woods to...

429
00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:18.108
...confront some entity?

430
00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:20.580
I want to protect Peyton.

431
00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:39.848
Peyton: I think evil spirits can be real.

432
00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:41.738
But if they are. then God's real.

433
00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:44.178
I know your mom doesn't believe in that. but...

434
00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:47.018
I don't think she does. But I do.

435
00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:51.058
Mackenzie: Well. good. And if He's
real He's more powerful than any spirit.

436
00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:53.168
No matter how scary they are.

437
00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:57.758
Sometimes. when I get scared.
like. of something like a spirit.

438
00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:01.430
Or like the time my house got
robbed when I was 10. I'd read this.

439
00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:05.108
"He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High.

440
00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:08.388
"Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.

441
00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:12.168
"I will say of the Lord. 'He is my refuge and my fortress.

442
00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:14.478
"'My God. in Him I will trust.'

443
00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:19.278
"Surely He shall deliver you from
the snare." the trap. "of the fowler."

444
00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:21.130
So. like a bird trapper.

445
00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:24.218
Peyton: Why would a bird trapper be after me?

446
00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:27.598
Well. it's used more... like...

447
00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:29.638
It's just an example. I get it.

448
00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:34.158
Continue. >>Mackenzie: "And
from the perilous pestilence."

449
00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:37.078
Mackenzie: So. like a disease. >>Like Coronavirus?

450
00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:38.078
Yep.

451
00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:42.058
"He shall cover you with His feathers
and under His wings you shall take refuge.

452
00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:44.428
"His truth shall be your shield and buckler.

453
00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:49.208
"You shall not be afraid of the terror by
night. nor of the arrow that flies by day.

454
00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:52.248
"Nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness.

455
00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:55.748
"Nor of the destruction that lays waste at noonday.

456
00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:59.778
"A thousand may fall at your
side and 10.000 at your right hand.

457
00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:03.388
"But it shall not come near you.
Only with your eyes shall you look.

458
00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:05.468
"And see the reward of the wicked.

459
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:09.258
"Because you have made the Lord.
who is my refuge. even the Most High-

460
00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:12.238
"Your dwelling place. No evil shall befall you.

461
00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:14.718
"Nor shall any plague come near your dwelling.

462
00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:19.178
Mackenzie: "For He shall give His angels
charge over you. to keep you in all your ways."

463
00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:27.348
Aedan: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

464
00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:29.478
Aedan: I... I didn't mean to scare you.

465
00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:33.430
Do - do you have a phone? Is this - Is this your home?

466
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:39.780
Do you... do you even know where we are?

467
00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:43.858
Will you say something?

468
00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:47.030
I have to go. She's - she's coming back. I'll call for help.

469
00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:50.370
Come on. you got to at least untie me.

470
00:51:57.090 --> 00:51:58.928
She's coming back. Hide.

471
00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:25.260
Listen. Listen.

472
00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:29.998
I had two more stops left after my last.

473
00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:32.100
Aedan: People are going to be looking for me.

474
00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:37.390
Did you hear me?! People are going to be looking for me!

475
00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:15.758
You okay?

476
00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:19.058
Yeah. I... I was reading to her-

477
00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:23.068
Mackenzie: -and I fell asleep.
Sorry I didn't mean to sleep in here.

478
00:55:23.110 --> 00:55:25.028
I'm surprised she didn't ask you to.

479
00:55:25.070 --> 00:55:29.058
She did. Um. I told her I would stay till she fell asleep.

480
00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:31.758
You guys got along that well. huh?

481
00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:34.460
Yeah. She's... she's special.

482
00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:37.360
She is.

483
00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:40.328
You decide where you want to sleep?

484
00:55:40.370 --> 00:55:43.190
Can I sleep in here? On the floor.

485
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:47.898
On the floor? You've got a bed and a couch.

486
00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:50.200
Yeah. I know. But...

487
00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:53.740
Whatever you want.

488
00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:56.138
Thank you.

489
00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:58.000
Let me get you some extra blankets and a pillow.

490
00:56:50.050 --> 00:56:51.500
Rise and shine!

491
00:56:56.290 --> 00:56:57.970
Good morning. Peyton.

492
00:57:02.770 --> 00:57:04.480
Let's go get breakfast.

493
00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:39.248
Come in.

494
00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:41.268
Hey.

495
00:57:41.310 --> 00:57:42.768
Did you hear the news?

496
00:57:42.810 --> 00:57:44.008
What news?

497
00:57:44.050 --> 00:57:46.748
You may have not been dreaming last week after all.

498
00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:48.418
No way.

499
00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:52.638
'Aedan Cooley's Honda CRV was
discovered by a jogger this morning.

500
00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:55.508
'Parked down a path leading to the Wheaton River.'

501
00:57:55.550 --> 00:57:57.888
But they didn't find him?

502
00:57:57.930 --> 00:58:01.958
No. It says they're waiting on forensics
but there's no immediate signs of foul play.

503
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.578
He made the rest of his deliveries that night.

504
00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:06.678
Maybe she followed him.

505
00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:09.508
You said he didn't make it
back till almost midnight. right?

506
00:58:09.550 --> 00:58:12.738
But if she was going to kill him there. why would she?

507
00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:15.548
To cover her tracks. obviously.

508
00:58:15.590 --> 00:58:19.138
She might've made those last two deliveries.

509
00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:23.868
It just doesn't make sense. Cammy.
This is all weird I know. but it's...

510
00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:26.528
...less weird to think of it like it was a dream.

511
00:58:26.570 --> 00:58:30.500
But if it wasn't Peyton could be in danger. And her mom.

512
00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:33.688
Maybe you should talk to Liz.

513
00:58:33.730 --> 00:58:36.920
I was thinking of going over there. anyways. So. maybe.

514
00:58:38.220 --> 00:58:40.510
Just make sure you babysit here from now on.

515
00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:44.320
What are you working on?

516
00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:49.078
The book that Peyton took a picture of. It was in Hindi.

517
00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:53.168
I was able to translate some
of it. It's about Anna Kuari.

518
00:58:53.210 --> 00:58:58.738
Mackenzie: 'A Hindu goddess that requires human
sacrifice to bless the harvest of her worshipers.'

519
00:58:58.780 --> 00:59:03.040
If there was a demon in that
cornfield she might have been it.

520
00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:08.860
What road did Peyton say that happened on?

521
00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:10.940
Um. Hurley Pond.

522
00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:13.560
What do you think Liz saw out there?

523
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.698
That's. um.

524
00:59:32.740 --> 00:59:35.308
That's a disturbing dream.

525
00:59:35.350 --> 00:59:36.348
Mackenzie: Uh...

526
00:59:36.390 --> 00:59:39.988
Peyton told me a little bit about
what you guys went through.

527
00:59:40.030 --> 00:59:41.988
With moving or...

528
00:59:42.030 --> 00:59:44.768
Mackenzie: Whatever happened
on the road before you moved.

529
00:59:44.810 --> 00:59:48.388
The creepy things going on around the house.

530
00:59:48.430 --> 00:59:50.948
I told her not to bring that up.

531
00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:53.738
I asked and she was scared.

532
00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:56.288
I'm sorry. but I only bring it up...

533
00:59:56.330 --> 00:59:59.628
So I can make sure that you're not in any danger.

534
00:59:59.670 --> 01:00:00.870
Either of you.

535
01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:02.400
Hm.

536
01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:09.280
Do you think something or
someone. maybe. followed you home?

537
01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:13.838
I think that Peyton had a
terrifying experience that night-

538
01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:16.938
that I made a very poor parenting decision-

539
01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:19.958
Liz: -to leave her alone in the car.

540
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.958
Liz: I think that night has
had some lasting repercussions.

541
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.368
Maybe for both of us.

542
01:00:26.410 --> 01:00:31.508
And you think that my dream was just a... crazy... dream?

543
01:00:31.550 --> 01:00:34.158
With everything that Peyton told you-

544
01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:37.158
and how creaky and creepy this house is.

545
01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:39.000
Liz: Absolutely.

546
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.948
Liz: Trust me. I'd do anything to protect Peyton.

547
01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:45.290
If I thought there was
something going on I'd handle it.

548
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.870
You've been in the basement?

549
01:00:49.570 --> 01:00:51.348
Every day.

550
01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:54.998
I put a padlock on the door outside.

551
01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:58.330
The day after you were here.
Been meaning to do that for a while.

552
01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:03.000
Want to look for yourself?

553
01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:06.540
Oh. no. That's not necessary.

554
01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:10.000
You sure?

555
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.338
Mackenzie!

556
01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:13.028
Peyton: I missed you!

557
01:02:13.070 --> 01:02:16.798
I missed you. too. I told you it
wasn't all about the money. didn't I?

558
01:02:22.110 --> 01:02:23.698
Peyton: I didn't believe you.

559
01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.470
I didn't think you'd ever come back.

560
01:02:30.770 --> 01:02:33.680
Hey. we're friends. I'm not going anywhere.

561
01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:39.658
Want to help me with some homework?

562
01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:42.500
Peyton. Don't bother her with your work.

563
01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:45.218
I don't mind.

564
01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:47.740
Please? Can she?

565
01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:51.678
Liz: She just came here to talk.
I don't know how long she has-

566
01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.248
Liz: -until her parents expect her back.

567
01:02:55.250 --> 01:03:01.188
It's up to her.

568
01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:03.000
I'm good. I've got time.

569
01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:06.590
I'll make something for lunch. then.

570
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.300
Sounds great.

571
01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:08.500
Where are you?

572
01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:12.560
Where are you?!

573
01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:16.340
I'm tired of it.

574
01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:21.690
You chased us out of our home.

575
01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:25.198
Liz: You followed us to Delaware and back.

576
01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:28.718
Liz: I don't remember the last
time I slept through the night.

577
01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:32.848
I don't remember the last time
my little girl slept through the night.

578
01:05:32.890 --> 01:05:35.478
Without waking up screaming.

579
01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:37.218
Or worse.

580
01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:39.430
Liz: And it's because of you.

581
01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:45.118
So what do you want?

582
01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:48.598
Why are you doing this to us?

583
01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:52.268
Is it because I got out of my car that night?

584
01:05:52.310 --> 01:05:54.300
Because I tried to help.

585
01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:01.000
Liz: I thought I was helping someone.

586
01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:04.640
I didn't know what you were.

587
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.238
But I do now.

588
01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:10.840
And this is ending tonight!

589
01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:15.470
You're not going to keep putting Peyton through this.

590
01:06:15.870 --> 01:06:19.300
She's gone through enough in life - she does not need it!

591
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.828
Liz: So. whatever you want -

592
01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:25.598
Keep her out of it!

593
01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:29.500
You want blood? Take it from me.

594
01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:32.490
Do you hear me? Take it from me!

595
01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.748
I heard you screaming from the
road. I almost called the police.

596
01:07:49.790 --> 01:07:51.460
Anyone else would have.

597
01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:06.590
Haley: You need help. For your sake. for Peyton's.

598
01:08:07.590 --> 01:08:10.400
But I don't want to make that choice for you.

599
01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:16.158
Unless I have to.

600
01:08:18.450 --> 01:08:22.268
Haley: I know it's not my business
but whatever made you come out here?

601
01:08:22.310 --> 01:08:25.738
And - after what happened in the bathroom
I'm worried you're a danger to yourself.

602
01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:28.640
And... and others.

603
01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:31.000
Peyton.

604
01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:53.390
Liz. Let me help you.

605
01:08:59.190 --> 01:09:00.700
Okay.

606
01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:40.548
Hey. Mac?

607
01:09:40.590 --> 01:09:41.808
Hm?

608
01:09:41.850 --> 01:09:43.118
Did you hear me?

609
01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:45.898
No. I'm sorry. What did you say?

610
01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:47.878
Peyton: I've been reading the psalm-

611
01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:49.618
Every night since you read it to me.

612
01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:52.210
I haven't had any nightmares since then.

613
01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.400
That's a start.
