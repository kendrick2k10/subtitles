\h\h\h\h\h\hGuys.
did you hear that?

133
00:12:49.239 --> 00:12:50.878
"Medical reasons."

134
00:12:50.878 --> 00:12:53.078
I had a minor physical ailment.
That’s it.

135
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:56.180
So. pipe down.
\h\hboy band.

136
00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:58.050
\h\h\h\h\hI know they say
fake it ’till you make it.

137
00:12:58.050 --> 00:12:59.348
\h\h\hbut sometimes
a man’s got to admit

138
00:12:59.348 --> 00:13:01.086
\h\h\hthat he just
doesn’t know shit.

139
00:13:02.417 --> 00:13:03.858
And he never will.

140
00:13:05.255 --> 00:13:07.026
\h\h\hAnd you’ve got
a long way to go...

141
00:13:08.225 --> 00:13:11.591
\h’till you’re even close
to being a man. that is.

142
00:13:13.362 --> 00:13:15.969
\h\h\hSo. how soon
’til judgment day?

143
00:13:20.039 --> 00:13:21.172
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h
You know what? I...

144
00:13:22.503 --> 00:13:24.571

\habout whatever it was
you were talking about.

147
00:13:32.282 --> 00:13:33.415
I’m serious.

148
00:13:35.615 --> 00:13:37.353
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hHow long
do you think we have?

149
00:13:41.456 --> 00:13:42.622
A week?

150
00:13:45.933 --> 00:13:47.066
Two?

151
00:13:53.468 --> 00:13:55.305
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h
It’s not judgment day.

152
00:13:58.506 --> 00:14:00.145
They’re calling it
\h\h"The Razing."

153
00:14:05.381 --> 00:14:06.954
\h\hYou’re smarter
than this. Ellen.

154
00:14:07.548 --> 00:14:08.890
Am I?

155
00:14:12.124 --> 00:14:14.896
\hSee. I thought I was.
but now I’m not so sure.

156
00:14:17.492 --> 00:14:20.198
See. I don’t believe in God.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNever had.

\h\h\h\h\hit’s the same thing.

160
00:14:25.599 --> 00:14:28.668
So. when one of them
\h\h\hwrites a poem

161
00:14:28.668 --> 00:14:31.110

162
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:32.342
that’s not dad.

163
00:14:33.343 --> 00:14:36.610

164
00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:40.482
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hhis mom.
who moments before was on fire

165
00:14:40.482 --> 00:14:42.154
burning alive

166
00:14:42.154 --> 00:14:45.487

\h\hheld her...

167
00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:49.491
\h\h\h\h\h\hHis mother
wept as she screamed.

168
00:14:49.491 --> 00:14:51.097
And-- and what?

169
00:14:51.097 --> 00:14:53.594
\h\h\hYou think he was
some sort of messiah?

170
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.103
\h\h\h\hHe was
a wife beater.

171
00:14:57.103 --> 00:14:59.006
That poem
\h\hDomestic Abuse.

172
00:14:59.006 --> 00:15:00.337
Is that what
my student called it?

173
00:15:01.701 --> 00:15:03.340
\hHe called it
Backward Rainbow

174
00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.671
because that is what this guy
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hlooked like

175
00:15:04.671 --> 00:15:06.310
after his mom died.

176
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:08.345
\h\h\h\h\hJust as his dad
picked him up to hug him.

177
00:15:08.345 --> 00:15:11.348
\h\h\h\hjust as-- the same dad
who hugged his burning mother.

178
00:15:11.348 --> 00:15:14.549
the same dad whose own skin
\h\h\h\h\hwas blemish-free.

179
00:15:16.287 --> 00:15:17.420
And you saw that?

180
00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.652
I saw him

181
00:15:18.652 --> 00:15:21.424
\h\h\hand there was
not one burn on him.

182
00:15:22.623 --> 00:15:25.593
\h\h\h\hI saw his son
scared to death of him

183
00:15:25.593 --> 00:15:28.431
and even more scared of CPS
\h\hwhen they came to court.

184
00:15:28.431 --> 00:15:31.566
\h\h\h\h\hSeriously. Ellie.
you should be up for tenure.

185
00:15:31.566 --> 00:15:34.371
not deciphering the tales
\h\h\h\hof fourth graders.

186
00:15:34.371 --> 00:15:37.044
\h\h\h\hOnce upon a time.
there was a fucked-up kid.

187
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.573
The end.

188
00:15:40.641 --> 00:15:41.983
Maybe.

189
00:15:43.512 --> 00:15:44.645
But maybe...

190
00:15:46.746 --> 00:15:48.385
just maybe...

191
00:15:50.123 --> 00:15:53.588
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hwe have to admit
that maybe we don’t know shit.

192
00:15:56.459 --> 00:15:59.165
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hMaybe we are all
just getting what we deserve.

193
00:16:02.168 --> 00:16:03.301
We?

194
00:16:22.353 --> 00:16:24.553
\h\h\h\h\h\hIt’s fine.
It’s fine. She’s fine.

195
00:16:25.785 --> 00:16:27.160
Everything’s fine.

196
00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.294
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h
She doesn’t look fine.

197
00:16:29.294 --> 00:16:31.098
How the fuck
\h\hwould you know?

198
00:16:31.098 --> 00:16:34.167
\h\hYou-- you-- you--
you waltz back in here

199
00:16:34.167 --> 00:16:36.334
\h\h\hlike-- like
you’re some hero.

200
00:16:36.334 --> 00:16:38.369
\h\hsome knight
in shining shit.

201
00:16:38.369 --> 00:16:39.700
and-- and she just laps it up

202
00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:41.339
\hlike you’ve never
burned her before.

203
00:16:41.339 --> 00:16:44.144
Like you’re not gonna do
\h\hthe same thing again

204
00:16:44.144 --> 00:16:47.081
\h\h\h\h\h\hnext week.
next month. next year.

205
00:16:47.081 --> 00:16:50.282
\h\h\hBecause she knows
that after you are gone.

206
00:16:50.282 --> 00:16:52.614
I will still be here
\hto bandage her up.

207
00:16:52.614 --> 00:16:53.747
to pick her up.

208
00:16:53.747 --> 00:16:57.751
\h\h\hSo. yeah. I think
I know when she’s fine.

209
00:17:05.825 --> 00:17:07.365
And she’s fine.

210
00:17:10.467 --> 00:17:11.666
We are fine.

211
00:17:25.746 --> 00:17:27.088
What the fuck?

212
00:17:31.818 --> 00:17:33.259
Fucking breaker.

213
00:18:07.227 --> 00:18:09.196
I just wanna
\h\hbe alone. okay?

214
00:18:12.727 --> 00:18:14.696
Why the hell
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hdid you do that?

215
00:18:18.799 --> 00:18:20.471
\h\h-Do you?

216
00:18:20.471 --> 00:18:21.703
Do you really?

217
00:18:23.309 --> 00:18:25.905
’Cause-- ’cause
\hif you don’t.

218
00:18:25.905 --> 00:18:29.513
\hthis place.
and with him.

219
00:18:29.513 --> 00:18:30.910
\h\h\h\h\h\hit’s not
where you wanna be.

220
00:18:32.846 --> 00:18:34.782
\h\h\h\hAnd if you
do wanna be alone.

221
00:18:34.782 --> 00:18:36.685
\h\h\hthen you better
get used to this room.

222
00:18:36.685 --> 00:18:38.918
\hbecause this is as close to
them as you’re ever gonna get.

223
00:18:42.625 --> 00:18:44.165
Why do you bother?

224
00:18:44.792 --> 00:18:45.925
Why don’t you just...

225
00:18:48.433 --> 00:18:49.599
Leave?

226
00:18:54.934 --> 00:18:56.540
-We made a pact.
\h\h\h\h\h-Pact.

227
00:19:00.544 --> 00:19:01.677
Was it worth it?

228
00:19:05.384 --> 00:19:06.517
\h\h\hI used
to think so.

229
00:19:10.422 --> 00:19:11.951
\h\h\hI’ve never been
the sentimental type.

230
00:19:11.951 --> 00:19:14.492
\h\h\h\h\hYou know.
birthdays. holidays.

231
00:19:14.492 --> 00:19:15.790
\h\h\h\h\hI really
could give a shit.

232
00:19:20.564 --> 00:19:21.862
When I was a kid...

233
00:19:23.336 --> 00:19:25.404
when I met them.
\h\h\h\hI was...

234
00:19:26.603 --> 00:19:27.901
\h\hI was going
through a lot...

235
00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:30.673
with my mom.

236
00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.943
\h\h\h\hI ran away
a couple of times.

237
00:19:39.847 --> 00:19:41.288
Anyway. it got bad.

238
00:19:41.288 --> 00:19:45.886
\h\h\hGot to a point where I-- I
didn’t even wanted to be found.

239
00:19:49.461 --> 00:19:50.792
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hBut when
that lot showed up...

240
00:19:53.762 --> 00:19:55.599
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI realized
you can still be alone...

241
00:19:58.701 --> 00:19:59.834
even when you’re not.

242
00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:02.936
And to me...

243
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:06.643
at the time...

244
00:20:07.644 --> 00:20:09.943
\h\hin some weird.
screwed-up way...

245
00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:15.553
it felt a lot better
\hthan being alone.

246
00:20:23.528 --> 00:20:24.760
So. you stayed?

247
00:20:27.796 --> 00:20:28.929
I stayed.

248
00:20:30.601 --> 00:20:31.767
So. does it still...

249
00:20:33.505 --> 00:20:34.638
feel better?

250
00:20:38.906 --> 00:20:40.039
\h
You tell me.

251
00:20:44.483 --> 00:20:45.781
\h\h\h\h-
-What happened with your ma?

252
00:20:53.855 --> 00:20:54.988
\h\h\h\h
So. you’re coming?

253
00:21:02.468 --> 00:21:03.964
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI think
I’m gonna wait it out too.

254
00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:12.038

255
00:21:12.038 --> 00:21:14.909

-What’s the point. genius?

316
00:26:01.734 --> 00:26:04.330
\hThis isn’t some
fucking chem lab!

317
00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:05.771
We play it safe.

00:26:21.721 --> 00:26:23.789
You know the new
stuff’s fine. right?

319
00:26:23.789 --> 00:26:25.021
My ma tested it.

320
00:26:25.021 --> 00:26:26.121
On who?

321
00:26:26.121 --> 00:26:27.287
You?

322
00:26:27.287 --> 00:26:30.191
\h\h\h\h\hNo offense. Linc.
but hasn’t your mom lost it?

323
00:26:30.191 --> 00:26:32.259
\hAnd I don’t just mean all
credibility and credentials.

324
00:26:32.259 --> 00:26:34.063
\h\h\h\h\h\hI meant
she’s batshit cray.

325
00:26:41.675 --> 00:26:42.841
It’s cool.

326
00:26:44.238 --> 00:26:45.811
\h\hI shouldn’t
have said that.

327
00:26:45.811 --> 00:26:47.747
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYour mom’s
always been good to us.

328
00:26:47.747 --> 00:26:50.178
\h\h\h\h\hYou
got it right the first time.

329
00:26:56.921 --> 00:26:59.319
I was just shocked that you
\h\h\hused the word "cray."

330
00:26:59.319 --> 00:27:02.322
\h\h\h\h\hMaybe I took

\hshould we take?

518
00:44:28.708 --> 00:44:30.006
You should get
\h\hsome rest.

00:44:32.811 --> 00:44:34.879
We should take
\hthe red one.

520

It’s pretty.

even count...

619
00:54:02.677 --> 00:54:04.646
\h\hwhen the only person
who’s been there for you

620
00:54:04.646 --> 00:54:07.044
\h\h\his only there because
your family paid him to be?

\h\h\hdeath for so long...

635
00:55:43.481 --> 00:55:44.614

\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h

641
00:56:11.575 --> 00:56:15.414

how I don’t even know who I am.

643
00:56:18.945 --> 00:56:20.749
I don’t even know
what that means.

644
00:56:30.088 --> 00:56:32.497
\h\hThey always told me
that it didn’t matter...

645
00:56:34.994 --> 00:56:37.062
that I don’t matter.

646
00:56:40.131 --> 00:56:41.803
But the problem is...

647
00:56:46.005 --> 00:56:49.547
The problem is when you
don’t know who you are.

648
00:56:49.547 --> 00:56:51.450
\h\hyou start to feel

650
00:57:05.926 --> 00:57:09.501

\h\hgo to the bathroom.

651
00:57:10.997 --> 00:57:12.471

00:57:36.187 --> 00:57:39.190
Well. you know. I mean.
\h\h\h\hit’s just not...

659
00:57:40.631 --> 00:57:41.962
It’s not what you
\h\hreally go for.

660
00:57:41.962 --> 00:57:46.769
\h\hWell. I mean.
that’s the point.

661
00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:20.132
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h
So what did you see. loser?

662
00:58:20.132 --> 00:58:22.266
Nothing
I already didn’t know.

663
00:58:23.674 --> 00:58:24.741
\h\h
I don’t even lie.

664
00:58:25.742 --> 00:58:27.271
\h\h
All right. Okay.

665
00:58:28.272 --> 00:58:29.977
There. Done.

666
00:58:32.309 --> 00:58:35.015
-Surprise. surprise.
\h-Yeah.

667
00:58:35.884 --> 00:58:37.787
Ray. it’s hard to start.

668
00:59:21.699 --> 00:59:22.997
Oh. lambchop.

669
00:59:22.997 --> 00:59:26.297
Lambchop.

670
00:59:26.297 --> 00:59:28.299
Is that mine?

671
00:59:35.845 --> 00:59:39.277
\hYou fucking
little freeloader.

672
00:59:39.277 --> 00:59:42.885
\hAll up in my shit.
tripping on my shit.

673
00:59:42.885 --> 00:59:45.250
What fucking good
\hare you anyway?

674
00:59:45.250 --> 00:59:46.790
Hey?

675
00:59:50.827 --> 00:59:54.765
\h\h\h\h\hDid I tell you
why I call you Lambchop?

676
00:59:54.765 --> 00:59:58.131
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-Yeah. Ma.
-Shut your fucking mouth!

677
00:59:58.131 --> 01:00:00.067
\h\h\hDid I say
you could speak?

678
01:00:00.639 --> 01:00:01.970
Sit down!

679
01:00:04.137 --> 01:00:08.273
\hI said sit down!
Sit your ass down!

680
01:00:17.183 --> 01:00:19.691
This is my story.

681
01:00:19.691 --> 01:00:20.824
My story.

682
01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:23.057
One night.

683
01:00:23.057 --> 01:00:26.390
one shitty fucking night.

684
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:30.130
while I was walking home
\h\h\h\hfrom university.

685
01:00:30.130 --> 01:00:32.033
walking down this

686
01:00:32.033 --> 01:00:35.003
this shitty ass street...

687
01:00:40.338 --> 01:00:42.681
...when I heard you.

688
01:00:42.681 --> 01:00:47.180
\h\h\h\ha tiny. tiny
little baby crying.

689
01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:50.986
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h
No. no. wailing. wailing.

690
01:00:50.986 --> 01:00:55.221
\h\h\h\h\hI heard you wailing
like a lamb being slaughtered.

691
01:00:56.090 --> 01:00:58.059
\h\hAnd-- and
what did I do?

692
01:00:59.225 --> 01:01:00.831
What did I do?

693
01:01:05.330 --> 01:01:08.333
\h\h\h\hI asked you
a goddamn question!

694
01:01:09.972 --> 01:01:11.270
What did I do?

695
01:01:13.745 --> 01:01:15.010
You took me in.

696
01:01:19.113 --> 01:01:20.785
That’s right.

697
01:01:20.785 --> 01:01:22.347
I...

698
01:01:22.347 --> 01:01:25.185
took you in.

699
01:01:33.292 --> 01:01:36.867
Every inch of your life.

700
01:01:36.867 --> 01:01:40.200
every ounce of your being

701
01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:44.941
\h\h\h\h\h\h\his only there
because I allowed it to be.

702
01:01:58.515 --> 01:02:00.352
Don’t you forget that.

703
01:02:20.504 --> 01:02:23.782
\h\hI should have left you
where I fucking found you.

704
01:02:24.948 --> 01:02:27.852
They don’t pay me enough
\h\h\h\h\hfor this shit.

705
01:02:28.545 --> 01:02:31.790
\h\h\hRaised you
on my own dime.

706
01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:33.517
No one helped me.

707
01:02:33.517 --> 01:02:37.059
\h\h\h\hThat’s what you get
for trying to help somebody.

708
01:02:37.059 --> 01:02:38.423
Fuck off!

709
01:02:38.423 --> 01:02:39.556
Nothing.

710
01:02:40.161 --> 01:02:41.965
Nada...

711
01:02:41.965 --> 01:02:44.033
is what I should have
\h\h\h\h\h\hnamed you.

712
01:02:44.033 --> 01:02:46.101
\hI tried to name you
after someone great.

713
01:02:46.101 --> 01:02:48.268
\h\hTried to give you
a chance. that’s all.

714
01:02:50.875 --> 01:02:53.075
\h\h\h\h\h\hBut nada’s
what you’ll always be.

715
01:02:55.275 --> 01:02:57.112
I can’t change
\hyour destiny.

716
01:03:02.546 --> 01:03:04.284
Not yet anyway.

717
01:03:39.121 --> 01:03:42.520
\h\h-

718
01:04:06.115 --> 01:04:07.919
\h\h\hYour mom’s
out on the couch again.

719
01:04:13.958 --> 01:04:15.927
\hShe can’t move
much these days.

720
01:04:15.927 --> 01:04:19.931
\hCircle of life. huh?
The mother becomes the baby?

721
01:04:19.931 --> 01:04:22.934
-Soon. you’re wiping her ass.
\h\h\h\h\h\h-I don’t think so.

722
01:04:23.594 --> 01:04:25.002
Tell my cousin that.

723
01:04:26.201 --> 01:04:27.499
It happens to all of us.

724
01:04:28.269 --> 01:04:29.402
No. not me.

725
01:04:29.402 --> 01:04:31.371
\h\h\h\h\hI-- I think
that’s enough of that.

726
01:04:32.174 --> 01:04:33.945
So fucking Lincoln.

727
01:04:33.945 --> 01:04:36.178
\h\h\h\h\h\hAlways thinks
he’s above everyone else.

728
01:04:38.411 --> 01:04:40.479
-No. that’s not true.
\h\h\h\h\h-No?

729
01:04:41.084 --> 01:04:42.217
No.

730
01:04:43.922 --> 01:04:45.616
I just don’t want to be
\h\hlike everyone else.

731
01:04:45.616 --> 01:04:47.420
\hOh. so you don’t want
special treatment. then?

732
01:04:49.587 --> 01:04:51.259
Guess you wouldn’t want
\h\h\hthese test answers

733
01:04:51.259 --> 01:04:52.623
for next week’s final.

734
01:04:52.623 --> 01:04:55.131
Guess you wouldn’t
\h\h\hwant these.

735
01:05:04.173 --> 01:05:06.538
\h\h-You know the deal.
-It’s all on the table.

736
01:05:06.538 --> 01:05:09.178
-It’s all I have.
-It’s not enough.

737
01:05:11.147 --> 01:05:13.215
I can get you more

738
01:05:13.215 --> 01:05:15.250
at a party tonight.

739
01:05:17.989 --> 01:05:20.453
So. you’re coming or what?

740
01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:25.392
\h\h\hHon. it wouldn’t
be a party without me.

741
01:05:54.454 --> 01:05:55.653
Are you okay?

742
01:05:59.426 --> 01:06:01.197
You don’t gotta do
\h\ha taste test.

743
01:06:01.197 --> 01:06:03.298
\h\h\h\h\h\hYou should not
gonna know the difference

744
01:06:03.298 --> 01:06:04.629
after half a 12-pack.

745
01:06:04.629 --> 01:06:08.732
\h\h\hBut unless you wanna
prolong your pain in hers.

746
01:06:08.732 --> 01:06:11.141
\h\hI would recommend doing
a different type of poison.

747
01:06:17.444 --> 01:06:20.414
An entire pharmacy
at your fingertips.

748
01:06:23.186 --> 01:06:26.156
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hWhy plan a murder
when you’ve got a suicide note?

749
01:06:28.026 --> 01:06:29.357
Apathetic.

750
01:06:30.424 --> 01:06:32.096
Go with the benzos.

751
01:06:32.096 --> 01:06:34.626
They’re perfect for a drunk
\h\h\h\h\hwith a death wish.

752
01:07:40.593 --> 01:07:41.759
I missed you.

753
01:07:41.759 --> 01:07:43.596
I missed you too.

754
01:07:55.509 --> 01:07:56.708
It doesn’t matter.

755
01:07:56.708 --> 01:07:58.677
Yes. it does.

756
01:08:00.448 --> 01:08:01.713
Why won’t you tell me?

757
01:08:05.255 --> 01:08:06.553
There’s nothing to tell.

758
01:08:09.292 --> 01:08:10.656
You’re sick. Corey.

759
01:08:13.692 --> 01:08:14.891
Do I look sick?

760
01:08:34.416 --> 01:08:35.780
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hOh!

761
01:08:37.254 --> 01:08:39.355
\h\h\h\h\hTrying to keep
all the fun to yourself.

762
01:08:39.355 --> 01:08:40.521
Are you?

763
01:08:48.298 --> 01:08:49.497
Two tickets...

764
01:08:51.565 --> 01:08:53.171
to Wonderland. my lady.

765
01:08:55.899 --> 01:08:57.406
Whoa! Wait up.

766
01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:03.313
So. where’s the snow at?

767
01:09:04.710 --> 01:09:05.942
You’ve got it.

768
01:09:05.942 --> 01:09:09.484
Nah. this is that heavy shit
\h\hwe did at Linc’s place.

769
01:09:09.484 --> 01:09:12.355
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI want them
Winter Wonder Dreams. baby.

770
01:09:13.455 --> 01:09:14.687
Oh. baby.

771
01:09:14.687 --> 01:09:17.855
\h\h\h\h\hYou and the clink
over there may rule your...

772
01:09:17.855 --> 01:09:19.923
\hwhatever shithole
you guys are from.

773
01:09:19.923 --> 01:09:22.530
When you’re in my house.

774
01:09:22.530 --> 01:09:23.696
know when to shut up.

775
01:09:24.829 --> 01:09:26.435
\h\h\h
This is the one?

776
01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:30.769
Yeah.
\h\h\hwould that be?

777
01:09:30.769 --> 01:09:32.672
\hYou really
don’t know. do you?

778
01:09:32.672 --> 01:09:34.476
You’re really that cliché?

779
01:09:34.476 --> 01:09:37.743
You daddy’s boys
\h\hare all the fucking same.

780
01:09:37.743 --> 01:09:40.515
\h\h\h\h\hFancy and empty.
just like this sweet pad.

781
01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:44.717
Isn’t this supposed to be
\h\h\h\ha birthday party?

782
01:09:44.717 --> 01:09:48.490
Pretty sweet birthday party.
\h\h\hNo family. no friends.

783
01:09:48.490 --> 01:09:50.492
He has friends. He has us.

784
01:09:50.492 --> 01:09:51.724
Does he really?

785
01:09:53.627 --> 01:09:54.892
Are you really?

786
01:10:02.306 --> 01:10:03.736
So. prove it.

787
01:10:06.002 --> 01:10:09.247
\h\h-A game of True Blue.
-No. I don’t do that shit.

788
01:10:09.247 --> 01:10:12.613
You was about to do that shit
with your missus just before.

789
01:10:12.613 --> 01:10:14.516
\h\h\h\h
That was different.

790
01:10:14.516 --> 01:10:18.256
\h\h\h\h\h\hWhy? Because your
shithole is shinier than ours?

791
01:10:18.256 --> 01:10:19.554
\h\h\h\h\h\hYou think
you’re better than us?

792
01:10:19.554 --> 01:10:21.457
He didn’t say that.

793
01:10:21.457 --> 01:10:24.262
Nah. but he meant it. though.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hHe meant it.

794
01:10:24.262 --> 01:10:26.594
\h\h\h\hThere’s always
exceptions to you lot.

795
01:10:26.594 --> 01:10:27.859
Rules to suit you.

796
01:10:27.859 --> 01:10:28.992
\h\h\h\h\h
And so. what if we do?

797
01:10:29.762 --> 01:10:31.269
What’s it to you. huh?

798
01:10:31.269 --> 01:10:33.271
\h\h\h\hDo I tell you
how to live your life?

799
01:10:33.271 --> 01:10:35.438
Do I get in your face
and remind you of all

800
01:10:35.438 --> 01:10:38.034
the shit that you were born
\h\h\hwith and wanna forget?

801
01:10:38.034 --> 01:10:39.442
\h\h\h\h\h
I think I remember you

802
01:10:39.442 --> 01:10:40.641
doing exactly that.

803
01:10:49.881 --> 01:10:51.322
Give me the snow.

804
01:11:01.057 --> 01:11:02.696
\h\h\h\h-It’s yours.

805
01:11:03.631 --> 01:11:04.764
Ladies first.

806
01:11:12.871 --> 01:11:14.411
One for me.

807
01:11:28.656 --> 01:11:29.789
Any day?

808
01:11:29.789 --> 01:11:31.758
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hSorry.
I didn’t see you there.

809
01:11:34.596 --> 01:11:35.927
Sweet dreams.

810
01:11:45.706 --> 01:11:47.576
Shoot. Candles.

811
01:11:49.105 --> 01:11:51.008
\h\h\h\hCan’t have
a birthday without a wish?

812
01:11:53.483 --> 01:11:54.880
I recommend the milk.

813
01:11:55.683 --> 01:11:57.047
Takes care of the booze.

814
01:11:57.817 --> 01:11:59.115
Then. no. thanks.

815
01:12:18.673 --> 01:12:20.136
I must have left one in.

816
01:12:21.742 --> 01:12:22.875
Must have.

817
01:12:31.917 --> 01:12:34.117
-I’m not wearing pants?
\h\h\h\h\h\h-Oh. sorry.

818
01:12:44.963 --> 01:12:46.899
\h\hThis night has brought
a lot of things to light.

819
01:12:46.899 --> 01:12:48.065
don’t you think?

820
01:12:50.441 --> 01:12:51.640
Sorry.

821
01:12:54.742 --> 01:12:55.941
Um...

822
01:12:55.941 --> 01:12:58.647
you-- you-- you see
things differently.

823
01:12:59.945 --> 01:13:01.111
I can tell.

824
01:13:02.948 --> 01:13:04.917
\h\hYou see things
