00:00:45.697 --> 00:00:49.092
Be advised.
we are in a bad situation

4
00:00:49.136 --> 00:00:51.616
that we can't really
get spots on ground.

5
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.879
Jimmy. hey.
we're on the west side.

6
00:00:53.923 --> 00:00:56.230

8
00:01:56.681 --> 00:01:59.119
Hey. Duff! Ford's been hit.

9
00:01:59.162 --> 00:02:00.729
We gotta go back for him.

10
00:02:02.687 --> 00:02:04.341
Let's move.

11
00:02:04.385 --> 00:02:06.300
Duff. let's go! Come on!

12
00:02:13.916 --> 00:02:15.047
Contact!

13
00:02:23.404 --> 00:02:25.232
Let's go. Come on.

14
00:02:36.721 --> 00:02:39.159
Hey. You're okay. Look at me.

15
00:02:39.202 --> 00:02:41.378
Look at me.
You're okay. You're okay.

16
00:02:41.422 --> 00:02:43.728
I need you to breathe.
Breathe.

17
00:02:43.772 --> 00:02:47.036
Hey. we don't fucking die.
We don't fucking die.

18
00:03:23.115 --> 00:03:24.160
Thanks a lot. brother.

19
00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:54.930
What can I get you. papi?

20
00:03:54.973 --> 00:03:56.236
Anything cold.

21
00:04:04.983 --> 00:04:06.942
Yeah. that's right.

22
00:04:06.985 --> 00:04:08.248
Go ahead. deal them up.

23
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.252
Fuck me.

24
00:04:15.342 --> 00:04:16.952
You got a problem. chief?

25
00:04:16.995 --> 00:04:19.302
No. no problem here.

26
00:04:19.346 --> 00:04:23.350
I was wondering
if you could get one more in.

27
00:04:23.393 --> 00:04:25.656
You got money. we'd be happy
to take it off you.

28
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.701
What's the buy-in?

29
00:04:26.744 --> 00:04:27.745
Two hundred dollars.

30
00:04:30.182 --> 00:04:31.183
What about this?

31
00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:39.235
Make room for the stranger.
boys.

32
00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.063
He just paid for a place.

33
00:04:41.106 --> 00:04:44.327
Two hundred dollars.
Don't spend it all at once.

34
00:05:06.393 --> 00:05:09.309
I see you. and I'm all in.

35
00:05:16.098 --> 00:05:18.230
Quite a poker face you have.
chief.

36
00:05:19.231 --> 00:05:20.494
Only face I got.

37
00:05:20.537 --> 00:05:22.191
Hmm...

38
00:05:22.234 --> 00:05:25.977
Just showed you my ball sack.
What you gonna do?

39
00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:27.544
Heh. I'm a little light.

40
00:05:29.024 --> 00:05:30.460
Yeah. you are.

41
00:05:32.984 --> 00:05:35.073
The fuck
you think you're doing?

42
00:05:37.032 --> 00:05:38.860
I'm winning.

43
00:05:38.903 --> 00:05:42.037
Fucking son of a bitch.
You're a fucking cheater.

44
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.255
Give me the watch.

45
00:05:46.433 --> 00:05:48.391
Try and take it.
asshole.

46
00:05:51.307 --> 00:05:53.396
I think I'll just
let my boys decide.

47
00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:02.449
Hey!

48
00:06:04.494 --> 00:06:07.279
Jesus fucking Christ!

49
00:06:07.323 --> 00:06:09.586
You are a bad motherfucker.

50
00:06:12.459 --> 00:06:15.244
I can't kick your ass.

51
00:06:15.287 --> 00:06:18.073
I should shoot you
right where you fucking stand.

52
00:06:18.116 --> 00:06:19.379
I'm standing right here.

53
00:06:21.468 --> 00:06:24.079
You ain't taking my bike.

54
00:06:24.122 --> 00:06:26.081
You can keep
the fucking bike.

55
00:06:26.124 --> 00:06:28.562
I'm taking my money
and I'm taking my watch.

56
00:06:39.486 --> 00:06:43.054
You fucking guys are pathetic.
Jesus Christ!

57
00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:56.938
How you doing?

58
00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:16.174
Fosco.

59
00:07:17.524 --> 00:07:19.351
Yeah. that's right.
It's Max. Uh-huh.

60
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.224
Yeah. I'm back in town. baby.

61
00:07:22.267 --> 00:07:24.139
Hey. listen.
let me ask you a question.

62
00:07:24.182 --> 00:07:26.446
Still having that.
uh. thing tomorrow?

63
00:07:27.664 --> 00:07:29.013
Uh-huh.

64
00:07:29.057 --> 00:07:30.493
Yeah. I'll be there.

65
00:07:30.537 --> 00:07:32.669
And I'm bringing a friend
with me too.

66
00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:25.565
-Hey.
-Hey.

67
00:09:27.697 --> 00:09:29.133
I know you?

68
00:09:29.177 --> 00:09:31.788
No. I. um. just wanted to--

69
00:09:35.749 --> 00:09:38.186
All right.
we'll go with the hard sell.

70
00:09:40.449 --> 00:09:41.450
All right. look.

71
00:09:42.669 --> 00:09:43.800
The name's Max.

72
00:09:48.805 --> 00:09:51.591
I was in the bar last night.
I saw you in action.

73
00:09:52.287 --> 00:09:55.725
I gotta tell you. you got some
amazing skills. my friend.

74
00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.467
So. look. how about this?

75
00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:00.469
How about you let a brother
buy you breakfast

76
00:10:00.512 --> 00:10:01.557
while you hear me out?

77
00:10:03.298 --> 00:10:06.606
You know. some eggs. some bacon.
maybe a little chorizo.

78
00:10:07.694 --> 00:10:08.651
Listen...

79
00:10:10.348 --> 00:10:11.654
if you don't like

80
00:10:11.698 --> 00:10:13.830
what I have to say.
if you're not interested.

81
00:10:13.874 --> 00:10:16.441
then. hey.
we can just part ways.

82
00:10:16.485 --> 00:10:18.182
No harm. no foul.

83
00:10:18.226 --> 00:10:21.490
Besides. breakfast is the
cheapest meal of the day anyway.

84
00:10:25.799 --> 00:10:28.715
I know you don't know me.
but I know fighters.

85
00:10:28.758 --> 00:10:34.329
And that skillset you got there
could be a fucking gold mine...

86
00:10:34.372 --> 00:10:37.201
if it were to be exploited
by the right per--

87
00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:44.687
That's a great speech. man.

88
00:10:44.731 --> 00:10:47.168
I got no desire
to be exploited.

89
00:10:47.211 --> 00:10:48.735
-Just--
-My country did that.

90
00:11:03.488 --> 00:11:06.622
All right.
look. just tell me...

91
00:11:09.581 --> 00:11:11.540
how much money
did you make last night?

92
00:11:11.583 --> 00:11:12.541
Enough.

93
00:11:12.584 --> 00:11:15.587
Enough for what.
hmm?

94
00:11:15.631 --> 00:11:19.722
One. maybe two more nights
in some shitty motel?

95
00:11:19.766 --> 00:11:22.377
What if you could make enough
to stay in a decent place for.

96
00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.206
I don't know. a month?
Maybe even more.

97
00:11:25.249 --> 00:11:27.904
I would tell you that I'm not
one for laying down roots.

98
00:11:27.948 --> 00:11:30.472
There has to be something
that you want. right?

99
00:11:31.603 --> 00:11:32.866
Come on.
Something that you need.

100
00:11:32.909 --> 00:11:34.215
Everybody needs
something.

101
00:11:34.258 --> 00:11:35.520
I don't need anything. man.

102
00:11:35.564 --> 00:11:37.435
Everything I need
is right in that bag.

103
00:11:39.611 --> 00:11:42.919
Well I can tell you what you're
not gonna find in that bag.

104
00:11:42.963 --> 00:11:44.529
Enlighten me.

105
00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:46.270
An outlet.

106
00:11:47.489 --> 00:11:48.664
Yeah.

107
00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:49.970
Uh-huh.

108
00:11:50.013 --> 00:11:51.319
I saw you last night.

109
00:11:52.929 --> 00:11:55.540
More importantly.
I saw that look in your face.

110
00:11:55.584 --> 00:11:57.064
That look in your eyes.

111
00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.720
You didn't just wanna
choke that clown out.

112
00:12:00.763 --> 00:12:02.591
You wanted to make sure
he understood

113
00:12:02.634 --> 00:12:04.419
that you had something

114
00:12:04.462 --> 00:12:05.812
that you were trying
to prove to the world--

115
00:12:05.855 --> 00:12:08.597
Hey. hey. hey. Don't think
that you fucking know me.

116
00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.425
-I didn't say that I know you.
-Don't.

117
00:12:10.468 --> 00:12:12.340
I didn't say
that I know you.

118
00:12:12.383 --> 00:12:14.777
But I do know
that fucking look.

119
00:12:16.561 --> 00:12:19.564
It's the same look
my brother had

120
00:12:19.608 --> 00:12:21.828
when he came home
from Afghanistan.

121
00:12:23.481 --> 00:12:25.396
It was probably
the same look he had

122
00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.486
when he put that goddamn Glock
in his mouth

123
00:12:29.618 --> 00:12:30.880
and he squeezed the trigger.

124
00:12:39.062 --> 00:12:41.456
Last night I did
what I had to do. That's it.

125
00:12:41.499 --> 00:12:43.327
Yeah. I understand that.

126
00:12:45.373 --> 00:12:48.506
But you got a lot of anger
inside you...

127
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:51.466
and if you don't find a way
to let that shit out.

128
00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:53.033
it's gonna eat you alive.

129
00:12:56.993 --> 00:12:58.734
You're full of shit.

130
00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:01.650
And if you don't get it out.
that shit will eat you alive.

131
00:13:01.693 --> 00:13:02.825
-Mm-hm.
-Uh-huh.

Shocker.

350
00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:59.367
Look at you.
Building and fixing things.

351
00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:01.630
Well. Max said
I had to earn my keep.

352
00:25:01.674 --> 00:25:03.545
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

353
00:25:03.589 --> 00:25:06.113
Oh. I fixed your sink too.
It had no pressure.

354
00:25:06.156 --> 00:25:07.593
What? That's amazing. thank you.

355
00:25:07.636 --> 00:25:08.898
You're welcome.

356
00:25:08.942 --> 00:25:11.074
It's nice to have
some real help around here.

357
00:25:11.118 --> 00:25:12.641
Oh. and I fixed
your bathroom light.

358
00:25:13.686 --> 00:25:14.687
You're welcome.

359
00:25:15.818 --> 00:25:17.211
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

360
00:25:17.254 --> 00:25:18.386
Get-- Go in the house.

361
00:25:19.561 --> 00:25:21.041
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

362
00:25:27.787 --> 00:25:28.788
Sage.

363
00:25:30.224 --> 00:25:32.618
Max Bomer.
I heard you were out.

364
00:25:32.661 --> 00:25:34.576
Yeah. Made parole
about two weeks ago.

365
00:25:35.621 --> 00:25:37.448
Two weeks?

366
00:25:37.492 --> 00:25:39.755
-Uh-huh.
-Man. that's a long time.

367
00:25:41.757 --> 00:25:43.542
I thought
we were friends. Max.

368
00:25:43.585 --> 00:25:44.673
I didn't hear from you once.

369
00:25:44.717 --> 00:25:46.762
You didn't call.
You didn't DM me.

370
00:25:46.806 --> 00:25:49.373
I was on the road.
all right?

371
00:25:49.417 --> 00:25:51.245
But I'm here now.

372
00:25:51.288 --> 00:25:52.333
Yes. you are.

373
00:25:54.857 --> 00:25:56.076
Where's my fucking money?

374
00:26:00.123 --> 00:26:02.822
Now. look. obviously
it's not all of it.

375
00:26:02.865 --> 00:26:07.609
But it's just. you know.
a good faith gesture. you know.

376
00:26:07.653 --> 00:26:09.306
-Oh. is that it?
-Yeah.

377
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:12.266
That's nice.
I appreciate that.

378
00:26:12.309 --> 00:26:13.833
I don't think
it's gonna cut it. though.

379
00:26:13.876 --> 00:26:16.313
because it's like 39 short.

380
00:26:16.357 --> 00:26:17.793
Thirty-nine?

381
00:26:17.837 --> 00:26:20.840
No. no. no.
When I went away. it was 20.

382
00:26:20.883 --> 00:26:23.712
You think the juice stopped
when you went inside?

383
00:26:25.148 --> 00:26:26.410
Max. you know. they wanted

384
00:26:26.454 --> 00:26:28.282
to fuck you up
when you were in there.

385
00:26:28.325 --> 00:26:30.458
and I wouldn't let them.
you know why?

386
00:26:30.501 --> 00:26:31.851
You're a fucking
degenerate.

387
00:26:31.894 --> 00:26:33.766
but you're a degenerate
with a heart of gold.

388
00:26:33.809 --> 00:26:35.419
who loves his family

389
00:26:35.463 --> 00:26:36.638
and wouldn't want anything
to happen to them.

390
00:26:36.682 --> 00:26:39.162
Don't even think about
going near my family.

391
00:26:39.206 --> 00:26:41.295
Keep them out of it.

392
00:26:41.338 --> 00:26:43.776
Huh. this buys you one week.

393
00:26:46.692 --> 00:26:48.171
Why don't you let me
earn it?

394
00:26:49.651 --> 00:26:52.785
-In the ring.
-No. those days are gone. Max.

395
00:26:52.828 --> 00:26:55.352
I'm not talking about me.
I got a guy.

396
00:26:55.396 --> 00:26:58.312
-Huh.
-He's good. He's real good.

397
00:26:58.355 --> 00:27:01.010
Now. look. all I need
is one fight to prove it.

398
00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:04.666
Yeah. Uh...

399
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:06.668
-Hey. Carter.
-Yeah. boss?

400
00:27:06.712 --> 00:27:07.713
What do you say?

401
00:27:09.453 --> 00:27:10.759
What's that?

402
00:27:10.803 --> 00:27:12.631
Should we give
our old friend here a break?

403
00:27:14.545 --> 00:27:17.200
I say you let me beat his ass.
throw him in the fucking river.

404
00:27:18.854 --> 00:27:20.769
Yes. The guy's hardcore.

405
00:27:20.813 --> 00:27:22.728
Come on. Look. just--

406
00:27:22.771 --> 00:27:25.469
I don't know. Give me 3-to-1.

407
00:27:25.513 --> 00:27:27.820
My guy against
any one of your guys.

408
00:27:27.863 --> 00:27:30.474
You sure you wanna take
that kind of bet against me?

409
00:27:31.606 --> 00:27:32.738
What have I got to lose?

410
00:27:35.392 --> 00:27:37.699
You could always pick
fighters. Max.

411
00:27:37.743 --> 00:27:39.875
Thank you.
Can't bet sports for shit.

412
00:27:39.919 --> 00:27:42.225
but we wouldn't be here
if you could.

413
00:27:43.792 --> 00:27:46.273
Well. all right.

414
00:27:47.883 --> 00:27:50.364
I'll set you up one fight.
3-to-1.

415
00:27:51.931 --> 00:27:53.628
-That's a bet.
-All right.

416
00:27:55.021 --> 00:27:56.675
Who's this fighter
you're talking about?

417
00:27:57.893 --> 00:27:59.808

His left hook
was better. though.

426

Ha! What you know
about boxing?

427
00:28:57.474 --> 00:28:59.433
He taught me

Oh. he taught you
a little something?

429
00:29:00.651 --> 00:29:01.783
Yeah.

430
00:29:01.827 --> 00:29:03.263
It's good on him
for doing that.

431
00:29:03.306 --> 00:29:04.525

Must have been tough for you.

Hannah. baby.

434
00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:16.363
I need you to empty all the
trash when you come in. please.

435
00:29:16.406 --> 00:29:19.366
-Yes. ma'am.
-Thank you.

436
00:29:24.197 --> 00:29:26.286
-You hungry?
-I'm always hungry.

Good.
Dinner will be ready soon.

438
00:29:29.419 --> 00:29:31.552
Sweet kid you got there.

439
00:29:31.595 --> 00:29:33.293
Yeah. I know.

440
00:29:47.394 --> 00:29:50.658
-Something smells good.
-Thanks.

441
00:29:50.701 --> 00:29:52.660
Oh. I left some fresh towels
out for you.

442
00:29:54.053 --> 00:29:55.054
Okay. Thanks.

Um-hum. You're welcome.

444
00:30:01.016 --> 00:30:02.365
Thank you. really.

445
00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:04.846
For what?

446
00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:07.631
Taking me in.
I feel like a stray.

447
00:30:07.675 --> 00:30:09.851
I always had love
for the strays.

448
00:30:11.679 --> 00:30:14.638
Ever since I was little.
actually.

449
00:30:14.682 --> 00:30:18.338
I remember there was
this cute little puppy

450
00:30:18.381 --> 00:30:20.340
that used to run around
the neighborhood.

451
00:30:20.383 --> 00:30:21.863
And I wanted to keep it
so bad.

452
00:30:21.907 --> 00:30:23.865
but my dad would not
let me have it.

453
00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:26.868
So I hid it and I fed it
for two weeks.

454
00:30:26.912 --> 00:30:28.522
Did he change his mind?

455
00:30:28.565 --> 00:30:30.959
No. He took it to the pound
and had it put to sleep.

456
00:30:31.003 --> 00:30:33.005
-No.
-Said it was
to teach me a lesson.

457
00:30:33.048 --> 00:30:35.355
-Oh. that's rough.
-It was.

458
00:30:35.398 --> 00:30:37.531
-Did it?
-No.

459
00:30:38.706 --> 00:30:40.403
I still got love
for the stray.

460
00:30:57.725 --> 00:30:58.769
Hey.

461
00:30:58.813 --> 00:31:01.729
Well. look who decided
to show up.

462
00:31:01.772 --> 00:31:04.036
I missed it.

463
00:31:04.079 --> 00:31:05.820
-Mm. You did.
-You did.

464
00:31:05.864 --> 00:31:07.082
At the dinner table.

465
00:31:07.126 --> 00:31:08.954
-I'm sorry about that.
-Uh-huh.

466
00:31:08.997 --> 00:31:11.870
Since you've been gone.
Duffy fixed almost ten things.

467
00:31:11.913 --> 00:31:13.001
At least.

468
00:31:13.045 --> 00:31:14.437
You should have seen him.

469
00:31:14.481 --> 00:31:15.786
He was like
Bob the Builder.

470
00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.094
Well. thank you for
helping my Ra.

471
00:31:19.138 --> 00:31:21.488
-Still the same old Max.
-Mm-hm.

472
00:31:21.531 --> 00:31:24.491
Hannah. will you help me
do the dishes. please?

473
00:31:24.534 --> 00:31:25.666
-Please?
-Yeah.

474
00:31:25.709 --> 00:31:27.059
-Thank you.
-Smells good.

475

Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

476

-It was good.
-It was great.

477
00:31:32.455 --> 00:31:34.893
-That's a good family. man.
-Yeah. Yeah.

478
00:31:37.504 --> 00:31:39.071
Where you been?

479
00:31:39.114 --> 00:31:40.637
You wanna know
where I've been?

480
00:31:41.812 --> 00:31:43.771
-Yeah.
-You sure?

481
00:31:43.814 --> 00:31:44.815
Yeah.

482
00:31:46.078 --> 00:31:47.949
I've been setting up
the next things.

483
00:31:47.993 --> 00:31:49.124
-The next thing?
-Uh-huh.

484
00:31:49.168 --> 00:31:51.083
Man. we haven't done
the first thing.

485
00:31:51.126 --> 00:31:53.607
Listen. I talked to my guy.

486
00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:56.044
He says he can get us in
on these next fights.

487
00:31:56.088 --> 00:31:59.047
I'm talking bigger venues.
bigger money.

488
00:32:00.614 --> 00:32:02.137
-Your guy?
-Yeah.

489
00:32:02.181 --> 00:32:04.966
The next fights.
More truck-stop bullshit?

490
00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:06.489
-No. No. Duffy listen.
-I'm not doing it.

491
00:32:06.533 --> 00:32:08.927
Just listen to me for a second.
all right?

492
00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:13.148
It ain't that. We talking about
real fucking money here.

493
00:32:13.192 --> 00:32:14.976
Real money.

494
00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:17.500
And like I told you before.
I know fighters.

495
00:32:17.544 --> 00:32:21.113
These bums. they're not even
in your league. man.

496
00:32:21.156 --> 00:32:22.897
We can take this shit.

497
00:32:24.029 --> 00:32:25.030
We?

00:32:26.031 --> 00:32:27.728
Yeah. we. You know.

499
00:32:27.771 --> 00:32:28.903
it's a team effort.

500
00:32:30.252 --> 00:32:31.688
Yeah. man. it makes sense.

501
00:32:31.732 --> 00:32:33.821
I get punched in the face.

522
00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:15.575
I think we said 3-to-1.
right. Max?

523
00:34:15.618 --> 00:34:16.619
Yeah.

524
00:34:17.272 --> 00:34:18.708
Let's say 5-to-1.

525
00:34:20.232 --> 00:34:23.104
Oh. well.
the agreement was three.

526
00:34:23.148 --> 00:34:25.585
Well. it's 5-to-1
or I'm gonna walk.

527
00:34:25.628 --> 00:34:27.804
This guy...
He's got balls. huh?

528
00:34:27.848 --> 00:34:29.197
He's got skills
to back it.

529
00:34:29.241 --> 00:34:31.808
Skills too? You got skills
to pay the bills?

530
00:34:33.158 --> 00:34:35.160
Why don't you place the bet
and find out?

531
00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:38.641
5-to-1?

532
00:34:40.817 --> 00:34:41.818
I'm down with it.

533
00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:47.781
Let's go.

534
00:34:51.132 --> 00:34:53.613
Yeah. yeah. okay.

535
00:34:53.656 --> 00:34:55.310
All right. all right.
all right. Yeah.

536
00:34:55.354 --> 00:34:57.791
We got new faces
for you here tonight.

537
00:34:57.834 --> 00:34:59.793
No. no. no.
Trust me on this one.

538
00:34:59.836 --> 00:35:01.360
I've seen both of these two.

539
00:35:01.403 --> 00:35:03.318
and they're
the real fucking contenders.

540
00:35:03.362 --> 00:35:05.842
You're in for
a fucking treat. Seriously.

541
00:35:05.886 --> 00:35:08.193
So you know the rules.

542
00:35:08.236 --> 00:35:09.933
You fight
until one of you drops.

543
00:35:09.977 --> 00:35:11.283
There are no fucking tap-outs.

544
00:35:11.326 --> 00:35:12.806
We got that?

545
00:35:12.849 --> 00:35:15.156
Got it? Got it?

546
00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:16.853
Let's fucking fight!

547
00:35:21.728 --> 00:35:23.904

Understood.

But just give me
another chance.

00:36:24.269 --> 00:36:27.185
-A chance for what?
-To win my money back.

563
00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:30.405

He ain't no fucking cowboy.

What odds?

568
00:36:41.808 --> 00:36:43.070
Hey. Duffy.
listen to me.

569
00:36:43.113 --> 00:36:44.376
You don't have
to do this shit. man.

570
00:36:44.419 --> 00:36:46.421
-Double or nothing.
-Triple.

571
00:36:49.294 --> 00:36:50.773
It's triple or nothing.

You got me feeling

00:37:00.305 --> 00:37:02.002
-You good?
-Yeah.

You got a deal.

00:39:26.407 --> 00:39:27.582
I gotta tell you. Duffy.

591
00:39:27.626 --> 00:39:29.410
you are one
bad motherfucker. man.

592
00:39:29.454 --> 00:39:31.586
but let me tell you something.
This is what I noticed.

593
00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:33.371
You're a little flat-footed when
you're throwing your punches.

594
00:39:33.414 --> 00:39:34.633
You know what I'm saying?

595
00:39:34.676 --> 00:39:36.156
You need to get on
the balls of them feet.

596
00:39:36.199 --> 00:39:37.592
generate more power that way.

597
00:39:37.636 --> 00:39:39.420
-Is that right?
-I'm telling you.

598
00:39:39.464 --> 00:39:40.508
Here you go.

599
00:39:42.118 --> 00:39:43.946
-Lion's share.
-Wow.

600
00:39:52.302 --> 00:39:55.305
Let me ask you something.
and this is real talk here.

601
00:39:57.395 --> 00:39:58.526
Why are you in L.A.?

602
00:40:00.659 --> 00:40:02.530
-Why am I in L.A.?
-Yeah.

603
00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:10.146
It's a family thing.

604
00:40:13.672 --> 00:40:15.325
My mother. she...

605
00:40:16.631 --> 00:40:18.633
She died suddenly
a couple years back.

606
00:40:18.677 --> 00:40:19.678
Oh.

607
00:40:20.505 --> 00:40:21.984
I wasn't here.

608
00:40:22.028 --> 00:40:23.464
Nobody was here for her.

609
00:40:23.508 --> 00:40:24.900
Sorry to hear that.

610
00:40:26.511 --> 00:40:28.643
So they put her
in some hole somewhere.

611
00:40:29.688 --> 00:40:30.689
Alone.

612
00:40:32.995 --> 00:40:36.608
Anyway. I'm gonna get her
a headstone.

613
00:40:36.651 --> 00:40:41.003
I'm gonna get a piece of land
and she's gonna rest in peace.

614
00:40:42.483 --> 00:40:43.441
That's why I'm in L.A.

615
00:40:45.399 --> 00:40:47.619
Sounds like you're doing
the right thing by her.

616
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:54.060
Underneath it all.
you're a good dude. Duffy.

617
00:40:55.148 --> 00:40:57.019
Maybe that's why you met me.

618
00:40:58.194 --> 00:40:59.457
-Maybe.
-Maybe.

619
00:41:00.545 --> 00:41:01.633
Get some rest. man.

620
00:41:22.392 --> 00:41:23.568
Hello?

621
00:41:23.611 --> 00:41:26.048
I got the address
to Stan's girl.

622
00:41:29.051 --> 00:41:31.140
-Rachel Bomer?
-Yeah?

623
00:41:31.184 --> 00:41:33.012
We're looking for
Stanley Lazare.

624
00:41:33.055 --> 00:41:34.535
He's not here.

625
00:41:34.579 --> 00:41:36.624
We're gonna have to
search your home.

626
00:41:36.668 --> 00:41:38.670
Not without a warrant.

627
00:41:38.713 --> 00:41:40.236
Fuck. Go.

628
00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:42.151
-Come on.
-What the fuck are you doing?

629
00:41:42.195 --> 00:41:43.457
-Don't touch me.
-Step aside.

630
00:41:43.501 --> 00:41:45.024
What? You can't
just walk in my house.

631
00:41:45.067 --> 00:41:46.460
Don't touch her!
Hannah. come here.

632
00:41:46.504 --> 00:41:47.635
Take a seat. both of you!

633
00:41:47.679 --> 00:41:49.681
Keep going.
Everything. Everything.

634
00:41:56.078 --> 00:41:57.558
Let's go. Tear it apart.

635
00:41:57.602 --> 00:42:00.126
The kid's room. All of it.
Fuck it.

636
00:42:00.169 --> 00:42:01.519
Somebody get out there.

637
00:42:11.441 --> 00:42:13.008
Motherfucking shit.

638
00:42:17.143 --> 00:42:19.145
-Get the kid's room.
-I'll go.

639
00:42:24.019 --> 00:42:25.717
All right. let's go. Let's go!

640
00:42:42.211 --> 00:42:43.386
Keep looking.

641
00:42:55.311 --> 00:42:57.575
What's that?
Check that fucking shit.

642
00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:03.581
The house is clean.

643
00:43:07.802 --> 00:43:08.803
Fuck.

644
00:43:17.159 --> 00:43:18.683
You're a smart woman. Rachel.

645
00:43:20.423 --> 00:43:21.424
And a mom.

646
00:43:22.991 --> 00:43:25.385
You want what's best
for her. right?

647
00:43:25.428 --> 00:43:27.648
Hey. look at me.

648
00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:30.825
Your boyfriend Stan...

649
00:43:33.828 --> 00:43:35.395
he's a piece of shit.

650
00:43:39.312 --> 00:43:41.706
It's in your best interest
to find the money.

651
00:43:46.188 --> 00:43:48.495
God. it's so fucking hard
to be a mother.

652
00:43:50.497 --> 00:43:52.194
There's never enough time.

653
00:44:06.818 --> 00:44:07.819
It's okay. baby.

654
00:44:47.293 --> 00:44:48.250
Take it easy.

655
00:44:50.252 --> 00:44:51.776
Where's my money. Rufus?

656
00:44:51.819 --> 00:44:53.560
I'm just gonna need
a little bit more time. okay?

657
00:44:53.603 --> 00:44:55.910
-Wrong answer.
-Jesus!

658
00:44:58.391 --> 00:45:00.436
Fuck. you're making
a mess. Rufus.

659
00:45:02.438 --> 00:45:05.528
All right! All right!
Take it easy.

660
00:45:05.572 --> 00:45:06.878
All right.

661
00:45:06.921 --> 00:45:08.401
-Let's go! Come on.
-Okay.

662
00:45:08.444 --> 00:45:10.577
Here. Take this.
It's all I got right now.

663
00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:12.797
-What is that?
-I'm gonna have the
rest next week. okay?

664
00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:13.798
-Next week?
-No!

665
00:45:13.841 --> 00:45:15.451
Tomorrow.

666
00:45:15.495 --> 00:45:17.627
Or this is gonna feel
like a fucking massage.

00:45:33.208 --> 00:45:36.559

No shit.

671
00:45:50.617 --> 00:45:52.575
Friends downtown
are concerned.

672
00:45:53.446 --> 00:45:55.013
That's nice.

673
00:45:55.056 --> 00:45:57.363
Their concern doesn't really
fucking help. though. does it?

674
00:45:58.581 --> 00:46:00.583
I'm just the messenger. pal.

675
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.327
Your partner
is out of control.

676
00:46:06.328 --> 00:46:07.852
Her judgment is fucked.

677
00:46:14.989 --> 00:46:17.992
I heard you ran into a little
trouble with one of your CIs.

678
00:46:18.036 --> 00:46:22.736
-You remember Stan Lazare?
-Yeah. That piece of shit.

679
00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:25.347
Word is he's cleaning money
for Sage Parker.

680
00:46:25.391 --> 00:46:26.914
Well. he was.

681
00:46:26.958 --> 00:46:30.309
Until we trusted him to move
some money for an associate.

682
00:46:30.352 --> 00:46:32.790
And then six figures
went missing.

683
00:46:32.833 --> 00:46:33.878
What kind of associate?

684
00:46:35.793 --> 00:46:37.403
Friends from down south.

685
00:46:39.057 --> 00:46:40.536
How much you owe?

686
00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:42.321
Hola. Ridgway.

687
00:46:42.364 --> 00:46:45.411
You've been a tough woman
to track down.

688
00:46:45.454 --> 00:46:47.892
Five hundred K.

689
00:46:47.935 --> 00:46:49.719
We got less than a week
to cover it.

690
00:46:51.547 --> 00:46:54.812
Five hundred?
Friends from the south?

691
00:46:57.684 --> 00:47:01.557
-Got any accounts you can tax?
-Nothing that big. that fast.

692
00:47:01.601 --> 00:47:03.646
Where does Sage come in on this?

693
00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:05.387
It's on him too.

694
00:47:06.606 --> 00:47:08.042
I'm working on
a couple of things

695
00:47:08.086 --> 00:47:09.783
to try to come up
with it.

696
00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:11.959
Okay.

697
00:47:12.003 --> 00:47:14.440
My patience is running out.

698
00:47:14.483 --> 00:47:16.659
-It's handled.
-Good.

699
00:47:16.703 --> 00:47:19.837
I would hate to have
to hear about you on the news.

700
00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:22.404
Like I said. it's handled.

701
00:47:22.448 --> 00:47:25.930
I've got a crew. Six guys.

702
00:47:25.973 --> 00:47:27.888
Straight fucking killers
with badges.

703
00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:30.499
You can trust them.

704
00:47:31.936 --> 00:47:35.896
If the money's right.
we got your back.

705
00:47:38.943 --> 00:47:40.031
Make that happen.

706
00:47:40.901 --> 00:47:42.555
Tick-tock.

707
00:47:42.598 --> 00:47:44.252
Tick-tock.

708
00:47:58.484 --> 00:47:59.877
Oh. fuck.

709
00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:01.487
-You okay?
-You all right?

710
00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:03.576
No. I'm not okay.
Look at this place.

711
00:48:03.619 --> 00:48:04.620
Holy shit.

712
00:48:06.187 --> 00:48:07.797
They came in here.
They destroyed everything.

713
00:48:07.841 --> 00:48:09.756
Why? What'd they say?

714
00:48:09.799 --> 00:48:12.411
-They were looking for Stan.
-Stan?

715
00:48:12.454 --> 00:48:13.716
What is this guy into?

716
00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.457
He owned a dry cleaners.
That's all I know.

717
00:48:15.501 --> 00:48:16.719
That's it?-Yes.

718
00:48:16.763 --> 00:48:17.895
What else did they say?

719
00:48:17.938 --> 00:48:19.809
They said they were
looking for money.

720
00:48:20.767 --> 00:48:22.900
And they asked
about somebody named Sage.

721
00:48:24.205 --> 00:48:25.554
You know somebody named Sage?

722
00:48:25.598 --> 00:48:27.121
Sage.

723
00:48:27.165 --> 00:48:29.863
Max. is he
coming back here?

724
00:48:29.907 --> 00:48:34.172
Is he coming back?
What do I do. Max?

725
00:48:34.215 --> 00:48:35.564
Look. just. um...

726
00:48:35.608 --> 00:48:36.957
You just sit tight.
all right?

727
00:48:37.001 --> 00:48:38.872
Just listen to me.
Listen to me.

728
00:48:38.916 --> 00:48:42.615
Just sit tight. Lock the door.
We'll be right back. okay?

729
00:48:42.658 --> 00:48:44.878
Just lock the door.
I'll call you.

730
00:48:44.922 --> 00:48:46.880
No cops.
Don't let anybody in.

731
00:48:46.924 --> 00:48:47.925
Okay?

732
00:49:23.525 --> 00:49:24.526
Yo!

733
00:49:27.094 --> 00:49:28.095
Where's Sage at?

734
00:49:32.056 --> 00:49:33.057
I wouldn't.

735
00:49:39.106 --> 00:49:40.803
He's in the office. man.

736
00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:45.678
Come on. man.

737
00:49:50.074 --> 00:49:52.772
-Hey. What the fuck?
-What the fuck?

738
00:49:52.815 --> 00:49:55.035
You send the cops to my house
and rough up my family?

739
00:49:55.079 --> 00:49:57.951
-No. I didn't do shit.
-That's bullshit.

740
00:49:57.995 --> 00:50:00.910
They fucked up my house.
They roughed up my sister!

741
00:50:00.954 --> 00:50:02.825
-What are you talking about?
-They threatened her!

742
00:50:02.869 --> 00:50:04.958
No. that ain't me.

743
00:50:05.002 --> 00:50:06.960
But I do know
Stan still owes a lot of money

744
00:50:07.004 --> 00:50:09.180
to people much more
dangerous than I am.

745
00:50:09.223 --> 00:50:12.705
If you wanna mess with them.
go on. go on ahead.

746
00:50:12.748 --> 00:50:14.924
But it went missing
from your sister's house. Max.

747
00:50:14.968 --> 00:50:16.839
If you're not
responsible for it.

748
00:50:16.883 --> 00:50:18.711
who do you think
will be?

749
00:50:18.754 --> 00:50:19.973
Listen to me.

750
00:50:20.017 --> 00:50:22.062
just keep your people
away from my family.

751
00:50:22.106 --> 00:50:26.806
All right. well. I'll call off
the dogs. if you pay the debt.

752
00:50:28.329 --> 00:50:32.203
-And you come fight for me.
-Never gonna happen.

753
00:50:32.246 --> 00:50:34.553
All right. I'll give you
48 hours to decide.

754
00:50:34.596 --> 00:50:38.557
After that. the outcome's
beyond my control. believe me.

755
00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:40.907
Sage. you know what?
Fuck this.

756
00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:42.561
Oh. Max. come on.

757
00:50:42.604 --> 00:50:44.171
We're friends.
I love you. man.

758
00:50:44.215 --> 00:50:46.304
You want another shot
at the title. big man?

759
00:50:46.347 --> 00:50:47.479
You got lucky.

760
00:50:49.611 --> 00:50:51.222
-You got this. baby.
-Yeah.

761
00:51:02.929 --> 00:51:03.930
Hello.

762
00:51:05.018 --> 00:51:06.019
Do I know you?

763
00:51:07.629 --> 00:51:08.630
I know you.

764
00:51:16.247 --> 00:51:17.944
Call me if you want
to level up.

765
00:51:19.163 --> 00:51:20.164
Level up?

766
00:51:22.644 --> 00:51:23.993
What the fuck?

767
00:51:24.603 --> 00:51:26.779
What kind of cops
do you got here?

768
00:51:38.182 --> 00:51:39.792
Goddamn it.

769
00:51:39.835 --> 00:51:41.881
What the fuck
is going on here?

770
00:51:41.924 --> 00:51:44.231
I don't know. man. but
these are bad fucking cops.

771
00:51:45.711 --> 00:51:47.060
Your sister's
in trouble. Max.

772
00:51:49.454 --> 00:51:50.803
Hey. I--

773
00:51:51.195 --> 00:51:52.631
I appreciate
everything.

774
00:51:52.674 --> 00:51:54.023
but you don't have to
do this. all right?

775
00:51:54.067 --> 00:51:55.329
This is my fight.

776
00:51:59.333 --> 00:52:00.595
This is our fight.

777
00:52:03.032 --> 00:52:04.251
It's our fight.

778
00:52:06.210 --> 00:52:07.211
Come on.

779
00:52:37.458 --> 00:52:40.809
-What the fuck you doing here?
-I need a fight. ASAP.

780
00:52:42.246 --> 00:52:44.422
Yeah. well.
you better keep looking.

781
00:52:44.465 --> 00:52:47.686
Fosco. What you got
for me. man?

782
00:52:49.905 --> 00:52:52.778
You're not a good person
to be seen with right now. Max.

783
00:52:52.821 --> 00:52:55.346
Sage will hand me my ass
just for talking to you.

784
00:52:55.389 --> 00:52:56.869
He wants payback.

785
00:52:56.912 --> 00:52:59.350
Yeah. and I'm trying to get
him that payback.

786
00:52:59.393 --> 00:53:01.003
So what is he.
all of a sudden

787
00:53:01.047 --> 00:53:03.223
hurting to put fists
in the ring?

788
00:53:03.267 --> 00:53:04.224
Come on. man.

789
00:53:04.268 --> 00:53:05.356
Between you and I.

790
00:53:05.399 --> 00:53:07.836
we both know
he's not the only one

791
00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:09.360
putting on fights
in this town.

792
00:53:12.754 --> 00:53:13.929
What about that lady?

793
00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:18.107
You really wanna go there?

794
00:53:21.415 --> 00:53:22.416
Okay.

795
00:53:23.374 --> 00:53:24.853
I'll see what I can do.

796
00:53:27.421 --> 00:53:30.337
-I owe you one.
-I'll remember you said that.

797
00:53:50.096 --> 00:53:51.358
Hey. look at me. Look at me.

798
00:53:52.794 --> 00:53:54.753
Can you breathe?
Can you breathe?

799
00:53:54.796 --> 00:53:56.972
Put this in the wound.
Put this in the wound.

800
00:53:58.496 --> 00:54:00.802
Breathe.

801
00:54:00.846 --> 00:54:02.413
You're gonna walk out of here.

802
00:54:02.456 --> 00:54:04.328
Look at me.
You're gonna walk out of here.

803
00:54:04.371 --> 00:54:06.808
Duffy. keep the pressure on him.
I'll lift him forward.

804
00:54:06.852 --> 00:54:08.767
It's gonna fucking hurt.
Are you ready?

805
00:54:08.810 --> 00:54:11.900
-Three. two. one. go.
-Fuck!

806
00:54:11.944 --> 00:54:13.424
Okay. Okay.

807
00:54:13.467 --> 00:54:16.165
-I want you to stay calm. Relax.
-All right. All right.

808
00:54:16.209 --> 00:54:18.298
-It's nothing.
-We're gonna go out of here.

809
00:54:18.342 --> 00:54:19.473
Huh.

810
00:54:20.822 --> 00:54:22.128
We're gonna take him
out of here.

811
00:54:22.171 --> 00:54:24.870
Yeah. We're gonna get you
out of here.

812
00:54:24.913 --> 00:54:26.306
Yeah.

813
00:54:26.350 --> 00:54:27.351
Ford?

814
00:54:29.353 --> 00:54:30.484
We got you. buddy.

815
00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:34.967
-We got you. old boy.
-Hey. hey.

816
00:54:36.969 --> 00:54:37.970
Shit.

817
00:54:39.363 --> 00:54:42.191
-We gotta go. We gotta go.
-Goddamn it.

818
00:54:42.235 --> 00:54:44.368
We gotta get him
back to his family. Duff.

819
00:54:44.411 --> 00:54:46.935
We gotta get him back
to his fucking family. okay?

820
00:54:48.981 --> 00:54:51.984
Come on. Come on.
Up!

821
00:55:30.239 --> 00:55:31.240
Hey.

822
00:55:34.505 --> 00:55:36.115
Can't sleep either. huh?

823
00:55:36.158 --> 00:55:39.074
-No. Did I wake you?
-No. No.

824
00:55:40.075 --> 00:55:42.034
I'm up all night.

825
00:55:42.077 --> 00:55:45.037
That Hannah. that girl can
sleep through an earthquake.

826
00:55:46.299 --> 00:55:48.040
-You're fine.
-Okay. good.

827
00:55:52.174 --> 00:55:55.352
Thank you. For everything.

828
00:55:56.265 --> 00:55:57.919
Fixing the house.

829
00:55:59.094 --> 00:56:00.226
I appreciate you.

830
00:56:01.488 --> 00:56:02.489
You're welcome.

831
00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:08.103
So tell me about you.

832
00:56:09.583 --> 00:56:11.455
What was it like
being in the military?

833
00:56:13.587 --> 00:56:15.284
It was all right at first.

834
00:56:16.590 --> 00:56:18.331
I was really young
when I joined.

835
00:56:18.375 --> 00:56:20.202
I was gonna
change the world.

836
00:56:20.246 --> 00:56:21.421
Really?

837
00:56:21.465 --> 00:56:23.902
Yeah.
Till the world changed me.

838
00:56:25.469 --> 00:56:26.470
How so?

839
00:56:27.471 --> 00:56:29.603
Well. I mean.

840
00:56:29.647 --> 00:56:31.562
I saw some bad things.
you know.

841
00:56:31.605 --> 00:56:34.913
You don't see the worst
parts of humanity

842
00:56:34.956 --> 00:56:36.523
over and over and over again

843
00:56:36.567 --> 00:56:39.178
and not be affected.
not be screwed up.

844
00:56:42.486 --> 00:56:43.487
I'm sorry.

845
00:56:44.531 --> 00:56:45.967
Yeah.

846
00:56:46.011 --> 00:56:47.534
I lost
a lot of good friends.

847
00:56:47.578 --> 00:56:49.971
A lot of good brothers.

848
00:56:51.582 --> 00:56:54.149
I see their faces every night
when I close my eyes.

849
00:56:54.193 --> 00:56:56.891
Every. every single night.

850
00:56:59.372 --> 00:57:00.460
I can't escape it.

851
00:57:02.375 --> 00:57:03.942
That's why I keep moving.

852
00:57:06.727 --> 00:57:07.902
So...

853
00:57:09.513 --> 00:57:10.992
That's my sad story.

854
00:57:18.522 --> 00:57:19.610
It's not that sad.

855
00:57:35.452 --> 00:57:36.453
Come on.

856
00:57:39.456 --> 00:57:41.022
What can I do for you. Fosco?

857
00:57:42.371 --> 00:57:45.331
The question is.
what can I do for you?

858
00:57:45.374 --> 00:57:48.029
Well.
I'm seriously intrigued.

859
00:57:49.204 --> 00:57:50.641
-Duffy.
-What about him?

860
00:57:54.209 --> 00:57:55.776
You want to know
the shit about him?

861
00:57:55.820 --> 00:57:57.125
Well. uh--

862
00:57:57.169 --> 00:57:58.300
Word on the street is...

863
00:57:59.650 --> 00:58:01.521
he's put a major dent
in your payroll

864
00:58:01.565 --> 00:58:04.089
and he's made you look
like a fool.

865
00:58:09.181 --> 00:58:11.226
You think I look like
a fool. Fosco?

866
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:13.446
Well. would I be here
if I did?

867
00:58:14.578 --> 00:58:15.666
Right.

868
00:58:15.709 --> 00:58:18.495
Max is desperate
for another fight.

869
00:58:18.538 --> 00:58:20.018
He wants high stakes.

870
00:58:24.718 --> 00:58:27.547
Fine. Fuck it.
Let's give him what he wants.

871
00:58:27.591 --> 00:58:29.897
See if he can fight
with the big dogs.

974
01:05:09.209 --> 01:05:10.645
And he just forgot
that it was there

975
01:05:10.689 --> 01:05:12.430

-I was just trying to help.
-I know. I know. It's okay.

982
01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:28.750
I'm sorry.

983
01:05:28.794 --> 01:05:31.101
I didn't mean for those cops
to mess up the house.

984
01:05:31.144 --> 01:05:32.276
Baby. look at me.
Look. wait.

985

01:11:16.489 --> 01:11:18.317
I tried to get
in contact with you.

1048
01:11:19.318 --> 01:11:20.101
You did?

1049
01:11:20.145 --> 01:11:21.320
Yeah. I did.

1050
01:11:21.364 --> 01:11:23.322
Yeah. I went through a thing.
you know.

1051
01:11:25.106 --> 01:11:26.934
Yeah. Nah.

1052
01:11:27.892 --> 01:11:29.328
It's all right. mate.

1053
01:11:31.504 --> 01:11:33.245
Thank you.

1054
01:11:33.289 --> 01:11:36.335
Did he fill you in on. uh.
all this guy's accomplishments

1055
01:11:36.379 --> 01:11:38.511
and the legend that is
Duffy?

1056
01:11:38.555 --> 01:11:40.513
-Not a clue.
-Fucking legend.

1057
01:11:40.557 --> 01:11:42.472
Saved my ass at
least twice. Right?

1058
01:11:42.515 --> 01:11:44.038
-Probably more.
-Probably.

1059
01:11:44.082 --> 01:11:47.041
Yeah.
One time in Kenya.

1060
01:11:47.085 --> 01:11:50.001
Yeah. you remember that?
And then. uh...

1061
01:11:50.044 --> 01:11:51.307
Mogadishu.

1062
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:53.352
Moga-fucking-dishu. Yeah.

1063
01:11:53.396 --> 01:11:56.964
Lucky to get out of that place
in one piece.

1064
01:11:57.008 --> 01:11:58.009
Maybe.

1065
01:12:01.055 --> 01:12:05.582
So. uh. ahem. you wanna tell me
what's going down?

1066
01:12:05.625 --> 01:12:07.148
Going through the shit. man.

1067
01:12:08.541 --> 01:12:11.022
His sister is--
His niece is in trouble.

1068
01:12:11.065 --> 01:12:15.505
We're dealing with
some crooked fucking cops.

1069
01:12:15.548 --> 01:12:18.377
-The worst kind.
-It's bad.

1070
01:12:18.421 --> 01:12:21.554
We need guns. We need gear.
We need it tonight.

1071
01:12:22.903 --> 01:12:23.904
Well. uh...

1072
01:12:25.950 --> 01:12:27.865
there's something in the car.

1073
01:12:27.908 --> 01:12:29.127
In the car. heh?

1074
01:12:29.170 --> 01:12:30.563
Yeah. I got something
in the car.

1075
01:12:33.131 --> 01:12:34.480
I wasn't sure exactly
what you needed.

1076
01:12:34.524 --> 01:12:36.308
so I brought a few options.

1077
01:12:36.352 --> 01:12:39.050
-Yeah. you did.
-We appreciate this.

1078
01:12:39.093 --> 01:12:42.488
Hey. don't worry.
For this guy. whatever you need.

1079
01:12:42.532 --> 01:12:44.229
-Fuck.
-I owe you. brother.

1080
01:12:44.272 --> 01:12:45.535
You don't owe me. mate.

1081
01:12:47.928 --> 01:12:49.626
-So when do we leave?
-We?

1082
01:12:51.323 --> 01:12:53.238
You got nothing
to do with this. man.

1083
01:12:53.281 --> 01:12:54.326
I fucking do now.

1084
01:12:55.458 --> 01:12:56.546
This isn't your fight brother.

1085
01:12:56.589 --> 01:12:58.374
Since when was
any of the shit

1086
01:12:58.417 --> 01:13:00.071
that we did over there
our fight?

1087
01:13:00.114 --> 01:13:01.942
It was never
our fucking fight. was it?

1088
01:13:02.987 --> 01:13:04.467
Right now. I got a mate

1089
01:13:04.510 --> 01:13:06.120
who needs my fucking help.

1090
01:13:06.164 --> 01:13:08.471
So whether you like it or not.
I'm coming with you.

1091
01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:13.911
Besides. I'm bored
out of my fucking mind.

1092
01:13:38.196 --> 01:13:39.676
They're here.

1093
01:13:39.719 --> 01:13:41.417
Green means go.

1094
01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:43.941
My lead. through the front.
Riggs. through the back.

1095
01:13:43.984 --> 01:13:45.246
Remember.
no arrests tonight.

1096
01:13:45.290 --> 01:13:47.640
no paperwork.
Toe tags for everyone.

1097
01:13:53.733 --> 01:13:55.692
-Hey! Hey!
-Where is he? Where is he?

1098
01:13:57.084 --> 01:13:58.956
-Where is he? Where is he?
-Fuck you.

1099
01:13:58.999 --> 01:14:02.176
-Where is he?
-Where's Sage? Sage!

1100
01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:03.569
We had a fucking deal. I fight.

1101
01:14:03.613 --> 01:14:05.310
you leave his family alone.

1102
01:14:05.353 --> 01:14:07.007
And I did. What the fuck
you talking about?

1103
01:14:07.051 --> 01:14:08.052
The drive-by.

1104
01:14:09.357 --> 01:14:11.621
The drive-by at my house.
you fucking asshole.

1105
01:14:11.664 --> 01:14:13.405
-They shot my niece!
-I didn't do--

1106
01:14:13.449 --> 01:14:15.451
What you think this
shit is funny. huh?

1107
01:14:23.589 --> 01:14:24.982
It's Ridgway.

1108
01:14:25.678 --> 01:14:27.332
-Fuck her.
-Where is she?

1109
01:14:27.854 --> 01:14:29.073
Where is she?

1110
01:14:29.116 --> 01:14:31.292
-Ridgway's a cop.
-I don't give a fuck.

1111
01:14:31.336 --> 01:14:33.730
Santiago was a cop.
She's cleaning up loose ends.

1112
01:14:33.773 --> 01:14:35.122
We're all fucked.

1113
01:16:39.159 --> 01:16:40.204
Light them up!

1114
01:16:57.743 --> 01:16:58.788
Max?

1115
01:17:13.193 --> 01:17:14.368
Baby!

1116
01:17:20.374 --> 01:17:22.507
-Are you okay?
-I love you. Lynx.

1117
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:24.204
Baby. are you okay?

1118
01:17:34.388 --> 01:17:35.868
I didn't do shit.

1119
01:17:37.565 --> 01:17:38.697
I know you didn't do shit.

1120
01:17:43.006 --> 01:17:44.007
Max!

1121
01:17:45.835 --> 01:17:46.836
You good?

1122
01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:49.708
-Max!
-Drop the fucking gun

1123
01:17:49.752 --> 01:17:51.318
or I'll shoot him
in the head.

1124
01:17:51.362 --> 01:17:53.886
-Fuck.
-Drop the fucking gun!

1125
01:17:53.930 --> 01:17:55.409
All right. all right.

1126
01:17:56.497 --> 01:17:57.673
All right.

1127
01:18:04.418 --> 01:18:05.898
How are you gonna
get out of this?

1128
01:18:09.293 --> 01:18:10.424
It's what I do. Duffy.

1129
01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:16.343
It's too bad Sage fucked up.

1130
01:18:17.954 --> 01:18:19.869
We could have had some fun.

1131
01:18:19.912 --> 01:18:20.913
Fuck off.

1132
01:18:35.449 --> 01:18:37.625
-You good?
-Yeah. yeah.

1133
01:18:38.844 --> 01:18:40.846
Ugh... Fuck!

1134
01:18:42.456 --> 01:18:43.457
Am I dying?

1135
01:18:55.382 --> 01:18:56.383
I can't...

1136
01:19:07.394 --> 01:19:08.744
-Come on.
-All right. Yeah.

1137
01:19:11.921 --> 01:19:13.574
-Let me see.
-Fuck.

1138
01:19:15.838 --> 01:19:18.928
The goddamn thing
actually works. Huh!

1139
01:19:21.408 --> 01:19:22.409
Oh. fuck.

1140
01:19:25.673 --> 01:19:27.850
You're all right.
You are all right. man.

1141
01:19:27.893 --> 01:19:29.808
Sorry. brother.

1142
01:19:29.852 --> 01:19:31.636
I'm sorry. brother.

1143
01:19:31.679 --> 01:19:33.203
You got nothing to be
sorry about.

1144
01:19:34.987 --> 01:19:37.468
All right. All right.

1145
01:19:37.511 --> 01:19:40.645
All right. Look at me.
Walk you out of here.

1146
01:19:40.688 --> 01:19:41.777
-Duff?
-Yeah.

1147
01:19:47.608 --> 01:19:49.610
I'm gonna walk you out of here.

1148
01:19:49.654 --> 01:19:51.656
I'll walk you out of here.

1149
01:19:51.699 --> 01:19:52.788
-Duff?
-Yeah.

1150
01:19:57.009 --> 01:19:58.271
I missed you. man.

1151
01:20:00.883 --> 01:20:01.971
I missed you.

1152
01:20:03.886 --> 01:20:04.930
I missed you too.

1153
01:20:24.732 --> 01:20:26.082
Hey. I'm sorry. man.

1154
01:20:27.387 --> 01:20:28.519
You okay?

1155
01:20:28.562 --> 01:20:31.609
-Yeah. Yeah. I'm good.
-Okay. good.

1156
01:20:33.002 --> 01:20:36.005
Hey. Duff. come on. man.
We gotta go.

1157
01:20:36.048 --> 01:20:37.528
Go. man. You go.
Get out of here.

1158
01:20:37.571 --> 01:20:38.703
No.

1159
01:20:39.922 --> 01:20:42.054
Listen to me.
We go together.

1160
01:20:43.577 --> 01:20:45.405
That's it.
Together.

1161
01:20:51.063 --> 01:20:52.717
Okay.

1162
01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:53.761
All right.

1163
01:21:09.038 --> 01:21:10.387
Morning. John.

1164
01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:11.823
We are live
here in downtown.

1165
01:21:11.867 --> 01:21:13.694
where last night
police are saying

1166
01:21:13.738 --> 01:21:15.392
a massive shootout took place

1167
01:21:15.435 --> 01:21:18.569
between local law enforcement
and drug traffickers.

1168
01:21:18.612 --> 01:21:20.397
At least ten are dead.

1169
01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:23.879
including veteran detectives
Ray Kincaid and Ellen Ridgway.

1170
01:21:23.922 --> 01:21:26.055
who tragically lost their lives
in the line of duty.

1171
01:21:26.098 --> 01:21:28.753
Ridgway was
a highly decorated officer.

1172
01:21:28.796 --> 01:21:30.581
who.
according to the department.

1173
01:21:30.624 --> 01:21:32.931
served her district
with passion and honor.

1174
01:21:32.975 --> 01:21:34.672
And her loss will leave a void

1175
01:21:34.715 --> 01:21:37.022
in the community she served
for years to come.

1176
01:22:57.146 --> 01:22:59.104
Hey Rachel. it's Duff.

1177
01:22:59.713 --> 01:23:01.715
Look. I just wanted to
say thank you.

1178
01:23:02.586 --> 01:23:04.588
Looking out for me. you know.
taking in a stranger.

1179
01:23:04.631 --> 01:23:05.850
I appreciate it.

1180
01:23:08.113 --> 01:23:10.681
Sorry I won't be there for
Hannah when she wakes up but...

1181
01:23:13.205 --> 01:23:15.599
She is strong. like her momma.

1182
01:23:16.643 --> 01:23:17.949
She'll be fine.

1183
01:23:21.126 --> 01:23:22.954
Anyway. I got to take
off for a while.

1184
01:23:22.998 --> 01:23:24.477
Till this whole thing dies down.

1185
01:23:24.521 --> 01:23:26.871
You know cops.
they look out for cops.

1186
01:23:27.524 --> 01:23:28.742
Good or bad.

1187
01:23:32.050 --> 01:23:33.356
As for the money...

1188
01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:38.187
I took what I needed for a
proper headstone for my mom.

1189
01:23:39.492 --> 01:23:41.668
Somewhere. I know she's
gonna be happy.

1190
01:23:44.976 --> 01:23:46.412
Keep the rest for you guys.

1191
01:23:50.025 --> 01:23:51.635
Keep Max out of trouble.

1192
01:23:54.116 --> 01:23:55.508
He's a good man.

1193
01:23:56.857 --> 01:23:58.772
Keep that spare room ready.
okay?

1194
01:23:59.121 --> 01:24:01.558
You never know when I might
pop in to see you guys.

1195
01:24:02.646 --> 01:24:04.082
I'll see you again.

1196
01:24:05.214 --> 01:24:06.389
