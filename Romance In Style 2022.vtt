Woman:
Of course.

16
00:00:51.767 --> 00:00:53.233
Good morning. Ella.

17
00:00:53.367 --> 00:00:54.500
You're like Horowitz
with a needle and thread.

18
00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:56.300
Hi. Max.

19
00:00:56.433 --> 00:00:57.600
You mean the piano player?

20
00:00:57.734 --> 00:00:59.000
Best there ever was.

21
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:01.400
Fashion Week is
only five weeks away

22
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:04.734
and we've still got gaps
in our collection.

23
00:01:04.867 --> 00:01:06.166
What about the trench-dress
and the metallic blazer?

24
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.967
Done and nearly done.

25
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:11.300
Who did this?

26
00:01:13.667 --> 00:01:16.033
Um... I did.

27
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:17.200
Who are you?

28
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:18.834
Ella Richards. I'm a sewer.

29
00:01:20.967 --> 00:01:22.867
The placket wasn't working.
so I split the pleat

30
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.233
on either side of the closure.

31
00:01:25.367 --> 00:01:27.000
I like it.

32
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:28.233
You do.

33
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:31.033
Who are you wearing?

34
00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:33.033
I'm wearing me.

35
00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:34.533
You're a designer?

36
00:01:34.667 --> 00:01:35.867
A really good one.

37
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.967
Yes. I can see that.

38
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.333
That means a lot
coming from you.

39
00:01:41.467 --> 00:01:43.333
Max: I met Ella on the job.

40
00:01:43.467 --> 00:01:45.633
I went to her loft and saw
her work and I was knocked out.

41
00:01:45.767 --> 00:01:49.066
Hm. Max gave me
the same stamp of approval

42
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.166
when I was starting out.

43
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.200
He was certainly
right about you.

44
00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:55.800
I've never known him
to be wrong.

45
00:01:55.934 --> 00:01:59.333
If Max says you're good.
believe him.

♪ Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh ♪

47
00:02:04.834 --> 00:02:06.233
Meeting Annie Chew
was so inspiring.

48
00:02:06.367 --> 00:02:07.633
all I want to do is work.

49
00:02:07.767 --> 00:02:09.367
That's all you ever do anyway.

50
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.300
I really needed
a boost right now.

51
00:02:11.433 --> 00:02:13.633
Every time I talk to
my mom or my brother.

52
00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:17.734
I try to convince them that my
designer dream is going strong.

53
00:02:17.867 --> 00:02:20.133
and they always
pretend to believe me.

54
00:02:20.266 --> 00:02:21.934
Before you tumble down
the rabbit hole of doubt.

55
00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:23.967
you want some left-over Chinese?

56
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.133
Maybe later.

57
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.367
Oh. how much Candice Huffine
can one wall take?

58
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.700
Well. I need all
the inspiration I can get.

59
00:02:32.834 --> 00:02:34.467
Is your schedule free
for the next few days?

60
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.300
I'm waiting to hear about a new
sewing gig. but it might be.

61
00:02:39.433 --> 00:02:41.100
There's a really big
photo shoot coming up at work

62
00:02:41.233 --> 00:02:43.934
and I could use an extra set
of hands in the fitting room.

63
00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:45.633
Claudia is pulling out
all the stops

64
00:02:45.767 --> 00:02:47.200
and driving everybody nuts.

65
00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:48.734
Yeah. well.
she's a perfectionist.

66
00:02:48.867 --> 00:02:49.967
Most legends are.

67
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.633
If by "perfectionist" you mean

68
00:02:51.767 --> 00:02:53.467
treating everybody at
the magazine with the same

69
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.967
disdain as gum stuck to
the sole of her Louboutin pumps.

70
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.934
You certainly have
a way with words.

71
00:02:59.066 --> 00:03:00.800
If only I could get
someone to read them.

72
00:03:00.934 --> 00:03:02.934
I'm working on this piece
about the elegant chaos

73
00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:04.667
of Fashion Week.

74
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.433
"Celebrities line the runway
as designers have heart attacks

75
00:03:07.567 --> 00:03:09.367
back stage when
a model misses a cue."

76
00:03:12.166 --> 00:03:13.467
So. are those nimble
fingers available?

77
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.133
You'd be doing me
a really big favour.

78
00:03:15.266 --> 00:03:16.500
Okay. I'm in.

79
00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:22.033
I mean.
I don't know about you.

80
00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:23.467
but I had a great
time last night.

81
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.967
Yeah. who knew
you could cook like that?

82
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.300
That's almond milk. right?

83
00:03:27.433 --> 00:03:29.100
I thought you said soy.

84
00:03:29.233 --> 00:03:32.100
You know. hold on one second.
I'm getting another call.

85
00:03:32.233 --> 00:03:34.367
Hey. when did you
get back into town?

86
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.133
I did. I tried calling you.

87
00:03:36.266 --> 00:03:37.667
You need to
tell her what you want.

88
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.967
I'm just--
Hold on one second.

89
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.967
Uh... I'm sorry.
what did you say?

90
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.867
- She's waiting.
- Who's waiting?

91
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.934
She is.

92
00:03:46.066 --> 00:03:47.600
All of us are.

93
00:03:47.734 --> 00:03:50.000
Oh. right. Sorry.

94
00:03:50.133 --> 00:03:52.100
Um... Almond milk. please.

95
00:03:52.233 --> 00:03:53.867
Coming right up.

96
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.266
Yeah. Yeah. no. You know what?
Saturday night works for me.

97
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.767
Unbelievable.

98
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.266
Okay. I'm--
I'm going to call you back.

99
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.367
Is something wrong?

100
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.000
Oh. no. It's just
that some of us have

101
00:04:09.133 --> 00:04:10.767
places to be. that's all.

102
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.700
Right. Well. some of us would
like to get what we ordered.

103
00:04:13.834 --> 00:04:15.066
Whatever.

104
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.066
Wow.

105
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.900
What?

106
00:04:18.033 --> 00:04:20.400
I've just never heard three
syllables sound so judgmental.

107
00:04:20.533 --> 00:04:21.700
Well--

108
00:04:21.834 --> 00:04:23.333
That's for you.

109
00:04:23.467 --> 00:04:26.934
Have a wonderful day.
Have a wonderful day.

110
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.333
Okay. well.
call me tomorrow.

111
00:04:32.467 --> 00:04:33.533
Sounds good. Bye.

112
00:04:35.667 --> 00:04:38.667
I'm sorry. Are you--
Are you following me?

113
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.433
I was about to ask
you the same thing.

114
00:04:40.567 --> 00:04:41.567
So. that's a no?

115
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.000
Don't flatter yourself.

116
00:04:43.133 --> 00:04:44.667
So. are you
always this friendly?

117
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.567
Only with strangers
I can't seem to shake.

118
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.066
I'm not a stranger.

119
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.734
You're the guy who
doesn't like soy milk.

120
00:04:49.867 --> 00:04:50.734
Seriously?

121
00:04:50.867 --> 00:04:51.834
I guess so.

122
00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.500
Let me guess. You're heading
to the tenth floor.

123
00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:02.233
Yeah. As a matter of fact. I am.

124
00:05:02.367 --> 00:05:03.934
You work at the magazine?

125
00:05:04.066 --> 00:05:05.834
I just started. How about you?

126
00:05:05.967 --> 00:05:09.233
My roommate does. I'm just
helping out for a few days.

127
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.266
I guess this is us.

128
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.367
There is no us.

129
00:05:18.066 --> 00:05:19.667
Do you think this was fate?

130
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.667
Whatever it was. I'm afraid
it's over. I'm late.

131
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.667
Well. it was fun
while it lasted.

132
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.834
You said that you were new here?

133
00:05:24.967 --> 00:05:26.066
I am. First day.

134
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.767
I'm a little nervous.

135
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.633
Word to the wise. stay out
of Claudia Davenport's way.

136
00:05:29.767 --> 00:05:31.400
I hear she can be
a real tyrant.

137
00:05:31.533 --> 00:05:32.934
- Noted.
- Good luck.

138
00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:34.500
Thank you.

139
00:05:36.567 --> 00:05:38.967
Claudia booked
Umberto DeLuca to do the shoot

140
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.734
and she's gone from
overbearing to full-on diva.

141
00:05:41.867 --> 00:05:43.567
When I think of
the fashion icons

142
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.934
that have walked these halls.

143
00:05:45.066 --> 00:05:46.767
Right?
Speaking of icons.

144
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.934
keep your eyes forward
and your mouth shut.

145
00:05:49.066 --> 00:05:51.300
Ella: Oh. wow. Look at that suit
she is wearing.

146
00:05:51.433 --> 00:05:53.600
The woman does not disappoint.

147
00:05:53.734 --> 00:05:56.400
There's Liza.
my impossible boss.

148
00:05:56.533 --> 00:05:57.900
You never said
how pretty she is.

149
00:05:58.033 --> 00:05:59.967
If you can get
past her personality.

150
00:06:00.166 --> 00:06:01.700
Why aren't you
in The Closet?

151
00:06:01.834 --> 00:06:03.233
I was headed there now.

152
00:06:03.367 --> 00:06:05.233
Start pulling some of
the looks that we discussed.

153
00:06:13.266 --> 00:06:14.967
I feel like Dorothy entering Oz.

154
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.233
Start clicking your heels
because here we go.

155
00:06:17.367 --> 00:06:19.834
Gucci. I mean.

156
00:06:21.433 --> 00:06:23.900
It's like I died
and went to designer heaven.

157
00:06:24.033 --> 00:06:26.467
On your 87th visit
the magic wears a little thin.

158
00:06:28.433 --> 00:06:30.800
Armani?

159
00:06:30.934 --> 00:06:32.500
It's gorgeous.

160
00:06:32.633 --> 00:06:34.066
- Can I try it on?
- No.

161
00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.734
- Come on. Please?
- No.

162
00:06:44.967 --> 00:06:46.266
How you doing?

163
00:06:51.767 --> 00:06:54.533
Our subs are down.
We're losing advertisers.

164
00:06:54.667 --> 00:06:57.400
Hey. I get I.

165
00:06:57.533 --> 00:06:58.734
These are hard times
for all print media.

166
00:06:58.867 --> 00:07:01.633
As the newly-installed
man in charge.

167
00:07:01.767 --> 00:07:03.233
what do you propose we do?

168
00:07:03.367 --> 00:07:05.400
Well. I hate to say it. Claudia.

169
00:07:05.533 --> 00:07:08.033
but the magazine. it's--
it's outdated.

170
00:07:08.166 --> 00:07:10.700
The remaining subscribers. they
don't relate to the content.

171
00:07:10.834 --> 00:07:12.767
I'm not saying it's your fault.

172
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.433
It's just the way it is.

173
00:07:14.567 --> 00:07:15.867
Your father is here.

174
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.533
Perfect. send him in.

175
00:07:17.667 --> 00:07:20.300
You needed back-up in dealing

176
00:07:20.433 --> 00:07:22.400
with your difficult
Editor-in-Chief?

177
00:07:22.533 --> 00:07:25.867
I thought
you go back a long way.

178
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.233
It might be reassuring.

179
00:07:28.367 --> 00:07:29.967
Right.

180
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.400
Always a pleasure. Roger.

181
00:07:32.533 --> 00:07:33.633
The pleasure is mine.

182
00:07:33.767 --> 00:07:34.967
Father.

183
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.800
Let me try to calm

184
00:07:39.934 --> 00:07:42.133
the predictable
tension between you.

185
00:07:42.266 --> 00:07:44.400
As Editor of The Look.

186
00:07:44.533 --> 00:07:47.200
Claudia is one of
our most valuable assets.

187
00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:49.133
She's naturally very
protective of the content.

188
00:07:49.266 --> 00:07:52.233
As the publisher.
Derek's job is to make sure

189
00:07:52.367 --> 00:07:53.700
the magazine's profitable.

190
00:07:53.834 --> 00:07:55.567
He bailed out two of
our other publications

191
00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.300
by amping up
their digital presence.

192
00:07:57.433 --> 00:08:00.633
Does that mean you'll leave
the print magazine alone?

193
00:08:00.767 --> 00:08:04.333
Initially. yes.
but the research and results

194
00:08:04.467 --> 00:08:06.667
from the digital magazine
will be applied to the print

195
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.967
as we move forward.

196
00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.100
I see.

197
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.767
I leave it to you and Derek
to work out your differences.

198
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.033
but you need to know.
he speaks for me.

199
00:08:18.133 --> 00:08:21.333
And I will continue
to speak for me

200
00:08:21.467 --> 00:08:23.633
and the magazine
that I helped to build.

201
00:08:23.767 --> 00:08:25.166
Good day. fellas.

202
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.367
- Claudia.
- Liza!

203
00:08:30.767 --> 00:08:33.800
This is harder
than it looks.

204
00:08:33.934 --> 00:08:35.767
Heaven forbid a Prada belt
ends up in the same shot

205
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:36.800
as an Armani pantsuit.

206
00:08:36.934 --> 00:08:39.633
I want your problems.

207
00:08:39.767 --> 00:08:42.000
When I started as a temp.
I was so excited to have a job

208
00:08:42.133 --> 00:08:43.800
in the fashion industry.

209
00:08:43.934 --> 00:08:45.500
I just didn't think
I would still be in

210
00:08:45.633 --> 00:08:46.667
the same closet two years later.

211
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.367
It's a pretty nice closet.

212
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.700
Not for the fashion editor
I've always wanted to be.

213
00:08:51.834 --> 00:08:54.033
All these gorgeous dresses

214
00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:57.300
and none of them
would fit a girl my size.

215
00:08:57.433 --> 00:09:00.934
Hey. Claudia cannot
count past four.

216
00:09:01.066 --> 00:09:03.934
Seriously.
let's go check out the shoes.

217
00:09:04.066 --> 00:09:05.333
they come in all sizes.

218
00:09:05.467 --> 00:09:07.233
Yes!

219
00:09:10.066 --> 00:09:11.433
Oh. wow! Can I touch?

220
00:09:11.567 --> 00:09:12.433
- No.
- With my eyes?

221
00:09:12.567 --> 00:09:13.500
Sure!

222
00:09:13.633 --> 00:09:15.533
I wanted you to see The Closet

223
00:09:15.667 --> 00:09:17.734
and get an idea of
how the magazine

224
00:09:17.867 --> 00:09:19.934
and the fashion world intersect.

225
00:09:20.066 --> 00:09:23.433
I work very closely
with all the designers.

226
00:09:23.567 --> 00:09:24.734
Careers have been made
because of the looks

227
00:09:24.867 --> 00:09:26.266
put together in this room.

228
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.700
Yes. very impressive.

229
00:09:27.834 --> 00:09:29.333
Things get really
crazy around here

230
00:09:29.467 --> 00:09:31.567
as we gear up for Fashion Week.

231
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.333
Who is that guy
talking to Claudia?

232
00:09:33.467 --> 00:09:35.333
That's Derek Colby.

233
00:09:35.467 --> 00:09:36.934
Colby Publishing.

234
00:09:37.066 --> 00:09:39.367
Roger Colby's son.
they own a ton of magazines.

235
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.433
including this one.

236
00:09:41.567 --> 00:09:43.100
The Look is losing money
so they sent

237
00:09:43.233 --> 00:09:45.900
the Prince of Publishing
to help revive it.

238
00:09:46.033 --> 00:09:46.934
That's what they call him.

239
00:09:47.066 --> 00:09:48.266
Who calls him that?

240
00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.033
People. the press.
he's a hot topic.

241
00:09:50.166 --> 00:09:52.200
A dating site took a poll.
He was voted the 7th most

242
00:09:52.333 --> 00:09:54.367
eligible bachelor in New York.

243
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.000
Liza: Katie. where are you?

244
00:09:57.133 --> 00:09:59.734
Great. I'll need you to take
everything that you pulled

245
00:09:59.867 --> 00:10:01.200
to the fitting room.

246
00:10:01.333 --> 00:10:02.834
Claudia will want to
see it on the models.

247
00:10:02.967 --> 00:10:06.266
And I need to call
Umberto's agent right now.

248
00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.500
So. we'll see you
in the fitting room

249
00:10:08.633 --> 00:10:11.367
and we will show you how we
prepare for an editorial shoot.

250
00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:12.667
Can't wait.

251
00:10:14.233 --> 00:10:16.266
We are so happy
to have you here.

252
00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.700
Yup.

253
00:10:22.233 --> 00:10:24.400
Uh...

254
00:10:24.533 --> 00:10:25.533
It's you.

255
00:10:28.467 --> 00:10:29.934
Are you hiding?

256
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.333
You're hiding.

257
00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:34.934
No.

258
00:10:35.967 --> 00:10:37.433
Uh. hey.

259
00:10:37.567 --> 00:10:40.567
We met at
a coffee shop this morning.

260
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.200
Yes. we have all this history
and I don't even know your name.

261
00:10:43.333 --> 00:10:46.934
Ella Richards.
and I'm Katie. by the way.

262
00:10:47.066 --> 00:10:50.900
Oh. it's. uh.
very nice to meet you.

263
00:10:51.033 --> 00:10:52.166
Why didn't you say who you were?

264
00:10:54.033 --> 00:10:56.233
And what was that about
being new and nervous?

265
00:10:56.367 --> 00:10:58.900
Well. I am new and I am nervous.

266
00:10:59.033 --> 00:11:02.500
I have to make
this company solvent.

267
00:11:02.633 --> 00:11:05.000
You see. most people are
intimidated by my name

268
00:11:05.133 --> 00:11:09.000
and. well.
I was enjoying your honesty.

269
00:11:09.133 --> 00:11:10.633
Why would I be intimidated?

270
00:11:10.767 --> 00:11:14.734
I don't work here.
and I am just helping.

271
00:11:14.867 --> 00:11:18.300
I'm sorry.
I have to-- I have to go.

272
00:11:18.433 --> 00:11:19.967
I think I can handle it.

273
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.200
Right.

274
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:28.600
Okay. he may not be your boss.
but he is mine.

275
00:11:28.734 --> 00:11:31.467
and my boss's boss and her boss.

276
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.433
try to resist
the urge to offend him.

277
00:11:34.567 --> 00:11:37.233
Okay. sure.
he's just so entitled.

278
00:11:37.367 --> 00:11:38.834
And so attractive.

279
00:11:38.967 --> 00:11:40.233
I hadn't noticed.

280
00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:42.300
Well. he seems to
have noticed you.

281
00:11:42.433 --> 00:11:44.900
Yeah. Well. the 7th most
eligible bachelor in New York

282
00:11:45.033 --> 00:11:46.400
is not my kind of guy.

283
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:53.400
♪ Lovin' somebody ♪

284
00:11:53.533 --> 00:11:57.000
♪ Having somebody ♪

285
00:11:57.133 --> 00:11:59.300
Claudia will want
to see the cargo pants

286
00:11:59.433 --> 00:12:01.433
both with and without
the Hermes belt.

287
00:12:03.367 --> 00:12:04.633
How's it going?

288
00:12:04.767 --> 00:12:06.734
This dress doesn't
need to be shorter.

289
00:12:06.867 --> 00:12:08.333
it needs to taper at the knee.

290
00:12:08.467 --> 00:12:10.066
It's going to look boxy.

291
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.166
And you are?

292
00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:12.467
This is Ella.

293
00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.166
She's helping with
the photo shoot.

294
00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.700
Less opinion. more sewing.
We're on a deadline.

295
00:12:16.834 --> 00:12:19.633
Umberto's shoots
can be so intense.

296
00:12:19.767 --> 00:12:22.500
he's very unpredictable.

297
00:12:22.633 --> 00:12:24.066
Derek. hi.

298
00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.266
Would you give me a minute?

299
00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.500
Well. you got better
knees than I do.

300
00:12:29.633 --> 00:12:31.900
I busted mine playing
basketball in college.

301
00:12:32.033 --> 00:12:35.033
Prepping for a shoot
is always daunting.

302
00:12:35.166 --> 00:12:37.367
So many decisions to make.

303
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:41.467
Do you think the side ruching
is distorting the bodice?

304
00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.166
Um...

305
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:45.867
Yeah. um--

306
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.834
There may be too many
folds in the ruching.

307
00:12:48.967 --> 00:12:50.633
the way it gathers at the waist.

308
00:12:52.467 --> 00:12:53.500
What she said.

309
00:12:53.633 --> 00:12:55.000
Is this your interpreter?

310
00:12:57.433 --> 00:13:01.800
Yes. Yes. for the moment she is.

311
00:13:01.934 --> 00:13:03.100
Liza: Umberto says he wants
approval on all the models.

312
00:13:03.233 --> 00:13:06.133
Yes. This is a fashion magazine.

313
00:13:06.266 --> 00:13:07.800
The details are life and death.

314
00:13:07.934 --> 00:13:09.233
Thank you. Claudia.

315
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.266
How can you be in
charge of this place

316
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.066
if you don't know
what ruching is?

317
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.600
Well. I just assumed
it was the crumpled up

318
00:13:16.734 --> 00:13:18.066
fabric on the side there.

319
00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.066
It's how you
crumple it that matters.

320
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.300
Oh. wow. Okay.

321
00:13:23.433 --> 00:13:25.633
I admit I have a lot to learn.

322
00:13:25.767 --> 00:13:26.700
You think?

323
00:13:26.834 --> 00:13:28.400
I do.

324
00:13:28.533 --> 00:13:29.934
And I don't have
a lot of time to learn it.

325
00:13:30.066 --> 00:13:31.400
♪ Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh ♪

326
00:13:31.533 --> 00:13:33.600
Oh. there you are.

327
00:13:33.734 --> 00:13:35.200
How was your first
day at school?

328
00:13:35.333 --> 00:13:36.767
I need a crash
course in fashion.

329
00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.133
There is no such thing.

330
00:13:38.266 --> 00:13:39.767
Well. you're a seamstress.

331
00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.633
I'm sure you could teach me
a few of the basics.

332
00:13:41.767 --> 00:13:44.300
I'm not just handy
with a needle and thread.

333
00:13:44.433 --> 00:13:46.300
I'm also a designer.

334
00:13:46.433 --> 00:13:47.934
That's great.
Gives you more credibility.

335
00:13:48.066 --> 00:13:48.934
With who?

336
00:13:49.066 --> 00:13:50.066
With me.

337
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.300
What's happening is Claudia
is using my lack of knowledge

338
00:13:56.433 --> 00:13:58.767
about fashion to
undermine my authority.

339
00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:02.433
I'm sorry. but I resent your
authority as much as she does.

340
00:14:02.567 --> 00:14:03.800
Are you following me?

341
00:14:03.934 --> 00:14:05.767
I was about to
ask you the same thing.

342
00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.767
Are you working at
the magazine tomorrow?

343
00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.300
I'll be there until
the photo shoot's over.

344
00:14:09.433 --> 00:14:10.667
and then I'm gone.

345
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.533
Great. Have coffee
with me in the morning.

346
00:14:13.667 --> 00:14:16.367
I want to learn fashion
from someone who loves it.

347
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:17.700
How do you know I love it?

348
00:14:17.834 --> 00:14:20.533
Because you hate
the fact that I don't.

349
00:14:20.667 --> 00:14:22.533
Come on. One cup.

350
00:14:22.667 --> 00:14:24.166
Say yes.

351
00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.300
Okay.

352
00:14:25.433 --> 00:14:26.333
- No. I said. "Say yes."
- Yes!

353
00:14:26.467 --> 00:14:27.600
Perfect.

354
00:14:27.734 --> 00:14:28.633
This is not how
I saw us ending up.

355
00:14:28.767 --> 00:14:30.967
So you admit there's an us.

356
00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:33.100
Whatever.

357
00:14:33.233 --> 00:14:35.533
I've never heard three
syllables sound so encouraging.

358
00:14:38.133 --> 00:14:40.867
Ella: Thanks again for
coming to my loft.

359
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.367
My homemade boutique.

360
00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.266
So. what's the occasion again?

361
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.367
Bobby's parents are having the
engagement party at their house.

362
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.467
Oh.

363
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.867
I'm meeting his whole family.

364
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.700
Well. you have picked
the perfect dress.

365
00:14:53.834 --> 00:14:55.867
I love this colour on you.

366
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.033
I never really thought of
myself as the lavender type.

367
00:14:59.166 --> 00:15:03.633
just black. understated.
trying to disappear.

368
00:15:05.633 --> 00:15:06.667
What do you think?

369
00:15:10.967 --> 00:15:12.900
I don't know how to thank you.

370
00:15:13.033 --> 00:15:16.767
Well. when you feel beautiful.
you look beautiful. Yes?

371
00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.300
- Yes.
- Yes.

372
00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.033
I'm revamping
the digital magazine

373
00:15:24.166 --> 00:15:25.867
and I want to go live
during Fashion Week.

374
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.433
So. I don't have much
time to get up to speed.

375
00:15:28.567 --> 00:15:32.767
Well. this is my first time
teaching Fashion 101.

376
00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.166
Thank you.

377
00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.900
So. I'll begin with
what I know best.

378
00:15:37.033 --> 00:15:38.233
Okay.

379
00:15:38.367 --> 00:15:39.867
I always have
a sketchbook with me.

380
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.533
my sewing gigs. everywhere.

381
00:15:41.667 --> 00:15:44.266
You never know when
inspiration will strike.

382
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.934
Just to be clear.
I'm not looking for an opinion

383
00:15:47.066 --> 00:15:49.734
on my work. this is
strictly a learning tool.

384
00:15:49.867 --> 00:15:51.834
Okay. No opinions.

385
00:15:51.967 --> 00:15:53.900
Okay. I have
a philosophy about design.

386
00:15:54.033 --> 00:15:55.567
I call it
the IFFF Factor.

387
00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.066
That's spelled with one I
followed by three F's.

388
00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:01.400
It stands for Inspiration.
Fabric. Fit. and Financials.

389
00:16:01.533 --> 00:16:02.967
I-F-F-F. Got it.

390
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.333
Okay.

391
00:16:04.467 --> 00:16:06.934
Inspiration can
come from anywhere.

392
00:16:07.066 --> 00:16:10.834
A movie. a book. a colour
you can't get out of your head.

393
00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.433
This dress is all about fabric.

394
00:16:15.567 --> 00:16:17.066
I went nuts for this brocade.

395
00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:20.500
Fit is about
understanding the contours

396
00:16:20.633 --> 00:16:22.000
of a woman's body

397
00:16:22.133 --> 00:16:24.633
and helping her to embrace them.

398
00:16:24.767 --> 00:16:26.734
I know I'm not
supposed to do this.

399
00:16:26.867 --> 00:16:30.400
but these.
these are really good.

400
00:16:30.533 --> 00:16:31.900
Well. you don't know
enough to know they're good.

401
00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:34.166
but. um. thank you.

402
00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.834
Financials is making sure
the woman can afford it.

403
00:16:37.967 --> 00:16:41.266
I don't want the price tag
to overwhelm the joy they get

404
00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.967
from wearing the dress.

405
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:47.500
That. that might be the most
important thing you said.

406
00:16:47.633 --> 00:16:50.433
See. I'm trying to make the
publications more accessible.

407
00:16:50.567 --> 00:16:52.300
but my father is
resistant to change.

408
00:16:52.433 --> 00:16:54.000
and his father
founded the company.

409
00:16:54.133 --> 00:16:55.834
and he's the exact same way.

410
00:16:55.967 --> 00:16:58.433
So. the Prince of Publishing
hashtag is for real.

411
00:16:58.567 --> 00:17:00.967
Inheriting a publishing dynasty
is not such a terrible fate.

412
00:17:04.934 --> 00:17:07.000
You're very hard to read.

413
00:17:07.133 --> 00:17:08.500
What are you thinking?

414
00:17:10.266 --> 00:17:12.233
That our backgrounds
are nothing alike.

415
00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:17.333
I grew up in Pittsburgh.

416
00:17:17.467 --> 00:17:20.834
My dad worked in a textile mill.

417
00:17:20.967 --> 00:17:22.500
He'd bring home
all these end-pieces

418
00:17:22.633 --> 00:17:24.233
and I would sew them together.

419
00:17:24.367 --> 00:17:27.533
He must be so proud
that you became a designer.

420
00:17:27.667 --> 00:17:31.000
He passed away when I was a kid.

421
00:17:31.133 --> 00:17:33.700
Ah. I'm sorry.

422
00:17:33.834 --> 00:17:36.834
That's okay.
my mom is proud enough for two.

423
00:17:40.934 --> 00:17:43.066
Ooh. I'm late for Oscar.

424
00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.567
- Who's Oscar?
- The man I can't live without.

425
00:17:48.333 --> 00:17:50.200
Ella: So. this is where
the magic happens.

426
00:17:50.333 --> 00:17:54.500
It is. Whenever I parachute in
to save one of our publications.

427
00:17:54.633 --> 00:17:58.233
I always take Oscar with me
to run the digital side.

428
00:17:58.367 --> 00:17:59.734
Nice to meet you.

429
00:17:59.867 --> 00:18:02.800
Ella here is going to
make me fashion-savvy.

430
00:18:02.934 --> 00:18:05.567
Savvy might be overreaching.

431
00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:06.734
Yeah.

432
00:18:06.867 --> 00:18:08.533
Look. What we're doing here

433
00:18:08.667 --> 00:18:10.767
can't be an online replica
of the print version.

434
00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:14.767
We want to produce new.
fresh. more relevant content.

435
00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:16.467
That might get us
more traffic ad-buys.

436
00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.567
which are running really low.

437
00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:21.133
Right.

438
00:18:21.266 --> 00:18:23.367
Most women can barely
afford the magazine.

439
00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.233
let alone the clothes
they see inside.

440
00:18:25.367 --> 00:18:27.967
That's kind of my thing.

441
00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:29.700
bringing fashion to the masses.

442
00:18:29.834 --> 00:18:31.900
Yeah. I'm getting that.

443
00:18:32.033 --> 00:18:34.266
Fashion has been ignoring
the women who aren't models.

444
00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.033
and there are a lot more of us
than there are size twos.

445
00:18:37.166 --> 00:18:38.600
You have a chance
to change that.

446
00:18:38.734 --> 00:18:40.533
and double your readership
while you're at it.

447
00:18:40.667 --> 00:18:43.967
Well. I think you got a point.

448
00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.066
Let me think about it.

449
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.767
Hello again.

450
00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.300
Hey. Oscar.

451
00:18:49.433 --> 00:18:51.467
Katie gave me
a tour of The Closet

452
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.433
and all the hottest designers.

453
00:18:53.567 --> 00:18:54.800
Lucky you.

454
00:18:54.934 --> 00:18:56.467
We are setting up
for the photo shoot

455
00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.867
and the stylist needs
to make some alterations.

456
00:18:59.000 --> 00:18:59.867
Mm-hm.

457
00:19:00.066 --> 00:19:01.500
Okay.

458
00:19:01.633 --> 00:19:04.367
Umberto is the best
photographer in the business

459
00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:05.800
and an editorial shoot
is a great way

460
00:19:05.934 --> 00:19:07.533
to learn about fashion.

461
00:19:07.667 --> 00:19:08.633
You should be there.

462
00:19:08.767 --> 00:19:11.033
Well. okay.

463
00:19:11.166 --> 00:19:14.967
Oscar: I can't tell if
she's the boss or the assistant.

464
00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:16.133
Yeah. me either.

465
00:19:27.133 --> 00:19:28.834
♪ Sometimes ♪

466
00:19:28.967 --> 00:19:32.133
♪ It's like we're
spinning out of control ♪

467
00:19:36.166 --> 00:19:37.367
Give me more eyes.

468
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.200
That's it.
I love this shot.

469
00:19:40.333 --> 00:19:43.133
Yes! Can we get more
light on Jasmine please?

470
00:19:45.433 --> 00:19:46.934
A puff sleeve is
hard to pull off.

471
00:19:47.066 --> 00:19:49.700
but I think it's perfection.

472
00:19:49.834 --> 00:19:52.300
Who is that person?

473
00:19:52.433 --> 00:19:54.266
Some sewer
who latched onto Derek.

474
00:19:56.133 --> 00:19:58.200
Umberto thinks
I'm a little shiny.

475
00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.367
You need to sign off on Manolo's
Long Live Stilettos spread.

476
00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:06.934
Alright. Keep an eye
on Derek while I'm gone.

477
00:20:07.066 --> 00:20:10.467
I don't want him having opinions
and ruining the shoot.

478
00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:14.200
Derek. We met at a party
in the Hamptons last summer.

479
00:20:14.333 --> 00:20:15.200
Do you remember?

480
00:20:15.333 --> 00:20:16.867
Yes. I do.

481
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.100
You're hard to forget.

482
00:20:18.233 --> 00:20:19.667
It's nice to see you again.

483
00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:20.800
Yeah. you too.

484
00:20:26.333 --> 00:20:27.600
Mr. DeLuca--

485
00:20:27.734 --> 00:20:30.867
That's my father.
I'm Bert.

486
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.600
May I just say that picture
you took of the kid looking up

487
00:20:33.734 --> 00:20:36.100
at the high-fashion
glamazon in the Bronx is just.

488
00:20:36.233 --> 00:20:37.367
it's one of
my all-time favourites.

489
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.333
May I say.
you have good taste.

490
00:20:39.467 --> 00:20:40.967
it's one of
my favourites too.

491
00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.000
Excuse me.
Ella. is it?

492
00:20:43.133 --> 00:20:44.767
Umberto is very busy.

493
00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.433
What do you
do. Ella?

494
00:20:46.567 --> 00:20:49.433
Well. today I'm a sewer.
but I'm also a designer.

495
00:20:49.567 --> 00:20:50.834
And that outfit
you're wearing?

496
00:20:50.967 --> 00:20:51.834
Is one of my own.

497
00:20:51.967 --> 00:20:53.433
An Ella original.

498
00:20:53.567 --> 00:20:56.033
And now if we could
resume the shoot.

499
00:20:56.166 --> 00:20:57.367
Until we meet again.

500
00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:58.567
Ella:
Thank you.

501
00:21:00.467 --> 00:21:02.000
It looks like
you just made a friend.

502
00:21:02.133 --> 00:21:04.400
Yeah. well.
he's as nice as he is talented.

503
00:21:04.533 --> 00:21:07.066
Did I miss anything?

504
00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.934
What do you think
of the necklace. Ella?

505
00:21:09.066 --> 00:21:12.200
Obviously.
I missed a lot.

506
00:21:12.333 --> 00:21:15.000
Um. I think
the necklace is overkill.

507
00:21:15.133 --> 00:21:18.066
It competes
with the neckline.

508
00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.333
I agree.

509
00:21:19.467 --> 00:21:21.033
Wait a minute.

510
00:21:21.166 --> 00:21:24.100
The jeweler bought a four-page
spread in this issue.

511
00:21:24.233 --> 00:21:25.834
This page is not for sale.

512
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.166
Much better.

513
00:21:40.633 --> 00:21:43.066
That honesty thing
you got going on?

514
00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.166
I like it.

515
00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:48.967
Derek has some nobody
sewer calling the shots?

516
00:21:50.533 --> 00:21:53.100
Is he really that clueless
or is he testing me?

517
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.967
Either way.
he's going to regret it.

518
00:22:06.834 --> 00:22:09.867
Ella. do you
have a minute?

519
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:10.900
What's up?

520
00:22:11.033 --> 00:22:12.266
Can we go to my office?

521
00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.934
There's something
I'd like to discuss.

522
00:22:14.066 --> 00:22:16.600
This season's emphasis
on asymmetrical hemlines?

523
00:22:16.734 --> 00:22:18.467
No. but we can go over that too.

524
00:22:22.133 --> 00:22:24.367
I'm still moving in.

525
00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:25.900
Still trying to get
used to the office

526
00:22:26.033 --> 00:22:27.934
and all the responsibilities
that go with it.

527
00:22:30.066 --> 00:22:31.000
What did you want to talk about?

528
00:22:31.133 --> 00:22:32.233
You and me.

529
00:22:32.367 --> 00:22:35.400
Maybe we should
stick with hemlines.

530
00:22:35.533 --> 00:22:37.333
Well. we can talk hemlines.
necklines. and anything else

531
00:22:37.467 --> 00:22:40.700
you think I need to know.
that's kind of the point.

532
00:22:41.834 --> 00:22:43.400
I hope I'm not intruding.

533
00:22:43.533 --> 00:22:45.200
Actually--

534
00:22:45.333 --> 00:22:46.900
The art director asked
if you want to see the proofs

535
00:22:47.033 --> 00:22:49.266
from the photo shoot since
it's going to be the cover.

536
00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:53.033
Can you tell him
that I am in a meeting.

537
00:22:53.166 --> 00:22:54.633
and will be
with him in a moment.

538
00:23:01.867 --> 00:23:06.333
Meeting is executive-speak
for otherwise engaged.

539
00:23:06.467 --> 00:23:08.834
And what are we
engaged in exactly?

540
00:23:08.967 --> 00:23:10.367
A negotiation.

541
00:23:12.133 --> 00:23:14.000
I want to hire you
to be my consultant.

542
00:23:14.133 --> 00:23:15.800
to keep me from making
any fashion faux pas.

543
00:23:15.934 --> 00:23:18.667
You have a whole
staff to do that.

544
00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.266
Yeah. well.
most of the employees are

545
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.166
loyal to Claudia
and they see me as an intruder.

546
00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.734
I want an outsider.

547
00:23:24.867 --> 00:23:27.567
Someone who isn't
afraid to speak her mind.

548
00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:30.834
I don't want you to hire me.
or you'd be my boss.

549
00:23:30.967 --> 00:23:34.734
Okay. what do you want?

550
00:23:34.867 --> 00:23:39.400
I want a piece about me
in the digital magazine.

551
00:23:39.533 --> 00:23:41.667
as an up-and-coming designer.

552
00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.767
So. it would be quid pro quo.

553
00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:46.500
I'd rather have
your respect than a pay cheque

554
00:23:46.633 --> 00:23:48.900
Great. then we have a deal.

555
00:23:49.033 --> 00:23:51.633
Just like that?

556
00:23:51.767 --> 00:23:53.100
Just like that.
My magazine. my call.

557
00:23:56.033 --> 00:23:57.433
I think this meeting
went pretty well.

558
00:24:06.967 --> 00:24:09.633
I want to include a signature
design in the article about me

559
00:24:09.767 --> 00:24:11.900
that really represents my brand.

560
00:24:12.033 --> 00:24:13.667
Very Ella original.

561
00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.066
All I have to do in return
is teach Derek about fashion.

562
00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:17.800
I'm already
planning his curriculum.

563
00:24:17.934 --> 00:24:21.066
Okay. what is
the Prince of Publishing like.

564
00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.533
up close and personal?

565
00:24:22.667 --> 00:24:25.967
Bored with being a prince.
that's my guess.

566
00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.633
I think that's
what he sees in me.

567
00:24:27.767 --> 00:24:29.667
I don't scrape and bow
whenever he walks into a room.

568
00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.400
What do you do?

569
00:24:31.533 --> 00:24:33.500
I just tell him the truth.

570
00:24:33.633 --> 00:24:35.300
And what do you tell yourself?

571
00:24:35.433 --> 00:24:38.200
To keep my eye on the prize.
get my name in the magazine.

572
00:24:38.333 --> 00:24:40.834
and not get distracted
by some unattainable guy

573
00:24:40.967 --> 00:24:42.200
with a million-dollar smile.

574
00:24:42.333 --> 00:24:43.567
You tell yourself all that?

575
00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.333
Yes. and I mean every word.

576
00:24:46.467 --> 00:24:47.433
Okay.

577
00:24:49.867 --> 00:24:54.166
I'm good with being myself
and being curvy.

578
00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.767
and it took me a long time
to say that. I just...

579
00:24:59.467 --> 00:25:01.233
...have to keep saying it.

580
00:25:01.367 --> 00:25:04.066
Anybody who doesn't see how
great you are. that's their bad.

581
00:25:06.767 --> 00:25:10.867
I so like Derek.
as a person. I mean.

582
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.767
I just can't figure out
what makes him tick.

583
00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.633
So. bring it in.

584
00:25:19.166 --> 00:25:21.600
Okay. so. dribbling is like
a dance you do with the ball.

585
00:25:21.734 --> 00:25:25.633
Okay?
In perfect rhythm. perfect sync.

586
00:25:25.767 --> 00:25:28.300
Who wants to give it a try?
What about you?

587
00:25:30.734 --> 00:25:31.934
That's it! Nice footwork.

588
00:25:32.066 --> 00:25:33.567
I love that.

589
00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.800
Eddie.
why don't you give it a try?

590
00:25:38.166 --> 00:25:39.633
Good. Oh! Nice try.

591
00:25:39.767 --> 00:25:41.000
One more. okay?

592
00:25:42.767 --> 00:25:44.066
You got it. Hey. come here.

593
00:25:46.266 --> 00:25:49.400
It's not just
about height. okay?

594
00:25:49.533 --> 00:25:53.433
It's about heart.
and you got plenty of both.

595
00:25:53.567 --> 00:25:55.066
So. why don't you
give it another try?

596
00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.400
Never give up.

597
00:25:58.233 --> 00:25:59.200
- Derek.
- Oh. Hey. Harry.

598
00:25:59.333 --> 00:26:00.934
- How you doing?
- Good. man.

599
00:26:01.066 --> 00:26:02.000
The team's looking
good this year.

600
00:26:02.133 --> 00:26:03.533
Yeah. they're a great group.

601
00:26:03.667 --> 00:26:05.333
Listen.
I was thinking we should start

602
00:26:05.467 --> 00:26:06.967
an arts program for the kids.

603
00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:08.967
Not just painting.
but music. too.

604
00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.433
They got a lot to say.

605
00:26:10.567 --> 00:26:13.000
and it's not always easy
to say it with words.

606
00:26:13.133 --> 00:26:14.700
That would be great.

607
00:26:14.834 --> 00:26:16.300
Yeah. I'm crazy busy
with work right now.

608
00:26:16.433 --> 00:26:19.967
but as soon as I come up
for air. let's get started okay?

609
00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:23.200
Alright. guys. We're going to do
a horseshoe formation. alright?

610
00:26:26.467 --> 00:26:27.934
The graphics. they
need more definition.

611
00:26:28.066 --> 00:26:30.667
If we get any eyeballs.
this is not going to keep them.

612
00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:31.934
Understood.

613
00:26:32.066 --> 00:26:34.433
And what about the logos?

614
00:26:34.567 --> 00:26:35.934
Mm. one on the left.

615
00:26:37.734 --> 00:26:39.667
There you are.

616
00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:42.133
Uh. here I am.

617
00:26:42.266 --> 00:26:45.266
I wondered if
you wanted to have lunch.

618
00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.467
You know what?
I'm already booked. Sorry.

619
00:26:50.233 --> 00:26:51.800
Hello. Ella.

620
00:26:51.934 --> 00:26:54.867
Hi. Are you ready to go?

621
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.200
- I am.
- Where are you guys going?

622
00:26:56.333 --> 00:26:58.166
On a field trip.

623
00:26:58.300 --> 00:26:59.266
Where?

624
00:27:00.834 --> 00:27:02.200
The Garment District.

625
00:27:02.333 --> 00:27:03.867
Why?

626
00:27:04.967 --> 00:27:07.700
For some Fashion 101.

627
00:27:13.533 --> 00:27:15.266
Clothing is a form
of self-expression.

628
00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.066
Every morning
when you get dressed.

629
00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.834
it's like a painter
with a canvas.

630
00:27:19.967 --> 00:27:23.900
And those canvasses come
in all shapes and sizes.

631
00:27:24.033 --> 00:27:26.500
I'm sensing a theme here.

632
00:27:26.633 --> 00:27:30.734
Yeah. well. body positivity is
something I really believe in.

633
00:27:30.867 --> 00:27:33.233
If you feel beautiful.
you look beautiful.

634
00:27:33.367 --> 00:27:36.333
Okay. now for
some fashion basics.

635
00:27:36.467 --> 00:27:38.967
I promise I will leave
my soapbox at the door.

636
00:27:41.233 --> 00:27:42.900
...better here.
You gotta watch the sequins.

637
00:27:43.033 --> 00:27:45.000
Okay and watch
that shoulder...

638
00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:53.066
This is where the rubber meets
the runway before Fashion Week.

639
00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.567
There are a lot of
looks in a collection

640
00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:57.266
and they all have
to be stand-outs.

641
00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.734
Hello. hello!

642
00:27:58.867 --> 00:28:00.300
Ella: Thank you for letting
us look around.

643
00:28:00.433 --> 00:28:02.600
- You bet.
- This is Max Rintels.

644
00:28:02.734 --> 00:28:04.166
Derek.

645
00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:06.166
He is the heart and soul
of the Garment District.

646
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.300
The rag-trade
is in my genes.

647
00:28:08.433 --> 00:28:09.767
My father was a pusher.

648
00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.567
A... a pusher?

649
00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.433
That's what they call the guys
who push racks of clothes

650
00:28:13.567 --> 00:28:16.133
from jobber to jobber
on 7th Avenue.

651
00:28:16.266 --> 00:28:17.834
And my mom worked
in a sweatshop.

652
00:28:17.967 --> 00:28:21.300
I know a little bit about
going into the family business.

653
00:28:21.433 --> 00:28:22.934
Oh. yeah?
What line of work are you in?

654
00:28:23.066 --> 00:28:24.233
Publishing.

655
00:28:24.367 --> 00:28:25.633
He works at
The Look magazine.

656
00:28:25.767 --> 00:28:27.100
Oh. yeah.
what do you do there?

657
00:28:27.233 --> 00:28:28.467
I. um...

658
00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:29.500
His family owns it.

659
00:28:29.633 --> 00:28:32.433
Right.

660
00:28:32.567 --> 00:28:33.900
Nice work.
if you can get it.

661
00:28:34.033 --> 00:28:35.800
I'm giving him
a crash course on fashion.

662
00:28:35.934 --> 00:28:39.266
Ah. well.
if you're okay with Ella.

663
00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:40.500
you're okay with me.

664
00:28:43.934 --> 00:28:47.433
Fabric is the first
F in IFFF.

665
00:28:47.567 --> 00:28:49.633
It doesn't just dictate
how a design will look.

666
00:28:49.767 --> 00:28:51.400
but how it feels.

667
00:28:51.533 --> 00:28:53.133
We call that a fabric's hand.

668
00:28:53.266 --> 00:28:54.433
Okay.

669
00:28:54.567 --> 00:28:57.767
Silk has a very
soft and sensual hand.

670
00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.967
- Okay.
- Go ahead and give it a try it.

671
00:29:04.934 --> 00:29:07.500
Yeah.
I see what you mean.

672
00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:19.500
Okay. Let's hit the next
stop on our fashion tour.

673
00:29:19.633 --> 00:29:21.367
Sure. uh. after you.

674
00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:22.967
Thank you.

675
00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.700
This is a typical
women's clothing store.

676
00:29:38.834 --> 00:29:39.700
Okay.

677
00:29:39.834 --> 00:29:42.100
Whether it's a high-end boutique

678
00:29:42.233 --> 00:29:44.300
or a chain store at the mall.
the sizes go from two to 14.

679
00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:52.800
That salesgirl right there is
straight out of "Pretty Woman."

680
00:29:52.934 --> 00:29:55.433
She wants to tell me
I don't belong here.

681
00:29:55.567 --> 00:29:57.567
Well. I have got news for her.

682
00:29:59.867 --> 00:30:03.100
The average size of
the American woman is 16.

683
00:30:03.233 --> 00:30:05.266
Since we're the vast majority.
maybe it's time they start

684
00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:08.433
stocking stores
with things that fit.

685
00:30:08.567 --> 00:30:12.567
Sorry. sometimes the soapbox
sneaks up on me.

686
00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:14.367
You're cute when you get mad.

687
00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:15.467
Don't patronize me.

688
00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.200
I'm not. How about this?

689
00:30:18.333 --> 00:30:20.266
You're ferocious
when you get mad.

690
00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.100
That's better.

691
00:30:22.233 --> 00:30:23.900
I have a question.

692
00:30:24.033 --> 00:30:26.633
Do women dress for themselves
or do they dress for others?

693
00:30:26.767 --> 00:30:29.300
It depends which woman
we're talking about.

694
00:30:29.433 --> 00:30:30.734
Let's talk about you.

695
00:30:30.867 --> 00:30:32.867
I'm just looking in the mirror

696
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.133
and trying to be
the me I want to be.

697
00:30:36.266 --> 00:30:38.867
Wow. I'm not sure if
there's a right answer.

698
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.200
but. if there is.
I'm pretty sure that was it.

699
00:30:43.333 --> 00:30:45.734
Yeah. well.
it wasn't always the case.

700
00:30:45.867 --> 00:30:47.533
Mirrors used
to be the enemy.

701
00:30:47.667 --> 00:30:49.600
and now they're just
a piece of glass.

702
00:30:49.734 --> 00:30:52.867
- What I see is up to me.
- Hm.

703
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.433
So what are we doing next?

704
00:30:55.567 --> 00:30:58.700
- People watching.
- Hm.

705
00:30:58.834 --> 00:31:02.467
She is on her lunch break
and she has to get back to work.

706
00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.300
The suit is a knock-off.
but. you know. she's ambitious.

707
00:31:04.433 --> 00:31:05.800
and one day it will
be the real thing.

708
00:31:05.934 --> 00:31:08.300
Does she read The Look?

709
00:31:08.433 --> 00:31:10.700
She springs for
the September issue once a year.

710
00:31:12.166 --> 00:31:14.767
And what do you see
when you look at me?

711
00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:20.600
Designer from head-to-toe.
Money is obviously not an issue.

712
00:31:20.734 --> 00:31:23.033
I see the 7th most
eligible bachelor in New York.

713
00:31:23.166 --> 00:31:26.600
Yeah. well. don't believe
everything you hear.

714
00:31:27.767 --> 00:31:29.867
It's. uh-- It's not who I am.

715
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
Okay.

716
00:31:32.133 --> 00:31:33.200
So. is today about
teaching me fashion

717
00:31:33.333 --> 00:31:35.166
or making The Look
more inclusive?

718
00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:36.700
It's both.

719
00:31:36.834 --> 00:31:38.133
See that girl and her mother?

720
00:31:38.266 --> 00:31:39.967
That was me and my mom
when I was a kid.

721
00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:46.266
She used to take me
from store to store.

722
00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.367
and one day I asked her why.

723
00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.934
And she said that they
didn't have what we wanted

724
00:31:52.066 --> 00:31:53.533
in my favourite colour.

725
00:31:53.667 --> 00:31:55.834
And what's your
favourite colour?

726
00:31:55.967 --> 00:31:59.367
Blue. but then I got older.
and I realized that

727
00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.767
she didn't take me from store to
store because they didn't have

728
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:03.467
it in my colour. they just...

729
00:32:06.633 --> 00:32:08.266
...didn't have it in my size.

730
00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:16.400
You're very persuasive.

731
00:32:16.533 --> 00:32:17.400
And what are you?

732
00:32:17.533 --> 00:32:19.166
Convinced.

733
00:32:20.867 --> 00:32:23.767
Okay. Wow. great!

734
00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:25.033
You know.
maybe you should try being

735
00:32:25.166 --> 00:32:26.166
a little more enthusiastic.

736
00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:27.367
Oh.

737
00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.600
I think it would
look good on you.

738
00:32:29.734 --> 00:32:31.033
I got a meeting
with some advertisers.

739
00:32:31.166 --> 00:32:33.667
but I'm looking forward
to our next lesson.

740
00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.266
Me. too.

741
00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.700
Woman: Hey. slow down!

742
00:32:36.834 --> 00:32:38.767
- Hi.
- Hi.

743
00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.433
Are we celebrating something?

744
00:32:40.567 --> 00:32:42.266
Uh. no.

745
00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:44.333
That could have been ugly.

746
00:32:44.467 --> 00:32:46.166
Oh. Right. Um...

747
00:32:47.834 --> 00:32:48.734
Thank you.

748
00:32:48.867 --> 00:32:51.000
You're... You're welcome.

749
00:32:58.967 --> 00:33:01.300
Do you always get
that dressed up to sew?

750
00:33:01.433 --> 00:33:05.400
Only when I'm a fan
of my employer.

751
00:33:05.533 --> 00:33:08.100
I used to work as
a sewer to pay my bills.

752
00:33:08.233 --> 00:33:09.767
Most designers can't sew.

753
00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.834
They have the vision.
but not the talent.

754
00:33:11.967 --> 00:33:13.467
You two have a lot in common.

755
00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.500
and by that
I mean actual talent.

756
00:33:16.633 --> 00:33:17.600
Show Annie your sketchbook.

757
00:33:17.734 --> 00:33:20.600
Max. you're embarrassing me.

758
00:33:20.734 --> 00:33:22.633
Embarrassed looks good on you.
show her the sketchbook.

759
00:33:22.767 --> 00:33:24.033
I'd really like to see it.

760
00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:27.433
Okay. Uh...

761
00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:41.934
You're even better
than Max said.

762
00:33:42.066 --> 00:33:43.266
Told you.

763
00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:50.500
Mm. These are nice.

764
00:33:50.633 --> 00:33:52.934
It may be time to
give up your day job.

765
00:33:56.133 --> 00:33:57.100
Thank you.

766
00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:02.133
I need you to make me a promise.

767
00:34:03.533 --> 00:34:04.900
When you hit it big.

768
00:34:05.033 --> 00:34:07.900
you stay exactly who you are.

769
00:34:08.033 --> 00:34:09.433
Yeah.

770
00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.400
♪ Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh ♪

771
00:34:13.533 --> 00:34:15.333
Okay. don't get
too excited about this.

772
00:34:15.467 --> 00:34:18.066
but I asked Max
if you could talk to

773
00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:19.867
Annie about buying an ad.

774
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.400
That was very nice of you.

775
00:34:21.533 --> 00:34:23.367
Well. I got a stake
in this thing succeeding.

776
00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:25.066
There you are!

777
00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:28.300
I had an idea
I couldn't wait to share.

778
00:34:28.433 --> 00:34:30.800
We should have a party that
coincides with Fashion Week.

779
00:34:30.934 --> 00:34:33.233
A big splashy event to
celebrate the relaunch of

780
00:34:33.367 --> 00:34:35.900
the digital magazine
with you at the helm.

781
00:34:37.333 --> 00:34:40.166
Well. the party would
get us some press

782
00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:42.200
and that might
generate some buzz.

783
00:34:42.333 --> 00:34:44.066
I ran it past Claudia
and got her okay.

784
00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:46.033
I told her it was a way
to publicly divvy up

785
00:34:46.166 --> 00:34:47.066
your two domains.

786
00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:48.867
If you have your own domain.

787
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.333
you can make all
the changes you want.

788
00:34:50.467 --> 00:34:53.066
What kind of changes?

789
00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:56.734
I plan to make
the magazine more inclusive

790
00:34:56.867 --> 00:34:57.734
and broaden our reach.

791
00:34:57.867 --> 00:34:59.867
The Look is very inclusive.

792
00:35:00.066 --> 00:35:02.433
We use models of
every race and ethnicity.

793
00:35:02.567 --> 00:35:03.567
But not every size.

794
00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:05.400
That's a pretty big change.

795
00:35:05.533 --> 00:35:06.834
And it's long overdue.

796
00:35:09.367 --> 00:35:10.867
I want to give this
new direction a shot.

797
00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:16.133
I'm really impressed by your
willingness to take a risk.

798
00:35:16.266 --> 00:35:20.900
I want to throw you a party as
big and as bold as your vision.

799
00:35:21.033 --> 00:35:22.700
A party would be great.

800
00:35:22.834 --> 00:35:23.767
Thanks. Liza.

801
00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:39.567
Oscar: So this is how
the other half lives.

802
00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:40.967
You've never been here before?

803
00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:43.166
No. I would remember.

804
00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:44.633
Do you play?

805
00:35:44.767 --> 00:35:48.900
Yeah. well.
with all that piano. I better.

806
00:35:49.033 --> 00:35:51.767
So. the 9th is when
Fashion Week starts.

807
00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:55.967
That gives us approximately

808
00:35:56.100 --> 00:36:00.066
three and a half weeks to
pull this whole thing off.

809
00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.166
No pressure.

810
00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:03.700
Yeah.

811
00:36:03.834 --> 00:36:04.700
No pressure.

812
00:36:04.834 --> 00:36:05.800
Cheers.

813
00:36:08.867 --> 00:36:10.734
Friends of yours?

814
00:36:10.867 --> 00:36:12.333
Yeah. You could say that.

815
00:36:14.533 --> 00:36:17.867
I've never seen
you smile so wide.

816
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.233
Where was this taken?

817
00:36:20.367 --> 00:36:21.500
I opened
a Youth Center in Brooklyn.

818
00:36:21.633 --> 00:36:24.133
You never told me that before.

819
00:36:24.266 --> 00:36:26.300
I know. I. uh--
I don't tell many people that.

820
00:36:26.433 --> 00:36:28.033
So. this is your
way of giving back.

821
00:36:28.166 --> 00:36:30.967
I get a lot more than I give.

822
00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:32.367
Those kids keep me grounded.

823
00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:34.867
Says the man in
the luxury penthouse apartment.

824
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.734
Come on.

825
00:36:36.867 --> 00:36:38.367
I'm moving. by the way.

826
00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:41.367
I'm looking for a townhouse
that I can restore.

827
00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:43.033
Something closer to the Center.

828
00:36:43.166 --> 00:36:44.467
Closer to who you want to be?

829
00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:48.900
Yeah. Yeah. something like that.

830
00:36:50.033 --> 00:36:52.300
You got this.

831
00:36:52.433 --> 00:36:53.734
Okay. I'm going to give
her the three pieces about

832
00:36:53.867 --> 00:36:54.800
Fashion Week to read.

833
00:36:54.934 --> 00:36:56.700
I love them all.

834
00:36:56.834 --> 00:36:58.834
Liza. do you have a moment?

835
00:36:58.967 --> 00:37:00.266
Derek: Oh. Ella!

836
00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.934
Annie Chew just gave us
an ad-buy!

837
00:37:02.066 --> 00:37:03.633
I mentioned body
inclusivity in our pitch

838
00:37:03.767 --> 00:37:05.800
and she said that's

839
00:37:05.934 --> 00:37:07.233
something she'd like to support.

840
00:37:07.367 --> 00:37:09.967
That is so great
on so many levels.

841
00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:15.233
I heard there was an opening
for an assistant fashion editor.

842
00:37:15.367 --> 00:37:17.233
and I was hoping you
could get Claudia to read

843
00:37:17.367 --> 00:37:18.633
some samples of my work.

844
00:37:18.767 --> 00:37:21.433
Claudia is incredibly busy.
and so am I.

845
00:37:21.567 --> 00:37:25.266
This party is
taking up all my time.

846
00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:28.200
I'm a little surprised you'd
ask for a favour right now.

847
00:37:28.333 --> 00:37:30.600
Timing is
everything. Katie.

848
00:37:40.266 --> 00:37:42.633
Hats are the best
thing ever.

849
00:37:42.767 --> 00:37:45.200
Most women are
the same size above the ears.

850
00:37:45.333 --> 00:37:47.567
and there are
no stigmas whatsoever.

851
00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.467
What happened with Liza?

852
00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:52.300
She shut me down.

853
00:37:54.667 --> 00:37:56.266
What? Let me see what I can do.

854
00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:57.967
Like what?

855
00:37:58.100 --> 00:37:58.967
I don't know.

856
00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:01.633
Where are you going?

857
00:38:01.767 --> 00:38:03.200
To talk to Derek.

858
00:38:03.333 --> 00:38:05.967
You might want to lose the hat.

859
00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:07.667
- Yes.
- Yeah.

860
00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.767
- Yeah. yeah. yeah.
- Yeah.

861
00:38:16.967 --> 00:38:19.800
I think Katie should
write the article about me.

862
00:38:19.934 --> 00:38:22.100
Okay. uh...

863
00:38:22.233 --> 00:38:24.200
Look. I know you two
are friends. but...

864
00:38:24.333 --> 00:38:25.433
She's a really good writer

865
00:38:25.567 --> 00:38:27.266
who wants to be
a fashion editor.

866
00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:29.967
No one knows me
better than she does.

867
00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:31.800
Oscar?

868
00:38:31.934 --> 00:38:36.467
It would make the piece more
personal which might be good.

869
00:38:39.433 --> 00:38:40.800
Okay.

870
00:38:40.934 --> 00:38:41.834
Excellent.

871
00:38:41.967 --> 00:38:43.266
Great.

872
00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:45.967
I should go.
I have a meeting with my father.

873
00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:47.767
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

874
00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:50.166
He needs luck
meeting with his dad?

875
00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:52.333
Roger Colby is about as
flexible as Mount Rushmore

876
00:38:52.467 --> 00:38:55.200
and Derek is trying
to reinvent the wheel.

877
00:38:55.333 --> 00:38:56.934
I'm mixing my metaphors.
but you get my point.

878
00:38:58.734 --> 00:39:00.767
Well. I don't care
what the board members say.

879
00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:03.934
It's not just about the numbers.
it's about making a difference.

880
00:39:04.066 --> 00:39:06.266
As the heir apparent to
a publishing institution.

881
00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:08.500
you sometimes sound quite naïve.

882
00:39:08.633 --> 00:39:10.033
Hm. Well--

883
00:39:10.166 --> 00:39:11.133
Ella!

884
00:39:12.633 --> 00:39:14.033
This is my father. Roger Colby.

885
00:39:14.166 --> 00:39:15.500
This is Ella Richards.

886
00:39:15.633 --> 00:39:16.500
It's nice to meet you.

887
00:39:16.633 --> 00:39:18.033
You too.

888
00:39:18.166 --> 00:39:20.033
Temper your idealism

889
00:39:20.166 --> 00:39:21.633
with the monetary realities.

890
00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:28.433
Temper your generational
blinders with the real world.

891
00:39:30.734 --> 00:39:32.266
I told Katie that
she was writing the article

892
00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.533
and she was thrilled.

893
00:39:33.667 --> 00:39:35.233
You did a good thing.

894
00:39:35.367 --> 00:39:39.200
As far as Colby's go.
you're pretty cool.

895
00:39:39.333 --> 00:39:41.500
Most people like me
because of my last name.

896
00:39:41.633 --> 00:39:43.600
You seem to like me
in spite of it.

897
00:39:43.734 --> 00:39:45.633
Who says I like you?

898
00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:50.000
Do you want to go
to dinner tonight?

899
00:39:52.233 --> 00:39:54.000
Dinner in what context?

900
00:39:54.133 --> 00:39:57.033
We order. we eat.
we talk hemlines.

901
00:39:57.166 --> 00:39:59.500
So this is a work thing?

902
00:39:59.633 --> 00:40:01.000
It's a friend thing.

903
00:40:03.867 --> 00:40:06.100
Yeah. Mm-hm.

904
00:40:06.233 --> 00:40:08.433
- Great.
- Okay.

905
00:40:16.133 --> 00:40:17.433
Ella:
This is really nice.

906
00:40:17.567 --> 00:40:21.000
Well. it's a thank you
for Annie Chew.

907
00:40:21.133 --> 00:40:22.934
I hope other designers
follow her lead.

908
00:40:23.066 --> 00:40:26.233
See I have to prove to my father
that the digital future

909
00:40:26.367 --> 00:40:28.200
is an opportunity to
reach more people.

910
00:40:28.333 --> 00:40:30.767
Maybe it's a good
thing you didn't become

911
00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:33.233
- a basketball player.
- Yeah.

912
00:40:33.367 --> 00:40:36.400
After college I rebelled.

913
00:40:36.533 --> 00:40:40.100
I got as far from my family
heritage as I knew how.

914
00:40:40.233 --> 00:40:41.100
And how did you do that?

915
00:40:41.233 --> 00:40:42.667
I travelled. Went to Spain.

916
00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:43.900
Fell in love with Spain.

917
00:40:44.033 --> 00:40:45.767
Have you ever been to Spain?

918
00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:48.233
I can barely afford
a ticket to Pittsburgh.

919
00:40:48.367 --> 00:40:51.600
You know. as soon as
Ella Originals takes off.

920
00:40:51.734 --> 00:40:53.033
Spain is the first
place I'll go.

921
00:40:53.166 --> 00:40:56.000
I didn't mean for
that to sound arrogant.

922
00:40:56.133 --> 00:40:58.000
I was just trying to
ask you a question.

923
00:40:58.133 --> 00:40:59.767
And I was answering a question.

924
00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:01.767
Okay. are we fighting
or flirting. I can't tell.

925
00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:02.867
Me neither.

926
00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.734
Okay. so. after sunny Spain.

927
00:41:07.867 --> 00:41:09.500
how did you get to
where you are now?

928
00:41:09.633 --> 00:41:12.600
Well. I realized I could
do things my own way.

929
00:41:12.734 --> 00:41:16.100
So. I got my MBA. I learned
the world of publishing.

930
00:41:16.233 --> 00:41:19.800
and to respect the reader
as much as the bottom line.

931
00:41:19.934 --> 00:41:21.900
Sounds like you have
a soapbox of your own.

932
00:41:22.033 --> 00:41:26.266
I think I'm just
trying to impress you.

933
00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.467
It's working.

934
00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:32.967
Is it the Bordeaux
or the company?

935
00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:34.667
I'm gonna go with the wine.

936
00:41:36.467 --> 00:41:41.100
But. you know.
the company is hard to resist.

937
00:41:46.734 --> 00:41:48.400
Where were you?

938
00:41:48.533 --> 00:41:50.834
I went to dinner with Derek.

939
00:41:50.967 --> 00:41:52.300
You went on a date?

940
00:41:52.433 --> 00:41:54.233
Not a date.
just talking and hanging out.

941
00:41:54.367 --> 00:41:55.500
Where did you go?

942
00:41:55.633 --> 00:41:57.400
Le Petit Jardin.

943
00:41:57.533 --> 00:41:58.633
It was a date.

944
00:41:58.767 --> 00:42:01.934
Whatever it was.
I had a wonderful time.

945
00:42:04.834 --> 00:42:06.200
He probably dates
a lot of women.

946
00:42:06.333 --> 00:42:10.967
models and socialites.
I'm just a novelty.

947
00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:13.166
And this article is
way too important.

948
00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:14.967
it could change my career.

949
00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:17.367
I'm not going to ruin
that with some flirtation.

950
00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:20.500
Are you buying any of that?
Because I'm not.

951
00:42:20.633 --> 00:42:22.233
Okay. I really like him.

952
00:42:22.367 --> 00:42:24.133
and a lot more
than I bargained for.

953
00:42:26.166 --> 00:42:28.066
You don't want to get hurt.

954
00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:29.166
Exactly.

955
00:42:42.834 --> 00:42:43.967
All this stuff is great.

956
00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:45.233
Who is that?

957
00:42:45.367 --> 00:42:47.033
Oh. that's Candice Huffine.

958
00:42:47.166 --> 00:42:51.400
The most amazing
full-figured model in the world.

959
00:42:51.533 --> 00:42:53.900
And also my muse.

960
00:42:54.033 --> 00:42:55.967
This is really pretty.

961
00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:59.967
Thank you. I can make it
in a smaller size if you'd like.

962
00:43:00.166 --> 00:43:01.633
Are they for sale?

963
00:43:01.767 --> 00:43:04.033
Yeah. for sure. Right here
in my little boutique.

964
00:43:04.166 --> 00:43:05.700
Annie Chew used to sell
her designs out of a loft.

965
00:43:05.834 --> 00:43:08.200
It's like a rite of passage.

966
00:43:08.333 --> 00:43:11.467
Musicians start in a garage.
and designers start in a loft.

967
00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:13.266
And where do you go from here?

968
00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:16.467
Maybe. someday. I'll have my own
showroom on Fashion Avenue.

969
00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:19.333
or I'll just keep
freelancing as a seamstress.

970
00:43:19.467 --> 00:43:22.533
Come on. You need to have
more faith in yourself.

971
00:43:22.667 --> 00:43:25.300
I'm still that kid
from Pittsburgh.

972
00:43:25.433 --> 00:43:27.100
I arrived in New York
and called myself a designer.

973
00:43:27.233 --> 00:43:29.467
And. you know. it can be really
scary when you dream that big.

974
00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:30.967
Dream as big as you want.

975
00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:33.667
you got the talent
to back it up.

976
00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:35.367
This place is terrific.

977
00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:37.133
It's really gonna
add to the story.

978
00:43:37.266 --> 00:43:39.533
100 years ago this building
was filled with sweatshops.

979
00:43:39.667 --> 00:43:41.433
All the immigrant
garment workers were

980
00:43:41.567 --> 00:43:44.100
from the Lower East Side.
It's hallowed ground.

981
00:43:44.233 --> 00:43:47.033
Let's-- Let's make sure
we include that. huh?

982
00:43:47.166 --> 00:43:48.934
You got it.

983
00:43:49.066 --> 00:43:51.100
You know. I thought I was doing
you a favour with this article.

984
00:43:51.233 --> 00:43:52.834
Turns out you're doing me one.

985
00:43:52.967 --> 00:43:54.767
You're going to be
a fantastic read.

986
00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:58.967
Is that publisher-speak
or do you really mean it?

987
00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:00.133
Every word.

988
00:44:08.166 --> 00:44:10.734
So. how's it--
How's it coming along?

989
00:44:10.867 --> 00:44:13.400
I think this piece on Ella
could be really special.

990
00:44:13.533 --> 00:44:16.600
Well. I think Ella is
really special.

991
00:44:16.734 --> 00:44:18.100
Stop me if
I'm crossing a line here.

992
00:44:18.233 --> 00:44:19.500
but are you two a thing?

993
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.667
Not the type of
thing I'm used to.

994
00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.600
Hm.

995
00:44:25.734 --> 00:44:27.200
I'm not sure what to call us.

996
00:44:27.333 --> 00:44:29.233
I'm getting the sense
she has some reservations.

997
00:44:29.367 --> 00:44:32.166
So. show her who you really are.

998
00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:33.333
The stuff that you're into.

999
00:44:36.367 --> 00:44:39.033
What if she's disappointed
by the man I turn out to be?

1000
00:44:39.166 --> 00:44:40.934
At least you'll know
it's not your money

1001
00:44:41.066 --> 00:44:42.667
and good looks
that are the problem.

1002
00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:45.233
Stop it.

1003
00:44:45.367 --> 00:44:47.500
So. what's the surprise?
Where are you taking us?

1004
00:44:47.633 --> 00:44:48.767
You'll see. We're almost there.

1005
00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:50.533
- Almost where?
- I don't know!

1006
00:44:50.667 --> 00:44:51.600
Tell me.

1007
00:44:51.734 --> 00:44:53.033
Alright.
I'm taking you to a gym.

1008
00:44:53.166 --> 00:44:54.567
You're taking me to
a gym in Brooklyn?

1009
00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:56.033
Mm-hm. Surprise!

1010
00:44:56.166 --> 00:44:57.567
Big surprise.

1011
00:44:57.700 --> 00:44:59.166
I may be over-dressed.

1012
00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:00.967
No. you are perfect.

1013
00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:02.600
It's right here.

1014
00:45:02.734 --> 00:45:05.233
It's like reaching for
a cookie on top of a shelf.

1015
00:45:05.367 --> 00:45:07.266
Okay. up and curve.

1016
00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:11.467
Just like this.

1017
00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.967
Alright? Alright.

1018
00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:15.834
So. just like that
I want you to try a few shots.

1019
00:45:18.033 --> 00:45:20.367
Ah. nice try.

1020
00:45:22.066 --> 00:45:23.834
Okay. so. I think
what the problem is. is--

1021
00:45:23.967 --> 00:45:25.967
Hey. Hi.
Bend your knees a little.

1022
00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:28.633
It's kind of a spectator thing--

1023
00:45:28.767 --> 00:45:30.433
I'm on Eddie's team.

1024
00:45:30.567 --> 00:45:32.166
Alright.

1025
00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:35.000
Hi. Alright. so. I used to play
basketball with my brother.

1026
00:45:35.133 --> 00:45:36.767
and he was a point guard
in high school. alright?

1027
00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:41.600
So. why don't you try to loosen
your grip before you release

1028
00:45:41.734 --> 00:45:43.934
and give it more arc. Yeah?

1029
00:45:44.066 --> 00:45:47.266
Relax and follow-through
on your release.

1030
00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:52.500
- Go. Eddie!
- Oh!

1031
00:45:52.633 --> 00:45:53.500
Good work.

1032
00:45:53.633 --> 00:45:54.633
Thanks.

1033
00:45:54.767 --> 00:45:56.166
Go. Ella.

1034
00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:57.934
See? You can do it.

1035
00:45:58.066 --> 00:45:59.333
Eddie:
Yeah. I can.

1036
00:45:59.467 --> 00:46:01.500
That's a happy man.

1037
00:46:01.633 --> 00:46:03.633
Must be the company
he's keeping.

1038
00:46:03.767 --> 00:46:04.667
This is how you play.

1039
00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:07.033
I take a shot. if I get it in.

1040
00:46:07.166 --> 00:46:11.500
you have to duplicate.
if you miss. you get an H.

1041
00:46:11.633 --> 00:46:13.967
And when you miss
you get another letter.

1042
00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:15.500
I have been playing
Horse with my brother

1043
00:46:15.633 --> 00:46:17.467
since I was six-years old.

1044
00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:19.500
You. sir. are going down.

1045
00:46:19.633 --> 00:46:21.734
Oh. It is on.

1046
00:46:21.867 --> 00:46:22.834
Okay.

1047
00:46:27.967 --> 00:46:29.166
Does this hurt?

1048
00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:31.000
No. I think I just twisted it.

1049
00:46:31.133 --> 00:46:32.467
Does this hurt?

1050
00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:35.367
Ow! Oh. gosh.
Yeah. why would you do that?

1051
00:46:36.533 --> 00:46:37.700
Stupid.

1052
00:46:37.834 --> 00:46:38.900
I think it's
my pride that's hurt.

1053
00:46:39.033 --> 00:46:40.033
Here you go.

1054
00:46:40.166 --> 00:46:41.800
Thank you. Harry.

1055
00:46:41.934 --> 00:46:43.233
Thank you very much.

1056
00:46:45.266 --> 00:46:48.000
You know. you're not
who I thought you were.

1057
00:46:48.133 --> 00:46:52.400
Yeah? Is that a good thing

1058
00:46:52.533 --> 00:46:53.800
or a bad thing?

1059
00:46:53.934 --> 00:46:55.633
It's good.

1060
00:46:55.767 --> 00:46:58.333
Word of advice. though.

1061
00:46:58.467 --> 00:47:00.700
Next time. wear high-tops.

1062
00:47:00.834 --> 00:47:03.100
Thanks for the fashion tip.

1063
00:47:03.233 --> 00:47:05.867
It's not a fashion tip.

1064
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.200
It's common sense.

1065
00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:10.400
How's your ankle?

1066
00:47:10.533 --> 00:47:11.734
Much better.
Thank you.

1067
00:47:11.867 --> 00:47:13.433
It might be sore
for a while.

1068
00:47:13.567 --> 00:47:14.533
- Oh. yeah?
- Mm-hm.

1069
00:47:16.767 --> 00:47:18.467
Were you close to
your family growing up?

1070
00:47:19.834 --> 00:47:21.467
Colby's doesn't do close.

1071
00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:23.266
We do what's expected.

1072
00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:25.934
See. my father grew up in
the very long shadow of

1073
00:47:26.066 --> 00:47:30.867
my grandfather. and I am
expected to do the same.

1074
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.600
But he's still your father.

1075
00:47:32.734 --> 00:47:33.600
Yeah.

1076
00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:36.467
My father was everything to me.

1077
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.533
I miss him every day.

1078
00:47:39.667 --> 00:47:41.400
You should find a way to
make some good memories

1079
00:47:41.533 --> 00:47:43.367
while you still can.

1080
00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:44.367
Yeah.

1081
00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:45.767
I have a lot of opinions.

1082
00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:47.300
I've noticed. yeah.

1083
00:47:47.433 --> 00:47:49.800
Walk me home at your own risk.
This is me.

1084
00:47:52.233 --> 00:47:54.133
I should get inside.

1085
00:47:54.266 --> 00:47:57.133
I have a sewing gig
in the morning.

1086
00:47:57.266 --> 00:48:01.133
You need to commit
to being a designer.

1087
00:48:01.266 --> 00:48:03.133
And it's not just about
the way other people see you.

1088
00:48:03.266 --> 00:48:07.266
it's how you see yourself.

1089
00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:10.033
Yeah. well. I'm not
ready to make that leap.

1090
00:48:10.166 --> 00:48:11.600
Maybe after
the article comes out

1091
00:48:11.734 --> 00:48:14.700
I'll have more confidence.

1092
00:48:14.834 --> 00:48:16.600
or maybe people
won't like my designs

1093
00:48:16.734 --> 00:48:18.600
and I'll just be
sewing seams forever.

1094
00:48:20.133 --> 00:48:21.700
Welcome to
the inside of my head.

1095
00:48:21.834 --> 00:48:24.333
It's my favourite place to be.

1096
00:48:24.467 --> 00:48:26.400
You're in there a lot.

1097
00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:29.767
Am I?

1098
00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:38.967
I'm sorry. I--

1099
00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:41.300
No. just. um...

1100
00:48:41.433 --> 00:48:42.867
This is happening really fast.

1101
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.500
Yup.

1102
00:48:44.633 --> 00:48:46.967
- I mean. it feels that way.
- No. it didn't mean--

1103
00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:48.200
It's-- I mean-- I just--

1104
00:48:48.333 --> 00:48:50.266
I need time to get my bearings.

1105
00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:54.433
Sure. yeah.

1106
00:48:54.567 --> 00:48:55.567
As much as you need.

1107
00:48:59.133 --> 00:49:02.367
It might help if you were
a little less wonderful.

1108
00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:03.467
I'll work on that.

1109
00:49:05.467 --> 00:49:06.433
Thank you.

1110
00:49:10.967 --> 00:49:12.166
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1111
00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:28.734
What are you up to?

1112
00:49:30.633 --> 00:49:32.900
This dress is to
wear to the party.

1113
00:49:33.033 --> 00:49:35.333
I want it to be perfect. magical.

1114
00:49:35.467 --> 00:49:38.767
Max gave me the remnants
of this gorgeous silk.

1115
00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:40.100
Oh. I love the colour.

1116
00:49:40.233 --> 00:49:42.333
I know.
It's called Fairytale Blue.

1117
00:49:42.467 --> 00:49:44.667
The Prince is gonna love it.

1118
00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:46.567
This is not about him.

1119
00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:49.567
This is about me holding
my own at that party.

1120
00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:51.667
I'm going to be surrounded
by the most important people

1121
00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:54.900
in fashion.
people I want to impress.

1122
00:49:55.033 --> 00:49:57.500
I get to be
one of the designers.

1123
00:49:57.633 --> 00:49:58.734
Well. you're gonna
knock it out of the park.

1124
00:49:58.867 --> 00:50:01.233
the ballroom or wherever.

1125
00:50:01.367 --> 00:50:03.967
Get some glass slippers
to go with the dress.

1126
00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:07.367
Mm! Yeah! Yes.

1127
00:50:10.033 --> 00:50:11.467
I want to coordinate
the photos of the loft

1128
00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:13.633
and the Lower East Side
neighbourhood with your article.

1129
00:50:13.767 --> 00:50:16.600
What pictures. what article?

1130
00:50:16.734 --> 00:50:19.166
I'm writing a piece about
Ella for the digital magazine.

1131
00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:21.100
On whose authority?

1132
00:50:21.233 --> 00:50:24.100
On Derek's authority.
and on mine.

1133
00:50:24.233 --> 00:50:27.767
And what is it about Ella that
the readers are dying to know?

1134
00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:29.767
That she is designing
beautiful clothes the fit

1135
00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:31.900
the full-figured women that
The Look has been ignoring

1136
00:50:32.033 --> 00:50:33.266
for 50 years.

1137
00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:34.767
Well said.

1138
00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:38.066
I doubt very much
that Claudia would agree.

1139
00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:48.266
Jasmine would be an absolute
vision in that outfit

1140
00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:50.900
if she were wearing
the necklace I selected.

1141
00:50:51.033 --> 00:50:52.467
If I could have a quick word?

1142
00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:53.734
It's important.

1143
00:50:53.867 --> 00:50:55.734
Nothing is more
important than The Book.

1144
00:50:55.867 --> 00:50:57.567
It's about
the future of the magazine

1145
00:50:57.700 --> 00:50:59.233
and the direction it's taking.

1146
00:51:01.367 --> 00:51:03.734
Unfurrow your brow
and cut to the chase.

1147
00:51:03.867 --> 00:51:07.400
I'm talking about Derek's plans
for the digital magazine.

1148
00:51:07.533 --> 00:51:09.166
It's a big departure
from the usual content.

1149
00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:12.033
and by "big" I mean wider.

1150
00:51:12.166 --> 00:51:14.133
And by "wider"
I mean full-figured.

1151
00:51:14.266 --> 00:51:15.934
He's doing a story about Ella.

1152
00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:19.467
That nobody from
the fashion shoot?

1153
00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:20.734
I don't know
what she's telling him.

1154
00:51:20.867 --> 00:51:23.467
but Derek seems to be listening.

1155
00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:28.133
Well. then his father
better start listening to me.

1156
00:51:28.266 --> 00:51:30.700
My name is
synonymous with this brand

1157
00:51:30.834 --> 00:51:32.633
and I will not be ignored.

1158
00:51:38.834 --> 00:51:41.333
Great. Claudia called
my father to complain.

1159
00:51:41.467 --> 00:51:43.467
and now we have
a meeting to discuss

1160
00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:47.700
the questionable decision to
give plus-size so much space.

1161
00:51:47.834 --> 00:51:49.800
And how much space does
she think the majority

1162
00:51:49.934 --> 00:51:51.800
of American women deserve?

1163
00:51:51.934 --> 00:51:54.000
We could hold the editorial

1164
00:51:54.133 --> 00:51:56.233
on body positivity
for a few months.

1165
00:51:56.367 --> 00:51:59.066
Body positivity isn't
just some trendy phrase.

1166
00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:01.400
It's changing lives.

1167
00:52:01.533 --> 00:52:03.367
Knowing that you're valued
for who you are.

1168
00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:05.800
any size. any shape.

1169
00:52:05.934 --> 00:52:08.133
Don't let anyone take that away.

1170
00:52:14.567 --> 00:52:16.734
In order
to increase revenue.

1171
00:52:16.867 --> 00:52:20.100
we have to appeal
to a broader base.

1172
00:52:20.233 --> 00:52:22.567
Well. they're certainly broader.
I'll grant you that.

1173
00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:24.066
Oh. come on.

1174
00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:26.700
But not the type
to buy The Look.

1175
00:52:26.834 --> 00:52:29.567
Perhaps if The Look
weren't so condescendingly

1176
00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:31.900
narrow in scope they would.

1177
00:52:32.033 --> 00:52:34.367
Who is putting all this
nonsense in your head?

1178
00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:37.400
I am vehemently opposed to some

1179
00:52:37.533 --> 00:52:39.700
everywoman idea of fashion.

1180
00:52:39.834 --> 00:52:42.934
It should be aspirational.

1181
00:52:43.066 --> 00:52:44.734
Beautiful women
we all want to be.

1182
00:52:44.867 --> 00:52:46.633
wearing beautiful clothing!

1183
00:52:46.767 --> 00:52:49.200
And isn't that how
every woman wants to feel?

1184
00:52:51.266 --> 00:52:53.066
I mean. I'm not setting
limitations on who's allowed

1185
00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:55.400
to dream when
they read our magazine.

1186
00:52:55.533 --> 00:52:57.900
I'm sorry. Claudia.
but I'm not changing my mind.

1187
00:53:02.066 --> 00:53:03.767
Does he still speak for you?

1188
00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:07.400
Assuming he turns
out to be right.

1189
00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:12.867
Well. we stick with what we got.

1190
00:53:17.333 --> 00:53:19.367
On behalf of a whole
lot of women. thank you.

1191
00:53:23.233 --> 00:53:25.800
Father. you remember Ella.

1192
00:53:25.934 --> 00:53:27.834
Hello. again.

1193
00:53:27.967 --> 00:53:30.767
This is how you make
critical business decisions?

1194
00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:32.934
On the advice of
a momentary fling?

1195
00:53:33.066 --> 00:53:37.266
It isn't momentary
and it's not a fling.

1196
00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:38.667
We're working together.

1197
00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:40.233
Very closely. it appears.

1198
00:53:42.333 --> 00:53:43.300
Filling my shoes
isn't automatic.

1199
00:53:43.433 --> 00:53:44.800
it has to be earned.

1200
00:53:44.934 --> 00:53:46.200
Well. if this is going to work.

1201
00:53:46.333 --> 00:53:49.000
I have be able to
do things my own way.

1202
00:53:49.133 --> 00:53:50.767
Not if it means
risking the company

1203
00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:52.500
that defines
our family name.

1204
00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:10.233
Mr. Colby?

1205
00:54:10.367 --> 00:54:12.600
I may be overstepping.

1206
00:54:12.734 --> 00:54:16.734
but I think your son is trying

1207
00:54:16.867 --> 00:54:20.200
to do some good with
the opportunity you gave him.

1208
00:54:20.333 --> 00:54:21.667
He has some pretty great
ideas of what the future

1209
00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:23.567
could look like.

1210
00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:25.734
Give him the chance
to make you proud.

1211
00:54:25.867 --> 00:54:29.500
Are you always this bold?

1212
00:54:29.633 --> 00:54:30.934
Only when I know I'm right.

1213
00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:34.500
He needs you to believe in him.

1214
00:54:38.567 --> 00:54:42.166
Point well-taken.
And well-delivered.

1215
00:54:54.867 --> 00:54:59.266
Not too shabby.
as penthouses go.

1216
00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:02.100
But he's moving to Brooklyn.
so he's forgiven.

1217
00:55:02.233 --> 00:55:05.834
Yes. I am making my daring
escape from the Upper East Side.

1218
00:55:05.967 --> 00:55:07.433
It's about time.

1219
00:55:07.567 --> 00:55:11.300
So. the secret to a good
Bolognese sauce is the pancetta.

1220
00:55:11.433 --> 00:55:15.233
The more pancetta the merrier.
I always say.

1221
00:55:15.367 --> 00:55:16.433
- Oh. yeah?
- Mm-hm.

1222
00:55:16.567 --> 00:55:17.600
- You always say that?
- Yup.

1223
00:55:17.734 --> 00:55:19.233
Who do you say it to?

1224
00:55:19.367 --> 00:55:22.734
Mostly to myself.
it doesn't really come up a lot.

1225
00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:27.166
So. I gather you like to cook.

1226
00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:29.900
Yeah. you know.
it's kind of a hobby of mine.

1227
00:55:30.033 --> 00:55:32.266
Pretty sure you learned
that at your last publication.

1228
00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.533
Okay. Oscar.
that's enough out of you.

1229
00:55:36.233 --> 00:55:38.033
Now. for the real test.

1230
00:55:39.066 --> 00:55:40.033
Okay.

1231
00:55:42.867 --> 00:55:44.567
What do you think?

1232
00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:46.333
More wine?

1233
00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:52.333
I think you should
leave sensational alone.

1234
00:55:52.467 --> 00:55:55.834
Hm.

1235
00:55:55.967 --> 00:55:59.567
I like working here.
better food. better view.

1236
00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:03.200
Away from Claudia and her spies.

1237
00:56:03.333 --> 00:56:04.667
Yeah. well.
we go live in nine days.

1238
00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:07.333
so Claudia's views
will be a moot point.

1239
00:56:07.467 --> 00:56:09.934
I'm sure she'll find a way
to un-moot her point.

1240
00:56:12.967 --> 00:56:15.300
So. you play that piano?

1241
00:56:15.433 --> 00:56:17.233
Yeah. yeah. A little bit.

1242
00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:21.500
I'm gonna head home.

1243
00:56:21.633 --> 00:56:22.867
I will see you two tomorrow.

1244
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.500
Alright. have a good night.

1245
00:56:24.633 --> 00:56:25.667
You too.

1246
00:56:27.867 --> 00:56:30.900
Alright. Colby.
Let's see what you got.

1247
00:56:33.533 --> 00:56:36.967
Alright. but I'm not
looking for an opinion.

1248
00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:47.033
Any requests?

1249
00:56:47.166 --> 00:56:49.033
Your piano. your call.

1250
00:56:49.166 --> 00:56:50.133
Okay.

1251
00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:23.800
Is there anything
you can't do?

1252
00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:28.233
I can't sew.

1253
00:57:28.367 --> 00:57:29.333
Good.

1254
00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:32.800
I can't skate.

1255
00:57:32.934 --> 00:57:34.500
Yeah. that makes the two of us.

1256
00:57:35.867 --> 00:57:37.266
I can't walk in heels.

1257
00:57:42.533 --> 00:57:44.700
I thought we agreed
you'd be less wonderful.

1258
00:57:48.567 --> 00:57:50.400
Sorry.

1259
00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:14.900
It's only a dress.
No lives are at stake.

1260
00:58:15.033 --> 00:58:16.900
Do you know how many silkworms
on how many mulberry leaves

1261
00:58:17.033 --> 00:58:18.700
it took to make
this fabric?

1262
00:58:18.834 --> 00:58:20.133
Ugh. TMI.

1263
00:58:20.266 --> 00:58:22.700
I prefer to think
that silk just happens.

1264
00:58:22.834 --> 00:58:26.000
no creepy crawly
critters are involved.

1265
00:58:26.133 --> 00:58:27.400
Liza is coming in
late today.

1266
00:58:27.533 --> 00:58:31.300
She is so obsessed
with this party.

1267
00:58:31.433 --> 00:58:33.367
I bet she's having something
done before the big event.

1268
00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:35.500
Like what?

1269
00:58:35.633 --> 00:58:37.633
The red-carpet special. Ella.

1270
00:58:37.767 --> 00:58:38.967
What's that?

1271
00:58:45.934 --> 00:58:47.567
Have you seen Katie?

1272
00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:49.266
No. She's somewhere
around here.

1273
00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:52.467
What are you looking at?

1274
00:58:53.667 --> 00:58:55.100
What do you mean?

1275
00:58:56.867 --> 00:58:58.266
I have a staff meeting.

1276
00:59:02.367 --> 00:59:04.700
I had a lunch-time
touch-up.

1277
00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:07.900
Are you judging me?

1278
00:59:08.033 --> 00:59:11.433
I'm not judging.
I'm nodding.

1279
00:59:11.567 --> 00:59:13.734
It's not easy being
surrounded by all these models.

1280
00:59:13.867 --> 00:59:17.700
Always feeling like
the before instead of the after.

1281
00:59:17.834 --> 00:59:18.800
A little filler helps.

1282
00:59:18.934 --> 00:59:20.734
I get it.

1283
00:59:20.867 --> 00:59:22.567
No. you don't.

1284
00:59:24.567 --> 00:59:27.367
Trust me. I do.

1285
00:59:37.667 --> 00:59:39.066
Katie:
The article is almost done.

1286
00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:42.100
but it's hard to
capture Ella in 500 words.

1287
00:59:42.233 --> 00:59:46.533
Well. how about smart.
funny. talented. to name a few.

1288
00:59:46.667 --> 00:59:48.567
I couldn't agree more.

1289
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.800
You've gotta keep the immigrant
garment workers who lived

1290
00:59:53.934 --> 00:59:56.433
in the building.
it gives the story gravitas.

1291
00:59:56.567 --> 00:59:58.700
Gravitas coming right up.

1292
00:59:58.834 --> 01:00:00.200
You want to get a bite to eat?

1293
01:00:00.333 --> 01:00:01.934
I have to get
back to The Closet.

1294
01:00:02.066 --> 01:00:03.467
Liza wants me to
pull some dresses for her

1295
01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.467
to wear to the party.

1296
01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.200
And what are you
going to wear?

1297
01:00:06.333 --> 01:00:07.967
Where?

1298
01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:09.300
To the party.

1299
01:00:09.433 --> 01:00:10.800
You could be my plus one.

1300
01:00:12.867 --> 01:00:16.367
Oh. I guess I'm going
to a party.

1301
01:00:17.934 --> 01:00:20.033
Just bring some
advertisers with you. please.

1302
01:00:20.166 --> 01:00:22.133
It's not that bad.

1303
01:00:22.266 --> 01:00:23.400
Oh. it is.
People still see us as

1304
01:00:23.533 --> 01:00:25.633
a sidecar to the print magazine.

1305
01:00:25.767 --> 01:00:28.066
We need this party to
generate some major buzz

1306
01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:29.900
before we publish. okay?

1307
01:00:31.734 --> 01:00:34.900
Is Claudia on
her broomstick again?

1308
01:00:35.033 --> 01:00:36.734
No. it's currently parked.

1309
01:00:36.867 --> 01:00:39.867
Just the usual woes of
trying to turn a profit.

1310
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.934
Wanna go get lunch?
I'm buying.

1311
01:00:43.066 --> 01:00:44.467
Oh. I would love to.

1312
01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:48.300
it's just I have
a meeting with an ad agency.

1313
01:00:48.433 --> 01:00:50.900
Oh. well. in that case.
go get 'em.

1314
01:00:51.033 --> 01:00:53.033
Another time?

1315
01:00:53.166 --> 01:00:54.900
Any other time?

1316
01:00:55.033 --> 01:00:56.066
You're on.

1317
01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:57.166
Okay.

1318
01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:06.133
Sometimes I feel like
he's too good to be true.

1319
01:01:06.266 --> 01:01:07.367
What's a girl supposed to do

1320
01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:09.166
when subjected
to all that charm?

1321
01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:11.800
I think he's into you.
and you're obviously into him.

1322
01:01:11.934 --> 01:01:14.500
I was hoping
it wasn't that obvious.

1323
01:01:14.633 --> 01:01:15.767
You've had
serious boyfriends before.

1324
01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:17.667
why is this throwing you
for such a loop?

1325
01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:21.100
Peter was great on paper.
but he never made me laugh.

1326
01:01:21.233 --> 01:01:22.800
and Jason and I
almost got married.

1327
01:01:22.934 --> 01:01:25.500
but. you know. deep down.
I knew he wasn't the one.

1328
01:01:25.633 --> 01:01:29.300
I don't know. they were both
reasonable choices.

1329
01:01:29.433 --> 01:01:32.800
the 7th most eligible bachelor
in New York. not so much.

1330
01:01:32.934 --> 01:01:35.367
Try not to run away
before you find out.

1331
01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:37.667
I hate that you know me so well.

1332
01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:41.867
I have to go to bed. I have
such an early morning tomorrow.

1333
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.467
Almost finished.

1334
01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.367
What do you think?

1335
01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:47.033
It is even more magical
than the sketch.

1336
01:01:47.166 --> 01:01:48.767
It's very Cinderella.

1337
01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:50.834
I used to love Cinderella
when I was a kid.

1338
01:01:50.967 --> 01:01:55.333
I read all the storybooks.
saw all the movies.

1339
01:01:55.467 --> 01:01:57.967
but Cinderella
never looked like me.

1340
01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:03.100
There are a lot of little
girls feeling what I felt.

1341
01:02:03.233 --> 01:02:04.734
I kind of want to change that.

1342
01:02:04.867 --> 01:02:07.266
Yet another pearl of wisdom
that I have to now

1343
01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:09.533
jam into this article.

1344
01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:14.433
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1345
01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:18.000
Alright.
what do you got?

1346
01:02:19.834 --> 01:02:22.800
No. No.
Doesn't work.

1347
01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:39.333
Another RSVP.

1348
01:02:39.467 --> 01:02:42.266
I am not happy about this party.

1349
01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:45.533
Derek is trying to
stand in my spotlight.

1350
01:02:45.667 --> 01:02:48.233
The guest list needs to
include all of the designers

1351
01:02:48.367 --> 01:02:51.233
and VIPs that are loyal to me.

1352
01:02:51.367 --> 01:02:53.033
Of course.

1353
01:02:53.166 --> 01:02:56.767
And invite Jasmine and some of
the models from the print issue.

1354
01:02:56.900 --> 01:03:00.066
they know how
to steal the focus.

1355
01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:02.433
Liza:
The list is getting pretty long.

1356
01:03:02.567 --> 01:03:03.767
I have all
the would-be advertisers

1357
01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:05.100
that Derek is courting.

1358
01:03:05.233 --> 01:03:07.433
Annie Chew
and her team are coming.

1359
01:03:07.567 --> 01:03:10.133
the RSVPs are pouring in.

1360
01:03:10.266 --> 01:03:11.800
What about Ella?

1361
01:03:11.934 --> 01:03:13.667
Well. she's been working
with Derek so I just assumed.

1362
01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:15.333
Well. make an excuse.

1363
01:03:15.467 --> 01:03:19.767
I mean. we're overbooked
and you had to make some cuts.

1364
01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:24.100
I don't want her whispering
in his ear all night long.

1365
01:03:24.233 --> 01:03:27.166
I want you whispering
in his ear.

1366
01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:29.367
Only the things
you want him to hear.

1367
01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:36.700
Ella. do you have a minute?

1368
01:03:38.266 --> 01:03:39.433
Sure.

1369
01:03:39.567 --> 01:03:41.633
This is a little awkward.

1370
01:03:41.767 --> 01:03:44.500
What is it?

1371
01:03:44.633 --> 01:03:45.934
It's about the party.

1372
01:03:46.066 --> 01:03:49.100
I have to invite all
these high-profile VIPs.

1373
01:03:49.233 --> 01:03:52.166
Unfortunately. we had to make
some cuts in the guest list.

1374
01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:55.066
Are you telling me
I'm not invited?

1375
01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:58.800
I'm sorry. Ella.
but I had no choice.

1376
01:03:58.934 --> 01:04:00.533
The point of the party
is to get press.

1377
01:04:00.667 --> 01:04:03.400
Derek has so much
riding on this.

1378
01:04:03.533 --> 01:04:05.834
You're a sewer
who's trying to make her mark.

1379
01:04:05.967 --> 01:04:09.533
and I respect that.
but he needs the place to be

1380
01:04:09.667 --> 01:04:12.333
packed with established
designers who can buy ads.

1381
01:04:14.767 --> 01:04:16.367
I hope you understand.

1382
01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:18.567
I understand.

1383
01:04:23.166 --> 01:04:24.800
Ella didn't want me
to say anything to Derek.

1384
01:04:24.934 --> 01:04:27.700
so I'm saying it to you.
this stinks!

1385
01:04:27.834 --> 01:04:29.967
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1386
01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:32.200
Liza took Ella off
the guest list for the party

1387
01:04:32.333 --> 01:04:34.200
because it was VIP only.

1388
01:04:34.333 --> 01:04:35.500
Just how important
does a person need to be

1389
01:04:35.633 --> 01:04:37.066
to get into this thing?!

1390
01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:39.166
Nobody's more important
to this relaunch than Ella.

1391
01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:41.300
Well. she certainly
isn't feeling that way.

1392
01:04:41.433 --> 01:04:43.467
Let me talk to Derek.

1393
01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:46.333
Liza made it sound like
she was doing this for him.

1394
01:04:46.467 --> 01:04:47.400
Are you sure he didn't know?

1395
01:04:47.533 --> 01:04:49.667
Not if he's who I think he is.

1396
01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:55.800
Hey. Liza.

1397
01:04:55.934 --> 01:04:58.133
Can I talk to you for a second?

1398
01:04:58.266 --> 01:04:59.500
Of course. Derek. Hi.

1399
01:04:59.633 --> 01:05:01.633
Hi. Listen. I just--

1400
01:05:01.767 --> 01:05:03.633
I just wanted to thank you
for all your hard work

1401
01:05:03.767 --> 01:05:05.200
that you've been
doing with the party.

1402
01:05:05.333 --> 01:05:07.700
That means so much
coming from you.

1403
01:05:07.834 --> 01:05:10.700
There's a problem. though.
and I need you to fix it.

1404
01:05:10.834 --> 01:05:12.567
Whatever you need.

1405
01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:14.700
Put Ella's name back
on the guest list.

1406
01:05:14.834 --> 01:05:18.433
I don't know what she told you.
but I didn't have a choice.

1407
01:05:18.567 --> 01:05:21.867
Ella didn't
tell me anything. okay?

1408
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.033
This is me
telling you what I want.

1409
01:05:25.166 --> 01:05:28.300
Claudia wanted
all her regulars there

1410
01:05:28.433 --> 01:05:30.100
so she wouldn't be sidelined.

1411
01:05:30.233 --> 01:05:32.700
I like Ella. but she means
nothing to Claudia.

1412
01:05:32.834 --> 01:05:34.967
so she made me cut her.

1413
01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:37.667
I was in a bind.
Claudia is my boss.

1414
01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:43.033
And I'm her boss. okay?

1415
01:05:43.166 --> 01:05:45.533
So. I want you to put
Ella Richard's name

1416
01:05:45.667 --> 01:05:46.734
back on the list.

1417
01:05:48.767 --> 01:05:49.700
Of course.

1418
01:05:49.834 --> 01:05:51.200
Great.

1419
01:05:51.333 --> 01:05:53.033
Thank you. Liza.

1420
01:05:53.166 --> 01:05:54.133
No problem.

1421
01:06:05.834 --> 01:06:06.700
Hi.

1422
01:06:06.834 --> 01:06:08.266
Hey.

1423
01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:09.367
Look. signals got crossed.

1424
01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:10.433
alright. it was a mistake.

1425
01:06:10.567 --> 01:06:11.533
Of course you're invited.

1426
01:06:11.667 --> 01:06:14.467
Are you sure?

1427
01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:17.800
Yes. So sure I don't
even have the words.

1428
01:06:17.934 --> 01:06:20.700
Well. that was
a pretty good start.

1429
01:06:20.834 --> 01:06:22.767
Why don't you say a little more?

1430
01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:27.433
Okay. uh. how about

1431
01:06:27.567 --> 01:06:29.433
it wouldn't be
the same without you.

1432
01:06:29.567 --> 01:06:32.467
That works.

1433
01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:35.166
So I'll see you there?

1434
01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:36.200
Yes. you will.

1435
01:06:49.834 --> 01:06:51.400
Nice glass slippers.

1436
01:06:51.533 --> 01:06:53.266
Yeah. well. these shoes
were not made for walking.

1437
01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:55.367
just standing around.

1438
01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:56.900
I love your hair like that.

1439
01:06:57.033 --> 01:06:58.734
Thank you.
Just a casual do that took

1440
01:06:58.867 --> 01:07:00.333
longer to perfect
than the dress.

1441
01:07:00.467 --> 01:07:01.900
Okay. so what do you think?

1442
01:07:02.033 --> 01:07:03.834
I was worried these
would be too girly.

1443
01:07:03.967 --> 01:07:05.266
Girly and boring.

1444
01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:07.100
Wow. um. don't hold back.

1445
01:07:07.233 --> 01:07:10.000
Tell me how you really feel.

1446
01:07:10.133 --> 01:07:11.934
I bought these
at an estate sale.

1447
01:07:12.066 --> 01:07:13.834
I was saving them
for a special occasion

1448
01:07:13.967 --> 01:07:18.500
and just the right dress.

1449
01:07:18.633 --> 01:07:20.100
They're perfect.

1450
01:07:20.233 --> 01:07:22.000
You got yourself one
very handy Fairy Godmother.

1451
01:07:22.133 --> 01:07:23.166
Thanks.

1452
01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:30.500
Okay. I better get dressed.
we don't want to be late.

1453
01:07:30.633 --> 01:07:32.233
I'll go turn
a pumpkin into an Uber

1454
01:07:32.367 --> 01:07:33.834
and we will head for the ball.

1455
01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:46.834
Good evening. everyone.

1456
01:07:46.967 --> 01:07:49.800
What a wonderful way
to kick off Fashion Week.

1457
01:07:49.934 --> 01:07:51.934
Thank you all
so much for coming.

1458
01:07:52.066 --> 01:07:53.000
Aren't these ladies lovely?

1459
01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:59.000
Oh. Derek. Please. Come on.

1460
01:07:59.133 --> 01:08:00.700
Oh. Claudia.
it's not a great time.

1461
01:08:00.834 --> 01:08:02.066
- I was just--
- Photo op!

1462
01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:03.500
Okay.

1463
01:08:03.633 --> 01:08:05.633
Jasmine. how are you?

1464
01:08:05.767 --> 01:08:06.667
Good.

1465
01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:08.033
Thank you for coming.

1466
01:08:08.166 --> 01:08:09.333
Alright. we'll make this quick.

1467
01:08:13.667 --> 01:08:14.667
Derek! Derek!

1468
01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:17.000
Yes. Jeremy. Hey! How ya doing?

1469
01:08:17.133 --> 01:08:18.033
Why all the fanfare. Derek?

1470
01:08:18.166 --> 01:08:19.400
That's a great question. Joey.

1471
01:08:19.533 --> 01:08:21.967
The Look is getting
a new look online.

1472
01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:23.867
and I want to make sure
the fashion industry

1473
01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.333
knows what's coming.

1474
01:08:26.467 --> 01:08:29.233
Hey. hey. Nice to meet you.

1475
01:08:29.367 --> 01:08:31.633
Hope you got your check book.

1476
01:08:31.767 --> 01:08:34.133
Everything is going digital.
including fashion.

1477
01:08:34.266 --> 01:08:36.600
Legacy magazines like The Look
need to bend with the times.

1478
01:08:41.867 --> 01:08:43.767
Gentlemen. if you'll excuse me?

1479
01:08:51.667 --> 01:08:53.700
Wow.

1480
01:08:53.834 --> 01:08:55.900
You look beautiful.

1481
01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.166
You clean up
pretty well yourself.

1482
01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:01.033
I'm so glad you're here.

1483
01:09:04.934 --> 01:09:09.133
Ella. what a nice surprise.

1484
01:09:09.266 --> 01:09:11.533
That dress is everything!

1485
01:09:11.667 --> 01:09:13.033
Well. hearing you
say that is everything.

1486
01:09:14.433 --> 01:09:15.934
I'm a big fan of Ella's work.

1487
01:09:16.066 --> 01:09:17.967
Is that right?

1488
01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:20.633
Well. we're doing a story about
Ella as an undiscovered talent.

1489
01:09:20.767 --> 01:09:24.033
I would love it if
you could give us a few quotes.

1490
01:09:24.166 --> 01:09:26.066
All you need.

1491
01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:28.367
That's-- Thank you.

1492
01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:31.200
Oh. of course. You deserve it.

1493
01:09:31.333 --> 01:09:33.934
Great.

1494
01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:44.033
There you are.
You look amazing.

1495
01:09:44.166 --> 01:09:46.133
That dress is perfect.

1496
01:09:46.266 --> 01:09:47.333
Thank you.

1497
01:09:49.934 --> 01:09:51.300
Jasmine:
Derek!

1498
01:09:51.433 --> 01:09:53.734
Are you having a good time?

1499
01:09:53.867 --> 01:09:55.467
Yeah. Yeah. I am.

1500
01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:56.767
Me too.

1501
01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:58.200
Woman:
Derek. how about a picture?

1502
01:10:00.166 --> 01:10:02.100
That's great.

1503
01:10:02.233 --> 01:10:04.600
I have to do a live-cast
in a few minutes.

1504
01:10:04.734 --> 01:10:05.934
Maybe I'll see you later.

1505
01:10:06.066 --> 01:10:09.767
Yeah. Maybe.

1506
01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:11.633
Pretty girl.

1507
01:10:11.767 --> 01:10:13.367
It's. um--

1508
01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:15.467
Oscar: I've just been approached
by two more designers.

1509
01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:17.433
They heard about
the plus-size push

1510
01:10:17.567 --> 01:10:18.533
and they want in.

1511
01:10:18.667 --> 01:10:21.533
I'm getting the same feedback.

1512
01:10:21.667 --> 01:10:23.400
I think it's time for a dance.

1513
01:10:23.533 --> 01:10:25.367
Oh. yeah.

1514
01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:28.100
Um...

1515
01:10:28.233 --> 01:10:29.233
Would you like to dance?

1516
01:10:31.834 --> 01:10:33.066
Come on.

1517
01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:36.400
You and that dress
deserve to be seen.

1518
01:10:36.533 --> 01:10:38.233
Well. when you put it like that.

1519
01:10:38.367 --> 01:10:39.333
Mm-hm.

1520
01:10:59.533 --> 01:11:01.333
Hey.

1521
01:11:01.467 --> 01:11:04.500
This is the same silk you used
to teach me about fabric.

1522
01:11:04.633 --> 01:11:06.200
You remembered.

1523
01:11:06.333 --> 01:11:08.300
Of course I did.

1524
01:11:08.433 --> 01:11:12.433
The softest hand
I ever felt.

1525
01:11:12.567 --> 01:11:15.867
♪ Just like you
stepped out of a dream ♪

1526
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.934
♪ Baby. summer sun... ♪

1527
01:11:19.066 --> 01:11:21.567
Look who's still
whispering in Derek's ear.

1528
01:11:23.066 --> 01:11:25.867
I thought I made myself clear.

1529
01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.600
He made me put her on the list.

1530
01:11:28.734 --> 01:11:31.266
Claudia: We need to do
something about her right now.

1531
01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:35.233
before this full-figured
fiasco becomes permanent policy.

1532
01:11:36.467 --> 01:11:38.033
Like what?

1533
01:11:39.567 --> 01:11:40.934
Look at her.

1534
01:11:41.066 --> 01:11:44.100
She is out of her league.

1535
01:11:44.233 --> 01:11:46.467
personally and professionally.

1536
01:11:48.734 --> 01:11:50.500
Surely she must know that.

1537
01:11:50.633 --> 01:11:51.967
Deal with it.

1538
01:11:57.066 --> 01:11:58.367
Both: Whoa.

1539
01:11:58.500 --> 01:11:59.433
Everything okay?

1540
01:11:59.567 --> 01:12:01.934
Uh. yeah. It's my shoe.

1541
01:12:02.066 --> 01:12:03.000
What happened?

1542
01:12:03.133 --> 01:12:04.433
The strap just broke.

1543
01:12:04.567 --> 01:12:05.700
Let me go get a safety pin.

1544
01:12:05.834 --> 01:12:07.433
I'll pretend
this never happened.

1545
01:12:07.567 --> 01:12:08.767
Pretend what never happened?

1546
01:12:11.367 --> 01:12:12.600
I'll be right back.

1547
01:12:12.734 --> 01:12:13.700
Okay. Go.

1548
01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:18.300
Liza:
Hello. Ella.

1549
01:12:23.066 --> 01:12:24.934
That happened to me
on a job interview.

1550
01:12:25.066 --> 01:12:26.500
I barely limped
my way through it.

1551
01:12:28.867 --> 01:12:30.667
Very pretty dress.

1552
01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:33.834
Makes you look more of
a designer than a sewer.

1553
01:12:33.967 --> 01:12:35.533
I am a designer.

1554
01:12:35.667 --> 01:12:38.400
I'd like us to be friends. Ella.

1555
01:12:38.533 --> 01:12:40.200
Maybe we can attack
the elephant in the room.

1556
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.433
That didn't come out right.

1557
01:12:44.567 --> 01:12:45.834
How do you do it?

1558
01:12:45.967 --> 01:12:47.166
Do what?

1559
01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:48.567
Live with yourself.

1560
01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:51.900
It isn't easy.

1561
01:12:52.033 --> 01:12:55.066
Which is why I'm trying
to do the right thing now.

1562
01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:57.600
And what's that?

1563
01:12:57.734 --> 01:12:59.600
You're here tonight
because Derek insisted

1564
01:12:59.734 --> 01:13:01.633
you be at this party.

1565
01:13:01.767 --> 01:13:04.567
Okay.

1566
01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:06.266
Thank you for telling me that.

1567
01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:10.834
But it isn't for
the reason you think

1568
01:13:10.967 --> 01:13:13.066
or hope.

1569
01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:16.300
He wanted to score points with
Annie Chew and all the designers

1570
01:13:16.433 --> 01:13:18.300
jumping on
the body positivity bandwagon.

1571
01:13:18.433 --> 01:13:21.767
Derek is here to sell ad space.

1572
01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:25.767
What do you think
the dance was for?

1573
01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:28.333
Taking you for a very public
spin so he could show everyone

1574
01:13:28.467 --> 01:13:29.600
what a good guy he is.

1575
01:13:29.734 --> 01:13:32.266
Okay. Liza.
you've made your point.

1576
01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:36.400
I know you think I'm the enemy.
but I'm not.

1577
01:13:36.533 --> 01:13:39.133
Derek is using you.

1578
01:13:39.266 --> 01:13:41.000
I wish you'd see that.

1579
01:13:50.967 --> 01:13:52.567
You got a great turnout.

1580
01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:54.300
Yup.

1581
01:13:54.433 --> 01:13:55.934
Your instincts were right about
taking a more inclusive stance.

1582
01:13:56.066 --> 01:13:58.266
It isn't just
an advertising strategy.

1583
01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:00.633
The Look has been perpetuating
an unhealthy standard.

1584
01:14:00.767 --> 01:14:02.066
and it's time for a change.

1585
01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:04.900
Hm. Perhaps you're right.

1586
01:14:08.767 --> 01:14:10.400
Um...

1587
01:14:10.533 --> 01:14:14.367
I want to start by thanking
you all for being here tonight.

1588
01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:16.700
The relaunch of
the digital magazine

1589
01:14:16.834 --> 01:14:17.834
means a lot to me.

1590
01:14:17.967 --> 01:14:20.367
We have an opportunity here.

1591
01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:22.567
An opportunity to
expand our readership

1592
01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:26.066
and do some good
at the same time.

1593
01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:30.800
You see. body positivity
isn't just some trendy slogan.

1594
01:14:30.934 --> 01:14:34.300
it matters. it matters to
a lot of women out there.

1595
01:14:34.433 --> 01:14:36.734
Women you all want to reach.

1596
01:14:36.867 --> 01:14:40.633
You see. size 16 is
the most common clothing size

1597
01:14:40.767 --> 01:14:42.300
for the American women.

1598
01:14:42.433 --> 01:14:45.000
and I think it's time
our magazine reflects that.

1599
01:14:45.133 --> 01:14:46.066
Oh. please.

1600
01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:48.367
Thankfully. you all agree.

1601
01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:51.567
because we just sold
all of our advertising space

1602
01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:53.166
for the first issue
of the digital magazine.

1603
01:14:54.367 --> 01:14:55.734
Yeah!

1604
01:15:00.934 --> 01:15:04.533
Now. the idea of inclusivity
extending to fashion.

1605
01:15:04.667 --> 01:15:08.066
it was new to me.
but I had a great teacher.

1606
01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:11.967
An up-and-coming designer
and someone who cares deeply

1607
01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:13.133
about these issues.

1608
01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:18.767
If I might. I'd like to
introduce to you Ella Richards.

1609
01:15:28.367 --> 01:15:30.033
Ella?

1610
01:15:30.166 --> 01:15:33.433
We are grateful for
Derek's contribution

1611
01:15:33.567 --> 01:15:34.934
to our digital counterpart.

1612
01:15:35.066 --> 01:15:36.367
Mm-hm.

1613
01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:37.767
But let's not forget
the print magazine.

1614
01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:40.433
which continues
to define fashion.

1615
01:16:05.266 --> 01:16:06.934
Ella.

1616
01:16:07.066 --> 01:16:08.800
Sewing helps me clear my mind...

1617
01:16:10.834 --> 01:16:12.333
...and my heart.

1618
01:16:12.467 --> 01:16:15.000
I don't think
it's working this time.

1619
01:16:15.133 --> 01:16:17.266
Derek texted me.

1620
01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:19.300
Said he's been
trying to reach you.

1621
01:16:19.433 --> 01:16:21.333
I'm not interested in being
some plus-sized Cinderella

1622
01:16:21.467 --> 01:16:22.633
to his Prince Charming.

1623
01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:30.100
Wear something
really nice today. okay?

1624
01:16:30.233 --> 01:16:32.100
I think I'm going to stay home.

1625
01:16:32.233 --> 01:16:35.000
Annie Chew will be there.
she's doing an editorial shoot.

1626
01:16:35.133 --> 01:16:38.533
It would be really hard
to walk into that place.

1627
01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:41.600
We publish in a few days

1628
01:16:41.734 --> 01:16:44.266
and this article could
really put you on the map.

1629
01:16:45.967 --> 01:16:49.467
Forget about the guy with
the million-dollar smile.

1630
01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:52.200
keep your eyes on the prize.

1631
01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:00.734
Alight. All systems go.

1632
01:17:00.867 --> 01:17:02.066
Ella will be here any minute.

1633
01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:03.500
It's a lot of
moving parts in this.

1634
01:17:03.633 --> 01:17:06.333
so everything needs
to move like clockwork.

1635
01:17:06.467 --> 01:17:09.233
Hi.

1636
01:17:09.367 --> 01:17:12.233
Uh. hi.

1637
01:17:12.367 --> 01:17:14.834
What's going on?

1638
01:17:14.967 --> 01:17:16.533
Uh...

1639
01:17:16.667 --> 01:17:19.333
Right before we publish.
things get a little nuts.

1640
01:17:19.467 --> 01:17:21.333
You know. you guys go ahead.
we'll go finish up.

1641
01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:28.867
Is everything okay?

1642
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.667
Yeah. Just some last minute
details I need to take care of.

1643
01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:33.900
Maybe I should wait outside.

1644
01:17:34.033 --> 01:17:37.200
Maybe-- Maybe you should
tell me what's wrong.

1645
01:17:39.367 --> 01:17:40.333
Ella.

1646
01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:43.700
Talk to me.

1647
01:17:43.834 --> 01:17:45.767
Can we just keep this about work
and leave it at that?

1648
01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:48.233
No. No. we can't.

1649
01:17:48.367 --> 01:17:49.767
I was really upset
when you left.

1650
01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:53.233
I made this big speech

1651
01:17:53.367 --> 01:17:54.667
and introduced you. and...

1652
01:17:57.533 --> 01:18:00.166
The woman who
inspired it all she--

1653
01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:01.667
she wasn't there.

1654
01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:04.233
I felt like you were using me

1655
01:18:04.367 --> 01:18:07.233
to make some kind of statement
and sell more ads.

1656
01:18:07.367 --> 01:18:09.233
Ella. I thought you
knew me better than that.

1657
01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:13.767
You know how you always
talk about my honesty?

1658
01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:16.734
Uh-huh.

1659
01:18:16.867 --> 01:18:20.166
Well. maybe I haven't
been honest with myself.

1660
01:18:22.433 --> 01:18:23.567
I do know you.

1661
01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:27.200
and I know how much
I care for you.

1662
01:18:30.734 --> 01:18:35.133
I think that's what
I'm running from.

1663
01:18:35.266 --> 01:18:36.967
Let's get real.
I'm not exactly your type.

1664
01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:38.266
What do you think my type is?

1665
01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:40.266
You have cover girls
like Jasmine--

1666
01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:41.400
Jasmine doesn't even--

1667
01:18:41.533 --> 01:18:42.934
What exactly do I mean to you?!

1668
01:18:47.467 --> 01:18:48.867
Ella. You. Ella.

1669
01:18:50.934 --> 01:18:53.600
You mean everything to me.

1670
01:18:58.133 --> 01:19:01.734
Which is why I need you
to come with me.

1671
01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:07.033
Come on. Come on.

1672
01:19:07.166 --> 01:19:08.033
Where are we going?

1673
01:19:08.166 --> 01:19:09.133
You'll see.

1674
01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.166
Father.
What are you doing here?

1675
01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:17.667
I was hoping
we could have lunch.

1676
01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:20.033
Hello. Ella.
it's very nice to see you again.

1677
01:19:20.166 --> 01:19:21.834
You too.

1678
01:19:21.967 --> 01:19:24.867
I'm sorry. it's very busy.
there's a lot going on today.

1679
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000
It's not a good time.

1680
01:19:26.133 --> 01:19:28.066
Oh. alright.

1681
01:19:29.633 --> 01:19:32.467
Well. this will
just take a moment.

1682
01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:34.867
but I think it's important.

1683
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.300
I just came from a board
meeting where I found myself

1684
01:19:37.433 --> 01:19:40.834
saying that
the future of the company...

1685
01:19:42.667 --> 01:19:43.900
...is in good hands.

1686
01:19:46.934 --> 01:19:48.467
The hands of
my very capable son.

1687
01:19:52.033 --> 01:19:53.000
Thanks. Dad.

1688
01:20:00.467 --> 01:20:02.300
- Derek?
- Yeah?

1689
01:20:02.433 --> 01:20:03.667
We need to get to the studio!

1690
01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:05.300
Right. I'll. uh--
I'll be right there.

1691
01:20:05.433 --> 01:20:07.834
Is it always this
busy around here?

1692
01:20:07.967 --> 01:20:11.200
Busy? Yes.
Happy? No.

1693
01:20:11.333 --> 01:20:12.433
That's new.

1694
01:20:14.934 --> 01:20:15.900
Bye.

1695
01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:22.266
Fashion.

1696
01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:28.333
I just wanted to say hello.

1697
01:20:28.467 --> 01:20:29.667
Hello. Ella.

1698
01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:31.133
Max. I didn't know
you'd be here.

1699
01:20:31.266 --> 01:20:33.166
Where else would I be
on such a big day?

1700
01:20:33.300 --> 01:20:36.767
Annie gave me some great quotes
that you might want to hear.

1701
01:20:38.367 --> 01:20:40.367
I think you're
very talented. Ella.

1702
01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:41.967
and I think you care
about your customer.

1703
01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:43.633
I do.

1704
01:20:43.767 --> 01:20:45.667
I want to expand
my company.

1705
01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:47.233
I have been looking
for a designer

1706
01:20:47.367 --> 01:20:50.834
that can do
full-figured women justice.

1707
01:20:50.967 --> 01:20:52.633
I think that's you.

1708
01:20:54.133 --> 01:20:55.667
I would like to be
in business with you.

1709
01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:58.166
I don't know what to say.

1710
01:20:58.300 --> 01:20:59.700
I would go with yes.

1711
01:20:59.834 --> 01:21:03.433
Yes. yes.
The biggest. loudest yes ever!

1712
01:21:05.367 --> 01:21:07.400
Well. then let's get the word
out about Ella Originals.

1713
01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:12.233
Oh. Bert is doing
your photo shoot.

1714
01:21:12.367 --> 01:21:16.734
No. Ella.
he is doing your shoot.

1715
01:21:16.867 --> 01:21:19.367
Derek gave me an offer
I couldn't refuse.

1716
01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:21.900
He said he would let me
shoot my favourite model.

1717
01:21:28.433 --> 01:21:30.266
Candice Huffine.
Wearing my dress.

1718
01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:34.133
Hi. Ella. Congratulations.
I'm so excited for you.

1719
01:21:34.266 --> 01:21:36.200
Thank you.

1720
01:21:36.333 --> 01:21:37.934
Wow.

1721
01:21:38.066 --> 01:21:40.400
You are a hero of mine.

1722
01:21:40.533 --> 01:21:44.066
I mean. your confidence

1723
01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:46.800
is as stunning as your beauty.

1724
01:21:46.934 --> 01:21:49.700
Thank you for
helping me find mine.

1725
01:21:49.834 --> 01:21:52.467
Thank you. It is such
an honour to be here.

1726
01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:54.233
And I know that
we're going to be great friends.

1727
01:21:54.367 --> 01:21:58.200
And I say we take some photos
of this gorgeous creation.

1728
01:21:58.333 --> 01:21:59.200

Yeah. you are.

1744

the Prince.

1745
01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:44.967
No.

01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:48.367
