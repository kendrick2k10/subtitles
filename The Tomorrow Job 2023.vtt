00:00:28.097 --> 00:00:31.272
What do you want? Let me go!

4
00:00:34.586 --> 00:00:37.485
This is my house!
What do you want?

5
00:00:52.293 --> 00:00:53.915
Hello. Dr. Muller.

6
00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:56.504
What is this? What's going on?

7
00:00:56.642 --> 00:00:58.782
You've been
injected with a microchip.

8
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.268
a consciousness communications
device we've been developing

9
00:01:01.406 --> 00:01:02.855
here at the organization.

10
00:01:02.993 --> 00:01:04.926
What do you know
about Project Z Plus?

11
00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:07.964
- Almost nothing.
- It's funny.

12
00:01:08.102 --> 00:01:10.656
It's been said that humans
are the only species

13
00:01:10.794 --> 00:01:13.797
with a true understanding
of the concept of time.

14
00:01:13.935 --> 00:01:18.147
but. as it turns out. time
is actually rather malleable.

15
00:01:18.285 --> 00:01:20.010
What is time in reality other

16
00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:23.566
than a concept of our
own interpretation?

17
00:01:25.947 --> 00:01:29.434
This pill allows us to
interpret that sense

18
00:01:29.572 --> 00:01:32.609
of time differently.

19
00:01:33.748 --> 00:01:36.475
An hour here for an hour there.

20
00:01:36.613 --> 00:01:39.340
Today. tomorrow
forwards. backwards.

21
00:01:39.478 --> 00:01:43.310
consciousness. time travel.
I don't have any.

22
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:49.971
No. If you had.
you'd have known we were coming.

23
00:01:51.145 --> 00:01:54.976
Tell me. do you know the
whereabouts of this man?

24
00:01:56.633 --> 00:01:58.635
That man? He's dead?

25
00:02:01.776 --> 00:02:02.605
Sure.

26
00:02:03.985 --> 00:02:07.299
My information tells me
he was rather generous

27
00:02:07.437 --> 00:02:09.198
in sharing his
information with you.

28
00:02:09.336 --> 00:02:11.372
He was a colleague in
the science community.

29
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.789
That is all. I am sorry.

30
00:02:15.583 --> 00:02:19.553
Sir. we found
something. Uploading now.

31
00:02:24.213 --> 00:02:26.180

61
00:04:22.917 --> 00:04:23.642
She's coming.

62
00:04:28.613 --> 00:04:29.648
Welcome to tomorrow.

63
00:04:39.624 --> 00:04:40.797
There's little to no security.

64
00:04:40.935 --> 00:04:42.351
so this should be
relatively simple.

65
00:04:42.489 --> 00:04:44.007
These should get
you to the elevator

66
00:04:44.145 --> 00:04:45.837
and up to the 13th floor.

67
00:04:45.975 --> 00:04:48.357
They hire an external vendor
for the afternoon cleanup.

68
00:04:48.495 --> 00:04:52.499
- And the target is?
- White boarding room. 1334.

69
00:04:54.363 --> 00:04:55.881
I can never see shit
in these contacts.

70
00:04:56.019 --> 00:04:59.471
You and me keep going
in with purple eyes. so.

71
00:04:59.609 --> 00:05:01.024
Will you be able
to see the target?

72
00:05:01.162 --> 00:05:04.856
- Maybe. It won't be perfect.
- Well. we need perfect.

73
00:05:04.994 --> 00:05:07.134
Keep 'em in until
the target's in view.

74
00:05:07.272 --> 00:05:09.343
Okay. Everything will
just be blurry until then.

75
00:05:09.481 --> 00:05:10.724
Good. Remember. no details.

76
00:05:10.862 --> 00:05:12.173
We don't want to know
what this company does.

77
00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:14.417
who works there. nothing.

78
00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:28.880
Lee. Martin. can you hear me?

79
00:05:29.018 --> 00:05:30.330
Loud and clear

80
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:35.852
Fucking contacts.

81
00:05:44.033 --> 00:05:47.070
Hold it. hold it.
hold. hold! Phew.

82
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.400
Didn't you guys
switch to mornings?

83
00:06:06.538 --> 00:06:10.128
I could've swore I got
that memo last week.

84
00:06:10.266 --> 00:06:14.235
Shit. the cleaning
schedule's from last month.

85
00:06:15.202 --> 00:06:16.237
Oh. oh.

86
00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:17.722
That's for daylight
savings. sir.

87
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.587
We don't switch
over till next week.

88
00:06:20.725 --> 00:06:23.762
Oh. okay. Well. good for you.

89
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.939
I hate those dark
mornings. Take care.

90
00:06:29.906 --> 00:06:32.909
- Thanks Martin.
- Oh. anytime. Finn.

91
00:06:52.066 --> 00:06:53.343
We're in. You're up. Finn.

92
00:06:53.482 --> 00:06:55.138
- Ready?
- We're ready.

93
00:06:55.276 --> 00:06:56.208
Showtime.

94
00:07:01.317 --> 00:07:02.974
May I
have your attention please?

95
00:07:03.112 --> 00:07:04.354
This is not a drill.

96
00:07:04.493 --> 00:07:07.910
At the building. do
not use the elevators.

97
00:07:08.048 --> 00:07:11.741
After you leave the
building. please wait.

98
00:07:19.991 --> 00:07:21.371
Can't see shit.

99
00:07:35.593 --> 00:07:37.180
- How are we on time?
- 10 Minutes.

100
00:07:37.318 --> 00:07:38.354
We should be fine.

101
00:07:46.086 --> 00:07:46.880
I'll go inside.

102
00:07:47.018 --> 00:07:48.709
You get the look at the girl.

103
00:07:48.847 --> 00:07:49.676
Oh. no.

104
00:07:53.714 --> 00:07:57.580
Not sure you
needed me for this one.

105
00:08:01.515 --> 00:08:04.725
Finn. Where are
you? Finn. hello?

106
00:08:04.863 --> 00:08:06.037
We're getting ambushed.

107
00:08:06.175 --> 00:08:08.177
Just get out and meet
me at the loading dock.

108
00:08:08.315 --> 00:08:10.386
I ditched the van for
now. We'll get it later.

109
00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:15.564
- We work for-
- Quiet.

110
00:08:17.635 --> 00:08:19.257
I found 'em.
Copy.

111
00:08:21.984 --> 00:08:23.537
Come on. let's go.

112
00:08:28.335 --> 00:08:31.545
Lee. Martin.
where are you guys?

113
00:08:31.683 --> 00:08:35.894
Can you tell us who you
are or where we're going?

114
00:08:37.447 --> 00:08:40.554
This would make sense
with the mask and all.

115
00:08:40.692 --> 00:08:44.593
Open the door. Come on.

116
00:09:25.841 --> 00:09:28.395
- You okay?
- Yeah. We're okay.

117
00:09:29.603 --> 00:09:30.777
You really like
those tranquilizers.

118
00:09:30.915 --> 00:09:31.985
- What's going on?
- You tell me.

119
00:09:32.123 --> 00:09:34.366
Who are those guys?
I have no idea.

120
00:09:34.504 --> 00:09:35.298
We need to get away

121
00:09:35.436 --> 00:09:37.093
from here before we switch back.

122
00:09:37.231 --> 00:09:38.716
Finn. you have the car jacker.

123
00:09:38.854 --> 00:09:41.373
Yeah. I have it. It's
not ready. but I have it.

124
00:09:41.511 --> 00:09:44.342
50-50 shot it'll work.
50-50?

125
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.413
- Maybe 60-40.
- Do it.

126
00:09:47.517 --> 00:09:49.796
Pick us up in the back.
Motherfucker.

127
00:10:10.161 --> 00:10:11.611
How we doing. Finn?

128
00:10:11.749 --> 00:10:13.716
Two minutes
until we jump back!

129
00:10:13.854 --> 00:10:17.168
- Yeah. I'm working on it.
- Where the fuck is she?

130
00:10:20.067 --> 00:10:21.379
Got it.

131
00:10:30.457 --> 00:10:32.079
One minute!

132
00:10:36.014 --> 00:10:39.190
For Christ's sake.
this isn't tea time!

133
00:10:42.296 --> 00:10:43.470
Let's go.

134
00:10:43.608 --> 00:10:44.644
I'm sure you'll
thank me later.

135
00:10:44.782 --> 00:10:47.129
- We're not out yet.
- 40 seconds!

136
00:10:51.443 --> 00:10:52.375
Well shit.

137
00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:58.174
Jesus Christ. Finn!

138
00:11:15.502 --> 00:11:18.747
Five seconds. See
you in the truck.

139
00:11:27.652 --> 00:11:29.102
Well. that was a shit show.

140
00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.759
We'll talk about
it when we get back.

141
00:11:48.259 --> 00:11:49.778
We have to do something.

142
00:11:49.916 --> 00:11:51.227
Look. what if we just.

143
00:11:51.365 --> 00:11:52.677
we change the dates.
Stop. You know the rules.

144
00:11:52.815 --> 00:11:54.334
We don't do anything
that will affect tomorrow

145
00:11:54.472 --> 00:11:56.957
between 2:05 and 3:05 PM.

146
00:11:57.095 --> 00:11:57.889
Martin.

147
00:11:59.097 --> 00:12:00.961
Your rules are going
to get us killed.

148
00:12:01.099 --> 00:12:02.376
They're the only things
that are keeping our feet

149
00:12:02.514 --> 00:12:03.619
on the ground.

150
00:12:03.757 --> 00:12:05.655
Do you have the target?
Yeah.

151
00:12:05.794 --> 00:12:07.796
Again. don't think you
needed me for that.

152
00:12:07.934 --> 00:12:11.282
Maybe. maybe not. but I
don't have photographic memory.

153
00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:13.940
It needs to be verbatim.
I'm worried about this.

154
00:12:14.078 --> 00:12:16.390
Come on. Finn. The
car jacker worked. right?

155
00:12:16.528 --> 00:12:19.324
Whoa. whoa. wait. What happens
when it does it work. Finn?

156
00:12:19.462 --> 00:12:20.670
All the electronics
in the car seize up

157
00:12:20.809 --> 00:12:22.949
for 30 seconds and
we get locked inside.

158
00:12:23.087 --> 00:12:24.329
- Oh.
- But it did work.

159
00:12:24.467 --> 00:12:25.814
- Oh.
- And that means that it

160
00:12:25.952 --> 00:12:27.574
is your job to make sure
that it still works tomorrow.

161
00:12:27.712 --> 00:12:29.887
and then when we get
out of the city safely.

162
00:12:30.025 --> 00:12:33.580
we'll figure out the rest.
Where are you going?

163
00:12:33.718 --> 00:12:35.755
I gotta get up early tomorrow.

164
00:12:35.893 --> 00:12:38.688

00:12:38.827 --> 00:12:41.657

What you're
experiencing right now

188
00:15:21.161 --> 00:15:24.613
are the effects of
consciousness time trading.

189
00:15:24.751 --> 00:15:27.443
You see. your mind is
reordering its events.

190
00:15:27.581 --> 00:15:28.997
I saw...

191
00:15:29.135 --> 00:15:32.621
You saw tomorrow. and
tomorrow. you'll see today.

192
00:15:56.817 --> 00:15:58.543
The money should be in
your account within the hour.

193
00:15:58.681 --> 00:15:59.372
Thanks.

194
00:16:02.202 --> 00:16:04.791
By the way. the
offer still stands.

195
00:16:04.929 --> 00:16:06.241
You hand over the supply.

196
00:16:06.379 --> 00:16:09.865
and I promise you can
name any number you want.

197
00:16:10.003 --> 00:16:11.867
Not interested.

198
00:16:12.005 --> 00:16:14.663
May I at least have your name?

199
00:16:15.698 --> 00:16:19.530
Have a good day.

200
00:16:25.777 --> 00:16:26.709
You okay?

201
00:16:28.953 --> 00:16:30.403
Yeah.

202
00:16:30.541 --> 00:16:31.887
You ready?
Yep.

203
00:16:45.004 --> 00:16:48.421
- Welcome to yesterday.
- Now we wait.

204
00:16:54.392 --> 00:16:55.773
Okay. tell me again.

205
00:16:55.911 --> 00:16:57.533
What exactly is the plan
once you're back in the car?

206
00:16:57.671 --> 00:17:00.571
We wake up. we drive out
of town. and we assess.

207
00:17:00.709 --> 00:17:02.573
So basically wing it.

208
00:17:11.858 --> 00:17:12.928
10 seconds.

209
00:17:16.414 --> 00:17:17.726
Three. two. one.

210
00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:27.184
- Get us outta the city.
- On it.

211
00:17:40.128 --> 00:17:41.267
Oh!

212
00:17:41.405 --> 00:17:43.165
I don't know who
the fuck that was.

213
00:17:43.303 --> 00:17:46.479
but they weren't no
match for Lee Warner!

214
00:17:46.617 --> 00:17:48.791
Coming in in the red shorts.

215
00:17:48.929 --> 00:17:53.727
weighing 175 pounds.
Lee Warner!

216
00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:57.006
What exactly did you
do in this operation?

217
00:17:57.145 --> 00:18:00.251
Amateur hour all day.
every day. 50-50. Finn.

218
00:18:00.389 --> 00:18:04.221
50-50. 60-40. No.
I'm just saying.

219
00:18:04.359 --> 00:18:05.394
Oh. fuck.

220
00:18:08.639 --> 00:18:09.743
Fucking Christ. Go!

221
00:18:12.919 --> 00:18:14.576
Go! Goddammit. Finn!

222
00:18:32.421 --> 00:18:34.837
What was that?
It won't go.

223
00:18:34.975 --> 00:18:35.907
The brakes are locked up.

224
00:18:36.045 --> 00:18:38.047
60. 40 on that
car jacker. huh?

225
00:18:38.186 --> 00:18:39.911
All right. we're
out. We're on foot.

226
00:18:45.158 --> 00:18:46.849
Hey! Hey. it won't open!

227
00:18:51.371 --> 00:18:56.307
- Where the fuck's Martin?
- Motherfucker! It won't open!

228
00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:57.653
I can't!

229
00:19:02.106 --> 00:19:03.314
Fuck.

230
00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.263
Oh. shit.
No!

231
00:20:22.255 --> 00:20:23.394
I'm into the future.

232
00:20:23.532 --> 00:20:25.120
I'm at tomorrow and I
spend an hour there.

233
00:20:25.258 --> 00:20:27.053
but that hour is
actually here today.

234
00:20:27.191 --> 00:20:29.158
Wait. wait. wait.
wait. wait. wait. wait.

235
00:20:29.297 --> 00:20:30.884
What you're talking
about is. what.

236
00:20:31.022 --> 00:20:32.576
some kind of time machine?

237
00:20:32.714 --> 00:20:34.302
Kind of. but it's
just for your mind.

238
00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:38.029
It's not for your body. I'm
not explaining this well.

239
00:20:38.167 --> 00:20:39.548
Okay. so-
Are you sure they

240
00:20:39.686 --> 00:20:41.032
weren't just giving
you some psychedelics?

241
00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:43.311
No. man.

242
00:20:45.796 --> 00:20:47.315
Okay. shit. Okay.

243
00:20:51.491 --> 00:20:53.424
Well. thank you.

244
00:20:53.562 --> 00:20:54.701
Are you sure you have the money?

245
00:20:54.839 --> 00:20:55.806
Yeah. man.

246
00:20:57.532 --> 00:20:59.879
All right. then I owe you.

247
00:21:00.017 --> 00:21:01.156
No. and there's more.

248
00:21:01.294 --> 00:21:04.884
So before I have left.
they gave me a job.

249
00:21:05.022 --> 00:21:05.885
It's a really good job.

250
00:21:06.023 --> 00:21:07.990
It pays really well. and Matty.

251
00:21:08.128 --> 00:21:10.752
we're finally gonna get you
the treatment that you need.

252
00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:12.823
I am getting the
treatment I need.

253
00:21:12.961 --> 00:21:15.412
Fuck that. the treatment
that you deserve.

254
00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:20.140
You and me were gonna
beat this thing together.

255
00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:22.142
You're not lying?

256
00:21:22.281 --> 00:21:24.593
No. I really believe that.

257
00:22:02.459 --> 00:22:06.601

258
00:22:06.739 --> 00:22:11.433

263
00:22:28.416 --> 00:22:31.384
All we're asking for is
a little more transparency.

264
00:22:31.522 --> 00:22:34.145
You have to understand.
We don't know your name.

265
00:22:34.283 --> 00:22:35.802
We can't see your face.

266
00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.149
We've discussed it and believe
you should consult the board

267
00:22:38.287 --> 00:22:40.255
for any future
trades of this size.

268
00:22:40.393 --> 00:22:41.463
Is that right?

269
00:22:41.601 --> 00:22:44.570
You seem a bit unpredictable.

270
00:22:44.708 --> 00:22:48.297
Unpredictable.
really. That's cute.

271
00:22:48.436 --> 00:22:49.747
Tell me. how much money
has your firm cleared

272
00:22:49.885 --> 00:22:51.473
in the past six months
thanks to the organization?

273
00:22:51.611 --> 00:22:54.925
Look. we're not questioning
your value to the company.

274
00:22:55.063 --> 00:22:58.100
There is nothing
unpredictable about what I do.

275
00:22:58.238 --> 00:22:59.654
Markets change.

276
00:22:59.792 --> 00:23:02.450
You keep trading like this
and you'll eventually lose.

277
00:23:02.588 --> 00:23:06.730
The world is unpredictable.
People are unpredictable.

278
00:23:06.868 --> 00:23:10.319
On the contrary.
people are the product.

279
00:23:12.045 --> 00:23:14.979
and they're a product
that should be controlled.

280
00:23:15.117 --> 00:23:18.466
Stick with me and
reap the benefits.

281
00:23:18.604 --> 00:23:22.159
or else we can part ways
right here right now.

282
00:23:22.297 --> 00:23:26.197
No. no. that won't
be necessary. Carry on.

283
00:23:30.305 --> 00:23:31.617
You requested
to speak with me.

284
00:23:31.755 --> 00:23:35.241
Yes. I have a job
for our little friend.

285
00:23:36.725 --> 00:23:39.832
I thought he was clear he
no longer wished to cooperate.

286
00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:42.041
Yes. well. you and I both
know what happens to people

287
00:23:42.179 --> 00:23:44.526
who don't cooperate
with the organization.

288
00:23:44.664 --> 00:23:46.908
Let's make sure he
gets that message.

289
00:23:47.046 --> 00:23:49.738
I'll do my
best. but to be honest.

290
00:23:49.876 --> 00:23:52.672
the man is a bit of an idiot.

291
00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:55.434
That man is key to everything.

292
00:24:13.003 --> 00:24:14.418
Hello?

293
00:24:14.556 --> 00:24:15.177
I see
you're enjoying the company

294
00:24:15.315 --> 00:24:16.006
of your new friends.

295
00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:21.736
Don't worry. you're
safe. for now.

296
00:24:23.254 --> 00:24:26.085
Well. I have
another job for you.

297
00:24:26.223 --> 00:24:28.881
Saying no isn't
really an option.

298
00:24:37.959 --> 00:24:39.305
No!

299
00:25:10.992 --> 00:25:13.615
How did they get our
names? Our addresses?

300
00:25:13.753 --> 00:25:15.962
You said we were good.
I don't know.

301
00:25:17.688 --> 00:25:19.690
And what are we supposed to
do? You got rid of it. right?

302
00:25:19.828 --> 00:25:24.419
Yeah. I mean. could just
ignore 'em. call their bluff.

303
00:25:25.593 --> 00:25:27.595
Did you already
forget what happened?

304
00:25:27.733 --> 00:25:28.803
Wait. when you came to
meet with this shit.

305
00:25:28.941 --> 00:25:30.114
you told me that these jobs

306
00:25:30.252 --> 00:25:33.014
were gonna be low
risk. high reward.

307
00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:37.018
I think about it every day.

308
00:25:37.156 --> 00:25:39.261
You think that I don't
feel the same way as you?

309
00:25:39.399 --> 00:25:42.748
No. you don't 'cause
it wasn't your fault.

310
00:25:42.886 --> 00:25:44.681
It never should've
come to that.

311
00:25:44.819 --> 00:25:47.097
We weren't prepared for an
ambush. and that's on me.

312
00:25:47.235 --> 00:25:50.272
Regardless. I trusted you then.
and I still trust you now.

313
00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:52.516
I mean. you trust me don't you?

314
00:25:52.654 --> 00:25:54.656
Honestly. no. I don't.

315
00:25:56.106 --> 00:26:00.006
Well. I guess that's
why we never worked out.

316
00:26:00.144 --> 00:26:02.181
Worked out? What?

317
00:26:02.319 --> 00:26:06.081
New Hampshire.
baby. two years ago.

318
00:26:06.219 --> 00:26:08.428
That was a long time ago.

319
00:26:12.363 --> 00:26:15.781
Did you actually get rid
of it like we talked about?

320
00:26:15.919 --> 00:26:19.370
Yeah. What's with the
new decals on the van?

321
00:26:19.508 --> 00:26:21.614
Starting my own
security company.

322
00:26:21.752 --> 00:26:25.238
- Yeah. that sounds fun.
- Yeah. it's not.

323
00:26:29.657 --> 00:26:32.418
Why aren't we already dead?

324
00:26:38.217 --> 00:26:42.566
You motherfucker. You
still have the Z. don't you?

325
00:26:49.711 --> 00:26:51.713
And you wonder why
I don't trust you.

326
00:26:51.851 --> 00:26:53.922
Fine. but I'm not using.

327
00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:55.441
Lee. we
talked about this.

328
00:26:55.579 --> 00:26:56.649
After what happened to Martin.

329
00:26:56.787 --> 00:26:58.168
we both agreed that
this had to end.

330
00:26:58.306 --> 00:26:59.618
Yes. but we also both
agreed the less you know.

331
00:26:59.756 --> 00:27:00.653
the better.

332
00:27:00.791 --> 00:27:02.034
The rules-
Oh my God!

333
00:27:02.172 --> 00:27:04.243
I know. the rules. Just save it.

334
00:27:04.381 --> 00:27:05.762
Okay. but in my defense.

335
00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:07.902
the organization is gonna kill
us if we don't do this job.

336
00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.524
so you're welcome.

337
00:27:14.425 --> 00:27:17.049
14 account
numbers? It's a lot.

338
00:27:18.706 --> 00:27:21.260
It's also a big price tag.

339
00:27:21.398 --> 00:27:24.263
Look. one last job
and we're done.

340
00:27:25.609 --> 00:27:27.473
- Gonna need a new photog.
- I'll handle it.

341
00:27:27.611 --> 00:27:31.788
You can barely handle
yourself. What's your plan?

342
00:27:32.892 --> 00:27:34.963
I'm gonna go see Danny.

343
00:27:36.378 --> 00:27:37.725
Okay. Whatever.

344
00:27:39.658 --> 00:27:40.831
If we're gonna do this. I
need to start planning now.

345
00:27:40.969 --> 00:27:43.316
so just make it happen.

346
00:27:43.454 --> 00:27:44.628
Take a shower.

347
00:28:21.769 --> 00:28:23.391
Not today.

348
00:28:23.529 --> 00:28:26.566
Cici. it is good to see you.

349
00:28:26.705 --> 00:28:28.707
What do you want. Lee?

350
00:28:28.845 --> 00:28:31.951
I just came by to say hello.
see how you were doing.

351
00:28:32.089 --> 00:28:34.574
Just fine until you showed up.

352
00:28:34.713 --> 00:28:37.025
- Where's Danny?
- He's busy.

353
00:28:39.856 --> 00:28:40.960
Two seconds.

354
00:28:54.249 --> 00:28:55.181
We'll see what's up.

355
00:28:55.319 --> 00:28:56.286
- Good. baby?
- Yep.

356
00:28:56.424 --> 00:28:58.944
- All right.
- All right. right on.

357
00:29:00.221 --> 00:29:01.325
Thought I smelled
some shit up in here.

358
00:29:01.463 --> 00:29:05.847
Danny.
How you doing. man?

359
00:29:05.985 --> 00:29:07.124
Man. you better tell me

360
00:29:07.262 --> 00:29:08.505
what the fuck you're
doing in here. man.

361
00:29:08.643 --> 00:29:09.989
I'm just coming by to say hi.

362
00:29:10.127 --> 00:29:12.681
Your ass better not
be here making no bets.

363
00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:13.890
I wouldn't dream of it.

364
00:29:14.028 --> 00:29:14.822
Damn right you
wouldn't dream of it.

365
00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.099
You still owe me. motherfucker.

366
00:29:16.237 --> 00:29:19.412
That is exactly
what I'm going here.

367
00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:21.483
Paying you back. baby.

368
00:29:28.525 --> 00:29:29.802
I guess it's a start. huh?

369
00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:33.081
How you been?

370
00:29:33.219 --> 00:29:35.981
I'm fussing. I bought
a boat last summer. huh?

371
00:29:36.119 --> 00:29:37.396
Yeah?

372
00:29:37.534 --> 00:29:39.191
Thought I might like
fishing. Turns out I don't.

373
00:29:39.329 --> 00:29:41.365
Know anybody looking to buy?
Sorry.

374
00:29:41.503 --> 00:29:43.264
Ah. it's all right.

375
00:29:44.506 --> 00:29:47.820
- I need a favor.
- Of course you do.

376
00:29:47.958 --> 00:29:50.202
Can you stop being
such a sourpuss?

377
00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:53.067
Sourpuss? Let me
explain something to you.

378
00:29:53.205 --> 00:29:56.725
You spent four years
coming in here making bets.

379
00:29:56.864 --> 00:29:58.313
taking my fucking money.

380
00:29:58.451 --> 00:30:00.937
only for me to find out you've
been using that Z bullshit.

381
00:30:01.075 --> 00:30:02.835
Danny. that was the old me.

382
00:30:02.973 --> 00:30:04.457
Those days is gone.
You know what I mean?

383
00:30:04.595 --> 00:30:07.736
It's all over. It's a
brand new Lee. right?

384
00:30:07.875 --> 00:30:09.911
You still live in that RV
that you won off Simpson?

385
00:30:10.049 --> 00:30:12.362
Yeah.

386
00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:14.571
How about that Mercedes
that you won off Tanner?

387
00:30:14.709 --> 00:30:17.470
You still rolling
around in that?

388
00:30:17.608 --> 00:30:20.473
Okay. yeah. Not a
fucking thing changed.

389
00:30:20.611 --> 00:30:22.821
You're a son of a
bitch. you know that?

390
00:30:22.959 --> 00:30:25.444
And this money. where's
this coming from. huh?

391
00:30:25.582 --> 00:30:26.963
Oh. you spend your days working

392
00:30:27.101 --> 00:30:30.863
as a substitute teacher
making it the honest way?

393
00:30:31.001 --> 00:30:33.555
No. I ain't think so.

394
00:30:33.693 --> 00:30:35.764
Your ass is still using. Lee.

395
00:30:35.903 --> 00:30:37.318
which is why I can
trust you about

396
00:30:37.456 --> 00:30:40.183
as far as I can toss you.

397
00:30:40.321 --> 00:30:43.186
What do you want. man?
I need a photog.

398
00:30:43.324 --> 00:30:46.706
Okay. What the fuck
happened to Martin?

399
00:30:47.673 --> 00:30:48.743
He retired.

400
00:30:51.194 --> 00:30:53.713
I'm sorry to hear that. Okay?

401
00:30:53.852 --> 00:30:55.474
But that right there.
that's the bullshit. Okay?

402
00:30:55.612 --> 00:30:58.201
That's why you need
to stop. All right?

403
00:30:58.339 --> 00:31:02.861
That's what happens when
you start fucking with time!

404
00:31:02.999 --> 00:31:05.035
As long as you got these pills.

405
00:31:05.173 --> 00:31:06.726
you'll never be
able to walk away.

406
00:31:06.865 --> 00:31:08.107
Once an addict.
always an addict.

407
00:31:08.245 --> 00:31:10.178
Ain't they right. what they say?

408
00:31:10.316 --> 00:31:15.183
You two are bookies. You make
your living off of addicts.

409
00:31:17.876 --> 00:31:22.156
- That's fair enough.
- I got a job. It's a big one.

410
00:31:24.158 --> 00:31:25.745
You two help me out.

411
00:31:25.884 --> 00:31:29.128
I'll pay you back
double what I owe you.

412
00:31:35.445 --> 00:31:39.794
You're lucky somebody
loves you. Tell you what.

413
00:31:39.932 --> 00:31:41.865
Yeah. I do know someone.

414
00:31:42.003 --> 00:31:45.006
Old Theo from the racino
came in the other day.

415
00:31:45.144 --> 00:31:47.284
talking about some lady
he had to kick out.

416
00:31:47.422 --> 00:31:49.493
Said she was the best
counter he ever seen.

417
00:31:52.462 --> 00:31:54.050
Spends her days on
campus collecting money

418
00:31:54.188 --> 00:31:55.465
from all the rich college kids.

419
00:31:55.603 --> 00:31:58.606
just taking all
their tests and shit.

420
00:32:00.746 --> 00:32:02.851
♪ Come on. whoo ♪

421
00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:04.129
♪ Yeah ♪

422
00:32:04.267 --> 00:32:07.546
Yeah. she's
a tough little thing.

423
00:32:09.444 --> 00:32:13.379
♪ Come on. whoo ♪

424
00:32:13.517 --> 00:32:16.106
♪ Come on. whoo ♪

425
00:32:16.244 --> 00:32:18.039
And her nights. yeah.

426
00:32:18.177 --> 00:32:20.524
She spends those at
the casino on Broadway.

427
00:32:22.906 --> 00:32:25.115
She set up the table
right here in this bar.

428
00:32:25.253 --> 00:32:27.669
Chances are she'll be
here later on tonight.

429
00:32:27.807 --> 00:32:29.637
way past
my bedtime though.

430
00:32:59.667 --> 00:33:02.911
Saw you on campus and
now here. What do you want?

431
00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:04.327
I don't think you're
a student. are you?

432
00:33:04.465 --> 00:33:05.949
I might be. You
here to blackmail me?

433
00:33:06.087 --> 00:33:08.572
Not quite. I do have
a proposal for you.

434
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:10.333
Also. you know you don't
need a photographic memory

435
00:33:10.471 --> 00:33:13.129
to count cards. right?
Doesn't hurt.

436
00:33:13.267 --> 00:33:15.269
You got a history
of drug abuse?

437
00:33:15.407 --> 00:33:17.236
What? No.

438
00:33:17.374 --> 00:33:19.894
Good. Don't take it.

439
00:33:20.032 --> 00:33:23.070
But I usually love taking
pills from strange men at bars.

440
00:33:23.208 --> 00:33:25.486
It's called Z
Plus. Look it up.

441
00:33:25.624 --> 00:33:26.797
If you're interested.
meet me tomorrow.

442
00:33:26.935 --> 00:33:28.523
Jenning's Landing. 8:00 AM.

443
00:33:46.748 --> 00:33:48.474
What's up. everyone.
Welcome back to the channel.

444
00:33:48.612 --> 00:33:49.958
First things first.

445
00:33:50.097 --> 00:33:51.650
I wanna remind you to like.
comment. and subscribe.

446
00:33:51.788 --> 00:33:52.892
If you haven't already.

447
00:33:53.031 --> 00:33:54.342
make sure you hit that
little notification bell

448
00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.654
at the bottom so you
never miss another video.

449
00:33:55.792 --> 00:33:57.000
Let's just dive right in.

450
00:33:57.138 --> 00:33:59.037
A question popped
into my feed today

451
00:33:59.175 --> 00:34:02.316
about a Reddit post detailing
a so-called time travel pill.

452
00:34:02.454 --> 00:34:04.663
I took a look and. of course.
met it with heavy skepticism.

453
00:34:04.801 --> 00:34:07.010
But after a little bit of
research. I'm not so sure.

454
00:34:07.148 --> 00:34:08.632
To really understand
where all this comes from.

455
00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:10.082
we're gonna have to go
back a couple of years

456
00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:12.291
and talk about a man
named Dr. Jay Tupple.

457
00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:14.431
He was a neurophysicist
who died in 2018.

458
00:34:14.569 --> 00:34:16.226
or so they say. but
more on that later.

459
00:34:16.364 --> 00:34:19.298
His studies on the concept
of consciousness time trading

460
00:34:19.436 --> 00:34:20.851
were considered
controversial due

461
00:34:20.989 --> 00:34:22.784
to his use of human
test subjects.

462
00:34:22.922 --> 00:34:24.683
Now the serum.
which was called Z.

463
00:34:24.821 --> 00:34:26.581
reportedly made
the subjects crazy.

464
00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:29.550
Later. it was advanced
into its current pill form

465
00:34:29.688 --> 00:34:30.896
called Z Plus.

466
00:34:31.034 --> 00:34:33.485
Now that was before his
disappearance in 2019

467
00:34:33.623 --> 00:34:36.074
after the Russian mob reportedly
raided his laboratory.

468
00:34:36.212 --> 00:34:37.627
The police never found his body.

469
00:34:37.765 --> 00:34:39.111
and they've since
declared him dead.

470
00:34:39.249 --> 00:34:42.149
But this wouldn't be the
first time Dr. Tupple

471
00:34:42.287 --> 00:34:43.736
brought on this
type of controversy.

472
00:34:43.874 --> 00:34:45.083
See. two years earlier.

473
00:34:45.221 --> 00:34:46.912
he was declared dead
after being involved

474
00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:48.776
in the rescue of
a missing child.

475
00:34:48.914 --> 00:34:51.123
only to turn up six
months later unharmed.

476
00:34:51.261 --> 00:34:53.608
See. this has led several
people to theorize

477
00:34:53.746 --> 00:34:57.612
that Dr. Tupple is in fact
alive and is on the run

478
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:59.718
and is using the Z
Plus to stay ahead

479
00:34:59.856 --> 00:35:01.202
of those that are
looking for him.

480
00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:04.240
The pill is rumored to be
able to change the order

481
00:35:04.378 --> 00:35:07.588
in which our minds
perceive time and events.

482
00:35:07.726 --> 00:35:10.142
But this is where the facts
get a little bit less certain.

483
00:35:13.421 --> 00:35:14.733
Yeah. I know.

484
00:35:18.978 --> 00:35:21.188
We'll get him. don't worry.

485
00:35:35.029 --> 00:35:36.789
What do we have here?

486
00:35:38.515 --> 00:35:40.552
I think this
one's over the edge. boss.

487
00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:45.143
Stop! How many times
do I have to tell you?

488
00:35:45.281 --> 00:35:46.834
I don't wanna see their faces.

489
00:35:46.972 --> 00:35:48.111
You want
me to put it back on?

490
00:35:48.249 --> 00:35:51.666
No. cut him loose.
Wait in the car.

491
00:36:00.917 --> 00:36:03.782
Tell me. what seems
to be the matter?

492
00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.992
Nothing. nothing.
nothing at all.

493
00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:11.652
I made a stupid joke. and
George took me too seriously.

494
00:36:13.861 --> 00:36:17.209
Everything's good.
Sorry to hear that.

495
00:36:17.347 --> 00:36:21.179
If there is something
wrong. you could tell me.

496
00:36:26.529 --> 00:36:27.875
I'm trying to remember

497
00:36:28.013 --> 00:36:32.051
what happened even fucking
two minutes ago. and I can't.

498
00:36:33.225 --> 00:36:36.677
It's like two sides.
two competing memories.

499
00:36:40.198 --> 00:36:41.785
I'm so sorry.

500
00:36:48.309 --> 00:36:51.347
Look. man. I can't
take it anymore.

501
00:36:55.696 --> 00:36:58.906
Like cars crashing
together in my brain.

502
00:36:59.044 --> 00:37:01.149
I don't know what's
real anymore.

503
00:37:01.288 --> 00:37:03.531
I see. I have to ask you.

504
00:37:06.465 --> 00:37:10.055
Did you or did you not
do what I asked of you?

505
00:37:10.193 --> 00:37:13.576
I did. I did.

506
00:37:17.407 --> 00:37:20.755
Put the sack back
on your head. please.

507
00:37:45.608 --> 00:37:48.611
I need them to keep
things straight.

508
00:37:48.749 --> 00:37:52.511
Get some more Z serum
from one of the new guys.

509
00:38:08.113 --> 00:38:12.428
All right. what is this
really? Time travel pills?

510
00:38:13.877 --> 00:38:15.085
I mean. what are you trying
to sell me magic beans?

511
00:38:15.223 --> 00:38:17.295
You trying to get me to
pass 'em off to others?

512
00:38:17.433 --> 00:38:19.987
I'm trying to offer you a job.

513
00:38:20.125 --> 00:38:21.713
No. thank you.

514
00:38:21.851 --> 00:38:23.715
I did a little
research on you.

515
00:38:23.853 --> 00:38:27.201
You're in debt and
with the wrong people.

516
00:38:27.339 --> 00:38:29.168
I've been there
before. It sucks.

517
00:38:29.307 --> 00:38:33.518
I'm guessing now you're looking
for a way to start over.

518
00:38:33.656 --> 00:38:34.829
Okay. I'm gonna
humor you for a second

519
00:38:34.967 --> 00:38:36.797
and believe that this is real.

520
00:38:36.935 --> 00:38:38.419
Explain.

521
00:38:38.557 --> 00:38:42.458
On the paper's what
I'm offering for the job.

522
00:38:45.253 --> 00:38:49.465
Let's get coffee.

523
00:38:56.161 --> 00:38:57.473
No. no. no. no.
no. no. no. no.

524
00:38:57.611 --> 00:38:59.889
I mean. there are many
ways to get exposure.

525
00:39:00.027 --> 00:39:02.236
Well. that's what everyone
gets wrong. right?

526
00:39:02.374 --> 00:39:03.617
I mean. if everyone
was getting right.

527
00:39:03.755 --> 00:39:05.515
they we'd know about it. right?

528
00:39:05.653 --> 00:39:08.276
Okay.
Right. yeah.

529
00:39:08.415 --> 00:39:10.244
Okay. Well. you know. yeah.
I'm just leaving right now.

530
00:39:10.382 --> 00:39:11.556
Okay. I gotta go.

531
00:39:23.602 --> 00:39:27.606
Okay. consciousness
time trading. Just
walk me through it.

532
00:39:27.744 --> 00:39:28.435
Okay.

533
00:39:30.195 --> 00:39:32.231
Hey. miss. How you doing?

534
00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:33.716
You got a pen on you?

535
00:39:38.445 --> 00:39:39.273
Thanks.

536
00:39:40.447 --> 00:39:43.381
Okay. so we think of
time in a straight line.

537
00:39:43.519 --> 00:39:45.279
one road leading
from A to B. right?

538
00:39:45.417 --> 00:39:46.970
Let's start to think
of it as a map.

539
00:39:47.108 --> 00:39:51.389
The locations stay the same.
but the order and the route

540
00:39:51.527 --> 00:39:54.253
in which you hit
them can change.

541
00:40:00.121 --> 00:40:01.640
That's a pretty
high-tech case.

542
00:40:01.778 --> 00:40:03.504
Yeah. These pills are no joke.

543
00:40:03.642 --> 00:40:05.472
The wrong person tries
to open up this case.

544
00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:06.783
and it will burn their eye out.

545
00:40:06.921 --> 00:40:09.855
Jesus. And you just
gave me one in a bar?

546
00:40:09.993 --> 00:40:11.961
Relax. This is a fake.

547
00:40:13.963 --> 00:40:16.414
So do you have plans
tomorrow morning?

548
00:40:16.552 --> 00:40:17.656
Oh. yeah. I have a gig.

549
00:40:17.794 --> 00:40:19.762
I'm taking a midterm
for a trust fund baby.

550
00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:24.594
It's 9:00 AM. give or take.

551
00:40:24.732 --> 00:40:27.148
Let's say hypothetically
that you take the pill.

552
00:40:27.286 --> 00:40:29.634
the Z Plus. right now.

553
00:40:29.772 --> 00:40:31.981
When you take the pill.
you're gonna close your eyes.

554
00:40:32.119 --> 00:40:34.362
When you open them.
they're gonna be purple.

555
00:40:34.501 --> 00:40:36.813
That means you're
jumping forward.

556
00:40:36.951 --> 00:40:37.883
You should be right on campus.

557
00:40:38.021 --> 00:40:39.782
getting ready to take that test.

558
00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.611
Then they'll definitely
know something's up.

559
00:40:41.749 --> 00:40:44.062
but if I don't do well.
I'm gonna fucking fail.

560
00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.340
and my parents are
gonna fucking kill me.

561
00:40:46.478 --> 00:40:49.101
Wait. what happens to tomorrow
me when I'm in their body?

562
00:40:49.239 --> 00:40:51.863
Here's where it gets a
little more complicated.

563
00:40:52.001 --> 00:40:53.623
Let's go back to just
before your eyes went purple

564
00:40:53.761 --> 00:40:55.004
on campus.

565
00:40:55.142 --> 00:40:56.730
I really have
to do well on this

566
00:40:56.868 --> 00:40:59.353
because my parents are paying
full tuition. as you know.

567
00:40:59.491 --> 00:41:01.389
While you're jumping
forward from the day before.

568
00:41:01.528 --> 00:41:05.152
your tomorrow self is gonna
wake up in your body right now.

569
00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:06.981
Your eyes are gonna be green.

570
00:41:07.119 --> 00:41:08.845
That means you're
jumping backward.

571
00:41:08.983 --> 00:41:10.985
For the next hour.
tomorrow Sophia's gonna get

572
00:41:11.123 --> 00:41:14.023
to hang out here with
me at the coffee shop

573
00:41:14.161 --> 00:41:16.819
while today Sophia-
Will be in my body tomorrow.

574
00:41:16.957 --> 00:41:20.685
When the time runs
out. you'll switch back.

575
00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.999
That's how it works. basically.

576
00:41:25.137 --> 00:41:29.038
- Basically.
- Basically.

577
00:41:29.176 --> 00:41:32.248
The stuff was originally
concocted as a serum. Z.

578
00:41:32.386 --> 00:41:35.216
much more unpredictable.
much more dangerous.

579
00:41:35.354 --> 00:41:37.184
Eventually. it was refined
into the pill form.

580
00:41:37.322 --> 00:41:39.980
Z Plus. with a bit more control.

581
00:41:41.499 --> 00:41:43.846
But can't any little thing
change everything though.

582
00:41:43.984 --> 00:41:45.364
like the butterfly effect?

583
00:41:45.503 --> 00:41:48.402
Yeah. That's why we limit
the amount of variables.

584
00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:50.404
The less we know. the better.

585
00:41:50.542 --> 00:41:51.854
We don't know what
we're trying to steal.

586
00:41:51.992 --> 00:41:54.408
it makes it harder for
us to screw it all up.

587
00:41:54.546 --> 00:41:56.065
The team is made up
of three components.

588
00:41:56.203 --> 00:41:58.032
the sitter. the
tech. and the photog.

589
00:41:58.170 --> 00:41:59.620
The sitter. me. is in
charge of making sure

590
00:41:59.758 --> 00:42:01.519
that we don't lose our
minds by limiting the amount

591
00:42:01.657 --> 00:42:03.728
of variable. such
as the moving truck.

592
00:42:03.866 --> 00:42:05.177
making sure that we
have limited knowledge

593
00:42:05.315 --> 00:42:06.731
and administering the Z.

594
00:42:06.869 --> 00:42:08.526
The tech's job is to
plan the actual steal

595
00:42:08.664 --> 00:42:10.424
and manage the logistics.

596
00:42:10.562 --> 00:42:11.701
Lucky for us. we try
to steal information

597
00:42:11.839 --> 00:42:14.221
that has no significant
value on the day of

598
00:42:14.359 --> 00:42:17.431
but means a whole hell of a
lot if obtained the day before.

599
00:42:17.569 --> 00:42:20.227
Low risk. low
security. high reward.

600
00:42:20.365 --> 00:42:22.574
I see took the
decals off the van.

601
00:42:22.712 --> 00:42:25.197
How's it going?
You must be Sophia.

602
00:42:25.335 --> 00:42:28.062
I'm Finn.

603
00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:29.995
And I'm the new
photog. I'm assuming.

604
00:42:30.133 --> 00:42:31.445
Yep.

605
00:42:31.583 --> 00:42:33.102
We get you in. You remember
it when you come back.

606
00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:34.793
Do I wanna know what
happened to the other one?

607
00:42:34.931 --> 00:42:36.657
Before you
agree to anything.

608
00:42:36.795 --> 00:42:39.315
you should be aware that there
are certain dangers involved

609
00:42:39.453 --> 00:42:40.903
in what we do.

610
00:42:41.041 --> 00:42:42.939
When you steal from people.
sometimes they fight back.

611
00:42:43.077 --> 00:42:45.666
but above all else.
we follow my rules.

612
00:42:45.804 --> 00:42:48.151
We get in. we get
out. and we get paid.

613
00:42:48.289 --> 00:42:50.706
and then we're all on our own.

614
00:42:52.535 --> 00:42:53.950
What do you think?

615
00:42:57.057 --> 00:42:59.577
So what are we stealing?

616
00:42:59.715 --> 00:43:01.130
Finn.

617
00:43:01.268 --> 00:43:03.719
I have bad news
and I have good news.

618
00:43:03.857 --> 00:43:06.480
Our target is 14 account
numbers. 10 digits each.

619
00:43:06.618 --> 00:43:10.104
to be published and stored
in their records Thursday.

620
00:43:10.242 --> 00:43:12.555
I've omitted the name of the
company for obvious reasons.

621
00:43:12.693 --> 00:43:16.421
- 14 account numbers?
- It's a lot. You okay?

622
00:43:17.595 --> 00:43:18.768
Yeah.

623
00:43:18.906 --> 00:43:20.114
So the location is
a nightmare for us.

624
00:43:20.252 --> 00:43:21.288
Cameras everywhere at all times.

625
00:43:21.426 --> 00:43:22.738
security at every entrance.

626
00:43:22.876 --> 00:43:24.256
It's a non-starter and
with such a short runway

627
00:43:24.394 --> 00:43:27.466
for planning. even more of
a zero-chance operation.

628
00:43:27.605 --> 00:43:29.158
You said there was good news.

629
00:43:29.296 --> 00:43:30.435
Simon Willoughby.

630
00:43:30.573 --> 00:43:32.161
Technically. on their
staff he's a programmer.

631
00:43:32.299 --> 00:43:34.646
but in reality. he's a
go between for any large

632
00:43:34.784 --> 00:43:37.028
and less than ethical
deals for the company.

633
00:43:37.166 --> 00:43:38.650
Basically. he's the fall guy.

634
00:43:38.788 --> 00:43:41.411
No. no. no. no. I don't
need to know any of that. no.

635
00:43:41.549 --> 00:43:43.862
Just send me over the
details. I'll take care of it.

636
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.346
What's good for
us is that he works

637
00:43:45.484 --> 00:43:47.659
from his fancy upstate
chalet this time of year.

638
00:43:47.797 --> 00:43:49.488
Yeah. So I'm heading
north of the week.

639
00:43:49.627 --> 00:43:51.629
Yeah. yeah. you gotta
come check this place out

640
00:43:51.767 --> 00:43:53.147
and then we'll hang
out in the jacuzz.

641
00:43:53.285 --> 00:43:55.149
It'll be a great time.
Yeah. no. no. I'm good.

642
00:43:55.287 --> 00:43:56.979
Okay. yep. I'll give
you a quick call later.

643
00:43:57.117 --> 00:43:58.325
Bye bye.

644
00:43:58.463 --> 00:44:00.603
Place is nice. but
it's less than secure.

645
00:44:00.741 --> 00:44:01.846
Does seem. though. as of late.

646
00:44:01.984 --> 00:44:03.364
he's been going
through some stuff.

647
00:44:06.505 --> 00:44:08.162
It's easy to believe

648
00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:09.992
that just because
you're not currently

649
00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:14.272
where you want to be
spiritually and physically.

650
00:44:14.410 --> 00:44:19.104
you mustn't ever forget
that tomorrow is a new day.

651
00:44:19.242 --> 00:44:21.037
a day to be a new you.

652
00:44:22.245 --> 00:44:24.731
Repeat after me.
I am good enough.

653
00:44:27.147 --> 00:44:28.355
I am good enough.

654
00:44:28.493 --> 00:44:31.841
- I am worth it.
- I am worth it.

655
00:44:31.979 --> 00:44:34.533
- I have value.
- I have value.

656
00:44:36.121 --> 00:44:40.229
I am a good person.

657
00:44:40.367 --> 00:44:41.471
I am a good person.

658
00:44:41.609 --> 00:44:44.129
New
call from Todd Hamilton.

659
00:44:44.267 --> 00:44:46.891
Hey you! What can I do for ya?

660
00:44:47.029 --> 00:44:49.031
I'll have the numbers on
his computer Thursday morning.

661
00:44:49.169 --> 00:44:51.205
That gives us a very small
window of time to obtain them

662
00:44:51.343 --> 00:44:53.587
and get them to the organization
before our deadline.

663
00:44:53.725 --> 00:44:54.588
Any questions?

664
00:45:18.267 --> 00:45:20.718
Okay. So you know the plan.

665
00:45:20.856 --> 00:45:22.064
Unless shit hits the fan.

666
00:45:22.202 --> 00:45:23.824
we should wake up at location B.

667
00:45:23.962 --> 00:45:25.412
at which we'll infiltrate
through the pipeline

668
00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:26.896
to the main property.

669
00:45:27.034 --> 00:45:28.380
Then-

670
00:45:28.518 --> 00:45:29.761
Then it's a matter of
Simon chasing the delivery.

671
00:45:29.899 --> 00:45:31.970
The mail usually comes
around 9:30 or 10.

672
00:45:32.108 --> 00:45:34.421
Then we get in. we get
the target off the computer.

673
00:45:34.559 --> 00:45:36.906
and we get out undetected. copy?

674
00:45:37.044 --> 00:45:37.873
Copy.

675
00:45:39.944 --> 00:45:41.428
Word of advice. Sophia.

676
00:45:41.566 --> 00:45:46.295
The first time can feel a
little jolting. Don't fight it.

677
00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:05.866
How'd it go?

678
00:46:10.146 --> 00:46:13.529
You get used to it.

679
00:46:13.667 --> 00:46:15.462
Quarter mile into those
woods is the drainage pipe.

680
00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:18.637
That'll take you to
Simon's backyard.

681
00:46:21.261 --> 00:46:22.089
You good?

682
00:46:24.782 --> 00:46:27.854
I'm good.

683
00:46:28.751 --> 00:46:29.614
See you soon.

684
00:47:13.934 --> 00:47:15.142
All right. Lee.
give me an update.

685
00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:16.868
We're good. We're
almost at the spot.

686
00:47:31.055 --> 00:47:32.539
That's a go. Finn.

687
00:48:14.098 --> 00:48:14.892
Hello?

688
00:48:17.066 --> 00:48:17.895
Hi.

689
00:48:22.623 --> 00:48:23.452
Hello!

690
00:48:24.902 --> 00:48:26.558
You're up. you two.

691
00:48:37.259 --> 00:48:39.744
Where are you going?

692
00:48:42.747 --> 00:48:44.714
- Finn. it's locked.
- Can you pick it?

693
00:48:44.852 --> 00:48:46.924
Yeah. sure. Stand back.

694
00:48:50.134 --> 00:48:53.896
I said pick
it. not kick it. Lee.

695
00:49:00.247 --> 00:49:01.214
Well. how'd you
learn to do that?

696
00:49:01.352 --> 00:49:02.940
Don't wanna know.

697
00:49:07.703 --> 00:49:09.325
Come on. come on.

698
00:49:09.463 --> 00:49:11.327
The fuck. Right here!

699
00:49:17.609 --> 00:49:19.715
The email's not here.

700
00:49:19.853 --> 00:49:22.062
- Finn. the email's not there.
- Should've been there at 10.

701
00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:23.581
Well. it's not.

702
00:49:23.719 --> 00:49:25.065
Well. if it's not
there. it's coming soon.

703
00:49:25.203 --> 00:49:28.517
Well. we don't really have
that kind of time. Finn.

704
00:49:28.655 --> 00:49:30.829
- Wait. it just came in.
- Let's go.

705
00:49:30.968 --> 00:49:33.660
Well. give me
a couple seconds.

706
00:49:39.942 --> 00:49:42.634
All right. time's
up. Let's go.

707
00:49:48.502 --> 00:49:50.125
Okay. got it.

708
00:49:50.263 --> 00:49:53.162
- Lee. we got company.
- Who?

709
00:49:54.577 --> 00:49:57.201
Yeah. yeah. right here.
Bring it back. yeah.

710
00:49:57.339 --> 00:49:58.616
Drive away and then come back.

711
00:49:58.754 --> 00:50:00.859
Right. bring it
right fucking here.

712
00:50:04.449 --> 00:50:05.278
Shit!

713
00:50:10.869 --> 00:50:13.872
What do we do?
Go. minimal impact.

714
00:50:19.361 --> 00:50:22.812
Get off of me. Get
the fuck off of me!

715
00:50:25.263 --> 00:50:28.059
Whatever it is. it's another
deal. I can get you details.

716
00:50:28.197 --> 00:50:29.336
We're going.

717
00:50:30.924 --> 00:50:31.752
Hi.

718
00:50:31.890 --> 00:50:32.960
I don't know who you are.

719
00:50:33.099 --> 00:50:34.617
but I can fix whatever
the fuck it is.

720
00:50:34.755 --> 00:50:37.034
Sh. I know. Are you alone?

721
00:50:38.863 --> 00:50:40.416
This is my place. I'm alone.

722
00:50:40.554 --> 00:50:42.763
I'm always fucking alone. Okay?

723
00:50:47.113 --> 00:50:49.598
- Kill him.
- Please. please don't!

724
00:50:49.736 --> 00:50:50.909
I can get you whatever you want.

725
00:50:51.048 --> 00:50:52.394
I can do whatever you want.

726
00:50:52.532 --> 00:50:54.948
I know some very. very
powerful. very rich people.

727
00:50:55.086 --> 00:50:58.469
I can make whatever it is
that you want to have happen.

728
00:50:58.607 --> 00:51:00.816
I'm just trying to actually
be a little bit better

729
00:51:00.954 --> 00:51:02.369
of a person.

730
00:51:02.507 --> 00:51:06.097
I'm just not quite there yet.
I can't die right now. Okay?

731
00:51:06.235 --> 00:51:07.064
Please.

732
00:51:20.077 --> 00:51:23.252
See. I knew you weren't alone.

733
00:51:34.401 --> 00:51:35.506
Go with her.

734
00:51:42.478 --> 00:51:45.102
Who are you. you son of a bitch?

735
00:52:04.776 --> 00:52:05.881
Who are you?

736
00:52:06.813 --> 00:52:09.471
Hi. Lee.

737
00:52:09.609 --> 00:52:10.713
Answer!

738
00:52:15.132 --> 00:52:15.960
Answer!

739
00:52:32.632 --> 00:52:33.460
Hey.

740
00:52:40.847 --> 00:52:42.435
What happened to
minimal impact. Lee?

741
00:52:42.573 --> 00:52:43.988
What the fuck is going on?

742
00:52:44.126 --> 00:52:46.232
Lee. where are
you? Lee. answer me.

743
00:52:50.822 --> 00:52:51.616
Fucker.

744
00:52:54.723 --> 00:52:56.483
I'm here. I'm here.

745
00:52:56.621 --> 00:52:58.175
Find a safe spot off the road.

746
00:52:58.313 --> 00:53:00.246
Drive some. I'll meet you there.

747
00:53:00.384 --> 00:53:01.350
I think we're being followed.

748
00:53:01.488 --> 00:53:02.731
- You think?
- No shit!

749
00:53:02.869 --> 00:53:04.215
- No. different follower.
- You know what?

750
00:53:04.353 --> 00:53:06.321
You can just pull over
right here and I'll get out.

751
00:53:06.459 --> 00:53:08.702
Thank you so much for saving
me. I really do appreciate it.

752
00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:11.291
Lee. were those the same
guys that killed Martin?

753
00:53:11.429 --> 00:53:13.569
- I don't know!
- Who's Martin?

754
00:53:22.233 --> 00:53:23.200
- Get out.
- What do you mean get out?

755
00:53:23.338 --> 00:53:24.166
Get out!

756
00:53:25.409 --> 00:53:27.204
- 15 seconds.
- We'll be back tomorrow.

757
00:53:27.342 --> 00:53:29.102
- Tomorrow?
- 11 Seconds.

758
00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:31.035
- What?
- Seven seconds.

759
00:53:31.173 --> 00:53:32.416
- Until what?
- Ready?

760
00:53:44.186 --> 00:53:44.945
Where are we?

761
00:53:45.083 --> 00:53:46.947
Why are we at your place. Lee?

762
00:53:47.085 --> 00:53:48.777
- I don't know.
- Why aren't we in the truck?

763
00:53:48.915 --> 00:53:49.812
Because we clearly
left the truck

764
00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:51.814
after we jumped backwards.

765
00:53:51.952 --> 00:53:54.127
- Fuck! The Z's gone.
- What do you mean?

766
00:53:54.265 --> 00:53:56.854
I mean it's gone. everything.

767
00:53:59.201 --> 00:54:00.582
Okay. Let's recap.

768
00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:02.135
We were in the
truck and took a Z.

769
00:54:02.273 --> 00:54:04.793
Our tomorrow selves occupied
our bodies for the next hour.

770
00:54:04.931 --> 00:54:06.795
During that hour. they somehow
got us to your trailer.

771
00:54:06.933 --> 00:54:08.624
and the Z was stolen.

772
00:54:08.762 --> 00:54:10.005
Maybe the driver
brought us here

773
00:54:10.143 --> 00:54:11.903
and forced you to
hand over the Z.

774
00:54:12.041 --> 00:54:13.146
It wasn't the driver.

775
00:54:13.284 --> 00:54:14.872
We were being followed
since the beginning.

776
00:54:15.010 --> 00:54:16.770
- Yeah. no shit.
- No. there was another car.

777
00:54:16.908 --> 00:54:18.841
It looked like your car.

778
00:54:20.326 --> 00:54:22.017
Is someone gonna explain how
we got out of a moving truck?

779
00:54:22.155 --> 00:54:25.883
Yeah. How did we get
out of the truck. Lee?

780
00:54:28.368 --> 00:54:29.749
Jesus Christ. I knew it.

781
00:54:29.887 --> 00:54:30.819
There's an eye scanner in
the truck. isn't there?

782
00:54:30.957 --> 00:54:32.096
But the truck is moving?

783
00:54:32.234 --> 00:54:32.959
You have all these
rules that everyone has

784
00:54:33.097 --> 00:54:34.132
to follow except for you.

785
00:54:34.271 --> 00:54:35.651
It's for emergencies.

786
00:54:35.789 --> 00:54:37.515
Listen. we could've just
decided to come back here.

787
00:54:37.653 --> 00:54:40.207
hide Z from whoever it
is before they got to it.

788
00:54:40.346 --> 00:54:42.002
Okay. Where would you hide it?

789
00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:43.383
I don't know. It
could be anywhere.

790
00:54:43.521 --> 00:54:44.488
Like here?

791
00:54:46.110 --> 00:54:47.007
- Stop.
- What?

792
00:54:47.145 --> 00:54:48.664
- Don't look.
- Why?

793
00:54:48.802 --> 00:54:49.976
If you look and
it's not there.

794
00:54:50.114 --> 00:54:51.667
then we can't come back
tomorrow and hide it.

795
00:54:51.805 --> 00:54:53.462
- Schrodinger's cat.
- Whose cat?

796
00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:54.636
Schrodinger's cat.

797
00:54:54.774 --> 00:54:56.534
It's an idea about
paradoxes and realities.

798
00:54:56.672 --> 00:54:57.846
Say you have a box
with a cat in it

799
00:54:57.984 --> 00:54:59.537
and you don't know if
it's alive or dead.

800
00:54:59.675 --> 00:55:00.814
Before you look inside the box.

801
00:55:00.952 --> 00:55:02.264
it's actually both
alive and dead.

802
00:55:02.402 --> 00:55:04.473
Either reality could be true.

803
00:55:04.611 --> 00:55:05.854
Once you look inside
the box. though.

804
00:55:05.992 --> 00:55:09.375
we're committed to that version.

805
00:55:09.513 --> 00:55:12.688
So the Z is both behind the
panel and not behind the panel?

806
00:55:12.826 --> 00:55:15.104
Mm-hmm.

807
00:55:15.242 --> 00:55:19.177
- Okay. so what do we do?
- We stick to the plan.

808
00:55:19.316 --> 00:55:22.802
Tomorrow. we drive to
Simon's cabin. park the car.

809
00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:24.424
We jump backwards into
the truck. we come here.

810
00:55:24.562 --> 00:55:27.979
we hide the Z behind the
panel. wake up in the woods.

811
00:55:28.117 --> 00:55:33.053
deal with Simon. and then we
are having beers by dinner.

812
00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:35.746
- And what about the job?
- And your car?

813
00:55:35.884 --> 00:55:39.819
I'll figure it out.
Do you have the numbers?

814
00:55:39.957 --> 00:55:40.751
Yeah.

815
00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:47.067
Finn. may I please
have the keys to the van?

816
00:55:54.281 --> 00:55:56.042
Better get us paid.

817
00:55:57.906 --> 00:55:59.701
It is gonna be fine.

818
00:56:06.708 --> 00:56:08.917
Fuck!
It's gonna be fine.

819
00:56:34.183 --> 00:56:35.599
I'm sorry.

820
00:56:35.737 --> 00:56:39.637
The liquid sample you provided
to us is just very unstable.

821
00:56:39.775 --> 00:56:42.916
We're getting closer.
but it's not ready yet.

822
00:56:43.054 --> 00:56:44.849
Do you understand what
this is. Dr. Muller?

823
00:56:44.987 --> 00:56:48.163
This is spatial
temporal neuroscience.

824
00:56:48.301 --> 00:56:50.130
and it's extremely complicated.

825
00:56:50.268 --> 00:56:54.790
Wrong. This is a race.
a race for the future.

826
00:56:54.928 --> 00:56:57.793
Do you understand?
I do.

827
00:56:57.931 --> 00:56:58.656
Keep working.

828
00:57:05.249 --> 00:57:06.802
Is Danny here?

829
00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:07.976
He's out there
trying to find somebody

830
00:57:08.114 --> 00:57:10.081
to buy that stupid boat.

831
00:57:13.257 --> 00:57:14.603
Everything okay?

832
00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:19.332
Our brains have already
established a timeline

833
00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:21.817
in which we wake up at my place.

834
00:57:21.955 --> 00:57:23.198
So if we wake up anywhere else.

835
00:57:23.336 --> 00:57:24.820
our brains aren't gonna
know which timeline

836
00:57:24.958 --> 00:57:26.339
is the right one.

837
00:57:28.410 --> 00:57:30.274
I still don't
understand the blindfolds.

838
00:57:30.412 --> 00:57:32.103
It can be very
tempting to want

839
00:57:32.241 --> 00:57:34.830
to try and change your
past. even only for a day.

840
00:57:34.968 --> 00:57:36.522
If we don't know where
we are when we go back.

841
00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:38.385
it makes it a lot
tougher to change things

842
00:57:38.524 --> 00:57:41.699
than lose total
grip on our reality.

843
00:57:41.837 --> 00:57:43.874
This
shit's complicated.

844
00:57:44.012 --> 00:57:46.014
Now you're telling me.

845
00:57:46.152 --> 00:57:47.878
So be honest.

846
00:57:48.016 --> 00:57:49.845
When you get to the truck.

847
00:57:49.983 --> 00:57:54.125
do you. Lee Warner. really
not know where you are?

848
00:57:59.579 --> 00:58:00.822
You still in love with Finn?

849
00:58:03.825 --> 00:58:06.344
How's she doing?
She's good.

850
00:58:08.830 --> 00:58:11.384
I gotta finish closing.
You good to go home?

851
00:58:11.522 --> 00:58:15.871
- Yeah. I got Finn's van.
- What happened to your car?

852
00:58:17.010 --> 00:58:21.152
Honestly. I don't
know.

853
00:58:22.671 --> 00:58:27.400
Well. good luck tomorrow or
today or I don't fucking know.

854
00:58:49.871 --> 00:58:50.906
Hello. anybody?

855
00:58:52.839 --> 00:58:56.947
- Hi there.
- Whoa. shit.

856
00:58:57.085 --> 00:58:58.224
You scared me.

857
00:58:59.363 --> 00:59:00.191
Sorry.

858
00:59:02.055 --> 00:59:05.680
Would you like to join
me for another drink?

859
00:59:08.234 --> 00:59:10.547
I think the bar's closing.

860
00:59:24.561 --> 00:59:27.011
Maybe we can go
somewhere else.

861
00:59:27.149 --> 00:59:29.704
somewhere more private perhaps.

862
00:59:31.050 --> 00:59:32.189
Yeah. maybe.

863
00:59:36.434 --> 00:59:38.713
I see pain in your eyes. Lee.

864
00:59:45.133 --> 00:59:48.101
- I've had my eye on you.
- Okay!

865
00:59:48.239 --> 00:59:50.483
I have a secret.
Can I share it?

866
00:59:50.621 --> 00:59:52.002
Look. this is really great.

867
00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:55.453
but I think that you think
that I'm somebody else.

868
00:59:55.592 --> 00:59:58.146
Don't fight it. Lee.

869
00:59:59.941 --> 01:00:02.115
Fuck was that?

870
01:00:02.253 --> 01:00:04.462
Don't fight it. Lee.

871
01:00:22.446 --> 01:00:23.309
It's a
pleasure to finally talk

872
01:00:23.447 --> 01:00:25.207
to you. Mr. Warner.

873
01:00:25.345 --> 01:00:27.658
What is this?
What is going on?

874
01:00:27.796 --> 01:00:28.970
You've been injected

875
01:00:29.108 --> 01:00:30.350
with the consciousness
communications device.

876
01:00:30.488 --> 01:00:31.869
I just spoke with
my representative.

877
01:00:32.007 --> 01:00:33.181
and I would love
to discuss how you

878
01:00:33.319 --> 01:00:35.632
and I can improve our
working relationship.

879
01:00:35.770 --> 01:00:37.530
How about a fucking
phone call. man?

880
01:00:37.668 --> 01:00:40.878
Lee. I took the privilege of
looking at your profile here.

881
01:00:41.016 --> 01:00:42.673
Arrested seven times.

882
01:00:44.502 --> 01:00:48.368
Robbery. fraud. I mean.
the list goes on and on.

883
01:00:48.506 --> 01:00:50.647
I'm also reading here
that you've got one

884
01:00:50.785 --> 01:00:52.269
of your team members killed.

885
01:00:52.407 --> 01:00:56.514
Such a pity. but
nevertheless. you carry on.

886
01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:59.379
You seem quite strong willed.

887
01:00:59.517 --> 01:01:03.038
I'm also strong willed.
Where's our money?

888
01:01:03.176 --> 01:01:05.903
Lee. the organization needs
your help. and quite frankly.

889
01:01:06.041 --> 01:01:09.562
we had the organization do not
like to get our hands dirty.

890
01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:11.219
And it would be such
a terrible shame

891
01:01:11.357 --> 01:01:14.671
if something were to happen
to one of your people.

892
01:01:14.809 --> 01:01:16.327
again. that is.

893
01:01:18.019 --> 01:01:19.434
Look. Lee. let's not
have another death due

894
01:01:19.572 --> 01:01:22.195
to your pride. shall we?

895
01:01:22.333 --> 01:01:24.059
If you reconsider the
offer of helping us.

896
01:01:24.197 --> 01:01:27.891
you can find another microchip
in your left jacket pocket.

897
01:01:28.029 --> 01:01:29.927
You know what to do.

898
01:01:53.433 --> 01:01:54.262
Once we're back in the truck.

899
01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:55.470
we'll have one hour to get out.

900
01:01:55.608 --> 01:01:56.989
take the van to my
place. and hide the Z.

901
01:01:57.127 --> 01:01:58.335
What
happens if we don't?

902
01:01:58.473 --> 01:02:00.337
- Nothing good.
- Lee. again.

903
01:02:00.475 --> 01:02:02.891
remind me how this is
supposed to get us paid.

904
01:02:03.029 --> 01:02:04.513
Five seconds.

905
01:02:04.651 --> 01:02:09.035
- I have a contingency plan.
- Of course you do.

906
01:02:09.173 --> 01:02:10.416
See you in the truck.

907
01:02:16.525 --> 01:02:17.354
Lee?

908
01:02:24.292 --> 01:02:26.294
Lee. the truck is moving.

909
01:02:31.506 --> 01:02:34.405
Guessing you don't
have one for us?

910
01:02:35.959 --> 01:02:39.169
Not gonna be needing
one. Stand back.

911
01:02:43.967 --> 01:02:47.315
- Now what are you gonna do?
- Improvise.

912
01:02:54.425 --> 01:02:56.117
Lee. what the fuck?

We need to hide the Z and
leave everything else exactly

922
01:04:41.256 --> 01:04:42.637
how we found it.
Hey guys.

923
01:04:42.775 --> 01:04:44.432
we need to hide the Z and
leave everything else exactly

924
01:04:44.570 --> 01:04:45.882
how we found it.

925
01:04:47.676 --> 01:04:48.505
Got it.

926
01:04:50.748 --> 01:04:55.098
Wait. This was open yesterday.
Because we opened it.

927
01:05:05.625 --> 01:05:07.006
Oh no. no. Remember.
leave it off.

928
01:05:07.144 --> 01:05:09.802
That's how we found it when
we woke up here yesterday.

929
01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:12.356
Right. the fucking cabinet.

930
01:05:13.254 --> 01:05:14.220
Positions.

931
01:05:19.191 --> 01:05:21.434
How we doing for time?
Five minutes.

932
01:05:21.572 --> 01:05:22.608
And we were in
these spots. right?

933
01:05:22.746 --> 01:05:25.093
Yeah. I think I was over here.

934
01:05:25.231 --> 01:05:26.992
Something's not right.

935
01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:29.684
- We're ahead of schedule?
- I hope so.

936
01:05:39.901 --> 01:05:41.454
Shit! Everybody inside!

937
01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:56.849
I know you're in
there. Come out.

938
01:05:59.024 --> 01:06:01.233
You have something that I want.

939
01:06:01.371 --> 01:06:03.821
I was thinking perhaps
we can make a trade.

940
01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:06.824
I have something
that you may want.

941
01:06:14.729 --> 01:06:16.351
You have 10 seconds!

942
01:06:24.290 --> 01:06:26.189
10. nine. eight. seven.

943
01:06:28.777 --> 01:06:30.987
six. five. four. tres. dos!

944
01:06:33.368 --> 01:06:34.197
I'm here!

945
01:06:37.027 --> 01:06:38.684
There he is.

946
01:06:44.414 --> 01:06:45.346
Who are you?

947
01:06:46.554 --> 01:06:51.076
Those eyes. See. we're
not so different. Lee.

948
01:06:51.214 --> 01:06:52.939
I was just a few
years too early.

949
01:06:53.078 --> 01:06:54.596
What's your
experience right now?

950
01:06:54.734 --> 01:06:56.426
Think about
what that first batch

951
01:06:56.564 --> 01:07:01.189
of serum was like. your
own memories becoming lies.

952
01:07:01.327 --> 01:07:03.709
It's hard to describe.

953
01:07:03.847 --> 01:07:05.400
You become powerless.

954
01:07:05.538 --> 01:07:08.576
- You see. your mind is.
- Small.

955
01:07:10.164 --> 01:07:13.960
It's pretty quite
fascinating. isn't it?

956
01:07:14.099 --> 01:07:18.379
An entire galaxy of moments
living inside our minds.

957
01:07:19.863 --> 01:07:23.246
With that being said. I prefer
to live in the here and now.

958
01:07:23.384 --> 01:07:24.557
Whenever you wake up tomorrow.

959
01:07:24.695 --> 01:07:28.389
your friend here can
either be dead or alive.

960
01:07:30.218 --> 01:07:33.152
but you probably already
know what happens.

961
01:07:33.290 --> 01:07:37.605
As we both know. we can
always change things. right?

962
01:07:43.438 --> 01:07:46.372
- Now go.
- I'll see you soon. Lee.

963
01:08:01.629 --> 01:08:03.424
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

964
01:08:07.462 --> 01:08:09.671
I'm-
Sorry. Finn. Time?

965
01:08:11.811 --> 01:08:13.537
30 seconds.

966
01:08:13.675 --> 01:08:14.883
I know the way
this is gonna sound.

967
01:08:15.021 --> 01:08:16.471
but I need you to go.
What?

968
01:08:16.609 --> 01:08:17.955
We're about to wake up here.

969
01:08:18.094 --> 01:08:20.993
If he's here when we do.
we're gonna lose total grip.

970
01:08:21.131 --> 01:08:22.098
I need you to go right now.

971
01:08:22.236 --> 01:08:23.271
- Okay. what the fuck?
- Sophia!

972
01:08:23.409 --> 01:08:26.067
- 15 seconds.
- Take it and go. Okay?

973
01:08:26.205 --> 01:08:27.310
You're welcome to follow us.

974
01:08:27.448 --> 01:08:28.518
but don't let us
know you're there.

975
01:08:28.656 --> 01:08:29.691
I'll see you at
this time tomorrow.

976
01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:31.141
- Five seconds.
- Positions.

977
01:08:36.146 --> 01:08:37.665
Three. two. one.

978
01:08:42.290 --> 01:08:46.984
So I'm gonna ask again. What
the fuck is going on. huh?

979
01:08:56.684 --> 01:08:57.995
I am so sorry.

980
01:08:59.721 --> 01:09:01.171
Okay. All right.

981
01:09:05.175 --> 01:09:07.246
Who's this?
I'm Sophia.

982
01:09:08.696 --> 01:09:12.044
- Nice to meet ya.
- It's nice to meet you. too.

983
01:09:27.818 --> 01:09:29.303
His name is Derrick Volkov.

984
01:09:29.441 --> 01:09:31.477
He's a Russian mobster
was. for some reason.

985
01:09:31.615 --> 01:09:34.480
hired to obtain the
full supply of Z Plus.

986
01:09:34.618 --> 01:09:35.757
He's hired mercenaries
to take the Z

987
01:09:35.895 --> 01:09:37.794
and jump so he doesn't have to.

988
01:09:37.932 --> 01:09:40.935
I'm confused. We saw you die.

989
01:09:41.073 --> 01:09:45.077
Not quite. I didn't make
it out the first time.

990
01:09:45.215 --> 01:09:46.182
I was told.

991
01:09:50.255 --> 01:09:52.636
They kept me just
barely alive long enough

992
01:09:52.774 --> 01:09:54.397
for them to undo it.

993
01:10:03.578 --> 01:10:04.993
They can fuck with
events on his behalf

994
01:10:05.131 --> 01:10:06.926
without him having to
know their identities.

995
01:10:07.064 --> 01:10:08.721
Then when they
start to go crazy.

996
01:10:08.859 --> 01:10:12.208
lose their grip on reality.
they're disposed of.

997
01:10:12.346 --> 01:10:16.142
- Do you know who hired him?
- I don't.

998
01:10:16.281 --> 01:10:19.767
I do. Derrick Volkov
is a client of mine.

999
01:10:21.217 --> 01:10:23.011
I've never met him until today.

1000
01:10:23.149 --> 01:10:24.289
Go on.

1001
01:10:24.427 --> 01:10:26.083
Untie me and tell
me what's going on.

1002
01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:29.535
and then yeah.
maybe I will go on.

1003
01:10:31.710 --> 01:10:34.540
He's a client by name only.

1004
01:10:34.678 --> 01:10:36.577
Actually. they have a very
large transaction scheduled

1005
01:10:36.715 --> 01:10:38.268
for this week.
How big?

1006
01:10:38.406 --> 01:10:39.787
Big. like 100 million.

1007
01:10:39.925 --> 01:10:41.823
Derrick's selling over
the Z that we handed to him?

1008
01:10:41.961 --> 01:10:43.273
What do you do exactly?

1009
01:10:43.411 --> 01:10:45.275
I'm a programmer
for a crypto company.

1010
01:10:45.413 --> 01:10:47.519
I facilitate large transfers
with guaranteed anonymity.

1011
01:10:47.657 --> 01:10:48.830
no questions asked.

1012
01:10:48.968 --> 01:10:49.969
So you help the
crooks get paid.

1013
01:10:50.107 --> 01:10:51.661
Crooks like you.

1014
01:10:51.799 --> 01:10:53.490
It's the future.
just as good as cash

1015
01:10:53.628 --> 01:10:55.285
and completely untraceable.

1016
01:10:55.423 --> 01:10:58.184
You know. I'm gonna
be killed for this.

1017
01:10:58.323 --> 01:10:59.841
I'm in too deep. and I know
too much with these guys.

1018
01:10:59.979 --> 01:11:02.016
so I really hope that you
guys can do something.

1019
01:11:02.154 --> 01:11:05.191
I've seen the trades
this company's made.

1020
01:11:05.330 --> 01:11:06.848
They're after something big.

1021
01:11:06.986 --> 01:11:08.988
I know based on everything
you guys know about me.

1022
01:11:09.126 --> 01:11:11.301
I'm a total piece of shit.

1023
01:11:12.509 --> 01:11:15.063
I get that. but I've
really been trying

1024
01:11:15.201 --> 01:11:17.307
to actually be a better person.

1025
01:11:17.445 --> 01:11:19.102
So that in the case
that I do bow out.

1026
01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:20.759
I'd like to go out as a
slightly smaller piece

1027
01:11:20.897 --> 01:11:23.520
of shit than I am now.
What are you saying?

1028
01:11:23.658 --> 01:11:27.524
What I am saying is that
they're on a different level.

1029
01:11:27.662 --> 01:11:32.288
They wanna control everything.
full market manipulation.

1030
01:11:33.530 --> 01:11:36.188
So I don't know if you
all are the good guys

1031
01:11:36.326 --> 01:11:38.880
or the bad guys.
but it seems to me

1032
01:11:39.018 --> 01:11:42.953
that you're all my best
chance of staying alive

1033
01:11:44.196 --> 01:11:45.991
and to start being
a better person.

1034
01:11:46.129 --> 01:11:50.754
Appreciate that sentiment.
The problem is we're all dead.

1035
01:11:50.892 --> 01:11:53.205
We have no Z. so no
matter what we do.

1036
01:11:53.343 --> 01:11:56.691
they'll always be
a day ahead of us.

1037
01:12:03.733 --> 01:12:05.010
What the fuck is Z?

1038
01:12:16.159 --> 01:12:20.059
- Stop flexing.
- I'm not.

1039
01:12:20.197 --> 01:12:22.717
I'm starting to have
that feeling again.

1040
01:12:22.855 --> 01:12:24.581
- That we should be dead?
- Why aren't we?

1041
01:12:24.719 --> 01:12:25.824
They have our Z.

1042
01:12:25.962 --> 01:12:28.171
Because they want
something else.

1043
01:12:28.309 --> 01:12:29.448
Like more Z?

1044
01:12:34.902 --> 01:12:36.938
- No.
- Do you know where he is?

1045
01:12:37.076 --> 01:12:39.078
- No. Nobody does.
- Lee.

1046
01:12:40.735 --> 01:12:43.635
Fine. He may have
reached out a couple times.

1047
01:12:43.773 --> 01:12:45.291
That could be the 100
million dollar transaction.

1048
01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:46.603
Finn. no.

1049
01:12:46.741 --> 01:12:47.846
The only way to
protect ourselves

1050
01:12:47.984 --> 01:12:49.399
from these guys is to
get more Z from Jay.

1051
01:12:49.537 --> 01:12:50.883
But that's exactly
what we want.

1052
01:12:51.021 --> 01:12:55.543
and as soon as we lead
them. there they'll kill us.

1053
01:12:55.681 --> 01:12:57.787
Unless we make a plan.

1054
01:12:59.271 --> 01:13:00.445
So again. where are we going?

1055
01:13:02.447 --> 01:13:05.104
His name's Jay. He's the cook.

1056
01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:10.282
- Something wrong?
- Hmm?

1057
01:13:11.939 --> 01:13:14.700
We have a bit of a
complicated history.

1058
01:13:14.838 --> 01:13:17.323
He used to pay me cash
to test out the Z Plus.

1059
01:13:17.462 --> 01:13:21.017
and I haven't seen him since.
Since when?

1060
01:13:23.226 --> 01:13:24.330
Since I stole it from him.

1061
01:13:32.477 --> 01:13:33.547
So I know I've been
asking this a lot.

1062
01:13:33.685 --> 01:13:34.824
but where are we going?

1063
01:13:34.962 --> 01:13:36.998
- Jay's.
- Oh. right.

1064
01:13:37.136 --> 01:13:38.655
He's the one who
invented the stuff.

1065
01:13:38.793 --> 01:13:41.106
- The time travel pills?
- Yep.

1066
01:13:41.244 --> 01:13:44.937
- Have you met this guy?
- No. Lee has.

1067
01:13:45.075 --> 01:13:47.699
So. like time travel. Wow.

1068
01:13:47.837 --> 01:13:50.495
Can someone just please explain
to me how all this works?

1069
01:13:53.118 --> 01:13:53.946
Fine.

1070
01:13:57.502 --> 01:13:59.780
So are you and the guy
with the 'stache a thing?

1071
01:13:59.918 --> 01:14:02.403
I mean. are you
married or something?

1072
01:14:02.541 --> 01:14:03.784
I mean. it seem like you guys
are really hitting it off.

1073
01:14:03.922 --> 01:14:06.545
It's called CTT.

We're outta Z. on the run.
and they have the supply.

1094
01:14:48.207 --> 01:14:51.245
And that's why I
stopped producing.

1095
01:14:51.383 --> 01:14:53.730
You and I both know
you keep doing this.

1096
01:14:53.868 --> 01:14:56.181
you'll end up dead or worse.

1097
01:14:57.182 --> 01:14:58.010
So.

1098
01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:01.669
Can you help us out?

1099
01:15:03.533 --> 01:15:06.398
- Maybe.
- What do you want?

1100
01:15:06.536 --> 01:15:07.882
I don't want anything.

1101
01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:12.646
You know. we're not all
into this for personal gain.

1102
01:15:13.543 --> 01:15:14.613
Plus. I only have one pill left.

1103
01:15:14.751 --> 01:15:16.166
That's it?

1104
01:15:16.304 --> 01:15:21.033
Well that and some
newly created muscle relaxers.

1105
01:15:23.277 --> 01:15:25.313
What's wrong with 'em?

1106
01:15:26.383 --> 01:15:27.971
They'll kill you.

1107
01:15:41.019 --> 01:15:42.779
Lee was kind enough to
give me some of his clothes.

1108
01:15:42.917 --> 01:15:46.162
No shit. You look like
Tommy Bahama fucked a wet dog.

1109
01:15:52.306 --> 01:15:55.930
So how long have you
known the other guys?

1110
01:15:59.624 --> 01:16:00.694
Need you guys
to jump in the van

1111
01:16:00.832 --> 01:16:02.005
and put these sensors
down on any roadways

1112
01:16:02.143 --> 01:16:04.456
that connect to here
within five miles.

1113
01:16:04.594 --> 01:16:06.907
They come early. we'll know.

1114
01:16:11.497 --> 01:16:14.397
Sophia's idea. and
a good one. too.

1115
01:16:26.996 --> 01:16:30.931
So what are you going to do
when this is all done. huh?

1116
01:16:31.069 --> 01:16:32.967
I haven't
thought that far.

1117
01:16:33.105 --> 01:16:34.590
You gotta
keep running forever?

1118
01:16:34.728 --> 01:16:37.213
I haven't thought about it.

1119
01:16:41.666 --> 01:16:44.082
I am so sorry what I
did to you and the others.

1120
01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:47.741
Save it. Jay.

1121
01:16:47.879 --> 01:16:51.330
- No. I was selfish.
- Selfish? You think?

1122
01:16:54.506 --> 01:16:57.613
You understand the up
things that you used to do?

1123
01:16:57.751 --> 01:17:00.616
Recruiting desperate
people like me?

1124
01:17:01.858 --> 01:17:03.791
I thought I was acting
in the name of science.

1125
01:17:03.929 --> 01:17:06.414
I told you all about my
brother. how sick he was.

1126
01:17:06.552 --> 01:17:10.246
He was my only family.
and I would do anything

1127
01:17:10.384 --> 01:17:13.387
that I needed to
to help him out.

1128
01:17:13.525 --> 01:17:16.148
And you never even
seemed to care. Jay.

1129
01:17:16.286 --> 01:17:18.495
Every time we jumped.

1130
01:17:18.634 --> 01:17:22.258
we lost a little bit of
our connection to reality.

1131
01:17:22.396 --> 01:17:24.432
I know. It's just that
when you took the Z-

1132
01:17:24.570 --> 01:17:25.986
When I took the Z.

1133
01:17:26.124 --> 01:17:27.746
that's because that was the
quickest thing that I could do

1134
01:17:27.884 --> 01:17:30.715
to get my brother the
money that he needed.

1135
01:17:30.853 --> 01:17:33.510
And how did all that work out?

1136
01:17:34.477 --> 01:17:35.858
I went too far.

1137
01:17:36.962 --> 01:17:37.998
Eventually. I
couldn't differentiate

1138
01:17:38.136 --> 01:17:40.966
between what happened
and what didn't.

1139
01:17:41.104 --> 01:17:43.141
I ended up owing a lot of money.

1140
01:17:43.279 --> 01:17:46.696
I don't wanna see you
crash like this. never again.

1141
01:17:46.834 --> 01:17:49.181
Told you. I got
it figured out.

1142
01:17:49.319 --> 01:17:50.700
I know.

1143
01:17:50.838 --> 01:17:51.632
I know you think you have
it all under control.

1144
01:17:51.770 --> 01:17:53.772
but believe me when I tell you.

1145
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:58.535
you're either gonna have to
give this up or bring others in.

1146
01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:02.194
Jay. after this is done.
I'm getting rid of the Z Plus.

1147
01:18:02.332 --> 01:18:03.886
Whatever you say.

1148
01:18:04.990 --> 01:18:07.199
You wanna know
the worst thing?

1149
01:18:07.337 --> 01:18:09.408
Put two grand on the Jets.
You serious?

1150
01:18:09.546 --> 01:18:11.963
You came in and made that
bet yesterday. Lee. and lost.

1151
01:18:12.101 --> 01:18:13.792
No I didn't.

1152
01:18:13.930 --> 01:18:15.794
This is the
fifth time this week.

1153
01:18:15.932 --> 01:18:17.796
You keep calling and
repeating yourself.

1154
01:18:21.041 --> 01:18:23.457
Oh. shit. What day is it?

1155
01:18:23.595 --> 01:18:25.735
Really? It's Tuesday.

1156
01:18:25.873 --> 01:18:28.358
Lee. you okay?
No. I'm fine.

1157
01:18:30.326 --> 01:18:32.397
I'm fine. I just.
I gotta go. Danny.

1158
01:18:32.535 --> 01:18:37.229
Hi. Nancy. Yeah. I called my
brother. and I don't know.

1159
01:18:37.367 --> 01:18:38.783
He must be sleeping or
something like that.

1160
01:18:38.921 --> 01:18:41.026
I was just thinking
about coming by today.

1161
01:18:41.164 --> 01:18:43.408
Lee. I'm
not sure I understand.

1162
01:18:43.546 --> 01:18:44.720
No. I called Matt.

1163
01:18:44.858 --> 01:18:45.790
I just need to come by and talk

1164
01:18:45.928 --> 01:18:48.344
to him about some family stuff.

1165
01:18:48.482 --> 01:18:49.310
Lee.

1166
01:18:51.416 --> 01:18:54.695
Our conversation
yesterday. Are you okay?

1167
01:19:03.669 --> 01:19:08.295
At the end. I didn't even
know that my brother had died.

1168
01:19:11.988 --> 01:19:12.989
I'm sorry.

1169
01:19:17.994 --> 01:19:19.755
Uh uh. I'm driving.

1170
01:19:23.344 --> 01:19:25.277
Okay. according to
the information we have

1171
01:19:25.415 --> 01:19:27.383
from Simon and Martin. this
plan is based on the assumption

1172
01:19:27.521 --> 01:19:29.903
that Derrick and his guys will
try to take us down tomorrow.

1173
01:19:30.041 --> 01:19:31.249
First question is
who jumps forward

1174
01:19:31.387 --> 01:19:33.423
since we only have one pill.

1175
01:19:33.561 --> 01:19:35.253
It's Martin. Sorry. Sophia.

1176
01:19:35.391 --> 01:19:37.703
He's got the experience.
Over the next 24 hours.

1177
01:19:37.842 --> 01:19:39.602
I'll set up a security camera
system around the house

1178
01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:41.328
that will record continuously.

1179
01:19:41.466 --> 01:19:43.261
Martin. tomorrow.
you'll take the Z Plus.

1180
01:19:43.399 --> 01:19:45.194
Presumably. you'll wake
up the day of the ambush.

1181
01:19:45.332 --> 01:19:46.333
The security camera feed

1182
01:19:46.471 --> 01:19:47.852
will be sent directly
to your phone.

1183
01:19:47.990 --> 01:19:49.198
You'll have one hour to
scrub through the footage

1184
01:19:49.336 --> 01:19:52.546
to find out exactly
when and how they come.

1185
01:19:52.684 --> 01:19:53.443
I know I don't have
to tell you this.

1186
01:19:53.581 --> 01:19:55.031
but every detail helps.

1187
01:19:55.169 --> 01:19:56.515
Once you have the information.

1188
01:19:56.653 --> 01:19:58.379
you'll wake up back here
and inform us of everything.

1189
01:19:58.517 --> 01:19:59.622
At that point. Lee
and I will form a plan

1190
01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:01.417
to recontextualize
events in our favor.

1191
01:20:01.555 --> 01:20:03.695
Okay. first of all.
love the optimism.

1192
01:20:03.833 --> 01:20:06.215
but each of Derrick's men
carry enough Z serum with them

1193
01:20:06.353 --> 01:20:09.114
that they could be forwards
or backwards at any moment.

1194
01:20:09.252 --> 01:20:12.600
So no matter what we do. they
will always be ahead of us.

1195
01:20:12.738 --> 01:20:16.052
Even if this does succeed.
they're not going to stop.

1196
01:20:16.190 --> 01:20:18.503
Noted. How can I help?

1197
01:20:18.641 --> 01:20:20.677
How much control do you have
over Derrick's transactions?

1198
01:20:20.816 --> 01:20:21.920
Redirect it?
Maybe.

1199
01:20:22.058 --> 01:20:23.611
I mean. if we're
within a mile of Volkov

1200
01:20:23.749 --> 01:20:27.270
when the transaction gets
improved. then yeah. probably.

1201
01:20:27.408 --> 01:20:29.514
Love that confidence.

1202
01:20:31.033 --> 01:20:33.138
Okay. well.
you'll have it tonight.

1203
01:20:33.276 --> 01:20:35.071
Good. good. Very good.

1204
01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:39.835
Get the transfer ready.

1205
01:20:39.973 --> 01:20:42.009
The funds will be in your
account until midnight tonight.

1206
01:20:42.147 --> 01:20:43.804
Then we need answers.

1207
01:20:46.945 --> 01:20:48.878
Hey. how are we doing?

1208
01:20:50.535 --> 01:20:53.296
This definitely
isn't low risk.

1209
01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:57.197
We don't have to do this. We
can figure something else out.

1210
01:20:57.335 --> 01:21:00.407
No. We're gonna
finish the job.

1211
01:21:00.545 --> 01:21:02.754
- It'll work.
- And what if it doesn't?

1212
01:21:02.892 --> 01:21:04.963
Then you guys can run.
Jay will make some more.

1213
01:21:05.101 --> 01:21:08.070
You'll stay ahead. You'll
figure something out.

1214
01:21:08.208 --> 01:21:11.314
Thought we were
getting rid of the Z.

1215
01:21:11.452 --> 01:21:13.799
I'll leave that up to you.

1216
01:21:18.114 --> 01:21:19.391
Hey. It's okay.

1217
01:21:34.579 --> 01:21:35.683
Northwest sensor
just went off.

1218
01:21:35.821 --> 01:21:37.616
Mm-hmm. Hide everyone.

1219
01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:42.898
We gotta move. Derrick
and his guys are early.

1220
01:21:43.036 --> 01:21:44.244
They're gonna be
here in five minutes.

1221
01:21:44.382 --> 01:21:47.247
Well. shit. So question.

1222
01:21:47.385 --> 01:21:49.042
How am I supposed
to jump to tomorrow

1223
01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:50.388
and give us an heads
up if we're all going

1224
01:21:50.526 --> 01:21:53.115
to be dead within the hour?

1225
01:21:57.636 --> 01:21:59.776
It's a beautiful day.

1226
01:22:06.645 --> 01:22:09.372
You have a plan. don't you?
Are you serious?

1227
01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:12.479
Well. don't tell me.

1228
01:22:12.617 --> 01:22:15.827
I mean. I don't care.
I love surprises.

1229
01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:18.071
Do you?

1230
01:22:26.838 --> 01:22:28.460
Long time no see.

1231
01:22:29.703 --> 01:22:32.775
I wanted to thank
you for the gift.

1232
01:22:34.328 --> 01:22:35.122
Robert?

1233
01:22:36.986 --> 01:22:39.678
The name's Derrick
now. Jay Tupple.

1234
01:22:39.816 --> 01:22:42.958
What happened
to you. Robert?

1235
01:22:43.096 --> 01:22:43.924
Derrick!

1236
01:22:46.616 --> 01:22:48.239
The name is Derrick.

1237
01:22:50.655 --> 01:22:55.108
They told me about your Z Plus.
the advances that you made.

1238
01:22:55.246 --> 01:22:59.422
It's pretty amazing stuff
compared to what we used.

1239
01:23:02.839 --> 01:23:05.635
- They're jumping.
- No. he's not.

1240
01:23:07.223 --> 01:23:08.914
They only have one pill left.

1241
01:23:09.053 --> 01:23:10.709
I was gonna take
it this afternoon.

1242
01:23:13.712 --> 01:23:17.854
Sorry. Lee. I've had with
your self-serving rules.

1243
01:23:20.064 --> 01:23:24.447
Your rules got me killed.
The girl is still inside.

1244
01:23:26.104 --> 01:23:29.625
I mean. you've got a
time travel pill. right?

1245
01:23:29.763 --> 01:23:34.768
And your first thought is.
"Oh. petty crime."

1246
01:23:35.941 --> 01:23:37.460
You know what your
problem is. Lee?

1247
01:23:37.598 --> 01:23:41.326
You've got no imagination.
I mean. look at you.

1248
01:23:41.464 --> 01:23:45.813
You're a low budget Tom
Selleck cosplaying alcoholic.

1249
01:23:47.056 --> 01:23:50.646
But us. we're gonna
change the world.

1250
01:23:50.784 --> 01:23:52.165
You piece of shit.

1251
01:23:52.303 --> 01:23:53.338
You led us straight to Jay

1252
01:23:53.476 --> 01:23:54.960
and then you led
them straight here.

1253
01:23:55.099 --> 01:23:58.171
Wait for us to make a plan.
and then you fucked us.

1254
01:23:58.309 --> 01:23:59.344
Sorry.

1255
01:23:59.482 --> 01:24:02.347
Don't you take
us and let them be?

1256
01:24:02.485 --> 01:24:04.936
Oh. well. why would I do that?

1257
01:24:05.074 --> 01:24:07.835
Because you need me alive.

1258
01:24:07.973 --> 01:24:10.493
Fortunately for
me. you're fine.

1259
01:24:10.631 --> 01:24:12.047
Except I'm not.

1260
01:24:13.979 --> 01:24:16.637
I made these muscle relaxers.
and they're not good.

1261
01:24:16.775 --> 01:24:18.570
I mean. they're deadly.

1262
01:24:18.708 --> 01:24:20.020
Really. you should see

1263
01:24:20.158 --> 01:24:24.507
in the back the mass graveyard
I have in place.

1264
01:24:24.645 --> 01:24:27.717
So when I saw you
coming. I took one.

1265
01:24:29.788 --> 01:24:32.619
I have about 30 minutes to live.

1266
01:24:35.794 --> 01:24:37.072
You're lying.

1267
01:24:41.973 --> 01:24:44.976
Go ahead. kill
him. I don't care.

1268
01:24:45.114 --> 01:24:47.116
I mean. his mind is so
messed up from the Z.

1269
01:24:47.254 --> 01:24:49.187
it's probably all mush.

1270
01:24:51.016 --> 01:24:53.536
He's nothing to me. Worthless.

1271
01:24:54.779 --> 01:24:58.058
- Thank you. Jay.
- No problem.

1272
01:24:58.196 --> 01:25:01.406
But I know where an antidote is.

1273
01:25:01.544 --> 01:25:03.443
It's buried in a safe
in an empty field

1274
01:25:03.581 --> 01:25:05.238
about five miles from here.

1275
01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:11.830
We go. leave them here. get
the antidote. and off we go.

1276
01:25:21.081 --> 01:25:22.047
Oh. shit!

1277
01:25:24.671 --> 01:25:26.569
I'm not fucking around here!

1278
01:25:32.644 --> 01:25:34.059
Pack up the body.

1279
01:25:34.198 --> 01:25:35.371
I'm sure there's
some experiments they

1280
01:25:35.509 --> 01:25:37.649
could do if the old
man's not lying.

1281
01:25:40.549 --> 01:25:43.621
Number one. number
two. take them inside.

1282
01:25:43.759 --> 01:25:45.450
Number three and
I'll take this one.

1283
01:25:45.588 --> 01:25:47.763
We'll meet you back here
once we have the antidote.

1284
01:26:01.604 --> 01:26:02.812
Fuck!

1285
01:26:02.950 --> 01:26:04.469
Simon. you need to calm down.

1286
01:26:04.607 --> 01:26:06.471
Finn. Lee just got killed
and we lost a scientist.

1287
01:26:06.609 --> 01:26:08.991
What the fuck do you want?
Everything's fine.

1288
01:26:09.129 --> 01:26:12.546
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Are you sure. Finn?

1289
01:26:14.065 --> 01:26:15.239
Trust me.

1290
01:26:18.173 --> 01:26:19.415
Yes. We have the stash.

1291
01:26:19.553 --> 01:26:22.073
We have the
scientist. Lee's dead.

1292
01:26:22.211 --> 01:26:23.971
Well done. What's your ETA?

1293
01:26:24.109 --> 01:26:26.111
We have a
little bit of a situation.

1294
01:26:26.250 --> 01:26:28.113
Tupple poisoned himself.

1295
01:26:28.252 --> 01:26:29.977
We're on our way to
get the antidote.

1296
01:26:30.115 --> 01:26:32.394
Send your location.
I'll send someone.

1297
01:26:32.532 --> 01:26:35.259
Okay. no. That's
not gonna work for me.

1298
01:26:35.397 --> 01:26:37.571
And why is that. Mr. Volkov?

1299
01:26:37.709 --> 01:26:40.816
Because once you know my
location. I'm a dead man.

1300
01:26:40.954 --> 01:26:44.440
I need the transaction
approved before I return.

1301
01:26:44.578 --> 01:26:45.993
Fine.

1302
01:26:46.131 --> 01:26:46.925
I'll send half.

1303
01:26:47.063 --> 01:26:48.548
but only after I see a picture

1304
01:26:48.686 --> 01:26:50.998
of a healthy Dr.
Tupple will I approve.

1305
01:26:51.136 --> 01:26:52.724
Okay. good. Deal.

1306
01:26:55.451 --> 01:26:57.246
We have eight minutes to
get within one mile of them.

1307
01:26:57.384 --> 01:26:58.730
Need to get to the van.

1308
01:26:58.868 --> 01:27:01.008
Simon. you still think you
can redirect that transaction?

1309
01:27:01.146 --> 01:27:02.458
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1310
01:27:02.596 --> 01:27:06.221
Computer's in the van.
You have the keys. right?

1311
01:27:07.394 --> 01:27:10.397
Oh shit. I left
them on the counter.

1312
01:27:11.433 --> 01:27:13.538
Okay. We'll get the keys.

1313
01:27:13.676 --> 01:27:17.059
- How are you gonna do that?
- Improvise.

1314
01:27:27.897 --> 01:27:29.071
Take it off!

1315
01:27:32.385 --> 01:27:34.145
Tell us where the
antidote is buried.

1316
01:27:34.283 --> 01:27:38.425
It's about two feet
underneath that red reflector.

1317
01:27:38.563 --> 01:27:39.806
Go.

1318
01:27:46.916 --> 01:27:48.263
You may have some trouble.

1319
01:27:48.401 --> 01:27:51.127
It's not a combination
safe. It's an eye scanner.

1320
01:27:51.266 --> 01:27:55.408
And if he uses his eyes.
you burn 'em right out.

1321
01:27:55.546 --> 01:27:57.410
I'll call your bluff.

1322
01:29:32.332 --> 01:29:34.748
Oh. fuck! Take Jay.

1323
01:29:34.886 --> 01:29:36.440
No. no. I want you to take me.

1324
01:29:36.578 --> 01:29:38.511
- Why? No.
- Fine. I'll die.

1325
01:29:38.649 --> 01:29:41.617
I think we have five
minutes to get to them.

1326
01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:55.217
Something's wrong?

1327
01:29:55.355 --> 01:29:57.219
I don't trust you.

1328
01:29:59.083 --> 01:30:00.291
Let's go.

1329
01:30:06.918 --> 01:30:08.023
One minute.

1330
01:30:13.097 --> 01:30:14.581
You know. Robert.

1331
01:30:14.719 --> 01:30:16.756
I truly am sorry for what
I did to you and everyone.

1332
01:30:16.894 --> 01:30:19.103
I mean. my intentions
were scientific.

1333
01:30:19.241 --> 01:30:21.243
I wanted to see
what was possible.

1334
01:30:21.381 --> 01:30:23.797
what the mind was capable of.

1335
01:30:23.935 --> 01:30:25.316
If I had known this
storm was coming-

1336
01:30:25.454 --> 01:30:27.111
Shut up!

1337
01:30:30.217 --> 01:30:31.080
Do it.

1338
01:30:34.670 --> 01:30:36.051
Cheers.

1339
01:30:36.189 --> 01:30:37.604
Okay. pull over here.

1340
01:30:56.796 --> 01:30:57.590
Great.

1341
01:30:59.454 --> 01:31:01.697
Okay. good. The
transfer's been approved.

1342
01:31:01.835 --> 01:31:04.355
Soon. the system will pinpoint
the address of the receiver

1343
01:31:04.493 --> 01:31:06.150
and transfer the money
onto Volkov's device.

1344
01:31:09.429 --> 01:31:10.499
The encryption process

1345
01:31:10.637 --> 01:31:12.121
is behind a nearly
unbreakable firewall.

1346
01:31:12.259 --> 01:31:14.123
and once it's on his
device and he's air gapped.

1347
01:31:14.261 --> 01:31:16.816
the money's gone for good. but.

1348
01:31:16.954 --> 01:31:18.300
What?

1349
01:31:18.438 --> 01:31:21.510
Guess who helped design
the security system?

1350
01:31:21.648 --> 01:31:25.100
Me. I did. I designed
the security system.

1351
01:31:25.238 --> 01:31:26.377
Jesus.

1352
01:31:39.528 --> 01:31:41.323
Who is this?

1353
01:31:41.461 --> 01:31:43.843
Let's just say I'm a ghost.

1354
01:31:50.919 --> 01:31:52.437
Where are you?

1355
01:31:52.576 --> 01:31:56.027
Honestly. it's complicated.
time travel and whatnot.

1356
01:31:56.165 --> 01:31:59.721
I just wanted to
say congratulations.
Jay's all yours.

1357
01:31:59.859 --> 01:32:01.343
I never got your
name. by the way.

1358
01:32:01.481 --> 01:32:03.034
If I can clone Derrick's
device and address.

1359
01:32:03.172 --> 01:32:04.726
I can hijack the transfer.
and the money's ours.

1360
01:32:04.864 --> 01:32:06.382
Just hope no one catches on.

1361
01:32:06.521 --> 01:32:09.938
I ask again. where are you?

1362
01:32:10.076 --> 01:32:14.218
Okay. fine. But first.
I have a question.

1363
01:32:14.356 --> 01:32:16.116
What do you want with the Z?

1364
01:32:16.254 --> 01:32:18.912
I mean. all this work to
track down a crazy old man.

1365
01:32:19.050 --> 01:32:21.777
It's just me and my friends.
We love a good plan.

1366
01:32:24.228 --> 01:32:25.056
Now we just need the system

1367
01:32:25.194 --> 01:32:28.059
to find me before it finds him.

1368
01:32:28.197 --> 01:32:29.474
Lee. do you know

1369
01:32:29.613 --> 01:32:30.959
what the world's most
valuable resource is today?

1370
01:32:31.097 --> 01:32:33.478
It's not money.
It's time.

1371
01:32:33.617 --> 01:32:35.722
Now. it's data.

1372
01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:40.485
Whoever controls the
information controls everything.

1373
01:32:40.624 --> 01:32:45.180
People are products. Lee.
and with more information.

1374
01:32:45.318 --> 01:32:48.839
the more you can tell them
what to think. how to act.

1375
01:32:48.977 --> 01:32:51.911
We can bring people
together. Lee.

1376
01:32:52.049 --> 01:32:55.259
Unfortunately. Jay Tupple
seems to be the only person

1377
01:32:55.397 --> 01:32:57.779
who knows how to
make what I need.

1378
01:32:57.917 --> 01:33:01.576
Six months ago. I received
a list of subjects

1379
01:33:01.714 --> 01:33:04.958
that included both
you and Mr. Volkov.

1380
01:33:05.096 --> 01:33:08.583
Our research showed that
you were the only ones aware

1381
01:33:08.721 --> 01:33:10.792
of the location of Dr. Tupple.

1382
01:33:10.930 --> 01:33:13.760
So why not kidnap me and cut
my fingers off or something?

1383
01:33:13.898 --> 01:33:15.279
In the meantime.

1384
01:33:15.417 --> 01:33:16.970
we figured we might use you
to replenish our finances.

1385
01:33:17.108 --> 01:33:19.904
but second. Lee. as I said.

1386
01:33:20.042 --> 01:33:24.253
we at the organization don't
like to get our hands dirty.

1387
01:33:24.391 --> 01:33:25.600
Volkov.

1388
01:33:25.738 --> 01:33:27.912
He's always sending
one man jumping forward.

1389
01:33:28.050 --> 01:33:29.742
one man jumping back.

1390
01:33:30.881 --> 01:33:34.332
He never stood a chance.
Okay. okay.

1391
01:33:34.470 --> 01:33:38.509
Encryption's done. It's
bridging the two accounts.

1392
01:33:38.647 --> 01:33:42.720
It's either gonna go to
us or them. Hopefully us.

1393
01:33:42.858 --> 01:33:44.515
Now where are you?

1394
01:33:46.655 --> 01:33:48.484
Right. sorry.

1395
01:33:48.623 --> 01:33:51.280
Hmm. The better
question is when.

1396
01:33:52.281 --> 01:33:53.524
Come on. come on.

1397
01:33:55.215 --> 01:33:58.702
But sure.
physically. physically.

1398
01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:00.807
I'm in a boat with 50
million in my bank account.

1399
01:34:11.128 --> 01:34:12.094
It worked.

1400
01:34:13.613 --> 01:34:14.683
It worked!

1401
01:34:16.685 --> 01:34:21.034
Fuck yeah! Fucking told
you guys it would work!

1402
01:34:34.047 --> 01:34:36.498
Martin. get out of there
and kill Derrick and take Jay.

1403
01:34:36.636 --> 01:34:37.844
The money's all yours.

1404
01:34:40.260 --> 01:34:41.745
Right now. you're probably
calling Martin telling him

1405
01:34:41.883 --> 01:34:44.195
to get Jay and the Z
and get out of there.

1406
01:34:44.333 --> 01:34:46.025
- Hey.
- Don't bother.

1407
01:34:46.163 --> 01:34:49.545
He'll be stuck in there for
the next 30 seconds or so.

1408
01:34:49.684 --> 01:34:50.788
If you knew our plans.

1409
01:34:50.926 --> 01:34:52.445
the question is how
can you possibly know

1410
01:34:52.583 --> 01:34:54.412
what's happening next?

1411
01:34:55.931 --> 01:34:56.725
So you don't
think we have time

1412
01:34:56.863 --> 01:34:58.106
to make a fake batch?

1413
01:34:58.244 --> 01:35:00.039
Not one that's any good.

1414
01:35:01.523 --> 01:35:04.215
We'll figure it out. Come in.

1415
01:35:07.494 --> 01:35:10.187
- Did I interrupt something?
- No.

1416
01:35:11.222 --> 01:35:12.568
Do we have a plan?

1417
01:35:12.707 --> 01:35:15.882
Because I'm not thrilled about
being sidelined like this.

1418
01:35:16.020 --> 01:35:19.092
We're working on it.

1419
01:35:19.230 --> 01:35:21.888
How are you so sure
you could trust Simon

1420
01:35:22.026 --> 01:35:23.683
or Martin for that matter?

1421
01:35:23.821 --> 01:35:25.892
How do we know that
we can trust you?

1422
01:35:26.030 --> 01:35:26.721
You can't. but if
you don't need me.

1423
01:35:26.859 --> 01:35:29.068
I don't need to be here.

1424
01:35:29.206 --> 01:35:30.345
Point taken.

1425
01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:32.450
I have an idea.

1426
01:35:34.176 --> 01:35:35.281
Need you guys
to jump in the van

1427
01:35:35.419 --> 01:35:36.592
and put these sensors
down on any roadways

1428
01:35:36.731 --> 01:35:38.905
that connect to here
within five miles.

1429
01:35:39.043 --> 01:35:41.597
If they come early. we'll know.

1430
01:35:42.564 --> 01:35:43.599
Martin didn't lay
down his sensors.

1431
01:35:43.738 --> 01:35:44.911
Okay then.

1432
01:35:54.956 --> 01:35:55.750
Okay.

1433
01:35:55.888 --> 01:35:58.028
So they'll be here at 12:58 PM.

1434
01:35:58.166 --> 01:36:00.651
Derrick and three guys in masks.

1435
01:36:00.789 --> 01:36:02.273
Martin's in on it
like we thought.

1436
01:36:02.411 --> 01:36:04.275
So we're gonna need that
fake pill that you gave me.

1437
01:36:04.413 --> 01:36:07.347
I didn't totally hear why.
but Jay did something crazy.

1438
01:36:07.485 --> 01:36:11.420
and they're talking about
someone named Robert.

1439
01:36:12.387 --> 01:36:14.009
Lee. you get shot.

1440
01:36:14.147 --> 01:36:15.977
- Where?
- In the chest.

1441
01:36:16.115 --> 01:36:18.013
- It's gonna hurt.
- Four times.

1442
01:36:18.151 --> 01:36:20.188
- Did you see him die?
- No.

1443
01:36:20.326 --> 01:36:23.156
Okay. so right now Lee
is both alive and dead.

1444
01:36:23.294 --> 01:36:27.505
Schrodinger's cat. Let's
set the odds in our favor.

1445
01:36:30.301 --> 01:36:32.027
Martin. tomorrow.
you'll take the Z Plus.

1446
01:36:32.165 --> 01:36:33.960
They only have one pill left.

1447
01:36:34.098 --> 01:36:35.306
I was gonna take
it this afternoon.

1448
01:36:38.033 --> 01:36:42.313
I'm not fucking around
here! Pack up the body.

1449
01:36:42.451 --> 01:36:43.659
I'm sure there's
some experiments they

1450
01:36:43.798 --> 01:36:46.214
could do if the old
man's not lying.

1451
01:36:46.352 --> 01:36:48.319
Each of Derrick's
men carry enough Z serum

1452
01:36:48.457 --> 01:36:49.873
with them that they
could be jumping forwards

1453
01:36:50.011 --> 01:36:52.289
or backwards at any moment.

1454
01:37:06.544 --> 01:37:10.997
I told you. my friends
and I. we love a good plan.

1455
01:37:11.135 --> 01:37:12.033
See you later.

1456
01:37:14.552 --> 01:37:16.002
I said let's go!

1457
01:37:20.317 --> 01:37:22.560
We got him.

1458
01:37:22.698 --> 01:37:24.459
Oh. shit. that was hot.

1459
01:37:26.806 --> 01:37:29.050
No. no. no. no. no! Fuck!

1460
01:37:30.223 --> 01:37:31.431
You've gotta be
fucking kidding me.

1461
01:37:31.569 --> 01:37:34.331
God. he's got
bulletproof windows!

1462
01:37:34.469 --> 01:37:37.161
Hey. you piece of
shit! You're dead!

1463
01:37:37.299 --> 01:37:38.438

You know none of
this matters. right?

1467
01:37:50.347 --> 01:37:52.004
The organization
and I are weeks away

1468
01:37:52.142 --> 01:37:56.249

of Z into your fancy Z Plus!

1469
01:37:56.387 --> 01:37:57.561

So. what's
next for you. Jay?

1486
01:39:03.109 --> 01:39:06.492
Good question. I
really don't know yet.

1487
01:39:08.356 --> 01:39:11.876
Well. you know they're
gonna be after you.

1488
01:39:12.015 --> 01:39:14.810
Yeah. but don't
worry about me.

1489
01:39:14.949 --> 01:39:16.502
I'll go home. I'll
do some fishing.

1490
01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:19.229
and I'll wait for my next call.

1491
01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:25.821
You've been using.

1492
01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:28.997
- How you feeling?
- Okay. just weird.

1493
01:39:34.451 --> 01:39:37.005
The future that you
saw yesterday when
you jumped forward.

1494
01:39:37.143 --> 01:39:41.458
how close was that to what
actually happened today?

1495
01:39:41.596 --> 01:39:44.116
It was pretty close. I think.

1496
01:39:48.672 --> 01:39:50.674
Can I ask you something?

1497
01:39:51.744 --> 01:39:54.816
All these like
memories and timelines.

1498
01:39:54.954 --> 01:39:57.922
how do you decide what's real?

1499
01:39:58.061 --> 01:40:00.925
Look around.

1500
01:40:01.064 --> 01:40:03.652
figure out what you
believe is true right now.

1501
01:40:03.790 --> 01:40:05.654
and just commit to it.

1502
01:40:07.553 --> 01:40:10.659
And if you still have
questions. you can ask me.

1503
01:40:34.338 --> 01:40:36.030
Son of a bitch.

1504
01:40:36.168 --> 01:40:37.238
Hey. how's it going?

1505
01:40:37.376 --> 01:40:39.550
Whoever this is.
leave a message.

1506
01:40:39.688 --> 01:40:40.965
This is a courtesy call.

1507
01:40:41.104 --> 01:40:45.315
I hope you're running
because whenever we find you.

1508
01:40:46.764 --> 01:40:49.215
well. you and
whoever you are with

1509
01:40:49.353 --> 01:40:51.390
are going to wish you were dead.

1510
01:40:51.528 --> 01:40:52.770
Well. we don't
need money anymore.

1511
01:40:56.015 --> 01:40:57.706
So what's the plan?

1512
01:40:59.398 --> 01:41:02.228
Let's see
how far those pills get you

1513
01:41:02.366 --> 01:41:05.404
because now they're
your only chance.

1514
01:41:06.888 --> 01:41:10.512
You can say goodbye to
living in the moment. Lee.

1515
01:41:10.650 --> 01:41:14.861
because from this moment on.
if you want to stay alive.

1516
01:41:14.999 --> 01:41:16.898
you'll be living
in the yesterday.

1517
01:41:18.244 --> 01:41:20.557
the today. and the tomorrow.

1518
01:41:34.226 --> 01:41:36.055

Hello. I have some news.

1533
01:43:06.249 --> 01:43:09.113
We've had a successful test.

1534
01:43:09.252 --> 01:43:11.426
We believed we've
cracked the formula.

1535
01:43:11.564 --> 01:43:15.672
- Really?
- Yes and no.

1536
01:43:16.569 --> 01:43:18.882
What we've created is close.

1537
01:43:20.297 --> 01:43:24.405
However. whereas Z Plus
allowed trading between days.

1538
01:43:24.543 --> 01:43:27.787
this one appears to be stronger.

1539
01:43:29.064 --> 01:43:30.514
How so?

1540
01:43:30.652 --> 01:43:34.380
Sir. this isn't a
matter of hours or days.

1541
01:43:35.726 --> 01:43:40.421
We're talking about
weeks. months. maybe more.

1542
01:43:41.905 --> 01:43:43.113
