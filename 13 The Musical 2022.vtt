00:09:57.791 --> 00:10:00.416
Now you can start over.
Do whatever you want.

170
00:10:00.916 --> 00:10:02.958
You could finally write again. huh?

171
00:10:03.458 --> 00:10:06.208
Mom. Give me a little time. okay?

172
00:10:06.291 --> 00:10:09.083
Take all the time you need.
Who am I to judge?

173
00:10:09.166 --> 00:10:10.625
But. ticktock.

174
00:10:10.708 --> 00:10:12.125
I'm just saying.

175
00:10:12.916 --> 00:10:15.208
How can anyone sleep with all this quiet?

176
00:10:15.291 --> 00:10:18.375
Good morning. honey.
Put away your video game.

177
00:10:18.458 --> 00:10:19.666
[Grandma] So. Evan.

178
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:21.916
I was thinking about your Bar Mitzvah.

179
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.333
Okay. just curious.

180
00:10:23.416 --> 00:10:25.708
How many other Jews
are there in Walkerton?

181
00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:27.208
If you include us?

182
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.666
Us.

183
00:10:32.625 --> 00:10:33.750
Is there a temple?

184
00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:36.041
There is. It's called a church.

185
00:10:36.125 --> 00:10:38.791
So we'll do the party in the backyard.

186
00:10:38.875 --> 00:10:42.416
Oh. and I've got a boom box.
You can make me a mixtape.

187
00:10:43.208 --> 00:10:44.583
What's a mixtape?

188
00:10:44.666 --> 00:10:46.291
Also. I'm new here.

189
00:10:46.375 --> 00:10:49.625
If my party is awful.
I'll never live it down.

190
00:10:49.708 --> 00:10:54.166
I know it's important.
We will make it good. I promise.

191
00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:56.208
It needs to be better than good.

192
00:10:57.041 --> 00:10:59.583
Okay. Tell you what. I'll plan it.

193
00:10:59.666 --> 00:11:01.291
-You'll plan it?
-Yes.

194
00:11:01.375 --> 00:11:02.500
-You?
-Yes.

195
00:11:02.583 --> 00:11:04.208
-[Jessica] Really?
-[Evan] Yes. really.

196
00:11:04.291 --> 00:11:06.250
So it can be everything that I want.

197
00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:08.500
-Fine.
-Good.

198
00:11:08.583 --> 00:11:09.708
-Good.
-Good.

199
00:11:09.791 --> 00:11:10.750
-See?
-[door opens]

200
00:11:10.833 --> 00:11:12.000
This is family.

201
00:11:12.083 --> 00:11:13.166
[girl] Miss Ruth!

202
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.791
-Am I interrupting?
-[all] No!

203
00:11:17.375 --> 00:11:18.791
Uh. hi. Miss Ruth.

204
00:11:18.875 --> 00:11:21.625
Patrice. Perfect.

205
00:11:22.541 --> 00:11:24.125
This is my daughter. Jessica.

206
00:11:24.208 --> 00:11:28.250
And I know it's been a while.
but you and Evan remember each other. yes?

207
00:11:28.791 --> 00:11:30.083
-[Evan] No.
-[Patrice] Not really.

208
00:11:30.166 --> 00:11:32.166
Miss Ruth. I came by to return your book.

209
00:11:32.666 --> 00:11:34.625
The Bell Jar.

210
00:11:34.708 --> 00:11:38.375
Oh. this book made me wanna be a writer.

211
00:11:38.458 --> 00:11:39.791
Isn't it a little sad?

212
00:11:39.875 --> 00:11:43.083
What's sad is you're the only one
around here who knew it was sad.

213
00:11:43.583 --> 00:11:46.583
-Patrice. maybe you can show Evan around.
-[Patrice] Sure.

214
00:11:46.666 --> 00:11:47.500
Great.

215
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.500
-Wanna take some toast?
-[Evan] I'm good.

216
00:11:53.791 --> 00:11:54.625
Okay.

217
00:11:55.666 --> 00:11:57.416
-That's a cool shirt.
-Thanks.

218
00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.375
I try to warn people here that they're
destroying our wildlife with landfills.

219
00:12:01.458 --> 00:12:04.500
-And how's that going?
-Landfills are part of the tour.

220
00:12:04.583 --> 00:12:06.541
Patrice! Patrice!

221
00:12:07.166 --> 00:12:10.083
-Is that Evan?
-Yeah. Evan. this is Archie.

222
00:12:10.166 --> 00:12:12.750
-Hey. Archie.
-[Archie] I know what you're thinking.

223
00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:15.041
Yep. I'm faking it.

224
00:12:15.125 --> 00:12:17.250
I'm gonna show Evan around.

225
00:12:17.333 --> 00:12:20.625
This is around.
Let me know if you run into Kendra.

226
00:12:21.208 --> 00:12:25.375
-Wait. who's Kendra?
-An angel walking amongst us mere mortals.

227
00:12:25.458 --> 00:12:26.750
[chuckles]

228
00:12:26.833 --> 00:12:28.875
-Cool. I can't wait to meet her.
-[Patrice laughs]

229
00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958
I'm not planning on running into Kendra.
We'll see you later.

230
00:12:32.458 --> 00:12:33.333
[Archie] Fine.

231
00:12:33.416 --> 00:12:34.666
I'll be here.

232
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:35.833
[dramatically] Alone.

233
00:12:35.916 --> 00:12:37.791
The one child left behind.

234
00:12:37.875 --> 00:12:40.750
-Don't fall for it.
-See you later. Archie!

235
00:12:40.833 --> 00:12:42.333
[Archie] Welcome to Walkerton.

236
00:12:42.416 --> 00:12:44.916
If someone offers to pray for you.
let them.

237
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.208
[laughs]

238
00:12:47.208 --> 00:12:50.083
-So what is there to do around here?
-Not much.

239
00:12:50.166 --> 00:12:52.000
Yesterday I finished YouTube.

240
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.291
It's not nearly as exciting
as your life in New York.

241
00:12:55.791 --> 00:12:57.375
Exciting. right.

242
00:12:57.458 --> 00:13:00.625
My dad gets a midlife crisis.
and I get mid-America.

243
00:13:00.708 --> 00:13:03.916
Now I have to have my Bar Mitzvah
in Walkerton. Indiana.

244
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.958
For us Jews. it's the one day
that's supposed to be happy and perfect.

245
00:13:08.041 --> 00:13:09.750
See. Catholics don't have that day.

246
00:13:09.833 --> 00:13:11.791
It would go against
everything we believe in.

247
00:13:13.041 --> 00:13:15.458
[Evan] Back home. your party defines you.

248
00:13:15.541 --> 00:13:18.875
Hey. you help with my petition
to phase out single-use plastic.

249
00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.541
and I'll help you plan your party.

250
00:13:21.416 --> 00:13:23.791
Deal. And I'll make that
my Mitzvah project.

251
00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:25.375
Your what?

252
00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.250
When you have a Bar Mitzvah.

253
00:13:27.333 --> 00:13:29.791
you get to pick a charity project
that helps others.

254
00:13:30.416 --> 00:13:31.750
This is all working out.

255
00:13:31.833 --> 00:13:35.250
We'll find the best DJ
at the best ballroom at the best hotel.

256
00:13:35.333 --> 00:13:38.083
-Which is the Best Western.
-What?

-Come on. Ev. let's get inside.
-One second.

305
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:15.250
I said. "Yo. dude.
what happened to your toe?"

306
00:17:15.333 --> 00:17:17.875

I did think about him all summer and…

312
00:17:30.458 --> 00:17:32.458
we would look good together and

Lucy. it was the worst summer ever.
She put me in summer school.

and Latin and violin and science

321
00:17:49.375 --> 00:17:52.625

and watches over everything I do.

324
00:17:56.708 --> 00:18:00.416
I know! Listen. Kendra. I've been dying
to tell you about how Brett…

325
00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:01.708
Hi. everybody!

326

[all] Aw!

334
00:18:22.833 --> 00:18:24.125
This might have been

335
00:18:24.791 --> 00:18:26.041
the longest summer ever.

336
00:18:26.125 --> 00:18:27.125
[all] Aw!

337
00:18:27.208 --> 00:18:29.708

Not really. I mean. a little maybe. but…

695
00:36:29.541 --> 00:36:33.666
And it seems important that we all come
to this party of yours because.

696
00:36:34.625 --> 00:36:37.375
well. if there's a party
and I tell people not to come…

Here's the problem.
You need people at your party.

700
00:36:50.291 --> 00:36:53.916
I need to make sure Brett and Kendra
don't kiss at this movie on Friday.

701
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.208

705
00:37:01.583 --> 00:37:02.416
Of course.

706
00:37:03.166 --> 00:37:06.416
Kendra's my best friend.
and I could never hurt her. so…

707
00:37:07.541 --> 00:37:10.583
You help me.
I help you. It's quid pro quo!

708
00:37:10.666 --> 00:37:14.708
How am I supposed to stop them from
getting together if they like each other?

709
00:37:14.791 --> 00:37:17.791
You're the guy with all the answers.
You'll figure it out.

Aw. I'm so glad we're friends. Aren't you?

711

[Kendra] All right. everyone.
let's try this again. Ready. Lucy?

715

Five. six. seven…

716
00:37:36.125 --> 00:37:38.500
-Hey. Archie. How you doing?
-Pretty good.

717
00:37:39.625 --> 00:37:42.000
I guess Patrice
is still pretty mad at me. huh?

718
00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:46.583
Well. you chose those guys over her.
My guess is she hates you.

719
00:37:47.208 --> 00:37:48.666
[Kendra] Oh. let me grab my bag.

720
00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:53.375

Way to play it cool. Arch.

725
00:38:02.833 --> 00:38:05.166
If I could have ten minutes
sitting next to her.

726
00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:07.500
I would know
that I had not lived my life in vain.

727
00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:10.750
-Does she know you like her?
-Oh.

728
00:38:11.333 --> 00:38:14.083
I think she misinterpreted
my flirting for food poisoning.

729
00:38:14.708 --> 00:38:17.250
Of course. in her defense.
I did throw up after.

730
00:38:18.916 --> 00:38:23.666
What if I told you I had a way for you
to sit next to Kendra for two hours?

731
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:25.666
Next to her in the same building?

732
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:28.625
Next to her in the next seat
at the movies on Friday.

733
00:38:28.708 --> 00:38:30.833
Don't toy with me.

734
00:38:32.041 --> 00:38:35.166
Here's the thing.
Lucy is holding my party hostage

735
00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:37.416
unless I stop
Brett and Kendra from kissing.

736
00:38:37.916 --> 00:38:39.333
Okay. I'm listening.

737
00:38:39.416 --> 00:38:42.000
All right. it's pretty complicated.
but hear me out.

738
00:38:42.083 --> 00:38:43.958
What if you sit
on the other side of Kendra--

739
00:38:44.041 --> 00:38:45.583
-I'm in!
-There's more.

740
00:38:45.666 --> 00:38:46.875
Okay. keep going.

741
00:38:47.375 --> 00:38:50.166
Then. at the perfect moment.
you faint on Kendra's shoulder.

742
00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:52.666
drawing her attention
and blocking Brett from kissing her.

743
00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:54.833
Oh! And I get to kiss Kendra instead.

744
00:38:54.916 --> 00:38:57.291
What? No. The plan is.

745
00:38:57.375 --> 00:39:00.875
you make a scene and block the kiss.
and no one will get mad at you because--

746
00:39:00.958 --> 00:39:02.208
Because I'm charming.

747
00:39:02.833 --> 00:39:04.708
Yeah. that.

748
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:08.750
Lucy gets what she wants.
and everyone comes to my party.

749
00:39:08.833 --> 00:39:11.208
And I get to kiss Kendra.

750
00:39:11.833 --> 00:39:14.291
You keep saying that
as though it's part of the plan.

751
00:39:14.791 --> 00:39:16.166
It's not.

752
00:39:24.083 --> 00:39:25.791
You saved all my old journals?

753
00:39:25.875 --> 00:39:28.250
I thought I told you
to throw out all my old stuff?

754
00:39:28.916 --> 00:39:30.291
When did you say that?

755
00:39:30.375 --> 00:39:33.333
When I left home and said.
"Throw out all my old stuff."

756
00:39:33.416 --> 00:39:36.416
-Oh! Jess.
-Mom.

757
00:39:36.916 --> 00:39:38.083
Jess. [sighs]

758
00:39:39.416 --> 00:39:42.208
-You know what I miss?
-Subtlety? [sighs]

759
00:39:44.083 --> 00:39:45.000
Teaching.

760
00:39:46.083 --> 00:39:47.291
It gave me purpose.

761
00:39:47.375 --> 00:39:49.166
You were really good at it.

762
00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:53.958
You went to college. worked harder
than anyone. and earned your BFA.

763
00:39:54.041 --> 00:39:57.166
You were a writer. That was your purpose.

764
00:39:57.250 --> 00:40:00.541
And if it took a divorce
to light a fire under your tuchus.

765
00:40:00.625 --> 00:40:02.166
maybe that's a good thing.

766
00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:04.333
-I'm just saying. again.
-[Jessica sighs].

767
00:40:07.208 --> 00:40:09.541

then I'm gonna hang out with Archie.

No. wait-- Oh no--
We're supposed to have dinner together.

769
00:40:12.041 --> 00:40:13.791
And you have a Hebrew lesson.

770
00:40:14.375 --> 00:40:18.375
-I'll reschedule it for tomorrow.
-No-- Evan. Whoa. whoa. whoa. Come back.

771
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:24.791
You have blown us off every night.
You won't answer your father's calls.

772
00:40:24.875 --> 00:40:27.166
You haven't talked to me
about your Bar Mitzvah.

773
00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:29.916
And now. skipping lessons?

774
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.291
-What is going on?
-Nothing.

775
00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:35.833
You wanted to move here
and for me to make new friends.

776
00:40:35.916 --> 00:40:38.291
so here I am. making new friends.

777
00:40:38.375 --> 00:40:40.791
-At least I'm trying.
-Look. this is about you.

778
00:40:40.875 --> 00:40:44.791
You will do your lesson with the rabbi.
and then you will see your friends.

-I can't talk right now.
-[Patrice] Do you wanna come for dinner?

788
00:41:14.083 --> 00:41:17.458
I've got a whole list of movies
where Americans do bad English accents.

789

All right. fine. you broke me.
We're all going to The Bloodmaster.

790
00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:25.708
Evan made a plan
where I block Brett from kissing Kendra

791
00:41:25.791 --> 00:41:27.791
so Lucy will bring everyone to his party.

792
00:41:27.875 --> 00:41:31.625
Wait. Evan is using you
just to save his party?

793

but think about--

And this could just be fun--

and the kaf confused.

I'm sorry. there's something important
I need to do.

00:42:03.041 --> 00:42:05.250
More important than your Bar Mitzvah?

a few more steps than you.

is how you do everything.

I can't believe you told.

936

You were using Archie
just so people would come to your party.

937
00:48:52.333 --> 00:48:56.541
Or maybe you purposely wanted tonight
to fail so no one would come to my party.

938

You took advantage of my friend.
It's not me that ruined everything.

would have gone through with it?

for someone who isn't ready for you.
