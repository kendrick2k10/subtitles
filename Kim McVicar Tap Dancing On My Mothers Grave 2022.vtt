for a living. I don't.

I'm just-- I'm debating on--

656
00:31:43.249 --> 00:31:46.034
Do you guys want to get into
like. dark comedy?

-AUDIENCE: Yes!
-Are you sure? Do you like--

658
00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.909
It's so Los Angeles
of me to be like.
"Do you guys want rape jokes?"

659
00:31:50.952 --> 00:31:52.693
I should be like.
"Just take these rape jokes!

660
00:31:52.736 --> 00:31:54.608
It's a rape joke.
Don't ask permission!"

661
00:31:57.437 --> 00:31:59.874
I don't have rape jokes. guys.

662
00:31:59.918 --> 00:32:02.746
This was just a test
to see if you actually
wanted dark comedy.

663
00:32:04.096 --> 00:32:06.489
Half of you passed.

664
00:32:06.533 --> 00:32:09.666
The other half
just jumped on board.

Or not. we'll see.

666
00:32:13.235 --> 00:32:17.587
Like I said. my brother
passed away of A-I-D-S.

667
00:32:17.631 --> 00:32:20.939
I find it's easier
for people to digest it
if I spell it for you.

668
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:24.420
It's actually more fun
if we chant it.

-AUDIENCE: "A"!

AUDIENCE: AIDS!

675
00:32:34.387 --> 00:32:35.954
-What was incurable?
-AUDIENCE: AIDS.

676
00:32:35.997 --> 00:32:37.781
-What did he have?
-AUDIENCE: AIDS.

677
00:32:37.825 --> 00:32:41.220
Where did he go?
Nobody knows because
I don't believe in an afterlife.

678
00:32:41.263 --> 00:32:44.397
Patrick would've fucking
loved you for doing that.
by the way.

679
00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:46.921
He would've loved you.

680
00:32:46.965 --> 00:32:50.707
And if you didn't.
you're never gonna get
the opportunity to again.

681
00:32:51.273 --> 00:32:52.796
You missed it.

682
00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:55.016
You're not gonna go out on
the street and someone's like.

683
00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:56.104
"Give me an 'A'".

684
00:33:00.413 --> 00:33:02.937
It's such a word that people
are so afraid to talk about.

685
00:33:02.981 --> 00:33:05.809
That's why I like chanting it.
'cause everyone's so afraid

686
00:33:05.853 --> 00:33:08.899
of all of the STD words. right?
And AIDS is like the...

687
00:33:08.943 --> 00:33:10.771
And I think it's stupid. okay.

688
00:33:10.814 --> 00:33:14.644
Because there's like
actually really beautiful
moments that happened.

689
00:33:14.688 --> 00:33:16.603
Like for one.
we knew it was coming.

690
00:33:16.646 --> 00:33:19.649
So we got to say goodbye.
We got to have closure.

691
00:33:19.693 --> 00:33:21.695
Not everybody gets that
with their loved ones.

692
00:33:22.957 --> 00:33:24.915
We also got to sit down
and talk to him

693
00:33:24.959 --> 00:33:30.312
and he told me he was going
to stick it to all the people
that he hated.

694
00:33:30.356 --> 00:33:33.402
Which is nice to know
you can leave that way. right?

695
00:33:33.446 --> 00:33:36.710
I never thought about
just being an asshole
to that bitch I hate.

696
00:33:36.753 --> 00:33:38.364
Like. what?

697
00:33:38.407 --> 00:33:40.583
Hopefully. he wore a condom.
but that's on him.

698
00:33:43.934 --> 00:33:45.501
And I sat down with him

699
00:33:46.328 --> 00:33:48.287
to talk about his afterlife.

700
00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:50.941
And at first. I was afraid.

701
00:33:51.551 --> 00:33:52.987
I was petrified.

702
00:33:53.031 --> 00:33:55.120
Kept thinking--
I'm not singing. you guys.

703
00:33:55.163 --> 00:33:58.166
That song...
Not singing it.

704
00:33:58.210 --> 00:34:00.125
No. my brother.
he didn't want a funeral.

705
00:34:00.168 --> 00:34:01.996
He wanted
a celebration of life.

706
00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.519
So gay!

707
00:34:03.563 --> 00:34:07.871
Hm. Yes! So gay.
Celebration of life! Yes!

708
00:34:07.915 --> 00:34:10.700
And we gave him
everything that he wanted.
Everything that he wanted.

709
00:34:10.744 --> 00:34:12.659
I mean. he's my brother.
I love him to death.

710
00:34:13.964 --> 00:34:16.663
Okay. I didn't love
my brother to death.

711
00:34:16.706 --> 00:34:18.186
AIDS loved my brother to death.

712
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:19.622
I just loved my brother.

713
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:24.105
He wanted to have
his celebration of life

714
00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:26.412
at his favorite gay karaoke bar
in Toronto.

715
00:34:26.455 --> 00:34:28.457
And if you've never
been to a place like this.

716
00:34:28.501 --> 00:34:29.893
there's like a bunch of men

717
00:34:29.937 --> 00:34:33.375
on go-go stands up here.

the merchandize.

719
00:34:36.987 --> 00:34:38.250
It's one of those places.

720
00:34:39.251 --> 00:34:40.861
And we rented out
the back room.

721
00:34:40.904 --> 00:34:42.993
no pun intended.
that's just really what we did.

722
00:34:47.128 --> 00:34:48.434
And I go in with my mom.

723
00:34:48.477 --> 00:34:50.827
who is obviously upset.
her son just passed away.

724
00:34:50.871 --> 00:34:52.090
We get into the back.

725
00:34:52.133 --> 00:34:55.005
and there are giant
dick statues everywhere.

726
00:34:55.049 --> 00:34:57.921
Like. I'm talking down
to the floor all the way
up to the ceiling--

727
00:34:57.965 --> 00:35:01.621
Huge dick statues.
and I just lose it.

728
00:35:01.664 --> 00:35:04.363
I start laughing.
I'm like. "Ha-ha-ha.

729
00:35:04.406 --> 00:35:08.106
Oh! I see what you did here.
man! I see what you did."

730
00:35:08.149 --> 00:35:12.675
He had his funeral at a place
people had to go to.

731
00:35:12.719 --> 00:35:16.418
My mom's suburban friends
had to go to support my mom.

732
00:35:16.462 --> 00:35:20.248
These are people who have
never been to a gay bar before.

733
00:35:20.292 --> 00:35:23.425
I was just taking pictures
with Connie with a giant
dick behind her.

Yes!

736
00:35:33.043 --> 00:35:36.569
Like. the only way I could
beat my brother at a funeral

737
00:35:36.612 --> 00:35:38.223
is if I had mine at an orgy.

738
00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:42.575
Right? My uncle will be like.
"Yeah. let's go!"

739
00:35:42.618 --> 00:35:45.708
And my aunt will be like.
"I don't know.
I guess I'll bring flowers."

740
00:35:47.319 --> 00:35:51.192
Why do we do that?
Why do we bring
flowers to funerals?

741
00:35:51.236 --> 00:35:53.499
Here's something that's gonna
pass away in two weeks

742
00:35:53.542 --> 00:35:56.284
to remind you of what
you've just been through.

Stop doing it! Stop!
Just Venmo them. it's fine.

744
00:36:02.595 --> 00:36:05.293
And like I said. we knew
that he was going to die.

745
00:36:05.337 --> 00:36:07.730
So he gave me
all his passwords to stuff.

746
00:36:07.774 --> 00:36:09.515
So I created a Facebook e-vite.

747

a "Celebration of Life".

'cause there's probably people
I don't know in his life.

to me and he goes.

Before I could say
anything to him.

757
00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.586
he was like.
"I was talking to him online.

758
00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:39.719
and he stopped talking back
to me two weeks ago.

00:36:39.762 --> 00:36:41.329

Patrick was too.
