00:00:54.096 --> 00:00:56.473
Attention. attention.

4
00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:58.559
Three minutes
to full concert rehearsal.

5
00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:02.229
Three minutes
to full concert rehearsal.

6
00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:17.911
Hey.

7
00:01:29.548 --> 00:01:32.801
-Mademoiselle.
-So nice we can do this.

8
00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:35.637
Grazie.

9
00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.700
Go!

10
00:01:57.826 --> 00:01:59.203
Careful.

11
00:02:14.635 --> 00:02:16.136
Quickly!

12
00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:26.271
Thank you.

13
00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:04.393
Move. move. move!

14
00:03:04.393 --> 00:03:06.019
Charlie. what's your status?

15
00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.272
-In position.
-Copy.

16
00:03:08.272 --> 00:03:11.358
-Thermal count's 15.
-Right. warriors. are we ready?

17
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.280
Remember. this is our game.
This is what we're made for.

18
00:03:17.072 --> 00:03:19.491
Keep it calm. steady and ready.

19
00:03:19.491 --> 00:03:22.327
You know the drill.
We've done it 100 times before.

20
00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:24.872
In and out. quick.
Keep it clean. no dirty boots.

21
00:03:24.872 --> 00:03:26.415
We'll be home before dinner.

22
00:03:26.415 --> 00:03:28.000
Dinner at your place.

23
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.918
Yeah. Helene's cooking.
you do the dishes.

24
00:03:31.253 --> 00:03:33.881
Alright. let's rock and roll.

25
00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:35.591
-Turn off the lights.
-Copy.

26
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:37.217
Go to silent.

27
00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:42.931
You are probably all wondering.

28
00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:45.309
why have these monsters...

29
00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:48.187
...taken
the National Opera hostage.

30
00:03:48.187 --> 00:03:49.605
the night...

31
00:03:49.605 --> 00:03:52.816
...before
their grand opening performance?

32
00:03:52.816 --> 00:03:55.986
Team leader in position.
Enemy in sight.

33
00:03:55.986 --> 00:03:58.197
Copy that.
Charlie heading in position.

34
00:03:58.197 --> 00:04:00.991
I assure you. we do not.

35
00:04:00.991 --> 00:04:02.284
John?

36
00:04:02.284 --> 00:04:05.621
I see it.
All teams. wait for my order.

37
00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:07.247
Copy. Waiting for the orders.

38
00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:10.459
Our agenda is strictly monetary.

39
00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:11.960
I don't know. John.

40
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.755
He's bluffing.
It's all about money.

41
00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:18.300
...conduct again.
all you have to do

42
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:23.263
is help us meet our goal
of 300 million. And to...

43
00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:26.391
...show you the kind of
production

44
00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:29.186
we hope to entertain...
...you with.

45
00:04:29.186 --> 00:04:30.395
Miss Mollini.

46
00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:32.272
-Let me ice this prick.
-No.

47
00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:34.900
Wait till we're all in position.
We can floor him.

48
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.069
Come. come. come. come.

49
00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:41.156
Our...
...beautiful nightingale.
please...

50
00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:43.283
...sing for us.

51
00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:47.162
Easy. soldier. he's bluffing.

52
00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:50.040
Sing. Sing for us.

53
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.043
Sing for us one...

54
00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:55.170
...last time.

55
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.297
No!

56
00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:59.758
Stand down. you hear me?
Stand down.

57
00:04:59.758 --> 00:05:01.051
You have one hour.

58
00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:03.053
Screw that!

59
00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:11.687
No. Matteo! Goddammit!

60
00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:15.107
All positions. we're moving in!

61
00:05:15.107 --> 00:05:16.316
Move. move. move!

62
00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:19.027
Copy that. moving in.

63
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.578
-Bravo. moving in.
-Go. go. go!

64
00:05:27.578 --> 00:05:28.954
-Moving in.
-Copy.

65
00:05:28.954 --> 00:05:30.622
Matteo. on your left!

66
00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:31.957
Fuck. ah!

67
00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:34.626
Ah. son of a bitch!

68
00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:36.879
Behind you! Shit.

69
00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:38.630
Charlie entering backstage area.

70
00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.591
On your right.

71
00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:45.846
I think I got him.

72
00:05:47.598 --> 00:05:49.725
-Clear.
-Come on!

73
00:05:49.725 --> 00:05:51.393
Matteo. come on!

74
00:05:55.314 --> 00:05:57.232
-Entrance clear.
-Come on!

75
00:06:08.243 --> 00:06:10.329
Come to the stage now. quick!

76
00:06:10.329 --> 00:06:12.289
-To the stage!
-Copy. Coming your way.

77
00:06:15.042 --> 00:06:17.169
Come here. asshole!

78
00:06:18.086 --> 00:06:21.423
Two enemies down.
Securing main stage.

79
00:06:21.423 --> 00:06:23.050
Team Bravo. clear.

80
00:06:23.926 --> 00:06:25.928
Team Charlie. clear.

81
00:06:25.928 --> 00:06:27.471
Team Alpha. clear.

82
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.682
What the hell is wrong
with you. soldier?

83
00:06:30.682 --> 00:06:33.268
I gave you a direct order. Huh?

84
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.190
You're gonna get us all killed.
You jeopardized the mission.

85
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.442
I gave you an order. soldier.

86
00:06:40.442 --> 00:06:42.069
-Shit.
-Damn.

87
00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:44.321
-What's wrong?
-I'm hit. I'm hit.

88
00:06:44.321 --> 00:06:47.783
-You're hit? Medic!
-No. it's okay.

89
00:06:47.783 --> 00:06:50.202
It's not that bad. Not that bad.

90
00:06:50.202 --> 00:06:52.621
Team leader down! Medic!

91
00:06:52.621 --> 00:06:55.082
Medic's on the way.

92
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.961
I think you'd better
call Helene.

93
00:06:58.961 --> 00:07:01.797
Tell her we'll be a little late
for dinner.

94
00:07:01.797 --> 00:07:03.465
No. we'll make it.

95
00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:06.343
-Fuck.
-You'll be fine.

96
00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:10.013
-We got them all. right?
-Yeah. we got them all.

97
00:07:10.013 --> 00:07:12.140
We saved everybody.

98
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.893
No. you haven't saved anyone.

99
00:07:14.893 --> 00:07:17.229
I'm just gonna blow up
this place.

100
00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:19.064
Do it.

101
00:07:32.578 --> 00:07:36.665
John! John!

102
00:07:41.128 --> 00:07:45.340
Team up on the stage.
We lost the team leader.

103
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.718
Repeat: Lost team leader.

104
00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:23.921
Watch it.

105
00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:33.615
Whoo! Hey. Hey. beauty.

106
00:09:39.413 --> 00:09:41.707
Such a good girl.

107
00:09:41.707 --> 00:09:43.083
Angie.

108
00:09:45.294 --> 00:09:48.005
Whoa whoa whoa.

109
00:09:48.005 --> 00:09:49.423
It's a fish.

110
00:09:53.218 --> 00:09:54.636
Go!

111
00:09:54.636 --> 00:09:57.681
Angie. smile.

112
00:10:09.276 --> 00:10:11.778
-You quitting?
-I gotta keep moving.

113
00:10:14.656 --> 00:10:17.951
Well. you're leaving me short.

114
00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:21.288
So. this is what you get.

115
00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:43.602
-Bucharest?
-Yes. of course.

116
00:11:38.574 --> 00:11:40.158
Well. well. well.

117
00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:43.078
What do we have here?

118
00:11:43.078 --> 00:11:47.958
The Sindikheth and Consociation
all gathered here together.

119
00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.960
Must be
a super special occasion.

120
00:11:51.086 --> 00:11:52.546
Like one of those weddings

121
00:11:52.546 --> 00:11:55.090
where all the relatives
you forgot you had

122
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.426
show up to the free buffet.

123
00:11:57.426 --> 00:11:58.677
Is that what this is?

124
00:11:58.677 --> 00:12:01.597
A joining of two spirits?
How sweet.

125
00:12:01.597 --> 00:12:06.226
Look at this.
My favorite breakfast.

126
00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:08.228
This one comes with a present.

127
00:12:09.438 --> 00:12:11.106
Keeps you going all day.

128
00:12:14.151 --> 00:12:16.904
So. who's the lucky bride?

129
00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:20.908
What did you say?

130
00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:27.372
That's no way to talk to a lady.

131
00:12:31.627 --> 00:12:33.587
You fucking son of a bitch.

132
00:12:35.005 --> 00:12:37.591
Get the fuck up!
Spitting on my shoe. huh?

133
00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:41.345
Move!

134
00:12:43.138 --> 00:12:45.182
Sorry I didn't
bring flowers. eh.

135
00:12:51.146 --> 00:12:52.856
Come on. stand up.

136
00:13:02.407 --> 00:13:05.118
-Tell me.
-Interpol was waiting for us.

137
00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:07.871
-And the shipment?
-Gone.

138
00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:38.318
Watch it. man. Watch it.

139
00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:43.866
Do you have any idea

140
00:13:43.866 --> 00:13:46.702
how hard it is to get blood
out of Italian calfskin?

141
00:13:46.702 --> 00:13:49.705
No. Why don't you
try some water. huh?

142
00:13:49.705 --> 00:13:50.914
Oh. you're an expert now?

143
00:13:53.917 --> 00:13:55.294
Don't be a girl.

144
00:13:56.295 --> 00:13:58.922
Okay. Roman. That's
a shipment off the streets.

145
00:13:58.922 --> 00:14:01.091
But it doesn't put us any closer
to the big players.

146
00:14:01.091 --> 00:14:04.052
Actually. it does.
So take the win. Shira.

147
00:14:05.053 --> 00:14:07.890
Hitting the Consociation and
the Sindikheth at the same time

148
00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:09.308
puts a pressure on them

149
00:14:09.308 --> 00:14:11.476
while they're trying
to link up together.

150
00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:14.104
Boss. we could get a medal
for this shit.

151
00:14:16.398 --> 00:14:17.900
Fine.

152
00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.902
But I want
the whole Consociation.

153
00:14:19.902 --> 00:14:21.653
not its droppings.

154
00:14:21.653 --> 00:14:23.405
I know it's personal.

155
00:14:23.405 --> 00:14:26.450
But I promise you.
this was just a warm-up.

156
00:14:27.034 --> 00:14:30.746
Now we crank the heat and
we force them to make a mistake.

157
00:14:38.754 --> 00:14:41.548
The train to Dordrecht.

158
00:14:41.548 --> 00:14:44.259
Lage Zwaluwe and Roosendaal.

159
00:14:44.259 --> 00:14:48.555
scheduled at 8:31 p.m..
departs from platform...

160
00:14:58.524 --> 00:15:00.651
Yeah. Nick.
let me cut to the chase.

161
00:15:00.651 --> 00:15:04.905
So. it's an ERC20 blockchain
called Taltos.

162
00:15:04.905 --> 00:15:08.242
Every database will be using it
within two years.

163
00:15:08.242 --> 00:15:10.786
and now for a small
no-risk investment

164
00:15:10.786 --> 00:15:12.538
you can get in on it now.

165
00:15:13.664 --> 00:15:15.582
Uh. just 15 million euros.

166
00:15:16.333 --> 00:15:17.918
I know

167
00:15:17.918 --> 00:15:20.838
I know they've been telling that
crypto's been dead for years.

168
00:15:20.838 --> 00:15:23.423
but. hey. the only place
it's going is up.

169
00:15:24.716 --> 00:15:26.552
Oh. come on. Nick.

170
00:15:26.552 --> 00:15:30.305
Help me make the ICO.
You'll be glad you did it.

171
00:15:33.225 --> 00:15:36.854
Okay. I guess we'll have to see
how you feel about that

172
00:15:36.854 --> 00:15:39.648
when you see me cruising by
in a new Bentley.

173
00:15:39.648 --> 00:15:42.734
Right. Okay.

174
00:15:42.734 --> 00:15:45.529
Okay. thanks.
Thanks. talk to you later.

175
00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:42.252
-I'm looking for...
-You're so tall.

176
00:16:42.252 --> 00:16:45.297
Can you get a cat
out of the tree?

177
00:16:45.297 --> 00:16:47.090
Can you dunk a basketball?

178
00:16:49.301 --> 00:16:50.761
Is Helene Meyers home?

179
00:16:52.054 --> 00:16:53.472
Meyers...

180
00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:56.016
Mommy!

181
00:16:57.059 --> 00:17:01.647
Mommy.
there is somebody at the door!

182
00:17:02.231 --> 00:17:04.399
Who is it. sweetheart?

183
00:17:04.399 --> 00:17:07.069
I don't know. but he's big.

184
00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:16.036
Hey.

185
00:17:20.791 --> 00:17:22.584
Where have you been?

186
00:17:27.214 --> 00:17:29.591
Angie. do you remember Matteo?

187
00:17:29.591 --> 00:17:32.177
-He's a friend of your dad's.
-Paul?

188
00:17:32.177 --> 00:17:35.722
-No. honey. your dad.
-You knew my real dad?

189
00:17:39.309 --> 00:17:40.936
He was my best friend.

190
00:17:42.312 --> 00:17:44.523
Did he like broccoli?

191
00:17:48.193 --> 00:17:50.529
-No.
-I knew it.

192
00:17:52.447 --> 00:17:53.407
Well...

193
00:17:54.741 --> 00:17:56.952
Don't stand there like a lug.
Come inside.

194
00:17:56.952 --> 00:17:58.328
I'll make some coffee.

195
00:18:26.064 --> 00:18:29.109
His name is Paul.
We got married last year.

196
00:18:29.985 --> 00:18:31.612
He's been good to us.

197
00:18:38.327 --> 00:18:40.495
We missed you at John's funeral.

198
00:18:41.872 --> 00:18:43.207
Yeah.

199
00:18:44.625 --> 00:18:45.876
I wanted to come.

200
00:18:47.252 --> 00:18:49.129
-But...
-I know.

201
00:18:49.129 --> 00:18:51.256
We all lost a lot that day.

202
00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:54.259
It's just that...

203
00:18:56.303 --> 00:18:59.932
You were like his brother.
Always there for him.

204
00:18:59.932 --> 00:19:02.184
It would have been nice if you
could have been there for us

205
00:19:02.184 --> 00:19:04.645
when we needed you.

206
00:19:04.645 --> 00:19:07.898
Anyway.
it's good you're here now.

207
00:19:10.526 --> 00:19:12.069
I came because...

208
00:19:14.363 --> 00:19:16.657
there's something
I needed to tell you.

209
00:19:18.992 --> 00:19:20.160
What?

210
00:19:24.081 --> 00:19:27.501
-It was my fault John died.
-No. stop.

211
00:19:27.501 --> 00:19:30.003
-I wasn't fast enough.
-I said stop.

212
00:19:30.003 --> 00:19:32.464
-It should have been me.
-Shut up!

213
00:19:36.718 --> 00:19:38.554
You don't get to come here.

214
00:19:38.554 --> 00:19:41.682
not after I moved on.
and make me relive my grief.

215
00:19:42.975 --> 00:19:44.518
Look at me.

216
00:19:46.228 --> 00:19:47.896
You don't get to do that.

217
00:19:49.982 --> 00:19:51.984
Not when you couldn't even
be bothered

218
00:19:51.984 --> 00:19:53.569
to show up for his funeral.

219
00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.197
What kind of brother does that?

220
00:20:09.001 --> 00:20:10.294
I'm sorry.

221
00:20:22.764 --> 00:20:25.893
Fuck.

222
00:20:40.574 --> 00:20:41.700
Matteo.

223
00:20:42.576 --> 00:20:44.203
Do you have anywhere to stay?

224
00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.248
I'll find something.
I'll be fine.

225
00:20:48.248 --> 00:20:51.210
We have an extra room.
so come back inside.

226
00:20:52.586 --> 00:20:54.087
Please.

227
00:21:14.316 --> 00:21:15.400
What is this?

228
00:21:16.276 --> 00:21:20.280
It's mushroom stew. sir.
One of our most popular dishes.

229
00:21:21.782 --> 00:21:24.243
This is the famous
mushroom stew?

230
00:21:27.162 --> 00:21:29.414
Why isn't anyone else having it?

231
00:21:32.751 --> 00:21:35.295
How many times are we gonna have
this conversation?

232
00:21:37.005 --> 00:21:40.175
I'm gonna give you
another month. Okay?

233
00:21:40.175 --> 00:21:42.511
One more month.

234
00:21:42.511 --> 00:21:46.765
And then maybe I bring in
a new chef. a new menu. Yeah?

235
00:21:48.183 --> 00:21:49.643
Think that's fair?

236
00:21:54.022 --> 00:21:57.693
-Anything else. sir?
-People. Ha!

237
00:21:57.693 --> 00:22:00.320
I'd like some people. People.

238
00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:02.823
Go.

239
00:22:02.823 --> 00:22:03.991
Thank you.

240
00:22:19.882 --> 00:22:21.466
That was a good day.

241
00:22:23.886 --> 00:22:26.180
-Yeah.
-It's for you.

242
00:22:27.556 --> 00:22:28.599
Thanks.

243
00:22:29.224 --> 00:22:32.519
You know. I kept all his things.

244
00:22:32.519 --> 00:22:34.855
His clothes. medals.
everything. so...

245
00:22:35.731 --> 00:22:38.233
if you need anything. take it.

246
00:22:38.233 --> 00:22:39.943
He would have liked that.

247
00:22:46.366 --> 00:22:47.576
Matteo.

248
00:22:49.203 --> 00:22:51.830
It really is good to see you.

249
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:53.707
It's just that...

250
00:22:53.707 --> 00:22:55.584
I'm sorry it took so long.

251
00:22:58.003 --> 00:23:00.839
Matteo!

252
00:23:00.839 --> 00:23:03.926
And now you're gonna have to
deal with your new best friend.

253
00:23:03.926 --> 00:23:05.594
Yeah.

254
00:23:05.594 --> 00:23:07.221
Matteo?

255
00:23:08.013 --> 00:23:10.098
See these two?

256
00:23:10.098 --> 00:23:12.059
They are running
the whole investigation.

257
00:23:20.817 --> 00:23:22.277
Taking pictures?

258
00:23:27.783 --> 00:23:29.535
I spoke to our Mr Nay.

259
00:23:30.452 --> 00:23:32.788
We both agree that whether
this rat is in my house

260
00:23:32.788 --> 00:23:34.456
or in his house.

261
00:23:34.456 --> 00:23:36.917
we don't continue business
until it's found.

262
00:23:36.917 --> 00:23:38.961
-Mmm. yeah.
-Now. if it is in my house.

263
00:23:38.961 --> 00:23:42.256
it's up to you two to find it.
Fast.

264
00:23:49.054 --> 00:23:50.639
-Hey.
-Hey.

265
00:23:50.639 --> 00:23:52.850
-How was your day?
-Well...

266
00:23:54.059 --> 00:23:55.936
Where's the hobbit?

267
00:23:55.936 --> 00:23:57.145
There.

268
00:24:02.025 --> 00:24:03.986
There you go.

269
00:24:07.447 --> 00:24:09.741
Why is she having a tea party
with a giant?

270
00:24:10.659 --> 00:24:13.161
That's Matteo. John's friend.

271
00:24:13.161 --> 00:24:17.332
He stopped by today and I don't
think he's got anywhere to go.

272
00:24:17.332 --> 00:24:20.961
so I thought maybe we could
take him in for a few days.

273
00:24:22.129 --> 00:24:23.172
Of course.

274
00:24:28.218 --> 00:24:30.596
I think we should get him
a new chair.

275
00:24:31.388 --> 00:24:33.599
He's gonna break that one.

276
00:24:41.773 --> 00:24:43.192
Santé.

277
00:24:43.192 --> 00:24:45.611
Cheers.
everybody. it's a real honor.

278
00:25:07.382 --> 00:25:11.386
Message
to return. Target two miles.

279
00:25:11.386 --> 00:25:15.224
Target number
Alpha Bravo 1-0-0-4. Over.

280
00:25:16.141 --> 00:25:17.893
Copy that.

281
00:25:17.893 --> 00:25:21.438
You remember that girl
at Cappie's retirement party?

282
00:25:21.438 --> 00:25:23.065
The one
in the blue dress. you mean?

283
00:25:23.065 --> 00:25:24.316
That's the one. Skylar.

284
00:25:24.316 --> 00:25:26.777
You pretended you were too drunk
to dance.

285
00:25:27.569 --> 00:25:29.112
I don't dance.

286
00:25:29.112 --> 00:25:31.823
Why? Are you too tall?
You think you'd look stupid?

287
00:25:31.823 --> 00:25:35.035
I've seen you dance.

288
00:25:37.079 --> 00:25:40.332
-We're in position. Ready to go.
-Copy that.

289
00:25:40.332 --> 00:25:44.419
Look. all I'm saying is
that when we get back home.

290
00:25:44.419 --> 00:25:46.922
you oughta give that girl
a call.

291
00:25:46.922 --> 00:25:48.757
Take her out for dinner.

292
00:25:48.757 --> 00:25:52.052
-That's Helene's idea. isn't it?
-No. No. no.

293
00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:55.180
Did she say something
about it too?

294
00:25:56.431 --> 00:26:00.185
Just that if I didn't call her.
I was gonna die alone.

295
00:26:00.185 --> 00:26:03.814
I fucking love that woman.

296
00:26:03.814 --> 00:26:06.525
She went straight
for the jugular. huh?

297
00:26:06.525 --> 00:26:08.735
She just wants you to be happy.

298
00:26:09.695 --> 00:26:12.865
-Tell her I am happy.
-You tell her yourself.

299
00:26:13.907 --> 00:26:16.493
But I bet she loves it when
you're out in the field. huh?

300
00:26:16.493 --> 00:26:17.911
Instead of hanging
around the house.

301
00:26:17.911 --> 00:26:20.789
At least when I'm out here.
she can't hound me

302
00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:23.876
about building those gazebos
in the back yard. man.

303
00:26:23.876 --> 00:26:27.296
Oh. there we go.
Target in sight.

304
00:26:27.296 --> 00:26:29.506
By the way...

305
00:26:29.506 --> 00:26:31.258
Helene's pregnant.

306
00:26:31.258 --> 00:26:33.260
Couldn't you wait
until after the shot?

307
00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:37.681
I thought you wanted to know.

308
00:26:39.016 --> 00:26:42.769
Any idea who the father is?

309
00:26:42.769 --> 00:26:44.354
I got a pretty good idea.

310
00:26:44.354 --> 00:26:46.148
Coast clear. Bravo. move in.

311
00:26:46.148 --> 00:26:47.774
-You fucker.
-Bravo moving in.

312
00:26:47.774 --> 00:26:49.484
We've got the assets.

313
00:26:49.484 --> 00:26:50.944
See you
at the rendezvous point.

314
00:26:51.612 --> 00:26:54.281
You give
that Skylar girl a call.

315
00:26:54.281 --> 00:26:55.782
I'll think about it.

316
00:26:55.782 --> 00:26:58.660
You think about it?
There's nothing to think about.

317
00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:02.456
You do it when we get home.

318
00:27:07.085 --> 00:27:10.088
Angie?
You coming to bed?

319
00:27:10.088 --> 00:27:11.131
Come.

320
00:27:13.091 --> 00:27:15.761
-I like him.
-You do?

321
00:27:17.179 --> 00:27:18.472
Me too.

322
00:27:18.472 --> 00:27:21.475
He's been alone for a long time.

323
00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.979
I think he needs a new friend.

324
00:27:25.979 --> 00:27:28.148
You're right. honey.

325
00:27:30.359 --> 00:27:33.028
-Goodnight. honey.
-Goodnight.

326
00:27:41.828 --> 00:27:43.288
There you go. buddy.

327
00:27:55.968 --> 00:28:00.013
Bet you've seen beautiful skies
all over the world. huh?

328
00:28:06.562 --> 00:28:08.397
You got a favorite spot?

329
00:28:10.357 --> 00:28:12.109
Afghanistan.

330
00:28:13.151 --> 00:28:14.319
Seriously?

331
00:28:16.113 --> 00:28:19.199
The night there
is quiet. It's...

332
00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:22.870
peaceful.

333
00:28:25.038 --> 00:28:26.748
Must be hard.

334
00:28:26.748 --> 00:28:30.210
coming home
with nothing left to fight for.

335
00:28:33.088 --> 00:28:35.507
There's always something
to fight for.

336
00:28:38.427 --> 00:28:39.595
Yeah.

337
00:28:41.638 --> 00:28:42.806
Of course.

338
00:28:46.476 --> 00:28:48.854
Good talking to you. Goodnight.

339
00:29:01.617 --> 00:29:04.036
He's not gonna pee
on the carpet.

340
00:29:04.036 --> 00:29:06.872
No.

341
00:29:07.915 --> 00:29:11.001
-But he's just like...
-Like what?

342
00:29:11.001 --> 00:29:13.378
Uh... I don't know.

343
00:29:14.296 --> 00:29:16.465
I was just trying to find
a nice way

344
00:29:16.465 --> 00:29:18.509
to say "like he's damaged."

345
00:29:21.345 --> 00:29:22.554
You know...

346
00:29:23.472 --> 00:29:26.433
John never could talk much
about it. but...

347
00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:30.812
the things they did.
they saw over there.

348
00:29:30.812 --> 00:29:33.106
they deal with it different
than us.

349
00:29:33.106 --> 00:29:37.319
Okay? So. try and cut him
a little slack.

350
00:29:37.319 --> 00:29:40.322
Yeah. I know. I know.
I'm just a little. uh...

351
00:29:40.322 --> 00:29:42.157
What? Intimidated?

352
00:29:42.157 --> 00:29:46.119
Hey. cut me some slack.
will you?

353
00:29:47.579 --> 00:29:50.332
He's a ghost from your past.
so maybe I am a little bit.

354
00:29:50.332 --> 00:29:54.086
Well. you shouldn't be.
'Cause I'm not looking back.

355
00:29:54.086 --> 00:29:57.005
I'm moving forward.
It's all I want to do now.

356
00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:00.801
I hope it's not all
you want to do.

357
00:31:32.518 --> 00:31:35.437
I'm late.
I can't do this every day.

358
00:31:37.481 --> 00:31:40.359
Will you take care
of Daisy for me?

359
00:31:42.402 --> 00:31:43.779
Yeah.

360
00:31:43.779 --> 00:31:45.989
Will you be here
when I get back?

361
00:31:46.615 --> 00:31:47.741
I don't know.

362
00:31:47.741 --> 00:31:50.285
Then we can have
another tea party.

363
00:31:50.285 --> 00:31:53.330
How can you say no to that?

364
00:31:55.415 --> 00:31:56.375
Thank you.

365
00:31:59.044 --> 00:32:00.879
Bye. Daisy!

366
00:32:09.012 --> 00:32:12.432
Yes. James.
you can count on that of course.

367
00:32:13.225 --> 00:32:14.518
Uh...

368
00:32:15.936 --> 00:32:18.188
Let me call you right back.
Okay.

369
00:32:20.357 --> 00:32:22.234
-Gabriel.
-Paul.

370
00:32:22.234 --> 00:32:23.652
Hey.

371
00:32:23.652 --> 00:32:26.947
-Well. please.
-Sit down.

372
00:32:27.823 --> 00:32:33.120
Uh. can I get you something?
Coffee. tea. Dr Pepper?

373
00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:36.456
No. caffeine upsets
my acid reflux.

374
00:32:37.541 --> 00:32:40.335
Well. you coming here
isn't exactly good

375
00:32:40.335 --> 00:32:42.713
for my acid reflux either.

376
00:32:42.713 --> 00:32:45.215
-What's going on?
-I don't know. Paul.

377
00:32:45.215 --> 00:32:48.010
I was hoping you could tell me
what's going on.

378
00:32:49.469 --> 00:32:53.348
-What is this? A riddle?
-Yes. it's a riddle.

379
00:32:53.348 --> 00:32:57.102
And the riddle is: What the fuck
happened to my 15 million euros

380
00:32:57.102 --> 00:33:01.023
that mysteriously disappeared
from my accounts. Paul?

381
00:33:01.982 --> 00:33:04.526
-Oh.
-Oh.

382
00:33:04.526 --> 00:33:07.821
Uh... Let me check it out.

383
00:33:09.031 --> 00:33:10.324
Uh...

384
00:33:13.911 --> 00:33:18.874
Okay. Okay. yeah. now...
Okay. I see it. Uhm...

385
00:33:18.874 --> 00:33:22.169
There were some complications
and I should have let you know.

386
00:33:24.505 --> 00:33:25.756
Complications?

387
00:33:27.424 --> 00:33:29.718
With my money.
What kind of complications?

388
00:33:29.718 --> 00:33:31.178
Well. this uh...

389
00:33:32.054 --> 00:33:35.557
This software we're using. uh.
it updated itself.

390
00:33:35.557 --> 00:33:39.728
And. uh.
now there's a damn glitch.

391
00:33:39.728 --> 00:33:43.023
Something to do with routing
numbers and time zones.

392
00:33:43.023 --> 00:33:45.275
It's all over my head. really.

393
00:33:45.275 --> 00:33:47.236
but basically
it stopped tracking

394
00:33:47.236 --> 00:33:49.738
our encrypted transfers
in real time.

395
00:33:52.658 --> 00:33:56.662
Could you get me someone
over at ZeroTech. please. Yeah?

396
00:33:56.662 --> 00:33:59.540
-I'll have it fixed ASAP.
-Oh good. okay.

397
00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:02.376
So it's just me being
paranoid here. We're fine?

398
00:34:02.376 --> 00:34:05.128
The money's all there. you just
can't see it right now. See?

399
00:34:05.128 --> 00:34:08.048
No. Paul. I don't see.
That's the problem. you know?

400
00:34:08.048 --> 00:34:12.177
But I like you. And I know
you'd never fuck me because...

401
00:34:12.177 --> 00:34:13.804
that would make you crazy.

402
00:34:16.098 --> 00:34:19.351
I'll get it fixed by tomorrow.

403
00:34:19.351 --> 00:34:22.312
-Tomorrow?
-Yeah. that's right.

404
00:34:22.312 --> 00:34:23.730
No more complications.

405
00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:26.984
No more. and if there are. uh...

406
00:34:26.984 --> 00:34:29.319
then I'll have bigger issues
to worry about.

407
00:34:29.319 --> 00:34:32.865
No. No. Paul. you
wouldn't have bigger issues. No.

408
00:34:32.865 --> 00:34:35.617
You wouldn't have any issues.

409
00:34:40.122 --> 00:34:41.748
This your family?

410
00:34:41.748 --> 00:34:44.585
God. that is a handsome woman.
Handsome.

411
00:34:45.627 --> 00:34:48.922
You know. we should have dinner
one time. We've never done that.

412
00:34:49.631 --> 00:34:51.633
-No.
-I got a good place.

413
00:34:51.633 --> 00:34:53.468
You like mushroom stew?

414
00:34:53.468 --> 00:34:55.095
Alright. well. then tomorrow.

415
00:34:57.222 --> 00:34:58.265
Good.

416
00:35:01.101 --> 00:35:02.686
Don't fuck up. Paul.

417
00:35:03.729 --> 00:35:06.064
You. come on.
leave the girl alone.

418
00:35:15.532 --> 00:35:17.242
I don't like coming here.

419
00:35:17.242 --> 00:35:19.661
with Interpol watching
and everything.

420
00:35:19.661 --> 00:35:21.830
How are we gonna know
who they're watching?

421
00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:25.042
Yeah. but still.
puts you at risk.

422
00:35:25.042 --> 00:35:28.003
-That's why I have you.
-I guess.

423
00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:32.549
Did you get her number?

424
00:35:32.549 --> 00:35:34.384
Yeah. You want it?

425
00:35:48.023 --> 00:35:50.275
Take me back to the Reineart.

426
00:36:37.239 --> 00:36:38.699
What are you making?

427
00:36:39.491 --> 00:36:41.118
A doghouse?

428
00:36:41.118 --> 00:36:42.870
-A tree house?
-Hm-mm.

429
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:44.663
A monkey house?

430
00:36:45.873 --> 00:36:47.583
-No.
-Can I help?

431
00:36:47.583 --> 00:36:49.668
Not until you do your homework.

432
00:36:55.215 --> 00:36:56.341
Hi.

433
00:36:57.092 --> 00:36:59.761
-What are you doing?
-Keeping my hands busy.

434
00:36:59.761 --> 00:37:01.346
I don't like sitting still.

435
00:37:02.264 --> 00:37:03.599
Gotta keep moving.

436
00:37:03.599 --> 00:37:06.268
You need to keep busy
or to keep moving?

437
00:37:06.268 --> 00:37:08.645
Because. you know.
it's not the same thing.

438
00:37:11.315 --> 00:37:13.317
-Yeah.
-Hey.

439
00:37:13.317 --> 00:37:15.944
It's okay to slow down
once in a while.

440
00:37:15.944 --> 00:37:18.488
And this is a place
as good as any.

441
00:37:22.951 --> 00:37:25.287
You know what? Let's go out.

442
00:37:25.287 --> 00:37:26.371
Come.

443
00:37:30.459 --> 00:37:33.337
Hey. Matteo?

444
00:37:36.507 --> 00:37:37.758
Beautiful. huh?

445
00:37:41.261 --> 00:37:42.346
Yeah.

446
00:37:43.931 --> 00:37:45.766
"Remember death."

447
00:37:46.558 --> 00:37:49.061
I remember when you guys
got those.

448
00:37:49.061 --> 00:37:51.396
You thought you were so badass.

449
00:37:52.064 --> 00:37:53.774
Don't you think
it's kind of morbid?

450
00:37:56.276 --> 00:37:58.028
Why not "remember life"?

451
00:37:59.279 --> 00:38:00.531
Yeah.

452
00:38:02.324 --> 00:38:05.494
Come.
Don't be afraid. silly cat.

453
00:38:08.539 --> 00:38:12.125
Hey. welcome. Have a seat.

454
00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:26.807
Whoo!

455
00:38:32.855 --> 00:38:34.815
Look at your mom.

456
00:38:35.732 --> 00:38:38.819
Hi. Mommy.

457
00:38:49.079 --> 00:38:52.374
Earth to Moonbase 2. hello?
Anyone?

458
00:38:52.374 --> 00:38:53.458
What?

459
00:38:54.751 --> 00:38:58.255
You've been in your own world
since you got home.

460
00:38:58.255 --> 00:39:00.632
You didn't hear a thing
Angie told you about her day.

461
00:39:00.632 --> 00:39:03.510
-I heard her.
-But you weren't listening.

462
00:39:04.636 --> 00:39:06.054
She's a smart kid. Paul.

463
00:39:06.054 --> 00:39:08.390
She knows when you're not
paying attention.

464
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:11.727
Yeah. I'm sorry. Uh...

465
00:39:11.727 --> 00:39:14.521
But I've been trying
to figure out

466
00:39:14.521 --> 00:39:17.691
this accounting error at work.
You know how I get.

467
00:39:17.691 --> 00:39:20.652
Oh. yeah. All Beautiful Mind.

468
00:39:20.652 --> 00:39:22.529
Hey. you wanna talk about it?

469
00:39:23.697 --> 00:39:26.700
You wanna talk about
liabilities and equity with me?

470
00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:29.745
Mmm... Not if I don't have to.

471
00:39:29.745 --> 00:39:32.206
Aww...

472
00:40:19.962 --> 00:40:22.172
Welcome. ladies and gentlemen.

473
00:40:22.172 --> 00:40:25.467
to this beautiful tour
through Amsterdam.

474
00:40:25.467 --> 00:40:28.512
Also called
"the Venice of the North."

475
00:40:28.512 --> 00:40:34.810
where we have 165 canals
and 1.281 bridges.

476
00:40:36.937 --> 00:40:40.899
The Magere Brug is one of
our oldest. first built in 1691

477
00:40:40.899 --> 00:40:44.319
where two sisters lived
on opposite banks.

478
00:40:44.319 --> 00:40:47.281
This can be seen
on your left-hand side.

479
00:40:48.198 --> 00:40:50.576
After this bridge.
on your right.

480
00:40:50.576 --> 00:40:53.871
we have the famous...

481
00:41:06.008 --> 00:41:08.177
Oh my God!

482
00:41:08.177 --> 00:41:12.347
So. I guess we can
continue our business then.

483
00:41:12.347 --> 00:41:13.765
Yes. Mr Nay.

484
00:41:25.861 --> 00:41:27.696
Tell me something.
What do we know?

485
00:41:27.696 --> 00:41:29.114
Not much.

486
00:41:30.741 --> 00:41:33.577
-Did he flip Paul?
-He couldn't say.

487
00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:39.041
My money. Interpol.
a fucking rat.

488
00:41:39.041 --> 00:41:40.959
No way it's a coincidence.

489
00:41:40.959 --> 00:41:43.754
Maybe next time
don't cut out his tongue

490
00:41:43.754 --> 00:41:46.882
before he's done
answering my questions.

491
00:41:46.882 --> 00:41:48.592
You crazy fuck.

492
00:41:49.635 --> 00:41:51.637
You think that's funny?

493
00:41:51.637 --> 00:41:53.347
Don't make faces.

494
00:41:55.474 --> 00:41:57.226
Goddammit.

495
00:41:57.226 --> 00:41:59.228
I need my fucking pills.

496
00:41:59.228 --> 00:42:02.481
Sorry.
people. the bridge is closed.

497
00:42:02.481 --> 00:42:04.483
Sorry. guys.
the bridge is closed.

498
00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:08.570
What the hell.

499
00:42:09.613 --> 00:42:10.697
It's Roman.

500
00:42:12.658 --> 00:42:15.285
Yes. I see that.

501
00:42:22.459 --> 00:42:24.378
Bye. Daisy!

502
00:43:08.589 --> 00:43:13.218
It looks to be a bad day for a
new crypto-currency. Taltos.
At...

503
00:43:19.474 --> 00:43:22.769
Gabriel. I was just about
to call you.

504
00:43:22.769 --> 00:43:25.272
I need some good news. Paul.

505
00:43:25.272 --> 00:43:27.983
I'm having a very.
very stressful day.

506
00:43:27.983 --> 00:43:29.818
In fact. my doctor
standing in front of me

507
00:43:29.818 --> 00:43:32.738
tells me I have too much
anxiety. I need to relax.

508
00:43:32.738 --> 00:43:35.407
Actually. there has been
another complication.

509
00:43:35.407 --> 00:43:38.785
No! No. no. no. no. no.
There's no complication.

510
00:43:38.785 --> 00:43:40.996
There can't be.
because yesterday in your office

511
00:43:40.996 --> 00:43:43.999
you told me
you'd have my money today.

512
00:43:43.999 --> 00:43:45.834
You remember this. yes?

513
00:43:45.834 --> 00:43:47.503
Of course I remember.

514
00:43:47.503 --> 00:43:50.672
But it's proven to be a bit more
of a problem than I thought.

515
00:43:53.175 --> 00:43:56.136
Saban. you're there?
You still there?

516
00:43:56.136 --> 00:43:59.264
No. Paul. you did not lose me.

517
00:43:59.264 --> 00:44:01.016
I wanna know where the fuck
my money is

518
00:44:01.016 --> 00:44:02.935
that you're supposed to be
watching over.

519
00:44:03.727 --> 00:44:06.146
-You just got to trust me.
-Trust you?

520
00:44:06.146 --> 00:44:09.399
"Trust me" is what people say
before they sneak up behind you

521
00:44:09.399 --> 00:44:12.027
and they cut
your fucking throat.

522
00:44:12.027 --> 00:44:14.446
That's a lonely way to live.

523
00:44:14.446 --> 00:44:17.533
It's the only way
I live. Do you know why. Paul?

524
00:44:17.533 --> 00:44:20.953
Because betrayal
is around every corner. Paul.

525
00:44:20.953 --> 00:44:23.330
It's in every shadow.

526
00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:26.834
Find my money.

527
00:44:26.834 --> 00:44:29.169
Gabriel. I can fix this.

528
00:44:29.169 --> 00:44:31.380
I just need more time. Okay?

529
00:44:44.059 --> 00:44:46.395
Hey. come with me.

530
00:44:48.272 --> 00:44:50.440
-What's up?
-We have to visit a friend.

531
00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:51.525
Alright.

532
00:44:54.278 --> 00:44:55.779
...second quarter.

533
00:44:55.779 --> 00:44:58.782
I'd love to call what's
happening to Taltos a rug pull.

534
00:44:58.782 --> 00:45:01.785
but the market looks to pick up
over the next few months.

535
00:45:01.785 --> 00:45:04.204
-I don't have months.
-The summer. however.

536
00:45:04.204 --> 00:45:07.708
has been cruel to the whole
crypto market. By extension.

537
00:45:07.708 --> 00:45:10.711
the crypto-currencies have
also been severely impacted.

538
00:45:13.422 --> 00:45:16.008
You think
Saban's sending us a message?

539
00:45:17.134 --> 00:45:19.595
No. what makes you say that?

540
00:45:20.762 --> 00:45:22.347
Well...

541
00:45:22.347 --> 00:45:26.059
First. hanging the body here.
in a public place. And second...

542
00:45:27.394 --> 00:45:28.604
You're fucking with me.

543
00:45:28.604 --> 00:45:31.023
Of course it's a message.
you jackass.

544
00:45:31.023 --> 00:45:33.859
Or he would have stuffed him
in a barrel of concrete

545
00:45:33.859 --> 00:45:35.485
and dumped him off a boat.

546
00:45:46.747 --> 00:45:48.790
Hey. stop!

547
00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:50.792
Stop. Stop.

548
00:45:50.792 --> 00:45:51.919
Open it.

549
00:45:54.505 --> 00:45:58.300
Come on. come on.

550
00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:00.469
Fuck.

551
00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:03.889
Well. at least we know it works.

552
00:46:03.889 --> 00:46:07.226
Let's go back to the office.
Naomi in Cyber owes me a favor.

553
00:46:07.226 --> 00:46:10.062
Ooh. Naomi. She still single?

554
00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:15.275
What? Are you jealous?

555
00:46:20.322 --> 00:46:22.449
Did you get stung by a bee?

556
00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.284
No.

557
00:46:26.078 --> 00:46:27.996
This is just my body.

558
00:46:27.996 --> 00:46:29.289
But does that hurt?

559
00:46:34.461 --> 00:46:35.671
Sometimes.

560
00:46:37.798 --> 00:46:39.800
I need to tell you a secret.

561
00:46:59.862 --> 00:47:01.405
Hey.

562
00:47:01.405 --> 00:47:02.990
Hey. Hey. uhm.

563
00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:05.701
I need to sweet-talk
some investors tonight

564
00:47:05.701 --> 00:47:07.369
so I don't know
how late I'll be.

565
00:47:07.369 --> 00:47:09.204
You know
it's pizza night. right?

566
00:47:09.204 --> 00:47:12.040
Yeah. I know. I know.
Uh. save me a slice.

567
00:47:13.041 --> 00:47:15.502
Okay. Bye.

568
00:47:25.053 --> 00:47:27.222
Come on. Come on. come on.

569
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:30.642
It's Roman. Leave a message.

570
00:47:31.685 --> 00:47:34.605
It's Paul Woodley here. Uhm...

571
00:47:34.605 --> 00:47:36.148
I'm ready to deal.

572
00:47:47.242 --> 00:47:48.869
I have something for you.

573
00:47:52.539 --> 00:47:54.499
Do you like it?

574
00:47:54.499 --> 00:47:57.044
Yeah. I love it.

575
00:48:02.424 --> 00:48:05.511
I know you're probably ready
to get moving again. but...

576
00:48:06.553 --> 00:48:08.514
stick around. okay?

577
00:48:09.431 --> 00:48:12.434
I think John would want you
to get to know his daughter.

578
00:48:14.728 --> 00:48:17.564
Pretty face.

579
00:48:17.564 --> 00:48:20.359
Mommy.
can I have a slice right now?

580
00:48:20.359 --> 00:48:22.611
Yes. of course.
But watch the road.

581
00:48:22.611 --> 00:48:25.113
I'm just like Matteo.

582
00:48:27.449 --> 00:48:30.786
Oooh...

583
00:48:32.579 --> 00:48:36.208
Look at this goon.
As big as an ox.

584
00:48:37.167 --> 00:48:38.293
Break him.

585
00:48:40.337 --> 00:48:42.339
-Matteo!
-No!

586
00:48:42.339 --> 00:48:43.924
Don't hurt him!

587
00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:47.344
-Stop!
-Angie! No!

588
00:48:49.721 --> 00:48:52.099
Angie. into the car. Quick.

589
00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:54.852
Bitch.

590
00:48:54.852 --> 00:48:56.812
-Mom! Mommy!
-Fucker!

591
00:48:56.812 --> 00:48:58.480
-Get in the car.
-Let me go!

592
00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:01.733
-Zeeb. come on!
-See you around. ox.

593
00:49:01.733 --> 00:49:04.486
Matteo. she's in the car!

594
00:49:04.486 --> 00:49:06.446
-Go. go. go!
-Matteo!

595
00:49:06.446 --> 00:49:10.117
Oh. fuck. Give me your phone.
Give me your phone!

596
00:49:10.117 --> 00:49:11.827
Hey. that's my bike.

597
00:49:11.827 --> 00:49:13.620
Give me your phone!

598
00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:15.330
Hey. that's my phone!

599
00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:23.922
-Yeah. hello?
-They took Angie.

600
00:49:23.922 --> 00:49:26.633
Hey. okay. slow down. slow down.
Where are you?

601
00:49:26.633 --> 00:49:28.677
I don't know. They took her.

602
00:49:28.677 --> 00:49:30.637
-Paul. they took Angie.
-I'm on my way.

603
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:33.265
Son of a bitch!

604
00:49:33.265 --> 00:49:35.309
Matteo. help me!

605
00:49:43.692 --> 00:49:46.862
Goddammit!

606
00:49:55.662 --> 00:49:57.164
We have to split up.

607
00:49:57.164 --> 00:49:59.124
Move!

608
00:50:05.047 --> 00:50:08.509
Hello. Gabriel.
I told you I needed some time.

609
00:50:08.509 --> 00:50:12.679
I told you. Paul.
I don't like complications.

610
00:50:12.679 --> 00:50:15.265
You better let her go.
you son of a...

611
00:50:16.892 --> 00:50:19.186
Ah. goddammit!

612
00:50:27.277 --> 00:50:30.405
Mommy.

613
00:50:30.405 --> 00:50:32.616
Hey. Shut up.

614
00:50:37.746 --> 00:50:39.122
Aw shit. there he is.

615
00:50:41.124 --> 00:50:42.376
Who the heck is this guy?

616
00:50:44.503 --> 00:50:47.047
Get him off. Get him off!

617
00:50:50.801 --> 00:50:54.221
Where's the girl?

618
00:51:08.777 --> 00:51:11.655
Good job.

619
00:51:11.655 --> 00:51:14.491
Come on.

620
00:51:14.491 --> 00:51:16.994
Why are you still
doing this. old man?

621
00:51:16.994 --> 00:51:18.495
You calling me old?

622
00:51:18.495 --> 00:51:22.583
I'm talking about this.
This life. You got a wife.

623
00:51:22.583 --> 00:51:24.418
A kid on the way.

624
00:51:26.461 --> 00:51:28.714
Enough. enough.

625
00:51:30.257 --> 00:51:33.051
No. seriously.

626
00:51:33.969 --> 00:51:35.429
I know what you mean.

627
00:51:38.724 --> 00:51:40.434
Listen. we're family.

628
00:51:41.685 --> 00:51:43.270
You. me. Helene.

629
00:51:44.438 --> 00:51:45.939
And that kid. man.

630
00:51:46.857 --> 00:51:49.610
It's scaring the shit out of me
how soon it's gonna be here.

631
00:51:49.610 --> 00:51:51.028
You're gonna be a dad.

632
00:51:51.862 --> 00:51:54.406
Anyways. we're family.

633
00:51:55.741 --> 00:51:57.284
So are they.

634
00:51:58.827 --> 00:52:00.996
And they're family too.

635
00:52:00.996 --> 00:52:03.123
And we are all each other's got.

636
00:52:03.123 --> 00:52:06.335
And we are all that stands
between war and home.

637
00:52:06.335 --> 00:52:08.045
It's us.

638
00:52:08.045 --> 00:52:09.546
Yes. sir.

639
00:52:09.546 --> 00:52:11.173
And that's noble.

640
00:52:27.147 --> 00:52:28.941
I have to question him.

641
00:52:28.941 --> 00:52:30.776
When he wakes up.

642
00:52:30.776 --> 00:52:33.529
Why aren't you out there
trying to find my baby girl?

643
00:52:33.529 --> 00:52:35.906
-They're trying their best.
-Are you?

644
00:52:35.906 --> 00:52:37.324
We've got this.

645
00:52:37.324 --> 00:52:39.201
Agent Brasel. agent Fischer.
Interpol.

646
00:52:39.201 --> 00:52:42.204
-I have to call my captain.
-She already knows.

647
00:52:42.204 --> 00:52:43.497
Ms Woodley.

648
00:52:43.497 --> 00:52:45.707
getting your daughter back
is our top priority.

649
00:52:45.707 --> 00:52:47.543
We're setting up checkpoints
all across the city.

650
00:52:47.543 --> 00:52:49.545
A scooter won't get through
without us searching it.

651
00:52:49.545 --> 00:52:51.630
But I do need to ask him
some questions.

652
00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:53.507
Wait. Wait!

653
00:53:03.058 --> 00:53:05.227
Think I could get
some clothes on first?

654
00:53:06.061 --> 00:53:08.146
You got somewhere
you need to be?

655
00:53:10.899 --> 00:53:12.150
Yeah.

656
00:53:13.485 --> 00:53:15.070
Gotta get Angie back.

657
00:53:16.363 --> 00:53:18.448
How are you gonna do that?

658
00:53:18.448 --> 00:53:22.077
I'll start by doing your job and
find the people who took her.

659
00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:27.749
Those two guys
you turned into headstones

660
00:53:27.749 --> 00:53:29.668
were both Consociation.

661
00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:35.591
You thought this had
something to do with me.

662
00:53:35.591 --> 00:53:37.843
You're the unknown factor.

663
00:53:37.843 --> 00:53:40.888
No driver's license.
no home address. no cellphone.

664
00:53:40.888 --> 00:53:43.098
no bank accounts.
no fingerprints on file.

665
00:53:43.098 --> 00:53:48.312
not even a file really.
Except a name. Matteo Donner.

666
00:53:48.312 --> 00:53:51.940
And some redacted military
service. Nothing but a passport.

667
00:53:53.775 --> 00:53:55.569
What's the Consociation?

668
00:53:59.239 --> 00:54:01.491
It's like the NATO
of organized crime.

669
00:54:01.491 --> 00:54:03.869
An international alliance
of extortionists.

670
00:54:03.869 --> 00:54:06.496
murderers. counterfeiters.
you name it.

671
00:54:06.496 --> 00:54:09.750
And when you attack one.
you attack all of them.

672
00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:12.711
The branch that took Angie
is run by Gabriel Saban.

673
00:54:12.711 --> 00:54:16.798
What do they want?
Money?

674
00:54:16.798 --> 00:54:20.802
We're not sure.
This isn't their usual MO.

675
00:54:20.802 --> 00:54:24.014
Jesus. what is their usual MO?

676
00:54:24.014 --> 00:54:25.599
Young girls no one will miss.

677
00:54:27.059 --> 00:54:29.686
Snatch them off the streets.
drug them.

678
00:54:29.686 --> 00:54:32.147
ship them all over the world.

679
00:54:32.147 --> 00:54:34.316
But never a girl
as young as Angie.

680
00:54:34.316 --> 00:54:36.902
Not in this city
and certainly not so loud.

681
00:54:37.986 --> 00:54:39.446
So it's personal.

682
00:54:40.572 --> 00:54:42.115
You tell me.

683
00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:46.787
I don't know these guys.

684
00:54:50.541 --> 00:54:53.293
But I'll go make
some introductions.

685
00:54:53.293 --> 00:54:55.546
Keep talking like that and
we'll see if these still fit.

686
00:54:55.546 --> 00:54:57.673
Calm down. big guy.
we all want the same thing.

687
00:54:57.673 --> 00:55:01.510
So let us do our jobs.
You've created enough of a mess.

688
00:55:02.678 --> 00:55:07.015
But if any of you know anything.
now is the time to say so.

689
00:55:07.015 --> 00:55:10.435
We're monitoring your home.
phones. internet.

690
00:55:10.435 --> 00:55:12.312
We'll know if they make contact.

691
00:55:12.312 --> 00:55:15.232
What are we supposed to do.
just sit around and wait?

692
00:55:15.232 --> 00:55:17.234
Listen. I know this is hard.

693
00:55:17.234 --> 00:55:19.862
but I need you to trust us
and stay calm.

694
00:55:19.862 --> 00:55:22.698
How can I be calm. knowing
my little girl is out there

695
00:55:22.698 --> 00:55:24.616
terrified and alone? How?

696
00:55:24.616 --> 00:55:26.159
-Come on.
-Tell me.

697
00:55:26.159 --> 00:55:28.996
Come on. let's go home.
There's nothing we can do here.

698
00:55:28.996 --> 00:55:31.248
Calm down. It'll be okay.

699
00:55:31.248 --> 00:55:34.209
So you can reach her when you're
about to do something stupid.

700
00:55:37.963 --> 00:55:39.339
Thank you.

701
00:55:46.513 --> 00:55:50.726
This is all connected. isn't it?
Roman. Saban. the girl.

702
00:55:50.726 --> 00:55:54.396
I don't know.
But we're gonna find out.

703
00:55:56.023 --> 00:55:58.233
Letting him walk out of here
is like...

704
00:55:58.233 --> 00:56:00.235
putting a wildcat in your pants.

705
00:56:14.416 --> 00:56:15.667
Bye.

706
00:56:24.092 --> 00:56:25.093
Hi.

707
00:56:27.429 --> 00:56:29.139
What do you say
when someone says hello?

708
00:56:29.139 --> 00:56:31.767
Ber.

709
00:56:31.767 --> 00:56:34.561
Are you scared of that big guy?
I am.

710
00:56:35.312 --> 00:56:36.522
I'm Gabriel.

711
00:56:37.523 --> 00:56:39.525
I know you're afraid.
but you don't have to be.

712
00:56:39.525 --> 00:56:41.944
You're gonna go home
really soon. okay?

713
00:56:41.944 --> 00:56:43.028
Okay?

714
00:56:48.325 --> 00:56:49.660
Talk.

715
00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:51.620
Lo said that Interpol
was at the hospital.

716
00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:54.540
but the Woodley's didn't go
with them.

717
00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:56.959
I don't think Paul
told them anything.

718
00:56:56.959 --> 00:56:58.001
Okay. good.

719
00:56:58.794 --> 00:57:01.797
The Consociation wants the
Sindikheth's access to Thailand.

720
00:57:01.797 --> 00:57:03.632
We cannot lose that.
do you understand?

721
00:57:03.632 --> 00:57:05.676
I wanna go home.

722
00:57:05.676 --> 00:57:07.803
What am I gonna do
with this kid?

723
00:57:07.803 --> 00:57:09.054
I don't know.

724
00:57:09.054 --> 00:57:11.807
Maybe we can give her
to the Thais.

725
00:57:11.807 --> 00:57:15.352
Ber. what's wrong with you?

726
00:57:16.395 --> 00:57:17.980
It's actually not a bad idea.

727
00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:20.148
They like that kind of thing
over there.

728
00:57:22.484 --> 00:57:24.736
Do you want some juice.
sweetheart?

729
00:57:26.697 --> 00:57:28.448
A little juice?

730
00:57:38.834 --> 00:57:41.587
We've been talking about
that we wanted to ask you

731
00:57:41.587 --> 00:57:45.048
if you wanna be
our daughter's godfather.

732
00:57:45.716 --> 00:57:47.009
Are you serious?

733
00:57:47.009 --> 00:57:49.344
It means.
if something happens to me.

734
00:57:49.344 --> 00:57:51.722
then you're gonna watch
over her.

735
00:57:54.516 --> 00:57:56.351
I'd be honored.

736
00:57:56.351 --> 00:58:00.147
That's good. because. uh.
everybody else I asked said no.

737
00:58:02.524 --> 00:58:03.734
We're family.

738
00:58:08.238 --> 00:58:09.448
Here.

739
00:58:11.074 --> 00:58:14.786
-This will help you calm down.
-I don't want to calm down.

740
00:58:14.786 --> 00:58:16.455
-Drink some water.
-No.

741
00:58:22.711 --> 00:58:24.838
-Do you know the combination?
-What are you doing?

742
00:58:24.838 --> 00:58:27.841
There's only one way
to get Angie back alive.

743
00:58:27.841 --> 00:58:31.053
-I have to go get her.
-What do you mean. go get her?

744
00:58:31.053 --> 00:58:34.056
Six twelve. it's six twelve.
It's her birthday.

745
00:58:34.056 --> 00:58:36.558
Hey. Hey. whoa whoa whoa.

746
00:58:36.558 --> 00:58:38.769
You heard
what that Interpol agent said.

747
00:58:38.769 --> 00:58:41.438
She said Saban's got men
everywhere. Right?

748
00:58:41.438 --> 00:58:43.899
He's like this Eurotrash
fucking Tony Montana

749
00:58:43.899 --> 00:58:46.652
who's in bed with one of the
most ruthless gangs in Thailand.

750
00:58:46.652 --> 00:58:48.946
And if you attack one of them.
you attack them all.

751
00:58:48.946 --> 00:58:50.822
They're gonna kill us.
our friends.

752
00:58:50.822 --> 00:58:53.158
everyone we know.
Everyone we know!

753
00:58:53.158 --> 00:58:55.410
How do you know
he's connected to the Thai?

754
00:58:57.037 --> 00:58:58.247
The agent.

755
00:58:58.247 --> 00:59:00.832
She called it
the NATO of organized crime.

756
00:59:00.832 --> 00:59:03.168
She didn't say anything
about the Thai.

757
00:59:03.168 --> 00:59:05.254
I don't know. man.
You've got a concussion.

758
00:59:05.254 --> 00:59:07.840
-What's going on?
-He knows who took Angie.

759
00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:11.343
-What?
-Why didn't they ask for ransom?

760
00:59:11.343 --> 00:59:12.928
-How the hell should I know?
-Where is she?

761
00:59:12.928 --> 00:59:14.513
-I don't know!
-Stop!

762
00:59:14.513 --> 00:59:16.139
Stop!

763
00:59:16.139 --> 00:59:18.392
Where is she?! Where is she?!

764
00:59:18.392 --> 00:59:22.521
Okay. okay. okay. It's my fault.
It's my fault.

765
00:59:22.521 --> 00:59:23.981
You knew?

766
00:59:24.648 --> 00:59:26.233
Where is she?!

767
00:59:26.233 --> 00:59:28.485
I don't know.
I swear to Christ. I don't know.

768
00:59:28.485 --> 00:59:30.112
Why did they take her?!

769
00:59:30.112 --> 00:59:32.865
'Cause I took their money
and now they want it back.

770
00:59:32.865 --> 00:59:34.616
-Give it back to them!
-I don't have it.

771
00:59:34.616 --> 00:59:36.618
-How much?!
-15 million euros.

772
00:59:36.618 --> 00:59:38.620
So we just let them take her?

773
00:59:38.620 --> 00:59:41.248
You can't go to war
with these guys. you can't.

774
00:59:41.248 --> 00:59:43.959
Well. actually. I can.

775
00:59:45.627 --> 00:59:49.715
Helene. I'm so sorry.
Helene. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

776
00:59:58.473 --> 01:00:00.517
Oh. shit.

777
01:00:00.517 --> 01:00:04.104
Call Saban. Tell him
you have the money.

778
01:00:04.104 --> 01:00:06.523
and make sure he believes you.

779
01:00:06.523 --> 01:00:10.068
I'm sure you can understand
my hesitation. Paul.

780
01:00:11.403 --> 01:00:13.989
Explain to me again how you
managed to pull this off.

781
01:00:13.989 --> 01:00:17.826
I've been skimming off
my other clients for years

782
01:00:17.826 --> 01:00:21.955
and I've kept a lot of it
liquidated.

783
01:00:22.873 --> 01:00:26.877
I just want Angie back. Gabriel.
I'll do whatever it takes.

784
01:00:26.877 --> 01:00:29.213
How much? Huh?

785
01:00:30.005 --> 01:00:32.090
How much have you taken
from assholes like me

786
01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:33.675
who trusted you?

787
01:00:33.675 --> 01:00:35.469
More than I ever needed.

788
01:00:36.386 --> 01:00:39.181
You're gonna bring it to me.
All of it.

789
01:00:40.265 --> 01:00:43.936
And. Paul. if you lie to me.
you try to fuck me.

790
01:00:44.853 --> 01:00:46.647
I will kill everything you love.

791
01:00:46.647 --> 01:00:49.233
Slow.

792
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:51.610
Do you understand?

793
01:00:52.528 --> 01:00:53.612
Bring it to me.

794
01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:56.448
Okay. I will.

795
01:01:04.373 --> 01:01:07.042
There's a construction site
in Westpoort.

796
01:01:07.042 --> 01:01:10.212
You're gonna meet Saban's men
there for the exchange.

797
01:01:20.556 --> 01:01:23.225
I just made a...

798
01:01:23.225 --> 01:01:25.269
...bad bet.

799
01:01:26.854 --> 01:01:30.232
-It's just bad luck.
-Bad luck?

800
01:01:41.952 --> 01:01:43.412
He's lying.

801
01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:46.498
No shit.

802
01:01:47.583 --> 01:01:50.377
That's why you're gonna put
an end to this mess. now.

803
01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:01.180
It won't be so bad.

804
01:02:02.431 --> 01:02:05.392
You see. I was an orphan once.

805
01:02:06.101 --> 01:02:08.604
Look how strong it made me.

806
01:02:20.365 --> 01:02:23.118
Please. bring her home.

807
01:02:24.494 --> 01:02:25.996
I'm gonna kill them all.

808
01:02:33.795 --> 01:02:35.297
Yeah?

809
01:02:35.297 --> 01:02:39.009
Naomi was able to get into
Roman's phone. Listen to this.

810
01:02:39.009 --> 01:02:42.387
It's Paul
Woodley here. I'm ready to deal.

811
01:02:42.387 --> 01:02:45.390
But I want immunity
and protection for my family.

812
01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:47.643
-I'll give you anything...
-Son of a bitch.

813
01:02:47.643 --> 01:02:49.811
Don't let him leave that house.

814
01:02:49.811 --> 01:02:51.104
I'm on it.

815
01:02:52.481 --> 01:02:54.900
Yeah. I'm gonna need
to call you back.

816
01:02:58.403 --> 01:02:59.655
Out.

817
01:03:03.784 --> 01:03:06.036
God... Fuck.

818
01:03:06.036 --> 01:03:07.454
Agent Fischer?

819
01:03:07.996 --> 01:03:09.248
Want some coffee?

820
01:03:10.791 --> 01:03:12.084
Come in.

821
01:03:16.922 --> 01:03:18.298
Is your husband home?

822
01:03:19.424 --> 01:03:21.385
Are you going to arrest him?

823
01:03:25.305 --> 01:03:26.640
He's upstairs.

824
01:03:30.978 --> 01:03:31.979
Mr Woodley?

825
01:03:33.313 --> 01:03:35.858
Can you come
down here please?

826
01:03:38.485 --> 01:03:41.321
Yeah. Just a second.

827
01:04:04.803 --> 01:04:06.430
What's gonna happen to him?

828
01:04:08.932 --> 01:04:12.186
Depends on what he knew.
And when he knew it.

829
01:04:20.777 --> 01:04:22.237
Is that decaf?

830
01:04:42.049 --> 01:04:45.552
Holy shit. It's the ox.

831
01:04:47.179 --> 01:04:51.391
That was a real dick move
you did to my guys.

832
01:04:51.391 --> 01:04:53.769
The risks
of being a soldier. eh?

833
01:04:53.769 --> 01:04:55.771
You're not a soldier.

834
01:04:55.771 --> 01:04:58.941
No? Tomato. to-mah-to. Whatever.

835
01:05:00.275 --> 01:05:02.486
-Is that the money?
-The money's here.

836
01:05:03.362 --> 01:05:04.530
Where's Angie?

837
01:05:04.530 --> 01:05:07.533
-Mm? Who's Angie?
-The girl.

838
01:05:07.533 --> 01:05:10.369
We're supposed to make a trade.
The money for her.

839
01:05:11.411 --> 01:05:13.956
I don't know anything
about a trade.

840
01:05:13.956 --> 01:05:16.792
Whoa whoa whoa.

841
01:05:16.792 --> 01:05:18.627
We didn't bring her.

842
01:05:21.797 --> 01:05:25.968
The deal was. you bring us the
money and the girl doesn't die.

843
01:05:25.968 --> 01:05:27.678
You brought us the money

844
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:31.431
and you have our word
she's not gonna die.

845
01:05:33.350 --> 01:05:35.686
Now you know how we do deals.

846
01:05:40.065 --> 01:05:42.818
What? You wanna do something?
Huh?

847
01:05:43.694 --> 01:05:45.362
Look at the ox.

848
01:05:45.362 --> 01:05:48.156
Comes here. thinking
he's gonna do something.

849
01:05:48.156 --> 01:05:51.577
But he sees all
of us and knows...

850
01:05:52.828 --> 01:05:54.538
he's no hero.

851
01:06:00.335 --> 01:06:02.004
Yeah.

852
01:06:02.004 --> 01:06:04.298
See you in the next life. ox.

853
01:06:08.010 --> 01:06:09.553
What happens to Angie?

854
01:06:11.471 --> 01:06:15.392
Some lucky prince is gonna
make her a happy princess.

855
01:06:17.311 --> 01:06:18.520
Kill him.

856
01:06:29.698 --> 01:06:31.700
Shit.

857
01:07:21.416 --> 01:07:25.003
Mr Woodley? Mr Woodley?

858
01:07:25.003 --> 01:07:28.257
I really need you
to come down now. We gotta...

859
01:07:37.099 --> 01:07:38.225
Easy.

860
01:07:39.601 --> 01:07:40.769
Easy.

861
01:07:44.982 --> 01:07:46.191
Let her go.

862
01:07:55.993 --> 01:07:57.202
Son of a bitch!

863
01:08:04.751 --> 01:08:06.712
Wanna play. motherfucker?

864
01:08:07.588 --> 01:08:10.757
Let's play.

865
01:08:26.565 --> 01:08:28.150
Hello. we need an ambulance.

866
01:08:28.150 --> 01:08:31.612
There's an officer down.
Please. hurry! Hurry. please!

867
01:08:33.155 --> 01:08:35.824
Paul. where are you?!

868
01:08:35.824 --> 01:08:36.950
Paul?!

869
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:38.827
Ready to be a hero?

870
01:08:38.827 --> 01:08:41.330
You think you scare me?
You don't fucking scare me.

871
01:08:41.330 --> 01:08:46.168
Stop moving.

872
01:08:46.168 --> 01:08:48.003
This doesn't mean shit.

873
01:08:48.003 --> 01:08:51.924
We'll find you and
we'll cut your fucking head off.

874
01:08:51.924 --> 01:08:53.509
And that little bitch.

875
01:08:53.509 --> 01:08:58.055
We'll send her somewhere
they use girls like Kleenex.

876
01:08:58.055 --> 01:09:02.893
I didn't move.

877
01:09:02.893 --> 01:09:05.479
I know. But you were talking.

878
01:09:08.690 --> 01:09:12.027
I know what this is.

879
01:09:12.027 --> 01:09:13.946
It's some stupid theater.

880
01:09:25.624 --> 01:09:28.252
Stop. Stop!

881
01:09:28.252 --> 01:09:29.795
Stop!

882
01:09:40.347 --> 01:09:43.976
I'm only gonna ask once.
Where's the girl?

883
01:09:48.564 --> 01:09:50.941
Fuck you.

884
01:09:52.609 --> 01:09:54.236
Okay.

885
01:10:03.829 --> 01:10:07.291
She's at the Reinaert!
She's at the Reinaert!

886
01:10:15.757 --> 01:10:19.469
She's at the Reinaert.
in the Red Light District.

887
01:10:20.512 --> 01:10:24.892
See? You can be a hero.

888
01:10:24.892 --> 01:10:26.768
But it's not gonna save you.

889
01:10:35.444 --> 01:10:38.071
Hold this here. Press.

890
01:10:38.071 --> 01:10:39.448
Paul!

891
01:10:40.574 --> 01:10:42.367
Okay. breathe. Look at me.

892
01:10:42.367 --> 01:10:44.661
Look at me.

893
01:10:47.456 --> 01:10:48.832
Give me a hand.

894
01:10:52.127 --> 01:10:54.588
Mr... Mr Woodley.

895
01:10:56.298 --> 01:10:57.841
You're under arrest.

896
01:10:58.967 --> 01:11:02.262
-Give me a hand. please!
-No. I. uh...

897
01:11:03.847 --> 01:11:05.432
I'm sorry.

898
01:11:06.683 --> 01:11:08.310
You son of a bitch.

899
01:11:11.355 --> 01:11:14.233
He's a bit
of an asshole. isn't he?

900
01:11:34.962 --> 01:11:37.422
Listen.

901
01:11:37.422 --> 01:11:40.008
I don't know
what they're paying you.

902
01:11:40.008 --> 01:11:42.845
but I have a lot of money
in that bag and I can get more.

903
01:11:42.845 --> 01:11:44.137
Enough for both of us. man.

904
01:11:54.815 --> 01:11:56.024
Fischer.

905
01:11:57.276 --> 01:11:58.610
Fischer.

906
01:12:03.532 --> 01:12:06.535
-Oh my God.
-The ambulance is on the way.

907
01:12:06.535 --> 01:12:09.496
Oh my God. You. idiot.

908
01:12:10.330 --> 01:12:12.916
If you die. I'll kill you.

909
01:12:12.916 --> 01:12:15.169
You think I'm gonna get a medal?

910
01:12:15.752 --> 01:12:16.920
Yes.

911
01:12:32.728 --> 01:12:33.896
Yes?

912
01:12:33.896 --> 01:12:35.397
Angie is at the club Reineart.

913
01:12:35.397 --> 01:12:37.107
Donner. I told you
to stand down.

914
01:12:37.107 --> 01:12:38.692
Bring backup.

915
01:12:39.401 --> 01:12:40.569
Donner?

916
01:12:45.616 --> 01:12:48.410
-Please stay with him.
-Okay. Where are you going?

917
01:12:48.410 --> 01:12:49.870
To do something stupid.

918
01:13:05.761 --> 01:13:08.972
They're not answering.

919
01:13:11.016 --> 01:13:12.893
They're probably all dead.

920
01:13:13.727 --> 01:13:15.103
Yeah.

921
01:13:28.825 --> 01:13:30.410
That's it?

922
01:13:32.663 --> 01:13:34.414
Get that thing
off my fucking desk.

923
01:13:45.592 --> 01:13:47.052
Hi. sweetie.

924
01:13:47.803 --> 01:13:52.015
Oh... I'm gonna sit
right next to you. sweetheart.

925
01:13:55.185 --> 01:13:59.398
You know. your friend.
the big. big guy.

926
01:13:59.398 --> 01:14:01.525
-What's his name?
-Matteo.

927
01:14:01.525 --> 01:14:05.279
Matteo. That's a cool name.

928
01:14:05.279 --> 01:14:09.324
And Matteo.
he's friends with your dad?

929
01:14:09.324 --> 01:14:12.828
Not Paul. but my real dad.

930
01:14:12.828 --> 01:14:15.205
Oh. your real dad.

931
01:14:15.998 --> 01:14:17.332
Mmm.

932
01:14:18.083 --> 01:14:21.837
Do you think he's gonna
come here and come get you?

933
01:14:21.837 --> 01:14:23.714
-Yeah.
-You do?

934
01:14:25.591 --> 01:14:28.385
I've seen this man. boss.

935
01:14:28.385 --> 01:14:30.512
I don't think
he gives up easily.

936
01:14:30.512 --> 01:14:31.847
Mmm.

937
01:14:32.639 --> 01:14:36.602
Okay. Well. then I guess
we should let him come. huh?

938
01:14:37.853 --> 01:14:39.521
Matteo?

939
01:14:39.521 --> 01:14:40.981
Yeah.

940
01:14:56.205 --> 01:14:58.332
Do you have a reservation?

941
01:15:24.775 --> 01:15:26.902
You're not going up. my friend.

942
01:15:26.902 --> 01:15:30.239
You want a girl.
all you need to do is ask.

943
01:15:30.239 --> 01:15:32.658
I'm not looking
for one of these girls.

944
01:15:32.658 --> 01:15:34.910
Tell your boss I'm here
to see him.

945
01:15:36.286 --> 01:15:39.831
All you're gonna see
is the inside of a coffin.

946
01:15:43.794 --> 01:15:48.131
-Last chance.
-Seriously. huh?

947
01:16:08.777 --> 01:16:10.737
Move it. Move it!

948
01:16:12.072 --> 01:16:13.574
Out of my way.

949
01:16:16.243 --> 01:16:17.995
You keep her quiet now.

950
01:16:41.226 --> 01:16:42.728
Take him down.
Take him down.

951
01:16:48.525 --> 01:16:51.904
I thought
you were gonna bring backup.

952
01:16:51.904 --> 01:16:54.781
I am the backup.

953
01:17:08.712 --> 01:17:10.005
We have to leave now.

954
01:17:10.005 --> 01:17:12.341
-Come on. Go. go. go. go.
-No! No!

955
01:17:12.341 --> 01:17:14.009
-Come.
-Let me go!

956
01:17:14.009 --> 01:17:16.345
-I go too. Please.
-Hey!

957
01:17:16.345 --> 01:17:18.430
-Don't hurt her!
-Easy.

958
01:17:46.542 --> 01:17:49.545
You good?

959
01:17:49.545 --> 01:17:52.756
Fuck. yeah.

960
01:17:58.804 --> 01:18:01.431
Put an end to this. Now.

961
01:18:03.058 --> 01:18:04.476
See you later.

962
01:18:07.563 --> 01:18:10.899
-Where's the girl?!
-That way. To the roof.

963
01:18:10.899 --> 01:18:13.193
They went to the roof.

964
01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:25.289
Where are you taking me?

965
01:18:25.289 --> 01:18:26.999
Shut up.

966
01:18:29.168 --> 01:18:30.627
I don't wanna go.

967
01:18:31.420 --> 01:18:35.048
What did I tell you?
Shut up and keep moving.

968
01:18:47.603 --> 01:18:49.646
I don't think so.

969
01:19:14.296 --> 01:19:16.089
-No.
-Come. come.

970
01:19:16.089 --> 01:19:18.675
-I don't want to.
-Come!

971
01:19:23.972 --> 01:19:26.391
Come on!

972
01:19:59.591 --> 01:20:02.469
-No. I hate you.
-Come. Come.

973
01:20:02.469 --> 01:20:05.055
-No!
-Come! Come!

974
01:21:50.661 --> 01:21:52.120
Don't follow me.

975
01:21:53.247 --> 01:21:54.623
Well. you got my number.

976
01:21:56.792 --> 01:22:01.004
You motherfuckers.

977
01:22:04.258 --> 01:22:07.261
Hey. Stop.

978
01:22:11.139 --> 01:22:12.975
Where do you think you're going?

979
01:22:14.434 --> 01:22:15.644
Huh?

980
01:22:16.478 --> 01:22:19.815
Behave yourself. You got that?

981
01:22:22.067 --> 01:22:23.277
Saban!

982
01:22:23.861 --> 01:22:25.279
No!

983
01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:30.492
-I'll kill her.
-Give me the girl.

984
01:22:30.492 --> 01:22:31.910
Don't be stupid.

985
01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:37.124
Just give me the girl
and I'll let you walk away.

986
01:22:37.124 --> 01:22:39.459
You'll let me walk away?

987
01:22:39.459 --> 01:22:41.920
That's a knife. That's a gun.

988
01:22:43.130 --> 01:22:45.507
Come any closer and I'll blow
her fucking brains out.

989
01:22:45.507 --> 01:22:48.510
-I swear to God.
-Give me the girl.

990
01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:36.517
Matteo! Are you okay?

991
01:23:38.393 --> 01:23:40.270
Yeah. I'm okay.

992
01:23:42.231 --> 01:23:44.358
-Did he hurt you?
-No.

993
01:23:46.235 --> 01:23:49.530
Thank you.

994
01:23:51.198 --> 01:23:53.700
-Let's go home.
-Yeah.

995
01:24:17.975 --> 01:24:20.269
Daisy. let's play.

996
01:24:20.269 --> 01:24:22.312
You're so cute.

997
01:24:26.942 --> 01:24:29.069
I'm gonna get you a pillow.

998
01:24:37.744 --> 01:24:40.247
Do you think
Matteo will come back?

999
01:24:40.247 --> 01:24:42.332
Yeah. I think so. honey.

1000
01:24:43.584 --> 01:24:44.918
I like that.

1001
01:24:50.966 --> 01:24:53.343
Good girl. Yes.

1002
01:24:53.343 --> 01:24:55.596
Oh.

1003
01:27:03.891 --> 01:27:05.350
You happy now?

1004
01:27:07.895 --> 01:27:11.064
Now get your ass up.
We got work to do.
