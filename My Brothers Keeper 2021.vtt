90
00:04:24.632 --> 00:04:25.733
* With the old white forces

91
00:04:25.733 --> 00:04:28.135
* I had the orange jumpsuit on

92
00:04:28.135 --> 00:04:29.737
* You gotta think

93
00:04:29.737 --> 00:04:31.104
* 'Cause the greed
wouldn't lead you home *

94
00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:34.775
* I cut ties with them guys

95
00:04:39.413 --> 00:04:42.983
- So I spoke with the lab tech.

96
00:04:44.418 --> 00:04:46.320
and he says since we chose
to expedite everything.

97
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.389
and do the same day testing.

98
00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.992
we should have the results
by the end of the day.

99
00:04:51.992 --> 00:04:52.826
- Cool.

100
00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.532
I appreciate you doing
this. man. seriously.

101
00:05:01.101 --> 00:05:02.302
- It's no problem.

102
00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:03.437
It's no problem at all.

103
00:05:07.274 --> 00:05:10.578
So you hungry?

104
00:05:10.578 --> 00:05:11.779

105
00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:13.447
I'm always hungry.

106
00:05:13.447 --> 00:05:14.682
Can you hear my
stomach growling.

107
00:05:14.682 --> 00:05:17.585
- Ah. man. see you might
not even need no test.

108
00:05:17.585 --> 00:05:18.952
You already sound like
my brother for real.

109
00:05:18.952 --> 00:05:20.688
- (chuckles) Yeah. word. man.

110
00:05:20.688 --> 00:05:21.922
What are we tryna get.

111
00:05:21.922 --> 00:05:23.824
- Look man. I got just
the thing in mind. man.

112
00:05:23.824 --> 00:05:24.658
- Okay.

113
00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:27.227
(upbeat music)

114
00:05:45.746 --> 00:05:47.748
Now. this snack is good.

115
00:05:49.717 --> 00:05:51.419
- Actually I have
my chefs set a side

116
00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:52.720
some signatures for us.

117
00:05:54.922 --> 00:05:56.223
- You got a personal chef?

118
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.125
- Mm-hmm.

119
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.529
- Must be nice.

120
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.500
- I mean. I guess the
only real reason I got one

121
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.968
is so I wouldn't overindulge.

122
00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:13.006
I used to be overweight.

123
00:06:13.006 --> 00:06:15.242
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

124
00:06:15.242 --> 00:06:17.411
- Looking at you. man. I
could have never guessed that.

125
00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:22.382
- That comes from a bunch
of hard work. dedication.

126
00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:25.786
and push aways?
- Push aways?

127
00:06:25.786 --> 00:06:27.955
- You know. when you got a
table full of unhealthy food.

128
00:06:27.955 --> 00:06:29.657
and you just gotta
push that shit away.

129
00:06:29.657 --> 00:06:33.594
- (laughs) Thanks. I know
what you mean. (chuckles)

130
00:06:33.594 --> 00:06:38.599
- Yeah. man. but I used to
have high blood pressure.

131
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.504
prediabetes. you know. the
list just goes on and on. man.

132
00:06:45.005 --> 00:06:47.608
My doctor said that if I
didn't change my eating habits

133
00:06:47.608 --> 00:06:50.243
then I wouldn't even make
it to see my 30th birthday.

134
00:06:51.311 --> 00:06:52.513
- Wow.

135
00:06:52.513 --> 00:06:55.115
- Yeah. man. that scared
the hell out of me.

136
00:06:55.115 --> 00:06:57.918
So I started doing research
on the best schools

137
00:06:57.918 --> 00:07:00.020
for my body type
and my blood type.

138
00:07:02.222 --> 00:07:05.292
Started working out
and eating healthier.

139
00:07:05.292 --> 00:07:07.160
hence why I have
a personal chef.

140
00:07:09.563 --> 00:07:10.498
Here I am today.

141
00:07:12.032 --> 00:07:12.966
- And here you are.

142
00:07:15.402 --> 00:07:18.271
Well. I must say I'm
glad you made a decision

143
00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:19.540
to change your life. bro.

144
00:07:20.474 --> 00:07:22.409
because if you didn't.

145
00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:23.410
you may not be here.

146
00:07:25.846 --> 00:07:26.814
and I wouldn't have
the opportunity to meet

147
00:07:26.814 --> 00:07:28.415
and get to know you.

148
00:07:30.984 --> 00:07:31.919
My brother.

149
00:07:33.053 --> 00:07:36.156
(mellow piano music)

150
00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:20.233
- Hey.
- Oh. hey. Ms. Thing.

151
00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:23.671
Okay. so that man of yours
must be doing something right.

152
00:08:23.671 --> 00:08:26.339
because you were
smiling from ear to ear.

153
00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.576
- You know. I could just
be happy to be alive.

154
00:08:28.576 --> 00:08:29.810
- That could be
it. but it's not.

155
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.879
so are you going
to spill the tea?

156
00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:33.781
- You're so stupid.

157
00:08:33.781 --> 00:08:35.983
- So you're not gonna
tell me what's going on?

158
00:08:35.983 --> 00:08:37.651
You're not gonna tell
me how it's going?

159
00:08:37.651 --> 00:08:41.589
- (scoffs) I mean.
it's a wonderful.

160
00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:43.056
(both giggling)

161
00:08:43.056 --> 00:08:46.560
Like he's so intelligent.
and ambitious.

162
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.862
and he is sexy as hell.

163
00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:50.598
like I can't stop smiling.

164
00:08:50.598 --> 00:08:51.498
- I see.

165
00:08:51.498 --> 00:08:53.300
(both chuckling)

166
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.704
- Like I just. I dunno. I
love the way I feel with him.

167
00:08:56.704 --> 00:08:57.638
You know?

168
00:08:57.638 --> 00:08:58.872
Like I feel wanted. and needed.

169
00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:01.441
and he's changed my
perspective on things.

170
00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:03.476
and I see things differently.

171
00:09:03.476 --> 00:09:06.013
like I'm actually happy.

172
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.582
You know. I think I'm gonna
try and keep this one.

173
00:09:08.582 --> 00:09:10.450
- Sounds like you should.

174
00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:12.586
- (chuckles) All Right.
so how are you doing.

175
00:09:12.586 --> 00:09:14.622
what's going on in your life?

176
00:09:14.622 --> 00:09:15.823
- Girl. nothing new.

177
00:09:15.823 --> 00:09:18.158
Same old. same old. work. home.

178
00:09:18.158 --> 00:09:21.461
- So nothing new or
exciting in your life?

179
00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:25.165
(peaceful music)

180
00:09:29.536 --> 00:09:31.204
- No. nothing new.

181
00:09:31.204 --> 00:09:32.205
nothing at all.

182
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.574
- Okay.

183
00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:36.777
- Look. I am sorry
my life is so boring.

184
00:09:36.777 --> 00:09:37.878
That's why I have you.

185
00:09:37.878 --> 00:09:40.447
so I can life
carelessly through you.

186
00:09:40.447 --> 00:09:43.651
So tell me more about
this fine man. mh.

187
00:09:43.651 --> 00:09:45.452
- Okay. so last night he
did the same on his tongue.

188
00:09:45.452 --> 00:09:46.453
- Ooh. girl.

189
00:09:48.021 --> 00:09:49.757
Wait a minute.

190
00:09:49.757 --> 00:09:52.525
(peaceful music)

191
00:10:08.842 --> 00:10:10.510
- How'd you find me?

192
00:10:14.347 --> 00:10:16.016
I know this might sound silly.

193
00:10:16.016 --> 00:10:17.450
Being that we're
all up in my house.

194
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.319
and we're practically strangers.

195
00:10:19.319 --> 00:10:20.721
I realize I probably
shoulda asked you

196
00:10:20.721 --> 00:10:21.955
that a bit sooner.

197
00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:23.356
but I was just so shocked.

198
00:10:24.825 --> 00:10:26.994
But seriously though
what made you find me?

199
00:10:32.299 --> 00:10:34.101
- I grew up in a
foster care system.

200
00:10:35.568 --> 00:10:37.070
Never knew who my parents were.

201
00:10:39.272 --> 00:10:41.408
I would go to school
and see my classmates

202
00:10:41.408 --> 00:10:42.275
and their siblings

203
00:10:43.844 --> 00:10:46.479
and I will always wondered
what it would be like

204
00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:47.848
to have a brother or sister.

205
00:10:51.051 --> 00:10:54.454
to have somebody who maybe
look like me. you know.

206
00:10:56.256 --> 00:10:57.657
to share the same genetics.

207
00:11:00.327 --> 00:11:02.095
I always feel so
alone in this world.

208
00:11:05.699 --> 00:11:07.835
so one day I got
tired of that feeling.

209
00:11:07.835 --> 00:11:09.036
I did some digging. bro.

210
00:11:11.204 --> 00:11:14.708
and that's when I finally found
my birth father's real name.

211
00:11:14.708 --> 00:11:18.946
our father. Clifford Montgomery.

212
00:11:21.481 --> 00:11:23.751
and that's how I found you.

213
00:11:27.755 --> 00:11:28.588
- I see.

214
00:11:30.623 --> 00:11:33.160
- I mean. I wasn't gonna
reach out at first.

215
00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.362
I know how crazy it seems
some random claiming

216
00:11:35.362 --> 00:11:36.730
to be your brother and all.

217
00:11:37.965 --> 00:11:39.399
The thoughts and assumptions

218
00:11:39.399 --> 00:11:42.169
to which you may have been
thinking begin to cloud my mind.

219
00:11:42.169 --> 00:11:44.004
like what do you want?

220
00:11:44.004 --> 00:11:48.976
Clout. money. an organ 'cause
he's sick or something?

221
00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:57.084
Nah. it's my yearning.

222
00:11:57.084 --> 00:11:58.551
My yearning to
connect with somebody

223
00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:01.521
who share the same bloodline
as me overpowered all

224
00:12:01.521 --> 00:12:02.389
of that fear.

225
00:12:03.824 --> 00:12:07.160
and that's when I decided to
reach out and contact you.

226
00:12:16.403 --> 00:12:18.471
- Well. I'm glad you did.

227
00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.175
- Yeah. I'm glad I did too.

228
00:12:26.379 --> 00:12:29.482
(mellow piano music)

229
00:12:41.829 --> 00:12:43.430
- All right girl.
I'ma call you later.

230
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.065
- All right you better.

231
00:12:45.065 --> 00:12:46.499
- (chuckles) I will.

232
00:12:46.499 --> 00:12:49.502
- I'm gonna own one on you here.

233
00:12:49.502 --> 00:12:52.572
(mellow piano music)

234
00:13:26.506 --> 00:13:29.409
- So do you have
a last name. Lexi?

235
00:13:31.511 --> 00:13:33.613
- It's just Lexi.

236
00:13:33.613 --> 00:13:37.484
- Well. mine's Montgomery.
- Nice to meet you.

237
00:13:37.484 --> 00:13:39.419
Brandon Montgomery.

238
00:13:39.419 --> 00:13:42.489
(mellow piano music)

239
00:13:49.129 --> 00:13:52.199
- So I still can't
get a last name. huh?

240
00:13:52.199 --> 00:13:55.302
(mellow piano music)

241
00:14:17.024 --> 00:14:19.026
- So what was he like...

242
00:14:21.094 --> 00:14:23.997
growing up with
him as your father?

243
00:14:27.434 --> 00:14:31.905
- You know. that
loneliness that you spoke

244
00:14:31.905 --> 00:14:33.040
of being in the system?

245
00:14:34.774 --> 00:14:38.211
I experienced that
loneliness every single day.

246
00:14:38.211 --> 00:14:39.379
that man was alive.

247
00:14:43.283 --> 00:14:48.021
That man cared way more about
his company than he did me.

248
00:14:49.656 --> 00:14:53.961
especially after my mom
died when I was two.

249
00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:56.729
She has lupus.

250
00:14:58.698 --> 00:14:59.967
- I'm sorry to hear that.

251
00:15:01.468 --> 00:15:02.302
- Yeah. man.

252
00:15:05.372 --> 00:15:07.907
I just feel like
after my mom died.

253
00:15:10.677 --> 00:15:13.180
he just didn't know
how to love anymore.

254
00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:14.647
He didn't know how
to love anymore.

255
00:15:14.647 --> 00:15:19.452
and you just use that company
as a way to mask the pain

256
00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.454
that he was going through.

257
00:15:22.956 --> 00:15:24.391
And instead of me understanding

258
00:15:24.391 --> 00:15:25.892
what my dad was going through.

259
00:15:28.361 --> 00:15:29.529
it made me resent him.

260
00:15:30.663 --> 00:15:31.898
him and that company.

261
00:15:36.003 --> 00:15:38.638
You know that's why I sold it.

262
00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.209
I got rid of it as
soon as I could.

263
00:15:44.144 --> 00:15:46.913
I just wanted to get
rid of the very thing

264
00:15:46.913 --> 00:15:48.148
that ruined my family.

265
00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:52.219
The very thing that
made me feel so alone.

266
00:15:56.956 --> 00:16:01.894
- Damn. this whole time we
were sharing the same feelings

267
00:16:03.263 --> 00:16:05.198
of loneliness and abandonment.

268
00:16:07.267 --> 00:16:09.136
I wonder what else
we have in common.

269
00:16:10.703 --> 00:16:13.206
(phone rings)

270
00:16:14.741 --> 00:16:15.575
- Just a second.

271
00:16:19.246 --> 00:16:20.080
Hello?

272
00:16:27.687 --> 00:16:29.022
Okay. thank you.

273
00:16:33.093 --> 00:16:36.763
Well. hopefully we get
a chance to find out.

274
00:16:38.565 --> 00:16:39.799
results are in.

275
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.803
(suspenseful music)

276
00:17:51.804 --> 00:17:53.706
- [Man] Question. how
much longer do you think

277
00:17:53.706 --> 00:17:55.775
you can keep going on like this?

278
00:17:55.775 --> 00:17:57.043
You call yourself brother.

279
00:17:57.043 --> 00:17:57.977
but in both sense
isn't accountable.

280
00:17:57.977 --> 00:17:59.212
but you're only doing this.

281
00:17:59.212 --> 00:18:00.012
so you can let the
hot wax burn you all

282
00:18:00.012 --> 00:18:01.080
over your arm and wrist.

283
00:18:04.016 --> 00:18:07.954
- Well. I guess I'll
see you tomorrow...

284
00:18:10.056 --> 00:18:11.224
brother.

285
00:18:11.224 --> 00:18:13.793
- (chuckles) Looking
forward to it.

286
00:18:13.793 --> 00:18:16.563
Brother.
- Yeah. me too.

287
00:18:16.563 --> 00:18:19.566
(suspenseful music)

288
00:18:36.716 --> 00:18:40.220
(sighs) You son of a bitch.

289
00:18:43.156 --> 00:18:45.458
At least one good thing
came from all of this.

290
00:18:48.895 --> 00:18:51.498
(upbeat music)

291
00:19:46.786 --> 00:19:47.620
- Well. hello.

292
00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:50.990
Wait. what was your name again?

293
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:52.292
(Brandon laughs)

294
00:19:52.292 --> 00:19:54.160
I'm just kidding.
Brandon Montgomery.

295
00:19:55.295 --> 00:19:56.729
- I was hoping
I'd see you again.

296
00:19:57.797 --> 00:19:59.098
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

297
00:19:59.098 --> 00:20:00.500
- Why?

298
00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:01.968
- Well. you see
it's just something

299
00:20:01.968 --> 00:20:04.704
that I didn't get from
you last time that we met.

300
00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:06.606
and I just can't get past it.

301
00:20:06.606 --> 00:20:08.107
- And you're still not
getting my last name.

302
00:20:08.107 --> 00:20:09.742
- (chuckles) You're funny.

303
00:20:09.742 --> 00:20:12.011
and it's not what
I'm talking about.

304
00:20:12.011 --> 00:20:14.180
I'm talking about
your phone number.

305
00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.516
- Huh. oh really?
- Mm-hmm.

306
00:20:16.516 --> 00:20:18.585
I was laying down at
night in the bed thinking.

307
00:20:18.585 --> 00:20:21.654
"Wow. what if I
never see her again?

308
00:20:21.654 --> 00:20:23.956
How do I get in
contact with her?"

309
00:20:23.956 --> 00:20:25.525
One of my biggest
mistakes was not getting

310
00:20:25.525 --> 00:20:26.426
your phone number.

311
00:20:27.394 --> 00:20:29.028
- Well. let's fix that.

312
00:20:29.028 --> 00:20:30.029
Give me your phone.

313
00:20:52.151 --> 00:20:52.985
There you go.

314
00:20:52.985 --> 00:20:54.020
Now there's no excuse.

315
00:20:56.188 --> 00:20:59.559
- Okay Lexi. no last name?

316
00:21:00.493 --> 00:21:01.794
- Cute.
- I can be.

317
00:21:03.229 --> 00:21:04.364
I'll be calling you.

318
00:21:04.364 --> 00:21:05.932
- Okay.

319
00:21:05.932 --> 00:21:09.669
Hey. do you think you can
help me out with something?

320
00:21:09.669 --> 00:21:11.270
I'm a little tight.

321
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.940
I just needed some
help stretching.

322
00:21:15.975 --> 00:21:17.410
- Off course. it'd
be my pleasure.

323
00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:18.811
- Well. thank you.

324
00:21:21.348 --> 00:21:24.517
(mellow guitar music)

325
00:21:27.687 --> 00:21:28.521
Pull harder.

326
00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:31.724
Yeah.

327
00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:35.962
- Feel good?
- Yeah.

328
00:21:35.962 --> 00:21:38.230
* Keeping me going
and till the morning *

329
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:40.032
* I could watch you leave

330
00:21:40.032 --> 00:21:41.434
* Then I could
put you to sleep *

331
00:21:41.434 --> 00:21:43.570
* And I'd watch you breath

332
00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:44.437
* Slow mama

333
00:21:44.437 --> 00:21:45.905
* My name is Cash

334
00:21:45.905 --> 00:21:49.141
* I just want you to
do a favor for me *

335
00:21:49.141 --> 00:21:50.209
* It's real simple

336
00:21:50.209 --> 00:21:51.711
* Just don't get up my nympho

337
00:21:51.711 --> 00:21:53.045
* I'm ready to lay you down

338
00:21:53.045 --> 00:21:55.748
* So can I get your info

339
00:21:55.748 --> 00:21:57.517
* So you cracked a smile

340
00:21:57.517 --> 00:21:59.519
* So you know I'm
not backing down *

341
00:21:59.519 --> 00:22:00.887
* Not now. nope.

342
00:22:00.887 --> 00:22:03.155
* Cash is this. Cash is that

343
00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:05.358
* So come on and
show Cash your cat *

344
00:22:05.358 --> 00:22:06.926
* Hope your ass is fat

345
00:22:06.926 --> 00:22:09.328
* I don't like tell a
problem I might bite you *

346
00:22:09.328 --> 00:22:12.399
* When I'm behind you
(groans) Pull it harder. *

347
00:22:12.399 --> 00:22:13.232
- Harder?

348
00:22:13.232 --> 00:22:16.436
- (groans) Yeah.

349
00:22:16.436 --> 00:22:18.304
- Oh. you can go
harder I can take it.

350
00:22:19.205 --> 00:22:22.341
* You got me feeling for you

351
00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:26.713
* I just can't
leave you for now *

352
00:22:26.713 --> 00:22:29.048
My legs are still
a little bit tight.

353
00:22:29.048 --> 00:22:31.083
- Let's work on that.

354
00:22:31.083 --> 00:22:33.019
* Damn babe. get on
your on you knees *

355
00:22:33.019 --> 00:22:34.554
* And bring your head to me

356
00:22:34.554 --> 00:22:36.155
* I wanna video tape you

357
00:22:36.155 --> 00:22:37.390

(phone chimes)

443
00:26:11.938 --> 00:26:12.939
- Hey babe.

444
00:26:12.939 --> 00:26:14.874
- What's up sweetheart.

445
00:26:20.546 --> 00:26:22.849
- So how was your run?

446
00:26:22.849 --> 00:26:24.416
- Ah. it was pretty good.

447
00:26:24.416 --> 00:26:25.317
but you're needed.

448
00:26:26.185 --> 00:26:28.721
- Yeah. I bet after finding out

449
00:26:28.721 --> 00:26:30.389
you have a long lost brother.

450
00:26:30.389 --> 00:26:31.991
I'm sure it's like extra stress.

451
00:26:31.991 --> 00:26:32.925
you know what I mean?

452
00:26:32.925 --> 00:26:35.461
- And surprisingly not really.

453
00:26:36.963 --> 00:26:39.699
You know I grew up always
wanting a brother or sister.

454
00:26:39.699 --> 00:26:43.502
and it's like 30 years
later dream come like.

455
00:26:45.738 --> 00:26:48.040
- Well. I can tell you
growing up with three brothers

456
00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:51.343
and two sisters. yeah.
it's no walk in a park.

457
00:26:51.343 --> 00:26:53.179
You always have to
share everything.

458
00:26:53.179 --> 00:26:54.847
and you never get any privacy.

459
00:26:54.847 --> 00:26:56.248
and then if one
person does something

460
00:26:56.248 --> 00:26:58.517
everybody gets blamed for it.

461
00:26:58.517 --> 00:27:00.586
Yeah. I'd rather
be an only child.

462
00:27:00.586 --> 00:27:03.222
- (chuckles) Well. I hear you.

463
00:27:03.222 --> 00:27:06.492
but I think it's all a matter
of perspective. you know?

464
00:27:06.492 --> 00:27:08.094
'Cause you gotta think about it.

465
00:27:08.094 --> 00:27:09.228
when I'm loosing my mom.

466
00:27:09.228 --> 00:27:10.663
and the way my father was.

467
00:27:10.663 --> 00:27:11.864
- Oh God baby. I'm sorry.

468
00:27:11.864 --> 00:27:13.565
I didn't mean to
be insensitive. or-

469
00:27:13.565 --> 00:27:15.201
- Oh no. baby no.

470
00:27:16.703 --> 00:27:19.538
I'm thankful to have
you and then my brother.

471
00:27:20.606 --> 00:27:21.540
(Alicia chuckles)

472
00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.643
(phone rings)

473
00:27:24.643 --> 00:27:25.845
Oh. speaking of.

00:27:28.915 --> 00:27:29.949

00:27:36.122 --> 00:27:36.989
- Nothing really.

477
00:27:36.989 --> 00:27:37.924
Why. what's up?

478
00:27:39.358 --> 00:27:40.592
- I wanted to see if you
wanted to come have dinner

479
00:27:40.592 --> 00:27:41.627

Well. babe. it looks like you

487
00:28:12.424 --> 00:28:14.093
with my brother and his wife.

488
00:28:14.093 --> 00:28:14.927
(Alicia chuckles)

489
00:28:14.927 --> 00:28:16.528
Double date.

490
00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:17.997
- Sounds good.

491
00:28:17.997 --> 00:28:20.566

wanna hop in that shower.

492
00:28:20.566 --> 00:28:21.901

00:28:21.901 --> 00:28:23.102

00:28:23.102 --> 00:28:24.270

498
00:28:35.347 --> 00:28:37.750
- Yeah. no I already

499
00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:39.585

547
00:30:52.851 --> 00:30:55.521
(door unlocks)

548
00:30:55.521 --> 00:30:57.623
- Hey. come on in.

549
00:30:57.623 --> 00:30:59.926
There he is.
- Yeah. how y'all doing?

00:30:59.926 --> 00:31:00.927

556
00:31:09.068 --> 00:31:10.336
(Alicia chuckles)

557
00:31:10.336 --> 00:31:14.240
Alicia. this is my
brother. Maurice.

558
00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:16.742
I've gotta really get
used to saying that.

559
00:31:16.742 --> 00:31:17.977
- Yeah. same here. bro.

560
00:31:19.078 --> 00:31:21.480
It's nice to meet you.
- Oh. same here.

561
00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.215
I swear in the last 24 hours.

562
00:31:23.215 --> 00:31:25.284
I've heard so much about you.

563
00:31:25.284 --> 00:31:27.686
Well. I mean. what
he knows so far.

564
00:31:27.686 --> 00:31:29.188
- Don't worry about it.

565
00:31:29.188 --> 00:31:31.257
We have plenty of time to
know more about each other.

566
00:31:31.257 --> 00:31:33.725
- Yeah. absolutely.

567
00:31:33.725 --> 00:31:36.595
(tense music)

568
00:31:36.595 --> 00:31:38.397
- Oh. here she is guys.

569
00:31:38.397 --> 00:31:41.133
(suspense music)

570
00:31:44.236 --> 00:31:45.104
My beautiful wife.

571
00:31:47.173 --> 00:31:50.009
- Oh. look at. Lexi.
- Alicia. great.

572
00:31:50.009 --> 00:31:50.977
(both giggling)

573
00:31:50.977 --> 00:31:52.811
Girl. what are you doing here?

574
00:31:52.811 --> 00:31:55.181
- Well. apparently your
man is my man's brother.

575
00:31:56.115 --> 00:32:00.319
- Oh wow. that is crazy.

576
00:32:00.319 --> 00:32:01.853
- I know. right?

577
00:32:01.853 --> 00:32:03.322
The first time I actually
get to meet your husband.

578
00:32:03.322 --> 00:32:06.458
it turns out he's the long
lost brother of my boyfriend.

579
00:32:06.458 --> 00:32:08.360
I mean. some small
world. isn't it?

580
00:32:09.361 --> 00:32:11.563
- Small world indeed.

581
00:32:11.563 --> 00:32:14.566
(suspenseful music)

582
00:32:17.003 --> 00:32:20.239
- [Marcus] So how do
you two know each other?

583
00:32:20.239 --> 00:32:22.608
- Okay. well Lexi and I used
to go to high school together.

584
00:32:22.608 --> 00:32:23.875
back in Buford.
- Yeah.

585
00:32:23.875 --> 00:32:26.812
- And by then you
went by Jennifer.

586
00:32:26.812 --> 00:32:28.414
and then now she goes by Lexi.

587
00:32:28.414 --> 00:32:30.416
- I told her I started
going by my middle name.

588
00:32:30.416 --> 00:32:33.552
- Oh. well we lost touch
after. you know. graduation.

589
00:32:33.552 --> 00:32:36.188
but we ran into each other in
Augusta Lake a few months ago.

590
00:32:36.188 --> 00:32:37.523
- Yeah. it was so crazy.

591
00:32:37.523 --> 00:32:38.991
We got a chance to catch on up.

592
00:32:38.991 --> 00:32:40.492
Told her I had gotten married.

593
00:32:40.492 --> 00:32:44.096
and I was looking forward to
her meeting my lovely husband.

594
00:32:44.096 --> 00:32:47.233
- Yeah. who I finally get to
meet tonight of all nights.

595
00:32:47.233 --> 00:32:50.169
I mean the same night that my
boyfriend here gets invited

596
00:32:50.169 --> 00:32:52.238
to dinner by his brother.

597
00:32:52.238 --> 00:32:56.075
- Wow. she's truly uncanny.
- Yes. it is.

598
00:32:56.075 --> 00:32:58.344
- I wonder what other
connections we all have?

599
00:32:58.344 --> 00:33:01.413
- Yeah. me too.

600
00:33:07.086 --> 00:33:10.022
- Yeah bro. which
way to the bathroom?

601
00:33:10.022 --> 00:33:13.125
- Oh. it's on down
the hall to the left.

602
00:33:13.125 --> 00:33:14.893
- Okay. thanks.

603
00:33:14.893 --> 00:33:16.495
I'll be right back.

604
00:33:22.734 --> 00:33:25.171
- Yeah. it's just
this whole universe.

605
00:33:25.171 --> 00:33:26.338
It's so crazy.

606
00:33:26.338 --> 00:33:28.274
like it was all
tripping off of this.

607
00:33:28.274 --> 00:33:29.641
- Yeah.
- Yeah. yeah.

608
00:33:29.641 --> 00:33:30.909
It's obviously destined

609
00:33:30.909 --> 00:33:32.611
that all of us being
together like this.

610
00:33:33.579 --> 00:33:35.214
it was meant to be.

611
00:33:35.214 --> 00:33:36.182
- I agree.

612
00:33:36.182 --> 00:33:37.116
and you know what?

613
00:33:37.116 --> 00:33:38.850
I think that calls for a toast.

614
00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.219
- Drinking before for dinner?

615
00:33:40.219 --> 00:33:41.320
- We're all grown. aren't we?

616
00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.254
(Maurice scoffs)

617
00:33:42.254 --> 00:33:43.955
Okay. let me go grab a bottle.

618
00:33:43.955 --> 00:33:45.557
and I can check on dinner
while I'm in there. okay?

619
00:33:45.557 --> 00:33:46.392
- Okay.

620
00:33:57.836 --> 00:34:01.607
So what is it that
you do for a living?

621
00:34:01.607 --> 00:34:03.309
- Oh. I just manage
a call center.

622
00:34:03.309 --> 00:34:06.011
- Oh. interesting.

623
00:34:06.011 --> 00:34:07.479
- No. it's not.

624
00:34:07.479 --> 00:34:09.348
- Yeah. (chuckles)

625
00:34:09.348 --> 00:34:11.383
- Now. well. what do you do?

626
00:34:11.383 --> 00:34:14.120
- You know. I dabbled a
bit in investment banking.

627
00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:16.455
- Oh my God. really. that's
actually interesting.

628
00:34:16.455 --> 00:34:17.989
like I've always been
interested in stocks.

629
00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:19.024
and bonds. and trading.

630
00:34:19.024 --> 00:34:20.226
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

631
00:34:20.226 --> 00:34:21.760
- Well. if you're
interested I'd be glad

632
00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:24.363
to show you and you know.
Brandon how it all works.

633
00:34:24.363 --> 00:34:26.198
- Oh. that'd be great.

634
00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.403
(fridge door opens)

635
00:34:33.572 --> 00:34:36.308
- So what's up with that.

636
00:34:36.308 --> 00:34:39.511
"Oh. my name is
Davenport bullshit?"

637
00:34:39.511 --> 00:34:41.147
- It was my mother's
maiden name.

638
00:34:41.147 --> 00:34:43.515
I like to use it
from time to time.

639
00:34:43.515 --> 00:34:45.016
- Hmm.

640
00:34:45.016 --> 00:34:47.686
So when were you gonna tell
me that you were married?

641
00:34:47.686 --> 00:34:49.188
When you were done fucking me?

642
00:34:51.022 --> 00:34:53.292
- And when were you gonna
tell me you had a girl?

643
00:34:53.292 --> 00:34:58.297
And I'm pretty sure you were
the one that was fucking me.

644
00:34:59.165 --> 00:35:00.332
- Look girls. that's my brother.

645
00:35:00.332 --> 00:35:01.933
- And that's my best friend.

646
00:35:01.933 --> 00:35:03.369
- I will end things with her.

647
00:35:03.369 --> 00:35:04.470
- Why would you do that?

648
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:05.671
- Why not?

649
00:35:05.671 --> 00:35:07.739
- Listen. I wouldn't
ask you to do something

650
00:35:07.739 --> 00:35:09.675
that I'm not willing to do.

651
00:35:09.675 --> 00:35:11.543
I'm not leaving my
husband right now.

652
00:35:12.711 --> 00:35:14.880
- Look. we got this
connection. okay.

653
00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.548
I wanna be with you.

654
00:35:17.916 --> 00:35:19.017
- I feel the same way.

655
00:35:22.188 --> 00:35:24.390
- Look. let's meet
up tonight. okay.

656
00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:25.524
I'm gonna drop Alicia off.

657
00:35:25.524 --> 00:35:28.126
and I'm gonna get us a room.

658
00:35:28.126 --> 00:35:30.128
- Are you sure?

659
00:35:30.128 --> 00:35:31.997
- Okay. ever since we
made that connection.

660
00:35:31.997 --> 00:35:33.299
I've never been more sure.

661
00:35:44.109 --> 00:35:45.944
- Everything okay over here?

662
00:35:45.944 --> 00:35:48.580
- Yes. perfect.

663
00:35:50.849 --> 00:35:53.419
- Oh yeah. I was
leaving the bathroom.

664
00:35:53.419 --> 00:35:55.321
and it was smelling
so good in here.

665
00:35:55.321 --> 00:35:57.323
I wanted to you know. come
and see what was baking

666
00:35:57.323 --> 00:35:58.990
in that oven in person.

667
00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:01.427
- Oh. thanks. (chuckles)

668
00:36:01.427 --> 00:36:04.330
- Yeah. my baby know what

669
00:36:05.264 --> 00:36:06.532
- Yeah. I see.

670
00:36:08.099 --> 00:36:10.035
- Babe. why don't you
take the bottle in.

671
00:36:10.035 --> 00:36:11.303
and I'll bring the glass. okay?

672
00:36:11.303 --> 00:36:12.137
- Cool.

673
00:36:13.639 --> 00:36:14.973
- I'll be right there.

674
00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:22.180

676
00:37:49.935 --> 00:37:50.869
- You're heading out?

677
00:37:50.869 --> 00:37:52.137
- Yeah. I'll be gone not long.

678
00:37:52.137 --> 00:37:53.772

my way over to you *

713
00:39:59.698 --> 00:40:02.534
* What's the deal

714
00:40:13.178 --> 00:40:14.513
- Everything good?

715
00:40:16.014 --> 00:40:18.484
- Yeah. perfect.

716
00:40:24.322 --> 00:40:25.123
- Good night.

717
00:40:26.124 --> 00:40:27.626
- Good night baby.

718
00:40:30.295 --> 00:40:32.898
(violin music)

719
00:40:46.311 --> 00:40:48.780
(egg sizzles)

720
00:41:05.764 --> 00:41:08.500
- Good morning. babe.
- Morning.

721
00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:10.201
How did you sleep?

722
00:41:10.201 --> 00:41:11.570
- I slept good.

723
00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:13.038
How about yourself?

724
00:41:13.038 --> 00:41:13.872
- Like a baby.

725
00:41:15.941 --> 00:41:18.376
- I took a glimpse
at you last night.

726
00:41:18.376 --> 00:41:19.645
You were so peaceful.

727
00:41:21.847 --> 00:41:24.583
- I am at peace
about everything.

728
00:41:25.584 --> 00:41:27.252
- Glad to hear that.

729
00:41:29.287 --> 00:41:31.790
- So what are you up to today?

730
00:41:33.725 --> 00:41:35.426
- Probably a little bit of work.

731
00:41:35.426 --> 00:41:36.928
I'll hala at Brandon later.

732
00:41:36.928 --> 00:41:38.630
- Okay.

733
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:40.231
- Yeah.

734
00:41:40.231 --> 00:41:41.032
You?

735
00:41:42.433 --> 00:41:46.171
- Well. more of it's like bored.

736
00:41:47.606 --> 00:41:50.441
Let me finish up your egg and
bring up your plate. okay.

737
00:41:50.441 --> 00:41:51.577
- Thanks babe.

738
00:42:15.834 --> 00:42:17.703
- Hey babe. it's me.

739
00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:24.442

740
00:42:29.948 --> 00:42:30.782

741
00:42:38.523 --> 00:42:41.693
(door unlocks)

742
00:42:41.693 --> 00:42:42.560
Hi.

743
00:42:43.561 --> 00:42:45.764

00:42:45.764 --> 00:42:47.065
Whatchu doing here?

745
00:42:47.065 --> 00:42:48.767
- I just came by to.

746
00:42:48.767 --> 00:42:52.037
before work and make
sure everything's good.

747
00:42:52.037 --> 00:42:54.405
- Hmm. yeah. yeah.
I appreciate that.

748
00:42:56.842 --> 00:42:58.944
So how was the
rest of your night?

749
00:42:58.944 --> 00:43:00.445
- I mean. it was okay.

750
00:43:00.445 --> 00:43:02.113
Could have been better if
you know. somebody came over

751
00:43:02.113 --> 00:43:03.649
and cuddled with me.

752
00:43:03.649 --> 00:43:04.883
- Yeah.

753
00:43:04.883 --> 00:43:06.251
Yeah again. I'm
sorry about that.

754
00:43:06.251 --> 00:43:08.353
I'm sorry if I had you worried.

755
00:43:08.353 --> 00:43:09.921
I actually fell
asleep on the couch.

756
00:43:09.921 --> 00:43:13.358
reading a book and
my phone was in here.

757
00:43:15.827 --> 00:43:17.629
- You know. speaking
of last night.

758
00:43:18.730 --> 00:43:20.465
what do you think about.
you know. Maurice?

759
00:43:20.465 --> 00:43:22.734
I think he's really.
really nice. you know?

760
00:43:22.734 --> 00:43:25.570
Oh. he knows a lot about
investments and trading.

761
00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:28.173
and hey. maybe that's
something we should look into.

762
00:43:30.876 --> 00:43:32.343
- We?

763
00:43:32.343 --> 00:43:35.280
- Yeah. I mean. we are
planning to spend the rest

764
00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:36.815
of our lives together.

765
00:43:36.815 --> 00:43:41.019
so we should start posing
that generational wealth.

766
00:43:41.019 --> 00:43:44.422
- Yeah. yeah. yeah. of course.

767
00:43:44.422 --> 00:43:46.725
- Yeah. and Lexi. I mean.
I think she's really nice.

768
00:43:46.725 --> 00:43:48.159
What do you think about her?

769
00:43:48.159 --> 00:43:49.728
- What about her?

770
00:43:49.728 --> 00:43:53.131
- I mean last night was the
first night you met. right?

771
00:43:53.131 --> 00:43:55.834
- Yeah.
- So what do you think?

772
00:43:55.834 --> 00:43:58.837
Do you think she's
got a good vibe?

773
00:43:58.837 --> 00:44:00.105
You think she's smart?

774
00:44:00.105 --> 00:44:01.372
You think she's pretty?

775
00:44:01.372 --> 00:44:03.041
- Whoa. whoa. whoa.
whoa. whoa. I mean.

776
00:44:03.041 --> 00:44:05.777
where are all of
this coming from?

777
00:44:05.777 --> 00:44:07.913
- I was just asking
you a question.

778
00:44:07.913 --> 00:44:09.214
- Okay. well. it kinda
sounds like you're giving me

779
00:44:09.214 --> 00:44:10.481
the third degree.

780
00:44:10.481 --> 00:44:13.251
- No. look. I know we're
gonna be spending a lot

781
00:44:13.251 --> 00:44:14.485
of time with Maurice and Lexi.

782
00:44:14.485 --> 00:44:17.322
I just wanna make sure
that everything is good.

783
00:44:17.322 --> 00:44:18.389
that we have a good vibe.

784
00:44:18.389 --> 00:44:20.692
that it's good.

785
00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:25.363
- Yeah. mm-hmm. sure.

786
00:44:25.363 --> 00:44:27.933
(phone chimes)

787
00:44:34.773 --> 00:44:38.409
Speaking of Maurice
probably wanna get up later.

788
00:44:38.409 --> 00:44:39.778
- Oh cool.

789
00:44:42.047 --> 00:44:43.248
- Yeah. I forgot.

790
00:44:43.248 --> 00:44:44.315
I need to finish
up in the bathroom.

791
00:44:44.315 --> 00:44:45.683
so I'll see you later.

792
00:44:45.683 --> 00:44:47.185
have a good day.

793
00:44:47.185 --> 00:44:48.619
- Yeah. you too.

794
00:44:51.656 --> 00:44:54.159
(door closes)

795
00:44:57.929 --> 00:44:58.730
Bye.

796
00:45:06.171 --> 00:45:09.107
(Brandon chuckles)

797
00:45:12.177 --> 00:45:15.480
(phone chimes)

798
00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:16.314
- Okay.

799
00:45:17.382 --> 00:45:19.951

Jenkins.

835
00:46:37.662 --> 00:46:38.496
Johnston.

836
00:46:42.267 --> 00:46:44.402
Jennifer Johnston.

837
00:46:49.407 --> 00:46:50.241
Damn.

838
00:46:53.111 --> 00:46:55.313
Oh. hey Tracey. can
you come here a second?

839
00:46:57.282 --> 00:46:58.116
- What's up?

840
00:46:59.084 --> 00:47:01.619
- Hey. I have a question.

841
00:47:01.619 --> 00:47:03.855
Would you be
suspicious of someone

842
00:47:03.855 --> 00:47:06.157
if they didn't have any
social media presence?

843
00:47:08.894 --> 00:47:11.162
- I mean. not necessarily.

844
00:47:12.363 --> 00:47:13.899
- Really?

845
00:47:13.899 --> 00:47:16.567
Girl. in this day
and age everybody has

846
00:47:16.567 --> 00:47:17.936
like some form of social media.

847
00:47:17.936 --> 00:47:19.871
like heck. some of
the jobs require it.

848
00:47:20.972 --> 00:47:22.373
- What's your point. Alicia?

849
00:47:23.241 --> 00:47:24.609
- Okay. so look.

850
00:47:24.609 --> 00:47:26.544
so I've been you know.
catching up with his old friend

851
00:47:26.544 --> 00:47:27.578
from high school.

852
00:47:27.578 --> 00:47:28.813
and it turns out

853
00:47:28.813 --> 00:47:33.051
that her husband is my
man's long lost brother.

854
00:47:34.319 --> 00:47:35.586
- Talk about coincidence.

855
00:47:35.586 --> 00:47:37.422
- Right. that's what
I thought at first.

856
00:47:37.422 --> 00:47:39.357
but then I don't know.

857
00:47:39.357 --> 00:47:40.892
There's something weird.

858
00:47:40.892 --> 00:47:43.294
like some kind of vibe going
on between her and Brandon.

859
00:47:43.294 --> 00:47:46.297
and like. I'm just trying
to do my due diligence.

860
00:47:46.297 --> 00:47:47.532
and she's not on Facebook.

861
00:47:47.532 --> 00:47:49.367
She's not on Twitter.
or Instagram.

862
00:47:49.367 --> 00:47:51.102
or in Snapchat.

863
00:47:51.102 --> 00:47:53.104
like she aint even got TikTok.

864
00:47:54.572 --> 00:47:56.841
- I mean. some people just
don't like their personal

865
00:47:56.841 --> 00:47:58.876
information out there like that.

866
00:47:58.876 --> 00:48:00.611
- Yeah. but usually
those people are trying

867
00:48:00.611 --> 00:48:01.746
to hide something.

868
00:48:03.915 --> 00:48:06.417
- Okay. it's like they say.

869
00:48:06.417 --> 00:48:08.319
if you go search
off for something.

870
00:48:08.319 --> 00:48:09.687
you may find something.

871
00:48:09.687 --> 00:48:11.622
and you might not
like what you find.

872
00:48:12.857 --> 00:48:17.862
My advice. if it doesn't
impact you personally

873
00:48:18.596 --> 00:48:18.964
just leave it alone.

874
00:48:20.465 --> 00:48:21.933
- Yeah. but I think it might.

875
00:48:24.869 --> 00:48:28.406
- Well. be careful girl.

876
00:48:28.406 --> 00:48:30.008
- (chuckles) Oh. thanks.

877
00:48:30.008 --> 00:48:31.109
- You're welcome.

878
00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:32.978
- You are so helpful.
- I know it.

879
00:48:32.978 --> 00:48:35.646
(Alicia laughs)

880
00:48:41.252 --> 00:48:43.989
(Maurice knocks)

881
00:48:56.134 --> 00:48:58.636
- What's good?
- Not much. bro.

882
00:49:00.538 --> 00:49:01.572
What's good with you?

883
00:49:07.745 --> 00:49:10.481
Yeah man. so what's
good with you?

884
00:49:11.916 --> 00:49:14.785
- The question is. what's
good for the both of us?

885
00:49:14.785 --> 00:49:15.953
- Hm?

886
00:49:15.953 --> 00:49:17.255
I don't follow.

887
00:49:18.456 --> 00:49:22.260
- Well. Alicia told me
that you're interested

888
00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:23.694
in some investment baking.

889
00:49:24.862 --> 00:49:26.731
- I mean. it's some
shit I dabble in.

890
00:49:26.731 --> 00:49:27.565
What's up?

891
00:49:28.733 --> 00:49:30.435
- Okay well. I've been looking

892
00:49:30.435 --> 00:49:33.104
to invest the money
into something.

893
00:49:33.104 --> 00:49:34.705
so I think we should chop it up.

894
00:49:35.706 --> 00:49:36.541
- Are you sure?

895
00:49:37.908 --> 00:49:39.710
I mean. we're just getting
to know each other.

896
00:49:41.179 --> 00:49:45.516
- Listen. what I know is that
you're my brother. all right?

897
00:49:45.516 --> 00:49:46.784
- And what better
person to trust

898
00:49:46.784 --> 00:49:48.819
with my money than my own blood.

899
00:49:48.819 --> 00:49:50.288
- True.

900
00:49:50.288 --> 00:49:52.523
Man. I just found you.

901
00:49:52.523 --> 00:49:54.225
I mean. I don't want nothing.

902
00:49:54.225 --> 00:49:56.361
or no one to come in between us.

903
00:49:57.862 --> 00:49:59.597
- It won't. trust me.

904
00:50:04.769 --> 00:50:07.972
- You were quite the achiever
back in the day I see.

905
00:50:07.972 --> 00:50:11.176
- Hmm. yeah.

906
00:50:11.176 --> 00:50:12.977
Yeah. I guess you
could say that.

907
00:50:14.912 --> 00:50:16.781
I used to work extra hard to try

908
00:50:16.781 --> 00:50:19.984
and get our father's attention.

909
00:50:21.352 --> 00:50:22.553
Hoping to impress him.

910
00:50:24.289 --> 00:50:26.124
make him proud.

911
00:50:26.124 --> 00:50:27.925
to make him actually
wanna spend some time

912
00:50:27.925 --> 00:50:28.826
with me. you know?

913
00:50:32.363 --> 00:50:34.031
- I bet the girls didn't
mind spending the time

914
00:50:34.031 --> 00:50:35.466
with you though. huh?

915
00:50:35.466 --> 00:50:37.902
- Let's just say
that when it came

916
00:50:37.902 --> 00:50:42.173
to being an overachiever
it definitely didn't hurt

917
00:50:42.173 --> 00:50:43.774
when it came to
getting the girls.

918
00:50:43.774 --> 00:50:45.009
I think you know what I mean?

919
00:50:45.009 --> 00:50:46.644
- (chuckles) I feel you.

920
00:50:48.613 --> 00:50:51.282
Lexi. really enjoy having
you guys over last night.

921
00:50:52.683 --> 00:50:55.520
She out going on and on about
how good a time she had.

922
00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:59.190
and how she enjoyed you guys'
company. especially yours.

923
00:51:00.625 --> 00:51:02.827
- Well. I definitely enjoy
getting to know her too.

924
00:51:04.729 --> 00:51:06.964
You know this whole situation.

925
00:51:06.964 --> 00:51:08.065
and I not only got a brother.

926
00:51:08.065 --> 00:51:09.700
but a sister too.

927
00:51:11.302 --> 00:51:14.439
- Yeah. a sister.
- Mm-hmm.

928
00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:18.476
- She really took a
liking to you though.

929
00:51:18.476 --> 00:51:19.677
You know it's funny

930
00:51:19.677 --> 00:51:21.179
because Lexi really
has a hard time

931
00:51:21.179 --> 00:51:22.247
letting anybody in.

932
00:51:23.914 --> 00:51:27.752
- Well. I guess I just
have a way with people.

933
00:51:30.321 --> 00:51:31.156
- I see.

934
00:51:33.658 --> 00:51:36.161
(phone rings)

935
00:51:41.532 --> 00:51:42.833
- I need to take this.

936
00:51:42.833 --> 00:51:44.369
- Oh. do your thing.

937
00:51:45.636 --> 00:51:46.437
- Hello.

938
00:51:52.343 --> 00:51:53.178
I'm doing good.

939
00:51:53.178 --> 00:51:55.813
How about yourself?

940
00:51:55.813 --> 00:51:57.348
Awesome.

941
00:51:57.348 --> 00:52:00.385
So did you handle what I
asked you to take care of?

942
00:52:01.919 --> 00:52:02.753
Okay.

943
00:52:04.189 --> 00:52:04.989
All right.

944
00:52:05.923 --> 00:52:06.757
Perfect.

945
00:52:08.826 --> 00:52:09.860
Okay.

946
00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:12.863
(suspenseful music)

947
00:52:18.603 --> 00:52:20.271
All right. I really
appreciate it then.

948
00:52:22.173 --> 00:52:23.308
I'll talk to you later.

949
00:52:24.409 --> 00:52:25.610
All right. thanks again.

950
00:52:28.346 --> 00:52:29.947
Sorry about that.

951
00:52:29.947 --> 00:52:32.016
I had to make sure
that something was
getting taken care of.

952
00:52:34.685 --> 00:52:35.520
- That's cool.

953
00:52:36.987 --> 00:52:38.122
What's this?

954
00:52:40.758 --> 00:52:44.395
- Oh. that's just a rock
that I found in Costa Rico

955
00:52:44.395 --> 00:52:45.830
while I was hiking.

956
00:52:45.830 --> 00:52:47.031
I kept it as a souvenir.

957
00:52:48.366 --> 00:52:49.267
- Nice.

958
00:52:55.506 --> 00:52:58.643
- So don't you wanna know
what that was all about?

959
00:52:59.844 --> 00:53:01.912
- Not really. I mean.
it's your business.

960
00:53:01.912 --> 00:53:06.217
- Well. actually it
was our business.

961
00:53:07.184 --> 00:53:08.786
- I don't follow.

962
00:53:08.786 --> 00:53:09.787
- Mm-hmm.

963
00:53:12.623 --> 00:53:17.628
I set up a bank account for
you with half of the money

964
00:53:18.496 --> 00:53:19.497
from our father's company.

965
00:53:20.665 --> 00:53:23.334
- Brandon. man. you
ain't got to do that.

966
00:53:23.334 --> 00:53:24.168
- I know.

967
00:53:24.168 --> 00:53:25.169
I wanted to.

968
00:53:27.104 --> 00:53:29.173
- I don't know what to say.

969
00:53:29.173 --> 00:53:30.007
- You don't have
the say anything.

970
00:53:30.007 --> 00:53:31.242
- Wow!

971
00:53:31.242 --> 00:53:35.846
- I mean. it was our
father's company.

972
00:53:36.981 --> 00:53:38.015
so half of that money
was yours anyway.

973
00:53:38.015 --> 00:53:41.419
besides what's mine is yours.

974
00:53:41.419 --> 00:53:43.488
and what's yours is mine. right?

975
00:53:46.257 --> 00:53:47.091

976
00:53:54.332 --> 00:53:56.934

977
00:54:12.149 --> 00:54:14.184

* Fucking all our

1100
00:59:45.683 --> 00:59:47.117

00:59:47.117 --> 00:59:48.886

1102
00:59:48.886 --> 00:59:50.655

1109
01:00:00.464 --> 01:00:03.200
* I don't wanna fight

1110
01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:04.769
* As soon as you wake up

1111
01:00:04.769 --> 01:00:06.203
* Baby let's make up

1115
01:00:10.474 --> 01:00:12.009

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:22.219
* As soon as you wake up

1122
01:00:22.219 --> 01:00:23.620
* Baby let's just make up

1123
01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:26.223
(upbeat music)

1124
01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:27.284
- Alicia?

1125
01:01:28.285 --> 01:01:29.453
Hi.
- Hi Maurice.

1126
01:01:29.453 --> 01:01:30.587
- What's good?

1127
01:01:30.587 --> 01:01:32.522
Absolutely. come on in.
- Oh. thank you.

1128
01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:35.259
Sorry to drop by
on you like this.

1129
01:01:35.259 --> 01:01:36.827
but is Lexi home?

1130
01:01:37.661 --> 01:01:38.495
- No.

1131
01:01:39.964 --> 01:01:41.198
Why. what's up?

1132
01:01:42.499 --> 01:01:45.469
- I just. all right. I
know this is gonna sound

1133
01:01:45.469 --> 01:01:46.703
like bullshit and.

1134
01:01:47.671 --> 01:01:48.906
you know when I say it out loud.

1135
01:01:48.906 --> 01:01:50.340
it does sound a little crazy.

1136
01:01:51.909 --> 01:01:54.344
- Alicia. what's
going on with you?

1137
01:01:55.512 --> 01:01:57.848
- Okay. so it's not
what's going on with me.

1138
01:01:59.316 --> 01:02:02.286
It's what's going on with
your wife and my boyfriend.

1139
01:02:02.286 --> 01:02:03.120
- Huh?

1140
01:02:04.288 --> 01:02:05.689
- Don't you think
something's going on

1141
01:02:05.689 --> 01:02:07.792
between Brandon and Lexi?

1142
01:02:07.792 --> 01:02:08.592
- What?

1143
01:02:10.027 --> 01:02:12.229
- I mean just every
time they get together.

1144
01:02:12.229 --> 01:02:13.697
I get this weird vibe.

1145
01:02:15.132 --> 01:02:17.401
and my instincts are telling
me that something's wrong.

1146
01:02:17.401 --> 01:02:18.668
- Okay. look. look. look.

1147
01:02:20.104 --> 01:02:23.841
Alicia. I know we've known
each other for a short time.

1148
01:02:23.841 --> 01:02:26.510
but trust me when I tell
you there's nothing going

1149
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:29.013
on between Lexi and Brandon.

1150
01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:31.681
He really loves you.

1151
01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:33.984
He'll never do anything
like that to hurt you.

1152
01:02:35.519 --> 01:02:39.656
Besides she knows that
she does that to me again.

1153
01:02:41.025 --> 01:02:42.492
I leave her for good.

1154
01:02:42.492 --> 01:02:45.863
- Wait. does what again?
- If she cheats.

1155
01:02:50.334 --> 01:02:51.969
She stepped on our
marriage before.

1156
01:02:51.969 --> 01:02:54.304
but it was a long time ago.

1157
01:02:54.304 --> 01:02:56.306
and she promised you and
they will do it again.

1158
01:02:59.443 --> 01:03:01.645
Plus the way your
Brandon looks at you.

1159
01:03:01.645 --> 01:03:03.013
the way he talks about you.

1160
01:03:04.581 --> 01:03:07.784
I can tell he had
never do anything to
hurt or betrayed you.

1161
01:03:09.119 --> 01:03:10.787
So you gotta trust
me when I tell you

1162
01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:14.391
there is nothing going on
between Brandon and Lexi.

1163
01:03:14.391 --> 01:03:17.294
there's nothing going on. okay?

1164
01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:20.430
And if it makes you
feel any better.

1165
01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:24.401
I can keep a close eye
on him for you. okay?

1166
01:03:24.401 --> 01:03:25.235
- Thanks.

1167
01:03:26.103 --> 01:03:26.937
- Cool.

1168
01:03:28.038 --> 01:03:30.107
Oh. I don't know if you knew.

1169
01:03:30.107 --> 01:03:33.110
but today my birthday.

1170
01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:34.678
- Oh my gosh. I'm sorry.

1171
01:03:34.678 --> 01:03:36.513
Happy birthday. (chuckles)
- Thank you.

1172
01:03:36.513 --> 01:03:37.982
Thank you.

1173
01:03:37.982 --> 01:03:39.349
- Oh God. and I came here
today with all this bullshit.

1174
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:40.450
I'm sorry.
- No. no. no. it's cool.

1175
01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:41.718
it's cool.

1176
01:03:41.718 --> 01:03:43.187
You're gonna make it up to me.

1177
01:03:45.189 --> 01:03:46.656
- I want you and
Brandon. you know.

1178
01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:49.960
come by and have
dinner with us tonight.

1179
01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:50.794
- Okay.

1180
01:03:51.929 --> 01:03:54.498
(upbeat music)

1181
01:04:04.341 --> 01:04:06.010
- That is something.

1182
01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:09.513
- That was what?

1183
01:04:10.547 --> 01:04:13.483
Beautiful. amazing. tantalizing?

1184
01:04:15.219 --> 01:04:16.686
- You're feeling yourself up.

1185
01:04:17.587 --> 01:04:19.356
- Well. that was filling you

1186
01:04:19.356 --> 01:04:21.058
which you already
know it is good.

1187
01:04:22.659 --> 01:04:24.094
- No. but it's sexy.

1188
01:04:27.097 --> 01:04:30.968
Being with you is
everything I wanted.

1189
01:04:31.902 --> 01:04:33.137
Everything I needed.

1190
01:04:35.005 --> 01:04:37.908
Who would have thought
that when we met

1191
01:04:37.908 --> 01:04:39.944
a few weeks ago at the park.

1192
01:04:39.944 --> 01:04:40.844
(Brandon chuckles)

1193
01:04:40.844 --> 01:04:42.646
that we would be here.

1194
01:04:42.646 --> 01:04:43.480
I know.

1195
01:04:44.781 --> 01:04:45.950
- You know what?

1196
01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:47.017
I did.
- Okay.

1197
01:04:47.851 --> 01:04:49.219
- When I first saw you.

1198
01:04:49.219 --> 01:04:50.854
I knew we belong together.

1199
01:04:52.289 --> 01:04:57.127
Listen. nothing or nobody
in this world can change

1200
01:04:57.995 --> 01:05:00.030
the way I feel about you. Lexi.

1201
01:05:00.030 --> 01:05:00.797
I love you.

1202
01:05:06.937 --> 01:05:07.771
- I love you too.

1203
01:05:09.173 --> 01:05:11.408
and I wanna spend the
rest of my life with you.

1204
01:05:15.845 --> 01:05:19.984
- Words from your beautiful
lips to God's glorious ears.

1205
01:05:21.618 --> 01:05:26.623
- Well. so my problem.
Maurice and Alisha.

1206
01:05:31.895 --> 01:05:33.297
- That's my brother.

1207
01:05:33.297 --> 01:05:34.965
- And that's my best friend.

1208
01:05:36.433 --> 01:05:38.602
- Well. let's not even worry
about them right now. okay?

1209
01:05:38.602 --> 01:05:41.071
Let's just focus on being

1210
01:05:41.071 --> 01:05:43.807
in the moment right
here right now.

1211
01:05:43.807 --> 01:05:45.042
because this...

1212
01:05:47.877 --> 01:05:51.148
this is paradise.

1213
01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:58.455
(phone rings)

1214
01:06:04.761 --> 01:06:05.595
- Hello?

1215
01:06:08.565 --> 01:06:09.899
Yeah.

1216
01:06:09.899 --> 01:06:11.701
Yeah. I'll be home
in a few minutes.

1217
01:06:13.837 --> 01:06:15.105
Yeah. see you then.

1218
01:06:15.105 --> 01:06:16.273
Okay.

1219
01:06:16.273 --> 01:06:17.174
Love you too.

1220
01:06:19.376 --> 01:06:20.210
Bye.

1221
01:06:23.313 --> 01:06:24.648
- So much of paradise.

1222
01:06:26.783 --> 01:06:29.619
- Yeah. paradise.

1223
01:06:34.758 --> 01:06:39.529
Hey. I want to do
something for you. for us.

1224
01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:42.732
- We both know that what I want.

1225
01:06:42.732 --> 01:06:44.068
we can't have right now.

1226
01:06:46.336 --> 01:06:50.474
- But what if I told you I
already started the process?

1227
01:06:51.975 --> 01:06:53.477
- Brandon. what are you up to?

1228
01:06:54.944 --> 01:06:59.516
- Okay. so I started an off
shore account in your name.

1229
01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:04.821
- Brandon. look. I want
you not your money.

1230
01:07:04.821 --> 01:07:07.691
- Oh. I know. I know.
and I want you too.

1231
01:07:08.858 --> 01:07:11.528
Let's just say that
it's a symbol for

1232
01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:16.600
how much I wanna be with you.

1233
01:07:17.767 --> 01:07:20.737
How much I wanna
take care of you.

1234
01:07:20.737 --> 01:07:22.772
and how much I love you.

1235
01:07:25.309 --> 01:07:26.876
- You really love me?

1236
01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:28.545
- With all my heart.

1237
01:07:30.147 --> 01:07:31.681
- I love you too.

1238
01:07:31.681 --> 01:07:34.684
(suspenseful music)

1239
01:09:19.556 --> 01:09:21.625
Hey babe.
- Hey. what's up wifey?

1240
01:09:21.625 --> 01:09:22.859
- Hi.

1241
01:09:22.859 --> 01:09:24.628
How's your day?
- It's been good.

1242
01:09:24.628 --> 01:09:26.830
Actually I got some
things situated for us.

1243
01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:27.964
- Good.
- Yeah.

1244
01:09:28.798 --> 01:09:30.567
Where have you been?

1245
01:09:30.567 --> 01:09:34.471
Just out running some positives.

1246
01:09:35.872 --> 01:09:40.377
- Oh. I invited Brandon and
Alicia over for dinner tonight.

1247
01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:42.879
Is that all right?

1248
01:09:42.879 --> 01:09:45.382
- Hey. whatever the
birthday boy wants.

1249
01:09:45.382 --> 01:09:49.018
the birthday boy gets.
- Oh. I'm the birthday man.

1250
01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:50.487
Birthday man.

1251
01:09:50.487 --> 01:09:51.421
(both chuckling)

1252
01:09:51.421 --> 01:09:53.890
- I got it baby. birthday man.

1253
01:09:53.890 --> 01:09:55.359
I'm gonna go see
my shower. okay?

1254
01:09:55.359 --> 01:09:56.893
- All right. cool.

1255
01:09:56.893 --> 01:09:58.595
Damn. I shoulda
waited for you to go.

1256
01:09:58.595 --> 01:10:00.464
- I got you next
time. birthday man.

1257
01:10:02.031 --> 01:10:04.200
- All right. I'll
hold you to that.

1258
01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.770
(Lexi chuckles)

1259
01:10:06.770 --> 01:10:08.772
I love you.
- Love you too.

1260
01:10:12.642 --> 01:10:15.645
(suspenseful music)

1261
01:10:24.488 --> 01:10:27.190
- Brandon. we need to talk.

1262
01:10:29.859 --> 01:10:32.262
- Yeah. you're right.

1263
01:10:36.065 --> 01:10:37.634
I need to tell you something.

1264
01:10:38.702 --> 01:10:41.671
(suspenseful music)

1265
01:10:50.747 --> 01:10:52.516
(doorbell dings)

1266
01:10:52.516 --> 01:10:53.817
- [Maurice] I got it.

1267
01:10:53.817 --> 01:10:55.552
- Okay. I'm coming.

1268
01:10:55.552 --> 01:10:59.356
(suspenseful music continues)

1269
01:11:04.594 --> 01:11:05.862
- Feeling chilly?

1270
01:11:05.862 --> 01:11:08.465
I'm gonna warm you baby.
- Dawg. yo ate already?

1271
01:11:08.465 --> 01:11:09.866
Y'all hungry?
- Damn. we hungry.

1272
01:11:09.866 --> 01:11:10.767
- Hey guys.

1273
01:11:12.569 --> 01:11:13.737
- Lexi.

1274
01:11:16.973 --> 01:11:17.807
- Hello. Lexi.

1275
01:11:21.711 --> 01:11:24.180
- What is that on your finger?

1276
01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:26.149
- Oh. that is just
my engagement ring.

1277
01:11:26.149 --> 01:11:28.885
my man got me before
we left the house.

1278
01:11:28.885 --> 01:11:32.121
You know. Brandon
asked me to marry him.

1279
01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:33.022
- Seriously?

1280
01:11:35.359 --> 01:11:36.826
- Yeah bro. I'm sorry.

1281
01:11:36.826 --> 01:11:37.994
I didn't mean to steal
your thunder on your day.

1282
01:11:37.994 --> 01:11:40.330
- Oh. no bro. I ain't trippin'.

1283
01:11:40.330 --> 01:11:42.799
What better way to
celebrate my birthday

1284
01:11:42.799 --> 01:11:44.300
than celebrating love.

1285
01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:46.603
Bringing two people
together in Holy matrimony.

1286
01:11:48.171 --> 01:11:50.707
- Yeah. when love hits.

1287
01:11:50.707 --> 01:11:51.975
you just gotta go with it.

1288
01:11:58.114 --> 01:11:59.182
This is great. right?

1289
01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:02.185
- Yeah. it's awesome.

1290
01:12:02.185 --> 01:12:03.653
I'm gonna go check on dinner.

1291
01:12:08.592 --> 01:12:09.726
- Let me see that rock.

1292
01:12:10.627 --> 01:12:11.861
Oh wait.

1293
01:12:12.696 --> 01:12:14.698
Yo. this shit is dope.

1294
01:12:14.698 --> 01:12:16.232
- And you're right my
man was just saying.

1295
01:12:16.232 --> 01:12:17.934
- Yeah. yeah. he did his thing.

1296
01:12:19.235 --> 01:12:21.204
- Hey. I'm gonna
go and help Lexi.

1297
01:12:21.204 --> 01:12:22.038
- Okay baby.

1298
01:12:26.109 --> 01:12:28.311
- Congrats. bro.
- Yeah. bro.

1299
01:12:28.311 --> 01:12:29.646
I appreciate it. man.

1300
01:12:29.646 --> 01:12:33.417
Hey look. how does it
feel to be a year older?

1301
01:12:33.417 --> 01:12:36.653
- Man honestly. I don't
feel no different.

1302
01:12:36.653 --> 01:12:38.221
- Really?

1303
01:12:38.221 --> 01:12:41.024
You sure as hell.
- What?

1304
01:12:41.024 --> 01:12:42.158
- Is that a gray hair.

1305
01:12:42.158 --> 01:12:43.026
I see gray hair.
- Shut the hell up. man.

1306
01:12:43.026 --> 01:12:45.695
(both laughing)

1307
01:12:48.565 --> 01:12:49.799
- Oh. does someone have
a drinking problem.

1308
01:12:49.799 --> 01:12:51.435
that no one knows about?

1309
01:12:52.569 --> 01:12:53.970
- Girl. it's been a long day.

1310
01:12:55.338 --> 01:12:57.273
You know what else you
didn't really congratulate us

1311
01:12:57.273 --> 01:12:58.708
on our engagement.

1312
01:12:58.708 --> 01:13:00.009
- What?

1313
01:13:00.009 --> 01:13:01.110
I thought I did. Girl.
let me see that ring.

1314
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:02.045
- You know what?

1315
01:13:02.045 --> 01:13:03.312
Just stop Lexi or Jennifer.

1316
01:13:03.312 --> 01:13:04.848
whoever the hell you
wanna be this week.

1317
01:13:04.848 --> 01:13:05.782
- Excuse me.

1318
01:13:05.782 --> 01:13:07.551
- Look. I'm already onto you.

1319
01:13:07.551 --> 01:13:10.987
and I know about you cheating
on Maurice in the past.

1320
01:13:10.987 --> 01:13:13.056
And for some reason he
was blinded by love.

1321
01:13:13.056 --> 01:13:14.624
and took your trifling ass back.

1322
01:13:14.624 --> 01:13:15.992
- Okay. now you're
out of line talking

1323
01:13:15.992 --> 01:13:17.561
about stuff you don't even know.

1324
01:13:17.561 --> 01:13:20.229
- Oh. I know plenty. trust me.

1325
01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:24.634
I understand that you're a
two faced backstabbing bitch

1326
01:13:24.634 --> 01:13:27.403
who will do anything.

1327
01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:30.173
including my man to
get what you want.

1328
01:13:30.173 --> 01:13:32.609
- What you need to do
is leave Brandon alone?

1329
01:13:32.609 --> 01:13:33.877
- Or what. what?

1330
01:13:33.877 --> 01:13:35.612
'Cause you want him?

1331
01:13:35.612 --> 01:13:37.681
'Cause you're in love with him?

1332
01:13:37.681 --> 01:13:41.885
(chuckles) Oh. I betcha
I wanna beat your ass.

1333
01:13:41.885 --> 01:13:44.888
but yeah. I'm too cute for that.

1334
01:13:46.823 --> 01:13:48.725
So how about this?

1335
01:13:48.725 --> 01:13:53.563
I won't blow up your spot
as long as you understand

1336
01:13:53.563 --> 01:13:57.567
that whatever you had
with Brandon it's over.

1337
01:13:59.035 --> 01:14:03.907
because he chose me and
there's nothing you can do

1338
01:14:04.508 --> 01:14:04.841
to change that.

1339
01:14:06.375 --> 01:14:08.512
- Hmm.
- Are we clear?

1340
01:14:09.679 --> 01:14:12.782
- Crystal bestie?

1341
01:14:12.782 --> 01:14:14.183
- Good.

1342
01:14:14.183 --> 01:14:16.252
You know. we should probably
get back to the men.

1343
01:14:16.252 --> 01:14:20.389
and don't forget who
your ass belong to.

1344
01:14:20.389 --> 01:14:23.159
(suspense music)

1345
01:14:25.629 --> 01:14:28.031
(Lexi sighs)

1346
01:14:37.507 --> 01:14:40.810
- That shit right
there. delicious.

1347
01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:43.680
- Yeah. my baby definitely
know what she doing. aint she?

1348
01:14:45.048 --> 01:14:46.716
- Anything for the birthday boy.

1349
01:14:46.716 --> 01:14:47.884
I mean the birthday man.
- Yeah.

1350
01:14:47.884 --> 01:14:51.187
- The birthday man. (chuckles)

1351
01:14:51.187 --> 01:14:55.592
- No. but man. I'm
just extremely happy

1352
01:14:57.060 --> 01:15:00.163
to be sharing this day with
the people I love with most.

1353
01:15:02.966 --> 01:15:03.800
To my wife.

1354
01:15:05.468 --> 01:15:07.737
I love you with all my heart.

1355
01:15:07.737 --> 01:15:10.073
I couldn't imagine spending
this day without you.

1356
01:15:27.223 --> 01:15:29.392
And to my amazing brother.

1357
01:15:33.196 --> 01:15:35.899
so glad you're in my
life. bro. for real.

1358
01:15:38.835 --> 01:15:41.738
and to your now fiance.

1359
01:15:41.738 --> 01:15:43.907
welcome to the family sis.

1360
01:15:43.907 --> 01:15:46.109
- (chuckles) I
appreciate it. bro.

1361
01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:55.384
- Yeah. today's indeed a
special day with Alicia.

1362
01:15:58.021 --> 01:16:02.959
I found a love of my
life and my brother.

1363
01:16:04.093 --> 01:16:05.629
- Hey. now quit trying
to change history.

1364
01:16:05.629 --> 01:16:06.462
I found you.

1365
01:16:07.931 --> 01:16:10.366
- Yeah. yeah. okay. whatever.

1366
01:16:10.366 --> 01:16:13.236
But look. I know it
was really unfortunate

1367
01:16:13.236 --> 01:16:15.872
that we weren't able to
not grow up together.

1368
01:16:15.872 --> 01:16:17.774
but I'm glad that we'll
be able to spend the rest

1369
01:16:17.774 --> 01:16:20.043
of our lives making
up for lost time.

1370
01:16:22.045 --> 01:16:22.879
To family.

1371
01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.782
- [All] To family.

1372
01:16:29.753 --> 01:16:32.521
(phone vibrates)

1373
01:16:34.924 --> 01:16:36.092
- I gotta take this.

1374
01:16:43.099 --> 01:16:45.669
- So y'all set a date yet.

1375
01:16:45.669 --> 01:16:47.203
- Answer the question. babe.

1376
01:16:47.203 --> 01:16:48.437
- I don't know.

1377
01:16:48.437 --> 01:16:50.006
we just got engaged

1378
01:16:50.907 --> 01:16:52.341
(Alicia laughs)

1379
01:16:52.341 --> 01:16:54.077
- I'm jealous of you. bro.

1380
01:16:54.077 --> 01:16:55.411
Now we're messing.

1381
01:16:55.411 --> 01:16:56.780
- Are you in position?

1382
01:16:58.882 --> 01:17:00.449
Okay. great.

1383
01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:02.385
I'll be in touch.

1384
01:17:05.955 --> 01:17:07.924
- Is everything all right?

1385
01:17:07.924 --> 01:17:10.059
- Why do you care?

1386
01:17:10.059 --> 01:17:12.561
Look. I'm just taking
care of a little business.

1387
01:17:12.561 --> 01:17:13.396
- I see.

1388
01:17:14.864 --> 01:17:16.465
- What's that?

1389
01:17:16.465 --> 01:17:18.101
You know what? I'm just
gonna handle my business.

1390
01:17:18.101 --> 01:17:19.268
- Not until we talk.

1391
01:17:19.268 --> 01:17:20.203
- Okay. talk.

1392
01:17:22.271 --> 01:17:23.673
Okay. look. you know I love you.

1393
01:17:23.673 --> 01:17:25.274
- Then why are you marrying her?

1394
01:17:25.274 --> 01:17:28.111
- The same reason that you're
still married to my brother.

1395
01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:30.747
Listen. I offered to
break things off with her.

1396
01:17:30.747 --> 01:17:32.648
but you're like.
"Nah. don't do that."

1397
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:35.685
- I know. but...

1398
01:17:37.286 --> 01:17:38.387
Brandon. this is hard.

1399
01:17:41.657 --> 01:17:43.292
- This is hard
for me too. right.

1400
01:17:45.228 --> 01:17:47.296
My body aches for you.

1401
01:17:47.296 --> 01:17:49.165
I crave for you.

1402
01:17:49.165 --> 01:17:50.066
I love you.

1403
01:17:51.267 --> 01:17:53.602
- Then leave her.

1404
01:17:53.602 --> 01:17:55.104
- Then leave him.

1405
01:17:58.975 --> 01:18:00.076
- I can't right now.

1406
01:18:02.278 --> 01:18:03.479
- Yeah. I know.

1407
01:18:12.889 --> 01:18:14.724
- Hey.
- Hey. you good?

1408
01:18:15.591 --> 01:18:17.026
- More than good.

1409
01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:18.461
- That's what's up.

1410
01:18:18.461 --> 01:18:21.164
See. you got nothing
to worry about.

1411
01:18:23.432 --> 01:18:25.268
- Yeah. let's hope
it stays that way.

1412
01:18:37.646 --> 01:18:40.750
- Here. this is what
we talked about.

1413
01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:42.251
- Brandon?

1414
01:18:42.251 --> 01:18:43.887
- To give you access to
everything that you need.

1415
01:18:43.887 --> 01:18:44.720
- Hey. Brandon.

1416
01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:46.155
You're ready?

1417
01:18:46.155 --> 01:18:48.591
- Yeah. I was just
saying tonight.

1418
01:18:48.591 --> 01:18:50.359
- Good night. Brandon.

1419
01:18:50.359 --> 01:18:51.961
Good night. bestie.

1420
01:18:53.229 --> 01:18:54.297
- Good-bye Lexi.

1421
01:18:55.965 --> 01:18:58.968
(suspenseful music)

1422
01:19:38.207 --> 01:19:40.409
- What you doing?

1423
01:19:40.409 --> 01:19:43.312
- Just making sure everything
straight for tomorrow.

1424
01:19:43.312 --> 01:19:44.213
- Hmm. okay.

1425
01:19:46.715 --> 01:19:49.685
Did you have a good birthday?

1426
01:19:49.685 --> 01:19:50.486
- I did.

1427
01:19:51.454 --> 01:19:53.789
Thank you.
- You're welcome. baby.

1428
01:19:53.789 --> 01:19:56.559
(phone vibrates)

1429
01:20:07.403 --> 01:20:09.138
- You're not going out tonight?

1430
01:20:15.611 --> 01:20:16.412
- No.

1431
01:20:17.646 --> 01:20:21.550
No. not tonight.

1432
01:20:21.550 --> 01:20:23.552
It's your birthday baby.

1433
01:20:28.557 --> 01:20:30.259
- We stay in this
together. right?

1434
01:20:33.296 --> 01:20:34.130
- Always.

1435
01:20:35.431 --> 01:20:36.332
I love you.

1436
01:20:38.467 --> 01:20:39.835
- I love you too.

1437
01:20:41.237 --> 01:20:43.772
(violin music)

1438
01:21:06.862 --> 01:21:09.632
(Brandon scoffs)

1439
01:21:32.321 --> 01:21:33.957
- [Lexi] Hey this is Lexi.

1440
01:21:33.957 --> 01:21:35.091
you know what to do.

1441
01:21:35.091 --> 01:21:36.525
(phone beeps)

1442
01:21:36.525 --> 01:21:38.995
- Lexi. you're not answering
my text or anything.

1443
01:21:39.862 --> 01:21:41.364
Listen. I need to talk to you.

1444
01:21:42.298 --> 01:21:44.667
I need to see you.

1445
01:21:45.901 --> 01:21:47.436
I need to hold you.

1446
01:21:48.604 --> 01:21:50.806
I need to make love to you.

1447
01:21:52.708 --> 01:21:53.776
Call me back.

1448
01:21:59.748 --> 01:22:01.850
(stone thuds)

1449
01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:04.853
(suspenseful music)

1450
01:22:39.488 --> 01:22:40.423
(phone vibrates)

1451
01:22:40.423 --> 01:22:42.925
(tense music)

1452
01:23:13.156 --> 01:23:15.591
(bell dings)

1453
01:23:34.177 --> 01:23:35.010
- Brandon?

1454
01:23:37.146 --> 01:23:39.582
I can't wait for my surprise.

1455
01:23:40.549 --> 01:23:42.885
(gun thuds)

1456
01:23:49.925 --> 01:23:52.095
- Surprise. bitch.

1457
01:23:52.095 --> 01:23:55.098
(suspenseful music)

1458
01:24:18.121 --> 01:24:19.588
Wake up. bestie.

1459
01:24:26.061 --> 01:24:27.563
What's wrong?

1460
01:24:27.563 --> 01:24:30.199
This is not the surprise
you were looking for?

1461
01:24:30.199 --> 01:24:31.033
- Help!

1462
01:24:32.168 --> 01:24:33.369
Help!

1463
01:24:33.369 --> 01:24:34.203
Help!

1464
01:24:36.905 --> 01:24:38.674
- I'd stop screaming.

1465
01:24:39.808 --> 01:24:41.544
'cause nobody can
hear your ass anyway.

1466
01:24:46.549 --> 01:24:48.217
You know what?

1467
01:24:48.217 --> 01:24:49.918
This is nice.

1468
01:24:49.918 --> 01:24:52.921
because you see. I
actually get to talk.

1469
01:24:52.921 --> 01:24:56.091
and you have to sit
here and listen to me.

1470
01:24:58.294 --> 01:25:01.464
Do you know how
much I trusted you?

1471
01:25:02.731 --> 01:25:04.167
I thought you were my friend.

1472
01:25:06.001 --> 01:25:09.037
I thought you were my family.

1473
01:25:11.407 --> 01:25:15.444
and you're behind my back
and you're fucking my man.

1474
01:25:17.713 --> 01:25:20.283
And you know. the whole time
I thought I was going crazy.

1475
01:25:20.283 --> 01:25:23.085
because there is no way you
two would do that to me.

1476
01:25:24.086 --> 01:25:28.224
because Brandon. he loves me.

1477
01:25:29.858 --> 01:25:31.527
that I could trust him.

1478
01:25:32.728 --> 01:25:34.197
and you you were my friend.

1479
01:25:34.197 --> 01:25:36.999
and you would never do
something like that to me.

1480
01:25:39.902 --> 01:25:42.471
I Guess it's a good thing
I listen to my paranoia.

1481
01:25:42.471 --> 01:25:45.474
(suspenseful music)

1482
01:25:46.642 --> 01:25:49.011
You know. it's bitches like you

1483
01:25:49.011 --> 01:25:53.048
that make women like me have
to do crazy shit like this.

1484
01:25:59.988 --> 01:26:01.257
Oh what. what are we?

1485
01:26:01.257 --> 01:26:02.991
Are you looking for Brandon?

1486
01:26:07.363 --> 01:26:11.200
You know this isn't going
to end well for you.

1487
01:26:12.635 --> 01:26:15.003
and it sure as hell isn't
gonna end well for him.

1488
01:26:18.574 --> 01:26:19.442
Bring the man.

1489
01:26:23.512 --> 01:26:25.180
- Sit your ass down.

1490
01:26:34.323 --> 01:26:35.958
- Oh yeah. Maurice is here.

1491
01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:38.594
Well. you know. I couldn't
leave him in the dark

1492
01:26:38.594 --> 01:26:40.996
in this make believe
world like I was.

1493
01:26:40.996 --> 01:26:45.368
so I thought. you know. I
would tell him what's going on.

1494
01:26:47.202 --> 01:26:49.505
Moreso show him.

1495
01:27:00.616 --> 01:27:02.685
- You played a good game.

1496
01:27:04.152 --> 01:27:05.321
but I play even better.

1497
01:27:12.127 --> 01:27:15.664
I can't believe
you did this to me.

1498
01:27:15.664 --> 01:27:18.367
You betrayed me like this
with my own fucking brother.

1499
01:27:21.203 --> 01:27:22.605
You back stabbing bitch.

1500
01:27:22.605 --> 01:27:25.173
(Lexi screams)

1501
01:27:29.278 --> 01:27:31.614
(Lexi sobs)

1502
01:27:43.125 --> 01:27:46.995
- You know. it's a shame
the people who claim

1503
01:27:46.995 --> 01:27:48.897
to love you the most.

1504
01:27:49.898 --> 01:27:51.033
hurt you the worst.

1505
01:27:58.841 --> 01:28:01.944
You know. since you two
wanna be together forever.

1506
01:28:01.944 --> 01:28:06.081
how about we join you two
in holy matrimony. you know.

1507
01:28:06.081 --> 01:28:09.418
make this like a private
wedding celebration.

1508
01:28:09.418 --> 01:28:10.886
- You know what?

1509
01:28:10.886 --> 01:28:12.321
I like that idea.

1510
01:28:14.122 --> 01:28:17.793
Might as well as love birds be
together in holly matrimony.

1511
01:28:17.793 --> 01:28:18.827
To have and to hold.

1512
01:28:18.827 --> 01:28:20.729
Now the other bullshit.

1513
01:28:24.132 --> 01:28:25.133
What is it they say?

1514
01:28:26.001 --> 01:28:27.436
Until death do us apart. right?

1515
01:28:27.436 --> 01:28:31.807
- Mm. you're right. poor friend.

1516
01:28:31.807 --> 01:28:33.976
- We're gonna start. shall we?

1517
01:28:36.111 --> 01:28:41.116
Brandon. do you take Lexi to
be your lawfully wedded wife.

1518
01:28:46.622 --> 01:28:49.091
to have and to hold.

1519
01:28:49.091 --> 01:28:50.926
for richer or for poorer.

1520
01:28:52.127 --> 01:28:54.296
through sickness
and through health.

1521
01:28:55.431 --> 01:28:57.466
until death do you apart?

1522
01:29:01.470 --> 01:29:03.939
Answer the fucking question.

1523
01:29:03.939 --> 01:29:05.608
Answer the question.

1524
01:29:08.744 --> 01:29:09.812
Say it again.

1525
01:29:11.013 --> 01:29:14.016
(suspenseful music)

1526
01:29:17.185 --> 01:29:19.788
(Lexi screams)

1527
01:29:22.057 --> 01:29:23.692
(gun fires)

1528
01:29:23.692 --> 01:29:26.128
(Lexi weeps)

1529
01:29:32.601 --> 01:29:33.669
Why are you crying?

1530
01:29:35.203 --> 01:29:36.705
Your turn.

1531
01:29:36.705 --> 01:29:39.041
(Lexi sobs)

1532
01:29:43.245 --> 01:29:47.516
- Do you Lexi
bitch take Brandon.

1533
01:29:49.552 --> 01:29:50.653
to have and to hold.

1534
01:29:52.354 --> 01:29:55.290
for richer or for poorer.

1535
01:29:55.290 --> 01:29:57.626
in sickness and in health.

1536
01:29:59.227 --> 01:30:00.062
(gun cocks)

1537
01:30:00.062 --> 01:30:01.964
Until death do me part?

1538
01:30:03.331 --> 01:30:06.334
(suspenseful music)

1539
01:30:11.039 --> 01:30:13.375
(gun fires)

1540
01:30:21.416 --> 01:30:22.718
(Lexi sighs)

1541
01:30:22.718 --> 01:30:25.721
(suspenseful music)

1542
01:30:39.201 --> 01:30:41.537
- Are you okay. baby?

1543
01:30:41.537 --> 01:30:43.405
- Your ass was way too
much with that slap.

1544
01:30:43.405 --> 01:30:44.673
- But I had to make
it look believable.

1545
01:30:44.673 --> 01:30:46.241
she should think
I was on her side.

1546
01:30:46.241 --> 01:30:48.076
- Don't do that shit no more.

1547
01:30:48.076 --> 01:30:50.145
- Look. we got the
same branded guns.

1548
01:30:50.145 --> 01:30:51.814
so the police gonna think
she killed. Brandon.

1549
01:30:51.814 --> 01:30:53.682
and then killed herself.

1550
01:30:53.682 --> 01:30:55.183
- The perfect move to suicide.

1551
01:30:55.183 --> 01:30:56.384
- Exactly.

1552
01:30:56.384 --> 01:30:57.586
You got what we need?

1553
01:30:57.586 --> 01:30:58.386
- Yeah.

1554
01:30:59.855 --> 01:31:01.256
This is the flash drive
with that offshore account

1555
01:31:01.256 --> 01:31:02.658
that Brandon set up for me.

1556
01:31:02.658 --> 01:31:04.627
Not knowing that it
gave me access to all

1557
01:31:04.627 --> 01:31:05.694
of his banking accounts.

1558
01:31:05.694 --> 01:31:08.263
- Perfect.
- and his cash account.

1559
01:31:08.263 --> 01:31:09.798
- As soon as work with that one.

1560
01:31:09.798 --> 01:31:10.733
and we'll done here.

1561
01:31:10.733 --> 01:31:11.667
- Okay.

1562
01:31:11.667 --> 01:31:13.201
- You got our next victim ready?

1563
01:31:13.201 --> 01:31:14.036
- Oh yeah.

1564
01:31:15.604 --> 01:31:16.404
Right here.

1565
01:31:19.141 --> 01:31:24.146
Willis Hankerson. single.
black. wealthy. dead parents

1566
01:31:25.614 --> 01:31:27.382
no aunts. no uncles.

1567
01:31:27.382 --> 01:31:29.217
Don't know if he's
got any brothers.

1568
01:31:29.217 --> 01:31:30.052
Practically alone.

1569
01:31:30.052 --> 01:31:32.020
- He sounds perfect.

1570
01:31:32.020 --> 01:31:36.925
So just like last time?
- Yeah.

1571
01:31:36.925 --> 01:31:39.828
- You look like
you could use this.

1572
01:31:41.296 --> 01:31:43.732
- You just so happened
to bump into him.

1573
01:31:49.572 --> 01:31:50.939
You grab something.

1574
01:31:50.939 --> 01:31:52.775
with a sample of his DNA.

1575
01:31:57.813 --> 01:31:58.881
You seduce him.

1576
01:32:04.787 --> 01:32:06.855
And then we engineer
our DNA test

1577
01:32:06.855 --> 01:32:08.591
to show that we are
long lost brothers.

1578
01:32:09.792 --> 01:32:13.061
Speaking of. is our lab
tech taken care of yet?

1579
01:32:13.061 --> 01:32:13.896
- Oh yeah.

1580
01:32:16.264 --> 01:32:19.267
(suspenseful music)

1581
01:32:22.404 --> 01:32:24.372
After I gave her her cut.

1582
01:32:24.372 --> 01:32:26.508
she destroyed all the evidence.

1583
01:32:37.986 --> 01:32:40.689
and she's already in the
next location waiting

1584
01:32:40.689 --> 01:32:41.590
for us to call.

1585
01:32:43.058 --> 01:32:47.095
Are you in position?
- Yep. I already have access

1586
01:32:47.095 --> 01:32:48.130
to the lab.

1587
01:32:48.130 --> 01:32:50.833
I'll see you when you get here.

1588
01:32:50.833 --> 01:32:52.334
- Okay. great.

1589
01:32:53.535 --> 01:32:54.369
I'll be in touch.

1590
01:32:59.908 --> 01:33:01.644
- Okay. in a few more weeks.

1591
01:33:01.644 --> 01:33:03.779
We'll be sitting pretty
than we already are.

1592
01:33:03.779 --> 01:33:06.682
- Hmm. I just hope next time

1593
01:33:06.682 --> 01:33:09.517
there's not any
innocent lives taken.

1594
01:33:10.853 --> 01:33:13.088
I don't like hearing gunshots.

1595
01:33:13.088 --> 01:33:14.322
- Yeah. me too.

1596
01:33:15.991 --> 01:33:17.660
Tragedy of war.

1597
01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:20.595
- Yeah. you know I
tried to warn her.

1598
01:33:20.595 --> 01:33:23.265
I thought after I told
her about our infidelity.

1599
01:33:23.265 --> 01:33:25.333
that she would stay away.

1600
01:33:25.333 --> 01:33:27.102
and end the relationship.

1601
01:33:27.102 --> 01:33:30.839
but no. she just
had to have Brandon.

1602
01:33:30.839 --> 01:33:33.008
That was stubborn bitch.

1603
01:33:33.008 --> 01:33:34.242
- Oh whatever.

1604
01:33:34.242 --> 01:33:35.343
On to the next one.

1605
01:33:35.343 --> 01:33:37.012
- Right. (chuckles)
