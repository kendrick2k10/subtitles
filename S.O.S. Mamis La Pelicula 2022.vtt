so you never have a double chin
like Jacinta's mother.

4
00:00:25.541 --> 00:00:27.083
What a horrible woman. right?

5
00:00:27.208 --> 00:00:29.250
Not like your mommy.
who keeps herself gorgeous.

6
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:33.625
Come on. So you won't have those
women's faces that look like bulldogs.

7
00:00:33.708 --> 00:00:36.083
Make yourself like this.
taps. My precious birthday girl

8
00:00:36.208 --> 00:00:38.916
who is going to have
an active face.

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.291
- Who?
- Me.

10
00:00:40.416 --> 00:00:42.333
Who is going to have a birthday?

11
00:00:42.458 --> 00:00:44.458
- I'm going to have a birthday.
- Who's going to have a birthday?

12
00:00:44.541 --> 00:00:46.708
- I'm going to have a birthday.
- Who's going to have a birthday?

13
00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:49.375
- Me. me. me.
- An unforgettable birthday party.

14
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.125
Puppy. let's review.

15
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.625
- Clarita confirmed?
- No.

16
00:00:53.708 --> 00:00:55.125
She has not confirmed yet.

17
00:00:55.208 --> 00:00:57.000
I really don't understand
how those moms

18
00:00:57.083 --> 00:00:58.958
don't answer WhatsApp.

19
00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:01.250
The bus is about to pass. my love.

20
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:04.250
- Mommy. Blanqui.
- Look. Mom. Sofi.

21
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:05.750
- Sofi.
- Where?

22
00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:08.416
Oh. that's great.
Perfect.

23
00:01:09.291 --> 00:01:10.791
Let's see...

24
00:01:13.416 --> 00:01:14.750
Clarita.

25
00:01:14.875 --> 00:01:16.166
Hello. good morning.

26
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.208
Hello. Piggy. how are you?
I need to know

27
00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:21.125
are you going to my puppy's
birthday on Saturday?

28
00:01:21.208 --> 00:01:22.583
- Obvious.
- Nothing is obvious.

29
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:25.000
You have to confirm on WhatsApp
and you have not done it.

30
00:01:25.083 --> 00:01:27.333
- I thought since we were...
- No need to think.

31
00:01:27.416 --> 00:01:28.750
You have to confirm.

32
00:01:28.833 --> 00:01:30.541
Yes. I confirm. now.

33
00:01:30.625 --> 00:01:33.333
Piggy. the thing is
that I specifically put RSVP.

34
00:01:33.416 --> 00:01:35.916
- And what does that mean?
- Répondez s'il vous plait.

35
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.250
In other words.
answer. in French.

36
00:01:38.375 --> 00:01:41.041
Not in French. you in Spanish.
but responds on WhatsApp.

37
00:01:41.125 --> 00:01:43.083
I thought your keyboard
had been crushed

38
00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:45.666
because I have a kitten. Sunbeam.
who loves to walk

39
00:01:45.791 --> 00:01:48.291
on top of the computer.
and every time I go to send an email

40
00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:50.916
- write letters: MNÑ
- Clarita.

41
00:01:51.041 --> 00:01:53.291
It turns out that this is
a costume party.

42
00:01:53.375 --> 00:01:55.666
but also on the invitation
I put it in another language.

43
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.375
Happy birthday. costume party.

44
00:01:57.458 --> 00:01:59.541
I'm telling you because
I don't want you to ruin the party

45
00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:01.291
by not mastering
the foreign language.

46
00:02:01.375 --> 00:02:03.750
I understand English.
I understand a lot.

47
00:02:03.833 --> 00:02:08.250
- Even once...
- Great. remember to reply on WhatsApp.

48
00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:10.000
- See you at school.
- Bye.

49
00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:13.916
- They left.
- And they didn't take us?

50
00:02:18.291 --> 00:02:21.666
Poor thing. imagine later
she arrives without her disguise.

51
00:02:22.708 --> 00:02:24.750
The bus should be passing by now.

52
00:02:24.833 --> 00:02:26.958
Even the third division
doesn't love you. Luis.

53
00:02:27.041 --> 00:02:30.000
No. look.
it's nothing personal. it's business.

54
00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:32.000
I'm not your mom.
I'm your agent.

55
00:02:32.125 --> 00:02:35.500
Well. I was your agent
because you are out of my schedule.

56
00:02:35.583 --> 00:02:37.458
I can't keep working with you.

57
00:02:37.541 --> 00:02:39.625
Mom. look. I leveled up.

58
00:02:39.708 --> 00:02:41.375
- Very nice. let's see. Alonso.
- James. look.

59
00:02:41.458 --> 00:02:44.666
- Good. Mr. Dante.
- How? Did you have a Maserati?

60
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.083
A Maserati for leasing?

61
00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:51.541
What's that? And the Hummer?
Well. set up a food truck.

62
00:02:51.625 --> 00:02:54.000
Didn't your mom make
some delicious sopaipillas?

63
00:02:54.083 --> 00:02:55.958
That's where the business is. Lucho.

64
00:02:56.708 --> 00:02:58.916
Shanti. shanti.

65
00:02:59.041 --> 00:03:00.666
Moon!

66
00:03:00.875 --> 00:03:03.750
Moon. Moon!
Always on the moon!

67
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:05.875
What's the matter?

68
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.916
Not much. Piggy.

69
00:03:08.041 --> 00:03:10.750
Except that we're on the verge
of dysphonia for shouting at you

70
00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:13.375
because it turns out you have not
confirmed attendance for my puppy's party.

71
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.750
Trini. yesterday I told you
that with my little Buddha

72
00:03:15.833 --> 00:03:19.750
we are happy to be a part
of Sofi's new round in the sun.

73
00:03:19.875 --> 00:03:20.916
Oh. how wonderful. Piggy.

74
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.875
But it turns out that the words are
blown away by the wind. sun or no sun.

75
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.291
So. always on WhatsApp.

76
00:03:26.416 --> 00:03:31.250
And now hurry up. because you are going
to be late for school. come on. my puppy.

77
00:03:31.375 --> 00:03:32.583
[school bell]

78
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.750
Little Buddha. don't fall
to the provocations of that girl.

79
00:03:44.916 --> 00:03:49.458
Remember. a true warrior
faces his fears from love.

80
00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:53.750
- I do not want to enter.
- Oh. my love.

81
00:03:53.833 --> 00:03:56.083
Repeat what your mom told you.

82
00:03:56.208 --> 00:03:58.875
First of all. always be

83
00:03:59.041 --> 00:04:03.000
shanti. shanti. om.

84
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.416
- Better?
- No.

85
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.583
- Breathe with me.
- They come with joy. Lord. singing

86
00:04:06.666 --> 00:04:09.791
come with joy. Lord.

87
00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:14.041
those who walk through life. Lord.

88
00:04:14.208 --> 00:04:16.708
using your peace and love.

89
00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:20.875
Stop. my blessings.

90
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.958
Have a nice day.

91
00:04:23.083 --> 00:04:26.041
Remember. God is always with you

92
00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:28.458
and Our Lady is watching you.
[school bell]

93
00:04:28.666 --> 00:04:29.833
Bye. mom.

94
00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.375
- Good day. bye.
- Bye!

95
00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.250
Good day. my blessings.

[school bell]

97
00:04:38.541 --> 00:04:40.666
Miracles.

98
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.250
Good morning. Miracles.

99
00:04:42.375 --> 00:04:44.958
- Good morning. father Anthony.
- You know?

100
00:04:45.083 --> 00:04:46.750
This Sunday.

101
00:04:46.833 --> 00:04:50.500
the choir is going to perform
the song you suggested to us.

102
00:04:50.625 --> 00:04:51.875
Seriously?

103
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.291
Thank you very much for sharing it.

104
00:04:54.416 --> 00:04:56.708
What is the name of the song?

105
00:04:56.791 --> 00:05:00.666
It's called "It's like a miracle."

106
00:05:02.458 --> 00:05:05.541
It's like a miracle

107
00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.375
my whole life

108
00:05:09.291 --> 00:05:11.541
It lighted up.

109
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.875
you. you are my lighthouse

110
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.208
[piano]

111
00:05:18.458 --> 00:05:20.500
you bring me light.

112
00:05:20.583 --> 00:05:24.541
you are my Lord.

113
00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:28.666
- It's very sticky. very sticky.
- Very sticky. very sticky.

114
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:29.875
What is it called again?

115
00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.916
It is like a miracle.

116
00:05:32.041 --> 00:05:34.375
No. Miracles.
you are a miracle!

117
00:05:34.541 --> 00:05:38.958
- See you Sunday.
- Have a nice day. father Anthony.

118
00:05:39.208 --> 00:05:40.250
Miracles.

119
00:05:40.375 --> 00:05:41.583
[fade out sound]

120
00:05:41.875 --> 00:05:43.958
You're in a little trance or what.

121
00:05:44.083 --> 00:05:46.250
- With Father Anthony?
- No. no. not at all.

122
00:05:46.333 --> 00:05:49.041
We were talking about an issue

123
00:05:49.166 --> 00:05:51.916
and. well. it doesn't matter.
how can I help you?

124
00:05:52.041 --> 00:05:55.375
It turns out. Piggy. you haven't confirmed
your attendance at my puppy's birthday

125
00:05:55.458 --> 00:05:56.916
and you. especially you.

126
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.958
as treasurer of the class.
you should set the example. right?

127
00:06:00.041 --> 00:06:01.458
- Vice President.
- Treasurer.

128
00:06:01.541 --> 00:06:03.416
- Is the same.
- No. it's not the same.

129
00:06:03.583 --> 00:06:05.250
Well. it doesn't matter.

130
00:06:05.375 --> 00:06:08.458
Anyway. yesterday I told you
we were going.

131
00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:10.416
Well. but as the protocol says.

132
00:06:10.541 --> 00:06:13.500
if it is not on WhatsApp
it does not exist. Exactly.

133
00:06:13.583 --> 00:06:14.750
It does not exist.
so on WhatsApp.

134
00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:18.666
- Ok. Piggy. on WhatsApp.
- Much better. add three more zeros.

135
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:19.750
Julia.

136
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:22.416
I am with Real Madrid
here on the phone.

137
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.000
- It's my puppy's birthday.
- I confirmed by email. honey.

138
00:06:25.083 --> 00:06:26.250
On WhatsApp. always on WhatsApp.

139
00:06:26.333 --> 00:06:29.125
WhatsApp is useless.
No i'm not talking to you

140
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.250
- how can you think.
- WhatsApp. Julia. WhatsApp.

141
00:06:31.375 --> 00:06:33.125
You. never. Forget it.

142
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.000
No. no. no.

143
00:06:35.166 --> 00:06:36.666
Hello. dear.

144
00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.916
- Hello.
- Was it stolen?

145
00:06:39.041 --> 00:06:40.958
- What?
- Your telephone.

146
00:06:41.083 --> 00:06:42.291
No. it was not stolen.

147
00:06:42.458 --> 00:06:44.708
It's that two days ago
I sent you the flyer

148
00:06:44.791 --> 00:06:46.541
for this year's
Dodgeball Championship

149
00:06:46.666 --> 00:06:48.708
and you didn't answer.

150
00:06:48.791 --> 00:06:50.541
No. I didn't receive the message.

151
00:06:50.666 --> 00:06:54.791
Well. as the undisputed
champion of the last five years

152
00:06:54.916 --> 00:06:59.791
I want to invite the former
former former former

153
00:06:59.916 --> 00:07:02.750
former champion to participate.

154
00:07:02.833 --> 00:07:06.875
- Ok. I will answer when I get home.
- I have it here.

155
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.833
You can see it now.

156
00:07:09.875 --> 00:07:12.416
No. this year
I am not going to participate.

157
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.125
18TH MOMS DODGEBALL CHAMPIONSHIP

158
00:07:16.625 --> 00:07:18.916
She comes and puts
that poster all over my face

159
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
like a model in decline.
horrible. did you see it?

160
00:07:22.166 --> 00:07:25.625
[notifications]

161
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.375
And on top of that.
the operated Viking invited herself.

162
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:30.666
Oh. Lord.

163
00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.541
It seems that the silicone
went to her head.

164
00:07:32.666 --> 00:07:35.250
- If she ever had a head.
- Who has to operate?

165
00:07:35.375 --> 00:07:37.541
Me. on the nerves ever since María Gracia
[ambulance]

166
00:07:37.625 --> 00:07:39.333
invited herself
to my Puppy's celebration.

167
00:07:39.416 --> 00:07:41.625
It is really difficult
the sorority with her.

168
00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.375
with her and her little group of moms.
[vomiting]

169
00:07:44.458 --> 00:07:47.291
Well. anyway. to all the moms
who confirmed her attendance.

170
00:07:47.375 --> 00:07:50.666
I'm going to send them a spectacular
Tik Tok that we did with Sofi

171
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.125
with all the instructions
for the birthday.

172
00:07:52.208 --> 00:07:54.125
Instructions for the party?

173
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.500
And what happened

Speaking of delay. there are
mothers who are very behind

183
00:08:22.875 --> 00:08:26.458
with the mandatory solidarity aid
for the Old Age Foundation.

184
00:08:26.583 --> 00:08:30.375
I'm going to send a spreadsheet
with all the moms who are late.

I'm on the board of directors coordinating

187
00:08:35.708 --> 00:08:37.541
Well. the only debtor is Clarita.

188
00:08:37.666 --> 00:08:39.666
who owes 4 kilos
of basmati brown rice.

189
00:08:39.791 --> 00:08:41.583
because all the mothers committed to

190
00:08:41.708 --> 00:08:43.916
a unit of non-perishable
food per month.

191
00:08:44.041 --> 00:08:47.375
and you are already 4 months behind.

192
00:08:48.041 --> 00:08:49.958
Couldn't it be normal rice?

193
00:08:50.041 --> 00:08:52.291
- It's cheaper.
- No. No way.

194
00:08:52.416 --> 00:08:55.666
Because brown basmati rice
is good for digestion.

195
00:08:55.791 --> 00:08:57.500
for the digestion of grandparents.

196
00:08:57.583 --> 00:09:00.125
- Or do you want them to get sick?
- No!

197
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.166
What does it cost to donate
a little bit of good rice?

198
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:06.708
How miserable. Clarita.

199
00:09:06.833 --> 00:09:09.583
Well. Father Hurtado himself.
may he rest in peace.

200
00:09:09.708 --> 00:09:11.416
said that you have to give
until it hurts.

201
00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.541
and maybe a kilo
of basmati rice hurts Clarita.

202
00:09:14.625 --> 00:09:16.208
because it is an expensive product.

203
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:19.291
You say she has financial problems?

204
00:09:19.416 --> 00:09:23.375
No. it is bad taste to talk about money.

237
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.875

In the invitation it was very clear

238
00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.208
that the costumes
could not be repeated.

239
00:10:58.333 --> 00:11:00.875
- Repeated? Who has repeated disguise?
- You. dear.

240
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.375
We are the fairies
of the Enchanted Forest.

241
00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:08.916
No. we are fairy princesses
of the Enchanted Forest.

242
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.458
That is why we have crowns.

243
00:11:10.583 --> 00:11:13.708
- Can't you see them?
- You'll understand that commoner fairies

244
00:11:13.833 --> 00:11:17.500
are not the same as fairy princesses.

245
00:11:17.625 --> 00:11:21.416
Well. it also said in the invitation
that if you were late

246
00:11:21.541 --> 00:11:25.791
you couldn't enter and you're late.
so even law is not hard. bye. sorry.

- that I had noo money.
- You got your wallet.

Me? Why should I know.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:15.000
- Because you are close to her. right?
- Close to Clarita?

301
00:14:15.291 --> 00:14:17.708
- No.
- Who is Clarita?

Wait. we know each other.
but we are not close.

Hey. what are they talking about?

313
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.250
We just happened to be wondering

314
00:14:51.375 --> 00:14:54.166
if you were having any problems.

are with some difficulty.

Yes. the truth is yes.

320
00:15:08.583 --> 00:15:11.166
Blanquita has been lowering her grades.

321
00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:13.041
- but she promised me...
- No. no. no.

322
00:15:13.125 --> 00:15:14.791
we are not referring
to that type of problem.

323
00:15:14.875 --> 00:15:18.000
but rather to a personal cost problem.

324
00:15:18.125 --> 00:15:20.916
One that makes you ashamed to tell it.

325
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.375
If I need tampons?

326
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:25.125
No. they want to know if you
have flow problems.

327
00:15:25.416 --> 00:15:28.041
No. if I am a super regular flow.

328
00:15:28.166 --> 00:15:32.458
Ay Clarita. they are asking you
if you have money problems.

329
00:15:36.541 --> 00:15:39.833
Yes. but since we are now going
to leave from school with Blanquita

330
00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.000
it will fix the whole problem.
so don't worry.

331
00:15:42.083 --> 00:15:43.791
What? You are going to leave
the Saint Michael School?

332
00:15:43.916 --> 00:15:45.291
- Yes.
- But Clarita. by God.

333
00:15:45.375 --> 00:15:47.833
How could you not tell us
that you are in financial trouble?

334
00:15:47.916 --> 00:15:50.041
But I did tell you
in the class chat.

Hey. is it true that school fees
are going up again?

337
00:15:56.041 --> 00:15:59.208
It's that since I'm out of work.
I don't know how I'm going to pay.

338
00:15:59.291 --> 00:16:01.250
As I have been without work
for more than a year

339
00:16:01.333 --> 00:16:03.666
could it take me a little while
to pay the ride fee?

340
00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:06.833
Couldn't it be normal rice?
It's cheaper.

341
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.875
- Yes.
- What happened to all your ventures?

342
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.208
The most important was
the happy chicken eggs.

343
00:16:15.333 --> 00:16:18.625
Remember? But Miracles did not
let me sell more in the chat.

344
00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:22.250
- What? How?
- The rules specifically say

345
00:16:22.375 --> 00:16:26.458
nothing can be sold in the group.
and the rules are set by Trinidad.

346
00:16:26.583 --> 00:16:29.000
Well. all my eggs got rotten.

347
00:16:29.083 --> 00:16:31.583
Later. since we had to move
to a smaller apartment.

348
00:16:31.708 --> 00:16:33.041
the chickens became depressed.

349
00:16:33.125 --> 00:16:36.083
because I imagine that
all in the same cage

350
00:16:36.166 --> 00:16:37.791
it must not be a very happy thing.

351
00:16:37.916 --> 00:16:39.250
So. afterwards I tried to sell them.

352
00:16:39.333 --> 00:16:42.333
But since it cannot be sold in the chat.
we ate them with Blanquita.

353
00:16:42.416 --> 00:16:43.666
It was a bit unpleasant for us.

354
00:16:43.791 --> 00:16:46.791
we were sick for about two weeks.
but now we are fine.

355
00:16:46.916 --> 00:16:49.750
- And your ex-husband?
- No. thank God he did not eat.

356
00:16:49.916 --> 00:16:52.125
- so he's fine.
- Does he pay the alimony?

357
00:16:52.708 --> 00:16:56.208
Oh. please. let's stop talking
about this and leave her alone.

358
00:16:56.583 --> 00:16:58.291
Does he pay or not?

359
00:16:59.166 --> 00:17:00.583
Yes.

360
00:17:00.708 --> 00:17:04.541
I mean. sometimes. it depends.

361
00:17:05.125 --> 00:17:08.708
Hey. Trini. the cake
is exquisite. delicious.

362
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.333
- I didn't make it. I bought it.
- Really?

363
00:17:11.458 --> 00:17:13.791
Hey. I make cakes too.
so you remember

364
00:17:13.875 --> 00:17:15.750
- for the next birthday.
- But how did you not warn before?

365
00:17:15.833 --> 00:17:18.041
But if I warned by the chat. Sorry.

366
00:17:20.625 --> 00:17:23.750
The most wonderful party in the
history of Saint Michael School.

367
00:17:23.875 --> 00:17:25.333
We made it. didn't we. my love?

368
00:17:25.416 --> 00:17:27.000
Dear diary.
what a good time we had.

369
00:17:27.083 --> 00:17:28.833
Blah. blah. blah.

370
00:17:30.708 --> 00:17:34.291
- What is it. my love?
- I'm sad.

371
00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:39.416
Why do you feel sad? My Puppy.
everything turned out incredible.

372
00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:42.958
Because Blanqui is leaving school.

373
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.791
That's not gonna happen.

374
00:17:49.666 --> 00:17:52.083
- Can you promise me?
- Yes.

375
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:56.291
I promise you.

376
00:17:57.791 --> 00:18:01.500
Don't think that I have anything personal
against Clarita. because I'm not.

377
00:18:01.583 --> 00:18:04.875
I have absolutely nothing
personal against her. but. God.

378
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.333
what a lack of grit.
punch. character.

379
00:18:08.458 --> 00:18:10.708
at the first hurdle
she throws in the towel

380
00:18:10.833 --> 00:18:13.291
and takes her puppy out
of Saint Michael School.

381
00:18:13.375 --> 00:18:15.416
selfish too. because
she doesn't think about our puppy.

382
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.291
Sofi can be left with
a terrible trauma from all this.

383
00:18:19.583 --> 00:18:21.083
Aha.

384
00:18:22.083 --> 00:18:24.083
I can't say I blame her

385
00:18:24.208 --> 00:18:27.583
for not being like me.
a warrior who doesn't give up.

386
00:18:30.541 --> 00:18:32.083
You know what?

387
00:18:32.208 --> 00:18:36.000
Sofi is going to realize that she has a
mother who always keeps her promises.

388
00:18:36.083 --> 00:18:38.916
that's right. I keep them.
I am a mother who is a winner.

389
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.375
and the winners
are capable of changing destiny.

390
00:18:43.666 --> 00:18:46.916
I thank you so much. Pig.
you always listen to me so concentrated.

391
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.750
God. how loving.

392
00:18:49.708 --> 00:18:51.500
And God. what a handsome man.

393
00:18:51.791 --> 00:18:54.208
The first thing that comes
to mind to help her...

394
00:18:54.291 --> 00:18:57.250
- A raffle.
- How did you know?

395
00:18:57.375 --> 00:19:00.083
Because in this country they solve
everything with raffles.

396
00:19:00.166 --> 00:19:01.666
No. Miracles. under
no circumstances. no way.

397
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:03.666
What we have to do
is find her a good job

398
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:05.458
so she stops selling things online.

399
00:19:05.541 --> 00:19:06.625
Why don't she work at Uber?

400
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:08.625
It is a serious company.
which is publicly traded.

401
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.583
Clarita is ecological like me.
She doesn't have a car.

402
00:19:11.708 --> 00:19:13.541
Well. I'll lend her one.

403
00:19:13.666 --> 00:19:15.791
- I love the idea.
- Sugarfree.

404
00:19:15.916 --> 00:19:18.958
Perfect. we can create a solidarity
fund and help her pay for the gasoline.

405
00:19:19.041 --> 00:19:22.208
I could do an aura cleanse
to attract abundance.

406
00:19:22.333 --> 00:19:24.583
Wow. excellent contribution. Moon.

407
00:19:24.708 --> 00:19:26.958
bravo. you move me.

408
00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:28.750
- As vice president
- Treasurer.

409
00:19:28.833 --> 00:19:30.416
- Is the same.
- Is not the same.

410
00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:34.208
Well. I think we should vote
on the raffle and not rule it out.

411

413
00:19:41.791 --> 00:19:44.583
- Oh. how exciting.
- Can I see?

414
00:19:44.666 --> 00:19:47.416
No. no. not yet.
We are almost there. Just a little bit.

415
00:19:47.541 --> 00:19:49.333
I put you in position.
Are you ready?

416
00:19:49.458 --> 00:19:51.541
One. two. three. surprise!

417
00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.208
What a surprise!

418
00:19:55.333 --> 00:19:56.375
How nice to meet you.

419
00:19:56.458 --> 00:19:58.583
No. no. I'm not your surprise.
let me go!

420
00:19:59.625 --> 00:20:02.708
The surprise is the car. it is for you.

421
00:20:02.916 --> 00:20:05.833
No. it is a loan.
but without interest.

422
00:20:05.916 --> 00:20:07.375
- What?
- For you to work at Uber.

423
00:20:07.458 --> 00:20:10.166
Because we know that you
have serious financial problems

424
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:12.208
and so we thought this might help you.

425
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:14.666
Thanks.

426
00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:17.083
- But the thing is I...
- She wants to try it. I know.

427
00:20:17.166 --> 00:20:20.583
Yes. you can't take it anymore. you
want to drive. In and start the engines.

428
00:20:20.708 --> 00:20:23.333
- Come on. now. ready. we're going.
- Make it short...

429
00:20:23.458 --> 00:20:26.125
because I have a lot to do.
I am very busy.

430
00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:29.250
- Come in. come in.
- Woman. hey.

431
00:20:29.375 --> 00:20:30.958
Ready. let's go.

[mimics acceleration]

433
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.125
It looks like a spaceship.

434
00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:39.583
- Nice. no? Put your seatbelts on.
- Yeah. yeah. yeah.

435
00:20:39.708 --> 00:20:41.333
There is the key.

436
00:20:41.875 --> 00:20:43.833
- But it's missing a piece.
- Oh. Piggy.

437
00:20:43.958 --> 00:20:46.291
How sweet. no.
These are the modern keys.

438
00:20:46.458 --> 00:20:47.958
This is how it turns on.

439
00:20:49.291 --> 00:20:51.333
We are going on a trip.

440
00:20:56.791 --> 00:20:59.000
[strong music]

441
00:21:00.916 --> 00:21:03.958
- Can you drive. Clarita?
- No.

442
00:21:04.083 --> 00:21:05.583
And you?

443
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.375
- We teach you. then.
- No.

444
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.958
My ex used to say that
I was too dumb to learn.

445
00:21:11.041 --> 00:21:13.750
No man can tell you
that you are stupid.

446
00:21:13.875 --> 00:21:17.500
It is the typical patriarchy strategy
for you to doubt your abilities.

447
00:21:17.625 --> 00:21:19.916
You are not stupid.
you are poor. not stupid.

448
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.750
But he said it to me with affection.

449
00:21:21.875 --> 00:21:24.041
No man calls you stupid with
affection. you stupid.

450
00:21:24.125 --> 00:21:25.750
Oh. Julia. really. what a drag.

451
00:21:25.875 --> 00:21:28.458
- Not all men are bad.
- Piggy. I didn't say that.

452
00:21:28.583 --> 00:21:32.541
For example. my Chancho. besides being
handsome. is the least patriarchal man.

453
00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:34.916
I ask him to help me with the puppies and
he does it happily. without complaining.

454
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.250
That is the problem.
He doesn't help. He is the father.

455
00:21:39.375 --> 00:21:40.958
You are not understanding. Piggy.

456
00:21:41.041 --> 00:21:42.916
Oh. for example once.
do you know what he did?

457
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.125
He changed a diaper that had poo.
And he didn't say anything.

458
00:21:46.333 --> 00:21:47.750
There you have. I win.

459
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.416
That is normal.

460
00:21:49.625 --> 00:21:50.625
Not for everyone.

461
00:21:50.916 --> 00:21:53.666
My ex had a terrible allergy
to diaper plastic.

462
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:56.833
- If I passed him a diaper. he said "ah"
- How could you believe him?

463
00:21:56.916 --> 00:21:59.125
Get off. bitch!
Get off the car. damn! Get off. you shit!

464
00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:01.958
- Now. quick. get out of the car!
- Quiet.

465
00:22:02.041 --> 00:22:04.458
Open the door. get down!
Get off quickly. asshole!

466
00:22:04.541 --> 00:22:06.291
That's what I'm doing.
I have a seatbelt problem.

467
00:22:06.375 --> 00:22:08.625
- I'm working on it. take it easy.
- Get down!

468
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:11.250
- You calm. you calm !?
- Get down. bitch. quickly!

469
00:22:11.375 --> 00:22:13.041
- Get out of the car!
- Julia. Julia! How do you get this out?

470

Julia. Julia!

471
00:22:15.083 --> 00:22:18.000
We are not understanding each other.
Listen to me. listen to me.

472
00:22:18.083 --> 00:22:22.625
My car was stolen outside my house.

473
00:22:23.166 --> 00:22:25.458
Okay? It's ridiculous.

474
00:22:27.666 --> 00:22:31.875
Yes. but I've been waiting for 20 minutes
and still no one shows up here.

475
00:22:32.375 --> 00:22:34.000
What an absurd world. right?

476
00:22:34.083 --> 00:22:36.333
Never. ever in my life had
a gun been pointed at me.

477
00:22:36.416 --> 00:22:38.750
I felt the same as you
the first time it happened to me.

478
00:22:38.875 --> 00:22:41.708
I was ten years old
and they hit me with a gun in the head

479
00:22:41.833 --> 00:22:42.958
because I couldn't stop talking.

480
00:22:43.041 --> 00:22:47.166
But you get used to everything. Trini.
after the second time it's easier.

481
00:22:47.333 --> 00:22:50.041
Wait. sorry.
Is it the second time that happens to you?

482
00:22:50.125 --> 00:22:52.708
- No. the fifth.
- Finally!

[doorbell]

484
00:23:04.833 --> 00:23:07.666
- Why did you open me up?
- What?

485
00:23:07.791 --> 00:23:10.000
I could point a gun at your head
and kidnap you if I want.

486
00:23:10.083 --> 00:23:12.083
No. please no. how awful.

487
00:23:12.875 --> 00:23:16.125

your neighbor and president of PNA.

- Julia Cox. nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. you are beautiful.

491
00:23:25.583 --> 00:23:29.625
Well. we received a report of screaming
and a possible kidnapping in the area.

492
00:23:29.791 --> 00:23:32.208
No. it was a robbery.
but we're fine. thank you.

I am in charge of a team.
I am trained.

495
00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:41.125
Julia. I am very concerned that
you are not in Neighbor Super Safe.

496
00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:43.666
- What's that?
- The app that we neighbors have

497
00:23:43.916 --> 00:23:47.291
to attack crime.
to keep it very close to us.

498

499
00:23:50.791 --> 00:23:53.541
I used it to sell alfajores there
until they blocked me.

500
00:23:53.625 --> 00:23:55.416
Well. it is important that you join

501
00:23:55.541 --> 00:23:57.916
- because we need more PLO.
- PLU. What's that?

502

People Like Us.

503
00:23:59.541 --> 00:24:01.500
Like you. like me.

504
00:24:02.375 --> 00:24:05.041
Let's check your cameras.
I am very interested to know

505
00:24:05.125 --> 00:24:08.208
if it is not the same band of foreigners
that scares this neighborhood.

506
00:24:08.291 --> 00:24:09.750
No. they were Chilean.

507
00:24:09.875 --> 00:24:11.291
Chileans?

508
00:24:11.416 --> 00:24:14.708
They perfectly imitate
the national accent.

Bájate. sapa culiá.
bájate del auto. culiao.

00:24:20.416 --> 00:24:23.041
Do the subjects in the back
have identification?

511
00:24:23.166 --> 00:24:24.666
- They are my friends.
- Chilean?

00:24:24.791 --> 00:24:26.916
- I was born in Mulchén.
- Me in Vitacura.

513
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.791
Well. I am calmer.

514
00:24:28.916 --> 00:24:31.500
Ok. let's see your images.
please. from your cameras.

515
00:24:31.625 --> 00:24:33.250
What?
I don't have.

516
00:24:34.666 --> 00:24:36.166
Your negligence is impressive.

517
00:24:36.291 --> 00:24:37.708
You let crime roam
your house freely.

518
00:24:37.833 --> 00:24:39.791
in a neighborhood
that is also so dangerous.

519
00:24:39.916 --> 00:24:42.291
But if this is a quiet neighborhood.
come on.

520
00:24:42.416 --> 00:24:43.458
Easy. Julia.

521
00:24:43.583 --> 00:24:46.708
Don't you realize that Chile
woke up? The turnstiles were dropped.

522
00:24:46.791 --> 00:24:48.625
but what happened?
Crime entered.

523
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:51.791
The immigrants. the white slave trade.

524
00:24:51.875 --> 00:24:53.666
[radio calling]
Suspicious man at children's games.

525
00:24:53.791 --> 00:24:56.291
I repeat. suspicious man
in children's games.

526
00:24:56.416 --> 00:24:59.333
Copy. I'm heading to the place.
Change and out. protocol start.

527
00:24:59.458 --> 00:25:02.833
Julia. please install cameras
and connect to the app.

528
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.791
I will do it immediately.

529
00:25:05.875 --> 00:25:08.416
I'll install the cameras for you.
I've done it before.

530
00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:09.958
Clarita. it doesn't matter. forget it.

531
00:25:10.041 --> 00:25:11.291
Not. really.

532
00:25:11.416 --> 00:25:13.833
Besides. I feel so responsible
for what happened.

533
00:25:14.291 --> 00:25:15.625
Leave it to me.

534
00:25:15.708 --> 00:25:17.666
I told you it was much better
to have a raffle.

535
00:25:17.791 --> 00:25:20.000
- No. Miracles. no.
- And a bingo?

536
00:25:20.083 --> 00:25:21.500
No. what we really need

537
00:25:21.583 --> 00:25:23.458
is to go to Saint Michael School
and talk to Regina.

538
00:25:23.541 --> 00:25:25.833
because she is the Principal.
the only one who really knows

539
00:25:25.958 --> 00:25:29.583
- the size of Clarita's problem.
- No. it's bad taste to talk about money.

540
00:25:29.791 --> 00:25:32.208
Extreme times
require extreme measures.

541
00:25:32.333 --> 00:25:35.541
- I need you. Vice President.
- Treasurer.

542
00:25:35.666 --> 00:25:37.541
When it suits you.

543
00:25:39.791 --> 00:25:43.083
Well. it is not my place
to give details of the amount

544
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:45.125
because it is a private matter.
right?

545
00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:50.500
But since you are so willing to help Clara

546
00:25:50.625 --> 00:25:53.500
I must tell you that she owes

547
00:25:53.625 --> 00:25:57.458
more than one year and six
months of monthly payments.

548
00:25:57.583 --> 00:25:59.708
- What?
- Yes.

549
00:25:59.833 --> 00:26:01.250
As you heard it.

550
00:26:01.375 --> 00:26:02.916
One year and 6 months.

551
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.541
What's more. I'm going to give you
the exact amount.

552
00:26:06.791 --> 00:26:12.666
[school bell]

553
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.458
Plus interests.

554
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:19.291
Okay.

555
00:26:19.416 --> 00:26:22.583
Now. considering the number of years that
Clarita has been in our school community

556
00:26:22.708 --> 00:26:25.000
Couldn't. I don't know.
have some kind of grant?

557
00:26:25.083 --> 00:26:27.708
Or a discount
on the total of the figures.

558
00:26:27.833 --> 00:26:29.333
Of course.

559
00:26:30.291 --> 00:26:31.791
Let's see...

560
00:26:33.333 --> 00:26:35.041
Trinidad.

561
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.166
Miracles.

562
00:26:38.166 --> 00:26:41.291
I truly applaud your kindness.

563
00:26:41.625 --> 00:26:43.666
but I will be very clear with you.

564
00:26:45.208 --> 00:26:47.958
This is a catholic school.

565
00:26:49.208 --> 00:26:51.375
it is not a foundation.

566
00:26:58.583 --> 00:27:02.250
Look. Clarita.
it's working surprisingly well.

567
00:27:02.375 --> 00:27:04.875
I just need to hide
some cables like this one.

568
00:27:04.958 --> 00:27:06.750
that one. that one.
that one over there.

569
00:27:06.875 --> 00:27:08.083
that one and the one above.

570
00:27:08.166 --> 00:27:09.625
- and we are ready.
- Right.

571
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:12.708
- How much do I owe you?
- I can't charge you.

572
00:27:12.833 --> 00:27:16.208
Imagine. moreover. because of me
they stole your car.

573
00:27:16.333 --> 00:27:18.458
How do you think you
are going to work for free?

574
00:27:18.541 --> 00:27:21.458
- You're not going to make money that way.
- With the time we have spent together

575
00:27:21.541 --> 00:27:24.291
I consider myself paid.
I prefer to be rich in experiences.

576
00:27:24.416 --> 00:27:26.250
With the experiences
the rent is not paid.

577
00:27:26.333 --> 00:27:28.250
You're too good. Clarita.
[alarm]

578
00:27:28.375 --> 00:27:31.916
- But...
- Oh. it's working amazing!

579
00:27:32.125 --> 00:27:34.583
And the speakers work great.

580
00:27:35.125 --> 00:27:37.416
But how do we turn this thing off?

581
00:27:37.541 --> 00:27:40.000
Good question.
I do not know.

582
00:27:40.083 --> 00:27:41.541
- Give me a minute.
- Right.

583
00:27:42.083 --> 00:27:45.625
Let's see. how to turn off.

584
00:27:46.583 --> 00:27:48.458
How? How?
How to turn off?

585
00:27:48.916 --> 00:27:51.416
[alarm keeps ringing]

586
00:27:53.375 --> 00:27:56.208
I feel such a great pity for Clarita.

587
00:27:56.333 --> 00:28:00.500
because. she is so alone. living all this
in total and absolute solitude.

588
00:28:00.791 --> 00:28:04.125
She has no one like you to talk to.
to support her.

589
00:28:05.416 --> 00:28:09.666
And you know what? She doesn't want to
tell us how much the ex owes her.

590
00:28:09.791 --> 00:28:12.250
I think she is dying of shame.

591
00:28:13.791 --> 00:28:15.291
I don't know.

592
00:28:15.458 --> 00:28:19.333
she doesn't realize the damage
this troglodyte has done to her.

593
00:28:19.583 --> 00:28:21.208
It's like she's blind.

594
00:28:23.541 --> 00:28:26.166
Of course. Pig. blind.

595
00:28:26.291 --> 00:28:28.000
Blind. that's the point.

596
00:28:28.083 --> 00:28:30.458
It is as if she were blind and
we have to remove the bandage.

597
00:28:30.541 --> 00:28:33.583
we have to take it off.
we have to make an intervention

598
00:28:33.708 --> 00:28:37.166
and really know what
situation she is in with her ex.

599
00:28:39.416 --> 00:28:42.625
My God you're lucid. really.

600
00:28:43.541 --> 00:28:45.625
[boiling kettle]

601
00:28:59.125 --> 00:29:02.666
When my ex left
he took all the dishes

602
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:05.708
because he said that I would
never receive anyone.

603
00:29:05.833 --> 00:29:07.708
And look at me now.

604
00:29:10.083 --> 00:29:11.833
What about your ex?

605
00:29:12.041 --> 00:29:15.416
How long has he not paid the alimony?

606
00:29:16.041 --> 00:29:17.250
[coughs]

607
00:29:17.833 --> 00:29:20.333
Sorry. sorry. talking about money
affects me a lot.

608
00:29:20.458 --> 00:29:22.416
We are eight hours apart from Dubai.

609
00:29:22.541 --> 00:29:24.833
mamas. please.
I have two sheiks at the bar

610
00:29:24.916 --> 00:29:26.750
waiting for me
to close a player's pass.

611
00:29:26.875 --> 00:29:28.958
Let's cut to the chase.

612
00:29:29.208 --> 00:29:30.625
One month ago.

613
00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:32.875
It's been a month
since it's been six months

614
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.708
since I don't know anything about him.
and there he already owed me a year.

615
00:29:36.833 --> 00:29:39.958
- Then it would be...
- 18.

616
00:29:40.583 --> 00:29:41.916
Does he owe you 18 months?

617
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000
Well. months. months
and months. yes. 18.

618
00:29:46.125 --> 00:29:48.500
Clarita. I will put you
in touch with my lawyers.

619
00:29:48.625 --> 00:29:51.083
Two threats and he will
never forget to pay again.

620
00:29:51.166 --> 00:29:53.208
No. no. no.
I don't want to bring lawyers here.

621
00:29:53.291 --> 00:29:56.625
No. I don't want to damage
Andrés's relationship with Blanquita.

622
00:29:56.750 --> 00:30:00.291
[exclamations]
Do the two of them see each other a lot?

623
00:30:00.416 --> 00:30:04.041
- No.
- Well. and when was the last time?

624
00:30:04.166 --> 00:30:05.416
One month ago.

625
00:30:05.541 --> 00:30:09.416
A month ago it was 10 months
since he started dating a girl.

626
00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:12.166
so he has not been able to see her
because he has to be with her girlfriend.

627
00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:15.750
And who am I. tell me.
to get into a relationship?

628
00:30:15.833 --> 00:30:17.458
And before that
he had been working a lot.

629
00:30:17.541 --> 00:30:19.458
a lot. a lot. a lot. a lot. a lot.

630
00:30:19.583 --> 00:30:21.500
And on the weekends he had to travel.

631
00:30:21.625 --> 00:30:25.875
So they haven't seen
each other for two years.

632
00:30:27.416 --> 00:30:28.583
Two years?

633
00:30:28.666 --> 00:30:31.708
Clarita. you have to assert yourself.
Demand what is rightfully yours.

634
00:30:31.791 --> 00:30:33.375
No. I don't want to abuse him.

635
00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:36.416
But he is the abuser.

636
00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:37.791
Is just he has done so badly.

637
00:30:37.916 --> 00:30:41.333
so bad at his job
that he had to file for bankruptcy.

638
00:30:41.458 --> 00:30:43.500
So. he has nothing. no. no.

639
00:30:43.625 --> 00:30:46.250
And you. Clarita. have you never saved?

640
00:30:46.375 --> 00:30:48.416
- Yes. yes. yes.
- Yes.

641
00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:49.666
And what happened to the money?

642
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:50.875
[coughs]

643
00:30:51.083 --> 00:30:54.833
I gave it to him.
but he invested it in a good deal.

644
00:30:54.958 --> 00:30:56.750
Well. but well. well. well.

645
00:30:56.833 --> 00:30:58.958
- And what happened to that business?
- Broke.

646
00:30:59.041 --> 00:31:00.458
- I told you.
- When?

647
00:31:00.708 --> 00:31:05.666
One month ago. A month ago it was
six months since he went bankrupt.

648
00:31:05.791 --> 00:31:09.458
But hey. sometimes you win.
sometimes you lose.

649
00:31:09.583 --> 00:31:12.375
But how are you so calm?
I would have had him killed.

650
00:31:13.625 --> 00:31:18.083
How funny. Julia. no. when I get stressed.
do you know what I do?

651
00:31:18.208 --> 00:31:21.666
I have some fantastic pills
that make me happy.

652
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.291
Do you want? Why have a bad time.
I say. if these pills exist.

653
00:31:26.291 --> 00:31:29.375
Also. you know what?
I really. really. really.

654
00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:33.083
believe that everything
is always for the better.

655
00:31:33.166 --> 00:31:34.708

- Share screen.

How fantastic. Julia. it's the most
futuristic thing I've ever seen.

663
00:31:57.958 --> 00:32:00.916
- I feel in the Matrix.
- As you can see on his Instagram

664
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.125
he poses as a great father
who adores her daughter.

665
00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:07.958
76 percent of his posts
have to do with it.

666
00:32:08.041 --> 00:32:12.541
There are photos of trips abroad.
two in Milan. eight in Santorini.

667
00:32:12.708 --> 00:32:14.250
three in the Canaries.

668
00:32:14.375 --> 00:32:18.041
We triangulated the metadata of his photos
with the geolocation of Facebook.

669
00:32:18.125 --> 00:32:21.250
and we discovered
that the photos were taken in Chile.

670
00:32:21.375 --> 00:32:24.291
between Algarrobo and El Quisco.
very sad.

671
00:32:24.583 --> 00:32:26.625
Well. he did the same
with his girlfriend.

672
00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:29.416
this Russian model who would
never notice him. Never.

673
00:32:30.083 --> 00:32:32.250
He is so miserable
he is not even able to

674
00:32:32.375 --> 00:32:35.375
spend a dime of Clarita
on a good Photoshop.

675
00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.125
His LinkedIn shows us that
he is in charge of an investment group.

676
00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:40.791
but none of the companies
he mentions exist.

677
00:32:40.916 --> 00:32:43.416
What's more. we have not found
any bank account.

678
00:32:43.541 --> 00:32:45.833
no property in his name.

679
00:32:45.958 --> 00:32:49.041
That is. we are basically
dealing with a poor bastard.

- In tax havens?

850
00:41:37.416 --> 00:41:40.250
- He can't speak? Put him on.
- Men excite me so much

851
00:41:40.375 --> 00:41:44.125
when they are financially sound.

852
00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:45.708
Well. the other too.

853
00:41:45.791 --> 00:41:47.875
Ramírez. I know.
I know that it is terrible

854
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.541
to lose a loved one. yes.
but life is like that.

855
00:41:52.041 --> 00:41:53.041
We are nothing.

856
00:41:53.166 --> 00:41:55.708
And that to me... I don't know.

857
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.833
Things happen to me.

858
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.916
What things happen to you?

859
00:42:04.375 --> 00:42:06.541
- Stuff.
- What stuffs?

860
00:42:06.625 --> 00:42:08.041
Oh. my stomach hurt.
My God. Moon. come on.

861
00:42:08.125 --> 00:42:09.750
Where do you have the money?

862
00:42:09.875 --> 00:42:13.083
Panama?
The Greek Islands? Gibraltar?

863
00:42:14.208 --> 00:42:15.833
No. you are not understanding me.

864
00:42:15.958 --> 00:42:17.416
We have an agreement

865
00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:20.166
and if you break it. the fine
will leave us both lying in the street.

866
00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:22.333
Not just the two of us.
your family too.

867
00:42:22.583 --> 00:42:24.583
It's around. around.

868
00:42:25.541 --> 00:42:28.125
Hey. what are your wishes?

869
00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:29.916
- He is falling!
- You first.

870
00:42:30.041 --> 00:42:32.583
- No. you first.
- No. tell me how much do you earn?

871
00:42:33.583 --> 00:42:36.500
How much is in your checking account?

872
00:42:39.583 --> 00:42:41.250
[alarm ringing]
What is that?

873
00:42:41.958 --> 00:42:43.916
- What happen?
- Julia.

874
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.166
- Why is the alarm going off?
- I dont know!

875
00:42:46.291 --> 00:42:49.000
- Quiet.
- Julia. we are in an emergency.

876
00:42:49.125 --> 00:42:50.791
- Stop crying.
- You are not alone!

877
00:42:50.875 --> 00:42:52.041
Hello. Julia.
Julia. the alarm.

878
00:42:52.125 --> 00:42:54.041
To start from scratch again?

879
00:42:54.166 --> 00:42:56.541
- That's what you want?
- Mom.

880
00:42:56.666 --> 00:42:59.125
- Please watch.
- Please. a second.

881
00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:01.000
Stop crying. calm down.

882
00:43:01.125 --> 00:43:02.625
It is a dog. Ramirez.

883
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:05.666
- Julia. pick up the phone. please.
- How do you turn this off?

884
00:43:05.791 --> 00:43:07.125
- Wait.
- How do I turn it off?

885
00:43:07.208 --> 00:43:09.208
There must be a panel with numbers.

886
00:43:09.333 --> 00:43:11.750
Julia! The panel. there has to be a panel.
[rock music]

887
00:43:11.875 --> 00:43:14.916
- Look for a panel with letters
- Get up your ass.

888
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.375
- put on your jacket and to the field.
- Mom.

889
00:43:19.375 --> 00:43:23.291
- sorry my love.
- There is nothing with buttons.

890
00:43:23.375 --> 00:43:24.500
How do you turn this off?

891
00:43:24.625 --> 00:43:26.750
- Why didn't you warn me?
- I did warn you.

892
00:43:26.875 --> 00:43:31.291
- Put your seatbelt on fast. fast.
- Safe neighborhood operational. I repeat.

893
00:43:31.416 --> 00:43:33.458
safe neighborhood running!

894
00:43:33.583 --> 00:43:37.791
We have them surrounded.
Don't move. we have you surrounded.

895
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.958
What? What are you talking about?

896
00:43:40.083 --> 00:43:42.083
Party's over. criminal!

897
00:43:42.208 --> 00:43:44.458
- Oh no. that stupid. for God's sake.
- I'm not a criminal.

898
00:43:44.541 --> 00:43:46.666
- Call the police!
- I have a problem with the alarm!

899
00:43:46.791 --> 00:43:48.500
- But this is my house!
- Your house?

900
00:43:48.583 --> 00:43:50.541
Do you think I'm going to fall?
I know the owner.

901
00:43:50.666 --> 00:43:52.375
Besides. there are no immigrants
here in the neighborhood.

902
00:43:52.458 --> 00:43:53.958
- Julia!
- I am not an immigrant!

903
00:43:54.041 --> 00:43:56.291
- I am Chilean!
- She's not a foreigner. she's a brunette!

904
00:43:56.375 --> 00:43:59.291
There is no Chilean with that color.
at least here in the condo.

905
00:43:59.375 --> 00:44:01.625
Julia! Are you okay?

906
00:44:01.708 --> 00:44:04.125
- Julia. I came to defend you!
- Lock yourself in a bathroom!

907
00:44:04.208 --> 00:44:06.625
- I caught a criminal!
- Who is this guy?

908
00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:08.916
- These bastards!
- He's crazy!

909
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.708
- I'm ready!
- Julia.

910
00:44:10.833 --> 00:44:11.833
Julia!

911
00:44:11.916 --> 00:44:14.166
- Who is this guy?
- Julia. I'm here to protect you!

912
00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:17.541
- Who do you think you are?
- Shut up. you shit. back!

913
00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:21.541
Watch out. SECOM. I got him.

914
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.625
- I need help!
- I have him.

915
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:28.041
Please! Help!

916
00:44:28.166 --> 00:44:30.833
I knew this was not going to work.
Just like Mata Hari.

917
00:44:30.958 --> 00:44:32.458
[alarm sound]

918
00:44:32.791 --> 00:44:35.541
- But what are they doing?
- Sara. deactivate the alarm!

919
00:44:35.625 --> 00:44:37.916
- Deactivating alarm.
- What's going on? Leave her. man.

920
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.666
- Get out of here. go!
- Quiet.

921
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.833
- Leave her!
- Don't thank me. really.

922
00:44:42.041 --> 00:44:46.375
- Absolutely nothing was stolen.
- She's not a thief. she's my friend!

923
00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:49.708
I'm your superhero. champion.
right? He could have kill you.

924
00:44:49.833 --> 00:44:52.000
gagged you.
tied you up. scared you.

925
00:44:52.125 --> 00:44:54.083
Stop talking nonsense.
He is a boy.

926
00:44:55.708 --> 00:44:58.250
Hey. what are you doing here. too?

927
00:44:58.375 --> 00:45:01.541
I told you not to forget about me.
We already know you have money.

928
00:45:01.666 --> 00:45:03.541
- We are going to sue you.
- What money will I have?

929
00:45:03.666 --> 00:45:07.000
I was using it as a tactic
to seduce this woman.

930
00:45:07.125 --> 00:45:10.833
Because I know that all women
are only interested in money.

931
00:45:10.958 --> 00:45:14.125
- I'm leaving here.
- Get out of my house!

932
00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:16.375
- I'm going back to the nest.
- Out.

933
00:45:16.458 --> 00:45:18.000
Now. calm down.
I'm going to get you out.

934
00:45:18.083 --> 00:45:19.583
Out!

935
00:45:20.125 --> 00:45:21.333
Yes. pull hard.

936
00:45:22.375 --> 00:45:24.041
But if he said that he had money.

937
00:45:24.125 --> 00:45:25.458
No. legally it does not work.

938
00:45:25.541 --> 00:45:27.791
There is nothing specific.
It's no use.

939
00:45:27.916 --> 00:45:30.291
My God. it's Clarita.
did the ex say something to her?

940
00:45:30.375 --> 00:45:31.750
Oh. Lord.

941
00:45:31.833 --> 00:45:34.083
- Our Father who art in heaven.
- Hello everyone.

942
00:45:34.166 --> 00:45:35.458
- Hello.
- Hello.

943
00:45:35.583 --> 00:45:36.833
How are you?

944
00:45:36.958 --> 00:45:38.750
I have very good news.

945
00:45:38.875 --> 00:45:40.208
Really?

946
00:45:40.333 --> 00:45:43.583
I got the four kilos
of brown basmati rice.

947
00:45:43.708 --> 00:45:46.500
Ay. Clarita. Really.
it is not necessary.

948
00:45:48.583 --> 00:45:50.791
What is happening there behind you?

949
00:45:50.916 --> 00:45:52.875
They are seizing me.

950
00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:59.333
- React. woman. that's serious.
- No. actually it suits me.

951
00:45:59.458 --> 00:46:02.958
The thing is. some time ago
Andrés imported bracelets

952
00:46:03.041 --> 00:46:06.500
to heal rheumatism and it didn't do well.
so he had to declare bankruptcy.

953
00:46:06.583 --> 00:46:10.958
And since I am the majority member.
they came from the bank to seize me.

954
00:46:11.041 --> 00:46:15.291
What a disgusting pig!
And did you know about this bankruptcy?

955
00:46:15.541 --> 00:46:17.333
No. I just found out.

956
00:46:17.458 --> 00:46:21.458
but that's okay. so I'm going to save
a ton of money by moving south.

957
00:46:22.541 --> 00:46:24.541
Also the furniture was all old.

958
00:46:24.666 --> 00:46:26.666
They're really doing me a favor.

959
00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:28.750
Do you see that
everything happens for something?

960
00:46:28.875 --> 00:46:30.000
What move?

961
00:46:30.125 --> 00:46:34.000
Oh. they offered me work
and lodging in the South.

962
00:46:34.083 --> 00:46:36.625
- In what part of the South?
- In the South.

963
00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:40.958
The furthest south there is.
to the Chilean Antarctic.

964
00:46:41.375 --> 00:46:43.166
Look. it's beautiful.

965
00:46:43.333 --> 00:46:44.833
[blizzard]

966
00:46:45.458 --> 00:46:47.583
Hi! Ha. ha. ha.

967
00:46:47.958 --> 00:46:51.333
My godmother works in a research there.

968
00:46:51.458 --> 00:46:54.708
so they just needed
a person for repairs.

969
00:46:54.791 --> 00:46:56.583
- How incredible. isn't it?
- My God. Clarita.

970
00:46:56.708 --> 00:46:59.625
How do you think of dragging
your puppy to that wasteland?

971
00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:03.083
Oh. Trini. now with all the global warming

972
00:47:03.291 --> 00:47:05.875
it's just like 8 degrees below zero.

973
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.666
Besides. you get used to everything.

974
00:47:12.416 --> 00:47:15.125
Clarita. what are the names
of the pills you take?

975
00:47:16.375 --> 00:47:18.458
[sad music]

976
00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:27.083
Did you do your homework?

977
00:47:28.916 --> 00:47:31.250
Where are we?

978
00:47:31.375 --> 00:47:35.583
We are here.
in Santiago de Chile.

979
00:47:35.708 --> 00:47:36.958
And Antarctica?

980
00:47:38.666 --> 00:47:40.708
Antarctica is...

981
00:47:41.291 --> 00:47:43.916
it's not on this map.
but it's a bit far.

982
00:47:47.166 --> 00:47:49.875
My love. mom is going to fix this.

983
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.833
Okay? Trust me.

984
00:48:03.833 --> 00:48:06.458
I can't think of ideas anymore.

985
00:48:06.583 --> 00:48:09.708
and Clarita is so optimistic.

986
00:48:09.833 --> 00:48:13.750
I think those antidepressants she takes
are for horses.

987
00:48:15.458 --> 00:48:17.791
Pig. I don't know
if you are able to assess it.

988
00:48:18.666 --> 00:48:21.666
Her ex-husband is by far
the worst thing in life.

989
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:24.416
and now she came up with that stupid
thing about going to Antarctica.

990
00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:26.791
Explain to me.
what is she going to do there?

991
00:48:28.375 --> 00:48:32.333
Everything is so cold. and so white.
How awful.

992
00:48:33.125 --> 00:48:35.000
And it doesn't matter to her.

993
00:48:36.375 --> 00:48:38.125
Are you listening?

994
00:48:40.708 --> 00:48:44.750
You have always had a very special talent
for making yourself heard. my love.

995
00:48:46.125 --> 00:48:48.291
Whether I want it or not.

996
00:48:48.916 --> 00:48:50.708
Yes of course.

997
00:48:50.791 --> 00:48:52.125
Pig. my love.
you are absolutely right.

998
00:48:52.208 --> 00:48:55.083
I have a talent that I have not
been able to take advantage of.

999
00:48:55.166 --> 00:48:57.083
Of course.
I went to talk to Regina.

1000
00:48:57.208 --> 00:48:58.500
but I put myself there
as a school parent.

1001
00:48:58.583 --> 00:49:00.833
listening to the headmistress.
and and I didn't make myself heard.

1002
00:49:00.958 --> 00:49:02.541
I was wrong. I was wrong.

1003
00:49:02.625 --> 00:49:06.250
I was wrong about everything. because
I'm trying to solve this as a group.

1004
00:49:06.333 --> 00:49:08.625
But not all of them
have leader skills.

1005
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:11.500
I really am a steppe wolf.
a lone wolf.

1006
00:49:11.583 --> 00:49:13.458
And as the leader of the pack
what I have to do

1007
00:49:13.541 --> 00:49:16.791
is be the voice
of those who are not heard.

1008
00:49:16.916 --> 00:49:19.458
Of course. Pig.

1009
00:49:19.583 --> 00:49:21.500
I'm going back to Regina.
You're right.

1010
00:49:21.583 --> 00:49:24.750
I'm going to get my voice out
until she hears me.

1011
00:49:25.375 --> 00:49:28.916
You are so bright. really.
you are at the level of genius.

1012
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.333
Besides. my God. you're good looking.

1013
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:33.291
[intense music]

1014
00:49:43.625 --> 00:49:46.750
There's no possibility.

1015
00:49:46.833 --> 00:49:48.625
we are canceling
the Dodgeball Championship.

1016
00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:50.500
So. now it is my responsibility

1017
00:49:50.625 --> 00:49:53.458
that no mother
has the ovaries to participate?

1018
00:49:53.583 --> 00:49:57.000
Also. the lack of support
from this school is obvious.

1019
00:49:57.083 --> 00:50:00.583
Maybe if the requirements
hadn't been so difficult.

1020
00:50:00.708 --> 00:50:04.208
Being Chilean. age limit 45 years.

1021
00:50:04.333 --> 00:50:08.000
- Divorced mothers are not allowed.
- You don't understand.

1022
00:50:08.083 --> 00:50:10.416
This is not a mother's day activity

1023
00:50:10.541 --> 00:50:12.833
for the moms to get distracted.

1024
00:50:12.958 --> 00:50:15.750
This is an elite competition.

1025
00:50:16.541 --> 00:50:17.958
Good morning. Stephanie.

1026
00:50:18.208 --> 00:50:22.666
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yes. with destiny.

1027
00:50:23.333 --> 00:50:27.666
Ok. María Gracia.
get yourself one more team

1028
00:50:27.791 --> 00:50:31.291
and we will have the shortest
championship in the history of dodgeball.

1029
00:50:32.125 --> 00:50:35.666
I know. I know.

1030
00:50:35.833 --> 00:50:39.083
I am going to give an award.
[school bell]

1031
00:50:39.958 --> 00:50:43.000
of pesos to the team that wins
the Dodgeball Championship.

1032
00:50:43.083 --> 00:50:44.625
People are so materialistic

1033
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:47.708
that I bet they are going
to line up to participate.

1034
00:50:47.833 --> 00:50:49.000
Of course.

1035
00:50:49.125 --> 00:50:51.416
And we donate that money
to an institution.

1036
00:50:51.541 --> 00:50:54.041
How are we going to
donate it to an institution?

1037
00:50:54.166 --> 00:50:57.541
The idea is people to participate.

1038
00:50:58.333 --> 00:51:00.333
Can I help you with something. Trinidad?

1039
00:51:03.416 --> 00:51:06.500
- I've come to register my team.
- Hallelujah!

1040
00:51:06.625 --> 00:51:09.333
Welcome. Chubby.

1041
00:51:11.833 --> 00:51:13.708
[notifications]

1042
00:51:15.375 --> 00:51:19.291
I have gathered you here to tell you
that I have failed as a leader.

1043
00:51:19.416 --> 00:51:23.125
as president of the parents
of Fourth Grade I have failed.

1044
00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:26.791
and also as captain of the Saint
Michael School dodgeball team.

1045
00:51:26.916 --> 00:51:29.000
Yes. I have failed in this noble mission

1046
00:51:29.083 --> 00:51:30.958
we have to help our poor Clarita.

1047
00:51:31.041 --> 00:51:33.416
- What mission?
- Don't interrupt me. Clarita.

1048
00:51:33.541 --> 00:51:36.750
I have basically failed
because I have not known how to see.

1049
00:51:36.833 --> 00:51:38.500
I have not known how to take
advantage of your gifts. your talents.

1050
00:51:38.625 --> 00:51:40.166
and I have led you straight to failure.

1051
00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:42.875
To you. Moon. with that
lame Mata Hari mission.

1052
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.416
To you. Julia.
with that face to face with Andrés.

1053
00:51:45.541 --> 00:51:47.041
We both did that face to face.

1054
00:51:47.125 --> 00:51:48.458
- My Andrés?
- Don't interrupt me. Clarita.

1055
00:51:48.583 --> 00:51:50.833
- And you. Miracles. with that raffle.
- But we didn't do it.

1056
00:51:50.916 --> 00:51:53.291
For this reason.
all the doors have been closed.

1057
00:51:53.416 --> 00:51:55.958
But when a door is closed.
a window opens.

1058
00:51:56.291 --> 00:51:59.541
And now a tremendous window has opened.
because. as you well know.

1059
00:51:59.666 --> 00:52:02.541
María Gracia is organizing the Saint
Michael School Dodgeball Championship.

1060
00:52:02.666 --> 00:52:06.208
Right? Well. it turns out this year
it comes with a prize.

1061
00:52:06.333 --> 00:52:10.000
A cash prize of...
[whistle]

1062
00:52:10.083 --> 00:52:11.833
With that money
we can pay Clarita's debt.

1063
00:52:11.958 --> 00:52:13.125
Then Blanqui can continue studying

1064
00:52:13.208 --> 00:52:14.625
at school with our puppies.

1065
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:16.166
What do you think?
Good. right?

1066
00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:19.666
Today. moms. we have
a great opportunity.

1067
00:52:19.791 --> 00:52:22.458
today. here.
we have the opportunity to play.

1068
00:52:22.583 --> 00:52:24.916
to give everything.
because as our enemies say:

1069
00:52:25.125 --> 00:52:29.458
They can take our lives
but they can never take our freedom.

1070
00:52:30.375 --> 00:52:33.125
That's from Braveheart.

1071
00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:36.708
- Not at all. I came up with it.
- No possibility.

1072
00:52:36.791 --> 00:52:40.250
I swore to the Virgin that never again
in my life would I play dodgeball.

1073
00:52:40.333 --> 00:52:42.916
- You don't need to do anything.
- Don't interrupt. Clarita.

1074
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.791
Look. we have already been champions.
and with my leadership...

1075
00:52:45.916 --> 00:52:47.208
No. you are not a leader.

1076
00:52:47.333 --> 00:52:50.958
I know because I experienced it firsthand.

1077
00:52:51.041 --> 00:52:54.875
Rather. my face experienced it firsthand.

1078
00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:58.708
- What are you talking about?
- Don't interrupt me. Clarita.

1079
00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:02.833
Five years ago in this place

1080
00:53:04.833 --> 00:53:07.125
a tragedy happened.

1081
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.875
Come on. team. attentive. attentive!

1082
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.916
[dramatic music]

1083
00:53:24.541 --> 00:53:25.833
What?

1084
00:53:26.541 --> 00:53:29.833
Trinidad used me as a human shield.

1085
00:53:30.083 --> 00:53:32.666
And I had to wear a neck brace
for a year.

1086
00:53:33.041 --> 00:53:37.083
apart from having to operate my nose
because my septum opened.

1087
00:53:37.208 --> 00:53:40.791
What a liar. you never have
a deviated septum.

1088
00:53:40.916 --> 00:53:43.083
come on. you liar.
you had a big nose. that's why.

1089
00:53:43.166 --> 00:53:45.375
You didn't like your nose.
and you took the opportunity.

1090
00:53:45.458 --> 00:53:48.166
No. lie.
I couldn't breathe and I was snoring.

1091
00:53:48.291 --> 00:53:52.166
- The doctor told me about the septum.
- It was a decision of war.

1092
00:53:52.291 --> 00:53:54.583
- I was the captain.
- Do not fight.

1093
00:53:54.708 --> 00:53:57.000
I'm fine and Blanquita too.

1094
00:53:57.083 --> 00:53:59.291
The best thing is that we go
to the Chilean Antarctic.

1095
00:53:59.375 --> 00:54:02.083
Nobody is going to go to
the Chilean Antarctic. You and your Puppy

1096
00:54:02.166 --> 00:54:04.916
are going to stay here because
we are going to play for that to happen.

1097
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.500
Right?

1098
00:54:06.625 --> 00:54:08.375
- Julia?
- I'm in.

1099
00:54:10.083 --> 00:54:13.791
- Moon?
- Namaste.

1100
00:54:13.916 --> 00:54:15.500
Miracles.

1101
00:54:16.833 --> 00:54:18.333
Oh. no!

1102
00:54:18.458 --> 00:54:20.875
- What would Jesus do in your place?
- No. no.

1103
00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:23.166
What would Jesus do?

1104
00:54:23.875 --> 00:54:25.000
What would Jesus do?

1105
00:54:25.083 --> 00:54:26.833
React!

1106
00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:32.750
I can't hear you.

1107
00:54:33.708 --> 00:54:36.750
- Turn the other cheek.
- Louder!

1108
00:54:37.333 --> 00:54:38.666
Turn the other cheek!

1109
00:54:38.791 --> 00:54:40.500
So?

1110
00:54:42.208 --> 00:54:46.000
- Just for this time.
- The Power Ladies are back!

1111
00:54:48.708 --> 00:54:51.291
Yes sir. yes sir.
Power Ladies are love!

1112
00:54:51.416 --> 00:54:54.000
Loyalty. loyalty. Power Ladies are true!
Always ready. always ready!

1113
00:54:54.083 --> 00:54:55.708
Power Ladies are ready!

1114
00:54:55.833 --> 00:54:57.541
- I'm going now.
- Let's go!

1115
00:54:57.833 --> 00:55:00.125
So it's how many players per side?

1116
00:55:00.250 --> 00:55:02.000
Clarita? How many?

1117
00:55:02.208 --> 00:55:06.083
There are five players.
Exactly. Which one is eliminated?

1118
00:55:06.208 --> 00:55:08.833
Anyone who gets a ball is eliminated.

1119
00:55:08.916 --> 00:55:11.208
If the ball burns her.
that player is eliminated.

1120
00:55:11.291 --> 00:55:14.250
She goes. bye. out of the game.
who is also eliminated?

1121
00:55:14.375 --> 00:55:15.666
The person who decides to leave

1122
00:55:15.791 --> 00:55:18.083
the court during the game is eliminated.

1123
00:55:18.208 --> 00:55:21.375
So. if all of these are eliminated.

1124
00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:23.708
it means that your team disappeared.
it was eliminated.

1125
00:55:23.833 --> 00:55:27.500
and then the opposing team wins.
Is it clear to you?

1126
00:55:27.583 --> 00:55:29.458
- But I know other rules.
- What rules?

1127
00:55:29.541 --> 00:55:32.125
Listen. a person comes to the field.

1128
00:55:33.416 --> 00:55:36.416
- Right?
- She's there and throws a ball

1129
00:55:36.541 --> 00:55:39.083
- up in the air and calls a country.
- No.

1130
00:55:39.208 --> 00:55:42.083
- Then she comes...
- No. Clarita. it's not child's play.

1131
00:55:42.208 --> 00:55:44.458
That is not dodgeball. We are governed
by the official dodgeball rules.

1132
00:55:44.541 --> 00:55:46.958
we are governed by the Saint
Michael School regulations.

1133
00:55:47.041 --> 00:55:49.541
The 2017 revision.
Okay? Is that clear?

1134
00:55:49.666 --> 00:55:52.083
I am going to explain
to you with this upgrade

1135
00:55:52.208 --> 00:55:56.333
that my IT people did.
it is far more practical.

1136
00:56:03.166 --> 00:56:06.875
Miracles!
Moon with the head in the moon!

1137
00:56:07.041 --> 00:56:08.208
It was a pass. Miracles!

1138
00:56:08.333 --> 00:56:10.583
Oh. I have post-traumatic stress.

1139
00:56:10.708 --> 00:56:12.166
Positions. come on!

1140
00:56:12.291 --> 00:56:15.583
Again. attitude. attitude. come on!

1141
00:56:15.708 --> 00:56:16.916
No. he is not trained.

1142
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.000
-Johnny. fire them.
-No. no. no. me. that.

1143
00:56:20.083 --> 00:56:23.250
The opposing team is not going
to wait for you to talk on the phone.

1144
00:56:23.333 --> 00:56:25.750
Come on. come on. come on!
Let's get moving!

1145
00:56:25.875 --> 00:56:27.208
- Good.
- Here. here!

1146
00:56:28.041 --> 00:56:30.125
[whistle]

1147
00:56:33.833 --> 00:56:35.000
- Down. Good.
- Brazil!

1148
00:56:37.208 --> 00:56:39.333
Is not that game. Clarita. no!

1149
00:56:39.416 --> 00:56:41.541
I'm worried. Pig.
because I don't see them ready.

1150
00:56:41.666 --> 00:56:45.208
I see them worried about
other things. flying in the air.

1151
00:56:45.375 --> 00:56:49.333
and moreover.
Clarita does not know how to play.

1152
00:56:49.458 --> 00:56:52.875
I don't know. they are not ready. they
are not ready and I have done everything.

1153
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.625
- I've tried my best.
- Piggy. my love.

1154
00:56:56.750 --> 00:57:00.916
I'm working.
I need to focus.

1155
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.916
Right!
Of course. my love.

1156
00:57:04.041 --> 00:57:07.208
You're right.
I need a rally.

1157
00:57:07.708 --> 00:57:09.583
You're right.

1158
00:57:13.458 --> 00:57:16.250
Hello. my Power Ladies.
attentive. attentive.

1159
00:57:16.375 --> 00:57:17.583
because I need you to reserve on Friday.

1160
00:57:17.708 --> 00:57:20.375
because we are going to a rally.
just like soccer players. without puppies.

1161
00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:22.083
without husbands.
without anything. just us. focused.

1162
00:57:22.166 --> 00:57:26.500
No. no. in the end I'm not
going to be able to do it. I'm sorry.

1163
00:57:26.916 --> 00:57:30.000
It is going to be at your house.
Julia. because is the biggest.

1164
00:57:30.416 --> 00:57:33.250
Oh. and who's going to take
care of the blessings for me?

1165
00:57:33.333 --> 00:57:35.000
- My Pig.
- Hello.

1166
00:57:35.083 --> 00:57:38.166
He is happy. right? Say hi.

1167
00:57:38.291 --> 00:57:41.375
I'm going to have to send James. then.
because we all know

1168
00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:44.083
that Pig is useless with children.

1169
00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:47.125
Wonderful. so I'll take care
of the training schedule

1170
00:57:47.250 --> 00:57:48.583
and that's it.
we'll see you there on Friday.

1171
00:57:48.708 --> 00:57:50.125
- Bye.
- Bye.

1172
00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:53.750
Bye. bye. bye. bye.

1173
00:57:56.458 --> 00:57:59.916
One. two. three. four. five. three!
Come on!

1174
00:58:00.250 --> 00:58:03.833
Good. come on. come on. come on!
Clarita. Clarita!

1175
00:58:03.958 --> 00:58:07.166
We are not in the bathroom.
lower. lower. here. here!

1176
00:58:07.291 --> 00:58:08.625
Right. right. right!

1177
00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:11.416
Two. three. four. five. change!

1178
00:58:11.541 --> 00:58:14.958
Come on. more energy!
One. two. three. four. five!

1179
00:58:15.041 --> 00:58:16.666
Up

1180
00:58:17.250 --> 00:58:18.666
and up.

1181
00:58:18.791 --> 00:58:22.041
One. two. three. four. five!
Next!

1182
00:58:22.166 --> 00:58:24.125
Come on. Moon!

1183
00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:26.625
Butt cheeks down!
Butt cheeks down!

1184
00:58:26.833 --> 00:58:28.000
Come on. squats. squats!

1185
00:58:30.583 --> 00:58:32.916
Who goes? Who goes?
Go. go!

1186
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.708
- We have to try to break the record.
- No. I'm tired. it's over.

1187
00:58:35.791 --> 00:58:38.000
I'm done. We've been on this thing
for over two hours.

1188
00:58:38.083 --> 00:58:41.125
Also. it's time for my aperitif.
Sorry. a drink?

1189
00:58:41.250 --> 00:58:45.333
Sorry. but this doesn't work
if you don't listen to your captain!

1190
00:58:45.458 --> 00:58:48.208
- I have never drink.
- Mili. Mili. is going to make you great.

1191
00:58:48.333 --> 00:58:51.375
- Where are you going? Where are...?
- I never drink anything.

1192
00:58:51.625 --> 00:58:54.583
Okay. The captain decides
to take a 5 minute brake.

1193
00:58:54.750 --> 00:58:56.583
- Only five.
- Do you have a jacuzzi?

1194
00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:58.083
[uncorks]

1195
00:58:59.125 --> 00:59:02.166
- Cheers. cheers. cheers.
- This is a rally!

1196
00:59:02.333 --> 00:59:05.208
Yes. like the footballers.
I know a lot about that. Trini.

1197
00:59:05.291 --> 00:59:08.666
And be thankful that we haven't
called the stripers. or have we?

1198
00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:11.750
Because I have an ex who is a striper.
look at the photos he sends

1199
00:59:11.875 --> 00:59:15.750
-with his spectacular friends.
-No. no. let's see?

1200
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.833
No wayw.
And now we are going to confiscate

1201
00:59:18.958 --> 00:59:20.583
everything that can distract us.

1202
00:59:20.708 --> 00:59:21.833
Put your cell phones here.

1203
00:59:21.958 --> 00:59:23.541
- Absolutely right.
- It will be necessary?

1204
00:59:23.666 --> 00:59:27.166
Totally necessary. The important
thing here is that we connect.

1205
00:59:27.291 --> 00:59:28.791
Julia?

1206
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:32.875
Okay.
where my eyes see it. huh?

1207
00:59:34.041 --> 00:59:36.208
- The other one.
- Oh. you are a drag.

1208
00:59:36.333 --> 00:59:38.875
You know what?
You're right.

1209
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.666
We are not going to let
anything deconcentrate us

1210
00:59:41.875 --> 00:59:44.500
- to connect between us.
- And the sparkling wine.

1211
00:59:44.625 --> 00:59:47.375
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1212
00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:49.750
- Cheers.
- Please!

1213
00:59:49.833 --> 00:59:51.958
- We have to concentrate.
- That's where we are.

1214
00:59:52.041 --> 00:59:56.000
- I haven't had a drink in a long time.
- Yes. look. a little kiss. just a little.

1215
00:59:56.083 --> 00:59:57.416
- Just a little kiss.
- Very concentrated.

1216
00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:00.666
- So I could talk to the miss.
- The boxes come in all colors.

1217
01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:02.041
I bought it at the craft fair.

1218
01:00:02.125 --> 01:00:06.000
She colors them.
I bought her in all colors.

1219
01:00:06.083 --> 01:00:07.416
- I bought them at the craft fair.
- I talked to her.

1220
01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:09.791
- The same miss told me.
- You've been drinking for two hours.

1221
01:00:09.916 --> 01:00:12.375
Can we go back to what matters us?
Please.

1222
01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:16.541
- Relax for a while. Piggy. level up.
- No. I can't relax.

1223
01:00:16.708 --> 01:00:19.500
Because there are less
than 18 hours to play.

1224
01:00:19.625 --> 01:00:22.750
Then there is plenty of time left.
Trini. let yourself flow.

1225
01:00:22.833 --> 01:00:24.791
- A while.
- You know what? Quite the opposite.

1226
01:00:24.916 --> 01:00:27.750
Here the alcohol is going
to stop flowing now.

1227
01:00:27.875 --> 01:00:31.625
Please excuse me. it's over.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. it's over.

1228
01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:35.500
This is a concentration.
In concentrations one concentrates.

1229
01:00:35.708 --> 01:00:38.166
You know what?
You're absolutely right. Trini.

1230
01:00:38.291 --> 01:00:41.958
Let's stop drinking.
and start smoking.

1231
01:00:44.666 --> 01:00:47.541
A student paid me for his
monthly yoga classes with this.

1232
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.416
We did a super sustainable barter.

1233
01:00:50.541 --> 01:00:52.875
Hey. your yoga classes are expensive.

1234
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.375
Tell me something. is this cañabis?

1235
01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:59.375
- Cañabis?
- Cannabis. and it's sativa.

1236
01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:02.250
- Do you want?
- Over my dead boy you will consume

1237
01:01:02.375 --> 01:01:05.625
these drugs before the game.

1238
01:01:06.583 --> 01:01:08.250
Well. they are good.

1239
01:01:08.375 --> 01:01:13.208
I swear that that little girl.
the daughter of María Gracia

1240
01:01:13.333 --> 01:01:16.291
- she misalign all my chakras.
- Why?

1241
01:01:16.416 --> 01:01:20.541
- Inti doesn't even want to go to school.
- That little girl

1242
01:01:20.666 --> 01:01:22.000
needs some good leashes.

1243
01:01:22.083 --> 01:01:23.833
- I already told you.
- I don't want to be insensitive.

1244
01:01:23.916 --> 01:01:27.333
but can you leave personal problems
for another day?

1245
01:01:27.458 --> 01:01:30.208
My prince is not having
a good time either.

1246
01:01:30.333 --> 01:01:31.833
Ever since he found out
about the car theft

1247
01:01:31.958 --> 01:01:35.541
by those shitty criminals
he started to pee in bed again.

1248
01:01:35.666 --> 01:01:38.500
- My baby.
- Poor thing.

1249
01:01:38.625 --> 01:01:39.833
How awful.

1250
01:01:39.958 --> 01:01:43.083
You know?
My Juan de Dios is not well either.

1251
01:01:43.208 --> 01:01:47.541
He's like an answering machine. a rebel.
I don't know what's wrong with him.

1252
01:01:47.916 --> 01:01:51.375
- You're going to have to exorcism him.
- Yes. we were going to do it.

1253
01:01:51.458 --> 01:01:53.041
but he's too young.

1254
01:01:53.166 --> 01:01:56.708
Later. he is very small.

1255
01:01:58.166 --> 01:01:59.583
- Mili!
- Mili.

1256
01:02:00.041 --> 01:02:02.833
- In a few more years.
- Come on. Mili.

1257
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.041
But I am being serious.

1258
01:02:07.833 --> 01:02:10.708
What happens to them?
Why are you laughing? I'm seriously.

1259
01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:14.708
- Exorcisms are conducted.
- Regarding exorcisms.

1260
01:02:15.166 --> 01:02:19.125
tomorrow Father Anthony
will be the referee for the match.

1261
01:02:19.375 --> 01:02:22.250
- Yes. that's true.
- I swear I wouldn't mind at all

1262
01:02:22.375 --> 01:02:24.958
to lose myself under that cassock.

1263
01:02:25.166 --> 01:02:27.333
- Oh. what a horror!
- Moon. please.

1264
01:02:27.458 --> 01:02:31.583
- A man of faith. how do you say that.
- Jealous. you're jealous.

1265
01:02:31.791 --> 01:02:34.833
How do you think
I'm going to be jealous.

1266
01:02:35.875 --> 01:02:40.041
- Smoke one. Clarita.
- I haven't smoked for a thousand years.

1267
01:02:40.166 --> 01:02:42.250
- Why do you tell her that?
- Leave her.

1268
01:02:42.375 --> 01:02:44.750
I've actually only smoked once before.

1269
01:02:44.875 --> 01:02:47.500
Yeah. but just this once
I'm going to try it.

1270
01:02:47.708 --> 01:02:49.416
- Smoke one.
- But hey. Clarita.

1271
01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:51.458
It's not good. your neurons
are going to die. Really.

1272
01:02:51.541 --> 01:02:53.333
- Smoke. smoke. smoke.
- Let's do it.

1273
01:02:53.791 --> 01:02:56.708
[doorbell]
Little. little.

1274
01:02:57.333 --> 01:02:59.125
That. very good.
[doorbell]

1275
01:02:59.333 --> 01:03:01.375
- Why do you do it like that?
- James!

1276
01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:05.500
How unworthy. I'm going to open my self.

1277
01:03:08.333 --> 01:03:09.625
Is this the guy?

1278
01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:11.291
Yes. he is completely insane.

1279
01:03:12.250 --> 01:03:15.083
Julia. I don't understand
the laughter or your negligence.

1280
01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:17.041
why aren't you connecting
to Super Safe Neighbors?

1281
01:03:17.166 --> 01:03:20.333
Super Safe Neighbors. I'm super busy.

1282
01:03:20.458 --> 01:03:21.958
The same
we all the neighbors ask ourselves

1283
01:03:22.041 --> 01:03:23.583
- listening to this music at this party.
- What party?

1284
01:03:23.708 --> 01:03:26.666
- I am with my friends.
- Friends?

1285
01:03:26.791 --> 01:03:31.208
Are they registered? Do you have
the names? Are they Chilean. foreign?

1286
01:03:31.333 --> 01:03:32.833
Legal?

1287
01:03:33.916 --> 01:03:36.166
Ah. now I understand.
using illicit drugs.

1288
01:03:36.291 --> 01:03:38.916
Oh. a little bit of weed. that's all.

1289
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
I meet you again.

1290
01:03:41.125 --> 01:03:43.541
This is unacceptable. Julia.
the neighbors do not accept this.

1291
01:03:43.666 --> 01:03:46.458
If you continue. I'm going
to have to call the police.

1292
01:03:46.583 --> 01:03:47.666
Hey. hey.

1293
01:03:47.791 --> 01:03:51.333
I haven't smoked anything.
I just had a glass of champagne.

1294
01:03:51.458 --> 01:03:54.416
I am quietly
on my private property.

1295
01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:57.791
But we are in a republic. with rules
and regulations that we must obey.

1296
01:03:57.916 --> 01:03:59.791
a Constitution
that must be loved and defended.

1297
01:03:59.916 --> 01:04:02.375
If you continue like this.
I'm going to have to report you

1298
01:04:02.458 --> 01:04:05.000
unfortunately
to Super Safe Neighbors.

1299
01:04:05.208 --> 01:04:06.833
Report me wherever you want.

1300
01:04:06.958 --> 01:04:10.416
you have me like this.
like this swollen ovaries

1301
01:04:10.541 --> 01:04:13.791
with your fucking app
full of fascists.

1302
01:04:13.916 --> 01:04:17.916
Live and let live.
Get out of my house. fuck off.

1303
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.125
- I'm leaving. but you're lost.
- Yes. yes!

1304
01:04:20.208 --> 01:04:22.166
- because no one is above the law. Nobody.
- Yes. yes!

1305
01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:23.833
I am to respect the law.

1306
01:04:24.250 --> 01:04:25.750
No one is outside!

1307
01:04:28.208 --> 01:04:30.875
- Smoke. smoke. smoke. smoke.
- No. no. no!

1308
01:04:31.083 --> 01:04:33.833
- Mili. it's a little weed.
- No. no.

1309
01:04:33.916 --> 01:04:36.333
God wouldn't have created it
if He didn't want you to try it.

1310
01:04:36.416 --> 01:04:41.083
No! A vice president
would never use illegal drugs.

1311
01:04:42.541 --> 01:04:45.541
Treasurer.
Come over here.

1312
01:04:46.416 --> 01:04:48.041
Good. Mill.

1313
01:04:48.166 --> 01:04:52.083
Good. very good.

1314
01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:59.958
Tequila!

1315
01:05:00.166 --> 01:05:03.750

1320

[piano music]

1322
01:06:28.458 --> 01:06:31.875
It is like a miracle.

1323
01:06:33.166 --> 01:06:35.250
My whole life

1324
01:06:36.208 --> 01:06:39.791
It lighted up.

1325
01:06:40.166 --> 01:06:44.125
You. you are my lighthouse.

1326
01:06:44.916 --> 01:06:46.833
You bring me light.

1327
01:06:47.541 --> 01:06:52.166
You are my God.

1328
01:06:52.625 --> 01:06:56.166
I feel that my soul

1329
01:06:57.250 --> 01:06:58.833
is rising up

1330
01:06:59.041 --> 01:07:02.083
and flies to you.

1331
01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:05.666
Flies to you.

1332
01:07:07.666 --> 01:07:09.625
Hallelujah. hallelujah.

1333
01:07:10.375 --> 01:07:12.208
hallelujah. oh my God.

1334
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.916
It's like a miracle

my whole life

1336
01:07:19.708 --> 01:07:22.041
It lighted up.

1337
01:07:25.208 --> 01:07:26.958
you are my lighthouse.

1338
01:07:27.833 --> 01:07:29.625
you bring me light.

1339
01:07:30.208 --> 01:07:32.583
you are my God.

1340
01:07:34.541 --> 01:07:37.958
I feel that my soul

1341
01:07:38.791 --> 01:07:40.916
is rising up

1342
01:07:41.125 --> 01:07:43.083
and flies to you.

1343
01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:48.583
you are the reason

1344
01:07:49.916 --> 01:07:53.916
for which I sing this song.

1345
01:07:54.208 --> 01:07:58.875
Hallelujah. hallelujah. hallelujah.
oh my god.

1346
01:07:59.333 --> 01:08:03.958
Hallelujah. hallelujah. hallelujah.
my Lord.

1347
01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:09.666
Hallelujah. hallelujah. hallelujah.
oh my God.

1348
01:08:10.291 --> 01:08:15.291
Hallelujah. hallelujah. hallelujah.
my Lord.

1349
01:08:15.875 --> 01:08:20.791
Hallelujah. hallelujah. hallelujah.
oh my Lord.

1350
01:08:20.958 --> 01:08:25.750
Hallelujah. hallelujah.
the miracle of love.

1351
01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:30.208
Miracles. Miracles.

1352
01:08:31.583 --> 01:08:34.500
Miracles. Miracles.

1353
01:08:35.875 --> 01:08:40.125
Miracles. Miracles.

1354
01:08:40.291 --> 01:08:42.708
Miracles!

1355
01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.500
Well. well. hallelujah.
hallelujah. you woke up.

1356
01:08:45.583 --> 01:08:48.000
I swear to you. what a horror.
you came back. Miracles.

1357
01:08:48.083 --> 01:08:50.958
you have to walk a bit
to get your blood circulating.

1358
01:08:51.125 --> 01:08:53.125
[doorbell]
James!

1359
01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:57.000
- Clarita. press. open the gate.
- You were completely unconscious.

1360
01:08:57.125 --> 01:08:59.500
Don't be filthy.

1361
01:08:59.625 --> 01:09:02.250
I would throw you into the pool.
but you would drown.

1362
01:09:02.375 --> 01:09:04.041
I'm going to put you
in a cold tub.

1363
01:09:04.125 --> 01:09:05.166
Right. to the water.

1364
01:09:05.291 --> 01:09:07.291
No. no. not to the pool.
not because you're going to drown.

1365
01:09:07.375 --> 01:09:11.083
- you are totally and absolutely stoned.
- Let her bathe for a while.

1366
01:09:11.208 --> 01:09:12.458
Good afternoon. ladies.

1367
01:09:12.583 --> 01:09:14.083
- Hello.
- Good afternoon.

1368
01:09:14.625 --> 01:09:15.875
- React. Mili.
- Traitor.

1369
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.416
- We have the information
- That's right.

1370
01:09:17.541 --> 01:09:21.000
that illegal substances
were being consumed.

1371
01:09:21.083 --> 01:09:23.750
No. we are not consuming
absolutely anything here.

1372
01:09:23.833 --> 01:09:25.791
- What's the matter?
- Captain. my captain.

1373
01:09:25.916 --> 01:09:27.333
actually that's the dealer.

1374
01:09:27.458 --> 01:09:29.041
Where did you get that from. miss?

1375
01:09:29.125 --> 01:09:33.416
I appreciate you enthusiasm.
Sub Lieutenant. but I'm asking questions.

1376
01:09:34.041 --> 01:09:36.583
- Where did you get that from?
- Sergeant. Sergeant.

1377
01:09:36.666 --> 01:09:38.416
Captain. please.

1378
01:09:38.625 --> 01:09:41.375
Well. captain.
I don't have to give you an explanation

1379
01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:44.500
of what happens on my private property.
it's my house.

1380
01:09:44.583 --> 01:09:46.291
- my friends.
- Calm down. excuse me.

1381
01:09:46.416 --> 01:09:47.875
- My pool.
- Sorry. you said captain?

1382
01:09:47.958 --> 01:09:50.000
- That's right.
- I am also a captain.

1383
01:09:50.083 --> 01:09:53.250
I am captain of the Saint
Michael School Dodgeball Team.

1384
01:09:53.375 --> 01:09:55.083
Trinidad Goycochea.

1385
01:09:55.208 --> 01:09:57.500
Well.

1386
01:09:57.625 --> 01:09:59.250
I comment.
from captain to captain

1387
01:09:59.708 --> 01:10:02.666
this is all a huge and
utter misunderstanding.

1388
01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:04.291
My captain.
there is no misunderstanding.

1389
01:10:04.375 --> 01:10:07.583
I have surprised them
doing international transactions.

1390
01:10:07.666 --> 01:10:10.333
And if you observe. the brunette
has introduced drugs to the country.

1391
01:10:10.458 --> 01:10:12.916
- surely in her body.
- That is not true.

1392
01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.916
Is it cannabis you were consuming?

1393
01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.000
- No. no. it's noodles. Do you want?
- Right.

1394
01:10:18.125 --> 01:10:19.791
- I overcooked them.
- Right.

1395
01:10:19.916 --> 01:10:22.458
Let's see. let's see. let's see.
a little bit of order. ladies. please.

1396
01:10:22.541 --> 01:10:25.458
- Officer. please stay out of it.
- Sorry. Captain.

1397
01:10:27.291 --> 01:10:29.291
Let's see. ladies. first thing.

1398
01:10:29.416 --> 01:10:32.083
whose cannabis is it?

1399
01:10:32.208 --> 01:10:33.750
From you?

1400
01:10:35.416 --> 01:10:36.916
Mine.

1401
01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:40.416
From the universe.
from the pacha mama.

1402
01:10:41.625 --> 01:10:44.833
I repeat the question to you. ladies.

1403
01:10:45.125 --> 01:10:47.916
Whose cannabis is it?

1404
01:10:49.625 --> 01:10:52.333
Oh. why did she look ugly at me?

1405
01:10:53.041 --> 01:10:57.708
I smoked just once.
I did it to belong to the group.

1406
01:10:58.083 --> 01:11:01.833
to integrate.
to be part of something.

1407
01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:09.416
Order. ladies. please. please.

1408
01:11:09.541 --> 01:11:12.791
That amount exceeds what
is established by law 20.000.

1409
01:11:14.583 --> 01:11:18.791
which confirms that you would be
committing a very serious offense.

1410
01:11:19.833 --> 01:11:24.708
I repeat the question to you.
for the last time. whose cannabis is it?

1411
01:11:27.958 --> 01:11:30.416
- Cannabis?
- Well well.

1412
01:11:36.708 --> 01:11:39.750
It belongs to no one. Captain.

1413
01:11:41.875 --> 01:11:45.666
Well. then if it's nobody's.
it's everybody's. what do you think?

1414
01:11:46.583 --> 01:11:47.833
Wrong.

1415
01:11:47.958 --> 01:11:51.666
You are going to have to accompany us to
the police station to decide whose it is.

1416
01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:53.041
No. no. no.

1417
01:11:53.125 --> 01:11:55.666
- I am very clear about my rights.
- That's right. ma'am.

1418
01:11:55.791 --> 01:11:57.250
Your right is to remain silent.

1419
01:11:57.333 --> 01:11:59.916
- Come with us. please.
- No. no.

1420
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.250
- This is a misunderstanding.
- Ma'am. please.

1421
01:12:02.375 --> 01:12:05.000
This is a misunderstanding
and we are not moving from here!

1422
01:12:05.083 --> 01:12:07.666
Julia. please reconsider!

1423
01:12:08.208 --> 01:12:09.958
You are a disgrace to a PLU.

1424
01:12:11.958 --> 01:12:13.666
You are a low life.

1425
01:12:14.875 --> 01:12:16.208
Think. you shit!

1426
01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.750
[notifications]

1427
01:12:21.583 --> 01:12:25.125
How can you not realize that this is
a total and utter misunderstanding?

1428
01:12:25.208 --> 01:12:28.625
We are being treated like
criminals. What happened?

1429
01:12:28.750 --> 01:12:31.250
Are the codes between captains
no longer respected?

1430
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.541
They took everything from us.
why did they take the laces off us?

1431
01:12:36.833 --> 01:12:39.500
What use are laces for us?

1432
01:12:39.625 --> 01:12:41.625
It is in order not to commit suicide.

1433
01:12:42.166 --> 01:12:44.541
I saw that at Airport Alarm.
They take everything

1434
01:12:44.666 --> 01:12:47.666
and then to the dungeon.

1435
01:12:48.041 --> 01:12:49.416
It's morning.

1436
01:12:50.291 --> 01:12:53.708
We have a priority activity
at the puppie's school.

1437
01:12:53.791 --> 01:12:55.875
We need have to be playing a match
right now. do you understand me?

1438
01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.333
So. get us out of here now.

1439
01:12:58.416 --> 01:13:00.750
Easy. easy. easy.
Calm down.

1440
01:13:00.833 --> 01:13:03.833
I already told you. as long as you
do not agree on who is the owner

1441
01:13:03.958 --> 01:13:08.083
of the cannabis. you are going
to continue here. are we clear?

1442
01:13:10.416 --> 01:13:13.208
And could you at least tell me
what the time is. Captain?

1443
01:13:13.291 --> 01:13:16.541
Of course.
8 with 30 minutes. Captain.

1444
01:13:17.625 --> 01:13:20.166
30. no.
we are running out of time.

1445
01:13:20.833 --> 01:13:23.291
Do you realize that they
haven't even been kind to

1446
01:13:23.375 --> 01:13:25.250
let us take out our cell phones?
How awful.

1447
01:13:25.375 --> 01:13:27.250
- Listen.
- No cell phones. no lawyers.

1448
01:13:27.333 --> 01:13:29.541
- and without them. we don't get out.
- Can I suggest something?

1449
01:13:29.625 --> 01:13:31.541
The bad news is that we don't
know any number by heart.

1450
01:13:31.666 --> 01:13:34.958
Imagine having to call
someone in these conditions.

1451
01:13:35.041 --> 01:13:37.708
- It's a good idea.
- Who are you going to call. Mili?

1452
01:13:37.791 --> 01:13:39.541
- Also. do you know someone?
- It could work.

1453
01:13:39.625 --> 01:13:42.375
My Pig must be totally crazy
without me. desperate.

1454
01:13:42.458 --> 01:13:44.333
without knowing where I am.
totally lost

1455
01:13:44.416 --> 01:13:48.375
-thinking of his Piggy.
- Listen to me!

1456
01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:53.541
Please!

1457
01:14:12.125 --> 01:14:13.750
Yeah. right. right. James.

1458
01:14:13.875 --> 01:14:15.375
Thank you.

1459
01:14:25.916 --> 01:14:29.750
They're a little bit late. right?

1460
01:14:37.666 --> 01:14:40.250
So. the only thing we have to do

1461
01:14:40.375 --> 01:14:44.333
- is to say marijuana belongs to everyone.
- Marijuana belongs to everyone.

1462
01:14:44.458 --> 01:14:48.708
- I mean. it belongs to all of us.
- What are you talking about? Please.

1463
01:14:48.833 --> 01:14:52.666
Look. I calculate that what was
in the bag was like 20 grams or so.

1464
01:14:52.791 --> 01:14:54.458
If we divide it between us five.

1465
01:14:54.583 --> 01:14:56.583
would be like four grams per person.

1466
01:14:56.708 --> 01:14:59.708
- and that is personal consumption.
- Yes.

1467
01:14:59.791 --> 01:15:01.291
Where do you get those things from?

1468
01:15:01.375 --> 01:15:03.708
Airport Alarm.
It is highly educational.

1469
01:15:03.791 --> 01:15:06.250
And what about the education
we are giving to our puppies?

1470
01:15:06.333 --> 01:15:08.875
I wonder what happens
with the example?

1471
01:15:08.958 --> 01:15:12.000
I also imagine that everyone is very
clear that I had nothing to do with this.

1472
01:15:12.083 --> 01:15:14.916
If they find out in the parish
they can excommunicate me.

1473
01:15:15.083 --> 01:15:17.625
And with good reason.
because you are a drug addict.

1474
01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:21.708
I have a reputation to take care of.
I cannot appear stamped on a meme.

1475
01:15:21.875 --> 01:15:25.000
Now. if you don't want to do it.
that's fine.

1476
01:15:25.083 --> 01:15:28.083
it shouldn't be easy for you
to say something like that.

1477
01:15:30.083 --> 01:15:32.333
I'm going to blame myself
for all of you.

1478
01:15:32.458 --> 01:15:36.333
- Finally. well. Clarita.
- No.

1479
01:15:36.458 --> 01:15:39.458
If anyone is guilty here.
it is me.

1480
01:15:39.583 --> 01:15:43.000
Even if I don't believe that word: guilt.
Okay. okay. I'm going

1481
01:15:43.125 --> 01:15:45.833
to say that the marijuana is mine
and you see if you can play.

1482
01:15:45.958 --> 01:15:48.916
- Right.
- No. Moon. Of course not.

1483
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.458
Absolutely not.

1484
01:15:50.583 --> 01:15:52.875
Because the only way we have
to win this match

1485
01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.916
is all together. Yes.

1486
01:15:57.958 --> 01:16:00.916
Can you imagine.
one of you suddenly

1487
01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.875
decides to cross the desert alone.

1488
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.958
her soul there.
at the mercy of the sandstorms.

1489
01:16:07.041 --> 01:16:10.750
at the mercy of the abyss. the heat.
the thirst. what would happen?

1490
01:16:10.875 --> 01:16:13.166
You would get nowhere.
And do you know why?

1491
01:16:13.291 --> 01:16:16.416
Because the desert is crossed
by caravan.

1492
01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:18.458
- Did you smoke one in the morning?
- No.

1493
01:16:18.541 --> 01:16:22.333
And if you are willing
to self-incriminate and so are you.

1494
01:16:23.083 --> 01:16:26.125
well. OK. no more talk. me too.

1495
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.500
You. Julia?

1496
01:16:29.916 --> 01:16:31.416
I am in.

1497
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.750
You?

1498
01:16:34.750 --> 01:16:36.375
The thing is...

1499
01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.708
The...

1500
01:16:38.833 --> 01:16:40.500
What would Jesus do?

1501
01:16:41.291 --> 01:16:44.333
Yes. yes. yes.

1502
01:16:44.458 --> 01:16:45.625
Okay?

1503
01:16:45.791 --> 01:16:46.875
Yes. Caravan.

1504
01:16:48.250 --> 01:16:49.583
Captain!

1505
01:16:50.833 --> 01:16:52.083
Caravan.

1506
01:16:53.666 --> 01:16:55.916
According
to the Official Dodgeball Rules

1507
01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.125
of the Saint Michael School.
revision of June 2017.

1508
01:16:59.250 --> 01:17:02.666
after 20 minutes. the team
that does not get to the court

1509
01:17:02.750 --> 01:17:04.375
will be
automatically eliminated.

1510
01:17:04.458 --> 01:17:08.458
what would be giving us

There's no need.

1669
01:27:35.833 --> 01:27:36.958
But it is true.

1670
01:27:37.083 --> 01:27:39.708

01:28:00.041 --> 01:28:01.916
- Take it easy.
- I would be angry too

1681
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.625
if my son couldn't defend
himself from a little girl.

1682
01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:06.541
Sorry. sorry. We are not going to bring
the puppies into this discussion. okay?

1683
01:28:06.625 --> 01:28:08.875
Daughter. I have a daughter.
because as far as I know.

1684
01:28:08.958 --> 01:28:12.000
the only ones
that have puppies are bitches.

1685
01:28:13.416 --> 01:28:17.375
- Kill her.
- No. no. no!

1686
01:28:19.541 --> 01:28:21.041
Split.

1687
01:28:23.875 --> 01:28:25.000
Let go.

1688
01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:30.916
Miracles. are you all right?
How do you feel?

1689
01:28:32.666 --> 01:28:34.333
In heaven.

1690
01:28:39.375 --> 01:28:40.958
- Let go.
- Now.

1691
01:28:42.875 --> 01:28:44.625
Watch out.

1692
01:28:45.583 --> 01:28:47.291
Get off me!

1693
01:28:57.166 --> 01:28:58.333
Leave her!

1694
01:28:58.791 --> 01:29:00.375
- Let go.
- No. you let go.

1695
01:29:01.083 --> 01:29:03.333
Oh. it hurts!

1696
01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:06.333
My nails.
I did them today.

1697
01:29:06.916 --> 01:29:10.375
- Damn you.
- Let go of my foot! Let go!

1698
01:29:10.625 --> 01:29:13.208
Oh. let go of me. crazy.
let go of me!

1699
01:29:13.333 --> 01:29:14.916
Let go!

1700
01:29:15.333 --> 01:29:18.166
- Crazy. you scratched me!
- Take this. crazy!

1701
01:29:18.416 --> 01:29:20.458
- Get off!
- Take it!

1702
01:29:20.666 --> 01:29:23.291
- Take it!
- My braid!

1703
01:29:23.791 --> 01:29:25.291
Let go!

1704
01:29:26.375 --> 01:29:30.416
- Here I have signal.
- Oh. the landscape is beautiful.

1705
01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:32.708
- You'll love it here.
- The weather is good there.

1706
01:29:32.791 --> 01:29:34.166
Oh. yes. it's hot.

1707
01:29:34.291 --> 01:29:36.958
- In five more days I will be there.
- It will be soon.

1708
01:29:37.041 --> 01:29:40.250
- Thank you. godmother for this.
- You're welcome. my girl.

1709
01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:43.500
- Blanquita. look at the penguin.
- That's Mauri. Mauri come!

1710
01:29:44.125 --> 01:29:45.541
What's wrong with the child?

1711
01:29:47.208 --> 01:29:49.333
At this time she is already tired.

1712
01:29:49.541 --> 01:29:52.250
- What happened to your face?
No. nothing. I tripped.

1713
01:29:52.416 --> 01:29:53.791
No. you must apply cream.

1714
01:29:53.916 --> 01:29:57.000
Oh. my little Buddha.
I didn't give you a good example.

1715
01:29:58.208 --> 01:30:00.958
But sometimes we moms
make mistakes too.

1716
01:30:01.041 --> 01:30:04.000
Yes. but thanks to your war

1717
01:30:04.125 --> 01:30:06.541
I found my peace.

1718
01:30:07.166 --> 01:30:09.000
- And you know what?
- What?

1719
01:30:09.208 --> 01:30:11.791
I learned that Greta is not bad.

1720
01:30:11.916 --> 01:30:14.083
She is fragile. like me.

1721
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.875
My warrior. you are so wise. my love.

1722
01:30:18.375 --> 01:30:19.875
Mom?

1723
01:30:21.291 --> 01:30:24.000
Mom. I think I like her.

1724
01:30:24.666 --> 01:30:26.166
No.

1725
01:30:26.416 --> 01:30:29.666
Sometimes
the heart is confused. my love.

1726
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:31.333
You do not like her.

1727
01:30:32.416 --> 01:30:35.416
There. good. my love.

1728
01:30:35.541 --> 01:30:37.000
Pupi.

1729
01:30:37.916 --> 01:30:39.208
good night.

1730
01:30:39.958 --> 01:30:41.625
Sleep well.

1731
01:30:42.125 --> 01:30:44.458
I'm proud of you.

1732
01:30:44.625 --> 01:30:46.583
Of me? Why?

1733
01:30:47.541 --> 01:30:50.166
Because you played as a team.

1734
01:30:51.458 --> 01:30:54.000
and it is better to lose together
than to win alone.

1735
01:31:12.666 --> 01:31:16.333
- Mom.
- I'm working. my love.

1736
01:31:16.625 --> 01:31:18.416
Why did you change your pajamas?

1737
01:31:18.541 --> 01:31:21.000
I just peed.

1738
01:31:21.958 --> 01:31:23.916
Why?

1739
01:31:24.083 --> 01:31:25.958
I'm afraid.

1740
01:31:26.041 --> 01:31:27.125
About what?

1741
01:31:27.250 --> 01:31:30.750
There is a camera in the bathroom.
what if I meet a thief?

1742
01:31:40.583 --> 01:31:42.125
It's over.

1743
01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.583
Thanks. Mom.

1744
01:31:44.833 --> 01:31:47.541
- Why. my love?
- For listening.

1745
01:31:51.791 --> 01:31:53.208
I love you.

1746
01:31:53.333 --> 01:31:54.833
Me too.

1747
01:32:02.083 --> 01:32:03.583
Mom?

1748
01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:07.333
And your friends?

1749
01:32:08.708 --> 01:32:10.500
They couldn't come.

1750
01:32:11.791 --> 01:32:13.541
Does it hurt a lot?

1751
01:32:13.791 --> 01:32:17.041
No. a little bit.
but it doesn't matter.

1752
01:32:17.166 --> 01:32:19.666
The important thing is that we win.

1753
01:32:20.250 --> 01:32:23.208
And what is the use of winning
if we are always alone?

1754
01:32:34.625 --> 01:32:36.750
Obviously it was not
the right way to react.

1755
01:32:36.833 --> 01:32:39.625
but you also have to understand.
Regina. that we were under a lot of stress

1756
01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:41.750
because we needed the cash.

1757
01:32:41.875 --> 01:32:44.041
so that Blanqui
did not have to leave school.

1758
01:32:44.625 --> 01:32:46.333
There is no justification.

1759
01:32:48.208 --> 01:32:49.791
There isn't.

1760
01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.958
And we are going to talk later.
father Anthony.

1761
01:32:55.041 --> 01:32:57.125
Look. I think the most sensible thing

1762
01:32:57.291 --> 01:33:00.375
is for Clara to leave our community.

1763
01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:03.250
For her to give the space
to someone who can pay for it.

1764
01:33:03.375 --> 01:33:05.291
-She is right.
- Of course I'm right.

1765
01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:08.000
Also. I'm going to tell you
that very soon

1766
01:33:08.125 --> 01:33:10.916
- the monthly fee is going to rise.
- Again?

1767
01:33:13.458 --> 01:33:15.000
How can it rise again?

1768
01:33:15.125 --> 01:33:18.333
We are going to talk on
the second semester. Okay. Trinidad?

1769
01:33:18.458 --> 01:33:20.125
I can't wait until next semester.

1770
01:33:20.250 --> 01:33:21.500
I have no time.
Let's talk now.

1771
01:33:21.583 --> 01:33:24.750
- We are not money-making machines.
- Well. I am.

1772
01:33:24.875 --> 01:33:27.458
I have all my blessings in this college.

1773
01:33:27.583 --> 01:33:30.500
- This is a Catholic school.
- Let's see.

1774
01:33:30.625 --> 01:33:32.166
What I cannot understand

1775
01:33:32.291 --> 01:33:34.166
is how you can have your children

1776
01:33:34.291 --> 01:33:37.333
in a school with this level of values
and not wanting to pay for it.

1777
01:33:37.416 --> 01:33:38.875
It's not about that. Regina.

1778
01:33:39.666 --> 01:33:45.458
[indistinct conversations]

1779
01:33:49.125 --> 01:33:51.791
Let them go to a school without values.
it is cheaper.

1780
01:33:51.875 --> 01:33:54.250
Discounts cannot be made.

1781
01:33:58.083 --> 01:34:00.625
Values have a cost.

1782
01:34:01.958 --> 01:34:04.166
A school without values is cheaper.

1783
01:34:04.375 --> 01:34:05.500
It's that simple.

1784
01:34:05.625 --> 01:34:08.916
Moms. silence. silence.

1785
01:34:12.791 --> 01:34:14.125
Silence!

1786
01:34:16.958 --> 01:34:20.000
If our beloved Saint Michael School
decided to take this path.

1787
01:34:20.125 --> 01:34:22.375
know that I will not follow it.

1788
01:34:22.583 --> 01:34:27.083
my puppy is leaving
this school right now.

1789
01:34:28.541 --> 01:34:31.916
The best education
I will give it by example.

1790
01:34:32.166 --> 01:34:35.125
Trinidad. please.
let's not get dramatic.

1791
01:34:36.791 --> 01:34:38.166
My Dante is leaving too.

1792
01:34:38.916 --> 01:34:42.833
The best education
I will give it by example.

1793
01:34:45.583 --> 01:34:48.458
My little Buddha doesn't deserve
this negative energy.

1794
01:34:48.583 --> 01:34:51.000
The best education
I will give it by example.

1795
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:57.666
I and all my blessings. which are not few.
we are leaving school.

1796
01:34:58.083 --> 01:35:00.541
The best education
I will give it by example.

1797
01:35:01.166 --> 01:35:02.916
Me too.

1798
01:35:03.583 --> 01:35:07.750
The best education
I will give it by example.

1799
01:35:07.875 --> 01:35:10.500
I still couldn't afford to pay for school.

1800
01:35:11.041 --> 01:35:13.666
Let's talk about this
in a more civilized way.

1801
01:35:13.791 --> 01:35:17.708
Let's get off the table. please.

1802
01:35:19.083 --> 01:35:22.250
Regina. Regina. stop it. really.

1803
01:35:22.375 --> 01:35:25.208
And you. how are you not ashamed?

1804
01:35:25.333 --> 01:35:28.125
Pretend that they give them
the education of their children for free.

1805
01:35:28.208 --> 01:35:29.708
Frankly.

1806
01:35:30.750 --> 01:35:32.375
Please.

1807
01:35:36.583 --> 01:35:39.625
It is not so easy for me
to pay for this college either.

1808
01:35:40.125 --> 01:35:41.625
I'm going.

1809
01:35:42.041 --> 01:35:44.250
The best education
I will give it by example.

1810
01:35:44.333 --> 01:35:48.208
But it is not necessary.

1811
01:35:49.541 --> 01:35:51.833
The best education
I will give it by example.

1812
01:35:52.875 --> 01:35:57.375
- The education I will give it by example.
- The education I will give it by example.

1813
01:35:57.583 --> 01:35:58.625
Wait. please.

1814
01:36:01.083 --> 01:36:04.083
- Father Anthony!
- It is very moving.

1815
01:36:04.458 --> 01:36:07.791
I thank you.
I thank you María Gracia. really.

1816
01:36:07.916 --> 01:36:12.791
for being the only
sensible one in this group.

1817
01:36:13.125 --> 01:36:16.916
What do the rest need to stay?

1818
01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:19.458
That a grant be created.

1819
01:36:20.041 --> 01:36:24.083
No possibility.

1820
01:36:26.666 --> 01:36:28.166
Why not?

1821
01:36:30.958 --> 01:36:32.958
The budget is not enough this year.

1822
01:36:35.291 --> 01:36:38.291
And what is the use of winning
if we are always alone?

1823
01:36:40.750 --> 01:36:43.208
Do we do our part
or do we not do our part?

1824
01:36:54.375 --> 01:36:56.208
The budget is not enough this year.

1825
01:37:04.416 --> 01:37:06.250
They are right.

1826
01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:10.083
I'm going to take Greta
out of school too.

1827
01:37:10.208 --> 01:37:12.166
But María Gracia.

1828
01:37:12.291 --> 01:37:14.875
about the grant.
there really is no possibility.

1829
01:37:18.958 --> 01:37:21.833
Unless we donated the prize

1830
01:37:21.958 --> 01:37:24.625
- of the Dodgeball Championship.
- Of course.

1831
01:37:24.750 --> 01:37:28.166
To create the grant
for the remainder of the year.

1832
01:37:29.375 --> 01:37:32.000
Well. that changes a lot the situation.

1833
01:37:32.125 --> 01:37:35.083
Sure. it's different.

1834
01:37:35.208 --> 01:37:36.958
And what about next year?

1835
01:37:37.041 --> 01:37:39.083
Well. the college would have to commit

1836
01:37:39.166 --> 01:37:42.833
to create a real grant for the future

1837
01:37:42.916 --> 01:37:44.625
and not only for Clarita.

1838
01:37:44.916 --> 01:37:47.708
but for all the families that need it.

1839
01:37:47.791 --> 01:37:49.958
No. that is impossible. no way.

1840
01:37:50.041 --> 01:37:51.833
It's possible!

1841
01:37:51.958 --> 01:37:55.083
Yes. if the school marginalizes
30 percent and not 35 percent

1842
01:37:55.375 --> 01:37:57.041
is enough and it balances.

1843
01:37:57.958 --> 01:38:01.000
I could manage
the grant committee.

1844
01:38:02.375 --> 01:38:06.125
I offer myself to be
the vice president of that committee.

1845
01:38:06.250 --> 01:38:08.916
I think we would need more
of a treasurer.

1846
01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.541
- Vice President.
- Is the same.

1847
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:13.166
Is not the same.

1848
01:38:13.625 --> 01:38:16.916
You know what? Is not the same.

1849
01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.333
Wait. wait.
Okay. listen to me.

1850
01:38:20.291 --> 01:38:23.916
- Approved. you have your grant.
- Yes!

1851
01:38:24.333 --> 01:38:29.291
[emotional music]

1852
01:38:37.041 --> 01:38:39.875
It's better to lose together

1853
01:38:42.916 --> 01:38:45.000
that... oh!

1854
01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:47.958
Are you okay?

1855
01:38:49.416 --> 01:38:50.666
- How awful.
- Shit!

1856
01:38:50.875 --> 01:38:52.291
- Are you okay?
- How awful.

1857
01:38:53.250 --> 01:38:56.375
- It was a horrible fall.
- Don't move her. don't move her.

1858
01:38:56.500 --> 01:38:57.500
Careful.

1859
01:38:57.583 --> 01:39:01.375
It is outrageous that you want to raise
the price if the school is falling apart.

1860
01:39:01.458 --> 01:39:04.375
There is much. much to fix.
Many things need to be repaired.

1861
01:39:04.458 --> 01:39:06.125
These are only details. careful.

1862
01:39:06.250 --> 01:39:10.666
You would need to hire
a person to do that job.

1863
01:39:11.458 --> 01:39:13.708
Right.

1864
01:39:13.833 --> 01:39:17.041
Someone who is good. enterprising.

1865
01:39:17.458 --> 01:39:19.083
and close with the children.

1866
01:39:20.041 --> 01:39:24.458
And it turns out
that we have the perfect candidat.

1867
01:39:24.916 --> 01:39:29.000
Listen to me well. if I hire Clara.
will all this scandal end?

1868
01:39:35.416 --> 01:39:38.458
Clara. welcome to the team.

1869
01:39:39.708 --> 01:39:41.375
What happened?

1870
01:39:42.291 --> 01:39:45.625
A miracle.
A miracle just happened here.

1871
01:39:52.666 --> 01:39:56.708
No demand?
Careful. no demand. right?

1872
01:40:04.875 --> 01:40:06.375
[notifications]

1873
01:40:10.166 --> 01:40:11.291
Hi!

1874
01:40:12.708 --> 01:40:13.916
Hi. hi!

1875
01:40:15.750 --> 01:40:17.666
- Hi.
- Oh. no.

1876
01:40:17.875 --> 01:40:20.000
Yet another group?
Fire him.

1877
01:40:20.125 --> 01:40:23.083
Yes. I made this group for when
any mommy has a problem.

1878
01:40:23.166 --> 01:40:26.208
it is a place where we will always.
always. always support her.

1879
01:40:26.291 --> 01:40:28.500
And how are we going to name it?

1880
01:40:28.625 --> 01:40:30.500
- As vice president.
- Treasurer.

1881
01:40:30.625 --> 01:40:32.250
- Is the same.
- Is not the same.

1882
01:40:32.333 --> 01:40:36.833
Well I suggest Guardian Angels.

1883
01:40:37.208 --> 01:40:39.625
- No.
- Mystical moms.

1884
01:40:40.125 --> 01:40:40.708
No.

1885
01:40:40.791 --> 01:40:43.833
And if we name it Silenced group.
which is how I am going to have it?

1886
01:40:43.916 --> 01:40:44.500
No.

1887
01:40:44.583 --> 01:40:46.916
- S.O.S.
- What did you say?

1888
01:40:47.250 --> 01:40:51.500
S.O.S. that's what my doctor calls
the pills he gives me to be happy.

1889
01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:56.458
S.O.S. Moms.

1890
01:40:57.208 --> 01:40:59.125
As in moms to the rescue.

1891
01:40:59.250 --> 01:41:02.166
I like it.
When any mommy has a problem.

1892
01:41:02.250 --> 01:41:04.875
she just has to send an S.O.S.

1893
01:41:04.958 --> 01:41:07.250
and the whole caravan
will be there to help her.

1894
01:41:07.333 --> 01:41:09.541
S.O.S. Moms.

1895
01:41:09.666 --> 01:41:12.000
Brilliant!
What a good idea I came up with!

1896
01:41:13.125 --> 01:41:16.333
- What? It was my idea.
- You. me. Clarita's.

1897
01:41:16.458 --> 01:41:18.916
Is the same.
A collective idea.

1898
01:41:20.416 --> 01:41:22.500
Clarita. what did
your godmother say to you

1899
01:41:22.583 --> 01:41:25.083
whe you told her that you
were staying in Santiago?

1900
01:41:25.375 --> 01:41:27.708
- My Godmother!
- How distracted!

1901
01:41:28.625 --> 01:41:31.583
Welcome Clarita
