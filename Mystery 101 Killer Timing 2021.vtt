and now the FBI thinks
he's after Travis.

674

might be the one who's behind
the explosion.

It... it's a theory.
It's just a theory.

But if that theory is right.

678
00:27:21.433 --> 00:27:22.834
then that means you were
the target.

I'm safe. We're taking
precautions.

If this guy is after you.

708

then I want to be included
in the investigation.

Do I need to give you the stay
out of harm's way speech again?

710
00:28:18.433 --> 00:28:20.166
I'm the one that told you
to be careful.

Did the Goffs ever mention they
had a son in any of the records?

802
00:32:02.133 --> 00:32:05.266
No. No. they didn't.

803
00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:06.600
So. with pellet stoves.

804
00:32:06.734 --> 00:32:07.800
sometimes if you don't
clean them

805
00:32:07.934 --> 00:32:10.333
the residue and the smoke
can create a small explosion.

806
00:32:10.467 --> 00:32:12.300
But this isn't a small
explosion.

807
00:32:12.433 --> 00:32:13.266
No.

808
00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:15.734

comes from here.

Alberto: Which doesn't
make sense.

810

Travis: All right.

812
00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:28.934
Did you think that stove.
did it heat the whole house?

813
00:32:29.066 --> 00:32:30.533
Alberto: They supplement
with natural gas.

814

Look. where the paper
is peeling.

822
00:32:44.133 --> 00:32:46.700
Are you talking about the fact
that this drywall

823
00:32:46.834 --> 00:32:47.934
is two different colors?

824
00:32:48.066 --> 00:32:49.667
Mm-hmm.

825
00:32:50.266 --> 00:32:52.266
Green's moisture resistant.

826
00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:56.934
I just don't understand why you
would only put that in one spot.

827
00:32:57.066 --> 00:32:59.166
Alberto: They ran out of
the other kind?

828
00:33:02.133 --> 00:33:05.333
I don't know. do you have a...

829
00:33:05.467 --> 00:33:06.567
Alberto: Be my guest.

830
00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:07.667
but there's no way the explosion
came from in there.

831
00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:08.667
No. I know that.

832
00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.934
Hey Amy. can you step back
for a second?

833
00:33:11.533 --> 00:33:12.400
What are you hoping to find?

834
00:33:12.533 --> 00:33:14.367
I'll tell you in a minute.

Travis: Good work. Sherlock.

837
00:33:48.433 --> 00:33:50.934
So. from what I know about
carbon dating.

838
00:33:51.066 --> 00:33:53.266
shouldn't you be able to tell
how old the body was

839
00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:56.000
at the time of death and when
that death took place?

840
00:33:56.133 --> 00:33:56.967
Thank you.

841
00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:58.100
Yep. that's correct.

842
00:33:58.233 --> 00:33:59.900
And we're also going to do a DNA
and dental records

843
00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:01.700
and run them through CODIS
and maybe we get lucky

844
00:34:01.834 --> 00:34:04.367
and our victim's in
the federal database.

845
00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.700
Alberto. how much time do
you need to get the results

846
00:34:06.834 --> 00:34:08.033
for your tests?

847
00:34:08.166 --> 00:34:08.967
Give me a few hours.

848
00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:09.834
Yeah? Good.

849
00:34:09.967 --> 00:34:11.633
I don't want to talk
to the Goffs

850
00:34:11.767 --> 00:34:14.133
until we get the results back
on both fronts.

851
00:34:14.266 --> 00:34:15.467
I'm going to go back
to the office.

852
00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.300
I'm going to run records and
a background check on the Goffs

853
00:34:17.433 --> 00:34:19.834
and on their nosy neighbor.
Mr. Breyer.

854
00:34:19.967 --> 00:34:21.066
I'll stay here and wait
for detail.

855
00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:22.033
Sounds good. buddy.

856
00:34:22.166 --> 00:34:23.033
You want to stick with me?

857
00:34:23.166 --> 00:34:24.633
Yeah. you know what
this reminds me of?

858
00:34:24.767 --> 00:34:25.667
What?

859
00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:28.300
Edgar Allan Poe's
"Murders in the Rue Morgue."

860
00:34:28.433 --> 00:34:31.166
Did Edgar Allan Poe write about
sticking a body in a wall?

861
00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:32.033
Up a chimney.

862
00:34:32.166 --> 00:34:34.667
Oh. wait a minute.
Hold on a minute.

863
00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.300
Claire told me this story
the day I met you.

864
00:34:37.433 --> 00:34:38.633
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

865
00:34:38.767 --> 00:34:39.567
Remember who the killer was?

866
00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:40.867
No.

867
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.400
But I remember meeting you.

868
00:34:42.533 --> 00:34:43.266
[laughs]

869
00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.700
Okay. you get extra credit
for that.

870
00:34:45.834 --> 00:34:48.133
No. the... the murderer
was an orangutang.

871
00:34:48.266 --> 00:34:49.066
That's right.

872
00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:51.800
He hid the body for fear
he'd be punished.

873
00:34:51.934 --> 00:34:54.700
Well. I bet you any money

874
00:34:54.834 --> 00:34:58.533
that our killer did what they
did for the same reason.

875
00:34:58.667 --> 00:34:59.667
Hmm.

876
00:35:03.333 --> 00:35:05.066
All right. so the Goffs
don't have a record.

877
00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.367
and looks like Bill Breyer

878
00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:09.867
got his first Washington State
driver's license last year.

879
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.066
I wonder where he was
before that.

880
00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:11.767
Chicago.

881
00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:13.233
I searched William Breyer.

882
00:35:13.367 --> 00:35:14.266
[laughs]

883
00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.533
It says here that he worked
at a law firm

884
00:35:16.667 --> 00:35:18.133
called Lampert and Burnham
for 20 years.

885
00:35:18.266 --> 00:35:19.200
Wait. what?

886
00:35:19.333 --> 00:35:20.233
What?

887
00:35:20.367 --> 00:35:22.433
Eva Bianco. Lewandowski's
lawyer. The Wolfman.

888
00:35:22.567 --> 00:35:24.433
she works at Lampert
and Burnham.

889
00:35:24.567 --> 00:35:27.767
I gotta call Special Agent
Coulson.

[whispers]
Synchronicity.

891
00:35:30.734 --> 00:35:31.467
Huh.

892
00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:32.900
Yeah. I'll hold.

893
00:35:33.033 --> 00:35:34.600
What is synchronicity.
is that like a...

894
00:35:34.734 --> 00:35:36.900
a series of coincidences.

895
00:35:37.033 --> 00:35:39.633
Well. sort of.
Not really.

896
00:35:39.767 --> 00:35:41.467
It's... it's more about timing.

897
00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.100
For instance. you know.
you getting almost blown up

898
00:35:44.233 --> 00:35:46.867
by an explosion. practically
next door to the lawyer

899
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.934
who might've worked with
The Wolfman's attorney.

900
00:35:49.066 --> 00:35:50.767
I mean it's...
it's fascinating.

901
00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:52.166
It's a voicemail.

902
00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:54.567
Hey. this is Travis. uh. Burke.
Call me back when you get this.

903
00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:56.300
Thanks. bye.

904
00:35:57.266 --> 00:35:58.667
Hmm.

905
00:35:59.233 --> 00:36:01.700
Speaking of Agent Coulson...

906
00:36:02.967 --> 00:36:07.000
I know that you said that
your ex-wife was an FBI agent.

907
00:36:07.133 --> 00:36:10.266
and well. my dad said that
her name was Kate. so...

908
00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:11.533
[knocking]

909
00:36:11.667 --> 00:36:13.934
CODIS is back up. so we're
still waiting on DNA and dental.

910
00:36:14.066 --> 00:36:15.867
but Alberto has news.

911
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.633
That table near the pellet stove
had mercury fulminate on it.

912
00:36:19.767 --> 00:36:22.166
Totally harmless until
it's triggered by a shock.

913
00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:24.767
Like an explosion
from a pellet stove.

914
00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:27.834
Wait a minute. what was mercury
fulminate doing in the house?

915
00:36:27.967 --> 00:36:29.633
[sighs heavily]

916
00:36:29.767 --> 00:36:31.533
Let's go ask the Goffs.

917
00:36:31.667 --> 00:36:34.000
♪

918
00:36:35.767 --> 00:36:37.200
We're so glad you're all right.
Detective.

919
00:36:37.333 --> 00:36:39.667
Thank you. thank you.
And how are you guys doing?

920
00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.600
Well I mean. unsettled.

921
00:36:41.734 --> 00:36:44.367
But glad we have a roof
over our heads.

922
00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:46.433
I think we got the last
available room.

923
00:36:46.567 --> 00:36:48.867
and I think every other guest
is a birder.

924
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.266
Yeah. it's the season for it.

925
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.100
Uh. this is Alberto.
He's the fire marshal.

926
00:36:52.233 --> 00:36:53.967
He's going to tell you
how your house blew up.

927
00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:56.800
So it started with a small
explosion in the pellet stove.

928
00:36:56.934 --> 00:36:58.300
which can happen when
those aren't cleaned

929
00:36:58.433 --> 00:37:00.066
on a regular basis.

930
00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:02.667
But that should've been
contained by the stove.

931
00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.233
It was. but I believe the shock

932
00:37:04.367 --> 00:37:07.500
triggered a chemical
you had on the table.

933
00:37:07.633 --> 00:37:10.533
That's mercury fulminate.

934
00:37:10.667 --> 00:37:12.700
Can you explain what
that was doing there?

935
00:37:12.834 --> 00:37:14.734
I teach science
at Garrison High.

936
00:37:14.867 --> 00:37:17.166
When I order supplies
for my science class.

937
00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:19.700
I have them sent to my home
for safety.

938
00:37:19.834 --> 00:37:24.200
I... I must have left the
mercury fulminate on the table.

939
00:37:24.333 --> 00:37:26.900
Look folks. seems like a case
of bad timing.

940
00:37:27.033 --> 00:37:28.367
I'm writing this up
as an accident.

941
00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:30.333
but Detective Burke
has something else

942
00:37:30.467 --> 00:37:31.767
to discuss with you.

943
00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:33.500
Okay. thanks Alberto.

944
00:37:33.633 --> 00:37:38.100
Um. can you folks confirm for
me when you bought the house.

945
00:37:38.233 --> 00:37:40.000
About 10 years ago?

946
00:37:40.133 --> 00:37:40.900
10 years ago.

947
00:37:41.033 --> 00:37:41.867
Why?

948
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.667
Um well. because...

949
00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:48.800
Well. we found this in the wall
near the stove.

950
00:37:50.533 --> 00:37:52.100
Mummified remains. yes.

951
00:37:52.233 --> 00:37:52.934
In our house?

952
00:37:53.066 --> 00:37:53.667
Yes.

953
00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:54.700
This is horrible.

954
00:37:54.834 --> 00:37:57.233
Did you do any refurbishing
in that room?

955
00:37:57.367 --> 00:37:58.400
Um. no.

956
00:37:58.533 --> 00:38:00.500
None.

957
00:38:00.633 --> 00:38:03.633
Do you remember who you bought
the house from?

958
00:38:03.767 --> 00:38:05.767
Uh. I honestly can't remember
their names.

959
00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:07.500
We never met.

960
00:38:07.633 --> 00:38:09.100
But you could check
the real estate records

961
00:38:09.233 --> 00:38:10.500
in our filing cabinet.

962
00:38:10.633 --> 00:38:13.266
You mean this filing cabinet?

963
00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:18.633
How about the realtor?
You know that name?

964
00:38:18.767 --> 00:38:20.433
Uh. Nick Groombridge?

965
00:38:20.567 --> 00:38:21.300
I know Nick.

966
00:38:21.433 --> 00:38:22.934
He sold me my house.

967
00:38:23.066 --> 00:38:25.734
He retired about a year ago.
moved to San Diego.

968
00:38:25.867 --> 00:38:26.934
Okay. good.

969
00:38:27.066 --> 00:38:31.633
Um. well then we'll check
the county records. all right?

970
00:38:31.767 --> 00:38:33.033
Thank you both.

971
00:38:33.734 --> 00:38:36.133
You going to stay here
and take a rest?

972
00:38:36.266 --> 00:38:38.066
I'm actually feeling
pretty good.

973
00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.066
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

974
00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:40.233
You know what would make me
feel better?

975
00:38:40.367 --> 00:38:41.667
What?

976
00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:44.100
Linguini and clams
at Torcolettis.

977
00:38:44.233 --> 00:38:46.166
Oh. okay. okay.

978
00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:49.100
All right. Let me do
this paperwork

979
00:38:49.233 --> 00:38:50.834
and then I'll meet you there.

980
00:38:51.767 --> 00:38:53.633
I'm not going to blame it
on the concussion. but...

981
00:38:53.767 --> 00:38:55.900
I rode with you?

982
00:38:56.033 --> 00:38:56.767
Oh.

983
00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:58.233
So then why don't
you come with me.

984
00:38:58.367 --> 00:38:59.133
help me with the paperwork...

985
00:38:59.266 --> 00:38:59.834
Ahh.

986
00:38:59.967 --> 00:39:01.100
No. no. no.

987
00:39:01.233 --> 00:39:03.367
I see what you're doing there.
but I like the paperwork.

988
00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:04.033
You like it?

989
00:39:04.166 --> 00:39:05.066
-Yeah.
-Here.

990
00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.400
[laughs]

991
00:39:06.533 --> 00:39:09.133
And... boom!

992
00:39:09.266 --> 00:39:10.300
Too soon. Travis.

993
00:39:10.433 --> 00:39:11.500
It's too soon for boom?

994
00:39:11.633 --> 00:39:12.667
Yes.

995
00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.200
Looking good.

996
00:39:20.033 --> 00:39:21.233
Amy. I'm talking about
your board.

997
00:39:21.367 --> 00:39:22.533
Your board looks good.

998
00:39:22.667 --> 00:39:24.166
[laughs]
Okay.

999
00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:25.667
I can tell you're hungry.

1000
00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.867
Let's go get you some
linguini and clams.

1001
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.800
Yes. I would like that
very. very much.

1002
00:39:29.934 --> 00:39:32.467
One condition. we don't
talk about that.

1003
00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:33.767
No. Mm-mm.

1004
00:39:34.834 --> 00:39:35.533
Maria: Travis?

1005
00:39:35.667 --> 00:39:36.633
Yeah?

1006
00:39:36.767 --> 00:39:37.500
You have a visitor.

1007
00:39:37.633 --> 00:39:38.367
Hi. hi...

1008
00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:39.767
Hi.

1009
00:39:40.166 --> 00:39:44.000
Uh... Um...

1010
00:39:44.133 --> 00:39:47.233
Uh... Professor Amy Winslow.

1011
00:39:47.367 --> 00:39:48.867
Uh...

1012
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000
Special Agent Kate Coulson.

1013
00:39:59.166 --> 00:40:00.700
but I got paper towels.

1014
00:40:00.834 --> 00:40:01.900
Oh. perfect.
Thank you.

1015
00:40:02.033 --> 00:40:03.100
Thank you.

1016
00:40:03.233 --> 00:40:05.533
So it looks like the explosion
was a freak accident.

1017
00:40:05.667 --> 00:40:08.133
So while I appreciate
the gesture.

1018
00:40:08.266 --> 00:40:10.500
you didn't really need
to come out here. Kate.

1019
00:40:11.433 --> 00:40:14.133
Thank you. I respectfully
disagree.

1020
00:40:14.266 --> 00:40:15.700
Lewandowski's still in the wind.

1021
00:40:15.834 --> 00:40:18.567
and I am looking at his
number one target.

1022
00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:21.867
And I want to talk
to this Bill Breyer guy.

1023
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.400
I don't. I don't
like coincidences.

1024
00:40:23.533 --> 00:40:25.734
Mm. Professor Winslow and I

1025
00:40:25.867 --> 00:40:28.800
were just talking about
synchronicity.

1026
00:40:28.934 --> 00:40:30.567
Ah. the great Carl Jung.

1027
00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:32.200
You're a fan?

1028
00:40:32.333 --> 00:40:33.233
Uh. yeah.

1029
00:40:33.367 --> 00:40:34.867
Jungian archetypes are good
for profiling.

1030
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.100
Are you a psych professor?

1031
00:40:37.233 --> 00:40:38.867
Literature.

1032
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.133
Yeah. Professor Winslow
specializes in crime fiction.

1033
00:40:43.266 --> 00:40:44.266
And you brought her in.

1034
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.400
Mm-hmm.

1035
00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:48.433
Why is that a surprise?

1036
00:40:48.567 --> 00:40:50.200
Because he hates crime fiction.

1037
00:40:50.333 --> 00:40:52.300
Uh. you know. things change.

1038
00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:55.700
For the record. I am a huge fan
of consultants.

1039
00:40:55.834 --> 00:40:57.533
We use them a lot at the bureau.

1040
00:40:57.667 --> 00:41:00.367
I just have never heard of using
a literature professor.

1041
00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:03.200
But I guess things change.

1042
00:41:03.333 --> 00:41:07.000
So. let's talk about
the serial killer

1043
00:41:07.133 --> 00:41:09.266
who wants to make you pay.

1044
00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:13.066
and how we are going to use you
to catch him.

1045
00:41:13.633 --> 00:41:15.934
Me? I'm bait?

1046
00:41:16.066 --> 00:41:17.367
I'm sorry. bait?

1047
00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:19.333
It's a full moon tomorrow.

1048
00:41:19.467 --> 00:41:22.133
which as you know is our window
of opportunity to get this guy.

1049
00:41:22.266 --> 00:41:23.500
So we have to lay out
a situation

1050
00:41:23.633 --> 00:41:26.300
where he is tempted
to strike.

1051
00:41:26.433 --> 00:41:29.533
You mean. where he's tempted
to kill Travis.

1052
00:41:29.667 --> 00:41:30.867
Amy. we've done this before.

1053
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.800
So what you do. is you... you
set somebody on a target out.

1054
00:41:33.934 --> 00:41:35.967
it's easy for the killer
to get to and... tcch.

1055
00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:36.967
Yes.

1056
00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:38.800
No. no!

1057
00:41:38.934 --> 00:41:39.967
You have a concussion.

1058
00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:41.867
You just got out
of the hospital.

1059
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.934
I mean. is there no other way?

1060
00:41:45.066 --> 00:41:47.100
He can't put himself in danger.

1061
00:41:47.233 --> 00:41:48.800
There's minimal danger.

1062
00:41:48.934 --> 00:41:50.600
The advantage of where
you guys live

1063
00:41:50.734 --> 00:41:53.100
is that we can locate
a remote cabin.

1064
00:41:53.233 --> 00:41:54.800
we can put officers there
earlier in the day

1065
00:41:54.934 --> 00:41:56.834
so that when Travis goes.
we are fortified

1066
00:41:56.967 --> 00:41:59.300
to both draw Lewandowski in
and to get him.

1067
00:41:59.433 --> 00:42:01.033
Okay. that all sounds
very dangerous.

1068
00:42:01.166 --> 00:42:03.100
Amy. Kate's right.

1069
00:42:03.233 --> 00:42:06.200
She's right. look.
We have this window. all right?

1070
00:42:06.333 --> 00:42:11.333
If that window closes we have to
wait until the next full moon.

1071
00:42:11.467 --> 00:42:12.934
So it's. it's okay.

-Couple hours.

1079

Oh. Because there are
no hotels available in Garrison.

birdwatcher invasion.

00:49:17.767 --> 00:49:19.967
Prying in your relationship
with Travis.

1250
00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:22.266
Oh. no worries.

1251
00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:24.266
I predicted that city boy
wouldn't last a month

1252
00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:25.967
in a place like this.

1253
00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:28.066
But here he is.

1254
00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:29.400
[laughs]

1255
00:49:29.533 --> 00:49:30.800
Never underestimate him.

1256
00:49:30.934 --> 00:49:32.767
This looks amazing.
thank you so much.

1257
00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:34.967
You're welcome.

1258
00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:36.600
Amy. I want to be clear
about something.

1259
00:49:36.734 --> 00:49:39.533
I care about Travis.

1260
00:49:39.667 --> 00:49:41.066
But not like I used to.

1261
00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:43.800
That chapter closed
a while ago.

1262
00:49:43.934 --> 00:49:48.767
But I do want to see him happy.

1263
00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:49.934
That being said.

1264
00:49:50.066 --> 00:49:52.433
if there's not something going
on between you two.

1265
00:49:52.567 --> 00:49:54.266
I could see how there
could be.

Hey. you're on speakerphone
with me and Amy.

1272
00:50:01.734 --> 00:50:02.600
Got anything?

1273
00:50:02.734 --> 00:50:03.800
Nothing.

1274
00:50:03.934 --> 00:50:04.567
I don't get it.

1275
00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:07.233
Full moon. me looking all alone.

1276
00:50:07.367 --> 00:50:09.200
Do you think that maybe
he was onto the presence

1277
00:50:09.333 --> 00:50:10.633
of the other cops?

1278
00:50:10.767 --> 00:50:12.967
No. not possible.

1279
00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:16.734
Okay. So maybe he's not here.

1280
00:50:16.867 --> 00:50:18.767
Or maybe we have to wait
for another full moon.

1282
00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:21.633
Oh. I got a call back
from Bill Breyer.

1283
00:50:21.767 --> 00:50:24.433
He's free to talk this morning.

1284
00:50:24.567 --> 00:50:25.900
Okay.

1285
00:50:27.433 --> 00:50:29.133
At least he's safe.

♪

1287
00:50:35.533 --> 00:50:37.800
So I want to apologize.

1288
00:50:37.934 --> 00:50:40.100
I wasn't completely honest
with you the other day

1289
00:50:40.233 --> 00:50:43.800
when you asked about my
relationship with the Goffs.

1290
00:50:43.934 --> 00:50:45.767
Okay?

1291
00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:49.100
A couple of months ago I made
an offer on their house

1292
00:50:49.233 --> 00:50:51.066
and they rejected it.

1293
00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.934
You wanted to buy the house that
you lived down the street from?

1294
00:50:54.066 --> 00:50:55.367
I wanted to help them out.

1295
00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:57.400
They'd gone through
a terrible ordeal.

1296
00:50:57.533 --> 00:51:01.000
Did it have anything to do
with their son?

1297
00:51:01.133 --> 00:51:02.166
Yes.

1298
00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:04.867
How did you know?

1299
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.667
Um. well. I... when I was
in the Goff's house

1300
00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:11.633
I just happened to see
a photo of a boy

1301
00:51:11.767 --> 00:51:13.000
growing into a teenager.

1302
00:51:13.133 --> 00:51:17.166
It was actually that boy there.
I think that was the same photo.

1303
00:51:19.066 --> 00:51:21.433
Terry. Great kid.

1304
00:51:21.567 --> 00:51:23.200
Wanted to be a lawyer.

1305
00:51:23.333 --> 00:51:26.600
Bill: So we got to be pals.

1306
00:51:26.734 --> 00:51:27.967
And what happened?

1307
00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:30.600
ALS.

1308
00:51:30.734 --> 00:51:33.767
Mel and Rita did everything
they could for him.

1309
00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:35.967
Spared no expense.

1310
00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:37.500
When did he die?

1311
00:51:37.633 --> 00:51:40.133
Five months ago.

1312
00:51:40.266 --> 00:51:48.433
Afterward. I made the offer on
the house and they got upset.

1313
00:51:48.567 --> 00:51:49.533
Hmm.

1314
00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:53.800
I'm sorry about your loss.

1315
00:51:53.934 --> 00:51:56.333
Did you happen to know
the previous owners

1316
00:51:56.467 --> 00:51:57.967
of that house.
by any chance?

1317
00:51:58.100 --> 00:51:59.500
Judy Ellis or her boys?

1318
00:51:59.633 --> 00:52:02.200
She had twins.
Darren and David?

1319
00:52:02.333 --> 00:52:04.433
I only moved here a little over
a year ago.

1320
00:52:04.567 --> 00:52:06.367
Yeah. from Chicago. right?

1321
00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:08.200
Yeah. How did you...

1322
00:52:08.333 --> 00:52:11.333
Eva Bianco from Lampert
and Burnham.

1323
00:52:11.467 --> 00:52:14.100
When was the last time
you talked to her?

1324
00:52:14.233 --> 00:52:16.433
What's going on here?

1325
00:52:16.567 --> 00:52:18.166
This isn't about the house.

1326
00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:20.266
No sir. It's about
Jeffrey Lewandowski.

1327
00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:21.266
The serial killer?

1328
00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:22.133
Mm-hmm.

1329
00:52:22.266 --> 00:52:24.700
I... I saw the news.
He escaped.

1330
00:52:24.834 --> 00:52:26.200
Eva was his attorney.

1331
00:52:28.533 --> 00:52:29.600

Burke.

1333
00:52:31.667 --> 00:52:33.767
You're the one
that put him away.

1334
00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:35.834
You got a target on your back.

1335
00:52:35.967 --> 00:52:38.000
So you're thinking maybe
the explosion at the house

1336
00:52:38.133 --> 00:52:39.734
had something to do...

1337
00:52:39.867 --> 00:52:41.867
No. the explosion
was an accident.

1338
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.233
We were just struck
by the synchronicity

1339
00:52:43.367 --> 00:52:45.567
of you working with Eva.

1340
00:52:48.667 --> 00:52:51.033
Well. I uh. I wish
I could help you.

1341
00:52:51.166 --> 00:52:55.567
But I haven't spoken to Eva
since I retired from L&B.

1342
00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:58.500
and that was well over
a year ago.

1343
00:52:58.633 --> 00:52:59.734
All right.

1344
00:53:01.867 --> 00:53:02.700
Thank you. Mr. Breyer.

1345
00:53:02.834 --> 00:53:04.834
-You're more than welcome.
-Thank you.

1346
00:53:07.734 --> 00:53:11.467
Amy. what did you think?

1347
00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:13.567
Well. I mean. Bill did seem
genuinely upset

1348
00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:16.066
about Terry's death. you know.

1349
00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:17.567
Clearly wants to help the Goffs.

1350
00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:19.333
just like he did the night
where he called 911

1351
00:53:19.467 --> 00:53:21.300
after the explosion.

1352
00:53:21.433 --> 00:53:26.333
but if that has any ties
to Lewandowski. I don't know.

1353
00:53:26.467 --> 00:53:29.767
See after last night
and this being a bust.

1354
00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:31.033
I don't know.

1355
00:53:31.166 --> 00:53:33.667
Maybe we're all wrong about
The Wolfman coming after me.

1356
00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:35.967
I hear you. but playing
devil's advocate.

1357
00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:38.300
Lewandowski's had over a year
to plot his revenge.

1358
00:53:38.433 --> 00:53:40.667
which won't be simple
because nothing with him is.

1359
00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:42.600
So I'm going to stay a couple
days. if I may.

1360

It looks like they're both
good to talk.

I've just got to interview

for the Dean of Students
position.

1371
00:54:01.533 --> 00:54:03.633
so I'll talk to you guys later.

1372
00:54:03.767 --> 00:54:04.467
Okay.

1378
00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:14.433
Hey.

1379
00:54:14.567 --> 00:54:16.367
Listen. I wanted to talk to you
about the twin brothers

1380
00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:17.900
who have condos
in your building.

1381
00:54:18.033 --> 00:54:18.800
Do you know them?

1382
00:54:18.934 --> 00:54:20.834
David and Darren Ellis?
Yeah. why?

1383
00:54:20.967 --> 00:54:22.734
You remember the house
I told you that blew up?

1384
00:54:22.867 --> 00:54:23.633
Right.

1385
00:54:23.767 --> 00:54:24.667
Well. they used to own it

1386
00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:26.800
and we found a dead body
hidden in the wall.

1387
00:54:26.934 --> 00:54:27.834
What?

1388
00:54:27.967 --> 00:54:29.667
I know. I know. it's crazy.

1389
00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:33.467
So. I mean. do you think that
they would be capable of murder?

1390
00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:34.633
[laughs]

1391
00:54:34.767 --> 00:54:36.166
The only people they would be
capable of murdering

1392
00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:38.133
would be each other.

1393
00:54:38.266 --> 00:54:39.834
In all seriousness. they're...
they're good guys.

1394
00:54:39.967 --> 00:54:41.033
I know them well.

1395
00:54:41.166 --> 00:54:43.066
I feed Darren's fish when
he's gone. water David's plants.

1396
00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:45.400
but they cannot stand
each other.

1397
00:54:45.533 --> 00:54:47.033
They haven't spoken in years.

1398
00:54:47.166 --> 00:54:47.967
Interesting.

1399
00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:49.066
Yeah.

1400
00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:51.066
Okay. Well listen.
I have candidate interviews.

1401
00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:51.600
I've got to go.

How are you?

1407
00:54:59.433 --> 00:55:00.600
I'm well.

1408
00:55:00.734 --> 00:55:02.734
I'm glad to finally be
interviewing someone in person.

00:55:02.867 --> 00:55:04.967

for the past three hours.

1411
00:55:06.767 --> 00:55:08.800
So. here we are.

1412
00:55:08.934 --> 00:55:09.867
Here we are.

1413
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.934
You applied for the Dean
of Students position.

1414
00:55:12.066 --> 00:55:19.233
I did. But I gotta
tell you that. uh...

1415
00:55:19.367 --> 00:55:22.100
Joe got offered a job to run
the IT department

1416
00:55:22.233 --> 00:55:24.266
at Oxford University.

1417
00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:26.200
and he asked me to go
with him.

1418
00:55:26.333 --> 00:55:28.300
What? All the way to England?

1419
00:55:28.433 --> 00:55:30.800
I know. I... I've got some
sabbatical time saved up.

1420
00:55:30.934 --> 00:55:31.800
so I thought...

1421
00:55:31.934 --> 00:55:35.900
But not if you're the new
Dean of Students.

1422
00:55:36.033 --> 00:55:36.867
Are you withdrawing?

1423
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.600
No.

1424
00:55:38.734 --> 00:55:42.734
I want this job. and I'm the
right candidate for this job.

No. but here's something
interesting.

1459
00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:03.000
Judy Ellis can't be the body
in the wall.

1460
00:57:03.133 --> 00:57:04.467
She was an amputee.

Hmm. Well. that's conclusive.

1462

You know. but just because
it's not her

1463
00:57:08.633 --> 00:57:10.467
doesn't mean that the twins
are innocent.

1464
00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:13.266
In fact. there could be
potentially dozens of suspects.

1465
00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:16.967
They rented their house every
ski season and went to Florida.

1466
00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:20.066
So. depending on when the body
went in the wall...

1467
00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:22.834
Yeah. exactly. It could be any
one of their renters.

1468
00:57:22.967 --> 00:57:25.000
Do they have any records?

1469
00:57:25.133 --> 00:57:27.166
They do. um. but here's
the thing.

1470
00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:29.734
It's in a. they're
in a storage facility.

And let me guess.

1473
00:57:34.133 --> 00:57:35.200
Each one of the twins have a key

1474
00:57:35.333 --> 00:57:38.300
and they won't be in the same
room at the same time.

1475
00:57:38.433 --> 00:57:39.467
Bingo.

1476
00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:41.400
So now I got to go convince
a judge

1477
00:57:41.533 --> 00:57:44.333

them into the same room.

why the Goff's house blew up.

Well. no. sorry.
Let me rephrase that.

1486
00:58:01.967 --> 00:58:04.900
I know the motive as to why
the Goff's house blew up.

1487
00:58:05.033 --> 00:58:07.734

with the time of their accident.

So. I just have a few more
questions I need to ask you

1493
00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:27.000
before the fire marshal
submits his report

1494
00:58:27.133 --> 00:58:31.033

and you guys get your check.

Sounds terrific.

1496
00:58:32.166 --> 00:58:33.667
What did you want to ask?

1497
00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:37.567
Well. the one question
I want to start with is.

1498
00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:41.133
I'm just curious. why didn't you
sell your house to Bill Breyer?

1499
00:58:41.266 --> 00:58:42.967
Well. you know.
just sentimental value.

1500
00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:44.233
Yeah.

1501
00:58:44.367 --> 00:58:45.967
Are you sure it wasn't because
you took a second mortgage

1502
00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:48.867
out on the house to pay
for your son's treatments?

1503
00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:52.467
How did you get this?

1504
00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:54.800
That's... our bank statement.

1505
00:58:54.934 --> 00:58:56.233
Yeah. No. I got a warrant
for that.

1506
00:58:56.367 --> 00:59:00.300
See. and what this tells me
is you guys are behind

1507
00:59:00.433 --> 00:59:03.033
on your payments.

1508
00:59:03.166 --> 00:59:07.467
If you accepted
Bill Breyer's offer.

1509
00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:10.533
that check. that would've
gone straight to the bank.

1510
00:59:10.667 --> 00:59:14.934
But if you blow up
half your house.

1511
00:59:15.066 --> 00:59:17.133
well then you get this huge
insurance payout.

1512
00:59:17.266 --> 00:59:20.066
and then all your financial
troubles are solved.

1513
00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:21.800

by nature.

into your car at 6:20.

and play you waiting patiently

so that you can bump into it.

1526
01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.700

that conveniently kept you away

1527

that you packed with pellets

fulminate that you planted.

in hopes that you could somehow
get into that house.

1768
01:11:00.433 --> 01:11:04.633
But what you didn't know.
was how sick he was.

1769

and how much his parents
cared for him.

1770
01:11:06.133 --> 01:11:07.233
