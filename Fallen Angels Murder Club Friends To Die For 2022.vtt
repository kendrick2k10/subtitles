00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:14.057
[Rena laughs]
Yes.

177
00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:15.559
Well. whatever's going on
with him at the moment

178
00:07:15.686 --> 00:07:18.270
seems pretty heated.

179
00:07:18.355 --> 00:07:19.729
[Rory yelling]
Come on!

180
00:07:19.857 --> 00:07:22.065
You think it's
business or pleasure?

181
00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:24.568
Well it's Rory.
Business is pleasure.

182
00:07:24.695 --> 00:07:28.238
[Rory yelling] No no. no.
You need to listen to me. okay.

183
00:07:28.365 --> 00:07:30.365
[Rory yelling]
No. forget it!

184
00:07:30.451 --> 00:07:31.950
Jeez.

185
00:07:32.035 --> 00:07:34.035
[Rory yelling] Well. what
do you expect me to do?

186
00:07:35.247 --> 00:07:38.081
[Abby] "World at Midnight" to
be continued tomorrow.

187
00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:39.666
[Hollis]
Yes.

188
00:07:39.751 --> 00:07:41.585
To quote Rosemarie. "Might as
well beat it 'til it's dead."

189
00:07:41.712 --> 00:07:42.961
[Abby]
Sorry. Hollis. See you later.

190
00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:44.337
[Miller]
Thank you for having me.

191
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:47.507
[Rory]
Good night.

192
00:07:49.553 --> 00:07:51.636
Ah! Rory!
Thank you.

193
00:07:52.431 --> 00:07:53.755
[Rory]
Drive safe now.

194
00:07:53.849 --> 00:07:55.140
[Rory]
Oh boy!

195
00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:56.433
[laughs]
Somebody had fun.

196
00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.477
Thank you. Thank you.

197
00:07:58.562 --> 00:07:59.978
Yeah. you sure had fun tonight.

198
00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:02.272
Yeah. I did. I sure did.

199
00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:03.264
Careful now.

200
00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:04.691
[Gene]
Yeah. I got it.

201
00:08:05.611 --> 00:08:07.444
Well well well.

202
00:08:07.571 --> 00:08:09.779
Everybody just loves your book.
Hmm?

203
00:08:09.907 --> 00:08:11.781
I know. right?

204
00:08:13.243 --> 00:08:16.203
I. ah. I thought
you had to leave?

205
00:08:16.288 --> 00:08:18.955
You know. I was looking
at these cigars...

206
00:08:19.082 --> 00:08:24.377
I've seen these before.
like a few years back.

207
00:08:24.463 --> 00:08:26.546
And I remember them because

208
00:08:26.632 --> 00:08:32.794
my friend who had them
wasn't really a cigar smoker.

209
00:08:32.888 --> 00:08:36.890
And he definitely couldn't
afford 30.000 dollar cigars.

210
00:08:36.975 --> 00:08:39.976
But his were in. you
know. a regular box.

211
00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:44.981
not a fancy humidor.

212
00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:46.441
Where'd you say you got these?

213
00:08:46.527 --> 00:08:48.109
They were a gift.

214
00:08:48.195 --> 00:08:49.978
Oh.

215
00:08:50.072 --> 00:08:52.480
I guess somebody in
Philly likes giving away

216
00:08:52.574 --> 00:08:55.408
30.000 dollar cigars. huh?

217
00:08:56.787 --> 00:08:59.204
[Rory's phone rings]

218
00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:00.413
Sorry.

219
00:09:00.499 --> 00:09:01.790
Oh. okay.

220
00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:03.166
[Rory on phone]
Hello?

221
00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:06.503
Hey! You can call me back
10 times if you like.

222
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:07.671
but it doesn't change anything.

223
00:09:07.798 --> 00:09:09.673
Those are my terms. All right?

224
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.341
[chuckles]
No no.

225
00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:13.260
I hold the cards here.

226
00:09:22.521 --> 00:09:24.229
Well. I better get going.

227
00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:25.647
Yeah.

228
00:09:57.806 --> 00:09:59.556
Listen. Hollis.

229
00:09:59.683 --> 00:10:03.268
I know you're still bitter about
what your husband did to you.

230
00:10:03.353 --> 00:10:06.387
And I'm sure you have a lot
of unanswered questions.

231
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:09.557
but at some point you have
to move on with your life.

232
00:10:09.651 --> 00:10:11.985
What are you talking about?

233
00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:15.405
Not everything is a clue to some
great mystery from your past.

234
00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:17.741
Some things are
just a coincidence.

235
00:10:17.868 --> 00:10:19.409
Nothing more.

236
00:10:19.536 --> 00:10:20.619
Let it go.

237
00:10:20.704 --> 00:10:22.287
Wait a minute. Hold up.

238
00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:24.414
Is there something
I should know about?

239
00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:25.907
Because it sure as
hell feels like it.

240
00:10:26.001 --> 00:10:27.584
[Rory shouts] You don't wanna
do this. Hollis.

241
00:10:28.754 --> 00:10:33.006
You don't want any
part of my world.

242
00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:34.966
Trust me.

243
00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:44.809
Oh you know this
isn't over yet. right?

244
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:55.278
Yes it is.

245
00:10:57.741 --> 00:10:59.449
[car engine starts]

246
00:11:31.566 --> 00:11:33.358
[breathes heavily]

247
00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:39.489
[glass smashing]

248
00:11:57.217 --> 00:11:59.384
Avery.
Good morning.

249
00:11:59.469 --> 00:12:01.094
Good morning.

250
00:12:10.731 --> 00:12:11.688
So...

251
00:12:11.815 --> 00:12:13.022
How goes the studying?

252
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:14.524
You ready to take that bar exam?

253
00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:17.402
Sure. Sign me up now.
I'll be there.

254
00:12:17.487 --> 00:12:19.353
I don't know why you
keep putting it off.

255
00:12:19.448 --> 00:12:21.573
You're smarter than most
of the lawyers I know.

256
00:12:21.658 --> 00:12:22.782
Including you?

257
00:12:22.868 --> 00:12:24.659
[scoffs]
Let's not get carried away.

258
00:12:24.745 --> 00:12:28.371
But. you do need to
stop procrastinating.

259
00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:29.914
It's not what you think. Mark.

260
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.083
I'll take the exam in due time.

261
00:12:32.169 --> 00:12:33.668
Yeah.

262
00:12:35.964 --> 00:12:38.206
[Hollis]
Look. So adorable!

263
00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.216
[Mark] Are you talking
about her or Avery?

264
00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:41.760
Seriously?

265
00:12:41.845 --> 00:12:44.512
Okay. both! But in
very different ways.

266
00:12:44.598 --> 00:12:46.139
Please don't tell
him I said that.

267
00:12:46.224 --> 00:12:47.381
Yeah. your secret's
safe with me.

268
00:12:47.476 --> 00:12:49.550
-But for a price.
-Ha ha.

269
00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:51.436
[Mark] Okay.
Here comes Mr. Adorable.

270
00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:52.604
Let's look professional.

271
00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:57.567
Hollis. Mark. let me introduce
you to Marla Wilson.

272
00:12:57.694 --> 00:12:59.944
Marla. you are in good hands.

273
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.571
Charmed.

274
00:13:01.698 --> 00:13:03.323
Lovely to meet you. Mrs. Wilson.

275
00:13:03.408 --> 00:13:05.408
Uh huh.

276
00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:07.285
I'll be trusting you
two to figure out

277
00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.579
who gets my stuff
when I die.

278
00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:11.998
Mainly you. Holland.

279
00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:13.958
Hollis. Hollis.
We can...

280
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:18.797
All right.

281
00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:21.090
[Mrs. Wilson]
My baby sister.

282
00:13:21.218 --> 00:13:23.301
Carrie was her name.

283
00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:25.553
Oh. she was a
hellion. that one.

284
00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:26.921
[Hollis chuckles]

285
00:13:27.015 --> 00:13:29.766
But she always had my back.

286
00:13:29.893 --> 00:13:31.017
You look a lot like her.

287
00:13:31.102 --> 00:13:32.760
Oh?

288
00:13:32.854 --> 00:13:35.313
I'm counting on you to
have my back. Hollis.

289
00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:37.190
Keep these boys honest.

290
00:13:37.275 --> 00:13:38.817
Avery and Mark are
really good guys.

291
00:13:38.902 --> 00:13:40.401
They'll look out for
you and so will I.

292
00:13:40.487 --> 00:13:41.486
You have my word.

293
00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:43.238
That's all I can ask.

294
00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.199
Oh. girl.

295
00:13:46.284 --> 00:13:48.034
I can run up and
down these stairs

296
00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:49.452
faster than a 10-year-old.

297
00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:50.453
You get back to work.

298
00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.163
Okay. That's right.

299
00:13:52.249 --> 00:13:53.331
I got this.

300
00:13:53.416 --> 00:13:54.874
Okay. Ms. Marla.

301
00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.419
Have a great day.

302
00:14:04.135 --> 00:14:05.051
[Miller]
Okay. come on.

303
00:14:05.136 --> 00:14:07.053
Even Rena's here.
And Rory's not?

304
00:14:07.138 --> 00:14:08.304
[Gene] Yeah. let's just
start without him.

305
00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:09.681
Okay. calm down. boys!

306
00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:11.299
It's not like you have
anything else to do tonight.

307
00:14:11.393 --> 00:14:12.851
Exactly. right?

308
00:14:12.936 --> 00:14:14.227
[footsteps approaching]

309
00:14:14.312 --> 00:14:15.520
Finally!

310
00:14:25.574 --> 00:14:29.242
Sorry.
Didn't know anyone was here.

311
00:14:29.327 --> 00:14:31.494
[Faber]
This is Detective Lincoln.

312
00:14:33.456 --> 00:14:35.999
I'm Detective Faber.

313
00:14:36.126 --> 00:14:38.001
What can we do for you?

314
00:14:38.128 --> 00:14:41.004
Do you all know a Rory Sharma?

315
00:14:41.131 --> 00:14:42.213
Yeah. Why?

316
00:14:42.299 --> 00:14:43.673
[Rena]
Yeah. What's going on?

317
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.509
Mr. Sharma was found dead
in his home last night.

318
00:14:46.636 --> 00:14:48.261
No no. We just saw him.

319
00:14:48.346 --> 00:14:50.680
When...?
What happened?

320
00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:52.557
[Faber]
Suspected poisoning.

321
00:14:52.642 --> 00:14:55.009
Forensics' early screening
showed signs of poison

322
00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:59.230
in the brandy and on a
cigar in the ashtray.

323
00:14:59.316 --> 00:15:01.515
How did you...

324
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.234
[Lincoln]
Fob.

325
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.569
[keys jingle]

326
00:15:04.654 --> 00:15:06.362
We found it in his car.

327
00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:08.531
There's a tag with
this address on it.

328
00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:11.409
And we weren't expecting to
find anyone else here. So...

329
00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:14.537
Yet. here you all are.

330
00:15:16.625 --> 00:15:18.207
[Faber] We'd like to ask
you all a few questions.

331
00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:19.876
Of course.

332
00:15:22.505 --> 00:15:24.205
From the looks of it.

333
00:15:24.299 --> 00:15:26.841
Mr. Sharma was killed
by someone he knew.

334
00:15:26.927 --> 00:15:29.218
[Faber] There was no
signs of forced entry.

335
00:15:32.182 --> 00:15:33.306
What is this?

336
00:15:33.391 --> 00:15:36.434
Some sort of book club?

337
00:15:37.354 --> 00:15:38.478
Yes.

338
00:15:40.148 --> 00:15:42.899
[Faber] When was the last time
you all saw Mr. Sharma?

339
00:15:43.026 --> 00:15:44.734
Last night. At his home.

340
00:15:44.861 --> 00:15:46.444
Before he was killed?

341
00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:49.397
[Gene] Yeah. Rory just bought
a new house

342
00:15:49.491 --> 00:15:52.742
and he was eager to show it off.
so we all went over for drinks.

343
00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:54.735
Did you notice
anything off about him?

344
00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:56.746
He had a heated argument with
someone over the phone...

345
00:15:56.873 --> 00:16:00.291
Well. Rory was always having
heated arguments with someone...

346
00:16:00.377 --> 00:16:03.244
True. Yeah.
He is a bit of a hot head.

347
00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:06.464
He was...
Was...

348
00:16:10.095 --> 00:16:13.721
[Faber] So books.
that's your connection?

349
00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:17.141
Yeah. we are a book club.

350
00:16:17.978 --> 00:16:20.770
And what kind of
books do you read?

351
00:16:20.897 --> 00:16:24.023
Mostly murder mysteries.

352
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:27.768
We'd like to talk to each
one of you individually

353
00:16:27.862 --> 00:16:29.195
if you don't mind.

354
00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.271
[Abby]
Sure.

355
00:16:30.365 --> 00:16:32.365
I can set you up out front.

356
00:16:40.792 --> 00:16:42.875
[Gene] Rory and I didn't
hit it off at first

357
00:16:42.961 --> 00:16:44.502
but I grew to like him.

358
00:16:44.587 --> 00:16:46.546
I considered him a friend.

359
00:16:46.631 --> 00:16:49.007
[Gene] His flashy jewelry
and his novelty ring tones

360
00:16:49.092 --> 00:16:51.551
were a bit much but...

361
00:16:51.636 --> 00:16:54.679
He didn't deserve
to die like that.

362
00:16:54.764 --> 00:16:59.392
[Rena] There was a side to Rory
that most people didn't know.

363
00:16:59.477 --> 00:17:03.479
The sweet side.
the generous side.

364
00:17:03.606 --> 00:17:06.858
[Rena]
He didn't always show it but...

365
00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:11.112
He was a good friend to me.

366
00:17:13.283 --> 00:17:15.825
[Miller] We all left Rory's
house around the same time.

367
00:17:15.952 --> 00:17:19.412
Except Hollis.
She stayed later.

368
00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:23.875
[Abby] I'm not sure how long
Hollis stayed to be honest.

369
00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.711
I thought she left when we did.

370
00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:32.175
Thank you. Ms. Caldwell.

371
00:17:47.025 --> 00:17:49.192
According to your friends.

372
00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:53.187
you stayed and talked to Mr.
Sharma after everyone left.

373
00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:56.023
So what did you talk about?

374
00:17:56.117 --> 00:17:57.867
Cigars.

375
00:17:57.994 --> 00:18:00.828
[Lincoln]
Cigars?

376
00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:03.247
Expensive cigars.

377
00:18:03.333 --> 00:18:07.460
And are you a cigar enthusiast?

378
00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:09.879
No.

379
00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:13.257
[Faber] Did your conversation
with Mr. Sharma

380
00:18:13.343 --> 00:18:17.887
become unpleasant
at any point?

381
00:18:18.014 --> 00:18:19.931
Rory and I were always
known to speak our minds.

382
00:18:20.016 --> 00:18:22.058
We had that kind
of relationship.

383
00:18:22.185 --> 00:18:24.894
[Faber] Did the two of you have
an argument last night?

384
00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:28.773
No.

385
00:18:29.984 --> 00:18:33.227
So where did you go after
you left Mr. Sharma's house?

386
00:18:33.321 --> 00:18:40.067
Let's see. um. I went
home. made a cup of tea.

387
00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:43.204
Chamomile. in case
you're wondering.

388
00:18:45.542 --> 00:18:49.076
[Lincoln] What book are you guys
reading right now?

389
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:52.588
We just finished
"World at Midnight".

390
00:18:52.715 --> 00:18:54.915
[Lincoln]
I should check it out.

391
00:18:55.009 --> 00:18:58.386
Nothing like a good
murder mystery. right?

392
00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:04.642
[Faber] Do you know any of
Mr. Sharma's family?

393
00:19:04.727 --> 00:19:08.104
His friends. maybe
business associates?

394
00:19:08.231 --> 00:19:09.930
He has a...

395
00:19:10.024 --> 00:19:14.318
He had a girlfriend
but I've never met her.

396
00:19:14.404 --> 00:19:16.279
Rory's pretty private.

397
00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:17.530
Yeah. we know about
the girlfriend.

398
00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:20.533
She's the one who
found his body.

399
00:19:20.618 --> 00:19:22.535
Well thank you for
your time. Ms. Morgan.

400
00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:26.581
And if you think
of anything else.

401
00:19:28.251 --> 00:19:29.876
please give me a call.

402
00:19:36.134 --> 00:19:37.717
Sure.

403
00:19:56.613 --> 00:19:58.654
Thanks again. everyone.

404
00:19:58.781 --> 00:20:02.491
And. we're very
sorry for your loss.

405
00:20:16.633 --> 00:20:18.799
Is anyone gonna say it?

406
00:20:19.969 --> 00:20:21.886
Rory was killed just
like the character

407
00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:23.429
in "World at Midnight".

408
00:20:23.514 --> 00:20:24.972
Remember?

409
00:20:25.058 --> 00:20:27.391
Gerald drank from the
poisonous nightcap

410
00:20:27.477 --> 00:20:30.853
while his cigar burned
in the ashtray.

411
00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.481
Does anyone find that strange?

412
00:20:37.987 --> 00:20:42.531
♪ [ominous music] ♪

413
00:20:49.749 --> 00:20:52.116
-[Hollis] Hey...
-[Jeffrey] Hey.

414
00:20:52.418 --> 00:20:54.252
[Hollis]
How are you?

415
00:20:54.337 --> 00:20:57.630
Don't judge me.
I'm old school.

416
00:21:01.594 --> 00:21:04.628
I really thought
I could save you all.

417
00:21:04.722 --> 00:21:06.639
[Hollis]
Jeffrey. don't.

418
00:21:06.766 --> 00:21:08.891
I knew Rory was in trouble.

419
00:21:08.977 --> 00:21:11.060
He was always so
damned secretive.

420
00:21:11.145 --> 00:21:12.270
Yeah.

421
00:21:14.565 --> 00:21:16.023
Um...

422
00:21:16.109 --> 00:21:18.359
When you were putting
the book club together.

423
00:21:18.444 --> 00:21:20.444
did any of the
other members

424
00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:23.239
know me or know
anything about me?

425
00:21:23.324 --> 00:21:25.533
Not that I know of. Why?

426
00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:29.161
[Hollis]
Nothing. Just wondering.

427
00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:31.914
I know this is probably not

428
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.209
the best time to ask about my
expungement statement but...

429
00:21:35.295 --> 00:21:37.328
No. no no no no.

430
00:21:37.422 --> 00:21:40.256
No. Rory would have wanted
us to keep our heads up

431
00:21:40.341 --> 00:21:43.009
and keep moving forward.

432
00:21:44.137 --> 00:21:46.337
So. listen. I read your
letter statement here.

433
00:21:46.431 --> 00:21:47.805
I read it twice. actually.

434
00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:48.723
Yeah?

435
00:21:48.808 --> 00:21:50.516
I cried both times.

436
00:21:50.643 --> 00:21:53.394
It's compelling as hell but

437
00:21:53.479 --> 00:21:55.604
I really think you
need to add something.

438
00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:58.566
like another letter by your mom.
your dad. like your sister.

439
00:21:58.651 --> 00:22:00.109
the distant cousin. somebody...

440
00:22:00.194 --> 00:22:02.853
Jeffrey... You know I
can't ask my family.

441
00:22:02.947 --> 00:22:04.688
I know. I know.

442
00:22:04.782 --> 00:22:06.574
They still blame you for
your ex burning them

443
00:22:06.659 --> 00:22:08.200
on that promissory deal.

444
00:22:08.328 --> 00:22:09.910
But. you know what?
That was a long time ago.

445
00:22:09.996 --> 00:22:12.663
It's time to forgive and forget.

446
00:22:12.749 --> 00:22:14.415
Life is short.

447
00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.292
Ain't that the truth?

448
00:22:16.377 --> 00:22:20.296
So. I bought this when
I heard about Rory.

449
00:22:21.674 --> 00:22:24.216
Oh. Brandy? Ewww.
No no no.

450
00:22:24.344 --> 00:22:25.634
This stuff's good.

451
00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.554
Don't you have a bottle of
wine stashed somewhere?

452
00:22:28.681 --> 00:22:29.972
Ah. no.

453
00:22:30.058 --> 00:22:32.141
I leave wine for the
lightweights like you and Abby.

454
00:22:32.226 --> 00:22:34.769
[laughs] But I'm going to pass.

455
00:22:34.854 --> 00:22:36.437
And I don't want you
to get in trouble

456
00:22:36.522 --> 00:22:38.481
for a few drinks
on the job.

457
00:22:39.359 --> 00:22:40.900
Hollis.

458
00:22:41.027 --> 00:22:44.236
I'm not exactly the rule
follower you think I am.

459
00:22:44.364 --> 00:22:46.447
I find that hard to believe.

460
00:22:47.241 --> 00:22:48.699
I'm going to get
out of here. though.

461
00:22:48.785 --> 00:22:49.700
Okay.

462
00:22:49.786 --> 00:22:50.785
-I love you.
-You too.

463
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:51.952
Thank you.

464
00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:55.790
Psssshh...

465
00:22:55.875 --> 00:22:57.375
-Call you later.
-All right.

466
00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:58.667
Bye.

467
00:23:09.722 --> 00:23:11.639
[Miller] What do we think of
Rory's girlfriend?

468
00:23:11.724 --> 00:23:13.891
[Abby]
Hmm... Okay. I guess.

469
00:23:13.976 --> 00:23:15.726
If like that sort of thing.

470
00:23:15.812 --> 00:23:17.436
[Miller]
I. I do.

471
00:23:17.563 --> 00:23:19.480
[Hollis] I don't know a
single person here.

472
00:23:19.565 --> 00:23:21.649
[Gene] What about her?
What's her name?

473
00:23:21.734 --> 00:23:22.775
[Rena] Oh. I stopped remembering

474
00:23:22.902 --> 00:23:24.777
Rory's girlfriends'
names years ago.

475
00:23:24.904 --> 00:23:26.362
[they all chuckle]

476
00:23:26.447 --> 00:23:28.072
[Hollis] Here she comes!
Here she comes!

477
00:23:32.578 --> 00:23:35.079
You must be Rory's
book club friends.

478
00:23:35.164 --> 00:23:36.705
-Yeah.
-Yes.

479
00:23:36.791 --> 00:23:38.624
[Farrah]
You know. it's so funny.

480
00:23:38.751 --> 00:23:41.085
He used to carry on
about you and the books

481
00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:44.505
but I never actually
saw him read anything.

482
00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:46.006
Sounds about right.

483
00:23:46.092 --> 00:23:47.925
We're so sorry for your loss.

484
00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:49.260
We all really loved Rory...

485
00:23:49.345 --> 00:23:51.512
I. for one. enjoy reading.

486
00:23:51.597 --> 00:23:53.797
Bah! I read all the time.

487
00:23:53.891 --> 00:23:55.683
Oh!

488
00:23:55.768 --> 00:23:59.437
It just kind of feels like I
never even really knew him.

489
00:23:59.522 --> 00:24:03.858
It feels like the last three
weeks didn't even count.

490
00:24:03.943 --> 00:24:04.942
[Hollis chokes]
Excuse me.

491
00:24:05.027 --> 00:24:05.860
[Hollis]
Hmm.

492
00:24:05.945 --> 00:24:07.570
I'm sorry.

493
00:24:07.655 --> 00:24:10.948
Would you guys have any idea who
might've done this to my Rory?

494
00:24:11.033 --> 00:24:13.284
Ah! There you are!

495
00:24:13.369 --> 00:24:14.618
My favorite crew.

496
00:24:14.704 --> 00:24:16.328
Hey!

497
00:24:16.456 --> 00:24:18.330
I'm sorry. Farrah.

498
00:24:18.458 --> 00:24:19.832
Thanks Jeffrey.

499
00:24:21.752 --> 00:24:23.794
Well. excuse me.

500
00:24:24.547 --> 00:24:26.881
Yeah. pleased to meet you.

501
00:24:26.966 --> 00:24:28.549
[Jeffrey]
I wouldn't be a bit surprised

502
00:24:28.634 --> 00:24:30.134
if she thinks one
of you killed Rory.

503
00:24:30.219 --> 00:24:31.385
[All]
What?

504
00:24:31.471 --> 00:24:33.888
But. she thinks Elvis and
Tupac are still alive.

505
00:24:33.973 --> 00:24:35.890
I definitely think
that Elvis is dead.

506
00:24:35.975 --> 00:24:37.016
But Tupac?

507
00:24:37.143 --> 00:24:39.477
For all we know.
Farrah killed Rory.

508
00:24:39.562 --> 00:24:40.895
She's the one who found him.

509
00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:43.564
And her sugar was going
to dry up once they split.

510
00:24:43.649 --> 00:24:45.232
[Rena] How do you know they
were going to split?

511
00:24:46.068 --> 00:24:47.401
You're right. Never mind.

512
00:24:47.487 --> 00:24:49.278
He had so many girlfriends
I couldn't keep up.

513
00:24:49.363 --> 00:24:51.947
That was our Rory.
Life in the fast lane.

514
00:24:53.284 --> 00:24:54.283
Hi!

515
00:24:56.704 --> 00:24:58.245
Hello Michael.

516
00:24:58.331 --> 00:24:59.455
Sorry. I missed the memorial.

517
00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:00.664
No worries.

518
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:02.199
It was short and sweet
and all about Rory.

519
00:25:02.293 --> 00:25:04.001
He would have loved it.

520
00:25:05.004 --> 00:25:07.087
Rena might have been
right about Farrah.

521
00:25:07.173 --> 00:25:08.631
What if it was her?

522
00:25:08.716 --> 00:25:10.883
[Gene]
Her. Or someone like her.

523
00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:14.094
I bet that there's some
clues in this house.

524
00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.388
[Miller]
Something that forensics missed.

525
00:25:16.516 --> 00:25:18.557
And we would know
what to look for.

526
00:25:18.684 --> 00:25:21.435
You know what?
We should split up.

527
00:25:21.521 --> 00:25:22.937
Good idea.

528
00:25:23.022 --> 00:25:25.556
[Jeffrey] No no.
That's not a good idea!

529
00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:28.025
That's a terrible idea.

[scoffs]
Yeah. something like that.

535
00:26:02.562 --> 00:26:04.186
Why didn't you tell
me your book club

536
00:26:04.272 --> 00:26:06.647
is some kind of a support
group for ex-cons.

537
00:26:07.984 --> 00:26:09.608
Because we're not.

538
00:26:09.735 --> 00:26:11.735
We're a book club.

539
00:26:11.821 --> 00:26:14.321

For ex-cons.

Every member has

Three years for insurance fraud.

548
00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.473
You forgot about one.

549
00:26:41.601 --> 00:26:43.892
Ah. that's right.

550
00:26:43.978 --> 00:26:47.980
Abby Caldwell.
Big question mark. that one.

551
00:26:48.107 --> 00:26:49.806
Did you know that Mr. Sharma

552
00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:53.027
saved you in his contacts
as Rebecca Lynley?

553
00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:58.198
One guess from the look on
your face. that answer's a no.

554
00:26:58.284 --> 00:27:01.744
No... I never told him my name.

555
00:27:01.829 --> 00:27:03.746
I didn't know.

556
00:27:03.831 --> 00:27:05.998
Would it surprise you to find
out that you and Mr. Sharma

557
00:27:06.125 --> 00:27:07.750
have a common acquaintance.

558
00:27:07.835 --> 00:27:10.878
that is outside
your book club?

559
00:27:10.963 --> 00:27:13.464
So are you trained to
speak in riddles or what?

560
00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:18.052
Sharma was an associate of
your ex-husband. Ms. Morgan.

What. you don't seem surprised?

564
00:27:26.145 --> 00:27:28.020
Where is Mr. Lynley?

565
00:27:28.147 --> 00:27:30.064
I have no idea.

566
00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:31.523
I am curious though.

567
00:27:31.651 --> 00:27:34.026
What's Bill's
connection to Rory?

568
00:27:34.153 --> 00:27:36.654
That's what we
intend to find out.

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:43.577
You know. it's funny isn't it?

570
00:27:43.663 --> 00:27:47.998
Some people just aren't
what they seem to be.

571
00:28:02.181 --> 00:28:04.306
[Avery] Well. it turns out that

572
00:28:04.392 --> 00:28:06.433
Marla Wilson does
not have a will.

573
00:28:06.519 --> 00:28:08.477
Nor does she have any family.

574
00:28:08.562 --> 00:28:10.062
She wants to sell her
house and move into

575
00:28:10.189 --> 00:28:12.106
an assisted living facility.

576
00:28:12.191 --> 00:28:14.608
So I'm thinking we should maybe
set up a conservatorship?

577
00:28:14.694 --> 00:28:16.110
Yeah. That's a good call.

578
00:28:16.195 --> 00:28:18.228
She may not have much but
no one wants the state

579
00:28:18.322 --> 00:28:20.197
divvying up their assets
when they pass on.

580
00:28:20.282 --> 00:28:21.865
Agreed.

581
00:28:21.951 --> 00:28:23.992
Good. All right. Then we should
get moving on this right away.

582
00:28:24.078 --> 00:28:25.744
Because Marla's still trying
to call the shots but I think

583
00:28:25.871 --> 00:28:28.956
her ability to make sound
decisions is waning a little.

584
00:28:29.041 --> 00:28:30.165
I'm on it!

585
00:28:30.251 --> 00:28:31.291

All right.

It's me. Becka. Um...

590
00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:01.104
I know you don't want
to talk to me...

591
00:29:01.198 --> 00:29:03.991
Can you give me a call?

00:29:04.076 --> 00:29:05.275

593
00:29:05.369 --> 00:29:07.202
I love you. Bye.

594
00:29:23.554 --> 00:29:26.513
Are you here to give me a
critique of the book or...

595
00:29:26.599 --> 00:29:29.767
How and when was this
book club formed?

596
00:29:31.604 --> 00:29:33.312
The truth. Ms. Morgan.

597
00:29:36.442 --> 00:29:39.818
Jeffrey Wallace. parole officer.

598
00:29:39.945 --> 00:29:42.196
See when you're in prison.

599
00:29:42.281 --> 00:29:44.323
you have a lot of
time on your hands.

600
00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:47.484
And reading can sometimes
be a way to escape.

601
00:29:47.578 --> 00:29:49.369
Jeffrey thought the book
club was a good way

602
00:29:49.455 --> 00:29:52.155
to bring us together.
to connect us.

603
00:29:52.249 --> 00:29:53.916
to form a new family even.

604
00:29:54.001 --> 00:29:56.543
And you didn't know Mr. Sharma
prior to meeting in book club?

605
00:29:56.629 --> 00:29:57.878
No.

606
00:29:57.963 --> 00:29:59.671
Do you think any of
the other members

607
00:29:59.799 --> 00:30:03.050
had a reason to want
Mr. Sharma dead?

608
00:30:03.135 --> 00:30:05.093
Sorry. Sorry.
You had to know Rory.

609
00:30:05.179 --> 00:30:07.971
He was annoying as hell but
none of us wanted to kill him.

610
00:30:08.057 --> 00:30:09.348
He was our friend.

611
00:30:09.475 --> 00:30:11.558
How do you explain the
similarities between his death

612
00:30:11.644 --> 00:30:13.343
and the victim in
"World at Midnight"?

613
00:30:13.437 --> 00:30:14.937
It's now been confirmed

614
00:30:15.022 --> 00:30:17.397
that the poison was on the tip
of the cigar and in the glass.

615
00:30:17.483 --> 00:30:19.316
Just like in the book.

616
00:30:19.401 --> 00:30:20.901
Okay. What do you
want me to say?

617
00:30:20.986 --> 00:30:22.945
You know. people kill people.

618
00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:25.856
Sometimes they use guns.
sometimes they use knives.

619
00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:27.825
sometimes they use poison.

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:29.576
-Who chose this book?
-I did.

621
00:30:29.662 --> 00:30:31.745
Why? Am I a suspect?

622
00:30:31.831 --> 00:30:33.288
Everyone's a suspect.

623
00:30:33.374 --> 00:30:34.706
Am I in danger?

624
00:30:34.834 --> 00:30:36.416
Not unless you think there's
a serial killer out there

625
00:30:36.502 --> 00:30:38.043
targeting people in book clubs?

626
00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:40.128
Is there?

627
00:30:41.298 --> 00:30:43.423
What did you mean everyone's
a suspect. Detective?

628
00:30:43.509 --> 00:30:44.591
[Lincoln]
If you don't mind.

629
00:30:44.677 --> 00:30:45.843
we'll be the ones
asking the questions.

630
00:30:45.928 --> 00:30:47.010
Actually. I kind of do mind

631
00:30:47.096 --> 00:30:48.595
especially if I'm being
accused of murder.

632
00:30:48.681 --> 00:30:51.056
Motive and opportunity.
to answer your question.

633
00:30:51.183 --> 00:30:52.716
What are you talking about?
I've known Rory for years.

634
00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:54.977
Why would I suddenly
decide to poison him?

635
00:30:55.062 --> 00:30:57.104
We just found out that you and
your husband sold worthless

636
00:30:57.189 --> 00:30:59.064
promissory notes to dozens of
people causing them to lose

637
00:30:59.191 --> 00:31:01.692
hundreds of
thousands of dollars.

638
00:31:01.777 --> 00:31:04.862
That was my ex-husband's
insurance company.

639
00:31:04.947 --> 00:31:07.322
But you set up the company and
you signed off on the documents.

640
00:31:07.408 --> 00:31:09.575
Where did your husband come up
with the idea for that scam?

641
00:31:09.702 --> 00:31:13.120
Bill had a way of finding
shortcuts to wealth.

642
00:31:13.205 --> 00:31:15.622
So. could Rory have been
one of those shortcuts?

643
00:31:15.708 --> 00:31:16.957
I don't know.

644
00:31:17.042 --> 00:31:19.793
Like I said. Rory had some
cigars. they were rare.

645
00:31:19.879 --> 00:31:22.462
My ex-husband had
some like them once.

646
00:31:22.548 --> 00:31:23.922
Yeah. once.

647
00:31:24.049 --> 00:31:26.383
When was the last time you
saw or spoke to Mr. Lynley?

648
00:31:26.468 --> 00:31:28.010
[Hollis]
Eight years ago.

649
00:31:28.095 --> 00:31:30.637
When my guilty verdict was
handed down. he shrugged.

650
00:31:30.723 --> 00:31:31.972
walked out of
the courtroom.

651
00:31:32.057 --> 00:31:34.725
And I have not heard
from him since.

652
00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:37.227
You know. Ms. Morgan...

653
00:31:37.313 --> 00:31:40.647
I can't say I'd blame
you for being upset.

654
00:31:40.733 --> 00:31:43.817
Learning that your husband
betrayed you and your friend.

655
00:31:43.903 --> 00:31:45.694
While they're out
living the good life.

smoking expensive cigars.

657
00:31:49.617 --> 00:31:52.451
You're in prison reading books.

658
00:31:52.578 --> 00:31:54.119
I didn't kill him.

659
00:31:54.246 --> 00:31:55.954
Good try. though.

660
00:31:56.081 --> 00:31:57.331
Why don't you tell us
what happened that night

661
00:31:57.416 --> 00:31:59.282
after everyone left.

662
00:31:59.376 --> 00:32:00.626
Ah. let's see.

663
00:32:00.753 --> 00:32:03.712
Rory and I talked
about the cigars.

664
00:32:03.797 --> 00:32:05.455
He wouldn't tell me
where he got them.

665
00:32:05.549 --> 00:32:08.792
He got a phone call and he went
outside to talk in private.

666
00:32:08.886 --> 00:32:11.511
[Lincoln] So you were left alone
in the living room.

667
00:32:11.597 --> 00:32:15.098
With the brandy and the
cigar in the ashtray.

668
00:32:15.184 --> 00:32:16.516
Yes.

669
00:32:16.602 --> 00:32:17.726
Then what happened?

670
00:32:17.811 --> 00:32:20.354
He came back.
I told him I had to go.

671
00:32:20.439 --> 00:32:22.689
We had a conversation
that was going nowhere.

672
00:32:22.775 --> 00:32:24.858
It was upsetting...

673
00:32:24.944 --> 00:32:27.069
Not upsetting. It was...

674
00:32:27.154 --> 00:32:29.988
Did he make you angry?

675
00:32:30.115 --> 00:32:32.866
He walked me to
my car and I left.

676
00:32:32.952 --> 00:32:35.243
That's it.

677
00:32:35.329 --> 00:32:37.371
It's motive.

678
00:32:37.456 --> 00:32:39.831
Opportunity.

679
00:32:44.463 --> 00:32:46.830
Are we done?

680
00:32:46.924 --> 00:32:48.215
Yes.

681
00:32:49.051 --> 00:32:51.218
Thank you for your
time. Ms. Morgan.

682
00:32:54.223 --> 00:32:56.014

Ahh. Coffee.

Nope. Your favorite.

Hot tea.

688
00:33:24.962 --> 00:33:27.754
[chuckles] I'm impressed.
How did you know?

689
00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.040
A good attorney pays attention.

690
00:33:30.134 --> 00:33:32.542
Perfect!

691
00:33:32.636 --> 00:33:35.211
I know you've been
through a lot. Hollis.

692
00:33:35.305 --> 00:33:38.598
And. I just want you to
know that I'm here for you.

693
00:33:38.684 --> 00:33:40.550
If for nothing more
than to bring you

694
00:33:40.644 --> 00:33:42.269
a cup of tea every
now and then.

695
00:33:42.354 --> 00:33:44.104
[laughs]
Thank you.

696
00:33:44.189 --> 00:33:45.564
Of course.

697
00:33:45.691 --> 00:33:48.567
So. I did a little digging
into Mrs. Wilson's affairs.

698
00:33:48.694 --> 00:33:50.110
Oh yeah? What did you find?

699
00:33:50.195 --> 00:33:51.945
Well. turns out she
owns a lot more

700
00:33:52.031 --> 00:33:54.406
than a dusty old house and
an old spoon collection.

701
00:33:56.952 --> 00:34:00.620
Wow! She has some
serious bank!

702
00:34:00.706 --> 00:34:02.205
Is that right?

703
00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:07.627
All the more reason to get
moving on that conservatorship.

704
00:34:07.713 --> 00:34:12.299
Well. I also looked into her
son. like you asked. Hollis.

705
00:34:12.384 --> 00:34:14.426
She told me she didn't
have any family.

706
00:34:14.553 --> 00:34:16.261
She and her son are at odds

707
00:34:16.388 --> 00:34:18.138
so I thought if I could
bring them together.

708
00:34:18.223 --> 00:34:20.474
we might not have to put her
under that conservatorship.

709
00:34:20.559 --> 00:34:21.975
-That would be ideal.
-Yeah.

710
00:34:22.061 --> 00:34:24.269
His name is Conroy Wilson.
Lives in Charlotte.

711
00:34:24.396 --> 00:34:27.105
Did she tell you
that he's an ex-con?

712
00:34:27.232 --> 00:34:28.940
Yeah.

713
00:34:29.068 --> 00:34:31.485
That explains why she wants
nothing to do with him.

714
00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:33.653
Anyway. all of the numbers I
have for him aren't working

715
00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:34.988
but I'll keep trying.

716
00:34:35.074 --> 00:34:37.282
Yeah. okay.
Nice work. Mark.

717
00:34:40.579 --> 00:34:41.828
You okay?

718
00:34:41.914 --> 00:34:44.206
Oh. Yeah. I'm good.
I just...

719
00:34:44.291 --> 00:34:49.920
I haven't been able to
reconcile with my own family so.

720
00:34:50.005 --> 00:34:55.467
hey. maybe there's hope
for Marla and Conroy. Right?

721
00:34:58.097 --> 00:35:00.514
You have a good heart. Hollis.

722
00:35:00.599 --> 00:35:02.849
And you have my full support.

723
00:35:02.935 --> 00:35:05.310
Just let me know how I can help.

724
00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:09.064
Can I ask you a question?

725
00:35:09.149 --> 00:35:14.402
Why did you hire me
knowing that I was a felon?

726
00:35:15.948 --> 00:35:18.648
One. you were honest with me.

727
00:35:18.742 --> 00:35:22.536
Two. I believe your
ex-husband abused your trust.

728
00:35:22.621 --> 00:35:25.413
And three.
you're brilliant.

729
00:35:25.499 --> 00:35:29.376
Oh. and four. I believe
in second chances.

730
00:35:29.461 --> 00:35:31.169
Thank you.

731
00:35:31.296 --> 00:35:35.590
Well. in that case. I think I
should tell you that I'm filing

732
00:35:35.676 --> 00:35:38.009
a petition to have
my record expunged.

733
00:35:38.137 --> 00:35:41.972
Would you be willing to write a
letter of recommendation for me?

734
00:35:42.057 --> 00:35:45.016
Are you kidding?
I would be honored.

735
00:35:45.144 --> 00:35:49.688
You're gonna make an
amazing attorney. Hollis.

736
00:35:49.815 --> 00:35:51.982
Maybe you'll be
hiring me someday.

737
00:35:58.323 --> 00:35:59.906
[Hollis] Okay guys.
What do we have?

738
00:35:59.992 --> 00:36:02.033
Well. let's start with
Rory's fancy new house.

739
00:36:02.161 --> 00:36:06.246
Turns out he paid cash for it.
$500.000 over asking.

740
00:36:06.331 --> 00:36:08.790
Price tag on that
baby was $3.5 million.

741
00:36:08.876 --> 00:36:10.366
[Gene]
Whoa!

742
00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:12.294
Sounds like he had some money
burning a hole in his pocket.

743
00:36:12.379 --> 00:36:14.171
Maybe it was dirty money.

744
00:36:14.256 --> 00:36:15.630
Maybe he was
helping to clean it.

745
00:36:15.716 --> 00:36:16.923
Who would he be laundering for?

746
00:36:17.009 --> 00:36:19.050
Pick a con. any con.

747
00:36:19.178 --> 00:36:21.511
Ah. I looked into
his financials and

748
00:36:21.597 --> 00:36:23.471
he had bank accounts
all over the place.

749
00:36:23.557 --> 00:36:25.765
Here. Switzerland. Paris.

750
00:36:25.851 --> 00:36:27.726
And no less than a million
dollars in each one.

751
00:36:27.853 --> 00:36:28.852
What?

752
00:36:29.688 --> 00:36:31.221
What do you have Gene?

753
00:36:31.315 --> 00:36:34.441
Ah. well. it turns out that our
suspicions that Rory was a loner

754
00:36:34.526 --> 00:36:36.151
turned out to be true.

755
00:36:36.236 --> 00:36:37.861
The only people
in his life.

756
00:36:37.946 --> 00:36:39.613
other than his trophy
girlfriends.

757
00:36:39.698 --> 00:36:42.490
seemed to be a few
business associates and us.

758
00:36:42.576 --> 00:36:44.492
Who were all the
people at the memorial?

759
00:36:44.578 --> 00:36:46.494
Were they paid actors?

760
00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:48.496
[Gene]
Said trophy's friends.

761
00:36:49.875 --> 00:36:52.167
Where was Rory
getting this money?

762
00:36:52.252 --> 00:36:54.169
Drugs? Smuggling goods
across the border?

763
00:36:54.254 --> 00:36:57.413
Trafficking?
All of the above.

764
00:36:57.507 --> 00:36:59.424
What about his
international connections?

765
00:36:59.551 --> 00:37:01.426
None of my contacts knew
anything about him.

766
00:37:01.553 --> 00:37:03.511
Not that they would admit.

767
00:37:03.597 --> 00:37:05.388
Maybe he was an escort.

768
00:37:07.893 --> 00:37:08.975
I'm kidding.

769
00:37:09.061 --> 00:37:11.928
He was probably a
drug dealer. right?

770
00:37:12.022 --> 00:37:14.981
I know Rory had a history.

771
00:37:15.067 --> 00:37:17.984
I don't see. I don't see Bill
being involved with drugs.

772
00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:19.903
But then again. I didn't
see him selling me out.

773
00:37:19.988 --> 00:37:21.696
So there it is...

774
00:37:21.782 --> 00:37:25.158
Where are with finding
the elusive ex?

775
00:37:25.244 --> 00:37:27.953
I have yet to open that
can of worms. But I will.

776
00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:30.455
Let me know if I
can be of any help.

777
00:37:30.582 --> 00:37:32.499
Oh. Since you're offering.

778
00:37:32.584 --> 00:37:36.211
can you find out more about
these promissory note schemes?

779
00:37:36.296 --> 00:37:38.838
There may be others who helped
Bill set up these dummy accounts

780
00:37:38.924 --> 00:37:41.675
and I wanna have all the
info by the time I see him.

781
00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.594
Oh. Gene. What about your
attorney general friend?

782
00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:46.554
Doesn't he prosecute
cases like that?

783
00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:49.432
You mean former attorney
general and friend

784
00:37:49.518 --> 00:37:50.850
who got off without
answering for his crimes

785
00:37:50.936 --> 00:37:53.270
because yours truly lied on
his behalf. went to prison

786
00:37:53.355 --> 00:37:56.356
and came out with a criminal
record and a broken heart?

787
00:37:56.441 --> 00:37:58.984
Yes. That one.

788
00:37:59.778 --> 00:38:01.644
[whispers]
Stop it!

789
00:38:01.738 --> 00:38:03.697
If you're not comfortable
talking to him...

790
00:38:03.782 --> 00:38:05.031
I'll take one
for the team.

791
00:38:05.117 --> 00:38:06.491
Thank you.

792
00:38:06.618 --> 00:38:08.660
And not a word about any of
this to Faber and Lincoln.

793
00:38:08.787 --> 00:38:10.537
Okay? We have to stay
two steps ahead of them.

794
00:38:10.622 --> 00:38:12.414
How hard can that be?

795
00:38:12.499 --> 00:38:13.331
[chuckling]

796
00:38:13.458 --> 00:38:15.083
Oh and speaking of the cops.

797
00:38:15.168 --> 00:38:19.254
Will they uncover any dealings
that any of you had with Rory?

798
00:38:19.339 --> 00:38:20.830
It's bad enough
they're targeting me.

799
00:38:20.924 --> 00:38:23.091
I don't want them
coming after all of us.

800
00:38:24.511 --> 00:38:26.886
No? Nothing?

801
00:38:26.972 --> 00:38:29.931
Well. his fashion choices nearly
sent me into a fit of rage

802
00:38:30.017 --> 00:38:31.141
but I didn't kill him!

803
00:38:31.226 --> 00:38:32.350
[everyone laughs]

804
00:38:32.477 --> 00:38:34.510
Okay. well if that is
all then I have to go.

805
00:38:34.604 --> 00:38:36.021
Michael is waiting for me.

806
00:38:36.148 --> 00:38:38.231
Oh guys oh!
One more thing. okay.

807
00:38:38.317 --> 00:38:40.734
Please be careful. All right.

808
00:38:40.819 --> 00:38:42.694
We don't know who
killed Rory or why.

809
00:38:42.821 --> 00:38:44.738
which means we also
don't know if one of us

810
00:38:44.823 --> 00:38:47.407
could be the next target.

811
00:38:47.492 --> 00:38:49.743
Murder by association.

812
00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:12.432
[Hollis chuckles] Miller I love
what you've done with the place.

813
00:39:26.573 --> 00:39:29.074
I made copies of all of
this on to flash drives

814
00:39:29.201 --> 00:39:31.659
but I've also printed out
hard copies for you and Gene.

815
00:39:31.745 --> 00:39:34.162
Okay. Thank you.

816
00:39:34.247 --> 00:39:36.623
That is a lot of books.

817
00:39:36.708 --> 00:39:38.875
Don't tell me you've read
every single one of them.

818
00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.377
No.

819
00:39:41.296 --> 00:39:43.413
No. I'm kidding.
I've read all of them.

820
00:39:43.507 --> 00:39:45.673
[laughs]
Yeah.

821
00:39:45.759 --> 00:39:48.051
Okay. so...

822
00:39:48.136 --> 00:39:52.755
Did anything in Rory's bank
records strike you as odd?

823
00:39:52.849 --> 00:39:54.307
Other than the fact
that he spent money

824
00:39:54.393 --> 00:39:56.017
like he had an
endless supply?

825
00:39:56.103 --> 00:39:59.312
Maybe he did. But where
did it come from?

826
00:39:59.398 --> 00:40:01.398
Everywhere.

827
00:40:01.483 --> 00:40:04.484
Mostly wire transfers.
big amounts. small amounts.

828
00:40:04.569 --> 00:40:06.277
domestic. international.

829
00:40:06.405 --> 00:40:08.154
He was kind of all
over the place.

830
00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:10.407
Hmm. Okay.

831
00:40:11.827 --> 00:40:13.618
Well. thank you for this.

832
00:40:13.745 --> 00:40:15.445
I will go over it tonight.

833
00:40:15.539 --> 00:40:17.330
I appreciate it.

834
00:40:19.126 --> 00:40:20.834
What?

835
00:40:20.919 --> 00:40:24.712
I know that Rory was
blackmailing you.

836
00:40:24.798 --> 00:40:26.622
Where'd you get that idea?

837
00:40:26.716 --> 00:40:29.217
At one of the meetings. he
pointed in your direction

838
00:40:29.302 --> 00:40:33.430
and he said that he
had something on you.

839
00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:35.181
You know...

840
00:40:35.267 --> 00:40:38.935
She's going to owe me big time.

841
00:40:43.108 --> 00:40:45.567
You don't have to admit it.

842
00:40:45.652 --> 00:40:48.111
I won't say anything.

843
00:40:48.196 --> 00:40:52.115
I mean. even if you.
even if you killed Rory.

844
00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.817
I wouldn't tell a soul.

845
00:40:54.911 --> 00:40:59.489
Miller. I didn't kill him.
but thank you for that.

846
00:40:59.583 --> 00:41:01.666
I think.

847
00:41:01.793 --> 00:41:05.962
And um. Rory was not
blackmailing me.

848
00:41:07.132 --> 00:41:09.340
Then who was he talking about?

849
00:41:10.469 --> 00:41:12.001
Thank you for the books
and everything love.

850
00:41:12.095 --> 00:41:14.179
I appreciate it.

851
00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:17.056
That wasn't an answer.

852
00:41:26.902 --> 00:41:29.352
[Hollis] Oh! So are we
day drinking now?

853
00:41:29.446 --> 00:41:31.362
[Abby laughs] I'm in between
showings. Don't judge me.

854
00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:33.531
I'm just saying. You could
have ordered for me!

855
00:41:33.658 --> 00:41:35.191
No. I'm good.
Don't worry about it.

856
00:41:35.285 --> 00:41:36.743
I'm just going to
go straight in.

857
00:41:36.828 --> 00:41:40.413
So. um. was Rory
blackmailing you?

858
00:41:42.501 --> 00:41:45.701
Because Miller said Rory pointed
at me during one of the meetings

859
00:41:45.795 --> 00:41:47.337
and said he 'had something'.

860
00:41:47.422 --> 00:41:49.872
But he was actually talking
about you. wasn't he?

861
00:41:49.966 --> 00:41:51.674
I don't know what he was...

862
00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:53.051
Did he dig up something
from your past?

863
00:41:53.178 --> 00:41:54.761
Something Michael
doesn't know about?

864
00:41:54.846 --> 00:41:57.639
Okay. Look. I've done a lot of
things that I'm not proud of.

865
00:41:57.724 --> 00:42:00.391
They seemed necessary
at the time. but...

866
00:42:00.519 --> 00:42:02.393
I've been there.
I've done that.

867
00:42:02.521 --> 00:42:05.230
I lived in Seattle
before I came here.

868
00:42:05.357 --> 00:42:07.982
I went to prison
because I was greedy.

869
00:42:08.068 --> 00:42:11.561
Theft by deception. fraud.
call it whatever you want.

870
00:42:11.655 --> 00:42:13.112
That doesn't sound like you.

871
00:42:13.198 --> 00:42:15.406
You don't know the
person I used to be.

872
00:42:15.534 --> 00:42:18.326
I ran through every penny I
had and eventually I started

873
00:42:18.411 --> 00:42:21.079
thinking of ways to take
in other people's money.

874
00:42:21.206 --> 00:42:23.873
When I got out I
wanted a clean slate.

875
00:42:23.959 --> 00:42:26.751
I got a fresh start with a
little help from a friend.

876
00:42:26.878 --> 00:42:29.963
-Yes. Jeffrey.
-Yep.

877
00:42:30.048 --> 00:42:33.583
He introduced me to Michael
and we married within a year.

878
00:42:33.677 --> 00:42:35.593
So how much of your
past does Michael know?

879
00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.679
Not as much as Rory.

880
00:42:37.764 --> 00:42:40.098
If he knew everything.
it would destroy him.

881
00:42:40.225 --> 00:42:41.558
It would destroy us.

882
00:42:41.643 --> 00:42:43.101
So. okay. Let me
get this straight.

883
00:42:43.228 --> 00:42:44.978
-You and Rory were friends...
-Uh huh.

884
00:42:45.063 --> 00:42:47.105
And all this time he
was blackmailing you?

885
00:42:47.232 --> 00:42:49.274
More like threatening
to blackmail me.

886
00:42:49.401 --> 00:42:50.766
Isn't that blackmail?

887
00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:53.111
Okay. with Rory it's a little
hard to tell sometimes.

888
00:42:53.238 --> 00:42:54.696
That's true.

889
00:42:54.781 --> 00:42:57.240
Anyway. I wasn't about to let
him drive me away from the club.

890
00:42:57.325 --> 00:43:00.201
You guys are the only family
I have. besides Michael.

891
00:43:00.287 --> 00:43:02.111
Listen...

892
00:43:02.205 --> 00:43:04.280
I went back to the house
the night he was killed.

893
00:43:04.374 --> 00:43:06.616
thinking I could finally
convince him to stop milking me

894
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:08.451
for cash.

895
00:43:08.545 --> 00:43:09.952
When I approached the house.

896
00:43:10.046 --> 00:43:12.288
I saw another car peeling
out of the driveway.

897
00:43:12.382 --> 00:43:14.340
Might have been the killer!

898
00:43:14.426 --> 00:43:17.135
Actually. it was you.

899
00:43:17.262 --> 00:43:20.013
Yeah. You were acting
so strange when we left

900
00:43:20.098 --> 00:43:21.964
I thought something had
gone down between you two

901
00:43:22.058 --> 00:43:24.475
so I changed my mind
and I went home.

902
00:43:24.603 --> 00:43:26.519
Abby. you have to
tell the police.

903
00:43:26.605 --> 00:43:28.438
And further implicate you?

904
00:43:28.523 --> 00:43:30.148
If they found out you've been
withholding information.

905
00:43:30.275 --> 00:43:31.649
you could be in trouble.

906
00:43:31.776 --> 00:43:35.820
I'll be fine.
I always am.

907
00:43:46.374 --> 00:43:49.459
[phone ringing]

908
00:43:53.465 --> 00:43:55.465
Hi Michael. What's up?

909
00:43:57.469 --> 00:43:58.926
What?

910
00:43:59.971 --> 00:44:02.004
Listen. Don't do anything.

911
00:44:02.098 --> 00:44:03.339
Don't call the police.
Do nothing.

912
00:44:03.433 --> 00:44:05.683
I'm. I'm on my way
over right now.

913
00:44:09.439 --> 00:44:11.180
Yes. I need to see
Detective Faber please.

914
00:44:11.274 --> 00:44:14.150
Ms. Morgan.
What can I do for you?

915
00:44:14.235 --> 00:44:17.111
One of the book club
members is missing.

916
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:34.212
So Abigail Caldwell's husband
found this in the driveway.

917
00:44:34.339 --> 00:44:35.705
How is it relevant?

918
00:44:35.799 --> 00:44:38.383
Because in one of our previous
books. "Cheat the Storm."

919
00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:41.969
someone was strangled
with a scarf.

920
00:44:42.055 --> 00:44:45.047
Are you saying you think
Abby Caldwell is dead?

921
00:44:45.141 --> 00:44:47.725
No. I don't know.

922
00:44:47.852 --> 00:44:49.051
[Faber] And no one else
from the club

923
00:44:49.145 --> 00:44:50.728
has spoken to her recently?

924
00:44:50.855 --> 00:44:53.314
No. Just me.

925
00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:56.892
Last book club member
to see Mr. Sharma alive.

926
00:44:56.986 --> 00:44:59.395
[Lincoln] Last member to
talk to Mrs. Caldwell.

927
00:44:59.489 --> 00:45:01.114
I'm seeing a bit
of a pattern here.

928
00:45:01.199 --> 00:45:03.616
[Faber]
Were you and Abby on good terms?

929
00:45:03.702 --> 00:45:05.618
Yes. Abby was my friend.

930
00:45:05.704 --> 00:45:07.370
And so was Rory.

931
00:45:07.455 --> 00:45:10.623
Well. maybe 'your friend'
suspected you were a killer.

932
00:45:10.709 --> 00:45:12.625
Maybe you killed her
to keep her quiet.

933
00:45:12.711 --> 00:45:14.127
Okay. that's it.

934
00:45:14.212 --> 00:45:15.503
That is it!

935
00:45:15.588 --> 00:45:17.130
I've had it with your
half-baked theories about me

936
00:45:17.215 --> 00:45:18.881
being some sort of
raging murderer!

937
00:45:18.967 --> 00:45:22.301
If you're going to charge
me with a crime. charge me!

938
00:45:22.387 --> 00:45:23.753
Maybe we will!

939
00:45:23.847 --> 00:45:24.929
Go ahead!
There's nothing here...

940
00:45:25.056 --> 00:45:26.431
[Faber] You're free
to go. Ms. Morgan.

941
00:45:26.558 --> 00:45:28.850
You are free to go. Ms. Morgan.

942
00:45:30.562 --> 00:45:34.397
We'll put Mrs. Caldwell's info
into the system. Thank you.

943
00:45:35.066 --> 00:45:36.149
Thank you.

944
00:45:40.739 --> 00:45:44.282
You don't really think I'm a
murderer. do you Detective?

945
00:45:44.409 --> 00:45:49.328
What does it matter what I think
as much as what I can prove.

946
00:45:49.414 --> 00:45:52.081
So no? Right?

947
00:45:53.585 --> 00:45:58.045
[door opens. closes]

948
00:45:59.549 --> 00:46:01.299
We should arrest her for
having a smart mouth.

949
00:46:01.426 --> 00:46:03.342
Yeah. well it doesn't
work that way.

950
00:46:03.428 --> 00:46:07.054
Look it. can you just
dial it back a bit.

951
00:46:09.517 --> 00:46:12.310
Let's reach out to a few
more of Rory's acquaintances.

952
00:46:12.437 --> 00:46:14.562
Bring them in for questioning.

953
00:46:17.859 --> 00:46:20.318
[Faber] So you and Rory were
lovers a few months ago?

954
00:46:20.445 --> 00:46:21.861
[Lincoln] Did you ever
meet his family?

955
00:46:21.946 --> 00:46:23.571
What did he tell you
he did for a living?

956
00:46:23.656 --> 00:46:24.980
[Lincoln] Is it true that
you owed Rory money?

957
00:46:25.074 --> 00:46:27.283
When was the last time
you saw Rory alive?

958
00:46:27.368 --> 00:46:28.993
Where were you on the
night he was killed?

959
00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:30.986
So how long have you known Rory?

960
00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:32.622
[A.J.] I met him about
10 years ago

961
00:46:32.707 --> 00:46:34.707
when he was trying to break
into the film industry.

962
00:46:34.793 --> 00:46:37.835
I was an aspiring
producer at the time.

963
00:46:37.962 --> 00:46:39.879
[A.J.] He always just flew
by the seat of his pants

964
00:46:39.964 --> 00:46:43.341
yet somehow always
managed to make money.

965
00:46:43.468 --> 00:46:45.426
Like a lot of money!

966
00:46:45.512 --> 00:46:47.970
How would you
describe Mr. Sharma?

967
00:46:48.056 --> 00:46:49.055
[A.J. scoffs]
Describe?

968
00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:51.224
He was a big show-off.

969
00:46:51.309 --> 00:46:53.601
And I remember this one good
thing about him. though.

970
00:46:53.686 --> 00:46:58.397
He. um. he said there
was this woman that

971
00:46:58.483 --> 00:47:01.025
went down for one of
the scams he pulled.

972
00:47:01.152 --> 00:47:02.852
[A.J.]
He regretted it.

973
00:47:02.946 --> 00:47:05.530
Said he wanted to
make it up to her.

974
00:47:11.955 --> 00:47:14.205
[Gene]
So. um...

975
00:47:14.332 --> 00:47:16.699
I did a deep dive
into Rory's cohorts.

976
00:47:16.793 --> 00:47:20.035
Went years back in his social
media accounts. contacts.

977
00:47:20.129 --> 00:47:22.255
and emails. thanks to
Miller. by the way.

978
00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:25.258
Lots of calls from
unknown numbers.

979
00:47:25.343 --> 00:47:26.884
Burner phones?

980
00:47:27.011 --> 00:47:28.511
Uh huh. Most likely.

981
00:47:28.596 --> 00:47:29.720
Um...

982
00:47:29.848 --> 00:47:33.391
There's one number that
showed up repeatedly.

983
00:47:33.518 --> 00:47:36.102
It belongs to someone you know.

984
00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:40.857
Bill?

985
00:47:42.652 --> 00:47:44.777
Hollis...

986
00:47:44.863 --> 00:47:47.405
Do you think
Bill killed Rory?

987
00:47:47.532 --> 00:47:50.283
Is he capable?

988
00:47:50.368 --> 00:47:52.401
No. I don't think... No.

989
00:47:52.495 --> 00:47:55.454
Maybe he had someone
do it for him?

990
00:47:55.540 --> 00:48:00.910
Or Rory double crossed him or
threatened to roll over on him?

991
00:48:01.004 --> 00:48:04.747
Look. I know you don't
wanna talk to the guy

992
00:48:04.841 --> 00:48:09.760
but you can't keep
putting it off.

993
00:48:09.888 --> 00:48:15.308
How long did it take you
to forgive your friend?

994
00:48:15.393 --> 00:48:16.559
[Gene scoffs]

995
00:48:18.062 --> 00:48:20.855
Who says I forgave him?

996
00:48:23.568 --> 00:48:29.605
You know. as bad as prison
was. and it was hell.

997
00:48:29.699 --> 00:48:34.619
it wasn't nearly as bad as
being betrayed and abandoned

998
00:48:34.746 --> 00:48:37.371
by someone you love.

999
00:48:39.208 --> 00:48:41.751
Tell me about it.

1000
00:48:57.101 --> 00:48:58.643
[knocking]

1001
00:49:09.072 --> 00:49:11.781
How long have you
known Rory Sharma?

1002
00:49:14.994 --> 00:49:16.869
Okay Becky. look.

1003
00:49:16.955 --> 00:49:18.988
I just want you to know

1004
00:49:19.082 --> 00:49:22.333
I never meant for you to
take the fall in this.

1005
00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:23.542
I didn't...

1006
00:49:23.628 --> 00:49:26.545
Did you guys do business
up until he was killed?

1007
00:49:26.631 --> 00:49:30.675
Okay. I met Rory
a few years ago.

1008
00:49:30.802 --> 00:49:33.719
He approached me with
a business proposition.

1009
00:49:33.805 --> 00:49:37.473
He said he was working with
some dude named Achilles.

1010
00:49:37.558 --> 00:49:42.353
We teamed up. and we
made a lot of money.

1011
00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:44.230
And then we got caught and...

1012
00:49:44.315 --> 00:49:45.856
You mean I got caught.

1013
00:49:45.984 --> 00:49:48.901
Rory assured me that
everything would work out.

1014
00:49:48.987 --> 00:49:52.321
See without a record. you
wouldn't do a day inside.

1015
00:49:52.407 --> 00:49:54.281
let alone a full sentence.

1016
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:58.035
Do you know that. um...

1017
00:49:58.162 --> 00:50:02.039
I'm a suspect in
Rory's murder?

1018
00:50:02.166 --> 00:50:03.916
That's why I'm here.

1019
00:50:04.002 --> 00:50:06.502
To protect you.

1020
00:50:06.587 --> 00:50:08.963
Protect me from who. what?

1021
00:50:09.048 --> 00:50:12.425
Achilles.
And his men.

1022
00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:14.677
Rory pissed them off.

1023
00:50:14.762 --> 00:50:16.220
How?

1024
00:50:16.347 --> 00:50:18.014
He tried to pressure Achilles

1025
00:50:18.099 --> 00:50:20.474
into making him
an equal partner.

1026
00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:23.394
So I'm pretty sure Achilles
is the one who killed him

1027
00:50:23.521 --> 00:50:25.563
but he's trying to make
it look like you did.

1028
00:50:25.690 --> 00:50:28.274
Or somebody from your book club.

1029
00:50:28.359 --> 00:50:30.609
Anything else?

1030
00:50:30.695 --> 00:50:33.195
I can help you. Becky.

1031
00:50:33.281 --> 00:50:36.907
I know how these men
operate. and I know you.

1032
00:50:37.035 --> 00:50:38.451
I know you're not
going to stop until

1033
00:50:38.536 --> 00:50:40.069
you get to the
bottom of this.

1034
00:50:40.163 --> 00:50:43.247
But they may kill you
before you get there.

1035
00:50:43.374 --> 00:50:45.499
And you're going to protect me?

1036
00:50:51.049 --> 00:50:53.966
Come with me. Becky.

1037
00:50:54.052 --> 00:50:56.594
I can take you where
nobody can find you.

1038
00:50:56.721 --> 00:51:01.348
Not the police. not
Achilles. nobody.

1039
00:51:03.644 --> 00:51:07.563
Why not just tell the police
what you just told me?

1040
00:51:11.069 --> 00:51:13.652
You know I can't do that. okay.

1041
00:51:13.738 --> 00:51:17.823
Not without implicating myself.

1042
00:51:19.452 --> 00:51:20.910
I see.

1043
00:51:27.043 --> 00:51:30.044
Becky. if you'd
just listen to me.

1044
00:51:34.592 --> 00:51:36.801
You can go.

1045
00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:42.515

poison was already in the wine

that was swapped out for the
wine that was at Gerald's house.

were poisoned beforehand

01:12:08.033 --> 01:12:09.615
It was good. right?
[chuckles]

1396
01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:14.287
But he did help me out.

1397
01:12:16.333 --> 01:12:18.624
[Rena] What is this?
What's going on?

1398
01:12:19.544 --> 01:12:22.295
Well. the other day you
said something about

1399
01:12:22.422 --> 01:12:26.966
how you always dreamed of
having your own clothing line.

1400
01:12:27.093 --> 01:12:32.680
And I thought. well. starting a
business takes a lot of money.

1401
01:12:32.766 --> 01:12:36.517
So...
Here's a lot of money.

1402
01:12:38.688 --> 01:12:40.688
Is this a joke?

1403
01:12:40.774 --> 01:12:44.642
The only thing I ask as your
silent partner slash investor.

1404
01:12:44.736 --> 01:12:48.529
is that you make me a custom
suit every now and then.

1405
01:12:48.615 --> 01:12:50.823
Maybe a few shirts.

1406
01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:53.451
I mean. what is this?
Like a million bucks.

1407
01:12:53.536 --> 01:12:55.495
Give or take.

1408
01:12:55.622 --> 01:12:57.997
Rory. no.
This is too much

1409
01:12:58.124 --> 01:13:00.541
It's going to take me
years to pay you back.

1410
01:13:00.627 --> 01:13:04.045
It's not a loan. Rena.

1411
01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:08.549
Everything I've gotten.
I've had to take.

1412
01:13:08.635 --> 01:13:11.719
No one gave me anything.

1413
01:13:11.805 --> 01:13:15.840
No one believed in me
the way I believe in you.

1414
01:13:15.934 --> 01:13:18.101
So...

1415
01:13:18.186 --> 01:13:19.894
Take the money.

1416
01:13:19.979 --> 01:13:22.179
Start your business.

1417
01:13:22.273 --> 01:13:24.482
Have your dream.

1418
01:13:33.743 --> 01:13:36.911
Let's go find out who
killed our friend.

1419
01:13:49.342 --> 01:13:52.802
[phone rings]

1420
01:13:53.346 --> 01:13:55.263
Hey. Rena.

1421
01:13:55.348 --> 01:13:57.306
Yeah. the tracking
device is installed.

1422
01:13:57.392 --> 01:13:58.766
I gotta go.

1423
01:14:20.081 --> 01:14:21.831
[Hollis]
Gene. Gene. listen to me.

1424
01:14:21.916 --> 01:14:23.249
I'm right about Avery.

1425
01:14:23.376 --> 01:14:25.460
And I'm pretty
sure he's Achilles!

1426
01:14:25.545 --> 01:14:27.962
I just need one thing
to connect him with Bill.

1427
01:14:28.047 --> 01:14:29.413
[Gene]
One thing. like what?

1428
01:14:29.507 --> 01:14:32.258
Well. Bill said that Rory's
friend owned a warehouse.

1429
01:14:32.385 --> 01:14:35.470
[Gene] Okay. and that's
important because...

1430
01:14:35.555 --> 01:14:38.347
I think it's the same warehouse
that Bill talked about.

1431
01:14:38.433 --> 01:14:40.016
The same warehouse
where he was killed.

1432
01:14:40.101 --> 01:14:41.476
[Gene] Hmmm...

1433
01:14:41.561 --> 01:14:42.935
I should have Miller
meet you there.

1434
01:14:43.062 --> 01:14:44.604
No no no no.
Listen listen listen.

1435
01:14:44.731 --> 01:14:46.856
I'm literally
going to sneak in.

1436
01:14:46.941 --> 01:14:49.901
take a photo of a
wall and leave. Okay?

1437
01:14:49.986 --> 01:14:51.986
This is the final piece I
want before I confront Avery.

1438
01:14:52.071 --> 01:14:53.404
All right.
I'll call you when I'm done.

1439
01:14:53.490 --> 01:14:54.697
-[Gene] Be careful.
-All right. bye.

1440
01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:07.186
Well hello. sunshine.

1441
01:16:08.064 --> 01:16:10.940
What? You're not
happy to see me?

1442
01:16:11.067 --> 01:16:12.900
That's a first.
[chuckles]

1443
01:16:15.405 --> 01:16:16.862
Oh tell me.

1444
01:16:16.948 --> 01:16:22.034
How did you like my little crime
scene recreation in my office?

1445
01:16:22.829 --> 01:16:24.787
You planted that?

1446
01:16:24.914 --> 01:16:27.615
Well. I knew you would come
after me. you know eventually.

1447
01:16:27.709 --> 01:16:29.834
I just had to make sure
it was on my terms.

1448
01:16:29.919 --> 01:16:32.795
So I just gave
you a little help.

1449
01:16:32.922 --> 01:16:35.047
You set me up.

1450
01:16:37.635 --> 01:16:39.844
Oh you know. Rory.

1451
01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:44.098
he went on and on about your
stupid little book club.

1452
01:16:45.602 --> 01:16:50.187
Ah. your loser ex-husband.
he was really weak.

1453
01:16:50.273 --> 01:16:53.024
I'm sure you knew that already.

1454
01:16:53.109 --> 01:16:54.567
But at least he tried
to look out for you

1455
01:16:54.652 --> 01:16:57.144
in his own pathetic way.
[puffs on the cigar]

1456
01:16:57.238 --> 01:16:58.812
What are you talking about?

1457
01:16:58.906 --> 01:17:00.031
Oh...
[puffing on cigar]

1458
01:17:03.369 --> 01:17:05.911
He whined so much about
how he set you up

1459
01:17:05.997 --> 01:17:09.156
that Rory felt bad and
begged me to hire you.

1460
01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:11.325
Give you a legitimate shot.

1461
01:17:11.419 --> 01:17:12.826
Worked out for me

1462
01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:16.297
because they were both
indebted to me more than ever.

1463
01:17:16.382 --> 01:17:19.500
You're Achilles.

1464
01:17:19.594 --> 01:17:22.511
Not the name I would
have given myself but...

1465
01:17:24.015 --> 01:17:26.840
Yes.

1466
01:17:26.934 --> 01:17:31.520
That promissory thing was
brilliant. don't you think?

1467
01:17:31.648 --> 01:17:33.189
I could walk you
through all the details

1468
01:17:33.316 --> 01:17:37.068
because I know how much you
love a good murder mystery.

1469
01:17:37.153 --> 01:17:39.987
You really do. don't you?

1470
01:17:40.073 --> 01:17:43.366
Let me narrate.

1471
01:17:43.493 --> 01:17:47.161
Rory threatened to expose
your entire operation.

1472
01:17:47.246 --> 01:17:49.705
You slipped in through
the courtyard doors

1473
01:17:49.832 --> 01:17:53.084
and exchanged the brandy and
the cigars for poisonous ones.

1474
01:17:53.169 --> 01:17:55.544
just like in the book.

1475
01:17:55.672 --> 01:17:58.381
I guess my question is. did you
plan on his ex-con friends

1476
01:17:58.508 --> 01:18:01.384
being there that evening or
was that just. I don't know.

1477
01:18:01.511 --> 01:18:03.010
convenience?

1478
01:18:03.096 --> 01:18:05.388
You are clever. Hollis!

1479
01:18:05.515 --> 01:18:07.723
I always liked that about you.

1480
01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:10.384
No. you got scared.

1481
01:18:10.478 --> 01:18:12.395
You thought I might be
able to convince Bill

1482
01:18:12.522 --> 01:18:14.271
to go to the police.

1483
01:18:14.357 --> 01:18:16.816
So you killed him too.

1484
01:18:17.819 --> 01:18:19.568
The End.

1485
01:18:19.696 --> 01:18:21.654
[Hollis]
Not quite.

1486
01:18:21.739 --> 01:18:24.448
All this magnanimous
pro bono work

1487
01:18:24.534 --> 01:18:27.910
for rich old ladies like Marla
was just another way for you

1488
01:18:28.037 --> 01:18:31.455
to take advantage of people
and steal their money.

1489
01:18:31.541 --> 01:18:35.251
The bottom line: you're a lying.
cheating. murderous.

1490
01:18:35.378 --> 01:18:38.087
money grubbing son of a bitch!

1491
01:18:38.214 --> 01:18:41.590
[clapping]

1492
01:18:41.718 --> 01:18:43.926
Guilty as charged. counselor.

1493
01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:47.763
Oops! No no.

1494
01:18:47.890 --> 01:18:51.517
You're not a lawyer.

1495
01:18:51.602 --> 01:18:53.686
That is too bad.
[liquid spilling onto floor]

1496
01:18:53.771 --> 01:18:57.440
Because I think we would
have made a nice team.

1497
01:18:57.567 --> 01:19:01.235
Morgan and Mitchell.
Attorneys at Law.

1498
01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:03.237
Kind of has a nice
ring. don't you think?

1499
01:19:03.322 --> 01:19:04.605
You're insane.

1500
01:19:04.699 --> 01:19:06.949
Ah. well.
[laughs]

1501
01:19:07.076 --> 01:19:09.452
Ahh... There we go.

1502
01:19:09.579 --> 01:19:11.495
[can bangs on floor]

1503
01:19:24.969 --> 01:19:27.887
You know. we really
could've had something...

1504
01:19:27.972 --> 01:19:30.389
Hot.

1505
01:19:40.943 --> 01:19:43.611
[puffing deeply]

1506
01:19:46.282 --> 01:19:48.199
Good night. Hollis.

1507
01:19:48.284 --> 01:19:49.408
No!

1508
01:19:57.710 --> 01:19:59.168
[sobbing]
No.

1509
01:20:00.463 --> 01:20:05.216
Help me! Someone please help me.
Please!

1510
01:20:05.301 --> 01:20:08.177
Avery come back! Please!

1511
01:20:09.806 --> 01:20:11.889
Please! Please help me!

1512
01:20:15.269 --> 01:20:17.511
Please! Avery!
Please come back...

1513
01:20:17.605 --> 01:20:19.271
[Miller]
Hollis! Hollis!

1514
01:20:28.324 --> 01:20:31.358
[Miller] I got you! I got you!
It's okay. I got you.

1515
01:20:31.452 --> 01:20:33.360
[sirens]

1516
01:20:33.454 --> 01:20:35.195
Come on. Come on!
Let's go.

1517
01:20:35.289 --> 01:20:39.458
[sirens]

1518
01:20:45.466 --> 01:20:47.675
[Miller and Hollis panting]

1519
01:20:52.223 --> 01:20:54.557
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

1520
01:20:54.684 --> 01:20:56.058
You? Let's go over here.
Come on.

1521
01:20:56.519 --> 01:20:57.852
[Lincoln]
Keep them here.

1522
01:20:59.522 --> 01:21:00.980
[Paramedic]
Set her down over here.

1523
01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:05.067
[Miller]
Not now. Detective.

1524
01:21:05.194 --> 01:21:06.527
I just need to ask
a few questions...

1525
01:21:06.612 --> 01:21:09.780
[Miller] Not now.
Just not now.

1526
01:21:17.582 --> 01:21:20.240
Great job catching
Avery so fast.

1527
01:21:20.334 --> 01:21:21.959
Yeah. well. we can't
take the credit.

1528
01:21:22.044 --> 01:21:24.420
Seems that someone installed
a tracker on his car.

1529
01:21:24.547 --> 01:21:27.748
Remotely disabled the engine
before he could drive away.

1530
01:21:27.842 --> 01:21:30.801
You guys wouldn't know anything
about that. would you?

1531
01:21:34.557 --> 01:21:36.432
[Lincoln] You don't have to
worry about Avery Mitchell.

1532
01:21:36.559 --> 01:21:39.059
He's going away for
a very long time.

1533
01:21:39.145 --> 01:21:41.520
Thank you. Detective.
Thank you.

1534
01:21:50.907 --> 01:21:52.573
[Miller]
Are you sure you're okay?

1535
01:21:52.658 --> 01:21:56.160
Yeah. I'm sure. I can do it.
I can drive. Thank you.

1536
01:22:30.112 --> 01:22:32.112
[Judge Martin] According to your
support letters. Ms. Morgan.

1537
01:22:32.198 --> 01:22:34.114
you're a saint.

1538
01:22:36.118 --> 01:22:39.370
[Judge Martin] We all
know that's not the case.

1539
01:22:39.455 --> 01:22:41.989
You committed a serious offense

1540
01:22:42.083 --> 01:22:44.917
that violated the trust
of a lot of people.

1541
01:22:45.002 --> 01:22:48.462
And now you want us to pretend
that that didn't happen.

1542
01:22:48.547 --> 01:22:50.714
What's changed?

1543
01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:52.800
Thank you. Your Honor.

1544
01:22:58.683 --> 01:23:01.392
I've changed.

1545
01:23:01.477 --> 01:23:04.177
I don't take things
for granted anymore.

1546
01:23:04.271 --> 01:23:07.690
Not my freedom.
not opportunities.

1547
01:23:07.817 --> 01:23:10.526
not my relationships.

1548
01:23:21.539 --> 01:23:24.164
I have dreams. Your Honor.

1549
01:23:24.250 --> 01:23:27.034
I really need this certificate
to prove to society

1550
01:23:27.128 --> 01:23:30.203
that I've learned my lesson.

1551
01:23:30.297 --> 01:23:33.215
There's not a day
that goes by that

1552
01:23:33.342 --> 01:23:36.710
I don't think about those
people that I've hurt.

1553
01:23:36.804 --> 01:23:39.013
And I'm motivated.

1554
01:23:39.098 --> 01:23:42.433
I'm so motivated
to helping others.

1555
01:23:42.518 --> 01:23:45.269
I'm committed to doing that.
Your Honor.

1556
01:23:45.354 --> 01:23:48.439
for the rest of my life.

1557
01:23:51.444 --> 01:23:54.728
[Judge Martin] I've received a
lot of letters on your behalf.

1558
01:23:54.822 --> 01:23:56.897
but the one that
stands out the most

1559
01:23:56.991 --> 01:24:00.242
is the one that I received from
the Old City Police Department.

1560
01:24:00.369 --> 01:24:02.036
Apparently you were
recently a suspect

1561
01:24:02.121 --> 01:24:04.905
in a murder investigation.

1562
01:24:04.999 --> 01:24:07.916
Along with that communication
come a memo from

1563
01:24:08.044 --> 01:24:11.295
Detective Jonathan Faber who
has some very strong opinions

1564
01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:15.382
about your request for a
