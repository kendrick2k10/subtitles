00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.103
You know you ain't
supposed to be up there.

25
00:01:42.137 --> 00:01:42.827
- I know.

26
00:01:44.275 --> 00:01:45.862
- Oh my God.

27
00:01:45.896 --> 00:01:48.172
- I promised the church
a few dozen cookies

28
00:01:48.206 --> 00:01:49.482
for the community event.

29
00:01:49.517 --> 00:01:50.413
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

30
00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:53.137
- Really. Roz?

31
00:01:53.172 --> 00:01:54.620
- Uh...

32
00:01:54.655 --> 00:01:56.517
- Does that look
like cookies. huh?

33
00:01:56.551 --> 00:01:58.137
Well I may have
had a slight craving.

34
00:01:58.172 --> 00:01:59.241
- Oh my God. what is that?

35
00:02:01.413 --> 00:02:02.620
Ugh!

36
00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:03.724
- It's a surprise.

37
00:02:03.758 --> 00:02:04.620
- Is that peanut butter?

38
00:02:04.655 --> 00:02:06.379
- Mm-hmm.

39
00:02:06.413 --> 00:02:08.310
- You know that's not
good for the baby.

40
00:02:08.344 --> 00:02:09.206
- I know.

41
00:02:11.482 --> 00:02:12.862
- You are tripping.

42
00:02:14.482 --> 00:02:15.551
Upstairs. let's go.

43
00:02:17.275 --> 00:02:19.689
- I just need you to
get off of that laptop.

44
00:02:19.724 --> 00:02:22.310
Do you plan on working
through the entire weekend?

45
00:02:22.344 --> 00:02:24.379
No.

46
00:02:24.413 --> 00:02:27.206
Actually. I'm
officially wrapped.

47
00:02:27.241 --> 00:02:30.655
Your boo-thing is here

49
00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:34.689
- You promise?
- Mm-hmm.

50
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.172
Okay.

51
00:02:45.344 --> 00:02:47.344
- Okay. baby.

52
00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.793
Well. good. because
I could use some help.

53
00:02:49.827 --> 00:02:51.241
- Well. good.
- Guess I can.

54
00:02:51.275 --> 00:02:52.241
- You got it?
- Mm-hm.

55
00:02:52.275 --> 00:02:53.517
- I'm here. baby.

56
00:02:53.551 --> 00:02:54.793
- Which one?

57
00:02:54.827 --> 00:02:56.241
- The cheetah one.

58
00:02:56.275 --> 00:02:57.724
Okay.

59
00:02:57.758 --> 00:03:00.344
- You're looking like a
little sexy. pregnant.

60
00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:01.310
jungle cat.

61
00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:08.758
- Yeah. growl your
butt up into bed.

62
00:03:10.517 --> 00:03:13.482
Just tell me what you
need. baby. I'm here.

63
00:03:13.517 --> 00:03:16.551
- Ooh. what I don't
need is the question.

64
00:03:16.586 --> 00:03:17.862
Let's see. I have to
go grocery shopping

65
00:03:17.896 --> 00:03:19.724
for Christmas dinner.

66
00:03:19.758 --> 00:03:20.448
I have to prep the
house for family.

67
00:03:20.482 --> 00:03:22.655
I have to prep the baby's room.

68
00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:25.620
The doula sent over a last
minute list for the home birth.

69
00:03:25.655 --> 00:03:27.551
and that comes with a side of

70
00:03:27.586 --> 00:03:29.620
pushing out a whole human being!

71
00:03:29.655 --> 00:03:32.586
Pssh. well. that's a-

72
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.724
- Ooh!

73
00:03:34.758 --> 00:03:35.379
- Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.
whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

74
00:03:35.413 --> 00:03:36.517
What was that?

75
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:37.517
You good?
- Oh.

76
00:03:37.551 --> 00:03:37.724
Just a little gas.

77
00:03:38.758 --> 00:03:39.862
- Baby. did you just poot on me?

78
00:03:39.896 --> 00:03:41.586
- Nah. I pooted on my side.

79
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.793
Nasty

80
00:03:42.827 --> 00:03:43.931
- Nasty on my side.

81
00:03:47.344 --> 00:03:48.827
- But I still think that you're

82
00:03:50.586 --> 00:03:52.275
stressing yourself
out a little too much.

83
00:03:53.793 --> 00:03:55.275
- Dalton.

84
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.724
- No. don't you Dalton me.

85
00:03:56.758 --> 00:03:58.758
'cause you already know
what the doctor said.

86
00:03:58.793 --> 00:04:00.689
You gotta watch your
cortisol levels.

87
00:04:00.724 --> 00:04:03.827
and this is the last stretch so.

88
00:04:03.862 --> 00:04:06.034
you're supposed to
be relaxing. right?

89
00:04:06.068 --> 00:04:08.034
- Yeah. but how am I
supposed to do that?

90
00:04:08.068 --> 00:04:10.344
There's so much to do.
and who's gonna do it?

91
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.482
Who?

92
00:04:12.517 --> 00:04:13.482
You and Esta?

93
00:04:13.517 --> 00:04:14.965
Yeah. duh!

94
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.517
- The last time I had
you two make cookies.

95
00:04:16.551 --> 00:04:18.517
they were so hard
Pete chipped his tooth

96
00:04:18.551 --> 00:04:20.034
and he never forgot about that.

97
00:04:20.068 --> 00:04:21.655
- Pssh. don't nobody
care about no Pete.

98
00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:23.034
And whoa. whoa.
whoa. whoa. whoa.

99
00:04:23.068 --> 00:04:24.965
My cookies are way
better than that nasty

100
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.517
grilled. charbroiled cheese
mess that you had down there!

101
00:04:28.551 --> 00:04:29.896
- I'm gonna make another one.

102
00:04:29.931 --> 00:04:30.689
- You almost burned
the house down!

103
00:04:30.724 --> 00:04:31.758
- You're so dramatic.

104
00:04:31.793 --> 00:04:33.620
- And now you see.

105
00:04:33.655 --> 00:04:34.655
Now you see. I told
you it was the oven.

106
00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:36.689
It wasn't me.

107
00:04:36.724 --> 00:04:37.482
I didn't mess up the cookies.
- Oh. it was the oven?

108
00:04:37.517 --> 00:04:38.931
- It was the oven.

109
00:04:38.965 --> 00:04:40.448
- No. no. no. no.
it was the game.

110
00:04:40.482 --> 00:04:41.827
Was the game in the oven?

111
00:04:41.862 --> 00:04:43.448
You were paying
attention to the game

112
00:04:43.482 --> 00:04:44.827
more than you were
paying attention

113
00:04:44.862 --> 00:04:46.482
to the oven.
- Okay. the game.

114
00:04:46.517 --> 00:04:47.620
Yeah. so?
- Now. if we put the game

115
00:04:47.655 --> 00:04:49.517
in the oven. maybe the cookies

116
00:04:49.551 --> 00:04:50.689
would've turned out softer.
- Put the game in the oven?

117
00:04:50.724 --> 00:04:51.586
So yeah I watched the game. so?

118
00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.344
- Okay.
- Forget that.

119
00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.931
Are you trying to say
that I can't cook?

120
00:04:53.965 --> 00:04:55.689
- No. you can't!

121
00:04:55.724 --> 00:04:56.517
- Are you saying
that I can't cook?

122
00:04:56.551 --> 00:04:58.448
- You cannot.

123
00:04:58.482 --> 00:04:59.448
And now I'm known as the woman
who makes concrete cookies.

124
00:04:59.482 --> 00:05:02.586
Aw. baby!

125
00:05:03.758 --> 00:05:04.620
I love your cookies.

126
00:05:04.655 --> 00:05:05.724
- I know you do.

127
00:05:05.758 --> 00:05:06.724
That's how we got here.

128
00:05:06.758 --> 00:05:10.586
But I still think

129
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.931
you're stressing
yourself too much.

130
00:05:12.965 --> 00:05:15.724
You know. you be doing too much.

131
00:05:15.758 --> 00:05:17.620
Overexerting.

132
00:05:17.655 --> 00:05:19.862
- I have people depending on me.

133
00:05:19.896 --> 00:05:22.413
- I'm not worried about people.

134
00:05:22.448 --> 00:05:24.586
You're the only person
I'm worried about.

135
00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.586
and my son getting here
safely and healthy.

136
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.620
'Cause if my boy come out
with 20 toes. I'm telling you.

137
00:05:30.655 --> 00:05:31.931
I am gonna rough you up. girl.

138
00:05:34.137 --> 00:05:37.758
- Your baby's not gonna come
out with 20 toes. Dalton.

139
00:05:37.793 --> 00:05:38.896
So what do you suggest?

140
00:05:40.655 --> 00:05:42.896
- This weekend. anything
that doesn't involve you

141
00:05:42.931 --> 00:05:46.068
or this baby. we
need to scrap it.

142
00:05:47.896 --> 00:05:51.344
- Wait. are you saying
we cancel Christmas?

143
00:05:52.413 --> 00:05:53.931
- Bingo.

144
00:05:53.965 --> 00:05:54.931
- No.
- You said it.

145
00:05:54.965 --> 00:05:56.448
- Dalton. no. no. no.

146
00:05:56.482 --> 00:05:58.103
- No. you said it. not me.

147
00:05:58.137 --> 00:06:00.103
- No. my mom and sister are
looking forward to coming here.

148
00:06:00.137 --> 00:06:02.413
and as annoying as your
brothers are. they are too.

149
00:06:02.448 --> 00:06:03.103
Dalton!

150
00:06:04.896 --> 00:06:06.793
- Girl. do I look
like Santa Claus?

151
00:06:06.827 --> 00:06:08.620
And do you look like Mrs. Claus?

152
00:06:08.655 --> 00:06:10.034
No.

153
00:06:10.068 --> 00:06:11.931
So their Christmas does
not revolve around us.

154
00:06:11.965 --> 00:06:13.655
- Dalton. stop.
- Uh-uh.

155
00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:14.931
- Give me the phone!
- Watch this.

156
00:06:14.965 --> 00:06:15.827
- Stop!

157
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.827
- And...

158
00:06:18.862 --> 00:06:21.172
Boom. just like that.

159
00:06:21.206 --> 00:06:24.000
Christmas at the McKenzie
house is canceled. baby.

160
00:06:24.034 --> 00:06:25.689
Ho. ho. ho.

161
00:06:25.724 --> 00:06:26.758
- You really did that?

162
00:06:26.793 --> 00:06:28.000
- Yeah. now you can relax.

163
00:06:29.482 --> 00:06:30.137
- Wow!

164
00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:32.620
- See?
- I'm going to sleep.

165
00:06:32.655 --> 00:06:34.482
Whoa.

166
00:06:34.517 --> 00:06:35.655
- And you are banned
for my dreams tonight!

167
00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:36.655
Give me the covers.

168
00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:38.620
- Wow. really?

169
00:06:38.655 --> 00:06:40.482
That's what we doing?
- Mh-hmm. yes.

170
00:06:40.517 --> 00:06:41.620
Cold-blooded people don't
need blankets anyway.

171
00:06:41.655 --> 00:06:43.482
- Cold-blooded?

172
00:06:43.517 --> 00:06:44.482
Wait wait. I thought you
was gonna give me some-

173
00:06:44.517 --> 00:06:45.758
- Ah. no.

174
00:06:45.793 --> 00:06:46.758
- No jungle love?

175
00:06:46.793 --> 00:06:47.620
- Don't touch me.

176
00:06:47.655 --> 00:06:49.827
No jungle love.

177
00:06:49.862 --> 00:06:51.517
Anyway.
- Okay. that's what we doing?

178
00:06:51.551 --> 00:06:52.655
- Yup.

179
00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:53.655
- That's how you gonna...

180
00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:54.000
All right. what what...

181
00:06:55.068 --> 00:06:56.034
All right. well goodnight.

182
00:06:56.068 --> 00:06:57.620
Goodnight.

183
00:06:57.655 --> 00:06:59.000
Wow.

184
00:07:07.896 --> 00:07:09.896
- Okay. fine. it's settled.

185
00:07:09.931 --> 00:07:12.000
We both like mint
chocolate chip ice cream.

186
00:07:12.034 --> 00:07:14.862
and you have to promise me
you'll buy me some one time.

187
00:07:14.896 --> 00:07:16.034
Esta?

188
00:07:17.586 --> 00:07:18.862
Who were you talking to?

189
00:07:18.896 --> 00:07:19.862
What do you mean?

190
00:07:19.896 --> 00:07:21.034
- What do you mean?

191
00:07:21.068 --> 00:07:23.689
I'm talking about
on the phone. Esta.

192
00:07:23.724 --> 00:07:24.724
- Nobody.

193
00:07:24.758 --> 00:07:27.000
- Oh. yeah. nobody.

194
00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.206
I got my eye on you.

195
00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:32.793
- So have you thought
about what we talked about?

196
00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:33.965
- Yeah. I have.

197
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.827
- Well?

198
00:07:35.862 --> 00:07:37.586
- Well. I'm still
thinking about it.

199
00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.586
But truthfully it's
probably gonna be a hard no.

200
00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:42.034
- Dad!

201
00:07:42.068 --> 00:07:43.034
- Esta!

202
00:07:43.068 --> 00:07:44.931
What do you mean?

203
00:07:44.965 --> 00:07:46.724
First it was basketball.
then it was gymnastics.

204
00:07:46.758 --> 00:07:48.862
Now you're telling me
you wanna play golf?

205
00:07:48.896 --> 00:07:50.689
What's gonna be next?

206
00:07:50.724 --> 00:07:52.551
- I mean. isn't the
whole point of childhood

207
00:07:52.586 --> 00:07:54.655
trying to figure out new things
and see what you're good at?

208
00:07:54.689 --> 00:07:56.068
That's all I'm trying to do.

209
00:07:56.103 --> 00:07:58.034
- Yeah. I mean. I
love that about you.

210
00:07:58.068 --> 00:08:00.793
But it seems that you're more
addicted to the opportunities

211
00:08:00.827 --> 00:08:02.896
and allergic to the work.

212
00:08:02.931 --> 00:08:04.827
I mean that. baby.

213
00:08:04.862 --> 00:08:06.827
You keep taking up
all these new hobbies.

214
00:08:06.862 --> 00:08:08.896
and as soon as it gets
a little rough for you.

215
00:08:08.931 --> 00:08:11.000
you drop it and go
to the next thing.

216
00:08:11.034 --> 00:08:13.103
How will you ever know what
you're actually good at

217
00:08:13.137 --> 00:08:15.965
if you don't stick at it
for longer than two months?

218
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.068
Come on.

219
00:08:17.103 --> 00:08:19.965
- Look. I know it's expensive.

220
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.620
But I did the research.

221
00:08:21.655 --> 00:08:23.586
and I really think
I'll be good at it.

222
00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.724
- Baby. of course you're
going to be good at it.

223
00:08:25.758 --> 00:08:27.034
You're a McKenzie.

224
00:08:27.068 --> 00:08:28.896
- Good!

225
00:08:28.931 --> 00:08:30.000
So then you'll pay
for the lessons?

226
00:08:30.034 --> 00:08:30.793
No. I won't.

227
00:08:32.793 --> 00:08:34.793
Come on. Esta. you're
all over the place.

228
00:08:34.827 --> 00:08:36.068
What's up with you?

229
00:08:36.103 --> 00:08:37.103
- Come on. dad.

230
00:08:37.137 --> 00:08:38.793
- Oh my God. all right.

231
00:08:40.068 --> 00:08:42.034
Let's make a deal. all right?

232
00:08:42.068 --> 00:08:43.103
How about you take a break

233
00:08:43.137 --> 00:08:46.931
so you can regroup and recenter?

234
00:08:46.965 --> 00:08:48.793
As soon as you're ready.

235
00:08:48.827 --> 00:08:50.275
I want you to write me a essay

236
00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:53.000
about how bad you want
to take up golf. yeah.

237
00:08:53.034 --> 00:08:55.965
and all this new research
that you done came up with.

238
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.793
And after I read it. then
I'll make my decision.

239
00:08:58.827 --> 00:09:01.241
- Geez. a whole essay?

240
00:09:01.275 --> 00:09:03.034
- Yeah.

241
00:09:03.068 --> 00:09:04.896
And as a matter of fact.

242
00:09:04.931 --> 00:09:05.655
I wanna hear about who your
favorite golfer is too.

243
00:09:07.275 --> 00:09:09.068
- You're wild. Dad.

244
00:09:09.103 --> 00:09:10.000
But okay. deal.

245
00:09:11.758 --> 00:09:13.137
Okay. good. that's
my girl.

246
00:09:17.068 --> 00:09:19.793
- So. since we're at the
bargaining table here.

247
00:09:19.827 --> 00:09:21.103
you think you
might lower the age

248
00:09:21.137 --> 00:09:22.793
I'm allowed to start dating?

249
00:09:22.827 --> 00:09:23.689
Dating?

250
00:09:23.724 --> 00:09:25.689
Man. wait. what?

251
00:09:25.724 --> 00:09:26.724
No!

252
00:09:26.758 --> 00:09:27.310
No. no. no. no!

253
00:09:28.896 --> 00:09:29.827
Boys. I told you.

254
00:09:29.862 --> 00:09:31.862
Books before boys!

255
00:09:31.896 --> 00:09:33.000
Okay. always.

256
00:09:33.034 --> 00:09:34.000
- Dad!

257
00:09:34.034 --> 00:09:36.103
- Dad my butt. girl!

258
00:09:36.137 --> 00:09:38.034
If you don't go downstairs
and get some breakfast.

259
00:09:38.068 --> 00:09:39.724
Matter of fact. breakfast
before boys in this house.

260
00:09:39.758 --> 00:09:40.724
Come on. let's go.

261
00:09:40.758 --> 00:09:41.862
- Not funny.

262
00:09:41.896 --> 00:09:43.689
- No. it's funny all right.

263
00:09:43.724 --> 00:09:45.000
Talking about some boys.

264
00:09:46.034 --> 00:09:46.896
Pssh!

265
00:09:48.655 --> 00:09:50.000
Lord.

266
00:09:53.068 --> 00:09:54.655
My baby's growing up too fast.

267
00:09:59.724 --> 00:10:01.000
Really?

268
00:10:01.034 --> 00:10:02.965
You eating tarts for breakfast?

269
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.965
- You know the deal.

270
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.137
- Good morning.

271
00:10:06.172 --> 00:10:08.000
- Good morning.

272
00:10:08.034 --> 00:10:09.000
- Did you oversleep?

273
00:10:09.896 --> 00:10:11.689
- Not really.

274
00:10:11.724 --> 00:10:13.034
Just had to thaw
out a little bit.

275
00:10:14.034 --> 00:10:15.689
- It's a cold world.

276
00:10:15.724 --> 00:10:16.793
- Hm. who are you telling?

277
00:10:19.241 --> 00:10:21.172
What are you doing.
what you got going on?

278
00:10:21.206 --> 00:10:23.965
- Oh. just organizing
some of my thoughts.

279
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.793
which reminds me.

280
00:10:25.827 --> 00:10:28.344
can you put the baby's
crib together today?

281
00:10:28.379 --> 00:10:31.103
And run some of the errands
we talked about last night?

282
00:10:31.137 --> 00:10:34.172
- Turning me into your
little slave. ain't you?

283
00:10:35.896 --> 00:10:39.896
What. I'm just playing.

284
00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:43.793
You know I will do
whatever you want me to.

285
00:10:43.827 --> 00:10:44.689
- I appreciate you.

286
00:10:45.827 --> 00:10:47.000
- I appreciate you.

287
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.862
Mm little baby mama.

288
00:10:54.724 --> 00:10:57.965
- And on that note. I'm
taking my breakfast upstairs.

289
00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.827
- Oh. you don't like that?

290
00:10:59.862 --> 00:11:03.034
I thought that's what
you said you wanted. huh?

291
00:11:03.068 --> 00:11:03.931
- Wanted?

292
00:11:03.965 --> 00:11:05.758
What did I miss?

293
00:11:05.793 --> 00:11:07.724
- Trust me boo. you
do not wanna know.

294
00:11:10.103 --> 00:11:12.379
But. I'm gonna take this time

295
00:11:13.275 --> 00:11:16.034
to apologize to you for

296
00:11:16.068 --> 00:11:17.379
all that from last night.

297
00:11:19.793 --> 00:11:22.931
- Oh. did you have
a change of heart?

298
00:11:22.965 --> 00:11:25.758
No . I didn't.

299
00:11:25.793 --> 00:11:30.034
But. this ain't a dictatorship.
it's a relationship.

300
00:11:30.068 --> 00:11:31.068
You're my partner. right?

301
00:11:31.103 --> 00:11:34.896
So your opinion matters.

302
00:11:34.931 --> 00:11:36.931
Plus I responded like a jerk.

303
00:11:36.965 --> 00:11:38.310
And I'm not a jerk.

304
00:11:38.344 --> 00:11:41.896
so this is me
apologizing. right?

305
00:11:41.931 --> 00:11:44.724
- Yeah. about that.

306
00:11:46.068 --> 00:11:47.896
I need to tell you something.

307
00:11:47.931 --> 00:11:48.965
- What?

308
00:11:51.034 --> 00:11:53.137
Who the hell is that?

309
00:11:53.172 --> 00:11:54.379
You expecting somebody?

310
00:11:59.103 --> 00:12:00.068
Uh-uh.

311
00:12:03.137 --> 00:12:05.000
Knocking on my door
like the police.

312
00:12:05.034 --> 00:12:06.000
Who is it?

313
00:12:06.034 --> 00:12:07.827
- Merry Christmas!

314
00:12:07.862 --> 00:12:08.379
Here you are honey.

315
00:12:08.413 --> 00:12:10.103
And how are you?

316
00:12:10.137 --> 00:12:11.827
Look at you.
- Oh my goodness.

317
00:12:11.862 --> 00:12:12.965
So cold outside.
- Sweetheart!

318
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:13.965
Oh my God. look at this tree.

319
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Oh my God look at this.

320
00:12:15.034 --> 00:12:16.137
Great!
- Oh we made it.

321
00:12:16.172 --> 00:12:17.827
we made it Mama.
- Yes we did.

322
00:12:17.862 --> 00:12:19.241
Look. she looks like
she's about to pop.

323
00:12:19.275 --> 00:12:20.931
- What the hell are
y'all doing here?

324
00:12:20.965 --> 00:12:22.310
- Dalton. let the
kid stop playing.

325
00:12:22.344 --> 00:12:23.103
- Yeah. I told them
about the mistake.

326
00:12:23.137 --> 00:12:25.000
that it was a mistake.

327
00:12:25.034 --> 00:12:26.965
- Oh. a mistake.
- Oh. what?

328
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.241
Anyway. this place looks

329
00:12:28.275 --> 00:12:29.034
amazing.
- It looks great.

330
00:12:29.068 --> 00:12:30.034
it looks amazing.

331
00:12:30.068 --> 00:12:31.206
Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.

332
00:12:31.241 --> 00:12:32.206
- Thank you. Dalton.

333
00:12:32.241 --> 00:12:34.000
- Oh gosh. you're so

334
00:12:34.034 --> 00:12:35.344
sweet. honey.
- Oh my goodness!

335
00:12:35.379 --> 00:12:37.137
- Oh gosh. yeah. yeah.
- Come on baby.

336
00:12:37.172 --> 00:12:38.827
come on. get your sister.

337
00:12:38.862 --> 00:12:39.137
- Oh. my goodness.

338
00:12:39.172 --> 00:12:39.310
- Man!

339
00:12:44.068 --> 00:12:44.965
Who is it?

340
00:12:46.551 --> 00:12:47.827
- Hey!

341
00:12:47.862 --> 00:12:48.827
- Hey.

342
00:12:48.862 --> 00:12:50.000
- What's up. Big D.

343
00:12:50.034 --> 00:12:51.103
Yeah. my man.

344
00:12:51.137 --> 00:12:52.103
- What's going on. big bro?

345
00:12:52.137 --> 00:12:53.965
How you doing in here?

346
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.206
- What the hell is
y'all doing here. man?

347
00:12:55.241 --> 00:12:56.310
- Damn. we got your text.

348
00:12:56.344 --> 00:12:57.310
- Yeah. you got the text. right?

349
00:12:57.344 --> 00:12:58.206
- You got the text?

350
00:12:58.241 --> 00:12:59.310
- Yeah.

351
00:12:59.344 --> 00:13:01.206
- You can't make up your mind.

352
00:13:01.241 --> 00:13:02.275
is it Christmas or
it's not Christmas?

353
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:03.931
- All right. yeah man.

354
00:13:03.965 --> 00:13:05.379
Merry Christmas.

355
00:13:07.103 --> 00:13:08.344
- You know what I'm saying-

356
00:13:08.379 --> 00:13:09.896
- Since you ain't
come empty handed.

357
00:13:09.931 --> 00:13:10.448
- Yeah bro.
- Damn.

358
00:13:10.482 --> 00:13:11.206
- Did you cook?

359
00:13:12.931 --> 00:13:14.241
Yeah. I hope you
least got some snacks.

360
00:13:14.275 --> 00:13:15.172
- Yeah. take this-
- Come on bro.

361
00:13:15.206 --> 00:13:16.344
I'm gonna take this in there.

362
00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:17.931
I'm gonna take my coat off man.

363
00:13:17.965 --> 00:13:19.034
- Good to see you baby bro.

364
00:13:19.068 --> 00:13:20.448
Hey.

Hey. what it do?

You know what it is.

367
00:13:25.103 --> 00:13:27.034
- I had some sweet
tea on the drive-

368
00:13:27.068 --> 00:13:28.896
- Yeah.

369
00:13:28.931 --> 00:13:29.448
- You gotta drop him off?

370
00:13:29.482 --> 00:13:30.275
- Yeah.

371
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:31.379
Do I?

372
00:13:31.413 --> 00:13:32.379
Where is it at. is it upstairs?

373
00:13:32.413 --> 00:13:33.275
I'll go upstairs.

374
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:33.551
- To the right.

375
00:13:34.965 --> 00:13:36.172
- Hey!

376
00:13:40.103 --> 00:13:41.206
- Anybody else outs...

377
00:13:49.241 --> 00:13:52.931
I can't believe
this. man.

378
00:13:56.137 --> 00:13:57.172
Really?

379
00:13:57.206 --> 00:13:58.379
Shit bro.

380
00:13:58.413 --> 00:13:59.931
What's going on?

381
00:14:01.137 --> 00:14:02.206
- It's about time you joined us.

382
00:14:02.241 --> 00:14:03.103
- Whatever.

383
00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:05.965
Had to finish being somebody's

384
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.482
little concierge/personal
servant.

385
00:14:08.517 --> 00:14:10.413
- Mh-hmm. I see you still
got your sense of humor.

386
00:14:10.448 --> 00:14:12.241
How you doing. brother-in-law?

387
00:14:12.275 --> 00:14:14.206
- I'm good. Lisa. Lisa.

388
00:14:14.241 --> 00:14:15.620
What's up with you?

389
00:14:15.655 --> 00:14:17.310
Bro has told me you got
that new hair salon.

390
00:14:17.344 --> 00:14:18.344
how's that going for you?

391
00:14:18.379 --> 00:14:20.068
- Well. it's going real good.

392
00:14:20.103 --> 00:14:21.965
- Oh good.

393
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.620
Just don't be one
of those salons

394
00:14:23.655 --> 00:14:25.103
that expect you to come
with your hair half done.

395
00:14:25.137 --> 00:14:27.241
before you sit in the chair.

396
00:14:27.275 --> 00:14:28.517
- Aren't those the worst?

397
00:14:28.551 --> 00:14:30.275
- Yes.
- They expect you

398
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:31.344
to come de-tangled.
washed. dried.

399
00:14:31.379 --> 00:14:33.206
that's why I just went natural.

400
00:14:33.241 --> 00:14:34.275
And they want you to
bring the products?

401
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:36.137
Oh. I don't think so.

402
00:14:36.172 --> 00:14:37.275
Y'all know that's not gonna
be in my salon. all right?

403
00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:39.275
Every style comes with a shampoo

404
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:41.172
and a conditioner.
that's ridiculous.

405
00:14:41.206 --> 00:14:42.172
Good.

406
00:14:42.206 --> 00:14:44.000
- That is fascinating.

407
00:14:44.034 --> 00:14:45.517
You're still seeing
that loser boyfriend?

408
00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:47.344
- Why you stay in my business?

409
00:14:47.379 --> 00:14:49.103
- I only asked a question.

410
00:14:49.137 --> 00:14:51.310
- Okay. don't start you two.

411
00:14:51.344 --> 00:14:53.034
- You already know I ain't
paying him no attention.

412
00:14:53.068 --> 00:14:54.103
- Hey. everybody.

413
00:14:54.137 --> 00:14:57.275

00:15:03.448 --> 00:15:05.275
- She's a grown woman now.

419
00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:06.482
- It's good to see you.

420
00:15:06.517 --> 00:15:08.344
- Get out of here. girl.

421
00:15:08.379 --> 00:15:09.310
You're so big.

422
00:15:12.137 --> 00:15:14.000
- She's beautiful.

423
00:15:14.034 --> 00:15:15.103
I bet the boys are lining
up to see you. honey.

424
00:15:15.137 --> 00:15:16.206
- I hope dad's gonna help me.

425
00:15:16.241 --> 00:15:18.034
- Hey. hey. hey. watch it.

426
00:15:18.068 --> 00:15:19.413
- Uh-uh. I know you're not
gonna be that way with your son.

427
00:15:19.448 --> 00:15:21.275
double standard.

428
00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:22.448
- Double standards?

429
00:15:22.482 --> 00:15:24.482
- I know when my little brother

430
00:15:24.517 --> 00:15:27.172
and he's probably gonna treat
him the same way he does

431
00:15:27.206 --> 00:15:28.137
our dear Esta.

432
00:15:28.172 --> 00:15:29.482
- Exactly.

433
00:15:29.517 --> 00:15:31.344

00:15:38.689 --> 00:15:40.206
- I'm a guest and
I'm eating breakfast.

440
00:15:40.241 --> 00:15:41.172

My mom needs me to do something.

I tried but I mean. what am
I supposed to do. sneak out?

482
00:17:06.517 --> 00:17:08.137
I can't do that. I'll

00:17:16.172 --> 00:17:17.793
Okay. okay fine.

See you in a bit.

488
00:17:35.379 --> 00:17:36.482
♪ Jingle bells

489
00:17:36.517 --> 00:17:37.655
♪ Jingle bells

490
00:17:37.689 --> 00:17:39.482
♪ Jingle all the way

491
00:17:39.517 --> 00:17:40.448
- How do you cut these things?

492
00:17:40.482 --> 00:17:42.172
- Why did I keep telling you?

493
00:17:42.206 --> 00:17:44.448
You cut onions
under running water.

494
00:17:44.482 --> 00:17:46.758
- Mama. you now how
hardheaded Lisa. is.

495
00:17:46.793 --> 00:17:49.310
You can tell her how to do
something a million times.

496
00:17:49.344 --> 00:17:51.172
she's still gonna do
what she wants to do.

497
00:17:51.206 --> 00:17:52.310
- True.

498
00:17:52.344 --> 00:17:53.724
- Um. I can. I can hear y'all.

499
00:17:53.758 --> 00:17:55.241
- We know.

500
00:17:57.172 --> 00:17:59.448
- Speaking of hardheaded.
are you still with Brandon?

501
00:18:02.689 --> 00:18:04.689
- Don't get started with me
guys. don't get started with me.

502
00:18:04.724 --> 00:18:06.724
- I'm just saying. Lisa.

503
00:18:06.758 --> 00:18:09.344
you used to be smiling
and laughing all the time.

504
00:18:09.379 --> 00:18:10.862
hanging out with your friends.

505
00:18:12.275 --> 00:18:13.689
I don't want him to change you.

506
00:18:15.241 --> 00:18:16.724
- You're just so dramatic.

507
00:18:16.758 --> 00:18:18.310
Nobody is changing
anybody. I'm fine.

508
00:18:18.344 --> 00:18:19.310
- You're fine?

509
00:18:19.344 --> 00:18:20.172
- Yes. I'm fine.

510
00:18:20.206 --> 00:18:21.344
- Fine?

511
00:18:21.379 --> 00:18:22.517
- Yes. fine.

512
00:18:22.551 --> 00:18:24.241
- Does he have a new job

513
00:18:24.275 --> 00:18:25.724
or is he still
asking you for money?

514
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:29.241
- You know what?

515
00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:30.379
How about we stop talking
about me and mine.

516
00:18:30.413 --> 00:18:32.379
And we talk about you and yours.

517
00:18:32.413 --> 00:18:33.379
Yeah.

518
00:18:33.413 --> 00:18:37.482
- Oh. what about us?

519
00:18:38.551 --> 00:18:41.206
- Mama. not you too.

520
00:18:41.241 --> 00:18:45.379
- Well. since your sister
brought it up. I'm curious too.

521
00:18:45.413 --> 00:18:47.551
I mean. after all the last
time we saw you two together.

522
00:18:47.586 --> 00:18:51.379
you were divorced and now
you're living in this big house

523
00:18:51.413 --> 00:18:53.344
and you're expecting a baby.

524
00:18:53.379 --> 00:18:56.379
Do you plan on
remarrying. I hope?

525
00:18:56.413 --> 00:18:57.724
- It's complicated.

526
00:18:57.758 --> 00:19:00.275
- Make it uncomplicated. honey.

527
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:01.724
Please simplify it for mother

528
00:19:01.758 --> 00:19:04.379
because I hope
Dalton doesn't expect

529
00:19:04.413 --> 00:19:06.275
to get the milk for free
without buying the cow.

530
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:07.965
Moo-moo.

531
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.275
- Not that it's any
of your business.

532
00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:11.000
- Oh. wait a minute.

533
00:19:11.034 --> 00:19:14.586
- Oh. wait. mama. she said

534
00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.448

535
00:19:16.482 --> 00:19:17.689
get off frustrated
and get into a car.

536
00:19:17.724 --> 00:19:18.586
mama. that's what she said.

537
00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:19.758
- Oh. come on.

538
00:19:19.793 --> 00:19:23.551
Lisa. seriously Lisa?

539
00:19:23.586 --> 00:19:24.586
- All right. all right.

540
00:19:33.413 --> 00:19:34.551
- Lisa. why do you
always have to put

541
00:19:34.586 --> 00:19:36.586
so much sauce everything.

542
00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.413
Okay. respectfully. mama.

543
00:19:40.448 --> 00:19:42.551
- That's better.

544
00:19:42.586 --> 00:19:44.689
- A few months ago. Dalton
did ask me to remarry him.

545
00:19:44.724 --> 00:19:45.551
- What!

546
00:19:45.586 --> 00:19:46.448
Come on now.

547
00:19:48.655 --> 00:19:49.827
- I said. no.

548
00:19:50.793 --> 00:19:52.275
- You said what?

549
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:53.827
- I said. no.

550
00:19:53.862 --> 00:19:55.758
- Honey. have you lost
your natural mind?

551
00:19:55.793 --> 00:19:56.862
- No.

552
00:19:56.896 --> 00:19:57.862
- Okay.

553
00:19:57.896 --> 00:19:58.620
Okay. let's just start.

554
00:20:00.655 --> 00:20:04.896
Honey. Dalton happens to be
my favorite. I'm sorry Lisa.

555
00:20:04.931 --> 00:20:07.620
'cause the Tony with the
double boot. is a no go.

556
00:20:07.655 --> 00:20:08.862
- It was Brandon's Miles.

557
00:20:08.896 --> 00:20:10.724
- Okay. Brandon. Tony. whatever.

558
00:20:10.758 --> 00:20:11.724
he had a double boot on the car.

559
00:20:11.758 --> 00:20:13.758
- Yeah.

560
00:20:13.793 --> 00:20:15.379
- This is not a big
deal. but it was Brandon.

561
00:20:15.413 --> 00:20:18.310
- Honey. listen.
he's my favorite.

562
00:20:18.344 --> 00:20:19.827
I could see how he loves you.

563
00:20:19.862 --> 00:20:21.586
I could see it in
his eyes. honey.

564
00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:23.620
A mother knows.

565
00:20:23.655 --> 00:20:25.551
And it's hard to
find a good man.

566
00:20:25.586 --> 00:20:28.586
And when you find one.
you've gotta hold on tight.

567
00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:29.758
You gotta hold
on. you've gotta hold on.

568
00:20:29.793 --> 00:20:31.827
- Grip it.

569
00:20:31.862 --> 00:20:32.758
- Because otherwise you can
let him loose out there.

570
00:20:32.793 --> 00:20:34.586
anybody gonna snatch him up?

571
00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:35.724
Can't have these
good men out there.

572
00:20:35.758 --> 00:20:37.586
- But that is so old school.

573
00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:41.275
Dalton and I are taking it slow.

574
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:43.620
- I don't see the
slow in any of this.

575
00:20:43.655 --> 00:20:46.448
The big house. the baby coming.

576
00:20:46.482 --> 00:20:49.310
My grandchild-
- Doesn't look slow to me.

577
00:20:49.344 --> 00:20:51.310
you know. with those
glasses really?

578
00:20:51.344 --> 00:20:51.793
- Mama.

579
00:20:51.827 --> 00:20:53.310
- Huh?

580
00:20:53.344 --> 00:20:55.551
- Our lives. our business.

581
00:20:55.586 --> 00:20:57.896
- Oh. oh.
- Oh. shit.

582
00:20:57.931 --> 00:21:00.793
- Well. it seems to
me you wouldn't know
what came before us

583
00:21:00.827 --> 00:21:02.620
if it stared you in the eye.

584
00:21:02.655 --> 00:21:03.655
But I understand you
young girls today.

585
00:21:03.689 --> 00:21:05.517
Lisa. the cookies are on.

586
00:21:05.551 --> 00:21:06.965
- Oh no. Esta's
doing the cookie.

587
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:07.862
Mama. don't take it out
on your own daughter.

588
00:21:07.896 --> 00:21:08.931
- She said out my business.

589
00:21:08.965 --> 00:21:10.724
Imagine. imagine that.

590
00:21:10.758 --> 00:21:12.689
Can I say. get out
my business.

591
00:21:15.379 --> 00:21:15.931
She said-
- Exactly.

592
00:21:15.965 --> 00:21:17.448
It's not funny.

593
00:21:17.482 --> 00:21:17.896
- I'm sorry. she left us.

594
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.413
So. she said taking slow is
being nine months pregnant.

595
00:21:29.896 --> 00:21:31.689
- You know what man.
this is ridiculous. man.

596
00:21:31.724 --> 00:21:33.344
You would think that after
you'd have been around

597
00:21:33.379 --> 00:21:35.379
the block a few times.
putting together a crib.

598
00:21:35.413 --> 00:21:36.517
be a piece of cake.

599
00:21:36.551 --> 00:21:37.655
- I'm telling you. bro. yeah.

600
00:21:37.689 --> 00:21:39.482
I do not remember this

601
00:21:39.517 --> 00:21:41.000
being that hard the
first time around.

602
00:21:41.034 --> 00:21:42.827
Man. I think it's
adrenaline problem.

603
00:21:42.862 --> 00:21:46.344
Why do they just want your
adrenaline to kick in. you know.

604
00:21:46.379 --> 00:21:50.620
nothing seems hard when it's
new and exciting. you see?

605
00:21:50.655 --> 00:21:52.344
- Yeah bro. you got a point.

606
00:21:52.379 --> 00:21:53.862
- Yeah man. I'm trying
to tell you bro.

607
00:21:53.896 --> 00:21:58.344
Jobs. kids.
relationships. everything.

608
00:21:58.379 --> 00:22:00.586
Everything seems
easy when it's new.

609
00:22:01.896 --> 00:22:02.896
- You speaking facts today.

610
00:22:02.931 --> 00:22:04.931
- Yes sir.

611
00:22:04.965 --> 00:22:06.551
- Big bro. let me see that
other screwdriver order. man.

612
00:22:06.586 --> 00:22:07.724
- There you go.

613
00:22:07.758 --> 00:22:08.551
- Swap me up.

614
00:22:08.586 --> 00:22:09.896
- Yeah.

615
00:22:09.931 --> 00:22:11.965
Hey man. just wanna say.

616
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.758
I really like what you y'all
are building right here.

617
00:22:14.793 --> 00:22:17.448
You know. this house
is beautiful and
your family is too.

618
00:22:19.103 --> 00:22:20.551
- We've got an imposter.
where's the real Dalton.

619
00:22:20.586 --> 00:22:22.620
- What?

620
00:22:22.655 --> 00:22:23.896
Don't take unless you're
getting soft on us now. bro?

621
00:22:23.931 --> 00:22:24.724
What's up?

622
00:22:24.758 --> 00:22:26.586
- I mean. maybe.

623
00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:28.862
Dalton. look. I see
what you and Roz have.

624
00:22:28.896 --> 00:22:32.448
And Pete. what you and Claire
had. and God rest her soul.

625
00:22:32.482 --> 00:22:35.551
I don't know. I'm feeling like
I want that for myself now.

626
00:22:35.586 --> 00:22:36.413
- Really?

627
00:22:36.448 --> 00:22:37.551
- Yeah. really.

628
00:22:37.586 --> 00:22:38.413
- That's how you are feeling.

629
00:22:38.448 --> 00:22:40.620
- That's right.

630
00:22:40.655 --> 00:22:41.551
Go check that window.
I guarantee it's a
blizzard outside.

631
00:22:41.586 --> 00:22:42.689
The most selling dad.

632
00:22:43.896 --> 00:22:45.448
- He'll just freeze over.

633
00:22:45.482 --> 00:22:46.896
- Okay. yeah.

634
00:22:46.931 --> 00:22:49.000
Look. I know it
sounds crazy. right?

635
00:22:49.034 --> 00:22:51.724
I'm just thinking
about things right now.

636
00:22:51.758 --> 00:22:53.896
I'm out there right
now and the streets

637
00:22:53.931 --> 00:22:55.758
are like. they got
nothing for you.

638
00:22:56.758 --> 00:22:58.379
It's just time.

639
00:22:58.413 --> 00:22:59.724
- Okay.

640
00:22:59.758 --> 00:23:01.482
- All right.

641
00:23:01.517 --> 00:23:02.517
- New and improved. damn.

642
00:23:04.862 --> 00:23:06.931
So. seeing somebody or what?

643
00:23:06.965 --> 00:23:08.517
- Yeah. nobody serious.

644
00:23:08.551 --> 00:23:10.000
- I see.

645
00:23:10.034 --> 00:23:11.482
- It's time for
me to get focused.

646
00:23:13.068 --> 00:23:15.827
Hey look. the game
out there is crazy.

647
00:23:15.862 --> 00:23:18.793
It's all about swipes and DMS

648
00:23:18.827 --> 00:23:20.827
and taking more
pictures of your food

649
00:23:20.862 --> 00:23:22.655
than actually eating it.

650
00:23:22.689 --> 00:23:25.689
Surveillance video. Snapgram.
y'all been on that one.

651
00:23:25.724 --> 00:23:26.965
- Snap the gram?

652
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.965
- Bro. that's two
different apps.

653
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.793
you just put 'em together
like crazy dudes.

654
00:23:30.827 --> 00:23:32.034
- Snap.

655
00:23:32.068 --> 00:23:34.103
No. wait. well hold on.

656
00:23:34.137 --> 00:23:36.034
Whoa. you said surveillance.
who are you dating bro?

657
00:23:36.068 --> 00:23:37.827
A damn undercover cop?

658
00:23:37.862 --> 00:23:39.655
- I might as well be.

659
00:23:39.689 --> 00:23:41.620
Look. you can't go to brunch
without them recording

660
00:23:41.655 --> 00:23:43.448
your every single move.

661
00:23:43.482 --> 00:23:45.103
It's like the only reason
they're on the date

662
00:23:45.137 --> 00:23:47.586
is to log on and compete
with other people

663
00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:49.620
who are also on dates.

664
00:23:49.655 --> 00:23:51.482
It's crazy.

665
00:23:51.517 --> 00:23:52.586
It's like. here we
are. here we are.

666
00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.137
- Come on.
- Okay.

667
00:23:54.172 --> 00:23:56.068
- I mean. are you
actually interested in me?

668
00:23:56.103 --> 00:23:57.758
Am I just there basically
to help you make content

669
00:23:57.793 --> 00:23:58.655
for your page.

670
00:23:58.689 --> 00:24:00.551
Just tell me.

671
00:24:00.586 --> 00:24:02.034
- Facts though.

672
00:24:02.068 --> 00:24:03.689
I mean. I get it.
you make sense.

673
00:24:03.724 --> 00:24:04.827
- I just want some
real conversation.

674
00:24:04.862 --> 00:24:06.758
Talk to me. ask me about my day.

675
00:24:08.241 --> 00:24:09.896
Ask me about my
thoughts on our people

676
00:24:09.931 --> 00:24:12.034
and how we're striving
and thriving in America.

677
00:24:13.862 --> 00:24:16.034
Stop asking me. what
kind of job you got?

678
00:24:16.068 --> 00:24:17.724
Is your bed up against the wall?

679
00:24:17.758 --> 00:24:19.758
What kind of
headboard do you have?

680
00:24:19.793 --> 00:24:20.758
- A headboard?

681
00:24:20.793 --> 00:24:21.896
Who are you dating?

682
00:24:21.931 --> 00:24:23.034
- Yeah. who are you dating bro?

683
00:24:23.068 --> 00:24:23.862
But now I-
You getting

684
00:24:23.896 --> 00:24:25.034
to my point?

685
00:24:25.068 --> 00:24:26.896
- No. I get your point. man.

686
00:24:26.931 --> 00:24:30.827
Look. I would prefer to
have brains and beauty.

687
00:24:30.862 --> 00:24:32.793
So. yeah. I get.

688
00:24:32.827 --> 00:24:34.724
- Exactly.

689
00:24:34.758 --> 00:24:36.551
- Look. I've had it all.

690
00:24:36.586 --> 00:24:40.068
And the stuff that used to
excite me just doesn't anymore.

691
00:24:40.103 --> 00:24:43.034
I mean. I'm at a place
now where I don't know.

692
00:24:43.068 --> 00:24:46.551
not looking for sex.
looking for thoughtful.

693
00:24:46.586 --> 00:24:48.724
It's just not as easy
to find as it seems.

694
00:24:50.034 --> 00:24:51.896
- Get the ham and the both.

695
00:24:51.931 --> 00:24:53.034
Thick and thoughtful.

696
00:24:54.137 --> 00:24:55.241
- Thick and thoughtful.

697
00:24:55.275 --> 00:24:56.689
- Yeah.

698
00:24:56.724 --> 00:24:58.172
- Cakes matter.

699
00:25:00.827 --> 00:25:03.655
- Look man. when
I first met Clara.

700
00:25:03.689 --> 00:25:06.241
Yeah. I don't think I was
100% ready to be honest.

701
00:25:08.241 --> 00:25:09.827
It was something about
her. she had this quality

702
00:25:09.862 --> 00:25:12.137
that I knew I just
did not wanna lose.

703
00:25:12.172 --> 00:25:14.689
Decided to marry her. best
thing I could ever done.

704
00:25:14.724 --> 00:25:16.758
- Yeah.

705
00:25:16.793 --> 00:25:18.620
- And look. she was a great
woman. man. and that's for sure.

706
00:25:18.655 --> 00:25:19.758
- Yeah.

707
00:25:19.793 --> 00:25:20.620
Thanks man.

708
00:25:20.655 --> 00:25:21.103
Yeah. it was...

709
00:25:22.655 --> 00:25:24.793
Together what. 20 years.

710
00:25:24.827 --> 00:25:26.620
Yeah.

711
00:25:26.655 --> 00:25:28.793
If I had to do that
all over again.

712
00:25:28.827 --> 00:25:30.103
the exact same way I would.

713
00:25:31.862 --> 00:25:32.965
- I miss seeing
y'all together. man.

714
00:25:34.827 --> 00:25:36.172
To hell with cancer.

715
00:25:36.206 --> 00:25:37.068
- No. man.

716
00:25:38.793 --> 00:25:39.896
The hell with cancer my man.

717
00:25:41.689 --> 00:25:43.827
- You know. she fought
that good fight though.

718
00:25:45.827 --> 00:25:49.793
It's a good thing that we
didn't leave anything I'd say.

719
00:25:49.827 --> 00:25:52.068
I'm grateful for that.
my soul's is in peace.

720
00:25:52.103 --> 00:25:54.034
- It's all done.

721
00:25:54.068 --> 00:25:54.931
- Mh-hmm.

722
00:25:56.655 --> 00:25:58.068
Now lets talk about
you. Mr. Dalton.

723
00:25:58.103 --> 00:25:58.931
- Mm-hmm.

724
00:25:58.965 --> 00:26:00.103
- Yeah.

725
00:26:00.137 --> 00:26:02.172
- How about you. Mr. Dalton?

726
00:26:02.206 --> 00:26:04.034
- You and Roz have gotten
back together for a reason.

727
00:26:04.068 --> 00:26:05.689
You're gonna work out.
everything's gonna be fine.

728
00:26:05.724 --> 00:26:06.689
but let me give you a
little word of advice.

729
00:26:06.724 --> 00:26:08.379
Don't let it go.

730
00:26:08.413 --> 00:26:12.034
Don't compromise. no
matter what. hold onto it.

731
00:26:13.275 --> 00:26:15.034
You hear me?

732
00:26:15.068 --> 00:26:16.137
- I'm listening.

733
00:26:16.172 --> 00:26:17.000
- Hold on.

734
00:26:20.344 --> 00:26:22.827
- If it was up to me bro.
we wouldn't have broken up

735
00:26:22.862 --> 00:26:23.827
in the first place.

736
00:26:25.172 --> 00:26:26.275
- I hear you.

737
00:26:27.931 --> 00:26:29.275
She probably left you

738
00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:30.689
'cause you got a
flathead screwdrivers.

739
00:26:32.241 --> 00:26:33.862
Can I get a fill up
something here. bro?

740
00:26:33.896 --> 00:26:35.862
- Who gets drunk
with a flat head.

741
00:26:35.896 --> 00:26:37.310
- It's not the screwdriver man.

742
00:26:37.344 --> 00:26:39.034
We'll need the pliers
to hold the both down.

743
00:26:39.068 --> 00:26:40.103
I gotta get to the garage.

744
00:26:41.827 --> 00:26:42.344
- Well. okay.

745
00:26:42.379 --> 00:26:43.241
- I'll be back.

746
00:26:43.275 --> 00:26:44.241
- Yeah. of course.

747
00:26:44.275 --> 00:26:46.275
Let me go get it.

748
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:47.068
You got us doing the
work. this ain't my crib.

749
00:26:47.103 --> 00:26:49.034
I ain't got no babies.

750
00:26:49.068 --> 00:26:51.103
we put a crib together
in like 20 years. man.

751
00:26:53.068 --> 00:26:54.896
Tag on instructions bro. I
don't know what this thing is.

752
00:26:54.931 --> 00:26:56.689
- If the baby fall.
I'm blaming you.

753
00:26:59.172 --> 00:27:00.241
That's what I just
saw on YouTube.

754
00:27:07.172 --> 00:27:08.758
- Where did I put that thing?

755
00:27:23.241 --> 00:27:24.241
Yeah.

756
00:27:50.103 --> 00:27:51.793
Yeah. what are you doing?

757
00:27:53.827 --> 00:27:55.896
- Uh-uh. and you better
not lie to me little girl.

758
00:27:55.931 --> 00:27:57.000
- I can explain.

759
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.448
- Well. get to explain it 'cause
you ain't said nothing yet.

760
00:28:01.482 --> 00:28:04.275
Uh-uh. what you hiding
behind your back?

761
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:06.137
Where did you get
that gift from?

762
00:28:06.172 --> 00:28:08.862
- Well. this guy wanted
me to meet him somewhere.

763
00:28:08.896 --> 00:28:09.344
- Him?

764
00:28:10.896 --> 00:28:13.000
Who is him. Esta?

765
00:28:13.034 --> 00:28:14.931
- Well. my boyfriend.

766
00:28:17.344 --> 00:28:19.172
- Your boyfriend.

767
00:28:19.206 --> 00:28:21.034
I thought we already agreed.

768
00:28:21.068 --> 00:28:23.068
No boyfriends. Esta.

769
00:28:23.103 --> 00:28:25.172
You're too young.

770
00:28:25.206 --> 00:28:27.137
- But dad. I'm about to be
a junior in a few months.

771
00:28:27.172 --> 00:28:29.862
I can handle this and school.
I'm not a little baby anymore.

772
00:28:29.896 --> 00:28:31.793
- Oh you can handle it. huh?

773
00:28:31.827 --> 00:28:33.310
Ever since you've been talking
about this little boyfriend.

774
00:28:33.344 --> 00:28:35.275
you've been less than honest

775
00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:37.310
and you've sure done lost focus.

776
00:28:37.344 --> 00:28:39.965
and now you sneaking
around in my house.

777
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.103
I don't like that. I didn't
raise you like this. Esta.

778
00:28:43.137 --> 00:28:45.310
Well. dad. I didn't
mean to sneak around.

779
00:28:45.344 --> 00:28:48.965
I just knew that if I'd asked
you for him to come here.

780
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.827
you wouldn't allow him to come.

781
00:28:50.862 --> 00:28:53.103
- So. why did you do it. huh?

782
00:28:53.137 --> 00:28:54.103
Why did you do it then?

783
00:28:55.862 --> 00:28:57.310
- Well. I'm sorry dad.

784
00:29:03.413 --> 00:29:07.034
- Well. I'm sorry too. okay.

785
00:29:07.068 --> 00:29:08.379
No. look at me.

786
00:29:08.413 --> 00:29:10.896
Look. I want you
to feel comfortable

787
00:29:10.931 --> 00:29:14.172
that you can come to me
about anything. all right?

788
00:29:14.206 --> 00:29:17.034
Whether I agree with you or not.

789
00:29:17.068 --> 00:29:18.000
Okay?

790
00:29:19.103 --> 00:29:20.551
- I'm sorry dad.

791
00:29:20.586 --> 00:29:22.206
And I won't ever do
this again. I promise.

792
00:29:22.241 --> 00:29:24.034
- Yeah. you better not.

793
00:29:26.068 --> 00:29:29.034
Look. I can't even
believe I'm about to say this.

794
00:29:29.068 --> 00:29:33.206
but I will entertain
the little thought

795
00:29:33.241 --> 00:29:35.034
of you having a boyfriend.

796
00:29:35.931 --> 00:29:37.206
- You will?

797
00:29:37.241 --> 00:29:38.482
- Only if I approve of him.

798
00:29:40.241 --> 00:29:42.206
So. before you meet
up with him again.

799
00:29:42.241 --> 00:29:44.000
you need to introduce him to me.

800
00:29:44.034 --> 00:29:45.068
Okay. the right way.

801
00:29:45.103 --> 00:29:46.034
- How about on Christmas?

802
00:29:48.206 --> 00:29:50.000
- Yeah. that's for sure.

803
00:29:50.034 --> 00:29:52.034
I will meet your
little punk boyfriend

804
00:29:52.068 --> 00:29:54.172
on Christmas Day. okay?

805
00:29:54.206 --> 00:29:55.275
- All right. cool.

806
00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:56.172
Thank you dad.

807
00:29:58.034 --> 00:30:00.379
- Girl. I swear-
- There you are.

808
00:30:00.413 --> 00:30:02.241
Where have you been?

809
00:30:02.275 --> 00:30:04.034
I've been looking for
you for over an hour?

810
00:30:04.068 --> 00:30:05.172
- You know-

811
00:30:05.206 --> 00:30:07.034
- She was upstairs with us.

812
00:30:07.068 --> 00:30:08.896
helping with the crib
and the baby room.

813
00:30:08.931 --> 00:30:12.034
- Well I need you downstairs.
not upstairs on crib duty.

814
00:30:12.068 --> 00:30:13.413
You're gonna be up all night

815
00:30:13.448 --> 00:30:15.034
if you don't get
started soon. come on.

816
00:30:15.068 --> 00:30:16.172
- Yes.
- Yes. mom.

817
00:30:16.206 --> 00:30:17.172
I will get started right away.

818
00:30:17.206 --> 00:30:18.172
- Listen to your mama.

819
00:30:18.206 --> 00:30:20.034
- And Dalton. the store.

820
00:30:20.068 --> 00:30:21.275
It's Christmas Eve. it may
close early. I need you to go.

821
00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:23.241
- Oh. yeah. yeah. I forgot.

822
00:30:23.275 --> 00:30:25.551
You said you was gonna
give me the list.

823
00:30:25.586 --> 00:30:28.172
- I'll text you. you
think you can manage?

824
00:30:28.206 --> 00:30:30.931
- Girl. I done went to
the store for you before.

825
00:30:30.965 --> 00:30:33.034
you taught me better than that.

826
00:30:33.068 --> 00:30:33.586
- I did. didn't I?

827
00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:35.000
- Yeah.

828
00:30:35.034 --> 00:30:35.517
- Okay. get to it.

829
00:30:39.931 --> 00:30:40.551
Girl..

830
00:30:54.413 --> 00:30:57.068
Y'all still in here
struggling. ain't y'all?

831
00:30:57.103 --> 00:30:59.068
Look. wife
said I gotta go

832
00:30:59.103 --> 00:31:00.103
to the store for a minute.

833
00:31:00.137 --> 00:31:02.275
So. I brought the tools.

834
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:04.137
Can y'all please finish
the crib for me. man?

835
00:31:04.172 --> 00:31:05.448
- Isn't that convenient?

836
00:31:05.482 --> 00:31:06.413
- Yeah. I'm saying-
- Please?

837
00:31:06.448 --> 00:31:08.103
Do that for your brother. man.

838
00:31:09.379 --> 00:31:10.344
I'll be right back.

839
00:31:10.379 --> 00:31:11.241
- And he walks out.

840
00:31:12.413 --> 00:31:13.379
Okay.
- Just like his dad.

841
00:31:13.413 --> 00:31:15.103
- That's your brother.

842
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.206
Hi honey.

843
00:31:56.241 --> 00:31:57.586
Mind if I come in?

844
00:31:57.620 --> 00:31:59.344
- You don't even
have to ask. come on.

845
00:31:59.379 --> 00:32:03.724
Oh my goodness.

846
00:32:03.758 --> 00:32:07.034
Oh. my feet could use
some TLC right about now.

847
00:32:08.068 --> 00:32:09.482
- You can use it next.

848
00:32:09.517 --> 00:32:11.172
- No. you need it
more than me. baby.

849
00:32:11.206 --> 00:32:12.310
So. are you ready?

850
00:32:14.068 --> 00:32:15.482
- More than you know?

851
00:32:15.517 --> 00:32:16.344
- Oh. I know.

852
00:32:16.379 --> 00:32:17.344
Trust.

853
00:32:19.068 --> 00:32:19.655
- How you holding up?

854
00:32:21.724 --> 00:32:26.034
- Well. now that I'm face to
face with you. I'm just fine.

855
00:32:26.068 --> 00:32:27.034
Yes.
- I told you

856
00:32:27.068 --> 00:32:28.448
not to worry about me.

857
00:32:28.482 --> 00:32:30.137
- You tried doing
that. I'm your mother.

858
00:32:31.551 --> 00:32:34.000
You know. I have to say it.

859
00:32:36.068 --> 00:32:38.344
but last year it was such
a challenging year for you.

860
00:32:38.379 --> 00:32:40.137
with the divorce.
and I hated that-

861
00:32:40.172 --> 00:32:41.103
- Oh. mama.
- I couldn't be here.

862
00:32:41.137 --> 00:32:42.172
for what?

863
00:32:42.206 --> 00:32:43.344
- I was fine.

864
00:32:43.379 --> 00:32:45.482
I needed the alone time.

865
00:32:45.517 --> 00:32:47.172
It worked out well though.

866
00:32:47.206 --> 00:32:48.172
- Oh it did.

867
00:32:51.379 --> 00:32:55.172
You know. you and
Dalton remind me so much

868
00:32:55.206 --> 00:32:57.172
of me and your father.

869
00:32:58.758 --> 00:32:59.620
- Yeah?

870
00:33:01.068 --> 00:33:02.620
How so?

871
00:33:02.655 --> 00:33:05.586
Well. let's see
where do I start.

872
00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:12.379
When I was your age.
I was very ambitious.

873
00:33:12.413 --> 00:33:14.517
Oh. when I was headstrong

874
00:33:14.551 --> 00:33:17.551
and your father hated
it most of the time.

875
00:33:17.586 --> 00:33:20.103
because my decisions
were not always right.

876
00:33:20.137 --> 00:33:22.206
- Yeah. but you stuck
around though. right?

877
00:33:22.241 --> 00:33:24.172
- Because I'm an excellent cook.

878
00:33:24.206 --> 00:33:25.068
- You are.

879
00:33:26.827 --> 00:33:31.241
- But seriously. I don't
know if I ever told you this.

880
00:33:33.068 --> 00:33:36.344
but daddy threatened to
leave a number of times.

881
00:33:36.379 --> 00:33:40.068
And then one day
he actually did.

882
00:33:41.689 --> 00:33:42.517
- What?

883
00:33:42.551 --> 00:33:44.034
Dad left?

884
00:33:44.068 --> 00:33:44.724
- Yeah.

885
00:33:46.379 --> 00:33:49.241
He packed up his old leather bag

886
00:33:49.275 --> 00:33:51.758
and he got himself a hotel room.

887
00:33:51.793 --> 00:33:54.551
And you know. I just thought
I was gonna just wait it out.

888
00:33:56.620 --> 00:34:00.482
but no. in those few weeks
that your father was gone.

889
00:34:02.517 --> 00:34:06.827
I learned that life wasn't
worth living without him.

890
00:34:08.655 --> 00:34:10.827
Just wasn't worth it.

891
00:34:10.862 --> 00:34:13.517
it wasn't worth being
right all the time.

892
00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:17.448
- What are you
trying to tell me?

893
00:34:19.172 --> 00:34:20.551
- Honey. I'm not
telling you anything

894
00:34:20.586 --> 00:34:22.137
you don't already know.

895
00:34:24.344 --> 00:34:26.103
I'm just sharing a story

896
00:34:27.655 --> 00:34:30.827
about how I almost lost
what mattered most.

897
00:34:32.655 --> 00:34:34.103
And I didn't need
to be in control.

898
00:34:39.103 --> 00:34:39.793
- Wow.

899
00:34:41.793 --> 00:34:45.758
- Listen. I'm gonna get
some rest before this dinner

900
00:34:45.793 --> 00:34:48.689
and we're gonna have to
deal with the crazy Pete.

901
00:34:48.724 --> 00:34:53.344
- And his mouth and
Esta's ears. my goodness.

902
00:34:54.586 --> 00:34:56.689
I'm glad you came up.

903
00:34:56.724 --> 00:35:00.344
- Me too. I want what's
best for you. honey.

904
00:35:00.379 --> 00:35:01.344
- I love you.

905
00:35:01.379 --> 00:35:02.310
- I love you.

906
00:35:06.758 --> 00:35:09.689
- And that grandbaby
growing every day.

907
00:35:09.724 --> 00:35:10.655
- Isn't he?

908
00:35:14.689 --> 00:35:15.517
Okay.

909
00:35:15.551 --> 00:35:16.344
- Bye.

910
00:35:16.379 --> 00:35:17.206
- Bye.

911
00:35:35.517 --> 00:35:36.931
- Yeah. you know. I want to man.

912
00:35:36.965 --> 00:35:38.862
but I can't because of
the baby and all that.

913
00:35:38.896 --> 00:35:41.172
Look. trust me. I know
I said that last year.

914
00:35:41.206 --> 00:35:43.448
but look. this year we gonna
make it happen. all right?

915
00:35:43.482 --> 00:35:44.413
The whole family.

916
00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:46.172
Hold on. man.

917
00:35:47.413 --> 00:35:48.241
I gotta call you back bro.

918
00:35:49.724 --> 00:35:52.206
- Hey. let me help
you with this.

919
00:35:52.241 --> 00:35:53.344
- No. no. no. no.

920
00:35:53.379 --> 00:35:54.172
- It's all good.

921
00:35:54.206 --> 00:35:55.551
Here!

922
00:35:55.586 --> 00:35:56.344
- You ain't gotta do that.

923
00:35:56.379 --> 00:35:57.551
- No. no. trust me.

924
00:35:57.586 --> 00:35:58.689
- The struggle is real.

925
00:35:58.724 --> 00:36:00.379
Yes it is. yes it is.

926
00:36:00.413 --> 00:36:03.413
Let me guess your wife
sent you on a store.

927
00:36:03.448 --> 00:36:04.551
- Is it that obvious?

928
00:36:04.586 --> 00:36:06.862
Yeah. just a little.

929
00:36:06.896 --> 00:36:08.724
- Yeah.

930
00:36:08.758 --> 00:36:10.413
- But I get it though.
we've all been there.

931
00:36:10.448 --> 00:36:11.448
- That's why you here too?

932
00:36:12.896 --> 00:36:15.655
- Actually I lost my
wife some time ago.

933
00:36:17.413 --> 00:36:18.793
Oh. I'm sorry man.
I didn't know.

934
00:36:18.827 --> 00:36:21.448
- No. no. no reason
to feel sorry.

935
00:36:21.482 --> 00:36:23.827
she's in a better place now.

936
00:36:25.758 --> 00:36:27.551
But so every Christmas.

937
00:36:27.586 --> 00:36:30.965
I try to remake her
corn. Casaro.

938
00:36:32.793 --> 00:36:34.448
Doesn't always turn
out as good as hers.

939
00:36:34.482 --> 00:36:38.689
but it always reminds
me of the good times.

940
00:36:38.724 --> 00:36:40.241
- Yeah. that's good.

941
00:36:40.275 --> 00:36:41.413
- Yeah.

942
00:36:41.448 --> 00:36:43.551
- I bet it does.

943
00:36:43.586 --> 00:36:45.586
- No. nowadays families are
so distant with each other.

944
00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:47.827
it's not always my choice.

945
00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:51.965
See. life goes on. we
create our own families.

946
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.793
or as people pass away. we
just fellowship less and less.

947
00:36:58.827 --> 00:37:02.275
It's like for that life to get
in the way of a connection.

948
00:37:03.379 --> 00:37:04.793
- That's right.

949
00:37:04.827 --> 00:37:06.689
No. it's funny
that you say that.

950
00:37:06.724 --> 00:37:08.551
I literally was just talking
to my cousin on the phone.

951
00:37:08.586 --> 00:37:10.827
You know. family hadn't
been together a long time.

952
00:37:11.862 --> 00:37:13.827
Everybody's all spread out.

953
00:37:13.862 --> 00:37:15.448
Time is never just right.

954
00:37:15.482 --> 00:37:16.482
- Yeah. yeah. I know.

955
00:37:16.517 --> 00:37:18.655
Trust me. I know.

956
00:37:18.689 --> 00:37:21.551
And you just can't
please everyone.

957
00:37:21.586 --> 00:37:23.344
- Facts. facts.

958
00:37:23.379 --> 00:37:24.517
Finally somebody who gets it.

959
00:37:25.896 --> 00:37:28.517
- But I'd like to say that.

960
00:37:28.551 --> 00:37:31.344
if you are blessed
to have family

961
00:37:31.379 --> 00:37:33.344
that still have
air in their lungs.

962
00:37:35.379 --> 00:37:38.000
love on them.
fellowship with them.

963
00:37:39.724 --> 00:37:41.482
no matter what
life throws at you.

964
00:37:41.517 --> 00:37:43.689
always make time for your own.

965
00:37:45.758 --> 00:37:47.862
'Cause there will be a day
and there's no time left.

966
00:37:49.655 --> 00:37:51.620
So. you have to create
those memories now.

967
00:37:55.379 --> 00:37:56.275
- Yes. sir.

968
00:37:58.655 --> 00:38:00.965
Sorry man. I gotta get
back to the wife man.

969
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.620
- Oh. yeah.
- So I'll keep going.

970
00:38:02.655 --> 00:38:03.724
Thank you for that word.

971
00:38:03.758 --> 00:38:05.586
- Yeah. you're welcome.

972
00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:07.551
- You have a Merry
Christmas. man.

973
00:38:07.586 --> 00:38:08.034
- You too.

974
00:38:09.586 --> 00:38:10.689
- I'll go on.

975
00:38:12.586 --> 00:38:13.413
- Take care. Dalton.

976
00:38:24.793 --> 00:38:28.344
Man. I must be sleep
deprived. I'm tripping.

977
00:38:44.034 --> 00:38:46.586
- Fill me up. give me some more.

978
00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:47.689
- Mama did her thing.

979
00:38:47.724 --> 00:38:48.551
- Did she?

980
00:38:49.965 --> 00:38:52.034
- Listen. for the last time.

981
00:38:52.068 --> 00:38:55.586
you do not put sugar
in grits. period.

982
00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:57.034
- No. hold up.

983
00:38:57.068 --> 00:38:58.586
You don't know what
you're missing.

984
00:38:58.620 --> 00:38:59.586
- Oh. I know exactly
what I'm missing

985
00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:00.655
and I'm fine with that.

986
00:39:00.689 --> 00:39:02.137
Miss me all the way.

987
00:39:02.172 --> 00:39:04.827
Everybody. butter. salt
and pepper. that's it.

988
00:39:06.862 --> 00:39:08.931
- You probably think
spaghetti is an entree too?

989
00:39:08.965 --> 00:39:10.724
- Yes. spaghetti's a
full and delicious meal.

990
00:39:10.758 --> 00:39:12.482
- Hey. well hold on.

991
00:39:12.517 --> 00:39:13.655
I'm coming to my
brother defense now.

992
00:39:13.689 --> 00:39:14.827
- What.
- Thank you.

993
00:39:14.862 --> 00:39:16.034
Depends on where you travel.

994
00:39:16.068 --> 00:39:18.620
some places consider
spaghetti a side.

995
00:39:18.655 --> 00:39:20.896
- Yes. Pam was on
fire. fish baby.

996
00:39:23.103 --> 00:39:24.689
- Well then. depending
on where you go.

997
00:39:24.724 --> 00:39:26.758
macaroni and cheese
is also an entree.

998
00:39:26.793 --> 00:39:28.137
that don't make it right.

999
00:39:28.172 --> 00:39:30.517
- But how did this
even become a topic?

1000
00:39:30.551 --> 00:39:32.827
- You Roz. when you
threatened to poison us

1001
00:39:32.862 --> 00:39:34.482
with your sugar regrets.

1002
00:39:34.517 --> 00:39:35.931
- Oh no.

1003
00:39:35.965 --> 00:39:36.827
Poison.

1004
00:39:36.862 --> 00:39:37.827
- Poisons?
- Okay.

1005
00:39:37.862 --> 00:39:38.827
- Oh no. he didn't.

1006
00:39:38.862 --> 00:39:39.965
No. he didn't.

1007
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.862
- I remember when your big mama

1008
00:39:41.896 --> 00:39:44.482
used to wake the house
up with her grits.

1009
00:39:44.517 --> 00:39:45.655
the eggs. the bacons.

1010
00:39:45.689 --> 00:39:47.931
- Yeah. the bacon and pork.

1011
00:39:47.965 --> 00:39:49.655
man. you gotta add fried now.

1012
00:39:53.724 --> 00:39:56.034
- Lord. I wish I could
wake up to some bacon now.

1013
00:39:56.068 --> 00:39:57.827
- Oh.

1014
00:39:57.862 --> 00:39:59.172
- Only thing I'm
waking up to is vegan.

1015
00:39:59.206 --> 00:40:00.827
frosted flakes and
some damn almond milk.

1016
00:40:00.862 --> 00:40:02.482
- Okay. Dalton. whatever.

1017
00:40:02.517 --> 00:40:03.586
It's good for you.

1018
00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:04.724
- I'm not a vegan.

1019
00:40:04.758 --> 00:40:06.793
- It's healthier for you.

1020
00:40:06.827 --> 00:40:09.448
A little plant based vibes
never killed anybody.

1021
00:40:09.482 --> 00:40:10.793
- What?

1022
00:40:10.827 --> 00:40:12.000
- Actually that's not true

1023
00:40:12.034 --> 00:40:13.965
because cardboard
is also plant based.

1024
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.482
- Help me. please help me.

1025
00:40:16.517 --> 00:40:18.793
- You are so chaotic tonight.

1026
00:40:18.827 --> 00:40:20.655
I cook. okay?

1027
00:40:20.689 --> 00:40:22.620
I just threw down in the
kitchen the other day.

1028
00:40:22.655 --> 00:40:24.000
all by myself.

1029
00:40:24.034 --> 00:40:25.517
She almost burnt
the house.

1030
00:40:26.965 --> 00:40:29.000
Hey.

1031
00:40:32.793 --> 00:40:34.517
- Uh-uh.

1032
00:40:34.551 --> 00:40:35.517
- Then She said. look.
smoke everything.

1033
00:40:35.551 --> 00:40:37.172
- Wait. wait. wait.

1034
00:40:37.206 --> 00:40:39.034
Don't tell me you are
over here like a cave man.

1035
00:40:39.068 --> 00:40:40.827
and you just want your
woman barefoot and pregnant

1036
00:40:40.862 --> 00:40:42.482
and waiting on you
here. the fuck bro.

1037
00:40:42.517 --> 00:40:44.517
No. come on now.
bro. come on now.

1038
00:40:44.551 --> 00:40:46.517
- Whoa. slow down sis.
don't do me like that.

1039
00:40:46.551 --> 00:40:48.827
You know how I feel about my-

1040
00:40:48.862 --> 00:40:50.482
- Hey. look D. I'm with you man.

1041
00:40:50.517 --> 00:40:52.620
That's how it is.
the 50/50 always.

1042
00:40:52.655 --> 00:40:55.931
- No in my house.
ain't no 50/50. bro.

1043
00:40:55.965 --> 00:40:58.482
Everybody holds their
own weight 100%.

1044
00:40:58.517 --> 00:40:59.758
- 100%. boo-yah.

1045
00:40:59.793 --> 00:41:01.689
- A hundred on Roz.

1046
00:41:01.724 --> 00:41:03.103
- Honey. I know I've asked
you this 1.000 times.

1047
00:41:03.137 --> 00:41:05.896
but I know you're excited

1048
00:41:05.931 --> 00:41:08.551
about the baby coming
around the corner.

1049
00:41:08.586 --> 00:41:10.206
So. tell me again.
when's the due date?

1050
00:41:10.241 --> 00:41:13.655
- Next week and it
can't come fast enough.

1051
00:41:13.689 --> 00:41:16.586
I feel like there's an
alien invasion in my body.

1052
00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:17.724
I want it out.

1053
00:41:17.758 --> 00:41:18.896
I like you pregnant.

1054
00:41:20.931 --> 00:41:22.586
- It will all come
back together.

1055
00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:24.034
but when's the doula coming?

1056
00:41:24.068 --> 00:41:25.724
- Oh. well. what's
the heck is a doula.

1057
00:41:26.965 --> 00:41:28.724
- She helps the midwife fool.

1058
00:41:30.724 --> 00:41:31.862
- What's a midwife?

1059
00:41:31.896 --> 00:41:34.724
- Don't worry about it. just...

1060
00:41:34.758 --> 00:41:36.206
- I actually-
- I don't know you.

1061
00:41:36.241 --> 00:41:39.689
- The doula helps keep
me calm and relaxed.

1062
00:41:39.724 --> 00:41:41.758
It's the midwife who
will help me give birth

1063
00:41:41.793 --> 00:41:43.034
right here at home.

1064
00:41:43.068 --> 00:41:45.034
And don't worry mama.

1065
00:41:45.068 --> 00:41:47.034
she'll keep me safe
through the entire process.

1066
00:41:47.068 --> 00:41:48.896
- All right.

1067
00:41:48.931 --> 00:41:50.758
- She's out of town this
weekend for Christmas.

1068
00:41:50.793 --> 00:41:52.206
but she'll be back in time
for me to go into labor.

1069
00:41:52.241 --> 00:41:55.758
- Well. look. my hats
off to all the ladies.

1070
00:41:55.793 --> 00:41:58.758
because that sounds way
too complicated for me.

1071
00:41:58.793 --> 00:42:02.068
- Yes. bringing a baby into
the world is such a blessing.

1072
00:42:02.103 --> 00:42:04.103
it's of no understanding.

1073
00:42:04.137 --> 00:42:07.103
And then you feel that
baby going inside of you.

1074
00:42:07.137 --> 00:42:08.862
and then it takes
its first breath.

1075
00:42:08.896 --> 00:42:10.620
It's so surreal.

1076
00:42:10.655 --> 00:42:12.965
- And that's how
me and Claire felt.

1077
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.896
went on our first child.

1078
00:42:14.931 --> 00:42:17.827
I don't know if I remember. I
was like on sensory overload.

1079
00:42:17.862 --> 00:42:20.758
I thought I was gonna
pass the hell out. man.

1080
00:42:20.793 --> 00:42:22.655
- I was there.

1081
00:42:22.689 --> 00:42:23.965
We still got that on tape. man.

1082
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.724
- You know. it's crazy.

1083
00:42:25.758 --> 00:42:26.827
- Remember that?

1084
00:42:26.862 --> 00:42:27.827
- First one. we'll do it.

1085
00:42:27.862 --> 00:42:29.275
- Yeah. the first one.

1086
00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:30.965
- Yeah. so. for the
life of you me then.

1087
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.172
why are you having the
baby here at the house?

1088
00:42:32.206 --> 00:42:33.172
When you can have the
baby at the hospital

1089
00:42:33.206 --> 00:42:35.275
like everybody else?

1090
00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:36.793
- I don't wanna have it in the
hospital during the holidays.

1091
00:42:36.827 --> 00:42:38.724
like everybody else.

1092
00:42:38.758 --> 00:42:41.103
Mama I wanna be sleeping
right here on my own bed.

1093
00:42:41.137 --> 00:42:42.965
- Well. what if the baby stand?

1094
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.034
- But what if the baby
comes pretty early.

1095
00:42:44.068 --> 00:42:45.275
like at the dinner table.

1096
00:42:48.034 --> 00:42:49.931
- We are blessed and
covered up in this house.

1097
00:42:49.965 --> 00:42:51.758
- Yeah. thank you.

1098
00:42:51.793 --> 00:42:53.827
- And plus mama's a
doctor. she can...

1099
00:42:53.862 --> 00:42:54.758
- Whoa. whoa. whoa.

1100
00:42:54.793 --> 00:42:56.931
- I am retired.

1101
00:42:56.965 --> 00:43:00.000
I have delivered enough
babies to last me a lifetime.

1102
00:43:00.034 --> 00:43:02.034
I have no intention of
delivering another baby.

1103
00:43:02.068 --> 00:43:03.793
even if it is my
grandson. I'm sorry.

1104
00:43:03.827 --> 00:43:05.896
- Well. mama. you won't have to.

1105
00:43:05.931 --> 00:43:08.034
Esta came out late
and this little guy

1106
00:43:08.068 --> 00:43:09.793
will probably be the same way.

1107
00:43:09.827 --> 00:43:11.172
- Hey. whoa. whoa. whoa.

1108
00:43:11.206 --> 00:43:12.758
Don't be trying
to text me up man

1109
00:43:12.793 --> 00:43:14.344
- That no wood.

1110
00:43:14.379 --> 00:43:16.000
- Wait. be careful man.
knocking at wood. man.

1111
00:43:16.034 --> 00:43:17.068
You don't know what
kind of spirits

1112
00:43:17.103 --> 00:43:18.655
you gonna conjure up doing that.

1113
00:43:18.689 --> 00:43:19.310
Careful.

1114
00:43:21.068 --> 00:43:23.034
- Get outta here with
that superstitious crap.

1115
00:43:23.068 --> 00:43:25.689
I don't believe in that
voodoo mumbo jumbo man.

1116
00:43:26.724 --> 00:43:27.896
- Okay. man.

1117
00:43:27.931 --> 00:43:29.758
Your house. your ghost.

1118
00:43:31.689 --> 00:43:33.000
So. now we
gotta go.

1119
00:43:33.034 --> 00:43:34.000
Correct.

1120
00:43:34.034 --> 00:43:36.137
Here it goes.

1121
00:43:36.172 --> 00:43:38.827
- So. tell me is your boy
toy feeling lonely again?

1122
00:43:40.827 --> 00:43:43.137
- You know I. I swear that
just must be some type

1123
00:43:43.172 --> 00:43:45.172
of condition for you to just

1124
00:43:45.206 --> 00:43:47.068
not be able to mind
your own business.

1125
00:43:47.103 --> 00:43:50.689
You know. you should seek help.

1126
00:43:50.724 --> 00:43:52.965
- And maybe you should
stop trolling rap concerts.

1127
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.000
looking for love.

1128
00:43:54.034 --> 00:43:55.862
Get you a real man.

1129
00:43:55.896 --> 00:43:57.137
you know one that doesn't
bank on the Cash App.

1130
00:43:59.034 --> 00:44:00.000
- Oh my. uh-oh...

1131
00:44:00.034 --> 00:44:01.172
A real man?

1132
00:44:01.206 --> 00:44:02.965
- Yeah.
- Like you?

1133
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.068
A washed up athlete.
still living vicariously

1134
00:44:05.103 --> 00:44:07.758
through his Michigan days
falsely believing that

1135
00:44:07.793 --> 00:44:09.241
40 is the new 30.

1136
00:44:09.275 --> 00:44:10.931
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

1137
00:44:10.965 --> 00:44:11.689
Guess what?

1138
00:44:12.758 --> 00:44:14.862
It's not.

1139
00:44:14.896 --> 00:44:16.068
- Bro. you're gonna let
her talk to you like that?

1140
00:44:18.931 --> 00:44:21.034
- Roz is having a baby.
insults are out of the way.

1141
00:44:21.068 --> 00:44:21.896
How about some dessert?

1142
00:44:21.931 --> 00:44:22.896
Dessert?

1143
00:44:22.931 --> 00:44:24.758
- You know what?

1144
00:44:24.793 --> 00:44:26.034
I'll take some pie.
just pass that along.

1145
00:44:26.068 --> 00:44:27.034
We need some
sweetness going on at.

1146
00:44:27.068 --> 00:44:28.758
- 40 is the new 30.

1147
00:44:28.793 --> 00:44:29.758
- That's what I'm saying.

1148
00:44:31.068 --> 00:44:32.034
- You still got it.

1149
00:44:32.068 --> 00:44:33.241
- I never lost it bruh.

1150
00:44:36.103 --> 00:44:36.931
- You're not listening.

1151
00:44:40.896 --> 00:44:42.793
- Home made. mama?

1152
00:45:02.034 --> 00:45:04.275
- Why am I not surprised
you would be down here

1153
00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:07.310
hauling up all the good snacks.

1154
00:45:07.344 --> 00:45:10.068
- Why am I not surprised
your hound senses

1155
00:45:10.103 --> 00:45:11.275
could sniff them out.

1156
00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:12.172
- Ooh.

1157
00:45:13.275 --> 00:45:14.896
- Care to play?

1158
00:45:14.931 --> 00:45:16.862
- Ladies thirst.

1159
00:45:16.896 --> 00:45:18.241
But hey. hey...

1160
00:45:18.275 --> 00:45:19.827
Let me show you what it is-
- Wow.

1161
00:45:19.862 --> 00:45:21.068
so they didn't teach
you how to share

1162
00:45:21.103 --> 00:45:22.241
in grade school either.

1163
00:45:22.275 --> 00:45:23.448
- Maybe. maybe not.

1164
00:45:25.275 --> 00:45:26.241
Let me show you what
to do. and watch it.

1165
00:45:26.275 --> 00:45:27.103
- Aim for the middle.

1166
00:45:27.137 --> 00:45:28.827
- Shut up.

1167
00:45:28.862 --> 00:45:29.448
Come out of my way.

1168
00:45:32.310 --> 00:45:36.137
I hate this game.

1169
00:45:36.172 --> 00:45:36.827
- Yeah. I hate you too.

1170
00:45:36.862 --> 00:45:38.137
- Shut up.

1171
00:45:38.172 --> 00:45:39.310
Let me ask you a question?

1172
00:45:40.241 --> 00:45:42.034
- Shoot.

1173
00:45:42.068 --> 00:45:44.310
- What do you think
about our siblings

1174
00:45:44.344 --> 00:45:46.241
getting back together
again after you know?

1175
00:45:49.137 --> 00:45:50.413
- Honestly?

1176
00:45:52.034 --> 00:45:52.758
- No. lie to me.

1177
00:45:54.137 --> 00:45:56.103
- Okay. you still got it Lisa.

1178
00:45:56.137 --> 00:45:57.103
- One point for Lisa.

1179
00:45:57.137 --> 00:45:59.172
- Yeah. a point for Lisa.

1180
00:46:01.241 --> 00:46:04.034
Look. so you wanna disrespect
me in front of the family.

1181
00:46:05.344 --> 00:46:06.206
and now you want my opinion?

1182
00:46:06.241 --> 00:46:07.206
- I'm sorry.

1183
00:46:07.241 --> 00:46:08.344
- Well. here it is.

1184
00:46:08.379 --> 00:46:10.482
- I don't think about it.

1185
00:46:10.517 --> 00:46:12.931
Roz is a great woman and
my brother's a decent guy.

1186
00:46:12.965 --> 00:46:13.413
That's it.

1187
00:46:15.172 --> 00:46:16.344
- I mean. but is that
good enough reason

1188
00:46:16.379 --> 00:46:17.896
for them to get
back together again

1189
00:46:17.931 --> 00:46:19.551
after they separated though?

1190
00:46:19.586 --> 00:46:22.379
- They didn't separate
Lisa. they got divorced.

1191
00:46:22.413 --> 00:46:24.000
- Same thing. you
know what I mean.

1192
00:46:24.034 --> 00:46:25.310
- No.

1193
00:46:25.344 --> 00:46:25.862
- They're not married anymore.

1194
00:46:25.896 --> 00:46:27.413
- No.

1195
00:46:27.448 --> 00:46:29.137
Look. I get you.
but I don't get you.

1196
00:46:29.172 --> 00:46:32.034
Listen. from what I know.

1197
00:46:32.068 --> 00:46:36.034
they didn't split up over
some disrespect or craziness.

1198
00:46:36.068 --> 00:46:37.896
- No.

1199
00:46:37.931 --> 00:46:39.482
- They just went on the
same page. that's it?

1200
00:46:41.413 --> 00:46:43.896
You know. sometimes
things have to fall apart

1201
00:46:43.931 --> 00:46:47.034
to get put back together the
way they should have been.

1202
00:46:47.068 --> 00:46:47.896
it's life.

1203
00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:50.379
- I guess you're right.

1204
00:46:52.172 --> 00:46:53.344
Everybody loves a
good comeback story.

1205
00:46:55.241 --> 00:46:57.034
- Yeah. especially me.

1206
00:46:57.068 --> 00:46:58.137
Speaking of which.

1207
00:46:59.931 --> 00:47:04.275
- Ooh. trash. trash.
I'm watching trash.

1208
00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:05.965
- Why is it so windy out here?

1209
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.517
I just. wow.

1210
00:47:08.551 --> 00:47:10.275
- Move. move. move.

1211
00:47:10.310 --> 00:47:12.103
- Just so you know. the
circle in the middle

1212
00:47:12.137 --> 00:47:13.275
is where you wanna be.
- Shut up.

1213
00:47:13.310 --> 00:47:14.068
I need quiet. I need quiet.

1214
00:47:14.103 --> 00:47:15.034
- Quick. so.

1215
00:47:17.586 --> 00:47:21.413
I'm so
sick of you right now.

1216
00:47:21.448 --> 00:47:24.448
I mean that counts. but
only if you're in Canada.

1217
00:47:24.482 --> 00:47:26.586
Here we go. watch this bullseye.

1218
00:47:28.103 --> 00:47:30.310
It hit the bullseye.

1219
00:47:30.344 --> 00:47:31.103
- It's fine. it's fine.
- It totally hit the bullseye.

1220
00:47:31.137 --> 00:47:32.103
And then it bounced off.

1221
00:47:32.137 --> 00:47:33.137
- Can I say something?

1222
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:35.448
I'm sorry.

1223
00:47:37.172 --> 00:47:38.068
- I beg your pardon.

1224
00:47:38.103 --> 00:47:40.137
- Don't tell nobody.

1225
00:47:40.172 --> 00:47:41.068
I couldn't hear you over
the slow.

1226
00:47:41.103 --> 00:47:42.206
What?

1227
00:47:42.241 --> 00:47:43.103
- I said. I'm sorry.

1228
00:47:44.551 --> 00:47:48.137
I was a little extra at dinner.

1229
00:47:48.172 --> 00:47:49.275
- A little bit.

1230
00:47:49.310 --> 00:47:50.241
- But you be on my neck though.

1231
00:47:50.275 --> 00:47:53.103
you be right here on my neck.

1232
00:47:53.137 --> 00:47:55.103
- Okay. I was a little forward.

1233
00:47:55.137 --> 00:47:56.068
- A little. a little?

1234
00:47:56.103 --> 00:47:57.965
- Ashamed.

1235
00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.413
- Walked out through the door.

1236
00:47:59.448 --> 00:48:01.137
as soon as we walked
through the door.

1237
00:48:01.172 --> 00:48:02.379
you were like. yo. what
you doing with your man?

1238
00:48:02.413 --> 00:48:04.275
What it is?
- You got your attitude.

1239
00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:07.172
Okay. like. you sometimes
just. you know. bring it out.

1240
00:48:08.310 --> 00:48:10.275
- Well. I'm sorry.

1241
00:48:10.310 --> 00:48:13.172
You just pushed my
buttons just a little bit.

1242
00:48:13.206 --> 00:48:14.482
but I shouldn't have
did that at dinner.

1243
00:48:14.517 --> 00:48:17.034
I'm sorry. I was out of line.

1244
00:48:17.068 --> 00:48:20.206
- You know the funny thing.
kind of pushed mine too.

1245
00:48:20.241 --> 00:48:21.965
So. call it even?

1246
00:48:25.482 --> 00:48:28.034
Now. that's out of
the way. watch this.

1247
00:48:30.137 --> 00:48:31.103
Trash.

1248
00:48:44.724 --> 00:48:47.137
- I say the blue.
definitely the blue.

1249
00:48:48.482 --> 00:48:49.310
- You think so?

1250
00:48:49.344 --> 00:48:51.103
- Mm-hmm.

1251
00:48:51.137 --> 00:48:52.068
- And you know
what else I think?

1252
00:48:52.103 --> 00:48:54.137
- What?

1253
00:48:54.172 --> 00:48:56.517
- I think that this would
go perfect with that.

1254
00:48:57.517 --> 00:48:58.586
- Wow.

1255
00:48:58.620 --> 00:48:59.448
You're right.

1256
00:48:59.482 --> 00:49:00.413
- Mh-hmm.

1257
00:49:01.551 --> 00:49:03.586
- I can wear this tomorrow?

1258
00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:06.413
- You can do more than
wear it. you can have it.

1259
00:49:06.448 --> 00:49:07.310
- Really?

1260
00:49:07.344 --> 00:49:08.172
- Yes. really.

1261
00:49:08.206 --> 00:49:09.068
- Thank you.

1262
00:49:12.586 --> 00:49:14.379
Now. hold on.

1263
00:49:14.413 --> 00:49:15.103
This isn't in the place
of my Christmas gift.

1264
00:49:15.137 --> 00:49:16.241
Is it?

1265
00:49:16.275 --> 00:49:17.413
- Oh girl. and if it was?

1266
00:49:17.448 --> 00:49:18.551
- You just playing. right?

1267
00:49:18.586 --> 00:49:21.000
- I don't know
baby. I don't know.

1268
00:49:22.517 --> 00:49:24.655
So. what's going on with you?

1269
00:49:24.689 --> 00:49:27.103
Something is
different about you.

1270
00:49:28.275 --> 00:49:29.620
- What do you mean?

1271
00:49:29.655 --> 00:49:31.275
- I know that look
from anywhere.

1272
00:49:31.310 --> 00:49:33.172
you more particular
about your clothes.

1273
00:49:33.206 --> 00:49:35.310
you sneaking off at all hours.

1274
00:49:35.344 --> 00:49:37.413
- Who told you that?

1275
00:49:37.448 --> 00:49:39.724
- Look. you can't slick
a can of all young lady.

1276
00:49:39.758 --> 00:49:42.241
Remember I used to
be your age once.

1277
00:49:42.275 --> 00:49:43.103
Now. who is he?

1278
00:49:44.275 --> 00:49:46.068
- Is it that obvious?

1279
00:49:46.103 --> 00:49:49.068
- Yes. actually it
is now dish. tell me.

1280
00:49:49.103 --> 00:49:50.482
- Okay. okay.

1281
00:49:50.517 --> 00:49:53.241
My boyfriend. his name is Brian.

1282
00:49:53.275 --> 00:49:56.241
- Oh. okay. Brian.

1283
00:49:56.275 --> 00:49:58.172
And how long you've
been seeing Brian?

1284
00:49:58.206 --> 00:49:59.586
- Long enough.

1285
00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:01.103
- Okay.

1286
00:50:01.137 --> 00:50:03.206
And how does Brian treat you?

1287
00:50:03.241 --> 00:50:05.241
- Like a princess.

1288
00:50:05.275 --> 00:50:07.551
- And do princesses sneak off
in the middle of the moon?

1289
00:50:07.586 --> 00:50:10.241
- I mean. hello.
Romeo and Juliet.

1290
00:50:10.275 --> 00:50:11.620
- And we see how
that turned out.

1291
00:50:13.551 --> 00:50:16.344
Look. my only advice to you

1292
00:50:16.379 --> 00:50:19.241
is just don't lose sight

1293
00:50:19.275 --> 00:50:22.689
of who your parents raised
you to be and you'll be okay.

1294
00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:25.310
- I like that. auntie.

1295
00:50:25.344 --> 00:50:26.206
I really do.

1296
00:50:27.241 --> 00:50:28.379
- Good.

1297
00:50:28.413 --> 00:50:31.275
Good. I'm pooped.

1298
00:50:31.310 --> 00:50:35.068
A hot shower and warm cups
as I call in my name. Lisa.

1299
00:50:38.482 --> 00:50:39.551
Now. don't stay up too
late now. all right?

1300
00:50:39.586 --> 00:50:40.482
- I won't.

1301
00:50:40.517 --> 00:50:42.344
- Good.

1302
00:50:42.379 --> 00:50:45.103
And another thing.
have y'all kissed?

1303
00:50:46.551 --> 00:50:48.448
- Ew. no. no

1304
00:50:48.482 --> 00:50:50.206
- Well. good. keep it that way.

1305
00:50:50.241 --> 00:50:51.103
- Really?

1306
00:50:53.103 --> 00:50:55.068
- Nah. it just sounded like
the right thing to say.

1307
00:50:55.103 --> 00:50:56.068
Good night. girlie.

1308
00:50:56.103 --> 00:50:56.655
- Good night.

1309
00:50:56.689 --> 00:50:57.586
- I love you.

1310
00:50:57.620 --> 00:50:59.068
- I love you too.

1311
00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:24.413
- What are you still doing up?

1312
00:51:24.448 --> 00:51:25.517
- Can't sleep.

1313
00:51:27.551 --> 00:51:30.275
Plus there's gifts that
still need wrapping soon.

1314
00:51:34.448 --> 00:51:35.620
Today was good. huh?

1315
00:51:37.137 --> 00:51:38.827
- Yeah.

1316
00:51:38.862 --> 00:51:41.275
You know. it went a lot
smoother than I thought.

1317
00:51:41.310 --> 00:51:43.413
I mean. we had a few
bumps along the way.

1318
00:51:43.448 --> 00:51:45.448
but it wasn't nothing major.

1319
00:51:46.310 --> 00:51:47.310
- Tim and Lisa.

1320
00:51:48.724 --> 00:51:50.275
- Yeah.
- What are we gonna do

1321
00:51:50.310 --> 00:51:51.448
with those two?

1322
00:51:53.448 --> 00:51:55.241
They've been at each other's
throats since they met.

1323
00:51:55.275 --> 00:51:57.172
If I didn't know any
better. I'd think...

1324
00:51:57.206 --> 00:51:57.724
- Uh-uh.

1325
00:51:57.758 --> 00:51:59.482
No. I can't.

1326
00:51:59.517 --> 00:52:01.413
I don't even want that
vision in my head.

1327
00:52:02.758 --> 00:52:03.655
Gross.

1328
00:52:05.241 --> 00:52:06.551
What about her situation though?

1329
00:52:08.275 --> 00:52:09.517
You think she's
gonna be all right.

1330
00:52:09.551 --> 00:52:11.379
- If I were a betting woman.

1331
00:52:11.413 --> 00:52:14.344
I'd say she'll figure
it out in her own time.

1332
00:52:16.413 --> 00:52:17.310
- No better than me.

1333
00:52:18.931 --> 00:52:22.241
So. how was the catching
up with your mom today?

1334
00:52:24.724 --> 00:52:25.896
- It's great. actually.

1335
00:52:27.586 --> 00:52:28.482
She's still applying
the pressure

1336
00:52:28.517 --> 00:52:30.482
for us to get married again.

1337
00:52:30.517 --> 00:52:31.310
That's crazy. right?

1338
00:52:32.586 --> 00:52:34.517
- What's so crazy about that?

1339
00:52:34.551 --> 00:52:36.551
- Dalton. come on.

1340
00:52:36.586 --> 00:52:37.758
- What do you mean. come on?

1341
00:52:40.586 --> 00:52:41.724
- We talked about this.

1342
00:52:42.724 --> 00:52:44.896
- No. we didn't.

1343
00:52:44.931 --> 00:52:48.655
If I recall. I asked
you to marry me again

1344
00:52:48.689 --> 00:52:50.482
and you turned me down.

1345
00:52:52.448 --> 00:52:54.241
That doesn't really sound much
like a discussion does it?

1346
00:52:54.275 --> 00:52:57.448
- That's not fair. I
just said not right now.

1347
00:52:57.482 --> 00:52:59.310
- Okay. then when?

1348
00:52:59.344 --> 00:53:01.413
- Dalton. can we not
do this right now?

1349
00:53:01.448 --> 00:53:02.241
- Do what?

1350
00:53:02.275 --> 00:53:02.965
- This.

1351
00:53:05.482 --> 00:53:06.724
- All right. what is it. Roz?

1352
00:53:07.758 --> 00:53:08.862
Are you scared of me?

1353
00:53:08.896 --> 00:53:11.896
Or are you scared of us?

1354
00:53:13.310 --> 00:53:13.793
What?

1355
00:53:15.586 --> 00:53:16.620
- It's everything.

1356
00:53:19.310 --> 00:53:21.275
Look. the first time I thought
we'd be together forever.

1357
00:53:21.310 --> 00:53:23.448
and look how that turned out.

1358
00:53:23.482 --> 00:53:24.793
Dalton. that was painful.

1359
00:53:26.517 --> 00:53:27.758
I don't wanna go
through that again.

1360
00:53:27.793 --> 00:53:29.896
- Hold on.

1361
00:53:29.931 --> 00:53:32.862
If I recall. you left me Roz.
you do remember that. right?

1362
00:53:32.896 --> 00:53:35.586
- Yeah. but you
didn't fight for me.

1363
00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:38.310
You just walked away.
like that's what you
wanted all along.

1364
00:53:38.344 --> 00:53:39.793
- No. it wasn't
like that. come on.

1365
00:53:41.517 --> 00:53:43.793
- Even if that's true.
which is debatable.

1366
00:53:43.827 --> 00:53:46.793
say we do get
married again. right?

1367
00:53:46.827 --> 00:53:49.551
And we get Esta's hopes
up. and my hopes up.

1368
00:53:49.586 --> 00:53:50.793
and you wake up one morning.

1369
00:53:50.827 --> 00:53:53.586
just resenting me and realizing

1370
00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:54.965
this isn't what
you really wanted.

1371
00:53:56.655 --> 00:53:58.689
- I mean. you're
pregnant with my son.

1372
00:53:58.724 --> 00:54:00.448
you're the mother of my child.

1373
00:54:01.827 --> 00:54:03.827
What about this.
could I not want?

1374
00:54:03.862 --> 00:54:06.862
- You act like we planned this.

1375
00:54:06.896 --> 00:54:09.379
This wasn't planned.
we're two people

1376
00:54:09.413 --> 00:54:11.448
who went too far one
night over some tequila

1377
00:54:11.482 --> 00:54:12.620
and here we are.

1378
00:54:12.655 --> 00:54:13.517
- Wow.

1379
00:54:14.862 --> 00:54:15.689
Really?

1380
00:54:18.758 --> 00:54:23.551
- Dalton. I didn't
mean it like that.

1381
00:54:30.896 --> 00:54:31.965
Just drop it. okay?

1382
00:54:49.034 --> 00:54:51.000
- For the last time
I'm with my family.

1383
00:54:51.034 --> 00:54:52.620
I'm not out here
partying and carrying on.

1384
00:54:52.655 --> 00:54:53.724
it's not that type of truth.

1385
00:54:55.758 --> 00:54:58.034
Look. if I didn't answer the
phone. it's because I'm busy.

1386
00:54:58.068 --> 00:54:59.827
All right. I'm not
your answer machine

1387
00:54:59.862 --> 00:55:01.896
that's available for you 24/7.

1388
00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:07.586
I not trying to get smart.

1389
00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:11.379
Like. I'm here now.
what do you need?

1390
00:55:13.758 --> 00:55:15.000
How much. Brandon?

1391
00:55:17.103 --> 00:55:18.793
Brandon. I just gave
you near that amount

1392
00:55:18.827 --> 00:55:20.448
a couple of weeks ago
and I never got it back.

1393
00:55:20.482 --> 00:55:22.000
Hell. what do I look
like ATM to you?

1394
00:55:23.034 --> 00:55:23.896
- No.

1395
00:55:26.482 --> 00:55:28.931
I get the crypto. maybe
the next best thing.

1396
00:55:28.965 --> 00:55:31.413
and I am all for
you investing in it

1397
00:55:31.448 --> 00:55:33.344
with your own damn money.

1398
00:55:35.931 --> 00:55:36.896
No. I didn't...

1399
00:55:36.931 --> 00:55:37.758
Brandon?

1400
00:55:38.965 --> 00:55:40.551
Hello?

1401
00:55:40.586 --> 00:55:41.413
Bran...

1402
00:55:42.896 --> 00:55:44.000
No. he didn't.

1403
00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:42.034
Ooh. you got it?

1404
00:57:42.068 --> 00:57:46.862
- Yeah.

1405
00:57:48.758 --> 00:57:50.896
Girl. Esta did her
job on these cookies.

1406
00:57:50.931 --> 00:57:52.724
I don't even know what this is.

1407
00:57:52.758 --> 00:57:54.206
Is it Macadamian nuts and
chocolate chips or what is that?

1408
00:57:54.241 --> 00:57:55.862
I love it when she put
those chunks in it.

1409
00:57:55.896 --> 00:57:57.241
those chunks and girl last

1410
00:57:57.275 --> 00:57:58.931
she's gotten so much
better than last year.

1411
00:57:58.965 --> 00:58:01.068
'Cause last year. girl.
the chips were so hard.

1412
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.068
Are you okay?

1413
00:58:09.344 --> 00:58:10.862
- Me?

1414
00:58:10.896 --> 00:58:12.172
- Yeah.

1415
00:58:12.206 --> 00:58:13.068
- Yeah. why?

1416
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.793
- Oh no. you just seem.
you just seem different.

1417
00:58:21.758 --> 00:58:23.034
- Are we making a mistake?

1418
00:58:24.827 --> 00:58:26.241
- You picked a fine time
to ask that question.

1419
00:58:26.275 --> 00:58:30.620
when the baby about
to pop out.

1420
00:58:30.655 --> 00:58:32.310
Look. I'm sorry.

1421
00:58:32.344 --> 00:58:35.896
I just don't understand What
scares you so much about this?

1422
00:58:37.793 --> 00:58:38.827
- You wouldn't understand.

1423
00:58:40.103 --> 00:58:42.068
- Oh. because I'm not married.

1424
00:58:42.103 --> 00:58:44.241
I don't have any common sense.

1425
00:58:44.275 --> 00:58:46.620
Girl. a blind man can see
that Dalton is a good man.

1426
00:58:46.655 --> 00:58:48.655
You know. do you need
your vision checked?

1427
00:58:48.689 --> 00:58:50.827
- No. Lisa. I didn't
mean it like that.

1428
00:58:50.862 --> 00:58:54.034
I know Dalton is a good man. I
don't need my vision checked.

1429
00:58:54.068 --> 00:58:55.793
He just feels...

1430
00:58:55.827 --> 00:58:56.551
- What. it feels
too good to be true?

1431
00:58:56.586 --> 00:58:57.896
- Yes.

1432
00:58:57.931 --> 00:58:59.793
- You left him. remember?

1433
00:58:59.827 --> 00:59:00.655
Hell. he never would've left.
if you hadn't pushed him away.

1434
00:59:01.793 --> 00:59:02.655
Not you too.

1435
00:59:05.068 --> 00:59:07.172
You are lucky to have a
man that cares about you.

1436
00:59:11.103 --> 00:59:13.310
Not everybody has that.

1437
00:59:16.103 --> 00:59:17.172
- You wouldn't-

1438
00:59:17.206 --> 00:59:18.275
- Girl. don't mention his name.

1439
00:59:22.172 --> 00:59:23.827
- Why do you put
up with that. Lisa?

1440
00:59:28.206 --> 00:59:30.689
- I guess the same reason
that Dalton could tell you.

1441
00:59:33.034 --> 00:59:35.172
- The same reason
daddy put up with mama?

1442
00:59:37.758 --> 00:59:38.206
- Exactly.

1443
00:59:40.034 --> 00:59:41.620
Girl. love makes you
do some crazy things.

1444
00:59:43.724 --> 00:59:45.724
Let's get these
cookies up in here.

1445
00:59:45.758 --> 00:59:47.137
Dry your eyes.

1446
00:59:47.172 --> 00:59:48.689
Okay. we're gonna be
going up in this church.

1447
00:59:48.724 --> 00:59:51.827
You cry in the
street. mascara down.

1448
00:59:55.724 --> 00:59:57.344
- Look. on snap gram.

1449
00:59:57.379 --> 00:59:59.137
you just choose whichever
one. you know what I'm saying?

1450
00:59:59.172 --> 01:00:00.000
- Look up.

1451
01:00:01.862 --> 01:00:02.862
- Hey. look at mama
has got her present.

1452
01:00:02.896 --> 01:00:04.275
You can tell this game.

1453
01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:06.724
you can tell they got
his name all over.

1454
01:00:06.758 --> 01:00:08.137
- You see what I'm saying?

1455
01:00:08.172 --> 01:00:09.724
That's why we stopped
doing secret Santa

1456
01:00:09.758 --> 01:00:11.172
because of his cheating.
but do you see that-

1457
01:00:11.206 --> 01:00:13.137
- Hey. look. that
is a piece of art.

1458
01:00:13.172 --> 01:00:15.689
and it's sad that you came
all the way here for that.

1459
01:00:15.724 --> 01:00:17.965
Anyway. it's Christmas.
so can we just move on?

1460
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:18.862
Leave me alone.

1461
01:00:20.068 --> 01:00:21.000
- Show me snap the gram.

1462
01:00:21.034 --> 01:00:22.793
- Oh. look here. hold on.

1463
01:00:22.827 --> 01:00:23.275
- Hey dad.

1464
01:00:27.827 --> 01:00:29.896
- Hey baby.

1465
01:00:29.931 --> 01:00:32.965
- So. I wrote my essay on
why I wanted to play golf.

1466
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.344
- Your essay. right?

1467
01:00:35.379 --> 01:00:38.965
Let us hear it. go
ahead. give us a summary.

1468
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.241
- Dad. just a summary?

1469
01:00:40.275 --> 01:00:42.172
I wrote this whole thing.

1470
01:00:42.206 --> 01:00:44.172
- Baby. I just wanted
you to write it

1471
01:00:44.206 --> 01:00:46.724
so you would see it
through. you know.

1472
01:00:46.758 --> 01:00:50.000
Remember that work ethic thing
I told you about. all right?

1473
01:00:50.034 --> 01:00:51.827
But we listening. lay it on us.

1474
01:00:51.862 --> 01:00:53.689
Yeah.

1475
01:00:53.724 --> 01:00:56.103
- Okay. so. when my
friends let me tag

1476
01:00:56.137 --> 01:00:58.310
on the course for a scrabble.

1477
01:00:58.344 --> 01:01:00.103
I was amazed the
amount of people I met

1478
01:01:00.137 --> 01:01:02.068
and bonded with over the way.

1479
01:01:02.103 --> 01:01:03.931
I met a member of the commerce.

1480
01:01:03.965 --> 01:01:05.137
an executive from
the top company

1481
01:01:05.172 --> 01:01:06.965
that offered and
gave me a letter

1482
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.034
of reference if
I ever needed it.

1483
01:01:08.068 --> 01:01:08.896
- Really?

1484
01:01:08.931 --> 01:01:10.000
- I'm there.

1485
01:01:10.034 --> 01:01:11.793
- Okay.

1486
01:01:11.827 --> 01:01:15.034
- And so. that's it.
that's my reason.

1487
01:01:15.068 --> 01:01:17.068
Golf is where the
deals are made. Dad.

1488
01:01:17.103 --> 01:01:20.310
You hear that?

1489
01:01:20.344 --> 01:01:22.172
- Yeah. wow.

1490
01:01:22.206 --> 01:01:23.896
- My little baby. a
boss in the making.

1491
01:01:23.931 --> 01:01:25.448
- I sure am.

1492
01:01:25.482 --> 01:01:29.413
And not to mention
it's literally so fun.

1493
01:01:29.448 --> 01:01:32.103
and it gives me access
to people I wouldn't.

1494
01:01:32.137 --> 01:01:35.896
haven't already able to reach.
not to mention it's fun.

1495
01:01:35.931 --> 01:01:37.931
Dad. I really wanna do it.

1496
01:01:37.965 --> 01:01:39.206
- Yeah. I do.

1497
01:01:39.241 --> 01:01:41.034
Okay. look at me.

1498
01:01:41.068 --> 01:01:42.379
Tell me about your
favorite player.

1499
01:01:43.931 --> 01:01:45.344
- Clemmie Perry.

1500
01:01:45.379 --> 01:01:47.241
she literally started
playing it as a hobby

1501
01:01:47.275 --> 01:01:50.034
and then noticed the entire
sport can use some diversity.

1502
01:01:50.068 --> 01:01:53.793
She bridged a lot of gaps
dad. for girls like me.

1503
01:01:53.827 --> 01:01:55.068
- Girls like you.

1504
01:01:55.103 --> 01:01:56.310
How about that?

1505
01:01:56.344 --> 01:01:58.931
- I don't know.
still on the fence

1506
01:01:58.965 --> 01:02:02.379
about that golf thing. man.

1507
01:02:02.413 --> 01:02:03.448
We'll think about it.

1508
01:02:05.310 --> 01:02:06.965
Pass me that gift.

1509
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.344
Here. I forgot to give you this.

1510
01:02:10.103 --> 01:02:11.827
I had to take your mind
off that golf stuff.

1511
01:02:13.103 --> 01:02:14.068
- Can I open it?

1512
01:02:14.103 --> 01:02:14.931
- Yeah. open it now.

1513
01:02:42.068 --> 01:02:43.379
- Does this mean...

1514
01:02:43.413 --> 01:02:45.379
- Uh-huh.

1515
01:02:45.413 --> 01:02:48.000
You're gonna be the
best golfer ever.

1516
01:02:48.034 --> 01:02:49.413
- Thank you dad.

1517
01:02:49.448 --> 01:02:51.068
And you know. I will.
'cause I'm McKenzie.

1518
01:02:51.103 --> 01:02:52.827
- Hey. that's what
I'm talking about.

1519
01:02:52.862 --> 01:02:54.000
just like your uncle Tim. right?

1520
01:02:55.172 --> 01:02:56.000
- Put that McKenzie stink on it.

1521
01:02:56.034 --> 01:02:57.827
- I sure will.

1522
01:02:57.862 --> 01:03:01.034
- Yeah. a little tiger.
a little. lady tiger.

1523
01:03:01.068 --> 01:03:02.034
- That's right.

1524
01:03:02.068 --> 01:03:03.137
- Lady Tiger Woods.

1525
01:03:04.344 --> 01:03:05.517
That's my girl.

1526
01:03:09.034 --> 01:03:10.172
- Who is that?

1527
01:03:10.206 --> 01:03:12.068
- I'll get it.

1528
01:03:12.103 --> 01:03:14.034
- Boy. did you invite

1529
01:03:14.068 --> 01:03:15.310
one of your little snap
the gram girls over here?

1530
01:03:16.379 --> 01:03:18.206
- This the snap gram bro.

1531
01:03:18.241 --> 01:03:19.344
- Pete. get on this.

1532
01:03:19.379 --> 01:03:21.482
- Yo. snap the gram.

1533
01:03:21.517 --> 01:03:23.931
- I'm trying to tell you.
they think it's done for.

1534
01:03:23.965 --> 01:03:25.379
Uh. extra cake.

1535
01:03:25.413 --> 01:03:27.000
Hey. everybody.

1536
01:03:29.241 --> 01:03:32.034
This is Brian. my boyfriend.

What did you say. boyfriend?

1540
01:03:36.344 --> 01:03:37.448

You. you are the boyfriend?

1543
01:03:42.896 --> 01:03:46.586
- Talking about your boyfriend.
I'll be judge of that.

1544
01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:48.551
- Esta. I think I forgot
some gifts upstairs.

1545
01:03:48.586 --> 01:03:51.034
Why don't we go
upstairs and get them.

1546
01:03:51.068 --> 01:03:51.517
- Yes. ma'am.

1547

No.

1553
01:04:03.275 --> 01:04:04.068
- Oh. you know what to say.

1554
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.068
- I bust you homie.
I'll roll up on you.

1555
01:04:12.310 --> 01:04:14.034

1556
01:04:14.068 --> 01:04:14.931

1557
01:04:14.965 --> 01:04:16.241

1558
01:04:16.275 --> 01:04:17.241
- Well. what you gonna do?

- Say. you're sorry sir.

1560

Increase the pace of your voice.

- I'm sorry. sir.

1562
01:04:21.275 --> 01:04:22.965
I'm sorry!

Man. welcome

1564
01:04:37.103 --> 01:04:42.103
- So. Mr. Brian.

1565
01:04:43.413 --> 01:04:44.517
Your name has been popping up

1566
01:04:44.551 --> 01:04:46.241
a whole lot around here lately.

1567
01:04:46.275 --> 01:04:48.310
- Yeah.

1568
01:04:48.344 --> 01:04:49.517
- Good thing to finally
put a face with that name.

1569
01:04:49.551 --> 01:04:51.000
- Yeah.

1570
01:04:51.034 --> 01:04:51.965
Where you from. son?

1571
01:04:53.517 --> 01:04:55.241
- Originally from
North Carolina. sir.

1572
01:04:55.275 --> 01:04:58.000
But my family moved
here few years back.

1573
01:04:58.034 --> 01:05:00.103
- Now. you a only child?

1574
01:05:00.137 --> 01:05:03.413
- No. sir. I have
two older brothers.

1575
01:05:03.448 --> 01:05:05.517
- Let me ask you this then.

1576
01:05:05.551 --> 01:05:08.275
Why are you hanging out with
my niece instead of them?

1577
01:05:08.310 --> 01:05:09.482
- Right?

1578
01:05:09.517 --> 01:05:11.482
- Excuse me. sir?

1579
01:05:11.517 --> 01:05:13.275
- It's a question.

1580
01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:14.379
- He's just messing
with you. man.

1581
01:05:14.413 --> 01:05:16.034
- I ain't messing with him.

1582
01:05:16.068 --> 01:05:17.448
It's a fair question.
- Answer the question.

1583
01:05:17.482 --> 01:05:19.137
- Look. man. the
question is this bro.

1584
01:05:19.172 --> 01:05:21.034
- How'd you meet my niece?

1585
01:05:21.068 --> 01:05:22.344
Where was it though. y'all
are one in class together?

1586
01:05:22.379 --> 01:05:23.241
- Yeah.

1587
01:05:23.275 --> 01:05:24.241
- And so what?

1588
01:05:24.275 --> 01:05:26.344
- Something like that.

1589
01:05:26.379 --> 01:05:28.344
I met her at school. she was
studying and doing pep rally.

1590
01:05:28.379 --> 01:05:29.344
She was looking good.

1591
01:05:29.379 --> 01:05:31.206
So. I don't know.

1592
01:05:31.241 --> 01:05:33.034
- Hey. watch your mouth.
you little thunder cat.

1593
01:05:33.068 --> 01:05:34.103
- Respectfully. sir.

1594
01:05:36.206 --> 01:05:39.172
- So. you play sports
or something. in
your little school.

1595
01:05:40.172 --> 01:05:42.103
- Football. safety.

1596
01:05:42.137 --> 01:05:43.344
- Oh. well.

1597
01:05:43.379 --> 01:05:44.482
- Look. football.

1598
01:05:44.517 --> 01:05:46.275
- He is safe.

1599
01:05:46.310 --> 01:05:47.482
- He want safety.

1600
01:05:47.517 --> 01:05:48.344
don't come across
the middle play.

1601
01:05:48.379 --> 01:05:49.482
- This boy.

1602
01:05:49.517 --> 01:05:50.241
- Well look. are you any good?

1603
01:05:50.275 --> 01:05:51.344
Huh?

1604
01:05:51.379 --> 01:05:53.172
You take football serious?

1605
01:05:53.206 --> 01:05:54.655
That's what you
wanna do. long term?

1606
01:05:54.689 --> 01:05:57.310
- Not really. it's
more of a pastime.

1607
01:05:57.344 --> 01:05:58.724
I actually enjoy tech.

1608
01:05:58.758 --> 01:06:01.241
and I plan on majoring
in the stem program.

1609
01:06:01.275 --> 01:06:03.172

Big money.

A tech man.

1616
01:06:09.586 --> 01:06:10.551
- Well. aren't we impressed.

To attend full scholarship.

1627
01:06:30.586 --> 01:06:31.551

01:06:31.586 --> 01:06:32.551

- Hold on. son.

1636

Don't you know my baby
is barely 16-years-old.

01:06:51.448 --> 01:06:53.344
and you damn near a grown man

1638
01:06:53.379 --> 01:06:55.068
and you don't come up at
my house disrespecting me

1639
01:06:55.103 --> 01:06:57.275
talking about you
a boyfriend. huh?

1640
01:06:57.310 --> 01:06:59.586
- I know the optics look bad.

1641
01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:01.379
but technically we're
only a year apart.

1642
01:07:01.413 --> 01:07:03.172
- You better explain it.

1643
01:07:03.206 --> 01:07:04.655
'cause we finna put
these paws on you son.

1644
01:07:04.689 --> 01:07:06.448
- So. when I was in
elementary school.

1645
01:07:06.482 --> 01:07:07.620
they thought I was too advanced.

1646
01:07:07.655 --> 01:07:09.448
So they put me in AP classes.

1647
01:07:09.482 --> 01:07:10.862
I swear on everything.

1648
01:07:10.896 --> 01:07:11.758
- Mh.

1649
01:07:13.793 --> 01:07:16.172
- So. why are you messing
with my daughter. Brian?

1650
01:07:16.206 --> 01:07:18.448
Why don't you get somebody
in your own grade. huh?

1651
01:07:19.655 --> 01:07:23.137
- I mean. why not her?

1652
01:07:23.172 --> 01:07:24.275
- Wow.

1653
01:07:24.310 --> 01:07:25.275
- Are you trying me. man?

1654
01:07:25.310 --> 01:07:26.275
- Wow.
- Huh?

1655
01:07:26.310 --> 01:07:27.310
- No. sir.

1656
01:07:27.344 --> 01:07:28.482
Respectfully.

1657
01:07:28.517 --> 01:07:29.655
That's just no ordinary girl.

1658
01:07:29.689 --> 01:07:32.103
She's smart. she's kind.

1659
01:07:33.689 --> 01:07:35.482
She's adventurous
and she's real.

1660
01:07:37.275 --> 01:07:39.241
She doesn't try to be
anyone else but herself.

1661
01:07:39.275 --> 01:07:42.379
and that's somebody I wanna
take home to my family.

1662
01:07:42.413 --> 01:07:43.275
- Hm.

1663
01:07:48.310 --> 01:07:49.724
Yeah. okay.

1664
01:07:49.758 --> 01:07:51.275
Man. I
kind of feel that.

1665
01:07:51.310 --> 01:07:53.275
- I guess you are smart.

1666
01:07:53.310 --> 01:07:55.137
Yeah.

1667
01:07:55.172 --> 01:07:57.137
- And if it's all right
with you. or with you all.

1668
01:07:57.172 --> 01:08:00.586
I would like to get
your permission there.

1669
01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:05.379
- I will approve of it for
now. but I'm watching you son.

1670
01:08:06.551 --> 01:08:07.517
We all are.

1671
01:08:07.551 --> 01:08:08.517
- Yeah.

1672
01:08:08.551 --> 01:08:09.517
- For sure. all right?

1673
01:08:09.551 --> 01:08:10.344
- Yes. sir.

1674
01:08:10.379 --> 01:08:11.241
- Yes. sir.

1675
01:08:15.689 --> 01:08:18.758
- Dad. what's going on here?

1676
01:08:18.793 --> 01:08:21.655
Just getting acquainted with
your little boyfriend here.

1677
01:08:21.689 --> 01:08:22.655
- Bonding.

1678
01:08:22.689 --> 01:08:23.793
- Big time.

1679
01:08:23.827 --> 01:08:24.724
- Sure about that?

1680
01:08:26.517 --> 01:08:27.793
- What in the world
is going on here?

1681
01:08:27.827 --> 01:08:29.655
- That's what I'd like to know.

1682
01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:31.482
- And who is this?

1683
01:08:31.517 --> 01:08:33.206
- Mh. I know who this is.

1684
01:08:33.241 --> 01:08:35.344
- I'm gonna let your
daughter explain who this is.

1685
01:08:36.344 --> 01:08:37.206
- Ma'am.

1686
01:08:38.413 --> 01:08:40.206
- Well. mom. I just.

1687
01:08:41.689 --> 01:08:42.827
- Let's get outta here.

1688
01:08:44.586 --> 01:08:47.689
- I was wondering if we
could talk for a second.

1689
01:08:47.724 --> 01:08:49.931
- Oh. no. not right now.

1690
01:08:49.965 --> 01:08:51.310
Perfect.

1691
01:08:51.344 --> 01:08:52.344
Yeah.

1692
01:08:52.379 --> 01:08:53.724
- I can help you.

1693
01:08:55.793 --> 01:08:58.482
- Hey. hey. hey. can I talk
to you for a minute outside?

1694
01:08:58.517 --> 01:08:59.689
- You got one minute.

1695
01:08:59.724 --> 01:09:00.724
- That's what I
said. one minute.

1696
01:09:00.758 --> 01:09:02.275
- One.

1697
01:09:02.310 --> 01:09:03.413
- Okay. I'll take that.
- Trust.

1698
01:09:03.448 --> 01:09:04.344
- Okay. it's fine.

1699
01:09:04.379 --> 01:09:05.413
All right.

1700
01:09:05.448 --> 01:09:06.448
- What's up man?

1701
01:09:06.482 --> 01:09:08.413
You like to hit?

1702
01:09:08.448 --> 01:09:09.793
I mean I hope you
can take a hit.

1703
01:09:11.482 --> 01:09:13.931
Hey. gonna feel the
power of the Pete. boy.

01:09:15.413 --> 01:09:16.793
What's my name?

1705
01:09:16.827 --> 01:09:17.586
Stand up when I'm
talking to you. man.

1706
01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:18.758
Look me in the eye.

1707
01:09:18.793 --> 01:09:19.758
Why would you salute. man.

1708
01:09:19.793 --> 01:09:20.758
We ain't in the army.

1709
01:09:20.793 --> 01:09:21.758
The hell are you doing?

1710
01:09:21.793 --> 01:09:23.413
What's my name. man.

1711
01:09:23.448 --> 01:09:24.827
Uncle Pete. uncle Pete.

1712
01:09:24.862 --> 01:09:27.379
- Put some bass in your
voice. talk like Mike.

1713
01:09:27.413 --> 01:09:27.896
- Uncle Pete.

1714
01:09:30.827 --> 01:09:32.448
- So. you brought me out
here. what do you want?

1715
01:09:32.482 --> 01:09:33.896
- Wow. I see you're

1716
01:09:33.931 --> 01:09:35.448
- Look. I can leave-
- No. no. no. no.

1717
01:09:35.482 --> 01:09:38.482
Look. I'm sorry. I
really do come in peace.

1718
01:09:38.517 --> 01:09:40.827
- You just can't help
yourself. can you?

1719
01:09:40.862 --> 01:09:42.620
- Oh no. I can't. because
you make it so easy.

1720
01:09:42.655 --> 01:09:43.862
- Look. I got your easy.

1721
01:09:43.896 --> 01:09:45.620
what do you want.
it's cold out here.

1722
01:09:45.655 --> 01:09:46.758
- I noticed you're
not your normal self.

1723
01:09:46.793 --> 01:09:48.793
and I don't wanna overstep.

1724
01:09:48.827 --> 01:09:51.965
- Which is exactly what people
say right before they do.

1725
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.827
- I overheard your
phone call last night.

1726
01:09:54.862 --> 01:09:57.275
Lisa. why do you fool
with that dude. come on.

1727
01:09:57.310 --> 01:10:01.379
Look. you are too smart
and too good of a woman

1728
01:10:01.413 --> 01:10:03.241
to allow any man to
talk to you that way.

1729
01:10:05.827 --> 01:10:07.655
- Oh. you mean the
way you talk to me?

1730
01:10:09.413 --> 01:10:10.379
That's okay though. right?

1731
01:10:10.413 --> 01:10:10.965
Because we're family.

1732
01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.379
I gotta accept anything you
give. nobody else. right?

1733
01:10:19.413 --> 01:10:20.620
- I'm sorry.

1734
01:10:20.655 --> 01:10:22.275
Look. I'll be the first to admit

1735
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:23.413
I'm a little hard
on you sometimes.

1736
01:10:23.448 --> 01:10:24.827
- A little.

1737
01:10:24.862 --> 01:10:26.793
- But I see so much
potential in you.

1738
01:10:26.827 --> 01:10:29.758
and you're not gonna reach
it fooling with that dude.

1739
01:10:29.793 --> 01:10:31.310
Look. he's not worth your time.

1740
01:10:31.344 --> 01:10:33.689
and I think you
deserve much better.

1741
01:10:35.965 --> 01:10:37.482
- Look. I know. it's just
crazy how you can lose yourself

1742
01:10:42.413 --> 01:10:46.448
in someone to the point where
you just trick your mind

1743
01:10:46.482 --> 01:10:50.275
into thinking you can do
better or survive without him.

1744
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.896
- Lisa. you are a beautiful.
intelligent. stubborn.

1745
01:10:58.862 --> 01:11:02.689
anD ambitious woman and any
man would be lucky to have you.

1746
01:11:04.724 --> 01:11:06.344
If I wasn't your
brother brother-in-law.

1747
01:11:06.379 --> 01:11:07.793
- But you are. so. get
that outta your mind.

1748
01:11:07.827 --> 01:11:09.448
- Of course. that's
what I'm saying.

1749
01:11:09.482 --> 01:11:12.620
but just imagine all of
the other men out there

1750
01:11:12.655 --> 01:11:14.862
who are just waiting in their
lives for a shot with you.

1751
01:11:17.551 --> 01:11:18.965
It's gonna happen in time.

1752
01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.448
but not until you
handle your business.

1753
01:11:22.827 --> 01:11:25.344
You know what you
gotta do. right?

1754
01:11:25.379 --> 01:11:26.379
- Yeah. I know.

1755
01:11:27.965 --> 01:11:28.793
Thank you.

1756
01:11:30.379 --> 01:11:32.000
Really. thank you.

1757
01:11:32.034 --> 01:11:33.689
I have you
back. you know that. right?

1758
01:11:33.724 --> 01:11:35.517
- Yeah. whatever.

1759
01:11:36.551 --> 01:11:39.344
- Okay. no. it's cool.

1760
01:11:39.379 --> 01:11:40.862
Let's go. can we
go inside please?

1761
01:11:40.896 --> 01:11:42.793
- You're gonna stop
telling me what to do.

1762
01:11:42.827 --> 01:11:45.517
- When you loose. I'll be
your problem. come on now.

1763
01:11:51.551 --> 01:11:52.448
- Thank you.

1764
01:11:52.482 --> 01:11:53.344
- No problem.

1765
01:12:00.965 --> 01:12:02.896
- So you did it.
you survived my dad.

1766
01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:05.724
- And your uncles.

1767
01:12:05.758 --> 01:12:07.517
- Oh yeah. them too.

1768
01:12:08.655 --> 01:12:10.551
I should have warned you.

1769
01:12:10.586 --> 01:12:12.586
- Yeah. you let me into the
lion's den then with that one.

1770
01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:14.517
But I enjoyed it.

1771
01:12:14.551 --> 01:12:15.000
- You did?

1772
01:12:15.034 --> 01:12:16.827
- No.

1773
01:12:16.862 --> 01:12:18.517
- See. I knew it.

1774
01:12:20.034 --> 01:12:21.379
- It was intense though.

1775
01:12:22.965 --> 01:12:24.448
I haven't felt that much
trust since the SATs.

1776
01:12:26.448 --> 01:12:28.724
But I get it. they're
just looking out for you.

1777
01:12:29.965 --> 01:12:32.413
Question is. did
I pass the test?

1778
01:12:34.448 --> 01:12:35.586
- Well. I mean. you're still
walking on both your legs.

1779
01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:36.931
so. I'd say yeah. you did.

1780
01:12:36.965 --> 01:12:37.931
- Yeah.

1781
01:12:37.965 --> 01:12:38.793
I guess you're right.

1782
01:12:40.896 --> 01:12:42.000
I'm hungry. let's go back
inside and get something.

1783
01:12:42.034 --> 01:12:44.448
- Me too. I'm starving.

1784
01:12:44.482 --> 01:12:46.724
And my grandma's
apple pie is no joke.

1785
01:12:46.758 --> 01:12:47.758
- For real?

1786
01:12:47.793 --> 01:12:48.655
- For real. for real.

1787
01:12:55.965 --> 01:13:00.482
Look. so then he
says. he wants to be in tech.

1788
01:13:01.793 --> 01:13:03.137
Yep. that's good.

1789
01:13:03.172 --> 01:13:04.862
What's
wrong with tech Tim.

1790
01:13:04.896 --> 01:13:05.793
what's wrong with being in tech.

1791
01:13:05.827 --> 01:13:07.931
- What's wrong with that. Pete?

1792
01:13:07.965 --> 01:13:10.655
Look. I looked up his stats.
I mean. he's pretty good.

1793
01:13:10.689 --> 01:13:12.482
I think with a little
bit of development.

1794
01:13:12.517 --> 01:13:14.793
he could make the league.

1795
01:13:14.827 --> 01:13:16.827
- That's the thing though.

1796
01:13:16.862 --> 01:13:18.862
Black men don't have to
aspire to play a sport

1797
01:13:18.896 --> 01:13:19.827
just because they're good at it.

1798
01:13:19.862 --> 01:13:21.517
- Oh. he's right.

1799
01:13:21.551 --> 01:13:23.000
- It's like people telling you.

1800
01:13:23.034 --> 01:13:24.862
do you play basketball
because you're tall?

1801
01:13:24.896 --> 01:13:26.827
- And he's not tall at all.

1802
01:13:26.862 --> 01:13:28.551
- I'm just saying. the height.

1803
01:13:30.655 --> 01:13:32.000
- It's not about me in this
moment. I'm just saying.

1804
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.793
- Tim. come on.

1805
01:13:34.827 --> 01:13:35.965
- Listen. Tim you're
so damn political.

1806
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:36.965
- I'm tired of ball.
- In that case.

1807
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.482
I can't stand you bro.

1808
01:13:38.517 --> 01:13:40.137
- Yep. Brian. man.

1809
01:13:40.172 --> 01:13:41.827
Look. don't. don't worry
about that one there. okay?

1810
01:13:41.862 --> 01:13:43.793
- You'll never win one
with that. that's real.

1811
01:13:45.793 --> 01:13:46.448
- So. miss Marie.

1812
01:13:47.206 --> 01:13:49.000
- Yes.

1813
01:13:49.034 --> 01:13:50.965
- I cannot wait to
taste your apple pie.

1814
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.758
- The wait is over.

1815
01:13:52.793 --> 01:13:55.586
- That's why I love
me some of this.

1816
01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:56.965
- Hey. Pete.

1817
01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:57.620
But you'd like
anybody to feed you.

1818
01:13:57.655 --> 01:13:59.137
- That's true.

1819
01:13:59.172 --> 01:14:01.034
- That's true. that's
very. very true.

1820
01:14:03.586 --> 01:14:05.827
- Look. you gotta defend
yourself now. player.

1821
01:14:05.862 --> 01:14:06.689
- Yeah.

1822
01:14:06.724 --> 01:14:07.551
- Crazy dude.

1823
01:14:09.724 --> 01:14:13.034
Serious
moment real quick guys.

1824
01:14:15.862 --> 01:14:16.724
I wanna make a toast.

1825
01:14:17.724 --> 01:14:19.827
- All right.

1826
01:14:19.862 --> 01:14:21.724
- Because we almost didn't
come together this week.

1827
01:14:21.758 --> 01:14:23.586
- Um. because of who I wanted.

1828
01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:27.206
All right.
that's on me. that's my bad.

1829
01:14:27.241 --> 01:14:30.896
But honestly. I'm glad
that all of you made it.

1830
01:14:32.965 --> 01:14:35.551
because I love you.
you're my family.

1831
01:14:35.586 --> 01:14:36.724
and we're nothing
without family.

1832
01:14:36.758 --> 01:14:38.758
we're nothing without love.

1833
01:14:38.793 --> 01:14:42.137
So. raise your
glasses and let's pray

1834
01:14:42.172 --> 01:14:45.034
that we never have to wait
this long to be together again.

1835
01:14:45.068 --> 01:14:46.758
All right. family.

1836
01:14:47.724 --> 01:14:48.551
- Family.

1837
01:14:49.586 --> 01:14:50.827
- My man.

1838
01:14:50.862 --> 01:14:52.655
- Church call.

1839
01:14:52.689 --> 01:14:53.724
Mh-hmm.

1840
01:14:53.758 --> 01:14:55.172
- I love y'all. man.

1841
01:14:55.206 --> 01:14:56.103
Oh. it's all
back to you brother.

1842
01:14:56.137 --> 01:14:59.034
- Since we're all here together.

1843
01:14:59.068 --> 01:15:02.758
I would like to say family
is love and I love you guys.

1844
01:15:02.793 --> 01:15:06.034
but you never apologize
cracking my tooth last year.

1845
01:15:06.068 --> 01:15:09.000
Oh. come on man. you
are still talking about that.

1846
01:15:09.034 --> 01:15:09.793
- Whoa. who. whoa. I already
told you that we're not.

1847
01:15:09.827 --> 01:15:11.620
it was the oven. bro.

1848
01:15:11.655 --> 01:15:13.034
- Why did you change
your name to oven?

1849
01:15:13.068 --> 01:15:14.793
- Ooh!

1850
01:15:14.827 --> 01:15:15.965
- Really. really?

1851
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:16.862
Jams?

1852
01:15:16.896 --> 01:15:18.724
Ask her.

1853
01:15:18.758 --> 01:15:19.724
- You're not gonna come
to your dad's for this?

1854
01:15:19.758 --> 01:15:20.827
Right. right.

1855
01:15:20.862 --> 01:15:21.586
- Those cookies were hard.

1856
01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:22.620
- Oh. wow.

1857
01:15:23.827 --> 01:15:24.620
- That's why we needed a break.

1858
01:15:24.655 --> 01:15:25.172
- Oh. God.

1859
01:15:25.206 --> 01:15:25.965
God. oh. wow.

1860
01:15:27.931 --> 01:15:28.758
You understand?

1861
01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:31.241
Exactly.

1862
01:15:31.275 --> 01:15:32.965
- No. no. no. I think
my water just broke.

1863
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:33.931
You could still stay.

1864
01:15:33.965 --> 01:15:35.655
- What?

1865
01:15:35.689 --> 01:15:37.068
- But ma'am. you
water is right there.

1866
01:15:37.103 --> 01:15:38.068
- No. young man.

1867
01:15:38.103 --> 01:15:39.103
My water just broke.

1868
01:15:40.655 --> 01:15:41.793
- Oh.

1869
01:15:41.827 --> 01:15:43.862
- Damn.

1870
01:15:43.896 --> 01:15:45.655
- We got a baby.

1871
01:15:45.689 --> 01:15:46.206
- Whoa. whoa. whoa. what
do you want me to do?

1872
01:15:46.241 --> 01:15:47.034
Call an Uber?

1873
01:15:48.827 --> 01:15:49.724
- No. no. it's
too early now. no.

1874
01:15:49.758 --> 01:15:51.620
- Call an Uber.

1875
01:16:17.068 --> 01:16:18.137
- How is she?

1876
01:16:19.758 --> 01:16:20.793
- She did good.

1877
01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.034
And you did great.

1878
01:16:24.068 --> 01:16:26.310
Oh my God.

1879
01:16:26.344 --> 01:16:28.965
I'm just so glad that
you decided to come.

1880
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:29.689
- If you're glad?

1881
01:16:29.724 --> 01:16:30.620
I'm glad.

1882
01:16:32.206 --> 01:16:34.689
Look. I just took
her vitals. okay?

1883
01:16:34.724 --> 01:16:35.689
They're good.

1884
01:16:35.724 --> 01:16:37.344
- Okay.

1885
01:16:37.379 --> 01:16:39.310
- Just get off the phone with
her doctor and guess what?

1886
01:16:39.344 --> 01:16:41.241
She'll be here first thing in
the morning for a house visit.

1887
01:16:41.275 --> 01:16:44.034
- How are you even
able to pull that off?

1888
01:16:44.068 --> 01:16:45.793
- She's my daughter.

1889
01:16:48.034 --> 01:16:49.000
- Oh my God.

1890
01:16:50.103 --> 01:16:53.103
- I love you. Dalton.

1891
01:16:53.137 --> 01:16:54.793
- I love you. thank you.

1892
01:16:54.827 --> 01:16:55.793
- I know.

1893
01:16:55.827 --> 01:16:57.000
- You can now go in.

1894
01:17:12.931 --> 01:17:14.241
- Hey. you okay?

1895
01:17:17.931 --> 01:17:21.896
- I am so proud of
you. you did amazing.

1896
01:17:25.793 --> 01:17:27.344
- Well. I couldn't have
done it without you.

1897
01:17:29.103 --> 01:17:31.241
This has literally been
the best Christmas ever.

1898
01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.068
- I heard that my son
is here. safe and sound.

1899
01:17:40.275 --> 01:17:45.068
You're safe. the whole family
was here to be a part of it.

1900
01:17:46.103 --> 01:17:49.206
I'm just filled with joy.

1901
01:17:49.241 --> 01:17:52.931
You know. I am
truly. truly blessed.

1902
01:17:52.965 --> 01:17:54.068
- We're blessed.

1903
01:17:56.241 --> 01:17:57.241
- Yeah. we are.

1904
01:17:58.827 --> 01:17:59.689
We are blessed.

1905
01:18:01.827 --> 01:18:04.103
- I've been thinking about
what you said last night.

1906
01:18:04.137 --> 01:18:05.862
- Hey. hey. hey. hey.

1907
01:18:05.896 --> 01:18:07.000
Don't even worry
about that. all right?

1908
01:18:09.206 --> 01:18:10.965
Your feelings are valid. okay?

1909
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.965
And I don't want you to feel

1910
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.344
like I'm forcing
you to do anything.

1911
01:18:16.379 --> 01:18:18.827
- I don't feel like
you're forcing me.

1912
01:18:18.862 --> 01:18:19.310
- Okay.

1913
01:18:21.137 --> 01:18:24.137
It's accepted. all right?

1914
01:18:24.172 --> 01:18:25.482
But I want you to
know something.

1915
01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
I'm not going anywhere. okay?

1916
01:18:30.517 --> 01:18:33.965
And you can do whatever
you want. all right?

1917
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.103
As long as I'm here and I'm
with my family. I don't care.

1918
01:18:39.137 --> 01:18:40.448
it's the only thing I want.

1919
01:18:42.310 --> 01:18:43.241
- You mean that?

1920
01:18:44.896 --> 01:18:46.310
- Yeah.

1921
01:18:46.344 --> 01:18:47.103
- You're okay with me
doing whatever I want?

1922
01:18:47.137 --> 01:18:48.103
- Whatever you want.

1923
01:18:49.275 --> 01:18:50.310
- Okay. then

1924
01:19:00.896 --> 01:19:01.551
Ask me.

1925
01:19:02.896 --> 01:19:04.275
- Come on.

1926
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:05.896
- Ask me.

1927
01:19:22.068 --> 01:19:26.862
- I've been in love with you
since the first time I met you.

1928
01:19:28.586 --> 01:19:31.206
and I still feel the
same way to this day.

1929
01:19:35.206 --> 01:19:37.344
I will never leave you again.

1930
01:19:41.172 --> 01:19:43.034
I love you. Roz.

1931
01:19:47.103 --> 01:19:51.931
Will you for a second
time. for the last time.

1932
01:19:53.413 --> 01:19:54.551
