4
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.160
Football is a religion around the country.

5
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.720
Everyone I knew played
AFL football. and you just played it.

6
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.120
Or had talent.

7
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.880
But I also make no apologies for
working my backside off and sacrificing.

8
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.040
O'Loughlin. two-time
All-Australian player. What a champion.

9
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.360
I would string one game. two games.

10
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.880
500th goal for the
indigenous team of the century star.

11
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.040
Michael O'Loughlin.

12
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.720
Magnificent.

13
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.160
So. it changed our life.

14
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.160
But what a day
for Michael O'Loughlin.

15
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.800
the first ever to play 300 games

16
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.640
for the Sydney Swans.

17
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.160
Sport brings people together.

18
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.440
You know. we're playing this
amazing game called AFL Football.

19
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.440
When I'm running out onto a field. you
represent your family and your community.

20
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.240
It's not a burden. it's a really
amazing thing. Gives me strength.

21
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.200
Racism is alive and well in Australia and
what's happening on the field is. I guess.

22
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.840
a bit of a reflection of what's happening
on the other side of the fence in society.

23
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.920
You know. a lot of lot of
non-Aboriginal people say oh get over it.

24
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.760
Well. you know what? You can't get
over it if it's happening all the time.

25
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.320
I was getting it when I was under 12.
and what it does to me--

26
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.520
it brings back memories.
and I get really upset.

27
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.080
It just hurts. And I was racially abused
last week and the week before that.

28
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.840
I'm sick of it.
I'm sick of fighting.

29
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.600
When are you going out and
playing a game in front of 70.000 people

30
00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.600
and to have
someone over the fence yell out

31
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.640
"Monkey" or "Abo" or "black dog".
it takes the wind out of your sails.

32
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.120
How do Aboriginal people
find the strength to stare that down?

33
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.680
It's-- it's-- It's a huge task.

34
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.360
Tarryn Thomas.

35
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.160
Our younger generation can overtake us
and lead this country into the future.

36
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.600
He's gonna make sure of it.
Michael Walters!

37
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.600
It's quite simple
how people wanna change.

38
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.480
There's still
a lot of healing that needs to be done.

39
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.040
You've got to make an impact.
and you've got to leave

40
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.840
the place in a better place
than when you found it.

41
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.960
Growing up. I was dragged to football
matches by my uncles and my father.

42
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.240
My mother. Like watching it
and sort of participating

43
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.400
and I sort of picked it up quite easily.

44
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.160
-Good ticket? No?
-I'll Facebook you.

45
00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.840
I can't help you.

46
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.920
Oh yeah. I can
get a kick here. you know?

47
00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.880
Then I can go to another game
and I could get a kick.

48
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.200
and I'm thinking okay. I can do this.

49
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.360
-Are you in this one too?
-Yeah yeah.

50
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.320
No worries. guys.

51
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.160
Yeah. it was football in front of me.
and I just knew what to do with it.

52
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.400
Hey. man. Hello.

53
00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.560
It was quite-- came quite naturally
and it was quite easy.

54
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.200
You know the feel of the footy.
the way it bounced-- I could see it.

55
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.840
and it was gonna go that way
or it was gonna go that way.

56
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.720
I just-- I don't know. It was just
that was really sort of natural.

57
00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.800
don't I. ay?

58
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.040
Then as you go and
sort of become a professional.

59
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.520
there's a lot of things you gotta work on.

60
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.440
The rules of AFL football...

61
00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.160
is there are no rules to AFL football.

62
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.680
Back it comes.
He's in good touch. the big man.

63
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.640
You got 18 players from each team.

64
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.360
all trying to find some space
to get their hands on the ball.

65
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.720
It's a bit like hot potato. The ball
just keeps buzzing around the ground.

66
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.760
The skill is really unique.
When you're up close in a stadium

67
00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.920
with 70.000 people. it's incredible.

68
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.440
Yeah.

69
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.200
I love it.
my family loves it.

70
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.600
our community loves it.
and Australia loves it.

71
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.440
Parker picks it up.
wheels on his right boot.

72
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.280
heads goalward. and kicks their third.

73
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.240
How would I describe my mum?
Um...

74
00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.520
Muriel is. uh. very strong-willed.
Very determined.

75
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.560
I think. uh...

76
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.000
I think she can come across
as really disciplined and hard.

77
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.960
Hello.

78
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.240
But she's she's an
absolute softy underneath it all.

79
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.360
-Hello.
-Hello.

80
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.800
-How are you?
-Good. good. good.

81
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.320
-Lovely to see you. yes.
-My mate!

82
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.840
She took an interest in everything
that we did. So. whether it was sport

83
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.200
or what was going on at school or whatever
it was. she was always there so...

84
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.760
But she's-- she's
an incredible. incredible mum.

85
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.280
Good to see you. ay?
You're good?

86
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.120
All good. yes?
How was your trip?

87
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.360
Yeah. it was fairly long-- a long
flight but we got here in the end.

88
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.640
-I think Rick is going to pick Derek up.
-Yeah?

89
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.080
Yeah. we're going to
go down to Salisbury North.

90
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.720
Oh. good. That's lovely. yeah.

91
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.120
There was a lot of interest in
sport at that time and footy. and I think

92
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.840
Michael. being very young
at the time. just absorbed all that

93
00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:03.080
enthusiasm. family gatherings.
and was just naturally gifted with

94
00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.720
picking up a ball
and kicking the ball around

95
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.640
with these brothers
and cousins and uncles.

96
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.440
And there was always
a football around. huh?

97
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.680
Always. Always was.

98
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.560
-A lot of broken windows.
-Broken windows and...

99
00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.160
Balls over the fence.

100
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.400
Jump the fence. go and get the ball.

101
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.600
Family means a lot and they
offered support wherever. whenever.

102
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.400
Because Michael
had a quite an extended family.

103
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.760
Cousins by the dozens.

104
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.880
-I think everyone when they popped over--
-Popped over to have a footy.

105
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.720
I was like.
Uncle. come and kick the footy.

106
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.240
And you can see
sometimes they'd roll their eyes

107
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.640
but they'd come out and kick with you.

108
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.360
-So. it was like...
-Yeah.

109
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.960
Everywhere I went.
If I was going the shop.

110
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.680
I'd bounce the ball or whatever.
I mean. took it to school.

111
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.040
-Everywhere I'd go.
-Oh. absolutely.

112
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.880
-On the school bus...
-But we were fortunate.

113
00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.840
because where we live. there was

114
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.160
Auntie and Uncle up here
around the corner here.

115
00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.480
Nana was around the corner.

116
00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.720
So. there was just everyone in
this community at Salisbury North

117
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.480
that they just looked after each other.

118
00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.880
Some of the lessons that
you learn along that journey from

119
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.520
your aunties and your uncles.
and especially in the football sense.

120
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.240
about looking after yourself.
staying off the drink.

121
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.920
So. that was drummed
into me really early as well.

122
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.040
Um... And then they spoke about a lot
of the stuff with racism around sport.

123
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.080
but it was always about. you know.
don't let that mess around with your game.

124
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.640
Keep concentrating on the football.

125
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.720
And I guess there was times
where you wanted to fight. but...

126
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.040
had to pull it back and just concentrate.
as angry as I was on the footy field

127
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.880
as a junior growing up and being called
all these different names.

128
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.680
I knew that. you know. my Nana and my mum
were watching and were always like. "Oi!

129
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.400
Come on. stop fighting.
go back for the footy."

130
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.080
I knew early on that we had challenges.

131
00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.960
So. where we lived and not much money.

132
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.320
So. people were-- certainly our
people were-- always sort of floating

133
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.240
in and out of the football club.

134
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.480
That was just the place where
I hung out and made great friends and

135
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.320
played cricket there in the summer
and football in the winter.

136
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.240
So. everyone owned a footy. and it was
easy to find someone to have a kick with.

137
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:23.880
What's not to love?

138
00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:33.600
Wasn't till I probably got to sort of 12.
and I started making sort of rep sides.

139
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.560
and I thought
oh. okay. I'm all right at this thing.

140
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.400
And then. I think it was my mum
and she said.

141
00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.000
'You know that Clare gets paid lots
of money to play football?"

142
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:41.960
And I was blown away.

143
00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.800
I didn't know
you could get paid to play football.

144
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.280
It blew my mind. and I went
"Oh. what?" And that was it.

145
00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.080
And I thought football. in my mind.

146
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:56.280
I can play. be really good.
and I can help change

147
00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.920
my family's path what we're on.

148
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.320
You know. five boys
in one room. all in bunk beds.

149
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.880
and cousins sleeping
on the floor. Like. I thought

150
00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.720
I can buy my mum a house here.
or I could do something if I'm any good.

151
00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:18.360
He was still in high school in year 12
when the Swans came around to to visit.

152
00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.680
We were like. "What are they doing here?
What are-- what do these holders want?"

153
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.360
And we had no idea what to expect.

154
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.520
What-- I just thought oh. wow.
It was exciting.

155
00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.160
it was scary. it was all
these different things.

156
00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.120
Yeah. it was.

157
00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.160
It was a bit of
a culture shock from a local. uh.

158
00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.200
community footy club
into an AFL environment.

159
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.400
Um. it was a...

160
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.240
-Yeah. Shock to the system.
-Scary thing for all of us. actually.

161
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.920
The change from Salisbury North
to Sydney was a huge step.

162
00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.320
After the first week. I was done.

163
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:55.720
I was ready to go back to Adelaide and
and go and live with Mum and work locally

164
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.680
and play for Salisbury North.

165
00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.240
But again. really strong people
in my life.

166
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:04.040
My mother. "There is nothing here for you.
You have to stay with this opportunity.

167
00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.960
It's too good to pass up. Not many
people get an opportunity like this."

168
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:19.360
I look at a young Tarryn Thomas whose
story. to me. looks exactly the same.

169
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.240
Tough neighbourhood. moved away
from home-- a long way from home--

170
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.440
to try and live his dream.

171
00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.720
All by himself!

172
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.640
Inside 50. Tarryn Thomas.

173
00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:38.080
As a kid. Tarryn was great.
energetic. competitive.

174
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.760
Exhausting.

175
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.120
That passion. I think.
got him really to where he is today.

176
00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.880
A talented young roo.
and he's put it right through.

177
00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.560
This is a really positive start
from North.

178
00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.640
Two goals on the board.
and the cats have two behind.

179
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.560
Tarryn. I obviously watched him
from afar.

180
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.240
And I think for him now.
it's just the consistency of effort.

181
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.240
I think that's what separates
really good players from great players.

182
00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:24.760
Scoring a goal.
and the crowd is up and about again.

183
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:29.080
There's some responsibility about that.
and he'll find his voice will get

184
00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:33.280
louder and he'll become. you know.
more confident.

185
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.920
Yeah. I'm not a big talker. but...
I'd rather have my footy do the talking.

186
00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:43.800
Didwell. Thomas.
Tarryn Thomas turns. kicks. goals.

187
00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.960
Every time I step
on the field. I...

188
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.160
think of my ancestors and...

189
00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.640
yeah. all the brother boys
that came before me.

190
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.480
Yeah. I'm just very proud that I
can put on a jumper and play and

191
00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.280
tell people my story on the field.

192
00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.640
And he kicks long
and hits Tarryn Thomas

193
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:08.400
Lights out. on the run.
He's got no one forward. though.

194
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.200
He's sitting out front.

195
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.360
It rolled all the way home anyway!

196
00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:23.440
I think the young guy has
this enormous potential to be

197
00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.960
a really great player in the
league for a long period of time.

198
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.880
That could set him and his
family up for the rest of their lives.

So. it's sort of like we never stopped.

207

The proudest--
proudest I can be.

211
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.080
You know. have my grandson--
watching him on television

every weekend playing AFL.

He's only got one man
ahead of him. and it's Thomas.

I reckon the first time it happened
to me was at school.

215
00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.360
I got called 'Black Dog'.

216
00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.240
And I didn't really know what it meant.

217
00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.000
But that didn't feel right.

218
00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.280
Back in my days we was--

219
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.920
never ever talked about
our Aboriginality at school.

220
00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.120
Like. because
none of that was taught to me.

221
00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:20.200
And I've got grandchildren today
wanting to know what tribe we're from.

222
00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:25.000
We're Kamilaroi tribe.
and their totem is the goanna.

223
00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:31.240
To me. people
don't think that we've got a heart.

224
00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.640
You know. just because of
the colour of our skin and stuff.

225
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.560
Yeah. I'll do anything
for Mom and brothers and sisters

To change.
We do need a change.

230
00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:03.280
But having someone like Tarryn to do this
makes me proud.

231
00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.040
Sorry.

232
00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.280
It's amazing. How do you feel. mate?

233
00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.080
Like. I've just got the hairs on
the back of the neck stand up.

234
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.040
I very proud. Walking past.
I'll still get goosebumps.

235
00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:42.440
But I can see treaty and respect there.
and such an iconic pose as well.

236
00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.320
Yeah. I love when they
took the knee before games

237
00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.240
or everyone in the public took a knee.

238
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.760
So. I think that's very
powerful having that voice.

239
00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:58.560
Especially having my photo
on the wall really relates

240
00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.960
to my community saying no to racism.

All black fellows as everyone. as one.

and everyone to come together.

Just sort of the pose and what
that represents back in America

244
00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.760
where it all sort of started
with Black Lives Matter movement.

245
00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.760

has expanded around the world.

into the 70s that the doors opened for us.

those doors down because it was the

-Yeah.
-I mean. indigenous round.

298
00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:37.960
Incredible for our people.

299

Always good to
showcase our culture on a big stage.

300
00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:44.240
-What does it mean to you?
-Oh. it's-- it's inspiration. It's pride.

301
00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.400
The Marngrook round is
a pretty special round

302
00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.960
for all the indigenous players

303
00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:54.560
that are playing in
the men's and women's competition

304
00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.240
And I know every player loves

305
00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.840
to put on their jumper with
the indigenous design to go out.

306
00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.680
represent our football club.
but also our culture and where we're from.

307
00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.880
The game of marngrook.
you know. there was these tribes that were

308
00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:17.280
playing the possum skin filled with
charcoal and stitched together.

309
00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.080
and the ball just be sort of going
everywhere and there was many as 50

310
00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:24.320
to 60 people were trying to
all get their hands on the ball.

311
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.760
One of the founders of the AFL
saw this and went. 'Wow.

312
00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.440
'This is an incredible. fast-paced.

313
00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.280
It's got plenty of action involved.'

314
00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.320
And I think the game of AFL
evolved from that.

315
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:41.000
Now we have multiple players
of our mob playing the game.

316
00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:44.680
It's the time to shine and it's--
they leave their mark on the game.

317
00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.880
...takes a magnificent grab!

318
00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:03.080
First game is one that
still sort of blows my mind.

319
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.920
O'Loughlin's got it.
Can he produce some magic?

320
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.960
Back to O'Loughlin.
O'Loughlin kicks the goal!

321
00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.480
Magnificent!

322
00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.920
Everyone I knew growing up
was watching.

323
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.200
O'Loughlin keeps it in.

324
00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:20.040
He's good enough from there.

325
00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:21.960
I reckon there were some people
who were surprised

326
00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.360
to even see me on the field
