00:01:50.068 --> 00:01:52.771
- 1900 hours. cruising as before.

4
00:01:53.822 --> 00:01:58.827
1900 hours.
cruising as before. so noted.

5
00:02:00.995 --> 00:02:01.995
- Evening.

6
00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:04.824
anything interesting?

7
00:02:04.874 --> 00:02:07.210
- Just keeping an eye on our course.

8
00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:09.337
Marcus has me as acting navigator

9
00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.381
since we ended up shorthanded.

10
00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:13.583
- How about young Royce.

11
00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:14.759
how's he doing?

12
00:02:15.885 --> 00:02:17.470
- Well enough.

13
00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:20.423
You know. it's morning
back home right now.

14
00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:21.174
- Homesick?

15
00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:22.392
- Of course not.

16
00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:24.636
- I do loathe children.

17
00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:26.513
That bad?

18
00:02:26.563 --> 00:02:28.723
- He needs some discipline
kicked into him.

19
00:02:28.773 --> 00:02:29.773
But I'll admit.

20
00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:30.600
it will be nice to have

21
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.169
a dedicated electronic warfare specialist

22
00:02:32.193 --> 00:02:32.977
with us this time.

23
00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:35.647
Conn. SepMOD.

24
00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:36.781
- Conn. aye.

25
00:02:38.032 --> 00:02:41.111
- Strobing contact bearing 040 by 022.

26
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:44.114
Distance approximately
2.5 million Ahrimans.

27
00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:45.323
- ID?

28
00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:47.826
It looked clean
until about 15 seconds ago.

29
00:02:47.876 --> 00:02:49.994
Now I'm getting flashes
of a scrambled signal.

30
00:02:50.044 --> 00:02:52.664
She looks to pass close at
present course and speed

31
00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:55.592
about 1.100 Ahrimans off our
starboard side. high to low.

32
00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:58.211
Mr. Barrows?

33
00:02:58.261 --> 00:02:59.921
- Mr. Masterson?

34
00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:01.756
- Shall we go to quarters?

35
00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:04.634
- Well. that's the kind of
decision you were hired to make.

36
00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:05.468
- Sir?

37
00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:06.469
- Choice is yours.

38
00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.222
Have it sounded or call
the captain and ask him.

39
00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:10.666
- Abner. I'm the XO. I should really...

40
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.642
- No. you really shouldn't.

41
00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:13.836
Give him a chance to earn his pay.

42
00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:15.478
Conn SepMOD.

43
00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:17.355
contact confirmed as blacklisted ship.

44
00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:20.275
We have full legal authority
to destroy or seize.

45
00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:22.493
Designating contact as 'Target One.'

46
00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:26.623
- Time's wasting mister.

47
00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:29.868
- Sound general quarters.

48
00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:31.369
all hands to battle stations.

49
00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.403
- Abner. he really should
have deferred to me

50
00:03:39.427 --> 00:03:42.847
after all I am the executive
officer of this ship.

51
00:03:46.267 --> 00:03:48.645
- Of course. you're absolutely right.

52
00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:55.768
- Magazines manned and ready.

53
00:03:55.818 --> 00:03:57.896
- Hydra One mount
reports manned and ready.

54
00:03:57.946 --> 00:03:59.606
- Cobra mount reports manned and ready.

55
00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:01.065
- Hydra Two manned and ready.

56
00:04:01.115 --> 00:04:02.734
- Quad mount reports manned and ready.

57
00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:04.569
- Hydra Twin mount
reports manned and ready.

58
00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:06.571
- All guns manned and ready.

59
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:09.616
- What's happening?

60
00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:10.867
Why are we at the quarters?

61
00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:12.493
- New contact Captain.

62
00:04:12.543 --> 00:04:13.646
high on the bow to starboard.

63
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.921
It's blacklisted.

64
00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:18.508
- Why was I informed by
the alarms instead of you?

65
00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:20.501
- I considered...

66
00:04:20.551 --> 00:04:21.844
- Then why didn't you?

67
00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:25.965
We'll talk about this later.

68
00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:28.051
I have the Conn. threat board on one.

69
00:04:29.143 --> 00:04:30.454
Combat condition.

70
00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:32.013
sealing pressure doors.

71
00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:37.060
- She'll pass right abeam of us.

72
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.020
- Couldn't ask for a better setup.

73
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.022
- SepMOD. distance to target.

74
00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:42.132
Contact has closed distance

75
00:04:42.156 --> 00:04:43.191
to 2 million Ahrimans.

76
00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:45.985
Speed is constant at 200.000 APH.

77
00:04:46.035 --> 00:04:47.403
- She's drifting.

78
00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:49.030
Trying to sneak through undetected.

79
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.282
- Who generated the blacklist warrant?

80
00:04:51.332 --> 00:04:52.434
The Arkwright family.

81
00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:00.333
- The Arkwrights?

82
00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:02.677
We're collecting bounties
for those beasts?

83
00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:05.805
- Keep those thoughts to yourself.

84
00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:09.842
If you need a reason this
means serious prize money.

85
00:05:19.527 --> 00:05:20.728
- Maneuvering. Conn.

86
00:05:20.778 --> 00:05:23.273
Bring the reactor to 100%.

87
00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:26.234
Stand by to commence
flank speed operations.

88
00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:27.944
- Max output. aye.

89
00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:30.697
Reactors one and two. latch
the rods and lift to the stops.

90
00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:32.365
- Aye. sir. latching and lifting.

91
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.793
- We could try pushing her a little bit.

92
00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:44.627
- Not this time.

93
00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:46.971
let's see how she handles
ordinary combat first.

94
00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:49.757
- Helm. correct course and angle

95
00:05:49.807 --> 00:05:51.384
to match the target.

96
00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:52.802
And prepare to reverse.

97
00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:54.762
- Aye. sir. adjusting course.

98
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:09.319
- Contact has closed distance
to 1.4 million Ahrimans.

99
00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:11.988
Stand by... confirmed classification.

100
00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:13.906
Bolton Class freighter.

101
00:06:13.956 --> 00:06:15.750
Looks like she's even older than we are.

102
00:06:18.127 --> 00:06:19.704
- Focus on your jobs. please.

103
00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:21.080
Let's not have her getting away.

104
00:06:22.006 --> 00:06:24.133
Target course matched.

105
00:06:25.093 --> 00:06:26.210
- All back standard.

106
00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.137
- Aye. sir. all back standard.

107
00:06:39.982 --> 00:06:41.434
- Nice and smooth.

108
00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:43.186
- Just like my dad's clipper.

109
00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:44.312
- Burn up 20%.

110
00:06:44.362 --> 00:06:45.605
Burn up 20%. aye.

111
00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:46.799
Contact approaching steady.

112
00:06:52.453 --> 00:06:53.237
- After this patrol.

113
00:06:53.287 --> 00:06:55.206
you should come on another trip with us.

114
00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.040
- Um...

115
00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:58.227
Yeah. that sounds nice

116
00:06:58.251 --> 00:06:59.994
but this freighter won't catch itself.

117
00:07:00.044 --> 00:07:01.063
What's she doing?

118
00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:02.687
She should be trying to evade us by now.

119
00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:04.691
Captain. target
has increased speed

120
00:07:04.715 --> 00:07:07.126
to 201.000 APH and is accelerating.

121
00:07:07.176 --> 00:07:08.461
- She's gunning it. Marcus!

122
00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:10.129
- All hands brace.

123
00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:11.179
Flank reverse!

124
00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:20.723
Don't call me by first
name in front of the men.

125
00:07:20.773 --> 00:07:23.518
Captain. target
one is veering to starboard.

126
00:07:23.568 --> 00:07:25.895
- Cut burn to 80%.

127
00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:27.647
Full burn on port.

128
00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:31.734
three quarters on starboard
bow tips for 15 seconds.

129
00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:48.918
Comms. transmit a desist
order and identify us.

130
00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:51.345
Cobra mount. prepare a
warning shot over her bow.

131
00:07:53.431 --> 00:07:55.925
Chief. the threat board just went out.

132
00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:57.385
- Recycling the input. sir.

133
00:07:57.435 --> 00:07:59.595
Conn. Target
One is slowing down now.

134
00:07:59.645 --> 00:08:01.597
Attention all passengers.

135
00:08:01.647 --> 00:08:03.641
the new year has arrived!

136
00:08:03.691 --> 00:08:06.894
The party is in full swing on C deck!

137
00:08:06.944 --> 00:08:08.354
Where are you?

138
00:08:08.404 --> 00:08:10.440
Get on down and join the celebration!

139
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.274
- What is that?

140
00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:12.567
Who is playing that?

141
00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:13.677
- I'm sorry Captain it's...

142
00:08:13.701 --> 00:08:14.485
- What are you doing?

143
00:08:14.535 --> 00:08:16.112
- It's part of an old system.

144
00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:18.197
A virtual personality for tourists.

145
00:08:18.247 --> 00:08:19.198
Her name's Claire.

146
00:08:19.248 --> 00:08:21.284
some of our components
were purchased second hand

147
00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:22.710
off of an old cruise liner.

148
00:08:22.793 --> 00:08:24.996
- We encountered her
during the shakedown run.

149
00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:27.748
Captain Timmons had all
of her code removed.

150
00:08:27.798 --> 00:08:29.959
I don't see how she can
still be functioning.

151
00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:31.210
Stars and garters.

152
00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.880
have we got the event of a
lifetime lined up for you!

153
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:36.382
Captain. target slowing further.

154
00:08:36.432 --> 00:08:37.600
- Shut her up.

155
00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:41.137
- Marc... Captain I think
he's trying to back down

156
00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:42.388
and run the other way.

157
00:08:42.438 --> 00:08:43.689
- Shut her OFF!

158
00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:46.851
Fire the warning shot!

159
00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:47.901
- Cobra mount. fire!

160
00:08:51.155 --> 00:08:52.591
No change in target course.

161
00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:55.651
- All hands brace. reverse thrust.

162
00:08:55.701 --> 00:08:56.701
All ahead one quarter.

163
00:08:56.744 --> 00:08:57.528
Aye. sir.

164
00:09:10.508 --> 00:09:12.843
- Mr. Saverin. please
prepare to disable her.

165
00:09:14.595 --> 00:09:15.755
Fire at her with. uh.

166
00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:17.465
I think half shots will do the trick.

167
00:09:23.437 --> 00:09:25.139
- All guns target her forward engines.

168
00:09:25.189 --> 00:09:26.974
Hydra One. load half shots.

169
00:09:27.024 --> 00:09:29.185
- Comms. any acknowledgement yet?

170
00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:30.295
- It's a little funny. Captain.

171
00:09:30.319 --> 00:09:32.021
We may have just heard a channel open.

172
00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:34.649
then close again. nothing further.

173
00:09:34.699 --> 00:09:38.152
- Very well. disable
her please Mr Saverin.

174
00:09:38.202 --> 00:09:39.612
- Hydra One. fire.

175
00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:40.738
- Fire.

176
00:09:43.666 --> 00:09:45.451
- Weapon missed. leading target.

177
00:09:45.501 --> 00:09:46.452
Adjust to minus 4.

178
00:09:46.502 --> 00:09:47.787
- Adjust and fire.

179
00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:54.210
- Adjust and fire.

180
00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.212
- Adjusting minus 4. firing!

181
00:10:01.183 --> 00:10:02.134
- Hit. Captain.

182
00:10:02.184 --> 00:10:04.845
- Confirmed. target's forward
engines appear to be disabled.

183
00:10:04.895 --> 00:10:06.347
She's spinning free.

184
00:10:06.397 --> 00:10:08.349
- Helm. cease forward thrust.

185
00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:09.934
burn reverse at one quarter.

186
00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:12.311
25 second burn.

187
00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:13.396
bring us alongside.

188
00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:15.606
we'll extend the MAG at 1.000 yards.

189
00:10:15.656 --> 00:10:16.566
Call it out Foley.

190
00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:17.733
Aye sir.

191
00:10:17.783 --> 00:10:19.277
- Mr. Royce. can we open their doors

192
00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:20.971
or do we have to do this
the old fashioned way?

193
00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:22.238
- It should be easy sir.

194
00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:24.782
They're shutting down
their communication systems

195
00:10:24.832 --> 00:10:26.518
like they think I'm gonna
hack them through that.

196
00:10:26.542 --> 00:10:28.494
They should be worried about the keyring.

197
00:10:28.544 --> 00:10:29.370
- Do we have a key?

198
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.664
- I'm checking now. sir.
but it's gonna take a while.

199
00:10:31.714 --> 00:10:32.873
- You don't have a while.

200
00:10:32.923 --> 00:10:35.001
Helm. continue your approach.

201
00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:35.918
Let's get into position.

202
00:10:35.968 --> 00:10:37.112
This needs to be handled quickly.

203
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:38.713
1.000 yards.

204
00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:39.797
Devil's distance captain.

205
00:10:39.847 --> 00:10:40.756
- Deploy the MAG.

206
00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:49.807
- Her rotation is slowing.

207
00:10:49.857 --> 00:10:51.192
she's dragging us with her.

208
00:11:05.122 --> 00:11:05.948
Five.

209
00:11:05.998 --> 00:11:06.998
four.

210
00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:07.825
three.

211
00:11:07.875 --> 00:11:08.951
two.

212
00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:09.785
one.

213
00:11:09.835 --> 00:11:11.537
- synchro.

214
00:11:11.587 --> 00:11:12.872
- Burn all tips to starboard.

215
00:11:12.922 --> 00:11:14.123
Reel us in.

216
00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:21.255
Extend the lock.

217
00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:25.142
Prepare a boarding action and take charge.

218
00:11:25.393 --> 00:11:26.602
- Aye. Captain.

219
00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:29.263
All compartments prepare
for boarding action.

220
00:11:29.313 --> 00:11:32.558
Mr. Merchov. assemble
your men at Airlock 4.

221
00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:35.319
- Best of luck. Tom.

222
00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:39.073
- You too... Marcus.

223
00:11:48.999 --> 00:11:50.519
Target One is fighting the MAG.

224
00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:51.786
- Royce. key?

225
00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:52.912
- Yeah. I've got it!

226
00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:53.962
For a second there.

227
00:11:54.004 --> 00:11:55.482
I thought I'd have to magic one up...

228
00:11:55.506 --> 00:11:56.757
- Are we ready to breach?

229
00:11:57.633 --> 00:11:58.633
- Yes. sir.

230
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.464
- All right boys.

231
00:12:03.514 --> 00:12:04.840
this is your first engagement.

232
00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.801
Remember your training
and put it into practice.

233
00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:07.994
Prepare to take your first trophies.

234
00:12:08.018 --> 00:12:10.104
Taham tan zanam!

235
00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:11.415
- Just stay where you are Mr. Hess.

236
00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:13.140
we've got this in hand.

237
00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:14.501
- The captain told me to take charge.

238
00:12:14.525 --> 00:12:16.769
- It's a mop up. not worth your attention.

239
00:12:16.819 --> 00:12:17.728
- I have my orders.

240
00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:23.067
- Very well. sir.

241
00:12:23.951 --> 00:12:26.195
Pressurizing the walkway!

242
00:12:26.245 --> 00:12:27.029
Var Shaw!

243
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.311
They've
dispersed through the air lock.

244
00:12:33.335 --> 00:12:35.255
Advancing towards the
bridge. Merchov commanding.

245
00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:36.690
Hamlin's fire team moving aft.

246
00:12:36.714 --> 00:12:38.382
Baldwin taking the crew quarters.

247
00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.461
Hamlin reports engineering secured.

248
00:12:42.511 --> 00:12:44.255
all hands in the space have surrendered.

249
00:12:44.305 --> 00:12:46.324
No resistance encountered
yet.  wait.

250
00:12:48.684 --> 00:12:51.178
Be advised. Baldwin has
encountered token resistance

251
00:12:51.228 --> 00:12:52.388
in the crew areas.

252
00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:53.939
Hamlin moving to assist.

253
00:12:55.024 --> 00:12:56.100
Nearing the bridge.

254
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.401
approaching with caution.

255
00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:03.816
Anyone else see that...?

256
00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:07.995
Resistance at the bridge. two men down!

257
00:13:15.336 --> 00:13:17.588
Surrender!

258
00:13:18.255 --> 00:13:19.799
Surrender...

259
00:13:21.133 --> 00:13:23.260
One moment sir...

260
00:13:25.554 --> 00:13:27.631
Ship secure
captain. she's ours.

261
00:13:27.681 --> 00:13:29.175
- YEAH!

262
00:13:35.731 --> 00:13:38.559
- That's one prize to us.

263
00:13:38.609 --> 00:13:40.394
Link us up. we'll do a tandem brake.

264
00:13:40.444 --> 00:13:41.395
Take a manifest.

265
00:13:41.445 --> 00:13:42.696
I'll be up there shortly.

266
00:13:44.365 --> 00:13:45.950
Well done. XO.

267
00:13:51.455 --> 00:13:53.082
- Well done. XO.

268
00:14:12.184 --> 00:14:13.677
- Foodstuffs. indeed!

269
00:14:13.727 --> 00:14:16.355
He's got enough weapons
back there to take Brasilia.

270
00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:19.809
Arms for the war on Perkunas. maybe?

271
00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:21.185
- Doesn't matter.

272
00:14:21.235 --> 00:14:23.270
These boys picked a fight
with the wrong oligarchs.

273
00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.148
- Wouldn't it be something if
these weapons were legitimate?

274
00:14:26.198 --> 00:14:28.025
I mean. I wouldn't put
it past the Arkwrights

275
00:14:28.075 --> 00:14:29.693
to file a false claim.

276
00:14:29.743 --> 00:14:31.403
- Odds are they're stolen.

277
00:14:31.453 --> 00:14:32.696
They're from Hoplon Arms

278
00:14:32.746 --> 00:14:34.490
and if you notice
somebody had a little fun

279
00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.866
with the serial numbers.

280
00:14:35.916 --> 00:14:37.409
- How do you know it's Hoplon?

281
00:14:37.459 --> 00:14:38.244
- I almost bought from them

282
00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:40.329
when we were outfitting our own marines.

283
00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:41.379
Good value for money

284
00:14:41.422 --> 00:14:43.624
but unfortunately their
Yankee founder won't have

285
00:14:43.674 --> 00:14:45.793
any business with independent colonials.

286
00:14:45.843 --> 00:14:48.087
- Your scholar's memory
serves us well. Captain.

287
00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:49.447
- You should have seen him in school.

288
00:14:49.471 --> 00:14:52.174
he could recite books from front to back.

289
00:14:52.224 --> 00:14:54.802
- Captain. Arkwright
vessel "Peerless Diligence"

290
00:14:54.852 --> 00:14:57.354
is alongside requesting clearance to dock.

291
00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:59.473
- Granted.

292
00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:06.739
- So. are we sticking around?

293
00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:10.693
- Make my apologies to
their commander personally.

294
00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:13.654
after that. get all of
our men off this ship.

295
00:15:13.704 --> 00:15:15.497
I want to be out of here
as soon as possible.

296
00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:46.687
- Why did you let Masterson
take us to quarters

297
00:15:46.737 --> 00:15:48.272
without informing me?

298
00:15:48.322 --> 00:15:50.149
- It's a standard practice.

299
00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:51.718
He and the crew need to learn their jobs

300
00:15:51.742 --> 00:15:53.277
and how to work together.

301
00:15:53.327 --> 00:15:54.653
And how to work with the ship.

302
00:15:54.703 --> 00:15:56.614
- You put this crew together Abner.

303
00:15:56.664 --> 00:15:59.199
and now you're telling us
they still need an education?

304
00:15:59.249 --> 00:16:00.117
- Tom...

305
00:16:00.167 --> 00:16:02.328
- It's quite all right. sir.

306
00:16:02.378 --> 00:16:05.205
I did the best I could with
the budget you gave me.

307
00:16:05.255 --> 00:16:07.791
Yes. I personally know
several of the officers.

308
00:16:07.841 --> 00:16:10.803
but they don't all know each
other and they don't know you.

309
00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.490
Young greenhorns like
Masterson still need a chance

310
00:16:13.514 --> 00:16:15.424
to make up their own minds under pressure.

311
00:16:15.474 --> 00:16:16.884
- I understand.

312
00:16:16.934 --> 00:16:19.553
But I must insist on
being kept in the loop.

313
00:16:19.603 --> 00:16:20.679
- Of course.

314
00:16:20.729 --> 00:16:22.749
But your fire control officer
doesn't need your help

315
00:16:22.773 --> 00:16:23.974
to do his job.

316
00:16:24.024 --> 00:16:26.518
- It seemed like the
right thing in the moment.

317
00:16:26.568 --> 00:16:28.896
- Well that's why your
father sent me along.

318
00:16:28.946 --> 00:16:30.230
to advise you. sir.

319
00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.483
- And what exactly does
that mean. in practice?

320
00:16:32.533 --> 00:16:35.069
You stopped me from
giving Masterson an order;

321
00:16:35.119 --> 00:16:37.821
that's a good deal more
than mere advice...

322
00:16:37.871 --> 00:16:40.908
- It was an order you didn't
need to give but don't worry.

323
00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:42.644
I'll make sure you both
get back home quickly

324
00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:44.244
and in one piece.

325
00:16:44.294 --> 00:16:45.079
That's my job.

326
00:16:45.129 --> 00:16:46.622
- Your point is taken. Abner.

327
00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:48.549
And we'll work on this going forward.

328
00:16:50.551 --> 00:16:54.096
You know what's getting to
me is that... that voice.

329
00:16:55.097 --> 00:16:56.491
I understand that the ship's components

330
00:16:56.515 --> 00:16:58.892
came from unusual places. but...

331
00:16:59.143 --> 00:17:00.803
We can't have that.

332
00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:02.888
It's an embarrassment and it's dangerous.

333
00:17:02.938 --> 00:17:04.723
- Young Royce is weeding
her out as we speak.

334
00:17:04.773 --> 00:17:06.892
- Has he started his qualification course?

335
00:17:06.942 --> 00:17:10.104
I want every officer to
be able to stand watch.

336
00:17:10.154 --> 00:17:11.855
- If I may make a suggestion. captain.

337
00:17:11.905 --> 00:17:13.699
you might focus on today's victory.

338
00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:16.344
Today's prize is worth a fair penny.

339
00:17:16.368 --> 00:17:18.904
and we bagged it right out of the gate.

340
00:17:18.954 --> 00:17:22.833
And... it was an excellent
learning experience.

341
00:17:27.379 --> 00:17:28.288
- Oh. that guy.

342
00:17:28.338 --> 00:17:30.841
I don't even know why we
have to have him with us.

343
00:17:36.472 --> 00:17:37.848
- To a fine start.

344
00:17:43.854 --> 00:17:45.147
- I can hardly believe it.

345
00:17:45.397 --> 00:17:46.181
- Believe what?

346
00:17:46.231 --> 00:17:48.475
- What we just did. What you just did!

347
00:17:48.525 --> 00:17:50.269
I mean. you have this junk ship

348
00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:51.687
and a patched together crew...

349
00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:54.398
- It was easy pickings and the
marines did most of the work.

350
00:17:54.448 --> 00:17:57.284
- You've have the greenest
marine outfit available

351
00:17:57.326 --> 00:17:59.246
- The approach was perfect
right out of the gate.

352
00:17:59.286 --> 00:18:00.966
You couldn't have asked
for a better setup.

353
00:18:00.996 --> 00:18:03.240
- And you've apparently
got the luck of the Irish.

354
00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:05.117
And I'm also the youngest

355
00:18:05.167 --> 00:18:06.994
and least experienced commanding officer

356
00:18:07.044 --> 00:18:08.045
in the entire fleet.

357
00:18:10.464 --> 00:18:12.132
- Always the bright side with you.

358
00:18:20.599 --> 00:18:22.434
- What do you suppose Lydia's up to?

359
00:18:24.853 --> 00:18:26.221
- Counting the corpses on the ship

360
00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:28.107
that we just captured for her daddy?

361
00:18:29.983 --> 00:18:31.711
- That's why you're
thinking of her. isn't it?

362
00:18:31.735 --> 00:18:32.735
That ship.

363
00:18:33.028 --> 00:18:34.214
- Maybe things would be better

364
00:18:34.238 --> 00:18:36.031
if I just went back and married her.

365
00:18:37.866 --> 00:18:40.569
Was it prideful of me to
reject her father's offer?

366
00:18:40.619 --> 00:18:43.238
- No. Your dad may have blown the fortune.

367
00:18:43.288 --> 00:18:45.741
but your family name
still means something.

368
00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:48.035
Abner certainly isn't here for the salary.

369
00:18:48.085 --> 00:18:49.729
- Yeah. we kind of blew
all the family favors

370
00:18:49.753 --> 00:18:50.996
on this trip. didn't we?

371
00:18:51.046 --> 00:18:52.581
- Better to exhaust all your options

372
00:18:52.631 --> 00:18:54.458
than get thrown with the Arkwrights.

373
00:18:54.508 --> 00:18:55.292
You marry Lydia

374
00:18:55.342 --> 00:18:57.237
and you're gonna be dangling
on the end of their strings

375
00:18:57.261 --> 00:18:58.279
for the rest of your life.

376
00:18:58.303 --> 00:19:00.798
- People will die for
our little enterprise.

377
00:19:00.848 --> 00:19:02.424
Two of our marines already did.

378
00:19:02.474 --> 00:19:06.261
They all take the risk: for
citizenship. for a career...

379
00:19:06.311 --> 00:19:09.264
for a little opportunity
to score some loot.

380
00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:11.975
- And don't forget us: here
to save the family farm.

381
00:19:12.025 --> 00:19:13.352
- We're here to prevent you

382
00:19:13.402 --> 00:19:16.480
from becoming some sort of mob husband.

383
00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:17.815
Learn to deal with Lydia later.

384
00:19:17.865 --> 00:19:19.825
and only if you have to.

385
00:19:21.618 --> 00:19:23.370
You about ready to open our orders?

386
00:19:27.875 --> 00:19:30.619
You'd have taken on that
freighter on your own. right?

387
00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:32.621
If Masterson hadn't
brought us to quarters?

388
00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:33.789
- Of course I would have.

389
00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:35.666
I told you. it was the perfect setup.

390
00:19:35.716 --> 00:19:36.500
- You know what?

391
00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:37.334
I didn't even need to ask.

392
00:19:37.384 --> 00:19:39.144
I could see it in your
eyes during the chase.

393
00:19:39.803 --> 00:19:41.088
We're all proud of you.

394
00:19:41.138 --> 00:19:42.631
Your dad's proud of you.

395
00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:45.634
We have to be aggressive out
here sometimes and you were.

396
00:19:45.684 --> 00:19:47.436
It was bold the way you handled it.

397
00:19:48.228 --> 00:19:49.396
Bold.

398
00:19:49.813 --> 00:19:50.639
A little more of that

399
00:19:50.689 --> 00:19:54.226
and you will avoid the cold
clutches of arranged matrimony.

400
00:19:54.276 --> 00:19:58.155
Unless that's... what you want?

401
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.536
I'll leave you to it.

402
00:21:20.445 --> 00:21:22.085
Prize money on the first day!

403
00:21:23.657 --> 00:21:26.151
You know. I'm gonna get
my wife something nice

404
00:21:26.201 --> 00:21:27.527
when we get that bonus money.

405
00:21:27.577 --> 00:21:29.821
- Maybe this DeVol kids does
know a thing or two.

406
00:21:29.871 --> 00:21:32.157
Keeps up like this. we're
all going home loaded.

407
00:21:32.207 --> 00:21:33.408
- How about you. Abel?

408
00:21:33.458 --> 00:21:34.743
You got family back home?

409
00:21:34.793 --> 00:21:35.793
- Not really.

410
00:21:36.586 --> 00:21:37.913
- Sure you do.

411
00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:40.332
Who else would be on that
message you keep playing back

412
00:21:40.382 --> 00:21:42.084
when you don't think anyone's looking?

413
00:21:42.134 --> 00:21:43.877
- None of your business. Dimitri.

414
00:21:43.927 --> 00:21:45.446
- This ship needs a name. don't you think?

415
00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:46.838
- She's got a name.

416
00:21:46.888 --> 00:21:48.924
- Chimera's not much of a name for a lady.

417
00:21:48.974 --> 00:21:49.800
- She's scrap.

418
00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:50.634
- Scrap?

419
00:21:50.684 --> 00:21:52.161
Hell. she's our ticket
through Port Shelley.

420
00:21:52.185 --> 00:21:54.763
You know. the captain's father.
he's the governor there.

421
00:21:54.813 --> 00:21:57.557
He decides which folks did
enough to get citizenship.

422
00:21:57.607 --> 00:22:00.602
They say he's got a
reputation for generosity.

423
00:22:00.652 --> 00:22:02.571
- Yeah. shut up. Salles.

424
00:22:02.779 --> 00:22:04.564
Shelley? She's tougher than she looks.

425
00:22:04.614 --> 00:22:07.701
- Shelley. like "Port Shelley." I
could get behind that.

426
00:22:07.993 --> 00:22:09.304
- Wait. we're just going
to call it Shelley?

427
00:22:09.328 --> 00:22:10.930
- I didn't know what we
were going to get into

428
00:22:10.954 --> 00:22:13.323
when I signed on. but
she's proven herself now.

429
00:22:13.373 --> 00:22:15.742
So what if her bits have mileage.

430
00:22:15.792 --> 00:22:17.703
they're well loved. they work.

431
00:22:17.753 --> 00:22:18.537
- So far.

432
00:22:18.587 --> 00:22:19.371
- I'm serious.

433
00:22:19.421 --> 00:22:20.940
- We're really just
going to call it Shelley?

434
00:22:20.964 --> 00:22:22.541
- I'm serious too.

435
00:22:22.591 --> 00:22:24.152
Didn't you hear the word out of the yards?

436
00:22:24.176 --> 00:22:24.960
What?

437
00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:25.794
Yeah. it's a captured ship

438
00:22:25.844 --> 00:22:28.046
repaired with pieces from
all kinds of other ships.

439
00:22:28.096 --> 00:22:30.424
- Not captured. salvaged.

440
00:22:30.474 --> 00:22:33.385
Two ships. they get different
halves blown off in battle.

441
00:22:33.435 --> 00:22:34.469
All hands lost.

442
00:22:34.519 --> 00:22:36.638
And the admiralty decides
to make the best of it

443
00:22:36.688 --> 00:22:38.682
by welding two ends together.

444
00:22:38.732 --> 00:22:41.393
Why do you think she's the
only hybrid class in the fleet?

445
00:22:41.443 --> 00:22:43.645
Ships like this get sold
at cheap foreign navies

446
00:22:43.695 --> 00:22:47.115
not commissioned as vessels of the State.

447
00:22:48.492 --> 00:22:51.370
- So you're saying that we're
sailing a pair of coffins?

448
00:22:52.079 --> 00:22:52.863
- I guess so.

449
00:22:52.913 --> 00:22:54.197
- I thought I smelled something.

450
00:22:54.247 --> 00:22:55.391
- You're full of crap. Salles.

451
00:22:55.415 --> 00:22:56.533
- Yeah. maybe that's it.

452
00:22:56.583 --> 00:22:59.453
- Hate to burst your dreams of
becoming respectable citizens

453
00:22:59.503 --> 00:23:01.913
but you can check it all out
for yourselves when we put in.

454
00:23:01.963 --> 00:23:04.333
It's incontrovertible.

455
00:23:04.383 --> 00:23:07.544
- incontra... where do you get off?

456
00:23:07.594 --> 00:23:09.004
You think you're so smart?

457
00:23:09.054 --> 00:23:11.173
You're just like the
rest of us. lonely peons.

458
00:23:11.223 --> 00:23:12.007
- That's not what I meant.

459
00:23:12.057 --> 00:23:13.258
- It is a little obnoxious.

460
00:23:13.308 --> 00:23:15.427
Just speak at a level
we can all appreciate.

461
00:23:15.477 --> 00:23:16.553
- Whatever.

462
00:23:16.603 --> 00:23:18.221
I fold.

463
00:23:18.271 --> 00:23:19.431
Philistines.

464
00:23:19.481 --> 00:23:20.849
- That's it. I've had it!

465
00:23:20.899 --> 00:23:21.683
- Whoa.
- Hey. hey!

466
00:23:21.733 --> 00:23:22.517
It's not worth it.

467
00:23:22.567 --> 00:23:24.019
It's all right. man. take it easy.

468
00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:25.737
- Attention on deck!

469
00:23:30.742 --> 00:23:32.702
- What's all this about?

470
00:23:36.248 --> 00:23:37.499
- Nothing. sir.

471
00:23:39.793 --> 00:23:41.328
- Come with me. Salles.

472
00:23:41.378 --> 00:23:42.162
- Sir. I didn't-

473
00:23:42.212 --> 00:23:43.914
- You're being detached from gunnery.

474
00:23:43.964 --> 00:23:45.132
I need a new assistant.

475
00:23:46.007 --> 00:23:48.585
Mr. Saverin's already done the paperwork.

476
00:23:48.635 --> 00:23:50.170
Come on.

477
00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.805
Come on.

478
00:24:01.273 --> 00:24:04.101
- Okay. first off.

479
00:24:04.151 --> 00:24:06.103
it's important you understand something

480
00:24:06.153 --> 00:24:07.771
that your predecessor didn't.

481
00:24:07.821 --> 00:24:08.822
- What's that?

482
00:24:10.323 --> 00:24:11.408
- You know nothing.

483
00:24:13.577 --> 00:24:14.528
- Oh.

484
00:24:14.578 --> 00:24:17.823
- I can't waste time breaking
you of your assumptions.

485
00:24:17.873 --> 00:24:20.867
Aggregate displacement
confounds the best of minds.

486
00:24:20.917 --> 00:24:22.452
- Aggregate displacement?

487
00:24:22.502 --> 00:24:24.162
You mean the Static Shift Drive?

488
00:24:24.212 --> 00:24:25.872
Is that what I'll be working on?

489
00:24:25.922 --> 00:24:26.922
- That's right.

490
00:24:30.302 --> 00:24:32.504
- Never thought I'd worked
with an actual warp drive.

491
00:24:32.554 --> 00:24:34.339
Don't use the "W" word.

492
00:24:34.389 --> 00:24:35.924
We'll just laugh at you.

493
00:24:35.974 --> 00:24:39.094
Remember the first
lesson: you know nothing.

494
00:24:39.144 --> 00:24:40.178
- Right.

495
00:24:40.228 --> 00:24:42.514
You know. there's crazy rumors about SSDs.

496
00:24:42.564 --> 00:24:44.724
I always wondered what happens
if something goes wrong

497
00:24:44.774 --> 00:24:45.774
during a transit.

498
00:24:48.195 --> 00:24:51.022
- Best case. we end up off course

499
00:24:51.072 --> 00:24:53.241
due to a missed decimal
point or something.

500
00:24:54.242 --> 00:24:59.206
Worst case. our existences
explode across 16 dimensions.

501
00:24:59.873 --> 00:25:00.999
- Really?

502
00:25:01.625 --> 00:25:02.667
- No.

503
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:08.130
Go on.

504
00:25:26.483 --> 00:25:27.726
Enough breadboards in there

505
00:25:27.776 --> 00:25:31.688
to make the whole crew
sandwiches. Open face.

506
00:25:31.738 --> 00:25:33.240
- You're a dork...

507
00:25:34.449 --> 00:25:35.449
sir.

508
00:25:36.493 --> 00:25:38.620
- Only a dork would enjoy this.

509
00:25:40.038 --> 00:25:41.948
- I can't pretend I'm not interested.

510
00:25:41.998 --> 00:25:43.667
- Then perhaps I've chosen well.

511
00:25:44.626 --> 00:25:45.626
Here.

512
00:25:46.753 --> 00:25:48.413
get in there and remove the condensation

513
00:25:48.463 --> 00:25:49.923
from between the components.

514
00:25:51.174 --> 00:25:52.501
And be careful.

515
00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:54.386
The boards don't like to be bumped.

516
00:25:57.013 --> 00:26:00.509
Okay. so aggregate displacement.

517
00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:03.094
simply put it's a theory
of quantum science

518
00:26:03.144 --> 00:26:04.846
that allows the ship
to move from one point

519
00:26:04.896 --> 00:26:06.640
in the universe to another.

520
00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:09.351
Given enough power and
the right computations.

521
00:26:09.401 --> 00:26:10.894
it can instantaneously move you

522
00:26:10.944 --> 00:26:13.313
to any point in the universe.

523
00:26:13.363 --> 00:26:14.363
- Any point?

524
00:26:14.406 --> 00:26:15.406
- Any.

525
00:26:15.448 --> 00:26:18.693
- Like. even a point
billions of light years away.

526
00:26:18.743 --> 00:26:19.929
where no one else has ever been?

527
00:26:19.953 --> 00:26:20.737
- Sure.

528
00:26:20.787 --> 00:26:22.656
The more power you can
squeeze through the tube

529
00:26:22.706 --> 00:26:25.200
without frying it. the farther you can go.

530
00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:26.451
Understand though.

531
00:26:26.501 --> 00:26:29.663
it takes a fair bit just to
hop a couple of light years.

532
00:26:29.713 --> 00:26:32.791
The whole process is
extraordinarily sensitive.

533
00:26:32.841 --> 00:26:33.917
- How's that work?

534
00:26:33.967 --> 00:26:36.461
- You know. those fundamental
horrors of the universe

535
00:26:36.511 --> 00:26:38.722
that can drive a man
mad if he learns them?

536
00:26:41.099 --> 00:26:42.592
It's one of those.

537
00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:53.895
- I can't believe I'm working in here.

538
00:26:53.945 --> 00:26:55.464
I've heard people talk about guys like you

539
00:26:55.488 --> 00:26:56.489
like you're royalty.

540
00:26:57.574 --> 00:26:58.574
- We're just guys.

541
00:27:02.704 --> 00:27:03.704
- Sir..

542
00:27:06.041 --> 00:27:07.041
Thanks.

543
00:27:07.709 --> 00:27:08.577
I can't remember the last time

544
00:27:08.627 --> 00:27:11.079
someone really took a chance on me.

545
00:27:11.129 --> 00:27:12.172
You won't regret it.

546
00:27:13.632 --> 00:27:14.632
- No sweat.

547
00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:18.628
Anyway. for right now we're
just doing routine maintenance.

548
00:27:18.678 --> 00:27:20.755
We have to do this before every hop.

549
00:27:20.805 --> 00:27:22.257
- We're leaving the system?

550
00:27:22.307 --> 00:27:24.759
- Captain just told me to do my round.

551
00:27:24.809 --> 00:27:26.186
That usually means travel.

552
00:27:27.729 --> 00:27:29.598
- Gentlemen. we are no longer hunting down

553
00:27:29.648 --> 00:27:32.517
blacklists pirate ships to settle grudges.

554
00:27:32.567 --> 00:27:34.185
We can take prizes of opportunity.

555
00:27:34.235 --> 00:27:36.271
but our goal in mind is one ship.

556
00:27:36.321 --> 00:27:38.565
We are not a part of an
official fleet structure.

557
00:27:38.615 --> 00:27:41.192
but we are expected to
cooperate with other ships

558
00:27:41.242 --> 00:27:44.696
that have the same objective
in mind. allied or otherwise.

559
00:27:44.746 --> 00:27:46.156
- What kind of ship are we chasing?

560
00:27:46.206 --> 00:27:47.206
- We don't know.

561
00:27:49.751 --> 00:27:52.128
One of our allies was
able to take this picture.

562
00:27:53.963 --> 00:27:55.924
- Intelligence calls her the White Ship.

563
00:27:56.966 --> 00:27:59.803
She appears and attacks
ships seemingly at random.

564
00:28:01.304 --> 00:28:03.048
She bears no identifying markings

565
00:28:03.098 --> 00:28:05.433
other than her distinctive
coat of white paint.

566
00:28:06.393 --> 00:28:09.638
- Captain. may I ask who
gave us this information?

567
00:28:09.688 --> 00:28:12.182
- I'm not at liberty to be
specific about the source.

568
00:28:12.232 --> 00:28:13.683
- Of course not.
- Watch your tone.

569
00:28:13.733 --> 00:28:16.736
- It's all right. Gary. speak your mind.

570
00:28:18.154 --> 00:28:21.107
- Captain. our allies can't
even take a decent picture

571
00:28:21.157 --> 00:28:22.367
of what killed them.

572
00:28:23.243 --> 00:28:25.945
And if this massive ship even exists.

573
00:28:25.995 --> 00:28:28.448
our allies are probably hoping that either

574
00:28:28.498 --> 00:28:30.659
we're more competent than they are.

575
00:28:30.709 --> 00:28:33.119
or that we're better at
absorbing cannon fire.

576
00:28:33.169 --> 00:28:34.329
- Have some decency. Gary.

577
00:28:34.379 --> 00:28:35.547
- Oh. to hell with decency!

578
00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:38.625
The only reason we'd all cooperate

579
00:28:38.675 --> 00:28:40.695
is that we each expect each
other to lie down and die

580
00:28:40.719 --> 00:28:41.753
for our own success.

581
00:28:41.803 --> 00:28:42.545
- Gary!

582
00:28:42.595 --> 00:28:45.632
- I guarantee you they're
thinking exactly the same thing.

583
00:28:45.682 --> 00:28:48.727
- The chairman himself
has issued these orders.

584
00:28:50.562 --> 00:28:54.349
Every able vessel is being
called out to join in this hunt.

585
00:28:54.399 --> 00:28:58.144
Several of our courier ships
have already been destroyed.

586
00:28:58.194 --> 00:29:00.563
This is big.

587
00:29:00.613 --> 00:29:04.317
It strikes at the very heart
of our national industry.

588
00:29:04.367 --> 00:29:07.278
Without those ships we could
not provide the services

589
00:29:07.328 --> 00:29:09.406
that more or less fund our country.

590
00:29:09.456 --> 00:29:11.308
There's far more at stake
here than the interest

591
00:29:11.332 --> 00:29:13.585
of whatever nation first
called us into this.

592
00:29:14.544 --> 00:29:17.706
- All the more reason to keep
what Gary is saying in mind.

593
00:29:17.756 --> 00:29:18.756
Look.

594
00:29:19.966 --> 00:29:23.253
some of our "friends" may not necessarily

595
00:29:23.303 --> 00:29:24.929
have our best interests in mind.

596
00:29:25.805 --> 00:29:28.466
Still. we have as good a shot as anyone

597
00:29:28.516 --> 00:29:31.761
at finding this White Ship.

598
00:29:31.811 --> 00:29:33.188
if we play our cards right.

599
00:29:34.189 --> 00:29:35.189
- Thank you. Abner.

600
00:29:36.524 --> 00:29:38.526
And there's something else.

601
00:29:39.986 --> 00:29:43.606
Chairman Houser has
offered up a remarkable sum

602
00:29:43.656 --> 00:29:45.116
for the capture of this ship.

603
00:29:47.494 --> 00:29:49.871
He's marked half his
receipts from last quarter.

604
00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:54.584
and he's leaning on admiralty to match it.

605
00:29:59.547 --> 00:30:01.299
- Is that from his gross or net?

606
00:30:02.467 --> 00:30:03.467
- Gross.

607
00:30:05.053 --> 00:30:06.755
Last quarter was quite kind to him

608
00:30:06.805 --> 00:30:08.306
from the numbers I've seen.

609
00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:11.092
Now. all we have to do is make sure

610
00:30:11.142 --> 00:30:13.728
that we're part of the
group that finishes her off.

611
00:30:14.604 --> 00:30:16.431
- Well. I think we're
all with you. captain.

612
00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:18.483
So where do we start?

613
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:23.738
- We'll move out system and
hover at Cretcham Point.

614
00:30:24.572 --> 00:30:28.568
From there we'll make transition to...

615
00:30:33.832 --> 00:30:37.577
Here. the Prentiss system.

616
00:30:37.627 --> 00:30:39.504
right at the edge of the Deccan Abyss.

617
00:30:42.006 --> 00:30:43.666
Pretty far out.

618
00:30:43.716 --> 00:30:45.069
It's about the most we can do in one hop.

619
00:30:45.093 --> 00:30:48.046
Take a couple of days charging
before we could come back.

620
00:30:48.096 --> 00:30:50.507
- And awfully close to Yankee territory.

621
00:30:50.557 --> 00:30:53.101
- Everything out here is
close to Yankee territory.

622
00:30:57.981 --> 00:30:59.524
Why this area. captain?

623
00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.602
It's awful sparse traffic out there

624
00:31:02.652 --> 00:31:03.945
and a long way from home.

625
00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:09.150
It's unlikely we'll run into
anything. even other hunters.

626
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.594
- A lot of the attacks have taken place

627
00:31:10.618 --> 00:31:12.529
at the edge of the Deccan.

628
00:31:12.579 --> 00:31:13.905
I'm playing a hunch

629
00:31:13.955 --> 00:31:16.616
that they're making their
way around the brim.

630
00:31:16.666 --> 00:31:18.660
We can resupply at Hiram.

631
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:20.578
and then funnel it through
St. Nishith's Fell.

632
00:31:20.628 --> 00:31:22.580
the orbital station there.

633
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:23.998
- An ally?

634
00:31:24.048 --> 00:31:26.292
More like the only show in town.

635
00:31:26.342 --> 00:31:28.094
They'll be somebody to buy from there.

636
00:31:29.762 --> 00:31:30.839
Okay then.

637
00:31:30.889 --> 00:31:33.716
I expect all of you to carry
out your duties as usual.

638
00:31:33.766 --> 00:31:36.427
and to keep unnecessary
information from the crew.

639
00:31:36.477 --> 00:31:39.022
SepMOD operators will
have elevated privileges.

640
00:31:40.565 --> 00:31:41.565
Any questions?

641
00:31:44.611 --> 00:31:47.313
You may return to your duties.

642
00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:55.622
Bold!

643
00:32:18.311 --> 00:32:20.438
Something on your mind. Abner?

644
00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:23.141
- I'm just curious about this hunch.

645
00:32:23.191 --> 00:32:25.085
You really think they're
just making a clockwise tour

646
00:32:25.109 --> 00:32:26.903
of the Deccan's edge?

647
00:32:27.028 --> 00:32:29.322
- I said it was a hunch.

648
00:32:33.368 --> 00:32:35.995
- You already knew what our orders were.

649
00:32:36.704 --> 00:32:41.034
Not the usual generalities.
someone gave you specifics.

650
00:32:41.084 --> 00:32:46.089
- Prentiss is an educated guess.

651
00:32:47.298 --> 00:32:50.126
There's been some unusual
activity reported there

652
00:32:50.176 --> 00:32:51.920
the last few days.

653
00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:54.889
- And you think it's
really this White Ship?

654
00:32:56.683 --> 00:32:57.892
Well.

655
00:33:00.019 --> 00:33:02.689
it's a long way to go on a hunch.

656
00:33:03.272 --> 00:33:06.651
I admire your gumption. Captain.

657
00:33:35.596 --> 00:33:37.256
- Helm. Full stop and hover.

658
00:33:37.306 --> 00:33:39.300
- Aye sir. full stop and hover.

659
00:33:45.106 --> 00:33:47.058
All stop captain. trimming to hover.

660
00:33:52.572 --> 00:33:55.066
Trimming complete ship is hovering.

661
00:33:55.116 --> 00:33:57.785
- Mr. Hess we are ready
to commence the sequence.

662
00:33:59.579 --> 00:34:00.863
- Commencing sequence.

663
00:34:00.913 --> 00:34:02.782
60 seconds on my mark.

664
00:34:02.832 --> 00:34:07.662
Three. two. one mark.

665
00:34:07.712 --> 00:34:08.496
Comms.

666
00:34:08.546 --> 00:34:09.998
- Heads are rigged in and stowed.

667
00:34:10.048 --> 00:34:11.958
- LSO.
-  Stable.

668
00:34:12.008 --> 00:34:12.875
- Fire control.

669
00:34:12.925 --> 00:34:15.294
- Powered down. all
guns in locked position.

670
00:34:15.344 --> 00:34:16.671
- Maneuvering

671
00:34:16.721 --> 00:34:20.049
- SSD at standby. Reactors
at a hundred percent.

672
00:34:20.099 --> 00:34:22.468
All redundant systems are suspended.

673
00:34:22.518 --> 00:34:24.512
Mr Tamai. power the SSD.

674
00:34:24.562 --> 00:34:27.015
- Power SSD. aye sir.

675
00:34:27.065 --> 00:34:29.392
Operator. open her up steady.

676
00:34:29.442 --> 00:34:32.361
.

677
00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.024
- Steady increase.

678
00:34:36.074 --> 00:34:38.651
Normal continuum extraction.
fold attenuating.

679
00:34:38.701 --> 00:34:39.736
- Coolant?

680
00:34:39.786 --> 00:34:41.704
- Natural circulation. nominal flow.

681
00:34:42.622 --> 00:34:44.657
- Why does everyone look so nervous?

682
00:34:44.707 --> 00:34:48.036
- Our SSD was only given short
tests before re-christening.

683
00:34:53.091 --> 00:34:54.842
- Are you nervous?

684
00:34:56.511 --> 00:34:58.179
- Yup.

685
00:35:00.056 --> 00:35:00.965
- 34...

686
00:35:01.015 --> 00:35:01.841
33...

687
00:35:01.891 --> 00:35:02.675

692

697

22...

698
00:35:13.194 --> 00:35:14.270
21...

699
00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.188

10...

707
00:35:25.123 --> 00:35:26.574
- Vents to full open.

708
00:35:29.335 --> 00:35:30.335
5...

709
00:35:30.378 --> 00:35:31.378

1...

713
00:35:34.132 --> 00:35:35.291
Execute!

714
00:35:43.182 --> 00:35:44.675
- SSD is powering down.

715
00:35:44.725 --> 00:35:45.810
All systems nominal.

716
00:35:47.228 --> 00:35:48.763
- Reactors to 75 percent.

717
00:35:48.813 --> 00:35:51.107
- Aye. sir. reactors to 75 percent.

718
00:35:53.526 --> 00:35:55.236
- What went wrong?

719
00:35:56.821 --> 00:35:57.647
- Nothing went wrong.

720
00:35:57.697 --> 00:35:59.232
We're here.

721
00:35:59.282 --> 00:36:00.191
- Then that's it?

722
00:36:00.241 --> 00:36:01.241
- That's it.

723
00:36:03.411 --> 00:36:04.996
- Ugh...!

724
00:36:07.456 --> 00:36:08.699
- That's bizarre.

725
00:36:08.749 --> 00:36:09.867
- You taste copper?

726
00:36:09.917 --> 00:36:12.453
- Yeah. thought I was bleeding.

727
00:36:12.503 --> 00:36:14.413
- Happens to about 10% of people.

728
00:36:14.463 --> 00:36:15.923
It won't hurt you.

729
00:36:17.842 --> 00:36:18.709
Is it time for lunch yet?

730
00:36:18.759 --> 00:36:21.053
I'm starving like an artist.

731
00:36:22.889 --> 00:36:25.049
- You're a dork. sir.

732
00:36:25.099 --> 00:36:27.718
- 190 million miles out of Hiram.

733
00:36:27.768 --> 00:36:31.305
Solid hover. origin point marked.

734
00:36:31.355 --> 00:36:33.900
- All compartments secure
from transition sequence.

735
00:36:35.026 --> 00:36:37.403
No errors.

736
00:36:40.406 --> 00:36:42.650
No errors.

737
00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:45.361
They did her alright after all.

738
00:36:45.411 --> 00:36:48.614
Tom. Go and take the Conn.

739
00:36:48.664 --> 00:36:50.533
plot us a course for mid system.

740
00:36:50.583 --> 00:36:52.368
Let's get hunting.

741
00:36:52.418 --> 00:36:53.828
- Aye aye. Captain.

742
00:36:53.878 --> 00:36:58.040
Helm. come to course 150 by 041.

743
00:36:58.090 --> 00:37:00.042
Roll angle 12 degrees.

744
00:37:00.092 --> 00:37:03.004
Burn ahead one half and hold. 6 hours.

745
00:37:03.054 --> 00:37:06.507
- Aye sir. course 150 by 041.

746
00:37:06.557 --> 00:37:08.259
Roll angle to 12 degrees.

747
00:37:08.309 --> 00:37:09.844
Burn one half for 6 hours.

748
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:14.891
- Never been this far from home.

749
00:37:14.941 --> 00:37:16.893
- Homesick?

750
00:37:16.943 --> 00:37:18.361
- No.

751
00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:01.646
You did EW
in your last assignment?

752
00:38:01.696 --> 00:38:03.856
Just as an assistant but. yeah.

753
00:38:03.906 --> 00:38:05.775
- And their set up was crap.

754
00:38:05.825 --> 00:38:08.402
The captain only got five
keys from the Admiralty

755
00:38:08.452 --> 00:38:11.864
so they had me trying to hack
one ship after the other.

756
00:38:11.914 --> 00:38:14.408
In the end. we would always
just blow down the doors.

757
00:38:14.458 --> 00:38:17.411
That's one thing I will give
to our intrepid captain.

758
00:38:17.461 --> 00:38:19.830
He didn't skimp on that keyring.

759
00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:21.840
- Yeah. how is he supposed
to have all this stuff?

760
00:38:21.882 --> 00:38:25.086
I mean. isn't he supposed
to be low on cash?

761
00:38:25.136 --> 00:38:26.405
- You shouldn't be talking about that.

762
00:38:26.429 --> 00:38:27.255
- Oh. come on. Kai.

763
00:38:27.305 --> 00:38:28.464
You've heard the rumors.

764
00:38:28.514 --> 00:38:31.008
I mean. he went to one of the top schools.

765
00:38:31.058 --> 00:38:32.802
was in one of those clubs.

766
00:38:32.852 --> 00:38:33.678
- Now that's enough.

767
00:38:33.728 --> 00:38:35.846
- It's obvious he's in
bed with high government.

768
00:38:35.896 --> 00:38:38.391
His surname should have
tipped you off on that.

769
00:38:38.441 --> 00:38:40.685
There's no question that IO is involved.

770
00:38:40.735 --> 00:38:42.045
- Why would the Intelligence Office

771
00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:43.813
have anything to do with it?

772
00:38:43.863 --> 00:38:44.605
Beats me.

773
00:38:44.655 --> 00:38:45.898
but who else has the resources

774
00:38:45.948 --> 00:38:47.692
to supply something like this?

775
00:38:47.742 --> 00:38:49.902
I mean did you see those
unmarked ordinance crates

776
00:38:49.952 --> 00:38:51.362
that we took on a few days ago?

777
00:38:51.412 --> 00:38:53.348
I bet you those are some
of those new molten rounds.

778
00:38:53.372 --> 00:38:54.198
- Who told you all of this?

779
00:38:54.248 --> 00:38:56.492
- How about that big red
button up at the fire control?

780
00:38:56.542 --> 00:38:57.622
- Yeah. what is that thing?

781
00:38:57.668 --> 00:38:58.828
- Testudo.

782
00:38:58.878 --> 00:38:59.878
- Tortoise?

783
00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.247
- Tortoise shell.

784
00:39:01.297 --> 00:39:03.124
The outer shake-coat layer of our armor

785
00:39:03.174 --> 00:39:05.376
is nothing unusual for a warship

786
00:39:05.426 --> 00:39:07.003
but they discovered a while ago

787
00:39:07.053 --> 00:39:09.588
that if you run out the
heavy current through it

788
00:39:09.638 --> 00:39:11.465
in these alternating grid patterns

789
00:39:11.515 --> 00:39:14.977
it hardens to something like
20 times its usual strength.

790
00:39:17.772 --> 00:39:19.849
- That's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

791
00:39:19.899 --> 00:39:21.168
You run current through any metal

792
00:39:21.192 --> 00:39:22.310
and all it does is heat up.

793
00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:23.769
It actually weakens it.

794
00:39:23.819 --> 00:39:25.646
Not to mention the scientific fact

795
00:39:25.696 --> 00:39:27.049
that all semiconducting
conducting materials

796
00:39:27.073 --> 00:39:28.232
like our outer armor

797
00:39:28.282 --> 00:39:29.984
actively resist current.

798
00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:32.737
- Not this semiconducting material.

799
00:39:32.787 --> 00:39:34.547
- If you don't know how
it works just say so.

800
00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:36.741
Don't try and make it up.

801
00:39:36.791 --> 00:39:38.743
- Why isn't this standard
across the fleet?

802
00:39:38.793 --> 00:39:40.745
- Because while it sounds great in theory.

803
00:39:40.795 --> 00:39:43.497
in practice the TS burns
through so much power.

804
00:39:43.547 --> 00:39:45.916
our reactors could never hold it constant.

805
00:39:45.966 --> 00:39:47.918
Moreover the alternating grid phases

806
00:39:47.968 --> 00:39:50.254
have this unexplained habit
of trying to flow back

807
00:39:50.304 --> 00:39:51.714
into the transformers.

808
00:39:51.764 --> 00:39:54.050
The systems burn themselves
out within a few seconds

809
00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:57.686
and take everything that
was connected to them.

810
00:39:59.647 --> 00:40:00.431
- That's crazy.

811
00:40:00.481 --> 00:40:01.432
Why would anyone want that?

812
00:40:01.482 --> 00:40:02.767
- Search me.

813
00:40:02.817 --> 00:40:07.063
Who knows what evil lurks in
the mind of inbred aristocrats.

814
00:40:07.113 --> 00:40:09.148
- Now that is enough.

815
00:40:09.198 --> 00:40:11.734
You stop with all this gossip right now.

816
00:40:11.784 --> 00:40:14.403
Quite frankly. it's
unbecoming of officers.

817
00:40:14.453 --> 00:40:16.322
Besides don't you have
something better to do?

818
00:40:16.372 --> 00:40:19.033
- I do now. if that's
gonna be your attitude.

819
00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:21.452
- Wipe the cereal off your
face and get outta of here.

820
00:40:21.502 --> 00:40:22.995
No more of that talk.

821
00:40:23.045 --> 00:40:24.914
I mean it.

822
00:40:25.673 --> 00:40:26.942
And that's
a risky gamble there

823
00:40:26.966 --> 00:40:28.542
but if he can hide the cannon

824
00:40:28.592 --> 00:40:30.378
before the ref gets up
he'll be in the lead!

825
00:40:30.428 --> 00:40:32.280
Red. what do you think of
this move by Pinkerton?

826
00:40:32.304 --> 00:40:34.507
Oh. it's a
failure of diplomacy Ted.

827
00:40:34.557 --> 00:40:37.259
This may be a case of winning
the battle and losing the war.

828
00:40:37.309 --> 00:40:38.928
- This show sucks!

829
00:40:38.978 --> 00:40:39.978
- What are you five?

830
00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:40.805
Shut up.

831
00:40:40.855 --> 00:40:42.306
The grownups are trying to watch.

832
00:40:42.356 --> 00:40:43.599
- At least it's new.

833
00:40:43.649 --> 00:40:45.142
Who's broadcasting this?

834
00:40:45.192 --> 00:40:46.060
- Saint Nishith.

835
00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:48.646
I think they imported it from Puerto Mal

836
00:40:48.696 --> 00:40:50.022
and quit playing with your hair.

837
00:40:50.072 --> 00:40:50.981
Or we'll hold you down again.

838
00:40:51.031 --> 00:40:52.400
shave the rest off.

839
00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:53.776
- What is this?

840
00:40:53.826 --> 00:40:54.985
- Garbage.

841
00:40:55.035 --> 00:40:57.154
How do you have any brain cells left. Eli?

842
00:40:57.204 --> 00:41:00.866
- I keep spares in tiny vials
rolled up with my socks.

843
00:41:07.214 --> 00:41:09.375
- Where did they dig up
these marines. anyway?

844
00:41:09.425 --> 00:41:11.001
- Backside of somewhere.

845
00:41:11.051 --> 00:41:12.711
- How would they not talk to us?

846
00:41:12.761 --> 00:41:13.822
- Why. would you want them to?

847
00:41:13.846 --> 00:41:16.215
- I mean we do share a ship with them.

848
00:41:16.265 --> 00:41:17.425
- So?

849
00:41:17.475 --> 00:41:20.102
They're weirdos. just leave them be.

850
00:41:20.561 --> 00:41:22.054
It's enough to try to do your job

851
00:41:22.104 --> 00:41:23.389
and keep your sanity out here

852
00:41:23.439 --> 00:41:26.684
without some lunatics trying
to raise the dead next door.

853
00:41:26.734 --> 00:41:27.794
- They aren't summoning the dead.

854
00:41:27.818 --> 00:41:29.270
they're sending prayers to the Shah.

855
00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.479
- Oh are they?

856
00:41:30.529 --> 00:41:31.313
And what is a Shah?

857
00:41:31.363 --> 00:41:33.065
- A male peacock.

858
00:41:33.115 --> 00:41:35.067
- He's their king. basically.

859
00:41:35.117 --> 00:41:37.653
Way back when. their Irish
leader started co-opting bits

860
00:41:37.703 --> 00:41:39.864
of Persian and Viking culture.

861
00:41:39.914 --> 00:41:40.739
Then. he convinced them

862
00:41:40.789 --> 00:41:42.700
that all of their prayers flow through him

863
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:44.952
to their respective gods.

864
00:41:45.002 --> 00:41:46.313
It's a good thing they can shoot straight

865
00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:47.830
since they think in pretzels.

866
00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.082
- That sounds like devil worship to me.

867
00:41:50.132 --> 00:41:52.877
Praying to some crazy possessed man.

868
00:41:52.927 --> 00:41:54.670
- Superstitious now?

869
00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:57.214
Gosh sailor. way to beat the stereotype.

870
00:41:57.264 --> 00:42:00.426
- You know. I've seen that medal you have.

871
00:42:00.476 --> 00:42:01.260
You only pull it out

872
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:02.454
when you think no one's looking

873
00:42:02.478 --> 00:42:05.097
but I've seen you staring at that thing.

874
00:42:05.147 --> 00:42:06.599
Almost if you were praying to it.

875
00:42:06.649 --> 00:42:08.934
- It's not religious you moron.

876
00:42:08.984 --> 00:42:10.519
It's just something my mother gave me.

877
00:42:10.569 --> 00:42:12.396
- Oh. good for you.

878
00:42:12.446 --> 00:42:14.523
Go back to your book mama's boy.

879
00:42:14.573 --> 00:42:16.134
Red. what are
you looking forward to?

880
00:42:16.158 --> 00:42:17.651
My son's next birthday.

881
00:42:17.701 --> 00:42:19.111
I bought him a home chemestry set.

882
00:42:19.161 --> 00:42:21.914
panel analyze that. shortly...

883
00:42:21.956 --> 00:42:23.016
- They can't really be trying

884
00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:25.534
to summon demons or something. can they?

885
00:42:25.584 --> 00:42:27.119
Who knows?

886
00:42:27.169 --> 00:42:29.955
Why don't you go ask him
and see what happens?

887
00:42:30.005 --> 00:42:32.249
- I ain't talking to no demon raisers!

888
00:42:32.299 --> 00:42:34.486
...generous grant from
the Elgin Foundation For Preserving

889
00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:36.295
arts and perishable food products.

890
00:42:36.345 --> 00:42:39.640
And in part by donations
from viewers like you.

891
00:42:39.848 --> 00:42:42.551
This show sucks.

892
00:42:52.778 --> 00:42:54.522
Got something?

893
00:42:54.572 --> 00:42:55.689
- Yeah. I think so.

894
00:42:55.739 --> 00:42:57.858
It's unofficial chatter. audio only

895
00:42:57.908 --> 00:42:59.485
but it caught our attention.

896
00:43:03.664 --> 00:43:05.491
- It's gone sir.

897
00:43:15.009 --> 00:43:16.010
- What do you think?

898
00:43:16.885 --> 00:43:19.338
- I think we should tell the captain.

899
00:43:19.388 --> 00:43:20.931
- Good man.

900
00:43:23.392 --> 00:43:25.177
- She's here. gentlemen.

901
00:43:25.227 --> 00:43:28.138
Nursing wounds out beyond
the edge of the system.

902
00:43:28.188 --> 00:43:29.974
- We intercepted comm traffic

903
00:43:30.024 --> 00:43:33.310
that indicates a very
large ship of unknown class

904
00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:35.854
attacked a convoy on its way out system.

905
00:43:35.904 --> 00:43:36.939
Bad luck for them

906
00:43:36.989 --> 00:43:39.984
the convoy came with a
major escort compliment.

907
00:43:40.034 --> 00:43:41.777
Those warships carved her up pretty badly

908
00:43:41.827 --> 00:43:44.913
but they chose not to pursue.

909
00:43:46.665 --> 00:43:50.336
- She finally walked into a
fight she wasn't prepared for.

910
00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:53.914
- We'll resupply

911
00:43:53.964 --> 00:43:56.625
then head out into the empty
on her suspected tangent

912
00:43:56.675 --> 00:43:59.795
We'll sweep outward.
zigzagging on all axes.

913
00:43:59.845 --> 00:44:01.422
Active sweeps at high speed

914
00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:03.632
and we take this one aggressively.

915
00:44:03.682 --> 00:44:05.801
just like the gun-runner.

916
00:44:05.851 --> 00:44:08.053
- It's a good plan.

917
00:44:08.103 --> 00:44:10.439
Looks like your hunch is paying off.

918
00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:14.610
- Dismissed.

919
00:44:43.597 --> 00:44:47.468
After so many
years of disappointments.

920
00:44:47.518 --> 00:44:50.596
I must say that the notion
of feeling genuine pride

921
00:44:50.646 --> 00:44:54.066
for another member of the
family is. well...

922
00:44:54.108 --> 00:44:55.651
alluring.

923
00:44:56.318 --> 00:44:58.896
I won't pretend that I'm
exactly holding my breath.

924
00:44:58.946 --> 00:45:03.909
understand. but it feels good
to be mildly hopeful for once.

925
00:45:04.743 --> 00:45:08.247
You are making a major first step.

926
00:45:09.456 --> 00:45:12.534
Something that your parents.
neither one of them.

927
00:45:12.584 --> 00:45:14.670
could ever bothered to consider...

928
00:45:15.754 --> 00:45:17.873
- You're due in deck in five minutes.

929
00:45:17.923 --> 00:45:19.333
- I know.

930
00:45:19.383 --> 00:45:20.383
- Mother?

931
00:45:21.719 --> 00:45:23.253
- How old do I look to you?

932
00:45:23.303 --> 00:45:24.171
- Aunt?

933
00:45:24.221 --> 00:45:25.221
Grandparent?

934
00:45:27.433 --> 00:45:28.433
Girlfriend?

935
00:45:31.061 --> 00:45:34.314
It's okay. no one's gonna judge!

936
00:45:38.318 --> 00:45:40.354
The closest
we've been able to figure.

937
00:45:40.404 --> 00:45:43.357
this ship is unfeasibly accurate at range

938
00:45:43.407 --> 00:45:47.486
or else has some way of
closing distance fast.

939
00:45:47.536 --> 00:45:50.539
We have a hard time separating
the myth from the fact.

940
00:45:51.415 --> 00:45:53.283
Whatever it is the White Ship is doing.

941
00:45:53.333 --> 00:45:56.120
we're pretty sure it happens fast.

942
00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:59.840
Some of the boxes we found
haven't even logged cries for help.

943
00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:04.128
I don't envy you. and
I don't think your dad

944
00:46:04.178 --> 00:46:06.880
should have encouraged this excursion in...

945
00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:07.930
- Come in.

946
00:46:12.269 --> 00:46:13.353
- Any word from home?

947
00:46:16.356 --> 00:46:18.168
The Port Authority is
demanding a "pass through" fee

948
00:46:18.192 --> 00:46:20.728
for the water. 1200 in Rhodesian Pounds.

949
00:46:20.778 --> 00:46:21.687
- I'll bet.

950
00:46:21.737 --> 00:46:23.397
Go ahead and give it to them.

951
00:46:23.447 --> 00:46:25.816
That will
take us closer to reserve.

952
00:46:25.866 --> 00:46:29.403
- With the prize money coming
in. we should be all right.

953
00:46:29.453 --> 00:46:32.790
By the way. Abner. I've been
going over the crew bios again.

954
00:46:33.665 --> 00:46:35.385
- Did you have a question
about one of them?

955
00:46:35.417 --> 00:46:38.036
- You call Saverin an "evocatus."

956
00:46:38.086 --> 00:46:40.005
Now my Latin is a bit rusty.

957
00:46:41.799 --> 00:46:44.168
but which of the two
empires does he hail from?

958
00:46:44.218 --> 00:46:46.378
- I found him a while
back doing mercenary work.

959
00:46:46.428 --> 00:46:49.389
and he mentioned he did two
tours on a Martellan vessel.

960
00:46:51.058 --> 00:46:53.510
Are you worried about his
credentials or his loyalty?

961
00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:56.305
- I'd like to know how and why he left.

962
00:46:56.355 --> 00:46:57.848
- Ask him.

963
00:46:57.898 --> 00:46:59.099
I didn't.

964
00:46:59.149 --> 00:47:00.768
He's served with me on two ships now.

965
00:47:00.818 --> 00:47:03.237
and always with competence and devotion.

966
00:47:04.321 --> 00:47:06.341
If you had any doubts. you
should have said something

967
00:47:06.365 --> 00:47:07.399
before we left port.

968
00:47:07.449 --> 00:47:09.493
- I don't have doubts. it's just...

969
00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:13.747
Look at who we're docked with.

970
00:47:22.381 --> 00:47:24.025
I'm just a bit worried
that if they see him.

971
00:47:24.049 --> 00:47:25.717
they might try and take him back.

972
00:47:28.262 --> 00:47:29.963
I had hoped that their war wouldn't reach

973
00:47:30.013 --> 00:47:31.673
this close to us though.

974
00:47:31.723 --> 00:47:34.635
- Well. for what it's worth.
I can say with confidence

975
00:47:34.685 --> 00:47:36.804
that Saverin seems to have
lost faith in his homeland

976
00:47:36.854 --> 00:47:41.316
during his second tour. but
he didn't desert or go rogue.

977
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:43.519
He's not a fugitive.

978
00:47:43.569 --> 00:47:45.529
He is just a bit bitter. I think.

979
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:50.692
We'll have no trouble from the
Empires. either one of them.

980
00:47:50.742 --> 00:47:52.119
- Thank God for that.

981
00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:14.091
- 17 hour burn starting now.

982
00:48:14.141 --> 00:48:15.801
Cease burn at 2600 hours.

983
00:48:15.851 --> 00:48:19.229
Helm. roll us left to
three-one-five. maintain vertical.

984
00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:24.309
- Rolling left three-one-five.
maintaining vertical.

985
00:48:24.359 --> 00:48:27.437
- SepMOD. Conn. report all contacts.

986
00:48:27.487 --> 00:48:28.756
Sparse traffic to stern.

987
00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:30.232
all bearings shifting to port.

988
00:48:30.282 --> 00:48:32.651
Two commercial vessels. seven private.

989
00:48:32.701 --> 00:48:34.161
All other tangents empty.

990
00:48:47.132 --> 00:48:48.458
- It's not just about the cash.

991
00:48:48.508 --> 00:48:50.127
it's the whole issue with aristocracy.

992
00:48:50.177 --> 00:48:52.462
the DeVol family may have
helped found the nation.

993
00:48:52.512 --> 00:48:55.090
but that hasn't kept them
from falling out of favor.

994
00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:57.384
They have permanent
governorship over Port Shelley.

995
00:48:57.434 --> 00:49:00.762
but granddad still managed
to screw that one up too.

996
00:49:00.812 --> 00:49:03.974
This whole ship is just
daddy's last ditch effort

997
00:49:04.024 --> 00:49:05.767
to regain relevance.

998
00:49:05.817 --> 00:49:07.152
- What happens if he fails?

999
00:49:08.612 --> 00:49:11.356
- Dissolution of the family
property. basically handing over

1000
00:49:11.406 --> 00:49:13.609
the family name to someone
else in lieu of payment

1001
00:49:13.659 --> 00:49:16.486
and I've even heard talk
of an arranged marriage

1002
00:49:16.536 --> 00:49:19.114
to one of the Arkwright
daughters. could you imagine?

1003
00:49:19.164 --> 00:49:20.490
- What's this?

1004
00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:22.326
- Just a friendly conversation.

1005
00:49:22.376 --> 00:49:23.452
- Right.

1006
00:49:23.502 --> 00:49:24.812
Because who doesn't enjoy gibbering

1007
00:49:24.836 --> 00:49:26.455
with their girlfriend between classes?

1008
00:49:26.505 --> 00:49:28.540
- All right. all right.

1009
00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:31.877
But you have to admit
that he is a little off.

1010
00:49:31.927 --> 00:49:33.545
I mean he acts like a scared ensign.

1011
00:49:33.595 --> 00:49:36.757
- Mr. Royce. I have tolerated
your attitude to this point.

1012
00:49:36.807 --> 00:49:38.717
but you are testing the
limits of my patience.

1013
00:49:38.767 --> 00:49:39.968
- Oh. come on.

1014
00:49:40.018 --> 00:49:42.971
He's got us chasing phantom
ships out here in the empty.

1015
00:49:43.021 --> 00:49:44.348
He's holed up in his cabin.

1016
00:49:44.398 --> 00:49:46.516
I mean he's probably going
pants-crapping insane

1017
00:49:46.566 --> 00:49:48.235
just from the pressure of it all.

1018
00:49:49.778 --> 00:49:51.196
- You wanna repeat that?

1019
00:49:53.991 --> 00:49:56.652
No really. I wanna hear
the in-depth assessment

1020
00:49:56.702 --> 00:49:58.745
from the only actual ensign on board.

1021
00:49:59.621 --> 00:50:00.822
And how far along are you

1022
00:50:00.872 --> 00:50:02.833
with your qualification courses. again?

1023
00:50:03.667 --> 00:50:06.253
Clear off. before I skin you.

1024
00:50:14.386 --> 00:50:16.546
- I loathe children.

1025
00:50:16.596 --> 00:50:19.883
- Look. I know you keep him
on the straight and narrow

1026
00:50:19.933 --> 00:50:23.428
as far as performing his job.
but you have to make sure

1027
00:50:23.478 --> 00:50:26.056
he shows more respect for his Captain.

1028
00:50:26.106 --> 00:50:28.900
no matter what your personal
issues may be with the man.

1029
00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:32.270
- Very well.

1030
00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:34.314
Where did you find him anyway?

1031
00:50:34.364 --> 00:50:36.400
- Loafing around the house.

1032
00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:39.494
But at least my brother
says we're even now.

1033
00:50:44.666 --> 00:50:46.501
Hey Abel. are you awake?

1034
00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:49.420
- Yeah.

1035
00:50:50.505 --> 00:50:51.882
- Why did you come out here?

1036
00:50:54.259 --> 00:50:55.719
- His girlfriend told him to.

1037
00:50:56.678 --> 00:50:59.181
Okay. I'm sure she's worth it.

1038
00:51:00.474 --> 00:51:01.925
- Why do you care?

1039
00:51:01.975 --> 00:51:03.351
- I can't resist a mystery.

1040
00:51:06.063 --> 00:51:07.681
- She's my Great Aunt.

1041
00:51:07.731 --> 00:51:10.225
I knew it!

1042
00:51:10.275 --> 00:51:12.894
Did she knit you a sweater for the trip?

1043
00:51:12.944 --> 00:51:15.605
Offer to come along and rock you to sleep?

1044
00:51:15.655 --> 00:51:17.491
- You'd have to salute her if she did.

1045
00:51:19.451 --> 00:51:21.453
- Wait... AstroNavy?

1046
00:51:23.455 --> 00:51:24.455
An officer?

1047
00:51:25.499 --> 00:51:29.911
- She commanded six ladyships
before she retired. Mustang.

1048
00:51:29.961 --> 00:51:31.880
Worked her way up from the very bottom.

1049
00:51:33.048 --> 00:51:35.300
- Wow. I'm impressed.

1050
00:51:37.677 --> 00:51:41.139
- You know. she has
these aspirations for me

1051
00:51:42.265 --> 00:51:45.635
and she wants me off those
ghetto islands back home.

1052
00:51:45.685 --> 00:51:47.854
Proper citizenship
wouldn't be bad. either.

1053
00:51:50.107 --> 00:51:52.442
- I was thinking the same
thing when Gladys was born.

1054
00:51:53.735 --> 00:51:56.780
I want to make enough to
get her a good education.

1055
00:51:58.782 --> 00:52:00.760
You know she's gonna make it
through Port Shelley some day.

1056
00:52:00.784 --> 00:52:01.985
- Them goals is lofty.

1057
00:52:02.035 --> 00:52:04.946
- Have some kids of your own.
you'll make even higher ones.

1058
00:52:04.996 --> 00:52:06.323
- I'm okay with what I have.

1059
00:52:06.373 --> 00:52:08.825
- Yeah. a tough life.
banging on one cylinder.

1060
00:52:08.875 --> 00:52:10.127
- Shut up. Dimitri.

1061
00:52:11.211 --> 00:52:15.582
- So... you don't have
any kids. then. Abel?

1062
00:52:15.632 --> 00:52:17.425
No.

1063
00:52:27.644 --> 00:52:30.097
What do you think we're
doing out here anyway?

1064
00:52:30.147 --> 00:52:31.189
Out in the black?

1065
00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:33.440
- Why?

1066
00:52:34.442 --> 00:52:35.268
You worried or something?

1067
00:52:35.318 --> 00:52:36.318
- No.

1068
00:52:37.612 --> 00:52:41.241
Well. yeah. maybe a little.

1069
00:52:43.326 --> 00:52:45.403
- There's nothing to worry about.

1070
00:52:45.453 --> 00:52:47.280
Just empty space.

1071
00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:49.457
- But that's just it. I mean...

1072
00:52:50.375 --> 00:52:53.545
anything could be out here.

1073
00:52:57.841 --> 00:52:59.551
- There's nothing out here.

1074
00:53:06.308 --> 00:53:07.092
- The men are starting to wonder

1075
00:53:07.142 --> 00:53:09.177
what we're doing out here.

1076
00:53:09.227 --> 00:53:10.705
- I'm beginning to wonder that myself.

1077
00:53:10.729 --> 00:53:13.765
- Well. a little reflection
is good for a captain.

1078
00:53:13.815 --> 00:53:17.352
But I hesitate
to turn back as well.

1079
00:53:17.402 --> 00:53:18.671
The admiralty will be expecting to hear

1080
00:53:18.695 --> 00:53:19.839
back from us in a couple of days.

1081
00:53:19.863 --> 00:53:22.524
- Don't make that the
decision point though.

1082
00:53:22.574 --> 00:53:23.817
With ships this far out.

1083
00:53:23.867 --> 00:53:25.777
those deadlines are pretty flexible.

1084
00:53:25.827 --> 00:53:27.612
- Well. we have been
out here for some time.

1085
00:53:27.662 --> 00:53:28.613
and at some point.

1086
00:53:28.663 --> 00:53:30.490
we're gonna have to turn back.

1087
00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:32.500
It's up to you when.

1088
00:53:34.753 --> 00:53:36.872
- But to turn back empty handed?

1089
00:53:36.922 --> 00:53:38.874
That doesn't
mean that we're giving up.

1090
00:53:38.924 --> 00:53:41.084
We could still replenish
and resume the hunt.

1091
00:53:41.134 --> 00:53:43.628
- Not if somebody finds her first.

1092
00:53:43.678 --> 00:53:46.840
we might return home.
and find out that there's

1093
00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:48.675
nothing left. that it's all done.

1094
00:53:48.725 --> 00:53:49.968
there's nothing left to resume.

1095
00:53:50.018 --> 00:53:51.720
- Don't be like that. Marcus.

1096
00:53:51.770 --> 00:53:54.139
- That's the dirty little secret here.

1097
00:53:54.189 --> 00:53:55.416
It was never gonna be enough to

1098
00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:57.058
hunt down pirates and collect bounties.

1099
00:53:57.108 --> 00:54:00.520
without the White Ship.
Dad and I are finished.

1100
00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:03.481
The long line of DeVols. ever since Uriah.

1101
00:54:03.531 --> 00:54:05.634
will just be snuffed out.
It's a fine irony.

1102
00:54:05.825 --> 00:54:08.862
He founded a country where
the most successful man rules.

1103
00:54:08.912 --> 00:54:10.697
gives the Chairmanship to his son.

1104
00:54:10.747 --> 00:54:13.667
and the idiot loses it immediately.

1105
00:54:15.335 --> 00:54:17.746
And the rest of us have just been
spiraling downward since.

1106
00:54:17.796 --> 00:54:20.999
- Technically. Uriah founded
a communications company.

1107
00:54:21.049 --> 00:54:22.485
It just happened to grow rich enough.

1108
00:54:22.509 --> 00:54:24.127
that it was able to be nationalized.

1109
00:54:24.177 --> 00:54:25.545
- Thank you. Abner.

1110
00:54:25.595 --> 00:54:27.255
I'm well aware of my family history.

1111
00:54:27.305 --> 00:54:30.550
I heard it every day
while I was in school.

1112
00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:32.719
"Your family screws up so bad.

1113
00:54:32.769 --> 00:54:34.409
that we're going to give them the one job

1114
00:54:34.437 --> 00:54:37.724
that nobody can actually lose:"

1115
00:54:37.774 --> 00:54:39.476
Port Shelley.

1116
00:54:39.526 --> 00:54:42.437
What happened to
you in school is irrelevant.

1117
00:54:42.487 --> 00:54:44.197
You're here now. you're the commander.

1118
00:54:45.365 --> 00:54:47.192
Teenage bullies have no bearing on your

1119
00:54:47.242 --> 00:54:48.443
responsibility to your crew

1120
00:54:48.493 --> 00:54:51.621
or your family back home.
- Do not lecture me. Abner.

1121
00:54:51.788 --> 00:54:54.699
My experience has everything
to do with who I am...

1122
00:54:54.749 --> 00:54:58.036
- Oh no. no. no. we're not gonna
do this self pitying. woe is me...

1123
00:54:58.086 --> 00:54:59.788
- I am not... I'm not self-pitying!

1124
00:54:59.838 --> 00:55:01.798
- Oh yes. you are!

1125
00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:04.417
Did you think this was gonna be easy?

1126
00:55:04.467 --> 00:55:08.255
This is the real world of
combat. war. and death.

1127
00:55:08.305 --> 00:55:10.090
Thank whatever it is that you pray to

1128
00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:12.259
that you haven't directly
seen the death yet.

1129
00:55:12.309 --> 00:55:12.976
- Abner!

1130
00:55:13.018 --> 00:55:14.844
- You're leading a crew of men!

1131
00:55:14.894 --> 00:55:17.722
And they need a man to lead them.

1132
00:55:17.772 --> 00:55:19.432
Are you just gonna mope around because

1133
00:55:19.482 --> 00:55:21.726
your first stab at a tough mission.

1134
00:55:21.776 --> 00:55:23.528
is coming up empty?

1135
00:55:24.821 --> 00:55:26.406
Grow up. Marcus.

1136
00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:28.491
Right now.

1137
00:55:43.214 --> 00:55:46.251
- 1700 hours. cruising as before.

1138
00:55:46.301 --> 00:55:48.044
1700 hours.

1139
00:55:48.094 --> 00:55:50.797
cruising as before. so noted.

1140
00:55:50.847 --> 00:55:53.600
- SepMOD. Conn. report all contacts.

1141
00:55:56.603 --> 00:55:57.929
No contacts. sir.

1142
00:55:57.979 --> 00:55:59.481
All scopes clear.

1143
00:56:00.648 --> 00:56:02.142
- What's our heading?

1144
00:56:02.192 --> 00:56:05.111
100 by 385.

1145
00:56:06.654 --> 00:56:08.356
- Burn to full stop.

1146
00:56:08.406 --> 00:56:11.368
steer to 010 and resume speed.

1147
00:56:12.327 --> 00:56:14.738
- Full stop. steer 010.

1148
00:56:14.788 --> 00:56:16.281
and resume speed. aye. sir.

1149
00:56:18.833 --> 00:56:20.285
- Gary. take the Conn.

1150
00:57:23.565 --> 00:57:25.892
We are really out there now.

1151
00:57:25.942 --> 00:57:28.945
back to the onboard library... whoa. wait.

1152
00:57:31.614 --> 00:57:32.907
Just a glitch.

1153
00:57:33.908 --> 00:57:35.819
Ghost in the machine.

1154
00:57:35.869 --> 00:57:38.738
- Do we really have to
bring ghosts into this?

1155
00:57:38.788 --> 00:57:40.266
We don't have to. I just meant that...

1156
00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:42.158
Then don't. okay.

1157
00:57:42.208 --> 00:57:43.960
Just. just...

1158
00:57:46.045 --> 00:57:47.045
Just don't.

1159
00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:49.192
- I don't believe it...

1160
00:58:50.610 --> 00:58:52.145
Captain to SepMOD!

1161
00:58:52.195 --> 00:58:53.446
Captain to SepMOD!

1162
00:58:58.993 --> 00:59:00.578
I don't believe it.

1163
00:59:02.288 --> 00:59:03.408
What is she doing?

1164
00:59:03.456 --> 00:59:05.116
She's not doing anything.

1165
00:59:05.166 --> 00:59:06.826
Emissions? Broadcasts?

1166
00:59:06.876 --> 00:59:09.829
None. either she's
got fantastic shielding.

1167
00:59:09.879 --> 00:59:12.123
or her reactor's cold.

1168
00:59:12.173 --> 00:59:13.666
- Dead in the water?

1169
00:59:13.716 --> 00:59:15.543
- No. she'd be drifting if there

1170
00:59:15.593 --> 00:59:17.003
was a sudden power loss.

1171
00:59:17.053 --> 00:59:18.421
- Maybe she hopped?

1172
00:59:18.471 --> 00:59:19.714
And we just happened on her

1173
00:59:19.764 --> 00:59:20.783
before she could get up and running?

1174
00:59:20.807 --> 00:59:23.343
- There should still be something.

1175
00:59:23.393 --> 00:59:24.453
- It has to be the White Ship.

1176
00:59:24.477 --> 00:59:26.554
I mean. look at the size of her!

1177
00:59:26.604 --> 00:59:27.722
In this part of the void.

1178
00:59:27.772 --> 00:59:29.166
there can't be more than a couple of ships

1179
00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:31.476
that big and running around.

1180
00:59:31.526 --> 00:59:33.394
- Foley. what is she?

1181
00:59:33.444 --> 00:59:36.147
- I don't know. captain.

1182
00:59:36.197 --> 00:59:37.357
The computer is calling it a

1183
00:59:37.407 --> 00:59:38.858
civilian Ontos Cruiser.

1184
00:59:38.908 --> 00:59:41.319
but the silhouette's all wrong.

1185
00:59:41.369 --> 00:59:43.162
Whatever this is.

1186
00:59:44.122 --> 00:59:45.949
I don't think it's in our databases.

1187
00:59:45.999 --> 00:59:48.001
- It's her. it's gotta be!

1188
00:59:49.252 --> 00:59:50.837
Captain?

1189
01:00:01.931 --> 01:00:04.092
- Come on. Marcus. let's go get her!

1190
01:00:04.142 --> 01:00:06.370
- Tom. so help me...
- Enough with the formalities. Marcus.

1191
01:00:06.394 --> 01:00:07.804
This is me that you're talking to.

1192
01:00:07.854 --> 01:00:09.973
and this is exactly

1193
01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:12.108
what we've been working towards.

1194
01:00:13.943 --> 01:00:15.320
- Unless it's a trap.

1195
01:00:16.529 --> 01:00:19.315
- Unless it's a trap for who exactly?

1196
01:00:19.365 --> 01:00:21.943
Look. if she starts
twitching when we get close.

1197
01:00:21.993 --> 01:00:23.987
we can easily pull away with

1198
01:00:24.037 --> 01:00:26.205
just scratches. Marcus.

1199
01:00:27.206 --> 01:00:29.534
We ignore this. and we're missing

1200
01:00:29.584 --> 01:00:32.420
the opportunity of a lifetime.

1201
01:00:43.431 --> 01:00:45.800
- Okay. we'll get in closer.

1202
01:00:45.850 --> 01:00:47.135
and evaluate her condition.

1203
01:00:47.185 --> 01:00:48.728
- Yes. sir!

1204
01:00:52.649 --> 01:00:54.142
We're going in to get her.

1205
01:00:54.192 --> 01:00:55.643
I have the Conn.

1206
01:00:55.693 --> 01:00:57.111
Roll starboard 10 degrees.

1207
01:00:58.071 --> 01:00:59.197
Stern up 49.

1208
01:01:00.156 --> 01:01:01.733
10 tips to Port by the bow.

1209
01:01:01.783 --> 01:01:02.567
- Aye. sir.

1210
01:01:02.617 --> 01:01:05.278
- Burn ahead one quarter. 60 seconds.

1211
01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:07.205
- I have the Conn. threat board on two.

1212
01:01:21.928 --> 01:01:23.046
- Captain?

1213
01:01:23.096 --> 01:01:25.048
- SepMOD. what's her bearing?

1214
01:01:25.098 --> 01:01:27.642
304 by 355 relative.

1215
01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:31.471
- Helm. adjust our approach.

1216
01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:32.689
Bring us up on her beam.

1217
01:01:33.815 --> 01:01:35.024
- Adjusting. aye. sir.

1218
01:01:37.276 --> 01:01:38.444
- Captain?

1219
01:01:40.029 --> 01:01:41.114
Yes.

1220
01:01:42.824 --> 01:01:44.367
- May I recommend we hail them?

1221
01:01:45.743 --> 01:01:48.162
- No. radio silence for the time being.

1222
01:01:51.207 --> 01:01:52.625
- Shall we go to quarters?

1223
01:01:57.130 --> 01:01:58.297
- Go to quarters.

1224
01:01:59.424 --> 01:02:00.693
- General quarters. general quarters.

1225
01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:02.085
all hands to battle stations!

1226
01:02:16.899 --> 01:02:18.401
- Ship is at quarters.

1227
01:02:21.529 --> 01:02:25.158
- Chief. bring up the external
on three. Extreme telephoto.

1228
01:02:28.453 --> 01:02:29.829
Light her up.

1229
01:02:34.876 --> 01:02:36.127
Closer.

1230
01:02:49.807 --> 01:02:51.184
- She's huge.

1231
01:02:51.726 --> 01:02:54.429
- SepMOD. do you have a
classification on the target?

1232
01:02:54.479 --> 01:02:56.606
The computer's
still stumbling on it.

1233
01:02:58.733 --> 01:03:01.018
Now it says it could be
a McClarren gray ship.

1234
01:03:01.068 --> 01:03:02.236
- Is it?

1235
01:03:03.196 --> 01:03:04.397
No chance. Captain.

1236
01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:05.398
- Helm. back one quarter.

1237
01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:07.283
Let's not get too close yet.

1238
01:03:11.370 --> 01:03:13.331
She looks derelict.

1239
01:03:13.831 --> 01:03:16.325
- Not necessarily.

1240
01:03:16.375 --> 01:03:17.910
Look at that darkening aft.

1241
01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:20.621
She's taken a couple of serious hits.

1242
01:03:20.671 --> 01:03:23.040
That could be a breach.

1243
01:03:23.090 --> 01:03:25.585
- The airlock looks warped on this side.

1244
01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:26.945
We'd have to approach from the other.

1245
01:03:26.969 --> 01:03:28.846
where she could have taken less damage.

1246
01:04:16.769 --> 01:04:17.769
Gary?

1247
01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:21.524
- Some variant on the Viper III mount.

1248
01:04:22.483 --> 01:04:23.601
They're very accurate.

1249
01:04:23.651 --> 01:04:25.128
but the magazines are kept inside the hull

1250
01:04:25.152 --> 01:04:26.604
and the barrels have to be rotated

1251
01:04:26.654 --> 01:04:27.939
perpendicular to the spine

1252
01:04:27.989 --> 01:04:30.241
to line up the feed
slots between every shot.

1253
01:04:31.617 --> 01:04:33.778
Not very good at close quarters.

1254
01:04:33.828 --> 01:04:37.081
- Have the crews of Hydra 1
and Quad mount load specials.

1255
01:04:41.836 --> 01:04:43.788
- Aye. sir.

1256
01:04:43.838 --> 01:04:45.998
Quad mount and Hydra 1.

1257
01:04:46.048 --> 01:04:46.833
- All right.

1258
01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:47.901
Load the specials.

1259
01:04:47.925 --> 01:04:50.711
- Helm. bring us alongside her.

1260
01:04:50.761 --> 01:04:52.505
We'll prepare a boarding action.

1261
01:04:52.555 --> 01:04:53.840
Bring us alongside.

1262
01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:55.258
Aye Sir.

1263
01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:17.446
- Closing at 10 feet per second.

1264
01:05:17.496 --> 01:05:18.581
Coming about.

1265
01:05:22.168 --> 01:05:23.628
- Guns at the ready?

1266
01:05:26.631 --> 01:05:29.000
Contact one
thousand yards and closing.

1267
01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:30.718
Devil's Distance captain.

1268
01:05:32.219 --> 01:05:33.739
- If they were gonna give us any trouble.

1269
01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:35.882
they would have done it by now.

1270
01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:38.851
- Does anybody see any white paint?

1271
01:05:42.855 --> 01:05:44.307
- Maybe they...

1272
01:05:44.357 --> 01:05:45.650
repainted.

1273
01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:50.321
- Let's get a close-up of the bow.

1274
01:05:54.408 --> 01:05:55.910
- That's not recent.

1275
01:05:56.953 --> 01:05:58.988
That's old damage.

1276
01:05:59.038 --> 01:06:00.665
- What's it say?

1277
01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:05.044
- Voltairine?

1278
01:06:06.545 --> 01:06:08.497
- That's not right.

1279
01:06:08.547 --> 01:06:10.541
This isn't right.

1280
01:06:10.591 --> 01:06:12.176
- Go wide again.

1281
01:06:15.054 --> 01:06:16.255
- Chief!

1282
01:06:16.305 --> 01:06:17.574
Lost the input signal. sir.

1283
01:06:17.598 --> 01:06:18.883
Recycling it again.

1284
01:06:20.142 --> 01:06:20.927
- Whoa.

1285
01:06:22.561 --> 01:06:23.771
- What?

1286
01:06:25.439 --> 01:06:27.183
- Chief! What's going on?

1287
01:06:27.233 --> 01:06:28.059
Sir?

1288
01:06:28.109 --> 01:06:29.393
- Chief. what's going on?

1289
01:06:29.443 --> 01:06:31.270
- Guidance thrusters not responding.

1290
01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.188
- What?

1291
01:06:32.238 --> 01:06:34.065
- I have no control.

1292
01:06:48.129 --> 01:06:48.913
- Royce!

1293
01:06:48.963 --> 01:06:51.207
- Nothing's working. nothing's working!

1294
01:06:51.257 --> 01:06:52.291
- Did they infiltrate us?

1295
01:06:52.341 --> 01:06:55.836
- They can't have. there was
no signal. no transmission.

1296
01:06:55.886 --> 01:06:56.905
- Gun crews are all reporting

1297
01:06:56.929 --> 01:06:58.073
their controls won't respond.

1298
01:07:04.228 --> 01:07:06.389
- They've set us adrift.

1299
01:07:06.439 --> 01:07:07.791
Royce. you have to clean them out!

1300
01:07:07.815 --> 01:07:09.642
- I don't. I'm trying Captain.

1301
01:07:09.692 --> 01:07:11.686
- Not good enough. make it happen.

1302
01:07:11.736 --> 01:07:12.603
- I. I can't!

1303
01:07:12.653 --> 01:07:13.437
- You have to.

1304
01:07:13.487 --> 01:07:14.605
- Marcus!

1305
01:07:14.655 --> 01:07:15.606
Marcus!

1306
01:07:21.328 --> 01:07:23.447
- All engines ahead flank! AHEAD FLANK!

1307
01:07:23.497 --> 01:07:24.782
- I have no control!

1308
01:07:25.666 --> 01:07:26.450
- Gary!

1309
01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:29.453
- Do it!

1310
01:07:43.267 --> 01:07:44.885
- We're rolling to port!

1311
01:07:44.935 --> 01:07:46.303
- Fire control's back on line!

1312
01:07:46.353 --> 01:07:48.347
The shock must have tripped something!

1313
01:07:48.397 --> 01:07:49.265
- Helm. all ahead flank!

1314
01:07:49.315 --> 01:07:51.100
- Helm still isn't answering Sir!

1315
01:07:51.984 --> 01:07:53.336
Hydra Twin out of action!

1316
01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:55.104
- Quad mount also out of action!

1317
01:07:55.154 --> 01:07:55.938
- Hydra 1...

1318
01:07:55.988 --> 01:07:56.772
- She is not responding. sir!

1319
01:07:56.822 --> 01:07:57.966
The targeting system's damaged.

1320
01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:59.483
- Fire with any working gun we have!

1321
01:07:59.533 --> 01:08:01.277
Patch me through to the crew of Hydra 1.

1322
01:08:01.327 --> 01:08:02.862
- Ed. patch him in! Cobra and Hydra 2.

1323
01:08:02.912 --> 01:08:05.656
rotate 090 relative and bottom out!

1324
01:08:05.706 --> 01:08:06.808
We'll hit her as we come around!

1325
01:08:06.832 --> 01:08:08.159
- Ugh!

1326
01:08:08.209 --> 01:08:10.077
- Gary. I'm gonna give
the crew a Hydra 1 to

1327
01:08:10.127 --> 01:08:11.328
make a manual shot!

1328
01:08:11.378 --> 01:08:12.830
- Aye captain. Hydra 2 and Cobra

1329
01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:15.332
target the damaged section on
her stern as we come around.

1330
01:08:15.382 --> 01:08:17.027
- Royce can we do anything
about our targeting system?

1331
01:08:17.051 --> 01:08:18.169
- I can't get any readings.

1332
01:08:18.219 --> 01:08:19.879
It's like there's nothing there to spoof.

1333
01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:21.297
- Hit the button again.

1334
01:08:21.347 --> 01:08:22.631
Now!

1335
01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:35.319
- Hydra 2 coming around.

1336
01:08:38.364 --> 01:08:39.190
Firing!

1337
01:08:40.616 --> 01:08:42.276
We missed!

1338
01:08:42.326 --> 01:08:43.611
- Cobra. you're up!

1339
01:08:43.661 --> 01:08:44.820
- Yes sir!

1340
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:46.822
- Royce. hold that button down.

1341
01:08:46.872 --> 01:08:48.741
Hold it down I said!

1342
01:08:50.376 --> 01:08:51.786
- Hydra 1. prepare to fire.

1343
01:09:03.389 --> 01:09:05.549
- Sir. I've got burnouts
all across the board.

1344
01:09:05.599 --> 01:09:07.593
Something's drawing too much power!

1345
01:09:07.643 --> 01:09:09.678
- Safety override. Reactors to 150.

1346
01:09:09.728 --> 01:09:11.847
Pull the stops. Now!

1347
01:09:14.441 --> 01:09:15.392
- Steady now.

1348
01:09:15.442 --> 01:09:16.644
- We got this.

1349
01:09:32.293 --> 01:09:34.036
Fire! Tear me a hole right through her!

1350
01:09:34.086 --> 01:09:35.371
Firing!

1351
01:09:38.299 --> 01:09:39.466
- Hydra 1...

1352
01:09:40.384 --> 01:09:41.510
Fire!

1353
01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:12.809
And we've done it again!

1354
01:10:12.833 --> 01:10:15.119
Shut her off!

1355
01:10:19.006 --> 01:10:22.551
Conn. target has
broken into two pieces.

1356
01:10:23.427 --> 01:10:25.880
Both are drifting away from us.

1357
01:10:30.434 --> 01:10:31.894
- Reactor status.

1358
01:10:33.187 --> 01:10:35.514
- Reactors are holding stable.

1359
01:10:35.564 --> 01:10:37.266
- We're all right.

1360
01:10:37.316 --> 01:10:38.601
We're okay.

1361
01:10:38.651 --> 01:10:40.269
- Alive. at any rate.

1362
01:10:40.319 --> 01:10:41.562
Check for damage.

1363
01:10:41.612 --> 01:10:42.688
- Aye sir.

1364
01:10:44.907 --> 01:10:47.651
Looks like the fat lady called it a day.

1365
01:10:47.701 --> 01:10:50.571
- You're a dork Salles.

1366
01:10:55.334 --> 01:10:56.627
- Are you all right captain?

1367
01:10:57.586 --> 01:10:59.830
Can you receive a damage report?

1368
01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:01.340
- Kill the alarm.

1369
01:11:02.424 --> 01:11:05.135
All compartments. report damage to LSO.

1370
01:11:09.473 --> 01:11:11.675
We shouldn't have been
able to survive that.

1371
01:11:11.725 --> 01:11:13.802
- No. we shouldn't.

1372
01:11:13.852 --> 01:11:16.055
It was Royce on the MFC.

1373
01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:18.015
Without the Testudo we'd
have had hull breaches

1374
01:11:18.065 --> 01:11:19.775
with the first hits.

1375
01:11:21.944 --> 01:11:25.272
His presence of mind just
saved all of our lives.

1376
01:11:25.322 --> 01:11:28.325
And without his quick thinking.
we'd all be finished...

1377
01:11:32.454 --> 01:11:35.374
The pressure
doors are still open!

1378
01:11:40.713 --> 01:11:43.340
- I need to see how much of
my ship is still working.

1379
01:12:18.292 --> 01:12:19.952
Hull breach.

1380
01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:22.296
Hull breach. Hull breach.

1381
01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:24.748
Releasing sealing agent.

1382
01:12:28.677 --> 01:12:30.504
Hull breach.

1383
01:12:30.554 --> 01:12:32.181
Sealing pressure doors.

1384
01:12:33.891 --> 01:12:35.217
- What is going on?

1385
01:12:35.267 --> 01:12:36.885
What is happening to my ship?

1386
01:12:36.935 --> 01:12:38.204
- We're breached aft in engineering.

1387
01:12:38.228 --> 01:12:40.180
They've been sealed off.

1388
01:12:40.230 --> 01:12:41.249
- Ventilate them. They need air!

1389
01:12:41.273 --> 01:12:43.460
- Captain. the back pressure
will bleed the entire system.

1390
01:12:43.484 --> 01:12:44.893
We'll all depressurize!

1391
01:12:44.943 --> 01:12:46.478
- Use O2 tank 3!

1392
01:12:46.528 --> 01:12:48.548
Dump the entire thing into
the chamber of wholesale.

1393
01:12:48.572 --> 01:12:49.815
Come on!

1394
01:12:49.865 --> 01:12:51.200
- Sven!

1395
01:12:52.284 --> 01:12:53.410
Sve...

1396
01:12:55.496 --> 01:12:57.114
SCRAM the reactor!

1397
01:12:57.164 --> 01:12:58.374
SCRA...

1398
01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:00.909
- Salles!

1399
01:13:00.959 --> 01:13:02.661
The breach will be sealed in a moment.

1400
01:13:10.969 --> 01:13:12.838
- Fire in engineering!

1401
01:13:14.348 --> 01:13:16.392
- Belay oxygen. Release CO2.

1402
01:13:20.729 --> 01:13:22.639
- It's not releasing.

1403
01:13:27.861 --> 01:13:29.980
Hull breach sealed.

1404
01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:30.814
- Salles!

1405
01:13:33.575 --> 01:13:36.820
I need you to get on the CO2.

1406
01:13:48.882 --> 01:13:49.925
- Go!

1407
01:13:55.931 --> 01:13:57.933
- Is there anything else that we can do?

1408
01:13:58.809 --> 01:14:00.677
- Nothing.

1409
01:14:00.727 --> 01:14:03.305
If they can't get that fire out.

1410
01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:26.912
Reactor SCRAM.

1411
01:14:26.962 --> 01:14:28.130
Reactor SCRAM.

1412
01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:33.585
Reactor SCRAM.

1413
01:15:16.595 --> 01:15:18.338
We're on auxiliary power.

1414
01:15:18.388 --> 01:15:19.756
I think the fire is out. captain.

1415
01:15:19.806 --> 01:15:21.308
- Release the oxygen!

1416
01:15:33.570 --> 01:15:35.189
- Salles. you all right?

1417
01:15:35.239 --> 01:15:37.157
Come on. you all right?

1418
01:15:38.742 --> 01:15:39.910
Its all right.

1419
01:15:41.787 --> 01:15:42.988
- Talk to me. Come on.

1420
01:15:43.038 --> 01:15:43.822
- I have to help.

1421
01:15:43.872 --> 01:15:45.666
- No! No! There's nothing you can do!

1422
01:15:45.958 --> 01:15:47.292
Let me go!

1423
01:15:56.927 --> 01:15:58.345
- It's all right.

1424
01:15:59.346 --> 01:16:00.346
Easy.

1425
01:16:01.306 --> 01:16:03.300
- He's sleeping.

1426
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:04.518
- Yeah.

1427
01:16:06.436 --> 01:16:09.606
- He's... he's sleeping...

1428
01:16:27.624 --> 01:16:30.919
The hull breach
is temporarily patched.

1429
01:16:31.837 --> 01:16:32.996
but we need a drydock before

1430
01:16:33.046 --> 01:16:35.007
we can reasonably go into combat again.

1431
01:16:35.591 --> 01:16:37.709
All five rail gun mounts are nonresponsive

1432
01:16:37.759 --> 01:16:39.344
since that last hit.

1433
01:16:40.846 --> 01:16:42.965
Auxiliary fuel tanks are destroyed.

1434
01:16:43.015 --> 01:16:44.474
That's what started the fire.

1435
01:16:46.351 --> 01:16:48.512
We're running in limited
capacity on battery backup.

1436
01:16:48.562 --> 01:16:49.638
which...

1437
01:16:49.688 --> 01:16:51.390
- Won't give us enough power to maneuver.

1438
01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:53.141
Move on.

1439
01:16:53.191 --> 01:16:55.435
11 men are dead. 15 wounded.

1440
01:16:55.485 --> 01:16:57.771
and only three of the
engine crew survived.

1441
01:16:57.821 --> 01:17:00.816
All the computers crashed in
the switchover to battery.

1442
01:17:00.866 --> 01:17:02.218
Some of the systems have re-booted.

1443
01:17:02.242 --> 01:17:04.152
but others are just gone.

1444
01:17:04.202 --> 01:17:06.389
The good news is whatever got
into our thruster control.

1445
01:17:06.413 --> 01:17:09.249
seems to have been flushed
out by the system crash.

1446
01:17:15.589 --> 01:17:16.590
- Okay.

1447
01:17:18.675 --> 01:17:19.926
Tell me bad part.

1448
01:17:21.011 --> 01:17:23.255
- The SSD has taken significant damage

1449
01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:27.551
and. Tamai's obviously not up
to repairing or operating it.

1450
01:17:27.601 --> 01:17:28.601
And no one else on board

1451
01:17:28.644 --> 01:17:30.604
has his knowledge or experience.

1452
01:17:32.648 --> 01:17:34.149
- We can't go home.

1453
01:17:36.276 --> 01:17:37.311
This is a disaster.

1454
01:17:37.361 --> 01:17:38.145
- Marcus.

1455
01:17:38.195 --> 01:17:39.563
- It wasn't even the right ship!

1456
01:17:39.613 --> 01:17:41.573
- You should be proud of your crew sir.

1457
01:17:42.407 --> 01:17:43.609
Whoever the Voltairine was.

1458
01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:44.886
she would have preyed on others.

1459
01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:46.653
possibly our allies.

1460
01:17:46.703 --> 01:17:49.623
We lost some good men but that
happens in this profession.

1461
01:17:50.582 --> 01:17:51.582
Sir...

1462
01:17:53.794 --> 01:17:55.379
you should be proud of them all.

1463
01:18:00.133 --> 01:18:03.261
- I suppose we've done
our part in this search.

1464
01:18:08.433 --> 01:18:10.260
Reactor is critical.

1465
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:12.387
Reactor is critical.

1466
01:18:12.437 --> 01:18:15.607
All engines ready to.
begin standard maneuvers.

1467
01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:18.602
- There's the real good news.

1468
01:18:18.652 --> 01:18:20.395
The reactor was somehow undamaged.

1469
01:18:20.445 --> 01:18:21.839
It looks like our surviving crew members

1470
01:18:21.863 --> 01:18:23.615
were able to get it up and running.

1471
01:18:26.284 --> 01:18:27.703
Will you take the Conn?

1472
01:18:35.335 --> 01:18:37.254
- Give me five minutes.

1473
01:18:45.178 --> 01:18:46.588
- How about you Tom?

1474
01:18:46.638 --> 01:18:47.973
Are you holding up?

1475
01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:51.309
- Oh yes! I'm just fine!

1476
01:18:52.769 --> 01:18:55.347
You're right. This is a disaster.

1477
01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:56.640
It's my disaster.

1478
01:18:56.690 --> 01:18:57.474
- Oh. knock it off!

1479
01:18:57.524 --> 01:18:58.668
- I just thought that you should make

1480
01:18:58.692 --> 01:19:00.686
a real decision for once!

1481
01:19:00.736 --> 01:19:02.437
- And I did.

1482
01:19:02.487 --> 01:19:04.114
And I have to live with it.

1483
01:19:05.198 --> 01:19:06.450
You don't.

1484
01:19:11.788 --> 01:19:14.207
Pull yourself together and have a drink.

1485
01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:34.352
- How about the navigation systems?

1486
01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:37.189
- What? Oh.

1487
01:19:38.231 --> 01:19:39.691
Completely dead.

1488
01:19:40.692 --> 01:19:42.486
I can still do manual plots.

1489
01:19:43.904 --> 01:19:45.313
I'll get us into port.

1490
01:19:45.363 --> 01:19:47.616
- You'll have to get us home after that.

1491
01:19:50.243 --> 01:19:54.281
- You want me to calculate
a transition. by hand.

1492
01:19:54.331 --> 01:19:57.367
- Proper help is unlikely to
present itself at St. Nishith.

1493
01:19:57.417 --> 01:19:59.786
Equipment to repair the drive. maybe.

1494
01:19:59.836 --> 01:20:01.913
but personnel. I think not.

1495
01:20:01.963 --> 01:20:04.249
- But I barely even
scrapped those classes.

1496
01:20:04.299 --> 01:20:06.042
And without Dennis here to run the drive.

1497
01:20:06.092 --> 01:20:07.627
If we can even get It fixed...

1498
01:20:07.677 --> 01:20:09.797
- Then you'd better break
out the displacement manual.

1499
01:20:09.846 --> 01:20:12.090
Work with Gary on this.

1500
01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:13.008
We're gonna need a second

1501
01:20:13.058 --> 01:20:15.427
just in case something happens to you.

1502
01:20:15.477 --> 01:20:16.803
Not Gary. Kai.

1503
01:20:16.853 --> 01:20:19.356
Gary will be busy unsticking the guns.

1504
01:20:22.526 --> 01:20:25.812
It'll be at least two weeks
until we reach The Fell.

1505
01:20:25.862 --> 01:20:27.689
Just long enough. to get used to the idea

1506
01:20:27.739 --> 01:20:29.191
of becoming an Arkwright.

1507
01:20:29.241 --> 01:20:30.025
- Marcus.

1508
01:20:30.075 --> 01:20:30.859
- Don't call me Marcus.

1509
01:20:30.909 --> 01:20:32.661
Get on it right away.

1510
01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:03.775
- Your orders. captain?

1511
01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:14.661
- Helm.

1512
01:21:15.704 --> 01:21:17.372
come to course 185.

1513
01:21:18.373 --> 01:21:20.325
by 046.

1514
01:21:20.375 --> 01:21:22.252
Roll angle 31 degrees.

1515
01:21:23.587 --> 01:21:25.463
Best safe speed to St. Nishith.

1516
01:21:26.798 --> 01:21:28.041
Aye sir.

1517
01:21:28.091 --> 01:21:30.468
Course. 185 by 046.

1518
01:21:32.095 --> 01:21:33.847
Roll angle 31 degrees.

1519
01:21:35.098 --> 01:21:36.308
Thrusting ahead.
