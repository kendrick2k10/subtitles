<i>Please.</i>

00:01:55.637 --> 00:01:57.334
Please let me.
please let me out.

5
00:01:57.726 --> 00:01:58.553
Please let me out.

6
00:02:00.381 --> 00:02:04.080
Please. please. please let
me out of here. please.

7
00:02:04.776 --> 00:02:06.474
Please help.

8
00:02:14.482 --> 00:02:17.093
Yes. Mr. Neely. Mr. Neely.

9
00:02:21.967 --> 00:02:23.491
Bet you didn't think you'd
end up here. did you?

10
00:02:24.666 --> 00:02:25.493
No.

11
00:02:26.972 --> 00:02:30.411
Tell me about yourself.
you're a world class hacker.

12
00:02:30.411 --> 00:02:32.891
Maybe a first rate...

13
00:02:32.891 --> 00:02:34.066
analyst.

14
00:02:34.066 --> 00:02:35.590
A greedy analyst. What is it?

15
00:02:35.807 --> 00:02:38.158
What is it? What is it
you do. Mr. Neely?

16
00:02:39.115 --> 00:02:40.247
Please. okay?

17
00:02:41.248 --> 00:02:42.640
I will cooperate with you.

18
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.207
I. I will tell you whatever
you want.

19
00:02:44.207 --> 00:02:45.948
Anything you want to know.

20
00:02:49.647 --> 00:02:51.040
I don't give a fuck
what you know.

21
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.998
I really don't. Means
nothing to me.

22
00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:55.871
It's what you're worth.

23
00:02:59.614 --> 00:03:01.398
Hmm. Apparently. it's allowed

24
00:03:01.398 --> 00:03:02.878
you've made some
powerful enemies my friend.

25
00:03:04.836 --> 00:03:06.186
I'm. I'm sorry.

26
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:07.404
Okay?

27
00:03:07.404 --> 00:03:08.710
I never meant to hurt anyone.

28
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.190
-  No.
- Okay. I just

29
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.408
I saw the numbers.

30
00:03:11.408 --> 00:03:12.888
- they were off.
-  The numbers.

31
00:03:12.888 --> 00:03:13.976
And I just. I just.

32
00:03:14.585 --> 00:03:16.196
-  Were off.
-  Mhmm.

33
00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:19.242
You're gonna make me
a rich man. Mr. Neely.

34
00:03:21.418 --> 00:03:22.550
Where was he?

35
00:03:23.507 --> 00:03:24.856
- He was at--
- At home.

36
00:03:26.031 --> 00:03:27.381
You were at home?

37
00:03:28.947 --> 00:03:30.514
What were you doing at home
eating popcorn watching...

38
00:03:30.514 --> 00:03:33.169
cartoon reruns?

39
00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:34.083
That's really stupid.

40
00:03:34.344 --> 00:03:35.606
You're stupid.

41
00:03:36.694 --> 00:03:38.218
Stupid. Mr. Neely.

42
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.308
A moron.

43
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.963
Just a moron.

44
00:03:45.486 --> 00:03:47.488
The Collective are getting
close to finding us.

45
00:03:47.836 --> 00:03:49.229
They're nothing to worry
about for the moment.

46
00:03:50.621 --> 00:03:53.276
They only have one
operative in Boston.

47
00:03:55.931 --> 00:03:57.280
You sure he's the only one?

48
00:03:57.585 --> 00:03:59.761
Yes. I got into their
system last night.

49
00:03:59.978 --> 00:04:01.110
Will they send more?

50
00:04:01.328 --> 00:04:03.243
If they do.
I'll know about it.

51
00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:06.246
We still have that apartment?

52
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.508
Yes. sir.

53
00:04:14.036 --> 00:04:15.472
Send them a bad tip.

54
00:04:15.472 --> 00:04:17.692
A set up. a meeting. a trap.

55
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.520
I don't want to hear
about him again.

56
00:04:20.956 --> 00:04:23.001
Nikita. can you set that up?

57
00:04:24.176 --> 00:04:25.352
I'll send some guys.

58
00:04:27.745 --> 00:04:29.399
-  Okay. look.

59
00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:32.446
Send some guys.

60
00:04:33.621 --> 00:04:35.275
So what do I do
about this one?

61
00:04:36.145 --> 00:04:37.059
This one?

62
00:04:37.973 --> 00:04:39.104
Mr. Neely.

63
00:04:40.541 --> 00:04:41.890
It looks kind of cozy
in there. actually.

64
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.413
Like a little rat.

65
00:04:44.022 --> 00:04:45.067
A little rat.

66
00:04:45.067 --> 00:04:46.547
sort of whistleblower.
isn't it?

67
00:04:46.547 --> 00:04:49.114
Little rat?

68
00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.640
Give the rat some cheese.

69
00:04:53.554 --> 00:04:56.208
-  Coming right up.

70
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.158
Please.

71
00:09:10.637 --> 00:09:12.290
Please. please.

72
00:09:12.813 --> 00:09:13.901
Please. please don't kill me.

73
00:09:14.641 --> 00:09:16.556
I'll pay you way
more than they will.

74
00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:35.836
Nice time.

75
00:09:38.012 --> 00:09:39.579
The fastest I've seen.

76
00:09:40.231 --> 00:09:41.581
Let's check your work.

77
00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:43.408
Dead.

78
00:09:43.757 --> 00:09:44.671
Dead.

79
00:09:44.671 --> 00:09:45.846
Definitely dead.

80
00:09:46.063 --> 00:09:46.890
Dead.

81
00:09:48.022 --> 00:09:48.849
Maybe.

82
00:09:50.851 --> 00:09:51.852
How '‘bout now?

83
00:09:53.854 --> 00:09:54.942
And the target?

84
00:09:57.335 --> 00:09:58.206
Good.

85
00:09:59.337 --> 00:10:00.817
Very good.
That's not so great.

86
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.604
- Yeah. it's not fatal.

87
00:10:06.344 --> 00:10:07.737
Fatal or not.

88
00:10:07.737 --> 00:10:09.391
Could distract you.

89
00:10:10.087 --> 00:10:11.915
Could take you out of the
game even for a second.

90
00:10:11.915 --> 00:10:13.264
That could be the difference.

91
00:10:13.961 --> 00:10:15.440
Otherwise. good job.

92
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:17.747
All right.

93
00:10:18.922 --> 00:10:19.836
Everybody.

94
00:10:21.272 --> 00:10:22.447
Say hello to the newest
member of The Collective.

95
00:10:27.844 --> 00:10:28.715
Welcome.

96
00:10:29.672 --> 00:10:31.718
Sic casus praecipuus.

97
00:10:31.979 --> 00:10:32.980
May the privilege fall.

98
00:10:33.545 --> 00:10:34.546
That's not just a motto.

99
00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:36.548
That's code.

100
00:10:36.853 --> 00:10:38.638
- Don't forget it.
- I won't.

101
00:10:40.335 --> 00:10:42.816
So. when's
my first assignment?

102
00:10:43.425 --> 00:10:44.731
- Excuse me?
-  Soon. or?

103
00:10:45.122 --> 00:10:46.602
You know. because
I could go right now.

104
00:10:46.602 --> 00:10:47.908
Good. Glad to hear it.

105
00:10:47.908 --> 00:10:49.257
You start in the
office tomorrow.

106
00:10:50.737 --> 00:10:52.303
You still got a lot to learn
about the organization.

107
00:11:14.848 --> 00:11:16.023
This is it?

108
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.460
This place looks like shit.

109
00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:38.872
Hi.

110
00:11:38.872 --> 00:11:41.178
- Hi! Name?
- Sam Alexander.

111
00:11:41.439 --> 00:11:42.571
Do you have an appointment?

112
00:11:42.789 --> 00:11:44.355
- Yes.
- With who?

113
00:11:44.573 --> 00:11:45.922
Dr. Casus.

114
00:11:49.578 --> 00:11:51.145
Can I see your confirmation?

115
00:11:51.754 --> 00:11:52.581
Yeah.

116
00:12:00.545 --> 00:12:02.809
- Huh. I. um.

117
00:12:03.113 --> 00:12:04.724
I don't see you in the system.

118
00:12:09.641 --> 00:12:10.468
I'm new.

119
00:12:11.339 --> 00:12:12.383
- Um.

120
00:12:13.776 --> 00:12:15.909
Is uh.
something wrong?

121
00:12:22.263 --> 00:12:23.568
Oh. hey. Sam.

122
00:12:24.221 --> 00:12:25.048
There you are.

123
00:12:26.876 --> 00:12:28.182
- He's with me.

124
00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:29.226
First day.

125
00:12:31.968 --> 00:12:33.317
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

126
00:12:33.535 --> 00:12:35.015
Well then.
welcome to The Collective.

127
00:12:35.493 --> 00:12:36.668
We'll make him a file later.

128
00:12:36.843 --> 00:12:38.235
but go ahead
and activate his pen.

129
00:12:38.496 --> 00:12:40.455
Sorry I didn't
get you in the system yet.

130
00:12:41.543 --> 00:12:43.110
- You scared her.
- Oh. all good.

131
00:12:43.719 --> 00:12:44.720
You're lucky
you got your legs.

132
00:12:45.373 --> 00:12:47.201
Oh. while you're in here. um.

133
00:12:47.418 --> 00:12:48.942
make sure you wear your pin.

134
00:12:49.159 --> 00:12:51.422
Because the doors have sensors
and can read the microchip

135
00:12:51.422 --> 00:12:52.467
from inside.

136
00:13:00.214 --> 00:13:02.564
And here we got
the control centre.

137
00:13:02.564 --> 00:13:04.131
Each one of the controllers
are the eyes

138
00:13:04.131 --> 00:13:06.089
and ears of every agent
in the field.

139
00:13:12.879 --> 00:13:14.315
- Door on the left.
- Hold on.

140
00:13:14.315 --> 00:13:15.838
There are seven guys on
the other side of that door.

141
00:13:15.838 --> 00:13:17.361
- Proceed with caution.
- Careful.

142
00:13:17.361 --> 00:13:18.928
There's an alarm.
Let me just disarm it.

143
00:13:20.321 --> 00:13:21.148
All right.

144
00:13:22.584 --> 00:13:23.672
And this is where
the collective decides

145
00:13:23.672 --> 00:13:25.500
which contracts
to send up the chain.

146
00:13:25.717 --> 00:13:26.936
You'll start here.

147
00:13:28.285 --> 00:13:29.765
Doing paperwork?

148
00:13:30.157 --> 00:13:31.811
We all start somewhere. Sam.

149
00:13:32.072 --> 00:13:32.899
Good luck.

150
00:13:53.528 --> 00:13:55.225
So you're the one that
beat my time

151
00:13:55.225 --> 00:13:56.748
on the training course.

152
00:13:57.053 --> 00:13:58.750
You're a little old. no?

153
00:14:03.103 --> 00:14:04.147
I'm Robert.

154
00:14:04.669 --> 00:14:06.106
And that's Barbara.

155
00:14:06.106 --> 00:14:06.933
Not that you will.

156
00:14:08.369 --> 00:14:09.109
But if you need anything.
we'd be happy to help.

157
00:14:11.154 --> 00:14:12.590
I'd be happy to help.

158
00:14:13.243 --> 00:14:15.637
Can you tell me how long
I'll be staying in contracts?

159
00:14:16.246 --> 00:14:18.074
Field agents
always start here.

160
00:14:18.292 --> 00:14:19.902
If you're desperate
for some action.

161
00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.164
you can move to control.

162
00:14:21.164 --> 00:14:22.426
Sorry.

163
00:14:24.037 --> 00:14:25.212
Didn't just leave my desk job so
I could work another desk job.

164
00:14:27.649 --> 00:14:29.390
Then you'll put in the
time like the rest of us.

165
00:14:29.607 --> 00:14:30.913
What's your background?

166
00:14:36.484 --> 00:14:38.486
I worked for the DA.

167
00:14:38.486 --> 00:14:39.487
-  Oh.

168
00:14:40.183 --> 00:14:41.358
Really?

169
00:14:42.011 --> 00:14:43.317
So you're an attorney?

170
00:14:44.144 --> 00:14:45.449
I was.

171
00:14:45.449 --> 00:14:46.755
And then I got bored.

172
00:14:47.277 --> 00:14:49.323
I don't see how that
translates into wet work.

173
00:14:52.021 --> 00:14:53.805
You watch enough
guilty people walk free

174
00:14:53.805 --> 00:14:55.198
and eventually
you want to go out there

175
00:14:55.198 --> 00:14:56.547
and take care of them yourself.

176
00:14:56.547 --> 00:14:57.461
Hmm.

177
00:14:57.809 --> 00:14:59.159
Very proactive.

178
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.812
Look. I get that.

179
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.119
But don't be so anxious
to get out there.

180
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:04.904
The training course
is one thing.

181
00:15:05.426 --> 00:15:07.080
but the real world.

182
00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:10.257
would eat you alive.

183
00:15:11.258 --> 00:15:13.086
- I'm not so sure about that.

184
00:15:13.521 --> 00:15:14.565
We'll see.

185
00:15:15.262 --> 00:15:16.350
Barb.

186
00:15:30.146 --> 00:15:31.843
But if we wait.

187
00:15:32.018 --> 00:15:34.194
We're gonna miss our
chance at getting Neely

188
00:15:34.194 --> 00:15:35.586
and all of his intel.

189
00:15:37.023 --> 00:15:38.938
Can't afford to lose you either.

190
00:15:39.764 --> 00:15:41.288
If we have the shot.

191
00:15:42.115 --> 00:15:43.464
we have to take it.

192
00:15:43.725 --> 00:15:44.682
Come on. Hugo.

193
00:15:44.682 --> 00:15:45.727
It's not Bin Laden.

194
00:15:45.727 --> 00:15:47.163
We're gonna get
another chance.

195
00:15:47.163 --> 00:15:48.077
<i>Yes. at Miro.</i>

196
00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:50.079
But if we wait.

197
00:15:50.079 --> 00:15:52.125
we'll miss our chance
at getting Neely.

198
00:15:52.125 --> 00:15:53.909
All right.

199
00:15:54.866 --> 00:15:57.391
Well. give us a day to
verify the reports.

200
00:15:57.391 --> 00:15:58.783
get a schematic
of the building.

201
00:15:58.783 --> 00:16:00.394
and I'll hook you up
with a controller.

202
00:16:00.742 --> 00:16:02.483
No. there's no time.

203
00:16:03.397 --> 00:16:06.704
Because we don't know how
soon until he auctions Neely.

204
00:16:11.187 --> 00:16:12.623
You know I'm right.

205
00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:14.712
Of course you are.

206
00:16:16.323 --> 00:16:18.064
It's an apartment building.

207
00:16:18.586 --> 00:16:21.023
<i>With two elevators.
two sets of stairs.</i>

208
00:16:21.023 --> 00:16:22.807
<i>and four escape routes.</i>

209
00:16:23.156 --> 00:16:24.766
Can't be that easy.

210
00:16:24.766 --> 00:16:26.898
Miro hasn't been caught
yet for a reason.

211
00:16:27.464 --> 00:16:29.118
Because I haven't tried yet.

212
00:16:31.773 --> 00:16:32.861
All right.

213
00:16:33.731 --> 00:16:34.819
You're too damn stubborn

214
00:16:34.819 --> 00:16:36.473
for this conversation
to go anywhere.

215
00:16:36.473 --> 00:16:37.909
So I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

216
00:16:38.084 --> 00:16:39.607
I will let you go in there.

217
00:16:39.868 --> 00:16:41.000
not because I want to.

218
00:16:41.217 --> 00:16:42.871
because I know you're
gonna do it anyway.

219
00:16:43.567 --> 00:16:44.568
Anything else?

220
00:16:45.178 --> 00:16:46.005
Yeah.

221
00:16:47.397 --> 00:16:48.703
Do you want anything special
said at your funeral?

222
00:16:49.138 --> 00:16:51.184
You're not invited
to my funeral.

223
00:16:51.445 --> 00:16:54.013
Oh. I. I wasn't coming anyway.

224
00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.668
So. do we have a deal?

225
00:17:06.547 --> 00:17:08.288
- Hey. Sam.

226
00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:09.811
You got a minute?

227
00:17:22.998 --> 00:17:25.392
Come in. Sam. Sit down.

228
00:17:27.524 --> 00:17:29.048
Take a look at that file.

229
00:17:29.309 --> 00:17:30.658
I'd like to hear your thoughts.

230
00:17:35.358 --> 00:17:37.143
Out loud. please.

231
00:17:39.493 --> 00:17:40.624
Okay.

232
00:17:42.017 --> 00:17:43.975
Miro Lindell.

233
00:17:45.412 --> 00:17:48.110
He's a notorious human
trafficking kingpin.

234
00:17:48.937 --> 00:17:50.939
He's in bed with
billionaires. politicians.

235
00:17:50.939 --> 00:17:52.549
law enforcement. you name it.

236
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:54.247
Basically untouchable.

237
00:17:55.596 --> 00:17:56.727
So is he?

238
00:17:58.164 --> 00:18:00.035
Untouchable? No.

239
00:18:00.209 --> 00:18:01.602
Nobody's untouchable.

240
00:18:05.432 --> 00:18:06.563
If anything. seems a
little too easy.

241
00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:09.262
There's no special
security protocols

242
00:18:09.262 --> 00:18:10.393
outside of a detail.

243
00:18:10.654 --> 00:18:12.047
I mean. at most. you're
facing guards

244
00:18:12.047 --> 00:18:13.701
at the ground level
and at the apartment.

245
00:18:14.005 --> 00:18:15.703
All right.
so what would you do?

246
00:18:17.618 --> 00:18:19.054
Are you asking
me if I want this?

247
00:18:19.359 --> 00:18:20.882
I'm asking for your thoughts.

248
00:18:24.625 --> 00:18:26.235
I go in at night.

249
00:18:26.801 --> 00:18:27.932
late at night.

250
00:18:27.932 --> 00:18:29.456
when the least
civilians are around.

251
00:18:38.682 --> 00:18:39.944
<i>It's an
apartment building. so.</i>

252
00:18:42.338 --> 00:18:44.427
Ground level guards would
be less conspicuous.

253
00:18:45.254 --> 00:18:47.691
<i>Lookouts assessing
who comes and goes.</i>

254
00:19:04.186 --> 00:19:06.449
I'm somewhat
of a master of disguise. so.

255
00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:08.973
Master of disguise. huh?

256
00:19:11.019 --> 00:19:11.976
Somewhat.

257
00:19:13.369 --> 00:19:15.806
Anyway. I walk right in
without firing a shot.

258
00:19:43.356 --> 00:19:44.313
Okay.

259
00:19:44.313 --> 00:19:46.141
You're in the building now.

260
00:19:46.141 --> 00:19:47.142
What's next?

261
00:19:49.405 --> 00:19:50.232
Well.

262
00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:52.843
you need access
to the elevator.

263
00:19:52.843 --> 00:19:54.062
Lucky for us. the controller
could easily hack into it.

264
00:20:20.436 --> 00:20:23.657
Quick. clean. and simple.

265
00:20:25.833 --> 00:20:27.487
There would be guards
in the hallway.

266
00:20:27.791 --> 00:20:29.837
I would keep my distance and.

267
00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.448
try and take them out
before they engage.

268
00:20:51.206 --> 00:20:52.599
I'd be especially careful

269
00:20:52.599 --> 00:20:54.557
about the guards located
outside the front door.

270
00:20:55.341 --> 00:20:57.343
That's where I'd put
my toughest guys.

271
00:21:20.409 --> 00:21:22.237
It's all downhill from there.

272
00:21:23.934 --> 00:21:26.720
It's a good plan. on paper.

273
00:21:28.548 --> 00:21:29.897
What does your gut say?

274
00:21:31.942 --> 00:21:33.161
It's a trap.

275
00:22:48.367 --> 00:22:50.281
Field work is rarely simple.

276
00:22:51.021 --> 00:22:52.762
One has to be prepared
to improvise.

277
00:22:57.593 --> 00:22:59.203
That kind of training
takes time.

278
00:23:00.379 --> 00:23:01.684
Well. how can I learn
when I'm stuck here

279
00:23:01.684 --> 00:23:03.251
doing contracts?

280
00:23:06.341 --> 00:23:07.298
Stuck?

281
00:23:08.212 --> 00:23:09.518
Sam. it's your first day.

282
00:23:11.477 --> 00:23:13.261
You want me on this
assignment. don't you?

283
00:23:15.089 --> 00:23:17.308
I promise I can get it done.

284
00:23:22.749 --> 00:23:24.098
Go back to work.

285
00:24:25.681 --> 00:24:27.030
Amazing. You're alive.

286
00:24:27.248 --> 00:24:28.945
He wasn't there.

287
00:24:29.772 --> 00:24:30.599
<i>Fuck.</i>

288
00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:33.297
There were men waiting for me.

289
00:24:35.343 --> 00:24:36.953
Well. that means
they're in our system.

290
00:24:37.519 --> 00:24:38.477
You're compromised.

291
00:24:38.999 --> 00:24:40.653
How can you let this happen?

292
00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:43.220
<i>I would say it was Neely.</i>

293
00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:45.788
<i>He clearly has more
intel on us than we realized.</i>

294
00:24:46.441 --> 00:24:47.529
<i>We have to pull you out.</i>

295
00:24:47.747 --> 00:24:49.270
No. not happening.

296
00:24:49.792 --> 00:24:51.751
Well. it's not safe anymore.

297
00:24:52.229 --> 00:24:53.796
<i>We need Neely.</i>

298
00:24:53.796 --> 00:24:55.058
Well. if he knows about you

299
00:24:55.058 --> 00:24:56.582
and he knows
about all of our other agents.

300
00:24:56.582 --> 00:24:58.888
how are we going to get him
if he can see us coming?

301
00:25:00.411 --> 00:25:02.239
Then what do you suggest?

302
00:25:04.067 --> 00:25:05.591
It's pretty obvious to me
that we need

303
00:25:05.591 --> 00:25:08.158
someone
that's not in our system.

367
00:28:56.473 --> 00:28:57.474
<i>There's a car waiting</i>

368
00:28:57.474 --> 00:28:58.562
<i>to take you to the airport.</i>

369
00:28:58.562 --> 00:29:00.129
Uh. is everything okay?

370
00:29:00.434 --> 00:29:02.175
<i>No. Now pack your bags.</i>

371
00:29:02.175 --> 00:29:03.437
Wait.

372
00:29:03.742 --> 00:29:04.830
Commercial or private?

373
00:29:05.221 --> 00:29:06.048
<i>Private.</i>

374
00:30:47.976 --> 00:30:49.978
Sir. your pin?

375
00:30:51.501 --> 00:30:52.328
Right.

376
00:30:56.463 --> 00:30:57.290
Thank you.

377
00:32:59.064 --> 00:33:01.109
Are. uh. are you Hugo?

378
00:33:02.458 --> 00:33:03.590
Who are you?

379
00:33:04.808 --> 00:33:06.375
I'm. uh. Sam.

380
00:33:07.115 --> 00:33:08.464
Can I come in?

381
00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.641
Why haven't I seen you before?

382
00:33:12.077 --> 00:33:14.079
Liam sent me. I'm. uh. new.

383
00:33:17.778 --> 00:33:20.737
You. uh. gonna let
me in or what?

384
00:33:21.521 --> 00:33:23.044
Grab the shit.

385
00:33:29.572 --> 00:33:31.444
- It's a nice place.

386
00:33:31.444 --> 00:33:32.532
This way.

387
00:33:44.326 --> 00:33:46.111
Put things in here.

388
00:33:56.947 --> 00:33:58.253
I don't need guns.

389
00:33:58.906 --> 00:33:59.950
I got plenty here.

390
00:34:01.256 --> 00:34:03.041
Yeah. but I figured I'd
be prepared anyways.

391
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:06.827
What's that?

392
00:34:08.046 --> 00:34:09.656
Disguise. Handbook
said to bring one.

393
00:34:10.178 --> 00:34:11.658
I'm Miami Vice.
don't you think?

394
00:34:18.839 --> 00:34:20.493
You don't need a grenade.

395
00:34:20.928 --> 00:34:22.321
It's never good.

396
00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.238
Fuck around and blow up

397
00:34:26.238 --> 00:34:27.761
the wrong shit.

398
00:34:27.761 --> 00:34:28.762
I use it while I'm training.

399
00:34:28.762 --> 00:34:30.068
So. I just kind of figured

400
00:34:30.068 --> 00:34:30.894
it would be a...

401
00:34:34.594 --> 00:34:36.378
You heard
what I said. right?

402
00:34:37.945 --> 00:34:38.728
Yeah.

403
00:34:40.948 --> 00:34:41.862
- All right. So.

404
00:34:41.862 --> 00:34:42.732
When do we get started?

405
00:34:44.734 --> 00:34:46.171
Slow down.

406
00:34:46.171 --> 00:34:47.172
I don't know you.

407
00:34:48.651 --> 00:34:49.478
Okay.

408
00:34:49.478 --> 00:34:50.653
What do you want to know?

409
00:34:54.353 --> 00:34:56.703
All right. I guess I can just...

410
00:34:58.487 --> 00:34:59.662
From New Jersey.

411
00:34:59.662 --> 00:35:02.709
I just got this pin
three days ago.

412
00:35:02.709 --> 00:35:03.971
so I guess you could say

413
00:35:03.971 --> 00:35:05.581
this is my first assignment.

414
00:35:06.234 --> 00:35:07.801
And I used to work

415
00:35:07.801 --> 00:35:10.238
for the district
attorney's office.

416
00:35:10.238 --> 00:35:12.110
And now I'm here.

417
00:35:13.241 --> 00:35:15.200
So no military.

418
00:35:15.591 --> 00:35:16.418
CIA.

419
00:35:18.551 --> 00:35:20.857
special ops background. nothing?

420
00:35:21.075 --> 00:35:22.337
No. I mean. I trained
martial arts.

421
00:35:22.555 --> 00:35:23.947
I did karate.

422
00:35:32.304 --> 00:35:33.392
Karate?

423
00:35:36.525 --> 00:35:38.832
So you're useless to me.

424
00:35:43.706 --> 00:35:44.577
Listen. you clearly

425
00:35:44.577 --> 00:35:45.882
don't want me here.

426
00:35:45.882 --> 00:35:47.101
but I'm here.

427
00:35:47.319 --> 00:35:48.102
I'm not on the books.

428
00:35:49.364 --> 00:35:50.278
So Miro couldn't
possibly know about me.

429
00:35:50.278 --> 00:35:52.150
So. until I die.

430
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:53.629
or Liam sends me home.

431
00:35:53.629 --> 00:35:54.804
I'm staying.

432
00:35:57.807 --> 00:35:59.635
We both want the same thing.

433
00:36:00.419 --> 00:36:02.160
I'm telling you. we do.

434
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.031
You need me to take down Miro.

435
00:36:04.727 --> 00:36:06.903
Sic casus praecipuus.

436
00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:09.210
Let's make him fall.

437
00:36:13.867 --> 00:36:15.521
Do you even
know what that means?

438
00:36:16.043 --> 00:36:16.870
Yeah.

439
00:36:17.305 --> 00:36:18.176
Do you?

440
00:36:18.437 --> 00:36:20.482
I made up the fucking slogan.

441
00:36:22.658 --> 00:36:23.529
Oh.

442
00:36:23.529 --> 00:36:24.791
You and your yellow belt.

443
00:36:24.791 --> 00:36:26.488
- Follow me.
- My bad.

444
00:36:26.488 --> 00:36:27.663
Where are we going?

445
00:36:28.751 --> 00:36:29.752
This way.

446
00:36:37.804 --> 00:36:39.588
You've never
seen this room.

447
00:36:41.286 --> 00:36:43.201
This is the war room.

448
00:36:44.376 --> 00:36:46.247
Liam and I.

449
00:36:46.247 --> 00:36:48.684
have countless operations.

450
00:36:48.684 --> 00:36:49.859
from here.

451
00:36:51.165 --> 00:36:52.645
Even toppling governments.

452
00:36:52.645 --> 00:36:54.212
Toppling governments?

453
00:36:54.908 --> 00:36:57.040
The CIA have a list of enemies

454
00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.999
that they consider

455
00:36:59.304 --> 00:37:00.609
untouchable.

456
00:37:00.609 --> 00:37:02.045
People like Miro.

457
00:37:02.524 --> 00:37:04.831
Liam and I got sick of ignoring

458
00:37:04.831 --> 00:37:06.485
the root of the problem.

459
00:37:08.313 --> 00:37:09.749
So we left.

460
00:37:10.315 --> 00:37:11.925
And started The Collective.

461
00:37:11.925 --> 00:37:12.795
Our targets

462
00:37:12.795 --> 00:37:15.276
think they are above the law.

463
00:37:15.276 --> 00:37:17.191
So we speak for the innocent.

464
00:37:17.191 --> 00:37:19.541
Judge. jury and executioner.

465
00:37:20.063 --> 00:37:21.456
And now we take down Miro.

466
00:37:22.109 --> 00:37:22.936
No.

467
00:37:24.416 --> 00:37:25.591
No? What about the apartment?

468
00:37:26.418 --> 00:37:28.202
I wasn't there for Miro.

469
00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:31.379
I was there to
get Christopher Neely.

470
00:37:35.688 --> 00:37:36.515
He's our target.

471
00:37:36.515 --> 00:37:37.907
He's an analyst.

472
00:37:37.907 --> 00:37:39.561
He's leaked information

473
00:37:39.561 --> 00:37:41.998
about billionaires
buying elections.

474
00:37:41.998 --> 00:37:44.653
Now. Miro has him hostage.

475
00:37:45.175 --> 00:37:47.090
He's planning to sell him

476
00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:48.309
to the highest bidder.

477
00:37:48.962 --> 00:37:51.138
That's fifty million? Really?

478
00:37:51.138 --> 00:37:52.313
He'll probably sell him

479
00:37:52.313 --> 00:37:53.923
for more than that.

480
00:37:54.359 --> 00:37:55.664
Pissed off a lot of people.

481
00:37:56.665 --> 00:37:58.798
Okay. so why are we involved?

482
00:37:59.102 --> 00:38:00.147
Christopher is key

483
00:38:00.147 --> 00:38:01.931
to taking down
the untouchables.

484
00:38:02.889 --> 00:38:03.759
All right then.

485
00:38:03.759 --> 00:38:04.717
Let's go find him.

486
00:38:04.717 --> 00:38:06.327
It's not that easy.

487
00:38:06.893 --> 00:38:08.242
We don't know where he is.

488
00:38:08.851 --> 00:38:10.505
I read Miro's file.

489
00:38:11.071 --> 00:38:13.247
- He would keep him close.

490
00:38:15.249 --> 00:38:17.033
He's constantly moving.

491
00:38:17.382 --> 00:38:18.513
He travels all over.

492
00:38:19.688 --> 00:38:21.299
Hosting human auctions.

493
00:38:23.649 --> 00:38:24.867
And only untouchables

494
00:38:24.867 --> 00:38:25.955
get invited.

495
00:38:27.392 --> 00:38:28.393
Okay.

496
00:38:29.437 --> 00:38:31.309
Maybe we can find one.

497
00:38:35.182 --> 00:38:36.226
What are you doing?

498
00:38:36.226 --> 00:38:37.576
A little background research.

499
00:38:37.576 --> 00:38:39.969
Picked it up
working for the DA.

500
00:38:40.448 --> 00:38:43.059
And this is the
exact type of guy

501
00:38:43.059 --> 00:38:45.584
Miro would reach out
to. George Lee.

502
00:38:45.888 --> 00:38:47.150
And he'd want revenge for Barry

503
00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:48.369
Vanderstorm's death.

504
00:38:48.369 --> 00:38:49.762
He'd pay about anything for it.

505
00:38:58.858 --> 00:39:01.643
And guess who's in town?

506
00:39:01.643 --> 00:39:02.514
I'm guessing the auction

507
00:39:02.514 --> 00:39:04.603
is somewhere around this area.

508
00:39:05.386 --> 00:39:07.345
Looks like we're
going to the beach.

509
00:39:10.609 --> 00:39:11.784
What? Why not?

510
00:39:11.784 --> 00:39:13.960
Well. if Miro finds
out about this.

511
00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:16.266
Which he will.

512
00:39:16.266 --> 00:39:17.616
And you'll be made. too.

513
00:39:18.617 --> 00:39:19.792
Yeah. but we have to try.

514
00:39:19.792 --> 00:39:21.141
I mean. capture this guy

515
00:39:21.141 --> 00:39:22.621
and then get the auction
info out of him.

516
00:39:22.882 --> 00:39:24.057
Then one of Miro's clients

517
00:39:24.057 --> 00:39:26.102
goes missing. and he knows

518
00:39:26.973 --> 00:39:29.105
It's not worth
jeopardizing the mission.

519
00:39:32.848 --> 00:39:34.415
What if the auction's tonight?

520
00:39:34.415 --> 00:39:35.721
You got a better idea?

521
00:39:35.721 --> 00:39:36.852
Give me your pen.

522
00:39:36.852 --> 00:39:37.897
What?

523
00:39:38.724 --> 00:39:40.116
Give it to me.

524
00:39:40.116 --> 00:39:40.987
Yeah.

525
00:39:45.383 --> 00:39:46.993
Are you. uh.
controlling for me?

526
00:39:46.993 --> 00:39:49.648
I'm making sure you don't die.

527
00:39:51.171 --> 00:39:52.128
Thanks.

528
00:39:54.957 --> 00:39:57.003
These are
my eyes and ears.

529
00:39:57.482 --> 00:39:59.614
And when you get back.

530
00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:02.095
I'm gonna teach
you the pistol puppet.

531
00:40:02.748 --> 00:40:04.097
The pistol puppet?

532
00:40:04.619 --> 00:40:05.577
Wear this.

533
00:40:12.758 --> 00:40:14.063
Uh. one more thing.

534
00:40:14.455 --> 00:40:16.109
I'm gonna need
to borrow your car.

535
00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:22.245
I don't have one.

536
00:41:12.165 --> 00:41:13.209
They're here.

537
00:41:28.442 --> 00:41:30.400
Give me your thing. baby.
Do your thing. That's it.

538
00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:31.532
That is it.

539
00:41:31.532 --> 00:41:33.447
Yeah. Gosh. you're so hot.

540
00:41:33.447 --> 00:41:35.144
I should have brought
two cameras.

541
00:41:35.144 --> 00:41:36.581
This is amazing.

542
00:41:36.581 --> 00:41:37.756
Look at you.

543
00:41:40.541 --> 00:41:41.977
That is amazing.

544
00:41:41.977 --> 00:41:43.196
Yeah.

545
00:41:43.196 --> 00:41:45.503
Yeah. do this like.
like that.

546
00:41:45.807 --> 00:41:46.634
Shooting from the hip.

547
00:41:46.634 --> 00:41:47.983
Boom. boom. boom.

548
00:41:48.201 --> 00:41:49.158
Love it.

549
00:41:51.944 --> 00:41:52.727
You saw how you could

550
00:41:53.946 --> 00:41:54.990
bring MySpace back
with these pictures.

551
00:41:58.864 --> 00:42:00.735
So what's your plan?

552
00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:02.258
I'm gonna get behind cover.

553
00:42:02.258 --> 00:42:03.608
Take the guards out
one at a time.

554
00:42:04.957 --> 00:42:06.262
No good.

555
00:42:06.262 --> 00:42:07.612
<i>But it's clean.</i>

556
00:42:07.873 --> 00:42:10.092
Right. So you
shoot the first guy.

557
00:42:10.092 --> 00:42:11.790
They all notice.

558
00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:12.965
Then what?

559
00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:15.794
I take them out.

560
00:42:15.794 --> 00:42:17.491
You take them out.

561
00:42:17.491 --> 00:42:19.232
And you waste your time.

562
00:42:21.582 --> 00:42:23.105
So you want to just
show up and start shooting?

563
00:42:23.671 --> 00:42:25.891
It's called
an ambush. and it works.

564
00:42:30.373 --> 00:42:32.288
That's it. Beautiful.

565
00:42:32.288 --> 00:42:34.029
Now. can you do the thing
where you turn around

566
00:42:34.029 --> 00:42:35.814
and like. look
over your shoulder.

567
00:42:35.814 --> 00:42:36.641
Oh. yeah. that's it.

568
00:42:36.641 --> 00:42:37.816
Oh. down from your knees.

569
00:42:37.816 --> 00:42:39.600
I like it. Look at you.

570
00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:40.601
You're a pro.

571
00:42:40.601 --> 00:42:42.995
Wow. Wow.

572
00:42:47.347 --> 00:42:50.089
<i>Walk on to the
beach. then draw.</i>

573
00:42:51.699 --> 00:42:53.266
I'm staying here.

574
00:42:56.574 --> 00:42:58.445
Pistols are only good

575
00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.447
<i>from a certain distance.</i>

576
00:43:01.056 --> 00:43:01.840
I'm going to
get behind cover.

577
00:43:03.668 --> 00:43:03.711
<i>I'm going to take out
the guards one at a time.</i>

578
00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:05.452
Not accurately.

579
00:43:08.673 --> 00:43:10.849
Hey. That was great.

580
00:43:10.849 --> 00:43:12.372
You're amazing.

581
00:43:13.721 --> 00:43:15.810
One. two.

582
00:43:16.768 --> 00:43:17.986
- Three.

583
00:43:22.295 --> 00:43:23.383
- Dammit.

584
00:43:27.779 --> 00:43:29.128
Should have been closer.

585
00:43:31.652 --> 00:43:32.914
Not now!

586
00:43:44.839 --> 00:43:45.927
Get behind cover!

587
00:44:10.778 --> 00:44:13.041
<i>Sam! Sam?</i>

588
00:44:14.086 --> 00:44:15.304
Sam?

589
00:44:17.263 --> 00:44:19.439
-  <i>Sam?</i>
- Yeah. I'm here.

590
00:44:19.439 --> 00:44:20.309
Oh.

591
00:44:20.919 --> 00:44:22.094
What was that?

592
00:44:39.938 --> 00:44:41.069
<i>Flip him over.</i>

593
00:44:41.069 --> 00:44:41.983
Oh. God.

594
00:44:41.983 --> 00:44:42.984
Please don't kill me.

595
00:44:42.984 --> 00:44:44.116
- Shut up!

596
00:44:44.116 --> 00:44:45.683
Shut up! Shut up!

597
00:44:45.683 --> 00:44:46.640
You understand?

598
00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:47.946
Need to hurry.

599
00:44:48.947 --> 00:44:49.730
Miro Lindell.

600
00:44:50.078 --> 00:44:50.775
You know him?

601
00:44:52.167 --> 00:44:53.647
- All right. okay. [shushes].

602
00:44:53.908 --> 00:44:55.475
I know you're here for the
auction. What time is it?

603
00:44:56.302 --> 00:44:58.130
- Auction?

604
00:45:00.393 --> 00:45:01.699
- What time is it?
- I don't know.

605
00:45:02.221 --> 00:45:03.744
-  You see that?

606
00:45:03.744 --> 00:45:04.876
That's how you're going to
look if you lie to me

607
00:45:04.876 --> 00:45:06.051
one more time.

608
00:45:08.401 --> 00:45:09.532
Saturday.

609
00:45:09.532 --> 00:45:11.273
-  Saturday? Six.
- What time?

610
00:45:11.273 --> 00:45:12.231
Which six?

611
00:45:12.753 --> 00:45:14.146
Six a.m.. six in the morning!

612
00:45:14.146 --> 00:45:16.539
- Please don't hurt me.
- Okay. good. Where is it?

613
00:45:16.844 --> 00:45:17.758
I don't know.

614
00:45:17.758 --> 00:45:19.238
I promise. I swear.

615
00:45:19.238 --> 00:45:20.369
I don't know.

616
00:45:20.369 --> 00:45:21.849
They. they don't
send the address

617
00:45:21.849 --> 00:45:23.503
until an hour before.

618
00:45:26.332 --> 00:45:27.768
Just aim your camera

619
00:45:27.768 --> 00:45:29.770
so I can see into his eyes.

620
00:45:42.478 --> 00:45:44.698
He's telling the truth.

621
00:45:45.917 --> 00:45:47.135
<i>He's scared.</i>

622
00:45:47.135 --> 00:45:48.746
<i>but he never broke
eye contact.</i>

623
00:45:49.268 --> 00:45:51.226
You're going to
have to kill him now.

624
00:45:53.489 --> 00:45:54.360
What?

625
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:58.756
He can identify you.

626
00:46:02.368 --> 00:46:04.196
Do it now.
Don't overthink this.

627
00:46:05.284 --> 00:46:06.111
Wait. wait. wait. no!

628
00:46:09.767 --> 00:46:10.419
Yep.

629
00:46:11.986 --> 00:46:14.293
That's what blood
and brains look like.

630
00:46:14.772 --> 00:46:16.121
<i>Take a picture.</i>

631
00:46:16.948 --> 00:46:19.167
<i>Short is a price on his head.</i>

632
00:46:19.167 --> 00:46:20.255
And grab his phone.

633
00:46:20.255 --> 00:46:21.648
We got to be ready to attack

634
00:46:21.648 --> 00:46:22.910
the moment
a text comes through.

635
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:28.873
Time to come back.

636
00:46:28.873 --> 00:46:31.049
We got a lot of work to do.

637
00:46:41.363 --> 00:46:43.278
What the fuck is taking
you so long?

638
00:46:43.975 --> 00:46:45.150
We don't know where he is.

639
00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:47.021
This entire auction
is going to implode

640
00:46:47.021 --> 00:46:49.328
- if you can't figure out the--
-  Found him.

641
00:46:50.546 --> 00:46:51.765
I guess the apartment ambush

642
00:46:51.765 --> 00:46:53.680
wasn't a complete failure.

643
00:46:54.986 --> 00:46:56.204
In Massachusetts.

644
00:46:56.204 --> 00:46:57.815
he goes by the alias of Mark

645
00:46:57.815 --> 00:46:59.120
Vorhee. or Vorhee.

646
00:46:59.904 --> 00:47:01.644
The CCTV captured him parking

647
00:47:01.644 --> 00:47:03.429
and walking into the apartment building.

648
00:47:03.429 --> 00:47:05.605
Where's the car registered?

649
00:47:07.999 --> 00:47:09.087
It's close.

650
00:47:09.783 --> 00:47:10.262
Good.

651
00:47:11.089 --> 00:47:11.916
I got somebody who knows

652
00:47:11.916 --> 00:47:13.178
what the fuck they're doing.

653
00:47:13.787 --> 00:47:16.050
Why are you still standing
here? Go.

654
00:47:49.562 --> 00:47:51.781
-  Top that off for you.

655
00:48:03.706 --> 00:48:05.186
How you holding up?

656
00:48:11.018 --> 00:48:12.454
I lost control.

657
00:48:12.454 --> 00:48:13.847
That's
never happened to me before.

658
00:48:21.333 --> 00:48:23.552
A hundred thousand
for your first kill.

659
00:48:26.033 --> 00:48:27.730
Not too shabby.

660
00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:34.563
I want to make sure
I clarify something.

661
00:48:36.914 --> 00:48:37.871
Liam.

662
00:48:38.567 --> 00:48:40.395
he's a stone cold killer.

663
00:48:40.874 --> 00:48:42.571
Not to be fucked with.

664
00:48:42.832 --> 00:48:44.747
He would kill four
or five people.

665
00:48:45.139 --> 00:48:46.401
and two hours later.

666
00:48:46.401 --> 00:48:48.316
we'd sit and eat dinner.
and he's laughing

667
00:48:48.316 --> 00:48:49.839
like nothing ever happened.

668
00:48:55.106 --> 00:48:56.324
Fucking nuts.

669
00:49:08.597 --> 00:49:10.469
I remember back.

670
00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:12.993
My first kill.

671
00:49:14.081 --> 00:49:16.170
In the CIA.

672
00:49:18.781 --> 00:49:19.957
It wasn't the kill

673
00:49:19.957 --> 00:49:21.871
that kept me up at night.

674
00:49:23.047 --> 00:49:25.701
It was the sound of his

675
00:49:25.701 --> 00:49:27.703
fractured skull.

676
00:49:29.531 --> 00:49:31.316
That shit plays in my mind

677
00:49:31.316 --> 00:49:34.972
over and over and over again.

678
00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.585
But you'll get numb to it.

679
00:49:40.238 --> 00:49:42.980
- So it gets easier?
- No.

680
00:49:44.677 --> 00:49:47.288
And that's why I live
in the middle of nowhere.

681
00:49:47.723 --> 00:49:49.812
I find peace in isolation.

682
00:49:53.555 --> 00:49:55.427
You got to do what you
got to do. right?

683
00:49:57.733 --> 00:49:59.213
To kill The Untouchables.

684
00:49:59.561 --> 00:50:00.693
Yeah.

685
00:50:01.215 --> 00:50:03.565
We're in a league of our own.

686
00:50:19.016 --> 00:50:20.321
I paid a lot of money

687
00:50:20.321 --> 00:50:22.062
for you motherfuckers.

688
00:50:22.410 --> 00:50:24.325
Don't make me look bad.

689
00:50:45.477 --> 00:50:47.566
Don't send your men
in unless I say so.

690
00:51:07.499 --> 00:51:09.936
- First team's in position.
-  <i>Breach.</i>

691
00:51:14.114 --> 00:51:14.941
Sam. get down!

692
00:51:36.658 --> 00:51:38.530
Meet me in the war room. now!

693
00:51:40.662 --> 00:51:41.794
First team is down.

694
00:51:41.794 --> 00:51:44.275
Repeat. First team is down!

695
00:51:49.628 --> 00:51:51.978
<i>I told you not to
make me look stupid.</i>

696
00:51:51.978 --> 00:51:53.371
<i>Send second team.</i>

697
00:51:53.371 --> 00:51:54.894
<i>Send them now. goddammit!</i>

698
00:52:27.622 --> 00:52:29.450
Front door
has been breached.

699
00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:46.946
They say there's another one.

700
00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:49.383
Someone
else in the house.

701
00:53:30.729 --> 00:53:31.686
Pathetic.

702
00:55:05.867 --> 00:55:08.087
It can take an
agonizing thirty minutes

703
00:55:08.087 --> 00:55:10.176
to bleed out from
a stab to the belly.

704
00:55:11.482 --> 00:55:13.788
Have fun bleeding out. asshole.

705
00:56:11.455 --> 00:56:12.281
Come on. come on!

706
00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:14.501
Come on. you assholes.
Get in the van!

707
00:56:14.501 --> 00:56:16.198
I'm in no mood to die tonight!

708
00:56:19.245 --> 00:56:20.725
-  Go! Go!

709
00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:32.432
Hugo. Shit.

710
00:56:37.742 --> 00:56:40.484
Fuck. fuck. fuck!

711
00:56:44.749 --> 00:56:46.925
Yeah. I need an extraction
at Hugo's house. now!

712
00:56:49.144 --> 00:56:51.582
<i>Echo sierra. Heading
in for Tac Air South.</i>

713
00:56:52.104 --> 00:56:54.933
<i>Zero. two. three. four.
formation alpha.</i>

714
00:56:55.237 --> 00:56:57.370
<i>E.T.A. nineteen minutes. Repeat</i>

715
00:56:57.762 --> 00:56:59.416
<i>E.T.A. nineteen minutes.</i>

716
00:57:06.379 --> 00:57:08.425
Fuck.

717
00:57:10.165 --> 00:57:14.474
Hang in there buddy.

718
00:57:28.749 --> 00:57:30.751
We got two stab wounds
in the abdomen. We gotta

719
00:57:30.751 --> 00:57:32.100
stop the blood
pressure. pulse is

720
00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:33.493
one twenty and threading.

721
00:57:33.493 --> 00:57:35.756
I want two large
boards with saline...

722
00:57:37.062 --> 00:57:38.585
<i>Where have you
been all week. Sam?</i>

723
00:57:38.846 --> 00:57:39.717
How is he?

724
00:57:41.109 --> 00:57:42.459
He's in the hospital.

725
00:57:42.459 --> 00:57:44.112
He's lost a lot of blood.

726
00:57:44.112 --> 00:57:45.244
It's not looking great.

727
00:57:47.028 --> 00:57:48.160
<i>Tell me you've not been
out there looking for Miro</i>

728
00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:49.030
<i>on your own.</i>

729
00:57:49.553 --> 00:57:50.379
I'm sorry.

730
00:57:51.772 --> 00:57:52.425
<i>Trying to make
up for my mistake.</i>

731
00:57:52.425 --> 00:57:53.644
It's not your fault.

732
00:57:53.644 --> 00:57:55.341
- You guys were outnumbered.

733
00:57:55.863 --> 00:57:57.169
They took you by surprise.

734
00:57:57.169 --> 00:57:58.605
Hell. you were lucky
to get out of there

735
00:57:58.605 --> 00:57:59.606
with your life.

736
00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:02.174
<i>This mission was doomed
from the beginning.</i>

737
00:58:02.174 --> 00:58:02.740
<i>It's time to come home.</i>

738
00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:03.741
<i>Regroup.</i>

739
00:58:04.132 --> 00:58:05.743
I called it off.

740
00:58:05.743 --> 00:58:07.527
Hugo's gone.

741
00:58:07.527 --> 00:58:08.920
And they know
about all of our agents

742
00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:10.225
in the system. including you.

743
00:58:10.225 --> 00:58:11.313
<i>But the
auction's tomorrow.</i>

744
00:58:13.098 --> 00:58:15.100
<i>We have no idea where.
You'd be going in blind.</i>

745
00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:16.275
- But--
-  <i>It's too dangerous.</i>

746
00:58:16.275 --> 00:58:17.668
- We have to--
-  <i>Our best bet</i>

747
00:58:17.929 --> 00:58:20.235
<i>is to use
our internal intel network</i>

748
00:58:20.758 --> 00:58:22.847
to track and see
who's buying Neely.

749
00:58:23.282 --> 00:58:24.849
Hopefully.
they don't kill him.

750
00:58:24.849 --> 00:58:26.328
and we can start
over from there.

751
00:58:26.546 --> 00:58:27.504
We have to get Miro.

752
00:58:28.722 --> 00:58:30.158
Miro was never the target.

753
00:58:30.158 --> 00:58:31.377
But. we have to get him.

754
00:58:31.377 --> 00:58:33.379
It's not your responsibility.

755
00:58:33.684 --> 00:58:36.164
Sam. you did a nice job

756
00:58:36.164 --> 00:58:37.949
for your first time out.

757
00:58:37.949 --> 00:58:39.298
but I'm gonna be
straight with you.

758
00:58:40.255 --> 00:58:41.169
You weren't ready.

759
00:58:45.913 --> 00:58:47.436
Yeah. yeah. You're. uh...

760
00:58:48.612 --> 00:58:49.961
You're right.

761
00:58:49.961 --> 00:58:51.049
It wasn't what I thought.

762
00:58:51.049 --> 00:58:53.747
It's messy and ruthless

763
00:58:54.487 --> 00:58:56.315
and completely terrifying.

764
00:58:57.446 --> 00:59:01.233
But. um. I know that now.

765
00:59:01.233 --> 00:59:02.582
And if you give me

766
00:59:02.582 --> 00:59:04.236
this chance.
I'll take care of it.

767
00:59:05.237 --> 00:59:06.804
They know we're coming.

768
00:59:07.326 --> 00:59:09.546
They suspect anything wrong.

769
00:59:09.546 --> 00:59:10.851
they'll move Neely.

770
00:59:10.851 --> 00:59:12.244
or they'll kill him.

771
00:59:13.332 --> 00:59:14.420
Then there goes

772
00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:16.161
all that intel
right out the window.

773
00:59:16.161 --> 00:59:17.336
But they're not going
to kill him

774
00:59:17.336 --> 00:59:18.163
because they need the money.

775
00:59:18.642 --> 00:59:20.034
You don't know that.

776
00:59:20.557 --> 00:59:23.124
So what? You're fine with Hugo
dying for nothing?

777
00:59:23.951 --> 00:59:26.171
Sam. I appreciate that

778
00:59:26.475 --> 00:59:28.086
you've learned
a great deal on this mission.

779
00:59:29.653 --> 00:59:30.958
but it's over.

780
00:59:31.219 --> 00:59:32.612
I've already
sent a car for you.

781
00:59:34.396 --> 00:59:36.137
<i>You know we've been
tracking you this whole time.</i>

782
00:59:36.921 --> 00:59:37.922
No. I'm staying.

783
00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:40.359
I'm not asking. Sam.

784
00:59:40.707 --> 00:59:41.926
That's an order.

785
00:59:42.404 --> 00:59:44.711
You get your ass back to H.Q.

786
00:59:45.059 --> 00:59:46.278
I can get to Miro.

787
00:59:46.844 --> 00:59:48.715
Son. you're not listening.

788
00:59:49.237 --> 00:59:51.152
That is not possible
at this time.

789
00:59:51.152 --> 00:59:52.240
<i>Whatever happened</i>

790
00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:53.633
to taking down
The Untouchables?

791
00:59:53.633 --> 00:59:55.374
- Goodbye. Sam.

792
00:59:56.331 --> 00:59:57.681
Jeez. that was brutal.

793
00:59:59.334 --> 01:00:00.684
Sometimes necessary.

794
01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:04.513
You think he's
going to go for it anyway?

795
01:00:05.819 --> 01:00:06.951
Well. see.

796
01:00:28.886 --> 01:00:30.931
God. you fucking stink.

797
01:00:30.931 --> 01:00:32.759
When was the last time
you took a shower? Christ.

798
01:00:32.759 --> 01:00:34.021
Took a shower?

799
01:00:34.021 --> 01:00:35.675
I've been stuck
in a fucking dog cage.

800
01:00:37.372 --> 01:00:38.765
He stinks.

801
01:00:39.374 --> 01:00:40.941
- Can we get him cleaned up?
-  Please?

802
01:00:40.941 --> 01:00:42.377
Of course.

803
01:00:42.682 --> 01:00:43.814
Anything specific

804
01:00:43.814 --> 01:00:45.163
you want him to wear
for the auction?

805
01:00:45.511 --> 01:00:47.339
Uh. Well.

806
01:00:47.339 --> 01:00:48.993
for the price
that's on his head.

807
01:00:48.993 --> 01:00:51.125
I think we should put him in
something nice.

808
01:00:51.125 --> 01:00:52.431
Maybe a tuxedo.

809
01:00:52.431 --> 01:00:54.738
- Yes. sir.
- And Daisy. wait.

810
01:00:54.738 --> 01:00:56.304
- Yeah?
- Uh...

811
01:00:57.044 --> 01:00:59.786
let's put a whistle
around his neck.

812
01:01:00.265 --> 01:01:01.701
- I'm on it.
-  How about that?

813
01:01:02.615 --> 01:01:04.748
Oh. yeah. They're going
to eat that shit up.

814
01:01:04.748 --> 01:01:05.749
Eat it up.

815
01:01:08.708 --> 01:01:11.319
I love it. The genius.

816
01:01:11.319 --> 01:01:12.059
Well?

817
01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:16.237
Hugo's dead.

818
01:01:18.326 --> 01:01:19.197
Good.

819
01:01:19.937 --> 01:01:21.460
There was another man.

820
01:01:21.852 --> 01:01:23.505
It was probably
his controller.

821
01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:26.030
He wasn't a much of a fighter.
And he ran away.

822
01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:31.035
He got away.

823
01:01:32.558 --> 01:01:34.473
On your watch.

824
01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:36.910
By the time he let's
The Collective know.

825
01:01:36.910 --> 01:01:39.217
and they find
a replacement and ship them out.

826
01:01:39.957 --> 01:01:41.567
We'll be long gone.

827
01:01:43.047 --> 01:01:44.744
How many men did you lose?

828
01:01:49.053 --> 01:01:50.837
Can you get more?

829
01:01:50.837 --> 01:01:52.796
-  Of course.
-  Good. I need more.

830
01:01:54.536 --> 01:01:55.537
Okay.

831
01:01:56.756 --> 01:01:57.670
Do you want me to go
after him?

832
01:01:57.670 --> 01:02:00.368
No. I don't. I want you here.

833
01:02:00.368 --> 01:02:01.543
for the auction.

834
01:02:01.543 --> 01:02:03.023
Double the security.

835
01:02:03.328 --> 01:02:05.504
And Nikita. if you see anyone
acting suspicious.

836
01:02:05.504 --> 01:02:07.724
just please.
just take them out.

837
01:02:08.202 --> 01:02:09.290
Understood.

838
01:03:11.222 --> 01:03:12.397
Gotcha.

839
01:03:52.045 --> 01:03:52.872
Shit.

840
01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:33.521
Well. I see you don't

841
01:04:33.521 --> 01:04:34.827
have a date. young man.

842
01:04:34.827 --> 01:04:37.003
Would you like to borrow one?

843
01:04:37.874 --> 01:04:40.180
- What?
- Would you like to borrow one?

844
01:04:41.747 --> 01:04:44.706
I'd go with the redhead. but
don't let me influence you.

845
01:04:47.535 --> 01:04:49.189
I don't need a date. Thank you.

846
01:04:51.844 --> 01:04:53.324
Because I was planning

847
01:04:53.324 --> 01:04:55.108
on purchasing one myself.

848
01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:58.111
This guy.

849
01:04:58.764 --> 01:05:00.461
Hey. man. Terence Madsen.

850
01:05:00.984 --> 01:05:02.376
What's your name. my friend?

851
01:05:02.376 --> 01:05:04.857
- George Lee.
- Lee?

852
01:05:04.857 --> 01:05:06.772
Well. I think I heard you.

853
01:05:06.772 --> 01:05:08.252
Oil. right?

854
01:05:08.252 --> 01:05:09.296
Among other things.

855
01:05:10.123 --> 01:05:10.819
Name?

856
01:05:11.298 --> 01:05:12.386
George Lee.

857
01:05:12.386 --> 01:05:14.911
George Lee.

858
01:05:17.739 --> 01:05:18.740
I got you.

859
01:05:19.219 --> 01:05:20.220
Welcome.

860
01:05:22.353 --> 01:05:23.136
Name?

861
01:05:23.354 --> 01:05:24.659
Terence Madsen.

862
01:05:24.659 --> 01:05:26.705
But you can call me any time.

863
01:05:27.314 --> 01:05:28.707
- Wait.

864
01:05:30.491 --> 01:05:32.276
In your ear. what is that?

865
01:05:32.624 --> 01:05:33.451
Uh.

866
01:05:34.278 --> 01:05:35.757
It's my hearing aid.

867
01:05:35.757 --> 01:05:36.671
Hearing aid?

868
01:05:37.846 --> 01:05:39.500
Is she giving you
a hard time. George?

869
01:05:41.024 --> 01:05:41.981
I don't know.

870
01:05:41.981 --> 01:05:43.940
Listen. I know him. He's cool.

871
01:05:47.639 --> 01:05:48.814
All right. I'm sorry.

872
01:05:48.814 --> 01:05:50.468
You can never be too careful.

873
01:05:50.816 --> 01:05:52.513
Enjoy your time. Mr. Lee.

874
01:05:52.513 --> 01:05:53.775
I will. Thank you.

875
01:05:58.563 --> 01:06:00.086
Now. where were we?

876
01:07:00.755 --> 01:07:03.106
Now. that's
how you tell a joke.

877
01:07:37.662 --> 01:07:40.708
George. you sitting
with us. or what?

878
01:07:44.321 --> 01:07:45.800
Yes. of course.

879
01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:47.106
Well. let's go then.

880
01:07:57.247 --> 01:07:59.162
So is this your first time
at one of these?

881
01:07:59.771 --> 01:08:01.773
No. it's not. You?

882
01:08:02.339 --> 01:08:04.732
Well. I've been twice. Obviously.

883
01:08:05.385 --> 01:08:06.821
-  Still haven't seen

884
01:08:06.821 --> 01:08:07.692
you around.

885
01:08:09.389 --> 01:08:10.564
Who do you know here?

886
01:08:12.044 --> 01:08:13.872
I was. uh. I was in business
with Barry Vanderstorm.

887
01:08:14.481 --> 01:08:16.266
Oh. shit.

888
01:08:16.701 --> 01:08:18.094
I'm sorry.

889
01:08:18.094 --> 01:08:19.834
You know. I really didn't
know him very well.

890
01:08:20.183 --> 01:08:21.706
- It's okay.
- No. no. no. no.

891
01:08:21.706 --> 01:08:23.142
It's fucked up
how they got him

892
01:08:23.142 --> 01:08:24.143
in the leak.

893
01:08:25.275 --> 01:08:27.103
You must be pissed
at Neely. huh?

894
01:08:28.626 --> 01:08:29.453
Yeah.

895
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:34.066
You thinking of buying him?

896
01:08:34.806 --> 01:08:35.981
If the price is right.

897
01:08:38.375 --> 01:08:40.072
I should introduce
you to Miro.

898
01:08:41.595 --> 01:08:42.683
No. that's not nece--

899
01:08:42.683 --> 01:08:44.076
No. no. no. no. Listen.

900
01:08:44.076 --> 01:08:45.904
I mean. you were close
with Barry. after all.

901
01:08:46.209 --> 01:08:48.080
That's not a problem. Come on.

902
01:08:49.081 --> 01:08:52.040
That's a good one.

903
01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:55.174
- You're killing me.
- Sir.

904
01:08:56.741 --> 01:08:58.525
Yes. What? Yes.

905
01:08:58.525 --> 01:08:59.744
Terence Madsen.

906
01:08:59.744 --> 01:09:01.528
I have bought
some of your finest.

907
01:09:01.528 --> 01:09:04.618
Madsen. Madsen. I remember
you. Madsen.

908
01:09:05.010 --> 01:09:05.880
Good to see you. sir.

909
01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:07.621
How are you? How are they?

910
01:09:08.187 --> 01:09:11.582
They have never been better.

911
01:09:11.582 --> 01:09:13.845
This here is my friend.
George Lee.

912
01:09:15.977 --> 01:09:19.981
Yes. Mr. George. I'm sorry.

913
01:09:20.373 --> 01:09:23.333
Yeah. I was a friend
of Barry Vanderstorms.

914
01:09:24.856 --> 01:09:26.684
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

915
01:09:26.684 --> 01:09:29.339
I'm terrible with faces.
but. um.

916
01:09:29.339 --> 01:09:31.210
yeah. it's good to see you.

917
01:09:33.081 --> 01:09:35.519
George is thinking of

01:24:13.874 --> 01:24:15.398
that's well done.

1096
01:24:15.398 --> 01:24:16.573
Thank you.

1097
01:24:17.617 --> 01:24:19.489
Still plenty of work
to do around here.

1098
01:24:20.011 --> 01:24:22.318
Sam. What did I tell
you about grenades?

1099
01:24:24.972 --> 01:24:27.410
You blew up my motherfucking
house. Sam!

1100
01:24:27.801 --> 01:24:29.281
Yeah. I...

1101
01:24:30.978 --> 01:24:32.284
Relax. Hugo.

1102
01:24:32.632 --> 01:24:34.939
You can always
buy another house.

1103
01:24:34.939 --> 01:24:38.073
We'll talk about that a little
bit more before our

1104
01:24:38.551 --> 01:24:39.726
next mission.

1105
01:24:40.118 --> 01:24:40.945
Yeah?

1106
01:24:47.212 --> 01:24:48.474
It happens.
