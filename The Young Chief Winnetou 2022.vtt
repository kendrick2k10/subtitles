YOUNG WINNETOU AND THE LOST BUFFALOS

4
00:01:13.542 --> 00:01:15.459
Let's go! Guys. hurry!

5
00:01:17.917 --> 00:01:19.167
Go. Ennito!

6
00:01:20.876 --> 00:01:22.584
Come on! Faster!

7
00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.251
We have to catch up to them.

8
00:01:28.834 --> 00:01:30.501
Go!

9
00:01:34.417 --> 00:01:36.292
Hurry!

10
00:01:47.876 --> 00:01:49.334
That way!

11
00:01:49.584 --> 00:01:51.334
-Hey!
-Move!

12
00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:56.376
Keep going!

13
00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:02.001
Careful.

14
00:02:03.584 --> 00:02:06.042
Hurry up! Go on. Nscho-tschi.

15
00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:08.792
-We can do it!
-Taza's nearly here. Faster!

16
00:02:10.876 --> 00:02:13.126
Yes. Now you.

17
00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:18.459
Careful. Tokala!

18
00:02:24.251 --> 00:02:25.292
Come on.

19
00:02:28.292 --> 00:02:30.167
This time we'll win!

20
00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:33.167
Come on. guys!

21
00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.792
No!

22
00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.917
Taza missed the target.

23
00:03:24.084 --> 00:03:27.376
But he didn't abandon his companions.

24
00:03:38.126 --> 00:03:40.209
A single arrow...

25
00:03:42.584 --> 00:03:44.417
breaks easily.

26
00:03:49.251 --> 00:03:50.917
Many arrows...

27
00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:56.376
are unbreakable.

28
00:03:57.834 --> 00:03:59.959
They are stronger together.

29
00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:05.459
Go. the warriors are returning
from the hunt.

30
00:04:08.126 --> 00:04:09.792
Winnetou.

31
00:04:16.042 --> 00:04:17.667
I see

32
00:04:17.917 --> 00:04:21.584
that you have a burning desire
inside you to lead others.

33
00:04:22.334 --> 00:04:25.042
Perhaps even to become chief.

34
00:04:29.917 --> 00:04:33.542
Like the moth
that flies close to the fire.

35
00:04:34.334 --> 00:04:38.001
a chief-to-be also has to learn
to restrain himself.

36
00:04:39.584 --> 00:04:43.917
He must put the welfare of his tribe
before his own.

37
00:04:44.834 --> 00:04:49.376
And his decisions
must ensure peace within the community.

38
00:04:50.792 --> 00:04:55.209
But how am I to know
whether a decision is right or wrong?

39
00:04:59.751 --> 00:05:01.334
Trust your heart.

40
00:05:35.834 --> 00:05:37.334
Your chief...

41
00:05:38.792 --> 00:05:40.917
returns empty-handed.

42
00:05:42.792 --> 00:05:47.667
The buffalos that roam our hunting
grounds during the falling leaf moon

43
00:05:49.792 --> 00:05:52.084
did not come.

44
00:05:52.251 --> 00:05:53.834
On our long hunt

45
00:05:54.001 --> 00:05:55.834
we were unable to make a kill.

46
00:05:56.001 --> 00:05:59.917
How will we survive the Long Night Moon
without meat or hides?

47
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:05.292
The council will decide
what is to be done.

48
00:06:18.792 --> 00:06:20.626
I'm glad to see you again.

49
00:06:20.876 --> 00:06:22.792
What happened to the buffalos?

50
00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:25.042
They can't have just vanished.

51
00:06:25.209 --> 00:06:28.459
Did you look for traces of them
off their usual route?

52
00:06:28.626 --> 00:06:30.126
-Maybe...
-My son.

53
00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:31.876
I mean...

54
00:06:34.751 --> 00:06:37.501
I sent people
to gather agave. dates and nuts.

55
00:06:37.751 --> 00:06:41.792
Thanks. my friend.
Have Ish-kay-nay go on night watch.

56
00:06:44.626 --> 00:06:47.126
I can go on night watch. I'm rested.

57
00:06:47.376 --> 00:06:49.459
It is a task for seasoned warriors.

58
00:06:49.626 --> 00:06:52.542
But I'm as skilled
as older tribespeople.

59
00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:55.292
And... I'm the son of the chief.

60
00:06:55.459 --> 00:06:58.834
And you think that alone
makes you a seasoned warrior?

61
00:06:59.084 --> 00:07:01.167
-I just want to help.
-Fine.

62
00:07:02.126 --> 00:07:04.292
I'll give you a task.

63
00:07:05.126 --> 00:07:06.167
Great!

64
00:07:13.417 --> 00:07:15.459
There's another one.

65
00:07:17.042 --> 00:07:18.126
And there!

66
00:07:26.459 --> 00:07:29.334
What's wrong?
It is a very honorable task.

67
00:07:29.501 --> 00:07:32.584
If you leave the turds
more buttercups grow...

68
00:07:32.834 --> 00:07:36.501
I thought Father would give me
a more important task.

69
00:07:37.209 --> 00:07:39.334
He may not think you're ready.

70
00:07:47.751 --> 00:07:49.959
Then I'll prove it to him.

71
00:08:01.584 --> 00:08:02.917
Winnetou?

72
00:08:03.167 --> 00:08:07.626
-Why are you not in your tent?
-My father sent me to relieve you.

73
00:08:07.876 --> 00:08:09.834
-But Nagi-nita said...
-I know.

74
00:08:10.376 --> 00:08:13.792
He changed his mind.
You can go and rest.

75
00:09:12.459 --> 00:09:14.292
Let go. horse thief!

76
00:09:46.292 --> 00:09:47.709
Hey!

77
00:10:31.917 --> 00:10:33.542
Stop!

78
00:10:33.792 --> 00:10:35.126
Oops.

79
00:10:38.917 --> 00:10:40.626
Okay. let's agree...

80
00:10:41.126 --> 00:10:42.751
to call it a draw?

81
00:10:48.376 --> 00:10:51.042
Come on. I just wanted to pet the horse.

82
00:10:53.834 --> 00:10:55.959
Tying me up is a bit much.

83
00:10:56.792 --> 00:10:58.667
Come on!

84
00:11:00.334 --> 00:11:02.292
Oops. I...

85
00:11:02.459 --> 00:11:04.376
think there's a fire over there.

86
00:11:06.876 --> 00:11:08.292
Fire!

87
00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:10.459
Our stores!

88
00:11:10.709 --> 00:11:11.834
Fire!

89
00:11:12.792 --> 00:11:13.834
Fire!

90
00:11:17.334 --> 00:11:20.792
-Go! Get water from the river now!
-Go! It's burning.

91
00:11:24.334 --> 00:11:25.834
Hello. Chief...

92
00:11:27.834 --> 00:11:29.876
-Who is he?
-I'm Tom Silver.

93
00:11:30.042 --> 00:11:33.042
And this is all just a misunderstanding.

94
00:11:58.667 --> 00:12:00.792
You lied to Ish-kay-nay.

95
00:12:01.417 --> 00:12:04.251
What's worse.
you didn't sound the alarm.

96
00:12:04.417 --> 00:12:08.542
-I thought I'd manage alone.
-Your false pride cost us our stores.

97
00:12:08.709 --> 00:12:13.167
And now. when the buffalos didn't come
and winter is approaching!

98
00:12:13.334 --> 00:12:17.126
You are far from ready
to take responsibility for your tribe.

99
00:12:17.876 --> 00:12:19.667
And now for you...

100
00:12:25.334 --> 00:12:29.042
I won't stain my ancestors' land
with a white man's blood

101
00:12:29.542 --> 00:12:32.251
and endanger our peace treaty.

102
00:12:33.709 --> 00:12:36.709
Winnetou.
we will hand the horse thief over

103
00:12:36.959 --> 00:12:39.001
to the sheriff.

104
00:12:39.251 --> 00:12:41.417
He's your responsibility till then.

105
00:12:41.584 --> 00:12:44.834
-But. Chief...
-Go into the teepee with him.

106
00:12:45.084 --> 00:12:48.334
I don't want to see or hear you
until the next moon.

107
00:13:05.376 --> 00:13:08.251
The council shall meet
in the holy caves.

108
00:13:32.334 --> 00:13:34.251
Um... girl.

109
00:13:34.501 --> 00:13:37.334
I'd love the food.
I'm as hungry as a bear.

110
00:13:41.292 --> 00:13:44.751
You don't look like a bear.
but like a dead possum

111
00:13:45.001 --> 00:13:47.292
that's been out in the sun too long.

112
00:13:51.251 --> 00:13:54.209
I've thought it over.
I'm not hungry after all.

113
00:13:55.417 --> 00:13:57.417
But thanks... girl.

114
00:13:57.917 --> 00:13:59.542
-Nscho-tschi.
-Bless you.

115
00:14:00.626 --> 00:14:03.251
That's my name. I'm Winnetou's sister.

116
00:14:03.417 --> 00:14:05.584
Oh. I'm sorry. Nice to meet you.

117
00:14:05.751 --> 00:14:07.167
Tom Silver.

118
00:14:08.167 --> 00:14:10.626
Stay away from him. He's a thief.

119
00:14:11.584 --> 00:14:13.334
Is he always so grumpy?

120
00:14:17.167 --> 00:14:21.376
Father wouldn't be so furious
if the buffalos hadn't vanished.

121
00:14:21.626 --> 00:14:23.667
He will forgive you.

122
00:14:25.876 --> 00:14:29.876
-But I won't forgive myself.
-What's going on with the buffalos?

123
00:14:30.042 --> 00:14:32.042
The herd comes through each year

124
00:14:32.209 --> 00:14:34.042
on its way to the Big Water.

125
00:14:34.209 --> 00:14:36.834
But this year they still haven't come.

126
00:14:37.792 --> 00:14:40.042
And if I knew where they were?

127
00:14:40.292 --> 00:14:43.417
-I may have heard something.
-What did you hear?

128
00:14:43.667 --> 00:14:47.667
-Where? From whom?
-Some scraps. from a drunk in a saloon.

129
00:14:47.917 --> 00:14:50.084
What's his name? And what's a "saloon"?

130
00:14:51.084 --> 00:14:53.917
Untie me and I'll take you there.

131
00:14:57.209 --> 00:14:58.792
No. Winnetou.

132
00:14:59.042 --> 00:15:01.292
Speak to Father.

133
00:15:31.334 --> 00:15:33.459
Don't even think about it.

134
00:15:36.667 --> 00:15:38.792
All right. I understand.

135
00:15:48.501 --> 00:15:50.876
I can't see the buffalos.

136
00:15:52.667 --> 00:15:54.876
A shadow hovers over them.

137
00:15:57.876 --> 00:16:00.251
A shadow shaped like a bird.

138
00:16:01.917 --> 00:16:03.334
An eagle...

139
00:16:04.334 --> 00:16:05.917
or perhaps...

140
00:16:08.042 --> 00:16:09.167
Yes.

141
00:16:09.334 --> 00:16:10.959
a big crow.

142
00:16:13.334 --> 00:16:15.209
The signs are clear.

143
00:16:16.042 --> 00:16:17.542
A curse.

144
00:16:19.376 --> 00:16:21.167
We should break camp.

145
00:16:22.792 --> 00:16:25.042
This land is tied to our people.

146
00:16:25.959 --> 00:16:28.917
Many of our ancestors
are laid to rest here.

147
00:16:30.751 --> 00:16:35.626
Who will watch over their graves
and our holy caves if we leave?

148
00:16:37.876 --> 00:16:41.292
And yet the future of our tribe
has much more weight

149
00:16:41.459 --> 00:16:43.501
than the past does.

150
00:16:46.292 --> 00:16:50.376
Without the buffalos we will not survive
the Long Night Moon.

151
00:16:52.751 --> 00:16:54.542
Nagi-nita is right.

152
00:16:56.126 --> 00:16:58.251
The survival of our people

153
00:16:58.792 --> 00:17:00.709
is the first priority.

154
00:17:14.334 --> 00:17:18.501
If the buffalos haven't returned
once the moon is half its size

155
00:17:18.667 --> 00:17:20.542
we will break camp...

156
00:17:22.167 --> 00:17:24.084
-And seek new land.
-No!

157
00:17:29.709 --> 00:17:31.584
You dare disrupt the council?

158
00:17:32.709 --> 00:17:36.459
Father. we don't
have to leave our homeland.

159
00:17:36.709 --> 00:17:39.209
The boy may know where the buffalos are.

160
00:17:46.084 --> 00:17:50.167
Winnetou trusts the wrong person.
The white man only has one goal.

161
00:17:50.417 --> 00:17:52.917
He comes with guns and rifles
to steal our land.

162
00:17:53.167 --> 00:17:56.126
-But what if he can help us?
-Enough!

163
00:17:56.667 --> 00:17:58.834
Nagi-nita is right.

164
00:17:59.001 --> 00:18:03.042
The boy is two-faced
and only wants to save his own skin.

165
00:18:03.292 --> 00:18:06.126
You've let me down
for the second time today.

166
00:18:06.292 --> 00:18:07.417
Go!

167
00:18:07.667 --> 00:18:09.251
Back to your teepee.

168
00:18:15.876 --> 00:18:19.542
Post a guard outside
so he doesn't leave it again.

169
00:18:48.834 --> 00:18:50.959
Where are you going?

170
00:18:52.292 --> 00:18:54.209
To the white man's country?

171
00:18:54.376 --> 00:18:56.792
It is dangerous to go there.

172
00:18:56.959 --> 00:19:00.001
Why don't we ask
an older warrior to go with us?

173
00:19:00.251 --> 00:19:02.417
-Us?
-I'm coming along.

174
00:19:02.667 --> 00:19:06.459
No. I've been banished
from Father's sight. he won't miss me.

175
00:19:06.709 --> 00:19:09.876
If you go. he'll notice
and send warriors after you.

176
00:19:10.126 --> 00:19:12.292
-But...
-I hate to admit it.

177
00:19:12.542 --> 00:19:15.417
Your brother may possibly even be right.

178
00:19:15.959 --> 00:19:17.792
Will you untie me now?

179
00:19:27.292 --> 00:19:30.376
Oh. come on! Really? What is this?

180
00:19:31.751 --> 00:19:34.292
Once I find that man. I'll set you free.

181
00:19:39.042 --> 00:19:40.876
We have to get past the guard.

182
00:19:48.959 --> 00:19:51.334
Here. You have to drink this.

183
00:20:14.084 --> 00:20:17.334
No. Mommy. I've already eaten it all up.

184
00:20:17.501 --> 00:20:21.001
-What's with him?
-The "kiss of the silver frog."

185
00:20:21.167 --> 00:20:23.792
It loosens the tongue while you sleep.

186
00:20:24.042 --> 00:20:26.917
I have more.
Here. it may be of use to you.

187
00:20:38.501 --> 00:20:41.126
Nothing against good old laholo.

188
00:20:41.376 --> 00:20:45.959
but I think one of your faster horses
would have been a better idea.

189
00:20:47.209 --> 00:20:49.709
But. all right. it's your decision.

190
00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:54.542
This will get us to Rio Santo
in five hours at the earliest.

191
00:20:57.792 --> 00:21:00.376
You don't like to talk. do you?

192
00:21:02.042 --> 00:21:04.167
Oh well. you don't have to be.

193
00:21:04.876 --> 00:21:07.042
-I can shut my trap.
-Hm?

194
00:21:07.209 --> 00:21:10.334
By "shut my trap"
I mean I can keep quiet.

195
00:21:10.501 --> 00:21:13.334
After all. we don't know each other.

196
00:21:14.501 --> 00:21:16.084
Hardly. that is.

197
00:21:18.917 --> 00:21:21.376
I hate to say it. but...

198
00:21:22.042 --> 00:21:23.792
I have to pee...

199
00:21:24.834 --> 00:21:27.251
Well. all right. That's fine.

200
00:21:27.501 --> 00:21:29.667
I'll just let go.

201
00:21:47.917 --> 00:21:49.292
-Done?
-Yes.

202
00:21:49.542 --> 00:21:51.251
Yes. yes. I'm done.

203
00:21:51.876 --> 00:21:54.626
Sure is hot. without a hat and all.

204
00:21:56.876 --> 00:21:59.209
So do Natives sweat. or don't they?

205
00:22:00.792 --> 00:22:02.709
Do pale faces bleed.

206
00:22:03.334 --> 00:22:05.042
or don't they?

207
00:22:06.501 --> 00:22:08.126
Let's ride.

208
00:22:10.292 --> 00:22:14.126
Is it true that all your names
have a meaning?

209
00:22:19.001 --> 00:22:21.501
If so. what does Winnetou mean?

210
00:22:22.251 --> 00:22:24.126
“"Angry wolf"?

211
00:22:24.376 --> 00:22:26.334
Or "moody eagle”?

212
00:22:26.917 --> 00:22:29.126
-Or maybe...
-Burning water.

213
00:22:29.292 --> 00:22:32.876
Huh? But... But water can't burn.

214
00:22:35.459 --> 00:22:38.126
But it sounds pretty cool somehow.

215
00:23:03.251 --> 00:23:06.584
-Saloon'll know where the buffalos are.
-Saloon isn't a man.

216
00:23:06.834 --> 00:23:09.334
That's the place where the man is.

217
00:23:09.501 --> 00:23:11.834
-His name is Hank.
-Then let's go.

218
00:23:12.084 --> 00:23:14.209
-Let's look for Hank.
-Hold on.

219
00:23:14.376 --> 00:23:17.709
Maybe it'd be better
if I go into the saloon alone.

220
00:23:18.501 --> 00:23:21.834
Natives aren't exactly...
How should I say this?

221
00:23:22.001 --> 00:23:23.209
Welcome.

222
00:23:29.959 --> 00:23:32.334
Do you have a better idea?

223
00:23:46.251 --> 00:23:47.376
Howdy.

224
00:23:47.542 --> 00:23:50.626
He's a horse thief.
I caught him in the act.

225
00:23:56.667 --> 00:23:58.709
Don't go too far. got it?

226
00:24:00.126 --> 00:24:02.876
Good Lord!
How long is this going to take?

227
00:24:04.459 --> 00:24:06.626
-This sun is unbearable.
-Mom!

228
00:24:06.876 --> 00:24:10.084
Look! A Native. if I'm not mistaken.

229
00:24:10.751 --> 00:24:13.417
Sam Hawkens. don't talk nonsense again!

230
00:24:13.584 --> 00:24:15.126
But...

231
00:24:18.167 --> 00:24:22.584
Good that we're just passing through.
Now come along.

232
00:24:26.334 --> 00:24:27.959
That's that boy!

233
00:24:28.209 --> 00:24:29.376
Come on!

234
00:24:38.626 --> 00:24:40.042
Thanks.

235
00:25:03.042 --> 00:25:05.251
Hey! What's this supposed to be?

236
00:25:07.084 --> 00:25:09.459
Who's that you've got with you?

237
00:25:12.959 --> 00:25:15.251
Ah! There you are. finally.

238
00:25:18.209 --> 00:25:21.459
What? They're here to help in the barn.

239
00:25:23.792 --> 00:25:26.917
-Continue!
-But don't steal any hens!

240
00:25:29.417 --> 00:25:32.126
Where's your sense?
Showing up with your friend!

241
00:25:32.626 --> 00:25:34.501
We're not friends!

242
00:25:43.001 --> 00:25:44.667
Oh. come here.

243
00:25:49.876 --> 00:25:52.542
Tom. Rio Santo is dangerous.

244
00:25:53.292 --> 00:25:56.001
Lots of people
have scores to settle with you.

245
00:25:56.251 --> 00:25:59.876
We're getting out of here soon.
but first you have to help us.

246
00:26:00.126 --> 00:26:03.209
-Do you know where Hank is?
-That old rascal?

247
00:26:05.126 --> 00:26:07.709
He's in the back
trying his luck at poker.

248
00:26:07.959 --> 00:26:10.876
-You foolish liar!
-Oh. no.

249
00:26:18.001 --> 00:26:20.209
-Hank.
-That's him.

250
00:26:20.459 --> 00:26:23.042
Cheating at poker isn't a good idea.

251
00:26:23.292 --> 00:26:25.876
-Hey. I wasn't cheating.
-Come on.

252
00:26:26.417 --> 00:26:28.834
-The money!
-I didn't do anything.

253
00:26:33.542 --> 00:26:35.626
Oh. that dummy.

254
00:26:42.667 --> 00:26:44.417
Go! Under the table!

255
00:26:49.834 --> 00:26:51.334
Kiss me!

256
00:26:57.792 --> 00:26:59.709
I love you anyway.

257
00:27:03.626 --> 00:27:05.792
-He's trying to escape.
-After him!

258
00:27:06.959 --> 00:27:08.834
Go on. give me the rifle.

259
00:27:09.667 --> 00:27:11.501
Thank you.

260
00:27:13.459 --> 00:27:14.959
Enough!

261
00:27:18.251 --> 00:27:20.251
Well. there you go.

262
00:27:26.334 --> 00:27:28.209
Where is he?

263
00:27:29.792 --> 00:27:31.459
Up there!

264
00:27:33.209 --> 00:27:34.709
Weapons first.

265
00:27:34.959 --> 00:27:36.292
Seriously?

266
00:27:38.292 --> 00:27:39.792
Let's go.

267
00:27:42.334 --> 00:27:43.959
Come on. honey.

268
00:27:48.667 --> 00:27:50.417
Do you see this?

269
00:27:50.584 --> 00:27:52.251
This Tom...

270
00:27:52.501 --> 00:27:54.126
Silver.

271
00:27:54.292 --> 00:27:57.001
He was just slinking through town.

272
00:27:57.542 --> 00:28:00.292
With a Native. if I'm not mistaken.

273
00:28:01.126 --> 00:28:02.209
Ridley!

274
00:28:02.459 --> 00:28:03.667
Wilson!

275
00:28:06.417 --> 00:28:08.209
-And Ridley?
-No idea. Watson.

276
00:28:08.459 --> 00:28:10.834
Todd's little weasel is in town.

277
00:28:36.751 --> 00:28:37.792
Well?

278
00:28:37.959 --> 00:28:41.292
No idea
where Todd's little beagle is hiding.

279
00:28:42.584 --> 00:28:45.834
-His weasel. bonehead.
-Oh yeah?

280
00:28:46.001 --> 00:28:48.417
He has to be somewhere. Keep looking!

281
00:28:48.584 --> 00:28:50.084
Sure. boss.

282
00:28:52.251 --> 00:28:54.501
This is sure to mean trouble.

283
00:28:54.751 --> 00:28:57.417
Okay. he has to be
in one of these rooms.

284
00:29:00.126 --> 00:29:02.167
Hank? Oops.

285
00:29:02.917 --> 00:29:04.834
Sorry. Carry on.

286
00:29:10.334 --> 00:29:11.667
Okay.

287
00:29:12.584 --> 00:29:14.209
Nobody's in.

288
00:29:18.626 --> 00:29:20.501
Hank. old boy.

289
00:29:20.751 --> 00:29:22.251
What's up?

290
00:29:23.667 --> 00:29:25.001
Tom Silver!

291
00:29:26.792 --> 00:29:29.167
God. you scared me. What do you want?

292
00:29:30.209 --> 00:29:31.876
And who's that guy?

293
00:29:50.626 --> 00:29:54.417
Well. even if I knew
what happened with the buffalos.

294
00:29:55.251 --> 00:29:56.959
why should I tell you?

295
00:29:57.209 --> 00:29:59.501
It's quite a story indeed.

296
00:30:00.334 --> 00:30:02.292
He knows something.

297
00:30:04.751 --> 00:30:06.626
What do I get for telling you?

298
00:30:06.876 --> 00:30:10.667
I can imagine the guys in the saloon
want their money back.

299
00:30:11.251 --> 00:30:13.417
The money you stole from them.

300
00:30:13.584 --> 00:30:16.167
Come on. Winnetou. We're leaving.

301
00:30:16.709 --> 00:30:19.001
Crap! Tom.

302
00:30:19.167 --> 00:30:20.667
Wait.

303
00:30:21.709 --> 00:30:25.126
Okay. I'll tell you everything I know.

304
00:30:26.251 --> 00:30:28.001
But you won't like it.

305
00:30:35.542 --> 00:30:38.751
-Silver!
-Holy cow!

306
00:30:39.001 --> 00:30:41.626
Can't a guy have a bath in peace?

307
00:30:41.876 --> 00:30:45.542
First those two snot-nosed kids
and now you!

308
00:30:45.792 --> 00:30:47.876
Pardon me. Mayor.

309
00:30:56.959 --> 00:30:58.751
Boss!

310
00:31:05.084 --> 00:31:07.584
Todd... Aunt Todd's behind this.

311
00:31:08.292 --> 00:31:10.292
Yep. Looks that way.

312
00:31:11.209 --> 00:31:14.167
-Who is this woman?
-Todd isn't a woman.

313
00:31:14.667 --> 00:31:17.792
And I recommend
you to never ever call him...

314
00:31:18.292 --> 00:31:19.376
"aunt.”

315
00:31:19.626 --> 00:31:22.542
He's the most-wanted outlaw
in the Wild West.

316
00:31:22.792 --> 00:31:24.667
So you know him?

317
00:31:25.417 --> 00:31:28.834
Well. Todd and his gang
were like a family to Tom.

318
00:31:30.959 --> 00:31:32.834
That's right. isn't it?

319
00:31:34.126 --> 00:31:36.459
Right then. I've got to go.

320
00:31:38.042 --> 00:31:41.292
I wish you lots of luck.
You're going to need it.

321
00:31:51.417 --> 00:31:53.126
-Hello. gentlemen.
-Hello.

322
00:31:53.376 --> 00:31:54.876
Shut up!

323
00:31:55.917 --> 00:31:58.501
You have to bring me to this Todd fella.

324
00:31:58.959 --> 00:32:01.084
You know where to find him.

325
00:32:05.209 --> 00:32:06.251
Okay.

326
00:32:08.709 --> 00:32:11.709
I did what I could. That was the deal.

327
00:32:12.292 --> 00:32:13.376
Let's go.

328
00:32:13.626 --> 00:32:14.626
Come on.

329
00:32:19.459 --> 00:32:21.917
-What do they want?
-You may have missed it.

330
00:32:22.167 --> 00:32:23.542
I'm a thief.

331
00:32:23.792 --> 00:32:25.959
He wants to throw me in jail!

332
00:32:26.209 --> 00:32:27.584
Quick!

333
00:32:28.709 --> 00:32:30.626
Just you wait...

334
00:32:34.876 --> 00:32:36.584
Watch out!

335
00:32:36.834 --> 00:32:38.459
Darn it!

336
00:32:38.626 --> 00:32:41.876
Wait! That way! Cut them off.

337
00:32:57.959 --> 00:32:59.584
Wake up. sleepyhead!

338
00:32:59.751 --> 00:33:02.334
-This way!
-Don't let him get away!

339
00:33:08.876 --> 00:33:10.292
Crap!

340
00:33:12.667 --> 00:33:14.459
Go! In there.

341
00:33:14.626 --> 00:33:16.834
Why are you staring at the roof?

342
00:33:17.084 --> 00:33:19.626
They came down a while ago. darn it.

343
00:33:43.376 --> 00:33:45.417
Robbery!

344
00:33:46.126 --> 00:33:47.751
My wagon!

345
00:33:58.042 --> 00:34:01.251
Don't stand around like statues.
do something!

346
00:34:04.042 --> 00:34:05.709
They're in there!

347
00:34:06.209 --> 00:34:07.792
On the horses!

348
00:34:17.584 --> 00:34:20.834
This is going to be exciting.
if I'm not mistaken.

349
00:34:28.376 --> 00:34:31.376
I hate to ask.
but you do have a plan. right?

350
00:34:34.334 --> 00:34:37.167
-We have to control the horses.
-How?

351
00:34:37.417 --> 00:34:39.251
Without reins?

352
00:34:39.626 --> 00:34:41.376
We have to stop somehow.

353
00:34:51.542 --> 00:34:52.542
Crap!

354
00:34:58.417 --> 00:34:59.834
Faster. boys.

355
00:35:00.542 --> 00:35:02.876
The sheriff and his men are after us.

356
00:35:21.376 --> 00:35:23.167
-Oh. crap!
-What is it?

357
00:35:24.667 --> 00:35:26.167
Whoa!

358
00:35:27.001 --> 00:35:30.709
-What's wrong. boss?
-They're headed for Akuna Canyon.

359
00:35:30.959 --> 00:35:33.542
Then that's that for Tom Silver.

360
00:35:33.709 --> 00:35:35.709
Did I ask you?

361
00:35:42.126 --> 00:35:44.001
We have to jump off.

362
00:35:45.167 --> 00:35:48.167
-No way!
-Then we get on the horses!

363
00:35:59.334 --> 00:36:01.376
He's out of his mind!

364
00:36:08.417 --> 00:36:10.501
On three. we jump!

365
00:36:13.209 --> 00:36:14.959
One...

366
00:36:15.792 --> 00:36:17.417
-Two...
-No!

367
00:36:18.167 --> 00:36:19.917
Three!

368
00:36:57.626 --> 00:36:58.834
Jump!

369
00:36:59.084 --> 00:37:00.626
Winnetou!

370
00:37:00.876 --> 00:37:03.417
The wagon will fall off the cliff.

371
00:37:04.459 --> 00:37:05.834
Give me your hand!

372
00:37:10.376 --> 00:37:12.126
Now!

373
00:37:14.501 --> 00:37:15.917
No!

374
00:37:16.459 --> 00:37:18.209
I can't do it.

375
00:37:33.167 --> 00:37:35.042
We have to jump!

376
00:37:35.292 --> 00:37:38.084
-No. I can't!
-You have to! Come on!

377
00:37:38.251 --> 00:37:39.792
-No way!
-Now! Jump!

378
00:38:29.417 --> 00:38:31.501
Rest in peace. Tom Silver.

379
00:38:32.959 --> 00:38:35.042
-Shame.
-That's for sure.

380
00:38:35.292 --> 00:38:38.209
-I hoped he would lead us to Todd.
-Oh. right.

381
00:38:39.209 --> 00:38:41.167
I meant about the wagon.

382
00:38:44.167 --> 00:38:45.459
Okay. fellas.

383
00:38:46.251 --> 00:38:48.001
Let's ride back.

384
00:39:15.834 --> 00:39:17.584
You can come out.

385
00:40:19.709 --> 00:40:21.876
How does that work?

386
00:40:26.834 --> 00:40:29.792
The sun's setting.
Where can we camp tonight?

387
00:40:29.959 --> 00:40:31.917
No clue. How should I know?

388
00:40:32.167 --> 00:40:34.584
Because this is your region.

389
00:40:34.959 --> 00:40:37.917
And another thing. you're bleeding.

390
00:41:14.167 --> 00:41:16.376
Take another roasted mescal.

391
00:41:16.626 --> 00:41:18.459
I've had three. I'm full.

392
00:41:19.334 --> 00:41:23.126
Take them to the teepee
for Winnetou and the white boy.

393
00:41:23.834 --> 00:41:26.334
Yes. I'll take some with me.

394
00:41:29.126 --> 00:41:30.834
Thank you. Father.

395
00:41:31.751 --> 00:41:33.834
Winnetou made a mistake.

396
00:41:34.667 --> 00:41:36.584
But he is still young.

397
00:41:37.084 --> 00:41:39.167
His blood runs hot quickly.

398
00:41:39.417 --> 00:41:41.417
He has a big task ahead of him.

399
00:41:43.751 --> 00:41:46.001
I'm not sure if he's up to it.

400
00:41:46.584 --> 00:41:50.459
Perhaps you should
put more trust in him.

401
00:41:56.959 --> 00:41:58.751
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

402
00:42:09.501 --> 00:42:11.209
I'm so mad!

403
00:42:12.001 --> 00:42:13.209
Mad?

404
00:42:13.376 --> 00:42:16.001
By mad she means angry.

405
00:42:16.709 --> 00:42:19.876
The sheriff said that you were dead.

406
00:42:20.042 --> 00:42:23.001
So he won't search for us anymore.
We're alive.

407
00:42:23.876 --> 00:42:25.751
You don't need to be mad.

408
00:42:28.501 --> 00:42:30.001
Yes.

409
00:42:31.584 --> 00:42:33.834
You're safe here for tonight.

410
00:42:43.292 --> 00:42:45.042
You are quiet.

411
00:42:45.459 --> 00:42:47.501
That is... new.

412
00:42:52.292 --> 00:42:54.001
Thanks.

413
00:42:54.626 --> 00:42:57.167
Thank you for saving me.

414
00:42:57.792 --> 00:43:00.251
You didn't have to do that.

415
00:43:01.834 --> 00:43:03.667
You ride by my side.

416
00:43:07.292 --> 00:43:09.959
That symbol on your amulet...

417
00:43:10.209 --> 00:43:12.376
is that gold?

418
00:43:13.417 --> 00:43:15.334
If so. it's worth a lot.

419
00:43:15.501 --> 00:43:18.584
If it were stone
it wouldn't be worth any less to me.

420
00:43:18.751 --> 00:43:20.667
Does it have a meaning?

421
00:43:20.834 --> 00:43:22.459
It's from my father.

422
00:43:23.084 --> 00:43:26.709
He got it as a young man
to honor his bravery.

423
00:43:26.876 --> 00:43:28.959
What did he do?

424
00:43:29.209 --> 00:43:33.876
He freed a woman who had fallen
into a deep crevice during the hunt.

425
00:43:34.042 --> 00:43:36.751
The woman... was your mother?

426
00:43:39.501 --> 00:43:41.709
What happened to her?

427
00:43:41.876 --> 00:43:44.542
She died a few years ago.

428
00:43:50.334 --> 00:43:51.667
And you?

429
00:43:51.917 --> 00:43:54.042
What about your family?

430
00:43:58.751 --> 00:44:00.251
My parents...

431
00:44:00.417 --> 00:44:02.292
I never met them.

432
00:44:03.209 --> 00:44:06.084
They vanished when I was still little.

433
00:44:07.334 --> 00:44:09.459
And Todd took me in.

434
00:44:11.001 --> 00:44:12.959
Then. about a year ago.

435
00:44:13.542 --> 00:44:15.167
during a robbery.

436
00:44:15.834 --> 00:44:19.709
I was supposed to sound the alarm
when the sheriff showed up.

437
00:44:19.959 --> 00:44:21.751
But I messed it up.

438
00:44:22.292 --> 00:44:24.126
And during the getaway

439
00:44:24.792 --> 00:44:26.459
we got separated.

440
00:44:26.626 --> 00:44:30.876
And why didn't you go back
to that Todd guy afterwards?

441
00:44:38.292 --> 00:44:41.209
What about this woman who's mad?

442
00:44:43.292 --> 00:44:46.459
-Miss Elly. What about her?
-She likes you.

443
00:44:47.042 --> 00:44:48.542
Nonsense.

444
00:44:48.709 --> 00:44:52.042
She thinks I'm a bandit.
like everyone else does.

445
00:44:53.542 --> 00:44:55.167
We say.

446
00:44:55.334 --> 00:44:58.542
"Judge not by the eye.
but by the heart.”

447
00:45:06.501 --> 00:45:08.334
I know where to find Todd.

448
00:45:08.501 --> 00:45:10.667
And I'll take you to him.

449
00:45:28.459 --> 00:45:32.417
-Nscho-tschi.
-Wait! It's best you don't go in there.

450
00:45:32.917 --> 00:45:34.417
Why?

451
00:45:34.667 --> 00:45:37.001
Winnetou and the white boy are sick.

452
00:45:37.167 --> 00:45:39.876
I had them try my bearberry tea.

453
00:45:40.126 --> 00:45:43.417
It made Ish-kay-nay think
she was a flying fire salamander.

454
00:45:43.667 --> 00:45:45.709
Yes. That's exactly right.

455
00:45:57.626 --> 00:45:59.209
See?

456
00:45:59.376 --> 00:46:01.334
They are sound asleep.

457
00:46:24.417 --> 00:46:26.167
What's going on here?

458
00:46:26.834 --> 00:46:28.709
Where are they?

459
00:46:40.626 --> 00:46:42.292
Your first time bareback.

460
00:46:42.542 --> 00:46:46.084
-Nonsense! Why do you ask?
-It wasn't a question.

461
00:46:46.959 --> 00:46:48.626
Drink.

462
00:47:03.084 --> 00:47:06.584
Here. We call this is aloe vera.
Rub it on the raw spot.

463
00:47:06.834 --> 00:47:08.084
What?

464
00:47:08.251 --> 00:47:10.459
No idea what you mean. I'm fine.

465
00:47:28.959 --> 00:47:31.501
How much further till we get to Todd?

466
00:47:31.667 --> 00:47:35.167
If we get a move on.
we'll be there before sundown.

467
00:47:35.417 --> 00:47:37.167
Let's go then.

468
00:47:43.167 --> 00:47:46.459
You can make a million
with this miracle cure.

469
00:47:47.876 --> 00:47:50.959
Winnetou and the white boy
rode to Rio Santo.

470
00:47:52.042 --> 00:47:55.167
He defied my orders. as did Nscho-tschi.

471
00:48:01.917 --> 00:48:03.709
My son must return.

472
00:48:04.459 --> 00:48:07.084
Our tribe is not leaving until he does.

473
00:48:07.917 --> 00:48:10.542
We'll ride now. and we will find him.

474
00:48:16.042 --> 00:48:19.584
Do you see?
Back there in that ramshackle hut.

475
00:48:19.751 --> 00:48:22.584
That's where Todd and his gang hide.

476
00:48:22.834 --> 00:48:24.626
Then we have to go there.

477
00:49:11.042 --> 00:49:13.876
-Are you the sheriff?
-That's Wilson.

478
00:49:14.042 --> 00:49:16.334
Sheriff Watson.

479
00:49:17.959 --> 00:49:20.542
-We come in peace.
-I sure hope so.

480
00:49:21.334 --> 00:49:24.126
-What do you want?
-Intschu-tschuna sent us.

481
00:49:24.667 --> 00:49:27.126
We're looking for his son. Winnetou.

482
00:49:27.376 --> 00:49:28.876
Winne who?

483
00:49:30.626 --> 00:49:33.459
-He was with a white boy.
-Tom Silver.

484
00:49:34.542 --> 00:49:38.417
-You saw them?
-Tom Silver is guilty of many crimes.

485
00:49:38.667 --> 00:49:43.834
While fleeing the law he
and the other boy stole a covered wagon.

486
00:49:44.709 --> 00:49:46.417
The two of them...

487
00:49:46.917 --> 00:49:48.584
God rest their souls.

488
00:49:48.751 --> 00:49:50.626
fell off a cliff.

489
00:49:50.792 --> 00:49:52.876
-Before our eyes.
-Where?

490
00:49:54.251 --> 00:49:56.001
Into Akuna Canyon.

491
00:50:05.167 --> 00:50:08.084
Tell Intschu-tschuna.
I'll ride to the canyon.

492
00:50:17.209 --> 00:50:19.542
This is sure to mean trouble.

493
00:50:28.542 --> 00:50:29.834
You okay?

494
00:50:31.042 --> 00:50:33.542
What's that face you're making. Freddy?

495
00:50:33.709 --> 00:50:35.751
If I could make faces...

496
00:50:36.417 --> 00:50:38.626
I'd fix you up with a new one.

497
00:50:39.834 --> 00:50:41.542
Would you really?

498
00:50:42.751 --> 00:50:44.667
Butch. Freddy. two of Todd's men.

499
00:50:45.167 --> 00:50:46.542
Thanks.

500
00:50:46.792 --> 00:50:49.542
Not exactly the brightest guys around.

501
00:50:49.709 --> 00:50:52.042
-We have to ask them...
-Stop!

502
00:50:52.209 --> 00:50:54.001
They're dangerous.

503
00:50:54.542 --> 00:50:56.334
I have a better plan.

504
00:51:53.626 --> 00:51:57.376
An underground tunnel here
leads into Todd's hideout.

505
00:51:57.542 --> 00:52:00.209
It's meant as an escape route. Come on.

506
00:52:03.126 --> 00:52:04.626
Let's go.

507
00:52:25.459 --> 00:52:26.959
Whoa! Hot!

508
00:52:28.542 --> 00:52:30.917
Oh. yummy. You hungry too?

509
00:52:33.167 --> 00:52:35.584
Watching you cook ruins my appetite.

510
00:53:01.126 --> 00:53:04.417
-What's the deal with that?
-I'm training.

511
00:53:05.209 --> 00:53:07.501
It'd do you some good too. buddy.

512
00:53:09.167 --> 00:53:11.167
Go on.

513
00:53:11.334 --> 00:53:13.542
-Hit me.
-What?

514
00:53:13.709 --> 00:53:15.417
Punch me!

515
00:53:15.584 --> 00:53:17.417
Why? You're my friend.

516
00:53:17.667 --> 00:53:19.584
No matter.

517
00:53:20.667 --> 00:53:23.126
As hard as you can. Come on!

518
00:53:42.626 --> 00:53:45.584
Call me when the food's ready.
Okay. Butch?

519
00:53:46.584 --> 00:53:49.126
We have to get them to talk.

520
00:53:55.626 --> 00:53:59.917
-The kiss of the silver frog.
-It loosens the tongue while you sleep.

521
00:54:06.209 --> 00:54:08.001
Okay. I've got this.

522
00:54:44.709 --> 00:54:46.876
Freddy! Food's ready.

523
00:55:15.292 --> 00:55:16.334
Stop!

524
00:55:19.834 --> 00:55:21.917
Didn't you forget something?

525
00:55:28.209 --> 00:55:32.292
You're a bandit. I'm a bandit.
now it's time to eat

526
00:55:32.542 --> 00:55:34.959
so we wish you: Bon Appétit!

527
00:56:01.251 --> 00:56:02.751
What now?

528
00:56:09.292 --> 00:56:11.751
Shut up. you stupid animal!

529
00:56:12.334 --> 00:56:14.959
Can't you do anything besides poo?

530
00:56:17.126 --> 00:56:20.959
All of Devil's Gorge
stinks worse than our outhouse.

531
00:56:23.251 --> 00:56:24.751
Devil's Gorge.

532
00:56:43.376 --> 00:56:45.042
You airheads.

533
00:56:45.292 --> 00:56:50.376
What is it now?
What for crow's sake is wrong with you?

534
00:56:50.626 --> 00:56:52.501
No idea. Todd.

535
00:56:57.167 --> 00:56:58.709
Shh!

536
00:56:59.459 --> 00:57:01.251
-You hear that?
-What?

537
00:57:24.376 --> 00:57:25.584
Let's go.

538
00:57:25.834 --> 00:57:27.709
Sorry. Buffalo allergy.

539
00:57:33.584 --> 00:57:37.709
If all goes as planned.
our pals will leave their land.

540
00:57:45.959 --> 00:57:48.001
Knock yourselves out for a few hours.

541
00:57:53.542 --> 00:57:55.042
Seriously?

542
00:57:56.542 --> 00:57:58.501
You're such a fool.

543
00:58:06.751 --> 00:58:09.667
Okay. now we know
where the buffalos are.

544
00:58:09.834 --> 00:58:12.917
In Devil's Gorge.
And I know where it is.

545
00:58:13.084 --> 00:58:15.584
We'll free them tomorrow morning.

546
00:58:29.209 --> 00:58:30.917
Is everything okay?

547
00:58:33.042 --> 00:58:37.667
My mind told me not to trust you.
but I followed my heart.

548
00:58:41.876 --> 00:58:43.376
Thank you.

549
00:59:21.917 --> 00:59:23.751
Hey. my darling.

550
00:59:24.501 --> 00:59:27.042
What do you have to chitter to me?

551
01:00:19.542 --> 01:00:21.251
The buffalos.

552
01:00:21.417 --> 01:00:22.917
There they are.

553
01:00:33.292 --> 01:00:34.792
You did it.

554
01:00:36.209 --> 01:00:37.251
We.

555
01:00:44.667 --> 01:00:47.251
Come on. Let's free the buffalos.

556
01:00:58.959 --> 01:01:00.917
Oopsy-poopsy.

557
01:01:03.542 --> 01:01:05.501
What a coincidence!

558
01:01:11.251 --> 01:01:12.751
Tom Silver.

559
01:01:14.001 --> 01:01:15.959
Back with the family.

560
01:01:17.334 --> 01:01:20.834
He's not involved in this.
I forced him to lead me here.

561
01:01:22.334 --> 01:01:24.834
Always so gallant. these young people.

562
01:01:29.917 --> 01:01:31.584
Tom.

563
01:01:32.959 --> 01:01:36.376
I can't start to tell you
how disappointed I am in you

564
01:01:36.542 --> 01:01:39.751
after everything I have done for you.

565
01:01:40.376 --> 01:01:41.876
Hold on.

566
01:01:42.459 --> 01:01:44.292
I'm disappointed.

567
01:01:44.459 --> 01:01:47.417
I thought you guys would never show up.

568
01:01:49.709 --> 01:01:53.334
What are you saying?
You know what this looks like to us?

569
01:01:53.501 --> 01:01:55.792
As if you led this guy here

570
01:01:56.042 --> 01:01:57.626
to free the buffalos.

571
01:01:57.792 --> 01:01:59.584
What? Nonsense!

572
01:01:59.751 --> 01:02:03.167
When I heard about your genius plan
to hide the buffalos.

573
01:02:03.417 --> 01:02:05.709
I latched right on to this guy

574
01:02:05.876 --> 01:02:08.667
to stop him from freeing the buffalos.

575
01:02:12.292 --> 01:02:15.251
Listen. Todd. I know I screwed up.

576
01:02:15.501 --> 01:02:17.042
Back then.

577
01:02:17.292 --> 01:02:20.084
and I want to make up for that mistake.

578
01:02:21.542 --> 01:02:23.709
I brought him here on purpose.

579
01:02:23.959 --> 01:02:25.917
to you. as a present.

580
01:02:27.417 --> 01:02:29.292
You like presents.

581
01:02:30.334 --> 01:02:32.376
Who doesn't like presents?

582
01:02:33.209 --> 01:02:35.876
But what am I supposed to do with him?

583
01:02:36.126 --> 01:02:39.209
I don't care. He's just the packaging.

584
01:02:44.167 --> 01:02:47.042
-This is your actual present.
-Gold!

585
01:02:48.917 --> 01:02:50.292
Traitor!

586
01:02:50.542 --> 01:02:51.959
I trusted you.

587
01:02:52.126 --> 01:02:55.209
Yeah. sure.
And you listened to your heart.

588
01:02:56.001 --> 01:02:57.709
You guys are so stupid.

589
01:03:00.126 --> 01:03:02.792
And. by the way. he's not just anyone.

590
01:03:03.042 --> 01:03:07.209
This is Winnetou.
son of the Apache chief Intschu-tschuna.

591
01:03:19.126 --> 01:03:22.084
Well. well. the son of a chief.

592
01:03:26.126 --> 01:03:27.167
Sorry

593
01:03:27.417 --> 01:03:30.417
that you have to leave your land.

594
01:03:30.959 --> 01:03:33.334
but we want the gold

595
01:03:33.501 --> 01:03:35.251
from your holy caves.

596
01:03:43.209 --> 01:03:45.167
I missed you. Tom.

597
01:03:45.334 --> 01:03:48.626
I'm glad to be back here.
with my family.

598
01:03:52.459 --> 01:03:53.959
Disarm him.

599
01:03:57.751 --> 01:04:00.042
All right. pal. get moving!

600
01:04:05.334 --> 01:04:08.709
You'll pay for this!
My father will send warriors.

601
01:04:09.209 --> 01:04:11.292
-Hey!
-Does he always jabber so much?

602
01:04:11.459 --> 01:04:15.584
Unceasingly! He nearly talked me
to death on the way here.

603
01:04:33.126 --> 01:04:34.584
Oh. boy!

604
01:04:35.334 --> 01:04:37.834
Home cooking always tastes best.

605
01:05:01.709 --> 01:05:03.709
Oopsy-poopsy.

606
01:05:05.042 --> 01:05:07.917
-What an esteemed visitor!
-Nagi-nita!

607
01:05:08.626 --> 01:05:11.084
Our good friend Nia-Gara.

608
01:05:13.917 --> 01:05:17.876
Come. sit down with us
and tell us what brings you here.

609
01:05:18.126 --> 01:05:20.084
I kept my part of the deal.

610
01:05:20.834 --> 01:05:23.792
We'll leave our land
and search for a new home.

611
01:05:24.584 --> 01:05:27.001
I want the weapons you promised me.

612
01:05:27.167 --> 01:05:29.167
You'll get your weapons.

613
01:05:29.417 --> 01:05:33.751
We have an agreement.
but first we want the gold...

614
01:05:34.667 --> 01:05:36.959
from your holy caves.

615
01:05:37.126 --> 01:05:40.751
Then you'll have fulfilled
your part of the agreement.

616
01:05:46.959 --> 01:05:48.459
Winnetou.

617
01:05:49.042 --> 01:05:51.084
my chief's son. is dead.

618
01:05:51.334 --> 01:05:54.959
He fell off a cliff
while fleeing the sheriff.

619
01:05:56.417 --> 01:05:59.042
-Oh! How unfortunate.
-Shut it!

620
01:05:59.292 --> 01:06:01.709
How horrible. How sad.

621
01:06:11.667 --> 01:06:15.126
But. in all honesty.
what are you trying to tell us?

622
01:06:16.917 --> 01:06:21.459
His death will confirm my tribe's belief
that our land is cursed.

623
01:06:22.417 --> 01:06:26.167
Once I bring Intschu-tschuna proof.
he will give the order

624
01:06:26.417 --> 01:06:27.959
to break camp.

625
01:06:28.209 --> 01:06:29.709
Hallelujah!

626
01:06:30.251 --> 01:06:33.584
Then this tragic accident
has a silver lining.

627
01:06:35.001 --> 01:06:38.126
So. off you go. back to your village.

628
01:06:38.751 --> 01:06:42.334
And away you go
to seek new lands in peace.

629
01:06:51.209 --> 01:06:53.626
Anything else. Tiki-Taka?

630
01:06:57.667 --> 01:07:00.584
Intschu-tschuna is
a distinguished chief.

631
01:07:01.959 --> 01:07:05.834
But he fails to see that the pale faces
will soon break the peace.

632
01:07:06.792 --> 01:07:10.667
We can only defend ourselves
against the white man's weapons

633
01:07:10.917 --> 01:07:12.876
with your guns.

634
01:07:15.084 --> 01:07:19.292
We know you only want
what's best for your people. as do we.

635
01:07:19.542 --> 01:07:22.501
the best for you.
as well as for ourselves.

636
01:07:25.126 --> 01:07:27.709
The agreement was no bloodshed.

637
01:07:29.376 --> 01:07:32.042
We will. of course. hold to that.

638
01:07:38.126 --> 01:07:40.251
We. the Crow family.

639
01:07:41.417 --> 01:07:43.126
are men of honor.

640
01:08:00.959 --> 01:08:03.209
Butch. Freddy.

641
01:08:03.459 --> 01:08:05.667
Get rid of that Winnetou boy.

642
01:08:07.584 --> 01:08:10.251
And by "get rid of"
you mean what exactly?

643
01:08:12.167 --> 01:08:13.751
Tom.

644
01:08:13.917 --> 01:08:15.834
Explain it to him.

645
01:08:18.001 --> 01:08:19.792
Eliminate him.

646
01:08:31.751 --> 01:08:33.251
Right. boy.

647
01:08:42.042 --> 01:08:43.709
I'm really sorry. kiddo.

648
01:08:44.626 --> 01:08:46.417
This really does suck.

649
01:08:46.667 --> 01:08:48.584
But you heard Todd's order.

650
01:08:48.834 --> 01:08:52.584
and when he... you know...
no one dares to...

651
01:08:52.834 --> 01:08:55.792
-No one disagrees with him.
-Butch?

652
01:09:03.501 --> 01:09:06.917
Are you sure
that you really want to shoot him?

653
01:09:08.292 --> 01:09:10.001
But...

654
01:09:10.167 --> 01:09:12.834
-But Todd said...
-I know what he said.

655
01:09:13.001 --> 01:09:15.876
"Eliminate him." but not like this!

656
01:09:16.667 --> 01:09:17.959
How then?

657
01:09:18.209 --> 01:09:20.584
-He's messing with you.
-Fine.

658
01:09:21.751 --> 01:09:23.667
Bump him off. I don't care.

659
01:09:23.917 --> 01:09:26.292
Todd will get you defying his order.

660
01:09:28.042 --> 01:09:30.084
Breathe. Butch.

661
01:09:31.376 --> 01:09:34.042
-What would you do. Tom?
-Think about it.

662
01:09:34.292 --> 01:09:36.667
Over the cliff. Glug. glug!

663
01:09:37.209 --> 01:09:39.876
Into the water. so his soul is trapped

664
01:09:40.042 --> 01:09:42.626
and his ghost can't haunt his killers.

665
01:09:42.792 --> 01:09:45.042
But you know that.

666
01:09:46.626 --> 01:09:48.292
Of course we do.

667
01:09:48.542 --> 01:09:49.876
Yeah.

668
01:09:50.042 --> 01:09:52.376
Of course. How dumb do you think we are?

669
01:09:53.417 --> 01:09:55.042
Right. let's go.

670
01:10:01.959 --> 01:10:03.709
Enjoy the trip!

671
01:10:21.542 --> 01:10:23.042
Don't worry.

672
01:10:23.792 --> 01:10:25.417
We're nearly there.

673
01:10:34.376 --> 01:10:36.126
Stop whining!

674
01:10:37.459 --> 01:10:40.001
He's thrashing around like a trout.

675
01:10:40.251 --> 01:10:43.126
-Give me the bag.
-Do you know how bad it hurts?

676
01:10:44.459 --> 01:10:46.417
You little maggot!

677
01:10:46.667 --> 01:10:49.417
Right. bud. enough funny business.

678
01:11:03.501 --> 01:11:05.251
Gold. gold. gold!

679
01:11:05.417 --> 01:11:06.917
I'm coming!

680
01:11:17.334 --> 01:11:18.626
Well...

681
01:11:18.792 --> 01:11:20.709
Any last words?

682
01:11:22.417 --> 01:11:24.667
Right. then on... on three.

683
01:11:25.792 --> 01:11:27.709
-One...
-Nah.

684
01:12:55.792 --> 01:12:58.292
Winnetou!
If this is some stupid trick...

685
01:12:58.542 --> 01:13:00.209
Stop it!

686
01:13:01.292 --> 01:13:02.792
Please!

687
01:13:22.167 --> 01:13:24.084
Come on! Breathe!

688
01:13:25.584 --> 01:13:26.667
Breathe!

689
01:13:28.917 --> 01:13:30.584
Please!

690
01:13:31.292 --> 01:13:32.376
Breathe!

691
01:13:40.251 --> 01:13:41.542
Winnetou.

692
01:13:46.417 --> 01:13:47.626
Winnetou.

693
01:13:49.042 --> 01:13:50.542
My friend.

694
01:14:00.626 --> 01:14:02.292
Winnetou.

695
01:14:02.542 --> 01:14:05.417
You're alive! I can't believe it.

696
01:14:05.667 --> 01:14:07.876
You really scared me.

697
01:14:08.626 --> 01:14:11.001
Oh. boy. Everything's all right.

698
01:14:12.751 --> 01:14:16.751
I'm sorry I betrayed you.
It was our only chance.

699
01:14:17.251 --> 01:14:19.334
I had to pretend I was on his side.

700
01:14:19.501 --> 01:14:21.667
I wanted... Otherwise he'd have...

701
01:14:21.917 --> 01:14:24.001
I don't know what to say.

702
01:14:24.876 --> 01:14:26.667
Then just shut your trap.

703
01:14:31.626 --> 01:14:35.126
My heart spoke the truth.
Well done. my friend.

704
01:14:37.167 --> 01:14:40.584
We'll free the buffalos later.
We've got to go.

705
01:14:40.834 --> 01:14:42.834
Before Todd gets our gold.

706
01:14:43.334 --> 01:14:46.126
-Where are the horses?
-Over there. Wait!

707
01:15:13.376 --> 01:15:15.542
I learn fast.

708
01:15:18.126 --> 01:15:19.751
First my wife.

709
01:15:20.542 --> 01:15:22.459
and now my son Winnetou.

710
01:15:24.376 --> 01:15:25.876
I'm sorry.

711
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:29.584
I wish I could bring you better news.

712
01:15:31.042 --> 01:15:33.792
But. unfortunately. there's no doubt.

713
01:15:41.042 --> 01:15:42.667
Thank you. brother.

714
01:15:49.042 --> 01:15:50.917
We will leave this land.

715
01:16:06.126 --> 01:16:07.626
Hallelujah!

716
01:16:07.792 --> 01:16:10.959
The Apaches are breaking camp.

717
01:16:12.876 --> 01:16:15.209
The path to our gold is wide open.

718
01:16:28.209 --> 01:16:29.417
Faster!

719
01:16:31.084 --> 01:16:32.334
Faster!

720
01:16:35.001 --> 01:16:36.626
Come on. faster!

721
01:16:58.459 --> 01:17:01.417
-We can't waste any time.
-My brother is alive.

722
01:17:01.584 --> 01:17:03.709
I can feel it.

723
01:17:17.334 --> 01:17:19.167
We have to be strong

724
01:17:19.334 --> 01:17:22.334
and think about
the future of our people.

725
01:17:25.751 --> 01:17:27.584
Your father is waiting.

726
01:17:44.167 --> 01:17:46.126
You're sure you want to stay here?

727
01:17:50.209 --> 01:17:53.084
You will lead our people to new land.

728
01:17:53.876 --> 01:17:57.501
And you will ensure
that we can live in peace.

729
01:19:39.292 --> 01:19:41.792
What are you doing on our land?

730
01:19:46.959 --> 01:19:48.834
Oopsy-poopsy!

731
01:19:49.001 --> 01:19:51.626
To whom do we owe the pleasure?

732
01:19:54.251 --> 01:19:56.042
Who even cares?

733
01:20:00.792 --> 01:20:04.084
This is no longer your land. but ours.

734
01:20:07.626 --> 01:20:09.251
Tie them up.

735
01:20:54.542 --> 01:20:56.209
Faster!

736
01:21:15.751 --> 01:21:17.376
You'll pay for this.

737
01:21:18.834 --> 01:21:20.751
Our warriors will find you.

738
01:21:21.459 --> 01:21:23.501
-And avenge us.
-Funny.

739
01:21:24.834 --> 01:21:28.709
That's exactly
what that boy Winnetou said.

740
01:21:31.001 --> 01:21:35.251
shortly before taking leave
for the happy hunting grounds.

741
01:21:44.751 --> 01:21:47.709
-So?
-We will have to wait for Nita-nagi.

742
01:21:48.167 --> 01:21:50.376
The caves are mazelike.

743
01:21:51.001 --> 01:21:53.501
We'll never find the gold alone.

744
01:21:53.667 --> 01:21:55.584
-Do you have to go wee?
-Mm-hmm.

745
01:21:56.751 --> 01:21:59.751
How many times have I told you to go wee

746
01:21:59.917 --> 01:22:02.209
before we ride off?

747
01:22:03.417 --> 01:22:05.292
-Go on now.
-Thanks.

748
01:22:07.876 --> 01:22:09.042
Children.

749
01:22:12.251 --> 01:22:14.292
I want my gold now.

750
01:22:16.042 --> 01:22:18.626
You could lead me through this cave.

751
01:22:18.876 --> 01:22:20.917
We would rather die

752
01:22:21.834 --> 01:22:24.834
than show you the way through the caves.

753
01:22:28.792 --> 01:22:31.042
How gallant and dignified.

754
01:22:34.542 --> 01:22:36.251
There he is. finally!

755
01:22:36.417 --> 01:22:38.542
Our faithful friend.

756
01:22:40.584 --> 01:22:42.334
In case you haven't met yet.

757
01:22:42.501 --> 01:22:44.292
Nia-Gara. old people.

758
01:22:44.459 --> 01:22:46.501
Old people. Nia-Gara.

759
01:22:46.667 --> 01:22:48.084
Oh. who cares?

760
01:22:55.417 --> 01:22:57.542
Where are the weapons you promised?

761
01:23:00.126 --> 01:23:02.751
-Dear friend. about the weapons...
-Hands up!

762
01:23:15.042 --> 01:23:16.459
Nscho-tschi!

763
01:23:18.209 --> 01:23:20.209
No! Let me go!

764
01:23:28.334 --> 01:23:32.626
You pretty. brave little girl.
we don't do things like that.

765
01:23:36.334 --> 01:23:37.667
You just wait!

766
01:23:40.501 --> 01:23:42.459
Run! Run and get help!

767
01:23:50.251 --> 01:23:52.584
The next shot will be on target!

768
01:23:57.959 --> 01:23:59.417
Get her.

769
01:24:04.167 --> 01:24:05.376
Nagi-nagi.

770
01:24:05.626 --> 01:24:07.709
always short and snappy.

771
01:24:09.626 --> 01:24:11.751
Who is going to finally lead me

772
01:24:12.501 --> 01:24:14.459
to my gold?

773
01:24:15.876 --> 01:24:17.667
-You!
-I'll do it.

774
01:24:19.876 --> 01:24:21.459
I'll do it.

775
01:24:24.626 --> 01:24:26.751
Hallelujah. Delightful.

776
01:24:27.251 --> 01:24:30.042
Go on. Follow along. go on.

777
01:24:32.584 --> 01:24:34.251
Foley. you too.

778
01:24:38.876 --> 01:24:40.376
Onward!

779
01:25:11.584 --> 01:25:14.626
I've always wanted
to try one of these out.

780
01:25:21.376 --> 01:25:23.292
Winnetou. you're alive.

781
01:25:23.542 --> 01:25:27.167
If we don't make it. tell my father
the buffalos are in Devil's Gorge.

782
01:25:29.001 --> 01:25:30.417
Thanks.

783
01:25:31.917 --> 01:25:33.584
-Let's go.
-Okay.

784
01:25:46.501 --> 01:25:49.709
Nscho-tschi. Have you seen Nscho-tschi?

785
01:25:51.584 --> 01:25:53.167
Nscho-tschi?

786
01:26:10.876 --> 01:26:12.376
Granny.

787
01:26:12.542 --> 01:26:14.667
why have you stopped walking?

788
01:26:15.167 --> 01:26:18.084
Should Achoo-Achoo give you a piggyback?

789
01:26:25.292 --> 01:26:27.917
Go on. Keep moving. Keep moving!

790
01:26:32.792 --> 01:26:35.292
When will we finally be there?

791
01:26:38.209 --> 01:26:39.917
Don't fall asleep.

792
01:26:41.501 --> 01:26:43.251
Keep moving.

793
01:26:44.334 --> 01:26:46.001
Go on.

794
01:26:49.209 --> 01:26:50.376
Wait!

795
01:26:53.501 --> 01:26:54.542
Seriously?

796
01:27:04.209 --> 01:27:07.084
- I could get used to this.
-Come on. let's go.

797
01:27:19.751 --> 01:27:21.251
Oopsy-poopsy.

798
01:27:22.709 --> 01:27:24.209
Hallelujah!

799
01:27:26.209 --> 01:27:27.709
Foley!

800
01:27:29.209 --> 01:27:30.834
Look at this.

801
01:27:31.751 --> 01:27:33.876
The Apache gold!

802
01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:38.126
Fo...!

803
01:27:41.501 --> 01:27:42.917
Foley?

804
01:27:45.209 --> 01:27:46.667
Foley!

805
01:27:49.001 --> 01:27:50.584
I knew it.

806
01:27:55.834 --> 01:27:57.334
Tom.

807
01:27:58.417 --> 01:28:01.334
All of the walls are full of gold!

808
01:28:03.876 --> 01:28:05.084
Winnetou.

809
01:28:05.334 --> 01:28:07.084
-I'll do this.
-Full of gold!

810
01:28:08.834 --> 01:28:10.584
All of the walls!

811
01:28:12.001 --> 01:28:13.501
Really?

812
01:28:16.834 --> 01:28:20.084
The Apache gold.

813
01:28:30.584 --> 01:28:32.126
Tom!

814
01:28:34.959 --> 01:28:37.167
There you are. It's about time.

815
01:28:38.001 --> 01:28:39.751
Take a look at this.

816
01:28:42.251 --> 01:28:44.167
Pure gold.

817
01:28:44.917 --> 01:28:49.042
This isn't like
sifting scraps out of the river.

818
01:28:52.459 --> 01:28:54.292
And it all belongs to me.

819
01:28:55.626 --> 01:28:58.167
Maybe I'll give my favorite son some.

820
01:28:59.459 --> 01:29:01.584
I'm not your son!

821
01:29:16.042 --> 01:29:19.084
You nasty. filthy. little...

822
01:29:26.959 --> 01:29:28.042
Winnetou!

823
01:29:28.959 --> 01:29:30.709
Winnetou!

824
01:29:31.459 --> 01:29:32.834
We did it!

825
01:29:33.084 --> 01:29:34.667
Come. quick!

826
01:29:34.917 --> 01:29:36.917
You have to look at this.

827
01:29:37.084 --> 01:29:38.584
Tom...

828
01:29:38.834 --> 01:29:40.876
you trait...

829
01:29:48.751 --> 01:29:52.501
One arrow breaks easily.
many arrows are stronger together.

830
01:29:53.376 --> 01:29:54.959
Thanks. my friend.

831
01:30:11.459 --> 01:30:12.751
Nscho-tschi.

832
01:30:15.626 --> 01:30:18.042
I was so afraid of losing you too.

833
01:30:28.417 --> 01:30:30.001
I was right.

834
01:30:31.334 --> 01:30:33.001
Right about what?

835
01:30:37.667 --> 01:30:38.876
Winnetou.

836
01:30:48.084 --> 01:30:49.209
Winnetou.

837
01:30:49.959 --> 01:30:51.459
You're alive.

838
01:31:19.626 --> 01:31:21.626
Look at that.

839
01:31:21.792 --> 01:31:24.167
That's what family looks like.

840
01:31:26.834 --> 01:31:28.501
Silly guy.

841
01:32:02.501 --> 01:32:04.584
The buffalos are back.

842
01:32:27.792 --> 01:32:29.584
Nagi-nita

843
01:32:30.167 --> 01:32:33.001
thought weapons would bring peace.

844
01:32:34.667 --> 01:32:38.542
But what he believed was wrong.
The opposite is true.

845
01:32:44.751 --> 01:32:49.001
Todd and his bandits
have been handed over to the sheriff.

846
01:33:04.209 --> 01:33:06.417
Winnetou. my son...

847
01:33:07.459 --> 01:33:09.001
I did you wrong.

848
01:33:09.167 --> 01:33:12.334
Actions are
what set a good warrior apart.

849
01:33:12.584 --> 01:33:17.959
-Thanks to you. the buffalos are back.
-The credit goes to someone else.

850
01:33:18.126 --> 01:33:22.584
To the person who saved my life
and who saved our tribe.

851
01:33:22.751 --> 01:33:24.751
Me? Aw. shucks.

852
01:33:24.917 --> 01:33:27.917
We all did that together.

853
01:33:28.084 --> 01:33:29.209
Nscho-tschi...

854
01:33:31.917 --> 01:33:34.709
One day you will be
a great chief. my son.

855
01:33:53.751 --> 01:33:55.334
Tom. look.

856
01:34:00.626 --> 01:34:02.584
Miss Elly.

857
01:34:07.792 --> 01:34:09.084
Tom Silver.

858
01:34:09.667 --> 01:34:11.959
the Great Spirit sent you to us.

859
01:34:12.126 --> 01:34:13.334
Yeah.

860
01:34:13.501 --> 01:34:18.584
To show us not to mistrust people
because their skin is a different color.

861
01:34:19.876 --> 01:34:21.792
Our eyes can deceive us.

862
01:34:22.042 --> 01:34:23.959
but not our heart.

863
01:34:25.292 --> 01:34:26.876
Thank you.

864
01:34:27.126 --> 01:34:29.084
We owe you great thanks.

865
01:34:45.501 --> 01:34:49.709
Elly. are you sure you want
to take that boy home. to my town?

866
01:34:50.501 --> 01:34:52.251
Yes. absolutely.

867
01:34:53.376 --> 01:34:56.626
-This is sure to mean trouble.
-Oh. Sheriff.

868
01:35:01.084 --> 01:35:02.959
Todd cried like a baby

869
01:35:03.126 --> 01:35:05.209
when I took it away from him.

870
01:35:45.459 --> 01:35:47.167
Blood brothers.

871
01:35:47.334 --> 01:35:48.834
Blood brothers.

872
01:35:50.126 --> 01:35:54.334
My brother. there will always be
a place for you by our fires.

873
01:36:02.251 --> 01:36:03.959
We will meet again.

874
01:36:14.626 --> 01:36:17.167
THE END

875
