Good boy.

2
00:01:26.487 --> 00:01:27.653
Aw.

Watch it. Watch it.

Frank. no.

5
00:01:36.097 --> 00:01:37.830
Told you not to do that.

6
00:01:37.832 --> 00:01:39.598
- Spare any change?
- Whoa! Uh. s-sorry. man.

7
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.500
Uh. I don't have any money.
I just...

8
00:01:41.502 --> 00:01:43.669
Yeah. right.

9
00:01:43.671 --> 00:01:46.038
Whoa. Sorry. bro.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.875
Watch it. man.

11
00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:09.562
Hey. stop global warming?

12
00:02:09.564 --> 00:02:10.996
So sorry. No speak English.

13
00:02:10.998 --> 00:02:12.965
- Okay.
- So sorry.

14
00:02:12.967 --> 00:02:14.700
Excuse me.
Would you like to sign this

15
00:02:14.702 --> 00:02:16.836
to stop global warming?

16
00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:27.513

She's back?

21
00:02:45.132 --> 00:02:46.799
- Out.
- I'm not sleeping in my car again.

- Get out.

23
00:02:48.502 --> 00:02:49.670
I just want clean underwear.

24

It's my room. too.

Get over here right now. man.
This is crazy.

Oh. my God.
You're not gonna believe this.

- Dude! Dude.
- What?

- Huh?

36

- This better be good. man.
- It is.

- When?
- Uh. yesterday. 12:01 a.m.

42
00:03:53.134 --> 00:03:54.967
Damn. this is crazy. man.

43
00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:57.970
Yeah. but. Ryan. we have no
idea what set the device off.

44
00:03:57.972 --> 00:03:59.872
Like. lab was locked.

45
00:03:59.874 --> 00:04:01.774
It's almost like it decided
to fire on its own.

46
00:04:01.776 --> 00:04:02.942
That's it! I've had it!

47
00:04:02.944 --> 00:04:04.977
Oh. shit.

48
00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:07.012
Hey.
Wh-Where you guys going?

49
00:04:07.014 --> 00:04:09.014
- It's churro day at the cafeteria.
- Nom. nom.

50
00:04:09.016 --> 00:04:10.582
Dean Bronson. hi.

51
00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:12.851
Love the tie.
Uh. are those cats?

52
00:04:12.853 --> 00:04:15.220
Turkish angora.
Uh. d-don't change the subject.

53
00:04:15.222 --> 00:04:16.855
- What subject?
- That.

54
00:04:16.857 --> 00:04:17.856
We've had four
rolling blackouts.

55
00:04:17.858 --> 00:04:19.525
fried electrical circuits.

56
00:04:19.527 --> 00:04:21.160
broken bulbs all over campus.

57
00:04:21.162 --> 00:04:23.595
And it's all because of
your little science project.

58
00:04:23.597 --> 00:04:26.033
- It's my thesis project.
- It's an abject failure.

59
00:04:27.735 --> 00:04:30.202
This university's
science department

60
00:04:30.204 --> 00:04:32.771
prides itself on pioneering

61
00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:34.707
forward-thinking ideas
that yield results.

62
00:04:34.709 --> 00:04:36.141
Results that lead to patents.

63
00:04:36.143 --> 00:04:37.776
Do you see how it works?

64
00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:38.811
So. it's just about money?

65
00:04:38.813 --> 00:04:40.012
Yes. Mr. Phan.

66
00:04:40.014 --> 00:04:41.680
I hate to shatter
your illusions.

67
00:04:41.682 --> 00:04:44.316
but somebody has to keep
the lights on around here.

68
00:04:44.318 --> 00:04:46.752
something you seem
hell-bent on stopping!

69
00:04:46.754 --> 00:04:48.921
Literally! Consider this joke
of a project suspended.

70
00:04:48.923 --> 00:04:49.989
effective immediately.

71
00:04:49.991 --> 00:04:51.690
- What?
- That's right.

72
00:04:51.692 --> 00:04:53.158
I've already called
Professor Boner.

73
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.126
It's pronounced "Bonner."

74
00:04:54.128 --> 00:04:55.728
And he's in total agreement
with my request.

75
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.730
I'm sending security
to come and collect

76
00:04:57.732 --> 00:05:00.165
this energy-sucking doohickey
by 6:00 today.

77
00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:01.734
You can't just take her.

78
00:05:01.736 --> 00:05:03.602
Watch me.
I suggest you wrap up

79
00:05:03.604 --> 00:05:05.873
whatever business
you have left here. capisce?

80
00:05:26.193 --> 00:05:27.828
Hello?

81
00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:49.884
What the hell?

82
00:06:21.382 --> 00:06:23.115
Hey. shit bags.

83
00:06:23.117 --> 00:06:24.650
While you were off
playing games.

84
00:06:24.652 --> 00:06:26.085
our project got shut down.

85
00:06:26.087 --> 00:06:28.022
I hope you're happy.

86
00:07:31.085 --> 00:07:33.085
What is wrong with you?

87
00:07:33.087 --> 00:07:35.455
- Why are you sneaking up on me?
- I was bringing you a...

88
00:07:35.457 --> 00:07:37.422
Well. now it's covered
in bacteria.

89
00:07:37.424 --> 00:07:39.758
so that's two dollars wasted.

90
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.393
So ungrateful.

91

But it was just a dream. right?

125
00:10:10.177 --> 00:10:12.578
- Tombs is dead.
- So is Lori.

126
00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.880
Then who's the killer
this time?

127
00:10:14.882 --> 00:10:17.416
Uh. hello.
Will someone please explain

128
00:10:17.418 --> 00:10:19.320
what the hell is going on?

129
00:10:24.492 --> 00:10:26.526
Okay. Recap.

130
00:10:26.528 --> 00:10:28.960
<i>So. I was stuck
reliving the same day.</i>

131
00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:32.465
<i>Monday the 18th.
over and over and over again</i>

132
00:10:32.467 --> 00:10:34.232
<i>until someone wearing
a Bayfield Baby mask</i>

133
00:10:34.234 --> 00:10:36.368
<i>murdered me on the night
of my birthday.</i>

134
00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:37.903
I had no idea who it was

135
00:10:37.905 --> 00:10:39.505
because I was
such a crazy bitch

136
00:10:39.507 --> 00:10:41.441
<i>and so many people
hated my guts.</i>

137
00:10:41.443 --> 00:10:43.911
<i>So. at Carter's suggestion.
I made a list of suspects.</i>

138
00:10:46.113 --> 00:10:47.979
<i>Turns out it was
my roommate. Lori.</i>

139
00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:49.449
<i>who kept on helping
a serial killer escape</i>

140
00:10:49.451 --> 00:10:51.216
<i>from the hospital.
hoping it would look like</i>

141
00:10:51.218 --> 00:10:53.118
<i>he murdered me when. in fact.
it was her all along.</i>

142
00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.253
<i>and all because she was jealous
of an affair I was having</i>

143
00:10:55.255 --> 00:10:57.356
<i>with my college professor.
Gregory. who was married.</i>

144
00:10:57.358 --> 00:10:59.057
Yeah. I know. Pretty shitty.

145
00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:00.225
But. anyways.

146
00:11:00.227 --> 00:11:02.695
<i>I finally kicked Lori's
crazy ass out a window</i>

147
00:11:02.697 --> 00:11:05.263
<i>and killed her. which broke
the loop. or so I thought.</i>

148
00:11:05.265 --> 00:11:07.332
But now it only looks like
it passed the loop on to you

149
00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:08.668
and you're gonna be stuck
reliving this day

150
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.938
until we figure out
how to stop it.

151
00:11:14.041 --> 00:11:16.176
Of course.

152
00:11:17.111 --> 00:11:18.345
I'm still dreaming.

153
00:11:20.448 --> 00:11:22.548
Wait. What?

154
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:24.282
It's like <i>Inception.</i>

155
00:11:24.284 --> 00:11:27.986
It's a dream within a dream.

156
00:11:27.988 --> 00:11:29.187
Bro. you're not dreaming.

157
00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:33.392
- Ryan. we...
- Shh.

158
00:11:33.394 --> 00:11:35.329
I'm trying to wake myself up.

159
00:11:38.533 --> 00:11:40.332
There. See? You're not dreaming.

160
00:11:40.334 --> 00:11:41.967
Why'd you hit my penis?

161
00:11:41.969 --> 00:11:43.402
Why are you acting like this?

162
00:11:43.404 --> 00:11:45.036
You smacked my dick.
That's rude.

163
00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:46.940
- I barely touched you.
- Okay.

164
00:11:48.142 --> 00:11:49.276
Show me where you died.

165
00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:04.191
Back there. Storage closet.

166
00:12:09.697 --> 00:12:12.297
Hey. Give me that.

167
00:12:12.299 --> 00:12:13.666
I can handle myself.

168
00:12:13.668 --> 00:12:14.669
You've died enough.
haven't you?

169
00:12:16.036 --> 00:12:17.404
Mm.

170
00:12:32.052 --> 00:12:33.621
- Bash his head in.
- Shh! - Shh!

171
00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.553
- Samar. you asshole!
- Why'd you hit me?

172
00:13:07.555 --> 00:13:09.489
Why do you keep
sneaking up on me?

173
00:13:09.491 --> 00:13:11.122
Ah. I think
my cheekbone's broken.

174
00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:12.425
What is happening in here?

175
00:13:12.427 --> 00:13:14.125
Ryan broke my cheekbone.

176
00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:16.194
- Was it him?
- No.

177
00:13:16.196 --> 00:13:18.396
He was here when I died before.

178
00:13:18.398 --> 00:13:19.599
What?

179
00:13:19.601 --> 00:13:21.399
Where'd you get that mask?

180
00:13:21.401 --> 00:13:23.134
It was just laying
in the hallway.

181
00:13:23.136 --> 00:13:24.639
Somebody must have dropped it.

182
00:13:25.673 --> 00:13:27.673
That's it. I've had it.

183
00:13:27.675 --> 00:13:28.641
Wait. wait.
Where you going?

184
00:13:28.643 --> 00:13:30.543
- Uh. churro day at the cafeteria.
- Nom. nom.

185
00:13:30.545 --> 00:13:32.344
We've had four
rolling blackouts.

186
00:13:32.346 --> 00:13:34.312
fried electrical circuits.
broken bulbs all over campus.

187
00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:37.082
And it's all because of
your little science project.

188
00:13:37.084 --> 00:13:38.018
Wait.

189
00:13:39.286 --> 00:13:41.654
What science project?

190
00:13:41.656 --> 00:13:43.656
The Sisyphus Quantum
Cooling Reactor.

191
00:13:43.658 --> 00:13:45.825
We call it Sissy for short.

192
00:13:45.827 --> 00:13:47.593
You see all these?

193
00:13:47.595 --> 00:13:49.394
They're proton lasers.

194
00:13:49.396 --> 00:13:52.330
And when they fire. they cool
the centrifuge right here

195
00:13:52.332 --> 00:13:54.266
to almost below one nanokelvin.

196
00:13:54.268 --> 00:13:56.167
So. basically. we're trying
to prove that time

197
00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:58.169
can be slowed down
on a molecular level.

198
00:13:58.171 --> 00:14:00.706
It hasn't worked yet. but we
did find some promising data

199
00:14:00.708 --> 00:14:03.108
after the device fired
the other night.

200
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:04.477
When?

201
00:14:04.479 --> 00:14:07.347
12:01 a.m. yesterday.

202
00:14:09.717 --> 00:14:11.717
Monday the 18th.

203
00:14:11.719 --> 00:14:13.688
Mm-hmm.

204
00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:17.490
What?

205
00:14:17.492 --> 00:14:20.160
You created the time loop.
dummy.

206
00:14:21.629 --> 00:14:23.194
That's impossible.

207
00:14:23.196 --> 00:14:24.830
That's not what Sissy
was designed to do.

208
00:14:24.832 --> 00:14:26.532
I don't know what to tell you.

209
00:14:26.534 --> 00:14:28.333
Well. maybe we're just
discovering

210
00:14:28.335 --> 00:14:29.669
what it actually does.

211
00:14:29.671 --> 00:14:31.604
An unintended reaction.

212
00:14:31.606 --> 00:14:33.171
Maybe we thought
we were slowing time.

213
00:14:33.173 --> 00:14:34.674
but what if we looped it
instead?

214
00:14:34.676 --> 00:14:36.209
Now you're stuck in this day.

215
00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:38.511
Congrats.

216
00:14:38.513 --> 00:14:40.780
Oh. and by the way.
you're gonna die

217
00:14:40.782 --> 00:14:44.884
again and again and again.

218
00:14:44.886 --> 00:14:47.252
Carter. tell your girlfriend
to stop trying to scare me.

219
00:14:47.254 --> 00:14:49.254
Oh. she's not my girlfriend.

220
00:14:49.256 --> 00:14:51.424
- Well. wait. are you my girlfriend?
- Kinda.

221
00:14:51.426 --> 00:14:53.358
Hey. guys. are you done talking
about your relationship status?

222
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.860
Because she just said
I'm gonna die.

223
00:14:54.862 --> 00:14:56.495
And you need to figure out
how to close the loop

224
00:14:56.497 --> 00:14:57.697
before the killer
finds you again.

225
00:14:57.699 --> 00:14:59.397
But I don't know
how it happened.

226
00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:01.767
It just fired on its own.

227
00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:04.371
Oh. God.

228
00:15:05.506 --> 00:15:07.540
Danielle. hi.

229
00:15:07.542 --> 00:15:08.941
- Where were you?
- What do you mean?

230
00:15:08.943 --> 00:15:10.576
You ditched our house meeting.

231
00:15:10.578 --> 00:15:12.511
- It was canceled.
- When?

232
00:15:12.513 --> 00:15:16.381
Um. after I kicked my murdering
roommate out of a window.

233
00:15:16.383 --> 00:15:18.383
Exactly.
Who's gonna pledge Kappa

234
00:15:18.385 --> 00:15:19.952
now that we have a death curse?

235
00:15:19.954 --> 00:15:21.889
We're in crisis mode. Tree.

236
00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:26.461
Ew. Who are these people?

237
00:15:27.394 --> 00:15:28.461
Hi.

238
00:15:28.463 --> 00:15:30.596
Uh. I'm-I'm-I'm Samar.

239
00:15:31.899 --> 00:15:35.568
Hey. samosa.
my head's the middle one.

240
00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:37.803
Anyhoo. call me
as soon as you're done

241
00:15:37.805 --> 00:15:40.271
with your creepy little
Comic-Con meeting. Ugh.

242
00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:41.841
Did she just call me "samosa"?

243
00:15:41.843 --> 00:15:43.308
Yep.

244
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:44.877
- You think she likes samosas?
- Nope.

245
00:15:44.879 --> 00:15:46.746
Guys. focus.
I don't want to die.

246
00:15:46.748 --> 00:15:48.748
On the bright side.
you'll come back.

247
00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.248
I died 11 times.

248
00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:51.751
11? Hell no.

249
00:15:51.753 --> 00:15:53.318
- That shit hurts.
- Wait a minute.

250
00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.820
Guys. I have an idea.

251
00:15:54.822 --> 00:15:56.856
We just need to find
the safest possible place

252
00:15:56.858 --> 00:15:58.358
and wait it out there.

253
00:15:59.594 --> 00:16:01.161
Where?

254
00:16:21.983 --> 00:16:23.883
What?

255
00:16:23.885 --> 00:16:26.986
There's... safety in numbers.

256
00:16:26.988 --> 00:16:29.588
More like hiding
in plain sight.

257
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:31.857
Who picks a creepy baby
for a mascot anyway?

258
00:16:31.859 --> 00:16:34.694
I knew I should have
gone to M.I.T.

259
00:16:46.841 --> 00:16:49.709
He traveled!

260
00:16:55.583 --> 00:16:57.016
Airball!

261
00:16:57.018 --> 00:16:59.319
Is that you and your mom?

262
00:17:00.688 --> 00:17:01.956
That's cute.

263
00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.560
I was thinking.

264
00:17:07.562 --> 00:17:09.562
It's ironic.

265
00:17:09.564 --> 00:17:11.897
Here I thought I was stuck
in the same day

266
00:17:11.899 --> 00:17:14.834
for some big cosmic reason.

267
00:17:14.836 --> 00:17:17.270
You know.
facing my mom's death.

268
00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.841
It had nothing to do with her.

269
00:17:21.843 --> 00:17:25.580
Turns out it was just
some big scientific fluke.

270
00:17:28.049 --> 00:17:30.885
That doesn't make it mean
any less. does it?

271
00:17:33.087 --> 00:17:34.856
I guess not.

272
00:17:38.626 --> 00:17:40.593
Oh. you got a little something
right here.

273
00:17:40.595 --> 00:17:41.961
Yep. uh. uh.

274
00:17:41.963 --> 00:17:43.963
Yeah.

275
00:17:43.965 --> 00:17:46.532
Sorry. It's...

276
00:17:46.534 --> 00:17:49.034
You're such a grandpa.

277
00:17:49.036 --> 00:17:52.305
Yeah. well.
you fell for it. so...

278
00:17:58.378 --> 00:18:00.780
Please make your way
to the nearest exit

279
00:18:00.782 --> 00:18:02.114
in an orderly fashion.

280
00:18:02.116 --> 00:18:04.415
This is not a drill.

281
00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:06.719
Please make your way
to the nearest exit

282
00:18:06.721 --> 00:18:08.386
in an orderly fashion.

283
00:18:08.388 --> 00:18:10.689
Again. this is not a drill.

284
00:18:27.374 --> 00:18:29.477
Hey. watch it!

285
00:18:30.912 --> 00:18:33.447
Guys! Wait up!

286
00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:46.492
Don't push me.

287
00:18:46.494 --> 00:18:48.060
Hey. I can't find my phone.

288
00:18:49.597 --> 00:18:51.933
Help! Help! Please!

289
00:18:53.067 --> 00:18:54.669
Help!

290
00:18:58.773 --> 00:19:00.541
Help!

291
00:20:41.876 --> 00:20:44.009
- What was that?
- Down here!

292
00:20:44.011 --> 00:20:45.911
Holy shit.

293
00:20:45.913 --> 00:20:47.546
Are you okay?

294
00:20:47.548 --> 00:20:49.517
Yeah. I think so.

295
00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:54.253
Well. damn. Good job.

296
00:20:54.255 --> 00:20:56.722
- I have a little practice.
- What the hell?

297
00:20:56.724 --> 00:20:57.923
I thought you were the killer.

298
00:20:57.925 --> 00:20:59.024
You should have said something.

299
00:20:59.026 --> 00:21:00.161
I was looking for you.

300
00:21:01.629 --> 00:21:03.529
Well. who is it?

301
00:21:03.531 --> 00:21:05.733
Only one way to find out.

302
00:21:14.942 --> 00:21:17.011
What the fu...?

303
00:21:24.585 --> 00:21:26.785
You sure you...
you don't have a twin brother?

304
00:21:26.787 --> 00:21:29.054
Maybe you were separated
at birth.

305
00:21:29.056 --> 00:21:30.257
Of course I'm sure.

306
00:21:36.697 --> 00:21:38.797
- Oh. shit.
- "Oh. shit" is right.

307
00:21:38.799 --> 00:21:39.832
Who are you?

308
00:21:39.834 --> 00:21:40.966
Who you think I am. dummy?

309
00:21:40.968 --> 00:21:42.234
It's you.

310
00:21:42.236 --> 00:21:43.170
- Duh.
- Duh.

311
00:21:44.572 --> 00:21:46.138
What the hell is going on here?

312
00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:48.040
Look. I was trying
to close the loop.

313
00:21:48.042 --> 00:21:50.576
but somehow I got knocked
into a parallel time loop.

314
00:21:50.578 --> 00:21:52.277
We're all in serious danger.

315
00:21:52.279 --> 00:21:54.613
The longer we exist
in the same dimension.

316
00:21:54.615 --> 00:21:56.115
the worse things will get.

317
00:21:56.117 --> 00:21:57.116
It's a butterfly effect.

318
00:21:57.118 --> 00:21:58.817
You have to kill him.

319
00:21:58.819 --> 00:22:00.719
- Me?
- He's going to create bigger problems

320
00:22:00.721 --> 00:22:01.954
if you do not stop him.

321
00:22:01.956 --> 00:22:03.290
Kill him now!

322
00:22:04.658 --> 00:22:06.125
No. screw that. Kill him.

323
00:22:06.127 --> 00:22:08.694
You're wasting your time.
Do it.

324
00:22:08.696 --> 00:22:10.129
Dude. I'm your friend. not him.

325
00:22:10.131 --> 00:22:12.331
Uh... you know what?
Screw this.

326
00:22:12.333 --> 00:22:14.700
I'll just take care of it myself.

327
00:22:17.705 --> 00:22:20.773
- Stop him.
- Wait. Ryan. maybe you should stop.

328
00:22:20.775 --> 00:22:21.907
Look at him. He's crazy.

329
00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:24.276
I'm the one who designed this.
I know what I'm doing.

330
00:22:24.278 --> 00:22:25.911
You don't understand
what you're doing!

331
00:22:25.913 --> 00:22:27.079
Shut up. fake Ryan!

332
00:22:28.983 --> 00:22:30.751
Ryan. this doesn't feel right.

333
00:22:31.919 --> 00:22:33.652
Ryan. stop.

334
00:22:33.654 --> 00:22:35.654
But a parsec is a measure
of distance. not time.

335
00:22:35.656 --> 00:22:37.256
Okay. so now you're gonna call
Han Solo a liar?

336
00:22:37.258 --> 00:22:39.324
No. I'm saying
if a normal Kessel Run is...

337
00:22:39.326 --> 00:22:40.261
Dre. help me.

338
00:22:42.196 --> 00:22:43.762
Come on!

339
00:22:43.764 --> 00:22:45.964
Whoa.

340
00:22:45.966 --> 00:22:48.602
Dude. did you dose my Yoo-hoo again?

341
00:22:50.271 --> 00:22:53.205
What did I tell you about
turning that thing on?

342
00:22:53.207 --> 00:22:56.875
Turn it off now.
Turn it off now!

343
00:22:56.877 --> 00:22:57.943
Just get him. Get him.
Get the man.

344
00:22:57.945 --> 00:22:58.811
Get him. get him. get him!

345
00:22:58.813 --> 00:23:01.080
- Back off! Back...
- Whoa!

346
00:23:01.082 --> 00:23:03.749
- Ryan. just turn it off. man.
- Ryan. what are you doing?

347
00:23:03.751 --> 00:23:06.718
Guys. take the wrench from him.
He's a college student.

348
00:23:08.089 --> 00:23:09.221
It's just a wrench.

349
00:23:09.223 --> 00:23:11.123
Don't be scared of him.

350
00:23:11.125 --> 00:23:12.724
Okay. all right.
just unplug it.

351
00:23:12.726 --> 00:23:14.293
Unplug the machine.
Unplug it!

352
00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.068
Whoa.

353
00:23:23.304 --> 00:23:25.971
No!

354
00:24:32.039 --> 00:24:33.941
Shut up!

355
00:24:43.017 --> 00:24:45.117
Oh. hey. You're up.

356
00:24:45.119 --> 00:24:47.019
Yeah. I wasn't sure if you
wanted to sleep in or not.

- ♪ Yeah. it's my birthday

358
00:24:48.989 --> 00:24:50.991

359
00:24:54.929 --> 00:24:58.165
No fucking way.

360
00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:06.171
Hey. I-I folded
your clothes for you.

361
00:25:06.173 --> 00:25:08.943
Ryan! Get in here right now!

362
00:25:16.083 --> 00:25:18.016
Wait a minute.
you two know each other?

363
00:25:18.018 --> 00:25:19.952
- Yes.
- No.

364
00:25:19.954 --> 00:25:22.788
Ryan. you dumbass!

365
00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:24.424
You sent me back.

366
00:25:24.426 --> 00:25:26.559
- What?
- It's Monday the 18th.

367
00:25:26.561 --> 00:25:28.561
I don't believe this.

368
00:25:28.563 --> 00:25:31.131
I just got out.
How could you do this to me?

369
00:25:32.467 --> 00:25:34.366
Uh... who's this
crazy white girl?

370
00:25:34.368 --> 00:25:37.970
Maybe it was
a-a bad dream or something.

371
00:25:37.972 --> 00:25:40.305
You're right.
It is a bad dream.

372
00:25:40.307 --> 00:25:41.974
It's a nightmare!

373
00:25:41.976 --> 00:25:43.842
This sucks!

374
00:25:43.844 --> 00:25:46.044
It sucks the biggest mega balls

375
00:25:46.046 --> 00:25:49.014
in the history
of shitty ball-suckery!

376
00:25:49.016 --> 00:25:52.753
It...

377
00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:04.466
I'm okay.

378
00:26:05.567 --> 00:26:06.898
You sure?

379
00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.301
Yes.

380
00:26:09.303 --> 00:26:11.870
He just needs to fix this.

381
00:26:11.872 --> 00:26:13.839
Now.

382
00:26:13.841 --> 00:26:15.240
This is a joke. right?

383
00:26:15.242 --> 00:26:17.242
I wish.

384
00:26:17.244 --> 00:26:19.077
Look.

385
00:26:19.079 --> 00:26:22.114
Ryan. we need to go
to your lab. turn on Sissy.

386
00:26:22.116 --> 00:26:24.249
and figure out
how to send me back.

387
00:26:24.251 --> 00:26:26.820
Uh. how do you know
about Sissy?

388
00:26:28.355 --> 00:26:30.389
Oh. my God. Just...

389
00:26:30.391 --> 00:26:32.259
Let's go.

390
00:26:38.198 --> 00:26:40.234
<i>Ándale.</i> people!

Hey. Stop global warming?

392
00:26:49.343 --> 00:26:51.877
A simple "no. thanks" would do!

393
00:26:51.879 --> 00:26:53.147
Sorry!

394
00:26:55.382 --> 00:26:58.484
This is the same day. same day.

401
00:27:17.539 --> 00:27:19.607
You are gay.

402
00:27:22.343 --> 00:27:23.543
Wait. where are you going?

403
00:27:23.545 --> 00:27:25.110
The lab's back that way.

404
00:27:25.112 --> 00:27:27.081
I have some business
to take care of first.

405
00:27:44.031 --> 00:27:46.599
<i>You sneaky little beyatch.</i>

406
00:27:46.601 --> 00:27:48.902
That's weird.

407
00:27:50.137 --> 00:27:51.303
What?

408
00:27:51.305 --> 00:27:53.006
She was supposed to be here.

409
00:27:54.509 --> 00:27:55.876
Who?

410
00:27:58.145 --> 00:28:00.948
Uh. never mind.

411
00:28:02.383 --> 00:28:04.182
She finally rolls in.

412
00:28:04.184 --> 00:28:05.417
Where is it?

413
00:28:05.419 --> 00:28:06.952
Where's what?

414
00:28:06.954 --> 00:28:08.456
- Oh. hey. Carter.
- Hey.

415
00:28:11.325 --> 00:28:12.625
Where's the cupcake?

416
00:28:12.627 --> 00:28:13.726
What cupcake?

417
00:28:13.728 --> 00:28:15.293
The one you made
for my birthday.

418
00:28:15.295 --> 00:28:16.462
The one you poisoned.

419
00:28:16.464 --> 00:28:19.064
Oh. that cupcake.

420
00:28:19.066 --> 00:28:21.199
I'm serious.

421
00:28:21.201 --> 00:28:22.702
Look. I don't know
what stupid joke

422
00:28:22.704 --> 00:28:25.438
Danielle put you up to.
but there's no cupcake.

423
00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.205
Sorry.

424
00:28:27.207 --> 00:28:29.408
All right. I got to go.
I'm pulling a double for Jen.

425
00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:31.276
She's got the flu.

426
00:28:31.278 --> 00:28:33.113
Happy birthday. though.

427
00:28:34.449 --> 00:28:35.450
Toodles.

428
00:28:38.018 --> 00:28:39.619
Something's wrong.

429
00:28:39.621 --> 00:28:41.219
What?

430
00:28:41.221 --> 00:28:42.289
I don't know.

431
00:28:44.224 --> 00:28:46.057
It's different.

432
00:28:48.195 --> 00:28:50.630
- There were two of me?
- Yes.

433
00:28:50.632 --> 00:28:52.665
That is how
this whole thing happened.

434
00:28:52.667 --> 00:28:55.333
You know. this kind of reminds
me of <i>Back to the Future II.</i>

435
00:28:55.335 --> 00:28:57.171
- Totally. Mm-hmm.
- Right?

436
00:28:58.773 --> 00:29:02.176
- You know. with Marty McFly?
- Doc?

437
00:29:03.511 --> 00:29:06.144
- The DeLorean?
- Sorry.

438
00:29:06.146 --> 00:29:08.581
Are you serious? You've never
seen <i>Back to the Future?</i>

439
00:29:08.583 --> 00:29:10.148
No. I...

440
00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:12.186
- How do you...
- Wait.

441
00:29:13.387 --> 00:29:15.053
Oh. my God.

442
00:29:15.055 --> 00:29:16.356
Does this mean that...

443
00:29:18.091 --> 00:29:20.158
Does this mean
that there are two of me?

444
00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.093
I highly doubt it.

445
00:29:22.095 --> 00:29:25.063
It's almost impossible to
create a holographic universe.

446
00:29:25.065 --> 00:29:27.301
You're probably stuck
in a quantum cyclic dimension.

447
00:29:28.536 --> 00:29:30.670
There's only one of you here.

448
00:29:30.672 --> 00:29:33.271
because the other you
got knocked into

449
00:29:33.273 --> 00:29:35.340
a parallel dimension
somewhere in the multiverse.

450
00:29:35.342 --> 00:29:38.076
Okay. Ryan.
Thanks for clearing that up.

451
00:29:38.078 --> 00:29:39.679
That was super helpful.

452
00:29:39.681 --> 00:29:41.614
You never heard
the multiverse theory?

453
00:29:41.616 --> 00:29:44.349
Do I look like someone
who knows what a multiverse is?

454
00:29:44.351 --> 00:29:47.052
Okay. look.
This is our universe.

455
00:29:47.054 --> 00:29:48.386
Okay? Now. look.

456
00:29:48.388 --> 00:29:51.457
In theory. the universe
has six dimensions.

457
00:29:51.459 --> 00:29:54.092
Now. if what you're saying
is true.

458
00:29:54.094 --> 00:29:57.830
then maybe you woke up
on the same day...

459
00:29:57.832 --> 00:29:59.732
but not in the same dimension.

460
00:29:59.734 --> 00:30:01.567
That would explain
the anomalies.

461
00:30:01.569 --> 00:30:04.269
So. how different
are we talking here?

462
00:30:04.271 --> 00:30:05.571
Well. it depends.

463
00:30:05.573 --> 00:30:08.674
Oh. shit.
I forgot our house meeting.

464
00:30:08.676 --> 00:30:10.643
Danielle. I'm sorry. I just...

465
00:30:10.645 --> 00:30:11.811
Hey. babe.

466
00:30:11.813 --> 00:30:12.845
You doing all right?

467
00:30:21.623 --> 00:30:23.589
Hi. Ry.

468
00:30:23.591 --> 00:30:25.493
Hey. Danielle.

469
00:30:40.642 --> 00:30:42.240
Did that look real?

470
00:30:42.242 --> 00:30:44.342
I'm auditioning
for this year's production

471
00:30:44.344 --> 00:30:45.678
of <i>The Miracle Worker.</i>

472
00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:50.850
Did you know Anne Frank
was blind and deaf?

473
00:30:50.852 --> 00:30:53.452
Uh... Helen Keller.

474
00:30:53.454 --> 00:30:55.387
Excuse me?

475
00:30:55.389 --> 00:30:57.690
Anne Frank was in the attic.

476
00:30:57.692 --> 00:30:59.892
Oh.

477
00:30:59.894 --> 00:31:01.527
Whatever.

478
00:31:01.529 --> 00:31:03.529
All I know is acting blind

479
00:31:03.531 --> 00:31:05.531
is probably harder
than actually being blind.

480
00:31:05.533 --> 00:31:07.265
I mean. the skill set it takes.

481
00:31:07.267 --> 00:31:08.734
Meryl Streep
taped her eyelids shut

482
00:31:08.736 --> 00:31:10.368
just to prepare for a role.

483
00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:11.371
Uh-huh.

484
00:31:13.273 --> 00:31:16.842
Well. Somebody missed
our house meeting today.

485
00:31:16.844 --> 00:31:18.844
Oh. um...

486
00:31:18.846 --> 00:31:20.278
I'm sorry. I...

487
00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.847
Totes kidding.

488
00:31:21.849 --> 00:31:24.249
Birthday girls get a free pass.

489
00:31:24.251 --> 00:31:26.586
Anyhoo. we picked
this year's charity.

490
00:31:26.588 --> 00:31:28.521
Are you ready for it?

491
00:31:28.523 --> 00:31:31.424
We're doing the
special needs art fair again.

492
00:31:31.426 --> 00:31:33.158
Oh. Nice.

493
00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.594
You do so much good. Danielle.

494
00:31:34.596 --> 00:31:36.227
I-I really admire that.

495
00:31:36.229 --> 00:31:38.396
Oh. please.
It just warms my heart

496
00:31:38.398 --> 00:31:40.198
seeing all those little faces.

497
00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.701
I mean. don't get me wrong.

498
00:31:41.703 --> 00:31:43.569
Sometimes they try
to hug you too long.

499
00:31:43.571 --> 00:31:46.171
and it gets
a little uncomfortable.

500
00:31:46.173 --> 00:31:48.674
but you just get used to it.

501
00:31:48.676 --> 00:31:50.710
And at the end of the day.

502
00:31:50.712 --> 00:31:53.278
there is no greater gift
in life

503
00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.282
than the love of a child.

504
00:31:57.518 --> 00:31:58.653
Thank you.

505
00:32:01.823 --> 00:32:02.790
Tree?

506
00:32:03.858 --> 00:32:04.792
You okay?

507
00:32:05.927 --> 00:32:08.427
Uh... yeah. I...

508
00:32:08.429 --> 00:32:10.463

509
00:32:10.465 --> 00:32:12.732

510
00:32:12.734 --> 00:32:15.534
Hey. Dad. Um...

511
00:32:15.536 --> 00:32:16.836
Uh... Yeah. yeah.

512
00:32:16.838 --> 00:32:18.403
Sorry. I'm on my way.

513
00:32:18.405 --> 00:32:20.374
I'll be there in a little bit.

514
00:32:21.776 --> 00:32:23.542
I have to go. Um...

515
00:32:23.544 --> 00:32:25.243
Wait. what?
You're leaving?

516
00:32:25.245 --> 00:32:27.713
Uh. yeah. I have to meet up
with my dad for lunch.

517
00:32:27.715 --> 00:32:29.617
It's a birthday thing.

518
00:32:30.885 --> 00:32:32.652
Meet me in the lab at 3:00.

519
00:32:32.654 --> 00:32:35.623
We are figuring this out
before it gets any worse!

520
00:32:41.562 --> 00:32:43.261
- Hey. Dad.
- Hey.

521
00:32:43.263 --> 00:32:45.598
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's okay. sweetie.

522
00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.233
It's just been a weird day.

523
00:32:48.235 --> 00:32:50.703
- Everything okay?
- Uh. yeah.

524
00:32:50.705 --> 00:32:52.872
It's just... stuff. you know.

525
00:32:52.874 --> 00:32:54.272
How's school?

526
00:32:54.274 --> 00:32:55.675
Um. it's fine. Dad.

527
00:32:55.677 --> 00:32:57.443
- Are you ready to order?
- Not yet.

528
00:32:57.445 --> 00:32:58.577
We're still waiting
on one more.

529
00:32:58.579 --> 00:33:00.278
One more? I...

530
00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:02.817
Okay. I'll be right back.

531
00:33:16.798 --> 00:33:18.265
Mom.

532
00:33:20.902 --> 00:33:22.235
Mom!

533
00:33:24.572 --> 00:33:26.439
Whoa!

534
00:33:26.441 --> 00:33:27.973
Hi.

535
00:33:34.615 --> 00:33:36.449
You're here.

536
00:33:36.451 --> 00:33:38.551
Oh. you're really here.

537
00:33:38.553 --> 00:33:40.955
Well. of course I'm here.
It's our day.

538
00:33:44.459 --> 00:33:45.658
Are you okay?

539
00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:48.594
Yeah. Yeah.

540
00:33:48.596 --> 00:33:51.632
Oh. God. I'm fine. I'm just...

541
00:33:54.635 --> 00:33:57.402
It's good to see you.

542
00:34:07.815 --> 00:34:09.915
Okay.

543
00:34:09.917 --> 00:34:11.284
Try it now.

544
00:34:14.622 --> 00:34:16.657
20 seconds.

545
00:34:27.334 --> 00:34:28.934
Yo. is this normal?

546
00:34:28.936 --> 00:34:30.401
Don't worry.
it's not gonna blow up again.

547
00:34:30.403 --> 00:34:33.404
- Again?
- Ten. Nine.

548
00:34:33.406 --> 00:34:35.775
Eight. Seven.

549
00:34:35.777 --> 00:34:37.543
Six. Five.

550
00:34:37.545 --> 00:34:39.779
Four. Three.

551
00:34:39.781 --> 00:34:40.946
Two.

552
00:34:40.948 --> 00:34:42.014
Stop!

553
00:34:43.416 --> 00:34:44.884
Leave it.

554
00:34:44.886 --> 00:34:46.752
- You told me to...
- No. I-I know.

555
00:34:46.754 --> 00:34:48.020
I changed my mind.

556
00:34:48.022 --> 00:34:51.090
This must be
the crazy white girl.

557
00:34:51.092 --> 00:34:53.893
Hey. Tree. Wait up.

558
00:34:53.895 --> 00:34:55.861
Hey. Hey.

559
00:34:55.863 --> 00:34:57.463
Why the change of heart?

560
00:34:57.465 --> 00:34:59.098
- Everything's different.
- Different how?

561
00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:01.433
Wait. when were you
gonna tell me?

562
00:35:01.435 --> 00:35:02.635
Tell you what?

563
00:35:02.637 --> 00:35:04.103
About Danielle.

564
00:35:04.105 --> 00:35:05.504
Yeah. what about Danielle?

565
00:35:05.506 --> 00:35:07.372
Apparently you guys are dating.

566
00:35:07.374 --> 00:35:08.974
Wait. I thought...
I thought you knew that.

567
00:35:08.976 --> 00:35:10.943
I mean. you guys live
in the same house.

568
00:35:10.945 --> 00:35:13.646
Uh. no.
I definitely didn't know.

569
00:35:13.648 --> 00:35:15.815
But the bigger question is:
does she know?

570
00:35:15.817 --> 00:35:17.616
Does she know what?

571
00:35:17.618 --> 00:35:20.052
One of her closest friends woke
up in your bed this morning.

572
00:35:20.054 --> 00:35:21.754
You don't think
that that's newsworthy?

573
00:35:21.756 --> 00:35:23.421
Nothing happened.

574
00:35:23.423 --> 00:35:25.024
I slept in Ryan's bed
last night.

575
00:35:25.026 --> 00:35:26.892
So. why take me home?

576
00:35:26.894 --> 00:35:28.093
Because you were...
you were wasted.

577
00:35:28.095 --> 00:35:29.728
I was afraid
you were gonna fall

578
00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:31.630
or choke on your own vomit
like Janis Joplin.

579
00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.767
Okay.

580
00:35:34.769 --> 00:35:37.603
It's fine. It's fine.
It's fine.

581
00:35:37.605 --> 00:35:39.605
It's fine. This is how
it's supposed to be.

582
00:35:39.607 --> 00:35:41.841
My mom's okay.
Lori isn't trying to kill me.

583
00:35:41.843 --> 00:35:43.576
I mean. this is. like.
the better version

584
00:35:43.578 --> 00:35:45.110
- of my life. right?
- What are you...?

585
00:35:45.112 --> 00:35:46.979
She's in a sorority. Gregory.
She's...

586
00:35:46.981 --> 00:35:48.647
Wait a minute. In this...

587
00:35:48.649 --> 00:35:49.982
in this other dimension.
were we...?

588
00:35:49.984 --> 00:35:52.184
I... I can't do this right now.

589
00:35:52.186 --> 00:35:54.922
No. Tr... Tree!

590
00:35:58.726 --> 00:36:01.427
<i>Are you ready for this?</i>

591
00:36:01.429 --> 00:36:02.995
- I... No. Okay.
- Hold this.

592
00:36:02.997 --> 00:36:05.664
And...

593
00:36:05.666 --> 00:36:07.933
Oh. my God!

594
00:36:07.935 --> 00:36:09.535
It's so weird.

595
00:36:09.537 --> 00:36:11.537
Oh. my... this is amazing.

596
00:36:11.539 --> 00:36:13.172
But I don't think you have
to get another one.

597
00:36:13.174 --> 00:36:14.942
This is. like. the best...

598
00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:18.010
None of these memories
are mine.

599
00:36:23.718 --> 00:36:26.685
I know. I'm just borrowing it
for tonight.

600
00:36:26.687 --> 00:36:28.187
What time you going
to the party?

601
00:36:28.189 --> 00:36:31.523
Um... I. uh... I can't make it.

602
00:36:31.525 --> 00:36:33.027
- Something came up.
- What?

603
00:36:34.462 --> 00:36:36.028
I mean.

604
00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:37.930
we've been planning this
for weeks. Tree.

605
00:36:37.932 --> 00:36:40.199
No. I know. And I know
it's a surprise party.

606
00:36:40.201 --> 00:36:42.001
I'm sorry. It's just...

607
00:36:42.003 --> 00:36:44.737
You know. my parents
are in town. and I need to...

608
00:36:44.739 --> 00:36:46.872
Ugh.
Our tuition dollars at work.

609
00:36:48.542 --> 00:36:50.943
Anyhoo. who told you
about the surprise?

610
00:36:50.945 --> 00:36:53.178
Was it Lori?

611
00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:55.614
I swear. that girl really needs
to learn how to keep a secret.

612
00:36:55.616 --> 00:36:56.815
I don't know
what's going on with you...

613
00:36:56.817 --> 00:36:58.150
You know what. Tree. I'm just
gonna come out and say it.

614
00:36:58.152 --> 00:37:00.686
I have been feeling
so extremely

615
00:37:00.688 --> 00:37:02.121
- unappreciated by you...
- ...following a deadly shootout

616
00:37:02.123 --> 00:37:04.023
- this morning that left one officer dead.
- Hello?

617
00:37:04.025 --> 00:37:05.824
- I'm still talking to you.
- Tombs was the subject

618
00:37:05.826 --> 00:37:06.659
of a nationwide manhunt

619
00:37:06.661 --> 00:37:08.961
that ended after
a five-month pursuit

620
00:37:08.963 --> 00:37:12.131
across four state lines
that left six female victims.

621
00:37:12.133 --> 00:37:13.899
Oh. my God.

622
00:37:13.901 --> 00:37:15.836
He's still here.

623
00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:21.707
He's going to escape!
Call the police!

624
00:37:21.709 --> 00:37:23.709
- Who?
- John Tombs. Just call the police.

625
00:37:23.711 --> 00:37:25.611
- What?
- Wait! Don't go in there!

626
00:37:25.613 --> 00:37:26.979
Shit.

627
00:37:26.981 --> 00:37:28.049
Excuse me.
What are you doing?

628
00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:11.724
Whoa. Drop the ax.

629
00:38:11.726 --> 00:38:13.194
- Wait. I can expl...
- Drop it now.

630
00:38:14.895 --> 00:38:16.729
He's escaped.
He's gonna kill someone.

631
00:38:16.731 --> 00:38:18.831
- Face up against the wall.
- No. you don't understand. Lori...

632
00:38:18.833 --> 00:38:19.800
I'm not asking again.

633
00:38:26.741 --> 00:38:28.807
Please listen to me.

634
00:38:28.809 --> 00:38:30.609
My roommate works here.

635
00:38:30.611 --> 00:38:32.978
She set Tombs free because
she's trying to blame him.

636
00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:34.613
but she's gonna kill me.

637
00:38:34.615 --> 00:38:36.915
I don't know what kind
of shit you're on. lady.

638
00:38:36.917 --> 00:38:38.751
but Tombs is down
in the O.R. right now.

639
00:38:38.753 --> 00:38:40.085
Nurse just took him.

640
00:38:40.087 --> 00:38:41.820
Was she tall.
dark hair and a ponytail?

641
00:38:41.822 --> 00:38:43.822
- Ow!
- Let's go.

642
00:38:43.824 --> 00:38:46.091
I know you think I'm crazy.
but you got to believe me.

643
00:38:46.093 --> 00:38:48.060
Dispatch.
this is Officer Conrow.

644
00:38:48.062 --> 00:38:49.862
Have an 11-55
at the hospital.

645
00:38:49.864 --> 00:38:51.263
Need immediate assistance.

646
00:39:04.779 --> 00:39:06.580
Come on.

647
00:39:10.384 --> 00:39:13.218
I know it's you. Lori!

648
00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:14.787
What? Oh. my God!

649
00:39:17.725 --> 00:39:19.224
Oh. my God.
I thought you were the...

650
00:39:19.226 --> 00:39:21.093
Are you okay?
What the hell is going on?

651
00:39:21.095 --> 00:39:23.095
- Who was that?
- Tombs escaped. He's trying to kill me.

652
00:39:23.097 --> 00:39:24.296
No. Tree. that's not possible.

653
00:39:24.298 --> 00:39:25.998
I just took him down
to the O.R.

654
00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:31.003
What's happening?

655
00:39:31.005 --> 00:39:32.239
I-I don't know.

656
00:39:33.908 --> 00:39:35.174
Oh. my God. he cut the power.

657
00:39:35.176 --> 00:39:36.911
Just stay calm.

658
00:39:38.012 --> 00:39:40.247
Just stay calm. Shit!

659
00:39:43.784 --> 00:39:45.019
Okay. Come on.

660
00:39:54.728 --> 00:39:55.763
Come on.

661
00:40:01.368 --> 00:40:03.368
Where the hell are we?

662
00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:06.939
This must be one of the floors
under construction.

663
00:40:06.941 --> 00:40:10.211
Come on. There's an emergency
exit on the other end.

664
00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:18.050
Wait.

665
00:40:18.052 --> 00:40:20.187
Grab that.

666
00:40:29.897 --> 00:40:31.298
Okay.

667
00:40:32.399 --> 00:40:34.068
Come on.

668
00:41:06.267 --> 00:41:08.202
What?

669
00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:11.872
Did you hear something?

670
00:41:28.422 --> 00:41:31.491
All right. asshole.
let's see what you got.

671
00:41:46.941 --> 00:41:48.840
Ha!

672
00:41:48.842 --> 00:41:50.144
Shit!

673
00:42:08.329 --> 00:42:09.997
Shut up!

674
00:42:11.966 --> 00:42:14.399
Rookie move. Tree.

675
00:42:14.401 --> 00:42:16.469
Oh. hey. You're up.

676
00:42:16.471 --> 00:42:19.271
- What dimension am I in?
- Huh?

677
00:42:19.273 --> 00:42:21.073
Danielle.

678
00:42:21.075 --> 00:42:22.274
Uh. my girlfriend?

679
00:42:22.276 --> 00:42:24.009
Same one.

680
00:42:24.011 --> 00:42:26.178
- ♪ Yeah. it's my birthday
- Okay.

681
00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:27.813
♪ And I ain't gotta
pick up the pho... ♪

682
00:42:29.016 --> 00:42:30.282
Are you okay?

683
00:42:30.284 --> 00:42:31.984
Yeah.

684
00:42:31.986 --> 00:42:33.087
Never better.

685
00:42:34.522 --> 00:42:36.955
Hey. I folded your clothes
for you. so...

686
00:42:36.957 --> 00:42:40.125
Look. no offense. but how could
you possibly end up with her?

687
00:42:40.127 --> 00:42:41.494
With who?

688
00:42:41.496 --> 00:42:43.061
Danielle.

689
00:42:43.063 --> 00:42:44.930
Uh. uh. she's nice.

690
00:42:44.932 --> 00:42:46.965
Oh. "nice."

691
00:42:46.967 --> 00:42:48.166
Wait a minute.

692
00:42:48.168 --> 00:42:49.835
Isn't she. like.
your best friend?

693
00:42:49.837 --> 00:42:51.805
Dude. did you hit
that fine vagine or wha...?

694
00:42:54.542 --> 00:42:58.076
- Huh. Interesting.
- No. I wasn't trying to do any...

695
00:42:58.078 --> 00:43:00.178
- Not as innocent as you look.
- But...

696
00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:02.448
- What? No. I-I...
- You.

697
00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:04.550
Meet me in your lab in an hour.

698
00:43:04.552 --> 00:43:06.351
Huh?

699
00:43:06.353 --> 00:43:08.856
I've got to get out
of these disgusting clothes.

700
00:43:09.957 --> 00:43:12.291
Listen to me carefully.

701
00:43:12.293 --> 00:43:16.028
I need to stay here
in this dimension.

702
00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:17.630
Okay? So just close the loop.

703
00:43:17.632 --> 00:43:19.499
Look. we have no idea

704
00:43:19.501 --> 00:43:21.467
how this even happened
in the first place.

705
00:43:21.469 --> 00:43:25.070
Well. you're all brainy
science people. right?

706
00:43:25.072 --> 00:43:26.271
So you'll figure it out.

707
00:43:26.273 --> 00:43:28.040
You realize we're messing

708
00:43:28.042 --> 00:43:30.142
with things we have
no business touching. right?

709
00:43:30.144 --> 00:43:31.877
Well. maybe you should have
thought of that

710
00:43:31.879 --> 00:43:33.247
before you built
the big dumb thing.

711
00:43:37.585 --> 00:43:41.219
Just...
just please do me a favor

712
00:43:41.221 --> 00:43:44.424
and try to figure this out.
okay?

713
00:43:44.426 --> 00:43:46.492
Please.

714
00:43:46.494 --> 00:43:49.562
Look. this is gonna be
a trial-and-error situation.

715
00:43:49.564 --> 00:43:51.396
We have to rule out
every variable

716
00:43:51.398 --> 00:43:53.433
in order to narrow down
the correct algorithm

717
00:43:53.435 --> 00:43:54.667
that will close the loop.

718
00:43:54.669 --> 00:43:57.269
- Okay.
- Uh. it's days.

719
00:43:57.271 --> 00:43:58.471
maybe weeks of work.

720
00:43:58.473 --> 00:44:00.205
And if what you're saying
is true.

721
00:44:00.207 --> 00:44:02.341
there's no way to keep
a record of our progress.

722
00:44:02.343 --> 00:44:04.044
I'm not following.

723
00:44:05.145 --> 00:44:07.014
Okay. Um...

724
00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:13.653
Say we test. like.
dozens of variables.

725
00:44:13.655 --> 00:44:16.188
By the end of the day.
the loop will reset. right?

726
00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:19.927
So everything we learned
gets...

727
00:44:21.995 --> 00:44:23.429
...erased.

728
00:44:23.431 --> 00:44:26.131
There's no way for us
to track our progress

729
00:44:26.133 --> 00:44:28.634
simply because we just don't
remember anything we learned.

730
00:44:28.636 --> 00:44:30.470
And we'll be back
to square one.

731
00:44:30.472 --> 00:44:32.607
Great.

732
00:44:35.242 --> 00:44:37.177
I'm screwed.

733
00:44:41.115 --> 00:44:43.616
Wait. no. I got it.

734
00:44:43.618 --> 00:44:46.318
Okay. you said everything
resets but your memory. right?

735
00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:48.387
- Yeah.
- All right. well. then...

736
00:44:48.389 --> 00:44:50.255
you're just gonna have
to be a living record.

737
00:44:52.427 --> 00:44:55.728
Wait. you mean memorize
everything?

738
00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:58.564
- Yeah.
- That's genius.

739
00:44:58.566 --> 00:45:00.466
- Yeah.
- No. No. no. no. no.

740
00:45:00.468 --> 00:45:03.736
That's not genius.
I'm not a scientist.

741
00:45:03.738 --> 00:45:05.671
And hello.
I mean. you do realize

742
00:45:05.673 --> 00:45:07.406
there's a killer after me.
right?

743
00:45:07.408 --> 00:45:09.307
That means I'm gonna have
to die over and over again

744
00:45:09.309 --> 00:45:11.613
until you guys figure out
how to close the loop.

745
00:45:13.414 --> 00:45:16.181
I mean. I guess you could just
kill yourself

746
00:45:16.183 --> 00:45:18.283
before they find you.

747
00:45:18.285 --> 00:45:20.620
Wow. Another genius idea.

748
00:45:20.622 --> 00:45:24.356
Um. better than being chased by
some crazy guy in a baby mask.

749
00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:30.364
I mean. do you have
a better idea?

750
00:45:33.535 --> 00:45:36.234

Yep. Never better.

823
00:49:15.923 --> 00:49:18.457

my name or not.

824
00:49:18.459 --> 00:49:20.459

pretty wasted last night.

Ow!

Hey. are you sure you're okay?

829
00:49:27.334 --> 00:49:29.302
No. I'm fine. I...

830
00:49:30.505 --> 00:49:32.605
Mm.

831
00:49:32.607 --> 00:49:35.373
Actually. I'm probably
gonna pass out.

832
00:49:35.375 --> 00:49:37.443
What?

833
00:49:37.445 --> 00:49:39.645
- Yep. Definitely passing out.
- What? No. uh...

834
00:49:39.647 --> 00:49:41.681
You hit that fine vagine
or what?

835
00:49:41.683 --> 00:49:43.616
Is she dead?

836
00:49:43.618 --> 00:49:45.318
- Ryan. little help here. man.
- Oh. okay.

837
00:49:53.561 --> 00:49:55.828
Hey. hey. It's okay.

838
00:49:55.830 --> 00:49:57.897
It's just me.

839
00:49:57.899 --> 00:49:59.799
Hey.

840
00:49:59.801 --> 00:50:02.034
You okay? You really gave me
a scare back there.

841
00:50:02.036 --> 00:50:03.871
Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine.

842
00:50:06.774 --> 00:50:08.741
You still came.

843
00:50:08.743 --> 00:50:09.842
Yeah. of course.

844
00:50:09.844 --> 00:50:11.010
Why wouldn't I?

845
00:50:11.012 --> 00:50:12.778
Oh. we got a hold
of your parents.

846
00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:14.613
They're on their way.

847
00:50:14.615 --> 00:50:17.282
No. They can't come here.
It's not safe.

848
00:50:17.284 --> 00:50:18.686
What are you talking about?

849
00:50:20.755 --> 00:50:21.754
Jesus.

850
00:50:21.756 --> 00:50:23.923
Can I help you?

851
00:50:23.925 --> 00:50:25.860
Oh. it's okay. He's a friend.

852
00:50:27.428 --> 00:50:29.595
Sorry.
Visiting hours are over.

853
00:50:29.597 --> 00:50:31.396
Oh.

854
00:50:31.398 --> 00:50:33.799
All right. Well...

855
00:50:33.801 --> 00:50:34.936
Thanks. Carter.

856
00:50:36.037 --> 00:50:37.839
Yeah. Feel better.

857
00:50:43.077 --> 00:50:45.678
So. I guess now you know why
I wasn't in your class today.

858
00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:46.679
Pardon?

859
00:50:46.681 --> 00:50:48.581
Advanced bio.

860
00:50:48.583 --> 00:50:50.783
Uh. I'm sorry.

861
00:50:50.785 --> 00:50:52.685
Are you in my class?

862
00:50:52.687 --> 00:50:54.421
You don't look familiar.

863
00:50:57.492 --> 00:50:59.658
I'm sorry.

864
00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:01.359
My mistake.

865
00:51:01.361 --> 00:51:02.561
Right.

866
00:51:02.563 --> 00:51:04.364
Well. I'm Dr. Butler.

867
00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:06.999
Nice to meet you.

868
00:51:07.001 --> 00:51:09.502
Ms. Gelbman.
I've been having a hard time

869
00:51:09.504 --> 00:51:11.003
pulling up
your medical records.

870
00:51:11.005 --> 00:51:12.605
I know. I should be dead.

871
00:51:12.607 --> 00:51:15.406
My results.
they don't make sense. right?

872
00:51:15.408 --> 00:51:17.042
Yes.

873
00:51:17.044 --> 00:51:19.044
They're highly alarming.
to be honest.

874
00:51:19.046 --> 00:51:20.513
Wait.

875
00:51:20.515 --> 00:51:21.747
What time is it?

876
00:51:21.749 --> 00:51:23.449
Uh. it's almost 9:30.

877
00:51:23.451 --> 00:51:25.017
- Why?
- She's about to die.

878
00:51:25.019 --> 00:51:26.452
- Who?
- Lori.

879
00:51:26.454 --> 00:51:28.386
- He's gonna kill her.
- What?

880
00:51:28.388 --> 00:51:31.457
Listen to me. You need to stop
her from going down to the O.R.

881
00:51:31.459 --> 00:51:33.759
I'm sorry. I don't know
who you're talking about.

882
00:51:33.761 --> 00:51:35.963
Oh. really?
Well. maybe your wife does.

883
00:51:37.698 --> 00:51:39.834
Go. Go!

884
00:52:10.164 --> 00:52:11.497
Sorry.

885
00:53:44.992 --> 00:53:46.627
Lori.

886
00:54:01.809 --> 00:54:04.512
Who set you free?

887
00:54:14.188 --> 00:54:15.856
Who are you?

888
00:54:19.627 --> 00:54:20.793
Fine.

889
00:54:20.795 --> 00:54:23.531
I go. you go.

890
00:54:30.304 --> 00:54:32.004
Oh. hey. You're up.

891
00:54:32.006 --> 00:54:33.772
I wasn't sure if you wanted
to sleep in or not.

892
00:54:33.774 --> 00:54:34.940
Shut up!

893
00:54:34.942 --> 00:54:38.177
I am so done with this shit.

894
00:54:38.179 --> 00:54:40.779
Then you multiplied
the Euclidean vector

895
00:54:40.781 --> 00:54:43.916
by the square root of pi
to the 17th power.

896
00:54:43.918 --> 00:54:48.554
which then gives us
an axon point of .004.

897
00:54:48.556 --> 00:54:51.056
which then gives us

898
00:54:51.058 --> 00:54:54.159
a linear plane vector of 8.2.

899
00:54:57.598 --> 00:54:58.597
Boom.

900
00:54:58.599 --> 00:54:59.834
Damn.

901
00:55:07.975 --> 00:55:11.944
Well. if these are all
the failed algorithms...

902
00:55:11.946 --> 00:55:15.116
Then there's only one
possibility left.

903
00:55:28.195 --> 00:55:30.062
- Holy shit balls. You did it.
- Oh. oh!

904
00:55:30.064 --> 00:55:31.663
- What? It worked?
- Yes. yes. yes.

905
00:55:31.665 --> 00:55:33.265
It worked?
Oh. my God. it worked!

906
00:55:35.236 --> 00:55:36.869
We did it!

907
00:55:36.871 --> 00:55:38.837
Why are we so excited?
We barely know her.

908
00:55:38.839 --> 00:55:40.272
Honestly. I-I don't know
what just happened.

909
00:55:40.274 --> 00:55:42.007
but that was impressive.

910
00:55:42.009 --> 00:55:43.778
Thanks.

911
00:55:45.079 --> 00:55:46.645
Let's do this.

912
00:55:48.315 --> 00:55:49.948
Just so we're totally clear.

913
00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:51.850
one variant closes the loop
in this dimension.

914
00:55:51.852 --> 00:55:54.086
and the other one sends you
back to your original dimension

915
00:55:54.088 --> 00:55:55.254
and closes that loop.

916
00:55:55.256 --> 00:55:57.656
It's final decision time.

917
00:55:57.658 --> 00:55:59.593
Stay here or go back.

918
00:56:07.735 --> 00:56:09.802
I'm staying here.

919
00:56:09.804 --> 00:56:11.637
Final decision.

920
00:56:11.639 --> 00:56:14.139
Okay. Here we go. then.

921
00:56:14.141 --> 00:56:16.610
Stand back.

922
00:56:30.024 --> 00:56:32.691
Huh? Wait.

923
00:56:32.693 --> 00:56:35.194
- What happened?
- Uh. uh...

924
00:56:35.196 --> 00:56:36.862
Oh. the vector's off.

925
00:56:36.864 --> 00:56:38.297
But you said
this was the right one.

926
00:56:38.299 --> 00:56:40.699
No. the math was right.
Something else is off.

927
00:56:40.701 --> 00:56:42.267
Guys. I have literally
been killing myself

928
00:56:42.269 --> 00:56:43.969
to memorize this shit for you.

929
00:56:43.971 --> 00:56:45.606
Failure's not an option.

930
00:56:47.274 --> 00:56:48.841
What?

931
00:56:48.843 --> 00:56:49.942
There's something
in hard drive.

932
00:56:49.944 --> 00:56:51.677
It must be a virus.

933
00:56:51.679 --> 00:56:55.082
Dude. did you open spam porn
again on the computer?

934
00:56:56.817 --> 00:56:58.684
No.

935
00:56:58.686 --> 00:57:01.253
Great. I have to manually
reenter all this code.

936
00:57:01.255 --> 00:57:02.921
Okay. how long?

937
00:57:02.923 --> 00:57:05.090
Six. seven hours.

938
00:57:05.092 --> 00:57:06.892
Ryan. look at me.

939
00:57:06.894 --> 00:57:09.094
I am on borrowed time here.

940
00:57:09.096 --> 00:57:10.295
Understand?

941
00:57:10.297 --> 00:57:11.763
Get it done.

942
00:57:11.765 --> 00:57:13.634
Uh. yeah. I'm on it.

943
00:57:18.272 --> 00:57:19.707
Tree. wait up.

944
00:57:21.175 --> 00:57:23.108
Hey. Are you sure about this?

945
00:57:23.110 --> 00:57:24.343
Of course I'm sure.

946
00:57:24.345 --> 00:57:26.078
Okay. well.
what about the killer?

947
00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:27.412
I mean. you said people
are gonna die tonight.

948
00:57:27.414 --> 00:57:29.047
If you close the loop
and we don't help.

949
00:57:29.049 --> 00:57:30.115
then they're dead for good.
aren't they?

950
00:57:30.117 --> 00:57:31.316
I have to stay alive.

951
00:57:31.318 --> 00:57:32.784
I can't go back
to that hospital.

952
00:57:32.786 --> 00:57:34.286
It's way too risky.

953
00:57:34.288 --> 00:57:36.121
Okay. so that's it?
You're just gonna walk away

954
00:57:36.123 --> 00:57:37.789
and let a bunch
of innocent people die?

955
00:57:37.791 --> 00:57:38.757
People die every day. Carter.

956
00:57:38.759 --> 00:57:41.760
I can't be responsible
for everyone. okay?

957
00:57:41.762 --> 00:57:43.328
I know how selfish that sounds.
but it's true.

958
00:57:43.330 --> 00:57:45.330
Yeah. no.
that sounds incredibly selfish.

959
00:57:45.332 --> 00:57:46.333
Are you serious?

960
00:57:47.502 --> 00:57:49.334
That's not fair.

961
00:57:49.336 --> 00:57:51.370
You have no idea
how hard this is for me.

962
00:57:51.372 --> 00:57:53.939
I don't want to have to choose
between you and my mom.

963
00:57:53.941 --> 00:57:55.407
but I have to.

964
00:57:55.409 --> 00:57:57.111
What do you mean. "choose"?

965
00:57:59.113 --> 00:58:02.216
Carter. we're together
in the other dimension.

966
00:58:06.454 --> 00:58:08.454
I woke up in your bed
every morning.

967
00:58:08.456 --> 00:58:09.922
just like this morning.

968
00:58:09.924 --> 00:58:13.892
I did it over and over
and over again

969
00:58:13.894 --> 00:58:15.495
until I fell in love with you.

970
00:58:15.497 --> 00:58:18.297
But that version of us
is back there.

971
00:58:18.299 --> 00:58:20.433
and my mom is alive here.

972
00:58:20.435 --> 00:58:22.367
So I've made my decision.

973
00:58:22.369 --> 00:58:25.438
Wh... What if you're wrong?

974
00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:27.239
Huh?

975
00:58:27.241 --> 00:58:28.807
What if you're wrong?

976
00:58:28.809 --> 00:58:30.142
What if this isn't the life

977
00:58:30.144 --> 00:58:31.777
that you're-you're
supposed to have?

978
00:58:31.779 --> 00:58:33.446
So. what?
I'm just supposed to go back

979
00:58:33.448 --> 00:58:35.282
to some dimension
where my mom's dead?

980
00:58:37.184 --> 00:58:38.383
I can't.

981
00:58:38.385 --> 00:58:40.319
I can't lose her again.

982
00:58:40.321 --> 00:58:41.920
You already did.

983
00:58:41.922 --> 00:58:45.057
And none of this is real
if it erases that.

984
00:58:45.059 --> 00:58:47.392
You're just... you're living
someone else's life

985
00:58:47.394 --> 00:58:49.029
that doesn't belong to you.

986
00:58:50.297 --> 00:58:54.366
Y-Your pain.
th-that loss. that's...

987
00:58:54.368 --> 00:58:56.237
that's what makes you you.

988
00:58:59.039 --> 00:59:00.506
But you have the chance
to do something

989
00:59:00.508 --> 00:59:01.940
other people only dream of.

990
00:59:01.942 --> 00:59:04.142
What?

991
00:59:04.144 --> 00:59:06.046
You can say goodbye.

992
00:59:08.516 --> 00:59:10.217
Yoo-hoo.

993
00:59:13.387 --> 00:59:15.555
Your girlfriend's calling you.

994
00:59:15.557 --> 00:59:18.058
Better go.

995
00:59:19.461 --> 00:59:21.260
What's her problem?

996
00:59:21.262 --> 00:59:23.264
She just ditched
our house meeting.

997
00:59:24.965 --> 00:59:27.065
Hello.

998
00:59:27.067 --> 00:59:29.368
What were you guys
talking about?

999
00:59:29.370 --> 00:59:32.137
Nothing. We were just... we
were going over school stuff.

1000
00:59:32.139 --> 00:59:33.905
Babe. don't forget.

1001
00:59:33.907 --> 00:59:35.543
I still need help
with my American lit paper.

1002
00:59:37.479 --> 00:59:39.512
I'm...
I'm really busy right now.

1003
00:59:39.514 --> 00:59:43.115
Carter. you promised.

1004
00:59:43.117 --> 00:59:45.819
I won't pass the class
without your help.

1005
00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:48.186
All right. Yeah. yeah.

1006
00:59:48.188 --> 00:59:49.888
That's fine.

1007
00:59:49.890 --> 00:59:51.426
You're the best.

1008
00:59:58.966 --> 01:00:00.234
There's the other
birthday girl.

1009
01:00:01.935 --> 01:00:03.436
Sweetie. what's wrong?

1010
01:00:03.438 --> 01:00:05.505
I'm okay. I...

1011
01:00:05.507 --> 01:00:07.906
You don't look okay.

1012
01:00:07.908 --> 01:00:09.408
I'm okay. I... Mom!

1013
01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:10.942
You're cold as ice.

1014
01:00:10.944 --> 01:00:12.612
Maybe we should go
to the hospital.

1015
01:00:12.614 --> 01:00:14.447
No!

1016
01:00:14.449 --> 01:00:16.982
No. we can't go there.

1017
01:00:16.984 --> 01:00:19.284
Look. I don't want
to freak you guys out.

1018
01:00:19.286 --> 01:00:21.286
but I need to get as far away
from campus as possible.

1019
01:00:21.288 --> 01:00:22.655
- Theresa. what is going on?
- Dad. please.

1020
01:00:22.657 --> 01:00:25.090
I promise to explain
everything later.

1021
01:00:25.092 --> 01:00:26.992
but I need you to trust me.

1022
01:00:26.994 --> 01:00:28.195
Okay.

1023
01:00:29.464 --> 01:00:30.964
We'll go.

1024
01:00:32.032 --> 01:00:34.366
Let's go. Come on.

1025
01:00:34.368 --> 01:00:36.170
Yeah.

1026
01:00:45.245 --> 01:00:47.913
Done.

1027
01:00:47.915 --> 01:00:49.482
Finally.

1028
01:00:49.484 --> 01:00:53.318
You guys ready?

1029
01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:56.290
Okay. Let's close this loop
once and for all.

1030
01:01:22.082 --> 01:01:24.015
Hey.

1031
01:01:24.017 --> 01:01:27.119
You know what
I'm craving right now?

1032
01:01:27.121 --> 01:01:29.722
- What?
- One of those giant cinnamon rolls

1033
01:01:29.724 --> 01:01:31.626
from that bakery in Morro Bay.

1034
01:01:35.062 --> 01:01:37.262
From our birthday last year?

1035
01:01:37.264 --> 01:01:39.601
You don't remember?
You ate two of them.

1036
01:01:42.537 --> 01:01:44.269
That wasn't me.

1037
01:01:44.271 --> 01:01:46.238
What. sweetie?

1038
01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:48.373
Hey. girls.
it's getting kind of late.

1039
01:01:48.375 --> 01:01:50.075
What do you say we find
someplace.

1040
01:01:50.077 --> 01:01:51.343
turn in for the night?

1041
01:01:51.345 --> 01:01:53.345
Okay. sounds good.

1042
01:01:53.347 --> 01:01:55.282
I think we're all
pretty pooped.

1043
01:02:12.032 --> 01:02:13.400
Lori!

1044
01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:20.475
Shit.

1045
01:02:34.456 --> 01:02:36.254
He got her. he got her!

1046
01:02:36.256 --> 01:02:38.056
No. don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1047
01:02:38.058 --> 01:02:39.993
You might hit Kay.

1048
01:02:41.429 --> 01:02:43.663
Hey. girls.
I'm gonna go get some ice.

1049
01:02:43.665 --> 01:02:44.797
I'll be right back.

1050
01:02:44.799 --> 01:02:47.199
Okay.

1051
01:02:49.203 --> 01:02:51.671
Give me a hand.

1052
01:02:51.673 --> 01:02:53.373
Okay.

1053
01:02:55.677 --> 01:02:58.109
Just tell me one thing.

1054
01:02:58.111 --> 01:02:59.512
Are you pregnant?

1055
01:02:59.514 --> 01:03:00.713
What?

1056
01:03:00.715 --> 01:03:02.380
No. Mom. I...

1057
01:03:02.382 --> 01:03:04.484
Okay. sorry.
I just had to ask.

1058
01:03:04.486 --> 01:03:05.685
It's not like that.

1059
01:03:05.687 --> 01:03:07.385
But it's a boy. isn't it?

1060
01:03:07.387 --> 01:03:09.154
No.

1061
01:03:09.156 --> 01:03:11.158
Yes.

1062
01:03:12.494 --> 01:03:14.127
I don't know.
It's complicated.

1063
01:03:15.229 --> 01:03:16.829
Trust me.

1064
01:03:16.831 --> 01:03:19.565
I can do complicated.

1065
01:03:19.567 --> 01:03:21.703
What is it?

1066
01:03:26.674 --> 01:03:29.274
Have you ever wondered what
your life would have been like

1067
01:03:29.276 --> 01:03:30.676
if you couldn't be with Dad?

1068
01:03:30.678 --> 01:03:32.845
What? No.

1069
01:03:32.847 --> 01:03:34.480
But what if you had to choose?

1070
01:03:34.482 --> 01:03:37.182
You know. what if...
what if being with him meant

1071
01:03:37.184 --> 01:03:39.251
that you would lose someone
that you were really close to.

1072
01:03:39.253 --> 01:03:41.319
that you would never get
to see that person ever again?

1073
01:03:41.321 --> 01:03:42.289
What would you do?

1074
01:03:43.791 --> 01:03:46.492
Well. we all have to make
hard choices. Tree.

1075
01:03:46.494 --> 01:03:49.160
That's life.

1076
01:03:49.162 --> 01:03:51.697
And sometimes the past
is pulling us in one direction

1077
01:03:51.699 --> 01:03:55.333
and the future is calling us
somewhere new.

1078
01:03:55.335 --> 01:03:58.303
But. of course. if I had
to choose. I'd pick Daddy.

1079
01:03:58.305 --> 01:04:00.441
I mean. without him.
I wouldn't have you. right?

1080
01:04:05.279 --> 01:04:07.715
But how did you know
that he was the one?

1081
01:04:08.816 --> 01:04:10.616
I didn't.

1082
01:04:10.618 --> 01:04:12.217
I took a chance.

1083
01:04:12.219 --> 01:04:14.119
I followed my heart.

1084
01:04:14.121 --> 01:04:18.424
That's kind of
how love works. Tree.

1085
01:04:18.426 --> 01:04:19.727
It's a leap of faith.

1086
01:04:27.702 --> 01:04:29.702
...Bayfield University
Hospital.

1087
01:04:29.704 --> 01:04:31.904
where a terrible tragedy
continues to unfold.

1088
01:04:31.906 --> 01:04:33.906
Details are still coming in.

1089
01:04:33.908 --> 01:04:36.642
but so far. we can confirm
three victims.

1090
01:04:36.644 --> 01:04:38.578
A nurse and a police officer.

1091
01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:40.378
The third victim. a student.

1092
01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:42.882
was killed while attempting
to subdue the suspect.

1093
01:04:42.884 --> 01:04:44.282
Back to you. Dan.

1094
01:04:44.284 --> 01:04:46.151
No.

1095
01:04:46.153 --> 01:04:48.754
What's wrong?

1096
01:04:50.625 --> 01:04:53.459
Come on. Ryan. Come on.

1097
01:04:53.461 --> 01:04:55.461
Hey. Samar. can you

1098
01:04:55.463 --> 01:04:57.430
- check 22-97-39 right there?
- Uh. yeah.

1099
01:04:57.432 --> 01:04:59.230
Over there.

1100
01:04:59.232 --> 01:05:01.168
No. the vector
needs to be adjusted.

1101
01:05:02.737 --> 01:05:05.871
Yo. it's Ryan.
Leave a message at the beep...!

1102
01:05:05.873 --> 01:05:07.573
Ryan. don't close the loop.

1103
01:05:07.575 --> 01:05:08.841
- You can't...
- I'm sorry.

1104
01:05:08.843 --> 01:05:10.275
- This voice mailbox is...
- Shit!

1105
01:05:10.277 --> 01:05:11.611
Tree. what is going on?

1106
01:05:11.613 --> 01:05:13.446
I can't let him close it.

1107
01:05:13.448 --> 01:05:15.347
You know.
I'm not sure about this ice.

1108
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:16.616
It kind of smells like pee.

1109
01:05:16.618 --> 01:05:17.650
Tree?

1110
01:05:17.652 --> 01:05:18.884
Tree! Where are you going?

1111
01:05:18.886 --> 01:05:20.853
Tree!

1112
01:05:26.928 --> 01:05:28.761
Come on.

1113
01:05:28.763 --> 01:05:30.730
Come on. come on!
Pick up your phone!

1114
01:05:30.732 --> 01:05:32.765
- Yo. it's Ryan. Leave a...
- Shit!

1115
01:05:32.767 --> 01:05:35.768
Here we go.

1116
01:05:35.770 --> 01:05:38.971
Where is it? Come on.
come on. come on. Please.

1117
01:06:28.623 --> 01:06:31.289
- Oh. hey. You're up.
- Shut up!

1118
01:06:31.291 --> 01:06:32.925
I wasn't sure if you wanted
to sleep in or not.

1119
01:06:32.927 --> 01:06:34.660
That is the last time
I'm dying for you.

1120
01:06:34.662 --> 01:06:36.396
What?

1121
01:06:42.904 --> 01:06:44.804
How much longer
is it gonna take?

1122
01:06:44.806 --> 01:06:47.673
Thanks to your crazy memory.
it shouldn't take long at all.

1123
01:06:47.675 --> 01:06:50.611
I can have Sissy ready to go
in just a few minutes.

1124
01:06:54.615 --> 01:06:56.449
I need a little more time.

1125
01:06:56.451 --> 01:06:58.351
There's something I need to do.

1126
01:07:00.287 --> 01:07:01.689
Tree.

1127
01:07:03.691 --> 01:07:04.826
You sure you want to go back?

1128
01:07:06.961 --> 01:07:10.629
Can't spend my life
living in the past.

1129
01:07:10.631 --> 01:07:12.934
Got to take a leap of faith.

1130
01:07:20.441 --> 01:07:23.576
She finally rolls in.

1131
01:07:23.578 --> 01:07:25.911
Uh. Lori. hi.

1132
01:07:25.913 --> 01:07:27.913
Big night?

1133
01:07:27.915 --> 01:07:29.484
You could say that.

1134
01:07:30.651 --> 01:07:34.889
Um. look. Lori. I...

1135
01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:39.357
It's good to see you.

1136
01:07:39.359 --> 01:07:40.960
Wha...?

1137
01:07:40.962 --> 01:07:42.661
It's good to see you. too.
Tree.

1138
01:07:51.639 --> 01:07:53.338
He's not worth it.

1139
01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:56.008
I mean. trust me.

1140
01:07:56.010 --> 01:07:58.711
I've been involved
with a married guy.

1141
01:07:58.713 --> 01:08:02.081
I know what it's like
living a double life.

1142
01:08:02.083 --> 01:08:03.785
Always feeling like shit
about yourself.

1143
01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:06.921
But it's never too late
to change.

1144
01:08:11.459 --> 01:08:13.859
Someone once told me that

1145
01:08:13.861 --> 01:08:17.897
"every day is a chance
to be someone better."

1146
01:08:17.899 --> 01:08:19.834
Maybe this is your day.

1147
01:08:22.804 --> 01:08:24.637
Okay.

1148
01:08:24.639 --> 01:08:26.306
Thank you.

1149
01:08:35.850 --> 01:08:37.785
Take care of yourself.

1150
01:08:56.838 --> 01:08:58.737
Tree.

1151
01:08:58.739 --> 01:09:00.606
Hey.

1152
01:09:00.608 --> 01:09:05.678
Um... look. Danielle.
I feel really bad.

1153
01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:07.046
I've totally been
misjudging you.

1154
01:09:07.048 --> 01:09:09.148
and it's completely on me.

1155
01:09:09.150 --> 01:09:13.052
- I am so sorry that I've. like. made this...
- Nice.

1156
01:09:13.054 --> 01:09:14.820
Three-way.

1157
01:09:14.822 --> 01:09:17.422
He's kidding.

1158
01:09:17.424 --> 01:09:18.524
No. I'm-I'm not.

1159
01:09:18.526 --> 01:09:21.527
Nick's. um. shower was broken.

1160
01:09:21.529 --> 01:09:23.429
so I said he could use mine.

1161
01:09:23.431 --> 01:09:24.899
Right. Nick?

1162
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.567
My shower's fine.

1163
01:09:28.569 --> 01:09:32.104
Right. Um. you know what?
Never mind.

1164
01:09:32.106 --> 01:09:34.440
Sorry for interrupting.

1165
01:09:34.442 --> 01:09:36.141
Bye-ee.

1166
01:09:36.143 --> 01:09:37.545
Bye-ee.

1167
01:09:39.013 --> 01:09:40.179
Ow!

1168
01:09:40.181 --> 01:09:41.914
What was that for?

1169
01:09:41.916 --> 01:09:43.782
For being dumb as a rock.
That's what.

1170
01:09:43.784 --> 01:09:45.751
Oh. really?
How can a rock be dumb?

1171
01:09:45.753 --> 01:09:48.055
They don't even have brains.

1172
01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:54.760
Ouch.

1173
01:10:04.772 --> 01:10:06.839
There's the other
birthday girl.

1174
01:10:06.841 --> 01:10:08.509
- Hi. sweetie.
- Hey. Dad.

1175
01:10:10.111 --> 01:10:13.579
Um. do you mind if I talk
to Mom alone for a minute?

1176
01:10:13.581 --> 01:10:14.914
Just some girl talk.

1177
01:10:14.916 --> 01:10:16.548
Oh. Well. sure.

1178
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:18.684
I-I can go run some work calls.

1179
01:10:18.686 --> 01:10:20.855
Okay. thanks.

1180
01:10:23.991 --> 01:10:25.157
Is everything okay?

1181
01:10:25.159 --> 01:10:26.725
Yeah. It's fine.

1182
01:10:26.727 --> 01:10:28.029
Everything's fine.

1183
01:10:31.766 --> 01:10:34.700
Oh. shit. how do I do this?

1184
01:10:34.702 --> 01:10:36.704
Do what. sweetie?
What's wrong?

1185
01:10:37.805 --> 01:10:40.574
Mom...

1186
01:10:42.743 --> 01:10:47.212
I really want you to know
how much I love you.

1187
01:10:47.214 --> 01:10:48.747
Aw.

1188
01:10:48.749 --> 01:10:50.182
I love you. too. sweetie.

1189
01:10:50.184 --> 01:10:52.553
No. Mom. I'm serious.

1190
01:10:56.958 --> 01:10:58.857
You know. people say
"I love you"

1191
01:10:58.859 --> 01:11:01.193
all the time. but...

1192
01:11:01.195 --> 01:11:04.196
it's not until you can't say it
to that person's face anymore

1193
01:11:04.198 --> 01:11:06.500
that you really realize
how much you mean it.

1194
01:11:12.073 --> 01:11:16.177
You are so beautiful
and so amazing.

1195
01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:21.146
And I just hope I can become

1196
01:11:21.148 --> 01:11:23.248
half of the woman
that you are one day.

1197
01:11:25.186 --> 01:11:26.921
Are you kidding?

1198
01:11:29.557 --> 01:11:32.026
I'm the woman I am
because I had you.

1199
01:11:33.627 --> 01:11:36.261
You know. I never really
told anyone this before.

1200
01:11:36.263 --> 01:11:39.865
but when I was pregnant with
you. I was scared shitless.

1201
01:11:39.867 --> 01:11:41.900
No.

1202
01:11:41.902 --> 01:11:45.004
But then.
the moment I held you.

1203
01:11:45.006 --> 01:11:50.242
something inside of me
changed instantly.

1204
01:11:50.244 --> 01:11:51.777
The best kind of love
does that.

1205
01:11:51.779 --> 01:11:52.845
It changes you.

1206
01:11:52.847 --> 01:11:53.948
It makes you a better person.

1207
01:11:58.352 --> 01:12:01.055
Oh. God. I'm so stupid.

1208
01:12:02.890 --> 01:12:05.958
I really thought I could
have it all. but I can't.

1209
01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:08.160
Oh. honey. nobody can.

1210
01:12:08.162 --> 01:12:09.728
But guess what.

1211
01:12:09.730 --> 01:12:10.929
That's okay.

1212
01:12:10.931 --> 01:12:12.266
You'll get what you need.

1213
01:12:13.367 --> 01:12:16.037
I hope so.

1214
01:12:17.138 --> 01:12:18.906
Aw. Come here.

1215
01:12:22.376 --> 01:12:24.011
Aw.

1216
01:12:27.882 --> 01:12:29.314
Am I crushing you?

1217
01:12:30.384 --> 01:12:31.850
Nope.

1218
01:12:31.852 --> 01:12:33.318
You're always gonna be
my little girl.

1219
01:12:35.056 --> 01:12:38.891
♪ Happy birthday to you

1220
01:12:38.893 --> 01:12:44.329

Make a wish.

1224
01:13:24.138 --> 01:13:25.306
You ready?

1225
01:13:28.742 --> 01:13:30.742
Wait.

1226
01:13:30.744 --> 01:13:34.246
Um. look.

1227
01:13:34.248 --> 01:13:37.382
I know this is probably
pretty confusing.

1228
01:13:37.384 --> 01:13:42.154
I mean. you guys have only
known me for a couple hours.

1229
01:13:42.156 --> 01:13:45.390
but I've known you for weeks.

1230
01:13:45.392 --> 01:13:47.893
You've all worked
really. really hard

1231
01:13:47.895 --> 01:13:50.696
to try to send me home.

1232
01:13:50.698 --> 01:13:52.931
So thank you.

1233
01:13:52.933 --> 01:13:55.000
Well. jury's still out
on whether you're totally nuts.

1234
01:13:55.002 --> 01:13:56.735
but. uh...

1235
01:13:56.737 --> 01:13:58.038
glad we could help.

1236
01:14:01.375 --> 01:14:03.310
Okay. Ryan. light her up.

1237
01:14:11.886 --> 01:14:14.853
S-So. in this other dimension.
do we...

1238
01:14:14.855 --> 01:14:16.657
do we know each other?

1239
01:14:17.925 --> 01:14:19.459
You could say that.

1240
01:14:19.461 --> 01:14:21.960
17 seconds.

1241
01:14:21.962 --> 01:14:25.164
16. 15. 14...

1242
01:14:25.166 --> 01:14:29.067
What did I tell you
about turning that thing on?

1243
01:14:29.069 --> 01:14:31.270
- Uh-oh.
- Wait. This isn't supposed to happen yet.

1244
01:14:31.272 --> 01:14:33.038
You're not supposed to come
until tomorrow.

1245
01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:34.806
Turn that thing off now.

1246
01:14:34.808 --> 01:14:35.876
No. don't!

1247
01:14:37.011 --> 01:14:38.911
- No. no. no. no!
- No. no!

1248
01:14:41.782 --> 01:14:43.483
No. wait. please.
You can't do this.

1249
01:14:43.485 --> 01:14:46.752
- And who are you?
- I am a student here.

1250
01:14:46.754 --> 01:14:48.020
Oh. well. keep this
little attitude up.

1251
01:14:48.022 --> 01:14:49.087
and we'll change that.

1252
01:14:49.089 --> 01:14:50.189
Get that thing out of here.

1253
01:14:50.191 --> 01:14:52.124
- No. please d-don't.
- Hey. watch it. beefcake.

1254
01:14:52.126 --> 01:14:53.959
- Don't. Don't.
- We spent 18 months on that thing.

1255
01:14:53.961 --> 01:14:55.428
Please. please don't. Please.

1256
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:57.430
Well. don't manhandle her.

1257
01:14:57.432 --> 01:14:58.899
Take...

1258
01:15:00.134 --> 01:15:02.334
Well. where are you taking her?

1259
01:15:02.336 --> 01:15:06.240
My office. where it will
remain under lock and key.

1260
01:15:15.816 --> 01:15:17.382
Look. okay. it's a setback.
I get it.

1261
01:15:17.384 --> 01:15:19.418
Right. but we just
reset the day and try again.

1262
01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:22.488
No. You don't understand.

1263
01:15:22.490 --> 01:15:25.057
I keep getting weaker
every time I come back.

1264
01:15:25.059 --> 01:15:27.527
I don't know
how many chances I have left.

1265
01:15:27.529 --> 01:15:29.261
For all I know.
this could be it.

1266
01:15:29.263 --> 01:15:31.431
If I die again.
I could stay dead.

1267
01:15:31.433 --> 01:15:33.267
- Hmm. that's a problem.
- No shit.

1268
01:15:34.368 --> 01:15:35.936
Unless...

1269
01:15:40.007 --> 01:15:41.974
Unless we steal it back.

1270
01:15:41.976 --> 01:15:43.275
Steal it?

1271
01:15:43.277 --> 01:15:45.110
Well. I mean. you know.

1272
01:15:45.112 --> 01:15:46.479
it's not even
technically stealing. is it?

1273
01:15:46.481 --> 01:15:47.980
It's your property.

1274
01:15:47.982 --> 01:15:49.549
Whoa. whoa. guys.
I don't know about this.

1275
01:15:49.551 --> 01:15:51.484
Like. if we get caught
and I get expelled.

1276
01:15:51.486 --> 01:15:54.119
my parents are gonna hang me
by the nut sack.

1277
01:15:54.121 --> 01:15:55.455
I'm with him.

1278
01:15:55.457 --> 01:15:57.322
Except for the "nut sack" part.
obviously.

1279
01:15:57.324 --> 01:15:59.492
Are you kidding me? Are...

1280
01:15:59.494 --> 01:16:01.494
No. I'm sorry to throw
a bag of dog shit

1281
01:16:01.496 --> 01:16:03.028
on your front porch here.
but I...

1282
01:16:03.030 --> 01:16:04.263
This is all on you guys.

1283
01:16:04.265 --> 01:16:05.998
You created this mess.

1284
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.467
so you're obligated
to help her out of it.

1285
01:16:07.469 --> 01:16:08.867
Besides.
if she dies again tonight.

1286
01:16:08.869 --> 01:16:10.202
that's blood on your hands.

1287
01:16:10.204 --> 01:16:12.371
That's a little dramatic.

1288
01:16:12.373 --> 01:16:13.907
He's right.

1289
01:16:15.577 --> 01:16:17.244
This is our fault.

1290
01:16:20.347 --> 01:16:21.913
So we fix it.

1291
01:16:21.915 --> 01:16:25.052
That's what scientists do.

1292
01:16:26.186 --> 01:16:27.988
We solve the problem.

1293
01:16:30.458 --> 01:16:32.592
So. Dean Bronson's office
is in this building here.

1294
01:16:32.594 --> 01:16:36.094
and the fastest route back
to the lab is this path here.

1295
01:16:36.096 --> 01:16:37.530
And check this out. guys.
Dean Bronson spends

1296
01:16:37.532 --> 01:16:39.264
every evening knitting in
the faculty lounge over here.

1297
01:16:39.266 --> 01:16:41.366
- Wait. what? He knits?
- I think he used to smoke.

1298
01:16:41.368 --> 01:16:44.236
and then his wife
made him quit. and. uh...

1299
01:16:44.238 --> 01:16:47.205
Oh. by the way. shockingly hot.

1300
01:16:47.207 --> 01:16:48.907
- Samar?
- Hmm?

1301
01:16:48.909 --> 01:16:50.909
Could we do the-the thing
we're...

1302
01:16:50.911 --> 01:16:52.244
- we're doing right now?
- Okay. okay.

1303
01:16:52.246 --> 01:16:53.613
Right. Sorry.
Um. okay.

1304
01:16:53.615 --> 01:16:55.648
So. we need to get the keys
to his office.

1305
01:16:55.650 --> 01:16:57.650
sneak over to admissions.
break into the dean's office.

1306
01:16:57.652 --> 01:16:59.652
grab Sissy.
wheel her back to the lab

1307
01:16:59.654 --> 01:17:01.253
without anyone from security
seeing us.

1308
01:17:01.255 --> 01:17:02.387
get Dean Bronson's keys
back to him

1309
01:17:02.389 --> 01:17:03.656
without him ever knowing
they were gone.

1310
01:17:03.658 --> 01:17:04.557
power up Sissy.
run diagnostics.

1311
01:17:04.559 --> 01:17:07.427
flip the switch. and bam...
Tree's back

1312
01:17:07.429 --> 01:17:09.194
in whatever wack-ass dimension
she came from.

1313
01:17:09.196 --> 01:17:12.931
and we... well. we just
saved the damn day.

1314
01:17:12.933 --> 01:17:14.366
Okay.

1315
01:17:14.368 --> 01:17:16.935
Sounds awesome.

1316
01:17:16.937 --> 01:17:19.137
- How do we do that?
- I don't know.

1317
01:17:19.139 --> 01:17:21.273
- Of course.
- Okay. well.

1318
01:17:21.275 --> 01:17:23.041
we obviously need a diversion.

1319
01:17:23.043 --> 01:17:25.377
So we just got to find a way
to distract Dean Bronson.

1320
01:17:25.379 --> 01:17:27.381
♪ You're beautiful

1321
01:17:28.982 --> 01:17:31.551
♪ You're beautiful

1322
01:17:31.553 --> 01:17:33.185
♪ You're beautiful.
it's true... ♪

1323
01:17:33.187 --> 01:17:35.220
Uh. she picked the ringtone.
all right? I...

1324
01:17:35.222 --> 01:17:36.556
Hey. babe.

1325
01:17:36.558 --> 01:17:38.056
Yeah. uh. you okay?

1326
01:17:38.058 --> 01:17:39.659
- I-I have an idea.
- Okay.

1327
01:17:39.661 --> 01:17:41.259
What if we actually
go through...

1328
01:17:41.261 --> 01:17:42.394
With Ryan and them and...

1329
01:17:42.396 --> 01:17:44.196
- Danielle. hi.
- She's not...

1330
01:17:44.198 --> 01:17:48.200
So. we have
a little favor to ask.

1331
01:17:48.202 --> 01:17:49.935
I feel suspect at best.

1332
01:17:49.937 --> 01:17:51.336
Let's just put our face in.

1333
01:17:51.338 --> 01:17:53.038
Hey. baby.

1334
01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:55.207
Oh. Okay. sorry.

1335
01:17:55.209 --> 01:17:57.309
- Clearly. she's a little on edge.
- Mm-hmm.

1336
01:17:57.311 --> 01:17:59.044
- That's right.
- Give her some room to breathe...

1337
01:17:59.046 --> 01:18:00.546
Preach.

1338
01:18:05.085 --> 01:18:06.452
Can I help you?

1339
01:18:06.454 --> 01:18:08.253
<i>Oh. perdón.</i>

1340
01:18:08.255 --> 01:18:10.891
I appear to be. uh. very lost.

1341
01:18:13.695 --> 01:18:17.597
Roger Bronson.
I'm the dean of the school.

1342
01:18:17.599 --> 01:18:19.030
<i>Oh. bonjour.</i>

1343
01:18:19.032 --> 01:18:24.202
My name is. uh. Amelie Le Pew.

1344
01:18:24.204 --> 01:18:26.271
Oh. You must be with
the exchange program.

1345
01:18:26.273 --> 01:18:28.073
<i>Ah. oui. oui.</i>

1346
01:18:28.075 --> 01:18:30.175
<i>Monsieur.</i> may I know your face?

1347
01:18:30.177 --> 01:18:32.110
I'm sorry?

1348
01:18:32.112 --> 01:18:33.245
Oh.

1349
01:18:33.247 --> 01:18:36.014
- My. Oh. my.
- Oh. my!

1350
01:18:37.519 --> 01:18:39.619
What strong features.

1351
01:18:39.621 --> 01:18:40.720
Thank you.

1352
01:18:40.722 --> 01:18:42.053
You must be French.

1353
01:18:42.055 --> 01:18:43.456
Your hand smells like cheese.

1354
01:18:43.458 --> 01:18:45.192
I don't eat cheese.

1355
01:18:47.394 --> 01:18:49.662
Ah. I am. uh...

1356
01:18:51.331 --> 01:18:55.300
...uh. lactose intolerant.

1357
01:18:55.302 --> 01:18:57.035
<i>Oh. quelle dommage.</i>

1358
01:18:57.037 --> 01:19:00.105
Uh. uh... uh. where are you
trying to get to?

1359
01:19:00.107 --> 01:19:01.273
<i>Uh. le café.</i>

1360
01:19:01.275 --> 01:19:02.775
Oh. you must mean
the cafeteria.

1361
01:19:02.777 --> 01:19:05.478
- I'm happy to show you. Here. here. I can...
- Uh. whoa!

1362
01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:07.480
Oh. oh! Oh. don't move!
You'll trip.

1363
01:19:07.482 --> 01:19:09.549
Oh. marbles.

1364
01:19:09.551 --> 01:19:12.485
Marbles! Marbles everywhere.

1365
01:19:12.487 --> 01:19:14.321
Go. go. go. go.

1366
01:19:16.724 --> 01:19:18.524
Oh. boy.

1367
01:19:18.526 --> 01:19:20.493
Oh.

1368
01:19:20.495 --> 01:19:22.360
- Careful.
- Whew!

1369
01:19:22.362 --> 01:19:23.796
Whoa.
Pretty quick there.

1370
01:19:23.798 --> 01:19:25.631
Hold on. now.
Just stay put. okay?

1371
01:19:25.633 --> 01:19:27.367
I just need to. uh.
grab my keys.

1372
01:19:29.437 --> 01:19:30.572
Whoa!

1373
01:19:32.507 --> 01:19:35.240
Oh! Not the tapestry.

1374
01:19:35.242 --> 01:19:36.676
Oh. geez.

1375
01:19:36.678 --> 01:19:38.644
- Oh. Oh. Lord.
- Oh. oh. oh! Oh. no!

1376
01:19:38.646 --> 01:19:40.580
Oh. no. It's so dark.

1377
01:19:40.582 --> 01:19:41.781
Move toward the light.

1378
01:19:41.783 --> 01:19:43.148
Oh. sorry.
that was insensitive.

1379
01:19:43.150 --> 01:19:44.519
Come on.

1380
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:51.591
- Come on. come on. come on.
- I'm trying.

1381
01:19:51.593 --> 01:19:54.059
Stop rolling. Okay.

1382
01:19:54.061 --> 01:19:55.763
You're not helping.
The other way.

1383
01:20:02.369 --> 01:20:04.169
- Sissy.
- Go. go.

1384
01:20:04.171 --> 01:20:05.270
Go around. go around.

1385
01:20:05.272 --> 01:20:06.474
This way.

1386
01:20:11.178 --> 01:20:12.714
Samar. Samar.

1387
01:20:15.082 --> 01:20:17.382
Okay. okay.

1388
01:20:17.384 --> 01:20:18.784
Here we go. Up. Up.

1389
01:20:18.786 --> 01:20:20.520
Oh. God.

1390
01:20:20.522 --> 01:20:22.588
Here's your cane.

1391
01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:25.090
You really must stop
wandering around.

1392
01:20:25.092 --> 01:20:27.392
- Gracias. Okay.
- Okay. Shall we?

1393
01:20:27.394 --> 01:20:29.263
Ah. forgot my keys.

1394
01:20:32.834 --> 01:20:35.535
- Oh. God!
- Oh. no. <i>mon Dieu.</i>

1395
01:20:35.537 --> 01:20:36.602
God!

1396
01:20:36.604 --> 01:20:38.571
Oh. that's a lot of blood.

1397
01:20:38.573 --> 01:20:40.673
Jesus. be careful
with that thing.

1398
01:20:40.675 --> 01:20:43.141
- I am so sorry.
- Oh. my God.

1399
01:20:43.143 --> 01:20:47.345
Oh. I don't think the cane
is a good idea for you.

1400
01:20:47.347 --> 01:20:49.116
You need a Seeing Eye dog.

1401
01:20:54.254 --> 01:20:55.823
Checkmate.

1402
01:20:59.226 --> 01:21:01.159
Hey. How's it going?

1403
01:21:01.161 --> 01:21:03.163
We're on it.

1404
01:21:07.635 --> 01:21:09.468
Guys. we've got less
than three hours

1405
01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:10.736
to make this happen.

1406
01:21:10.738 --> 01:21:12.607
Not gonna lie...
it's gonna be close.

1407
01:21:14.241 --> 01:21:15.841
Shit.

1408
01:21:15.843 --> 01:21:18.513
If I don't stop the killer.
Lori's gonna die.

1409
01:21:19.647 --> 01:21:20.846
Stay here.

1410
01:21:20.848 --> 01:21:22.715
What? Why?

1411
01:21:22.717 --> 01:21:24.452
Just promise me
you'll stay here.

1412
01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:26.819
Can I borrow this?

1413
01:21:26.821 --> 01:21:28.353
Uh. y-yeah. sure.

1414
01:21:28.355 --> 01:21:29.455
Okay.

1415
01:21:29.457 --> 01:21:31.457
W-Wait. where are you going?

1416
01:21:31.459 --> 01:21:32.792
Tree!

1417
01:21:55.750 --> 01:21:58.249
Sorry. bad timing.

1418
01:22:07.428 --> 01:22:10.830
Okay. Okay.

1419
01:22:10.832 --> 01:22:13.432
Okay. you can put it away.

1420
01:22:13.434 --> 01:22:15.570
Come on. put it away.

1421
01:22:18.473 --> 01:22:21.809
Okay. now slowly turn around.

1422
01:22:27.882 --> 01:22:30.516
This is a really bad idea.

1423
01:22:30.518 --> 01:22:32.250
There's a killer
on the loose here.

1424
01:22:32.252 --> 01:22:33.385
Go get help.

1425
01:22:33.387 --> 01:22:34.689
- What?
- Go!

1426
01:22:37.357 --> 01:22:39.692
She's got a gun!
She's got a gun!

1427
01:22:47.969 --> 01:22:49.669
Lori. move.

1428
01:22:51.271 --> 01:22:53.439
- What?
- Come on. we've got to move.

1429
01:22:53.441 --> 01:22:55.407
- What's happening?
- I'll explain later. Move!

1430
01:23:05.653 --> 01:23:07.354
What is this?

1431
01:23:09.791 --> 01:23:11.859
You're not blind.

1432
01:23:14.327 --> 01:23:15.895
I'm gonna kill them.

1433
01:23:15.897 --> 01:23:18.733
I'm going to kill them!

1434
01:23:21.436 --> 01:23:22.835
He's onto us.

1435
01:23:22.837 --> 01:23:25.037
Babe. can you also get
my sunglasses back?

1436
01:23:25.039 --> 01:23:26.406
I just got those.

1437
01:23:30.478 --> 01:23:32.611
Okay. okay. come on. Yes.

1438
01:23:32.613 --> 01:23:34.279
Get it open now.

1439
01:23:34.281 --> 01:23:35.248
Get it. get it.

1440
01:23:37.552 --> 01:23:39.384
Bash it in.

1441
01:23:39.386 --> 01:23:41.352
- Keep 'em out.
- We're trying!

1442
01:23:41.354 --> 01:23:43.388
Get it open now!

1443
01:23:43.390 --> 01:23:46.357
Oh. my God. If I get expelled.
my parents are gonna disown me.

1444
01:23:46.359 --> 01:23:47.660
Tree. will you please tell me
what's going on?

1445
01:23:47.662 --> 01:23:49.695
At first. I thought
he was trying to kill me.

1446
01:23:49.697 --> 01:23:51.364
- but it's you he's after.
- Who?

1447
01:23:52.533 --> 01:23:54.602
It's over. Gregory.

1448
01:24:00.808 --> 01:24:03.374
What? Why?

1449
01:24:03.376 --> 01:24:05.613
His wife found out
about your affair.

1450
01:24:08.649 --> 01:24:12.653
<i>So he stole a page
from your old playbook.</i>

1451
01:24:15.690 --> 01:24:17.656
<i>He set Tombs free.
knowing that everyone</i>

1452
01:24:17.658 --> 01:24:20.325
<i>would think that he killed you.</i>

1453
01:24:20.327 --> 01:24:23.263
<i>And the secret of your affair
would die with you.</i>

1454
01:24:26.434 --> 01:24:27.700
Bravo.

1455
01:24:27.702 --> 01:24:29.935
Well done. indeed.

1456
01:24:29.937 --> 01:24:32.104
Once a douchebag.
always a douchebag.

1457
01:24:32.106 --> 01:24:33.806
I'm sorry. do I know you?

1458
01:24:33.808 --> 01:24:34.942
Stay back. asshole.

1459
01:24:39.647 --> 01:24:41.781
Put your back into it!

1460
01:24:41.783 --> 01:24:43.015
Try harder.

1461
01:24:43.017 --> 01:24:45.751
You guys got to get back
into the gym. man.

1462
01:24:46.888 --> 01:24:48.988
Ryan. we can't hold it
much longer.

1463
01:24:48.990 --> 01:24:50.856
Come on. come on.

1464
01:24:52.426 --> 01:24:53.659
You hear that?

1465
01:24:53.661 --> 01:24:55.295
You're gonna rot in prison.

1466
01:24:56.396 --> 01:24:58.130
I don't think so.

1467
01:24:58.132 --> 01:24:59.965
You see.
there's one little detail

1468
01:24:59.967 --> 01:25:01.867
you failed to realize
in all this.

1469
01:25:01.869 --> 01:25:03.869
Oh. really? What's that?

1470
01:25:03.871 --> 01:25:05.403
Me.

1471
01:25:06.707 --> 01:25:08.609
Lori!

1472
01:25:09.744 --> 01:25:11.409
You really think
I was gonna let

1473
01:25:11.411 --> 01:25:13.078
a little whore like that
ruin my life?

1474
01:25:23.157 --> 01:25:25.991
Gregory. kill her.

1475
01:25:40.908 --> 01:25:43.477
Would you like
to do the honors?

1476
01:25:44.779 --> 01:25:46.547
Don't mind if I do.

1477
01:25:49.984 --> 01:25:52.653
Oh. wait.
I almost forgot.

1478
01:25:54.956 --> 01:25:56.924
I want a divorce.

1479
01:25:58.192 --> 01:26:00.626
Now. where were we?

1480
01:26:00.628 --> 01:26:01.929
Hey!

1481
01:26:46.774 --> 01:26:51.913
Aw. look who brought
a screwdriver to a gunfight.

1482
01:26:55.983 --> 01:26:57.084
Wait.

1483
01:26:58.586 --> 01:27:00.152
I have something
I need to tell you.

1484
01:27:00.154 --> 01:27:01.188
What?

1485
01:27:02.490 --> 01:27:04.492
You're screwed.

1486
01:27:08.963 --> 01:27:10.696
Turn it off. you bitch.

1487
01:27:16.037 --> 01:27:19.605
No. No. no. no. no.
no. no. wait. Wait!

1488
01:27:38.626 --> 01:27:40.259
Ready? Come on.

1489
01:27:40.261 --> 01:27:41.927
There you go. I got you.

1490
01:27:41.929 --> 01:27:44.296
I got you.

1491
01:27:44.298 --> 01:27:46.298
All right. Yep.

1492
01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:48.267
Oh. my God. Are you okay?

1493
01:27:48.269 --> 01:27:50.869
I guess this is a pretty good
place to get shot. huh?

1494
01:27:50.871 --> 01:27:52.237
I'll lift you up now.
all right?

1495
01:27:52.239 --> 01:27:53.772
- You're gonna be okay.
- You're good.

1496
01:27:53.774 --> 01:27:55.741
It's okay. it's okay.

1497
01:27:55.743 --> 01:27:57.643
You're okay.

1498
01:27:57.645 --> 01:27:59.044
Lori. I...

1499
01:27:59.046 --> 01:28:01.547
I'm so sorry.

1500
01:28:01.549 --> 01:28:03.282
For what?

1501
01:28:03.284 --> 01:28:05.250
You just saved my life.

1502
01:28:05.252 --> 01:28:08.087
I just...

1503
01:28:08.089 --> 01:28:09.955
I wish things
could have been different.

1504
01:28:09.957 --> 01:28:12.226
I'm sorry.
but we need to move her.

1505
01:28:15.096 --> 01:28:16.897
Hang in there. hon.

1506
01:28:22.770 --> 01:28:24.103
Hey.

1507
01:28:24.105 --> 01:28:25.671
- Hey.
- You okay?

1508
01:28:25.673 --> 01:28:27.172
Uh. yeah.

1509
01:28:27.174 --> 01:28:29.241
Yeah. I'm fine. I...

1510
01:28:29.243 --> 01:28:31.210
I thought I told you
to stay put.

1511
01:28:31.212 --> 01:28:33.345
Yeah. well...

1512
01:28:33.347 --> 01:28:35.014
sorry. couldn't help myself.

1513
01:28:40.221 --> 01:28:44.189
I think it's time.

1514
01:28:44.191 --> 01:28:47.128
I hope you realize I'm only
going back for one reason.

1515
01:30:12.447 --> 01:30:14.815
Oh. man.

1516
01:30:17.785 --> 01:30:19.353
My Yoo-hoo.

1517
01:30:37.439 --> 01:30:39.972
Danielle?

1518
01:30:39.974 --> 01:30:41.809
Who?

1519
01:30:47.815 --> 01:30:49.748

1520
01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:52.251

Yes. it does.

1571
01:33:10.190 --> 01:33:11.990
It acted like a slingshot.

1572
01:33:11.992 --> 01:33:13.459
When she jumped back
into this dimension.

1573
01:33:13.461 --> 01:33:15.060
the vacuum created
by the centripetal force

1574
01:33:15.062 --> 01:33:16.962
closed the loop.

1575
01:33:16.964 --> 01:33:20.433
Who throws away
a perfectly good churro?

1576
01:33:20.435 --> 01:33:23.170
Oh. no. don't.

1577
01:33:30.612 --> 01:33:32.980
Uh-oh. This looks bad.

1578
01:33:34.449 --> 01:33:36.882
Ryan Phan?

1579
01:33:36.884 --> 01:33:38.283
Uh. maybe.

1580
01:33:38.285 --> 01:33:40.620
I'm Dr. Isaac Parker.
I'm here on behalf of DARPA.

1581
01:33:40.622 --> 01:33:42.622
We'd appreciate it
if you'd come with us

1582
01:33:42.624 --> 01:33:44.524
to answer some questions.

1583
01:33:44.526 --> 01:33:45.658
All of you.

1584
01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:46.860
Are we in trouble?

1585
01:33:48.463 --> 01:33:50.898
Please. right this way.

1586
01:34:01.942 --> 01:34:04.276
Dr. Kalibato to Robotics.

1587
01:34:04.278 --> 01:34:07.549
Dr. Kalibato to Robotics.

1588
01:34:17.592 --> 01:34:19.224
Holy shit.

1589
01:34:19.226 --> 01:34:20.560
Sissy.

1590
01:34:20.562 --> 01:34:22.495
Hope you don't mind us
borrowing her.

1591
01:34:22.497 --> 01:34:25.230
What you've created here
is truly remarkable.

1592
01:34:25.232 --> 01:34:27.366
Suck it. Dean Bronson.

1593
01:34:27.368 --> 01:34:29.669
We've been having
some difficulties

1594
01:34:29.671 --> 01:34:32.104
understanding
how the device operates.

1595
01:34:32.106 --> 01:34:34.139
We figured you could help.

1596
01:34:34.141 --> 01:34:35.273
There's so many different
algorithms.

1597
01:34:35.275 --> 01:34:37.109
It'll be tough to find
the right one to make it work.

1598
01:34:37.111 --> 01:34:39.146
I might be able
to help with that.

1599
01:34:40.314 --> 01:34:41.514
Great.

1600
01:34:41.516 --> 01:34:43.449
So. we just need to find
a test subject.

1601
01:34:43.451 --> 01:34:46.452
Wait. you... you want to trap
somebody in a time loop?

1602
01:34:46.454 --> 01:34:48.021
That's messed up.

1603
01:34:49.356 --> 01:34:51.024
Unless they deserve it.

1604
01:34:56.263 --> 01:34:59.699
I think I have
the perfect recruit.
