00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.583
<i>I was sleeping peacefully</i>
<i>in the midst of a long. long darkness.</i>

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.791
<i>It's good to sleep</i>
<i>when you can't find an answer.</i>

6
00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:35.458
<i>So I just slept.</i>

7
00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.208
<i>For months.</i>

8
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.583
<i>Then I was pulled toward a light.</i>

9
00:00:44.458 --> 00:00:45.541
<i>but life</i>

10
00:00:46.375 --> 00:00:47.666
<i>wanted me back.</i>

11
00:00:57.916 --> 00:00:58.833
Fırat?

12
00:01:00.583 --> 00:01:01.583
Fırat?

13
00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:03.958
Son!

14
00:01:06.375 --> 00:01:07.291
Salih!

15
00:01:08.291 --> 00:01:10.000
Oh. Fırat!

16
00:01:10.083 --> 00:01:11.000
Oh!

17
00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:13.166
-Oh!
-Fırat?

18
00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:16.958
Son. are you okay?

19
00:01:21.375 --> 00:01:24.583
I love you. son. I love you.

20
00:02:01.375 --> 00:02:02.208
Mom?

21
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.833
Huh?

22
00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:06.750
Yeah? Yes. dear. Tell me. my darling.

23
00:02:15.666 --> 00:02:17.250
What happened to the others?

24
00:02:25.083 --> 00:02:25.958
Tell me.

25
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.500
ISTANBUL. ONE YEAR BEFORE…

26
00:02:42.416 --> 00:02:45.333
So not one single person
in our city died this week. huh?

27
00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:49.291
Not a single soul shared
their tragic losses with us?

28
00:02:52.916 --> 00:02:56.083
How many people die in this city
every day? Any of you actually know that?

29
00:02:58.083 --> 00:02:59.875
Huh? No?

30
00:03:00.375 --> 00:03:03.750
You know. this is our livelihood.
And you don't even know the answer?

31
00:03:03.833 --> 00:03:06.083
Well. I'll tell you. It's 210.

32
00:03:06.166 --> 00:03:07.916
That's the average amount of deaths daily.

33
00:03:08.416 --> 00:03:10.750
Melda. can you multiply 7 by 210 for me.

34
00:03:10.833 --> 00:03:14.583
-I. uh. in my head. you mean?
-However you see fit.

35
00:03:14.666 --> 00:03:16.750
Uh… Seven. two. 14… 14

36
00:03:16.833 --> 00:03:19.500
and seven times that makes 1470. 1470.

37
00:03:19.583 --> 00:03:21.875
-Thank you. It is 1470.
-1470.

38
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.791
1470 people die every week.

39
00:03:25.875 --> 00:03:27.750
and we can't even get one obituary?

40
00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:31.000
You know. Açar Advertising upstairs
are all over billboards. and us?

41
00:03:31.083 --> 00:03:33.666
OUR TRAGIC LOSS

42
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:36.500
We're folding right now.

43
00:03:38.125 --> 00:03:39.916
I mean. newspapers are dying. you know?

44
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.458
-Huh?
-Newspapers are dying. Fırat.

45
00:03:47.916 --> 00:03:49.541
So you're saying
this is our last obituary?

46
00:03:52.333 --> 00:03:53.291
Maybe.

47
00:04:12.541 --> 00:04:13.875
Come on. Come on. well?

48
00:04:15.875 --> 00:04:16.875
That's it. It's over.

49
00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.500
It's done. We're shutting down.

50
00:04:18.583 --> 00:04:21.541
What can I do now?
It didn't work out. guys.

51
00:04:22.041 --> 00:04:23.791
I know that I owe you money.

52
00:04:24.291 --> 00:04:25.458
And I owe money to the state.

53
00:04:25.541 --> 00:04:27.875
which I'll take care of
as quickly as possible. all right?

54
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.666
Don't hold it against me.

55
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.625
-We won't.
-Of course this…

56
00:04:34.416 --> 00:04:36.083
This failure has nothing to do with you.

57
00:04:36.166 --> 00:04:37.791
This is all entirely my own fault.

58
00:04:37.875 --> 00:04:38.833
It's not your fault.

59
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.250
FIRAT AD AGENCY

60
00:04:48.333 --> 00:04:49.708
<i> I talked to the guys.</i>

61
00:04:49.791 --> 00:04:53.000
No one's putting the squeeze on you.
Just. whenever you sort things out…

62
00:04:55.083 --> 00:04:55.958
All right?

63
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Ah. hey.

64
00:05:00.083 --> 00:05:03.541
Listen. Serhat and I.
we found a festival that we're going to.

65
00:05:03.625 --> 00:05:05.250
Maybe you should come with us. huh?

66
00:05:05.333 --> 00:05:07.416
Yeah. 'cause I'm in the perfect mood
for a festival.

67
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.833
So much to celebrate.

68
00:05:08.916 --> 00:05:10.333
It's not a celebration.

69
00:05:10.416 --> 00:05:12.833
It's like yoga and stuff. I don't know…

70
00:05:12.916 --> 00:05:14.458
I just thought it could be good for you.

71
00:05:14.541 --> 00:05:16.458
You might like to blow off some steam.

72
00:05:16.541 --> 00:05:18.041
I'm already blowing off steam.

73
00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.291
Please don't be so hard on yourself. okay?

74
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.500
Look at me. Listen.

75
00:05:27.333 --> 00:05:29.916
Come on. Get up.
You're totally down in the dumps.

76
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.250
Okay. take this one. It's finished.
We'll put the rest in boxes.

77
00:05:39.333 --> 00:05:42.500
Oh. by the way. Serhat made
a crazy amount of money from Bitcoin.

78
00:05:42.583 --> 00:05:43.958
You know that. right?

79
00:05:44.041 --> 00:05:45.666
-Uh. and?
-I don't know.

80
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.750
Just maybe if you could stay
on his good side. he might lend you some.

81
00:05:48.833 --> 00:05:51.083
Come on. stop it.
I can't ask anyone for money.

82
00:05:51.583 --> 00:05:54.458
All right. Fırat. All right.
What can I say? Okay.

83
00:05:54.541 --> 00:05:57.958
Let's just hope your creditors have
the same mindset as you.

84
00:05:58.041 --> 00:05:59.625
-Wait a second. Come back.
-Huh?

85
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.416
How much money did he actually make?

86
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.125
Bitcoin-wise. I mean.

87
00:06:06.708 --> 00:06:08.791
Let me get you some coffee. Yeah? Yeah.

88
00:06:08.875 --> 00:06:09.916
Come on.

89
00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.458
Dude. come on.
Just buy it. Go ahead.

90
00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:18.416
Look. you just can't make any money
without taking some risks.

91
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.416
It's a simple concept.
Why don't you understand?

92
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.750
Want some? Hey.

93
00:06:21.833 --> 00:06:25.166
People who don't take risks
can never win in life. Don't forget that.

94
00:06:26.208 --> 00:06:28.416
-Come on. Come on. I know. man.
-Hey.

95
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.375
Eat something.

96
00:06:29.875 --> 00:06:32.625
All right. Okay. Okay. Of course.
Buy the small ones as well.

97
00:06:33.208 --> 00:06:35.291
Ripple and everything.
Yes. get all of them.

98
00:06:35.375 --> 00:06:38.125
Got that? Hello? Hello?

99
00:06:38.208 --> 00:06:39.666
That one. Yeah. That's right.

100
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:41.250
Great. Okay.

101
00:06:41.333 --> 00:06:42.875
We'll do it like that. then.

102
00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.375
Is he always on the phone?

103
00:06:44.458 --> 00:06:47.333
-Got it boss.
-No. he just got carried away today.

104
00:06:47.416 --> 00:06:49.791
-I don't get it.
-All he talks about is damn money.

105
00:06:49.875 --> 00:06:51.916
He actually has a really big heart.
you know?

106
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.250
-Oh. does he? How much did he get it for?
-Uh-huh.

107
00:06:54.333 --> 00:06:55.958
Ugh. Fırat.

108
00:06:56.041 --> 00:06:59.541
…according to what they said
in court. it's on February 9.

109
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.166
Hello? Yes. we got disconnected.

110
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.416
You were saying end of February.
Got it. Thank you very much. sir.

111
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.458
I'll see you then. See you then.

112
00:07:17.416 --> 00:07:18.291
Hello?

113
00:07:18.375 --> 00:07:20.958
<i>Hey. man. if you're not too busy.</i>
<i>can we chat as well?</i>

114
00:07:21.458 --> 00:07:23.875
-What's that now?
-It's me. Fırat. from the backseat.

115
00:07:27.166 --> 00:07:28.125
What? What's up?

116
00:07:28.875 --> 00:07:29.750
Good one!

117
00:07:33.291 --> 00:07:35.583
What? You deserved that.

118
00:07:36.541 --> 00:07:39.083
He's outrageous.

119
00:08:02.541 --> 00:08:03.583
Hey. what's up?

120
00:08:03.666 --> 00:08:04.541
Let's go.

121
00:08:05.541 --> 00:08:07.875
Are we seriously gonna do yoga
for three days?

122
00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.125
-Well. yeah.
-For three days?

123
00:08:09.208 --> 00:08:10.125
What's wrong with that?

124
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.583
You said it was a festival.
Why not let other people do it?

125
00:08:13.666 --> 00:08:14.500
We could watch.

126
00:08:14.583 --> 00:08:17.833
I promised I'd go to the first class.
Don't know about the second. Do the same.

127
00:08:19.291 --> 00:08:20.250
Oh. who's calling?

128
00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:21.666
Oh God. Serhat!

129
00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.041
-What's going on?
-Look at me.

130
00:08:23.125 --> 00:08:24.916
If you don't leave that phone
back in the room.

131
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.625
I'm absolutely going to smash it.

132
00:08:26.708 --> 00:08:29.000
Come on! What's the matter with you?
Calm down. Relax.

133
00:08:29.083 --> 00:08:31.208
We came here to meditate.
to be calm. Remember?

134
00:08:31.291 --> 00:08:32.500
Calm.

135
00:08:32.583 --> 00:08:34.666
-Okay. I'm off. See you guys later.
-What did he say?

136
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.958
-He said to meditate?
-Mm-hmm.

137
00:08:37.041 --> 00:08:38.458
Where the hell did you bring me?

138
00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:42.458
Melda. let's talk to him about the money.
and I'll head out tomorrow. Please?

139
00:08:42.541 --> 00:08:44.166
Don't be ridiculous. Fırat. Come on!

140
00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.041
-For once. just live in the moment.
-Come on!

141
00:08:47.125 --> 00:08:49.833
Look. forget about everything
and come with me.

142
00:08:49.916 --> 00:08:51.125
It's just the first night.

143
00:08:51.208 --> 00:08:55.166
There's fun stuff like dancing.
The first class is at sunrise tomorrow.

144
00:08:56.375 --> 00:08:57.708
-You said at sunrise?
-Uh-huh.

145
00:08:57.791 --> 00:08:58.958
What time is that?

146
00:09:01.125 --> 00:09:02.583
As most of you already know.

147
00:09:02.666 --> 00:09:05.375
we start everything we do
with an intention. right?

148
00:09:05.458 --> 00:09:07.833
Because that intention
triggers that action.

149
00:09:08.916 --> 00:09:12.500
We shall dedicate our work tonight
to the purification of our soul.

150
00:09:12.583 --> 00:09:14.791
From time and all material life.

151
00:09:15.625 --> 00:09:17.500
First. we shall chant our mantra.

152
00:09:18.166 --> 00:09:20.291
Let me explain the meaning of the words

153
00:09:20.375 --> 00:09:22.333
as we have some new friends joining us.

154
00:09:22.416 --> 00:09:24.333
so we would not want to confuse them.

155
00:09:26.208 --> 00:09:28.333
Everyone and everything here

156
00:09:28.416 --> 00:09:30.666
is created from the earth and light.

157
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:32.958
We just need to focus on
the earth and light.

158
00:09:33.041 --> 00:09:34.666
Don't think about anything else tonight.

159
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.791
Yes. let's start with "Nirvana Shatakam."
But first.

160
00:09:37.875 --> 00:09:40.625
let's give a round of applause
for our musician friends here

161
00:09:40.708 --> 00:09:43.208
who will accompany us
with their wonderful singing.

162
00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:45.500
Yusuf. Lidya. and our <i>kirtan</i> team.

163
00:10:24.375 --> 00:10:26.166
The lyrics are like this.

164
00:10:26.875 --> 00:10:29.166
"I am not the mind."

165
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:30.750
"I am not the reason."

166
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.583
"I am not consciousness."

167
00:10:34.708 --> 00:10:36.375
"I am not the sky."

168
00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.416
"I am not the earth."

169
00:10:48.333 --> 00:10:50.166
"I am not the body."

170
00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:53.375
"I am not breath."

171
00:11:00.791 --> 00:11:04.333
"I am neither the known nor the unknown."

172
00:11:04.416 --> 00:11:08.208
"I am neither visible nor invisible."

173
00:11:47.625 --> 00:11:48.791
<i>You know what?</i>

174
00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:51.375
<i>This place is</i>
<i>already making me feel better.</i>

175
00:11:51.458 --> 00:11:52.625
You guys?

176
00:11:53.166 --> 00:11:55.541
Well… "I'm not anything." right?

177
00:11:56.083 --> 00:11:59.250
The English version of that song they sang
is even stranger than the Hindi.

178
00:11:59.333 --> 00:12:02.291
What was it even called?
"Nirvana Shakitan"? "Shakatan"?

179
00:12:02.375 --> 00:12:04.125
Did you really not understand it at all?

180
00:12:04.208 --> 00:12:05.666
Well. did you get it. smarty-pants?

181
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:07.750
Of course I got it. Serhat!

182
00:12:07.833 --> 00:12:10.208
Everything is created
from the earth and light.

183
00:12:10.291 --> 00:12:11.875
What's not to understand about that?

184
00:12:12.375 --> 00:12:14.791
Also. did you know that woman
is super famous?

185
00:12:14.875 --> 00:12:16.875
She talks to the dead or something.
To the dead!

186
00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.250
-To the dead?
-Yeah. she does!

187
00:12:18.333 --> 00:12:19.500
No way. That's pure bull.

188
00:12:19.583 --> 00:12:21.166
I don't care. Believe whatever you want.

189
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:24.958
"I am neither the known nor the unknown."
Like. what was up with that?

190
00:12:25.041 --> 00:12:27.333
Fırat. hey. did you really understand
any of that?

191
00:12:27.416 --> 00:12:29.625
Honestly. not at all.
but that girl's voice was beautiful.

192
00:12:29.708 --> 00:12:31.541
-What?
-Did you at least understand the intent?

193
00:12:31.625 --> 00:12:32.541
Of course you didn't.

194
00:12:32.625 --> 00:12:35.375
She says that the intent of all of this
is to save our souls

195
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.375
from the material world for at least…

196
00:12:38.458 --> 00:12:42.166
To save our souls from the material world
for at least three days on this retreat.

197
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:43.458
What's not to understand?

198
00:12:43.541 --> 00:12:45.958
Come on.
I think you can understand that. guys.

199
00:12:46.041 --> 00:12:48.500
You just need to be spiritual
for two minutes. That's it.

200
00:12:48.583 --> 00:12:51.458
What happened? Why is she upset now?
Wait. Where are you going?

201
00:12:53.041 --> 00:12:54.500
Don't worry. Mom.

202
00:12:54.583 --> 00:12:55.791
I'm really happy.

203
00:12:55.875 --> 00:12:58.166
I told you.
I'm very happy with my life right now.

204
00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:00.041
And I'm not coming back.

205
00:13:01.041 --> 00:13:02.208
Why are you doing this?

206
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:04.500
Oh. Mom. stop.
Why are you crying right now?

207
00:13:06.583 --> 00:13:10.625
Mom. tell me. why are you getting so upset
about things that don't even upset me?

208
00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:12.083
Yes.

209
00:13:12.583 --> 00:13:13.875
Okay. that's it. I'm hanging up.

210
00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958
No. I don't want to talk right now.

211
00:13:16.041 --> 00:13:17.375
I don't want to. Mom.

212
00:13:17.458 --> 00:13:20.208
You need to respect that.
I don't want to talk anymore. all right?

213
00:13:23.125 --> 00:13:23.958
Shit!

214
00:13:32.791 --> 00:13:34.916
Oh. it's okay. You don't have to do that.

215
00:13:35.708 --> 00:13:37.375
Well. you shouldn't have thrown it.

216
00:13:38.583 --> 00:13:40.000
It landed here somewhere. but…

217
00:13:43.875 --> 00:13:46.000
You know what?
Why don't you give me your number.

218
00:13:46.083 --> 00:13:47.291
and I'll call it from my phone?

219
00:13:47.375 --> 00:13:50.333
Oh. okay. All right. Here. Thank you.

220
00:13:56.583 --> 00:13:57.416
Here you go.

221
00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.208
-Was it on silent mode or something?
-No. It'll ring. Or…

222
00:14:00.291 --> 00:14:02.583
At least it's gonna light up. I guess.
I don't know.

223
00:14:04.458 --> 00:14:06.166
It's coming from here.

224
00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:07.166
Ah!

225
00:14:07.708 --> 00:14:08.916
Ah! There it is.

226
00:14:09.791 --> 00:14:10.791
Thank you.

227
00:14:11.625 --> 00:14:13.541
-Are you okay?
-I'm feeling better. I think.

228
00:14:14.291 --> 00:14:16.500
I mean. I was this close
to throwing it into the water.

229
00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.375
You were just singing
the most peaceful meditative songs

230
00:14:21.458 --> 00:14:22.333
and now what?

231
00:14:23.125 --> 00:14:24.000
Yeah.

232
00:14:25.041 --> 00:14:26.750
In there. we become
the people we want to be.

233
00:14:26.833 --> 00:14:28.708
but out here it's not the same.

234
00:14:33.541 --> 00:14:34.958
I'm Fırat. by the way.

235
00:14:35.791 --> 00:14:38.416
I thought I should give you
my name to hold onto.

236
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.666
so the next time you get angry.
you can throw it away.

237
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:44.583
And I'm Lidya.

238
00:14:44.666 --> 00:14:46.083
-Lidya.
-Yeah.

239
00:14:46.708 --> 00:14:48.250
Just don't throw my name in the water.

240
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.666
Thank you again. I mean it. seriously.

241
00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:57.041
Uh… What stage are you in?

242
00:14:59.375 --> 00:15:01.500
-Yoga stage. I mean.
-Oh.

243
00:15:02.458 --> 00:15:04.583
-I write music and I sing. actually.
-Oh.

244
00:15:04.666 --> 00:15:07.958
But sometimes I get offers to perform
for organizations like this one. so…

245
00:15:08.041 --> 00:15:08.875
I see.

246
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.166
The pay's not so good. but the work is.

247
00:15:12.666 --> 00:15:14.875
I don't have to pay for the camp.
so that's great.

248
00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.458
You know. I…

249
00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:20.625
I really wanted to play the <i>darbuka</i>
when I was a kid.

250
00:15:20.708 --> 00:15:23.750
Of course percussion wasn't a thing
in our neighborhood.

251
00:15:23.833 --> 00:15:26.291
If I'd have known.
I'd have chosen something cooler.

252
00:15:27.208 --> 00:15:29.583
And? So what ended up happening?

253
00:15:30.208 --> 00:15:32.000
I mean. after you grew up.

254
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:34.500
What happened was I…

255
00:15:34.583 --> 00:15:36.833
I closed my business two days ago.

256
00:15:36.916 --> 00:15:39.000
I had an advertising thing.

257
00:15:39.083 --> 00:15:40.375
An agency of some sort.

258
00:15:41.041 --> 00:15:42.750
So I guess when I grew up.
I went into debt.

259
00:15:42.833 --> 00:15:44.000
I understand.

260
00:15:46.333 --> 00:15:47.875
I'm just going to go ahead and ask

261
00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.125
because you don't really look like a yogi.

262
00:15:50.208 --> 00:15:51.541
-How did you end up here?
-I…

263
00:15:53.875 --> 00:15:55.875
I guess I came to find peace with yoga.

264
00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:58.166
-A friend made me come here.
-Friend?

265
00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:00.625
You could say I'm doing yoga
to try to get a loan.

266
00:16:00.708 --> 00:16:02.375
but it's a little complicated.

267
00:16:02.458 --> 00:16:04.250
Okay. I see. That does sound complicated.

268
00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:06.750
-Lidya!
-Huh?

269
00:16:07.458 --> 00:16:08.916
Hey. come here.

270
00:16:09.625 --> 00:16:10.458
Hello.

271
00:16:11.541 --> 00:16:12.375
Hello. there.

272
00:16:13.291 --> 00:16:14.125
Yusuf.

273
00:16:14.625 --> 00:16:15.791
Fırat.

274
00:16:18.333 --> 00:16:19.666
Thanks for your help again.

275
00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:21.166
-Nice to meet you.
-You're welcome.

276
00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:23.250
-See you around.
-See you around.

277
00:16:23.333 --> 00:16:25.458
-Where have you been?
-I'm right here.

278
00:16:27.791 --> 00:16:28.958
What are you doing?

279
00:16:37.708 --> 00:16:38.833
Fırat.

280
00:16:38.916 --> 00:16:41.166
-Do you know there's no meat here?
-What?

281
00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.041
There's no meat. Nothing on the menu.

282
00:16:43.125 --> 00:16:44.333
Okay. and so what?

283
00:16:44.416 --> 00:16:46.083
No. I mean throughout the whole camp.

284
00:16:46.583 --> 00:16:48.625
-Throughout the entire campground?
-Yeah.

285
00:16:48.708 --> 00:16:52.083
-But why not?
-It decreases our mental capacity.

286
00:16:54.541 --> 00:16:55.791
Even<i> İskender </i>kebab?

287
00:16:56.416 --> 00:16:57.541
I guess that too. man.

288
00:17:01.916 --> 00:17:03.291
Hey. listen. Serhat.

289
00:17:03.875 --> 00:17:06.416
-You know about this thing. Bitcoin?
-What about it?

290
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.250
People keep mentioning it.
but I can't make any sense of it.

291
00:17:09.333 --> 00:17:10.291
How does it work?

292
00:17:10.916 --> 00:17:13.166
Listen. Let me explain what Bitcoin is.

293
00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:15.166
So what is money?

294
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.416
-Tell me. what is money?
-<i>That's how he started.</i>

295
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:19.958
<i>He talked all night.</i>

296
00:17:20.041 --> 00:17:22.333
<i>I couldn't even bring up</i>
<i>the subject of a loan.</i>

297
00:18:14.583 --> 00:18:17.875
<i>Nothing achieved</i>
<i>through effort brings happiness.</i>

298
00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:19.333
<i>Working is enough.</i>

299
00:18:19.416 --> 00:18:21.333
<i>No effort is needed.</i>

300
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:26.041
<i>We don't need to spend all our time</i>
<i>trying to achieve our goals.</i>

301
00:18:26.708 --> 00:18:28.333
<i>Goals enslave us.</i>

302
00:18:30.041 --> 00:18:32.000
<i>When we finally reach that goal one day.</i>

303
00:18:32.083 --> 00:18:36.500
<i>we see that we have wasted our whole life</i>
<i>with our ambitions.</i>

304
00:18:36.583 --> 00:18:38.625
<i>While trying to achieve that goal.</i>

305
00:18:38.708 --> 00:18:41.000
<i>we missed the most valuable thing.</i>

306
00:18:41.083 --> 00:18:42.708
<i>the road to it.</i>

307
00:18:44.416 --> 00:18:47.375
<i>Getting to our destination</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

308
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.625
<i>That's our only concern.</i>

309
00:18:52.333 --> 00:18:55.375
<i>But one day. when you can look</i>
<i>at yourself in the mirror</i>

310
00:18:55.875 --> 00:18:58.625
<i>and say "I love you" wholeheartedly.</i>

311
00:18:58.708 --> 00:18:59.791
<i>then that day.</i>

312
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:04.916
<i>that day.</i>
<i>you are ready to love someone else.</i>

313
00:19:07.208 --> 00:19:09.041
<i>Just look inside.</i>

314
00:19:09.125 --> 00:19:10.791
Always look inside.

315
00:19:12.083 --> 00:19:13.666
Enough looking outside.

316
00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.250
Take the leap and look inside yourself.

317
00:19:16.333 --> 00:19:18.958
<i>I</i> <i>looked inside myself</i>
<i>and immediately remembered</i>

318
00:19:19.041 --> 00:19:21.000
<i>that I'm about 150.000 in debt.</i>

319
00:20:37.125 --> 00:20:39.375
I'd like to make
an interesting announcement

320
00:20:39.458 --> 00:20:40.708
to all of you now.

321
00:20:42.458 --> 00:20:46.333
History is a cycle. not a repetition.

322
00:20:46.416 --> 00:20:48.083
Please remember that.

323
00:20:48.166 --> 00:20:51.375
When we look to the sky.
we are told what will happen.

324
00:20:52.166 --> 00:20:54.708
And these days.

325
00:20:54.791 --> 00:20:57.583
the stars are not giving us
very good news. unfortunately.

326
00:20:58.458 --> 00:21:01.666
Troubled. very troubled days will come.

327
00:21:02.458 --> 00:21:04.000
They will last a long while.

328
00:21:04.083 --> 00:21:05.416
But the Doom of Love

329
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.750
will follow soon after.

330
00:21:07.833 --> 00:21:12.291
And those who dare to seek the truth
will meet there on that blessed day.

331
00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:18.916
Signs are important.

332
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.750
It's also important
to understand that a sign is a sign still.

333
00:21:24.791 --> 00:21:26.833
And on that very day.

334
00:21:26.916 --> 00:21:30.500
those who swim with the flow
will get there without any effort.

335
00:21:31.125 --> 00:21:32.333
But others

336
00:21:32.416 --> 00:21:34.250
will fight the current.

337
00:21:35.791 --> 00:21:36.833
Goodbye.

338
00:21:37.583 --> 00:21:40.083
I hope to see every one of you
in the Doom of Love.

339
00:21:44.083 --> 00:21:45.208
Whoa.

340
00:21:48.708 --> 00:21:50.750
So what is she saying is going to happen?

341
00:21:51.416 --> 00:21:54.166
I didn't get it. but I'm trying
not to make it obvious in case--

342
00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:55.541
-What is--
-Hey. you two!

343
00:21:55.625 --> 00:21:57.541
Keep it down.
I'm trying to do some thinking!

344
00:21:58.291 --> 00:21:59.375
You're thinking?

345
00:23:52.958 --> 00:23:55.083
Dude. listen to me.

346
00:23:55.166 --> 00:23:56.500
Just make the offer and wait.

347
00:23:56.583 --> 00:23:58.125
Don't call me. Wait.

348
00:23:58.208 --> 00:23:59.333
Exactly. You just wait.

349
00:23:59.416 --> 00:24:01.750
The meat's great. You guys want some?

350
00:24:02.333 --> 00:24:03.708
Fırat. meat?

351
00:24:03.791 --> 00:24:05.500
-No? Come on. Have some.
-No.

352
00:24:05.583 --> 00:24:07.583
Suit yourselves.
Like I care. It's really good.

353
00:24:07.666 --> 00:24:10.041
I haven't eaten meat in so long.
my legs were shaking.

354
00:24:10.125 --> 00:24:11.583
-Unbelievable.
-Lay it on.

355
00:24:12.083 --> 00:24:13.000
Hello?

356
00:24:13.083 --> 00:24:15.833
What did you do about the thing.
the building in Tophane?

357
00:24:17.458 --> 00:24:19.875
Find its owner!
What do you mean you couldn't?

358
00:24:20.791 --> 00:24:22.666
Okay. Hang up. I'll call you in a minute.

359
00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:24.916
Hang on.
I'm getting another call. Hang up.

360
00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:26.583
Yes. hello?

361
00:24:26.666 --> 00:24:28.458
<i>Serhat? Hi. it's me. Fırat.</i>

362
00:24:34.875 --> 00:24:37.458
-Did I actually fall for that again?
-Please don't hang up.

363
00:24:37.541 --> 00:24:40.291
This way is much easier for both of us.
I have something I need to ask.

364
00:24:40.958 --> 00:24:41.791
I…

365
00:24:42.583 --> 00:24:43.625
I need some money

366
00:24:43.708 --> 00:24:46.375
and wondered if maybe
you could help me out to pay my debt.

367
00:24:47.041 --> 00:24:49.541
Is what I was going to say.
but never mind.

368
00:24:50.125 --> 00:24:51.958
Actually. forget I even called you. Sorry.

369
00:24:52.041 --> 00:24:53.833
All right. Well.
how much money would you need?

370
00:24:55.458 --> 00:24:56.291
Well.

371
00:24:56.958 --> 00:24:58.041
it's a lot.

372
00:24:58.708 --> 00:25:00.500
But how much are you willing to give me?

373
00:25:00.583 --> 00:25:01.625
But what do you owe?

374
00:25:02.333 --> 00:25:04.458
-Melda didn't tell you?
-No. I did tell him.

375
00:25:04.541 --> 00:25:06.625
-She told me.
-Then why are you asking me again?

376
00:25:06.708 --> 00:25:09.833
-You're making me feel terrible.
-Now. that money is all tied up.

377
00:25:10.625 --> 00:25:12.958
It's not due yet.
but I can probably loan you 10.000.

378
00:25:13.041 --> 00:25:14.791
-That should be more than enough.
-Thirty.

379
00:25:14.875 --> 00:25:18.291
-What?
-I mean 30.000.

380
00:25:18.375 --> 00:25:21.291
30.000. Why not? Let's at least
pay the salaries. right. Fırat?

381
00:25:21.375 --> 00:25:22.583
Serhat.

382
00:25:22.666 --> 00:25:25.500
Some of it is going to come back
to our account. Think of it like that.

383
00:25:25.583 --> 00:25:27.666
-My salary's going to come back.
-30.000?

384
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.083
-Isn't 30 a bit too much?
-Oh.

385
00:25:31.166 --> 00:25:33.291
Okay. All right. 30.000.

386
00:25:33.375 --> 00:25:35.291
I'll transfer it to your account
once we get back.

387
00:25:35.375 --> 00:25:37.750
Oh. thank you so much. man. Seriously.

388
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.125
I guess I'll call you back sometime soon.

389
00:25:41.208 --> 00:25:42.166
He jokes.

390
00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:43.541
He jokes too.

391
00:25:58.791 --> 00:26:00.083
How are you. Mom?

392
00:26:00.166 --> 00:26:02.333
<i>I'm good. I'm good.</i> <i>Okay.</i>

393
00:26:02.416 --> 00:26:03.916
<i>How are you?</i>

394
00:26:04.875 --> 00:26:07.500
I'm good. Mom. It's all good.

395
00:26:07.583 --> 00:26:10.125
<i>Great. As long as you're okay.</i>

396
00:26:10.208 --> 00:26:12.375
<i>Tell me a number between one and 40.</i>

397
00:26:12.458 --> 00:26:15.083
Uh. don't ask me.
You know I'm no good with numbers.

398
00:26:15.166 --> 00:26:16.791
Here. Take this. Ask your son.

399
00:26:16.875 --> 00:26:19.083
I was asking him anyway.

400
00:26:19.166 --> 00:26:20.000
Hello?

401
00:26:22.291 --> 00:26:23.500
One second. Dad.

402
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:24.958
What's up. man?

403
00:26:25.041 --> 00:26:27.041
Tell me a number between one and 40.

404
00:26:27.541 --> 00:26:29.708
-Why? Is Dad asking?
-As always.

405
00:26:30.208 --> 00:26:31.083
You okay?

406
00:26:32.083 --> 00:26:35.250
Should I describe the state I'm in
with a number between one and 40?

407
00:26:35.333 --> 00:26:36.166
Let's say zero.

408
00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:38.500
All right.
Come by the office tomorrow. then.

409
00:26:38.583 --> 00:26:41.541
-İrfan. that job's not really for me.
-Stop talking.

410
00:26:41.625 --> 00:26:44.958
And come first thing in the morning.
Okay? I'll be waiting for you.

411
00:26:50.916 --> 00:26:52.750
Hello? Thirty-two. Dad.

412
00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:55.250
Thirty-two? All right. then.

413
00:26:58.958 --> 00:27:00.416
Thirty-two.

414
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:04.916
First of all. you're not in a position
to look down on any job.

415
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.833
Second. your house is gonna be seized.

416
00:27:07.916 --> 00:27:10.000
I mean. those two are practically
the same thing.

417
00:27:10.083 --> 00:27:10.916
Huh?

418
00:27:11.833 --> 00:27:13.458
Nothing. Never mind. Just go on.

419
00:27:15.291 --> 00:27:16.916
Okay. you're not the smartest.

420
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.500
but at least
you're a decent-looking fellow. right?

421
00:27:20.083 --> 00:27:22.583
You can use your silver tongue
to persuade people.

422
00:27:22.666 --> 00:27:25.833
Doctors need to understand
they should prescribe our drugs

423
00:27:25.916 --> 00:27:27.541
as opposed to our competitors' drugs.

424
00:27:27.625 --> 00:27:29.000
You'll make that happen.

425
00:27:30.375 --> 00:27:32.458
Use the freebies we give you accordingly.

426
00:27:32.541 --> 00:27:36.000
But you also need to make sure that
every health institution in this country

427
00:27:36.083 --> 00:27:38.166
has a copy of our planner. All of them.

428
00:27:38.833 --> 00:27:40.666
Oh. and we had those phone things made.

429
00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:43.666
Open it and it somehow stands upright.
You know. circular?

430
00:27:44.791 --> 00:27:45.791
It goes through it.

431
00:27:46.291 --> 00:27:48.333
Look. if they cop out.

432
00:27:48.416 --> 00:27:50.291
just give them two
or three pens and leave.

433
00:27:50.791 --> 00:27:52.583
You can always just go somewhere else.

434
00:27:53.458 --> 00:27:54.541
Want some hazelnuts?

435
00:27:54.625 --> 00:27:56.041
-No. thank you.
-Have some.

436
00:27:56.125 --> 00:27:58.625
-Thanks. I don't want any.
-Why? Aren't you hungry?

437
00:28:05.083 --> 00:28:07.291
First. we're going to Marmaris
for a seminar.

438
00:28:07.958 --> 00:28:09.166
Pack your suitcase.

439
00:28:19.958 --> 00:28:22.958
HEALTH COMES FIRST
AJN PHARMACEUTICALS

440
00:28:35.416 --> 00:28:38.791
Dear guests.
I would first like to welcome all of you.

441
00:28:38.875 --> 00:28:43.125
This year. all of our representatives are
trying to raise our brand to the highest…

442
00:28:43.833 --> 00:28:46.416
As some of our friends
worked harder than others…

443
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.458
…the third-highest sales figures…

444
00:28:48.541 --> 00:28:50.458
They've done their best.

445
00:28:50.541 --> 00:28:55.250
So now. I would like to call
Mr. Beşir Fulya onto the stage.

446
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:59.375
I wish you continued success.

447
00:30:44.791 --> 00:30:45.625
Ferit?

448
00:30:46.291 --> 00:30:47.125
Not Ferit.

449
00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:49.083
Fırat!

450
00:30:50.291 --> 00:30:51.333
Yes!

451
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.958
Good thing you didn't throw away my name.

452
00:30:54.041 --> 00:30:55.166
Of course. What's up?

453
00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:56.458
I'm good. And you guys?

454
00:30:57.041 --> 00:30:59.000
We're all good. Just lobbying over here.

455
00:30:59.083 --> 00:31:01.250
They just had us come here to sing today.

456
00:31:06.875 --> 00:31:09.625
So actually.
the first encounter doesn't matter.

457
00:31:09.708 --> 00:31:10.708
It's just a coincidence.

458
00:31:10.791 --> 00:31:13.333
It's the second encounter
that's called synchronicity.

459
00:31:14.541 --> 00:31:17.041
-Who said that? Doesn't sound like you.
-My grandma.

460
00:31:17.125 --> 00:31:19.750
-I like that a lot. man.
-Right? Thank you.

461
00:31:20.666 --> 00:31:21.958
What are you doing here?

462
00:31:22.041 --> 00:31:25.416
I got a job at a pharmaceutical company.
We're doing a seminar here.

463
00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.458
Turns out all the dealers
were away on vacation.

464
00:31:27.541 --> 00:31:28.791
That's funny.

465
00:31:30.041 --> 00:31:33.041
What are you selling?
What kinds of drugs are you offering?

466
00:31:33.125 --> 00:31:34.916
Stuff for ulcers. acid reflux.

467
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.291
-Some painkillers.
-Hmm.

468
00:31:37.333 --> 00:31:38.583
We have something for everyone.

469
00:31:39.875 --> 00:31:41.541
Doesn't sound appealing. does it?

470
00:31:41.625 --> 00:31:42.625
-Uh…
-Hmm…

471
00:31:44.375 --> 00:31:46.375
-I'm putting in the effort at least.
-The effort?

472
00:31:47.708 --> 00:31:49.250
Effort. Yeah. I am.

473
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:52.041
I still don't understand that.
Everything she said.

474
00:31:52.125 --> 00:31:54.750
I mean. how do you achieve something
without any effort?

475
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:57.750
Well. it depends.
What do you want to achieve?

476
00:31:58.500 --> 00:31:59.916
An income. I guess.

477
00:32:00.791 --> 00:32:02.416
Perhaps a livelihood.

478
00:32:03.416 --> 00:32:04.791
Can I ask you something?

479
00:32:05.916 --> 00:32:07.458
Do you enjoy the work you're doing?

480
00:32:07.541 --> 00:32:09.875
Well. I'm pretty new to it. honestly. so…

481
00:32:11.583 --> 00:32:13.875
-What were you doing before?
-I had my own agency.

482
00:32:15.541 --> 00:32:17.875
-I was selling obituaries.
-Obituaries?

483
00:32:18.625 --> 00:32:20.041
Yeah. like in newspapers.

484
00:32:20.541 --> 00:32:21.791
"Our tragic loss…"

485
00:32:23.583 --> 00:32:26.000
-"Something."
-Wait. what? Seriously?

486
00:32:28.083 --> 00:32:29.916
-Aw. come on. That's very sweet.
-Very sweet.

487
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.750
-Please excuse us. So sweet.
-Sweet?

488
00:32:31.833 --> 00:32:34.125
-Sorry.
-We're not like…

489
00:32:34.208 --> 00:32:35.208
We're laughing.

490
00:32:35.291 --> 00:32:37.875
I mean. if you died laughing.
I'd make money.

491
00:32:38.625 --> 00:32:41.166
-Or I would have once.
-Yeah.

492
00:32:42.625 --> 00:32:43.625
Well. anyway…

493
00:32:44.125 --> 00:32:46.416
We should go.
Lots of work tonight. Soundcheck.

494
00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.875
-Soundcheck?
-There's a beach on the way to the forest.

495
00:32:48.958 --> 00:32:51.208
We have a gig tonight.
You should come join us.

496
00:32:51.291 --> 00:32:53.833
I can't come.
The company has a big event tonight.

497
00:32:53.916 --> 00:32:56.208
Hadise is singing.
and Beyazıt Öztürk will be there.

498
00:32:56.291 --> 00:32:59.333
Ah! I guess we're just not
quite at that level yet. right?

499
00:32:59.416 --> 00:33:02.458
-No. I have to be there for work.
-No. no.

500
00:33:02.541 --> 00:33:04.416
Anyway. you know where we'll be.

501
00:33:08.041 --> 00:33:09.125
-Good luck.
-Bye.

502
00:33:13.916 --> 00:33:17.125
You know. I think the second encounter
may not matter so much either.

503
00:33:17.625 --> 00:33:19.500
The real encounter is
probably the third one.

504
00:33:31.541 --> 00:33:32.375
Hello?

505
00:33:32.458 --> 00:33:35.291
<i>Hi Fırat.</i>
<i>I have pain in my joints.</i>

506
00:33:35.375 --> 00:33:38.625
<i>Which medicine would you recommend</i>
<i>that I take? </i>

507
00:33:39.166 --> 00:33:40.875
I recommend you dump Serhat.

508
00:33:40.958 --> 00:33:43.291
<i>Very funny.</i>

509
00:33:44.083 --> 00:33:45.375
What are you up to today?

510
00:33:45.458 --> 00:33:46.500
<i>Nothing much.</i>

511
00:33:46.583 --> 00:33:49.833
Remember that singer girl who we met
at the yoga camp together?

512
00:33:49.916 --> 00:33:51.000
<i>Yeah?</i>

513
00:33:51.083 --> 00:33:53.041
I ended up running into her today
at the seminar.

514
00:33:53.125 --> 00:33:55.125
Oh! No way! And?

515
00:33:55.208 --> 00:33:57.208
They have a gig out here
at some place tonight.

516
00:33:57.291 --> 00:33:58.625
She invited me to join.

517
00:33:58.708 --> 00:34:01.000
but it's the same time
as the big company event.

518
00:34:01.083 --> 00:34:03.583
If I don't show up.
I think I'll most definitely get fired.

519
00:34:05.291 --> 00:34:06.625
Did I tell you her name's Lidya?

520
00:34:06.708 --> 00:34:09.916
Lidya? Ooh!

521
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.791
Pretty name. Must be hard to not chase
after someone with the name Lidya.

522
00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:15.375
It's true.

523
00:34:16.583 --> 00:34:18.250
Hey. don't even think about it.

524
00:34:18.333 --> 00:34:19.833
Go for it. Do what makes you happy.

525
00:34:20.875 --> 00:34:23.583
So basically. you're telling me
I should just follow my heart?

526
00:34:23.666 --> 00:34:25.041
Exactly.

527
00:34:25.125 --> 00:34:27.291
Or take your heart wherever you go.

528
00:34:27.375 --> 00:34:28.208
<i>Same thing.</i>

529
00:34:29.916 --> 00:34:31.791
Have fun. sweetie. Be careful.

530
00:34:31.875 --> 00:34:34.416
-And let me know how things go tonight.
<i>-Okay.</i>

531
00:35:56.083 --> 00:35:56.958
Together now.

532
00:36:41.333 --> 00:36:44.041
Istanbul used to be the city
where everyone loved me.

533
00:36:44.125 --> 00:36:45.500
I had just finished school.

534
00:36:45.583 --> 00:36:47.541
And I was so passionate.

535
00:36:47.625 --> 00:36:50.541
I was determined. you know.
My career was going well.

536
00:36:50.625 --> 00:36:52.625
Nightlife was fun. Everything was fine.

537
00:36:53.291 --> 00:36:54.666
Then before I even knew it.

538
00:36:55.416 --> 00:36:56.375
it stopped.

539
00:36:57.791 --> 00:36:59.166
And then I started going backwards.

540
00:36:59.791 --> 00:37:01.375
I literally dropped down to zero.

541
00:37:01.458 --> 00:37:03.041
And then I fell into the negative.

542
00:37:03.125 --> 00:37:04.166
Into the negative?

543
00:37:06.833 --> 00:37:08.083
I got a lot of debt. Yusuf.

544
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.625
And as of tonight.
I no longer have a job either.

545
00:37:20.416 --> 00:37:23.041
What can I do
I couldn't do it. It didn't work out.

546
00:37:23.708 --> 00:37:26.625
What were you even trying to achieve?
Getting rich and famous?

547
00:37:27.125 --> 00:37:30.416
I don't know. You go into a restaurant.
and there's that one best table.

548
00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.458
I never got a chance to sit at that table.

549
00:37:32.541 --> 00:37:34.041
Not even once.

550
00:37:36.041 --> 00:37:37.708
But was that your actual goal in the end?

551
00:37:37.791 --> 00:37:39.916
What's the real purpose of life anyway?

552
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.791
Because you have the rich. for instance.

553
00:37:41.875 --> 00:37:44.041
And then the celebrities and the elites.

554
00:37:44.125 --> 00:37:45.958
They get to watch the show
from the box. Us?

555
00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:51.916
What's so good about that box. huh?

556
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.125
They have drinks in ice buckets
and nachos with cheese.

557
00:37:54.875 --> 00:37:57.916
They have the best seats. I'm telling you.
They have it all. man.

558
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.916
All jokes aside. I don't know…
Remember the yoga ceremony thing?

559
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.708
-Hm.
-That woman there…

560
00:38:03.791 --> 00:38:05.291
-She said that stuff about--
-Woman?

561
00:38:05.875 --> 00:38:07.916
-Wasn't it a woman?
-Yeah. it was.

562
00:38:09.041 --> 00:38:12.083
-Never mind. Go on.
-She said stuff about effort. didn't she?

563
00:38:12.166 --> 00:38:14.666
She made me start to think
about something for the first time.

564
00:38:15.208 --> 00:38:16.166
Yeah. I don't know.

565
00:38:21.375 --> 00:38:22.750
I'm pretty hungry. I think.

566
00:38:23.833 --> 00:38:26.916
Let's go get sandwiches.
There's a really famous place around here.

567
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.791
-Is it because I talk too much?
-No. What are you talking about?

568
00:38:29.875 --> 00:38:30.875
Let's go.

569
00:38:33.583 --> 00:38:35.083
-Are we going?
-Yeah. come on.

570
00:38:35.708 --> 00:38:36.541
Here. Take this.

571
00:38:38.833 --> 00:38:40.125
You guys just go ahead.

572
00:38:43.708 --> 00:38:44.708
All right. then.

573
00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:46.333
Hey.

574
00:38:49.416 --> 00:38:52.208
-You good?
-Oh God. I'm a little drunk.

575
00:38:56.375 --> 00:38:58.500
-I can't leave you alone for one second.
-Wait a minute.

576
00:38:58.583 --> 00:38:59.541
-Unbelievable.
-Okay.

577
00:38:59.625 --> 00:39:00.875
Why did you let her fall?

578
00:39:00.958 --> 00:39:02.875
-I trusted her with you.
-I'm fine.

579
00:39:03.375 --> 00:39:05.375
You let her fall. Careful.

580
00:39:18.958 --> 00:39:20.875
<i>We're playing in Köyceğiz</i>
<i>tomorrow. right?</i>

581
00:39:20.958 --> 00:39:23.166
<i>Yeah. then Fethiye. Göcek.</i>
<i>Ortaca. Every day.</i>

582
00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:26.041
What should we do?
Sleep and then go or just go now?

583
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.541
-Let's just go. It's only an hour away.
-Okay.

584
00:39:30.541 --> 00:39:31.875
What are you going to do?

585
00:39:32.666 --> 00:39:33.625
Nothing.

586
00:39:33.708 --> 00:39:35.875
For maybe the first time in my life.
I don't

587
00:39:36.375 --> 00:39:38.083
really have a plan. No purpose.

588
00:39:38.166 --> 00:39:40.583
That's great!
So for the first time. you're free.

589
00:39:40.666 --> 00:39:41.833
Yeah.

590
00:39:41.916 --> 00:39:44.166
Free to get my stuff seized
to pay my debts.

591
00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:45.500
To hell with it.

592
00:39:45.583 --> 00:39:47.875
Nothing we own belongs to us anyway.

593
00:39:48.833 --> 00:39:50.416
My dad has a saying.

594
00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:53.458
"Property isn't what you enjoy.
It's what you pay for."

595
00:39:53.541 --> 00:39:55.208
I remember he would always say that

596
00:39:55.291 --> 00:39:57.083
back when he used to be right.

597
00:39:59.041 --> 00:40:02.000
Since you have nothing to do.
why don't you come with us?

598
00:40:02.083 --> 00:40:04.041
Oh. you should! Uh-huh.

599
00:40:04.125 --> 00:40:05.208
Yeah. come with us.

600
00:40:05.291 --> 00:40:07.500
Then you can go back
to Dalaman if you want.

601
00:40:07.583 --> 00:40:10.750
Yeah. And if you come.
we might even let you play <i>darbuka.</i>

602
00:40:10.833 --> 00:40:11.708
<i>Darbuka?</i>

603
00:40:11.791 --> 00:40:12.625
Yeah.

604
00:40:12.708 --> 00:40:15.083
When he… You don't know.
He wanted to play it as a kid.

605
00:40:15.166 --> 00:40:16.875
-Oh. really?
-Stop. No.

606
00:40:18.083 --> 00:40:19.916
-I mean. listen. I did.
-Oh. come on.

607
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.666
Come on. This way.
we can have a percussion instrument.

608
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:24.625
What do you say. Yusuf?

609
00:40:24.708 --> 00:40:25.666
We'll see.

610
00:40:29.083 --> 00:40:31.000
<i>Where are you?</i>
<i>Why aren't you picking up?</i>

611
00:40:31.083 --> 00:40:33.083
Sorry. I had too much to drink last night.

612
00:40:33.791 --> 00:40:34.750
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

613
00:40:36.291 --> 00:40:39.541
Listen. Irfan. I can't do it.
This job isn't meant for me.

614
00:40:40.041 --> 00:40:42.416
I'm really grateful for
everything you did. but I'm leaving.

615
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.708
I tried. You win. I guess.

616
00:40:44.791 --> 00:40:46.166
I'll see you back in Istanbul.

617
00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:48.125
Do you have any money on you?

618
00:40:48.208 --> 00:40:50.666
I mean. I have a credit card
fighting for its life.

619
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:53.625
Okay. I'll send you some.
We can pretend you worked.

620
00:40:54.875 --> 00:40:56.000
Thank you so much. seriously.

621
00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:57.958
All right. Talk later.

622
00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:17.333
My purse!

623
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:26.291
No. because… She's just singing up there.

624
00:43:26.375 --> 00:43:28.416
-Yeah. but…
-The guy was handing her roses.

625
00:43:30.208 --> 00:43:31.416
What was I supposed to do?

626
00:43:34.333 --> 00:43:35.958
You really dived in there.

627
00:43:36.041 --> 00:43:38.291
Why did you…
Why didn't you just let it slide?

628
00:43:39.791 --> 00:43:41.333
Anyway. that was hilarious.

629
00:43:41.416 --> 00:43:42.750
Are we almost there yet?

630
00:43:42.833 --> 00:43:44.125
Here we are.

631
00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:54.500
Get out. Come on.

632
00:43:59.458 --> 00:44:00.375
Masum!

633
00:44:00.875 --> 00:44:02.000
My love!

634
00:44:02.083 --> 00:44:03.500
Come here. baby.

635
00:44:03.583 --> 00:44:05.500
Come here. Oh…

636
00:44:06.083 --> 00:44:08.625
Come here. love. Look who this is. Masum.

637
00:44:08.708 --> 00:44:10.541
This is Fırat. Get acquainted.

638
00:44:10.625 --> 00:44:11.833
Hello. Mr. Masum.

639
00:44:11.916 --> 00:44:13.000
It's a she.

640
00:44:13.083 --> 00:44:14.583
Miss. Miss Masum.

641
00:44:57.958 --> 00:44:58.833
Can I help you?

642
00:45:00.208 --> 00:45:02.750
-Is Banu in there?
-I'm sorry. who?

643
00:45:02.833 --> 00:45:04.166
Banu.

644
00:45:05.041 --> 00:45:07.458
You have the wrong house.
There's no Banu in here.

645
00:45:11.791 --> 00:45:12.666
So who are you?

646
00:45:13.666 --> 00:45:16.083
I should ask you the same question.
Who are you?

647
00:45:16.166 --> 00:45:17.083
Who is it?

648
00:45:38.041 --> 00:45:39.166
What's your name now?

649
00:45:40.458 --> 00:45:42.583
-Lidya.
-Lidya?

650
00:45:42.666 --> 00:45:43.583
Mm-hmm.

651
00:45:44.625 --> 00:45:46.625
Did you give yourself a foreign name?

652
00:45:47.791 --> 00:45:49.250
It's not really foreign.

653
00:45:53.083 --> 00:45:57.041
Well. all right. I guess that means
you changed my late mother's name too.

654
00:45:57.125 --> 00:45:59.208
No. I didn't change anyone else's name.

655
00:46:00.125 --> 00:46:01.708
I only cared about changing my own name.

656
00:46:01.791 --> 00:46:03.208
And her name is still Banu.

657
00:46:08.083 --> 00:46:08.958
Tell me…

658
00:46:09.625 --> 00:46:13.000
Do you actually live in this dump
with these two random men. Banu?

659
00:46:13.833 --> 00:46:14.666
Yes. I do.

660
00:46:15.166 --> 00:46:17.166
I do because both of them
are my friends. Dad.

661
00:46:19.583 --> 00:46:22.125
So do you really enjoy
just tormenting all of us?

662
00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:25.333
You don't care about your mother at all?

663
00:46:25.958 --> 00:46:29.333
All the embarrassment we endure
every time your relatives ask about you.

664
00:46:29.416 --> 00:46:30.958
Every single lie we have to tell.

665
00:46:31.041 --> 00:46:32.583
What did we do to you?

666
00:46:32.666 --> 00:46:35.083
Did we beat you? Swear at you? Starve you?

667
00:46:35.791 --> 00:46:37.333
Why are you doing this to us?

668
00:46:39.291 --> 00:46:41.583
But I'm not doing anything to you. Dad.

669
00:46:42.541 --> 00:46:44.000
I just want to go my own way.

670
00:46:44.083 --> 00:46:45.958
but you don't care
to understand me at all.

671
00:46:46.041 --> 00:46:48.083
You're right. I don't understand.

672
00:46:48.166 --> 00:46:50.750
I don't understand what my daughter
is doing in this shithole

673
00:46:50.833 --> 00:46:52.750
with these two good-for-nothing men.

674
00:46:52.833 --> 00:46:55.791
So tell me. sweetie. because
I really don't understand any of it.

675
00:46:55.875 --> 00:46:59.125
Well. look at how you're acting right now.
Why are you insulting my friends?

676
00:46:59.208 --> 00:47:02.666
Banu. look. I'm trying to be
as calm as humanly possible right now.

677
00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:04.125
And you can't even manage it.

678
00:47:04.208 --> 00:47:05.375
Don't provoke me!

679
00:47:09.791 --> 00:47:10.791
Masum.

680
00:47:11.291 --> 00:47:12.208
Masum. come here.

681
00:47:13.791 --> 00:47:14.666
Come here.

682
00:47:15.166 --> 00:47:16.375
Let me introduce you.

683
00:47:17.125 --> 00:47:19.291
This is my father. Behçet. This is Masum.

684
00:47:20.041 --> 00:47:22.916
He doesn't like dogs very much.
Don't take it personally.

685
00:47:25.166 --> 00:47:26.833
-Sweetie.
-Listen. Banu.

686
00:47:27.583 --> 00:47:29.625
You brought me all the way out here.

687
00:47:33.125 --> 00:47:34.166
Want some tea?

688
00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:36.416
No. No. thank you.

689
00:47:39.625 --> 00:47:42.208
You know what? I'll have some.

690
00:47:45.208 --> 00:47:47.250
Thank you so much. Yusuf.

691
00:47:47.333 --> 00:47:50.375
Thank you.
You really are the kindest person I know.

692
00:47:52.125 --> 00:47:53.166
Would you like coffee?

693
00:47:53.791 --> 00:47:55.833
-Turkish coffee?
-Fine. I'll have the tea.

694
00:47:55.916 --> 00:47:56.791
Here.

695
00:48:07.333 --> 00:48:08.916
You've really upset us.

696
00:48:10.125 --> 00:48:11.208
You've hurt us.

697
00:48:11.875 --> 00:48:15.125
And you can fix it. but only if
you're willing to put in the work.

698
00:48:17.041 --> 00:48:17.958
How's that going to go?

699
00:48:18.041 --> 00:48:20.625
All this Lidya nonsense needs to stop.

700
00:48:22.416 --> 00:48:24.583
You're going to pack your bags
and get in the car.

701
00:48:24.666 --> 00:48:26.833
and then we're going
to drive home together.

702
00:48:27.458 --> 00:48:30.125
You're going to go back
to architecture again.

703
00:48:30.708 --> 00:48:33.500
And you're going to be
our sweet little Banu again.

704
00:48:33.583 --> 00:48:35.708
Just like you were a few years ago.

705
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.750
Will you please get in the car now?

706
00:48:57.416 --> 00:48:58.333
But. Dad. listen.

707
00:49:00.083 --> 00:49:04.041
I have never felt as happy and relieved
as I have ever since I left home.

708
00:49:06.291 --> 00:49:07.875
Because I really didn't…

709
00:49:09.416 --> 00:49:12.583
do anything to disappoint you
or to disappoint myself.

710
00:49:20.333 --> 00:49:21.750
Maybe someday perhaps…

711
00:49:22.708 --> 00:49:24.708
Lidya will be who you accept because…

712
00:49:27.416 --> 00:49:29.500
I've bid Banu farewell for good and…

713
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.666
I think that you should too.

714
00:49:42.083 --> 00:49:43.125
In that case.

715
00:49:44.666 --> 00:49:46.000
then you should know that…

716
00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:50.000
you will have no family left.

717
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.333
And you are not

718
00:49:54.083 --> 00:49:55.791
our daughter anymore.

719
00:49:58.208 --> 00:49:59.041
Lidya.

720
00:50:33.791 --> 00:50:36.708
For once. I wish you could leave
without breaking anything.

721
00:52:35.083 --> 00:52:37.083
MARINE TURTLE RESEARCH & RESCUE CENTER

722
00:52:41.166 --> 00:52:42.625
WELCOME

723
00:52:43.875 --> 00:52:45.875
<i>We met before. She's amazing.</i>

724
00:52:46.583 --> 00:52:49.000
-<i>Who?</i>
-<i>Captain June.</i>

725
00:52:49.833 --> 00:52:53.458
<i>The woman who first discovered</i>
<i>the </i>Caretta carettas <i>and then saved them.</i>

726
00:52:53.541 --> 00:52:56.250
She's the daughter of an English family.

727
00:52:56.333 --> 00:52:57.708
and basically. 35 years ago.

728
00:52:57.791 --> 00:53:01.625
she left everything behind
and jumped on a tiny boat and came here.

729
00:53:01.708 --> 00:53:04.500
In fact.
she lived on three different continents

730
00:53:04.583 --> 00:53:05.750
before settling in this place.

731
00:53:05.833 --> 00:53:07.250
But this was her last stop.

732
00:53:07.333 --> 00:53:10.291
and she lives here permanently now
after traveling the whole world.

733
00:53:12.250 --> 00:53:13.458
Isn't that great?

734
00:53:13.541 --> 00:53:18.208
People that can't show that courage
shouldn't be allowed to say they're alive.

735
00:53:20.208 --> 00:53:22.125
Good thing her dad didn't track her down.

736
00:53:22.208 --> 00:53:23.166
Yusuf. come on.

737
00:53:23.875 --> 00:53:25.375
If she was one of us. they'd probably

738
00:53:25.458 --> 00:53:27.791
ask her. "What the hell
are you doing with sea turtles?"

739
00:53:27.875 --> 00:53:30.708
They're not turtles though.
They're <i>Caretta carettas.</i> old man.

740
00:53:32.375 --> 00:53:35.083
Why is it double? Why not just "karate"?

741
00:53:35.166 --> 00:53:36.208
What the hell is "karate"?

742
00:53:36.291 --> 00:53:38.916
-You know what I mean. <i>Caretta.</i>
<i>-Caretta caretta.</i>

743
00:53:57.666 --> 00:53:59.416
So how did you and Lidya meet?

744
00:54:03.333 --> 00:54:04.666
Elif introduced us.

745
00:54:05.166 --> 00:54:06.125
Elif?

746
00:54:06.208 --> 00:54:07.750
She was my girlfriend.

747
00:54:09.416 --> 00:54:10.583
You guys break up then?

748
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:13.208
No. No.

749
00:54:15.541 --> 00:54:16.708
We actually lost her.

750
00:54:33.208 --> 00:54:34.875
It was when we were in Anıttepe.

751
00:54:36.208 --> 00:54:37.125
Ankara.

752
00:54:42.041 --> 00:54:43.708
We were together for seven years.

753
00:54:49.291 --> 00:54:50.791
But she suddenly got sick.

754
00:54:51.541 --> 00:54:52.750
Happened so fast.

755
00:54:57.666 --> 00:54:58.958
She wasted away.

756
00:55:02.708 --> 00:55:03.708
Just gone.

757
00:55:14.041 --> 00:55:15.875
So then I started to mourn.

758
00:55:16.666 --> 00:55:18.958
And my friends.
they all tried to console me.

759
00:55:22.333 --> 00:55:24.708
But when my mourning lasted too long.

760
00:55:24.791 --> 00:55:26.208
they left one by one.

761
00:55:32.041 --> 00:55:33.541
Just Lidya stayed.

762
00:55:34.666 --> 00:55:37.875
The two of us have been making music
since we were in school.

763
00:55:41.791 --> 00:55:43.208
Is the mourning over now?

764
00:55:47.541 --> 00:55:48.791
She's always with me.

765
00:55:52.916 --> 00:55:54.875
Every single song is for her.

766
00:56:00.458 --> 00:56:02.375
But if she leaves me for good one day…

767
00:56:04.833 --> 00:56:06.375
and if we ever do part…

768
00:56:11.166 --> 00:56:12.791
only then will the mourning end.

769
00:56:23.875 --> 00:56:26.041
You don't think
I should let go of the dead?

770
00:56:37.250 --> 00:56:38.875
It doesn't feel that way for me.

771
00:56:40.083 --> 00:56:41.375
I live with the dead.

772
00:56:58.291 --> 00:56:59.500
How do you feel about Lidya?

773
00:57:00.916 --> 00:57:03.416
-What do you…
-How do you feel about Lidya?

774
00:57:05.958 --> 00:57:08.916
-What do you mean?
-Don't give me that crap. Come on. now.

775
00:57:24.458 --> 00:57:27.166
I mean. her feelings are more important.

776
00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:31.083
Maybe we should just ask her?

777
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.541
-Aren't you guys cold?
-We are.

778
00:57:36.625 --> 00:57:38.333
We really are. Oh.

779
00:57:39.666 --> 00:57:40.625
Here.

780
00:57:40.708 --> 00:57:43.083
She's so sweet.
See how she put it over me?

781
00:57:43.166 --> 00:57:45.583
-All right. Here.
-Thank you so much.

782
00:57:45.666 --> 00:57:47.041
-Here.
-Thank you so much.

783
00:57:47.125 --> 00:57:48.416
Here. Okay.

784
00:57:53.458 --> 00:57:56.750
In my opinion. the best song
he ever wrote for Elif is called

785
00:57:56.833 --> 00:57:58.291
"Living Without You."

786
00:58:01.833 --> 00:58:02.791
You should play it.

787
00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:08.083
Masum.

788
00:58:08.166 --> 00:58:09.083
Come here.

789
00:58:57.541 --> 00:59:00.250
There's someone out there watching us
like this too. right?

790
00:59:01.125 --> 00:59:03.125
-From the sky. you mean?
-Yeah.

791
00:59:03.833 --> 00:59:04.750
I think there is.

792
00:59:04.833 --> 00:59:07.666
They're probably asking the same.
"I wonder if there's life down there."

793
00:59:09.583 --> 00:59:10.750
There isn't. guys.

794
00:59:11.250 --> 00:59:13.875
I mean. there's life here.
but it's a real struggle.

795
00:59:14.958 --> 00:59:16.500
It's just garbage down here.

796
00:59:17.125 --> 00:59:19.541
I hope you guys are a little freer
where you are.

797
00:59:23.166 --> 00:59:24.250
Is something wrong?

798
00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:28.458
I'm now totally free. as you call it.

799
00:59:29.166 --> 00:59:32.500
The bailiffs just came and basically took
whatever was left in my house.

800
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:34.416
Are you upset about it?

801
00:59:36.666 --> 00:59:38.916
I don't know.
I think I don't feel much anymore.

802
00:59:39.541 --> 00:59:41.041
Yeah. right. You're a little upset.

803
00:59:41.125 --> 00:59:44.208
Yeah. I'm a little upset. I put a lot
of effort into furnishing that house.

804
00:59:45.250 --> 00:59:46.666
Fırat. effort again…

805
00:59:48.625 --> 00:59:50.166
Yes. again.

806
00:59:55.583 --> 00:59:56.583
Hey. Lidya.

807
00:59:56.666 --> 00:59:57.583
Hmm?

808
01:00:05.541 --> 01:00:07.625
Have you ever fallen in love?

809
01:00:10.208 --> 01:00:11.041
Don't really know.

810
01:00:13.708 --> 01:00:15.958
How do you even know
when you're really in love?

811
01:00:16.458 --> 01:00:18.125
I'm getting butterflies in my stomach.

812
01:00:19.125 --> 01:00:20.541
I mean. it's very strange.

813
01:00:20.625 --> 01:00:22.333
'Cause there's no pain. but it aches.

814
01:00:22.416 --> 01:00:24.708
And then your whole body
goes numb from head to toe.

815
01:00:28.166 --> 01:00:32.166
Then can we say that
love is the most dangerous drug there is?

816
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.833
We can. And being without it
is probably horrible too.

817
01:00:39.291 --> 01:00:41.250
You know how we keep talking about effort?

818
01:00:41.333 --> 01:00:42.375
Mm-hmm.

819
01:00:42.458 --> 01:00:45.125
Would it also be pointless
to make an effort for love?

820
01:00:51.666 --> 01:00:53.250
I think there's absolutely no point

821
01:00:53.333 --> 01:00:55.916
in making an effort when it comes to
relationships and love.

822
01:00:57.875 --> 01:00:59.208
I think love

823
01:00:59.291 --> 01:01:01.166
should be experienced in the moment.

824
01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:03.083
should be wild and spontaneous.

825
01:01:06.958 --> 01:01:09.750
Do you think a relationship
where one person

826
01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:11.500
puts in all the effort is love?

827
01:01:15.125 --> 01:01:16.041
Well. no. I guess.

828
01:01:20.791 --> 01:01:22.666
-A shooting star!
-It is!

829
01:01:24.916 --> 01:01:26.291
Have to make a wish. Come on.

830
01:01:27.291 --> 01:01:28.833
Do any of your wishes ever come true?

831
01:01:29.791 --> 01:01:31.875
I don't know. I never kept track of them.

832
01:01:32.541 --> 01:01:34.166
But make a wish anyway. Come on.

833
01:01:38.083 --> 01:01:38.916
I did.

834
01:01:42.416 --> 01:01:43.458
And I did too.

835
01:02:04.708 --> 01:02:06.750
-Yusuf. stop. Stop!
-What's wrong?

836
01:02:06.833 --> 01:02:08.458
-Stop. Stop. Back up!
-Why?

837
01:02:08.541 --> 01:02:10.041
Just back up. I saw something.

838
01:02:10.541 --> 01:02:12.375
-What did you see?
-Isn't that…

839
01:02:12.458 --> 01:02:14.666
Back up. man. Come on. Back up.

840
01:02:15.541 --> 01:02:18.916
-Isn't that the sign the yogi showed us?
-Yoga! It is!

841
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.750
-Isn't that the sign?
-Oh. right.

842
01:02:22.875 --> 01:02:23.708
What should we do?

843
01:02:24.291 --> 01:02:25.291
Uh…

844
01:02:26.416 --> 01:02:28.583
-You think we should go?
-Yeah. let's go.

845
01:02:28.666 --> 01:02:30.208
-Come on. Come on. man.
-Go.

846
01:02:30.291 --> 01:02:31.375
Yeah. come on.

847
01:02:43.041 --> 01:02:44.375
Look. There's the sign.

848
01:02:47.333 --> 01:02:49.583
But we need to go that way.

849
01:02:50.458 --> 01:02:51.708
Look to the right.

850
01:02:51.791 --> 01:02:53.000
Yeah. It's right.

851
01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:51.125
Excuse me. Hi.

852
01:03:53.250 --> 01:03:54.083
Shh.

853
01:04:02.958 --> 01:04:05.750
WE'RE DOING A SILENT RETREAT
TALKING IS FORBIDDEN

854
01:04:14.875 --> 01:04:17.666
EITHER LEAVE OR STOP TALKING

855
01:04:23.583 --> 01:04:26.291
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?

856
01:04:29.708 --> 01:04:30.916
SEVEN DAYS

857
01:04:48.708 --> 01:04:50.458
WE'RE STAYING

858
01:04:51.541 --> 01:04:52.625
<i> Welcome.</i>

859
01:04:52.708 --> 01:04:54.708
<i>I'm the only one who can speak here.</i>

860
01:04:54.791 --> 01:04:58.708
<i>I will explain the program of the camp</i>
<i>and the system.</i>

861
01:04:58.791 --> 01:05:01.125
<i>We wake up at 4:00 a.m. every morning.</i>

862
01:05:01.208 --> 01:05:04.708
<i>Breakfast after morning meditation</i>
<i>and no activity.</i>

863
01:05:04.791 --> 01:05:07.166
<i>We don't do any yoga or fitness.</i>

864
01:05:07.791 --> 01:05:10.375
<i>Here. you will only be by yourself.</i>

865
01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.500
So please. enjoy the silence and serenity.

866
01:05:14.250 --> 01:05:15.500
I welcome you once again.

867
01:05:18.416 --> 01:05:19.875
So wait. did you say 4:00. then?

868
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:19.916
Shh.

869
01:09:41.375 --> 01:09:43.916
All right. Now it's time to talk again.

870
01:09:47.083 --> 01:09:48.791
Don't feel like talking. do you now?

871
01:09:49.416 --> 01:09:50.458
That always happens.

872
01:09:50.958 --> 01:09:52.416
When we're silent. we can't speak.

873
01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:54.500
And when we have the freedom to speak.

874
01:09:55.208 --> 01:09:56.833
we cannot be silent.

875
01:09:56.916 --> 01:09:59.000
Anyway. we'll all know
the truth soon enough.

876
01:09:59.083 --> 01:10:00.541
I'll leave you for now. Goodbye.

877
01:10:55.583 --> 01:10:56.791
Wow. guys.

878
01:11:05.541 --> 01:11:06.375
Hey?

879
01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:09.750
-What's up?
-Hey. what?

880
01:11:09.833 --> 01:11:11.583
So what's up? You guys dating now?

881
01:11:13.083 --> 01:11:14.916
-What do you mean?
-Where did that come from?

882
01:11:15.458 --> 01:11:17.583
You were kissing on the porch at the farm.

883
01:11:23.791 --> 01:11:25.791
So then I guess you probably saw us. huh?

884
01:11:25.875 --> 01:11:28.291
Of course I did.
I just pretended not to see very clearly.

885
01:11:36.791 --> 01:11:39.791
Let's go back.
You didn't answer the original question.

886
01:11:44.375 --> 01:11:45.750
Are you--

887
01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:52.916
MUĞLA TRAFFIC ACCIDENT

888
01:12:55.333 --> 01:12:56.416
BREAKING NEWS…

889
01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:59.125
HORRIBLE ACCIDENT IN MUĞLA
YUSUF DAĞLI KILLED

890
01:13:13.833 --> 01:13:16.625
Everything's a mess.
People are dying from Covid.

891
01:13:16.708 --> 01:13:18.375
but he's fixated on leaving.

892
01:13:18.458 --> 01:13:19.958
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

893
01:13:26.208 --> 01:13:27.125
Thank you.

894
01:13:38.333 --> 01:13:39.666
I have to go and find her.

895
01:13:42.416 --> 01:13:45.625
Fırat. listen.
The world is very different these days.

896
01:13:46.333 --> 01:13:47.916
Don't you see what's on TV?

897
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.500
Thousands of people
have died so far. Fırat.

898
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.416
And it's getting worse and worse.

899
01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:54.125
Restaurants are closed.

900
01:13:54.625 --> 01:13:56.208
There's a lockdown.

901
01:13:57.958 --> 01:13:59.541
I don't know how to explain this to him.

902
01:14:01.083 --> 01:14:04.500
I wish we could all just
sleep through things like you were.

903
01:14:08.291 --> 01:14:10.541
Her dad had
a construction company in Ankara.

904
01:14:10.625 --> 01:14:12.208
I've got the address somewhere.

905
01:14:13.291 --> 01:14:14.125
We've already met.

906
01:14:14.208 --> 01:14:16.208
and I know I'm probably gonna need a car.

907
01:14:17.875 --> 01:14:19.125
I also need some money.

908
01:14:19.208 --> 01:14:21.125
but I owe you a lot
from what I can remember.

909
01:14:21.208 --> 01:14:22.875
Hey. stop being ridiculous.

910
01:14:22.958 --> 01:14:24.041
There's no debt.

911
01:14:24.875 --> 01:14:27.000
Forget about it.
You don't owe us anything.

912
01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:30.458
You don't. Just please stay healthy.

913
01:14:32.333 --> 01:14:33.208
Sure. of course.

914
01:14:33.291 --> 01:14:36.083
This is not the time to talk about debts.

915
01:14:46.041 --> 01:14:47.125
Here are the car keys.

916
01:14:49.666 --> 01:14:52.458
Take the car. but you can't come back
until you find the girl.

917
01:14:53.875 --> 01:14:54.708
You got it.

918
01:14:55.833 --> 01:14:57.083
Thank you both so much.

919
01:14:58.416 --> 01:15:00.208
-Uh. what about gas?
-We'll take care of it.

920
01:15:00.291 --> 01:15:02.416
We'll send money
to your credit card. Don't worry.

921
01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:04.625
What are we. his sponsors now?
I don't understand.

922
01:15:05.166 --> 01:15:07.666
It's for love. We're sponsoring love.

923
01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:10.291
Don't know what I'd do without you guys.

924
01:15:10.375 --> 01:15:13.666
You'd be fine.
You would've taken someone else's car.

925
01:15:15.541 --> 01:15:17.750
-Have a safe trip.
-Thank you both so much.

926
01:15:18.291 --> 01:15:19.583
Here you go. sir.

BETT ENTERPRISES

928
01:16:25.125 --> 01:16:27.708
-Hello. there. I came to see Behçet.
-Do you have an appointment?

929
01:16:28.666 --> 01:16:30.291
No. but it's really important.

930
01:16:30.375 --> 01:16:32.000
Then make an appointment. sir.

931
01:16:32.083 --> 01:16:33.708
I'm his driver. What's this about?

932
01:16:33.791 --> 01:16:37.000
Hello. I have to see Behçet immediately.
It's very important.

933
01:16:37.083 --> 01:16:38.625
It's about his daughter. Lidya. Or Banu.

934
01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:42.916
I was in that car too.

935
01:16:45.791 --> 01:16:46.791
Follow me.

936
01:16:51.041 --> 01:16:54.000
<i> If she had listened to me</i>
<i>that day and got in the car.</i>

937
01:16:54.083 --> 01:16:55.958
<i>none of this would've ever happened.</i>

938
01:16:59.625 --> 01:17:01.166
Where's she now? Is she all right?

939
01:17:05.458 --> 01:17:07.291
So tell me. what do you really want?

940
01:17:08.583 --> 01:17:11.041
I just want to see her.
just one more time.

941
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.333
What did you say your name was?

942
01:17:14.916 --> 01:17:16.666
-Fırat.
-Fırat. listen.

943
01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:21.208
I suggest you get out of this room now.
Just forget about my daughter.

944
01:17:22.208 --> 01:17:24.083
This is the last time I'll be seeing you.

945
01:17:25.125 --> 01:17:27.000
And I won't be as kind as I am now

946
01:17:27.083 --> 01:17:28.458
if I ever see you again.

947
01:17:28.958 --> 01:17:30.708
I can't let you remind my daughter

948
01:17:30.791 --> 01:17:33.041
about the crazy life we did our best
to make her forget.

949
01:17:33.125 --> 01:17:36.375
But I don't have any bad intentions.
I wanna see her just this once.

950
01:17:41.791 --> 01:17:43.708
It's time for you to go. sir.

951
01:17:50.958 --> 01:17:53.750
I mean no disrespect.
but I really need to say this because

952
01:17:53.833 --> 01:17:56.083
you're the one
who hurt your daughter the most.

953
01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:57.916
Please get him out of here.

954
01:17:58.458 --> 01:17:59.666
Come on. let's go.

955
01:17:59.750 --> 01:18:00.750
-Let go of me.
-Sir--

956
01:18:00.833 --> 01:18:01.791
Let go of me!

957
01:21:56.291 --> 01:21:58.208
I'm just going to get some fresh air.

958
01:22:19.125 --> 01:22:21.625
I was in a coma for such a long time.
That's why I couldn't--

959
01:22:21.708 --> 01:22:22.541
I know.

960
01:22:24.125 --> 01:22:25.083
I know that.

961
01:22:26.458 --> 01:22:29.458
I called. I called so much.
I think I made your mom mad.

962
01:22:29.958 --> 01:22:31.791
But she didn't say anything to me.

963
01:22:35.208 --> 01:22:37.000
She was blaming me for everything.

964
01:22:41.125 --> 01:22:42.333
Well. your father was…

965
01:22:43.833 --> 01:22:46.875
How should I put this… Not very welcoming.

966
01:22:48.333 --> 01:22:49.458
I can imagine.

967
01:22:55.041 --> 01:22:57.041
Anyway. they told me
I would never walk again.

968
01:22:57.541 --> 01:22:59.541
but I didn't like that idea very much.

969
01:23:00.458 --> 01:23:02.041
And now. look at me.

970
01:23:12.208 --> 01:23:13.125
Uh…

971
01:23:16.916 --> 01:23:17.833
Yusuf…

972
01:23:21.708 --> 01:23:22.625
Yusuf…

973
01:23:45.250 --> 01:23:47.375
I've left the two of you alone
long enough.

974
01:23:47.458 --> 01:23:49.166
You've had your chat.

975
01:23:49.250 --> 01:23:52.625
I think it would be best to say goodbye
to each other in a civilized manner.

976
01:23:55.333 --> 01:23:56.291
Look. son.

977
01:23:56.375 --> 01:23:58.625
We're just starting
to get ourselves back together.

978
01:23:58.708 --> 01:24:00.875
Thank God
our daughter's back in the family.

979
01:24:00.958 --> 01:24:02.583
Let's not ruin what we have here.

980
01:24:03.083 --> 01:24:06.583
-As soon as I feel better. Mom. I'm--
-You're not going anywhere.

981

You're not going anywhere anymore.

982
01:24:13.416 --> 01:24:15.583
-Hey. what are you doing?
-It's okay. Nezir.

983
01:24:17.833 --> 01:24:18.750
Sweetie. come on.

984
01:24:26.083 --> 01:24:27.083
Okay. Mom.

985
01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:29.833
Goodbye.

986
01:24:37.416 --> 01:24:38.750
Don't let this end here.

-Lidya.
-Fırat.

988
01:25:54.958 --> 01:25:56.458
