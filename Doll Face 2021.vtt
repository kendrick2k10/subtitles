3
00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:07.163
- Very sensitive.

4
00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:08.039
- Yes.

5
00:04:27.308 --> 00:04:28.601
- Miss Marmalade.

6
00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:31.604
First of all. I'd like
to reintroduce ourselves.

7
00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:35.149
My name is Mr. Bartholomew.
and this is Mr. Toboggan

8
00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:36.192
and we're of the law firm

9
00:04:36.192 --> 00:04:38.236
of Toboggan. Toboggan. and Toboggan.

10
00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:40.613
Your grandmother was a very.

11
00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:42.615
very important client of the firm.

12
00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:44.534
Isn't that right. Mr. Toboggan?

13
00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:47.078
We're here because she has willed you

14
00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:49.205
this condo in its entirety.

15
00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:53.418
Every little thing that you
see paid for is now yours

16
00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:57.046
for your entire lifetime until
God forbid you should die

17
00:04:57.046 --> 00:05:00.300
or I should say pass
away of natural causes.

18
00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:03.469
All you've got to do is sign the contract.

19
00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:05.430
Should we show her the
agreement. Mr. Toboggan?

20
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.223
Please. please.

21
00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:09.225
Right here. right here.

22
00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:17.442
Mr. Toboggan. would you please
place the contract down?

23
00:05:19.068 --> 00:05:21.112
If you would be just so
kind to sign the contract

24
00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:23.531
and don't read any of the small detail.

25
00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:26.075
Mr. Toboggan is an expert
in this I promise you

26
00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:27.160
and he's a notary.

27
00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:28.619
He will witness your signature.

28
00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:30.621
Whoa. whoa. one second.

29
00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:31.873
Don't sign the contract just yet.

30
00:05:32.206 --> 00:05:33.041
I forgot to tell her

31
00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:36.044
about the supplemental
part of the contract.

32
00:05:36.085 --> 00:05:37.587
- Don't look at them in the eye.

33
00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:41.257
- Your grandmother was very.
very emphatic about one thing.

34
00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:43.301
And I'd like to take you on this adventure

35
00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:45.261
about your grandmother
that maybe you didn't know

36
00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:46.429
or maybe you did know.

37
00:05:46.929 --> 00:05:51.934
From every country from
Armenia to India to Sri Lanka

38
00:05:52.268 --> 00:05:54.645
and she loved these dolls.

39
00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:56.314
I mean. look at the beauty of these dolls.

40
00:05:56.314 --> 00:05:57.523
The faces.

41
00:05:57.523 --> 00:06:00.568
She loved them like they
were her own children.

42
00:06:00.568 --> 00:06:03.488
And there's a stipulation
now in the agreement

43
00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:05.907
that you must look after these dolls

44
00:06:05.948 --> 00:06:08.117
as though they were your own.

45
00:06:08.117 --> 00:06:10.536
Mr. Toboggan. would you
please come sit down?

46
00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:12.163
It is not only a contractual.

47
00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:14.248
but it's a spiritual obligation.

48
00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:16.376
And if anything was to happen.

49
00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:18.961
you must get in touch with
the master doll maker.

50
00:06:18.961 --> 00:06:20.088
The card. please.

51
00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:22.048
He's available 24 seven.

52
00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:24.425
You must get in contact immediately

53
00:06:24.425 --> 00:06:27.220
if anything was to happen and
I mean anything whatsoever.

54
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.054
Please take that.

55
00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:30.515
It's an emergency
telephone number 24 seven.

56
00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:34.727
You call this number and
let me explain to you why.

57
00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:35.770
You see the dolls?

58
00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:38.731
You see how lifelike the dolls are?

59
00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:40.191
They look real.

60
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:43.111
They are so perfect.

61
00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:44.028
Every little.

62
00:06:44.028 --> 00:06:45.571
Look at the nose.

63
00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:47.448
Oh. you cute little doll.

64
00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:49.200
What about the lips?

65
00:06:52.995 --> 00:06:53.830
Right?

66
00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:56.040
Do you love these dolls the way

67
00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.292
your grandmother loved these dolls?

68
00:06:58.292 --> 00:06:59.544
That's important.

69
00:06:59.544 --> 00:07:01.796
If you can love the dolls the way

70
00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:03.756
your grandmother loved the dolls.

71
00:07:03.756 --> 00:07:06.426
Mr. Toboggan and I are prepared

72
00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:08.678
to watch you sign that contract

73
00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:13.015
and all of this and every
doll in it is yours.

74
00:07:13.015 --> 00:07:15.351
- Just don't look at them in the eyes.

75
00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:16.602
- Are you ready for that?

76
00:07:17.812 --> 00:07:18.896
Sign the contract.

77
00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:26.237
Can we give her the keys now?

78
00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:32.368
The key is now yours.

79
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:37.165
- Congratulations.

80
00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:39.417
- And with that said. I
think we better get going.

81
00:07:39.417 --> 00:07:42.003
It was great meeting you. Miss Marmalade.

82
00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:44.172
We're gonna leave this with you.

83
00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:45.548
I know you're gonna be very happy

84
00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:46.841
and you'll never be lonely.

85
00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:47.800
We should get going.

86
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.718
- Congratulations.

87
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.680
- Just call the doll maker.

88
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.764
- Careful. they bite.

89
00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:57.018
- What are you saying
something like that for?

90
00:07:57.018 --> 00:07:58.728
I mean. that's stupid.

91
00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:32.637
You behave yourself

92
00:08:32.637 --> 00:08:34.222
and we'll get along just fine.

93
00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:40.640
It shall take forever

94
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.099
for me to name you all.

95
00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:45.227
Longer for me to remember.

96
00:10:48.147 --> 00:10:49.482
Let's see.

97
00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.025
Who will sleep with me tonight?

98
00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:58.908
I'm still a virgin. which
means no funny business

99
00:10:59.075 --> 00:11:00.409
and tell no one.

100
00:11:00.409 --> 00:11:01.410
You hear me?

101
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:04.455
All I need to be is a
laughingstock of my peers.

102
00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:09.877
There. sweet face.

103
00:11:12.046 --> 00:11:13.756
My name is Adeline.

104
00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:16.133
I don't know the new language very well

105
00:11:16.133 --> 00:11:17.968
and I don't have any friends.

106
00:11:18.427 --> 00:11:20.304
I feel that I have never fit in

107
00:11:20.304 --> 00:11:22.264
with the people of this new world.

108
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.018
but my dad says soon it
will be better than home.

109
00:11:26.018 --> 00:11:27.019
We are free here.

110
00:11:34.985 --> 00:11:37.154
Now don't be jealous.

111
00:11:37.655 --> 00:11:39.907
That's not an attribute to be proud of.

112
00:11:41.575 --> 00:11:44.203
We have tomorrow night
and the rest of my life

113
00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:47.540
till I pass away peacefully
by natural causes.

114
00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:50.042
Goodnight.

115
00:12:35.671 --> 00:12:37.465
I'm so sorry. Adeline.

116
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.925
I cry myself to sleep every night

117
00:12:40.009 --> 00:12:41.385
since I merely turned girl.

118
00:12:42.678 --> 00:12:44.013
God only knows why.

119
00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:20.758
- This file is on a slingshot.

120
00:13:26.388 --> 00:13:29.850
Ae you going to introduce me?

121
00:13:30.351 --> 00:13:31.185
Kenneth doesn't

122
00:13:31.185 --> 00:13:33.562
appreciate your sarcasm. Dr. Feverheart.

123
00:13:34.104 --> 00:13:35.564
Even though it just a doll.

124
00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:38.651
- I can see that.

125
00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:41.695
What?

126
00:13:41.695 --> 00:13:44.740
That he doesn't like your
sarcasm or that he's just a doll?

127
00:13:45.324 --> 00:13:47.576
- How have you been feeling. Marmalade?

128
00:13:48.953 --> 00:13:49.912
Same.

129
00:13:51.205 --> 00:13:52.706
- And last night?

130
00:13:54.041 --> 00:13:58.754
Have you given any more thought
to the idea of medication?

131
00:13:58.754 --> 00:13:59.547
No.

132
00:14:00.798 --> 00:14:04.593
- You do realize you are
biting the nails of Kenneth.

133
00:14:04.635 --> 00:14:06.095
Sorry.

134
00:14:06.178 --> 00:14:08.764
You seem to care more about
Kenneth than you do me.

135
00:14:14.061 --> 00:14:21.360
- Subliminal hunger
manifested in nail biting.

136
00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:23.988
That's not true.

137
00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:26.740
Hey. he's only made of clay.

138
00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:29.493
You are a living being.

139
00:14:31.161 --> 00:14:33.414
Well. you
could have fooled me.

140
00:14:34.623 --> 00:14:37.751
- Perhaps I should make out
the medication to Kenneth.

141
00:14:39.044 --> 00:14:40.212
Not funny.

142
00:14:51.682 --> 00:14:53.100
How time flies.

143
00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.895
- Well you wanted our session
time to be cut in half.

144
00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:56.770
Well. yes.

145
00:14:56.937 --> 00:14:58.814
I want to win myself.

146
00:14:58.814 --> 00:15:02.943
- In case you or Kenneth
change your minds.

147
00:15:04.778 --> 00:15:06.739
You may
need a doc more than me.

148
00:15:06.947 --> 00:15:08.616
- I'll see you next week at two.

149
00:15:10.868 --> 00:15:12.119
2:17.

150
00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:13.579
She can wait.

151
00:15:21.503 --> 00:15:22.755
Can you imagine that?

152
00:15:23.255 --> 00:15:26.800
Bad enough doc is
offering me drugs but you?

153
00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.434
Oops.

154
00:15:46.362 --> 00:15:49.448
If grandmother saw
that. I'd lose a candle.

155
00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:12.012
Don't you dare.

156
00:16:12.012 --> 00:16:13.764
We can fall out the window.

157
00:17:30.257 --> 00:17:32.217
You hear that. Cosmo?

158
00:19:32.713 --> 00:19:33.797
An electrical outage

159
00:19:33.797 --> 00:19:35.632
has just struck the metropolitan area

160
00:19:35.632 --> 00:19:37.467
with a 100.000 left in the dark.

161
00:19:39.219 --> 00:19:40.929
Spokeswoman for water and power

162
00:19:40.929 --> 00:19:43.348
is blaming a main power
generator that went out.

163
00:19:44.349 --> 00:19:46.602
If not
one thing. it's another.

164
00:20:17.382 --> 00:20:18.634
Nothing to fear.

165
00:20:18.634 --> 00:20:20.260
Only an electrical outage.

166
00:20:23.305 --> 00:20:26.308
I wonder who will sleep with me tonight?

167
00:20:57.839 --> 00:21:00.634
Esmee of Holland. land of windmills.

168
00:21:00.634 --> 00:21:01.343
Nice to meet you.

169
00:21:10.602 --> 00:21:13.063
How gallant and striking you must look

170
00:21:13.063 --> 00:21:15.565
with your beautiful wheat colored hair

171
00:21:15.565 --> 00:21:17.526
blowing in the wayward winds.

172
00:21:19.653 --> 00:21:21.071
Those wayward winds.

173
00:22:32.267 --> 00:22:33.185
Bonjour. Gilbert.

174
00:22:33.894 --> 00:22:35.062
Marmalade.

175
00:22:35.562 --> 00:22:37.356
You know how many messages I left you?

176
00:22:37.356 --> 00:22:38.065
How many?

177
00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.191
10.

178
00:22:39.608 --> 00:22:40.734
Be thankful
this didn't turn out

179
00:22:40.734 --> 00:22:42.402
to be number 11.

180
00:22:42.944 --> 00:22:44.321
What do you want?

181
00:22:44.696 --> 00:22:45.989
What I always want.

182
00:22:46.573 --> 00:22:47.074
To see you.

183
00:22:49.493 --> 00:22:50.952
I'm in a phase. Gilbert.

184
00:22:51.286 --> 00:22:52.871
And maybe a little respect.

185
00:22:53.705 --> 00:22:55.415
When you
die. I'll pay my respects.

186
00:22:55.665 --> 00:22:56.958
Oh geez.

187
00:22:57.751 --> 00:22:58.752
Did you join the dark side?

188
00:22:59.086 --> 00:23:00.087
Yes. Gilbert.

189
00:23:04.883 --> 00:23:06.927
So why do you love me so much?

190
00:23:08.303 --> 00:23:09.346
That smile.

191
00:23:09.805 --> 00:23:10.764
You'll be sticking a knife in my back

192
00:23:10.764 --> 00:23:14.267
but that smile makes me think.
gosh. she didn't mean it.

193
00:23:17.771 --> 00:23:19.815
Gilbert. I
haven't smiled forever.

194
00:23:20.148 --> 00:23:21.108
Oh. I can wait.

195
00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:22.234
How sweet.

196
00:23:23.777 --> 00:23:24.653
It's Thursday.

197
00:23:24.653 --> 00:23:25.529
I can drive you.

198
00:23:26.279 --> 00:23:28.448
That wouldn't
count as conservation day.

199
00:23:28.615 --> 00:23:30.867
You'd be spilling gas
into the environment.

200
00:23:31.243 --> 00:23:33.537
I'm taking the bus like every Thursday.

201
00:23:33.787 --> 00:23:35.205
Well. I can
ride with you on the bus.

202
00:23:37.874 --> 00:23:39.042
Not today. Gilbert.

203
00:23:39.042 --> 00:23:40.210
I'm in a phase.

204
00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:41.336
We can take the bus ride

205
00:23:41.336 --> 00:23:42.879
when you're finished with your homework.

206
00:23:42.879 --> 00:23:43.547
Goodbye.

207
00:23:43.547 --> 00:23:44.548
Wait.

208
00:23:44.756 --> 00:23:45.590
Too late.

209
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:46.383
I hung up already.

210
00:23:46.383 --> 00:23:47.467
No. you didn't.

211
00:24:22.085 --> 00:24:23.336
Excuse me.

212
00:24:23.336 --> 00:24:25.589
I'm looking for this address.
but there doesn't seem

213
00:24:25.589 --> 00:24:30.135
to be a 7575 Plus One
Quarter Forgotten Street.

214
00:24:31.011 --> 00:24:32.137
- It's that Forgotten Street.

215
00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.306
In there?

216
00:24:36.433 --> 00:24:37.726
Don't like this too much.

217
00:24:53.658 --> 00:24:57.746
Cosmo. what kind of doll fixer
could reside in an alleyway?

218
00:24:58.246 --> 00:24:59.956
- The homeless kind.

219
00:25:00.248 --> 00:25:01.082
That's who.

220
00:25:04.127 --> 00:25:05.712
You dropped something there. dolly.

221
00:25:05.754 --> 00:25:06.713
Come on in here.

222
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:07.589
Come on in here.

223
00:25:07.631 --> 00:25:08.965
Come on. I'll take a look at that.

224
00:25:10.509 --> 00:25:12.385
Now Cosmo's
broken in two ways.

225
00:25:12.385 --> 00:25:13.595
- Three ways.

226
00:25:13.637 --> 00:25:15.722
You ain't accounting for his broken heart.

227
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.560
Know all the pass codes
to the neighborhood.

228
00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:21.686
Don't tell nobody.

229
00:25:21.686 --> 00:25:24.564
Now. come on inside and I'll have a look.

230
00:25:24.814 --> 00:25:25.649
Come on.

231
00:25:26.733 --> 00:25:28.443
How do you
know he has a broken heart?

232
00:25:28.443 --> 00:25:30.779
- Every doll has a broken heart.

233
00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:33.198
Don't you know they all wanna be human?

234
00:25:33.198 --> 00:25:35.116
Now. come on inside here. doll face.

235
00:25:35.575 --> 00:25:37.118
Come on. come on.

236
00:25:44.209 --> 00:25:45.794
Let me have a look.

237
00:25:47.379 --> 00:25:48.213
Let me have a.

238
00:25:48.213 --> 00:25:49.047
Let.

239
00:25:49.047 --> 00:25:50.090
Come.

240
00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:51.216
Please be careful.

241
00:25:51.216 --> 00:25:52.759
You've done enough damage.

242
00:25:53.134 --> 00:25:55.512
- There's no damage I can't fix.

243
00:26:02.978 --> 00:26:04.354
Do you like the new artwork?

244
00:26:05.021 --> 00:26:06.189
- Course I like the artwork.

245
00:26:06.189 --> 00:26:07.232
I designed it.

246
00:26:09.859 --> 00:26:11.069
You're the doll fixer?

247
00:26:11.278 --> 00:26:13.446
- What do you think we're doing
here? Meeting for my health?

248
00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:28.837
Say. I have seen worse.

249
00:26:29.963 --> 00:26:30.797
Cosmo.

250
00:26:31.798 --> 00:26:32.716
You're gonna live.

251
00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.554
Tell me what's your name. doll face?

252
00:26:37.721 --> 00:26:38.847
Marmalade.

253
00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:57.240
- Doll face. go down the block.

254
00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:58.617
Take a left.

255
00:26:58.658 --> 00:26:59.868
Hank's Cafe.

256
00:26:59.868 --> 00:27:00.869
Two lattes.

257
00:27:00.869 --> 00:27:03.038
Fixing time is one half hour.

258
00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:09.002
Shoo.

259
00:27:09.002 --> 00:27:10.629
You can't watch me while I do my magic.

260
00:27:10.837 --> 00:27:12.339
Go. go. shoo. shoo.

261
00:27:12.339 --> 00:27:13.340
Two lattes.

262
00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.091
I don't want a latte.

263
00:27:15.425 --> 00:27:19.638
- Two lattes for me. doll
face. and with soy milk.

264
00:27:19.638 --> 00:27:21.556
Got to look out for them cows.

265
00:27:21.556 --> 00:27:22.974
Now move along.

266
00:27:23.308 --> 00:27:24.976
Move along.

267
00:27:54.089 --> 00:27:56.883
Had a hard time holding
up still. but I managed.

268
00:27:57.008 --> 00:27:59.052
Two out of the three fixed.

269
00:27:59.052 --> 00:27:59.761
Okay.

270
00:28:00.637 --> 00:28:02.472
Still got that broken heart though.

271
00:28:02.472 --> 00:28:04.224
Afraid that one's out of my league.

272
00:28:06.226 --> 00:28:08.269
You never
know he was broken.

273
00:28:10.397 --> 00:28:12.857
Did you know my grandmother Estelle?

274
00:28:12.857 --> 00:28:14.359
- You look just like her.

275
00:28:14.359 --> 00:28:16.027
Both doll faces.

276
00:28:20.073 --> 00:28:21.658
Thank you so much.

277
00:28:21.658 --> 00:28:23.284
I could have lost everything.

278
00:28:23.535 --> 00:28:25.537
- And been homeless like myself.

279
00:28:25.537 --> 00:28:26.579
Don't advise that.

280
00:28:28.164 --> 00:28:29.749
How much do I owe you?

281
00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:32.252
- All in the contract.

282
00:28:33.962 --> 00:28:34.796
What contract?

283
00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:36.756
- The one I signed with your grandmother.

284
00:28:38.925 --> 00:28:42.095
Okay. does it for me.

285
00:28:42.721 --> 00:28:44.597
I'll be moseying on my way now.

286
00:28:44.597 --> 00:28:46.975
Gonna freshen my supplies.

287
00:28:47.267 --> 00:28:48.101
Nice seeing you.

288
00:28:50.353 --> 00:28:52.856
Ever hear
of a doll hanging himself?

289
00:28:54.482 --> 00:29:00.488
- Old wives tales. spooky
fairy tales and legends.

290
00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:01.573
Why?

291
00:29:02.866 --> 00:29:05.034
One of grandmother's dolls.

292
00:29:05.034 --> 00:29:06.119
- Damn.

293
00:29:06.286 --> 00:29:07.912
Spunkneck curse.

294
00:29:07.912 --> 00:29:08.621
Huh?

295
00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:13.293
- Thought it was cast
out when he hung himself.

296
00:29:13.293 --> 00:29:15.128
Who hung himself?

297
00:29:15.378 --> 00:29:18.590
- Spunkneck. the demented doll maker.

298
00:29:22.802 --> 00:29:26.181
I was doing good. but curses like this

299
00:29:26.181 --> 00:29:28.057
drop me from the wagon.

300
00:29:31.936 --> 00:29:32.520
Sorry. kid.

301
00:29:34.814 --> 00:29:36.608
I don't normally make house calls.

302
00:29:37.317 --> 00:29:39.736
If it gets any worse. you call me.

303
00:29:43.281 --> 00:29:44.324
Worse?

304
00:29:44.491 --> 00:29:46.284
Another hanging.

305
00:30:06.513 --> 00:30:07.847
Keep the faith.

306
00:30:26.616 --> 00:30:29.160
Hey. Tanechka. you look nice and warm.

307
00:30:30.578 --> 00:30:31.496
It's your turn.

308
00:31:34.517 --> 00:31:36.019
Come here.

309
00:31:37.395 --> 00:31:39.105
No.

310
00:31:39.105 --> 00:31:42.317
Come here. come here.

311
00:33:06.484 --> 00:33:08.152
Thank you for
seeing me spur of the moment.

312
00:33:08.152 --> 00:33:09.612
I was beside myself.

313
00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:11.155
- Yeah.

314
00:33:11.239 --> 00:33:13.825
There's nothing I can detect
that's out of the ordinary.

315
00:33:14.325 --> 00:33:17.996
Although I am gonna recommend
that you check yourself

316
00:33:17.996 --> 00:33:22.166
into a hospital for complete
and comprehensive evaluation.

317
00:33:22.166 --> 00:33:23.334
I'm fine.

318
00:33:24.752 --> 00:33:27.046
- Seeing dolls that hang themselves.

319
00:33:27.046 --> 00:33:28.589
Haven't
you ever had a nightmare?

320
00:33:29.215 --> 00:33:30.299
- Was it a nightmare?

321
00:33:34.345 --> 00:33:36.389
Tell me what you see.

322
00:33:48.693 --> 00:33:50.236
A real doll.

323
00:33:50.486 --> 00:33:51.571
- Real or not?

324
00:33:54.365 --> 00:33:55.199
Real.

325
00:33:55.199 --> 00:33:56.200
Real doll.

326
00:33:56.367 --> 00:33:58.119
- This is a patient of mine.

327
00:33:58.202 --> 00:34:01.456
I thought it might be helpful
for the two of you to meet.

328
00:34:01.581 --> 00:34:03.541
Who applied his makeup?

329
00:34:03.666 --> 00:34:05.001
- You can talk directly to me.

330
00:34:07.086 --> 00:34:10.089
Oh. who applies your makeup?

331
00:34:10.173 --> 00:34:11.591
- I only talk when I'm winded up.

332
00:34:13.926 --> 00:34:15.178
- Go through the motions.

333
00:34:24.103 --> 00:34:24.937
That's it.

334
00:34:25.938 --> 00:34:26.856
Keep winding.

335
00:34:27.065 --> 00:34:28.649
Wind him all the way up.

336
00:34:29.734 --> 00:34:31.819
Wind him all the way up.

337
00:34:44.373 --> 00:34:45.124
Hurry.

338
00:34:45.124 --> 00:34:46.417
The syringe on the table.

339
00:34:46.667 --> 00:34:48.044
Marmalade. the syringe.

340
00:34:48.044 --> 00:34:48.878
Hurry.

341
00:34:49.504 --> 00:34:50.338
- Ah.

342
00:35:00.014 --> 00:35:01.432
- Sorry.

343
00:35:01.766 --> 00:35:05.603
It's part of the master
manifesto I was reading about

344
00:35:05.603 --> 00:35:09.649
belonging to the brilliant
psychiatrist Luberg Pillowski

345
00:35:09.649 --> 00:35:11.901
dating back to the last century.

346
00:35:11.901 --> 00:35:13.402
I just thought the procedure

347
00:35:13.402 --> 00:35:16.239
would be beneficial to both of you.

348
00:35:16.239 --> 00:35:17.949
Your therapy's deadly.

349
00:35:17.949 --> 00:35:21.077
You're associating my condition
with this psycho maniac.

350
00:35:21.077 --> 00:35:23.704
- There are similarities.

351
00:35:23.913 --> 00:35:25.456
The only similarity

352
00:35:25.456 --> 00:35:27.583
is your twisted thinking to his.

353
00:35:27.834 --> 00:35:29.127
You're fired.

354
00:35:29.377 --> 00:35:31.045
- I wouldn't recommend that.

355
00:35:33.714 --> 00:35:34.841
I wouldn't either.

356
00:35:34.924 --> 00:35:35.925
Silly girl.

357
00:35:38.427 --> 00:35:39.971
Marmalade.

358
00:35:40.638 --> 00:35:43.141
Therapy is still in session.

359
00:35:55.236 --> 00:35:57.488
- Think if I leave my cart out here.

360
00:35:57.488 --> 00:35:58.698
anyone's gonna steal it?

361
00:35:59.115 --> 00:36:01.659
Okay. it's only whole life belongings.

362
00:36:11.961 --> 00:36:14.088
Okay. where's the scoundrel?

363
00:36:16.048 --> 00:36:18.217
Where are the scoundrels?

364
00:36:18.217 --> 00:36:19.927
Where are the scoundrels?

365
00:36:20.386 --> 00:36:25.224
Ah. I see.

366
00:36:25.892 --> 00:36:27.143
Aren't
you going to pick it up?

367
00:36:27.685 --> 00:36:29.061
- I ain't gonna touch him.

368
00:36:29.061 --> 00:36:32.565
Leave my prints. be falsely
accused and get life.

369
00:36:32.648 --> 00:36:34.192
It's only a doll.

370
00:36:36.194 --> 00:36:37.195
- Mm hm.

371
00:36:37.528 --> 00:36:39.614
Ones that hang themselves.

372
00:36:42.325 --> 00:36:46.787
But it's what they might
do that concerns me more.

373
00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:48.831
What else?

374
00:36:48.831 --> 00:36:53.461
- Those legends. the spooky
legends. fairy tales.

375
00:36:54.253 --> 00:36:57.673
old wives tale spoke of cruel atrocities.

376
00:36:58.549 --> 00:37:00.218
Do you have a plan?

377
00:37:00.259 --> 00:37:01.510
- Do have a plan.

378
00:37:02.637 --> 00:37:03.888
Find the headmaster.

379
00:37:08.684 --> 00:37:10.353
What are you doing?

380
00:37:11.479 --> 00:37:12.313
- Ah.

381
00:37:13.231 --> 00:37:18.236
This has a theoretically indefinite pitch

382
00:37:18.277 --> 00:37:23.741
when rung in the ear of the headmaster.

383
00:37:30.498 --> 00:37:31.540
Found the maestro.

384
00:37:32.291 --> 00:37:33.501
Come here.

385
00:37:33.918 --> 00:37:35.169
Come over here.

386
00:37:36.921 --> 00:37:37.755
Take this paper.

387
00:37:38.714 --> 00:37:39.548
Hold it up.

388
00:37:41.592 --> 00:37:43.052
All right.

389
00:37:46.097 --> 00:37:47.265
What's it say?

390
00:37:50.309 --> 00:37:52.603
Spunkneck's curse coming.

391
00:37:54.981 --> 00:37:55.815
Oh my God.

392
00:37:55.815 --> 00:37:56.857
What does it mean?

393
00:37:57.525 --> 00:37:58.859
- As in the dream state

394
00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:02.238
where time is different
than the waking state.

395
00:38:03.322 --> 00:38:07.576
So to is time in the world of dolls

396
00:38:07.702 --> 00:38:11.455
for sure in the world of Spunkneck dolls.

397
00:38:11.455 --> 00:38:12.999
I think you're scaring me.

398
00:38:13.457 --> 00:38:14.417
- Hold on.

399
00:38:15.126 --> 00:38:16.752
It gets worse.

400
00:38:16.877 --> 00:38:22.550
Once normally harmless. inanimate.

401
00:38:22.967 --> 00:38:27.972
rubber. porcelain. marbled
eyed dolls turned wicked

402
00:38:28.597 --> 00:38:31.642
when the headmaster doll maker Spunkneck

403
00:38:31.642 --> 00:38:34.729
fell to the dark side
stemming from childhood abuse.

404
00:38:34.729 --> 00:38:36.731
which he could no longer keep contained.

405
00:38:37.231 --> 00:38:40.443
And so his evil desire to spoil

406
00:38:40.443 --> 00:38:43.946
little happy innocent boys and girls.

407
00:38:45.323 --> 00:38:46.699
I haven't seen jealousy.

408
00:38:48.826 --> 00:38:49.660
He felt cheated.

409
00:38:50.953 --> 00:38:55.374
And so he jinxed his future
creations with a dark spell.

410
00:38:55.374 --> 00:38:59.086
Doomsday internal clocks
so that each and every doll

411
00:38:59.086 --> 00:39:01.505
would enact its own horror doomsday.

412
00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:04.759
Doll Armageddon.

413
00:39:04.759 --> 00:39:06.385
- Find another place to sleep.

414
00:39:07.762 --> 00:39:08.804
I will not.

415
00:39:08.846 --> 00:39:11.682
And I inherited these
dolls from my grandmother.

416
00:39:12.099 --> 00:39:14.935
They're like my little
brothers and sisters.

417
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:18.856
- Made from the dark side.

418
00:39:20.983 --> 00:39:23.361
I can't abort them.

419
00:39:23.361 --> 00:39:24.487
- That's your own peril.

420
00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:27.698
We all innocent inside.

421
00:39:27.698 --> 00:39:30.576
Just need to be loved
and given the chance.

422
00:39:30.576 --> 00:39:32.745
- Just like your grandmother.

423
00:39:32.912 --> 00:39:33.746
Heart of gold.

424
00:39:35.164 --> 00:39:37.375
Tell my
wannabe boyfriend that.

425
00:39:37.375 --> 00:39:39.543
- He don't sound like the one.

426
00:39:39.543 --> 00:39:41.420
Let may tell you there's a time for love

427
00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:43.422
and a time for wise resolution.

428
00:39:47.468 --> 00:39:48.302
Look at that.

429
00:39:48.302 --> 00:39:49.136
My cart's still here.

430
00:39:49.345 --> 00:39:50.638
.

431
00:39:53.724 --> 00:39:55.976
Chains as strong as its weakest link.

432
00:43:57.009 --> 00:43:59.386
Take me to the lights.

433
00:43:59.386 --> 00:44:00.638
- What lights?

434
00:44:00.638 --> 00:44:01.472
Any lights.

435
00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:02.556
Just lights.

436
00:44:02.556 --> 00:44:03.891
- Are you afraid of dark?

437
00:44:03.891 --> 00:44:05.184
Lately. yes.

438
00:44:49.728 --> 00:44:51.188
- I should take you home now.

439
00:44:53.023 --> 00:44:55.025
Yes. you can take me home.

440
00:47:28.178 --> 00:47:29.388
Please. grandmother.

441
00:47:29.388 --> 00:47:31.932
Don't let anything happen to me.

442
00:47:31.932 --> 00:47:32.766
Happen to me.

443
00:47:33.267 --> 00:47:34.476
Happen to me.

444
00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:01.813
What the fuck?

445
00:49:26.129 --> 00:49:27.506
Marmalade.

446
00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:31.468
Either I'm dead and dreaming
and you're dead and dreaming.

447
00:49:31.468 --> 00:49:33.845
Can you just talk with me for a while?

448
00:49:34.221 --> 00:49:35.138
Geez.

449
00:49:35.555 --> 00:49:37.557
What's wrong. Marmalade?

450
00:49:38.642 --> 00:49:39.226
Nothing.

451
00:49:39.226 --> 00:49:40.185
I just need to talk.

452
00:49:40.852 --> 00:49:42.562
Yeah. sure.

453
00:49:42.562 --> 00:49:44.147
We can talk forever if you want.

454
00:49:44.398 --> 00:49:45.148
Gilbert.

455
00:49:46.441 --> 00:49:47.234
Yeah.

456
00:49:48.443 --> 00:49:50.946
You know I
inherited my grandmother condo.

457
00:49:51.571 --> 00:49:54.282
God knows when
you're going to invite me over.

458
00:49:54.533 --> 00:49:56.576
Well. you
know. it's filled with dolls.

459
00:49:56.785 --> 00:49:57.661
Told me that.

460
00:49:57.869 --> 00:49:59.371
I haven't been well.

461
00:49:59.538 --> 00:50:02.207
What if I told you I
just feel like screaming?

462
00:50:05.293 --> 00:50:06.795
Well. go ahead.

463
00:51:13.111 --> 00:51:14.321
Good witch.

464
00:51:14.404 --> 00:51:17.074
You're going to protect
me from any evil curses.

465
00:51:17.074 --> 00:51:17.824
Won't you?

466
00:51:21.078 --> 00:51:22.287
Will you?

467
00:51:27.793 --> 00:51:29.795
Strange things to say the least

468
00:51:29.795 --> 00:51:32.923
have been taking place
with grandmother's dolls.

469
00:51:32.923 --> 00:51:35.383
Sometimes I think I'm going nuts.

470
00:51:35.383 --> 00:51:36.259
Okay.

471
00:51:36.259 --> 00:51:37.469
Do your magic.

472
00:51:37.469 --> 00:51:40.180
Bless you and bless this place.

473
00:51:42.265 --> 00:51:43.975
It's a gloomy day.

474
00:51:43.975 --> 00:51:46.561
Marmalade. don't be depressed.

475
00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:51.650
No. not you.

476
00:51:53.985 --> 00:51:56.363
I know none of you wish me any harm.

477
00:51:56.363 --> 00:51:58.365
You're all dealing with your own pain.

478
00:51:58.490 --> 00:52:00.367
I know how hard it is sometimes.

479
00:52:00.408 --> 00:52:02.160
I'm not aborting you.

480
00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:03.620
I just have to get some air.

481
00:52:17.926 --> 00:52:19.261
One. two. three.

482
00:52:19.344 --> 00:52:22.180
Four. five. six.

483
00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:25.475
Seven. eight. nine. 10. 11.

484
00:52:26.476 --> 00:52:29.688
9.999.

485
00:52:31.481 --> 00:52:32.315
10.000.

486
00:52:33.984 --> 00:52:35.318
Too many cars.

487
00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:07.762
That was so much fun.

488
00:55:07.762 --> 00:55:09.597
We did a great show tonight.

489
00:55:09.597 --> 00:55:12.183
The audience wants an encore but remember.

490
00:55:14.311 --> 00:55:16.271
Always leave them wanting more.

491
00:55:16.521 --> 00:55:17.689
I feel good now.

492
00:55:17.689 --> 00:55:20.942
I think I'll be able to
get a good night's sleep.

493
00:55:20.942 --> 00:55:21.776
Goodnight.

494
00:55:39.085 --> 00:55:39.919
Ugh.

495
00:55:40.128 --> 00:55:41.629
What's that smell?

496
00:56:51.491 --> 00:56:53.618
Goodnight. Rose Burlesque.

497
00:57:20.895 --> 00:57:22.772
Come up and see me some time.

498
00:57:22.772 --> 00:57:24.023
We're having a grand old time in here.

499
00:57:24.023 --> 00:57:25.900
We're drinking whiskey and wine

500
00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:27.360
and we're dancing the night away.

501
00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:29.904
Come make yourself comfortable.

502
00:57:29.904 --> 00:57:31.156
My knee behind my shoulder.

503
00:57:31.156 --> 00:57:34.451
I just get stuck in a
pretzel and it's oh my.

504
00:57:34.451 --> 00:57:36.494
Kicking my feet. I got
a rip in my stockings.

505
00:57:36.494 --> 00:57:38.079
I gotta be more careful.

506
00:57:38.079 --> 00:57:39.247
We're above the law.

507
00:57:40.623 --> 00:57:42.792
Up here is rather stimulating.

508
00:57:42.792 --> 00:57:45.712
I got to say I'm feeling
quite ladylike at this moment.

509
00:57:58.850 --> 00:58:00.226
I need your advice.

510
00:58:00.393 --> 00:58:02.228
You're both older and wiser.

511
00:58:02.228 --> 00:58:03.480
What is wrong with me?

512
00:58:09.903 --> 00:58:11.779
I guess you can't hear me.

513
00:58:11.946 --> 00:58:14.240
You're in your own lovely world.

514
00:58:17.368 --> 00:58:18.870
Thanks anyway.

515
00:58:28.296 --> 00:58:30.507
I thought it might help if we all got

516
00:58:30.507 --> 00:58:32.258
to know each other a little better.

517
00:58:33.218 --> 00:58:35.553
Tell each other our world.

518
00:58:35.553 --> 00:58:36.888
Vent so to speak.

519
00:58:37.347 --> 00:58:40.433
It's such a terrible thing
when one feels so bad

520
00:58:40.433 --> 00:58:42.185
that they feel there is no way out

521
00:58:42.185 --> 00:58:44.103
besides doing away with oneself.

522
00:58:44.896 --> 00:58:45.772
So sad.

523
00:58:46.731 --> 00:58:48.107
I understand.

524
00:58:48.274 --> 00:58:50.652
You'd rather not let
everyone know your business.

525
00:58:50.652 --> 00:58:53.404
Well. just know ever you feel like it.

526
00:58:53.404 --> 00:58:54.822
you can confide in me.

527
00:58:54.822 --> 00:58:56.074
I won't say a word.

528
00:58:58.535 --> 00:59:00.036
I'm going to try to sleep now.

529
01:01:26.265 --> 01:01:28.726
Sh. they're out there.

530
01:01:31.312 --> 01:01:34.190
Show us your omnipresence.

531
01:01:35.066 --> 01:01:37.735
Oh. it's surrounding our bodies.

532
01:01:39.278 --> 01:01:43.741
We besiege you to grace
us with your presence

533
01:01:43.741 --> 01:01:45.910
in any shape or form.

534
01:02:06.848 --> 01:02:10.101
I think it's clear.

535
01:04:05.007 --> 01:04:06.425
- You okay. miss?

536
01:04:29.156 --> 01:04:31.075
You want me to call a doctor. miss?

537
01:04:32.201 --> 01:04:34.370
They can't help me.

538
01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:36.372
Nobody can help me.

539
01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:21.459
I tried.

540
01:05:21.459 --> 01:05:22.960
I really tried.

541
01:06:14.845 --> 01:06:16.973
Whoever
finds this note first.

542
01:06:17.890 --> 01:06:20.518
let it be kept for my lawyers.

543
01:06:20.559 --> 01:06:24.105
I leave everything to my
granddaughter Marmalade.

544
01:06:24.355 --> 01:06:26.107
That sweet child.

545
01:06:26.107 --> 01:06:28.901
My husband passed away a few years ago.

546
01:06:29.986 --> 01:06:32.863
It's been so lonely and unbearable

547
01:06:32.905 --> 01:06:35.157
that I no longer have
the will to continue.

548
01:06:36.242 --> 01:06:38.119
My heart is empty.

549
01:06:38.202 --> 01:06:43.165
I leave this condo and all
my beloved dolls to Marmalade

550
01:06:43.457 --> 01:06:46.252
for her to enjoy as I have.

551
01:06:47.253 --> 01:06:50.089
Please do not tell her of my suicide

552
01:06:50.089 --> 01:06:52.508
for it would make her so sad.

553
01:06:52.508 --> 01:06:56.971
Let her think I passed
away by natural causes.

554
01:06:56.971 --> 01:07:00.057
My wish for her is to find the love

555
01:07:00.057 --> 01:07:02.560
and hope that I have lost.

556
01:07:03.144 --> 01:07:04.353
Goodbye.

557
01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:18.868
It's quite
brilliant. I must say.

558
01:07:19.243 --> 01:07:21.495
Quantum algorithms creating

559
01:07:21.495 --> 01:07:24.623
possibly their own virtual realities.

560
01:07:26.417 --> 01:07:27.585
- Thank you. doc.

561
01:07:28.544 --> 01:07:32.965
You give a plant water and
sunlight. it will grow.

562
01:07:34.383 --> 01:07:37.803
You give structure enough
room for evolution.

563
01:07:37.803 --> 01:07:39.055
it will grow. too.

564
01:07:39.055 --> 01:07:40.222
- And grow it has.

565
01:07:40.222 --> 01:07:45.019
Spunkneck. your latest
dolls are full human size.

566
01:07:45.019 --> 01:07:46.562
- Sure.

567
01:07:46.562 --> 01:07:49.273
The size has grown with consciousness.

568
01:07:49.273 --> 01:07:50.941
Take Marmalade for example.

569
01:07:53.110 --> 01:07:55.738
Marmalade easily frightened.

570
01:07:56.405 --> 01:07:57.823
Must be taken care of.

571
01:07:57.823 --> 01:08:00.367
Her kindly grandmother has
left her a condo of dolls

572
01:08:00.367 --> 01:08:04.205
to keep her company as she
learns to live with her fears.

573
01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:06.582
Come on. let me show you this one.

574
01:08:17.218 --> 01:08:20.721
Gilbert. a bother to Marmalade.

575
01:08:20.721 --> 01:08:23.557
and she doesn't have the
hesitation to show it.

576
01:08:23.682 --> 01:08:25.267
He loves her no matter what.

577
01:08:25.267 --> 01:08:27.103
Eventually they will wed.

578
01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:30.314
- So what's the mysterious ingredient?

579
01:08:30.314 --> 01:08:31.649
- How so?

580
01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:34.151
- Labs all around the
world have come close

581
01:08:34.151 --> 01:08:36.612
to creating a self
perpetuating virtual reality.

582
01:08:36.612 --> 01:08:38.030
but all of them have failed.

583
01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:40.741
- Love.

584
01:08:41.826 --> 01:08:43.744
Love will give them a chance.

585
01:08:45.162 --> 01:08:46.539
How have you been feeling?

586
01:08:46.539 --> 01:08:47.414
- Good.

587
01:08:47.623 --> 01:08:50.793
Leave the past in the past
if the past don't help.

588
01:08:50.793 --> 01:08:51.961
- I gotta remember that one.

589
01:08:53.045 --> 01:08:57.049
- You know. sometimes a
curse can be a blessing.

590
01:08:59.009 --> 01:09:00.553
How much I owe you?

591
01:09:00.553 --> 01:09:02.930
- This one's on the house.

592
01:09:03.097 --> 01:09:04.348
Aloha.

593
01:09:21.949 --> 01:09:24.201
Move or die.

594
01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:27.580
These lines on the road
are hypnotizing me.

595
01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:29.123
I feel like painting over them.

596
01:09:31.542 --> 01:09:34.712
Time is money and you're
costing me a fortune. slowpokes.

597
01:09:35.796 --> 01:09:37.756
This is giving me anxiety.

598
01:09:40.885 --> 01:09:43.512
Do you have your stick
shift in reverse gear?

599
01:09:43.512 --> 01:09:45.181
Short seems like it.

600
01:09:46.307 --> 01:09:49.351
Where did you learn to drive?

601
01:09:50.603 --> 01:09:52.021
I'm going to invent my most

602
01:09:52.021 --> 01:09:54.273
sinister doll ever because of you.

603
01:09:57.109 --> 01:09:59.486
Horse and buggy would be faster.

604
01:09:59.486 --> 01:10:01.614
This is giving me anxiety.

605
01:10:02.698 --> 01:10:04.575
This is giving me anxiety.

606
01:10:05.659 --> 01:10:08.329
Is everyone gonna drive
the same time I'm driving?

607
01:10:08.329 --> 01:10:09.330
What's wrong with them?

608
01:10:09.330 --> 01:10:12.291
My dolls have better sense than
these moron Sunday drivers.

609
01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:15.669
I hate looking at these boring buildings.

610
01:10:15.669 --> 01:10:17.671
Where's the dancing girls?

611
01:10:19.465 --> 01:10:22.134
I'm going to program my
new dolls to drive cars

612
01:10:22.134 --> 01:10:24.553
and run you over in the
middle of the night.

613
01:10:25.596 --> 01:10:27.973
I should have bought a
tractor instead of a small car

614
01:10:27.973 --> 01:10:30.226
so I can bulldoze over these slowpokes.

615
01:10:31.352 --> 01:10:33.312
Get out of your cars and go shopping.

616
01:10:33.312 --> 01:10:34.855
Go buy yourself a doll.

617
01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:39.401
Move or die.

618
01:10:40.861 --> 01:10:42.947
Traffic is for people with no life.

619
01:10:54.708 --> 01:10:58.045
- Your formula is not complete.

620
01:10:58.045 --> 01:11:01.298
You cannot have love without truth.

621
01:13:07.466 --> 01:13:09.218
- Don't worry. Estelle.

622
01:13:09.218 --> 01:13:10.594
I got it covered.

623
01:13:11.929 --> 01:13:13.555
Love and truth.
