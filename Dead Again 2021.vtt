(imitating "Jaws" theme)

67
00:08:05.953 --> 00:08:07.921
- I don't know what that is.

68
00:08:07.921 --> 00:08:12.926
- It's "Jaws". everyone on
the planet knows "Jaws".

69
00:08:14.094 --> 00:08:14.995
- I don't really know
what you're doing.

70
00:08:14.995 --> 00:08:16.630
is it an initiation thing?

71
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.666
You know. first day
on the job and stuff?

72
00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:23.170
- No. it's 'cause
you've got the same name

73
00:08:23.203 --> 00:08:24.672
as Roy Scheider character.

74
00:08:24.672 --> 00:08:26.674
Master cinema survivor?

75
00:08:26.674 --> 00:08:28.709
Only one to survive
the shark attacks.

76
00:08:28.742 --> 00:08:30.744
he blew it to smithereens.

77
00:08:30.778 --> 00:08:33.180
- Oh. did he. okay.

78
00:08:33.213 --> 00:08:37.951
- Oh come on. your name's
Brody. same as Scheider's.

79
00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:42.122
Oh I can see you're gonna be

80
00:08:42.122 --> 00:08:43.390
Well come on. what did you do

81
00:08:43.423 --> 00:08:45.225
to get lumbered in
a place like this?

82
00:08:45.225 --> 00:08:47.427
- No nothing. I mean there
was a small incident.

83
00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.962
- Tell ya what. don't worry.

84
00:08:48.962 --> 00:08:50.864
Grab ya coat. I'll give

85
00:08:50.931 --> 00:08:52.666
of Little Pitchfield.

86
00:08:58.338 --> 00:09:01.408
By the way son. what
is your first name?

87
00:09:01.408 --> 00:09:02.843
- Oh. do you really wanna know?

88
00:09:02.843 --> 00:09:05.212
- Well yeah. I wouldn't
have asked otherwise.

89
00:09:05.245 --> 00:09:07.414
Around here. we're all
on first name terms.

90
00:09:08.415 --> 00:09:09.750
- It's Bruce.

91
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.785
- (laughing) Bruce?

92
00:09:13.987 --> 00:09:15.455
- What?

93
00:09:15.455 --> 00:09:17.925
- Name of the shark in the
film. it was Bruce (laughing).

94
00:09:20.293 --> 00:09:21.128
- Was it really?

95
00:09:22.963 --> 00:09:25.365
I thought I was
named after my uncle.

96
00:09:25.432 --> 00:09:27.300
Police Sergeant Cooper?

97
00:09:29.036 --> 00:09:31.905
(Cooper Laughing)

98
00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:35.876
Police Sergeant Cooper.

99
00:09:35.876 --> 00:09:37.277
- Starsky.

100
00:09:37.344 --> 00:09:38.245
- What?

101
00:09:38.245 --> 00:09:40.113
- My first name. Starsky.

102
00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.082
- Starsky?

103
00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:44.551
- Yeah. apparently
I was conceived

104
00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:46.319
during the very first episode.

105
00:09:46.386 --> 00:09:49.422
Good old Mum and Dad.
God rest their souls.

106
00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:51.158
They loved that show.

107
00:09:51.224 --> 00:09:52.425
- Oh what show?

108
00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:54.261
- Only the greatest cop
show ever seen on TV.

109
00:09:55.195 --> 00:09:57.197
- I don't know it.

110
00:09:59.032 --> 00:10:00.801
- "Starsky and Hutch"?

111
00:10:00.801 --> 00:10:02.803
First aired in 1975.

112
00:10:02.836 --> 00:10:05.505
- I was born in
the 90s. remember?

113
00:10:05.505 --> 00:10:06.640
Sorry.

114
00:10:06.674 --> 00:10:07.841
- It was awesome.

115
00:10:07.841 --> 00:10:10.844
I mean. they had
girls. guns. oh cars!

116
00:10:10.844 --> 00:10:12.345
What more could you
want from a show?

117
00:10:12.345 --> 00:10:16.183
I mean they had this Ford
Grand Torino painted red

118
00:10:16.216 --> 00:10:19.486
and it had this fantastic white
stripe down the side of it.

119
00:10:19.486 --> 00:10:20.654
It was awesome.

120
00:10:20.721 --> 00:10:24.457
- Well I'll have to look
it up then. Starsky.

121
00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:27.795
- No. Starsky.

122
00:10:27.795 --> 00:10:29.162
- Yeah?

123
00:10:29.196 --> 00:10:30.463
- You fell for the
oldest trick in the book.

124
00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:31.932
the old fake name joke.

125
00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:33.533
It's not Starsky. it's Shaun.

126
00:10:35.135 --> 00:10:38.305
Oh you are gonna be a
barrel of laughs aren't you?

127
00:10:38.338 --> 00:10:39.572
We're gonna wind you up rotten.

128
00:10:39.572 --> 00:10:40.708
Come on. son.

129
00:10:40.708 --> 00:10:43.010
(laughing)

130
00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:47.080
(dramatic music)

131
00:10:58.726 --> 00:11:01.695
- This place must have been
beautiful in its heyday.

132
00:11:01.762 --> 00:11:05.265
- I think it was an old hospital
for the criminally insane.

133
00:11:05.265 --> 00:11:07.667
- You'd have fitted
in perfectly then.

134
00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:08.501
- You think?

135
00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:14.341
- Yes. you're a rogue.
a cad. a bandit.

136
00:11:15.709 --> 00:11:17.745
- English lit is
your thing then.

137
00:11:17.778 --> 00:11:20.180
Anyway. I thought
women love a rogue.

138
00:11:20.213 --> 00:11:21.882
- Not if the man's a prick.

139
00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.758
I just wish we could
explore this place.

140
00:11:31.759 --> 00:11:32.592
- Come on then.

141
00:11:32.592 --> 00:11:33.761
- We shouldn't.

142
00:11:33.794 --> 00:11:34.995
- Why not?

143
00:11:34.995 --> 00:11:38.098
- Someone could be in
there and then what?

144
00:11:38.131 --> 00:11:41.234
- There's nobody around.
the place is abandoned.

145
00:11:41.234 --> 00:11:43.236
People 'round here
are backwards.

146
00:11:43.236 --> 00:11:45.572
Come on. it's like
going back in time.

147
00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:49.910
And they never locked the doors.

148
00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:55.783
- All right but I'm not
having sex with you.

149
00:11:55.783 --> 00:11:57.250
if that's your caddish plan.

150
00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:58.051
- Come on.

151
00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:04.424
(eerie tense music)

152
00:12:07.427 --> 00:12:10.163
(sheep bleating)

153
00:12:16.036 --> 00:12:18.638
(dog barking)

154
00:12:23.543 --> 00:12:25.545
- Definitely not like London.

155
00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:26.579
Phone booths work.

156
00:12:34.387 --> 00:12:35.622
(bells tolling)

157
00:12:35.622 --> 00:12:39.259
- There she is. in all
her glory. the church.

158
00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:43.130
Even the vicar only
had one follower

159
00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:45.198
and that was his cleaner.

160
00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:47.200
Come on Bruce. let's go

161
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.170
and see if we can drum
up a generation gap.

162
00:12:57.077 --> 00:12:59.246
(laughing)

163
00:12:59.246 --> 00:13:00.747
- Are you always this comical?

164
00:13:00.747 --> 00:13:02.682
I thought that on this
job you have to be.

165
00:13:02.715 --> 00:13:04.717
you have to be
vigilant all the time.

166
00:13:04.717 --> 00:13:06.119
- Vigilant?

167
00:13:06.153 --> 00:13:08.155
You'll soon find out
nothing happens 'round here.

168
00:13:08.221 --> 00:13:10.723
- Well. my training
taught me to be prepared

169
00:13:10.757 --> 00:13:13.126
for anything and
everything at any time.

170
00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:14.928
day or night. on duty or off.

171
00:13:16.429 --> 00:13:18.465
- Well. I tell you something
they aint prepared you for.

172
00:13:18.465 --> 00:13:19.366
- What's that?

173
00:13:19.432 --> 00:13:21.234
- Boredom. sheer boredom.

174
00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:22.502
Nothing happens 'round here.

175
00:13:22.502 --> 00:13:24.838
It's like a morgue
in a recession.

176
00:13:24.838 --> 00:13:26.673
- Well. then maybe
we need to go out

177
00:13:26.673 --> 00:13:27.574
and find crime. you know.

178
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.042
I mean it happens it everywhere.

179
00:13:29.042 --> 00:13:31.044
They say it's just hidden
behind closed doors.

180
00:13:31.078 --> 00:13:34.882
- I used to be just like you
when I first started. keen.

181
00:13:34.882 --> 00:13:36.216
- And how long ago was that?

182
00:13:36.249 --> 00:13:38.285
If you don't mind me asking.

183
00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:39.819
- 25 years.

184
00:13:39.887 --> 00:13:41.588
Actually. I've been
in Little Pitchfield

185
00:13:41.588 --> 00:13:44.657
for 24 and half
now and this is it.

186
00:13:45.859 --> 00:13:47.127
Rush hour.

187
00:13:47.127 --> 00:13:48.195
(laughs)

188
00:13:48.261 --> 00:13:49.863
I know everybody 'round here.

189
00:13:49.863 --> 00:13:51.364
all their ins and their outs

190
00:13:51.431 --> 00:13:52.966
and all their dirty laundry

191
00:13:52.966 --> 00:13:56.003
and believe me. Mrs.
Broomfield at the vicarage

192
00:13:56.036 --> 00:13:57.370
she's got some very
dirty underwear.

193
00:13:57.404 --> 00:13:58.638
- Right. okay. yeah.

194
00:13:58.671 --> 00:14:00.974
A bit sexist that. isn't it?

195
00:14:00.974 --> 00:14:01.909
- Sexist?

196
00:14:01.909 --> 00:14:02.910
No.

197
00:14:02.943 --> 00:14:05.212
That's why you're P.C. Brody.

198
00:14:05.212 --> 00:14:07.347
stop being so PC. Bruce.

199
00:14:08.548 --> 00:14:10.117
- Well government
guidelines suggest

200
00:14:10.183 --> 00:14:11.418
that we should
actually investigate

201
00:14:11.418 --> 00:14:13.453
all hate crime initiators. so.

202
00:14:14.554 --> 00:14:15.923
- It's like living in the past.

203
00:14:15.923 --> 00:14:18.325
No one cares about
political connectiveness.

204
00:14:18.391 --> 00:14:20.660
They just go about
their lives as normal.

205
00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:24.497
Same old boring thing
day after day after day.

206
00:14:24.497 --> 00:14:25.832
- There's must be some crime.

207
00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:28.201
Otherwise that would
mean Little Pitchfield

208
00:14:28.235 --> 00:14:30.170
is literally a
crime free location.

209
00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:31.638
- Let me tell you something.

210
00:14:31.671 --> 00:14:34.241
Little Pitchfield has been
off every crime report

211
00:14:34.241 --> 00:14:37.177
and statistic in
the last 17 years.

212
00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.012
No. no really. really.

213
00:14:39.012 --> 00:14:40.613
I read about it somewhere.

214
00:14:40.613 --> 00:14:45.618
Something about us making
the good cops look bad.

215
00:14:46.486 --> 00:14:48.255
So they just leave us off now.

216
00:14:48.255 --> 00:14:49.256
- Hang on.

217
00:14:49.256 --> 00:14:50.657
- Brody. wait!

218
00:14:54.294 --> 00:14:55.795
- Excuse me. sir.

219
00:14:55.828 --> 00:14:57.164
You do realise that
public urination

220
00:14:57.164 --> 00:14:59.967
is a offence under the
Public Order Act of 1986

221
00:14:59.967 --> 00:15:02.970
and as such that can be
considered indecent exposure.

222
00:15:03.003 --> 00:15:04.671
- Nicely said. son.

223
00:15:04.671 --> 00:15:05.505
There's no crime here.

224
00:15:05.505 --> 00:15:06.906
Billy.

225
00:15:06.974 --> 00:15:08.875
What have I told you
about peeing up that tree?

226
00:15:08.875 --> 00:15:09.709
- Sorry. Shaun.

227
00:15:09.709 --> 00:15:10.577
- Go on. son.

228
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.345
Go about your business.

229
00:15:12.379 --> 00:15:14.614
(laughing)

230
00:15:17.517 --> 00:15:19.652
- What you do that for?

231
00:15:19.719 --> 00:15:21.788
That. that's an offence.

232
00:15:21.788 --> 00:15:23.323
Public urination.

233
00:15:24.291 --> 00:15:25.292
- Look around.

234
00:15:25.325 --> 00:15:26.859
What public?

235
00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:29.696
Anyway. he always gets it wrong.

236
00:15:32.532 --> 00:15:34.267
- So hang on wrong?

237
00:15:34.301 --> 00:15:36.169
- Yeah. he's peeing
up the wrong tree.

238
00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:38.838
- What?

239
00:15:38.838 --> 00:15:42.409
- Yeah. the peeing tree
is four down on the left

240
00:15:42.475 --> 00:15:45.278
but he's a bit thick in the
head. bit of a simpleton.

241
00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:46.446
- The government
guidelines suggest we call

242
00:15:46.513 --> 00:15:48.681
that a disability. actually.

243
00:15:48.715 --> 00:15:49.882
- Disability?

244
00:15:49.882 --> 00:15:53.220
He just doesn't know
his left from his right.

245
00:15:57.257 --> 00:15:59.259
- Do you do anything
by the book?

246
00:15:59.259 --> 00:16:00.793
- All depends what book it is.

247
00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:04.264
- The Police Handbook.
the guidelines.

248
00:16:04.264 --> 00:16:08.235
- Ah. there it is.
the bloody guidelines.

249
00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:10.837
Let me tell you something
about the guidelines.

250
00:16:10.837 --> 00:16:12.039
they're only put
there 'cause someone

251
00:16:12.072 --> 00:16:13.873
can't make a decision
between what's right

252
00:16:13.873 --> 00:16:15.042
and what's wrong.

253
00:16:15.042 --> 00:16:16.209
Ah. ah. ah.

254
00:16:16.209 --> 00:16:18.111
Until it's no
longer a guideline.

255
00:16:18.178 --> 00:16:20.180
See. I can do whatever
I want when I want

256
00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:24.417
because 'round here.
I'm the boss. number one

257
00:16:24.417 --> 00:16:26.419
and if you think
some snotty nose.

258
00:16:26.419 --> 00:16:28.588
pencil pushing
guideline and your PC

259
00:16:28.588 --> 00:16:29.822
is gonna come into
my neck of the woods

260
00:16:29.889 --> 00:16:32.059
and tell me what to
do. well then you've

261
00:16:32.059 --> 00:16:33.760
got another thing coming.

262
00:16:33.793 --> 00:16:35.462
Well do you get me?

263
00:16:35.462 --> 00:16:36.329
- Yes. sir.

264
00:16:36.363 --> 00:16:38.665
- Well do ya. punk?

265
00:16:38.665 --> 00:16:40.467
- Yes. sir.

266
00:16:40.467 --> 00:16:41.468
- (laughs) Did you get it?

267
00:16:41.468 --> 00:16:43.803
Clint Eastwood. Dirty Harry.

268
00:16:44.971 --> 00:16:47.307
- Yeah. I think
I've seen that one.

269
00:16:47.307 --> 00:16:48.708
- See. can you
imagine what it's like

270
00:16:48.708 --> 00:16:50.377
to be Detective Callahan?

271
00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:51.711
Chasing down suspects.
hunting them down

272
00:16:52.879 --> 00:16:54.081
and shooting the bastards.

273
00:16:54.081 --> 00:16:55.082
(mimics gunshot)

274
00:16:55.082 --> 00:16:56.916
(laughs)

275
00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:58.451
That was my dream.

276
00:17:05.325 --> 00:17:06.659
- 17 years.

277
00:17:06.693 --> 00:17:07.527
- Huh?

278
00:17:09.962 --> 00:17:12.165
- You said that statistically
Little Pitchfield

279
00:17:12.165 --> 00:17:14.501
has been off the police
records for 17 years.

280
00:17:14.534 --> 00:17:17.537
so what happened 17 years ago?

281
00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:20.240
- Now that. my boy.
is another story.

282
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.675
- So. what happened?

283
00:17:22.675 --> 00:17:24.911
- Well. the villagers
said it was some sort

284
00:17:24.944 --> 00:17:26.746
of alien invasion.

285
00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.916
- Right. okay another
one of your jokes.

286
00:17:29.949 --> 00:17:31.050
- No. no. no. no.

287
00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.285
This is no joke.

288
00:17:32.319 --> 00:17:34.321
It was the last time
anything interesting

289
00:17:34.321 --> 00:17:35.488
happened around here.

290
00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:36.989
See. it was Guy Fawkes night.

291
00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:39.792
We could see the fireworks
off into the distance.

292
00:17:40.827 --> 00:17:41.994
Did I tell you we haven't

293
00:17:42.028 --> 00:17:43.530
got a fireworks
display around here?

294
00:17:43.596 --> 00:17:45.165
Just haven't got enough people.

295
00:17:45.165 --> 00:17:47.700
Anyway. we could see
it in Great Pitchfield

296
00:17:47.767 --> 00:17:49.302
about three miles away.

297
00:17:49.336 --> 00:17:50.470
I mean. it was a
really clear night

298
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.172
and I remember
because there was me.

299
00:17:52.172 --> 00:17:55.742
Billy. Drake. Bob.
Sandra. Ellen.

300
00:17:56.709 --> 00:17:58.445
Sally and Bernard.

301
00:17:58.511 --> 00:17:59.779
Yeah. Bernard.

302
00:17:59.779 --> 00:18:01.914
See now. Bernard was
trying to hump Sally

303
00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:03.750
all night long.
right in front of us.

304
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.218
We kept telling
him to leave it out

305
00:18:05.218 --> 00:18:07.987
but he just humped away to
his heart's content all night.

306
00:18:08.054 --> 00:18:10.490
In fact. I think he even
missed the fireworks.

307
00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:13.626
- Sorry. Bernard is?

308
00:18:13.626 --> 00:18:16.963
- Bernard's an afghan hound
and Sally's a shih tzu.

309
00:18:16.963 --> 00:18:18.831
Hang on. hang on.

310
00:18:18.865 --> 00:18:19.832
You thought they was?

311
00:18:19.832 --> 00:18:22.001
- Yeah. yeah. yeah.

312
00:18:22.001 --> 00:18:23.170
- No.

313
00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:25.138
Anyway. where was I?

314
00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:28.341
- Fireworks.

315
00:18:28.341 --> 00:18:29.842
- Oh yeah. yeah. the fireworks.

316
00:18:29.842 --> 00:18:32.179
Listen. Sandra and Bob were
looking out into the distance

317
00:18:32.179 --> 00:18:34.847
and to the left of the
fireworks. Bob could see

318
00:18:34.881 --> 00:18:36.849
this bright white light.

319
00:18:38.218 --> 00:18:39.786
Well he did point it out
to me. come to think of it.

320
00:18:39.819 --> 00:18:41.288
but I just dismissed it.

321
00:18:41.288 --> 00:18:42.955
I thought it was just.
you know. other fireworks.

322
00:18:42.989 --> 00:18:44.591
But anyway. listen.
all of a sudden

323
00:18:44.591 --> 00:18:46.058
there was a power surge.

324
00:18:46.092 --> 00:18:48.161
The whole village went
out and back on again.

325
00:18:48.161 --> 00:18:50.197
Well. Sally and
Bernard stopped humping

326
00:18:50.263 --> 00:18:51.464
and started howling.

327
00:18:51.464 --> 00:18:52.765
That made me look
across the field

328
00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:55.302
and there was this
bright white light.

329
00:18:55.302 --> 00:18:58.037
We could all see it. this one.

330
00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:02.242
and all of a sudden it
just and it was gone

331
00:19:02.242 --> 00:19:05.412
but in a completely different
direction to the fireworks.

332
00:19:07.714 --> 00:19:09.949
- You know. I mean. those lights

333
00:19:10.016 --> 00:19:12.084
could have been anything. right?

334
00:19:12.084 --> 00:19:13.386
- Yeah. maybe.

335
00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:14.887
Guess we'll never know now.

336
00:19:14.887 --> 00:19:17.890
(eerie tense music)

337
00:19:51.123 --> 00:19:55.962
(electrical crackling)
(screaming)

338
00:19:55.962 --> 00:19:57.297
Other strange things
happened that night.

339
00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.532
It was. everyone
had something stolen

340
00:19:59.599 --> 00:20:01.167
from properties. you know.

341
00:20:01.167 --> 00:20:02.369
I mean. Hanson reported it

342
00:20:02.402 --> 00:20:04.337
but everyone got
something stolen.

343
00:20:04.337 --> 00:20:08.174
Never did catch the bastards
that stole my scooter.

344
00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:09.609
- Uh. scooter?

345
00:20:09.676 --> 00:20:10.743
- Yeah. yeah you know.

346
00:20:11.678 --> 00:20:13.012
- Oh like a moped.

347
00:20:13.045 --> 00:20:14.247
Yeah.
- Oi. oi. oi.

348
00:20:14.247 --> 00:20:17.450
Don't ever call a
scooter a moped.

349
00:20:17.517 --> 00:20:18.951
I'll give you a slap next time.

350
00:20:18.951 --> 00:20:22.889
Anyway. there was one good
thing come out of that night.

351
00:20:22.922 --> 00:20:27.594
See. Sally had the
strangest puppies

352
00:20:27.594 --> 00:20:28.595
that you'd ever seen.

353
00:20:36.469 --> 00:20:37.870
- Puppies. right.

354
00:20:46.446 --> 00:20:49.048
- See. told you
this place was okay.

355
00:20:50.883 --> 00:20:51.651
- I guess.

356
00:20:54.921 --> 00:20:57.256
It's both a beautiful
and a really sad place.

357
00:20:58.257 --> 00:20:59.058
- Sad?

358
00:21:00.627 --> 00:21:02.795
- Looking at it
now. I can imagine

359
00:21:02.829 --> 00:21:04.297
what it once might have been

360
00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:09.536
but then all those years
of neglect and loneliness.

361
00:21:11.338 --> 00:21:13.840
It must have been amazing
when it was full of life.

362
00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:18.778
Now. it just looks
like my grandma.

363
00:21:18.845 --> 00:21:19.912
just hanging in there.

364
00:21:21.047 --> 00:21:22.549
- You do have a way with words.

365
00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:26.486
I could see you becoming
a great novelist one day.

366
00:21:28.721 --> 00:21:30.056
- Yeah?

367
00:21:30.089 --> 00:21:31.991
What sort of books
would I write?

368
00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:34.961
- Romantic ones for sure.

369
00:21:35.862 --> 00:21:37.029
- Really?

370
00:21:37.096 --> 00:21:39.332
You see me as a Mills
& Boons novelist?

371
00:21:39.332 --> 00:21:40.166
- Possibly.

372
00:21:41.468 --> 00:21:43.135
- Am I a graphic novelist?

373
00:21:44.203 --> 00:21:45.705
- I doubt that.

374
00:21:45.738 --> 00:21:48.908
I saw you when Catherine got
that nosebleed last year.

375
00:21:48.975 --> 00:21:50.910
You were hysterical.

376
00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:52.244
- You saw that?

377
00:21:52.278 --> 00:21:53.346
- Uh huh.

378
00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.548
She was bawling her eyes out.

379
00:21:55.548 --> 00:21:57.950
- And so the male brain
gets it wrong yet again.

380
00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:59.251
- Hmm?

381
00:21:59.251 --> 00:22:01.621
- I wasn't hysterical
because of the blood.

382
00:22:01.654 --> 00:22:04.123
I was upset for my friend.

383
00:22:04.123 --> 00:22:06.593
She had a date that
night and she got blood

384
00:22:06.593 --> 00:22:07.594
all down her blouse.

385
00:22:08.795 --> 00:22:10.497
It was the one she was
gonna wear on the date.

386
00:22:11.798 --> 00:22:13.600
- I see. okay. so.

387
00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.702
It could be graphic novels.

388
00:22:17.303 --> 00:22:19.806
All I know is you've
got a pretty mind.

389
00:22:21.674 --> 00:22:22.675
- Pretty mind?

390
00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:25.912
That could almost be
considered flirting.

391
00:22:28.014 --> 00:22:29.582
- Men don't flirt.

392
00:22:29.582 --> 00:22:33.453
- No. they don't. I agree.

393
00:22:33.486 --> 00:22:35.555
They make it too obvious.

394
00:22:37.289 --> 00:22:38.791
I know exactly why
you've brought me here

395
00:22:38.825 --> 00:22:39.726
and what you want.

396
00:22:40.993 --> 00:22:42.795
- And why is that?

397
00:22:42.795 --> 00:22:44.497
- The question isn't why.

398
00:22:44.531 --> 00:22:46.866
The question is answered
just by my being here.

399
00:22:49.368 --> 00:22:52.204
(woman screaming in distance)

400
00:22:52.238 --> 00:22:53.740
What was that?

401
00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.742
- Yeah. I heard that.

402
00:22:55.742 --> 00:22:57.109
- Listen.

403
00:22:57.176 --> 00:22:58.210
(woman sobbing)

404
00:22:58.210 --> 00:22:59.846
- Sounds like crying.

405
00:22:59.879 --> 00:23:02.281
Like a woman crying.

406
00:23:02.281 --> 00:23:04.083
- We should leave.

407
00:23:04.083 --> 00:23:07.720
- No. I want to
see what that is.

408
00:23:07.754 --> 00:23:10.757
(eerie tense music)

409
00:23:16.629 --> 00:23:18.130
- I don't like this.

410
00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:21.133
(ethereal roaring)

411
00:23:21.133 --> 00:23:23.970
That sounded like death itself.

412
00:23:24.003 --> 00:23:27.306
- Whatever it is it sounds
weird and pissed off.

413
00:23:27.339 --> 00:23:29.241
- I think we should leave.

414
00:23:29.241 --> 00:23:32.078
- No. I need to
know what that is.

415
00:23:34.046 --> 00:23:36.916
(ethereal roaring)

416
00:23:38.951 --> 00:23:40.086
- What is it?

417
00:23:40.086 --> 00:23:41.320
- Don't come up here.

418
00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:45.257
- What is it?

419
00:23:45.257 --> 00:23:48.260
(eerie tense music)

420
00:23:51.664 --> 00:23:54.534
(ethereal roaring)

421
00:23:57.504 --> 00:23:58.304
Dan?

422
00:24:00.006 --> 00:24:00.807
Dan.

423
00:24:03.009 --> 00:24:04.010
Dan!

424
00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:05.512
- What?

425
00:24:05.545 --> 00:24:07.780
- Something is watching us.

426
00:24:08.915 --> 00:24:11.918
(eerie tense music)

427
00:24:12.885 --> 00:24:14.887
(wet crunching)

428
00:24:14.921 --> 00:24:15.955
What is that?

429
00:24:17.089 --> 00:24:18.257
- [Dan] I have no idea.

430
00:24:19.792 --> 00:24:20.627
- What do we do?

431
00:24:24.631 --> 00:24:26.933
- Run.

432
00:24:26.966 --> 00:24:27.800
Run.

433
00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:30.336
Run!

434
00:24:30.336 --> 00:24:34.173
(energetic eerie tense music)

435
00:24:42.949 --> 00:24:47.954
(wet crunching)
(Dan screaming)

436
00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.089
(gasps)

437
00:24:52.759 --> 00:24:55.762
(eerie tense music)

438
00:25:02.501 --> 00:25:03.670
- Bloody kids.

439
00:25:33.465 --> 00:25:34.934
(alarm ringing)

440
00:25:34.934 --> 00:25:35.735
- Fuck.

441
00:25:40.873 --> 00:25:43.375
(tense music)

442
00:25:58.124 --> 00:26:00.459
- So what we got here. then?

443
00:26:02.294 --> 00:26:04.163
- I can't believe you've
never heard of the film Jaws.

444
00:26:04.163 --> 00:26:06.465
It was a Spielberg masterpiece.

445
00:26:06.465 --> 00:26:08.835
Do you know it took 159
days to make that film

446
00:26:08.868 --> 00:26:10.903
'cause the shark
just wouldn't work.

447
00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:12.639
What films you into. anyway?

448
00:26:12.672 --> 00:26:15.541
- [Radio] Calling PS Cooper.
PS Cooper. are you there?

449
00:26:15.541 --> 00:26:16.709
- Yeah. receiving. over.

450
00:26:16.743 --> 00:26:17.677
- [Radio] Breaking
and entering reported

451
00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:19.211
at Little Pitchfield Manor.

452
00:26:19.211 --> 00:26:21.714
Suspects on site.
I see one male.

453
00:26:21.714 --> 00:26:22.715
and I see one female.

454
00:26:22.749 --> 00:26:25.284
Also reports of IC9 in location.

455
00:26:25.317 --> 00:26:27.253
- Yeah. on route.

456
00:26:27.253 --> 00:26:28.254
What's on IC9?

457
00:26:28.254 --> 00:26:29.255
- IC9 is unknown.

458
00:26:29.288 --> 00:26:30.489
- Oh right.

459
00:26:30.556 --> 00:26:31.457
- Where's Little
Pitchfield Manor?

460
00:26:31.457 --> 00:26:32.158
- Just 'round the corner.

461
00:26:32.224 --> 00:26:32.959
- There?
- Yeah.

462
00:26:32.959 --> 00:26:33.793
- Come on.

463
00:26:35.294 --> 00:26:40.299
(alarm ringing)
(tense music)

464
00:26:44.336 --> 00:26:46.372
- Oi. what are you doing?

465
00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.575
- I'm going in.

466
00:26:49.575 --> 00:26:51.010
- No. hang on.

467
00:26:51.043 --> 00:26:54.213
I've got to get my
breath back. first.

468
00:26:56.916 --> 00:26:59.085
- Are we going in or not?

469
00:26:59.118 --> 00:27:00.486
- Hang on.

470
00:27:00.552 --> 00:27:04.056
Jesus. you scared
the shit out of me.

471
00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:05.324
- I just got here.

472
00:27:05.324 --> 00:27:06.826
Got scared. didn't
want to go inside

473
00:27:06.859 --> 00:27:08.761
in case there are
dangerous criminals.

474
00:27:09.662 --> 00:27:11.297
- (mumbles) 'round here.

475
00:27:11.297 --> 00:27:15.334
Anyway. you would of scared
them all away. Ellen.

476
00:27:17.236 --> 00:27:20.639
(tense electronic music)

477
00:27:25.945 --> 00:27:27.279
- It should be okay. now.

478
00:27:27.279 --> 00:27:29.581
Bob has them cornered
in the library.

479
00:27:29.581 --> 00:27:30.582
Come on.

480
00:27:42.128 --> 00:27:43.529
- Hang on.

(alarm ringing)
(tense electronic music)

482
00:27:53.672 --> 00:27:55.341
- Where'd you say they was?

483
00:27:55.341 --> 00:27:56.408
- Library.

484
00:27:56.475 --> 00:27:57.576
- Excuse me. sorry.

485
00:27:57.576 --> 00:27:59.011
Madam. thank you.

486
00:28:10.422 --> 00:28:11.657
- I've got 'em.

487
00:28:11.724 --> 00:28:13.525
I've kept them safe.

488
00:28:13.525 --> 00:28:14.994
They're not gonna go anywhere.

489
00:28:14.994 --> 00:28:16.262
You can count on me.

490
00:28:17.163 --> 00:28:18.530
You can always count on me.

491
00:28:18.597 --> 00:28:20.099
- Nice work. Bob.

492
00:28:20.099 --> 00:28:21.333
- Sir. if you could just put
that weapon down for me. sir.

493
00:28:21.333 --> 00:28:22.334
- Shaun. Shaun.
- Sir. sir.

494
00:28:22.334 --> 00:28:24.136
- It's all right. it's okay.

495
00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:26.005
- I think it's outrageous that
you come onto my property.

496
00:28:26.005 --> 00:28:29.008
- I'll take it from here. Ellen.

497
00:28:31.243 --> 00:28:33.679
Now. I don't recognise yous two.

498
00:28:33.712 --> 00:28:34.613

00:28:34.613 --> 00:28:35.848
- I'm Dan. this is Katie.

500
00:28:35.882 --> 00:28:37.784
- Ah Great Pitchfield

501
00:28:37.784 --> 00:28:39.285

502
00:28:39.285 --> 00:28:42.054
- Yeah. look like a couple
of wrongens to me. as well.

503
00:28:42.088 --> 00:28:42.922
- [Dan] Did you see it?

504
00:28:42.922 --> 00:28:43.823
- See what?

505
00:28:43.823 --> 00:28:44.957
- The thing in the woods.

506
00:28:44.957 --> 00:28:45.958
- It was chasing us.

507
00:28:47.193 --> 00:28:49.328
- Oh. funny.

508
00:28:49.328 --> 00:28:50.596
Very funny.

509
00:28:50.629 --> 00:28:52.765
Bob is this. Ellen did
you put him up to this?

510
00:28:52.765 --> 00:28:54.600
Is this someones
birthday or something?

511
00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.402
- This deadly serious.

512
00:28:56.402 --> 00:28:58.070
- This is fucking serious.

513
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:59.171
- Excuse me. sir.

514
00:28:59.171 --> 00:29:00.539
Have you or Katie found yourself

515
00:29:00.572 --> 00:29:03.075
taking any illegal
substances today?

516
00:29:03.142 --> 00:29:04.043
- [Dan] No.

517
00:29:04.043 --> 00:29:04.844
- Have you checked the grounds?

518
00:29:04.877 --> 00:29:05.778
It was chasing it.

519
00:29:05.778 --> 00:29:07.279
It attacked Dan.

520
00:29:07.279 --> 00:29:09.715
- This is pathetic.

521
00:29:09.715 --> 00:29:11.117
What attacked you?

522
00:29:11.183 --> 00:29:12.284
- Some thing.

523
00:29:12.284 --> 00:29:13.452
We heard it.

524
00:29:13.485 --> 00:29:15.087
Yeah. we were on the
grounds. we admit that.

525
00:29:16.088 --> 00:29:17.924
We heard a noise in the woods.

526
00:29:17.924 --> 00:29:19.258
we went to investigate it.

527
00:29:19.258 --> 00:29:20.492
- Oh. you don't do that.

528
00:29:20.526 --> 00:29:21.760
- [Dan] What?

529
00:29:21.794 --> 00:29:23.029
- Well. if you've ever
seen any horror film

530
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:26.498
you know you never
ever investigate.

531
00:29:26.498 --> 00:29:30.803
You get our ass cheeks out
there as soon as possible.

532
00:29:30.837 --> 00:29:32.171
- I agree with Bob.

533
00:29:32.171 --> 00:29:34.340
- Can we please
stick to the facts?

534
00:29:35.474 --> 00:29:36.542
Tell me what happened.

535
00:29:37.443 --> 00:29:40.947
- Uh. well it was.

536
00:29:42.348 --> 00:29:45.184
it was. it was like.

537
00:29:46.085 --> 00:29:47.386
It was like.

538
00:29:48.287 --> 00:29:49.588
- You need to tell them.

539
00:29:49.588 --> 00:29:50.957
- They won't believe us.

540
00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:52.558
- Try us.

541
00:29:52.591 --> 00:29:53.759
- Okay.

542
00:29:55.294 --> 00:29:56.462
It looked like a zombie.

543
00:29:58.865 --> 00:30:01.000
- Oh that wee Billy.

544
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.668
- Probably.

545
00:30:02.668 --> 00:30:05.171
- I think. I think what
they're referring to

546
00:30:05.171 --> 00:30:08.007
is the IC9 reported
to be in the vicinity.

547
00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.376
- IC9. is that police
code for zombie?

548
00:30:10.376 --> 00:30:11.510
- No.

549
00:30:11.543 --> 00:30:13.079
It means unknown.

550
00:30:13.079 --> 00:30:15.781
- What I think this is. sir.

551
00:30:15.848 --> 00:30:18.350
is a clearly a case
of mistaken identity.

552
00:30:18.384 --> 00:30:20.286
- We were chased by this thing.

553
00:30:20.286 --> 00:30:21.787
- Are you in charge here?

554
00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:23.322
- [Cooper] And what makes
you say that. little lady?

555
00:30:23.389 --> 00:30:24.823
- You are Police
Sergeant Cooper.

556
00:30:24.823 --> 00:30:26.125
- Oh. you've heard
of me. have you?

557
00:30:26.125 --> 00:30:28.260
- Yeah. my uncle works
in traffic police

558
00:30:28.294 --> 00:30:30.796
and we've heard of you and
this shitty little hamlet.

559
00:30:30.796 --> 00:30:33.099
In Great Pitchfield.
you were voted

560
00:30:33.099 --> 00:30:35.667
the most incompetent sergeant
in the whole district.

561
00:30:37.703 --> 00:30:39.005
- Go that far?

562
00:30:39.005 --> 00:30:40.672
- You need to know
what we understand

563
00:30:40.672 --> 00:30:42.174
what we witnessed here.

564
00:30:42.174 --> 00:30:43.409
- I think you need to
tell us what is going on.

565
00:30:43.475 --> 00:30:45.711
You need to describe
the individual for us.

566
00:30:45.711 --> 00:30:49.115
- Person. they were lying down.

567
00:30:49.181 --> 00:30:51.350
Put it this way. all
their insides. yeah.

568
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:52.818
they were on the outside.

569
00:30:52.885 --> 00:30:55.821
- Right. you've described
that person as a person.

570
00:30:55.821 --> 00:30:57.756
why not a man or a woman?

571
00:30:57.756 --> 00:30:59.558
- 'Cause it was so mutilated.

572
00:30:59.591 --> 00:31:01.260
I couldn't tell. all right.

573
00:31:06.165 --> 00:31:07.333
- I think we need to
do a perimeter search

574
00:31:07.366 --> 00:31:09.535
and I think we
need to do one now.

575
00:31:09.568 --> 00:31:11.837
- Yeah. I think you're right.

576
00:31:11.837 --> 00:31:13.405
- [Katie] Do you
have any weapons?

577
00:31:13.472 --> 00:31:14.673
- No. we don't carry firearms.

578
00:31:14.673 --> 00:31:16.708
That's a specialist unit does.

579
00:31:16.742 --> 00:31:18.177
- I got weapons.

580
00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:20.846
- You're not really listening
to this drivel. are you?

581
00:31:25.884 --> 00:31:27.486
- So.

582
00:31:27.486 --> 00:31:30.456
- (whispering)

583
00:31:30.456 --> 00:31:33.225
- [Bob] So. what
was the award for?

584
00:31:33.259 --> 00:31:34.460
- What?

585
00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:35.627
- [Bob] Well. the
most incompetent

586
00:31:35.661 --> 00:31:38.030
police sergeant in the district.

587
00:31:38.097 --> 00:31:41.100
(eerie tense music)

588
00:31:42.634 --> 00:31:44.836
(growling)

589
00:31:53.745 --> 00:31:55.247
(gasps)

590
00:31:55.281 --> 00:31:56.782
- What's wrong?

591
00:31:56.848 --> 00:31:59.418
- Whatever it is.
I've just seen it.

592
00:32:00.953 --> 00:32:01.653
- Where?

593
00:32:02.621 --> 00:32:05.457
- It was just staring at me.

594
00:32:05.457 --> 00:32:07.193
Evil eyes.

595
00:32:07.259 --> 00:32:09.595
(eerie tense music)

596
00:32:09.595 --> 00:32:10.929
- Do you need them weapons?

597
00:32:11.797 --> 00:32:13.832
- Weapons.

598
00:32:13.832 --> 00:32:15.034
Yous all stay here.

599
00:32:15.101 --> 00:32:16.969
Bob. we'll talk about
those weapon later.

600
00:32:17.003 --> 00:32:19.305
- I've got tonnes of
them in the greenhouse.

601
00:32:19.305 --> 00:32:22.308
(eerie tense music)

602
00:32:24.343 --> 00:32:27.213
(ethereal roaring)

603
00:32:39.425 --> 00:32:41.660
(coughing)

604
00:32:45.131 --> 00:32:48.034
(ethereal roaring)

605
00:32:49.301 --> 00:32:52.304
(eerie tense music)

606
00:33:20.132 --> 00:33:23.035
(ethereal roaring)

607
00:33:42.954 --> 00:33:44.823
(shouts)

608
00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:46.092
Did you lose it?

609
00:33:46.092 --> 00:33:46.992
- There are no weapons.

610
00:33:47.059 --> 00:33:49.528
- What do they look like then?

611
00:33:52.631 --> 00:33:53.532
- Run. run.

612
00:33:55.334 --> 00:33:58.337
(eerie tense music)

613
00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:02.741
- Brody. wait!

614
00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:05.544
Wait.

615
00:34:13.919 --> 00:34:15.154
- Come on!

616
00:34:15.154 --> 00:34:16.322
- Wait for me.

617
00:34:19.558 --> 00:34:22.461
(ethereal roaring)

618
00:34:29.835 --> 00:34:32.838
(eerie tense music)

619
00:34:56.962 --> 00:34:58.330
Shit. go. go. go.

620
00:35:28.794 --> 00:35:30.996
(shouting)

621
00:35:31.029 --> 00:35:32.030
Quick. help us.

622
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:32.864
We've got people here.

623
00:35:32.864 --> 00:35:33.699
- What?

624
00:35:37.369 --> 00:35:38.537
- Get it up.

625
00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:40.071
What happened here?

626
00:35:40.071 --> 00:35:41.907
No. put your end down.

627
00:35:44.376 --> 00:35:47.213
(groaning)

628
00:35:47.246 --> 00:35:50.249
(eerie tense music)

629
00:35:55.086 --> 00:35:56.422
(groaning)

630
00:35:56.422 --> 00:35:57.923
- [Brody] Push it.

631
00:36:00.759 --> 00:36:01.660
Some chairs. some chairs.

632
00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:03.529
- Okay. I'll block it up.

633
00:36:16.675 --> 00:36:21.680
(ethereal growling)
(gunshot)

634
00:36:24.383 --> 00:36:27.118
- Man. you said.
you said nothing

635
00:36:27.118 --> 00:36:29.555
ever happens here. normally.

636
00:36:30.922 --> 00:36:31.823
- It don't.

637
00:36:33.259 --> 00:36:34.760
That's not normal.

638
00:36:37.996 --> 00:36:41.333
Apart from that runaway
a couple of days ago.

639
00:36:44.169 --> 00:36:45.871
- What runaway?

640
00:36:45.871 --> 00:36:49.375
(ethereal growling)
(screaming)

641
00:36:49.408 --> 00:36:52.411
(eerie tense music)

642
00:37:17.669 --> 00:37:19.538
Hello. is anyone there?

643
00:37:19.571 --> 00:37:20.406
This is PC Brody.

644
00:37:22.574 --> 00:37:27.279
We need immediate backup
at Little Pitchfield Manor.

645
00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:39.591
- How many were there?

646
00:37:42.461 --> 00:37:43.329
- Dozens of em.

647
00:37:44.463 --> 00:37:46.197
They just kept
coming out the woods.

648
00:37:54.005 --> 00:37:55.807
- What do you think it is?

649
00:37:56.675 --> 00:37:57.509
- Zombies?

650
00:37:58.544 --> 00:37:59.545
- I knew it.

651
00:38:00.912 --> 00:38:04.516
- Our barricade's not
gonna hold them for long.

652
00:38:05.451 --> 00:38:06.284
- Jesus.

653
00:38:09.455 --> 00:38:11.390
Joe. do you hear me?

654
00:38:14.125 --> 00:38:15.160
It's Shaun Cooper.

655
00:38:16.462 --> 00:38:17.363
We're at the old manor house.

656
00:38:17.363 --> 00:38:18.930
Look. we need backup now.

657
00:38:18.964 --> 00:38:22.334
There's just dozens of
them. like creatures.

658
00:38:22.334 --> 00:38:23.168
- IC9s.

659
00:38:24.135 --> 00:38:26.304
- IC9s. do you hear me. over.

660
00:38:27.673 --> 00:38:31.009
- Well. what do we do now?

661
00:38:31.009 --> 00:38:34.179
- We hold them off and
we wait for backup.

662
00:38:34.212 --> 00:38:35.246
Yeah?

663
00:38:35.246 --> 00:38:36.582
- Look. I agree.

664
00:38:38.216 --> 00:38:41.219
(eerie tense music)

665
00:38:57.503 --> 00:38:59.505
(farts)

666
00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:03.341
- Better out than in.

667
00:39:03.341 --> 00:39:04.776
- Oh please.

668
00:39:04.843 --> 00:39:08.847
- I'm sorry. I just get
nervous in these situations.

669
00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:09.781
- [Ellen] We're all nervous.

670
00:39:09.781 --> 00:39:11.417
Just try to control yourself.

671
00:39:11.417 --> 00:39:13.885
- Hey. it looks
like they're gone.

672
00:39:13.919 --> 00:39:15.153
- No. no I don't care.

673
00:39:15.153 --> 00:39:16.655
Okay. we stay here
where we are safe

674
00:39:16.655 --> 00:39:17.989
and we wait for them
to come and get us.

675
00:39:18.056 --> 00:39:20.091
- So your whole plan is
to sit and do nothing?

676
00:39:20.091 --> 00:39:22.093
- Well it sounds like
a great plan to me.

677
00:39:22.127 --> 00:39:24.162
- It's been two
hours and nothing.

678
00:39:24.195 --> 00:39:26.031
- Calm down.

679
00:39:26.031 --> 00:39:28.166
- It's gotta be some
sort of chemical attack.

680
00:39:28.166 --> 00:39:29.100
it's got to be.

681
00:39:29.134 --> 00:39:29.901
- If it was a chemical attack.

682
00:39:29.901 --> 00:39:31.369
why aren't we infected?

683
00:39:31.369 --> 00:39:33.038
- What do you think?

684
00:39:34.305 --> 00:39:35.140
- I don't know.

685
00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:36.475
Like I said. zombies.

686
00:39:36.508 --> 00:39:38.844
- No. no about getting
someone here to help.

687
00:39:38.877 --> 00:39:39.878
Okay. someone has to
go and find a phone.

688
00:39:39.878 --> 00:39:41.079
- No.

689
00:39:41.079 --> 00:39:43.449
- Bob. do you have
a landline here?

690
00:39:43.515 --> 00:39:46.418
- In my room but that's over
the other side of the manor.

691
00:39:46.418 --> 00:39:47.586
- I'll go.

692
00:39:47.619 --> 00:39:48.820
- [Katie] No. they could
still be out there.

693
00:39:48.887 --> 00:39:51.156
- Well look. we
can't risk it okay.

694
00:39:51.156 --> 00:39:52.658
- I was my college record holder

695
00:39:52.658 --> 00:39:53.725
over 100 metre sprint.

696
00:39:53.759 --> 00:39:55.927
I will be in and out.

697
00:39:55.961 --> 00:39:57.295
I know where it is.

698
00:39:57.295 --> 00:39:58.430
- Don't go.

699
00:39:58.464 --> 00:39:59.465
Stay here.

700
00:39:59.465 --> 00:40:00.799
- Dan. Dan. Dan.

701
00:40:01.967 --> 00:40:03.201
Come back through
the barricade. okay.

702
00:40:03.201 --> 00:40:04.002
It's not safe out there.
- I will be two minutes.

703
00:40:04.002 --> 00:40:05.003
I'll be right back.

704
00:40:05.871 --> 00:40:07.539
- Fuck's sake.

705
00:40:07.539 --> 00:40:10.942
(tense electronic music)

706
00:40:18.083 --> 00:40:21.086
(ethereal growling)

707
00:40:22.954 --> 00:40:25.457
(tense electronic music)

708
00:40:25.457 --> 00:40:28.359
(ethereal roaring)

709
00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:37.202
(screeching)

710
00:40:52.383 --> 00:40:55.253
(ethereal roaring)

711
00:41:04.129 --> 00:41:07.533
(tense electronic music)

712
00:41:16.675 --> 00:41:18.877
(shouting)

713
00:41:21.212 --> 00:41:23.549
(screaming)

714
00:41:27.452 --> 00:41:32.457
(ethereal roaring)
(wet guttural screaming)

715
00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:51.610
(low tense music)

716
00:42:09.861 --> 00:42:13.331
- Well. at least the
power's still on.

717
00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:17.202
- Think they're still out there?

718
00:42:17.235 --> 00:42:19.738
- Of course they're
still out there.

719
00:42:19.805 --> 00:42:21.139
You should have stopped him.

720
00:42:21.172 --> 00:42:22.340
You should have made him stay.

721
00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:24.009
- It's not within our
remit to use force

722
00:42:24.009 --> 00:42:25.510
or aggression to
control a situation.

723
00:42:25.543 --> 00:42:27.212
Okay. we deescalate.

724
00:42:27.212 --> 00:42:28.546
- Deescalate.
- Yeah.

725
00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:30.749
- PC Brody was
only doing his job.

726
00:42:30.782 --> 00:42:32.217
- You shut up.

727
00:42:32.217 --> 00:42:33.985
You wanted to press
charges and now he's dead.

728
00:42:34.052 --> 00:42:35.921
- Why don't you all shut up?

729
00:42:35.921 --> 00:42:38.256
- It's the end of the world!

730
00:42:39.457 --> 00:42:40.558
I've seen it.

731
00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:45.597
I've seen it for
nigh on 30 years.

732
00:42:45.597 --> 00:42:49.400
In my dreams and
nightmares. this is it.

733
00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:54.072
- What are you talking about?

734
00:42:54.072 --> 00:42:58.944
- I'm telling you straight.
I've seen it before. in visions.

735
00:43:02.614 --> 00:43:05.416
Nigh. it is out there.

736
00:43:06.384 --> 00:43:08.720
Nigh. it is waiting.

737
00:43:10.288 --> 00:43:11.122
- [Ellen] Who?

738
00:43:12.891 --> 00:43:13.725
- Them.

739
00:43:15.126 --> 00:43:16.928
- So not zombies then?

740
00:43:16.962 --> 00:43:20.766
- Zombies is like a
picnic compared to this.

741
00:43:23.669 --> 00:43:26.304
17 years ago. do you remember?

742
00:43:26.304 --> 00:43:31.242
17 years ago they came
a-looking. stalking

743
00:43:32.878 --> 00:43:35.346
like burglars looking
'round a house

744
00:43:35.346 --> 00:43:36.915
they're gonna raid.

745
00:43:37.849 --> 00:43:39.284
- He's right.

746
00:43:39.284 --> 00:43:42.287
- This aint no zombies.

747
00:43:44.756 --> 00:43:46.424
This aint gonna end.

748
00:43:48.794 --> 00:43:52.597
Nobody's coming to save us.

749
00:43:52.597 --> 00:43:54.866
We have to save ourselves.

750
00:43:56.902 --> 00:43:58.536
- He's right.

751
00:43:58.536 --> 00:44:00.205
It's aliens!

752
00:44:00.238 --> 00:44:01.406
- [Ellen] How can
you be so excited?

753
00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:03.975
- 'Cause for once in my life

754
00:44:04.009 --> 00:44:05.543
I get to be Sigourney Weaver.

755
00:44:06.945 --> 00:44:10.081
Look. I might just have a way
of getting us out of this.

756
00:44:10.081 --> 00:44:11.116
- [Brody] Okay. so
what's the plan then?

757
00:44:11.182 --> 00:44:13.618
- Weapons. bloody loads of them.

758
00:44:13.618 --> 00:44:15.821
Bob. where are those weapons?

759
00:44:15.887 --> 00:44:18.724
(low eerie music)

760
00:44:20.425 --> 00:44:21.760
Bob. Bob wait wait.

761
00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:22.794
- What?

762
00:44:22.828 --> 00:44:24.629
- Give me the weapon.

763
00:44:24.629 --> 00:44:25.931
- It's mine.

764
00:44:25.964 --> 00:44:27.132
- Now. I don't like
this as much as you do

765
00:44:27.132 --> 00:44:29.735
but give me the weapon.

766
00:44:29.801 --> 00:44:31.903
Now stay behind me.

767
00:44:31.903 --> 00:44:33.171
Not that close.

768
00:44:41.379 --> 00:44:43.014
Absolute silence.

769
00:44:43.048 --> 00:44:44.282
- That be good.

770
00:44:51.556 --> 00:44:54.525
(eerie tense music)

771
00:45:35.433 --> 00:45:37.903
(eerie music)

772
00:45:51.382 --> 00:45:53.484
- Where are those weapons. Bob?

773
00:45:53.484 --> 00:45:57.655
- In the greenhouse.
out by the allotment.

774
00:45:57.655 --> 00:45:58.489
- Come on.

775
00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:02.293
(eerie tense music)

776
00:46:06.798 --> 00:46:10.001
(electrical crackling)

777
00:46:35.927 --> 00:46:37.095
- There it be.

778
00:46:37.128 --> 00:46:38.129
- Wait. wait. wait.

779
00:46:38.129 --> 00:46:40.498
Is that one of the creatures?

780
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.668
- He looks buggered.

781
00:46:43.668 --> 00:46:45.036
- No. they don't.

782
00:46:47.172 --> 00:46:49.007
- Are we gonna go or what?

783
00:46:49.007 --> 00:46:50.475
- Oh come on. Bob.

784
00:46:50.475 --> 00:46:51.843
We've all seen
enough of them films

785
00:46:51.843 --> 00:46:53.378
to know it's not dead.

786
00:46:53.411 --> 00:46:55.213
It's just laying there
waiting for us to approach

787
00:46:55.213 --> 00:46:57.015
and when we do it will be alive.

788
00:46:58.383 --> 00:47:01.552
- I'll bash it with this.

789
00:47:01.586 --> 00:47:02.587
- That won't work.

790
00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:04.890
It will still be alive.

791
00:47:04.923 --> 00:47:08.126
(eerie tense music)

792
00:47:08.126 --> 00:47:09.294
- Are you gonna
make a decision soon

793
00:47:09.327 --> 00:47:10.328
or others will come.

794
00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:14.966
- All right. come
on. let's do it.

795
00:47:24.175 --> 00:47:26.377
(growling)

796
00:47:30.715 --> 00:47:31.883
- There it be.

797
00:47:39.457 --> 00:47:40.625
- Thundercats!

798
00:47:41.692 --> 00:47:44.695
(eerie tense music)

799
00:47:56.407 --> 00:47:58.376
- That's Billy.

800
00:47:58.376 --> 00:47:59.577
- Can't be.

801
00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:00.912
We only seen him
a few hours ago.

802
00:48:00.912 --> 00:48:02.847
- That's definitely him.

803
00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:04.882
- That means whatever's
infected them

804
00:48:04.882 --> 00:48:07.218
is killing them in
just a couple of hours.

805
00:48:07.252 --> 00:48:09.087
(ethereal roaring)

806
00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:10.922
(gunshot)

807
00:48:10.922 --> 00:48:12.323
- Thank you.

808
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:15.360
(eerie tense music)

809
00:48:18.663 --> 00:48:21.599
(ethereal roaring)

810
00:49:14.052 --> 00:49:15.720
- It's them.

811
00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:17.155
They're coming for us now.

812
00:49:17.155 --> 00:49:18.723
- It's okay. it's okay.

813
00:49:18.756 --> 00:49:19.657
It's gonna be fine.

814
00:49:19.657 --> 00:49:22.027
It's gonna be absolutely fine.

815
00:49:23.761 --> 00:49:25.430
Oi. Katie. what are you doing?

816
00:49:26.464 --> 00:49:27.832
- I can get out.

817
00:49:27.832 --> 00:49:29.534
They're distracted
with those two.

818
00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:30.501
I can get out.

819
00:49:30.501 --> 00:49:32.837
- No. no. just. uh. don't move.

820
00:49:32.837 --> 00:49:34.672
- You didn't stop Dan.

821
00:49:34.672 --> 00:49:35.740
Why would you stop me?

822
00:49:36.707 --> 00:49:39.610
- [Brody] Katie!

823
00:49:39.677 --> 00:49:44.015
Fuck's sake.

824
00:49:44.049 --> 00:49:47.052
(eerie tense music)

825
00:49:52.757 --> 00:49:57.762
(ethereal roaring)
(eerie tense music)

826
00:50:13.544 --> 00:50:15.880
(screaming)

827
00:50:17.182 --> 00:50:19.684
(tense music)

828
00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:30.761
- What's wrong?

829
00:50:30.761 --> 00:50:32.530
- It's my leg. it really hurts.

830
00:50:32.530 --> 00:50:34.265
- Is it where Billy grabbed ya?

831
00:50:34.299 --> 00:50:38.203
- No. no I scarped it on
an old tree stump just now.

832
00:50:38.203 --> 00:50:40.371
- Tell me the truth. Bob.

833
00:50:41.639 --> 00:50:43.541
- Nothing happened.

834
00:50:44.942 --> 00:50:46.444
- No it's not.

835
00:50:46.511 --> 00:50:47.612
It's where Billy. that
creature. grabbed you

836
00:50:47.612 --> 00:50:49.380
and now you're infected.

837
00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:50.615
You're gonna turn into
one of them monsters.

838
00:50:50.681 --> 00:50:53.551
- It was just an old
tree stump. I tell ya.

839
00:50:53.551 --> 00:50:54.385
- You're lying!

840
00:50:56.087 --> 00:50:57.388
- [Bob] You don't believe me?

841
00:50:57.388 --> 00:50:58.589
- If you turn into
one of them things

842
00:50:58.589 --> 00:50:59.990
I'll blow your
bleeding head off.

843
00:51:00.057 --> 00:51:02.427
- [Bob] I'm telling you
the truth. believe me.

844
00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:05.463
(eerie tense music)

845
00:51:06.297 --> 00:51:07.632
- Okay. come on.

846
00:51:11.336 --> 00:51:14.339
(eerie tense music)

847
00:51:42.333 --> 00:51:44.502
(ethereal roaring)

848
00:51:44.535 --> 00:51:46.671
(gunshot)

849
00:51:52.343 --> 00:51:53.344
Brody. Brody!

850
00:51:54.279 --> 00:51:55.079
Brody.

851
00:51:56.247 --> 00:51:57.081
Brody!

852
00:51:57.081 --> 00:51:58.349
- Oh. shit.

853
00:51:58.383 --> 00:52:00.951
- [Cooper] Here. take this.

854
00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:03.321
(tense music)

855
00:52:18.303 --> 00:52:20.505
- We thought you were dead.

856
00:52:28.446 --> 00:52:31.048
- Wait. where's Katie?

857
00:52:31.048 --> 00:52:33.384
- It's nothing.
- She's gone.

858
00:52:33.384 --> 00:52:34.385
I couldn't stop her.

859
00:52:37.822 --> 00:52:38.823
What's happened?

860
00:52:38.889 --> 00:52:40.658
- There's dozens of em.

861
00:52:40.658 --> 00:52:43.027
Look. I need to speak to you.

862
00:52:45.162 --> 00:52:47.765
One of them creatures was Billy.

863
00:52:47.798 --> 00:52:48.933
- Billy?

864
00:52:48.933 --> 00:52:50.201
Pissed up the tree Billy?

865
00:52:50.201 --> 00:52:51.035
- Yeah.

866
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:55.072
That means this must be a virus

867
00:52:55.139 --> 00:52:58.142
and I'm guessing it's passed
on by physical contact.

868
00:52:58.175 --> 00:53:00.110
- Does that mean
it could actually

869
00:53:00.110 --> 00:53:01.779
be a chemical weapon's attack?

870
00:53:01.846 --> 00:53:03.848
- No. not in Little Pitchfield.

871
00:53:03.881 --> 00:53:05.750
Anyway. it's not airborne.

872
00:53:06.917 --> 00:53:09.454
- All right. what
weapons did we get?

873
00:53:09.487 --> 00:53:11.121
- Let's do our weapon's check.

874
00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:18.263
(eerie tense music)

875
00:53:44.322 --> 00:53:45.923
Have you had any
weapons training?

876
00:53:45.923 --> 00:53:47.057
- Oh yeah.

877
00:53:47.091 --> 00:53:48.593
We had a weeks intensive
combat training.

878
00:53:48.593 --> 00:53:52.797
Trust me. I know my
way a few of these.

879
00:53:52.797 --> 00:53:53.931
- How is he?

880
00:53:53.964 --> 00:53:55.466
- We need a doctor.

881
00:53:55.466 --> 00:53:57.001
- What now?

882
00:53:57.001 --> 00:53:59.670
Come here. I need to talk to ya.

883
00:54:01.071 --> 00:54:04.074
You know I said one of
them creatures was Billy?

884
00:54:04.141 --> 00:54:06.043
We see him less
than 24 hours ago.

885
00:54:08.546 --> 00:54:11.416
Yeah. well he was half
dead before I killed him.

886
00:54:11.416 --> 00:54:13.083
This could only mean one thing.

887
00:54:13.117 --> 00:54:14.619
- What?

888
00:54:14.619 --> 00:54:16.487
- This aint just a virus.

889
00:54:16.554 --> 00:54:18.155
It's an annihilation.

890
00:54:18.155 --> 00:54:19.390
We're being exterminated.

891
00:54:20.558 --> 00:54:23.528
(ethereal growling)

892
00:54:24.462 --> 00:54:25.296
You promised me!

893
00:54:27.298 --> 00:54:29.033
- I lied.

894
00:54:29.099 --> 00:54:34.071
(ethereal roaring)
(gunfire)

895
00:54:41.078 --> 00:54:44.682
- Look. once you kill
'em. no more virus.

896
00:54:44.715 --> 00:54:47.418
- No. what does that.
what does that mean?

897
00:54:47.418 --> 00:54:49.620
- It means we might
just survive this.

898
00:54:49.654 --> 00:54:52.056
Listen. listen!

899
00:54:52.089 --> 00:54:54.058
It's down to us now.

900
00:54:54.058 --> 00:54:56.026
I know this was your
first day and my last

901
00:54:56.026 --> 00:54:57.995
and I take back
everything I said

902
00:54:57.995 --> 00:54:59.797
about nothing
happening in this town

903
00:54:59.797 --> 00:55:02.800
but this is my town
and I'm not retiring.

940
01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:21.458
- [Reporter] Hello.
this is Kathy Perkin

941
01:04:21.458 --> 01:04:24.028
with a channel 13
special news report.

942
01:04:24.094 --> 01:04:25.462
Breaking live.

943
01:04:25.462 --> 01:04:27.965
All parts of the
world are under attack

944
01:04:27.998 --> 01:04:30.968
from what appears to
be alien spaceships.

945
01:04:30.968 --> 01:04:32.469
I cannot believe I'm saying this

946
01:04:32.502 --> 01:04:36.540
but reports coming in are
that Toronto. New York.

947
01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:39.944
Paris. Moscow. and
London have been attacked

948
01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:42.679
and many famous landmarks
have been destroyed.

949
01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:45.882
Some world leaders
have been killed.

950
01:04:45.882 --> 01:04:47.384
We can now see some footage.

951
01:04:48.618 --> 01:04:51.288
This is like a scene
out of a war movie.

952
01:04:51.321 --> 01:04:54.992
It's total devastation
and destruction.

953
01:04:54.992 --> 01:04:56.426
The humanity.

954
01:04:56.426 --> 01:04:59.596
We don't know how many
causalities there have been

955
01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:02.532
but early estimates are
it's in the thousands.

956
01:05:06.136 --> 01:05:07.637
This is not a drill.

957
01:05:07.671 --> 01:05:10.007
This is a warning from
central government.

958
01:05:11.575 --> 01:05:13.177
Get away from the cities.

959
01:05:14.378 --> 01:05:16.880
go to a safe place
in the country.

960
01:05:18.748 --> 01:05:21.085
Arm yourself if you
can and be ready.

961
01:05:22.886 --> 01:05:24.054

01:06:44.468 --> 01:06:47.471
(eerie tense music)

967
01:06:51.541 --> 01:06:54.278
- We're gonna need
a bigger boat.

968
01:06:55.412 --> 01:06:57.247

969
01:06:59.183 --> 01:07:00.750
- Of course I have.

970
01:07:04.388 --> 01:07:05.755
Now let's give em hell.

971
01:07:09.259 --> 01:07:11.695
