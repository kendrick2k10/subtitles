3
00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:15.492
Man on TV:
War continues in Europe.

4
00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:16.910
Hitler has suggested
that any questions

5
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.371
over the future of Poland
will be settled entirely

6
00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:21.331
between Germany and Russia.

7
00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:22.749
He also stated that he regards

8
00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:25.168
the Czechoslovak Question
as closed.

9
00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:26.503
Speaking at Washington.

10
00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:28.797
President Roosevelt made
no comment as to...

11
00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:36.323
The name's Cavendish.

12
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.162
A Miss Cavendish.

13
00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:48.668
Perhaps it's a first name.
Cavendish?

14
00:02:52.214 --> 00:02:54.841
Um. cigarette?

15
00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:56.802
The cigarettes you keep
for your clients.

16
00:02:56.802 --> 00:02:58.970
are they better or worse than
what you smoke?

17
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.639
They're the same.

18
00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:05.435
Perhaps it is a first name. Cavendish.

19
00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:09.523
It's... a good first name.

20
00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:10.774
Mm.

21
00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:17.030
Please.

22
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.701
How private exactly are your
investigations. Mr. Marlowe?

23
00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:26.415
What can I do for you.
Mrs. Cavendish?

24
00:03:26.415 --> 00:03:28.708
Mm. you are a detective.

25
00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:32.254
I'd like you
to find someone for me.

26
00:03:32.254 --> 00:03:33.338
Mm-hmm.

27
00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:34.881
Nico Peterson.

28
00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:39.719
He was my lover. he disappeared
without saying goodbye.

29
00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:43.056
When you say disappeared.
do you mean out of your life

30
00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:45.225
or out of the world?

31
00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:47.811
I don't know.
that's why I'm here.

32
00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:50.397
Where was your husband.
Mrs. Cavendish.

33
00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:53.900
when your lover Nico Peterson
disappeared?

34
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.902
In retrospect...

35
00:03:57.696 --> 00:04:00.782
do call me Cavendish
without the Missus.

36
00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:02.409
I like it.

37
00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.369
Was your lover the sort of man
to disappear

38
00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:06.246
with you as a lover?

39
00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:08.707
Normally.
they don't disappear easily.

40
00:04:08.707 --> 00:04:11.418
No. I bet they don't.

41
00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:12.878
They stay around.

42
00:04:12.878 --> 00:04:16.381
climb trellises.
scenes in restaurants.

43
00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:19.217
lie down in the road.
promise you anything.

44
00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:20.760
Oh. I know how it goes.

45
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.513
Do you lie down
in the road. Mr. Marlowe?

46
00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:27.893
- Drink?
- Please.

47
00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:34.983
Well. he's tall. like you.

48
00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:36.526
Bit of a weaker man.

49
00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:40.530
He dresses nice. meticulously.

50
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.909
What does that say about a man?

51
00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:46.620
Does Mr. Peterson get money
from his profession

52
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.040
or does he just
profess his profession?

53
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.459
You seem to assume
that I was involved

54
00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:55.337
with someone unsuitable.

55
00:04:55.337 --> 00:04:58.548
Yes. unless you were
unsuitable for him.

56
00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:02.802
Go to hell.
you pathetic little...

57
00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:05.305
Would it be accurate
to say that Mr. Peterson

58
00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:08.642
would be a marginal person
in motion pictures?

59
00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:10.519
- Apologies. sir.
- Yes. Alright.

60
00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:11.978
It would be accurate.

61
00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:13.939
it would be
very accurate indeed.

62
00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:15.649
Man 1: Go to hell.
you pathetic...

63
00:05:19.653 --> 00:05:21.530
We would meet
at the Corbata Club.

64
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.073
Do you know it?

65
00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:26.368
How did Mr. Peterson
know the Corbata Club?

66
00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:27.827
Was he your guest

67
00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:31.456
or the kind of guy
who was anybody's guest?

68
00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:33.917
My husband and I
have an arrangement.

69
00:05:35.627 --> 00:05:39.464
May I ask.
is your husband homosexual?

70
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.720
No. He isn't remotely
that interesting.

71
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.848
He likes polo.
alcohol. waitresses

72
00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:50.016
and my money.

73
00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:52.644
Your money.
Mrs. Cavendish?

74
00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:54.354
I beg your pardon. Mr. Marlowe.

75
00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:56.439
I'm asking if the
money is yours.

76
00:05:57.524 --> 00:06:00.986
My father was in oil.
he's dead.

77
00:06:00.986 --> 00:06:04.489
You'd know my mother.
but we won't discuss her now.

78
00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:08.702
Did you conduct your affair
with Mr. Peterson at the club?

79
00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:11.371
We weren't meeting
in the horse sheds. Mr. Marlowe.

80
00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:14.749
What did he not show up for?

81
00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:17.961
An assignation.

82
00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:27.846
I telephoned him
a few times. no answer.

83
00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:30.432
and then I went to his house
the following week.

84
00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:33.101
The milk hadn't been canceled

85
00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:35.895
and the newspapers
were piled up on his porch.

86
00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:40.525
Did he have
things to hide?

87
00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:42.402
Haven't we all?

88
00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:46.197
What do you think
has become of Mr. Peterson?

89
00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:48.700
Told you.
I want a set of fresh eyes

90
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.037
and yours come
highly recommended.

91
00:06:52.037 --> 00:06:54.914
Maybe you'll find out
what I can't.

92
00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:08.928
My name's really Clare.
like the county.

93
00:07:11.306 --> 00:07:12.599
You know the county?

94
00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:15.644
Yeah. in Ireland.
I know it well.

95
00:07:15.644 --> 00:07:20.565
My mother was in pictures.
you'd know her.

96
00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:23.693
It's rather embarrassing
with the upper class.

97
00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:29.157
You're very perceptive
and sensitive. Mr. Marlowe.

98
00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:36.039
I imagine it gives you trouble.

99
00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:17.997
He ain't home. bo.

100
00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:22.168
What? He owe you dough
or make time with your wife?

101
00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:23.503
That's the way it is. huh?

102
00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:27.173
Yeah. I'd say so.
and good for him.

103
00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:31.803
He's not a bad guy. if you don't
trust people anyway. I don't.

104
00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:36.474
I think he's from Cleveland.

105
00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:38.351
That's my place
across the street.

106
00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:40.478
he used to come over sometimes.

107
00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:42.397
pass the time of day.

108
00:08:42.397 --> 00:08:44.524
Give me a smoke.

109
00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:47.193
How. uh. how long
has he been gone?

110
00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:50.280
Oh. I guess I last seen him
seven weeks ago.

111
00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:53.742
You. uh. you see him leave?

112
00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:56.745
No. I just noticed he was gone.

113
00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:00.373
How did you know?

114
00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:03.042
Well. he wasn't there anymore.

115
00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:05.795
That means there weren't any
women banging on his front door.

116
00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:08.548
or throwing a shoe at the house.

117
00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:12.761
I mean. I did pretty good
in my day. but not like him.

118
00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:14.888
Are you a cop?

119
00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:16.306
Sort of.

120
00:09:16.306 --> 00:09:19.058
A private dick ain't no cop.

121
00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:22.896
Yeah. you're not the first one
to come around asking about him.

122
00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:25.565
A pair of wetbacks
showed up last week.

123
00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:29.068
and they was all gussied up.
but a beaner in a suit

124
00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:31.696
and fancy necktie.
it's still a beaner. right?

125
00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:34.157
No. sometimes
he's the King of Spain.

126
00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:36.910
King of Spain don't ride
around in no Lincoln.

127
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.037
with a Mexican re-spray.

128
00:09:39.037 --> 00:09:42.040
Yeah. I used to work in the low
end of the motor trade myself.

129
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.209
it was two beaners in a hot car

130
00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:47.253
that had been across
the border and back.

131
00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:56.012
Oh. let's start
at the beginning.

132
00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:58.264
This guy's been looked at. sure.

133
00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:01.059
Grifts. alienations
of affection.

134
00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:04.437
parking tickets.
drunk at a social gathering.

135
00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:08.233
And in the early days.
public solicitation.

136
00:10:08.233 --> 00:10:09.901
Now nobody knew
he ever had a house.

137
00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:12.195
he's down as domicile unknown.

138
00:10:12.195 --> 00:10:13.822
He does have a house.
I was there.

139
00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:15.281
Yeah. well.
there's having a house

140
00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:17.408
and being the person paying
for it. I suppose.

141
00:10:17.408 --> 00:10:18.785
Who was paying for it?

142
00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:20.745
Well. I think you'll find
he was paying cash

143
00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:23.373
from his no visible
means of support.

144
00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:33.049
Hope the lady friend looking
for him looks good in black.

145
00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:36.886
He was killed.
October 22nd. hit and run.

146
00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:38.721
Outside the Corbata Club.

147
00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:41.516
You owe me lunch.

148
00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:43.476
Liquid or regular?

149
00:10:48.857 --> 00:10:50.733
"Deceased was struck
by a vehicle. make unknown.

150
00:10:50.733 --> 00:10:52.652
driver unknown.
on Bay Canyon Drive

151
00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.070
just outside the Corbata Club.

152
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.822
Deceased has numerous
injuries including

153
00:10:55.822 --> 00:10:58.324
gross comminuted fracture
right side of his skull.

154
00:10:58.324 --> 00:10:59.659
Death be not proud."

155
00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:42.368
I guess there's no point
in asking for an invite.

156
00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:44.037
Oh. none at all. sir.

157
00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:45.872
Uh-huh.

158
00:11:57.216 --> 00:11:58.968
Oh. hey!

159
00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:04.390
You looking for a gardening job?

160
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.893
Actually. no.
a membership form.

161
00:12:08.102 --> 00:12:10.855
Albert. We've got
a hedge hopper here.

162
00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:12.357
He needs trimming.

163
00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:15.652
A ver.

164
00:12:15.652 --> 00:12:17.070
- Hey. buddy.
- A ver.

165
00:12:27.497 --> 00:12:31.584
Maybe there's a reason
you're unpopular with policemen.

166
00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:34.629
Keep getting. I don't know...

167
00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:37.757
punched. locked up.

168
00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:39.801
and almost.
but not quite. charged

169
00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:43.221
with accessory.
obstruction. etcetera.

170
00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:46.265
- And at your age.
- It's my manner. Joe.

171
00:12:46.265 --> 00:12:49.310
Yup. starting to wish
you still had your pension?

172
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:51.062
Sure you are.

173
00:12:51.062 --> 00:12:54.524
Look. Marlowe. listen...

174
00:12:54.524 --> 00:12:57.235
This guy got killed after
getting sauced in there.

175
00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.279
The remains smelled
like a brewery.

176
00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:02.490
and he had marks
up and down his arms.

177
00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.158
his head popped like a pumpkin.

178
00:13:04.158 --> 00:13:05.910
The Corbata Club
likes to make it nice.

179
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.328
it does not like trouble.

180
00:13:07.328 --> 00:13:09.372
Hit and run
is two crimes at least.

181
00:13:09.372 --> 00:13:10.957
Don't fuck with me.
this is LA.

182
00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:12.291
These guys like Peterson

183
00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:13.960
are a dime a dozen.
they come out here.

184
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.378
they fail a screen test
and they do what they've to do.

185
00:13:15.378 --> 00:13:17.171
Could any member
of the Corbata Club

186
00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:19.132
not know that he was dead?

187
00:13:19.132 --> 00:13:20.883
From our own Chief of Detectives

188
00:13:20.883 --> 00:13:22.802
to the new
Ambassador to England.

189
00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:25.430
I find it highly unlikely
it didn't come up over cream tea

190
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:28.808
that a scumbag had caught
a Buick at the front entrance.

191
00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:31.144
Did they ask you
to broom the case?

192
00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:33.646
No one has to ask. my brother.

193
00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:35.273
Can I see the police file?

194
00:13:36.482 --> 00:13:38.067
We don't need it.

195
00:13:42.989 --> 00:13:44.574
Why you looking for this guy?

196
00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:48.327
A lady wanted to find him.

197
00:13:48.327 --> 00:13:50.329
Well. he'll wait
until she comes by.

198
00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:10.767
Go back to Boston. to
that miserable goddamn family.

199
00:14:10.767 --> 00:14:17.023
And then onto England. the court
of Saint fucking James.

200
00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:20.026
You're not the only one
who's done with this.

201
00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:21.235
Just remember one thing.

202
00:14:21.235 --> 00:14:23.863
Oh. please. darling.
not another.

203
00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:25.907
I paid for that horse.

204
00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:27.617
I get to keep him too.

205
00:14:31.329 --> 00:14:33.331
Could you. uh. do mine after?

206
00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:39.045
Are you the new mechanic?

207
00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:41.047
Maybe. what's it paying?

208
00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:43.633
- You've a name?
- Marlowe.

209
00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:45.802
This is hell nor am I out of it.

210
00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:47.386
That was his one good line.

211
00:14:47.386 --> 00:14:49.847
You don't think
he was Shakespeare.

212
00:14:49.847 --> 00:14:51.224
Neither did he.

213
00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:53.142
Maybe I am out of it.

214
00:14:55.394 --> 00:14:57.021
Well out of it.

215
00:15:18.084 --> 00:15:20.378
You startled me. Marlowe.

216
00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:23.422
Apologies. seems to be my day
for startling.

217
00:15:27.677 --> 00:15:29.428
Who else did you startle?

218
00:15:29.428 --> 00:15:32.932
Some elegant Mick outside.
who quoted Marlowe.

219
00:15:34.142 --> 00:15:35.643
Are you quotable. Mr. Marlowe?

220
00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:37.103
Christopher Marlowe.

221
00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:41.149
Ah. he played in Doctor Faustus
at the Harvard Rep.

222
00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:42.859
Never lets anyone forget that.

223
00:15:42.859 --> 00:15:44.777
- He?
- Hm.

224
00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:48.614
Joseph O'Reilly.
my mother's financial adviser.

225
00:15:48.614 --> 00:15:51.617
oh. and soon to be
Ambassador to England.

226
00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:54.453
he never lets anyone forget
about that either.

227
00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:57.123
What did he play.
one of the seven deadly sins?

228
00:15:57.123 --> 00:15:59.041
Please.

229
00:16:00.585 --> 00:16:03.087
Iced tea?

230
00:16:03.087 --> 00:16:04.630
You could have some of mine
if you like.

231
00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.716
No. thank you.

232
00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:08.634
I can offer you anything really.

233
00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:10.595
it's like the Arabian Nights
around here.

234
00:16:10.595 --> 00:16:12.013
Clare!

235
00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:14.223
Clare!

236
00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:20.104
Who the hell is this?

237
00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:24.192
Sorry. I'm. I'm Philip Marlowe.

238
00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:28.029
Hello. Marlowe. Cavendish.

239
00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:32.158
Mr. Marlowe calls me
Cavendish. Richard. I like it.

240
00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:33.784
It's your name. darling.

241
00:16:33.784 --> 00:16:35.453
I like it as a first name.

242
00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:37.747
Glad I'm good
for something. dear.

243
00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:39.332
Have you. um. offered

244
00:16:39.332 --> 00:16:42.418
your very large friend
a proper drink. darling?

245
00:16:42.418 --> 00:16:45.838
She did. and I declined.
thank you.

246
00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:50.885
So. Mr. Marlowe. what kind of
business are you in?

247
00:16:50.885 --> 00:16:52.720
Mr. Marlowe detects things.

248
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.973
Ah. and what are you
detecting here. Marlowe?

249
00:16:55.973 --> 00:16:59.518
My necklace.
I lost it. he found it.

250
00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:02.688
Of course he did.
I wonder where.

251
00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:05.441
Well. it was a matter of
retracing your wife's steps.

252
00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:09.195
- Marlowe.
- Yes. Mr. Cavendish.

253
00:17:09.195 --> 00:17:10.613
Fuck yourself.

254
00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:14.408
It's a pleasure to meet you too.
Mr. Cavendish.

255
00:17:16.035 --> 00:17:18.287
Didn't go for it.
that's odd.

256
00:17:19.664 --> 00:17:22.166
He must think there's
something between us...

257
00:17:23.292 --> 00:17:27.213
probably something... sexual.

258
00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:31.509
So tell me about you
and Mr. Peterson

259
00:17:31.509 --> 00:17:34.136
with no embellishments. please.

260
00:17:37.974 --> 00:17:41.727
I met him at the Corbata
Club for the first time.

261
00:17:41.727 --> 00:17:43.646
Thought he was handsome.

262
00:17:43.646 --> 00:17:49.110
We made love. and then I saw
him again. a few weeks later.

263
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:51.821
not an assignation.
an accident.

264
00:17:51.821 --> 00:17:56.117
In Tijuana at my favorite bar.
La Quinteria.

265
00:17:56.117 --> 00:17:58.077
I was there with my husband.

266
00:17:58.077 --> 00:18:01.289
We were watching the
procession. Dia de los Muertos.

267
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.432
What was
he hustling in Mexico?

268
00:18:19.432 --> 00:18:23.227
I don't know.
Nico has many schemes.

269
00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:27.106
He's in the grave.

270
00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:29.608
Nico Peterson is dead.

271
00:18:29.608 --> 00:18:31.110
He's pretending.

272
00:18:32.194 --> 00:18:33.863
He's pretending very well.

273
00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:36.615
Oh. I know.
he's dead and buried.

274
00:18:36.615 --> 00:18:41.120
That he got killed in front of
the Corbata Club. supposedly.

275
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.791
Everybody says he was.

276
00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:49.128
But you see. the significant
thing is that

277
00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:52.465
I saw him the other day.
from the street.

278
00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:54.383
not in my mind's eye.

279
00:18:54.383 --> 00:18:57.136
on the street.
not dead at all.

280
00:18:57.136 --> 00:18:59.638
I think we're finished.
Mrs. Cavendish.

281
00:18:59.638 --> 00:19:00.723
No.

282
00:19:01.974 --> 00:19:04.310
I just wanted you to start
at the beginning.

283
00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:06.937
Begin at the beginning.

284
00:19:06.937 --> 00:19:09.440
that's what you're supposed
to do. right?

285
00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.109
- Where did you see him?
- Back in Tijuana.

286
00:19:12.109 --> 00:19:15.988
My mother wanted me to view
some Azteca horses.

287
00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:17.531
you know the prancing kind.

288
00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:23.329
I did that.
I do what she says.

289
00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:25.498
So I was in La Quinteria again.

290
00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:28.000
having one of their
divine mojitos

291
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.461
when I saw Nico
driving down the street.

292
00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:43.474
He called himself
a collector.

293
00:19:43.474 --> 00:19:47.520
Most of all collected junk.
pretend antiques.

294
00:19:51.315 --> 00:19:54.735
I suppose
they're for the movies...

295
00:19:54.735 --> 00:19:58.364
things that don't exist.
fairy tales.

296
00:19:59.407 --> 00:20:00.699
There's a man in Baja.

297
00:20:00.699 --> 00:20:03.202
who thinks Nico's
actually a producer.

298
00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:06.247
He's been fleeced.

299
00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:10.459
What? What's wrong?

300
00:20:10.459 --> 00:20:12.586
You lied to me. Mrs. Cavendish.

301
00:20:12.586 --> 00:20:15.339
And I sat there and watched you
lie to your husband.

302
00:20:15.339 --> 00:20:16.882
Good afternoon.

303
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:31.605
Hello. Mr...

304
00:20:31.605 --> 00:20:32.565
Marlowe.

305
00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:34.024
Oh. of course. I knew that.

306
00:20:34.024 --> 00:20:36.735
Richard made a call
when you first came in.

307
00:20:36.735 --> 00:20:39.196
You know what they say
about the old boys' club?

308
00:20:39.196 --> 00:20:40.906
What's that?

309
00:20:40.906 --> 00:20:42.700
There really is one.

310
00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.661
And what did he find.
Madame. uh...

311
00:20:45.661 --> 00:20:50.332
Dorothy Quincannon. and
don't pretend you don't know.

312
00:20:52.585 --> 00:20:56.505
Well. let's see.
you had a bad war.

313
00:20:56.505 --> 00:20:58.549
and then in the twenties.
you drank yourself

314
00:20:58.549 --> 00:21:00.301
out of a good job
in the oil business.

315
00:21:00.301 --> 00:21:01.343
Did I?

316
00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:03.429
Got on with the Los Angeles DA

317
00:21:03.429 --> 00:21:06.849
as an investigator. but that
didn't work out too well either.

318
00:21:06.849 --> 00:21:08.642
did it. Mr. Marlowe?

319
00:21:08.642 --> 00:21:11.562
You see. he found all that out
in five minutes.

320
00:21:12.771 --> 00:21:16.442
You're not the only one
who can make enquiries.

321
00:21:16.442 --> 00:21:19.236
You weren't looking for pearls.

322
00:21:19.236 --> 00:21:23.782
No. I throw them before swine.
it's a habit of mine.

323
00:21:23.782 --> 00:21:27.620
Tell me. Mr. Marlowe.
what does my daughter want?

324
00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:31.081
A divorce?
I might even approve.

325
00:21:31.081 --> 00:21:34.168
I'm sorry. I only discuss
business with my employer.

326
00:21:34.168 --> 00:21:37.171
so if you'll excuse me.

327
00:21:37.171 --> 00:21:39.048
- Slan.
- Slan.

328
00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.110
Excuse me?

329
00:23:01.213 --> 00:23:03.340
- Hey. Fergus.
- Oh. hello.

330
00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.593
Ah. Jesus. here it is.

331
00:23:05.593 --> 00:23:08.012
Not a single lead
on who ran Peterson down.

332
00:23:08.012 --> 00:23:10.931
- We pursued inquiries.
- But how far?

333
00:23:10.931 --> 00:23:14.018
Marlowe. if one wanted
to find an absolute nest

334
00:23:14.018 --> 00:23:16.395
of entitled
and connected tosspots

335
00:23:16.395 --> 00:23:18.063
who feel they can
just drive away

336
00:23:18.063 --> 00:23:19.773
after running over
another drunk's head.

337
00:23:19.773 --> 00:23:22.151
you go to the Corbata Club.

338
00:23:22.151 --> 00:23:25.237
There were no witnesses.
a suspect wasn't possible.

339
00:23:25.237 --> 00:23:27.448
Saturday night. they come and go
at that club like rats

340
00:23:27.448 --> 00:23:29.241
through a hole in a garbage can.

341
00:23:29.241 --> 00:23:30.909
It could have been
any one of a hundred cars

342
00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:33.579
that flattened him. and probably
none of them contained

343
00:23:33.579 --> 00:23:35.789
anybody it'd be wise to arrest.

344
00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:39.585
We're in the real world here.
You understand a real world.

345
00:23:39.585 --> 00:23:41.170
Sometimes justice is blind.

346
00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:43.881
sometimes justice doesn't give
a shit and might be right.

347
00:23:43.881 --> 00:23:47.176
So who's the mystery broad
you're working for? His sister?

348
00:23:47.176 --> 00:23:48.636
Tell me about his sister.

349
00:23:48.636 --> 00:23:50.721
Maybe she identified him.
maybe she didn't.

350
00:23:50.721 --> 00:23:52.348
You tell me about his sister.

351
00:23:52.348 --> 00:23:56.060
I got my own sister. you can
stick his sister up your ass.

352
00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.770
I'm working for a person
who thinks

353
00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:01.065
that Nico Peterson
is still alive.

354
00:24:01.065 --> 00:24:05.361
Yeah. that's complicated.
I'm not a complicated man.

355
00:24:05.361 --> 00:24:07.613
My client claims
to have seen him.

356
00:24:07.613 --> 00:24:09.907
which gives you
a murder. my friend.

357
00:24:09.907 --> 00:24:11.950
Yeah. I got plenty. thanks.

358
00:24:13.994 --> 00:24:15.454
Here's your file.

359
00:24:17.665 --> 00:24:20.459
My employer thinks
he didn't die.

360
00:24:20.459 --> 00:24:21.835
that it wasn't him
that got smashed

361
00:24:21.835 --> 00:24:24.963
outside the Corbata Club.
to repeat myself.

362
00:24:24.963 --> 00:24:29.635
It gives me a murder. yeah.
theoretically. maybe.

363
00:24:29.635 --> 00:24:32.846
What's your trouble gents?
Money or women?

364
00:24:32.846 --> 00:24:35.015
Both. with the
complication of thirst.

365
00:24:35.015 --> 00:24:38.394
He's like the rest of us. Pat.
except he can't take a hint.

366
00:24:38.394 --> 00:24:40.145
- What'll you have?
- Whiskey.

367
00:24:40.145 --> 00:24:42.481
Usual.

368
00:24:42.481 --> 00:24:43.774
What's going on these days Patrick.

369
00:24:43.774 --> 00:24:45.651
you. you married. or happy?

370
00:24:45.651 --> 00:24:47.444
At least my laundry's done.

371
00:24:47.444 --> 00:24:48.779
Pat had a rough
two weeks finding

372
00:24:48.779 --> 00:24:52.074
clean drawers after
he lost his mother.

373
00:24:52.074 --> 00:24:53.158
Fuck yourself.

374
00:24:53.158 --> 00:24:54.993
If I could. I wouldn't
have to listen.

375
00:24:54.993 --> 00:24:57.663
If it was an operation.
I'd sign up.

376
00:24:58.956 --> 00:25:01.792
If he's alive. Joe.
you have a homicide.

377
00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:05.254
Gonna keep saying that?

378
00:25:05.254 --> 00:25:07.339
That's the last thing
you want in homicide.

379
00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:08.841
I realize. homicide.

380
00:25:08.841 --> 00:25:11.510
What. you think
it was a homicide?

381
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:14.012
I went to the graveyard.
Guess what?

382
00:25:14.012 --> 00:25:16.014
- He was cremated.
- Good guess.

383
00:25:16.014 --> 00:25:19.309
Yeah. even the teeth
were destroyed

384
00:25:19.309 --> 00:25:20.686
and they'd be everywhere.

385
00:25:20.686 --> 00:25:23.272
You ever run over a rat
or a cat. look at it?

386
00:25:23.272 --> 00:25:26.358
If Peterson didn't die. who did?

387
00:25:26.358 --> 00:25:30.696
Look. Marlowe. I know you got
this Sir Lancelot bullshit.

388
00:25:30.696 --> 00:25:32.197
and you live like some monk.

389
00:25:32.197 --> 00:25:35.325
you got no regular self-interest
anyone can count on.

390
00:25:35.325 --> 00:25:38.704
you like getting sapped and
locked up for just not stopping.

391
00:25:38.704 --> 00:25:42.875
and this is an interesting story
you have. if true.

392
00:25:42.875 --> 00:25:46.044
But that stiff. Peterson.
for all intents and purposes.

393
00:25:46.044 --> 00:25:48.505
had Peterson's wallet
in his pocket.

394
00:25:48.505 --> 00:25:50.299
Plus. he was identified
at the scene.

395
00:25:50.299 --> 00:25:52.092
for all intents and purposes.

396
00:25:52.092 --> 00:25:53.177
By who?

397
00:25:53.177 --> 00:25:54.845
The manager of the club.
Floyd Hanson.

398
00:25:54.845 --> 00:25:57.890
and by the Los Angeles
County Coroner. who's a member.

399
00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:00.934
So. it's nobody's business now
but county.

400
00:26:01.894 --> 00:26:03.520
County line runs where?

401
00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.189
Bay Canyon Drive.

402
00:26:10.235 --> 00:26:12.279
Right along here?

403
00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:14.072
Oh. Jesus.

404
00:26:17.242 --> 00:26:18.744
Make the call. Joe.

405
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:21.830
I'll keep you out of it.

406
00:26:32.257 --> 00:26:36.428
Mr. Hanson says it's most
irregular. Mr. Marlowe.

407
00:26:36.428 --> 00:26:37.971
but he'll see you.

408
00:26:37.971 --> 00:26:40.808
Keep to the left. follow
the signs that say reception.

409
00:26:40.808 --> 00:26:42.392
Oh. thank you.

410
00:27:12.923 --> 00:27:14.842
I'm Floyd Hanson
the manager.

411
00:27:16.093 --> 00:27:17.761
What can I do for you.
Mr. Marlowe?

412
00:27:17.761 --> 00:27:20.430
Don't bother turning off
the car.

413
00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:22.683
The gateman tells me
you're a private investigator.

414
00:27:22.683 --> 00:27:24.101
could that be so?

415
00:27:24.101 --> 00:27:26.854
Yes. I used to work
for the DA's office.

416
00:27:26.854 --> 00:27:29.815
- I've heard that.
- I've heard that you've heard.

417
00:27:32.192 --> 00:27:34.945
I'm here about an
accident that occurred.

418
00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:39.324
- A serious one?
- Nico Peterson.

419
00:27:39.324 --> 00:27:40.826
Well. that actually
wasn't on the property.

420
00:27:40.826 --> 00:27:42.202
that was more
in the public road.

421
00:27:42.202 --> 00:27:44.830
Oh. I fully appreciate
the distinction.

422
00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:47.291
but sometimes people
get moved off the property

423
00:27:47.291 --> 00:27:50.794
even though their leg is lying
on it a little bit.

424
00:27:50.794 --> 00:27:53.338
There was an interesting case
in Cincinnati.

425
00:27:53.338 --> 00:27:54.965
What was that?

426
00:27:54.965 --> 00:27:58.260
A man was beaten to death.
and then he was put in the road.

427
00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:00.846
and his head was run over
by a tire.

428
00:28:00.846 --> 00:28:03.473
to obliterate the cause of death

429
00:28:03.473 --> 00:28:05.809
and to get him off the property.

430
00:28:05.809 --> 00:28:07.311
Mr. Peterson was run down
on the road.

431
00:28:07.311 --> 00:28:09.479
and the road is not
on the property.

432
00:28:09.479 --> 00:28:11.148
I appreciate that.

433
00:28:11.148 --> 00:28:13.358
Was Peterson a member
of this club?

434
00:28:13.358 --> 00:28:16.153
No. Mr. Peterson
wasn't a member. No.

435
00:28:16.153 --> 00:28:18.238
That's because
you're exclusive I imagine.

436
00:28:18.238 --> 00:28:20.741
We are.
but your meaning. sir?

437
00:28:22.951 --> 00:28:24.703
What would we do without Mexico?

438
00:28:24.703 --> 00:28:28.373
Mexico's the future. we have a
sister club in Baja. California.

439
00:28:28.373 --> 00:28:31.418
- Looks like the past.
- It must be brought along.

440
00:28:31.418 --> 00:28:33.545
Mexico or its inhabitants?

441
00:28:33.545 --> 00:28:35.088
Stick to the point. Mr. Marlowe.

442
00:28:36.214 --> 00:28:37.841
It must have been
a shock for you.

443
00:28:37.841 --> 00:28:40.302
seeing Mr. Peterson
on the road like that.

444
00:28:40.302 --> 00:28:43.680
I was at Chateau Thierry.
old man. Belleau Wood.

445
00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:45.098
I have seen men in more disarray

446
00:28:45.098 --> 00:28:47.142
than that in which
Mr. Peterson was discovered.

447
00:28:48.685 --> 00:28:50.270
Once. after an artillery strike.

448
00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:53.315
I found a friend's tooth
in my whiskey glass.

449
00:28:53.315 --> 00:28:54.858
I drank the whiskey.

450
00:28:55.734 --> 00:28:57.486
You're a terrible man.

451
00:28:57.486 --> 00:29:00.405
He was dead.
and I needed the whiskey.

452
00:29:00.405 --> 00:29:02.658
You're my age.
perhaps you were there.

453
00:29:02.658 --> 00:29:05.911
perhaps you know how it was.
and therefore is.

454
00:29:05.911 --> 00:29:09.164
Royal Irish Rifles.
The Somme.

455
00:29:09.164 --> 00:29:11.750
For the rest of time.
we see the dead.

456
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:15.379
Let's take a stroll.
Mr. Marlowe.

457
00:29:15.379 --> 00:29:17.756
We're alive.
when others are not.

458
00:29:17.756 --> 00:29:19.424
and it's a pleasant morning.

459
00:29:26.348 --> 00:29:27.808
I see
you've made inequity

460
00:29:27.808 --> 00:29:29.226
pretty much your profession.

461
00:29:29.226 --> 00:29:32.229
The Club is exclusive.
The rich like to play.

462
00:29:32.229 --> 00:29:35.065
The polo grounds are over there.

463
00:29:35.065 --> 00:29:39.778
So whose guest was Mr. Peterson
the night he was killed?

464
00:29:39.778 --> 00:29:42.072
Who's your employer Mr. Marlowe?

465
00:29:42.072 --> 00:29:45.033
We're at an impasse.
Mr. Hanson. Who's yours?

466
00:29:45.033 --> 00:29:46.535
I don't know
what you want me to tell you.

467
00:29:46.535 --> 00:29:48.996
the police were thorough.
aren't they always.

468
00:29:48.996 --> 00:29:51.665
isn't that what they do.
be thorough?

469
00:29:51.665 --> 00:29:55.377
I rarely blame a policeman
unless he's really bad.

470
00:29:55.377 --> 00:29:58.130
There's generally someone
he's afraid of.

471
00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:01.842
And who in this instance would
any policeman be afraid of?

472
00:30:01.842 --> 00:30:03.885
Well. if the hit and run driver

473
00:30:03.885 --> 00:30:07.639
were a very substantial
or a connected person.

474
00:30:07.639 --> 00:30:10.308
a policeman might be afraid
of the Club in general.

475
00:30:10.308 --> 00:30:11.810
I mean. I am.

476
00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:14.730
What would it take for you
not to be afraid? What can I do?

477
00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:18.275
Now. listen. Mr. Hanson.
I intend to ask questions.

478
00:30:18.275 --> 00:30:20.027
Then ask your damn questions.

479
00:30:20.027 --> 00:30:22.029
Now this was a hit and run.

480
00:30:22.029 --> 00:30:23.780
and given the road.
it was probably a member.

481
00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:27.659
and perhaps the driver didn't
even know he'd struck anything.

482
00:30:27.659 --> 00:30:30.454
Everybody in this country has
been drunk since its inception.

483
00:30:30.454 --> 00:30:33.373
I don't think I've ever even
seen a sober driver.

484
00:30:34.999 --> 00:30:36.501
Shall we have some tea?

485
00:30:38.837 --> 00:30:40.881
Is there much
gambling here. Mr. Hanson?

486
00:30:40.881 --> 00:30:42.841
You're on very dangerous ground.

487
00:30:42.841 --> 00:30:44.384
There are cards that are played.

488
00:30:44.384 --> 00:30:45.844
Debts accumulated.

489
00:30:45.844 --> 00:30:48.430
There are card rooms.
they're private.

490
00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:49.681
Bedrooms?

491
00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:51.600
We have guest accommodations.

492
00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.478
Do studio men and the producers
have meetings here?

493
00:30:55.437 --> 00:30:57.355
Why am I talking to you?

494
00:30:57.355 --> 00:30:59.649
Because you don't know
who hired me.

495
00:30:59.649 --> 00:31:01.318
Well. name the thing
that most intrigues you.

496
00:31:01.318 --> 00:31:04.362
perhaps we could
conclude our chat.

497
00:31:04.362 --> 00:31:06.615
There is the possibility
that the dead man

498
00:31:06.615 --> 00:31:09.326
was not Nico Peterson.

499
00:31:09.326 --> 00:31:12.746
His sister was shown his corpse
the next day at the morgue

500
00:31:12.746 --> 00:31:14.206
and expressed no doubts.

501
00:31:14.206 --> 00:31:15.957
Where could I find his sister?

502
00:31:18.418 --> 00:31:19.961
Ask the police.

503
00:31:32.349 --> 00:31:36.186
Why do you raise the possibility
that Peterson is alive.

504
00:31:36.186 --> 00:31:38.230
when I so clearly saw him dead?

505
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:41.399
Someone may have seen him
recently in the street.

506
00:31:41.399 --> 00:31:44.736
And where was this.
uh. supposedly?

507
00:31:44.736 --> 00:31:46.071
I can't tell you.

508
00:31:47.114 --> 00:31:48.740
Goodbye. Mr. Marlowe.

509
00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:52.327
I'm sorry that it was ultimately
uninteresting to talk to you.

510
00:31:54.538 --> 00:31:56.331
Ah. but I do like this thing
that you have

511
00:31:56.331 --> 00:31:59.209
about not being afraid.
when you should be.

512
00:32:02.254 --> 00:32:04.172
I'll see myself out.

513
00:32:19.729 --> 00:32:22.649

514
00:32:22.649 --> 00:32:25.277

Well. not yet anyway.

520
00:32:43.253 --> 00:32:45.297
They do like to keep it exclusive.

521
00:32:45.297 --> 00:32:47.257
Yeah. it seems that way.

522
00:32:48.633 --> 00:32:51.636
Try me at the Cabana.
Venice Beach.

523
00:32:52.804 --> 00:32:54.306
Excuse me?

524

Ask for Lynn. Lynn Peterson.

00:32:57.934 --> 00:33:01.062
- You're Nico's sister.
- Sir?

527
00:33:01.062 --> 00:33:02.647

Lynn. I'm not sure
if it's an N. or an E.

00:33:41.311 --> 00:33:43.813
Madam Cabana: With an X
if she works here.

531
00:33:43.813 --> 00:33:45.398
There you go.

532
00:33:45.398 --> 00:33:47.692
Robe's in the cabinet.
and no monkey business.

533
00:33:47.692 --> 00:33:49.194

Here he is.

537
00:34:15.887 --> 00:34:18.556
Mr. Hanson sends his apologies.

538
00:34:18.556 --> 00:34:20.517
Lynn Peterson's been detained.

539
00:34:20.517 --> 00:34:25.188
Oh. I'm. uh.
I'm sorry to hear that.

Ah. fuck it.

Dorothy Quincannon

That's in 20 minutes.
Dorothy Quincannon.

00:35:16.406 --> 00:35:18.950
Did you come
for the film stars. Hilda?

550
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:21.119
I came to bloody be one.

551
00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:22.245
Huh.

552
00:35:32.464 --> 00:35:34.466
First of all.
you have to boil the water.

553
00:35:34.466 --> 00:35:36.051
now is that water boiled?

554
00:35:36.051 --> 00:35:38.219
Yes. ma'am.
- And then scald the teapot.

555
00:35:38.219 --> 00:35:40.305
- Give it a good scalding.
- Alright.

556
00:35:40.305 --> 00:35:44.017
Put in one teaspoon per cup.
then one for the pot

557
00:35:44.017 --> 00:35:47.228
and then leave it to draw
for three minutes.

558
00:35:48.646 --> 00:35:51.107
Think of a soft boiled egg. darling.

559
00:35:51.107 --> 00:35:53.651
three minutes.
no more. no less

560
00:35:53.651 --> 00:35:56.154
and then you're ready to pour.
have you got that?

561
00:35:56.154 --> 00:35:58.198
Y-- yes. ma'am.

562
00:35:58.198 --> 00:36:00.033
When you make tea. make tea.

563
00:36:00.033 --> 00:36:02.869
When you make water. make water.

564
00:36:02.869 --> 00:36:04.329
Water.

565
00:36:04.329 --> 00:36:05.997
I-- I don't think he got it.

566
00:36:05.997 --> 00:36:08.541
Did you?

567
00:36:08.541 --> 00:36:10.668
You lifted it from Joyce. ma'am.

568
00:36:10.668 --> 00:36:13.671
Uh-ho. and he lifted it
from somewhere else.

569
00:36:13.671 --> 00:36:15.215
shitty little man that he is.

570
00:36:15.215 --> 00:36:17.008
Never a day's work in his life.

571
00:36:17.008 --> 00:36:19.094
Yeah. apart from the books.

572
00:36:19.094 --> 00:36:21.346
Terrible little syphilitic.

573
00:36:21.346 --> 00:36:23.181
Tricked an American.

574
00:36:23.181 --> 00:36:25.350
sometimes that's all
you have to do.

575
00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:26.643
Is that what you did?

576
00:36:26.643 --> 00:36:29.396
I've tricked any number
of Americans.

577
00:36:29.396 --> 00:36:33.483
including playing
pagan princesses.

578
00:36:33.483 --> 00:36:36.694
Elizabeth of England.
ruined widows

579
00:36:36.694 --> 00:36:41.157
and any number of flash-eyed
barefoot peasant girls.

580
00:36:41.157 --> 00:36:42.826
There's nothing to it.
all you need

581
00:36:42.826 --> 00:36:45.537
are regular features
and the ability to read.

582
00:36:45.537 --> 00:36:48.206
Oh. I very much doubt that.

583
00:36:52.043 --> 00:36:53.711
I spoke with my daughter.

584
00:36:53.711 --> 00:36:56.798
Surprisingly. she's not at all
interested in getting a divorce.

585
00:36:56.798 --> 00:36:59.259
- She loves her husband.
- No.

586
00:36:59.259 --> 00:37:02.554
But the arrangement suits her.

587
00:37:02.554 --> 00:37:05.890
Alcohol. waitresses
and her money.

588
00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:07.308
My money.

589
00:37:08.643 --> 00:37:12.814
She hired you to find
another swine. didn't she?

590
00:37:12.814 --> 00:37:16.359
Nico Peterson.
who doesn't want to be found.

591
00:37:16.359 --> 00:37:19.195
You learned
all of this from her. yeah?

592
00:37:19.195 --> 00:37:23.741
Ah! I want that tea strong
enough to trot a mouse on.

593
00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:30.498
Fine. done. you can go now.
I will be mother.

594
00:37:30.498 --> 00:37:32.125
Thank you. ma'am.

595
00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:39.424
I have also had the pleasure
of Mr. Peterson's company.

596
00:37:39.424 --> 00:37:41.885
he was proposing
certain investments.

597
00:37:41.885 --> 00:37:44.304
In the equitation
business. I presume.

598
00:37:44.304 --> 00:37:47.390
Whatever business.
I wasn't interested.

599
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:50.310
But my daughter cannot help

600
00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:53.271
but want what
she presumes I have.

601
00:37:53.271 --> 00:37:55.690
And you had Mr. Peterson?

602
00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:59.611
That was a presumption.
Mr. Marlowe.

603
00:37:59.611 --> 00:38:01.237
An understandable one.

604
00:38:01.237 --> 00:38:03.698
I'm sure my daughter's
paying you handsomely.

605
00:38:03.698 --> 00:38:06.367
I can't talk to you
about your daughter's business.

606
00:38:06.367 --> 00:38:11.623
What business do you think there
is in my family that isn't mine?

607
00:38:11.623 --> 00:38:15.793
If she thought I wanted you.
she'd have you too.

608
00:38:15.793 --> 00:38:19.923
Mm. Perhaps she already has.

609
00:38:19.923 --> 00:38:22.467
I can only say it again.
I'm not in a position

610
00:38:22.467 --> 00:38:24.802
to discuss your daughter's
business with you.

611
00:38:24.802 --> 00:38:29.557
You're a proud stubborn man.
Mr. Marlowe.

612
00:38:29.557 --> 00:38:31.893
I'm just an ordinary Joe

613
00:38:31.893 --> 00:38:34.854
trying to earn a buck
and stay out of jail.

614
00:38:39.108 --> 00:38:42.737
Clare's father drove his car
off a cliff in La Jolla

615
00:38:42.737 --> 00:38:45.490
before she was even born.

616
00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:49.994
He was in the oil business.
very successful.

617
00:38:49.994 --> 00:38:54.249
but he couldn't hide
from the black dog.

618
00:38:54.249 --> 00:38:58.378
It's the one thing that
frightens me. Mr. Marlowe.

619
00:38:58.378 --> 00:39:01.673
That hound.
it runs in families.

620
00:39:01.673 --> 00:39:03.883
You're afraid she's unstable?

621
00:39:03.883 --> 00:39:05.552
Oh. I know she is.

622
00:39:07.136 --> 00:39:09.264
So be careful. Mr. Marlowe.

623
00:39:09.264 --> 00:39:13.518
she has this burning need
for a father figure.

624
00:39:13.518 --> 00:39:15.937
You see. I had to pretend

625
00:39:15.937 --> 00:39:19.023
that she was my niece
all those years.

626
00:39:19.023 --> 00:39:22.694
My advisers thought that.
uh. a daughter...

627
00:39:24.028 --> 00:39:25.363
would age me.

628
00:39:25.363 --> 00:39:26.864
What advisers?

629
00:39:26.864 --> 00:39:31.369
You've met the soon to be
Ambassador to England.

630
00:39:31.369 --> 00:39:32.829
Mr. O'Reilly.

631
00:39:32.829 --> 00:39:35.540
And maybe
he advised me wrongly.

632
00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:39.335
but I had to listen
all those years.

633
00:39:39.335 --> 00:39:40.962
He even bought a studio.

634
00:39:40.962 --> 00:39:42.880
said it was to
advance my career.

635
00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:46.843
but it did no harm
to his bank balance.

636
00:39:46.843 --> 00:39:50.388
So. my daughter
had to be my niece...

637
00:39:50.388 --> 00:39:53.933
until at last even
I had to face the fact.

638
00:39:53.933 --> 00:39:55.852
The fact?

639
00:39:55.852 --> 00:40:00.857
That my game was up.
it had been for some time.

640
00:40:00.857 --> 00:40:05.486
No more barefoot colleens.
no more Ruritanian queens.

641
00:40:07.196 --> 00:40:10.992
I have more money
than the Queen of Sheba.

642
00:40:10.992 --> 00:40:14.078
and I'm a very. very.
very happy has-been.

643
00:40:14.078 --> 00:40:16.873
You mean a celluloid legend. surely.

644
00:40:16.873 --> 00:40:19.542
The key to Hollywood.
Mr. Marlowe.

645
00:40:19.542 --> 00:40:22.170
is knowing
when your game is up.

646
00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:26.716
Take the money and run.
or stay. if you want.

647
00:40:26.716 --> 00:40:28.760
But at least take the money.

648
00:40:30.803 --> 00:40:35.016
I had another investigator
on Mr. Peterson's case.

649
00:40:35.016 --> 00:40:37.477
a shamus. called Seamus.
if you can believe.

650
00:40:37.477 --> 00:40:39.187
What did he find?

651
00:40:39.187 --> 00:40:42.231
That besides being prop
master at Pacific Pictures.

652
00:40:42.231 --> 00:40:46.110
Nico was also a wannabe agent
with the client of one.

653
00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:48.946
Miss Amanda Toxteth.

654
00:40:48.946 --> 00:40:53.326
So you see. Mr. Marlowe.
my daughter wasn't the only one

655
00:40:53.326 --> 00:40:56.079
spreading her legs for him.

656
00:40:56.079 --> 00:40:59.582
So. if you find Mr. Peterson.
come to me before--

657
00:40:59.582 --> 00:41:03.044
Where would I find
Miss Toxteth?

658
00:41:03.044 --> 00:41:07.340
Don't know. some god-awful
B picture I suppose.

659
00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:10.927
- Ma'am.
- Wait. How dare you?

660
00:41:10.927 --> 00:41:14.806
I'm a little confused.
I've already been paid.

661
00:41:30.071 --> 00:41:32.657
Cut! Cut! Cut!

662
00:41:32.657 --> 00:41:34.575
I need to see the face.
the face.

663
00:41:34.575 --> 00:41:35.868
I need to see the face.

664
00:41:35.868 --> 00:41:39.163
Ama-- Amanda. uh.
camera's over there.

665
00:41:39.163 --> 00:41:40.790
I need you to look
at the camera.

666
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:43.543
Car rolls up.
you look at the cameras. okay?

667
00:41:43.543 --> 00:41:45.420
Thank you. Lunch.

668
00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:47.213
I can take this off. right?

669
00:41:47.213 --> 00:41:49.924
Man 3: Yes. After lunch.

670
00:41:49.924 --> 00:41:52.260
Believe me. I look better
without the war paint.

671
00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:55.179
Thanks for seeing me.
Miss Toxteth.

672
00:41:55.179 --> 00:41:58.015
Call me Mandy.
You're a detective?

673
00:41:58.015 --> 00:42:00.101
I'm more harmless than I look.

674
00:42:00.101 --> 00:42:02.979
That must be exciting.
being a detective.

675
00:42:02.979 --> 00:42:04.689
I can hardly contain myself.

676
00:42:04.689 --> 00:42:07.525
Oh. well. don't contain yourself
on my account.

677
00:42:07.525 --> 00:42:10.695
Nico Peterson
was your agent. yes?

678
00:42:10.695 --> 00:42:14.866
Well. he got me some work...

679
00:42:14.866 --> 00:42:17.368
"Riders of the Red Dawn."
did you see it?

680
00:42:17.368 --> 00:42:22.623
- Mm. not yet. no.
- Well. it's gone now.

681
00:42:22.623 --> 00:42:26.836
Joel McCrea was supposed to be
in it. but something happened.

682
00:42:26.836 --> 00:42:29.464
I play the rancher's wife.
who makes eyes at an Indian.

683
00:42:29.464 --> 00:42:31.048
and the Indian gets hanged.

684
00:42:31.048 --> 00:42:32.967
I'll catch it
when it comes round again.

685
00:42:34.302 --> 00:42:38.139
Acting seems to be going well.
Miss Toxteth.

686
00:42:38.139 --> 00:42:39.557
You're sweet.

687
00:42:39.557 --> 00:42:43.561
Actually. my mother says
I should fuck more producers.

688
00:42:43.561 --> 00:42:44.896
What do you think?

689
00:42:44.896 --> 00:42:48.733
I think your mother
is gravely mistaken.

690
00:42:50.318 --> 00:42:53.696
What can you tell me
about Nico Peterson?

691
00:42:53.696 --> 00:42:55.782
How deeply should my account
be detailed?

692
00:42:55.782 --> 00:42:57.909
Well. when did you
last see him?

693
00:42:59.076 --> 00:43:01.913
I guess a week before he died.

694
00:43:01.913 --> 00:43:04.248
He was trying to get back
into my good graces.

695
00:43:04.248 --> 00:43:08.628
- He was a womanizer. yes?
- That's a tricky question.

696
00:43:08.628 --> 00:43:11.339
Nico liked the conquest.
not the women.

697
00:43:11.339 --> 00:43:14.383
He'd hardly touch you
after he'd had you.

698
00:43:14.383 --> 00:43:16.135
That's a particular kind of man.

699
00:43:16.135 --> 00:43:18.805
Some girls say
handsome men are cold.

700
00:43:18.805 --> 00:43:20.389
that's normally just what
you say to ugly men

701
00:43:20.389 --> 00:43:24.852
to make them feel better.
but... Nico was cold.

702
00:43:26.354 --> 00:43:28.648
Nico had girlfriends.
but he didn't have

703
00:43:28.648 --> 00:43:30.775
girls who were friends.

704
00:43:30.775 --> 00:43:33.361
Do you know any of his
other girlfriends?

705
00:43:33.361 --> 00:43:36.197
Clare Quincannon
supposedly fell for him.

706
00:43:36.197 --> 00:43:39.242
The blonde with
the terrible mother.

707
00:43:39.242 --> 00:43:43.788
And the mother's story.
kept by the Ambassador.

708
00:43:43.788 --> 00:43:46.457
He even bought this
studio for her.

709
00:43:46.457 --> 00:43:49.669
I hear it's pure slavery.

710
00:43:49.669 --> 00:43:52.672
Did Nico have anything
to do with Mexico.

711
00:43:52.672 --> 00:43:54.966
business out of Mexico?

712
00:43:54.966 --> 00:43:57.844
There's only one
business out of Mexico.

713
00:43:57.844 --> 00:43:59.720
don't be a sweet chump.

714
00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:03.099
When he had money that was why.
and probably the only reason

715
00:44:03.099 --> 00:44:06.936
anybody would look for him.
owed money or a fix.

716
00:44:16.863 --> 00:44:18.990
What did he drive. Mister?

717
00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:21.200
- Who?
- Nico Peterson.

718
00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.911
Well. whatever he drove.
he ain't parking it here.

719
00:45:49.497 --> 00:45:50.790
You again?

720
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:52.541
It's alright.
I'm a friend of Nico's.

721
00:45:52.541 --> 00:45:55.503
- Philip Marlowe.
- You're much too persistent.

722
00:45:55.503 --> 00:45:58.130
- I'm trying to find Nico.
- He's dead.

723
00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:02.301
Wait a minute.
Are you so sure of that?

724
00:46:02.301 --> 00:46:05.221
I've been hired to look into
your brother's disappearance.

725
00:46:05.221 --> 00:46:07.974
He hasn't disappeared.
he's in a jar on a marble shelf.

726
00:46:07.974 --> 00:46:09.809
I had to buy it myself.

727
00:46:09.809 --> 00:46:12.103
You saw it. too.
should have known.

728
00:46:12.103 --> 00:46:14.939
What if I told you
he might be alive?

729
00:46:14.939 --> 00:46:17.900
I don't believe in
fairy tales. mister.

730
00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:22.071
I saw his body on
the gurney at the place.

731
00:46:22.071 --> 00:46:24.615
So it wasn't at
the club on the roadway.

732
00:46:24.615 --> 00:46:27.243
I did everything I had to.

733
00:46:27.243 --> 00:46:28.995
It couldn't have been
easy seeing him.

734
00:46:28.995 --> 00:46:32.289
Wasn't much fun. And what's
Floyd got against you?

735
00:46:32.289 --> 00:46:34.959
Why I wanted to meet.
and if you're afraid of him

736
00:46:34.959 --> 00:46:36.544
or anything. we have to talk.

737
00:46:36.544 --> 00:46:38.337
I'm not afraid of anything.

738
00:46:40.631 --> 00:46:42.842
- What's in the book?
- Words.

739
00:46:42.842 --> 00:46:44.260
No dope?

740
00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:47.263
Just words.
it's a book about words.

741
00:46:47.263 --> 00:46:51.183
- Nico was good with words.
- You say you saw his body?

742
00:46:51.183 --> 00:46:55.146
Yeah. And then the cop tried
to make me in the hallway.

743
00:46:56.772 --> 00:46:59.692
Probably has a daughter my age.

744
00:46:59.692 --> 00:47:02.319
It's funny. whatever you do.

745
00:47:02.319 --> 00:47:04.488
there is always someone
trying to make ya.

746
00:47:04.488 --> 00:47:05.823
Mm-hmm.

747
00:47:05.823 --> 00:47:10.327
You know what. fuck Floyd.
fuck cops and fuck you.

748
00:47:10.327 --> 00:47:13.956
I know the lady.
she's the punk's sister.

749
00:47:13.956 --> 00:47:16.625
but who are you?

750
00:47:16.625 --> 00:47:18.419
You are a big one.

751
00:47:18.419 --> 00:47:20.671
I'm thinking of
renting the place.

752
00:47:26.135 --> 00:47:27.636
Donde esta Serena?

753
00:47:27.636 --> 00:47:29.013
Who's Serena?

754
00:47:29.013 --> 00:47:32.224
If you know my brother.
he probably dumped her.

755
00:48:01.712 --> 00:48:03.964
Where's Serena?

756
00:48:03.964 --> 00:48:05.591
- Who's Serena?
- My brother is dead...

757
00:48:05.591 --> 00:48:06.634
Who's Serena?

758
00:48:06.634 --> 00:48:07.802
You take us to her

759
00:48:07.802 --> 00:48:09.345
or you'll see what happens.

760
00:48:24.568 --> 00:48:25.945
Please.

761
00:48:31.492 --> 00:48:34.411
Well. well.
what have we got here?

762
00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:45.589
Boss wants a word.

763
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:50.219
- And who might you be big guy?
- Cedric. big guy.

764
00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:53.514
Your boss's name?

765
00:48:53.514 --> 00:48:57.977
Oh. he's a little guy.
Lou Hendricks.

766
00:48:57.977 --> 00:48:59.311
Well. well...

767
00:49:00.604 --> 00:49:01.647
Get up.

768
00:49:06.944 --> 00:49:10.322
♪ Down the ol’ big sea wave ♪

769
00:49:11.949 --> 00:49:16.287
♪ I found a new baby ♪

770
00:49:16.287 --> 00:49:18.622
♪ A little baby ♪

771
00:49:30.926 --> 00:49:33.429
The Lou Hendricks.

772
00:49:33.429 --> 00:49:36.307
Finally. I need
no introduction.

773
00:49:36.307 --> 00:49:40.311
I'm a generic name. Cedric.
an eponymous trademark.

774
00:49:40.311 --> 00:49:42.438
You're a criminal.

775
00:49:42.438 --> 00:49:44.899
Businessman and philanthropist.

776
00:49:44.899 --> 00:49:47.902
I could use a few bucks.
take me away from all this.

777
00:49:47.902 --> 00:49:50.154
I was hoping you could use
a few bucks. Mr. Marlowe.

778
00:49:50.154 --> 00:49:52.990
but alas.
it will be transactional.

779
00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:55.367
not philanthropic.

780
00:49:55.367 --> 00:49:57.494
Well. what was
the words you wanted?

781
00:49:57.494 --> 00:50:00.247
I can only hope
it is not a past participle.

782
00:50:01.832 --> 00:50:04.293
Where's home. Mr. Marlowe?

783
00:50:04.293 --> 00:50:06.670
Where the heart is.
but you know that.

784
00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:11.175
No. I mean your actual.
quotidian home.

785
00:50:11.175 --> 00:50:14.970
26. Maple Boulevard.

786
00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:18.349
Let's take Mr. Marlowe to
his quotidian home. Cedric.

787
00:50:19.808 --> 00:50:24.647
The Elements of Style
by William Strunk Jr.

788
00:50:24.647 --> 00:50:28.275
A participle phrase at
the beginning of a sentence

789
00:50:28.275 --> 00:50:32.529
must refer to
the grammatical subject.

790
00:50:32.529 --> 00:50:36.533
Walking slowly down the road.
he saw a woman

791
00:50:36.533 --> 00:50:38.786
accompanied by two children.

792
00:50:40.829 --> 00:50:43.374
If you give any trouble...

793
00:50:43.374 --> 00:50:46.669
he will drop you
like a bad grammatical habit.

794
00:51:02.393 --> 00:51:06.730
Do you need to dress that?
Cedric. your do-rag.

795
00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:09.566
You mean my pocket square.
Mr. Hendricks?

796
00:51:09.566 --> 00:51:12.403
Some days. Cedric. I wish
I'd left you where I found you.

797
00:51:12.403 --> 00:51:15.572
- Give me the goddam thing.
- Thank you.

798
00:51:18.575 --> 00:51:22.204
I hear. Mr. Marlowe.
and from various connections.

799
00:51:22.204 --> 00:51:24.623
that you are
looking for someone.

800
00:51:24.623 --> 00:51:29.086
- We're all looking for someone.
- Oh. that's very sad.

801
00:51:30.421 --> 00:51:33.257
Tell me who I'm looking for.

802
00:51:33.257 --> 00:51:36.051
Let me guess.
two Mexes who are looking

803
00:51:36.051 --> 00:51:37.594
for a broad named Serena.

804
00:51:37.594 --> 00:51:43.392
Serena. a femme of the most
delicate shape imaginable.

805
00:51:43.392 --> 00:51:47.479
last seen in the arms of
one Nico Peterson.

806
00:51:47.479 --> 00:51:51.066
- Does that name ring a bell?
- A tinkle.

807
00:51:51.066 --> 00:51:52.735
I don't need you
to hear a tinkle.

808
00:51:52.735 --> 00:51:55.195
I need you to hear
a sonorous bell

809
00:51:55.195 --> 00:51:57.448
with a hunchback
swinging from it.

810
00:51:57.448 --> 00:52:03.370
gong-a-dong-a-dong.
not a tinkle. Mr. Marlowe.

811
00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:05.622
Who was chasing
Peterson's sister?

812
00:52:07.458 --> 00:52:09.335
Two beaners. I hear.

813
00:52:09.335 --> 00:52:13.630
Maladroits from sunnier climes.
the land of banana

814
00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:16.342
and tarantula. who were also.
quite separately.

815
00:52:16.342 --> 00:52:18.802
and I should like you
to notice that.

816
00:52:18.802 --> 00:52:20.471
looking for her brother.

817
00:52:20.471 --> 00:52:25.142
I would very much appreciate
a word with our friend Nico.

818
00:52:25.142 --> 00:52:28.729
if you find him
and I will pay you.

819
00:52:28.729 --> 00:52:30.647
Tell me what Nico
was involved in

820
00:52:30.647 --> 00:52:34.443
and why he faked
his death and ran.

821
00:52:34.443 --> 00:52:38.906
Nico. in the end.
had to avoid everybody. I think.

822
00:52:40.616 --> 00:52:43.660
But I will tell you that
he used to run errands for me.

823
00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:46.163
down in the land
of the sombrero.

824
00:52:46.163 --> 00:52:48.665
the serape and the mule.

825
00:52:48.665 --> 00:52:51.502
His Spanish was good.
he was dark

826
00:52:51.502 --> 00:52:54.421
in a Latin lover kind of way.

827
00:52:54.421 --> 00:52:56.090
He was useful in Mexico.

828
00:52:56.090 --> 00:53:01.303
Is it bananas or tarantulas
you import. Mr. Hendricks?

829
00:53:01.303 --> 00:53:03.222
Tarantulas.

830
00:53:03.222 --> 00:53:06.517
I'm entirely
composed of tarantulas.

831
00:53:06.517 --> 00:53:10.938
- And me afraid of spiders.
- Nico worked for me.

832
00:53:10.938 --> 00:53:13.399
He would bring me items
so hard to come by up here

833
00:53:13.399 --> 00:53:15.442
where the laws are so strict.

834
00:53:15.442 --> 00:53:17.486
At the time of
his supposed death.

835
00:53:17.486 --> 00:53:21.782
he was in possession
of some of those items.

836
00:53:21.782 --> 00:53:23.992
And these items are?

837
00:53:23.992 --> 00:53:25.661
There are items and items

838
00:53:25.661 --> 00:53:29.415
and one item that
related to the said items.

839
00:53:29.415 --> 00:53:31.375
Why don't we take a ride
to the Corbata Club?

840
00:53:31.375 --> 00:53:33.377
Maybe he stashed
the items there.

841
00:53:33.377 --> 00:53:37.214
Mr. Marlowe. people will talk.

842
00:53:37.214 --> 00:53:40.384
When I go.
I go into the back entrance.

843
00:53:40.384 --> 00:53:42.010
Please leave that remark alone.

844
00:53:42.010 --> 00:53:46.557
- Wouldn't touch it.
- I grease the Corbata.

845
00:53:46.557 --> 00:53:48.725
Beneath this
fine Charvet shirt

846
00:53:48.725 --> 00:53:51.311
there is nothing but grease.

847
00:53:51.311 --> 00:53:54.815
Peterson would've needed help.
he would've needed a body.

848
00:53:54.815 --> 00:53:56.817
It has conspiracy
written all over it.

849
00:53:56.817 --> 00:54:00.028
I don't think Nico went
to a graveyard with a shovel

850
00:54:00.028 --> 00:54:04.408
and a lamp looking for a stiff
to fit his tuxedo. do you?

851
00:54:04.408 --> 00:54:06.702
The club was in
on the conspiracy.

852
00:54:06.702 --> 00:54:09.204
but what's the club's interest?

853
00:54:09.204 --> 00:54:10.789
Ask your client.

854
00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:14.585
I think you'll keep
looking for Peterson.

855
00:54:14.585 --> 00:54:18.338
client or not.
because you can't stop.

856
00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:23.635
But I'll pay you a thousand
just to sweeten the pot.

857
00:54:24.845 --> 00:54:28.223
No. Cedric. uh.
next street on the right.

858
00:54:28.223 --> 00:54:29.850
Pull over. please.

859
00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:35.772
It would be wise to
reconsider. Mr. Marlowe.

860
00:54:40.444 --> 00:54:42.821
Stop anywhere here. Cedric.

861
00:54:48.952 --> 00:54:51.830
26. Maple Boulevard.

862
00:54:51.830 --> 00:54:54.166
and I am not so smart
as they think I am.

863
00:54:54.166 --> 00:54:57.794
- You're welcome to come inside.
- They give you back your badge?

864
00:54:57.794 --> 00:55:01.089
No. I'm here to report
a kidnapping.

865
00:55:01.089 --> 00:55:05.344
If you find him. I will know.
and then I'll come get him.

866
00:55:05.344 --> 00:55:09.598
And when that happens.
don't try to stand in the way.

867
00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:14.978
Thanks. Cedric.

868
00:55:14.978 --> 00:55:17.147
So two Mexes came out
of nowhere and kidnapped

869
00:55:17.147 --> 00:55:18.649
this broad. is that what
you're telling me?

870
00:55:18.649 --> 00:55:20.984
That's what I'm telling
you. that and that

871
00:55:20.984 --> 00:55:23.820
she turns tricks
at the Corbata Club

872
00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:27.991
and identified as her brother a
stiff who wasn't Nico Peterson.

873
00:55:27.991 --> 00:55:31.495
Yeah. there are certain things
I'm just not gonna hear.

874
00:55:31.495 --> 00:55:33.038
They were looking
for another broad.

875
00:55:33.038 --> 00:55:35.832
someone they called Serena.

876
00:55:35.832 --> 00:55:37.251
I'm not here.

877
00:55:37.251 --> 00:55:39.211
His sister was kidnapped.

878
00:55:39.211 --> 00:55:41.964
You don't put it in the system.
I'll go and make a report.

879
00:55:41.964 --> 00:55:44.800
I'll go on the record.
I'll spill that Peterson

880
00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:47.344
wasn't Peterson. and that's
not news. that's a feature.

881
00:55:47.344 --> 00:55:50.931
I can never remember which
newspaper hates the mayor most.

882
00:55:50.931 --> 00:55:53.809
This will all go okay if you
don't manipulate me. okay?

883
00:55:53.809 --> 00:55:55.852
What we do.
we get you out of here.

884
00:55:55.852 --> 00:55:58.188
I take a call from
an anonymous citizen

885
00:55:58.188 --> 00:56:00.023
who saw her put in the car.

886
00:56:00.023 --> 00:56:03.527
And you. play nice. or I'll put
you at the scene as a suspect.

887
00:56:03.527 --> 00:56:04.903
It ain't what happened.
it's what I type.

888
00:56:04.903 --> 00:56:06.405
Deal.

889
00:56:06.405 --> 00:56:08.740
I'll give your pal Bernie
Ohls the dope off the record.

890
00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:10.867
Sheriff's detectives.
I can start everybody looking

891
00:56:10.867 --> 00:56:12.703
for her and they'll look hard.

892
00:56:12.703 --> 00:56:14.538
Is this good enough for you?

893
00:56:14.538 --> 00:56:17.666
- They took my .38.
- Yeah.

894
00:56:21.044 --> 00:56:23.714
There's your .38. if someone
gets killed with your .38.

895
00:56:23.714 --> 00:56:26.383
you still have a .38.

896
00:56:26.383 --> 00:56:29.136
If they ever make us record
serial numbers. it'll be fucked.

897
00:56:34.891 --> 00:56:36.059
Marlowe?

898
00:56:38.186 --> 00:56:41.857
- Detective Bernie Ohls.
- Wait in the car. Arthur.

899
00:56:41.857 --> 00:56:45.068
- Get us a drink. Marlowe.
- Scotch on the rocks.

900
00:56:48.405 --> 00:56:51.658
- She's being looked for?
- City. Sheriffs. everybody.

901
00:56:52.576 --> 00:56:54.077
Not a peep out of the brass.

902
00:56:56.246 --> 00:56:59.082
Once a bulletin goes out
nobody can kill her.

903
00:56:59.082 --> 00:57:02.169
all car alert
for Lynn Peterson.

904
00:57:02.169 --> 00:57:06.506
Mexicans driving some
sort of Tijuana spray job.

905
00:57:06.506 --> 00:57:08.800
She'll get no different
than anybody else.

906
00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:11.637
Just really look for her.
I lost her.

907
00:57:13.805 --> 00:57:16.933
When you're getting to be
an old timer.

908
00:57:16.933 --> 00:57:19.019
it's okay to get out alive.

909
00:57:19.019 --> 00:57:21.938
I rely on you to give me
good example. Marlowe.

910
00:57:27.444 --> 00:57:29.738
Who's the frail across the way?

911
00:57:29.738 --> 00:57:31.782
Nothing frail about her. Bernie.

912
00:57:40.248 --> 00:57:45.837
Well. lay low and. uh.
consider another profession.

913
00:57:57.724 --> 00:58:00.102
- Goodnight. miss.
- Goodnight. detective.

914
00:58:07.317 --> 00:58:08.735
Hey.

915
00:58:10.987 --> 00:58:14.491
- Who hurt you?
- Mexicans looking for Peterson.

916
00:58:14.491 --> 00:58:18.870
- What were they looking for?
- For God's sakes. you tell me.

917
00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:27.337
- Coat?
- Thank you.

918
00:58:39.683 --> 00:58:41.393
One could live in
a house like this

919
00:58:41.393 --> 00:58:43.854
and so much would fall away.

920
00:58:43.854 --> 00:58:47.774
That's how the other half lives
and we do pretty good.

921
00:58:51.945 --> 00:58:58.827
Clare. you haven't once told me
why you really want Nico.

922
00:58:58.827 --> 00:59:01.747
Amanda Toxteth claims
that he wasn't

923
00:59:01.747 --> 00:59:04.708
especially thoughtful
in the bedroom.

924
00:59:06.209 --> 00:59:10.255
Poor Amanda.
she played a tough game.

925
00:59:11.339 --> 00:59:14.217
Tell me about it.

926
00:59:14.217 --> 00:59:17.053
There's not one studio in
this town that's run by men

927
00:59:17.053 --> 00:59:20.682
who were looked at twice before
they had their first million.

928
00:59:23.185 --> 00:59:25.896
If women never liked you
when you were poor.

929
00:59:25.896 --> 00:59:28.315
that must twist you all up.

930
00:59:28.315 --> 00:59:32.235
So they call you forth for
refreshing acts of humiliation.

931
00:59:32.235 --> 00:59:35.238
Who did you learn
this from? The Ambassador?

932
00:59:35.238 --> 00:59:38.909
Mm. the Ambassador got to
town already loaded...

933
00:59:38.909 --> 00:59:43.330
and he'll be even richer when he
leaves. just without my mother.

934
00:59:43.330 --> 00:59:45.081
Your mother also wanted Nico.

935
00:59:46.792 --> 00:59:48.335
She tried to hire you too?

936
00:59:50.587 --> 00:59:55.300
She always wants
what I want or have.

937
00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:57.344
You mean Nico?

938
00:59:57.344 --> 01:00:01.932
Maybe. or maybe she's just
afraid that you'll make love

939
01:00:01.932 --> 01:00:05.852
to me before you find out
just how terrible I am.

940
01:00:05.852 --> 01:00:07.646
That's a terrible idea.

941
01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:11.566
- Why?
- Why?

942
01:00:11.566 --> 01:00:15.821
Because I'm in your employ.
because you're half my age.

943
01:00:17.948 --> 01:00:21.827
Because you're so beautiful
I'd lose my bearings.

944
01:00:26.915 --> 01:00:30.293
What can we do then.
if we can't do that?

945
01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:37.342
We can dance.

946
01:00:43.181 --> 01:00:45.350
I spent six years
with the nuns.

947
01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:48.478
just so my mother could
be a flash-eyed colleen

948
01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:50.814
with her hands on her hips.

949
01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:55.318
She had to play the virgin
for 15 years. gosh.

950
01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:59.239
Although you surrender
in each picture. naturally.

951
01:00:59.239 --> 01:01:01.616
Then all the while.
the ambassador

952
01:01:01.616 --> 01:01:05.161
was advising her financially.

953
01:01:06.872 --> 01:01:10.834
Has he ever advised
you financially?

954
01:01:10.834 --> 01:01:12.711
You mean has he ever touched me?

955
01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:15.755
Suppose I do.

956
01:01:17.757 --> 01:01:19.384
Maybe that's the wrong question.

957
01:01:20.927 --> 01:01:22.387
- Oh!
- Pardon me.

958
01:01:22.387 --> 01:01:25.557
You're a terrible dancer.

959
01:01:25.557 --> 01:01:27.517
I'm a worse lover.

960
01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:29.436
You expect me to believe that?

961
01:01:36.151 --> 01:01:39.446
- The dance is good.
- For now.

962
01:01:44.242 --> 01:01:47.954
I have to be somewhere.

963
01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:57.881
Should I come back here after?
Stay over as friends?

964
01:01:57.881 --> 01:02:00.550
That never works. Clare.

965
01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:02.344
I don't intend it to.

966
01:02:06.806 --> 01:02:07.974
No.

967
01:02:10.477 --> 01:02:12.270
A puzzle has many pieces.

968
01:02:14.189 --> 01:02:16.900
I don't know exactly
what you're gonna find...

969
01:02:18.944 --> 01:02:21.237
you might find a dragon
and have to kill it.

970
01:02:22.781 --> 01:02:24.407
- Fair enough.
- Mm.

971
01:02:32.457 --> 01:02:36.336
- Goodnight. Philip Marlowe.
- 'Night.

972
01:02:36.336 --> 01:02:38.672
♪ At the moon ♪

973
01:02:38.672 --> 01:02:44.803
♪ But I'll be seeing you ♪

974
01:02:50.684 --> 01:02:57.399
♪ I'll be seeing you ♪

975
01:04:49.177 --> 01:04:51.554
Is the ambassador here?
Woman 1: Yes. ma'am.

976
01:04:55.475 --> 01:04:57.602
So do we call you
ambassador now?

977
01:04:57.602 --> 01:05:00.105
Clare. how are you?
It's good to see you.

978
01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:04.400
- Your mother just left.
- What did she want?

979
01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.653
- Don't ask.
- So it didn't go well?

980
01:05:12.325 --> 01:05:15.078
Where's your camera.
Mr. Marlowe?

981
01:05:15.078 --> 01:05:16.121
I don't have one.

982
01:05:16.121 --> 01:05:17.997
Mm. do you have any idea

983
01:05:17.997 --> 01:05:19.874
how much that photo
would've been worth?

984
01:05:19.874 --> 01:05:24.254
- Are they breaking any laws?
- Only the laws of attraction.

985
01:05:25.672 --> 01:05:29.509
I. for one. would pay
big money for an account

986
01:05:29.509 --> 01:05:32.095
of all of their
terms of endearment.

987
01:05:34.264 --> 01:05:36.766
He's old enough
to be her father.

988
01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:38.017
Yeah.

989
01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:43.648
But then. so are you.

990
01:05:53.741 --> 01:05:55.368
There goes Bernie Ohls.

991
01:05:58.037 --> 01:06:00.874
Arthur ran the number plate
of your visitor last night.

992
01:06:00.874 --> 01:06:02.625
Yeah.

993
01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:06.629
That car belongs
to Dorothy Quincannon.

994
01:06:06.629 --> 01:06:08.631
- So?
- So?

995
01:06:08.631 --> 01:06:11.634
Of all the people in Los Angeles
who you do not fuck with.

996
01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:14.470
the new ambassador who opened
the Pacific Studios

997
01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:18.183
with bootleg money and his
mistress are top of the list!

998
01:06:21.436 --> 01:06:23.438
Everybody's better
connected than us.

999
01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:27.066
Ever wonder what
the attraction was?

1000
01:06:28.401 --> 01:06:30.904
What. the mother
or the daughter?

1001
01:06:30.904 --> 01:06:32.155
Maybe both.

1002
01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:37.327
You are a very sick man. Marlowe.

1003
01:06:44.667 --> 01:06:47.295
LAPD found Lynn Peterson.

1004
01:06:51.174 --> 01:06:53.426
- Where is she?
- Encino.

1005
01:06:55.053 --> 01:06:57.013
She'll wait till we get there.

1006
01:07:01.809 --> 01:07:04.520
Was she. um. was she shot
with my gun?

1007
01:07:05.897 --> 01:07:07.357
No.

1008
01:07:09.067 --> 01:07:10.777
No. she wasn't shot.

1009
01:07:28.711 --> 01:07:31.172
Man 4: Deep continuous
transverse wound

1010
01:07:31.172 --> 01:07:33.800
to the anterior
triangles of the neck.

1011
01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:36.719
cutting both venous
and arterial structures.

1012
01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:39.472
Injuries not
compatible with life.

1013
01:07:39.472 --> 01:07:41.140
That means her throat was cut.

1014
01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:42.850
Man 4: That was after
the lit cigarettes.

1015
01:07:42.850 --> 01:07:45.687
the knuckle dusters.
the knife. the rape.

1016
01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:48.398
Oh. my God.

1017
01:08:01.536 --> 01:08:04.247
Guys. you're not
gonna like this.

1018
01:08:14.757 --> 01:08:16.467
- Hey. you!
- Yeah?

1019
01:08:16.467 --> 01:08:19.304
That's the sister of the man
you identified two weeks ago

1020
01:08:19.304 --> 01:08:21.597
who was killed outside
the Corbata Club.

1021
01:08:21.597 --> 01:08:24.058
His head was squashed
like a pumpkin.

1022
01:08:24.058 --> 01:08:25.435
Were you aware of that?

1023
01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:26.894
Make a note of it
in your report. doc.

1024
01:08:26.894 --> 01:08:29.897
- I just do the bodies.
- Just make a note of it.

1025
01:08:29.897 --> 01:08:33.860
- Thank you. Bernie.
- Nobody lives forever.

1026
01:08:36.654 --> 01:08:39.949
When things get down and dirty.
rank and file don't like it.

1027
01:08:39.949 --> 01:08:43.619
- Not even in county.
- At last. Bernie.

1028
01:08:45.872 --> 01:08:48.583
Joe? Come with us.

1029
01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:54.672
The blue car
came in an hour ago.

1030
01:08:54.672 --> 01:08:58.426
the two suspects
from Tijuana got out.

1031
01:08:58.426 --> 01:09:02.680
That's the re-spray.
Yep. Who's that?

1032
01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:05.475
That's the Bentley of
Mr. Lou Hendricks.

1033
01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:07.560
- The Lou Hendricks.
- The same.

1034
01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:10.646
So he's a member.
like the Mexicans.

1035
01:09:10.646 --> 01:09:12.315
I want you to go
after these fucks

1036
01:09:12.315 --> 01:09:14.275
like a rat terrier in a closet.

1037
01:09:14.275 --> 01:09:15.735
I don't wanna know
anything about it.

1038
01:09:15.735 --> 01:09:17.320
Ah. come on. Bernie.
do it yourself.

1039
01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:20.615
I still have a pension.
you don't.

1040
01:09:20.615 --> 01:09:22.033
Fair enough.

1041
01:09:22.033 --> 01:09:24.744
We own Bay Canyon. we'll block
the roads in and out.

1042
01:09:24.744 --> 01:09:26.621
Give me the glasses.

1043
01:09:26.621 --> 01:09:29.165
- Get down that rat hole.
- How?

1044
01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:32.502
- Doesn't matter how.
- Fair enough.

1045
01:09:32.502 --> 01:09:35.254
Come on. Joe. let's do this.

1046
01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:47.266
- You look like shit.
- Fair enough.

1047
01:09:47.266 --> 01:09:50.061
Just so you know. the real shit
doesn't go down in there until

1048
01:09:50.061 --> 01:09:55.233
the early hours. so once you're
in. you gotta wait and wait.

1049
01:09:55.233 --> 01:09:57.819
Fair enough.

1050
01:09:57.819 --> 01:10:01.030
And remember. you're the guy
who can ID the Mexicans.

1051
01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:03.157
so watch your corners.

1052
01:10:03.157 --> 01:10:04.575
Fair enough.

1053
01:10:04.575 --> 01:10:07.245
Hey. will this
get my badge back?

1054
01:10:08.287 --> 01:10:09.789
Is that what you want?

1055
01:10:12.125 --> 01:10:13.418
You mind?

1056
01:10:57.253 --> 01:10:59.547
- Otis!
- Yes. ma'am?

1057
01:10:59.547 --> 01:11:01.966
I'll be right down.
Yes. ma'am.

1058
01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:09.599
You're a long. long way
from Tipperary. Dorothy.

1059
01:11:42.924 --> 01:11:44.091
What is this called?

1060
01:11:44.091 --> 01:11:47.720
It's called a Miguel Finn.
a Mickey Finn.

1061
01:12:53.744 --> 01:12:58.708
Girls. boys. heroin. coke.

1062
01:12:58.708 --> 01:13:00.459
I've given it some thought.

1063
01:13:00.459 --> 01:13:02.503
and I'd like to fill out
an application.

1064
01:13:03.921 --> 01:13:05.339
Not polite.

1065
01:13:05.339 --> 01:13:07.592
Maybe because I don't feel
polite this fine evening.

1066
01:13:07.592 --> 01:13:09.719
Well. let's have a drink.
talk about it.

1067
01:13:09.719 --> 01:13:12.972
- You heard about Lynn Peterson?
- Tragic thing.

1068
01:13:12.972 --> 01:13:14.807
What if I told you that
the police won't touch you.

1069
01:13:14.807 --> 01:13:16.976
but they're expecting
that I will.

1070
01:13:18.436 --> 01:13:21.897
I have nothing to do with
Lynn Peterson or Nico Peterson.

1071
01:13:23.899 --> 01:13:27.570
This is Los Angeles.
people are on the make.

1072
01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:29.322
Why were they here on the make?

1073
01:13:29.322 --> 01:13:32.533
His sister was a Cabana whore
with a junk habit.

1074
01:13:32.533 --> 01:13:34.243
she worked for you.
you're a pimp.

1075
01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:37.121
No. I'm not. I don't control
the place. I'm not the boss.

1076
01:13:37.121 --> 01:13:39.081
So who is?

1077
01:13:39.081 --> 01:13:42.084
Dorothy Quincannon?
The Ambassador?

1078
01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:43.961
How little you know.
Mr. Marlowe.

1079
01:13:43.961 --> 01:13:46.922
I do know a guy
named Lou Hendricks.

1080
01:13:46.922 --> 01:13:50.635
- You might know him too.
- His people call my people.

1081
01:13:50.635 --> 01:13:52.428
I'm going down
the rabbit hole. Floyd.

1082
01:13:52.428 --> 01:13:53.971
I might even take you with me.

1083
01:13:55.264 --> 01:13:57.808
We'll need that drink then.

1084
01:13:57.808 --> 01:14:00.019
We can join
Lou Hendricks down below.

1085
01:14:00.019 --> 01:14:03.105
Beating you round the walls
doesn't get me much does it?

1086
01:14:03.105 --> 01:14:06.108
- Must be the military training.
- Huh?

1087
01:14:06.108 --> 01:14:11.072
- Okay. I'll have that drink.
- It's. uh. very difficult.

1088
01:14:11.072 --> 01:14:14.033
To balance your many obligations
to the various interests

1089
01:14:14.033 --> 01:14:16.452
of all the people.
powerful people.

1090
01:14:16.452 --> 01:14:19.622
Discretion is a thing
that we provide.

1091
01:14:19.622 --> 01:14:21.791
And you take protection
in return.

1092
01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:26.629
Very. very serious protection.
Mr. Marlowe.

1093
01:14:30.007 --> 01:14:32.635
Now you will know
the full extent of it.

1094
01:14:32.635 --> 01:14:35.596
I appreciate your
difficulties. Mr. Hanson.

1095
01:14:35.596 --> 01:14:38.474
It's difficult to run a whore
house and not have anyone know

1096
01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:41.644
it is one... especially
when you're also

1097
01:14:41.644 --> 01:14:44.355
in the narcotics business.

1098
01:14:44.355 --> 01:14:46.816
There's an awful lot
you don't understand.

1099
01:14:46.816 --> 01:14:49.944
About narcotics?
About management.

1100
01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:55.783
The Corbata Club investors
leave me alone to.

1101
01:14:55.783 --> 01:14:57.827
to manage the place.

1102
01:14:57.827 --> 01:15:01.163
Now. I don't trouble them
when difficulties arise.

1103
01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:05.835
unless the difficulties are.
how shall we say.

1104
01:15:05.835 --> 01:15:07.712
hard for me to deal with alone.

1105
01:15:14.719 --> 01:15:18.514
Like the whore
who won't play ball.

1106
01:15:18.514 --> 01:15:22.935
the girl or a boy who aren't
as interested as you'd like.

1107
01:15:26.188 --> 01:15:29.608
Or the snoop
who's far too interested.

1108
01:15:31.235 --> 01:15:33.529
You give them
a little something?

1109
01:15:37.324 --> 01:15:39.535
Are you alright. Mr. Marlowe?

1110
01:15:43.956 --> 01:15:47.168
I would've thought you'd be a
man who could hold his liquor.

1111
01:15:48.502 --> 01:15:50.045
Seems I was wrong.

1112
01:15:56.385 --> 01:15:59.847
As you go to sleep.
I want you to consider...

1113
01:16:02.308 --> 01:16:07.521
the whereabouts of Nico Peterson
were never the issue.

1114
01:16:07.521 --> 01:16:11.901
it was the whereabouts of what
Nico had in his possession.

1115
01:16:11.901 --> 01:16:15.988
We'll get to the bottom of
those issues without your help.

1116
01:16:15.988 --> 01:16:19.950
From everything I hear.
you were never a team player.

1117
01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:24.246
never went along to get along
and see where it gets you?

1118
01:16:26.248 --> 01:16:28.709

Damn.

1138
01:18:44.011 --> 01:18:45.721
You're awake?

1139
01:18:52.227 --> 01:18:55.648
- This must be yours.
- You didn't drink it?

1140
01:18:55.648 --> 01:18:58.192
I remembered what happened
to Alice in Wonderland

1141
01:18:58.192 --> 01:19:00.486
when she bit the mushroom.

1142
01:19:00.486 --> 01:19:02.571
- You pretended.
- And you?

1143
01:19:02.571 --> 01:19:06.659
Should've known. who offers
the wheels a cocktail?

1144
01:19:06.659 --> 01:19:08.452
Lou Hendricks?

1145
01:19:08.452 --> 01:19:10.245
They're working him
over real bad.

1146
01:19:10.245 --> 01:19:13.248
That's him shackled up
inside I guess?

1147
01:19:13.248 --> 01:19:15.417
They'll have him
speaking Greek soon.

1148
01:19:37.898 --> 01:19:39.984
Promise you never
do that to me.

1149
01:19:42.277 --> 01:19:44.780
If I help you out of here...

1150
01:19:46.073 --> 01:19:47.908
will you help me?

1151
01:19:50.285 --> 01:19:51.787
Fuck yeah.

1152
01:19:56.667 --> 01:19:58.377
Crank up the volume.

1153
01:20:00.295 --> 01:20:02.840
Two dead boys from Tijuana.

1154
01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:05.342
See where this gets ya?

1155
01:20:05.342 --> 01:20:07.011
You're making this hard
for me. Lou.

1156
01:20:14.518 --> 01:20:16.979
Much too hard.

1157
01:20:16.979 --> 01:20:19.148
What else do you do
for Lou Hendricks?

1158
01:20:19.148 --> 01:20:21.316
Too damn much if you ask me.

1159
01:20:30.659 --> 01:20:32.369
Sweet.

1160
01:20:32.369 --> 01:20:34.246
Oh. righteous.

1161
01:20:35.539 --> 01:20:38.709
Hey. we both go in there...

1162
01:20:38.709 --> 01:20:41.503
we're both coming
out alive. yeah?

1163
01:20:41.503 --> 01:20:43.714
Agreed. Mr. Marlowe.

1164
01:20:52.014 --> 01:20:55.601
I'm getting
awfully sick of this tune.

1165
01:20:59.855 --> 01:21:01.857
Where is she?

1166
01:21:01.857 --> 01:21:03.984
Where is who?

1167
01:21:03.984 --> 01:21:05.694
The Chiquita bitch!

1168
01:21:05.694 --> 01:21:07.112
The one that you call Serena!

1169
01:21:07.112 --> 01:21:10.199
I already told you.
Nico had his way with her.

1170
01:21:10.199 --> 01:21:11.909
Well. what do you
do with this?

1171
01:21:13.118 --> 01:21:15.704
It's just for shaving.

1172
01:21:15.704 --> 01:21:17.873
Ear. nose and throat jobs. huh?

1173
01:21:17.873 --> 01:21:20.084
I have people
who do that for me.

1174
01:21:20.084 --> 01:21:21.919
Oh. do you?
Oh. so do I!

1175
01:21:21.919 --> 01:21:23.879
So do I!

1176
01:21:23.879 --> 01:21:26.298
Frederick!
Yeah!

1177
01:21:26.298 --> 01:21:29.176
Give him an ear and nose
and throat job. in that order.

1178
01:21:31.053 --> 01:21:34.014
Make him tell us
where Serena is.

1179
01:21:34.014 --> 01:21:35.474
Not Serena!

1180
01:21:37.059 --> 01:21:38.769
The Serena!

1181
01:21:38.769 --> 01:21:40.395
The Serena?

1182
01:21:40.395 --> 01:21:43.232
The Serena Ornamental
over there!

1183
01:21:52.074 --> 01:21:53.575
A plaster mermaid?

1184
01:21:55.035 --> 01:21:56.787
Serena's a fucking mermaid?

1185
01:21:56.787 --> 01:21:58.622
You gotta work on your Spanish!

1186
01:21:58.622 --> 01:21:59.915
Hanson!

1187
01:22:02.751 --> 01:22:04.378
Say this in Spanish!

1188
01:22:10.676 --> 01:22:11.885
Cedric!

1189
01:22:13.887 --> 01:22:15.889
Cedric. catch it!

1190
01:22:18.559 --> 01:22:20.060
Cedric!

1191
01:22:21.687 --> 01:22:23.272
Yes. boss.

1192
01:22:23.272 --> 01:22:28.777
Was it beyond your capabilities
to save the fucking mermaid?

1193
01:22:28.777 --> 01:22:30.362
Sorry. boss.

1194
01:22:30.362 --> 01:22:34.408
You just broke the
Hendricks bank!

1195
01:22:34.408 --> 01:22:35.576
Sorry. boss.

1196
01:22:35.576 --> 01:22:38.912
It'll take you years
to pay me back!

1197
01:22:38.912 --> 01:22:40.789
Mr. Hendricks...

1198
01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:42.249
that's not fair.

1199
01:22:42.249 --> 01:22:45.377
As the progeny
of sharecroppers. Cedric.

1200
01:22:45.377 --> 01:22:49.423
you should know life isn't fair!

1201
01:22:54.845 --> 01:22:56.221
You're right.

1202
01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:01.643
Life isn't fair.

1203
01:23:05.522 --> 01:23:09.610
I expected to
see grease. didn't you?

1204
01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:11.195
Grease and tarantulas.

1205
01:23:15.157 --> 01:23:18.660
But instead. he's entirely
made of soft tissue.

1206
01:23:20.037 --> 01:23:21.205
Go figure.

1207
01:23:23.498 --> 01:23:24.416
Shall we?

1208
01:23:24.416 --> 01:23:29.087
♪ I've found a new baby ♪

1209
01:23:29.087 --> 01:23:32.174
♪ Down the ol' big sea wave ♪

1210
01:23:34.176 --> 01:23:38.680
♪ I've found a new baby ♪

1211
01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:41.767
♪ A new baby ♪

1212
01:23:44.686 --> 01:23:46.313
♪ Oh ♪

1213
01:23:51.401 --> 01:23:53.737
What will I find inside?

1214
01:23:53.737 --> 01:23:55.697
Some dead bodies.

1215
01:23:55.697 --> 01:23:57.366
How many?

1216
01:23:57.366 --> 01:23:59.368
I forgot to count.

1217
01:23:59.368 --> 01:24:01.536
Uh. Lou Hendricks.

1218
01:24:01.536 --> 01:24:05.165
Floyd Hanson.
two gentlemen from Tijuana.

1219
01:24:05.165 --> 01:24:07.876
And one busted mermaid.

1220
01:24:07.876 --> 01:24:09.044
A mermaid?

1221
01:24:09.044 --> 01:24:11.004
The Serena Ornamental.

1222
01:24:11.004 --> 01:24:12.714
Packed with Mexican powder.

1223
01:24:13.632 --> 01:24:15.717
Now. very wet.

1224
01:24:15.717 --> 01:24:17.302
And you are?

1225
01:24:18.637 --> 01:24:20.055
I'm his wheels.

1226
01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:29.064
Huh.

1227
01:24:30.399 --> 01:24:32.567
So what now. Cedric?

1228
01:24:32.567 --> 01:24:35.404
We both spilled
some significant blood.

1229
01:24:35.404 --> 01:24:37.489
So we should stick together.

1230
01:24:37.489 --> 01:24:40.284
I'll be your driver
for the moment.

1231
01:24:40.284 --> 01:24:44.079
Cedric.
I have my own wheels.

1232
01:24:44.079 --> 01:24:46.039
Of course you do...

1233
01:24:46.039 --> 01:24:47.624
but consider the parking.

1234
01:25:05.809 --> 01:25:07.269
Well. well...

1235
01:25:07.269 --> 01:25:09.438
if it isn't Mr. Nico Peterson.

1236
01:25:12.065 --> 01:25:14.234
So...

1237
01:25:14.234 --> 01:25:16.028
you're not dead.

1238
01:25:16.028 --> 01:25:18.238
You're quite the detective.

1239
01:25:18.238 --> 01:25:20.615
What do you want?

1240
01:25:20.615 --> 01:25:25.287
You've been looking into the
circumstances of my demise.

1241
01:25:25.287 --> 01:25:27.706
My determination for
some time has been that

1242
01:25:27.706 --> 01:25:31.293
reports of your death
were greatly exaggerated.

1243
01:25:32.294 --> 01:25:33.795
I'll say.

1244
01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:35.464
But not your sisters.

1245
01:25:35.464 --> 01:25:40.969
My half-sister's. from my
fathers wild days in Acapulco.

1246
01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:44.139
So you won't
be spilling any tears?

1247
01:25:44.139 --> 01:25:46.600
She is dead. I know.

1248
01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:48.685
She did not die pleasantly.

1249
01:25:50.145 --> 01:25:51.563
I couldn't help that.

1250
01:25:51.563 --> 01:25:53.106
You could help yourself though.

1251
01:25:53.106 --> 01:25:57.986
Well. I happen to have
something everybody wants.

1252
01:25:57.986 --> 01:25:59.821
More dope?

1253
01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:01.698
Much better than dope.

1254
01:26:04.368 --> 01:26:06.203
You are all too much for me.

1255
01:26:07.204 --> 01:26:09.331
All I am is a working stiff.

1256
01:26:10.374 --> 01:26:12.584
I need to get to Clare.

1257
01:26:12.584 --> 01:26:15.712
I will do everything in
my power to put you both

1258
01:26:15.712 --> 01:26:18.298
together and never see
any of you again.

1259
01:26:18.298 --> 01:26:20.175
Then give her a message
from me. will you?

1260
01:26:20.175 --> 01:26:23.220
Tell her. I'll meet her in the
studio prop house. tonight

1261
01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:25.138
and I'll have the goods
on the ambassador.

1262
01:26:25.138 --> 01:26:26.390
What have you got on him?

1263
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:29.184
Just give her the
message. Marlowe.

1264
01:26:29.184 --> 01:26:31.019
There's a few things
I want cleared up

1265
01:26:31.019 --> 01:26:32.270
before we decide anything.

1266
01:26:32.270 --> 01:26:33.522
What do you wanna know?

1267
01:26:33.522 --> 01:26:35.524
The body outside
the Corbata Club.

1268
01:26:35.524 --> 01:26:38.068
A musician who worked the club.

1269
01:26:38.068 --> 01:26:41.863
- Did you kill him?
- No.

1270
01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:46.743
Opportune?

1271
01:26:46.743 --> 01:26:49.621
He looked like me.
I like people who look like me.

1272
01:26:49.621 --> 01:26:51.873
What does Dorothy Quincannon
want from you?

1273
01:26:51.873 --> 01:26:53.708
Well. maybe she wants to
fuck with the ambassador

1274
01:26:53.708 --> 01:26:56.962
who's maybe trying to fuck
her daughter. I don't know.

1275
01:26:56.962 --> 01:26:59.256
Put it together. Marlowe.
you're the detective.

1276
01:27:00.924 --> 01:27:04.970
Everyone wants something on
somebody else. it's all just...

1277
01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:06.721
blackmail in the end.

1278
01:27:09.141 --> 01:27:11.143
I'll be in the prop house...

1279
01:27:11.143 --> 01:27:13.520
7:30.

1280
01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:15.480
Tell her I've got
what she wants.

1281
01:27:21.695 --> 01:27:26.074
I've just realized. this
is my mother's favorite table.

1282
01:27:26.074 --> 01:27:28.994
This is where the ambassador
advises us financially.

1283
01:27:30.287 --> 01:27:31.496
You've asked her along?

1284
01:27:31.496 --> 01:27:33.623
Yes. I felt I needed
some advice.

1285
01:27:33.623 --> 01:27:37.169
Financial?
- More like professional.

1286
01:27:37.169 --> 01:27:38.420
Mm...

1287
01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:40.380
My. my. my. it's Clare.

1288
01:27:41.756 --> 01:27:44.843
What a wonderful surprise.
Mr. Marlowe.

1289
01:27:44.843 --> 01:27:46.094
Tea. mother?

1290
01:27:46.094 --> 01:27:47.762
Scalded.

1291
01:27:47.762 --> 01:27:49.890
Let's hope he brewed it right.

1292
01:27:49.890 --> 01:27:53.268
- So a mouse can trot on it.
- So a mouse can trot on it.

1293
01:27:53.268 --> 01:27:55.145
You know I've so
enjoyed our separate meetings

1294
01:27:55.145 --> 01:27:58.064
that I felt the need for us
all to sit together.

1295
01:27:58.064 --> 01:28:01.359
What Mr. Marlowe means.
my dear. is that he thinks

1296
01:28:01.359 --> 01:28:03.778
he's too clever
for the both of us.

1297
01:28:03.778 --> 01:28:06.573
One of you hired me.
the other tried to.

1298
01:28:06.573 --> 01:28:08.909
so you both seem
to want the same thing.

1299
01:28:08.909 --> 01:28:11.077
Nico left you
for a girl. alright.

1300
01:28:11.077 --> 01:28:14.164
A plaster mermaid
full of Mexican powder.

1301
01:28:14.164 --> 01:28:15.749
That's disgusting.

1302
01:28:15.749 --> 01:28:19.711
A subject about which you
claim to know nothing. yes?

1303
01:28:19.711 --> 01:28:22.380
Why don't you cut to the chase?

1304
01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:25.926
And ask her why she hired you.

1305
01:28:25.926 --> 01:28:27.969
To find Nico Peterson.

1306
01:28:27.969 --> 01:28:33.558
Hiring a detective might just
be the best way to suggest...

1307
01:28:33.558 --> 01:28:35.894
she doesn't know where he is.

1308
01:28:35.894 --> 01:28:37.479
What do you think. mother?

1309
01:28:37.479 --> 01:28:40.482
I'm keeping him in
a shack in Rosarito?

1310
01:28:40.482 --> 01:28:42.150
Maybe closer.

1311
01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:45.487
Why don't you tell Mr. Marlowe
what you want with him?

1312
01:28:46.613 --> 01:28:50.325
Perhaps I am trying my best...

1313
01:28:51.326 --> 01:28:53.370
to save your reputation.

1314
01:28:54.829 --> 01:28:58.917
Well. maybe. it's the
other way around. mother.

1315
01:28:58.917 --> 01:29:01.169
You see. Mr. Marlowe...

1316
01:29:01.169 --> 01:29:03.672
her lover dumped her.

1317
01:29:03.672 --> 01:29:08.260
The Ambassador to England
wants done with tinsel town.

1318
01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:12.639
So she's playing the only role
left for her to play.

1319
01:29:12.639 --> 01:29:14.558
The femme fatale.

1320
01:29:14.558 --> 01:29:17.102
Her very own Medea.

1321
01:29:19.187 --> 01:29:21.523
Oh. well!

1322
01:29:21.523 --> 01:29:24.401
It's a role that awaits
us all. my dear.

1323
01:29:32.158 --> 01:29:33.702
Huh!

1324
01:29:33.702 --> 01:29:35.036
Well...

1325
01:29:35.036 --> 01:29:38.707
You suspected one of us
would do this. but...

1326
01:29:38.707 --> 01:29:40.625
you just didn't know
which one. did you?

1327
01:29:40.625 --> 01:29:43.795
- Would've laid a dollar on you.
- Mm.

1328
01:29:43.795 --> 01:29:46.548
You've quite
mastered the technique

1329
01:29:46.548 --> 01:29:49.050
haven't you. Mr. Marlowe...

1330
01:29:49.050 --> 01:29:50.885
of upsetting the women
in your life?

1331
01:29:50.885 --> 01:29:52.971
There are no women in my life.

1332
01:29:54.431 --> 01:29:56.516
Well. then follow her.

1333
01:29:56.516 --> 01:29:58.727
She likes older men.

1334
01:30:01.396 --> 01:30:03.064
Don't worry...

1335
01:30:03.064 --> 01:30:05.692
I'll pay for the mess.
I always do.

1336
01:30:12.574 --> 01:30:14.993
Are you okay?

1337
01:30:14.993 --> 01:30:18.580
I don't care that I'm
less than you think I am.

1338
01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:20.790
I'm always less than
people think I am.

1339
01:30:22.083 --> 01:30:24.044
You're one of those
people who's just

1340
01:30:24.044 --> 01:30:26.588
lucky to be more
than we think you are.

1341
01:30:28.048 --> 01:30:30.759
I'll send you the balance
of what I owe you.

1342
01:30:30.759 --> 01:30:32.719
Maybe I can charge your mother?

1343
01:30:32.719 --> 01:30:35.430
- Together with a finder's fee.
- A what?

1344
01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:37.682
I found him. this afternoon.

1345
01:30:37.682 --> 01:30:39.267
Or rather. he found me.

1346
01:30:39.267 --> 01:30:41.811
I walked into my little house
and there he was.

1347
01:30:41.811 --> 01:30:45.357
- Mr. Nico Peterson.
- Where's he now?

1348
01:30:45.357 --> 01:30:49.027
He'll be waiting for you at the
prop house at Pacific Studios.

1349
01:30:49.027 --> 01:30:52.197
- 7:30 p.m.
- Why the prop house?

1350
01:30:52.197 --> 01:30:53.865
I was hoping you would tell me.

1351
01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:57.118
Taxi!

1352
01:30:59.996 --> 01:31:01.081
Go!

1353
01:31:10.507 --> 01:31:12.425
A car is more
than a vehicle

1354
01:31:12.425 --> 01:31:14.928
Mr. Hendricks used to tell me.

1355
01:31:14.928 --> 01:31:17.347
It's a sealed confessional.

1356
01:31:17.347 --> 01:31:19.724
A repository of secrets.

1357
01:31:19.724 --> 01:31:22.519
And this city.
devoted as it is

1358
01:31:22.519 --> 01:31:24.813
to the internal
combustion engine

1359
01:31:24.813 --> 01:31:27.524
is a city of motorized secrets.

1360
01:31:27.524 --> 01:31:30.568
You're waxing
philosophical. Cedric.

1361
01:31:30.568 --> 01:31:31.945
You have to forgive me.
Mr. Marlowe.

1362
01:31:31.945 --> 01:31:34.948
It's a habit I inherited
from my late employer.

1363
01:31:34.948 --> 01:31:39.494
He had a tendency to digress.
but you did say the prop house?

1364
01:31:39.494 --> 01:31:40.704
I did.

1365
01:31:41.955 --> 01:31:44.666
And I have to ask myself...

1366
01:31:44.666 --> 01:31:46.251
why the prop house?

1367
01:31:46.251 --> 01:31:49.671
And now you have to tell me.
Cedric. why the prop house?

1368
01:31:52.173 --> 01:31:55.552
Nico Peterson was
moving Lou Hendricks' product

1369
01:31:55.552 --> 01:31:57.804
through the prop
house for years.

1370
01:31:57.804 --> 01:32:01.099
And the product
is from Tijuana. hmm?

1371
01:32:01.099 --> 01:32:04.978
Hidden in a plaster
raven. the bust of Nefertiti.

1372
01:32:04.978 --> 01:32:07.689
A Virgin of Guadeloupe or a...

1373
01:32:07.689 --> 01:32:10.734
Serena Ornamental.

1374
01:32:10.734 --> 01:32:13.737
You see Mr. Hitchcock.
who could've worked wonders

1375
01:32:13.737 --> 01:32:17.866
for Pacific Pictures.
but is sadly on his way to MGM.

1376
01:32:17.866 --> 01:32:20.243
Mr. Hitchcock.
like Mr. Hendricks.

1377
01:32:20.243 --> 01:32:23.204
always liked to keep
the script to himself.

1378
01:32:24.789 --> 01:32:27.292
But many conversations.

1379
01:32:27.292 --> 01:32:30.795
overheard from this here
front seat. enabled me to do

1380
01:32:30.795 --> 01:32:34.215
what Mr. Hitchcock
always managed so adroitly...

1381
01:32:35.425 --> 01:32:37.051
to work out the plot.

1382
01:32:39.679 --> 01:32:42.724
It was never really
about a mermaid.

1383
01:32:42.724 --> 01:32:43.892
It was always
about the contents

1384
01:32:43.892 --> 01:32:45.894
of a certain briefcase.

1385
01:32:45.894 --> 01:32:48.980
which could bring
a whole studio down.

1386
01:32:57.113 --> 01:32:58.406
Clare.

1387
01:32:58.406 --> 01:32:59.574
Nico.

1388
01:33:00.575 --> 01:33:02.035
You're on your own?

1389
01:33:02.035 --> 01:33:05.288
Did you want the full
auction house. Nico?

1390
01:33:05.288 --> 01:33:06.998
Me. my mother...

1391
01:33:06.998 --> 01:33:09.834
Floyd Hanson. Lou Hendricks?

1392
01:33:09.834 --> 01:33:12.378
That would be difficult.
two of them are dead.

1393
01:33:12.378 --> 01:33:15.590
Well. you're gonna have
to start the bidding with me.

1394
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:19.219
What I've got here
is worth a fortune.

1395
01:33:19.219 --> 01:33:21.262
Really?

1396
01:33:21.262 --> 01:33:22.847
You better show me then.

1397
01:33:25.725 --> 01:33:28.102
All of the records...

1398
01:33:28.102 --> 01:33:31.105
of the heroin which was
flowing through his studio.

1399
01:33:34.317 --> 01:33:36.945
It's more than enough to ruin
the ambassador's reputation.

1400
01:33:36.945 --> 01:33:39.864
and the reputation
of Pacific Pictures.

1401
01:33:39.864 --> 01:33:41.533
Nico Peterson
went missing

1402
01:33:41.533 --> 01:33:45.620
with one Serena Ornamental
and one handmade briefcase

1403
01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:48.289
packed with records
of every dope transaction

1404
01:33:48.289 --> 01:33:52.001
since he and Lou Hendricks
started business.

1405
01:33:52.001 --> 01:33:54.337
He was trying to
sell this information

1406
01:33:54.337 --> 01:33:56.172
to anyone he could find.

1407
01:33:59.926 --> 01:34:02.971
I'm a book-keeper.
darling. a good one.

1408
01:34:02.971 --> 01:34:06.432
Import. export.
I kept every transaction.

1409
01:34:12.981 --> 01:34:16.109
You're more than
a book-keeper. Nico.

1410
01:34:16.109 --> 01:34:18.319
You'd sell tickets
to the gates of hell.

1411
01:34:19.654 --> 01:34:22.490
Maybe that's why
you like me.

1412
01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:25.827
I never liked you. Nico.

1413
01:34:28.830 --> 01:34:30.498
Do you trust me
that little. Clare?

1414
01:34:31.916 --> 01:34:34.627
You know how
it is these days. Nico.

1415
01:34:34.627 --> 01:34:36.170
Nobody trusts anyone.

1416
01:34:37.630 --> 01:34:39.507
What-- what was
that sound. Clare?

1417
01:34:39.507 --> 01:34:41.092
My mother's gun.

1418
01:34:41.092 --> 01:34:42.844
I found it in her boudoir.

1419
01:34:44.095 --> 01:34:45.763
Ah. fuck!

1420
01:34:45.763 --> 01:34:48.016
I'm so bad with these.

1421
01:34:48.016 --> 01:34:49.309
Why are you doing this?

1422
01:34:49.309 --> 01:34:51.477
You've always played
too low. Nico.

1423
01:34:51.477 --> 01:34:54.522
Take a lesson from me
and go straight to the top.

1424
01:34:55.732 --> 01:34:57.275
That's better.

1425
01:34:58.610 --> 01:34:59.777
Ah!

1426
01:35:17.712 --> 01:35:20.924
I'm burning your books. Nico.

1427
01:35:32.977 --> 01:35:35.146
Is he dead. Mr. Marlowe?

1428
01:35:36.230 --> 01:35:37.231
At last.

1429
01:35:38.566 --> 01:35:40.652
And that's why you hired me?

1430
01:35:40.652 --> 01:35:42.320
So you could finally kill him?

1431
01:35:43.821 --> 01:35:45.907
It's one of the reasons.

1432
01:35:45.907 --> 01:35:48.201
Has the ambassador paid you off?

1433
01:35:48.201 --> 01:35:50.036
I imagine he'll have
to after this

1434
01:35:50.036 --> 01:35:51.829
little piece of spring cleaning.

1435
01:35:55.959 --> 01:35:58.878
Tell me why
I shouldn't shop you.

1436
01:36:02.173 --> 01:36:05.134
Because he was
far too young for me?

1437
01:36:05.134 --> 01:36:07.053
Because he was evil incarnate?

1438
01:36:08.596 --> 01:36:10.056
Because he was already dead.

1439
01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:13.935
Let me deep six this.

1440
01:36:18.064 --> 01:36:19.857
Use the side door.

1441
01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:30.368
Goodbye. Clare Cavendish.

1442
01:36:33.121 --> 01:36:35.832
Good evening. Mr. Marlowe.

1443
01:37:20.168 --> 01:37:22.920
Tell me you didn't
set that fire. Marlowe.

1444
01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:25.506
No. Bernie. you know
I only put 'em out.

1445
01:37:27.258 --> 01:37:29.886
What do you think
I'll find inside?

1446
01:37:29.886 --> 01:37:31.929
The bust of Nefertiti.

1447
01:37:31.929 --> 01:37:34.640
The Ark of the Covenant.

1448
01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:35.975
Maltese Falcon.

1449
01:37:35.975 --> 01:37:37.268
Oh...

1450
01:37:37.268 --> 01:37:38.936
Nothing more significant?

1451
01:37:40.021 --> 01:37:41.481
What more could you want?

1452
01:37:47.612 --> 01:37:49.864
So you got caught
in the crossfire

1453
01:37:49.864 --> 01:37:51.491
between a mother
and a daughter?

1454
01:37:51.491 --> 01:37:53.576
Yep.
I never seem to learn.

1455
01:37:53.576 --> 01:37:55.745
And who wins.
Mr. Marlowe?

1456
01:37:55.745 --> 01:37:57.371
The mother or the daughter?

1457
01:37:57.371 --> 01:37:59.373
Who would you
put your money on?

1458
01:37:59.373 --> 01:38:01.167
Well. the ambassador loses.

1459
01:38:01.167 --> 01:38:05.046
Those guys never lose.
Cedric. they just move on.

1460
01:38:09.759 --> 01:38:11.469
Mr. Marlowe?

1461
01:38:11.469 --> 01:38:12.720
Yeah.

1462
01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:14.931
She will see you now.

1463
01:38:14.931 --> 01:38:16.224
Thank you.

1464
01:38:21.187 --> 01:38:23.606
- Mr. Marlowe.
- Mrs. Cavendish.

1465
01:38:26.734 --> 01:38:30.071
So. this was the transaction?

1466
01:38:33.074 --> 01:38:36.410
What exactly do you mean?
Man 5: Thank you.

1467
01:38:36.410 --> 01:38:39.872
You saved the ambassador's ass.
he lets you run things.

1468
01:38:39.872 --> 01:38:43.376
It's better than the bootlegging
trade. don't you think?

1469
01:38:43.376 --> 01:38:46.420
The ambassadors
moved beyond all that.

1470
01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:48.756
Your mother's acting
again I see.

1471
01:38:48.756 --> 01:38:50.591
Uh. she never stopped.

1472
01:38:52.093 --> 01:38:53.678
What's the story?

1473
01:38:53.678 --> 01:38:56.264
Oh. you know. like any.

1474
01:38:56.264 --> 01:38:59.267
Love. murder. reconciliation.

1475
01:38:59.267 --> 01:39:01.018
Happy ending?

1476
01:39:01.018 --> 01:39:02.562
Mm...

1477
01:39:02.562 --> 01:39:05.314
We're working on that.

1478
01:39:05.314 --> 01:39:10.069
So. are you. uh. going to tell
me why I'm here. Mrs. Cavendish?

1479
01:39:10.069 --> 01:39:13.698
The studio needs someone to
play knight in shining armor.

1480
01:39:15.116 --> 01:39:17.702
I saw ten of those guys outside.

1481
01:39:17.702 --> 01:39:19.453
They can only act the part.

1482
01:39:19.453 --> 01:39:21.372
So I should say
my goodbyes then.

1483
01:39:22.456 --> 01:39:25.126
The studios all
cleaned up. Mr. Marlowe.

1484
01:39:27.503 --> 01:39:30.339
Roosevelt's an inch
from joining the war effort.

1485
01:39:32.383 --> 01:39:35.761
The ambassador would like to...

1486
01:39:35.761 --> 01:39:38.806
reward you for your discretion.

1487
01:39:38.806 --> 01:39:42.059
The studio will always need
its private detective.

1488
01:39:42.059 --> 01:39:43.978
You're offering me a job?

1489
01:39:48.441 --> 01:39:50.651
More than a job.

1490
01:39:50.651 --> 01:39:52.069
A pension.

1491
01:39:53.154 --> 01:39:55.656
Executive in charge of security.

1492
01:39:58.451 --> 01:40:00.995
We all have our secrets.
Mr. Marlowe.

1493
01:40:02.830 --> 01:40:05.499
Leading men with their
little peccadilloes.

1494
01:40:05.499 --> 01:40:07.376
Leading ladies
who can't function

1495
01:40:07.376 --> 01:40:09.378
without their Mexican tinctures.

1496
01:40:10.671 --> 01:40:13.257
We all need someone
to keep us in line.

1497
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:17.637
And your secrets.
Mrs. Cavendish?

1498
01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:21.390
You'll have to keep those too.

1499
01:40:22.767 --> 01:40:25.019
Not for me. Mrs. Cavendish.

1500
01:40:28.022 --> 01:40:30.733
However. I can
recommend someone.

1501
01:40:33.194 --> 01:40:35.279
I'll need references of course.

1502
01:40:35.279 --> 01:40:38.407
He's a friend of mine.
he's very capable.

1503
01:40:38.407 --> 01:40:41.702
He's dealt with many
situations in the past.

1504
01:40:41.702 --> 01:40:43.871
Very well spoken.

1505
01:40:43.871 --> 01:40:46.123
And a great keeper of secrets.

1506
01:40:47.541 --> 01:40:51.045
Are you blackmailing me.
Mr. Marlowe?

1507
01:40:51.045 --> 01:40:53.673
Blackmail?

1508
01:40:53.673 --> 01:40:55.299
I would never.

1509
01:40:56.759 --> 01:40:58.552
I leave that to others.

1510
01:41:00.096 --> 01:41:01.264
Good day.

1511
01:41:14.986 --> 01:41:19.365
They don't like books. do they.
Mr. Marlowe. those Nazis.

1512
01:41:19.365 --> 01:41:21.909
They don't like
many things. Cedric.

1513
01:41:21.909 --> 01:41:26.497
Still. that Leni Riefenstahl
makes some good movies though.

1514
01:41:26.497 --> 01:41:28.749
You really like them.
don't you. motion pictures?

1515
01:41:29.834 --> 01:41:31.877
I certainly do. Mr. Marlowe.

1516
01:41:31.877 --> 01:41:36.048
Mrs. Cavendish of Pacific
might have a position for you.

1517
01:41:36.048 --> 01:41:39.385
As chief of security.
that's if you're interested.

1518
01:41:39.385 --> 01:41:42.138
Oh. I'd be very interested.
Mr. Marlowe.

1519
01:41:42.138 --> 01:41:43.848
I would happily recommend you.

1520
01:41:45.016 --> 01:41:47.184
I'd need references. huh?

1521
01:41:47.184 --> 01:41:49.687
Only one. me.

1522
01:41:50.563 --> 01:41:52.481

I can't shoot anyone with it?
