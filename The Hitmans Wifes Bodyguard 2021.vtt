across Europe

76
00:03:38.747 --> 00:03:41.385
so he could give evidence
at a war crimes trial -

77
00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.179

I might add -

78
00:03:44.214 --> 00:03:45.983

they wouldn't...

..they wouldn't recognise it.

80
00:03:47.426 --> 00:03:49.855
Apparently they don't take
kindly to protecting sociopaths.

81

I don't have validation issues.

91
00:04:12.077 --> 00:04:13.714
I have a licensing issue.

92
00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:15.914
I am a bodyguard
without a licence.

93
00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:20.424
That's like being a...
a belly dancer without a torso.

94
00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:23.592
What are you thinking about
right now. Michael?

95
00:04:24.595 --> 00:04:26.254
I'm thinking about
the fact that you're seated

96
00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:27.761
six feet away from
an exposed window with

97
00:04:27.796 --> 00:04:30.159
multiple sniper nest positions
on the building opposite.

98
00:04:30.194 --> 00:04:31.963
most likely on the eighth floor.

99
00:04:31.998 --> 00:04:34.405
The additional height
gives the marksman an advantage.

100
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.604
I'm thinking about

101
00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.474
the closest available weapon
to me right now -

102
00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:39.509
the letter opener/
stabbing instrument

103
00:04:39.544 --> 00:04:41.907
on the desk to my right.

104
00:04:41.942 --> 00:04:43.348
What are you thinking about?

105
00:04:44.142 --> 00:04:47.275
I'm thinking you need to forget
bodyguarding for a while

106
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.046
and find happiness within.

107
00:04:49.081 --> 00:04:50.179
Within what?

108
00:04:50.214 --> 00:04:51.488
Within yourself!

109
00:04:51.523 --> 00:04:54.392
Happiness in who you are.

110
00:04:56.022 --> 00:04:57.087

111
00:04:57.122 --> 00:04:58.462
Well. first things first -

112
00:04:58.497 --> 00:05:01.091
I think all the guns
and violence are...

113
00:05:01.126 --> 00:05:02.631
..weighing on your soul.

114
00:05:02.666 --> 00:05:05.469
So you need to get away
and clear your mind

115
00:05:05.504 --> 00:05:08.934
and then you can find
your future self.

116
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.871

127
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.533

find it helpful

the truth.

Sonia told Kincaid

1927
01:31:40.291 --> 01:31:42.991
that Aristotle is drilling into
the data junction at Viarregio.

in an hour.

-Let us take him down.
-Come on.

1931
01:31:50.264 --> 01:31:51.637
We just got reports of drilling

1932
01:31:51.672 --> 01:31:53.573
at a location
in the centre of Viarregio.

1933
01:31:53.608 --> 01:31:55.740
What assets do we have
on the ground in that region?

1934
01:31:55.775 --> 01:31:57.500
The closest agent
is Bobby O'Neill.

1935

1936

the Boston way.

Fine. Alert all local forces
and send them to that drill.

1938

for international waters.

1940
01:32:07.952 --> 01:32:10.051
So. don't be the government
agent in the documentary

1941

guy. then lets him go anyway.

to stop Aristotle?
