-You know what I mean.

183
00:12:05.855 --> 00:12:09.250
-Honestly. I don't.

184
00:12:09.293 --> 00:12:10.686
-About him.

185
00:12:15.386 --> 00:12:17.432
-I've seen your search history.

186
00:12:17.475 --> 00:12:20.565
You've seen every article
ever written about him.

187
00:12:20.609 --> 00:12:22.959
What more do you want to know?

188
00:12:23.003 --> 00:12:24.831
-What happened to you.

-No.
-KARMA: No?

That's it?

Mom.

192
00:12:30.793 --> 00:12:32.012
It feels like
I'm going in blind here

193
00:12:32.055 --> 00:12:33.143
and it might help to actually.

like. know--
-It won't.

195
00:12:36.886 --> 00:12:38.583
What you don't know

196
00:12:38.627 --> 00:12:41.586
is the only thing keeping you
calm and sane right now.

197
00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:43.066
I promise.

-Hmm. Yeah.

-Oh. yeah. Hugs.

-Karma. this is Butch.

I'd really hate to see
how you say hello

to someone you don't like.

210
00:14:18.292 --> 00:14:20.163
-Ah. yeah.
Sorry about that.

211
00:14:20.207 --> 00:14:21.425
Didn't--didn't mean to
give you a start.

212
00:14:21.469 --> 00:14:23.079

you can't be too careful. right?

-Especially now.

215
00:14:27.692 --> 00:14:29.477
So. uh. why don't we go inside

216
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.479
and let Priscilla
feed you some breakfast?

217
00:14:31.522 --> 00:14:32.741
That'll make her happy.

218

I'm sure it was just the wind.

I'll get some strawberries
from the garden.

that you got into

There are motion sensors
all around the edges.

so we're gonna know if anybody
gets too close for comfort.

is if I let them in.

in our room.

what you said to her?

About how safe it is here?

307
00:19:17.547 --> 00:19:19.201
-Yeah.

were last tracking him

in Oaxaca. Mexico.

-But somebody dropped
that note at our place.

anybody to do that.

shows up in the reports.

I don't need to tell you--

324
00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:00.199
I mean. Paul is basically
the Pied Piper of lost souls.

325
00:20:00.242 --> 00:20:02.636
He can get anyone
to follow him through fire

326
00:20:02.679 --> 00:20:05.116
and not ask for water
on the other side.

327

-[chuckles]

328
00:20:10.557 --> 00:20:11.993
But that far in in Mexico.

329
00:20:12.036 --> 00:20:14.213
I thought he was
sticking closer to TJ.

330
00:20:16.432 --> 00:20:19.087
-Well. a few too many girls
disappeared.

331
00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:20.784
He had to move on.

332
00:20:20.828 --> 00:20:22.482
-Yeah.

333
00:20:22.525 --> 00:20:25.920
In some ways. I'm sure Mexico
is perfect for him.

334
00:20:25.963 --> 00:20:27.791
Remember when all those
factory women turned up missing

335
00:20:27.835 --> 00:20:28.705
a few years back?

336
00:20:30.141 --> 00:20:31.447
-Yeah.

337
00:20:31.491 --> 00:20:34.755
Well. as long as
you're poor and brown.

338
00:20:34.798 --> 00:20:37.627

-I'm sorry if I scared you
last night.

343
00:21:05.568 --> 00:21:08.615
That's part of why I don't like
talking about your father.

344
00:21:08.658 --> 00:21:10.660
I don't want to give you fear
that isn't yours.

345
00:21:10.704 --> 00:21:14.838
-It's okay. I just wish you
wouldn't treat me like a child.

346

-Honey. you are a child.

347
00:21:17.711 --> 00:21:19.452
It's my job to treat you
like one.

as you were when you had me.

I was a child then. too.

-Who?
-Butch.

00:21:32.073 --> 00:21:34.118
-Absolutely. With my life.

-Mom. I think there was
something in that shake.

354
00:21:39.298 --> 00:21:41.082
I don't feel right.

355
00:21:41.125 --> 00:21:43.345
-No. I'm sure it's just nerves.

356
00:21:43.389 --> 00:21:45.216
Look. Butch went to
an awful lot of trouble

357
00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:46.957
to make sure he didn't

538
00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:22.049
-Here you go.

539
00:36:23.616 --> 00:36:25.966
Oh! [laughs]

540
00:36:26.009 --> 00:36:28.751
What do you say?

541
00:36:28.795 --> 00:36:30.275
-Please.

542
00:36:30.318 --> 00:36:31.711
-Please what?

543
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:35.889
-Sir.

544
00:36:35.932 --> 00:36:37.891
-Good job.

545

[chuckles]

550
00:36:49.946 --> 00:36:54.342
You know. you're all
the same. aren't you?

551
00:36:54.386 --> 00:36:56.475
Just all full of
your own desires.

552
00:36:56.518 --> 00:36:58.172
Slaves to your physical needs.

553
00:36:59.913 --> 00:37:01.219
That's the most
important thing. right?

554
00:37:05.832 --> 00:37:06.963
I should've had a son.

555
00:37:31.423 --> 00:37:32.424
-Wendell!

556

557
00:37:41.128 --> 00:37:44.044
-Where do you think
you're going?

558
00:37:44.087 --> 00:37:46.307
You can let go of her now.

559
00:37:46.351 --> 00:37:51.181
You know. next time you do that.
you're gonna get shot.

560
00:37:51.225 --> 00:37:52.661
All right?

561
00:37:52.705 --> 00:37:54.097
You can go. Wendell.

562
00:37:58.319 --> 00:38:00.016
What are you so serious about?

563
00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:02.062
You know I'm just
joking around. right?

564
00:38:03.846 --> 00:38:05.326
[laughs]

565
00:38:08.895 --> 00:38:11.463
That shaking thing.
It means I'm getting to you.

566
00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:15.249
It's a really bad habit.

567
00:38:17.207 --> 00:38:22.735
You ever hear of a. uh...
Harry Harlow?

568
00:38:22.778 --> 00:38:24.476
Ring a bell?

569
00:38:24.519 --> 00:38:25.694
No?

570
00:38:29.394 --> 00:38:32.310
And they let you
into Harvard. huh?

571
00:38:32.353 --> 00:38:34.312
[laughs]

572
00:38:34.355 --> 00:38:35.661
You know what he did?

573
00:38:36.836 --> 00:38:39.317
He got a bunch of monkeys.

574
00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:42.015
and he took their mother
away from them.

575
00:38:42.058 --> 00:38:45.235
And then he gave them
a choice of mom:

576
00:38:47.499 --> 00:38:52.895
one made out of wire.
to feed them.

577
00:38:52.939 --> 00:38:58.945
Or a nice. you know.
soft. nice. cozy.

578
00:38:58.988 --> 00:39:02.688
comfortable. gentle mother
to watch them starve.

579
00:39:05.212 --> 00:39:08.215
Which one do you think
they picked. huh?

580
00:39:08.258 --> 00:39:09.608
'Cause I'm trying to find out:

581
00:39:09.651 --> 00:39:11.392
Are you a real girl?

582
00:39:11.436 --> 00:39:13.002
Or a fucking monkey?

583
00:39:14.134 --> 00:39:17.398
Which one are you?

584
00:39:17.442 --> 00:39:19.574
You a fucking monkey?

585
00:39:19.618 --> 00:39:22.838
[imitates monkey noise]

586
00:39:22.882 --> 00:39:25.275
[laughs]

587
00:39:25.319 --> 00:39:27.843
You don't like that. do you?

588
00:39:27.887 --> 00:39:30.498
Which one do you think
they picked. huh?

589
00:39:30.542 --> 00:39:39.246
-Um. [clears throat]
The cold...cold wire mom?

590
00:39:39.289 --> 00:39:40.552
-The wire.

591
00:39:40.595 --> 00:39:42.292
[sucks through his teeth]
Ooh.

592
00:39:42.336 --> 00:39:45.600
No. Of course they picked
the nice. soft. cozy. warm.

593
00:39:45.644 --> 00:39:50.431
comfortable mother
to watch them starve.

594
00:39:50.475 --> 00:39:54.174
Listen...you can leave
if you want.

595
00:39:54.217 --> 00:39:56.742
You can go run away.
It's open.

596
00:39:56.785 --> 00:39:58.091
Go ahead. take it.

597
00:40:03.705 --> 00:40:04.880
Go ahead.

598

Ooh.

599

Except for one thing.

600
00:40:11.452 --> 00:40:12.888
Uh. your mom is staying here.

601
00:40:15.369 --> 00:40:18.328
-No. No. I won't leave her.

602
00:40:18.372 --> 00:40:19.417
-Oh yeah. you will.

603
00:40:20.592 --> 00:40:22.202
Yeah. yeah. you are. Yeah.

604
00:40:22.245 --> 00:40:25.858
-No. No. No.
I'm not leaving without my mom.

605
00:40:25.901 --> 00:40:27.294
-You got about five minutes
to make up your mind

606
00:40:27.337 --> 00:40:28.469
because Wendell's
gonna come back out

607
00:40:28.513 --> 00:40:29.775
to check on me. so here.

608
00:40:44.529 --> 00:40:47.357

-Roadside assistance. [laughs]

615
00:41:10.555 --> 00:41:13.079
A little trouble
with your starter there?

616
00:41:13.122 --> 00:41:15.647
That's because I told Wendell
to disengage it.

617
00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:17.344
'cause you ain't going nowhere.

618

-Mom? It's me.
Can you talk?

00:41:47.374 --> 00:41:49.724
Priscilla! Are you okay?

624
00:41:49.768 --> 00:41:52.422
Do you know where my mom is?

625

Where's my mom?

[muffled screaming]

a word of advice?

-Shhh.

629
00:42:15.881 --> 00:42:18.448
-[whispering] I've spent
a lot of time with your father.

630
00:42:18.492 --> 00:42:21.800
And at this point. struggling
can only make things worse.

631
00:42:21.843 --> 00:42:23.845
He wants to break your spirit.

632
00:42:23.889 --> 00:42:25.586
It's not personal.

633
00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:29.982
It's not about violence.
This is just what he does.

634
00:42:30.025 --> 00:42:31.723
He wants to crawl
inside your head

635
00:42:31.766 --> 00:42:34.856
and make you
just as cruel as he is.

636
00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:36.423
-You said no one
was getting in here

637
00:42:36.466 --> 00:42:39.165
unless you let them in.

638
00:42:39.208 --> 00:42:41.297
-I can promise you.
it wasn't me.

639
00:42:43.648 --> 00:42:45.650
I'd rather die than
help that man again.

640
00:42:48.609 --> 00:42:49.828
-Then who was it?

-Well. good afternoon
to you. too.

647
00:43:33.436 --> 00:43:36.222
She's right where
she should be. all right?

648
00:43:36.265 --> 00:43:37.440
Ask stupid questions.

649
00:43:39.268 --> 00:43:40.269
-I'm vegan.

650
00:43:41.706 --> 00:43:45.057
-I don't really care
one way or the other.

651
00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:46.275
-I'm not going to eat it.

652
00:43:46.319 --> 00:43:48.016
-Yes. you are.

653
00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:50.149
-Or what?

654
00:43:50.192 --> 00:43:52.107
-Or what?

655
00:43:52.151 --> 00:43:54.240
Well. I tell you. um.

656
00:43:56.198 --> 00:43:58.940
you're never gonna
see your mother again.

657
00:43:58.984 --> 00:44:00.115
How about that?

658
00:44:03.162 --> 00:44:06.426
-So if I eat this.
I can see my mom?

659
00:44:06.469 --> 00:44:08.950
-What's so wonderful
about mothers?

660
00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:12.214
If you tell me what's
so goddamned important

661
00:44:12.258 --> 00:44:14.347
about a mother.
that might help.

662
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:16.392
-You must have had one.

663
00:44:16.436 --> 00:44:19.918
-Your grandma
was a real peach of a woman.

664
00:44:19.961 --> 00:44:22.660
The--the fucking face
that launched a thousand drunks.

665
00:44:22.703 --> 00:44:24.487
-Paul. Spare the girl.

666
00:44:26.011 --> 00:44:27.708
PAUL: Why?

667
00:44:27.752 --> 00:44:30.058
What's so goddamned important
about being a mother?

668
00:44:30.102 --> 00:44:35.281
I was thinking maybe we should
ask. uh. Priscilla.

669
00:44:35.324 --> 00:44:36.891
She's a mom. She would know.

670
00:44:36.935 --> 00:44:38.676
Maybe she has some insight.

671
00:44:38.719 --> 00:44:40.199
-You know she doesn't speak.

672
00:44:40.242 --> 00:44:42.680
Please.

673
00:44:42.723 --> 00:44:44.725
-Yeah. well.

674
00:44:44.769 --> 00:44:46.640
Not many marriages can survive.

675
00:44:46.684 --> 00:44:51.601
you know. a daughter's throat
being slit by the father.

676
00:44:51.645 --> 00:44:52.951
Right. Butch?

-[Priscilla cries]

678
00:44:56.868 --> 00:44:58.347
-I mean.
you don't even know

679
00:44:58.391 --> 00:44:59.827
what happened
between these two. do you?

680
00:44:59.871 --> 00:45:01.263
-They told me
you killed their daughter.

00:45:01.307 --> 00:45:03.352
-[laughs]
Oh. that's a good one.

682
00:45:05.833 --> 00:45:07.922
-I never said
he was the one who did it.

683

-All right...so.

The mute's crying now! Yes.

all right?

Every second of it.

687
00:45:22.981 --> 00:45:25.157
But these two
haven't done anything.

688
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.115
Let them go.

689
00:45:27.159 --> 00:45:29.683
Let them go! Do whatever
you want with me.

690
00:45:29.727 --> 00:45:31.424
-You--you really mean that?

691
00:45:31.467 --> 00:45:32.599
-Yes.

anything you don't want to.

You don't have to.

-[laughs]

711
00:46:20.212 --> 00:46:24.216
You know. I was your age
when I killed my mother.

712
00:46:25.695 --> 00:46:28.046
She was the first one.

713
00:46:28.089 --> 00:46:30.788
Yeah. But at least
I didn't eat her.

if you ate.

719
00:46:53.811 --> 00:46:55.290
you'd see her again.

720
00:46:56.857 --> 00:46:59.338
Wendell. Get rid of these two.

727
00:48:04.272 --> 00:48:05.534
Come on. Stand up.

728
00:48:07.232 --> 00:48:08.450
Here.

-[laughing]

730
00:48:19.418 --> 00:48:27.556
[clears throat] You know. um...
I'm very proud of you.

731
00:48:28.906 --> 00:48:30.908
What you did at lunchtime.

732
00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:36.130
You earned the right of choice.

733
00:48:36.174 --> 00:48:37.262
These two?

734
00:48:39.699 --> 00:48:43.529
I'll fucking kill them both
right now.

735
00:48:43.572 --> 00:48:45.096
I'll stab them to death.

736
00:48:47.707 --> 00:48:49.927
But you earned the right
to decide.

737
00:48:53.017 --> 00:48:57.499
You kill one of them
or I'll do them both.

738
00:49:01.199 --> 00:49:02.896
-Karma.

739
00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:04.898
Karma. I'm begging you.

740
00:49:04.942 --> 00:49:06.900
Kill me. leave Priscilla.

741
00:49:06.944 --> 00:49:08.380
Let Priscilla live.

742

-Come on.

745
00:49:20.827 --> 00:49:22.133
Good girl.

746
00:49:24.004 --> 00:49:26.311
You could actually save a life.

747
00:49:29.096 --> 00:49:30.968
BUTCH: Kill me!

748
00:49:31.011 --> 00:49:32.360

The time is now.

Butch or Priscilla. which one?
Who you gonna do?

752
00:49:45.417 --> 00:49:47.201

-[Paul laughs]

754

You're gonna stab yourself.
is that it?

755
00:49:58.082 --> 00:50:00.084
Yeah. you know how hard
that is to do?

756
00:50:02.912 --> 00:50:05.393

through your T-shirt. all right?

a really good show.

What do you think?

760
00:50:32.116 --> 00:50:33.595
Huh? All right.

761
00:50:33.639 --> 00:50:37.860
-No!! No.

PAUL: You know.

766
00:51:11.894 --> 00:51:16.943
when I was a kid. I really
didn't get fed enough.

767
00:51:18.858 --> 00:51:22.949
My mother didn't really
feed me good.

768
00:51:22.992 --> 00:51:25.517
So. one day I took a stick.

769
00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:30.739
I was so fucking hungry that

770
00:51:30.783 --> 00:51:32.872
I killed a rat.

771
00:51:32.915 --> 00:51:36.267
With a stick. And I ate it.

772
00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:38.660
That's how. you know.
hungry I was.

773
00:51:38.704 --> 00:51:41.141
See. and there's a rat.
right there.

774
00:51:43.448 --> 00:51:46.799
You know what it's like to
have a rat in your life?

775
00:51:46.842 --> 00:51:49.845
You know. who wants that? Right?

776
00:51:49.889 --> 00:51:51.804
That's not good for Papa.
Is it?

777
00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:55.721
A rat. on a stick.

778
00:51:55.764 --> 00:51:57.636
Open up your mouth. rat.

779
00:51:57.679 --> 00:51:59.290
Open up!

780
00:52:00.943 --> 00:52:02.336
-Fuck you.

-[groans] Mom?

00:52:06.732 --> 00:52:08.603
Mom?
-PAUL: Open up your mouth!

-I thought you were dead.

784

Are you okay?

785
00:52:12.868 --> 00:52:15.436
Where were you? Mom!

Mom!

789
00:52:27.492 --> 00:52:30.190
What's going on? What?
Is he making you do this?

790
00:52:30.234 --> 00:52:32.453
-Nothing.
No. no. of course not.

791
00:52:32.497 --> 00:52:33.715
-So you just decided
to come out

792
00:52:33.759 --> 00:52:35.587
and save his life
instead of mine?

793
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:38.851
-I believe in
the power of choice. honey.

794
00:52:38.894 --> 00:52:41.506
-That's something he thinks;
that's not something you think.

795
00:52:41.549 --> 00:52:43.421
-We think the same things.

796
00:52:43.464 --> 00:52:45.423
-Since when?!

797
00:52:45.466 --> 00:52:47.207
-Let's talk
about this later. okay?

798
00:52:47.251 --> 00:52:51.037
You're tired and you don't know
what you're saying.

799
00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:53.692
-I thought we were
best friends. Mom.

800
00:52:53.735 --> 00:52:56.042
-Of course we are.

801
00:52:56.085 --> 00:52:59.828
But this is the highest honor
I could hope for for you. Karma.

802
00:52:59.872 --> 00:53:01.221
-What are you talking about?

803
00:53:01.265 --> 00:53:04.181
How--how is this an honor?

804
00:53:04.224 --> 00:53:06.183
Did he drug you? Mom?

805
00:53:09.882 --> 00:53:13.102
-Hey. listen.
You know what?

806
00:53:13.146 --> 00:53:17.281
This woman right here
has never wavered against me.

807
00:53:17.324 --> 00:53:22.590
never went away from me.
for 17 years.

808
00:53:22.634 --> 00:53:24.897
You know. she gave birth to you.
you know.

809
00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:26.115
to save her own skin.

810
00:53:26.159 --> 00:53:29.075
but nevertheless.
she did do that.

811
00:53:33.688 --> 00:53:36.256
-The path is clear. Karma.

812
00:53:38.302 --> 00:53:39.955
The soul may reject the vessel.

813
00:53:39.999 --> 00:53:42.523
but not if she's
a perfect genetic match.

814
00:53:45.874 --> 00:53:47.136
A daughter.

815
00:53:51.402 --> 00:53:53.665
-You bred me for him?

No! No! No!

821
00:54:13.772 --> 00:54:16.383
Mom. please.

822
00:54:16.427 --> 00:54:19.430
Mom. Mom!

823
00:54:20.866 --> 00:54:24.348
-Honey.
we have great news for you.

824
00:54:24.391 --> 00:54:26.741
Should I tell her.
or do you want to?

825
00:54:26.785 --> 00:54:29.744
-Uh. you go ahead.

826
00:54:29.788 --> 00:54:33.313
-You passed. Yay!

827
00:54:33.357 --> 00:54:35.228
It was touch and go there
for a while

828
00:54:35.272 --> 00:54:37.709
with your attachment to me.
but you came through at the end

829
00:54:37.752 --> 00:54:41.147
and you really
stuck the landing.

830
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:43.410
-Yeah. you sure did.

831
00:54:43.454 --> 00:54:44.803
I'm proud of you. Karma.

832
00:54:44.846 --> 00:54:46.892
-Fuck you.
you fucking psychopath.

833
00:54:46.935 --> 00:54:49.677
-You see?
I told you she had spirit.

834
00:54:49.721 --> 00:54:52.985
-Well. I mean.
you were right.

835
00:54:53.028 --> 00:54:56.380
but she also had
a lot of bad habits.

836
00:54:56.423 --> 00:55:00.775
and sometimes you have to
break somebody's spirit

837
00:55:00.819 --> 00:55:04.475
to get rid of bad habits.
and that's what we did. so...

838
00:55:08.696 --> 00:55:10.219
-So can I leave now?

839
00:55:10.263 --> 00:55:12.047
-Even better.

840
00:55:12.091 --> 00:55:13.527
You might not like
the sound of this at first.

841
00:55:13.571 --> 00:55:15.921
but I promise you.
it's going to be amazing.

842
00:55:17.879 --> 00:55:21.883
-Karma. you and I
are going to spend

843
00:55:21.927 --> 00:55:26.279
the rest of our lives together.
starting tonight.

844
00:55:29.108 --> 00:55:30.457
-What?

845
00:55:30.501 --> 00:55:32.720
-I mean.
there's really no higher honor.

846
00:55:32.764 --> 00:55:34.374
I would have offered
to do it myself.

847
00:55:34.418 --> 00:55:37.246
but I wouldn't be
a genetic match.

848
00:55:39.727 --> 00:55:41.250
-But I thought
if I survived then...

849
00:55:41.294 --> 00:55:43.078
-Oh. no. no.
This was never about survival.

850
00:55:43.122 --> 00:55:46.168
It was about getting you ready.

851
00:55:46.212 --> 00:55:48.693
-Ready for what?

852
00:55:48.736 --> 00:55:52.827
-You have to break
the spirit of the host

853
00:55:52.871 --> 00:55:59.094
before the new soul
enters the body.

854
00:55:59.138 --> 00:56:02.097
-And in your case. honey.
we had to prepare you

855
00:56:02.141 --> 00:56:06.798
for a level of brutality
that you were used to rejecting

856
00:56:06.841 --> 00:56:08.756
so you could match up
with your dad.

857
00:56:11.368 --> 00:56:16.111
-Mom. This makes no sense.
Please tell me you hear that.

858
00:56:16.155 --> 00:56:21.726
-I know it's unfamiliar. But
it's the simplest thing.

859
00:56:21.769 --> 00:56:23.902
You're going to be the host

860
00:56:23.945 --> 00:56:26.600
for the soul
of the greatest prophet

861
00:56:26.644 --> 00:56:29.864
the world has ever known:
your father.

862
00:56:32.867 --> 00:56:34.565
Congratulations.

863
00:56:39.613 --> 00:56:42.399
-PAUL: Wendell!
-No. no. no. no. no. no!

864
00:56:44.923 --> 00:56:46.490
Let me go! Let me go!

[breathing heavily]

866
00:56:49.231 --> 00:56:52.321
Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom?

867
00:56:52.365 --> 00:56:53.932
-Let's get you
cleaned up. okay?

868
00:56:53.975 --> 00:56:56.021
Everything will
look brighter then.

869
00:56:57.631 --> 00:57:01.113
Shhhh.

870
00:57:01.156 --> 00:57:04.377
Good girl. baby girl.
Good girl.

871

-[breathing heavily]

00:57:11.515 --> 00:57:14.779
[breathes deeply]

873
00:57:29.663 --> 00:57:32.797
-Oh. good. You're awake.

874
00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:36.583
We have a ton to get through
before nightfall.

875
00:57:36.627 --> 00:57:38.933
-Mom. what are you doing?
What--what's going on?

876
00:57:38.977 --> 00:57:41.109
-My first question
for you is.

877
00:57:41.153 --> 00:57:43.634
are you on your period?

878
00:57:43.677 --> 00:57:46.245
-Why? What is this for?

879
00:57:46.288 --> 00:57:47.464
-Are you menstruating.
yes or no?

880
00:57:47.507 --> 00:57:50.118
We need to be quick here.

881
00:57:50.162 --> 00:57:51.729
-No.
No. don't you remember

882
00:57:51.772 --> 00:57:54.775
when I took your last tampon
two weeks ago?

883
00:57:54.819 --> 00:57:58.431
-I do. But these are
for your father.

884
00:57:58.475 --> 00:58:00.825
-Why does he need to know
if I'm having my period?

885
00:58:03.915 --> 00:58:05.525
-I'd appreciate
if you would pee in here

886
00:58:05.569 --> 00:58:08.702
and let me see the toilet paper.
just to be sure.

887
00:58:12.314 --> 00:58:13.838
-Absolutely not.

888
00:58:16.971 --> 00:58:18.625
-I know this all
seems strange but. believe me.

889
00:58:18.669 --> 00:58:20.758
it's in your own best interest
to cooperate.

890
00:58:27.025 --> 00:58:30.507
-If I pee for you. will
you answer a question for me?

891
00:58:30.550 --> 00:58:32.291
As my mom?

What did he have to do to you

897
00:59:10.111 --> 00:59:12.461
to convince
you to do this to me?

898
00:59:12.505 --> 00:59:13.898
-Nothing.

899
00:59:15.377 --> 00:59:18.337
I'd do anything for him.

900
00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:21.166
And it's not "to" you.
It's for you.

901
00:59:22.646 --> 00:59:25.562
-You wouldn't do
anything for me?

902
00:59:25.605 --> 00:59:28.695
-It's different.

903
00:59:28.739 --> 00:59:30.218
Is it possible
that you're not menstruating

904
00:59:30.262 --> 00:59:32.699
because you're pregnant?

905
00:59:32.743 --> 00:59:34.396
-I'm sorry?

906
00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:36.050
-Just answer the question.

907
00:59:36.094 --> 00:59:38.183
-Mom. you know
the answer to that.

908
00:59:38.226 --> 00:59:39.663
-I need to
hear you to say it.

909
00:59:41.099 --> 00:59:42.622
-No.

910
00:59:42.666 --> 00:59:46.191

I'm pregnant.

-Where were you for the
last three years of high school

914
00:59:54.112 --> 00:59:55.722
while I cried to you
that I couldn't get a date

915
00:59:55.766 --> 00:59:58.029
because everyone thought
I was weird?

916
01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:02.511
-I'll take that as a yes.

917

-Yes or no?

-No. I like boys.
they just don't like me.

921

to a virginity test.

are you fucking kidding me?

923

those tests are bullshit.

That wasn't me.

935

I told her to you
as a bedtime story

936

so you could fall asleep
at night.

-That depends entirely
on how the ritual goes.

-So. if it fails...

966
01:03:28.021 --> 01:03:29.544
-If the soul
rejects the vessel.

967
01:03:29.588 --> 01:03:31.851
then the vessel is corrupt.
and we must...

968
01:03:31.895 --> 01:03:33.374
we must dispose of it.

969
01:03:35.899 --> 01:03:37.378
-And what happens to you?

970
01:03:39.511 --> 01:03:40.817

if you don't do

and do it now.

01:03:42.731 --> 01:03:43.863
I'm going to lose both you

973
01:03:43.907 --> 01:03:45.343

if you do what I say.

they've all failed?

-I was never pretending.

-Did you meet him?
Behind my back?

998
01:06:52.399 --> 01:06:56.316
-Never.
He told me to wait.

about him. though.

1002

And never told me.

1003
01:07:21.428 --> 01:07:23.474
He doesn't love you.

1004

-It doesn't matter.

1005

-But I do.

1006

You took and you took.

1009
01:07:53.156 --> 01:07:56.724
and you never
gave any of it back.

-Are you kidding?

1011
01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:03.340
All I ever did
was take care of you.

Paul would kill me.

you wanted to hear. Karma?

some privacy. though?

I have a present for you.

1035

Your father and I
would like you to wear this.

1036

And then you can put the mask on

1037

and go out to the yard
and we'll meet you there.

You know. after everything
he's done for you today.

1039

I think you could stand
to lose the attitude.

You're lucky to have a father
who wanted you.

And sometimes
we have to sacrifice.

You think it was easy for me to
raise you alone with no money?

I didn't get it done

that fate dealt us.

you'll put on the dress
when I tell you to.

1050
