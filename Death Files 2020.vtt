58
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.820
Human souls became too dirty.

59
00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:29.580
Sinful. Perverse.

60
00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:35.920
Pain. Violence. Malice. All this burns through their souls.

61
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:52.060
Probably not a single person remained with a pure and immaculate soul.

62
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.860
All people strive to sin.

63
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.960
Create madness.

64
00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.400
Are there people who have not sinned?

65
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.120
I think. no.

66
00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:18.320
Each person has his own little and terrible secret. which he will try to hide from everyone.

67
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:41.300
They still have the mafia. Just think about it. Where they live all their lives and sin all their lives.

68
00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:48.520
They like to rape. rob. torture. kill.

69
00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:52.680
All this madness is terrible sins.

70
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:57.460
Dirty. vicious human souls.

71
00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.720
A pure soul. Oh yeah.

72
00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.880
Oh. God.

73
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.040
What is this place?

74
00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:03.260
God. I do not know where I am.

75
00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.160
I urgently need help. It doesn’t catch the connection.

76
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.660
I hope someone finds this phone. That’s all I found there.

77
00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:14.500
I don't know what is this place.

78
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:18.840
I was running away. Some maniac was chasing me.

79
00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.340
I do not know what to do. I just want to get out of there.

80
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.500
This is some kind of garage.

81
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.120
Closed.

82
00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.980
Damn.

83
00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.540
I can't get out of here.

84
00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.840
Someone is going there.

85
00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.220
Damn.

86
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.240
God. Someone came in there.

87
00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.820
No.

88
00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:37.980
To the glory of Satan.

89
00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:39.940
I killed all peole.

90
00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.380
All are dead.

91
00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.940
Smelly freak.

92
00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:50.420
You can't beat me.

93
00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.520
You are alive.

94
00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:02.540
Ball. Tell me. kill him or let run.

95
00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:10.660
Bad deeds. So it says kill.

96
00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:21.120
Go away from me! You decided to deal with me. Hold on.

97
00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:29.860
What's you doing?

98
00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:52.360
You didn’t succeed in stopping me. and it will never come out.

99
00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:31.660
Did you leave a cigarette here?

100
00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:34.500
Or the one who killed you?

101
00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:50.060
Wow. Christmas tree. Footwear.

102
00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.260
What happened there?

103
00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:58.100
Is there was hospital or medical building?

104
00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:01.380
Hey. Where are you?

105
00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.900
Here you are caught.

106
00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.200
Ball. What do you tell me?

107
00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:52.340
Kill!

108
00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.900
Somehow bad.

109
00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:25.340
You are dead!

110
00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:29.060
I killed you!

111
00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.560
Hooray! Hooray!

112
00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:17.060
If someone sees this video. then maybe I'm no longer alive.

113
00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:20.480
My name is Svetlakova Inna.

114
00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:31.640
I borned in 1995.

115
00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:37.120
I was kidnapped from club.

116
00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:47.740
I was at a meeting with friends of classmates.

117
00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:54.180
We went out to smoke and unknown people kidnapped me.

118
00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:59.000
For a long time I was in slavery.

119
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.340
I was transported from place to place. I do not know where am I.

120
00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:10.420
This is very terrible. I really want to go home.

121
00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.420
I think. this is my last day.

122
00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:24.520
They told me that I no longer fit them.

123
00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:27.880
Most likely. they will sell me to organs.

124
00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:38.400
I do not know what will happen next. Most likely. I will not see more relatives.

125
00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:45.280
Please. If anyone sees this video.

126
00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:51.700
Say my relatives. that last time I lay in the couch.

127
00:25:55.340 --> 00:26:01.720
The government knows all this. so it’s useless to report it to anyone at the police or elsewhere.

128
00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:15.420
Once. I managed to escape. I went to the policeman. He promised to help me. but in fact he just handed me back to this prison.

129
00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:22.800
I do not know what it's called. We are locked in the basement all the time.

130
00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:28.560
Today. they will let me into another room. Here is this room.

131
00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.560
Tell my mother that I love her very much.

132
00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:31.220
What am I watching? Who filmed this?

133
00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:47.920
It’s necessary to calm down! It’s necessary to calm down! It’s necessary to calm down!

134
00:32:49.840 --> 00:33:01.380
In the city of Astrakhan. something terrible happened in an ordinary village lake. This was exactly the headline of the newspaper that old grandfather Semyon read.

135
00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:11.260
He looked at his native lake and threw the newspaper out the window. He hated mysticism and did not want to read about it in the newspapers.

136
00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:21.440
But he inaccurately threw a cigarette butt and his wooden house caught fire. He ran to the lake to get water and put out the fire and save his wife. but disappeared.

137
00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:26.080
The wife was saved. She began to search for her husband. but could not find.

138
00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:31.640
The police arrived and was able to find the corpse of her husband.

139
00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:38.860
They could recognize him only by the ring on his hand.

140
00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:49.380
Local old people began to say that an ancient monster had awakened.

141
00:33:49.380 --> 00:34:04.940
A few months later there was a flood. Semyonych. believed that the water would not reach him and laughed. but soon he was already standing head over heels in the water in his house.

142
00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:12.760
A creature resembling a shark swam into the house and devoured Semyonitch.

143
00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:20.140
His wife told me about this because she was able to escape.

144
00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:31.760
She spoke about a humanoid shark whose body was covered with sores and other things.

145
00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:43.640
What kind of creature was this? Ancient monster? The man who sewed his fins?

146
00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:51.620
We will never know this. and the mystery of the Astrakhan Lake will terrorize its inhabitants until the end of time.

147
00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:55.780
No. No. I can’t stand it.

148
00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.600
All. I can’t watch it.

149
00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:16.560
My name is Edgar Black. Today. I lost all.

150
00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.740
Family.

151
00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:22.900
Work.

152
00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:25.520
Friends.

153
00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.500
And home.

154
00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:15.580
My name is Edgar Black. Today. I lost all.

155
00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:25.620
Family. friends. work and home.

156
00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:52.840
My name is Edgar Black. Today. I lost all. Family. work. friends and home.

157
00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:20.180
But this day is funnyest day in my live.

158
00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:24.120
Because I became...

159
00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:27.600
...Devil.

160
00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:00.200
Who is this people?

161
00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:05.540
