3
00:01:32.426 --> 00:01:36.471
Come on. Sally. I can't be late.
I'm the one who scheduled this practice.

4
00:01:36.555 --> 00:01:38.390
Right behind you. big brother.

5
00:01:44.188 --> 00:01:45.564
Heads up!

6
00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:47.316
Good morning. Charlie Brown.

7
00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.527
Good morning. Linus. Lucy.
Are you ready for today's practice?

8
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:54.114
Why do we even bother with practice?
We never win any games.

9
00:01:54.198 --> 00:01:56.658
That's exactly why. I'm tired of losing.

10
00:01:56.742 --> 00:01:58.535
Look at it this way. Charlie Brown.

11
00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.580
we learn more from losing
than we do from winning.

12
00:02:01.663 --> 00:02:04.750
That must make me
the smartest person in the world.

13
00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:08.503
Aren't you going to say good morning
to me. my Sweet Babboo?

14
00:02:08.586 --> 00:02:10.839
I'm not your Sweet Babboo!

15
00:02:10.923 --> 00:02:12.758
What's the plan. Charlie Brown?

16
00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:15.928
New uniforms? New playbook?
A new quarterback?

17
00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:18.055
No. a new coach.

18
00:02:19.014 --> 00:02:21.558
Maybe you're not such
a blockhead after all.

19
00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:35.322
- Good morning. sir.
- Good morning. Marcie.

20
00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:37.115
I've been reading up on football.

21
00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:40.160
I'm ready to get out there
and kick around the old hogskin.

22
00:02:40.244 --> 00:02:43.580
It's pigskin. Marcie.
And everything isn't "old" in football.

23
00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:44.915
Whatever you say. sir.

24
00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:47.876
And don't call me "sir."
Today it's "Coach."

25
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.211
All right. listen up.

26
00:02:51.755 --> 00:02:57.052
Chuck here has asked me to help his team
get in shape for next season.

27
00:02:57.135 --> 00:02:59.429
Nothing like a good challenge.

28
00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:02.474
Ready to get to work? Good.

29
00:03:02.558 --> 00:03:05.561
I like to start my warm-ups
with 100 jumping jacks.

30
00:03:05.644 --> 00:03:06.770
Marcie?

31
00:03:06.854 --> 00:03:08.814
You heard her. Jump!

32
00:03:11.567 --> 00:03:14.027
One. two. three.

33
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:19.783
four. five. six. seven. eight. nine. ten.

34
00:03:19.867 --> 00:03:21.910
11. 12. 13…

35
00:03:21.994 --> 00:03:25.539
- Sorry I'm late. Coach.
- Hope you have a good excuse. Pigpen.

36
00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:33.964
I do. The line at the candy store sure was
backed up due to Mother's Day tomorrow.

37
00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:36.300
What?

38
00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:40.012
That's tomorrow? I can't believe
I almost forgot Mother's Day.

39
00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:42.306
Mother's Day? Mother's Day is special.

40
00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:43.807
Cut the chitchat. Chuck.

41
00:03:43.891 --> 00:03:45.267
Marcie. where were we?

42
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.561
I lost count.

43
00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:49.104
Forget it.

44
00:03:49.188 --> 00:03:52.482
Time for a little demonstration.
What you're about to see

45
00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:56.570
is some real down-in-the-dirt.
slam-bang. rock-'em-sock-'em football.

46
00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:57.946
Marcie. bring 'em in.

47
00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:05.078
Keep your eyes on
the kid with the funny nose.

48
00:04:05.162 --> 00:04:07.122
Look at those moves.

49
00:04:07.206 --> 00:04:09.166
Okay. kid. Enough with the moves.

50
00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:14.505
Let's start with a simple kick.

51
00:04:14.588 --> 00:04:16.005
All right. tee it up!

52
00:04:23.764 --> 00:04:25.390
Nice hit. little guy.

53
00:04:25.474 --> 00:04:29.144
Shake it off. Forget the kick.
Let's do the passing play.

54
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.733
I never know what my mother would like.
You're clever. Linus. What are you doing?

55
00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:38.487
Well. every day my mom puts
these little notes in my lunch sack.

56
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.696
just like this one.

57
00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:43.659
"Dear Son. study hard.

58
00:04:43.742 --> 00:04:45.994
Remember. all you need
to find true happiness

59
00:04:46.078 --> 00:04:47.746
is already there within you.

60
00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:50.415
The lunch is just a bonus. Love. Mom."

61
00:04:51.375 --> 00:04:53.210
She gets carried away sometimes.

62
00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:55.587
Now go straight out and cut right.

63
00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:58.632
Now left. Now cut back.

64
00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:06.682
Don't come back.
It's a pass. not a return.

65
00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:10.561
This year. I decided to write
a special letter back to thank her.

66
00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:13.564
Unfortunately.
I still need to figure out what to say.

67
00:05:13.647 --> 00:05:16.191
Writing is not really my strong suit.

68
00:05:16.275 --> 00:05:18.777
"Roses are-- Violets are"--

69
00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:24.283
This isn't the play! Tackle that guy.

70
00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:26.034
Can he even hear me?

71
00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:28.412
What are you guys doing?

72
00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:32.541
I'm making Mom a gift
that will be a true artistic masterpiece.

73
00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:34.168
Really? What's that?

74
00:05:34.251 --> 00:05:36.044
If I knew. I'd tell you!

75
00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:40.424
- What are you getting your mom?
- She's been really nice lately.

76
00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:44.136
so I upped her gift
to a crisp five-dollar bill.

77
00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:45.721
How thoughtful of you.

78
00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:47.139
Cold. hard cash.

79
00:05:47.222 --> 00:05:49.474
You don't have the ball.

80
00:05:50.184 --> 00:05:52.144
I'm writing a sonata for my mom.

81
00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:56.148
I call it. "You're the Best Mom."
in F major.

82
00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:57.399
My mom loves hugs.

83
00:05:57.482 --> 00:06:00.110
so I'm making her
a coupon book full of them.

84
00:06:00.194 --> 00:06:02.821
Stop! Look behind you.

85
00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:11.330
Not bad for a little guy. Run! Go. go go!

86
00:06:15.042 --> 00:06:16.919
Yeah!

87
00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:19.671
Not pretty. but it's a touchdown!

88
00:06:19.755 --> 00:06:22.090
Did you get all… that?

89
00:06:22.174 --> 00:06:23.759
- Mother's Day.
- Happy Mother's Day.

90
00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:25.135
Isn't Mother's Day the best?

91
00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:27.346
- Happy Mother's Day.
- I love Mother's Day.

92
00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:33.060
May I have your attention?

93
00:06:33.644 --> 00:06:37.064
Unless you all have something better
you'd rather be doing?

94
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.527
Actually. I need to go
to the craft store for art supplies.

95
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.070
I need to make more coupons.

96
00:06:43.153 --> 00:06:45.781
I still have to work on the last movement
of my sonata.

97
00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:48.825
A card would go nicely
with my box of chocolates.

98
00:06:49.368 --> 00:06:51.203
I should be writing my letter.

99
00:06:54.373 --> 00:06:57.000
Sorry. Coach. I should go too.

100
00:06:57.084 --> 00:06:59.628
I'll call you to set up
another practice soon.

101
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.007
All right. go ahead and leave.

102
00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:06.760
But don't blame me
when you lose next season.

103
00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:16.228
At least someone isn't distracted
by stupid Mother's Day.

104
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:24.152
You too? Everyone deserted me.

105
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.531
Not everyone. Coach. Sir.

106
00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:49.256
Now. here's the sneaky part.

107
00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:52.759
I turn back and do a fake-o pass
to the running back.

108
00:09:52.843 --> 00:09:55.137
But then I keep the ball to myself.

109
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.973
do a few tricky moves
to avoid the other side.

110
00:09:58.056 --> 00:10:00.934
and run down the field for a touchdown.

111
00:10:01.018 --> 00:10:02.227
Sir…

112
00:10:03.729 --> 00:10:05.772
This is all very interesting. sir.

113
00:10:05.856 --> 00:10:08.692
but maybe we should do this
when the other players are here.

114
00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:12.613
No. I refuse to change my plans
just because of Mother's Day.

115
00:10:13.447 --> 00:10:16.450
Maybe we could find something else
that's fun to do.

116
00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:18.493
Who says I'm not having fun?

117
00:10:18.577 --> 00:10:21.955
Is this the face of a person
not having fun?

118
00:10:24.166 --> 00:10:26.668
- Do you want to talk about it. sir?
- No.

119
00:10:33.217 --> 00:10:36.011
Sir. I'm really sorry
you don't have a mom.

120
00:10:36.094 --> 00:10:39.014
I just don't understand
why Mother's Day's such a big deal.

121
00:10:39.097 --> 00:10:41.391
Mother's Day is… dumb!

122
00:10:51.318 --> 00:10:54.988
It's nice that we've opened up
this line of communication. sir.

123
00:11:10.629 --> 00:11:12.548
You should just go home. Marcie.

124
00:11:12.631 --> 00:11:15.634
I'm sure you have some things
you need to prepare for tomorrow.

125
00:11:15.717 --> 00:11:19.096
Taken care of. sir. I made cupcakes.

126
00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:21.265
I would rather stay here with you.

127
00:11:23.475 --> 00:11:25.435
It's the same every year.

128
00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:29.523
I'm having a good day.
and then someone brings up Mother's Day.

129
00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:33.986
And suddenly I'm reminded that
I'm the only kid who doesn't have a mom.

130
00:11:34.653 --> 00:11:36.780
It must be difficult. sir.

131
00:11:36.864 --> 00:11:38.490
It really is. Marcie.

132
00:11:46.957 --> 00:11:48.917
Last year. I pretended to be sick

133
00:11:49.001 --> 00:11:51.253
so I didn't have to go
to school that week.

134
00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:54.673
I remember. You came down
with a case of the yuckies.

135
00:11:57.885 --> 00:12:00.888
If you want.
you can spend Mother's Day at my house.

136
00:12:00.971 --> 00:12:02.639
I don't mind sharing my mom.

137
00:12:03.307 --> 00:12:06.727
Your mom's nice.
but it's just not the same.

138
00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:09.313
Is there anything I can do to help?

139
00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:12.357
I don't know. Marcie.

140
00:12:12.441 --> 00:12:16.028
Can you make Mother's Day go away
and never come back again?

141
00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.739
I'm afraid not. sir.

142
00:12:19.448 --> 00:12:21.033
I didn't think so.

143
00:12:25.162 --> 00:12:27.122
Let's go return Chuck's football.

144
00:12:29.416 --> 00:12:32.753
"To my mom." No.

145
00:12:33.295 --> 00:12:36.924
"Mommy dearest." No.

146
00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:40.093
"O mother of mine."

147
00:12:43.305 --> 00:12:44.473
"Hey. Mom."

148
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:48.227
Letter writing is a lost art.

149
00:12:49.853 --> 00:12:50.854
"Mother."

150
00:12:51.355 --> 00:12:53.065
Move over. Linus.

151
00:12:53.148 --> 00:12:56.443
I need the table to make
my special Mother's Day present.

152
00:13:02.074 --> 00:13:05.410
It's going to be a portrait of Mom
done in watercolor.

153
00:13:05.494 --> 00:13:07.996
She's going to take one look at it
and say.

154
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.707
"That picture belongs
at the top of the fridge."

155
00:13:10.791 --> 00:13:12.501
Sounds like a great idea.

156
00:13:12.584 --> 00:13:15.254
I believe the best gifts
come from the heart.

157
00:13:15.337 --> 00:13:18.131
Heart. schmeart. This is art.

158
00:13:18.632 --> 00:13:24.179
Being a great artist means
having discipline. concentration.

159
00:13:24.263 --> 00:13:27.349
and never rushing your masterpiece.

160
00:13:27.432 --> 00:13:28.684
Done!

161
00:13:31.103 --> 00:13:33.021
Have you looked at Mom recently?

162
00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:40.612
I think I'll make something else.
Something inspired.

163
00:13:41.238 --> 00:13:45.117
There's a fine line
between honest and too honest.

164
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:49.872
Aren't you going to ring the doorbell?

165
00:13:49.955 --> 00:13:51.707
I don't want to see anybody.

166
00:13:53.667 --> 00:13:55.669
Do you want to borrow my handkerchief?

167
00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.214
I'm not crying. I'm thinking.

168
00:13:59.298 --> 00:14:02.426
They sort of look like
the same thing sometimes.

169
00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:04.678
Well. it's here if you want it.

170
00:14:08.932 --> 00:14:11.101
I don't know why I get so upset.

171
00:14:11.685 --> 00:14:13.854
Maybe because you miss your mom?

172
00:14:13.937 --> 00:14:16.940
I never had a mom. How could I miss her?

173
00:14:17.608 --> 00:14:19.943
Well. maybe you miss what moms do.

174
00:14:20.027 --> 00:14:22.070
like making your favorite cookies

175
00:14:22.154 --> 00:14:24.656
and putting a bandage on your finger
when you have a cut

176
00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.200
and singing your favorite song?

177
00:14:26.283 --> 00:14:27.618
I don't miss those things.

178
00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:31.747
My dad does all that mom stuff for me.
He's the best.

179
00:14:32.748 --> 00:14:34.499
Your dad is very nice.

180
00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:37.461
Are you okay. sir?

181
00:14:38.003 --> 00:14:41.256
Marcie.
there are all types of moms. right?

182
00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:44.593
Of course. Foster kids have terrific moms.

183
00:14:44.676 --> 00:14:48.180
So do adopted kids.
Some kids even have two moms.

184
00:14:48.263 --> 00:14:53.560
Right. And even kids like me. with no mom.
can have someone who acts like a mom.

185
00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:57.898
And all those moms deserve
to be celebrated. don't you think?

186
00:14:57.981 --> 00:14:59.233
Sure they do.

187
00:14:59.733 --> 00:15:01.610
Well. that's what I'm gonna do.

188
00:15:01.693 --> 00:15:04.738
For Mother's Day.
I'm going to celebrate my dad.

189
00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:06.198
It's so simple.

190
00:15:06.281 --> 00:15:09.826
All I have to do is get him
one of those Mother's Day gifts.

191
00:15:11.787 --> 00:15:12.996
Like a card?

192
00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.707
Yes. that's it! A card!

193
00:15:15.791 --> 00:15:20.128
I get him a card. And bang!
No more yuckies. Problem solved.

194
00:15:20.212 --> 00:15:22.589
Marcie. you're a genius!

195
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:24.091
I am?

196
00:15:30.138 --> 00:15:33.016
I can't believe
it's already Mother's Day tomorrow.

197
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.644
Wasn't it just Mother's Day last year?

198
00:15:35.727 --> 00:15:37.354
It happens every year.

199
00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:40.983
But stay focused. Sally.
We need to think of a special gift.

200
00:15:56.957 --> 00:15:59.084
Sally. I think I have a plan.

201
00:15:59.168 --> 00:16:01.587
What does Mom always say
is her favorite meal?

202
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:03.505
The one she doesn't have to cook.

203
00:16:03.589 --> 00:16:04.631
Exactly.

204
00:16:04.715 --> 00:16:08.468
Well. tomorrow we're going to
make her breakfast in bed.

205
00:16:08.552 --> 00:16:10.596
Won't that make her sheets soggy?

206
00:16:10.679 --> 00:16:15.184
I don't think you understand
the finer details of breakfast in bed.

207
00:16:15.267 --> 00:16:18.395
It's served on a tray.
and it's very classy.

208
00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:20.105
It sounds messy to me.

209
00:16:20.189 --> 00:16:22.524
Trust me. she's going to love it.

210
00:16:22.608 --> 00:16:24.693
But we should do a test run first.

211
00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:27.446
Bring me the good plates
from the china cabinet.

212
00:16:27.529 --> 00:16:29.239
Aye. aye. big brother.

213
00:17:05.776 --> 00:17:07.194
Wha--

214
00:17:14.159 --> 00:17:17.496
I thought you said
breakfast in bed wasn't messy.

215
00:17:19.665 --> 00:17:21.165
Good grief.

216
00:20:15.632 --> 00:20:17.885
We have arrived. All right.

217
00:20:17.968 --> 00:20:20.220
We're looking for a Mother's Day card
that says.

218
00:20:20.304 --> 00:20:23.015
"Thanks. Dad.
for being such a good mother."

219
00:20:23.098 --> 00:20:25.601
That sounds… logical.

220
00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:30.355
"Dear Mother.
your smile brightens my day." No.

221
00:20:30.439 --> 00:20:32.941
"Dear Mother. my love for you"--

222
00:20:33.984 --> 00:20:37.404
"To a mother sweeter than sugar."
Not that one either.

223
00:20:37.487 --> 00:20:39.698
Where are the Mother's Day cards
he'd like?

224
00:20:39.781 --> 00:20:43.452
Some trucks or sports
or a little bit of flannel?

225
00:20:43.535 --> 00:20:45.996
These are all flowery and mushy.

226
00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:48.624
"Mother. O Mother!" Oh. brother.

227
00:20:48.707 --> 00:20:50.375
No. Never. Nope.

228
00:20:55.714 --> 00:20:58.926
I don't believe it.
There's nothing here for my dad.

229
00:20:59.009 --> 00:21:00.594
Have you seen any cards that say.

230
00:21:00.677 --> 00:21:03.764
"Happy Mother's Day
to the world's greatest grandma"?

231
00:21:03.847 --> 00:21:07.226
I want one that's short and sweet.
just like her.

232
00:21:08.018 --> 00:21:09.228
Good luck with that.

233
00:21:11.688 --> 00:21:14.525
"There is no other like my grandmother.

234
00:21:14.608 --> 00:21:17.861
Happy Mother's Day
to the world's greatest grandma."

235
00:21:17.945 --> 00:21:19.696
This is perfect.

236
00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:22.407
Thank you. Marcie.

237
00:21:24.493 --> 00:21:25.827
Excuse me.

238
00:21:25.911 --> 00:21:29.665
Can you show me where I can find
a Mother's Day card for my father?

239
00:21:32.167 --> 00:21:34.753
Well. you should expand
your card selection.

240
00:21:34.837 --> 00:21:38.632
Not everyone has the same sort
of family. you know. Sheesh.

241
00:21:39.341 --> 00:21:40.384
Marcie.

242
00:21:41.885 --> 00:21:43.053
Sorry.

243
00:21:44.429 --> 00:21:45.430
Come on.

244
00:21:46.306 --> 00:21:47.474
I refuse to give up.

245
00:21:48.016 --> 00:21:49.017
Let's go.

246
00:21:50.185 --> 00:21:51.895
What about ice skates?

247
00:21:51.979 --> 00:21:53.105
He has weak ankles.

248
00:21:53.188 --> 00:21:55.649
- What about flowers?
- He has allergies.

249
00:21:55.732 --> 00:21:59.611
- Some jewelry?
- Nice. but too expensive.

250
00:21:59.695 --> 00:22:00.696
How about a cake?

251
00:22:00.779 --> 00:22:03.031
He's more of a salty kind of guy.

252
00:22:03.115 --> 00:22:04.408
A day of pampering?

253
00:22:04.491 --> 00:22:05.951
He hates cucumber.

254
00:22:10.205 --> 00:22:11.582
Write him a song?

255
00:22:11.665 --> 00:22:15.586
I give up. This is impossible.

256
00:24:49.448 --> 00:24:52.826
Don't you think cleaning up the kitchen
counts as a gift?

257
00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:55.787
We're running out of time.
Let's keep looking.

258
00:24:58.582 --> 00:25:00.375
How about an ice cream cake?

259
00:25:02.252 --> 00:25:04.713
Actually. that's not a bad idea.

260
00:25:10.886 --> 00:25:12.721
One ice cream cake. please.

261
00:25:14.681 --> 00:25:16.141
- Strawberry.
- Strawberry.

262
00:25:16.934 --> 00:25:18.185
Make it…

263
00:25:18.268 --> 00:25:19.978
- Large.
- Large. please.

264
00:25:24.107 --> 00:25:28.070
Sally. I'm a little short.
Do you have any money?

265
00:25:30.155 --> 00:25:31.990
From one mess to another.

266
00:25:36.787 --> 00:25:39.998
You know. Mother's Day is just
another commercial scam.

267
00:25:41.542 --> 00:25:42.543
Thank you. sir.

268
00:25:43.085 --> 00:25:46.797
Should I assume you won't be eating
any of this commercial scam?

269
00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.465
Of course I will.

270
00:25:48.549 --> 00:25:52.511
When ice cream is involved.
my principles are totally negotiable.

271
00:26:01.854 --> 00:26:05.732
I suppose you're wondering
where I got this beautiful crown.

272
00:26:05.816 --> 00:26:07.276
It certainly crossed my mind.

273
00:26:07.359 --> 00:26:09.319
I made it to give to my mom tomorrow.

274
00:26:09.403 --> 00:26:12.197
so she can feel what it's like
to be queen for a day.

275
00:26:12.281 --> 00:26:15.075
I'm testing it out.
and it feels very good.

276
00:26:16.159 --> 00:26:18.287
I'm never going to find something
for my da--

277
00:26:20.914 --> 00:26:24.877
Mother's Day. Mother's Day…
Everywhere I go. that's all I hear.

278
00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:29.965
I think if I hear "Mother's Day"
one more time. I'll-- I'll scream.

279
00:26:30.048 --> 00:26:32.301
We got my mom an ice cream cake
for Mother's Day.

280
00:26:32.384 --> 00:26:36.471
I was going to get her a vanilla cake
or a chocolate cake for Mother's Day.

281
00:26:37.639 --> 00:26:39.766
But Sally suggested strawberry.

282
00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:42.686
And that seemed like the perfect flavor
for Mother's Day.

283
00:26:42.769 --> 00:26:47.107
Mother's Day. Mother's Day.

284
00:27:05.959 --> 00:27:08.504
It's ruined! Look what you did!

285
00:27:10.547 --> 00:27:12.883
Sorry. Lucille.

286
00:27:12.966 --> 00:27:15.427
Chuck. It's just--

287
00:27:17.262 --> 00:27:18.430
No time to explain.

288
00:27:19.598 --> 00:27:21.016
Sir. come back.

289
00:27:21.517 --> 00:27:24.728
Apparently Mother's Day
is not her favorite holiday.

290
00:27:30.234 --> 00:27:32.861
- Sir? Where are you going?
- Home.

291
00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:40.702
All I wanted to do was get my dad
a Mother's Day gift. I couldn't do that.

292
00:27:40.786 --> 00:27:42.412
- Maybe we can--
- No. Marcie.

293
00:27:42.496 --> 00:27:44.915
Whatever you're going to say.
I don't want to hear it.

294
00:27:44.998 --> 00:27:47.960
Every time you try to help.
I end up feeling worse.

295
00:27:48.043 --> 00:27:51.547
I'm sorry. sir.
That was never my intention.

296
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:55.592
Mother's Day has always been bad for me.
and that's never going to change.

297
00:27:55.676 --> 00:27:58.136
So please. leave me alone.

298
00:30:15.899 --> 00:30:18.735
I bet ants don't have to
celebrate Mother's Day.

299
00:30:20.988 --> 00:30:22.823
Lucky ants.

300
00:30:23.365 --> 00:30:25.284
Ants are lucky. I suppose.

301
00:30:25.784 --> 00:30:28.287
They always seem to know
where they fit in.

302
00:30:30.122 --> 00:30:33.417
Every now and then. my dad says to me.

303
00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:36.336
"Peppermint Patty.
do you know what you are?"

304
00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:38.088
And I always say no.

305
00:30:38.172 --> 00:30:44.428
Then he says to me. "You are a rare gem."
And then we laugh about it.

306
00:30:44.511 --> 00:30:47.931
But sometimes I wish I wasn't so rare.

307
00:30:48.432 --> 00:30:49.933
I think I understand.

308
00:30:50.475 --> 00:30:54.605
Today everyone was so excited.
More than excited.

309
00:30:54.688 --> 00:30:58.025
They were happy
about celebrating their moms.

310
00:30:58.108 --> 00:31:03.488
And I knew. no matter what I do.
I'll never know how that feels.

311
00:31:03.572 --> 00:31:05.073
And I was angry.

312
00:31:05.657 --> 00:31:09.661
Have you ever thought
maybe your anger is really sadness?

313
00:31:21.006 --> 00:31:22.633
It's okay to cry. sir.

314
00:31:25.969 --> 00:31:27.763
One tear isn't crying.

315
00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:36.480
Maybe you could get your dad
something else.

316
00:31:37.064 --> 00:31:38.607
Don't start that again.

317
00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:41.777
I was thinking. sir.
we tried the usual things.

318
00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:42.861
But you are rare.

319
00:31:42.945 --> 00:31:46.657
Is there something you could give him
that could only come from you?

320
00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:48.325
I don't know.

321
00:31:48.408 --> 00:31:52.120
Well. what are your favorite things
to do together?

322
00:31:53.705 --> 00:31:54.957
Everything.

323
00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:59.211
We play baseball.
He taught me all I know about football.

324
00:31:59.294 --> 00:32:04.466
We like to tell each other dumb jokes.
The dumber they are. the more we laugh.

325
00:32:04.967 --> 00:32:08.720
He loves to hear me laugh.
He says it reminds him of my mom.

326
00:32:11.807 --> 00:32:13.851
I know how to celebrate Mother's Day.

327
00:32:13.934 --> 00:32:16.603
Tomorrow I'll spend the whole day
with my dad.

328
00:32:16.687 --> 00:32:20.649
We'll play and talk to each other.
and I'm gonna make him laugh.

329
00:32:20.732 --> 00:32:22.192
And he'll make me laugh.

330
00:32:22.276 --> 00:32:25.404
And together
we'll share the biggest laugh ever.

331
00:32:25.487 --> 00:32:29.408
That sounds like the best
Mother's Day gift a father has ever had.

332
00:32:29.491 --> 00:32:32.286
Yeah! It does! I gotta go!

333
00:32:33.954 --> 00:32:39.251
Marcie. if I said anything before
to hurt your feelings. I'm sorry.

334
00:32:39.334 --> 00:32:42.004
- You're a true friend.
- You are too. sir.

335
00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:47.801
And wish your mom
a happy Mother's Day for me!

336
00:32:49.178 --> 00:32:50.387
Will do. sir.

337
00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:01.732
This is good.
But is it top-of-the-fridge good?

338
00:33:11.241 --> 00:33:13.744
It's definitely top-of-the-fridge quality.

339
00:33:13.827 --> 00:33:15.871
Thank goodness.

340
00:33:15.954 --> 00:33:18.624
I was starting to think
I had a self-doubt.

341
00:33:18.707 --> 00:33:22.252
- But it's still missing something.
- What? But you just said--

342
00:33:22.336 --> 00:33:25.047
All cards need a message inside.
It's a rule.

343
00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:29.551
Okay. wise guy. What does your letter say?

344
00:33:30.344 --> 00:33:31.345
Here.

345
00:33:37.309 --> 00:33:42.940
Linus. It's--
It's everything I wish I could say.

346
00:33:43.774 --> 00:33:47.611
Well. you know.
my letter needs something to go in.

347
00:33:47.694 --> 00:33:50.197
If you want.
we can put it inside your card

348
00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.282
and give them both to Mom together.

349
00:33:52.366 --> 00:33:53.867
You'd do that?

350
00:33:55.369 --> 00:33:58.288
It just needs one little change here.

351
00:34:04.711 --> 00:34:07.381
"Dear Mom.
I'm writing you this letter to thank you

352
00:34:07.464 --> 00:34:09.675
for the notes you put
in my school lunches.

353
00:34:09.757 --> 00:34:14.721
Also. to thank you for my school lunches.
especially the bologna sandwiches.

354
00:34:14.804 --> 00:34:16.639
not so much the tuna fish."

355
00:34:17.599 --> 00:34:21.436
"This is my way of thanking you
for all the things you do for me.

356
00:34:22.062 --> 00:34:25.482
<i>When I'm scared.
you give me cuddles and act so sweet.</i>

357
00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:30.654
<i>When I'm lonely.
you call me your 'forever best friend.'</i>

358
00:34:30.737 --> 00:34:31.947
<i>I like that.</i>

359
00:34:34.408 --> 00:34:37.494
<i>You always find the time
to listen to my new ideas."</i>

360
00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:45.168
<i>"You give me lots hugs and kisses.
even in front of my friends.</i>

361
00:34:45.252 --> 00:34:48.505
<i>which is sometimes embarrassing.
but I still like them.</i>

362
00:34:49.547 --> 00:34:53.969
<i>When I make mistakes.
you encourage me to try again and again.</i>

363
00:35:00.434 --> 00:35:02.561
<i>You make sure I'm safe every night.</i>

364
00:35:03.645 --> 00:35:06.648
<i>You give me your best
in your own special way."</i>

365
00:35:12.029 --> 00:35:13.322
Go long. Dad.

366
00:35:14.573 --> 00:35:15.908
Nice catch.

367
00:35:16.658 --> 00:35:18.452
Say goodbye to that one. Dad.

368
00:35:18.535 --> 00:35:21.747
Here's another one.
What did the egg say to the chef?

369
00:35:22.331 --> 00:35:23.874
"You crack me up."

370
00:35:24.458 --> 00:35:26.376
<i>"When I'm sad. you make me laugh.</i>

371
00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:29.796
<i>And then you laugh too.
which makes me laugh even more."</i>

372
00:35:31.924 --> 00:35:36.595
"Mostly I know you're someone who loves me
and will always be there for me.

373
00:35:36.678 --> 00:35:40.516
I guess that's what moms do.
But you do it the best. That's why"--

374
00:35:40.599 --> 00:35:42.809
This is where you come in.

375
00:35:42.893 --> 00:35:48.524
We really. really. really love you back.
Happy Mother's Day.
