that there may be some legal repercussions

175
00:09:09.916 --> 00:09:12.250
We're wasting our lives.

176
00:09:12.333 --> 00:09:16.250
Hmm. it's true.
At least we're all in the same boat.

177
00:09:16.333 --> 00:09:20.416

with strange bedfellows."

179
00:09:22.666 --> 00:09:26.541
Okay. one. shut up.
Two. I refuse to give up. okay?

180
00:09:26.625 --> 00:09:30.458
We're… We're still celebrities.
We still have power.

182
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:34.166
Now. The Times
sort of castrated you as it were.

183
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:35.083
[Barry sighs]

184
00:09:35.166 --> 00:09:38.416
Yep. They wrote you off
as aging narcissists.

185
00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.375
I still don't understand
what's wrong with that.

186
00:09:41.458 --> 00:09:45.625
There's a very simple way
that we can still love ourselves

187
00:09:45.708 --> 00:09:50.500
yet appear to be
decent human beings. okay?

188
00:09:50.583 --> 00:09:53.166
We will become celebrity activists.

189
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:55.500
-[Angie] Oh! Brilliant!
-[Barry] Right?

190
00:09:55.583 --> 00:09:57.875
-All we need is a cause.
-A cause célèbre.

191
00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.375
Everybody think of some causes. Go.

192
00:10:00.458 --> 00:10:02.416
-Um. poverty?
-Too big.

193
00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.750
World hunger.

194
00:10:03.833 --> 00:10:07.625
That is also a major thing.
No. we need something we can handle.

195
00:10:07.708 --> 00:10:11.166
Some little injustice
we can drive to. Recycling.

196
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.541
-Let's see what's trending.
-[Barry] Recycling's good.

197
00:10:13.625 --> 00:10:16.833
-Why are there so many award shows?
-Parking.

198
00:10:16.916 --> 00:10:20.000
-[Barry] Or the TVs in the back of cabs.
-Oh! Oh. yeah. what about this girl?

199
00:10:20.875 --> 00:10:22.750
Oh. my gosh. Check this out.

200
00:10:22.833 --> 00:10:24.541
-[Barry] What girl?
-It's all over Twitter.

201
00:10:24.625 --> 00:10:25.458
[Barry] Oh.

202
00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:28.166
She's from Edgewater. Indiana.

203
00:10:29.166 --> 00:10:33.291
She's a lesbian. She wanted to take
her girlfriend to the high school prom.

204
00:10:33.375 --> 00:10:35.958
and the PTA went apeshit
and they canceled it.

205
00:10:36.041 --> 00:10:38.000
They canceled prom?

206
00:10:38.083 --> 00:10:40.125
-Are they allowed to do that?
-No.

207
00:10:40.208 --> 00:10:42.125
[reporter] Principal Hawkins.
your response.

208
00:10:42.208 --> 00:10:45.000
The first thing I'm going to do
is contact the Indiana state's attorney.

209
00:10:45.083 --> 00:10:48.416
This is not about school rules.
This is a civil rights case.

210
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:49.583
Wait. seriously?

211
00:10:49.666 --> 00:10:53.458
I'm betting pressure from the state's
attorney will stop these bigots cold.

212
00:10:53.541 --> 00:10:55.541
It better.
Because I'll tell you this much.

213
00:10:55.625 --> 00:10:58.000
If word gets out.
people are gonna get mad.

214
00:10:58.083 --> 00:10:59.375
This pisses me off.

215
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.500
The next thing you know.
some modern-day Eleanor Roosevelt

216
00:11:02.583 --> 00:11:05.375
is gonna march down here
and all hell's gonna break loose.

217
00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:09.791
We have got to go down there
and raise holy hell.

218
00:11:09.875 --> 00:11:12.333
We will be the biggest thing
to happen in Indiana

219
00:11:12.416 --> 00:11:14.625
since… whatever's happened in Indiana.

220
00:11:14.708 --> 00:11:17.708
-So this is it? This is our cause?
-Yes. Are you with me?

222

341
00:17:50.916 --> 00:17:53.416
-[Angie] You're scaring them.
-They're scaring me.

342
00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.416
How about we do some trust exercises?

343
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.833
-[choir murmuring indistinctly]
-Yeah? Good.

344
00:17:57.916 --> 00:18:02.833
Hotel is booked. Breakfast isn't included.
but there is a Waffle Shed next door.

345
00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:04.750
-Sounds delicious.
-[Angie] Mmm-hmm.

346
00:18:04.833 --> 00:18:09.083
We're doing a great thing here.
We're being great people.

347
00:18:09.166 --> 00:18:10.958
This is all great. [chuckles]

348
00:18:12.083 --> 00:18:14.750
This is gonna get me my third Tony Award.

349
00:18:14.833 --> 00:18:17.083
-[scoffs] Oh. my God.
-What?

350
00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:22.000
Oh. come on. you know
how political the Tonys are.

351
00:18:22.083 --> 00:18:25.041
They don't vote for you.
They vote for your brand.

352
00:18:25.125 --> 00:18:28.208
My brand is
a little tarnished at the moment.

353
00:18:28.291 --> 00:18:30.708
'Cause of the infamous tirade
at the Longacre Theatre?

354
00:18:30.791 --> 00:18:34.083
When a cell phone goes off
in the middle of a performance…

355
00:18:34.166 --> 00:18:36.291
-I can't be held responsible.
-It was your cell phone!

356
00:18:36.375 --> 00:18:38.958
-I didn't know that!
-It was in your wig!

357
00:18:39.041 --> 00:18:41.375
I didn't know that at the time. Anyway…

358
00:18:42.041 --> 00:18:47.291
All the goodwill that we're gonna get
from this thing will wash me clean.

359
00:18:47.375 --> 00:18:51.333
and I will win. no matter what
my next project is. [chuckles]

360
00:18:51.416 --> 00:18:54.291
You're just greedy.
I'd be happy with one Tony.

361
00:18:54.375 --> 00:18:57.458
-I thought I had a shot with FDR.
-Mmm-hmm.

362
00:18:57.541 --> 00:18:59.208
I need a win.

363
00:18:59.291 --> 00:19:02.833
I'm so sick of all the rejection.
I'm no Dee Dee Allen.

364
00:19:02.916 --> 00:19:05.541
-A lot of bile.
-Well. I'm angry at life.

365
00:19:05.625 --> 00:19:07.958
No. I mean Trent. He's retching again.

366
00:19:08.625 --> 00:19:11.333
You were saying something about your…

367
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.625
I got into this business.
yes. because I loved it.

368
00:19:14.708 --> 00:19:17.875
but also to prove
to everyone who doubted me.

369
00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:23.375
my… teachers. the kids
on the school bus. my horrible parents.

370
00:19:23.458 --> 00:19:26.000
that I could do something.
Something important.

371
00:19:26.625 --> 00:19:29.875
[exhales]
That's exactly what we are doing.

372
00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.208
Something important.

373
00:19:33.375 --> 00:19:35.416
I just hope we don't screw it up.

374
00:19:37.666 --> 00:19:38.958
[Angie] Hit it.

375
00:19:39.041 --> 00:19:40.666

380
00:19:51.833 --> 00:19:55.291
I'm sorry. you're telling us
that the state's attorney

381
00:19:55.375 --> 00:19:57.875
is forcing us to have a prom?

382
00:19:57.958 --> 00:20:01.875
No. the state's attorney
wants us to hold an inclusive prom.

383
00:20:01.958 --> 00:20:03.333
-Yes.
-[audience murmurs]

384
00:20:03.416 --> 00:20:06.875
Because that's what they feel
best reflects America's values.

385
00:20:06.958 --> 00:20:10.208
Well. this isn't America. This is Indiana.

[audience applauds]

387
00:20:11.666 --> 00:20:12.708
All right.

388
00:20:16.208 --> 00:20:19.000
Just to be clear. this is America

389
00:20:19.083 --> 00:20:22.458
and everyone gets to have an opinion--
Oh. just like you.

390
00:20:22.541 --> 00:20:23.958
[microphone feedback squeals]

391
00:20:27.041 --> 00:20:29.666
My son will not be forced
to go to a homosexual prom.

[audience applauds]

393
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.083
Thank you. Beverly! Thank you!

394
00:20:34.166 --> 00:20:37.666
Again. it is not a homosexual prom.
It is an inclusive prom…

395
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:40.083
-With homosexuals.
-You don't have to attend--

396
00:20:40.625 --> 00:20:43.083
You don't have to attend
if you don't want to.

397
00:20:43.166 --> 00:20:46.833
Look… I… I'm sorry you're upset.

398
00:20:46.916 --> 00:20:51.125
but the organization of the prom is
within the purview of the student council.

399
00:20:51.208 --> 00:20:54.291
Let's hear what they have to say. Alyssa?

400
00:20:54.375 --> 00:20:56.916
-Uh… Okay.
-[scattered applause]

401

[feedback whines]

402
00:20:58.666 --> 00:21:01.833
Well. we want prom to go on. obviously.

403
00:21:04.125 --> 00:21:07.375
It's supposed to be
a celebration of all students--

404
00:21:07.458 --> 00:21:09.458
Okay. No. thank you. It's fine. everyone.

405
00:21:09.541 --> 00:21:14.208
Sweetheart. I'm so sorry.
but this is not a student matter.

406
00:21:14.291 --> 00:21:19.750
This is about government…
tearing our community apart.

407
00:21:19.833 --> 00:21:20.666
[audience cheering]

408
00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:24.750
It's about big government
taking away our freedom of choice.

409
00:21:24.833 --> 00:21:26.208
[Principal Hawkins] Okay. Okay.

410
00:21:26.291 --> 00:21:29.083
This is not about government intervention.

411
00:21:29.166 --> 00:21:31.000
Emma. what is this about?

412
00:21:32.375 --> 00:21:34.583
I just want to go to prom
like any other kid.

413
00:21:34.666 --> 00:21:37.041
[Principal Hawkins]
Mmm-hmm. But you can't.

414
00:21:37.125 --> 00:21:40.083
She can't. and that's why
the courts are involved.

415
00:21:40.166 --> 00:21:41.375
Ask yourself.

416
00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:46.125
What exactly is it that you find
so frightening about gay people?

Emma. my name is Barry. and I'm here
to tell you that you are not alone.

424
00:22:05.833 --> 00:22:09.250
Okay? I am as gay as a bucket of wigs.

and gay-positive icons. such as myself.

514

Uh-huh.

516
00:27:17.833 --> 00:27:21.833

You could say that I'm a big fan. Yes.

524

you won your first Tony.

-Okay.

537

Uh. Miss Allen. I just…
This is a very delicate situation.

538
00:28:27.041 --> 00:28:29.958
I'm asking you and your friends
to back off for a few days.

539

-Back off?
-Yeah.

540
00:28:32.916 --> 00:28:35.416
Backing off
is exactly what we're not going to do.

I see what's happening here.
You're trying to disarm me with flattery.

00:36:47.083 --> 00:36:49.833
[Barry] You made me fail.
I am so sick of failing.

681
00:36:49.916 --> 00:36:51.250
What do we do now?

682
00:36:51.333 --> 00:36:52.375
We leave.

683
00:36:52.958 --> 00:36:56.291
-First we kill Trent. then we leave.
-What about the girl?

684
00:36:56.375 --> 00:36:58.583
-[Dee Dee sighs]
-[Principal Hawkins] Hello. everyone…

685
00:36:59.791 --> 00:37:03.458
We have some news. Emma and I
wanted to be the ones to tell you.

686
00:37:03.541 --> 00:37:07.750
thanks to pressure from the state's
attorney's office. prom is back on!

687
00:37:07.833 --> 00:37:09.708
-[Barry] What?
-Prom is back on! [squeals]

688
00:37:09.791 --> 00:37:11.666
-[all cheering]
-We did it!

689
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:12.625
Yay!

690
00:37:12.708 --> 00:37:16.041
See? We're not narcissists.

691
00:37:16.125 --> 00:37:18.416
Just to be clear. uh.
it's not because of you…

692
00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:19.708
Well. maybe it was.

693
00:37:19.791 --> 00:37:23.000
I mean. everybody started freaking out
when you got here.

694
00:37:23.083 --> 00:37:26.791
The lawyer might've had legal power.
but you really scared people.

695
00:37:26.875 --> 00:37:28.208
-[Angie] Aw!
-We scared people!

696
00:37:28.291 --> 00:37:29.958
Important thing is. it's a victory.

697
00:37:30.041 --> 00:37:31.916
Now you get to go to prom
like everybody else!

698
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.125
-[Angie] Yes!
-What are you gonna wear?

699
00:37:34.208 --> 00:37:38.041
I was thinking like a vintage tux
and some high tops.

700
00:37:38.125 --> 00:37:40.083
I don't know. Does it matter?

701
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:42.750
-Does it…
-[scoffs]

702
00:37:43.541 --> 00:37:44.875
[snickers]

703
00:37:45.875 --> 00:37:49.166
-Honey…
-Sweetheart. boo-boo.

704
00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:51.625
I don't know you. okay?
And you don't know me.

705
00:37:51.708 --> 00:37:56.083
but I am begging you.
let me dress you for the prom.

706
00:37:56.166 --> 00:37:57.750
-Okay? Yeah?
-Okay.

707
00:37:57.833 --> 00:37:59.625
We're going to Saks.

708
00:37:59.708 --> 00:38:02.166
-Uh. there's no Saks here.
-We have a Kmart!

709
00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:03.958
-A what?
-A Kmart.

710
00:38:06.208 --> 00:38:08.208
-[laughs]
-[Barry] Fine.

711
00:38:09.166 --> 00:38:11.791
We'll check out
the Reba McEntire collection at Kmart.

712
00:38:11.875 --> 00:38:12.916
do a little fashion show.

713
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.625
Okay! Oh. can we do it tomorrow?
We can meet at my place.

714
00:38:16.708 --> 00:38:18.875
I have to go and find out
if I still have a date.

715
00:38:18.958 --> 00:38:20.875
Sure. I'll go ahead. do a pre-shop.

716
00:38:20.958 --> 00:38:23.458
Okay? Will you give me a ride
in your pickup truck?

717
00:38:23.541 --> 00:38:26.166
Are you saying that because I'm a lesbian.
I drive a pickup?

718
00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:28.708
-Well. do you? [chuckles]
-Shut up.

719
00:38:28.791 --> 00:38:30.791
-[Sheldon] Anybody hungry?
-[Angie] I could drink.

720
00:38:30.875 --> 00:38:33.916
-[Sheldon] What's around here?
-I saw a Big Boy by the highway.

721
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.208
-[Sheldon] Ooh. they have a gay bar here?
-[Angie] I love Big Boy.

722
00:38:37.291 --> 00:38:40.625
Oh. gay bar. Can't go. I'd be mobbed.

723
00:38:40.708 --> 00:38:42.208
-Oh! Of course.
-[both chuckle]

724
00:38:46.541 --> 00:38:49.166
-So. it's nice to see Emma smile again.
-Yes.

725
00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:50.875
She's had a rough go of it.

726
00:38:50.958 --> 00:38:53.416
I gathered that. Yeah.

727
00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:56.166
-Even before the prom controversy.
-Oh?

728
00:38:56.250 --> 00:39:00.375
When she came out. her parents.
well. they threw her out of the house.

729
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:04.916
-Really?
-Yeah. Yeah. She was 16.

730
00:39:05.541 --> 00:39:07.458
-It was. uh. pretty ugly.
-Oh…

731
00:39:10.333 --> 00:39:12.000
Anyway. um…

732
00:39:12.916 --> 00:39:14.458

733
00:39:15.625 --> 00:39:18.166

[Dee Dee] Yeah…

735
00:39:23.833 --> 00:39:25.791
-Uh. Tom?
-Yes. yeah?

736
00:39:26.583 --> 00:39:31.000
Is there a restaurant in town
that has plates and cutlery and…

737
00:39:31.083 --> 00:39:33.833
Oh. uh. there's an Applebee's by the mall.

738

[gasps]

739
00:39:37.583 --> 00:39:39.000
-Would you like to go?
-Yes.

740
00:39:39.083 --> 00:39:42.666
Take me now to this Apples & Bees place.

741

-Hello. Dee Dee Allen.
-We're aware.

804
00:42:57.833 --> 00:43:03.083
Ms. Allen. I'm sure that you are
very well-versed in the ways of the world

805
00:43:03.166 --> 00:43:06.125
and Broadway in particular.
That's a community.

806
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000
But you don't know us.
You don't know this town and our values.

807
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.625
No. well. I'm just here
advocating on behalf of a young girl

808
00:43:15.708 --> 00:43:20.333
whose voice perhaps is not heard
by some in the community.

809
00:43:20.916 --> 00:43:26.458
Yes. Well. perhaps you should stick
to acting instead of activism.

810
00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:29.708

-Yeah.

820

I don't know.
I'm just a small-town principal.

Oh. well. I'm surprised you're surprised.

829
00:44:21.083 --> 00:44:23.625
[chuckles] The two things
I'm most passionate about in the world

830
00:44:23.708 --> 00:44:26.291
are Broadway musicals
and secondary school administration.

831

Oh.

832
00:44:27.375 --> 00:44:31.958

Well. I'm divorced.

852
00:45:30.416 --> 00:45:33.208
Oh. I think I read about that.
Eddie Sharpe. the talk show host?

853
00:45:33.291 --> 00:45:34.958
Yeah. right.

854
00:45:35.041 --> 00:45:39.125
It lasted 15 heart-pulverizing years.

855
00:45:42.291 --> 00:45:46.375
I imagine it must be hard being
Dee Dee Allen. being a Broadway star.

You know. it is hard.

I just want to quit.

858
00:45:53.083 --> 00:45:56.666
No. No. please. you can't--
You can't do that.

Well…

906
00:49:00.875 --> 00:49:04.250
you know. she needed proof
she was still part of the family.

907

You're the cool grandmother I never had.

Hey. let me ask you something.
What happened with Emma?

912
00:49:24.166 --> 00:49:25.250
[sighs]

913
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:27.833
You're not a mother.
so you can't know what it's like

914
00:49:27.916 --> 00:49:30.375
to see your own daughter
give up her child.

915
00:49:30.458 --> 00:49:31.791
I'm sorry.

916
00:49:31.875 --> 00:49:36.000
When Emma came out.
oh. they could not handle it.

917
00:49:39.041 --> 00:49:41.625
To bad parents and their broken progeny.

918
00:49:42.875 --> 00:49:45.708
Although Emma is fine. She's a strong kid.

919
00:49:45.791 --> 00:49:46.625
[Barry] Mmm.

920
00:49:47.208 --> 00:49:48.958
Oh. I wasn't talking about her.

921
00:49:50.625 --> 00:49:52.875
What? You got kicked out too?

922
00:49:53.708 --> 00:49:56.125
Well. I left before they could do that.

923
00:49:59.166 --> 00:50:02.708
[Emma] So the only
nice dress I have is this.

924
00:50:02.791 --> 00:50:03.666
Wow.

925
00:50:04.666 --> 00:50:08.375
Okay. I mean. yeah. yep.
you could wear that to prom

926
00:50:08.458 --> 00:50:09.583
or keep it lying around

927
00:50:09.666 --> 00:50:12.083
in case there's a remake of
Little House on the Prairie.

928
00:50:12.166 --> 00:50:14.875
Okay. That's it. I like him.

929
00:50:14.958 --> 00:50:17.458
Emma. please let me
dress you for this prom.

930
00:50:17.541 --> 00:50:22.500
I don't know. This is all so crazy.
What did you wear to your prom?

931
00:50:22.583 --> 00:50:25.916
Well. I was going to wear a silver tux.

932
00:50:26.541 --> 00:50:29.333
aqua accessories. the whole look.

933
00:50:29.416 --> 00:50:32.500
I waited outside. anxious to see my crush.

934
00:50:32.583 --> 00:50:35.333
but when I saw him with his date. I froze.

935
00:50:36.083 --> 00:50:37.416
I couldn't go in.

936
00:50:38.291 --> 00:50:40.291
I didn't have your courage.

937
00:50:41.291 --> 00:50:42.666
This isn't about me.

938
00:50:43.708 --> 00:50:45.041
This is about you.

939
00:50:45.125 --> 00:50:48.625
And I promise you are going
to have the night of your life.

940
00:50:49.166 --> 00:50:50.500
What is your date wearing?

941
00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:52.750
I don't know.

942
00:50:54.333 --> 00:50:56.583
I've never been to her house before.

943
00:50:57.291 --> 00:50:58.916
Her mom doesn't know about us.

944
00:50:59.625 --> 00:51:01.083
How long have you been together?

945
00:51:01.916 --> 00:51:03.541
-A year and a half.
-Oh. honey.

946
00:51:03.625 --> 00:51:07.250
But she's coming out tonight. big time.
That's the plan.

947
00:51:09.208 --> 00:51:10.583
I'm really scared.

948
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:13.166
Would you get over here?

949
00:51:13.916 --> 00:51:17.708
The point is you are brave.

950
00:51:17.791 --> 00:51:19.875
You made all this happen.

951
00:51:19.958 --> 00:51:23.041
When you walk into that gym tonight.
you know what people are gonna see?

952
00:51:23.125 --> 00:51:25.875
They're going to see
the bravest person on the planet.

953
00:51:25.958 --> 00:51:29.625
This is so hard.
Does every girl go through this?

954
00:51:29.708 --> 00:51:31.625
Yes. all across town.

955
00:51:31.708 --> 00:51:35.125
girls are spraying on their tans
and whitening their teeth.

956
00:51:35.208 --> 00:51:38.791
trying to look their best for the prom.
but they're wasting their time

957
00:51:38.875 --> 00:51:42.500
because they don't have the glow
that you have right now.

958

I trust you completely.
and that's kind of scary too.

-Yes. mall the hell out of it!

01:05:09.166 --> 01:05:13.666
I think the best thing we can do
is disinfect our things and go back home.

1187
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:15.500
-No. we are not leaving.
-No!

1188
01:05:15.583 --> 01:05:19.958
Dee Dee. we are gonna stay here.
and we're going to turn this thing around.

1189
01:05:20.041 --> 01:05:22.250
-We gotta take back the press.
-[Trent] Yes. how?

1190
01:05:22.333 --> 01:05:26.000
Emma. you've got to step up
and be the face of this thing.

1191
01:05:26.083 --> 01:05:27.750
And that's going to get her a prom?

1192
01:05:27.833 --> 01:05:31.541
This is not about a prom anymore.
This is about right and wrong.

1193
01:05:31.625 --> 01:05:34.375
We need a national audience. prime time.

1194
01:05:34.458 --> 01:05:37.500
You want a big audience fast?
We gotta use our ace in the hole.

1195
01:05:38.875 --> 01:05:41.125
-One call to Eddie Sharpe is all we need.
-No. No.

1196
01:05:41.208 --> 01:05:42.416
-[Trent] Dee Dee!
-He's right.

1197
01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:45.541
If I ask him for something.
he will want something in return.

1198
01:05:45.625 --> 01:05:47.375
and what he will want
is the Hamptons house.

1199
01:05:47.458 --> 01:05:48.958
He's been trying to get it for years.

1200
01:05:49.833 --> 01:05:53.541
Okay. Okay. fine. Look. Sheldon.
you got to get that girl on TV.

1201
01:05:53.625 --> 01:05:55.000
-Okay.
-Great.

1202
01:05:55.083 --> 01:05:57.000
No. not great.

1203
01:05:57.083 --> 01:06:00.333
I'm sorry. but there is no way
I'm getting in front of a camera

1204
01:06:00.416 --> 01:06:03.375
and telling my story
to millions of people. I can't do that.

1205
01:06:03.458 --> 01:06:07.500
-See?
-Please. Please. just go.

1206
01:06:08.458 --> 01:06:11.875
-Emma. if you do nothing-- Okay.
-Barry. Go.

1207
01:06:13.541 --> 01:06:17.166
-Okay. I get it. Okay. Okay.
-[Angie] Go. Go. go. go. Go. go.

1208
01:06:17.250 --> 01:06:19.291
[whispering] I got this.
I know what I'm doing.

1209
01:06:20.833 --> 01:06:22.041
Let me do my thing.

1210
01:06:24.041 --> 01:06:26.958
There must be a way to rid this community.
and by extension. the nation.

1211
01:06:27.041 --> 01:06:28.500
of this cancer of intolerance.

1212
01:06:28.583 --> 01:06:30.875
What are you even doing here?
What happened to Godspell?

1213
01:06:30.958 --> 01:06:34.333
Indianapolis was canceled.
as was the naval base at Guantánamo Bay.

1214
01:06:34.416 --> 01:06:36.208
What I'm thinking I'm going to do is this.

1215
01:06:36.291 --> 01:06:39.541
Venture forth and seek out
the young people and rap.

1216
01:06:39.625 --> 01:06:41.041
in a non-musical sense.

1217
01:06:49.583 --> 01:06:50.416
[Angie] Mmm.

1218
01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:56.750
Let's go get some more. huh?

1219
01:06:57.583 --> 01:06:58.833
Two spoons this time.

1220
01:06:59.916 --> 01:07:00.916
Come on.

1221
01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:06.166
[Angie] Gotta stop. [chuckling]

1222
01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:11.791
Before you lecture me or kick me to death
with those crazy antelope legs of yours.

1223
01:07:11.875 --> 01:07:15.583
or whatever you're gonna do.
I know I should do something.

1224
01:07:16.958 --> 01:07:18.500
I just can't.

1225
01:07:18.583 --> 01:07:20.125
You gotta do this.

1226
01:07:20.208 --> 01:07:22.083
You gotta do it for all of us people

1227
01:07:22.166 --> 01:07:25.791
that are standing in the wings.
waiting to go on.

1228
01:07:27.083 --> 01:07:29.500
-I'm too scared.
-Hmm.

1229
01:07:31.666 --> 01:07:33.083
Let me tell you a story.

1230
01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:36.750
It's 1975

1231
01:07:36.833 --> 01:07:40.041
and the original company of Chicago
is in previews.

1232
01:07:40.125 --> 01:07:43.041
and the worst flu in history
hits the cast.

1233
01:07:43.125 --> 01:07:47.291
They're down to the third cover
for the role of Roxie Hart

1234
01:07:47.375 --> 01:07:50.291
and she's scared. just like you are.

1235
01:07:50.375 --> 01:07:56.666
And Fosse. who is a real ballbuster.
is putting her through her paces

1236
01:07:56.750 --> 01:07:58.458
and she's petrified.

1237
01:07:58.541 --> 01:08:01.166
Worst of all. she's doing the routine
like she's a robot.

1238
01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:07.625
So the Foss. he says.
"Hey. kid. Snap out of it."

1239
01:08:08.125 --> 01:08:09.583
[jazz music playing]

1240
01:08:09.666 --> 01:08:11.875
"You got the steps."

1241
01:08:11.958 --> 01:08:14.250
"You've got the notes."

1242
01:08:15.416 --> 01:08:18.833
"Where's the zazz. baby?"

1243
01:08:20.208 --> 01:08:23.666
And even though
she'd never heard that word before.

1244
01:08:23.750 --> 01:08:26.041
she knew immediately what it meant.

1245
01:08:26.125 --> 01:08:29.375
And she went out there
and she found that spotlight.

1246
01:08:29.458 --> 01:08:32.250
and she crushed that performance so hard.

1247
01:08:32.333 --> 01:08:39.125
she had that whole audience standing
on their feet screaming bloody murder!

1248
01:08:39.208 --> 01:08:40.041
[sighs]

1249
01:08:40.791 --> 01:08:42.250
And that girl was you!

1250
01:08:43.125 --> 01:08:44.125
What?

1251
01:08:44.875 --> 01:08:46.375
How old do you think I am?

1252
01:08:46.458 --> 01:08:50.666
It was 1975! No.

1253
01:08:50.750 --> 01:08:56.541
The point is
every Fosse girl knows that story.

1254
01:08:56.625 --> 01:09:00.625

You don't understand the concept of zazz.

The zazz comes from within.

01:12:12.125 --> 01:12:14.541

this could be our last time…

01:12:14.625 --> 01:12:15.958
We shouldn't be doing this.

-Sheldon is on it. Come on.

-How does this work. anyway?
-[Barry] It's infrared.

1311
01:12:29.541 --> 01:12:32.333
-It reduces inflammation.
-[Dee Dee] Oh. good.

-Yeah.
-[Barry] Mmm.

1320
01:12:57.666 --> 01:13:01.416
Then he… took me out for dinner after.

1321
01:13:02.041 --> 01:13:04.875
Well. I took him out. [chuckles]

1322
01:13:04.958 --> 01:13:06.250
He didn't have any money.

1323
01:13:06.333 --> 01:13:11.416
He was just starting out in comedy.
and he didn't have the big show like now.

1325
01:13:16.250 --> 01:13:18.750
And I picked up the tab. I paid.

01:13:20.666 --> 01:13:23.625
-[Barry] That was a bad move.
-[Dee Dee] No kidding. I'm still paying.

You know? I believed him.
I believed him every single time.

He didn't love me. [chuckles]

He didn't…

1342
01:14:12.666 --> 01:14:14.791

1343
01:14:16.666 --> 01:14:18.041
But he liked the money.

1344
01:14:18.833 --> 01:14:21.625
Oh. yeah. so I got out.

1345
01:14:23.375 --> 01:14:24.375
I got out…

1346
01:14:25.541 --> 01:14:27.416

01:14:36.791 --> 01:14:38.791
[announcer on TV] It's Eddie Sharpe!

1351
01:14:38.875 --> 01:14:40.125
[Eddie] Whoa. hey!

1352
01:14:40.208 --> 01:14:43.291
Welcome. everybody!
What's today's words of wisdom?

1353
01:14:43.375 --> 01:14:45.875
[Eddie and audience] Never sign a prenup!

1354
01:14:45.958 --> 01:14:47.666
[all laughing through TV]

1355
01:14:50.708 --> 01:14:53.291
And you know what the worst part is?

1356
01:14:55.083 --> 01:14:56.000
I shut down.

1357
01:14:58.208 --> 01:15:03.250
He took my little.
delicate blueberry heart.

1358
01:15:03.333 --> 01:15:05.916
and he just… squished it.

1359
01:15:07.666 --> 01:15:08.500
[Dee Dee sniffles]

1360
01:15:10.541 --> 01:15:13.375
-What?
-Here's what you're gonna do. okay?

1361
01:15:14.125 --> 01:15:18.041
You're gonna wear something
heart-stopping. like that yellow cape

1362
01:15:18.125 --> 01:15:19.750
and those cute little boots.

1363
01:15:19.833 --> 01:15:21.583
And you are gonna march down

1364
01:15:21.666 --> 01:15:25.583
to that principal's office
like a bad. bad girl.

1365
01:15:25.666 --> 01:15:27.333
[chuckling] Tom?

1366
01:15:27.416 --> 01:15:29.791
-Tom is a fan. Friend.
-[Barry] Hmm?

1367
01:15:29.875 --> 01:15:31.041
Well…

1368
01:15:32.250 --> 01:15:33.375
he likes you.

1369
01:15:34.541 --> 01:15:36.250
As a fan. Friend.

1370
01:15:37.541 --> 01:15:40.083
I don't know.
Not even that much anymore.

1371
01:15:40.166 --> 01:15:42.583
Okay. let's cut the crap.
I would kill. kill.

1372
01:15:42.666 --> 01:15:45.416
to have a guy look at me
the way that he looks at you.

1373
01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:47.500
Stop it.

1374
01:15:48.416 --> 01:15:52.666
You're just…
You're poking my heart with your finger.

1375
01:15:53.375 --> 01:15:56.416
Your still-beating.
delicate little blueberry heart?

1376
01:16:02.250 --> 01:16:05.916
Do you think he really. really likes me?

1377
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.083
Oh. my God. yes!

1378
01:16:08.083 --> 01:16:09.416
Barry! [kisses]

1379
01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:11.125
[laughing]

1380
01:16:11.208 --> 01:16:14.166
-I love you! I love you!
-I love you! I love you!

1381
01:16:14.250 --> 01:16:16.541
You're just such a great… everything.

1382
01:16:16.625 --> 01:16:18.333
[laughing]

1383
01:16:19.125 --> 01:16:21.083
[Dee Dee] Okay. no. no. no. Okay.

1384
01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.083
This. the master stroke. your idea.

1385
01:16:24.166 --> 01:16:26.625
-And the boots?
-And the little cute boots.

1386
01:16:26.708 --> 01:16:27.666
[chuckling]

1387
01:16:28.666 --> 01:16:29.833
This is it.

1388
01:16:31.708 --> 01:16:32.708
Oh!

1389
01:16:33.541 --> 01:16:35.458
That is good.

1390
01:16:39.833 --> 01:16:41.875
Mmm. now…

1391
01:16:42.833 --> 01:16:43.666
you.

1392
01:16:46.458 --> 01:16:48.791
I've been thinking about you
since we got here.

1393
01:16:48.875 --> 01:16:51.791
Oh. God. I knew this was gonna
somehow turn around to me.

1394
01:16:51.875 --> 01:16:57.250
And I think it's time somebody poked
that gay little heart of yours.

1395
01:16:57.333 --> 01:16:59.250
Are we doing this? Fine. Uh…

1396
01:16:59.333 --> 01:17:02.666
Do I only go for 10s
when I know I'm a 6.2? Yes and--

1397
01:17:02.750 --> 01:17:06.083
Your parents. You're from Ohio. right?

1398
01:17:06.166 --> 01:17:07.416
So?

1399
01:17:08.291 --> 01:17:09.666
We're in Indiana.

1400
01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:13.500
-Ohio. Indiana. they're close.
-I can see where you're driving this.

1401
01:17:13.583 --> 01:17:15.958
You have two living parents

1402
01:17:16.041 --> 01:17:19.291
that you'll never be nearer to
than you are right now.

1403
01:17:19.375 --> 01:17:22.166
-I think you should call them.
-No.

1404
01:17:23.041 --> 01:17:24.416
They threw me away.

1405
01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:26.750
Well. did they really?

1406
01:17:26.833 --> 01:17:28.250
I told them that I was gay.

1407
01:17:28.333 --> 01:17:32.166
and they said that they would take me
to therapy to change myself completely.

1408
01:17:34.208 --> 01:17:37.875
Let your parents see who you are
before it's too late.

1409
01:17:40.625 --> 01:17:41.708
If you don't…

1410
01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:43.750
you'll regret it.

1411
01:17:45.875 --> 01:17:48.250
I'm not the one who should have regrets.

1412
01:17:50.291 --> 01:17:51.875
[voice breaking] I was the kid.

1413
01:17:52.958 --> 01:17:54.208
I was the kid!

1414
01:17:56.375 --> 01:17:57.958
[crying] I was 16.

1415
01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:03.458
Sixteen years old. I was terrified.

1416
01:18:03.541 --> 01:18:05.000
Terrified!

1417
01:18:08.125 --> 01:18:11.166
And I needed one thing from them
and they couldn't give it to me.

1418
01:18:11.250 --> 01:18:12.125
So don't you…

1419
01:18:13.708 --> 01:18:14.791
[sobbing]

1420
01:18:30.291 --> 01:18:31.875
[school bell ringing]

1421
01:18:33.666 --> 01:18:35.458
[woman over PA]
Would the following students

1422
01:18:35.541 --> 01:18:37.583
please report to after-school detention?

1423
01:18:38.458 --> 01:18:39.416
Harlan Doolittle…

1424
01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:40.333
Hi.

1425
01:18:40.416 --> 01:18:42.875
…Olivia Blanc. Frances Doolittle.
Thank you.

1426
01:18:43.958 --> 01:18:45.875
[Principal Hawkins]
Well. they each had a bite.

1427
01:18:45.958 --> 01:18:48.791
-Ooh. what'd you do?
-[Principal Hawkins] Yeah. a big bite.

1428
01:18:48.875 --> 01:18:50.875
I appreciate it. Bye-bye.

1429
01:18:52.375 --> 01:18:53.583
[Dee Dee chuckles softly]

1430
01:18:54.166 --> 01:18:56.083
Am I interrupting something?

1431
01:18:56.166 --> 01:18:58.041
I was just doing some research.

1432
01:18:58.125 --> 01:19:01.333
trying to figure out
if urinal cakes are poisonous.

1433
01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.125
-Uh. how can I help you?
-[chuckles softly]

1434
01:19:04.750 --> 01:19:09.750
Well. I've just been wandering
around town all day.

1435
01:19:09.833 --> 01:19:11.250
[chuckles]

1436
01:19:11.833 --> 01:19:15.125
I've seen the… sight. [chuckles softly]

1437
01:19:15.708 --> 01:19:16.708
And. um…

1438
01:19:18.458 --> 01:19:23.125
Bottom line is I just thought
you might want to take me to dinner

1439
01:19:23.208 --> 01:19:26.041
and worship me again. [chuckles]

1440
01:19:26.125 --> 01:19:27.750
No. I would not like to do that.

1441
01:19:27.833 --> 01:19:30.291
Now if you'll excuse me.
I've got work to do.

1442
01:19:30.375 --> 01:19:33.625
Okay. what's going on here?
Why is everybody always so mad at me?

1443
01:19:33.708 --> 01:19:37.583
Well. speaking for myself.
it's because you're an opportunist.

1444
01:19:37.666 --> 01:19:40.583
You came here for publicity.
You're a terrible person.

1445
01:19:40.666 --> 01:19:43.041
No. no. Nobody gets to
talk to me that way. Nobody!

1446
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000
You know. meeting you in person
has been colossally disappointing.

1447
01:19:47.083 --> 01:19:48.208
[scoffs]

1448
01:19:48.291 --> 01:19:50.083
I wanted you to be Dolores.

1449
01:19:50.166 --> 01:19:51.833
Who the hell is Dolores?

1450
01:19:51.916 --> 01:19:53.708
From Swallow the Moon.

1451
01:19:53.791 --> 01:19:54.750
[audience applauding]

1452
01:19:54.833 --> 01:19:58.541
[Principal Hawkins] She was joyful.
She was full of courage and hope.

1453
01:19:58.625 --> 01:20:01.625
-Okay. but she was fictional.
-But you made her real.

1454
01:20:03.250 --> 01:20:05.833
When you sang
"The Lady's Improving" to Troy Gibson.

1455
01:20:05.916 --> 01:20:09.125
you were admitting you weren't perfect
and you knew you could be better.

1456
01:20:09.208 --> 01:20:11.875
and that's why
he didn't fire you from the circus act.

1457
01:20:13.333 --> 01:20:15.791
Such humility and dignity.

1458
01:20:16.458 --> 01:20:18.916
-That's who I thought you were.
-Well. I'm not.

1459
01:20:19.916 --> 01:20:21.541
I'm not Dolores.

1460
01:20:23.166 --> 01:20:28.041
I'm just a really. really.
really good actress. And you…

1461
01:20:28.666 --> 01:20:30.916
You're just some hick town
high school teacher

1462
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.541
who can't even tell the difference
between fantasy and reality.

1463
01:20:34.625 --> 01:20:36.500

I'm not a total lost cause.
That was a totally selfless act.

1506
01:23:31.208 --> 01:23:34.166
I mean. people would pay
premium prices for that performance.

1507

[sighs] All right. you guys are dismissed.

1508
01:23:36.833 --> 01:23:40.958
Dee Dee. not charging for an apology
is not a selfless act.

1509
01:23:42.083 --> 01:23:43.083
What the hell?

1510
01:23:43.166 --> 01:23:47.125
If you want people to like you
instead of hate you. you have to be good.

1511
01:23:47.208 --> 01:23:51.291
A good person. You have to put
other people's interests before your own.

1512
01:23:52.208 --> 01:23:55.375
[scoffs] You don't understand.
I am a celebrity.

1513
01:23:55.458 --> 01:23:58.958
It is all about me.
It has been for decades. [chuckling]

1514
01:23:59.833 --> 01:24:03.833
That's the point of celebrity.
So I have to be reprogrammed.

1515
01:24:03.916 --> 01:24:07.583
I have to unlearn things
like shoving and taking.

What I did…

1690
01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:40.375
was I put her interest ahead of my own.

1850
01:44:47.833 --> 01:44:49.166
Well. I just… [exhales]

1851
01:44:49.250 --> 01:44:54.333
But. anyway. you can have what I have
in my Venmo and there's my cash.

1852
01:44:54.416 --> 01:44:55.458
It's all yours.

1853
01:44:55.541 --> 01:44:57.583
-Thanks. Angie. [chuckles]
-Sure.

1854
01:44:57.666 --> 01:45:00.958
Okay. This is my card
from the Actors Federal Credit Union.

1855
01:45:01.041 --> 01:45:03.458
Just cross your fingers and swipe.

1856
01:45:04.375 --> 01:45:08.416
All right. Well. we're making
some progress here. This is a nice start.

1857
01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:09.458
Um…

1858
01:45:09.541 --> 01:45:12.000
-We still have a long way to go.
-[Angie] Mmm-hmm.

1859
01:45:15.125 --> 01:45:16.291
[Angie clears throat]

1860
01:45:16.375 --> 01:45:19.416
-Dee Dee. Dee Dee?
-What?

1861
01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:23.291
Oh. come on. I know you've got
an American Express black card in there.

1862
01:45:23.375 --> 01:45:24.875
There's no limit on that baby.

1863
01:45:24.958 --> 01:45:30.000
Please. please. no.
I already gave a house.

1864
01:45:30.083 --> 01:45:32.833
Exactly. so this is nothing. Come on.

1865
01:45:34.791 --> 01:45:36.166
[seductively] Eleanor.

1866
01:45:37.875 --> 01:45:39.083
Franklin.

1867
01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:41.333
[sighs]

1868
01:45:42.666 --> 01:45:49.625
[dramatically] Why does being good
cost so much… money?

1869
01:45:49.708 --> 01:45:51.000
[all chuckling]

1870
01:45:51.083 --> 01:45:53.000
-Well done. Dee Dee.
-[chuckles]

1871
01:45:53.083 --> 01:45:54.916
-[Trent] Yes!
-We're fully financed.

1872
01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.875
-[Trent] Yeah!
-Okay. well. let's give this girl a prom!

1873
01:45:57.958 --> 01:45:59.875
-Yes!
-[Barry] Okay. let's do it!

1874
01:45:59.958 --> 01:46:03.083
[Trent] The students will want to see us
perform some sort of number.

1875
01:46:03.166 --> 01:46:06.541
So. look. I…
I've been thinking hard about this.

1876
01:46:06.625 --> 01:46:07.458
[Barry] Mmm.

1877
01:46:07.541 --> 01:46:10.250
That thing
that you and I were talking about.

1878
01:46:11.166 --> 01:46:13.750
-I called your mother.
-What?

1879
01:46:13.833 --> 01:46:16.875
Yeah. I found her number in your phone.

1880
01:46:17.875 --> 01:46:19.750
How did you know my passcode?

1881
01:46:19.833 --> 01:46:23.500
Well. I guessed. 9481. Beyoncé's birthday.

1882
01:46:23.583 --> 01:46:26.041
[chuckling] Got it on the first try.

1883
01:46:26.791 --> 01:46:30.041
-Well. why would you do that?
-Because. Barry…

1884
01:46:31.875 --> 01:46:35.625
-I know you couldn't do it on your own.
-What did she say?

1885
01:46:35.708 --> 01:46:38.625
Well. I think
maybe you should let her tell you that.

1886
01:46:39.583 --> 01:46:40.583
[Vera] Hi. Barry.

1887
01:46:42.291 --> 01:46:46.208
Okay. I'm gonna give you some space.
and I'll be in the faculty lounge. okay?

1888
01:46:49.833 --> 01:46:53.583
No. No. you…
You don't get to do this. Okay?

1889
01:46:53.666 --> 01:46:57.875
You don't get to show up
out of nowhere. Okay? No. Uh-uh.

1890
01:46:57.958 --> 01:46:59.500
I came all this way. Barry.

1891
01:46:59.583 --> 01:47:02.083
Well. you can just turn around
and go right back. okay?

1892
01:47:02.166 --> 01:47:03.791
You called me. didn't you?

1893
01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.666
That was you who called
and hung up. wasn't it?

1894
01:47:11.125 --> 01:47:11.958
[sighs]

1895
01:47:12.708 --> 01:47:17.541
I handled this all wrong. honey.
And I'm so sorry.

1896
01:47:17.625 --> 01:47:19.666
Okay. You just… stay…

1897
01:47:22.208 --> 01:47:26.500
When you told us what you were.
who you were.

1898
01:47:27.916 --> 01:47:31.000
your father and I. we were scared.

1899
01:47:31.083 --> 01:47:32.583
We hardly knew what gay meant.

1900
01:47:32.666 --> 01:47:35.666
We both thought
that somehow we had failed you.

1901
01:47:35.750 --> 01:47:37.458
like maybe it was our fault.

1902
01:47:38.875 --> 01:47:41.166
-So it's okay now?
-[sighs]

1903
01:47:41.250 --> 01:47:44.041
What I needed was a mother
who didn't know if it was okay

1904
01:47:44.125 --> 01:47:45.666
but loved me anyway.

1905
01:47:47.250 --> 01:47:49.958
You think you were scared?
How do you think I felt?

1906
01:47:50.041 --> 01:47:53.083
[sobbing] I know. Barry.
I failed you and I know.

1907
01:47:54.166 --> 01:47:57.083
That's gonna be on my heart
till the day I die.

1908
01:47:57.750 --> 01:48:02.958
[voice breaking] But all I can say is
I was wrong and I'm sorry.

1909
01:48:07.750 --> 01:48:09.666
What about Dad? Is he here?

1910
01:48:09.750 --> 01:48:11.833
Uh. no. He's just not…

1911
01:48:13.375 --> 01:48:14.541
He's not there yet.

1912
01:48:15.125 --> 01:48:16.541
I'm sorry to say.

1913
01:48:17.458 --> 01:48:18.458
Oh. Barry.

1914
01:48:20.416 --> 01:48:25.250
Please forgive me.
I've missed you so much.

1915
01:48:29.916 --> 01:48:31.250
[crying] I missed you too.

1916
01:48:32.541 --> 01:48:33.583
I did.

1917
01:48:34.791 --> 01:48:37.125
I missed you too. I missed you.

1918
01:48:37.208 --> 01:48:39.125
[both sobbing]

1919
01:48:42.416 --> 01:48:46.125
♪ Then you came along
And right or wrong… ♪

1920
01:48:46.208 --> 01:48:50.166
-Aren't you tired of watching that?
-Eight million people have seen it.

1921
01:48:50.791 --> 01:48:52.583
I just don't understand it.

1922
01:48:52.666 --> 01:48:54.416
Well. I think it's brave.

1923
01:48:55.208 --> 01:48:56.041
[sighs]

1924
01:48:56.625 --> 01:48:58.833
The kids are saying
there's gonna be another prom.

1925
01:48:58.916 --> 01:49:01.000
-[scoffs]
-Someone's offered to pay for it.

1926
01:49:02.833 --> 01:49:03.750
Who?

1927
01:49:04.958 --> 01:49:07.208
This is so generous of you guys.

1928
01:49:07.291 --> 01:49:09.958
We had to do something
after you broke the Internet.

1929
01:49:10.041 --> 01:49:13.000
It was crazy.
The numbers just kept going up.

1930
01:49:13.083 --> 01:49:16.333
and then the Indiana Star called.
and then the Washington Post--

1931
01:49:16.416 --> 01:49:17.833
Hello. everyone.

1932
01:49:17.916 --> 01:49:20.041
Can't have a prom without flowers.

1933
01:49:20.125 --> 01:49:22.083
So I will put these out on the table.

1934
01:49:22.166 --> 01:49:24.166
even though I'd rather just
give them all to you.

1935
01:49:24.250 --> 01:49:26.458
-[Angie] Oh. my God!
-[Barry] Is this for real?

1936
01:49:26.541 --> 01:49:31.750
Can I just say you guys are
the best middle-aged people I've ever met.

1937
01:49:32.500 --> 01:49:33.333
[exhales]

1938
01:49:34.291 --> 01:49:35.166
That is…

1939
01:49:35.250 --> 01:49:36.916
Oh. honey…

1940
01:49:38.041 --> 01:49:41.250
We need to talk to you
about something. okay? And I think it's…

1941
01:49:42.416 --> 01:49:44.541
It's important that you understand

1942
01:49:44.625 --> 01:49:47.916
the real reason
why we came here to visit you.

1943
01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.250
-It wasn't for the Hoosier pie?
-[chuckles]

1944
01:49:50.333 --> 01:49:52.208
Well. I mean. um…

1945
01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.541
-We were in a show.
-A wonderful show.

1946
01:49:57.625 --> 01:49:58.875
Well. I mean…

1947
01:49:59.750 --> 01:50:02.541
[hesitating]
And we got blasted by the critics.

1948
01:50:02.625 --> 01:50:05.916
They called us narcissists. and it hurt.

1949
01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.916
And it hurt
because I guess they were right.

1950
01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:14.250
So we looked around for a cause
that might give us some credibility.

1951
01:50:14.333 --> 01:50:16.625
[chuckling] Maybe get us some good press.

1952
01:50:16.708 --> 01:50:19.458
Like building
a house for Habitat for Humanity.

1953
01:50:19.541 --> 01:50:22.208
Then we realized that
we're not capable of building anything.

1954
01:50:22.291 --> 01:50:23.958
And then I found you on Twitter.

1955
01:50:24.041 --> 01:50:27.666
I mean. it was just dumb luck.
but meant to be.

1956
01:50:28.791 --> 01:50:32.583
Well. I'm sorry to tell you this. but…

1957
01:50:33.333 --> 01:50:35.541
you're going to build something.

1958

-You're going to build a prom.

Stop it! Stop this. please!

1960
01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:43.041
Who gave you people
permission to be in here?

1961
01:50:43.125 --> 01:50:46.208
-I did.
-You should have consulted with the PTA.

1962
01:50:46.291 --> 01:50:49.958
Well. this is not a school event. so
I'm not obliged to get the PTA's approval.

1963
01:50:50.541 --> 01:50:54.375
I'm going to be
as clear as I possibly can.

1964
01:50:55.416 --> 01:50:58.208
Your beliefs are not our beliefs.

1965
01:50:58.291 --> 01:51:00.166
Hey. Emma. Can we talk to you?

1966
01:51:06.125 --> 01:51:09.083
I was a jerk. and I'm sorry.

1967
01:51:09.875 --> 01:51:13.416
You deserve to go to prom
just like any other kid.

1968
01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:17.500
What? I thought you hated me.
I thought you all hated me.

1969
01:51:17.583 --> 01:51:18.916
Oh. they hated you.

1970
01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:23.208
They hated you with a burning passion
stoked by centuries of intolerance

1971
01:51:23.291 --> 01:51:25.291
and the lack of a drama program.

1972
01:51:25.375 --> 01:51:26.791
I'm sorry. too. Emma.

1973
01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:32.583
You know. you explain things really well.
You should be. like. a teacher.

-Oh. you should be our drama teacher!
-[girl] Yes. please!

-You're hired!
-I'm a teacher!

-As a temp.
-Absolutely.

1978
01:51:42.666 --> 01:51:45.125
No. no. no! This is--
This is what I was afraid of.

-Mom!
-Let me finish!

1980
01:51:46.958 --> 01:51:50.416
No. you have got to stop talking
and just listen. okay?

1981
01:51:52.500 --> 01:51:54.166
People don't turn gay.

1982
01:51:55.250 --> 01:51:56.291
They are who they are.

1983
01:51:56.375 --> 01:51:58.541
No. You don't know what you're saying.

1984
01:51:58.625 --> 01:51:59.625
I do.

1985
01:52:00.416 --> 01:52:01.333
I do.

1986
01:52:03.541 --> 01:52:07.583
Look. I know how you were raised.
but… the world's a different place.

1987
01:52:08.291 --> 01:52:10.083
And sure. it's not great. but…

1988
01:52:11.083 --> 01:52:16.250
it's… it's better because of people
who have the courage to be who they are.

1989
01:52:19.125 --> 01:52:20.291
People like her.

You are very young and you are confused.
