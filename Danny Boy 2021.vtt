: Heavy incoming!
- : Whisky 2-2

8
00:00:29.657 --> 00:00:31.096
five minutes away.

9
00:00:36.895 --> 00:00:38.301
:
This is Whisky 2-2

10
00:00:38.336 --> 00:00:39.566
approaching
Checkpoint Danny Boy.

11
00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:41.337
RPG and gunshot incoming.

12
00:00:41.372 --> 00:00:43.735
I don't like it.
- Just sit tight. mate. OK?

13
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.143
You're gonna be alright.

14
00:00:47.741 --> 00:00:50.445
: Woody. listen up.
Enemy are dug in.

15
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.348
Your orders
are to leave the vehicle.

16
00:00:52.383 --> 00:00:55.252
Sorry. say again. Stick. You
want us to dismount into that?

17
00:00:55.287 --> 00:00:57.089
They've got two men down.
They need help.

18
00:00:57.124 --> 00:00:58.387
So prep the boys for dismount.

19
00:01:00.127 --> 00:01:01.192
What's he saying?

20
00:01:06.892 --> 00:01:09.266
We're gonna dismount
and close with the enemy.

21
00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:11.169
:
What. here? Just us?

22
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:14.832
After me.
Be quick about it. yeah?

23
00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:34.357
: How does it feel
to be accused of war crimes?

24
00:01:34.392 --> 00:01:35.193
It's Brian Wood.

25
00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:39.362
-

26
00:01:46.173 --> 00:01:48.437
: A boy at school
says you're a murderer.

27
00:01:48.472 --> 00:01:50.175
:
And that's what's upsetting you?

28
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.308
That is upsetting.

29
00:01:55.875 --> 00:01:57.545
Come here. little man.

30
00:02:00.385 --> 00:02:03.188
Say you're not.
- Not what?

31
00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:04.156
Dad.

32
00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:06.488
Bailey...

33
00:02:08.195 --> 00:02:09.590
do I look like a murderer
to you?

34
00:02:10.725 --> 00:02:14.529
The inquiry's terms of reference
are as follows. and I quote:

35
00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:17.532
"To investigate and report
on the allegations made

36
00:02:17.567 --> 00:02:20.172
by the claimants against
British soldiers

37
00:02:20.207 --> 00:02:24.275
on the 14th and 15th
of May 2004."

38
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.279
Corporal Wood. do you understand
how matters will proceed?

39
00:02:30.008 --> 00:02:32.382
I do. sir. yes.

40
00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:45.263
:
OK. lads. you're on your own.

41
00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:46.561
You ready for this?

42
00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.893
Rushy. you ready for this?
- Yes!

43
00:02:48.928 --> 00:02:50.928
Spud? Let's do this! Go. go. go!

44
00:03:07.881 --> 00:03:10.354
Ah. Jesus. babe.

45
00:03:13.623 --> 00:03:15.887
Do you ever get that thing.
you wake up

46
00:03:15.922 --> 00:03:17.724
and you haven't
got a bloody clue where you are?

47
00:03:18.826 --> 00:03:20.331
No.

48
00:03:26.603 --> 00:03:28.273
Want me to tell you
where you are?

49
00:03:28.935 --> 00:03:30.242
I know now.

50
00:03:31.773 --> 00:03:32.838
Want me to tell you?

51
00:03:34.941 --> 00:03:35.841
:
Yeah. go on. then.

52
00:03:37.713 --> 00:03:40.285
You are in London.
- Yeah?

53
00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:42.947
To meet the Queen.

54
00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:45.389
And why's that then?

55
00:03:45.424 --> 00:03:48.755
Because you're a hero and she
wants to pin something on you.

56
00:04:01.473 --> 00:04:03.440
: Come on. wee man.
come on. Let's go find your mum.

57
00:04:03.475 --> 00:04:05.310
- Here we go. come on.

58
00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:07.246
She's in there. Go and see her.
On you go. son.

59
00:04:07.776 --> 00:04:10.381
Ho-ho!
Look at this smart wee laddie.

60
00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:12.647
:
Wahey! Alright. Bailey boy?

61
00:04:12.682 --> 00:04:14.550
How did you like spending
the night with Nana and Grandad?

62
00:04:14.585 --> 00:04:16.750
Hello!
- He wants to see his mum.

63
00:04:16.785 --> 00:04:18.686
Did you forget your kecks?
- Is that a problem?

64
00:04:18.721 --> 00:04:21.689
He's got great legs.
Look at my lovely boy!

65
00:04:21.724 --> 00:04:24.054
He's our lovely boy.
- Are you our lovely boy?

66
00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:26.496
Are you our lovely boy?
- Are you two not ready yet?

67
00:04:26.531 --> 00:04:28.399
Do you know what time it is?
- : Er. tranquillo.

68
00:04:28.434 --> 00:04:29.763
Dad. be honest.
is this tie straight?

69
00:04:29.798 --> 00:04:31.468
It's straight.
Come on. get a move on.

70
00:04:31.503 --> 00:04:33.569
Don't muss him all up. you. Took
me forever getting him dressed.

71
00:04:33.604 --> 00:04:35.098
You might have
to do the same for Brian.

72
00:04:35.133 --> 00:04:36.935
Wouldn't be the first time.
Give that here

73
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.707
and get your trousers on.
- Right. that's it. Chop chop.

74
00:04:39.742 --> 00:04:42.314
I'm putting you two
on the clock. T-minus ten.

75
00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.495
:
23 years in the Army. son.

76
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.090
It never took me
to places like this.

77
00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:16.975
: On the 14th of May 2004.
Lance Corporal Brian Wood

78
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.746
was sent to the aid of comrades

79
00:05:18.781 --> 00:05:21.551
ambushed under enemy fire
at Checkpoint Danny Boy.

80
00:05:22.785 --> 00:05:24.081
In recognition
of his leadership

81
00:05:24.116 --> 00:05:25.687
courage and selfless action

82
00:05:25.722 --> 00:05:28.052
during some of
the fiercest fighting in Iraq

83
00:05:28.087 --> 00:05:31.330
Lance Corporal Wood receives the
Military Cross for gallantry.

84
00:05:35.127 --> 00:05:36.863
:
Come on. Brian. Keep up.

85
00:05:36.898 --> 00:05:39.734
: He does know other
stuff. but mainly he's keepers.

86
00:05:39.769 --> 00:05:41.736
: Don't tell me they
have a coach just for goalies.

87
00:05:41.771 --> 00:05:43.738
: Anyway. he asked me
to be the one taking penalties

88
00:05:43.773 --> 00:05:45.773
for the goalies to have
penalty-taking practice

89
00:05:45.808 --> 00:05:47.709
cos he said they can never
tell where I was gonna go

90
00:05:47.744 --> 00:05:49.711
and also I could put it
where I wanted it to go.

91
00:05:49.746 --> 00:05:51.713
Whereas a lot of the
other kids just froze up

92
00:05:51.748 --> 00:05:53.616
when it came to spot kicks.
or looked at the keepers

93
00:05:53.651 --> 00:05:55.387
and lost their concentration.
And he said--

94
00:05:55.422 --> 00:05:58.390
OK. OK. Brian.
- "Keep it brief."

95
00:05:58.425 --> 00:05:59.820
:
Keep it brief.

96
00:06:00.592 --> 00:06:02.592
So. you wanted
to come out running.

97
00:06:02.627 --> 00:06:05.023
Let's see what you're made of.
- Yeah?

98
00:06:05.058 --> 00:06:06.090
:
Yeah.

99
00:06:06.664 --> 00:06:07.828
Alright.
- Yeah!

100
00:06:07.863 --> 00:06:08.796
Alright!

101
00:06:19.446 --> 00:06:20.841
:
It begins with R. Brian!

102
00:06:25.012 --> 00:06:26.616
Resilience.

103
00:06:28.917 --> 00:06:30.081
Dad!

104
00:06:51.775 --> 00:06:53.775
: Alright. Woody?
Where's your medal?

105
00:07:21.574 --> 00:07:22.870
:
Sir. what's it like

106
00:07:22.905 --> 00:07:25.070
jumping out of a Warrior
under fire?

107
00:07:25.105 --> 00:07:26.874
That's a good question.

108
00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:29.239
It's. er. Johnno. right?
- Sir.

109
00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:33.144
Johnno.
I'm here today to tell you

110
00:07:33.179 --> 00:07:34.519
all about the realities of war.

111
00:07:37.524 --> 00:07:40.283
And maybe one of the realities
of war is it's not so easy

112
00:07:40.318 --> 00:07:41.724
to stand up and talk about it.

113
00:07:44.894 --> 00:07:46.256
And you're gonna
have guys out there

114
00:07:46.291 --> 00:07:48.258
who are making a big song
and dance about what they did

115
00:07:48.293 --> 00:07:49.666
getting their
names in the paper.

116
00:07:49.701 --> 00:07:50.997
Good luck to them.

117
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:52.933
I'll let you make your
own judgment about that.

118
00:07:52.968 --> 00:07:54.231
I've got nothing
to say about that.

119
00:07:56.708 --> 00:07:58.235
You know what I was focusing on?

120
00:08:00.173 --> 00:08:02.679
Eh? Anyone?

121
00:08:04.342 --> 00:08:06.617
I wasn't thinking
about being brave

122
00:08:06.652 --> 00:08:09.213
being a hero.
or winning medals.

123
00:08:09.622 --> 00:08:11.589
I was focusing
on destroying the enemy

124
00:08:11.624 --> 00:08:13.591
and keeping myself
and my men alive.

125
00:08:15.287 --> 00:08:17.023
I was fighting my own fight.

126
00:08:18.026 --> 00:08:20.290
I wasn't worried about
what everybody else was doing.

127
00:08:20.325 --> 00:08:22.666
Alright? That's a sure-fire
way to get yourself--

128
00:08:22.701 --> 00:08:24.668
- Corporal Wood?

129
00:08:26.199 --> 00:08:27.605
Yeah?

130
00:08:34.273 --> 00:08:36.713
Spencer.
HE CLEARS THROAT

131
00:08:47.286 --> 00:08:49.121
I'm teaching. What's this about?

132
00:08:49.893 --> 00:08:51.189
We just want
a little chat with you.

133
00:08:51.224 --> 00:08:52.630
A little chat?

134
00:08:53.391 --> 00:08:55.765
Congratulations
on the medal. Corporal.

135
00:08:55.965 --> 00:08:57.569
Are you gonna tell me
what this is about?

136
00:08:58.330 --> 00:08:59.802
We will. yeah.

137
00:09:10.309 --> 00:09:13.750
You just take a seat here
for me. please. Corporal Wood.

138
00:09:16.018 --> 00:09:18.084
We're gonna show you photos.
Corporal

139
00:09:18.119 --> 00:09:21.758
from the Battle of Danny Boy.
from its aftermath.

140
00:09:21.793 --> 00:09:23.826
You tell us if you
recognise anyone in them.

141
00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:26.565
OK?

142
00:09:42.044 --> 00:09:43.109
And this one?

143
00:09:46.686 --> 00:09:48.081
What's this about?

144
00:09:48.116 --> 00:09:51.018
Just whether you know
who these people are. Corporal.

145
00:09:51.053 --> 00:09:52.085
No.

146
00:10:01.767 --> 00:10:03.096
That's my unit.

147
00:10:05.331 --> 00:10:06.363
:
Him?

148
00:10:08.972 --> 00:10:10.873
Do you recognise this detainee.
Corporal Wood?

149
00:10:16.045 --> 00:10:17.143
Yeah. I. um...

150
00:10:18.344 --> 00:10:19.783
I took him prisoner.

151
00:10:19.818 --> 00:10:21.015
And what was
the manner of that?

152
00:10:23.481 --> 00:10:26.185
Do you recall the rules of
engagement. Corporal Wood?

153
00:10:29.421 --> 00:10:32.290
Yes.
- So you took this man prisoner.

154
00:10:35.229 --> 00:10:38.263
Tell me about the use of force.
- He gave himself up.

155
00:10:38.298 --> 00:10:39.737
He was armed?

156
00:10:40.839 --> 00:10:43.004
Was he just a man
in a field. or...?

157
00:10:43.039 --> 00:10:44.808
No. he was armed.

158
00:10:44.843 --> 00:10:46.711
The CSM shouted.
"Drop your weapons." and he did.

159
00:10:46.746 --> 00:10:47.877
The CSM just shouted--

160
00:10:47.912 --> 00:10:49.747
"Drop your fucking weapons."
yeah.

161
00:10:52.785 --> 00:10:54.345
You'd drop 'em. wouldn't you?

162
00:10:54.754 --> 00:10:56.413
You met the CSM.

163
00:10:56.855 --> 00:10:58.888
Was he barefoot
when you took him prisoner?

164
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:05.928
Yeah.
- Did you plasticuff him?

165
00:11:07.096 --> 00:11:09.899
No. no. not at the time. no.
- Did you offer him water?

166
00:11:13.267 --> 00:11:15.003
Not that I recall.

167
00:11:15.038 --> 00:11:16.807
I'd have thought that date
was printed on your memory.

168
00:11:20.879 --> 00:11:21.977
It is.

169
00:11:27.215 --> 00:11:29.050
So. did you offer him water...

170
00:11:31.054 --> 00:11:32.317
Corporal Wood?

171
00:11:36.026 --> 00:11:37.355
Did you?

172
00:11:39.766 --> 00:11:41.293
Did you offer him water?
- Corporal Wood--

173
00:11:41.328 --> 00:11:42.701
Or were you not there?

174
00:11:56.409 --> 00:11:59.377
Sorry. say again. Stick. You
want us to dismount into that?

175
00:11:59.412 --> 00:12:01.753
: They've got two
men down. They need help.

176
00:12:01.788 --> 00:12:02.820
Prep the boys for dismount.

177
00:12:05.825 --> 00:12:07.187
OK. lads. You're on your own.

178
00:12:07.222 --> 00:12:08.859
You ready for this?
-

179
00:12:08.894 --> 00:12:10.795
Rushy. you ready for this?
- Yes.

180
00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:13.094
Spud? Let's do this! Go. go. go!

181
00:12:33.545 --> 00:12:35.578
: Enemy. bridge line.
We close with the enemy

182
00:12:35.613 --> 00:12:37.283
we take position one. yeah?

183
00:12:37.318 --> 00:12:39.120
:
But that's 120 metres away!

184
00:12:41.421 --> 00:12:42.486
Right. he's firing us in!

185
00:12:42.521 --> 00:12:45.324
Five. four. three.

186
00:12:45.997 --> 00:12:47.227
two. one!

187
00:12:53.004 --> 00:12:53.970
On me!

188
00:12:57.844 --> 00:12:58.810
50 metres!

189
00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:05.080
:
Go. go. go!

190
00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:12.824
Get your hands up now!

191
00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.090
On the ground now!

192
00:13:15.125 --> 00:13:18.027
Get the fuck on the ground now!
You fucking... Shut the fuck up!

193
00:13:22.033 --> 00:13:23.232
:
Where'd the rest of them go?

194
00:13:23.268 --> 00:13:25.034
: They could be back
any minute. Get the cuffs on.

195
00:13:27.874 --> 00:13:30.468
Position one.
Not a scratch on us. boys.

196
00:13:30.503 --> 00:13:32.338
British fighting spirit
done that. mate.

197
00:13:32.373 --> 00:13:34.076
Here we go. lads. Get in.

198
00:13:51.491 --> 00:13:54.228
Wait there. wait there.
I'll be right down.

199
00:14:00.533 --> 00:14:01.873
Morning.

200
00:14:02.337 --> 00:14:04.271
Put this intercom
and security in

201
00:14:04.306 --> 00:14:05.976
because of all
the threats against us.

202
00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:07.571
It doesn't work properly

203
00:14:08.112 --> 00:14:11.047
so I spend all my time running
up and down these stairs.

204
00:14:11.544 --> 00:14:13.511
It won't be the nutjobs
that kill me.

205
00:14:13.546 --> 00:14:15.117
It'll be the exhaustion.

206
00:14:15.152 --> 00:14:17.185
Thanks for coming
up to the office to see me.

207
00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.550
It'll give you a chance to see
the job the way it really is.

208
00:14:20.091 --> 00:14:21.585
Of course. I'm too bloody busy

209
00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:23.895
to get up to the university
at the moment.

210
00:14:25.558 --> 00:14:28.262
Some of you will end up
in big fuck-off law practices

211
00:14:28.297 --> 00:14:31.265
in the City with smoked glass
and neck massages

212
00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.268
but the vast majority
of lawyers work like this.

213
00:14:34.303 --> 00:14:36.270
You'll need to get
your brains around that.

214
00:14:36.305 --> 00:14:38.371
Right. straight through.
in here. come on.

215
00:14:39.605 --> 00:14:42.573
My advice is go running

216
00:14:43.543 --> 00:14:46.951
do yoga. start flower-arranging.

217
00:14:47.382 --> 00:14:49.954
Anything to give you
a sense of perspective.

218
00:14:51.254 --> 00:14:52.418
This job will eat you up

219
00:14:52.453 --> 00:14:54.189
and spit you out
if you're not careful.

220
00:14:54.224 --> 00:14:55.553
Who wants tea?
- Me.

221
00:14:55.588 --> 00:14:57.588
Ah. What's your name?

222
00:14:57.623 --> 00:14:59.095
Deena.
- Sugar?

223
00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:00.558
Two. please.
- Ah.

224
00:15:01.495 --> 00:15:03.495
Oh. shit. There is none.

225
00:15:04.399 --> 00:15:09.369
Er. right. So. you want
to be human rights lawyers.

226
00:15:09.767 --> 00:15:12.537
What's the first quality
you're going to need? Hm?

227
00:15:14.145 --> 00:15:16.046
Got some sachets here somewhere.

228
00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:17.949
Come on. I won't bite.

229
00:15:17.984 --> 00:15:20.116
Compassion?
- Compassion? OK.

230
00:15:20.745 --> 00:15:22.085
Anything else?

231
00:15:23.385 --> 00:15:25.055
Empathy?
- A thick skin.

232
00:15:25.486 --> 00:15:27.552
You're going to need
a thick skin.

233
00:15:27.587 --> 00:15:29.257
And why do I say that. Deena?

234
00:15:29.292 --> 00:15:30.720
Because some of the things
we might be doing--

235
00:15:30.755 --> 00:15:33.228
Because people will tear you up.

236
00:15:33.263 --> 00:15:36.132
Politicians. the press.
the establishment.

237
00:15:36.629 --> 00:15:39.971
It doesn't matter
how clear it is to you

238
00:15:40.006 --> 00:15:41.698
that human rights are sacrosanct

239
00:15:41.733 --> 00:15:43.535
and you have a duty
to protect them

240
00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:45.042
whoever's they might be.

241
00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:48.309
Other people
will tell you different.

242
00:15:48.344 --> 00:15:50.212
They'll tell you
you're a bleeding heart

243
00:15:50.247 --> 00:15:51.378
they'll tell you you're naive

244
00:15:51.413 --> 00:15:53.116
they'll tell you
you're money-grubbing.

245
00:15:53.151 --> 00:15:55.118
Why do they say those things?

246
00:15:55.153 --> 00:15:56.746
Hm? Mush?
Why do they say those things?

247
00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:00.222
Who? The--
- Because now and then

248
00:16:00.257 --> 00:16:02.026
you're going
to have to tell them things

249
00:16:02.061 --> 00:16:04.061
they really don't want to hear.

250
00:16:05.328 --> 00:16:06.591
And here's one of them.

251
00:16:08.133 --> 00:16:10.595
British soldiers
get away with murder.

252
00:16:12.038 --> 00:16:13.237
Who's heard of Baha Mousa?

253
00:16:14.403 --> 00:16:18.306
Couple of years ago. Iraqi lad.
worked in a hotel in Basra.

254
00:16:18.539 --> 00:16:20.473
About the same age as you lot.
He's. uh...

255
00:16:21.839 --> 00:16:25.016
He's a father of two kids
aged two and four.

256
00:16:25.051 --> 00:16:27.315
He's dead. right?
- He is now. yes.

257
00:16:27.713 --> 00:16:29.317
Brace yourselves.

258
00:16:30.221 --> 00:16:34.058
That's him after a period
at Her Majesty's pleasure.

259
00:16:36.557 --> 00:16:40.823
So. on behalf of his family.
I respectfully argued in court

260
00:16:40.858 --> 00:16:44.233
that Baha Mousa.
in British custody in Iraq

261
00:16:44.268 --> 00:16:46.664
had the same human rights
as any other prisoner

262
00:16:46.699 --> 00:16:49.271
in any other British jail.

263
00:16:49.306 --> 00:16:52.637
Doesn't matter if it's
in Basra or in Birmingham.

264
00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:54.573
Anyone want to argue with that?

265
00:16:54.608 --> 00:16:56.377
The MOD.
- Ha!

266
00:16:56.412 --> 00:16:58.742
The Ministry of Defence.
very good. they did indeed

267
00:16:58.777 --> 00:17:02.119
because it made their
job much more difficult.

268
00:17:02.154 --> 00:17:05.782
But the High Court and the
Court of Appeal agreed with me.

269
00:17:05.817 --> 00:17:10.160
British law applies wherever
British soldiers have command.

270
00:17:10.195 --> 00:17:12.327
Anybody want to
argue with that principle?

271
00:17:13.297 --> 00:17:14.791
Well. you want
to be human rights lawyers

272
00:17:14.826 --> 00:17:16.265
so I bloody well hope not.

273
00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.762
But here's my question.

274
00:17:20.172 --> 00:17:22.733
Tell you what. everyone.
come here. Put your drinks down.

275
00:17:22.768 --> 00:17:25.043
Come round here.
Come on. chop chop.

276
00:17:25.606 --> 00:17:26.605
Over here.

277
00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:28.805
Right.

278
00:17:29.643 --> 00:17:31.247
Here's Baha Mousa.

279
00:17:31.678 --> 00:17:35.713
Face-down in the dirt with
British soldiers all around him

280
00:17:35.748 --> 00:17:38.452
with their SA80s
pointed down at him.

281
00:17:38.487 --> 00:17:42.258
That's you lot. come on.
SA80s pointed down at him.

282
00:17:45.527 --> 00:17:46.526
Now...

283
00:17:48.299 --> 00:17:51.828
we teach our soldiers how
to kill other soldiers in a war

284
00:17:51.863 --> 00:17:53.863
and there's
nothing wrong with that.

285
00:17:53.898 --> 00:17:56.866
But the judge found
that Baha Mousa died

286
00:17:56.901 --> 00:18:00.573
as a result of 93 injuries

287
00:18:00.608 --> 00:18:05.182
incurred over a 36-hour period
in British Army custody.

288
00:18:06.779 --> 00:18:08.482
I proved that case.

289
00:18:09.353 --> 00:18:12.123
But not one soldier
was found guilty of murder

290
00:18:12.158 --> 00:18:14.554
or even manslaughter
or unlawful killing.

291
00:18:15.656 --> 00:18:17.821
Is it right you guys
get away with murder?

292
00:18:18.527 --> 00:18:19.889
Put your guns down.

293
00:18:22.894 --> 00:18:26.830
So how come it's me
that's a disgrace to my country?

294
00:18:42.815 --> 00:18:45.519
Shh!
- Bloody push-ups?

295
00:18:45.818 --> 00:18:47.257
-

296
00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.470
Say if I'm
buttering too loud for you.

297
00:19:04.804 --> 00:19:07.871
Brian. I just thought you might
call out to him or something.

298
00:19:07.906 --> 00:19:09.708
I've been up with him
since four.

299
00:19:09.743 --> 00:19:11.446
I. uh...
HE COUGHS

300
00:19:12.317 --> 00:19:14.218
I tried to get up for him
but he didn't want me.

301
00:19:17.256 --> 00:19:18.519
It's gonna take time.

302
00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:23.557
You want him like this.
don't you?

303
00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:26.758
You want him all yours.

304
00:19:27.827 --> 00:19:29.596
I'm not starting all that again.

305
00:19:29.631 --> 00:19:32.236
If it's a problem at work.
let's talk about it.

306
00:19:59.463 --> 00:20:01.661
Who is it?
- Is that Phil Shiner?

307
00:20:03.929 --> 00:20:05.500
Who wants to know?

308
00:20:05.535 --> 00:20:07.502
David Monaghan.
I'm a journalist.

309
00:20:07.867 --> 00:20:08.899
You agreed to meet me.

310
00:20:18.075 --> 00:20:19.250
Did I?

311
00:20:21.518 --> 00:20:22.913
The Battle of Danny Boy.

312
00:20:24.818 --> 00:20:25.850
Right.

313
00:20:27.392 --> 00:20:28.292
Right.

314
00:20:30.692 --> 00:20:34.562
Iraqi farmers. apparently.
at work in their fields

315
00:20:35.565 --> 00:20:37.895
when the Princess of Wales
Regiment happened along.

316
00:20:41.307 --> 00:20:43.637
With Baha Mousa.
you proved a single act

317
00:20:43.672 --> 00:20:46.002
of terrible inhumanity.
This could be 20.

318
00:20:47.313 --> 00:20:48.873
It's not a head count.

319
00:20:48.908 --> 00:20:51.876
Footage of the dead bodies
was filmed by Al Jazeera and...

320
00:20:53.451 --> 00:20:55.715
there's some trophy photos
floating around

321
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:57.420
taken by British soldiers.

322
00:20:58.016 --> 00:20:59.653
The Red Cross
demanded an inquiry

323
00:20:59.688 --> 00:21:01.622
within days of what happened.

324
00:21:01.657 --> 00:21:03.690
Military Police picked it up
but it's going nowhere.

325
00:21:05.122 --> 00:21:07.364
Loads of inconsistencies
in what they did find.

326
00:21:08.895 --> 00:21:10.026
Something stinks.

327
00:21:13.438 --> 00:21:16.032
Make your programme.
Get it on the screen.

328
00:21:16.067 --> 00:21:17.968
Tell the world.
- I intend to.

329
00:21:19.741 --> 00:21:21.510
So why do you need me?

330
00:21:21.545 --> 00:21:24.073
I don't need you. Phil.
These people might.

331
00:21:27.144 --> 00:21:30.079
Have you got any idea the
amount of work this would take?

332
00:21:30.114 --> 00:21:32.290
How busy I am already?
- Just read it.

333
00:21:32.754 --> 00:21:33.885
What have you got to lose?

334
00:21:52.774 --> 00:21:53.674
Night. Phil.

335
00:21:55.007 --> 00:21:56.380
Night.

336
00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:46.496
Mazin. hi.

337
00:22:48.599 --> 00:22:50.126
Yeah. thanks
for getting back to me.

338
00:22:52.834 --> 00:22:55.406
That's right. that's right.
Listen. I might need you

339
00:22:55.441 --> 00:22:58.409
to go back to Iraq for me.
Something new.

340
00:22:58.444 --> 00:22:59.806
Same arrangement?

341
00:23:00.578 --> 00:23:02.479
Same arrangement
as before. only...

342
00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.944
the scale of this thing
could be huge

343
00:23:05.979 --> 00:23:08.749
so I'd need you
to track down witnesses

344
00:23:08.784 --> 00:23:11.081
sound them out.
and I'll meet them in Istanbul.

345
00:23:13.624 --> 00:23:14.623
Right.

346
00:23:51.992 --> 00:23:53.222
:
Babe.

347
00:23:53.928 --> 00:23:54.993
Babe.

348
00:23:55.864 --> 00:23:57.468
He went to sleep. Shh!

349
00:23:57.503 --> 00:23:59.503
:
He went to sleep! Oh!

350
00:24:01.804 --> 00:24:02.869
You're a star.

351
00:24:04.103 --> 00:24:05.608
Come on!

352
00:24:05.808 --> 00:24:07.610
That's the first time
he's went to sleep for me.

353
00:24:09.108 --> 00:24:11.009
:
I mean it. you're a star.

354
00:24:11.044 --> 00:24:13.682
You're getting there with him.
- The sleep master.

355
00:24:19.085 --> 00:24:21.250
What?
- Nothing.

356
00:24:22.286 --> 00:24:24.088
Nothing...
- No. babe. what?

357
00:24:28.127 --> 00:24:29.962
You were like you
used to be just then.

358
00:24:30.833 --> 00:24:32.470
When you came through that door.

359
00:24:33.066 --> 00:24:35.869
Can't we have a happy moment?

360
00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:38.069
I just took my son up to bed.

361
00:24:38.104 --> 00:24:39.642
I got him off to sleep
for the first time.

362
00:24:39.677 --> 00:24:41.512
That's me. I'm being a dad.
I'm being a proper dad.

363
00:24:42.075 --> 00:24:43.877
I am happy.

364
00:24:43.912 --> 00:24:44.845
You don't look happy.

365
00:24:47.179 --> 00:24:48.849
I was at the doctor today

366
00:24:48.884 --> 00:24:50.950
getting a prescription
for sleeping pills.

367
00:24:51.315 --> 00:24:54.085
Every other night. you're waking
up not knowing where you are.

368
00:24:54.989 --> 00:24:57.858
Yeah. well. no doubt about
where I am before I'm waking up.

369
00:24:58.190 --> 00:24:59.926
OK.

370
00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.897
Come on. Let's talk about that.

371
00:25:06.066 --> 00:25:07.769
What's going on. Brian?

372
00:25:09.069 --> 00:25:11.168
You really think. don't you

373
00:25:11.203 --> 00:25:14.237
that if you don't say anything's
wrong then nothing's wrong?

374
00:25:30.288 --> 00:25:31.760
I feel like you
don't want me home.

375
00:25:33.599 --> 00:25:34.290
OK?

376
00:25:38.131 --> 00:25:40.670
And I feel like every
fucking thing I do is wrong.

377
00:26:12.297 --> 00:26:13.934
I don't know
any more than you do.

378
00:26:24.144 --> 00:26:25.110
Ho!

379
00:26:26.344 --> 00:26:27.783
We going
on this run. or what?

380
00:26:56.473 --> 00:26:58.044
I thought we
were running together.

381
00:27:01.412 --> 00:27:04.787
Fifteen years retired. I am.
- Not whingeing. are we?

382
00:27:06.791 --> 00:27:08.890
It wasn't cruelty
I was teaching you. Brian.

383
00:27:09.992 --> 00:27:12.388
It was resilience.
- Yeah. I know that. Dad.

384
00:27:13.226 --> 00:27:14.764
I got that. You did that.

385
00:27:19.804 --> 00:27:20.737
Look. son...

386
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:23.366
Your mother's worried about you.

387
00:27:24.468 --> 00:27:25.973
Is everything OK
with you and Lucy?

388
00:27:27.438 --> 00:27:29.273
Yeah. No. it's. um...

389
00:27:30.749 --> 00:27:33.849
You know.
one minute I was in Al Amara

390
00:27:33.884 --> 00:27:36.181
and the next minute
I was going in through the door

391
00:27:36.216 --> 00:27:39.085
and seeing my baby boy
for the first time. so...

392
00:27:39.285 --> 00:27:40.724
You know. it's gonna. um...

393
00:27:42.959 --> 00:27:44.662
You know. it's gonna be a...

394
00:27:55.202 --> 00:27:56.399
You never killed anybody.

395
00:27:58.139 --> 00:27:59.336
No.

396
00:28:03.276 --> 00:28:04.748
It never fell to me to do it.

397
00:28:06.147 --> 00:28:07.113
But if it had. I woulda.

398
00:28:08.215 --> 00:28:10.985
Mind you. it was Northern
Ireland. it's different.

399
00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:12.789
You couldnae tell who
was friend. who was foe.

400
00:28:12.824 --> 00:28:14.516
And it's Northern Ireland.

401
00:28:14.551 --> 00:28:16.793
They're our own people.
it's the UK.

402
00:28:16.828 --> 00:28:19.829
You know. I trained for it.
and I did it and it works

403
00:28:20.766 --> 00:28:22.095
and you think...

404
00:28:22.361 --> 00:28:25.494
"Fuck." you know.
"I'm alive and he's dead."

405
00:28:26.464 --> 00:28:27.969
And then after...

406
00:28:35.176 --> 00:28:37.044
You know we're
here for you. right?

407
00:28:37.882 --> 00:28:40.817
Yeah. Then the RMP
come knocking on your door--

408
00:28:40.852 --> 00:28:43.314
The RMP? Are you kidding?

409
00:28:43.349 --> 00:28:45.756
A decorated war hero?
Tell 'em to piss off!

410
00:28:45.791 --> 00:28:48.759
You can't just tell them... They
get your head in a spin. Dad.

411
00:28:48.794 --> 00:28:50.057
You start thinking what you did

412
00:28:50.092 --> 00:28:53.093
or didn't--
- You did a good job. son.

413
00:28:53.799 --> 00:28:54.864
That's what you did.

414
00:28:56.131 --> 00:28:57.328
Hey.

415
00:28:59.563 --> 00:29:01.332
For 300 years

416
00:29:01.906 --> 00:29:03.400
this family served this country.

417
00:29:04.337 --> 00:29:05.743
Twelve generations.

418
00:29:06.372 --> 00:29:07.470
Those guys...

419
00:29:08.946 --> 00:29:10.407
they're right here with us.

420
00:29:16.019 --> 00:29:16.886
OK.

421
00:29:20.353 --> 00:29:21.385
Brian?

422
00:29:22.554 --> 00:29:25.257
Aye. he's alright. Just
doesnae like losing. that's all.

423
00:29:25.292 --> 00:29:26.797
He's not the only one.

424
00:29:26.832 --> 00:29:28.491
:
Come on. In we go.

425
00:29:37.502 --> 00:29:39.139
...your fucking mouth. mate!

426
00:29:39.174 --> 00:29:41.779
Shut your mouth!
- I tell you right now. mate.

427
00:29:45.543 --> 00:29:46.817
Get a blindfold on him!

428
00:29:49.151 --> 00:29:50.414
Where'd the rest of them go?

429
00:29:50.449 --> 00:29:52.119
They could be back any minute.
Get your cuffs on.

430
00:29:52.154 --> 00:29:53.153
Blindfolds! Blindfolds!

431
00:29:54.387 --> 00:29:56.387
- Are we good?

432
00:29:57.159 --> 00:29:59.060
Everyone OK?
- All good.

433
00:30:00.426 --> 00:30:03.262
Boys. keep your heads down.
Remember. two-way range.

434
00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.499
Is the battlefield clear?
- No. sir.

435
00:30:10.172 --> 00:30:11.105
No.

436
00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:16.110
Right. Leave this shower
to your men. You come with me.

437
00:31:11.662 --> 00:31:13.101
:
Woody. walk on!

438
00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.423
We're over-committed.
Woody. back this way. come on.

439
00:31:39.998 --> 00:31:41.393
Drop your fucking weapons!

440
00:31:41.428 --> 00:31:44.000
- Put your fucking hands up now!

441
00:31:44.266 --> 00:31:45.232
Now! Here!

442
00:31:46.235 --> 00:31:47.663
Hands up! Get your hands up
right now! To me.

443
00:31:49.271 --> 00:31:51.073
You.
- Arms.

444
00:31:54.012 --> 00:31:55.638
He's good. To me now.
- Come here.

445
00:31:55.673 --> 00:31:57.574
To me. Do you speak English?

446
00:31:58.148 --> 00:31:59.048
Stay there.

447
00:32:02.053 --> 00:32:03.448
He's clean.

448
00:32:03.483 --> 00:32:05.285
Move. now!
- Go!

449
00:32:07.058 --> 00:32:08.321
Why didn't they shoot us?

450
00:32:10.655 --> 00:32:13.656
Hey! Why didn't you shoot us?
We never even saw you.

451
00:32:16.298 --> 00:32:17.528
What kind of soldiers are you?

452
00:32:22.601 --> 00:32:23.974
Go. go!

453
00:32:25.043 --> 00:32:26.977
Keep going!
-

454
00:32:27.012 --> 00:32:28.077
Lose our lives
over a flip-flop?

455
00:32:29.212 --> 00:32:31.949
Lose this again.
I'm throwing it!

456
00:32:36.516 --> 00:32:39.088
Go! Go!
-

457
00:32:40.157 --> 00:32:41.519
Yeah. in English. mate.

458
00:32:41.554 --> 00:32:43.455
Farmer!
- Farmer?

459
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:45.127
He's a farmer?

460
00:32:45.162 --> 00:32:46.755
You're farmers.
I'm a fucking Brigadier. mate.

461
00:32:48.165 --> 00:32:49.428
How old are you?

462
00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:52.332
- Stay there.

463
00:32:55.106 --> 00:32:56.303
16!

464
00:32:56.668 --> 00:32:57.700
:
Stay there!

465
00:32:58.175 --> 00:32:59.438
Get a move on.
- Go.

466
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:02.474
Go.

467
00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:38.576
:

468
00:33:56.893 --> 00:34:00.466
:

469
00:34:00.501 --> 00:34:01.830
Has he had his expenses?

470
00:34:02.536 --> 00:34:04.536
:

471
00:34:06.672 --> 00:34:08.078
His mother has.

472
00:34:08.113 --> 00:34:11.609
Istanbul interviews. day two.
Time. 9:30am.

473
00:34:17.683 --> 00:34:21.487
He was face-down in the ditch.
He could hear soldiers coming.

474
00:34:21.819 --> 00:34:26.393
Take him back to the beginning.
Family set-up and all that.

475
00:34:28.628 --> 00:34:30.661
Mother and sister hated Saddam

476
00:34:30.696 --> 00:34:33.334
because Saddam
killed their uncle and cousin.

477
00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:36.700
All family happy to see
British soldiers when they came.

478
00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:38.405
Friends bringing freedom.

479
00:34:39.342 --> 00:34:41.210
Does he work? School?

480
00:34:56.161 --> 00:34:58.524
School in the mornings.
farm in the afternoons.

481
00:34:58.559 --> 00:35:01.098
That day he had to cut
fresh grass for his cow.

482
00:35:01.958 --> 00:35:03.562
Did he have a gun with him?

483
00:35:13.772 --> 00:35:17.213
For wolves. for bandits.
Kalashnikov.

484
00:35:19.679 --> 00:35:23.252
Er. Iraqi men in black clothes
with guns got out of trucks

485
00:35:23.287 --> 00:35:24.946
and spread in the field
near the farm.

486
00:35:29.392 --> 00:35:31.623
: And when the British
came past. there was shooting

487
00:35:31.658 --> 00:35:33.856
and he lay down in the ditch.
facing the ditch.

488
00:35:40.403 --> 00:35:43.635
He was bleeding. crying.
asking them. "Please. stop."

489
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:46.176
They drag him a long. long way

490
00:35:46.211 --> 00:35:48.409
throw him in the vehicle
with dead bodies.

491
00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:50.939
And...

492
00:35:52.349 --> 00:35:53.942
what... what happened
to his weapon?

493
00:36:01.787 --> 00:36:03.226
He didn't have weapon.

494
00:36:05.758 --> 00:36:08.495
He said just now he did.
A Kalashnikov?

495
00:36:12.996 --> 00:36:14.831
He had weapon but only at home.

496
00:36:16.604 --> 00:36:19.374
I need to know whether he was
carrying the weapon that day.

497
00:36:20.872 --> 00:36:25.413
Hm? Ask him. because in
his previous statement. here...

498
00:36:31.014 --> 00:36:32.948
:
Here. He said he had it.

499
00:36:32.983 --> 00:36:35.720
Now. if he's gonna
chop and change

500
00:36:35.755 --> 00:36:37.557
he'll be no good to me
in the witness box.

501
00:36:41.024 --> 00:36:42.826
:
As-Salaam-Alaikum.

502
00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.866
-

503
00:36:50.671 --> 00:36:52.033
What's he saying?

504
00:36:52.068 --> 00:36:53.870
He says he's been waiting
two hours and he needs to eat.

505
00:36:53.905 --> 00:36:56.004
Oh. does he need money for food?

506
00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:00.481
:

507
00:37:00.516 --> 00:37:02.252
No. he doesn't need money.
I'm telling him

508
00:37:02.287 --> 00:37:05.651
we're not finished with this guy
yet. but he's insisting.

509
00:37:05.851 --> 00:37:07.015
Maybe we are...

510
00:37:07.622 --> 00:37:10.326
Maybe we are finished here.
Thank you.

511
00:37:15.465 --> 00:37:16.695
Thank you. Please.

512
00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:24.967
Please.

513
00:37:28.379 --> 00:37:30.907
And your name is...?
- Hussein.

514
00:37:30.942 --> 00:37:32.249
:
Hussein.

515
00:37:34.748 --> 00:37:36.913
And were you at
the Battle of Danny Boy?

516
00:37:37.421 --> 00:37:39.685
Yes.
- And why were you there?

517
00:37:45.121 --> 00:37:47.022
He is saying that he is--

518
00:37:47.057 --> 00:37:48.661
Not fighter.

519
00:37:48.894 --> 00:37:51.466
I am farmer. Farmer.

520
00:37:57.606 --> 00:37:59.034
: Come on. then.
The guys are out the back.

521
00:37:59.069 --> 00:38:01.509
Hey. you alright?
Yeah! Just go through.

522
00:38:01.544 --> 00:38:02.376
Hi.

523
00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:05.909
:
Nice one. Bailey. keep bouncing!

524
00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:17.492
It's not like you. hanging back
when there's meat on the grill.

525
00:38:17.989 --> 00:38:20.627
Just taking it all in.
you know? A happy family.

526
00:38:27.636 --> 00:38:29.900
Y'know. I'm only here cos
of what two guys did out there.

527
00:38:31.376 --> 00:38:32.903
What. your mates had your back?

528
00:38:33.807 --> 00:38:35.004
It was Iraqis.

529
00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:36.643
Could've killed me. but didn't.

530
00:38:38.548 --> 00:38:40.009
What sort of soldier's that?

531
00:38:40.946 --> 00:38:42.352
What sort of soldier

532
00:38:42.387 --> 00:38:43.749
won't even fire his weapon?
- Brian--

533
00:38:43.784 --> 00:38:45.388
What sort of soldier
wears flipflops and a dishdash?

534
00:38:45.423 --> 00:38:46.323
Brian.

535
00:38:48.019 --> 00:38:49.359
You might only be here

536
00:38:49.394 --> 00:38:50.954
because of those two guys.
but you are here.

537
00:38:50.989 --> 00:38:53.121
No.
- No?

538
00:38:53.156 --> 00:38:54.659
I'm here because
they didn't do what I did.

539
00:38:58.568 --> 00:39:00.095
You said you'd have killed
if you had to.

540
00:39:05.168 --> 00:39:06.838
Well. that's when you decide
who's who.

541
00:39:09.007 --> 00:39:10.512
That moment decides for you.

542
00:39:15.453 --> 00:39:17.013
The dead have
questions for you. Brian.

543
00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:20.753
You need to answer them.

544
00:39:28.158 --> 00:39:29.762
:
Brian!

545
00:39:35.803 --> 00:39:37.132
Deep breaths. babe.
deep breaths.

546
00:39:37.167 --> 00:39:39.068
You're doing great. babe.
you're doing amazing.

547
00:39:39.103 --> 00:39:40.509
Deep breaths. babe. in and out.

548
00:39:43.712 --> 00:39:45.547
I want my mum.
- She's on her way.

549
00:39:45.582 --> 00:39:47.549
I can't do this.
- Yes. you can. babe.

550
00:39:47.584 --> 00:39:48.880
You don't know
what I can and can't do.

551
00:39:48.915 --> 00:39:50.486
I do. babe! I know you.

552
00:40:06.097 --> 00:40:07.965
:
It is our contention

553
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.067
that British soldiers
abused and mistreated Iraqis

554
00:40:11.102 --> 00:40:12.970
on the battlefield at Danny Boy

555
00:40:13.005 --> 00:40:17.007
and afterwards at their base.
at Camp Abu Naji.

556
00:40:18.945 --> 00:40:20.109
More than that...

557
00:40:21.378 --> 00:40:25.180
we believe that many of those
killed. injured or detained...

558
00:40:26.755 --> 00:40:28.183
were not soldiers at all.

559
00:40:29.659 --> 00:40:32.528
There were farmers there.
and innocent bystanders

560
00:40:32.563 --> 00:40:34.222
going about
their daily business.

561
00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:39.700
We believe that the Army
carried out unlawful killings.

562
00:40:39.735 --> 00:40:42.098
Perhaps up to 20.
-

563
00:40:43.805 --> 00:40:45.475
Any questions. please?

564
00:40:45.708 --> 00:40:47.202
:
So the Iraqis were executed?

565
00:40:48.304 --> 00:40:49.941
: That's what
we need to find out.

566
00:40:51.307 --> 00:40:53.648
It's normal in that
lawless part of Iraq

567
00:40:53.683 --> 00:40:55.716
for farmers to carry guns. but

568
00:40:56.147 --> 00:40:57.619
does that make them soldiers?

569
00:41:00.987 --> 00:41:03.251
: British soldiers
are held to high standards

570
00:41:03.286 --> 00:41:04.890
and rightly so.

571
00:41:04.925 --> 00:41:08.124
I see it as part of my job
to hold them to that.

572
00:41:08.159 --> 00:41:10.896
And in my view.
there is powerful evidence

573
00:41:10.931 --> 00:41:14.196
that on the day in question.
they let this country down.

574
00:41:14.231 --> 00:41:16.099
:
So categorically. you're saying

575
00:41:16.134 --> 00:41:18.739
British soldiers
killed civilians in cold blood?

576
00:41:18.774 --> 00:41:21.038
: What I'm saying
is the Army's own

577
00:41:21.073 --> 00:41:23.909
Military Police investigation
closed too soon.

578
00:41:23.944 --> 00:41:25.240
It wasn't good enough.

579
00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:28.914
That's why we've
called upon the government

580
00:41:28.949 --> 00:41:31.587
to set up
a full public inquiry.

581
00:41:31.622 --> 00:41:33.622
:
Brian's phone. Leave a message.

582
00:41:33.657 --> 00:41:35.118
We don't want
to be talked about

583
00:41:35.153 --> 00:41:36.955
in the same way as the Japanese

584
00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:40.090
in the Second World War.
or the Americans at My Lai.

585
00:41:40.125 --> 00:41:42.730
We need to get this
all out in the open

586
00:41:42.765 --> 00:41:45.535
and only a public inquiry
can do that.

587
00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:47.163
:
Several years have passed

588
00:41:47.198 --> 00:41:49.198
since the Battle of Danny Boy.
and the Ministry of Defence

589
00:41:49.233 --> 00:41:51.200
insists the allegations
are unfounded

590
00:41:51.642 --> 00:41:53.301
but has promised
its full cooperation.

591
00:41:56.141 --> 00:41:57.877
It's a summons
to a public inquiry.

592
00:42:02.213 --> 00:42:04.048
This guy. Shiner--
- He's all talk.

593
00:42:05.018 --> 00:42:07.557
Well. he's not all talk. is he?
- It'll come to nothing.

594
00:42:09.253 --> 00:42:10.659
:
You're not looking!

595
00:42:12.861 --> 00:42:13.761
:
Smile!

596
00:42:16.062 --> 00:42:18.062
You know how you
used to complain about me

597
00:42:18.097 --> 00:42:19.536
not wanting to know
what you'd done

598
00:42:20.264 --> 00:42:22.539
when you got your medal?
- I was always joking.

599
00:42:23.674 --> 00:42:27.104
It's you I wanted.
not your medal.

600
00:42:27.139 --> 00:42:28.171
Yeah. I know.

601
00:42:29.845 --> 00:42:30.844
Do you?

602
00:42:35.015 --> 00:42:36.179
Yeah.

603
00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:40.150
Good.

604
00:42:56.872 --> 00:42:59.675
Right. show me
that fucking thing!

605
00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:01.611
:
Gavin! The baby.

606
00:43:02.845 --> 00:43:03.646
The baby.

607
00:43:05.683 --> 00:43:06.308
Sorry. love.

608
00:43:07.817 --> 00:43:08.750
Aye. he's lovely.

609
00:43:10.985 --> 00:43:11.852
Hi.

610
00:43:14.791 --> 00:43:16.252
:
Give you a medal wi' one hand

611
00:43:16.287 --> 00:43:17.660
and knock your teeth oot
wi' the other.

612
00:43:18.256 --> 00:43:19.761
They accuse
you of these things

613
00:43:19.796 --> 00:43:22.027
our own government
accuses you of these things

614
00:43:22.062 --> 00:43:23.633
on the say-so of what?

615
00:43:23.668 --> 00:43:25.030
The men who
were trying to kill you?

616
00:43:26.264 --> 00:43:28.704
"In the Northern engagement.
you participated in

617
00:43:28.739 --> 00:43:30.871
witnessed or were aware of."
I mean. which one is it?

618
00:43:30.906 --> 00:43:31.938
Jesus Christ.

619
00:43:33.711 --> 00:43:35.139
There's 11 counts here.
You must've been busy.

620
00:43:35.174 --> 00:43:36.305
That's all I can say.

621
00:43:38.045 --> 00:43:39.814
They probably sent the
same letter to all of us. Dad.

622
00:43:39.849 --> 00:43:41.178
No. no way. Look.

623
00:43:42.346 --> 00:43:44.654
"In the course of clearing
the trench with CSM Falconer

624
00:43:44.689 --> 00:43:47.151
and others. you were..."
Blah-blah-blah. You.

625
00:43:47.186 --> 00:43:48.350
Nobody else. You.

626
00:43:50.728 --> 00:43:53.421
The solicitors for the Iraqis
are saying that they were. um...

627
00:43:55.095 --> 00:43:56.666
farmers and not militia.

628
00:43:56.701 --> 00:43:58.668
Are they trying to tell me
you wouldnae know the difference

629
00:43:58.703 --> 00:43:59.900
between a farmer
and a trained killer

630
00:43:59.935 --> 00:44:01.132
working for what-was-his-name?

631
00:44:01.167 --> 00:44:02.364
Muqtada al-Sadr.
- God's sake.

632
00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:05.070
Public inquiry.

633
00:44:05.875 --> 00:44:06.907
The world's gone mad.

634
00:44:27.193 --> 00:44:28.489
:
Listen up. New orders.

635
00:44:28.524 --> 00:44:29.996
We've got to pick up
the enemy dead

636
00:44:30.031 --> 00:44:31.162
and bring them back with us.

637
00:44:32.365 --> 00:44:34.330
Intel reports person
of interest in the field today.

638
00:44:34.805 --> 00:44:36.134
Whose orders is this?

639
00:44:37.071 --> 00:44:39.973
: No one does this.
We shouldn't be doing it.

640
00:44:42.912 --> 00:44:44.208
Fuck this!

641
00:44:44.243 --> 00:44:46.749
They think some local warlord
is among the dead.

642
00:44:46.784 --> 00:44:48.509
So we're taking the
bodies back for ID-ing.

643
00:44:48.544 --> 00:44:50.049
Falconer picked us out for it.

644
00:44:52.284 --> 00:44:54.757
Right. I'll pick him up.

645
00:44:54.792 --> 00:44:56.385
You yank his trousers back up.

646
00:44:56.959 --> 00:44:58.090
What?

647
00:44:59.896 --> 00:45:01.357
Who did all that?

648
00:45:03.559 --> 00:45:07.429
Chain gun could do that.
A 30mm tank shell.

649
00:45:10.467 --> 00:45:12.137
Killing someone's one thing.

650
00:45:13.877 --> 00:45:16.405
Picking them up after.
looking them in the eye...

651
00:45:19.278 --> 00:45:20.915
Tell you what I don't see.

652
00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:23.280
I don't see any village elders
who sent these kids out here

653
00:45:23.315 --> 00:45:26.448
with rifles against a company
full of tanks and Warriors.

654
00:46:33.649 --> 00:46:35.055
:
Drop your fucking weapons!

655
00:46:36.355 --> 00:46:38.124
Killing someone's one thing.

656
00:46:38.159 --> 00:46:39.994
Picking them up after.
looking them in the eye...

657
00:46:40.524 --> 00:46:42.293
Why didn't they shoot us?

658
00:46:42.328 --> 00:46:43.998
Why didn't you shoot us?
We never even saw you.

659
00:46:44.396 --> 00:46:45.494
What kind of soldiers are you?

660
00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:54.910
:
Hey. Hey.

661
00:46:55.143 --> 00:46:56.912
Come on. Come here.

662
00:46:56.947 --> 00:46:59.046
Come on. Hey. come on.

663
00:47:00.181 --> 00:47:01.246
It's alright.

664
00:47:01.281 --> 00:47:02.412
It's alright.

665
00:47:03.888 --> 00:47:06.383
I'm here. Come on. Come inside.

666
00:47:07.991 --> 00:47:08.957
Inside.

667
00:47:30.046 --> 00:47:32.211
: When the judges
approved our judicial review

668
00:47:32.477 --> 00:47:36.248
they slammed the Military Police
and the Ministry of Defence

669
00:47:36.283 --> 00:47:38.184
for not going far enough.

670
00:47:38.384 --> 00:47:41.220
Took our side
on every point of substance.

671
00:47:42.091 --> 00:47:45.422
Left the government no option
but a full public inquiry.

672
00:47:45.655 --> 00:47:47.094
Listen to this. Patrick.

673
00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:49.459
It's not some
Guardian editorial.

674
00:47:49.494 --> 00:47:51.560
This is from
the judge's own ruling.

675
00:47:51.595 --> 00:47:53.969
"In our view. the
Military Police investigation

676
00:47:54.004 --> 00:47:56.367
relating to allegations
of murder and torture

677
00:47:56.402 --> 00:47:59.271
was deficient."
It wasn't fit for purpose.

678
00:47:59.702 --> 00:48:02.043
No major incident room.

679
00:48:02.078 --> 00:48:05.981
Failure to identity or interview
relevant personnel.

680
00:48:06.313 --> 00:48:10.018
Failure to seize all
contemporaneous records.

681
00:48:10.053 --> 00:48:11.954
Failure to interview
the detainees.

682
00:48:11.989 --> 00:48:13.549
Well. you've done
an amazing job. Phil

683
00:48:13.584 --> 00:48:15.254
no one's doubting that.

684
00:48:15.289 --> 00:48:18.092
Getting a public inquiry awarded
is an extraordinary achievement

685
00:48:18.127 --> 00:48:19.390
for a practice this size.

686
00:48:20.261 --> 00:48:21.359
But?

687
00:48:22.197 --> 00:48:23.394
But nothing.

688
00:48:23.429 --> 00:48:26.001
So. the eminent barrister's
coming on board?

689
00:48:26.036 --> 00:48:28.234
Coming on with
the legal team who. uh...

690
00:48:28.269 --> 00:48:29.301
Hang on.

691
00:48:30.073 --> 00:48:31.270
Where is it?

692
00:48:31.305 --> 00:48:34.075
How did the judges
describe us. Deena?

693
00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:36.077
They said we were
greatly outnumbered

694
00:48:36.112 --> 00:48:37.540
by the Secretary of State's
legal team

695
00:48:37.575 --> 00:48:41.082
but persisted with requests
for disclosure skilfully

696
00:48:41.117 --> 00:48:42.644
and with
commendable determination.

697
00:48:42.679 --> 00:48:44.514
Commendable determination.
Patrick.

698
00:48:44.549 --> 00:48:46.516
Couldn't have put it
better myself.

699
00:48:46.551 --> 00:48:49.057
That war shames
our nation. Patrick.

700
00:48:49.092 --> 00:48:50.619
That's not what
the inquiry is about.

701
00:48:52.392 --> 00:48:54.689
Ever thought of getting
a bigger office. Phil?

702
00:48:55.098 --> 00:48:57.527
Having the walls closing in
concentrates the mind.

703
00:48:57.562 --> 00:49:00.068
Doesn't it. Deena?
- That's the theory. yes.

704
00:49:00.103 --> 00:49:02.235
Right. so. what have you got?

705
00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:04.699
"We". Patrick. We. Come on.

706
00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:09.638
We've got 20 dead Iraqis
taken off the battlefield.

707
00:49:09.673 --> 00:49:11.211
Taken why?

708
00:49:11.246 --> 00:49:12.773
The Army says
they needed to ID the bodies

709
00:49:12.808 --> 00:49:14.742
but our witnesses say
at least some of them were alive

710
00:49:14.777 --> 00:49:16.282
when they left the battlefield.

711
00:49:16.317 --> 00:49:18.581
And some of them were beaten
and shot back at the camp

712
00:49:18.616 --> 00:49:20.253
after they were detained.

713
00:49:20.288 --> 00:49:23.091
More to the point. the Army
say they were combatants

714
00:49:23.126 --> 00:49:24.587
and the families say
they weren't.

715
00:49:24.622 --> 00:49:26.754
What are you looking for?
- The trophy pictures.

716
00:49:26.789 --> 00:49:28.360
Over there.
-

717
00:49:29.099 --> 00:49:31.726
Shift your arse. Patrick.
You're sitting on Exhibit A.

718
00:49:31.761 --> 00:49:33.398
: Public Interest
Lawyers. Hi. Carrie.

719
00:49:33.433 --> 00:49:35.136
Is that...?
- Yeah.

720
00:49:35.171 --> 00:49:36.467
Show these to Patrick.

721
00:49:36.502 --> 00:49:38.007
I'll pass you over to him.

722
00:49:38.042 --> 00:49:39.767
Carrie? Hi. yes. I've got...

723
00:49:39.802 --> 00:49:42.209
So these are photos
taken by soldiers on the day.

724
00:49:42.244 --> 00:49:44.343
You can see blood on
the soldiers' hands in this one.

725
00:49:45.115 --> 00:49:47.181
Why do the Army need
to take dead Iraqis for ID-ing

726
00:49:47.216 --> 00:49:48.776
if they had all these
cameras in the field?

727
00:49:48.811 --> 00:49:51.647
Exactly! Carrie. I'm gonna
pass you back to Deena.

728
00:49:51.682 --> 00:49:53.319
One second.
- Oh.

729
00:49:54.157 --> 00:49:56.586
Hi. Carrie...
- There were cameras everywhere.

730
00:49:56.621 --> 00:49:58.357
It doesn't make sense.

731
00:49:58.656 --> 00:49:59.996
Look at these.

732
00:50:01.165 --> 00:50:03.131
Look at the condition of
these prisoners. It's shameful.

733
00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:05.100
I interviewed this guy
in Istanbul.

734
00:50:05.135 --> 00:50:07.762
He's willing to testify.
He's just a farmer.

735
00:50:07.797 --> 00:50:09.269
Almost all of them

736
00:50:09.304 --> 00:50:11.040
say they were denied water.
-

737
00:50:11.075 --> 00:50:12.239
They've clearly
been knocked about.

738
00:50:12.274 --> 00:50:13.834
It's a fucking disgrace.
Patrick

739
00:50:13.869 --> 00:50:15.572
and it's our chance
to expose it.

740
00:50:15.607 --> 00:50:17.376
Our duty to expose it.

741
00:50:17.411 --> 00:50:18.674
:
Phil. that's another delivery.

742
00:50:18.709 --> 00:50:20.214
Well. can you deal with it?

743
00:50:20.249 --> 00:50:22.381
The Iraqi witnesses.
what's your process there?

744
00:50:22.416 --> 00:50:24.515
Er. vetted by my man in Iraq.

745
00:50:24.550 --> 00:50:26.484
If he thinks
they've got what it takes

746
00:50:26.519 --> 00:50:28.090
then I meet them

747
00:50:28.125 --> 00:50:30.158
on neutral ground in Istanbul.
-

748
00:50:30.490 --> 00:50:31.621
The funding?

749
00:50:31.656 --> 00:50:33.326
:
The High Court ordered the MOD

750
00:50:33.361 --> 00:50:35.757
to reimburse all our costs
getting us this far.

751
00:50:35.792 --> 00:50:37.066
:
Door's open. come on up.

752
00:50:37.101 --> 00:50:38.562
You know how many
gallantry awards

753
00:50:38.597 --> 00:50:39.596
went to the soldiers
at Danny Boy?

754
00:50:40.236 --> 00:50:41.268
Ten.

755
00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:42.830
And to a man.
they'll be saying

756
00:50:42.865 --> 00:50:44.667
the Iraqi witnesses are liars.

757
00:50:44.702 --> 00:50:47.175
That the men they killed
were soldiers. shot in battle.

758
00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:49.111
No one was mistreated.
- : Course they will.

759
00:50:49.839 --> 00:50:51.872
But you and I know
what British soldiers

760
00:50:51.907 --> 00:50:53.808
are capable of doing
to detainees.

761
00:50:53.843 --> 00:50:56.184
Baha Mousa proved that.

762
00:50:56.219 --> 00:50:58.186
And this is just as
grave and important as that.

763
00:50:59.387 --> 00:51:02.256
Only more sprawling.
- That's an understatement.

764
00:51:03.787 --> 00:51:06.689
It's an uphill struggle.
Patrick. I get that.

765
00:51:06.724 --> 00:51:08.229
It always is.

766
00:51:08.264 --> 00:51:10.660
There's 40 shipping
containers of disclosure

767
00:51:10.695 --> 00:51:11.760
for us to wade through.

768
00:51:11.795 --> 00:51:14.103
: Signature. please.
- Hm? Oh.

769
00:51:15.634 --> 00:51:18.404
This is the MOD
sending us a haystack. saying

770
00:51:18.439 --> 00:51:20.340
"Good luck finding
the needle." Thanks.

771
00:51:20.375 --> 00:51:21.836
Do you want this job
or don't you?

772
00:51:21.871 --> 00:51:24.113
Cos. as you can probably see

773
00:51:24.148 --> 00:51:25.708
we've got a lot of work
to get through.

774
00:51:27.184 --> 00:51:28.711
I'll start with a sandwich.
- Hm?

775
00:51:30.451 --> 00:51:32.847
Well. they've got crusts on.
Patrick.

776
00:51:32.882 --> 00:51:34.486
Do you think you
can cope with that?

777
00:51:38.756 --> 00:51:41.394
You struggling. Dad?
- Are you havin' a laugh?

778
00:51:41.627 --> 00:51:44.265
Think I cannae
handle a couple of suitcases?

779
00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:46.366
I'll put you through
some proper PT. boy.

780
00:51:46.401 --> 00:51:48.236
Now don't you be worrying.
either of you.

781
00:51:48.271 --> 00:51:49.798
Not gonna worry.
- Call us any time.

782
00:51:49.833 --> 00:51:51.173
Alright.
- We're off.

783
00:51:51.208 --> 00:51:53.175
Good luck.
- See you when I see you.

784
00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:54.671
I'll give you a bell
when we get back.

785
00:51:54.706 --> 00:51:56.838
What's going on. little man?
- : He loves that boy.

786
00:51:56.873 --> 00:51:58.444
Loves them both.

787
00:51:58.479 --> 00:51:59.874
Alright. hen?
You heard what Margaret said.

788
00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:02.613
Get him back for me.

789
00:52:04.617 --> 00:52:06.188
Getting angry at
what's happening to him...

790
00:52:07.488 --> 00:52:09.257
It's not the same
as getting him through it.

791
00:52:18.499 --> 00:52:20.466
Are you trying to tell me
how to father my son?

792
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:25.405
You've done a very good
job of fathering him. Gavin.

793
00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:29.178
He's just like you.
He's a soldier. like you.

794
00:52:29.213 --> 00:52:31.180
He keeps it all in-house.
like you.

795
00:52:31.908 --> 00:52:33.611
He doesn't let on
what's going on up here

796
00:52:33.646 --> 00:52:35.184
and he really thinks
that's working.

797
00:52:36.781 --> 00:52:38.220
He's like you.

798
00:52:38.684 --> 00:52:39.947
He's just like you.

799
00:52:46.692 --> 00:52:48.758
:
Point two. Charlie. eh?

800
00:52:50.234 --> 00:52:53.235
Point two. Oh! Is that
the one you want to hear?

801
00:52:53.666 --> 00:52:54.995
OK.

802
00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:56.337
Point two.

803
00:52:56.372 --> 00:52:58.405
"That you've given...

804
00:52:59.276 --> 00:53:02.508
an untruthful
and/or inaccurate account

805
00:53:03.478 --> 00:53:06.644
in suggesting that the
Iraqis you apprehended

806
00:53:06.679 --> 00:53:08.679
had with them
any weapons at all.

807
00:53:09.550 --> 00:53:12.485
You're incorrect
to suggest or imply

808
00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:17.259
that they had been
shooting at... British troops."

809
00:53:17.294 --> 00:53:19.624
Three.

810
00:53:20.627 --> 00:53:23.430
"Any failure to
report the misconduct or...

811
00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:28.765
or the allegations of misconduct
of which you were aware

812
00:53:29.064 --> 00:53:31.405
is the direct result...

813
00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:33.968
...by you. deliberately...

814
00:53:35.873 --> 00:53:37.906
to conceal the misconduct
of others."

815
00:53:50.426 --> 00:53:51.854
What kind of soldiers are you?

816
00:53:52.824 --> 00:53:54.659
What's that?
- Hm?

817
00:53:56.597 --> 00:53:57.827
What was what. sir?

818
00:54:00.029 --> 00:54:03.437
See you got a letter. then.
Woody. That from the inquiry?

819
00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:05.670
Yeah. I did. sir.

820
00:54:06.673 --> 00:54:07.573
Me too.

821
00:54:09.346 --> 00:54:10.675
How's that sitting
with you now. then?

822
00:54:12.877 --> 00:54:14.008
I love soldiering. sir.

823
00:54:15.649 --> 00:54:16.780
I do. but...

824
00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:18.947
right now. it's...

825
00:54:20.357 --> 00:54:22.324
Train you up.
send you out to fight

826
00:54:22.359 --> 00:54:23.820
then you get back
for questioning.

827
00:54:23.855 --> 00:54:26.020
I mean. what's that about?
- Yeah. they were firing at us.

828
00:54:26.055 --> 00:54:27.956
Yeah. live rounds.

829
00:54:28.530 --> 00:54:31.762
And. no. I didn't...
gouge anyone's eye out.

830
00:54:33.634 --> 00:54:34.831
You had all that. too?

831
00:54:35.801 --> 00:54:36.866
Yeah.

832
00:54:38.903 --> 00:54:40.309
Still think about them days?

833
00:54:41.345 --> 00:54:42.641
Danny Boy and the rest?

834
00:54:43.512 --> 00:54:44.907
Five years ago now. More.

835
00:54:48.682 --> 00:54:50.011
I do. sir.

836
00:54:50.948 --> 00:54:51.947
Yeah.

837
00:54:53.423 --> 00:54:54.389
Tough days.

838
00:54:56.085 --> 00:54:57.084
Punchy days.

839
00:54:59.594 --> 00:55:00.593
Yeah.

840
00:55:01.728 --> 00:55:03.024
Immense.

841
00:55:07.602 --> 00:55:09.470
Who do you talk to
about them days?

842
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:13.100
Prefer to just sort of...

843
00:55:14.774 --> 00:55:17.478
you know.
keep it where it is. sir.

844
00:55:17.513 --> 00:55:18.611
For the time being.

845
00:55:18.646 --> 00:55:20.448
Got a shifting cargo.
though. Woody.

846
00:55:20.813 --> 00:55:21.944
You sure that's a good idea?

847
00:55:24.179 --> 00:55:25.486
Ever thought
about knocking on a door

848
00:55:25.521 --> 00:55:26.718
and getting some help with that?

849
00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:29.457
I'm fine. sir.

850
00:55:29.492 --> 00:55:30.821
You were just a kid then. Woody.

851
00:55:32.594 --> 00:55:33.560
But you're not now.

852
00:55:35.498 --> 00:55:36.629
Knock on a door.

853
00:55:39.535 --> 00:55:40.600
I did.

854
00:55:56.585 --> 00:55:58.684
OK. Stress test.

855
00:55:59.148 --> 00:56:00.917
Their claims against ours.

856
00:56:01.524 --> 00:56:02.688
Deena.

857
00:56:02.954 --> 00:56:04.954
The orders
to take away the bodies.

858
00:56:04.989 --> 00:56:06.560
Everything flows from that.

859
00:56:06.958 --> 00:56:08.727
If they were dead.
like the Army says

860
00:56:08.762 --> 00:56:11.598
removing them is unprecedented
and needs a better explanation.

861
00:56:11.633 --> 00:56:13.864
If they were alive.
like the families say...

862
00:56:14.933 --> 00:56:16.097
then they must've
been executed.

863
00:56:16.539 --> 00:56:18.902
Hm. So who gave that order?

864
00:56:20.004 --> 00:56:21.509
No one seems to know.

865
00:56:23.172 --> 00:56:25.678
If the dead bodies
needed ID-ing

866
00:56:25.944 --> 00:56:28.516
why didn't they
photograph them there? Hm?

867
00:56:30.047 --> 00:56:31.684
Instead of transporting them.

868
00:56:32.522 --> 00:56:35.556
The trophy pictures show
that there were cameras present.

869
00:56:38.154 --> 00:56:39.153
If you were an Iraqi mother

870
00:56:39.188 --> 00:56:40.891
searching through
shredded bodies

871
00:56:40.926 --> 00:56:42.530
in a morgue two days later

872
00:56:42.565 --> 00:56:44.191
you would suspect
something very bad.

873
00:56:45.095 --> 00:56:46.831
Lots of unanswered questions.

874
00:56:48.835 --> 00:56:49.867
Patrick.

875
00:56:50.936 --> 00:56:52.199
Bit of balance?

876
00:56:53.477 --> 00:56:54.575
Well. the inquiry
will want to test

877
00:56:54.610 --> 00:56:56.038
the credibility
of the witnesses.

878
00:56:56.073 --> 00:56:57.644
When did their injuries occur?

879
00:56:57.679 --> 00:56:58.843
How can anyone be sure

880
00:56:58.878 --> 00:57:00.075
they weren't members
of a militia group?

881
00:57:00.110 --> 00:57:01.208
And the dead. too.
for that matter--

882
00:57:01.243 --> 00:57:02.682
The militia stuff...

883
00:57:03.951 --> 00:57:05.817
Neither side can prove that.
That's our word against theirs.

884
00:57:05.852 --> 00:57:07.984
It's not "our" word. Phil.
it's the witnesses'.

885
00:57:08.690 --> 00:57:11.526
We present their evidence
to the inquiry. we don't own it.

886
00:57:12.254 --> 00:57:13.561
Very noble. Patrick.

887
00:57:15.829 --> 00:57:17.961
Why did the Military Police
drop their investigation?

888
00:57:19.668 --> 00:57:21.096
Incompetence or cover-up?

889
00:57:21.131 --> 00:57:22.603
OK. what do we say to that one?

890
00:57:22.638 --> 00:57:24.770
We say incompetence
or cover-up. Anything else?

891
00:57:24.805 --> 00:57:26.673
As I'm reading. I'm trying
to put myself in the position

892
00:57:26.708 --> 00:57:28.708
of the Army soldiers.
- Useful exercise.

893
00:57:28.743 --> 00:57:30.270
If you're fired up
and you've been shot at

894
00:57:30.305 --> 00:57:32.074
and you're charging
across a field

895
00:57:32.109 --> 00:57:33.548
and someone puts
their hands up...

896
00:57:34.848 --> 00:57:36.716
where does the war bit stop

897
00:57:36.751 --> 00:57:38.883
and the arrest
and restraint bit start?

898
00:57:38.918 --> 00:57:40.918
: That's the inquiry's
focus in a nutshell.

899
00:57:40.953 --> 00:57:42.623
What happens after
the war bit stops?

900
00:57:42.658 --> 00:57:45.021
It's grey... It's a grey area.

901
00:57:45.595 --> 00:57:46.253
OK.

902
00:57:47.223 --> 00:57:49.058
It is. So. you're fired up

903
00:57:49.962 --> 00:57:51.258
you've been shot at

904
00:57:51.634 --> 00:57:54.998
you've taken a guy
with his hands up prisoner

905
00:57:55.704 --> 00:57:57.902
and you live that grey area.
you're in it.

906
00:58:00.071 --> 00:58:02.236
Maybe you knock him about.
Is that what you're saying?

907
00:58:02.271 --> 00:58:04.645
Why wouldn't you?
- I guess.

908
00:58:05.010 --> 00:58:07.175
Hm. Well. here's your answer.

909
00:58:09.212 --> 00:58:11.080
Because
they're British soldiers.

910
00:58:11.852 --> 00:58:12.884
They're trained

911
00:58:12.919 --> 00:58:14.985
to be better than that.
- Right.

912
00:58:15.020 --> 00:58:17.053
I mean. either they are
or they aren't. Right?

913
00:58:18.188 --> 00:58:20.628
Either they are better
than that or they're not.

914
00:58:24.898 --> 00:58:26.227
Sorry. Have to take this.

915
00:58:27.263 --> 00:58:29.098
Hello? Yeah.

916
00:58:29.573 --> 00:58:30.968
And...

917
00:58:32.873 --> 00:58:34.642
Go on.
-

918
00:58:34.677 --> 00:58:37.645
The arrangements we used
to gather our witnesses

919
00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:39.306
the fact that we've
operated through a middleman

920
00:58:39.341 --> 00:58:41.616
some of the financial
arrangements...

921
00:58:41.651 --> 00:58:42.518
What?

922
00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:48.216
Well... is all of that
definitely OK?

923
00:58:50.924 --> 00:58:52.990
We literally had no choice.

924
00:58:54.895 --> 00:58:59.161
Either we let the killings of
20 potentially innocent Iraqis

925
00:58:59.196 --> 00:59:02.604
go unchallenged.
or we do what we did.

926
00:59:03.068 --> 00:59:04.298
What choice did we have?

927
00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:07.543
If we win.
it'll all be forgotten.

928
00:59:08.370 --> 00:59:10.172
If we lose.
it'll all be irrelevant.

929
00:59:22.725 --> 00:59:24.593
: Can't abide
the coffee they have here.

930
00:59:25.728 --> 00:59:27.695
But if I leave my
good coffee in the kitchen

931
00:59:27.730 --> 00:59:28.795
everyone drinks it.

932
00:59:29.699 --> 00:59:31.325
I've had your statement typed up

933
00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:34.603
into the same basic form
as the other soldiers.

934
00:59:34.638 --> 00:59:36.132
I want you to
read it through now

935
00:59:36.167 --> 00:59:38.266
and say if it's an accurate
reflection of what you told me.

936
00:59:41.073 --> 00:59:42.842
Let's have it out loud.

937
00:59:43.042 --> 00:59:44.613
There's a good chap.

938
00:59:44.648 --> 00:59:45.372
It's good practice.

939
00:59:45.946 --> 00:59:46.978
Yeah.

940
00:59:57.320 --> 01:00:02.224
"I deployed to Iraq
on the 8th of April 2004

941
01:00:02.259 --> 01:00:04.699
in support of Operation TELIC 4.

942
01:00:06.703 --> 01:00:10.903
I deployed as a Lance Corporal
with A Platoon. C Company

943
01:00:10.938 --> 01:00:13.367
1st Battalion. the Princess
of Wales's Royal Regiment.

944
01:00:16.713 --> 01:00:19.076
This was my first
deployment to Iraq.

945
01:00:19.111 --> 01:00:21.342
My role was as
dismount commander

946
01:00:21.916 --> 01:00:24.048
and I would rarely
get out of the Warrior

947
01:00:24.083 --> 01:00:26.083
as we would be
vulnerable to incoming fire.

948
01:00:26.118 --> 01:00:28.987
The plan was to go
to the side of trench one

949
01:00:29.022 --> 01:00:30.659
and take the enemy by surprise.

950
01:00:30.694 --> 01:00:32.056
Three of us returned fire

951
01:00:32.091 --> 01:00:34.256
in an attempt to
suppress the enemy position.

952
01:00:34.291 --> 01:00:35.829
When I reached the trench

953
01:00:35.864 --> 01:00:38.700
there were still four
enemy combatants within it.

954
01:00:38.735 --> 01:00:41.098
One of them
was shouting in Arabic.

955
01:00:43.135 --> 01:00:45.806
: He had his hands in
the air and continued to shout.

956
01:00:45.841 --> 01:00:47.643
Get down! Get down!

957
01:00:47.909 --> 01:00:50.844
I shouted back at him
something along the lines of...

958
01:00:51.176 --> 01:00:52.780
Get your fucking hands up!

959
01:00:52.815 --> 01:00:54.078
:
"Put your fucking hands up."

960
01:00:54.751 --> 01:00:56.311
The detainees were
grabbed by their clothes

961
01:00:56.346 --> 01:00:58.379
or arms and forced down.

962
01:00:58.414 --> 01:01:00.447
There was a large
number of weapons.

963
01:01:00.482 --> 01:01:02.053
Once the search
had been completed

964
01:01:02.088 --> 01:01:03.351
the detainees' hands
were plasticuffed

965
01:01:03.386 --> 01:01:04.485
and they were blindfolded.

966
01:01:04.521 --> 01:01:07.058
CSM Falconer took
charge of the situation

967
01:01:07.093 --> 01:01:08.455
and said that he and I
were to advance

968
01:01:08.490 --> 01:01:09.689
to trench two
to check it was clear.

969
01:01:09.725 --> 01:01:13.031
I saw an enemy combatant
stand up and aim at CSM Falconer

970
01:01:13.066 --> 01:01:14.299
who reacted very quickly.

971
01:01:14.334 --> 01:01:17.167
Immediately after this.
I saw another aimed at me.

972
01:01:17.202 --> 01:01:19.708
I fired two rounds at him
and saw him drop to the ground.

973
01:01:19.743 --> 01:01:21.072
As we were walking back

974
01:01:21.107 --> 01:01:22.843
two enemy emerged
with their hands up.

975
01:01:23.076 --> 01:01:25.780
We had not seen them
or been aware of them at all.

976
01:01:25.815 --> 01:01:27.507
It was lucky for us
that they chose to surrender

977
01:01:27.542 --> 01:01:28.750
rather than engage.

978
01:01:34.219 --> 01:01:36.692
The order to collect the dead
was an unusual order.

979
01:01:37.761 --> 01:01:39.827
It would be normal to leave
the dead on the battlefield.

980
01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:44.425
I had not been in
such a situation previously

981
01:01:44.933 --> 01:01:47.098
and collecting the dead
was a horrible job

982
01:01:47.133 --> 01:01:48.495
that no one wanted to do.

983
01:02:01.785 --> 01:02:03.114
I was not offered
any counselling

984
01:02:03.149 --> 01:02:04.445
when I returned from my tour.

985
01:02:05.514 --> 01:02:07.217
I do not recall
attending any debrief

986
01:02:07.252 --> 01:02:08.515
at the end of my tour either.

987
01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:13.289
I believe the facts in this
witness statement are true."

988
01:02:18.197 --> 01:02:19.229
:
OK.

989
01:02:23.334 --> 01:02:24.465
Well done.

990
01:02:36.281 --> 01:02:37.412
You alright?

991
01:02:44.058 --> 01:02:44.991
Hang on.

992
01:02:56.037 --> 01:02:57.333
Isn't he home?

993
01:02:57.368 --> 01:02:59.071
He's usually home by now.

994
01:02:59.106 --> 01:03:00.270
Uh. yeah. I don't know.

995
01:03:02.978 --> 01:03:04.142
You haven't knocked?

996
01:03:11.250 --> 01:03:12.216
You were right.

997
01:03:14.319 --> 01:03:15.582
You were right in what you said.

998
01:03:18.928 --> 01:03:19.993
OK.

999
01:03:21.898 --> 01:03:23.524
Do you wanna come in?
- No. just...

1000
01:03:23.559 --> 01:03:25.592
Just get Brian out here for me.
will you. love?

1001
01:03:51.653 --> 01:03:53.026
Brian.
- Dad.

1002
01:04:07.009 --> 01:04:08.272
You know I love you. son.

1003
01:04:11.046 --> 01:04:12.474
Up to now. maybe.
Is that what you're saying?

1004
01:04:12.509 --> 01:04:14.443
See. that's just exactly it.
That's...

1005
01:04:15.149 --> 01:04:17.413
That's exactly it. That's where
Lucy's got her head screwed on

1006
01:04:17.448 --> 01:04:19.987
and me and you havnae.
That's... See. that's what it...

1007
01:04:20.022 --> 01:04:21.923
That's where
she's exactly right.

1008
01:04:21.958 --> 01:04:23.287
Lucy? Dad...

1009
01:04:23.322 --> 01:04:25.190
Keep it all in-house.
keep it in the headspace.

1010
01:04:25.225 --> 01:04:26.389
What's the fucking point. eh?

1011
01:04:33.068 --> 01:04:34.430
I can see what
you're doing. Brian

1012
01:04:34.465 --> 01:04:35.871
and you took your cue from me.

1013
01:04:37.171 --> 01:04:39.039
And it's no good.
It's no good at all.

1014
01:04:39.976 --> 01:04:41.910
I shouldnae have done it
and you shouldnae be doing it.

1015
01:04:41.945 --> 01:04:43.978
All that. "I'm a tough guy"
bollocks.

1016
01:04:44.013 --> 01:04:46.244
Cos that's what it is.
Total bollocks.

1017
01:04:47.511 --> 01:04:49.544
There's naebody tough.
None of us.

1018
01:04:49.579 --> 01:04:52.250
No' me. No' you.
No' Arnie bloody...

1019
01:04:52.285 --> 01:04:53.383
Schwarzenegger.

1020
01:04:54.287 --> 01:04:55.451
Aye.

1021
01:05:03.065 --> 01:05:04.658
You remember how I told you
about my pal

1022
01:05:04.693 --> 01:05:07.661
who got shot by the IRA?
Shot and killed by the IRA?

1023
01:05:08.433 --> 01:05:09.663
Yeah.

1024
01:05:10.866 --> 01:05:12.633
And how I got promoted to
Lance Corporal cos he was dead.

1025
01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:15.537
Right after the funeral.

1026
01:05:16.012 --> 01:05:17.440
They even give me his callsign.

1027
01:05:20.082 --> 01:05:22.346
I didn't... I didn't know that.
- Aye. well. now you do.

1028
01:05:29.091 --> 01:05:31.025
I didnae even think about it.
I was 20 years old.

1029
01:05:31.753 --> 01:05:33.522
But see. later.
that gnawed at me.

1030
01:05:36.362 --> 01:05:37.592
It gnawed at me.

1031
01:05:38.496 --> 01:05:40.232
You know. his dying
and me just stepping up

1032
01:05:40.267 --> 01:05:42.366
and saying to the major.
"Aye. sure. gimme his stripes.

1033
01:05:42.401 --> 01:05:43.664
I'll take his callsign."

1034
01:05:45.107 --> 01:05:46.403
It's like I wiped him
off the record.

1035
01:05:46.438 --> 01:05:48.174
No thought about anything else.

1036
01:05:48.209 --> 01:05:50.143
"Just gotta get these
tapes sewed on." That was it.

1037
01:05:55.447 --> 01:05:56.952
But he found his way back in.

1038
01:05:59.649 --> 01:06:00.582
And rightly so.

1039
01:06:03.191 --> 01:06:05.521
There's never been a day
from that moment to this

1040
01:06:05.556 --> 01:06:08.161
that I havnae thought about him.
but did I tell anybody?

1041
01:06:09.329 --> 01:06:10.757
Dad--
- You know what it...

1042
01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:13.661
You know what it felt like?
It felt like...

1043
01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:19.106
It felt like I had
to live my life and his.

1044
01:06:20.043 --> 01:06:21.042
That's what it felt like.

1045
01:06:23.475 --> 01:06:26.014
That's what I meant when I said
the dead have questions for you.

1046
01:06:28.678 --> 01:06:30.249
You see. when you join the Army

1047
01:06:30.284 --> 01:06:31.646
you're part of
something massive.

1048
01:06:31.681 --> 01:06:33.252
You know.
"We're all in this together."

1049
01:06:33.287 --> 01:06:35.386
But see. when it comes
to the knocks you take. we're...

1050
01:06:35.586 --> 01:06:36.750
we're all a closed book.

1051
01:06:39.227 --> 01:06:40.391
OK.

1052
01:06:43.132 --> 01:06:44.791
I'm not a good example. Brian.

1053
01:06:45.530 --> 01:06:46.694
And that hurts me.

1054
01:06:48.368 --> 01:06:50.434
It hurts me to see you
following that example.

1055
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:56.209
OK. Come in now. Dad. Come on.

1056
01:06:56.244 --> 01:06:58.046
No. no. no.
I've said what I came to say.

1057
01:07:07.816 --> 01:07:09.552
I couldn't be
more proud of you. son!

1058
01:07:11.688 --> 01:07:13.193
I couldnae be more proud of you.

1059
01:07:15.890 --> 01:07:17.164
It's me I'm ashamed of.

1060
01:07:17.892 --> 01:07:19.529
For not saying it to you sooner.

1061
01:07:22.567 --> 01:07:25.535
I said to your mother. I said
I couldnae even contemplate...

1062
01:07:25.570 --> 01:07:27.438
Aye. sure. I served 23 years

1063
01:07:27.473 --> 01:07:29.770
but I cannae even contemplate
what my son went through.

1064
01:07:32.445 --> 01:07:33.741
I'm in awe of that.

1065
01:07:37.747 --> 01:07:39.219
I have no experience of that.

1066
01:07:43.753 --> 01:07:45.258
And that hurts. as a father.

1067
01:07:48.461 --> 01:07:50.428
I sent you places
I've never been.

1068
01:07:58.801 --> 01:07:59.833
You were there. Dad.

1069
01:08:04.246 --> 01:08:05.278
You were there.

1070
01:08:20.328 --> 01:08:21.228
Oh. no!

1071
01:08:22.759 --> 01:08:24.462
- Babe.

1072
01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:25.859
What did you say to him?

1073
01:08:29.502 --> 01:08:31.469
I said he should tell you
what was on his mind.

1074
01:08:33.671 --> 01:08:34.868
And did he?
- Yeah.

1075
01:08:36.410 --> 01:08:38.212
Well. that's a good start then.
isn't it?

1076
01:08:38.247 --> 01:08:39.114
Yeah.

1077
01:08:42.614 --> 01:08:43.679
Alright. Bailey boy.

1078
01:08:44.418 --> 01:08:46.781
You beat your mum.
Can you beat your dad?

1079
01:08:48.554 --> 01:08:49.883
That was a good shot.

1080
01:08:49.918 --> 01:08:50.884
And again.

1081
01:08:51.491 --> 01:08:53.755
Oh-ho-ho. Oh!

1082
01:09:02.832 --> 01:09:04.832
Dad!

1083
01:09:08.409 --> 01:09:09.573
Bastard.

1084
01:09:24.018 --> 01:09:26.260
:
A public inquiry opens today

1085
01:09:26.295 --> 01:09:27.921
into some of the
most serious allegations

1086
01:09:27.956 --> 01:09:29.725
to have emerged
from the Iraq war.

1087
01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:31.925
It'll examine claims
that British troops

1088
01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:33.729
murdered up to 20 Iraqis

1089
01:09:33.764 --> 01:09:35.731
following a gun battle in 2004

1090
01:09:36.371 --> 01:09:38.404
and that nine detainees
were mistreated.

1091
01:09:38.439 --> 01:09:39.768
:
The inquiry is expected

1092
01:09:39.803 --> 01:09:40.967
to last for around a year.

1093
01:09:41.002 --> 01:09:42.804
Stop. please. sir.
Thank you.

1094
01:09:42.839 --> 01:09:44.806
Just a few last-minute thoughts.

1095
01:09:45.413 --> 01:09:48.777
Oh. Even more last-minute
than your 2am email?

1096
01:09:49.043 --> 01:09:51.681
The inquiry's terms of
reference are as follows

1097
01:09:51.716 --> 01:09:55.652
and I quote: "To investigate
and report on the allegations

1098
01:09:55.687 --> 01:09:59.293
made by the claimants
against British soldiers.

1099
01:09:59.328 --> 01:10:01.724
It is also necessary to examine

1100
01:10:02.331 --> 01:10:04.925
the broad circumstances
of the battle. the conduct

1101
01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:07.730
and the actions of the soldiers
and Iraqis involved

1102
01:10:07.765 --> 01:10:09.963
and the manner
and cause of death.

1103
01:10:09.998 --> 01:10:12.768
: Why is this
inquiry taking place?

1104
01:10:12.803 --> 01:10:15.903
This is a legitimate question
for all participants to ask

1105
01:10:15.938 --> 01:10:17.410
in light of the public expense

1106
01:10:17.643 --> 01:10:19.610
and resources
inevitably involved.

1107
01:10:20.976 --> 01:10:22.448
There is a clear answer

1108
01:10:22.483 --> 01:10:24.912
and that is because
of the credible allegations

1109
01:10:24.947 --> 01:10:28.223
of unlawful killing by British
soldiers of Iraqi civilians...

1110
01:10:28.489 --> 01:10:29.653
Tank chaser.

1111
01:10:31.624 --> 01:10:33.261
You care to repeat that?

1112
01:10:33.296 --> 01:10:34.856
Why do you hate us so much.
Mr Shiner?

1113
01:10:36.893 --> 01:10:38.662
I've represented more soldiers

1114
01:10:38.697 --> 01:10:40.301
than any other lawyer
in the country.

1115
01:10:40.336 --> 01:10:42.028
:
Disaffected soldiers. maybe.

1116
01:10:42.063 --> 01:10:44.833
Is there any other kind.
really? In the end?

1117
01:10:53.943 --> 01:10:55.910
: A boy at school
says you're a murderer.

1118
01:10:56.814 --> 01:10:58.418
And that's what's upsetting you?

1119
01:10:58.651 --> 01:10:59.749
That is upsetting.

1120
01:11:01.423 --> 01:11:02.752
And what'd you say?

1121
01:11:02.952 --> 01:11:04.358
He didn't say it to me.

1122
01:11:05.394 --> 01:11:06.459
He just said it.

1123
01:11:06.494 --> 01:11:08.395
Well. he must've
said it to somebody.

1124
01:11:16.031 --> 01:11:17.701
Come here. little man.

1125
01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:21.837
Say you're not.

1126
01:11:23.071 --> 01:11:24.807
Not what?
- Dad.

1127
01:11:25.909 --> 01:11:26.941
Bailey...

1128
01:11:28.813 --> 01:11:30.549
do I look like a murderer
to you?

1129
01:11:33.587 --> 01:11:34.421
Hm?

1130
01:11:35.083 --> 01:11:36.555
Come on. Get to bed.

1131
01:11:40.462 --> 01:11:41.725
Right. goodnight.

1132
01:11:53.068 --> 01:11:55.541
Did you forget your kecks?

1133
01:11:55.576 --> 01:11:56.674
Is that a problem?

1134
01:12:02.748 --> 01:12:03.879
You OK?

1135
01:12:05.553 --> 01:12:06.552
Yeah. I'm OK.

1136
01:12:08.754 --> 01:12:10.017
Sure you don't want me to come?

1137
01:12:10.558 --> 01:12:11.392
Yeah.

1138
01:12:12.186 --> 01:12:13.658
Yeah. no. I'll be fine.

1139
01:12:14.859 --> 01:12:15.990
I'll be thinking about you.

1140
01:12:20.733 --> 01:12:23.503
Babe. I'm taking Bailey
to school before I go to London.

1141
01:12:24.539 --> 01:12:25.604
OK.

1142
01:12:31.579 --> 01:12:32.809
Cheers.

1143
01:12:36.881 --> 01:12:38.782
Yo. let's get a move on.

1144
01:12:40.082 --> 01:12:42.984
Hey. you be good for your mum
now. little man. Yeah?

1145
01:12:43.019 --> 01:12:45.492
And you be good for me too.

1146
01:12:45.527 --> 01:12:47.692
Yeah. I'll be as
good as gold. babe.

1147
01:12:49.190 --> 01:12:50.464
Yo.

1148
01:12:52.831 --> 01:12:55.634
Love you. Have a good day.
- Thanks.

1149
01:13:01.576 --> 01:13:02.674
So...

1150
01:13:03.777 --> 01:13:06.106
someone at school said
that I was a murderer. yeah?

1151
01:13:09.012 --> 01:13:10.583
Do you think
they'd say that to my face?

1152
01:13:11.619 --> 01:13:13.520
Huh? Why not?

1153
01:13:14.688 --> 01:13:16.116
Cos you're bigger than them.
- Yeah?

1154
01:13:16.987 --> 01:13:19.757
And who's bigger? Them or you?

1155
01:13:20.661 --> 01:13:21.759
Them.

1156
01:13:21.794 --> 01:13:22.892
Yeah.

1157
01:13:24.962 --> 01:13:25.994
Don't come to school. Dad.

1158
01:13:28.768 --> 01:13:30.064
Hey. Come here.

1159
01:13:33.003 --> 01:13:34.101
Look...

1160
01:13:35.544 --> 01:13:36.840
for the record. Bailey...

1161
01:13:38.745 --> 01:13:39.909
I did kill people.

1162
01:13:40.945 --> 01:13:43.077
In Iraq... in a battle.

1163
01:13:45.279 --> 01:13:46.652
But I'm a soldier

1164
01:13:47.556 --> 01:13:49.490
and sometimes.
that's what soldiers have to do.

1165
01:13:54.123 --> 01:13:55.188
What do you think about that?

1166
01:14:04.001 --> 01:14:05.099
OK.

1167
01:14:07.906 --> 01:14:12.139
There's a difference between
that and being a murderer.

1168
01:14:13.307 --> 01:14:14.548
What is it?

1169
01:14:16.849 --> 01:14:19.047
That's what I'm going
to London today to talk about.

1170
01:14:38.134 --> 01:14:39.474
Who's up today?

1171
01:14:40.103 --> 01:14:42.169
Brian Wood and...

1172
01:14:42.776 --> 01:14:43.841
Chris Broome.

1173
01:14:48.782 --> 01:14:50.045
What's that?

1174
01:14:58.924 --> 01:15:00.627
Who sent this?

1175
01:15:00.926 --> 01:15:03.960
The inquiry wanted an audit
of evidence for disclosure

1176
01:15:03.995 --> 01:15:07.293
from all the different teams.
This just turned up.

1177
01:15:07.328 --> 01:15:10.670
Turned up? From where?
From our side?

1178
01:15:10.705 --> 01:15:12.298
Maybe it was at the
bottom of a pile somewhere.

1179
01:15:15.578 --> 01:15:17.138
So the local warlord

1180
01:15:17.778 --> 01:15:20.680
lists all Iraqi dead
and detainees as his soldiers.

1181
01:15:21.045 --> 01:15:22.176
Everyone there on the day.

1182
01:15:25.346 --> 01:15:26.554
Shit.

1183
01:15:29.889 --> 01:15:32.021
If they were soldiers.
not farmers

1184
01:15:32.056 --> 01:15:33.924
the inquiry won't believe
anything else we say.

1185
01:15:35.092 --> 01:15:36.564
Why didn't we know about this?

1186
01:15:37.864 --> 01:15:39.765
We should have known about this!

1187
01:15:42.396 --> 01:15:43.263
Phil!

1188
01:15:48.776 --> 01:15:50.171
For all we know. it's...

1189
01:15:50.844 --> 01:15:52.811
it's complete bullshit. It's...

1190
01:15:53.913 --> 01:15:58.179
propaganda put about
by local Iraqi militia.

1191
01:15:59.655 --> 01:16:01.688
Turning them into martyrs.
It's...

1192
01:16:01.723 --> 01:16:03.283
The judge will
throw it out as irrelevant.

1193
01:16:03.318 --> 01:16:05.384
Will he?
How can you know that?

1194
01:16:05.419 --> 01:16:08.024
Cos Patrick will point them
in that direction. It's obvious.

1195
01:16:08.059 --> 01:16:10.862
You told me a case is only as
strong as its weakest evidence.

1196
01:16:10.897 --> 01:16:12.732
This casts doubt
on our witnesses!

1197
01:16:12.767 --> 01:16:14.360
I'll tell you
what's not in doubt.

1198
01:16:14.395 --> 01:16:16.362
They're a bunch
of lads with Kalashnikovs

1199
01:16:16.397 --> 01:16:18.870
that British troops
threw 13.000 rounds at.

1200
01:16:19.136 --> 01:16:20.641
That's what they are.

1201
01:16:20.676 --> 01:16:23.369
Lads at breakfast.
soldiers at teatime

1202
01:16:23.404 --> 01:16:25.844
lads again by bedtime.
if they lasted that long.

1203
01:16:26.275 --> 01:16:27.681
I'll brief Patrick.

1204
01:16:57.273 --> 01:16:58.712
What did they say?
- About the list?

1205
01:16:58.747 --> 01:16:59.438
What do you think?

1206
01:16:59.473 --> 01:17:01.110
They're taking it at face value?

1207
01:17:01.145 --> 01:17:03.178
Inquiry's already underwhelmed
by some of our witnesses

1208
01:17:03.213 --> 01:17:05.719
and it's on headed paper.
it's got a bloody rubber stamp.

1209
01:17:05.754 --> 01:17:08.216
It's probably just a boast.
not a fucking employment record.

1210
01:17:08.251 --> 01:17:10.889
Our witnesses have most probably
never even seen that list.

1211
01:17:10.924 --> 01:17:12.088
Yeah. shame we hadn't either.

1212
01:17:12.123 --> 01:17:13.958
It makes no difference.

1213
01:17:14.191 --> 01:17:16.928
It makes no difference at all
to the human rights issues.

1214
01:17:16.963 --> 01:17:18.897
It makes no difference
to what's important.

1215
01:17:18.932 --> 01:17:21.262
It's one piece of evidence
amongst a mountain of stuff.

1216
01:17:21.297 --> 01:17:22.703
It's not one piece.
though. is it?

1217
01:17:22.738 --> 01:17:24.331
It's part of a picture
that's emerging.

1218
01:17:24.366 --> 01:17:26.333
A picture that's not
the one you wanted to see.

1219
01:17:26.368 --> 01:17:29.171
It doesn't mean that terrible
things didn't happen that day

1220
01:17:29.206 --> 01:17:31.140
or that everything
our witnesses say is lies.

1221
01:17:31.175 --> 01:17:32.911
I know that. Phil.

1222
01:17:32.946 --> 01:17:35.111
But things like this.
you start to look at best naive

1223
01:17:35.146 --> 01:17:36.343
and at worst mendacious.

1224
01:17:37.786 --> 01:17:38.983
It came out of nowhere!

1225
01:17:39.018 --> 01:17:41.051
It came out of
somewhere you didn't look.

1226
01:18:46.855 --> 01:18:48.789
: Some evidence
has just come to light.

1227
01:18:49.924 --> 01:18:52.485
An official list
from the local Iraqi militia.

1228
01:18:53.422 --> 01:18:56.423
It clearly identifies all
the dead and all the detainees

1229
01:18:57.525 --> 01:18:59.393
as members of their armed group.

1230
01:19:00.968 --> 01:19:03.265
It looks like they
weren't just farmers. Brian.

1231
01:19:31.394 --> 01:19:33.064
You know what my
vehicle commander said?

1232
01:19:34.595 --> 01:19:37.068
At Danny Boy. when it was over?

1233
01:19:39.842 --> 01:19:41.468
He said he didn't
see the elders there.

1234
01:19:45.045 --> 01:19:46.341
Didn't see the ones in charge

1235
01:19:46.376 --> 01:19:48.442
who'd sent these kids out
in flip-flops to fight us.

1236
01:19:52.052 --> 01:19:53.282
Then sent them
halfway round the world

1237
01:19:53.317 --> 01:19:54.580
to fight us again in court.

1238
01:19:56.386 --> 01:19:58.122
Where are they
when shit hits the fan?

1239
01:20:00.489 --> 01:20:01.829
Well. quite.

1240
01:20:01.864 --> 01:20:04.062
If these people wanna go
and make war a crime

1241
01:20:04.097 --> 01:20:05.624
that's up to them

1242
01:20:05.659 --> 01:20:07.560
but I didn't do anything
to be ashamed of in Al Amara.

1243
01:20:09.135 --> 01:20:10.431
I fought for my country.

1244
01:20:12.105 --> 01:20:13.401
And I'm proud of what I did.

1245
01:20:23.116 --> 01:20:24.819
But not doing
anything to be ashamed of...

1246
01:20:27.186 --> 01:20:29.021
doesn't stop me
from feeling ashamed.

1247
01:21:17.302 --> 01:21:19.335
-

1248
01:21:19.370 --> 01:21:21.139
Who's that?

1249
01:21:21.174 --> 01:21:22.371
: How does it feel
to be accused of war crimes?

1250
01:21:22.406 --> 01:21:23.504
:
Brian Wood.

1251
01:22:01.049 --> 01:22:04.545
leaves are falling...

1252
01:22:07.418 --> 01:22:08.648
Corporal Wood?

1253
01:22:53.266 --> 01:22:54.397
Who's going to be there?

1254
01:22:55.829 --> 01:22:57.202
Lawyers. mainly.

1255
01:22:57.237 --> 01:22:58.302
Um...

1256
01:22:59.107 --> 01:23:00.370
Some soldiers.

1257
01:23:00.768 --> 01:23:01.976
People from Iraq.

1258
01:23:03.111 --> 01:23:05.045
Because you killed people?

1259
01:23:05.278 --> 01:23:08.114
Well. not just me. There was
a lot of people killed. mate.

1260
01:23:10.811 --> 01:23:13.680
And when you've talked about it.
then what?

1261
01:23:14.749 --> 01:23:18.553
Well. when I've finished
talking about it. then. er...

1262
01:23:22.493 --> 01:23:24.196
then I've finished
with being a soldier.
