00:00:54.345 --> 00:00:55.889
close it out on
an arrest report.

16

I can keep it for you.

Gonna pass out the

Would you mind helping me
a little bit here. please?

36
00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:29.542
All right. everybody. welcome

Design Fundamentals.

38
00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:34.255
We're gonna be meeting
every Thursday.

39
00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:36.174
This is an 11 week course.

40
00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:40.762
You get three credits
and I'm your instructor.

41
00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:42.347
My name is Larry Dexter.

42
00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:45.975
The course description. this is.

43
00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:48.353
take a look at your syllabus
here and follow along.

44
00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:51.898
It's an introduction to the
basic principles of design

45
00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:54.234
using a variety of materials.

46
00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:56.819
- That's where it all began.

47
00:03:57.695 --> 00:03:59.197
- What do you mean?

48
00:03:59.197 --> 00:04:02.242
That's when you decided
to become a street artist?

49
00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:08.706
- [Artist] I mean. when I.

50
00:04:08.706 --> 00:04:10.541
you know. where it
began was where I wanted

51
00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:12.210
to follow my dream
and go to college

52
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.754
to the study the art
that I wanted to pursue.

53
00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:18.758
- So you would say that college
and studying art in school

54
00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:20.843
was the first step
that started it all.

55
00:04:22.136 --> 00:04:23.638
- You know. at the time.
everyone just wanted me

56
00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:26.140
to make them happy
and try to fit in

57
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.395
but when I filed the
divorce and cut everyone off

58
00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:32.772
and went to school for my
art. I felt like at that point

59
00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:35.066
I was really finally
becoming an artist

60
00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:37.318
or at least taking
the path of one.

61
00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:40.613
- So when you decided
to follow your dreams.

62
00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:43.408
as an artist. how'd
that change your life?

63
00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:51.416
- You know. my dad used
to take me to school.

64
00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:53.835
Elementary. like
fourth or fifth grade.

65
00:04:56.504 --> 00:04:58.965
I remember on the way
I'd always tell him

66
00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:03.136
what's going on at our
class for today and

67
00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:05.430
we were doing something.
drawing horse hair

68
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.349
or goldfish scales. something.

69
00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:09.267
and I remember
telling him about it

70
00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:11.519
and he was like. Just stop!

71
00:05:15.273 --> 00:05:16.941
He was trying to tell me that

72
00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:20.945
my dream of being an artist

73
00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:25.033
was fun but it wasn't realistic.

74
00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:27.535
What I needed to
do was find a job

75
00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:32.373
or build up a career that
makes good money to be happy.

76
00:05:33.207 --> 00:05:34.375
And I said. but Dad.

77
00:05:34.375 --> 00:05:36.085
obviously money doesn't
make anyone happy.

78
00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:41.591
He said that it's not the
money that makes people happy.

79
00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:46.971
it's the stability from the
money that makes people happy.

80
00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:52.518
I remember getting
out of the car

81
00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:55.313
and being so upset
at him. you know.

82
00:05:55.313 --> 00:05:58.649
Just feeling so let down
and not acknowledged.

83
00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:02.153
I decided I wasn't gonna
let this ruin my day.

84
00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:03.363
I wanted to turn around

85
00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:04.947
and try to wave bye
to him. you know.

86
00:06:04.947 --> 00:06:06.199
And by the time I had done that.

87
00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.159
he was already halfway
down the street.

88
00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:14.040
I tried to find
financial stability.

89
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.084
I tried to find someone
I was happy with.

90
00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:19.837
But the moment I...

91
00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:25.176
The moment I really
decided to follow my dream.

92
00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:29.639
everyone treated me
like I was a bad person.

93
00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.350
(birds chirping)

94
00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:53.913
What's this?

95
00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:55.123
- Our divorce papers.

96
00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:57.417
Conveniently you decided
to not have a phone.

97
00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:58.876
- Why. just because I don't
have a phone I'm given this?

98
00:06:58.876 --> 00:07:00.378
- No but it's responsible.

99
00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:02.004
You already missed our first
two mediation appointments

100
00:07:02.004 --> 00:07:03.798
but I had to pay for your fees

101
00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:05.383
and your dad keeps
calling me. bothering me.

102
00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:06.843
asking me where you're at.

103
00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:08.594
So I just gave him your phone
number and your address.

104
00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:10.179
- You gave him my address?

105
00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:11.764
- Yeah because I don't
wanna deal with it anymore.

106
00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:12.598
He's your dad.

107
00:07:14.058 --> 00:07:16.477
- You know what. I really
don't wanna talk about this.

108
00:07:16.477 --> 00:07:18.020
- You know what. we're
not done talking about it

109
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.231
until you understand that
I need these papers signed

110
00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:23.109
so I can move on with my
life. do you get that?

111
00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:24.610
- Yeah. I get it.

112
00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.612
But don't you get that I'm
trying to go to school right now

113
00:07:26.612 --> 00:07:29.449
to make a living and to
make something of myself?

114
00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:32.535
I'm happy doing and
pursuing what I love.

115
00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:36.164
I'm not a coward anymore
afraid to chase it. okay?

116
00:07:36.164 --> 00:07:38.749
I was miserable working
for you and your dad.

117
00:07:38.749 --> 00:07:40.084
I really was.

118
00:07:40.084 --> 00:07:42.253
But I'm happy now
doing what I love

119
00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:44.422
and I'm probably gonna
make a living out of it.

120
00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:47.633
Doesn't that even make you
the least bit proud of me?

121
00:07:47.633 --> 00:07:48.885
- I mean.

122
00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:50.428
I feel like I was the
best thing you ever had

123
00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:52.638
and you lost that and you
didn't work towards that.

124
00:07:52.638 --> 00:07:55.308
So I hope you have a great time
with the rest of your life.

125
00:08:11.782 --> 00:08:14.785
(traffic whooshing)

126
00:08:15.953 --> 00:08:18.331
- Jesus Christ. man. it
took you long enough.

127
00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:20.750
- I know.
- Come on. let's go!

128
00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:24.295
We've got shit to do today. man.

129
00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:30.426
- This is the third time
you guys have been late

130
00:08:30.426 --> 00:08:31.677
in the past two weeks.

131
00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:32.678
- Not me. him!

132
00:08:34.138 --> 00:08:35.473
- I don't have money for a car.

133
00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:36.682
I have to take the Light Rail.

134
00:08:36.682 --> 00:08:38.601
- Ronnie. Zach has
been doing you a favor

135
00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:41.020
by picking you up at Light Rail.

136
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.522
- Well. I'm sorry.

137
00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:43.856
I took the Light Rail
this morning. I was late.

138
00:08:43.856 --> 00:08:45.441
It's not even my fault. okay?

139
00:08:45.441 --> 00:08:47.026
I can't control what the
train conductor's gonna do

140
00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:48.486
or how fast he goes.

141
00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:51.656
- You've got two more stops
added to today's route.

142
00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:54.575
You must have them done
by 6 p.m.. understand?

143
00:08:54.575 --> 00:08:55.826
- [Zach] I got you.

144
00:08:55.826 --> 00:08:56.661
- Really?

145
00:08:57.745 --> 00:08:59.539
- I could sue you for that.

146
00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:00.373
- Oh.
(man laughing)

147
00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:02.208
With what money. Ronnie?

148
00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:03.459
(Zach chuckling)

149
00:09:03.459 --> 00:09:04.293
- Dumbass.

150
00:09:04.293 --> 00:09:05.127
Let's go.

151
00:09:07.713 --> 00:09:08.548
You know. man...

152
00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:13.219
Your legs must be snails
or something. man.

153
00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:15.012
You're slow as
fuck all the time.

154
00:09:16.013 --> 00:09:17.515
(Ronnie chuckling)

155
00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:18.391
- Faster than you.

156
00:09:19.934 --> 00:09:20.768
- Yeah. maybe.

157
00:09:20.768 --> 00:09:21.602
Probably.

158
00:09:21.602 --> 00:09:23.729
(Zach laughing)

159
00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:24.564
Fuck.

160
00:09:28.859 --> 00:09:31.821
(lighter clicking)

161
00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:41.205
I know you're probably
just gonna say no

162
00:09:41.205 --> 00:09:43.332
but do you wanna take
a drag off of this?

163
00:09:43.332 --> 00:09:44.208
- No. I'm okay.

164
00:09:48.212 --> 00:09:49.630
I'm really sorry about
upsetting your dad

165
00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.173
back at the warehouse.

166
00:09:52.049 --> 00:09:53.259
You know that wasn't my intent.

167
00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:54.969
I just was late
from the Light Rail.

168
00:09:54.969 --> 00:09:56.137
You know I can't control that.

169
00:09:56.137 --> 00:09:57.305
- It's just...

170
00:09:58.222 --> 00:09:59.807
If we fuck this up.

171
00:09:59.807 --> 00:10:01.601
if I lose this job.
I'm fucked. man.

172
00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:03.561
I need this money. you know?

173
00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:10.401
- Well. I kinda need the job
pretty bad too. you know?

174
00:10:10.401 --> 00:10:12.528
Despite everything and me
being late. I do need it

175
00:10:12.528 --> 00:10:16.157
because. you know. I've gotta
keep up living at my motel

176
00:10:16.157 --> 00:10:18.409
and going to art school.

177
00:10:18.409 --> 00:10:20.703
- Why're you going to
college for art anyway. man?

178
00:10:20.703 --> 00:10:21.912
It's not like you're gonna be

179
00:10:21.912 --> 00:10:23.205
rolling in dough
when you graduate.

180
00:10:24.248 --> 00:10:25.374
- I can.

181
00:10:25.374 --> 00:10:26.751
I mean--
- Yeah?

182
00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:28.919
- Yeah. like I could
definitely do that. you know?

183
00:10:28.919 --> 00:10:30.212
I mean. there's just
so many different ways

184
00:10:30.212 --> 00:10:31.964
that you can draw or
do your art. you know?

185
00:10:31.964 --> 00:10:33.507
- [Zach] How?

186
00:10:33.507 --> 00:10:35.217
- I mean. like. for example
like one's about comic books.

187
00:10:35.217 --> 00:10:38.596
So you learn how to do
paneling and symbolism

188
00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:41.098
and everything in
close up. so...

189
00:10:41.098 --> 00:10:44.602
I just thought. you know.
why not just study up on some

190
00:10:44.602 --> 00:10:47.521
of this art and see how
I can change my own. so.

191
00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:49.106
- Whatever makes you happy. dog.

192
00:10:50.733 --> 00:10:52.068
Me.

193
00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:53.694
I'm trying to get this new thing

194
00:10:53.694 --> 00:10:55.613
at a postal service.

195
00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:57.782
It's way better than
a newspaper place.

196
00:10:57.782 --> 00:10:59.950
My dad says he has an in

197
00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:02.620
but I gotta go for an
interview and a drug test.

198
00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.164
- Maybe if you stopped
smoking so much weed

199
00:11:05.164 --> 00:11:06.957
in general. or
smoking. you know.

200
00:11:06.957 --> 00:11:08.626
maybe you can get
it a lot sooner.

201
00:11:10.461 --> 00:11:13.172
- [Zach] Yeah. about that.

202
00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:15.007
(Zach and Ronnie laughing)

203
00:11:15.007 --> 00:11:15.841
Whatever. man.

204
00:11:18.135 --> 00:11:19.053
- [Ronnie] But.
hey. I still think

205
00:11:19.053 --> 00:11:20.638
you'll get the job regardless.

206
00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:22.431
- [Zach] Thanks. man.

207
00:11:22.431 --> 00:11:25.601
(upbeat guitar music)

208
00:11:51.669 --> 00:11:52.503
(Ronnie groaning)

209
00:11:52.503 --> 00:11:53.671
(Zach laughing)

210
00:11:53.671 --> 00:11:54.839
- You asshole!

211
00:11:58.926 --> 00:12:02.096
(upbeat guitar music)

212
00:12:02.096 --> 00:12:04.890
- [Zach] That's the one you
already threw at. dumbass!

213
00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:08.686
(Zach and Ronnie chattering)

214
00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:24.243
- So. you said that you were
studying your college art books

215
00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:25.953
while you were on
your newspaper route.

216
00:12:25.953 --> 00:12:28.956
Now. I wanna know is
what was the point

217
00:12:28.956 --> 00:12:30.666
at which you
actually figured out

218
00:12:30.666 --> 00:12:32.585
what kind of art you
wanted to create?

219
00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:36.213
Or when was it that you
figured out the kind of medium

220
00:12:36.213 --> 00:12:38.758
that you wanted to explore
and give me the details.

221
00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:44.930
- I mean. I like to sketch.

222
00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:47.266
I definitely like to paint.

223
00:12:49.935 --> 00:12:51.687
I reference Picasso a lot.

224
00:12:51.687 --> 00:12:54.732
I like to study and use
a lot of his pieces.

225
00:12:56.066 --> 00:12:57.234
(Ronnie sighing)

226
00:12:57.234 --> 00:12:58.527
You know. at the time.
I really just had

227
00:12:58.527 --> 00:13:01.322
this tiny little laptop
that I would just do

228
00:13:01.322 --> 00:13:04.241
all my color and designings
for my projects. you know?

229
00:13:05.576 --> 00:13:07.369
Take it to Walgreens
and have them print it

230
00:13:07.369 --> 00:13:08.746
on paper and poster.

231
00:13:10.372 --> 00:13:13.417
And I actually got in
a lot of trouble for it

232
00:13:13.417 --> 00:13:15.252
with my college professor.

233
00:13:15.252 --> 00:13:17.087
Hi. my name's Ronnie Carlone

234
00:13:17.087 --> 00:13:19.882
and I'm doing the
Cyanotype Process.

235
00:13:22.384 --> 00:13:26.555
Sir John Herschel introduced
the Cyanotype Process in 1842.

236
00:13:28.432 --> 00:13:31.977
It was adopted by amateur
photographers and draftsman

237
00:13:31.977 --> 00:13:34.730
as it provided a simple
and inexpensive way

238
00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:39.401
to reproduce negative
and/or drawings.

239
00:13:40.444 --> 00:13:42.321
Scientists.
particularly botanists.

240
00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:45.533
also loved this process
for its ability to render

241
00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:48.077
intricate details
of plant structures

242
00:13:48.077 --> 00:13:51.330
in a scientifically pure way.

243
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:52.456
Um...

244
00:13:52.456 --> 00:13:54.959
(Ronnie coughing)

245
00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:58.045
The skeleton with a lit
cigarette in its mouth

246
00:13:58.045 --> 00:14:00.464
is a juvenile joke

247
00:14:00.464 --> 00:14:04.593
because Van Gogh
painted it in early 1886

248
00:14:04.593 --> 00:14:08.138
while studying at
the art academy

249
00:14:08.138 --> 00:14:09.473
in Antwerp.

250
00:14:10.891 --> 00:14:14.311
The painting shows that he
had a good command of anatomy

251
00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:19.525
as well as his letters
and anecdotes from others

252
00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:22.528
record that he sparred
with his drawing

253
00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:25.406
and painting teachers
and was scornful

254
00:14:25.406 --> 00:14:28.158
of conservative
academic practice.

255
00:14:29.451 --> 00:14:30.744
His time at the academy

256
00:14:32.663 --> 00:14:35.666
lasted only weeks.

257
00:14:35.666 --> 00:14:38.711
He felt he was learning
nothing and later proclaimed

258
00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:43.048
academic training damned boring.

259
00:14:43.048 --> 00:14:45.759
- Ronnie. unfortunately we're
all out of time for today.

260
00:14:45.759 --> 00:14:47.595
I'm gonna have to
stop you right there

261
00:14:47.595 --> 00:14:50.431
and we're gonna pick up with
the next set of presentations

262
00:14:50.431 --> 00:14:53.142
at the beginning of next week.

263
00:14:53.142 --> 00:14:55.978
Read chapters six and seven.

264
00:14:55.978 --> 00:14:59.273
Please email me
your chapter reviews

265
00:14:59.273 --> 00:15:01.150
prior to next's week's class.

266
00:15:04.528 --> 00:15:05.988
Thank you. everybody.

267
00:15:14.955 --> 00:15:17.499
Hey. Ronnie. your art
piece is cool and all

268
00:15:17.499 --> 00:15:20.210
but that was not
really the assignment.

269
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:24.757
The assignment was to recreate
a piece of art in any medium.

270
00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:28.344
photography. design and
present it to the class.

271
00:15:29.386 --> 00:15:30.554
- Mr. Dexter. that's what I did.

272
00:15:30.554 --> 00:15:31.722
I did the Cyanotype Process.

273
00:15:32.848 --> 00:15:34.350
It's the same printing
and everything.

274
00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:37.436
And I made it my own. I used
a medium just like you asked.

275
00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:38.604
So I don't understand.

276
00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:40.064
- Ronnie. what I
really want you to do

277
00:15:40.064 --> 00:15:43.108
is focus on your portfolio

278
00:15:43.108 --> 00:15:46.612
so you can get a paying gig
when you get out of this class.

279
00:15:48.072 --> 00:15:51.283
No one's gonna pay you for a
cyan blue piece of artwork.

280
00:15:52.993 --> 00:15:54.078
- Okay but...

281
00:15:55.245 --> 00:15:58.290
I don't care about
getting paid for it.

282
00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:00.876
I just wanna be able to get
good at what I wanna do.

283
00:16:00.876 --> 00:16:02.086
So if I wanna do this again.

284
00:16:02.086 --> 00:16:03.504
I wanna know that I
can do it properly

285
00:16:03.504 --> 00:16:05.255
and better than I
did it this time.

286
00:16:06.382 --> 00:16:07.800
I mean. I just don't
understand why you think

287
00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.386
it has to be something
people will pay for.

288
00:16:10.386 --> 00:16:12.638
That shouldn't be the standard
of what you're teaching.

289
00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:13.889
in my opinion.

290
00:16:13.889 --> 00:16:16.558
- Well I want you
to get a paying gig

291
00:16:16.558 --> 00:16:18.227
when you get out of college.

292
00:16:18.227 --> 00:16:20.437
You'll get a passing
grade this assignment

293
00:16:20.437 --> 00:16:22.898
but I really want you to focus

294
00:16:22.898 --> 00:16:25.025
and come back
stronger next time.

295
00:16:25.025 --> 00:16:28.654
Focus on your portfolio
to get a paying gig.

296
00:16:29.947 --> 00:16:31.782
- All right.

297
00:16:31.782 --> 00:16:32.783
All right. whatever.

298
00:16:34.201 --> 00:16:35.869
- [Dexter] See you
next week. Ronnie.

299
00:16:35.869 --> 00:16:37.830
- [Ronnie] Yeah. whatever.

300
00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:38.956
- [TV Narrator]
"The Potato Eaters"

301
00:16:38.956 --> 00:16:42.292
is his first
knockout masterpiece.

302
00:16:43.544 --> 00:16:44.878
It's a resume

303
00:16:44.878 --> 00:16:47.756
of everything he's felt
and thought up till now.

304
00:16:47.756 --> 00:16:51.051
Everything that would make
him a revolutionary artist

305
00:16:51.051 --> 00:16:52.803
is already here.

306
00:16:52.803 --> 00:16:56.432
(pleasant television music)

307
00:16:58.142 --> 00:17:00.644
The dark. thick color was chosen

308
00:17:00.644 --> 00:17:03.605
not just for
pictorial effect but.

309
00:17:03.605 --> 00:17:07.568
you might say. philosophically
to say something.

310
00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:12.865
And that something isn't
meant to be charmingly rustic.

311
00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:15.117
I mean. how brown can you get?

312
00:17:15.117 --> 00:17:19.371
This is manure brown. the
gray brown as he explained

313
00:17:19.371 --> 00:17:22.666
of dusty spuds before
they've been rinsed.

314
00:17:24.251 --> 00:17:26.712
Lost in total identification.

315
00:17:26.712 --> 00:17:29.506
Van Gogh paints like clod.

316
00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:34.428
the heavy. loaded brush
doing its own manual labor.

317
00:17:36.764 --> 00:17:41.226
The picture seems troweled
and dug rather than painted.

318
00:17:42.436 --> 00:17:45.647
The total union between
painter and subject.

319
00:17:47.524 --> 00:17:48.776
it's all in the hands.

320
00:17:48.776 --> 00:17:50.527
- I'm trying to
bring out the idea

321
00:17:50.527 --> 00:17:53.197
that these people
eating potatoes by the
light of their lamp

322
00:17:53.197 --> 00:17:54.948
have dug the earth with
the self same hands

323
00:17:54.948 --> 00:17:56.700
that they're putting
into the dish.

324
00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:57.868
Manual labor!

325
00:17:57.868 --> 00:18:00.496
(door knocking)
A meal honestly earned.

326
00:18:00.496 --> 00:18:03.373
Anyone who wants to paint
peasants looking namby-pamby

327
00:18:03.373 --> 00:18:04.583
had better shoot himself.

328
00:18:06.043 --> 00:18:08.128
It's almost as if he's--

329
00:18:08.128 --> 00:18:10.172
- [Man] What's going on?

330
00:18:10.172 --> 00:18:11.715
- [Ronnie] Nothing.

331
00:18:16.637 --> 00:18:17.846
- What the hell's going on?

332
00:18:17.846 --> 00:18:19.515
I've been calling
your phone every day.

333
00:18:19.515 --> 00:18:21.558
You don't answer your fucking
phone. now it's disconnected.

334
00:18:21.558 --> 00:18:22.935
- It's because I
don't have a phone.

335
00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:24.269
I only have a motel phone.

336
00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:27.064
You probably just called
when I wasn't here.

337
00:18:27.064 --> 00:18:28.482
- What're you doing?

338
00:18:28.482 --> 00:18:30.943
You're a smart kid.
you've always been smart.

339
00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:34.988
You had a good job but you
make some fucked up decisions.

340
00:18:34.988 --> 00:18:36.907
- What. I didn't wanna be
married to that bitch anymore.

341
00:18:36.907 --> 00:18:39.660
I'm going to school now and
I'm getting an education.

342
00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.245
I don't see what the problem is.

343
00:18:41.245 --> 00:18:42.538
I'm an artist.

344
00:18:42.538 --> 00:18:44.081
- Painting. drawing.

345
00:18:44.081 --> 00:18:44.998
- Yeah.
- Do you know how hard it is

346
00:18:44.998 --> 00:18:46.250
to sell paintings and art?

347
00:18:47.501 --> 00:18:48.627
How're you gonna

348
00:18:48.627 --> 00:18:49.837
make a living?
- It's not that hard.

349
00:18:49.837 --> 00:18:51.046
- How're you gonna
put food on the table?

350
00:18:51.046 --> 00:18:51.964
- It's not that
hard if you're good

351
00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:53.006
and I'm trying to get good now.

352
00:18:55.175 --> 00:18:58.720
It'll probably get put on the
table when I turn 33 or 35.

353
00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.265
It'll take awhile but I
will get there. I know I am.

354
00:19:01.265 --> 00:19:04.017
- You had a good job. you
were making good money.

355
00:19:04.017 --> 00:19:05.394
That's how life works.

356
00:19:05.394 --> 00:19:07.479
You get married. you have kids.

357
00:19:07.479 --> 00:19:08.605
You build something.

358
00:19:08.605 --> 00:19:11.108
- Dad. I wasn't happy with her.

359
00:19:11.108 --> 00:19:13.694
She just wanted to
control me for her dad

360
00:19:13.694 --> 00:19:15.195
so he could just
use me at his work.

361
00:19:15.195 --> 00:19:18.115
I wouldn't have been anyone
special or meaningful.

362
00:19:18.115 --> 00:19:21.118
- I drove three hours
over here to talk to you

363
00:19:21.118 --> 00:19:23.704
and you look like you have
your fucking mind set on this.

364
00:19:23.704 --> 00:19:27.499
- I don't wanna work nine to
five like you at a warehouse

365
00:19:27.499 --> 00:19:29.293
working with the
same eight people.

366
00:19:29.293 --> 00:19:31.628
inspiring only the
same eight people.

367
00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:36.758
I want to inspire a hundred
people. thousands of people

368
00:19:36.758 --> 00:19:38.302
to think. oh wow.
he's doing something

369
00:19:38.302 --> 00:19:41.180
really impressive and creative.
I wonder if I could do that.

370
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.140
And then they give it a
shot and they be great at it

371
00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:45.225
or even better than
me. which is amazing.

372
00:19:47.352 --> 00:19:48.979
- I'm fed up with this shit.

373
00:19:48.979 --> 00:19:49.980
I'm tired of trying.

374
00:19:51.315 --> 00:19:53.317
- [Ronnie] Then stop
trying. I didn't ask you to.

375
00:19:57.321 --> 00:19:58.488
- Do what you want.

376
00:19:58.488 --> 00:20:00.032
At least get the hell
out of this place.

377
00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:02.117
Go fucking interact with people.

378
00:20:02.117 --> 00:20:03.368
Don't sit at a place like this

379
00:20:03.368 --> 00:20:04.870
all fucking night by yourself.

380
00:20:08.624 --> 00:20:10.626
Go do something with yourself.

381
00:20:31.813 --> 00:20:36.777
(Ronnie sighing)
(Camera beeping)

382
00:20:37.986 --> 00:20:39.738
- All my dad ever cared
about was a paycheck.

383
00:20:39.738 --> 00:20:40.614
My paycheck.

384
00:20:41.865 --> 00:20:43.909
Make sure that it
was big and stable

385
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:46.119
for everything I wanted
and needed. you know?

386
00:20:50.457 --> 00:20:51.708
I think.

387
00:20:52.709 --> 00:20:53.919
no.

388
00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:58.048
I know he only liked my
ex-wife and her father

389
00:20:58.048 --> 00:20:59.633
because they had a lot of money.

390
00:21:01.593 --> 00:21:03.303
You know. he offered
me a high paying job

391
00:21:03.303 --> 00:21:04.763
within his company and...

392
00:21:07.224 --> 00:21:09.643
You know. my dad and
school weren't anything

393
00:21:09.643 --> 00:21:11.353
what I thought
they were gonna be.

394
00:21:13.897 --> 00:21:15.941
(Ronnie sighing)

395
00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:18.360
The next day at work
I was so frustrated

396
00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.237
that I fucked up
my delivery route.

397
00:21:20.237 --> 00:21:22.906
(door knocking)

398
00:21:26.034 --> 00:21:26.868
Oh. hey.

399
00:21:26.868 --> 00:21:27.786
- Hey. what's up. dude?

400
00:21:28.954 --> 00:21:31.748
So. I kinda got a
favor to ask of you.

401
00:21:32.749 --> 00:21:33.583
So...

402
00:21:34.835 --> 00:21:38.088
I got the home bro
and I was hoping to

403
00:21:38.088 --> 00:21:39.965
spend some time with him today.

404
00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:43.093
Can you take the papers and

405
00:21:43.093 --> 00:21:44.261
do the delivery for me?

406
00:21:44.261 --> 00:21:48.015
I'll even give you the keys

407
00:21:48.015 --> 00:21:50.058
and you can take the car.

408
00:21:50.058 --> 00:21:52.519
These are the routes that
you'd have to hit today.

409
00:21:53.353 --> 00:21:54.146
All right?

410
00:21:55.772 --> 00:21:57.441
It's easy. we've done it before.

411
00:21:58.275 --> 00:21:59.109
- Okay.

412
00:21:59.109 --> 00:21:59.943
- You good?

413
00:21:59.943 --> 00:22:01.278
- Sure.

414
00:22:01.278 --> 00:22:02.195
- Thanks dude.

415
00:22:02.195 --> 00:22:03.697
I knew I can count on you.

416
00:22:03.697 --> 00:22:04.781
All right.

417
00:22:04.781 --> 00:22:08.285
(upbeat video game music)

418
00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:43.612
(faint video game music)

419
00:22:45.822 --> 00:22:48.617
(Ronnie groaning)

420
00:22:57.167 --> 00:22:59.711
(music muting)

421
00:23:17.979 --> 00:23:20.649
(door knocking)

422
00:23:23.276 --> 00:23:24.444
Hey. thanks again. bro.

423
00:23:25.529 --> 00:23:27.280
Yo. what's good. man?

424
00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.115
- Nothing.

425
00:23:28.115 --> 00:23:28.949
- Good.

426
00:23:28.949 --> 00:23:29.908
Yo. yesterday was fun.

427
00:23:29.908 --> 00:23:31.576
Thanks again for helping me out.

428
00:23:32.702 --> 00:23:34.538
You got my keys anywhere?

429
00:23:34.538 --> 00:23:35.747
We're running a little bit late

430
00:23:35.747 --> 00:23:38.834
but if we get going
right now we could get

431
00:23:38.834 --> 00:23:39.960
the day started.

432
00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:41.461
Oh. hold on a second. one sec.

433
00:23:42.963 --> 00:23:44.381
Hey. Dad. what's up?

434
00:23:44.381 --> 00:23:45.882
- [Dad] What the hell happened
yesterday with you guys?

435
00:23:45.882 --> 00:23:46.883
- What do you mean?

436
00:23:48.051 --> 00:23:50.512
- [Dad] Don't act
stupid with me. Zach.

437
00:23:50.512 --> 00:23:53.348
You guys missed half of
your route yesterday.

438
00:23:53.348 --> 00:23:56.393
Four different residential
areas had complaints.

439
00:23:56.393 --> 00:23:59.312
This isn't funny anymore. guys.

440
00:23:59.312 --> 00:24:01.314
I gave your routes to
different drivers today.

441
00:24:01.314 --> 00:24:03.483
- What. I'm sorry.
- That way we can pay people

442
00:24:03.483 --> 00:24:05.861
who are willing to do their job.

443
00:24:05.861 --> 00:24:09.239
I want you to take the day
and think about priorities

444
00:24:09.239 --> 00:24:11.032
and I hope you realize

445
00:24:11.032 --> 00:24:12.242
that you both--
- Yeah.

446
00:24:12.242 --> 00:24:14.744
- Need to start acting
like mature adults.

447
00:24:14.744 --> 00:24:15.579
- Yes. sir.

448
00:24:16.538 --> 00:24:17.706
I understand.

449
00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.419
Goddamn it. goddamn it!

450
00:24:26.339 --> 00:24:27.174
- Sorry.

451
00:24:28.258 --> 00:24:29.426
- What happened. man?

452
00:24:31.428 --> 00:24:32.554
- I left the map.

453
00:24:33.638 --> 00:24:35.182
- You left the map?

454
00:24:35.182 --> 00:24:38.602
I mean. that's like numero
uno. besides the papers.

455
00:24:41.271 --> 00:24:45.150
- Sorry. I slept in a little
bit and I forgot the map.

456
00:24:47.569 --> 00:24:50.280
- These people are paying
for our service. man.

457
00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:51.448
Like--

458
00:24:51.448 --> 00:24:52.908
- That is true.

459
00:24:52.908 --> 00:24:56.119
But some people who didn't know
about your newspaper company

460
00:24:56.119 --> 00:24:57.037
now know about it

461
00:24:58.038 --> 00:24:58.872
- Jesus Christ.

462
00:25:01.541 --> 00:25:03.293
You know what. fine. fuck it.

463
00:25:03.293 --> 00:25:04.586
Whatever. whatever.

464
00:25:05.962 --> 00:25:07.964
We've got the day off now.

465
00:25:07.964 --> 00:25:10.759
(lighter clicking)

466
00:25:10.759 --> 00:25:11.593
Give me a sec.

467
00:25:13.011 --> 00:25:15.013
Now we can do better shit.

468
00:25:15.013 --> 00:25:16.097
(can rattling)
All right.

469
00:25:16.097 --> 00:25:17.766
just chill for a moment. man.

470
00:25:17.766 --> 00:25:18.600
Yo. what's up. bro.

471
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.477
- Hey. what's up. man?

472
00:25:20.477 --> 00:25:21.436
Check it. check it. ready?

473
00:25:21.436 --> 00:25:24.147
So. it's "boobs." right?

474
00:25:24.147 --> 00:25:25.106
- Yeah.
- But it's "boobs"

475
00:25:25.106 --> 00:25:26.733
from the top.
- Uh-huh.

476
00:25:26.733 --> 00:25:28.818
- And then it's
"boobs" from the front.

477
00:25:28.818 --> 00:25:31.154
And then it's "boobs"
from the side. man.

478
00:25:31.154 --> 00:25:32.989
- Damn. dude.
- Because titties.

479
00:25:32.989 --> 00:25:34.324
- Hell yeah!
- Right?

480
00:25:34.324 --> 00:25:35.659
- Titties. bro.
- What's good with you. man?

481
00:25:35.659 --> 00:25:36.826
It's good to see
you. what's going on?

482
00:25:36.826 --> 00:25:38.495
- Not much. man.
just kicking it.

483
00:25:42.958 --> 00:25:44.000
- Who's your buddy
you brought with you?

484
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.002
- Uh. well. this is Ronnie.

485
00:25:46.002 --> 00:25:48.505
Ronnie. he goes to school
for art and shit. so--

486
00:25:48.505 --> 00:25:50.298
- Hey. Ronnie. come on
in here. you wanna tag?

487
00:25:50.298 --> 00:25:51.633
- Ronnie?
- Sure.

488
00:25:51.633 --> 00:25:52.175
- Come on. bro.
- You go to school for art.

489
00:25:52.175 --> 00:25:53.343
yeah?

490
00:25:53.343 --> 00:25:54.135
- Let's go. art boy.
- Come here!

491
00:25:54.135 --> 00:25:55.679
Come express yourself.

492
00:25:55.679 --> 00:25:57.305
You wanna play
around a little bit?

493
00:25:57.305 --> 00:25:58.139
- [Ronnie] Just right here?

494
00:25:58.139 --> 00:25:59.057
- Yeah. come on. dude.

495
00:25:59.057 --> 00:26:00.308
- The whole world's your canvas.

496
00:26:00.308 --> 00:26:01.101
Whatever inspires
you. man. dude.

497
00:26:01.101 --> 00:26:02.269
- Give it a shot.

498
00:26:02.269 --> 00:26:03.562
- Just like "boobs"
and "titties."

499
00:26:04.688 --> 00:26:05.522
- [Zach] Titties.

500
00:26:05.522 --> 00:26:06.940
(Zach giggling)

501
00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:08.024
(spray can rattling)

502
00:26:08.024 --> 00:26:09.568
Titty king.

503
00:26:09.568 --> 00:26:12.237
(spray hissing)

504
00:26:19.452 --> 00:26:20.745
- [Ronnie] Can I borrow
your white really quick?

505
00:26:20.745 --> 00:26:22.205
- [Guy] Yeah. sure man.

506
00:26:22.205 --> 00:26:23.039
Here.

507
00:26:27.877 --> 00:26:30.964
(spray can rattling)

508
00:26:32.215 --> 00:26:34.884
(spray hissing)

509
00:26:44.227 --> 00:26:46.021
Shit's inspiring.

510
00:26:46.021 --> 00:26:47.314
- [Zach] Dude.

511
00:26:47.314 --> 00:26:48.523
- That's cool. brah.

512
00:26:48.523 --> 00:26:50.400
- Hell yeah.
- I like it.

513
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.403
(upbeat drum music)

514
00:26:58.575 --> 00:27:01.244
(spray can rattling)

515
00:27:01.244 --> 00:27:03.913
(spray hissing)

516
00:27:10.253 --> 00:27:11.087
- Now.

517
00:27:12.505 --> 00:27:14.841
I'd like to take a second
to talk about the first time

518
00:27:14.841 --> 00:27:16.301
that you actually
tagged something.

519
00:27:16.301 --> 00:27:19.054
I think that's a
monumental moment.

520
00:27:20.221 --> 00:27:22.891
- I mean. yeah. it was
the moment I got hooked.

521
00:27:22.891 --> 00:27:25.477
You know. the instant
gratification of
putting your art on

522
00:27:25.477 --> 00:27:27.020
the ultimate canvas.

523
00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:28.355
- The ultimate canvas.

524
00:27:28.355 --> 00:27:31.149
Can you elaborate on
that a little bit?

525
00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:34.653
- Yeah. I mean nothing
beats it. it's the best.

526
00:27:34.653 --> 00:27:37.739
I mean. you just put your
art piece up on the wall

527
00:27:37.739 --> 00:27:40.784
and everyone who passes
by kinda has to look at it

528
00:27:40.784 --> 00:27:43.036
and if in some way
they relate to it

529
00:27:43.036 --> 00:27:44.287
then you just reached
someone in the world

530
00:27:44.287 --> 00:27:45.789
that doesn't even know you.

531
00:27:48.166 --> 00:27:49.000
- So.

532
00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:54.839
so this whole situation.
it made you lose your job?

533
00:27:54.839 --> 00:27:56.341
- No.

534
00:27:56.341 --> 00:27:58.760
I mean. I feel bad that I
fucked up the delivery route

535
00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.637
but me and Mr. Satton
talked about it

536
00:28:00.637 --> 00:28:02.180
and cleared everything up.

537
00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:04.557
And as far as Zach and I.
we hung out plenty of times

538
00:28:04.557 --> 00:28:06.309
and he even invited me
out to a party with him.

590
00:30:12.769 --> 00:30:14.854
You're really
passionate about art.

591
00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.274
- Yeah but I'm also
kind of a coward

592

when it comes to art as well.

593

yourself a coward?

00:30:25.281 --> 00:30:26.574
- I mean.

595
00:30:26.574 --> 00:30:28.868
I knew it would make me
happy almost all my life

596
00:30:28.868 --> 00:30:31.955
but I still never did
anything about it.

597
00:30:31.955 --> 00:30:34.582
- But you're following
your dream. aren't you?

598
00:30:37.293 --> 00:30:38.461
- I mean. yeah. but...

599
00:30:39.504 --> 00:30:41.005
It just doesn't feel the same

600
00:30:41.005 --> 00:30:44.092
because I haven't been
doing it until now. so...

601
00:30:44.092 --> 00:30:46.302
I'm getting there but
I'm just not there yet.

602
00:30:48.346 --> 00:30:49.806
- So what's holding you back?

603
00:30:51.266 --> 00:30:54.936
- For starters. definitely the
number one problem would be

604
00:30:54.936 --> 00:30:55.812
my ex-wife.

605
00:30:57.647 --> 00:30:59.107
I know. it's weird to say.

606
00:31:01.317 --> 00:31:04.279
- Do you miss your ex-wife?

607
00:31:04.279 --> 00:31:05.864
- No.
(girl laughing)

608
00:31:05.864 --> 00:31:07.365

- [Girl] What happened?

611
00:31:12.662 --> 00:31:14.789
- Well. her and her
dad. they both wanted me

612
00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:16.958
to just be this guy who made
a lot of money. you know?

613
00:31:16.958 --> 00:31:19.752
And that's just not
what I wanted to do.

614
00:31:19.752 --> 00:31:21.212
You know. I wanted to do art.

615
00:31:21.212 --> 00:31:22.964
I wanted to do something
that I could feel was valued

616
00:31:22.964 --> 00:31:24.924
and was impressive.
you know what I mean?

617
00:31:24.924 --> 00:31:26.342
- Yeah.
- So then I would like

618
00:31:26.342 --> 00:31:27.677
wow people. you
know what I mean?

619
00:31:27.677 --> 00:31:28.678
- [Man] Three round!

620
00:31:28.678 --> 00:31:30.263
- [Woman] Oh. shit!

621
00:31:31.347 --> 00:31:34.100
- Well. are you
financially stable now?

(girl laughing)

624
00:31:38.187 --> 00:31:41.190
- I mean. if you can call
living in a motel stable.

625
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:43.693
- Sometimes I wish I
lived in a motel. come on.

626
00:31:43.693 --> 00:31:46.279
(girl giggling)

627
00:31:46.279 --> 00:31:47.071
- Sure.

628
00:31:48.865 --> 00:31:49.699
- So.

629
00:31:52.493 --> 00:31:53.703
do you think that

630
00:31:54.871 --> 00:31:57.749
you might wanna be in
a relationship again?

631
00:31:59.542 --> 00:32:00.835
- Yeah. for sure.

632
00:32:02.253 --> 00:32:05.340
But it would definitely
have to be with a girl that.

633
00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:07.967
you know. is happy
that we're together

634
00:32:07.967 --> 00:32:10.136
because we're together.

635
00:32:10.136 --> 00:32:12.221
Not because the
materialistic stuff.

636
00:32:13.222 --> 00:32:14.307
- That's what love is.

637
00:32:14.307 --> 00:32:15.934
Everyone deserves to be happy.

638
00:32:17.936 --> 00:32:19.520
- Well. maybe everyone but me.

639
00:32:20.897 --> 00:32:23.775
- Look. you can have your
art and be happy too.

640
00:32:23.775 --> 00:32:25.902
Everyone deserves that.

book. actually.

659
00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:26.963
I remember getting it
after being inspired

660
00:33:26.963 --> 00:33:28.423
by Zach and his friend
when they took me

661
00:33:28.423 --> 00:33:30.633
to do graffiti
under the overpass.

662
00:33:31.759 --> 00:33:33.052
- See. that's what
I'm trying to get you

663
00:33:33.052 --> 00:33:34.303
to talk to me about.

664
00:33:34.303 --> 00:33:37.265
I want you to talk about
spray painting graffiti.

665
00:33:37.265 --> 00:33:38.057
Now.

666
00:33:39.267 --> 00:33:41.936
I really want to.
in the documentary.

667
00:33:43.229 --> 00:33:46.649
put together a montage
with these pages

668
00:33:46.649 --> 00:33:48.443
and have you talking
about graffiti over it.

669
00:33:48.443 --> 00:33:52.196
Now. am I asking the
wrong questions here?

670
00:33:52.196 --> 00:33:54.407
Like. when did you start
studying this book?

671
00:33:54.407 --> 00:33:55.491
- Look. I'm just trying
to tell the story

672
00:33:55.491 --> 00:33:56.993
how I wanna tell it.

673
00:33:56.993 --> 00:33:59.662
- So you went and did graffiti
with Zach and his friends

674
00:33:59.662 --> 00:34:01.831
and then you never
thought to do it anymore?

675
00:34:01.831 --> 00:34:05.043
You just wanted to hang
out and party and get high?

676
00:34:05.043 --> 00:34:06.502
- No. I mean. see.

677
00:34:06.502 --> 00:34:08.212
you're not even listening
to the whole story.

678
00:34:08.212 --> 00:34:10.214
This is the first time
I've gone to even a party

679
00:34:10.214 --> 00:34:11.716
since I got married.

680
00:34:11.716 --> 00:34:15.344
That party that I did go to
though was were I met Khyanah.

681
00:34:15.344 --> 00:34:17.180
- [Interviewer] Tell me
what happened with Khyanah.

682
00:34:18.848 --> 00:34:21.350
- [Ronnie] You know.
after I met Khyanah.

683
00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:22.935
like a little after.

684
00:34:22.935 --> 00:34:26.230
was when I actually
first did my graffiti.

685
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:29.358
Like tried it for the
first time and everything.

686
00:34:29.358 --> 00:34:32.361
(upbeat drum music)

687
00:34:38.034 --> 00:34:40.495

(Ronnie sighing)

690
00:34:57.970 --> 00:34:58.930
I don't know.

691
00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:00.515
I mean.

692
00:35:00.515 --> 00:35:02.809
I feel like a part of
me wanted to get caught.

693
00:35:02.809 --> 00:35:06.604
At first my nerves were
up and I was really afraid

694
00:35:06.604 --> 00:35:08.981
but it felt amazing
to do it. you know?

695
00:35:10.233 --> 00:35:12.235
- You wanted to get caught.

696
00:35:12.235 --> 00:35:14.570
- I just really didn't
have anything going for me.

697
00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:16.864
You know. and to me
graffiti is just like

698
00:35:16.864 --> 00:35:21.869
this fuck it kind
of movement and

699
00:35:22.745 --> 00:35:24.413
you know. whenever I do it.

700
00:35:24.413 --> 00:35:26.749
it feels like nothing
else really matters and

701
00:35:26.749 --> 00:35:30.211
that first time doing it
was when I first felt that.

702
00:35:30.211 --> 00:35:31.587
- So.

703
00:35:31.587 --> 00:35:33.673
whatever happened
with those first tags?

704
00:35:33.673 --> 00:35:35.800
Do they still exist?

705
00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:36.968
(Ronnie chuckling)

706
00:35:36.968 --> 00:35:39.011
- I don't know. I
couldn't even tell you.

707
00:35:39.011 --> 00:35:40.513
Probably nothing.

708
00:35:40.513 --> 00:35:43.349
- I just recently found these
surfacing themselves online.

709
00:35:46.394 --> 00:35:47.353
- [Ronnie] Oh. wow.

710
00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:56.195
(spray hissing)

711
00:35:56.195 --> 00:35:59.365
(spray cans rattling)

712
00:36:43.326 --> 00:36:45.536
(door knocking)

713
00:36:45.536 --> 00:36:46.954
Hey.

714
00:36:46.954 --> 00:36:49.290
What're you doing here?
- Hi.

715
00:36:50.708 --> 00:36:54.337
I spoke to Zach and I asked
him if I could get your number

716
00:36:54.337 --> 00:36:57.590
and he said that you
didn't have a phone

717
00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:01.761
and told me that the only
way I could talk to you

718
00:37:01.761 --> 00:37:03.679
was if I came by
your motel. so--

719
00:37:04.847 --> 00:37:05.681
- Okay.

720
00:37:06.849 --> 00:37:08.100
I just haven't really
had the chance to clean

721
00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:10.645
but you can just
wait if you want.

722
00:37:10.645 --> 00:37:11.479
- Okay.

723
00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:16.859
I was hoping that
you were gonna be

724
00:37:16.859 --> 00:37:18.861
at the get to together tonight.

725
00:37:18.861 --> 00:37:20.988
I was looking forward
to seeing you.

726
00:37:20.988 --> 00:37:23.324
- I don't think I'm
gonna be able to tonight.

727
00:37:23.324 --> 00:37:24.992
I just have a lot of school work

728
00:37:24.992 --> 00:37:26.494
and I got work in the morning.

729
00:37:27.662 --> 00:37:31.707
But if you want to reach
me outside of tonight.

730
00:37:31.707 --> 00:37:35.378
then you could try taking
my motel phone number.

731
00:37:35.378 --> 00:37:37.255
- Yeah. that would be great.

732
00:37:37.255 --> 00:37:38.714
(Khyanah chuckling)

733
00:37:38.714 --> 00:37:39.882
Here.

734
00:37:39.882 --> 00:37:40.716
- Um...

735
00:37:46.097 --> 00:37:46.931
- So.

736
00:37:48.849 --> 00:37:53.729
you maybe wanna grab some
dinner or lunch sometime soon?

737
00:37:55.189 --> 00:37:56.023
- Um...

738
00:37:58.192 --> 00:38:00.486
I'm not in a really
solid place right now.

739
00:38:01.988 --> 00:38:05.157
I mean. you saw this
place when you walked up.

740
00:38:05.157 --> 00:38:06.742
It's really shitty.

741
00:38:08.035 --> 00:38:09.412
- Look.

742
00:38:09.412 --> 00:38:11.122
I don't think you're a mess.

743
00:38:11.122 --> 00:38:11.956
In fact.

744
00:38:13.416 --> 00:38:15.418
I think you're one of the
first people that I've met

745
00:38:15.418 --> 00:38:17.003
whose got it all figured out.

746
00:38:18.421 --> 00:38:22.800
And it's not your place to
tell me who or what I deserve.

747
00:38:23.801 --> 00:38:25.636
- That night during the party.

748
00:38:27.096 --> 00:38:29.307
I felt like I wasn't gonna
see Khyanah ever again.

749
00:38:33.602 --> 00:38:36.439
When I did those first RC tags.

750
00:38:37.606 --> 00:38:39.692
I felt like I was slowly
becoming someone else.

751
00:38:44.613 --> 00:38:49.618
I just wanted to do this to let
this someone I was becoming.

752
00:38:51.954 --> 00:38:53.039
this persona.

753
00:38:54.707 --> 00:38:57.501
I wanted to let it manifest--

754
00:38:57.501 --> 00:39:01.922
- So. did you have a plan for
what you were going to paint?

755
00:39:01.922 --> 00:39:04.425
Where. what. why. when?

756
00:39:04.425 --> 00:39:06.761
I mean. tell me
details like that.

757
00:39:07.595 --> 00:39:09.221
(Ronnie sighing)

758
00:39:09.221 --> 00:39:11.307
- I wanted to be organized.

759
00:39:11.307 --> 00:39:13.893
I wanted to do everything
the right way I needed to.

760
00:39:21.233 --> 00:39:24.320
(Ronnie sighing)

761
00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.946
- Why did people
carve the rocks?

762
00:39:25.946 --> 00:39:27.907
You know. I mean. put the
president's faces on there

763
00:39:27.907 --> 00:39:28.866
on Mount Rushmore?

764
00:39:28.866 --> 00:39:30.326
Why'd they do that?

765
00:39:30.326 --> 00:39:32.244
They got a big kick
out of doing big faces

766
00:39:32.244 --> 00:39:34.205
or did they wanted
to leave a mark?

767
00:39:34.205 --> 00:39:35.498
They wanted to leave a mark.

768
00:39:35.498 --> 00:39:36.999
See. these people right here.

769
00:39:36.999 --> 00:39:41.170
they are our founding fathers.

770
00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:44.548
so we're gonna put their
big faces on this mountain

771
00:39:44.548 --> 00:39:46.342
and fuck who don't like it.

772
00:39:46.342 --> 00:39:47.927
(exciting music)

773
00:39:47.927 --> 00:39:49.678
So the fucker got up there
and started chiseling out

774
00:39:49.678 --> 00:39:52.014
his fucking nose and the
eyes and all that shit.

775
00:39:52.014 --> 00:39:54.016
Who gave him permission
to mark that shit up?

776
00:39:54.016 --> 00:39:55.267
You know what I mean?

777
00:39:55.267 --> 00:39:57.228
Maybe Indians had
a problem with him

778
00:39:57.228 --> 00:39:59.355
putting that dude's
face on a mountain.

779
00:39:59.355 --> 00:40:01.148
How come he didn't get arrested?

780
00:40:01.148 --> 00:40:02.608
It ain't no different. man.

781
00:40:02.608 --> 00:40:05.236
That his fucking mountain
that you scribed that name on.

782
00:40:05.236 --> 00:40:08.697
(exciting rock music)

783
00:40:08.697 --> 00:40:12.326
It's not like an addiction
but more like a sickness.

784
00:40:12.326 --> 00:40:14.620
You cannot control
yourself once you start.

785
00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.956
If you really understand
what you're doing.

786
00:40:16.956 --> 00:40:18.582
the minute you get
that first tag.

787
00:40:18.582 --> 00:40:21.043
you feel like. I
could've done that better

788
00:40:21.043 --> 00:40:22.545
and you gotta keep moving.

789
00:40:22.545 --> 00:40:24.213
- [Man In Video] The
repetitiveness of it

790
00:40:24.213 --> 00:40:25.714
gets really addicting.

791
00:40:25.714 --> 00:40:27.299
Every time you do it.

792
00:40:27.299 --> 00:40:29.176
you're like one step
closer to your goal.

793
00:40:29.176 --> 00:40:30.553
whatever that may be.

794
00:40:30.553 --> 00:40:32.012
- [Man On Video]
Graffiti is about

795
00:40:32.012 --> 00:40:34.014
being loved. hated. whatever.
just being recognized.

796
00:40:34.014 --> 00:40:36.350
The egos. the
beef. the jealousy.

797
00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:39.353
the law. the sicknesses.
the injuries.

798
00:40:39.353 --> 00:40:42.690
the hatred. the violence.

799
00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:43.941
That's graffiti.

800
00:40:43.941 --> 00:40:44.900
- [Man In Video]
Instead of looking

801
00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:46.235
at the person doing graffiti.

802
00:40:46.235 --> 00:40:47.528
maybe they should
look at that cause

803
00:40:47.528 --> 00:40:48.362
of why that person
started. you know?

804
00:40:48.362 --> 00:40:51.657
(exciting beat music)

805
00:40:51.657 --> 00:40:54.952
(foreign language music)

806
00:41:58.641 --> 00:42:01.810
(exciting beat music)

807
00:42:23.666 --> 00:42:26.377
(birds chirping)

808
00:43:00.327 --> 00:43:01.704
- Good.

809
00:43:01.704 --> 00:43:04.623
(Khyanah giggling)

810
00:43:11.547 --> 00:43:12.381
So.

811
00:43:14.133 --> 00:43:15.426
I write poetry.

812
00:43:19.597 --> 00:43:21.890
I don't really read
it to people or

813
00:43:23.559 --> 00:43:25.894
really show what I've written.

814
00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.071
- You're really good.

815
00:43:36.071 --> 00:43:36.905
- Really?

816
00:43:38.073 --> 00:43:40.075
I want to have them
published in a volume.

817
00:43:40.075 --> 00:43:40.909
- [Ronnie] Yeah?

818
00:43:42.328 --> 00:43:45.122
- My favorite poet is this
woman. Karyna McGlynn.

819
00:43:45.122 --> 00:43:46.081
- [Ronnie] Mm-hmm?

820
00:43:46.081 --> 00:43:47.416
- I wanna buy her work but

821
00:43:47.416 --> 00:43:49.585
I've been reading
her poems online

822
00:43:49.585 --> 00:43:53.964
and they just speak to
me in a haunting way.

823
00:43:53.964 --> 00:43:57.843
Like they're about
transformation and moving on

824
00:43:57.843 --> 00:44:00.095
and letting go in
life. you know?

825
00:44:01.722 --> 00:44:02.765
- Letting go of what?

826
00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:09.063
- I kinda had a
really hard year.

827
00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:11.065
I...

828
00:44:12.316 --> 00:44:13.859
I had a miscarriage.

829
00:44:14.943 --> 00:44:16.445
So.

830
00:44:16.445 --> 00:44:19.531
poetry's just helping
me get through that.

831
00:44:19.531 --> 00:44:21.283
I can express myself through it.

832
00:44:23.118 --> 00:44:24.495
- I am so sorry.

833
00:44:24.495 --> 00:44:25.329
That's...

834
00:44:26.372 --> 00:44:28.123
Wow. I'm sorry.

835
00:44:28.123 --> 00:44:28.957
- No.

836
00:44:29.958 --> 00:44:32.127
I don't want anyone in my life

837
00:44:32.127 --> 00:44:34.463
who pushes me away from poetry.

838
00:44:36.131 --> 00:44:37.966
- I think you should definitely
enter those competitions

839
00:44:37.966 --> 00:44:40.636
you talked about. for poetry.

840
00:44:40.636 --> 00:44:41.970
- Thank you.

841
00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:42.805
So.

842
00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:46.183
how's your art career going?

843
00:44:47.643 --> 00:44:49.478
- It's going pretty
well. actually.

844
00:44:49.478 --> 00:44:52.064
Doing a lot of experimental
things. you know.

845
00:44:52.064 --> 00:44:54.149
Kind of seeing what sticks.

846
00:44:54.149 --> 00:44:56.694
- You should do more
than just try though.

847
00:44:56.694 --> 00:44:57.945
Don't worry about it.

848
00:44:58.904 --> 00:44:59.738
Just do it.

849
00:45:00.906 --> 00:45:03.492
You should do
something big. huge.

850
00:45:03.492 --> 00:45:05.327
so everyone can see it

851
00:45:05.327 --> 00:45:08.914
and then you'll know what
direction to go into.

852
00:45:16.255 --> 00:45:17.423
- So.

853
00:45:17.423 --> 00:45:18.757
this is it.

854
00:45:18.757 --> 00:45:20.342
It's how it all started.

855
00:45:20.342 --> 00:45:23.053
This is how everybody
got to know you

856
00:45:23.053 --> 00:45:24.304
as the great street artist

857
00:45:24.304 --> 00:45:25.973
that you are known
as today. right?

858
00:45:27.433 --> 00:45:29.768
- From studying and researching

859
00:45:29.768 --> 00:45:32.312
all the videos about
the graffiti artists.

860
00:45:32.312 --> 00:45:34.606
you have to blast
your name everywhere

861
00:45:34.606 --> 00:45:37.192
and all over everything
that you can.

862
00:45:37.192 --> 00:45:40.070
- Did you feel like
Picasso about to create

863
00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:41.572
a bunch of cubist paintings

864
00:45:41.572 --> 00:45:44.867
or Jackson Pollock about to
drip some color on canvas?

865
00:45:46.201 --> 00:45:49.538
- I'm not sure. I just
know I had to do something.

866
00:45:49.538 --> 00:45:51.415
Because I told my dad I
was gonna be an artist

867
00:45:51.415 --> 00:45:54.668
and Khyanah seemed to
see something in me

868
00:45:54.668 --> 00:45:58.213
and she told me to do something
so big that. you know.

869
00:45:58.213 --> 00:46:00.215
as many people as
possible could see it.

870
00:46:01.467 --> 00:46:03.844
And I wanted to do
the hard work of

871
00:46:03.844 --> 00:46:06.430
tagging everywhere
that I possibly could.

872
00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:09.516
(upbeat drum music)

873
00:46:09.516 --> 00:46:10.726
- You can see the
center's real tight

874
00:46:10.726 --> 00:46:12.686
but the op is faded
and the bottom is faded

875
00:46:12.686 --> 00:46:15.564
and that's an up and down fade.

876
00:46:15.564 --> 00:46:16.815
- [Man On Video] And I still do.

877
00:46:16.815 --> 00:46:17.983
I just kept doing it and
doing it and doing it.

878
00:46:17.983 --> 00:46:20.819
You know but no one knows you.

879
00:46:20.819 --> 00:46:23.238
Except for. you know. the
few who know why you are.

880
00:46:23.238 --> 00:46:25.949
It's like some superhero
shit. you know?

881
00:46:25.949 --> 00:46:27.659
Like. you just fucking
fly up. do your shit.

882
00:46:27.659 --> 00:46:28.827
come back like you're just some

883
00:46:28.827 --> 00:46:30.370
mild-mannered
reporter. you know?

884
00:46:31.622 --> 00:46:32.831
- [Man On Video] For me.
writing was a release.

885
00:46:32.831 --> 00:46:35.459
It was an escape from my parents

886
00:46:35.459 --> 00:46:37.669
bitching and complaining
in the house.

887
00:46:37.669 --> 00:46:39.171
it was an escape from my block.

888
00:46:39.171 --> 00:46:41.256
I started writing to
get away from all that.

889
00:46:41.256 --> 00:46:43.425
to assume another identity.

890
00:46:43.425 --> 00:46:45.928
to have a good
time with my boys.

891
00:46:45.928 --> 00:46:48.847
to be down with some
rebellious shit.

892
00:46:48.847 --> 00:46:51.975
You stay anonymous
is who you are

893
00:46:51.975 --> 00:46:54.603
and that's the
whole point of it.

894
00:46:54.603 --> 00:46:55.771
- [Man On Video] They're
all like the wind. you know?

895
00:46:55.771 --> 00:46:57.856
You can't see 'em but
you could feel it.

896
00:46:57.856 --> 00:46:59.107
- [Man On Video] You
could have this sort of

897
00:46:59.107 --> 00:47:01.193
anonymous thing about
it where you could like

898
00:47:01.193 --> 00:47:04.154
have one kind of view.
portray yourself as one thing

899
00:47:04.154 --> 00:47:07.199
and then like change
into my other costume

900
00:47:07.199 --> 00:47:08.325
and I'm this other guy.

901
00:47:09.284 --> 00:47:10.118
Super hero.

902
00:47:12.621 --> 00:47:15.958
(exciting techno music)

903
00:47:19.127 --> 00:47:20.921
- [Man On Video] I mean.
graffiti's basically this.

904
00:47:20.921 --> 00:47:25.050
It's one. creating some kind
of letter or message. right?

905
00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:26.385
So we gotta design.

906
00:47:27.261 --> 00:47:29.972
Two. getting the supplies.

907
00:47:29.972 --> 00:47:32.099
Three. getting the spot.

908
00:47:32.099 --> 00:47:34.309
Four. getting to the spot.

909
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:37.855
Five. attempting it. pull it off

910
00:47:39.439 --> 00:47:42.150
and then coming back
and documenting it.

911
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:43.944
And that's it. you know?

912
00:47:43.944 --> 00:47:47.614
(exciting beat music)

913
00:47:47.614 --> 00:47:50.826
- The first time I make
certain graffiti was some rats.

914
00:47:50.826 --> 00:47:53.620
some small rats. you
know. like a shadow

915
00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:56.164
running around the
sidewalk of the city.

916
00:47:56.164 --> 00:48:01.169
This is the first rat
that I did in 1981 too.

917
00:48:02.296 --> 00:48:05.173
I wanted to invade
Paris with my images.

918
00:48:05.173 --> 00:48:07.259
- Yeah. it's just like
walking and breathing.

919
00:48:07.259 --> 00:48:10.053
If I'm out and I'm anywhere.

920
00:48:10.053 --> 00:48:11.305
I'm stickering.

921
00:48:12.723 --> 00:48:14.975
- I think that
putting up a sticker

922
00:48:14.975 --> 00:48:19.146
there's a. not show of
force. but a show of defiance

923
00:48:19.146 --> 00:48:21.356
and a show of self identity

924
00:48:21.356 --> 00:48:26.361
that I need to impose who
I am on the social system.

925
00:48:27.195 --> 00:48:28.864
which is what graffiti is.

926
00:48:28.864 --> 00:48:31.825
- You know. leave
your identity or DNA.

927
00:48:31.825 --> 00:48:33.327
a little touch of it
wherever you were.

928
00:48:33.327 --> 00:48:37.039
- And that was part of the
whole sticker community

929
00:48:37.039 --> 00:48:38.540
and that's how it got built up.

930
00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:40.208
People had the same idea I had

931
00:48:40.208 --> 00:48:42.210
of just I wanna make stickers.

932
00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:44.087
- [Man On Video] And
it's kinda like my mark.

933
00:48:44.087 --> 00:48:46.048
This is where I crush.

934
00:48:46.048 --> 00:48:48.216
- [Man On Video] It probably.

935
00:48:48.216 --> 00:48:50.260
in a lot of ways. it probably
saved my life. you know.

936
00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:53.680
Who knows what I would be doing
if it weren't for graffiti.

937
00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:54.640
- [Man On Video] You don't
really choose the arts.

938
00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:56.558
the arts choose you.

939
00:48:56.558 --> 00:48:58.644
You don't pick to
choose the triangle.

940
00:48:58.644 --> 00:49:00.062
the triangle picks you.

941
00:49:00.062 --> 00:49:02.397
You don't choose to
paint watercolors or oil.

942
00:49:03.315 --> 00:49:04.816
Your medium picks you.

943
00:49:04.816 --> 00:49:06.068
I don't know. man.

944
00:49:06.068 --> 00:49:07.903
I didn't paint. I
picked spray paint.

945
00:49:07.903 --> 00:49:09.071
so it picked me.

946
00:49:09.071 --> 00:49:11.490
- I've done a lot
around here. you know?

947
00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:14.409
I felt something and I
will be something. why?

948
00:49:14.409 --> 00:49:16.495
Because I made myself something.

949
00:49:16.495 --> 00:49:17.913
- [Man On Video] They're just
out there risking their life

950
00:49:17.913 --> 00:49:20.040
to paint something that
hopefully a few people

951
00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:21.583
might be able to
appreciate and that's it

952
00:49:21.583 --> 00:49:24.419
and I think there's something
to be said for that.

953
00:49:24.419 --> 00:49:25.712
I think that's
definitely something

954
00:49:25.712 --> 00:49:27.297
that's worth taking note of.

955
00:49:44.189 --> 00:49:47.401
(intense beat music)

956
00:49:47.401 --> 00:49:49.736
(spray hissing)

957
00:49:49.736 --> 00:49:53.115
(police sirens alarming)

958
00:50:03.208 --> 00:50:05.877
(spray hissing)

959
00:50:33.113 --> 00:50:35.741
(spray hissing)

960
00:51:22.454 --> 00:51:25.540
(spray can rattling)

961
00:51:27.417 --> 00:51:30.504
(intense beat music)

962
00:51:40.097 --> 00:51:41.765
(spray can rattling)

963
00:51:41.765 --> 00:51:44.392
(spray hissing)

964
00:52:28.895 --> 00:52:31.898
(traffic whooshing)

965
00:52:57.757 --> 00:53:00.468
- So we've got the
red paint. two letters

966
00:53:01.887 --> 00:53:03.430
and it's gonna be the
first time the entire city

967
00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:04.764
has seen all of this.

968
00:53:04.764 --> 00:53:07.309
Now. would you say that
this was the moment

969
00:53:07.309 --> 00:53:09.644
where you first hit that
artistic expression?

970
00:53:11.021 --> 00:53:14.691
- The biggest thing was
figuring out my organization

971
00:53:14.691 --> 00:53:19.696
and how to achieve my
graffiti and get it done.

972
00:53:20.572 --> 00:53:21.364
- How did you feel as an artist?

973
00:53:21.364 --> 00:53:22.824
Was it different?

974
00:53:22.824 --> 00:53:26.453
Did you feel like you were
gonna get into something big?

975
00:53:26.453 --> 00:53:30.498
- I feel like sometimes
things happen to artists

976
00:53:30.498 --> 00:53:32.667
whether it's success
or failure and it comes

977
00:53:32.667 --> 00:53:35.337
when they least expect
it or deserve it.

978
00:53:35.337 --> 00:53:37.797
- Hold on. are you saying that

979
00:53:37.797 --> 00:53:41.051
you think that some of the
recognition you received

980
00:53:41.051 --> 00:53:43.178
was not what your
artwork deserved?

981
00:53:44.638 --> 00:53:48.058
- In the end. it's really
the audience who matter

982
00:53:48.058 --> 00:53:50.227
and it's the audience
who has the power

983
00:53:51.728 --> 00:53:53.897
to make us who we are when
it comes to being artists.

984
00:53:55.523 --> 00:53:56.775
- All right. so.

985
00:53:58.193 --> 00:54:00.403
I'm just gonna go over this
first part for you guys.

986
00:54:00.403 --> 00:54:04.783
I want you to list two ways
to create a visual weight.

987
00:54:04.783 --> 00:54:06.534
Two ways.

988
00:54:06.534 --> 00:54:10.538
I need you to draw an
example of containment.

989
00:54:11.665 --> 00:54:13.959
It could be any
sort of containment.

990
00:54:15.377 --> 00:54:16.878
Come up with that theory.

991
00:54:16.878 --> 00:54:21.383
Now. number three. multiple
choice as well as number four.

992
00:54:22.509 --> 00:54:24.511
All right. everyone
has a pencil.

993
00:54:24.511 --> 00:54:27.097
You have 25 minutes
starting now.

994
00:54:28.765 --> 00:54:29.849
- Hey. man.

995
00:54:29.849 --> 00:54:30.934
Do you have a pencil?

996
00:54:30.934 --> 00:54:32.269
- What?
- Pencil.

997
00:54:38.858 --> 00:54:41.152
- Hey. have you been
on Instagram lately?

998
00:54:41.152 --> 00:54:42.570
- No. why?

999
00:54:42.570 --> 00:54:45.365
- There's this graffiti artist
that's been going viral.

1000
00:54:45.365 --> 00:54:47.742
I've been seeing him
on like every post.

1001
00:54:47.742 --> 00:54:48.952
- Yeah.

1002
00:54:48.952 --> 00:54:50.245
- He keeps putting
like "RC" everywhere.

1003
00:54:50.245 --> 00:54:52.580
I don't know. nobody
knows what it means.

1004
00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:53.748
Or like on Twitter.

1005
00:54:53.748 --> 00:54:55.709
so many people are
like tweeting about it.

1006
00:54:55.709 --> 00:54:59.254
Even Graffiti links. like.
it's getting really popular.

1007
00:54:59.254 --> 00:55:00.505
- Jeez.

1008
00:55:00.505 --> 00:55:02.424
- And he's like putting
these stickers around.

1009
00:55:02.424 --> 00:55:03.341
- What's going on?

1010
00:55:04.759 --> 00:55:06.761
- Have you heard of the
new like graffiti artist?

1011
00:55:06.761 --> 00:55:08.596
He's been going viral.

1012
00:55:08.596 --> 00:55:10.557
Look. so he's on Instagram.

1013
00:55:10.557 --> 00:55:12.434
Graffiti Mash posted it.

1014
00:55:12.434 --> 00:55:15.061
I don't know. he just keeps
putting like "RC" everywhere.

1015
00:55:15.061 --> 00:55:17.105
But like I don't
know what that means.

1016
00:55:17.105 --> 00:55:18.315
But...

1017
00:55:18.315 --> 00:55:20.567
Look. see. there's the same "RC"

1018
00:55:20.567 --> 00:55:23.153
and then he also is putting
like stickers up everywhere.

1019
00:55:23.153 --> 00:55:24.112
- They're pretty tight.

1020
00:55:24.112 --> 00:55:26.072
- They're so cool. I'd buy one.

1021
00:55:26.072 --> 00:55:28.742
(chiming music)

1022
00:55:32.245 --> 00:55:35.415
(pleasant drum music)

1023
00:56:19.042 --> 00:56:21.294
- All right. what're you
guys working on over there?

1024
00:56:21.294 --> 00:56:23.838
Everybody done with
their assignments?

1025
00:56:23.838 --> 00:56:25.173
Please pass them
up to the front.

1026
00:56:25.173 --> 00:56:27.884
We're about out of time.

1027
00:56:31.096 --> 00:56:32.013
- You know. I don't
even have to look

1028
00:56:32.013 --> 00:56:34.224
through all these to tell you.

1029
00:56:34.224 --> 00:56:36.935
When I first saw these.
my first thought was.

1030
00:56:38.103 --> 00:56:41.648
the whole world is
my canvas. literally.

1031
00:56:41.648 --> 00:56:45.235
and I could just spray.
spill all my frustrations

1032
00:56:45.235 --> 00:56:46.861
all over it if I wanted to.

1033
00:56:48.321 --> 00:56:50.949
- Tell me more about what you
mean by that. by frustrations.

1034
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:52.784
(Ronnie chuckling)

1035
00:56:52.784 --> 00:56:53.701
- I mean.

1036
00:56:53.701 --> 00:56:55.120
isn't that why we're here?

1037
00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:56.496
The lights.

1038
00:56:56.496 --> 00:56:57.914
the camera.

1039
00:56:57.914 --> 00:56:58.998
all your questions?

1040
00:57:02.085 --> 00:57:03.420
What's that for?

1041
00:57:04.629 --> 00:57:08.299
- You have not paid for
three fucking weeks!

1042
00:57:08.299 --> 00:57:10.093
I'm getting tired
of this shit. man.

1043
00:57:13.012 --> 00:57:14.472
- [Ronnie] I get paid tomorrow.

1044
00:57:14.472 --> 00:57:15.348
- Tomorrow?

1045
00:57:15.348 --> 00:57:16.558
- Yeah.
- What?

1046
00:57:16.558 --> 00:57:18.435
It's always fucking
tomorrow with you guys.

1047
00:57:18.435 --> 00:57:20.353
I'll pick up the
garbage tomorrow.

1048
00:57:20.353 --> 00:57:21.896
I'll pay my rent tomorrow.

1049
00:57:21.896 --> 00:57:23.523
I'll suck your dick tomorrow.

1050
00:57:23.523 --> 00:57:24.732
No!

1051
00:57:24.732 --> 00:57:26.276
I'll tell you what
I'm gonna do tomorrow.

1052
00:57:26.276 --> 00:57:28.403
I'm gonna come back down
here. if I don't get paid.

1053
00:57:28.403 --> 00:57:30.530
I'm gonna kick this
fucking door in

1054
00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:32.240
and I'm gonna gather
up all your shit

1055
00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:33.491
and I'm gonna sprinkle it

1056
00:57:33.491 --> 00:57:35.660
across the fucking
parking lot of tomorrow.

1057
00:57:36.536 --> 00:57:37.745
You get it?

1058
00:57:37.745 --> 00:57:39.038
- [Ronnie] Yeah. I get it.

1059
00:57:41.207 --> 00:57:43.001
- This is a no smoking room.

1060
00:57:43.001 --> 00:57:44.502
- I'm not smoking in here.

1061
00:57:44.502 --> 00:57:46.921
- I can fucking smell you from
the parking lot of tomorrow.

1062
00:57:46.921 --> 00:57:49.132
So. wrap up a towel.

1063
00:57:49.132 --> 00:57:50.758
put it under the door

1064
00:57:50.758 --> 00:57:53.428
or fucking smoke your
doobie somewhere else.

1065
00:57:53.428 --> 00:57:54.762
All right?

1066
00:57:54.762 --> 00:57:55.597
Tomorrow.

1067
00:57:56.764 --> 00:57:57.891
And if I don't get it.

1068
00:57:59.767 --> 00:58:01.144
I already fucking told you.

1069
00:58:10.528 --> 00:58:13.281
(Ronnie sighing)

1070
00:58:52.654 --> 00:58:55.323
(light clicking)

1071
00:59:09.087 --> 00:59:11.839
(Ronnie sighing)

1072
00:59:32.652 --> 00:59:35.655
(upbeat drum music)

1073
01:00:58.946 --> 01:01:01.783
(train whooshing)

1074
01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:32.605
(can rattling)
(upbeat drum music)

1075
01:02:04.846 --> 01:02:07.515
(spray hissing)

1076
01:02:33.666 --> 01:02:35.293
- All right. guys.
this Seth Williams.

1077
01:02:35.293 --> 01:02:36.711
I'm right here.

1078
01:02:36.711 --> 01:02:38.045
Hold on man. whoa. whoa.
whoa. don't move. don't move.

1079
01:02:38.045 --> 01:02:39.172
This is Seth Williams.

1080
01:02:40.256 --> 01:02:41.507
This is crazy.
we're with the guy.

1081
01:02:41.507 --> 01:02:42.550
This is the guy. I found him.

1082
01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:43.718
I'm the one that found him.

1083
01:02:43.718 --> 01:02:44.719
He's crazy!

1084
01:02:44.719 --> 01:02:46.220
Crazy!

1085
01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:47.972
So. he's over here. he's doing
his new latest art piece.

1086
01:02:47.972 --> 01:02:51.726
Hey. it looks like it
says. "We live paycheck..."

1087
01:02:51.726 --> 01:02:53.519
It says. "We live
paycheck to paycheck."

1088
01:02:53.519 --> 01:02:55.271
So. hold on. man.
don't go anywhere.

1089
01:02:55.271 --> 01:02:56.981
Everyone wants to
know who you are.

1090
01:02:56.981 --> 01:02:58.483
Everyone. you're all
over the internet.

1091
01:02:58.483 --> 01:02:59.942
What's going on?

1092
01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:00.902
Everyone wants to understand
what're you doing here?

1093
01:03:00.902 --> 01:03:01.819
What does this all mean?

1094
01:03:01.819 --> 01:03:03.070
Why do you have a mask on?

1095
01:03:03.070 --> 01:03:04.405
What're you. some
Batman out here

1096
01:03:04.405 --> 01:03:06.616
doing just art
pieces or whatever?

1097
01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:08.242
Tell us a little
bit about yourself.

1098
01:03:08.242 --> 01:03:09.827
(crickets chirping)

1099
01:03:09.827 --> 01:03:11.662
Okay. all right. if
you're not gonna tell us

1100
01:03:11.662 --> 01:03:13.164
a little bit about
yourself. what does it mean?

1101
01:03:13.164 --> 01:03:14.332
Why are you sending
these messages?

1102
01:03:14.332 --> 01:03:15.333
What is RC?

1103
01:03:15.333 --> 01:03:16.626
What the hell are you wearing?

1104
01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:18.252
What does RC mean?

1105
01:03:18.252 --> 01:03:19.754
What does the RC stand for?

1106
01:03:19.754 --> 01:03:20.922
There's fan theories.

1107
01:03:20.922 --> 01:03:22.423
Everyone's asked the question.

1108
01:03:22.423 --> 01:03:24.425
I have my own fan theory.
I've said it on this channel.

1109
01:03:24.425 --> 01:03:25.510
I said it first.

1110
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:26.636
So. what does it all mean?

1111
01:03:26.636 --> 01:03:28.054
What does...

1112
01:03:28.054 --> 01:03:29.388
(spray can rattling)

1113
01:03:29.388 --> 01:03:30.473
What does RC stand for?

1114
01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:31.891
Does it...
(spray can rattling)

1115
01:03:31.891 --> 01:03:33.351
Does it stand for Rattle-Can?

1116
01:03:34.352 --> 01:03:35.937
It means Rattle-Can?

1117
01:03:35.937 --> 01:03:36.979
You know what it means?

1118
01:03:36.979 --> 01:03:39.232
There he is. guys. RC.

1119
01:03:39.232 --> 01:03:40.566
You heard it from me
first. it's Rattle-Can.

1120
01:03:40.566 --> 01:03:41.859
His name's Rattle-Can.

1121
01:03:41.859 --> 01:03:42.985
I coined it for him.

1122
01:03:42.985 --> 01:03:44.862
This is Epic Newsroom.
Seth Williams.

1123
01:03:44.862 --> 01:03:47.657
Your boy is out here. he's
out here in the tunnels.

1124
01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:48.908
he's figuring it out.

1125
01:03:48.908 --> 01:03:51.327
He knows all about
the latest graffiti.

1126
01:03:51.327 --> 01:03:55.081
This is the latest art piece
from RC. now named Rattle-Can.

1127
01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:57.375
It says. "We all live
paycheck to paycheck."

1128
01:03:57.375 --> 01:03:59.293
Come on. guys. we say it first.

1129
01:03:59.293 --> 01:04:01.754
You saw it here. right here
on this channel from me.

1130
01:04:01.754 --> 01:04:02.797

Be sure to like and subscribe.

1132
01:04:04.632 --> 01:04:06.551
Share it. tell your

tell your father about it
because we're out here.

1134
01:04:08.261 --> 01:04:09.470
I'm out here.

1135
01:04:09.470 --> 01:04:11.931
Your boy. your boy's out
here talking about it.

1136
01:04:11.931 --> 01:04:13.307
We live paycheck to paycheck.

1137
01:04:13.307 --> 01:04:14.141
What do you guys think?

1138
01:04:14.141 --> 01:04:15.059
Like and subscribe.

1139
01:04:15.059 --> 01:04:17.645
(upbeat music)

1140
01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:28.030
- I was just so constantly
frustrated about.

1141
01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:32.201
you know. about how our society
is just all about money.

1142
01:04:34.036 --> 01:04:37.957
But then that whole YouTube
video changed everything.

1143
01:04:41.377 --> 01:04:43.379
It was ridiculous.

1144
01:04:43.379 --> 01:04:45.840
Everyone was talking
about Rattle-Can non-stop.

1145
01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:49.760
- All right. who's ready to
give their presentations?

1146
01:04:50.636 --> 01:04:51.554
Ronnie?

1147
01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:52.722
You look like you're ready.

1148
01:04:53.639 --> 01:04:54.765
Go forward with yours.

1149
01:04:57.977 --> 01:04:58.811
Thank you.

1150
01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:03.399
- What I did was. at
first I drew it on paper

1151
01:05:03.399 --> 01:05:06.319
with a sketch pencil
and then I used a marker

1152
01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:07.820
for a little more detail

1153
01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:11.574
and then I used a computer
and a scanner here at school.

1154
01:05:11.574 --> 01:05:13.409
up in the library.

1155
01:05:13.409 --> 01:05:17.371
and pretty much I put
this into a picture file

1156
01:05:17.371 --> 01:05:20.041
and used photo editing
and digital illustration

1157
01:05:21.334 --> 01:05:24.211
software to detail
most everything.

1158
01:05:25.254 --> 01:05:26.714
And also to color the photo.

1159
01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.467
These are also
really commonly used

1160
01:05:29.467 --> 01:05:31.677
techniques in graphic design

1161
01:05:31.677 --> 01:05:33.971
and by modern comic
book colorists.

1162
01:05:33.971 --> 01:05:36.182
And this particular
work actually
demonstrates progression

1163
01:05:36.182 --> 01:05:40.269
of Van Gogh's artistic style
after his arrival in Paris.

1164
01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:43.356
As you actually look
above Tanguy's hat here.

1165
01:05:43.356 --> 01:05:45.983
it's actually a
really great painting

1166
01:05:48.277 --> 01:05:49.737
of Mt. Fuji

1167
01:05:49.737 --> 01:05:53.783
and it's also interesting
to note down here with

1168
01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:55.451
Kabuki actors...

1169
01:05:55.451 --> 01:05:57.620
actresses. down here
in the bottom right

1170
01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:59.246
and the left near his shoulder.

1171
01:05:59.246 --> 01:06:02.583
And although he was heavily
influenced by Japanese prints.

1172
01:06:02.583 --> 01:06:04.627
he does not at all veer from

1173
01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:06.629
his own personal style
of portrait painting.

1174
01:06:06.629 --> 01:06:07.797
which I really admire.

1175
01:06:15.429 --> 01:06:18.099
(clock ticking)

1176
01:06:21.268 --> 01:06:22.937
- Look. Ronnie. I
have to tell you

1177
01:06:22.937 --> 01:06:25.940
that you're in jeopardizing
of failing this course.

1178
01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:28.985
I wanna see how you
wanna utilize your
talents as an artist

1179
01:06:28.985 --> 01:06:31.445
to get a job once you graduate.

1180
01:06:31.445 --> 01:06:34.824
No one's gonna pay you to
recreate a Van Gogh painting.

1181
01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:36.659
- You said for the
assignment you wanted us

1182
01:06:36.659 --> 01:06:39.036
to recreate and/or reproduce

1183
01:06:39.036 --> 01:06:41.122
a famous piece of
art in our own way.

1184
01:06:41.122 --> 01:06:42.581
That's all you said.

1185
01:06:42.581 --> 01:06:45.626
You didn't say. recreate.
reproduce a famous piece of art

1186
01:06:45.626 --> 01:06:47.837
and after you get your
A or B grade on it.

1187
01:06:47.837 --> 01:06:49.755
go try to sell it and
make sure that it sells.

1188
01:06:49.755 --> 01:06:51.215
Like. that wasn't the
point of the assignment.

1189
01:06:51.215 --> 01:06:53.467
so I did exactly what you asked
of recreating or reproduce--

1190
01:06:53.467 --> 01:06:54.719
- What makes you happy?

1191
01:06:54.719 --> 01:06:58.180
I mean. why don't you
try to find a way to be

1192
01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:01.100
like this guy. RC. the
local street artist.

1193
01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:04.478
RC. he's blowing up now. he's
on YouTube. he's on Instagram.

1194
01:07:04.478 --> 01:07:06.605
He's gone viral.

1195
01:07:06.605 --> 01:07:09.025
Just find a way to
take what's yours

1196
01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:10.735
and turn it into pop culture.

1197
01:07:10.735 --> 01:07:12.570
- Okay. well first
off. I don't think.

1198
01:07:12.570 --> 01:07:17.324
from what I've seen at least.
RC doesn't do pop culture art

1199
01:07:17.324 --> 01:07:21.829
and I'm not RC. so I'm not
looking to do anything relevant

1200
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:23.998
or equal to pop culture art.

1201
01:07:23.998 --> 01:07:27.668
- Look. I just want you to
make what makes you happy

1202
01:07:27.668 --> 01:07:30.379
and then turn it into
something bigger.

1203
01:07:32.173 --> 01:07:33.799
- All right.

1204
01:07:33.799 --> 01:07:35.009
Can I get my grading paper?

1205
01:07:35.843 --> 01:07:37.636
- [Dexter] Of course.

1206
01:07:57.323 --> 01:07:58.532
- [Khyanah] Ronnie.

1207
01:07:58.532 --> 01:08:01.494
(Ronnie chuckling)

1208
01:08:04.663 --> 01:08:05.581
Oh my gosh.

1209
01:08:11.837 --> 01:08:12.671
Wow.

1210
01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:16.217
It's a book from
my favorite poet.

1211
01:08:17.384 --> 01:08:19.053
- [Ronnie] Why. do you
already have a copy?

1212
01:08:19.053 --> 01:08:21.806
- No. I never got
around to buying it.

1213
01:08:21.806 --> 01:08:22.640
- Oh.

1214
01:08:25.226 --> 01:08:26.477
- Speaking of artists.

1215
01:08:26.477 --> 01:08:28.062
there's something I
wanted to show you.

1216
01:08:28.062 --> 01:08:28.896
- Yeah?

1217
01:08:31.899 --> 01:08:33.067
- Have you seen this guy?

1218
01:08:33.067 --> 01:08:35.361
He's all over social
media right now.

1219
01:08:35.361 --> 01:08:36.862
Look.

1220
01:08:36.862 --> 01:08:40.282
How come you don't look up
any of this on the internet?

1221
01:08:40.282 --> 01:08:42.576
- I actually don't have
internet. honestly.

1222
01:08:42.576 --> 01:08:43.410
- What?

1223
01:08:43.410 --> 01:08:44.620
- Yeah. I kinda...

1224
01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:45.704
Where did I put it?

1225
01:08:50.543 --> 01:08:53.921
I kinda just do
all my work on here

1226
01:08:53.921 --> 01:08:55.297
but I still don't have wifi.

1227
01:08:56.715 --> 01:08:58.759
I draw some of my
drawings in here

1228
01:08:58.759 --> 01:09:00.594
and I'll edit it in here.

1229
01:09:00.594 --> 01:09:03.180
Then I'll print it

1230
01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:05.641
and it'll come off
like that poster.

1231
01:09:05.641 --> 01:09:08.102
- Wait. that's your work?

1232
01:09:08.102 --> 01:09:09.395
- Yeah. I did it on here.

1233
01:09:09.395 --> 01:09:11.564
There's "Deep 6. High 5."

1234
01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:13.691
- If you would just
get a cellphone.

1235
01:09:13.691 --> 01:09:16.902
not only could you keep
up with the art world

1236
01:09:16.902 --> 01:09:19.280
but I could talk to you everyday

1237
01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:21.407
and then I wouldn't
miss you all the time.

1238
01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:26.620
- Well. if I got a phone you'd
probably be the only one.

1239
01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:27.955
only number I dialed.

1240
01:09:29.331 --> 01:09:33.043
- Well. baby. my number's
the only one you need.

1241
01:09:33.043 --> 01:09:33.878
- You're right.

1242
01:09:33.878 --> 01:09:35.462
(Khyanah giggling)

1243
01:09:35.462 --> 01:09:38.632
(dramatic beat music)

1244
01:10:37.149 --> 01:10:40.277
(dramatic beat music)

1245
01:11:00.839 --> 01:11:03.884
(video game gunshots popping)

1246
01:11:03.884 --> 01:11:05.552
- Fuck you.
- Oh. by the way.

1247
01:11:05.552 --> 01:11:06.971
- What up. homie?

1248
01:11:08.722 --> 01:11:10.808
- You know that girl
I've been talking to?

1249
01:11:10.808 --> 01:11:11.892
Khyanah?
- Oh yeah.

1250
01:11:11.892 --> 01:11:13.560
That Khyanah.

1251
01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:14.603
- Yeah.

1252
01:11:14.603 --> 01:11:16.105
So.

1253
01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:19.650
we're actually going to
talk to each other more.

1254
01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:21.318
So I got this cellphone

1255
01:11:21.318 --> 01:11:22.361
but I don't really
know how to set it up.

1256
01:11:22.361 --> 01:11:23.529
So I was wondering

1257
01:11:23.529 --> 01:11:24.947
if you could help me.
- What the fuck?

1258
01:11:24.947 --> 01:11:25.781
(Ronnie chuckling)

1259
01:11:25.781 --> 01:11:27.950
You with a phone?

1260
01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:29.660
- So. let me stop you there.

1261
01:11:30.869 --> 01:11:33.247
While we're talking
about cellphones.

1262
01:11:33.247 --> 01:11:34.415
- Yeah.

1263
01:11:34.415 --> 01:11:36.333
Fucking cellphones.
what about it?

1264
01:11:36.333 --> 01:11:37.793
- You know I have
to bring it up.

1265
01:11:37.793 --> 01:11:40.004
you know I have to address it.

1266
01:11:40.004 --> 01:11:44.258
Is it true that you made the
painting "Cellphone Society?"

1267
01:11:44.258 --> 01:11:46.969
Now. there are rumors that
there was an imposter involved

1268
01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:49.638
and that he may have done
the painting himself.

1269
01:11:49.638 --> 01:11:52.599
The public doesn't have
an actual truth on this.

1270
01:11:52.599 --> 01:11:55.019
Now. we have some
people saying that...

1271
01:11:55.019 --> 01:11:56.437
that you did did the painting.

1272
01:11:56.437 --> 01:11:57.813
We have other people
saying that you took credit

1273
01:11:57.813 --> 01:11:59.982
for whoever didn't
do the painting.

1274
01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:03.277
Now you have the chance to
give the truth to the people.

1275
01:12:03.277 --> 01:12:04.361
right here. right now.

1276
01:12:05.863 --> 01:12:09.325
- Yes. I made the
cellphone painting.

1277
01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:14.121
But I make my art pieces
for many different reasons

1278
01:12:14.121 --> 01:12:16.040
but I only do them for reasons.

1279
01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:18.459
I don't just do them
just to make them.

1280
01:12:43.233 --> 01:12:45.986
(Ronnie sighing)

1281
01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.669
(phone chiming)

1282
01:13:32.366 --> 01:13:35.536
(exciting rock music)

1283
01:13:36.495 --> 01:13:40.207
(man yelling muffled lyrics)

1284
01:14:21.206 --> 01:14:25.085
(spray can rattling)

1285
01:14:25.085 --> 01:14:28.255
(exciting rock music)

1286
01:14:58.452 --> 01:15:01.121
(spray hissing)

1287
01:15:13.592 --> 01:15:15.052
- Here we go.

1288
01:15:15.052 --> 01:15:17.179
It just pisses me off because
she found my phone number.

1289
01:15:17.179 --> 01:15:19.932
Yeah. she's found my phone
number and sent me this.

1290
01:15:19.932 --> 01:15:21.475
I don't get it.

1291
01:15:21.475 --> 01:15:23.936
why do cellphones have to
dictate everything we do?

1292
01:15:25.145 --> 01:15:27.439
- How's everybody today?

1293
01:15:27.439 --> 01:15:28.398
Thursday. right?

1294
01:15:33.028 --> 01:15:34.279
This is the wrong test.

1295
01:15:35.697 --> 01:15:37.157
I must have misplaced them.

1296
01:15:37.157 --> 01:15:39.743
Give me one minute. I
have to go reprint these.

1297
01:15:44.831 --> 01:15:45.999
How're you doing today?

1298
01:15:45.999 --> 01:15:48.418
- Good. how are you?
- Good.

1299
01:15:48.418 --> 01:15:51.547
- Yo. guys. did you hear
that Rattle-Can got arrested?

1300
01:15:51.547 --> 01:15:53.048
- What?
- What?

1301
01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:55.676
- Yeah. seriously. it's
all over my social medias.

1302
01:15:56.635 --> 01:15:58.095
- That can't be right.

1303
01:15:58.095 --> 01:16:01.515
I thought he was pretty
good at not getting caught.

1304
01:16:01.515 --> 01:16:03.183
- Dude. I have no idea.

1305
01:16:03.183 --> 01:16:04.476
Just Google it.

1306
01:16:04.476 --> 01:16:06.061
It's gonna be there.

1307
01:16:08.772 --> 01:16:10.190
- [Male Anchor] And
now he's in custody.

1308
01:16:10.190 --> 01:16:11.441
- [Female Anchor]
The police department

1309
01:16:11.441 --> 01:16:12.734
working on the case
since last month.

1310
01:16:12.734 --> 01:16:14.361
- [Officer] You didn't
do any of these?

1311
01:16:14.361 --> 01:16:16.863
- [Man] I can't say I did.
I can't say I didn't. man.

1312
01:16:16.863 --> 01:16:18.782
You know. you got
all them pics. man.

1313
01:16:18.782 --> 01:16:20.200
You got all them answers.

1314
01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:21.451
- [Officer] All right.
that's why I'm asking.

1315
01:16:21.451 --> 01:16:23.370
All right. stand up. man.

1316
01:16:23.370 --> 01:16:25.372
Put your hands behind your back.

1317
01:16:25.372 --> 01:16:27.207
Put your hands behind
your back. (man mumbling)

1318
01:16:27.207 --> 01:16:28.375
Put your hands behind your back.

1319
01:16:28.375 --> 01:16:29.626
All right.

1320
01:16:29.626 --> 01:16:32.713
Ma'am. can you step back
real quick. thank you.

1321
01:16:32.713 --> 01:16:33.672
Nope.

1322
01:16:33.672 --> 01:16:34.881
- [Male Reporter] 20 years old.

1323
01:16:34.881 --> 01:16:36.049
is the man behind
multiple graffiti tags

1324
01:16:36.049 --> 01:16:37.259
throughout the city.

1325
01:16:37.259 --> 01:16:38.594
Take a look at this
video right here.

1326
01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:40.345
They estimate the
total cost for damages

1327
01:16:40.345 --> 01:16:41.680
and clean up for the incidents

1328
01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:43.849
more than five thousand dollars.

1329
01:16:50.230 --> 01:16:51.732
(Ronnie chuckling)

1330
01:16:51.732 --> 01:16:54.443
- Okay. here's the most recent
news apparently had to say.

1331
01:16:54.443 --> 01:16:57.487
"This review today is
about his final art piece

1332
01:16:57.487 --> 01:16:59.281
"and the artwork appears
to be of a zombie

1333
01:16:59.281 --> 01:17:01.992
"with his head displayed
as a cellphone.

1334
01:17:01.992 --> 01:17:03.410
"The statement with
the artwork proclaims.

1335
01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:05.454
"We are a cellphone society

1336
01:17:05.454 --> 01:17:08.415
"and we personally find this
contradicting art piece.

1337
01:17:08.415 --> 01:17:10.584
"which lacks imagination.

1338
01:17:10.584 --> 01:17:13.128
"and this statement
seems to claim

1339
01:17:13.128 --> 01:17:16.590
"phone and the internet are
used to brainwash the public.

1340
01:17:17.716 --> 01:17:19.176
"If the intent
was to bring about

1341
01:17:19.176 --> 01:17:20.886
"awareness toward technology.

1342
01:17:20.886 --> 01:17:22.721
"then maybe Rattle-Can
should consider that

1343
01:17:22.721 --> 01:17:25.098
"we as a people
influence the media.

1344
01:17:26.975 --> 01:17:29.895
"The media and social
world have been picked on

1345
01:17:29.895 --> 01:17:32.064
"for spreading
ignorance in the past.

1346
01:17:32.064 --> 01:17:33.482
"The real ignorance
is to believe

01:17:33.482 --> 01:17:36.026
"people don't have
independent thought.

1348
01:17:36.026 --> 01:17:37.819
"But we say to Rattle-Can

01:17:37.819 --> 01:17:40.155
"as it is best to consider
one important fact.

"technology. the

01:17:45.035 --> 01:17:47.287

"Are literally the only

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:55.462
(Ronnie clearing throat)

1354
01:17:55.462 --> 01:17:57.381
"was considered an artist.

1355
01:17:59.007 --> 01:18:02.219
"This is a career short-lived
and we should all celebrate

1356
01:18:02.219 --> 01:18:04.429
"another talentless
vandal behind bars."

1357
01:18:08.266 --> 01:18:09.976
So. I don't know about you guys

1358
01:18:09.976 --> 01:18:14.523
but that sounds like complete
and utter bullshit to me.

1359
01:18:14.523 --> 01:18:16.191
And. I don't know...

1360
01:18:17.150 --> 01:18:18.527
I don't know about you guys.

1361
01:18:18.527 --> 01:18:20.487
but I think everyone's
getting a little too offended

1362
01:18:20.487 --> 01:18:21.697
by such a little thing.

1363
01:18:22.739 --> 01:18:23.824
It's just frustrating.

1364
01:18:52.853 --> 01:18:56.231
(Khyanah knocking)

1365
01:18:56.231 --> 01:18:58.191
- What's the matter with you?
- Come on.

1366
01:18:58.191 --> 01:18:59.818
- [Khyanah] What did
you wanna talk about?

1367
01:18:59.818 --> 01:19:02.571
(Ronnie huffing)

1368
01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:05.282
- Have you heard
what's going on?

1369
01:19:07.117 --> 01:19:08.368
(Ronnie sighing)

1370
01:19:08.368 --> 01:19:10.120
This fucking stupid ass phone.

1371
01:19:13.206 --> 01:19:15.000
- Yeah. it's all
over social media.

1372
01:19:16.418 --> 01:19:18.545
But the guy was caught. his
art piece sucks. so what?

1373
01:19:19.713 --> 01:19:21.339
What's going on
between you and me?

1374
01:19:23.216 --> 01:19:24.342
- What are you and me?

1375
01:19:25.343 --> 01:19:27.012
- [Khyanah] What do you mean?

1376
01:19:27.012 --> 01:19:28.597
- Like. what are we?

1377
01:19:30.515 --> 01:19:31.349
- I don't know.

1378
01:19:34.644 --> 01:19:35.854
- You know. Khyanah.

1379
01:19:35.854 --> 01:19:38.732
I was doing really well
with my art career.

1380
01:19:38.732 --> 01:19:40.942
I had people
appreciating my art.

1381
01:19:40.942 --> 01:19:42.277
they were talking about it

1382
01:19:42.277 --> 01:19:45.739
and people were actually
talking about me

1383
01:19:45.739 --> 01:19:47.991
and who I was making it

1384
01:19:47.991 --> 01:19:50.952
and now they're not because
I got a fucking cellphone

1385
01:19:50.952 --> 01:19:55.165
like you asked and it just
completely ruined everything.

1386
01:19:55.165 --> 01:19:55.999
Okay?

1387
01:19:57.209 --> 01:19:59.169
- What are you talking about?

1388
01:19:59.169 --> 01:20:01.338
- The phone. Khyanah.
the cellphone!

1389
01:20:01.338 --> 01:20:02.589
Literally going
the polar opposite

1390
01:20:02.589 --> 01:20:04.090
of what an artist should be.

1391
01:20:04.090 --> 01:20:05.634
The fact that I don't have
an art career anymore.

1392
01:20:05.634 --> 01:20:06.426
Bullshit!

1393
01:20:13.433 --> 01:20:14.768
- It's you.

1394
01:20:14.768 --> 01:20:16.019
You're him.

1395
01:20:16.019 --> 01:20:18.814
It's been you this
whole entire time?

1396
01:20:18.814 --> 01:20:20.440
- Yeah. it's been me

1397
01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:21.983
but it's fucked now
because you had me

1398
01:20:21.983 --> 01:20:23.401
get that fucking phone!

1399
01:20:25.612 --> 01:20:27.197
My whole career's ruined now.

1400
01:20:28.615 --> 01:20:31.910
- Look. Ronnie. I
know who you are

1401
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:33.495
