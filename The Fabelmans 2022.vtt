3
00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:51.009
Mommy and Daddy
will be right next to you.

4
00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:52.552
The lights will go down.

5
00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:55.222
There may be some organ music
as the curtain opens.

6
00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:56.473
Don't be scared.

7
00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:58.392
It'll be dark in there.
you said.

8
00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:00.519
- I don't want to go in.
- But it's fun.

9
00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:02.271
All week.
you've been so excited.

10
00:01:02.271 --> 00:01:03.897
Your first ever movie.

11
00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:06.608
- And the people are gigantic.
- What people?

12
00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:09.236
You said the people
in the movie are gigantic.

13
00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:10.988
Oh. because of
the big screen they're on.

14
00:01:10.988 --> 00:01:12.864
but they're not real. uh. right?

15
00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:15.909
- They're like dreams.
- Dreams are scary.

16
00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.413
Some dreams are. but this is
gonna be a nice dream.

17
00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:22.874
About a circus and clowns
and acrobats and. um...

18
00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:24.376
You want to know how it works?

19
00:01:24.376 --> 00:01:26.420
There's a big machine
called a projector.

20
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.213
Inside. there's
a big bright light.

21
00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:29.756
and it projects photographs

22
00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:31.925
- of-of clowns and acrobats.
- And elephants.

23
00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:34.386
- Uh. "projecting" means it
sends them out. -Happy things.

24
00:01:34.386 --> 00:01:36.680
Happy things like light
from a huge flashlight.

25
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.516
But these photographs move past
the light really fast.

26
00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:41.435
24 photos in every second.

27
00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:43.020
Now. in your brain.

28
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.647
each photograph stays
for about a 15th of a second.

29
00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:48.191
That's called
persistence of vision.

30
00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:49.818
The photographs move past

31
00:01:49.818 --> 00:01:51.653
faster than your brain
can let go of them.

32
00:01:51.653 --> 00:01:53.655
and that's how
the movie projector tricks us

33
00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:57.034
into believing that
motionless pictures are moving.

34
00:01:57.034 --> 00:01:59.703
A motion picture.

35
00:01:59.703 --> 00:02:04.041
Movies are dreams. doll.
that you never forget.

36
00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:05.250
You just wait and see.

37
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.626
When it's over.
you're gonna have

38
00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:08.670
the biggest. sloppiest smile
on your face.

39
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.672
- They're letting us in.

40
00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:26.980
Wait till the engines pass.

41
00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:43.413
- Unlock the door.

42
00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:48.085
Pass it down.

43
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:53.173
- What's that?
- Second section.

44
00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:58.011
Angel. She's on that train.

45
00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:00.013
So what? We got the
dough. Let's get out of here.

46
00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:02.557
Lights. I must turn the lights
down the track.

47
00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:04.351
You crazy lunkhead.
Give me that wheel.

48
00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:07.104
We are going to--
down the track!

49
00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.441
The train! Stop the train!

50
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:13.193
Stop the train!

51
00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.197
Stop! Can't you see the lights?!

52
00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:18.490
Stop!

53
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.035
First section! Hold it!

54
00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:25.747
- Angel! Angel!

55
00:03:48.145 --> 00:03:50.397
What was your favorite part?

56
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:57.320
Sammy. what do you want
for Hanukkah?

57
00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.698
I told you
this wasn't a good idea.

58
00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:02.576
what with all of his
A-N-X-I-E-T-I-E-S.

59
00:04:02.576 --> 00:04:04.619
Kids his age have big
I-M-A-G-I-N-A-T-I-O-N-S.

60
00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:08.540
No fair spelling out
the long words.

61
00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:13.295
The lights change
how everything looks.

62
00:04:13.295 --> 00:04:14.713
It's hard to find our house.

63
00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:17.257
Ours is the dark house
with no lights.

64
00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:30.187
That's what I want for Hanukkah.

65
00:04:30.187 --> 00:04:32.105
- What?
- Christmas lights!

66
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.733
Sorry. dolly.

67
00:04:34.733 --> 00:04:37.110
Jews don't get Christmas lights.

68
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.945
Eight nights of candlelight.

69
00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:49.998
Can I sleep
with the oscilloscope?

70
00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:05.680
Get going.
We got to burn rubber.

71
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.015
- What's that?
-Second section.

72
00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:08.642
Angel. She's on that train.

73
00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:10.060
-The lights.

74
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.603
I must turn the lights
down the track.

75
00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:12.646
-Stop the train!

76
00:05:12.646 --> 00:05:13.855
Stop the train!

77
00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:15.607
-Angel!

78
00:05:17.776 --> 00:05:21.446
Mommy! Mommy!

79
00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:25.283
I know what I want for Hanukkah!

80
00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:27.327
I know what I want
for Hanukkah!

81
00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:40.423
...Hanukkah!

82
00:05:42.217 --> 00:05:44.010
Thank you!

83
00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:48.932
Sammy.

84
00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:51.184
-Oh. my God.
- Whoa.

85
00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:53.019
I'm so excited.

86
00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:34.728
Okay. so the outside grounds.
the middle conducts the power.

87
00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:37.063
and these two metal wheels
under the engine

88
00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:38.607
complete the circuit.

89
00:06:38.607 --> 00:06:41.735
So. new. Mr. Engineer?

90
00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:44.404
RCA gave you a raise?

91
00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:47.032
That is
one expensive trolley car.

92
00:06:47.032 --> 00:06:48.908
It's not a trolley car.
It's a Lionel train.

93
00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:51.036
No raises for the computer guys
this year.

94
00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:52.120
Next year. maybe.

95
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.580
Your moonlighting son
is paying for it

96
00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.790
by filling up my house
with broken TVs.

97
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.251
Repair work. that's how.

98
00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:01.421
Oy. careful he doesn't
electrocute himself.

99
00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:05.300
- Hold on.
- You're okay.

100
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.886
You're not taking that fancy
train to Florida without me.

101
00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:09.554
Hey. look.

102
00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:11.681
She's down on the floor.

103
00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:13.683
Who's gonna help her up?

104
00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:15.268
Who says I'm getting up?

105
00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:19.064
I'm going to Miami
on the Sammy Limited.

106
00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:20.940
Go ahead.

107
00:07:22.651 --> 00:07:24.110
- Ooh.

108
00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:33.596
I precisely engineer toys.

109
00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:35.098
You can play with them

110
00:08:35.098 --> 00:08:36.474
when you've learned
to treat them with respect.

111
00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:38.768
I do respect them. I love them.

112
00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:40.603
I know you do. but you can't
just love something.

113
00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:43.273
You also have to
take care of it. right?

114
00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:50.530
Maybe we can play together
with them this weekend.

115
00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:01.124
But I need to see them crash.

116
00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:06.171
I don't understand.

117
00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:08.882
Why does he need
to see them crash?

118
00:09:13.052 --> 00:09:14.220
It's late.

119
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.764
You don't want
to shut your light?

120
00:09:15.764 --> 00:09:16.931
Mm. In a minute.

121
00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:19.559
I'm still wide-awake.

122
00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:22.061
You see these descending notes?

123
00:09:22.061 --> 00:09:24.689
That's called a lament bass.

124
00:09:27.484 --> 00:09:30.236
You should play it on the radio
on that arts program.

125
00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:32.113
- Oh. -They keep
asking you to go back.

126
00:09:32.113 --> 00:09:33.907
I don't have time for that. Mm.

127
00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:35.784
Well. we can hire a sitter.

128
00:09:35.784 --> 00:09:37.076
Who can afford that? Forget it.

129
00:09:37.076 --> 00:09:39.287
That was another life.

130
00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:41.581
That was two kids ago.

131
00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:49.964
You know what I miss most
about the piano?

132
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.969
Surrendering to the score.

133
00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:59.599
Knowing Bach is
gonna tell you how--

134
00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:02.018
First this note.
then this chord.

135
00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:06.606
then you open your hand.
you stretch down an octave...

136
00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:20.078
Making a little world
you can be safe and happy in.

137
00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:28.378
Thank you.

138
00:10:37.011 --> 00:10:40.640
That's why he needs
to watch them crash.

139
00:10:41.975 --> 00:10:46.187
He's trying to get
some kind of control over it.

140
00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:54.404
Sammy?

141
00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:59.033
We're going to use
Daddy's camera to film it.

142
00:10:59.033 --> 00:11:01.286
Only crash the train once. okay?

143
00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:02.996
Then. after we get
the film developed.

144
00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:04.497
you can watch it crash
over and over

145
00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:06.833
till it's not so scary anymore.

146
00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:09.419
And your real train
won't ever get broken.

147
00:11:11.588 --> 00:11:14.424
One more thing. dolly.

148
00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:17.051
Let's not tell your father.

149
00:11:17.051 --> 00:11:20.388
It'll be our secret movie.
just yours and mine.

150
00:11:22.348 --> 00:11:24.392
- Okay?
- Okay.

151
00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:26.769
Sorry I'm late.

152
00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:28.813
I picked up
Ms. Moynahan's Motorola.

153
00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:30.356
There's no room left
in the workshop.

154
00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:32.358
- Where should I put it?
- The living room. I guess?

155
00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:34.193
Okay.

156
00:11:34.193 --> 00:11:37.071
Hey. uh. sorry I'm late.
I picked up Mrs. Fabelman.

157
00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:38.364
Where should I put her?

158
00:11:40.158 --> 00:11:42.452
Ow! Ow. ow. ow.

159
00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:44.787
- Did the mail come?
- It's on the table.

160
00:11:47.206 --> 00:11:48.791
Cossack.

161
00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:08.895
- This is brisket?
- My movie!

162
00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.732
Ah. ah. ah. ah. ah. ah. ah.

163
00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:14.317
After supper.

164
00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:17.195
The amount of magnetism
is increased by

165
00:12:17.195 --> 00:12:19.447
how magnetically permeable
the core material is.

166
00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:21.908
The tricky thing is
how permeable we can make it.

167
00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:24.369
Am I supposed to be
following any of this?

168
00:12:24.369 --> 00:12:26.913
You know what
a magnetic field is. right?

169
00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:29.958
Uh. yeah. Well. sure.
I mean. it...

170
00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.168
Sammy. do you know
what a magnetic field is?

171
00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:33.920
- Can I be excused?
- Nope.

172
00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.755
But I need to.
just for a minute.

173
00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:37.423
- What's so urgent?
- Honey.

174
00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:39.258
This tastes funny. Burt.

175
00:12:39.258 --> 00:12:41.511
It tastes funny
on a plastic fork.

176
00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:44.597
- Ma.
- Is she saving the silverware

177
00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.808
for when the Eisenhowers
drop by?

178
00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:48.434
The problem is
we're using vacuum tubes.

179
00:12:48.434 --> 00:12:50.269
not transistors.
and magnetic cores

180
00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:53.106
- to try to access memory...
- 35.000 magnetic cores.

181
00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:54.941
Hey. Sam. you know
on your father's camera

182
00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:56.192
when the film runs out?

183
00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:57.777
When that happens.
what do you do?

184
00:12:57.777 --> 00:12:59.612
- Load more film.
- The same with computers.

185
00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:01.614
You have to load more tape. and
that slows everything down...

186
00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:03.449
Mitz. the chopped liver
was beyond belief.

187
00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:05.243
- ...load it with data.

188
00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:07.412
and instead of changing tapes
every ten seconds.

189
00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:09.122
this new machine
he's engineering...

190
00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:11.582
- The BIZMAC!
- The BIZMAC!

191
00:13:11.582 --> 00:13:13.584
It can search for information

192
00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:14.877
through all these tapes at once.

193
00:13:14.877 --> 00:13:16.129
You never need
to change any of them.

194
00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:17.255
It'll be ten times faster.

195
00:13:17.255 --> 00:13:20.258
I love Burt's brain.

196
00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:23.469
Especially when you're around
to explain what's in it.

197
00:13:27.765 --> 00:13:29.017
Mom. I have to go upstairs now.

198
00:13:29.017 --> 00:13:30.727
Not until
you've finished eating.

199
00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:31.853
He cleaned his plate.

200
00:13:31.853 --> 00:13:33.312
No. he didn't.

201
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.982
- Sammy.

202
00:13:35.982 --> 00:13:37.900
Hey. Natalie. I think there's
something under your plate.

203
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.110
- Sammy.
- No. there isn't.

204
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:40.069
Lift it up and check.

205
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:41.446
I saw it moving.

206
00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:51.664
Licorice.

207
00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:53.916
If there's anything
I'm a sucker for.

208
00:13:53.916 --> 00:13:54.917
it's licorice.

209
00:13:57.128 --> 00:14:00.048
Uncle Bennie.
that was so disgusting!

210
00:14:00.048 --> 00:14:03.134
- No. no!
- Natalie. he is not your uncle.

211
00:14:03.134 --> 00:14:05.553
Also. he is not that funny.

212
00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:08.681
Oh. "uncle" is a term
of affection.

213
00:14:08.681 --> 00:14:11.309
Natalie. he's not related.

214
00:14:11.309 --> 00:14:16.189
He's only always here
because he works for my son.

215
00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:19.108
He's only always here because
he's my best friend.

216
00:14:19.108 --> 00:14:21.360
And deep down inside you.
Mrs. Fabelman.

217
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.488
admit it. I'm your friend. too.

218
00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:27.408
Deep down inside of me
is none of your business.

219
00:14:28.534 --> 00:14:29.994
Sid Caesar's on tonight.

220
00:14:29.994 --> 00:14:32.038
Help me.

221
00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:34.540
- Natalie. get that corner.
- What?

222
00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.958
Get the corner. Get the corner.

223
00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.710
Can I help you take it out?

224
00:14:57.396 --> 00:14:59.273
Sammy.

225
00:15:37.728 --> 00:15:40.439
I had to crash it
a whole lot of times.

226
00:15:40.439 --> 00:15:43.568
- but the train never got hurt.
-Golly.

227
00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.780
I thought that was
The Greatest Show on Earth.

228
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:52.702
Oh. more.
more. more. more. more.

229
00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.413
Head back. Open.

230
00:15:55.413 --> 00:15:58.207
- Ah.
- Candy corn in.

231
00:15:58.207 --> 00:16:00.626
- Say. "Ah."

232
00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:02.253
Head back.

233
00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:06.132
- Ketchup. Okay.

234
00:16:06.132 --> 00:16:07.508
Scream like it hurts.

235
00:16:07.508 --> 00:16:09.093
Pull it!

236
00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:24.859
Sammy!

237
00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:28.321
Oh.

238
00:17:05.733 --> 00:17:07.777
Take off the blindfolds.

239
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:19.789
Sammy?

240
00:17:20.539 --> 00:17:23.376
Reggie. Natalie.
come downstairs pronto.

241
00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:26.545
Your father has an announcement.

242
00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:31.050
General Electric
wants to hire me

243
00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.469
because of what I did on BIZMAC.

244
00:17:33.469 --> 00:17:36.764
They want to use my
electronic library system to--

245
00:17:36.764 --> 00:17:38.724
Well. I-I don't think
they have any notion

246
00:17:38.724 --> 00:17:40.017
of what I can do with it.

247
00:17:40.017 --> 00:17:42.228
And I'll make more money.

248
00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:44.063
Is Uncle Bennie coming. too?

249
00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:46.649
Well. D-Daddy and me
haven't had a chance to think

250
00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:49.402
- about Uncle Bennie. but...
- Bennie. no. He lives here.

251
00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:53.322
Burt.

252
00:17:56.325 --> 00:17:57.910
I'll miss
your Uncle Bennie. too.

253
00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:00.621
but Phoenix is a real neat city.

254
00:18:00.621 --> 00:18:02.123
It's on the rise.

255
00:18:02.123 --> 00:18:04.500
They've only just hired me.
I've got no pull there yet.

256
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.377
I can't ask General Electric

257
00:18:06.377 --> 00:18:08.087
to hire somebody else
on my say-so.

258
00:18:08.087 --> 00:18:09.922
- That's not how it works.
- Don't ask them.

259
00:18:09.922 --> 00:18:11.924
Do it yourself.
They're hiring you to manage.

260
00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:14.010
Managers hire. Hire Bennie.

261
00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:15.720
Uh. who's watching-- Sammy!

262
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.596
- He's got to make a name for
himself at RCA. -

263
00:18:17.596 --> 00:18:19.348
- Come here. Come here.
-That's what I did.

264
00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:20.725
He'll stay in New Jersey.

265
00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:22.560
get out from
under my shadow and then...

266
00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.228
There's a tornado outside!

267
00:18:24.228 --> 00:18:25.855
Yeah. well.
there's a bigger one in here.

268
00:18:25.855 --> 00:18:28.774
Honestly. honestly. Burt.
sometimes I want to shake you.

269
00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:31.610
You're-you're gonna leave him
behind with just a-a shrug?

270
00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:33.195
Mommy! Mommy!
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

271
00:18:33.195 --> 00:18:34.864
"We'll see ya later."

272
00:18:34.864 --> 00:18:37.700
And once we're gone. who will
he have left in New Jersey?

273
00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.535
You have an opportunity
to help your best friend.

274
00:18:39.535 --> 00:18:41.078
- Mommy. look!
- Mommy! Mommy!

275
00:18:41.078 --> 00:18:42.455
- Honestly. wake up.
- Mom! Mom!

276
00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:44.999
- What?! -Look!
There's a tornado outside.

277
00:18:44.999 --> 00:18:46.709
- I'm scared.
- Just go.

278
00:18:48.919 --> 00:18:51.964
Wow! Ah!

279
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.344
Oh!

280
00:19:00.264 --> 00:19:02.141
You weren't kidding!

281
00:19:03.434 --> 00:19:05.478
How close is it?

282
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.191
Why does the sky look orange?

283
00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:12.985
Come on!

284
00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:14.695
Come on. Let's go see.

285
00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:18.616
- Get in. get in!
- Get in!

286
00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:21.744
Mitz? Where are you going?

287
00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:25.164
Mitz. where are--

288
00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:27.833
- Hey!

289
00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:29.919
Where are you going?

290
00:19:32.755 --> 00:19:34.006
Mitz!

291
00:19:36.717 --> 00:19:38.427
Mitzi!

292
00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:45.851
Where is it?

293
00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:47.395
- I can't see it anymore.

294
00:19:47.395 --> 00:19:49.188
Up ahead somewhere.
We'll find it.

295
00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:51.857
Mom. it's there. It's there!

296
00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:58.155
- Is this s-safe?

297
00:19:58.155 --> 00:20:00.825
Of course it's safe.
I'm your mother.

298
00:20:03.369 --> 00:20:05.079
Mom. stop!

299
00:20:29.437 --> 00:20:31.480
Everything happens for a reason.

300
00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.567
Everything happens
for a reason.

301
00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:37.445
Everything happens for a reason.

302
00:20:38.237 --> 00:20:40.239
Say it with me.

303
00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:42.658
Everything happens
for a reason.

304
00:20:42.658 --> 00:20:46.245
Everything happens for a reason.

305
00:20:46.245 --> 00:20:49.039
Everything happens
for a reason.

306
00:20:49.039 --> 00:20:51.125
Everything happens for a reason.

307
00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.604
I think there's
something dead in the road.

308
00:21:19.778 --> 00:21:22.448
- Reggie. wave in the camera.

309
00:21:45.888 --> 00:21:48.474
- Ooh. look.
- There it is!

310
00:21:48.474 --> 00:21:49.934
- There it is. Wow.

311
00:21:49.934 --> 00:21:51.852
Whoa!

312
00:21:51.852 --> 00:21:53.896
Let me out. I want to take
a shot of him pulling in.

313
00:21:53.896 --> 00:21:55.606
- No!
- No. I have to pee now!

314
00:21:55.606 --> 00:21:57.483
Me. too! Now! No!

315
00:22:02.905 --> 00:22:05.574
No! I have to pee!

316
00:22:05.574 --> 00:22:07.368
- Keep coming.
- No!

317
00:22:09.328 --> 00:22:11.789
Keep coming. Dad.
You're doing great.

318
00:22:14.124 --> 00:22:18.045
And...

319
00:22:18.045 --> 00:22:20.297
Stop.

320
00:22:20.297 --> 00:22:21.882
Freeze.

321
00:22:30.432 --> 00:22:31.850
- Where's the lunch box?
- Wow.

322
00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:33.394
Where's the lunch box?! Hurry!

323
00:22:33.394 --> 00:22:35.020
Guys. look at the monster
Sammy caught.

324
00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.730
I got the babies.

325
00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.732
- Sal found babies.
- Look at that.

326
00:22:38.732 --> 00:22:39.858
Sammy. Dean. come on.

327
00:22:39.858 --> 00:22:41.527
There's a huge nest right there.

328
00:22:41.527 --> 00:22:43.445
- Come on. guys.
- A big one. Sammy.

329
00:22:43.445 --> 00:22:45.322
- Oh. God.
- Oh!

330
00:22:45.322 --> 00:22:46.657
It's a whole herd of 'em.

331
00:22:46.657 --> 00:22:47.908
Scorpions come in nests.

332
00:22:47.908 --> 00:22:49.577
No. actually.
it's a bed of scorpions.

333
00:22:49.577 --> 00:22:51.870
- No. it's a nest.

334
00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:54.081
The baby scorpions
are called "scorplings."

335
00:22:54.081 --> 00:22:55.332
They're twice as venomous.

336
00:22:55.332 --> 00:22:56.542
That's-that's why
the lab pays more.

337
00:22:56.542 --> 00:22:58.085
There's got to be
like 50 of 'em.

338
00:22:58.085 --> 00:22:59.295
Well. how much is the
laboratory gonna pay for them?

339
00:22:59.295 --> 00:23:00.713
50 cents per baby.

340
00:23:00.713 --> 00:23:03.173
- That's 25 bucks!
- We're rich. -

341
00:23:03.173 --> 00:23:05.509
Well. what are we gonna buy?

342
00:23:08.012 --> 00:23:09.471
12 dollars even.

343
00:23:10.222 --> 00:23:13.309
Well. it's the merit badge
for photography. not movies.

344
00:23:13.309 --> 00:23:15.811
The manual says you got to tell
a story with still pictures.

345
00:23:15.811 --> 00:23:17.688
Yeah. but all a movie is
is still pictures.

346
00:23:17.688 --> 00:23:19.565
You just put a bunch of them
together and they move.

347
00:23:19.565 --> 00:23:22.067
Okay. but what kind of movie
are we making?

348
00:23:22.067 --> 00:23:24.695
Ooh. Sammy. look.
It's Janet Benedict.

349
00:23:27.906 --> 00:23:29.950
Hey. go on and talk to her.
I dare you.

350
00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:31.410
He already talked to her.

351
00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:32.995
- No way.
- Like hell.

352
00:23:32.995 --> 00:23:34.913
No way.
He actually spoke to her?

353
00:23:34.913 --> 00:23:37.082
He did. He did.
He walked right up to her.

354
00:23:37.082 --> 00:23:38.584
- And he...
- You went up to Janet Benedict?

355
00:23:38.584 --> 00:23:40.002
- What did you say to her?
- Nothing.

356
00:23:40.002 --> 00:23:41.629
Oh. come on.
Tell them what happened. Sammy.

357
00:23:41.629 --> 00:23:42.880
Nothing happened.

358
00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.424
Something happened. Come on.

359
00:23:45.424 --> 00:23:47.801
Could be the same one.

360
00:23:48.969 --> 00:23:51.889
"Overland." Say. I think
it is the same one.

361
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.433
Well. I declare.

362
00:23:58.187 --> 00:23:59.647
So. uh.

363
00:23:59.647 --> 00:24:02.816
Sammy kind of sidewinds his way
in her direction.

364
00:24:02.816 --> 00:24:05.069
And he's trying to. um...
he-he's trying to work up

365
00:24:05.069 --> 00:24:07.655
the nerve to say something
slick and smooth like.

366
00:24:07.655 --> 00:24:09.573
-"Hey. Jan. baby."
- No. I wasn't.

367
00:24:09.573 --> 00:24:11.158
- You're making this up.

368
00:24:11.158 --> 00:24:13.577
But-but he sees that Janet's
got something on her nose.

369
00:24:13.577 --> 00:24:14.870
So now he's thinking. "Cool.

370
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:16.538
Here's my excuse to go up
and talk to her."

371
00:24:16.538 --> 00:24:19.917
So he goes and he says. "Hey.
uh. sorry. Janet.

372
00:24:19.917 --> 00:24:22.211
It-it looks like you have
a little smudge on your nose."

373
00:24:22.211 --> 00:24:24.046
- Shut up. Hark.
- But it wasn't a smudge.

374
00:24:24.046 --> 00:24:25.964
- It looked like a smudge.
- And it wasn't little.

375
00:24:25.964 --> 00:24:27.549
Hark. shut up!

376
00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:30.469
- It was a booger!

377
00:24:30.469 --> 00:24:31.929
A big. fat.

378
00:24:31.929 --> 00:24:33.931
- Janet Benedict booger.

379
00:24:36.517 --> 00:24:38.811
It was huge.

380
00:24:43.607 --> 00:24:44.817
Hey. Sammy.

381
00:24:44.817 --> 00:24:46.610
Stand and deliver.

382
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:49.238
What kind of movie
are we gonna make?

383
00:24:49.988 --> 00:24:53.283
Stand and deliver.

384
00:24:55.077 --> 00:24:56.829
No. keep screaming.
Keep screaming.

385
00:25:00.124 --> 00:25:02.167
I need more dust. Dad. can you
grab the sandwich board?

386
00:25:02.167 --> 00:25:04.753
No. no. God. no.
no more dust. No.

387
00:25:04.753 --> 00:25:06.296
Reggie. stop coughing!

388
00:25:06.296 --> 00:25:08.173
- I'm coughing
because there's dust. -Okay.

389
00:25:08.173 --> 00:25:09.883
- More dust. fellas. -Natalie.
say. "Please don't kill me."

390
00:25:09.883 --> 00:25:10.884
- All right.
- Reggie. stop coughing.

391
00:25:10.884 --> 00:25:12.511
You're being dramatic.

392
00:25:12.511 --> 00:25:14.012
Mr. Fabelman. you're getting
dirt inside my stagecoach.

393
00:25:14.012 --> 00:25:15.848
Don't you want me
to be dramatic?

394
00:25:15.848 --> 00:25:17.141
- Don't look into the camera.
- Well. we'll clean it out.

395
00:25:17.141 --> 00:25:18.642
Guys. stop looking
into the camera.

396
00:25:18.642 --> 00:25:20.352
- I can't use any of this.
-Dad!

397
00:26:11.695 --> 00:26:13.071
Fake.

398
00:26:15.115 --> 00:26:16.658
Totally fake.

399
00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:08.252
- You hear it?

400
00:27:08.252 --> 00:27:10.170
She has got to cut
those goddamn fingernails

401
00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:11.964
before she goes
on live television.

402
00:27:11.964 --> 00:27:14.550
- I have to perform this
tomorrow. -

403
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:16.510
It's a difficult piece.

404
00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:18.220
It's a very big deal for me.

405
00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.639
All I asked was for you
to keep your big traps shut

406
00:27:20.639 --> 00:27:23.475
and listen
to my dress rehearsal.

407
00:27:23.475 --> 00:27:24.893
Sorry. Mitz. It's wonderful.

408
00:27:24.893 --> 00:27:26.311
You hear how
the rising arpeggios

409
00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:28.021
- lift up the sad notes?

410
00:27:28.021 --> 00:27:30.524
It's in F minor. but your mom
makes it sound so alive.

411
00:27:30.524 --> 00:27:32.568
She makes it sound like
she's playing a typewriter.

412
00:27:33.569 --> 00:27:35.445
Oh. no.

413
00:27:35.445 --> 00:27:36.780
Not this again.

414
00:27:42.035 --> 00:27:43.829
Do you hear it? Am I clicking?

415
00:27:43.829 --> 00:27:46.081
I concentrate
on your playing. but...

416
00:27:46.081 --> 00:27:47.666
Bu-- Oh. great. But what?

417
00:27:47.666 --> 00:27:49.084
But people can hear it
in Tucson.

418
00:27:49.084 --> 00:27:50.002
- Maybe I've gotten used to it.

419
00:27:50.002 --> 00:27:51.003
Maybe GE should make

420
00:27:51.003 --> 00:27:52.170
rubber tips for fingernails.

421
00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:54.673
All right. Mitzi Fabelman.

422
00:27:54.673 --> 00:27:56.300
Time to face the music.

423
00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.010
- Oh. boy.

424
00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:59.761
You stay away from me
with those things.

425
00:27:59.761 --> 00:28:01.346
- It's Beethoven. damn it.
- No. no. no!

426
00:28:01.346 --> 00:28:03.015
- It is not Morse code. Come on.
- No! Stop! Stop! Stop it!

427
00:28:03.015 --> 00:28:04.516
He has a point. though.
especially with

428
00:28:04.516 --> 00:28:06.184
the polydirectional
ribbon microphones

429
00:28:06.184 --> 00:28:07.436
- they have on television
stage... -

430
00:28:09.897 --> 00:28:11.481
Come on. You married her.

431
00:28:11.481 --> 00:28:12.858
Dad. don't.

432
00:28:12.858 --> 00:28:14.192
Do it. Do it.
Do it. Do it. Do it!

433
00:28:14.192 --> 00:28:15.986
I will scratch you.
Don't think I won't!

434
00:28:15.986 --> 00:28:17.654
Do you think Arthur Rubinstein

435
00:28:17.654 --> 00:28:19.072
- had fingernails?

436
00:28:19.072 --> 00:28:20.616
- Horowitz? Schnabel?
- Do not think about it.

437
00:28:20.616 --> 00:28:22.034
- Kempff?
- No. no. no.

438
00:28:22.034 --> 00:28:23.785
- Liberace.
- No. no. no. no.

439
00:28:23.785 --> 00:28:24.953
- Not my nails.
- Come on. Fabelman.

440
00:28:24.953 --> 00:28:26.330
Show her
who's General Electric's

441
00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:27.956
- product design manager.
- No. my beautiful nails.

442
00:28:27.956 --> 00:28:30.500
I paid a buck 50
at the beauty parlor for these.

443
00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.419
Oh. no.

444
00:28:32.419 --> 00:28:36.882
- One. two. three.

445
00:28:39.718 --> 00:28:41.887
Get off of me. Delilah.

446
00:28:41.887 --> 00:28:43.430
- Delilah?
- Okay. the fun's over.

447
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:45.682
I'll do the rest myself.

448
00:28:50.938 --> 00:28:53.523
Oh.

449
00:28:53.523 --> 00:28:54.858
Oh. great.

450
00:28:54.858 --> 00:28:57.194
Just great.
Well. that decides it.

451
00:28:57.194 --> 00:28:59.613
I'm gonna play the program
from memory tomorrow.

452
00:28:59.613 --> 00:29:04.326
No sheet music. short nails.
like a real performing artist.

453
00:29:53.041 --> 00:29:54.626
Did you drop your gun?

454
00:29:54.626 --> 00:29:55.669
Come on.

455
00:30:06.972 --> 00:30:08.557
That's me.

456
00:30:12.144 --> 00:30:13.895
Real scary. Sheriff.

457
00:30:23.238 --> 00:30:25.365
- Whoa.

458
00:30:38.295 --> 00:30:40.255
- Whoa.

459
00:30:43.759 --> 00:30:46.094
H-How'd you do that?

460
00:30:48.764 --> 00:30:50.390
How'd you do that?

461
00:31:08.742 --> 00:31:10.786
- Whoa!

462
00:31:21.671 --> 00:31:23.507
Go. Sammy!

463
00:31:26.885 --> 00:31:28.887
It's kind of like what I do.
isn't it.

464
00:31:28.887 --> 00:31:31.098
what a movie director does?

465
00:31:31.098 --> 00:31:32.432
- It is?
- I figure out

466
00:31:32.432 --> 00:31:34.226
what my division
needs to accomplish.

467
00:31:34.226 --> 00:31:37.521
then I work out how my guys
are gonna get it done.

468
00:31:38.396 --> 00:31:40.607
Yeah. it is. Yeah. sort of.

469
00:31:40.607 --> 00:31:43.360
How'd you make it look like
the guns were really firing?

470
00:31:45.654 --> 00:31:47.405
I did it with pins.

471
00:31:47.405 --> 00:31:48.740
Pins.

472
00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:51.076
Yeah. I poked holes
in the film with pins.

473
00:31:51.076 --> 00:31:52.786
- Sammy.
- Yeah.

474
00:31:52.786 --> 00:31:54.371
Thinking like an engineer.

475
00:31:54.371 --> 00:31:56.248
Watch the road. Dad.

476
00:31:57.999 --> 00:31:59.709
Sammy. watch the road.

477
00:31:59.709 --> 00:32:01.294
I can't edit
without an editing machine.

478
00:32:01.294 --> 00:32:03.588
I have to be able
to cut and splice. and I...

479
00:32:03.588 --> 00:32:06.216
Let's revisit it
after the camping trip.

480
00:32:06.216 --> 00:32:08.468
It's three hours
to the national forest.

481
00:32:08.468 --> 00:32:11.680
If you get your license.
you can help with the driving.

482
00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.056
Okay.

483
00:32:14.683 --> 00:32:16.726
"You are approaching
a railroad crossing

484
00:32:16.726 --> 00:32:18.937
"with no warning devices
and limited visibility.

485
00:32:18.937 --> 00:32:20.438
The speed limit is..."

486
00:32:20.438 --> 00:32:22.023
See. the thing is. though.
about my new movie.

487
00:32:22.023 --> 00:32:23.900
is that it's just...

488
00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:26.444
It's about World War II.
your war.

489
00:32:26.444 --> 00:32:27.946
It's gonna be. like.
out of this world.

490
00:32:27.946 --> 00:32:29.239
I'm shooting on a Bolex H8.

491
00:32:29.239 --> 00:32:30.699
Finally. I can use
double run film.

492
00:32:30.699 --> 00:32:31.908
You know. that's six minutes

493
00:32:31.908 --> 00:32:33.285
without having to
change the reel.

494
00:32:33.285 --> 00:32:35.453
How much did you spend
to rent this camera?

495
00:32:36.288 --> 00:32:38.290
- 20 bucks. But I used
my own money. -

496
00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:39.624
- You don't have to...

497
00:32:39.624 --> 00:32:41.835
And this movie editor
gizmo costs?

498
00:32:41.835 --> 00:32:44.379
It's a Mansfield
eight millimeter movie editor.

499
00:32:44.379 --> 00:32:46.548
How much?

500
00:32:46.548 --> 00:32:48.800
- 80 bucks.
- Doggone it. Sammy!

501
00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.136
A hundred dollars for a hobby?

502
00:32:51.136 --> 00:32:52.762
It's not a hobby. Dad.

503
00:32:52.762 --> 00:32:54.556
If you spent half the time
on algebra that you spend on

504
00:32:54.556 --> 00:32:56.516
- these movies. you could get...
- Algebra? I hate algebra.

505
00:32:56.516 --> 00:32:58.393
Why are you...

506
00:32:58.393 --> 00:32:59.978
It's completely pointless.

507
00:32:59.978 --> 00:33:02.022
Not if you want to make
something. it's not pointless.

508
00:33:02.022 --> 00:33:04.816
Gee. Sammy. when I was a boy.
I always used to think.

509
00:33:04.816 --> 00:33:07.110
-"Somebody figured out
how to make this." -Yeah.

510
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:08.486
- This car...
- Uh-huh.

511
00:33:08.486 --> 00:33:10.864
...that rearview mirror.
that directional signal.

512
00:33:10.864 --> 00:33:12.949
I want to make movies. though.

513
00:33:12.949 --> 00:33:15.869
I mean something real.

514
00:33:15.869 --> 00:33:18.205
Not imaginary.

515
00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:22.667
Something someone can
actually use.

516
00:33:24.044 --> 00:33:26.880
Like a driver's license.

517
00:33:27.797 --> 00:33:30.217
I'm gonna vomit. Sammy!
I'm gonna vomit!

518
00:33:30.217 --> 00:33:31.509
Sammy. please pull over.

519
00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:33.053
She's gonna puke all over me.

520
00:33:33.053 --> 00:33:35.513
--Go slower.
You are the worst driver.

521
00:33:35.513 --> 00:33:37.224
You're gonna break the car.

522
00:33:37.224 --> 00:33:39.643
We're on a back road going
three miles per hour.

523
00:33:39.643 --> 00:33:41.853
- Calm down.
- You're doing great. doll.

524
00:33:41.853 --> 00:33:42.938
You're doing very well.

525
00:33:42.938 --> 00:33:44.606
Okay. watch out.
Puddle up ahead.

526
00:33:52.697 --> 00:33:54.616
- So we've got three

527
00:33:54.616 --> 00:33:56.534
that are strong and still green
inside. so they don't burn.

528
00:33:56.534 --> 00:33:58.578
Bright green means
that they're still alive

529
00:33:58.578 --> 00:34:00.538
and that they carry moisture.

530
00:34:00.538 --> 00:34:03.792
And the reason that we use
the shape of the triangle

531
00:34:03.792 --> 00:34:06.378
is that when
these three points connect.

532
00:34:06.378 --> 00:34:09.047
if we find the center
of gravitational force.

533
00:34:09.047 --> 00:34:11.383
it creates
almost perfect balance.

534
00:34:11.383 --> 00:34:13.343
- Whew. Oh. -Because I'm Tutti.
and you're Frutti.

535
00:34:13.343 --> 00:34:15.679
So who else
are you gonna listen to?

536
00:34:17.806 --> 00:34:19.099
Okay.

537
00:34:19.099 --> 00:34:20.058
- ...the pyramids. right?

538
00:34:21.393 --> 00:34:22.644
- Guys. come on!
- I mean. the history

539
00:34:22.644 --> 00:34:24.062
- behind this shape...

540
00:34:24.062 --> 00:34:26.231
- Ah. Oh!
- ...is pretty in--

541
00:34:26.231 --> 00:34:27.983
- is pretty incredible.

542
00:34:27.983 --> 00:34:30.026
Oh. hello!

543
00:34:30.026 --> 00:34:31.736
- Uh...
- Hi!

544
00:34:33.154 --> 00:34:34.739
Wait. Let me try it...

545
00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:37.075
- Let me try it like this.
- Okay. one more time.

546
00:34:37.075 --> 00:34:38.535
- Yeah. after one more time.
- Okay.

547
00:34:38.535 --> 00:34:40.036
-Ready?
- Hey.

548
00:34:40.036 --> 00:34:41.788
Girls. I'm gonna start the fire!

549
00:34:41.788 --> 00:34:45.166
- Three. two. one!
- Okay. Really big. really big!

550
00:34:45.166 --> 00:34:47.460
- Go! Whoa!

551
00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.045
I thought it was gonna break.

552
00:34:49.045 --> 00:34:50.463
Oh. It's-it's happening!

553
00:34:50.463 --> 00:34:52.215
You almost broke it in half.

554
00:35:49.981 --> 00:35:52.359
- Heart attack!

555
00:35:53.818 --> 00:35:56.029
- We'll take a schvitz
and have a... -

556
00:35:56.029 --> 00:35:57.280
- Shmitz.
- And eat some...

557
00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.698
Schnitzelpitz.

558
00:35:58.698 --> 00:36:00.700
- And drink slivovitz.
- And we'll lose our wits.

559
00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:02.577
- And we'll get the shits!
- And have...

560
00:36:02.577 --> 00:36:04.537
- Whoa!

561
00:36:06.539 --> 00:36:08.458
- -Wait.

562
00:36:10.543 --> 00:36:13.004
- Exactly!

563
00:36:24.641 --> 00:36:26.434
They're gonna know
that kind of FPU

564
00:36:26.434 --> 00:36:27.894
is not for
industrial process control.

565
00:36:27.894 --> 00:36:29.687
and it will raise
every red flag there is.

566
00:36:29.687 --> 00:36:31.689
- How many bits?
- Float64.

567
00:36:31.689 --> 00:36:33.024
64 bits?

568
00:36:33.024 --> 00:36:34.317
Sixty-- You are nuts.

569
00:36:34.317 --> 00:36:36.528
And time-sharing
for 11 operators?

570
00:36:36.528 --> 00:36:38.238
They're gonna know
this is a business machine

571
00:36:38.238 --> 00:36:40.865
- we're building. and we're
all gonna get fired. -

572
00:36:40.865 --> 00:36:42.325
No.

573
00:36:42.325 --> 00:36:43.618
Yes!

574
00:36:43.618 --> 00:36:45.203
GE doesn't build
business computers.

575
00:36:45.203 --> 00:36:46.538
We do heavy industry processing.

576
00:36:46.538 --> 00:36:47.956
You got that
straight from the CEO.

577
00:36:47.956 --> 00:36:49.707
Ralph Cordiner is gonna
skin you alive.

578
00:36:49.707 --> 00:36:52.627
Once Bank of America buys in.
this will be profitable.

579
00:36:52.627 --> 00:36:55.213
and that's Mr. Cordiner's job.
making money.

580
00:36:55.213 --> 00:36:56.548
My job is getting Raytheon

581
00:36:56.548 --> 00:36:59.217
to deliver
10.000 germanium transistors

582
00:36:59.217 --> 00:37:00.593
that meet
our tolerance standards.

583
00:37:00.593 --> 00:37:02.887
And your job is to get
the cabling diagrams

584
00:37:02.887 --> 00:37:04.806
to Pitney Bowes
so when the time comes.

585
00:37:04.806 --> 00:37:06.933
we have a sorter to hook up
to the mainframe.

586
00:37:06.933 --> 00:37:08.476
Well. maybe Pitney Bowes
will hire me

587
00:37:08.476 --> 00:37:09.561
after you get us both
canned from GE.

588
00:37:09.561 --> 00:37:11.229
Isn't it worth getting canned

589
00:37:11.229 --> 00:37:13.731
for the chance to build
a machine that can do all that?

590
00:37:13.731 --> 00:37:15.358
It's worth it to you. maybe!

591
00:37:15.358 --> 00:37:16.609
Sure as the Lord made
little green apples.

592
00:37:16.609 --> 00:37:18.194
California. here you come.

593
00:37:18.194 --> 00:37:19.571
IBM is waiting.

594
00:37:19.571 --> 00:37:21.072
Are we moving to California?

595
00:37:21.072 --> 00:37:22.490
- You are. any day now.
- No. no. no.

596
00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:24.033
What?

597
00:37:24.033 --> 00:37:25.618
IBM's asking.
and that's flattering. but...

598
00:37:25.618 --> 00:37:27.120
Flattering?
Flattering!

599
00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:29.122
Every guy in computer
would give his matzo balls

600
00:37:29.122 --> 00:37:30.582
to get an offer.

601
00:37:30.582 --> 00:37:32.125
You'll be in California

602
00:37:32.125 --> 00:37:34.752
building double-precision
auxiliary units with an FP64.

603
00:37:34.752 --> 00:37:37.088
I'm gonna be left
schvitzing in Arizona

604
00:37:37.088 --> 00:37:38.965
- making 40-watt light bulbs.
- Hold your horses.

605
00:37:38.965 --> 00:37:41.593
- Congruence? Come on. -I told
your mom it'll be up to her.

606
00:37:41.593 --> 00:37:44.345
I'm not uprooting us again
unless she says yes.

607
00:37:44.345 --> 00:37:49.893
Why would Mamaleh ever leave
all of this for California?

608
00:37:50.643 --> 00:37:53.188
- We have the Grand Canyon.

609
00:37:53.188 --> 00:37:56.274
They have the
San Andreas Fault.

610
00:37:57.317 --> 00:37:59.068
Mamaleh says...

611
00:37:59.068 --> 00:38:01.779
I will never leave Arizona.

612
00:38:01.779 --> 00:38:04.324
and Arizona will never leave me.

613
00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:10.455
Kids. avert your eyes.

614
00:38:29.641 --> 00:38:31.267
- Hey. man.
- Hmm?

615
00:38:31.267 --> 00:38:34.729
- Shouldn't you be filming this?
- Not enough light.

616
00:38:41.861 --> 00:38:45.698
GE. living better electrically!

617
00:39:04.926 --> 00:39:06.219
Mom?

618
00:39:06.219 --> 00:39:09.347
Mom. everyone can see
through your dress. Um...

619
00:39:12.517 --> 00:39:15.019
Reggie. get out of the way.

620
00:39:16.354 --> 00:39:18.398
Dad. can you please stop this?

621
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:21.401
- Come. Sit.
- No.

622
00:39:24.988 --> 00:39:27.240
Bennie. don't look!

623
00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:29.659
- Oh! You're all nuts!

624
00:40:26.966 --> 00:40:29.761
My mama's such a good mama.

625
00:40:36.559 --> 00:40:38.728
I love you so much.

626
00:40:44.484 --> 00:40:46.653
I'm right here.

627
00:40:48.196 --> 00:40:50.531
I'm right here with you.

628
00:40:50.531 --> 00:40:52.617
I'm holding your hand.

629
00:40:52.617 --> 00:40:54.452
Can you feel that. Mama?

630
00:40:54.452 --> 00:40:56.162
I just gave you a squeeze.

631
00:40:57.747 --> 00:40:59.666
I love you. Mama.

632
00:41:03.503 --> 00:41:04.962
Ma.

633
00:41:06.381 --> 00:41:08.007
Mommy?

634
00:41:10.718 --> 00:41:12.303
She opened her eyes.

635
00:41:12.303 --> 00:41:14.555
Nurse.

636
00:41:14.555 --> 00:41:17.141
Mommy. I'm here.
Here. I'm right here.

637
00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:19.227
I'm right here. Mama.

638
00:41:20.228 --> 00:41:22.188
Mommy. look at me.

639
00:41:22.188 --> 00:41:24.232
Mommy. can you hear?

640
00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.820
Oh.

641
00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:32.740
Oh. oh...

642
00:42:01.018 --> 00:42:03.730
It's a Mansfield
eight millimeter movie editor.

643
00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:05.982
That's what you wanted. right?

644
00:42:10.695 --> 00:42:12.530
Oh. my God.

645
00:42:20.538 --> 00:42:22.540
Uh. now I need a favor
in return.

646
00:42:28.838 --> 00:42:31.007
Okay. Okay. okay. okay.

647
00:42:31.007 --> 00:42:32.508
- Here's the favor.

648
00:42:32.508 --> 00:42:34.218
Yeah.

649
00:42:39.932 --> 00:42:42.268
I want you to make
a camping trip movie.

650
00:42:42.268 --> 00:42:43.770
Uh. you can learn

651
00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:45.021
how the editing machine works
while you do this.

652
00:42:45.021 --> 00:42:46.481
It'll make your mom feel better.

653
00:42:46.481 --> 00:42:48.149
Yeah.

654
00:42:48.149 --> 00:42:52.153
That last night when she danced
in the headlights.

655
00:42:52.153 --> 00:42:54.489
that'd be great.

656
00:42:54.489 --> 00:42:56.741
Get to it tomorrow. okay?

657
00:42:58.701 --> 00:43:02.747
Um. tomorrow's
when we start shooting.

658
00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:06.542
Escape to Nowhere.

659
00:43:06.542 --> 00:43:07.794
We're shooting all weekend. Dad.

660
00:43:07.794 --> 00:43:09.754
- I can't.
- Shoot it next weekend.

661
00:43:13.257 --> 00:43:15.593
We've got like 40 guys
coming to be in the movie.

662
00:43:15.593 --> 00:43:18.262
I'll-I'll w-work on all the
camping trip stuff on Monday.

663
00:43:18.262 --> 00:43:21.015
I'm asking you to do this now
for your mom. She's...

664
00:43:21.015 --> 00:43:23.935
Yeah. and I said that I will.
just not tomorrow. please.

665
00:43:23.935 --> 00:43:26.979
Don't be selfish.
She just lost her mother.

666
00:43:26.979 --> 00:43:29.148
That's more important
than your hobby.

667
00:43:29.148 --> 00:43:30.775
Dad. can you stop
calling it a hobby?

668
00:43:30.775 --> 00:43:32.985
It'll cheer her up.
watching this.

669
00:43:32.985 --> 00:43:35.029
- It's something we can do to...
- Her mom just died.

670
00:43:35.029 --> 00:43:36.906
How is that gonna cheer her up?

671
00:43:36.906 --> 00:43:39.617
Because you made it for her.

672
00:43:50.044 --> 00:43:52.964
Uh. something's not right.

673
00:43:55.925 --> 00:43:58.177
I don't know what else to do.

674
00:44:01.305 --> 00:44:03.307
Can you help me?

675
00:44:21.993 --> 00:44:23.327
Hello.

676
00:44:23.327 --> 00:44:26.664
Mitzi. Mitzi.

677
00:44:30.501 --> 00:44:32.336
Mama?

678
00:44:32.336 --> 00:44:34.422
Somebody's coming.

679
00:44:34.422 --> 00:44:36.173
Mama?

680
00:44:38.968 --> 00:44:41.596
M-Mama. What...

681
00:44:42.346 --> 00:44:44.932
- Mama. Mam...
- You mustn't let him in.

682
00:44:44.932 --> 00:44:49.270
- You mustn't let him in.
- Mama. I-I can't hear you.

683
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:50.855
I am scared.

684
00:44:50.855 --> 00:44:53.858
You mustn't let him
in the house.

685
00:44:53.858 --> 00:44:55.276
Mama. please. I...

686
00:44:55.276 --> 00:44:56.694
Do not let him in.

687
00:44:56.694 --> 00:44:58.821
- Do not let him in the house.
- What? No. I can't--

688
00:44:58.821 --> 00:45:00.573
Wh-Who's coming?

689
00:45:00.573 --> 00:45:02.199
Don't open the door.

690
00:45:02.199 --> 00:45:03.868
Mama.

691
00:45:06.203 --> 00:45:07.455
Mommy. don't go.

692
00:45:07.455 --> 00:45:09.415
Don't go yet.

693
00:45:12.335 --> 00:45:15.421
-You're having
a bad dream. -

694
00:45:33.856 --> 00:45:37.276
- This is a lot of food. Mom.

695
00:45:37.276 --> 00:45:39.820
Well. I'm upset.

696
00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:42.073
Oh. my God. That crazy dream.

697
00:45:42.073 --> 00:45:44.241
I can't get it out of my head.

698
00:45:44.241 --> 00:45:48.079
Uh. last night. I dreamed
I got a call from my mama.

699
00:45:48.079 --> 00:45:50.247
And she wanted to warn me.

700
00:45:50.247 --> 00:45:53.000
- That's silly. Grandma died.
- About what?

701
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.377
Well. something's coming.

702
00:45:54.377 --> 00:45:56.295
She wants me
to batten down the hatches.

703
00:45:56.295 --> 00:45:58.714
We're never going to be able
to eat all of this.

704
00:46:03.761 --> 00:46:05.179
Who is that?

705
00:46:16.732 --> 00:46:18.567
It's Uncle Boris.

706
00:46:18.567 --> 00:46:19.568
Hmm?

707
00:46:19.568 --> 00:46:21.237
Uncle who?

708
00:46:22.446 --> 00:46:24.115
Mom?

709
00:46:26.158 --> 00:46:28.828
That's who she meant!

710
00:46:30.913 --> 00:46:33.416
My--
That's my-my mama's brother!

711
00:46:38.713 --> 00:46:43.300
Oh. he scared the crap
out of her when they were kids!

712
00:46:50.975 --> 00:46:54.186
- Don't let him in!

713
00:46:57.690 --> 00:46:59.150
You were in the circus?

714
00:46:59.150 --> 00:47:00.860
Mama said you were
the lion tamer.

715
00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:02.445
No. not at first.

716
00:47:02.445 --> 00:47:06.449
At first. it was. "Podgorny.
pound in the tent pegs.

717
00:47:06.449 --> 00:47:09.452
Podgorny. muck out the
pachyderms."

718
00:47:09.452 --> 00:47:12.997
And then. one night.
the big cat act.

719
00:47:12.997 --> 00:47:15.499
he comes down with the flu bug.
so it was. uh.

720
00:47:15.499 --> 00:47:17.960
"Boris Podgorny.
in with the lions."

721
00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:19.670
- He's lying. right?

722
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:22.840
- No. he's telling you a story.
- Know what it's like. huh?

723
00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:24.884
Pain in the ass. sisters.

724
00:47:26.177 --> 00:47:27.678
- That's rude.
- He said "ass"!

725
00:47:27.678 --> 00:47:29.096
I know.

726
00:47:29.096 --> 00:47:32.391
But when did you start
working in the movies?

727
00:47:32.391 --> 00:47:34.351
1927.

728
00:47:34.351 --> 00:47:35.936
1927-- that was The Jazz Singer.

729
00:47:35.936 --> 00:47:37.229
That's the year
that talkies started.

730
00:47:37.229 --> 00:47:39.023
Yeah. sure. talkies. But me. no.

731
00:47:39.023 --> 00:47:41.525
I started with. um.
Uncle Tom's Cabin.

732
00:47:41.525 --> 00:47:43.194
Not a talkie.

733
00:47:43.194 --> 00:47:45.696
It was Harry Pollard.

734
00:47:45.696 --> 00:47:47.323
He acted for Selig Polyscope.

735
00:47:47.323 --> 00:47:50.201
He. uh. married
Maggie what's-her-name.

736
00:47:50.201 --> 00:47:52.203
- Mm-hmm.
- He directed Uncle Tom.

737
00:47:52.203 --> 00:47:53.746
Lift up your plate.

738
00:47:53.746 --> 00:47:57.208
So. Pollard needed help
with the bloodhounds.

739
00:47:57.208 --> 00:48:00.753
So. my pal Fleischaker was
a big name in dog acts.

740
00:48:00.753 --> 00:48:02.213
- Poodles. mainly.

741
00:48:02.213 --> 00:48:05.466
But. "Sure."
Fleischaker says to Pollard.

742
00:48:05.466 --> 00:48:08.094
"Yeah. Bloodhounds. poodles.
what's the difference?"

743
00:48:08.094 --> 00:48:09.553
Ooh.

744
00:48:09.553 --> 00:48:11.263
So. he went.

745
00:48:11.263 --> 00:48:15.226
But. uh. by this time.
uh. Fleischaker.

746
00:48:15.226 --> 00:48:17.436
he had it up to here
with the Jew-haters.

747
00:48:17.436 --> 00:48:21.023
There was a lot of that kind
in the circuses.

748
00:48:21.023 --> 00:48:22.983
Not many Jews.
lots of Jew-haters.

749
00:48:22.983 --> 00:48:24.819
- Right.
- But the movies...

750
00:48:24.819 --> 00:48:27.238
Oy vavoy!

751
00:48:27.238 --> 00:48:29.198
Fleischaker writes to me.
"Boris." he writes.

752
00:48:29.198 --> 00:48:31.408
"Boris." he writes.

753
00:48:31.408 --> 00:48:33.828
"Hollywood is heimish. heimishe.

754
00:48:33.828 --> 00:48:37.498
I'm in a minyan with Douglas
Fairbanks and Ricardo Cortez."

755
00:48:37.498 --> 00:48:38.707
- Whoa.
-"Come to Hollywood."

756
00:48:38.707 --> 00:48:40.084
So. I went.

757
00:48:42.419 --> 00:48:45.131
Your wife. she don't like
doing the dishes?

758
00:48:45.131 --> 00:48:47.967
Uh. piano hands.

759
00:48:47.967 --> 00:48:50.302
Ah. fershteyn.

760
00:48:51.095 --> 00:48:55.432
So. you like the movies.
huh. Mr. Pitselshas?

761
00:48:55.432 --> 00:48:58.435
Okay. so the sergeant.
he comes over the hill here.

762
00:48:58.435 --> 00:49:02.189
and I'm gonna go below him.
so we see him and the sky.

763
00:49:02.189 --> 00:49:03.858
And so we don't see
what he sees.

764
00:49:03.858 --> 00:49:05.568
but we do see that he's really--

765
00:49:05.568 --> 00:49:07.403
Okay. so he's. like.
almost losing his mind. right?

766
00:49:07.403 --> 00:49:09.613
- Mm-hmm. -'Cause what he is
seeing is totally terrible.

767
00:49:09.613 --> 00:49:12.449
And then. I'm gonna turn
the camera so that we see it.

768
00:49:12.449 --> 00:49:15.119
It's just in another notebook.
Hang on.

769
00:49:15.119 --> 00:49:17.288
If that's the movie. uh...

770
00:49:17.288 --> 00:49:19.665
you could show me instead of
describing me to death.

771
00:49:19.665 --> 00:49:21.917
No. that's just
our stupid camping trip.

772
00:49:21.917 --> 00:49:23.419
My dad's...

773
00:49:23.419 --> 00:49:25.296
He wants me to put
this camping film together

774
00:49:25.296 --> 00:49:26.463
so it'll cheer up Mom.

775
00:49:26.463 --> 00:49:29.800
Because her heart is broken.

776
00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:31.760
Because her mama iz toyt.

777
00:49:32.553 --> 00:49:35.264
But you. Mr. Director.
you don't want to do this.

778
00:49:35.264 --> 00:49:36.640
what your daddy tells you.

779
00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:39.018
because you want to make
your war picture. huh?

780
00:49:39.018 --> 00:49:41.145
Yeah. yeah.

781
00:49:41.145 --> 00:49:43.314
Believe me. Sammy boy. I get it.

782
00:49:43.314 --> 00:49:45.816
Family. art.

783
00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:48.402
It'll tear you in two.

784
00:49:51.113 --> 00:49:52.823
You hear that?

785
00:49:53.782 --> 00:49:55.326
Oh. yeah. My mom's practicing.
She's always...

786
00:49:55.326 --> 00:49:57.578
Sha. You talk too much. Listen.

787
00:50:03.334 --> 00:50:06.837
When she was a kid.
already she played like that.

788
00:50:07.838 --> 00:50:12.051
She should have been
a concert piano player.

789
00:50:12.051 --> 00:50:15.012
Little Rubinstein. she was.

790
00:50:15.846 --> 00:50:17.848
She could have played...

791
00:50:17.848 --> 00:50:21.518
You name it.
she could have played there.

792
00:50:21.518 --> 00:50:23.187
And she...

793
00:50:23.979 --> 00:50:27.566
Once. I visited her and Tina
and Menashe in Cincinnati.

794
00:50:27.566 --> 00:50:31.862
and she says to me she wants
to be a great piano artist.

795
00:50:31.862 --> 00:50:33.656
But she didn't do it.

796
00:50:33.656 --> 00:50:36.533
Yeah. she's really good.
You know. she played on TV.

797
00:50:36.533 --> 00:50:37.952
TV? Feh!

798
00:50:37.952 --> 00:50:41.455
She could have played
at Musikverein in Vienna.

799
00:50:42.456 --> 00:50:44.917
You see.
what she got in her heart

800
00:50:44.917 --> 00:50:46.710
is what you got. what I got.

801
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:47.753
Art.

802
00:50:50.381 --> 00:50:52.216
Like me. Like you. I think.

803
00:50:52.216 --> 00:50:55.928
We're junkies.
and art is our drug.

804
00:50:55.928 --> 00:50:57.513
Family. we love.

805
00:50:57.513 --> 00:51:00.891
But art. we're meshuga for art.

806
00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:03.602
You think I wanted to leave my
sisters. my mama and my papa.

807
00:51:03.602 --> 00:51:06.855
and go stick my stupid head
in the mouth of lions?

808
00:51:07.648 --> 00:51:10.025
Put-Putting your head
in-in a lion's mouth is art?

809
00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:17.616
No. Sticking your head in
the mouths of lions was balls.

810
00:51:17.616 --> 00:51:22.246
Making sure the lion
don't eat my head. that is art.

811
00:51:23.247 --> 00:51:27.001
You see. Tini.
she didn't say to Mitzi.

812
00:51:27.001 --> 00:51:28.877
"Go do what you gotta."

813
00:51:28.877 --> 00:51:32.881
I mean. she was a good person.
my sister. but she was scared.

814
00:51:32.881 --> 00:51:34.425
Scared for your mother.

815
00:51:34.425 --> 00:51:36.302
- She should have safety
in the family. -Uh...

816
00:51:36.302 --> 00:51:38.595
So Mitzi. she gave it all up.

817
00:51:38.595 --> 00:51:41.181
Ow! Wh...

818
00:51:41.181 --> 00:51:43.267
I want you should remember
how that hurt.

819
00:51:43.267 --> 00:51:47.062
Because when they say all this.
when they say. "What you do?

820
00:51:47.062 --> 00:51:49.398
"Oh. that's cute. It's a hobby.

821
00:51:49.398 --> 00:51:51.317
It's like stamps
or butterfly collecting."

822
00:51:51.317 --> 00:51:53.277
you feel your face.
how it feels now.

823
00:51:53.277 --> 00:51:54.528
Yeah. you almost pulled it off.

824
00:51:54.528 --> 00:51:55.946
So you remember your Uncle Boris

825
00:51:55.946 --> 00:51:57.489
and what he's telling you.

826
00:51:57.489 --> 00:51:59.992
Because you're going to join
the circus. I can tell.

827
00:51:59.992 --> 00:52:01.452
You can't hardly wait.

828
00:52:01.452 --> 00:52:02.953
You want to be in the big top.

829
00:52:02.953 --> 00:52:05.456
You'll shovel elephant shit
until they say.

830
00:52:05.456 --> 00:52:08.208
"Okay. Sammy.
now ride the goddamn elephant."

831
00:52:08.208 --> 00:52:09.877
Oh. you love those people. huh?

832
00:52:09.877 --> 00:52:12.838
Your sisters. your mama.
your papa. Except...

833
00:52:14.131 --> 00:52:15.883
Except this.

834
00:52:15.883 --> 00:52:17.760
This. I think you love
a little more.

835
00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:18.969
No. I don't.

836
00:52:18.969 --> 00:52:20.846
Yeah.

837
00:52:20.846 --> 00:52:23.015
Oh. hey.
Run all you want. boychick.

838
00:52:23.015 --> 00:52:25.476
but you know I ain't
whistling Dixie here.

839
00:52:25.476 --> 00:52:29.521
You'll make your movies.
and you will do your art.

840
00:52:29.521 --> 00:52:32.649
And you'll remember how it hurt.

841
00:52:32.649 --> 00:52:35.110
So you know what I'm saying?

842
00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:38.655
Art will give you crowns in
heaven and laurels on earth.

843
00:52:38.655 --> 00:52:40.449
But...

844
00:52:40.449 --> 00:52:44.661
it'll tear your heart out
and leave you lonely.

845
00:52:44.661 --> 00:52:47.164
You'll be a shanda
for your loved ones.

846
00:52:47.164 --> 00:52:49.208
An exile in the desert.

847
00:52:49.208 --> 00:52:50.876
A gypsy.

848
00:52:52.002 --> 00:52:53.754
Art is no game.

849
00:52:53.754 --> 00:52:55.547
Art is dangerous
as a lion's mouth.

850
00:52:55.547 --> 00:52:57.341
It'll bite your head off.

851
00:52:59.385 --> 00:53:00.844
Look at me.

852
00:53:02.179 --> 00:53:04.723
Look at me.

853
00:53:04.723 --> 00:53:08.519
Is it a wonder that Tini. she
wanted nothing to do with me?

854
00:53:08.519 --> 00:53:11.021
With me. with--

855
00:53:11.021 --> 00:53:13.232
Oh. Tini.

856
00:53:13.232 --> 00:53:17.194
Oh. Tini! Oh. Tini.

857
00:53:18.153 --> 00:53:19.321
I...

858
00:53:23.992 --> 00:53:25.786
Stop. stop! Stop it!

859
00:53:25.786 --> 00:53:29.373
What. you never saw
nobody grieving before?

860
00:53:33.794 --> 00:53:36.380
Let's go to sleep. bubbala.

861
00:53:43.846 --> 00:53:46.181
Uh. you can sleep in the bed.
I have my sleeping bag.

862
00:53:46.181 --> 00:53:47.558
I'm sitting shiva for my sister.

863
00:53:47.558 --> 00:53:48.976
I sleep on the floor.

864
00:53:48.976 --> 00:53:50.602
Y-You want to sleep
on the floor. too?

865
00:53:50.602 --> 00:53:52.938
- She was your grandma.

866
00:53:52.938 --> 00:53:56.066
Tear your clothes.
Sleep on the floor.

867
00:53:56.066 --> 00:53:58.277
Good night.

868
00:54:11.498 --> 00:54:13.917
- Say "bye-bye."
- Bye-bye.

869
00:54:13.917 --> 00:54:15.085
Bye-bye.

870
00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:02.382
I don't know what Mama
was so worried about.

871
00:55:02.382 --> 00:55:05.636
It was a nice visit.

872
01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:04.369
Yuck.

873
01:01:13.295 --> 01:01:15.255
- Whoa!

874
01:01:15.255 --> 01:01:17.757
- Oh!

875
01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:25.307
Aw.

876
01:01:27.475 --> 01:01:31.229
This is the life.

877
01:01:41.406 --> 01:01:44.743
Only you can prevent
forest fires.

878
01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:14.397
Mm.

879
01:02:24.824 --> 01:02:27.327
Oh.

880
01:02:29.955 --> 01:02:33.959
It's so beautiful.
what you made. dolly.

881
01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:37.170
You really see me.

882
01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:46.304
Hey. man. How about that. huh?

883
01:02:46.304 --> 01:02:49.265
Hey. Sammy. that was real neat.

884
01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:54.896
Die. Amerikaner!

885
01:02:56.189 --> 01:02:58.984
Move! Move! Fall backwards!

886
01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:04.906
Whoa!

887
01:03:05.699 --> 01:03:06.950
Attacke!

888
01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:10.954
- Ah! Cover!

889
01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:20.130
Krauts. they're everywhere!

890
01:03:21.715 --> 01:03:23.466
There's too many of them!

891
01:03:46.448 --> 01:03:48.324
Turn.

892
01:03:48.324 --> 01:03:49.367
Cut!

893
01:03:49.367 --> 01:03:52.162
Great. Now. um...

894
01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:55.123
Okay. come here. Come here.

895
01:03:55.123 --> 01:03:58.001
Um. you're standing here
a minute.

896
01:03:58.001 --> 01:04:00.003
looking down
at what just happened.

897
01:04:00.003 --> 01:04:02.130
- A whole minute?
- I'll give you a signal

898
01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:03.923
when I want you to start
to move. okay? So you're just...

899
01:04:03.923 --> 01:04:05.550
Like. you mean
I should count to 60?

900
01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:07.010
- What? No. No. no. no. no.
- Like. one Mississippi.

901
01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:08.011
two Mississippi. and then move?

902
01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:09.179
Don't-don't count to 60.

903
01:04:09.179 --> 01:04:11.431
You just got to...

904
01:04:11.431 --> 01:04:14.434
S-S-So... So you're all
like-like-like.

905
01:04:14.434 --> 01:04:16.019
"Oh. my God."

906
01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:20.231
Like. "All my men.
they're all...

907
01:04:20.231 --> 01:04:22.192
they're all dead.
All my men. they're-they're..."

908
01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:25.445
So you want me to.
like. act and stuff.

909
01:04:25.445 --> 01:04:27.030
Well... yeah.

910
01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:28.698
- Like I'm-I'm sort of sad
or something? -Right.

911
01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:30.742
- Um. that's the whole point.
-'Cause my whole platoon...

912
01:04:30.742 --> 01:04:32.118
R-Right. right. Your platoon.

913
01:04:32.118 --> 01:04:34.746
Your... Your men!

914
01:04:34.746 --> 01:04:37.707
They've been wiped out.

915
01:04:37.707 --> 01:04:40.627
These guys. they're your family.

916
01:04:42.045 --> 01:04:43.713
Your family's being.

917
01:04:43.713 --> 01:04:45.882
- like. murdered.

918
01:04:45.882 --> 01:04:47.801
and it's your fault.

919
01:04:47.801 --> 01:04:49.969
You did this to them. and you...

920
01:04:49.969 --> 01:04:51.471
I-I thought it was
the Nazis that...

921
01:04:51.471 --> 01:04:53.389
Okay. yeah. but it was you
who gave the order

922
01:04:53.389 --> 01:04:55.141
to go down into
the Valley of Death.

923
01:04:55.141 --> 01:04:56.392
- Okay? You decided.
- Mm-hmm.

924
01:04:56.392 --> 01:04:58.561
Nobody else. You could've...

925
01:04:58.561 --> 01:05:00.438
Mm-hmm.

926
01:05:00.438 --> 01:05:02.690
You could've protected them.
Okay?

927
01:05:02.690 --> 01:05:06.486
'Cause they trusted you.
and they loved you.

928
01:05:06.486 --> 01:05:07.570
Mm-hmm.

929
01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:13.076
Now you're just looking
at this...

930
01:05:14.953 --> 01:05:18.957
...at this thing
that you've done.

931
01:05:18.957 --> 01:05:23.336
and... you can't
save them anymore.

932
01:05:23.336 --> 01:05:26.089
Because they're all dead.

933
01:05:27.423 --> 01:05:29.634
- Wow. that's. uh...
- Yeah.

934
01:05:30.969 --> 01:05:32.595
...real gung ho.

935
01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:36.266
Okay. Okay.

936
01:05:36.266 --> 01:05:37.934
- You good?
- Lock and load.

937
01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:39.602
Yeah. Yeah. Lock and load.
All right.

938
01:05:39.602 --> 01:05:41.104
Good.

939
01:06:37.619 --> 01:06:39.412
Uh. Sammy?

940
01:06:39.412 --> 01:06:42.040
How far are you
gonna let him walk?

941
01:06:44.042 --> 01:06:45.376
Cut!

942
01:06:50.465 --> 01:06:52.383
Hey. that's a cut. Angelo!

943
01:06:52.383 --> 01:06:54.469
- Angelo!
- Angelo!

944
01:06:54.469 --> 01:06:55.720
Come back! Come back!

945
01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.014
- He said. "Cut!"
- Angelo. hey! -Angelo!

946
01:09:07.477 --> 01:09:09.729
- Bravo!

947
01:09:11.522 --> 01:09:13.316
Bravo!

948
01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:22.367
Sammy!

949
01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:29.415
Oh. dolly!

950
01:09:29.415 --> 01:09:32.460
You're not a civilian anymore.

951
01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:34.837
That movie. my God.

952
01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:36.881
It was...

953
01:09:38.174 --> 01:09:39.550
Hi. Mrs. Fabelman.

954
01:09:47.725 --> 01:09:49.143
Mr. DeMille.

955
01:09:49.143 --> 01:09:50.686
Come here.

956
01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:54.190
- Hey. there he is.
- Congratulations. young man.

957
01:09:54.190 --> 01:09:55.733
- Congratulations.
- Hey. Hey. hey.

958
01:09:55.733 --> 01:09:57.485
I guess you based it on
your dad's war stories. huh?

959
01:09:57.485 --> 01:09:58.986
Sort of.
You know. but he doesn't like

960
01:09:58.986 --> 01:10:00.696
- to talk about it. so...
- No. I understand.

961
01:10:00.696 --> 01:10:01.948
- Yeah. yeah. yeah. Yeah.

962
01:10:01.948 --> 01:10:04.075
Dad. Mom's getting a ride
with Bennie.

963
01:10:04.075 --> 01:10:05.368
She'll see us at home.

964
01:10:05.368 --> 01:10:06.702
Hey. that last scene with the...

965
01:10:06.702 --> 01:10:08.287
Why do you like blood so much?

966
01:10:08.287 --> 01:10:09.372
And are you ever
gonna make a movie

967
01:10:09.372 --> 01:10:10.915
with parts for girls again?

968
01:10:10.915 --> 01:10:12.625
- Yeah.
- Make a career...

969
01:10:12.625 --> 01:10:14.377
- With girls.
you know. like.

970
01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:17.046
because all the men stare off
into the distance all the time.

971
01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:18.923
maybe a girl could save the day.

972
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:23.052
Okay. what are the five steps
to save a drowning person?

973
01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:25.179
All right. one is
you swim behind the person

974
01:10:25.179 --> 01:10:26.514
so they don't grab you.

975
01:10:26.514 --> 01:10:28.724
Two. you throw your arm
across his chest.

976
01:10:28.724 --> 01:10:30.393
- Or her chest.
- Three.

977
01:10:30.393 --> 01:10:32.311
Not Sammy. He's too scared
of girls' boobies.

978
01:10:32.311 --> 01:10:34.522
--Three. you swim
on your back with the victim

979
01:10:34.522 --> 01:10:36.566
on your chest. using your
free arm to paddle yourself.

980
01:10:36.566 --> 01:10:38.526
And speaking of boobies.
if you ever get any.

981
01:10:38.526 --> 01:10:39.986
we'll have a party. Um...

982
01:10:39.986 --> 01:10:41.571
And at the party.
we'll give her the booby prize.

983
01:10:41.571 --> 01:10:44.365
- Ha-ha. What's four?

984
01:10:44.365 --> 01:10:45.908
Um...

985
01:10:48.244 --> 01:10:49.662
- Crap.

986
01:10:49.662 --> 01:10:51.289
Bring the victim to land. dummy.

987
01:10:51.289 --> 01:10:53.416
- Mm.
- Then five?

988
01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:56.794
Call the undertaker.

989
01:11:00.173 --> 01:11:01.883
This is serious business.

990
01:11:01.883 --> 01:11:04.051
I got to know all of this to
get the lifesaving merit badge.

991
01:11:04.051 --> 01:11:06.762
More kids die
in swimming accidents

992
01:11:06.762 --> 01:11:08.264
than in any other kind
of accident.

993
01:11:08.264 --> 01:11:09.432
Sorry. I'm sorry.

994
01:11:09.432 --> 01:11:10.933
Not everything is a big joke.

995
01:11:10.933 --> 01:11:13.269
Okay. okay.
So what's step number five?

996
01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:15.271
It's just--
You laugh at everything.

997
01:11:15.271 --> 01:11:16.647
even when nothing's funny.

998
01:11:16.647 --> 01:11:18.399
You always have to be
the center of attention.

999
01:11:18.399 --> 01:11:22.069
Eat. And don't talk
with your mouth full.

1000
01:11:22.069 --> 01:11:25.239
I'm not eating this crud
before a swimming test.

1001
01:11:25.239 --> 01:11:27.575
You can get cramps in the water
if you eat before.

1002
01:11:27.575 --> 01:11:29.452
and you can drown
from getting cramps!

1003
01:11:29.452 --> 01:11:30.703
Stop shouting at her!

1004
01:11:30.703 --> 01:11:33.122
Sammy Fabelman. goddamn it!

1005
01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:34.457
For weeks now.

1006
01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:36.792
it has been nothing
but disrespect from you!

1007
01:11:36.792 --> 01:11:38.002
Disrespect?!

1008
01:11:38.002 --> 01:11:40.254
Why are you being
such a little shit to me?!

1009
01:11:40.254 --> 01:11:41.672
Damn it to hell.
I am your mother!

1010
01:11:41.672 --> 01:11:43.966
I wish you weren't!

1011
01:12:07.323 --> 01:12:11.118
Oh. Let me see.

1012
01:12:11.118 --> 01:12:13.120
Oh. my God.

1013
01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.330
Oh. what have I done?

1014
01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:21.712
Talk to me.

1015
01:12:22.588 --> 01:12:24.590
Oh. Sammy. please talk to me.

1016
01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:26.133
Tell me what's happening.

1017
01:12:26.133 --> 01:12:31.055
Do you have any idea
how much I love you?

1018
01:12:40.147 --> 01:12:42.024
Don't go.

1019
01:15:24.478 --> 01:15:25.855
Mom.

1020
01:15:26.856 --> 01:15:28.190
Mom.

1021
01:15:30.609 --> 01:15:32.278
I won't tell.

1022
01:15:34.363 --> 01:15:36.615
I won't tell. I won't.

1023
01:15:37.908 --> 01:15:40.327
- I won't tell.

1024
01:15:40.327 --> 01:15:41.871
I won't.

1025
01:16:02.767 --> 01:16:04.727
Sure about this?

1026
01:16:06.103 --> 01:16:07.688
Mm-hmm.

1027
01:16:09.690 --> 01:16:12.026
There you go.
Bought and paid for.

1028
01:16:12.026 --> 01:16:14.695
Oh. Just a second.
It's in the back.

1029
01:16:18.407 --> 01:16:20.701
Stocking up on Kodak
before the big move?

1030
01:16:20.701 --> 01:16:22.161
N-No. I'm...

1031
01:16:22.161 --> 01:16:24.288
Smart. Film's cheaper here
than in California.

1032
01:16:24.288 --> 01:16:27.249
I bet everything's
more expensive there.

1033
01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:28.918
You're losing
your steadiest customer.

1034
01:16:28.918 --> 01:16:33.589
Him and his whole family.
they're moving west.

1035
01:16:33.589 --> 01:16:35.674
He just sold me his camera.

1036
01:16:35.674 --> 01:16:37.927
Oh. yeah? How come?

1037
01:16:37.927 --> 01:16:39.428
Says he's finished.

1038
01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:41.639
Sorry about the wait. Mr. Loewy.

1039
01:16:41.639 --> 01:16:43.599
We had to order it special.

1040
01:16:43.599 --> 01:16:45.142
You bought a camera?

1041
01:16:48.646 --> 01:16:50.439
It's for you!

1042
01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:52.817
I know how much you loved
using it for your war picture.

1043
01:16:52.817 --> 01:16:54.443
so I figured you ought to have
one of your own.

1044
01:16:54.443 --> 01:16:59.281
It's. um. a "bon voyage."
"see you later. alligator."

1045
01:16:59.281 --> 01:17:02.868
"I believe in you" present
from your uncle Bennie.

1046
01:17:13.671 --> 01:17:15.923
Because it's from me?

1047
01:17:17.716 --> 01:17:20.052
This move? Huh?

1048
01:17:20.052 --> 01:17:23.097
This is your dad's
glory-hallelujah moment.

1049
01:17:23.097 --> 01:17:26.684
And. oy vavoy. Sammy.
does that guy ever deserve it.

1050
01:17:26.684 --> 01:17:28.352
All the way back when.
back at RCA.

1051
01:17:28.352 --> 01:17:30.020
he knew what computing
was gonna be about

1052
01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:32.481
before practically
anybody else knew it.

1053
01:17:34.066 --> 01:17:36.277
And IBM?

1054
01:17:36.277 --> 01:17:38.237
That's where guys like Burt
are figuring out

1055
01:17:38.237 --> 01:17:40.990
how to use what he's made to...

1056
01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:43.033
They're gonna change
the whole goddamn world.

1057
01:17:43.033 --> 01:17:45.411
so this was the right decision.

1058
01:17:48.831 --> 01:17:51.041
For all sorts of reasons.

1059
01:17:54.003 --> 01:17:57.339
Yeah. so I'm happy for you.

1060
01:17:57.339 --> 01:17:59.425
You know I am.

1061
01:17:59.425 --> 01:18:01.135
But I'm gonna miss you.

1062
01:18:01.927 --> 01:18:04.179
All of you. a lot.

1063
01:18:11.228 --> 01:18:13.731
You think whatever bad things
you want about me. kiddo.

1064
01:18:13.731 --> 01:18:15.024
but you stop making movies.

1065
01:18:15.024 --> 01:18:17.818
it'll break your mother's heart.

1066
01:18:17.818 --> 01:18:20.321
You will break her heart.
I mean it.

1067
01:18:21.405 --> 01:18:23.616
She doesn't deserve that.
not from anybody.

1068
01:18:23.616 --> 01:18:26.035
least of all from you.

1069
01:18:39.089 --> 01:18:41.717
I'll give you 35 bucks for it.

1070
01:18:42.509 --> 01:18:44.720
You drive a hard bargain. kid.

1071
01:19:01.904 --> 01:19:04.114
I'm still done
making movies. though.

1072
01:19:04.907 --> 01:19:07.743
Everybody makes movies
in California.

1073
01:19:16.335 --> 01:19:17.336
Hey!

1074
01:19:17.336 --> 01:19:19.129
Keep the change.

1075
01:19:32.977 --> 01:19:34.853
When will the new house
be finished?

1076
01:19:34.853 --> 01:19:37.773
A few months. in the spring.

1077
01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:39.608
Can I have my own room?

1078
01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:42.069
Everybody gets their own room.

1079
01:19:42.069 --> 01:19:44.279
- Yay!
- Yes!

1080
01:19:50.494 --> 01:19:53.038
I just remembered. last night.
I had a funny dream.

1081
01:19:53.038 --> 01:19:54.790
What was it?

1082
01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:57.251
I-I can't believe
I dreamed this.

1083
01:19:57.251 --> 01:20:00.129
Uh. uh. uh. Bennie and me
were having an argument.

1084
01:20:00.129 --> 01:20:04.133
and I hauled off and socked him
right in the nose.

1085
01:20:17.062 --> 01:20:18.772
What's wrong?

1086
01:20:18.772 --> 01:20:20.107
Is Mommy carsick?

1087
01:20:20.107 --> 01:20:22.359
Let's just give her
a little time.

1088
01:20:45.382 --> 01:20:48.510
Bennie and me. we never...

1089
01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:50.637
we never...

1090
01:20:53.849 --> 01:20:56.560
I would never let it get
as far as I imagine you think.

1091
01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:59.938
Oh. I never
imagined any of that.

1092
01:20:59.938 --> 01:21:02.691
You think Dad knows?

1093
01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:04.109
I don't... I don't mean...

1094
01:21:04.109 --> 01:21:05.652
I don't mean.
"Did you tell him?"

1095
01:21:05.652 --> 01:21:07.029
I know you didn't.

1096
01:21:07.821 --> 01:21:09.573
But...

1097
01:21:13.994 --> 01:21:16.538
But you think he has an inkling?

1098
01:21:20.334 --> 01:21:22.336
I've almost told him
so many times.

1099
01:21:22.336 --> 01:21:24.713
I'll say.
"Burt. there's something

1100
01:21:24.713 --> 01:21:27.216
I've got to tell you."

1101
01:21:27.216 --> 01:21:29.218
Then he looks at me
like he can't conceive

1102
01:21:29.218 --> 01:21:30.969
that anything
could be wrong between us.

1103
01:21:30.969 --> 01:21:33.555
so instead. I say.
"Burt. we got ants."

1104
01:21:35.557 --> 01:21:37.351
Or. "Burt. could you climb
on the roof

1105
01:21:37.351 --> 01:21:39.394
and turn the antenna
so I can watch channel 5?"

1106
01:21:39.394 --> 01:21:41.939
Which. of course. he does.

1107
01:21:46.485 --> 01:21:49.321
I can't fight with your father.

1108
01:21:51.281 --> 01:21:54.118
He kills with such kindness.

1109
01:21:55.911 --> 01:21:57.871
I'm mean to him.
he buys me a dress.

1110
01:21:57.871 --> 01:22:00.666
From Saks.

1111
01:22:03.544 --> 01:22:05.462
Mom. when I showed you
what I filmed.

1112
01:22:05.462 --> 01:22:07.673
I never meant
for any of this to happen.

1113
01:22:07.673 --> 01:22:09.675
Oh... mmm.

1114
01:22:12.219 --> 01:22:14.596
Guilt is a wasted emotion.

1115
01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:17.432
Hmm.

1116
01:22:20.602 --> 01:22:23.438
What's gonna happen now?

1117
01:22:26.817 --> 01:22:28.819
I'm gonna be your mom.

1118
01:22:28.819 --> 01:22:32.406
I'm gonna be the girls' mom.

1119
01:22:32.406 --> 01:22:34.283
Despite my countless faults.

1120
01:22:34.283 --> 01:22:36.743
I'm not ruining everything
for everyone.

1121
01:22:36.743 --> 01:22:38.954
I'm gonna not be selfish.

1122
01:22:41.498 --> 01:22:44.918
Burt Fabelman is the kindest.
smartest. wisest.

1123
01:22:44.918 --> 01:22:47.462
most patient. most decent.

1124
01:22:47.462 --> 01:22:49.590
most understanding man there is.

1125
01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:52.551
and I'm gonna stay married
to him.

1126
01:23:15.157 --> 01:23:17.326
It's only a rental.

1127
01:23:17.326 --> 01:23:18.702
The new house will be ready

1128
01:23:18.702 --> 01:23:20.913
faster than you can say
"Jack Robinson."

1129
01:23:20.913 --> 01:23:23.165
Jack Robinson.

1130
01:23:25.042 --> 01:23:27.169
And we're still here.

1131
01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:30.005
Just tell me if
you're going to mope

1132
01:23:30.005 --> 01:23:31.381
for the rest of your life

1133
01:23:31.381 --> 01:23:32.633
or if it's something
you plan to outgrow.

1134
01:23:32.633 --> 01:23:33.967
Bug off.

1135
01:23:33.967 --> 01:23:35.761
You're. like. going for
the misery merit badge.

1136
01:23:35.761 --> 01:23:37.554
you and Mom
with your long faces.

1137
01:23:37.554 --> 01:23:39.848
She can't even get out of bed
to make breakfast and...

1138
01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:41.266
Okay. new rule. guys.

1139
01:23:41.266 --> 01:23:43.101
Um. when we walk to school
in the morning.

1140
01:23:43.101 --> 01:23:45.312
let's just leave
all the Fabelman mishegoss

1141
01:23:45.312 --> 01:23:47.439
behind us in the Fabelmans'
moldy old rental house.

1142
01:23:47.439 --> 01:23:49.733
So. for eight hours a day.
let's be normal kids

1143
01:23:49.733 --> 01:23:51.860
in an ordinary.
normal school. okay?

1144
01:23:53.278 --> 01:23:54.863
Some glue
on your hand or something.

1145
01:23:56.198 --> 01:23:57.950
- Too easy.
- That's what I'm telling you.

1146
01:23:57.950 --> 01:24:00.535
It's like we got parachuted

1147
01:24:00.535 --> 01:24:03.747
into the land of
the giant sequoia people.

1148
01:24:03.747 --> 01:24:05.707
All right.

1149
01:24:05.707 --> 01:24:08.794
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

1150
01:24:11.171 --> 01:24:12.798
- Up over! Nice dig.

1151
01:24:12.798 --> 01:24:14.216
Atta Johnson.

1152
01:24:14.216 --> 01:24:16.927
- I got it. I got it.
- Get it up. Get it up.

1153
01:24:16.927 --> 01:24:18.929
- Oh!
- Set. set. set. set.

1154
01:24:18.929 --> 01:24:20.555
- Hit it.
- Take it.

1155
01:24:20.555 --> 01:24:21.890
I got it.

1156
01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:24.476
Way to get up!

1157
01:24:24.476 --> 01:24:26.853
- Nice.

1158
01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:31.024
Nice. Attababy. Logan.

1159
01:24:33.026 --> 01:24:34.569
Do it again. Go again.

1160
01:24:34.569 --> 01:24:37.197
- Come on. boys.

1161
01:24:37.197 --> 01:24:39.074
- Good work. guys.

1162
01:24:39.074 --> 01:24:41.076
Keep the intensity. Keep moving.

1163
01:24:42.995 --> 01:24:44.788
Rotate. Nice. Jake.

1164
01:24:44.788 --> 01:24:46.498
Good job. Chris.

1165
01:24:48.041 --> 01:24:49.543
Fabelman. it won't hurt you.

1166
01:24:49.543 --> 01:24:51.128
It's a volleyball.
not a cannonball.

1167
01:24:51.128 --> 01:24:53.964
- Okay. Let's go. Serve.

1168
01:24:53.964 --> 01:24:55.549
Go!

1169
01:24:55.549 --> 01:24:56.758
Attababy!

1170
01:24:56.758 --> 01:24:57.968
That's good reactions.

1171
01:24:57.968 --> 01:24:59.219
Let's move. Let's...

1172
01:25:01.305 --> 01:25:03.724
Oh. my God. I am so sorry.
I didn't... Oh. my...

1173
01:25:03.724 --> 01:25:06.226
I'm gonna murder you.
you piece of shit!

1174
01:25:06.226 --> 01:25:08.103
Hey. Chad.

1175
01:25:09.855 --> 01:25:11.315
Cool it.

1176
01:25:12.107 --> 01:25:13.775
I am... I did not mean
to do that.

1177
01:25:13.775 --> 01:25:15.944
- Are you okay? I'm...
- That really hurt. asshole.

1178
01:25:15.944 --> 01:25:18.113
Watch your mouth. Logan.

1179
01:25:23.327 --> 01:25:25.495
Go fetch the ball.

1180
01:25:26.663 --> 01:25:28.123
Sure. yeah.

1181
01:25:29.041 --> 01:25:31.626
- Let's go.
- Mm-hmm.

1182
01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:36.131
Hey. new kid.

1183
01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:38.133
What's your name?

1184
01:25:40.093 --> 01:25:42.054
Sam.

1185
01:25:42.054 --> 01:25:44.473
Sam what?

1186
01:25:47.559 --> 01:25:49.436
Fabelman.

1187
01:25:51.938 --> 01:25:53.899
Told you he's a kike.

1188
01:25:53.899 --> 01:25:55.650
He doesn't like Jews.

1189
01:25:55.650 --> 01:25:58.320
Nobody likes Jews.

1190
01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:01.198
Except other Jews. right?

1191
01:26:02.324 --> 01:26:04.826
So. Bagelman...

1192
01:26:04.826 --> 01:26:06.370
No. that's not my name.

1193
01:26:06.370 --> 01:26:08.163
- Don't call me that.
- So...

1194
01:26:08.163 --> 01:26:10.415
you gave my best friend
a concussion. Bagelman.

1195
01:26:10.415 --> 01:26:13.043
- No. I didn't. Leave me alone.
- Hey.

1196
01:26:13.043 --> 01:26:15.170
Don't argue with me.

1197
01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:17.506
A serious concussion.

1198
01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:20.884
So. how do we make you pay?

1199
01:26:22.094 --> 01:26:23.428
How about this? We...

1200
01:26:23.428 --> 01:26:25.013
You're drinking
from the fountain.

1201
01:26:25.013 --> 01:26:28.308
You never hear me come up
from behind you. and bam!

1202
01:26:28.308 --> 01:26:31.770
- I shatter your front teeth
all over the spigot. -

1203
01:26:34.356 --> 01:26:36.066
Hey. look at me.

1204
01:26:38.193 --> 01:26:41.321
He's demented. like. medically.

1205
01:26:42.197 --> 01:26:44.199
So watch out for yourself.

1206
01:27:07.722 --> 01:27:09.891
- Close the door!

1207
01:27:15.730 --> 01:27:18.400
- Mom got a monkey.
- Why'd you get a monkey?

1208
01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:19.818
'Cause I needed to laugh.

1209
01:27:23.071 --> 01:27:24.656
- Oh. help me with this.

1210
01:27:24.656 --> 01:27:26.741
The directions don't make
any sense.

1211
01:27:26.741 --> 01:27:28.618
Careful. Careful.

1212
01:27:28.618 --> 01:27:30.662
Get down!

1213
01:27:31.455 --> 01:27:33.707
I'll get a banana.

1214
01:27:33.707 --> 01:27:36.293
Save the curtains.
They're rented.

1215
01:27:43.925 --> 01:27:45.594
Oh.

1216
01:27:46.845 --> 01:27:48.180
Uh. hello.

1217
01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:49.848
Who are you?

1218
01:27:49.848 --> 01:27:51.516
He's mine.

1219
01:27:51.516 --> 01:27:53.685
What are we gonna call him?

1220
01:27:54.478 --> 01:27:57.189
Bennie. His name's Bennie.

1221
01:28:03.862 --> 01:28:06.239
I don't want to see
a psychiatrist. Burt.

1222
01:28:06.239 --> 01:28:07.532
You're scaring the kids.

1223
01:28:07.532 --> 01:28:08.742
You're sleeping all day.

1224
01:28:08.742 --> 01:28:10.452
I miss the desert.

1225
01:28:10.452 --> 01:28:12.037
I miss dry heat.

1226
01:28:12.037 --> 01:28:13.914
You haven't even unwrapped
the piano.

1227
01:28:13.914 --> 01:28:16.917
You aren't cooking
or shopping or unpacking.

1228
01:28:16.917 --> 01:28:18.668
Psychiatrists help you know

1229
01:28:18.668 --> 01:28:20.629
why you're feeling something.

1230
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:22.464
They can't help you feel
something different.

1231
01:28:22.464 --> 01:28:24.466
You're behaving
like when your mother died.

1232
01:28:24.466 --> 01:28:27.844
like you're in mourning.
but nobody's died.

1233
01:28:30.013 --> 01:28:31.556
Okay.

1234
01:28:32.474 --> 01:28:35.560
So I'll call the monkey
some other name.

1235
01:28:48.657 --> 01:28:51.576
IBM's out of his league. Mitz.

1236
01:28:53.036 --> 01:28:56.039
Bennie was... He...

1237
01:28:56.039 --> 01:28:59.543
is my best friend.

1238
01:28:59.543 --> 01:29:01.545
But they don't need him.

1239
01:29:01.545 --> 01:29:03.672
This is what I know.

1240
01:29:05.465 --> 01:29:07.592
I don't need him. either.

1241
01:29:09.719 --> 01:29:12.347
Bennie wasn't your friend.

1242
01:29:13.306 --> 01:29:15.892
But you knew he was mine.

1243
01:29:18.103 --> 01:29:20.355
What does that mean?

1244
01:30:16.703 --> 01:30:19.414
Logan. I'm really.
really missing you.

1245
01:30:23.293 --> 01:30:24.836
- Hey!

1246
01:30:24.836 --> 01:30:26.630
- Who's there?

1247
01:30:26.630 --> 01:30:28.882
Who's there?

1248
01:30:40.185 --> 01:30:42.604
Bagelman. yo.

1249
01:30:54.115 --> 01:30:56.368
I left you a little snack
in your locker.

1250
01:30:56.368 --> 01:30:58.453
Did you like it?

1251
01:30:58.453 --> 01:30:59.829
Guess he wasn't hungry.

1252
01:30:59.829 --> 01:31:01.831
Uh. he said... he said it was...

1253
01:31:01.831 --> 01:31:03.792
- What'd you call it. Chad?
- Kosher.

1254
01:31:03.792 --> 01:31:06.211
- Kosher.
- Knock it off. moron!

1255
01:31:06.211 --> 01:31:09.005
We talked about this.

1256
01:31:09.005 --> 01:31:10.799
All right.

1257
01:31:10.799 --> 01:31:13.176
Come on.
We'll be late for practice.

1258
01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:18.515
So. what is this?
Are you Jewish?

1259
01:31:21.518 --> 01:31:22.977
Well...

1260
01:31:22.977 --> 01:31:24.813
Holy crap.
He's got the hots so bad.

1261
01:31:24.813 --> 01:31:26.481
he can't even talk to her.

1262
01:31:26.481 --> 01:31:29.025
No. I don't.

1263
01:31:29.025 --> 01:31:31.236
Apologize to her.

1264
01:31:31.236 --> 01:31:33.321
For what?

1265
01:31:33.321 --> 01:31:36.199
For making goo-goo eyes at her.
for drooling at her.

1266
01:31:36.199 --> 01:31:38.326
I wasn't drooling at her.

1267
01:31:38.326 --> 01:31:41.329
Then apologize to her
for killing Christ.

1268
01:31:41.329 --> 01:31:44.582
- Why are you encouraging him?

1269
01:31:45.583 --> 01:31:46.918
Go on.

1270
01:31:46.918 --> 01:31:50.171
Apologize to her
for killing our Lord.

1271
01:31:51.506 --> 01:31:53.967
Ugh. Don't go.

1272
01:31:53.967 --> 01:31:55.760
- Come watch me run.
- No. thanks.

1273
01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:57.345
- I'm not in the mood now.
- Oh. please.

1274
01:31:57.345 --> 01:31:58.888
I run better when you are there.

1275
01:31:58.888 --> 01:32:01.558
Apologize to her. you
Christ-killing son of a bitch!

1276
01:32:01.558 --> 01:32:03.518
I'm going home.

1277
01:32:05.437 --> 01:32:07.230
Go on and say sorry.

1278
01:32:07.230 --> 01:32:10.024
You're getting me in trouble
with my girl.

1279
01:32:10.024 --> 01:32:12.861
You know. obviously.
since I'm not 2.000 years old

1280
01:32:12.861 --> 01:32:16.030
and have never been to Rome.
I'm not apologizing.

1281
01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:18.867
But hey. you know. maybe. uh.
your boyfriend should

1282
01:32:18.867 --> 01:32:21.119
apologize to you
for making out in the stairwell

1283
01:32:21.119 --> 01:32:23.830
half an hour ago
with some redhead.

1284
01:32:23.830 --> 01:32:26.207
He-he's lying. He's...
I-I didn't do that.

1285
01:32:26.207 --> 01:32:27.375
I swear.

1286
01:32:27.375 --> 01:32:29.210
You told me
you were finished with her.

1287
01:32:30.628 --> 01:32:33.965
Logan. you lied to me!

1288
01:32:36.259 --> 01:32:37.594
Claudia.

1289
01:32:40.972 --> 01:32:43.892
Whoa...

1290
01:32:46.895 --> 01:32:48.855
You made a mistake.
Listen to me.

1291
01:32:48.855 --> 01:32:50.231
- You made a mistake.

1292
01:32:50.231 --> 01:32:51.733
- You're gonna fix it.
- Bash his head in!

1293
01:32:51.733 --> 01:32:53.401
Shut up. Chad. goddamn it!

1294
01:32:53.401 --> 01:32:55.695
Tomorrow. you're gonna
find her first thing.

1295
01:32:55.695 --> 01:32:57.405
and you're gonna tell her
you were lying.

1296
01:32:57.405 --> 01:32:58.907
Say-say you were. um. scared.

1297
01:32:58.907 --> 01:33:00.492
Say-say whatever you
got to say. but you tell her

1298
01:33:00.492 --> 01:33:03.411
it wasn't true and you did not
see me doing that.

1299
01:33:03.411 --> 01:33:05.747
Or I swear. I will hurt you

1300
01:33:05.747 --> 01:33:07.999
worse than
you've ever been hurt.

1301
01:33:09.417 --> 01:33:10.835
You get me?

1302
01:33:10.835 --> 01:33:13.588
Nod to show
you dig what I'm saying.

1303
01:33:26.518 --> 01:33:28.228
He won't tell me who did this.

1304
01:33:28.228 --> 01:33:30.438
- Ask him who did this.

1305
01:33:30.438 --> 01:33:32.440
Tell your father who did this.
and he will drive

1306
01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:34.317
to that little shit's house.
and he will beat

1307
01:33:34.317 --> 01:33:36.319
- the living crap out of him.
- Is your nose broken?

1308
01:33:36.319 --> 01:33:38.196
No. of course it's not broken.
You think I'd be sitting here

1309
01:33:38.196 --> 01:33:39.697
- if his nose was broken?
- Who hit you?

1310
01:33:39.697 --> 01:33:41.324
What do you care who it was?

1311
01:33:41.324 --> 01:33:43.117
It's not like
you'll do anything about it.

1312
01:33:43.117 --> 01:33:44.744
Tell me what happened first.

1313
01:33:44.744 --> 01:33:46.538
What happened is I hate it here.

1314
01:33:46.538 --> 01:33:49.874
and what happened is
you brought us here because...

1315
01:33:49.874 --> 01:33:52.126
Because I got a better job.
so we moved.

1316
01:33:52.126 --> 01:33:54.963
You don't even care
where you are.

1317
01:33:54.963 --> 01:33:57.298
You get to go to work.
and that could be in Iceland.

1318
01:33:57.298 --> 01:33:59.592
You're working
with your goddamn machines.

1319
01:33:59.592 --> 01:34:02.679
so you get to be happy
while the rest of us are mis...

1320
01:34:02.679 --> 01:34:04.180
- Just. come on.
- Don't.

1321
01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:05.807
Well. but you-you're bleeding
on the carpet.

1322
01:34:05.807 --> 01:34:07.183
It's a rental house.

1323
01:34:07.183 --> 01:34:09.310
Do you even notice
how much we hate it here.

1324
01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:12.647
where we're practically the
only Jewish people for miles

1325
01:34:12.647 --> 01:34:14.941
and everything is awful?

1326
01:34:14.941 --> 01:34:18.695
Do you even care
that this is your fault--

1327
01:34:18.695 --> 01:34:20.029
everything
that's happening now--

1328
01:34:20.029 --> 01:34:21.656
just because
you ran away from home

1329
01:34:21.656 --> 01:34:23.032
and took all of us with you?!

1330
01:34:23.032 --> 01:34:25.243
I came here so I could work
ten times harder

1331
01:34:25.243 --> 01:34:26.786
with ten times
the responsibility.

1332
01:34:26.786 --> 01:34:28.288
which seems to have escaped
everybody.

1333
01:34:28.288 --> 01:34:29.873
s-so I could build us
a nice home and...

1334
01:34:29.873 --> 01:34:31.291
Could everyone settle?
I want to say something.

1335
01:34:31.291 --> 01:34:33.042
No. no. You didn't come here
to build houses.

1336
01:34:33.042 --> 01:34:34.836
You didn't come here to work.
You ran away.

1337
01:34:34.836 --> 01:34:36.588
I think you have something
to say to me. Sammy!

1338
01:34:36.588 --> 01:34:38.089
And if I'm right about that.

1339
01:34:38.089 --> 01:34:39.841
then get it off your chest
and say it to my face!

1340
01:34:39.841 --> 01:34:42.218
I started therapy.

1341
01:36:17.021 --> 01:36:19.232
Anyways.

1342
01:36:19.232 --> 01:36:21.234
what I really wanted
to say is that.

1343
01:36:21.234 --> 01:36:23.152
about yesterday.
what I told you was...

1344
01:36:23.152 --> 01:36:25.405
it wasn't true. and I lied.

1345
01:36:25.405 --> 01:36:27.615
and I'm sorry.

1346
01:36:27.615 --> 01:36:29.158
But why?

1347
01:36:29.158 --> 01:36:31.160
- What did I ever do to you?
- Oh. no. no.

1348
01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:32.954
- It wasn't about you.
- Because that. like. really.

1349
01:36:32.954 --> 01:36:35.164
- really wasn't cool. you know?
- No. I didn't mean to hurt...

1350
01:36:35.164 --> 01:36:37.542
- I didn't mean to hurt you.
- Because I really love Logan.

1351
01:36:37.542 --> 01:36:38.710
Yeah. she cried herself to sleep

1352
01:36:38.710 --> 01:36:39.961
thinking he cheated on her.

1353
01:36:39.961 --> 01:36:41.212
You ought to be more considerate

1354
01:36:41.212 --> 01:36:43.214
of other people's feelings.

1355
01:36:43.214 --> 01:36:45.049
Okay. but Logan told me
to say I killed Christ.

1356
01:36:45.049 --> 01:36:46.384
- That wasn't Logan.
- What?

1357
01:36:46.384 --> 01:36:47.969
- That was Chad.
- Why would he do that?

1358
01:36:47.969 --> 01:36:50.013
Logan laughed.
He thought it was hilarious.

1359
01:36:51.472 --> 01:36:53.474
He's Jewish.

1360
01:36:53.474 --> 01:36:55.309
You don't say.

1361
01:36:56.602 --> 01:36:59.147
Yeah. I mean. since the day
I was circumcised.

1362
01:37:06.612 --> 01:37:09.157
So. how'd you know
she was a redhead?

1363
01:37:09.157 --> 01:37:11.284
- Oh. my God.
- Hmm?

1364
01:37:11.284 --> 01:37:13.494
He was making out
with Renee Reynolds?

1365
01:37:16.372 --> 01:37:18.458
- If you were lying...
- Mm-hmm?

1366
01:37:18.458 --> 01:37:20.960
...how'd you know
her hair color?

1367
01:37:23.421 --> 01:37:25.256
Uh...

1368
01:37:30.845 --> 01:37:33.347
Does it hurt?

1369
01:37:33.347 --> 01:37:35.349
So. you don't believe in Jesus?

1370
01:37:35.349 --> 01:37:37.435
Monica's. like.
totally hot on Jesus.

1371
01:37:38.519 --> 01:37:40.146
I can't imagine my life
without him.

1372
01:37:40.146 --> 01:37:43.357
Well. we've managed
for like 5.000 years.

1373
01:37:43.357 --> 01:37:45.902
so I guess it's possible.

1374
01:37:45.902 --> 01:37:48.446
Maybe we could...

1375
01:37:48.446 --> 01:37:51.824
I don't know. get together
and pray on it.

1376
01:37:53.868 --> 01:37:56.245
- What. like. you and me?

1377
01:37:56.245 --> 01:37:58.331
We can ask him
to come into your heart

1378
01:37:58.331 --> 01:38:02.710
and. you know. see what happens.

1379
01:38:03.711 --> 01:38:05.880
Yeah. Yeah. yeah. yeah. Sure.

1380
01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:07.340
- I mean...

1381
01:38:07.340 --> 01:38:10.051
What? Like. that would be.
like. when? Like. today?

1382
01:38:14.388 --> 01:38:17.350
It's a lot. huh?

1383
01:38:17.350 --> 01:38:21.145
It's sort of a shrine almost.

1384
01:38:21.145 --> 01:38:23.564
A shrine to guys.

1385
01:38:23.564 --> 01:38:25.066
L-Lots of guys.

1386
01:38:25.066 --> 01:38:27.652
They're sexy.

1387
01:38:27.652 --> 01:38:29.570
I guess.

1388
01:38:32.865 --> 01:38:34.867
I mean. not Jesus.

1389
01:38:34.867 --> 01:38:37.078
Jesus is sexy.

1390
01:38:38.246 --> 01:38:40.248
Isn't that. like.
a sin or something?

1391
01:38:40.248 --> 01:38:42.041
I don't know.

1392
01:38:42.041 --> 01:38:44.252
He came to us as a man.

1393
01:38:44.252 --> 01:38:47.004
A handsome young man.

1394
01:38:47.004 --> 01:38:50.091
He could've come as a girl
or an old man

1395
01:38:50.091 --> 01:38:52.093
or someone with leprosy. but...

1396
01:38:52.093 --> 01:38:54.303
Nobody knows
what he really looked like.

1397
01:38:55.096 --> 01:38:57.223
Probably. he looked like you.

1398
01:38:57.223 --> 01:38:59.767
Oh. because... because he was...

1399
01:38:59.767 --> 01:39:01.227
Jewish.

1400
01:39:01.227 --> 01:39:03.437
A handsome Jewish boy.

1401
01:39:04.772 --> 01:39:06.941
Just like you.

1402
01:39:23.082 --> 01:39:25.001
Let's pray.

1403
01:39:31.465 --> 01:39:33.551
Close your eyes.

1404
01:39:35.469 --> 01:39:37.805
Lord. I'm here
with my friend Sammy...

1405
01:39:37.805 --> 01:39:39.056
Sam.

1406
01:39:39.056 --> 01:39:41.309
I'm here with
my good friend Sam.

1407
01:39:41.309 --> 01:39:45.730
who's Jewish.
and he's a nice boy.

1408
01:39:45.730 --> 01:39:50.276
Lord Jesus. he's good and brave.

1409
01:39:50.276 --> 01:39:54.322
and he's funny. Lord. and...

1410
01:39:54.322 --> 01:39:57.158
and I like him.

1411
01:40:01.370 --> 01:40:03.289
Relax.

1412
01:40:07.835 --> 01:40:09.420
Ask.

1413
01:40:10.838 --> 01:40:12.673
Ask him to come into you.

1414
01:40:12.673 --> 01:40:15.051
Ask him to enter you.

1415
01:40:17.637 --> 01:40:19.680
Um...

1416
01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:21.849
hi there. Jesus.

1417
01:40:21.849 --> 01:40:24.560
It's me. Sam Fabelman.

1418
01:40:26.145 --> 01:40:28.397
If you're real. show me

1419
01:40:28.397 --> 01:40:30.650
- a sign or something. and...
- No. wait. You can't...

1420
01:40:30.650 --> 01:40:34.403
You can't ask Jesus
to do tricks to impress you.

1421
01:40:34.403 --> 01:40:36.239
You have to be humble.

1422
01:40:36.239 --> 01:40:38.824
You have to beg him to.
I'll do it.

1423
01:40:39.617 --> 01:40:42.662
I'm gonna beg the Holy Spirit
to come into me.

1424
01:40:42.662 --> 01:40:45.790
I'm gonna draw the Spirit
in with my breath.

1425
01:40:47.208 --> 01:40:49.877
Spirit. come into me!

1426
01:40:49.877 --> 01:40:51.712
Please. Holy Spirit!

1427
01:40:51.712 --> 01:40:54.215
I'm begging you.
sweet Holy Father.

1428
01:40:54.215 --> 01:40:56.425
for the sake of my friend Sammy.

1429
01:40:56.425 --> 01:40:57.677
Sam.

1430
01:40:57.677 --> 01:40:59.262
Come into us. Jesus!

1431
01:40:59.262 --> 01:41:01.222
Hear our prayer!

1432
01:41:01.222 --> 01:41:02.848
Open your mouth.

1433
01:41:02.848 --> 01:41:06.435
Open your mouth and take
the spirit of Christ into you.

1434
01:41:33.963 --> 01:41:36.173
Monica. Sammy. I made snacks.

1435
01:41:36.173 --> 01:41:38.259
- We're coming!

1436
01:41:38.259 --> 01:41:40.011
- Oh...
- Tomorrow after school.

1437
01:41:40.011 --> 01:41:41.971
want to meet out back
behind the bleachers?

1438
01:41:41.971 --> 01:41:43.431
- Yeah.
- Cool.

1439
01:41:43.431 --> 01:41:45.599
We can pray some more.

1440
01:41:55.443 --> 01:41:58.487
When I was a girl
and I felt sad.

1441
01:41:58.487 --> 01:42:01.198
I'd go to the zoo
and I'd watch the monkeys.

1442
01:42:01.198 --> 01:42:02.950
They made you laugh?

1443
01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:05.286
Yeah. yeah. the monkeyshines.

1444
01:42:05.286 --> 01:42:07.330
Oh. but there was
more to it than that.

1445
01:42:07.330 --> 01:42:09.332
It was...

1446
01:42:09.332 --> 01:42:11.375
They understand
what we've done to them.

1447
01:42:11.375 --> 01:42:13.336
with the cages
and the people pointing.

1448
01:42:13.336 --> 01:42:15.129
We share that with them.

1449
01:42:15.129 --> 01:42:17.423
the truth of
how cruel people are.

1450
01:42:17.423 --> 01:42:19.091
But if you watch them
for long enough.

1451
01:42:19.091 --> 01:42:21.969
you can tell they know stuff
we can't begin to imagine.

1452
01:42:21.969 --> 01:42:23.804
Important stuff.

1453
01:42:23.804 --> 01:42:25.973
And they're not gonna
let us in on it

1454
01:42:25.973 --> 01:42:27.975
'cause it belongs to them.

1455
01:42:27.975 --> 01:42:29.643
It's their own monkey business.

1456
01:42:29.643 --> 01:42:32.396
Theirs. It's not ours. It's...

1457
01:42:33.939 --> 01:42:36.025
Oh. I don't know.

1458
01:42:36.025 --> 01:42:37.818
Self-possession.

1459
01:42:37.818 --> 01:42:39.695
Right.

1460
01:42:41.072 --> 01:42:43.407
They belong to themselves.

1461
01:42:43.407 --> 01:42:45.701
If it belongs to itself.

1462
01:42:45.701 --> 01:42:47.953
let it go back
to where it came from.

1463
01:42:47.953 --> 01:42:50.289
Anyway. that's how come
I got a monkey.

1464
01:42:50.289 --> 01:42:52.208
And a therapist.

1465
01:42:52.208 --> 01:42:54.085
He throws his poop.

1466
01:42:54.085 --> 01:42:55.878
The therapist?

1467
01:42:55.878 --> 01:42:57.171
No. the monkey.

1468
01:42:57.171 --> 01:42:58.672
That's why I'm staying
in a hotel.

1469
01:42:58.672 --> 01:43:01.008
You don't have to.
We have plenty of room.

1470
01:43:01.008 --> 01:43:02.927
My rabbi in New Jersey says

1471
01:43:02.927 --> 01:43:05.471
a monkey in the house
isn't kosher.

1472
01:43:05.471 --> 01:43:07.014
That's why we're not
going to eat him.

1473
01:43:07.014 --> 01:43:08.808
Did you schedule him
for his polio vaccine?

1474
01:43:08.808 --> 01:43:10.518
- They can get polio?
- Pass the peas.

1475
01:43:10.518 --> 01:43:12.019
Well. they're susceptible
to pretty much everything

1476
01:43:12.019 --> 01:43:14.188
- humans are. so yes.
- He hates going to the vet.

1477
01:43:14.188 --> 01:43:15.689
You see. Monica. in this family.

1478
01:43:15.689 --> 01:43:17.983
it's the scientists
versus the artists.

1479
01:43:17.983 --> 01:43:19.402
Sammy's on my team.

1480
01:43:19.402 --> 01:43:21.529
Takes after me.
except he's got real talent.

1481
01:43:21.529 --> 01:43:22.696
Mom.

1482
01:43:22.696 --> 01:43:24.115
And he's completely terrible
at science.

1483
01:43:24.115 --> 01:43:25.699
Mm. And algebra.

1484
01:43:25.699 --> 01:43:26.992
And sports.

1485
01:43:26.992 --> 01:43:29.370
- Will you please stop?
- He showed me his camera.

1486
01:43:29.370 --> 01:43:31.455
- Is he good at kissing?

1487
01:43:31.455 --> 01:43:33.040
- I'll tell you later.
- Shut up!

1488
01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:35.459
- He sleeps with a camera
under his pillow. -No. I don't.

1489
01:43:35.459 --> 01:43:37.211
But he refuses
to actually shoot anything.

1490
01:43:37.211 --> 01:43:39.171
He should shoot Ditch Day.

1491
01:43:39.171 --> 01:43:41.340
- Mm. Mm-mm. -They still
don't have a photographer.

1492
01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:42.716
- You could volunteer.
- What's Ditch Day?

1493
01:43:42.716 --> 01:43:44.510
It doesn't matter.
I'm not going.

1494
01:43:44.510 --> 01:43:45.928
Something seniors get to do
at the end of the year.

1495
01:43:45.928 --> 01:43:47.680
They let us pretend like
we're ditching school.

1496
01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:50.015
and we all take buses
to Santa Cruz Main Beach.

1497
01:43:50.015 --> 01:43:51.600
You have to go! Everyone goes.

1498
01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:53.436
My dad will lend you his camera.

1499
01:43:53.436 --> 01:43:54.770
It's super fancy.

1500
01:43:54.770 --> 01:43:56.564
Costs like a thousand dollars.

1501
01:43:56.564 --> 01:43:59.400
It's called. like. a...
an "Air" something. I forget.

1502
01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:00.943
- Wait. not an Arriflex.
- Right.

1503
01:44:00.943 --> 01:44:04.196
Your dad owns
a 16 millimeter Arriflex?

1504
01:44:05.072 --> 01:44:07.032
Wow. Wow. okay.
So. 16 millimeter on stock...

1505
01:44:07.032 --> 01:44:09.034
See. usually it's the teacher
who shoots the Ditch Day movie.

1506
01:44:09.034 --> 01:44:10.828
- and it's a big joke. -That's
two minutes. 45 seconds a roll.

1507
01:44:10.828 --> 01:44:12.663
At ten bucks a roll.
for a whole day. that would be.

1508
01:44:12.663 --> 01:44:14.039
- like. insanely expensive.
- I owe you a graduation check.

1509
01:44:14.039 --> 01:44:15.916
My dad will get the school
to pay for it.

1510
01:44:15.916 --> 01:44:17.668
And I need to rent a
16 millimeter editing machine.

1511
01:44:17.668 --> 01:44:19.628
and I have no idea
how much that costs.

1512
01:44:19.628 --> 01:44:21.046
- so it's not gonna work.
- My dad will rent one for you.

1513
01:44:21.046 --> 01:44:24.008
Uh. we can rent it.
whatever it costs. right?

1514
01:44:24.008 --> 01:44:25.926
Burt.

1515
01:44:27.553 --> 01:44:29.889
Uh. what's wrong
with your Bolex?

1516
01:44:29.889 --> 01:44:31.932
You could afford to be
a little encouraging.

1517
01:44:31.932 --> 01:44:33.559
About what?

1518
01:44:33.559 --> 01:44:35.352
About him making movies again.

1519
01:44:35.352 --> 01:44:36.937
Well. I didn't say that.
I'm just talking...

1520
01:44:36.937 --> 01:44:39.148
- Maybe he's moved on.
- On from what?

1521
01:44:39.148 --> 01:44:41.525
He hasn't picked up his camera
once since we got here.

1522
01:44:41.525 --> 01:44:42.985
He'll be going to college
this September.

1523
01:44:42.985 --> 01:44:44.904
Maybe his feelings about it
have changed.

1524
01:44:44.904 --> 01:44:47.531
He's growing up.
I'm enthusiastic about that.

1525
01:44:47.531 --> 01:44:49.116
Filming is what he loves.

1526
01:44:49.116 --> 01:44:50.868
- I don't think him...
- Oh. Jesus Christ. I'm sorry.

1527
01:44:50.868 --> 01:44:52.828
Guys. can we please just
stop talking about me?

1528
01:44:52.828 --> 01:44:54.371
I'd think that you.
more than anyone.

1529
01:44:54.371 --> 01:44:55.664
should have some
understanding of what a...

1530
01:44:55.664 --> 01:44:56.999
Let's go to your place
or something.

1531
01:44:56.999 --> 01:44:58.918
Maybe your dad
can show me the camera.

1532
01:44:58.918 --> 01:45:00.544
- ...a vocation. a-a calling is.
- All right. All right.

1533
01:45:00.544 --> 01:45:01.962
We'll rent him the equipment.

1534
01:45:01.962 --> 01:45:03.255
He hates the beach.

1535
01:45:03.255 --> 01:45:04.757
That's why he doesn't want
to go to Ditch Day.

1536
01:45:04.757 --> 01:45:06.342
But it's not your calling.

1537
01:45:06.342 --> 01:45:08.552
Is that why you can't. uh.
respect it?

1538
01:45:08.552 --> 01:45:09.970
I have respect for everything

1539
01:45:09.970 --> 01:45:11.847
- he works hard doing.
- He's afraid.

1540
01:45:11.847 --> 01:45:13.766
He's scared if he does. those
guys will beat him up again.

1541
01:45:13.766 --> 01:45:16.018
What? No. I'm not. I never said
that I was scared of them.

1542
01:45:16.018 --> 01:45:17.770
- You don't. though.
- You got beat up?

1543
01:45:17.770 --> 01:45:19.772
You always dismiss
what he does. what anyone does.

1544
01:45:19.772 --> 01:45:23.651
that's playful or imaginative
as a pastime or a hobby.

1545
01:45:23.651 --> 01:45:25.486
You already won. Mitz.

1546
01:45:25.486 --> 01:45:27.446
I surrendered.
I'm not taking the bait.

1547
01:45:27.446 --> 01:45:28.989
Can you guys please
just cut it out?

1548
01:45:28.989 --> 01:45:30.866
- Oh. who's baiting who?
- You're embarrassing me.

1549
01:45:30.866 --> 01:45:32.451
I said I'd take him for his
polio shot the first five times

1550
01:45:32.451 --> 01:45:33.869
- you asked me. didn't I?
- Well. you say you will.

1551
01:45:33.869 --> 01:45:36.121
but I guess you don't mean it.
so I ask again

1552
01:45:36.121 --> 01:45:37.831
- and again and again.
- He's scared of shots.

1553
01:45:37.831 --> 01:45:40.376
- He's scared of the doctor.

1554
01:45:41.210 --> 01:45:44.630
I am taking the goddamn monkey
to the vet. okay?

1555
01:45:44.630 --> 01:45:46.173
Probably needs a tranquilizer

1556
01:45:46.173 --> 01:45:47.675
with all this yelling.

1557
01:45:47.675 --> 01:45:50.094
Can you ask your dad
about borrowing the camera?

1558
01:45:50.094 --> 01:45:51.512
He'll say yes.

1559
01:45:51.512 --> 01:45:53.514
Thank you.

1560
01:45:53.514 --> 01:45:56.183
I'm filming Ditch Day.

1561
01:45:56.183 --> 01:45:57.977
I think it's a great idea.

1562
01:46:23.711 --> 01:46:25.713
- Nice!

1563
01:46:30.968 --> 01:46:32.845
- Go. go. go. go. go!

1564
01:49:05.748 --> 01:49:08.625
- Don't be scared.

1565
01:49:13.922 --> 01:49:17.468
Your mom misses Phoenix
too much.

1566
01:49:17.468 --> 01:49:18.844
Tell them the truth.

1567
01:49:18.844 --> 01:49:20.846
And I can't leave.

1568
01:49:20.846 --> 01:49:22.806
This is where my work is.

1569
01:49:22.806 --> 01:49:24.141
I have to...

1570
01:49:24.141 --> 01:49:25.726
That's crazy.

1571
01:49:25.726 --> 01:49:28.562
You... you can't ruin everything

1572
01:49:28.562 --> 01:49:30.773
because you miss one place

1573
01:49:30.773 --> 01:49:33.108
and you're stuck someplace else.

1574
01:49:33.108 --> 01:49:35.736
I miss Bennie too much.

1575
01:49:35.736 --> 01:49:37.279
So?

1576
01:49:37.279 --> 01:49:39.031
We all miss him.

1577
01:49:39.823 --> 01:49:42.326
This is a different kind
of missing.

1578
01:49:42.326 --> 01:49:43.952
Because what?

1579
01:49:44.745 --> 01:49:46.622
You love Bennie?

1580
01:49:46.622 --> 01:49:48.207
- Don't you love Daddy?

1581
01:49:48.207 --> 01:49:49.291
Sure she does.

1582
01:49:49.291 --> 01:49:51.251
- Of course I love Dad.
- And I love Mom.

1583
01:49:51.251 --> 01:49:53.587
Then why is this
all of a sudden happening?!

1584
01:49:53.587 --> 01:49:55.422
Stay together.

1585
01:49:55.422 --> 01:49:58.383
You love each other.
and you love us.

1586
01:49:58.383 --> 01:49:59.927
and we don't want this.

1587
01:49:59.927 --> 01:50:02.095
We don't want to have to move
back and forth

1588
01:50:02.095 --> 01:50:03.639
and not live with both of you.

1589
01:50:03.639 --> 01:50:05.432
We can't. Dad. we can't.

1590
01:50:05.432 --> 01:50:06.934
You're always so mean to him!

1591
01:50:06.934 --> 01:50:08.852
That's why
you're getting divorced!

1592
01:50:08.852 --> 01:50:10.771
It's because of you!

1593
01:50:10.771 --> 01:50:12.147
Don't blame your mom.

1594
01:50:12.147 --> 01:50:14.191
This wasn't her idea.
It was mine.

1595
01:50:14.191 --> 01:50:17.194
- Don't-don't say that.
- No. it wasn't.

1596
01:50:17.194 --> 01:50:19.822
She just said it was because
of Bennie. so stop lying!

1597
01:50:19.822 --> 01:50:22.074
Both of you. stop lying!

1598
01:50:22.074 --> 01:50:24.201
I'm giving your mom a chance

1599
01:50:24.201 --> 01:50:28.914
to go back to. uh.
Phoenix to live...

1600
01:50:55.482 --> 01:50:57.317
I don't understand
how you can go back

1601
01:50:57.317 --> 01:50:59.611
to your beach blanket movie
after that.

1602
01:50:59.611 --> 01:51:01.989
We're different. I guess.

1603
01:51:17.963 --> 01:51:20.257
Is she gonna marry Bennie?

1604
01:51:21.049 --> 01:51:23.218
If she wants to. she will.

1605
01:51:24.970 --> 01:51:27.347
God. she's the most selfish
person in the world.

1606
01:51:27.347 --> 01:51:30.559
It must've been hard for her.
married to a...

1607
01:51:30.559 --> 01:51:32.561
a genius.

1608
01:51:32.561 --> 01:51:34.521
Dad worships Mom.

1609
01:51:34.521 --> 01:51:36.023
Okay.

1610
01:51:36.940 --> 01:51:40.944
But maybe it's hard
being worshipped by someone

1611
01:51:40.944 --> 01:51:42.946
you know you'll never
be as good as

1612
01:51:42.946 --> 01:51:45.157
or ever do anything as good as.

1613
01:51:45.157 --> 01:51:46.450
She...

1614
01:51:47.576 --> 01:51:49.953
She laughs at Bennie's jokes...

1615
01:51:51.580 --> 01:51:54.666
...but Dad's always
been her best audience.

1616
01:51:54.666 --> 01:51:56.710
Come on.

1617
01:51:56.710 --> 01:51:58.587
She'll be fine.

1618
01:51:58.587 --> 01:52:01.548
She'll tell herself everything
happens for a reason.

1619
01:52:01.548 --> 01:52:03.884
She'll make excuses
like she always does.

1620
01:52:03.884 --> 01:52:05.886
You're way more selfish
than her.

1621
01:52:07.679 --> 01:52:09.723
That's why you're angry at her.

1622
01:52:09.723 --> 01:52:12.684
It's because she's scared.

1623
01:52:12.684 --> 01:52:14.895
just like you. Sammy.

1624
01:52:15.896 --> 01:52:19.900
Out of everyone
in this out-of-control.

1625
01:52:19.900 --> 01:52:23.236
falling-apart family.

1626
01:52:23.236 --> 01:52:26.406
the one who's most like Mitzi
is you.

1627
01:52:29.368 --> 01:52:30.744
Wait.

1628
01:52:32.913 --> 01:52:34.831
Look. before I show this
to the whole school.

1629
01:52:34.831 --> 01:52:37.292
could you please
watch it with me?

1630
01:53:24.131 --> 01:53:26.842
- Hold your breath!

1631
01:53:33.348 --> 01:53:35.017
Here.

1632
01:53:35.017 --> 01:53:38.103
Oh. wow.

1633
01:53:48.739 --> 01:53:51.116
Did you find Jesus?

1634
01:53:52.534 --> 01:53:54.453
In a jewelry store.

1635
01:54:26.276 --> 01:54:27.944
Hey. man. look who's here.

1636
01:54:27.944 --> 01:54:29.613
Hey!
Let's get this party started!

1637
01:54:29.613 --> 01:54:31.698
- Let the festivities begin.

1638
01:54:33.533 --> 01:54:35.535
So. in September.
when I move to L.A..

1639
01:54:35.535 --> 01:54:38.205
I'm gonna try and get work
in a movie studio.

1640
01:54:38.205 --> 01:54:40.415
Thought you were going
to college.

1641
01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:43.293
Could you...

1642
01:54:44.377 --> 01:54:46.296
Would you ever consider
coming with me?

1643
01:54:46.296 --> 01:54:48.507
I'm going to Texas A&M.

1644
01:54:48.507 --> 01:54:49.716
You know that.

1645
01:54:49.716 --> 01:54:52.469
Yes. I do.

1646
01:54:52.469 --> 01:54:55.097
But I thought...

1647
01:54:56.807 --> 01:55:00.477
...maybe you should
change your mind. because...

1648
01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:05.524
Because what?

1649
01:55:06.942 --> 01:55:09.152
- Because I love you.
- Ow!

1650
01:55:09.152 --> 01:55:10.612
- Sammy!
- Oh. sorry!

1651
01:55:10.612 --> 01:55:13.031
Sorry. sorry. sorry.

1652
01:55:13.824 --> 01:55:16.118
That's not possible.

1653
01:55:16.118 --> 01:55:17.410
- What?

1654
01:55:17.410 --> 01:55:18.829
N-No. it is.

1655
01:55:18.829 --> 01:55:20.956
- Monica. I love you.

1656
01:55:20.956 --> 01:55:23.041
That's impossible. Sammy...

1657
01:55:23.041 --> 01:55:24.626
Sam.

1658
01:55:25.710 --> 01:55:27.963
We only started dating like...

1659
01:55:30.257 --> 01:55:31.842
Everything was so normal before.

1660
01:55:31.842 --> 01:55:33.176
Why are you acting so...

1661
01:55:33.176 --> 01:55:35.262
No. because
nothing's normal now.

1662
01:55:35.262 --> 01:55:37.472
They're getting a divorce.

1663
01:55:38.932 --> 01:55:40.600
What are you talking about?

1664
01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:43.311
My mom and dad.
they're splitting up.

1665
01:55:47.357 --> 01:55:49.943
Jesus Christ! This is prom!

1666
01:55:49.943 --> 01:55:52.863
You can't just blurt something
out like that at prom!

1667
01:55:52.863 --> 01:55:54.739
Wait.

1668
01:55:56.950 --> 01:55:58.493
Monica!

1669
01:55:58.493 --> 01:56:00.287
Look. that's-that's got
nothing to do with us. okay?

1670
01:56:00.287 --> 01:56:02.205
- I'm not... -That's not why
I said that I love you.

1671
01:56:02.205 --> 01:56:04.082
- I don't know why I...
- I'm not gonna change

1672
01:56:04.082 --> 01:56:05.750
my whole life
and move to Hollywood

1673
01:56:05.750 --> 01:56:09.462
because your parents are having
marital difficulties.

1674
01:56:25.395 --> 01:56:27.814
You can get a refund.
I hardly wore it at all.

1675
01:56:31.359 --> 01:56:33.612
Are you breaking up with me?

1676
01:56:33.612 --> 01:56:38.533
Not at prom.
but of course. eventually.

1677
01:56:41.286 --> 01:56:43.455
I'm gonna pray on it.

1678
01:56:43.455 --> 01:56:47.375
And I'm gonna pray
really. really hard for you

1679
01:56:47.375 --> 01:56:50.003
because you're such a fun boy
to kiss. but...

1680
01:56:51.504 --> 01:56:53.173
Thank you. Thank you.

1681
01:56:53.173 --> 01:56:55.675
Wonderful. Wonderful.

1682
01:56:55.675 --> 01:56:59.262
Let's thank our band
for that great music.

1683
01:56:59.262 --> 01:57:02.599
Sometimes we just can't
fix things. Sam...

1684
01:57:03.892 --> 01:57:07.854
...and all we can do is suffer.

1685
01:57:09.689 --> 01:57:12.400
Now we're gonna take
a little break from the dancing

1686
01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:16.529
for a very special moment
for the class of 1964.

1687
01:57:17.656 --> 01:57:21.701
Um. Mr. Samuel Fabelman.
where are you?

1688
01:57:21.701 --> 01:57:23.203
Where is he?

1689
01:57:24.037 --> 01:57:25.914
Okay.

1690
01:57:25.914 --> 01:57:27.207
Bagelman!

1691
01:57:27.207 --> 01:57:28.667
Bagelman!

1692
01:57:28.667 --> 01:57:30.377
- Okay. everybody.

1693
01:57:30.377 --> 01:57:32.212
- Face this way. Grab a chair.

1694
01:57:32.212 --> 01:57:34.381
Let's all get close
to the screen.

1695
01:57:35.548 --> 01:57:38.802
Right up front. Very good.

1696
01:57:40.053 --> 01:57:43.765
Mr. Fabelman.
this is your big moment.

1697
01:57:43.765 --> 01:57:49.646
We're ready to watch
your Technicolor masterpiece.

1698
01:57:49.646 --> 01:57:53.066
"Ditch Day 1964."

1699
01:57:57.153 --> 01:58:02.575
And as they say way down south
in Hollywoodland. "lights..."

1700
01:58:02.575 --> 01:58:06.746
Uh. "lights. camera. action!"

1701
01:59:57.565 --> 02:00:00.193
- Oh. no!

1702
02:00:29.931 --> 02:00:31.558
- Aw.

1703
02:01:41.044 --> 02:01:43.630
Whoo! Let's go! Come on!

1704
02:01:44.589 --> 02:01:47.383
No. no. no. no. no.

1705
02:01:49.052 --> 02:01:52.597
Logan. you were so incredible
up there.

1706
02:01:52.597 --> 02:01:54.599
It was amazing.

1707
02:02:27.382 --> 02:02:29.509
Why'd you do that?

1708
02:02:31.761 --> 02:02:33.638
What?

1709
02:02:33.638 --> 02:02:36.391
Why'd you make me
look like that?

1710
02:02:38.685 --> 02:02:41.062
- In the film?
- Yes. in the film!

1711
02:02:41.062 --> 02:02:43.398
Oh. shit! Shit.

1712
02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:46.192
What's the matter with you?

1713
02:02:46.192 --> 02:02:48.027
I've been a...
a total asshole to you.

1714
02:02:48.027 --> 02:02:50.029
- I broke your nose. and then...
- You didn't break my nose.

1715
02:02:50.029 --> 02:02:51.781
- Then you go and make me look
like-like that. -You almost--

1716
02:02:51.781 --> 02:02:53.533
- You didn't break it.
- What's wrong with you?

1717
02:02:53.533 --> 02:02:56.536
Logan. all I did was hold the
camera. and it saw what it saw.

1718
02:02:56.536 --> 02:02:59.372
Oh. bullshit! Fabelman.
you made me look like...

1719
02:02:59.372 --> 02:03:01.791
like this golden kind of thing.

1720
02:03:01.791 --> 02:03:03.209
- Yeah? -And Claudia.
she just kissed me.

1721
02:03:03.209 --> 02:03:05.003
- Mazel tov.
- In front of the whole school.

1722
02:03:05.003 --> 02:03:06.713
- Okay. great. -I treat her
shittier than I treat you.

1723
02:03:06.713 --> 02:03:08.631
- and now she wants to...
- You're welcome. man. Jesus...

1724
02:03:08.631 --> 02:03:11.509
No. no. Don't...
Don't go. Don't go.

1725
02:03:11.509 --> 02:03:14.554
I want to know why you did that.

1726
02:03:14.554 --> 02:03:16.556
I don't know. I ought to have
my head examined.

1727
02:03:16.556 --> 02:03:17.890
Am I supposed to feel bad now

1728
02:03:17.890 --> 02:03:19.517
about all that shit
we did to you?

1729
02:03:19.517 --> 02:03:20.810
Do you feel bad
about all that shit?

1730
02:03:20.810 --> 02:03:22.312
That's none of
your goddamn business!

1731
02:03:22.312 --> 02:03:24.230
-'Cause you should feel bad
about... -Oh. right!

1732
02:03:24.230 --> 02:03:25.898
That's why you did it. You want
me to feel like crap about...

1733
02:03:25.898 --> 02:03:28.693
I wanted you to be nice to me
for five minutes!

1734
02:03:28.693 --> 02:03:30.987
Or I did it
to make my movie better.

1735
02:03:30.987 --> 02:03:32.405
I don't know why.

1736
02:03:32.405 --> 02:03:36.075
You are the biggest jerk
I've ever met in my entire life.

1737
02:03:36.075 --> 02:03:39.579
I have a monkey at home
that's smarter than you!

1738
02:03:39.579 --> 02:03:43.708
You dumb. anti-Semitic asshole!

1739
02:03:43.708 --> 02:03:46.127
I made you look like
you could fly.

1740
02:03:47.128 --> 02:03:48.838
But I can't fly.

1741
02:03:48.838 --> 02:03:51.049
I can outrun any guy
in Santa Clara County.

1742
02:03:51.049 --> 02:03:52.925
and I worked real hard
to do that.

1743
02:03:52.925 --> 02:03:55.595
But you... you make me feel
like I'm some kind of failure

1744
02:03:55.595 --> 02:03:57.805
or a phony or...
or like I'm supposed to be

1745
02:03:57.805 --> 02:04:00.558
some guy I'm never gonna be.
not even in my dreams.

1746
02:04:00.558 --> 02:04:02.018
You took that guy.
whoever he is.

1747
02:04:02.018 --> 02:04:03.936
wherever you got him from.
and you put him up there

1748
02:04:03.936 --> 02:04:06.064
on that screen
and told everyone...

1749
02:04:06.064 --> 02:04:07.482
everyone that that's me.

1750
02:04:07.482 --> 02:04:09.776
And that's not me.
That's... It's...

1751
02:04:11.569 --> 02:04:15.114
Goddamn it. Goddamn it.

1752
02:04:18.618 --> 02:04:20.662
Jesus. it wasn't supposed
to make you upset.

1753
02:04:20.662 --> 02:04:22.705
I didn't mean to freak you out.
I didn't mean...

1754
02:04:22.705 --> 02:04:25.500
Who cares what you meant?

1755
02:04:26.626 --> 02:04:28.795
Fabelman!

1756
02:04:30.213 --> 02:04:31.589
Oh. shit.

1757
02:04:31.589 --> 02:04:32.715
You liar! You backstabbing liar!

1758
02:04:32.715 --> 02:04:34.967
I'm gonna beat your...

1759
02:04:46.813 --> 02:04:48.815
You totally bought it.
his whole snow job.

1760
02:04:48.815 --> 02:04:51.109
You ate it up. You moron.

1761
02:04:51.109 --> 02:04:53.778
Logan. you are so conceited
and dumb.

1762
02:05:19.053 --> 02:05:21.764
Is something about to happen?

1763
02:05:22.765 --> 02:05:24.684
You like living dangerously.
Fabelman.

1764
02:05:24.684 --> 02:05:26.519
No. I don't.
I really. really don't.

1765
02:05:26.519 --> 02:05:28.146
Yes. you do.

1766
02:05:28.146 --> 02:05:32.066
But you tell anybody
about me getting. um...

1767
02:05:32.066 --> 02:05:35.737
upset. that would be a mistake.

1768
02:05:38.030 --> 02:05:39.532
Our secret.

1769
02:05:39.532 --> 02:05:41.200
Okay?

1770
02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:42.994
Definitely.

1771
02:05:46.539 --> 02:05:48.875
Unless I make a movie about it.

1772
02:05:50.001 --> 02:05:52.712
Which I'm never ever gonna do.

1773
02:06:18.237 --> 02:06:20.156
You never...

1774
02:06:21.324 --> 02:06:23.159
What's it like?

1775
02:06:24.911 --> 02:06:28.247
It kind of shows you how
out of control everything is

1776
02:06:28.247 --> 02:06:32.794
and how y-you're not
in charge of anything.

1777
02:06:35.338 --> 02:06:37.548
A-And how it doesn't matter.

1778
02:06:37.548 --> 02:06:39.258
I better not.

1779
02:06:40.259 --> 02:06:43.137
In my head. everything's
already out of control.

1780
02:06:45.598 --> 02:06:47.767
- You're full of shit.

1781
02:06:47.767 --> 02:06:50.603
I got to split.
Claudia's waiting for me.

1782
02:06:55.817 --> 02:06:59.445
Life's nothing like the movies.
Fabelman.

1783
02:06:59.445 --> 02:07:00.780
Maybe not.

1784
02:07:00.780 --> 02:07:03.366
But hey. in the end...

1785
02:07:03.366 --> 02:07:05.618
you got the girl.

1786
02:07:28.516 --> 02:07:31.394
Must have been some night.

1787
02:07:33.938 --> 02:07:36.357
Did Monica like the corsage?

1788
02:07:36.357 --> 02:07:39.735
- Yeah.
- Well. I told you she would.

1789
02:07:47.660 --> 02:07:49.912
That time when I hit you...

1790
02:07:49.912 --> 02:07:52.874
In-in Phoenix. when I...

1791
02:07:52.874 --> 02:07:55.501
Oh. God. You remember.

1792
02:07:56.961 --> 02:07:59.046
Not really.

1793
02:07:59.046 --> 02:08:00.965
Oh. for the love of God.
it's not like

1794
02:08:00.965 --> 02:08:03.426
I spent my whole life
hitting you.

1795
02:08:03.426 --> 02:08:06.053
Once. I hit you once.

1796
02:08:06.053 --> 02:08:07.680
It should've been memorable.

1797
02:08:07.680 --> 02:08:09.181
Before the swimming test.

1798
02:08:09.181 --> 02:08:11.183
Yes. before the swimming test!

1799
02:08:11.183 --> 02:08:13.519
Yes. Well. I-I...

1800
02:08:13.519 --> 02:08:16.898
I s-slapped you on your back...

1801
02:08:18.024 --> 02:08:20.192
...as hard as I could.
I screwed up your tryouts.

1802
02:08:20.192 --> 02:08:22.028
and you-you couldn't get
your merit badge.

1803
02:08:22.028 --> 02:08:23.571
and then you couldn't make
Eagle Scout.

1804
02:08:23.571 --> 02:08:25.114
- Ma. I made Eagle Scout.
- And I...

1805
02:08:25.114 --> 02:08:27.158
- It wasn't a big deal.
- Well. I left a goddamn mark

1806
02:08:27.158 --> 02:08:30.036
on your skin
in the sh-shape of my hand.

1807
02:08:30.036 --> 02:08:32.371
And I need you to say
you forgive me for doing that.

1808
02:08:32.371 --> 02:08:35.958
- Well. okay. I forgive you.
- Because... Because...

1809
02:08:37.209 --> 02:08:39.211
- Because you're my kid.
- Mom. I forgive you.

1810
02:08:39.211 --> 02:08:41.213
And-and-and my kids
mean more to me than...

1811
02:08:41.213 --> 02:08:43.215
- Mom. I forgive you.
- ...anything else on the Earth.

1812
02:08:43.215 --> 02:08:44.884
- I forgive you.
- Because...

1813
02:08:44.884 --> 02:08:47.219
Please. please. Because how
am I ever gonna forgive myself?

1814
02:08:47.219 --> 02:08:49.597
- I can't.
- Mom. I-I-I...

1815
02:08:49.597 --> 02:08:51.057
I forgive you.

1816
02:08:51.057 --> 02:08:53.017
The eggs are burning.

1817
02:08:53.017 --> 02:08:55.645
Oh. God.

1818
02:08:59.899 --> 02:09:02.944
I'm doing this thing.

1819
02:09:03.903 --> 02:09:06.405
And I-I don't know
if it's the right thing.

1820
02:09:06.405 --> 02:09:09.033
but it's a life-and-death
thing for me.

1821
02:09:09.033 --> 02:09:11.494
And I'm sorry.
but everybody else

1822
02:09:11.494 --> 02:09:13.829
is gonna have to hang on
for dear life.

1823
02:09:13.829 --> 02:09:15.915
And somehow.

1824
02:09:15.915 --> 02:09:19.502
we will survive this. all of us.

1825
02:09:19.502 --> 02:09:22.588
Even your father.
who I adore with all my heart.

1826
02:09:22.588 --> 02:09:26.759
He deserves so much better
than what I'm doing. but...

1827
02:09:29.804 --> 02:09:32.598
...but Bennie needs me. dolly.

1828
02:09:32.598 --> 02:09:34.767
And I need him.

1829
02:09:34.767 --> 02:09:36.268
So much so that without him.

1830
02:09:36.268 --> 02:09:38.145
I'm turning into someone
I don't know

1831
02:09:38.145 --> 02:09:41.190
and none of you
will know me anymore.

1832
02:09:41.190 --> 02:09:43.109
I'll just be that hateful person

1833
02:09:43.109 --> 02:09:45.111
who did that terrible thing
to your back.

1834
02:09:45.111 --> 02:09:49.281
And yes. this is the most
selfish thing I have ever done.

1835
02:09:49.281 --> 02:09:53.119
but I've got to do this now
because. Sammy...

1836
02:09:54.412 --> 02:09:57.456
...you do what your heart
says you have to.

1837
02:09:57.456 --> 02:10:00.459
'cause you don't owe anyone
your life.

1838
02:10:01.669 --> 02:10:03.629
Not even me.

1839
02:10:09.802 --> 02:10:11.846
Oh... Are they ruined?

1840
02:10:11.846 --> 02:10:14.807
I-I-I can make some more.

1841
02:10:14.807 --> 02:10:16.517
Oh. no. no. no.

1842
02:10:16.517 --> 02:10:18.227
I like 'em burnt.

1843
02:10:22.148 --> 02:10:24.316
So. Monica dumped me.

1844
02:10:24.316 --> 02:10:26.110
She did?

1845
02:10:26.110 --> 02:10:28.821
Yeah. after I told her
about the divorce.

1846
02:10:29.655 --> 02:10:31.240
Huh?

1847
02:10:32.158 --> 02:10:34.785
Probably shouldn't have
asked her to marry me.

1848
02:10:34.785 --> 02:10:36.912
- You did not.
- Oh. but...

1849
02:10:36.912 --> 02:10:39.498
- Oh. You did?

1850
02:10:40.541 --> 02:10:44.086
- In so many words.
-Poor girl.

1851
02:11:05.441 --> 02:11:06.859
Dad?

1852
02:11:10.613 --> 02:11:12.865
Hey. Dad. I'm home.

1853
02:11:23.918 --> 02:11:25.836
Sammy?

1854
02:11:31.550 --> 02:11:33.886
I think I'm having
a heart attack.

1855
02:11:39.558 --> 02:11:41.727
- Come here.

1856
02:11:50.236 --> 02:11:52.238
It's a panic attack.
Your mother gets them.

1857
02:11:52.238 --> 02:11:54.782
- What did you do when she'd
get them? -I made her tea.

1858
02:11:54.782 --> 02:11:56.325
Okay.

1859
02:12:02.206 --> 02:12:05.084
Plus. you're exhausted.

1860
02:12:05.084 --> 02:12:07.086
You don't sleep.

1861
02:12:07.086 --> 02:12:08.921
I hear you walking around
all night

1862
02:12:08.921 --> 02:12:10.381
or typing those letters.

1863
02:12:10.381 --> 02:12:12.007
and the three hours' drive
to the college

1864
02:12:12.007 --> 02:12:13.884
- every day and back. it's...
- Oh. no. no. no.

1865
02:12:13.884 --> 02:12:15.427
I can't go back to that dorm.

1866
02:12:15.427 --> 02:12:17.096
Maybe your roommate
settled down.

1867
02:12:17.096 --> 02:12:18.639
He voted for Goldwater.

1868
02:12:18.639 --> 02:12:20.641
I can't go back.

1869
02:12:20.641 --> 02:12:22.017
Dad...

1870
02:12:24.937 --> 02:12:27.106
I don't know...

1871
02:12:27.106 --> 02:12:29.275
what to do anymore.

1872
02:12:30.234 --> 02:12:32.194
I don't want to disappoint you.

1873
02:12:32.194 --> 02:12:35.489
and I promised
that I'd stick it out.

1874
02:12:35.489 --> 02:12:38.325
but two years is like forever.
and I hate school.

1875
02:12:38.325 --> 02:12:40.578
- Like. a lot.

1876
02:12:40.578 --> 02:12:45.374
And I want to get work
on a movie or a TV show.

1877
02:12:45.374 --> 02:12:47.293
so I send out all those letters.

1878
02:12:47.293 --> 02:12:49.295
but nobody ever writes back.

1879
02:12:49.295 --> 02:12:51.797
And my life is just
going by so fast.

1880
02:12:51.797 --> 02:12:54.008
but it's not getting anywhere.

1881
02:12:56.385 --> 02:12:59.221
Concentrate on sipping.
It'll calm you down.

1882
02:13:04.560 --> 02:13:06.812
Here. Uh...

1883
02:13:09.356 --> 02:13:12.318
You can go through the mail
while I get the soup hot.

1884
02:13:34.048 --> 02:13:36.383
It's from Mom.

1885
02:13:37.426 --> 02:13:39.428
It's just a bunch
of goofy photos

1886
02:13:39.428 --> 02:13:41.263
from some kind of block party.

1887
02:14:27.685 --> 02:14:29.478
Dad?

1888
02:14:31.730 --> 02:14:33.482
Dad. what's...

1889
02:14:42.992 --> 02:14:45.077
Oh. Dad. I didn't mean to...

1890
02:14:45.077 --> 02:14:47.621
If you hate school so much.
don't go.

1891
02:14:48.747 --> 02:14:50.582
But... Dad. we need...

1892
02:14:50.582 --> 02:14:52.293
I don't know.
I would like you to

1893
02:14:52.293 --> 02:14:54.336
because this film thing...
I don't know.

1894
02:14:54.336 --> 02:14:56.588
Maybe I should have
put my foot down about it

1895
02:14:56.588 --> 02:14:59.258
years ago. but...

1896
02:15:00.801 --> 02:15:04.221
I know you're gonna work
like the dickens

1897
02:15:04.221 --> 02:15:05.931
on whatever you wind up doing

1898
02:15:05.931 --> 02:15:09.101
because you're a chip
off the old block.

1899
02:15:13.772 --> 02:15:17.359
We're never not going to know
each other. Sammy.

1900
02:15:20.779 --> 02:15:23.324
How do you know that?

1901
02:15:23.324 --> 02:15:25.159
You and Mom don't anymore.

1902
02:15:25.159 --> 02:15:27.286
Yes. we do.

1903
02:15:28.203 --> 02:15:30.372
We always will.

1904
02:15:31.290 --> 02:15:33.751
I know it because...

1905
02:15:35.544 --> 02:15:37.880
...we've gone too far
in our story

1906
02:15:37.880 --> 02:15:41.133
to actually say "the end."

1907
02:15:50.476 --> 02:15:52.895
Uh. you missed something
in the mail.

1908
02:16:19.713 --> 02:16:21.548
Good news?

1909
02:16:24.343 --> 02:16:26.678
They've ordered 32 half hours.

1910
02:16:26.678 --> 02:16:30.182
Fridays at 8:30 p.m. on CBS.
starting September 17th.

1911
02:16:30.182 --> 02:16:31.892
We already have six shows
in the can.

1912
02:16:31.892 --> 02:16:34.311
It's like Stalag 17
or The Great Escape.

1913
02:16:34.311 --> 02:16:36.021
- except it's funnier.
- Mm.

1914
02:16:36.021 --> 02:16:37.439
And it's for television.

1915
02:16:37.439 --> 02:16:38.857
- And it's funny.
- Yeah.

1916
02:16:38.857 --> 02:16:40.734
Or at least I pray to God
that it's funny.

1917
02:16:40.734 --> 02:16:42.528
Hogan's Heroes--
that's the title.

1918
02:16:42.528 --> 02:16:43.987
What do you think?

1919
02:16:43.987 --> 02:16:46.323
- Pretty catchy. right?
- Catchy. Yeah.

1920
02:16:46.323 --> 02:16:48.033
And if all goes well.

1921
02:16:48.033 --> 02:16:52.621
I might be able to offer you
something next season.

1922
02:16:53.414 --> 02:16:56.458
Maybe assisting an assistant
to an assistant.

1923
02:17:01.380 --> 02:17:03.298
You don't want to be
in TV anyway.

1924
02:17:03.298 --> 02:17:06.510
Um. your letter said as much.

1925
02:17:06.510 --> 02:17:08.804
By the way. I love this letter.

1926
02:17:08.804 --> 02:17:10.764
- Oh.
- I used to write a whole bunch

1927
02:17:10.764 --> 02:17:12.474
of these letters
when I was your age.

1928
02:17:12.474 --> 02:17:15.018
You want to make movies.
Am I right?

1929
02:17:15.018 --> 02:17:16.562
Well. yeah. Yes. I do.

1930
02:17:16.562 --> 02:17:18.939
But look. I'm just happy
to start anywhere.

1931
02:17:18.939 --> 02:17:20.732
- and-and that doesn't...

1932
02:17:20.732 --> 02:17:22.568
You know who you need to meet?

1933
02:17:22.568 --> 02:17:25.404
I mean. not for a job.
'cause he doesn't do that.

1934
02:17:25.404 --> 02:17:27.406
How would you like to meet

1935
02:17:27.406 --> 02:17:30.409
the greatest film director
who ever lived?

1936
02:17:30.409 --> 02:17:32.870
And he's right across the hall.

1937
02:17:34.913 --> 02:17:36.623
Come on.

1938
02:17:41.420 --> 02:17:43.380
Wait here a minute.

1939
02:17:52.473 --> 02:17:54.600
Um. this is Nona.

1940
02:17:54.600 --> 02:17:56.393
Nona's gonna look after you.

1941
02:17:56.393 --> 02:17:57.769
Um. he's not here. He's...

1942
02:17:57.769 --> 02:17:59.188
- He's at lunch.
- Right.

1943
02:17:59.188 --> 02:18:01.273
- You want to wait?
- Yeah. he'll wait.

1944
02:18:01.273 --> 02:18:03.025
Sit.

1945
02:18:04.109 --> 02:18:05.819
Good luck.

1946
02:18:11.283 --> 02:18:12.993
Could be hours.

1947
02:19:41.707 --> 02:19:44.710
All right. kid.
you got five minutes.

1948
02:19:44.710 --> 02:19:46.920
Probably one. Stand up.

1949
02:19:50.424 --> 02:19:52.426
Hey. L-Lose the tie.

1950
02:19:52.426 --> 02:19:54.678
You'll stand a better chance.

1951
02:21:04.247 --> 02:21:07.125
They tell me you want to be
a picture maker.

1952
02:21:08.460 --> 02:21:10.629
Um. yes. sir. I do.

1953
02:21:10.629 --> 02:21:12.464
Why?

1954
02:21:12.464 --> 02:21:15.050
This business.
it'll rip you apart.

1955
02:21:15.050 --> 02:21:17.594
W-Well...

1956
02:21:18.970 --> 02:21:20.138
Mr. Ford. I...

1957
02:21:20.138 --> 02:21:22.474
So. what do you know
about art. kid?

1958
02:21:24.810 --> 02:21:26.478
I-I love your movies so much.

1959
02:21:26.478 --> 02:21:28.480
No. Art.

1960
02:21:28.480 --> 02:21:30.982
See that painting over there?

1961
02:21:33.151 --> 02:21:35.153
Uh. yeah. I mean yes.

1962
02:21:35.153 --> 02:21:36.655
Yes. I do see it.

1963
02:21:36.655 --> 02:21:38.532
Walk over to it.

1964
02:21:44.413 --> 02:21:47.374
Well. what's in it? Describe it.

1965
02:21:47.374 --> 02:21:49.251
Oh. okay. Um...

1966
02:21:49.251 --> 02:21:51.253
So. there are two guys.

1967
02:21:51.253 --> 02:21:53.505
and they're on horseback.

1968
02:21:53.505 --> 02:21:55.257
and they're looking
for something.

1969
02:21:55.257 --> 02:21:56.508
So maybe they're scouting...

1970
02:21:56.508 --> 02:21:58.635
No. No.

1971
02:21:58.635 --> 02:22:00.637
Where's the horizon?

1972
02:22:00.637 --> 02:22:02.848
The-the horizon?

1973
02:22:02.848 --> 02:22:05.350
- Where is it?
- Yeah. it's at the bottom.

1974
02:22:05.350 --> 02:22:07.018
That's right.

1975
02:22:07.018 --> 02:22:09.688
Walk over to this painting.

1976
02:22:15.694 --> 02:22:17.070
Well?

1977
02:22:18.697 --> 02:22:20.782
Right. okay.
So. there are five cowboys.

1978
02:22:20.782 --> 02:22:22.951
- You know. they could be
Indian... -No. no. no. no. no!

1979
02:22:22.951 --> 02:22:24.745
Where's the goddamn horizon?

1980
02:22:24.745 --> 02:22:26.538
Um. it's-it's there.

1981
02:22:26.538 --> 02:22:28.457
- Where?
- At the top of the painting.

1982
02:22:28.457 --> 02:22:30.292
All right. get over here.

1983
02:22:32.502 --> 02:22:34.713
Now. remember this.

1984
02:22:34.713 --> 02:22:37.090
When the horizon's
at the bottom.

1985
02:22:37.090 --> 02:22:38.967
it's interesting.

1986
02:22:38.967 --> 02:22:41.428
When the horizon's at the top.

1987
02:22:41.428 --> 02:22:43.555
it's interesting.

1988
02:22:43.555 --> 02:22:45.599
When the horizon's
in the middle.

1989
02:22:45.599 --> 02:22:48.560
it's boring as shit.

1990
02:22:48.560 --> 02:22:51.313
Now. good luck to you.

1991
02:22:52.189 --> 02:22:54.816
And get the fuck out
of my office!

1992
02:22:54.816 --> 02:22:56.777
Okay.

1993
02:23:00.405 --> 02:23:02.073
Thank you.

1994
02:23:03.074 --> 02:23:04.993
My pleasure.
