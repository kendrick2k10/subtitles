LESLIE:

Yes. I'm doing intake

26
00:01:55.767 --> 00:01:57.552
with a new resident
and her two children.

27
00:01:57.595 --> 00:01:59.902
Shit. It's my fault.
My voice carries.

28
00:01:59.945 --> 00:02:02.209
Me too.
Sorry. Evelyn.

29
00:02:02.252 --> 00:02:03.340
We'll try
to keep it down.

30
00:02:03.384 --> 00:02:04.689

There's a tajine
in the oven.

35
00:02:55.914 --> 00:02:58.090
Did you have
a good day?

36
00:02:58.134 --> 00:03:00.180
Ah. a woman came
into the shelter today.

37
00:03:00.223 --> 00:03:04.314
She was about 26.
her kids were eight and four.

38
00:03:04.358 --> 00:03:06.273
Last night.
her husband came home

39
00:03:06.316 --> 00:03:07.970
and locked the kids
in the basement

40
00:03:08.013 --> 00:03:10.625
while he assaulted
their mother upstairs.

41
00:03:10.668 --> 00:03:14.194
The police came
and only spoke to the husband.

42
00:03:14.237 --> 00:03:16.065
Luckily.
the eight year old

43
00:03:16.108 --> 00:03:17.762
recorded the audio
on his phone.

44
00:03:17.806 --> 00:03:22.550
So. you know.
every cloud. right?

45
00:03:22.593 --> 00:03:24.247
How was your day.
my dear?

46
00:03:24.291 --> 00:03:26.380
It was
very productive.

00:03:26.423 --> 00:03:27.859

00:04:37.407 --> 00:04:38.713
while I was

Ah. motherfucker.

73
00:04:45.981 --> 00:04:47.199
Dad?

74
00:04:47.243 --> 00:04:48.375
Yeah?Did Mom try
to open the door

75
00:04:48.418 --> 00:04:49.463
while I was
live streaming?

76
00:04:49.506 --> 00:04:51.334
ROGER:
I don't know.
ask her.

77
00:04:51.378 --> 00:04:55.164
Mom. did you open my door
while I was... Shit! Sorry.

78
00:04:55.207 --> 00:04:56.992
Did you try to open the door
while I was live streaming?

79
00:04:57.035 --> 00:04:58.341
I'm taking
a shower. Ziggy.

80
00:04:58.385 --> 00:04:59.429
Did you?

81
00:04:59.473 --> 00:05:01.083
What's
"live streaming?"

82
00:05:01.126 --> 00:05:02.606
Where I basically
make all my money.

83
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:03.738
Where thousands of kids

84
00:05:03.781 --> 00:05:04.869
who are desperate
to hear me perform

85
00:05:04.913 --> 00:05:07.176
log on every week
and tip me and upnote me

86
00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:08.873
and I'm one of the highest
performers on the site.

87
00:05:08.917 --> 00:05:10.048
Well.
that all sounds

88
00:05:10.092 --> 00:05:11.572
very impressive.It is.

89
00:05:11.615 --> 00:05:13.748
And. uh. what do you
plan on doing

90
00:05:13.791 --> 00:05:15.358
with all that
hard-earned money?

91
00:05:15.402 --> 00:05:16.968
Uh. spend it.

92
00:05:17.012 --> 00:05:18.448
On what. my child?

93
00:05:18.492 --> 00:05:20.189
I don't know.
Probably a new guitar

94
00:05:20.232 --> 00:05:22.583
and a new mic and probably
a better translation software.

95
00:05:22.626 --> 00:05:24.062
because I want to play
for African kids

96
00:05:24.106 --> 00:05:26.064
and they have like a hundred
different languages there.

97
00:05:26.108 --> 00:05:28.415
So you're going to use
the money you make

98
00:05:28.458 --> 00:05:30.068
from playing your songs

99
00:05:30.112 --> 00:05:33.071
to buy more equipment
to play your songs?

100
00:05:33.115 --> 00:05:34.812
Yeah.

101
00:05:34.856 --> 00:05:36.248
Well. that's
a tautological nightmare.

102
00:05:36.292 --> 00:05:37.337
don't you think?

103
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.773
What?

104
00:05:38.816 --> 00:05:41.428
Well. it sounds like
you're on an exhausting loop.

105
00:05:41.471 --> 00:05:43.604
Have you thought
about an endgame?

106
00:05:43.647 --> 00:05:44.996
Oh. an endgame?

107
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.171
I don't know.
I'm gonna be rich

108
00:05:46.215 --> 00:05:47.347
and you're gonna be poor?

109
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.653
Oh. you're
going to be rich?

110
00:05:49.697 --> 00:05:51.829
And I'm going
to be poor?

111
00:05:51.873 --> 00:05:54.049
Yeah. just don't
open my door again.

112
00:05:54.092 --> 00:05:55.964
When you're live streaming?ZIGGY: Right.

113
00:05:56.007 --> 00:05:57.400
Right.

114
00:06:05.234 --> 00:06:07.758
Hmm.And the hearts of palm.

115
00:06:07.802 --> 00:06:09.934
Wow. Where'd
you get the chicken?

116
00:06:09.978 --> 00:06:11.632
Patsy's farm.

117
00:06:11.675 --> 00:06:14.591
She also had a surplus
of tomatoes. which I bought.

118
00:06:14.635 --> 00:06:16.506
Oh. very good.

119
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.421
I'll make a gazpacho
tomorrow.

120
00:06:18.465 --> 00:06:20.380
I mean. it's basically
giving the guitar away.

121
00:06:20.423 --> 00:06:22.556
To get a Strat
from that year
at that price

122
00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:23.948
is basically free.
you know?

123
00:06:23.992 --> 00:06:25.776
Just make sure
you don't play the blues!

124
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.256
What?

125
00:06:27.299 --> 00:06:29.040
You don't play
blues music. do you?

126
00:06:29.084 --> 00:06:30.607
No. I play folk rock.

127
00:06:30.651 --> 00:06:33.001
Classic folk rock
with alternative influences.

128
00:06:33.044 --> 00:06:34.306
I don't know
what that means.

129
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:35.743
Well...

130
00:06:35.786 --> 00:06:37.092
I could play it for you.

131
00:06:37.135 --> 00:06:38.702
I just debuted
a new song.
Truthaches.

132
00:06:38.746 --> 00:06:40.748
I could show it to you.What did you
say it's called?

133
00:06:40.791 --> 00:06:42.184
Did you say Truthaches?

134
00:06:42.227 --> 00:06:44.795
Yeah.
Do you want to hear it?

135
00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:46.449
Well. I'm assuming
that we're

136
00:06:46.493 --> 00:06:48.495
not your
target audience.ZIGGY: Right.

137
00:06:48.538 --> 00:06:51.193
I mean. it's geared
towards teenagers.
am I right?

138
00:06:51.236 --> 00:06:52.455
Yeah. I... Sure.

139
00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:54.675
Because it's
incredibly unethical...

140
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.765
White people
playing blues music.

141
00:06:57.808 --> 00:06:59.462
Did you ever read
Amiri Baraka?

142
00:06:59.506 --> 00:07:00.681
Who?Roger. please.

143
00:07:00.724 --> 00:07:02.509
Because he's very explicit
on the issue

144
00:07:02.552 --> 00:07:04.728
of cultural
appropriation.Jesus Christ. Roger!

145
00:07:04.772 --> 00:07:06.556
Dad. I don't play
blues music.

146
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.862
God. just shut
the fuck up.

147
00:07:07.905 --> 00:07:09.559
Okay. okay!
I was just...

148
00:07:09.603 --> 00:07:11.169
I was just saying.

149
00:07:34.845 --> 00:07:36.717
Hey. Mom.
can you drive me today?

150
00:07:37.674 --> 00:07:39.328
Are you ready
to go now?

151
00:07:39.371 --> 00:07:41.373
Yeah. just give me.
like. five seconds.

152
00:08:34.557 --> 00:08:35.863
You're
on the city council.

153
00:08:35.906 --> 00:08:37.386
how difficult is it

154
00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:38.605
to get some goddamn painters
in here. Homer?

155
00:08:38.648 --> 00:08:40.171
We have women coming in.
it's the middle of

156
00:08:40.215 --> 00:08:41.608
the goddamn night. they have
nowhere to park their cars.

157
00:08:41.651 --> 00:08:43.740
We're talking about two white
lines on the fucking asphalt.

158
00:08:44.872 --> 00:08:46.308
Um. Ms. Katz?

159
00:08:46.351 --> 00:08:48.876
I just wanted
to let you know
I just did outtake.

160
00:08:50.094 --> 00:08:51.966
Hold on
a second. Homer.

161
00:08:52.009 --> 00:08:53.489
Yeah. I'm going home.

162
00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:54.795
Well. to my sisters.

163
00:08:54.838 --> 00:08:57.101
but I'm getting
out of here.

164
00:08:57.145 --> 00:08:58.363
Yay. me!

165
00:08:58.407 --> 00:08:59.713
That's wonderful. dear!

166
00:08:59.756 --> 00:09:01.410
Can I give you a hug?

167
00:09:01.453 --> 00:09:02.716
Um. yes. Of course.

168
00:09:08.983 --> 00:09:11.028
You saved my life.

169
00:09:11.072 --> 00:09:12.987
You saved my daughter's life.

170
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:16.033
I'm very proud of you. dear.
Very proud of you.

171
00:09:22.431 --> 00:09:23.650
I'm sorry
about that. Homer.

172
00:09:23.693 --> 00:09:24.912
What?LILA: No. no. no.

173
00:09:24.955 --> 00:09:26.914
The US not only ignores
human rights abuses.

174
00:09:26.957 --> 00:09:30.134
but they purposely.
maliciously profit off them!

175
00:09:30.178 --> 00:09:31.309
And the worst offense

176
00:09:31.353 --> 00:09:33.224
is this sanctimonious.
savior complex

177
00:09:33.268 --> 00:09:35.662
where we're distributing
our morally superior values

178
00:09:35.705 --> 00:09:36.924
to the unwashed masses.

179
00:09:36.967 --> 00:09:38.316
like they're just.
sitting around the desert

180
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.058
waiting for someone
to descend from the heavens.

181
00:09:41.102 --> 00:09:42.364
But what
would you rather.

182
00:09:42.407 --> 00:09:43.757
for China to swoop in?

183
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.410
Or maybe Russia?

184
00:09:45.454 --> 00:09:48.152
Or maybe some other
amoral actor?

185
00:09:48.196 --> 00:09:49.371
It's not like
the US steps out...

186
00:09:49.414 --> 00:09:50.764
Yo. Z.
you want a hit?

187
00:09:50.807 --> 00:09:52.069
No. Shut up.
I'm trying to listen.

188
00:09:52.113 --> 00:09:53.418
CYRI:
...starts handing out
free bread.

189
00:09:53.462 --> 00:09:54.506
By that logic.

190
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:56.117
we should just occupy
every country

191
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.814
that might be
at a slight risk
of intervention

192
00:09:57.858 --> 00:09:59.642
because
we're the bastion

193
00:09:59.686 --> 00:10:01.252
of peace
and equity.Yeah. I feel like...

194
00:10:01.296 --> 00:10:02.906
Thank you for
making my point.

195
00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:04.429
I was
being sarcastic.BECKY: Oh. no. Don't do this.

196
00:10:04.473 --> 00:10:06.649
So was I.
Thank you.LILA: You're infuriating!

197
00:10:06.693 --> 00:10:08.216
Yo. I agree
with you. Lila.

198
00:10:08.259 --> 00:10:11.915
Thank you. Ziggy!
See. someone's got my back!

199
00:10:11.959 --> 00:10:13.656
Yeah. of course. man.

200
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:14.962
Uh. huh. Yeah.LILA: Yeah. Very.

201
00:10:15.005 --> 00:10:16.050
How?

202
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:17.965
What?

203
00:10:18.008 --> 00:10:19.531
How do you
agree with Lila?

204
00:10:20.794 --> 00:10:22.360
Oh. shit. yeah.

205
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.232
Um...

206
00:10:26.234 --> 00:10:27.670
Well. you mentioned
China. right?

207
00:10:27.714 --> 00:10:29.106
Yeah.

208
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:32.544
Cause I play music for these
Chinese girls on Hi-Hat.

209
00:10:32.588 --> 00:10:35.504
I actually have
like 20.000 followers.

210
00:10:35.547 --> 00:10:38.072
and I'm in the
top percentage
of performers. I'm...

211
00:10:38.115 --> 00:10:39.464
I'm validated
and I'm starred.

212
00:10:39.508 --> 00:10:40.814
which is tera
hard to get.

213
00:10:40.857 --> 00:10:42.903
And. like. the girls
I play for are super dope.

214
00:10:42.946 --> 00:10:45.688
There's this one girl.
SeaKitten. that's her handle.

215
00:10:45.732 --> 00:10:46.950
who tipped me
20 credits last week...

216
00:10:48.299 --> 00:10:49.474
...after I wished her
a happy birthday so...

217
00:10:51.563 --> 00:10:53.348
So. I guess. just in terms
for what you're saying. Lila.

218
00:10:53.391 --> 00:10:54.741
like. I totally
agree with you.

219
00:10:56.699 --> 00:10:58.092
BECKY:
A stirring defense!

220
00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:01.312
Becky. don't
be a dick.

221
00:11:10.104 --> 00:11:11.801
Ladies.WOMAN 1: Oh. hey.

222
00:11:14.761 --> 00:11:18.460
And he's not a big guy
and he wasn't even drunk.

223
00:11:18.503 --> 00:11:20.897
but he's got his hands
around my neck.

224
00:11:20.941 --> 00:11:22.638
Was this the first time
he did this?

225
00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:24.509
Well. it was the first time
that day.

226
00:11:25.946 --> 00:11:29.689
Then. he just kind of gets up.
He says he's got to go pee.

227
00:11:29.732 --> 00:11:31.647
Mmm-hmm. And then
you called the police?

228
00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:33.475
No. I didn't call the police.

229
00:11:33.518 --> 00:11:35.259
Oh. Um...

230
00:11:35.303 --> 00:11:36.696
It says. uh...

231
00:11:36.739 --> 00:11:38.872
Sergeant McKenna
brought you in. I thought...

232
00:11:38.915 --> 00:11:41.526
Oh.ANGIE: Right. well.
Kyle called the police.

233
00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:43.790
Yeah. uh. I called them.

234
00:11:43.833 --> 00:11:45.139
Eh. where were you?

235
00:11:45.182 --> 00:11:46.749
I was just next door
at Sean's.

236
00:11:46.793 --> 00:11:48.577
Yeah.
his friend Sean's.

237
00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.057
They've been
friends since...Right...

238
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.362
Whatever....forever. Like...

239
00:11:51.406 --> 00:11:54.191
So she
texted me. and. uh.
I ran back home.

240
00:11:54.235 --> 00:11:55.758
How old
are you. Kyle?

241
00:11:55.802 --> 00:11:56.803
Seventeen.

242
00:11:57.717 --> 00:11:58.805
He's my little

You're the only
good thing in my life.

246
00:12:02.547 --> 00:12:03.853
Thank you.It's true.

247
00:12:03.897 --> 00:12:04.985
It's true.
kids are just
pure love.

248
00:12:05.028 --> 00:12:06.247
Do you know
what I mean?

249
00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:07.639
Mmm-hmm.

250
00:12:07.683 --> 00:12:11.339
You know. when he was just
six years old. um. Ms...

251
00:12:11.382 --> 00:12:12.993
I'm sorry.
what's your
name again?

252
00:12:13.036 --> 00:12:14.168
I'm Evelyn.

253
00:12:14.211 --> 00:12:15.299
Evelyn.

254
00:12:15.343 --> 00:12:16.387
Shit. I'm sorry.

255
00:12:16.431 --> 00:12:18.781
Well. when Kyle
was six years old.

256
00:12:18.825 --> 00:12:20.261
his father hits me

257
00:12:20.304 --> 00:12:22.524
and I get this nasty cut
over my eyebrow.

258
00:12:22.567 --> 00:12:25.701
and I didn't even know
that Kyle knew anything.

259
00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:29.270
I mean. who knows what
kids know about their parents?

260
00:12:29.313 --> 00:12:30.837
But. anyway.
he comes into the room.

261
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.012
he says he's had a bad dream.

262
00:12:32.055 --> 00:12:33.187
can I come
and stay in his bed?

263
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:34.449
Mom. stop.

264
00:12:34.492 --> 00:12:36.886
No. she needs
to hear this. okay?

265
00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:38.192
So. anyways.
we're laying in bed

266
00:12:38.235 --> 00:12:39.454
and I just whisper to him.

267
00:12:39.497 --> 00:12:41.630
"Do you want to tell me
about your nightmare?"

268
00:12:41.673 --> 00:12:43.545
And he says.
"I didn't have a nightmare."

269
00:12:45.286 --> 00:12:48.898
He just knew I needed to get
out of that room. you know?

270
00:12:48.942 --> 00:12:50.508
He's only six years old.

271
00:12:51.335 --> 00:12:53.424
So. he just...

272
00:12:53.468 --> 00:12:55.296
I'm a bad mother.EVELYN: Angie.

273
00:12:55.339 --> 00:12:56.950

00:12:56.993 --> 00:12:59.735
Angie. you're not
a bad mother.

275
00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:01.606
You're in
the right place.

276
00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:04.131
You're very.

as you need.

279
00:13:09.353 --> 00:13:10.746
All right. well...

280
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.313
Hey. Mom.
you know what I think

281
00:13:12.356 --> 00:13:13.618
you could use right now?

282
00:13:13.662 --> 00:13:14.706
What?

283
00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:15.838
A new tissue.

284
00:13:18.754 --> 00:13:20.843
That's... That's... Yeah.

285
00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:24.934

Just some white paint

a street parking spot?

317
00:14:57.287 --> 00:14:59.115
I suppose so.

318
00:14:59.159 --> 00:15:01.074

of other stuff.

319
00:15:01.117 --> 00:15:02.989

322
00:15:06.601 --> 00:15:07.819

and then afterwards
we could...

324
00:15:09.082 --> 00:15:11.301

00:17:41.147 --> 00:17:43.236
the way you were
talking the other
day at lunch.

354
00:17:43.279 --> 00:17:45.890
Like. about all
the political stuff.

355
00:17:45.934 --> 00:17:48.719
I just thought you
were super honest
and passionate.

356
00:17:48.763 --> 00:17:50.069
And. like. I write music.

357
00:17:50.112 --> 00:17:51.766
Yeah. you were saying.Yeah.
and in my music.

358
00:17:51.809 --> 00:17:55.204
I'm all about
being passionate
and honest too. And...

359
00:17:55.248 --> 00:17:56.423
I have 20.000 followers.

360
00:17:56.466 --> 00:17:57.554
and I think what
they like about me

361
00:17:57.598 --> 00:17:58.729
is my passion
and charisma.

362
00:17:58.773 --> 00:18:00.296
And I thought
you had that too.

363
00:18:00.862 --> 00:18:02.646
Thanks.

364
00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:04.996
Uh. I don't really think
about it in those terms.

365
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.086
like. as a commodity.

366
00:18:07.129 --> 00:18:08.739
Oh. lift.

367
00:18:11.481 --> 00:18:13.004
Have you ever thought
about what you could do

368
00:18:13.048 --> 00:18:14.310
with a platform
like that.

369
00:18:14.354 --> 00:18:16.704
or are you just happy
taking people's money?

370
00:18:16.747 --> 00:18:19.315
Um. I guess
the first thing.

371
00:18:19.359 --> 00:18:21.665
Because it sounds
like you have a really
good opportunity

372
00:18:21.709 --> 00:18:23.493
to start a
grassroots movement

373
00:18:23.537 --> 00:18:24.712
about
environmental issues

374
00:18:24.755 --> 00:18:27.454
that concern you
or political corruption.

375
00:18:27.497 --> 00:18:30.065
especially if you're
streaming in countries
that are in need

376
00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:31.675
of organizing
from non-political
actors.

377
00:18:31.719 --> 00:18:33.199
Yeah.
I don't know. man.

378
00:18:33.242 --> 00:18:36.332
I think I'm more
of a vacation.

379
00:18:36.376 --> 00:18:39.205
Like. they deal
with all that shit
all day.

380
00:18:39.248 --> 00:18:41.511
Like the corruption.
and the poverty
or whatever.

381
00:18:41.555 --> 00:18:43.034
Like.
they're just. like.

382
00:18:43.078 --> 00:18:45.167
wandering
the dirty streets
of their towns.

383
00:18:45.211 --> 00:18:47.082
and then
they come home.

384
00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:48.736
and they see my page
and it's. like...

385
00:18:51.042 --> 00:18:52.261
Right.

386
00:18:52.305 --> 00:18:53.741
Like. sometimes I feel
like the world would be

387
00:18:53.784 --> 00:18:54.829
a better place

388
00:18:54.872 --> 00:18:56.135
if people
just chilled out

389
00:18:56.178 --> 00:18:57.658
and listened
to music. you know?

390
00:18:59.529 --> 00:19:00.704
Hmm.

391
00:19:03.359 --> 00:19:05.144
But. I mean.

392
00:19:05.187 --> 00:19:06.971
I guess
I could think about it.

393
00:19:07.015 --> 00:19:08.973
It could be kind of lift
to change it up sometime.

394
00:19:09.017 --> 00:19:10.410
Yeah. it could be.

395
00:19:10.453 --> 00:19:13.064
Because. like you said.
I got a huge platform. 20.000.

396
00:19:13.108 --> 00:19:14.153
So...

397
00:19:14.196 --> 00:19:15.589
Hear ye! Hear ye!

398
00:19:15.632 --> 00:19:17.199
We will not stand by.

399
00:19:17.243 --> 00:19:20.420
We will stand up
through revolutionary art.

400
00:19:21.551 --> 00:19:24.293
Let the performances commence.

401
00:19:24.337 --> 00:19:25.990
Are you gonna
do anything?

402
00:19:26.469 --> 00:19:27.818
I have a poem.

403
00:19:27.862 --> 00:19:28.993
Oh. lift.
I have a song.

404
00:19:29.037 --> 00:19:30.386
It's starting.
it's starting.

405
00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:32.693
Yo. yo. yo. what's up?
What's up?

406
00:19:32.736 --> 00:19:35.913
This piece is
about the patriarchy.

407
00:19:35.957 --> 00:19:38.612
of which
I'm a reluctant member.

408
00:19:56.586 --> 00:19:58.980
Sonia. hello.How you doing?

409
00:20:21.698 --> 00:20:22.786
Hello.KYLE: Oh.

410
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:24.135
Hey. Evelyn.
how you doing?

411
00:20:24.179 --> 00:20:25.398
Very well.
thank you.

412
00:20:25.441 --> 00:20:27.356
How about you?
Do you like it here?

413
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.792
Do you have
any complaints?

414
00:20:28.836 --> 00:20:30.141
Oh. no. not really.

415
00:20:30.185 --> 00:20:31.360
I mean. it's great.

416
00:20:31.404 --> 00:20:33.754
My mom's happy here.
that's the main thing.

417
00:20:33.797 --> 00:20:36.496
Hmm. What are you
working on over there?

418
00:20:36.539 --> 00:20:37.975
It's algebra.

419
00:20:38.019 --> 00:20:39.412
Oh. I would offer
to help you.

420
00:20:39.455 --> 00:20:40.804
but I don't remember
how to do it.

421
00:20:40.848 --> 00:20:43.285
It's cool. I... It comes
kind of easy to me.

422
00:20:43.329 --> 00:20:45.026
Well. you're
naturally very bright.

423
00:20:46.506 --> 00:20:47.724
Where do you
go to school?

424
00:20:47.768 --> 00:20:49.726
Hamilton.Oh. my son
goes there.

425
00:20:51.467 --> 00:20:53.600
It's a big school.Yes. it's too big.

426
00:20:53.643 --> 00:20:54.731
I think.

427
00:20:55.863 --> 00:20:58.300
So. I need your help
with something.

428
00:20:58.344 --> 00:20:59.910
What?I need
someone tall.

429
00:21:01.434 --> 00:21:04.175
I used to rake in like 200
to 250 bucks in a weekend.

430
00:21:04.219 --> 00:21:06.352
Oh. that's quite
a lot of money.You think?

431
00:21:06.395 --> 00:21:08.179
I do. I...
I do think...

432
00:21:08.223 --> 00:21:10.051
But the restraining order kind
of killed the whole thing.

433
00:21:10.094 --> 00:21:11.400
I mean.

434
00:21:11.444 --> 00:21:13.359
any guy that hits his
wife is terrible my book.

435
00:21:13.402 --> 00:21:15.143
but I could take it.
you know?

436
00:21:15.186 --> 00:21:17.711
Now. I literally got
no income.

437
00:21:17.754 --> 00:21:19.321
Well. would you ever want
to work anywhere

438
00:21:19.365 --> 00:21:21.758
besides
the autobody shop?

439
00:21:21.802 --> 00:21:23.020
I don't know.
my dad owned the place.

440
00:21:23.064 --> 00:21:24.195
so it was kind of perfect.

441
00:21:24.239 --> 00:21:26.197
It'd be like your son
working here.

442
00:21:26.241 --> 00:21:27.373
You said you
had a son. right?

443
00:21:27.416 --> 00:21:29.462
Yes.Yeah. so it'd be
a sweet job.

444
00:21:29.505 --> 00:21:30.637
I mean. if your mom
owned the place.

445
00:21:32.116 --> 00:21:34.597
Oh. um. can you pass me
a screwdriver?

446
00:21:34.641 --> 00:21:36.338
The. um. yellow one?Oh.

447
00:21:36.382 --> 00:21:37.557
The flat head.Oh!

448
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.036
The yellow one?KYLE: Yes.

449
00:21:41.125 --> 00:21:42.736
Thank you.EVELYN: Here you go.

450
00:21:42.779 --> 00:21:44.651
And I was
seriously good at it. too.

451
00:21:44.694 --> 00:21:45.869
I mean. my dad
used to say

452
00:21:45.913 --> 00:21:47.001
that. uh. kids make
the best mechanics.

453
00:21:47.044 --> 00:21:49.090
because they got
tiny little fingers.

454
00:21:49.133 --> 00:21:50.831
Actually. it sounds
kind of creepy
when I say that.

455
00:21:50.874 --> 00:21:52.572
It does sound
a little creepy. yes.

456
00:21:55.618 --> 00:21:56.750
You're not going
to become him.

457
00:21:56.793 --> 00:21:57.838
What?

458
00:21:57.881 --> 00:21:59.230
You're not going
to become him. Kyle.

459
00:21:59.274 --> 00:22:00.754
if that's what you're
worried about.

460
00:22:00.797 --> 00:22:02.277
What? No... Why would I...
I'm not worried about that.

461
00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:04.279
Oh. right.
Of course not.

462
00:22:04.323 --> 00:22:05.759
Why would I become him?
He's a dick.

463
00:22:05.802 --> 00:22:08.109
Yes. Yes. No...
My mistake.

464
00:22:08.152 --> 00:22:09.893
I'm like a normal dude.

465
00:22:09.937 --> 00:22:11.634
Yes. you are.

466
00:22:11.678 --> 00:22:12.853
You are. You're...

467
00:22:13.593 --> 00:22:15.029
You're better than normal.

468
00:22:15.595 --> 00:22:17.510
I was. um...

469
00:22:17.553 --> 00:22:20.077
I was very taken with the way
you behaved with Angie.

470
00:22:20.121 --> 00:22:21.905
with your mother
the other night.

471
00:22:21.949 --> 00:22:23.211
What do you mean?

472
00:22:23.254 --> 00:22:24.604
Well. you were
very gentle
with your mother

473
00:22:24.647 --> 00:22:26.257
at a very
vulnerable time.

474
00:22:26.301 --> 00:22:31.785
Um. if I can
speak freely.
I was moved.

475
00:22:31.828 --> 00:22:33.439
Yeah. well. my mom's
gotten the shit

476
00:22:33.482 --> 00:22:35.223
kicked out of her
since she was born.

477
00:22:35.266 --> 00:22:37.312
I know. Do you?

478
00:22:37.356 --> 00:22:38.705
Well. I...
I can imagine.

479
00:22:42.448 --> 00:22:44.145
Kyle. would you be

480
00:22:44.188 --> 00:22:46.843
open to discussing options
for your future

481
00:22:46.887 --> 00:22:48.497
other than the body shop?

482
00:22:48.541 --> 00:22:50.107
Like what?

483
00:22:50.151 --> 00:22:52.675
Well. are there any other jobs
you might be interested in?

484
00:22:53.676 --> 00:22:55.112
Uh. when I was a kid.

485
00:22:55.156 --> 00:22:56.418
I always wanted
to play for the Pacers.

486
00:22:56.462 --> 00:22:57.811
The Pacers?

487
00:22:57.854 --> 00:23:00.335
Yeah. the
basketball team.Oh. right. yes!

488
00:23:00.379 --> 00:23:02.424
Well. um. is there
anything else?

489
00:23:02.468 --> 00:23:04.948
Anything a little
more practical?

490
00:23:04.992 --> 00:23:06.472
The body shop's
practical.

491
00:23:06.515 --> 00:23:08.996
Yes. of course.
Yes. Yes. it is.

492
00:23:11.172 --> 00:23:12.869
You know...

493
00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.437
I was just like you.

494
00:23:15.481 --> 00:23:16.612
When I was your age.

495
00:23:16.656 --> 00:23:18.397
I was determined
to become the editor

496
00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.399
of Rolling StoneMagazine.

497
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:25.447
And then when
I went to college. I...

498
00:23:25.491 --> 00:23:26.840
I met someone
who introduced me

499
00:23:26.883 --> 00:23:28.058
to a life
of social service.

500
00:23:28.102 --> 00:23:29.277
And I'm.
I'm embarrassed

501
00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.670
that I ever considered
anything else.

502
00:23:30.713 --> 00:23:32.062
Yeah. I mean. yeah.

503
00:23:32.106 --> 00:23:33.716
But people still need
to have their cars fixed.

504
00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.022
Oh. of course they do.

505
00:23:35.065 --> 00:23:36.458
So it's not like
a totally stupid job.

506
00:23:36.502 --> 00:23:38.373
Oh. yes. Yes. no. it's...
It's a very good job.

507
00:23:38.417 --> 00:23:40.462
It's...
It's a very
important job.

508
00:23:40.506 --> 00:23:43.247
But you have
an unusual heart. Kyle.

509
00:23:43.291 --> 00:23:44.771
I mean. most...
Most boys your age

510
00:23:44.814 --> 00:23:46.860
can't bring
themselves to be kind.

511
00:23:46.903 --> 00:23:49.123
and you can't
help yourself.

512
00:23:49.166 --> 00:23:50.429
You really think so?

513
00:23:51.473 --> 00:23:52.735
You're a special person.

514
00:23:56.217 --> 00:23:57.348
I'm sorry.

515
00:23:57.392 --> 00:23:58.437
No. it's cool.

516
00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:05.487
You know.
my friend Margaret runs

517
00:24:05.531 --> 00:24:07.881
the social work
program at Oberlin.

518
00:24:07.924 --> 00:24:09.056
Where's Oberlin?

519
00:24:09.099 --> 00:24:10.361
Well. it's. uh.
just next door
in Ohio.

520
00:24:10.405 --> 00:24:12.276
It's actually
a very beautiful town.

521
00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.844
and you'd be surrounded
by. by people like you.

522
00:24:14.888 --> 00:24:18.413
Bright. curious.
good. young people.

523
00:24:18.457 --> 00:24:19.632
How much is it?

524
00:24:19.675 --> 00:24:21.764
Well. there are all
sorts of scholarships

525
00:24:21.808 --> 00:24:24.767
for people like...
For people
in your situation.

526
00:24:24.811 --> 00:24:27.030
and Margaret
owes me a favor.

527
00:24:27.074 --> 00:24:28.728
Let me make
a few calls.

528
00:24:28.771 --> 00:24:30.686
Seriously?Absolutely.

529
00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:32.166
Yo. thank you
so much. Evelyn.

530
00:24:32.209 --> 00:24:34.734
It is unquestionably
my pleasure.

531
00:24:36.649 --> 00:24:38.694
Ohio.

532
00:24:38.738 --> 00:24:42.829
And we both
never tell a lie.

533
00:24:43.438 --> 00:24:45.048
Or do we?

534
00:24:48.312 --> 00:24:50.924
That was very powerful.
Thank you so much.

535
00:24:50.967 --> 00:24:54.057
Um. up next
we have Lila Stryjewski

536
00:24:54.101 --> 00:24:55.406
with an original poem.

537
00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:57.670
Yo. good luck. Lila.

538
00:24:58.497 --> 00:24:59.628
Not that you need it.

539
00:25:05.939 --> 00:25:07.375
Hi. everybody.

540
00:25:07.767 --> 00:25:09.508
Um...

541
00:25:09.551 --> 00:25:11.684
This is something I wrote
about the Marshall Islands.

542
00:25:11.727 --> 00:25:13.163
They're in the Pacific Ocean.

543
00:25:13.207 --> 00:25:14.948
and they've been
exploited for centuries.

544
00:25:14.991 --> 00:25:17.211
and now they're literally
sinking due to the effects

545
00:25:17.254 --> 00:25:18.995
of global warming.

546
00:25:19.039 --> 00:25:20.954
Um...

547
00:25:20.997 --> 00:25:23.260
I don't know
if it's any good or...

548
00:25:23.304 --> 00:25:25.567

that doesn't really matter.

about you?

To what?Literally anything else.

681
00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:45.414

to this music

on the way to work.

683
00:33:46.546 --> 00:33:48.026
It's elitist.No. it's not.

684
00:33:48.069 --> 00:33:50.115
Of course it is. It's just
a bunch of rich. white men.

685
00:33:50.158 --> 00:33:51.899
I don't care about that stuff.
but you pretend to.

686
00:33:51.942 --> 00:33:53.074
so I just thought
you should know

687
00:33:53.118 --> 00:33:54.684
it's kind of hypocritical.

688
00:33:54.728 --> 00:33:56.904
Okay. thank you
for the advice.

689
00:33:56.947 --> 00:33:57.992
Sure.

690
00:34:08.437 --> 00:34:10.744

interesting in school today?

No.Reading any books?

00:34:13.312 --> 00:34:14.748
Yeah. we're doing. um.

693
00:34:14.791 --> 00:34:16.793
To Kill A Mockingbird
in lit class.

694
00:34:16.837 --> 00:34:18.926
It's always Harper Lee
and never Toni Morrison.

695
00:34:18.969 --> 00:34:20.406
What?No. nothing.

696
00:34:20.449 --> 00:34:21.711
I would just... I would just
suggest you push yourself

697
00:34:21.755 --> 00:34:23.061
beyond the curriculum there.

698
00:34:29.893 --> 00:34:31.156
Mom.Yes?

699
00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:34.594
Do you think
I could be political?

700
00:34:34.637 --> 00:34:35.986
I'm sorry. what?

701
00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:38.119
Like. there are these kids
at school.

702
00:34:38.163 --> 00:34:39.555
and. like. they're super
political and stuff.

703
00:34:39.599 --> 00:34:41.122
and I was just wondering
if maybe

704
00:34:41.166 --> 00:34:42.602
you thought
that I could be too.

705
00:34:42.645 --> 00:34:43.777
Mmm-hmm.

706
00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:46.562
What do they talk about.
these other kids?

707
00:34:46.606 --> 00:34:49.652
Just. like. everything.
like wars

708
00:34:49.696 --> 00:34:52.829
and politicians.
and the environment.

709
00:34:52.873 --> 00:34:54.222
What do they say
about all that?

710
00:34:54.266 --> 00:34:56.137
Well. they're against
most of it.

711
00:34:56.181 --> 00:34:58.357
I mean. not the environment.
they're for that.

712
00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.359
Oh. that's a relief.

713
00:35:00.402 --> 00:35:03.449
So. um.
what are you asking me?

714
00:35:03.492 --> 00:35:05.407
Well. you're interested
in that stuff too.

715
00:35:05.451 --> 00:35:07.714
so I was just wondering
if. like.

716
00:35:07.757 --> 00:35:09.455
you had anything
for me to say to them.

717
00:35:09.498 --> 00:35:10.717
To get them to like you?

718
00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.414
What? No. I...

719
00:35:12.458 --> 00:35:14.547
I want to be smart
and interested too.

720
00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:17.376
Well. it sounds to me
like you want a shortcut

721
00:35:17.419 --> 00:35:19.117
to sound intelligent. to get
some kids to like you.

722
00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.205
I don't want a shortcut.

723
00:35:20.248 --> 00:35:21.641
No? Well. no.
what is it then?

724
00:35:21.684 --> 00:35:23.077
Because. I mean. if you want
to talk to these kids.

725
00:35:23.121 --> 00:35:24.078
then you should just listen
to what they're saying

726
00:35:24.122 --> 00:35:25.166
and form your own opinion.

727
00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:26.515
I'm not gonna spoon-feed you

728
00:35:26.559 --> 00:35:28.300
some cool line
about the Middle East

729
00:35:28.343 --> 00:35:29.823
because you won't
learn that way.

730
00:35:29.866 --> 00:35:30.954
Half the time
they're talking.

731
00:35:30.998 --> 00:35:32.130
I don't even know
what they're saying.

732
00:35:32.173 --> 00:35:33.174
Because you haven't
done the work.

733
00:35:33.218 --> 00:35:34.523
What work?Well...

734
00:35:34.567 --> 00:35:36.090
Well. you can't just jump
right int the middle

735
00:35:36.134 --> 00:35:36.786
of a debate about something
which you know nothing about.

736
00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:37.874
Yeah. okay.

737
00:35:37.918 --> 00:35:39.311
Look. if you don't
make the effort

738
00:35:39.354 --> 00:35:40.616
to understand the issues
that are affecting society.

739
00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:42.705
then your problems
extend far beyond

740
00:35:42.749 --> 00:35:44.054
impressing your classmates.

741
00:35:44.098 --> 00:35:46.056
and there's no shortcut
that I can give you...

742
00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:47.971
Mom stop saying
fucking "shortcut"!

743
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:04.205
You know.
when you were
a little boy.

744
00:36:04.249 --> 00:36:08.035
I brought you to every march.
every protest.

745
00:36:08.078 --> 00:36:10.385
You were my little ally.

746
00:36:10.429 --> 00:36:12.561
You'd play
all our protest songs

747
00:36:12.605 --> 00:36:15.825
on that plastic rainbow guitar
that we got you.

748
00:36:15.869 --> 00:36:17.349
Where Have All
The Flowers Gone.

749
00:36:17.392 --> 00:36:18.437
The Fiddle and The Drum.

750
00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.308
There Once Was A Union Maid.

751
00:36:20.352 --> 00:36:21.396
You remember that?

752
00:36:24.878 --> 00:36:26.662
Your life was gonna be happier

753
00:36:26.706 --> 00:36:28.534
because you were
part of the struggle.

754
00:36:32.146 --> 00:36:34.192
You were gonna be
one of the good ones.

755
00:36:36.803 --> 00:36:39.153
And then something
switched in you.

756
00:36:39.197 --> 00:36:41.199
You stopped being
interested in anything

757
00:36:41.242 --> 00:36:43.549
outside your own little world.
and I...

758
00:36:44.332 --> 00:36:45.464
I would take you with me.

759
00:36:45.507 --> 00:36:47.379
but you would
always want to go home.

760
00:36:48.858 --> 00:36:50.295
Sorry about that.

761
00:36:50.338 --> 00:36:53.820
Now. I know that you want
to impress these kids.

762
00:36:53.863 --> 00:36:55.082
But it's not going
to impress them.

763
00:36:55.125 --> 00:36:56.779
if it doesn't come
from a sincere place.

764
00:36:56.823 --> 00:36:59.173
So. do the work. Read.

765
00:36:59.217 --> 00:37:01.131
Educate yourself
and then I'll help you.

766
00:37:01.175 --> 00:37:02.263
And then we can talk about

767
00:37:02.307 --> 00:37:03.917
some things for you
to say. okay?

768
00:37:05.179 --> 00:37:06.311
Yeah.

769
00:37:09.227 --> 00:37:11.098
Does that sound like a plan?

770
00:37:11.141 --> 00:37:13.013
Yeah. it does.

771
00:37:13.056 --> 00:37:14.928
Thanks for the advice.Of course.

772
00:37:17.147 --> 00:37:18.410
Have a good day. son.

773
00:37:31.466 --> 00:37:32.815
Jesus. Ziggy!

774
00:38:30.133 --> 00:38:32.135
I'm gonna go get
some baking soda.

775
00:38:38.751 --> 00:38:40.100
Yo. Lila. what's up?

776
00:38:40.143 --> 00:38:41.275
Hey. Ziggy.

777
00:38:41.319 --> 00:38:43.103
Just getting some
baking soda or whatever.

778
00:38:43.495 --> 00:38:45.410
Cool. man.

779
00:38:45.453 --> 00:38:46.802
Hey. I just wanted
to say that I was. like.

780
00:38:46.846 --> 00:38:48.413
rereading your poem
from the party.

781
00:38:48.456 --> 00:38:49.979
I just think it was so lift.

782
00:38:50.023 --> 00:38:52.634
Like. I love the phrasing
and the build and everything.

783
00:38:52.678 --> 00:38:54.462
It's actually
tera sophisticated.

784
00:38:54.506 --> 00:38:56.290
Thanks for the validation.

785
00:38:56.334 --> 00:38:57.813
But you should probably
put your goggles back on

786
00:38:57.857 --> 00:38:59.032
before Mr. Ryan sees.

787
00:38:59.075 --> 00:39:00.686
What's he gonna do?
Arrest me?

788
00:39:00.729 --> 00:39:02.035
You're a rebel.Yup.

789
00:39:05.517 --> 00:39:06.909
Just got the baking soda.

790
00:39:09.347 --> 00:39:10.652
Actually. I'm just gonna
go get some more.

791
00:39:10.696 --> 00:39:12.001
You're not gonna
help me?

792
00:39:12.045 --> 00:39:13.568
Jackie. fuck off.
I'm doing something important.

793
00:39:22.577 --> 00:39:23.752
Hey. and I also
just wanted to say...

794
00:39:23.796 --> 00:39:25.711
Jesus. stop fucking
sneaking up on me.

795
00:39:25.754 --> 00:39:27.756
Oh. sorry.

796
00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:29.149
Uh. I also just wanted to say.

797
00:39:29.192 --> 00:39:30.803
I know you talk about politics
all the time

798
00:39:30.846 --> 00:39:33.501
and I probably don't look like
I know what I'm talking about.

799
00:39:33.545 --> 00:39:37.026
but I actually know a lot
about all that stuff.

800
00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:38.593
Like. you probably
wouldn't know

801
00:39:38.637 --> 00:39:40.290
because I focus
so hard on my music.

802
00:39:40.334 --> 00:39:41.857
but when I was a kid.

803
00:39:41.901 --> 00:39:43.337
I went to every protest.
and every sit-in

804
00:39:43.381 --> 00:39:44.991
and I was a real ally.

805
00:39:45.034 --> 00:39:46.819
I even played
these protest songs

806
00:39:46.862 --> 00:39:48.429
on this little plastic guitar.

807
00:39:48.473 --> 00:39:49.909
Like There once Was
A Union Maid...

808
00:39:49.952 --> 00:39:51.824
MR. RYAN: Ziggy. goggles.Yup. shit. sorry.

809
00:39:51.867 --> 00:39:54.217
MR. RYAN: Don't say "shit."Yup.

810
00:39:54.261 --> 00:39:57.656
So. that's just.
like. what I wanted to say.

811
00:39:58.744 --> 00:40:00.223
Thank you for saying it.

812
00:40:00.267 --> 00:40:01.399
You're welcome.

813
00:40:01.921 --> 00:40:03.662
Ziggy.Yeah?

814
00:40:03.705 --> 00:40:05.533
You don't have
to be interested in politics.

815
00:40:06.795 --> 00:40:08.014
But I am.

816
00:40:08.057 --> 00:40:10.756
No. you're not.
It's obvious. but it's cool.

817
00:40:11.713 --> 00:40:13.367
You think I'm stupid?

818
00:40:13.411 --> 00:40:15.717
No. no. I didn't say that.

819
00:40:15.761 --> 00:40:17.806
So. can you teach me?

820
00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:19.634
About what?

821
00:40:19.678 --> 00:40:21.419
I watch you talk about things.

822
00:40:22.202 --> 00:40:25.597
Like... Like. big things.

823
00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:28.121
And you talk about them
with such passion.

824
00:40:28.164 --> 00:40:29.296
like the way most people talk

825
00:40:29.339 --> 00:40:31.254
about shit
they just want to buy.

826
00:40:31.298 --> 00:40:32.908
you talk about the world.

827
00:40:34.214 --> 00:40:35.476
I want to be like that.

828
00:40:36.869 --> 00:40:38.087
I want to be like you.

829
00:41:14.123 --> 00:41:15.603
Hello. Marci.

830
00:41:15.647 --> 00:41:17.692
Hi. Hi. Evelyn.

831
00:41:17.736 --> 00:41:19.520
Are you having a good day?

832
00:41:19.564 --> 00:41:22.436
Mmm-hmm. Yeah. it's good.
So far so good.

833
00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.264
Is your work going well?

834
00:41:24.307 --> 00:41:25.439
Yeah. it's great.

835
00:41:25.483 --> 00:41:27.267
Do you enjoy it?
Do you enjoy the work?

836
00:41:27.963 --> 00:41:29.051
Yeah. of course.

837
00:41:29.095 --> 00:41:30.879
it's very rewarding.

838
00:41:30.923 --> 00:41:33.360
Will you tell me again how
long you've been working here?

839
00:41:33.403 --> 00:41:36.972
Um. it'll be two years
next month.

840
00:41:38.583 --> 00:41:39.888
Are you firing me?

841
00:41:39.932 --> 00:41:43.152
No. Oh. no. no. dear.
You're a wonderful employee.

842
00:41:43.196 --> 00:41:45.415
No. I'm just talking.

843
00:41:45.459 --> 00:41:47.940
The elevator takes so long
to come here.

844
00:41:54.599 --> 00:41:56.731
That was a nice conversation.

845
00:42:29.764 --> 00:42:31.287
Oh. hi.

846
00:42:31.331 --> 00:42:34.073
Hello. I just. um. wanted
to see if you were all right.

847
00:42:34.116 --> 00:42:36.423
if you needed anything
from me or from any of us.

848
00:42:36.466 --> 00:42:38.294
No. it's been great.

849
00:42:38.338 --> 00:42:40.166
everyone is so helpful. and...

850
00:42:40.819 --> 00:42:41.907
Good. good.

851
00:42:42.995 --> 00:42:45.998
Yeah. Uh. do you
want to come in?

852
00:42:46.041 --> 00:42:47.608
Oh! Sure. why not?

853
00:42:49.131 --> 00:42:50.263
Is Kyle here?

854
00:42:50.306 --> 00:42:52.308
Oh. he's just in
the bathroom.

855
00:42:52.352 --> 00:42:55.224
Uh. honey. Evelyn is here.KYLE: Hey.

856
00:42:55.268 --> 00:42:56.530
Oh. jeez.

857
00:42:56.574 --> 00:42:57.836
How's it going?

858
00:42:57.879 --> 00:43:00.229
Oh. very well. I was just
checking up on you.

859
00:43:00.273 --> 00:43:02.057
making sure everything was
to your liking.

860
00:43:02.101 --> 00:43:04.233
And I said it was and...

861
00:43:05.234 --> 00:43:07.367
Is your shirt okay?

862
00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:12.328
Oh. uh. yes. it is. I don't
know why I put this here.

863
00:43:12.372 --> 00:43:15.331
Um. I brought you
this hat. Kyle.

864
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:17.769
Indiana Acers.

865
00:43:17.812 --> 00:43:19.074
Yes. I noticed that.

866
00:43:19.118 --> 00:43:20.685
I think the P fell off
in the dryer.

867
00:43:20.728 --> 00:43:22.861
It was my son's.
but he no longer wears it.

868
00:43:22.904 --> 00:43:24.123
He wears...

869
00:43:24.166 --> 00:43:25.951
Well. actually. I don't...
I don't know...

870
00:43:25.994 --> 00:43:27.605
I don't know
what he wears anymore.

871
00:43:27.648 --> 00:43:31.521
Anyway. um. that is for you.

872
00:43:31.565 --> 00:43:32.653
Thank you so much. Evelyn.

873
00:43:32.697 --> 00:43:33.959
I remember you said
you liked them.

874
00:43:34.002 --> 00:43:35.221
He loves them!

875
00:43:35.264 --> 00:43:37.484
Evelyn! Kyle. say thank you.

876
00:43:37.527 --> 00:43:38.920
I just did. Mom.

877
00:43:38.964 --> 00:43:40.356
Well. it was the least
I could do.

878
00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.358
Kyle was very helpful
with some minor repairs

879
00:43:42.402 --> 00:43:43.882
around the shelter.

880
00:43:43.925 --> 00:43:46.014
Oh. I heard. He said it was
the highlight of his week.

881
00:43:46.058 --> 00:43:47.537
Well. I like staying busy.

882
00:43:48.669 --> 00:43:51.890
Oh. um. well. in that case.

883
00:43:51.933 --> 00:43:54.109
how would you like to
run an errand with me?

884
00:43:54.849 --> 00:43:56.155
Mom?

885
00:43:56.198 --> 00:43:57.678
You don't mind
if I borrow him.
do you. Angie?

886
00:43:58.244 --> 00:43:59.462
Sure.

887
00:44:06.339 --> 00:44:07.688
Feel free to change
the station

888
00:44:07.732 --> 00:44:09.777
if there's something else
you'd like.

889
00:44:12.345 --> 00:44:13.912
No. this is cool.

890
00:44:13.955 --> 00:44:15.261
It's not too stuffy?

891
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:24.487
Okay.
now that's everything.

892
00:44:24.531 --> 00:44:25.967
All right.

893
00:44:26.011 --> 00:44:28.361
Kyle. just. um. just put these
in wherever it'll fit.

894
00:44:28.404 --> 00:44:30.145
Don't be precious about it.KYLE: Gotcha.

895
00:44:30.189 --> 00:44:31.625
Not too heavy?

896
00:44:31.669 --> 00:44:32.974
Of course not.

897
00:44:33.018 --> 00:44:34.454
Is that your son?

898
00:44:34.497 --> 00:44:36.064
No. no. no.
he's just a...

899
00:44:36.108 --> 00:44:38.240
He's just a kid
who works at the shelter.

900
00:44:39.764 --> 00:44:41.330
So. you'll appreciate this.
Kyle.

901
00:44:41.374 --> 00:44:43.202
Marcella does
all the translations

902
00:44:43.245 --> 00:44:45.160
for Spanish speakers
at the shelter.

903
00:44:45.204 --> 00:44:46.553
The women are
in and out of court

904
00:44:46.596 --> 00:44:47.902
all the time with custody

905
00:44:47.946 --> 00:44:49.817
and orders of protection.
and you cannot imagine

906
00:44:49.861 --> 00:44:51.166
how rigged the system is

907
00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:52.341
against non-native
English speakers.

908
00:44:52.385 --> 00:44:54.648
But Marcella is a genius.Please.

909
00:44:54.692 --> 00:44:55.736
And that is not
an exaggeration.

910
00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:56.781
I'm not a genius.

911
00:44:56.824 --> 00:44:58.304
No. no. no.

912
00:44:58.347 --> 00:45:00.741
You're more effective than
any lawyer we've ever hired.

913
00:45:00.785 --> 00:45:02.961
Look. you can
tell him the truth.

914
00:45:03.004 --> 00:45:05.267
I used to be a resident
at the shelter.

915
00:45:05.311 --> 00:45:06.704
Oh. really?

916
00:45:06.747 --> 00:45:10.925
My husband... My ex-husband
and I was undocumented.

917
00:45:10.969 --> 00:45:12.144
I couldn't go to the police.

918
00:45:12.187 --> 00:45:13.754
and I couldn't go back
to Honduras.

919
00:45:13.798 --> 00:45:16.061
Shit. I'm sorry
that happened to you.

920
00:45:16.104 --> 00:45:17.149
Thank you.

921
00:45:17.192 --> 00:45:18.933
My mom and I
are living there now.

922
00:45:18.977 --> 00:45:20.674
Yeah. my dad's kind of a...

923
00:45:21.196 --> 00:45:22.328
I know.

924
00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:25.635
What was that?

925
00:45:25.679 --> 00:45:26.811
Oh. sorry. I was just saying

926
00:45:26.854 --> 00:45:28.464
that my dad's
not really a great guy.

927
00:45:28.508 --> 00:45:29.770
Uh. you speak Spanish?

928
00:45:29.814 --> 00:45:32.555
I mean. high school Spanish.

929
00:45:46.482 --> 00:45:48.963
My goodness. you are
full of hidden talents!

930
00:45:49.007 --> 00:45:50.791
Oh. I guess
I just got a good ear.

931
00:45:56.318 --> 00:45:58.016
Uh. okay. Kyle. I think that
we should be heading back.

932
00:45:58.059 --> 00:45:59.713
I don't want your mother
to worry.

933
00:45:59.757 --> 00:46:00.801
Oh. I don't think
that she'll worry...

934
00:46:00.845 --> 00:46:02.498
No. no. We really should go.

935
00:46:02.542 --> 00:46:04.413
Uh. Marcella. thank you.
Thank you so much for this.

936
00:46:04.457 --> 00:46:05.501
It was great to see you.

937
00:46:05.545 --> 00:46:06.851
and I will just. um.

938
00:46:06.894 --> 00:46:08.983
I will just bring my mug
into the kitchen.

939
00:46:09.027 --> 00:46:11.420
No. leave it.No. no. I've got it.

940
00:46:11.464 --> 00:46:13.814
I'm gonna pop it
into the dishwasher.

941
00:46:13.858 --> 00:46:16.121
Oh. are these clean or dirty?

942
00:46:18.558 --> 00:46:19.907
Marcella seems pretty cool.

943
00:46:19.951 --> 00:46:21.996
She's fine. Do you want to
get something to eat?

944
00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:24.259
Oh. I'm cool just to
go back if you want.

945
00:46:24.303 --> 00:46:27.219
No. let's... Let's get you
something to eat.

946
00:46:27.262 --> 00:46:28.611
I owe you.

947
00:47:05.387 --> 00:47:06.736
Hello?

948
00:47:07.781 --> 00:47:08.826
Hello?

949
00:47:10.392 --> 00:47:11.480
Mom?

950
00:47:16.485 --> 00:47:17.660
I don't suppose

951
00:47:17.704 --> 00:47:20.011
you've had Ethiopian food
before. have you?

952
00:47:20.054 --> 00:47:21.534
Uh. no. definitely not.

953
00:47:21.577 --> 00:47:22.840
You have to
eat with your hands.

954
00:47:22.883 --> 00:47:24.885
I hope that's all right.Do they give you gloves?

955
00:47:24.929 --> 00:47:26.408
That's cute.

956
00:47:26.452 --> 00:47:27.888
I... I think you'll enjoy it.

957
00:47:27.932 --> 00:47:29.411
My son used
to love coming here.

958
00:47:29.455 --> 00:47:30.499
and then
he started complaining

959
00:47:30.543 --> 00:47:31.805
that it made
his hands feel dirty.

960
00:47:31.849 --> 00:47:33.067
That makes sense.

961
00:47:33.111 --> 00:47:34.721
No! You know people
get their hands dirty.

962
00:47:34.764 --> 00:47:36.636
it's a fact of life.

963
00:47:36.679 --> 00:47:39.552
You understand that
because you work with cars.

964
00:47:39.595 --> 00:47:40.901
I feel like I should've
brought a fork.

965
00:47:40.945 --> 00:47:42.555
Oh. no. stop it.

966
00:47:42.598 --> 00:47:43.948
You're gonna be just fine.

967
00:47:44.383 --> 00:47:45.471
After you!

968
00:47:45.514 --> 00:47:46.951
Thank you.

969
00:48:00.573 --> 00:48:02.618
Hi.Oh. Jesus. Fuck. Dad!

970
00:48:02.662 --> 00:48:03.924
When did you get home?

971
00:48:03.968 --> 00:48:05.970
Just now! Where's Mom?

972
00:48:06.013 --> 00:48:07.362
Working late. I guess.

973
00:48:08.059 --> 00:48:09.451
Okay.

974
00:48:09.495 --> 00:48:11.410
Do you want to. like.
order a pizza or something?

975
00:48:11.453 --> 00:48:12.541
I made a duck.

976
00:48:20.941 --> 00:48:22.551
You want some wine?

977
00:48:22.595 --> 00:48:23.683
No thanks. Dad.

978
00:48:24.858 --> 00:48:27.121
Yeah. it's not
very good anyway.

979
00:48:30.124 --> 00:48:32.083
So which one is Marci again?

980
00:48:32.126 --> 00:48:34.215
When you walk in.
she's the first desk.

981
00:48:34.259 --> 00:48:35.521
You've seen her
a million times.

982
00:48:35.564 --> 00:48:37.305
With the thick glasses?Mmm-hmm. yeah.

983
00:48:37.349 --> 00:48:38.698
Exactly. Marci.

984
00:48:38.741 --> 00:48:39.917
And she used to be
a wrestler?

985
00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:41.396
Mmm-hmm. I'm serious.

986
00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:44.486
Like. "This Thursday
at Bankers Life Arena.

987
00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:47.054
"I challenge you. Undertaker.
in a fight to the death!"

988
00:48:47.098 --> 00:48:48.534
No. no. no. no.

989
00:48:48.577 --> 00:48:50.057
No. no. not like that.

990
00:48:50.101 --> 00:48:52.886
No. college wrestling. you
know with the ugly one piece

991
00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:54.105
and the soft helmet?

992
00:48:54.148 --> 00:48:55.845
Oh. I can't imagine her
doing that.

993
00:48:55.889 --> 00:48:57.760
And apparently she
was ranked very highly.

994
00:48:57.804 --> 00:48:58.848
She was at IU?

995
00:48:58.892 --> 00:49:01.112
Mmm-hmm. big 10 school.
full ride.

996
00:49:01.155 --> 00:49:02.330
For wrestling?For wrestling.

997
00:49:02.374 --> 00:49:04.158
they give out scholarships
for anything.

998
00:49:04.202 --> 00:49:06.030
That's what we have
to find for you.

999
00:49:06.073 --> 00:49:07.248
Right.

1000
00:49:07.292 --> 00:49:08.728
I'm still nudging my friend
at Oberlin.

1001
00:49:08.771 --> 00:49:10.338
but worst-case scenario.
we get you in IU

1002
00:49:10.382 --> 00:49:11.861
with a scholarship or aid.

1003
00:49:11.905 --> 00:49:12.993
They make the process
unnecessarily

1004
00:49:13.037 --> 00:49:14.299
complicated these days.

1005
00:49:14.342 --> 00:49:16.257
Yeah. I was. um. thinking
about all that.

1006
00:49:16.301 --> 00:49:17.693
like. since you mentioned it
the other day.

1007
00:49:17.737 --> 00:49:19.260
Good. Oh. me too.

1008
00:49:19.304 --> 00:49:22.350
Um. this is embarrassing.
but I actually got

1009
00:49:22.394 --> 00:49:24.787
an online subscription to
US News and World Report

1010
00:49:24.831 --> 00:49:27.355
just to check
the college rankings.

1011
00:49:27.399 --> 00:49:29.401
Oh. Evelyn. you don't have
to do all that for me.

1012
00:49:29.444 --> 00:49:32.621
Oh. no. but I want to.
I want to do it.

1013
00:49:32.665 --> 00:49:34.406
Have you thought
about a personal essay?

1014
00:49:34.449 --> 00:49:35.494
What's that?

1015
00:49:35.537 --> 00:49:36.669
Well. it shouldn't
be hard for you

1016
00:49:36.712 --> 00:49:38.236
because you've been through
so much.

1017
00:49:38.279 --> 00:49:40.151
But we'd have to codify it
in a way that feels academic.

1018
00:49:40.194 --> 00:49:41.674
Right.And it should be fun.

1019
00:49:41.717 --> 00:49:43.023
You know?
It should be fun for us.

1020
00:49:43.415 --> 00:49:44.459
Cool.

1021
00:49:44.503 --> 00:49:45.678
Cool.

1022
00:49:45.721 --> 00:49:46.809
Um...

1023
00:49:46.853 --> 00:49:48.463
So do you like the food?

1024
00:49:48.507 --> 00:49:49.943
I do. yeah.

1025
00:49:49.987 --> 00:49:51.684
I mean. it mostly just tastes
like regular vegetables.

1026
00:49:51.727 --> 00:49:53.294
but it's good.

1027
00:49:53.338 --> 00:49:56.471
Because you're kind of
avoiding the red goopy stuff.

1028
00:49:56.515 --> 00:50:00.258
Yeah. because the red goopy
stuff is insanely spicy.

1029
00:50:00.301 --> 00:50:04.784
You know. in Ethiopia.
not eating the red goopy stuff

1030
00:50:04.827 --> 00:50:06.307
is extremely disrespectful.

1031
00:50:07.091 --> 00:50:08.353
Shit. really?

1032
00:50:08.396 --> 00:50:10.268
Mmm-hmm. in fact.
if you don't eat it.

1033
00:50:10.311 --> 00:50:11.965
they might even ask us
to leave.

1034
00:50:13.836 --> 00:50:15.099
Okay.

1035
00:50:15.142 --> 00:50:16.491
Shit. All right.

1036
00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:26.153
Oh. God.

1037
00:50:26.197 --> 00:50:28.025
Kyle.

1038
00:50:28.068 --> 00:50:29.765
Oh. God.Oh. Kyle.

1039
00:50:29.809 --> 00:50:32.942
I need a water.Here take mine. take mine.

1040
00:50:32.986 --> 00:50:35.162
I... I was kidding.

1041
00:50:38.687 --> 00:50:40.733
Jesus.

1042
00:50:40.776 --> 00:50:42.778
"It's extremely
disrespectful."

1043
00:50:42.822 --> 00:50:44.476
Kyle... Kyle.
you need to lighten up.

1044
00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:47.218
Oh. no. no.

1045
00:50:47.261 --> 00:50:48.523
Oh. no. no. no. no. no. no.

1046
00:50:48.567 --> 00:50:49.829
Don't spit it out because
now they really will

1047
00:50:49.872 --> 00:50:50.960
ask us to leave.

1048
00:50:51.004 --> 00:50:52.484
Okay. good. I'm ready to go.

1049
00:50:58.142 --> 00:50:59.534
Ziggy?

1050
00:50:59.578 --> 00:51:00.840
Yup?

1051
00:51:00.883 --> 00:51:01.971
Are you happy?

1052
00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:04.191
What?

1053
00:51:04.887 --> 00:51:06.063
Are you happy?

1054
00:51:07.934 --> 00:51:09.457
Are you really asking me?

1055
00:51:09.501 --> 00:51:10.502
Of course.

1056
00:51:12.025 --> 00:51:13.418
Um...

1057
00:51:13.461 --> 00:51:14.941
Yeah. I mean. I think so.

1058
00:51:18.075 --> 00:51:20.164
I mean. like. I'll have a
good thought in my head.

1059
00:51:20.207 --> 00:51:23.950
you know. like.
"You just wrote a lift song."

1060
00:51:23.993 --> 00:51:27.258
And. then. later I'll be
feeling bad about something.

1061
00:51:27.301 --> 00:51:29.173
I mean. it could be anything.

1062
00:51:29.216 --> 00:51:32.263
and the feeling
doesn't feel good anymore.

1063
00:51:32.306 --> 00:51:34.134
Does that make sense?

1064
00:51:34.178 --> 00:51:35.657
Like. I'll have
a logically good thought.

1065
00:51:35.701 --> 00:51:37.659
but my feeling is still bad.

1066
00:51:37.703 --> 00:51:40.314
And it just kills me because
it means that my thoughts

1067
00:51:40.358 --> 00:51:41.837
and my feelings
are disconnected.

1068
00:51:41.881 --> 00:51:42.925
and I could be
the most popular

1069
00:51:42.969 --> 00:51:44.144
songwriter in the world.

1070
00:51:44.188 --> 00:51:46.625
but it still won't
solve any real problems.

1071
00:51:46.668 --> 00:51:48.540
Because no matter what I do
in this world.

1072
00:51:48.583 --> 00:51:50.672
I'll always. kind of.
have a lingering pain.

1073
00:51:50.716 --> 00:51:51.847
Yeah.

1074
00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:53.893
Mmm.

1075
00:51:53.936 --> 00:51:55.416
Why are you asking me?

1076
00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:57.114
'Cause I'm reading

1079
00:52:01.727 --> 00:52:03.207
Oh.

middle class and educated.

1081

1082
00:52:10.039 --> 00:52:11.563
Okay. thanks. Dad.

Yes.
but I'll sit with you.

1089
00:52:24.228 --> 00:52:26.186

I opened the Malbec.
but it's not very good.

1091

1094

Dad's reading a fascinating
article about teen suicide.

1095
00:52:35.935 --> 00:52:37.806
So what did you eat
for dinner?

1096
00:52:41.854 --> 00:52:45.074
I took Marci to the
Ethiopian restaurant.

1097
00:52:45.118 --> 00:52:46.424
It was her second year
anniversary

1098
00:52:46.467 --> 00:52:47.686
of working at the shelter

1099
00:52:47.729 --> 00:52:49.818
and I wanted to do
something nice for her.

1100
00:52:49.862 --> 00:52:51.255
It was delicious.

1101
00:52:51.298 --> 00:52:54.214
We ate with our hands
and it was very interesting.

1102
00:52:54.258 --> 00:52:55.781
Yeah. I know.
I love that place.

1103
00:52:55.824 --> 00:52:57.217
Mmm.

1104
00:52:57.261 --> 00:52:58.479
No. you don't.

1105
00:52:58.523 --> 00:53:00.046
Of course I do.
we used to go all the time.

1106
00:53:00.089 --> 00:53:02.179
Yeah. and you told me
it made you feel dirty.

1107
00:53:02.222 --> 00:53:04.224
It did. I had lentils
and shit all over my hands.

1108
00:53:04.268 --> 00:53:05.704
but I still liked it.

1109
00:53:05.747 --> 00:53:08.446
Oh. I didn't realize.
Maybe we can go back sometime.

1110
00:53:08.489 --> 00:53:10.404
Yeah. sure. maybe.
I don't know.

1111
00:53:10.448 --> 00:53:12.232

It was work.

01:03:37.901 --> 01:03:38.945
Thank you. so... Yeah.

1230
01:03:38.989 --> 01:03:40.425
thanks so much anyways.

1231
01:03:40.468 --> 01:03:41.600
Um...

1232
01:03:44.995 --> 01:03:47.171
Oh. I. um. I think we'll have
some good news

1233
01:03:47.214 --> 01:03:49.695
from Oberlin tomorrow.

1234
01:03:49.738 --> 01:03:50.957
Very exciting!

1235
01:04:10.194 --> 01:04:12.109
I've secured two sponsorships.

1236
01:04:12.152 --> 01:04:14.067
both for $10K from Hair Today

1237
01:04:14.111 --> 01:04:15.329
and one
from the Clifford family.

1238
01:04:15.373 --> 01:04:16.896
Oh. well. that's tremendous.

1239
01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:18.419
Fred has never been
particularly eager

1240
01:04:18.463 --> 01:04:19.856
to part with his money.

1241
01:04:19.899 --> 01:04:22.641
But the downside

1242
01:04:22.684 --> 01:04:24.773
is we're only half sold
as of now.

1243
01:04:24.817 --> 01:04:25.905
I'm sorry. Evelyn.

1244
01:04:25.949 --> 01:04:26.993
Yeah. sorry.

1245
01:04:27.037 --> 01:04:28.386
Oh. no need to apologize.

1246
01:04:28.429 --> 01:04:29.778
You're doing the best you can.

1247
01:04:29.822 --> 01:04:32.564
But. last year
at this time. we were sold.

1248
01:04:32.607 --> 01:04:34.131
Don't be so hard on yourself.

1249
01:04:34.174 --> 01:04:37.612
Oh.
I'm sorry I'm interrupting.

1250
01:04:37.656 --> 01:04:38.875
You all right. Angie?

1251
01:04:38.918 --> 01:04:40.615
Uh. can I talk to you
for a sec?

1252
01:04:40.659 --> 01:04:42.530
Oh. yes. yes. of course.

1253
01:04:42.574 --> 01:04:43.705
I shall return.

1254
01:04:48.406 --> 01:04:49.973
I don't know
how to tell you this.

1255
01:04:50.016 --> 01:04:51.757
Well. tell me what?Well. it's about Kyle.

1256
01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:52.889
Oh. is he all right?

1257
01:04:52.932 --> 01:04:54.760
Is he hurt?No. he's fine.

1258
01:04:54.803 --> 01:04:55.979
Oh! Oh. good!

1259
01:04:56.022 --> 01:04:58.285
Oh. don't scare me like that.

1260
01:04:58.329 --> 01:04:59.896
Kyle's going to be fine.

1261
01:04:59.939 --> 01:05:01.027
Oh. no. I know that.

1262
01:05:01.071 --> 01:05:02.202
No. I don't think you do.

1263
01:05:02.246 --> 01:05:04.074
No. I do.
He is an amazing kid.

1264
01:05:04.117 --> 01:05:05.379
You're very lucky.

1265
01:05:05.858 --> 01:05:07.381
I'm lucky.

1266
01:05:07.425 --> 01:05:11.037
Well. I believe that
Kyle has told you his plans

1267
01:05:11.081 --> 01:05:13.561
on working with his father
after he finishes school

1268
01:05:13.605 --> 01:05:15.215
at his father's shop?

1269
01:05:15.259 --> 01:05:16.695
The car repair shop.

1270
01:05:16.738 --> 01:05:18.305
Right. the car repair shop.
yes.

1271
01:05:18.349 --> 01:05:19.872
Uh. yes. yes.
we've been discussing that

1272
01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:21.308
and I've been encouraging him

1273
01:05:21.352 --> 01:05:22.919
to think outside the box
a little bit.

1274
01:05:22.962 --> 01:05:24.442
There are some
wonderful programs

1275
01:05:24.485 --> 01:05:25.878
where I think
that Kyle would excel.

1276
01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:27.445
He's... He's very curious.

1277
01:05:27.488 --> 01:05:29.055
He's unusually sensitive.

1278
01:05:29.099 --> 01:05:30.230
Yeah. I know that.

1279
01:05:30.274 --> 01:05:32.798
Of course. you do.
you're his mother.

1280
01:05:32.841 --> 01:05:36.019
Yeah. well. Kyle feels good
working with his father.

1281
01:05:36.062 --> 01:05:38.108
He already works weekends.
He makes good money.

1282
01:05:38.151 --> 01:05:39.848
and he feels good
about himself.

1283
01:05:39.892 --> 01:05:41.285
and you're trying to
push him into someplace

1284
01:05:41.328 --> 01:05:42.721
that's gonna make
him feel stupid.

1285
01:05:42.764 --> 01:05:43.940
No one's gonna make

1286
01:05:43.983 --> 01:05:45.289
that boy feel anything
less than brilliant.

1287
01:05:45.332 --> 01:05:47.073
anything less than what he is.

1288
01:05:47.117 --> 01:05:49.946
Well. he feels good
working with his father.

1289
01:05:49.989 --> 01:05:52.122
maybe not brilliant. but he
feels good about himself.

1290
01:05:52.165 --> 01:05:53.688
Well. imagine how good...

1291
01:05:53.732 --> 01:05:56.430
Imagine how amazing he would
feel with a college degree.

1292
01:05:56.474 --> 01:05:57.562
with something that he had

1293
01:05:57.605 --> 01:05:59.129
no expectation
of ever getting.

1294
01:05:59.172 --> 01:06:02.001
I think he must feel pretty
amazing when someone says.

1295
01:06:02.045 --> 01:06:05.222
"Hey. kid. you fixed my car.
You're 17 years old.

1296
01:06:05.265 --> 01:06:07.485
"and you fixed a car that
hasn't turned over in a year.

1297
01:06:07.528 --> 01:06:09.139
"Now I can get
to work on time.

1298
01:06:09.182 --> 01:06:11.010
"Now I can pick my kids up
from school."

1299
01:06:11.054 --> 01:06:12.229
Yes. yes. yes.

1300
01:06:12.272 --> 01:06:14.579
and I'm sure
that is a wonderful feeling.

1301
01:06:14.622 --> 01:06:17.974
and that is exactly
what I am offering him.

1302
01:06:18.017 --> 01:06:20.585
that feeling times a million.

1303
01:06:20.628 --> 01:06:22.804
Okay. well we don't want it.

1304
01:06:24.502 --> 01:06:25.807
You don't...
You don't want it.

1305
01:06:25.851 --> 01:06:27.592
or does Kyle not want it?

1306
01:06:27.635 --> 01:06:29.289
Yeah. I don't want it.

1307
01:06:30.682 --> 01:06:31.900
I mean. I think
we're gonna need

1308
01:06:31.944 --> 01:06:33.641
that kind of space.

1309
01:06:33.685 --> 01:06:36.035
Yeah. I mean.
it's a little echoey.

1310
01:06:36.079 --> 01:06:37.994
but the biggest problem
I'm having is Steven.

1311
01:06:38.037 --> 01:06:40.126
He's. like. texting me
every five minutes.

1312
01:06:40.170 --> 01:06:42.302
He thinks he's gonna be
the emcee.

1313
01:06:42.346 --> 01:06:43.477
He's working on his jokes.

1314
01:06:43.521 --> 01:06:44.870
but we're gonna
have kids there.

1315
01:06:44.913 --> 01:06:46.654
Well. I think the kids
are more important

1316
01:06:46.698 --> 01:06:49.483
as far as the community
and everything is involved.

1317
01:07:57.986 --> 01:07:59.553
Paging Kyle Marks.

1318
01:07:59.597 --> 01:08:01.555
Would Kyle Marks please
report to the office?

1319
01:08:01.599 --> 01:08:05.081
I repeat. would Kyle Marks
please report to the office?

1320
01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:08.649
Hey. get me a muffin!Yo. shut up. man!

1321
01:08:11.696 --> 01:08:13.872
Oh. my God.
haven't you seen that?

1322
01:08:13.915 --> 01:08:15.265
I know. it's like.
I don't even know

1323
01:08:15.308 --> 01:08:16.614
what to wear.

1324
01:08:18.572 --> 01:08:21.053
It's like.
you're egotistical. Really?

1325
01:08:21.097 --> 01:08:22.359
What. narcissism
and arrogance?

1326
01:08:22.402 --> 01:08:24.100
Well. I...

1327
01:08:24.143 --> 01:08:25.971
Yo. yo. yo.
how's it going everybody?

1328
01:08:26.014 --> 01:08:27.233
Hey. Lila.

1329
01:08:27.277 --> 01:08:28.539
Sit down. sit down.
Troubadour.

1330
01:08:28.582 --> 01:08:29.757
Oh. lift!

1331
01:08:29.801 --> 01:08:32.369
Cool. no. I don't
wanna interrupt anything.

1332
01:08:32.412 --> 01:08:34.588
So. uh. what are you guys
talking about?

1333
01:08:34.632 --> 01:08:36.590
Becky's thinking about
getting her tongue pierced.

1334
01:08:36.634 --> 01:08:38.070
Which is obviously
a terrible idea.

1335
01:08:38.114 --> 01:08:39.158
Yes. I am. It's my tongue.

1336
01:08:39.202 --> 01:08:40.464
Uh-uh. not after you
get it pierced.

1337
01:08:40.507 --> 01:08:41.595
then it's the world's tongue.

1338
01:08:41.639 --> 01:08:42.988
You know that!I just thought you guys

1339
01:08:43.031 --> 01:08:44.294
were talking
about political stuff

1340
01:08:44.337 --> 01:08:46.034
like you usually do.It is political.

1341
01:08:46.078 --> 01:08:47.123
It's my body.

1342
01:08:47.166 --> 01:08:48.298
It's an important muscle.

1343
01:08:48.341 --> 01:08:50.517
You will have no taste buds.Stop being rude.

1344
01:08:50.561 --> 01:08:52.911
Oh. no. I just want
like world politics

1345
01:08:52.954 --> 01:08:55.087
'cause Lila and I were kind
of working on this song

1346
01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:56.175
for the Marshall Islands.

1347
01:08:56.219 --> 01:08:58.046
Oh. really?Yeah. um.

1348
01:08:58.090 --> 01:09:00.527
Ziggy did. like. the weirdest.
possibly nicest thing.

1349
01:09:00.571 --> 01:09:02.877
He took this poem I wrote
and set it to music.

1350
01:09:02.921 --> 01:09:04.966
Yeah. that's actually
why I came over here.

1351
01:09:05.010 --> 01:09:07.230
I played it last night
on Hi-Hat.

1352
01:09:07.273 --> 01:09:09.101
That's where I have
20.000 followers.

1353
01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:10.537
and I'm validated
and starred and everything.

1354
01:09:10.581 --> 01:09:12.148
You told us.Oh. really?

1355
01:09:12.191 --> 01:09:13.584
Mmm-hmm.Oh. lift.

1356
01:09:13.627 --> 01:09:15.542
Anyways. I don't really
sing about political shit.

1357
01:09:15.586 --> 01:09:17.631
'cause I feel like people
don't really like that stuff.

1358
01:09:17.675 --> 01:09:18.937
and also it doesn't
really translate

1359
01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:20.591
because of
the language barrier.

1360
01:09:20.634 --> 01:09:22.114
but I played
the Marshall Islands song

1361
01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:25.248
last night. right?
And I got. like. 83 up notes.

1362
01:09:25.291 --> 01:09:27.075
which translates
to. like. 90 bucks

1363
01:09:27.119 --> 01:09:29.077
before Hi-Hat deductions.CYRIL: Hmm.

1364
01:09:29.121 --> 01:09:30.557
And it's so funny.
'cause you. Lila.

1365
01:09:30.601 --> 01:09:33.647
you said that I had a huge
platform to be political.

1366
01:09:33.691 --> 01:09:35.214
And I never really wanted
to do that

1367
01:09:35.258 --> 01:09:36.911
because I thought it'd make me
less money.

1368
01:09:36.955 --> 01:09:40.393
but last night proves that
I can both be political

1369
01:09:40.437 --> 01:09:42.003
and make money.

1370
01:09:42.047 --> 01:09:44.397
Wow.Isn't that awesome?

1371
01:09:46.225 --> 01:09:47.226
Kyle!

1372
01:09:47.835 --> 01:09:49.837
Hello!

1373
01:09:52.492 --> 01:09:54.581
How are you. dear?Uh. I'm fine.

1374
01:09:54.625 --> 01:09:56.801
What's up. Evelyn?Oh. I had to speak to you...

1375
01:09:56.844 --> 01:09:58.455
Oh. forgive me.It's cool.

1376
01:09:58.498 --> 01:10:01.240
Is my mom okay?Oh. yes. Angie's fine.

1377
01:10:01.284 --> 01:10:02.676
Oh. actually. I don't know.

1378
01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:04.243
I really don't know...Wait. what happened?

1379
01:10:04.287 --> 01:10:06.071
I just spoke to her.

1380
01:10:06.114 --> 01:10:08.813
and she said that. um.
that you and she had discussed

1381
01:10:08.856 --> 01:10:10.554
what we had been
working on together.

1382
01:10:10.597 --> 01:10:15.428
and I wanted to get
some clarity on the situation.

1383
01:10:15.472 --> 01:10:16.908
Shit! Um...

1384
01:10:17.952 --> 01:10:19.302
I'm sorry about that.

1385
01:10:19.345 --> 01:10:20.738
What did she say?

1386
01:10:20.781 --> 01:10:22.174
Well. she said
that she was worried

1387
01:10:22.218 --> 01:10:24.220
that you wouldn't fit in
with the other students.

1388
01:10:24.263 --> 01:10:26.004
and that you wouldn't excel.

1389
01:10:26.047 --> 01:10:28.963
and both you and I know
that that could not be further

1390
01:10:29.007 --> 01:10:30.704
from the truth.

1391
01:10:30.748 --> 01:10:33.751
But I inferred
from what she said to me

1392
01:10:33.794 --> 01:10:35.056
that I may have overstepped.

1393
01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:37.015
and if I have.
I would be mortified.

1394
01:10:37.058 --> 01:10:38.146
Frankly. I would be mortified.

1395
01:10:38.190 --> 01:10:39.278
You know. she's just. well...

1396
01:10:39.322 --> 01:10:41.367
She's been
really emotional lately.

1397
01:10:42.325 --> 01:10:43.978
I told her not to talk to you.

1398
01:10:44.022 --> 01:10:46.633
Okay. okay. well.
I understand.

1399
01:10:46.677 --> 01:10:48.940
I mean. she's a good mother.
She's a very concerned mother.

1400
01:10:48.983 --> 01:10:50.855
and we've all been there.

1401
01:10:50.898 --> 01:10:52.596
and it's a big change.

1402
01:10:52.639 --> 01:10:56.295
I mean. not just for you.
but for your entire family.

1403
01:10:56.339 --> 01:11:00.604
Yeah. uh.
and what if I don't want it?

1404
01:11:01.431 --> 01:11:02.562
Don't want what?

1405
01:11:02.606 --> 01:11:03.824
School and all that.

1406
01:11:05.348 --> 01:11:08.220
Um. 'cause I don't think
that I really want to go.

1407
01:11:08.264 --> 01:11:10.309
I'm sorry. I know that you've
been thinking about it a lot

1408
01:11:10.353 --> 01:11:11.484
and that it's important
to you.

1409
01:11:11.528 --> 01:11:14.400
Just. uh. I talked to my dad

1410
01:11:14.444 --> 01:11:16.533
and. uh. we all think it's
a good idea

1411
01:11:16.576 --> 01:11:18.143
if I start working
with him more.

1412
01:11:19.144 --> 01:11:20.493
Ziggy. do not follow me.

1413
01:11:20.537 --> 01:11:22.147
Lila. just explain
to me what I did wrong?

1414
01:11:22.190 --> 01:11:23.757
Why are you so fucking stupid?

1415
01:11:23.801 --> 01:11:25.324
Maybe I am. I just.
I thought you'd be proud.

1416
01:11:25.368 --> 01:11:28.632
Oh. proud? Proud?
How could I be proud?

1417
01:11:28.675 --> 01:11:29.763
You exploited me.

1418
01:11:29.807 --> 01:11:31.243
You exploited
the fucking poor people

1419
01:11:31.287 --> 01:11:32.549
in the Marshall Islands

1420
01:11:32.592 --> 01:11:34.420
like they have any more
reason to be miserable.

1421
01:11:34.464 --> 01:11:35.595
and you exploited yourself.

1422
01:11:35.639 --> 01:11:37.249
How the fuck
did I exploit anyone?

1423
01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:39.817
I wrote this killer
fucking lift song with you.

1424
01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:40.948
We worked together.

1425
01:11:40.992 --> 01:11:42.602
and I used it
to raise awareness

1426
01:11:42.646 --> 01:11:44.082
for a major world problem.

1427
01:11:44.125 --> 01:11:46.476
And then you would have
the audacity to brag about it

1428
01:11:46.519 --> 01:11:48.608
to me
like you're a fucking god.

1429
01:11:48.652 --> 01:11:50.654
Changing the world
takes doing real work

1430
01:11:50.697 --> 01:11:53.047
and actually giving
a shit about real people.

1431
01:11:53.091 --> 01:11:54.135
You can't...But maybe

1432
01:11:54.179 --> 01:11:55.528
I can change things.You can't.

1433
01:11:55.572 --> 01:11:57.225
No. maybe we can. like a team.

1434
01:11:57.269 --> 01:11:59.837
We're not a team. Ziggy.
You're like a little boy.

1435
01:12:01.534 --> 01:12:02.753
I know that's scary.

1436
01:12:02.796 --> 01:12:04.581
We all have imposter syndrome.

1437
01:12:04.624 --> 01:12:06.191
I understand that.

1438
01:12:06.234 --> 01:12:08.933
I am constantly striving
to have my character

1439
01:12:08.976 --> 01:12:10.195
match up to my ideals...

1440
01:12:10.238 --> 01:12:11.762
Okay. okay. yeah.
No. I understand.

1441
01:12:11.805 --> 01:12:14.330
But it steels you.
it strengthens you.

1442
01:12:14.373 --> 01:12:16.375
It's the only way
to learn and to grow

1443
01:12:16.419 --> 01:12:18.725
and to live
a more examined life.

1444
01:12:18.769 --> 01:12:20.074
to make an impact.Not that...

1445
01:12:20.118 --> 01:12:21.641
Don't you want that?Yeah. I guess.

1446
01:12:21.685 --> 01:12:24.078
Yes. of course you do. Because
that is what everyone wants.

1447
01:12:24.122 --> 01:12:25.645
I know. I just can't really
think about it right now.

1448
01:12:25.689 --> 01:12:26.864
No. but right now is the time.

1449
01:12:26.907 --> 01:12:28.256
Right now is the time
that you have

1450
01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:29.345
to think about it.Evelyn. just please. stop!

1451
01:12:29.388 --> 01:12:30.476
Just. please.

1452

Please!

1454

I'm sorry. Oh. no. no.

1455
01:12:48.668 --> 01:12:50.714
You're not gonna. like.
kick us out. right?

1456
01:12:50.757 --> 01:12:52.280
What?

1457
01:12:52.324 --> 01:12:54.413
Like. if I don't
go to college.

1458
01:12:54.457 --> 01:12:56.372
you're not gonna
make us leave. right?

1459
01:12:59.244 --> 01:13:02.073
Oh. God. Oh. my God.
no. I mean.

1460
01:13:02.116 --> 01:13:03.988
oh. Kyle. these things are...

1461
01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:07.165
Okay.These things are separate.

1462
01:13:07.208 --> 01:13:10.777
These things are totally
separate. They're not...

1463

All right. thank... Thank you.
Really. thank you. Ms. Katz.

Well. she is.

1466
01:13:19.743 --> 01:13:21.179
