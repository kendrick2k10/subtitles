5
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.867
Look. there it goes
right there.

6
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.400
Oh. I see it.

7
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.233
Oh. there it is. Oh.

8
00:00:39.367 --> 00:00:40.934
Striped shore crab.

9
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:42.800
Definitely a striped
shore crab.

10
00:00:42.934 --> 00:00:45.066
And look at that sunset.

11
00:00:45.767 --> 00:00:47.934
Oh.

12
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:49.800
There's something magical about

13
00:00:49.934 --> 00:00:51.633
a sunset over the ocean.
isn't there?

14
00:00:51.767 --> 00:00:52.767
It's not magic. Grandma.

15
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.400
It's a scientific phenomenon

16
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:55.900
called light scattering.

17
00:00:56.033 --> 00:00:59.133
I know you're my little science
genius but I promise you

18
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:03.667
that magic is everywhere
and it's very real.

19
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.600
But how can you prove it?

20
00:01:05.734 --> 00:01:07.734
I can't prove it.

21
00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:10.633
That's what makes it magic.

22
00:01:10.767 --> 00:01:12.133
Take my engagement ring.

23
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:15.667
That is a golden pearl
from the South Sea.

24
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.200
From a golden-lipped oyster.

25
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.934
One of the rarest
gems in the ocean.

26
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:21.166
Your grandfather found it

27
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.300
when he was in service
in the Philippines.

28
00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:24.433
Wow.

29
00:01:24.567 --> 00:01:26.367
Can I try it on again?

30
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.900
Uh-hmm.

31
00:01:29.934 --> 00:01:33.000
That's the symbol of love
between me and your grandpa.

32
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:36.800
And that love brought us
our family and our children

33
00:01:36.934 --> 00:01:39.100
and our grandchildren.

34
00:01:39.233 --> 00:01:43.300
If that's not magic.
I don't know what is.

35
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.633
Yeah.

36
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.834
Are we there yet?

37
00:02:00.967 --> 00:02:03.233
What-- sorry.
what. Dad?

38
00:02:03.367 --> 00:02:04.867
Are we there yet?

39
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.400
Dad. you're the one driving.

40
00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:08.033
That's right. I forgot.

41
00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:09.533
I'm trying to keep you
from getting

42
00:02:09.667 --> 00:02:11.066
blisters on your fingers.

43
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.100
You're gonna wear
those things out.

44
00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:15.166
I think I smell smoke
coming off of you.

45
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.200
Okay. Look.
I have a lot of loose ends

46
00:02:17.333 --> 00:02:19.700
that I have to wrap up
before we take off. That's all.

47
00:02:19.834 --> 00:02:22.533
All this wedding
stuff is exhausting.

48
00:02:23.266 --> 00:02:25.667
Mm. The things we do
for love. right?

49
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.567
The only truly good reason
to do anything.

50
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.867
Oh. hey.
Pull up to the left over here.

51
00:02:35.667 --> 00:02:37.066
Excellent choice.

52
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.500
Ryan will take care of you
at the counter.

53
00:02:38.633 --> 00:02:39.867
Thank you.

54
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.433
- Hi.
- Hey.

55
00:02:41.567 --> 00:02:43.033
I'm just here to pick up

56
00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:44.266
the bands for
the Strickland/Watson wedding.

57
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.934
Strickland/Watson. yes.

58
00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:48.100
I have them right
here ready to go.

59
00:02:50.834 --> 00:02:52.433
- How do they look?
- Oh.

60
00:02:52.567 --> 00:02:53.967
They look perfect.

61
00:02:54.767 --> 00:02:56.667
Seems you're wearing
your engagement ring

62
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.734
on the wrong hand.

63
00:02:57.867 --> 00:02:59.000
Oh. uh.

64
00:02:59.133 --> 00:03:01.066
No. I mean. yes.
no. you're right.

65
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.734
Sorry.
It is an engagement ring.

66
00:03:02.867 --> 00:03:04.100
It's just--
it's not my engagement ring.

67
00:03:04.233 --> 00:03:06.767
It's a keepsake
from my grandma.

68
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.133
My sister's the one
getting married.

69
00:03:08.266 --> 00:03:09.500
I'm just her maid of honor.

70
00:03:09.633 --> 00:03:11.433
May I take a closer look?

71
00:03:11.567 --> 00:03:12.767
Yeah. sure.

72
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.867
- It's so beautiful.
- Thank you.

73
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.300
Such a unique band.

74
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.266
Diamonds complementing
a South Sea Pearl.

75
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.734
I would love the opportunity
to appraise it for you.

76
00:03:23.867 --> 00:03:24.934
free of charge.

77
00:03:25.066 --> 00:03:27.400
No. this ring is and always

78
00:03:27.533 --> 00:03:29.133
will be priceless to me.

79
00:03:33.233 --> 00:03:34.934
Hello.
this is Kate with Dear Watson.

80
00:03:35.066 --> 00:03:36.633
How can I be helpful
to you today?

81
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.400
Oh. I'm sorry that
you're having a sizing issue.

82
00:03:40.533 --> 00:03:42.900
My team is gonna help you
find something
that fits you perfectly.

83
00:03:43.033 --> 00:03:45.633
And if they can't
then we will make something
that fits you perfectly.

84
00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:48.600
Yes. I am. in fact. Kate Watson.

85
00:03:48.734 --> 00:03:50.166
Yes. the Kate Watson.

86
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.433
Oh. well. the pleasure
is all mine. Hi.

87
00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:56.400
Hi. Are you taking
customer service calls
during your final fitting?

88
00:03:56.533 --> 00:03:58.900
I don't wanna be too out
of touch with the customers
when we get back.

89
00:03:59.033 --> 00:04:00.500
You can send me another call.

90
00:04:00.633 --> 00:04:01.500
No. no. no. no. Don't.

91
00:04:01.633 --> 00:04:02.667
don't send her another call.

92
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.867
No.

93
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.734
Okay. Come here.
All right.

94
00:04:05.867 --> 00:04:06.900
So ladies and gentlemen.

95
00:04:07.033 --> 00:04:08.467
I have a little gift

96
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.800
for our bride-to-be.

97
00:04:10.934 --> 00:04:13.033
All right.
This right here

98
00:04:13.166 --> 00:04:16.900
is an official bride card
issued to Kate Watson.

99
00:04:17.033 --> 00:04:19.567
It is valid through the end
of her honeymoon

100
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.967
and it entitles the bearer
to get out of any

101
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.400
unnecessary work duties

102
00:04:23.533 --> 00:04:24.567
and get her way

103
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.834
whenever she sees fit.

104
00:04:25.967 --> 00:04:28.200
Hmm.
This could come in handy.

105
00:04:28.333 --> 00:04:29.633
Uh-hmm. Use it wisely.

106
00:04:29.767 --> 00:04:32.066
Okay. So this means
that as of this moment.

107
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.667
the boss is unplugged
and off the grid.

108
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.300
So filter any pressing issues

109
00:04:36.433 --> 00:04:38.367
through me
and I will handle it.

110
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.133
This is for your own good.
I promise.

111
00:04:41.266 --> 00:04:42.166
Fine.

112
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.800
- Hi. guys.
- Hey.

113
00:04:43.934 --> 00:04:45.333
Who put your fiancÃ©
in the corner?

114
00:04:45.467 --> 00:04:47.533
You know he can't see me
in my dress before the wedding.

115
00:04:47.667 --> 00:04:49.400
Well. you showed me
all your designs beforehand.

116
00:04:49.533 --> 00:04:51.900
so I really don't see
why it matters.

117
00:04:52.033 --> 00:04:53.400
- It matters.
- It matters.

118
00:04:53.533 --> 00:04:54.834
Okay. Yeah.

119
00:04:54.967 --> 00:04:56.734
This way.
I've got something.

120
00:04:56.867 --> 00:04:58.934
Thank you so much.

121
00:04:59.967 --> 00:05:01.767
The coast is clear.

122
00:05:09.433 --> 00:05:10.900
I got it.

123
00:05:11.033 --> 00:05:12.633
Thank you. Mom.

124
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.133
Okay. So...
I know that we're all gonna
have a fantastic time this week

125
00:05:18.266 --> 00:05:19.433
but before we get
everything rolling.

126
00:05:19.567 --> 00:05:21.934
I just wanted us all
to be together

127
00:05:22.066 --> 00:05:23.266
when I give Addie

128
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.867
her maid of honor gift.

129
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.633
Aw.

130
00:05:26.767 --> 00:05:28.433
Okay.

131
00:05:28.567 --> 00:05:30.900
Ooh. okay. okay.

132
00:05:31.033 --> 00:05:33.367
Now. you're already acting
like my full partner
in the company but

133
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.967
I just wanted
to make it official. in writing.

134
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.200
Full partners. 50/50.

135
00:05:39.333 --> 00:05:40.800
until the wheels come off.

136
00:05:40.934 --> 00:05:42.233
Isn't it wonderful?

137
00:05:42.367 --> 00:05:43.767
Well. if it isn't wonderful.

138
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.734
I don't know what is.

139
00:05:45.867 --> 00:05:48.800
I just--
I wasn't expecting this.

140
00:05:48.934 --> 00:05:51.567
I-- wow.

141
00:05:52.734 --> 00:05:53.767
I'm so grateful.

142
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.867
I just wanted to show you

143
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.133
how much I appreciate you.

144
00:05:57.266 --> 00:05:59.400
I know that you do
but this is--

145
00:05:59.533 --> 00:06:01.000
I mean.
this is too much. Kate.

146
00:06:01.133 --> 00:06:02.967
You deserve it.
You're the glue

147
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.633
for the family.

148
00:06:04.767 --> 00:06:07.000
for the company.
for the wedding.

149
00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:09.266
We all lean on you
for support.

150
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.567
Come here.

151
00:06:13.333 --> 00:06:16.367
Okay. So you look over
the contract when you have time

152
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.533
and we'll dot the I's and cross
the T's when we get back.

153
00:06:20.667 --> 00:06:21.767
Okay.

154
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:22.867
Oh. here.

155
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.834
- It's so pretty.
- I know.

156
00:07:03.133 --> 00:07:04.066
Whoa.

157
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.934
Look at this place.

158
00:07:06.066 --> 00:07:07.667
- Hi.
- Hi.

159
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.600
We're checking in for
the Strickland/Watson wedding.

160
00:07:09.734 --> 00:07:10.767
I'm Addie Watson.

161
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.266
I think you have four
reservations under my name?

162
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.734
Yes. indeed. Right.

163
00:07:13.867 --> 00:07:16.600
I have four rooms
including the Bridal Suite.

164
00:07:16.734 --> 00:07:20.100
Yes. that is correct.
We're the first wave of people.

165
00:07:20.233 --> 00:07:22.667
so more should be checking in
later tonight or tomorrow.

166
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.400
We will be ready
and waiting to greet them.

167
00:07:25.533 --> 00:07:27.533
I'm going to sleep off
the jet lag.

168
00:07:27.667 --> 00:07:29.900
Wake me up for
the welcome party thingy.

169
00:07:30.033 --> 00:07:32.567
Don't worry.
I'll have him back in time. Okay.

170
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.834
I'll make sure that
your bags get to your rooms

171
00:07:34.967 --> 00:07:37.934
but before I do.
I would like to introduce you
to our concierge

172
00:07:38.066 --> 00:07:40.000
and event coordinator. Hannah.

173
00:07:40.133 --> 00:07:41.567
Thank you. Angie.

174
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.266
I'm here to help you
with everything and anything

175
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.000
you might need to make your
stay with us more enjoyable.

176
00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:49.200
No request is too big
or too small.

177
00:07:49.333 --> 00:07:50.867
as long as
it's nothing too weird.

178
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.700
- And how weird is too weird?
- Weird is a relative term.

179
00:07:53.834 --> 00:07:57.166
especially when describing
one of your relatives perhaps.

180
00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.500
Rest assured it's my job
to manage the weird

181
00:08:00.633 --> 00:08:03.633
and make sure your event
all goes smoothly.

182
00:08:03.767 --> 00:08:05.467
Now that you've got boots
on the ground.

183
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.200
I'd like to take you
for a quick tour of the resort.

184
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.166
If you'll kindly follow me.

185
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.266
This is our dolphin habitat.

186
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.166
Our dolphins get
expert care from the amazing

187
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.166
Dolphin Quest staff.

188
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.667
To the left is the pool.

189
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.900
It's open 24 hours a day.

190
00:08:24.033 --> 00:08:25.500
And our beach cafÃ©

191
00:08:25.633 --> 00:08:28.433
has a frozen coconut mojito
that's to die for.

192
00:08:28.567 --> 00:08:30.834
- I will be there.
- Right. right?

193
00:08:30.967 --> 00:08:32.633
Scooch on over here

194
00:08:32.767 --> 00:08:36.800
and this is where
the magic will happen.

195
00:08:37.633 --> 00:08:39.633
- This is fantastic.
- And it seems

196
00:08:39.767 --> 00:08:43.133
the weather will be on our side
for your entire stay.

197
00:08:43.266 --> 00:08:44.166
That is great news.

198
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.800
I said it seems that way

199
00:08:45.934 --> 00:08:47.467
but we are in Hawaii.

200
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.934
so no promises.

201
00:08:49.066 --> 00:08:51.400
You actually signed a weather
waiver in your contract

202
00:08:51.533 --> 00:08:54.100
that clears us of liability in
the case of inclement weather.

203
00:08:54.233 --> 00:08:55.266
What did we sign?

204
00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.266
Hey. it's fine.
It's fine. right?

205
00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.734
If we have rain.
we'll have rainbows.

206
00:08:58.867 --> 00:09:00.200
Couldn't agree more.

207
00:09:00.333 --> 00:09:02.066
Now what do you say

208
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.033
we iron the details out
with your fully

209
00:09:04.166 --> 00:09:06.166
capable maid of honor
and let you

210
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.867
and your betrothed
enjoy the rest of the day.

211
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.066
Have fun.

212
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.266
- All right. Let's get to it.
- Okay.

213
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.734
Hi. This is Addie Watson.
I'm just calling to get

214
00:09:44.867 --> 00:09:47.000
some more general information
about enrolling

215
00:09:47.133 --> 00:09:48.033
in your summer program.

216
00:09:51.033 --> 00:09:51.900
Yeah. I--

217
00:09:52.033 --> 00:09:53.400
you know. I'm so sorry.

218
00:09:53.533 --> 00:09:55.066
I'm gonna have
to call you right back.

219
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.533
Okay. Thank you.

220
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.233
- Hello.
- Hi. Kara.

221
00:10:00.367 --> 00:10:01.667
Did you just get in?

222
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.400
Oh. straight from the airport
to your door.

223
00:10:03.533 --> 00:10:04.800
Yeah. it's too early
for me to check in.

224
00:10:04.934 --> 00:10:06.233
Can I change here?

225
00:10:06.367 --> 00:10:07.300
I wanna make it
to paddle-board yoga.

226
00:10:07.433 --> 00:10:09.333
No. yeah. Of course.

227
00:10:09.467 --> 00:10:11.133
Are you not going?

228
00:10:11.266 --> 00:10:13.400
Um. no. No. I'm not.

229
00:10:13.533 --> 00:10:15.967
Something actually just came up
that I have to deal with.

230
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.166
Kara.

231
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.500
Ah! Kate.

232
00:10:18.633 --> 00:10:19.367
Hey.

233
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.300
Ooh. I am so glad
you could make it.

234
00:10:21.433 --> 00:10:23.633
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

235
00:10:23.767 --> 00:10:26.166
Okay. Now. what do you mean
you're not going to yoga?

236
00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.233
I just came in here to get you.

237
00:10:27.367 --> 00:10:28.700
Something just came up.

238
00:10:28.834 --> 00:10:30.667
so just go without me.
you guys. It's fine.

239
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.867
What came up?
Bridesmaids things?

240
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.667
I want you to be able
to enjoy yourself on this trip.

241
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.967
Maybe Kara can take
some of that off your plate?

242
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.767
Hmm. Put me in. coach.

243
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.667
It's fine. It's fine.

244
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.633
- I will go.
- You will love it.

245
00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:45.400
You will feel
so energized afterwards.

246
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.734
Chaturanga.
upward dog. everyone arms up.

247
00:10:51.867 --> 00:10:54.500
Inhale.

248
00:10:54.633 --> 00:10:57.900
Exhale. Swan dive down.

249
00:10:58.033 --> 00:10:59.734
Forward fold.

250
00:11:01.433 --> 00:11:03.934
Arms up. halfway up.

251
00:11:14.166 --> 00:11:16.233
Love and light.

252
00:11:22.834 --> 00:11:26.934
Let go of any anxiety
with this final flow.

253
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.200
Thank you for letting me
instruct you

254
00:11:30.333 --> 00:11:32.200
on this beautiful morning.

255
00:11:32.333 --> 00:11:35.567
Namaste.

256
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.400
That was just what I needed.

257
00:11:37.533 --> 00:11:38.967
How was it for you. Ad?

258
00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:40.300
Oh. yes. So relaxing.

259
00:11:40.433 --> 00:11:41.800
Not stressful at all.

260
00:11:46.934 --> 00:11:48.400
What's wrong?

261
00:11:48.533 --> 00:11:50.967
My ring. I lost my ring.

262
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.900
I lost my ring.

263
00:11:54.033 --> 00:11:55.767
Are you sure you didn't
leave it back at the hotel?

264
00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:57.800
No. no. no. I never take off
my ring. I don't...

265
00:11:57.934 --> 00:11:59.700
Wait. wait.
hold on. take a breath.

266
00:11:59.834 --> 00:12:01.467
Let it out.
It's gonna be fine.

267
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.667
- We'll help you find it.
- Yeah.

268
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.266
- Okay.
- Yeah. Hey. no. Addie.

269
00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.500
it's really deep out there.
We need help. Hannah.

270
00:12:06.633 --> 00:12:07.633
- Yeah.
- We'll ask Hannah.

271
00:12:07.767 --> 00:12:09.133
Maybe she'll have some ideas.

272
00:12:09.266 --> 00:12:10.400
- Come on.
- Great idea.

273
00:12:11.467 --> 00:12:12.800
Ad. come on.

274
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.600
It's right through
those double doors.

275
00:12:15.734 --> 00:12:18.066
You're welcome.
Have a great day.

276
00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.600
Hi.

277
00:12:21.734 --> 00:12:23.333
How did you enjoy
the yoga session?

278
00:12:23.467 --> 00:12:25.467
Yoga was great. Unfortunately.

279
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.100
- Addie lost her ring in the bay.
- Yeah.

280
00:12:27.233 --> 00:12:29.033
It's an incredibly
important family heirloom.

281
00:12:29.166 --> 00:12:30.867
I'm terribly sorry
to hear that.

282
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.934
Fortunately. our dive instructor
might be able to help.

283
00:12:34.066 --> 00:12:35.633
- Okay.
- He has a high recovery rate.

284
00:12:35.767 --> 00:12:36.967
- Oh. great.
- Okay. Uh...

285
00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.200
That sounds great.
Where can I find him?

286
00:12:38.333 --> 00:12:40.133
Shoot.

287
00:12:40.266 --> 00:12:41.800
Shoot what? Why shoot?

288
00:12:41.934 --> 00:12:43.100
Today is his day off.

289
00:12:43.233 --> 00:12:44.834
He will be back
with us tomorrow.

290
00:12:45.734 --> 00:12:48.367
Hannah. this ring
is incredibly important to me.

291
00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:49.700
Is there any way that we can.

292
00:12:49.834 --> 00:12:52.100
like. get him
on the phone or something?

293
00:12:52.233 --> 00:12:54.533
Jack is extremely off grid.

294
00:12:54.667 --> 00:12:57.000
He doesn't have a cell phone.

295
00:12:57.133 --> 00:12:59.333
But even if he did.
he probably wouldn't answer it.

296
00:12:59.467 --> 00:13:03.266
Okay. I don't-- maybe you could
tell me where I can find him.

297
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.367
Like. please.
I will make it worth his while.

298
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.900
I promise. I just. I don't wanna
waste another second on this.

299
00:13:08.033 --> 00:13:09.233
- Please.
- I'm never gonna hear

300
00:13:09.367 --> 00:13:12.667
the end of this but Jack lives

301
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.600
on a sailboat at the Marina.

302
00:13:14.734 --> 00:13:17.000
It's called
the Gem of the Ocean.

303
00:13:17.133 --> 00:13:18.734
The Gem of the Ocean.
Okay. Thank you.

304
00:13:18.867 --> 00:13:20.100
- Thank you so much.
- I'll get you

305
00:13:20.233 --> 00:13:21.900
- the address of the harbor.
- Okay.

306
00:13:22.033 --> 00:13:23.233
- Do you want us to go with you?
- No. no. no.

307
00:13:23.367 --> 00:13:25.033
No. it's okay. it's okay.

308
00:13:25.166 --> 00:13:26.900
Actually. Kara. can you help me
set up Kate's welcome brunch?

309
00:13:27.033 --> 00:13:28.066
Yeah. of course.

310
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.667
You got it.
Okay. Thank you.

311
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.433
I promise I will be back
before it even starts. okay?

312
00:13:31.567 --> 00:13:32.600
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

313
00:13:32.734 --> 00:13:34.166
- You're welcome.
- Sorry.

314
00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.433
- Just go. Go. go. go.
- Yeah. See you in a bit.

315
00:13:35.567 --> 00:13:37.533
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

316
00:13:46.367 --> 00:13:47.734
Ahoy there.

317
00:13:48.834 --> 00:13:49.900
Hi.

318
00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.100
Are you Jack Wilder?

319
00:13:53.233 --> 00:13:54.834
That depends who's asking.

320
00:13:54.967 --> 00:13:57.367
Well. that would be me. Um...

321
00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.266
I'm Addie Watson. I'm...

322
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.133
staying at the resort actually.

323
00:14:01.266 --> 00:14:04.834
Um... I lost my ring in the bay
this morning

324
00:14:04.967 --> 00:14:07.667
and I was told that you might
be able to help me get it back.

325
00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.133
If the resort.
meaning Hannah.

326
00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:11.667
told you where to find me.

327
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.867
she probably also told you
that today is my day off?

328
00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:16.100
Yes. Yes. she did.

329
00:14:16.233 --> 00:14:19.667
But I really twisted
her arm on that one.

330
00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.266
I'll be at the Dive Bungalow
bright and early

331
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.166
tomorrow morning. 7:00 AM.

332
00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.667
Well. look. this ring is--

333
00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.600
it's incredibly
important to me.

334
00:14:26.734 --> 00:14:28.433
Like really.
really important.

335
00:14:28.567 --> 00:14:30.233
- Yeah. sure. I'm sure it is.
- Yeah.

336
00:14:30.367 --> 00:14:32.667
But the fact remains.
I'll be at the Dive Bungalow

337
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.166
bright and early tomorrow
morning at 7:00 AM.

338
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.433
Um. is there any way
that I could get you

339
00:14:38.567 --> 00:14:41.166
to start the search today? I--

340
00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.900
Look I will make it
worth your while.

341
00:14:44.033 --> 00:14:45.867
Okay. I promise you.

342
00:14:47.633 --> 00:14:50.133
Please.
please just help me out here.

343
00:14:50.266 --> 00:14:51.500
Um. okay. Look.

344
00:14:51.633 --> 00:14:54.600
you don't understand. okay?

345
00:14:59.533 --> 00:15:01.600
Look. I really need
this ring back.

346
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.467
I did not expect that.

347
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.333
Yeah.
I surprised myself actually.

348
00:15:12.467 --> 00:15:14.500
Here. put this on.

349
00:15:14.633 --> 00:15:17.033
Uh. no. no. no. no.

350
00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:18.967
- I know how to swim.
- My boat. my rules.

351
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.333
I'm responsible
for your safety
when you're on my boat.

352
00:15:21.467 --> 00:15:24.767
so put the jacket on. please.

353
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.066
Okay.

354
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.400
Gosh. I am just not--

355
00:15:29.533 --> 00:15:31.033
ugh. not myself today.

356
00:15:31.166 --> 00:15:33.800
Well. the island can have
a magical effect on people.

357
00:15:33.934 --> 00:15:36.834
It brings out the best in some
and the worst in others.

358
00:15:36.967 --> 00:15:39.066
It is not magic. okay?

359
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.266
It is desperation.

360
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.066
Can you please
just take me back to the harbor?

361
00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.233
As much as I would love
to part with your company

362
00:15:45.367 --> 00:15:48.166
as fast as humanly possible.
sadly. I cannot.

363
00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.633
We just left. it will take you
like five minutes to get back.

364
00:15:50.767 --> 00:15:52.900
Five minutes.
I don't have. grab the wheel.

365
00:15:53.033 --> 00:15:54.500
I'm headed to the other
side of the island.

366
00:15:54.633 --> 00:15:56.900
I can't get caught
between tides.

367
00:15:57.033 --> 00:16:00.767
Um. I have wedding obligations.

368
00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:02.400
And my family
is gonna be looking for me.

369
00:16:02.533 --> 00:16:04.066
Hey. should've thought of that
before you stowed away

370
00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.467
on a boat heading
the opposite direction.

371
00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.633
The bad news is they're gonna
have to get by without you.

372
00:16:09.767 --> 00:16:13.400
The good news is not much
can happen at a wedding
without the bride.

373
00:16:13.533 --> 00:16:14.867
Okay.

374
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.266
Uh. what makes you so sure
that I'm the bride?

375
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.700
You fit the profile.

376
00:16:17.834 --> 00:16:19.266
Okay.

377
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:20.734
All right.
And what's the profile?

378
00:16:20.867 --> 00:16:22.567
Oh. spoiled. entitled.

379
00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.400
doing what it takes
to get your way.

380
00:16:24.533 --> 00:16:27.033
Okay. Well. you know.
first of all. um.
I'm the maid of honor.

381
00:16:27.166 --> 00:16:28.967
And second of all.
my sister is the bride.

382
00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.633
Sounds like a real treat.

383
00:16:30.767 --> 00:16:33.633
You don't even know her
so just watch it.

384
00:16:33.767 --> 00:16:35.800
Yeah. I don't have to.
they're all the same.

385
00:16:35.934 --> 00:16:37.233
And. uh. maid of honor.
excuse me.

386
00:16:37.367 --> 00:16:38.533
is just a bride in training.

387
00:16:38.667 --> 00:16:39.967
Oh. really. okay.

388
00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.066
Says the. uh. off the grid.

389
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.867
free-spirit who's probably
never even come close
to being married.

390
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.734
Are you trying
to make me cry?

391
00:16:47.066 --> 00:16:49.567
Can you please just take me
back to the harbor?

392
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:50.734
You created this mess.

393
00:16:50.867 --> 00:16:52.300
it's not my problem.

394
00:16:52.433 --> 00:16:53.533
I'm not gonna have my day off

395
00:16:53.667 --> 00:16:54.934
high-jacked by some
overly demanding

396
00:16:55.066 --> 00:16:56.767
pirate bridesmaid.

397
00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.834
That's rule
number one actually.

398
00:16:59.734 --> 00:17:01.633
Okay. Fine. Fine.

399
00:17:01.767 --> 00:17:04.367
we will use this time
to discuss your rates
for finding my ring.

400
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.633
Rule number two.
no business talk aboard the Gem.

401
00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.800
Okay. Then let me at least
just show you a picture of it.

402
00:17:09.934 --> 00:17:12.200
Rule number three.
no cellphones.

403
00:17:12.333 --> 00:17:14.266
I'm sorry.
Give me my phone back.

404
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.867
Uh. either it goes in the safe
or it goes overboard.

405
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.333
You got to be kidding.

406
00:17:21.934 --> 00:17:24.166
Oh. get the wheel.
get the wheel.

407
00:17:24.834 --> 00:17:26.867
This cannot be happening.

408
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.300
You know.
people pay big bucks

409
00:17:28.433 --> 00:17:29.967
for a private sailboat ride

410
00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.734
by a skilled naval officer
such as myself.

411
00:17:34.467 --> 00:17:35.734
Move. please.

412
00:17:36.834 --> 00:17:37.967
All right. Fine.

413
00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:39.667
How much?

414
00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.967
- How much?
- How much what?

415
00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.533
How much is it
to charter your boat?

416
00:17:44.667 --> 00:17:47.166
I will pay your charter fee
for the rest of the day

417
00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:51.266
if you please. please
just take me back to the harbor.

418
00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:54.033
Indulge me. please.
please for you own benefit.

419
00:17:54.166 --> 00:17:56.333
just take a moment to appreciate
where you are. okay?

420
00:17:56.467 --> 00:17:58.867
That island over there
and the water around this

421
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.200
they're all living.
breathing entities.

422
00:18:00.333 --> 00:18:04.533
This boat headed into the wind
silently picking up speed.

423
00:18:04.667 --> 00:18:06.200
headed towards
the infinite horizon.

424
00:18:06.333 --> 00:18:09.367
all the joys of sailing
come to you in a rush

425
00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:12.567
setting you free from all
the troubles of the mainland.

426
00:18:14.667 --> 00:18:16.834
Oh. will you please
just take me back to the harbor?

427
00:18:16.967 --> 00:18:20.200
I already
told you. I cannot do that.

428
00:18:28.333 --> 00:18:29.467
Thank You.

429
00:18:31.567 --> 00:18:32.767
No text. no calls.

430
00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:34.266
It's not like
Addie to go off grid.

431
00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.100
It's too early
to get worried.

432
00:18:36.233 --> 00:18:37.333
The girl sleeps
with her phone under her pillow.

433
00:18:37.467 --> 00:18:39.867
Well. maybe she has bad service.

434
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.367
- Try her again. Mom.
- Okay.

435
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:43.533
I found her.

436
00:18:43.667 --> 00:18:45.800
- What?
- Oh.

437
00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.734
Hey. wait.
wait. wait. um.

438
00:18:53.867 --> 00:18:55.433
that's my resort can you. um.

439
00:18:55.567 --> 00:18:56.867
can you just take me to shore?

440
00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.900
This is as close
as I can get. Keep the jacket.

441
00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.767
You can safely swim
from here and get back

442
00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:03.867
to your beloved
wedding obligations.

443
00:19:04.633 --> 00:19:06.967
Oh. wait.
so you just want me

444
00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.767
to jump off
the side of a moving boat?

445
00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.867
Why not?
You had no trouble jumping on.

446
00:19:14.133 --> 00:19:15.533
Now or never.

447
00:19:27.133 --> 00:19:29.300
I'll see you tomorrow
morning bright and early.

448
00:19:29.433 --> 00:19:31.533
Dive Bungalow 7:00 AM.

449
00:19:43.633 --> 00:19:44.934
Oh. Addie.

450
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.867
Who's the hunky sailor man?

451
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.033
Hunky sailor?

452
00:19:51.166 --> 00:19:53.834
Please don't ask.

453
00:19:53.967 --> 00:19:56.133
Honey. are you taking
sailing lessons?

454
00:19:56.266 --> 00:19:57.734
No. I am not taking
sailing lessons.

455
00:19:57.867 --> 00:20:01.233
He is a dive instructor
who I went to talk you

456
00:20:01.367 --> 00:20:03.467
about helping me
find my ring.

457
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.734
How did you get
onto his boat?

458
00:20:04.867 --> 00:20:06.200
Long story.

459
00:20:06.333 --> 00:20:07.867
Honey.
this isn't like you. you know.

460
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.500
we've been worried.
we've been trying to reach you.

461
00:20:09.633 --> 00:20:13.400
Yeah. my phone--
ugh. it doesn't matter.

462
00:20:14.367 --> 00:20:15.967
I'm gonna go change.

463
00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:18.367
I will be back. Okay.

464
00:20:20.266 --> 00:20:21.400
Excuse me.

465
00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.066
What do you think?

466
00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.233
How hunky is the sailorman?

467
00:20:26.367 --> 00:20:28.567
See for yourself.

468
00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.066
- Oh.
- Fair.

469
00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.633
I mean. he's okay looking.

470
00:20:31.767 --> 00:20:34.000
Yeah. keep telling yourself
that Nate-dog.

471
00:20:34.133 --> 00:20:35.867
He looks like a Kennedy.

472
00:20:40.133 --> 00:20:42.667
All right. I'll
finish up here. Great job today.

473
00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.200
Thanks. You too.

474
00:20:44.333 --> 00:20:45.533
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

475
00:20:45.667 --> 00:20:46.834
Yeah. I'll see you tomorrow.

476
00:20:46.967 --> 00:20:49.600
Oh. um. hi. sorry. excuse me.

477
00:20:51.367 --> 00:20:53.500
Hi. sorry. um.
I recognize you.

478
00:20:53.633 --> 00:20:56.066
you're from. uh--
you're from Bios. right?

479
00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.834
Uh. Dr. Mazur I presume?

480
00:20:57.967 --> 00:21:00.233
Wow. I usually don't get
recognized outside

481
00:21:00.367 --> 00:21:02.367
of our facility or at
our facility.

482
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:03.767
- come to think of it.
- No. sorry.

483
00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.300
I'm just so excited.
I recognized you

484
00:21:05.433 --> 00:21:08.800
from your website.
Um. I'm Addie Watson.

485
00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:11.533
I'm staying at the hotel.
I used to study

486
00:21:11.667 --> 00:21:14.300
Marine Biology and. uh.
I was actually hoping

487
00:21:14.433 --> 00:21:16.066
to come tour
your facility this week

488
00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.400
to get a better sense
of what you guys are doing here.

489
00:21:18.533 --> 00:21:20.533
Sure.
Call my assistant.

490
00:21:20.667 --> 00:21:22.233
We'll be happy to set-up
a time for you to come

491
00:21:22.367 --> 00:21:23.800
in and tour the facility.

492
00:21:23.934 --> 00:21:25.400
Wait? Really?
Yep.

493
00:21:25.533 --> 00:21:27.300
Oh. my gosh thank you.
Thank you so much!

494
00:21:27.433 --> 00:21:28.633
Thank you.

495
00:21:36.333 --> 00:21:37.867
Good morning.

496
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.266
Good mornin'.

497
00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.800
I'll trade your life jacket
for a cell phone.

498
00:21:40.934 --> 00:21:43.567
Gladly. I had no idea
how to turn it off.

499
00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.633
The thing was squawking
all night long.

500
00:21:45.767 --> 00:21:47.800
Made me feel better
about not having one.

501
00:21:47.934 --> 00:21:49.433
How do people
get in touch with you?

502
00:21:49.567 --> 00:21:51.533
They leave a message
at the hotel.

503
00:21:51.667 --> 00:21:53.467
Oh. that is wildly inefficient.

504
00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:54.934
Well. you found me
without a problem

505
00:21:55.066 --> 00:21:58.367
so from my perspective.
system works just fine.

506
00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.467
Okay.
Look. I'm sorry

507
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:01.967
if we got off
on the wrong foot yesterday

508
00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.767
but I really do need
your help finding this ring.

509
00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.600
Hannah said that you were
the best and that you were

510
00:22:06.734 --> 00:22:08.967
a very reasonable negotiator.

511
00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:10.367
Did she now?

512
00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.200
Yeah. Oh...

513
00:22:12.333 --> 00:22:15.633
Uh. hold on one second
I just have to take this.

514
00:22:15.767 --> 00:22:18.467
Uh. Dear Watson.
this is Addie speaking.

515
00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.200
Okay. Shyla.
Shyla. what's going on?

516
00:22:20.333 --> 00:22:22.266
Is everything okay?

517
00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.600
Okay. So please tell me
that the company

518
00:22:23.734 --> 00:22:25.600
is not imploding on us.

519
00:22:25.734 --> 00:22:27.200
- Okay. hey. I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

520
00:22:27.333 --> 00:22:29.900
Okay. So tell me
what's happening?

521
00:22:31.166 --> 00:22:32.166
Okay.

522
00:22:32.967 --> 00:22:35.500
- Good morning. Jack.
- Good morning.

523
00:22:35.633 --> 00:22:37.633
I have an updated schedule
for today.

524
00:22:37.767 --> 00:22:38.667
Thank you.

525
00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.767
I see that Addie
was able to track you down.

526
00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:43.800
Hey. remind me of my rule about
telling guests where I live.

527
00:22:43.934 --> 00:22:46.767
She was so upset about her ring.
I didn't want it
to ruin her vacation.

528
00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:48.767
Yeah. better
to ruin my day. huh?

529
00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.500
I was only trying to help.
It seemed like a win-win.

530
00:22:51.633 --> 00:22:54.467
Help someone in need.
Earn funds for your trip.

531
00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.433
How thoughtful of you.

532
00:22:56.567 --> 00:22:58.867
I say this
with nothing but love.

533
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.166
I know you've been
through a lot.

534
00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:03.233
but you can't shut
the world out forever.

535
00:23:03.367 --> 00:23:04.500
I can try.

536
00:23:04.633 --> 00:23:06.166
But If there's a real emergency.

537
00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:08.200
still call me. don't call Kate.

538
00:23:08.333 --> 00:23:09.433
Okay. I'll talk to you soon.

539
00:23:09.567 --> 00:23:11.533
Bye.

540
00:23:11.667 --> 00:23:14.166
- Oh. Hannah. hi.
- Hi.

541
00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:15.600
I found Jack.

542
00:23:15.734 --> 00:23:18.066
I see that.
Good luck on your search.

543
00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.033
Thank you.

544
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.533
So what's Dear Watson?

545
00:23:24.667 --> 00:23:26.166
Uh.
it's my sister's company.

546
00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.667
Well. um.
our company sort of.

547
00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.367
Cool. What do you sell.
uh. magnifying glasses.

548
00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.233
wooden pipes. cool little hats?

549
00:23:34.633 --> 00:23:36.734
Elementary Dear Watson.

550
00:23:36.867 --> 00:23:39.767
Oh. my goodness.
I don't do accents.

551
00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:41.367
- Yeah. Yeah. Nice.
- Normally.

552
00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.266
Uh. no. no.
we. uh. we sell clothes.

553
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.767
Yeah. but good catch
on the reference.

554
00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.200
My dad is a very big
Sherlock Holmes fan

555
00:23:48.333 --> 00:23:50.367
and. uh. it's our last name.
so yeah.

556
00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:53.066
- Nice.
- Yeah.

557
00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.367
- Can we get this thing going?
- Ladies first.

558
00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:57.333
No I never speak first
in negotiations.

559
00:23:57.467 --> 00:23:59.166
Neither do I.

560
00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.633
So what do we do now?

561
00:24:02.767 --> 00:24:04.433
Uh. okay. How about
I start with showing you

562
00:24:04.567 --> 00:24:06.800
a picture of the ring.

563
00:24:06.934 --> 00:24:08.200
Sure.

564
00:24:09.567 --> 00:24:12.233
Oh. wow. Is that
a Golden South Sea Pearl?

565
00:24:12.367 --> 00:24:13.767
- Uh-hmm.
- What's it worth?

566
00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:17.600
Uh. I don't know actually.
Does it matter?

567
00:24:17.734 --> 00:24:19.233
I base my recovery fee
off a percentage

568
00:24:19.367 --> 00:24:22.567
of what the item is worth.
minimum 10. maximum of 30.

569
00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:24.433
If I find it quickly.
I charge less.

570
00:24:24.567 --> 00:24:26.233
It's proportional to my effort.
I only get paid

571
00:24:26.367 --> 00:24:28.133
if and when
I find your ring.

572
00:24:28.567 --> 00:24:30.166
Okay. Well. yeah.
Hannah said that

573
00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.333
you had a high recovery rate.

574
00:24:31.467 --> 00:24:32.433
I had to have
a discussion with Hannah

575
00:24:32.567 --> 00:24:35.767
about conversational boundaries.

576
00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:37.033
but. yeah.

577
00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.967
let's try this
from a different angle.

578
00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:41.800
What is it worth to you?

579
00:24:42.767 --> 00:24:46.834
I-- it's not an easy
question for me to answer.

580
00:24:46.967 --> 00:24:50.600
Well it. uh.
belonged to my grandma.

581
00:24:50.734 --> 00:24:52.333
so it's completely unique.

582
00:24:52.467 --> 00:24:56.767
My grandpa found the pearl
and he designed it himself.

583
00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:58.300
I don't know. no.
I would never dream

584
00:24:58.433 --> 00:24:59.500
putting an actual price
on it.

585
00:24:59.633 --> 00:25:01.133
It would--
it would just jinx it.

586
00:25:01.266 --> 00:25:02.834
Jinx what?

587
00:25:02.967 --> 00:25:05.400
Okay. This is gonna sound
really silly.

588
00:25:05.533 --> 00:25:07.133
I understand that.

589
00:25:07.266 --> 00:25:09.533
But my grandma believed
that the ring

590
00:25:09.667 --> 00:25:11.333
would bring me good luck.

591
00:25:11.467 --> 00:25:15.700
She went as far as to claim
that it has magical properties.

592
00:25:15.834 --> 00:25:17.767
Does it have
magical properties?

593
00:25:18.834 --> 00:25:21.734
I mean. um...

594
00:25:21.867 --> 00:25:24.867
Okay. The only thing
that I know for sure is...

595
00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.633
I love my grandma
more than words

596
00:25:28.767 --> 00:25:31.000
and she was a really.
really special person

597
00:25:31.133 --> 00:25:34.000
in my life. so...

598
00:25:34.133 --> 00:25:35.700
wearing her ring just...

599
00:25:35.834 --> 00:25:39.066
guarantees that she's
never far from my thoughts.

600
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.767
Sounds like magic to me.

601
00:25:44.633 --> 00:25:46.066
Okay. Look.
what if I give you

602
00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.333
a $2.000 guarantee
up front.

603
00:25:48.467 --> 00:25:50.900
and then a $2.000 bonus
for when you find the ring.

604
00:25:51.033 --> 00:25:53.066
I'd say that's
more than fair. Yeah.

605
00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.166
All right. I just need you
to be as motivated as possible.

606
00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:57.066
I mean. I'm only here
for a few days

607
00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.900
and it would kill me to leave
this island without it.

608
00:26:01.934 --> 00:26:04.033
That's a lot of pressure.

609
00:26:04.166 --> 00:26:06.033
You know I can't guarantee
I'm gonna find it. right?

610
00:26:06.166 --> 00:26:07.900
I know. I know. I just--
I need you to promise me

611
00:26:08.033 --> 00:26:10.667
that you're gonna try
your very. very. best. please?

612
00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.600
- Let's walk down the shoreline.
- Really? Thanks.

613
00:26:16.734 --> 00:26:20.000
See if we can get a rough idea
where you think you had it last.

614
00:26:23.867 --> 00:26:25.367
Uh. so. I don't know.

615
00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:27.233
I'm thinking that I lost it
somewhere in the middle.

616
00:26:27.367 --> 00:26:28.967
- And what time was that?
- I don't know for sure.

617
00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:30.834
I didn't even realize
that I lost it

618
00:26:30.967 --> 00:26:32.533
till we got back
on the beach but--

619
00:26:32.667 --> 00:26:34.333
I'm sorry. Did I hear
you say you lost something?

620
00:26:34.467 --> 00:26:35.834
- Nope.
- Yeah. I lost my ring.

621
00:26:35.967 --> 00:26:38.533
No. she-- it's all good.

622
00:26:38.667 --> 00:26:40.033
No. she said ring. right?

623
00:26:40.166 --> 00:26:42.133
No. she said. uh.
ain't no thing.

624
00:26:42.266 --> 00:26:44.000
Oh.

625
00:26:44.133 --> 00:26:45.734
Yeah. we're just enjoying
the view man. so...

626
00:26:45.867 --> 00:26:47.066
- All right.
- Yeah.

627
00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.333
Okay. Well. you guys take care.

628
00:26:49.467 --> 00:26:52.033
If you need my service.
my name is Doug.

629
00:26:52.166 --> 00:26:53.667
Doug Chamberlain.

630
00:26:54.066 --> 00:26:55.667
- Have a good one.
- Yeah. you too.

631
00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.033
Okay.

632
00:26:59.967 --> 00:27:01.600
Uh. okay.
What was that all about?

633
00:27:01.734 --> 00:27:03.066
Why didn't you tell him.
he could've helped us?

634
00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.600
Trust me.
he doesn't wanna help you.

635
00:27:05.734 --> 00:27:07.700
The last thing you want
is the word to get out

636
00:27:07.834 --> 00:27:08.934
that you lost something valuable.

637
00:27:09.066 --> 00:27:11.600
Beachcombers like Doug.
are real sharks.

638
00:27:11.734 --> 00:27:14.367
they smell a little blood
in the water and they swarm.

639
00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.967
Oh. Geez. Okay.
I never thought of it
like that.

640
00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:19.400
- We just got to be careful.
- Yeah.

641
00:27:19.533 --> 00:27:20.900
There's deep water
out there. plenty of reef.

642
00:27:21.033 --> 00:27:22.133
Lots of places
for your ring to hide.

643
00:27:22.266 --> 00:27:23.300
Yeah.

644
00:27:23.433 --> 00:27:24.967
With the tide
rolling in and out.

645
00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:26.400
there's no telling
which way it could've drifted.

646
00:27:26.533 --> 00:27:28.867
I have about a two-hour window
to dive each day

647
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.700
when I'm not obligated
to the resort.

648
00:27:30.834 --> 00:27:34.033
Uh. well.
how soon can you start?

649
00:27:34.166 --> 00:27:35.800
Today soon enough?

650
00:27:35.934 --> 00:27:36.967
Yeah.
That would be perfect.

651
00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:38.367
All right. We got a deal?

652
00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:39.633
One more thing.

653
00:27:39.767 --> 00:27:40.633
What's that?

654
00:27:40.767 --> 00:27:42.033
Well. when I'm available

655
00:27:42.166 --> 00:27:44.200
and not in the middle of my
sisterly duties.

656
00:27:44.333 --> 00:27:46.300
I wanna dive with you.

657
00:27:46.433 --> 00:27:49.233
- That's a deal-breaker.
- What? Why?

658
00:27:49.367 --> 00:27:51.967
I mean.
I just told you how important
this ring is to me.

659
00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:53.633
You really expect me
to sit on the shore

660
00:27:53.767 --> 00:27:55.066
and just do nothing?

661
00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.300
I'm highly skilled.
Former US Navy Diver.

662
00:27:57.433 --> 00:27:59.400
All you'll do
is slow me down.

663
00:27:59.533 --> 00:28:01.133
I couldn't even certify you
before it's time for you

664
00:28:01.266 --> 00:28:04.033
- to get on a flight.
- No. no. no. no.

665
00:28:04.166 --> 00:28:05.333
I am already certified.

666
00:28:05.467 --> 00:28:06.667
In fact.

667
00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:11.533
I am... a dive master.

668
00:28:14.934 --> 00:28:16.166
What do you need me for?

669
00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:17.834
You know the reef

670
00:28:17.967 --> 00:28:20.033
and we're gonna cover twice
as much ground together.

671
00:28:20.166 --> 00:28:22.533
You don't trust that
I can find it on my own. do you?

672
00:28:22.667 --> 00:28:25.934
Okay. Look. my sister
encouraged me to enjoy this trip

673
00:28:26.066 --> 00:28:28.367
and I really.
really enjoy diving.

674
00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:31.533
so. yeah. it might not be
the most ideal situation

675
00:28:31.667 --> 00:28:34.734
but I plan to take
full advantage of it.

676
00:28:35.533 --> 00:28:38.166
And you know what.
it gives me the perfect excuse

677
00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:39.667
to get back
into something that I love.

678
00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:43.367
that I've been away
from for far too long honestly.

679
00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:45.033
You might've led
with the dive master bit.

680
00:28:45.166 --> 00:28:46.300
Yeah. it's too much fun
watching you

681
00:28:46.433 --> 00:28:48.033
get all bent out of shape.

682
00:28:48.166 --> 00:28:50.100
Only time I can dive today
is right now.

683
00:28:50.233 --> 00:28:52.166
Perfect.
Let's do it!

684
00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:54.066
The sooner. the better.

685
00:28:59.266 --> 00:29:01.633
Where is he?

686
00:29:03.834 --> 00:29:05.934
I set the buoys.
Have you ever done

687
00:29:06.066 --> 00:29:07.934
a compass grid search?

688
00:29:08.066 --> 00:29:09.166
I understand the basics.

689
00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.667
but never done it before.

690
00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.166
All right.
it can get pretty murky down there

691
00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:13.667
when we start
moving things around.

692
00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:16.400
so the trick is to rely
on your metal detector.

693
00:29:16.533 --> 00:29:18.367
Uh. yeah. just follow my lead.

694
00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:19.700
Uh. you'll figure it out
pretty quick.

695
00:29:19.834 --> 00:29:21.533
We could be as strategic
as we want down there.

696
00:29:21.667 --> 00:29:23.433
but in the end.
the only way we find it.

697
00:29:23.567 --> 00:29:26.433
is that the ocean lets us
find it if we're sincere.

698
00:29:26.567 --> 00:29:30.100
respectful. you know.
we got a shot.

699
00:29:30.233 --> 00:29:33.166
All right.
I will. uh. do my best.

700
00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:34.433
Let's dive.

701
00:30:29.233 --> 00:30:31.066
- I got something.
- Really?

702
00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.233
Show it to me.
show it to me. show it to me.

703
00:30:33.367 --> 00:30:35.033
come on. come on. come on.

704
00:30:35.166 --> 00:30:37.567
Hope you got it.
I'm so damn excited.

705
00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:38.567
Hold on.

706
00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:40.333
Let me see. Let me see.

707
00:30:40.467 --> 00:30:42.266
What do you think. is that it?

708
00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.333
No. No. it's not it.

709
00:30:47.467 --> 00:30:49.400
Oh. no. it's not it.

710
00:30:50.266 --> 00:30:52.500
Oh. no. no. no. no!
Nothing to see here folks.

711
00:30:52.633 --> 00:30:54.166
- No.
- No. that's not it.

712
00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:56.266
- You keep moving on.
- No.

713
00:30:59.166 --> 00:31:01.100
Well.
we'll try again tomorrow.

714
00:31:01.233 --> 00:31:03.300
Yeah. Yup.

715
00:31:03.433 --> 00:31:05.000
Hey. what are you gonna do
with that ring?

716
00:31:05.133 --> 00:31:06.767
Uh. hand it off to Hannah.

717
00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:08.934
She'll reach out
to the resort guest list.

718
00:31:09.066 --> 00:31:10.867
See if we can find out
who lost it.

719
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.633
Well. I'm sure that the owner
will be thrilled to get it back.

720
00:31:14.767 --> 00:31:16.934
They probably thought
it was lost forever.

721
00:31:17.834 --> 00:31:21.500
You know. my dad taught me
to dive when I was a kid.

722
00:31:21.633 --> 00:31:23.333
There's this unwritten code
that you have to make

723
00:31:23.467 --> 00:31:26.300
every possible effort
to find the rightful owner.

724
00:31:26.433 --> 00:31:29.667
A lot of these things have
real meaning for one of them.

725
00:31:30.767 --> 00:31:34.867
My dad used to call them
the "Treasures of the Heart."

726
00:31:36.233 --> 00:31:37.800
I love that.

727
00:31:44.066 --> 00:31:45.667
Let's bring
the gear up. yeah?

728
00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.100
Yeah.

729
00:31:56.033 --> 00:31:59.300
These are places you've been?

730
00:31:59.433 --> 00:32:01.734
Oh. places
I'm. uh. headed to.

731
00:32:01.867 --> 00:32:05.467
I've been planning
a. uh. sail around the world.

732
00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:09.166
It's taking. uh.
a bit longer than I expected.

733
00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:11.300
- Life happens.
- Wow!

734
00:32:11.433 --> 00:32:13.066
You know. I was gonna do
something like this

735
00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.300
after I finished school.

736
00:32:14.433 --> 00:32:16.200
Why didn't you?

737
00:32:16.333 --> 00:32:18.233
Never finished school.

738
00:32:18.967 --> 00:32:21.066
Now I. uh.
put my plans on hold

739
00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.500
to help my sister
with the company.

740
00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:27.333
Hey. so. uh. only time
I have to dive tomorrow is.

741
00:32:27.467 --> 00:32:29.133
uh. bright and early. sunrise.

742
00:32:29.266 --> 00:32:31.133
If you're available?

743
00:32:31.266 --> 00:32:33.934
I will see you
bright and early.

744
00:32:43.834 --> 00:32:45.533
We're almost there. girls.

745
00:32:45.667 --> 00:32:49.000
Ugh. God. we need to
exercise when we get back home.

746
00:32:49.133 --> 00:32:52.000
- Oh. gosh.
- Guys. look at this view.

747
00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:54.800
This is so beautiful.

748
00:32:54.934 --> 00:32:56.567
Thank you. guys.

749
00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:59.300
- Oh my gosh. what a surprise.
- Thank you.

750
00:32:59.433 --> 00:33:03.433
- Wow.
- Thank you.

751
00:33:03.567 --> 00:33:05.133
Hey. Addie.
I'm sorry I meant to ask you.

752
00:33:05.266 --> 00:33:07.734
- How did the ring search go?
- Oh.

753
00:33:07.867 --> 00:33:09.633
Oh. uh. well.
we covered a lot of ground.

754
00:33:09.767 --> 00:33:11.433
but we came up empty-handed.

755
00:33:11.567 --> 00:33:13.300
So we're gonna go diving again
first thing in the morning.

756
00:33:13.433 --> 00:33:15.567
I still can't believe
you're a certified dive master.

757
00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.133
- Yeah.
- Yes. It's like a...

758
00:33:18.266 --> 00:33:20.266
you know.
a relic from a previous life.

759
00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:23.533
If you could dive on your own.
why do you need
the hunky sailorman?

760
00:33:23.667 --> 00:33:24.900
Oh. yeah.
that is a great question.

761
00:33:25.033 --> 00:33:26.467
Well. first of all.
his name is Jack

762
00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:29.066
and he asked me
the same question.

763
00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.200
He. you know.
he knows the bay.

764
00:33:31.333 --> 00:33:32.800
And he'd have
some recovery experience.

765
00:33:32.934 --> 00:33:34.767
- Hmm.
- Uh-hmm.

766
00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:36.233
- I'm not buying it.
- Uh-uh.

767
00:33:36.367 --> 00:33:38.367
Oh. Kate. please.
It's simple math. you guys.

768
00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:40.300
We covered twice
as much ground together.

769
00:33:40.433 --> 00:33:41.734
- Addie...
- Hmm.

770
00:33:41.867 --> 00:33:43.166
...do you like this guy?

771
00:33:44.033 --> 00:33:45.633
Okay. If you met him.
you would know

772
00:33:45.767 --> 00:33:47.533
that makes absolutely no sense.

773
00:33:47.667 --> 00:33:50.266
Well. jumping off a dock
onto a moving sailboat

774
00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:51.567
- doesn't make much sense either.
- Uh-hmm.

775
00:33:52.166 --> 00:33:55.367
Okay. Everything that he does
and the way that he does it

776
00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:58.033
just gets under my skin.

777
00:33:58.166 --> 00:34:01.266
I don't know. But then again.
if I'm being honest--

778
00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.300
- There's a "But."
- Hmm. Uh-hmm.

779
00:34:04.433 --> 00:34:06.300
I don't know. He...

780
00:34:06.433 --> 00:34:08.767
He said something before
that made him seem

781
00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:12.133
remotely endearing.
about his dad.

782
00:34:12.266 --> 00:34:14.033
but he lives on a sailboat.
okay?

783
00:34:14.166 --> 00:34:16.934
He can just pack up and vanish
in a moment's notice. Nope.

784
00:34:17.066 --> 00:34:19.433
He sounds like a romantic.

785
00:34:19.567 --> 00:34:21.000
Or like someone
who just doesn't wanna grow up.

786
00:34:21.133 --> 00:34:23.900
Or like someone who's willing
to follow the magic.

787
00:34:24.667 --> 00:34:26.633
Okay.
Now. you sound like Grandma.

788
00:34:27.767 --> 00:34:29.133
Follow the magic?

789
00:34:29.266 --> 00:34:30.800
Our grandma was a big believer

790
00:34:30.934 --> 00:34:32.133
- in reading the signs.
- Uh-hmm.

791
00:34:32.266 --> 00:34:34.033
You know.
finding the magic

792
00:34:34.166 --> 00:34:35.467
and meaning in everything.

793
00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.266
Aw. That's so sweet.

794
00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.867
Yeah.
Well. despite her best efforts.

795
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.200
Addie here
has remained a skeptic

796
00:34:40.333 --> 00:34:42.433
in regards
to all things magical.

797
00:34:42.567 --> 00:34:45.934
I like facts and logic.

798
00:34:46.066 --> 00:34:47.166
Things that I can wrap
my head around.

799
00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:49.700
Things that just make sense.

800
00:34:49.834 --> 00:34:51.667
Yeah. When she turned eight.
Addie refused to make a wish

801
00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.800
before blowing out the candles
on her birthday cake.

802
00:34:54.934 --> 00:34:55.967
Tell me that's not true!

803
00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:57.600
I don't believe
in placing my faith

804
00:34:57.734 --> 00:35:00.266
in irrational superstitions.

805
00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.734
Look. I would love nothing more
than to believe like Grandma.

806
00:35:03.867 --> 00:35:06.834
but nothing in my life has.

807
00:35:06.967 --> 00:35:09.700
you know. led me to believe.

808
00:35:09.834 --> 00:35:11.500
Well. she's no longer
with us.

809
00:35:11.633 --> 00:35:13.100
but I think she may be getting
the last laugh on this one.

810
00:35:13.233 --> 00:35:15.266
Hey. to Grandma!

811
00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.000
Still setting up
her granddaughters

812
00:35:17.133 --> 00:35:18.533
- from beyond the veil.
- Yes!

813
00:35:18.667 --> 00:35:19.767
I'll drink to that.

814
00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:21.533
Uh-uh. yeah. no. no.

815
00:35:21.667 --> 00:35:22.533
- Cheers.
- Come on.

816
00:35:22.667 --> 00:35:24.266
No.

817
00:35:29.233 --> 00:35:31.400
Welcome to the main event.

818
00:35:31.533 --> 00:35:33.934
The bride
and the bridesmaids

819
00:35:34.066 --> 00:35:36.033
versus the groom
and the groomsmen

820
00:35:36.166 --> 00:35:38.100
in the Photo Scavenger Hunt.

821
00:35:38.233 --> 00:35:40.033
Woo! What are
we competing for?

822
00:35:40.166 --> 00:35:42.767
Bragging rights
that last till death do you part

823
00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:46.266
and a hundred dollar gift card
for each team member.

824
00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:49.333
There are five items
on the list.

825
00:35:49.467 --> 00:35:51.200
Your mission
is to be the first team back

826
00:35:51.333 --> 00:35:55.867
along with a group photo
with three of the five items.

827
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.400
Oh.
Oh. we got you beat.

828
00:35:57.533 --> 00:35:58.533
You're going down.

829
00:35:58.667 --> 00:36:00.166
Oh. we'll see about that.

830
00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:01.600
Oh. yes. we will.

831
00:36:01.734 --> 00:36:03.900
Ready. set. go!

832
00:36:04.033 --> 00:36:05.467
- Okay.
- Okay. okay.

833
00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.266
Uh. "Strike the bell.
the gong will sing.

834
00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:09.166
And peace of mind. the sound
will bring." All right.

835
00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:10.900
Okay.
"By light of the moon

836
00:36:11.033 --> 00:36:13.734
and oft by fate. make a wish
by this twisted gate."

837
00:36:13.867 --> 00:36:15.967
- Three. two. one. break.
- Twisted gate.

838
00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:17.834
Okay. So...

839
00:36:17.967 --> 00:36:19.166
What?
Uh. it's like a...

840
00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:21.834
Something like a--
like at nighttime...

841
00:36:21.967 --> 00:36:24.333
Hi! Hi.

842
00:36:24.467 --> 00:36:25.767
It's. um. it's Jack. right?

843
00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:27.734
Uh. yes. I am.

844
00:36:27.867 --> 00:36:29.800
You must be
the. uh. bride to be?

845
00:36:29.934 --> 00:36:31.400
Yes. I'm Kate.

846
00:36:31.533 --> 00:36:33.166
Addie's sister.
This is our good friend Kara.

847
00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:34.667
Thanks for bringing Addie
in one piece yesterday.

848
00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.266
Yeah. you're welcome.

849
00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.467
So. we were sent
on a scavenger hunt

850
00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:40.633
by the resort.
Do you know the island well?

851
00:36:40.767 --> 00:36:42.433
- I do.
- Hmm.

852
00:36:42.567 --> 00:36:44.667
Would you like
to play tour guide?

853
00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.000
Oh. no.

854
00:36:46.133 --> 00:36:47.967
I am sure
that Jack is far too busy

855
00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:49.734
to chauffeur us
around the island. so.

856
00:36:49.867 --> 00:36:52.633
As luck would have it
my. uh. next dive
just canceled.

857
00:36:52.767 --> 00:36:54.166
so technically I'm free.

858
00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:56.066
Terrific!

859
00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.600
But I should probably
use that time

860
00:36:57.734 --> 00:36:58.834
to dive for Addie's ring.

861
00:36:58.967 --> 00:37:00.834
Yes. yes. you should.

862
00:37:00.967 --> 00:37:02.166
So I'm sorry. ladies.

863
00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:04.400
But Jack is technically
on the clock.

864
00:37:04.533 --> 00:37:06.000
Yeah. Technically.
that's true.

865
00:37:06.133 --> 00:37:07.567
But. um. you forgot
about this.

866
00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:10.967
Sorry. Jack. I'm pulling
the bride card on this one.

867
00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:12.567
Looks pretty legit.

868
00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:13.667
Oh. it's platinum level.

869
00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.400
Yeah. you're coming
with us.

870
00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:19.233
What are you doing?

871
00:37:19.367 --> 00:37:20.667
What? You gave it to me.

872
00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.633
Oh. yeah. No. I know.
I just didn't expect you

873
00:37:22.767 --> 00:37:23.967
to use it against me.

874
00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:25.667
I am well within
my bridal privileges.

875
00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.066
Oh. I know.

876
00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:28.700
I just feel like
this is something else.

877
00:37:28.834 --> 00:37:30.500
I'm just trying to figure out
what you're trying to do.

878
00:37:30.633 --> 00:37:33.433
I am trying
to win a scavenger hunt.

879
00:37:36.934 --> 00:37:38.033
Okay. All right.

880
00:37:38.166 --> 00:37:39.867
I will. uh.
I will call us a ride.

881
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.734
We can take my Jeep
if you want.

882
00:37:41.867 --> 00:37:43.033
Oh. even better.

883
00:37:45.166 --> 00:37:46.834
Yeah.

884
00:37:46.967 --> 00:37:48.166
Of course. he has a jeep.

885
00:37:55.667 --> 00:37:58.066
"By light of the moon
and oft by fate.

886
00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.266
just make a wish
by this twisted gate."

887
00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.433
It's the Moongate.
I'm telling you.

888
00:38:03.266 --> 00:38:05.834
Okay.
I guess we'll see.

889
00:38:11.934 --> 00:38:14.800
Oh. the boys
are never gonna find this.

890
00:38:14.934 --> 00:38:15.934
You're welcome.

891
00:38:16.066 --> 00:38:17.834
Okay. Here.
Take a picture.

892
00:38:20.066 --> 00:38:22.567
Okay.

893
00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:23.633
Pose.

894
00:38:23.767 --> 00:38:25.033
- Oh. yeah.
- All right. Awesome.

895
00:38:25.166 --> 00:38:26.066
Now. let's get
on the next clue!

896
00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:27.467
Oh. hold on. Hold on.

897
00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:28.767
We have to make a wish first.

898
00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:29.800
Hmm?

899
00:38:29.934 --> 00:38:31.467
You can't pass a moon door

900
00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:32.767
without walking through
and making a wish first.

901
00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:33.934
What is this. amateur hour?

902
00:38:34.066 --> 00:38:35.233
Oops. sorry. okay.

903
00:38:35.367 --> 00:38:37.800
Oh. I love that.

904
00:38:40.734 --> 00:38:43.233
Uh. you should make a wish
to find your ring.

905
00:38:43.367 --> 00:38:45.133
Oh. isn't that
what I hired you for?

906
00:38:45.266 --> 00:38:46.734
I can use
all the help I can get.

907
00:38:46.867 --> 00:38:50.633
Oh. um. Addie doesn't believe
in making wishes.

908
00:38:50.767 --> 00:38:52.266
Why not?

909
00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.100
Well. I just. you know.

910
00:38:54.233 --> 00:38:56.133
I think you're just setting
yourself up for disappointment

911
00:38:56.266 --> 00:38:57.533
- when they don't come true.
- Okay.

912
00:38:57.667 --> 00:38:59.633
You're kind of missing
the point.

913
00:38:59.767 --> 00:39:01.467
Really?
Now. what would that be?

914
00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.033
Positive energy.
good vibes. karma.

915
00:39:04.166 --> 00:39:05.300
good old-fashioned hope.

916
00:39:05.433 --> 00:39:07.533
that's what
a wish is all about.

917
00:39:07.667 --> 00:39:09.400
Without hope.

918
00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:11.667
you got no chance at all.

919
00:39:15.266 --> 00:39:16.834
Okay. fine.

920
00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.033
How did you come
to live in Hawaii. Jack?

921
00:39:43.166 --> 00:39:44.467
Well. my parents
honeymooned here

922
00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:46.066
and they loved it so much.

923
00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.066
they would visit
every single year.

924
00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:49.567
All of my favorite memories

925
00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:51.934
are from right here
on this island.

926
00:39:52.066 --> 00:39:53.767
So...

927
00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:54.934
are you single?

928
00:39:55.066 --> 00:39:56.200
Kara!

929
00:39:56.333 --> 00:39:58.967
I am.

930
00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.734
May I ask why?

931
00:40:00.867 --> 00:40:02.533
Why does this feel
like a job interview?

932
00:40:02.667 --> 00:40:04.467
Seriously.
What's the problem?

933
00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.133
Problem. I mean--

934
00:40:06.266 --> 00:40:07.300
all right. fine.

935
00:40:07.433 --> 00:40:09.266
To answer your question.

936
00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.533
I don't know.

937
00:40:10.667 --> 00:40:12.967
I tend to size people up
very quickly

938
00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:15.400
and see who they are
underneath the surface.

939
00:40:15.533 --> 00:40:17.033
I don't like to waste my time
if I know

940
00:40:17.166 --> 00:40:18.767
something doesn't have a chance
of working out.

941
00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:20.767
I know exactly
what you mean.

942
00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:22.533
Oh. well.

943
00:40:22.667 --> 00:40:25.367
at least you two
have one thing in common.

944
00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:27.367
"Strike the bell.
the gong will sing.

945
00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:29.567
And peace of mind.
the sound will bring."

946
00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:32.033
Now. this is a ritual
I can get behind.

947
00:40:32.166 --> 00:40:34.066
Okay.

948
00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.000
Woo!

949
00:40:36.633 --> 00:40:38.700
All right. Pose.

950
00:40:38.834 --> 00:40:40.967
All right. Smile!

951
00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:42.400
Okay. Next clue.

952
00:40:42.533 --> 00:40:44.200
"You're almost done.
you're on the brink.

953
00:40:44.333 --> 00:40:46.867
so snap a pic
with a spiny drink."

954
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.133
Spiny drink.

955
00:40:48.266 --> 00:40:49.467
Spiny drink.

956
00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.467
Who made these?

957
00:40:51.967 --> 00:40:54.333
You know
I know it. right?

958
00:41:06.133 --> 00:41:07.100
Hmm. Did we win?

959
00:41:07.233 --> 00:41:08.300
Absolutely!

960
00:41:08.433 --> 00:41:09.633
Yes!

961
00:41:09.767 --> 00:41:11.133
Mainly because
the groomsmen gave up

962
00:41:11.266 --> 00:41:12.867
and decided to go play golf.

963
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.100
Those stinkers!

964
00:41:14.233 --> 00:41:15.433
Still. we had a great time

965
00:41:15.567 --> 00:41:16.834
with a really great tour guide.

966
00:41:16.967 --> 00:41:19.934
Yes. thanks. Jack.
it was a lovely afternoon.

967
00:41:20.066 --> 00:41:21.100
The pleasure was all mine.

968
00:41:21.233 --> 00:41:22.300
Can I borrow you
for a minute?

969
00:41:22.433 --> 00:41:23.967
Scheduling question.

970
00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:25.667
Excuse me.

971
00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:28.867
You should go
on a date with him.

972
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.767
No. Huh. No.

973
00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:32.800
He's helping me find my ring.
That is it.

974
00:41:32.934 --> 00:41:34.600
Okay. He got you.
the most skeptical woman

975
00:41:34.734 --> 00:41:36.333
on the planet.
to make an actual wish.

976
00:41:36.467 --> 00:41:37.500
It's kind of epic.

977
00:41:37.633 --> 00:41:38.867
I was just being a good sport.

978
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.433
Okay. Trust me.
It was a lot easier

979
00:41:40.567 --> 00:41:41.867
than getting
into a philosophical

980
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.767
argument about
irrational beliefs.

981
00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:45.200
Well. maybe you should
start an argument

982
00:41:45.333 --> 00:41:47.033
over dinner and wine.

983
00:41:47.166 --> 00:41:49.333
Guys. what time would
I even have to go out with him?

984
00:41:49.467 --> 00:41:51.667
If I'm not out
searching for my ring.

985
00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:54.867
I am taking care
of wedding duties.

986
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.367
The wedding.
Now. there is an idea.

987
00:41:58.500 --> 00:41:59.800
- Jack.
- No. no. no. no. Wait.

988
00:41:59.934 --> 00:42:01.767
- Jack! Jack!
- No. What are you doing?

989
00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:03.734
I'm making time.

990
00:42:03.867 --> 00:42:05.867
So. you know. we.
we enjoyed your company

991
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.033
so much this afternoon.

992
00:42:07.166 --> 00:42:08.367
I would be honored

993
00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:10.567
if you would be a guest
at my wedding.

994
00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.533
Oh. whoa.

995
00:42:12.667 --> 00:42:13.500
you know.
good luck getting Jack

996
00:42:13.633 --> 00:42:14.667
to attend the wedding

997
00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:15.867
because he hates them.

998
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.266
Spoiled brides

999
00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:19.367
and blah. blah. blah.
am I right?

1000
00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:20.533
I would be honored.

1001
00:42:20.667 --> 00:42:22.367
Far be it
for me to deny

1002
00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.367
a bride's request
during her wedding week.

1003
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:26.066
Exactly. Thank you.

1004
00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:27.567
- That would be bad luck.
- And you didn't even make me

1005
00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:29.367
pull out
the bride card again.

1006
00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:31.734
- I appreciate that.
- Yeah. My pleasure.

1007
00:42:31.867 --> 00:42:33.533
Well. I guess
it will be my pleasure

1008
00:42:33.667 --> 00:42:35.033
to make sure
that there's room for you

1009
00:42:35.166 --> 00:42:37.734
at one of the already
very. very packed tables.

1010
00:42:37.867 --> 00:42:39.400
Oh. I'll be fine
at the misfit table.

1011
00:42:39.533 --> 00:42:41.433
Every wedding has got one
and to be honest.

1012
00:42:41.567 --> 00:42:43.033
that's where I fit
in best. so.

1013
00:42:43.166 --> 00:42:44.100
See you in the morning.

1014
00:42:44.233 --> 00:42:45.433
Yeah.

1015
00:42:45.567 --> 00:42:46.667
Okay.

1016
00:42:48.467 --> 00:42:49.734
Shh. What are you doing?
Stop. you guys.

1017
00:42:49.867 --> 00:42:51.867
You're acting like
we're back in high school.

1018
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.266
Stop it.

1019
00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:54.700
The fact
that you're trying so hard

1020
00:42:54.834 --> 00:42:56.166
not to like this guy
only confirms

1021
00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:58.166
- that you really like this guy.
- Uh-uh.

1022
00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:01.000
From what I can tell.
he likes you. too.

1023
00:43:01.133 --> 00:43:02.900
Jack can be many things.

1024
00:43:03.033 --> 00:43:04.333
but I've known him
long enough to know.

1025
00:43:04.467 --> 00:43:07.000
he's a really good guy.

1026
00:43:07.133 --> 00:43:08.700
But you didn't hear
that from me.

1027
00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:13.100
Also your Great-Uncle Newt
called from Florida.

1028
00:43:13.233 --> 00:43:16.100
His cat. Mr. Coconut.
isn't feeling well.

1029
00:43:16.233 --> 00:43:20.834
so there will be plenty of room
at the misfit table.

1030
00:43:20.967 --> 00:43:22.100
His words.

1031
00:43:22.233 --> 00:43:23.500
See?

1032
00:43:23.633 --> 00:43:25.567
Come on. Hannah has all
the details covered.

1033
00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:28.900
Hey. one day left
until the wedding.

1034
00:43:29.033 --> 00:43:30.700
why not make it count?

1035
00:44:04.867 --> 00:44:06.867
I think I owe you
an apology.

1036
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.333
What for?
I'm the one who hasn't found
your ring yet.

1037
00:44:10.467 --> 00:44:11.734
No. For the. uh...

1038
00:44:11.867 --> 00:44:13.400
the grilling
that Kate and Kara gave you.

1039
00:44:13.533 --> 00:44:14.633
Uh. it's only fair

1040
00:44:14.767 --> 00:44:16.767
that I get to return
the grilling.

1041
00:44:17.667 --> 00:44:18.734
Yeah. no. that's fair.

1042
00:44:18.867 --> 00:44:20.066
- That's fair.
- Uh-hmm.

1043
00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.066
All right.

1044
00:44:24.834 --> 00:44:26.767
Why are you single?

1045
00:44:27.367 --> 00:44:28.300
Oh. wow.

1046
00:44:28.433 --> 00:44:29.633
That really is the worst.

1047
00:44:29.767 --> 00:44:30.900
Okay.

1048
00:44:31.033 --> 00:44:35.133
Hey. what makes you
so sure I am?

1049
00:44:35.266 --> 00:44:37.233
- I don't know.
- What is that supposed to mean?

1050
00:44:37.367 --> 00:44:40.166
Look. if you're not comfortable.
you don't have to answer it.

1051
00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:42.567
No. no. it's fine.

1052
00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:46.667
Uh. okay.

1053
00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:49.300
Um. no.
A couple of years ago.
I. uh...

1054
00:44:49.433 --> 00:44:51.066
I went through a really.

1055
00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:55.834
what at the time felt like
an earth-shattering breakup.

1056
00:44:55.967 --> 00:44:58.633
Um. I thought I met
the man I was gonna marry

1057
00:44:58.767 --> 00:45:00.300
and he did wanna get married.

1058
00:45:00.433 --> 00:45:02.967
Just not to me.

1059
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.066
Hey. definitely his loss.

1060
00:45:08.433 --> 00:45:09.533
Well. to make me feel better.

1061
00:45:09.667 --> 00:45:12.767
my. uh. my grandma
gave me her ring.

1062
00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:15.133
She said it would bring me
nothing but good luck.

1063
00:45:15.266 --> 00:45:16.867
- Ah.
- Uh-hmm.

1064
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.400
So after that.
I told myself

1065
00:45:18.533 --> 00:45:21.567
that I would never
let anyone be

1066
00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:23.100
careless
with my heart again.

1067
00:45:23.667 --> 00:45:25.066
And I don't know.
ever since then.

1068
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.734
I just feel like
I haven't met anybody

1069
00:45:26.867 --> 00:45:28.800
who's made me feel
the way that I wanna feel

1070
00:45:28.934 --> 00:45:31.367
or at least the way
that I think you should feel

1071
00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:34.000
to take things
to the next level.

1072
00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:36.734
I think we're all
just hoping

1073
00:45:36.867 --> 00:45:38.734
to find someone
we're comfortable enough

1074
00:45:38.867 --> 00:45:40.767
to be ourselves around.

1075
00:45:43.533 --> 00:45:46.100
You're pretty easy
to talk to.

1076
00:45:46.734 --> 00:45:49.633
Yeah. I try
to be a good listener.

1077
00:45:52.367 --> 00:45:53.800
For the record.

1078
00:45:53.934 --> 00:45:55.200
if you don't want me
at your sister's wedding.

1079
00:45:55.333 --> 00:45:56.233
I won't go.

1080
00:45:56.367 --> 00:45:57.400
Oh. hey. no.

1081
00:45:57.533 --> 00:45:59.400
That deal was made exclusively

1082
00:45:59.533 --> 00:46:01.133
between you
and the bride-to-be.

1083
00:46:01.266 --> 00:46:02.700
I have absolutely no say

1084
00:46:02.834 --> 00:46:04.834
or stake in the matter. frankly.

1085
00:46:04.967 --> 00:46:07.400
- I don't care.
- Now that that's settled.

1086
00:46:12.667 --> 00:46:14.800
We covered
a lot of ground today.

1087
00:46:14.934 --> 00:46:16.867
I feel like
we're getting closer.

1088
00:46:18.433 --> 00:46:19.767
Yeah.

1089
00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:22.500
Yeah. I feel like we're. uh.
we're getting closer. too.

1090
00:46:27.633 --> 00:46:30.333
Well. uh...

1091
00:46:30.467 --> 00:46:31.467
yeah. I better get going.

1092
00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:32.934
I have some errands to run

1093
00:46:33.066 --> 00:46:35.033
and a lunch date to get to.

1094
00:46:35.166 --> 00:46:36.333
Oh. really?

1095
00:46:36.467 --> 00:46:40.166
Like a--like a date-date?

1096
00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:44.133
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

1097
00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:04.266
Hi. uh. this is--
this is Addie Watson.

1098
00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:06.700
Dr. Mazur told me
to call this number

1099
00:47:06.834 --> 00:47:08.500
to set up a tour
of your facility.

1100
00:47:09.934 --> 00:47:11.367
Yeah. um. the thing is.

1101
00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:13.567
I'm only on the island
for a couple of days.

1102
00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:16.867
Really?

1103
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.333
This afternoon?

1104
00:47:19.166 --> 00:47:20.367
Yeah. no. I can do that.

1105
00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:22.367
I could definitely
make that work.

1106
00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:25.367
That's perfect.
Thank you so much.

1107
00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:27.233
Okay. Bye.

1108
00:47:42.767 --> 00:47:44.667
You know. I didn't
expect the head of the program

1109
00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:46.166
to act as my personal
tour guide.

1110
00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:47.800
I'm always eager to chat
with anyone

1111
00:47:47.934 --> 00:47:49.467
who shows interest
in our work.

1112
00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:51.667
You know. I read
the study that you published

1113
00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:53.166
on the Sea Urchin
Cancer Research

1114
00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:54.967
and I thought
it was fantastic.

1115
00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:56.633
Wow. You did your homework.

1116
00:47:56.767 --> 00:47:59.266
Oh. my gosh.

1117
00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:01.667
I desperately wanna go back
to working in the water.

1118
00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:04.100
You know. the quickest way
for you to get back into it

1119
00:48:04.233 --> 00:48:06.266
is through
our summer program.

1120
00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:08.233
What area are you
most interested in?

1121
00:48:08.367 --> 00:48:12.000
Well. I interned
with a Marine Animal Rescue Team

1122
00:48:12.133 --> 00:48:13.367
when I was back in school.

1123
00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:15.033
And it was the best job
I've ever had.

1124
00:48:15.166 --> 00:48:16.600
Although it never
really felt like a job.

1125
00:48:16.734 --> 00:48:18.033
to be honest with you.

1126
00:48:18.166 --> 00:48:20.166
That's the real dream. right?
Do what you love

1127
00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:22.600
and you'll never work
a day in your life.

1128
00:48:22.734 --> 00:48:24.600
Uh-hmm. Some wise words.

1129
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:26.934
It's feeding time.

1130
00:48:27.066 --> 00:48:28.567
Would you like to join

1131
00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:30.867
some of our local
residents for lunch?

1132
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.367
Uh. yeah.

1133
00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:34.100
- Yeah. I would love to.
- Okay.

1134
00:48:34.233 --> 00:48:35.433
Let's get you suited up.

1135
00:48:35.567 --> 00:48:37.266
- Wait. Really?
- Yeah. You're certified

1136
00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:39.333
and Jack will keep you
safe in there.
Jack?

1137
00:48:39.467 --> 00:48:42.934
Of course. you know Jack. Hi.

1138
00:49:02.066 --> 00:49:03.500
- Woo!
- Oh. my gosh.

1139
00:49:03.633 --> 00:49:05.500
That was so much fun.

1140
00:49:05.633 --> 00:49:06.834
You were great.

1141
00:49:06.967 --> 00:49:08.333
- Thanks.
- That was awesome.

1142
00:49:08.467 --> 00:49:10.934
- A little pro down there.
- Yeah.

1143
00:49:11.066 --> 00:49:12.500
- Oh. okay.
- Yeah.

1144
00:49:12.633 --> 00:49:15.934
- So this was your lunch date?
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

1145
00:49:16.066 --> 00:49:18.000
- Busted.
- Uh-huh.

1146
00:49:18.133 --> 00:49:19.633
So what are you doing here?

1147
00:49:19.767 --> 00:49:21.166
Uh. just. you know.

1148
00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:23.500
- taking a--taking a tour.
- Yeah?

1149
00:49:23.633 --> 00:49:25.000
- Yeah.
- Nice.

1150
00:49:25.133 --> 00:49:27.000
- Uh. is it a wedding thing?
- No. no.

1151
00:49:27.133 --> 00:49:28.433
it's just a--
it's just a me thing actually.

1152
00:49:28.567 --> 00:49:30.934
Kate wanted me
to make some time for myself

1153
00:49:31.066 --> 00:49:32.266
while I was out here.

1154
00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:34.000
Actually.
I was studying Marine Biology

1155
00:49:34.133 --> 00:49:35.166
when I left school.

1156
00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:36.800
And lately. I don't know.

1157
00:49:36.934 --> 00:49:38.934
I've been thinking
about getting back into it.

1158
00:49:39.066 --> 00:49:41.433
Yeah. this is
the first use I've had
to reconnect with this world.

1159
00:49:41.567 --> 00:49:42.934
Well. let this be
a splash course

1160
00:49:43.066 --> 00:49:45.400
to get you back in the game.

1161
00:49:45.533 --> 00:49:47.500
Oh. man. That sounded
way better in my head.

1162
00:49:47.633 --> 00:49:48.967
Um. I'm hungry.

1163
00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:50.834
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah.

1164
00:49:50.967 --> 00:49:52.467
Yeah. I could eat.

1165
00:49:58.867 --> 00:50:00.000
- Oh.
- Oh.

1166
00:50:00.133 --> 00:50:01.467
- Mahalo.
- Mahalo.

1167
00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:03.000
Uh. very good.
Thank you very much. Mahalo.

1168
00:50:03.133 --> 00:50:04.266
- Hmm.
- So this is

1169
00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:05.900
the best pulled pork
on the island.

1170
00:50:06.033 --> 00:50:07.433
- Oh. really?
- Yeah. I would know.

1171
00:50:07.567 --> 00:50:09.934
I've been to every barbecue
joint on the island.

1172
00:50:10.066 --> 00:50:12.100
- That's impressive.
- It is.

1173
00:50:12.233 --> 00:50:13.800
Okay. So if that's the best
pulled pork.

1174
00:50:13.934 --> 00:50:15.800
that means that this has got
to be the best mac salad. right?

1175
00:50:15.934 --> 00:50:17.100
- Oh. hands down.
- Yeah?

1176
00:50:17.233 --> 00:50:18.734
- Yeah.
- All right. Woo.

1177
00:50:18.867 --> 00:50:19.900
Okay.

1178
00:50:20.033 --> 00:50:20.934
I'm excited for it.

1179
00:50:21.066 --> 00:50:22.600
Are you ready? Okay.

1180
00:50:22.734 --> 00:50:23.633
Yeah. Moment of truth.

1181
00:50:23.767 --> 00:50:25.200
Moment of truth.

1182
00:50:26.233 --> 00:50:27.800
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1183
00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:31.834
- Oh. my God.
- Right? Isn't that incredible?

1184
00:50:31.967 --> 00:50:33.333
That's so good.

1185
00:50:33.467 --> 00:50:34.834
- Can we come here every day?
- Every day.

1186
00:50:34.967 --> 00:50:36.166
- Isn't it amazing?
- Uh-hmm.

1187
00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:37.467
- It's the best.
- Okay. So I might

1188
00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:38.767
- just take...
- Get in there.

1189
00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:39.934
All right.

1190
00:50:40.066 --> 00:50:42.100
Best in the world. right?

1191
00:50:43.433 --> 00:50:45.266
Hey. So how serious
are you about

1192
00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:47.600
joining the summer program
at the aquarium?

1193
00:50:47.734 --> 00:50:49.100
Well. if it was up to me.

1194
00:50:49.233 --> 00:50:51.133
I'd say a hundred percent.

1195
00:50:51.266 --> 00:50:53.133
Who else is it up to exactly?

1196
00:50:53.934 --> 00:50:55.233
I mean.
there's a lot of factors.

1197
00:50:55.367 --> 00:50:57.934
You know.
there's. uh. the company.

1198
00:50:58.066 --> 00:50:59.133
my family.

1199
00:50:59.266 --> 00:51:01.166
and not to mention
my own head and heart.

1200
00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:05.066
which are very much at odds
at the moment.

1201
00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:07.533
Huh.
What's your biggest concern?

1202
00:51:07.667 --> 00:51:11.967
Well. everyone kind of
depends on me for everything.

1203
00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:14.400
So I'm just worried
if I go to do my own thing

1204
00:51:14.533 --> 00:51:17.066
that it would leave Kate
in a tough spot.

1205
00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:20.066
And I'm just not sure
that Dear Watson

1206
00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:22.467
could totally
function without me.

1207
00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:24.066
I thought you said
it was your sister's company.

1208
00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:27.333
Yeah. it is.
Well. I mean. was.
Um. okay.

1209
00:51:27.467 --> 00:51:30.066
So shortly after
she started her business.

1210
00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:31.900
she got a really big order
for her designs

1211
00:51:32.033 --> 00:51:33.300
for a huge retailer

1212
00:51:33.433 --> 00:51:35.967
and it was her big break.
she needed some help.

1213
00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:38.033
So I postponed school

1214
00:51:38.166 --> 00:51:39.900
and my parents
invested a big chunk

1215
00:51:40.033 --> 00:51:41.166
in the seed money.

1216
00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:44.533
and I used my tuition
to cover the rest.

1217
00:51:45.033 --> 00:51:48.700
Wow. that's a pretty
selfless thing to do.

1218
00:51:48.834 --> 00:51:50.667
I mean. it was her big break.

1219
00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:53.000
you know. I wanted to do
whatever I could to help.

1220
00:51:53.133 --> 00:51:55.467
I mean. she's such
a talented designer.

1221
00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:57.667
And. uh. yeah. now. the company
is really taking off

1222
00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:01.567
and she wants me to be
50/50 partners with her.

1223
00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:03.533
That's amazing.

1224
00:52:03.667 --> 00:52:04.934
Yeah.

1225
00:52:05.066 --> 00:52:06.600
Uh-hmm.

1226
00:52:07.233 --> 00:52:11.333
But that isn't your dream.
is it?

1227
00:52:13.333 --> 00:52:16.633
I don't really know anymore.

1228
00:52:16.767 --> 00:52:19.800
I'm really proud
of what we've built

1229
00:52:19.934 --> 00:52:24.033
and. uh. I obviously love
working with my family. right?

1230
00:52:24.166 --> 00:52:26.734
But just the thought
of going back to school

1231
00:52:26.867 --> 00:52:28.200
really excites me.

1232
00:52:28.333 --> 00:52:30.633
And it makes me really happy.

1233
00:52:31.166 --> 00:52:33.934
Uh. but I don't-I don't know.

1234
00:52:34.066 --> 00:52:35.633
I just don't know
if I can start all over.

1235
00:52:35.767 --> 00:52:38.667
I think you gotta ask
yourself what's worse.

1236
00:52:39.166 --> 00:52:41.433
Starting over or giving up.

1237
00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:52.333
You know what?
I have an idea.

1238
00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:57.400
What are we doing here?

1239
00:52:57.533 --> 00:52:59.233
All right. We got to find you

1240
00:52:59.367 --> 00:53:02.166
a replacement ring.
until we find yours.

1241
00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:05.100
Don't want you to wear
out your finger.

1242
00:53:05.233 --> 00:53:06.867
I don't even realize
I'm doing it.

1243
00:53:08.166 --> 00:53:10.133
Oh. yup.

1244
00:53:10.967 --> 00:53:12.533
Okay.

1245
00:53:12.667 --> 00:53:14.367
This is made of black coral.

1246
00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:17.367
which is the official
state gemstone of Hawaii.

1247
00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:18.600
Oh.

1248
00:53:18.734 --> 00:53:20.533
It's not gonna hold
the same sentimental value.

1249
00:53:20.667 --> 00:53:22.333
but the Honu is known
to bring good luck.

1250
00:53:22.467 --> 00:53:24.033
Sea turtles
were believed to have led

1251
00:53:24.166 --> 00:53:25.834
the original Polynesians
to this island.

1252
00:53:25.967 --> 00:53:29.367
so maybe it'll help us
find what we're looking for.

1253
00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:35.400
Thank you.

1254
00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:40.400
I love it.

1255
00:53:41.367 --> 00:53:43.734
- Thank you.
- Yeah. you're welcome.

1256
00:53:46.667 --> 00:53:47.867
Oh. time.

1257
00:53:49.433 --> 00:53:50.800
Oh. my gosh.
Uh. rehearsal.

1258
00:53:50.934 --> 00:53:52.100
I got to go--

1259
00:53:52.233 --> 00:53:54.300
uh. I got to go
back to the resort.

1260
00:53:54.433 --> 00:53:55.700
Yeah. Yeah. I should
probably try to get

1261
00:53:55.834 --> 00:53:57.367
another dive in
while there's still light.

1262
00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:58.667
Can I give you a ride?

1263
00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:00.433
Uh. well. that depends.

1264
00:54:00.567 --> 00:54:01.900
Yeah. I'm listening.

1265
00:54:02.033 --> 00:54:03.700
If I can drive your Jeep.

1266
00:54:03.834 --> 00:54:05.367
All right.

1267
00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:06.867
If you burn the clutch out.
I'm putting it on your bill.

1268
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:08.533
- Oh. worth every penny.
- Yeah.

1269
00:54:08.667 --> 00:54:09.567
Yeah.

1270
00:54:20.967 --> 00:54:25.033
So the music starts
playing and we're walking.

1271
00:54:25.166 --> 00:54:27.000
The father of the bride

1272
00:54:27.133 --> 00:54:29.834
takes the gorgeous
bride down here.

1273
00:54:29.967 --> 00:54:31.867
We stop. we trade places.

1274
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.867
And now. you're the officiant.

1275
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.767
Look at that. Beautiful.

1276
00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:39.266
You greet everybody
with welcome remarks

1277
00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:42.567
and then.
we start the vows.

1278
00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:44.200
So then.
the father of the bride

1279
00:54:44.333 --> 00:54:45.700
says the vows and then.

1280
00:54:45.834 --> 00:54:49.033
you read your personal vows
to each other.

1281
00:54:49.166 --> 00:54:55.200
You ask for the rings. best man
hands over the rings. We do the
ring thing.

1282
00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:13.967
Did you
find your ring?

1283
00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:15.500
Uh. no.

1284
00:55:15.633 --> 00:55:18.300
No. this is a temporary
replacement ring.

1285
00:55:18.433 --> 00:55:20.500
- A gift from Jack.
- Who's Jack?

1286
00:55:20.633 --> 00:55:22.066
The hunky sailorman.
remember?

1287
00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:24.000
Oh. I see. I see.

1288
00:55:28.433 --> 00:55:31.133
So how's the maid of honor
speech coming?

1289
00:55:31.266 --> 00:55:34.066
Um. I got it covered.

1290
00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:36.333
Did I ever tell you the story
of how I met your dad?

1291
00:55:36.467 --> 00:55:39.600
Only about a million times.

1292
00:55:39.734 --> 00:55:42.166
But I will never turn down
hearing it again.

1293
00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:44.133
Well. I was out
for some drinks

1294
00:55:44.266 --> 00:55:45.233
with some girlfriends

1295
00:55:45.367 --> 00:55:46.667
and your dad was bartending

1296
00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:48.800
to put himself through college.

1297
00:55:49.166 --> 00:55:52.166
He told me
he could see the future.

1298
00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:53.934
Do you remember
what you said?

1299
00:55:54.066 --> 00:55:57.667
I think it went a little
something like this.

1300
00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:59.767
From the moment we first met.

1301
00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:02.967
I knew my life will never be
as good as it can be

1302
00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:04.834
if you're not in it.

1303
00:56:04.967 --> 00:56:07.233
I know what's ahead of us.

1304
00:56:07.367 --> 00:56:09.000
The ups. the downs.

1305
00:56:09.133 --> 00:56:10.900
But no matter what.

1306
00:56:11.033 --> 00:56:12.066
we will get through it

1307
00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:15.367
because we'll be together.

1308
00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:18.066
We will make the life
we both want.

1309
00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:20.567
the life we both imagine.

1310
00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:22.500
And I believed him.

1311
00:56:22.633 --> 00:56:25.700
Lucky for me.
it all came true.

1312
00:56:29.867 --> 00:56:31.033
Hi. guys.

1313
00:56:31.166 --> 00:56:32.400
- Hi.
- Hey.

1314
00:56:32.533 --> 00:56:35.233
Um. so. you don't have
to read it now but. um.

1315
00:56:35.367 --> 00:56:36.967
I had the PR team
draft an announcement

1316
00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:40.800
regarding our upcoming
partnership before we left.

1317
00:56:40.934 --> 00:56:43.834
Uh. I just wanted
everyone to weigh in on it.

1318
00:56:43.967 --> 00:56:45.200
There's no rush. though.

1319
00:56:45.333 --> 00:56:46.533
Look at it
when you look at it.

1320
00:56:46.667 --> 00:56:48.033
But I am excited
for the world to know

1321
00:56:48.166 --> 00:56:51.867
that we're in this together.
through thick and thin.

1322
00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:54.066
- Cheers to that.
- Yeah.

1323
00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:55.967
Cheers.

1324
00:57:15.934 --> 00:57:17.567
Ahoy there!

1325
00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:19.567
I was just gonna
write you a note.

1326
00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:21.233
Yeah? What was
the note gonna say?

1327
00:57:21.367 --> 00:57:23.567
Uh. just that
I won't be able to. uh.

1328
00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:25.367
go diving with you
tomorrow morning.

1329
00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:27.400
It's wedding day.
so I got to stick

1330
00:57:27.533 --> 00:57:29.233
by Kate's side. you know.

1331
00:57:29.367 --> 00:57:31.300
give her the royal treatment.

1332
00:57:31.433 --> 00:57:33.533
Just didn't want
you wasting any time

1333
00:57:33.667 --> 00:57:35.433
waiting around for me.
That's all.

1334
00:57:36.333 --> 00:57:38.266
Nothing else
on your mind?

1335
00:57:41.367 --> 00:57:43.333
Uh. what makes you
ask that?

1336
00:57:43.467 --> 00:57:45.066
Well. you came
all the way out here

1337
00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:46.867
when you could have left
a message with Hannah.

1338
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:50.467
Ah.

1339
00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:54.333
I don't know. I guess I'm just
getting a little nervous

1340
00:57:54.467 --> 00:57:55.800
that we're not
gonna find my ring

1341
00:57:55.934 --> 00:57:57.900
before I have to leave.

1342
00:57:59.667 --> 00:58:01.066
Don't leave.

1343
00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:03.200
I wish it were
that simple.

1344
00:58:03.333 --> 00:58:05.633
Right. the whole.
uh. business thing

1345
00:58:05.767 --> 00:58:09.467
with your sister.
the 50/50 partnership.

1346
00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:10.800
Yeah.

1347
00:58:10.934 --> 00:58:12.300
Uh. that's a big deal.

1348
00:58:12.433 --> 00:58:14.500
You come any closer
to making a decision?

1349
00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:17.767
Uh. nope.

1350
00:58:18.734 --> 00:58:20.200
No.

1351
00:58:20.333 --> 00:58:22.033
But they are about to do
a press release

1352
00:58:22.166 --> 00:58:23.233
to tell the world
that I have.

1353
00:58:23.367 --> 00:58:24.433
Uh-hmm.

1354
00:58:24.567 --> 00:58:26.934
Everyone is just so thrilled.

1355
00:58:27.066 --> 00:58:29.266
I should be thrilled. I...

1356
00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:31.467
I mean. turning down
such an amazing opportunity.

1357
00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:34.300
that would be just--
that'd be crazy.

1358
00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:36.166
Wouldn't it?

1359
00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:37.767
What are you
more concerned with.

1360
00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:40.400
what your family wants
or what you want?

1361
00:58:43.333 --> 00:58:44.633
I don't wanna upset them.

1362
00:58:44.767 --> 00:58:46.667
What about
upsetting yourself?

1363
00:58:47.367 --> 00:58:49.633
You don't wanna
become a supporting player

1364
00:58:49.767 --> 00:58:51.367
in your own
life story. right?

1365
00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:54.433
You wanna be the. you know.
the leading lady.

1366
00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:01.200
Oh. gosh. you are--

1367
00:59:01.333 --> 00:59:03.133
you are insufferably insightful.

1368
00:59:03.266 --> 00:59:04.800
Yeah. I know.

1369
00:59:05.467 --> 00:59:07.767
It doesn't make it
any easier. though.

1370
00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:09.300
I know.

1371
00:59:10.667 --> 00:59:12.800
All right. Well. uh.
I'll see you at the wedding.

1372
00:59:12.934 --> 00:59:15.633
Uh. hey! Um.

1373
00:59:16.667 --> 00:59:18.867
do you wanna go
on a night sail?

1374
00:59:20.266 --> 00:59:23.200
Is that a--
is that a thing?

1375
00:59:23.333 --> 00:59:24.867
One of my favorite things.

1376
00:59:25.934 --> 00:59:27.600
Are you gonna make me
wear a life jacket again?

1377
00:59:27.734 --> 00:59:29.734
- Absolutely.
- No.

1378
00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:34.667
Fine.

1379
00:59:59.934 --> 01:00:01.834
Wait. don't you need
to be steering the boat?

1380
01:00:01.967 --> 01:00:03.367
Do you remember
that large piece of metal

1381
01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.233
I threw into the ocean?

1382
01:00:05.633 --> 01:00:08.333
It's called an anchor.

1383
01:00:08.467 --> 01:00:10.133
Okay. Well then.
can I take this off now?

1384
01:00:10.266 --> 01:00:12.633
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

1385
01:00:12.767 --> 01:00:15.367
- Okay.
- You look good in red. though.

1386
01:00:17.967 --> 01:00:19.633
Ah. Yeah.

1387
01:00:19.767 --> 01:00:21.133
Ah. Yeah.

1388
01:00:21.266 --> 01:00:23.033
A girl could
get used to this.

1389
01:00:23.166 --> 01:00:24.133
I knew
you'd come around.

1390
01:00:24.266 --> 01:00:26.133
No. you didn't.

1391
01:00:26.266 --> 01:00:27.300
That's true.

1392
01:00:27.433 --> 01:00:29.667
But I hoped you would.

1393
01:00:31.066 --> 01:00:32.800
So. how close are you

1394
01:00:32.934 --> 01:00:34.133
to having enough
money saved

1395
01:00:34.266 --> 01:00:36.133
for your big trip
around the world?

1396
01:00:36.266 --> 01:00:37.600
- Close.
- Really?

1397
01:00:37.734 --> 01:00:39.433
And once I find this
elusive ring of yours...

1398
01:00:39.567 --> 01:00:41.367
- Uh-hmm.
- ...the recovery fee

1399
01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:42.667
should put me
over the top.

1400
01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:45.000
Well. that makes me
really happy.

1401
01:00:45.133 --> 01:00:47.533
For you and my right
ring finger. of course.

1402
01:00:47.667 --> 01:00:49.033
- Of course.
- Of course. yeah.

1403
01:00:51.734 --> 01:00:54.500
Uh. yeah. it's funny.

1404
01:00:54.633 --> 01:00:57.967
You know. I've been saving up
for this trip for so long.

1405
01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:00.400
it just kind of seemed
like it would never happen.

1406
01:01:00.533 --> 01:01:02.100
And now that it's within reach.
that it's a--

1407
01:01:02.233 --> 01:01:04.066
it's a real possibility.

1408
01:01:04.767 --> 01:01:08.967
my emotions are just
kind of all over the place.

1409
01:01:10.967 --> 01:01:12.734
Well. why do you think
you have so many emotions

1410
01:01:12.867 --> 01:01:14.734
tied up in this trip?

1411
01:01:16.033 --> 01:01:19.200
After my mom died.
uh. my dad and I planned

1412
01:01:19.333 --> 01:01:21.000
on sailing around
the world together.

1413
01:01:21.133 --> 01:01:24.233
But before we got
around to it. he got sick.

1414
01:01:24.667 --> 01:01:26.600
He made me promise
that I would make the trip

1415
01:01:26.734 --> 01:01:28.266
after he was gone.

1416
01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:29.867
He refused to let me
sell The Gem

1417
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.200
even to help
with the medical bills.

1418
01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:36.367
I think he knew this old boat
would keep him around.

1419
01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.433
even after he was gone.

1420
01:01:41.467 --> 01:01:44.567
Well. thank you
for sharing that with me.

1421
01:01:45.166 --> 01:01:47.066
I know that's not easy.

1422
01:01:52.066 --> 01:01:55.033
People come and go
so much on this island.

1423
01:01:56.967 --> 01:02:00.934
I think that's why I choose
not to get close to anyone.

1424
01:02:01.767 --> 01:02:06.600
It's just easier
to be alone. you know?

1425
01:02:09.133 --> 01:02:10.967
But I wasn't expecting this.

1426
01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:14.500
This is the last thing
I was expecting

1427
01:02:14.633 --> 01:02:16.300
to find on this island.

1428
01:02:18.567 --> 01:02:20.633
At least
we're on the same page.

1429
01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.066
Thank you! Thank you!

1430
01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:00.834
You're very talented.

1431
01:03:00.967 --> 01:03:02.533
It comes in handy
when the karaoke
machine goes down.

1432
01:03:02.667 --> 01:03:05.333
Where are you
coming from?

1433
01:03:05.734 --> 01:03:10.066
Uh. I went
night sailing with Jack.

1434
01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:11.600
Say no more.

1435
01:03:14.033 --> 01:03:16.867
Oh. no. no.

1436
01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.800
this is his move. isn't it?

1437
01:03:18.934 --> 01:03:21.233
Night sailing. really?

1438
01:03:21.367 --> 01:03:22.667
What a line.

1439
01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.667
Addie. I've known
Jack for years.

1440
01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:26.066
long enough
to consider him a friend.

1441
01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:29.500
And in all that time.
I have never known him

1442
01:03:29.633 --> 01:03:30.867
to take a guest out sailing.

1443
01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.500
unless it was paid charter.

1444
01:03:33.233 --> 01:03:36.867
Do yourself a favor
and don't overthink this one.

1445
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.500
You got a big day tomorrow.

1446
01:03:38.633 --> 01:03:40.934
Just get
a good night's sleep. okay?

1447
01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:46.200
Yeah. No. I'll try.
Thank you for everything.

1448
01:03:46.333 --> 01:03:47.900
It's my absolute pleasure.

1449
01:03:48.033 --> 01:03:49.166
Okay.

1450
01:05:02.633 --> 01:05:05.367
All right.
are you ready?

1451
01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:06.900
Okay.

1452
01:05:11.967 --> 01:05:13.467
Oh. be careful. Mom.

1453
01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:14.533
you're gonna
ruin your makeup

1454
01:05:14.667 --> 01:05:16.300
before the ceremony.

1455
01:05:16.433 --> 01:05:17.767
Everything is set.

1456
01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:19.300
We'll start
when you give the word.

1457
01:05:19.433 --> 01:05:20.900
Okay.

1458
01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:23.200
Okay.

1459
01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:26.000
Oh.

1460
01:05:28.967 --> 01:05:30.367
How are you feeling?

1461
01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:31.500
- Perfect.
- Uh-hmm.

1462
01:05:31.633 --> 01:05:33.700
Yeah. completely at peace.

1463
01:05:33.834 --> 01:05:36.667
everything came together
so seamlessly.

1464
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.800
Thanks for always
being by my side.

1465
01:05:39.934 --> 01:05:42.734
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1466
01:05:45.567 --> 01:05:46.500
Let's get you married.

1467
01:05:46.633 --> 01:05:49.033
Okay.

1468
01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:08.900
We are gathered
here today

1469
01:06:09.033 --> 01:06:13.166
to join Kate and Nathan
in holy matrimony.

1470
01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:14.900
My dear mother.
your loving grandmother.

1471
01:06:15.033 --> 01:06:17.066
Helen believed in magic.

1472
01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:20.867
You're the most incredible
woman I've ever met.

1473
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.867
I choose you today.

1474
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.867
and every day.
for the rest of my life.

1475
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.934
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

1476
01:06:29.066 --> 01:06:30.700
You may kiss the bride.

1477
01:06:47.233 --> 01:06:48.300
I'm so glad you guys
are married.

1478
01:06:48.433 --> 01:06:50.266
Hi.
How are you. guys?

1479
01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:52.834
- I am so...
- Are you having fun?

1480
01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:57.500
Well. yeah.
I'll see you soon.

1481
01:06:57.633 --> 01:06:58.934
Hi. Oh.

1482
01:06:59.066 --> 01:07:00.467
You've been so busy taking
care of everybody else.

1483
01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:03.133
I figured it was my turn
to take care of you.

1484
01:07:03.266 --> 01:07:06.100
- Oh. thank you. Cheers.
- Cheers.

1485
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.633
Hmm. how beautiful
was that ceremony?

1486
01:07:09.767 --> 01:07:12.000
- Every bit of it.
- Hey. how was this morning?

1487
01:07:12.133 --> 01:07:13.900
We're getting closer.
We know where it isn't.

1488
01:07:14.033 --> 01:07:15.500
- Uh-hmm.
- Right?

1489
01:07:15.633 --> 01:07:17.467
And. uh. there's not much
more ground to cover so.

1490
01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:20.200
I mean. at least
we're narrowing it down.

1491
01:07:22.133 --> 01:07:24.834
I won't stop until it's back
on this finger.

1492
01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:28.734
Oh. wow.
Well. that was a move.

1493
01:07:28.867 --> 01:07:30.233
I thought so.

1494
01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:32.400
Ladies and gentlemen.

1495
01:07:32.533 --> 01:07:34.900
can I have
your attention. please?

1496
01:07:35.033 --> 01:07:36.834
It's time for the Maid of Honor

1497
01:07:36.967 --> 01:07:38.200
and Best Man speeches.

1498
01:07:38.333 --> 01:07:39.900
Knock 'em dead.

1499
01:07:40.033 --> 01:07:42.333
No pressure. thank you.

1500
01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:45.834
Aloha. everyone.

1501
01:07:45.967 --> 01:07:48.233
For those of you
who don't know me.
my name is Addie.

1502
01:07:48.367 --> 01:07:50.333
I am Kate's little sister.

1503
01:07:50.467 --> 01:07:52.233
First off. I just wanna
say thank you so much

1504
01:07:52.367 --> 01:07:54.200
for making the effort
in spending

1505
01:07:54.333 --> 01:07:57.767
this very special day
with Kate and Nathan.

1506
01:07:58.967 --> 01:08:00.633
When I look around

1507
01:08:00.767 --> 01:08:03.300
and I see the love

1508
01:08:03.433 --> 01:08:05.500
on Kate and Nathan's face.

1509
01:08:06.734 --> 01:08:09.567
and the love here.

1510
01:08:11.066 --> 01:08:13.133
it almost feels like magic.

1511
01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:15.467
I know what you're thinking.

1512
01:08:16.133 --> 01:08:17.900
I am known as the skeptic

1513
01:08:18.033 --> 01:08:22.100
when it comes to believing
in anything that you cannot

1514
01:08:22.233 --> 01:08:25.066
see with your eyes
or touch with your hands.

1515
01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:28.300
But. I mean.
what these two have.

1516
01:08:28.433 --> 01:08:31.800
it's just--it's undeniable.

1517
01:08:32.133 --> 01:08:34.600
It is enough to turn

1518
01:08:34.734 --> 01:08:39.133
even the hardest
of hearts into a believer.

1519
01:08:41.333 --> 01:08:44.200
Okay.
So I would like to make a toast

1520
01:08:44.333 --> 01:08:47.133
to not only the bride
and groom.

1521
01:08:47.266 --> 01:08:52.900
but to the long line
of believers out there.

1522
01:08:53.033 --> 01:08:54.500
You all helped me
believe in magic.

1523
01:08:56.333 --> 01:09:00.200
So cheers to Kate and Nathan.

1524
01:09:00.333 --> 01:09:01.433
We love you. guys.

1525
01:09:18.333 --> 01:09:20.433
Your speech
destroyed the best man's.

1526
01:09:20.567 --> 01:09:22.333
by the way.
There's no contest.

1527
01:09:22.467 --> 01:09:24.166
Well. I mean. he did bring up
an ex-girlfriend.

1528
01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:25.767
so instant disqualification.

1529
01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:28.333
- Total rookie move.
- The rookiest.

1530
01:09:30.333 --> 01:09:31.867
You enjoying yourself?

1531
01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.200
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1532
01:09:33.333 --> 01:09:34.867
Yeah.
I'm having an amazing time.

1533
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.266
Oh. I'm glad.

1534
01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:37.867
Not just tonight.

1535
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.133
the whole week.

1536
01:09:39.266 --> 01:09:41.667
Good. So have I.

1537
01:09:43.467 --> 01:09:45.500
You know. I can't believe
I have to leave tomorrow.

1538
01:09:45.633 --> 01:09:48.800
I know. Uh. that's why
I got you a little.

1539
01:09:48.934 --> 01:09:51.133
um. going away present.

1540
01:09:51.266 --> 01:09:52.800
Technically.
I got it for me.

1541
01:09:52.934 --> 01:09:54.300
but I think you'll understand.

1542
01:09:54.433 --> 01:09:55.834
In this case.
it truly is the thought

1543
01:09:55.967 --> 01:09:57.367
- that counts.
- Okay.

1544
01:09:58.734 --> 01:10:01.033
I haven't quite
figured out how it works.

1545
01:10:01.166 --> 01:10:02.633
Smartphone might be
smarter than me.

1546
01:10:02.767 --> 01:10:05.633
- Oh. my gosh.
- Um. just to. uh. clarify this.

1547
01:10:05.767 --> 01:10:08.633
you're the only person I'm
trusting with the number. too.

1548
01:10:08.767 --> 01:10:10.867
Okay. I'm so flattered.

1549
01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.467
Um. well. okay. um.

1550
01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:17.033
turn on your Bluetooth and
I will AirDrop you my contact.

1551
01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:19.867
- I'm--what? You would--
- Yeah.

1552
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.166
- Give it to me.
- Okay.

1553
01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:23.166
I will just do it
the old-fashioned way.

1554
01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:25.667
All right. Okay.

1555
01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:27.200
Addie.

1556
01:10:29.467 --> 01:10:33.000
All right.
Stay in touch. okay?

1557
01:10:33.133 --> 01:10:35.800
I want a picture
every port that you stop at.

1558
01:10:35.934 --> 01:10:38.133
- All right. deal.
- Okay.

1559
01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:41.367
And. uh.
you got to let me know

1560
01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:43.467
what you decide to do with
your sister and the company.

1561
01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:47.500
Yeah. For what it's worth.

1562
01:10:48.233 --> 01:10:52.900
I really hope you decide to do
what you think is best for you.

1563
01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:56.200
And I know
you're leaving tomorrow.

1564
01:10:56.333 --> 01:10:59.100
but I wanted
to tell you that I--

1565
01:10:59.233 --> 01:11:01.066
I'm gonna find
that ring of yours.

1566
01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:02.767
You know.
I mean--well. I mean.

1567
01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:05.700
I'm not gonna stop looking
for it even after you go.

1568
01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:08.200
Don't lose hope.

1569
01:11:09.133 --> 01:11:13.166
And if there's any magic
left in that ring.

1570
01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:14.800
I know it's gonna turn up.

1571
01:11:16.367 --> 01:11:18.300
I hope you're right.

1572
01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:24.266
Well. I should get going.

1573
01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:26.433
- Yeah.
- Try to get some sleep.

1574
01:11:26.567 --> 01:11:28.433
I got an early dive
in the morning.

1575
01:11:28.567 --> 01:11:30.667
Yeah.

1576
01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:33.633
Yeah. No worries. No.
I should probably
get back to my family.

1577
01:11:35.633 --> 01:11:39.233
Actually.
let me finish that dance.

1578
01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:43.033
You know.
I thought you'd never ask.

1579
01:12:33.066 --> 01:12:34.934
Oh.

1580
01:12:43.934 --> 01:12:45.533
Jackpot.

1581
01:13:43.333 --> 01:13:45.100
...leave early.

1582
01:13:45.233 --> 01:13:46.600
Hello. Welcome.

1583
01:13:46.734 --> 01:13:48.400
I'm here to help
with everything and anything

1584
01:13:48.533 --> 01:13:51.266
you might need to make your stay
with us more enjoyable.

1585
01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:54.100
No request is too big.

1586
01:14:13.233 --> 01:14:15.400
Oh. And so it begins.

1587
01:14:15.533 --> 01:14:18.266
- Hmm. the office?
- Yeah.

1588
01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:19.900
What? What's the drama?

1589
01:14:20.033 --> 01:14:22.567
No. no. no. Technically.
you are on your honeymoon.

1590
01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:24.667
so I'm not gonna
bug you with work.

1591
01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:26.633
Technically. you're still
in my bridal party.

1592
01:14:26.767 --> 01:14:28.667
So if I tell you
to shut your phone off

1593
01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:30.934
and enjoy the scenery.
you have to oblige.

1594
01:14:31.066 --> 01:14:32.500
- Are you serious?
- Uh-hmm.

1595
01:14:32.633 --> 01:14:34.667
Babe. need me
to get your bride card?

1596
01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:38.166
I don't think
that will be necessary.

1597
01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:39.834
- my dear husband.
- Okay.

1598
01:14:39.967 --> 01:14:41.433
Will it?

1599
01:14:41.567 --> 01:14:43.000
Come on.

1600
01:14:43.133 --> 01:14:44.433
All right.

1601
01:14:44.567 --> 01:14:46.600
- Happy?
- Yes. Good.

1602
01:14:46.734 --> 01:14:48.433
Hey. you'll have
plenty of quality time

1603
01:14:48.567 --> 01:14:50.133
in the office
when we get back home.

1604
01:14:50.266 --> 01:14:51.300
I just want you to enjoy

1605
01:14:51.433 --> 01:14:53.934
your last few moments
in paradise.

1606
01:14:54.066 --> 01:14:56.200
Okay.

1607
01:15:00.166 --> 01:15:02.867
What do you think?
Is this Addie's ring?

1608
01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:06.867
Hundred percent.
without a doubt. that is it.

1609
01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.734
- Where did you find it?
- Oh. I went out

1610
01:15:08.867 --> 01:15:10.700
for a midnight hunt
last night as I'm wont to do.

1611
01:15:10.834 --> 01:15:13.400
and I found this baby
on the beach under about.

1612
01:15:13.533 --> 01:15:15.667
I don't know.
three inches of sand.

1613
01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:17.633
Tide must have
brought it in. Geez.

1614
01:15:17.767 --> 01:15:19.367
Yeah.
I figured a guest lost it.

1615
01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:20.667
I'd like to do the right thing.

1616
01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:22.500
get it back
to the owner if I can.

1617
01:15:22.633 --> 01:15:24.066
Yeah. That's fantastic!
She's gonna be thrilled.

1618
01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:27.433
Well. I said I would like
to do the right thing.

1619
01:15:27.767 --> 01:15:31.633
I just wanna make sure that all
of our interests are aligned.

1620
01:15:31.767 --> 01:15:34.200
you know. if you know
what I mean.

1621
01:15:34.333 --> 01:15:35.734
I don't. actually.

1622
01:15:35.867 --> 01:15:38.000
Uh. okay. Well. I'll just be
a little more direct.

1623
01:15:38.133 --> 01:15:40.066
Um. I had it appraised.

1624
01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:42.734
I was shocked to find out
how much it's worth.

1625
01:15:42.867 --> 01:15:45.633
And. uh. I figured
we can come to some kind

1626
01:15:45.767 --> 01:15:47.567
of arrangement
on a finder's fee.

1627
01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:51.800
- What kind of finder's fee?
- Uh. well. it. um. depends.

1628
01:15:51.934 --> 01:15:54.233
You know. I feel like I should
be talking to the owner.

1629
01:15:54.367 --> 01:15:56.233
They left for the airport
about an hour ago.

1630
01:15:56.367 --> 01:15:59.233
- I'll give her a call.
- Ooh.

1631
01:16:00.533 --> 01:16:03.367
Oh. it's going
straight to voicemail.

1632
01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:04.934
She might already be
on the plane.

1633
01:16:05.066 --> 01:16:06.400
What about Kate?
Can you call her?

1634
01:16:06.533 --> 01:16:07.767
Addie was
my only point of contact.

1635
01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:09.433
- I'll try one more time.
- Hey. whatever.

1636
01:16:09.567 --> 01:16:11.100
Look. give her my phone number.

1637
01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:13.033
Tell her to call me
whenever she gets a chance.

1638
01:16:13.166 --> 01:16:15.967
Wait. Hold on one second.
I don't think you understand.

1639
01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:18.567
- I need to get that ring to her.
- I think I'd rather wait

1640
01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:20.300
- to see what she wants.
- Well. how much do you want?

1641
01:16:20.433 --> 01:16:22.200
I don't wanna
sound uncouth here.

1642
01:16:22.333 --> 01:16:25.066
but yeah. according to Sonny.
I mean. this is what it's worth.

1643
01:16:26.533 --> 01:16:27.800
That there is on the low end.

1644
01:16:27.934 --> 01:16:29.867
- Is this real?
- Yeah.

1645
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.800
Look. I'm not looking
to take advantage of anybody.

1646
01:16:31.934 --> 01:16:34.800
but I think maybe if
we come up with this right here.

1647
01:16:34.934 --> 01:16:37.266
- it'll help loosen my grip.
- Are you kidding?

1648
01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:39.266
- That's extortion.
- Hey. Sonny offered me

1649
01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:41.900
a lot more than that.
If anything. I'm the hero here.

1650
01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:44.734
I'll get you the money.

1651
01:16:44.867 --> 01:16:47.367
Terrific! Okay.

1652
01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:49.400
- When and where?
- My boat at the harbor.

1653
01:16:49.533 --> 01:16:51.633
Gem of the Ocean.
I'll pay in cash.

1654
01:16:51.767 --> 01:16:54.133
Even better.
You're kidding.

1655
01:16:54.266 --> 01:16:56.367
Excuse me.
Can we have a minute. please?

1656
01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:58.934
Yeah. you guys. Yeah.

1657
01:16:59.834 --> 01:17:01.867
I'm just gonna--
I'll just pop over here

1658
01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.200
while you guys
just figure that out.

1659
01:17:04.333 --> 01:17:05.433
What do you think you're doing?

1660
01:17:05.567 --> 01:17:07.400
You know exactly what I'm doing.

1661
01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:09.633
Maybe we can call the police.

1662
01:17:09.767 --> 01:17:11.300
- They might be able to help.
- It's too messy.

1663
01:17:11.433 --> 01:17:13.834
The second we call.
he's gonna be gone for good.

1664
01:17:13.967 --> 01:17:16.066
Trust me. we got to take care
of this right now.

1665
01:17:17.967 --> 01:17:19.333
What about your trip?

1666
01:17:19.467 --> 01:17:21.667
It doesn't matter.
It's the right thing to do.

1667
01:17:23.333 --> 01:17:25.367
- It's happening?
- Yeah.

1668
01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:26.834
It's happening.
Okay. Bye-bye.

1669
01:17:26.967 --> 01:17:28.567
Woo. All right.

1670
01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:34.433
Hey. you wanna talk about it?

1671
01:17:35.433 --> 01:17:37.400
Um. I don't know.

1672
01:17:37.533 --> 01:17:41.500
I guess I just have been
feeling a little lost lately.

1673
01:17:41.633 --> 01:17:44.133
- Addie.
- No. I'm serious. I mean.

1674
01:17:44.266 --> 01:17:45.667
you've always known
what you've wanted

1675
01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:49.033
and you've just gone for it.
right. with work.

1676
01:17:49.166 --> 01:17:51.066
with your education.
with Nathan.

1677
01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:53.967
I mean. look
how successful you are.

1678
01:17:54.100 --> 01:17:55.667
Thank you.

1679
01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:57.767
You know. I couldn't do
any of that without you.

1680
01:17:58.767 --> 01:18:01.600
If you're feeling
unsure about what's ahead.

1681
01:18:01.734 --> 01:18:03.934
you lean into
the people you love.

1682
01:18:04.066 --> 01:18:05.433
Talk it out.

1683
01:18:05.567 --> 01:18:07.767
And when the universe
sends you a sign.

1684
01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:10.800
you got to be
brave enough to follow it.

1685
01:18:20.533 --> 01:18:23.934
Wait. wait.
Um. can you turn left here?

1686
01:18:24.066 --> 01:18:26.066
Hi. guys.

1687
01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:32.100
I think
I just got my sign.

1688
01:18:38.533 --> 01:18:40.633
- Addie.
- Yeah.

1689
01:18:40.767 --> 01:18:42.800
Are you sure about this?

1690
01:18:43.734 --> 01:18:47.200
No. no.
I am not actually.

1691
01:18:47.333 --> 01:18:48.900
Um...

1692
01:18:49.900 --> 01:18:53.166
but I know that I need
to do what I truly love.

1693
01:18:53.567 --> 01:18:55.633
I got to get back in the water.

1694
01:18:56.834 --> 01:19:02.033
So I'm gonna stay on the island
and figure some things out.

1695
01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:06.600
Hey. I don't regret one minute

1696
01:19:06.734 --> 01:19:08.500
of what we did together. okay?

1697
01:19:08.633 --> 01:19:12.133
Okay. I am-- I am
so proud of everything

1698
01:19:12.266 --> 01:19:13.667
that we built and I am so.

1699
01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:17.066
so excited
to watch your dream grow.

1700
01:19:18.967 --> 01:19:21.033
But you're right. Kate.

1701
01:19:21.166 --> 01:19:22.533
I got to go after mine.

1702
01:19:22.667 --> 01:19:25.600
The door is
and always will be open. okay?

1703
01:19:25.734 --> 01:19:27.433
- Okay.
- And you'll always be

1704
01:19:27.567 --> 01:19:28.667
welcomed back with open arms.

1705
01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:30.867
I love you so much.

1706
01:19:32.233 --> 01:19:36.600
Aw. thank you.
I love you guys.

1707
01:19:36.734 --> 01:19:38.000
- We love you too.
- Go get your flight. okay?

1708
01:19:38.133 --> 01:19:40.533
- Don't be late.
- All right.

1709
01:19:41.433 --> 01:19:42.967
I love you.

1710
01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:54.367
Gosh. I can't believe that
there's room in the program.

1711
01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:55.867
I'm so excited to start.

1712
01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.500
From what I see
in your resume.

1713
01:19:57.633 --> 01:19:58.834
it seems like
you're a perfect fit.

1714
01:19:58.967 --> 01:20:00.834
- so congratulations.
- Thank you.

1715
01:20:00.967 --> 01:20:03.567
- It's gonna be great. Yeah.
- Oh. my gosh.

1716
01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.700
Yeah. I thought
about getting one of these.

1717
01:20:07.834 --> 01:20:09.767
So it's just a lot
smarter to rent. you know.

1718
01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:12.800
It's just smarter to rent.

1719
01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:15.767
Yeah. I'm a bit more of a
landlubber myself.

1720
01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:18.000
because. you know.
if I get the feel. you know.

1721
01:20:18.133 --> 01:20:21.500
the open sea to set
the sail.

1722
01:20:21.633 --> 01:20:24.834
Mind if we. uh.
cut the chitchat?

1723
01:20:24.967 --> 01:20:27.133
I'll tell you
right now if we can.

1724
01:20:27.266 --> 01:20:28.433
Let me take a look.

1725
01:20:28.567 --> 01:20:30.600
- It's all there.
- Looks good.

1726
01:20:30.734 --> 01:20:32.667
Everything is in order.

1727
01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:36.800
It is a pleasure
to do business with you. sir.

1728
01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:39.200
I assure you
the pleasure is all yours.

1729
01:20:39.333 --> 01:20:41.633
Yes. it is.

1730
01:20:41.767 --> 01:20:43.700
Yes. it is.

1731
01:20:54.433 --> 01:20:56.367
Please leave a
message at the tone.

1732
01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:58.600
Addie. Hello?

1733
01:20:58.734 --> 01:21:00.533
Uh. it's Jack.

1734
01:21:00.667 --> 01:21:02.900
Uh. I hope I'm doing this right.

1735
01:21:03.033 --> 01:21:05.500
You're probably a million miles
up in the sky right now.

1736
01:21:05.633 --> 01:21:07.934
but I...

1737
01:21:08.066 --> 01:21:09.900
I have some very important news...

1738
01:21:10.033 --> 01:21:12.734
...to tell you.

1739
01:21:12.867 --> 01:21:16.934
Uh. I think
you're calling me.

1740
01:21:18.033 --> 01:21:19.900
Yeah. I think you're calling me.

1741
01:21:20.033 --> 01:21:21.900
Uh. hello. Addie?

1742
01:21:22.033 --> 01:21:24.600
Hello.
Did you miss me already?

1743
01:21:24.734 --> 01:21:26.066
Oh. hey. Where are you?

1744
01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:27.867
I thought you were supposed
to be on a plane.

1745
01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.600
Yeah. I. uh.
I was supposed to be.

1746
01:21:30.734 --> 01:21:33.000
but plans changed.

1747
01:21:33.133 --> 01:21:35.667
I-I couldn't leave.

1748
01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:39.333
I had too much unfinished
business here.

1749
01:21:39.467 --> 01:21:41.934
And I also couldn't leave

1750
01:21:42.066 --> 01:21:45.633
knowing that I left something
so important behind.

1751
01:21:46.433 --> 01:21:48.867
Hey. I think
I can help you with that.

1752
01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:53.800
Yeah. You know.
I. uh. certainly hope so.

1753
01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:01.934
Permission to come aboard?

1754
01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:03.834
Do you even have to ask?

1755
01:22:03.967 --> 01:22:05.633
Well. it hasn't really
stopped me before.

1756
01:22:10.266 --> 01:22:11.800
Are you up for a sail?

1757
01:22:12.433 --> 01:22:13.767
Always.

1758
01:22:24.734 --> 01:22:26.967
Oh. my God.

1759
01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:28.467
I can't believe
you got it back!

1760
01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:30.600
Uh. it wasn't me.

1761
01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:32.433
it was the island.

1762
01:22:32.567 --> 01:22:34.100
And the beachcomber.

1763
01:22:34.233 --> 01:22:36.000
The magic of the ring
brought it to him.

1764
01:22:36.133 --> 01:22:38.567
Oh. okay.

1765
01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:40.633
Oh. my gosh.

1766
01:22:40.767 --> 01:22:43.667
But your trip
and your savings. I just--

1767
01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:45.000
- Ah.
- I can't believe you did

1768
01:22:45.133 --> 01:22:47.166
- all that for me.
- Yeah. My trip can wait.

1769
01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:49.734
Plus. the look on your face
when I put it back on

1770
01:22:49.867 --> 01:22:51.767
was worth every penny.

1771
01:22:52.633 --> 01:22:53.667
Well. hey. I was thinking.

1772
01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:56.567
if your trip can wait
until after

1773
01:22:56.700 --> 01:22:58.300
my summer program is over.

1774
01:22:58.433 --> 01:23:01.934
uh. maybe I could join you.

1775
01:23:02.767 --> 01:23:04.133
Oh. I would love that.

1776
01:23:04.266 --> 01:23:06.367
Um. unfortunately.
it's gonna take me

1777
01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:08.166
a bit longer than three months
to earn that money back.

1778
01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:10.066
- Okay. Well. I can help.
- Uh-hmm.

1779
01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:12.567
And. you know.
maybe we can get sponsored

1780
01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:15.700
by some cool
and upcoming clothing brand.

1781
01:23:15.834 --> 01:23:17.633
Have you ever heard
of Dear Watson?

1782
01:23:17.767 --> 01:23:19.033
- Yeah. They're really cool.
- Yeah.

1783
01:23:19.166 --> 01:23:20.333
Do you have connections
in that world?

1784
01:23:20.467 --> 01:23:22.233
- Yeah. a few. A few.
- Oh.

1785
01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:25.867
Okay. So you got
your ring back.

1786
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.834
you're gonna be
studying what you love

1787
01:23:27.967 --> 01:23:29.734
and you're planning
a sailing trip around the world?

1788
01:23:29.867 --> 01:23:32.000
With an incredibly
handsome man.

1789
01:23:32.133 --> 01:23:34.667
- I might add.
- Debatable. but I'll take it.

1790
01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:37.233
The point is.

1791
01:23:37.367 --> 01:23:41.233
the wind seems to really
be blowing in your direction.

1792
01:23:41.367 --> 01:23:42.467
And?

1793
01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:46.367
And after all that.

1794
01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:48.200
was your grandma right?

1795
01:23:48.333 --> 01:23:52.200
Now do you believe
in the magic of this ring?

1796
01:24:01.834 --> 01:24:04.200
Does that
answer your question?

1797
01:24:04.333 --> 01:24:05.934
Loud and clear.
