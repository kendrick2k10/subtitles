You're not thinking of leaving.
are you?

The party's
just getting started.

9

It's not gonna
be the same without you.

10

You want a drink?
Let me find you a drink.

11
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.250
Thanks. but I'm already
finishing my first one.

12
00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:02.000
I have an early morning
tomorrow. so...

13
00:01:02.083 --> 00:01:04.667
You know those ride-share
apps are pretty dangerous.

Who knows where you'll end up.

15

Hell. you might even find
yourself in a Prius.

Tell you what. stick around.

17
00:01:11.542 --> 00:01:13.125
I promise
I'll get you home myself.

18
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.583
Safe and sound.

19
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.250
I'm Luke.

20
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.667
Sorry. Luke. I'm sure
you're a very good driver.

21
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.833
but I'm gonna take my chances.

22
00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.542
Don't say I didn't warn you.

23
00:01:31.667 --> 00:01:34.500
Kimber! If I knew
you were going to brush off

24
00:01:34.667 --> 00:01:37.292
the hottest guy here.
I never would have invited you.

25
00:01:37.417 --> 00:01:40.500
Uh. well. you promised
I'd have a good time. remember?

26
00:01:40.625 --> 00:01:42.417
You're not?

27
00:01:42.542 --> 00:01:44.292
We're at a college party.
Kimber.

28
00:01:44.417 --> 00:01:47.917
No more parents' basements
or high school gymnasiums.

29
00:01:48.042 --> 00:01:50.833
After all those years
in the kiddie pool.

30
00:01:50.917 --> 00:01:53.333
finally we get to dive right in.

31
00:01:53.458 --> 00:01:57.000
Believe me. he's all yours.

32
00:01:57.125 --> 00:01:58.958
I think his name's Luke.
by the way.

33
00:01:59.042 --> 00:02:00.875
Luke.

34
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.500
I like it.

35
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.458
Look. my dad cheated
on my mom too.

36
00:02:09.583 --> 00:02:12.125
It doesn't mean you get to be
a total buzzkill forever.

37
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.750
Buzzkill? Seriously?

38
00:02:13.875 --> 00:02:16.417
It's cruel. but it's true.

39
00:02:16.542 --> 00:02:18.833
I mean. my parents split
when I was a sophomore.

40
00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.917
You got an extra two years.

41
00:02:21.042 --> 00:02:23.875
It sucks.
but it makes you tougher.

42
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.167
As long as you remember

43
00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:28.500

45
00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:32.542
But first.
I'm gonna go show that boy

46
00:02:32.708 --> 00:02:34.833
what he's been missing
all his life.

47
00:02:38.792 --> 00:02:40.250

00:03:09.042 --> 00:03:11.333
Hi. For Kimber?

49
00:03:11.458 --> 00:03:12.833
Yeah.

00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.667
Hey. could you turn up
that song?

52

It's my favorite.

53
00:03:24.875 --> 00:03:26.667
Oh. sorry. I think
there's been a mistake.

54
00:03:32.375 --> 00:03:33.833
Can you stop the car?

55
00:03:35.042 --> 00:03:36.167
Stop the car!

56
00:03:36.292 --> 00:03:37.583
(tires squealing)

57
00:03:37.708 --> 00:03:39.458
Stop the car!

58
00:03:39.583 --> 00:03:42.042
Let me the hell out of here!

59
00:03:42.167 --> 00:03:44.167
Stop the car!

60
00:03:54.292 --> 00:03:57.208
Help! Help!

61
00:03:57.333 --> 00:03:59.875
Somebody help me! Help!

62
00:04:00.042 --> 00:04:01.875
Help!

63
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.167
Help! Help!

67
00:04:33.875 --> 00:04:35.333
Hi.

68
00:04:38.708 --> 00:04:39.833
Hi.

69
00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.833
How's my favorite employee?

70
00:04:41.917 --> 00:04:43.375
Um. employees get paid. Dad.

71
00:04:43.542 --> 00:04:46.167
Even if they're just
the coffee runner.

72
00:04:46.333 --> 00:04:47.500
(chuckling)
Well. there's nothing wrong

73
00:04:47.625 --> 00:04:49.000
with gaining some experience.

74
00:04:49.125 --> 00:04:50.667
even if it is unpaid. right?

75
00:04:50.833 --> 00:04:52.000
(scoffing)

76
00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:53.542
All right. Oh. we got to go.

77
00:04:53.667 --> 00:04:55.333
I don't want to be late
for my test.

78
00:04:55.458 --> 00:04:57.667
Excuse me. since when
were you ever in a hurry

79
00:04:57.833 --> 00:04:59.167
to get back to school?

80
00:04:59.292 --> 00:05:02.125
Ever since Mom threatened
to extend my lockdown

81
00:05:02.208 --> 00:05:03.500
if I don't get straight B's.

82
00:05:03.625 --> 00:05:06.000
- Still grounded. huh?
- (Kimber scoffing)

83
00:05:06.167 --> 00:05:07.667
Complete lockdown's
more like it.

84
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.333
Try to take it easy
on your mother. okay?

85
00:05:10.417 --> 00:05:12.625
She's kind of going overboard
ever since...

86
00:05:14.625 --> 00:05:15.625
You know.

87
00:05:15.708 --> 00:05:18.333
Ever since
I almost got kidnapped.

88
00:05:18.458 --> 00:05:20.500
You can't you even
say the words.

89
00:05:20.667 --> 00:05:22.333
You're okay. though. right?

90
00:05:22.417 --> 00:05:23.917
You're better?

91
00:05:24.042 --> 00:05:25.667
That's my girl.

92
00:05:27.125 --> 00:05:29.667
Um. do me a favor.

93
00:05:29.792 --> 00:05:34.875
Would you please
put this in the safe for me?

94
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.458
You know. Dad.

95
00:05:36.583 --> 00:05:38.000
they invented this thing
called a bank

96
00:05:38.125 --> 00:05:39.167
to store your money in

97
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.500
(keypad beeping)

98
00:05:40.583 --> 00:05:42.000
Yeah. well.
I will take my chances

99
00:05:42.167 --> 00:05:44.000
with a good old-fashioned safe
any day.

100
00:05:44.125 --> 00:05:45.625
Kimber:
Okay.

101
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.667
And you're sure
you want to trust

102
00:05:47.792 --> 00:05:50.375
your delinquent teenage daughter
with the password?

103
00:05:51.542 --> 00:05:52.833
Hang on. I'm thinking.

104
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.125
I'm kidding!

105
00:05:54.208 --> 00:05:55.333
Honey. listen.

106
00:05:55.417 --> 00:05:57.000
I would trust you with anything.

107
00:05:57.167 --> 00:06:00.042
Okay. Well...

108
00:06:00.167 --> 00:06:02.708
- Let's go.
- Right.

109
00:06:02.875 --> 00:06:04.083
(car horns blaring)

110
00:06:13.708 --> 00:06:14.958
Paul:
Say hi to your mom for me.

111
00:06:15.042 --> 00:06:16.333
Sure.

112
00:06:16.417 --> 00:06:18.875
Okay. Oh. and. uh...

113
00:06:19.042 --> 00:06:21.458
ace that test.

114
00:06:24.875 --> 00:06:26.708
Bye.

115
00:06:40.458 --> 00:06:41.875
Teacher:
Miss McCann.

116
00:06:43.792 --> 00:06:45.375
A word with you in the hallway.

117
00:06:51.208 --> 00:06:52.500
Kimber:
Is there a problem?

118
00:06:52.625 --> 00:06:54.625
Can you explain these?

119
00:06:56.625 --> 00:06:58.625
Signatures from my friends.

120
00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.375
It's a worldwide custom.

121
00:07:05.917 --> 00:07:07.833
(sighing)

122
00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.917
Principal's office. Now.

123
00:07:12.917 --> 00:07:14.625
(sighing)

124
00:07:15.875 --> 00:07:17.750
Hi. Mom.

125
00:07:17.875 --> 00:07:21.000
That's Principal McCann when
you're sitting in that chair.

126
00:07:21.125 --> 00:07:24.000
Look. it was just one test.

127
00:07:24.125 --> 00:07:25.583
And I didn't mean to cheat.

128
00:07:25.708 --> 00:07:27.708
I wrote down the answers
as a joke.

129
00:07:27.875 --> 00:07:29.500
and then they wouldn't
wash off.

130
00:07:29.667 --> 00:07:32.333
You did?
Or your friend Everleigh did?

131
00:07:32.458 --> 00:07:33.958
I recognize her handwriting.

132
00:07:35.625 --> 00:07:37.500
Everleigh had nothing
to do with this.

133
00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:40.583
This isn't about one test.
Kimber.

134
00:07:40.708 --> 00:07:43.208
Your grades are dropping
across the board.

135
00:07:43.375 --> 00:07:45.333
Are you still even expecting
to graduate?

136
00:07:45.417 --> 00:07:47.042
What happened
to all of your plans?

137
00:07:47.167 --> 00:07:48.417
Plans change.

138
00:07:49.708 --> 00:07:51.000
I'm still gonna graduate.

139
00:07:51.083 --> 00:07:52.583
Well. I hope getting
into a good college

140
00:07:52.708 --> 00:07:54.250
wasn't part of those plans.

141
00:07:54.375 --> 00:07:57.667
because you're killing
any chance of that.

142
00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.583
Honey. what is going on
with you?

143
00:07:59.708 --> 00:08:01.042
Kimber:
I don't know.

144
00:08:01.208 --> 00:08:02.792
Maybe it has something
to do with the fact

145
00:08:02.875 --> 00:08:04.833
that you and Dad obliterated
our entire family unit

146
00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.042
last year.

147
00:08:06.167 --> 00:08:07.542
(sighing)

148
00:08:07.708 --> 00:08:09.917
There will come a time

149
00:08:10.042 --> 00:08:12.542
when you can no longer
blame every bad decision

150
00:08:12.708 --> 00:08:14.750
on your father and I
getting divorced.

151
00:08:14.875 --> 00:08:17.000
Are you talking to me
as my principal right now.

152
00:08:17.167 --> 00:08:18.583
or my mom?

153
00:08:18.708 --> 00:08:20.792
Shawna: If I was speaking to you
as your mom.

154
00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:23.917
this conversation would be going
very differently.

155
00:08:24.042 --> 00:08:26.000
I don't know how much trouble
I can get in.

156
00:08:26.125 --> 00:08:29.250
I have one working hand.
and I'm under your house arrest.

157
00:08:36.542 --> 00:08:38.333
Austin. Hi.

158
00:08:38.417 --> 00:08:39.792
Are you here to see my mom?

159
00:08:39.917 --> 00:08:41.792
Yeah. College applications help.

160
00:08:41.875 --> 00:08:44.792
Oh. be careful.
I think I set her off.

161
00:08:44.917 --> 00:08:46.250
Of course.

162
00:08:46.375 --> 00:08:47.875
- I'll see you later.
- Okay. bye.

163
00:08:53.417 --> 00:08:55.958
- (knocking)
- Hi. Principal McCann.

164
00:08:56.083 --> 00:08:57.292
Is now a good time?

165
00:08:57.375 --> 00:08:58.958
Of course. Austin.
Have a seat.

166
00:08:59.083 --> 00:09:00.250
Austin:
Okay.

167
00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:03.583
(Austin clearing throat)

168
00:09:05.375 --> 00:09:08.167
So. first. is everything
okay with Kimber?

169
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.500
Yes. Why wouldn't things be?

170
00:09:12.667 --> 00:09:14.000
Well. I might have
heard something

171
00:09:14.125 --> 00:09:15.750
about a test this morning.

172
00:09:15.875 --> 00:09:17.292
(laughing)

173
00:09:17.375 --> 00:09:19.000
You're a good kind. Austin.

174
00:09:19.125 --> 00:09:21.333
It must be quite the challenge
dating a girl

175
00:09:21.458 --> 00:09:23.250
who can't leave her house
outside of school.

176
00:09:23.375 --> 00:09:25.125
Honestly.
I completely understand you

177
00:09:25.208 --> 00:09:28.750
being a little overprotective.
especially after what happened.

178
00:09:28.875 --> 00:09:30.667
I know I'm still new
around here.

179
00:09:30.792 --> 00:09:33.917
but I just hope that I can prove
myself to you and to Kimber.

180
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.125
Now. let's talk college
applications. shall we?

181
00:09:40.542 --> 00:09:42.125
Um. well. actually.

182
00:09:42.208 --> 00:09:45.292
there was something that
I wanted to talk about first.

183
00:09:46.875 --> 00:09:47.958
Okay.

184
00:09:48.042 --> 00:09:49.792
Everleigh:
It's just one test.

185
00:09:49.875 --> 00:09:51.208
Big deal.

186
00:09:51.333 --> 00:09:53.167
Tell that to Principal Mom.

187
00:09:53.333 --> 00:09:55.625
I would. except she hates me.

188
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:57.417
- She doesn't hate you.
- Look. I get it.

189
00:09:57.542 --> 00:09:59.292
I'm a mom's worst nightmare.

190
00:09:59.375 --> 00:10:01.583
Complex morals
and a winning smile.

191
00:10:01.708 --> 00:10:04.333
and undying loyalty
to my besties.

192
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.958
Oh. my God.

193
00:10:07.083 --> 00:10:08.292
Ew.

194
00:10:08.375 --> 00:10:10.125
A prom-posal?

195
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:11.333
I'm gonna puke.

196
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.583
Austin:
So. what do you say?

197
00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.125
Austin!

198
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.417
Of course I'd love
to go with you.

199
00:10:20.542 --> 00:10:21.833
But my mom.

200
00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958
Well. that's already
taken care of.

201
00:10:24.042 --> 00:10:25.833
I didn't actually
need help with college.

202
00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.667
I just wanted to ask permission
to let me take you.

203
00:10:29.833 --> 00:10:31.708
Oh. you went behind my back?

204
00:10:33.208 --> 00:10:34.292
What'd she say?

205
00:10:34.417 --> 00:10:35.833
She said yes.

206
00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:40.000
Austin. you're amazing.

207
00:10:44.042 --> 00:10:47.083
Save it for prom night. you two.

208
00:10:47.208 --> 00:10:48.667
Okay.

209
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.167
- Well. I'll call you later?
- Kimber: Yeah.

210
00:10:50.333 --> 00:10:51.750
All right.

211
00:10:55.042 --> 00:10:56.292
Oh. my God!

212
00:10:59.333 --> 00:11:00.958
Ugh! People are staring at us.

213
00:11:01.042 --> 00:11:02.542
Hey. just because
your boyfriend

214
00:11:02.708 --> 00:11:04.792
didn't do anything special
for you...

215
00:11:04.875 --> 00:11:06.333
College guys
don't buy you flowers.

216
00:11:06.458 --> 00:11:08.250
They buy you weekend getaways.

217
00:11:08.375 --> 00:11:09.708
What? I thought you hadn't--

218
00:11:09.833 --> 00:11:11.667
We haven't. Not yet.

219
00:11:11.792 --> 00:11:13.083
Believe it or not.

220
00:11:13.208 --> 00:11:15.208
I do have a tiny bit
of self-control.

221
00:11:15.333 --> 00:11:16.875
- Oh.
- (laughing)

222
00:11:21.375 --> 00:11:23.042
(tires squealing)

223
00:11:24.208 --> 00:11:25.292
What is it?

224
00:11:26.458 --> 00:11:28.125
Uh. nothing.

225
00:11:29.208 --> 00:11:30.542
Just. the SUV.

226
00:11:30.708 --> 00:11:32.667
I thought it was...

227
00:11:34.708 --> 00:11:36.250
I thought you told me
you were over all that.

228
00:11:37.667 --> 00:11:39.125
I thought I was.

229
00:11:42.125 --> 00:11:44.208
I see you found
your prom invitation.

230
00:11:44.375 --> 00:11:46.000
So cute.

231
00:11:46.125 --> 00:11:48.167
I rest my case.

232
00:11:48.292 --> 00:11:50.417
You know. Austin asked me
what your favorite flower is

233
00:11:50.542 --> 00:11:52.292
so that he could get you
the right kind.

234
00:11:52.375 --> 00:11:53.542
You remembered?

235
00:11:53.667 --> 00:11:56.083
That's what best friends do.

236
00:11:56.208 --> 00:11:58.250
(laughing)
Let's go.

237
00:11:58.375 --> 00:12:00.167
Okay. Look. um...

238
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:01.667
I'll see you later. okay?

239
00:12:01.792 --> 00:12:04.333
Could I talk to you for a sec?

240
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.792
In private?

241
00:12:07.708 --> 00:12:09.750
Just hold these for a sec?

242
00:12:11.542 --> 00:12:12.583
Yeah.

243
00:12:12.708 --> 00:12:14.583
So...

244
00:12:14.708 --> 00:12:17.042
how's French class going?

245
00:12:18.625 --> 00:12:20.375
You wanted to talk
about French class?

246
00:12:23.083 --> 00:12:27.042
Listen. I know that we're not
as close as we once were.

247
00:12:27.208 --> 00:12:29.458
And that's fine.
People grow apart.

248
00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:34.125
Whatever.
It's just. I miss you.

249
00:12:35.542 --> 00:12:36.917
That's all.

250
00:12:38.208 --> 00:12:39.708
I miss you too.

251
00:12:40.833 --> 00:12:42.417
But. look. I've just been busy

252
00:12:42.542 --> 00:12:45.333
with helping my dad at work
and college applications.

253
00:12:45.458 --> 00:12:46.708
I know. I get it.

254
00:12:48.292 --> 00:12:51.250
Well. I should probably
be heading home.

255
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.125
I'll see you later. okay?

256
00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:55.917
Wait.

257
00:12:58.167 --> 00:13:00.125
Why don't you just
come to prom with us?

258
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:01.958
Prom?

259
00:13:02.042 --> 00:13:03.500
I don't even have a date.

260
00:13:05.708 --> 00:13:07.208
You could be my plus-two.

261
00:13:08.458 --> 00:13:09.625
It'll be a night to remember.

262
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.292
(both laughing)

263
00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:15.167
(sighing)

264
00:13:19.125 --> 00:13:21.375
Shawna:
Well. look at you!

265
00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.417
I haven't seen you
smile like that in a long time.

266
00:13:23.542 --> 00:13:24.667
I see teeth!

267
00:13:24.792 --> 00:13:26.375
(laughing)

268
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.167
Thanks. For trusting me.

269
00:13:29.292 --> 00:13:30.708
Well. thank Austin.

270
00:13:30.833 --> 00:13:32.708
He's the one who convinced me
to let you go.

271
00:13:32.875 --> 00:13:34.375
He promised to take
full responsibility

272
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:35.833
for your safe return.

273
00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:39.542
Is he supposed to be my date
or my chaperone?

274
00:13:39.708 --> 00:13:41.958
The best ones can be both.

275
00:13:42.042 --> 00:13:43.625
Now come on. let's go before
the stores close.

276
00:13:43.708 --> 00:13:45.000
Go where?

277
00:13:45.083 --> 00:13:46.708
I thought I'm still
on house arrest.

278
00:13:46.875 --> 00:13:49.500
To get you a prom dress.
of course.

279
00:13:49.625 --> 00:13:51.333
Got to find you
something to wear.

280
00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:54.000
Okay.

281
00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:55.875
- (laughing) Yay.
- Come on.

282
00:13:58.375 --> 00:14:00.333
(Shawna sighing)

283
00:14:19.417 --> 00:14:21.042
(phone ringing)

284
00:14:21.875 --> 00:14:23.500
(cell phone vibrating)

285
00:14:27.375 --> 00:14:28.875
(inhaling sharply)

286
00:14:32.375 --> 00:14:34.000
Shawna. everything okay?

287
00:14:34.083 --> 00:14:36.375
Shawna:
Everything's fine.

288
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.667
I wanted to talk to you about
Kimber. if you had a second.

289
00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:40.708
Uh. yeah.

290
00:14:40.875 --> 00:14:42.667
Is she in some sort of trouble?

291
00:14:42.792 --> 00:14:44.083
No. No.

292
00:14:44.208 --> 00:14:45.583
Well. yes. technically.

293
00:14:45.708 --> 00:14:47.625
but that's not why I'm calling.

294
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:50.167
I wanted your input
on something.

295
00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.000
My input? Wow.

296
00:14:52.125 --> 00:14:55.125
I can't remember the last time
you asked me for that.

297
00:14:55.208 --> 00:14:57.167
Shawna: I've decided
to let her go to prom.

298
00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:00.125
She's upstairs right now
trying on a dress.

299
00:15:00.208 --> 00:15:01.875
And here I was thinking
you were going to keep her

300
00:15:02.042 --> 00:15:04.583
under lock and key
until she turned 25.

301
00:15:04.708 --> 00:15:06.083
Shawna:
That was the plan.

302
00:15:06.208 --> 00:15:09.917
But I saw how unhappy
it was making her.

303
00:15:10.042 --> 00:15:12.375
Maybe it's time
we let her get back out there.

304
00:15:13.833 --> 00:15:15.000
Does she have a date?

305
00:15:15.167 --> 00:15:16.542
Shawna:
Not just any date.

306
00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:18.500
He's a really great kid.

307
00:15:18.667 --> 00:15:20.833
He's polite. he's responsible.

308
00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.917
His name's Austin.

309
00:15:23.042 --> 00:15:25.458
Paul: Well. that all
seems great to me.

310
00:15:25.583 --> 00:15:27.167
So you're onboard?

311
00:15:27.292 --> 00:15:29.667
I wanted her dad's opinion
on this.

312
00:15:29.792 --> 00:15:31.000
Don't you usually
work these things

313
00:15:31.125 --> 00:15:33.208
as a chaperone anyway?

314
00:15:33.333 --> 00:15:35.042
Yeah. I'll be checking bags
at the door.

315
00:15:35.167 --> 00:15:37.167
and making sure everyone's
dancing three feet apart.

316
00:15:39.125 --> 00:15:42.000
And I might have installed
a GPS tracking feature

317
00:15:42.083 --> 00:15:43.333
on Kimber's phone.

318
00:15:43.458 --> 00:15:45.458
you know. just in case
if she loses it.

319
00:15:45.542 --> 00:15:46.667
I can help her find it.

320
00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:48.000
Shawna!

321
00:15:48.083 --> 00:15:50.083
Shawna:
Paul. she's our daughter.

322
00:15:50.208 --> 00:15:51.625
And we almost lost her
two months ago.

323
00:15:51.708 --> 00:15:53.458
So safety trumps privacy.

324
00:15:55.917 --> 00:15:58.042
Paul:
I suppose you're right.

325
00:15:59.375 --> 00:16:01.500
Um...

326
00:16:01.625 --> 00:16:02.667
How are you doing?

327
00:16:02.833 --> 00:16:04.167
You okay?

328
00:16:05.917 --> 00:16:07.375
I'm good. Paul.

329
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.167
Yup. Doing all right.

330
00:16:09.292 --> 00:16:11.250
Listen. I'm going to send you
pictures from prom. okay?

331
00:16:11.375 --> 00:16:12.458
Keep you posted.

332
00:16:13.792 --> 00:16:16.167
Paul:
Okay. Um. thank you.

333
00:16:16.292 --> 00:16:18.417
Good luck.

334
00:16:18.542 --> 00:16:19.833
Okay.

335
00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:21.208
(phone beeping off)

336
00:16:24.625 --> 00:16:26.333
(sighing)

337
00:16:32.667 --> 00:16:34.333
(sighing)

338
00:16:42.375 --> 00:16:43.833
Shawna:
Kimber. how's it fit?

339
00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.417
You can come in. Mom.

340
00:16:49.042 --> 00:16:51.458
Shawna:
Oh! Baby!

341
00:16:51.583 --> 00:16:53.250
You look beautiful!

342
00:16:53.375 --> 00:16:55.292
- You really think so?
- Yeah.

343
00:16:55.417 --> 00:16:58.500
I think you're going to have
a wonderful night.

344
00:17:00.625 --> 00:17:02.167
(laughing)

345
00:17:03.542 --> 00:17:05.167
I like it.

346
00:17:19.083 --> 00:17:20.792
(Joan coughing and sniffling)

347
00:17:20.917 --> 00:17:22.458
(spraying)

348
00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:24.542
You okay?

349
00:17:26.167 --> 00:17:27.792
Yeah. it's just the hairspray.

350
00:17:27.917 --> 00:17:29.167
Ugh.

351
00:17:29.292 --> 00:17:30.458
It's like you're fog-bombing

352
00:17:30.583 --> 00:17:33.000
a wasp's nest in here.
Everleigh.

353
00:17:33.125 --> 00:17:35.000
We'll see who's laughing
when my hair is still perfect

354
00:17:35.125 --> 00:17:36.417
eight hours from now.

355
00:17:36.542 --> 00:17:38.917
I intend to get
a little bit messy.

356
00:17:39.042 --> 00:17:40.875
By the way.

357
00:17:41.042 --> 00:17:43.500
I asked Luke to grab us
a bottle for tonight.

358
00:17:43.625 --> 00:17:45.167
A bottle of what?

359
00:17:46.292 --> 00:17:48.500
- Booze?
- (scoffing)

360
00:17:48.625 --> 00:17:51.417
Well. aren't you the sweetest
thing. Flu-liet.

361
00:17:51.542 --> 00:17:53.500
What's Flu-liet?

362
00:17:53.625 --> 00:17:55.333
Freshman-year English.

363
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.875
Everyone had to read a scene
from Romeo & Juliet

364
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.333
out loud in class.

365
00:18:00.458 --> 00:18:01.875
I wasn't feeling well that day.

366
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.083
and I begged my mom
to let me stay home.

367
00:18:04.208 --> 00:18:05.833
(mock retching)

368
00:18:05.917 --> 00:18:09.250
To her credit. she did catch
most of it in her backpack.

369
00:18:09.375 --> 00:18:12.333
She's been calling me that
ever since.

370
00:18:12.458 --> 00:18:14.250
It's not like I'm the only one.

371
00:18:14.375 --> 00:18:16.667
It's a term of endearment.

372
00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.125
Okay. play nice tonight. guys.

373
00:18:18.208 --> 00:18:19.958
Austin went all out
getting this limo.

374
00:18:20.042 --> 00:18:21.875
Right. Play nice.

375
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.667
Got it.

376
00:18:23.792 --> 00:18:25.083
And as for the bottle.

377
00:18:25.208 --> 00:18:27.125
I told my mom
we'd stay out of trouble.

378
00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:29.667
And I intend
to keep that promise.

379
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:31.125
Lame.

380
00:18:31.208 --> 00:18:33.417
♪ Hotshot coming
for the crown I won ♪

381
00:18:33.542 --> 00:18:35.667
♪ Fix your face with that frown.
ironic ♪

382
00:18:35.792 --> 00:18:38.208
Oh. wait. you're just
a little bit crooked.

383
00:18:39.667 --> 00:18:41.042
- There.
- Thank you.

384
00:18:41.208 --> 00:18:42.875
Okay. kids. Group photo.

385
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.667
All right.

386
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:46.333
One. two. three.

387
00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:47.833
- (camera clicking)
- Yes!

388
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.708
How about one
of just Joan and I?

389
00:18:49.875 --> 00:18:51.833
Shawna:
Sure. Okay. Yes.

390
00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:53.792
That's great. Aw.

391
00:18:53.917 --> 00:18:56.500
I remember when you two
used to dress up as princesses.

392
00:18:56.625 --> 00:18:59.667
Now look at the both of you.
The real thing.

393
00:18:59.792 --> 00:19:01.500
Um. do you have it?

394
00:19:01.625 --> 00:19:02.750
Oh. yeah.

395
00:19:03.958 --> 00:19:05.458
Thanks.

396
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.583
Austin...

397
00:19:10.667 --> 00:19:13.000
- You've done so much.
- Austin: Aw.

398
00:19:13.125 --> 00:19:15.667
Kimber: I just wanted to show
my appreciation.

399
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.958
Oh. I love it.

400
00:19:18.042 --> 00:19:19.333
- (Kimber laughing)
- Thank you.

401
00:19:19.417 --> 00:19:20.583
Uh. Mom.

402
00:19:20.708 --> 00:19:21.833
Okay. okay. okay.

403
00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:22.958
Can I just get one more?

404
00:19:23.083 --> 00:19:24.417
Just the girls. though.

405
00:19:24.542 --> 00:19:25.875
- (laughing) Sorry. boys.
- Yeah. Yeah.

406
00:19:26.042 --> 00:19:27.750
- Okay. come.
- Okay.

407
00:19:27.875 --> 00:19:29.083
Okay. just line up right there.

408
00:19:29.208 --> 00:19:30.333
Hold on a minute.

409
00:19:30.458 --> 00:19:32.667
Going to take me some time.

410
00:19:32.833 --> 00:19:34.417
Oh! Hold on.

411
00:19:34.542 --> 00:19:35.833
(laughing)
Technology.

412
00:19:35.958 --> 00:19:38.417
Okay. Okay.

413
00:19:38.542 --> 00:19:39.833
Oh...

414
00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:41.208
Mommy's going to get it.
I'll get it.

415
00:19:41.333 --> 00:19:42.625
Okay. perfect.

416
00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:44.083
Sorry. excuse me.

417
00:19:44.208 --> 00:19:47.500
Uh. ladies and gentlemen.
our ride is here.

418
00:19:47.625 --> 00:19:49.458
- Joan: That's all just for us?
- Austin: Yeah.

419
00:19:49.542 --> 00:19:52.167
I wanted tonight
to be memorable.

420
00:19:52.292 --> 00:19:53.542
The best night of our lives.

421
00:19:59.042 --> 00:20:00.708
- Hi. Come on in.
- Driver: Hey.

422
00:20:01.875 --> 00:20:03.208
Hey. everybody.

423
00:20:03.333 --> 00:20:04.792
Uh. my name's Dan.

424
00:20:04.875 --> 00:20:07.292
I'll be your driver tonight.

425
00:20:07.375 --> 00:20:10.000
- Which one of you is Austin?
- That's me. Hello.

426
00:20:10.125 --> 00:20:12.542
Great. if you could
just sign there.

427
00:20:12.708 --> 00:20:15.500
Um. I'll take a moment
to explain the ground rules.

428
00:20:15.667 --> 00:20:18.083
One: no roughhousing
in the limousine.

429
00:20:18.208 --> 00:20:21.458
Heads and arms must remain
inside at all times.

430
00:20:21.542 --> 00:20:25.000
Two. any cleaning costs
will be added to the rental fee.

431
00:20:25.083 --> 00:20:27.083
And three.
no drugs or alcohol.

432
00:20:27.208 --> 00:20:28.583
(scoffing)

433
00:20:32.167 --> 00:20:34.667
Everyone ready for a great time?

434
00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:36.125
I mean. we were.

435
00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:38.167
- (laughing)
- Austin: So let's do it?

436
00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:39.708
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

437
00:20:39.833 --> 00:20:41.750
All right.

438
00:20:41.875 --> 00:20:43.208
Yay!

439
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:49.333
- Bye.
- Take good care of her. okay?

440
00:20:49.458 --> 00:20:51.083
Yes. You have my word.

441
00:20:51.208 --> 00:20:52.708
Ma'am.

442
00:21:01.458 --> 00:21:03.542
Shawna. let her have her fun.

443
00:21:03.667 --> 00:21:05.500
- (limo door closing)
- Let her have her fun.

444
00:21:15.292 --> 00:21:16.583
(ignition starting)

445
00:21:26.708 --> 00:21:27.792
Whoo!

446
00:21:27.917 --> 00:21:29.667
Yeah!

447
00:21:29.833 --> 00:21:32.500
Stop. We haven't even
popped off yet.

448
00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:34.208
and you've already breaking
rule number one.

449
00:21:34.333 --> 00:21:36.667
Just wait till you see
what I do to rule three.

450
00:21:36.792 --> 00:21:38.500
(chuckling)

451
00:21:38.625 --> 00:21:40.375
All right. where's the bottle?

452
00:21:42.833 --> 00:21:44.000
Oh. Yeah. Sorry. babe.

453
00:21:44.125 --> 00:21:45.500
I didn't have time to stop.

454
00:21:45.667 --> 00:21:47.208
Everleigh:
You're kidding me.

455
00:21:47.375 --> 00:21:48.750
I'm supposed to get through
tonight sober?

456
00:21:51.417 --> 00:21:53.625
Ugh! It's not even stocked.

457
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:55.833
Can't we still have
a good time without it?

458
00:21:55.958 --> 00:21:57.625
- Ugh!
- It's prom night.

459
00:21:57.708 --> 00:21:58.833
Joan's right.

460
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.792
Austin is the most amazing.

461
00:22:05.625 --> 00:22:07.333
- (static crackling loudly)
- (all groaning)

462
00:22:07.417 --> 00:22:08.750
Joan:
Sorry.

463
00:22:08.875 --> 00:22:11.833
Not a bad idea. Flu-liet.

464
00:22:15.542 --> 00:22:17.000
(hip-hop music playing)

465
00:22:17.125 --> 00:22:18.667
Much better.

466
00:22:19.875 --> 00:22:21.708
Ooh. what's this one do?

467
00:22:25.208 --> 00:22:26.792
Can I help you?

468
00:22:26.875 --> 00:22:29.125
Yes. it seems there's been
a terrible oversight.

469
00:22:29.208 --> 00:22:31.042
and someone forgot
to stock the minibar.

470
00:22:31.208 --> 00:22:33.708
We'll have to make a pit stop
at the closest corner store.

471
00:22:33.875 --> 00:22:35.583
Apologies for my friend.

472
00:22:35.708 --> 00:22:37.500
No need to make a pit stop.

473
00:22:37.625 --> 00:22:39.333
Driver: Let me know if there's
anything I can do

474
00:22:39.458 --> 00:22:41.333
to make your ride more
enjoyable.

475
00:22:46.958 --> 00:22:49.583
Austin: You know. you don't have
to hassle him like that.

476
00:22:49.708 --> 00:22:51.875
He's just trying
to keep us safe.

477
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.500
Don't be such a weenie.

478
00:22:53.625 --> 00:22:56.000
He's a chauffeur.
not our babysitter.

479
00:22:56.167 --> 00:22:57.750
No. it's not that. okay?

480
00:22:57.875 --> 00:22:59.458
It's actually this.

481
00:23:00.833 --> 00:23:02.958
Yeah. I just don't want
him to bust us.

482
00:23:03.083 --> 00:23:06.292
Since when were you so cool?

483
00:23:06.417 --> 00:23:08.500
You planned this?

484
00:23:08.583 --> 00:23:10.042
What about my mom?

485
00:23:10.208 --> 00:23:11.792
You promised.

486
00:23:11.917 --> 00:23:13.250
It's just a little taste.

487
00:23:13.375 --> 00:23:15.125
So we can have at least
one toast to celebrate.

488
00:23:17.042 --> 00:23:18.125
Are you mad at me?

489
00:23:18.208 --> 00:23:20.708
No. of course not.

490
00:23:20.875 --> 00:23:23.583
Okay. because. uh.
there's actually another thing.

491
00:23:23.708 --> 00:23:27.625
I arranged for one more
surprise along the way.

492
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:29.000
and we're headed there now.

493
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:32.250
I thought we were stopping

494
00:23:32.375 --> 00:23:34.042
for dinner reservations
before the school.

495
00:23:35.333 --> 00:23:37.208
A little change of plans.

496
00:23:37.375 --> 00:23:39.458
You're going to love it.

497
00:23:40.875 --> 00:23:42.833
All right. bottoms up.
everybody.

498
00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:46.667
To a night
we'll never forget.

499
00:23:46.792 --> 00:23:47.667
Cheers.

500
00:23:47.792 --> 00:23:52.875
♪ (man rapping indistinctly) ♪

501
00:24:03.833 --> 00:24:05.917
So. where exactly are we going?

502
00:24:07.208 --> 00:24:08.458
You'll see.

503
00:24:08.583 --> 00:24:10.375
I've got it all under control.

504
00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:11.625
We're not going
to be late. right?

505
00:24:11.708 --> 00:24:14.083
My mom's expecting us by eight.

506
00:24:14.208 --> 00:24:15.458
Come on. don't worry.

507
00:24:15.542 --> 00:24:16.708
She trusts me.

508
00:24:16.875 --> 00:24:18.958
You say that like she shouldn't.

509
00:24:20.625 --> 00:24:23.083
Just believe me.
I've planned for everything.

510
00:24:23.208 --> 00:24:24.542
We're almost there.

511
00:24:49.542 --> 00:24:51.750
Where are we?

512
00:24:51.875 --> 00:24:53.042
Uh. I thought.

513
00:24:53.208 --> 00:24:55.083
before we head to the big party.

514
00:24:55.208 --> 00:24:58.333
we could have our own
little party right here.

515
00:24:58.458 --> 00:25:00.167
Where we had our first date.

516
00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:01.542
(laughing)

517
00:25:01.708 --> 00:25:03.000
You know. to celebrate

518
00:25:03.125 --> 00:25:04.708
the beginning
of the rest of our lives.

519
00:25:06.458 --> 00:25:07.917
Austin.

520
00:25:08.042 --> 00:25:10.458
You're amazing.

521
00:25:13.208 --> 00:25:15.833
Let's party!

522
00:25:18.542 --> 00:25:19.875
Luke:
Yes.

523
00:25:21.375 --> 00:25:23.333
(laughing)

524
00:25:23.417 --> 00:25:25.625
That's what I'm talking about.

525
00:25:27.917 --> 00:25:29.000
One sec.

526
00:25:31.875 --> 00:25:33.167
Hey.

527
00:25:34.708 --> 00:25:36.667
Thanks for inviting me tonight.
Kimber.

528
00:25:36.792 --> 00:25:38.708
If it wasn't for you.

529
00:25:38.833 --> 00:25:41.917
I'd be sitting at home playing
backgammon with my grandparents.

530
00:25:42.042 --> 00:25:44.750
(laughing) You've always been
a really good friend.

531
00:25:45.875 --> 00:25:47.875
We were Girl Scouts together.

532
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.042
(laughing)

533
00:25:49.208 --> 00:25:50.875
I miss you.

534
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000
I feel like we don't even
get to see each other anymore.

535
00:25:56.833 --> 00:25:58.042
You sure you don't want a sip?

536
00:26:00.875 --> 00:26:02.417
Sometimes I wish
I could be more like her.

537
00:26:02.542 --> 00:26:04.208
(laughing)

538
00:26:04.333 --> 00:26:06.042
Maybe I'd see you more.

539
00:26:06.167 --> 00:26:07.375
Hey. that's not fair.

540
00:26:07.542 --> 00:26:08.833
We have a lot going on.

541
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.958
like school and college
applications...

542
00:26:12.083 --> 00:26:13.833
(laughing)

543
00:26:13.917 --> 00:26:17.000
'Tis a beautiful eve. m'dear.

544
00:26:17.083 --> 00:26:19.542
Why dost thou waste it
sitting down?

545
00:26:19.667 --> 00:26:21.708
- Now dip me.
- Okay. okay.

546
00:26:21.833 --> 00:26:23.333
See?

547
00:26:23.417 --> 00:26:25.000
I did pay attention
in English class.

548
00:26:25.125 --> 00:26:26.417
(Everleigh chuckling)

549
00:26:26.542 --> 00:26:27.833
Uh. may I?

550
00:26:27.958 --> 00:26:29.667
Okay.

551
00:26:29.792 --> 00:26:32.292
What's up with Flu-liet?

552
00:26:32.417 --> 00:26:33.917
Is she feeling sick again?

553
00:26:34.042 --> 00:26:35.875
Tell her I have some antacids
in my purse.

554
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Everleigh. don't call her
names like that.

555
00:26:38.167 --> 00:26:39.417
It's not nice.

556
00:26:39.542 --> 00:26:40.875
Fine. Whatever.

557
00:26:41.042 --> 00:26:42.542
I was getting tired
of this song anyways.

558
00:26:42.667 --> 00:26:45.333
Oh. Lukey!
Could you change the music

559
00:26:45.417 --> 00:26:47.042
to something
we could slow-dance to?

560
00:26:47.167 --> 00:26:48.417
That I can do.

561
00:26:48.542 --> 00:26:50.250
(mellow music playing)

562
00:26:50.375 --> 00:26:51.500
That's better.

563
00:26:51.625 --> 00:26:52.833

564
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.333

You're so thoughtful.

579
00:27:46.208 --> 00:27:47.875
It's all for you. Kimber.

580
00:27:53.167 --> 00:27:54.417
I love you.

581
00:27:58.208 --> 00:27:59.250

You two look adorable!

584
00:28:06.125 --> 00:28:10.250
Did I just witness
the first "I love you"?

585
00:28:10.375 --> 00:28:12.583
We have to have a picture
to commemorate the moment.

586
00:28:12.708 --> 00:28:14.000
Stop!

587
00:28:14.125 --> 00:28:16.667
No pictures.
Not with any alcohol visible.

588
00:28:16.792 --> 00:28:20.500
Dude. it's not a big deal.

589
00:28:20.625 --> 00:28:21.833
You're not the one
who gets busted

590
00:28:21.917 --> 00:28:24.167
if your parents find out.

591
00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:26.792
You think I don't know
you snuck a bottle in?

592
00:28:26.917 --> 00:28:29.000
Well. man. I'm 21.

593
00:28:29.125 --> 00:28:31.208
And still dating
high school girls.

594
00:28:31.333 --> 00:28:33.250
You should be proud.

595
00:28:33.375 --> 00:28:36.083
Come on. man. She's 18.

596
00:28:37.375 --> 00:28:39.167
Okay. everyone back in the car.

597
00:28:39.292 --> 00:28:40.333
I'm taking you home.

598
00:28:40.458 --> 00:28:43.292
What? No! You can't do that.

599
00:28:43.375 --> 00:28:44.625
You knew the rule.

600
00:28:44.708 --> 00:28:46.458
Austin:
Come on. please.

601
00:28:46.583 --> 00:28:48.375
You know. we're sorry. okay?

602
00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.333
It's all my fault.

603
00:28:50.417 --> 00:28:52.333
Is there anything we can do?

604
00:28:53.875 --> 00:28:56.042
I'll add it to the tip.

605
00:28:59.708 --> 00:29:02.833
Look. I can let you
have your fun...

606
00:29:04.292 --> 00:29:05.833
But you'll have to give up
your phones.

607
00:29:06.917 --> 00:29:08.667
You want our phones?

608
00:29:08.792 --> 00:29:10.667
I'd rather give up my spleen.

609
00:29:10.833 --> 00:29:12.417
That's the deal.

610
00:29:12.542 --> 00:29:14.458
No pictures. no phones.

611
00:29:14.542 --> 00:29:15.917
Not until I drop you off
at the prom.

612
00:29:16.042 --> 00:29:19.000
I'm not risking my job for you.

613
00:29:20.042 --> 00:29:21.833
Okay. maybe it's not so bad.

614
00:29:21.958 --> 00:29:23.375
It's just until
we get to the school.

615
00:29:25.167 --> 00:29:26.792
I'm with Kimber.

616
00:29:26.875 --> 00:29:28.375
Yeah. who needs them?

617
00:29:30.208 --> 00:29:31.375
No selfies?

618
00:29:32.667 --> 00:29:33.792
For real?

619
00:29:33.875 --> 00:29:36.792
What is this. the 1990s?

620
00:29:36.875 --> 00:29:38.833
Driver: I'll keep them
in the front with me.

621
00:29:38.958 --> 00:29:42.375
You can have them back
the second we get to the school.

622
00:29:48.375 --> 00:29:49.875
- You okay?
- Yeah.

623
00:29:57.167 --> 00:29:59.500
(sighing)

624
00:29:59.583 --> 00:30:00.708
Fine.

625
00:30:00.875 --> 00:30:02.250
I must be crazy.

626
00:30:03.708 --> 00:30:07.125
Just be careful with it. okay?

627
00:30:08.333 --> 00:30:09.875
I love it like a pet.

628
00:30:19.625 --> 00:30:21.375
I'm not drinking.

629
00:30:21.542 --> 00:30:24.083
And I don't even take selfies.

630
00:30:24.208 --> 00:30:25.333
You're here.

631
00:30:25.417 --> 00:30:27.042
You follow the rules
like everyone else.

632
00:30:36.917 --> 00:30:38.958
We'd better load up.

633
00:30:39.083 --> 00:30:40.417
It's a long drive to the school.

634
00:30:42.917 --> 00:30:44.417

Why would he go

somebody would try to kidnap me.

00:36:27.917 --> 00:36:30.417
Kimber: I'm more worried
about something else right now.

723
00:36:31.375 --> 00:36:33.167
Where he's taking us.

724
00:36:38.333 --> 00:36:40.500
Everleigh:
Open up and stop the car!

725
00:36:40.667 --> 00:36:42.375
(thumping)

726
00:36:50.875 --> 00:36:52.000
(mouse button clicking)

727
00:36:52.167 --> 00:36:53.583
(cell phone vibrating)

728
00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:57.792
(Paul sighing)

729
00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:06.167
What the hell?

730
00:37:12.208 --> 00:37:14.000
(phone ringing)

731
00:37:14.083 --> 00:37:15.292
Kimber on voicemail:
Hey. it's Kimber.

732
00:37:15.375 --> 00:37:17.583
Hang up and text me
like a sane person.

733
00:37:17.708 --> 00:37:18.917
Damn it. Kimber.

734
00:37:21.542 --> 00:37:24.167
Anyone got any guesses
where we're going?

735
00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:25.583
Or why?

736
00:37:28.333 --> 00:37:29.667
Dying on prom night.

737
00:37:29.792 --> 00:37:31.667
What a tragic cliché.

738
00:37:31.792 --> 00:37:33.167
Nobody's dying.

739
00:37:33.333 --> 00:37:35.417
Nobody's getting hurt.

740
00:37:35.542 --> 00:37:38.208
Luke: This guy went through
a lot of trouble to kidnap us.

741
00:37:38.375 --> 00:37:40.083
Doubt we're getting out of here
without a fight.

742
00:37:40.208 --> 00:37:41.458
You think we've been kidnapped?

743
00:37:41.542 --> 00:37:43.667
Probably for ransom.
Maybe worse.

744
00:37:43.792 --> 00:37:46.583
Hell. maybe for some big.
stupid prank.

745
00:37:46.708 --> 00:37:47.667
Whatever it is.

746
00:37:47.792 --> 00:37:49.250
we have to find a way
out of here

747
00:37:49.375 --> 00:37:52.000
before we get to where
this guy's going.

748
00:37:52.125 --> 00:37:53.500
- (grunting)
- What are you doing?

749
00:37:53.625 --> 00:37:55.000
Luke:
What's it look like. Tina Fey?

750
00:37:55.125 --> 00:37:56.500
Getting us the hell out of here.

751
00:37:58.958 --> 00:38:00.625
Anyone have a screwdriver?

752
00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:01.917
Wait.

753
00:38:03.375 --> 00:38:05.500
He could be watching us.

754
00:38:14.375 --> 00:38:16.500
Hey. how do you know
about this stuff?

755
00:38:16.625 --> 00:38:18.375
Took auto shop in high school.

756
00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:19.667
The only class I didn't hate.

757
00:38:19.792 --> 00:38:22.000
- Oh.
- Joan: Think you can open it?

758
00:38:23.083 --> 00:38:24.708
Maybe.

759
00:38:24.833 --> 00:38:27.333
Worth a shot.

760
00:38:27.458 --> 00:38:30.583
- But what if he stops again?
- We have to do something.

761
00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:32.833
Luke:
I found it!

762
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000
I just need something

763
00:38:34.083 --> 00:38:35.833
to loosen the screw.

764
00:38:35.958 --> 00:38:37.333
Kimber:
Oh.

765
00:38:38.208 --> 00:38:39.542
What about this?

766
00:38:41.875 --> 00:38:43.792
I was-- Well. I was going
to keep that.

767
00:38:43.875 --> 00:38:45.417
I'll buy you a new one.

768
00:38:48.708 --> 00:38:50.417
I never should have
come out tonight.

769
00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:53.750
I never belonged here
in the first place.

770
00:38:55.417 --> 00:38:57.000
It's going to be okay. Joan.

771
00:38:57.167 --> 00:38:59.500
Or maybe we all end up dead.

772
00:38:59.625 --> 00:39:01.333
Why do you always
have to do that. Everleigh?

773
00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:04.583
Take something sweet
and make it sour?

774
00:39:04.708 --> 00:39:08.000
At least I'm not the one riding
fifth wheel for my senior prom.

775
00:39:08.083 --> 00:39:11.333
Everleigh! Joan deserves to be
here just like everyone else.

776
00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:14.333
Really? Because that's not
what you told me the other day

777
00:39:14.458 --> 00:39:15.833
when your mother
made you invite her.

778
00:39:17.208 --> 00:39:18.542
Joan:
Is that true. Kimber?

779
00:39:20.458 --> 00:39:22.458
She may have suggested it.

780
00:39:22.583 --> 00:39:24.583
But I was going
to ask you anyways.

781
00:39:26.625 --> 00:39:29.708
Luke: If you girls are done.
I'm stuck.

782
00:39:29.833 --> 00:39:30.833
My hand's too big.

783
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.417
(sighing)

784
00:39:32.542 --> 00:39:34.583
Kimber. be careful.

785
00:39:36.458 --> 00:39:38.500
- What am I looking for?
- Okay. the wire for the lock

786
00:39:38.625 --> 00:39:40.000
should be right here
near the top.

787
00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:46.208
All right.
next time he makes a stop.

788
00:39:46.375 --> 00:39:47.750
we open the door.

789
00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:51.375
Then we make a run for it?

790
00:39:51.542 --> 00:40:01.500
♪

791
00:40:17.042 --> 00:40:19.500
(dance music playing)

792
00:40:25.042 --> 00:40:26.458
Sorry. Principal McCann.

793
00:40:26.583 --> 00:40:28.625
You're lucky
I'm in a good mood tonight.

794
00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:29.875
Go.

795
00:40:34.958 --> 00:40:36.542
(scoffing)

796
00:40:51.625 --> 00:40:53.417
(cell phone ringing)

797
00:41:01.917 --> 00:41:04.083
Paul? I wasn't expecting
to hear from you tonight.

798
00:41:04.208 --> 00:41:05.833
Is everything okay?

799
00:41:05.958 --> 00:41:09.167
You don't happen to be
with Kimber right now. do you?

800
00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:10.792
No. Why?

801
00:41:10.917 --> 00:41:13.000
She was supposed to be here
a half hour ago. though.

802
00:41:13.167 --> 00:41:17.292
Um. look. I'm going
to forward you a text. okay?

803
00:41:17.375 --> 00:41:19.083
So just check your messages.

804
00:41:19.208 --> 00:41:20.375
Shawna:
Okay. you're scaring me.

805
00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:21.958
Shawna. just check your message.

806
00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:31.792
What is this?

807
00:41:31.875 --> 00:41:33.375
Why would someone
send this to you?

808
00:41:33.542 --> 00:41:35.083
I don't know.
I just tried calling them back.

809
00:41:35.208 --> 00:41:36.333
but the line's dead.

810
00:41:36.417 --> 00:41:37.625
She promised me.

811
00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:39.083
That tracking app
you mentioned.

812
00:41:39.208 --> 00:41:40.833
is that working right now?

813
00:41:40.958 --> 00:41:43.125
Shawna: No. I was trying
to give her some privacy.

814
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:44.542
Hold on.

815
00:41:49.042 --> 00:41:50.708
Looks like she's
in the middle of nowhere.

816
00:41:50.833 --> 00:41:52.833
Paul: What about this boyfriend
in shining armor?

817
00:41:52.917 --> 00:41:54.667
Isn't he supposed
to be with her?

818
00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:56.458
Yeah. he's supposed to be.

819
00:41:56.542 --> 00:41:58.625
When I get my hands on him.
I swear...

820
00:41:58.708 --> 00:42:01.792
Shawna. you're the principal.
You can't do that.

821
00:42:01.875 --> 00:42:03.500
I'm the dad. That's my job.

822
00:42:04.417 --> 00:42:05.833
What was I thinking?

823
00:42:05.958 --> 00:42:07.833
She had me so convinced
I could trust her.

824
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.667
All right. look. we will
figure this out together.

825
00:42:11.792 --> 00:42:13.167
Okay? I'm on my way.

826
00:42:15.042 --> 00:42:16.167
(sighing)

827
00:42:29.792 --> 00:42:31.042
Kimber:
I'm getting it.

828
00:42:34.667 --> 00:42:36.042
Hey. will you switch with me?

829
00:42:36.208 --> 00:42:37.500
Yeah.

830
00:42:48.208 --> 00:42:49.792
Are we stopping?

831
00:42:50.792 --> 00:42:52.042
I can't tell where we are.

832
00:42:55.125 --> 00:42:56.625
(limo door closing)

833
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:59.667
- Quick. get the panel back on.
- I almost have it.

834
00:42:59.792 --> 00:43:01.208
Joan: He's here. Kimber.
There's no time.

835
00:43:13.333 --> 00:43:14.542
What are you doing?

836
00:43:15.875 --> 00:43:17.208
My boyfriend dropped
his boutonniere.

837
00:43:22.875 --> 00:43:25.333
Got tired of you
watching us. perv.

838
00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:28.083
Yeah. what are we.
your prisoners?

839
00:43:30.083 --> 00:43:31.375
You two.

840
00:43:31.542 --> 00:43:33.083
Out.

841
00:43:33.208 --> 00:43:34.417
Austin:
No.

842
00:43:34.542 --> 00:43:36.167
No. no. No one is going anywhere

843
00:43:36.292 --> 00:43:38.833
until you tell us
what the hell is going on.

844
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.167
I said out.

845
00:43:40.292 --> 00:43:41.333
- Hey!
- Leave her alone!

846
00:43:41.417 --> 00:43:42.625
(electricity crackling)

847
00:43:42.708 --> 00:43:44.083
(all screaming)

848
00:43:48.458 --> 00:43:50.000
You can cooperate...

849
00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:53.958
Or you can be incapacitated.

850
00:43:56.125 --> 00:43:57.292
Your choice.

851
00:43:57.417 --> 00:43:58.833
That's no choice.

852
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.417
Kimber:
Okay. I'll just go.

853
00:44:00.542 --> 00:44:01.958
Why does Joan have to?

854
00:44:02.083 --> 00:44:04.000
- Kimber. no!
- Driver: Both of you.

855
00:44:04.167 --> 00:44:06.125
Now.

856
00:44:10.167 --> 00:44:12.125
Now!

857
00:44:19.292 --> 00:44:20.625
Wait.

858
00:44:25.708 --> 00:44:28.042
This is my dad's building.
What are we doing here?

859
00:44:29.542 --> 00:44:31.500
I need you
to get something for me.

860
00:44:31.625 --> 00:44:33.167
I'm not getting anything
for you.

861
00:44:33.250 --> 00:44:35.417
not until you tell me
what's going on.

862
00:44:36.708 --> 00:44:38.458
You're brave. Kimber.

863
00:44:38.542 --> 00:44:40.625
but you're picking
the wrong time.

864
00:44:43.708 --> 00:44:45.250
I won't do it.

865
00:44:45.375 --> 00:44:47.167
Not until--

866
00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:49.042
Okay! Okay! Stop!

867
00:44:50.875 --> 00:44:52.167
Okay. I'll do it!

868
00:44:59.333 --> 00:45:01.042
This will all be over soon.

869
00:45:10.625 --> 00:45:13.333
I need you to go inside and open
your father's office safe.

870
00:45:15.792 --> 00:45:17.083
What safe?

871
00:45:21.250 --> 00:45:22.958
Don't play games. Kimber.

872
00:45:27.042 --> 00:45:28.667
How do you know
I know how to open it?

873
00:45:30.542 --> 00:45:32.500
Because your dad trusts you.

874
00:45:32.625 --> 00:45:34.292
Just like your mom.

875
00:45:34.417 --> 00:45:36.083
Just like your friends.

876
00:45:43.208 --> 00:45:46.250
It's locked. No outgoing calls.
except to my phone.

877
00:45:47.875 --> 00:45:49.375
I want you to call this number
right now.

878
00:45:52.333 --> 00:45:53.958
(cell phone ringing)

879
00:45:55.958 --> 00:45:58.833
You'll keep it on speaker
the entire time you're inside.

880
00:45:58.958 --> 00:46:00.583
If I hear whispering.

881
00:46:00.708 --> 00:46:03.875
I hear anything I don't like.

882
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.917
they'll find that limo
at the bottom of a lake

883
00:46:06.042 --> 00:46:07.875
filled with the corpses
of your friends.

884
00:46:08.833 --> 00:46:10.083
Are we clear?

885
00:46:14.208 --> 00:46:16.000
You have 10 minutes.
then I'm gone.

886
00:46:18.125 --> 00:46:19.958
But what happens when they find
the security footage

887
00:46:20.083 --> 00:46:22.958
of me breaking into my dad's
safe in a prom dress?

888
00:46:23.042 --> 00:46:26.000
You can worry about that when
you all wake up alive tomorrow.

889
00:46:28.375 --> 00:46:29.500
You have nine minutes.

890
00:46:40.583 --> 00:46:41.792
(keypad beeping)

891
00:46:41.875 --> 00:46:43.167
(lock clicking)

892
00:46:46.542 --> 00:46:48.167
Everleigh:
Austin? Austin?

893
00:46:48.292 --> 00:46:49.500
Austin!

894
00:46:49.625 --> 00:46:50.917
(groaning)

895
00:46:54.333 --> 00:46:55.375
Ow.

896
00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:56.625
What hit me?

897
00:46:56.708 --> 00:46:58.208
You got Tased.

898
00:46:58.375 --> 00:46:59.708
Are you okay?

899
00:46:59.833 --> 00:47:01.792
I mean. I think so.

900
00:47:04.042 --> 00:47:05.292
Is the door still locked?

901
00:47:05.375 --> 00:47:07.917
Yeah. well.
Kimber never got that screw.

902
00:47:14.292 --> 00:47:16.625
That probably
wouldn't have worked anyway.

903
00:47:16.708 --> 00:47:17.917
Yeah. well.
I think I almost got it.

904
00:47:18.042 --> 00:47:20.417
Look. when Ted Bundy
comes around

905
00:47:20.542 --> 00:47:22.083
and goes to the door...

906
00:47:23.542 --> 00:47:24.917
I'm gonna jump him.

907
00:47:26.542 --> 00:47:29.750
You know what?
Nah. that's too risky. man.

908
00:47:29.875 --> 00:47:32.333
And what about Kimber and Joan?

909
00:47:33.958 --> 00:47:35.625
We come back
with reinforcements.

910
00:47:35.708 --> 00:47:37.500
Cops. Parental figures.

911
00:47:43.375 --> 00:47:44.667
Damn it!

912
00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:46.167
(sighing)

913
00:47:46.292 --> 00:47:48.208
I'm not even close
on this thing.

914
00:47:51.708 --> 00:47:53.500
Okay. we're inside.

915
00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:56.917
(keypad beeping)

916
00:48:00.792 --> 00:48:02.375
(lock tumbling)

917
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:05.000
You need to look for a bag

918
00:48:05.125 --> 00:48:06.458
to put the money in.

919
00:48:06.583 --> 00:48:07.625
Driver:
Don't bother.

920
00:48:08.833 --> 00:48:10.292
If you don't want the money.

921
00:48:10.375 --> 00:48:11.792
then what do you want?

922
00:48:11.875 --> 00:48:13.250
Driver:
I want the thumb drive.

923
00:48:14.458 --> 00:48:16.125
Why? What's on it?

924
00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:17.833
Driver:
Five minutes. Kimber.

925
00:48:19.583 --> 00:48:20.833
(footsteps falling)

926
00:48:20.958 --> 00:48:22.250
Kimber!

927
00:48:30.333 --> 00:48:32.042
Driver:
What's wrong? What was that?

928
00:48:32.167 --> 00:48:33.917
I think someone's here.

929
00:48:34.042 --> 00:48:36.000
Driver: There's no one there.
I made sure of it.

930
00:48:36.083 --> 00:48:38.000
Well. I hate to break it
to you. but there is.

931
00:48:38.083 --> 00:48:40.375
(breathing heavily)

932
00:48:55.625 --> 00:48:57.250
Driver:
Two minutes. ladies.

933
00:48:59.625 --> 00:49:01.417
(pencil scratching)

934
00:49:13.625 --> 00:49:14.667
Kimber:
Wait.

935
00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:16.042
Hold on.

936
00:49:18.292 --> 00:49:19.542
Okay.

937
00:49:31.333 --> 00:49:33.125
The GPS says she's still
in the same spot

938
00:49:33.208 --> 00:49:36.292
she was three hours ago.

939
00:49:36.375 --> 00:49:38.542
Paul. do you think she'll hate
us if we come looking for her?

940
00:49:38.667 --> 00:49:41.375
This night was supposed
to be all about her.

941
00:49:41.542 --> 00:49:43.167
Shawna. we're not
accusing her of anything.

942
00:49:43.333 --> 00:49:45.583
We're just trying to figure out
if she's okay.

943
00:49:45.708 --> 00:49:47.333
I just have a bad feeling.

944
00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:49.667
I'm sure she's fine.

945
00:49:49.833 --> 00:49:51.042
Let's just go find her.

946
00:50:04.375 --> 00:50:12.958
♪

947
00:50:14.625 --> 00:50:16.500
We almost got caught.

948
00:50:16.625 --> 00:50:18.042
The janitor was there.

949
00:50:18.208 --> 00:50:21.167
- You weren't spotted.
- How do you know?

950
00:50:21.292 --> 00:50:23.833
Because this place would be
swarming with cops right now.

951
00:50:23.958 --> 00:50:25.667
and all your friends
would be dead.

952
00:50:26.875 --> 00:50:28.375
Now give me the drive.

953
00:50:29.625 --> 00:50:31.208
Not until you let them go.

954
00:50:34.333 --> 00:50:35.708
No.

955
00:50:35.833 --> 00:50:37.667
We did what you asked.

956
00:50:38.792 --> 00:50:40.125
Let them go.

957
00:50:41.083 --> 00:50:42.167
(gasps)

958
00:50:42.292 --> 00:50:44.708
Driver:
Give me the drive.

959
00:50:44.875 --> 00:50:46.667
and this will all be over soon.

960
00:50:48.708 --> 00:50:50.000
Okay.

961
00:50:51.125 --> 00:50:52.667
(spraying)

962
00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:54.333
Kimber. help!

963
00:50:54.458 --> 00:50:55.542
(grunting)

964
00:50:58.375 --> 00:51:01.000
Driver:
Kimber. give me the drive!

965
00:51:03.708 --> 00:51:05.417
Okay.

966
00:51:08.875 --> 00:51:11.292
Both of you. back in the car.

967
00:51:14.875 --> 00:51:16.542
Everleigh:
Be careful!

968
00:51:19.458 --> 00:51:20.583
(yelling)

969
00:51:24.042 --> 00:51:25.875
Everleigh! I got it.

970
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.292
Everleigh:
Luke!

971
00:51:27.375 --> 00:51:29.042
- (Luke gasping)
- (Everleigh screaming)

972
00:51:34.833 --> 00:51:36.250
Everleigh:
Luke!

973
00:51:36.375 --> 00:51:38.583
(panting and grunting)

974
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.708
Everyone back in the car!

975
00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:49.333
She dies next
if you don't get back in now.

976
00:51:51.542 --> 00:51:52.583
Phone.

977
00:52:02.458 --> 00:52:04.208
(panting)

978
00:52:17.875 --> 00:52:19.208
(grunting)

979
00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:51.750
(breathing heavily)

980
00:53:27.417 --> 00:53:28.750
(computer humming. beeping)

981
00:53:28.875 --> 00:53:30.167
Come on.

982
00:53:32.708 --> 00:53:33.833
Come on.

983
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:46.583
Yes.

984
00:53:46.708 --> 00:53:48.167
(sighing) Yes.

985
00:53:55.333 --> 00:53:56.750
(ignition starting)

986
00:53:56.875 --> 00:53:58.417
(limo chiming)

987
00:54:30.250 --> 00:54:32.208
(sirens blaring distantly)

988
00:54:36.792 --> 00:54:37.917
Paul:
Kimber?

989
00:54:39.167 --> 00:54:40.250
Kimber!

990
00:54:40.375 --> 00:54:42.000
Find anything?

991
00:54:42.083 --> 00:54:43.708
- Just that.
- (sighing)

992
00:54:43.875 --> 00:54:46.708
The GPS says they're still
right here. but where?

993
00:54:46.875 --> 00:54:49.750
They got to be
off in the woods somewhere.

994
00:54:49.875 --> 00:54:52.250
She's wearing a $400 prom dress.
Why would she go in the woods?

995
00:54:52.375 --> 00:54:53.958
I don't know.
You were a teenager once.

996
00:54:54.042 --> 00:54:55.292
Use your imagination.

997
00:54:55.375 --> 00:54:57.167
I'd really rather not.

998
00:54:57.250 --> 00:54:58.917
Kimber!

999
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.375
Kimber!

1000
00:55:06.333 --> 00:55:07.792
Kimber!

1001
00:55:10.708 --> 00:55:11.917
Paul?

1002
00:55:13.083 --> 00:55:14.667
This is her phone.

1003
00:55:14.792 --> 00:55:16.833
- Paul: It's what?
- This is her phone.

1004
00:55:16.917 --> 00:55:18.292
This is everybody's phone.

1005
00:55:19.208 --> 00:55:20.458
Where is our daughter?

1006
00:55:20.542 --> 00:55:22.000
Hey. we're gonna find her.

1007
00:55:22.083 --> 00:55:23.333
Where is she?

1008
00:55:23.417 --> 00:55:25.667
Who's calling me?

1009
00:55:25.792 --> 00:55:26.958
Who is it?

1010
00:55:27.083 --> 00:55:28.625
It's the office.

1011
00:55:28.708 --> 00:55:30.708
Paul McCann.

1012
00:55:30.833 --> 00:55:33.500
Mr. McCann.
it's Jacob at the office.

1013
00:55:33.667 --> 00:55:35.792
I think you need to get here
right away.

1014
00:55:35.875 --> 00:55:37.958
It's about your daughter.

1015
00:55:51.542 --> 00:55:53.292
Are you sure you're okay?

1016
00:55:54.958 --> 00:55:56.458
I'm fine.

1017
00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:59.458
I'm more worried about her.

1018
00:56:02.292 --> 00:56:04.708
Everleigh. I'm so sorry.

1019
00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:09.125
This thumb drive
he wanted you to steal.

1020
00:56:09.208 --> 00:56:11.000
what did it look like?

1021
00:56:11.083 --> 00:56:12.917
What does it matter?

1022
00:56:13.042 --> 00:56:14.833
Why is it worth Luke dying over?

1023
00:56:16.625 --> 00:56:18.875
It was just like any other
thumb drive. but different.

1024
00:56:20.542 --> 00:56:23.417
It had more buttons
and a screen.

1025
00:56:23.542 --> 00:56:25.333
Like a crypto wallet?

1026
00:56:25.458 --> 00:56:27.125
A what?

1027
00:56:27.208 --> 00:56:29.083
It's like a physical wallet.

1028
00:56:29.208 --> 00:56:31.125
only it holds access
to cryptocurrency.

1029
00:56:32.667 --> 00:56:34.292
What? Not all of us
have our parents

1030
00:56:34.375 --> 00:56:36.208
to pay our way through college.

1031
00:56:36.333 --> 00:56:37.833
I have been researching
alternatives.

1032
00:56:39.875 --> 00:56:41.833
Does that sound like something
your dad would be into?

1033
00:56:41.917 --> 00:56:44.500
Well. I know he didn't
trust banks.

1034
00:56:44.625 --> 00:56:47.750
So if he has the drive.
he has your dad's money.

1035
00:56:48.667 --> 00:56:50.042
He still needs the passcode.

1036
00:56:51.833 --> 00:56:54.500
Which explains why
he's holding all of us hostage.

1037
00:56:55.667 --> 00:56:56.750
Us?

1038
00:56:58.167 --> 00:57:00.000
He just needs you.
doesn't he?

1039
00:57:00.125 --> 00:57:02.125
What happens to the rest of us?

1040
00:57:03.792 --> 00:57:05.417
I just wish you could've
gotten that door open

1041
00:57:05.542 --> 00:57:07.833
while we were all inside.

1042
00:57:07.958 --> 00:57:09.750
Do you still think
you can get that screw out?

1043
00:57:09.875 --> 00:57:12.375
What do you mean?

1044
00:57:13.583 --> 00:57:15.375
I got it out. I gave it to...

1045
00:57:16.375 --> 00:57:18.125
What the hell?

1046
00:57:18.250 --> 00:57:20.375
Why didn't you tell us?

1047
00:57:22.792 --> 00:57:25.333
Well. I just had my nervous
system jump-started. okay?

1048
00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:27.500
And I wasn't about to abandon
Kimber and Joan.

1049
00:57:27.625 --> 00:57:30.417
That wasn't
your decision to make!

1050
00:57:32.375 --> 00:57:34.042
I'm just trying
to keep everyone safe.

1051
00:57:34.167 --> 00:57:35.833
Screw that!

1052
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.542
We could have had a chance
to escape.

1053
00:57:39.208 --> 00:57:40.542
Luke could have had a chance.

1054
00:57:41.583 --> 00:57:43.250
Joan:
Guys...

1055
00:57:43.375 --> 00:57:44.833
(breathing heavily)

1056
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.167
I think I'm having...

1057
00:57:47.250 --> 00:57:49.125
She's having an asthma attack.

1058
00:57:49.208 --> 00:57:50.333
- (coughing)
- Okay.

1059
00:57:50.458 --> 00:57:52.333
Okay. just take deep breaths.

1060
00:57:52.417 --> 00:57:53.667
Stay calm.

1061
00:57:53.833 --> 00:57:55.000
In and out.

1062
00:57:55.167 --> 00:57:57.000
(labored breathing)

1063
00:57:57.125 --> 00:57:58.333
I need my...

1064
00:57:58.417 --> 00:57:59.833
Kimber:
Hey!

1065
00:58:01.042 --> 00:58:02.708
We need that inhaler!

1066
00:58:30.333 --> 00:58:31.833
No. she can't answer her phone.

1067
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.042
because I found it abandoned
in the middle of the woods.

1068
00:58:34.208 --> 00:58:36.000
And now there's a hostage note.

1069
00:58:36.125 --> 00:58:38.542
Just send a detective here
right away.

1070
00:58:38.667 --> 00:58:41.000
Please hurry.

1071
00:58:41.125 --> 00:58:42.958
Any luck with that limo?

1072
00:58:43.042 --> 00:58:44.542
No response.

1073
00:58:44.667 --> 00:58:46.000
- Take a look at this.
- (mouse button clicking)

1074
00:58:46.125 --> 00:58:49.000
I didn't know
you had cameras in here.

1075
00:58:51.208 --> 00:58:52.750
Paul:
Oh. no. no.

1076
00:58:54.208 --> 00:58:55.333
Oh. no.

1077
00:58:55.458 --> 00:58:57.042
Paul?

1078
00:58:58.667 --> 00:59:00.250
(keypad beeping)

1079
00:59:04.875 --> 00:59:06.542
Shawna:
What is it? What'd they take?

1080
00:59:06.667 --> 00:59:08.375
Paul:
Oh. my God.

1081
00:59:08.542 --> 00:59:10.625
They didn't take the cash?

1082
00:59:11.542 --> 00:59:12.875
They. um...

1083
00:59:15.292 --> 00:59:16.875
(laughing)

1084
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.708
They. uh...

1085
00:59:18.833 --> 00:59:20.167
They took everything.

1086
00:59:23.208 --> 00:59:26.208
Shawna. they took everything
I've ever worked for.

1087
00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:46.500
(thumping on partition)

1088
00:59:46.667 --> 00:59:47.750
(breathing heavily)

1089
00:59:47.875 --> 00:59:49.750
Is she going to be okay?

1090
00:59:49.875 --> 00:59:52.333
Just try relaxing. Joan.

1091
00:59:52.417 --> 00:59:53.708
Try lying back.

1092
00:59:53.833 --> 00:59:56.167
No. Keep her standing up.

1093
00:59:56.250 --> 00:59:57.833
Please! I am begging you!

1094
00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:58.917
She's my friend.

1095
00:59:59.042 --> 01:00:00.958
She'll die without her inhaler!

1096
01:00:08.625 --> 01:00:09.958
Everleigh:
Breathe.

1097
01:00:11.292 --> 01:00:12.958
Thank you.

1098
01:00:16.375 --> 01:00:17.500
(inhaler hissing)

1099
01:00:17.583 --> 01:00:18.833
(sighing)

1100
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.125
(coughing)

1101
01:00:28.167 --> 01:00:29.833
Kimber:
Everleigh!

1102
01:00:31.458 --> 01:00:33.167
Everleigh!

1103
01:00:33.333 --> 01:00:34.875
I've got it! Pull!

1104
01:00:35.042 --> 01:00:36.083
Pull!

1105
01:00:38.208 --> 01:00:40.333
Give me the drive or I'll close
the partition on her throat!

1106
01:00:40.458 --> 01:00:41.833
Just give it to him!

1107
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.958
Everleigh:
There! Let her go!

1108
01:00:49.333 --> 01:00:51.625
(yelling)

1109
01:00:55.958 --> 01:00:57.792
I can't get
her contact list open.

1110
01:00:57.917 --> 01:00:59.208
I don't know who to call next.

1111
01:00:59.375 --> 01:01:01.000
Um. Shawna. I. uh...

1112
01:01:02.958 --> 01:01:04.833
This is not the best time.
but there's something

1113
01:01:04.958 --> 01:01:07.250
I've been meaning to tell you
for a while now.

1114
01:01:09.208 --> 01:01:10.500
Okay.

1115
01:01:10.583 --> 01:01:12.208
After our divorce was finalized.

1116
01:01:12.375 --> 01:01:14.417
I got my annual physical.

1117
01:01:14.542 --> 01:01:17.583
and my lab results came back

1118
01:01:17.708 --> 01:01:20.500
with some abnormalities.

1119
01:01:20.625 --> 01:01:23.208
So I saw a couple specialists.

1120
01:01:23.333 --> 01:01:25.917
It turns out that I have cancer.

1121
01:01:26.042 --> 01:01:27.625
Prostate cancer.

1122
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:29.042
Why didn't you tell me?

1123
01:01:29.167 --> 01:01:31.000
I didn't want to worry you
or Kimber.

1124
01:01:31.083 --> 01:01:34.000
and my doctor
is very optimistic.

1125
01:01:34.125 --> 01:01:37.208
And with everything
we've been doing.

1126
01:01:37.375 --> 01:01:39.833
so far so good.

1127
01:01:39.958 --> 01:01:43.125
Paul. you should've told us.

1128
01:01:43.208 --> 01:01:45.292
We could have helped.

1129
01:01:45.375 --> 01:01:46.875
Well. look.

1130
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.292
things have been
kind of strained

1131
01:01:48.417 --> 01:01:50.000
between you and I for a while.

1132
01:01:50.125 --> 01:01:52.667
Um. the whole family. really.

1133
01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:56.083
And. uh. I just didn't want
to add to that.

1134
01:01:59.292 --> 01:02:01.167
It took two of us to let things
get as bad as they did.

1135
01:02:01.292 --> 01:02:03.417
- (Paul laughing)
- I'm as guilty as you are.

1136
01:02:03.542 --> 01:02:06.458
Well. I don't think so.

1137
01:02:06.583 --> 01:02:10.167
But. uh.
thank you for saying that.

1138
01:02:12.875 --> 01:02:14.167
(knocking on window)

1139
01:02:14.292 --> 01:02:16.667
- Hi. Detective Gosselin.
- Paul: Hi.

1140
01:02:16.750 --> 01:02:18.583
- You're Paul?
- Paul: Yes.

1141
01:02:18.708 --> 01:02:20.458
And Shawna.

1142
01:02:20.583 --> 01:02:22.958
You called about a missing teen?

1143
01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:33.667
You okay?

1144
01:02:33.792 --> 01:02:35.250
We stopped.

1145
01:02:36.458 --> 01:02:38.333
Because we pissed him off.

1146
01:02:38.458 --> 01:02:41.000
We saw what he did to Luke.

1147
01:02:41.125 --> 01:02:42.625
It could be any of us next.

1148
01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:44.292
When he opens the door.
we have to fight.

1149
01:02:44.417 --> 01:02:45.833
We don't have a choice.

1150
01:02:45.917 --> 01:02:47.667
Austin: Look. I messed
things up. all right?

1151
01:02:47.792 --> 01:02:49.708
Just let me fix this. okay?

1152
01:02:53.458 --> 01:02:55.625
(car alarm chirping)

1153
01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:57.125
Kimber:
Austin!

1154
01:02:59.125 --> 01:03:00.333
Austin!

1155
01:03:00.458 --> 01:03:01.875
Austin:
See?

1156
01:03:07.792 --> 01:03:08.875
- Austin?
- Hold on.

1157
01:03:09.042 --> 01:03:10.542
I'm gonna get us out of here.

1158
01:03:10.667 --> 01:03:11.875
Where'd the driver go?

1159
01:03:14.625 --> 01:03:16.208
Kimber:
Stop!

1160
01:03:16.333 --> 01:03:18.000
Stop it! Austin!

1161
01:03:18.167 --> 01:03:19.750
Austin!

1162
01:03:22.292 --> 01:03:23.750
Austin!

1163
01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:26.875
Austin!

1164
01:03:28.417 --> 01:03:30.000
Austin!

1165
01:03:31.875 --> 01:03:34.000
Where's Austin?
What did you do to him?

1166
01:03:35.083 --> 01:03:36.375
He wasn't good enough for you.

1167
01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:39.292
You'll understand that one day.

1168
01:03:43.042 --> 01:03:44.417
Anyone else feeling brave?

1169
01:03:44.542 --> 01:03:46.208
What about you?

1170
01:03:46.375 --> 01:03:48.042
Leave her alone!

1171
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:53.833
(crying)

1172
01:03:53.917 --> 01:03:55.208
Don't cry.

1173
01:03:56.667 --> 01:03:57.833
You're too beautiful to cry.

1174
01:03:57.917 --> 01:03:59.583
Don't touch me!

1175
01:03:59.708 --> 01:04:00.917
(vehicle approaching)

1176
01:04:01.042 --> 01:04:02.958
(police sirens blurting)

1177
01:04:03.083 --> 01:04:05.042
Don't say anything.

1178
01:04:05.167 --> 01:04:06.917
or you'll end up
like the guys.

1179
01:04:17.083 --> 01:04:19.083
- Evening. officer.
- Evening.

1180
01:04:20.042 --> 01:04:21.583
Everything all right?

1181
01:04:21.708 --> 01:04:23.708
Oh. yeah. Of course.
We're all fine.

1182
01:04:23.875 --> 01:04:25.958
Just. uh. stopped
to stretch my legs.

1183
01:04:27.208 --> 01:04:29.208
It's been a very busy night.

1184
01:04:32.042 --> 01:04:33.833
I think I know
what's going on here.

1185
01:04:33.958 --> 01:04:35.125
What do you mean?

1186
01:04:35.208 --> 01:04:37.083
It's prom tonight. isn't it?

1187
01:04:37.208 --> 01:04:39.417
No shenanigans going on.
I hope?

1188
01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:40.917
Everyone behaving themselves?

1189
01:04:42.833 --> 01:04:44.417
The truth is. officer.

1190
01:04:44.542 --> 01:04:46.667
one of my passengers had a bit
too much to drink tonight.

1191
01:04:46.792 --> 01:04:48.000
- Oh.
- I had to pull over

1192
01:04:48.167 --> 01:04:49.500
just so I didn't
get my seats stained.

1193
01:04:49.667 --> 01:04:50.875
Ugh.

1194
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.292
We were just heading out.

1195
01:04:52.417 --> 01:04:53.667
God. I swear.

1196
01:04:53.792 --> 01:04:55.333
every year the kids
get a little bit wilder.

1197
01:04:55.417 --> 01:04:56.708
May I?

1198
01:04:56.833 --> 01:04:58.000
Uh. sure.

1199
01:04:58.125 --> 01:04:59.375
Scare 'em straight.

1200
01:05:04.583 --> 01:05:06.250
Everybody okay in here?

1201
01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:12.250
You sure you're okay.
young lady?

1202
01:05:15.542 --> 01:05:16.958
Well. uh...

1203
01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:20.125
You kids have a good night.

1204
01:05:25.083 --> 01:05:27.250
Make sure you get these kids
home safe. okay?

1205
01:05:27.375 --> 01:05:28.417
Of course.

1206
01:05:32.792 --> 01:05:34.542
- (grunting)
- (Taser crackling)

1207
01:05:40.333 --> 01:05:42.208
(grunting)

1208
01:05:42.375 --> 01:05:43.417
(all gasping)

1209
01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.667
We have to run. Now!

1210
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:49.292
No! He'll kill us!

1211
01:05:57.458 --> 01:05:58.917
(yelling)

1212
01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:02.042
I told you to cooperate!

1213
01:06:04.208 --> 01:06:07.917
Blood is on your hands.

1214
01:06:25.667 --> 01:06:27.333
(police radio squawking)

1215
01:06:36.708 --> 01:06:38.333
(dog barking distantly)

1216
01:07:27.708 --> 01:07:29.625
(police sirens blaring)

1217
01:07:35.417 --> 01:07:37.083
Gosselin:
All right. so she was out

1218
01:07:37.208 --> 01:07:39.417
with four of her friends.
headed to prom?

1219
01:07:39.542 --> 01:07:41.250
Yes. They rented a limo.

1220
01:07:41.375 --> 01:07:43.625
We tried contacting the company.
but got no response.

1221
01:07:43.708 --> 01:07:46.750
Yeah. Look. Kimber would never
leave her phone behind.

1222
01:07:46.875 --> 01:07:48.500
I don't think any of them would.

1223
01:07:48.667 --> 01:07:51.167
So obviously. something's
happened to them. right?

1224
01:07:51.292 --> 01:07:53.750
I mean. kids can get a bit wild
on a night like tonight.

1225
01:07:53.875 --> 01:07:56.375
My daughter is in danger.

1226
01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:59.000
Just asking questions. ma'am.

1227
01:07:59.083 --> 01:08:00.792
Show him the video.

1228
01:08:00.875 --> 01:08:02.167
Yeah.

1229
01:08:05.333 --> 01:08:07.292
Take a look at this.

1230
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.333
Has your daughter ever been
in trouble like this before?

1231
01:08:12.458 --> 01:08:14.125
Shawna:
No. Kimber is a good kid.

1232
01:08:14.250 --> 01:08:15.417
She wouldn't be doing
any of this

1233
01:08:15.542 --> 01:08:17.167
if someone
wasn't forcing her to.

1234
01:08:17.292 --> 01:08:19.125
Hey. look at the note.

1235
01:08:19.250 --> 01:08:21.583
Obviously she is being
held hostage.

1236
01:08:24.750 --> 01:08:25.958
All right.

1237
01:08:26.083 --> 01:08:27.500
Tell me more
about this boyfriend

1238
01:08:27.667 --> 01:08:29.583
she's out with. Austin?

1239
01:08:38.375 --> 01:08:39.625
Kimber:
He killed him.

1240
01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:43.208
He just killed him.

1241
01:08:45.208 --> 01:08:47.458
Joan:
I'm so sorry. Kimber.

1242
01:08:47.542 --> 01:08:48.542
Austin was--

1243
01:08:48.667 --> 01:08:50.708
Kimber:
He died trying to save us.

1244
01:08:52.708 --> 01:08:53.750
Just like Luke.

1245
01:09:00.292 --> 01:09:02.750
What are you going
to do to her?

1246
01:09:04.583 --> 01:09:06.375
Please get out of the car.
Kimber.

1247
01:09:08.417 --> 01:09:09.625
Now.

1248
01:09:34.875 --> 01:09:37.250
Sit. Sit!

1249
01:09:50.583 --> 01:09:52.375
Are you going to kill me now?

1250
01:09:53.375 --> 01:09:54.750
Austin:
No.

1251
01:09:54.875 --> 01:09:56.667
No one else has to die.

1252
01:09:58.542 --> 01:09:59.625
Austin?

1253
01:09:59.708 --> 01:10:00.833
You're alive!

1254
01:10:04.125 --> 01:10:05.833
(sighing)

1255
01:10:06.917 --> 01:10:08.708
I don't understand.

1256
01:10:10.875 --> 01:10:12.167
You're with him?

1257
01:10:13.667 --> 01:10:15.792
Austin: Well. someone had
to keep an eye on you.

1258
01:10:15.875 --> 01:10:17.667
make sure you all behaved.

1259
01:10:17.833 --> 01:10:20.708
Make sure my brother here
didn't lose his nerve.

1260
01:10:22.750 --> 01:10:23.833
Brother?

1261
01:10:28.708 --> 01:10:32.000
Why do you think
I started dating you?

1262
01:10:32.083 --> 01:10:33.542
Earning your trust?

1263
01:10:35.125 --> 01:10:37.208
It was all leading here.

1264
01:10:41.875 --> 01:10:43.458
Why?

1265
01:10:45.417 --> 01:10:48.000
What do you want?

1266
01:10:48.083 --> 01:10:50.333
Who are you. Austin?
What is this?

1267
01:10:51.583 --> 01:10:53.875
This is the day
the truth comes out.

1268
01:10:55.375 --> 01:10:57.458
The day Paul McCann

1269
01:10:57.583 --> 01:11:01.333
finally faces the consequences
of his actions.

1270
01:11:02.292 --> 01:11:03.625
My dad?

1271
01:11:05.625 --> 01:11:07.875
What does my dad have to do
with any of this?

1272
01:11:09.792 --> 01:11:10.875
Everything.

1273
01:11:26.375 --> 01:11:28.125
Play that from the beginning
again. Paul.

1274
01:11:28.208 --> 01:11:29.375
Yeah.

1275
01:11:29.542 --> 01:11:30.667
(mouse button clicking)

1276
01:11:30.833 --> 01:11:32.875
(cell phone ringing)

1277
01:11:36.542 --> 01:11:38.000
It's a video message
from the same number

1278
01:11:38.125 --> 01:11:39.792
that sent me the last one.

1279
01:11:41.583 --> 01:11:43.667
(cell phone continues ringing)

1280
01:11:44.833 --> 01:11:45.917
Who the hell is this?

1281
01:11:49.042 --> 01:11:50.583
Hello. Principal McCann.

1282
01:11:50.708 --> 01:11:53.625
Austin? Where are you?
Where's Kimber? Is she okay?

1283
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:57.833
I promised Kimber
a night to remember.

1284
01:11:57.917 --> 01:11:59.958
And I think
I've kept that promise.

1285
01:12:02.458 --> 01:12:04.625
Austin. what's going on?

1286
01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:06.958
- Kimber: Mom! Dad!
- Driver: Hey!

1287
01:12:07.083 --> 01:12:08.208
Hey. hey. hey.

1288
01:12:08.375 --> 01:12:10.792
I swear to God.
if you hurt her. I--

1289
01:12:10.875 --> 01:12:11.958
Save your threats. Paul!

1290
01:12:13.333 --> 01:12:15.500
You're the reason she's here.

1291
01:12:15.625 --> 01:12:17.708
So if you do what's right.
she lives.

1292
01:12:18.875 --> 01:12:20.000
What?

1293
01:12:20.125 --> 01:12:21.375
Who are you?

1294
01:12:30.208 --> 01:12:31.583
Grace?

1295
01:12:33.042 --> 01:12:34.292
Grace Adams.

1296
01:12:39.458 --> 01:12:40.708
You remembered.

1297
01:12:44.042 --> 01:12:45.667
You're her son?

1298
01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:54.042
Well...

1299
01:12:54.208 --> 01:12:55.458
sons. actually.

1300
01:12:59.125 --> 01:13:00.875
Dad. what's he talking about?

1301
01:13:02.833 --> 01:13:05.750
- Paul. who's Grace Adams?
- (stammering)

1302
01:13:14.958 --> 01:13:16.000
(crickets chirping)

1303
01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Well. are you going to explain.
Paul. or should I?

1304
01:13:24.125 --> 01:13:25.583
Paul:
What is it you want?

1305
01:13:25.708 --> 01:13:27.750
You want money? This is about--
You want my money?

1306
01:13:27.875 --> 01:13:29.625
Austin:
I want exactly two things. Paul.

1307
01:13:31.208 --> 01:13:33.958
I want the passcode
to the crypto wallet I stole.

1308
01:13:34.042 --> 01:13:37.833
and I want you to finally
tell your family the truth.

1309
01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.375
Shawna:
Paul? What?

1310
01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:44.167
Shortly before we divorced...

1311
01:13:44.292 --> 01:13:45.750
I told you about that affair.

1312
01:13:45.875 --> 01:13:48.500
Um. well. it was more
than an affair.

1313
01:13:48.667 --> 01:13:50.000
Her name was Grace.

1314
01:13:51.167 --> 01:13:52.667
No. tell her what happened.

1315
01:13:55.375 --> 01:13:57.417
Paul:
I ended things with Grace.

1316
01:13:57.542 --> 01:14:00.500
and not long after that.
she died.

1317
01:14:00.625 --> 01:14:01.833
No. she didn't. Paul!

1318
01:14:01.958 --> 01:14:04.000
My mother didn't die.
You killed her!

1319
01:14:04.125 --> 01:14:06.000
No. no. no. no.

1320
01:14:06.125 --> 01:14:08.458
She died from an overdose.

1321
01:14:08.542 --> 01:14:09.917
That was not my fault. okay?

1322
01:14:10.042 --> 01:14:13.292
She had demons
way before I met her. okay?

1323
01:14:13.417 --> 01:14:14.833
I tried to help her.

1324
01:14:14.958 --> 01:14:17.000
Help her?

1325
01:14:17.125 --> 01:14:18.667
You abandoned her.

1326
01:14:20.375 --> 01:14:22.083
You lied to her
about your family.

1327
01:14:22.208 --> 01:14:23.875
and that betrayal killed her.

1328
01:14:24.042 --> 01:14:25.167
Paul:
No. no. no. I...

1329
01:14:25.292 --> 01:14:27.000
I told her it was a fling.

1330
01:14:27.167 --> 01:14:29.042
and she knew that.

1331
01:14:29.167 --> 01:14:30.583
You told her you loved her.

1332
01:14:30.708 --> 01:14:32.292
So you want money?

1333
01:14:32.375 --> 01:14:33.958
Paul doesn't even
have that much money.

1334
01:14:34.042 --> 01:14:36.208
So you've been lying
about that too. Paul?

1335
01:14:37.292 --> 01:14:38.833
All that money.

1336
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.583
Money that could have paid
for therapy.

1337
01:14:41.708 --> 01:14:44.583
Money that could have
paid for medication.

1338
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.792
Money that could have
saved my mom.

1339
01:14:47.875 --> 01:14:50.000
- What?
- Austin: No. go on.

1340
01:14:50.083 --> 01:14:52.000
Tell her how much
you're really worth.

1341
01:14:53.958 --> 01:14:55.250
Paul:
Millions.

1342
01:14:55.375 --> 01:14:57.208
I'm worth millions.

1343
01:15:03.917 --> 01:15:05.667
Now. Paul.

1344
01:15:05.833 --> 01:15:07.333
you'll give me access
to those millions.

1345
01:15:07.417 --> 01:15:09.458
No. no. no. stop. Okay. stop!
Okay. okay!

1346
01:15:09.583 --> 01:15:11.000
I will give you the code.

1347
01:15:12.875 --> 01:15:14.875
(sobbing softly)

1348
01:15:15.042 --> 01:15:16.125
I'm ready.

1349
01:15:19.125 --> 01:15:23.167
51227924.

1350
01:15:23.292 --> 01:15:24.750
(beeping)

1351
01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.500
(computer beeping)

1352
01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.667
Pleasure doing business
with you. Paul.

1353
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:43.208
Paul:
No. no. wait! Hey!

1354
01:15:43.333 --> 01:15:44.750
What about Kimber?

1355
01:15:48.958 --> 01:15:50.833
I need backup
on the scene. ASAP.

1356
01:15:50.958 --> 01:15:53.125
Shawna. Shawna.

1357
01:15:54.375 --> 01:15:55.500
When I got my diagnosis.

1358
01:15:55.625 --> 01:15:57.833
I was so scared

1359
01:15:57.958 --> 01:16:00.583
that I would leave you guys
with nothing.

1360
01:16:00.708 --> 01:16:03.333
So I got aggressive
with my investments.

1361
01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:04.583
and it paid off.

1362
01:16:04.708 --> 01:16:07.125
It paid off big-time.

1363
01:16:07.208 --> 01:16:08.375
Okay?

1364
01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:10.333
So that money is meant

1365
01:16:10.458 --> 01:16:12.042
for you and Kimber.

1366
01:16:13.542 --> 01:16:14.750
If anything happens
to her. Paul.

1367
01:16:14.875 --> 01:16:16.875
I swear I will
never forgive you.

1368
01:16:17.042 --> 01:16:19.208
Do you hear me?
I will never forgive you!

1369
01:16:26.292 --> 01:16:28.000
(computer beeping)

1370
01:16:28.167 --> 01:16:29.208
What are you doing?

1371
01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:32.542
Making a deposit.

1372
01:16:34.542 --> 01:16:36.208
Courtesy of your dad.

1373
01:16:36.375 --> 01:16:38.333
(laughing)

1374
01:16:38.458 --> 01:16:39.958
I grieved for you.

1375
01:16:42.375 --> 01:16:43.958
I thought you were dead.

1376
01:16:47.292 --> 01:16:48.708
You said you loved me.

1377
01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.583
Austin:
I really do like you. Kimber.

1378
01:16:54.583 --> 01:16:56.000
I think you're a great girl.

1379
01:16:56.125 --> 01:16:59.125
It's just your bloodline
that sucks.

1380
01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:03.708
- (computer stops beeping)
- Let's load up.

1381
01:17:07.333 --> 01:17:09.042
- Got that?
- Yeah.

1382
01:17:09.208 --> 01:17:11.167
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1383
01:17:11.292 --> 01:17:12.708
Austin:
All right.

1384
01:17:29.458 --> 01:17:32.000
(door opening and closing)

1385
01:17:37.458 --> 01:17:39.000
(grunting)

1386
01:17:49.833 --> 01:17:51.250
(car alarm chirping)

1387
01:17:54.375 --> 01:17:56.375
Kimber. Kimber!

1388
01:17:56.542 --> 01:17:58.083
Shh! They're just outside.

1389
01:17:58.208 --> 01:17:59.750
- Everleigh: "They"?
- Austin and the driver.

1390
01:17:59.875 --> 01:18:01.333
They're working together.

1391
01:18:01.458 --> 01:18:04.042
What? Why? How?

1392
01:18:05.208 --> 01:18:06.500
No. Just leave me here.

1393
01:18:06.667 --> 01:18:08.250
You have to make a run for it.

1394
01:18:08.375 --> 01:18:10.375
- No way. You're coming too.
- There's nowhere to go.

1395
01:18:10.542 --> 01:18:11.958
We're in the middle of nowhere.

1396
01:18:12.083 --> 01:18:13.542
But he doesn't know
you're free yet. okay?

1397
01:18:13.708 --> 01:18:15.542
So just leave me here and go.

1398
01:18:15.667 --> 01:18:17.083
Joan:
We're not leaving you. Kimber!

1399
01:18:17.208 --> 01:18:18.792
You have to. Go.

1400
01:18:18.875 --> 01:18:21.292
He left his phone.

1401
01:18:21.417 --> 01:18:24.250
He has my dad's number.
Send him my location. okay?

1402
01:18:24.375 --> 01:18:26.250
Hurry!

1403
01:18:26.375 --> 01:18:27.500
Hide!

1404
01:18:27.667 --> 01:18:28.917
(door closing)

1405
01:18:32.792 --> 01:18:34.042
(breathing heavily)

1406
01:18:34.167 --> 01:18:36.083
- (grunting)
- Driver: Kimber?

1407
01:18:43.292 --> 01:18:44.333
Did you call for me?

1408
01:18:53.542 --> 01:18:55.292
Do you need anything?

1409
01:18:55.375 --> 01:18:56.583
Water?

1410
01:18:56.708 --> 01:18:58.083
Are you hungry?

1411
01:18:58.208 --> 01:19:00.375
Kimber:
You have what you were after.

1412
01:19:01.708 --> 01:19:03.375
You have to let us go.

1413
01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:07.250
We have to help her.

1414
01:19:07.375 --> 01:19:09.375
I can't. I'm sorry.

1415
01:19:09.542 --> 01:19:10.667
We have to wait.

1416
01:19:10.792 --> 01:19:12.083
Help is coming.

1417
01:19:17.875 --> 01:19:20.000
Are you really Austin's brother?

1418
01:19:21.708 --> 01:19:23.000
He's my brother.

1419
01:19:25.375 --> 01:19:26.375
But I'm not like him.

1420
01:19:27.667 --> 01:19:28.958
Obsessed like him.

1421
01:19:30.792 --> 01:19:33.208
So then why are you doing this?

1422
01:19:33.333 --> 01:19:36.250
Because he's the only family
I have left.

1423
01:19:40.583 --> 01:19:42.000
I'm sorry.

1424
01:19:44.333 --> 01:19:45.750
It's not your fault.

1425
01:19:55.875 --> 01:19:57.375
You're innocent in all this.

1426
01:20:03.375 --> 01:20:06.000
Tonight was supposed
to be your special night.

1427
01:20:06.083 --> 01:20:07.917
But you never even
got the chance

1428
01:20:08.042 --> 01:20:09.542
to have your first dance.

1429
01:20:16.792 --> 01:20:18.792
(breathing heavily)

1430
01:20:19.667 --> 01:20:21.458
(crickets chirping)

1431
01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:35.917
♪

1432
01:20:39.125 --> 01:20:41.042
May I have this dance?

1433
01:21:01.292 --> 01:21:03.750
In case we don't make it
through this. Joan.

1434
01:21:03.875 --> 01:21:06.208
I'm sorry for how I treated you.

1435
01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:09.500
The teasing. the names.

1436
01:21:11.417 --> 01:21:14.667
I understand why Kimber
thinks so highly of you.

1437
01:21:14.792 --> 01:21:16.583
Why you're her friend.

1438
01:21:19.875 --> 01:21:21.250
This is nice.

1439
01:21:23.125 --> 01:21:25.917
Maybe when this is all over.

1440
01:21:26.042 --> 01:21:28.292
we could all hang out together
sometime.

1441
01:21:28.375 --> 01:21:30.333
Don't push it.

1442
01:21:30.458 --> 01:21:31.958
Who's "Everleigh"?

1443
01:21:32.875 --> 01:21:34.625
It's Kimber's location!

1444
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:37.167
Maybe she got away!

1445
01:21:37.292 --> 01:21:40.375
Do not reply.
We don't know who sent that.

1446
01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:42.250
I'm not waiting.

1447
01:21:42.375 --> 01:21:45.000
Listen. additional units
are downstairs.

1448
01:21:45.083 --> 01:21:46.833
I got to get these guys
up to speed.

1449
01:21:46.958 --> 01:21:48.375
Wait here.

1450
01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:50.250
All good. On my way.

1451
01:21:51.792 --> 01:21:53.250
- I'm done waiting. Let's go.
- Yeah.

1452
01:21:53.375 --> 01:21:55.417
They can catch up to us
on the road.

1453
01:22:03.208 --> 01:22:05.333
I can't see them behind us.
You think we should slow down?

1454
01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:08.458
If I wanted your input. Paul.
I'd ask for it.

1455
01:22:08.542 --> 01:22:10.417
Okay.

1456
01:22:10.542 --> 01:22:12.542
Hold on. baby. I'm coming.

1457
01:22:18.542 --> 01:22:21.042
Driver: My brother never
understood what he had with you.

1458
01:22:22.125 --> 01:22:23.917
All he cares about is revenge.

1459
01:22:26.625 --> 01:22:28.167
And what do you care about?

1460
01:22:29.667 --> 01:22:31.458
I care about you. Kimber.

1461
01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.042
Ever since that first night
we met.

1462
01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.333
The party.

1463
01:22:41.042 --> 01:22:42.333
That was you.

1464
01:22:44.708 --> 01:22:46.042
After we failed the first time.

1465
01:22:46.167 --> 01:22:47.417
we started watching you.

1466
01:22:49.208 --> 01:22:50.542
Getting to know you.

1467
01:22:52.125 --> 01:22:54.042
Coming up with a better plan.

1468
01:23:02.708 --> 01:23:04.292
I'm so sorry. Kimber...

1469
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.333
For hurting you.

1470
01:23:26.875 --> 01:23:28.500
My real name is Emerson.

1471
01:23:31.375 --> 01:23:32.500
Emerson.

1472
01:23:34.667 --> 01:23:37.292
There's still time to let us go.

1473
01:23:37.375 --> 01:23:38.625
Austin?

1474
01:23:41.708 --> 01:23:43.375
- You liar!
- Hyah!

1475
01:23:45.042 --> 01:23:46.375
Driver:
You shouldn't have done that.

1476
01:23:46.542 --> 01:23:48.375
(grunting)

1477
01:23:48.542 --> 01:23:50.542
(groaning)

1478
01:23:50.667 --> 01:23:51.750
(gasping)

1479
01:23:51.875 --> 01:23:54.125
Kimber. get in the car!

1480
01:23:56.583 --> 01:23:58.125
(limo doors closing)

1481
01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.333
You guys okay?

1482
01:24:02.417 --> 01:24:03.542
Keys.

1483
01:24:03.708 --> 01:24:05.125
Buckle up.

1484
01:24:08.083 --> 01:24:10.000
(ignition starts)

1485
01:24:12.917 --> 01:24:15.000
Austin:
Emerson. what's taking so long?

1486
01:24:15.125 --> 01:24:16.417
This is about to get bumpy.

1487
01:24:21.583 --> 01:24:22.792
(car alarm chirps)

1488
01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:26.417
No! No!

1489
01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:29.542
No! No! No!

1490
01:24:35.875 --> 01:24:37.375
Everleigh:
Get out of the car!

1491
01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:38.750
Kimber!

1492
01:24:38.875 --> 01:24:40.292
(all panting)

1493
01:24:41.708 --> 01:24:43.167
Austin:
You know.

1494
01:24:43.292 --> 01:24:45.750
my mom didn't get
to teach me a whole lot.

1495
01:24:45.875 --> 01:24:48.292
but she did teach me one thing.

1496
01:24:50.167 --> 01:24:51.458
Always have a spare.

1497
01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:55.583
Austin. you got what you wanted.

1498
01:24:55.708 --> 01:24:59.000
Just drive away.
Nobody will follow you.

1499
01:24:59.125 --> 01:25:01.417
Why can't you just let this go?

1500
01:25:03.875 --> 01:25:05.333
I can't let this go.

1501
01:25:09.625 --> 01:25:11.208
(all scream)

1502
01:25:12.583 --> 01:25:14.083
No!

1503
01:25:15.708 --> 01:25:17.750
- Oh. my God!
- Mom!

1504
01:25:17.875 --> 01:25:19.792
Mom!

1505
01:25:19.917 --> 01:25:21.667
Shawna:
Oh. my God.

1506
01:25:21.792 --> 01:25:22.833
- (sighs)
- Kimber: Dad!

1507
01:25:22.917 --> 01:25:24.292
Hey.

1508
01:25:25.542 --> 01:25:27.333
Kimber:
I knew you guys would find me.

1509
01:25:27.458 --> 01:25:29.625
- Oh. there was never any doubt.
- You girls okay?

1510
01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:31.000
Yeah?

1511
01:25:31.083 --> 01:25:32.500
The police are on their way.

1512
01:25:33.375 --> 01:25:36.208

You poor things.

1514
01:25:46.917 --> 01:25:48.542
You okay. honey?

1515
01:25:48.667 --> 01:25:50.208
I think so.

1516
01:25:51.333 --> 01:25:54.500
Hey. look what I found.

1517
01:25:54.583 --> 01:25:56.500
- (laughs)
- It's a little worse for wear.

1518
01:25:56.625 --> 01:25:58.000
but it still works.
believe it or not.

1519
01:25:58.125 --> 01:26:00.625
My phone. How'd you find it?

1520
01:26:01.583 --> 01:26:03.458
That is a story for another day.
