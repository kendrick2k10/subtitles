24
00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.595

You miss me?

26
00:34:59.806 --> 00:35:01.182
Very. very much.

Hello?

53
00:53:42.052 --> 00:53:42.928
Hello. dearest.

54
00:53:43.011 --> 00:53:44.179
Hello.

55
00:53:44.262 --> 00:53:45.305
Where are you?

56
00:53:45.388 --> 00:53:46.890
I'm in bed.

57
00:53:46.973 --> 00:53:49.392
I've been trying to call you for an hour.

58
00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:51.228
You have?

59
00:53:51.311 --> 00:53:53.772
-Do you love your man?
-Yes.

60
00:53:53.855 --> 00:53:55.565
Your man loves his lady fair.

61
00:53:56.066 --> 00:53:59.778
Quit waking me up.
or I'm gonna knock you out when I see you.

62
00:53:59.861 --> 00:54:01.404
All right. dearest one.

63
00:54:02.405 --> 00:54:05.200
Take care. precious package.

64
00:54:06.284 --> 00:54:10.872
I told you that my dream last night was
that I'd been put on this Earth

65
00:54:11.373 --> 00:54:14.918
to try to make life better for you
than when you were young.

66
00:54:15.001 --> 00:54:16.336
I know. honey.

67
00:54:16.836 --> 00:54:19.422
Tell me tomorrow. I'll forget tonight.

68
00:54:19.506 --> 00:54:21.049
All right. dearest.

69
00:54:21.132 --> 00:54:22.342
Okay. Bye.

70
00:54:22.425 --> 00:54:24.636
-Take care. precious package.
-I will.

71
00:54:24.719 --> 00:54:26.096
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

72
00:57:06.005 --> 00:57:07.924
This is Howard Marshall.

73
00:57:08.007 --> 00:57:13.930
I think my son Pierce
has overreached a little bit.

74
00:57:14.013 --> 00:57:18.643
He has no business
coming between my wife and myself.

75
00:57:19.936 --> 00:57:22.647
I want my wife

76
00:57:24.441 --> 00:57:27.610
to be supported

77
00:57:27.694 --> 00:57:28.862
by me.

78
00:57:28.945 --> 00:57:30.864
She's the light of my life.

79
00:57:32.949 --> 00:57:35.952
I don't think
Pierce quite understands that.

80
00:57:36.536 --> 00:57:38.913
or maybe he's a little bit jealous.

81
00:57:40.373 --> 00:57:43.251
I want my wife taken care of.

82
01:48:55.737 --> 01:48:59.866
First of all. she's not my mother.
She's my birth mother.

83
01:50:59.027 --> 01:51:00.320
We were not poor.

84
01:51:01.071 --> 01:51:04.032
We lived a moderate life in Houston.

85
01:51:08.495 --> 01:51:11.289
Three bedrooms. two carports.
