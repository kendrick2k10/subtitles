3
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.677
Good luck. brother.

4
00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:12.768
Keep your wits
about you. Michael.

5
00:01:12.768 --> 00:01:14.248
Would love a little
competition this year.

6
00:01:14.248 --> 00:01:15.945
<i>This is Bear Grylls
coming to you</i>

7
00:01:15.945 --> 00:01:17.512
<i>from Costa Rica.</i>

8
00:01:17.512 --> 00:01:20.428
<i>and the 2015 Adventure Racing
World Championship.</i>

9
00:01:20.428 --> 00:01:22.082
Be waiting for you
at the finish line. Decker.

10
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.303
All right. Helen's with me.
Let's go!

11
00:01:26.303 --> 00:01:27.913
<i>Michael Light
is arguably</i>

12
00:01:27.913 --> 00:01:31.352
<i>the best adventure racer
to never win a championship.</i>

13
00:01:31.352 --> 00:01:33.571
<i>Michael and his team
are compelling contenders</i>

14
00:01:33.571 --> 00:01:36.226
<i>along with defending champions
Team Arc'Teryx.</i>

15
00:01:36.226 --> 00:01:37.662
Why aren't they paddling?

16
00:01:37.662 --> 00:01:39.011
Because they're weak.

17
00:01:39.011 --> 00:01:40.578
Don't worry about them.
Just keep paddling!

18
00:01:40.578 --> 00:01:43.103
<i>No matter how good
Michael's team is.</i>

19
00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:45.453
<i>he always manages
to come up short.</i>

20
00:01:45.453 --> 00:01:47.846
<i>Some might say
he's his own worst enemy.</i>

21
00:01:47.846 --> 00:01:49.370
Michael. the tide's going out
to the ocean.

22
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.067
We'll be paddling like hell
for nothing.

23
00:01:51.067 --> 00:01:52.938
Even Arc'Teryx
is sitting it out.

24
00:01:52.938 --> 00:01:54.810
We could still win
if we're patient.

25
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.420
Helen. you're nav.
What do you think?

26
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.161
Leo. just shut up and paddle!

27
00:01:58.161 --> 00:02:00.468
Trust your team.
Michael!

28
00:02:00.468 --> 00:02:01.817
Come on.

29
00:02:02.948 --> 00:02:04.167
Come on!

30
00:02:11.522 --> 00:02:12.567
Shit.

31
00:02:12.567 --> 00:02:14.003
It's salty!

32
00:02:14.003 --> 00:02:15.483
Tide's taking us
in the wrong direction!

33
00:02:15.483 --> 00:02:16.745
Just go with it!

34
00:02:16.745 --> 00:02:17.920
We should turn around!

35
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.096
Leo! Just keep paddling harder!

36
00:02:28.757 --> 00:02:30.150
Running out of water. Michael.

37
00:02:37.853 --> 00:02:39.681
Can't paddle
in the mud. Michael!

38
00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:41.204
It's okay. John!

39
00:02:41.204 --> 00:02:42.553
All right. just keep going!

40
00:02:42.553 --> 00:02:44.033
We're gonna pull 'em for now.

41
00:02:44.033 --> 00:02:45.339
and when the tide comes in.
we're back in business!

42
00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:47.341
This isn't the end! Let's go!

43
00:02:49.343 --> 00:02:50.866
Drink this. Michael.

44
00:02:51.606 --> 00:02:53.216
He needs some help.

45
00:02:53.216 --> 00:02:54.304
An IV at the least.

46
00:02:54.304 --> 00:02:55.914
- An IV? Are you crazy?
- Michael!

47
00:02:55.914 --> 00:02:57.829
That's a four-hour penalty.
No way.

48
00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.440
It's not happening.
Stick him in my kayak.

49
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.528
I'll pull him myself.

50
00:03:00.528 --> 00:03:01.920
Are you outta your goddamn mind?

51
00:03:03.052 --> 00:03:04.793
Look around you!
Look at your team!

52
00:03:04.793 --> 00:03:06.229
You gotta be shitting me.

53
00:03:06.925 --> 00:03:08.449
He's so weak.

54
00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:10.364
Don't blame your bad decisions
on your team. Michael.

55
00:03:13.018 --> 00:03:14.846
Yeah. the whole world's
gonna see this.

56
00:05:51.612 --> 00:05:54.005
-Daddy!
- I'm in here.

57
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.227
- Hey.
- Look.

58
00:05:58.227 --> 00:06:00.011
Oh. what do you have there?

59
00:06:00.011 --> 00:06:01.491
It's for you.

60
00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:03.754
It's pink. Can I?

61
00:06:03.754 --> 00:06:05.713
Well. of course you can.

62
00:06:05.713 --> 00:06:06.975
But just do my nails. okay?

63
00:06:06.975 --> 00:06:08.977
Not my mustache
and my eyebrows this time.

64
00:06:12.197 --> 00:06:13.634
Hello.
Hey.

65
00:06:16.506 --> 00:06:17.855
Did you have anything
to do with this?

66
00:06:17.855 --> 00:06:19.857
Wow.
That's a beautiful color.

67
00:06:19.857 --> 00:06:21.946
Yeah? You should see my toes.

68
00:06:21.946 --> 00:06:23.818
I'm gonna get her
some coloring books.

69
00:06:23.818 --> 00:06:25.254
When did she fall in love
with nail polish?

70
00:06:25.254 --> 00:06:27.038
I have no idea.

71
00:06:27.038 --> 00:06:28.257
Definitely doesn't
get it from me.

72
00:06:28.866 --> 00:06:29.867
Huh.

73
00:06:31.216 --> 00:06:33.001
Your bloody socks
and muddy shoes

74
00:06:33.001 --> 00:06:35.003
- are still by the door.
- Just went for a run.

75
00:06:35.003 --> 00:06:36.396
You've seen worse. right?

76
00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:39.616
Only when I was in training.

77
00:06:39.616 --> 00:06:41.183
So you're allowed
to stay in perfect. beautiful.

78
00:06:41.183 --> 00:06:43.533
amazing shape. and I'm just
supposed to get soft?

79
00:06:43.533 --> 00:06:45.317
Your flattery won't work.

80
00:06:45.317 --> 00:06:46.667
Then what will?

81
00:06:48.016 --> 00:06:49.757
You going to work.

82
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.976
All right.

83
00:06:51.976 --> 00:06:53.064
- I'll see you later.
- Michael.

84
00:06:53.064 --> 00:06:54.326
- What?
- Where's the shirt?

85
00:06:54.326 --> 00:06:56.328
The shirt? Which shirt?

86
00:06:56.328 --> 00:06:58.113
The shirt
your dad asked you to wear.

87
00:06:59.984 --> 00:07:01.638
I can't.

88
00:07:01.638 --> 00:07:04.249
Come on.
Wear the shirt.

89
00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:05.990
Mwah! I don't
even think he'll notice.

90
00:07:07.122 --> 00:07:08.993
- Bye!
- Bye.

91
00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:29.623
Okay.
reinforcements have arrived.

92
00:07:29.623 --> 00:07:31.755
- Hey.
-How's it going. son?

93
00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:36.891
Wow. That's a busy day.

94
00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:38.545
Oh. it was crazy. nonstop.

95
00:07:38.545 --> 00:07:39.937
Think you might get
a couple bites.

96
00:07:39.937 --> 00:07:40.982
Mm.

97
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.724
Where's your shirt?

98
00:07:43.724 --> 00:07:45.769
- Really?
- Yeah. Your shirt.

99
00:07:45.769 --> 00:07:46.857
Do you know
what it's like wearing

100
00:07:46.857 --> 00:07:48.250
a shirt with your name on it?

101
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.557
Yeah. Yeah. I do.

102
00:07:50.557 --> 00:07:51.732
Gotta wear the shirt.

103
00:07:54.256 --> 00:07:56.258
Hmm. You know.
well. this is interesting.

104
00:07:56.258 --> 00:07:58.086
- What?

105
00:07:58.086 --> 00:08:00.784
All these signatures
have the same handwriting

106
00:08:00.784 --> 00:08:03.178
- and they're all left-handed.

107
00:08:03.178 --> 00:08:05.354
Yeah. well. people don't want
to sign in. all right?

108
00:08:05.354 --> 00:08:07.095
You're spamming them
with marketing crap.

109
00:08:07.095 --> 00:08:08.575
It's invasive.
I'm not a salesman.

110
00:08:08.575 --> 00:08:10.098
- Okay. okay.
- I show 'em the house.

111
00:08:10.098 --> 00:08:11.273
I don't wanna jam it
down their throat.

112
00:08:11.273 --> 00:08:12.535
If they like it.
they'll make an offer.

113
00:08:13.623 --> 00:08:14.711
Can I have
my cards back. please?

114
00:08:14.711 --> 00:08:16.626
Oh. my God.

115
00:08:16.626 --> 00:08:18.106
- Here you go. Detective.
- Just look at that.

116
00:08:18.106 --> 00:08:19.194
- Look at that.
- Cracked the case.

117
00:08:19.194 --> 00:08:21.544
- Wow.
- Jesus Christ.

118
00:08:21.544 --> 00:08:24.068
"I'll sell you a house
you can build a home in."

119
00:08:24.765 --> 00:08:26.897
Oh. your mother.

120
00:08:26.897 --> 00:08:28.159
Your mom came up with that.

121
00:08:28.159 --> 00:08:30.597
- I remember.
- Yeah. me too.

122
00:08:30.597 --> 00:08:33.164
People wanna
put down roots. Mikey.

123
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:34.992
And?

124
00:08:34.992 --> 00:08:37.778
You. on the other hand.
spend all your time

125
00:08:37.778 --> 00:08:39.997
- trying to pull 'em up.
- That's not true. all right?

126
00:08:39.997 --> 00:08:41.346
I have a wonderful family.

127
00:08:41.346 --> 00:08:42.565
I have a home. I have
a lot of stuff going on.

128
00:08:42.565 --> 00:08:43.653
There's more riding
on a marriage

129
00:08:43.653 --> 00:08:45.176
than just a house. you know.

130
00:08:45.176 --> 00:08:46.308
My marriage is fine.

131
00:08:46.308 --> 00:08:47.614
Did Helen say something to you?

132
00:08:47.614 --> 00:08:49.006
No. I know. All right?
Time out. Time out.

133
00:08:50.225 --> 00:08:51.661
I know what you're doing.

134
00:08:51.661 --> 00:08:53.881
because I did the same thing
myself in the service.

135
00:08:53.881 --> 00:08:55.447
You know.
you're either chasing a rush.

136
00:08:55.447 --> 00:08:56.753
or you're longing for something.

137
00:08:56.753 --> 00:08:58.189
you're denying yourself.
It doesn't matter.

138
00:08:58.189 --> 00:09:01.323
But either way. it's not fair
to Helen and Ruby.

139
00:09:01.323 --> 00:09:02.803
You know. that's real easy
for you to say.

140
00:09:02.803 --> 00:09:04.239
- Why is that?
- Well. you got out

141
00:09:04.239 --> 00:09:05.893
of the military with
a chestful of medals. right?

142
00:09:05.893 --> 00:09:07.416
I washed up mid-race on shore.

143
00:09:07.416 --> 00:09:09.636
I didn't even make it
to the finish line.

144
00:09:09.636 --> 00:09:10.985
Well. the grass in your yard

145
00:09:10.985 --> 00:09:12.116
is only as green as you grow it.

146
00:09:12.116 --> 00:09:13.596
You should put that
on your sign.

147
00:09:13.596 --> 00:09:15.598
That's a good idea.
I'll get right on that.

148
00:09:15.598 --> 00:09:17.034
You like the name
on your shirt. right?

149
00:09:17.034 --> 00:09:18.340
You like the medals
on your chest?

150
00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.168
What's wrong with me
wanting the same thing?

151
00:09:20.168 --> 00:09:21.648
Where do you think
I got it from?

152
00:09:23.954 --> 00:09:25.521
Just don't be selfish. Mikey.

153
00:10:29.585 --> 00:10:31.413
She's asleep.

154
00:10:31.413 --> 00:10:32.762
Well. that's good.

155
00:10:32.762 --> 00:10:34.372
Steaks will be done
in a couple of minutes.

156
00:10:34.372 --> 00:10:35.939
Couple of minutes
till it's burned?

157
00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:37.767
It's called a sear.

158
00:10:37.767 --> 00:10:39.073
Oh. right.

159
00:10:43.164 --> 00:10:44.382
You're missing the view.

160
00:10:45.906 --> 00:10:46.907
I'm sorry.

161
00:10:50.301 --> 00:10:51.302
Look at this.

162
00:10:53.522 --> 00:10:56.133
Michael. that photo
is three years old.

163
00:10:56.133 --> 00:10:58.092
Yeah. well. my dad makes
it seem like it was yesterday.

164
00:10:59.876 --> 00:11:01.138
- So?
- What do you mean "so?"

165
00:11:01.138 --> 00:11:03.706
It has 182.000 likes
of me stuck in the mud.

166
00:11:03.706 --> 00:11:05.447
Yeah. and?

167
00:11:05.447 --> 00:11:07.318
And I raced for 19 years.

168
00:11:07.318 --> 00:11:08.972
That's what I'm remembered for.

169
00:11:08.972 --> 00:11:10.887
- Where are you?
- I'm right here.

170
00:11:10.887 --> 00:11:12.323
No. you're not.

171
00:11:13.237 --> 00:11:14.935
You're in a jungle somewhere.

172
00:11:14.935 --> 00:11:18.242
beating yourself to death
with some magical finish line.

173
00:11:18.242 --> 00:11:21.028
Well. that's what I do. okay?
Racers race.

174
00:11:21.028 --> 00:11:23.073
I was a racer.
and now I'm a mom.

175
00:11:23.073 --> 00:11:24.858
And. so. just like that
I'm done?

176
00:11:24.858 --> 00:11:26.773
No. this is not
how it ends for me.

177
00:11:29.036 --> 00:11:31.342
Oh. shit.
I burned the steak.

178
00:11:31.342 --> 00:11:33.997
No. a perfect sear like always.

179
00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.870
Yeah.

180
00:11:41.526 --> 00:11:43.703
You know.
this doesn't define you.

181
00:11:47.097 --> 00:11:49.447
Make some calls. Michael.

182
00:11:49.447 --> 00:11:50.579
Just see who's out there.

183
00:11:51.754 --> 00:11:54.191
Make some visits
and go get a sponsor.

184
00:11:56.106 --> 00:11:58.369
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

185
00:11:59.327 --> 00:12:01.155
Racers race. right?

186
00:12:10.991 --> 00:12:12.340
Are these
friends of yours?

187
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:13.645
What's all this?

188
00:12:13.645 --> 00:12:16.474
Silicon Valley
glamping expedition.

189
00:12:16.474 --> 00:12:18.694
They pretend like they're
roughing it for a night.

190
00:12:18.694 --> 00:12:22.524
and I make sure the s'mores
and pinot noir are ready.

191
00:12:22.524 --> 00:12:23.655
What. and people pay for this?

192
00:12:23.655 --> 00:12:24.831
Yeah.

193
00:12:24.831 --> 00:12:27.268
I'm kind of a tour guide.

194
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:30.924
Don't look at me like that.
It's good money. man.

195
00:12:30.924 --> 00:12:32.490
It's about time for me and Molly

196
00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:35.058
to move out of the beach shack
and build a real house.

197
00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:38.714
Putting together a new team
for the world championships

198
00:12:38.714 --> 00:12:40.063
in the Dominican Republic.

199
00:12:41.064 --> 00:12:42.587
Spare no expense.

200
00:12:43.893 --> 00:12:46.069
- Michael. I...
- Chik. one more win

201
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:47.854
and you're the oldest
world champion ever.

202
00:12:47.854 --> 00:12:49.246
Endorsement deals alone

203
00:12:49.246 --> 00:12:50.508
are gonna get you and Molly
out of this shack.

204
00:12:50.508 --> 00:12:52.641
and you can build
whatever house you want.

205
00:12:52.641 --> 00:12:54.077
Not to mention
you get to put a medal

206
00:12:54.077 --> 00:12:55.992
around your neck
in front of Decker Swanson.

207
00:12:55.992 --> 00:12:58.168
He dropped you
the minute you showed a limp.

208
00:13:00.214 --> 00:13:01.345
You have sponsors?

209
00:13:03.173 --> 00:13:04.435
I will.

210
00:13:07.743 --> 00:13:09.049
How's the knee holdin' up?

211
00:13:10.615 --> 00:13:12.748
Don't worry about the knee.
I'll be fine.

212
00:13:12.748 --> 00:13:14.794
I'm not worried about the knee.

213
00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:16.143
I'm worried about my future.

214
00:13:16.143 --> 00:13:17.709
Excuse me. sir?

215
00:13:17.709 --> 00:13:18.928
It's getting windy.

216
00:13:18.928 --> 00:13:21.017
and the sand
is getting in everything.

217
00:13:21.017 --> 00:13:23.367
Is there something
we can do about that?

218
00:13:23.367 --> 00:13:25.369
Hey. man.
Are the s'mores ready yet?

219
00:13:25.369 --> 00:13:26.893
I'm friggin' starving.

220
00:13:26.893 --> 00:13:28.111
Yeah. I'm coming.

221
00:13:29.286 --> 00:13:30.679
Time to make the s'mores. Chiki.

222
00:13:32.333 --> 00:13:34.291
I'd help you. but...

223
00:13:34.291 --> 00:13:36.424
I can't do
anything about the wind.

224
00:13:36.424 --> 00:13:39.470
- Good luck with that one.

225
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:40.732
I'll see you soon.

226
00:13:43.735 --> 00:13:45.737
<i>Michael.
when we look at your results.</i>

227
00:13:45.737 --> 00:13:48.958
<i>we see a lot of top tens.
but not a lot of victories.</i>

228
00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.830
<i>Zero. actually.</i>

229
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.875
We're used
to our clients winning.

230
00:13:52.875 --> 00:13:55.095
My sponsors always
were well represented.

231
00:13:55.095 --> 00:13:56.748
Then why'd they all leave you?

232
00:13:58.620 --> 00:13:59.839
Well. you'd have to ask them.

233
00:14:01.492 --> 00:14:02.667
I'm asking you.

234
00:14:04.974 --> 00:14:08.673
Well.  had a baby.
Took some time off.

235
00:14:08.673 --> 00:14:10.240
Look. this is
a very unique opportunity

236
00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.894
for you at Broadrail.

237
00:14:11.894 --> 00:14:14.244
I have a new team lined up.
which I'm very excited about.

238
00:14:14.244 --> 00:14:16.246
First one there is Chik.
William Chikerotis.

239
00:14:16.246 --> 00:14:17.421
He's a four-time world champion

240
00:14:17.421 --> 00:14:18.858
that'll serve as my navigator.

241
00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:21.077
He was with Team Arc'Teryx
for years.

242
00:14:21.077 --> 00:14:24.646
Oh. we know. He's a legend.
And he's even older than you.

243
00:14:24.646 --> 00:14:27.388
Oh. he can still race.
trust me.

244
00:14:27.388 --> 00:14:29.346
He's even leaving his team
to race with me.

245
00:14:30.173 --> 00:14:31.566
Michael. I mean.

246
00:14:31.566 --> 00:14:33.394
we all know he was dropped
by his team. right?

247
00:14:33.394 --> 00:14:34.438
Bad knee?

248
00:14:39.182 --> 00:14:40.183
Who else?

249
00:14:41.837 --> 00:14:43.360
Olivia Baker.

250
00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.884
Daughter of the Hugo Baker.

251
00:14:46.059 --> 00:14:47.625
Trains in Hawaii year-round.

252
00:14:47.625 --> 00:14:49.062
One of the best climbers
I've ever seen.

253
00:15:06.731 --> 00:15:08.211
Heel hook!

254
00:15:08.211 --> 00:15:10.039
<i>I can't hear you.</i>

255
00:15:10.039 --> 00:15:11.301
The hell you can't!

256
00:15:11.301 --> 00:15:13.173
You're gonna have
to bitch louder.

257
00:15:15.131 --> 00:15:16.872
You're the only one
that listens to me. Spike.

258
00:15:17.481 --> 00:15:18.961
Excuse me.

259
00:15:18.961 --> 00:15:21.442
- Are you Hugo Baker?
- Maybe.

260
00:15:21.442 --> 00:15:22.617
Well. I had a poster
of you climbing

261
00:15:22.617 --> 00:15:25.011
the Half Dome
in my room growing up.

262
00:15:25.011 --> 00:15:26.534
Actually inspired me
to climb it myself

263
00:15:26.534 --> 00:15:28.405
a couple years ago.

264
00:15:28.405 --> 00:15:30.886
- Michael Light.
- I know who you are.

265
00:15:39.199 --> 00:15:40.765
She's pretty good. huh?

266
00:15:40.765 --> 00:15:42.898
She would be if she gave
a whale's hump.

267
00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.988
You got a spare harness?

268
00:15:45.988 --> 00:15:47.555
I'd like to go say hello.

269
00:15:48.817 --> 00:15:50.775
<i>You've got a visitor.</i>

270
00:15:50.775 --> 00:15:51.820
What?

271
00:15:54.562 --> 00:15:57.434
Hey. Nice office.

272
00:15:57.434 --> 00:15:59.654
Michael Light. Let me guess.

273
00:15:59.654 --> 00:16:01.569
The Dominican.
and you need a woman.

274
00:16:02.657 --> 00:16:03.788
I need you.

275
00:16:04.528 --> 00:16:05.921
What about Helen?

276
00:16:05.921 --> 00:16:07.836
Fully retired.
She's a full-time mom now.

277
00:16:07.836 --> 00:16:09.881
Well. sorry.
I've given up racing.

278
00:16:09.881 --> 00:16:12.797
- I've given up climbing.
- Really?

279
00:16:12.797 --> 00:16:15.235
Wow. I mean.
you could've fooled me.

280
00:16:15.235 --> 00:16:18.325
Well. I do it for him.
It makes him happy.

281
00:16:18.325 --> 00:16:21.197
Go make him happy.
Win a world championship.

282
00:16:21.197 --> 00:16:22.764
<i>Hey. Michael.</i>

283
00:16:22.764 --> 00:16:25.332
- You gonna finish this year?

284
00:16:25.332 --> 00:16:26.942
Yeah. I'm gonna finish.

285
00:16:26.942 --> 00:16:28.378
And with your daughter.
I'm gonna win.

286
00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.296
What do you think.
old boy?

287
00:16:35.081 --> 00:16:36.169
I agree.

288
00:16:36.169 --> 00:16:38.562
Olivia. you need to go.

289
00:16:38.562 --> 00:16:40.869
<i>Will you make
an old man happy and go race?</i>

290
00:16:40.869 --> 00:16:41.957
<i>Would ya?</i>

291
00:16:41.957 --> 00:16:43.741
I need this.

292
00:16:43.741 --> 00:16:46.135
And maybe you do. too.

293
00:16:46.135 --> 00:16:48.355
Well. if the man says "race."
then let's race.

294
00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:50.313
I gotta run.

295
00:16:51.619 --> 00:16:53.012
See you down there!

296
00:16:57.016 --> 00:16:58.365
And my fourth here
is a young guy I found...

297
00:16:58.365 --> 00:17:00.715
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
What about Leo Sun?

298
00:17:00.715 --> 00:17:02.760
He was a part of your team
the last go-around.

299
00:17:03.544 --> 00:17:04.675
Why not use him?

300
00:17:05.894 --> 00:17:07.896
Well. Leo races
for all the wrong reasons.

301
00:17:07.896 --> 00:17:09.680
Self-promotion. glory.

302
00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.465
Well. what would be
the right ones?

303
00:17:11.465 --> 00:17:13.815
Like. why do you race. Michael?

304
00:17:13.815 --> 00:17:16.122
Leo has over 1.000.000
followers on Instagram

305
00:17:16.122 --> 00:17:17.558
and almost as many on Twitter.

306
00:17:17.558 --> 00:17:19.255
Leo's not a good idea.

307
00:17:19.255 --> 00:17:20.909
I... I have to agree with John.

308
00:17:20.909 --> 00:17:22.780
All right. Well. what is this

309
00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:24.217
unique opportunity
gonna cost us?

310
00:17:25.261 --> 00:17:26.480
Well. to do it right.

311
00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.916
I need to get
to the Dominican Republic

312
00:17:27.916 --> 00:17:29.526
at least four weeks early
to train and acclimate

313
00:17:29.526 --> 00:17:31.137
to the heat
and the humidity. so...

314
00:17:31.137 --> 00:17:32.660
You need four weeks for that?

315
00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:34.705
No. I need six to eight.
but I'll make it work.

316
00:17:34.705 --> 00:17:37.143
-How much?
- $100.000.

317
00:17:39.232 --> 00:17:41.190
How much sponsor money
did you get in the last race

318
00:17:42.191 --> 00:17:44.498
when you only lasted one day?

319
00:17:46.152 --> 00:17:47.109
Hey. um...

320
00:17:48.545 --> 00:17:49.546
I'll meet you outside. Michael.

321
00:17:59.469 --> 00:18:02.994
You know.
my senior year in high school.

322
00:18:02.994 --> 00:18:04.866
I was cut
from the football team.

323
00:18:04.866 --> 00:18:07.129
Three months later. I was cut
from the basketball team.

324
00:18:07.129 --> 00:18:08.609
And then at baseball tryouts.

325
00:18:08.609 --> 00:18:10.306
the coach told me that
I was just wasting his time.

326
00:18:10.306 --> 00:18:11.655
So I left the field.

327
00:18:11.655 --> 00:18:13.179
but instead of going home.
I started running.

328
00:18:13.179 --> 00:18:15.833
All right? I ran 15 miles
in my baseball cleats

329
00:18:15.833 --> 00:18:17.966
and I wore them down
to the soles.

330
00:18:17.966 --> 00:18:19.359
Four hours later.
my feet were bleeding.

331
00:18:19.359 --> 00:18:20.708
and I had a stress fracture
in my shin.

332
00:18:20.708 --> 00:18:22.710
and I had to call my mom
to come and pick me up

333
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:24.233
because I was lost.

334
00:18:24.233 --> 00:18:26.496
And the next day.
I did it again.

335
00:18:26.496 --> 00:18:27.889
And again the day after that.

336
00:18:27.889 --> 00:18:29.108
And you know what I learned?

337
00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:30.848
I learned that
I could embrace pain.

338
00:18:30.848 --> 00:18:32.285
Buckets of it.

339
00:18:32.285 --> 00:18:33.634
All right? I learned
that suffering is a skill

340
00:18:33.634 --> 00:18:35.026
and that I can suffer
more than anyone

341
00:18:35.026 --> 00:18:36.463
- or anything else.
- Michael.

342
00:18:36.463 --> 00:18:38.247
No. no. He wants
to know why I race.

343
00:18:40.554 --> 00:18:41.859
You wanna know why I race?

344
00:18:41.859 --> 00:18:42.991
Because I wanna show people

345
00:18:42.991 --> 00:18:45.036
that I have
what it takes to win.

346
00:18:45.036 --> 00:18:46.821
All right?
So you keep your money.

347
00:18:46.821 --> 00:18:48.170
I'll find another way.

348
00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:50.041
And then you'll know
just why I race.

349
00:18:50.041 --> 00:18:51.434
And you'll be hanging
my picture right there

350
00:18:51.434 --> 00:18:53.871
on the center of that wall.
I promise you that.

351
00:18:53.871 --> 00:18:54.916
Thank you for your time.

352
00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:00.922
He's crazy.

353
00:19:02.967 --> 00:19:04.752
There's only a handful of people

354
00:19:04.752 --> 00:19:06.319
who know what five days racing

355
00:19:06.319 --> 00:19:08.234
the roughest terrain
on earth is like.

356
00:19:08.234 --> 00:19:10.627
And nobody knows that
more than Michael.

357
00:19:10.627 --> 00:19:13.064
Out there.
it is about surviving.

358
00:19:15.589 --> 00:19:16.894
Tucker. he's a survivor.

359
00:19:22.422 --> 00:19:24.032
Jesus. Michael.

360
00:19:24.032 --> 00:19:25.164
I'm sorry.

361
00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:27.905
$50.000.

362
00:19:30.038 --> 00:19:31.082
Can't race on that.

363
00:19:31.082 --> 00:19:32.649
And Leo has to be your fourth.

364
00:19:32.649 --> 00:19:33.998
- What?
- They're counting on

365
00:19:33.998 --> 00:19:35.696
the social media side
to justify the funds.

366
00:19:35.696 --> 00:19:38.046
Oh. my God. Leo and I haven't
even spoken since Costa Rica.

367
00:19:38.046 --> 00:19:39.700
Brother. that's the offer.

368
00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.571
So. I'm supposed to be racing
for social media views now?

369
00:19:41.571 --> 00:19:44.444
If you wanna race. yeah.

370
00:19:46.141 --> 00:19:47.795
Oh. my God.

371
00:19:51.625 --> 00:19:52.887
All right. Nice one.

372
00:19:52.887 --> 00:19:55.324
Sorry. this is a closed set.

373
00:19:55.324 --> 00:19:57.283
- Closed for what?
- It's a private photo shoot.

374
00:19:57.283 --> 00:19:59.372
I'm looking for Leo Sun.

375
00:19:59.372 --> 00:20:00.808
-Chin down.

376
00:20:00.808 --> 00:20:01.896
Never mind. I see him.

377
00:20:02.418 --> 00:20:03.463
Thanks.

378
00:20:05.291 --> 00:20:06.814
Hey. Michael!

379
00:20:06.814 --> 00:20:08.468
- What's going on. man?
-Hey.

380
00:20:08.468 --> 00:20:10.165
Wanna jump
in a couple of shots with me?

381
00:20:10.165 --> 00:20:12.472
No. No. I'm good.

382
00:20:12.472 --> 00:20:14.038
Okay.
we're taking five. everybody.

383
00:20:14.038 --> 00:20:17.041
Still mad about those
mud posts from Costa Rica?

384
00:20:17.041 --> 00:20:18.826
That you posted
all over Instagram? No.

385
00:20:19.348 --> 00:20:20.306
I'm not on it.

386
00:20:21.959 --> 00:20:22.960
Are you sure?

387
00:20:23.961 --> 00:20:25.441
Yeah. Right. right.

388
00:20:25.441 --> 00:20:28.183
So. what's all this?

389
00:20:28.183 --> 00:20:30.229
Oh. it's my new line
of outdoor streetwear.

390
00:20:30.229 --> 00:20:32.753
It's called Restart. One word.

391
00:20:32.753 --> 00:20:34.929
I think "Restart"
is already one word. no?

392
00:20:34.929 --> 00:20:36.235
Well. in six months. Michael.

393
00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:37.366
there won't be
any doubt of that. trust me.

394
00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.673
It's all about brand now.

395
00:20:39.673 --> 00:20:41.631
They'll follow wherever
the money goes. you know?

396
00:20:41.631 --> 00:20:43.590
I thought it was about racing.

397
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:45.983
Well. there's a time
in life to move on.

398
00:20:45.983 --> 00:20:47.724
I wouldn't know. Racers race.

399
00:20:47.724 --> 00:20:50.074
Hmm. Winners win too. right?

400
00:20:52.555 --> 00:20:54.688
Yeah. Would've been good
for your brand.

401
00:20:54.688 --> 00:20:56.777
Would've been great
for the brand. but. uh.

402
00:20:56.777 --> 00:20:58.213
I think I'm doing okay now.

403
00:20:59.475 --> 00:21:00.824
So race with me this year.

404
00:21:00.824 --> 00:21:02.522
I got everything set up.

405
00:21:02.522 --> 00:21:05.351
Sponsors. Chikerotis.
and Olivia Baker.

406
00:21:05.351 --> 00:21:06.613
All we need is you.

407
00:21:06.613 --> 00:21:08.963
Baker?
That Hugo Baker's daughter?

408
00:21:08.963 --> 00:21:10.878
- Yeah.
- Guy was a beast.

409
00:21:10.878 --> 00:21:12.923
Well. she's in.
and she's as good as him.

410
00:21:14.055 --> 00:21:15.796
How's Chiki's knee?

411
00:21:15.796 --> 00:21:17.667
- It's good. He's ready.
- Mm.

412
00:21:18.625 --> 00:21:20.191
You got it all figured out. huh?

413
00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.239
- We're ready. Leo.
- Thank you.

414
00:21:24.239 --> 00:21:26.633
Your sponsors said you had
to bring me on. didn't they?

415
00:21:27.938 --> 00:21:30.158
- They want my followers.
- Yeah.

416
00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:32.552
That's exactly it.

417
00:21:34.554 --> 00:21:35.859
But what happens to all this

418
00:21:35.859 --> 00:21:37.121
when the fact that
you've never won anything

419
00:21:37.121 --> 00:21:39.428
catches up with you?

420
00:21:39.428 --> 00:21:41.038
I mean. is anybody
gonna click on someone

421
00:21:41.038 --> 00:21:42.649
who's no longer relevant?

422
00:21:46.566 --> 00:21:47.784
Tell me you blew it last time.

423
00:21:50.657 --> 00:21:52.354
Tell me your ego.
and your selfishness.

424
00:21:52.354 --> 00:21:54.313
and you not listening to me
cost us that race.

425
00:21:59.361 --> 00:22:01.102
Yeah. Leo. I blew it.

426
00:22:02.538 --> 00:22:03.496
And this year?

427
00:22:04.845 --> 00:22:06.107
It's my team. Leo.

428
00:22:07.804 --> 00:22:09.240
But I'm gonna give you a voice.

429
00:22:11.591 --> 00:22:12.722
It's gonna be a loud one.

430
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.769
It always is.

431
00:22:15.769 --> 00:22:17.510
Just don't show up
wearing makeup. okay?

432
00:22:33.526 --> 00:22:34.918
How's the knee. Chiki?

433
00:22:34.918 --> 00:22:36.659
Wishing it had been here
a couple of weeks earlier.

434
00:22:36.659 --> 00:22:37.878
as you promised.

435
00:22:37.878 --> 00:22:39.270
Hey. We're gonna
get in three climbs

436
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:40.794
over 6.000 feet
before the race. all right?

437
00:22:40.794 --> 00:22:42.665
Three climbs. and we're
supposed to be ready?

438
00:22:42.665 --> 00:22:44.798
Hey. get used to it. Chiki.
We're racing on a budget now.

439
00:22:44.798 --> 00:22:45.929
My bag.

440
00:22:47.148 --> 00:22:49.106
- Hey. everything okay?
- Yeah. fine.

441
00:22:49.106 --> 00:22:50.281
You sure?
You got all your stuff?

442
00:22:50.281 --> 00:22:52.327
- Yeah. we're good.
-Hey!

443
00:22:52.327 --> 00:22:53.850
-Hey. it's okay.

444
00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:56.070
He said. "Damn dogs."

445
00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:57.550
There's thousands of dogs
in the streets.

446
00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:59.508
- and they're sick with rabies.
-Oh. lovely.

447
00:23:01.684 --> 00:23:04.339
What the hell happened
to our training time?

448
00:23:04.339 --> 00:23:06.689
Decker has been here for weeks.

449
00:23:06.689 --> 00:23:08.387
Is this what I have to expect
with you in charge?

450
00:23:08.387 --> 00:23:09.518
We're here now. all right?

451
00:23:09.518 --> 00:23:10.867
Let's just make the best of it.

452
00:23:10.867 --> 00:23:12.695
We're gonna be okay.

453
00:23:12.695 --> 00:23:15.394
I need to check in.
Team Broadrail. Michael Light.

454
00:23:15.394 --> 00:23:16.699
<i>Bienvenidos.</i>

455
00:23:16.699 --> 00:23:18.571
<i>Hola.</i>

456
00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:31.758
Guys.
we gotta move. Shit.

457
00:23:32.976 --> 00:23:34.891
Michael. this is
the easiest trail.

458
00:23:34.891 --> 00:23:37.154
It's all good. all right?
They'll be ready on the day.

459
00:23:37.154 --> 00:23:38.634
Just take a break for a second.

460
00:23:38.634 --> 00:23:40.157
It's just like running
in a damn sauna.

461
00:23:40.157 --> 00:23:41.724
Humidity's gotta be. like. 99%.

462
00:23:41.724 --> 00:23:42.812
Chiki. how's the knee?

463
00:23:42.812 --> 00:23:44.335
- Okay.
-You sure?

464
00:23:44.335 --> 00:23:46.120
- Yes.
- All right.

465
00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.774
- Just take it easy.
-Hey. Michael!

466
00:23:47.774 --> 00:23:49.384
- Oh.
-Oh. no.

467
00:23:49.384 --> 00:23:50.733
Who's that guy?
Hey!

468
00:23:50.733 --> 00:23:51.865
That's Team Arc'Teryx.

469
00:23:51.865 --> 00:23:52.996
Are those kids?

470
00:23:52.996 --> 00:23:54.345
Hey. Deck.
what took you so long?

471
00:23:54.345 --> 00:23:55.695
Kids. say hello
to Uncle Chikerotis.

472
00:23:55.695 --> 00:23:56.870
- You remember him.
-Hi. Uncle Chik.

473
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:58.132
You know.
we've been waiting for ya.

474
00:23:58.132 --> 00:23:59.263
Michael. I thought
you were retired. mate.

475
00:23:59.263 --> 00:24:00.874
Kids wanted
to hike with us today.

476
00:24:00.874 --> 00:24:03.006
-What's up. dick?
- Beautiful up here. innit?

477
00:24:03.006 --> 00:24:04.355
I don't know about you.
but I just love

478
00:24:04.355 --> 00:24:05.618
that thick jungle air.

479
00:24:05.618 --> 00:24:07.010
See you. Uncle Chiki!

480
00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:08.316
Hey. dick!

481
00:24:08.316 --> 00:24:09.578
Your wife follows me
on Instagram. buddy.

482
00:24:23.897 --> 00:24:25.420
Hey.

483
00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:27.204
I'm really glad
your dad made you come.

484
00:24:28.292 --> 00:24:30.556
Yeah. he's a hard man
to say no to.

<i>Where teams are forced
to change disciplines.</i>

526
00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:08.834
<i>navigation becomes crucial.</i>

527
00:29:20.759 --> 00:29:22.282
<i>In roughly
five days' time.</i>

528
00:29:22.282 --> 00:29:25.676
<i>we will crown
the 2018 world champions.</i>

529
00:29:31.073 --> 00:29:33.510
Hey. Get it in. Get it in.

530
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:35.599
All right. come here. Guys...

531
00:29:37.123 --> 00:29:38.646
Chiki's got a great plan.
all right?

532
00:29:38.646 --> 00:29:40.561
We got some good climbs in.
We're ready.

533
00:29:40.561 --> 00:29:43.825
Yeah. and he only threw up
once on the last one. huh?

534
00:29:43.825 --> 00:29:45.827
That you know about.
-Good luck. Chiki.

535
00:29:45.827 --> 00:29:47.481
There's a steep section
in the second half.

536
00:29:47.481 --> 00:29:50.310
so I think we can find
some shortcuts through it

537
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:52.268
if we're willing
to take some risks.

538
00:29:52.268 --> 00:29:54.357
So. a sleepless first half
followed by a sleepless sprint

539
00:29:54.357 --> 00:29:56.490
through a steep
and deadly second half.

540
00:29:56.490 --> 00:29:57.708
Would you want it any other way?

541
00:29:57.708 --> 00:29:59.580
-Hell no.

542
00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:01.974
All right. listen. We all know

543
00:30:01.974 --> 00:30:03.758
the first rule
of adventure racing is

544
00:30:03.758 --> 00:30:05.368
anything can happen out there.

545
00:30:05.368 --> 00:30:07.066
No matter what we encounter.
we accept it.

546
00:30:07.066 --> 00:30:08.937
and we embrace it.
and we keep going.

547
00:30:08.937 --> 00:30:10.417
We push. and we suffer.

548
00:30:10.417 --> 00:30:11.984
and we win.

549
00:30:11.984 --> 00:30:13.942
That's gonna be
the difference. all right?

550
00:30:13.942 --> 00:30:15.204
Who's gonna want it more.

551
00:30:15.204 --> 00:30:16.423
We didn't come here
for second place.

552
00:30:16.423 --> 00:30:17.728
We came here for first.

553
00:30:18.555 --> 00:30:20.296
My dad is dying of cancer.

554
00:30:29.001 --> 00:30:31.699
Olivia. when?
Why didn't you say anything?

555
00:30:31.699 --> 00:30:34.789
I didn't wanna race.
but he insisted. all right?

556
00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:36.051
I'm here because of him.

557
00:30:36.051 --> 00:30:38.749
and every day here
is a day not with him.

558
00:30:38.749 --> 00:30:41.796
So it has to be worth it.
For him.

559
00:30:43.929 --> 00:30:45.626
All right. For him.

560
00:30:45.626 --> 00:30:47.933
For us.
For everyone important to us.

561
00:30:47.933 --> 00:30:50.936
- Yes. Yes. Michael.
- I love you guys.

562
00:30:50.936 --> 00:30:53.852
We make our legacies
in the next five days.

563
00:30:53.852 --> 00:30:56.158
It's my last chance.
This is your last chance.

564
00:30:56.158 --> 00:30:58.204
Let's do this. Let's do this
for your dad. okay?

565
00:30:58.204 --> 00:30:59.292
Yeah.
Yes.

566
00:31:02.686 --> 00:31:07.082
USA! USA! USA!

567
00:31:07.082 --> 00:31:09.650
- Aussie. Aussie. Aussie!
-Oi. oi. oi!

568
00:31:11.434 --> 00:31:13.306
<i>Three! Two!</i>

569
00:31:14.655 --> 00:31:15.961
<i>One!</i>

570
00:31:15.961 --> 00:31:17.745
- Go!

571
00:31:34.327 --> 00:31:36.024
Hey! Hey. where are they going?

572
00:31:36.024 --> 00:31:37.983
I don't know.
The obvious route

573
00:31:37.983 --> 00:31:40.028
to the first transition area
is this way.

574
00:31:40.028 --> 00:31:41.160
- You sure?
- Listen.

575
00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.509
who's the navigator here?

576
00:31:42.509 --> 00:31:43.814
You are. Chik. all right?
A few more miles.

577
00:31:43.814 --> 00:31:45.164
We knew the start
would be tough. Come on!

578
00:31:45.164 --> 00:31:46.687
Jeez. Chik.
it's just a question.

579
00:31:46.687 --> 00:31:48.036
You don't have
to be so sensitive.

580
00:31:54.869 --> 00:31:56.479
Rubes. you wanna see
something cool?

581
00:31:56.479 --> 00:31:58.090
Yeah.

582
00:31:58.090 --> 00:31:59.743
Okay. Come here. Okay.

583
00:32:02.224 --> 00:32:03.182
Look.

584
00:32:04.096 --> 00:32:05.924
- Dots.
- Not just dots.

585
00:32:06.576 --> 00:32:07.969
Daddy.

586
00:32:07.969 --> 00:32:09.753
See. they're wearing trackers.

587
00:32:09.753 --> 00:32:11.842
so we can watch
their every move.

588
00:32:12.843 --> 00:32:14.758
That is Daddy.

589
00:32:14.758 --> 00:32:17.152
- Go. Daddy dot.

590
00:32:17.979 --> 00:32:19.067
There he is!

591
00:32:36.737 --> 00:32:39.696
<i>Race Rockets. sixteenth place.</i>

592
00:32:48.967 --> 00:32:50.185
All right.
We're gonna get a quick bite.

593
00:32:50.185 --> 00:32:51.534
and then we're on to the bikes.

594
00:32:51.534 --> 00:32:52.709
- See the boxes?
- Yeah. yeah.

595
00:32:52.709 --> 00:32:53.841
- It's over there.
- Okay.

596
00:32:53.841 --> 00:32:55.408
Hey. hey. hey.

597
00:32:55.408 --> 00:32:56.844
How long ago
did the leaders come through?

598
00:32:56.844 --> 00:32:58.672
About an hour ago.
Team Arc'Teryx.

599
00:32:58.672 --> 00:33:00.195
Oh. yeah. Of course.

600
00:33:00.195 --> 00:33:01.501
Only an hour. it's not that bad.

601
00:33:03.546 --> 00:33:04.547
Shit.

602
00:33:06.027 --> 00:33:07.202
Chiki.

603
00:33:07.202 --> 00:33:08.856
Jungle meatballs?

604
00:33:08.856 --> 00:33:10.597
No way! No.

605
00:33:10.597 --> 00:33:12.642
Huh? You'll come around.

606
00:33:12.642 --> 00:33:14.514
I'm too old to come around.

607
00:33:14.514 --> 00:33:16.472
Yeah. people always
come around. Trust me.

608
00:33:16.472 --> 00:33:18.648
Oh. yeah.
Tell me about it.

609
00:33:18.648 --> 00:33:20.737
Tell me about it.

610
00:33:28.397 --> 00:33:29.790
What happened
to you. boy?

611
00:33:32.358 --> 00:33:33.446
Meatball?

612
00:33:35.622 --> 00:33:36.666
- All right.

613
00:33:36.666 --> 00:33:38.016
Suit yourself.

614
00:33:46.894 --> 00:33:47.895
You don't want one?

615
00:33:53.161 --> 00:33:54.815
Huh.

616
00:33:54.815 --> 00:33:56.077
What happened to you?

617
00:33:56.077 --> 00:33:57.426
You okay?

618
00:33:59.776 --> 00:34:01.517
You don't look so good. boy.

619
00:34:01.517 --> 00:34:04.129
- Sure you don't want it. huh?

620
00:34:05.652 --> 00:34:07.001
Go ahead. It's okay.

621
00:34:07.001 --> 00:34:08.916
- It's okay.

622
00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:10.831
Go ahead.

623
00:34:11.832 --> 00:34:13.921
There you go. Hey!

624
00:34:13.921 --> 00:34:15.531
Look. somebody likes
my meatballs.

625
00:34:15.531 --> 00:34:18.056
If I looked like that guy.
I'd eat them. too.

626
00:34:19.927 --> 00:34:21.102
Hey. sorry. buddy.
the rest are for me

627
00:34:21.102 --> 00:34:22.364
and my friend. all right?

628
00:34:24.105 --> 00:34:25.280
All right. 20 minutes. Let's go!

629
00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.542
- Okay!
- All right!

630
00:34:26.542 --> 00:34:27.935
<i>After the first leg
of the race.</i>

631
00:34:27.935 --> 00:34:30.111
<i>Team Broadrail takes
to the mountain bikes</i>

632
00:34:30.111 --> 00:34:31.852
<i>and finds themselves
trailing the leaders</i>

633
00:34:31.852 --> 00:34:33.506
<i>by a considerable amount.</i>

634
00:34:33.506 --> 00:34:34.724
Fun fact!

635
00:34:34.724 --> 00:34:36.291
Only part
of Christopher Columbus

636
00:34:36.291 --> 00:34:37.727
is buried here in the Dominican.

637
00:34:37.727 --> 00:34:39.729
The other part is in Spain.

638
00:34:39.729 --> 00:34:41.427
Well. this place
cut him in half. I guess. huh?

639
00:34:42.384 --> 00:34:43.733
Hey. Olivia!

640
00:34:43.733 --> 00:34:45.605
You ride pretty good
for a climber.

641
00:34:45.605 --> 00:34:47.781
You know. you ride
pretty good yourself. Leo.

642
00:34:47.781 --> 00:34:49.174
For an Instagram model.

643
00:34:49.174 --> 00:34:50.566
-Bye!

644
00:34:55.745 --> 00:34:59.184
Chiki. looks like
your knee's just fine. baby!

645
00:34:59.184 --> 00:35:00.750
Never better!

646
00:35:02.056 --> 00:35:04.232
- Oh. he came to play!
- See ya!

647
00:35:04.232 --> 00:35:06.234
-He got some wheels!

648
00:35:52.628 --> 00:35:54.108
Hey. Chik!

649
00:35:54.108 --> 00:35:55.283
Oh. shit.

650
00:35:55.283 --> 00:35:57.242
According to the map.
this is a trail.

651
00:35:58.939 --> 00:36:00.158
What do we do now?

652
00:36:02.116 --> 00:36:04.074
We climb.

653
00:36:04.074 --> 00:36:05.772
- What. with our bikes?
-Oh. yeah.

654
00:36:06.599 --> 00:36:07.556
Just follow me.

655
00:36:17.914 --> 00:36:19.525
This is crazy.

656
00:36:21.353 --> 00:36:23.529
Chik. I thought
you were all about shortcuts.

657
00:36:24.704 --> 00:36:26.445
Yeah. but I wanna
get there alive.

658
00:36:31.841 --> 00:36:32.886
Just breathe.

659
00:36:38.674 --> 00:36:39.980
You know.

660
00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:41.982
I think this calls
for a little selfie-time.

661
00:36:41.982 --> 00:36:43.853
-Leo. really?

662
00:36:43.853 --> 00:36:45.246
Whoa. whoa.
Hey. Chik. you all right?

663
00:36:45.246 --> 00:36:46.334
-Yeah.

664
00:36:46.334 --> 00:36:47.640
It's okay. You got it.

665
00:36:54.299 --> 00:36:56.301
-Almost there.

666
00:37:15.276 --> 00:37:17.626
Whoo!

667
00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:31.510
I thought
you'd given up climbing.

668
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:33.773
Old habits die hard
when you're awesome.

669
00:37:33.773 --> 00:37:35.470
Hey! This isn't
the route on the map.

670
00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:38.038
I told you.
It's a shortcut.

671
00:37:38.038 --> 00:37:40.345
Everyone else has to go
the long way around.

672
00:37:40.345 --> 00:37:42.390
- You sure this is gonna work?
-Not for a second.

673
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:44.610
Hey. what's <i>"peligro"</i> mean?

674
00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:46.568
It means "welcome"
in Spanish.

675
00:37:52.008 --> 00:37:53.619
Whoo.

676
00:37:53.619 --> 00:37:54.968
Oh. yeah.
Yeah.

677
00:37:54.968 --> 00:37:56.186
Oh. there we go.

678
00:37:56.186 --> 00:37:57.492
You have
your trolley. Leo?

679
00:37:58.406 --> 00:38:00.495
We sure about this?

680
00:38:00.495 --> 00:38:02.062
Well. it's adventure racing. right?

681
00:38:02.062 --> 00:38:03.193
Oh. yeah.

682
00:38:09.765 --> 00:38:12.159
How. uh... How long do you
think this has been here?

683
00:38:12.855 --> 00:38:15.118
I don't know.

684
00:38:15.118 --> 00:38:16.685
Don't worry. Chiki's gonna
be our guinea pig.

685
00:38:16.685 --> 00:38:18.121
-Of course.
- You follow him.

686
00:38:18.121 --> 00:38:19.558
and Olivia and I
will go up the rear.

687
00:38:19.558 --> 00:38:21.211
Got it.

688
00:38:21.211 --> 00:38:22.212
Well.
it's not that high.

689
00:38:23.039 --> 00:38:24.214
Wait till you get out there.

690
00:38:24.911 --> 00:38:25.955
I don't know. guys.

691
00:38:25.955 --> 00:38:27.261
This looks pretty unsafe to me.

692
00:38:27.261 --> 00:38:29.568
Only one way to find out.

693
00:38:29.568 --> 00:38:31.570
- Are you ready?
-Let 'er rip. Chiki.

694
00:38:33.876 --> 00:38:36.314
- Whoo!

695
00:38:36.314 --> 00:38:38.316
Yee-ha!

696
00:38:39.099 --> 00:38:40.927
Come on. Leo!

697
00:38:40.927 --> 00:38:42.407
Would you look at that.

698
00:38:42.407 --> 00:38:44.234
The old man's got a set
of church bells for nuts.

699
00:38:44.234 --> 00:38:45.627
-Whoo-ha!

700
00:38:47.412 --> 00:38:48.674
Go. Chiki!

701
00:38:48.674 --> 00:38:51.894
Yee-ha!

702
00:38:58.945 --> 00:38:59.946
Yeah!

703
00:39:01.121 --> 00:39:02.514
All right. Leo. you're up.
Let's go.

704
00:39:03.428 --> 00:39:05.255
Hey. Chiki. Watch this.

705
00:39:05.255 --> 00:39:06.648
This one's for you. baby.

706
00:39:07.823 --> 00:39:09.216
Yeah!

707
00:39:10.435 --> 00:39:11.697
<i>Whoo!</i>

708
00:39:11.697 --> 00:39:12.785
<i>Yeah!</i>

709
00:39:14.961 --> 00:39:17.398
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

710
00:39:17.398 --> 00:39:19.139
<i>Come on. Leo!</i>

711
00:39:19.139 --> 00:39:20.401
You can do it!

712
00:39:21.184 --> 00:39:22.534
Yeah. baby!

713
00:39:22.534 --> 00:39:24.274
How'd you like that. Michael?

714
00:39:25.841 --> 00:39:27.408
<i>Whoo-hoo-hoo!</i>

715
00:39:29.802 --> 00:39:30.846
Hey. Michael!

716
00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:33.588
How's my ass look. huh?

717
00:39:34.633 --> 00:39:35.895
Yeah.

718
00:39:36.635 --> 00:39:39.289
<i>Whoo!</i>

719
00:39:39.289 --> 00:39:41.379
All right. Olivia. you're up.
You're next.

720
00:39:41.379 --> 00:39:42.684
All right.

721
00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:06.012
This is beautiful!

722
00:40:21.723 --> 00:40:22.811
Olivia!

723
00:40:27.599 --> 00:40:28.643
Shit.

724
00:40:29.296 --> 00:40:30.384
Shit.

725
00:40:36.434 --> 00:40:37.783
Olivia. I'm coming!

726
00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:39.785
Shit.

727
00:40:43.223 --> 00:40:44.442
Here's Michael.

728
00:40:45.007 --> 00:40:46.052
Oh. man.

729
00:40:47.009 --> 00:40:49.011
Olivia. hold on!

730
00:40:51.187 --> 00:40:53.015
I'm okay!

731
00:40:53.015 --> 00:40:54.713
I'm not going anywhere. though!

732
00:41:00.675 --> 00:41:02.503
- I'm coming!

733
00:41:04.636 --> 00:41:06.507
Too fast. Michael!

734
00:41:06.507 --> 00:41:07.987
Fuck.

735
00:41:07.987 --> 00:41:09.815
Hit the brakes!

736
00:41:09.815 --> 00:41:11.469
Coming in a little hot.

737
00:41:13.383 --> 00:41:14.646
Ooh!

738
00:41:15.385 --> 00:41:16.909
Well.

739
00:41:16.909 --> 00:41:18.824
another nice office. huh?

740
00:41:18.824 --> 00:41:21.391
Yeah. I think I have to pee.

741
00:41:21.391 --> 00:41:22.697
Well. you might wanna hold that

742
00:41:22.697 --> 00:41:24.220
till we get you down. huh?

743
00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:25.787
Look. can you spin around
and go hand over hand?

744
00:41:25.787 --> 00:41:26.788
Uh...

745
00:41:28.355 --> 00:41:30.879
No. Cable's shot.

746
00:41:30.879 --> 00:41:32.054
I've got nothing to roll on.

747
00:41:32.054 --> 00:41:34.579
Shit. All right.

748
00:41:34.579 --> 00:41:37.190
Well. I'm gonna have
to get past you somehow.

749
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:38.408
How?

750
00:41:38.408 --> 00:41:40.193
Well.

751
00:41:40.193 --> 00:41:41.673
unfortunately. I'm gonna
have to unhook for a minute.

752
00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:43.631
Wait. what?

753
00:41:43.631 --> 00:41:45.285
Oh. God.

754
00:41:45.285 --> 00:41:47.592
All right. I'm gonna
unhook my carabiner.

755
00:41:47.592 --> 00:41:48.941
swing it past you.

756
00:41:48.941 --> 00:41:50.290
and then hook it back up. okay?

757
00:41:50.290 --> 00:41:51.639
Wait. Why? Why...

758
00:41:51.639 --> 00:41:53.119
While you dangle
with your bike beneath you?

759
00:41:53.119 --> 00:41:54.381
Well. hopefully. yeah.

760
00:41:54.381 --> 00:41:57.079
Well. that breaks
every rule of climbing.

761
00:41:57.079 --> 00:41:58.777
Well. it's a good thing
we're not climbing.

762
00:41:58.777 --> 00:41:59.821
All right. you ready?

763
00:42:02.476 --> 00:42:03.564
God!

764
00:42:03.564 --> 00:42:04.696
My wife would be so mad at me

765
00:42:04.696 --> 00:42:05.740
if she knew
I was up here right now.

766
00:42:21.539 --> 00:42:23.453
All right.

767
00:42:25.717 --> 00:42:27.283
Shit!

768
00:42:28.415 --> 00:42:29.895
- You good? You got it?
- Yeah. Yeah.

769
00:42:29.895 --> 00:42:31.287
- I'm good. I'm good.
- All right.

770
00:42:31.287 --> 00:42:33.072
That was easy.

771
00:42:36.031 --> 00:42:37.685
I can't...

772
00:42:37.685 --> 00:42:39.295
I can't get close enough to you.

773
00:42:39.295 --> 00:42:40.819
- It's too much of an incline.
- Well. maybe I can unhook

774
00:42:40.819 --> 00:42:42.037
and shimmy down to you.

775
00:42:42.037 --> 00:42:43.125
No. no.
The cable's too slippery.

776
00:42:45.214 --> 00:42:46.215
You know what?

777
00:42:47.477 --> 00:42:49.392
All right. I got an idea.

778
00:42:49.392 --> 00:42:50.480
It's gonna sound crazy.

779
00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:52.047
- but trust me.
- Okay.

780
00:42:52.047 --> 00:42:53.353
I'm gonna swing you my bike.

781
00:42:53.353 --> 00:42:54.920
- You attach to that. okay?
- Your bike?

782
00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:56.617
What? Uh...

783
00:42:56.617 --> 00:42:58.576
Uh. okay. I mean...

784
00:42:59.881 --> 00:43:01.013
That's crazy.

785
00:43:01.883 --> 00:43:03.189
Shit.

786
00:43:03.189 --> 00:43:04.973
All right. Ready?

787
00:43:05.539 --> 00:43:06.671
Yeah.

788
00:43:08.934 --> 00:43:10.283
- Again!
- Yeah.

789
00:43:10.283 --> 00:43:11.501
-Gotta grab it!

790
00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:13.286
Again!

791
00:43:14.548 --> 00:43:15.593
Come on!

792
00:43:17.943 --> 00:43:20.510
- I got it. I got it. Got it.
- Good catch.

793
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:21.642
All right. There you go.

794
00:43:24.384 --> 00:43:25.777
- There you go.
- I got it.

795
00:43:25.777 --> 00:43:27.692
- Yeah. Okay?
- Yeah.

796
00:43:31.217 --> 00:43:32.305
You all right?

797
00:43:33.262 --> 00:43:34.394
This will hold. right?

798
00:43:34.394 --> 00:43:36.570
- Yeah. no doubt.
- Yeah. no doubt?

799
00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:38.790
- Look. it's gonna hold.
- Uh. stop! Stop!

800
00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:40.226
I'm sorry.

801
00:43:40.226 --> 00:43:42.141
Look. You're gonna
have to release at some point.

802
00:43:42.707 --> 00:43:44.273
Okay?

803
00:43:44.273 --> 00:43:46.885
It sounds like it's crazy.
but trust me. it's gonna work.

804
00:43:46.885 --> 00:43:49.322
This is gonna put
a lot of force on your rig.

805
00:43:49.322 --> 00:43:51.367
I'm okay. Don't worry about me.

806
00:43:52.542 --> 00:43:54.283
Just take a deep breath.

807
00:43:54.283 --> 00:43:56.808
Whenever you're comfortable. release.

808
00:43:56.808 --> 00:43:58.636
All right.

809
00:44:04.685 --> 00:44:05.773
Okay.

810
00:44:11.866 --> 00:44:12.911
Ahh!

811
00:44:12.911 --> 00:44:14.956
Oh. shit.

812
00:44:14.956 --> 00:44:16.392
- All right.
- Go ahead.

813
00:44:16.392 --> 00:44:17.698
- Oh. God.
- Go!

814
00:44:17.698 --> 00:44:19.352
You sure this is gonna work?

815
00:44:19.352 --> 00:44:20.440
Ah!

816
00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:21.876
It's gonna work.

817
00:44:21.876 --> 00:44:23.269
It's not gonna feel good.

818
00:44:23.269 --> 00:44:25.271
- but it's gonna work.

819
00:44:25.271 --> 00:44:27.099
I got you. Okay?

820
00:44:27.099 --> 00:44:29.449
All right. I'll see you
on the other side. I hope.

821
00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:35.673
- Shit!

822
00:44:35.673 --> 00:44:37.587
Oh. shit! Oh. shit!

823
00:44:40.373 --> 00:44:41.766
I didn't think
you were gonna do it!

824
00:44:41.766 --> 00:44:43.158
- I didn't think you were

825
00:44:43.158 --> 00:44:44.420
- gonna do it!
- But we did it!

826
00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:46.161
-Holy shit!
- You all right?

827
00:44:46.161 --> 00:44:47.554
You're out of your mind.
you know that?

828
00:44:47.554 --> 00:44:48.729
Yeah.

829
00:44:48.729 --> 00:44:50.470
Don't tell my dad
about this. okay?

830
00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:52.080
I don't think
I would've done it!

831
00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:54.126
Oh. God. Oh. man.

832
00:44:54.126 --> 00:44:55.431
All right. all right. Let's go.

833
00:44:55.431 --> 00:44:56.955
- I gotta pee now. too.
-All right.

834
00:45:09.402 --> 00:45:10.925
- Okay.

835
00:45:10.925 --> 00:45:12.448
Easy!

836
00:45:12.448 --> 00:45:13.493
- Easy.
-We got you!

837
00:45:14.668 --> 00:45:16.583
Got you! Come on.
Up!

838
00:45:16.583 --> 00:45:18.150
Michael. don't detach
until we get her up.

839
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:20.108
I got her.
Hey. Hugo'd get a laugh

840
00:45:20.108 --> 00:45:21.719
- out of that one. huh?
-That was a first.

841
00:45:21.719 --> 00:45:22.763
-Come on!

842
00:45:29.248 --> 00:45:31.337
<i>An impressive move
by Team Broadrail</i>

843
00:45:31.337 --> 00:45:33.731
<i>to take the path less-traveled.</i>

844
00:45:33.731 --> 00:45:36.908
<i>They've significantly narrowed
the gap to Team Arc'Teryx.</i>

845
00:45:36.908 --> 00:45:39.171
<i>and they might be able
to conserve some energy here.</i>

846
00:45:41.695 --> 00:45:42.696
All right.
That's ten teams we just put

847
00:45:42.696 --> 00:45:44.437
in the rearview mirror. Chiki!

848
00:45:44.437 --> 00:45:46.308
Nice call on the zip line.
buddy!

849
00:45:46.308 --> 00:45:47.440
We're here!

850
00:45:49.224 --> 00:45:50.399
Team Broadrail!

851
00:45:51.618 --> 00:45:52.750
All right.

852
00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:54.099
Hey. Tough trek comin' up.

853
00:45:54.099 --> 00:45:55.753
- Get plenty to eat. all right?
-Oh. yeah.

854
00:45:55.753 --> 00:45:58.190
Hey. that old Chiki sure knows
how to keep those wits. huh?

855
00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:59.931

that Dominicans eat more rice
than any other Latin country?

870
00:46:34.443 --> 00:46:36.054
How do you know
all this random stuff?

871
00:46:36.054 --> 00:46:38.360
There's this new thing
called the Internet. Chik.

872
00:46:40.623 --> 00:46:41.799
All right. you wanna start
to embrace

873
00:46:41.799 --> 00:46:43.365
- the buckets of pain!

874
00:46:43.365 --> 00:46:44.976
- I need a bigger bucket.

875
00:46:46.412 --> 00:46:48.762
Come on. guys.
We got a race to win.

876
00:46:51.591 --> 00:46:53.723
You know what?

877
00:46:53.723 --> 00:46:55.290
Yeah. he's gonna end up
paying for that later.

878
00:46:56.335 --> 00:46:57.771
At our expense.

879
00:46:57.771 --> 00:46:59.294
He'll be laying on the ground
in a few minutes.

880
00:46:59.294 --> 00:47:00.382
Save your energy!

881
00:47:04.604 --> 00:47:05.692
Whoo!

882
00:47:08.521 --> 00:47:10.218
All right. Leo.
Check us in.

883
00:47:10.218 --> 00:47:12.786
Sixth! Sixth. Broadrail.

884
00:47:17.356 --> 00:47:18.618
It's over there!

885
00:47:18.618 --> 00:47:19.793
Here.

886
00:47:19.793 --> 00:47:22.056
- It's here.

887
00:47:22.056 --> 00:47:23.318
That wasn't
too bad. huh?

888
00:47:23.318 --> 00:47:24.406
Selfie.

889
00:47:24.406 --> 00:47:25.451
Now for the hard part.

890
00:47:25.451 --> 00:47:26.626
Yeah. funny.

891
00:47:28.584 --> 00:47:31.326
- Chik. Chik.
- Oh. thank you.

892
00:47:31.326 --> 00:47:33.546
Hey. I think we'll need
more than the hour of sleep

893
00:47:33.546 --> 00:47:35.156
we planned on. all right?

894
00:47:35.156 --> 00:47:36.984
We've had five hours
in three days.

895
00:47:36.984 --> 00:47:37.985
We really need more?

896
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:40.945
Take it easy. all right? Relax.

897
00:47:40.945 --> 00:47:42.598
- How're we doing?
-Four or five teams.

898
00:47:42.598 --> 00:47:43.904
- That's all I saw.
- Anybody head out yet?

899
00:47:43.904 --> 00:47:45.036
Not that I know of.

900
00:47:45.819 --> 00:47:48.039
Hey. guys. Look.

901
00:47:48.039 --> 00:47:49.823
- It's Team Arc'Teryx.
-What?

902
00:47:49.823 --> 00:47:50.998
You gotta be kidding me.

903
00:47:50.998 --> 00:47:52.173
- I thought we'd be

904
00:47:52.173 --> 00:47:53.305
way behind here.

905
00:47:53.305 --> 00:47:54.393
Yeah. well. we're not.

906
00:47:55.002 --> 00:47:56.308
Chiki?

907
00:47:56.308 --> 00:47:58.876
They're letting
everyone use GPS here.

908
00:47:58.876 --> 00:48:00.181
If we're willing
to take some chances.

909
00:48:00.181 --> 00:48:01.400
we can really put this away.

910
00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:02.618
What kind of chances?

911
00:48:02.618 --> 00:48:04.055
Whatever "chances" Chiki says.

912
00:48:04.055 --> 00:48:06.057
Yeah.
Whatever it takes. right?

913
00:48:06.057 --> 00:48:07.623
How much rest you need?

914
00:48:07.623 --> 00:48:09.364
Thirty-five minutes. okay?

915
00:48:09.364 --> 00:48:13.020
We're gonna take 35 minutes
to rest. That's it. Let's go.

916
00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:14.369
Lay down.

917
00:48:14.369 --> 00:48:16.110
Olivia. you good?
Yeah. I'm fine.

918
00:48:53.931 --> 00:48:55.845
<i>We're into
nighttime trekking now.</i>

919
00:48:55.845 --> 00:48:57.456
<i>which could be
much more dangerous</i>

920
00:48:57.456 --> 00:48:58.544
<i>for these athletes.</i>

921
00:48:58.544 --> 00:49:00.024
<i>especially with the bad weather</i>

922
00:49:00.024 --> 00:49:01.895
<i>that's expected in the area.</i>

923
00:49:12.601 --> 00:49:14.299
Hey. Chik.

924
00:49:14.299 --> 00:49:15.909
Did you see the list of things
to watch out for on this leg?

925
00:49:15.909 --> 00:49:17.606
No! Tell us. Deck!

926
00:49:17.606 --> 00:49:20.740
Crocodiles. tarantulas.
and snakes. Lots of snakes.

927
00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:21.959
You don't mind snakes.
do you. Chik?

928
00:49:21.959 --> 00:49:23.177
You know I hate snakes.

929
00:49:23.177 --> 00:49:24.352
Yeah.
must have forgotten.

930
00:49:24.352 --> 00:49:25.353
Well. keep a sharp eye.

931
00:49:33.971 --> 00:49:35.233
Oh. shit!

932
00:49:35.233 --> 00:49:36.582
- Hey. you all right?
-What is that?

933
00:49:36.582 --> 00:49:38.758
A snake! It's a snake!

934
00:49:38.758 --> 00:49:40.151
Oh. man!

935
00:49:43.632 --> 00:49:46.070
Yeah. it's a snake. all right.
It looks really poisonous!

936
00:49:46.070 --> 00:49:47.723
Shut up. Leo.
You better move!

937
00:49:47.723 --> 00:49:50.030
Looks real nasty!

938
00:49:54.078 --> 00:49:55.818
Another fun fact.

939
00:49:55.818 --> 00:49:57.733
During prohibition.
these trails were used

940
00:49:57.733 --> 00:50:00.432
to transport alcohol
made from sugarcane.

941
00:50:00.432 --> 00:50:02.869
I could use a pint
of anything right now.

942
00:50:04.262 --> 00:50:05.654
What is it?

943
00:50:05.654 --> 00:50:08.179
Nothing. Just twisted
my knee in the mud.

944
00:50:08.179 --> 00:50:10.311
What? Well. give me
your pack for a little bit.

945
00:50:10.311 --> 00:50:11.486
Take a break.

946
00:50:12.705 --> 00:50:14.272
Hey. It's okay!

947
00:50:17.318 --> 00:50:19.407
Give me the pack for a bit.
Take a break.

948
00:50:19.407 --> 00:50:21.018
I've never given up my pack.

949
00:50:24.238 --> 00:50:27.676
First time I've ever given up
my pack. man.

950
00:50:27.676 --> 00:50:29.374
Then blame me for the lack
of training. okay?

951
00:50:29.374 --> 00:50:30.679
Already am.

952
00:50:30.679 --> 00:50:32.594
Guys. what are we...
What are we doing here?

953
00:50:33.117 --> 00:50:34.161
Come on.

954
00:50:36.772 --> 00:50:37.904
You all right?

955
00:50:37.904 --> 00:50:39.993
-Shit.
- You okay?

956
00:50:39.993 --> 00:50:41.995
- Come here. Come here.

957
00:50:41.995 --> 00:50:43.649
Let's stop here
and check our gear.

958
00:50:43.649 --> 00:50:44.824
Oh. man. Sorry.

959
00:50:44.824 --> 00:50:46.130
Michael. we're losing time.

960
00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:48.306
I said let's just
check our gear. okay?

961
00:50:48.306 --> 00:50:51.309
- Take it easy.
-Yeah. sure. Whatever.

962
00:50:51.309 --> 00:50:52.701
Come on.
take all the time you need.

963
00:50:55.052 --> 00:50:56.662
What are you doing?

964
00:50:56.662 --> 00:50:59.491
Oh. I'm just documenting
this amazing journey.

965
00:50:59.491 --> 00:51:01.319
You know what?
Actually. that's a good idea.

966
00:51:01.319 --> 00:51:02.494
Let me get a shot
with you in it.

967
00:51:02.494 --> 00:51:04.235
- Yeah?
- Yeah. look at this light.

968
00:51:04.235 --> 00:51:05.888
It's gonna be amazing!
Come here.

969
00:51:05.888 --> 00:51:08.152
- Okay.
-It's cool. right?

970
00:51:11.416 --> 00:51:12.460
- Ready?
-Yeah.

971
00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:13.505
- Bye!
-Hey!

972
00:51:14.636 --> 00:51:15.985
The hell is the matter with you?

973
00:51:15.985 --> 00:51:17.117
Hey. what the hell
is your problem?

974
00:51:17.117 --> 00:51:18.205
What's it gonna be. Leo?

975
00:51:18.205 --> 00:51:19.424
The phone or the race?

976
00:51:19.424 --> 00:51:21.165
Are you stupid?
The phone is the race!

977
00:51:21.165 --> 00:51:22.601
No. Leo. it's not!

978
00:51:22.601 --> 00:51:23.645
Do you really think
we're gonna win this thing?

979
00:51:23.645 --> 00:51:24.907
Are you delusional?

980
00:51:24.907 --> 00:51:26.170
We are gonna win.
Even if I gotta drag

981
00:51:26.170 --> 00:51:27.475
or carry your ass
across the finish line.

982
00:51:27.475 --> 00:51:28.955
- we're gonna win.
-You're carrying me?

983
00:51:28.955 --> 00:51:30.957
Who's carrying who. huh?

984
00:51:30.957 --> 00:51:32.437
Who begged me
to be on their team

985
00:51:32.437 --> 00:51:34.526
because they couldn't
get a sponsor?

986
00:51:34.526 --> 00:51:36.528
No Leo. no money. Remember?

987
00:51:36.528 --> 00:51:38.573
I told you what you wanted
to hear to get you out here.

988
00:51:38.573 --> 00:51:39.922
I don't give a shit
about the sponsors.

989
00:51:39.922 --> 00:51:41.010
You're here now.
What are you gonna do?

990
00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:42.577
You gonna go home?
Go home. Walk!

991
00:51:42.577 --> 00:51:44.013
- I don't give a shit anymore.
-Guys.

992
00:51:44.013 --> 00:51:45.841
So sick and tired of you.
Such a friggin' liar.

993
00:51:45.841 --> 00:51:47.539
- Did you know about this?
-About what?

994
00:51:47.539 --> 00:51:48.627
Don't bullshit me!

995
00:51:48.627 --> 00:51:50.107
Did you know about Chik's knee?

996
00:51:50.107 --> 00:51:51.891
Yes. Yes. I did.

997
00:51:53.545 --> 00:51:55.982
So Decker knew exactly
what he was doing. huh?

998
00:51:55.982 --> 00:51:57.375
Yeah. you're so full of shit.
Michael.

999
00:51:57.375 --> 00:51:58.811
Give me the pack back.
Ignore him.

1000
00:51:58.811 --> 00:51:59.942
Give me the pack. Michael!

1001
00:51:59.942 --> 00:52:01.422
Ignore him!
I have the pack.

1002
00:52:01.422 --> 00:52:02.728
No. no! Give the legend
his pack back. Michael.

1003
00:52:02.728 --> 00:52:03.903
-Hey!
- You know as well as I do.

1004
00:52:03.903 --> 00:52:05.078
he'd run circles
around you with one leg!

1005
00:52:05.078 --> 00:52:06.514
- That's bullshit!
- Will you shut up?

1006
00:52:06.514 --> 00:52:07.863
- Stop it!
- We're not gonna win without

1007
00:52:07.863 --> 00:52:10.127
- Chiki. I know that for sure.

1008
00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:12.607
There's a dog.

1009
00:52:13.608 --> 00:52:14.653
What are you talking about?

1010
00:52:14.653 --> 00:52:15.784
There's the dog again.

1011
00:52:18.483 --> 00:52:21.050
That's the dog
I gave the meatballs to.

1012
00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:23.575
- You gave it food?
-Yeah.

1013
00:52:23.575 --> 00:52:25.446
Three days and 200 miles ago.

1014
00:52:28.101 --> 00:52:30.451
Look at his back.
It's been beaten.

1015
00:52:30.451 --> 00:52:31.452
You following us. boy?

1016
00:52:32.236 --> 00:52:34.151
That's impossible.

1017
00:52:34.151 --> 00:52:36.283
Go home.
You're gonna die out here.

1018
00:52:36.283 --> 00:52:37.719
Michael.
leave the stupid dog.

1019
00:52:37.719 --> 00:52:39.068
- and let's go. Come on.
-I can't stop him

1020
00:52:39.068 --> 00:52:40.722
- from following us!

1021
00:52:40.722 --> 00:52:42.071
We're already hours behind.

1022
00:52:42.071 --> 00:52:43.290
Chik has got one good leg.

1023
00:52:43.290 --> 00:52:44.770
and you're worried
about a stupid dog.

1024
00:52:44.770 --> 00:52:46.119
That thing will be dead
by morning.

1025
00:52:46.119 --> 00:52:47.468
Leo. nobody's
worrying about the dog.

1026
00:52:47.468 --> 00:52:49.078
I told you.
we're gonna win this.

1027
00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:52.081
Hey!

1028
00:52:52.081 --> 00:52:54.780
Come on. I'll keep your pack
for a little bit longer. okay?

1029
00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:55.998
GPS stage is coming up.

1030
00:52:55.998 --> 00:52:57.304
I can't navigate from the rear.

1031
00:52:57.304 --> 00:52:58.958
I'll do it. I can do it.

1032
00:52:58.958 --> 00:53:00.177
Good. good. Now let's get going.

1033
00:53:00.177 --> 00:53:01.613
- Can you walk?
-Yeah.

1034
00:53:01.613 --> 00:53:03.832
- All right. Let's get going.
-Go ahead. Go.

1035
00:53:03.832 --> 00:53:05.007
Come on.

1036
00:53:05.007 --> 00:53:06.574
Take your time.
Don't listen to him.

1037
00:53:32.557 --> 00:53:34.820
Is this thing telling me
to move faster?

1038
00:53:37.083 --> 00:53:38.215
Good job. dog.

1039
00:53:59.366 --> 00:54:00.846
Way to go. Michael.

1040
00:54:10.943 --> 00:54:13.206
Oh. great! More dogs.
Just what we need.

1041
00:54:18.777 --> 00:54:20.039
Look at him.

1042
00:54:20.039 --> 00:54:22.084
He doesn't even care
about the other dogs.

1043
00:54:22.084 --> 00:54:24.391
Okay. Lots of ups
and downs coming up.

1044
00:54:24.391 --> 00:54:27.351
but I can't...
I can't see a trail anywhere.

1045
00:54:27.351 --> 00:54:28.787
I was thinking.
through the forest.

1046
00:54:28.787 --> 00:54:29.875
Oh. yeah.

1047
00:54:29.875 --> 00:54:31.572
It's gonna
get hairy though.

1048
00:54:31.572 --> 00:54:33.052
Hey. Michael. Give me the pack.

1049
00:54:34.358 --> 00:54:35.663
You sure?
Yeah. I'm okay.

1050
00:54:37.186 --> 00:54:38.753
Yeah. over there. You see?

1051
00:54:54.639 --> 00:54:55.857
What do you think?

1052
00:54:55.857 --> 00:54:57.859
Well. we haven't
even gone a mile

1053
00:54:57.859 --> 00:54:59.426
in the last five hours.

1054
00:54:59.426 --> 00:55:02.603
I'm hoping we just cut
ten miles off the course.

1055
00:55:02.603 --> 00:55:03.691
Yeah. and that nobody else

1056
00:55:03.691 --> 00:55:04.866
has the balls to try this route.

1057
00:55:04.866 --> 00:55:06.215
Speak for yourself.

1058
00:55:06.215 --> 00:55:08.479
What is that? Is that a path?

1059
00:55:08.479 --> 00:55:10.350
It's the right
direction. guys.

1060
00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:12.047
What does it look like?
What do you think?

1061
00:55:12.047 --> 00:55:14.049
Looks pretty clear to me.
Come on!

1062
00:55:16.008 --> 00:55:17.052
Leo!

1063
00:55:19.272 --> 00:55:20.752
Leo.

1064
00:55:20.752 --> 00:55:22.144
-Come on. Olivia.

1065
00:55:22.144 --> 00:55:23.407
Let's go.

1066
00:55:29.413 --> 00:55:31.328
What's your problem? Hey. move.

1067
00:55:31.328 --> 00:55:32.894
- You dumb dog!
-Hey. Hey. hey. hey.

1068
00:55:34.548 --> 00:55:35.897
- What the hell's goin' on?
-Michael. would you move

1069
00:55:35.897 --> 00:55:36.942
your damn dog?

1070
00:55:37.464 --> 00:55:38.509
What is it. boy?

1071
00:55:39.205 --> 00:55:40.249
What's goin' on?

1072
00:55:42.730 --> 00:55:43.862
What's he doing?

1073
00:55:43.862 --> 00:55:44.993
I don't know.

1074
00:55:48.823 --> 00:55:50.869
Whoa. whoa. You feel that?

1075
00:55:52.392 --> 00:55:53.698
Air. Breeze.

1076
00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:55.352
You feel it?

1077
00:55:55.352 --> 00:55:56.875
- Yeah.
- Whoa. whoa.

1078
00:55:58.572 --> 00:56:00.531
-Oh. shit.

1079
00:56:08.713 --> 00:56:09.975
Did that dog just...

1080
00:56:09.975 --> 00:56:11.019
Oh. shit.

1081
00:56:12.238 --> 00:56:13.457
- Yeah.
-Damn it.

1082
00:56:13.935 --> 00:56:15.197
Damn!

1083
00:56:15.197 --> 00:56:17.025
-Huh?

1084
00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:19.419
Look at that.

1085
00:56:20.202 --> 00:56:21.682
Hey! Hey.

1086
00:56:21.682 --> 00:56:23.162
I told you it was a good idea
to bring him along.

1087
00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:28.907
Saved your ass.

1088
00:56:33.738 --> 00:56:35.827
Hey.

1089
00:56:37.698 --> 00:56:39.483
Extra meatballs for you.
my friend.

1090
00:56:40.484 --> 00:56:41.659
Thank you.

1091
00:56:43.487 --> 00:56:45.053
How about that. Chiki?

1092
00:56:45.053 --> 00:56:46.403
How did he know?

1093
00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:01.156
Can't believe I almost walked
right off that cliff.

1094
00:57:01.156 --> 00:57:02.419
Yeah. but you didn't.

1095
00:57:02.419 --> 00:57:04.290
Because of a dog.

1096
00:57:04.812 --> 00:57:06.858
That dog.

1097
00:57:06.858 --> 00:57:10.470
My wife lives
in a shack. so I can do this.

1098
00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:11.950
Is that crazy or what?

1099
00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:13.430
Well. she knows
what keeps you alive. Chiki.

1100
00:57:14.822 --> 00:57:16.694
We never had kids
because of it.

1101
00:57:17.912 --> 00:57:20.175
I'm pretty damn selfish
sometimes.

1102
00:57:20.175 --> 00:57:21.873
It will be nice to focus
on something else

1103
00:57:21.873 --> 00:57:22.917
when this is over.

1104
00:57:24.310 --> 00:57:26.007
Well. the ladies
at the mani-pedi place

1105
00:57:26.007 --> 00:57:27.313
are gonna love this.

1106
00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:29.315
Can you walk?

1107
00:57:30.882 --> 00:57:32.710
What are my options?

1108
00:57:33.885 --> 00:57:35.495
Well. the river helps.

1109
00:57:36.801 --> 00:57:38.106
Another trek over that ridge.

1110
00:57:38.106 --> 00:57:40.805
and there is another river
that we cross

1111
00:57:40.805 --> 00:57:42.459
that goes in between
here and there.

1112
00:57:42.459 --> 00:57:45.070
Doesn't look any easier
than what we just did. though.

1113
00:57:45.070 --> 00:57:46.593
Well. at least it's light out.

1114
00:57:46.593 --> 00:57:48.203
- Yeah.
- How's the food situation?

1115
00:57:49.161 --> 00:57:50.292
A few bars.

1116
00:57:50.292 --> 00:57:51.816
It won't last us the. what.

1117
00:57:51.816 --> 00:57:53.382
five hours we have left
of this section?

1118
00:57:53.382 --> 00:57:55.080
- At least.
-Right.

1119
00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:57.778
- Chiki.
-What?

1120
00:57:57.778 --> 00:57:59.998
- How's that dog here?
- What do you mean?

1121
00:58:01.565 --> 00:58:03.175
How did that dog get here?

1122
00:58:07.048 --> 00:58:09.573
Look. this is where I fed
the dog at TA One. right?

1123
00:58:09.573 --> 00:58:11.096
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

1124
00:58:11.096 --> 00:58:12.489
This is where he met
back up with us.

1125
00:58:12.967 --> 00:58:14.099
Right there.

1126
00:58:14.882 --> 00:58:15.927
How the hell did he get

1127
00:58:15.927 --> 00:58:17.232
all the way from here to there?

1128
00:58:17.232 --> 00:58:19.408
Right? While we were on bikes.

1129
00:58:19.408 --> 00:58:22.107
and zip lines. and hiking.
and running. and climbing.

1130
00:58:22.107 --> 00:58:24.196
Now. how the hell
did he do that?

1131
00:58:24.196 --> 00:58:25.893
He must have wings
we don't know about.

1132
00:58:25.893 --> 00:58:27.329
Yeah.
that was my first guess.

1133
00:58:29.157 --> 00:58:30.507
Where you going. boy?

1134
00:58:32.552 --> 00:58:34.511
Hey! What're you doing?

1135
00:58:34.511 --> 00:58:36.338
Hey. We should go. too.

1136
00:58:37.209 --> 00:58:38.732
Yeah.

1137
00:58:38.732 --> 00:58:40.604
Maybe he's done
all for us he can.

1138
00:58:42.170 --> 00:58:43.389
Yeah. I hate to say it.

1139
00:58:43.389 --> 00:58:45.478
but it's one less mouth
to feed. right?

1140
00:58:46.653 --> 00:58:48.133
Yeah. I guess.

1141
00:58:48.133 --> 00:58:49.830
Guess we should just go. huh?

1142
00:58:49.830 --> 00:58:52.093
Save the food
for a couple hours from now.

1143
00:58:55.662 --> 00:58:57.446
Chik. how's the knee?

1144
00:58:57.446 --> 00:58:59.405
What are my options?

1145
00:59:02.930 --> 00:59:04.410
Oh. shit.
Easy.

1146
00:59:04.410 --> 00:59:07.718
Michael. he saved our lives.

1147
00:59:07.718 --> 00:59:09.197
All right? We'll always
remember that.

1148
00:59:10.285 --> 00:59:11.286
Yeah.

1149
00:59:33.395 --> 00:59:34.832
Wait! Hey.

1150
00:59:34.832 --> 00:59:36.529
- He came back.
-Yeah!

1151
00:59:36.529 --> 00:59:38.009
Wonder what he was doing.

1152
00:59:38.009 --> 00:59:39.967
I guess a dog's gotta do
what a dog's gotta do. huh?

1153
00:59:39.967 --> 00:59:41.969
He's a gentleman! Good boy.

1154
00:59:45.799 --> 00:59:47.061
He's just like a bear.

1155
00:59:47.888 --> 00:59:49.150
He shits in the woods.

Yeah!

1164
01:00:18.702 --> 01:00:20.181
I thought you love pain.

1165
01:00:20.181 --> 01:00:21.748
No.
I just love to hate it.

1166
01:00:21.748 --> 01:00:23.750

01:00:54.389 --> 01:00:56.000
Get him up here. Come on.

1184
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.654
- We'll lay him down over here.
-You all right?

1185
01:00:57.654 --> 01:00:59.830
- I think he's dehydrated.

1186
01:00:59.830 --> 01:01:01.658
- We got you. Okay.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

1187
01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:02.746
We'll get him
some water.

1188
01:01:02.746 --> 01:01:04.269
Get some food in him.

1189
01:01:04.269 --> 01:01:05.879
Got him?
Pack. Pack.

1190
01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:08.055
A little rest right here.

1191
01:01:08.055 --> 01:01:09.448
All right. and then
I'll be fine. guys. really.

1192
01:01:09.448 --> 01:01:11.102
Lay down.

1193
01:01:11.102 --> 01:01:12.799
Come on. There you go.

1194
01:01:13.887 --> 01:01:15.106
Shit.

1195
01:01:15.106 --> 01:01:16.585
Just give me some water.
I'll be fine.

1196
01:01:17.761 --> 01:01:19.501
- I need some water.
-Go slow.

1197
01:01:19.501 --> 01:01:21.112
Chiki.

1198
01:01:21.112 --> 01:01:22.766
Are you cramping
or light-headed?

1199
01:01:22.766 --> 01:01:24.811
I'm fine. really.
I just got a little dizzy.

1200
01:01:24.811 --> 01:01:26.030
Let's see if he can
eat something too.

1201
01:01:26.030 --> 01:01:27.161
if he can hold anything down.

1202
01:01:27.161 --> 01:01:29.250
Yeah. that's a good idea.

1203
01:01:29.250 --> 01:01:30.425
- You got something?
- You okay?

1204
01:01:30.425 --> 01:01:32.123
-All right.
- Hey. Chik.

1205
01:01:32.863 --> 01:01:33.907
He'll be okay.

1206
01:01:35.169 --> 01:01:36.388
You're gonna need
more than just that.

1207
01:01:36.388 --> 01:01:38.303
No. No. No.
IV is a four-hour penalty.

1208
01:01:38.303 --> 01:01:39.434
- I'm not doin' it.
-No. no. no.

1209
01:01:39.434 --> 01:01:40.566
Just eat a little bit of food.

1210
01:01:40.566 --> 01:01:41.828
See if you can
hold something down

1211
01:01:41.828 --> 01:01:43.743
- in your stomach. okay?
- Oh. where's my bag?

1212
01:01:43.743 --> 01:01:44.831
Where's my bag?

1213
01:01:44.831 --> 01:01:46.833
See? Ask and you shall receive.

1214
01:01:46.833 --> 01:01:48.705
Hey. meatballs.
I forgot I put these in there.

1215
01:01:53.797 --> 01:01:55.146
Eat.

1216
01:01:55.146 --> 01:01:56.147
Hey. guys.

1217
01:01:57.322 --> 01:01:58.323
What do you think
he went through

1218
01:01:58.323 --> 01:01:59.541
before he met us?

1219
01:01:59.541 --> 01:02:01.065
Whatever it was.
it wasn't good.

1220
01:02:01.065 --> 01:02:02.501
Hasn't eaten
since I fed him yesterday.

1221
01:02:02.501 --> 01:02:03.676
but he just sits there.

1222
01:02:04.590 --> 01:02:06.244
Smelling those meatballs.

1223
01:02:06.244 --> 01:02:08.768
not begging. letting us all eat.

1224
01:02:10.074 --> 01:02:11.031
Like a king.

1225
01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:14.078
You know what?

1226
01:02:14.948 --> 01:02:16.428
Give me some meatballs.

1227
01:02:16.428 --> 01:02:17.472
There.

1228
01:02:20.084 --> 01:02:21.433
There we go.

1229
01:02:21.433 --> 01:02:22.477
Look at that.

1230
01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:29.006
Look at that.
A meal fit for a king.

1231
01:02:29.746 --> 01:02:30.834
You know what?

1232
01:02:30.834 --> 01:02:32.487
I think we should
call him Arthur.

1233
01:02:33.924 --> 01:02:34.968
Huh?

1234
01:02:34.968 --> 01:02:36.230
Arthur the King.

1235
01:02:37.231 --> 01:02:38.537
And Leo the Prince.

1236
01:02:38.537 --> 01:02:40.495
- Huh?

1237
01:02:40.495 --> 01:02:42.062
Get out of my face. Michael.
Let's go.

1238
01:02:42.062 --> 01:02:43.194
You gonna be all right?

1239
01:02:43.194 --> 01:02:44.456
I'm good. I'm good.
Let's go.

1240
01:02:44.456 --> 01:02:45.718
- All right.
-I'm good.

1241
01:02:45.718 --> 01:02:46.850
- Come on. Let's head out.
-Eat. Eat.

1242
01:02:46.850 --> 01:02:48.242
-Get it while you can.
- Hey.

1243
01:02:48.242 --> 01:02:49.504
- We'll catch up. all right?
-Yeah. Yeah.

1244
01:02:49.504 --> 01:02:51.115
Take your time.
Come on.

1245
01:03:03.214 --> 01:03:04.868
Hey.

1246
01:03:04.868 --> 01:03:06.130
This is for saving my life.

1247
01:03:24.191 --> 01:03:26.411
Hey. Michael.
I think your dog likes me.

1248
01:03:26.411 --> 01:03:27.804
He's worried about you.

1249
01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:28.979
We're all worried about you.

1250
01:03:30.154 --> 01:03:31.285
I didn't eat the meatballs.

1251
01:03:31.285 --> 01:03:32.504
- What?
-What?

1252
01:03:32.504 --> 01:03:34.593
He saved me. okay? I owed him.

1253
01:03:34.593 --> 01:03:36.160
Are you crazy? You needed those.

1254
01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:37.422
How far to the TA?

1255
01:03:37.988 --> 01:03:39.250
Across the...

1256
01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:40.686
A mile up the river.
and then we're there.

1257
01:03:40.686 --> 01:03:42.035
Let's just get him
in the water and cool him off.

1258
01:03:42.035 --> 01:03:43.080
- Come on.
-Yeah.

1259
01:03:43.602 --> 01:03:44.603
Come on. boy.

1260
01:03:45.169 --> 01:03:46.170
Come on.

1261
01:03:47.214 --> 01:03:48.476
- Hey. Chik?
-Yeah.

1262
01:03:48.476 --> 01:03:49.738
Do the rules
say we can cross

1263
01:03:49.738 --> 01:03:51.262
- the river by boat?
-Sure they do.

1264
01:03:51.262 --> 01:03:53.133
Decker and I did it
in Costa Rica.

1265
01:03:56.615 --> 01:03:58.486
There's a boat!
<i>Hola!</i>

1266
01:03:58.486 --> 01:04:00.837
<i>Senor.</i> wait! Hey! Hello!

1267
01:04:01.446 --> 01:04:02.534
Michael.

1268
01:04:02.534 --> 01:04:04.666
Arthur's looking as bad as Leo.

1269
01:04:04.666 --> 01:04:06.059
-Come on. Come on.
- Sit him down.

1270
01:04:06.059 --> 01:04:07.408
Hold on. Hold on.

1271
01:04:07.408 --> 01:04:08.540
You know what
your problem is. Michael?

1272
01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:09.802
Come on. Sit. sit. sit.

1273
01:04:09.802 --> 01:04:11.108
You don't listen
to anybody.

1274
01:04:12.065 --> 01:04:13.197
Drink. Drink.

1275
01:04:13.197 --> 01:04:14.459
You can be
a real asshole sometimes.

1276
01:04:14.459 --> 01:04:16.678
Yeah. Leo. I know.
You. too. by the way.

1277
01:04:16.678 --> 01:04:18.115
- He's getting delirious.

1278
01:04:18.115 --> 01:04:19.377
- this guy.
- Yeah. no shit.

1279
01:04:19.377 --> 01:04:20.900
We need to get him
to the Transition Area.

1280
01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:22.554
otherwise we're in real trouble.

1281
01:04:22.554 --> 01:04:24.643
Hey. why don't you try
to stop that boat? All right?

1282
01:04:24.643 --> 01:04:25.949
-Yeah.

1283
01:04:25.949 --> 01:04:27.167
Give them the war money.
Whatever they want.

1284
01:04:27.167 --> 01:04:28.168
Okay!

1285
01:04:29.256 --> 01:04:31.171
Come here. buddy. You okay? Hey.

1286
01:04:31.171 --> 01:04:32.433
Not too much further.
okay. buddy?

1287
01:04:34.044 --> 01:04:36.089
Oh. God.

1288
01:04:36.089 --> 01:04:37.699
He's starting to smell
like rotten flesh.

1289
01:04:37.699 --> 01:04:39.658
This dog needs a vet.

1290
01:04:39.658 --> 01:04:41.007
Hey! Hey. hey.

1291
01:04:41.007 --> 01:04:42.487
No pictures of me like this
on Instagram.

1292
01:04:42.487 --> 01:04:43.792
Don't worry.

1293
01:04:43.792 --> 01:04:45.098
Nobody's worrying
about you on Instagram.

1294
01:04:45.098 --> 01:04:46.186
Just get us on that boat.

1295
01:04:46.186 --> 01:04:47.405
She's gonna take us across.

1296
01:04:47.405 --> 01:04:48.667
All right. great.
Help is on the way.

1297
01:04:48.667 --> 01:04:50.016
- Let's go. Come on.
-Yes. come on!

1298
01:04:50.016 --> 01:04:51.583
- Come on. We did it.
-How much?

1299
01:04:51.583 --> 01:04:52.976
No charge.
She saw us. and I think

1300
01:04:52.976 --> 01:04:54.847
- she felt sorry for us.
- What?

1301
01:04:54.847 --> 01:04:56.066
Are you okay?
Yeah.

1302
01:04:56.066 --> 01:04:57.241
Great job.
Thank you.

1303
01:04:57.241 --> 01:04:58.416
High school Spanish. you know?

1304
01:04:58.416 --> 01:04:59.896
Drink. Drink!

1305
01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:01.158
-I'm okay.
- Don't worry. you're okay.

1306
01:05:01.158 --> 01:05:02.072
- That's a nice boat.
- Have some more water.

1307
01:05:02.072 --> 01:05:03.073
Open up.

1308
01:05:04.726 --> 01:05:05.945
- All right. Come on.

1309
01:05:05.945 --> 01:05:07.164
- Get him on.
-Leo first.

1310
01:05:07.164 --> 01:05:09.340
Get him on.
Get in. Okay. sit.

1311
01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:10.558
All right. come on. boy.

1312
01:05:10.558 --> 01:05:13.170
Come on. Get him on. Get him on.

1313
01:05:13.170 --> 01:05:15.259
Okay. All right.
come on. boy. Get in.

1314
01:06:00.304 --> 01:06:03.220
<i>Team Broadrail
has traveled over 200 miles</i>

1315
01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:05.352
<i>and they found a companion.</i>

1316
01:06:05.352 --> 01:06:07.093
<i>That canine is looking stronger</i>

1317
01:06:07.093 --> 01:06:09.356
<i>than some of the team members
at this point.</i>

1318
01:06:09.356 --> 01:06:11.010
Hey. medic! We need a medic!

1319
01:06:11.010 --> 01:06:12.403
Here! Here.

1320
01:06:14.971 --> 01:06:16.102
- Here.
- Dehydration.

1321
01:06:16.102 --> 01:06:17.190
I can get fluids in him orally.

1322
01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:18.626
but he really should have an IV.

1323
01:06:18.626 --> 01:06:19.932
No. that's four hours
we can't afford.

1324
01:06:19.932 --> 01:06:21.629
Well. theoretically.
we can just go.

1325
01:06:21.629 --> 01:06:22.804
He can rest.
and we can paddle him.

1326
01:06:22.804 --> 01:06:24.241
I can paddle. I can paddle.

1327
01:06:24.241 --> 01:06:25.938
- Hey. Where is everybody else?
- You're the first.

1328
01:06:25.938 --> 01:06:27.026
What?
What?

1329
01:06:27.026 --> 01:06:28.288
We're the first team here?

1330
01:06:28.288 --> 01:06:30.421
By a lot. from what
I've been hearing.

1331
01:06:30.421 --> 01:06:31.509
Team Arc'Teryx is next.

1332
01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:34.207
- Your idea worked.
-Hey.

1333
01:06:34.207 --> 01:06:36.296
You guided us. We made it.

1334
01:06:37.950 --> 01:06:39.952
We can do this.
Leo. hey.

1335
01:06:41.301 --> 01:06:42.433
-Give me 20 minutes.
- Relax.

1336
01:06:42.433 --> 01:06:43.564
-I got it.
- Relax. relax.

1337
01:06:43.564 --> 01:06:45.001
-I can paddle. I swear.
- Relax.

1338
01:06:45.436 --> 01:06:46.698
Relax.

1339
01:06:46.698 --> 01:06:48.265
Now just look at me. okay?
Let me see you.

1340
01:06:49.570 --> 01:06:51.224
- You okay?
-I'm fine.

1341
01:06:51.224 --> 01:06:52.573
- I'm fine.
-No. no. Look at me.

1342
01:06:52.573 --> 01:06:54.532
Just give me 20 minutes.
I'll be back on my feet.

1343
01:06:54.532 --> 01:06:56.186
Just give me some water.

1344
01:06:56.186 --> 01:06:57.839
- How you feeling right now?
- I can paddle. I'm all right.

1345
01:06:59.102 --> 01:07:00.451
No. you're not. All right?

1346
01:07:00.451 --> 01:07:01.800
I'm not giving you
a voice on this one.

1347
01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:03.541
- Give him the IV. okay?
-Michael. no!

1348
01:07:03.541 --> 01:07:05.151
Listen to me. pal.

1349
01:07:05.151 --> 01:07:06.457
We've been
through a lot together.

1350
01:07:06.457 --> 01:07:08.546
And for once.
I am going to listen to you.

1351
01:07:08.546 --> 01:07:11.244
All right? Remember
you said "winners win"?

1352
01:07:11.244 --> 01:07:12.898
I need you healthy to do that.

1353
01:07:12.898 --> 01:07:14.291
Okay?

1354
01:07:14.291 --> 01:07:16.336
I got you. Leo.
You're one of us.

1355
01:07:16.336 --> 01:07:17.729
Just calm down. Relax.

1356
01:07:17.729 --> 01:07:19.861
Guys. look.

1357
01:07:19.861 --> 01:07:21.080
we're gonna get
four hours of rest

1358
01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:22.603
that the other teams won't have.

1359
01:07:22.603 --> 01:07:24.083
and we get a healthy Leo.
All right?

1360
01:07:24.083 --> 01:07:25.476
Even if they come
and they go out right away.

1361
01:07:25.476 --> 01:07:26.694
they're gonna be hurting.

1362
01:07:26.694 --> 01:07:28.609
We can catch them
on a 14-hour paddle.

1363
01:07:28.609 --> 01:07:29.958
This is our time. okay?

1364
01:07:29.958 --> 01:07:31.221
Yeah.

1365
01:07:31.221 --> 01:07:32.570
Excuse me. miss?
Mm-hmm.

1366
01:07:32.570 --> 01:07:34.006
Do you have a vet here?
Somebody who could take

1367
01:07:34.006 --> 01:07:35.268
a look at this guy for me
when you get a chance?

1368
01:07:35.268 --> 01:07:37.053
Sorry.
we don't have any vets.

1369
01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:38.184
You gotta be kidding me.

1370
01:07:38.184 --> 01:07:39.359
- Hey. Leo.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1371
01:07:39.359 --> 01:07:40.708
No. no. Don't be sorry.

1372
01:07:40.708 --> 01:07:43.363
Thank you.
Thank you for trusting me.

1373
01:07:43.363 --> 01:07:45.191
We got this now. Okay?

1374
01:07:45.191 --> 01:07:46.671
Come on. Get the rest you need.

1375
01:07:46.671 --> 01:07:48.064
You come and finish strong.
all right?

1376
01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:50.675
Relax. Here's when you step up.

1377
01:07:50.675 --> 01:07:52.155
All right.
everybody get some rest.

1378
01:07:55.767 --> 01:07:57.116
- Okay. buddy. Easy. easy.

1379
01:07:57.116 --> 01:07:58.900
Easy. easy. easy.

1380
01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:00.380
Oh. yeah. Easy.

1381
01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:01.990
Just cleaning up
a little bit. okay?

1382
01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:03.601
-Hey.
- Hey.

1383
01:08:03.601 --> 01:08:04.819
How's Arthur doing?

1384
01:08:05.559 --> 01:08:06.691
Mm. hard to tell.

1385
01:08:07.692 --> 01:08:10.390
- How's Leo?
- He's sleeping.

1386
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:12.610
But he looks human again.

1387
01:08:12.610 --> 01:08:13.959
Well. that's good.

1388
01:08:13.959 --> 01:08:15.221
It was the right thing to do.

1389
01:08:15.221 --> 01:08:16.309
Yeah.

1390
01:08:17.963 --> 01:08:19.095
You okay?

1391
01:08:20.922 --> 01:08:21.967
Yeah.

1392
01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:24.752
When did you find out
about your father?

1393
01:08:25.405 --> 01:08:26.493
Eight months ago.

1394
01:08:28.887 --> 01:08:29.975
Pancreas.

1395
01:08:31.542 --> 01:08:33.109
They. uh...

1396
01:08:34.153 --> 01:08:35.241
They gave him a year.

1397
01:08:36.982 --> 01:08:40.638
I swore that after he. uh...

1398
01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:44.685
that I wouldn't do
any of this again.

1399
01:08:46.078 --> 01:08:47.601
Not without him.

1400
01:08:47.601 --> 01:08:50.300
Maybe that's why
he told you to race.

1401
01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:51.779
What more could he ask
to leave behind

1402
01:08:51.779 --> 01:08:53.607
in this world than... than you?

1403
01:08:54.565 --> 01:08:56.044
Right? Doing what you both love?

1404
01:08:57.307 --> 01:09:00.310
Yeah.

1405
01:09:00.310 --> 01:09:02.921
- He was right to make me come.
- I'm glad you did.

1406
01:09:04.662 --> 01:09:06.794
- All right.
- Keep an eye on Leo.

1407
01:09:06.794 --> 01:09:07.882
- Get some rest.
- Yeah.

1408
01:09:07.882 --> 01:09:08.970
All right? And something to eat.

1409
01:09:08.970 --> 01:09:10.102
- Yeah.
- We'll be going soon.

1410
01:09:10.624 --> 01:09:11.625
Okay. buddy.

1411
01:09:12.539 --> 01:09:13.540
Hey.

1412
01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:18.154
Hell of a last race.

1413
01:09:19.503 --> 01:09:20.504
Yeah.

1414
01:09:26.118 --> 01:09:27.554
Go get some ice on that knee.

1415
01:09:29.513 --> 01:09:31.471
Why the hell
weren't we here earlier?

1416
01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.084
The truth?

1417
01:09:39.697 --> 01:09:41.089
The truth is
none of the sponsors

1418
01:09:41.089 --> 01:09:42.569
would give me the money
I needed to come earlier.

1419
01:09:45.703 --> 01:09:46.965
Also. the truth is...

1420
01:09:48.793 --> 01:09:50.229
I spent 25 grand of my own money

1421
01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:52.753
for the time
that we did have here.

1422
01:09:52.753 --> 01:09:54.842
Out of your own pocket?

1423
01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:56.801
Um...

1424
01:09:57.802 --> 01:09:59.238
My wife's pocket.

1425
01:09:59.238 --> 01:10:02.198
My wife's savings.
My family's savings.

1426
01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:03.329
Helen knows about this?

1427
01:10:04.852 --> 01:10:06.332
Chiki. this is my last chance.

1428
01:10:08.813 --> 01:10:10.162
That's it for me.

1429
01:10:13.383 --> 01:10:14.862
That's about the stupidest thing

1430
01:10:14.862 --> 01:10:16.168
I've ever heard.

1431
01:10:16.647 --> 01:10:17.691
I know.

1432
01:10:19.432 --> 01:10:20.868
Helen? Really?

1433
01:10:22.609 --> 01:10:24.742
I always thought that
she was the smart one.

1434
01:10:24.742 --> 01:10:26.787
Yeah. well. she married me.
didn't she?

1435
01:10:26.787 --> 01:10:29.747
Oh. yeah. I forget this part.

1436
01:10:33.272 --> 01:10:35.100
That should have been
a dead giveaway.

1437
01:10:42.281 --> 01:10:45.632
Why the hell would you
put your family in jeopardy?

1438
01:10:45.632 --> 01:10:46.938
Just to win a race?

1439
01:10:47.591 --> 01:10:49.201
For a trophy?

1440
01:10:49.201 --> 01:10:51.203
Your real trophies are at home

1441
01:10:51.203 --> 01:10:53.336
waiting for you
to come back to them.

1442
01:10:53.336 --> 01:10:54.772
Now. that's a legacy. man.

1443
01:10:59.777 --> 01:11:01.692
Hey.

1444
01:11:01.692 --> 01:11:04.129
- I got your favorite.
- Oh. hell no.

1445
01:11:04.129 --> 01:11:07.045
My last race meal is not
gonna be those damn things.

1446
01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:10.918
You'll come around.

1447
01:11:10.918 --> 01:11:13.704
I keep it for you
and the King.

1448
01:11:14.357 --> 01:11:15.967
- Hey.
- What?

1449
01:11:15.967 --> 01:11:17.795
Be ready to go.

1450
01:11:17.795 --> 01:11:20.319
No worries.
I'll be ready when you are.

1451
01:11:31.896 --> 01:11:33.724
You're so gentle. Wow.

1452
01:11:34.377 --> 01:11:35.900
Hey. PAW Patrol.

1453
01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:37.205
Gonna sit there all day.
or are we gonna

1454
01:11:37.205 --> 01:11:39.295
- go win this thing?
- Wow. Sleeping Beauty.

1455
01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:40.513
You're alive.

1456
01:11:40.513 --> 01:11:42.298
You look good.
How are you feeling?

1457
01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:44.778
Feel good. Feel ready.

1458
01:11:44.778 --> 01:11:46.998
- Wow. look who's there.

1459
01:11:46.998 --> 01:11:48.434
They look kinda tired.

1460
01:11:48.434 --> 01:11:49.740
You don't.
You're looking strong.

1461
01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:52.133
- You ready?
- Oh. yeah.

1462
01:11:52.133 --> 01:11:53.874
Guys.
what took you so long?

1463
01:11:53.874 --> 01:11:55.398
I was worried about you.
I thought you got lost.

1464
01:11:55.398 --> 01:11:58.314
Don't get excited. Michael.

1465
01:11:58.314 --> 01:11:59.619
We knew you guys had a penalty.

1466
01:11:59.619 --> 01:12:00.881
so we decided to go easy.

1467
01:12:00.881 --> 01:12:02.318
Make it a sporting race
to the finish.

1468
01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:03.754
I was just worried.
You know. no Chiki.

1469
01:12:03.754 --> 01:12:05.364
I thought maybe you took
a wrong turn. I don't know.

1470
01:12:05.364 --> 01:12:07.366
Huh. Don't worry about me. baby.

1471
01:12:07.366 --> 01:12:08.933
You know what. Decker?

1472
01:12:08.933 --> 01:12:11.239
- You look like shit.
-Yeah.

1473
01:12:11.239 --> 01:12:13.720
Says the guy
who can't walk properly.

1474
01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:15.331
You carry the old man's pack.
like I said?

1475
01:12:15.331 --> 01:12:17.333
I needed some help.
What's the problem?

1476
01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:18.682
I was honored to do it.

1477
01:12:20.292 --> 01:12:22.468
Ah. the famous dog.

1478
01:12:22.468 --> 01:12:24.557
Looks even worse
than the rest of you.

1479
01:12:24.557 --> 01:12:26.037
His name is Arthur.

1480
01:12:26.037 --> 01:12:27.081
Cute.

1481
01:12:28.735 --> 01:12:29.954
Maybe you all
deserve each other.

1482
01:12:29.954 --> 01:12:31.521
Yeah. Yeah. we do.

1483
01:12:32.826 --> 01:12:34.001
He's hurting.

1484
01:12:34.001 --> 01:12:35.612
- Out of gas.
- He's feeling it.

1485
01:12:35.612 --> 01:12:36.917
This is our chance. man.

1486
01:12:36.917 --> 01:12:38.310
All right. time to go.

1487
01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:41.487
Hey. buddy.
Hey. come on. You okay?

1488
01:12:41.487 --> 01:12:43.054
Come on. Come on. we need you.

1489
01:12:43.054 --> 01:12:45.665
You can do this. Let's go.
All right. guys. listen.

1490
01:12:45.665 --> 01:12:48.364
We got food. water.
and gear for 14 hours.

1491
01:12:48.364 --> 01:12:49.843
but only gotta be
out there for 12.

1492
01:12:49.843 --> 01:12:51.062
And then a short trek.
And by trek.

1493
01:12:51.062 --> 01:12:52.411
I mean run. to the finish.

1494
01:12:52.411 --> 01:12:53.760
- Okay?
- Damn right.

1495
01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:56.241
Okay? This is it.
This is the time.

1496
01:12:56.241 --> 01:12:57.677
It's an opportunity
of a lifetime.

1497
01:12:57.677 --> 01:12:59.766
We take it. We take it now.
All right? Hey. buddy.

1498
01:12:59.766 --> 01:13:01.768
- Come on. Arthur. I need you.

1499
01:13:01.768 --> 01:13:03.117
I need you. King.
You're gonna lead the way.

1500
01:13:04.031 --> 01:13:05.685
All right. Let's go. Come on.

1501
01:13:06.599 --> 01:13:08.035
Come on. boy. Let's go.

1502
01:13:08.035 --> 01:13:09.863
- Let's go.
-Let's go.

1503
01:13:09.863 --> 01:13:11.343
<i>Adios.</i> Decker.

1504
01:13:21.962 --> 01:13:22.963
Ruby.

1505
01:13:24.008 --> 01:13:25.836
Come here. You have to see this.

1506
01:13:31.929 --> 01:13:33.191
Daddy has a dog?

1507
01:13:33.713 --> 01:13:34.845
Michael.

1508
01:13:35.498 --> 01:13:36.499
what have you done?

1509
01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:41.721
<i>Well. it's all come down
to this final stage</i>

1510
01:13:41.721 --> 01:13:43.636
<i>of these world championships.</i>

1511
01:13:43.636 --> 01:13:45.812
<i>Team Arc'Teryx
and Team Broadrail.</i>

1512
01:13:45.812 --> 01:13:48.511
<i>plus their mascot.
are neck and neck.</i>

1513
01:13:48.511 --> 01:13:50.077
- All right. come on.

1514
01:13:50.077 --> 01:13:52.297
Hey. conserve your energy
until we get to the kayaks.

1515
01:13:52.297 --> 01:13:53.429
- all right. Chik?
-Yeah.

1516
01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:54.865
I got you. Michael.
We're good.

1517
01:13:54.865 --> 01:13:56.257
<i>There's gonna be
one final push</i>

1518
01:13:56.257 --> 01:13:57.868
<i>- to the finish line.</i>
-Come on. Chiki.

1519
01:13:57.868 --> 01:13:59.913
<i>Then we're gonna see
who can endure the most pain</i>

1520
01:13:59.913 --> 01:14:01.480
<i>and take the crown.</i>

1521
01:14:05.615 --> 01:14:07.268
All right.
Olivia and Chik in one.

1522
01:14:07.268 --> 01:14:08.661
Leo. me and you in the other.

1523
01:14:08.661 --> 01:14:10.010
We're gonna start off slow
and smooth.

1524
01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:11.534
- get a nice rhythm.
-Yes.

1525
01:14:11.534 --> 01:14:12.970
Once we get going.
we step on the gas.

1526
01:14:12.970 --> 01:14:15.102
and we don't let go. okay?

1527
01:14:15.102 --> 01:14:16.495
Hey. guys.
You know that you cannot

1528
01:14:16.495 --> 01:14:18.062
bring the dog. right?

1529
01:14:18.062 --> 01:14:19.629
Listen. we heard about the dog

1530
01:14:19.629 --> 01:14:21.413
and have decided
that it's not safe.

1531
01:14:21.413 --> 01:14:23.067
What do you mean? He's been
with us the whole time.

1532
01:14:23.067 --> 01:14:24.416
Listen to me. Okay?

1533
01:14:24.416 --> 01:14:26.592
Over 30 miles
of changing tides out there

1534
01:14:26.592 --> 01:14:29.247
in a boat that can barely fit
two people

1535
01:14:29.247 --> 01:14:31.249
is too much liability. okay?

1536
01:14:31.249 --> 01:14:32.598
Hey. Team Broadrail!

1537
01:14:32.598 --> 01:14:34.513
Chikerotis.
loser buys the beer. mate.

1538
01:14:39.562 --> 01:14:41.041
Hey. hey.

1539
01:14:41.041 --> 01:14:43.261
We can win this. All right?
Arc'Teryx is tired.

1540
01:14:44.741 --> 01:14:46.133
We've had four hours of rest
that they haven't.

1541
01:14:46.133 --> 01:14:48.092
We'll blow 'em away
in the water.

1542
01:14:48.092 --> 01:14:49.180
Remember why you came here.

1543
01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:50.529
- Yeah.
- Let's win this.

1544
01:14:53.793 --> 01:14:55.578
Yeah. he's a survivor. right?
He'll make it back.

1545
01:14:55.578 --> 01:14:57.275
- Oh. yeah.
-Come on!

1546
01:14:57.275 --> 01:14:58.406
He'll be all right.

1547
01:14:59.582 --> 01:15:01.105
Hey.

1548
01:15:01.105 --> 01:15:02.410
You'll be okay. You hear me?

1549
01:15:04.369 --> 01:15:05.762
You have wings. remember?

1550
01:15:09.026 --> 01:15:10.114
I don't have a choice.

1551
01:15:12.029 --> 01:15:13.247
You understand that. right?

1552
01:15:13.247 --> 01:15:14.945
This means too much
to too many people.

1553
01:15:14.945 --> 01:15:17.643
- Arthur. don't.

1554
01:15:17.643 --> 01:15:18.731
Please don't.

1555
01:15:19.297 --> 01:15:20.428
You'll be okay.

1556
01:15:21.517 --> 01:15:24.128
You'll be okay. You're Arthur.

1557
01:15:24.128 --> 01:15:26.565
You're the King.
You can run this place.

1558
01:15:26.565 --> 01:15:28.175
Michael!

1559
01:15:28.175 --> 01:15:30.395
- It's now or never!

1560
01:15:36.401 --> 01:15:38.229
- Let's go.
-Okay! Let's go!

1561
01:15:38.229 --> 01:15:39.839
Go. go! We'll catch up!

1562
01:17:43.441 --> 01:17:44.572
Leo. stop.

1563
01:17:46.531 --> 01:17:48.011
- Leo. stop!
- Michael!

1564
01:17:49.403 --> 01:17:50.491
Keep swimming. Arthur!

1565
01:17:50.491 --> 01:17:52.885
I'm coming!
Leo. we gotta get him.

1566
01:17:52.885 --> 01:17:55.279
Michael. we are so close!

1567
01:17:55.279 --> 01:17:56.454
He's one of us. all right?

1568
01:17:56.454 --> 01:17:57.411
I'm not gonna let him
drown out here.

1569
01:18:07.987 --> 01:18:09.380
One of us.

1570
01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:10.686
Keep swimming.
Arthur! We're gonna come!

1571
01:18:10.686 --> 01:18:11.948
Let's go get him!

1572
01:18:11.948 --> 01:18:13.166
- Arthur. keep swimming!

1573
01:18:13.166 --> 01:18:14.777
I'm coming! I'm coming!

1574
01:18:36.363 --> 01:18:37.756
Arthur. I'm coming!

1575
01:18:41.107 --> 01:18:43.457
Arthur!

1576
01:18:51.988 --> 01:18:54.642
- Come on! Come on! Come on!

1577
01:18:54.642 --> 01:18:56.906
Come on!

1578
01:18:56.906 --> 01:18:58.951
-Got him?
- There you go. Hey.

1579
01:18:59.952 --> 01:19:02.389
Yeah. There you go.

1580
01:19:02.389 --> 01:19:03.608
- I got you.

1581
01:19:03.608 --> 01:19:05.436
- We got you. okay?

1582
01:19:05.436 --> 01:19:07.438
Hey. I'm sorry. buddy. I had to.

1583
01:19:07.438 --> 01:19:08.961
No. don't be.

1584
01:19:10.876 --> 01:19:12.312
You don't know
when to quit. huh?

1585
01:19:13.618 --> 01:19:15.141
Michael. what happened?

1586
01:19:15.141 --> 01:19:18.188
Guys. I'm sorry. I had to.

1587
01:19:18.188 --> 01:19:20.494
It's okay. It's okay.

1588
01:19:22.105 --> 01:19:23.236
I don't know. We had 'em. Chiki.

1589
01:19:24.629 --> 01:19:25.804
Who the hell cares?

1590
01:19:25.804 --> 01:19:27.327
We should take care
of our own first.

1591
01:19:27.327 --> 01:19:29.634
I don't let
those guys win. not that easy.

1592
01:19:29.634 --> 01:19:31.897
Come on.
We can still make top five.

1593
01:19:31.897 --> 01:19:34.073
Are you gonna be able
to paddle with the dog?

1594
01:19:34.073 --> 01:19:35.683
Would be a lot easier
if he was a Chihuahua.

1595
01:19:35.683 --> 01:19:37.424
- All right. let's go.

1596
01:19:37.424 --> 01:19:39.470
Let's go.
Come on. Yeah.

1597
01:19:39.470 --> 01:19:42.125
Let's get 'em!

1598
01:19:42.125 --> 01:19:43.256
Come on.

1599
01:19:54.354 --> 01:19:56.226
Come here. boy.

1600
01:19:56.226 --> 01:19:57.749
- There you go.

1601
01:20:00.099 --> 01:20:02.493
How much longer. Chiki?

1602
01:20:02.493 --> 01:20:05.235
Four hours. if we're lucky
and the tide doesn't change!

1603
01:20:36.875 --> 01:20:39.617
Michael. how's he doing?

1604
01:20:39.617 --> 01:20:41.140
Not good. He's really quiet.

1605
01:21:04.990 --> 01:21:07.079
We can do it! Top three!

1606
01:21:07.079 --> 01:21:08.254
Top three. come on!

1607
01:21:09.690 --> 01:21:11.736
Michael. look. Finish line.

1608
01:21:18.699 --> 01:21:20.963
<i>Here comes
Team Arc'Teryx to the finish.</i>

1609
01:21:20.963 --> 01:21:23.139
<i>A truly valiant effort.</i>

1610
01:21:23.139 --> 01:21:24.836
<i>You'd have to think
that this would be</i>

1611
01:21:24.836 --> 01:21:27.056
<i>a Michael Light
and Team Broadrail here</i>

1612
01:21:27.056 --> 01:21:28.971
<i>had they not gone out
of their way</i>

1613
01:21:28.971 --> 01:21:30.929
<i>to save their furry companion.</i>

1614
01:21:30.929 --> 01:21:32.539
<i>- What a sacrifice.</i>

1615
01:21:32.539 --> 01:21:34.498
We made it. buddy.

1616
01:21:34.498 --> 01:21:36.152
We're gonna make it. Arthur.
Come on.

1617
01:21:37.588 --> 01:21:40.243
- Come on. Push.

1618
01:21:52.429 --> 01:21:53.604
What's he doing?

1619
01:21:53.604 --> 01:21:55.301
Ah. he's wiggling around
a little bit.

1620
01:21:55.301 --> 01:21:56.999
Think he might wanna
try to get down and walk.

1621
01:21:56.999 --> 01:21:58.261
Yeah. let's try to see
if he can walk.

1622
01:21:58.261 --> 01:21:59.610
- Yeah. yeah.
- Just for a minute.

1623
01:21:59.610 --> 01:22:00.741
- All right. Easy. boy.

1624
01:22:00.741 --> 01:22:01.873
Easy.

1625
01:22:01.873 --> 01:22:03.005
There you go.
Yeah.

1626
01:22:03.005 --> 01:22:04.136
There you go.

1627
01:22:04.136 --> 01:22:06.530
If he can run.
so can we. yeah?

1628
01:22:06.530 --> 01:22:08.488
Guess he wants
to finish strong. huh?

1629
01:22:08.488 --> 01:22:10.186
Come on.

1630
01:22:35.907 --> 01:22:37.996
We did it!

1631
01:22:41.869 --> 01:22:43.045
You're amazing.

1632
01:22:44.002 --> 01:22:45.961
We did it! We did it.

1633
01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:47.614
Come here. Come here.

1634
01:22:47.614 --> 01:22:50.095
Oh. my God!
I will never forget this day.

1635
01:22:50.095 --> 01:22:51.401
You okay? You okay?

1636
01:22:51.401 --> 01:22:53.577
How you doing?
Pretty good. Yeah.

1637
01:22:53.577 --> 01:22:55.579
I can't wait to tell my dad
about this.

1638
01:22:58.495 --> 01:22:59.757
- Oh. man.
- Chiki.

1639
01:22:59.757 --> 01:23:01.324
- I love you. buddy.
- Yeah. I love you too.

1640
01:23:04.283 --> 01:23:05.676
Hey. I don't know
about you guys.

1641
01:23:05.676 --> 01:23:07.808
- Come here. Come here. boy.
- I feel like we won.

1642
01:23:07.808 --> 01:23:09.288
Oh. yeah.

1643
01:23:09.288 --> 01:23:11.943
- Sweetest victory ever.
-Hey. come here.

1644
01:23:14.685 --> 01:23:17.644
Hey. Michael. One for us. huh?

1645
01:23:17.644 --> 01:23:18.819
Hey.
What?

1646
01:23:18.819 --> 01:23:20.430
Where the hell did you get that?

1647
01:23:20.430 --> 01:23:21.692
Oh. come on. Michael.
You know I always got a spare.

1648
01:23:21.692 --> 01:23:23.563
- You gotta be shitting me.

1649
01:23:23.563 --> 01:23:24.782
Come on. let's take a picture.

1650
01:23:28.873 --> 01:23:30.744
Hey. that's dope.

1651
01:23:30.744 --> 01:23:32.616
Oh. look at that.
He's smiling for once!

1652
01:23:33.921 --> 01:23:35.227
Hey. this one's gonna get more

1653
01:23:35.227 --> 01:23:36.533
- than the mud post for sure.

1654
01:23:36.533 --> 01:23:37.577
Yeah.

1655
01:23:40.537 --> 01:23:42.060
Good boy.

1656
01:23:44.323 --> 01:23:45.455
You're okay.

1657
01:23:45.977 --> 01:23:47.022
You're okay.

1658
01:23:47.979 --> 01:23:48.980
Yeah.

1659
01:24:02.515 --> 01:24:04.822
Hey. Whoa. whoa.
What's the matter?

1660
01:24:04.822 --> 01:24:07.172
- Arthur. you okay?

1661
01:24:08.434 --> 01:24:09.740
Arthur?

1662
01:24:22.144 --> 01:24:23.493
What's he saying?

1663
01:24:31.066 --> 01:24:32.197
What is it?

1664
01:24:32.197 --> 01:24:34.852
He has major wounds from abuse.

1665
01:24:34.852 --> 01:24:37.550
And the wounds are not
just infected. but infested.

1666
01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:39.509
See that shell?

1667
01:24:39.509 --> 01:24:41.424
That's a parasite
that's eating at his flesh.

1668
01:24:41.424 --> 01:24:44.775
and what's underneath.
it's even more serious.

1669
01:24:46.516 --> 01:24:48.126
His teeth are rotted.

1670
01:24:48.126 --> 01:24:49.910
and we're sure that
every bite that he takes

1671
01:24:50.868 --> 01:24:52.261
is very. very painful for him.

1672
01:24:57.483 --> 01:24:59.442
Um...

1673
01:24:59.442 --> 01:25:01.096
We'll sedate him
to clean the wounds.

1674
01:25:02.445 --> 01:25:04.055
But at this point.
it's really about

1675
01:25:04.055 --> 01:25:05.883
making him feel comfortable.

1676
01:25:05.883 --> 01:25:08.059
Comfortable? For what?

1677
01:25:08.059 --> 01:25:10.061
If he's lucky.
he'll live a few days.

1678
01:25:10.975 --> 01:25:12.455
That infestation
is too vigorous.

1679
01:25:12.455 --> 01:25:13.717
and we really can't do

1680
01:25:13.717 --> 01:25:15.153
the kind of surgery
that he needs.

1681
01:25:18.852 --> 01:25:21.028
Well. what about in the U.S.?
I'm taking him home.

1682
01:25:21.028 --> 01:25:23.857
I really don't think
that he'll make it.

1683
01:25:23.857 --> 01:25:26.469
Plus. you'll never
get permission to take him.

1684
01:25:26.469 --> 01:25:27.992
Why would I need permission?

1685
01:25:27.992 --> 01:25:29.646
It's my dog.
I'm taking him home.

1686
01:25:29.646 --> 01:25:31.256
I understand.

1687
01:25:31.256 --> 01:25:34.041
But the agricultural board
at the airport

1688
01:25:34.041 --> 01:25:36.131
- will never let him out.

1689
01:25:40.787 --> 01:25:41.788
Um...

1690
01:25:43.094 --> 01:25:44.748
Michael. he...

1691
01:25:44.748 --> 01:25:47.272
he should die with dignity.

1692
01:25:47.272 --> 01:25:49.535
and we can give him that here.

1693
01:25:51.189 --> 01:25:53.191
I need to call my wife.

1694
01:25:53.191 --> 01:25:55.019
Buddy.

1695
01:25:55.019 --> 01:25:58.022
I'll be right there. okay?
I'm not going anywhere.

1696
01:25:58.022 --> 01:25:59.371
I'm just gonna call home. okay?

1697
01:26:00.503 --> 01:26:01.634
I'll call home.
I'll be right back.

1698
01:26:10.991 --> 01:26:12.384
- Hey.
-<i>Helen.</i>

1699
01:26:12.384 --> 01:26:14.430
<i>How's he doing?</i>
Well. it's bad.

1700
01:26:16.475 --> 01:26:18.042
The vet says there's
nothing they can do for him.

1701
01:26:18.042 --> 01:26:19.870
They wanna put him down.

1702
01:26:19.870 --> 01:26:21.480
<i>Oh. Michael.</i>

1703
01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:24.091
Plus. I have
to get the local government

1704
01:26:24.091 --> 01:26:26.616
to give him permission
or something to take him out.

1705
01:26:26.616 --> 01:26:28.357
I don't know.

1706
01:26:28.357 --> 01:26:30.097
<i>He's been through so much.</i>

1707
01:26:32.622 --> 01:26:34.841
I really wish you and Ruby
got to meet him.

1708
01:26:37.279 --> 01:26:38.410
He's different. Helen.

1709
01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:42.197
He's a sufferer. He's a fighter.

1710
01:26:42.893 --> 01:26:44.286
Just like you.

1711
01:26:48.028 --> 01:26:51.075
If you could ask him.
what would he say?

1712
01:26:52.424 --> 01:26:54.252
<i>I don't think
he has any fight left.</i>

1713
01:26:57.081 --> 01:26:58.213
I'll call you back.

1714
01:26:58.778 --> 01:26:59.910
I love you.

1715
01:27:02.565 --> 01:27:03.957
Doctor says it's time.

1716
01:27:03.957 --> 01:27:06.264
so we'll give you
a few minutes to say goodbye.

1717
01:27:16.231 --> 01:27:18.407
-Arthur...

1718
01:27:19.582 --> 01:27:21.323
I don't want you
to hurt anymore. buddy.

1719
01:27:24.848 --> 01:27:26.371
You've been through so much.

1720
01:27:30.462 --> 01:27:31.724
And you've done more for me

1721
01:27:31.724 --> 01:27:33.030
than you'll ever know.

1722
01:27:36.163 --> 01:27:38.253
Now you go out
like a king. okay?

1723
01:27:39.079 --> 01:27:40.211
It's okay.

1724
01:27:41.517 --> 01:27:44.563
Arthur. you gotta tell me.

1725
01:27:44.563 --> 01:27:46.173
Do you want me to let you go?

1726
01:27:56.575 --> 01:27:58.708
I'm gonna fight too. okay?

1727
01:27:58.708 --> 01:28:00.362
We're gonna fight together.

1728
01:28:00.362 --> 01:28:02.364
I'm gonna get you home. okay?

1729
01:28:02.364 --> 01:28:04.061
Let's go home.

1730
01:28:04.061 --> 01:28:06.368
I need to get him
out of here now.

1731
01:28:06.368 --> 01:28:07.717
I'm gonna get you home. okay?

1732
01:28:14.289 --> 01:28:16.073
Watch your step. buddy.

1733
01:28:18.684 --> 01:28:21.208
Hey. it's okay. buddy.
What's the matter?

1734
01:28:21.208 --> 01:28:23.950
Hey. It's okay.

1735
01:28:23.950 --> 01:28:26.170
We're just gonna go get
a little sleep for tomorrow.

1736
01:28:26.170 --> 01:28:27.389
All right? We both need it.

1737
01:28:27.867 --> 01:28:30.305
Come on. It's okay.

1738
01:28:30.305 --> 01:28:31.741
- What?

1739
01:28:32.263 --> 01:28:33.308
Hey.

1740
01:28:34.613 --> 01:28:36.354
- What is it?

1741
01:28:36.354 --> 01:28:38.356
- Are you scared to go inside?

1742
01:28:40.445 --> 01:28:42.317
It's safe. and warm. and nice.

1743
01:28:42.317 --> 01:28:44.188
- I promise.

1744
01:28:45.885 --> 01:28:47.191
Oh. my gosh.

1745
01:28:47.191 --> 01:28:48.801
All right. Where do
you wanna go to sleep?

1746
01:28:49.628 --> 01:28:51.369
Huh? Come on.

1747
01:28:52.805 --> 01:28:54.807
We'll find somewhere to
lay down for a little while.

1748
01:28:56.243 --> 01:28:57.897
You don't know
what you're missin'. buddy.

1749
01:29:03.816 --> 01:29:05.296
We're gonna have
to stay somewhere.

1750
01:29:06.906 --> 01:29:08.908
Where do you wanna go? Huh?

1751
01:29:12.434 --> 01:29:14.784
Oh. God. Finally.

1752
01:29:14.784 --> 01:29:17.352
All right. Come on.

1753
01:29:27.536 --> 01:29:29.842
Cashed in my entire savings
for that hotel room.

1754
01:29:32.976 --> 01:29:34.412
I'm not a dog person.

1755
01:29:35.587 --> 01:29:36.980
I never even had a pet.

1756
01:29:42.159 --> 01:29:43.247
Yeah.

1757
01:29:53.649 --> 01:29:55.607
-Hey. Michael.

1758
01:29:55.607 --> 01:29:57.479
Michael. hey!

1759
01:29:57.479 --> 01:29:58.741
I've been lookin'
all over for you. man.

1760
01:29:58.741 --> 01:30:01.221
- We've got a plane to catch.

1761
01:30:01.221 --> 01:30:03.006
I can't believe
you slept out here.

1762
01:30:03.006 --> 01:30:05.008
I wouldn't call it "sleeping."

1763
01:30:05.008 --> 01:30:06.183
Well. you can sleep
on the plane.

1764
01:30:06.183 --> 01:30:07.489
Come on. we gotta go.

1765
01:30:07.489 --> 01:30:09.360
Are you okay. boy?
All right. It's okay.

1766
01:30:11.928 --> 01:30:13.146
You all right?

1767
01:30:13.146 --> 01:30:15.758
Well. I've been better.

1768
01:30:15.758 --> 01:30:16.889
How is he?

1769
01:30:16.889 --> 01:30:18.108
Not good.

1770
01:30:24.984 --> 01:30:27.204
It's okay. Come on. Come on.

1771
01:30:36.648 --> 01:30:37.997
We support you. Michael!

1772
01:30:41.566 --> 01:30:42.785
You guys did this?

1773
01:30:42.785 --> 01:30:44.090
We all did this.

1774
01:30:44.090 --> 01:30:45.918
-Thank you.

1775
01:30:45.918 --> 01:30:47.790
-Good on you. Michael.
- Thank you. guys.

1776
01:30:50.140 --> 01:30:51.358
Michael. go.

1777
01:31:11.117 --> 01:31:12.902
Thanks for calling us.

1778
01:31:12.902 --> 01:31:14.164
We were excited to help out.

1779
01:31:15.557 --> 01:31:17.559
So you got the press with you?

1780
01:31:17.559 --> 01:31:20.910
Well. yeah. We won. right?
Everyone loves a winner.

1781
01:31:20.910 --> 01:31:23.303
- My God. You never change.

1782
01:31:25.871 --> 01:31:27.090
Can I ask you something?

1783
01:31:27.090 --> 01:31:28.526
I know what you're gonna ask me.

1784
01:31:30.528 --> 01:31:31.921
And the answer is no.

1785
01:31:31.921 --> 01:31:33.270
There's no way
we would've beat you

1786
01:31:33.270 --> 01:31:34.401
on that paddle.

1787
01:31:35.794 --> 01:31:37.274
I mean. that race
was yours to win.

1788
01:31:38.884 --> 01:31:40.277
Congratulations. old friend.

1789
01:31:43.933 --> 01:31:45.064
For what it's worth.

1790
01:31:46.457 --> 01:31:48.285
I'd share a pack
with you any day. Chik.

1791
01:31:55.553 --> 01:31:58.469
Let's get him out of here.
and have that beer.

1792
01:32:04.170 --> 01:32:05.171
-Hey!

1793
01:32:05.171 --> 01:32:06.521
Smile! You're live.

1794
01:32:22.319 --> 01:32:25.235
Comin' home. baby!
There we go.

1795
01:32:25.235 --> 01:32:26.628
Signing off right now.

1796
01:32:28.194 --> 01:32:29.456
Keep in touch.

1797
01:32:29.456 --> 01:32:31.154
Make sure you like
and subscribe.

1798
01:32:31.154 --> 01:32:32.198
Whoo!

1799
01:32:41.381 --> 01:32:42.731
Oh. What is... What is that?

1800
01:32:44.167 --> 01:32:45.603
I can't put him in that.

1801
01:32:45.603 --> 01:32:47.518
You think he's gonna sit up
in first class?

1802
01:32:47.518 --> 01:32:49.085
In the cage. or he doesn't fly.

1803
01:32:49.085 --> 01:32:50.173
No. no. no.
You don't understand.

1804
01:32:50.173 --> 01:32:52.523
He... He can't go
into that cage.

1805
01:32:52.523 --> 01:32:53.916
He wouldn't even come
into my hotel room.

1806
01:32:53.916 --> 01:32:55.744
He was terrified
to come into the airport.

1807
01:32:55.744 --> 01:32:58.094
This dog... It's not
that kinda dog. okay?

1808
01:32:58.094 --> 01:32:59.182
I can't put him in that cage.

1809
01:32:59.182 --> 01:33:00.357
I'm not gonna let him die alone.

1810
01:33:00.357 --> 01:33:01.488
He's gonna die
in that fucking cage!

1811
01:33:01.488 --> 01:33:02.664
I'm not gonna put him in there.

1812
01:33:02.664 --> 01:33:03.926
The dog either
gets inside the cage.

1813
01:33:03.926 --> 01:33:05.057
or he's not getting
on the plane.

1814
01:33:05.057 --> 01:33:06.189
No. please.

1815
01:33:06.189 --> 01:33:07.930
He's not well. All right?

1816
01:33:07.930 --> 01:33:10.062
Six hours in the bottom
of a plane is gonna kill him.

1817
01:33:10.062 --> 01:33:12.587
- I'm just doing my job. sir.

1818
01:33:18.244 --> 01:33:20.551
Come here. buddy.

1819
01:33:20.551 --> 01:33:22.640
Come here. Come here.
Look at me. buddy.

1820
01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:24.337
I need you to be okay.

1821
01:33:24.337 --> 01:33:26.122
- All right? I need...

1822
01:33:26.688 --> 01:33:27.863
Please.

1823
01:33:27.863 --> 01:33:28.994
I need you to be okay.

1824
01:33:28.994 --> 01:33:30.648
Please.

1825
01:33:30.648 --> 01:33:32.084
I'm gonna be there.
waiting for you

1826
01:33:32.084 --> 01:33:34.609
the second you get off. okay?

1827
01:33:34.609 --> 01:33:36.132
I'm gonna be there.

1828
01:33:36.132 --> 01:33:37.873
You're gonna be okay. Okay?

1829
01:33:39.396 --> 01:33:41.398
- Okay.

1830
01:33:41.398 --> 01:33:43.095
All right. come on.

1831
01:33:43.095 --> 01:33:44.880
Come on. boy.
It's okay. Go ahead.

1832
01:33:48.318 --> 01:33:49.885
- Arthur.

1833
01:33:49.885 --> 01:33:51.756
Arthur.

1834
01:33:51.756 --> 01:33:53.366
I promise you
I'll be there. okay?

1835
01:33:53.366 --> 01:33:55.455
You be strong
for me one more time.

1836
01:33:56.587 --> 01:33:58.110
I'm gonna be there.

1837
01:33:58.110 --> 01:33:59.764
- Okay?

1838
01:33:59.764 --> 01:34:00.983
Be careful with him. please.

1839
01:34:14.257 --> 01:34:15.301
Excuse me.

1840
01:34:17.303 --> 01:34:18.348
Excuse me.

1841
01:34:18.348 --> 01:34:19.479
Sorry.

1842
01:34:22.134 --> 01:34:23.483
In here somewhere.

1843
01:34:25.921 --> 01:34:27.662
He hasn't moved
since he got here.

1844
01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:31.622
- Hey.

1845
01:34:31.622 --> 01:34:33.537
Well. I'm here. buddy.
It's okay.

1846
01:34:33.537 --> 01:34:34.973
- I'm here.

1847
01:34:34.973 --> 01:34:36.453
I'm gonna get you out of there.

1848
01:34:36.453 --> 01:34:38.629
I'm gonna get you
out of there. okay?

1849
01:34:38.629 --> 01:34:40.239
All right. come on.
I'm gonna get you out.

1850
01:34:40.805 --> 01:34:42.502
Come here.

1851
01:34:42.502 --> 01:34:44.287
I've never seen
anything like this.

1852
01:34:44.287 --> 01:34:45.331
Here they come.

1853
01:34:48.813 --> 01:34:49.988
-There he is!

1854
01:34:49.988 --> 01:34:51.903
-Michael.
- There's Daddy.

1855
01:34:51.903 --> 01:34:53.862
Hey. Michael!
Arthur gonna be okay?

1856
01:34:53.862 --> 01:34:55.472
There he is.

1857
01:34:55.472 --> 01:34:57.430
Listen. this is Susan.
the vet from the clinic.

1858
01:34:57.430 --> 01:34:59.215
Is he gonna be okay?
Yeah. yeah.

1859
01:34:59.215 --> 01:35:00.520
Of course. honey.

1860
01:35:12.576 --> 01:35:13.795
Come on.

1861
01:35:24.457 --> 01:35:26.068
Everybody knows
about him.

1862
01:35:26.068 --> 01:35:27.547
-Mm-hmm.
- It's crazy.

1863
01:35:29.158 --> 01:35:31.551
You know people have been
sending in money to help?

1864
01:35:31.551 --> 01:35:32.639
- Really?
- Yeah.

1865
01:35:32.639 --> 01:35:34.424
Thousands of dollars so far.

1866
01:35:34.424 --> 01:35:35.773
Oh. my God.

1867
01:35:35.773 --> 01:35:36.905
We're gonna need it.

1868
01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:40.778
We have another mouth to feed.

1869
01:35:40.778 --> 01:35:42.693
A couple of meatballs.
he's fine.

1870
01:35:44.564 --> 01:35:46.001
Not that kind of mouth.

1871
01:35:49.308 --> 01:35:50.353
What... Are you?

1872
01:35:50.353 --> 01:35:51.920
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

1873
01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:53.660
Yeah. I found out
a couple days ago.

1874
01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:55.401
Why didn't you tell me?

1875
01:35:55.401 --> 01:35:57.012
- I was saving it.
- For what?

1876
01:35:57.012 --> 01:35:59.231
In case you needed
some good news.

1877
01:36:01.146 --> 01:36:02.974
- You know you're gonna be...

1878
01:36:02.974 --> 01:36:04.715
Michael.
What? What is it?

1879
01:36:04.715 --> 01:36:06.804
- We need your help.
- What?

1880
01:36:14.681 --> 01:36:16.422
We're not sure
if he's going to make it.

1881
01:36:17.772 --> 01:36:20.383
- Can I touch him?
- Yes. Gently.

1882
01:36:20.383 --> 01:36:22.472
Hey. Hey.

1883
01:36:23.125 --> 01:36:24.213
Arthur.

1884
01:36:27.390 --> 01:36:28.913
Arthur.

1885
01:36:28.913 --> 01:36:31.089
- I'm here. buddy. I'm here.

1886
01:36:31.916 --> 01:36:33.048
It's okay.

1887
01:36:34.049 --> 01:36:35.006
Hey.

1888
01:36:35.528 --> 01:36:36.965
Hi.

1889
01:36:36.965 --> 01:36:39.837
- Yeah. Yeah.

1890
01:36:39.837 --> 01:36:41.317
We're here together.

1891
01:36:42.013 --> 01:36:43.710
Hey.

1892
01:36:43.710 --> 01:36:45.712
You're gonna have
another brother or sister.

1893
01:36:46.670 --> 01:36:47.671
Yeah.

1894
01:36:48.150 --> 01:36:50.413
Yeah.
