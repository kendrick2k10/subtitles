00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
-

4
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I'll reconfirm the time.
and the location.

5
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Wait for my call.

6
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Yes. wear the blue tie.

7
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
-

8
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Hello?

9
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Mona Juul
He'll be there at noon.

10
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Excellent. darling.

11
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Mona:
Listen to me.

12
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
This meeting is
completely unofficial.

13
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Understood. Absolutely.

14
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
You cannot even
mention my ministry.

15
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Darling... Darling...
Trust me.

16
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Two years of multi-national
negotiations

17
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
between us and the Palestinians
have achieved

18
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
absolutely nothing.

19
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Why? Because our government

20
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
refuses to negotiate
directly with the PLO.

21
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
They are not allowed
at the table.

22
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
But every day.
Ahmed Qurie.

23
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
the PLO's finance minister.
in London.

24
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
sitting in a hotel room
across the street

25
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
telling the Palestinian
delegation exactly what to say.

26
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
We are racing
toward a precipice.

27
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
In Europe.
they are calling us Nazis.

28
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
In Europe.

29
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Every day. more and more
of the world turns against us.

30
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
but all we do is sit at that
fucking negotiation table.

31
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Terje Larsen:
Because you're trapped

32
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
incapable of building trust.

33
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
But...

34
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
with my assistance.
my expertise.

35
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
you could change that.

36
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Tell me exactly what part
of the Norwegian government

37
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
-are you with. Mr. Huntsen?
-Larsen.

38
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Call me Terje.

39
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
No. I'm a. a private citizen.

40
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
I run the Fafo Institute.

41
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
A think tank.

42
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
-Why would I accept your help?
-Because you need it.

43
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Because my negotiating model.
and mine alone.

44
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
is going to help you.

45
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
You and the Palestinians
are using

46
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
the antiquated negotiating
model of totalism.

47
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
All issues of disagreement

48
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
on the table.
All sides at the table.

49
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
It's disastrous.
The process is formal.

50
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
and the results
are absolute failure.

51
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
But this is what
the Americans want us to do.

52
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And so you must do it.
but at the same time.

53
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
start a second process.

54
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Built. not on grand
pronouncements between

55
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
but intimate discussions
between people

56
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
held somewhere isolated.

57
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Totally.

58
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Where you
and the PLO can meet.

59
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And talk.

60
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
This process I could oversee.

61
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
The place. I'd arrange.

62
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Absolute discretion.
guaranteed.

63
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
It is illegal for
any Israeli official

64
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
-Yes.
-But someone unofficial...

65
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
-Who you and Peres could choose.
-That you could introduce to.

66
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
-Exactly what I was thinking.
-Yes.

67
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
-Tea?
-Yes.

68
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Ahmed Qurie:
And how long were you

69
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Mona:
Two years.

70
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And from this.
you have just returned.

71
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Yes.

72
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Thank you.

73
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
It is a pleasure to meet you.
Mr. Qurie.

74
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
I'm pleased our work
brings us to London

75
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Ah. well. you are here for work.

76
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
But alas. I am here
for foolishness.

77
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
In that hotel.

78
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
they are negotiating
for the future of Palestine.

79
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Yet I. who am the finance
minister of the PLO.

80
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
I am banned. barred.

81
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
blocked from the very table

82
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
where the economic
future of my people

83
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
is to be determined.

84
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Mr. Qurie. you don't need
to give me the speech.

85
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Of course.

86
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
You are on our side.

87
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And on theirs.

88
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Forgive me. but
I don't speak Arabic.

89
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And yet you profess
to understand my region

90
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
and my people.

91
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
when in fact. clearly.

92
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
there is very little
that you understand.

93
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Mona:
That may be true.

94
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
But I do understand that
your Chairman Arafat's

95
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
backing of Saddam Hussein
in the Gulf War

96
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
so angered your
now former Arab allies

97
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
that they expelled 90.000
Palestinian guest workers.

98
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
thereby creating such
a financial catastrophe

99
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
for your people.

100
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
that the PLO is now stuck
in exile in Tunis.

101
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
unable to pay even
the electricity bills.

102
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
I also understand

103
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
that without additional support
from my government.

104
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
your organization will slide

105
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
one step closer to irrelevancy.

106
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Mr. Qurie.

107
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
tell me how much you need.

108
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
and I will do what I can.

109
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
But I want you to do one thing.

110
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Not for me. For you.

111
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
There's a man being sent here
to London to meet you today.

112
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
If you are willing to see him.

113
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
-This way. Yep. Mm-hmm.
-I'm not here as my government.

114
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
-He knows this. right?
-Yes. he knows. He knows.

115
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
It is against the law.
Mr. Larsen.

116
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
-for any Israeli--
-Both: To meet with the PLO.

117
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
I know. Shh. shh. shh.
After you. After you.

118
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
-Yes. he knows. Come on.

119
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
-Absolutely. Absolutely.
-But. I. I. I--

120
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000
What's wrong?

121
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
I have never met
an Israeli face-to-face.

122
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
-

123
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Now. you know what
you're going to say?

124
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
-Ah. yes. yes.
Yes. of course.

125
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Yeah. yeah. Right. Okay.

126
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
-Right. Here we go.
-

127
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Oh.

128
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Hello.

129
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Hello.

130
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
London is very cold
this time of year.

131
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Yes.

132
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And wet.

133
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Yes.

134
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Not like home.

135
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
I have not been home
since 1967.

136
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
when every man. woman.
and child in my village

137
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
was forced to flee our homeland.

138
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
before the advancing
hordes of Zionism.

139
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Aah.

140
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
But I remember well
the warmth there

141
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
this time of year.

142
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
I read your latest paper.

143
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Oh?

144
00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
I thought it was excellent.

145
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Thank you.

146
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
As a matter of fact. I...

147
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
I've written a paper of my own.

148
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
demonstrating the benefits
of such economic cooperation.

149
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Perhaps if you could read it.

150
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Give me your
professional feedback.

151
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
I would be honored.

152
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Mona:
Gentlemen. it's time.

153
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
-You have been most generous

154
00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000
We should meet again.

155
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
To discuss economics.

156
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000
The future.

157
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
I'm told if we were
to meet in Oslo.

158
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Friends would prove--
appro--

159
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Sorry... Sorry.

160
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
I am told if we were
to meet in Oslo.

161
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
friends would provide us

162
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
solitude and privacy.

163
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
and anything else
we would require.

164
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Who are you?

165
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
I'm just a professor
of economics

166
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
who supports dialogue
with the PLO.

167
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
On whose authority do you speak?

168
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
I have no authority!

169
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
But I am having breakfast
tomorrow in Tel Aviv

170
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
with my dear good friend
Yossi Beilin.

171
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
I am so looking forward

172
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
to telling our new
deputy foreign minister

173
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
about my trip to London.

174
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
-Jan Egeland: My God.

175
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
I mean. my God.
that's impossible.

176
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Larsen:
Jan. the Berlin Wall

177
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
the Soviet empire has disbanded.
Anything is possible.

178
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
If we set up a meeting
here in Norway.

179
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Ahmed Qurie will come
as the voice of the PLO.

180
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
There is no voice of the PLO
but Arafat's. Mona.

181
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Who is this Ahmed Qurie?

182
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
How can you be sure
this man has even told Arafat

183
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Because Arafat is fully
informed and behind this.

184
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
-Really?
-Yes. Absolutely.

185
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
And if we host it.
the Israelis are on board.

186
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
No. Mona.

187
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Yossi Beilin is on board.
who does not have the authority

188
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
-to authorize such a thing.
-Larsen: Jan. Jan. Jan. Jan.

189
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Yossi told me to my face.
Directly.

190
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
This comes from Shimon Peres.
No question.

191
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Mona. you are I are members
of the foreign service.

192
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
We cannot jeopardize
the Norwegian government's

193
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
We're not talking
about involving

194
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
-This is just us. It's just us.
-Do you not see

195
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
in what you are proposing here?

196
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
You're a junior minister.
and Terje's just a sociologist.

197
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Then that must be enough.

198
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Listen. we will say that
Terje's institute is hosting

199
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
a conference here in Norway

200
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
for Israeli and Palestinian
academics.

201
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Terje will ask a friend
to loan us his manor house.

202
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
I will book them all
on regular flights

203
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Rental cars only.
and no diplomatic channels.

204
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
But for this to work.
we need you

205
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
to sign off on their visas.

206
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Jan. Jan. listen.

207
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
No one else in the government
needs to know.

208
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
This way. Holst
and the ministry

209
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
If you say no.
this conversation

210
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
-Isn't that right. Terje?
-Of course.

211
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Let's fucking do it.

212
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
-Yes?
-But officially.

213
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
-If this goes to shit.
it's all on you.

214
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
-And don't tell the Americans.
-What are you talking about?

215
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
What are we going to tell them?
"Hello. Nothing has happened.

216
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000
and we. we just
wanted you to know."

217
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Do you know what
their government

218
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
if we're caught meddling
in the Middle East?

219
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Mona. how are we going
to keep things hidden

220
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000
if the Americans are involved?

221
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Okay. this is a diplomatic
issue. darling.

222
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
-which is none of your concern.
-I agree with Terje.

223
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
If we are going to take a risk.

224
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
let's take a risk.

225
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Okay.

226
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000
So...

227
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Here we go.

228
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
-

229
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Mona:
Terje. if this fails...

230
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
-If this goes wrong--
-Darling. we have a plan now.

231
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
and if it goes wrong.
then we'll improvise.

232
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Our lives will be ruined.

233
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Do you understand?

234
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Yes. I do.

235
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
But we have a chance now.

236
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
A real chance to
make a difference.

237
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Whatever happens between them.

238
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
we will not interfere.

239
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
If we are seen
by anyone as favoring

240
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
-one side over the oth--
-Darling. I would never

241
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Then say it.

242
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
We will facilitate.

243
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
and facilitate only.
Say it.

244
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
-We will facilitate.

245
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Only.

246
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
We will facilitate.
and facilitate...

247
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
only.

248
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Thank you.

249
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Your bastards of

250
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
"Stand in that line
and shut your mouth.

251
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
and do as you are told."

252
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Like I am some
underwear merchant!

253
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Uh. sorry. I'm sorry.
Everything's fine.

254
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000
It's all right.
Everything's fine.

255
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
little mix-up.
I'm so sorry.

256
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
wasn't part of the. the plan.

257
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000
You should have been
sent straight through.

258
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
no. no questions asked.

259
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Hello. Let me. let me.
let me. let me take your bag.

260
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Good.

261
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
All right?

262
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Good trip?

263
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Ow.

264
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
There is no motorcade?

265
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
No. Just me.

266
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Mr. Larsen. we have flown
across the world

267
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
in the seating of the coach.

268
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
I know. gentlemen.
but this is the best way.

269
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Trust me.

270
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
All right.

271
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Ooh! Sorry.

272
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Okay.

273
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Right. Let's go.

274
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000
From the Palestinian
Liberation Organization.

275
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
Mr. Ahmed Qurie.
and his associate.

276
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
Mr. Hassan Asfour.

277
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
And from the
University of Haifa.

278
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Professor Yair Hirschfeld.
and his associate.

279
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Professor Ron Pundak.

280
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Hello. And. hello.

281
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
This regal and historic
guest house

282
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
is built on the very site
where 800 years ago.

283
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000
St. Olaf himself erected
his castle. stone by stone.

284
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000
as he strove to make
Norway a nation.

285
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000
And your Olaf was killed.

286
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
and his castle destroyed
in a landslide.

287
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
Yes. thank you.
Thank you.

288
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000
Much appreciated.

289
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
I don't know about
the rest of you. but...

290
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
my God. I find it cold here.

291
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
Not as cold as the hearts
of your jack-booted

292
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000
as they break the bones
of the sons and daughters

293
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Again. thank you.

294
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
Much appreciated.

295
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000
Gentlemen. you are here
because you know

296
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000
that you and your people
cannot go on as you have.

297
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
That whatever you
personally feel.

298
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000
you want to find
the way forward.

299
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
So. tell me. Abu Ala--

300
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Ahmed Qurie.

301
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
I am Ahmed Qurie!

302
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
-But your friends
call you Abu Ala. yes?

303
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
While here. here.
we are all friends.

304
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
And while we are here together.

305
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000
that must be our one
unbreakable rule.

306
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Now please. follow me.

307
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000
In that room.
when the door is closed.

308
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000
you four will talk.

309
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
you'll disagree. worse.

310
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000
But out here.
we'll share our meals.

311
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
We'll talk of our families.
We'll light the fire.

312
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000
Because it's only in
the sharing of the personal

313
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
that we can see each other
for who we truly are.

314
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000
I. uh... we...

315
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000
accept your rule. and. uh.

316
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
we are willing to try.

317
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Between our peoples
lies a vast ocean.

318
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Those who have tried
to cross before us

319
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000
have turned back. or drowned.

320
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Let us be the first

321
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
to step upon the other's shore.

322
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
Good.

323
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
Good luck.

324
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
You mean... it is to be just us?

325
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Out here. I will do
all that you ask.

326
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000
but in there. I cannot help you.

327
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Only you. together.
can do this.

328
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000
So what do you think?

329
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000
I think if Hassan Asfour
doesn't kill us in our sleep.

330
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
it will be a miracle.

331
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000
No. no. no. no.
They must be

332
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Good. Did you get
what I asked for?

333
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
The Johnny Walker Black.
Ja.

334
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
-How many bottles?
-Four.

335
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000
We'll need four cases.

336
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000
-Terje. no!
-What about dinner?

337
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000
-I will serve herring to start.
-Larsen: Herring. Good.

338
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000
-A small pasta course.
-Larsen: Excellent.

339
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
And roasted pork

340
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
-stuffed with sage--
-Oh. no! No. no. no.

341
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000
No. Out of the question.

342
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
-I've already
prepared the dish--

343
00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
Fish. yes? Salmon.
Salmon. yes?

344
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000
-Good. Just do it.
-Mr. Larsen--

345
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Yes?

346
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Okay.
-Thank you. Thank you.

347
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000
I must speak with
the chairman in Tunis.

348
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Follow me. sir.
If you would.

349
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000
They say they will take Gaza.

350
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000
They propose Israel withdraw
all forces from Gaza.

351
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
That the territory
will be turned over

352
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
who will govern it themselves.

353
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000
My God.

354
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
To be able to pull out of Gaza.

355
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
that would end the Intifada!

356
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000
They. they. they want
to go even further!

357
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000
They've brought an outline
for a declaration of principles

358
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000
that spells out precisely
the issues between us

359
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000
that both sides
agree to address.

360
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000
What should I do?

361
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000
-Well. it's. it's easy. Yair.
You just. you--

362
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
Larsen:
Um...

363
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000
That's not for me to say.

364
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000
Yair. trust that you need
no road map.

365
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000
The way will show itself.

366
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
That is completely
fucking stupid.

367
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000
Abu Ala.
His glass is empty.

368
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
Thank you. Toril.

369
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000
It's good wine. yes?

370
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
Yes. Wine. yes.

371
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000
Dinner is excellent.

372
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
-Thank you.
-Larsen: Yes. it is.

373
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
But Hassan. you've barely
touched your food.

374
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000
Hassan is from Gaza.

375
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
where they are all fishermen.

376
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
but hate the sight of fish.

377
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
Jan
What am I supposed

378
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
when he asks
where you are?

379
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000
-Tell him it's a family issue.

380
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Jan. things are moving
faster than we expected.

381
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
I have to stay.

382
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
-

383
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000
-No more. Larsen. No more!

384
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
I couldn't possibly
have another sip.

385
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000
Yes. Terje.
No more for me. too.

386
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Okay. who's next? Abu Ala.
what about your father?

387
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
Yes. it's your turn.
Tell us.

388
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Qurie:
He was born in a village

389
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000
just outside Jerusalem.

390
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
As a child. he would
take me to the Old City.

391
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000
where the very stones
speak to you.

392
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Through the winding streets
we would go.

393
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:32.000
until we would emerge
and stand before it.

394
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:38.000
Then he would say.
"There. There. Ahmed.

395
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000
"That is the al-Aqsa mosque.

396
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000
"The beating heart of Jerusalem.

397
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000
"Wherever you go. boy.

398
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000
"you must always hold it.

399
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000
"and this city. here.

400
00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000
For it will always be
your home."

401
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
-Larsen: And finally...

402
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000
Hassan.

403
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.000
The. uh. petty bourgeois
construct of family

404
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
does not interest me.

405
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
The struggle against
the Western capitalist

406
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000
That is my father.

407
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000
-That's it.

408
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
No more sourpuss from him.

409
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000
Right. I have a joke.

410
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000
-Ron.
-No. it's good. It's good.

411
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000
Interpol. the CIA.

412
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000
and the Mossad.
are chasing a rabbit.

413
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000
They go to the edge
of the forest.

414
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
Interpol searches the forest.
but they can find no rabbit.

415
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000
The CIA burns down the forest.
but still. no rabbit.

416
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:05.000
Then Mossad says.
"Give us 30 minutes."

417
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
They go in.
Half-hour later. they come out

418
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
with a grizzly bear
in a headlock.

419
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
with a broken nose
and a black eye.

420
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000
and the bear is yelling--

421
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
-"Okay. I'm a rabbit!
I'm a rabbit!"

422
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
Pundak:
Oh. Mr. Lenin

423
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000
I want to tell a joke.

424
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000
A man is married 40 years.

425
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Then. his wife. she dies.

426
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000
After the funeral.
after all are gone.

427
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000
he sits alone in his house.

428
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000
The shadow of loneliness
falls upon him.

429
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000
In his solitude.

430
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000
he cries out.
"I am all alone!

431
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000
"What will I do now?

432
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000
"I have no wife!

433
00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000
"No-- No one to
tell me what to do!

434
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
No one to tell me
what to say..."

435
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000
"I am all alone.

436
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000
"I am all alone.
I am all alo--

437
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000
-All alone! I am all alone!"
-

438
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
He looks like Arafat!
No...

439
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Crazy Arafat
gestures on TV!

440
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000
Do not insult the chairman.

441
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000
You insult the chairman.
you insult us!

442
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
Abu Ala. I didn't mean--
It was a joke--

443
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
You think we are
just here as us?

444
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
-We are the head
and arms of him!

445
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000
Friends. please. please.
please. please.

446
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000
We are the head
and arms of him!

447
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000
-Larsen: Please. please!
-

448
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000
We will bury you before you
take our honor--

449
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000
I have brought waffles.

450
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000
Oh! There she is.

451
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000
The one I love is here.

452
00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000
Please. Uh. please.
Sit. gentlemen. Sit.

453
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000
Sit.

454
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000
This is the waffle recipe
of my mother.

455
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000
passed down from her mother.

456
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
It is simple. but precise.

457
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.000
Vanilla. sugar...

458
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000
Butter...

459
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000
Buttermilk...

460
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000
Flour...

461
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.000
And the secret is the cardamom.

462
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000
For the serving.

463
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
first you spread
the whipped cream

464
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
and the raspberry.

465
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000
and then you eat.

466
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

467
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000
Mmm.

468
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000
-Wow.
-All: Mmm...

469
00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Qurie:
Good. Very good.

470
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000
Pundak:
Very. very good.

471
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000
I propose...

472
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000
that we agree that
there are certain subjects--

473
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.000
people-- we do not discuss.

474
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000
just as when we are in there.

475
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Red lines.

476
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000
Which we do not cross.

477
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000
Yes. Here. let us be friends.

478
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000
Type everything up on these.

479
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000
This way.
if either side leaks it.

480
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000
the other can claim

481
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000
the entire thing
is an unofficial idea

482
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000
concocted by your organization.

483
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000
Larsen:
Gentlemen. thank you

484
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:58.000
for your willingness
to take part in these

485
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000
Uh. make sure you've left
nothing behind. No traces.

486
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000
Yes? Good. good. good.

487
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:12.000
So. here are the copies
of the new DOP.

488
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000
And for God sake.
guard them with your life.

489
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000
One last order of business
before you go.

490
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000
When we're speaking
on the phone from now on.

491
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000
we'll refer to Israel
as "the little country."

492
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000
Prime Minister Rabin

493
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000
will be "the grandfather."
Shimon Peres. "the father."

494
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000
Yossi Beilin. "the son."

495
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000
The PLO we'll call
"those across the sea."

496
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000
Chairman Arafat

497
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000
will be "the grandfather."
of course. also.

498
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000
And Abu Ala. uh...

499
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000
"Puntoffle."

500
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
-What?
-

501
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000
It means "slipper."
Abu Ala. in Yiddish.

502
00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000
You are an even stranger people
than I imagined.

503
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000
All right.

504
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000
-I'll see you at home.
-Okay.

505
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000
May your travels be safe.

506
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000
And yours.

507
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000
You are my first...

508
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000
Jew.

509
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000
I hope I was not too stringy.

510
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000
A bit.

511
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000
But still better than fish.

512
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000
Fly well. friends.
Be safe.

513
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000
With those two.
we can go no further.

514
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000
We must deal directly
with the Israeli government.

515
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000
Tell Yossi Beilin
it's time to upgrade.

516
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000
or this is over.

517
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000
-

518
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000
Yossi. the progress
that was made

519
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000
in one two-day meeting.
it's beyond imagination.

520
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000
and the Palestinians have
told me they want to return.

521
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000
Excellent.

522
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000
So you must see
it's time now to upgrade

523
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000
the Israeli delegation. yes?

524
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000
Upgrade?

525
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000
Terje. Israel has
no delegation to upgrade.

526
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000
Look at it from the other side.

527
00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000
These are ministers from the PLO

528
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000
who are risking their lives.

529
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000
Which as deputy foreign minister
of the State of Israel

530
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000
is none of my concern.

531
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000
We've got to give
them something.

532
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.000
Can I least tell them that
Peres is behind this?

533
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000
He doesn't know?

534
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000
What-- But you--

535
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000
-You told me--
-I told you what?

536
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000
Terje. when people talk to you.

537
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.000
you should really pay attention
to what they actually say.

538
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000
And not just listen for
whatever you want to hear.

539
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000
If and when something occurs

540
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000
that I deem worthy enough

541
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000
to bring to the foreign
minister's attention.

542
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000
then he will know.

543
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:49.000
For now. I and I alone know.

544
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000
Here I was worried
the Palestinians are

545
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000
-It turns out it's
the fucking Israelis.

546
00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Well. things are a bit more
complicated than we thought.

547
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000
Complicated? Are you serious?

548
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000
Mona. you told me that
Peres was on board.

549
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000
And now Beilin is saying
the opposite.

550
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000
Look. I want to help
as much as you do.

551
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
But we are government officials

552
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000
who could now be accused
of conspiring

553
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000
with another government's
official. We...

554
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000
We could be fired.
Jailed. Worse.

555
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000
Wait. Wait. What if
we're missing something?

556
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000
We're not telling Holst.

557
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.000
in order to protect him
and the ministry.

558
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000
What if Beilin is just
doing the same?

559
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000
Look. the moment he tells Peres.

560
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000
Peres will have to tell
Prime Minister Rabin.

561
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000
and then things
will become official.

562
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000
And once they're official.

563
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000
then this whole channel is over.

564
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000
So. as long as Peres
remains in the dark.

565
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000
then Beilin can keep
pushing the process forward.

566
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000
See how far things go.

567
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Oh. I see.

568
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000
So then we push on.

569
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
Right?

570
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000
One more meeting.

571
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000
Discreet. Under wraps.

572
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.000
But Mona. we need an upgrade

573
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000
from the Israeli delegation.
or this won't work.

574
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000
Yeah. I know.

575
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000
Reporter:
In response to the

576
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000
between Israeli and
Palestinian civilians.

577
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000
Prime Minister Rabin
has sealed Gaza.

578
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000
Yitzhak Rabin:
On one hand.

579
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000
we would like the Gazans
to work in Israel.

580
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000
because otherwise.

581
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000
they don't have
any source of income

582
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000
to sustain themselves.

583
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000
At the same time.
I am responsible

584
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000
for the security
of the people of Israel.

585
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.000
And how to mitigate
between the two.

586
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000
this is the key problem.

587
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000
Beilin
For God's sake. Terje.

588
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000
our people are being
murdered in the streets!

589
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000
If our grandfather
did not close the border.

590
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.000
-he would have been
hounded from office.

591
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000
I more than understand.
I empathize.

592
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000
But those across the sea
are emphatic.

593
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.000
They say the little country
must upgrade their delegation.

594
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000
Beilin:
You tell Puntoffle

595
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.000
something on the table
of substance.

596
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000
then we will consider
his request.

597
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000
-But they are not--
-

598
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000
Qurie
Larsen? Larsen?

599
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.000
What do they say?

600
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.000
Puntoffle. hello.
The son. uh.

601
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000
wishes me to
respectfully inform you

602
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.000
that. uh. when a more
substantial offer

603
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:36.000
uh. your request for.
uh. an upgrade. uh.

604
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.000
Qurie:
Fuck him!

605
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000
We have offered to take
Gaza off their hands!

606
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.000
We are the ones whose lives
hang in the balance!

607
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.000
They will not upgrade.
so I will not return.

608
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.000
They will upgrade.

609
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.000
-Terje--
-Qurie:  They will?

610
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.000
-Larsen: Uh. yeah.
-Qurie:  Who are they sending?

611
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000
-What are you doing?
-I don't know the details yet.

612
00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000
but. but an upgrade is coming.

613
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000
Qurie:
How do you know this?

614
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000
Uh. Mona told me.

615
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.000
-What?
-She's met with the son

616
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000
and she made him promise
that if you return to Oslo.

617
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.000
then they'll send an upgrade.

618
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000
Guaranteed.

619
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000
-Qurie:  Mona has done this?
-Yeah.

620
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000
Qurie:
Swear it to me. Larsen.

621
00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000
On the soul of your wife.

622
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.000
I swear on the soul of my wife.

623
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.000
You've got to trust me.

624
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000
Qurie:
I trust Mona.

625
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000
Without her. you are nothing.

626
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.000
Book the flight.

627
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000
Thank you.

628
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000
-Mona: Ahem.

629
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Whoo.

630
00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.000
Do you have any idea
what you have done?

631
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000
You have promised
something I cannot do.

632
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000
-But Yossi will upgrade.
-How do you know that?

633
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000
-Because. Mona. He will.
-That's not an answer. Terje.

634
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.000
Okay. darling.

635
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000
just look at all we've achieved.

636
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000
That you have now jeopardized
by your recklessness.

637
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000
By your total disregard
of everything we agreed to.

638
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000
A hundred years of hatred
and bloodshed teetering

639
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000
We've gotta do
whatever it takes.

640
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000
Except lying to them. Terje!

641
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.000
-Only a bungling amateur lies.
-Oh. God.

642
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000
You are so fucking Norwegian!

643
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.000
Everything is a fucking problem.

644
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000
Everything is an objection!

645
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000
I am on the phone with
them day and night.

646
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000
fighting to stay on my feet.

647
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.000
and all you want me to do
is sink to my fucking knees!

648
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000
This is finished. Terje.

649
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000
It's finished.

650
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000
Unless we do one thing.

651
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.000
What?

652
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000
Tell Holst what we are doing.

653
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:14.000
-No. No. Mona.
He's a megalomaniac.

654
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:18.000
And now. that megalomaniac
is exactly what we need.

655
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000
Holst does nothing
in half measures.

656
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000
If we can convince him.

657
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.000
he'll throw the full weight
of the ministry behind us.

658
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.000
He will help us
get that upgrade.

659
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.000
and then we will
make this happen.

660
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000
Larsen:
You...

661
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.000
are the most extraordinary woman

662
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000
-who has ever lived.
-No. Terje. we don't

663
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000
-There are no words...
-Terje. we don't have

664
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.000
-to describe how
wonderful you are.

665
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.000
The violation of protocol
has been totally inappropriate.

666
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000
-I agree.
-My God. the risks.

667
00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.000
Not even a security detail.

668
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000
That was Larsen's idea.

669
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.000
Driving alone.
middle of the night.

670
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.000
-Again Larsen.
-Mmm.

671
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.000
Minister Holst.

672
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.000
in but one meeting.
the Israelis and ourselves

673
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.000
have made progress
beyond all hopes.

674
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000
With your support.

675
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:20.000
our secret channel

676
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:23.000
will continue to feed
fresh water

677
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.000
to the official
Washington-sponsored talks.

678
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:37.000
You are your nation's
greatest statesman.

679
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:41.000
Only you can move
our two peoples towards

680
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000
a true and lasting peace.

681
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.000
At all further meetings.

682
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.000
there will be an elite.
two-man security detail

683
00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.000
chosen by me.

684
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000
Agreed.

685
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000
My deputy. Jan Egeland.

686
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.000
-will run all further liaisons
between the PLO and--

687
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000
It must be Larsen.

688
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.000
His ways are strange.

689
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.000
but through his methods.

690
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:18.000
we have begun a true dialogue
between our peoples.

691
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.000
If we are to succeed.
it must be him.

692
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:26.000
for this one speaks truth
to both sides.

693
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.000
He does not lie.

694
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:33.000
-Do you. Larsen?
-No.

695
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000
Thank you. Minister Holst.

696
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000
-We will meet again.
-Thank you.

697
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000
Nice to have another
professor with us.

698
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000
Welcome. Hope you
enjoyed your flight.

699
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000
Such a pleasure
to meet you.

700
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:06.000
Your security detail
is calling attention.

701
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.000
Yes. um. sorry. Uh...

702
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000
Hirschfeld:
Are there any details

703
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000
Obviously. a great
distance still to go.

704
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000
but as you heard from Yossi.

705
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000
the progress--
it's been dizzying.

706
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:24.000
We should be sitting down.
ah?

707
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000
I have to take a piss.

708
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000
Gentlemen. I'd like
to introduce Uri Savir.

709
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:25.000
director general of the
Israeli Foreign Ministry.

710
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:29.000
Uri Savir. please meet Abu Ala.

711
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000
and Hassan Asfour.

712
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:37.000
I am here at
the personal request

713
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.000
and as the voice
of Shimon Peres.

714
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:50.000
And I am here at
the personal request

715
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.000
and as the voice
of Yasser Arafat.

716
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000
Welcome to Oslo.

717
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000
Let us begin.

718
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.000
The idea of this DOP
was yours. yes?

719
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000
Yes. it was.

720
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:47.000
What is your official response
to our concrete proposals there?

721
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.000
I have no response
to an unofficial document.

722
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:56.000
What I have is
a mandate to negotiate

723
00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.000
in full with you.

724
00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000
What you have all done
in this room so far

725
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.000
is discuss the idea of peace.

726
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:08.000
I have been sent here
to try and negotiate

727
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000
So...

728
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:14.000
Let us put our cards
on the table.

729
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.000
In my country.

730
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.000
we see you as terrorists
and murderers

731
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.000
who wish to drive us
into the sea.

732
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.000
You killed our athletes
in Munich.

733
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:35.000
Murdered our school children
in Ma'alot.

734
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:39.000
invaded us
and spilled our blood

735
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:42.000
the highest holy day we have.

736
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000
So you will understand
when I say

737
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:50.000
that we do not view you as
ideal partners for peace.

738
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:57.000
In my country.
we see you as a savage nation.

739
00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.000
whose army shoots our children
for sport.

740
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.000
Your people persecuted
for your faith--

741
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:09.000
murdered in Pogroms.
fled to Palestine.

742
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.000
where you were
left alone to pray.

743
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.000
and strive. and grow strong.

744
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:18.000
And when you became strong.

745
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.000
you burned our homes.

746
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000
drove a million people
from Palestine.

747
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000
and claim to this day

748
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:28.000
that there was never
such a thing as Palestine!

749
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:35.000
So. you will understand
our mistrust of you

750
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:38.000
as ideal partners for peace.

751
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000
Okay.

752
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:49.000
Now that we've both
swung our dicks.

753
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.000
let me say this.

754
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:57.000
We are tired of being
at war with you.

755
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:04.000
We are committed to ending
the cycle of violence

756
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000
But I want to be clear.

757
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.000
Israel will not sacrifice
its security.

758
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:12.000
And you will never have
that security. Mr. Savir.

759
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:15.000
until you make peace with us.

760
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000
For our region of the world

761
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:20.000
will never accept you
until we accept you.

762
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:33.000
Much of this.
we are willing to discuss.

763
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:34.000
But let me be clear.

764
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:37.000
Israel will not negotiate
over the sovereignty

765
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:38.000
of the city of Jerusalem.

766
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000
We will never relinquish
our right to Jerusalem.

767
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:44.000
just as we will never
relinquish our right

768
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000
to a Palestinian state.

769
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000
The possibility of
a Palestinian state

770
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000
without Jerusalem as its capital

771
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000
is a viable topic.

772
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.000
if you're willing to drop
your further impossible demand

773
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.000
that all issues not
resolved in this DOP

774
00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.000
be referred to third-party
international arbitration.

775
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.000
You are Goliath to our David!

776
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.000
A neutral arbitrator
is essential.

777
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:08.000
Give me one country
that voluntary cedes

778
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000
like you're proposing we do.

779
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:13.000
The newly formed
European Union

780
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:16.000
Not those fucking pansies.
I mean a real country.

781
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000
We can talk in circles.

782
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000
or we can start to
get something done.

783
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000
Now. we are willing to
relinquish control of Gaza--

784
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:26.000
Which we will accept.
on condition that you

785
00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:29.000
relinquish control
of Jericho to us

786
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.000
at the same time.

787
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.000
Are you fucking serious?

788
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000
Gaza alone would
make us an island.

789
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:37.000
surrounded by a sea
of Israeli forces.

790
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.000
I've been talking of nothing

791
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.000
but Israel's concern
for our security.

792
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:44.000
and now you're asking us
to give you control of a city

793
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:47.000
-20 kilometers
from Jerusalem?

794
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:50.000
our city in our West Bank!

795
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:53.000
Your country divides
my people in two!

796
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.000
So we must have
a foothold in Gaza

797
00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.000
and the West Bank!

798
00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.000
Savir:
We'll give you Gaza.

799
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
and when you show
you can stop

800
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000
the killing of our
soldiers in Gaza.

801
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
then we'll talk about Jericho.

802
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000
That is from
Shimon Peres himself.

803
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
I leave it.

804
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
You two... come with me.

805
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Alone.

806
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000
-Larsen: Uri--
-Shh. shh!

807
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
My God. this day!

808
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000
I mean. life is nothing
if not surprising.

809
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000
-Yes. yes.
That's very. very true.

810
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Come. Let's have a dance.

811
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
I'll tell you a secret.

812
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
I was nervous as hell
to meet those two.

813
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000
First members of the PLO

814
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
I've ever been
face-to-face with.

815
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
So what do you think of them?

816
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Not the demons I was expecting.

817
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
This Ahmed--
What do you call him?

818
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
-Abu Ala.
-Abu Ala.

819
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Mmm-hmm.

820
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
I can do business with this man.

821
01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
I think this is going to work.

822
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
It's okay.

823
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
-There's been a leak.
-What?

824
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Agence France-Presse
is reporting a secret

825
01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
between Israel and the PLO.

826
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000
A small piece. buried.
but our press have read it

827
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000
and they want to know
what the hell is going on.

828
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.000
My God. How are we going
to break this news to Holst?

829
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
We're not going to tell him.

830
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000
You'll release a statement

831
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000
that Agence France-Presse
is clearly referring to

832
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
on the Palestinian
refugee situation

833
01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
that we are officially.

834
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000
and openly. about to host.

835
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000
We're not lying. Jan.

836
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000
We're choosing
our words carefully.

837
01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Savir:
I told everyone in my office

838
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
I'm off to Paris
for the weekend.

839
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
I land at De Gaulle.

840
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
take the car to the hotel.

841
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000
check in. go to my room.

842
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
After 20 minutes.

843
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.000
I hang the "Do Not Disturb"
sign on the door.

844
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
and head back to the airport...

845
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
-Incognito.

846
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000
The flight from Paris
here to Oslo.

847
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
completely packed...

848
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
with Iranians!

849
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000
-Whoa!
-Oh. ho-ho-ho!

850
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
What do you think I did. huh?

851
01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000
-I shit my pants.
-

852
01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Thank you so much.
Abu Ala. you were right.

853
01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
This woman is
a national treasure.

854
01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Qurie:
Aah. just you wait!

855
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
For now. we are approaching

856
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
the hour of the waffles!

857
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Savir:
Look who's here. Mona!

858
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Qurie:
Hey. hey. hey!

859
01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000
-We must toast Mona.
-Yes.

860
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
-No. no. no. no. no--
-We must praise you.

861
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000
No. you can't stop us.
We must praise you.

862
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000
To Mona.

863
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Without her. we are nothing.

864
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
-Yes. To Mona.
-To Mona!

865
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
All
Mona! Mona! Mona!

866
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000
-Mona! Mona! Mona! Mona!
-

867
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Qurie:
Last night. in there.

868
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000
you said the eventuality

869
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
-of a Palestinian state...
-Savir: I did not!

870
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
-I did not.
-...is a viable topic

871
01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000
-Please. Din--
-Possibility of the Palestinian

872
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Dinner is about to be served.
gentlemen.

873
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000
If you want
to discuss the idea

874
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
of the eventuality
of a Palestinian state.

875
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
then first you must address
our security concerns.

876
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Your concerns are demands.

877
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
and I will not be demanded to.

878
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Savir:
We must have proof

879
01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
will cease all
terrorist activities

880
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
against all Israeli citizens.
Hassan.

881
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Hassan.
Hassan! I'm right here.

882
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000
You want to say something.
say it to my face.

883
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Okay.

884
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
You sit there. comrade.

885
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
with your colonial superiority.

886
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.000
dictating what our future
will or will not be.

887
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Yet somehow.

888
01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
with your intelligence service.
your army.

889
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
your nuclear weapons.

890
01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.000
you are threatened by us.

891
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000
So. are you the master
who must be obeyed.

892
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
or the victim who
must be coddled.

893
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
because you cannot be both!

894
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Tell me something. Hassan.

895
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Did you get those talking points

896
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000
mailed to you from Moscow?

897
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Or did you copy
them down yourself?

898
01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.000
-Your future will be
dictated by us!

899
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000
If you think we are
going to roll over

900
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
on the issue of our security.

901
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
you are sorely mistaken!

902
01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Your nation is surrounded
by 350 million of us!

903
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.000
You will have no security
until we have our dignity.

904
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Until we have security.

905
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000
-you will have nothing.
-Now you reveal

906
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Now we see the scoundrel
you are!

907
01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
I'm fine.
It's all right.

908
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
I'm fine.

909
01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Forgive my outburst.

910
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000
It was unworthy.

911
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Please allow me to make amends.

912
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Perhaps you and I
could walk together.

913
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
If you wish.

914
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.000
I admire the way you fight.

915
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Thank you.

916
01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:30.000
I admire your passion.

917
01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
My daughter says. with me.

918
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000
passion is another word
for pigheaded.

919
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000
She says. "Papa.
all you care about

920
01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
I say. "Maya.

921
01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
"if a man does not fight
for what he believes.

922
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000
who is he?"

923
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Maya?

924
01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Yes. My daughter.

925
01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.000
My daughter is named Maya.

926
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.000
My youngest.
She is the light

927
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000
I wish my father
had lived to see this.

928
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Though he would not have been
crazy about the weather.

929
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
This is a true tragedy
that we were approached

930
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
by the Norwegians.

931
01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000
and not the Californians.

932
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
-Oh. my God.
Are they laughing?

933
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.000
If you take one more step.

934
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Is your father still with us?

935
01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000
My father lives in Abu Dis.

936
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
near Jerusalem.

937
01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Do you want me to take
a letter to him.

938
01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000
bring a message from you?

939
01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
No.

940
01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.000
The day I am able to
leave Tunis and return.

941
01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.000
that is the day
he and I will speak.

942
01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
But thank you.

943
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Savir:
Abu Ala.

944
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000
our peoples live in the past.

945
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Both obsessing over...

946
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.000
over what we have lost.

947
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Let us find a way
to live in the present.

948
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Together.

949
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.000
We will agree to drop our demand

950
01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000
that outstanding
quarrels between us

951
01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:51.000
be referred to third-party
international arbitration.

952
01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
And we will agree

953
01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000
to negotiate
turning over Gaza...

954
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
and Jericho.

955
01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
You and I. Abu Ala...

956
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000
We are going to
change the world.

957
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
What the fuck is this?

958
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Who the fuck negotiated this?

959
01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
You try negotiating this.

960
01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000
It's a working document.

961
01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.000
It's a fucking Hanukkah present
to Yasser Arafat.

962
01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.000
-Savir:
This is what Peres wanted.

963
01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Peres answers to Rabin
just like the rest of us.

964
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:32.000
This flies in the face of
40 years of Israeli policy.

965
01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
We turn over control of Gaza.

966
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
and Jericho?

967
01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:43.000
The inclusion of Jerusalem
in Palestinian self-rule?

968
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:47.000
-Joel. these are just
talking points--

969
01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Is this why our grandparents
founded this country?

970
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
So we could do this?

971
01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
In four months. we've gone
from not even conceiving

972
01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000
of meeting these people to that.

973
01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Forty years. nothing.

974
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Now four months. that.

975
01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Every negotiating round.

976
01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.000
my counterpart calls
PLO headquarters in Tunis.

977
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000
and speaks directly to Arafat.

978
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Every point.

979
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Every concession
these men have made

980
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:19.000
has been signed off on
by Arafat.

981
01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Who in the government
knows this document exists?

982
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
The three of us. and Peres.

983
01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
And Rabin.

984
01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
It's written like mush.

985
01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.000
The janitor in my law firm
would have done a better job.

986
01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Every sentence here
could be read to mean

987
01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.000
anything by either side.

988
01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
It's a fucking time bomb.

989
01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
So diffuse it. Joel.

990
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Rabin trusts you.
and you alone. to do it.

991
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
We are not lawyers.
We need your expertise.

992
01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Go through this "mush."

993
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Figure out if it can be
turned into

994
01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.000
a real binding document or not.

995
01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Nothing more can happen
between Israel and the PLO

996
01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000
unless you tell us it's a go.

997
01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000
-Shalom. friends.
-Abu Ala.

998
01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Hassan.
it is my great pleasure

999
01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
-to introduce you to--
-They know who I am

1000
01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
We don't have time
for chit-chat.

1001
01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.000
I've read the text

1002
01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
of the joint document
created here.

1003
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:08.000
and I've come with 200
questions about this document.

1004
01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
We reject your questions.

1005
01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:15.000
as we reject your tone.

1006
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:23.000
These questions come directly
from Yitzhak Rabin.

1007
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.000
I am here at his
personal request.

1008
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
When you're speaking to me.

1009
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.000
you're speaking to
the prime minister of Israel.

1010
01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
I have until 0600 hours.

1011
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
We'll need to work
through the night.

1012
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Let's get started.

1013
01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Do you know who this man is?

1014
01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Joel Singer wrote the
military rules of engagement

1015
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000
the Zionist army used
to crush our people.

1016
01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:22.000
We are now in the boat
with the enemy himself.

1017
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Each of these 200 questions
requires a precise answer.

1018
01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
When I'm satisfied
with your answer.

1019
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.000
we'll move on to
the next question.

1020
01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
"If the State of Israel

1021
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.000
"agrees to cede
control of Jericho

1022
01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
"and its surrounding
territory.

1023
01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000
"will the proposed
Palestinian authority

1024
01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.000
"collect Israeli garbage?

1025
01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Or only Palestinian garbage?"

1026
01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.000
This is your question?

1027
01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Well. this is my first question.

1028
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.000
No. we will not collect
Israeli garbage.

1029
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.000
"If the State of Israel agrees
to cede control of Jericho

1030
01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.000
"and its surrounding territory.

1031
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
"will the proposed
Palestinian authority

1032
01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.000
"be prepared to send

1033
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
"tax collectors

1034
01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.000
into Israeli settlements?"

1035
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Mr. Singer. we did not
fly across the world

1036
01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
to speak of garbage and taxes.

1037
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Garbage and taxes

1038
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.000
is what a government does.

1039
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
If you want us to
give you the authority

1040
01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.000
to be a government.
then this joint document

1041
01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.000
must spell out exactly how

1042
01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:57.000
you will be a government.

1043
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
I must speak with Tunis.

1044
01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
-

1045
01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Coffee?

1046
01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
How many times
is Mr. Qurie going to do this?

1047
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:45.000
We've already lost
an hour and a half.

1048
01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Singer:
Why are you doing this?

1049
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
You and your husband?

1050
01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Well. if you were
in our shoes. Mr. Singer.

1051
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
wouldn't you do the same?

1052
01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000
No.

1053
01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
That's why I'm asking.

1054
01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Terje and I were touring Gaza.

1055
01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Part of my work while
I was stationed in the region.

1056
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:34.000
We took a wrong turn
down an alley.

1057
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000
We were fine.

1058
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Others were not.

1059
01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.000
There were two boys
facing each other.

1060
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:49.000
One in uniform.
One in jeans.

1061
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.000
But on their faces.
the same fear.

1062
01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000
The same desperate desire
to be anywhere but here.

1063
01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000
To not be doing this
to the other boy.

1064
01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Now. if you'll excuse me.

1065
01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000
I understand our role here.

1066
01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000
But I think you should know...

1067
01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Whenever Abu Ala
goes to use the phone

1068
01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
he does not call Tunis.

1069
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Who does he call?

1070
01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
No one.

1071
01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:00.000
He sits in his room.
staring at the wall.

1072
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
When enough time for
a phone call has passed.

1073
01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000
he comes back in
with new instructions.

1074
01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Thank you.

1075
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
-Trond?
-Yeah?

1076
01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Just keep this between
you and me. Yes?

1077
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Don't tell Mona.
I'll take care of it.

1078
01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:42.000
So. the phrase
"Israeli settlements

1079
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:47.000
abutting the city of Jericho."
is vague and imprecise.

1080
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:51.000
-Which settlements. what other--
-Settlements and boundaries.

1081
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
as per article four. page 32.

1082
01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:57.000
of the working document
of the official

1083
01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Singer:
Show me the language

1084
01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:06.000
My copy of this document
resides here.

1085
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Your copy is your business.

1086
01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Question number 200.

1087
01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Are you willing to state herein

1088
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
that you recognize
the legitimacy

1089
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
of the State of Israel?

1090
01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.000
We will agree in this document

1091
01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:39.000
to accept the existence
of the State of Israel.

1092
01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:43.000
We know we exist.
and we know you see

1093
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
What this document requires
is for you to acknowledge

1094
01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.000
the legitimacy of our existence.

1095
01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Qurie:
Mr. Singer.

1096
01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
when you are willing
to state herein

1097
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.000
that the Palestine Liberation
Organization is the official

1098
01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.000
voice of the Palestinian people.

1099
01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:03.000
then we will revisit
your legitimacy.

1100
01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Your answers to my questions
were clear and direct.

1101
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000
for which you have
our thanks and our respect.

1102
01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
On behalf of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin

1103
01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
and the State of Israel.

1104
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.000
we make this offer
that this back channel

1105
01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.000
will become
the official channel.

1106
01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:43.000
But what of the
Washington-sponsored talks?

1107
01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:46.000
They'll continue.
and no one involved

1108
01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.000
will know that what
they are doing is now

1109
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
nothing but a ruse.

1110
01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.000
You both will negotiate.

1111
01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.000
You and I will write.

1112
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:04.000
In this room.
we four will forge peace.

1113
01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
or there will be no peace.

1114
01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Lighter.

1115
01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.000
-Mona: Jan.
you cannot drop out.

1116
01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
And if you have
a shred of sense left.

1117
01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
But this process needs you.

1118
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.000
-Look at what has just happened!
-Exactly. Look.

1119
01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.000
I mean. my God. it's one thing
for a peace process

1120
01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.000
to have a secret back channel.

1121
01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Now the actual
peace process itself

1122
01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.000
-Yes. I know. but--
-The future of two

1123
01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
being decided
without accountability.

1124
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
without transparency.
by a handful of men

1125
01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
who have no mandate to do so.

1126
01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.000
-But that was always the ca--
-If you continue down this path.

1127
01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.000
and the world finds out
what you are all doing.

1128
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
there will be riots.

1129
01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Blood will be spilled.

1130
01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
When I was a young man.

1131
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
I told my mother
that my dearest wish

1132
01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
was to become a fighter pilot.

1133
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
She said she would allow it
on one condition:

1134
01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:31.000
that I fly very slowly.
and very close to the ground.

1135
01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:34.000
I replied. "But. Mother.
for a pilot to be safe.

1136
01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
he must fly very fast.
and very high."

1137
01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
-Peres: I adore your shoes.

1138
01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
-Larsen: Oh. thank you.
-Peres: Do you have

1139
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000
or break them in yourself?

1140
01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Stretched. of course.

1141
01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000
That way. they fit like a glove.

1142
01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Shimon. if you could.

1143
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Arafat. and the PLO.

1144
01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Look. if this deal
does not happen.

1145
01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
the PLO will be so hollowed out.

1146
01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
so bereft of victories

1147
01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
it may well cease to exist.

1148
01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
This. we cannot allow.

1149
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:04.000
For Israel needs
the PLO to exist.

1150
01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Arafat is tricky.
but he is a man.

1151
01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
And a man aches
for one thing above all:

1152
01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
his home.

1153
01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Tell Uri to tell Abu Ala

1154
01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.000
that if Arafat makes
this deal with us.

1155
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.000
I will allow him and the rest
of the PLO leadership

1156
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
to return to Gaza.

1157
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Beilin:
Arafat.

1158
01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
and the PLO in Gaza?

1159
01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:30.000
If we are to be bold.
it must be now.

1160
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Get them all back to Oslo
for one last round.

1161
01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
And we tell
the Americans nothing.

1162
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
But Shimon. nothing?

1163
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
I was this close to making peace

1164
01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
with King Hussein
and the Jordanians.

1165
01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
until the Americans got wind.
and scuttled it.

1166
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
This. they will not scuttle.

1167
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.000
But the Americans could
ask us directly. any moment.

1168
01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:51.000
If they ask any of us.

1169
01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
we say the back
channel is closed.

1170
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
You mean flat-out lie?

1171
01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000
What is a lie but a dream
that could come true?

1172
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Fast and high. my friends.

1173
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.000
It is the only way.

BBC anchor
As Israel's assault

1175
01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
the refugees
streaming toward Beirut

1176
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:19.000
have now reached
upwards of 200.000.

1177
01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
The Palestinians have
spent the day trapped

1178
01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
between the Lebanese army
and Israel's allies.

1179
01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
The Palestinians have been
marching for a mile

1180
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
through this desolate
nomad's land.

1181
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
when they came under fire.

1182
01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000
A tank round landed
only a hundred yards

1183
01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.000
-while machine gunfire

1184
01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Many of the Palestinians
started to pray

1185
01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
as the gunfire
echoed around them.

1186
01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:48.000
It was a clear warning
to these men from

1187
01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
not to go any closer
to the border.

1188
01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Abu Ala. tomorrow
we will finish this.

BBC anchor
This man was seriously

1190
01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.000
-We will find a way.
-Reporters took him

1191
01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Tonight. the Palestinians
are still on the road.

1192
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
out in the open.

1193
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Two Palestinians
were hit by shrapnel

1194
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.000
from the SLA's fire.

1195
01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
and this evening.
the Lebanese prime minister

1196
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.000
announced he was stopping
any more aid reaching them.

1197
01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000
a clear attempt to increase
the world's concern.

1198
01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
and the Israeli's
embarrassment.

1199
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Robert Moore. ITN.
on the Israeli-

1200
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
-It's a disaster!
-Yair. what is?

1201
01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
-What's going on?
-Months of work ruined

1202
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
by that son of a bitch!

1203
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.000
What this Singer has brought.

1204
01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
it's. it's almost
a complete rewrite!

1205
01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
The DOP we made together.
it's disappeared.

1206
01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Singer took out that we agreed
to give them Jericho.

1207
01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:58.000
and he put in that they agreed
to everything we asked for.

1208
01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.000
You have to fix this.

1209
01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
-Yair. I can't--
-Hirschfeld: No. no!

1210
01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Mona. you are the one
they will listen to.

1211
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:06.000
No. I. I can only facilitate.
I cannot interfere.

1212
01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:09.000
No! You are part of this now.

1213
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
It has to be you.

1214
01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Go. In. Now!

1215
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.000
How--

1216
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Okay.

1217
01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Asfour:
This is not a "joint approach."

1218
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.000
-Larsen: Wait--
-This is an Israeli occupation.

1219
01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
You have no right

1220
01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.000
how our army will
deal with our people.

1221
01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Singer:
We are not going

1222
01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
until you agree.
as written there.

1223
01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.000
that the violence ceases
when you are in charge.

1224
01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Asfour:
Uh. we are in Tunis.

1225
01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Those who are occupied
began the Intifada.

1226
01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:54.000
It is theirs to end
when they see fit.

1227
01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Then why the fuck
are we talking to you?

1228
01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Joel. I am negotiating. yes?

1229
01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:00.000
-Then let me negotiate!
-Qurie: Uri. why do you

1230
01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.000
the historic compromises
we have already made?

1231
01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
You have made? Abu Ala.
we are giving you land.

1232
01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.000
-We are shrinking the size
of our country!

1233
01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.000
for you to give.
but to give back!

1234
01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
This is land you fucking lost
because you invaded us.

1235
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.000
and we kicked
your fucking ass.

1236
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
And where in this.
where is Jerusalem?

1237
01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
You put Jerusalem
back on the table.

1238
01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
and everything is over.

1239
01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
You go on like this.

1240
01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
you will never stop
being the occupier.

1241
01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
and we will never
stop fighting you!

1242
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Your fighting is killing
your own children!

1243
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Our fighting has forced you

1244
01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
to stand in this room.
and deal with us!

1245
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:36.000
My friend. my friend.
listen to me.

1246
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
-together we can fix this.
-Singer: He works for me!

1247
01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Let us be fucking clear. Joel.
You are here for Yitzhak.

1248
01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.000
-I'm here for Shimon.
-You are here with me.

1249
01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.000
to make these people.
for once.

1250
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
keep their fucking word.

1251
01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:49.000
-Enough! Enough!

1252
01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Eh. eh.

1253
01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:01.000
You will accept this document
that we've all agreed to.

1254
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.000
All of us. Or we are done.

1255
01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Write this down.

1256
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:43.000
At exactly 0900 hours.

1257
01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
28th of July. 1993.

1258
01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:50.000
The Oslo PLO-Israeli
channel was closed.

1259
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Listen to me. please.

1260
01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:15.000
You have fought and killed
each other for 50 years.

1261
01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Your mothers.
your daughters.

1262
01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
and nothing has changed.

1263
01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
The world has washed
its hands of this conflict

1264
01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
because it does not believe

1265
01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
that you can change.

1266
01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
No one else is coming
to help you.

1267
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
This is up to you.

1268
01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
You grow more isolated
by the year--

1269
01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
the day--

1270
01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.000
as your soldiers occupy land
you do not even want.

1271
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
That you are desperate
to leave.

1272
01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.000
And you. you are
stranded in Tunis.

1273
01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:54.000
yet here now. you are
being offered that land.

1274
01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
A return home.

1275
01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
To govern yourselves.

1276
01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
This is your chance.

1277
01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:07.000
You cannot afford
to miss this moment.

1278
01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Look at the risks you have
already taken together.

1279
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Now please. sit back down
and find a way.

1280
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Please.

1281
01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:50.000
I'm willing to start over.

1282
01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.000
See what we can see.

1283
01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Begin with article eight.

1284
01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:29.000
They are clearly open
to meeting you halfway

1285
01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.000
Savir:
End of article eight.

1286
01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:53.000
The sentence.
"Israel will continue to carry

1287
01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.000
must be followed
by the words

1288
01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
"for defending against
external threats

1289
01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.000
or terrorist threats."

1290
01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Qurie:
In article eight.

1291
01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:05.000
"external threats."
but not "terrorist threats."

1292
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Agreed.

1293
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:40.000
The long-standing
UN Resolution 242 and 338

1294
01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:43.000
criticizing
the Israeli occupation

1295
01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.000
must be included
in this document.

1296
01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
That. we categorically reject.

1297
01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
But if you are willing
to postpone discussion

1298
01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:53.000
-on the future of
Israeli settlements--

1299
01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
But.

1300
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.000
the right to return
for those displaced

1301
01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.000
in the '67 war.

1302
01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:15.000
this. we agree to postpone
to a later date.

1303
01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Savir:
And if you are willing to accept

1304
01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.000
our control of border security.

1305
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:28.000
we will withdraw
all our forces from Gaza.

1306
01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:31.000
and Jericho. at the same time.

1307
01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
The city of Jerusalem
will be capital for both.

1308
01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
Savir and Singer:
No!

1309
01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.000
-Larsen.
-Beilin

1310
01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
This is the son calling with
a message from the father.

1311
01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
The father says you need
to assemble your team

1312
01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.000
and fly tomorrow in secret
to Stockholm. Sweden.

1313
01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Tomorrow night.
the father will be attending

1314
01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:10.000
a state dinner over there.
and after dinner.

1315
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:14.000
he will meet you and your team
at the royal guest house.

1316
01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:18.000
And... then he will make it.

1317
01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Make what?

1318
01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Peace.

1319
01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
With those across the sea.

1320
01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
We are going to finish it.
Terje.

1321
01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Tomorrow night.

1322
01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:59.000
So. how long will you be
with Mr. Peres tonight?

1323
01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000
As long as Mr. Peres wishes.

1324
01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Terje:
Um. uh.

1325
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:09.000
perhaps we could get
something to eat?

1326
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
It's late.
Could that be arranged?

1327
01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
The kitchen is closed.

1328
01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Oh. Mr. Foreign Minister.

1329
01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
How was your function?

1330
01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Long.

1331
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
May I get you something
from the kitchen?

1332
01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
No. thank you.

1333
01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:28.000
This couple is not
on the official list

1334
01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
for the guest house.

1335
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Good.

1336
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
You may leave us.

1337
01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Holst is still
at the reception.

1338
01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
This is the latest draft.
with Singer's markings.

1339
01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Let's get started.

1340
01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.000
But where are the Palestinians?

1341
01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
The Palestinians are not coming.

1342
01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
We are doing this
on the phone.

1343
01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.000
You will ring Tunis.

1344
01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Tell them I'm calling.
and have them put

1345
01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Is the PLO leadership
expecting your call?

1346
01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
The PLO leadership

1347
01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:12.000
has never spoken to
the Israeli leadership.

1348
01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
But the chairman and I
are the only ones

1349
01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:18.000
who can make the necessary
and painful final compromises.

1350
01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Since he and I can have
no contact of any kind.

1351
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:25.000
we will use Holst
as our intermediary.

1352
01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Now dial Tunis.
and find Arafat.

1353
01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
The night is not young.
my friends.

1354
01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
and we have a long way to go.

1355
01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:41.000
"Dial Tunis"?
Like there's one

1356
01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:44.000
This is Arafat.
He's not reachable by phone.

1357
01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Oh...

1358
01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
-Where is Abu Ala?
-I don't know.

1359
01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:50.000
-Is he in Tunis?
-I don't know. Mona.

1360
01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
What are you doing?

1361
01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
I'm going to call
every possible number

1362
01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:55.000
where Abu Ala could be staying.

1363
01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
He'll know how to reach Arafat.

1364
01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
Oh. my God.

1365
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Christ! It's almost midnight.

1366
01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:37.000
We are running out of time.

1367
01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Mr. Peres has retired
for this evening.

1368
01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
so this office is closed.

1369
01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
No. Mr. Peres will be
joining us again

1370
01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
in a few moments.

1371
01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Uh. may we use
your copy machine?

1372
01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
-The copy machine is closed.
-Terje: Thank you.

1373
01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.000
Qurie
Hello?

1374
01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:00.000
-Terje.
-Qurie:  Can you hear me?

1375
01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
-Can you hear me?
-Yes. yes. Puntoffle.

1376
01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Listen to me.
I'm calling for the father.

1377
01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:09.000
He wishes to speak
with your grandfather.

1378
01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:13.000
He wants to finish it.
On this phone. Now.

1379
01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Do you understand?

1380
01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Qurie:
Yes. I do.

1381
01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
No. no. no. no. no.
Don't call me back.

1382
01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Qurie:
I will call you back.

1383
01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
-Puntoffle. listen--
-

1384
01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:38.000
I'm sorry. It's stuck
in the copy machine.

1385
01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:39.000
and I can't get it out.

1386
01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
Well. then ask her for help.

1387
01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:44.000
But she said
we could not use it.

1388
01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:46.000
I-I will fix it.

1389
01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Qurie
Larsen. I am here.

1390
01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Puntoffle. Thank God.

1391
01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Qurie:
I am with the grandfather.

1392
01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Terje:
Excellent.

1393
01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Qurie:
And with the entire

1394
01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:11.000
We have just informed them
of our channel.

1395
01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:14.000
and what is to now transpire.

1396
01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Wow. Okay.
And. uh... and...

1397
01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:21.000
The news.
How are they taking it?

1398
01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Qurie:
Let's move on.

1399
01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:28.000
The grandfather's English
is not as he wishes.

1400
01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Therefore. he asks
that I speak for and to him.

1401
01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
I understand.

1402
01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:39.000
Qurie:
And I ask that you. Larsen.

1403
01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
are the one I speak to.

1404
01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:45.000
For here.
what men begin together.

1405
01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
men must finish together.

1406
01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
I'll get Shimon.

1407
01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:09.000
It is a total breach
of protocol.

1408
01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:10.000
If you are uneasy
in any way--

1409
01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:13.000
I understand.
And it is.

1410
01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
But Johan Jorgen.
I think we must acknowledge

1411
01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
that now we are all
very far beyond

1412
01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:19.000
the bounds of protocol.

1413
01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Let us begin.

1414
01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
The father repeats his demand

1415
01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
regarding future settlements.

1416
01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Qurie:
No!

1417
01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Not unless UN Resolutions
242 and 338

1418
01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:54.000
are to be included
in this document!

1419
01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:55.000
-No!
-

1420
01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
-Okay.
-Qurie:  Official boundaries

1421
01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
of all Israeli settlements

1422
01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:00.000
abutting the city of Jericho

1423
01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:03.000
must be set by both parties.

1424
01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:06.000
Larsen:
The father says to tell

1425
01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:09.000
the little country has
already compromised

1426
01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Let me pass that on.

1427
01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:12.000
The grandfather says yes.

1428
01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Yes. He's. he's willing
to accept that.

1429
01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Yes? All right.
Good. Good. Thank you.

1430
01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Ugh. Um...

1431
01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:26.000
the grandfather says
he's going to bed.

1432
01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Call him when--
when you change your mind.

1433
01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:33.000
-Aah!
-Qurie:  We will accept

1434
01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:36.000
be in charge of
border security.

1435
01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:40.000
But our forces must
have joint control

1436
01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:41.000
of all checkpoints.

1437
01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Tell him our checkpoints.
our soldiers.

1438
01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:45.000
We will not cede this point.

1439
01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Qurie:
Tell him we will burn

1440
01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:53.000
and wage war upon you
until the last days of time!

1441
01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:00.000
But also that we are open
to a counterproposal.

1442
01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
We will accept

1443
01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:23.000
that the Palestine
Liberation Organization...

1444
01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
is the official voice

1445
01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
of the Palestinian people.

1446
01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Qurie:
We will accept...

1447
01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:41.000
the legitimacy of
the State of Israel.

1448
01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Jerusalem will remain
solely the capital of Israel.

1449
01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
-Qurie:  No!
-Non-negotiable!

1450
01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Qurie:
Larsen! Larsen!

1451
01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
This is not the bluffing!

1452
01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
Larsen:
Wait.

1453
01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:31.000
In the name of
constructive ambiguity.

1454
01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:42.000
we will accept that

1455
01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:48.000
in the final stage
of further negotiations.

1456
01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
the future of Jerusalem

1457
01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
will be addressed.

1458
01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:00.000
Qurie:
We accept this document.

1459
01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
As do we.

1460
01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Abu Ala...

1461
01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
what is that sound?

1462
01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:51.000
Qurie:
They are crying.

1463
01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
All of them.

1464
01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
They did not think

1465
01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:00.000
they would live
to see this day.

1466
01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Rabin:
Let me say to you.

1467
01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:43.000
we are destined
to live together.

1468
01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:47.000
on the same soil.
in the same land.

1469
01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:52.000
We. the soldiers
who have returned

1470
01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
stained with blood;

1471
01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:57.000
we. who have
come from a land

1472
01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:01.000
where parents
bury their children;

1473
01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:04.000
we. who have
fought against you.

1474
01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
the Palestinians.

1475
01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
we say to you today.

1476
01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:12.000
in a loud and a clear voice.

1477
01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:16.000
enough of blood and tears.

1478
01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:19.000
-Enough.

1479
01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
Mona:
"The Oslo channel

1480
01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:41.000
"began with the hopes
of creating a dialogue

1481
01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
"between adversaries.

1482
01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:49.000
"Already. this process
has succeeded

1483
01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:52.000
"beyond anything we imagined:

1484
01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:57.000
"The establishment
of a Palestinian state.

1485
01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
"Movement towards
a peace treaty

1486
01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
between Israel
and Jordan."

1487
01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:08.000
"And yet. undoubtedly.

1488
01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:11.000
objection to this process
is coming."

1489
01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:39.000
I am very shocked for this
awful and terrible crime...

1490
01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:45.000
against one of the brave
leaders of Israel.

1491
01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
And a peacemaker.

1492
01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Mona:
"For the efforts

1493
01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:21.000
"to bridge their hatreds
is always met by some

1494
01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
"with fierce resistance.

1495
01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:30.000
"But whatever
mistakes were made.

1496
01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:35.000
"whatever unintended events
have been unleashed.

1497
01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:39.000
"I still believe this channel
was worth doing.

1498
01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:47.000
"For if we do not sit
across from our enemies.

1499
01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
"and hear them.

1500
01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:52.000
"and see them
as human beings.

1501
01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
what will become of us?"
