(beeping)

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.474
(explosion)

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:28.166
(tires squealing)

00:01:39.962 --> 00:01:42.545
(wind blowing)

8
00:01:46.808 --> 00:01:49.390
(solemn music)

9
00:02:23.803 --> 00:02:28.440
- I never thought I'd have
to live without my husband

10
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.703
and now my daughter.

11
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.963
but I know You have a plan and a purpose.

12
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.013
God. I really need you right now.

13
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.240
- Tina. I'm sorry.

14
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.500
I didn't know you were gonna be here.

15
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.333
- No.

16
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.692
it's so good to see you.

17
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.250
I just got finished dropping
Joy off in Lancaster

18
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.143
with my brother and his family.

19
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.993
She needed to get away.

20
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.503
How are you?

21
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.053
I haven't seen you at church
or you haven't come by.

22
00:03:13.028 --> 00:03:14.528
- I'm okay.
- Yeah.

23
00:03:17.708 --> 00:03:19.458
- Yeah. I'm not okay.

24
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.740
It's just. losing my mom and then Rose.

25
00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:33.583
and now. just all the horrible
things that keep happening.

26
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.503
the explosion at the shipping
company and all the crime.

27
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.433
It just feels like too much.

28
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.393
- I understand.

29
00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.510
You know. if you ever
need anyone to talk to

30
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.460
or pray with you. you
know I'm here for you.

31
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.100
- Tina. I should be saying
that to you. but I just.

32
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.933
- No.

33
00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.480
- I'm sorry. I should go.

34
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.073
- No no. Amy. please stay.

35
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.623
I need to get home to Angie.

36
00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:08.879
(mournful music)

37
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.820
(crickets chirping)

38
00:04:13.862 --> 00:04:16.695
(traffic passing)

39
00:04:20.478 --> 00:04:23.311
(birds chirping)

40
00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:37.493
- Why?

41
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.963
I don't understand.

42
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.383
Why her?

43
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.913
I know you promised that
you'll always be with us.

44
00:04:57.238 --> 00:04:58.683
but I feel so alone.

45
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.520
and it still hurts so much.

46
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.913
And you. what were you thinking?

47
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.700
You were always the
leader. the strong one.

48
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.073
You always knew what
to do and what to say.

49
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.967
How could you let this happen?

50
00:05:35.715 --> 00:05:40.715
We were supposed to be each
others' maids of honor.

51
00:05:42.037 --> 00:05:43.560
We were supposed to run a homeschool co-op

52
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.243
like our parents did for us.

53
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.230
We were supposed to become
cranky old ladies and

54
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.510
sit on the porch. drinking
iced tea together.

55
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.113
I know you're in a better place.

56
00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.360
And I know we'll see each other again.

57
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.743
And I know God will get
me through this somehow.

58
00:06:38.864 --> 00:06:42.364
But I'm stuck here without my best friend.

59
00:06:43.448 --> 00:06:48.448
And I don't know what to do.

60
00:06:51.973 --> 00:06:54.003
I just feel so lost without you.

61
00:06:57.611 --> 00:06:59.778
(sobbing)

62
00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:28.559
(pensive piano music)

63
00:07:47.068 --> 00:07:48.818
- What is this stuff?

64
00:07:51.437 --> 00:07:54.513
- That's the girls' old
homeschooling curriculum.

65
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.570
Have you ever thought about
maybe going back to school

66
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:13.443
or college or even a trade school?

67
00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:18.090
- I was supposed to get a
scholarship in computer science.

68
00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:23.090
but then my parents died and
things kind of fell apart.

69
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.693
Besides. I've been on
the street for so long

70
00:08:27.693 --> 00:08:29.743
that I wouldn't even know where to start.

71
00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:33.299
- There's lots of ways
you can get back on track.

72
00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:34.133
if you want to.

73
00:08:35.157 --> 00:08:36.630
- I'm over 18. what am I supposed to do.

74
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.250
go back to 11th grade?

75
00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.890
- I homeschooled both girls.

76
00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:42.870
and you'd be surprised

77
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.690
how colleges and universities
and trade schools.

78
00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:48.150
they actively recruit homeschoolers.

79
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.163
You could go anywhere from there.

80
00:08:51.025 --> 00:08:53.864
(dogs barking)

81
00:08:53.864 --> 00:08:57.031
(pensive piano music)

82
00:09:07.366 --> 00:09:10.620
(phone ringing)

83
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.083
- Hi honey. how you doing?

84
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:14.883
- I'm fine. dad.

85
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:18.360
- Hey. I heard the Sheriff's department

86
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.520
got the budget for that
new mass spectrometer.

87
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.620
Have you had a chance to play with it yet?

88
00:09:23.594 --> 00:09:26.463
- No. I haven't been
down there in a while.

89
00:09:27.462 --> 00:09:29.883
You know. things have been slow there and.

90
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:31.913
- What honey?

91
00:09:32.832 --> 00:09:34.320
- Well. I've been thinking about

92
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.750
giving up my crime scene investigator job.

93
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:39.960
and just focusing on
my veterinary practice.

94
00:09:41.251 --> 00:09:44.334
- I understand. honey.
whatever you need to do.

95
00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:47.100
You know. I'm always here for you. right?

96
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:47.933
- I know dad.

97
00:09:50.222 --> 00:09:52.472
(beeping)

98
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:55.310
Sorry dad. I gotta go.

99
00:10:18.917 --> 00:10:19.750
Chelsea?

100
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:24.033
Chelsea?

101
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.370
- Show me your hands.

102
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:27.603
Police! Drop the gun.

103
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.160
- Show me your badge.

104
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.910
- You got some explaining to do.

105
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:40.530
- Excuse me?

106
00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:42.330
I'm Doctor Amy Bradford.

107
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.190
I'm the town crime scene investigator.

108
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:45.480
animal control officer.

109
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.710
and the local veterinarian.

110
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.893
This is my office. and
just who are you. exactly?

111
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.590
- I'm Detective Caleb Rodgers.

112
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.640
Just transferred into the town last week.

113
00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:00.273
Look. I'm sorry about that.
but well. what the heck.

114
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.840
- Is. is everything okay?

115
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.460
- Yes. everything's fine Chelsea.

116
00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.170
Did you lock the front door earlier?

117
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:08.130
- Yeah. of course.

118
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:11.833
I'm sorry. I was cleaning the
back with my headphones on.

119
00:11:11.833 --> 00:11:13.773
- So you didn't hear anybody
in here a few minutes ago?

120
00:11:13.773 --> 00:11:14.894
- No. no.

121
00:11:14.894 --> 00:11:16.110
Did did someone break in?

122
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.330
- Yeah. that's what we're
trying to figure out.

123
00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:19.200
- How's Oscar today?

124
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.033
- He's good.

125
00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:24.473
- Aw. hi. buddy.

126
00:11:25.709 --> 00:11:27.180
Hi.

127
00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:28.650
Chelsea's gonna take you back

128
00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:30.207
and give you a nice little snack

129
00:11:30.207 --> 00:11:32.533
and put you under your warm little lamp.

130
00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.560
Thanks Chelsea.

131
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:35.673
- Absolutely.

132
00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.480
- So. a reptile fan. huh?

133
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.040
- Yeah. I'm sure it
gives you a great big hug

134
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.290
right before it eats you.

135
00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:48.300
- Well. unless you feel the
need for extra protection.

136
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.683
can I have my gun back now?

137
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.840
- Walter PPK 380.

138
00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.313
The James Bond pistol.

139
00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:58.440
- Yep.

140
00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.020
Lightweight. good close range.

141
00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.760
My dad gave it to me as a present.

142
00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.040
It's a kind of a family inside joke.

143
00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.313
- Yeah. he must be a Bond
fan. into all that spy stuff.

144
00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:11.223
- Oh. you have no idea.

145
00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:14.490
- So what happened here?

146
00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:15.960
- Well. I have an app that alerts me

147
00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.000
if somebody's lingering outside.

148
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.280
The alert went off and there
was somebody in a black hoodie

149
00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.930
hanging outside the front door.

150
00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:23.580
- You didn't think to call the police?

151
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.800
- Well. sometimes people are dropping off

152
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.290
stray animals or pets they
can't take care of anymore.

153
00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:31.170
I don't want somebody like
that getting lights and sirens.

154
00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:33.000
And besides if somebody breaks in.

155
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.880
y'all get alerted anyway. obviously.

156
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.260
- Yeah. I'm not much on snakes.

157
00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.810
but anybody doesn't treat
their dog like family?

158
00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:41.410
Well. they ought to be arrested.

159
00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:45.900
- Rogers. on your six!

160
00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:47.820
We got here as fast as we could.

161
00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:51.303
- I was just talking to Miss.
I mean. Doctor Bradford.

162
00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.270
- Amy.

163
00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:55.103
- Elena.

164
00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.170
- Yeah. this room's pretty secure I think.

165
00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:00.780
Gonna go outside and
double check the perimeter.

166
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:01.950
- Copy that.

167
00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:03.390
- Thank you. Warren.

168
00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:04.680
- 10-4. doc.

169
00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.420
- Dispatch. there's nothing going on here.

170
00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:08.340
Everything's code four.

171
00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:09.173
- So.

172
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.690
Doctor Bradford here was
telling me what's going on.

173
00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:14.340
You were saying?

174
00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:16.440
- Yeah. so when I got here earlier.

175
00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.660
the front door was a jar when
it should have been locked.

176
00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.913
but nothing seems to be missing.

177
00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:25.230
- So I assume you keep
medications here for the animals.

178
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:26.910
tranquilizers. painkillers. and such.

179
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:27.930
You check those?

180
00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:29.507
- That was the first thing I thought of.

181
00:13:29.507 --> 00:13:31.740
I have a separate alarm
for the medicine cabinet.

182
00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.890
and it hasn't been touched.
so all the drugs are secure.

183
00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:35.723
- What's that?

184
00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:39.200
- Don't touch that.

185
00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:41.940
That is not mine.

186
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.190
which means somebody had
to have placed it here.

187
00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.890
So it's evidence and I
don't want it contaminated.

188
00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:47.723
- Excuse me?

189
00:13:47.723 --> 00:13:48.870
- No. no. she's right.

190
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:49.890
This is now a crime scene

191
00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:51.840
and she's the crime scene investigator.

192
00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.120
- Well. ordinarily. I'd say

193
00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.553
I'll take this back to my lab. but.

194
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:02.179
- We'll finish securing the place.

195
00:14:02.179 --> 00:14:03.810
and we'll have a car on standby.

196
00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:06.143
- Thank you. I'll let you
know when I have something.

197
00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:07.883
- Let's go.

198
00:14:13.695 --> 00:14:16.112
(soft music)

199
00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:29.553
- They found what?

200
00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:32.730
Well. how did it get there?

201
00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.687
Well. it sounds like we have a problem.

202
00:14:40.335 --> 00:14:41.753
You're just gonna have to fix it.

203
00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.140
All right. what's our status?

204
00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:47.760
- The project is moving according to plan.

205
00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.490
Their firewall is still holding but

206
00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:51.900
I'll take care of it.

207
00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:52.830
- All right.

208
00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:54.150
That's my girl.

209
00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:55.461
Keep me posted.

210
00:14:55.461 --> 00:15:00.461
- All right.

211
00:15:06.661 --> 00:15:09.161
(tense music)

212
00:15:27.759 --> 00:15:29.910
(phone ringing)

213
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:30.990
- Yeah. Lance.

214
00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:32.610
- Sorry to bother you at home Martin.

215
00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:34.110
but we have a situation.

216
00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:36.630
We need you back up on the mountain. ASAP.

217
00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:38.030
- Okay. I'll be right there.

218
00:15:44.877 --> 00:15:47.627
(phone ringing)

219
00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:50.640
- Amy. what's going on?

220
00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.470
I heard the police got
called to your office.

221
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:54.270
- I'm fine. dad.

222
00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:56.310
Apparently somebody broke in. but.

223
00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:58.200
but all the animals are fine.

224
00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.180
- Okay. glad to hear it.

225
00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:02.040
So it looks like they
sent that new detective.

226
00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.085
What's he like?

227
00:16:03.085 --> 00:16:05.430
- He's fine. Yeah.

228
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:06.600
A little quick to reach for his gun.

229
00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:10.650
and he didn't like Oscar. but
other than that. he's okay.

230
00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:13.290
- So anything juicy and exciting going on?

231
00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:16.140
- Seriously. dad. I just met the guy.

232
00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:17.640
I mean. okay.

233
00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:21.870
Yes. he is attractive. but I
don't know anything about him.

234
00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:23.100
Look. you know. I love you.

235
00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:24.360
but you need to back off this whole

236
00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.160
trying to marry me off thing. okay?

237
00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.840
Grandma is bad enough.

238
00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.990
and that's the last
thing I need right now.

239
00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:31.830
- Honey.

240
00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:33.630
I was asking about the crime scene.

241
00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.333
- Oh.

242
00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:38.373
right. yeah.

243
00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.850
So they didn't take anything.

244
00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:44.730
Apparently they just left something.

245
00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:46.350
a burnt metal box?

246
00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:48.373
I'm just getting ready to analyze it now.

247
00:16:48.373 --> 00:16:50.133
- A burnt metal box?

248
00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:53.760
Well. it sounds like you've
got a mystery to solve.

249
00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:56.823
- Yeah. we'll see.

250
00:16:58.260 --> 00:16:59.160
- Okay.

251
00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.570
I just got a call from Lance.

252
00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:03.660
and they need me up on
the mountain right away.

253
00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:04.492
- Okay.

254
00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:07.410
Well. I will talk to you later.

255
00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:08.849
I love you. Dad.

256
00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:09.683
- Love you too.

257
00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:20.492
- Martin. you need to see this.

258
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:23.970
- Whoa.

259
00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:26.849
- Hackers are constantly
trying to breach our system.

260
00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:28.530
but somebody's throwing something at us

261
00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:30.150
we've never seen before.

262
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:31.620
- How so?

263
00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.920
- Well they're using a
sophisticated mix of botnet armies

264
00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.320
that are constantly hunting
for vulnerabilities.

265
00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.060
while also sending through
large scale packets

266
00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:40.350
to install root kits.

267
00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:42.450
- Wow. that's a fresh one.

268
00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:43.710
Are we in trouble?

269
00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:45.570
- No. the team is all over it.

270
00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:47.370
The problem is we can't seem to find

271
00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:49.290
their center of command and control.

272
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:50.340
On the one hand.

273
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.100
it's like it's coming from
everywhere all at once.

274
00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.090
But.

275
00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:55.230
- But?

276
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:57.420
- Well. while this
attack is decentralized.

277
00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.820
we have been able to
locate the original source.

278
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.350
- And?

279
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:03.633
- It appears to be
coming from Stevens Mill.

280
00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:07.413
- Okay. let me make a call.

281
00:18:13.223 --> 00:18:16.530
(phone ringing)

282
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:17.820
- What's going on dad?

283
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.140
- Hi. honey.

284
00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.060
I need to ask you a question.

285
00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:22.080
- Okay.

286
00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.090
- So I know you haven't been to visit

287
00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:25.410
your friend Hector in a while.

288
00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:28.350
but is there any chance that
he might have gotten involved

289
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:31.053
in something sketchy?

290
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:34.080
- Not that I know of.

291
00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.340
Why?

292
00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:38.040
- Well. somebody's trying
to hack the facility.

293
00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.570
Now. that happens all the time.

294
00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:41.550
but this time the attacks

295
00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:44.280
are getting stronger and more frequent.

296
00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.743
- So. why are you asking about Hector?

297
00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.650
- Well. the people that are doing this

298
00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:51.870
are covering their tracks really well.

299
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:55.140
but we've been able to pinpoint
the source of the attacks

300
00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:57.570
and coming from Stevens Mill.

301
00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:01.350
and his nickname is Hector the Hacker.

302
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:02.183
- Dad.

303
00:19:02.183 --> 00:19:03.016
- Honey. I know he is your friend.

304
00:19:03.016 --> 00:19:05.250
that's why I'm calling you.

305
00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:07.230
If I launch an investigation from here.

306
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:10.470
it becomes official and I
don't want get him in trouble.

307
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:13.710
Is there any chance you
could just drop by his office

308
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:14.910
and see what he's up to?

309
00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.970
- Okay. I'll see what I can do.

310
00:19:21.665 --> 00:19:24.665
(soft. tense music)

311
00:19:40.345 --> 00:19:41.178
- Angie?

312
00:19:45.994 --> 00:19:46.827
- What?

313
00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.710
- What are you doing?

314
00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:50.697
- I'm playing my game.

315
00:19:50.697 --> 00:19:53.310
and I almost cracked to level 56.

316
00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:56.160
and now I have to start all over again.

317
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.660
- You've been spending a
lot of time on that game.

318
00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:03.390
- Yeah. well. back when my parents died.

319
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:04.380
me and my foster brother

320
00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.303
would play it together all the time.

321
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.233
It

322
00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:12.130
relaxes

323
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:16.425
me. (sighing)

324
00:20:16.425 --> 00:20:17.610
Ugh.

325
00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:20.880
- Well. I could really
use your help around here.

326
00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.190
- And I could really use some fresh air.

327
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:24.993
I'm gonna take Jethro for a walk.

328
00:20:27.634 --> 00:20:30.217
(gentle music)

329
00:20:31.154 --> 00:20:34.154
(Jethro whimpering)

330
00:20:39.741 --> 00:20:41.908
(sighing)

331
00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.430
(dramatic music)

332
00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:00.870
- Amy?

333
00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:02.963
Hey.

334
00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:06.420
It's good to see you again.

335
00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:07.253
- You too.

336
00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:13.113
Look. I'm sorry it's been so long.

337
00:21:13.113 --> 00:21:14.490
I just.

338
00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:15.323
- It's okay.

339
00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:17.993
I get it.

340
00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:20.393
- Thanks.

341
00:21:24.401 --> 00:21:25.743
Hmm.

342
00:21:25.743 --> 00:21:28.293
I like what you've done with the place.

343
00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:30.843
It's very you.

344
00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:33.203
- Thanks.

345
00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:39.560
After having Karl Corsault
walk in and almost shoot me.

346
00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:43.563
I decided it was time to
move and beef up security.

347
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.010
- Still no word on his whereabouts?

348
00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:48.630
- Karl?

349
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:49.463
Nada.

350
00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.200
Over six months since he killed Rex.

351
00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.670
and tried to kill us.

352
00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:56.070
and there's been no
activity on his credit card.

353
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:59.340
no ping on any of the
license plates he's used.

354
00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.470
Not even anything on facial recognition.

355
00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:04.013
It's like the earth just
opened up and swallowed him.

356
00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.550
Wait. do you think he could be the guy

357
00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:10.350
that broke into your office?

358
00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:12.593
- And left a clue without
disturbing anything?

359
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:15.030
That doesn't make sense.

360
00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:18.780
And how much does these days?

361
00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:22.080
- Well. I've run every online
check on Carl that I can.

362
00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.570
and everything seems completely legit.

363
00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:26.430
If he does have some sort of. you know.

364
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:28.680
secret connections that
we don't know about.

365
00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.840
he's hidden 'em pretty well.

366
00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:34.470
- What about his connection to
the Omni Millennium Company?

367
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:36.420
We know that he killed Rex McNear

368
00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:38.340
right after they talked
about some warehouse

369
00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:39.940
he thought Omni might wanna buy.

370
00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:42.270
- Yeah. I thought about that.

371
00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:43.980
but they're squeaky clean.

372
00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.450
at least as far as I can tell.

373
00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:47.550
- Yeah. but I had this feeling about them.

374
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:51.540
The explosion at Stevens
Mill Shipping Company

375
00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:54.510
conveniently gave them
an excuse to buy out

376
00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:56.010
the whole company for next to nothing

377
00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:58.860
from Rose and Jamie's dad.
and force him into retirement.

378
00:22:59.862 --> 00:23:01.110
- How are they doing. by the way?

379
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:02.730
- I talked to Jamie last week.

380
00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:05.730
he and Allie are settled in
South Carolina with his parents.

381
00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:08.580
It seems like they're all moving on.

382
00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.730
- Yeah. lot of that
going around right now.

383
00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.530
Seems like more and more businesses

384
00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:15.180
are closing up shop and moving out.

385
00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:16.950
now that the jobs are drying up.

386
00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:20.580
Omni continues to rake in
money from offshore imports.

387
00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:22.440
- There's gotta be
something we're missing.

388
00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.283
- Probably.

389
00:23:24.774 --> 00:23:27.870
But to be honest. I'm struggling
to stay afloat myself.

390
00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:31.200
Those businesses that are
closing up were my clients.

391
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.033
To be completely honest.

392
00:23:32.033 --> 00:23:34.080
I kind of need a little
bit more help around here.

393
00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.080
but that's not really something
I can afford right now.

394
00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:41.613
- So you're not doing anything.

395
00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:46.113
gray hat these days. are you?

396
00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:49.053
- No more than usual.

397
00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:51.450
Why?

398
00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:54.801
- Well. my dad said
that somebody from town

399
00:23:54.801 --> 00:23:56.370
keeps trying to hack into
the Mount Hideaway mainframe.

400
00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:58.980
- And naturally he assumed it was me.

401
00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:01.560
Typical government mentality.

402
00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.000
I'm sure it's probably
only gonna be a minute

403
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.430
before the storm troopers are
here. busting down my door.

404
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:07.110
hauling me off to a black site.

405
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:10.410
Well. let 'em come. bring him
on. I prefer a straight fight.

406
00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:12.390
- No. it's just the opposite.

407
00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:14.190
He asked me to check with you privately

408
00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:16.293
to avoid getting you in trouble.

409
00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:17.993
- Oh.

410
00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:22.500
Well that was very civilized of him.

411
00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:26.343
- So if it's not you.

412
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:30.990
- Then the only people left in the town

413
00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:33.720
with the resources to do
something like that would be.

414
00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:34.743
- Omni Millennium.

415
00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.030
- So what are we gonna do about it?

416
00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:40.943
- What do you mean?

417
00:24:40.943 --> 00:24:44.880
- I mean. you. and me.
investigating. solving crimes.

418
00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.180
just like how we did with-

419
00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:49.770
- Look. I'm sorry.

420
00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:50.603
I need to go.

421
00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:54.477
It was good to see you again.

422
00:25:07.815 --> 00:25:09.420
- What have you got for me?

423
00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:12.480
- I've increased the intensity
of the attack by 38%.

424
00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.390
We are hitting resistance.
but we expected that.

425
00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:17.520
Nothing you and I can't handle.

426
00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:18.420
- Awesome. all right.

427
00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:19.253
Keep at it.

428
00:25:20.215 --> 00:25:21.390
Ugh.

429
00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:23.070
As soon as we breach their security

430
00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:25.320
and steal a few critical files.

431
00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:26.670
the Joint Chiefs will have no choice

432
00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:29.610
but to shut them down and
give us the contract instead.

433
00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:31.560
- So in addition to buying the building

434
00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.210
for pennies on the dollar?

435
00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:35.700
- You will have all the bandwidth you need

436
00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.173
for our dark web activities.

437
00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:44.673
They'll get transferred from our town.

438
00:25:54.272 --> 00:25:56.939
(pensive music)

439
00:26:12.224 --> 00:26:14.724
(tense music)

440
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.640
- Well. this explains
why we haven't been able

441
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.083
to find Karl all this time.

442
00:26:47.588 --> 00:26:49.380
- You sure that's Karl Corsault?

443
00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.300
- Oh yeah. I'm sure all right.

444
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:52.860
I mean. I haven't had
time to run his prints.

445
00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:55.920
but I've seen him myself
wearing these clothes.

446
00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.360
- And who found the body?

447
00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.900
- Angie Darvishi. the girl that's
staying with Tina Shanholtz.

448
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:04.140
She was out walking the
dog and he dug this up.

449
00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:05.838
- You have a time of death.

450
00:27:05.838 --> 00:27:07.110
- Nothing conclusive. but it looks like

451
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:09.603
he's been in the ground
for several months.

452
00:27:09.603 --> 00:27:10.670
- So about the same time he was last seen

453
00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:12.810
at Hector Tech Computer Repair?

454
00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:15.660
He tried to kill Hector
Diaz and Bethany Shanholtz.

455
00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:17.880
- Yeah. probably not long after that.

456
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:20.790
- So you're saying that he was murdered

457
00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:23.880
right after threatening Bethany Shanholtz?

458
00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.103
And now he's found buried in her backyard.

459
00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.190
Nothing suspicious about that.

460
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:30.510
- You just wait a second. Elena.

461
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:32.710
- Now. we're not jumping
to any conclusions.

462
00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:36.910
What's the cause of death?

463
00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.440
- Well. nothing conclusive. but.

464
00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:46.110
well. this is just preliminary.

465
00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:48.150
but it looks like three
gunshots to the chest

466
00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:49.680
and one to the forehead.

467
00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.570
- So he was executed.

468
00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:55.440
like by some kind of an assassin or a spy?

469
00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.800
- Did you really think if
Bethany assassinated Carl.

470
00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.817
that should be dumb enough to
bury him in our own orchard?

471
00:28:00.817 --> 00:28:02.850
Look. are you gonna investigate this case

472
00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:04.950
or just let your sidekick
here make up stupid theories?

473
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:05.949
- Oh. excuse me.

474
00:28:05.949 --> 00:28:06.782
- Will you excuse me?

475
00:28:06.782 --> 00:28:08.056
I would not presume that a
town vet would know more-

476
00:28:08.056 --> 00:28:09.095
(talking over each other)

477
00:28:09.095 --> 00:28:10.347
- All right quiet. both of you.

478
00:28:16.078 --> 00:28:18.828
(sinister music)

479
00:28:34.169 --> 00:28:35.353
- Let go of me.

480
00:28:35.353 --> 00:28:37.290
I live here. I know my rights.

481
00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:39.528
- Angie. why were you hiding?

482
00:28:39.528 --> 00:28:40.570
- I wanna see what was going on.

483
00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:42.450
And I don't like cops.

484
00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:44.638
- So you're the one who found the body.

485
00:28:44.638 --> 00:28:46.413
- Yeah. it's just like Amy said.

486
00:28:47.688 --> 00:28:50.730
I was walking Jethro and he dug
up mister creepy over there.

487
00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:51.960
- Angie. you shouldn't be here.

488
00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:53.940
I'm taking you back to Tina.

489
00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.220
Y'all can take the body
back to the morgue.

490
00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:57.810
We'll talk more about this later.

491
00:28:57.810 --> 00:29:00.120
- Young lady. I'm gonna have some more

492
00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.770
questions for you later.

493
00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:05.257
- Torture me all you want.
Andy Griffith. I'll never talk.

494
00:29:05.257 --> 00:29:06.090
- Come on.

495
00:29:08.001 --> 00:29:10.418
(dark music)

496
00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:28.866
Come on.

497
00:29:28.866 --> 00:29:29.940
- I'm not a little kid anymore.

498
00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:30.773
I can help.

499
00:29:30.773 --> 00:29:31.980
- You have helped enough.

500
00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.000
- What's going on?

501
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.620
- I went up to the orchard
where she found Karl

502
00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:36.480
and I was trying to talk
to the new detective.

503
00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.904
- Who's totally hot by the way.

504
00:29:38.904 --> 00:29:40.317
- Hm.

505
00:29:40.317 --> 00:29:42.930
- And his sidekick. Elena Krazinska.

506
00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:44.220
- Oh.
- Yeah.

507
00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.830
Elena was trying to imply
that Bethany killed Karl.

508
00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:48.420
- She did what?

509
00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:50.370
- And I was trying to
explain to the detective

510
00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:51.750
what a stupid idea that was.

511
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:52.980
when he heard a noise and found Angie

512
00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:54.900
sneaking around and eavesdropping on us.

513
00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:55.893
- Angie.
- What?

514
00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:59.400
I was the one that Karl
tried to kill first.

515
00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.900
I was the one that found his body.

516
00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:02.520
If Amy can do it. so can I.

517
00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:03.570
- There's a difference.

518
00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:04.650
I'm a trained investigator.

519
00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:06.480
and I actually work for the police.

520
00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.743
- Okay girls. look.

521
00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:10.470
we've all been through a lot.

522
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:12.540
so we need to stick together.

523
00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:16.623
So let's just take a deep
breath and calm down.

524
00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:21.993
and let's go to the
table and ask for help.

525
00:30:26.239 --> 00:30:28.656
(soft music)

526
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:42.543
Heavenly Father.

527
00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:46.593
we just ask that you
would give us strength.

528
00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.120
We don't always understand

529
00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:53.220
why things happen the way that they do.

530
00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:57.513
And we know that in this life
we're gonna have difficulties.

531
00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.900
but you've promised us that you will

532
00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.783
never leave us or abandon us.

533
00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:08.140
and we just pray right now that you would

534
00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:12.270
help us to get along
and make good decisions.

535
00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:15.780
so that we can bring
honor and glory to you.

536
00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:18.753
and also honor the ones that we love.

537
00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:22.043
Amen.

538
00:31:22.043 --> 00:31:22.876
- Amen.

539
00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:29.200
You know. I had an idea
while you were praying.

540
00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:34.050
Angie. I might have a way for you to help

541
00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:36.060
and stay out of trouble.

542
00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.360
but I need to talk to
somebody about it first.

543
00:31:44.485 --> 00:31:47.902
(soft orchestral music)

544
00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:52.803
- About yesterday.

545
00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:55.673
I'm so sorry.

546
00:31:55.673 --> 00:31:59.043
- You didn't. it's fine I just.

547
00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:02.883
I can't go there right now.

548
00:32:02.883 --> 00:32:03.793
- Okay.

549
00:32:03.793 --> 00:32:04.643
I totally get it.

550
00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:11.943
So. what can I do for you right now?

551
00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:15.993
- Well. you know how you
said you needed some help.

552
00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:17.693
- Yes.

553
00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:21.810
- What about Angie?

554
00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:23.490
- No. no way.

555
00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:24.480
She is trouble.

556
00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.800
- She's super smart.

557
00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.840
and she was taking
advanced computer classes

558
00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:28.830
when she was still in school.

559
00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:30.210
- Yeah. Yeah.

560
00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:32.370
And she also has a
tendency of stealing things

561
00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:34.260
and running off.

562
00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:35.735
Sorry.

563
00:32:35.735 --> 00:32:37.050
I have way too much on my plate right now

564
00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:39.720
than also having to babysit
little miss sticky fingers.

565
00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:42.873
- But she could ease your workload and.

566
00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:45.470
you wouldn't have to pay her much.

567
00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.910
- Okay.

568
00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:51.743
Okay. fine.

569
00:32:51.743 --> 00:32:53.520
Fine. I'll give it a try.

570
00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:55.470
As long as she doesn't get
me into any more trouble

571
00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:56.520
than I'm already in.

572
00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.320
- I'm sure it'll be fine.

573
00:32:58.320 --> 00:32:59.970
I think she's learned her lesson.

574
00:33:03.585 --> 00:33:05.835
(mumbling)

575
00:33:10.658 --> 00:33:13.658
(doorbell ringing)

576
00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:18.690
- Miss Shanholtz?

577
00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:20.343
- I'm Tina Shanholtz.

578
00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:24.270
You must be Detective Rogers.

579
00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:25.260
- Yes. ma'am.

580
00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:26.220
I need to speak with Angie here.

581
00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:27.920
about how she discovered the body.

582
00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:29.993
- Come in.

583
00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:37.200
- Can we use this room?

584
00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.597
- I would like to be present
when you're questioning her.

585
00:33:39.597 --> 00:33:41.280
- Are you her parent or guardian?

586
00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:43.330
- Not officially. but she
does live here with me.

587
00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:44.757
- Well. I'm sorry. I'll have to ask you-

588
00:33:44.757 --> 00:33:48.690
- Or you can wait till
our attorney is present.

589
00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:50.460
- All right. fine.

590
00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:52.553
I'm gonna have some more
questions for you anyway.

591
00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:00.270
So Angie.

592
00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:02.550
why don't we start by you
telling me what you were doing

593
00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:03.690
in that section of the orchard

594
00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:05.190
you haven't been in for weeks.

595
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:08.310
- I needed some fresh air.
so I was out walking Jethro.

596
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:09.780
It's 300 acres.

597
00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:11.340
I mean. you could walk on different days

598
00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:14.370
and not see the same space for weeks.

599
00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:16.020
- And did you know Karl Corsault?

600
00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:16.853
- Know him?

601
00:34:16.853 --> 00:34:18.840
I mean. I knew that he was some guy

602
00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:22.260
that worked for the mayor up
until he tried to kill me.

603
00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.239
But then Bethany saved me.

604
00:34:24.239 --> 00:34:26.460
- That's Bethany Shanholtz?

605
00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.053
- Yes. my daughter.

606
00:34:28.889 --> 00:34:31.590
- Yes ma'am. sorry for your loss.

607
00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:34.770
I do understand that
there was some conflict

608
00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:36.210
between your daughter and Mister Corsault?

609
00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:39.810
- If by conflict. you mean
that he murdered two people

610
00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:41.699
and then went after my daughter?

611
00:34:41.699 --> 00:34:44.070
Yes. I would say there was conflict.

612
00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:45.719
- And you cops never found him.

613
00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:47.520
So of course Bethany had to go after him.

614
00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.170
- So you're saying she did go after him?

615
00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:50.429
- That's not what she meant.

616
00:34:50.429 --> 00:34:51.270
- Yes. it is.

617
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:52.440
- Miss Shanholtz. did your daughter

618
00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:56.159
have any official authority
to investigate anything?

619
00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:58.882
- She worked for the federal government.

620
00:34:58.882 --> 00:34:59.717
That's all I can say.

621
00:34:59.717 --> 00:35:02.160
- But if Bethany had killed Karl

622
00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:03.750
they'd never have found the body.

623
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:05.340
Duh. she was awesome.

624
00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:06.390
- Angie.

625
00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:08.850
- So how do you think the
body ended up in your orchard?

626
00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:12.090
- It's a large area
without a fence around it.

627
00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:13.770
It wouldn't have been difficult for anyone

628
00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:17.493
to drive onto the property
and dump the body there.

629
00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:21.030
- Okay.

630
00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:22.533
Well thank you for your time.

631
00:35:23.371 --> 00:35:26.171
and I'm sure I'll be in touch
later with more questions.

632
00:35:34.149 --> 00:35:35.220
- What was that?

633
00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:37.293
- What? That guy was an idiot.

634
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:40.440
Okay. hot idiot.

635
00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:41.850
but he was implying that Bethany

636
00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:44.190
was both crooked and stupid.

637
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:45.750
Somebody had to say something.

638
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:48.270
- I know. I didn't like it either.

639
00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:49.770
but the way that you answered him.

640
00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:51.822
didn't really help the situation.

641
00:35:51.822 --> 00:35:53.310
- I'm not like you. okay?

642
00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:55.440
I don't have a Bible quote for everything.

643
00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.003
and all the prayers and stuff.

644
00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.370
Everything's just getting worse.

645
00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:02.444
- I know this is hard and God never said

646
00:36:02.444 --> 00:36:03.960
that life would be easy.

647
00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:08.960
but he did promise that we
would not go through this alone.

648
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:11.340
- Well. maybe I wanna go through it alone.

649
00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:13.040
I always end up like that. anyway.

650
00:36:14.513 --> 00:36:18.430
(sentimental orchestral music)

651
00:36:22.207 --> 00:36:23.430
(phone ringing)

652
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:24.450
- Hi. Amy.

653
00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:26.310
- Tina. hey.

654
00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:27.720
So. about Angie.

655
00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:28.770
- Now what?

656
00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:30.240
- Tina.

657
00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:31.770
- I'm sorry.

658
00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:36.770
She has gotten on my last
nerve and I love her so much.

659
00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:40.050
but we really need a break.

660
00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:41.520
- Well. that's actually why I was calling.

661
00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.430
I talked to Hector and he
agreed to let Angie come

662
00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:45.870
and help at his computer shop.

663
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:47.340
So that gives her something to do.

664
00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:49.740
and you can have a little peace and quiet.

665
00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:52.503
- You know. that would be wonderful.

666
00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:56.010
Thank you. I will send her right over.

667
00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:58.080
- Okay. well. I guess I
will talk to you later.

668
00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.400
- Amy?

669
00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.630
One more thing.

670
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:01.620
- Yeah?

671
00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:02.910
- The detectives are implying

672
00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:06.360
that Bethany had something
to do with Carl's death.

673
00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.193
- Yeah. I know.

674
00:37:07.193 --> 00:37:09.000
- Well. you work with them. I mean.

675
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.790
you need to convince them
what a crazy idea this is.

676
00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:14.820
- Look. I don't even
know the new detective.

677
00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:17.040
and you know Elena's always
had it out for Bethany.

678
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:21.540
- Yes. but I mean. you
can still convince them.

679
00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:24.150
I mean. this is Bethany's
memory we're talking about.

680
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:26.000
- I'm sorry. Tina. I really gotta go.

681
00:37:27.513 --> 00:37:29.180
- Amy?

682
00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:43.950
- Well. I guess that explains

683
00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:45.840
why we haven't seen Karl in a while.

684
00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:48.270
- Yeah. but it opens up
so many more questions.

685
00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:49.563
- Yeah. it sure does.

686
00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.410
- What about the cyber
attack at Mount Hideaway?

687
00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:53.820
Do you think that's related?

688
00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:56.320
- It'd be hard to imagine
that it's a coincidence.

689
00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.060
- I like it.

690
00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:00.893
- I'm so glad.

691
00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:08.520
- Did you say that the
Mountain was getting hacked?

692
00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:10.260
- You weren't supposed to hear that?

693
00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:12.600
- Everybody always asks
me why I sneak around.

694
00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.360
How else am I supposed to know anything?

695
00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:18.030
If the Mountain's under attack
that definitely has to do

696
00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:19.380
with what we're dealing with.

697
00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:20.580
- Definitely.

698
00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:22.950
- Omni Millennium is taking over the town.

699
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:24.780
It's pushing out all the farmers.

700
00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:27.030
and all of the small businesses.

701
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:28.500
Do you really think that they want

702
00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:31.250
some military intelligence
looking over their shoulder?

703
00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:34.050
- She's actually got a point.

704
00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:34.883
- Okay.

705
00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:38.730
But if that is the case. what
are we gonna do about it?

706
00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:41.070
- I think it's time for
you and "Big Brother"

707
00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:43.590
to team up against a common enemy.

708
00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:46.320
- No. no way.

709
00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.910
The government already has enough control

710
00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:49.260
over our lives as is.

711
00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:52.530
Plus. if they knew half
of the stuff that I do.

712
00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:54.180
they'd be hauling me off to a black site

713
00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:55.013
in less than a minute.

714
00:38:55.013 --> 00:38:56.943
and I am allergic to waterboarding.

715
00:38:58.170 --> 00:38:59.760
- Plus Hector doesn't have clearance

716
00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:01.620
to know what's going on at Mount Hideaway.

717
00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:03.840
- Okay. let's talk about
Detective Sundance.

718
00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:04.673
- What about him?

719
00:39:04.673 --> 00:39:07.680
- Oh. he showed up around the
same time Karl went missing.

720
00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:09.060
Don't you think that's suspicious

721
00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:11.640
or convenient or something?

722
00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:14.970
- Well. with all the unsolved
crimes that happened.

723
00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:17.763
the last sheriff got
voted out pretty hard.

724
00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:21.520
This new guy. he said that he wants to

725
00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:26.670
clean house and provide a new perspective.

726
00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:27.630
- Exactly.

727
00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:29.460
So they bring in this guy.

728
00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:31.800
and then hire Barbie
Fife to be his sidekick.

729
00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:32.745
- [Hector] Who?

730
00:39:32.745 --> 00:39:34.245
- Elena Krazinska.

731
00:39:35.094 --> 00:39:38.010
- Oh man. I remember this story.

732
00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:39.543
- What? Spill the tea.

733
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:44.640
- Well. Elena was Bethany's
arch rival growing up.

734
00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:46.440
She went to the fancy private school.

735
00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:48.930
and she and Bethany both
did track and martial arts

736
00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:50.160
in the county leagues.

737
00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:51.513
Bethany was always better.

738
00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:54.600
One day during a karate tournament.

739
00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:56.790
Elena had tried an illegal
low kick on Bethany.

740
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:58.350
and Bethany blocked her with her elbow.

741
00:39:58.350 --> 00:40:01.473
and Elena was limping around for weeks.

742
00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:09.623
Sorry.

743
00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:15.150
Anyway. when Jamie and Bethany broke up.

744
00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:18.100
Elena came to college at Tech
where Jamie and I were going.

745
00:40:19.377 --> 00:40:21.960
And that's when it really got ugly.

746
00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:23.190
- What happened?

747
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:24.720
- Jamie was on the rebound from Bethany.

748
00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:28.923
and Elena swooped in
on her broom and sorry.

749
00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:31.260
Jamie and Elena dated.

750
00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:33.963
and she used him and broke his heart.

751
00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:36.390
I've always thought it
was just another way

752
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:37.830
to get it Bethany.

753
00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:39.513
- So what if they're both dirty?

754
00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:44.130
What if they're just Omni
shills trying to cover up

755
00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:45.900
by framing the good guys?

756
00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:46.950
- Yeah. Okay.

757
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:48.630
I'll look into it.

758
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:50.640
but some of those records
are gonna be tough to crack.

759
00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:51.690
even for me.

760
00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:53.520
- It really would be helpful
if you and my dad's people

761
00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:55.050
could work together on this.

762
00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:56.040
- I'm sorry. Amy.

763
00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:58.447
That's not gonna happen.

764
00:40:58.447 --> 00:41:01.230
- Okay. well you guys
can figure something out.

765
00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:02.843
I've gotta get back to my clinic.

766
00:41:04.437 --> 00:41:07.437
(soft piano music)

767
00:41:12.197 --> 00:41:13.030
- Come on.

768
00:41:19.274 --> 00:41:22.774
(light orchestral music)

769
00:41:23.942 --> 00:41:26.775
- Oh. it's okay. little guy.

770
00:41:26.775 --> 00:41:29.285
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

771
00:41:29.285 --> 00:41:33.490
I'm here to take care of you.

772
00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:35.072
Yeah. that's a joke.

773
00:41:35.072 --> 00:41:36.522
I can't take care of anybody.

774
00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:43.740
- [Tina] Amy? Hi.

775
00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:44.573
- Tina?

776
00:41:44.573 --> 00:41:45.960
Hey. what's going on?

777
00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.160
Are your animals okay?

778
00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:48.720
- Oh yes. they're fine.

779
00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:53.010
But there is something else
that I could use your help with.

780
00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:53.843
- What's that?

781
00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:59.580
- I know that it's been really hard

782
00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:01.263
since Bethany's accident.

783
00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:04.890
but Amy. that detective and Elena

784
00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:08.373
are trying to blame
Karl's murder on Bethany.

785
00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:10.653
I need your help.

786
00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:14.253
Bethany and I still need your help.

787
00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.560
- I'm sorry.

788
00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:17.730
I can't.

789
00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:18.563
- Why?

790
00:42:19.577 --> 00:42:21.180
- You don't understand.

791
00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:22.953
- Well then help me understand.

792
00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:24.813
Talk to me.

793
00:42:30.039 --> 00:42:30.872
- I.

794
00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:33.350
I should have been there.

795
00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.443
I wasn't there when
she needed me the most.

796
00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:39.870
- Oh sweetie.

797
00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:42.180
It was an accident.

798
00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:43.320
There is nothing that you could have.

799
00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:47.643
- I was supposed to be
with her. and I wasn't.

800
00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:52.980
If I had been then. maybe
she'd still be alive.

801
00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:54.780
- We don't know that.

802
00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:56.433
We don't even know what happened.

803
00:42:58.140 --> 00:42:59.853
We could have lost both of you.

804
00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:07.083
You can't blame yourself.

805
00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:15.270
but there is something that
you can do for her now.

806
00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:18.933
- What can I do?

807
00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:20.960
- What you love to do.

808
00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:25.200
You can find the clues
and solve the mystery.

809
00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:26.673
Somebody killed Karl.

810
00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:29.400
We have to figure out who did it.

811
00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:31.323
so we can clear Bethany's name.

812
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:34.803
- Well. we always did that together.

813
00:43:37.183 --> 00:43:38.880
I can't do that by myself. Tina.

814
00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.560
I don't even know where to start.

815
00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.330
- Well. there has to be a clue.

816
00:43:42.330 --> 00:43:44.283
or something that's out of place.

817
00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:47.733
Amy. you can do this.

818
00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:51.750
You've trained your whole life for this.

819
00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:52.830
and you won't be alone.

820
00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:56.013
You'll have me and your dad and Hector.

821
00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.430
Will you at least promise me
that you'll pray about it.

822
00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:09.683
Thank you.

823
00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:17.223
I almost forgot.

824
00:44:18.929 --> 00:44:20.673
I brought you this.

825
00:44:21.764 --> 00:44:23.520
It was Bethany's.

826
00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:26.523
She always loved to play
with her dad's compass.

827
00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:30.693
and he bought that for right
before his last deployment.

828
00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:36.003
She said that when she was feeling lost.

829
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:41.310
that it would remind her
to look to the only One

830
00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:43.113
that can truly show us the way.

831
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.288
Amy?

832
00:44:47.288 --> 00:44:52.288
Let Him guide you.

833
00:45:11.447 --> 00:45:12.870
- Well. I promised I'd pray about it

834
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:14.733
so I guess I have to.

835
00:45:18.187 --> 00:45:22.113
I want to help Tina and Bethany. but.

836
00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:25.023
I don't know how.

837
00:45:30.098 --> 00:45:31.681
I feel so lost and.

838
00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:35.823
and helpless.

839
00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:45.990
Well. there is a clue out there.

840
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:47.790
You're just gonna have to
put it right in front of me

841
00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:49.143
because otherwise I'm.

842
00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:55.890
Right in front of me.

843
00:45:57.474 --> 00:46:00.141
(pensive music)

844
00:46:01.487 --> 00:46:04.070
(upbeat music)

845
00:46:58.714 --> 00:47:00.540
(phone ringing)

846
00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:01.549
- Detective Rogers.

847
00:47:01.549 --> 00:47:03.090
- Detective. it's Amy Bradford.

848
00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:06.381
I've got some news about the
box that was left in my office.

849
00:47:06.381 --> 00:47:07.214
- What do you got?

850
00:47:07.214 --> 00:47:09.810
- The box was part of a very tiny IED.

851
00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:11.070
- A bomb?

852
00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:12.780
- Exactly.

853
00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:14.730
- Why would anybody
break into your office.

854
00:47:14.730 --> 00:47:16.530
leave fragments of an exploded bomb?

855
00:47:17.370 --> 00:47:19.800
Unless. unless it was
some kind of warning.

856
00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:22.140
- Well. if so. I don't feel very warned.

857
00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:25.114
No. I think there's
something else going on.

858
00:47:25.114 --> 00:47:26.850
- Well. I'll keep digging.

859
00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:28.061
- Oh. one more thing.

860
00:47:28.061 --> 00:47:30.780
In addition to the explosive
residue that I found on it.

861
00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:35.780
there was also traces of brake
fluid. motor oil and asphalt.

862
00:47:36.402 --> 00:47:39.180
- Yeah. so it was planted on a car.

863
00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:40.880
It was too small to blow a car up.

864
00:47:42.930 --> 00:47:44.640
Any ideas on that?

865
00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:47.240
- I just analyze the evidence.
you're the detective.

866
00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:51.300
And besides. oh my brain's so tired.

867
00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:54.120
I can hardly even think
straight right now.

868
00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:56.220
- All right. well that's understandable.

869
00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:58.290
We'll touch base tomorrow.

870
00:47:58.290 --> 00:47:59.403
- Okay. goodnight.

871
00:48:01.542 --> 00:48:04.292
(dramatic music)

872
00:48:18.330 --> 00:48:19.740
- Huh?

873
00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:21.180
Wowsers.

874
00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:22.183
- What's up?

875
00:48:22.183 --> 00:48:23.760
- I just got an official notice

876
00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:26.580
from Amy's dad at Mount Hideaway.

877
00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:28.590
They're offering me full immunity

878
00:48:28.590 --> 00:48:31.140
and a sweet paid consultant package

879
00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:33.240
if I work for them off the books.

880
00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:34.260
- Wow.

881
00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:35.093
- Yeah.

882
00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:38.393
Okay.

883
00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:43.860
- What's up?

884
00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:46.800
Hector Diaz just offered us his services.

885
00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:49.050
and sent over an electronically signed

886
00:48:49.050 --> 00:48:50.553
non-disclosure agreement.

887
00:48:54.604 --> 00:48:57.021
(soft music)

888
00:49:20.606 --> 00:49:22.773
(moaning)

889
00:49:29.017 --> 00:49:31.767
(dramatic music)

890
00:49:37.307 --> 00:49:39.000
(phone ringing)

891
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.370
- Hey Amy. I was just about to call you.

892
00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:43.740
- Hey. I need you to maybe
the police impound lot.

893
00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:45.390
- I beat you to it.

894
00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:46.560
- What?

895
00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:48.990
- Well. apparently we woke
up with the same idea.

896
00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:49.823
I got to thinking.

897
00:49:49.823 --> 00:49:52.650
why would anybody wanna blow
up just one part of a car?

898
00:49:52.650 --> 00:49:53.483
And then it hit me.

899
00:49:53.483 --> 00:49:56.460
So I came down here and it
turns out the impound lot

900
00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:58.860
was broken into the
same day as your office.

901
00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:00.270
Just no one noticed at the time.

902
00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:03.030
because almost nothing was
taken or disturbed except.

903
00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:04.350
- Bethany's car.

904
00:50:04.350 --> 00:50:06.000
- Yeah. or what's left of it.

905
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.430
So I looked it over and
a small bomb was used

906
00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:11.373
to blow out her brake line as
she was headed for the cliff.

907
00:50:11.373 --> 00:50:12.206
- What?

908
00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:14.733
- She was murdered.

909
00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:23.280
- It wasn't an accident.

910
00:50:24.223 --> 00:50:26.460
(dramatic music)

911
00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:27.293
- Amy?

912
00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:30.943
- Hey. I need to go.

913
00:50:31.863 --> 00:50:33.090
I'll talk to you later.

914
00:50:33.090 --> 00:50:34.953
Oh. thanks for looking into that.

915
00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:36.863
Bye.

916
00:50:37.819 --> 00:50:40.486
(pensive music)

917
00:50:58.579 --> 00:50:59.412
(phone ringing)

918
00:50:59.412 --> 00:51:01.320
- Hey Amy. what's going on?

919
00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:02.523
- It wasn't an accident.

920
00:51:04.110 --> 00:51:05.627
- What wasn't?

921
00:51:05.627 --> 00:51:07.127
- Bethany's death.

922
00:51:08.248 --> 00:51:09.081
She was.

923
00:51:11.598 --> 00:51:13.173
she was murdered.

924
00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:17.280
That box. it was.

925
00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:20.310
it was part of a bomb
and it was on her car.

926
00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:22.173
and I should have found it.

927
00:51:24.345 --> 00:51:27.630
I knew she was tired that day and I just.

928
00:51:27.630 --> 00:51:29.100
I assumed that she fell asleep

929
00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:31.413
or she swerved to miss an animal.

930
00:51:33.673 --> 00:51:36.457
but somebody killed her and.

931
00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:40.980
and the evidence was
right there for a month.

932
00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:42.870
and I didn't do anything about it.

933
00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:45.573
- Amy stop. take a deep breath.

934
00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:52.200
Honey. none of this was your fault.

935
00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:53.900
- I should have been doing my job.

936
00:51:57.305 --> 00:51:58.200
I let her down.

937
00:51:58.200 --> 00:51:59.970
- You haven't let her down.

938
00:51:59.970 --> 00:52:01.410
And you know Bethany wouldn't want you

939
00:52:01.410 --> 00:52:03.393
blaming yourself for any of this.

940
00:52:04.735 --> 00:52:05.730
If Bethany was murdered.

941
00:52:05.730 --> 00:52:07.650
we're gonna have to investigate.

942
00:52:07.650 --> 00:52:10.050
I'll call Lance and we'll
put a plan together.

943
00:52:10.050 --> 00:52:12.276
I'll let you know as much as we can.

944
00:52:12.276 --> 00:52:13.109
- Okay.

945
00:52:14.430 --> 00:52:15.990
I'll let you know what I find out as well.

946
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:17.280
- Amy?

947
00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:18.113
- Dad.

948
00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:22.920
- Okay. just promise me you'll be careful.

949
00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:25.053
Watch your back and keep me posted.

950
00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:27.143
- I will.

951
00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:30.261
- Honey. I've got another call coming in.

952
00:52:30.261 --> 00:52:32.734
Are you gonna be okay?

953
00:52:32.734 --> 00:52:34.484
- Yeah. I'll be okay.

954
00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:36.503
Bye. dad.

955
00:52:39.442 --> 00:52:41.859
(dark music)

956
00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:53.320
I'm gonna find whoever did this. Bethany.

957
00:52:57.690 --> 00:52:58.523
I promise.

958
00:53:04.767 --> 00:53:06.450
- Hey Hector.

959
00:53:06.450 --> 00:53:09.360
So you're sure you're okay with
the terms of our agreement?

960
00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:11.940
- Heck yeah. this is great. let's do it.

961
00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:14.100
- Okay. well there may be
some things that you can do

962
00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:16.020
because you're outside of our system.

963
00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:17.790
Maybe breach their air gap.

964
00:53:17.790 --> 00:53:18.623
- Sure.

965
00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:20.970
I got some other ideas too.

966
00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:27.060
- We're encountering some resistance?

967
00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:28.360
- Nothing we can't handle.

968
00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:30.903
- You got this.

969
00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:33.953
Let me know if we can do anything for you.

970
00:53:35.350 --> 00:53:36.183
- Okay.

971
00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:56.730
- So. you're telling me
someone planted a bomb

972
00:53:56.730 --> 00:53:59.550
on Bethany's front axle and blew it

973
00:53:59.550 --> 00:54:01.830
when she was heading for a cliff?

974
00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:02.663
- Yeah.

975
00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:07.713
Probably remote controlled.

976
00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:11.400
It looks like they also
weakened the guardrail.

977
00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:13.250
so it would give way when she hit it.

978
00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:17.610
I had a nice talk with Caleb.

979
00:54:17.610 --> 00:54:21.027
I'm starting to think maybe
he's not such a bad guy.

980
00:54:24.448 --> 00:54:25.281
What?

981
00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:31.740
- Well. given the fact that
everyone is moving out of town.

982
00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:34.743
I tend to get a little
suspicious when someone moves in.

983
00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:39.480
So I did a little digging
into Detective Roy Rogers.

984
00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:40.830
- What?

985
00:54:40.830 --> 00:54:43.590
- Turns out he left his last cop job

986
00:54:43.590 --> 00:54:47.523
under questionable
circumstances. and get this.

987
00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:53.570
the town he's from also has a
big Omni Millennium warehouse.

988
00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:57.690
and also has a large number

989
00:54:57.690 --> 00:55:01.923
of unsolved fires. explosions and murders.

990
00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:06.123
- Oh. maybe there's another explanation.

991
00:55:09.437 --> 00:55:10.687
- I don't know.

992
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:14.100
I wouldn't get too close
to him if I were you.

993
00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:16.440
For all we know. he's the
one who planted the bomb.

994
00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:18.960
and the only reason why he's
being honest with you right now

995
00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:20.493
is to cover his tracks.

996
00:55:22.302 --> 00:55:25.675
I don't know what would
happen if you got too close.

997
00:55:25.675 --> 00:55:27.925
- That's ridiculous.

998
00:55:27.925 --> 00:55:28.758
- I would've said the same thing

999
00:55:28.758 --> 00:55:30.690
if I hadn't seen his military record.

1000
00:55:30.690 --> 00:55:32.250
- Now what?

1001
00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:35.763
- He served in the Army. as a bomb expert.

1002
00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:39.120
- But that doesn't make any sense.

1003
00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:41.400
Why would he lead me to Bethany's murder

1004
00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:43.620
if he was the killer?

1005
00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:45.030
- I don't know.

1006
00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:46.710
Maybe he knew that you would figure it out

1007
00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:49.200
when you found the car
residue on the bomb.

1008
00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:51.480
and wanted to get ahead of you.

1009
00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:52.623
- I don't think so.

1010
00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:57.153
But at this point I'm
not taking any chances.

1011
00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:00.240
Well. if I can't go to Caleb for help.

1012
00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:03.570
then I guess I'm just
gonna have to go to Omni

1013
00:56:03.570 --> 00:56:05.130
and start digging on my own.

1014
00:56:05.130 --> 00:56:06.000
- How?

1015
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.980
- Sometimes the trucks that come through

1016
00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:10.350
Omni shipping port carry livestock.

1017
00:56:10.350 --> 00:56:13.860
I could use my position as a
vet and animal control officer

1018
00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:16.203
to make up an excuse to poke around.

1019
00:56:17.387 --> 00:56:20.793
- Are you sure you want to do that?

1020
00:56:20.793 --> 00:56:23.403
- Well. I don't really
see any other choice.

1021
00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:42.453
- Hey Angie. how was
your day at Hector Tech?

1022
00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:44.213
- It was fine.

1023
00:56:45.777 --> 00:56:47.043
- Are you hungry?

1024
00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:50.250
I made some of those
bacon biscuits you like.

1025
00:56:51.822 --> 00:56:52.655
- Ugh.

1026
00:57:04.554 --> 00:57:07.221
(ominous music)

1027
00:57:32.233 --> 00:57:34.983
(horse neighing)

1028
00:57:46.682 --> 00:57:49.099
(cow mooing)

1029
00:58:16.562 --> 00:58:19.895
(dark orchestral music)

1030
00:58:48.911 --> 00:58:51.661
(phone ringing)

1031
00:58:55.050 --> 00:58:56.013
- She is?

1032
00:58:58.140 --> 00:58:59.783
All right. thanks for letting me know.

1033
00:59:07.890 --> 00:59:11.523
Yeah. we've got a problem
with the veterinarian woman.

1034
00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:14.043
Yeah. do it.

1035
00:59:15.090 --> 00:59:17.163
And this time.

1036
00:59:18.089 --> 00:59:20.463
I want you to really leave a message.

1037
00:59:27.356 --> 00:59:31.023
(ominous orchestral music)

1038
00:59:33.469 --> 00:59:36.826
- Oh. I didn't hear you come in.

1039
00:59:36.826 --> 00:59:38.560
- You're assistant let me in.

1040
00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:41.670
- We've gotta stop meeting
like this. (laughing)

1041
00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:42.690
What's up?

1042
00:59:42.690 --> 00:59:44.940
- I wanted to talk to you a
little more about what you said

1043
00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:47.580
about a possible connection
between the death of

1044
00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:49.050
Karl Corsault and your friend Bethany.

1045
00:59:49.050 --> 00:59:50.580
- Okay. go ahead.

1046
00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:52.800
- So if Bethany was murdered.

1047
00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:55.282
chances are whoever
killed her. killed Karl

1048
00:59:55.282 --> 00:59:57.270
and wanted it to look
like she killed Karl.

1049
00:59:57.270 --> 00:59:58.770
- You know. I've been
thinking that this whole time.

1050
00:59:58.770 --> 01:00:01.050
So I decided to do some digging on my own.

1051
01:00:01.050 --> 01:00:03.180
I went up to Omni yesterday
to ask some questions.

1052
01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:04.170
And what I think is that-

1053
01:00:04.170 --> 01:00:05.160
- You did what?

1054
01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:07.800
- Yeah. so Hector found
evidence that Karl received

1055
01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:09.270
several phone calls from
inside their offices.

1056
01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:10.103
so I went up there.

1057
01:00:10.103 --> 01:00:10.950
- Amy. you shouldn't have gone there.

1058
01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:12.360
You should have come to me.

1059
01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.590
I'm the detective. remember?

1060
01:00:13.590 --> 01:00:14.790
- Well. then you should
have figured this out

1061
01:00:14.790 --> 01:00:15.660
before I had to.

1062
01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:16.890
Why are you getting so upset?

1063
01:00:16.890 --> 01:00:19.080
- Well. I figured that after
what happened to Bethany.

1064
01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:20.730
you and your friends
would've learned to stay away

1065
01:00:20.730 --> 01:00:22.200
from things you don't understand.

1066
01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.820
- Excuse me?

1067
01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:26.130
- Stay away from the
people at Omni Millennium.

1068
01:00:26.130 --> 01:00:28.860
- Why? Are you working for them?

1069
01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:33.420
- No. but I'm warning
you. don't go there again.

1070
01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:35.170
- Oh. so now you're threatening me.

1071
01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.243
- I need you to trust me.

1072
01:00:43.650 --> 01:00:47.250
- How can I trust you when
you won't tell me anything?

1073
01:00:47.250 --> 01:00:49.530
Like why you left your last job in a town

1074
01:00:49.530 --> 01:00:51.123
that Omni was taking over?

1075
01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:53.700
How do I know you're not one of them.

1076
01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:57.000
come to spy on us and do their dirty work?

1077
01:01:04.322 --> 01:01:06.905
(door closing)

1078
01:01:11.421 --> 01:01:14.921
(solemn orchestral music)

1079
01:02:03.512 --> 01:02:06.012
(tense music)

1080
01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:32.133
- Hey. Ames.

1081
01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:34.473
I really like your house.

1082
01:02:35.922 --> 01:02:40.140
It's really. it's you. and
I love your little kitty.

1083
01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:41.163
What's its name?

1084
01:02:44.490 --> 01:02:47.930
- Rose?
- Yeah.

1085
01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:48.930
- What are you?

1086
01:02:48.930 --> 01:02:51.120
How are. are you?

1087
01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:52.290
- Alive?

1088
01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:54.183
- Well. yeah.

1089
01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:57.690
- It's a long story.

1090
01:02:57.690 --> 01:02:59.793
Do you got any of that herbal iced tea?

1091
01:03:04.472 --> 01:03:07.139
(cattle mooing)

1092
01:03:11.245 --> 01:03:14.662
(acoustic guitar music)

1093
01:03:38.070 --> 01:03:39.150
- What the heck?

1094
01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:42.660
- I'm working and you're
sitting there playing this game.

1095
01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:44.130
I told you I needed your help.

1096
01:03:44.130 --> 01:03:46.620
- And I told you that I
would help after this level.

1097
01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:47.787
Why are you always harassing me?

1098
01:03:47.787 --> 01:03:49.620
You are such a pain.

1099
01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:52.350
If you're gonna live here.
you're gonna help out.

1100
01:03:52.350 --> 01:03:53.670
and show some respect.

1101
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:54.770
- You know what. Tina?

1102
01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:57.630
You're not my mom.

1103
01:03:57.630 --> 01:03:59.221
And you never will be.

1104
01:03:59.221 --> 01:04:00.360
And you know what else?

1105
01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:03.750
I'm tired of all these
prayers and these chores.

1106
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:04.593
I'm outta here.

1107
01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:13.020
- So you already know that my family

1108
01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:15.090
used to own Steven's Mill Shipping.

1109
01:04:15.090 --> 01:04:16.800
and then Omni Millennium came in.

1110
01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:21.570
wanting to invest in our
company and help the town grow.

1111
01:04:21.570 --> 01:04:22.403
- Okay.

1112
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.820
- They had an assistant. named Dax.

1113
01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:29.703
We were close.

1114
01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:32.063
- Okay.

1115
01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:38.630
- And you know Omni tried to
frame my dad for the explosion.

1116
01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:41.850
but you and Jamie

1117
01:04:41.850 --> 01:04:45.626
and Bethany stopped them.

1118
01:04:45.626 --> 01:04:47.276
- Yeah. and we almost got killed.

1119
01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:51.090
- What nobody knows is that Dax found out

1120
01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:53.460
what they were doing and told me.

1121
01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:55.360
We were coming to tell you guys

1122
01:04:56.250 --> 01:04:57.783
when they ran us off the road.

1123
01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:00.513
Dax died in the crash.

1124
01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:03.153
I just ran.

1125
01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:06.450
I let everybody believe that I was dead

1126
01:05:06.450 --> 01:05:08.150
so that Omni wouldn't kill me too.

1127
01:05:09.207 --> 01:05:10.110
- Rose. I'm so sorry.

1128
01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:11.850
I had no idea.

1129
01:05:11.850 --> 01:05:12.683
- I know.

1130
01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:17.883
Then Omni bought the business for nothing.

1131
01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:22.260
Since then. they've
been buying up the town.

1132
01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:23.310
driving everybody out.

1133
01:05:23.310 --> 01:05:25.773
and eliminating anyone
that gets in their way.

1134
01:05:26.976 --> 01:05:27.809
I know it sounds crazy.

1135
01:05:27.809 --> 01:05:30.360
but I really believe that
they have some big plan

1136
01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:33.573
to take over this whole area.

1137
01:05:34.650 --> 01:05:38.190
I also think they're trying
to shut down Mount Hideaway.

1138
01:05:38.190 --> 01:05:39.303
where your dad works.

1139
01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:45.720
It's hard trying to figure stuff out

1140
01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:47.283
when I can't show my face.

1141
01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:52.503
That's why I've been
leaving you guys the clues.

1142
01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:55.920
- What clues?

1143
01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:58.623
- Like the box I left at your office. duh.

1144
01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:01.980
By the way. can I have that
little gray chinchilla?

1145
01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:05.373
He was so cute. and I could
really use the company.

1146
01:06:06.990 --> 01:06:10.110
And then there was burying
Karl's nasty old carcass

1147
01:06:10.110 --> 01:06:13.500
in Bethany's orchard. but
that did not go how I planned.

1148
01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:15.510
- Wait. you did that?

1149
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:17.970
- Well. yeah.

1150
01:06:17.970 --> 01:06:20.427
I thought Bethany would find his body.

1151
01:06:20.427 --> 01:06:24.093
and that would lead you
guys to Omni. but no.

1152
01:06:26.053 --> 01:06:29.053
(knocking on door)

1153
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:34.950
- What are you doing here?

1154
01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:36.617
- Amy. we really need to talk.

1155
01:06:36.617 --> 01:06:38.160
- Now is really not a good time.

1156
01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:40.210
- Yeah well. I'm afraid I have to insist.

1157
01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:44.123
Please don't make this
harder than it needs to be.

1158
01:06:45.450 --> 01:06:46.293
- What is that?

1159
01:06:47.130 --> 01:06:49.280
- Last I checked. they
looked like flowers.

1160
01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:51.570
- I mean. what?

1161
01:06:51.570 --> 01:06:52.403
Why?

1162
01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:56.000
- I came to say. I'm sorry.

1163
01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.797
for the way I've been acting toward you.

1164
01:06:58.797 --> 01:07:00.390
You have to understand.

1165
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:03.900
when I came into town. I
didn't know who I could trust.

1166
01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:06.547
I'm from a beautiful
little town in Missouri.

1167
01:07:06.547 --> 01:07:09.465
A lot like this one. just like this one.

1168
01:07:09.465 --> 01:07:10.920
Omni Millennium moved in and soon after

1169
01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:12.370
bad things started happening.

1170
01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:16.051
- What kind of bad things?

1171
01:07:16.051 --> 01:07:18.180
- At first I couldn't put my finger on it.

1172
01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:21.810
There was more accidents
and suspicious fires

1173
01:07:21.810 --> 01:07:24.810
and weird unsolved
crimes than ever before.

1174
01:07:24.810 --> 01:07:28.140
and businesses started getting
vandalized. burned down.

1175
01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:29.620
- And you think Omni's behind it?

1176
01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:31.980
- I had my suspicions.

1177
01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:33.510
then I found out some of the other cops

1178
01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:35.010
were getting paid off
to look the other way

1179
01:07:35.010 --> 01:07:36.933
when certain crimes were taking place.

1180
01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:39.360
They asked me to join.

1181
01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:43.080
I refused. and then they set me up.

1182
01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:45.302
- Well. how'd you get out?

1183
01:07:45.302 --> 01:07:46.530
- Still had a few friends.

1184
01:07:46.530 --> 01:07:48.330
One of 'em tipped me off.

1185
01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:50.010
Really. the only choice
I had was to get out

1186
01:07:50.010 --> 01:07:51.270
while I still could.

1187
01:07:51.270 --> 01:07:55.110
but I hate running from a fight.

1188
01:07:55.110 --> 01:07:56.073
So I came here.

1189
01:07:56.970 --> 01:07:57.803
From what I can tell.

1190
01:07:57.803 --> 01:08:00.810
at least most of the Sheriff's
department's still clean.

1191
01:08:00.810 --> 01:08:02.550
I want to take down Omni.

1192
01:08:02.550 --> 01:08:05.370
before they wreck another
little town like they did mine.

1193
01:08:05.370 --> 01:08:07.113
- Well. if we're on the same side. then.

1194
01:08:07.113 --> 01:08:09.033
then why do you keep pushing me away?

1195
01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:11.640
- I haven't been discouraging you

1196
01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:13.590
because I don't believe in you.

1197
01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:15.660
I've been pushing you away
because I do believe you.

1198
01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:18.360
but you have to understand
these people are dangerous.

1199
01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:20.130
I don't want you to get hurt.

1200
01:08:20.130 --> 01:08:21.573
- I can take care of myself.

1201
01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:25.139
- Look. I didn't come to start
a fight with you. all right?

1202
01:08:25.139 --> 01:08:27.389
So please don't take this the wrong way.

1203
01:08:27.389 --> 01:08:29.889
but I'm sure Bethany thought
the exact same thing.

1204
01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:33.240
Whoever planted that shape
charge and Bethany's car

1205
01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:36.059
knew a lot about how to kill
somebody and get away with it.

1206
01:08:36.059 --> 01:08:38.340
If somebody hadn't put
that box in your office.

1207
01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:40.200
we'd have never figured it out.

1208
01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:42.270
We are talking about the
murder of somebody who.

1209
01:08:42.270 --> 01:08:45.210
from what I hear. was
a highly capable agent.

1210
01:08:45.210 --> 01:08:46.830
When I heard you walked
right into their office

1211
01:08:46.830 --> 01:08:48.750
and started asking questions.

1212
01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:49.952
I'm sorry I freaked out.

1213
01:08:51.899 --> 01:08:54.510
- I guess I did kind of stick
my head in the lion's mouth.

1214
01:08:54.510 --> 01:08:56.300
- Yeah. you kind of did.

1215
01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:57.569
You made it really hard for me

1216
01:08:57.569 --> 01:08:59.639
to do the digging that I need to do.

1217
01:08:59.639 --> 01:09:01.139
- I can't just sit around.

1218
01:09:01.139 --> 01:09:03.540
Bethany was my friend
and this is my hometown.

1219
01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:05.073
You should understand that.

1220
01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:07.660
- Think about it.

1221
01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:11.010
But for right now. I promise

1222
01:09:11.010 --> 01:09:13.530
I'll keep you updated
on anything I find out.

1223
01:09:13.530 --> 01:09:14.520
You do the same.

1224
01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:15.630
All right?

1225
01:09:15.630 --> 01:09:16.950
Please be careful.

1226
01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:17.819
Watch your back.

1227
01:09:17.819 --> 01:09:20.212
You can never tell when
somebody might be spying on you.

1228
01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:22.133
I would

1229
01:09:24.270 --> 01:09:29.270
hate it if anything bad happened to you?

1230
01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:32.073
- Bethany was always the leader.

1231
01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:34.950
She always knew what to do.

1232
01:09:37.834 --> 01:09:40.134
It's been hard being the
strong one by myself.

1233
01:09:42.719 --> 01:09:45.120
It feels nice to know
that somebody has my back.

1234
01:09:49.290 --> 01:09:51.960
- You don't have to carry
this by yourself anymore.

1235
01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:52.792
All right?

1236
01:09:54.752 --> 01:09:56.430
(crashing)

1237
01:09:56.430 --> 01:09:57.600
What was that?

1238
01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:01.110
- Oh. that was just my cat. you know.

1239
01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:03.513
probably knocking something
over like cats do.

1240
01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:09.532
- Well.

1241
01:10:12.389 --> 01:10:13.323
I should just go.

1242
01:10:14.610 --> 01:10:15.443
Yeah.

1243
01:10:19.290 --> 01:10:20.850
- Thanks for the flowers.

1244
01:10:20.850 --> 01:10:21.683
- [Caleb] Yeah.

1245
01:10:23.414 --> 01:10:25.996
(door closing)

1246
01:10:28.170 --> 01:10:29.003
- Meow.

1247
01:10:39.675 --> 01:10:40.980
- So I guess you heard all that.

1248
01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:42.719
- I sure did.

1249
01:10:42.719 --> 01:10:43.870
- So what do you think?

1250
01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:46.380
- I think that guy's a keeper.

1251
01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:47.910
Are you going after him?

1252
01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:50.520
- No. I'm not going after him.

1253
01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:51.510
- Then can I have him?

1254
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:53.040
- No!

1255
01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:53.873
I mean.

1256
01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:57.719
besides you're supposed to be dead.

1257
01:10:57.719 --> 01:10:59.520
- Oh yeah. right.

1258
01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:01.559
- Okay. so you were just about to tell me

1259
01:11:01.559 --> 01:11:04.200
why you put Karl's body
in Bethany's orchard.

1260
01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:08.160
- So I've been tracking Omni.
pretty much how Caleb has.

1261
01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:11.969
And Karl was their fixer.

1262
01:11:11.969 --> 01:11:14.160
He used his position in the mayor's office

1263
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:18.093
to steer local political
decisions in Omni's favor.

1264
01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:21.420
But when you guys found that video of him

1265
01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:25.680
murdering Rex McNear.
Carl became a liability.

1266
01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:27.809
- So did you see him get killed?

1267
01:11:27.809 --> 01:11:28.980
- No.

1268
01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:33.330
I saw him get in the
van. and I saw a flash.

1269
01:11:33.330 --> 01:11:35.130
When the killers got out of the van.

1270
01:11:35.969 --> 01:11:40.969
I stole it and Karl and took
him to Bethany's orchard

1271
01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:44.913
where I thought she
would find him. but no.

1272
01:11:47.309 --> 01:11:51.930
- Okay well. I'll talk
to Hector and my dad.

1273
01:11:51.930 --> 01:11:53.880
and Tina will be so happy.

1274
01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:57.300
- No. Amy. if Omni finds out I'm alive.

1275
01:11:57.300 --> 01:11:59.610
then I won't be for long.

1276
01:11:59.610 --> 01:12:01.380
- Okay. so I won't tell my dad.

1277
01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:03.930
because then he'd have to
tell the government people.

1278
01:12:03.930 --> 01:12:05.940
but we can trust Hector.

1279
01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:06.773
- Okay.

1280
01:12:08.219 --> 01:12:09.510
I'll contact you in a day or two.

1281
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:11.733
It's best that you don't know where I am.

1282
01:12:18.719 --> 01:12:20.820
- I've been living on my own for years.

1283
01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:23.280
and now I just feel like a caged animal.

1284
01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:24.750
And now I'm living on a farm.

1285
01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:27.809
and there's all this mud
and this dirt and stuff.

1286
01:12:27.809 --> 01:12:31.710
And the cows. the cows are terrifying.

1287
01:12:31.710 --> 01:12:35.100
And it's. it's just like.
it's like. oh. hey Amy.

1288
01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:37.469
It's like. they watch you wherever you go.

1289
01:12:37.469 --> 01:12:40.500
- Angie. I need to talk
to Hector for a minute.

1290
01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:41.450
- Give me a second.

1291
01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:45.263
(creepy music)

1292
01:12:59.219 --> 01:13:03.059
And Tina. I know that she means well.

1293
01:13:03.059 --> 01:13:06.420
but she has all these
rules and all these chores.

1294
01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:08.550
And she has me reading these devotionals.

1295
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:10.650
And there's this one
about this girl named Ruth

1296
01:13:10.650 --> 01:13:13.320
and her mother-in-law. like
why would I wanna read that?

1297
01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:15.240
- Hey Angie. I've got an idea.

1298
01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:17.130
Why don't you go get us some Chinese food.

1299
01:13:17.130 --> 01:13:18.600
- On my bike?

1300
01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:20.340
Why can't we just order pizza?

1301
01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:22.623
- I really don't feel like pizza.

1302
01:13:24.150 --> 01:13:27.120
I'll tell you what. you
can take my convertible.

1303
01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:28.800
Here's some money.

1304
01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.690
Just keep the change for making the trip.

1305
01:13:30.690 --> 01:13:33.330
- Really. you're convertible?

1306
01:13:33.330 --> 01:13:34.889
- Yeah.

1307
01:13:34.889 --> 01:13:36.300
But the thing is you have to go right now

1308
01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:38.160
because I am starving.

1309
01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:39.652
Right Hector? Aren't you hungry?

1310
01:13:39.652 --> 01:13:41.235
- Yeah. yeah. sure.

1311
01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:44.280
- Yeah. just get us the usual.

1312
01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:45.150
- Great.

1313
01:13:45.150 --> 01:13:46.139
And by the way.

1314
01:13:46.139 --> 01:13:48.330
I know that this is just
ploy to get me a leave.

1315
01:13:48.330 --> 01:13:51.147
so that you and Hector can
talk about grown up stuff.

1316
01:13:51.147 --> 01:13:52.597
but I'm just rolling with it.

1317
01:13:54.270 --> 01:13:55.103
See ya.

1318
01:14:02.142 --> 01:14:03.573
- Ugh.

1319
01:14:03.573 --> 01:14:05.400
- Wow. the poor kid.

1320
01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:06.840
- I know. but listen.

1321
01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:09.660
Okay. so I have some news
about the case and well.

1322
01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:11.860
everything and you are
not gonna believe it.

1323
01:14:23.436 --> 01:14:25.686
(click. beeping)

1324
01:14:30.344 --> 01:14:31.500
So I went home a little while ago

1325
01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:33.600
and my front door was open.

1326
01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:34.743
So I went in.

1327
01:14:34.743 --> 01:14:37.911
(phone ringing)

1328
01:14:37.911 --> 01:14:38.823
Oh. now what?

1329
01:14:40.110 --> 01:14:43.590
Hi Angie. are you having
trouble getting the car started?

1330
01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:44.790
Sometimes you just need to jiggle

1331
01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:46.643
the gear shift and turn the. what?

1332
01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:51.873
- What. wait. hey. hey. what?

1333
01:14:52.710 --> 01:14:53.543
Wait.

1334
01:14:56.362 --> 01:14:59.112
- I sat down and I heard a click.

1335
01:15:01.170 --> 01:15:03.120
- Okay Angie. I need you to listen to me

1336
01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:04.744
very carefully. okay?

1337
01:15:04.744 --> 01:15:07.952
I need you to stay calm and
don't lean forward at all.

1338
01:15:08.910 --> 01:15:10.500
It's gonna be okay. we're gonna get help.

1339
01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:11.333
- From who?

1340
01:15:12.272 --> 01:15:13.559
- Well. I only know of one bomb expert.

1341
01:15:13.559 --> 01:15:14.490
- Do you think we can trust him?

1342
01:15:14.490 --> 01:15:16.200
- Yes I do.

1343
01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:17.790
And besides what choice do we have?

1344
01:15:17.790 --> 01:15:20.087
You go call him. I'm gonna stay here.

1345
01:15:21.549 --> 01:15:23.522
It's gonna be okay. all right?

1346
01:15:23.522 --> 01:15:25.272
We're gonna get help.

1347
01:15:29.302 --> 01:15:31.719
(dark music)

1348
01:15:40.269 --> 01:15:41.992
(phone ringing)

1349
01:15:41.992 --> 01:15:42.992
- Hey. Ange.

1350
01:15:46.312 --> 01:15:47.632
Okay. hang on.

1351
01:15:47.632 --> 01:15:50.103
And I'm gonna be right there.

1352
01:15:50.103 --> 01:15:52.853
(siren blaring)

1353
01:16:05.282 --> 01:16:07.334
- Hey Angie. how you doing?

1354
01:16:07.334 --> 01:16:09.382
- I've been better.

1355
01:16:09.382 --> 01:16:11.610
- It's like you ended up in
that hot seat after all. huh?

1356
01:16:11.610 --> 01:16:12.600
Let's take a look.

1357
01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:15.452
- You do know how to disarm this. right?

1358
01:16:16.547 --> 01:16:18.090
- I'm the best bomb expert around. so.

1359
01:16:18.090 --> 01:16:20.790
- You're the only bomb expert around.

1360
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:22.590
But I guess you haven't been blown up yet.

1361
01:16:22.590 --> 01:16:23.740
so that's a good thing.

1362
01:16:27.528 --> 01:16:28.695
- Hey sweetie.

1363
01:16:30.630 --> 01:16:33.397
- Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

1364
01:16:33.397 --> 01:16:34.814
- I'm getting in.

1365
01:16:37.397 --> 01:16:38.897
- Now get in easy.

1366
01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:47.130
- What are you doing?

1367
01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:54.750
- Remember when I told you.

1368
01:16:56.520 --> 01:17:00.213
that when bad things happen.
you never have to be alone.

1369
01:17:02.670 --> 01:17:04.053
- Why are you doing this?

1370
01:17:07.235 --> 01:17:09.318
- Because this is exactly

1371
01:17:10.503 --> 01:17:12.063
what God did for me.

1372
01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:17.612
and you and I are gonna
get through this together.

1373
01:17:19.559 --> 01:17:20.393
And if not.

1374
01:17:22.230 --> 01:17:23.133
I'm ready.

1375
01:17:23.969 --> 01:17:27.213
I'm ready to see my husband and Bethany.

1376
01:17:28.770 --> 01:17:29.763
and be with you.

1377
01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:36.003
- Can I help?

1378
01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:38.580
- You can help me by
getting to a safe distance.

1379
01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:39.960
I've already got both of their lives

1380
01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:42.059
hanging on the edge with just
a few minutes on the clock.

1381
01:17:42.059 --> 01:17:44.580
and I don't need to be
worried about you right now.

1382
01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:45.930
- I'm not worried. I believe in you.

1383
01:17:45.930 --> 01:17:46.797
- That is not the point.

1384
01:17:46.797 --> 01:17:48.120
- I'm not leaving.

1385
01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:49.350
- Amy.

1386
01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:50.950
- The clock's ticking detective.

1387
01:17:56.451 --> 01:17:58.951
(tense music)

1388
01:18:44.589 --> 01:18:46.803
- Hey. you got this.

1389
01:18:48.180 --> 01:18:50.530
- Amy. I've never seen
a bomb like this before.

1390
01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:57.483
Lord. please my hands right now.

1391
01:19:00.936 --> 01:19:03.237
We've got a lot of work left here to do.

1392
01:19:03.237 --> 01:19:05.313
And the devil wants to end us right now.

1393
01:19:08.219 --> 01:19:10.143
I know the victory is already Yours.

1394
01:19:13.380 --> 01:19:14.733
but if it's our time to go.

1395
01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:17.610
then I guess we'll be with You shortly.

1396
01:19:24.059 --> 01:19:24.993
But in all things.

1397
01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:27.623
Thy

1398
01:19:28.705 --> 01:19:30.175
will

1399
01:19:30.175 --> 01:19:31.009
be...

1400
01:19:34.306 --> 01:19:38.806
Done! (clipping)
(gasping)

1401
01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:52.923
- Oh Angie. I'm so sorry.

1402
01:19:54.570 --> 01:19:57.421
- Next time you want pizza.
let's get it delivered. okay?

1403
01:19:57.421 --> 01:19:58.254
- Okay.

1404
01:20:00.270 --> 01:20:01.623
- I can't thank you enough.

1405
01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:04.230
- God gets all the glory. ma'am.

1406
01:20:04.230 --> 01:20:05.130
My training never taught me

1407
01:20:05.130 --> 01:20:07.410
what to do with a bomb like that.

1408
01:20:07.410 --> 01:20:08.820
Thank you for your prayers.

1409
01:20:08.820 --> 01:20:12.180
- I'm gonna keep praying until
we find out who did this.

1410
01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:14.100
And by the way.

1411
01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:17.219
I used to be an intelligence
analyst at Mount Hideaway.

1412
01:20:17.219 --> 01:20:20.250
If you need anything. you let me know.

1413
01:20:20.250 --> 01:20:21.083
- Yes. ma'am.

1414
01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:23.093
- Detective?

1415
01:20:24.510 --> 01:20:25.563
Take care of her.

1416
01:20:36.847 --> 01:20:40.847
- Yeah. I'm gonna go check
the security footage.

1417
01:20:45.967 --> 01:20:48.600
- I've never prayed so hard in my life.

1418
01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:49.433
- Me neither.

1419
01:20:50.610 --> 01:20:51.443
That bomb.

1420
01:20:52.350 --> 01:20:54.473
- You said you've never
seen one like it before?

1421
01:20:55.541 --> 01:20:56.375
- No.

1422
01:21:03.570 --> 01:21:06.030
- So this bomb and the
one under Bethany's car

1423
01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:09.603
had the exact same signature.
but they were different.

1424
01:21:11.010 --> 01:21:15.513
The one under Bethany's car
was surgical and stealthy.

1425
01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:18.362
This one was deliberately overbuilt.

1426
01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:22.770
They wanted you to sit
against the pressure plate.

1427
01:21:22.770 --> 01:21:25.170
spend your last minutes
hearing that timer tick.

1428
01:21:26.670 --> 01:21:28.420
They wanted him to make you suffer.

1429
01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:33.570
Amy. this was personal.

1430
01:21:33.570 --> 01:21:35.270
All right. you have to be careful.

1431
01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:41.040
- Well. God made sure you were here today

1432
01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:42.480
to keep us safe so.

1433
01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:44.910
I guess He's not done with me yet.

1434
01:21:44.910 --> 01:21:46.503
And I promise I'll be careful.

1435
01:21:47.430 --> 01:21:50.880
- Hey. so I checked the security footage.

1436
01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:53.700
and whoever planted the bomb

1437
01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:54.960
wore a hat and kept their hood up.

1438
01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:57.960
so I can't tell what
their face looked like.

1439
01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:01.050
And it's impossible to tell
if it's a man or a woman.

1440
01:22:01.050 --> 01:22:02.610
Oh wait. it gets better.

1441
01:22:02.610 --> 01:22:04.559
I think they parked around the
corner away from any cameras

1442
01:22:04.559 --> 01:22:08.070
because I don't have any video
of a car to pull the plates.

1443
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:09.570
- Gimme a copy of
whatever footage you have.

1444
01:22:09.570 --> 01:22:10.403
- Yeah. yeah.

1445
01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:13.469
- Thanks man.

1446
01:22:13.469 --> 01:22:14.303
- Yeah.

1447
01:22:17.370 --> 01:22:18.963
You did a good job today. Tex.

1448
01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:23.010
Looks like you're pretty useful

1449
01:22:23.010 --> 01:22:24.510
to have around here. actually.

1450
01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:28.263
- Okay. I can take you home.

1451
01:22:29.190 --> 01:22:31.290
so I can make sure your
house is clean. huh?

1452
01:22:31.290 --> 01:22:32.123
- Yeah.

1453
01:22:35.610 --> 01:22:36.610
I'll get your stuff.

1454
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:39.900
- Wait. Amy.

1455
01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:42.150
wasn't there something you
were supposed to tell me?

1456
01:22:42.150 --> 01:22:45.106
- Oh yes. oh my goodness.

1457
01:22:45.106 --> 01:22:47.181
Hector. Rose is alive.

1458
01:22:47.181 --> 01:22:48.350
- What?

1459
01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:50.340
- She came to my house.

1460
01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:51.690
She said she wants to help.

1461
01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:55.200
I'll call and tell you
all the details later.

1462
01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:56.910
- You're just gonna drop
a bomb on me like that.

1463
01:22:56.910 --> 01:22:59.130
ooh. that was a poor choice of words.

1464
01:22:59.130 --> 01:23:01.050
and then you're just
gonna leave me hanging?

1465
01:23:01.050 --> 01:23:02.253
- I'll call you.

1466
01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:18.630
- Amy. I really don't like
leaving you here by yourself.

1467
01:23:18.630 --> 01:23:20.309
- I have state of the art security system

1468
01:23:20.309 --> 01:23:22.380
and plenty of ammo. I'll be fine.

1469
01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:23.820
- Well. if you feel the
least bit uncomfortable.

1470
01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:24.753
you call me. okay?

1471
01:23:25.848 --> 01:23:27.389
(phone notification)

1472
01:23:27.389 --> 01:23:29.070
- Yeah. Yeah.

1473
01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:30.123
I will. I promise.

1474
01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:35.933
So.

1475
01:23:38.910 --> 01:23:40.260
- Yeah. I should.

1476
01:23:40.260 --> 01:23:42.000
I should go.

1477
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:42.933
- Thanks again.

1478
01:23:45.210 --> 01:23:46.043
Bye.

1479
01:23:47.896 --> 01:23:50.478
(dog barking)

1480
01:23:55.290 --> 01:23:57.032
- Hector. I said I would call you.

1481
01:23:58.620 --> 01:24:00.032
Okay. here's the deal.

1482
01:24:01.074 --> 01:24:04.824
(uplifting orchestral music)

1483
01:24:38.576 --> 01:24:43.576
(doorbell ringing)
(knocking on door)

1484
01:24:58.144 --> 01:24:58.977
Hey grandma.

1485
01:24:58.977 --> 01:25:01.701
- Hi sweetie. how are you?

1486
01:25:01.701 --> 01:25:02.698
- I'm good.

1487
01:25:02.698 --> 01:25:03.781
- Good. good.

1488
01:25:06.150 --> 01:25:08.610
I heard what happened
and I just had to come

1489
01:25:08.610 --> 01:25:10.980
and make sure that you're okay.

1490
01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:12.180
- I'm fine.

1491
01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:13.650
- Oh. good.

1492
01:25:13.650 --> 01:25:17.010
Well. why don't you make us some tea

1493
01:25:17.010 --> 01:25:18.260
and tell me all about it.

1494
01:25:31.710 --> 01:25:35.627
Amy. your jobs involve
animals and dead bodies.

1495
01:25:38.370 --> 01:25:41.910
Why would someone plant
a bomb in your car?

1496
01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:44.370
- Grandma. you know I
can't talk about my cases.

1497
01:25:44.370 --> 01:25:49.370
Well. I just had no idea
it was so dangerous.

1498
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:55.112
I think it's high time you
settled down and got married.

1499
01:25:56.010 --> 01:25:56.969
- I'll get married when God

1500
01:25:56.969 --> 01:25:58.320
brings the right guy into my life.

1501
01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:00.123
- Of course you will.

1502
01:26:01.050 --> 01:26:04.053
But tell me about this
new detective fellow.

1503
01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:07.473
He's the town hero now.

1504
01:26:08.730 --> 01:26:12.990
He sounds like a really special young man.

1505
01:26:12.990 --> 01:26:16.139
- He's nice. but I barely know him.

1506
01:26:16.139 --> 01:26:18.120
- Barely know him?

1507
01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:20.697
He saved your life today.

1508
01:26:20.697 --> 01:26:22.952
and I hear he's quite handsome.

1509
01:26:26.504 --> 01:26:27.743
- I'll fix us some more tea.

1510
01:26:40.633 --> 01:26:43.550

1536
01:27:49.576 --> 01:27:51.146
Is there someone else in there?

1537
01:27:51.146 --> 01:27:52.056
- What?

1538
01:27:52.056 --> 01:27:52.889
No.

I'm just tired of these big flies

1546

that keep getting in my house.

1547
01:28:50.010 --> 01:28:51.210
- Amy.

1548
01:28:51.210 --> 01:28:54.270
I wish you didn't have
to be in this big house

1549
01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:56.580

Dad made sure I had the
best security system.

1553
01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:05.250

that will check on me.

No. I just. I just sing for fun.

Well. you should sing a
duet together sometime.

1591
01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:41.730
She plays the piano too.

1592
01:30:41.730 --> 01:30:45.003

01:31:00.300 --> 01:31:02.264
- Oh. thanks you. ma'am.

1600
01:31:02.264 --> 01:31:05.337
(phone ringing)

1601
01:31:05.337 --> 01:31:06.389
- Oh. it's dad.

1602
01:31:06.389 --> 01:31:07.223
Excuse me.

1603
01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:12.648
- Hey honey. I was just
checking to see how you doing?

1604
01:31:12.648 --> 01:31:14.040
(sighing)

1605
01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:15.300
What's wrong now?

1606
01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:16.440
- Oh. nothing.

1607
01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:18.930
Just Caleb and grandma
having a cozy little chat

1608
01:31:18.930 --> 01:31:19.930
over tea and scones.

1609
01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:22.230
- Oh boy.

1610
01:31:22.230 --> 01:31:24.120
Has she pulled out your baby pictures yet?

1611
01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:26.161
- Oh no. she'd better not.

1612
01:31:26.161 --> 01:31:27.630
She's already embarrassing me to no end.

1613
01:31:27.630 --> 01:31:30.840
and she's gonna start planning
my wedding any second.

1614
01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:33.210
- Oh. I'm sure it's not that bad.

1615
01:31:33.210 --> 01:31:35.550
Hey. I had our people sweep your car

1616
01:31:35.550 --> 01:31:37.020
and it's all clean and safe.

1617
01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:39.570
I'm gonna have the team drop
it by your house tonight.

1618
01:31:39.570 --> 01:31:41.422
and check your neighborhood.

1619
01:31:41.422 --> 01:31:42.780
So if you're not too busy

1620
01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:45.420
picking out silverware patterns tomorrow.

1621
01:31:45.420 --> 01:31:48.540
can you get all the troops
together at eight o'clock

1622
01:31:48.540 --> 01:31:49.710
for a meeting at Hector Tech?

1623
01:31:49.710 --> 01:31:50.543
- Yeah. sure.

1624
01:31:50.543 --> 01:31:52.080
- And bring Caleb along.

1625
01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:53.400
If he's gonna marry my daughter.

1626
01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:55.500
I've gotta show him my
gun collection first.

1627
01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:56.610
- Dad.

1628
01:31:56.610 --> 01:31:58.559
- Sorry. I couldn't resist.

1629
01:31:58.559 --> 01:32:00.063
But anyway. bring him along.

1630
01:32:00.999 --> 01:32:02.398
- If I don't kill him first.

1631
01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:07.740
Now you take good care of her.

1632
01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:08.573
- Yes. ma'am.

1633
01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:15.183
Your grandma's nice.

1634
01:32:18.389 --> 01:32:20.093
- I will never hear the end of this.

1635
01:32:25.097 --> 01:32:28.776

- Come on. rise and shine. cowboy.

1646
01:33:17.580 --> 01:33:18.413
Time to go.

1647
01:33:21.773 --> 01:33:22.782
- Go where?

1648
01:33:22.782 --> 01:33:23.615
- A meeting at Hector Tech.

1649
01:33:23.615 --> 01:33:24.448
Let's go.

1650
01:33:31.170 --> 01:33:32.639
- What's going on?

1651
01:33:32.639 --> 01:33:34.200
- You'll find out.

1652
01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:35.760
- You still mad about yesterday?

1653
01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:36.930
- Come on.

1654
01:33:36.930 --> 01:33:37.930
- I saved your life.

1655
01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:44.280
What is going on?

1656
01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:46.383
- Welcome to the posse. Tex.

1657
01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:51.093
- Angie.

1658
01:33:52.487 --> 01:33:54.066
- Angie.

1659
01:33:54.066 --> 01:33:54.898
Angie?

1660
01:33:56.005 --> 01:33:56.838
Angie. honey.

1661
01:33:59.460 --> 01:34:00.293
Detective.

1662
01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:06.303
- Miss Shanholtz.

1663
01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:10.230
- Well. I've seen your file.

1664
01:34:10.230 --> 01:34:12.010
You're supposed to be dead.

1665
01:34:12.010 --> 01:34:13.413
- Yeah. I get that a lot.

1666
01:34:16.980 --> 01:34:18.960
- All right folks. up here for a minute.

1667
01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:21.210
So up until now. we've all
had a piece of the puzzle.

1668
01:34:21.210 --> 01:34:23.610
but we've been keeping
our cards to ourselves.

1669
01:34:23.610 --> 01:34:25.053
- You just mixed metaphors.

1670
01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:28.559
Thought I should point that out. you know.

1671
01:34:30.030 --> 01:34:31.950
- Okay dad. why don't you get us started?

1672
01:34:31.950 --> 01:34:33.450
- Thanks Amy.

1673
01:34:33.450 --> 01:34:35.010
For those of you who don't know me.

1674
01:34:35.010 --> 01:34:38.010
I am Deputy Director.
Doctor Martin Bradford.

1675
01:34:38.010 --> 01:34:41.340
the Chief of Staff of the
Mount Hideaway facility.

1676
01:34:41.340 --> 01:34:44.969
This is Colonel Lance Piper.
who runs the facility.

1677
01:34:44.969 --> 01:34:46.950
Lance. why don't you get the ball rolling?

1678
01:34:46.950 --> 01:34:47.782
- Thanks. Martin.

1679
01:34:47.782 --> 01:34:50.639
We've had our eyes on Omni
Millennium for a long time.

1680
01:34:50.639 --> 01:34:52.860
We've suspected them of
everything from arms dealing

1681
01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:54.090
to human trafficking.

1682
01:34:54.090 --> 01:34:55.889
but we've never been able to make a case.

1683
01:34:55.889 --> 01:34:59.340
- Their tactic is to move into
small communities like ours

1684
01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:00.750
and take over.

1685
01:35:00.750 --> 01:35:03.900
It's always a town in a rural location

1686
01:35:03.900 --> 01:35:06.300
with a major shipping hub.

1687
01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:08.550
- In addition to a
litany of arson. murder.

1688
01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:09.990
and other crimes.

1689
01:35:09.990 --> 01:35:11.400
they've been working the political trail

1690
01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:13.110
on Capitol Hill for years.

1691
01:35:13.110 --> 01:35:15.780
trying to get the Mount
Hideaway facility shut down.

1692
01:35:15.780 --> 01:35:16.680
- If you guys moved out.

1693
01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:19.620
they'd have access to a high
bandwidth computer facility.

1694
01:35:19.620 --> 01:35:21.719
and a ready-made server farm.

1695
01:35:21.719 --> 01:35:23.250
They'd be just as dangerous
in the cyber world

1696
01:35:23.250 --> 01:35:24.870
as they already are IRL.

1697
01:35:24.870 --> 01:35:26.580
- Over the years. we've
worked with a number of folks

1698
01:35:26.580 --> 01:35:28.710
doing all kinds of different things.

1699
01:35:28.710 --> 01:35:30.719
but we haven't been able to
give anybody the big picture

1700
01:35:30.719 --> 01:35:33.240
about what was going on
for security purposes.

1701
01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:35.340
The situation has become critical.

1702
01:35:35.340 --> 01:35:38.730
With the loss of Agent Shanholtz. Bethany.

1703
01:35:38.730 --> 01:35:40.680
and the cyber attacks on the facility.

1704
01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:43.920
Martin and I thought it best
to bring everybody together.

1705
01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:46.260
- Okay. let's start at the beginning.

1706
01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:49.530
I'm going to ask Rose to go first.

1707
01:35:49.530 --> 01:35:52.620
because you've been
investigating this case

1708
01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:56.639
longer than any of us. haven't you. Rose?

1709
01:35:56.639 --> 01:35:58.710
- Wait. what?

1710
01:35:58.710 --> 01:36:00.780
You already knew I was alive?

1711
01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:02.969
- You popped up on our surveillance photos

1712
01:36:02.969 --> 01:36:04.469
about three years ago.

1713
01:36:04.469 --> 01:36:06.660
and I've been doing my
best to support you.

1714
01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:10.559
without blowing your cover. or mine.

1715
01:36:10.559 --> 01:36:12.180
- Dad. what the heck?

1716
01:36:12.180 --> 01:36:13.733
You knew she was alive this whole time?

1717
01:36:13.733 --> 01:36:15.300
You are the one that's been helping her

1718
01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:17.190
and you didn't tell me?

1719
01:36:17.190 --> 01:36:19.050
- Honey. you and I both know

1720
01:36:19.050 --> 01:36:20.850
that if I'd read you in on this.

1721
01:36:20.850 --> 01:36:24.660
you would have insisted on
going directly after them.

1722
01:36:24.660 --> 01:36:25.862
and it wasn't time yet.

1723
01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:28.110
- All right. fine.

1724
01:36:28.110 --> 01:36:30.460
But when we get home.
we're having a long talk.

1725
01:36:32.790 --> 01:36:35.460
Go ahead. Rose. sorry guys.

1726
01:36:35.460 --> 01:36:36.540
- Eight years ago.

1727
01:36:36.540 --> 01:36:38.610
Omni bought our family business

1728
01:36:38.610 --> 01:36:42.510
after blowing up our warehouse.
and framing my dad for it.

1729
01:36:42.510 --> 01:36:44.969
- That was the explosion
that killed my parents.

1730
01:36:44.969 --> 01:36:47.219
Rose's uncle. and countless others.

1731
01:36:47.219 --> 01:36:50.639
- They killed my boyfriend.
Dax. and almost killed me.

1732
01:36:50.639 --> 01:36:52.473
So I faked my death.

1733
01:36:53.430 --> 01:36:55.650
I've been working undercover ever since.

1734
01:36:55.650 --> 01:36:57.270
mostly in other towns.

1735
01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:59.520
trying to gather evidence against them.

1736
01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:01.920
- They've had a number of
managers over the years.

1737
01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:04.590
but a few weeks ago. Errol Gunderson.

1738
01:37:04.590 --> 01:37:08.100
the head of the whole Omni
operation. moved into town.

1739
01:37:08.100 --> 01:37:11.250
It looks like he's here
to oversee something big.

1740
01:37:11.250 --> 01:37:15.870
We may have a unique
opportunity to take them down.

1741
01:37:15.870 --> 01:37:17.490
- Look. excuse me. sir.

1742
01:37:17.490 --> 01:37:18.480
I know I'm the new guy.

1743
01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:21.030
but I have to ask. is what
we're doing here even legal?

1744
01:37:21.030 --> 01:37:22.590
- I appreciate the question.

1745
01:37:22.590 --> 01:37:24.570
The agency in charge of the operations

1746
01:37:24.570 --> 01:37:28.020
at the Mount Hideaway facility.
doesn't operate on US soil.

1747
01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:30.420
Instead. we've been working
in cooperation with.

1748
01:37:30.420 --> 01:37:33.930
- Other three-letter agencies.

1749
01:37:33.930 --> 01:37:35.790
- Other three letter agencies to make sure

1750
01:37:35.790 --> 01:37:38.250
what we're doing is legal
and above the board.

1751
01:37:38.250 --> 01:37:40.250
- Why don't you tell us your story. son?

1752
01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:42.960
- Yes. sir.

1753
01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:44.068
Well. like I told Amy here.

1754
01:37:44.068 --> 01:37:45.690
I'm from a small town in Missouri.

1755
01:37:45.690 --> 01:37:47.670
where pretty much the same thing went on.

1756
01:37:47.670 --> 01:37:48.840
I was a homicide detective.

1757
01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:50.430
and I basically got run out of town.

1758
01:37:50.430 --> 01:37:52.020
because I wouldn't get on Omni's payroll

1759
01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:53.880
and look the other way when
they started killing people

1760
01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:56.340
and running businesses out of the county.

1761
01:37:56.340 --> 01:37:57.300
- We were picking up chatter

1762
01:37:57.300 --> 01:37:59.130
that they were onto something pretty big.

1763
01:37:59.130 --> 01:38:01.710
Bethany Shanholtz was
undercover in the investigation.

1764
01:38:01.710 --> 01:38:03.240
but she got too close.

1765
01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:04.559
She was killed by an explosive

1766
01:38:04.559 --> 01:38:06.030
that made her car run off the road.

1767
01:38:06.030 --> 01:38:08.100
- Yeah. well most
bombers have a signature.

1768
01:38:08.100 --> 01:38:10.200
and I'd be willing to bet
that whoever made that device

1769
01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:12.200
also made the one we found in Amy's car.

1770
01:38:14.670 --> 01:38:16.980
- Which is why we're here.

1771
01:38:16.980 --> 01:38:20.163
to come up with a plan
and take back our town.

1772
01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:24.240
Dad. Colonel Piper. and Hector.

1773
01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:26.550
are working on counter
measures to the hack.

1774
01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:29.370
Tina used to be an intelligence
officer at Mount Hideaway.

1775
01:38:29.370 --> 01:38:31.440
and Dad's reinstated
her security clearance.

1776
01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:33.330
so she'll be coordinating
all the information.

1777
01:38:33.330 --> 01:38:34.893
anything we find goes to her.

1778
01:38:35.790 --> 01:38:39.930
Caleb. Rose. and I. will figure
out a way to get into Omni

1779
01:38:39.930 --> 01:38:42.990
and find the evidence we
need to take them down.

1780
01:38:42.990 --> 01:38:45.840
- I'm sorry y'all. I can't do
that without a search warrant.

1781
01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:47.460
- If the police force is compromised.

1782
01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:48.870
they'll know you're coming.

1783
01:38:48.870 --> 01:38:50.160
- I understand that. sir.

1784
01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:52.500
But if we're gonna do this.
we're gonna do it by the book.

1785
01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:53.333
- All right. son.

1786
01:38:53.333 --> 01:38:54.210
Fair enough.

1787
01:38:54.210 --> 01:38:56.889
But let me go directly to
the judge for the warrant.

1788
01:38:56.889 --> 01:38:58.973
- All right. get to work.

1789
01:39:00.553 --> 01:39:04.303
(dramatic orchestral music)

1790
01:39:58.380 --> 01:40:00.090
- All right. well.

1791
01:40:00.090 --> 01:40:05.090
it seems like they're utilizing
a ton of computing power.

1792
01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:08.430
but it's way more than they
have in that building. so.

1793
01:40:08.430 --> 01:40:11.250
- Oh. there's something we're missing.

1794
01:40:11.250 --> 01:40:12.243
I need a break.

1795
01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:23.558
- Angie. stop playing the game.

1796
01:40:23.558 --> 01:40:25.163
- What? Not you. too.

1797
01:40:25.163 --> 01:40:26.413
- Just stop for a second.

1798
01:40:30.389 --> 01:40:32.040
When you started to play the game.

1799
01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:34.530
there was an infinitesimal increase

1800
01:40:34.530 --> 01:40:36.270
in the intensity of the hack.

1801
01:40:36.270 --> 01:40:39.870
The difference was tiny.
but it was definitely there.

1802
01:40:39.870 --> 01:40:43.860
- Wait so. how many people
are actually playing this game

1803
01:40:43.860 --> 01:40:45.210
at any given time?

1804
01:40:45.210 --> 01:40:47.010
- Well. a couple of days ago.

1805
01:40:47.010 --> 01:40:50.820
they changed their paid
subscription plan to being all free.

1806
01:40:50.820 --> 01:40:53.130
I mean. it was a big thing
even in the video game world.

1807
01:40:53.130 --> 01:40:58.130
So. the amount of active
users at any given time

1808
01:40:58.410 --> 01:41:00.873
is like tens of millions?

1809
01:41:02.550 --> 01:41:03.603
- It's the game.

1810
01:41:04.650 --> 01:41:06.150
They built a back door into the game.

1811
01:41:06.150 --> 01:41:08.130
and people are unknowingly lending

1812
01:41:08.130 --> 01:41:12.180
their device's computing
power to fuel the attack.

1813
01:41:12.180 --> 01:41:16.800
I mean. millions of
people's phones and tablets

1814
01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:19.050
are all powering the
attack on Mount Hideaway

1815
01:41:19.050 --> 01:41:21.318
from all over the world.

1816
01:41:21.318 --> 01:41:23.490
(chuckling)

1817
01:41:23.490 --> 01:41:26.013
- Miss Shanholtz. call the gang back in.

1818
01:41:27.510 --> 01:41:29.233
I think we have a plan.

1819
01:41:30.210 --> 01:41:31.410
- All right. listen up everybody.

1820
01:41:31.410 --> 01:41:33.540
It's time to take back our town.

1821
01:41:33.540 --> 01:41:35.070
Tina walk us through it.

1822
01:41:35.070 --> 01:41:38.550
- Okay. so with some help from
our three-letter agencies.

1823
01:41:38.550 --> 01:41:40.680
we have determined that Gunderson

1824
01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:43.602
is gonna set up his
headquarters at Steven's Mill.

1825
01:41:43.602 --> 01:41:44.670
- But why here?

1826
01:41:44.670 --> 01:41:47.430
- Because of the Mount Hideaway complex.

1827
01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:49.500
If they're able to get the
government to shut it down.

1828
01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:51.330
they can swoop in and buy the building

1829
01:41:51.330 --> 01:41:54.059
with all of its high speed
network infrastructure

1830
01:41:54.059 --> 01:41:55.410
for next to nothing.

1831
01:41:55.410 --> 01:41:56.850
- They'd be as dangerous on the dark web

1832
01:41:56.850 --> 01:41:59.309
as they are now with smuggling
and arms trafficking.

1833
01:41:59.309 --> 01:42:01.020
- We can't just assault the building.

1834
01:42:01.020 --> 01:42:02.940
because we don't have enough evidence.

1835
01:42:02.940 --> 01:42:06.120
but we do have warrants to go in quietly.

1836
01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:08.370
Ordinarily we'd use government operatives.

1837
01:42:08.370 --> 01:42:10.860
but we don't know who's on Omni's payroll.

1838
01:42:10.860 --> 01:42:14.493
Right now. the only people we
can trust are in this meeting.

1839
01:42:15.450 --> 01:42:17.280
- The cyber team at Mount Hideaway.

1840
01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:18.630
they already have their hands full

1841
01:42:18.630 --> 01:42:20.010
trying to fend off this attack.

1842
01:42:20.010 --> 01:42:23.340
So Amy. Caleb. and Rose.

1843
01:42:23.340 --> 01:42:25.469
you're gonna break into the Omni building.

1844
01:42:25.469 --> 01:42:28.139
and try to ward off the
attack from the inside.

1845
01:42:28.139 --> 01:42:31.532
and hopefully find some evidence
that can shut Omni down.

1846
01:42:32.370 --> 01:42:34.230
Angie and Hector.

1847
01:42:34.230 --> 01:42:36.580
you gotta get people to
stop playing that game.

1848
01:42:38.616 --> 01:42:41.116
(tense music)

1849
01:43:19.139 --> 01:43:20.910
- Drop the device.

1850
01:43:20.910 --> 01:43:21.743
- No problem.

1851
01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:23.993
You're too late. anyway.

1852
01:43:23.993 --> 01:43:25.740
The hack's almost complete.

1853
01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:28.770
Besides. you're not leaving.

1854
01:43:28.770 --> 01:43:29.603
- Why not?

1855
01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:35.820
- Did you really think that
you could just sneak in here

1856
01:43:35.820 --> 01:43:37.112
without us noticing?

1857
01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:39.150
- Elena?

1858
01:43:39.150 --> 01:43:40.350
- Howdy. partner.

1859
01:43:40.350 --> 01:43:41.943
- Oh. I might have known.

1860
01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:45.273
- Kick 'em to us please.

1861
01:43:47.610 --> 01:43:50.190
- Well. I guess while
you were trespassing.

1862
01:43:50.190 --> 01:43:52.260
you're gonna have a little accident.

1863
01:43:52.260 --> 01:43:53.093
Whoops.

1864
01:43:53.093 --> 01:43:54.480
- Yeah. we've got a warrant.

1865
01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:56.520
All right. the government's on to you.

1866
01:43:56.520 --> 01:43:59.670
- Well. in 20 minutes
we're gonna break through

1867
01:43:59.670 --> 01:44:03.809
Mount Hideaways firewall and
plunder all of their data.

1868
01:44:03.809 --> 01:44:06.873
So the leaders are gonna get discredited.

1869
01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:10.110
The local police are in my back pocket.

1870
01:44:10.110 --> 01:44:12.600
So I'm pretty sure that
no one's gonna know

1871
01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:13.949
that you're gone.

1872
01:44:13.949 --> 01:44:15.630
- All right.

1873
01:44:15.630 --> 01:44:17.969
All of you in the storage room.

1874
01:44:17.969 --> 01:44:20.013
cell phones on a table. please.

1875
01:44:23.317 --> 01:44:24.150
Great.

1876
01:44:25.026 --> 01:44:26.460
- I'll be back for each
and every one of you.

1877
01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:28.743
once this cyber attack is complete.

1878
01:44:30.420 --> 01:44:32.763
Oh. you too. sweetie.

1879
01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:36.660
You see your job here is done.

1880
01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:39.150
and now you're just a loose end.

1881
01:44:39.150 --> 01:44:41.460
- No. tell her. Errol.

1882
01:44:41.460 --> 01:44:44.190
- Actually Elena's right.

1883
01:44:44.190 --> 01:44:47.610
Sorry. you're kind of
a loose end right now.

1884
01:44:47.610 --> 01:44:48.443
Oops.

1885
01:44:48.443 --> 01:44:50.436
- No. I did all of this for you.

1886
01:44:50.436 --> 01:44:53.580
- Oh. and I really. really.
really appreciate it.

1887
01:44:53.580 --> 01:44:54.873
Like seriously.

1888
01:44:56.490 --> 01:44:58.080
Make sure you clean up the mess.

1889
01:44:58.080 --> 01:44:59.219
- Sure boss.

1890
01:44:59.219 --> 01:45:01.112
Sorry. love story's over.

1891
01:45:02.430 --> 01:45:05.373
Everyone in the storage room. now.

1892
01:45:07.510 --> 01:45:08.985
Move. move.

1893
01:45:08.985 --> 01:45:11.485
(tense music)

1894
01:45:25.020 --> 01:45:27.600
- All right. they have our
cell phones and our guns.

1895
01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:30.243
Is there any other way
we can call for help?

1896
01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:39.233
- Really?

1897
01:45:39.233 --> 01:45:42.030
Is now the best time you're
playing that stupid game?

1898
01:45:42.030 --> 01:45:44.490
- My game is connected to the
building's wireless network

1899
01:45:44.490 --> 01:45:46.110
and it has a chat feature.

1900
01:45:46.110 --> 01:45:48.450
I just need to figure
out who can help us out.

1901
01:45:48.450 --> 01:45:49.440
- Here.

1902
01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:50.273
Give it to me.

1903
01:45:51.407 --> 01:45:52.808
- Come on. come on. come on.

1904
01:45:54.510 --> 01:45:55.620
- Hey.
- Huh?

1905
01:45:55.620 --> 01:45:58.350
- It's our people at Omni.
they've been captured.

1906
01:45:58.350 --> 01:45:59.183
- I'm gonna call Martin.

1907
01:45:59.183 --> 01:46:00.059
Get 'em to send in the troops.

1908
01:46:00.059 --> 01:46:01.830
- That'll take too long.

1909
01:46:01.830 --> 01:46:03.900
- The person you're texting.

1910
01:46:03.900 --> 01:46:06.480
Do they know anything about computers?

1911
01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:07.313
- Yes. why?

1912
01:46:07.313 --> 01:46:09.360
- Give me back the controller.

1913
01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:11.580
I can tell them how to shut
down the game and stop the hack.

1914
01:46:11.580 --> 01:46:14.309
That'll at least distract Elena and Errol.

1915
01:46:14.309 --> 01:46:15.360
- I'm getting a message

1916
01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:17.730
from someone at Omni
Millennium named Jade.

1917
01:46:17.730 --> 01:46:20.520
They're sending us instructions
on how to access a back door

1918
01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:23.193
in the game and shut
down the cyber attack.

1919
01:46:26.070 --> 01:46:27.920
- Redirecting this to Mount Hideaway.

1920
01:46:29.993 --> 01:46:33.743
(dramatic orchestral music)

1921
01:46:57.450 --> 01:46:59.103
- Well. that's disappointing.

1922
01:47:06.210 --> 01:47:09.243
Someone at Mount Hideaway
has shut down our attacks.

1923
01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:14.850
I think I underestimated Jade.

1924
01:47:17.219 --> 01:47:20.643
Well. no matter. I think
it's time to cut bait.

1925
01:47:22.170 --> 01:47:23.550
Yep.

1926
01:47:23.550 --> 01:47:25.200
Blow all of it.

1927
01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:26.150
- What's she doing?

1928
01:47:28.672 --> 01:47:31.731
- They must have figured
out the hack's been stopped.

1929
01:47:31.731 --> 01:47:33.633
Gonna blow up this
building and us with it.

1930
01:47:35.661 --> 01:47:37.500
- What are we gonna do?

1931
01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:38.733
- Hey. look at this.

1932
01:47:41.070 --> 01:47:41.903
Watch this.

1933
01:47:48.957 --> 01:47:51.146
- It's set for 30 minutes.

1934
01:47:51.146 --> 01:47:52.860
That should give us plenty of
time to clear the building.

1935
01:47:52.860 --> 01:47:55.143
- Well. it's gonna give me plenty of time.

1936
01:47:56.490 --> 01:47:58.260
I'm sorry.

1937
01:47:58.260 --> 01:47:59.093
Your time's up.

1938
01:48:03.576 --> 01:48:04.576
- That's it.

1939
01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:09.570
You guys get to safety.
I'll disarm the bomb.

1940
01:48:11.610 --> 01:48:13.290
- Come on.
- Wait.

1941
01:48:13.290 --> 01:48:14.160
Where is Rose?

1942
01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:16.020
- What are you doing. are you crazy?

1943
01:48:16.020 --> 01:48:18.630
- She already died once.
I'm not losing her again.

1944
01:48:18.630 --> 01:48:19.653
Go. run.

1945
01:48:27.750 --> 01:48:29.763
- Step away from the bomb. partner.

1946
01:48:31.559 --> 01:48:34.980
I said. step away

1947
01:48:34.980 --> 01:48:35.820
from the bomb.

1948
01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:44.980
- And I thought you'd be long gone by now.

1949
01:48:51.985 --> 01:48:53.520
- I thought I told you to run to safety.

1950
01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:55.740
- Well. clearly you don't
know me very well yet.

1951
01:48:55.740 --> 01:48:57.990
You disarm the bomb.
I'll take care of Elena.

1952
01:49:03.059 --> 01:49:05.043
Give it up Elena. it's over.

1953
01:49:11.250 --> 01:49:12.750
- Let's finish this. Bradford.

1954
01:49:32.340 --> 01:49:33.180
- Put it down.

1955
01:49:43.465 --> 01:49:48.180
You and this company of
yours killed my boyfriend

1956
01:49:48.180 --> 01:49:49.833
and destroyed my family.

1957
01:49:51.809 --> 01:49:52.950
Give me one good reason

1958
01:49:52.950 --> 01:49:55.202
I shouldn't empty this gun into your face.

1959
01:50:04.380 --> 01:50:09.380
- You and Bethany and all of
your little Christian friends

1960
01:50:09.750 --> 01:50:11.219
with your perfect little families

1961
01:50:11.219 --> 01:50:13.263
and your little homeschool projects.

1962
01:50:14.668 --> 01:50:19.668
You have no idea what my life was like.

1963
01:50:22.818 --> 01:50:27.483
- Look. you can kill me. but
you can't kill a company.

1964
01:50:28.410 --> 01:50:31.473
It's too big. there's too many pieces.

1965
01:50:33.210 --> 01:50:34.410
but you know what they say?

1966
01:50:34.410 --> 01:50:36.750
If you can't beat 'em. join 'em.

1967
01:50:36.750 --> 01:50:38.430
- You've gotta be kidding.

1968
01:50:38.430 --> 01:50:39.263
- No.

1969
01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:41.610
I'm not.

1970
01:50:41.610 --> 01:50:46.610
Look. haven't you always wanted
to own your family's company

1971
01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:48.500
ever since you were a little girl?

1972
01:50:55.710 --> 01:50:59.133
Not only can I give you this company.

1973
01:51:00.465 --> 01:51:03.947
but I can also give you a
piece of a global empire.

1974
01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:06.843
It's changing the world.

1975
01:51:08.309 --> 01:51:11.393
- Yeah. that sounds like a lot of work.

1976
01:51:11.393 --> 01:51:14.190
I think I'll go with
instant gratification.

1977
01:51:14.190 --> 01:51:16.473
- Can I. can I. can I show you?

1978
01:51:19.347 --> 01:51:21.243
- You think our lives were perfect?

1979
01:51:22.650 --> 01:51:25.050
My mom died when I was seven.

1980
01:51:25.050 --> 01:51:27.719
Bethany's dad died serving our country.

1981
01:51:27.719 --> 01:51:29.880
All these years. we thought Rose was dead.

1982
01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:31.862
And then my best friend was murdered.

1983
01:51:37.980 --> 01:51:40.153
You did that. didn't you?

1984
01:51:41.100 --> 01:51:43.110
- I made a lot of money from killing Karl

1985
01:51:43.110 --> 01:51:44.880
and all the others.

1986
01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:48.213
but Bethany. I did that one for free.

1987
01:51:56.518 --> 01:51:58.684
(yelling)

1988
01:52:02.721 --> 01:52:03.554
- Amy!

1989
01:52:05.057 --> 01:52:05.889
Amy!

1990
01:52:21.796 --> 01:52:24.110
(sighing)

1991
01:52:24.110 --> 01:52:26.880
- If only Bethany could see you now.

1992
01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:29.163
she'd be so disappointed.

1993
01:52:41.160 --> 01:52:42.930
Oh Amy.

1994
01:52:42.930 --> 01:52:44.373
You're not gonna shoot me.

1995
01:52:45.330 --> 01:52:46.623
You don't have it in you.

1996
01:52:48.180 --> 01:52:49.053
- Don't test me.

1997
01:52:50.356 --> 01:52:51.600
- All right. come on
then. pull the trigger

1998
01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:52.750
if you've got the guts.

1999
01:52:54.030 --> 01:52:54.903
Or better yet.

2000
01:52:56.100 --> 01:52:59.793
how about you come and get
me a hug and forgive me.

2001
01:53:01.650 --> 01:53:04.263
Isn't that what your Jesus
said that you should do?

2002
01:53:06.570 --> 01:53:07.413
- How could you?

2003
01:53:09.696 --> 01:53:11.823
- Poor little Amy.

2004
01:53:14.504 --> 01:53:15.337
You're so weak.

2005
01:53:16.350 --> 01:53:17.553
So pathetic.

2006
01:53:19.020 --> 01:53:21.693
Without Bethany here
to tell you what to do.

2007
01:53:23.340 --> 01:53:25.620
- Billions of dollars.

2008
01:53:25.620 --> 01:53:30.120
Government officials. business leaders.

2009
01:53:30.120 --> 01:53:34.803
all who do whatever we
say. whatever you say.

2010
01:53:38.850 --> 01:53:39.850
You can have it all.

2011
01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:49.083
- You don't have it in you to
make the hard decisions. Amy.

2012
01:53:51.870 --> 01:53:52.893
So I dare you.

2013
01:53:54.030 --> 01:53:57.753
I dare you to prove me wrong. right now.

2014
01:53:59.939 --> 01:54:01.233
Do it!

2015
01:54:01.233 --> 01:54:02.373
- Amy. Amy don't.

2016
01:54:04.770 --> 01:54:06.930
She's taken enough from
you. don't let her win.

2017
01:54:06.930 --> 01:54:07.980
- [Elena] Do it. Amy.

2018
01:54:09.469 --> 01:54:10.302
Come on.

2019
01:54:26.309 --> 01:54:27.143
- Okay.

2020
01:54:27.990 --> 01:54:28.823
I'll take it.

2021
01:54:30.300 --> 01:54:31.450
- You'll take my offer?

2022
01:54:32.700 --> 01:54:35.969
- No. I'm gonna take it all away.

2023
01:54:35.969 --> 01:54:37.500
Right. Martin?

2024
01:54:37.500 --> 01:54:39.120
- Yep. we got it all.

2025
01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:41.700
All of those accounts are now frozen.

2026
01:54:41.700 --> 01:54:45.120
We've got tactical teams
headed to every location.

2027
01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:47.040
FBI and Interpol have been alerted.

2028
01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:48.990
and they are issuing indictments

2029
01:54:48.990 --> 01:54:52.230
for everyone in the
organization within 24 hours.

2030
01:54:52.230 --> 01:54:54.330
Great work. Rose and Hector.

2031
01:54:54.330 --> 01:54:56.280
- The tracker that Rose
put in Omni's system.

2032
01:54:56.280 --> 01:54:59.100
streamed everything right to us.

2033
01:54:59.100 --> 01:54:59.933
Boom.

2034
01:55:03.780 --> 01:55:04.612
- Feel better?

2035
01:55:06.180 --> 01:55:07.280
- Can I do the honors?

2036
01:55:12.429 --> 01:55:13.262
Yeah.

2037
01:55:14.940 --> 01:55:16.803
You wanna talk about Jesus so much?

2038
01:55:17.639 --> 01:55:18.797
I lead a Bible study.

2039
01:55:18.797 --> 01:55:21.647
at the women's correctional
facility. every second Tuesday.

2040
01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:24.910
Get her outta my sight.

2041
01:55:26.940 --> 01:55:28.040
- All right. let's go.

2042
01:55:35.340 --> 01:55:36.173
Hey.

2043
01:55:40.980 --> 01:55:41.813
How you doing?

2044
01:55:44.490 --> 01:55:45.323
- Not good.

2045
01:55:50.230 --> 01:55:52.561
- Wanna talk about it?

2046
01:55:52.561 --> 01:55:55.061
(soft music)

2047
01:55:57.330 --> 01:55:58.530
- I wanted to shoot her.

2048
01:56:02.499 --> 01:56:03.916
- But you didn't.

2049
01:56:05.787 --> 01:56:08.787
- It terrifies me how close I came.

2050
01:56:08.787 --> 01:56:11.550
- Yeah. but you made the right choice.

2051
01:56:11.550 --> 01:56:14.070
- But if you hadn't been
there. I don't know.

2052
01:56:17.227 --> 01:56:18.309
- Look at me.

2053
01:56:19.410 --> 01:56:21.460
I know exactly what you're going through.

2054
01:56:22.770 --> 01:56:25.559
I know what it's like
to feel so much rage.

2055
01:56:25.559 --> 01:56:27.059
it feels like it's gonna consume you.

2056
01:56:27.059 --> 01:56:28.809
like you can't even think straight.

2057
01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:33.090
But you didn't pull that trigger.

2058
01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:36.809
And I know that even
if I hadn't been there.

2059
01:56:36.809 --> 01:56:37.710
you wouldn't have.

2060
01:56:39.059 --> 01:56:40.170
- How do you know?

2061
01:56:40.170 --> 01:56:41.170
- 'Cause I know you.

2062
01:56:43.020 --> 01:56:44.237
Amy you're.

2063
01:56:44.237 --> 01:56:45.430
you're gentle

2064
01:56:47.219 --> 01:56:48.223
and kind and

2065
01:56:49.119 --> 01:56:50.119
full of God's mercy.

2066
01:56:54.570 --> 01:56:56.920
You and Elena have been
through some bad stuff.

2067
01:56:58.980 --> 01:57:01.230
She chose to take her pain

2068
01:57:01.230 --> 01:57:03.693
and use it as an excuse to hurt people.

2069
01:57:05.100 --> 01:57:06.093
You help people.

2070
01:57:07.830 --> 01:57:10.233
All those furry little critters of yours.

2071
01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:13.900
- Don't forget the snakes.

2072
01:57:14.790 --> 01:57:16.639
- You had to bring it up. didn't you?

2073
01:57:17.940 --> 01:57:20.813
Yeah. I'm gonna have to side
with Indiana Jones on that one.

2074
01:57:26.700 --> 01:57:27.834
- Thank you.

2075
01:57:27.834 --> 01:57:28.751
- For what?

2076
01:57:29.866 --> 01:57:31.282
- Having my back.

2077
01:57:33.869 --> 01:57:34.702
- Always.

2078
01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:43.020
- Hector. I gotta say it was
a real surprise to see you

2079
01:57:43.020 --> 01:57:45.630
send me over that
non-disclosure agreement.

2080
01:57:45.630 --> 01:57:47.790
- What non-disclose agreement?

2081
01:57:47.790 --> 01:57:49.320
I was responding to your offer.

2082
01:57:49.320 --> 01:57:51.362
for full amnesty and a consulting job.

2083
01:57:54.389 --> 01:57:55.223
- Angie?

2084
01:57:58.289 --> 01:58:00.706
(chuckling)

2085
01:58:04.290 --> 01:58:05.523
- So.

2086
01:58:07.020 --> 01:58:09.003
I've been thinking.

2087
01:58:11.370 --> 01:58:15.663
we've both lost people
that we love very much.

2088
01:58:18.150 --> 01:58:20.100
and we both

2089
01:58:20.100 --> 01:58:21.213
well are.

2090
01:58:25.020 --> 01:58:25.923
- Incomplete?

2091
01:58:28.290 --> 01:58:29.123
- Yeah.

2092
01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:32.090
- So what are you saying?

2093
01:58:34.290 --> 01:58:35.469
- I'm saying that

2094
01:58:36.990 --> 01:58:41.463
I would like to legally
adopt you as my daughter.

2095
01:58:42.809 --> 01:58:45.362
You can keep your last name of course.

2096
01:58:48.330 --> 01:58:50.643
but we could be a real family.

2097
01:58:53.010 --> 01:58:54.660
Joy loves the idea.

2098
01:58:54.660 --> 01:58:55.983
She's so excited.

2099
01:58:58.180 --> 01:59:00.972
And I think Bethany would love it too.

2100
01:59:15.889 --> 01:59:18.056
- I want to do this right.

2101
01:59:24.150 --> 01:59:26.793
Ruth chapter one. verse 16.

2102
01:59:29.790 --> 01:59:30.873
But Ruth said.

2103
01:59:31.800 --> 01:59:33.303
do not tell me to leave you.

2104
01:59:35.025 --> 01:59:36.875
or just turn back from following you.

2105
01:59:38.517 --> 01:59:40.443
For where you go. I will go.

2106
01:59:41.880 --> 01:59:45.059
And where you stay. I will stay.

2107
01:59:45.059 --> 01:59:48.963
Your people shall be my
people. and your God. my God.

2108
01:59:59.775 --> 02:00:01.275
I love you.
- I love you too.

2109
02:00:08.815 --> 02:00:11.070
(light instrumental music)

2110
02:00:11.070 --> 02:00:12.750
- [Amy] Isn't it great to see how the town

2111
02:00:12.750 --> 02:00:14.313
is coming back to life again?

2112
02:00:18.210 --> 02:00:21.093
Omni Millennium is getting
shut down all over the world.

2113
02:00:23.820 --> 02:00:25.950
Rose took over her family's business

2114
02:00:25.950 --> 02:00:27.903
and started hiring locals.

2115
02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:31.800
Hector is busier than ever

2116
02:00:31.800 --> 02:00:34.680
between being Rose's
Chief Technical Officer

2117
02:00:34.680 --> 02:00:37.083
and his consulting work
for Mount Hideaway.

2118
02:00:40.110 --> 02:00:42.513
Other businesses are
starting to open up again.

2119
02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:49.050
Angie's adoption is almost finalized.

2120
02:00:49.050 --> 02:00:51.810
and my dad is helping
her get a scholarship.

2121
02:00:51.810 --> 02:00:54.630
She's not sure if she wants

or a cyber warrior.

2123
02:00:56.790 --> 02:00:59.403
Knowing her it'll likely
be a little of both.

02:01:01.380 --> 02:01:05.223
Caleb and I are getting
to know each other.

2125
02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:13.043
You know. we couldn't have
done this without you. right?

2126
02:01:15.876 --> 02:01:19.260
You and I have so many precious memories

2127
02:01:19.260 --> 02:01:21.153
that I will always treasure.

2128
02:01:29.730 --> 02:01:32.220
I don't know where my journey's
gonna take me next. but

2129
02:01:35.495 --> 02:01:37.078
I have a few ideas.

2130
02:01:41.876 --> 02:01:43.293
I love you. Beth.

2131
02:01:45.015 --> 02:01:45.987

- Hey.

2132
02:01:45.987 --> 02:01:47.340

02:01:47.340 --> 02:01:48.660
- Yep.

2134
02:01:48.660 --> 02:01:50.910
- Kind of looking forward
to dinner with your dad.

2135
02:01:50.910 --> 02:01:52.800
- Yeah. so I do have to warn you.

2136
02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:53.880
whenever I bring a guy over.

2137
02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:56.280
he usually starts by showing
off his gun collection.

2138
02:01:56.280 --> 02:01:57.903
- Yeah?
- It's a dad thing.

2139
02:01:58.770 --> 02:02:00.210
- Sounds like my kind of guy.

2140
02:02:00.210 --> 02:02:01.043
- Yeah?
