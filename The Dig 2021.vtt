[seagulls crying]

7
00:00:35.916 --> 00:00:38.875
-Well. I expect it'll cloud over later on.
-[ferryman] Aye.

8
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:42.250
What's going on at Sutton Hoo. then?

9
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.416
[man] There's a lady
who's got an excavating job.

10
00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:52.125
-Ah. thank you kindly. Mind how you go.
-Thank you.

11
00:01:06.708 --> 00:01:09.416

[doorbell clicks. rings]

16
00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:42.166
Mornin'. Mrs. Pretty. please.

17
00:01:43.291 --> 00:01:44.250
Basil Brown.

18
00:01:45.208 --> 00:01:46.083
Wait here.

19
00:02:03.041 --> 00:02:05.041
[piano theme fades]

20
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.791
-Should we take a look at them. then?
-[Brown] Right.

21
00:02:13.375 --> 00:02:16.500
Things like this
are usually done through museums.

22
00:02:17.541 --> 00:02:20.333
[Pretty] Yes.
But when I approached Ipswich.

23
00:02:20.416 --> 00:02:22.208
Mr. Reid Moir said
that. with the war coming.

24
00:02:22.291 --> 00:02:24.291
they couldn't embark upon
any new ventures.

25
00:02:24.375 --> 00:02:27.458
[Brown] Well. they have their hands full
with a Roman villa.

26
00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.208
-Yes. He said you were working on it.
-[Brown] I am.

27
00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:32.416
He told me you were a difficult man.

28
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.791
[chuckles] Did he. now?

29
00:02:34.875 --> 00:02:38.000
Unorthodox… and untrained.

30
00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:40.125
[Brown] Hmm.
So that's his reference. is it?

31
00:02:40.208 --> 00:02:42.875
[chuckles] Well. I'm… I'm not untrained.

32
00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:46.083
I've been on dig
since I was old enough to hold a trowel.

33
00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:48.375
[sighs] My father taught me.

34
00:02:49.875 --> 00:02:52.458
Perhaps Reid Moir
just wants to keep you for himself.

35
00:02:52.541 --> 00:02:54.916
-[Brown] I don't know about that.
-[both chuckle]

36
00:02:55.875 --> 00:02:59.208
[Brown] I've always had a curiosity
to see these here mounds.

37
00:03:00.166 --> 00:03:03.750
-Henry VIII came here to dig.
-[Pretty] So I'm told.

38
00:03:03.833 --> 00:03:06.208
[Brown] Well. no record of what he found.

39
00:03:06.708 --> 00:03:08.125
[Pretty]
My husband and I bought this land.

40
00:03:08.208 --> 00:03:10.041
with the hope of exploring
what was under there.

41
00:03:10.125 --> 00:03:13.708
-But… Well. best-laid plans.
-[Brown chuckles]

42
00:03:14.208 --> 00:03:16.791
[Pretty] What are they?
Would you hazard a guess?

43
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:19.291
[Brown] Burial mounds. I expect.

44
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.458
We're standing
in someone's graveyard. I reckon.

45
00:03:24.875 --> 00:03:25.708
Viking…

46
00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.208
or maybe older.

47
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.666
Apparently. local girls used to lie down
on them in the hope of falling pregnant.

48
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:34.625
[Brown chuckles]

49
00:03:34.708 --> 00:03:37.083
I've heard plenty of legends.

50
00:03:38.041 --> 00:03:40.208
Is that why you want to dig. Mrs. Pretty?

51
00:03:41.458 --> 00:03:42.958
Tales of buried treasure?

52
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.000
My interest
in archaeology began like yours.

53
00:03:48.083 --> 00:03:50.250
when I was scarcely old enough
to hold a trowel.

54
00:03:51.208 --> 00:03:53.833
My childhood home
was built on a Cistercian convent.

55
00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:56.791
I helped my father excavate the apse.

56
00:03:58.458 --> 00:03:59.916
That speaks. don't it?

57
00:04:01.625 --> 00:04:02.541
The past.

58
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.458
You have rabbits. Mrs. Pretty.

59
00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:09.958
Yes. I am aware of that. [chuckles]

60
00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:11.500
[Brown] Rabbits burrow.

61
00:04:11.583 --> 00:04:13.250
They're bad for excavations.

62
00:04:14.458 --> 00:04:16.375
I'd like to start with this one.

63
00:04:16.458 --> 00:04:18.625
[Brown] Ah. I wouldn't start
with this one. Mrs. Pretty.

64
00:04:18.708 --> 00:04:20.250
not personally speaking.

65
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.083
-[Pretty] Why not?
-'Cause that dips in the middle. see?

66
00:04:25.666 --> 00:04:28.041
And the soil feels-- That's compacted.

67
00:04:28.833 --> 00:04:31.000
Thieves used to sink shafts in.

68
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.416
Robber's flutes. they're called.

69
00:04:34.291 --> 00:04:36.166
Anything they found
would've been melted down

70
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.708
and sold long ago.

71
00:04:38.583 --> 00:04:40.458
I expect you might be better off with…

72
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.166
one of these.

73
00:04:43.583 --> 00:04:45.458
But I have a feeling about this one.

74
00:04:45.541 --> 00:04:47.250
[Brown]
Well. that's your money. Mrs. Pretty.

75
00:04:47.333 --> 00:04:48.958
but I'd base your dig on evidence.

76
00:04:49.041 --> 00:04:50.625
not feeling.

77
00:04:54.458 --> 00:04:56.583
[Pretty] As for money.
would 1 pound. 15 shillings.

78
00:04:56.666 --> 00:04:58.333
and 6 pence a week be acceptable?

79
00:04:58.833 --> 00:04:59.666
Oh…

80
00:05:00.416 --> 00:05:03.875
-No.
-[Pretty] I asked Reid Moir what he pays.

81
00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.291
-That was his reply.
-Well. he don't pay enough.

82
00:05:06.375 --> 00:05:08.166
-[footsteps approach]
-[Pretty] All right.

83
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.541
I'm afraid that's all
I can reasonably afford to spend.

84
00:05:10.625 --> 00:05:12.500
-[boy shouting]
-[Brown] Right. then. Understood.

85
00:05:12.583 --> 00:05:16.583
Robert. where did you get that gas mask?
Take it off.

86
00:05:17.291 --> 00:05:19.833
-Sorry. I didn't realize you were--
-This is not a toy.

87
00:05:19.916 --> 00:05:21.375
Robert. this is Mr. Brown.

88
00:05:21.875 --> 00:05:25.333
-Hello there. young man.
-[Robert] Robert Pretty. How do you do?

89
00:05:25.416 --> 00:05:26.333
Who's coming after you?

90
00:05:26.416 --> 00:05:29.250
-Captain Laska and his gangsters.
-[Brown] Oh!

91
00:05:29.333 --> 00:05:33.083
-[Pretty] Mr. Brown is an archaeologist.
-Well. I'm an excavator.

92
00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:35.625
-You've come to dig up the mounds?
-[Brown] Well…

93
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.541
I'm afraid not. Uh. not today.

94
00:05:40.625 --> 00:05:41.500
Excuse me.

95
00:05:41.583 --> 00:05:42.666
[Robert sighs]

96
00:05:44.166 --> 00:05:48.208
-Good luck with your gangsters. Robert.
-[Robert chuckles] Thank you.

97
00:05:48.291 --> 00:05:50.750
[Brown] And you. with your dig. ma'am.

98
00:05:54.541 --> 00:05:56.541
-[wind whistling]
-[birds calling]

99
00:06:01.583 --> 00:06:02.708
[Brown sighs]

100
00:06:09.083 --> 00:06:10.208
Ah. blast.

101
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:16.750
[car approaching]

102
00:06:20.208 --> 00:06:21.916
[brakes squeak]

103
00:06:26.291 --> 00:06:27.541
-Mr. Brown?
-Yes?

104
00:06:28.083 --> 00:06:30.666
Billy Lyons. Uh. uh. from Mrs. Pretty.

105
00:06:31.625 --> 00:06:32.541
All right.

106
00:06:33.791 --> 00:06:34.666
Hmm.

107
00:06:38.625 --> 00:06:40.916
[sighs. clicks tongue]

108
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.791
[bright orchestral music playing]

109
00:06:43.875 --> 00:06:47.000
Tell her Monday. 8:00 sharp.

110
00:06:48.083 --> 00:06:50.333
[Brown] I won't work
for less than two pound a week.

111
00:06:51.166 --> 00:06:54.125
And it's too far to bike.
if you want a day's digging.

112
00:06:54.208 --> 00:06:56.916
[Pretty] You could lodge with the Lyonses
in the coach house.

113
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.333
Mr. Lyons is my chauffeur.

114
00:06:58.416 --> 00:07:00.416
and Mrs. Lyons
is in charge of the kitchen.

115
00:07:01.791 --> 00:07:05.583
-[Brown sighs] Well. I'll need help.
-[Pretty] I could let you have one man.

116
00:07:06.833 --> 00:07:08.291
[Brown] Two would be better.

117
00:07:09.333 --> 00:07:12.041
[Pretty] I'm glad we could come
to an arrangement after all. Mr. Brown.

118
00:07:15.708 --> 00:07:18.666
John Jacobs and Mr. Spooner
are bringing the shepherd's hut.

119
00:07:19.708 --> 00:07:21.958
I thought it might be useful
in case of inclement weather.

120
00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:23.958
Oh. that's very considerate.

121
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.791
My son Robert
is keen to assist you in any way.

122
00:07:30.875 --> 00:07:32.916
If you find his presence irksome--

123
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.583
Oh. no. no. no. He can come.

124
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:36.916
You'll start with this one?

125
00:07:38.916 --> 00:07:39.791
[Brown] Yeah.

126
00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:44.291
I reckon we can forget
that larger mound. Mrs. Pretty.

127
00:07:44.875 --> 00:07:48.083
This one here.
that's where we'll find something.

128
00:07:48.583 --> 00:07:51.750
Well. shan't hold you up.
[chuckles softly]

129
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.625
[Brown] Thank you kindly.

130
00:08:02.125 --> 00:08:05.958
If you ask me. the man should leave
Mrs. Pretty's mounds well alone.

131
00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:18.833
[Brown grunts]

132
00:08:32.541 --> 00:08:33.708
[panting]

133
00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958
[seagulls crying]

134
00:08:57.791 --> 00:09:00.250
-[maid] Thank you. ma'am.
-[Pretty] Great. dear. Thank you.

135
00:09:01.083 --> 00:09:03.958
Darling. please be gentle.
You'll knock me down.

136
00:09:04.041 --> 00:09:06.375
[Robert]
I'm sorry. Mr. Brown says to come.

137
00:09:07.083 --> 00:09:08.583
-Now?
-[Robert] Yes.

138
00:09:10.708 --> 00:09:11.958
Well. thank you for the message.

139
00:09:12.041 --> 00:09:15.666
Well. it looks like the kind of tray
you get at a butcher's.

140
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:20.166
And there's some blackness here.
maybe indicating a fire was made.

141
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:21.458
Who are those men?

142
00:09:22.041 --> 00:09:25.208
[Pretty] They're from the Ipswich Museum.
Mr. Reid Moir telephoned me.

143
00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:28.083
He wanted to see how things
were progressing. so I invited him.

144
00:09:28.166 --> 00:09:32.208
Mrs. Pretty.
this is Guy Maynard. our new curator.

145
00:09:32.291 --> 00:09:33.666
-How do you do?
-[Pretty] Hello.

146
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:34.583
Hello. Brown.

147
00:09:34.666 --> 00:09:38.000
Maynard. Can I borrow you.
please. for this here corner?

148
00:09:38.666 --> 00:09:39.500
Jolly good.

149
00:09:40.375 --> 00:09:41.333
[Brown] One.

150
00:09:42.833 --> 00:09:44.500
-You have it? Two.
-[Maynard] Yeah.

151
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
-[Brown] Three! Blast.
-[Maynard grunts]

152
00:09:48.791 --> 00:09:50.333
Is that the sum of your labors?

153
00:09:52.791 --> 00:09:53.833
[Brown] Excuse me.

154
00:09:59.166 --> 00:10:00.375
[tool clatters]

155
00:10:02.041 --> 00:10:04.041
[somber orchestral music playing]

156
00:10:10.083 --> 00:10:12.916
[indistinct chatter]

157
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:18.041
[Reid Moir] I must urge you. Mrs. Pretty.
to support our Roman villa.

158
00:10:18.125 --> 00:10:19.291
War is looming.

159
00:10:19.375 --> 00:10:23.083
All hands are on deck
to excavate before hostilities begin.

160
00:10:23.166 --> 00:10:26.125
And so.
we must ask you to return Mr. Brown.

161
00:10:28.208 --> 00:10:30.333
I'd like him to finish what he's started.

162
00:10:30.416 --> 00:10:34.083
[Reid Moir chuckles] We may have found
the largest Roman villa

163
00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:35.166
north of Felixstowe.

164
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:39.458
It's of far greater import.
if… if you'll forgive me. than this…

165
00:10:40.083 --> 00:10:41.083
minor venture.

166
00:10:42.291 --> 00:10:45.166
-Then the choice is Mr. Brown's.
-Excuse me.

167
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.416
Time had altered that piece of wood

168
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:49.833
to compacted sand.

169
00:10:50.583 --> 00:10:52.583
I didn't guess its age correctly.

170
00:10:53.208 --> 00:10:56.166
I speculated Viking.
but I think that's older.

171
00:10:57.333 --> 00:10:59.583
-Anglo-Saxon.
-That's most unlikely. Brown.

172
00:10:59.666 --> 00:11:03.458
We should-- We need you back at the villa.
That's what I'm here to say. and…

173
00:11:03.541 --> 00:11:05.875
and Mrs. Pretty has released you.

174
00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:08.833
I have said it is your choice.

175
00:11:10.666 --> 00:11:11.958
Well. then I'll stay.

176
00:11:12.791 --> 00:11:14.250
Thank you kindly. ma'am.

177
00:11:16.791 --> 00:11:17.625
Excuse me.

178
00:11:17.708 --> 00:11:19.250
Now. look here. Brown.

179
00:11:19.333 --> 00:11:21.583
You've made your point.
You can have two pounds a week.

180
00:11:21.666 --> 00:11:23.375
We'll give you a few days
to finish off here.

181
00:11:23.458 --> 00:11:25.708
and then.
as we're the only museum in the area.

182
00:11:25.791 --> 00:11:28.500
I'd carefully consider
where your future lies.

183
00:11:32.041 --> 00:11:32.875
Understood.

184
00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.375
[Robert] Mr. Brown's been telling us
all sorts of things.

185
00:11:35.458 --> 00:11:37.833
For instance.
what's the most important part

186
00:11:37.916 --> 00:11:39.375
of an archaeologist's body?

187
00:11:39.458 --> 00:11:42.208
-I don't know.
-[clock chiming]

188
00:11:42.291 --> 00:11:43.250
His nose.

189
00:11:44.125 --> 00:11:46.833
If there's something there.
he'll know it by the smell.

190
00:11:53.416 --> 00:11:55.208
You're going to see your father
this afternoon?

191
00:11:58.375 --> 00:12:00.500
I… I'm afraid I'm needed here.

192
00:12:01.333 --> 00:12:05.416
-Um. please. may I get down?
-If you're quite sure you've finished.

193
00:12:10.291 --> 00:12:13.541
[sighs deeply]

194
00:12:13.625 --> 00:12:16.291
[somber piano music playing]

195
00:12:23.916 --> 00:12:26.333
[takes a deep breath]

196
00:12:32.833 --> 00:12:35.208
[indistinct chatter]

197
00:12:35.291 --> 00:12:39.416
[soldiers clamoring. muffled]

198
00:13:28.666 --> 00:13:30.083
[Pretty sighs]

199
00:13:32.375 --> 00:13:35.041
[breathing heavily]

200
00:13:36.375 --> 00:13:37.541
[man] Boiled beef…

201
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:42.125
on a hot day like this is unlikely
to agree with anyone. Mrs. Lyons.

202
00:13:43.041 --> 00:13:45.208
[Pretty] It was exactly like last time.

203
00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:49.916
[doctor] Mrs. Pretty. you produce
all this acid because you're a worrier.

204
00:13:50.416 --> 00:13:52.625
We've spoken on this subject before.

205
00:13:53.583 --> 00:13:56.708
-You must learn to stop worrying.
-[sighs]

206
00:13:56.791 --> 00:13:59.458
[doctor]
Otherwise. you'll give yourself an ulcer.

207
00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.583
-Well… if that's what you think.
-[doctor] Mm-hmm.

208
00:14:07.291 --> 00:14:09.291
[clock ticking]

209
00:14:21.458 --> 00:14:23.458
[gentle piano music playing]

210
00:14:45.291 --> 00:14:47.291
[grass rustling]

211
00:14:50.625 --> 00:14:52.500
[insects chirping]

212
00:15:21.375 --> 00:15:24.541
Oh. you don't wanna be down there.
Mrs. Pretty. That ain't safe.

213
00:15:25.041 --> 00:15:27.083
Spooner and John Jacobs
are making supports.

214
00:15:27.166 --> 00:15:29.375
We can't continue without them now.

215
00:15:30.375 --> 00:15:32.416
I was reading Howard Carter's account

216
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.000
of his excavation
of the tomb of Tutankhamun.

217
00:15:35.083 --> 00:15:35.916
[Brown] Oh?

218
00:15:38.833 --> 00:15:41.625
He stood at the threshold
of the burial chamber.

219
00:15:42.208 --> 00:15:45.125
the first man to do so for 3.000 years.

220
00:15:45.208 --> 00:15:48.375
and he saw finger marks
still on the paint.

221
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.666
He say. "Time lost its meaning."

222
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.500
It occurs to me
that you might unearth human remains.

223
00:16:01.083 --> 00:16:02.833
[Brown] Yeah. that's possible.

224
00:16:04.041 --> 00:16:06.333
[Pretty]
We're digging down to meet the dead.

225
00:16:07.875 --> 00:16:09.250
Disinterring them. in fact.

226
00:16:09.333 --> 00:16:12.416
[Brown] There's always coroner's inquests
when remains are found.

227
00:16:13.125 --> 00:16:17.750
The dead still get that courtesy.
no matter how many centuries they've lain.

228
00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:21.958
We can't dig down into the earth
without considering that--

229
00:16:22.041 --> 00:16:22.875
Oh!

230
00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:24.708
-[soil rustles]
-[sound muffles]

231
00:16:29.916 --> 00:16:31.166
[Pretty. muffled] Brown?

232
00:16:34.291 --> 00:16:36.291
-[soil shifting]
-[Pretty gasps]

233
00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:39.875
Mr. Brown?

234
00:16:42.041 --> 00:16:45.416
Spooner! Jacob! Get help!

235
00:16:46.291 --> 00:16:49.208
-[sound fades]
-[tense orchestral music playing]

236
00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:25.541
[orchestral music swells]

237
00:17:28.583 --> 00:17:30.250
[man] There! There! There!

238
00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:32.875
Come on. Basil!

239
00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:36.166
[group clamoring indistinctly]

240
00:18:00.541 --> 00:18:02.166
[Pretty cries out indistinctly]

241
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:21.708
[Pretty] Careful with his head.

242
00:18:21.791 --> 00:18:23.708
[group grunting]

243
00:18:23.791 --> 00:18:26.208
[tense orchestral music continues playing]

244
00:18:32.708 --> 00:18:34.958
[Pretty] Mr. Brown! Mr. Brown!

245
00:18:35.041 --> 00:18:36.291
Mr. Brown!

246
00:18:47.583 --> 00:18:48.791
Mr. Brown?

247
00:18:51.208 --> 00:18:52.500
[sputters]

248
00:18:52.583 --> 00:18:54.750
-[Pretty] That's it.
-[Jacobs] That's it.

249
00:18:54.833 --> 00:18:57.708
-[Brown gasps]
-Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown.

250
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.208
-[groans]
-[Pretty breathing shakily]

251
00:19:04.291 --> 00:19:07.958
You're all right now.
You're all right. You're all right.

252
00:19:08.583 --> 00:19:10.416
[sighs. chuckles] You're all right.

253
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.250
Into the library. Grateley.
Lay him on the sofa.

254
00:19:18.541 --> 00:19:20.875
[somber piano music playing]

255
00:19:31.041 --> 00:19:32.625
[sighs tremulously]

256
00:19:35.041 --> 00:19:36.583
[Pretty] Did you see something?

257
00:19:38.958 --> 00:19:39.833
[Brown] See something?

258
00:19:41.041 --> 00:19:42.166
When you were gone.

259
00:19:44.333 --> 00:19:45.291
Oh…

260
00:19:46.083 --> 00:19:48.000
Something did come into my head.

261
00:19:48.875 --> 00:19:49.875
What was it?

262
00:19:50.791 --> 00:19:53.958
[clicks tongue] My. uh… my grandfather.

263
00:19:55.916 --> 00:19:57.000
I have his name.

264
00:19:58.208 --> 00:19:59.416
Basil Brown.

265
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.083
Farming man.

266
00:20:03.791 --> 00:20:06.583
Taught me everything I know
about Suffolk soil.

267
00:20:08.125 --> 00:20:09.166
And you saw him?

268
00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:12.791
[Brown] Oh. I saw nothing at all.
I was just…

269
00:20:13.583 --> 00:20:16.875
I just thought of him. [sighs]

270
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.916
Well… perhaps he saw you.
[chuckles softly]

271
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.250
-Excuse me.
-Mr. Brown. are you all right?

272
00:20:24.333 --> 00:20:25.333
[Pretty] Mr. Brown!

273
00:20:26.291 --> 00:20:27.916
Mr. Brown. you have to rest!

274
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.375
See. Mrs. Pretty…
this one is the one you like.

275
00:20:32.458 --> 00:20:35.416
It's the one you wanted me to start on.
It's oval.

276
00:20:35.916 --> 00:20:37.375
Like a hog's back.

277
00:20:37.458 --> 00:20:40.000
[both panting]

278
00:20:40.083 --> 00:20:44.541
-See? All the others. circular.
-Yes.

279
00:20:44.625 --> 00:20:47.083
Now.
this land's been plowed for 1.000 year.

280
00:20:48.416 --> 00:20:51.458
Now. supposing whoever plowed here…

281
00:20:52.458 --> 00:20:54.166
gradually knocked a bit off.

282
00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:56.125
So. by the time robbers come along.

283
00:20:56.208 --> 00:20:59.625
they'd have sunk the flute
into what they thought was the center.

284
00:20:59.708 --> 00:21:02.041
-[Pretty] But it might not have been.
-[Brown] That's right.

285
00:21:02.125 --> 00:21:04.250
East to west. that's my feeling.

286
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:08.208
[chuckles] You say the word…

287
00:21:09.208 --> 00:21:10.708
[laughs]

288
00:21:11.625 --> 00:21:13.333
…and I'll dig.

289
00:21:13.416 --> 00:21:15.000
[Pretty chuckles]

290
00:21:16.958 --> 00:21:19.833
[energetic instrumental music playing]

291
00:21:42.375 --> 00:21:45.125
[Robert] My plane crashed
into the Arctic waste. you see.

292
00:21:45.708 --> 00:21:49.375
And when I woke up. 500 years had passed.

293
00:21:49.458 --> 00:21:53.250
-So. now I'm stuck in the 25th century.
-[Brown] What's that like. then?

294
00:21:53.333 --> 00:21:55.541
Well.
the Earth is controlled by Killer Kane.

295
00:21:55.625 --> 00:21:57.083
who's an extremely evil man.

296
00:21:57.166 --> 00:21:58.250
[Brown] Like Hitler?

297
00:21:58.333 --> 00:22:01.083
[chuckles]
Yes. with an even worse mustache.

298
00:22:01.166 --> 00:22:02.000
Did the people

299
00:22:02.083 --> 00:22:04.583
who made these burial mounds
have mustaches?

300
00:22:04.666 --> 00:22:05.791
[Brown] And beards.

301
00:22:06.416 --> 00:22:08.458
They were a very beardy lot.

302
00:22:08.541 --> 00:22:12.083
Not like them there Romans.
Now. they liked the close shave.

303
00:22:12.166 --> 00:22:15.958
The Vikings and the space pilots
are the same. really. aren't they?

304
00:22:16.458 --> 00:22:19.791
They explore new lands
and have battles in ships.

305
00:22:19.875 --> 00:22:25.250
Yeah. when you put it like that.
I suppose they might be the same.

306
00:22:25.333 --> 00:22:27.500
[warplanes roaring]

307
00:22:27.583 --> 00:22:31.000
[Robert] They come over all the time.
There's an RAF base nearby.

308
00:22:32.083 --> 00:22:34.166
[imitates weaponry firing]

309
00:22:35.791 --> 00:22:37.708
Would you like to fly. Mr. Brown?

310
00:22:37.791 --> 00:22:39.041
[Brown] Oh. but I do.

311
00:22:39.625 --> 00:22:43.833
All over the cosmos.
every time I look through my telescope.

312
00:22:44.583 --> 00:22:45.958
You… You have a telescope?

313
00:22:46.041 --> 00:22:48.375
-I do.
-[Robert] Did you bring it with you?

314
00:22:48.458 --> 00:22:49.625
[Brown] I did.

315
00:22:49.708 --> 00:22:51.375
Well. will you show me?

316
00:22:52.541 --> 00:22:53.500
I might.

317
00:22:53.583 --> 00:22:54.916
[Robert chuckles softly]

318
00:22:56.166 --> 00:22:57.833
[imitates weaponry firing]

319
00:22:58.333 --> 00:23:00.583
Cor! He likes to natter. he does.

320
00:23:00.666 --> 00:23:02.916
What was all that about space travel?

321
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.791
[Robert panting]

322
00:23:05.875 --> 00:23:08.333
[maid]
Mr. Brown had an awful lot of books.

323
00:23:08.833 --> 00:23:11.333
Came on his bike
with a great parcel of them.

324
00:23:11.916 --> 00:23:13.875
Sloan says some are in Norwegian.

325
00:23:14.375 --> 00:23:15.916
Shall we try the green silk?

326
00:23:16.416 --> 00:23:18.666
-It's an old favorite. isn't it?
-[Pretty] No.

327
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:21.708
The velvet with the lace.

328
00:23:21.791 --> 00:23:23.791
[birds singing outside]

329
00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.500
[clock chiming]

00:23:41.583 --> 00:23:45.041
[footsteps approach]

331
00:23:46.791 --> 00:23:48.666
[Grateley] Mrs. Lyons hopes it will agree.

332
00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:51.125
[Pretty] How's your leg. Mr. Grateley?

333
00:23:51.208 --> 00:23:54.208
Oh. much better. ma'am.
Thank you for inquiring.

334
00:23:55.625 --> 00:23:56.875
Would you like the wireless?

335
00:23:56.958 --> 00:23:59.666
-[Pretty] Yes. please.
-[clicks on]

336
00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:02.291
[radio announcer] …the Air Guard
under the age of 32

337
00:24:02.375 --> 00:24:04.041
are now being asked to stand by

338
00:24:04.125 --> 00:24:07.125
for further training
as RAF pilots or crew.

339
00:24:07.208 --> 00:24:09.166
[Mrs. Lyons] She's only been here 12 year.

340
00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:12.083
-[Billy] Mm-hmm.
-Came down from Cheshire.

341
00:24:13.041 --> 00:24:14.875
Then she married the colonel.

342
00:24:15.375 --> 00:24:19.333
He first met with Edith
when she was still at school.

343
00:24:19.416 --> 00:24:22.916
And on his 17th birthday.
he asked her to marry him.

344
00:24:23.666 --> 00:24:25.458
-She turned him down.
-[Billy] Mm.

345
00:24:25.541 --> 00:24:28.333
She say
she can't possibly leave her father.

346
00:24:29.583 --> 00:24:30.791
[Billy grunts softly]

347
00:24:31.291 --> 00:24:36.541
[Mrs. Lyons] She cared for her father
another 13 year. until he died.

348
00:24:36.625 --> 00:24:37.875
[Billy] After 13 years.

349
00:24:38.375 --> 00:24:42.000
[Mrs. Lyons] She finally accepted
the colonel's proposal.

350
00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:44.916
He been asking every year on her birthday.

351
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.125
[Billy] On her birthday.

352
00:24:48.208 --> 00:24:50.250
[Mrs. Lyons] Just after they had Robert…

353
00:24:51.208 --> 00:24:52.958
her husband went and died too.

354
00:24:53.041 --> 00:24:54.708
-[Billy] Mm-hmm.
-[Pretty kisses]

355
00:24:56.041 --> 00:24:57.541
[Mrs. Lyons] Imagine that.

356
00:24:57.625 --> 00:24:59.833
[men laughing]

357
00:25:00.583 --> 00:25:05.250
[chattering indistinctly]

358
00:25:05.333 --> 00:25:07.250
[Brown]
Do any of you want to look through this?

359
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.125
-[man] I thought we'd sit down on that.
-[Brown] You have a go.

360
00:25:13.958 --> 00:25:14.791
That's right.

361
00:25:15.625 --> 00:25:19.041
-[Jacobs] I'm gonna follow you back home.
-[group laughing]

362
00:25:19.666 --> 00:25:21.958
[Brown] Wait! Wait. for Christ's sake!

363
00:25:23.541 --> 00:25:25.500
[seagulls crying]

364
00:25:27.458 --> 00:25:28.416
[exhales]

365
00:25:28.916 --> 00:25:30.166
[Brown] Come on.

366
00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:31.333
[grunts]

367
00:25:31.416 --> 00:25:33.541
[church bell ringing]

368
00:25:33.625 --> 00:25:35.500
[ship horn blows]

369
00:25:35.583 --> 00:25:37.666
[seagulls crying]

370
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:39.625
-[bicycle bell rings]
-[brakes squeak]

371
00:25:40.291 --> 00:25:42.291
[Brown panting]

372
00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:44.916
[Brown] Maynard! Maynard!

373
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.916
They found an iron rivet
at the burial mound at Snape. didn't they?

374
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.208
[Maynard] Snape?
Basil. what have you found?

375
00:25:56.375 --> 00:25:57.750
My goodness. Basil.

376
00:26:01.125 --> 00:26:04.041
-[Spooner] Right. Any joy. Basil?
-[Brown] Coming along together.

377
00:26:04.625 --> 00:26:07.500
Mr. Spooner. will you bring
my tape measure from the hut?

378
00:26:07.583 --> 00:26:09.666
One of you best get Mrs. Pretty down here.

379
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:13.375
-[Jacobs] She's gone up to London.
-She what? How long?

380
00:26:13.458 --> 00:26:16.041
[Jacobs] London. with Robert.
Couple of days.

381
00:26:16.541 --> 00:26:17.958
[sighs] Blast.

382
00:26:19.166 --> 00:26:22.083
Right. boys. Here we go. Come on together.

383
00:26:22.166 --> 00:26:24.541
Better have something to show
Mrs. Pretty when she get back.

384
00:26:24.625 --> 00:26:27.416
-[knocking on door]
-[Grateley] And the crystal glasses!

385
00:26:29.458 --> 00:26:31.208
No. no. no. Side door. please.

386
00:26:31.291 --> 00:26:34.416
-Mrs. Pretty back from London yet?
-Mrs. Pretty's about to dine.

387
00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:35.833
[Brown] I told you it was urgent.

388
00:26:35.916 --> 00:26:38.833
[Grateley] Mr. Brown. I'm sure
you wouldn't like to interfere with--

389
00:26:38.916 --> 00:26:40.583
[Pretty] It's all right. Mr. Grateley.

390
00:26:41.083 --> 00:26:44.041
-Is it Mr. Brown?
-[Pretty] Yes. darling. Darling

391
00:26:46.541 --> 00:26:48.541
I think you'd better come and see.

392
00:26:49.333 --> 00:26:51.333
[soaring orchestral music playing]

393
00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:07.416
[Brown] That's a ship.

394
00:27:09.375 --> 00:27:11.041
[Robert] How do you mean. a ship?

395
00:27:11.791 --> 00:27:14.916
[Brown] Oh. well. that's a ship
that's been buried in the mound.

396
00:27:15.958 --> 00:27:18.375
[Robert]
Why would anyone want to bury a ship?

397
00:27:18.458 --> 00:27:21.083
[Brown] Well.
I expect because that's a grave.

398
00:27:22.208 --> 00:27:23.375
[Robert] Whose grave?

399
00:27:23.875 --> 00:27:27.041
[Brown] Well. I'd expect
this is a grave of a… a great man.

400
00:27:27.791 --> 00:27:28.791
A warrior…

401
00:27:30.125 --> 00:27:31.208
or a king.

402
00:27:31.958 --> 00:27:37.125
They must have pulled his ship all the way
up that there hill from the river.

403
00:27:38.125 --> 00:27:42.208
Now. they'd have put it on ropes.
and they'd have hauled it over logs.

404
00:27:42.916 --> 00:27:47.083
Men. horses. It must have taken
hundreds of 'em. [chuckles]

405
00:27:47.166 --> 00:27:50.500
I don't expect them to go
to all this trouble for any little squirt.

406
00:27:51.208 --> 00:27:54.208
Can you imagine
the send-off they'd be giving him?

407
00:27:54.875 --> 00:27:57.500
The songs they'd be singing. [laughs]

408
00:27:57.583 --> 00:27:59.958
They'd have drunk Mr. Spooner
under the table.

409
00:28:00.041 --> 00:28:01.833
-[Brown and Pretty laugh]
-[Robert] Vikings?

410
00:28:01.916 --> 00:28:04.375
[sniffles] Well. I… I think that's older.

411
00:28:04.458 --> 00:28:07.791
Maynard disagrees.
but I think it's Anglo-Saxon.

412
00:28:08.458 --> 00:28:12.250
Now. this is your doing. John Jacobs.
'cause you found the first rivet.

413
00:28:12.333 --> 00:28:15.041
-[Jacobs chuckles]
-That's right. Mrs. Pretty. He did.

414
00:28:17.125 --> 00:28:18.791
Congratulations. Mr. Brown.

415
00:28:18.875 --> 00:28:21.666
[Brown chuckles] Well. you thought
there was something. didn't you?

416
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:23.250
I had my feeling.

417
00:28:23.333 --> 00:28:25.750
That you did. Mrs. Pretty. That you did.

418
00:28:25.833 --> 00:28:27.208
[Pretty] Oh. John.

419
00:28:27.291 --> 00:28:29.583
-Congratulations. Mr. Spooner.
-[Spooner] Thank you. ma'am.

420
00:28:29.666 --> 00:28:32.625
[Brown] We couldn't have done it
without this young man here.

421
00:28:34.375 --> 00:28:35.625
[kisses] Psst.

422
00:28:35.708 --> 00:28:37.791
[softly] Robert. a ship!

423
00:28:38.916 --> 00:28:39.791
[kisses]

424
00:28:40.916 --> 00:28:42.416
[Robert] Thank you. Mr. Brown.

425
00:28:43.208 --> 00:28:45.916
[Brown] Well.
there's a lot of earth to… to shift now.

426
00:28:47.166 --> 00:28:48.250
But who knows?

427
00:28:49.333 --> 00:28:51.791
I'm pretty sure it continues further.

428
00:29:02.041 --> 00:29:04.250
[music and sound fade]

429
00:29:10.916 --> 00:29:13.333
[wind blows softly]

430
00:29:20.125 --> 00:29:21.250
[hatch squeaks]

431
00:29:22.875 --> 00:29:24.083
[man] Evening.

432
00:29:24.666 --> 00:29:25.666
Evening.

433
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:27.208
[birds singing]

434
00:29:36.958 --> 00:29:38.666
[Reid Moir]
Do you realize what this means?

435
00:29:39.166 --> 00:29:41.125
It's going to change everything
for Ipswich.

436
00:29:41.625 --> 00:29:44.333
We'll be the envy
of every museum in the country.

437
00:29:47.333 --> 00:29:50.583
-You're gonna get wet. Mrs. Pretty.
-[Pretty] I'm afraid I already am.

438
00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:54.208
[Brown grunts]

439
00:29:54.291 --> 00:29:57.541
[Pretty] Mr. Reid Moir has kindly offered
to take charge of the dig.

440
00:29:59.583 --> 00:30:01.750
I turned his generous offer down.

441
00:30:02.541 --> 00:30:04.083
-You didn't.
-[Pretty] I did.

442
00:30:04.875 --> 00:30:06.583
[chuckles. splutters] What did he say?

443
00:30:07.166 --> 00:30:10.375
He said I couldn't keep it to myself.
which is true.

444
00:30:10.458 --> 00:30:12.708
[chuckling] I bet he blew his gasket.

445
00:30:12.791 --> 00:30:15.791
In the meantime. I've asked my cousin.
Rory Lomax. to come.

446
00:30:15.875 --> 00:30:18.833
-[Brown] Right.
-I can see you need another pair of hands.

447
00:30:18.916 --> 00:30:21.541
He's only an amateur.
but then. so is Mr. Reid Moir.

448
00:30:21.625 --> 00:30:23.666
-[both chuckle]
-[thunder rumbling]

449
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:26.583
-Mrs. Pretty. you better go in the shed.
-Oh. yes.

450
00:30:26.666 --> 00:30:29.208
-[Brown] You're gonna get very wet here.
-[Pretty] I will.

451
00:30:31.875 --> 00:30:33.875
[soothing instrumental music playing]

452
00:30:37.291 --> 00:30:38.375
[Brown sighs]

453
00:30:42.708 --> 00:30:44.250
[Brown panting]

454
00:30:44.333 --> 00:30:47.916
[Pretty] I wanted to thank you
for your patience with Robert.

455
00:30:48.416 --> 00:30:50.333
He can hardly wait to see you
in the mornings.

456
00:30:50.416 --> 00:30:52.916
[Brown] Well. keeps me on me toes.
having him around.

457
00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:54.625
Do you have children?

458
00:30:56.291 --> 00:30:58.916
No. uh. we. uh…

459
00:31:03.625 --> 00:31:04.708
No.

460
00:31:07.083 --> 00:31:08.250
[Brown sniffles]

461
00:31:09.166 --> 00:31:11.583
[Pretty] The servants tell me
you've studied everything.

462
00:31:11.666 --> 00:31:13.208
from Latin to geology.

463
00:31:13.791 --> 00:31:16.833
[Brown] Well. a little education
is a dangerous thing.

464
00:31:16.916 --> 00:31:18.916
[Pretty] Hmm.
Apparently. you've written a book.

465
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.041
[Brown] I have.

466
00:31:20.666 --> 00:31:23.708
A guide to astronomical maps and charts.

467
00:31:24.208 --> 00:31:27.500
to make them accessible to ordinary men.

468
00:31:28.708 --> 00:31:30.750
[Brown] I left school when I was 12.

469
00:31:31.875 --> 00:31:33.750
Always had a hunger to study.

470
00:31:36.958 --> 00:31:39.541
[Pretty] I got a place
at London University.

471
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:43.458
My father wouldn't hear of it.

472
00:31:54.791 --> 00:31:56.666
[birds singing]

473
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:58.291
Would you have dinner with me?

474
00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:03.583
Well… thank you. Yes.

475
00:32:06.875 --> 00:32:08.000
[Pretty exhales]

476
00:32:26.041 --> 00:32:27.166
[Brown] Evening. Vera.

477
00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:29.875
Surprise for you. Basil. in your room.

478
00:32:31.875 --> 00:32:32.708
[Brown] Right.

479
00:32:40.041 --> 00:32:40.958
May.

480
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:44.625
I brought you some fresh shirts.

481
00:32:45.166 --> 00:32:47.333
-[Brown chuckles]
-About time. I say.

482
00:32:50.625 --> 00:32:53.208
-Are you pleased to see me?
-Of course I am.

483
00:32:53.291 --> 00:32:55.125
[sighs. chuckles softly]

484
00:32:55.208 --> 00:32:58.666
-You didn't know I was coming. did you?
-[Brown] No. No. I didn't.

485
00:32:59.416 --> 00:33:00.583
I did tell you.

486
00:33:01.625 --> 00:33:03.000
In my last letter.

487
00:33:04.708 --> 00:33:07.250
[Brown] Oh.
I was saving them for the weekend.

488
00:33:07.333 --> 00:33:10.083
I've been working every hour.
You know what I'm like. [chuckles]

489
00:33:10.166 --> 00:33:12.750
Yes… I do.

490
00:33:16.458 --> 00:33:17.666
[Brown] I'm very busy.

491
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:21.291
-It looks like it. Nowhere to sit in here.
-[Brown] There's a lot going on here.

492
00:33:21.375 --> 00:33:23.708
-What's that?
-I said there's nowhere to sit down.

493
00:33:23.791 --> 00:33:26.166
[Brown] Yeah. Sorry about that.
It's all-- So much going on.

494
00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:28.166
You got something to show me?
I think you have.

495
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:29.708
I can see it in your eyes.

496
00:33:29.791 --> 00:33:31.208
I'm not saying anything.

497
00:33:31.291 --> 00:33:33.041
[indistinct chatter]

498
00:33:33.125 --> 00:33:35.458
[maid] There's Mr. Brown with a woman.

499
00:33:38.166 --> 00:33:41.416
I suppose it's his wife.
You know. she writes to him every day.

500
00:33:44.958 --> 00:33:45.958
[knocking on door]

501
00:33:46.041 --> 00:33:46.916
Come in.

502
00:33:50.583 --> 00:33:53.291
Mr. Brown sends his apologies. ma'am.

503
00:33:58.416 --> 00:34:01.375
That's all. Thank you. Ellen. [sighs]

504
00:34:03.708 --> 00:34:06.458
[Brown] A man could dig the earth
his whole life through

505
00:34:06.958 --> 00:34:09.375
and not find anything
like I've discovered here.

506
00:34:09.458 --> 00:34:12.666
-[May] She's beautiful. all right.
-[Brown] Yeah. she's beautiful.

507
00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:15.541
[May] You'll have to watch your back
with a thing like this.

508
00:34:15.625 --> 00:34:16.625
[Brown] What do you mean?

509
00:34:16.708 --> 00:34:19.916
[May] Everyone's gonna want a piece
of this here ship. and this is your find.

510
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:20.833
[Brown] Oh. May…

511
00:34:20.916 --> 00:34:23.291
[May] Don't let Ipswich Museum
take your glory.

512
00:34:23.375 --> 00:34:25.833
-[Brown] He's not gonna take--
-[May] Or that lady at the manor.

513
00:34:25.916 --> 00:34:28.416
-She should be upping your wages again.
-[Brown] She's supportive.

514
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.541
-[May] You asked?
-[Brown] I ain't gonna ask for more.

515
00:34:30.625 --> 00:34:32.958
[Brown] Well. she's very. very gracious.
Mrs. Pretty.

516
00:34:33.041 --> 00:34:36.125
[May] Your heart's lost
to this Viking maiden. I can tell.

517
00:34:37.208 --> 00:34:38.125
Innit?

518
00:34:39.208 --> 00:34:42.291
[Brown] Ah. May. you sure you don't want
to stay the night?

519
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.916
I'll miss my lift back.

520
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.583
[Brown] Right. yeah. um…

521
00:34:48.291 --> 00:34:50.916
Well. thanks for coming. May.

522
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.958
[sighs] I do miss you.

523
00:34:55.708 --> 00:34:58.583
-I've been reading your books for company.
-You haven't.

524
00:34:59.083 --> 00:35:00.750
-[May] I have.
-[scoffs]

525
00:35:00.833 --> 00:35:03.041
[laughing] Hell.
it's not much company. is it?

526
00:35:03.125 --> 00:35:06.000
-[May] No. they're hard work. I tell you.
-They are.

527
00:35:06.083 --> 00:35:08.000
[both laughing]

528
00:35:08.083 --> 00:35:10.083
Right. Well.
it's good of you to bring my shirts.

529
00:35:10.166 --> 00:35:12.583
-[May] Yeah.
-[Brown grunts]

530
00:35:12.666 --> 00:35:13.541
All right.

531
00:35:14.708 --> 00:35:16.500
[Brown] I'll read them letters tonight.

532
00:35:17.166 --> 00:35:18.791
-[May] Bye. then.
-[Brown] Bye.

533
00:35:19.291 --> 00:35:21.125
[engine rumbles]

534
00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:24.750
[Brown breathing deeply]

535
00:35:32.583 --> 00:35:35.208
-[thunder rumbles]
-[Brown gasps. sighs]

536
00:35:38.458 --> 00:35:39.708
Blast!

537
00:35:39.791 --> 00:35:41.333
[rain pattering]

538
00:35:46.916 --> 00:35:48.083
Ah!

539
00:35:48.166 --> 00:35:49.625
[groans]

540
00:35:51.708 --> 00:35:54.833
[grunting and panting]

541
00:35:58.666 --> 00:35:59.875
[grunts]

542
00:36:01.625 --> 00:36:03.291
-[strains]
-[young man yelps]

543
00:36:03.375 --> 00:36:04.500
[Brown gasps. grunts]

544
00:36:05.208 --> 00:36:07.250
-Let me help.
-[Brown] Right.

545
00:36:07.333 --> 00:36:10.916
Right. then.
Get around that side and take this tarp.

546
00:36:14.541 --> 00:36:17.791
That's… That's right. That's right.
There's a stake there behind you.

547
00:36:18.875 --> 00:36:19.750
Pull it hard.

548
00:36:22.458 --> 00:36:24.208
[Brown] Where in God's name
did you come from?

549
00:36:24.291 --> 00:36:25.708
[young man] I rode. actually.

550
00:36:25.791 --> 00:36:28.083
on my motorbike from Ipswich. [sniffles]

551
00:36:28.166 --> 00:36:29.625
I'm Rory Lomax.

552
00:36:29.708 --> 00:36:32.333
[Brown] Aye. Did Reid Moir send you?

553
00:36:33.208 --> 00:36:35.458
-From the museum?
-[thunder rumbles]

554
00:36:35.541 --> 00:36:37.416
I'm Edith Pretty's cousin.

555
00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:39.166
She telephoned. asked me to come.

556
00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:41.625
-Said you needed an extra pair of hands.
-All right.

557
00:36:41.708 --> 00:36:45.583
I pointed out my general lack of skill.
but she was undeterred.

558
00:36:46.708 --> 00:36:47.583
Right. Well…

559
00:36:47.666 --> 00:36:51.666
no doubt you'll hear
that my name is Brown. Basil Brown.

560
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:52.750
[Rory] Good to meet you.

561
00:36:52.833 --> 00:36:55.041
[Brown] Now.
it's gonna be raining for a while.

562
00:36:55.125 --> 00:36:57.375
so go on and take a seat. [sniffles]

563
00:36:57.458 --> 00:37:00.666
I expect you'd. uh. be wet.
coming from Ipswich on a motorbike.

564
00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:02.416
-[Rory] I was. rather.
-[Brown] Yeah.

565
00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:04.708
-[Rory] Just caught me at the end.
-[Brown] Right.

566
00:37:04.791 --> 00:37:07.625
Well. I'll light the stove.
Would you like some tea?

567
00:37:07.708 --> 00:37:09.083
[Rory chuckles] Yes. please.

568
00:37:09.166 --> 00:37:12.875
[Brown] I think we may have found. um.
an old. uh. Anglo-Saxon ship.

569
00:37:13.625 --> 00:37:16.666
When this rain clears tomorrow.
maybe you can see what we're doing.

570
00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:19.833
-Yeah?
-How very exciting.

571
00:37:20.333 --> 00:37:21.750
Yeah. it's all right.

572
00:37:23.041 --> 00:37:26.291
[thunder rumbles]

573
00:37:28.958 --> 00:37:31.208
-[Jacobs] Not gonna cover it.
-[Brown] Get the second tarp.

574
00:37:31.291 --> 00:37:33.000
-Pass me the hammer. please.
-[Jacobs] Right.

575
00:37:33.583 --> 00:37:34.625
[Spooner] All right. then.

576
00:37:35.833 --> 00:37:36.708
[Brown] Lift up.

577
00:37:36.791 --> 00:37:38.958
-[panting]
-[Brown] That's right.

578
00:37:39.041 --> 00:37:41.916
[indistinct chatter]

579
00:37:45.208 --> 00:37:46.125
Rory!

580
00:37:47.041 --> 00:37:48.208
Hello. Spud.

581
00:37:49.166 --> 00:37:51.333
[grunts] Arrived in the night.
Didn't want to wake you.

582
00:37:51.416 --> 00:37:52.333
Where's your mother?

583
00:37:52.416 --> 00:37:55.541
-[steam engine approaching]
-[Robert] Oh. she's gone to London.

584
00:37:55.625 --> 00:37:57.041
[train whistle blows]

585
00:37:57.125 --> 00:38:00.333
[passengers clamoring]

586
00:38:04.458 --> 00:38:06.666
[somber piano music playing]

587
00:38:13.791 --> 00:38:16.166
[man] Who knows
if we'll still be alive in a year?

588
00:38:19.708 --> 00:38:23.250
[announcer on loudspeaker]
The yellow and green balls denote gas.

589
00:38:23.333 --> 00:38:26.125
-Red denotes high explosives.
-[children laughing]

590
00:38:26.208 --> 00:38:29.166
[announcer]
Red stripes are incendiary bombs.

591
00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:32.708
If you are caught on the streets
during an air raid.

592
00:38:32.791 --> 00:38:37.333
you must know the appropriate response
to each form of attack.

593
00:38:38.083 --> 00:38:39.708
No. don't throw them about!

594
00:39:01.958 --> 00:39:03.958
[Pretty] I was rushing
to get here on time.

595
00:39:05.666 --> 00:39:07.416
Might that have affected the results?

596
00:39:08.541 --> 00:39:12.333
[doctor] Possibly. but the.
uh. underlying condition is there.

597
00:39:12.416 --> 00:39:15.750
The pneumatic fever
you had as a child. it. uh.

598
00:39:15.833 --> 00:39:17.833
damaged the valves of your heart.

599
00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:19.875
Irreparably. I'm afraid.

600
00:39:20.583 --> 00:39:23.958
Another attack
is likely to be much… more serious.

601
00:39:25.375 --> 00:39:26.666
Possibly even fatal.

602
00:39:27.833 --> 00:39:30.791
-Is there nothing else that can be done?
-[doctor] I'm sorry. I… I…

603
00:39:30.875 --> 00:39:32.375
I wish I had better news.

604
00:39:34.208 --> 00:39:35.958
[continues speaking indistinctly]

605
00:39:51.708 --> 00:39:52.916
[Pretty sighs deeply]

606
00:40:00.083 --> 00:40:02.541
[somber piano music swells]

607
00:40:02.625 --> 00:40:05.708
[bells tolling]

608
00:40:28.666 --> 00:40:31.250
[indistinct chatter]

609
00:40:59.833 --> 00:41:00.791
[parking brake clicks]

610
00:41:01.375 --> 00:41:03.958
[Grateley] Mr. Reid Moir is here. ma'am.
with some other gentlemen.

611
00:41:04.041 --> 00:41:05.791
They wouldn't stop to give me their names.

612
00:41:05.875 --> 00:41:07.625
Then they're trespassing. Where are they?

613
00:41:07.708 --> 00:41:09.708
-On their way to the mounds.
-Fetch them. quickly.

614
00:41:09.791 --> 00:41:12.166
-Right.
-[Pretty] Lyons?

615
00:41:16.083 --> 00:41:17.125
[sighs]

616
00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:21.500
[Brown] Now. I've been reading up
about the Oseberg Ship.

617
00:41:21.583 --> 00:41:24.375
That's a Viking ship they found in Norway.

618
00:41:24.875 --> 00:41:28.583
There was a burial chamber
in the center. roofed.

619
00:41:28.666 --> 00:41:31.250
It's a bit like we imagine Noah's Ark.

620
00:41:32.166 --> 00:41:34.833
Course. any roof here
would have caved in long ago.

621
00:41:35.833 --> 00:41:37.750
See. this line here.

622
00:41:37.833 --> 00:41:41.416
The ground is higher.
but this soil is darker.

623
00:41:41.916 --> 00:41:43.500
So you think there's something beneath?

624
00:41:44.291 --> 00:41:47.791
Well. we may know by the end of today.

625
00:41:47.875 --> 00:41:49.416
Ye gods!

626
00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:52.625
This is incredible!

627
00:41:53.125 --> 00:41:56.333
[Reid Moir] We at the Ipswich Museum
pride ourselves on our work.

628
00:41:56.416 --> 00:42:00.041
and I… I think you'll agree
that it's rock solid.

629
00:42:00.125 --> 00:42:03.458
-[Brown] You… You need to stop there.
-I beg your pardon?

630
00:42:03.541 --> 00:42:05.791
This is a very delicate site.
and it ain't safe.

631
00:42:05.875 --> 00:42:07.708
Uh. not for a man of your size.

632
00:42:10.291 --> 00:42:11.166
Is this your work?

633
00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:14.625
Uh. yes. I'm Basil Brown. excavator.

634
00:42:16.833 --> 00:42:20.375
[clears throat]
Well. Basil Brown. excavator…

635
00:42:21.166 --> 00:42:24.083
I am Charles Phillips. archaeologist.

636
00:42:24.833 --> 00:42:27.416
and I'm here to tell you that.

637
00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:30.458
as this is a find of national interest.

638
00:42:30.541 --> 00:42:33.791
the British Museum will be taking charge.

639
00:42:34.458 --> 00:42:35.458
Your work…

640
00:42:36.583 --> 00:42:38.541
looks. thankfully. decent.

641
00:42:39.333 --> 00:42:42.791
but your excavating service
is no longer required.

642
00:42:42.875 --> 00:42:47.166
Am… Am I to understand
that you will be personally taking over?

643
00:42:47.791 --> 00:42:50.791
Grimes.
I have never seen anything like it.

644
00:42:50.875 --> 00:42:52.666
-Quite. sir.
-Brailesford.

645
00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:55.416
-Sir.
-[Phillips] Cancel everything I've got.

646
00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:58.458
Find out who's free. We need Piggott.

647
00:42:58.541 --> 00:43:01.208
-Find us lodgings. as near as you can.
-[Brailesford] Yes. sir.

648
00:43:01.708 --> 00:43:04.583
[Reid Moir] That dark soil in the middle.
C.W.. looks very promising.

649
00:43:04.666 --> 00:43:08.250
You men. finish up.
and don't move another pebble!

650
00:43:08.333 --> 00:43:09.708
[Brown] Excuse me. Mr. Phillips.

651
00:43:09.791 --> 00:43:13.000
[splutters] I'm not employed by you.

652
00:43:13.083 --> 00:43:15.125
I'm employed by Mrs. Pretty.

653
00:43:15.208 --> 00:43:18.083
and I'll keep on working
until she tells me different.

654
00:43:18.166 --> 00:43:23.166
An ad hoc team from a provincial museum
cannot be left in charge.

655
00:43:23.875 --> 00:43:26.250
Mrs. Pretty must see that.

656
00:43:29.708 --> 00:43:30.833
[lock clicks]

657
00:43:30.916 --> 00:43:31.916
[doorbell ringing]

658
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.541
John. a minute is all I need.
I… I know she'll want to hear this.

659
00:43:35.625 --> 00:43:37.958
-All right. all right. Wait here.
-Right.

660
00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:42.750
[muttering softly]

661
00:43:43.833 --> 00:43:46.500
[Grateley] She'll see you tomorrow morning
at 10:30.

662
00:43:46.583 --> 00:43:48.375
She must know what I found.

663
00:43:48.458 --> 00:43:50.708
-[Grateley] Don't push it. old boy!
-[Brown] She must know!

664
00:43:50.791 --> 00:43:51.791
-[slams]
-[Brown] John!

665
00:43:52.375 --> 00:43:55.000
[door rattles. creaks open]

666
00:43:55.083 --> 00:43:56.333
[door closes]

667
00:43:56.416 --> 00:44:00.000
-Is he gone. Mr. Grateley?
-[Brown] It's not Grateley.

668
00:44:00.083 --> 00:44:01.541
[Pretty gasps]

669
00:44:01.625 --> 00:44:04.875
I… I'm sorry for disturbing you.
but I believe…

670
00:44:05.625 --> 00:44:08.625
we may have found
a burial chamber in the ship.

671
00:44:10.666 --> 00:44:14.041
-Does Mr. Phillips know?
-[Brown] I don't work for Mr. Phillips.

672
00:44:14.125 --> 00:44:15.458
What are your wishes?

673
00:44:21.125 --> 00:44:25.041
I. uh… He just informed me that.
by order of the Ministry of Works.

674
00:44:25.125 --> 00:44:27.250
the site must be placed under his control.

675
00:44:31.916 --> 00:44:33.083
Well. uh… [sighs]

676
00:44:34.833 --> 00:44:35.916
…that's that. then.

677
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.416
[sound fading]

678
00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:40.208
[Brown. muffled] Well. I…
I can carry on for one more day…

679
00:44:40.708 --> 00:44:41.875
if that's what you'd like.

680
00:44:41.958 --> 00:44:43.875
[somber instrumental music playing]

681
00:44:46.291 --> 00:44:48.458
Are… Are you poorly. Mrs. Pretty?

682
00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:51.500
Um… [sighs]

683
00:44:53.458 --> 00:44:54.791
Perhaps you might. um…

684
00:44:55.791 --> 00:44:57.208
might ring the bell for me.

685
00:44:57.958 --> 00:44:58.791
Right.

686
00:44:59.291 --> 00:45:00.500
[bell rings]

687
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.083
He's got no right to dictate to you.

688
00:45:03.583 --> 00:45:05.750
This ship's only appearing because of you.

689
00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:08.708
Don't forget why you wanted it begun.

690
00:45:09.208 --> 00:45:10.958
Now. you said that was a feeling.

691
00:45:11.041 --> 00:45:12.875
Your feeling is right.

692
00:45:12.958 --> 00:45:14.166
[door creaks open]

693
00:45:17.166 --> 00:45:20.875
-Mr. Brown seems to have found his way in.
-[Grateley] Mr. Brown.

694
00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:27.625
All right.

695
00:45:33.166 --> 00:45:35.166
[Pretty breathing shakily]

696
00:45:36.541 --> 00:45:38.416
[Grateley] Is there anything
I could bring you?

697
00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:39.958
Fetch Ellen for me. please.

698
00:45:43.916 --> 00:45:45.416
[sighs deeply]

699
00:45:54.916 --> 00:45:56.125
[sniffles]

700
00:45:57.833 --> 00:45:59.833
[somber music swells]

701
00:46:23.083 --> 00:46:24.083
[lighter clicks]

702
00:46:27.166 --> 00:46:28.500
[Pretty sighs]

703
00:46:32.333 --> 00:46:33.500
[exhales deeply]

704
00:46:43.708 --> 00:46:45.708
[wind whistles]

705
00:47:01.083 --> 00:47:03.750
[Phillips]
Mrs. Pretty is keen to keep you on.

706
00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:06.916
so we'll make good use of you.

707
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.166
Your primary task
will be to keep the site in order.

708
00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:15.750
So. I want the tumulus dug back
to an area of four feet on either side.

709
00:47:15.833 --> 00:47:18.708
and I want those spoil heaps removed.

710
00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:20.083
From now on.

711
00:47:20.166 --> 00:47:24.708
you're not to set foot in the body
of the ship without my express permission.

712
00:47:24.791 --> 00:47:25.791
Carry on.

713
00:47:26.791 --> 00:47:28.750
[Jacobs]
Are you gonna put up with that. Basil?

714
00:47:38.666 --> 00:47:39.583
[Brown sighs]

715
00:47:47.416 --> 00:47:48.750
[Robert] Hello. Mr. Brown.

716
00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:53.208
-My mother's got her heartburn.
-Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

717
00:47:53.291 --> 00:47:56.083
She has to have peace and quiet.
I made her this.

718
00:47:56.166 --> 00:47:59.958
-[Brown] Well. that's a very fine rocket.
-Where are you going?

719
00:48:00.041 --> 00:48:02.250
Oh. I… Oh. I have to go home now.

720
00:48:02.916 --> 00:48:04.375
When will you be back?

721
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:08.166
Well. uh… I'm sorry. Robert. I…

722
00:48:09.375 --> 00:48:10.333
I am.

723
00:48:14.333 --> 00:48:16.041
Uh. but. Mr. Brown…

724
00:48:16.541 --> 00:48:17.791
Mr. Brown!

725
00:48:19.375 --> 00:48:22.416
-Mr. Brown!
-[Rory] It seems I'm out of a job.

726
00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.833
[Rory] Phillips won't let us in his ship.

727
00:48:26.083 --> 00:48:28.125
His ship? Really?

728
00:48:28.708 --> 00:48:31.500
I thought I might take some photographs.
It could make a useful record.

729
00:48:31.583 --> 00:48:33.416
-Would you mind?
-Not at all.

730
00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:36.041
-As long as they're not of me.
-[camera clicks]

731
00:48:37.125 --> 00:48:38.750
Can't say I blame Brown.

732
00:48:38.833 --> 00:48:42.125
Such a decent man
doesn't deserve Phillips.

733
00:48:42.208 --> 00:48:43.458
Blame him?

734
00:48:43.541 --> 00:48:45.208
Well. he left this morning.
Didn't you know?

735
00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:47.875
Where's Robert?

736
00:48:50.208 --> 00:48:51.250
[water pours]

737
00:48:52.041 --> 00:48:54.041
[Robert panting]

738
00:48:59.250 --> 00:49:01.000
[horn blares]

739
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.750
You don't have another job?

740
00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:15.416
I'll write to Maynard.
and he'll give me something.

741
00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:19.666
[May]
Did you tell Mrs. Pretty you were leaving?

742
00:49:20.166 --> 00:49:22.375
[Brown]
I thought I'd let her work it out herself.

743
00:49:22.458 --> 00:49:23.625
And that's the thanks she gets

744
00:49:23.708 --> 00:49:25.708
for giving you the opportunity
in the first place?

745
00:49:25.791 --> 00:49:28.708
Mark my words. May.
I won't receive any credit.

746
00:49:28.791 --> 00:49:31.416
-I won't even be a footnote.
-[May] Is that why you took the job?

747
00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:32.833
-For credit?
-How can I stay on?

748
00:49:32.916 --> 00:49:35.416
Is that why you've been digging
your whole life for barely enough

749
00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:36.416
to cover our rent?

750
00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:39.708
No. May. I do it 'cause I'm good at it.

751
00:49:39.791 --> 00:49:42.750
'Cause that's what my father taught me.
and what his father taught him.

752
00:49:42.833 --> 00:49:46.000
'Cause you can show me a handful of soil
from anywhere in Suffolk.

753
00:49:46.083 --> 00:49:48.708
and I can pretty much tell you
whose land it's from.

754
00:49:48.791 --> 00:49:49.791
There you go.

755
00:49:51.291 --> 00:49:53.041
[gentle instrumental music playing]

756
00:49:53.791 --> 00:49:55.916
-[bicycle bell rings]
-[Robert panting]

757
00:49:56.416 --> 00:49:58.958
[Robert] Excuse me.
Do you know Basil Brown?

758
00:49:59.041 --> 00:50:01.250
-Do you know where he lives?
-Yes. I know Basil.

759
00:50:01.333 --> 00:50:03.666
He lives on a farm outside of the village.
Carry on that way.

760
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:04.875
Thank you so much.

761
00:50:11.416 --> 00:50:12.583
[groans]

762
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:29.208
I found that ship.

763
00:50:31.083 --> 00:50:35.083
I may not be a fellow at Cambridge.
but I worked out what was down there.

764
00:50:35.666 --> 00:50:39.208
And Jacobs and Spooner. too.
and nobody'll remember that.

765
00:50:39.291 --> 00:50:40.708
You don't know that.

766
00:50:41.583 --> 00:50:43.458
And if you're not around
to see it to the end.

767
00:50:43.541 --> 00:50:44.750
there's even less chance.

768
00:50:46.708 --> 00:50:49.750
You always told me your work
isn't about the past or even the present.

769
00:50:49.833 --> 00:50:51.000
It's for the future.

770
00:50:51.708 --> 00:50:55.541
So that the next generations
can know where they came from.

771
00:50:56.583 --> 00:50:58.833
The line
that joins them to their forebears.

772
00:50:58.916 --> 00:51:00.333
Isn't that what you always say?

773
00:51:03.958 --> 00:51:05.416
Yeah. something like that.

774
00:51:05.916 --> 00:51:08.208
[May] Why else would the lot of you
be playing in the dirt

775
00:51:08.291 --> 00:51:10.708
while the rest of the country
prepares for war?

776
00:51:12.291 --> 00:51:14.791
-Because that means something. innit?
-[Brown sighs]

777
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:19.416
Something that'll last longer
than whatever damn war we're heading into.

778
00:51:24.041 --> 00:51:25.166
Good hell.

779
00:51:26.333 --> 00:51:27.416
That's Robert.

780
00:51:28.291 --> 00:51:29.791
-Robert?
-[Robert panting]

781
00:51:30.291 --> 00:51:31.875
-[bicycle brakes squeak]
-Robert!

782
00:51:32.375 --> 00:51:33.625
[Robert] Mr. Brown!

783
00:51:34.166 --> 00:51:37.000
[Brown]
Robert. have you cycled all this way?

784
00:51:37.083 --> 00:51:38.083
You promised.

785
00:51:38.958 --> 00:51:39.916
May! May!

786
00:51:40.375 --> 00:51:43.541
You said you'd show me the cosmos.
You promised.

787
00:51:43.625 --> 00:51:46.791
-Good heavens! Who have we here?
-[Brown] This is Robert Pretty.

788
00:51:46.875 --> 00:51:48.166
[May] Robert. I'm Mrs. Brown.

789
00:51:49.041 --> 00:51:51.458
I bet you have a rare thirst
after that long ride. don't you?

790
00:51:51.541 --> 00:51:53.583
-[Robert] Mm-hmm.
-Come you here.

791
00:51:53.666 --> 00:51:55.958
-Let's get you a cup of milk.
-[Brown] That's a long way.

792
00:51:56.041 --> 00:51:57.666
Does your mother know you're here. Robert?

793
00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:59.916
-[May] How'd you find your way?
-She know you cycled?

794
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.541
-[May] Should I take your bike for you?
-[Robert] Yes. please.

795
00:52:02.625 --> 00:52:04.916
I better find a telephone. May.
Call Mrs. Pretty.

796
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.875
[car approaching]

797
00:52:15.833 --> 00:52:16.666
[Brown] Ah.

798
00:52:17.625 --> 00:52:19.583
-[Pretty] Thank you.
-[Brown] He's all right.

799
00:52:19.666 --> 00:52:22.666
-He's inside. Uh. come this way.
-[Pretty] Thank you.

800
00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:25.125
-We were obviously very worried.
-Yes. He's… He's…

801
00:52:25.208 --> 00:52:27.250
Uh. this is May. my wife.

802
00:52:27.333 --> 00:52:29.458
-Mrs. Pretty.
-Thank you very much.

803
00:52:30.041 --> 00:52:32.833
He's been no trouble. A lovely boy.

804
00:52:33.375 --> 00:52:35.458
Mrs. Brown has a music box from Whitby

805
00:52:35.541 --> 00:52:37.666
covered in all manner of shells.

806
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:38.875
Would you like to see?

807
00:52:38.958 --> 00:52:42.083
Uh. no.
We've imposed on your kindness enough.

808
00:52:42.583 --> 00:52:44.166
What were you thinking?

809
00:52:45.291 --> 00:52:47.125
You could have been lost or killed.

810
00:52:47.208 --> 00:52:51.416
-Robert… what were you thinking?
-[Robert] I'm sorry. Mother.

811
00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:54.875
Uh. Robert came to remind me
of a promise that I made.

812
00:52:55.375 --> 00:52:58.458
I said I'd show him the stars
through my telescope.

813
00:52:59.125 --> 00:53:00.041
Didn't I?

814
00:53:00.833 --> 00:53:02.125
Then you're returning?

815
00:53:03.333 --> 00:53:05.291
I am. Yes.

816
00:53:09.958 --> 00:53:11.416
Thank you. [sighs]

817
00:53:22.375 --> 00:53:23.208
[Rory] Morning!

818
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:24.875
[Brown] Morning.

819
00:53:24.958 --> 00:53:29.458
Mr. Grimes. I've been. uh… taking notes.

820
00:53:30.541 --> 00:53:32.333
-Ah!
-If they be of any use.

821
00:53:32.416 --> 00:53:34.291
Why. they'd save me days.

822
00:53:35.916 --> 00:53:39.500
-You must have suspected what was here.
-[Brown] Well. you've made good progress.

823
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.166
[Grimes] As did you.

824
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:43.250
Thank you kindly.

825
00:53:43.333 --> 00:53:46.708
-[Grimes] It's fine work. Mr. Brown.
-[Brown] Yeah. Well. we made a start.

826
00:53:47.291 --> 00:53:50.541
-Phillips.
-[Phillips] Our excavator has returned.

827
00:53:50.625 --> 00:53:51.458
[Brown] Morning.

828
00:53:51.541 --> 00:53:53.541
[Phillips] There's a sign
in the bottom of the ship

829
00:53:53.625 --> 00:53:56.125
that there could be an intact chamber.

830
00:53:56.208 --> 00:53:57.916
[Piggott] Tremendously exciting.

831
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:01.166
[warplanes roaring overhead]

832
00:54:03.625 --> 00:54:04.791
[Phillips grunts]

833
00:54:04.875 --> 00:54:07.208
[Piggott] What about events
in the wider world. C.W.?

834
00:54:07.708 --> 00:54:09.166
How do you think it will affect us?

835
00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:11.250
[Phillips] Judging by last night's news…

836
00:54:12.166 --> 00:54:14.833
I think we could be at war
in a matter of weeks.

837
00:54:15.333 --> 00:54:18.166
and every excavation
in the land will stop.

838
00:54:18.666 --> 00:54:21.916
-So. it's up to us. [clears throat]
-[Piggott sighs]

839
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.666
-Oh. good lord. [gasps]
-Gosh.

840
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:28.250
-[Piggott] Jim! Billy Grimes!
-Stuart!

841
00:54:28.333 --> 00:54:30.416
-How the devil are you?
-[Piggott chuckles] Very well.

842
00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:33.625
-This is my wife. Margaret.
-Peggy.

843
00:54:33.708 --> 00:54:35.916
[Brailesford] Mrs. Piggott.
a pleasure to meet you.

844
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.541
[Peggy] Mr. Phillips. I-- um.
I wanted to say how pleased I was

845
00:54:39.625 --> 00:54:41.291
that you specifically asked
for me to come.

846
00:54:41.375 --> 00:54:43.875
I know Stuart sent you my paper
on Bosnian Lake villagers.

847
00:54:43.958 --> 00:54:46.500
It was awfully good of you to read it.

848
00:54:48.083 --> 00:54:50.500
Ah. yes. Um. very stimulating.

849
00:54:50.583 --> 00:54:54.000
[Peggy chuckles] I hope
I'll be able to repay your faith in me.

850
00:54:54.083 --> 00:54:55.458
[Phillips] I have no doubt.

851
00:54:55.541 --> 00:54:58.458
It's just that I haven't done
much actual fieldwork yet.

852
00:54:58.541 --> 00:55:01.833
Uh. so I wouldn't want you to think
I'm more experienced than I really am.

853
00:55:01.916 --> 00:55:04.875
[Phillips]
Ah. you have all the key attributes.

854
00:55:05.833 --> 00:55:06.833
[Peggy] Do I?

855
00:55:06.916 --> 00:55:08.875
-This ship is very delicate.
-[Peggy] Mm-hmm.

856
00:55:08.958 --> 00:55:12.291
One could say. it.
um. scarcely exists at all.

857
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.083
Too much weight. it disintegrates.

858
00:55:15.166 --> 00:55:20.416
You're probably less than nine stone.
so I'll supervise from here

859
00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:23.458
while you light things
get on with the digging.

860
00:55:25.666 --> 00:55:28.208
Am I to understand
you only asked for me because of my size?

861
00:55:28.291 --> 00:55:30.000
Uh. lucky guess. actually.

862
00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:34.041
[chuckles] Yeah. thank God
Piggott didn't marry a piglet.

863
00:55:34.125 --> 00:55:36.583
[group laughs]

864
00:55:36.666 --> 00:55:38.208
[Phillips] Carry on!

865
00:55:38.291 --> 00:55:40.291
[somber instrumental music playing]

866
00:55:49.833 --> 00:55:53.000
-[Phillips] How does it look to you?
-[Brailesford] Sir?

867
00:55:54.125 --> 00:55:56.291
-[camera clicks]
-[crew chattering]

868
00:56:00.625 --> 00:56:02.291
[Phillips] What have you got there?

869
00:56:02.375 --> 00:56:03.458
[camera clicks]

870
00:56:06.041 --> 00:56:10.000
-[seagulls crying]
-[Robert imitating weaponry firing]

871
00:56:15.375 --> 00:56:16.625
[camera clicks]

872
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.291
[Brailesford] All right. then.

873
00:56:32.041 --> 00:56:33.291
[camera clicks]

874
00:56:38.083 --> 00:56:39.500
[indistinct chatter]

875
00:56:40.375 --> 00:56:43.625
-[Piggott] First round's on me. chaps!
-[Phillips] Very nice of you.

876
00:56:43.708 --> 00:56:46.125
[group continues chattering indistinctly]

877
00:56:54.666 --> 00:56:56.000
[Peggy laughing]

878
00:56:57.500 --> 00:56:59.750
[coughs] Do they not have a… a double?

879
00:56:59.833 --> 00:57:02.250
[Piggott] Sorry. darling. no.
This is fine. though. isn't it?

880
00:57:02.333 --> 00:57:05.166
We don't…
We don't want to start by making a fuss.

881
00:57:05.250 --> 00:57:07.000
Oh. no. Of course not.

882
00:57:08.541 --> 00:57:11.375
We're so lucky to be part of this. [sighs]

883
00:57:12.208 --> 00:57:13.041
[Peggy] Yes.

884
00:57:13.916 --> 00:57:17.166
-[exhales] Yes. it's going to be amazing.
-Mm.

885
00:57:20.875 --> 00:57:22.000
[exhales]

886
00:57:22.625 --> 00:57:24.625
Would you prefer this bed…

887
00:57:25.791 --> 00:57:27.291
or… or… or that one?

888
00:57:27.375 --> 00:57:29.250
I'll… I'll take this one. shall I?

889
00:57:30.916 --> 00:57:31.791
[Peggy sighs]

890
00:57:33.458 --> 00:57:37.958
[Brown] You need to find a star
and identify its direction of travel.

891
00:57:38.625 --> 00:57:41.541
-Good evening. gentlemen.
-[Brown] Good evening. Mrs. Pretty.

892
00:57:42.375 --> 00:57:44.583
-Hello. Mother.
-[Pretty] Hello. darling.

893
00:57:44.666 --> 00:57:45.958
Ah!

894
00:57:47.125 --> 00:57:49.625
[Robert]
Do space pilots navigate using the stars?

895
00:57:49.708 --> 00:57:51.583
[Brown] Oh. most certainly. they do.

896
00:57:53.916 --> 00:57:56.916
Ten more minutes. Commander. Then. bed.

897
00:57:57.958 --> 00:57:59.958
[dramatic orchestral music playing]

898
00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:09.750
[Robert] I see a star.

899
00:58:11.166 --> 00:58:13.875
[group singing indistinctly]

900
00:58:26.291 --> 00:58:28.291
[birds singing]

901
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:32.833
[Brown] All right.

902
00:58:34.958 --> 00:58:37.625
[Peggy grunting]

903
00:58:38.333 --> 00:58:39.500
[screams]

904
00:58:39.583 --> 00:58:41.666
-Oh. God!
-[Phillips] What's going on?

905
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:44.333
-[Peggy] It just gave way.
-[Phillips] Get her off there!

906
00:58:44.416 --> 00:58:46.916
-Piggott. get her off!
-Oh. I'm so sorry!

907
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.666
-I didn't mean to damage anything.
-[Piggott sighs] Oh. you…

908
00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:52.083
-What you got. Brailesford?
-[Brown] You all right?

909
00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000
[Brailesford] Sort of rusted lumps.

910
00:58:55.083 --> 00:58:56.916
[Phillips] Come on. man.
Where's your training?

911
00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.041
[Brailesford] Uh. an amorphous mass
of corroded objects. sir.

912
00:59:00.583 --> 00:59:03.541
You. get your camera down there.
Photograph it.

913
00:59:03.625 --> 00:59:05.791
That's… That's very hot in the full sun.

914
00:59:05.875 --> 00:59:08.458
Oh. I'm fine. Thank you.

915
00:59:08.958 --> 00:59:12.250
Watch your step there.
This could well be our chamber.

916
00:59:13.291 --> 00:59:14.958
[Pretty] Some barley water. Mrs. Piggott?

917
00:59:15.041 --> 00:59:18.708
-[sighs] Thank you. So clumsy.
-[Pretty] Oh. not at all.

918
00:59:19.666 --> 00:59:22.125
-[flies buzzing]
-[Peggy exhales] Oh.

919
00:59:22.208 --> 00:59:24.041
-That's a very lovely skirt.
-[Peggy] Oh.

920
00:59:24.125 --> 00:59:28.541
[chuckles] Completely useless.
I don't have anything more suitable.

921
00:59:28.625 --> 00:59:31.083
-We came straight from our holiday.
-Did you really?

922
00:59:31.166 --> 00:59:33.750
-[Peggy chuckles] Yes.
-[Pretty] Well. come to the house.

923
00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:35.916
Let's see what we can find.

924
00:59:39.666 --> 00:59:41.333
Is Mrs. Pretty still poorly?

925
00:59:44.125 --> 00:59:46.833
She says she's perfectly fine. but…

926
00:59:47.666 --> 00:59:49.333
[whispering] …that's typical of her.

927
00:59:51.791 --> 00:59:54.250
[men hollering. laughing]

928
00:59:54.333 --> 00:59:56.041
Damn this weather.

929
00:59:57.291 --> 00:59:59.125
Losing a whole day.

930
01:00:00.041 --> 01:00:03.791
So little time before world events…

931
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.208
confound us.

932
01:00:06.291 --> 01:00:07.916
[men continue laughing]

933
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.833
[Phillips] It's a race. an absolute race.

934
01:00:11.875 --> 01:00:14.666
[Pretty] Then you are wasting
the talents of Mr. Brown.

935
01:00:15.791 --> 01:00:17.625
Well. that's an excellent idea.

936
01:00:18.125 --> 01:00:21.875
Stuart couldn't fault his work.
Could he not be unearthing the stern?

937
01:00:22.375 --> 01:00:24.416
[Phillips] Mr. Brown isn't qualified.

938
01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:27.625
Well. that's just snobbery.
isn't it. Mr. Phillips?

939
01:00:30.375 --> 01:00:33.625
[Brailesford and Piggott
chuckling and chatting]

940
01:00:34.375 --> 01:00:36.000
-[Phillips] Brown!
-[Peggy clears throat]

941
01:00:37.958 --> 01:00:38.875
[Phillips] Brown!

942
01:00:40.083 --> 01:00:41.875
Brown. come here. man!

943
01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:52.750
[footsteps approaching]

944
01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:56.041
[Piggott gasps] Oh my God. Margaret.

945
01:00:59.708 --> 01:01:00.666
[Peggy sighs]

946
01:01:02.083 --> 01:01:03.291
[exhales]

947
01:01:03.375 --> 01:01:04.875
Sorry. I forgot to lock the door.

948
01:01:04.958 --> 01:01:08.416
[chuckles] No. you see.
we… we… we share that bathroom

949
01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:12.500
with… with four other rooms.
and. you know. I could have been anyone.

950
01:01:12.583 --> 01:01:15.916
-Um. I could've been Grimes or Phillips.
-[Peggy scoffs]

951
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.500
But you're not. You're my husband.

952
01:01:17.583 --> 01:01:20.458
[chuckles] Yes.
but how… how do you think I'd feel

953
01:01:20.541 --> 01:01:22.583
if… if one of them saw you in that state?

954
01:01:22.666 --> 01:01:26.125
[scoffs] Oh! In what state?

955
01:01:26.208 --> 01:01:27.875
[laughs]

956
01:01:27.958 --> 01:01:29.750
[giggles] In this state?

957
01:01:30.833 --> 01:01:32.625
Christ. I-- Stop.

958
01:01:32.708 --> 01:01:35.208
You should be more careful. It's…

959
01:01:35.291 --> 01:01:40.416
You know. now. after… after waiting eons.
I shall… I shall go and have my bath.

960
01:01:41.708 --> 01:01:44.958
[door opens. closes]

961
01:01:46.458 --> 01:01:47.458
[Peggy sighs]

962
01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:54.875
[birds chirping]

963
01:02:06.208 --> 01:02:08.333
-[Grimes] Mr. Spooner.
-[Spooner] Right.

964
01:02:16.083 --> 01:02:18.541
-Morning. Mr. Piggott.
-[chuckles nervously] C.W.

965
01:02:21.666 --> 01:02:22.583
[sighs]

966
01:02:22.666 --> 01:02:26.083
-[whispers] You might have woken me.
-I didn't like to.

967
01:02:27.333 --> 01:02:28.750
You made me appear late.

968
01:02:33.625 --> 01:02:37.125
-[Pretty reading indistinctly]
-[crew chattering and laughing]

969
01:02:38.333 --> 01:02:41.750
[Piggott whispering] Careful. Stuart.
You've got a delicate line now. man.

970
01:02:41.833 --> 01:02:43.458
-Very delicate.
-You ready?

971
01:02:43.541 --> 01:02:44.791
-Yeah.
-[Phillips] Just a moment.

972
01:02:44.875 --> 01:02:47.791
You have to be very careful now.
No cavalier lifting.

973
01:02:47.875 --> 01:02:49.666
[both laughing]

974
01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:51.125
-[Phillips] Very gently.
-Yes. sir.

975
01:02:51.208 --> 01:02:55.291
[Phillips] On my count. One. two. three.

976
01:02:56.041 --> 01:02:57.958
[softly] And we do it this way.

977
01:03:11.708 --> 01:03:12.750
[Peggy gasps]

978
01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:16.083
[Rory] Don't move.

979
01:03:16.166 --> 01:03:17.166
[camera clicks]

980
01:03:19.916 --> 01:03:23.416
-[Peggy breathing shakily]
-[Brailesford] Piggott. look.

981
01:03:27.125 --> 01:03:29.291
[dramatic instrumental music playing]

982
01:03:29.875 --> 01:03:33.666
[Piggott] Where did you find it. darling?
You clever girl.

983
01:03:35.791 --> 01:03:36.791
Phillips!

984
01:03:40.083 --> 01:03:43.333
-Look at this. sir.
-Look. Look!

985
01:03:44.083 --> 01:03:45.916
-[Phillips] Ah. good Lord.
-[Piggott] His face!

986
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.333
[crew laughing]

987
01:03:47.416 --> 01:03:48.416
Phillips.

988
01:03:49.208 --> 01:03:52.125
-Mrs. Pretty. there's more.
-[Brown] And here. And here too.

989
01:03:53.125 --> 01:03:54.541
[Peggy] There's much more.

990
01:03:55.666 --> 01:03:58.250
[energetic instrumental music playing]

991
01:04:09.041 --> 01:04:11.041
[crew chatting indistinctly]

992
01:04:28.333 --> 01:04:30.791
[excited chatter]

993
01:04:30.875 --> 01:04:33.791
[Brown] Could you both. uh.
cast your eyes on this. please?

994
01:04:34.875 --> 01:04:37.500
I. uh. found it down between the strikes.

995
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.791
I believe that's a Merovingian tremissis.

996
01:04:40.875 --> 01:04:43.583
-Late 6th century.
-[Phillips scoffs] Can't be.

997
01:04:44.416 --> 01:04:48.791
Viking East Anglia didn't have
a coin-based economy till the 9th century.

998
01:04:48.875 --> 01:04:52.291
[Brown] Well.
I think that the ship is older.

999
01:04:52.375 --> 01:04:54.000
Mr. Brown has always said so.

1000
01:05:05.333 --> 01:05:06.708
This is Anglo-Saxon.

1001
01:05:08.333 --> 01:05:10.208
Piggott! Grimes!

1002
01:05:10.291 --> 01:05:12.791
It's Dark Age. by Jupiter!

1003
01:05:12.875 --> 01:05:14.250
Sixth century!

1004
01:05:14.333 --> 01:05:16.583
This changes everything.

1005
01:05:16.666 --> 01:05:20.875
These people
were not just marauding barterers.

1006
01:05:20.958 --> 01:05:22.375
They had culture!

1007
01:05:23.125 --> 01:05:24.125
They had art!

1008
01:05:24.708 --> 01:05:26.125
They had money!

1009
01:05:26.208 --> 01:05:27.833
[Grimes] Well. Vikings are out the window.

1010
01:05:27.916 --> 01:05:28.750
[Piggott gasps]

1011
01:05:28.833 --> 01:05:30.875
-C.W.. look.
-[Peggy] God's sake.

1012
01:05:30.958 --> 01:05:32.208
Oh. good God.

1013
01:05:32.291 --> 01:05:34.000
[crew laughing]

1014
01:05:34.083 --> 01:05:38.791
[Phillips] Brown has just shown me
a Merovingian tremissis.

1015
01:05:39.541 --> 01:05:40.666
[Piggott exclaims]

1016
01:05:41.416 --> 01:05:43.333
-[crew laughs]
-That's Anglo-Saxon.

1017
01:05:43.416 --> 01:05:45.750
[Phillips] It's incredible!

1018
01:05:51.583 --> 01:05:52.541
[blows]

1019
01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.041
[camera clicks]

1020
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.500
[birds singing]

1021
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:06.958
[Peggy] Hello.

1022
01:06:07.041 --> 01:06:08.541
Are you camping out here?

1023
01:06:09.708 --> 01:06:12.125
[Robert]
No. That's where my cousin Rory sleeps.

1024
01:06:12.958 --> 01:06:14.583
[Peggy] Is he not allowed indoors?

1025
01:06:15.666 --> 01:06:18.458
[Robert] No. he…
he thinks the house is too hot.

1026
01:06:19.083 --> 01:06:22.333
-[Peggy chuckles] I can imagine.
-[Robert] He's going to join the RAF.

1027
01:06:22.875 --> 01:06:25.500
-Is he?
-They're sending his papers any day.

1028
01:06:25.583 --> 01:06:27.250
He's going to get his wings.

1029
01:06:27.958 --> 01:06:28.833
Huh.

1030
01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:37.000
Well done. everybody.
on a splendid effort.

1031
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:39.208
Brailesford. Piggott.

1032
01:06:39.708 --> 01:06:42.083
if you'll start loading the gold
into the car.

1033
01:06:42.166 --> 01:06:44.083
we'll get it
straight to the British Museum.

1034
01:06:44.166 --> 01:06:45.791
[Pretty] I beg your pardon?

1035
01:06:45.875 --> 01:06:47.500
[seagulls crying]

1036
01:06:47.583 --> 01:06:50.625
Well. it's the obvious place for it.
Mrs. Pretty.

1037
01:06:52.875 --> 01:06:55.291
[Pretty]
London is preparing for air raids.

1038
01:06:55.791 --> 01:06:58.958
The British Museum is currently
being emptied of its treasures. isn't it?

1039
01:06:59.041 --> 01:07:02.250
[Phillips] Uh. yes.
but. um. it… it'll go to the lab.

1040
01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:05.583
[Pretty] This treasure came
from someone's grave.

1041
01:07:06.708 --> 01:07:10.041
There'll be an inquest. as you know.
and its fate will be decided there.

1042
01:07:10.833 --> 01:07:12.333
Until then. Mr. Brown…

1043
01:07:13.416 --> 01:07:15.000
as the finder of this magnificent ship.

1044
01:07:15.083 --> 01:07:17.166
would you please take the treasure
up to the house?

1045
01:07:17.666 --> 01:07:19.083
Uh. yes. Mrs. Pretty.

1046
01:07:19.166 --> 01:07:20.666
Thank you all very much.

1047
01:07:21.375 --> 01:07:26.000
[Brown] Right. uh. gentlemen.
I'll need some assistance. Mr. Lomax?

1048
01:07:26.083 --> 01:07:27.875
[Phillips] This is most irregular.

1049
01:07:28.458 --> 01:07:30.625
[Grimes] It all belongs to Mrs. Pretty.
doesn't it?

1050
01:07:30.708 --> 01:07:32.208
It's found on her land.

1051
01:07:32.291 --> 01:07:34.375
[Piggott] Well. surely.
the inquest will decide

1052
01:07:34.458 --> 01:07:37.166
whether the treasure
belongs to Mrs. Pretty or the Crown.

1053
01:07:37.250 --> 01:07:40.333
[Phillips] Piggott. do you want
this treasure to go to the Ipswich Museum?

1054
01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:43.041
[Pretty] Am I doing the right thing?

1055
01:07:44.625 --> 01:07:46.000
It's someone's grave.

1056
01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:51.000
[Brown] No. that's…
that's life what's revealed.

1057
01:07:52.291 --> 01:07:53.791
And that's why we dig.

1058
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.208
[Pretty] Just in here.
I think that's best.

1059
01:08:23.166 --> 01:08:25.500
They're like emissaries
from another world.

1060
01:08:33.166 --> 01:08:36.083
[Rory] I used to camp
with Robert's father. you see.

1061
01:08:36.166 --> 01:08:39.083
[Rory] I remember him telling me the calls
of all the birds.

1062
01:08:39.583 --> 01:08:42.791
Now. whenever I hear nightingales.
I think of these woods.

1063
01:08:42.875 --> 01:08:45.583
-[Peggy] Are there nightingales?
-Haven't you heard them?

1064
01:08:45.666 --> 01:08:46.666
[Peggy] No.

1065
01:08:47.666 --> 01:08:51.125
Never heard a nightingale at all.
Only on the wireless.

1066
01:08:51.625 --> 01:08:54.500
There's a wonderful cellist
called Beatrice Harrison.

1067
01:08:54.583 --> 01:08:57.750
In the summer evenings.
she used to practice in the garden. and…

1068
01:08:58.250 --> 01:09:01.708
one night. she was playing a scale.
and a… a nightingale joined in.

1069
01:09:02.791 --> 01:09:05.250
At first. she couldn't believe it.
She started playing a sonata.

1070
01:09:05.333 --> 01:09:08.041
and the nightingale accompanied her.

1071
01:09:08.791 --> 01:09:10.333
-[Rory] Really?
-[Peggy] Mm-hmm. Yes.

1072
01:09:10.416 --> 01:09:13.333
[chuckles] Yes. It happened again
the next night and next night.

1073
01:09:13.416 --> 01:09:14.916
Miss Harrison was so excited about it.

1074
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.791
she went to the BBC
and told them all about it.

1075
01:09:16.875 --> 01:09:17.708
[Rory] And?

1076
01:09:17.791 --> 01:09:20.000
[Peggy] So. a few evenings later.

1077
01:09:20.083 --> 01:09:22.291
the BBC came
and put their recording equipment

1078
01:09:22.375 --> 01:09:23.875
in Miss Harrison's garden.

1079
01:09:24.375 --> 01:09:28.916
She started to play.
and they waited and. um. waited…

1080
01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:31.125
and…

1081
01:09:32.250 --> 01:09:35.000
and at last.
the nightingale began to sing.

1082
01:09:37.416 --> 01:09:39.791
Went on for about 15 minutes…

1083
01:09:40.666 --> 01:09:42.875
rising and falling with the cello.

1084
01:09:45.416 --> 01:09:47.333
-No.
-[both laughing]

1085
01:09:47.416 --> 01:09:48.791
-Yes.
-Wow.

1086
01:09:49.541 --> 01:09:51.291
I know. Hmm.

1087
01:09:53.458 --> 01:09:54.500
[sighs]

1088
01:09:55.583 --> 01:09:59.958
But…
the really extraordinary thing is that…

1089
01:10:00.833 --> 01:10:05.000
other people who'd been listening
to the broadcast in their gardens

1090
01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:09.625
reported that other nightingales
also started to sing.

1091
01:10:10.625 --> 01:10:11.958
Well. that's wonderful.

1092
01:10:13.833 --> 01:10:16.750
Yes. it was. It was wonderful.

1093
01:10:16.833 --> 01:10:17.791
[Piggott] Margaret!

1094
01:10:19.583 --> 01:10:22.375
-Come on!
-[Peggy sighs] All right. Hmm.

1095
01:10:26.583 --> 01:10:29.416
Well… good night.

1096
01:10:31.875 --> 01:10:34.291
I shall listen out
for cellos in the woods.

1097
01:10:35.125 --> 01:10:36.166
[Peggy chuckles]

1098
01:10:37.083 --> 01:10:38.000
[Rory scoffs]

1099
01:10:39.041 --> 01:10:40.083
"Cellos." [mumbles]

1100
01:10:46.375 --> 01:10:49.083
[crowd chattering]

1101
01:10:58.333 --> 01:11:01.500
-[Brailesford] Here we are. chaps.
-[Phillips] All right.

1102
01:11:01.583 --> 01:11:03.666
[Brailesford] Well.
we are unburying a legend.

1103
01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:06.166
-Beowulf.
-Arthur. King of the Britons.

1104
01:11:06.250 --> 01:11:07.291
Cheers.

1105
01:11:07.375 --> 01:11:11.291
Talk about Dark Ages.
I can hardly see my pint.

1106
01:11:11.375 --> 01:11:12.750
What actually is that?

1107
01:11:12.833 --> 01:11:15.083
[Piggott] It's the.
uh. trial blackouts. C.W.

1108
01:11:15.166 --> 01:11:16.333
[Phillips] Ah.

1109
01:11:16.416 --> 01:11:19.875
So Germans will be coming by air
this time. will they?

1110
01:11:20.791 --> 01:11:22.916
Last time. they came by the river.

1111
01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.250
In AD 600.

1112
01:11:24.333 --> 01:11:26.875
[group laughing]

1113
01:11:26.958 --> 01:11:29.708
You know. I'm…
It's been a big day. I'm quite done in.

1114
01:11:29.791 --> 01:11:31.625
Um. will you all excuse me?

1115
01:11:31.708 --> 01:11:34.833
-Aw.
-Well done. Mrs. P. on a marvelous find.

1116
01:11:34.916 --> 01:11:36.791
[Brailesford] Yes.
Cheers to your clever wife!

1117
01:11:36.875 --> 01:11:39.291
-Yeah. No. I'll come with you. darling.
-No.

1118
01:11:39.375 --> 01:11:42.625
No. no. Um. surely you want to celebrate.

1119
01:11:42.708 --> 01:11:47.583
-Stay for another. Piggott.
-My round. Set them up again. would you?

1120
01:11:47.666 --> 01:11:52.291
I say. C.W.. ask him
if he'll take a Merovingian tremissis.

1121
01:11:52.375 --> 01:11:54.541
[group laughing]

1122
01:11:54.625 --> 01:11:56.458
[radio announcer] …the press campaign.

1123
01:11:56.541 --> 01:12:00.416
the menacing statements of the statesmen
leading the policy of Germany.

1124
01:12:00.916 --> 01:12:03.791
the systematic provocation
of frontier incidents.

1125
01:12:03.875 --> 01:12:06.958
and finally.
the constantly increasing concentrations

1126
01:12:07.041 --> 01:12:08.541
of mobilized armed forces

1127
01:12:08.625 --> 01:12:13.000
at the Polish frontiers
constitute an obvious proof of this.

1128
01:12:13.083 --> 01:12:16.208
A Labour deputation called on
the Prime Minister last night.

1129
01:12:16.291 --> 01:12:20.083
requesting the immediate evacuation
of women. children. and cripples

1130
01:12:20.166 --> 01:12:22.041
as precaution
against the sudden outbreak of war.

1131
01:12:22.125 --> 01:12:25.083
[man 1 in film] He'll find Buck Rogers
if anybody can.

1132
01:12:25.166 --> 01:12:27.166
[ships whirring]

1133
01:12:28.791 --> 01:12:30.875
[man 2 in film] Get the guards. you fools!

1134
01:12:30.958 --> 01:12:33.500
If they get away. I'll put every man
of you in the robot battalion!

1135
01:12:34.791 --> 01:12:36.208
[somber piano music playing]

1136
01:12:36.291 --> 01:12:37.500
[whispering] Not yet.

1137
01:12:39.625 --> 01:12:41.333
Not yet. [sniffles]

1138
01:12:45.375 --> 01:12:51.125
Darling. C.W. wants me to take
some of the corroded iron to the lab.

1139
01:12:51.208 --> 01:12:53.000
Uh. we think it might be fragmented armor.

1140
01:12:53.083 --> 01:12:55.875
and I… I badly want
to start cleaning it up. So…

1141
01:12:57.666 --> 01:12:58.666
Am I to come with you?

1142
01:12:58.750 --> 01:13:03.458
No. because C.W. needs
all the hands he can get here. so. uh…

1143
01:13:03.541 --> 01:13:05.500
And he's very pleased with you.

1144
01:13:05.583 --> 01:13:07.041
-Is he?
-[Piggott] Mm.

1145
01:13:07.875 --> 01:13:11.958
Uh. so I'm taking Brailesford
because the lab's really his thing.

1146
01:13:12.041 --> 01:13:15.375
-You know.
-Ah. Oh.

1147
01:13:16.250 --> 01:13:18.333
You're going to have
to be a brick about it. Margaret.

1148
01:13:18.416 --> 01:13:19.291
[Peggy] Peggy.

1149
01:13:21.083 --> 01:13:22.250
My name's Peggy.

1150
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
[warplanes roaring]

1151
01:13:30.625 --> 01:13:31.500
[Peggy sighs]

1152
01:13:32.750 --> 01:13:33.708
[mutters]

1153
01:13:39.125 --> 01:13:42.666
I'll… I'll…
I'll miss you very much. Peggy.

1154
01:13:47.583 --> 01:13:49.333
Sorry to take him away from you.

1155
01:13:49.916 --> 01:13:52.666
-[engine starts]
-[Peggy sighs]

1156
01:13:56.250 --> 01:13:58.500
[Peggy] It was very kind of you
to invite me. Mrs. Pretty.

1157
01:13:58.583 --> 01:14:01.375
[Pretty] You can't possibly stay
in that pub without your husband.

1158
01:14:01.458 --> 01:14:03.791
Mr. Phillips
would bore you quite to death.

1159
01:14:04.416 --> 01:14:08.208
Um. have you developed any
of your photographs yet. Mr. Lomax?

1160
01:14:08.291 --> 01:14:12.041
I've made a start. I've got a mountain
to do. and I better get through them.

1161
01:14:12.125 --> 01:14:13.916
I could get my papers any day.

1162
01:14:14.541 --> 01:14:16.791
Rory has been accepted into the RAF.

1163
01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.541
Should I congratulate you?

1164
01:14:20.041 --> 01:14:22.625
I don't know. Cousin Edith didn't.

1165
01:14:26.333 --> 01:14:27.416
This looks delicious.

1166
01:14:30.041 --> 01:14:31.125
[Pretty] Bon appétit.

1167
01:14:32.583 --> 01:14:35.083
[Pretty] Don't be too long. now. darling.
It's late.

1168
01:14:35.166 --> 01:14:37.875
[Brown] And now.
that's a partial eclipse of the moon.

1169
01:14:38.375 --> 01:14:39.833
[Pretty] And don't run.

1170
01:14:39.916 --> 01:14:40.833
[Pretty] Oh. dear.

1171
01:14:40.916 --> 01:14:42.083
[Pretty] Wait for us.

1172
01:14:42.166 --> 01:14:46.333
-[Pretty] Isn't that a bad omen?
-[Brown] Well. they used to think so.

1173
01:14:49.666 --> 01:14:52.208
[Pretty] It does make you feel
the gods are angry.

1174
01:14:52.291 --> 01:14:54.333
The people who buried that ship…

1175
01:14:55.958 --> 01:14:57.291
What did they believe?

1176
01:14:57.916 --> 01:15:01.625
[Brown] Well… they were sailing somewhere.
weren't they?

1177
01:15:02.875 --> 01:15:06.083
Down to the underworld or up to the stars.

1178
01:15:08.666 --> 01:15:10.541
[Pretty] Wherever we go when we die.

1179
01:15:14.125 --> 01:15:17.083
[Phillips] So we're rather coming
to the dregs. aren't we?

1180
01:15:17.916 --> 01:15:20.000
The coroner has been in touch.

1181
01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.416
An inquest has been called for Friday.
and your presence is required.

1182
01:15:26.541 --> 01:15:29.458
There's been quite
a lot of public interest in our ship.

1183
01:15:29.541 --> 01:15:32.541
So afterwards.
I've invited everyone to come and see it.

1184
01:15:32.625 --> 01:15:34.208
Uh… everyone?

1185
01:15:34.916 --> 01:15:38.125
[Pretty] The villagers are coming
and my friends from the county.

1186
01:15:38.791 --> 01:15:44.083
May I remind you
just how fragile this site is?

1187
01:15:45.291 --> 01:15:48.541
Please feel free
to invite your families and friends.

1188
01:15:50.125 --> 01:15:51.291
Mrs. Pretty…

1189
01:15:51.375 --> 01:15:54.291
[warplane sputtering]

1190
01:15:56.708 --> 01:15:57.916
Good God.

1191
01:15:59.750 --> 01:16:00.833
[Pretty] Robert?

1192
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.541
[warplane engine stops]

1193
01:16:12.125 --> 01:16:13.083
[loud crashing]

1194
01:16:13.166 --> 01:16:14.458
[water splashes]

1195
01:16:14.958 --> 01:16:18.041
Don't let anyone swim!
It's tidal. The current is fierce!

1196
01:16:18.125 --> 01:16:19.000
Darling.

1197
01:16:19.083 --> 01:16:20.583
[dramatic music playing]

1198
01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:44.458
[inhales deeply]

1199
01:17:27.625 --> 01:17:29.666
[Rory panting and grunting]

1200
01:17:39.291 --> 01:17:42.416
They train these boys
on rickety planes from the Great War.

1201
01:17:44.125 --> 01:17:46.000
My husband said.
"If you want your son to die.

1202
01:17:46.083 --> 01:17:48.000
then let him join the Air Force."

1203
01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:52.875
[Peggy] They say
this war will be fought in the air.

1204
01:17:54.583 --> 01:17:56.166
[Robert] What happened. Mother?

1205
01:17:56.958 --> 01:17:58.375
Is he all right?

1206
01:17:59.083 --> 01:18:02.083
-I must get Robert up to the house.
-Shall I take him for you?

1207
01:18:02.166 --> 01:18:05.791
-He won't want to go.
-Uh. I'll ask him to look after me.

1208
01:18:07.458 --> 01:18:08.583
[Pretty] Thank you.

1209
01:18:09.083 --> 01:18:09.916
[Peggy] Robert!

1210
01:18:10.625 --> 01:18:13.416
-[Robert] Yes?
-[Peggy sighs] I… I feel rather faint.

1211
01:18:14.166 --> 01:18:17.541
Oh. well. when I feel faint.
I have a good lie-down

1212
01:18:17.625 --> 01:18:18.958
and a big glass of water.

1213
01:18:19.083 --> 01:18:21.041
-[Peggy] Do you?
-[Robert] And that does the trick.

1214
01:18:21.125 --> 01:18:22.166
[Peggy] That's what I need.

1215
01:18:22.250 --> 01:18:24.083
-Will you take my hand?
-[Robert] Sure.

1216
01:18:26.875 --> 01:18:29.000
[seagulls screeching]

1217
01:18:52.625 --> 01:18:54.458
[Pretty exhales deeply]

1218
01:19:04.083 --> 01:19:08.916
[Peggy] His name was David Atkinson.
It was his second solo flight.

1219
01:19:10.750 --> 01:19:15.708
Police and the coroner are here.
I brought you some dry things.

1220
01:19:19.583 --> 01:19:22.875
[Rory] I've got some coffee
back at my tent.

1221
01:19:26.458 --> 01:19:27.750
Would you like some?

1222
01:19:31.458 --> 01:19:33.000
[Peggy] My father drowned…

1223
01:19:34.458 --> 01:19:36.000
on a holiday in Cornwall.

1224
01:19:36.541 --> 01:19:38.541
He was taken by the current.

1225
01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.708
-[Rory] I'm sorry.
-[Peggy] Oh. no.

1226
01:19:41.791 --> 01:19:43.333
It was a long time ago.

1227
01:19:44.583 --> 01:19:45.958
He had epilepsy.

1228
01:19:49.833 --> 01:19:51.750
So. what drew you to photography?

1229
01:19:52.250 --> 01:19:54.083
[Rory] Oh. I suppose it's. um…

1230
01:19:54.166 --> 01:19:57.541
It's just a way
of trying to fix things as they…

1231
01:19:58.291 --> 01:19:59.208
as they go past.

1232
01:19:59.291 --> 01:20:02.833
-[Peggy] Mm.
-[Rory] Keep what's vital from being lost.

1233
01:20:03.916 --> 01:20:07.583
My father once gave me an old coin…

1234
01:20:09.083 --> 01:20:12.166
and he said it was
from the time of Caesar Augustus.

1235
01:20:13.875 --> 01:20:18.583
And I knew the story from the Bible
where Jesus showed the disciples a coin.

1236
01:20:18.666 --> 01:20:21.541
"Render unto Caesar
the things that are Caesar's."

1237
01:20:23.958 --> 01:20:25.625
-[chuckles lightly]
-Yes.

1238
01:20:26.208 --> 01:20:27.583
And I… [sighs]

1239
01:20:27.666 --> 01:20:31.083
…well. I… I became convinced
that the coin I had

1240
01:20:31.166 --> 01:20:34.125
was the one that Jesus
had actually shown the disciples.

1241
01:20:34.625 --> 01:20:38.750
I used to marvel that I could hold it.

1242
01:20:43.125 --> 01:20:44.750
What happened to your coin?

1243
01:20:45.916 --> 01:20:47.125
Oh…

1244
01:20:49.708 --> 01:20:50.708
Uh…

1245
01:20:54.083 --> 01:20:56.041
-I wear it. [chuckles]
-[Rory gasps]

1246
01:21:02.041 --> 01:21:03.750
I thought it might bring me luck.

1247
01:21:06.666 --> 01:21:07.583
And has it?

1248
01:21:16.666 --> 01:21:18.041
If 1.000 years…

1249
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.875
were to pass in an instant…

1250
01:21:25.791 --> 01:21:27.333
what would be left of us?

1251
01:21:29.458 --> 01:21:30.291
[Peggy] This.

1252
01:21:34.333 --> 01:21:35.833
And parts of your watch.

1253
01:21:36.791 --> 01:21:37.916
Torch.

1254
01:21:39.833 --> 01:21:41.125
Fragments of the mug.

1255
01:21:42.958 --> 01:21:47.583
[Rory] But every last scrap
of you and I would… disappear.

1256
01:21:48.833 --> 01:21:50.666
-[Rory] Listen.
-[nightingales singing]

1257
01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:51.583
[Peggy] What?

1258
01:21:56.125 --> 01:21:59.416
[both gasp. laugh]

1259
01:22:00.958 --> 01:22:02.625
[Pretty sighs]

1260
01:22:07.375 --> 01:22:09.500
[Robert] The pilot died. didn't he?

1261
01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:11.666
Yes. darling.

1262
01:22:16.875 --> 01:22:17.833
Wait.

1263
01:22:19.791 --> 01:22:22.666
-[sighs. breathing shakily]
-[Robert] Rory won't die. will he?

1264
01:22:23.166 --> 01:22:24.166
I'm sorry.

1265
01:22:24.958 --> 01:22:25.916
No.

1266
01:22:35.666 --> 01:22:36.791
You won't die?

1267
01:22:47.791 --> 01:22:51.250
[breathing shakily]

1268
01:23:01.875 --> 01:23:03.875
[Pretty gasping]

1269
01:23:05.791 --> 01:23:06.833
[Peggy] Mrs. Pretty?

1270
01:23:06.916 --> 01:23:09.541
[Pretty continues gasping]

1271
01:23:10.458 --> 01:23:12.833
-[Peggy] Are you unwell?
-I've. um…

1272
01:23:12.916 --> 01:23:16.791
-Perhaps you might lead me to my room.
-Yes. of course. Of course.

1273
01:23:17.625 --> 01:23:21.208
-[groaning]
-[Peggy] Are you all right?

1274
01:23:21.291 --> 01:23:23.083
[Pretty laughing weakly] Yes! Yes.

1275
01:23:23.166 --> 01:23:25.541
-[Peggy] Should I call a doctor?
-[Pretty] No. no. no. It's…

1276
01:23:25.625 --> 01:23:27.208
It's heartburn. It's…

1277
01:23:27.291 --> 01:23:29.875
[muffled] No. I don't want to wake him.

1278
01:23:30.708 --> 01:23:31.708
[Robert gasps]

1279
01:23:32.666 --> 01:23:35.750
-[Pretty gasping]
-[Peggy] Mrs. Pretty. are you all right?

1280
01:23:37.208 --> 01:23:38.541
[Pretty] I'm such a bore.

1281
01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:42.791
Would you mind…
Would you mind getting me some milk?

1282
01:23:42.875 --> 01:23:44.041
-[Peggy] Yes.
-Thank you.

1283
01:23:44.125 --> 01:23:46.416
-[Peggy] Are you sure?
-[sobbing] Yes. thank you.

1284
01:23:50.250 --> 01:23:52.291
-[Peggy] Oh.
-Robert! Darling…

1285
01:23:52.375 --> 01:23:53.833
[moans]

1286
01:23:57.666 --> 01:23:58.875
[Robert panting]

1287
01:23:58.958 --> 01:24:00.833
-[grunts]
-[Brown] Oh! Robert.

1288
01:24:01.541 --> 01:24:03.333
-[Robert groans]
-[Brown] You all right?

1289
01:24:03.416 --> 01:24:04.333
[Robert shouts]

1290
01:24:05.875 --> 01:24:07.083
[Brown] Robert?

1291
01:24:07.166 --> 01:24:11.250
I know she's sick. I know it!
There's nothing I can do!

1292
01:24:11.333 --> 01:24:14.458
Why is there nothing I can do?
I should be able to make her better.

1293
01:24:14.541 --> 01:24:16.833
You do. You do make her better.

1294
01:24:17.458 --> 01:24:20.125
[Robert]
No. she's worse. She is. I can see it!

1295
01:24:20.875 --> 01:24:22.875
[sobbing]

1296
01:24:23.916 --> 01:24:24.958
She is.

1297
01:24:29.250 --> 01:24:30.958
When… When my father died…

1298
01:24:31.041 --> 01:24:32.500
[sobs heavily]

1299
01:24:32.583 --> 01:24:33.666
[Brown] Mm.

1300
01:24:33.750 --> 01:24:36.500
…everyone said
I had to look after my mother.

1301
01:24:37.041 --> 01:24:39.875
[sniffles] And I failed.

1302
01:24:39.958 --> 01:24:41.291
I failed.

1303
01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:46.625
Robert…

1304
01:24:46.708 --> 01:24:48.708
[gentle instrumental music playing]

1305
01:24:50.916 --> 01:24:51.958
…we all fail.

1306
01:24:54.375 --> 01:24:55.458
Every day.

1307
01:24:56.916 --> 01:24:59.708
There are some things
we just can't succeed at…

1308
01:25:01.208 --> 01:25:03.833
no matter how hard we try.

1309
01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:11.750
I know it's not what you want to hear.

1310
01:25:12.416 --> 01:25:15.000
I… I'm stronger than she thinks I am.

1311
01:25:16.125 --> 01:25:19.583
[Brown] I know. Perhaps you'll show her.

1312
01:25:22.791 --> 01:25:23.625
Now…

1313
01:25:24.666 --> 01:25:27.708
we should get you inside. Robert.

1314
01:25:28.791 --> 01:25:29.708
Come on.

1315
01:25:30.666 --> 01:25:33.083
I think it's time for your bed. you know.
Come on. then.

1316
01:25:33.875 --> 01:25:36.333
[Pretty breathing steadily]

1317
01:25:36.416 --> 01:25:39.958
[Brown and Robert speaking indistinctly]

1318
01:25:43.166 --> 01:25:44.500
[Phillips laughing]

1319
01:25:45.458 --> 01:25:47.708
[Phillips] Apparently.
there's a whole convoy

1320
01:25:47.791 --> 01:25:49.333
of hacks on the way.

1321
01:25:50.208 --> 01:25:54.541
I already have some joker
from the Sunday Mirror asking me

1322
01:25:54.625 --> 01:25:57.083
if the ship is still seaworthy.

1323
01:25:57.166 --> 01:26:01.416
So. what happens to the treasure?
That's the real question.

1324
01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:03.333
[radio announcer]
Germany has invaded Poland…

1325
01:26:03.416 --> 01:26:04.666
[Piggott] Have you seen my wife?

1326
01:26:04.750 --> 01:26:06.166
…and has bombed many towns.

1327
01:26:06.250 --> 01:26:10.625
Orders completing the mobilization
of the Navy. Army. and Air Force

1328
01:26:10.708 --> 01:26:14.458
were signed by the King at a meeting
this afternoon of the privy council.

1329
01:26:14.958 --> 01:26:16.833
[radio announcer 2]
The King and Queen decided...

1330
01:26:16.916 --> 01:26:18.125
[Phillips sighs] Well.

1331
01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:20.875
Here we go. then.

1332
01:26:20.958 --> 01:26:24.958
The Queen drove from the palace to visit
the Westminister ARP headquarters.

1333
01:26:27.541 --> 01:26:29.541
[somber instrumental music playing]

1334
01:26:54.708 --> 01:26:56.250
[Rory] I've just received this.

1335
01:27:00.416 --> 01:27:03.041
I'm to report
to RAF Martlesham this morning.

1336
01:27:03.750 --> 01:27:05.166
There's the inquest.

1337
01:27:05.250 --> 01:27:09.625
[scoffs] It's my medical assessment.
I can't… I can't bunk it. Sorry.

1338
01:27:09.708 --> 01:27:13.166
I put some photographs
in the dining room for your guests.

1339
01:27:14.333 --> 01:27:16.333
Rory. I'm telling you
in no uncertain terms

1340
01:27:16.416 --> 01:27:17.833
that you cannot possibly die.

1341
01:27:17.916 --> 01:27:18.916
[scoffs]

1342
01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.625
[Pretty] I'm saying this most seriously.
Don't you dare put yourself in danger.

1343
01:27:24.791 --> 01:27:29.000
Well… I'm not sure
I shall have much choice. [chuckles]

1344
01:27:30.375 --> 01:27:32.083
Robert is going to need you.

1345
01:27:34.416 --> 01:27:35.666
Do you understand?

1346
01:27:36.416 --> 01:27:37.875
[Brown] Good morning. Robert.

1347
01:27:38.416 --> 01:27:41.458
-Today's the day.
-I want to take my mother sailing.

1348
01:27:41.541 --> 01:27:43.333
I don't think
that ship is sailing anywhere.

1349
01:27:43.416 --> 01:27:45.708
You know. it's just compacted sand.

1350
01:27:46.375 --> 01:27:49.291
There's nothing holding it. except time.

1351
01:27:49.375 --> 01:27:52.916
-That won't matter. Not where we're going.
-Now. where's that. then?

1352
01:27:53.416 --> 01:27:57.375
-Will you come?
-[Brown] Well. if I'm invited. I'll come.

1353
01:27:59.625 --> 01:28:00.833
-Morning.
-[Rory] Hello.

1354
01:28:03.833 --> 01:28:04.916
Those for me?

1355
01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.875
[laughs] No. I'm looking for my wife.

1356
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.958
Well. perhaps you'd say goodbye for me.

1357
01:28:11.958 --> 01:28:13.375
I've been called up.

1358
01:28:13.458 --> 01:28:14.458
Oh.

1359
01:28:15.166 --> 01:28:16.250
Of course.

1360
01:28:17.333 --> 01:28:19.500
Well. best of British.

1361
01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.458
Stuart.

1362
01:28:22.291 --> 01:28:23.708
[Piggott] I… I bought you these.

1363
01:28:26.083 --> 01:28:26.916
How lovely.

1364
01:28:32.250 --> 01:28:35.583
Um. Lomax was just telling me
that he's been called up.

1365
01:28:39.041 --> 01:28:40.000
Oh.

1366
01:28:41.250 --> 01:28:43.625
-Uh. well. it…
-[Rory] Um…

1367
01:28:44.791 --> 01:28:45.958
[Peggy] Well. I…

1368
01:28:46.958 --> 01:28:49.250
Uh. I'd better go. Goodbye.

1369
01:28:57.833 --> 01:28:58.875
Uh…

1370
01:29:13.458 --> 01:29:15.458
[radio announcer]
According to an official telegram.

1371
01:29:15.541 --> 01:29:19.125
Warsaw has been bombed six times today.

1372
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.291
The telegram adds that fighting
of a most serious nature continues

1373
01:29:23.375 --> 01:29:24.875
on the whole length of the front.

1374
01:29:24.958 --> 01:29:27.125
We're in for another bloody mess.

1375
01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:30.291
[reporter 1] Oh. here we go.
Did you hear the results?

1376
01:29:30.375 --> 01:29:33.583
[people and reporters clamoring]

1377
01:29:33.666 --> 01:29:36.291
-[reporter 2] I just want a quick photo!
-[woman] Mrs. Pretty!

1378
01:29:36.375 --> 01:29:37.666
[officer] Please. make way.

1379
01:29:37.750 --> 01:29:39.750
[crowd clamoring]

1380
01:29:41.916 --> 01:29:43.458
[Brown] Make way. please.

1381
01:29:45.791 --> 01:29:48.208
-Do you want me in the car with you?
-[Pretty] Yes.

1382
01:29:48.291 --> 01:29:49.750
[Brown] Maynard! Maynard!

1383
01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:53.958
Maynard? Can you make sure
my wife gets in the house?

1384
01:29:54.041 --> 01:29:56.041
[crowd continues clamoring]

1385
01:29:57.666 --> 01:30:02.125
[Phillips] I… I hope I have
the opportunity to speak to you later.

1386
01:30:03.833 --> 01:30:06.000
-[woman 2] Mrs. Pretty?
-[woman 3] Mrs. Pretty!

1387
01:30:08.541 --> 01:30:09.958
[car horn honking loudly]

1388
01:30:10.041 --> 01:30:11.625
[crew speaking indistinctly]

1389
01:30:13.791 --> 01:30:16.541
[reporters shouting]

1390
01:30:22.208 --> 01:30:24.208
[Pretty breathing shakily]

1391
01:30:28.750 --> 01:30:31.083
[sobbing] I'm terribly sorry.

1392
01:30:38.791 --> 01:30:41.291
Thank you. Thank you.

1393
01:30:42.291 --> 01:30:47.333
[Phillips] These people
were not savage warriors.

1394
01:30:48.291 --> 01:30:49.750
These… These… These were…

1395
01:30:49.833 --> 01:30:54.708
These were sophisticated people
with incredible artistry.

1396
01:30:56.708 --> 01:31:00.375
The Dark Ages are no longer dark.

1397
01:31:00.958 --> 01:31:03.083
[brass band playing fanfare]

1398
01:31:03.166 --> 01:31:05.125
[indistinct chatter]

1399
01:31:09.250 --> 01:31:10.708
[glasses clink]

1400
01:31:10.791 --> 01:31:12.666
This is sherry.
I suppose it's sherry. is it?

1401
01:31:12.750 --> 01:31:13.875
[May] I don't know.

1402
01:31:14.958 --> 01:31:17.291
Should we drink it now.
or is there going to be a toast?

1403
01:31:17.375 --> 01:31:18.958
What's everyone else doing?

1404
01:31:19.041 --> 01:31:21.208
[glass clinks repeatedly]

1405
01:31:23.166 --> 01:31:25.166
[fanfare ends]

1406
01:31:25.708 --> 01:31:29.333
[Pretty] The artifacts discovered here
have caused a national sensation.

1407
01:31:30.333 --> 01:31:31.708
[Pretty] You must all know by now

1408
01:31:31.791 --> 01:31:34.708
that they were recovered
from a chamber in the middle of a ship…

1409
01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:39.291
a burial ship. engineered from oak.

1410
01:31:40.750 --> 01:31:44.333
In my opinion. the greatest
and most beautiful treasure of all.

1411
01:31:45.708 --> 01:31:49.125
Ninety feet long. lying east to west.

1412
01:31:50.541 --> 01:31:53.625
Found and excavated by Mr. Basil Brown.

1413
01:31:53.708 --> 01:31:54.916
[guests applaud]

1414
01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.333
-To Basil!
-Mr. Brown!

1415
01:31:56.416 --> 01:31:59.458
[guests cheer]

1416
01:32:03.750 --> 01:32:05.875
[sound fades]

1417
01:32:05.958 --> 01:32:07.958
[engine running]

1418
01:32:13.250 --> 01:32:15.250
[Pretty sobbing. sniffling]

1419
01:32:16.041 --> 01:32:17.208
I'm terribly sorry.

1420
01:32:19.833 --> 01:32:23.583
I thought you'd be pleased
with the verdict.

1421
01:32:30.791 --> 01:32:32.166
[Pretty] We die.

1422
01:32:34.625 --> 01:32:36.541
We die and we decay.

1423
01:32:38.375 --> 01:32:39.791
We don't live on.

1424
01:32:43.958 --> 01:32:45.833
I'm not sure I agree.

1425
01:32:47.250 --> 01:32:50.708
From the first human handprint
on a cave wall…

1426
01:32:51.833 --> 01:32:55.208
we're part of something continuous.

1427
01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:59.916
[Brown] So. we… don't really die.

1428
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
[gentle piano music playing]

1429
01:33:21.333 --> 01:33:23.333
[Peggy cries softly]

1430
01:33:30.833 --> 01:33:34.041
-[footsteps approaching]
-[Pretty] Rory put these out this morning.

1431
01:33:35.666 --> 01:33:37.333
It completely slipped my mind.

1432
01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:43.750
[Peggy sobbing]

1433
01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:53.500
Sit down.

1434
01:33:55.208 --> 01:33:57.000
[Peggy continues sobbing]

1435
01:34:00.541 --> 01:34:03.708
[Pretty] I'm sure
work like yours is very sustaining…

1436
01:34:05.458 --> 01:34:06.916
but it's not enough.

1437
01:34:10.416 --> 01:34:11.875
Life is very fleeting.

1438
01:34:13.583 --> 01:34:14.666
I've learnt that.

1439
01:34:16.041 --> 01:34:18.166
It has moments you should seize.

1440
01:34:25.041 --> 01:34:28.208
It could not be a better result.
Mrs. Pretty.

1441
01:34:28.791 --> 01:34:30.541
The whole of Suffolk
has been on your side.

1442
01:34:30.625 --> 01:34:32.666
-[Pretty] Yes.
-I saw you in her car.

1443
01:34:33.958 --> 01:34:36.666
Did she mention her intentions?

1444
01:34:36.750 --> 01:34:39.833
-About the tea?
-[scoffs] About the treasure. man.

1445
01:34:39.916 --> 01:34:42.166
-Oh.
-Yes. what's she planning?

1446
01:34:42.250 --> 01:34:44.416
We hope that you'll agree
that the Ipswich Museum

1447
01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:45.541
is the perfect place for--

1448
01:34:45.625 --> 01:34:49.041
-Can we talk another time? Excuse me.
-Yes. absolutely. Absolutely. Yes.

1449
01:34:49.125 --> 01:34:51.000
[Phillips] She trusts you. man.

1450
01:34:51.083 --> 01:34:52.791
Don't let her give it to Ipswich.

1451
01:34:53.416 --> 01:34:55.541
The British Museum would buy everything.

1452
01:34:55.625 --> 01:34:59.625
It's priceless. of course.
but she'll have to be reasonable.

1453
01:34:59.708 --> 01:35:01.916
Are you asking me to plead your case?

1454
01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.500
[Phillips sighs forcefully]

1455
01:35:03.583 --> 01:35:06.166
Have some lemon drizzle cake.
Mr. Phillips.

1456
01:35:06.250 --> 01:35:07.750
It is most refreshing.

1457
01:35:07.833 --> 01:35:09.458
[Phillips sighs]

1458
01:35:09.541 --> 01:35:12.500
Thank you so much for what you said.
I could have cheered.

1459
01:35:12.583 --> 01:35:13.416
[Pretty] Mm-hmm.

1460
01:35:14.125 --> 01:35:15.125
[May sighs]

1461
01:35:16.583 --> 01:35:18.958
[Pretty]
My son has formed a strong attachment.

1462
01:35:19.625 --> 01:35:21.541
[May] Basil's very fond of him. too.

1463
01:35:23.833 --> 01:35:26.291
Perhaps you might let him visit you
from time to time.

1464
01:35:27.333 --> 01:35:28.333
Of course.

1465
01:35:29.166 --> 01:35:30.541
We'd be glad to.

1466
01:35:33.791 --> 01:35:35.958
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Piggott laughing]

1467
01:35:36.375 --> 01:35:38.333
-[Piggott] Back in a tick.
-[Brailesford] Right.

1468
01:35:38.416 --> 01:35:40.416
[crew speaking indistinctly]

1469
01:35:44.041 --> 01:35:47.041
C.W.'s suggesting
we make a move to the ball.

1470
01:35:48.583 --> 01:35:52.291
Hmm. Well. I think
that you should go on… [clears throat]

1471
01:35:52.791 --> 01:35:54.125
…uh. without me.

1472
01:35:55.041 --> 01:35:56.000
So. will…

1473
01:35:56.791 --> 01:35:57.875
will you follow us?

1474
01:35:58.583 --> 01:35:59.583
[Peggy sighs] Uh…

1475
01:36:01.208 --> 01:36:02.291
I…

1476
01:36:03.416 --> 01:36:04.625
I don't think so.

1477
01:36:07.541 --> 01:36:08.541
[sighs]

1478
01:36:10.791 --> 01:36:11.750
No.

1479
01:36:13.291 --> 01:36:17.000
We both have our own paths
to. um. follow. don't we?

1480
01:36:17.083 --> 01:36:19.708
And I've seen you when you're happy.

1481
01:36:20.625 --> 01:36:21.916
You're rather beautiful.

1482
01:36:22.583 --> 01:36:24.500
-I'm happy with you.
-[sighs lightly]

1483
01:36:29.666 --> 01:36:32.166
-I could… I could learn to be.
-[Peggy sighs]

1484
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.250
I think that would be an awful shame.

1485
01:36:36.833 --> 01:36:38.833
[Brailesford] Stuart! Shall we wait?

1486
01:36:40.250 --> 01:36:42.208
[Phillips] Let's… Let's go. Come on.

1487
01:36:44.416 --> 01:36:45.333
Go on.

1488
01:36:54.250 --> 01:36:55.333
Go on.

1489
01:37:23.125 --> 01:37:24.250
[Brown] Hmm.

1490
01:37:26.458 --> 01:37:28.708
May… [clicks tongue]

1491
01:37:29.208 --> 01:37:32.583
That site. it needs to be made safe
for the future.

1492
01:37:32.666 --> 01:37:35.166
so it… it don't further decay. So…

1493
01:37:36.541 --> 01:37:38.208
that's another week's work.

1494
01:37:40.208 --> 01:37:43.041
[May]
You say your goodbyes to the old girl.

1495
01:37:44.416 --> 01:37:45.958
Do you take care of her.

1496
01:37:52.375 --> 01:37:54.458
You… You don't want to stay the night?

1497
01:37:55.125 --> 01:37:57.041
I'll see you next week.

1498
01:37:57.125 --> 01:37:58.500
[Brown exhales]

1499
01:38:09.958 --> 01:38:13.125
[warplanes humming]

1500
01:38:13.208 --> 01:38:15.458
[Brown] I'll line the hull with hessian…

1501
01:38:16.583 --> 01:38:19.500
and cover that
with a… a layer of branches…

1502
01:38:20.916 --> 01:38:23.000
to protect it
from the weight of the earth.

1503
01:38:23.083 --> 01:38:25.083
All this soil's got to go back in.

1504
01:38:26.708 --> 01:38:28.250
Leave it as we found it.

1505
01:38:30.708 --> 01:38:33.208
I'm giving the treasure
to the British Museum.

1506
01:38:35.166 --> 01:38:36.375
As a gift.

1507
01:38:39.250 --> 01:38:42.625
It should be where the greatest number
of people can freely see it.

1508
01:38:45.333 --> 01:38:46.750
I haven't told them yet.

1509
01:38:48.041 --> 01:38:49.500
I wanted to tell you.

1510
01:38:50.666 --> 01:38:53.208
[clicks tongue] Well. that's a…
That's a hell of a big gift.

1511
01:38:53.291 --> 01:38:57.625
[chuckles softly] I don't know
anyone's ever made a gift as big as that.

1512
01:38:58.333 --> 01:38:59.875
Apparently. they haven't.

1513
01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:07.750
I also told Mr. Phillips that I expect
your work to receive proper recognition.

1514
01:39:13.708 --> 01:39:14.666
Thank you.

1515
01:39:19.375 --> 01:39:21.375
[birds calling]

1516
01:39:23.875 --> 01:39:25.875
[somber piano music playing]

1517
01:39:26.458 --> 01:39:28.333
[Brown humming]

1518
01:39:38.625 --> 01:39:40.125
[Peggy takes a deep breath]

1519
01:39:44.625 --> 01:39:45.708
[sighs]

1520
01:40:06.541 --> 01:40:08.541
[birds singing]

1521
01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:14.958
[branches rustling]

1522
01:40:16.541 --> 01:40:17.625
[Peggy gasps]

1523
01:40:27.041 --> 01:40:29.958
-[Robert] Steer it steady. Mr. Brown.
-[Brown] Aye. aye.

1524
01:40:30.041 --> 01:40:32.000
We're coming towards the edge
of the atmosphere.

1525
01:40:32.083 --> 01:40:33.625
Can you see it. Mother?

1526
01:40:33.708 --> 01:40:35.750
We're sailing into the cosmos.

1527
01:40:36.250 --> 01:40:39.250
Yes. I can. Where are we heading?

1528
01:40:39.333 --> 01:40:42.500
Orion's Belt. to take the Queen home.

1529
01:40:43.083 --> 01:40:44.458
[Pretty] Which Queen?

1530
01:40:44.541 --> 01:40:49.041
This boat's hers. Her people gave
her treasure for her home voyage.

1531
01:40:53.333 --> 01:40:56.083
[Robert] And she was sad
when the ship came…

1532
01:40:57.375 --> 01:41:01.291
because she knew
she'd be leaving everyone behind.

1533
01:41:02.750 --> 01:41:04.625
And she was worried

1534
01:41:05.583 --> 01:41:08.375
that they wouldn't get on
very well without her…

1535
01:41:09.833 --> 01:41:13.041
but she knew
she had to follow the King into the sky.

1536
01:41:14.041 --> 01:41:15.541
And so. she set off…

1537
01:41:16.541 --> 01:41:19.750
through the Earth and up into the cosmos.

1538
01:41:20.958 --> 01:41:23.458
-Space is a funny thing.
-[Pretty chuckles]

1539
01:41:23.541 --> 01:41:28.875
Time operates quite differently up there.
and 500 years can pass in a flash.

1540
01:41:31.083 --> 01:41:33.458
And the Queen looked back down to Earth.

1541
01:41:34.166 --> 01:41:38.791
She could see that her son had grown up
and that he was now a space pilot.

1542
01:41:38.875 --> 01:41:40.041
[Pretty laughs]

1543
01:41:43.041 --> 01:41:47.250
[Robert] And she knew that when he made
his first journey up to the stars.

1544
01:41:48.125 --> 01:41:50.166
she would be there to meet him.

1545
01:41:51.125 --> 01:41:53.541
[Peggy panting. sobbing]

1546
01:41:56.250 --> 01:41:58.250
[seagulls crying]

1547
01:41:59.541 --> 01:42:00.791
[Peggy moans]

1548
01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:06.000
[Chamberlain on radio]
This morning. the British ambassador

1549
01:42:06.083 --> 01:42:10.708
in Berlin handed
the German government a final note…

1550
01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:17.125
stating that.
unless we heard from them by 11 o'clock.

1551
01:42:17.625 --> 01:42:22.708
that they were prepared at once
to withdraw their troops from Poland.

1552
01:42:22.791 --> 01:42:26.166
a state of war would exist between us.

1553
01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:28.750
I have to tell you now

1554
01:42:29.250 --> 01:42:32.041
that no such undertaking
has been received.

1555
01:42:33.041 --> 01:42:38.333
and that. consequently.
this country is at war with Germany.

1556
01:42:38.416 --> 01:42:40.875
-Good night. sir.
-Good night to you.

1557
01:42:40.958 --> 01:42:42.958
[indistinct chatter]

1558
01:42:43.041 --> 01:42:47.416
[Chamberlain] You can imagine
what a bitter blow it is to me

1559
01:42:47.916 --> 01:42:51.250
that all my long struggle
to win peace has failed.

1560
01:42:51.333 --> 01:42:53.125
-Good night to you.
-Good night.

1561
01:42:53.208 --> 01:42:55.208
[somber piano music playing]

1562
01:42:56.500 --> 01:42:58.750
[Chamberlain]
The government have made plans

1563
01:42:59.250 --> 01:43:02.916
under which it will be possible
to carry on the work of the nation

1564
01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.625
in the days of stress and strain
that may be ahead…

1565
01:43:07.291 --> 01:43:09.166
[coin jingles]

1566
01:43:09.250 --> 01:43:11.500
…but these plans need your help.

1567
01:43:15.416 --> 01:43:16.458
[Peggy sighs]

1568
01:43:17.125 --> 01:43:20.333
[Chamberlain] You may be taking your part
in the fighting services

1569
01:43:20.833 --> 01:43:22.250
or as a volunteer.

1570
01:43:24.083 --> 01:43:26.375
If so. you will report for duty

1571
01:43:26.458 --> 01:43:29.250
in accordance
with the instructions you receive.

1572
01:43:29.333 --> 01:43:30.458
[Peggy sighs]

1573
01:43:39.083 --> 01:43:43.083
[Chamberlain] It is of vital importance
that you should carry on with your jobs.

1574
01:43:46.791 --> 01:43:49.166
Now. may God bless you all.

1575
01:43:56.708 --> 01:43:58.291
[thunder rumbling in distance]

1576
01:44:00.708 --> 01:44:04.625
-[rain pattering]
-[wind whipping]

1577
01:44:10.833 --> 01:44:14.166
[Brown takes a deep breath. sniffles]

1578
01:44:43.625 --> 01:44:44.500
[Brown grunting]

1579
01:44:53.666 --> 01:44:55.166
[men grunting lightly]

1580
01:46:11.958 --> 01:46:13.708
[crew speaking indistinctly]

1581
01:48:01.541 --> 01:48:03.541
[energetic orchestral music playing]

1582
01:50:29.625 --> 01:50:32.416
[somber instrumental music playing]
