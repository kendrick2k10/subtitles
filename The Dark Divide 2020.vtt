3
00:02:51.294 --> 00:02:52.128
Hey.

4
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.046
Which pump?

5
00:02:53.088 --> 00:02:54.632
Oh. uh.

6
00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:56.467
I'm just messing with you.

7
00:02:56.508 --> 00:02:57.509
There's only one.

8
00:02:57.551 --> 00:02:59.594
Oh.

9
00:03:00.596 --> 00:03:01.472
That's a new one.

10
00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:03.349
Oh yeah. I mean you can't
knock it.

11
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.518
Tourists. love them.

12
00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:07.770
They just go nuts for that crap.

13
00:03:07.812 --> 00:03:09.564
Oh. I'm sure they do.

14
00:03:09.604 --> 00:03:10.522
What's the saying?

15
00:03:10.564 --> 00:03:12.525
There's one born every minute.

16
00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:13.401
Ooh.

17
00:03:15.151 --> 00:03:15.944
Hello.

18
00:03:15.986 --> 00:03:17.780
So where are you headed?

19
00:03:17.822 --> 00:03:21.825
The Gifford Pinchot National
Forest.

20
00:03:22.826 --> 00:03:24.036
Which reminds me.

21
00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:28.207
I've been having a little
difficulty here.

22
00:03:28.248 --> 00:03:29.125
So let me.

23
00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:31.377
wait. no. no.

24
00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:32.670
All right. I thought it went
this way.

25
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:34.337
All right. I need to go this
way.

26
00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.507
Unfortunately. I am not
as good at cartographer

27
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.136
as I am a lepidopterist. uh
okay.

28
00:03:40.177 --> 00:03:41.094
What?

29
00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:42.471
- I'm looking.
- What are we doing?

30
00:03:42.513 --> 00:03:44.390
Bear with me one second.
please.

31
00:03:45.765 --> 00:03:48.227
Okay. because. let's see.

32
00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:50.396
So we be. oh yeah.

33
00:03:50.437 --> 00:03:51.271
Am I here?

34
00:03:52.772 --> 00:03:54.358
You are here.

35
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.110
Ah. okay.

36
00:03:56.151 --> 00:03:59.571
You one of those owl people.

37
00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:00.698
No. no. no. no. no.

38
00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.201
I'm actually searching for
new species of butterfly.

39
00:04:04.242 --> 00:04:05.368
Butterflies?

40
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:06.204
And moths.

41
00:04:06.245 --> 00:04:07.371
In fact. three years ago.

42
00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:09.415
I discovered six new species

43
00:04:09.456 --> 00:04:11.250
and that is a Xerces Society
record.

44
00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:14.420
and I've authored several
books on the subject.

45
00:04:14.461 --> 00:04:15.253
You don't say.

46
00:04:15.295 --> 00:04:17.673
Yeah. that's kind of a big
deal.

47
00:04:17.714 --> 00:04:19.466
just so you know.

48
00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:22.345
And I should be getting there
just in time for the hatch.

49
00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:24.555
Much money in butterflies?

50
00:04:24.596 --> 00:04:25.555
- And moths.
- And. and moths.

51
00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:28.391
Yes. um. normally. no.

52
00:04:28.434 --> 00:04:30.269
but I do have a Guggenheim.

53
00:04:32.271 --> 00:04:33.980
You hunt butterflies with a
gun?

54
00:04:35.858 --> 00:04:37.192
No. it's a grant.

55
00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:40.821
And one doesn't hunt
butterflies. good grief.

56
00:04:40.862 --> 00:04:42.531
Where are you hiking to?

57
00:04:42.572 --> 00:04:44.407
I'm going from Highway 12.

58
00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:47.245
over Mount Adams to the Columbia
Gorge.

59
00:04:49.288 --> 00:04:50.581
On foot?

60
00:04:50.622 --> 00:04:51.748
Yeah.

61
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.877
Jesus. how long does that
take?

62
00:04:54.918 --> 00:04:57.879
Well. I'm anticipating up to a
month.

63
00:04:57.922 --> 00:05:00.049
Didn't Petras brothers do
something like that back in '88?

64
00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:01.759
Yeah. they sure did.

65
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.093
They got their ass kicked.

66
00:05:04.011 --> 00:05:04.804
Well.

67
00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:05.805
Yeah. he's right.

68
00:05:06.764 --> 00:05:09.516
I mean. you should not do this
right now.

69
00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:10.350
That's trail's no joke.

70
00:05:10.392 --> 00:05:12.310
The bears have slept awful
long.

71
00:05:12.353 --> 00:05:13.855
They're gonna be extra hungry.

72
00:05:16.815 --> 00:05:18.775
I think I'll be. I'll be fine.

73
00:05:18.817 --> 00:05:19.818
Thank you though.

74
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.195
I've done several
overnights in the field. so.

75
00:05:22.237 --> 00:05:23.322
Overnights.

76
00:05:23.363 --> 00:05:24.197
Overnights?

77
00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:30.288
Perhaps I should get
another bag of peanuts.

78
00:05:30.329 --> 00:05:31.247
For the. it's a long trip.

79
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.292
It's not the first
time I've ever heard that.

80
00:06:58.334 --> 00:06:59.125
Getting it in right the first
time.

81
00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:06.425
It was so funny.

82
00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:09.762
See you in the rec room.

83
00:07:10.762 --> 00:07:13.139
But you can't have
bees in your walls. Bob.

84
00:07:13.182 --> 00:07:14.934
you're going to have to
spray before summer comes.

85
00:07:14.975 --> 00:07:17.019
They're harmless honeybees.

86
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.562
Nature's pollinators.

87
00:07:18.603 --> 00:07:19.813
Harmless?

88
00:07:19.855 --> 00:07:20.897
When it heats up. you're going
to have

89
00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:23.108
every rat in the county
running around your place.

90
00:07:23.149 --> 00:07:24.901
I didn't realize your PhD in
art history

91
00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:27.947
made you an expert on rodents.
Carl.

92
00:07:27.988 --> 00:07:30.073
Who's to say that the
chemicals that we spray

93
00:07:30.115 --> 00:07:31.741
on so-called nuisance species.

94
00:07:31.783 --> 00:07:35.663
aren't affecting other insect
populations.

95
00:07:35.704 --> 00:07:36.496
You know?

96
00:07:36.538 --> 00:07:37.539
And that's another reason why

97
00:07:37.581 --> 00:07:40.250
my Gifford Pinchot
expedition is so critical.

98
00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:42.795
Nobody has amassed a
comprehensive list

99
00:07:42.836 --> 00:07:44.671
of the Lepidoptera in the
region.

100
00:07:44.713 --> 00:07:47.216
And until we catalog all the
species that reside there.

101
00:07:47.257 --> 00:07:50.218
how are we gonna know whether
their numbers are dwindling?

102
00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:53.930
That is a great point.

103
00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:54.848
In fact. tell us a little bit
more

104
00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:57.560
about this proposal of yours.

105
00:07:57.601 --> 00:07:59.728
I assume that you already
have a start date.

106
00:07:59.769 --> 00:08:01.313
you've already planned out.

107
00:08:01.355 --> 00:08:03.399
I don't have a date as of yet.

108
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.402
My. my class schedule is.
is just crazy this semester.

109
00:08:07.444 --> 00:08:08.612
So you're going during the
summer break.

110
00:08:08.653 --> 00:08:09.447
Oh that's terrific.

111
00:08:09.487 --> 00:08:10.322
Summer makes perfect sense.

112
00:08:10.363 --> 00:08:11.448
Yeah.

113
00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.617
Not necessarily. I don't
have a date as of yet.

114
00:08:13.658 --> 00:08:16.077
It's really a complicated
endeavor. gentlemen.

115
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.288
Yeah. it must be.

116
00:08:17.329 --> 00:08:19.122
You've been talking
about this for years now.

117
00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:20.124
Yeah.

118
00:08:20.165 --> 00:08:22.293
So Bob. will you bring
your supplies with you

119
00:08:22.334 --> 00:08:24.794
or are you going to have
them drop by helicopter?

120
00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:28.132
Well. I suppose. I suppose
there's a.

121
00:08:28.173 --> 00:08:30.133
you bring some and then others
are dropped

122
00:08:30.175 --> 00:08:31.593
and then one would have.

123
00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:34.721
You have gym membership.
you've been going right?

124
00:08:34.764 --> 00:08:35.681
Checking it out. getting
yourself ready.

125
00:08:35.722 --> 00:08:37.474
I'm. I'm in very good shape.

126
00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:39.352
My BMI is actually a.

127
00:08:39.393 --> 00:08:40.728
I can't remember if it's a low
or high.

128
00:08:40.769 --> 00:08:41.812
but whatever that number
it's supposed to be

129
00:08:41.854 --> 00:08:43.105
is. it's better.

130
00:08:43.147 --> 00:08:44.357
Bob. you've been camping
before. right?

131
00:08:45.524 --> 00:08:47.985
Yes. of course I've been
camping before.

132
00:08:48.027 --> 00:08:48.985
Cub Scouts. that kind.

133
00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:50.821
I mean. have I done
a. an expedition. no.

134
00:08:50.863 --> 00:08:52.073
but I've been overnight.

135
00:08:52.114 --> 00:08:52.949
What happens if you get sick?

136
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:53.783
Sprained ankle. something like
that?

137
00:08:53.823 --> 00:08:55.492
What if you broke your leg.
Bob?

138
00:08:55.534 --> 00:08:56.660
What if you lost your glasses?

139
00:08:56.701 --> 00:08:58.287
There are mountain lions out
there too.

140
00:08:58.328 --> 00:08:59.120
Rattlesnakes.

141
00:08:59.163 --> 00:08:59.956
And tigers.

142
00:08:59.996 --> 00:09:01.373
Okay. okay.

143
00:09:01.414 --> 00:09:02.290
Have you ever sucked the venom
out

144
00:09:02.332 --> 00:09:03.541
of a poisonous bite. Bob. ever?

145
00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:05.043
Big rivers you can drown in.

146
00:09:05.086 --> 00:09:07.004
I went to the rental car place

147
00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:11.926
and I see this giant
broken down station wagon

148
00:09:11.967 --> 00:09:13.426
that they're gonna junk.

149
00:09:13.469 --> 00:09:15.596
and I'm like that one.

150
00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:17.348
Give me that one.

151
00:09:17.389 --> 00:09:18.765
And they did.

152
00:09:18.807 --> 00:09:22.562
And I drove it up to 84
and I get it going 105.

153
00:09:24.437 --> 00:09:25.230
No.

154
00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:26.606
And then I come around the
corner

155
00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:27.984
and all of a sudden there it is

156
00:09:28.024 --> 00:09:32.654
that big yellow sign. runaway
truck ramp.

157
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:34.573
Tell them. tell them.

158
00:09:34.615 --> 00:09:38.744
Oh well. it.

159
00:09:38.785 --> 00:09:41.037
The car bottomed out.
she snapped the front axle.

160
00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.581
and Thea broke her nose and
chipped

161
00:09:42.623 --> 00:09:44.750
her two front teeth on the
steering wheel.

162
00:09:44.792 --> 00:09:45.585
Oh goodness.

163
00:09:45.625 --> 00:09:46.543
Yes. those are plastic.

164
00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:48.379
Oh my God.

165
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.381
So. reckless and
irresponsible.

166
00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:51.631
Irresponsible?

167
00:09:51.673 --> 00:09:52.466
Yes.

168
00:09:52.508 --> 00:09:53.466
What are you talking about?

169
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:57.180
I sprung for the insurance
when I rented it.

170
00:09:57.221 --> 00:09:59.307
Okay. that wasn't what.

171
00:09:59.347 --> 00:10:00.140
You all right?

172
00:10:00.182 --> 00:10:00.975
Mm-hmm.

173
00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:01.809
You okay?

174
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:02.643
Mm-hmm.

175
00:10:02.684 --> 00:10:03.476
Yeah. yeah.

176
00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:04.729
I just want to tell them about
you.

177
00:10:04.769 --> 00:10:05.730
Are. you all right?

178
00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:06.605
Mm-hmm.

179
00:10:08.481 --> 00:10:11.067
So exciting.

180
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:14.238
Bob's publisher can't wait
to read the first draft

181
00:10:14.279 --> 00:10:15.906
of his next book.

182
00:10:15.947 --> 00:10:17.199
Mm. yes.

183
00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:21.037
Well. are you going to
be doing the illustrations

184
00:10:21.077 --> 00:10:22.413
for this one as well?

185
00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:23.538
Well. of course.

186
00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:25.249
How are you going to find
another artist who knows

187
00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:26.209
the difference between

188
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.878
an Arabia Magdalena and a common
Alpine?

189
00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:30.713
Can't be done.

190
00:10:30.754 --> 00:10:32.340
You can't. they don't exist.

191
00:10:33.216 --> 00:10:34.424
Well. I can't wait to read it.

192
00:10:34.466 --> 00:10:37.761
And I. for one. can't wait
to get started working on it.

193
00:10:37.802 --> 00:10:42.807
And I mean that quite literally.
I mean. I truly can't wait.

194
00:10:44.851 --> 00:10:46.144
Can I have a water?

195
00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:46.979
Yeah. of course. of
course.

196
00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.855
Okay. thanks.

197
00:11:58.967 --> 00:12:00.010
Come on. big fella.

198
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.231
Oh God. sorry. sorry.

199
00:12:55.774 --> 00:12:59.569
Bob. let's dial back on
you being so miserable.

200
00:12:59.611 --> 00:13:02.197
Well. I apologize. but my wife
is.

201
00:13:04.241 --> 00:13:05.075
Alive.

202
00:13:07.245 --> 00:13:08.120
I'm alive.

203
00:13:09.413 --> 00:13:10.831
I know.

204
00:13:10.873 --> 00:13:11.999
I know.

205
00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:13.417
I know.

206
00:13:13.458 --> 00:13:14.251
I'm okay.

207
00:13:14.293 --> 00:13:15.253
I know.

208
00:13:15.293 --> 00:13:16.127
I know.

209
00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:21.299
Stop. no!

210
00:13:21.341 --> 00:13:23.385
Ow. quit it. don't!

211
00:13:24.302 --> 00:13:25.136
Don't.

212
00:13:28.515 --> 00:13:29.307
Thea.

213
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:30.225
I'm fine. I'm fine. look.

214
00:13:30.268 --> 00:13:31.476
No. you're not fine.

215
00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:32.394
Yes I am.

216
00:13:32.436 --> 00:13:33.271
Honey.

217
00:13:35.605 --> 00:13:37.232
Grab your girlfriend. Marsha.

218
00:13:37.274 --> 00:13:38.775
Go look for specimens.

219
00:13:38.817 --> 00:13:39.860
No.

220
00:13:39.902 --> 00:13:40.862
And scribble down some of that
poetry

221
00:13:40.903 --> 00:13:42.947
you keep threatening to write.

222
00:13:42.989 --> 00:13:45.240
Just. just get away from me for
awhile.

223
00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:46.576
No.

224
00:13:46.616 --> 00:13:48.660
Thea no. hey. hey. hey.

225
00:13:48.702 --> 00:13:49.703
I'm here right now.

226
00:13:49.745 --> 00:13:50.538
What can I do?

227
00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:51.497
Go.

228
00:13:51.538 --> 00:13:54.542
I already made you a
lunch. it's with Marsha.

229
00:13:54.583 --> 00:13:56.585
Go.

230
00:13:56.626 --> 00:13:58.128
Just go chase something.

231
00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:01.591
Thank you.

232
00:14:01.631 --> 00:14:02.424
You're welcome.

233
00:14:02.466 --> 00:14:03.259
I love you.

234
00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:04.343
I love you more.

235
00:14:53.183 --> 00:14:57.855
Ma'am. don't change your
baby on the air hockey table.

236
00:14:59.273 --> 00:15:00.942
One adult. no children.

237
00:15:00.982 --> 00:15:03.068
I'm joining a birthday party.

238
00:15:03.985 --> 00:15:07.532
Hey Steve. do we have a
birthday party scheduled today?

239
00:15:32.264 --> 00:15:33.598
Don't test me. dude.

240
00:15:38.437 --> 00:15:40.398
Game over.

241
00:16:49.091 --> 00:16:50.592

Well. you're really quite
common.

289
00:24:11.741 --> 00:24:12.617
Did you know that?

290
00:24:15.538 --> 00:24:16.372
Sorry.

291
00:24:29.509 --> 00:24:30.802
Wait. Marsha?

292
00:24:30.845 --> 00:24:33.096
It's bad luck to name it after
me.

293
00:24:33.138 --> 00:24:34.472
You know like a boat.

294
00:24:34.515 --> 00:24:36.100
Wait. you named this after a
boat?

295
00:24:36.142 --> 00:24:37.934
No. it's bad luck.

296
00:24:37.977 --> 00:24:40.313
You don't name a boat after your
wife?

297
00:24:40.354 --> 00:24:41.771
Oh. I didn't. I'm not a
Seafarer.

298
00:24:41.814 --> 00:24:43.691
Wll. I will get you a
captain's hat.

299
00:24:43.732 --> 00:24:44.567
All right. thank you.

300
00:24:44.608 --> 00:24:46.818
And I would like to try this
bad boy.

301
00:24:46.861 --> 00:24:47.653
Bad boy?

302
00:24:47.694 --> 00:24:49.905
Bad girl. bad girl. bye.

303
00:24:49.946 --> 00:24:51.573
I see another bad girl.

304
00:24:51.615 --> 00:24:52.950
Oh. I've got a bad girl.

305
00:24:52.991 --> 00:24:54.451
No!

306
00:24:54.492 --> 00:24:55.285
Bad boy's coming.

307
00:25:08.508 --> 00:25:09.467
Ow. don't.

308
00:25:09.509 --> 00:25:10.343
Sorry.

309
00:25:13.179 --> 00:25:15.014
I've got your electrolytes
and you're water.

310
00:25:15.056 --> 00:25:16.932
I know. I know.

311
00:25:26.067 --> 00:25:28.109
What's gonna happen to you when
I'm gone?

312
00:25:33.449 --> 00:25:35.368
You're gonna be fine.

313
00:25:36.701 --> 00:25:39.579
Do I look like I'm gonna be
fine?

314
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:42.082
Do I?

315
00:25:42.124 --> 00:25:42.959
Huh. do I?

316
00:25:52.009 --> 00:25:53.219
I don't need an audience!

317
00:25:54.135 --> 00:25:55.930
I don't need an audience. go!

318
00:25:57.390 --> 00:25:58.432
I just want to make sure.

319
00:25:58.473 --> 00:26:00.183
make you feel better.

320
00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:18.536
What have I done to
deserve this?

321
00:28:35.088 --> 00:28:36.631
Oh. hey.

322
00:28:36.673 --> 00:28:39.885
Do you need a painkillers or
water?

323
00:28:43.055 --> 00:28:45.057
When I wrecked that stupid
rental car.

324
00:28:47.518 --> 00:28:49.060
you must've been furious.

325
00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:50.980
Thea.

326
00:28:51.021 --> 00:28:53.398
You were furious. why
didn't you yell at me?

327
00:28:55.942 --> 00:28:56.777
It's fine.

328
00:29:00.906 --> 00:29:01.740
Bob.

329
00:29:02.991 --> 00:29:05.161
We're almost out of the
Dilaudid.

330
00:29:06.287 --> 00:29:08.623
I'll call the pharmacy.

331
00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:11.708
put in another order.

332
00:29:14.836 --> 00:29:16.756
I played one last trick on
you.

333
00:29:18.173 --> 00:29:23.179
And this time you're
gonna be really pissed.

334
00:29:23.221 --> 00:29:24.763
And burdock root.

335
00:29:24.805 --> 00:29:27.432
We are now officially out of
burdock root.

336
00:29:29.769 --> 00:29:33.605
With any luck. you'll get
the punchline in a few weeks.

337
00:29:37.359 --> 00:29:40.278
I guess I can have Ms
Santisa drive me into town.

338
00:29:41.446 --> 00:29:44.241
That'll be Friday. so
I think we have enough.

339
00:29:44.282 --> 00:29:47.619
We have enough until then.
when she can drive it down.

340
00:29:48.621 --> 00:29:49.455
Hey.

341
00:29:51.082 --> 00:29:52.124
just be with me.

342
00:29:58.881 --> 00:29:59.715
Come on.

343
00:30:12.478 --> 00:30:14.020
Hey Bob.

344
00:30:14.063 --> 00:30:14.897
Hm?

345
00:30:16.356 --> 00:30:17.357
Knock knock.

346
00:30:19.527 --> 00:30:21.028
Thea.

347
00:30:21.069 --> 00:30:21.987
Come on.

348
00:30:24.115 --> 00:30:24.949
Knock knock.

349
00:30:29.494 --> 00:30:30.328
Who's there?

350
00:30:40.964 --> 00:30:41.798
Death.

351
00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:46.386
That's not funny.

352
00:30:47.971 --> 00:30:49.514
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

353
00:30:54.353 --> 00:30:55.730
It was a little funny.

354
00:31:04.363 --> 00:31:07.158
All right. it's a little
funny.

355
00:32:03.256 --> 00:32:04.382
I mean.

356
00:32:04.423 --> 00:32:06.217
if we're not going to personally
experience biodiversity.

357
00:32:06.259 --> 00:32:08.510
we won't expect it to exist
anywhere.

358
00:32:08.553 --> 00:32:13.558
And really only by observing
and recording what's out there

359
00:32:14.432 --> 00:32:16.434
can we hope to?

360
00:32:21.816 --> 00:32:22.650
Conserve it.

361
00:32:23.859 --> 00:32:25.026
We hope to conserve it.

362
00:32:28.489 --> 00:32:31.241
Okay. well thank you
very much for your time.

363
00:32:32.117 --> 00:32:33.785
Again. I can explain any of
this.

364
00:32:34.953 --> 00:32:37.123
I'm here to sign books if you
want.

365
00:33:54.991 --> 00:33:55.826
Oh wow.

366
00:34:00.288 --> 00:34:01.123
Thea.

367
00:34:08.297 --> 00:34:09.130

368
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:12.552

That is beautiful.

379
00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:09.634
Oh.

380
00:42:09.528 --> 00:42:13.157
Oh. ah.

381
00:42:19.204 --> 00:42:22.458
Oh. oh.

382
00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:23.333
oh God.

383
00:42:29.632 --> 00:42:30.633
Stupid belt!

384
00:43:40.786 --> 00:43:41.621
Hello.

385
00:43:44.498 --> 00:43:46.541
Oh man. do you smell that?

386
00:44:07.146 --> 00:44:09.481
You think I crapped my pants.
don't you?

387
00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:12.984
You think I crapped my own
pants?

388
00:44:14.027 --> 00:44:15.237
Why would I do that?

389
00:44:15.278 --> 00:44:16.072
Why would I?

390
00:44:16.112 --> 00:44:17.239
Oh yeah. run away!

391
00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:21.076
Run away from the pants
crapping monster. yes!

392
00:44:25.748 --> 00:44:26.581
God.

393
00:44:31.503 --> 00:44:34.297
Yes. it does look like a crapped
my pants.

394
00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:35.967
No it doesn't. 'cause it's on
the outside.

395
00:44:36.007 --> 00:44:37.134
If I did that. it would have had

396
00:44:37.175 --> 00:44:39.344
to go all the way through. I
take it back.

397
00:49:29.385 --> 00:49:31.095
Oh gosh. sorry.

398
00:49:31.137 --> 00:49:31.929
Sorry.

399
00:49:38.143 --> 00:49:38.977
Jesus!

400
00:49:42.815 --> 00:49:45.902
She thought he was a
spirit hidden in the woods.

401
00:49:45.943 --> 00:49:47.570
She thought you were a
bigfoot.

402
00:49:49.947 --> 00:49:51.157
Do I look like a god
damn bigfoot to you?

403
00:49:54.117 --> 00:49:55.286
You almost shot me.

404
00:49:56.329 --> 00:49:57.121
It's okay.

405
00:49:57.163 --> 00:49:58.496
You almost shot me.

406
00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:09.342
You're gonna hike all
the way to the gorge?

407
00:50:09.382 --> 00:50:14.346
Yes. I'm on a field study on
lepidoptera in the region.

408
00:50:16.014 --> 00:50:17.016
I have a Guggenheim.

409
00:50:19.726 --> 00:50:20.685
I got a Guggenheim.

410
00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:24.856
That trail you've been hiking.

411
00:50:24.898 --> 00:50:27.652
was a highway for 20.000 years.

412
00:50:27.693 --> 00:50:30.530
My ancestors would trade
salmon from the river.

413
00:50:30.570 --> 00:50:32.614
obsidian from the Oregon
deserts.

414
00:50:32.657 --> 00:50:34.325
seashells from the coast.

415
00:50:34.367 --> 00:50:37.245
The four corners of this
land. where the volcanoes.

416
00:50:38.454 --> 00:50:41.164
Tahoma to the North. Paito to
the East.

417
00:50:41.206 --> 00:50:44.085
Wais to the South and Lewit to
the West.

418
00:50:44.126 --> 00:50:47.421
Our stories say that Wais and
Lewit

419
00:50:47.463 --> 00:50:49.548
were once lovers who were turned
to stone.

420
00:50:51.092 --> 00:50:51.925
Lovers.

421
00:50:53.469 --> 00:50:56.556
The tribes met at Council
Lake at the base of Pato.

422
00:50:56.597 --> 00:50:59.267
but they abandoned because
there's too many bigfeet there.

423
00:50:59.307 --> 00:51:02.478
They renamed it Cotas Lake. Bad
Lake.

424
00:51:02.519 --> 00:51:05.105
So there's more than one
bigfoot?

425
00:51:05.146 --> 00:51:07.732
Okay. so doc.

426
00:51:10.735 --> 00:51:11.653
what do you think?

427
00:51:13.072 --> 00:51:14.532
Tell me.

428
00:51:14.574 --> 00:51:15.407
your thoughts.

429
00:51:16.826 --> 00:51:19.829
Do you believe bigfoot exists?

430
00:51:26.626 --> 00:51:30.380
No. I don't believe that
bigfoot exists.

431
00:51:30.422 --> 00:51:32.841
At least not in the traditional
sense.

432
00:51:32.884 --> 00:51:37.304
I do believe he exists as a
sort of totem or a symbol.

433
00:51:37.346 --> 00:51:38.681
My man.

434
00:51:38.722 --> 00:51:40.307
Totem.

435
00:51:40.349 --> 00:51:42.518
But you've seen things
you can't explain.

436
00:51:44.061 --> 00:51:45.104
That is true.

437
00:51:48.273 --> 00:51:49.317
Come on.

438
00:51:49.358 --> 00:51:51.360
You're. you screwing around?

439
00:51:51.402 --> 00:51:53.237
Grandpa saw one.

440
00:51:53.278 --> 00:51:55.489
Grandpa saw a lot of things.

441
00:51:55.530 --> 00:51:58.701
The old boy loved his peyote
ritual.

442
00:51:58.742 --> 00:52:01.871
Tried to convince everybody
he was a medicine man.

443
00:52:01.913 --> 00:52:03.623
He was really just an old pot
head.

444
00:52:03.664 --> 00:52:05.333
So is your dad.

445
00:52:05.373 --> 00:52:06.416
You know that.

446
00:52:06.458 --> 00:52:10.587
That's why your mom.
lovely woman that she is.

447
00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:11.463
traded up.

448
00:52:12.923 --> 00:52:14.090
They were Holy men.

449
00:52:14.132 --> 00:52:16.176
and you eat peyote you don't
smoke it.

450
00:52:16.219 --> 00:52:17.220
Okay.

451
00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:18.387
Either way.

452
00:52:18.429 --> 00:52:20.597
Just bunch of old dopers. that's
all.

453
00:52:20.639 --> 00:52:21.681
Holy men.

454
00:52:21.724 --> 00:52:22.975
It's our heritage.

455
00:52:23.016 --> 00:52:24.351
Some heritage. am I right?

456
00:52:24.393 --> 00:52:25.603
What do you got that's so
great

457
00:52:25.644 --> 00:52:26.603
besides a disability check?

458
00:52:26.646 --> 00:52:29.315
Hey. hey hey. easy biggun.

459
00:52:29.356 --> 00:52:30.565
Let it go.

460
00:52:30.608 --> 00:52:31.442
let it go.

461
00:52:35.612 --> 00:52:36.989
Buncha.

462
00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:39.324
Bigfoot sleeps in lava
tunnels.

463
00:52:39.367 --> 00:52:40.952
Deep beneath Pato.

464
00:52:40.992 --> 00:52:43.496
He protects the forest and its
creatures.

465
00:52:43.538 --> 00:52:44.956
But when white man gets too
greedy

466
00:52:44.996 --> 00:52:46.790
and steals too much of his land.

467
00:52:46.831 --> 00:52:49.751
bigfoot smashes his trucks as
revenge.

468
00:52:53.505 --> 00:52:55.841
All right. Shane. that is
enough.

469
00:52:55.882 --> 00:52:57.425
Why do you always turn into such
an ass

470
00:52:57.467 --> 00:53:00.303
when other white people are
around?

471
00:53:00.346 --> 00:53:01.347
What?

472
00:53:01.389 --> 00:53:02.306
- Uh.
- You heard me.

473
00:53:02.347 --> 00:53:03.181
I don't.

474
00:53:05.684 --> 00:53:09.480
I didn't even know he's
white. how about that?

475
00:53:09.521 --> 00:53:10.940
You're white?

476
00:53:10.981 --> 00:53:12.148
Uh. yes.

477
00:53:12.190 --> 00:53:12.983
You don't raise your voice to
me.

478
00:53:13.025 --> 00:53:14.985
Or what. you'll move out?

479
00:53:15.027 --> 00:53:15.862
Huh?

480
00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:17.654
I might.

481
00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:20.824
So.

482
00:53:22.034 --> 00:53:22.869
you're married?

483
00:53:28.833 --> 00:53:29.666
I was.

484
00:53:31.168 --> 00:53:33.420
Well. when did you guys split
up?

485
00:53:39.552 --> 00:53:40.385
We didn't

486
00:53:43.347 --> 00:53:44.182
split up.

487
00:53:52.231 --> 00:53:53.065
Oh.

488
00:53:54.275 --> 00:53:57.403
I met her in mushroom class.

489
00:53:59.530 --> 00:54:02.325
About this time every year

490
00:54:03.701 --> 00:54:07.163
she would get fungus fever.
is what she would call it.

491
00:54:07.204 --> 00:54:11.833
And we'd go out hunting and.

492
00:54:11.876 --> 00:54:12.710
but she's good.

493
00:54:14.003 --> 00:54:14.879
She was good.

494
00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:16.047
She was. she.

495
00:54:17.088 --> 00:54:18.632
she was. she was very good.

496
00:54:22.135 --> 00:54:27.016
I wouldn't want to be a
chanterelle in a forest with her.

497
00:54:31.646 --> 00:54:33.105
And I fell in love with her

498
00:54:34.273 --> 00:54:36.442
the second I heard her name.

499
00:54:37.818 --> 00:54:38.945
Thea Linnaea.

500
00:54:39.945 --> 00:54:43.074
Linnaea. like the little twin
flowers.

501
00:54:44.282 --> 00:54:46.451
Linnaea borealis. yes.

502
00:55:00.715 --> 00:55:03.635
You know. he was a good man
once.

503
00:55:09.934 --> 00:55:11.269
Sometimes he still is.

504
00:55:14.271 --> 00:55:15.981
He forgets how angry he is.

505
00:55:19.277 --> 00:55:22.445
Well. I can't say I blame him.

506
00:55:22.487 --> 00:55:26.867
You know there's. a lot to be
angry about.

507
00:55:26.909 --> 00:55:30.538
Life is exceptionally unfair.

508
00:55:35.501 --> 00:55:38.963
I was hoping that this journey

509
00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:43.592
would help me get through that.

510
00:55:43.634 --> 00:55:45.427
you know. so that I could move
on.

511
00:55:47.847 --> 00:55:48.764
Maybe you should start looking

512
00:55:48.806 --> 00:55:50.849
to yourself for the answers.

513
00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:04.112
Thank you.

514
00:56:06.865 --> 00:56:08.367
A little hungry.

515
00:57:15.518 --> 00:57:18.603
Look out. look out. look
out!

516
00:57:25.652 --> 00:57:27.487
All right. back it up.

517
00:57:39.208 --> 00:57:40.793
Oh wow. if it isn't the owl
nut.

518
00:57:40.835 --> 00:57:41.711
What?

519
00:57:41.751 --> 00:57:42.795
Oh. you're the man from the gas
station.

520
00:57:42.836 --> 00:57:44.713
I knew there was something
about you I didn't like.

521
00:57:44.755 --> 00:57:47.508
I don't know how you did
it or how many men you had.

522
00:57:47.550 --> 00:57:48.426
How you did this without a
winch.

523
00:57:48.467 --> 00:57:50.177
Whoa whoa whoa. gentlemen.
gentlemen.

524
00:57:50.219 --> 00:57:52.012
Gentlemen. let's be rational
here.

525
00:57:52.054 --> 00:57:53.472
It would take at least.

526
00:57:55.266 --> 00:57:58.311
You're going to tell me or
I'm gonna beat it out of you.

527
00:57:58.351 --> 00:58:00.437
Oh. weapons of mass
destruction in here.

528
00:58:00.478 --> 00:58:03.773
You can't just go
around beating people up.

529
00:58:03.815 --> 00:58:04.942
Hey!

530
00:58:04.983 --> 00:58:06.277
Oh yeah. why not?

531
00:58:06.318 --> 00:58:10.780
Because. I have a Guggenheim.

532
00:58:10.822 --> 00:58:11.656
He's got a gun.

533
00:58:13.367 --> 00:58:15.536
It's not a gun. you idiot.

534
00:58:15.577 --> 00:58:18.998
Let that poor guy go
before he pisses himself.

535
00:58:19.039 --> 00:58:20.458
And go start those slash piles.

536
00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:21.541
Go on. get the work.

537
00:58:23.210 --> 00:58:26.296
What the hell you guys do. join
union while I was at lunch?

538
00:58:26.338 --> 00:58:27.547
Slash pile.

539
00:58:27.590 --> 00:58:30.843
We're just having a
little fun.

540
00:58:39.309 --> 00:58:40.101
Here comes that
hippie.

541
00:58:40.143 --> 00:58:41.102
you better get back to work.

542
00:58:42.605 --> 00:58:43.438
Hey!

543
00:58:44.898 --> 00:58:49.027
Hey. I want the names of those
men.

544
00:58:50.905 --> 00:58:51.739
No.

545
00:58:54.074 --> 00:58:55.701
You can have some coffee though.

546
00:59:08.047 --> 00:59:09.590
How long you been on the trail?

547
00:59:13.219 --> 00:59:15.012
Two weeks.

548
00:59:15.054 --> 00:59:17.557
Or no. longer maybe.

549
00:59:18.516 --> 00:59:19.307
I don't know.

550
00:59:19.349 --> 00:59:22.018
I. I. I guess I've lost track.

551
00:59:22.061 --> 00:59:25.439
Seems ill advised to be hiking
so long

552
00:59:25.481 --> 00:59:30.444
without a radio or a rifle.

553
00:59:30.735 --> 00:59:32.279
What if you run into a bear?

554
00:59:34.282 --> 00:59:35.115
I did.

555
00:59:37.367 --> 00:59:38.286
We worked it out.

556
00:59:39.579 --> 00:59:42.664
And the only dangerous animals
I've run into are your men.

557
00:59:44.416 --> 00:59:46.418
Well. you'll just have to
forgive them.

558
00:59:48.588 --> 00:59:51.132
They've been through an awful
lot these last few years.

559
00:59:51.173 --> 00:59:54.050
Thanks to this spotted owl
nonsense.

560
00:59:54.092 --> 00:59:55.677
Nonsense.

561
00:59:55.719 --> 00:59:58.471
You're talking about a species
that will never be back.

562
00:59:58.514 --> 01:00:00.391
We'll never see it again.

563
01:00:00.432 --> 01:00:03.059
Along with who knows how many
others.

564
01:00:03.101 --> 01:00:06.230
And once they're gone. that's
it.

565
01:00:06.271 --> 01:00:09.775
They're gone forever. okay.

566
01:00:09.817 --> 01:00:10.650
You don't.

567
01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:14.279
you don't get to snap your
fingers and have them come back.

568
01:00:14.322 --> 01:00:16.532
You know. there's no.
they're gone forever.

569
01:00:16.574 --> 01:00:19.452
And then all we have are
memories.

570
01:00:21.786 --> 01:00:24.581
Have you ever seen a spoted
owl?

571
01:00:24.623 --> 01:00:29.169
No. because they're very rare
because they're endangered.

572
01:00:30.128 --> 01:00:31.672
Well count your lucky stars.

573
01:00:33.548 --> 01:00:35.009
Mean sons of bitches.

574
01:00:36.052 --> 01:00:37.595
I'm glad to see them go.

575
01:00:37.637 --> 01:00:38.638
Hey. that's terrible.

576
01:00:38.679 --> 01:00:40.264
That's a terrible thing to say.

577
01:00:41.306 --> 01:00:43.600
I'm sure it is to someone like
you.

578
01:00:43.643 --> 01:00:44.644
Okay.

579
01:00:44.684 --> 01:00:48.021
Thanks to misinformed
do-gooders like yourself.

580
01:00:48.063 --> 01:00:50.649
There's too many trees. too much
brush.

581
01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:52.651
Too many regulations.

582
01:00:52.693 --> 01:00:53.528
Okay.

583
01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:57.615
Fewer plants mean fewer insects.

584
01:00:57.657 --> 01:00:59.492
Fewer insects mean fewer frogs
and birds.

585
01:00:59.534 --> 01:01:02.286
Fewer frogs and birds
means fewer larger mammals.

586
01:01:02.327 --> 01:01:05.331
Fewer of them means fewer of us.

587
01:01:05.373 --> 01:01:06.581
On that. we agree.

588
01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:08.626
Okay. good.

589
01:01:09.501 --> 01:01:10.335
Good.

590
01:01:11.795 --> 01:01:13.880
How. in what way?

591
01:01:13.922 --> 01:01:16.091
Now that we're not
able to thin the stands

592
01:01:16.132 --> 01:01:17.717
like we used to. like we should.

593
01:01:19.846 --> 01:01:22.431
every fire season nature does it
for us.

594
01:01:22.472 --> 01:01:26.518
Only her fires are faster and
longer than they used to be.

595
01:01:27.394 --> 01:01:31.356
Because there's 70 years of
fuel on the forest floor.

596
01:01:31.398 --> 01:01:33.984
It's only gonna get
worse and worse and worse

597
01:01:34.025 --> 01:01:36.319
till there ain't nothing left.

598
01:01:36.362 --> 01:01:38.697
And you'll probably
blame us for that. too.

599
01:01:41.367 --> 01:01:43.035
You ever heard of a rustic
bunty?

600
01:01:45.579 --> 01:01:46.413
I don't know.

601
01:01:47.748 --> 01:01:49.958
You remind me of a rustic
bunty.

602
01:01:52.043 --> 01:01:53.253
Saw one the other day.

603
01:01:55.172 --> 01:01:56.882
Brown bird about that big.

604
01:01:58.050 --> 01:01:59.552
Ought to be in Siberia.

605
01:02:00.969 --> 01:02:02.096
But here it was.

606
01:02:03.431 --> 01:02:06.474
Dumb little bird. stupid little
bird.

607
01:02:08.018 --> 01:02:10.979
Surprised if it lives
another week out here.

608
01:02:16.610 --> 01:02:18.737
Can I get another cup of
coffee. please.

609
01:02:23.117 --> 01:02:23.951
No.

610
01:02:26.746 --> 01:02:28.748
Drop the wood over
there.

611
01:02:32.876 --> 01:02:34.085

Hello. dinner and lunch.

635
01:11:50.141 --> 01:11:54.771
Hey. travel by motorized
vehicle is prohibited!

636
01:11:54.814 --> 01:11:57.024
Violators will be prosecuted!

637
01:11:59.234 --> 01:12:02.822
We're the
forest service. dumbass!

638
01:12:02.863 --> 01:12:04.447
Sorry. sorry.

639
01:12:05.365 --> 01:12:08.286
I didn't. it sounded.

640
01:12:12.331 --> 01:12:13.164
Hey.

641
01:12:14.542 --> 01:12:16.043
Peace offering.

642
01:12:16.085 --> 01:12:19.005
Not many chances for fresh water
between here and the gorge.

643
01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:21.673
Thank you.

644
01:12:26.511 --> 01:12:29.389
You're the butterfly guy?

645
01:12:29.431 --> 01:12:30.807
Huh?

646
01:12:30.850 --> 01:12:32.977
Not lot goes on that
we don't know about.

647
01:12:34.729 --> 01:12:36.521
You certainly seem to miss

648
01:12:36.564 --> 01:12:38.816
your fair share of motorized
vehicles.

649
01:12:39.859 --> 01:12:42.445
Hey. we're the only Rangers
for an area

650
01:12:42.485 --> 01:12:44.279
five times the size of
Manhattan.

651
01:12:51.078 --> 01:12:52.622
Wait. please.

652
01:12:52.662 --> 01:12:53.622
I have a question.

653
01:12:56.876 --> 01:12:58.002
Have you ever seen.

654
01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:02.215
Bigfoot?

655
01:13:03.298 --> 01:13:06.051
Yeah. you've got bigfoot fever
already.

656
01:13:06.092 --> 01:13:08.304
I get a few of you guys every
season.

657
01:13:08.345 --> 01:13:09.346
I'm just curious is all.

658
01:13:09.387 --> 01:13:10.222
Yeah. yeah.

659
01:13:11.431 --> 01:13:12.265
Do you believe?

660
01:13:13.684 --> 01:13:15.561
I've never seen a spotted owl.

661
01:13:15.603 --> 01:13:18.146
but I know they're around here
somewhere.

662
01:13:19.273 --> 01:13:20.106
Why not bigfoot?

663
01:13:21.943 --> 01:13:25.363
I mean. if you were one of
them. wouldn't you hide from us?

664
01:13:27.907 --> 01:13:28.908
I know I would.

665
01:13:31.827 --> 01:13:34.329
Pace yourself with that water.

666
01:14:35.765 --> 01:14:37.475
This is North.

667
01:14:37.518 --> 01:14:38.810
No. this is North.

668
01:14:40.188 --> 01:14:42.273
That's not. okay no I'm.

669
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:45.483
I should be North of here.

670
01:14:54.534 --> 01:14:55.994
Missed the trail.

671
01:14:57.747 --> 01:14:59.123
Oh god. of course.

672
01:14:59.164 --> 01:15:00.666
Lava beds are magnetic.

673
01:15:16.265 --> 01:15:18.518
Okay. let's go climb a tree.

674
01:16:19.578 --> 01:16:20.412
Hey. hey!

675
01:16:22.747 --> 01:16:24.583
Sorry. I'm lost.

676
01:16:53.945 --> 01:16:54.947
Where is it?

677
01:16:56.740 --> 01:16:58.951
It's around here somewhere.

678
01:19:48.912 --> 01:19:49.746
Oh wow.

679
01:19:56.628 --> 01:19:57.462
Wonderful.

680
01:20:09.350 --> 01:20:10.184
Wow.

684
01:21:41.067 --> 01:21:41.859
Oh!

685
01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:44.987
Ow. oh!

686
01:21:53.078 --> 01:21:58.083
Oh God!

687
01:22:38.373 --> 01:22:39.207
What?

688
01:23:00.479 --> 01:23:01.314
Help!

689
01:23:02.189 --> 01:23:03.356
Help. help me.

690
01:23:04.774 --> 01:23:05.609
Help me!

691
01:23:06.819 --> 01:23:07.987
Help. come on.

692
01:23:43.523 --> 01:23:44.356
Okay.

693
01:23:46.024 --> 01:23:46.858
Okay.

694
01:23:47.693 --> 01:23:48.819
You were right.

695
01:23:52.698 --> 01:23:53.740
It's a little funny.

696
01:24:04.377 --> 01:24:05.711
It's sort of funny.

697
01:24:08.965 --> 01:24:09.798
