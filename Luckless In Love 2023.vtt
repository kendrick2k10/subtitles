3
00:00:30.247 --> 00:00:32.293
Okay. well. this is me.

4
00:00:34.121 --> 00:00:35.426
Okay.

5
00:00:37.124 --> 00:00:39.952
Okay. bye!

6
00:00:40.127 --> 00:00:41.476
Thanks.

7
00:00:54.315 --> 00:00:56.926
No. I think you're gonna
love it. actually.

8
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.754
Mm.
Here we are.

9
00:01:21.516 --> 00:01:24.954
Oh. hey roomie. How'd it go?

10
00:01:25.128 --> 00:01:27.348
Ugh. another dating nightmare.
Oh.

11
00:01:27.522 --> 00:01:29.132
More blog fodder though.
Ooh. and he definitely lied

12
00:01:29.306 --> 00:01:30.916
about his height on his profile.

13
00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:32.875
Wait. unless he was using
the metric system.

14
00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:34.877
Well. at least you're getting

15
00:01:35.051 --> 00:01:39.055
fresh new material
for Luckless. right?

16
00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.971
True.
Here you go. Cheers.

17
00:01:42.145 --> 00:01:43.277
Cheers.

18
00:01:43.451 --> 00:01:44.582
Okay.

19
00:01:44.756 --> 00:01:46.236
Mm!

20
00:01:48.195 --> 00:01:50.501
That is disgusting.

21
00:01:50.675 --> 00:01:51.763
Okay.

22
00:01:55.854 --> 00:01:57.987
Uh. yeah. cheers...

23
00:01:58.161 --> 00:02:00.076
to a great first date.

24
00:02:03.297 --> 00:02:04.559
Or not.

25
00:02:06.735 --> 00:02:07.736
Who's that?

26
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:09.912
That's my son.

27
00:02:10.086 --> 00:02:11.957
Hey! Ty.

28
00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:13.350
You're home early.

29
00:02:13.524 --> 00:02:14.482
Yeah. our coach
let us out early.

30
00:02:14.656 --> 00:02:16.266
Ah.
Mm...

31
00:02:17.311 --> 00:02:19.617
Do we have any extra Thai food?

32
00:02:24.231 --> 00:02:25.884
So what's your name?

33
00:02:26.058 --> 00:02:28.931
Brittany.
Oh. Brittany.

34
00:02:29.105 --> 00:02:31.499
Brittany. Brittany. Brittany.
Be serious.

35
00:02:31.673 --> 00:02:33.196
But he's a single dad.

36
00:02:34.545 --> 00:02:37.026
He's what. at least eight years
older than you. like...

37
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.028
Do you really wanna be dealing
with me all the time?

38
00:02:39.202 --> 00:02:41.117
I'm going through puberty
as we speak.

39
00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:43.685
And I'm a nightmare.
he knows it.

40
00:02:44.251 --> 00:02:45.948
You really wanna waste
your twenties

41
00:02:46.122 --> 00:02:47.558
trying to be my step-mom?

42
00:02:47.732 --> 00:02:49.299
Ha! Okay. yeah.

43
00:02:49.473 --> 00:02:51.083
There's a reasonable explanation
why I didn't...

44
00:02:51.258 --> 00:02:53.129
And you don't really
have to go but...

45
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.089
She's gone.

46
00:02:59.614 --> 00:03:00.832
She seemed nice.
Yeah.

47
00:03:01.006 --> 00:03:02.921
Actress?
Dancer. actually.

48
00:03:03.095 --> 00:03:04.184
Shocking.
Shocking.

49
00:03:04.358 --> 00:03:06.447
Yeah. lots of shocks tonight.

50
00:03:06.621 --> 00:03:09.101
Um. hey. you.

51
00:03:09.276 --> 00:03:11.278
You know that nice. fancy
expensive cell phone I go you?

52
00:03:11.452 --> 00:03:16.239
Well. you can use that
to like. call or text me.

53
00:03:16.413 --> 00:03:18.459
tell me you're coming early.

54
00:03:18.633 --> 00:03:21.418
maybe. and then we just...
we'd have less shocks.

55
00:03:21.592 --> 00:03:23.159
Mm. You know what?
I was thinking that.

56
00:03:23.333 --> 00:03:24.987
but I was like.
"He's probably busy.

57
00:03:25.161 --> 00:03:26.075
I don't want to interrupt."

58
00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:27.076
I was busy?
Yeah.

59
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.252
Who knew? Not you.

60
00:03:29.426 --> 00:03:32.124
'Cause you didn't call me.

61
00:03:39.175 --> 00:03:40.959
What's up with you?

62
00:03:41.133 --> 00:03:43.005
Come on. out with it.

63
00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:45.137
Can I. uh...
Can I have some money?

64
00:03:45.312 --> 00:03:48.010
There's a school dance.
tickets go on sale today. so...

65
00:03:48.184 --> 00:03:49.968
Are you finally
gonna ask that girl out?

66
00:03:50.142 --> 00:03:52.623
Uh. yeah. I think so.

67
00:03:53.145 --> 00:03:55.104
Hm. There you are.

68
00:03:55.278 --> 00:03:56.671
Thanks.
Hey.

69
00:03:56.845 --> 00:03:58.020
You got this.

70
00:03:58.194 --> 00:04:01.110
Yeah. I'll see ya later.
Yeah.

71
00:04:02.198 --> 00:04:05.854
Okay. so while you were off
on your date with Napoleon.

72
00:04:06.028 --> 00:04:08.204
Inga had me taste test
not one. not two.

73
00:04:08.378 --> 00:04:11.033
but five raw only restaurants
this weekend.

74
00:04:11.207 --> 00:04:14.166
I never want to see an uncooked
carrot in my life. okay?

75
00:04:14.341 --> 00:04:17.169
Oh. oh. Hey. uh.
you dropped this.

76
00:04:17.344 --> 00:04:21.043
Oh. Thank you.
that would have been bad.

77
00:04:21.217 --> 00:04:22.914
School dance tickets
go on sale today. so...

78
00:04:23.088 --> 00:04:24.438
Oh.
Well. good luck.

79
00:04:24.612 --> 00:04:26.831
I hope whoever
you're asking says yes.

80
00:04:27.005 --> 00:04:28.877
Yeah. Me too.

81
00:04:29.051 --> 00:04:30.270
Thanks. Bye.
Bye.

82
00:04:30.444 --> 00:04:32.054
Aw. sweet kid.

83
00:04:32.228 --> 00:04:35.057
My blog barely has
any readers and my mother...

84
00:04:35.231 --> 00:04:36.537
my mother is now officially

85
00:04:36.711 --> 00:04:39.061
calling me her spinster
daughter.

86
00:04:39.235 --> 00:04:41.193
Spinster. Like I'm.
I don't know.

87
00:04:41.368 --> 00:04:43.544
some kind of Victorian recluse.
Okay.

88
00:04:43.718 --> 00:04:45.372
I actually kind of like that.

89
00:04:45.546 --> 00:04:47.896
It's like you're
a poisonous spider

90
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.898
trying to trap a man
in a web. right?

91
00:04:50.072 --> 00:04:53.205
Or. I'm a writer
with a failing dating blog.

92
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.903
You know what?

93
00:04:55.077 --> 00:04:58.341
Your post about the gym guy
was really fun.

94
00:04:58.515 --> 00:05:00.822
Oh. And he spent three hours

95
00:05:00.996 --> 00:05:03.912
extolling the merits
of calf implants.

96
00:05:04.086 --> 00:05:06.088
Oh. yeah.
You know what?

97
00:05:06.262 --> 00:05:08.873
At least we can revel
in how beautiful

98
00:05:09.047 --> 00:05:11.180
the city is in the spring time.

99
00:05:11.354 --> 00:05:12.660
Mm-hmm.

100
00:05:12.834 --> 00:05:17.665
Well. I would rather
revel in that.

101
00:05:18.187 --> 00:05:20.972
You are shameless.
Turn around.

102
00:05:21.146 --> 00:05:22.626
I'm not--
And we're late.

103
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.498
And you've got some drool like.
right there.

104
00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:30.025
Ladies!

105
00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:33.202
All staff meeting
in the sanctuary. please.

106
00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:35.596
Now!

107
00:05:36.727 --> 00:05:38.207
Here we go.

108
00:05:38.381 --> 00:05:40.122
Another round of pre-summer
weight loss plans

109
00:05:40.296 --> 00:05:42.690
and obscenely priced
travel guides.

110
00:05:43.604 --> 00:05:46.563
It's like the swimsuit season
prep brings out the um...

111
00:05:46.737 --> 00:05:49.479
demon inside of her.

112
00:05:49.653 --> 00:05:51.960
You know what. maybe this year
she'll want something new.

113
00:05:52.134 --> 00:05:54.092
You know. maybe fiction?
Yeah.

114
00:05:54.266 --> 00:05:57.922
Or maybe pigs will fly.

115
00:05:58.096 --> 00:05:59.663
Okay.

116
00:05:59.837 --> 00:06:02.884
Okay! Kyra. I'm going to need
some recipes

117
00:06:03.058 --> 00:06:05.452
for vegan baked goods
for lifestyle.

118
00:06:05.626 --> 00:06:07.932
And please do not send me
anything else

119
00:06:08.106 --> 00:06:10.935
with dates in them.
you know I abhor dates.

120
00:06:11.109 --> 00:06:12.415
They make my thighs bloat.

121
00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:14.939
Right. I hate it
when that happens.

122
00:06:15.113 --> 00:06:19.204
Um. can I just ask you one
question. Inga?

123
00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:22.425
Uh. can I use...

124
00:06:24.122 --> 00:06:25.994
...sugar this time?

125
00:06:26.168 --> 00:06:28.126
Kyra. is it 1985?!

126
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.302
N-No. it's not.

127
00:06:30.477 --> 00:06:33.088
Okay. Moving on!

128
00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:37.397
Jen. Hi. I'm gonna need you to.
uh. take over advice.

129
00:06:37.571 --> 00:06:39.616
"Spring Fling: Single Ladies."

130
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.618
We're really ramping up
our spring dating issue

131
00:06:41.792 --> 00:06:43.141
and I want you to spearhead it.

132
00:06:43.315 --> 00:06:44.795
Uh. Inga.

133
00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:46.623
Sorry. I just like.
kind of thought that.

134
00:06:46.797 --> 00:06:48.973
you know. I was gonna
tackle that--

135
00:06:49.147 --> 00:06:52.107
No. Winnie. I'll give you
something more manageable.

136
00:06:52.281 --> 00:06:54.196
Facial oils.

137
00:06:55.066 --> 00:06:56.807
Facial oils?

138
00:06:57.286 --> 00:06:59.288
The oil that you put
on your face.

139
00:06:59.462 --> 00:07:00.550
Right. Yeah.
Hydrates.

140
00:07:00.724 --> 00:07:03.074
I love facial... oils. Inga.

141
00:07:03.248 --> 00:07:05.250
Perfect! Write a piece on it.

142
00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:06.687
Yeah.

143
00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:10.081
Enter!

144
00:07:10.255 --> 00:07:11.169
Oh.

145
00:07:11.343 --> 00:07:12.997
Hi. Inga.

146
00:07:13.171 --> 00:07:14.999
Hello. Winnie.

147
00:07:15.173 --> 00:07:17.001
I was hoping to talk to you
about my column.

148
00:07:19.569 --> 00:07:21.353
You're just not relatable.
dear.

149
00:07:21.528 --> 00:07:25.183
I mean. everything you write
is just so... boring.

150
00:07:25.357 --> 00:07:27.055
Okay...

151
00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:31.189
There's nothing personal
or interesting about your work.

152
00:07:31.363 --> 00:07:33.496
You may as well be
an algorithm at this point.

153
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.412
Well. I actually. uh.
have a blog on the side

154
00:07:36.586 --> 00:07:38.066
where I write about
dating anonymously.

155
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.546
It's called Luckless.

156
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.069
And?

157
00:07:41.243 --> 00:07:43.375
Well. I mean.
I think that's relatable.

158
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:44.899
You know. maybe that's...

159
00:07:45.073 --> 00:07:46.727
that's what our readers
need. Inga.

160
00:07:46.901 --> 00:07:48.337
to read about women who don't
have it all figured out.

161
00:07:48.511 --> 00:07:50.252
who don't have all
the answers to dating--

162
00:07:50.426 --> 00:07:52.167
Oh. Winnie. Winnie. Winnie.
let me stop you right there.

163
00:07:52.341 --> 00:07:55.083
because you have to remember
that our readers come to us

164
00:07:55.257 --> 00:07:58.434
for aspirational content. yes.

165
00:07:58.608 --> 00:08:00.958
not to hear about
your sad little dates.

166
00:08:01.132 --> 00:08:03.831
And sorry.
was I not perfectly clear

167
00:08:04.005 --> 00:08:07.051
that I expect my writers
to focus entirely

168
00:08:07.225 --> 00:08:08.357
on their Mush content?

169
00:08:08.531 --> 00:08:10.925
Yeah. I know. but I--
No buts.

170
00:08:11.099 --> 00:08:14.798
Now you have a piece to write
on facial oils.

171
00:08:14.972 --> 00:08:16.539
Off you go!

172
00:08:16.713 --> 00:08:18.585
I hear that's fabulous.
by the way.

173
00:08:18.759 --> 00:08:21.979
Peppermint under-eye.
revitalize...

174
00:08:29.421 --> 00:08:30.901
Morning!

175
00:08:31.075 --> 00:08:32.990
Dirk Perkins!

176
00:08:33.164 --> 00:08:36.254
Don't you ever knock?
I can sign this guy. Ret.

177
00:08:36.428 --> 00:08:39.040
Every sports agent in the city
wants to sign Dirk Perkins.

178
00:08:40.258 --> 00:08:43.305
From what I hear.
he's a petulant little zit.

179
00:08:44.654 --> 00:08:47.222
Hey!
He might be a little zit.

180
00:08:47.396 --> 00:08:52.053
but he's gonna make us
a lot of money.

181
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.578
If you're gonna take over
my company.

182
00:08:55.752 --> 00:08:57.319
you gotta do more
than sign Dirk.

183
00:08:57.493 --> 00:08:59.843
Dirk Perkins is gonna be
the greatest baseball player

184
00:09:00.017 --> 00:09:02.803
since Mickey Mantle.
We gotta sign him.

185
00:09:02.977 --> 00:09:04.456
That overconfident
little punk

186
00:09:04.631 --> 00:09:06.937
will never be as great
as Mickey. You got that?

187
00:09:07.111 --> 00:09:08.939
If you wanna sign him.
go sign him.

188
00:09:09.113 --> 00:09:10.941
Just quit bugging me.

189
00:09:11.115 --> 00:09:12.552
You're gonna thank me one day.

190
00:09:14.423 --> 00:09:16.294
Uh. Ret.
Mm-hmm.

191
00:09:16.468 --> 00:09:18.166
Are those the tickets
to the Insiders Gala?

192
00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.342
They sure are.
Perfect. because I think

193
00:09:20.516 --> 00:09:22.474
that would be the greatest place
to butter up Dirk.

194
00:09:22.649 --> 00:09:24.955
You know. a little glitz.
a little glam.

195
00:09:25.129 --> 00:09:27.001
hob nob with the creme
de la creme of the city.

196
00:09:27.175 --> 00:09:29.177
bada bing. bada boom.
wheeling and dealing.

197
00:09:29.351 --> 00:09:30.657
Uh. about that...

198
00:09:30.831 --> 00:09:32.093
There's something
we need to discuss.

199
00:09:32.267 --> 00:09:33.485
Shoot.

200
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.139
You hungry?

201
00:09:36.663 --> 00:09:38.186
I think it might be good for you

202
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.883
to sit out
the Insiders Gala this year.

203
00:09:40.057 --> 00:09:41.842
Hilarious.

204
00:09:42.016 --> 00:09:43.495
Nice one. Ret.

205
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:45.410
I'm serious.

206
00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:46.934
What?

207
00:09:47.108 --> 00:09:48.936
Sit it out?

208
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:51.025
As in. I'm not invited? But...

209
00:09:51.199 --> 00:09:53.854
Ret. I represent the agency.
we always go.

210
00:09:54.028 --> 00:09:55.986
How can I put this?

211
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.120
You ruin the gala.
Every year. Without fail.

212
00:09:59.294 --> 00:10:02.558
No. the... last year
that famous singer guy and I

213
00:10:02.732 --> 00:10:05.213
danced for like two hours.
You danced for two minutes

214
00:10:05.387 --> 00:10:07.389
and then you left with that
Victoria's Secret model

215
00:10:07.563 --> 00:10:09.913
who wasn't even your date.
So?

216
00:10:10.087 --> 00:10:13.613
She was that famous
singer guy's girlfriend.

217
00:10:15.092 --> 00:10:16.703
What's the problem?

218
00:10:16.877 --> 00:10:19.662
When are you gonna stop
acting like a kid. huh?

219
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.405
Don't you want a real
relationship?

220
00:10:23.579 --> 00:10:26.103
For Ty. Something serious.

221
00:10:26.582 --> 00:10:28.366
You must be tired
of all this running around.

222
00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.325
and I'm sure Ty is too.

223
00:10:30.499 --> 00:10:33.110
Listen. Ty and I
are doing fine on our own

224
00:10:33.284 --> 00:10:35.330
and I don't want to go
to the gala to flirt with women.

225
00:10:36.244 --> 00:10:37.637
Dirk Perkins is the biggest
prospect.

226
00:10:37.811 --> 00:10:39.377
Ret. if you...

227
00:10:39.551 --> 00:10:41.031
if you're worried
about me taking over.

228
00:10:41.205 --> 00:10:42.946
you don't have to.
because I know the company

229
00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.383
inside and out.
but I've got to be at the gala

230
00:10:45.557 --> 00:10:46.907
to cash in on Dirk.

231
00:10:47.081 --> 00:10:48.735
Not this year. Holden.
Come on.

232
00:10:48.909 --> 00:10:51.128
what do I gotta do to prove
to you I can handle this?

233
00:10:53.522 --> 00:10:55.089
What?

234
00:10:58.745 --> 00:11:00.094
What are you scheming?

235
00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:03.619
I have a proposition.
Okay.

236
00:11:03.793 --> 00:11:06.840
The gala is in exactly
one month.

237
00:11:07.014 --> 00:11:08.885
Why not find a girl

238
00:11:09.059 --> 00:11:11.105
and try dating seriously?

239
00:11:12.106 --> 00:11:13.934
You're predicating
my attendance

240
00:11:14.108 --> 00:11:15.892
on my ability
to find a girlfriend?

241
00:11:16.066 --> 00:11:18.373
Mm-hmm.
Okay. Piece of cake.

242
00:11:18.547 --> 00:11:21.550
No. I wanna see you actually
take a girl seriously.

243
00:11:21.724 --> 00:11:24.596
Maybe even fall in love
if you're lucky.

244
00:11:24.771 --> 00:11:27.599
Look. if you want
to take over my company.

245
00:11:27.774 --> 00:11:29.950
I gotta see real commitment.

246
00:11:30.124 --> 00:11:31.778
Bring her to dinner
the night before the gala

247
00:11:31.952 --> 00:11:35.956
and I'll decide then if you've
formed a real connection.

248
00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.480
Do that. then you can come.

249
00:11:42.832 --> 00:11:45.966
No. Ret. there's got
to be another option.

250
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.532
Just...

251
00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:50.535
go for someone you
wouldn't usually go for.

252
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.494
You can do it.

253
00:11:56.628 --> 00:11:59.066
Ow. ow. ow. ow. ow!

254
00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.894
Are you okay?
Ugh!

255
00:12:01.068 --> 00:12:03.157
Inga is killing me with this
face oil article. I mean.

256
00:12:03.331 --> 00:12:05.289
peppermint does not belong
anywhere near your eyes.

257
00:12:05.463 --> 00:12:07.857
Oh. it feels like
I just maced myself. Ugh!

258
00:12:08.031 --> 00:12:09.598
Here. try this.
Oh. thank you.

259
00:12:09.772 --> 00:12:11.165
Mm.

260
00:12:13.167 --> 00:12:14.908
Ugh...

261
00:12:15.082 --> 00:12:16.344
Tastes like rocks.

262
00:12:16.518 --> 00:12:18.520
Okay. well. you try inventing

263
00:12:18.694 --> 00:12:21.523
a calorie-free pastry. okay?

264
00:12:21.697 --> 00:12:23.525
Yeah. well. at least she's
letting you keep your column.

265
00:12:23.699 --> 00:12:27.007
I mean. she said my writing
isn't personal.

266
00:12:27.181 --> 00:12:30.271
Forget Inga.
Mush is just a job.

267
00:12:30.445 --> 00:12:32.621
You should focus
on your own projects.

268
00:12:32.795 --> 00:12:34.362
Ooh. like your blog.

269
00:12:34.536 --> 00:12:37.060
Oh my gosh!
Hey!

270
00:12:37.234 --> 00:12:42.805
You should write something
for Mush on Luckless.

271
00:12:44.546 --> 00:12:46.417
Like what?
Okay.

272
00:12:46.591 --> 00:12:50.378
So you think your dating life
is a disaster and yes. it is.

273
00:12:50.552 --> 00:12:54.121
But it's actually
pretty entertaining.

274
00:12:54.295 --> 00:12:58.125
Ooh. maybe you just need to find

275
00:12:58.299 --> 00:13:01.606
the perfect Mush guy.

276
00:13:04.261 --> 00:13:07.177
Yeah. you know.
that's not a bad idea.

277
00:13:07.351 --> 00:13:09.397
Right?
Yeah. I can find a guy

278
00:13:09.571 --> 00:13:12.226
who I know girls like me
have dated before.

279
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.880
someone who Inga
finds aspirational.

280
00:13:14.054 --> 00:13:15.925
Yes.

281
00:13:16.099 --> 00:13:19.450
But I mean. what kind of
a guy has every girl dated?

282
00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:23.150
A commitment-phobic man-child.

283
00:13:23.324 --> 00:13:24.760
Yup.
Yeah.

284
00:13:26.762 --> 00:13:28.372
Oh. Oh. wow.
Mm-mm.

285
00:13:28.546 --> 00:13:30.200
Mm-mm.

286
00:13:30.374 --> 00:13:31.985
I'm going to throw those out.
That's disgusting.

287
00:13:32.159 --> 00:13:35.249
Let's go find this guy.
Yes! Yes!

288
00:13:38.556 --> 00:13:40.384
I mean...

289
00:13:41.255 --> 00:13:43.605
We're the two musketeers. right?

290
00:13:43.779 --> 00:13:45.520
We don't need some lady
coming in here

291
00:13:45.694 --> 00:13:46.913
and messing up our guy's things.

292
00:13:47.087 --> 00:13:49.089
we are the kings
of our own castle.

293
00:13:49.263 --> 00:13:52.005
Where are you going with this?
So. I know you're not thrilled

294
00:13:52.179 --> 00:13:54.311
about some of the women
I've dated but Ret is insisting

295
00:13:54.485 --> 00:13:57.227
that I give looking for
a serious girlfriend a try.

296
00:13:57.401 --> 00:13:59.621
I mean. it's really important
'cause I gotta sign

297
00:13:59.795 --> 00:14:02.015
this prospect. and I've got
to do it at a gala--

298
00:14:02.189 --> 00:14:04.931
So. okay. so Ret wants you
to have a girlfriend

299
00:14:05.105 --> 00:14:09.109
so that you can go to the gala
and sign that Dirk guy?

300
00:14:09.283 --> 00:14:10.937
Yeah.

301
00:14:11.111 --> 00:14:12.677
I say do it.

302
00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:14.984
You know. just find someone
that Ret will like

303
00:14:15.158 --> 00:14:18.292
and then. after that.
we can go back to normal.

304
00:14:18.466 --> 00:14:19.946
Two musketeers. right?

305
00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.991
And you're okay with this?

306
00:14:22.165 --> 00:14:23.863
Yeah. whatever.

307
00:14:24.037 --> 00:14:25.952
Sometimes I swear
you're a 40-year-old man

308
00:14:26.126 --> 00:14:27.257
stuck in a teenager's body.

309
00:14:27.431 --> 00:14:29.085
Gross.

310
00:14:29.259 --> 00:14:31.479
Alright. you want to. uh.
help me pick one?

311
00:14:31.653 --> 00:14:33.263
Uh. duh.
Alright.

312
00:14:33.437 --> 00:14:35.309
Well. she's got to be
the serious type.

313
00:14:35.483 --> 00:14:37.877
Oh. what about her?

314
00:14:38.051 --> 00:14:39.922
Uh. yeah. so.
how about I handle this.

315
00:14:40.096 --> 00:14:41.619
you handle homework?

316
00:14:41.793 --> 00:14:43.447
That's lame.

317
00:14:45.797 --> 00:14:48.670
Well. here goes nothing.

318
00:14:51.803 --> 00:14:53.544
Okay.
Let's see here.

319
00:14:53.718 --> 00:14:55.285
Here we go!

320
00:14:55.459 --> 00:14:56.460
Him?

321
00:14:56.634 --> 00:14:58.506
Okay. Nice moustache.

322
00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.290
But you know what? Too artsy.

323
00:15:00.464 --> 00:15:02.466
He looks like he would spend
all night quoting Kafka.

324
00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:03.990
[chuckles]

325
00:15:04.164 --> 00:15:06.122
Oh. What about him?

326
00:15:07.036 --> 00:15:08.864
Oh. Wait a minute.

327
00:15:09.038 --> 00:15:12.520
isn't that the hot guy
from the coffee shop?

328
00:15:12.694 --> 00:15:14.522
Do it right now before I do.

329
00:15:14.696 --> 00:15:16.045
Come on.
Okay.

330
00:15:20.049 --> 00:15:22.269
He messaged me.
He wants to meet.

331
00:15:22.443 --> 00:15:25.315
Wow. he moves fast.

332
00:15:26.403 --> 00:15:29.319
Operation let's make
Luckless Mush approved...

333
00:15:29.493 --> 00:15:30.886
ah-begins!

334
00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:32.235
Okay. Here we go!
Wish me luck!

335
00:15:32.409 --> 00:15:34.324
Good luck!
I'm going on a date!

336
00:15:34.498 --> 00:15:37.110
Yes!

337
00:15:37.284 --> 00:15:40.113
That guy is so hot.

338
00:15:45.379 --> 00:15:48.164
Uh. hi. Winnie?

339
00:15:48.686 --> 00:15:50.384
That's funny. I think
I saw you the other day.

340
00:15:50.558 --> 00:15:52.212
Uh. yes. You must be Holden.

341
00:15:52.386 --> 00:15:54.083
Hi.
Hi.

342
00:15:54.257 --> 00:15:56.651
Uh. this is the place.
They do great live music.

343
00:15:56.825 --> 00:15:59.523
I think it's jazz tonight.
not my preferred genre. but--

344
00:15:59.697 --> 00:16:01.961
Perfect. I love jazz.
I actually used to sing

345
00:16:02.135 --> 00:16:04.354
in a jazz club in college.
Oh. God. really?

346
00:16:04.528 --> 00:16:06.922
No. not me.
Terrified of singing.

347
00:16:07.096 --> 00:16:08.924
Oh. anyone
can be taught to sing.

348
00:16:09.098 --> 00:16:11.448
Like teaching a dog
how to walk on its hind legs.

349
00:16:12.536 --> 00:16:15.235
Shall we?
Jinx.

350
00:16:15.409 --> 00:16:18.107
So. what kind of things
do you write?

351
00:16:18.281 --> 00:16:19.848
Well. I actually work
for a women's

352
00:16:20.022 --> 00:16:21.937
lifestyle brand. Mush.
right now.

353
00:16:22.111 --> 00:16:24.244
But I'd like to write
fiction novels some day.

354
00:16:24.418 --> 00:16:26.072
Cool. Cool. cool. cool.

355
00:16:26.246 --> 00:16:29.075
Um. I'm an agent. Sports agent.

356
00:16:29.249 --> 00:16:32.078
Represent a few all-stars.
Alex Halsey on speed dial.

357
00:16:32.252 --> 00:16:33.993
no big deal.

358
00:16:34.776 --> 00:16:37.257
Hm.
The pitcher.

359
00:16:37.431 --> 00:16:38.998
Mm-hmm.

360
00:16:40.695 --> 00:16:43.089
Oh. hey...

361
00:16:43.263 --> 00:16:44.438
Christie?

362
00:16:44.612 --> 00:16:46.440
Brittany!
Brittany!

363
00:16:46.614 --> 00:16:48.137
Brittany. right.

364
00:16:48.311 --> 00:16:50.835
Uh. Winnie. this is Brittany.
Brittany. Winnie.

365
00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.402
Hi.

366
00:16:53.186 --> 00:16:54.970
I really wished you would have
just told me about--

367
00:16:55.144 --> 00:16:56.972
You know. Brittany.
we are actually on a date.

368
00:16:57.146 --> 00:16:59.279
so this is not the right time--
Oh. no. no. no. Don't mind me.

369
00:16:59.453 --> 00:17:00.932
This is great. Uh. Brit...

370
00:17:01.107 --> 00:17:03.152
what did he not
tell you about exactly?

371
00:17:03.326 --> 00:17:05.981
She's not important...
It's not important. Um...

372
00:17:06.155 --> 00:17:09.202
It was one date. so let's not
make this a bigger thing

373
00:17:09.376 --> 00:17:11.552
than it actually is.

374
00:17:19.125 --> 00:17:20.648
That's gin and tonic.

375
00:17:20.822 --> 00:17:22.954
So. what did you not
tell her about exactly?

376
00:17:23.129 --> 00:17:26.871
Um. we went on...
we went on one... one date.

377
00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:28.482
it's really not important.

378
00:17:28.656 --> 00:17:31.093
Okay. Well. I have
what I need.

379
00:17:32.138 --> 00:17:33.443
Ugh.

380
00:17:34.618 --> 00:17:36.968
I mean. what's the big deal?
We went on one date!

381
00:17:37.143 --> 00:17:38.883
I haven't even seen her since!

382
00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:42.017
Oh. and her fury just totally
came out of left field?

383
00:17:42.191 --> 00:17:43.845
What did you mislead her about?
Women don't go around just

384
00:17:44.019 --> 00:17:46.326
dousing men in overpriced
cocktails for not reason.

385
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.849
Well. apparently
in my experience.

386
00:17:48.023 --> 00:17:50.156
sometimes they do.
Okay. so. you just

387
00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:51.940
go out with women.
hide something big from them.

388
00:17:52.114 --> 00:17:53.289
and then never
talk to them again?

389
00:17:53.463 --> 00:17:55.291
Yeah. I've dated around.
So what?

390
00:17:55.465 --> 00:17:57.641
You are a walking cliché.

391
00:17:57.815 --> 00:17:59.034
Yeah. women like you
are exhausting.

392
00:17:59.208 --> 00:18:00.775
Oh. I'm exhausting?!
Yeah!

393
00:18:00.949 --> 00:18:03.995
I'm sorry. I wasn't the one
who just had an ex-lover

394
00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:05.823
pour a drink on me!
An ex-lover?!

395
00:18:05.997 --> 00:18:07.129
Yeah!
Hiya.

396
00:18:07.303 --> 00:18:08.826
Oh. there's another one.

397
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.001
Yeah. why don't you two
have a great night?

398
00:18:10.176 --> 00:18:11.177
Fine!
Fine!

399
00:18:11.351 --> 00:18:12.961
Go. you giant-eyed.

400
00:18:13.135 --> 00:18:15.050
stuck-up jazz lady!

401
00:18:15.224 --> 00:18:18.097
Fine you. you...
you lothario! Ha!

402
00:18:18.271 --> 00:18:20.011
Oh. an old-timey insult

403
00:18:20.186 --> 00:18:21.839
that I'm not even really sure
I understand!

404
00:18:22.013 --> 00:18:23.102
How will I ever recover?

405
00:18:23.276 --> 00:18:24.712
Good night!

406
00:18:31.066 --> 00:18:32.937
Um. I'm guessing
it went pretty much

407
00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:34.809
how we expected it would?

408
00:18:34.983 --> 00:18:36.985
He's Satan. Kyra.

409
00:18:37.159 --> 00:18:38.073
Satan.

410
00:18:38.247 --> 00:18:40.293
That's why he's so hot.

411
00:18:40.467 --> 00:18:43.557
Oh. you have no idea.

412
00:18:43.731 --> 00:18:46.429
Well. happy writing
Miss Luckless.

413
00:18:59.399 --> 00:19:01.401
How's that for personal?

414
00:19:19.419 --> 00:19:20.898
Hey.
Hey.

415
00:19:21.072 --> 00:19:22.073
You okay?

416
00:19:22.248 --> 00:19:24.206
You look tired. are you hungry?

417
00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:25.903
Do you need a snack?

418
00:19:26.077 --> 00:19:27.427
No. and that's just
a polite way

419
00:19:27.601 --> 00:19:30.125
to say I look horrible.
Okay...

420
00:19:31.605 --> 00:19:33.911
Don't freak out. Okay?
Okay.

421
00:19:34.085 --> 00:19:36.087
Inga would like
to speak to you

422
00:19:36.262 --> 00:19:38.873
in her office alone right now.

423
00:19:39.047 --> 00:19:40.962
Why? Why. why. why?
I don't know.

424
00:19:41.136 --> 00:19:43.269
She just insisted
that I send you in to see her

425
00:19:43.443 --> 00:19:45.445
when you got in.
Maybe she just wants

426
00:19:45.619 --> 00:19:47.142
to talk to you
about your fiction work.

427
00:19:47.316 --> 00:19:49.579
You think? Really?
No. I'm sorry.

428
00:19:49.753 --> 00:19:50.928
I'm just trying to make
you feel better

429
00:19:51.102 --> 00:19:52.713
and I'm really stressed out.

430
00:19:54.018 --> 00:19:56.282
Ah! Oh...

431
00:19:56.456 --> 00:19:58.066
Yeah. Okay.

432
00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.938
Pierre. can you stop
sneaking up on me like that?

433
00:20:01.112 --> 00:20:02.897
I will be right there.

434
00:20:03.071 --> 00:20:05.421
Okay. Don't worry.

435
00:20:05.595 --> 00:20:08.598
Okay. Kyra.
What if she saw my blog?

436
00:20:08.772 --> 00:20:10.121
Oh. what if she saw my blog?
Mm-mm.

437
00:20:10.296 --> 00:20:11.949
There's no way
that she saw the blog.

438
00:20:12.123 --> 00:20:14.256
Nobody reads the blog

439
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:16.127
except me and weird Greg in 5-C.

440
00:20:16.302 --> 00:20:18.956
Ouch.

441
00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.176
Sorry. And Crazy Carl in 6-S.

442
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:22.482
Oh. thank you.
Nice guy!

443
00:20:22.656 --> 00:20:24.223
Yeah.
Yeah.

444
00:20:30.229 --> 00:20:32.100
Ah!

445
00:20:32.274 --> 00:20:34.189
Why are you screaming?

446
00:20:34.581 --> 00:20:36.974
Sorry. just.
your hand looked. um...

447
00:20:37.148 --> 00:20:38.454
You wanted to see me?

448
00:20:38.628 --> 00:20:41.414
It's for cell regeneration...

449
00:20:41.588 --> 00:20:43.198
Obviously. And yes.

450
00:20:43.372 --> 00:20:45.156
I want to speak
to you about this.

451
00:20:45.331 --> 00:20:47.115
This is your blog. is it not?

452
00:20:47.289 --> 00:20:49.291
The one you were trying
to pitch me the other day?

453
00:20:49.465 --> 00:20:50.553
I can explain.

454
00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:53.513
She's viral!

455
00:20:55.689 --> 00:20:57.734
My best friend!

456
00:20:58.866 --> 00:21:02.086
This blog is biting.
Witty. On trend.

457
00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:03.958
Very unlike you.

458
00:21:04.132 --> 00:21:06.134
I was actually trying
to take your advice. you know.

459
00:21:06.308 --> 00:21:08.005
be more personal in my writing.

460
00:21:08.179 --> 00:21:09.964
and I thought the blog
was a great exercise.

461
00:21:10.138 --> 00:21:11.357
And I know. technically.

462
00:21:11.531 --> 00:21:12.967
you know.
it's not allowed. but--

463
00:21:13.141 --> 00:21:15.709
It's brave and controversial.
I love it.

464
00:21:17.232 --> 00:21:19.190
You what?
I love it.

465
00:21:19.365 --> 00:21:21.976
So I'm not fired?
No! No. no. no.

466
00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:26.023
No. see. I want to take this
little anonymous blog of yours

467
00:21:26.197 --> 00:21:29.026
and turn it into a regular
column on Mush.

468
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.334
I want you to keep writing
content like this.

469
00:21:32.508 --> 00:21:34.380
Inga. really? Oh. yes!

470
00:21:34.554 --> 00:21:36.338
Oh. I have so many ideas.

471
00:21:36.512 --> 00:21:37.905
I mean. there's so many things
that I wanna write about--

472
00:21:38.079 --> 00:21:39.298
No. no. no. dear.
I'm sorry. You're not...

473
00:21:39.472 --> 00:21:40.995
You're not understanding.

474
00:21:41.169 --> 00:21:43.563
See. dating in the city.

475
00:21:43.737 --> 00:21:45.565
it's a jungle. okay?

476
00:21:45.739 --> 00:21:49.308
Women are struggling every day
to find real. lasting love.

477
00:21:50.439 --> 00:21:55.531
We should embrace
all your many. many flaws.

478
00:21:56.271 --> 00:21:58.404
That's what our site needs.

479
00:21:58.578 --> 00:22:01.015
Your date was cathartic.

480
00:22:01.189 --> 00:22:03.626
It was a beautiful revenge story

481
00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:06.586
set against every guy
in the city like The Player.

482
00:22:07.369 --> 00:22:08.936
A triumph from break-up column!

483
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:11.895
Uh. yeah. I'm actually
not following.

484
00:22:12.069 --> 00:22:14.289
You keep dating
this player character.

485
00:22:14.463 --> 00:22:16.422
Put him in more
uncomfortable situations.

486
00:22:16.596 --> 00:22:18.293
Write about it for the site

487
00:22:18.467 --> 00:22:20.948
and I will consider letting you
have your own column

488
00:22:21.122 --> 00:22:22.776
to write whatever you want.

489
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:25.996
Okay. so. so... you want me
to keep seeing Hol...

490
00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:28.956
The Player. and to write about
how much of a disaster he is.

491
00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:30.523
and then I get to write
whatever I want?

492
00:22:30.697 --> 00:22:33.003
Exactly.
And I'm doubling your pay.

493
00:22:33.177 --> 00:22:35.963
And promoting you from staff
writer to regular columnist.

494
00:22:36.137 --> 00:22:37.878
Congratulations.

495
00:22:38.052 --> 00:22:39.706
Uh. I mean. Inga.

496
00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.577
this is an incredible
opportunity. really. it is.

497
00:22:41.751 --> 00:22:44.319
I just don't think
it is possible.

498
00:22:44.493 --> 00:22:46.626
I mean. I can't even guarantee
that he'll agree to see me.

499
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:50.151
I mean. he hates me.
like. really. really hates me.

500
00:22:50.325 --> 00:22:53.067
Well. if you want a column
and creative control at Mush.

501
00:22:53.241 --> 00:22:55.156
make him un-hate you.

502
00:22:57.114 --> 00:22:58.464
Okay.

503
00:22:58.638 --> 00:23:00.248
But I have one condition.

504
00:23:02.468 --> 00:23:04.208
I'm listening.

505
00:23:04.774 --> 00:23:06.994
As long as you want me to
write about my personal life.

506
00:23:07.168 --> 00:23:08.474
I get to keep my anonymity.

507
00:23:08.648 --> 00:23:11.259
And I also get
to protect his identity.

508
00:23:11.433 --> 00:23:16.090
Being anonymous just helps me
be more honest in my writing.

509
00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:19.136
Surprisingly chic.

510
00:23:19.963 --> 00:23:21.008
Deal.

511
00:23:21.182 --> 00:23:22.879
Alright. so this column will run

512
00:23:23.053 --> 00:23:25.142
'till the end of the month
and then. you can pitch me

513
00:23:25.316 --> 00:23:26.535
whatever you want.

514
00:23:26.709 --> 00:23:28.624
Inga. why the end
of the month?

515
00:23:29.538 --> 00:23:31.105
Because then we'll be
switching over

516
00:23:31.279 --> 00:23:32.976
to juice cleanses and colonics.

517
00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:34.543
Winnie. come on. keep up.

518
00:23:34.717 --> 00:23:36.763
Oh. juice cleanses. yeah.
I can't wait!

519
00:23:38.329 --> 00:23:40.244
Thank you.

520
00:23:44.161 --> 00:23:45.554
What happened?

521
00:23:45.728 --> 00:23:48.905
Uh. well. she gave me
my own column.

522
00:23:49.079 --> 00:23:50.516
What? Are you kidding?

523
00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:52.039
That's amazing! Right?

524
00:23:52.213 --> 00:23:54.345
Why do you look
so disappointed?

525
00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.086
I... I'll tell you later.

526
00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:57.914
I just. I gotta go have
lunch with my mother.

527
00:23:58.088 --> 00:23:59.873
Oh. joy.

528
00:24:00.047 --> 00:24:01.178
Yeah. I'll...

529
00:24:01.352 --> 00:24:03.529
Say hi to Evette for me!
Oh. yeah.

530
00:24:03.703 --> 00:24:06.009
Love you. spinster daughter!

531
00:24:10.449 --> 00:24:12.407
You're slouching. dear!

532
00:24:12.581 --> 00:24:15.323
I don't understand
why you're always slouching.

533
00:24:16.498 --> 00:24:18.021
When are you gonna just take

534
00:24:18.195 --> 00:24:19.893
your trust fund already?

535
00:24:20.067 --> 00:24:22.548
This job is grinding you
to a fine powder.

536
00:24:22.722 --> 00:24:25.028
I want to make
my own money. okay?

537
00:24:25.202 --> 00:24:27.335
I have an apartment
that I pay for. I'm a writer.

538
00:24:27.509 --> 00:24:29.337
You know. we've been over this.

539
00:24:29.511 --> 00:24:31.948
You are a gossip columnist.

540
00:24:32.122 --> 00:24:34.560
It's hardly a real writer.

541
00:24:34.734 --> 00:24:36.562
Well. it's not gossip.
it's actually a lifestyle brand.

542
00:24:36.736 --> 00:24:38.564
it's a huge company. Mom.

543
00:24:38.738 --> 00:24:40.609
I just don't understand
why you insist

544
00:24:40.783 --> 00:24:44.526
on this bohemian
starving artist bit.

545
00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:46.963
I mean. this family
has worked hard

546
00:24:47.137 --> 00:24:49.923
to give you the means
to live a comfortable life.

547
00:24:50.097 --> 00:24:52.186
And you're throwing
it all away to write...

548
00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:55.058
What? I don't know.
what are you writing now?

549
00:24:56.146 --> 00:24:58.061
Well. I actually
just got my own column.

550
00:24:58.235 --> 00:24:59.933
Ah.
Yeah.

551
00:25:00.107 --> 00:25:01.891
About dating.

552
00:25:02.065 --> 00:25:03.502
Oh. how gauche.

553
00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.123
Nice cut. Dirk.

554
00:25:18.038 --> 00:25:19.953
I swear. it was like every woman
at the place was a vulture.

555
00:25:20.127 --> 00:25:21.432
and I was a piece
of fresh roadkill.

556
00:25:21.607 --> 00:25:24.131
But that Winnie stole my mojo.

557
00:25:25.611 --> 00:25:26.612
Ooh!

558
00:25:26.786 --> 00:25:29.353
That was a mean curveball.

559
00:25:29.528 --> 00:25:30.572
It was a bit outside.

560
00:25:30.746 --> 00:25:32.095
It's alright Dirk. keep it up!

561
00:25:35.229 --> 00:25:38.232
Come on. Jaybird.
you're weak today.

562
00:25:40.234 --> 00:25:41.583
Speak of the literal devil.

563
00:25:42.584 --> 00:25:43.933
Give it another shot.

564
00:25:44.107 --> 00:25:45.979
Why not?

565
00:25:46.153 --> 00:25:47.458
Why would I go on another date

566
00:25:47.633 --> 00:25:49.417
with a woman
who made it very clear

567
00:25:49.591 --> 00:25:53.421
she thinks I'm a walking cliché
of an unsettled man-child?

568
00:25:53.595 --> 00:25:56.946
To her credit.
she's not wrong.

569
00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.687
Yeah. she is.

570
00:25:58.861 --> 00:26:00.994
Right. really selling me
on this second date. Ret.

571
00:26:01.995 --> 00:26:03.474
You're so used to having women

572
00:26:03.649 --> 00:26:05.738
fall all over
themselves for you.

573
00:26:06.652 --> 00:26:09.045
Maybe it's time
that you spent some time

574
00:26:09.219 --> 00:26:11.961
with a woman that doesn't find
your overconfidence.

575
00:26:12.135 --> 00:26:13.963
your London accent.

576
00:26:14.137 --> 00:26:17.445
and your annoying good hairline
so charming.

577
00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:20.187
Call me at six.

578
00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.198
This guy's got an arm.

579
00:26:32.199 --> 00:26:35.028
Okay. One more date.

580
00:26:35.202 --> 00:26:36.420
For Perkins.

581
00:26:40.642 --> 00:26:43.950
I can't believe he agreed
to another date.

582
00:26:44.124 --> 00:26:46.996
Yeah. it's like he was
actually eager to see me.

583
00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:49.042
But luckily. you know. I
had a little bit of time

584
00:26:49.216 --> 00:26:51.044
to plan something.
Ooh!

585
00:26:51.218 --> 00:26:53.437
Yeah. you know. just something
to speed along the material.

586
00:26:53.612 --> 00:26:55.222
make Inga happy.

587
00:26:55.396 --> 00:26:58.007
Mm. well that's the only thing
that's important.

588
00:26:58.181 --> 00:27:00.140
making Inga happy.
Mm-hmm!

589
00:27:00.314 --> 00:27:01.881
Have fun!
Thank you.

590
00:27:02.055 --> 00:27:03.491
See you later.

591
00:27:04.535 --> 00:27:06.842
Alright. I am off.

592
00:27:07.016 --> 00:27:08.583
second date with serious girl.

593
00:27:08.757 --> 00:27:10.541
I ordered you pizza.
Cool.

594
00:27:10.716 --> 00:27:12.369
You know. if I keep this up.

595
00:27:12.543 --> 00:27:14.458
I might actually get
a serious girlfriend.

596
00:27:15.546 --> 00:27:16.896
Whoa. Ty. come on mate.

597
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:19.072
I'm joking.
That's not funny.

598
00:27:19.246 --> 00:27:20.987
So what's going on
with that girl you like?

599
00:27:21.161 --> 00:27:22.902
Did you ask her
to the dance yet?

600
00:27:23.076 --> 00:27:25.339
Uh... not exactly.

601
00:27:25.513 --> 00:27:27.602
Come on. You gotta put
yourself out there.

602
00:27:27.776 --> 00:27:29.082
Well. that's easy
for you to say.

603
00:27:29.256 --> 00:27:31.084
Okay Ty. listen.
Women are easy.

604
00:27:31.258 --> 00:27:32.912
Just tell her
that you like her.

605
00:27:33.086 --> 00:27:34.653
Dad. no offence.

606
00:27:34.827 --> 00:27:37.264
but I just don't think
it's a good idea for me

607
00:27:37.438 --> 00:27:40.267
to be taking advice from a guy
who got a drink thrown at him

608
00:27:40.441 --> 00:27:42.051
less than 24 hours ago

609
00:27:42.225 --> 00:27:45.011
and is now going
on a second date with a girl

610
00:27:45.185 --> 00:27:47.927
he doesn't even like
because his boss told him to.

611
00:27:48.101 --> 00:27:50.146
Harsh but fair.

612
00:27:51.147 --> 00:27:53.367
Pizza will be here in 20.
Cash is on the counter.

613
00:27:53.541 --> 00:27:54.542
I'll be back in a bit.

614
00:27:54.716 --> 00:27:56.762
Cool. Later.

615
00:28:03.464 --> 00:28:04.857
Hi.

616
00:28:05.031 --> 00:28:06.510
Hi.

617
00:28:08.121 --> 00:28:10.297
I. uh. wanted to apologize.

618
00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:13.256
I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

619
00:28:14.301 --> 00:28:17.957
It's okay. I shouldn't have
called you a lothario.

620
00:28:19.045 --> 00:28:21.047
Truce?

621
00:28:21.612 --> 00:28:23.179
Truce.

622
00:28:23.658 --> 00:28:26.182
So. what exactly are we doing?

623
00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:28.402
I've got something in mind.

624
00:28:29.446 --> 00:28:31.057
Like?

625
00:28:35.104 --> 00:28:36.149
Jazz night again.

626
00:28:36.323 --> 00:28:37.498
I thought we already did this?

627
00:28:37.672 --> 00:28:41.284
Well. kind of.
Here he is. Hey!

628
00:28:41.458 --> 00:28:43.330
You ready?

629
00:28:43.504 --> 00:28:45.071
Uh. what's going on?

630
00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.119
Hello. hello!
Ladies and gentlemen.

631
00:28:50.293 --> 00:28:54.123
ah. do we have
a treat for you tonight.

632
00:28:54.297 --> 00:28:56.169
Welcome to the stage.

633
00:28:56.343 --> 00:28:58.475
the one. the only.

634
00:28:58.649 --> 00:29:00.913
Holden Fulls.

635
00:29:01.087 --> 00:29:02.436
Woo!

636
00:29:05.656 --> 00:29:07.963
You want me to sing in public?
Yeah.

637
00:29:08.137 --> 00:29:09.878
Have you ever heard two cats
fighting in an alleyway?

638
00:29:10.052 --> 00:29:12.838
That's me singing!
Relax! It will be fun!

639
00:29:13.012 --> 00:29:14.840
I... I don't do music.

640
00:29:15.014 --> 00:29:16.972
Well. you do now.
Okay. have fun.

641
00:29:17.146 --> 00:29:19.018
Okay...
Woo! Holden. everyone!

642
00:29:19.192 --> 00:29:21.934
Uh. I... I... What song?

643
00:29:22.108 --> 00:29:24.023
What song?
It had to be you.

644
00:29:24.197 --> 00:29:26.112
You can just do a scat improv.
You'll be great.

645
00:29:26.286 --> 00:29:29.637
Uh. great. Okay.

646
00:29:30.246 --> 00:29:33.032
I don't know any...
I don't know any...

647
00:29:33.206 --> 00:29:37.036
It had to be you...

648
00:29:38.211 --> 00:29:41.083
It had to be you...

649
00:29:42.389 --> 00:29:46.219
Skee-ba-ba-boo.

650
00:29:46.393 --> 00:29:48.525
Skeedle-bae!

651
00:29:48.699 --> 00:29:50.876
Haba! Haba!

652
00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:54.880
Haba! Skee-da-da-dee-ah!

653
00:29:55.054 --> 00:29:56.795
Skee-sko-badoo...

654
00:29:59.493 --> 00:30:02.365
Skee-skada-bow!

655
00:30:06.065 --> 00:30:08.328
Love! Yeah!

656
00:30:08.502 --> 00:30:14.160
It had to be you!

657
00:30:14.334 --> 00:30:15.596
Skee--

658
00:30:17.206 --> 00:30:18.860
Yeah. cheers.

659
00:30:19.034 --> 00:30:20.731
[Winnie]: Woo!

660
00:30:24.344 --> 00:30:26.346
Well. that was
deeply scarring.

661
00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.957
And not just for you.

662
00:30:29.131 --> 00:30:30.916
Well. cheers to being
traumatized

663
00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:33.266
and never singing jazz again.
Oh. I can't cheers to that.

664
00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:35.485
Cheers to me never
singing jazz again.

665
00:30:38.793 --> 00:30:42.318
Are there any other activities
that I should be aware of?

666
00:30:43.145 --> 00:30:44.973
Well. uh...
I actually volunteer

667
00:30:45.147 --> 00:30:46.932
at the community centre
by my place.

668
00:30:47.106 --> 00:30:48.455
Plan after-school activities.

669
00:30:48.629 --> 00:30:51.284
and I mentor kids
and stuff like that.

670
00:30:51.458 --> 00:30:52.589
So. you like kids?

671
00:30:52.763 --> 00:30:55.201
I love kids. Yeah.

672
00:30:56.115 --> 00:30:57.551
Good to know.

673
00:30:58.595 --> 00:31:00.249
Hey. um...

674
00:31:00.423 --> 00:31:02.948
why was that woman
so mad at you the other night?

675
00:31:03.122 --> 00:31:06.125
I suppose she thinks
I. uh. mislead her.

676
00:31:06.299 --> 00:31:07.822
About what?

677
00:31:07.996 --> 00:31:09.519
A part of my life.

678
00:31:09.693 --> 00:31:11.521
What part?

679
00:31:13.306 --> 00:31:15.090
You know. if we're gonna
keep doing this.

680
00:31:15.264 --> 00:31:17.484
I think it should happen
organically.

681
00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:21.488
You know. some things
take a bit of time.

682
00:31:21.662 --> 00:31:24.317
Okay. Fair enough.

683
00:31:33.152 --> 00:31:35.458
Well. this is me. so...

684
00:31:36.198 --> 00:31:37.286
Do you...?

685
00:31:39.506 --> 00:31:41.029
Shall we?

686
00:31:43.118 --> 00:31:44.990
Good night.
Right. Yeah.

687
00:31:45.164 --> 00:31:47.383
Yeah. Good night.

688
00:31:50.821 --> 00:31:53.041
Handshake.

689
00:31:53.215 --> 00:31:55.304
At this rate. I'll never
get to the gala.

690
00:31:56.392 --> 00:31:59.874
Tell me. how did I end up
with a trashy dating column

691
00:32:00.048 --> 00:32:03.138
when all I've ever wanted
was to be Harper Lee!

692
00:32:03.312 --> 00:32:08.013
Winnie. Just do this one job

693
00:32:08.187 --> 00:32:12.104
and then you can write
anything you want.

694
00:32:12.582 --> 00:32:14.889
Yeah. I just don't know
if I can keep dating this guy

695
00:32:15.063 --> 00:32:18.197
because he's awful. Kyra!
He's awful.

696
00:32:18.371 --> 00:32:21.200
So you use it. Channel it.

697
00:32:21.374 --> 00:32:22.853
I will use it.
Use it.

698
00:32:23.028 --> 00:32:25.204
I will channel it.
Yes!

699
00:32:25.378 --> 00:32:27.902
And then write about it.
Yeah. Okay.

700
00:32:28.076 --> 00:32:29.295
That's it.
I can do this.

701
00:32:29.469 --> 00:32:31.166
What would you do without me?

702
00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:33.125
Okay. Here goes nothing.

703
00:32:36.345 --> 00:32:37.956
If you need me
I'll be right here. okay?

704
00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:40.306
Okay.
Okay.

705
00:32:51.404 --> 00:32:53.232

00:32:53.406 --> 00:32:55.147
Yes bestie!

707
00:32:55.321 --> 00:32:56.931
That is what I'm talking about.

708
00:32:57.105 --> 00:32:58.889
High-five.
Yes!

709
00:32:59.064 --> 00:33:00.456
Oh. that's so good!

710
00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:02.502
Hey.
Mm-hmm.

711
00:33:02.676 --> 00:33:05.940
Do you think I should tell
Inga that I put...

712
00:33:06.114 --> 00:33:09.422
regular flour in those brownies?

713
00:33:11.032 --> 00:33:14.035
Stop!

714
00:33:18.083 --> 00:33:19.040
Mm!

715
00:33:20.694 --> 00:33:22.261
Absolutely not.

716
00:33:23.218 --> 00:33:25.003
Yes. yes. yes. Kyra!

717
00:33:25.177 --> 00:33:26.874
Yes to this!

718
00:33:27.048 --> 00:33:28.180
Mm.

719
00:33:31.139 --> 00:33:34.969
I need to know that I'm gonna
get the best sneaker contracts.

720
00:33:35.143 --> 00:33:38.233
sodas. watches. billboards.

721
00:33:39.234 --> 00:33:41.584
Your number one priority
is playing ball.

722
00:33:41.758 --> 00:33:43.630
You're talented.

723
00:33:43.804 --> 00:33:45.980
But you're an inch away
from screwing it all up

724
00:33:46.154 --> 00:33:48.417
with that mouth of yours.
What Ret means to say

725
00:33:48.591 --> 00:33:50.898
is that if you do your job
out on the field.

726
00:33:51.072 --> 00:33:52.639
I can make sure
all the big brands

727
00:33:52.813 --> 00:33:55.033
are gonna be begging
to work with you.

728
00:33:55.207 --> 00:33:57.948
Eric Potsworth says
he can get the job done. so.

729
00:33:58.123 --> 00:33:59.298
how do I know
you'll do it better?

730
00:33:59.472 --> 00:34:00.908
Hold off on making a decision

731
00:34:01.082 --> 00:34:03.258
until after the Insiders Gala.

732
00:34:03.432 --> 00:34:05.173
All the top CEOs
are gonna be there.

733
00:34:05.347 --> 00:34:07.306
and they're always
in the mood to do business.

734
00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.482
I mean. Eric Potsworth's
a dime a dozen

735
00:34:09.656 --> 00:34:13.007
and his agency's a veritable
meat grinder.

736
00:34:13.181 --> 00:34:15.401
You need an agency that actually
cares about you.

737
00:34:24.192 --> 00:34:27.195
I guarantee I can secure you
a big brand contract

738
00:34:27.369 --> 00:34:29.806
at the gala.
right then and there.

739
00:34:30.981 --> 00:34:32.461
Hm.

740
00:34:33.636 --> 00:34:36.117
Deal. I'll decide at the gala.

741
00:34:42.297 --> 00:34:44.865
Ah. Jada. um. hey.

742
00:34:45.039 --> 00:34:47.085
there's this. uh.
there's this dance.

743
00:34:48.173 --> 00:34:51.132
Jada. What's up? It's... Ty.

744
00:34:53.439 --> 00:34:55.484
[Winnie]: Hey. ladies.

745
00:34:55.658 --> 00:34:58.052
Hey. Jada. um. don't look now.

746
00:34:58.226 --> 00:35:00.098
but I think that boy
might have a crush on you.

747
00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:03.623
And interest in asking him
to join us today?

748
00:35:05.451 --> 00:35:07.496
Hey! Over here!

749
00:35:08.193 --> 00:35:10.020
Yes. you. Come here.

750
00:35:13.502 --> 00:35:14.938
I run the after-school
activities here

751
00:35:15.113 --> 00:35:16.897
and we're actually playing
basketball today.

752
00:35:17.071 --> 00:35:19.117
any interest in joining us?

753
00:35:19.291 --> 00:35:22.076
Uh. yeah. Sure.

754
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:25.035
Oh. great. I'm Winnie.
Ty.

755
00:35:26.559 --> 00:35:28.343
You know. Ty.
when you like someone.

756
00:35:28.517 --> 00:35:31.390
it's probably a good idea
to talk to them.

757
00:35:31.564 --> 00:35:33.740
What? I... I don't like...

758
00:35:35.002 --> 00:35:37.091
Tell that to your face.

759
00:35:37.744 --> 00:35:40.921
Look. Jada's like. next level.

760
00:35:41.095 --> 00:35:42.401
There's no chance
she likes me back.

761
00:35:42.575 --> 00:35:44.142
Mm. I wouldn't be so sure.

762
00:35:44.316 --> 00:35:46.405
Really?
All I'm gonna say

763
00:35:46.579 --> 00:35:49.059
is that she's actually mentioned
a boy named Ty before.

764
00:35:49.234 --> 00:35:52.062
so unless there's tons of Tys
running around your school.

765
00:35:52.237 --> 00:35:53.586
I'm guessing she meant you.

766
00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.936
Just ask her.
How?

767
00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:58.068
Be honest.
Put yourself out there.

768
00:35:58.243 --> 00:36:00.158
You got this. Ask her.

769
00:36:01.071 --> 00:36:02.247
Thanks. Winnie.

770
00:36:06.381 --> 00:36:08.601
I mean. what was that
about Ret?

771
00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.734
He's a chump. Holden.

772
00:36:11.908 --> 00:36:14.128
Now. I've been in this business
for over 40 years.

773
00:36:14.302 --> 00:36:15.912
and I think I know
a thing or two

774
00:36:16.086 --> 00:36:17.218
about what players
are gonna last.

775
00:36:17.392 --> 00:36:19.089
Who said anything
about lasting?

776
00:36:19.264 --> 00:36:21.962
When I started this company.
you know what I wanted?

777
00:36:22.136 --> 00:36:23.616
A billion-dollar valuation?

778
00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:26.053
No. I wanted hall-of-famers.

779
00:36:26.227 --> 00:36:28.229
Players that gave everything
for the game.

780
00:36:28.403 --> 00:36:31.580
Some players are just
money players. Ret.

781
00:36:31.754 --> 00:36:34.366
You came to me knowing
zilch about baseball.

782
00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:36.455
All that cricket and polo

783
00:36:36.629 --> 00:36:38.587
and whatever else
you Brits like.

784
00:36:38.761 --> 00:36:40.154
You were hungry.

785
00:36:41.286 --> 00:36:42.504
And you wanted more.

786
00:36:43.462 --> 00:36:45.246
Remember what I said to you?

787
00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:47.466
"You don't have to swing hard
to hit a home run.

788
00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:50.251
If you've got the timing.
it'll go."

789
00:36:50.425 --> 00:36:53.298
That's right. Yogi Berra.

790
00:36:53.472 --> 00:36:54.995
Yogi Berra.
Why don't you dig down deep

791
00:36:55.169 --> 00:36:56.997
for me and find that kid again?

792
00:36:57.171 --> 00:36:59.391
'Cause that money-grabbin'.

793
00:36:59.565 --> 00:37:02.045
fast-talking fool
ain't my thing.

794
00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:05.745
And it sure isn't the way I want
my company run after I'm gone.

795
00:37:07.137 --> 00:37:08.574
Well. you'll see.

796
00:37:08.748 --> 00:37:10.228
After the gala.

797
00:37:12.142 --> 00:37:13.274
Hey.

798
00:37:15.015 --> 00:37:17.104
Quit swinging so hard. kid.

799
00:37:38.212 --> 00:37:41.128
Hey!
How are you?

800
00:37:41.694 --> 00:37:43.870
Arts and crafts.
Yup.

801
00:37:44.044 --> 00:37:45.524
Starting to think
you enjoy torturing me.

802
00:37:45.698 --> 00:37:47.961
Painting is relaxing.

803
00:37:48.135 --> 00:37:50.268
Really?
Oh. yeah.

804
00:37:52.444 --> 00:37:54.184
Paint brush.
Right.

805
00:37:54.359 --> 00:37:55.969
Cheers.
Oh.

806
00:37:56.143 --> 00:37:58.406
Okay. Easy.
Sorry.

807
00:38:05.544 --> 00:38:07.415
[Winnie]: It looks like
you're enjoying it.

808
00:38:07.589 --> 00:38:10.026
Don't... don't break
the artist streak here.

809
00:38:11.114 --> 00:38:12.551
Kind of therapeutic. no?

810
00:38:12.725 --> 00:38:14.944
I'm so Zen.
Yeah. me too.

811
00:38:15.118 --> 00:38:18.208
I'm like a koi pond.

812
00:38:18.383 --> 00:38:21.429
I'm like a cloud doing yoga.

813
00:38:21.603 --> 00:38:24.171
You know. you're kind of
killing my Zen right now.

814
00:38:27.653 --> 00:38:30.177
Okay.
Okay.

815
00:38:33.049 --> 00:38:34.050
Who is that supposed to be?

816
00:38:34.224 --> 00:38:36.444
It's me. Kind of.

817
00:38:36.618 --> 00:38:39.404
Okay. well. from this angle.
it actually kind of looks like

818
00:38:39.578 --> 00:38:42.102
a very colourful
Winston Churchill.

819
00:38:43.625 --> 00:38:46.062
Oh. bollocks.
That's it. I'm done.

820
00:38:46.759 --> 00:38:48.282
I've had enough.

821
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:51.285
You really do a lot
for this place. don't you?

822
00:38:51.459 --> 00:38:54.027
These kids are important?
Oh yeah. Yeah.

823
00:38:54.201 --> 00:38:56.508
This year I'm actually
giving them all art supplies.

824
00:38:56.682 --> 00:38:58.205
Oh. how many?

825
00:38:58.379 --> 00:39:01.817
There is 218 this year.
something like that.

826
00:39:01.991 --> 00:39:04.037
You're gonna give
218 kids art supplies?

827
00:39:04.211 --> 00:39:05.560
Well. sort of.

828
00:39:05.734 --> 00:39:07.780
Oh. what.
you're a trust fund baby?

829
00:39:07.954 --> 00:39:09.347
Well. I don't use it.

830
00:39:09.521 --> 00:39:12.306
so I put it back
into the community centre.

831
00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:15.091
Are you telling me
you've got a trust fund?

832
00:39:15.265 --> 00:39:16.963
Look. I don't need
all that money.

833
00:39:17.137 --> 00:39:18.965
and I would rather
have it go to them.

834
00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:27.800
You know. this place actually
reminds me of my childhood.

835
00:39:27.974 --> 00:39:29.845
Oh. you used to volunteer too?

836
00:39:30.019 --> 00:39:33.327
Uh. no. more like I was
the one being volunteered for.

837
00:39:33.501 --> 00:39:35.982
There was this woman.
a lot like you. actually.

838
00:39:36.156 --> 00:39:38.288
who used to drop off gifts
at the leisure centre.

839
00:39:39.115 --> 00:39:40.682
The only gifts I ever got.

840
00:39:43.119 --> 00:39:46.166
Oh. I... I didn't realize.

841
00:39:47.646 --> 00:39:51.519
Well. most women as beautiful
as you are not as giving.

842
00:39:55.567 --> 00:39:57.307
I should probably. um...

843
00:39:58.134 --> 00:39:59.309
I should go.
Yeah.

844
00:39:59.484 --> 00:40:01.399
Okay.

845
00:40:04.097 --> 00:40:05.794
Hey!

846
00:40:05.968 --> 00:40:08.188
You almost knocked over
the former prime minister!

847
00:40:09.145 --> 00:40:11.583
Poor Winston.

848
00:40:15.151 --> 00:40:16.762
How are you?

849
00:40:18.764 --> 00:40:20.287
Ignore this.

850
00:40:21.201 --> 00:40:23.159
You're home late.

851
00:40:23.333 --> 00:40:25.814
Yeah. I actually had a...
a nice time.

852
00:40:25.988 --> 00:40:27.555
Cool.

853
00:40:29.165 --> 00:40:30.602
So. do you. uh.

854
00:40:30.776 --> 00:40:32.647
do you actually
like this girl or...?

855
00:40:32.821 --> 00:40:35.128
Yeah. I kind of do.

856
00:40:35.302 --> 00:40:37.565
Well. am I gonna get
to meet her or...

857
00:40:37.739 --> 00:40:40.002
at least get to know
anything about her?

858
00:40:40.176 --> 00:40:43.484
Well. um.
when I'm ready. yeah.

859
00:40:43.658 --> 00:40:45.443
Can you at least
just tell me what she's like?

860
00:40:45.617 --> 00:40:49.142
She's um... generous and kind.

861
00:40:49.316 --> 00:40:51.318
And surprising.

862
00:40:53.233 --> 00:40:56.018
Look. I wanna make sure
that if and when you meet her

863
00:40:56.192 --> 00:40:57.629
that she's gonna be someone
that's gonna be around

864
00:40:57.803 --> 00:40:59.674
for a long time.

865
00:40:59.848 --> 00:41:02.111
Yeah. I get it.

866
00:41:02.285 --> 00:41:04.331
It's just. you know.

867
00:41:04.505 --> 00:41:06.246
two musketeers.

868
00:41:07.726 --> 00:41:09.423
Right.

869
00:41:10.729 --> 00:41:12.295
Always.

870
00:41:13.427 --> 00:41:15.995
You know you're the best. right?

871
00:41:16.169 --> 00:41:17.866
You know that?

872
00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.521
So. uh. what's your next date?

873
00:41:20.695 --> 00:41:23.916
Well. I think it's gonna be
an urban scavenger hunt.

874
00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:25.570
Apparently there's all these
cool things

875
00:41:25.744 --> 00:41:27.049
hidden all over the city
and I've got this site

876
00:41:27.223 --> 00:41:28.398
that leads us to all
the cool spots.

877
00:41:28.573 --> 00:41:30.923
Sounds fun.
Yeah.

878
00:41:31.097 --> 00:41:32.925
I'm gonna get some sleep.

879
00:41:33.099 --> 00:41:35.231
Good night.
Good night.

880
00:41:46.547 --> 00:41:48.244
Scavenger hunt.

881
00:41:55.295 --> 00:41:57.732
Here.
Oh. yeah. Cheers.

882
00:42:01.475 --> 00:42:03.477
Thanks. mate.
Have fun!

883
00:42:05.087 --> 00:42:06.393
Hey.
Hi.

884
00:42:08.482 --> 00:42:11.833
Uh. eat some candy
or something?

885
00:42:12.007 --> 00:42:14.357
Uh. no.
No. why do you ask?

886
00:42:14.532 --> 00:42:15.924
Mm...
Why?

887
00:42:16.098 --> 00:42:17.970
No reason.

888
00:42:18.144 --> 00:42:20.538
Okay. You're being weird.

889
00:42:21.321 --> 00:42:23.932
Glad the red dye was washable.

890
00:42:24.106 --> 00:42:25.586
Yeah. Me too.

891
00:42:26.674 --> 00:42:28.850
Says we're supposed to go
to Harold Washington Library

892
00:42:29.024 --> 00:42:30.983
but... this can't be right.

893
00:42:31.157 --> 00:42:32.462
Getting directions

894
00:42:32.637 --> 00:42:34.029
to previous destination.

895
00:42:34.203 --> 00:42:35.944
Hair Restore Hair Plug Doctors.

896
00:42:36.118 --> 00:42:37.555
Uh...

897
00:42:37.729 --> 00:42:39.600
Okay. so. I don't know
what that's about.

898
00:42:39.774 --> 00:42:41.646
Would you like me to direct
you to Toupees and Beyond.

899
00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:43.648
Doctor Coiffure.
Balding Specialists?

900
00:42:43.822 --> 00:42:46.999
No! I mean obviously.
I've got a full head of hair.

901
00:42:47.173 --> 00:42:49.044
Yeah. it's a really
believable toupee.

902
00:42:49.218 --> 00:42:50.742
It's not a toupee!
Mm. Yeah.

903
00:42:50.916 --> 00:42:53.048
No. it's real. Touch it.
Directing to Big Ricks

904
00:42:53.222 --> 00:42:53.962
Wig World.

905
00:42:54.136 --> 00:42:55.485
Gah!

906
00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:57.662
It must be some sort of bug.

907
00:42:59.141 --> 00:43:00.926
Well. apparently
our urban scavenger hunt

908
00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:04.059
has turned into a slow walking
tour of the city.

909
00:43:04.233 --> 00:43:05.974
Yeah. but at least
I'm learning a lot

910
00:43:06.148 --> 00:43:07.846
about hair-restoration
technique. so there's that.

911
00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:10.196
Oh. are you? Okay.

912
00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:14.504
Okay. well. follow me.
This way.

913
00:43:14.679 --> 00:43:16.158
Now. if you see...

914
00:43:17.159 --> 00:43:19.988
this house right here.
when I was younger.

915
00:43:20.162 --> 00:43:21.424
my friends and I
used to doorbell ditch

916
00:43:21.599 --> 00:43:23.296
houses just like that.

917
00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:27.082
I dare you to do it again.

918
00:43:27.648 --> 00:43:30.346
Okay. Only if you
do it with me.

919
00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:32.218
What? No. No. no. no.

920
00:43:32.392 --> 00:43:34.568
Oh. oh. no.
but are you a chicken?

921
00:43:34.742 --> 00:43:36.526
No! No. I just--
Are you a chicken?

922
00:43:36.701 --> 00:43:39.399
She's a chicken.

923
00:43:42.445 --> 00:43:44.143
Okay. Okay. Go!

924
00:43:58.331 --> 00:43:59.811
What are you--

925
00:43:59.985 --> 00:44:01.508
Oh. my. she's coming!

926
00:44:07.601 --> 00:44:09.255
My heart's gonna beat
out of my chest.

927
00:44:09.429 --> 00:44:11.605
I forgot how fun that was.

928
00:44:26.794 --> 00:44:30.493
Sierra. It's Inga.
We should talk.

929
00:44:32.104 --> 00:44:34.019
A 100-mile-per-hour fastball.

930
00:44:34.193 --> 00:44:35.934
That's impressive.

931
00:44:36.108 --> 00:44:38.023
You ever think about
playing pro?

932
00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:42.462
Take my card.

933
00:44:42.636 --> 00:44:44.333
I think you've got
something special.

934
00:44:48.076 --> 00:44:49.861
You know. one thing
I'll never understand

935
00:44:50.035 --> 00:44:53.995
about you Americans is how much
you love standing in line.

936
00:44:54.169 --> 00:44:56.606
There's actually a ramen place
in Wicker Park

937
00:44:56.781 --> 00:44:59.392
that has the best
ramen ever. obviously.

938
00:44:59.566 --> 00:45:01.873
and people actually camp outside
the night before.

939
00:45:02.047 --> 00:45:03.222
Camp?
Mm-hmm.

940
00:45:03.396 --> 00:45:04.919
We should go there next time.

941
00:45:05.093 --> 00:45:07.095
Literally the night before.
It's that good.

942
00:45:07.269 --> 00:45:09.054
Can I ask you something?

943
00:45:09.228 --> 00:45:10.272
- Shoot.

944
00:45:10.446 --> 00:45:12.231
- How are you still single?

945
00:45:12.405 --> 00:45:13.362
- Honestly?

946
00:45:14.407 --> 00:45:16.888
Well. my dates are
usually disasters.

947
00:45:17.062 --> 00:45:20.500
- Oh good. I thought it was
me that was the disaster.

948
00:45:20.674 --> 00:45:23.982
- Oh. you are.
Trust me. But so am I.

949
00:45:26.114 --> 00:45:27.115
[soft music]

950
00:45:27.289 --> 00:45:30.075
- Uh. you've got a little...

951
00:45:31.293 --> 00:45:32.512
- Oh.
[chuckling]

952
00:45:38.648 --> 00:45:39.649
[phone chiming]

953
00:45:42.435 --> 00:45:44.742
- Sorry. uh...
- Don't answer it.

954
00:45:47.614 --> 00:45:50.095
- Sorry. I. uh... one sec.

955
00:45:51.661 --> 00:45:54.055
I gotta go.
I spaced on a deadline.

956
00:45:54.229 --> 00:45:56.231
- I thought you wanted
to be a novelist.

957
00:45:56.797 --> 00:45:59.191
I mean. your boss sounds awful.

958
00:45:59.365 --> 00:46:00.801
And she's clearly addicted
to her phone.

959
00:46:00.975 --> 00:46:02.847
Just... Why not just quit?

960
00:46:03.021 --> 00:46:04.892
- It's not that simple.
Okay? I gotta go.

961
00:46:05.066 --> 00:46:07.155
- But... Okay.
Winnie. I didn't...

962
00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:09.592
[door closing]

963
00:46:11.029 --> 00:46:12.117
Great.

964
00:46:21.691 --> 00:46:23.084
[sighs]

965
00:46:24.564 --> 00:46:25.652
- What am I doing?

966
00:46:26.522 --> 00:46:27.349
[footsteps approaching]

967
00:46:28.655 --> 00:46:31.049
- Hey. hey. hey!
I made lasagna. You want some?

968
00:46:31.658 --> 00:46:33.486
- No. I'm good.

969
00:46:35.009 --> 00:46:35.662
- You okay?

970
00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:42.408
- We almost kissed.

971
00:46:44.018 --> 00:46:45.324
- You and Player?

972
00:46:47.021 --> 00:46:49.545
Ew. Why? What? When? Where? How?

973
00:46:49.719 --> 00:46:52.461
- It's like I'm actually
starting to actually like him.

974
00:46:52.635 --> 00:46:56.204
How am I supposed to write
a break-up post at the end
of this thing when...

975
00:46:56.378 --> 00:47:00.121
If I'm actually starting
to have feelings for the guy?

976
00:47:01.122 --> 00:47:02.950
- You need to tell Holden
the truth.

977
00:47:03.124 --> 00:47:05.910
- What? No. I can't.
He'll hate me.

978
00:47:06.084 --> 00:47:07.563
- It's going to come out
eventually. Win.

979
00:47:07.737 --> 00:47:10.958
Women all over the city
are reading your column.

980
00:47:11.132 --> 00:47:14.005
- I know... it's bad!
Ugh. it's bad!

981
00:47:14.179 --> 00:47:15.484
- Are you crazy?

982
00:47:15.658 --> 00:47:17.051
This is what you've
always wanted.

983
00:47:17.225 --> 00:47:19.532
Your writing is finally
getting noticed!

984
00:47:21.186 --> 00:47:25.233
Stop "Holden" back the truth.
See what I did there?

985
00:47:25.407 --> 00:47:28.106
- Yeah.
- Tell him.

986
00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:30.891
If he really likes you.
he'll understand.

987
00:47:31.065 --> 00:47:32.545
[bright music]

988
00:47:48.996 --> 00:47:50.171
- Something to ruin the mood.

989
00:47:52.217 --> 00:47:53.174
[chuckling]

990
00:47:56.134 --> 00:47:57.700
- Toast?
- Thanks.

991
00:47:58.353 --> 00:48:01.139
I'm going to stay at Brody's
after practice if that's cool.

992
00:48:01.313 --> 00:48:04.185
- Uh. sure. yeah.
That's fine by me.

993
00:48:04.359 --> 00:48:05.578
- Sweet. Okay.

994
00:48:05.752 --> 00:48:07.754
- Have fun.
- I will. See ya!

995
00:48:21.159 --> 00:48:24.292
- Sorry. Ty.
In case she comes over.

996
00:48:24.466 --> 00:48:26.599
[humming]

997
00:48:33.998 --> 00:48:35.173
[phone chiming]

998
00:48:37.001 --> 00:48:37.784
- Hey.

999
00:48:37.958 --> 00:48:39.264
[Holden]: Hi.

1000
00:48:39.438 --> 00:48:40.526
So. you've shown
me your world.

1001
00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:42.354
How about today.
I show you mine?

1002
00:48:42.528 --> 00:48:44.138
- Okay. what did you have
in mind?

1003
00:48:47.402 --> 00:48:50.188
- Oh. look at you.
So cute in your little helmet.

1004
00:48:50.362 --> 00:48:51.667
- What did I do to deserve this?

1005
00:48:51.841 --> 00:48:53.104
- Hey. I sang and did
art for you.

1006
00:48:53.278 --> 00:48:54.409
Two of my least
favourite things.

1007
00:48:55.323 --> 00:48:59.153
Indulge me in a little payback.
- Fine.

1008
00:48:59.327 --> 00:49:01.199
- I'm just gonna widen this out.

1009
00:49:03.201 --> 00:49:06.944
Now. this is kind of obligatory.
- Okay.

1010
00:49:07.118 --> 00:49:11.252
- Now... Baseball is all
about grace.

1011
00:49:13.037 --> 00:49:14.081
Yeah!

1012
00:49:14.255 --> 00:49:15.865
A little more grace than that.

1013
00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:18.520
Grace and...
- Okay...

1014
00:49:18.694 --> 00:49:19.739
- Efficiency.

1015
00:49:21.132 --> 00:49:23.438
Never... take your eye
off the ball.

1016
00:49:24.396 --> 00:49:25.875
- Okay.
- You ready?

1017
00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:27.660
- Not at all.

1018
00:49:29.227 --> 00:49:30.576
Ugh!

1019
00:49:32.056 --> 00:49:33.318
Oh. I'm terrible at this!

1020
00:49:33.492 --> 00:49:34.536
- You're closing your eyes!

1021
00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:38.062
Remember what I said. always
keep your eye on what you want.

1022
00:49:43.676 --> 00:49:45.939
Whoa!
- Woo!

1023
00:49:46.113 --> 00:49:49.421
- There it goes.
we got a ringer.
ladies and gentlemen!

1024
00:49:49.595 --> 00:49:50.596
[laughing. cheering]

1025
00:49:51.205 --> 00:49:54.034
Miss Winnie Rhodes!

1026
00:49:56.123 --> 00:49:57.733
You gotta run. you gotta run!
- I gotta run!

1027
00:49:57.907 --> 00:50:02.086
- Come on! They're signalling!
She's running home!

1028
00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:04.131
She's going for it!
Don't slide!

1029
00:50:04.305 --> 00:50:08.440
- I don't even need to rush.
- Safe! Amazing.

1030
00:50:09.441 --> 00:50:10.790
[chuckling]

1031
00:50:10.964 --> 00:50:12.618
- So. why baseball?
- Why baseball?

1032
00:50:12.792 --> 00:50:14.924
- Mm-hmm!
- Why baseball?

1033
00:50:15.099 --> 00:50:16.578
- Of all sports. why baseball?

1034
00:50:16.752 --> 00:50:17.579
- Baseball is the most
American sport there is.

1035
00:50:17.753 --> 00:50:19.103
- Um...

1036
00:50:19.277 --> 00:50:21.235
- Um... Okay. when I left
England.

1037
00:50:21.409 --> 00:50:23.629
I left with nothing.
I had no money. no family.

1038
00:50:23.803 --> 00:50:25.413
America was this fresh start.

1039
00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:30.462
And apple pie and baseball
were my first American loves.

1040
00:50:30.636 --> 00:50:33.508
And they are dear to me
to this day. Sorry.

1041
00:50:33.682 --> 00:50:37.643
- Ugh. you're so lucky.
you know? To have
a career where...

1042
00:50:37.817 --> 00:50:39.036
you get to do what you love.

1043
00:50:39.210 --> 00:50:40.950
- Why don't you

1044
00:50:41.125 --> 00:50:43.649
just write on your own?
I mean. what is stopping you?

1045
00:50:43.823 --> 00:50:46.913
- It's not that simple.
- I think it is. because--

1046
00:50:47.087 --> 00:50:48.393
- Mm-mm.

1047
00:50:48.567 --> 00:50:49.611
- You have this trust fund.
right?

1048
00:50:50.177 --> 00:50:52.136
You could just go off and write.
Be free.

1049
00:50:52.745 --> 00:50:54.225
- No. I--
- You've got this incredible

1050
00:50:54.399 --> 00:50:56.314
safety net that not
a lot of people have.

1051
00:50:57.141 --> 00:50:59.012
Why not use it?

1052
00:50:59.186 --> 00:51:01.232
- I don't want to look back
and wonder if I made it because

1053
00:51:01.406 --> 00:51:04.887
I'm actually talented or because
I'm just privileged.

1054
00:51:05.062 --> 00:51:05.801
You know?

1055
00:51:05.975 --> 00:51:06.715
- Hmm...

1056
00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:12.156
And here I thought all
rich people loved being rich.
but you...

1057
00:51:12.634 --> 00:51:15.289
are an enigma. Winnie Rhodes.

1058
00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:21.339
- Enigma.
- A complicated. selfless...

1059
00:51:23.123 --> 00:51:25.734
giant-eyed. beautiful...
[chuckling]

1060
00:51:26.344 --> 00:51:28.563
...wonderful enigma.

1061
00:51:34.047 --> 00:51:36.136
Oh!
- Oh. uh...

1062
00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:37.659
- Oh. that's. that is...
- It's okay.

1063
00:51:37.833 --> 00:51:39.183
- Really not how
I wanted that to go.

1064
00:51:39.357 --> 00:51:41.054
- It's totally okay! Um...
- Um...

1065
00:51:41.228 --> 00:51:43.274
- Do you have some soda water?
- So... yeah. Soda water.

1066
00:51:43.448 --> 00:51:45.580
I've got soda...

1067
00:51:47.408 --> 00:51:49.976
So how about. actually.
why don't you just. um...

1068
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:51.499
Why don't you just throw

1069
00:51:51.673 --> 00:51:53.545
this on. and I'll pop
that in the wash?

1070
00:51:53.719 --> 00:51:55.808
- Awesome. thank you.
- Right. Uh...

1071
00:51:56.504 --> 00:51:57.418
- It's okay.

1072
00:52:01.553 --> 00:52:03.642
- Do you happen
to be a fan of old movies?

1073
00:52:05.122 --> 00:52:06.340
[Winnie]: Love them!

1074
00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:09.865
- Yes!

1075
00:52:10.039 --> 00:52:11.606
[indistinct TV chatter]

1076
00:52:13.739 --> 00:52:15.175
Oh. this is my favourite part.

1077
00:52:19.048 --> 00:52:21.355
Humphrey Bogart
is an absolute legend.

1078
00:52:22.574 --> 00:52:24.358
[soft music]

1079
00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:16.193
[playful music]

1080
00:53:22.416 --> 00:53:23.330
- Ew!

1081
00:53:39.041 --> 00:53:40.217
Ty...

1082
00:53:41.087 --> 00:53:42.654
- Winnie? What are you--

1083
00:53:42.828 --> 00:53:45.004
- I think I got the stain out.

1084
00:53:45.178 --> 00:53:47.615
Oh wow. Ty. Mate. you're early.

1085
00:53:47.789 --> 00:53:49.487
Um...

1086
00:53:49.661 --> 00:53:51.010
- Dad. this whole time.
you've been seeing Winnie?

1087
00:53:51.184 --> 00:53:53.099
- How do you know even know?

1088
00:53:53.273 --> 00:53:54.796
- He's been coming
to the community centre.

1089
00:53:54.970 --> 00:53:57.016
And were you ever going
to tell me you had a son?

1090
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:59.148
- Of course. listen--
- And whose is that?

1091
00:54:00.193 --> 00:54:03.979
- Uh... I genuinely
have no clue.

1092
00:54:04.153 --> 00:54:07.026
- Right. Forget it.
I gotta go.

1093
00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:08.854
- No. Winnie. I can explain!

1094
00:54:09.028 --> 00:54:09.985
Well. I can't explain

1095
00:54:10.159 --> 00:54:11.030
the mysterious nightie.

1096
00:54:11.204 --> 00:54:12.031
but I can explain Ty!

1097
00:54:13.598 --> 00:54:14.425
[sighs]

1098
00:54:16.165 --> 00:54:17.254
[soft music]

1099
00:54:22.346 --> 00:54:24.739
[sighs]
God. you're an idiot.

1100
00:54:28.047 --> 00:54:29.396
[breathing deeply]

1101
00:54:37.186 --> 00:54:39.885
- Enter! Oh. Winnie!

1102
00:54:40.059 --> 00:54:42.191
- Hi.
- Just the girl I wanted to see.

1103
00:54:42.670 --> 00:54:44.933
- I was hoping I could talk
to you about my column.

1104
00:54:45.107 --> 00:54:46.631
- Yes! It's a smash.

1105
00:54:46.805 --> 00:54:48.589
Now. I'm thinking
we turn it into a book.

1106
00:54:48.763 --> 00:54:50.548
- Uh...
- I mean.
I've already been in touch

1107
00:54:50.722 --> 00:54:52.593
with the best publisher
in the nation.

1108
00:54:52.767 --> 00:54:55.422
They love the idea.
- A... A book? What?

1109
00:54:55.596 --> 00:54:58.207
- Yes! Yes. we'll take
your existing posts

1110
00:54:58.382 --> 00:54:59.687
and then you can expand
upon them.

1111
00:55:00.471 --> 00:55:02.908
Maybe add in some dating tips.
things like that.

1112
00:55:03.082 --> 00:55:03.865
It'll be an easy read.

1113
00:55:04.039 --> 00:55:05.693
- Right.

1114
00:55:05.867 --> 00:55:06.999
W...Why would people
want to buy a book of posts

1115
00:55:07.173 --> 00:55:08.479
they've already read?

1116
00:55:08.653 --> 00:55:09.697
- For the extra content!

1117
00:55:10.219 --> 00:55:12.613
I published a book
of tweets last year.

1118
00:55:13.092 --> 00:55:15.268
Trust me. audiences crave
books like this.

1119
00:55:15.442 --> 00:55:17.183
- Right. uh...
There's just something that I--

1120
00:55:17.357 --> 00:55:18.793
- I was in touch
with the papers!

1121
00:55:18.967 --> 00:55:21.405
The Times wants to do
a feature on Y-O-U!

1122
00:55:21.579 --> 00:55:23.189
- Huh. wait. what?

1123
00:55:23.363 --> 00:55:25.844
What about our deal
to keep my anonymity?

1124
00:55:26.018 --> 00:55:28.977
- Well. sweetie. anonymity
works fine for a blog.

1125
00:55:29.151 --> 00:55:32.938
but for a book. we...
we really need
to know the author.

1126
00:55:33.112 --> 00:55:35.244
Do you know what I mean?
Like. it's part of the package!

1127
00:55:35.723 --> 00:55:36.594
The big reveal!

1128
00:55:36.768 --> 00:55:38.639
- He has a son. Okay?

1129
00:55:38.813 --> 00:55:40.989
He happens to be
the father of one
of the kids I mentor.

1130
00:55:41.163 --> 00:55:43.252
and I just.
I can't do it. Inga. okay?

1131
00:55:43.427 --> 00:55:44.558
It's... It's different now.

1132
00:55:44.732 --> 00:55:46.168
- Excuse me?

1133
00:55:46.473 --> 00:55:48.388
- I can't keep writing
about him.

1134
00:55:49.258 --> 00:55:51.086
Um... I'm done.

1135
00:55:53.828 --> 00:55:55.961
- Do you think just because
he's procreated that

1136
00:55:56.135 --> 00:55:56.918
that will elicit my sympathy?

1137
00:55:57.092 --> 00:55:58.833
- No...

1138
00:55:59.007 --> 00:56:01.836
- This book will launch
your writing career. Winnie.

1139
00:56:02.010 --> 00:56:05.274
- Right. and I am so
grateful for that. Really. I am.

1140
00:56:05.449 --> 00:56:06.275
But Inga--

1141
00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:08.060
- But what?! What?!

1142
00:56:08.582 --> 00:56:11.193
You... Oh. you have feelings
for him?

1143
00:56:12.107 --> 00:56:13.413
Oh. you want me to play mommy!

1144
00:56:13.587 --> 00:56:14.371
Give you a little
huggy wuggy?

1145
00:56:14.545 --> 00:56:16.285
Is that it? Huh?

1146
00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:18.636
Get over it. Winnie!
I don't pay you to feel.

1147
00:56:18.810 --> 00:56:22.901
- Okay. I just think
that if you give me a week
to date other people.

1148
00:56:23.075 --> 00:56:24.859
I can write about somebody else.
I promise you.

1149
00:56:25.033 --> 00:56:27.166
I can write just as good
about other people.

1150
00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:30.909
- Fine! If it will get you over
this schoolgirl infatuation.

1151
00:56:31.083 --> 00:56:35.392
But I expect
you to start turning
in content for the book ASAP.

1152
00:56:35.566 --> 00:56:37.437
- Whatever you need. Inga!

1153
00:56:37.611 --> 00:56:39.396
- Don't touch my desk. Winnie.

1154
00:56:40.788 --> 00:56:43.182
We're done.
- Yes. yes!

1155
00:56:47.012 --> 00:56:48.013
- Are you mad at me?

1156
00:56:49.275 --> 00:56:52.191
- No. mate. I'm not mad.

1157
00:56:53.322 --> 00:56:57.065
- I'm sorry about...
about the nightgown.

1158
00:56:58.197 --> 00:56:59.416
And the GPS. and...

1159
00:57:00.417 --> 00:57:01.679
dyeing your mouth red.

1160
00:57:02.462 --> 00:57:04.812
I. uh... It was all me.

1161
00:57:04.986 --> 00:57:07.206
[scoffs]

1162
00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:09.164
I mean. if I had known
it was Winnie that you were
dating. then...

1163
00:57:09.991 --> 00:57:10.992
[sighs]

1164
00:57:11.166 --> 00:57:12.124
Moral of the story is I...

1165
00:57:13.212 --> 00:57:15.170
I shouldn't have been messing
with your dates.

1166
00:57:16.302 --> 00:57:17.259
I'm sorry.

1167
00:57:17.999 --> 00:57:18.696
- Thanks.

1168
00:57:20.001 --> 00:57:21.350
You know. I figured it was you.

1169
00:57:21.525 --> 00:57:24.832
- I think I'm just nervous...

1170
00:57:25.006 --> 00:57:29.315
about you actually liking
someone. You know?

1171
00:57:29.489 --> 00:57:33.014
It's just been you and me
for so long. and...

1172
00:57:33.188 --> 00:57:35.713
- Hey. you know I was actually
scared to introduce you?

1173
00:57:37.410 --> 00:57:38.542
You can be quite
the harsh critic. Ty.

1174
00:57:38.716 --> 00:57:40.021
- Yeah. I know.

1175
00:57:41.022 --> 00:57:43.198
But I don't think
you should give up.

1176
00:57:43.372 --> 00:57:45.157
She's... She's actually
really cool.

1177
00:57:46.332 --> 00:57:48.073
She helped me ask Jada out.

1178
00:57:49.683 --> 00:57:51.685
She's a really nice lady.

1179
00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:55.341
I'll try not to be
so critical anymore.

1180
00:57:55.515 --> 00:57:57.038
- Thanks. Ty.

1181
00:57:59.084 --> 00:58:00.085
Yeah.

1182
00:58:01.086 --> 00:58:03.305
[soft music]

1183
00:58:11.139 --> 00:58:13.098
[sighs]
- This is garbage.

1184
00:58:18.712 --> 00:58:20.279
[phone vibrating]

1185
00:58:23.456 --> 00:58:25.023
Oh. hey. Mom.
- Hi. Winnie!

1186
00:58:26.154 --> 00:58:27.460
I was just reading your column.

1187
00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:30.289
You are Luckless. yes?

1188
00:58:30.463 --> 00:58:32.900
- Uh. yes. why? Who's asking?

1189
00:58:33.074 --> 00:58:36.251
[sighs]
- Some of those jokes
are a little crude. darling.

1190
00:58:37.035 --> 00:58:39.646
And I noticed that you're
relying very heavily on slang.

1191
00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:42.431
[chuckling nervously]
- Okay. Mom. since when
do you read Mush?

1192
00:58:42.606 --> 00:58:44.042
- Well. I was curious!

1193
00:58:45.391 --> 00:58:47.611
The women at beauty salon
couldn't stop talking about it.

1194
00:58:48.612 --> 00:58:50.918
And that boy. the Player.

1195
00:58:51.092 --> 00:58:53.094
he sounds like a good fit.

1196
00:58:53.268 --> 00:58:55.270
- Yeah. I'm actually
not seeing him anymore.

1197
00:58:56.141 --> 00:58:57.795
- Did your posture just change?

1198
00:58:58.665 --> 00:59:00.145
You sound like you're slouching.
honey.

1199
00:59:00.319 --> 00:59:02.495
- Okay. well. um...

1200
00:59:02.669 --> 00:59:05.890
Mom. I. I... I really actually
have to get back to work.
so I gotta go.

1201
00:59:06.064 --> 00:59:07.065
- Oh. okay.

1202
00:59:07.239 --> 00:59:09.110
Well. hang on to that young boy.

1203
00:59:09.284 --> 00:59:12.244
You know how your mummy
loves a British accent.

1204
00:59:12.418 --> 00:59:14.202
- Okay. Mom. Bye.

1205
00:59:18.293 --> 00:59:19.164
What?

1206
00:59:20.992 --> 00:59:22.297
- And here we are.

1207
00:59:22.471 --> 00:59:23.429
This is where
our associates are.

1208
00:59:23.603 --> 00:59:24.430
we have a boardroom back there.

1209
00:59:24.604 --> 00:59:26.171
but this is the guy.

1210
00:59:26.345 --> 00:59:30.044
Ret. this is Jason Byrd.
Guy's got a great arm.

1211
00:59:31.045 --> 00:59:32.438
[light music]

1212
00:59:40.141 --> 00:59:41.752
- I liked him. Good kid.

1213
00:59:42.709 --> 00:59:45.190
That's the kind of player
we need more of around here.

1214
00:59:45.712 --> 00:59:49.368
You know. humble. hard-working.
in it for the love of the game

1215
00:59:50.064 --> 00:59:52.327
and not because he wants
all the latest sneakers.

1216
00:59:52.501 --> 00:59:54.025
- Well. he's a diamond
in the rough.

1217
00:59:54.199 --> 00:59:56.201
But we still need
those big wins like Dirk. Ret.

1218
00:59:57.071 --> 00:59:58.769
Not that I've got any chance
of signing him now.

1219
01:00:00.292 --> 01:00:01.641
- Why?

1220
01:00:02.511 --> 01:00:04.078
Is something going
on with that girl?

1221
01:00:04.383 --> 01:00:06.472
- Uh. she's just ignoring me.

1222
01:00:06.646 --> 01:00:08.387
I guess you can count
me out of the gala.

1223
01:00:08.561 --> 01:00:10.519
- Maybe she's just
busy with work.

1224
01:00:10.694 --> 01:00:13.653
- No. no. I just dropped
the ball and didn't
tell her about Ty.

1225
01:00:13.827 --> 01:00:17.091
I mean. I wanted to do it
the right way and introduce them
but...

1226
01:00:17.265 --> 01:00:19.877
He walked in on one of our dates
and now she's ghosting me.

1227
01:00:20.051 --> 01:00:23.010
- Ghosting? Hold on. she died?

1228
01:00:23.184 --> 01:00:25.143
- No. Ret. you old boot.

1229
01:00:25.578 --> 01:00:28.537
Ghosting is when
someone you're dating
stops responding to you.

1230
01:00:28.712 --> 01:00:30.061
- Ah...
[chuckling]

1231
01:00:30.235 --> 01:00:31.802
- I totally understand

1232
01:00:31.976 --> 01:00:33.542
why so many women hated
me for ghosting them.

1233
01:00:33.717 --> 01:00:35.066
It's really insensitive.

1234
01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:37.242
- Have you tried
a grand gesture?

1235
01:00:37.416 --> 01:00:39.548
Like a good romantic comedy?

1236
01:00:39.723 --> 01:00:43.944
You show up unexpectedly
with a boom box over your head.

1237
01:00:44.118 --> 01:00:48.253
If you want to come
to the party. you know my terms.

1238
01:00:48.427 --> 01:00:50.821
- A grand gesture?
- Think big.

1239
01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:56.043
- Now let's move on to
the Luckless column.

1240
01:00:56.217 --> 01:00:57.262
Winnie! Winnie.

1241
01:00:57.436 --> 01:00:58.785
The numbers are tanking dear.

1242
01:00:58.959 --> 01:01:00.134
it's time to bring back
the Player.

1243
01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:01.832
- Well I. uh...

1244
01:01:02.006 --> 01:01:03.050
- Okay. okay!

1245
01:01:04.573 --> 01:01:08.316
I'm sensing you're about
to give me a whole energy
here of excuses.

1246
01:01:08.490 --> 01:01:12.146
and I'm gonna need
you to change that around
to a whole energy of solutions.

1247
01:01:12.625 --> 01:01:14.453
Yeah. Winnie. Help me help you.

1248
01:01:14.627 --> 01:01:17.238
[all snapping]
Help me help you. Mm-hmm!

1249
01:01:18.283 --> 01:01:20.633
Help me help you!

1250
01:01:21.765 --> 01:01:24.681
Pierre. like you mean it!
Yeah. okay.

1251
01:01:28.772 --> 01:01:30.687
- They're so happy.
- Mmm.

1252
01:01:31.775 --> 01:01:33.515
[TV shuts off]

1253
01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:37.911
- Uh. okay! First of all. I was
really invested in that movie.

1254
01:01:38.085 --> 01:01:41.959
Second of all. how long is this
pity party gonna go on for?

1255
01:01:42.133 --> 01:01:43.612
[sighs]
You need a plan. Winnie.

1256
01:01:45.876 --> 01:01:49.923
- Okay. well. I'll make up
some posts and I'll pretend
that the real Player is back.

1257
01:01:50.097 --> 01:01:51.446
And Inga. she won't know
the difference.

1258
01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:53.057
[Holden]: Winnie Rhodes!

1259
01:01:54.841 --> 01:01:58.192
- Did you hear that?
Or have I had too much wine?

1260
01:01:59.585 --> 01:02:02.109
[Holden]: Hey!
- What's he doing here?

1261
01:02:02.283 --> 01:02:05.896
- Is that Player?
What's he doing?!

1262
01:02:06.070 --> 01:02:08.202
[Holden]: Winnie!
- I'm not sure. just. uh...

1263
01:02:09.464 --> 01:02:10.378
- Winnie Rhodes!

1264
01:02:16.341 --> 01:02:18.604
- Wha... What are
you doing here?!

1265
01:02:18.778 --> 01:02:21.128
- I gotta to talk to you!
- Holden!

1266
01:02:21.302 --> 01:02:23.000
- Okay. I'm gonna start
singing.

1267
01:02:23.174 --> 01:02:25.219
- No! No. no. no. Holden!

1268
01:02:25.393 --> 01:02:27.308
[Holden]: And all of your
neighbours are gonna hate
you for it!

1269
01:02:27.482 --> 01:02:30.137
- No. no! Holden. Holden. don't!

1270
01:02:30.311 --> 01:02:34.272
- This is for Winnie Rhodes.
everyone! For Winnie Rhodes!

1271
01:02:34.446 --> 01:02:36.013
- No! Holden. no!

1272
01:02:36.187 --> 01:02:38.058
[instrumental music]

1273
01:02:39.364 --> 01:02:41.758
[singing off-key]: It had
to be you!

1274
01:02:43.498 --> 01:02:44.586
[scoffs]

1275
01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:47.328
- Okay. are there two cats
fighting in the alleyway.

1276
01:02:47.502 --> 01:02:49.374
or is that his singing voice?

1277
01:02:49.548 --> 01:02:50.592
- That's his singing voice!

1278
01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:52.899
- Skeetley-da!

1279
01:02:53.073 --> 01:02:55.554
- How have you still
not learned the lyrics?!

1280
01:02:55.728 --> 01:03:00.037
- Dee-dah! It had to be... you!

1281
01:03:00.211 --> 01:03:02.039
- Holden. no!
Okay. fine! Fine. fine. fine!
fine! I'll talk to you. Just...

1282
01:03:02.213 --> 01:03:03.083
I'll talk to you!

1283
01:03:03.257 --> 01:03:04.258
Please just stop singing.

1284
01:03:04.432 --> 01:03:05.477
[laughing]

1285
01:03:05.651 --> 01:03:07.305
I'll just. I'll come down. okay?

1286
01:03:07.479 --> 01:03:08.436
- Okay.

1287
01:03:09.611 --> 01:03:10.482
God...

1288
01:03:11.222 --> 01:03:12.092
[music stops]

1289
01:03:13.224 --> 01:03:14.007
[chuckling]

1290
01:03:14.181 --> 01:03:15.139
- I'm an idiot.

1291
01:03:16.531 --> 01:03:18.316
Where have you been. Win?

1292
01:03:20.057 --> 01:03:21.885
- I. uh... When I found out
about Ty. I--

1293
01:03:22.059 --> 01:03:24.583
- I know what's going on.
- You do?

1294
01:03:25.105 --> 01:03:27.542
- You got scared.
I'm scared too. Win.

1295
01:03:28.065 --> 01:03:32.069
- Well. it's not that.
I mean. it is sort of that.

1296
01:03:32.417 --> 01:03:33.461
but um...

1297
01:03:34.419 --> 01:03:35.855
Holden. my job--

1298
01:03:36.029 --> 01:03:38.075
- You can write whatever
you want. Job or no job.

1299
01:03:38.249 --> 01:03:39.076
You're brilliant.

1300
01:03:41.121 --> 01:03:42.688
- You're being too kind.
- No. I'm being honest.

1301
01:03:43.297 --> 01:03:45.822
I mean. if this job
is that important to you.
I'll support it.

1302
01:03:46.518 --> 01:03:47.562
I just want you to be happy.

1303
01:03:47.736 --> 01:03:49.695
But Ty really likes you.

1304
01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:53.046
- Now what?

1305
01:03:54.787 --> 01:03:56.049
- You could quit ghosting me.

1306
01:03:57.050 --> 01:03:58.051
That's absolute torture. that.

1307
01:04:00.053 --> 01:04:02.969
Tomorrow. my boss
is having a dinner
and Ty's gonna be there.

1308
01:04:03.143 --> 01:04:06.103
and I want everyone
to meet the right way.
Will you come?

1309
01:04:06.277 --> 01:04:07.191
- I'd love to.

1310
01:04:09.193 --> 01:04:12.065
- And keep Saturday open.
- For what?

1311
01:04:12.239 --> 01:04:14.154
[chuckling]
- You'll see.

1312
01:04:17.592 --> 01:04:19.116
See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

1313
01:04:19.290 --> 01:04:21.901
- Do you know how hard it was to
find a boom-box?

1314
01:04:22.075 --> 01:04:23.076
- Yeah. I bet!

1315
01:04:24.208 --> 01:04:26.297
- Tomorrow!
- Tomorrow.

1316
01:04:28.690 --> 01:04:30.127
[Holden laughing]

1317
01:04:31.693 --> 01:04:32.433
[soft music]

1318
01:04:32.607 --> 01:04:34.131
[chuckling]

1319
01:04:36.655 --> 01:04:38.091
I...
[laughing]

1320
01:04:47.231 --> 01:04:48.232
Okay.

1321
01:05:06.598 --> 01:05:07.991
[phone vibrating]

1322
01:05:12.473 --> 01:05:13.866
- Hello?

1323
01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:16.042
- Your numbers
are through the roof.

1324
01:05:16.216 --> 01:05:18.175
The fans are buzzing
about Player's return.

1325
01:05:18.349 --> 01:05:20.873
Too sentimental
for my own tastes.

1326
01:05:21.047 --> 01:05:23.528
but the metrics are great.
- Okay! Yeah. that's good.

1327
01:05:23.702 --> 01:05:26.879
- And how are the last chapters
of the book coming along?

1328
01:05:27.053 --> 01:05:29.055
- Well. um.
I...I almost finished it.

1329
01:05:29.229 --> 01:05:33.190
but actually. uh.
I wanted to talk you about
the break-up post. um...

1330
01:05:33.364 --> 01:05:34.931
- We can discuss that later.

1331
01:05:35.105 --> 01:05:36.845
I've moved the Times shoot
up to today.

1332
01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:38.499
- Wait. what?!

1333
01:05:38.673 --> 01:05:39.848
- We are rushing the book
launch to next week.

1334
01:05:40.023 --> 01:05:41.024
- Inga!

1335
01:05:41.198 --> 01:05:42.329
- We need to ride this momentu!

1336
01:05:42.503 --> 01:05:43.156
You know. we've only got

1337
01:05:43.330 --> 01:05:44.636
one more column.

1338
01:05:44.810 --> 01:05:46.420
and then we're
hitting the shelves.

1339
01:05:46.594 --> 01:05:47.552
So meet me
at the office in three hours.

1340
01:05:47.726 --> 01:05:49.075
And please. Winnie.

1341
01:05:49.249 --> 01:05:50.859
detangle your hair
before you arrive.

1342
01:05:51.034 --> 01:05:52.165
for everyone's sake.

1343
01:05:55.081 --> 01:05:57.344
[sighs]
- No. no. no. no. no!

1344
01:05:57.518 --> 01:05:58.780
Ugh!

1345
01:06:00.130 --> 01:06:01.392
[indistinct chatter]

1346
01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:08.007
- It's fine...
- Dad. chill! You're making me--

1347
01:06:08.181 --> 01:06:10.096
- Hi! Hi. hi!
- Hey!

1348
01:06:10.270 --> 01:06:11.489
Sorry. I'm late.
- It's good to see you.

1349
01:06:11.663 --> 01:06:13.143
Hey!

1350
01:06:15.014 --> 01:06:16.929
- Wow. you look beautiful.

1351
01:06:17.103 --> 01:06:19.714
- So. are you done ghosting
my dad now?

1352
01:06:20.367 --> 01:06:22.543
I mean. I thought he was
gonna have an aneurysm there
for a few days.

1353
01:06:22.717 --> 01:06:24.937
[laughing]
- Really?

1354
01:06:25.111 --> 01:06:26.895
- No. he's just a teenager.
He doesn't know what
he's talking about.

1355
01:06:27.070 --> 01:06:28.071
- Yeah. I do!

1356
01:06:29.289 --> 01:06:31.378
He was stalking
your social media nonstop.

1357
01:06:31.552 --> 01:06:33.598
- Oh!
- Total creep status.

1358
01:06:33.772 --> 01:06:35.774
- Ty! Shall we?
[awkward chuckling]

1359
01:06:38.081 --> 01:06:38.864
You're grounded.

1360
01:06:39.038 --> 01:06:40.474
[light music]

1361
01:06:40.648 --> 01:06:44.087
- Oh. hi. Good to see you.
- Young man...

1362
01:06:44.261 --> 01:06:46.350
- Ret. This is Winnie.

1363
01:06:46.524 --> 01:06:48.917
- Hi.
- It's so nice to meet you.

1364
01:06:49.092 --> 01:06:51.616
- You too. I've heard
only great things.

1365
01:06:52.443 --> 01:06:54.662
- Oh. really?
- Oh yeah. yeah.

1366
01:06:54.836 --> 01:06:56.925
Holden always talks about
how lucky he is to have
a boss like you.

1367
01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:58.971
- Well...
- I like her.

1368
01:06:59.145 --> 01:07:00.929
She knows that compliments
are a way to my heart.

1369
01:07:01.104 --> 01:07:03.802
- Well. in that case.
uh. you have a great smile.

1370
01:07:03.976 --> 01:07:05.369
[chuckling]

1371
01:07:07.588 --> 01:07:09.112
- Off to a great start.

1372
01:07:13.246 --> 01:07:14.160
- Okay!

1373
01:07:17.250 --> 01:07:19.122
[all laughing]

1374
01:07:19.426 --> 01:07:21.820
- So I programmed
his GPS to only direct

1375
01:07:21.994 --> 01:07:24.953
him to a hair plug doctor.
and Toupees and Beyond.

1376
01:07:25.128 --> 01:07:26.433
[laughing]

1377
01:07:26.607 --> 01:07:27.913
- I mean. how did
you even do that?

1378
01:07:28.087 --> 01:07:30.220
- Um. I'm good with technology.

1379
01:07:30.394 --> 01:07:33.092
My generation
was practically born with
tablets glued to our hands.

1380
01:07:33.266 --> 01:07:34.528
[laughing]

1381
01:07:35.181 --> 01:07:36.835
- If he's balding.
you can tell me.

1382
01:07:37.009 --> 01:07:39.968
- Oh. hi! Talking about me?
- Don't worry about it!

1383
01:07:40.143 --> 01:07:41.448
[Ty]: Some other bald guy.
- Oh!

1384
01:07:41.622 --> 01:07:43.102
[Winnie]: Inside joke.
- Oh...

1385
01:07:44.451 --> 01:07:46.236
- I like her.

1386
01:07:46.410 --> 01:07:47.498
[Winnie whispers]: You can tell
if he's balding. Go on.

1387
01:07:47.672 --> 01:07:48.760
[Ty]: I mean. he could be.

1388
01:07:49.456 --> 01:07:51.154
- Really?
- You're in.

1389
01:07:55.767 --> 01:07:58.378
- Well. thanks for coming.
You were a real hit.

1390
01:07:59.597 --> 01:08:00.511
One more thing.

1391
01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:04.254
Come with me tomorrow
to the Insiders Gala.

1392
01:08:05.168 --> 01:08:07.561
- Are you serious?
- As my girlfriend.

1393
01:08:09.607 --> 01:08:10.564
- Just kiss already!

1394
01:08:19.312 --> 01:08:22.533
- I'll. uh...
I'll figure it out.

1395
01:08:22.707 --> 01:08:24.056
- Okay. Let's find a way.

1396
01:08:33.718 --> 01:08:34.719
I'm gonna see you tomorrow?

1397
01:08:36.024 --> 01:08:37.156
[soft music]

1398
01:08:39.550 --> 01:08:40.507
[car driving off]

1399
01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:46.557
Thanks for the advice!
[laughing]

1400
01:08:47.123 --> 01:08:48.167
Romantic!

1401
01:08:57.611 --> 01:09:00.962
- Absolutely not. If you pull
out of this book deal.

1402
01:09:01.137 --> 01:09:03.791
I will sick every single
attorney in the city on you

1403
01:09:03.965 --> 01:09:06.054
and I will eat you alive.

1404
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:07.534
Got it?

1405
01:09:09.101 --> 01:09:11.364
You signed on to do a break-up
column and a tell-all book.

1406
01:09:12.322 --> 01:09:15.151
Well. I want a break-up! Got it?

1407
01:09:16.413 --> 01:09:18.328
- Yeah. I understand.
- Good!

1408
01:09:18.502 --> 01:09:21.635
I expect to see
your post tonight.

1409
01:09:24.029 --> 01:09:25.291
Don't disappoint me.

1410
01:09:38.130 --> 01:09:39.653
[soft music]

1411
01:09:43.091 --> 01:09:45.572
- Wow.
- Too much?

1412
01:09:46.791 --> 01:09:49.489
- No. No. you're perfect.

1413
01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:53.406
[upbeat music]

1414
01:09:58.106 --> 01:09:59.412
[indistinct chatter]

1415
01:09:59.586 --> 01:10:01.022
Here we are.

1416
01:10:08.204 --> 01:10:09.770
I have to say that...

1417
01:10:12.164 --> 01:10:14.297
it's been a long time
since I've enjoyed spending
time with someone this much.

1418
01:10:15.602 --> 01:10:16.864
- Yeah. me too.

1419
01:10:17.038 --> 01:10:18.170
Uh...

1420
01:10:20.172 --> 01:10:22.218
Holden. there's just
something I've been. um...

1421
01:10:22.392 --> 01:10:24.002
I've been meaning to tell you.

1422
01:10:24.176 --> 01:10:26.004
- Yeah. you can
tell me anything.

1423
01:10:26.178 --> 01:10:27.223
- Uh...

1424
01:10:30.269 --> 01:10:33.098
Well. the. uh. the column
I'm writing right now.

1425
01:10:33.272 --> 01:10:35.274
it's very personal.

1426
01:10:35.622 --> 01:10:37.058
- Okay.

1427
01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:39.452
- What I'm trying to say is
that. um...

1428
01:10:41.149 --> 01:10:45.632
Tomorrow. there's a big
release. and well.
I'm supposed to...

1429
01:10:45.806 --> 01:10:49.332
- Hey! Hey. there he is!
- Hey!

1430
01:10:49.506 --> 01:10:50.855
- Wicked.

1431
01:10:51.029 --> 01:10:52.987
- Would you excuse me?
I just need to...

1432
01:10:53.161 --> 01:10:54.772
go to the restroom.

1433
01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:59.994
- Holden! Please tell me
you have some deals for me.

1434
01:11:00.168 --> 01:11:01.213
- Uh. you see that...

1435
01:11:01.387 --> 01:11:03.302
You see that guy right there?

1436
01:11:03.476 --> 01:11:06.087
The CEO of the biggest sports
department store on the planet.

1437
01:11:07.045 --> 01:11:08.568
Just happens to
be my golfing buddy.

1438
01:11:10.178 --> 01:11:11.441
[rhythmic music]

1439
01:11:13.443 --> 01:11:16.359
- We expected--
- Oh! Hi. Ret!

1440
01:11:16.533 --> 01:11:18.012
- Oh. there you are. Winnie.

1441
01:11:18.186 --> 01:11:20.188
- How are you?
It's good to see you.

1442
01:11:20.363 --> 01:11:22.060
- I'm doing a lot better

1443
01:11:22.234 --> 01:11:25.193
now that my top agent has
his head out of his rear end.

1444
01:11:25.368 --> 01:11:26.369
[laughing]

1445
01:11:26.543 --> 01:11:27.892
And you to thank for that.

1446
01:11:28.066 --> 01:11:30.373
- Oh no. no. I can't take credit
for that.

1447
01:11:30.547 --> 01:11:31.896
- Oh. yes. you can.

1448
01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:34.507
- Would you excuse me?
- Yeah!

1449
01:11:34.681 --> 01:11:36.030
- I just. I need to. um...
- Sure. absolutely.

1450
01:11:36.204 --> 01:11:37.597
Hmm.

1451
01:11:37.771 --> 01:11:39.556
- So. when do you think
I'd get paid?

1452
01:11:39.730 --> 01:11:41.906
- Well. um. that depends...

1453
01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:43.081
- Well. hello there!

1454
01:11:44.038 --> 01:11:45.301
I'm Dirk.

1455
01:11:45.475 --> 01:11:47.564
Are you texting your boyfriend?

1456
01:11:47.738 --> 01:11:49.827
- Actually.
I'm reading Luckless.

1457
01:11:50.610 --> 01:11:53.570
- Luckless? No way.
I love that column!

1458
01:11:53.744 --> 01:11:55.354
Player is a hot mess.

1459
01:11:55.528 --> 01:11:57.095
- Wait. what are
we talking about?

1460
01:11:57.269 --> 01:11:59.097
- Oh. it's the most popular
dating column ever.

1461
01:11:59.271 --> 01:12:01.404
- This girl is dating
this guy who's a player.

1462
01:12:01.578 --> 01:12:03.928
and he's a disaster.
- Okay.

1463
01:12:04.102 --> 01:12:06.931
- And they went on a date.
and a woman he used to see--

1464
01:12:07.105 --> 01:12:08.324
- Poured a drink on him!

1465
01:12:08.498 --> 01:12:09.499
- Remember the doorbell
ditching?

1466
01:12:09.673 --> 01:12:11.022
- No. no. no. the jazz date!

1467
01:12:11.196 --> 01:12:12.937
[singing off-key]:
It had to be you!

1468
01:12:13.111 --> 01:12:14.068
[laughing]

1469
01:12:14.242 --> 01:12:15.940
Awful. awful. awful!

1470
01:12:16.114 --> 01:12:19.073
- I've made my decision.
I'm letting Holden take over.

1471
01:12:19.813 --> 01:12:21.772
He's convinced me
that he's got what it takes.

1472
01:12:22.599 --> 01:12:24.470
I thought for sure he was
faking it with Winnie

1473
01:12:24.644 --> 01:12:28.039
just to get into the parties
so he could sign Dirk. but now--

1474
01:12:32.739 --> 01:12:34.437
[sighs]

1475
01:12:34.611 --> 01:12:36.961
- I can't believe he showed up
to a date with red teeth!

1476
01:12:37.135 --> 01:12:38.963
[laughing]
Oh. yo. Holden.

1477
01:12:39.137 --> 01:12:42.009
You said that
your date works at Mush. right?

1478
01:12:42.183 --> 01:12:44.795
Maybe she knows who Luckless is.
- Excuse me.

1479
01:12:46.144 --> 01:12:47.624
Winnie.
- Holden. don't.

1480
01:12:47.798 --> 01:12:49.147
- All this time you were
writing about me. huh?

1481
01:12:50.409 --> 01:12:51.410
Using me.
that's your big secret.

1482
01:12:51.584 --> 01:12:53.456
- Yeah. and you were using me

1483
01:12:53.630 --> 01:12:56.023
to get to some baseball player.
right?

1484
01:12:56.197 --> 01:12:58.286
I was your ticket in here
so you could get some big
endorsement deal? Is that it?

1485
01:12:58.461 --> 01:13:00.463
- Well. you would know about
putting work in front
of everything!

1486
01:13:00.637 --> 01:13:02.334
Hmm? Wouldn't you?

1487
01:13:02.508 --> 01:13:04.380
Making a fool of me
in front of millions of people!

1488
01:13:04.554 --> 01:13:05.946
Millions!

1489
01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:07.426
Making fun of my
singing voice?!

1490
01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:08.601
I didn't even
want to sing that night!

1491
01:13:08.775 --> 01:13:10.777
- Whoa. wait. Holden. you're--

1492
01:13:10.951 --> 01:13:12.953
- And you used me so that
you could chase your next
big paycheque.

1493
01:13:13.127 --> 01:13:15.434
because guess what?

1494
01:13:15.608 --> 01:13:18.176
This was never about you opening
up so that Ty could have some...
some stability!

1495
01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:19.873
No! This was always about money.

1496
01:13:20.047 --> 01:13:21.048
because that's all
you care about.

1497
01:13:21.222 --> 01:13:22.920
- You honestly think I would

1498
01:13:23.094 --> 01:13:24.269
introduce you to my son
if I wasn't serious about you?

1499
01:13:24.443 --> 01:13:26.227
- Hmm. how would I know. huh?

1500
01:13:26.402 --> 01:13:28.055
You seem like you're pretty good
at hiding who you really are.

1501
01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:31.102
- Well. that makes two of us.
Doesn't it. Luckless?

1502
01:13:32.799 --> 01:13:35.323
- Yep! You're right!
I'm Luckless!

1503
01:13:35.498 --> 01:13:37.543
I hope everybody
enjoyed the show.

1504
01:13:37.717 --> 01:13:40.633
Oh. and one more thing.
Holden here. he is the player!

1505
01:13:40.807 --> 01:13:42.330
- Yeah!
- The one and only!

1506
01:13:42.505 --> 01:13:43.984
[laughing]

1507
01:13:44.158 --> 01:13:46.117
You know what?

1508
01:13:46.291 --> 01:13:48.467
I'm gonna do what I should have
done on that very first date.

1509
01:13:52.428 --> 01:13:54.125
Oh. I'm... I'm so sorry!

1510
01:13:56.214 --> 01:13:58.608
Just for the record.
that was supposed to hit him.
not you. I'm really sorry!

1511
01:14:02.002 --> 01:14:03.700
- That was hilarious!

1512
01:14:06.006 --> 01:14:08.139
[laughing]

1513
01:14:08.313 --> 01:14:10.010
[soft music]

1514
01:14:13.492 --> 01:14:14.580
[laughing]

1515
01:14:20.107 --> 01:14:21.718
- Hey!
- Hey.

1516
01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:23.459
- How'd it go?

1517
01:14:26.505 --> 01:14:29.856
What happened? Winnie!

1518
01:14:30.030 --> 01:14:31.205
[crying]

1519
01:14:36.123 --> 01:14:37.255
Did you tell him?

1520
01:14:38.386 --> 01:14:39.779
- Mm-hmm. Yeah. I told him.

1521
01:14:40.345 --> 01:14:44.218
- Okay. it's gonna be okay.
Come on. Sit down. Come on.

1522
01:14:47.570 --> 01:14:50.224
Don't cry. you're gonna
make me cry. okay?

1523
01:14:52.226 --> 01:14:53.793
You know what always makes
me feel better?

1524
01:14:55.752 --> 01:14:57.057
Eating a snack.

1525
01:14:57.362 --> 01:14:58.406
[chuckling]

1526
01:14:59.712 --> 01:15:00.974
Come on. you want one?

1527
01:15:02.106 --> 01:15:03.368
- Okay.
- Yeah?

1528
01:15:03.542 --> 01:15:05.805
- Cheers.
- Cheers. Cheers.

1529
01:15:06.284 --> 01:15:08.329
It's gonna be okay. Okay?

1530
01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:24.345
[indistinct chatter]

1531
01:15:25.172 --> 01:15:27.566
- Sorry for ruining yet another
one of your events.

1532
01:15:28.611 --> 01:15:30.787
- You're not the only one
to fumble the ball today.

1533
01:15:31.657 --> 01:15:34.138
I shouldn't have let it slip
about our arrangement.

1534
01:15:34.617 --> 01:15:36.096
- Would've been nice.

1535
01:15:37.054 --> 01:15:39.709
No. mate. I'm just not
made for commitment.

1536
01:15:41.145 --> 01:15:42.973
- Just because it didn't work
out with Winnie.

1537
01:15:43.147 --> 01:15:44.409
doesn't mean
that it wasn't worthwhile.

1538
01:15:45.149 --> 01:15:48.282
You let yourself fall.
it's a good thing.

1539
01:15:49.153 --> 01:15:50.458
- Well. at least I got Dirk.

1540
01:15:51.329 --> 01:15:53.070
He's got his shoe deal now.

1541
01:15:53.244 --> 01:15:55.159
- Mm-hmm. sure does.

1542
01:15:56.247 --> 01:15:58.249
[light music]

1543
01:16:01.469 --> 01:16:03.080
[mimicking trumpet fanfare]

1544
01:16:04.298 --> 01:16:06.300
- Big book release day!

1545
01:16:06.474 --> 01:16:07.998
[chuckling]

1546
01:16:08.172 --> 01:16:11.088
Want to get some
celebratory brunch?

1547
01:16:12.524 --> 01:16:15.005
- No thanks. I think I'm
just gonna stay here.

1548
01:16:17.529 --> 01:16:20.140
- I'm really sorry
that I pressured you

1549
01:16:20.314 --> 01:16:22.142
to write about
your personal life.

1550
01:16:22.316 --> 01:16:25.189
- No. no. no. No. You know.
you and Inga were right. okay?

1551
01:16:25.363 --> 01:16:28.366
I was too afraid
to put myself out there

1552
01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:30.107
that I was hiding behind
this persona.

1553
01:16:30.281 --> 01:16:32.370
Okay. maybe I needed this.

1554
01:16:34.154 --> 01:16:37.462
- You know what? I'm gonna
make us some brownies.

1555
01:16:37.636 --> 01:16:40.160
With actual butter.
- Actual butter.

1556
01:16:40.334 --> 01:16:41.988
- And sugar.
- And sugar.

1557
01:16:42.162 --> 01:16:43.076
- And joy.
- And joy!

1558
01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:44.425
- Mm-hmm!
[laughing]

1559
01:16:45.644 --> 01:16:47.124
- Thank you.
- Of course.

1560
01:16:47.298 --> 01:16:48.473
[phone vibrating]

1561
01:16:51.476 --> 01:16:53.043
- Inga. hi!

1562
01:16:53.217 --> 01:16:55.654
- Your last column was fab!

1563
01:16:55.828 --> 01:16:58.265
And I got you a spot
on Wake Up America!

1564
01:16:59.223 --> 01:17:00.616
Get ready to be
a bestselling author!

1565
01:17:02.052 --> 01:17:02.966
- Oh. uh...

1566
01:17:03.967 --> 01:17:05.925
- What did she say?

1567
01:17:06.099 --> 01:17:09.886
- Uh... I'm gonna be
on Wake Up America!

1568
01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:14.064
- You're gonna be
on Wake Up America?!

1569
01:17:14.238 --> 01:17:15.631
- I'm gonna be
on Wake Up America!

1570
01:17:15.805 --> 01:17:18.503
[laughing]
- Oh my gosh! High-five. bestie!

1571
01:17:19.069 --> 01:17:20.592
Yes!
- That was...

1572
01:17:21.071 --> 01:17:22.507
[laughing]

1573
01:17:25.553 --> 01:17:28.252
- 500K? They're lowballing me.

1574
01:17:28.426 --> 01:17:29.427
- You're still a rookie.
Dirk.

1575
01:17:29.601 --> 01:17:30.558
- You know I'm worth triple.

1576
01:17:30.733 --> 01:17:32.604
- It's one shoe deal.

1577
01:17:32.778 --> 01:17:34.084
There's gonna be plenty more
where that came from. trust me.

1578
01:17:34.258 --> 01:17:35.955
- No. no. it's about respect!

1579
01:17:36.129 --> 01:17:37.914
They're not showing me
the respect I deserve.

1580
01:17:38.088 --> 01:17:40.220
- Respect? Respect?!

1581
01:17:40.743 --> 01:17:43.441
You want respect?
Earn it on the field.

1582
01:17:43.615 --> 01:17:45.138
How many homers have you hit?

1583
01:17:45.704 --> 01:17:47.706
How many double plays
have you made? Zero.

1584
01:17:48.185 --> 01:17:50.100
You're not even
on that diamond yet.

1585
01:17:50.796 --> 01:17:52.624
- I'm gonna be the greatest
player in the game.

1586
01:17:53.233 --> 01:17:55.105
Everyone says it!
- Will you?

1587
01:17:56.149 --> 01:17:59.065
That's funny.
because right now. all I see
is an overconfident little prat

1588
01:17:59.805 --> 01:18:00.937
who only cares about
endorsements.

1589
01:18:01.111 --> 01:18:02.503
You want to be great?

1590
01:18:02.678 --> 01:18:05.332
Shut up and play baseball.

1591
01:18:07.117 --> 01:18:08.945
- We're done.

1592
01:18:09.119 --> 01:18:10.294
I'm going with Eric's agency.

1593
01:18:10.947 --> 01:18:13.297
- Fantastic! Enjoy that.

1594
01:18:13.471 --> 01:18:14.602
- Bye. you little zit!

1595
01:18:15.299 --> 01:18:17.040
- Whatever. old man.

1596
01:18:19.738 --> 01:18:21.305
- You were right.

1597
01:18:21.479 --> 01:18:23.307
He's nothing but a little
punk with no work ethic.

1598
01:18:24.264 --> 01:18:26.614
- What are you even doing here?
Go home and be with Ty.

1599
01:18:26.789 --> 01:18:29.400
- He's got a girlfriend now.
too busy for his dad.

1600
01:18:29.574 --> 01:18:31.358
How's that for irony?
- Hmm!

1601
01:18:32.011 --> 01:18:34.753
- Uh. I need a distraction.
- From Winnie.

1602
01:18:36.407 --> 01:18:38.670
"Love is the most important
thing in the world.

1603
01:18:39.453 --> 01:18:42.979
But baseball
is pretty good too."

1604
01:18:43.153 --> 01:18:45.590
- Yogi Berra
always has the answers.

1605
01:18:45.764 --> 01:18:47.766
- Mm-hmm. Sure does.

1606
01:18:49.376 --> 01:18:54.251
So. Mr. CEO. tell me more
about this pitcher. Jason Byrd.

1607
01:18:54.425 --> 01:18:55.339
Gotta sign him.

1608
01:18:56.035 --> 01:18:57.297
- Already got him. Ret.

1609
01:18:59.169 --> 01:18:59.952
- That's my boy.

1610
01:19:00.648 --> 01:19:01.693
[chuckling]

1611
01:19:02.433 --> 01:19:03.521
[exhaling]

1612
01:19:05.001 --> 01:19:05.871
- Ah! There you are.
You're late!

1613
01:19:06.045 --> 01:19:07.917
- I'm 10 minutes early.

1614
01:19:08.091 --> 01:19:09.962
- Huh. Well. it always feels
like you're late.

1615
01:19:10.136 --> 01:19:11.964
Whoa! No. no. people!

1616
01:19:12.138 --> 01:19:13.444
People! Was I not clear. here!

1617
01:19:13.618 --> 01:19:15.098
No processed foods!

1618
01:19:15.533 --> 01:19:17.535
- Inga. this is just like...
it's a lot--

1619
01:19:17.709 --> 01:19:20.190
- I know.
- It's a lot more
than I bargained for.

1620
01:19:20.364 --> 01:19:21.844
Like. I just...
- Right. right. right.

1621
01:19:22.018 --> 01:19:23.976
I get it. I get it.

1622
01:19:24.150 --> 01:19:26.849
I mean.
you're the t-shirt girl.

1623
01:19:27.023 --> 01:19:29.199
The girl who knows
what a fourth down is.

1624
01:19:29.373 --> 01:19:32.028
But what sells is glamour.

1625
01:19:33.029 --> 01:19:34.682
So play the character.

1626
01:19:35.727 --> 01:19:38.121
- Play the character?
- Exactly.

1627
01:19:38.295 --> 01:19:43.387
You're Luckless. the girl
with the most captivating
dating drama on the planet.

1628
01:19:43.561 --> 01:19:46.564
And soon. you'll be
a bestselling author.

1629
01:19:47.565 --> 01:19:50.568
- Uh. Inga... Since you said
if the book was a hit.

1630
01:19:50.742 --> 01:19:51.874
I can write anything I want...

1631
01:19:52.048 --> 01:19:54.354
- Anything within reason. yes.

1632
01:19:54.528 --> 01:19:56.879
- Yeah. well. I want to write
fiction. I've started on--

1633
01:19:57.053 --> 01:19:59.185
- Absolutely not. Never.

1634
01:19:59.664 --> 01:20:01.231
- So what am I allowed to write?

1635
01:20:01.405 --> 01:20:02.972
- You can write anything
you want.

1636
01:20:03.146 --> 01:20:05.061
Uh... Dating faux pas.

1637
01:20:05.235 --> 01:20:07.063
Whether to get botox
or filler... Or both!

1638
01:20:07.237 --> 01:20:08.412
- Inga. this wasn't our deal.

1639
01:20:10.109 --> 01:20:13.417
- Well. Winnie. you wanted
to be a bestselling author.

1640
01:20:14.505 --> 01:20:15.462
I made that happen.

1641
01:20:17.116 --> 01:20:19.771
And I expect you
to act accordingly.

1642
01:20:22.034 --> 01:20:23.296
Don't let me down. Winnie.

1643
01:20:25.168 --> 01:20:26.256
[scoffs]

1644
01:20:27.126 --> 01:20:29.259
Do not put that next
to the veggies!

1645
01:20:31.217 --> 01:20:32.610
[soft music]

1646
01:20:41.749 --> 01:20:43.360
[chuckling]

1647
01:20:45.449 --> 01:20:48.278
[woman]: Welcome the author
of the bestselling Luckless
Guide to Love...

1648
01:20:48.452 --> 01:20:49.366
- Uh. Dad?

1649
01:20:49.540 --> 01:20:50.933
- Winnie Rhodes.

1650
01:20:51.107 --> 01:20:52.586
- Yes. yes!

1651
01:20:53.761 --> 01:20:58.723
- Winnie. your book has been
a big success. What's next?

1652
01:21:01.987 --> 01:21:04.163
- Fiction actually.

1653
01:21:04.772 --> 01:21:08.124
Yeah. my next book started out
as something just for me.

1654
01:21:09.168 --> 01:21:11.649
But then I thought.
why not share it with the world?

1655
01:21:12.519 --> 01:21:15.740
Yeah. I mean. after all.
I can write whatever I want.

1656
01:21:18.134 --> 01:21:19.962
- Yes! Go. girl!

1657
01:21:20.136 --> 01:21:21.789
That's what I'm talking about!

1658
01:21:21.964 --> 01:21:24.531
- For so long. all I wanted
was to be successful.

1659
01:21:24.705 --> 01:21:27.970
I mean. so much so
that I didn't actually
really care what the cost was.

1660
01:21:28.144 --> 01:21:29.972
And then I. uh...

1661
01:21:30.146 --> 01:21:34.890
I ended up losing someone that
meant a lot to me because of it.

1662
01:21:35.064 --> 01:21:37.631
- Dad! Dad. come here! Dad.
- What?

1663
01:21:37.805 --> 01:21:39.982
- You have to watch this.
- Nope.

1664
01:21:40.156 --> 01:21:41.809
- Well. hey. hey--
- Nope!

1665
01:21:41.984 --> 01:21:43.159
- If you're not gonna watch it.
at the very least.

1666
01:21:43.333 --> 01:21:45.117
you have to listen!

1667
01:21:45.291 --> 01:21:46.597
- And I'm actually working
on a novel right now.

1668
01:21:47.250 --> 01:21:50.993
which is about finding someone
who is perfectly imperfect.

1669
01:21:51.167 --> 01:21:52.385
It's called Luck Strikes.

1670
01:21:53.343 --> 01:21:55.214
- Is this about the Player?

1671
01:21:55.388 --> 01:21:58.435
- It's. um... It's actually
about two people.

1672
01:21:59.349 --> 01:22:02.047
Yeah. the Player
is a package deal.

1673
01:22:02.613 --> 01:22:06.182
Yeah. he has a son.
A really. really wonderful son.

1674
01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:12.188
And I once told him. his son.
that honesty is the best policy.

1675
01:22:12.362 --> 01:22:14.059
Because that's what
my dad taught me.

1676
01:22:16.279 --> 01:22:19.760
So. uh. yeah. I feel like
the best way to honour
him is to finally be honest.

1677
01:22:21.066 --> 01:22:23.286
- She's going to grand gesture.

1678
01:22:23.590 --> 01:22:28.117
- My time with the Player.
as you all know it.
was a mess. It was.

1679
01:22:28.291 --> 01:22:29.335
[doorbell ringing]

1680
01:22:31.642 --> 01:22:32.469
[laughing]

1681
01:22:34.123 --> 01:22:35.602
But you know. it wasn't entirely
how I portrayed it.

1682
01:22:37.126 --> 01:22:38.736
- Wow.

1683
01:22:38.910 --> 01:22:41.347
- No. it wasn't all
embarrassing and torturous.

1684
01:22:41.521 --> 01:22:44.481
- Skeetly-beh-bah!

1685
01:22:44.655 --> 01:22:48.485
- Most of it was actually...
really fun.

1686
01:22:48.659 --> 01:22:50.704
And exciting. and...

1687
01:22:54.056 --> 01:22:55.231
It was love.

1688
01:22:58.756 --> 01:23:03.326
I'm sorry to my readers
for not being true to myself.

1689
01:23:06.068 --> 01:23:09.723
Because the truth is.
I fell hard.

1690
01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:11.638
[chuckling]

1691
01:23:13.162 --> 01:23:15.599
And I put my work
ahead of that

1692
01:23:17.079 --> 01:23:18.428
because I had to
play a character.

1693
01:23:18.602 --> 01:23:20.038
But that's not who I am.

1694
01:23:20.996 --> 01:23:22.040
So I'm sorry.

1695
01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:24.608
- That's my best friend.

1696
01:23:27.132 --> 01:23:28.960
- But. uh... no apology

1697
01:23:29.134 --> 01:23:33.051
is complete without
a grand gesture.

1698
01:23:33.747 --> 01:23:37.142
So... here goes.

1699
01:23:37.795 --> 01:23:39.623
[chuckling]
- Called it.

1700
01:23:40.450 --> 01:23:43.192
- Oh. I think she's gonna sing.
- No way.

1701
01:23:44.454 --> 01:23:47.500
[singing shakily]:
It had to be you...

1702
01:23:48.806 --> 01:23:51.200
It had to be you...

1703
01:23:52.462 --> 01:23:56.292
I wandered around
and finally found...

1704
01:23:56.466 --> 01:23:58.685
somebody who...

1705
01:23:59.991 --> 01:24:02.341
made me be true.

1706
01:24:02.515 --> 01:24:04.300
[laughing]
Sorry.

1707
01:24:05.475 --> 01:24:06.998
- Oh no...

1708
01:24:07.172 --> 01:24:08.869
[off-key]: Shibbity-do.
bada-dee-bada-shoo.

1709
01:24:09.044 --> 01:24:10.349
- Oh!

1710
01:24:10.523 --> 01:24:14.136
Shoopity doo!
Oh. that feels good.

1711
01:24:14.310 --> 01:24:15.485
- What is she doing?

1712
01:24:16.138 --> 01:24:17.226
- Oh... Oh. this is really...

1713
01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:18.401
[clears throat]

1714
01:24:18.575 --> 01:24:20.185
[off-key]: It had to be you!

1715
01:24:20.751 --> 01:24:21.795
You. you. you. you!

1716
01:24:23.101 --> 01:24:26.278
Shibbity-shibbity-shibbity!
It had to be you.

1717
01:24:26.452 --> 01:24:27.410
It's 'cause he did that.
Anyway...

1718
01:24:28.541 --> 01:24:33.416
[off-key]: It had to be you!

1719
01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:39.248
- Wow.

1720
01:24:39.639 --> 01:24:42.468
- I love you. Winnie.
I love you.

1721
01:24:45.515 --> 01:24:48.300
- Thank you. Thank you.

1722
01:24:48.474 --> 01:24:50.781
- So?
- So? So what?

1723
01:24:51.999 --> 01:24:53.218
- So let's go get her!

1724
01:24:54.698 --> 01:24:58.005
I mean. she loves you
and you love her.

1725
01:24:58.180 --> 01:25:00.007
Isn't this kind of obvious?
- Yeah. but--

1726
01:25:00.182 --> 01:25:01.183
- When a girl grand gestures.

1727
01:25:01.357 --> 01:25:02.880
the guy has to go on this big

1728
01:25:03.054 --> 01:25:04.186
dramatic chase
to reunite with her.

1729
01:25:05.491 --> 01:25:07.189
Everybody knows that!
- How do you even know this?

1730
01:25:07.363 --> 01:25:10.235
- You're wasting time!
Just grab your keys. let's go!

1731
01:25:10.409 --> 01:25:14.152
- Okay. Yeah. let's go!
- Hurry up!

1732
01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:18.548
- Winnie! Hi.

1733
01:25:19.070 --> 01:25:22.682
Uh. I don't know what that was
back there. but...

1734
01:25:24.728 --> 01:25:26.382
I should have listened
to you more.

1735
01:25:27.165 --> 01:25:28.906
I should have listened
to your ideas.

1736
01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:31.038
You're obviously
very passionate.

1737
01:25:32.562 --> 01:25:37.219
And I like to have
a certain amount of control
over my brand.

1738
01:25:37.393 --> 01:25:39.395
and maybe that can
hinder progress.

1739
01:25:40.700 --> 01:25:41.571
I apologize.

1740
01:25:42.354 --> 01:25:44.530
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1741
01:25:44.704 --> 01:25:49.448
- And I would love to help you
publish your next book.
Even fiction.

1742
01:25:50.623 --> 01:25:54.236
- Yeah. you know. I'm gonna
take some time away from Mush.

1743
01:25:54.410 --> 01:25:57.413
You know. just really give
this writing thing a try
on my own.

1744
01:25:58.718 --> 01:26:00.155
I quit.

1745
01:26:02.113 --> 01:26:04.420
Thank you. Inga.
You're the best.

1746
01:26:16.083 --> 01:26:17.346
[tense music]

1747
01:26:19.783 --> 01:26:21.176
- Winnie!

1748
01:26:23.221 --> 01:26:24.222
[panting]

1749
01:26:25.789 --> 01:26:27.834
- Did you guys just sprint here?

1750
01:26:28.008 --> 01:26:29.749
- That was the mother
of all grand gestures.

1751
01:26:31.055 --> 01:26:32.274
- It was. wasn't it?

1752
01:26:32.448 --> 01:26:33.971
- But your singing...

1753
01:26:34.145 --> 01:26:35.494
- That bad?

1754
01:26:35.668 --> 01:26:37.192
- Marginally better than mine.
but...

1755
01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:40.064
I read your column.

1756
01:26:41.108 --> 01:26:42.197
It wasn't all bad.

1757
01:26:43.502 --> 01:26:44.634
Some of it was actually
pretty nice.

1758
01:26:46.113 --> 01:26:47.463
- I should have told you.

1759
01:26:47.637 --> 01:26:49.639
Okay. I should have quit
a while ago but...

1760
01:26:50.292 --> 01:26:52.337
But I finally did today.

1761
01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:54.383
- I got rid of Dirk.

1762
01:26:55.122 --> 01:26:57.734
You were right. I was too
focused on money.

1763
01:27:00.998 --> 01:27:02.173
- Just kiss her!

1764
01:27:03.392 --> 01:27:05.089
[chuckling]

1765
01:27:14.098 --> 01:27:15.534
- Do you want to stand

1766
01:27:15.708 --> 01:27:17.884
in an absurdly long line
and get some ramen?

1767
01:27:18.058 --> 01:27:20.191
- Absolutely not.
- Yes!

1768
01:27:20.365 --> 01:27:22.324
- No! Never!
- Come on! Yes!

1769
01:27:22.498 --> 01:27:25.196
- I think we should go to--
- Ramen!

1770
01:27:25.370 --> 01:27:27.851
- ...one of the fine
restaurants that I sprinted
by in a blur.

1771
01:27:28.025 --> 01:27:29.853
- Come on. Ty.
- No lines.

1772
01:27:30.027 --> 01:27:31.768

01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:34.336
