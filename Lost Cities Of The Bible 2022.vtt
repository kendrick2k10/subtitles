00:09:21.867 --> 00:09:24.867
<i>because few have ever tried</i>
<i>to date these canals...</i>

157
00:09:26.267 --> 00:09:28.367
<i>...until now.</i>

158
00:09:28.367 --> 00:09:30.000
[Rey] <i>Our knowledge</i>
<i>of ancient Mesopotamia</i>

159
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:30.967
[Rey] <i>Our knowledge</i>
<i>of ancient Mesopotamia</i>

160
00:09:30.967 --> 00:09:31.000
is very limited.
and it dates back to

161
00:09:33.567 --> 00:09:35.100
<i>50. 60. 70 years.</i>

162
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.200
[narrator] <i>Sebastien's team</i>
<i>uses an ingenious technique</i>

163
00:09:41.267 --> 00:09:45.467
<i>to find out exactly how old</i>
<i>the canals are</i>

164
00:09:45.467 --> 00:09:50.067
<i>and if they were dug</i>
<i>at the same time</i>
<i>as the city was built.</i>

165
00:09:50.067 --> 00:09:55.167
The one way of dating
an ancient canal
is to collect shells

166
00:09:55.167 --> 00:09:57.700
from the bottom
of those canals.

167
00:09:57.767 --> 00:10:00.000
<i>We can radiocarbon date</i>
<i>the shells.</i>

168
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.767
<i>We can radiocarbon date</i>
<i>the shells.</i>

169
00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:01.000
<i>and this would date</i>
<i>the canal itself.</i>

170
00:10:03.867 --> 00:10:07.367
[narrator] <i>The team analyzes</i>
<i>more than 20 shells.</i>

171
00:10:07.367 --> 00:10:10.667
<i>The results reveal</i>
<i>a staggering surprise.</i>

172
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:16.567
[Rey] These are. um.
the first results we have
from the lab.

173
00:10:16.567 --> 00:10:19.800
The range of dates
for the earliest
largescale canal...

174
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.467
...is roughly from 6.000 BCE

175
00:10:24.467 --> 00:10:27.967
to 4.500 BCE.

176
00:10:27.967 --> 00:10:30.000
[narrator] <i>The canals appear</i>
<i>to predate any Sumerian city</i>

177
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000
[narrator] <i>The canals appear</i>
<i>to predate any Sumerian city</i>

178
00:10:31.867 --> 00:10:34.000
<i>by at least 1.000 years.</i>

179
00:10:36.767 --> 00:10:39.800
<i>It means that settled farming</i>
<i>cannot be the spark</i>

180
00:10:39.867 --> 00:10:42.167
<i>that led to places like Uruk.</i>

181
00:10:42.167 --> 00:10:48.000
So if we assume that the model
that everyone agrees on today

182
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.267
<i>that Uruk. the famous city</i>
<i>is the first city.</i>

183
00:10:51.267 --> 00:10:57.000
these canals are 1.000
to 2.000 years earlier

184
00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.067
<i>than this very important date.</i>

185
00:11:00.867 --> 00:11:01.000
This would significantly
change almost
everything we know

186
00:11:04.367 --> 00:11:07.800
about the rise of the city
in Mesopotamia.

187
00:11:10.167 --> 00:11:11.867

<i>we thought we knew</i>

188

189
00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:23.500
<i>Something else must have</i>

217
00:13:25.067 --> 00:13:27.767
[Sebastien Rey]
I'm holding in my hands
one of the most iconic objects

218
00:13:27.767 --> 00:13:30.100
of the site of Girsu Tello.

219
00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.067
This is a temple cone.

220
00:13:32.067 --> 00:13:34.167
But rather. we should
really call it a temple nail.

221
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.600
It was a symbolic object.

222
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:41.567
There's an inscription
incised on this object.

223
00:13:41.567 --> 00:13:41.701
The text always starts
with the name of Ningirsu.

224
00:13:41.701 --> 00:13:42.000
The text always starts
with the name of Ningirsu.

225
00:13:45.467 --> 00:13:48.667
[narrator] <i>Each Sumerian city</i>
<i>had its own deity.</i>

226
00:13:49.867 --> 00:13:54.067
<i>Girsu's patron god</i>

[Rey] When we found the cones
inserted in the walls.

234
00:14:17.067 --> 00:14:19.467
it was an exceptional moment.

235
00:14:19.467 --> 00:14:22.800
<i>We knew for a fact</i>
<i>that we had indeed discovered</i>

236

[narrator] <i>Legend says</i>
<i>that Ningirsu himself ordered</i>

238
00:14:32.467 --> 00:14:34.867
<i>the construction</i>
<i>of this building</i>

239
00:14:34.867 --> 00:14:37.500

<i>the king as an architect</i>
<i>holding a floor plan.</i>

243
00:14:48.167 --> 00:14:51.767
<i>At first. its geometry</i>
<i>baffled archaeologists.</i>

244
00:14:51.767 --> 00:14:55.867
<i>But Sebastien managed</i>
<i>to decode the measurements</i>
<i>inscribed on it.</i>

245
00:14:55.867 --> 00:15:01.100
<i>Incredibly. the dimensions</i>
<i>matched the building</i>
<i>in this trench perfectly.</i>

246
00:15:03.267 --> 00:15:06.867
<i>This floor plan is supposed</i>
<i>to be a divine blueprint.</i>

247
00:15:11.367 --> 00:15:11.701
<i>Sebastien thinks that</i>
<i>sacred shrines like this</i>

248
00:15:11.701 --> 00:15:12.000

249
00:15:17.367 --> 00:15:21.367
<i>Girsu's temple was built</i>
<i>just as the city</i>
<i>started to get going.</i>

250
00:15:23.167 --> 00:15:26.100
[Rey] <i>So a temple</i>
<i>in ancient Mesopotamia</i>
<i>was like a magnet.</i>

251
00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:30.100
It attracted people
worshipping the gods.

252
00:15:30.167 --> 00:15:34.867
<i>And the whole city</i>
<i>gravitated around</i>
<i>this important structure.</i>

[narrator] <i>Religion helped</i>
<i>to give rise</i>

00:15:38.367 --> 00:15:41.667
<i>to the civilization</i>
<i>that would shape the Bible.</i>

257
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.967

<i>had shrines.</i>

258

<i>How did the Sumerians</i>

259
00:15:54.367 --> 00:15:57.267
<i>A clue lies with a skill</i>
<i>we take for granted.</i>

260
00:15:59.767 --> 00:16:01.500
<i>Writing.</i>

261
00:16:02.767 --> 00:16:06.567
<i>Phil Jones investigates</i>
<i>how Sumerian priests</i>
<i>were the first people</i>

262

<i>to harness the true power</i>
<i>of this radical new idea.</i>

263
00:16:11.767 --> 00:16:12.000
Writing is probably one of
the three or four
most crucial inventions

264
00:16:16.467 --> 00:16:18.200
<i>in the whole of human history.</i>

265
00:16:19.267 --> 00:16:22.300
<i>It is a complete game changer.</i>

266
00:16:22.367 --> 00:16:26.667
[narrator] <i>The Sumerians</i>
<i>developed a system of writing</i>
<i>called cuneiform.</i>

267
00:16:26.667 --> 00:16:30.100
<i>A series of wedge-shaped</i>
<i>symbols made on wet clay.</i>

268
00:16:31.667 --> 00:16:34.067
<i>Some archaeologists think</i>
<i>writing was invented</i>

269
00:16:34.067 --> 00:16:36.700
<i>in the temple</i>
<i>as a method of book keeping.</i>

270
00:16:36.767 --> 00:16:41.400
This is a cuneiform tablet
just over 4.000 years old.

271
00:16:41.467 --> 00:16:41.701
So this is basically a receipt

272
00:16:41.701 --> 00:16:42.000
So this is basically a receipt

273
00:16:43.467 --> 00:16:47.100
for various uh. officials
receiving grain.

274
00:16:47.167 --> 00:16:50.100

276
00:16:53.467 --> 00:16:57.400
we have a total
of how much grain
has been involved.

277
00:16:57.467 --> 00:16:59.600
[narrator] <i>This carving</i>
<i>from Uruk reveals</i>

278
00:16:59.667 --> 00:17:03.267
<i>how temples had to administer</i>

<i>moving through the system.</i>

287
00:17:30.567 --> 00:17:33.867
The temple itself is partly
a religious institution.

288
00:17:33.867 --> 00:17:37.067
but it's also essentially
a real estate corporation.

289

<i>Legend says the gods</i>
<i>grew angry with humanity</i>
<i>for being too noisy.</i>

309
00:18:54.367 --> 00:18:57.667
<i>So they sent a great deluge</i>
<i>to wipe them out.</i>

310
00:18:58.567 --> 00:19:00.867
<i>But they spared one man</i>

311
00:19:00.867 --> 00:19:05.067
<i>who they told to build a boat</i>
<i>and rescue all life.</i>

312
00:19:05.067 --> 00:19:09.467
<i>Why is this Sumerian tale</i>
<i>so similar to the story</i>
<i>of Noah's Ark?</i>

313
00:19:10.567 --> 00:19:11.487
<i>Could a real event</i>

316
00:19:18.767 --> 00:19:25.067
<i>The most famous is found</i>
<i>in the tale of a king of Uruk</i>
<i>called Gilgamesh.</i>

317
00:19:25.067 --> 00:19:29.867
<i>The discovery of his story</i>

<i>brought up</i>
<i>on the tale of Noah.</i>

319
00:19:35.267 --> 00:19:39.667
<i>It appeared to confirm</i>
<i>that the Bible conveyed</i>
<i>historical truth.</i>

320
00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:42.000
<i>Gilgamesh was an epic hero.</i>
<i>but he may be based</i>

321
00:19:45.367 --> 00:19:50.100
<i>on a real king who lived</i>
<i>nearly 5.000 years ago.</i>

322

<i>So if he did exist.</i>
<i>what was the world</i>

323
00:19:53.567 --> 00:19:56.367
<i>the world of the flood?</i>

324
00:19:57.767 --> 00:20:01.000
<i>The rise of these early rulers</i>

327
00:20:07.567 --> 00:20:10.000
The big change
of the fourth millennium

328
00:20:10.067 --> 00:20:11.487
is that we see a new type
of leadership emerging.

329
00:20:11.487 --> 00:20:12.000
is that we see a new type
of leadership emerging.

330
00:20:13.867 --> 00:20:18.000
<i>There is a figure responsible</i>
<i>for forming the interface</i>

331
00:20:18.067 --> 00:20:20.900
<i>between the humans</i>
<i>and the deities.</i>

332

<i>of Uruk's temple...</i>

334
00:20:32.367 --> 00:20:35.700
<i>...a sign of his</i>
<i>sacred responsibilities.</i>

335
00:20:35.767 --> 00:20:40.467
<i>But as cities grew bigger.</i>
<i>they needed leaders</i>
<i>who could combine many roles.</i>

336
00:20:41.867 --> 00:20:42.000
[Barbara Helwing]
<i>We also see him</i>
<i>in scenes of violence.</i>

337
00:20:45.167 --> 00:20:49.367
This personality takes charge
of organizing these things.

338
00:20:49.367 --> 00:20:53.800
[narrator] <i>This was the world</i>
<i>that Gilgamesh would have</i>

341
00:21:04.167 --> 00:21:05.567

342
00:21:05.567 --> 00:21:09.100
that there are people
who are treated as slaves.

343
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.487

344

346
00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.567
<i>and it fascinates me.</i>

347
00:21:20.567 --> 00:21:23.900
<i>I would like to understand</i>
<i>how people ever</i>
<i>agreed to do this.</i>

348
00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:30.300
[narrator] <i>A curious</i>
<i>ancient text called</i>
<i>the Sumerian King List</i>

349
00:21:30.367 --> 00:21:33.300
<i>claims that Gilgamesh</i>
<i>was one of these early rulers.</i>

350

353
00:21:45.967 --> 00:21:47.100
<i>...but there's a problem.</i>

354
00:21:48.267 --> 00:21:50.667
<i>Historians think</i>

<i>But Assyriologist.</i>
<i>Stephanie Dalley</i>

358

359

360
00:22:12.067 --> 00:22:15.367
You need a flood
to give people the idea of it.

361
00:22:15.367 --> 00:22:18.067
and that's what you do get
in Mesopotamia.

[Stephanie Dalley]

458
00:28:30.567 --> 00:28:36.067
[narrator] <i>This astonishing</i>
<i>copper bowl reveals</i>
<i>the quality of Ur's textiles.</i>

459
00:28:36.067 --> 00:28:40.200
<i>Corrosion has preserved</i>
<i>details of the cloth</i>
<i>it was wrapped in.</i>

460
00:28:40.267 --> 00:28:44.700
[Hafford] And it preserved
the pattern of how tight
that weave is.

461
00:28:44.767 --> 00:28:46.567
and we can see a number
of these different things

462
00:28:46.567 --> 00:28:50.067
to get the range
of cloth types
that they were making.

463
00:28:50.067 --> 00:28:54.600
[narrator] <i>The artifacts</i>
<i>also hint at what the city</i>
<i>was getting in return.</i>

464
00:28:54.667 --> 00:28:57.100
<i>precious metals</i>
<i>from distant lands.</i>

465
00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:02.867
[Hafford] <i>We've got</i>
<i>carnelian coming in</i>
<i>from the Indus valley.</i>

466
00:29:02.867 --> 00:29:06.300
we've got copper
and diorite coming in
from Oman.

467
00:29:06.367 --> 00:29:10.100
and we've got lapis lazuli
and gold coming from Iran
and Afghanistan.

468
00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.667
<i>So long distance</i>
<i>trade networks</i>
<i>are very important</i>

469
00:29:14.667 --> 00:29:19.967
<i>because this is the way</i>
<i>you legitimize your kingship.</i>
<i>and you show your power.</i>

470
00:29:30.767 --> 00:29:33.200
[narrator] <i>So why did</i>
<i>the Biblical writers believe</i>

471
00:29:33.267 --> 00:29:36.667
<i>that their ancestor.</i>
<i>Abraham. was born here?</i>

472
00:29:37.867 --> 00:29:41.067
<i>A clue could lie with how</i>
<i>they describe this city.</i>

473
00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:46.667
<i>The book of Genesis</i>
<i>mentions Ur three times...</i>

474
00:29:47.767 --> 00:29:50.667
<i>...on each occasion</i>
<i>as Ur of the Chaldees.</i>

475
00:29:50.667 --> 00:29:55.467
<i>a people who ruled</i>
<i>southern Iraq</i>
<i>more than 1.000 years later...</i>

476
00:29:57.067 --> 00:29:58.133
<i>...when most scholars believe</i>
<i>the Bible was written down.</i>

477
00:29:58.133 --> 00:29:59.000
<i>...when most scholars believe</i>
<i>the Bible was written down.</i>

478
00:30:02.767 --> 00:30:08.567
<i>Ur still existed at this time</i>
<i>and was already more</i>
<i>than 2.000 years old.</i>

479
00:30:09.667 --> 00:30:12.167
<i>One explanation is that</i>
<i>the Biblical authors</i>

480
00:30:12.167 --> 00:30:15.100
<i>were trying to reconstruct</i>
<i>their distant past.</i>

481
00:30:18.067 --> 00:30:22.700
<i>But people of faith</i>
<i>believe that Abraham</i>
<i>really did live here.</i>

482
00:30:22.767 --> 00:30:25.900
<i>just hundreds of years</i>
<i>after Ur's golden age.</i>

483
00:30:27.267 --> 00:30:28.133
<i>This was a time of turmoil...</i>

484
00:30:28.133 --> 00:30:29.000
<i>This was a time of turmoil...</i>

485
00:30:30.267 --> 00:30:33.567
<i>...when invaders</i>
<i>devastated the city.</i>

486
00:30:33.567 --> 00:30:38.567
<i>It's also when</i>
<i>the first written copies</i>
<i>of the Flood myth appear.</i>

487
00:30:38.567 --> 00:30:43.767
<i>So could the collapse</i>
<i>of the Sumerian world</i>
<i>help explain both stories?</i>

488
00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:47.000
[narrator] <i>4.000 years ago.</i>

489
00:30:49.667 --> 00:30:53.100
<i>foreign enemies attacked</i>
<i>the great city of Ur.</i>

490
00:30:53.167 --> 00:30:55.467
<i>bringing its golden age</i>
<i>to a sudden end.</i>

491
00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:01.367
<i>Some believe one of the most</i>
<i>important events in the Bible</i>

492
00:31:01.367 --> 00:31:05.600
<i>took place during</i>
<i>the chaotic era that followed.</i>

493
00:31:05.667 --> 00:31:10.900
<i>Abraham. the ancestor</i>
<i>of the Israelites. left Ur</i>
<i>for the Promised Land.</i>

494
00:31:12.567 --> 00:31:15.067
<i>This is also the time</i>
<i>when the earliest written</i>

495
00:31:15.067 --> 00:31:16.211
<i>versions of the Flood myth</i>
<i>start to appear.</i>

496
00:31:16.211 --> 00:31:17.000
<i>versions of the Flood myth</i>
<i>start to appear.</i>

497
00:31:18.767 --> 00:31:20.700
<i>So did the fallout</i>
<i>from the collapse</i>

498
00:31:20.767 --> 00:31:24.700
<i>of this great city influence</i>
<i>the Old Testament stories?</i>

499

<i>Archaeologists uncovered it</i>
<i>in the early 20th century.</i>

501
00:31:37.067 --> 00:31:42.267
Well. the earliest
archaeologists in the near
and Middle East

502
00:31:42.267 --> 00:31:44.667
<i>were often driven</i>

<i>that Abraham</i>

506
00:31:50.167 --> 00:31:53.400
<i>However. he was gonna be</i>

<i>and find evidence.</i>

507
00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.900
<i>So. in a way.</i>
<i>they were trying to see</i>

508
00:31:57.967 --> 00:32:00.400
what was this city like
through so many
periods of time?

509
00:32:00.467 --> 00:32:02.567
<i>It was occupied</i>
<i>for 5.000 years.</i>

510
00:32:04.667 --> 00:32:08.267
[narrator] <i>The early</i>

<i>that Abraham would have</i>

512

<i>In his public works</i>

518
00:32:27.167 --> 00:32:31.100
he would often do it
to bring in the crowds.

519
00:32:31.167 --> 00:32:36.767
[narrator] <i>There's no physical</i>

529

535

554

The fall of
the Ur Three dynasty

555
00:34:31.967 --> 00:34:35.267
was a traumatic
experience for Sumer.

556
00:34:35.267 --> 00:34:38.700
<i>Basically it was the collapse</i>

557

<i>to be destroyed.</i>

563

<i>and even make into a satire.</i>

569
00:35:18.467 --> 00:35:23.267

<i>of the Flood story was how</i>
<i>humans could start again.</i>

570

573

There was a lot
of borrowing as well.

574
00:35:38.167 --> 00:35:40.100
There was a lot of
cross fertilization.

575

[narrator] <i>The Sumerian myths</i>

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:27.067
<i>But the Babylonians were aware</i>
<i>that they controlled cities</i>
<i>far older than their own.</i>

609
00:38:27.067 --> 00:38:31.767
<i>Assyriologist Stephanie Dalley</i>
<i>investigates how Babylon</i>

610
00:38:31.767 --> 00:38:36.067
<i>played a critical role</i>
<i>in keeping Sumerian</i>
<i>culture alive.</i>

611
00:38:36.067 --> 00:38:41.400
<i>The Babylonians inherited</i>
<i>writing from the Sumerians</i>
<i>and much more.</i>

612
00:38:41.467 --> 00:38:45.367
Babylon comes late
into the history
of Mesopotamia.

613
00:38:45.367 --> 00:38:49.277
There was a tremendous
amount of copying
Sumerian literature.

614
00:38:49.277 --> 00:38:50.000
There was a tremendous
amount of copying
Sumerian literature.

615
00:38:50.267 --> 00:38:53.500
<i>And Sumerian poetry is very</i>
<i>different from Babylonian.</i>

616
00:38:53.567 --> 00:38:55.800
<i>It's very imaginative.</i>

617
00:38:55.867 --> 00:38:58.467
<i>It was a major point for them</i>

618
00:38:58.467 --> 00:39:02.067
<i>to copy the poetry</i>
<i>of the Sumerians.</i>

619
00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:08.467
[narrator] <i>The Babylonians</i>
<i>set up writing schools</i>
<i>to teach cuneiform.</i>

620
00:39:08.467 --> 00:39:14.067
<i>Students learned by copying</i>
<i>from famous Sumerian stories</i>
<i>like the Flood myth.</i>

621
00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:19.277
Well the scribes had to master
the art of writing cuneiform
for a start.

622
00:39:19.277 --> 00:39:20.000
Well the scribes had to master
the art of writing cuneiform
for a start.

623
00:39:21.167 --> 00:39:23.567
So they practiced signs
and we've got lots

624
00:39:23.567 --> 00:39:27.467
of terribly. badly
written signs
from their exercises.

625
00:39:27.467 --> 00:39:30.067
<i>But then. they would take</i>
<i>a Sumerian poem</i>

626
00:39:30.067 --> 00:39:34.167
<i>or they would take</i>
<i>a short story about Gilgamesh.</i>

627
00:39:34.167 --> 00:39:38.367
They would get to know it
like we would learn
a piece of Shakespeare.

628
00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:42.167
[narrator] <i>The scale</i>
<i>of the copying was immense.</i>

629
00:39:43.167 --> 00:39:47.100
<i>But only selected</i>
<i>stories survive.</i>

630
00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:49.277
Some people think that
all the literature we've got
is on school exercises.

631
00:39:49.277 --> 00:39:50.000
Some people think that
all the literature we've got
is on school exercises.

632
00:39:52.367 --> 00:39:55.567
and we certainly find a lot
of them that are
not very well written

633
00:39:55.567 --> 00:39:58.467
and got quite a lot
of mistakes in them.

634
00:39:58.467 --> 00:40:04.800
One of the things about
he Flood story is that
we have got more extracts

635
00:40:04.867 --> 00:40:09.600
of Tablet XI than we have
of any other bits
of the Gilgamesh epic

636
00:40:09.667 --> 00:40:12.267
<i>which is marvelous.</i>
<i>but infuriating</i>

637
00:40:12.267 --> 00:40:15.067
<i>because we still got gaps</i>
<i>where we haven't got anything.</i>

638
00:40:17.267 --> 00:40:19.277
[narrator] <i>Babylon owed</i>
<i>a rich debt</i>
<i>to Sumerian culture.</i>

639
00:40:19.277 --> 00:40:20.000
[narrator] <i>Babylon owed</i>
<i>a rich debt</i>
<i>to Sumerian culture.</i>

640
00:40:21.567 --> 00:40:26.367
<i>And in turn. it brought</i>
<i>their tales to a new audience.</i>

641
00:40:26.367 --> 00:40:33.167
<i>In 589 BC. the Babylonian king</i>
<i>Nebuchadnezzar II</i>
<i>conquered Jerusalem</i>

642
00:40:33.167 --> 00:40:36.267
<i>and deported</i>
<i>many of its citizens.</i>

643
00:40:36.267 --> 00:40:40.000
<i>Many scholars think</i>
<i>the Book of Genesis</i>
<i>was written in Babylon</i>

644
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.667
<i>by Jewish exiles.</i>

645
00:40:43.267 --> 00:40:46.500
<i>Here they came into contact</i>
<i>with Sumerian stories</i>

646
00:40:46.567 --> 00:40:48.667
<i>that were thousands</i>
<i>of years old.</i>

647
00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:52.667
<i>But for the Biblical authors.</i>

648
00:40:52.667 --> 00:40:58.067
<i>these stories</i>
<i>of gods and monsters</i>
<i>took on a new dimension.</i>

649
00:40:58.067 --> 00:41:02.067
<i>They revealed the truth</i>
<i>about human existence</i>
<i>as they saw it.</i>

650
00:41:03.067 --> 00:41:07.367
<i>As the divine plan</i>
<i>of a single God.</i>

651
00:41:07.367 --> 00:41:11.067
<i>The Jewish scribes were trying</i>
<i>to reconstruct their history</i>

652
00:41:11.067 --> 00:41:15.800
<i>much like Sumerians had done</i>
<i>thousands of years earlier</i>
<i>with the Flood.</i>

653
00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:19.277
The Sumerians are
our common ancestor.

654
00:41:19.277 --> 00:41:20.000
The Sumerians are
our common ancestor.

655
00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.100
<i>We owe them so much.</i>

656
00:41:25.167 --> 00:41:28.200
[narrator] <i>The tales</i>
<i>of the Old Testament</i>
<i>remember the legacy</i>

657
00:41:28.267 --> 00:41:33.067
<i>of an ancient</i>
<i>and remarkable people:</i>
<i>the Sumerians.</i>

658
00:41:33.067 --> 00:41:35.467
<i>They constructed</i>
<i>extraordinary wonders</i>

659
00:41:35.567 --> 00:41:37.867
<i>that have survived</i>
<i>the test of time.</i>

660
00:41:38.667 --> 00:41:41.767
<i>invented writing</i>
<i>and literature</i>

661
00:41:41.767 --> 00:41:45.467
<i>and pioneered</i>
<i>a new urban life.</i>

662
00:41:45.467 --> 00:41:49.277
<i>In many ways. the story</i>
<i>of Iraq's lost cities</i>
<i>is Genesis.</i>

663
00:41:49.277 --> 00:41:50.000
<i>In many ways. the story</i>
<i>of Iraq's lost cities</i>
<i>is Genesis.</i>

664
00:41:51.467 --> 00:41:53.967
<i>The history of our beginnings.</i>

665
00:41:53.967 --> 00:41:56.667
