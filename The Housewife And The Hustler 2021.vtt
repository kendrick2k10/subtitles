00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:14.919
and then eventually
made her way to L. A.

171
00:09:14.919 --> 00:09:19.019
and was a waitress
and met a very wealthy.

172
00:09:19.019 --> 00:09:21.089
much older man
that she connected with.

173
00:09:21.089 --> 00:09:26.189
And I mean.
that ́s kind of the L. A. dream.

174
00:09:26.189 --> 00:09:30.019
‐They got married very off the
cuff at a country club.

175
00:09:30.019 --> 00:09:34.049
‐As the story goes.
Tom Girardi asked the judge

176
00:09:34.049 --> 00:09:37.889
if a judge would officiate over
a marriage ceremony with Erika.

177
00:09:37.889 --> 00:09:40.719
They pulled an attorney
from the bar as a witness.

178
00:09:40.719 --> 00:09:43.919
They got married on the spot
and there was no prenup.

179
00:09:43.919 --> 00:09:52.919
♫♫

180
00:09:52.919 --> 00:09:55.789
‐Tom had a law firm.
Girardi Keese.

181
00:09:55.789 --> 00:09:59.819
The pay was good.
but the perks were great.

182
00:10:01.849 --> 00:10:05.149
‐It was just extra.

183
00:10:05.149 --> 00:10:07.489
It was normal
to stay at the Ritz‐Carlton.

184
00:10:07.489 --> 00:10:10.749
The Christmas party
was at The Jonathan Club.

185
00:10:10.749 --> 00:10:13.289
Every year you have someone
like LeAnn Rimes

00:10:24.689 --> 00:10:27.719
‐There ́s an annual conference
in Las Vegas.

192
00:10:27.719 --> 00:10:30.619
He would host a dinner. and that
was the hottest ticket in town.

193
00:10:30.619 --> 00:10:33.889
‐There was Jay Leno performing.

194
00:10:33.889 --> 00:10:36.949
Erin Brockovich

195
00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:38.849
‐I remember one time
I was with Tom

196
00:10:38.849 --> 00:10:42.789
and he actually points
to a judge across the room

197
00:10:42.789 --> 00:10:45.219
and actually goes like this.

198
00:10:45.219 --> 00:10:48.249
And this judge ran up to him
like a puppy dog.

199
00:10:48.249 --> 00:10:51.949
I saw the power that he could
wield right then and there.

200
00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:56.049
‐He was the man that people went
to who wanted to get appointed

201
00:10:56.049 --> 00:10:58.249
to the bench and become judges.

202
00:10:58.249 --> 00:11:01.189
He was the person that people
who wanted to run

203
00:11:01.189 --> 00:11:04.849
for public office
would go and meet and talk to.

204
00:11:04.849 --> 00:11:08.289
‐You have some ties
to Erika Jayne.

205
00:11:08.289 --> 00:11:09.689
‐That ́s right.
‐Right?

206
00:11:09.689 --> 00:11:11.719
‐Well. I mean. indirect ties
in political ties.

207
00:11:11.719 --> 00:11:12.989
‐Right.
‐Because her husband ́s

208
00:11:12.989 --> 00:11:15.889
one of the major donors
in California politics.

209
00:11:15.889 --> 00:11:17.919
‐Wow.
And does he give to you?

210
00:11:17.919 --> 00:11:19.449
‐He has been
extraordinarily generous to me.

211
00:11:19.449 --> 00:11:21.719
‐Nice!
‐So she is my favorite

212
00:11:21.719 --> 00:11:22.949
"Real Housewife."

213
00:11:25.249 --> 00:11:28.489
‐So Erika Girardi.

00:11:46.119 --> 00:11:48.719
‐I think he kind of loved
that he had this very sexy.

00:11:48.719 --> 00:11:51.749
young. burgeoning pop star wife.

222
00:11:51.749 --> 00:11:56.319
He put a lot of money. you know.
into making her Erika Jayne.

223
00:11:58.849 --> 00:12:01.319
‐I mean. the titles of her songs
and stuff are now

224
00:12:01.319 --> 00:12:04.789
just like.
"It ́s Expensive to Be Me"

225
00:12:04.789 --> 00:12:08.219

♫ Done ♫

229
00:12:14.049 --> 00:12:17.189
‐Erica says there was no return
on investments.

230
00:12:17.189 --> 00:12:19.219
So Tom Girardi was probably

231
00:12:19.219 --> 00:12:21.919
going to have her throw
in the towel.

232
00:12:21.919 --> 00:12:25.419
but then all of a sudden
she gets cast on

233
00:12:25.419 --> 00:12:28.549
"The Real Housewives
of Beverly Hills."

234
00:12:28.549 --> 00:12:31.819
‐I ́m an enigma wrapped in
a riddle and cash.

235
00:12:31.819 --> 00:12:33.749
‐She was very good casting.

236
00:12:33.749 --> 00:12:35.619
She was probably the best
since me.

237
00:12:35.619 --> 00:12:38.689
‐Being broke sucks and being
rich is a lot better.

238
00:12:38.689 --> 00:12:41.449
‐They wanted girls that could
get in there and entertain.

239
00:12:41.449 --> 00:12:44.049
but yet hold their own.
‐The wealth that we get to see

240
00:12:44.049 --> 00:12:46.149
Erika Girardi have on the show

241
00:12:46.149 --> 00:12:49.849
is almost difficult
to wrap your brain around.

242
00:12:49.849 --> 00:12:51.949
‐She leveled up
the whole "Housewife" game

243
00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:54.149
when she got on "Beverly Hills."

244
00:12:54.149 --> 00:13:03.049

‐Oh. my God.
‐It ́s kind of a mess.

But you can come in here.
‐Oh. my God.

I didn ́t know that you
could attain that much wealth

by being a trial attorney.

258
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:43.889
‐So this is supposed to be
reality. "reality" television.

259
00:13:43.889 --> 00:13:46.249
but is it really a reality?

260
00:13:46.249 --> 00:13:50.319
Are we really seeing

‐Erika!
‐Erika!

262
00:13:51.749 --> 00:13:55.089
‐And this facade starts
crumbling

00:13:55.089 --> 00:13:58.589
when Erika Jayne files
for divorce in 2020.

264
00:13:58.589 --> 00:14:02.389

267
00:14:19.049 --> 00:14:20.649
‐There is a huge amount
of pressure

268
00:14:20.649 --> 00:14:22.649
to maintain the lifestyle

269
00:14:22.649 --> 00:14:24.449

for example. you know.

273
00:14:30.689 --> 00:14:33.149
I might be
launching like a shoe line

274
00:14:33.149 --> 00:14:35.449
and I was going to do
a $10.000 party.

‐The ladies ladies.
ladies I use loosely.

283
00:15:04.419 --> 00:15:08.489
They had a tendency to always

want well beyond their means.

285
00:15:10.519 --> 00:15:12.749
‐There ́s a duality that will
take place on this show

286
00:15:12.749 --> 00:15:15.619
because at one hand
it is aspirational.

287
00:15:15.619 --> 00:15:17.889
or it feels to be aspirational.

288
00:15:17.889 --> 00:15:19.589
but on the other hand.
you see that wealth does

289
00:15:19.589 --> 00:15:21.589
not solve. really.
any of these women ́s problems.

290
00:15:27.589 --> 00:15:30.119
There is a specific category
of housewives

291
00:15:30.119 --> 00:15:36.519
that fall into this echelon of
"housewives with legal issues."

292
00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:38.789
‐Real trouble.
‐The charges she ́s facing

293

‐Appearing to serve a 15 month

a patron saint of this category

with her husband
and went to jail.

298
00:15:52.749 --> 00:15:56.389

is every time one of these women

of legal situation.

305
00:16:20.419 --> 00:16:22.419
the first thing that all of us
think is.

306
00:16:22.419 --> 00:16:26.419
"My God. I hope the cameras

‐No.
‐No. Oh. my gosh.

310
00:16:31.619 --> 00:16:33.389
‐But nobody gets used to it.

311

‐I ́m always asking
this one for advice.

312
00:16:35.489 --> 00:16:37.689
I ́m always asking this one.
"What should I do?"

313

How do I handle it?
What what? What do I do?

314
00:16:40.419 --> 00:16:45.289
And that ́s. you know. that ́s the
truth. This is my leader.

315
00:16:45.289 --> 00:16:48.889
‐How do you like being on camera
for "Real Housewives"?

316
00:16:48.889 --> 00:16:51.919
‐I prefer to be
in a courtroom someplace.

317
00:16:51.919 --> 00:16:54.189
‐There you go.

318
00:16:54.189 --> 00:16:56.019
‐I recall watching
a couple episodes

319
00:16:56.019 --> 00:16:57.219
and I just shook my head

320
00:16:57.219 --> 00:17:01.689
because there was talk in there
about Tom ́s age.

321
00:17:01.689 --> 00:17:03.189
There was talk in there.
I believe.

322
00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:05.719
about his sexual prowess
at his age.

323
00:17:05.719 --> 00:17:08.919
‐And what ́s he like
in the sack?

324
00:17:08.919 --> 00:17:12.919
‐My wife turned to it one day.
some months ago.

"Don ́t you know him?"

Surprise to see him there.

330
00:17:24.449 --> 00:17:27.549
‐Here ́s a painting
by Marc Chagall.

331
00:17:27.549 --> 00:17:30.089
‐Chagall is one
of Tom ́s favorite painters.

332
00:17:30.089 --> 00:17:31.549
‐Is this it?

333
00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:34.219
‐And his paintings can go for
over a million dollars easily.

334
00:17:34.219 --> 00:17:36.719
‐Oh. wow.
Tom. this is Beautiful.

335
00:17:36.719 --> 00:17:39.819
‐Probably most appalling

00:27:30.049 --> 00:27:32.289
‐So once I actually got to know
Tom a little bit.

505
00:27:32.289 --> 00:27:34.519
he would take me out to dinner.

506
00:27:34.519 --> 00:27:36.289
He was not
a very big guy physically.

507
00:27:36.289 --> 00:27:40.689
It ́s probably like 5 ́5"
maybe at the tallest.

508
00:27:40.689 --> 00:27:43.119
But he just exuded confidence
and charm.

509
00:27:43.119 --> 00:27:44.719
He was always talking
about Erika.

510
00:27:44.719 --> 00:27:46.089
"Oh. she ́s the sweetest thing."

511
00:27:46.089 --> 00:27:47.889
"Look at you like this tie
I ́m wearing. Joe?

512
00:27:47.889 --> 00:27:50.949
She picked it out. Yeah. she ́s
really good at style."

513
00:27:50.949 --> 00:27:54.789
And. "Oh. look at this music
video that I did for her."

514
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:56.419
He ́s fought these
big battles before

515
00:27:56.419 --> 00:27:58.349
and has gotten
large settlements.

516
00:27:58.349 --> 00:28:01.249
So I ́m like. this seems like
the perfect guy for the job.

518
00:28:06.419 --> 00:28:09.789
‐They found out
it was a faulty pipe.

519
00:28:09.789 --> 00:28:13.589
Basically was negligence
on their part.

520
00:28:13.589 --> 00:28:14.949
He never really gave us details

521
00:28:14.949 --> 00:28:17.289
about what he was doing
in the case.

522
00:28:17.289 --> 00:28:20.719
but I still thought
he was really. really great.

523
00:28:20.719 --> 00:28:22.649
It just seemed like he was
trying to be very friendly

524
00:28:22.649 --> 00:28:24.219
and letting us know
that he was there for us.

525
00:28:24.219 --> 00:28:26.549
gave us his cell phone.
home phone.

526
00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:29.089
we had went to mediation
and he. you know.

527
00:28:29.089 --> 00:28:30.919
made it sound like
we were going to go to trial.

528
00:28:30.919 --> 00:28:32.889
And when we walked in.
he was like.

529
00:28:32.889 --> 00:28:34.419
"I settled your case."

530
00:28:34.419 --> 00:28:37.749
It was like.
"Oh. okay. you did?"

531
00:28:37.749 --> 00:28:40.189
‐You know. I didn ́t feel like
they really had a grasp

532
00:28:40.189 --> 00:28:41.749
on what happened that day.

533
00:28:41.749 --> 00:28:46.819
And I knew part of it is you ́re
stunned in a situation like that

534
00:28:46.819 --> 00:28:48.789
and you ́re just
not absorbing it.

535
00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:51.589
‐They were just throwing numbers
out like. you know.

536
00:28:51.589 --> 00:28:53.249
he could get this much a month.

537
00:28:53.249 --> 00:28:54.449
He ́s going to. you know.

538
00:28:54.449 --> 00:28:56.519
have payments
throughout his life.

539
00:28:56.519 --> 00:28:58.489
‐A number of the settlement
that Tom got.

540
00:28:58.489 --> 00:29:00.589
Yeah. I was okay with that
number. Yeah.

541
00:29:00.589 --> 00:29:04.189
To put it simply. it was. it was
yeah. It was a good amount.

542
00:29:04.189 --> 00:29:06.789
It was a good amount
and made me feel comfortable.

543
00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:08.449
So it made me feel like

544
00:29:08.449 --> 00:29:12.189
it would be able to cover any
issues in life and then some.

545
00:29:12.189 --> 00:29:15.089
‐After a trial or it can be
just a settlement.

546
00:29:15.089 --> 00:29:17.889
the money goes into
your trust account.

547
00:29:17.889 --> 00:29:19.449
‐Those funds need to be held

548
00:29:19.449 --> 00:29:22.219
in that trust account.
separate and apart

549
00:29:22.219 --> 00:29:26.089
from the law firm.
Now. at that point in time.

550
00:29:26.089 --> 00:29:27.619
you ́re entitled
to your legal fees.

551
00:29:27.619 --> 00:29:30.449
but the rest of the money
belongs to the client.

552
00:29:30.449 --> 00:29:33.419
You ́re not allowed to touch that
money. it ́s not your money.

553
00:29:33.419 --> 00:29:38.449
‐To remove those funds
for any reason before it ́s clear

554
00:29:38.449 --> 00:29:42.719
that there ́s a proper accounting
of what the client should get.

555
00:29:42.719 --> 00:29:47.949
that is probably one of the most
serious offenses by attorneys.

556
00:29:47.949 --> 00:29:51.649
certainly in California.
And I would think nationwide.

557
00:29:51.649 --> 00:29:55.019
every single lawyer knows
that if you dip

558
00:29:55.019 --> 00:29:59.549
into the client ́s account.
you will be disbarred.

♫♫

560
00:30:03.019 --> 00:30:05.019
‐So he said it would take about
three months

561
00:30:05.019 --> 00:30:08.219
to process getting the money
from PG&E and then asked

562
00:30:08.219 --> 00:30:11.919
if we ́d like to keep my
daughter ́s money and our money

563
00:30:11.919 --> 00:30:14.289
and then my son ́s big settlement

564
00:30:14.289 --> 00:30:16.719
in something
that he ́d invested in.

565
00:30:16.719 --> 00:30:21.489
‐He suggested that he would take
their millions of dollars

566
00:30:21.489 --> 00:30:22.849
of settlement funds

567
00:30:22.849 --> 00:30:27.789
and put that money
into some kind of an account

568
00:30:27.789 --> 00:30:33.219
that would guarantee
six percent interest.

569
00:30:33.219 --> 00:30:35.189
‐And he ́s supposedly
a millionaire.

570
00:30:35.189 --> 00:30:37.749
I thought he knew
how to deal with money.

571
00:30:37.749 --> 00:30:41.049
Obviously. he was. you know.
so he made it sound

572
00:30:41.049 --> 00:30:43.389
like it was a great thing to do.

573
00:30:43.389 --> 00:30:44.589
And then after everything
was paid.

574
00:30:44.589 --> 00:30:47.849
he would send us.
you know. our balance.

575
00:30:47.849 --> 00:30:50.289
So we were like. OK. you know.
that sounds good.

576
00:30:50.289 --> 00:30:54.349
And so that ́s what we did.

577
00:30:54.349 --> 00:30:58.749
‐So in the very beginning
and after it settled in 2013.

578
00:30:58.749 --> 00:31:02.889
I mean. it didn ́t feel like
things made sense right away.

579
00:31:02.889 --> 00:31:08.949
‐The amounts of the investment.
he claimed. were not accurate.

580
00:31:08.949 --> 00:31:12.519
He never sent any statements
of any kind.

581
00:31:12.519 --> 00:31:15.289
‐I mean. it was as simple as me
noticing. like. okay.

582
00:31:15.289 --> 00:31:19.149
I ́m expected to get a payment
this day and I didn ́t get it.

583
00:31:19.149 --> 00:31:20.589
So I would call him.

584
00:31:20.589 --> 00:31:23.589
And. you know. if he was hard
to get a hold of. would be like.

585
00:31:23.589 --> 00:31:26.149
"Oh. yeah. sorry about that.
́These things happen. ́

586
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:27.989
I ́ll get it to you next week."

587
00:31:27.989 --> 00:31:32.089
And half the time the check
would come when he ́d say so

588
00:31:32.089 --> 00:31:34.389
the second time
and other times it wouldn ́t.

589
00:31:56.689 --> 00:31:59.549
‐That was the three months
after we settled.

590
00:31:59.549 --> 00:32:01.689
That was the first time we were
supposed to meet with him.

591
00:32:01.689 --> 00:32:03.749
where he was supposed
to bring our money.

592
00:32:03.749 --> 00:32:06.949
That ́s when he met with us and

593
00:32:06.949 --> 00:32:10.819
and then basically offered us
the investment deal.

594
00:32:28.149 --> 00:32:30.949
‐When I hear the voicemails.
it makes me sick to my stomach

595
00:32:30.949 --> 00:32:33.989
because I know
that it was just all a lie.

596
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:39.989
Me and Kathy were on the phone
every day for hours

597
00:32:39.989 --> 00:32:41.419
trying to sort things out.

598
00:32:41.419 --> 00:32:44.649
Viciously Googling things.

you know. my experience

00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:52.319
And we ́re trying
to figure it out.

602
00:32:52.319 --> 00:32:54.789
‐You know. I would be coming
home from wherever

603
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:58.889
and my mom would be like buried
in paperwork or talking to Kim

604
00:32:58.889 --> 00:33:02.849
on the phone and she had
connects on the inside.

605
00:33:02.849 --> 00:33:05.689
‐There were times that we were
pretty scared

606
00:33:05.689 --> 00:33:11.019

00:33:31.819 --> 00:33:36.049
And I am a former client
of Tom Girardi.

614
00:33:39.249 --> 00:33:47.089
In 2010. I seeked out a doctor.
I have three kids.

615
00:33:47.089 --> 00:33:50.249
and as most women do
when they have kids.

616
00:33:50.249 --> 00:33:52.319
they have incontinence issues.

617
00:33:52.319 --> 00:33:54.749
So I talked to
my doctor about it.

618
00:33:54.749 --> 00:33:57.189
He said. "Oh. now we have this
sling. We ́re going to ‐‐

Did the procedure. didn ́t work.

Started feeling sick.
I went back to the doctor.

622
00:34:10.819 --> 00:34:13.649
He says. "Okay.

623
00:34:15.749 --> 00:34:18.049

So I went to

I signed up with them in 2014.

629

During the time that I was

630
00:34:49.719 --> 00:34:56.219
changed hands various times.
which I thought was strange.

631
00:34:56.219 --> 00:34:59.749
I thought. "Okay. why are
these attorneys leaving?"

632
00:34:59.749 --> 00:35:01.589
It was just a big turnover.

That was. that

00:47:26.849 --> 00:47:30.419
there were these lenders who
were suing Tom very publicly.

837
00:47:30.419 --> 00:47:33.989
‐He had taken out tens
of millions of dollars in loans

838
00:47:33.989 --> 00:47:36.419
and he wasn ́t
paying them back properly.

839
00:47:36.419 --> 00:47:41.949
‐Why would Tom. who has won
hundreds of millions of dollars

840
00:47:41.949 --> 00:47:44.989
in settlements and verdicts.
need to to borrow money?

841
00:47:44.989 --> 00:47:47.449
‐The easiest way for people
to basically understand this

842
00:47:47.449 --> 00:47:50.119
is that just like
any business might go out

843
00:47:50.119 --> 00:47:51.389
and secure a loan

844
00:47:51.389 --> 00:47:55.149
in order to run
or operate their business.

845
00:47:55.149 --> 00:47:56.749
lawyers will do the same thing.

846
00:47:56.749 --> 00:47:59.149
But sometimes people do it
because they ́re in trouble.

847
00:47:59.149 --> 00:48:02.649
And apparently these were
the types of loans

848
00:48:02.649 --> 00:48:10.419
that were coming due
for Girardi before the divorce.

849
00:48:10.419 --> 00:48:15.389
‐So after a couple of the
lenders had filed lawsuits

850
00:48:15.389 --> 00:48:16.619
against Tom.
I mean.

851
00:48:16.619 --> 00:48:19.919
we knew that we had
to get out of there.

852
00:48:19.919 --> 00:48:22.849
We couldn ́t wait for Paul ́s case
to be done anymore.

853
00:48:22.849 --> 00:48:27.919
We had ‐‐ Paul is dead.
Joe is still alive.

854
00:48:27.919 --> 00:48:32.489
So we had to pick Joe.
He had to be the priority again

855
00:48:32.489 --> 00:48:37.689
because he ́s the one still here.
you know?

856
00:48:37.689 --> 00:48:41.989
And so me and Kathy
scooped up our stuff and left.

857
00:48:41.989 --> 00:48:44.889
And. you know.
luckily we found an attorney

858
00:48:44.889 --> 00:48:46.619
who could help them and help me.

859
00:48:46.619 --> 00:48:55.619
♫♫

860
00:48:55.619 --> 00:48:57.189
‐He signed an agreement

861
00:48:57.189 --> 00:49:00.249
that he would make
a million dollar payment

862
00:49:00.249 --> 00:49:02.449
and then like
a couple months later.

863
00:49:02.449 --> 00:49:05.219
it was like a two and
a half million dollar payment.

864
00:49:05.219 --> 00:49:07.419
But he never got
to the second payment.

865
00:49:07.419 --> 00:49:10.349
‐It ́s very disappointing
when you find out your lawyer

866
00:49:10.349 --> 00:49:11.689
basically robbed you.

867
00:49:11.689 --> 00:49:14.049
knowing that he knows everything
that I ́ve been through.

868
00:49:14.049 --> 00:49:15.649
I just don ́t get it.

869
00:49:17.819 --> 00:49:19.489
‐So they dragged him
back into court.

870
00:49:19.489 --> 00:49:22.249
turned this settlement
into an actual judgment

871
00:49:22.249 --> 00:49:25.689
that ́s enforceable
and then they deposed him.

872
00:49:43.519 --> 00:49:46.589
‐You don ́t see
depositions this alarming.

873
00:50:11.289 --> 00:50:14.419
‐It ́s like.
wow. like broke?

874
00:50:14.419 --> 00:50:16.449
Like broke. broke?

875
00:50:16.449 --> 00:50:19.789
Like but not
the client ́s money. right?

876
00:50:19.789 --> 00:50:23.119
‐I was like. "Oh crap.
he admits it."

877
00:50:23.119 --> 00:50:24.519
This is his own words.

878
00:50:24.519 --> 00:50:28.349
He had $50 or $80 million.
he says.

879
00:50:28.349 --> 00:50:32.989
And now. you know.
there ́s nothing left.

880
00:50:32.989 --> 00:50:36.249
‐So the first question
that comes to my mind is

881
00:50:36.249 --> 00:50:38.119
where did it go?

882
00:50:38.119 --> 00:50:40.049
Where ́s the money?

883
00:50:40.049 --> 00:50:44.249
And that admission that he
is broke. he has no money.

884
00:50:44.249 --> 00:50:48.049
opens up the door
to Erika ́s finances.

where the rumors
started to escalate.

888
00:51:15.449 --> 00:51:19.389
it was a very slow. it ́s almost

We saw one case and then another
and then another.

892
00:51:28.049 --> 00:51:31.319
We saw this flurry of activity
that had been going on

893
00:51:31.319 --> 00:51:35.889
very quietly
over the last several years.

894
00:51:35.889 --> 00:51:39.149
That was really where we started
just trying to map out

895
00:51:39.149 --> 00:51:40.749
what exactly was happening.

896
00:51:40.749 --> 00:51:44.019
It was just very unusual to have
all of that happening at once.

897
00:51:53.949 --> 00:51:57.419
‐In December. 2020.
a Chicago lawyer

several of his clients
hadn ́t been paid.

901
00:52:06.149 --> 00:52:11.019
And now this whole thing blows
up because now it ́s public.

902
00:52:11.019 --> 00:52:14.849
‐The Chicago case was
groundbreaking in the sense

903
00:52:14.849 --> 00:52:17.619
that it finally brought out
in the public eye

904
00:52:17.619 --> 00:52:19.349
to all the media outlets

905
00:52:19.349 --> 00:52:23.149
that Tom Girardi
potentially was a fraud.

906
00:52:23.149 --> 00:52:28.119
‐This was the Lion Air crash the
737 MAX crashed in Indonesia.

In 2018. I was
involved in that litigation.

908

I represented families

who had lost
loved ones on that crash.

910
00:52:38.289 --> 00:52:41.149
We were all in the process
of working with Boeing

912
00:52:44.819 --> 00:52:48.619

00:53:29.649 --> 00:53:32.749
