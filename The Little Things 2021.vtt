1
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
without wheels

2
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
but the love we feel

3
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
the wilderness

4
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.000
the trip begins with a kiss

5
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
but the love we feel

6
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
No. no. no. Hello! Hello!

7
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Somebody!

8
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
No. please. no. no. please!
No. no. no. please!

9
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Please. please. please!

10
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Please. please. please!

11
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Please. Oh. God.

12
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Please. please.
please. help me!

13
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
the wilderness

14
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000
-

15
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
-Yeah. it's blood.
- Good.

16
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
I hope they bleed to death.

17
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
It's the third time
in two months.

18
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
There are 47 bulbs
in the letter "G."

19
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
It's $3.10 a pop.

20
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
That's $145.70. every time.

21
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
That's an additional 13 dinners
I gotta sell just to float.

22
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Are you listening to me?

23
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Yes. sir.

24
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Half our take is
from the interstate.

25
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
You drive by. you look up...

26
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Not exactly
a Happy Meal.

27
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Morning. Deke.

28
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Hey. Deke.

29
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Yes. sir.

30
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
You remember a punk named
JJ Kendricks?

31
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Robbed the Quick Mart?

32
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
We've got a witness
who ID'd him. but she's

33
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
All she knows for certain is
that he was wearing a really

34
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Fancy stitching.

35
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
"Unforgettable." she says.

36
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
But Kendricks is a suspect
in a robbery down in LA.

37
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Down in LA?

38
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
-Yeah.
-Is this headed somewhere?

39
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Yeah. And so are you.

40
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
There's a prelim
day after tomorrow

41
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
You drive to LA and bring back
the bloodstained boots.

42
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
she ID's them.
and the judge

43
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
The blood. they definitely
ran the ABO on the blood?

44
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
That's correct.

45
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Then that means
this is a DA problem. Captain.

46
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Oh. no. it's our problem.

47
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
No evidence. no conviction.

48
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
I got nobody else.

49
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Yes. sir.

50
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Don't look at me like that.
You the one been gone

51
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Ah...

52
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
I'll see you tonight.

53
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
I'm. uh. here to pick up
seized evidence.

54
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Property said it was here.

55
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Yeah.

56
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Excuse you.

57
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Evidence is here. but it's not
leaving without a signature.

58
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
-Ah.
-Uh-uh. Not yours.

59
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
I need authorization
from Homicide to release.

60
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
-There's
a preliminary tomorrow.

61
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Captain Farris put a lock on
this item for testing.

62
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
-It's already been tested.
-Don't I know it.

63
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
He wants it re-tested.
Become a thing.

64
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
So I hear.

65
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Hey. look. You get me
a signature and. uh.

66
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
wearing the damn things
for all I care.

67
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
-

68
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Hey. Hey.

69
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
This yours?

70
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
-Yeah. unhook it.
-You blocked me in.

71
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Why didn't you just
ask me to move it?

72
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000
'Cause I don't have time.
You want special treatment?

73
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Go back to Kern County.

74
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Unhook it.

75
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
...all-hands-on-deck
approach to this case.

76
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
To these cases.

77
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Our city. our communities.
our citizens.

78
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
and above all else...

79
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
these innocent victims
deserve no less.

80
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
I don't know how many
times I need to tell you. man.

81
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Take it out of the file.
Please.

82
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000
...is that we're asking
for your help.

83
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
If anyone has seen
or heard from anyone

84
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
that might somehow
be related to these cases...

85
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Carl.

86
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
I see Brother Love's...

87
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
salvation show's
still in operation.

88
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Everybody needs a little faith.
Even you.

89
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Got yourself a new disciple.

90
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Great detective.
great guy.

91
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
You should listen in.
you might learn something

92
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
-Anyway...
-The lab called.

93
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Are you leaving town
when you're done?

94
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
-You wanna take me to dinner?
-Want you out of here.

95
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000
They'll run the test
first thing in the morning

96
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and if there's no match.
you're gone.

97
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Tomorrow's no good.
My CO told me...

98
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Ah. I called your CO.

99
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
He says you should hang
until the tests are complete.

100
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
deliver the evidence tomorrow.

101
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Okay?

102
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Good to see you. Captain.

103
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Look at it this way...

104
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
give you a chance to visit all
those friends you left behind.

105
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Who says
that bad guys don't return

106
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000
How's it feel
to be back in uniform?

107
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Still padding your overtime.
Rogers?

108
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
-Ooh. That's. uh.
Sergeant Rogers now. Deke. Yes.

109
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

110
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000
-Hmm.
-

111
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Your phone's ringing.

112
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Yeah. I know.

113
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
We are being meticulous
and methodical in our efforts.

114
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Sergeant Rogers.
Yeah. but what did he say?

115
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
...and we are
in the process of evaluating

116
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
-Nice to see you. Deke.
-Good to see you. too.

117
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
...and gathering
additional evidence.

118
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
I can assure you all.
we are taking a 24/7.

119
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
all-hands-on-deck approach
to this case.

120
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
-These cases.
-

121
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Questions.

122
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Correct me if I'm wrong.
but what I'm hearing is

123
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
after two months
and four victims.

124
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000
you don't have a suspect.

125
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
None that I can discuss.

126
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Four dead girls. Jimmy.

127
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
We haven't been
under this much scrutiny

128
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
There's talk.

129
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Sheriff hinted that
we might wanna reach out

130
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
-Are you kidding me?
-Some point.

131
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Some point. Jimmy.
Not today.

132
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Deke?

133
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Son of a bitch.

134
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
-The man. the myth. the legend.
-Hey. Sal.

135
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000
You still hanging around?

136
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
No rest for the ugly.

137
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
-What are you doing here?

138
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Eh. don't ask. don't tell.

139
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
I'm just going
across the street.

140
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Come on.
what's one cup of coffee?

141
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
All right.

142
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Yeah.

143
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Who is that. talking to Sal?

144
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Kern County patrol dep.

145
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
That's Joe Deacon.

146
00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
You're kidding.

147
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
No.

148
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
They're
a bunch of nancies.

149
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
End of shift. I gotta beg for
somebody to grab a beer with.

150
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
They got no soul.
these new guys.

151
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
They weeded all the heart
out of the place.

152
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
But then. you know that
better than anybody.

153
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000
-Hey. Sarge.
-Sal.

154
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
-You know Joe Deacon?
-Get what you came for?

155
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
I will.

156
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000
You got nothing better to do
than to bust my balls

157
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Nothing personal.
Deke busts everybody's balls.

158
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
You wanna bullshit
John Q. Public

159
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
into thinking that
the worst is behind us.

160
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
that's your business.
until the next time.

161
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000
but. hey.
it's your shift. right?

162
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Yeah. it is.

163
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
I hear you're a good cop.

164
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
I hear things. too.

165
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
He is a good cop. Deke.
College boy.

166
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
bit of a Holy Roller.
but. hey. I've been thinking

167
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Get on the fast track
for a promotion.

168
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Sal. we're up.

169
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000
You wanna stay with me
and the wife tonight?

170
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Ah. nope.
Thank you. though.

171
00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
-Good to see you. Deke.
-Good to see you. too. brother.

172
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Why don't you
ride over with me?

173
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Maybe you can even
give me a few pointers.

174
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
-

175
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Everybody outside. nobody in.
Dollar to a dime.

176
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Baxter. 362071.
What's everybody

177
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Power's off
inside the victim's building.

178
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
-You call Edison?
-They're working on it now.

179
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
You been inside?

180
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
-How big's the place?
-Two-room efficiency.

181
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Due to the victim's
body position.

182
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
access is through the adjacent
apartment's fire escape.

183
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000
We got generators on the truck.

184
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Nah. let's let
the wazoo boys go to work.

185
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
You wanna superglue
the whole apartment?

186
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Why not?
We're dead in the water

187
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
-You familiar
with all of this?

188
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Things probably changed a lot
since you left.

189
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Still gotta catch him. right?

190
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
-Yeah.
-Hmm.

191
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Not that much
has changed. then.

192
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Anybody want some menthol?

193
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Everyone eat?

194
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
All right.

195
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Lights off.

196
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Holy shit!

197
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
by The Cucumbers

198
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Don't watch it

199
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Don't watch it

200
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Arterial wound...

201
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
stab wound. body cavity.

202
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Another stab wound.

203
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
She crawled to here...

204
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
all the way to here.

205
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
This is where she died.

206
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
So. why is she there?

207
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
They lift prints
from this window?

208
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Hey. Jimmy.
they dust that ledge yet?

209
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Get me the first officer.

210
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Still making house calls.
eh. Flo?

211
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Oh. good Lord.

212
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
-You in town for a while?
-No.

213
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Stick around till I'm finished.

214
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Okay.

215
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Joe Deacon. meet Julie Brock.

216
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Julie's 5'4". a buck 20.
and hails from

217
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
This job sucks.

218
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Hey.

219
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Our killer exited the same way
we came in.

220
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
It's your responsibility to
secure and protect the premises

221
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
From the moment she expired
to the time I cuff

222
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000
we work for her.

223
00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
-Yes. sir.
-Get out of here.

224
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
It's starting
to look a lot like Illinois.

225
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
-It's Michigan.
-Cut it out.

226
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
This been dusted?

227
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Yeah.
but it's broken.

228
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Not all of it.

229
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Hey.

230
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
When's your boy. Columbo.
gonna break my case for me?

231
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Deke's got his own style.

232
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
We're still
processing out that room.

233
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
What do you got. Flo?

234
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
She assumed room temperature
two or three days ago.

235
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
-We'll know more
when we take her in.

236
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Check the closets.

237
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Postmortem lividity.

238
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000
She was moved.

239
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
All right. canvass the block.
knock on every door.

240
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Find out Julie's habits.
friends. suitors. enemies.

241
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
They get anything
across the alley?

242
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
They lifted a print.
tested stains on the floor

243
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Pull files on any known
sex offenders in the area.

244
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Peeping Toms.
neighborhood arrests.

245
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Lean on the lab for prints.
all right?

246
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
-Mm-hmm.
-Jamie. lean on 'em.

247
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000
Okay.

248
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Awfully quiet
back there. Kojak.

249
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
-Am I missing something?

250
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Any of the other girls
have bites?

251
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000
Carrie Holland.

252
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000
One of 'em. Why?

253
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Similar to a case up north.
that's all.

254
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Deacon.

255
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Yeah?

256
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Sal says you're here overnight.

257
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
How about you buy me breakfast?

258
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Why would I wanna do that?

259
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
All right. I'll buy.

260
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Nick's. 0800.

261
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
If I'm still here.

262
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Go again on Wednesday?

263
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Yeah. sure. I'll run you home.

264
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Three blocks. I'll be fine.

265
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
-Night.
-Bye.

266
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Yeah.
surprised the DA. too.

267
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
She made a second-degree offer.

268
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
Kendricks copped a plea.

269
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
What about
the unforgettable boots?

270
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
Forget 'em. Don't need 'em.
Neither will Kendricks.

271
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Not where he's going.

272
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-All right.

273
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.000
Morning.

274
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
-Morning.
-Look. I know it was you

275
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000
spotted the observatory
across the street last night.

276
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Might have missed that one
without you.

277
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000
You're welcome.

278
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
-When you leaving?
-Right now.

279
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Oh. that's a shame.
I got something you might

280
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000
He got picked up twice
for peeping in

281
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Sheet says he's a KSO.

282
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Stan Peters.

283
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Picked up this morning
on a Ramey warrant.

284
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Letting him stew a bit.

285
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
He wants a mouthpiece.

286
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
You might wanna stay.

287
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
Nice boots.

288
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Hi. Stan. Jim.

289
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
-Where's my lawyer?
-In the building.

290
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Takes a while.

291
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000
A girl from
your neighborhood...

292
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
dead.

293
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000
And you.
a known sex offender...

294
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
I was taking a piss
and I was in the alley.

295
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
You had your dick out.

296
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
This girl...
- Teenage girl. Stan.

297
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
She was just walking by.

298
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000
You gotta believe me.

299
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000
I want to.

300
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
I got nothing to do with this.

301
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Yeah.

302
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000
What can you tell me
about Mary Roberts?

303
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Mary Roberts.

304
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Mary Roberts.
Stan Peters?

305
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Dead girl. suspect.

306
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Was he your boy?

307
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000
You never know.
Just saying hello

308
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000
Well. your old pal says
you broke his jaw once.

309
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
You gotta kiss a lot of frogs
to find your prince.

310
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000
What are you
still doing here?

311
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Just leaving.

312
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Order up the poor boy
on a Mary Roberts.

313
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000
I'm going for a sandwich.
You want one?

314
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Nah. I'm good.

315
00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000
The Rathbuns are waiting.

316
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000
Missing person.

317
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Yeah. they think
their daughter Ronda's a stat.

318
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
We got a corpse?

319
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Then it's still
Missing Persons.

320
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
So crazy. girl.
You're gonna fly out of here.

321
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000
-

322
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Don't you ever get tired
of looking at dead bodies?

323
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000
I could ask you the same.

324
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
What's this all about. Joe?

325
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Similar case up north.

326
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000
-Thanks for doing this
for me. Flo.

327
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000
She won't see the knife
till tomorrow.

328
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000
Well. she won't see
another knife.

329
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000
General proximity.
similar pattern and depth

330
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000
The garbage bag
was an adornment

331
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Maybe when the guy came back.

332
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Came back?

333
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Unless he was a babysitter.
he made a return trip.

334
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
moved the girl and propped her
up against the door.

335
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
Now. turn that up for me.

336
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Okay.

337
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Mm... KHRT. Love songs
of the '50s and '60s. Mm.

338
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000
You get a dental on the bites?

339
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
Right. Uh...

340
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
Yeah. we did a rush on it.
Inconclusive.

341
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
It could be
the same as we found

342
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
More sucking. less biting.

343
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000
Any saliva samples?

344
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
Funny you should ask.

345
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000
I found traces
of sodium benzoate

346
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000
-What's that?
-Used in mouthwash. Toothpaste.

347
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000
And check this out.

348
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
He gave her a postmortem shave.

349
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Nicked her. no blood.

350
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000
What about her D-tract?

351
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
She had one good meal
before she died.

352
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Speaking of which. you hungry?

353
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
I'll buy if you pull up
an old file for me.

354
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
Yeah.

355
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
Case up north. my ass.

356
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
The fuck is going on. Joe?

357
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
I'll pull your file.

358
00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000
But if something goes wrong.
I can't be there for you again.

359
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000
Okay.

360
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000
You knew him. didn't you?

361
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
That's why he did that
to your face.

362
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000
You let him in.

363
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
You thought...

364
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000
"Eh...

365
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
Not my type." but...

366
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
maybe he could be
a friend. I mean.

367
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000
you can't get enough of them.

368
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000
But then you had
that one little feeling.

369
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000
You thought. "What if?"

370
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000
But you waved it away.

371
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000
Thought. "Ah. what the hell?

372
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
Life's too short."

373
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
And you were right.

374
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Life is too short. Julie.

375
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000
And you should've listened.

376
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000
You should've listened to
that one little feeling. but...

377
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
Just like I'm listening
to you now.

378
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000
You can talk to me.

379
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
I'm all the friend you got.

380
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000
You know my take
on the world. Joe?

381
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000
There's good and there's bad.

382
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000
but you gotta fight.

383
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
Because. brother...

384
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
when I look in your eyes.

385
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
what I see...

386
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000
it ain't good.

387
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000
To remind me of what I did.

388
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000
For what we did.

389
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
I thought
you guys were finished.

390
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000
How long has this. uh.
fridge been broken?

391
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000
I don't know. A week. maybe.

392
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
You're responsible for repairs?

393
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
Oh. are you thinking
about moving in?

394
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
No. ma'am.

395
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000
I called a guy to come fix it.
but. uh. then. you know.

396
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
So. suddenly.
it didn't seem so important.

397
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000
And. I mean. look.
I gotta paint the walls

398
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
-Who'd you call?
-

399
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
Uh. a place
around the corner.

400
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000
AB... ABC Appliance.
Something like that.

401
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000
And the stuff in the fridge
was already rotten?

402
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
-Yeah. yeah.
-Mm-hmm. Except the milk?

403
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000
-My kid drank it. so cuff me.
-Oh.

404
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
-Anything else?
-In the fridge?

405
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000
There were a few beers. Why?

406
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000
I'm gonna need it for evidence.

407
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
For evidence.
Yeah. okay.

408
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000
-Coming right up.
-All righty.

409
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000
How do you
ever get used to it?

410
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.000
What's that. ma'am?

411
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000
The smell.

412
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.000
You know. if you're lucky.
you don't get used to it.

413
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000
Here.

414
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000
Close up when
you're done. okay?

415
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
I don't want any trouble.

416
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000
I have no connection
to the girls out front.

417
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000
-Just need a room.
-Oh.

418
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000
$20 a night. $100 a week.

419
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000
There are some things in there
from the last guy.

420
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.000
Just toss 'em in the hallway.

421
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000
And don't worry.
the sheets are clean.

422
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000
Hey!

423
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000
Do you want some company?

424
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Good night. I love you.
-  Love you.

425
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000
-I love you.
-Love you.

426
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000
-Did you say your prayers?
-Yep.

427
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000
-I'll see you tomorrow.
- Night.

428
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:31.000
Good night.

429
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Hey.
- Mm?

430
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Did you set the alarm?

431
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000
Yeah.

432
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000
It's never over.

433
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000
Re-interview the immigrants
in the Brock apartment.

434
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.000
Jimmy.

435
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000
All of 'em.

436
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Close it.

437
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
-Stan Peters.
-What about him?

438
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000
Killed himself last night.

439
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000
That's not good.

440
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000
What the hell's this got to do
with Kern County?

441
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000
Deacon watched
through the glass.

442
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000
He's got a similar case
up north.

443
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000
It's just a little
interagency cooperation.

444
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Guy hasn't worked a murder
since we ran him off

445
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000
Do you know the book on him?

446
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000
A great detective.
has a heart attack.

447
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000
leaves town
for a post in the sticks.

448
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000
The guy worked
the case so hard.

449
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000
he got a suspension.
a divorce and a triple bypass.

450
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000
Complete meltdown.

451
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000
He's a rush-hour train wreck.

452
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.000
That's a tad dramatic.

453
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000
Only good came out of it.
we got you.

454
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000
What are you saying?
I took his spot?

455
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
Manner of speaking. yeah.

456
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000
Piece of personal advice.
Jimmy.

457
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000
you got a good thing
going here.

458
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000
Don't get mixed up
with this guy.

459
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000
What's the big deal? He's gone.

460
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000
His CO says
he's taken vacation days.

461
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000
-Yeah. so what?
-Does he strike you

462
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000
as the kind of guy
that plays golf?

463
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000
Employee list.

464
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000
Repair appointment book.

465
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000
Look for yourself.

466
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000
So. I could
even have it delivered

467
00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000
All you gotta do is go out and
get some food. put it in there.

468
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
your kids are gonna be happy.
you're ready to go.

469
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000
Excuse me a minute.

470
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000
-What can I do for you?
-I'm Joe Deacon.

471
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000
I need to see all repair orders
for the last two weeks.

472
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000
and a list
of all your employees.

473
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000
Thank you.

474
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000
It's okay.
You're not under arrest.

475
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000
Yet.

476
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000
-Here you go.
-Thank you very much.

477
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000
This one's crossed out.

478
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000
-It's a cancellation.
-Yeah?

479
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000
That's before
I can get a man out.

480
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.000
And it always takes that long?

481
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Hey. we're busy.

482
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
Yeah.

483
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.000
Yeah. I see.

484
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000
And this is the list?

485
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.000
Mm...

486
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000
Mm.

487
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000
-And your name is?
-Jack.

488
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000
You all right. Jack?

489
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000
What's your last name. Jack?

490
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.000
Aboud.

491
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Thank you. Jack Aboud.

492
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000
You don't mind
if I take your list. do you?

493
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000
Salaam alaikum.

494
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000
Thanks. Jack.

495
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000
Did you look at my print
from the Brock apartment?

496
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000
It's no good
without one to compare to.

497
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000
The center's missing
and the computer can't

498
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000
Look on the bright side.
the guy finally left a partial.

499
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000
What exactly is it you guys do?

500
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000
We make you look good in court.

501
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
-Dad!

502
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000
Anything else?
Jewelry. maybe?

503
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000
A red barrette.

504
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000
When she ran. she always
used to wear a red barrette

505
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000
I'm gonna find her.

506
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:52.000
in clover

507
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000
Jesus.

508
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000
-

509
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000
It's not her.

510
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Really? This how you
spend your time off?

511
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000
When's the last time
you saw two hoop-dees

512
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000
and a meat wagon
going 20 miles an hour?

513
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000
They didn't wanna come
any more than I did.

514
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.000
What have you got?

515
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.000
Deceased fits the MO.

516
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000
Stab wound. ligature.
killed elsewhere.

517
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000
-She a floater?
-Yeah.

518
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000
But they dumped overflow
in here a few days back.

519
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000
Guessing there's mud
in her cavities.

520
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000
Shallow grave. most likely.

521
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000
You ready to tell me
about Mary Roberts?

522
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Your boy. Stan Peters.
swallowed a 12-gauge

523
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000
Hey. Jimmy.
come give a look.

524
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000
If you didn't know
any better. from up here...

525
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000
you might say it's beautiful.

526
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000
Sal told me you went to bat
for me with Farris.

527
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.000
It's not a wise career move.

528
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000
You're not exactly
a department favorite.

529
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000
Maybe I can make it up to you.

530
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000
You might wanna
run these names.

531
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:58.000
They were working
in appliance stores

532
00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000
It's a long shot.

533
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000
Aren't they all?

534
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000
Thank you.

535
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000
Something I gotta know.

536
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000
How's a guy with
the best clearance rate

537
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000
work 15 years
without a promotion?

538
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000
Maybe I didn't go
to the right church.

539
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.000
Hm.

540
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000
Do you believe in God. Joe?

541
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000
When I see a sunrise
or thunderstorm

542
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000
or dew on the ground.
yes. I think there's a God.

543
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000
When I see all this.
I think he's long past

544
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000
I still owe you breakfast.

545
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000
Yes. you do.

546
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000
This is great.
Thank you.

547
00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000
You're welcome.

548
00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.000
Joe's in Kern County now.

549
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Mm. Your wife drag you away?

550
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.000
I'm divorced.

551
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000
Oh. Well. I'd like to
get out of the city.

552
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000
-Hm.

553
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000
You work homicide there. too?

554
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000
Uh. no. ma'am. I'm just a...

555
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000
a dep.

556
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.000
Hi.

557
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000
Hi.
-My precious.

558
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.000
That's Mr. Deacon. Chloe.

559
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000
How do you do?

560
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.000
Very well.

561
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000
Do you have any kids. Joe?

562
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000
Uh. two girls. They're...
they're all grown now.

563
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000
All grown up.

564
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.000
I'm gonna be late.

565
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000
-We ready to take
Jen to school. baby?

566
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000
Got a parent-teacher conference
until 5:00.

567
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
so the girls are gonna stay
at Mom's until dinner.

568
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000
That's fine.
-Okay. I love you.

569
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000
Where are you going?

570
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.000
Nice to meet you. Joe.

571
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000
-She's beautiful.

572
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.000
They all are.

573
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.000
-Yeah.
-

574
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.000
I'll run the names on the list.
Where can I reach you?

575
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.000
St. Agnes.

576
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000
I've heard of
living on the beat.

577
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000
Wanna meet after shift.
compare notes?

578
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000
You may have to ask
the Reverend Captain

579
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000
It's my case.

580
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000
You look good. Marsha.

581
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000
-You too. Joe.
-Thank you.

582
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000
I was just on my way to work.
If I'd known

583
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.000
Gotta get going anyway.

584
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000
-Let me...
let me grab my purse.

585
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000
-House looks good.

586
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.000
Glad you kept it.

587
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Lawn. too.

588
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000
Yeah. well. Tom's a...

589
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000
He's a wiz in the yard.

590
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000
Better than me.

591
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000
Well. you never really had time
for that kind of thing.

592
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000
How are the girls?

593
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000
-Good.
-Good.

594
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000
You ought to give 'em a call.

595
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000
Yeah. Yeah.

596
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.000
Yeah.

597
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000
Yeah. I should.

598
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000
You all right?

599
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000
You know me.

600
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.000
Yeah.

601
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000
I know you.

602
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Well...

603
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.000
I gotta...

604
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000
All right.

605
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000
Bye. Joe.

606
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.000
Bye. Marsha.

607
00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:04.000
Mary Roberts.
Paige Callahan. Tamara Ewing.

608
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.000
I only asked for Roberts.

609
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000
Yeah. well.
all the victims were hookers.

610
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000
they were all found drugged
and stabbed to death

611
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.000
on the same night
in the same location.

612
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000
You gotta be kidding me.

613
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000
Yeah. I'm hilarious.

614
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000
-

615
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.000
I never figured
you to be so hip.

616
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000
Yeah. they must have...

617
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000
must have changed owners.

618
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000
You want something to drink?

619
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000
Don't worry. I won't tell.

620
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000
Where are you from? Originally.

621
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000
The Valley.

622
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.000
Where are you from?

623
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000
-Originally.
-Mississippi Valley.

624
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000
Alabama. Birmingham.

625
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000
Well. here's to being
from somewhere.

626
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

627
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.000
All right.
last night's victims...

628
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.000
so we got six now.

629
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000
One. Julie Brock.
never left home.

630
00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.000
Three from the north county.
bodies dumped here.

631
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.000
Two from here.
bodies dumped in north county.

632
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.000
And who said
busing doesn't work?

633
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000
All knifed. all gagged.
all bound.

634
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.000
all very organized killings.

635
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000
Not a lot of wasted motion.

636
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000
-So. I got a question. Why?
-Why what?

637
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000
First. geography.

638
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000
Yep. Guy's a shark.
If he stops. he dies.

639
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000
He likes to drive.
Probably has a decent car.

640
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000
Maybe two. High mileage.

641
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.000
Can't find one
in the neighborhood. a victim.

642
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000
then. uh. he goes
wherever opportunity knocks.

643
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.000
All right. next "why."
Why the extreme torture.

644
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.000
Turns him on.

645
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000
No rape. no sodomy.

646
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.000
-no genital mutilation. Hm.
-He kills for sexual pleasure.

647
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.000
Was Stan Peters our boy?

648
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000
God. I hope not.

649
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000
All right. back to the living.
Our boy.

650
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000
He's got balls.
I'll give him that.

651
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000
He goes back to Julie's house.

652
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.000
a few days after he kills her.
moves her body.

653
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:55.000
poses her. he brings beer.

654
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:58.000
milk. food. Just threw
himself a little party.

655
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000
And they found partially
digested meat in her stomach.

656
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000
But she was a vegan.
Strict vegetarian.

657
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000
She'd never touch it.
Same as Ana. No way.

658
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.000
Not even with a knife
to her throat?

659
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000
Nobody wants to eat alone.

660
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.000
Mm.

661
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.000
One last "why."

662
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000
Why are you trying to solve
a five-year-old case

663
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000
that everyone else
has forgotten about?

664
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000
Farris and I were...

665
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:46.000
a couple of miles away.
We heard a call over the radio.

666
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:51.000
Screams reported.
Sal was first one on the scene.

667
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000
No lights.

668
00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:01.000
Switching problem.
Guy from Edison said it happens

669
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000
Now. you see the woman
behind me

670
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.000
-over my left shoulder?
-Yeah.

671
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000
Gladys Fulcher. Spinster.

672
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.000
Sort of eyes and ears
of the neighborhood.

673
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.000
A pain in the ass to the cops
but a godsend to a detective.

674
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.000
And what did good old
Gladys have to say?

675
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.000
Said she was out.
She lied about it at first

676
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000
but she came clean.

677
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.000
What was she embarrassed about?

678
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.000
She went on her
first date in 15 years.

679
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.000
So. the night of the hat trick.
we had no lights.

680
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.000
Gladys getting boned...

681
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:39.000
two-million-to-one long shot
crossing the finish line

682
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.000
in a dead heat.

683
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000
Third strike.

684
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:45.000
Drought.

685
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:50.000
No water. no mud. no prints.

686
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.000
Ground was hard like cement.

687
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000
Victims were placed
on that rock right there.

688
00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.000
They were drugged elsewhere.
but they were brought here.

689
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000
Posed facing each other.

690
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:07.000
bags over their heads.
laid down. like the rock

691
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.000
tea party.

692
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000
Where the guests fell asleep.

693
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.000
Warm. This just went down.

694
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.000
And where was
your third victim?

695
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000
Close by.

696
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:28.000
You work the evidence.
you still come up with zeros.

697
00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000
It's all you can do.
Happens to everybody.

698
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:36.000
Then you draw the black bean.

699
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:40.000
Maybe the victim looks like
a kid you picked on in school

700
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:43.000
or the green eyes
remind you of your old lady.

701
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.000
Or maybe it's something else.
but whatever it is.

702
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000
they're your lifelong
responsibility. Jimmy.

703
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000
You own them.

704
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000
You own them.

705
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.000
They're wherever they are.
and you are their angel.

706
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:14.000
trying like hell to turn the
ledger from red to black.

707
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:17.000
Word to the wise. Jimmy.
stay out of the angel business.

708
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000
Hey.

709
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.000
What is it you're looking for
in all of this?

710
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000
To finish the job.

711
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.000
Just like you.

712
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:36.000
It's not the same boy.

713
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000
Guys that kill pros
are a different breed

714
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000
than the ones
that go after solid citizens.

715
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.000
Yeah. nobody's that good
out of the block.

716
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000
This boy practiced his trade
somewhere before.

717
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.000
Well. it can't be the same guy.

718
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.000
He's a shark. remember?
He stops. he dies.

719
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.000
Who said he stopped? Maybe he
just took his show on the road.

720
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.000
I'm over here on the right.

721
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000
Two of the five appliance
store employees have records.

722
00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:01.000
One's 55. the other one's
in his late thirties.

723
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.000
Both simple assaults.

724
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000
It looks like a wash to me.

725
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:07.000
but you got all the info there.

726
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:10.000
And for the record. your hunch?
I don't think it holds water.

727
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000
Then why all the interest?

728
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:15.000
You wanna
clear your conscience.

729
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.000
But you gotta solve my case to
solve yours. who am I to moan?

730
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.000
But you piss on my leg
and call it rain.

731
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:27.000
Hey. uh. what was
Julie's last supper?

732
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000
It was roast beef. Why?

733
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:35.000
It's the little things
that are important. Jimmy.

734
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.000
It's the little things
that get you caught.

735
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000
Can I help you?

736
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000
I saw
the "for sale" sign.

737
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000
That was for another car.

738
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.000
Got a lot of miles on it.
You a... you a salesman?

739
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000
No.

740
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000
How's the trunk space?

741
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000
It's standard.

742
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.000
Mind if I take a look?

743
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000
I'm in the market.

744
00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.000
It's not for sale.

745
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000
All I need to do is
take a look.

746
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:04.000
You must really like my car.

747
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000
-I do.
-

748
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000
Hey. Sal. listen.

749
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.000
Run a DMV check
on an Albert Leonard Sparma.

750
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000
Yeah. see if he's sold any cars
in the last few months.

751
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000
Inconclusive.

752
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:22.000
But there are some similarities
to both Brock and Ewing.

753
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000
Partial of an incisor
on Ewing's cheek.

754
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.000
What about Brock?

755
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:29.000
Partial of a bicuspid.

756
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:30.000
-Something else.
-What's that?

757
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:33.000
He's from back east.

758
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:34.000
Folds his slice.

759
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000
to my guy

760
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000
you could buy

761
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:19.000
to my guy

762
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:24.000
my word of honor

763
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:29.000
and I'm gonna...

764
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:47.000
to be exact

765
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:50.000
as a matter of fact

766
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:54.000
could take my hand

767
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
We'll canvass over here.

768
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
You have a good night.

769
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000
We got roast beef.
we got strippers...

770
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Baby. you got anything
for us tonight?

771
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
We got hookers.

772
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Damn. homie.

773
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000
You don't know
how lucky y'all are.

774
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Okay.

775
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000
How's the trunk space?

776
01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
-Baxter.
-The second girl.

777
01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
where did you find her?

778
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Couple hundred yards after 126.

779
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000
-And you didn't leak it
to the press?

780
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
You sure about that?

781
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
It went out over dispatch.
but it was never given

782
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000
What's the nearest mile marker?

783
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Hang on.

784
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000
467.

785
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
4-6-7.

786
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000
There's this guy Deke asked me
to run a vehicle check on.

787
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Seems that Topanga Tow
has a car registered to him.

788
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Found it abandoned
two weeks ago.

789
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Reported stolen?

790
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000
No.

791
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Well. tow that sucker in.

792
01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
-Wine.
- Damn it.

793
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Sal. what do you got?

794
01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Clean. 22.000 miles.

795
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000
-A rollback?
-Definitely.

796
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000
All right. keep at it.
Let me know

797
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Here we go.

798
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000
I'll take the prints.
Call the lab.

799
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Grab Deke and a patrol dep.
pick up Sparma.

800
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
What about Tina Salvatore.
the potential witness?

801
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Get her a magazine.

802
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
What are the chances
he'll let us in?

803
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Yeah. Just keep him busy.
keep him talking.

804
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Tell him to take his time.
change his clothes. whatever.

805
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Match is inconclusive.

806
01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
-Conclude it.
-Eleven identifiers.

807
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000
County requires 18 for an ID.
LAPD requires 12.

808
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:41.000
So. we're one short of
somebody's legal requirements?

809
01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
-That says something.
-It says you're seven short.

810
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Look me in the eye
and tell me this isn't my boy.

811
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
This other fella...

812
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
let's call him Mr. X...

813
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000
he's got eight identifiers.
Only three less than Sparma.

814
01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Maybe he's the killer.

815
01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Who?

816
01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Thank you.

817
01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Are we ready to go?

818
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000
It's like
I told the police...

819
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
it was dark. he was
wearing glasses. a hat...

820
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000
If I showed you some photos.
do you think you'd be able to

821
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Maybe.

822
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Probably not.

823
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Nothing. It was like
he was expecting us.

824
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Get her something to drink.
Keep an eye on her.

825
01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
I have to use the restroom.

826
01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Come on.

827
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000
It's. uh. right over here.
to your right.

828
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Hey. you got a second. Jamie?

829
01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
It's okay. I can find my way
back to your desk.

830
01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000
All right.
do you want anything to drink?

831
01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Uh... Diet anything.

832
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Just come straight back. okay?

833
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000
-What's up?
-Thanks.

834
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000
The Harvester was clean
as a whistle.

835
01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Damn it.

836
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Got this off your desk.

837
01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
You don't mind if I move
the table. do you?

838
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Do your thing.

839
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Grab the other end.

840
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
All clear.

841
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Bring him in.

842
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Okay. Jerry.

843
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Well. what did you have to do
to get a job like this?

844
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Kind of a demotion. huh?

845
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
No. we're not gonna need those.

846
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Where's big Dick Tracy?

847
01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Is he joining us for dinner?

848
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Ow. Man...

849
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Hello. Albert.

850
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
I'm Detective Sergeant Baxter.

851
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000
I know who you are.

852
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
You're famous.

853
01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000
On television and in the papers
all the time.

854
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Thank you so much.

855
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
I'm kind of a crime buff.

856
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Hm.

857
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Well. then you know
if you're innocent.

858
01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.000
you should talk to me.
clear your name.

859
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Is that it?

860
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Not gonna work me over.
Mr. Clean?

861
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Okay.

862
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000
I invoke my
Fifth Amendment right

863
01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Just kidding.

864
01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
You should see
the look on your faces.

865
01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Come on. it's hilarious.

866
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
But I would like my rights
waiver card.

867
01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.000
I know I'm not
officially in custody. but...

868
01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
better be safe than sorry.
huh. guys?

869
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Hot damn.

870
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
This is awesome.

871
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Can I keep this?

872
01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000
No. I'm afraid not.

873
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
No fun.

874
01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Hey. you wanna know something?
Ernesto Miranda...

875
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
was actually guilty.

876
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Why did you abandon
your car. Albert?

877
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.000
The Harvester.
Had a big back end. was good

878
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Look. Jimmy.

879
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
-Detective Baxter.
-Whatever.

880
01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Like I said.
the car was stolen.

881
01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
I'll drive it home.

882
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000
We'll be hanging on to it
for a few days.

883
01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Well. that's not
very nice of you.

884
01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Why didn't you
report the theft?

885
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Well. you see.
that's the funny thing.

886
01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
I did.

887
01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Somebody's got some
homework to do.

888
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Mm. Cute little thing.
wasn't she?

889
01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
-Who said she's dead?
-I know the drill. Jimmy.

890
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
But the truth is...

891
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
I'm not the guy.

892
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Besides. if you had anything...

893
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000
anything at all...

894
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000
I'd be under arrest...

895
01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
wouldn't I?

896
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Do you want to be?

897
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.000
I wouldn't mind getting
a peek at all that evidence

898
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Is that for me?

899
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
You get the feeling
he's enjoying this?

900
01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Oh. yeah.

901
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Pineapples and jalapenos.
please.

902
01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Can I come in?

903
01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Eleven more.
you can make a calendar.

904
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Uh-oh.

905
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Oh. hey. stranger.

906
01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Tired of steaming up
that glass?

907
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Pressies?

908
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Oh. yeah.

909
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:22.000
This is the part where I start
feeling like it's a trap.

910
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Open it up. find out.

911
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
It's not a pair of mittens.

912
01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Wow.

913
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Go on. take a look.

914
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
You know you want to.

915
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Open it. you fucking weirdo.

916
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Holy guacamole.

917
01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Eeny. meeny. miny. moe.

918
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000
catch a dead girl by her toe.

919
01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Oh...

920
01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
The contrast is all off.

921
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000
It's no Weegee.

922
01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000
My God.

923
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Let me ask you a question.

924
01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Why is that?

925
01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Huh?

926
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Why is that?

927
01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Hm? Come on.
you're a smart man.

928
01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000
You know every exit
on the highway.

929
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Let me help you.

930
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
I mean it.

931
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Why?

932
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Why not?

933
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Son of a bitch.
Your dick is as hard

934
01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.000
-Shit.
-Son of a...

935
01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Deke! Hey. Deke!
- That's why.

936
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000
-That's why.
- Back off!

937
01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
-Why is that? Why is that?
- Deke! Hey! Whoa!

938
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.000
-That's what I wanna know.
- Back off.

939
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Hey. Hey.

940
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:07.000
It's all right.
It's all right. Sal.

941
01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
We know. you know...

942
01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000
...we got you by the balls.
small as they are.

943
01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
You son of a bitch.

944
01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.000
You lost control.

945
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.000
-Rizoli.

946
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
-Huh. Jimmy. it's your wife.
-Take a message.

947
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000
What do you think?

948
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Maybe if I could
get a better look at him.

949
01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.000
What do you mean.
a better look?

950
01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Well. at this guy.

951
01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.000
I mean. you have him
here in the station. right?

952
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Thank you. Tina.

953
01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Look. I'm sorry.
What about a lineup?

954
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.000
We've got no cause.

955
01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
I mean. the ID is
tainted beyond repair.

956
01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.000
She saw him in cuffs.
for God's sake.

957
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.000
I told you.
I warned you.

958
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000
I take the heat.

959
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
-I'm the primary.
-For now.

960
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
What the hell does that mean?

961
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000
It means I got six bodies.
no witnesses. no evidence.

962
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Two guys questioned.
and why are they suspects?

963
01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
One. who later sucks
on a 12-gauge.

964
01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.000
for malicious unzipping.

965
01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.000
The other. for carrying
a concealed hard-on.

966
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000
-What do you want the DA to do?
-He was visualizing the crime.

967
01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.000
His crime.

968
01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Well. sheriff's calling
in the feds.

969
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
They got a guy
coming in on Monday.

970
01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
That point. we back off.
we revamp.

971
01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000
-Revamp?
-They take charge.

972
01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Hey. uh. one more thing.

973
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Were you aware Sparma confessed
to a murder eight years ago?

974
01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Guy walks in...

975
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
and we spent ten hours
going over the thing.

976
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.000
He signs a confession.
Next morning. we had

977
01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
-Why?
- He was lying.

978
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.000
I mean.
he knew all the details.

979
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
but he wasn't within
ten miles of the killing.

980
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Still got two days. right. Cap?

981
01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Hey. what is it with
you and Deke?

982
01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000
You wanna be the one
that finds him after his

983
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
It's his destiny.
don't make it yours.

984
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Deacon.

985
01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Boo.

986
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
What is... what is all this?

987
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.000
The past becomes the future.
becomes the past...

988
01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
becomes the future.
becomes the past.

989
01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.000
-Hey. Look at me.
-Becomes the future.

990
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.000
This is sick.

991
01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
-You need to get some help.
-Don't point fingers.

992
01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000
I know all the symptoms.

993
01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Congratulations.
We got a suspect.

994
01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Oh. we do. do we?

995
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Yeah.

996
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Are you aware that Sparma
confessed to a murder

997
01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.000
So what?

998
01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.000
He walked in.
jerked Rogers' chain

999
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
He's a crime buff.
he said so himself.

1000
01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Walk-in confessors
aren't killers.

1001
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000
We don't have shit!

1002
01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
You got the same ache
in your gut as I do. don't you?

1003
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
We got something.
we just don't know what it is.

1004
01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.000
If I can get in Sparma's
apartment for just

1005
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000
We don't have enough
for a warrant.

1006
01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000
...like I'm standing
in front of you.

1007
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000
I know.

1008
01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Know what?

1009
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.000
I know that the answer is
inside Sparma's place. I know.

1010
01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Let me ask you something.
Jimmy.

1011
01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.000
What do you want?

1012
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
I wanna nail the bastard.

1013
01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.000
For who?

1014
01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.000
For all of the girls he killed.

1015
01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.000
And for Ronda Rathbun.
wherever she is.

1016
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Well. I wanna
nail the bastard. too.

1017
01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Difference is...

1018
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
I'm doing it for me.

1019
01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Just five minutes. Jimmy.

1020
01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Please.

1021
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
I'm sorry
about what happened today.

1022
01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:14.000
and I'd like to
make it up to you in person.

1023
01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Meet me at Pike's.
near your place. on the bully.

1024
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
That the place
with potato skins?

1025
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000
We'll see.

1026
01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.000
He comes back.
I'll hit the horn twice.

1027
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
7-0. respond.

1028
01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Code seven. Fifth and Main.

1029
01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Hey. you got a phone?

1030
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Yeah.

1031
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
It's local.

1032
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
And a Shirley Temple to go.

1033
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Officer down.

1034
01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Repeat. officer down.

1035
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.000
10929 San Marina Street.

1036
01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Repeat. officer down.

1037
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
LAPD. open up!

1038
01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Going right.

1039
01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Hey!

1040
01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
LA Sheriff. What's going on?

1041
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.000
There's an officer down.
Two guys inside now.

1042
01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Hey. hey. hey.
All respect. Detective.

1043
01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
your jurisdiction doesn't start
for another 20 blocks. Move.

1044
01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Sheriff's.
-Baxter. 362071.

1045
01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.000
How can I help you?

1046
01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Detective Baxter.

1047
01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Detective--

1048
01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Bathroom's clear.
-Clear.

1049
01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Sparma called in
an "officer down."

1050
01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Wily son of a bitch.

1051
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Wily enough to keep his
apartment clean?

1052
01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:08.000
He's got a box full of
knickknacks and souvenirs.

1053
01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.000
By any chance.
did you see a red barrette?

1054
01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
-Red barrette?
-Yeah.

1055
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Ronda Rathbun was wearing one
when she disappeared.

1056
01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.000
You give me five more minutes.
I can find out for you.

1057
01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
All right. bad news first.

1058
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Sparma did file
a stolen on the wagon.

1059
01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.000
The good...

1060
01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Sparma left town less than
six weeks after your murders.

1061
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Where'd he go?

1062
01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Detroit.

1063
01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Any unsolved bodies up there?

1064
01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Detroit?

1065
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Right.

1066
01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
He knows we're here.
He knows we're watching him.

1067
01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Good.

1068
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
I want him to know.

1069
01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Do you ever wonder...

1070
01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.000
that maybe. just maybe.
it's a waste of time?

1071
01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:17.000
All this sitting. waiting...

1072
01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:22.000
watching. spending your life
in another man's shadow.

1073
01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.000
One. wherever he goes.
I mark it for search warrants.

1074
01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Two. he tries it again.
I catch him in the act.

1075
01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Three. when I'm with him...

1076
01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
nobody dies.

1077
01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Nobody dies on my watch.

1078
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000
How long is your watch?

1079
01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
As long as it fucking takes.

1080
01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
What's he doing?

1081
01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.000
How can you listen to these
sappy love songs all day long?

1082
01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Reminds me of being 16
in the backseat of my car...

1083
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
with Marsha McConnell.

1084
01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Guy's got a car.
why's he taking the bus?

1085
01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:19.000
wherever he may go

1086
01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:23.000
an ocean too deep

1087
01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:30.000
it can keep me away

1088
01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:38.000
my hand I knew

1089
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
This is fucking comical.

1090
01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.000
We're running out of sand.
this guy's taking

1091
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.000
You run this place?

1092
01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Yeah. No connection.

1093
01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Whoa. Whoa.
-Ah. fuck!

1094
01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Hey. you all right?

1095
01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
I'm all right.

1096
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Okay.

1097
01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Mm-hmm.

1098
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:16.000
We work the case.
That's all we can do.

1099
01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
It's like fishing.

1100
01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:21.000
You can go days without a
strike. then all of a sudden.

1101
01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.000
I'm fucking dying here. Deke.

1102
01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Okay. Why don't you go home.

1103
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.000
I'll put him to bed.

1104
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
-Fuck you.
-There you go.

1105
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.000
That's what I expected.

1106
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
You think they got watch
batteries down there?

1107
01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Mm.

1108
01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
All right.
I'm gonna go down there.

1109
01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Black coffee.

1110
01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.000
All right.

1111
01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.000
-

1112
01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
-Hello?
-Boo.

1113
01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Get your hands in the air!

1114
01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
-Now!
-Okay. okay.

1115
01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Do it now! Up against the gate.

1116
01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Move!

1117
01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
-Move!
- Okay.

1118
01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Is this right? This...

1119
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
-Forward!
-Okay. Fine.

1120
01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.000
Hands on your head!

1121
01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Interlace your fingers.

1122
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Excuse me?

1123
01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Interlace your fingers.

1124
01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Oh. Um...

1125
01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:43.000
That sounds complicated. Mm.

1126
01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Point your fingers to the sky.

1127
01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Now!

1128
01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:50.000
-Spread your legs.
-Thought you'd never ask.

1129
01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
-Where is she?
-Oh.

1130
01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:03.000
The original.
How did you wrangle that.

1131
01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Where is she?

1132
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
You don't wanna know.

1133
01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Not really.

1134
01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Okay. okay.

1135
01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Okay.

1136
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
You win.

1137
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.000
I'll take you to her.

1138
01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Would you like that?

1139
01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Jeez.

1140
01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Are you coming?

1141
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:44.000
You got some serious
anger issues. Jimmy.

1142
01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
You almost cracked my rib.

1143
01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
40. 50...

1144
01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:58.000
60. 70...

1145
01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Come on.

1146
01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
I won't bite.

1147
01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Get in.
We've got a drive ahead of us.

1148
01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:31.000
And I've gotta work tomorrow.

1149
01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.000
You already felt me up.
You're armed. I'm not.

1150
01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.000
What are you so scared of.
little boy?

1151
01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Oh. PS. your buttbuddy's
not invited.

1152
01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Buckle up.

1153
01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Safety first.

1154
01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.000
You know.
you're not very good company.

1155
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Where exactly is it
we're going?

1156
01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Ronda Rathbun?

1157
01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
You know.
you and I are a lot alike.

1158
01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
In another lifetime...

1159
01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.000
uh. we could be friends.

1160
01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Isn't that crazy?

1161
01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Jimmy. Jimmy. Jimmy.

1162
01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.000
You mind?

1163
01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
I knew a guy
who had a hunting lease here.

1164
01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.000
And we got the moon tonight.

1165
01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
Cut the bullshit. Where is she?

1166
01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.000
All business.

1167
01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
You start walking that way.

1168
01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
Hm.

1169
01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
I'm a man of my word. Jimmy.

1170
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Chilly.

1171
01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Colder.

1172
01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.000
No. no. Cold.

1173
01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:22.000
God. you're really terrible
at this. you know that?

1174
01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Let me give you a hint.

1175
01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:28.000
That way.

1176
01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Okay.

1177
01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Uh-uh. Warm.

1178
01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Warmer.

1179
01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Hot. Hotter.

1180
01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.000
Hottest.

1181
01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Bingo.

1182
01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Now look down at the ground
and say...

1183
01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.000
"Hello. Ronda."

1184
01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.000
You're gonna need this.

1185
01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
You dig.

1186
01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:10.000
The devil's
in the details. Jimmy.

1187
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Witnesses. physical evidence.

1188
01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
You'd have to get rid of
my body. get rid of my car.

1189
01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:17.000
It's a lot to consider.

1190
01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Besides...

1191
01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
it's a peace offering.

1192
01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Okay.

1193
01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Oh. you're gonna kill me.

1194
01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Uh...

1195
01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Oh. poop.

1196
01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:20.000
I think I made a boo-boo.

1197
01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Yeah. Come to think of it.
this doesn't look

1198
01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
But this one over here...

1199
01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
this looks very promising.

1200
01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Yeah. that's it.

1201
01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.000
What did you say?

1202
01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Um...

1203
01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
"Poop."

1204
01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Then.
"This one is more promising."

1205
01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:52.000
It's not like
I have a fucking treasure map.

1206
01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:05.000
I keep digging.
you keep talking.

1207
01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
X marks the spot.

1208
01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Third time's the charm.

1209
01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
It's like the cereal aisle.

1210
01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
You want the truth?

1211
01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:01.000
I've never killed anybody
in my entire life.

1212
01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.000
If you believe me.
we can get in the car and

1213
01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Maybe even stop for tacos.

1214
01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:12.000
If not...

1215
01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
-That's it.

1216
01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Not too much longer now.

1217
01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:07.000
What are you. five. six deep.
and no end in sight?

1218
01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Oh...

1219
01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
I forgot to tell you.

1220
01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
I've seen a picture
of your family.

1221
01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:24.000
You should've stayed out
of the public eye. Jimmy.

1222
01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:29.000
You and your ego.

1223
01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:34.000
I mean. what kind of
a father are you?

1224
01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
How can you protect
those two beautiful daughters

1225
01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:41.000
when you can't even
begin to help one...

1226
01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:44.000
of those poor girls
or their families?

1227
01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
You're insignificant.

1228
01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:51.000
You don't matter.

1229
01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:56.000
And this will go on
and on and on.

1230
01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

1231
01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Hey. Hey. Hey. get up.

1232
01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Get up. man.

1233
01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Get up!

1234
01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Get up!

1235
01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Deke. what is it?
- Quiet.

1236
01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:35.000
Oh.

1237
01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Oh. shit.

1238
01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
The past
becomes the future.

1239
01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.000
becomes the future...

1240
01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:47.000
becomes the past.
becomes the future...

1241
01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
becomes the future.

1242
01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
It was him.

1243
01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
We got him. He was our boy.

1244
01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
He was our boy.
He as much as told me.

1245
01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Nothing you can do
about it now.

1246
01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:27.000
We gotta call somebody.

1247
01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
What am I gonna say?

1248
01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
What am I gonna do?

1249
01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
Nothing. You're not gonna say
anything. you're not gonna do

1250
01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
You're gonna find a hole.
stick him in it.

1251
01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:45.000
Pick one at least four feet
deep. I'll be back in a few

1252
01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
What'd she say. man?

1253
01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
What's up with homeboy
there?

1254
01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Hey.

1255
01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
He was our boy. Deke.
I'm sure he was our boy.

1256
01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Nobody's gonna give a damn.
I've taken care of it.

1257
01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
So. listen...

1258
01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
you go back.

1259
01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:20.000
you tell Farris
that Sparma was a wash.

1260
01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
and that you need a break.

1261
01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:27.000
A couple of weeks. You tell him
I left town Saturday.

1262
01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:28.000
and you went home.

1263
01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
Are you listening to me?

1264
01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
He's dead.

1265
01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
He's forgotten.
He's rotting in the ground

1266
01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:41.000
and the only way
he's gonna come back

1267
01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
Don't you ever go back to his
place.

1268
01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:47.000
don't you ever let his name
cross your lips.

1269
01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:50.000
don't you ever pull his file.
'cause if you do...

1270
01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:54.000
he'll rise up out of that
ground. He'll do you in.

1271
01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:59.000
It's the little things. Jimmy.

1272
01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
It's the little things
that rip you apart.

1273
01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
it's the little things that...

1274
01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
get you caught.

1275
01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
That's my boy.

1276
01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
He was...

1277
01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Joe...

1278
01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Sí.

1279
01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:12.000
And that
brings to an end

1280
01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:15.000
Thanks for listening
for all these many years.

1281
01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
It's twelve o'clock.

1282
01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:20.000
Straight-up noon. LA.
This is Bobby Saunders.

1283
01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
and I'm saying welcome
to the new KHVY.

1284
01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:25.000
the king of talk radio.
where what you have to say--

1285
01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:40.000
A white male.
between the ages of 25 and 40.

1286
01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:43.000
He's of above-average
intelligence and socially

1287
01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
Works as a skilled laborer.

1288
01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
Probably firstborn or an only
child.

1289
01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.000
And he follows the crimes in
the media.

1290
01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
He has at least one car
in good condition.

1291
01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
and he has a propensity
for changing jobs.

1292
01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Picking up.
leaving at a moment's notice.

1293
01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:02.000
That. ladies and gentlemen.
is the guy we're looking for.

1294
01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
What about the leads we're
following?

1295
01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
I think it's safe to say
we're at square one

1296
01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
But I can promise you this.

1297
01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
We'll get the bastard.

1298
01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:28.000
-Ana.
-Hey. Sal.

1299
01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:30.000
Come in.

1300
01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
Thanks. I gotta get going.

1301
01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:34.000
You okay?

1302
01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:42.000
We miss him already. Uh...

1303
01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:43.000
Joe Deacon gave me this.

1304
01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
Said it was for Jimmy.

1305
01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:50.000
Thanks.

1306
01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:51.000
Take care.

1307
01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:52.000
You too.

1308
01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Thanks. Sal.

1309
01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:00.000
You know I love you. Dad.
But go away?

1310
01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:03.000
You're always around
when I don't need you.

1311
01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
-

1312
01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Sal brought this by.

1313
01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:33.000
He said it was from Joe Deacon.

1314
02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
Cause of death. multiple stab
wounds.

1315
02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
That's what I'm putting down.
