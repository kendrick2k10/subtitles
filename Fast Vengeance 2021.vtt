3
00:01:05.357 --> 00:01:08.599
I'll get it. I promise.

4
00:01:15.701 --> 00:01:19.944
So this is the infamous
cobra Lane. huh?

5
00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:29.123
This is where the
races took place.

6
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.166
Yeah. of course it took
a homicide to do that.

7
00:01:36.597 --> 00:01:37.757
What'd you find?

8
00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:42.557
This whole Lane's owned by
Chinese triads.

9
00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:44.555
It's private property.

10
00:01:45.606 --> 00:01:49.394
almost a mile of docking
warehouses. just for produce.

11
00:01:51.612 --> 00:01:52.647
Clearly.

12
00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:54.549
Yeah. we're
interviewing the viewers.

13
00:01:54.573 --> 00:01:56.154
The company's been
stripped down.

14
00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.405
That's why the case
will go nowhere.

15
00:02:01.705 --> 00:02:02.945
It's personal.

16
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.371
Just following
protocol. captain.

17
00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:38.377
This shen.

18
00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:42.506
Yeah.

19
00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:01.066
You sure?

20
00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.826
Thank you.

21
00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:41.440
You will be avenged.

22
00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:46.323
I guarantee it.

23
00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:01.585
Tell mom and dad hi for me.

24
00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:39.210
Excuse me. my name is shen.
shen long.

25
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.297
I came to inquire about
the death of my brother.

26
00:05:42.801 --> 00:05:45.292
It was a motorcycle
accident and homicide.

27
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.884
You got a case number.
location. date of incident.

28
00:05:50.058 --> 00:05:53.391
name of individuals
involved in the incident?

29
00:05:53.562 --> 00:05:55.143
I don't have a case number.

30
00:05:55.856 --> 00:05:58.643
I'm just hoping to get some
some details of what happened.

31
00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:01.312
I can't help you then.

32
00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:08.152
Sergeant. please.

33
00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:11.245
Sergeant!

34
00:06:12.873 --> 00:06:15.535
Captain. captain!

35
00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:29.928
What do you want. kid?

36
00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:35.843
I need to know what happened
to my brother tien long.

37
00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:45.860
Hell.

38
00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:47.489
Please.

39
00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:52.075
Let's make it quick.

40
00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:00.284
That's all we have.

41
00:07:14.017 --> 00:07:15.302
That's it?

42
00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:19.394
Tell me you have something else.

43
00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:24.891
Where did you say
you're from again?

44
00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:29.278
Ti came from California.

45
00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:32.277
Long ways.

46
00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:35.338
Is that where you said
your brother was from?

47
00:07:36.706 --> 00:07:37.706
Yeah.

48
00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:41.620
No. no. we grew up here.

49
00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:46.330
Ended up moving there
because I had a job.

50
00:07:46.508 --> 00:07:47.918
What...

51
00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:50.458
You said it was a
motorcycle gang?

52
00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:51.762
One of them.

53
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:54.550
Which one?

54
00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:55.891
Where are they?

55
00:07:57.519 --> 00:08:00.727
Look. these motorcycle gangs.

56
00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:04.310
they basically do what
the fuck they wanna do.

57
00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:08.477
Gangs. triads. god
knows what else.

58
00:08:09.072 --> 00:08:11.438
If you think it's hard
catching one gangster.

59
00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:14.365
try catching one going
200 miles an hour.

60
00:08:16.413 --> 00:08:18.654
This gang got a name. is
it local. what?

61
00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:21.448
Why haven't you
arrested anybody?

62
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.331
We found his body in a strip.

63
00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:27.328
It's owned by local businesses.

64
00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:33.172
Until it was a homicide.
there was nothing we could do.

65
00:08:35.223 --> 00:08:36.588
Yeah.

66
00:08:38.143 --> 00:08:39.178
Yeah.

67
00:08:40.645 --> 00:08:42.260
Where is this place?

68
00:08:45.817 --> 00:08:47.682
You come off as the
reckless type.

69
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.981
looking to go in there
guns blazing.

70
00:08:59.664 --> 00:09:01.325
Well. you know what?

71
00:09:03.334 --> 00:09:05.746
Somebody's gotta pay
for his death.

72
00:09:09.007 --> 00:09:11.589
And let me guess.
you're gonna be

73
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.966
the one who makes them pay.

74
00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:16.628
Well. who else is gonna do it?

75
00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:21.008
You found anything. huh.
made any progress. huh?

76
00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.018
We can't discuss anything
that's an ongoing investigation.

77
00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:29.600
I just need a fucking name!
Okay?

78
00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:30.858
Just give me a name!

79
00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:33.653
Listen!

80
00:09:34.032 --> 00:09:35.632
I understand
emotions are running high...

81
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.531
No shit it's running high!

82
00:09:37.702 --> 00:09:39.533
I understand. I get it.

83
00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:41.786
Do you understand how I feel?

84
00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:47.875
We'll give you a call
if we find out anything.

85
00:09:52.884 --> 00:09:55.250
I know exactly what that means.

86
00:10:02.685 --> 00:10:04.266
Good day. captain.

87
00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:26.414
Should've known you'd
still have my keys

88
00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:27.661
after all these years.

89
00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:30.789
Hey. pops.

90
00:10:33.716 --> 00:10:35.081
Good to see you. son.

91
00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:41.595
Thanks for taking care
of the funeral.

92
00:10:41.933 --> 00:10:44.174
Hey. hey. hey. don't even
think about it.

93
00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:49.228
I made plenty of money off
of you back in the day.

94
00:10:58.158 --> 00:10:59.694
Yeah.

95
00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.072
Yeah. your opponents. they
could never figure you out.

96
00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:06.909
Your speed. you're
different in every round.

97
00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:09.495
changing up your pace.
your style.

98
00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:13.624
Yeah. yeah.

99
00:11:13.882 --> 00:11:16.043
Yeah. those were the days. huh?

100
00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:22.299
Those were the days.

101
00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:27.892
You know. I keep thinking

102
00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:32.559
maybe if I spent less
time fighting.

103
00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:35.521
more time with tien.
maybe he'd still be here...

104
00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:37.151
Don't do that to yourself.

105
00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:39.695
Your brother got
himself involved

106
00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:41.447
in that underground world.

107
00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:43.737
I feel guilty. too.

108
00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:46.239
I didn't know about it.

109
00:11:46.623 --> 00:11:48.309
If I did. maybe there was
something we could've done.

110
00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:50.324
but we couldn't. and
here we are.

111
00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:53.076
Yeah. here we are.

112
00:11:54.797 --> 00:11:56.583
Well. let me tell you something.

113
00:12:00.511 --> 00:12:01.671
if I ever find this guy...

114
00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:04.758
Hey. don't start
thinking like that.

115
00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:06.798
You're gonna get yourself
in a lot of trouble.

116
00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:08.412
I don't wanna argue about this.

117
00:12:08.436 --> 00:12:11.269
- Your brother got...
- Someone has to pay

118
00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:13.813
for what they did to tien.

119
00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:15.169
Your brother knew
what he was doing

120
00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:16.337
when he got himself
involved in that...

121
00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:17.396
You don't get it!

122
00:12:18.947 --> 00:12:20.608
It wasn't an accident.

123
00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:24.899
They killed my brother
in cold blood.

124
00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.616
They killed my family.

125
00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:35.202
And what do you plan on
doing about it?

126
00:12:40.426 --> 00:12:42.291
As a matter of fact. a lot.

127
00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:44.968
And I'll do it by myself.
if I have to.

128
00:12:45.682 --> 00:12:47.718
if no one else is gonna help me.

129
00:12:50.853 --> 00:12:52.263
Midnight squad.

130
00:12:54.357 --> 00:12:55.597
What?

131
00:12:56.985 --> 00:13:02.946
Midnight squad. it's an elite
underground racing team.

132
00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:05.524
Bunch of thugs.

133
00:13:06.452 --> 00:13:09.785
Famous around here for
a dangerous combination

134
00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:14.825
of high speed racing
and crazy riding styles.

135
00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:20.250
You're looking for a
man named cobra.

136
00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:36.262
Did you see tien's body?

137
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:41.069
Yeah.

138
00:13:44.615 --> 00:13:45.650
What did they do?

139
00:13:48.077 --> 00:13:49.362
You don't wanna know.

140
00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:03.377
If this city has to burn.
then so be it.

141
00:15:23.714 --> 00:15:27.002
I haven't been practicing.

142
00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:31.002
You younger generations.

143
00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.341
you need to keep the
traditions alive.

144
00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:36.136
Even though we live in America.

145
00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:38.760
we must not forget our roots.

146
00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:41.721
Yes.

147
00:15:46.195 --> 00:15:47.195
Good.

148
00:15:49.031 --> 00:15:50.487
How was California?

149
00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:52.732
It was peaceful.

150
00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.411
I had to come back. though.

151
00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.246
I think you know why.

152
00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.240
We know about tien.

153
00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:03.747
I'm assuming that's
why you're here.

154
00:16:05.173 --> 00:16:06.504
Mm.

155
00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:10.049
How'd it happen?

156
00:16:10.052 --> 00:16:12.043
Word on the street is that
he got involved

157
00:16:12.221 --> 00:16:14.007
in underground street racing.

158
00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:16.719
Deals went sour.
things went south.

159
00:16:17.894 --> 00:16:19.259
Midnight squad. right?

160
00:16:19.437 --> 00:16:20.437
I heard. too.

161
00:16:22.231 --> 00:16:23.937
You guys know anything else?

162
00:16:24.108 --> 00:16:28.602
Shen. I understand.
you are feeling

163
00:16:28.779 --> 00:16:30.440
very emotional now... emotional.

164
00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:34.449
People keep on saying
that word. all right?

165
00:16:35.828 --> 00:16:38.820
The fact is. you're supposed

166
00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:40.738
to take care of my
little brother.

167
00:16:47.256 --> 00:16:50.248
The ang soon tiong
benevolent association

168
00:16:50.426 --> 00:16:53.042
has no such dealings in
such matters.

169
00:16:53.221 --> 00:16:56.554
We are merely here to
provide essential services

170
00:16:56.724 --> 00:16:57.759
for the community.

171
00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:01.092
I used to work for you.

172
00:17:01.354 --> 00:17:04.687
so I know you have your fingers

173
00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:06.768
in everything that's illegal.
okay?

174
00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:13.275
My question is. do you
have a finger in this?

175
00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:17.984
Do you?

176
00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:22.865
Our condolences for your
family. for your loss.

177
00:17:24.126 --> 00:17:26.117
You answer me!

178
00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:29.036
You answer me.

179
00:17:35.304 --> 00:17:38.091
We understand he was
the last of your family.

180
00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:42.642
Come. light a candle for tien.

181
00:17:44.897 --> 00:17:46.103
Family.

182
00:17:53.155 --> 00:17:55.146
You people know nothing
about family.

183
00:18:44.373 --> 00:18:48.241
Welcome to the land of

185
00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:06.226
A man walks into a club.
wants to turn the heat up.

186
00:19:06.771 --> 00:19:11.140
Tell me. stranger. do you
bring me sake.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.437
gifts. cash. or danger?

188
00:19:15.237 --> 00:19:17.353
I'm just looking for
some information.

189
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:21.983

Chinese dragon.

193
00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:32.627
But when the dragon
walks into my land.

194
00:19:32.838 --> 00:19:36.330
he becomes the
creation of my hand.

195
00:19:37.385 --> 00:19:38.750

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:52.855
she races with her
dangerous stares.

200
00:19:55.778 --> 00:19:58.645
Unless you want to die
in the burning flame.

201
00:20:02.702 --> 00:20:04.238

- These guys are packing.
- No. I wanna talk to them.

206
00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:31.519
You go within 10 feet of them.
your ass will get dropped.

207
00:20:38.696 --> 00:20:42.780
The name of the game is race

208
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:46.488

wide space.

That's a bike?

225
00:22:31.559 --> 00:22:32.559
Yeah.

226
00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:34.349
Does it move?

227
00:22:35.437 --> 00:22:39.396
Look. it's specifically
prepped for modifications.

228
00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:41.732
I don't do that cookie
cutter bullshit.

229
00:22:42.695 --> 00:22:44.175
She'll be anything you
want her to be.

230
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.611
Ti need her to be fast.

231
00:22:46.699 --> 00:22:49.031

If you buy her tonight.

I'll throw in some gear for you.

238
00:23:06.594 --> 00:23:09.336
But you can't be driving out
of here looking like a squid.

239
00:23:10.639 --> 00:23:12.639
Besides. if you hit the
pavement looking like that.

240
00:23:12.683 --> 00:23:14.173
you're Sushi. my friend.

241
00:23:19.481 --> 00:23:21.187
I'm not Japanese.

242
00:23:24.987 --> 00:23:27.569
Not Japanese.

243
00:24:37.685 --> 00:24:45.558
A little boy left with a
plan returns with a bike!

244
00:24:46.819 --> 00:24:50.027
Becomes a man.

We call this a tin
can over here.

250
00:25:07.965 --> 00:25:10.126
This ain't nothing until
you work on it.

251
00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:11.585
What?

252
00:25:12.094 --> 00:25:13.504
What do I do?

253
00:25:17.016 --> 00:25:18.802
Replace the
suspension components.

254
00:25:18.976 --> 00:25:21.513

traction. right?

255
00:25:22.021 --> 00:25:25.309
Look. look. drop it so
it gets more traction.

00:25:25.482 --> 00:25:29.771
extend the swing arms.
get some new wheels.

257
00:25:30.779 --> 00:25:33.486
If you can't do that. you
might wanna get a new life.

258
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.485
- Right?
- Yes!

259
00:25:40.998 --> 00:25:42.078
Okay.

260
00:25:42.082 --> 00:25:43.538
After that. when can I race?

261
00:25:45.002 --> 00:25:47.539
You gotta be initiated in
the club. man.

262
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:49.899
What does it take
to be initiated...

263
00:25:49.923 --> 00:25:51.379
Shh.

264
00:25:52.593 --> 00:25:54.800
Here. here. here. here. here.

You're so nervous.

Come with me.

267
00:26:13.864 --> 00:26:16.071
Smack talk and hustle.

268
00:26:16.075 --> 00:26:18.657
You need the bets and
the muscles.

269
00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:21.026
If you can't hold the heat.

270
00:26:21.288 --> 00:26:23.028
shouldn't be on the seat.

271
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:28.166
All right.

272
00:26:28.337 --> 00:26:30.703
Wanna fight. I'll fight.

273
00:26:30.714 --> 00:26:34.548
Clear the ring. this boy

All right. Asian baby boy.

275
00:26:41.141 --> 00:26:42.597
See if you don't hit

Go. go!

That's how we do it
in the streets!

281
00:27:12.548 --> 00:27:13.833
Let's go.

282
00:27:16.552 --> 00:27:17.837

Ladies and gentlemen. I
think I found a new toy.

290
00:28:18.322 --> 00:28:19.732
You did.

291
00:28:23.493 --> 00:28:26.860
Look at me. that was a
good adjustment.

292
00:28:28.832 --> 00:28:30.572
Where'd you learn how to
fight like that?

293
00:28:33.378 --> 00:28:34.709
On the streets.

294
00:28:36.131 --> 00:28:38.497
Well. he earned his colors.
right?

295
00:28:39.218 --> 00:28:41.254
All you need is a tag now.

296
00:28:44.139 --> 00:28:45.470
The dude in the game.

297
00:28:46.934 --> 00:28:47.934
Ghost.

00:28:49.519 --> 00:28:53.888
- No. no. no. no.

299
00:28:54.775 --> 00:28:57.812
Look for the fake.

00:28:57.986 --> 00:29:00.523
You'll find where we will be.

301
00:29:00.948 --> 00:29:03.530
Bring your bike.

302
00:29:04.785 --> 00:29:06.946

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:12.331
Fight like cat with wild punch.

304
00:29:14.878 --> 00:29:16.163

Don't forget to get
your bike modded.

308
00:29:23.095 --> 00:29:24.585
Wait. modded?

309
00:29:24.763 --> 00:29:25.763

All right. new guy.

315
00:29:54.668 --> 00:29:55.783
Andromeda.

316
00:29:59.673 --> 00:30:00.879
Tek.

317
00:30:23.947 --> 00:30:25.062
Hello?

318
00:30:28.702 --> 00:30:29.862
Andromeda?

319
00:30:30.078 --> 00:30:32.285
I don't go by that name anymore.

320
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.120
What do you want?

321
00:30:42.883 --> 00:30:43.918
I need a tune-up.

322
00:30:45.719 --> 00:30:46.719
Where's your bike?

323
00:30:47.137 --> 00:30:48.217
Outside.

00:30:51.141 --> 00:30:52.631
Well. bring it in then.

325
00:30:54.061 --> 00:30:55.301
Ti hate the sun.

326

A stock bike?

327
00:31:37.104 --> 00:31:38.685
Yeah. how much is it gonna cost?

328
00:31:38.855 --> 00:31:40.345
I need to get it
drag race ready.

329
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:44.896
Well. you're gonna need
a lot of work.

330
00:31:46.196 --> 00:31:48.778
I can do whatever your
budget calls for.

331
00:31:50.409 --> 00:31:51.865
Who you gonna race. anyways?

332
00:31:54.246 --> 00:31:56.953
Cobra of midnight squad.

333
00:32:01.336 --> 00:32:03.122
Well. you can dream on.

334
00:32:04.131 --> 00:32:08.374
Yeah. you're gonna take
down cobra's bike. right on.

335
00:32:08.552 --> 00:32:11.965
Just remember. cobra
doesn't race amateurs.

336
00:32:14.141 --> 00:32:15.972
I'm told you can help.

337
00:32:16.268 --> 00:32:17.508
Is that not true?

338
00:32:17.519 --> 00:32:21.011
Oh. I know cobra"s bike. yeah.

339
00:32:21.273 --> 00:32:24.731
It's just gonna take a lot
to get this into shape.

340
00:32:32.576 --> 00:32:33.691
Right.

341
00:32:35.454 --> 00:32:37.490
You were part of the
midnight squad. huh?

342
00:32:37.873 --> 00:32:38.988
What was that like?

343
00:32:42.627 --> 00:32:44.913
Yeah. I used to be one of them.

344
00:32:46.381 --> 00:32:48.167
but I learned how to
keep my mouth shut

345
00:32:48.383 --> 00:32:50.499
about their operations and code.

346
00:32:51.553 --> 00:32:54.010
How do you think I'm
still alive today?

347
00:32:55.474 --> 00:32:57.180
Is that what killed my brother?

348
00:32:58.226 --> 00:33:00.592
Don't drag me into this.

349
00:33:01.062 --> 00:33:02.927
I got nothing to do with it.

350
00:33:03.106 --> 00:33:05.267
Then get my bike in
shape for the race.

351
00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:12.490
60.

352
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:14.944
Hundred?

353
00:33:15.285 --> 00:33:18.777
Thousand.

354
00:33:19.331 --> 00:33:20.411
What?

355
00:33:21.917 --> 00:33:26.957
Well. cobra's bike alone
is worth over 100 grand.

356
00:33:27.589 --> 00:33:29.420
and if all you wanna do is race.

357
00:33:30.008 --> 00:33:32.545
I can do the minimum to
keep up with his bike.

358
00:33:32.719 --> 00:33:36.382
and the rest is all on you.

359
00:33:38.141 --> 00:33:39.677
Why so expensive?

360
00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:48.981
You gotta do the basics.

361
00:33:50.487 --> 00:33:52.978
Extend the swing arms and
drop the bike.

362
00:33:53.907 --> 00:33:55.192
What do those do?

363
00:33:58.662 --> 00:34:00.903
Extending your swing
arms minimize

364
00:34:01.081 --> 00:34:02.867
your chance of doing a wheelie.

365
00:34:03.124 --> 00:34:05.410
You want all your wheels
on the ground.

366
00:34:06.169 --> 00:34:09.286
The first 60 feet on takeoff
are the most crucial ones.

367
00:34:09.548 --> 00:34:13.006
The goal is to get this
450-pound bike

368
00:34:13.176 --> 00:34:16.464
moving forward as
quickly as possible.

369
00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:22.007
You need a fuel system for
quicker throttle response.

370
00:34:23.687 --> 00:34:26.053
Your suspension needs
to be lowered

371
00:34:26.231 --> 00:34:29.018
for hunkered down
traction. enhancing stance.

372
00:34:29.985 --> 00:34:35.105
And now. oh yeah.

373
00:34:38.994 --> 00:34:41.451
we need to get you an
air shifter kit.

374
00:34:41.746 --> 00:34:43.907
Cut out your left turn
signal switch

375
00:34:44.082 --> 00:34:46.118
and turn it into a button
that transmits

376
00:34:46.293 --> 00:34:48.830
a signal to a solenoid.

377
00:34:49.004 --> 00:34:50.619
Solenoid?

378
00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:52.370
Yeah. it kills engine ignition.

379
00:34:52.549 --> 00:34:54.540
It fires 120 psi of
compressed air

380
00:34:54.718 --> 00:34:56.709
to kick the transmission
to the next gear.

381
00:34:58.179 --> 00:34:58.884
Right.

382
00:34:59.055 --> 00:35:00.295
Why wouldn't I know that?

383
00:35:00.724 --> 00:35:02.680
Yeah. and that's
just the basics.

384
00:35:02.851 --> 00:35:07.720
So. if you ever wanted to
impress cobra. by the way.

385
00:35:07.897 --> 00:35:11.185
keep in mind that he doesn't
race for less than 50 grand.

386
00:35:11.359 --> 00:35:12.895
so you better have the Greens.

387
00:35:13.361 --> 00:35:14.567
If you wanna race him.

388
00:35:16.114 --> 00:35:17.900
Yeah. let's do it.

389
00:35:21.161 --> 00:35:22.161
Half up front.

390
00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:24.695
I'll have the rest by tomorrow.

391
00:35:25.957 --> 00:35:28.198
That will just get your
bike stripped down.

392
00:35:30.587 --> 00:35:33.920
Well then. you have my word.

393
00:35:35.842 --> 00:35:37.378
You're not here by
tomorrow night.

394
00:35:38.011 --> 00:35:39.876
I'm selling your bike in parts.

395
00:35:47.771 --> 00:35:49.386
He was there again last night.

396
00:35:51.149 --> 00:35:52.605
What was he doing there?

397
00:35:53.443 --> 00:35:56.185
Word on the street is he
wants a race with cobra.

398
00:35:57.072 --> 00:35:58.608
Even got himself a new bike.

399
00:35:58.865 --> 00:36:00.446
He must be insane.

400
00:36:00.825 --> 00:36:03.111
Still trying to find out
who killed tien. is he?

401
00:36:04.412 --> 00:36:05.822
He took an initiation rite.

402
00:36:06.956 --> 00:36:09.197
Beat the guy to a pulp
before the cops could come.

403
00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:14.206
I remember.

404
00:36:16.383 --> 00:36:18.965
Where did he train. with Manny?

405
00:36:26.059 --> 00:36:28.266
Shen is not going to
stop at this.

406
00:36:29.479 --> 00:36:32.266
Perhaps it's time we give
him a little warning.

407
00:36:33.817 --> 00:36:34.817
Leave it to me.

408
00:36:35.777 --> 00:36:37.233
How many of our guys can I take?

409
00:36:38.113 --> 00:36:39.228
Just take two.

410
00:36:40.407 --> 00:36:42.739
I don't want to alarm
him or the rival gangs

411
00:36:42.909 --> 00:36:44.365
that something is on.

412
00:36:45.537 --> 00:36:48.028
They're just waiting
for us to be distracted.

413
00:36:48.498 --> 00:36:49.863
Ti know where to find him.

414
00:36:58.425 --> 00:37:00.461
Go. take care of it.

415
00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:18.110
Hello?

416
00:37:18.361 --> 00:37:19.521
Cynthia. it's shen.

417
00:37:20.822 --> 00:37:23.313
Jesus. shen. it's one am.

418
00:37:23.867 --> 00:37:24.867
This about work?

419
00:37:25.577 --> 00:37:27.613
Yeah. I wanna talk about
selling my house.

420
00:37:29.247 --> 00:37:30.077
Just call me tomorrow-

421
00:37:30.248 --> 00:37:32.239
no. no. no. no. it's urgent.

422
00:37:33.334 --> 00:37:34.824
That can wait tomorrow.

423
00:37:34.836 --> 00:37:40.251
Cynthia. I need cash like
right now. like fast.

424
00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:43.041
You don't sell
a house overnight. shen.

425
00:37:43.219 --> 00:37:43.878
You know that.

426
00:37:44.053 --> 00:37:45.793
What if I'm asking for 150k?

427
00:37:46.181 --> 00:37:47.466
I just need it in cash.

428
00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:51.007
Shen. your
house is at least 320.

429
00:37:51.186 --> 00:37:52.266
Ti know.

430
00:37:52.437 --> 00:37:55.429
But whoever wants it
right now. 150k.

431
00:37:55.774 --> 00:37:57.355
I just need it by noon tomorrow.

432
00:37:57.734 --> 00:37:58.734
Please.

433
00:37:59.778 --> 00:38:01.338
Who has that
kind of cash laying around?

434
00:38:01.362 --> 00:38:02.362
Don't you?

435
00:38:03.782 --> 00:38:06.740
Those are deposits
and company assets. shen.

436
00:38:07.118 --> 00:38:08.233
I can't.

437
00:38:08.411 --> 00:38:13.030
Well. if you buy it. then
that's a kind of profit

438
00:38:13.208 --> 00:38:14.539
you're never gonna see again.

439
00:38:15.502 --> 00:38:17.493
This is what you've
been waiting for. right?

440
00:38:20.423 --> 00:38:22.755
I will wire the money tomorrow.

441
00:38:24.385 --> 00:38:27.092
All right. I'm sending you
the wire info right now.

442
00:38:27.597 --> 00:38:28.757
And shen?

443
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:30.390
Yeah?

444
00:38:31.601 --> 00:38:33.412
You're not getting
into any problems. are you?

445
00:38:33.436 --> 00:38:34.436
Dangerous shit?

446
00:38:49.035 --> 00:38:50.366
Hey. I got you the money.

447
00:38:51.412 --> 00:38:52.412
I know.

448
00:38:52.997 --> 00:38:55.409
I already placed the
orders for some parts.

449
00:38:55.834 --> 00:38:58.701
Gonna be working on your
exhaust first while I'm waiting.

450
00:38:59.838 --> 00:39:01.499
How long is it gonna take?

451
00:39:02.757 --> 00:39:07.376
My. my. you're an impatient
one. now. aren't you?

452
00:39:08.012 --> 00:39:12.346
Look. half of the race
is how good the bike is.

453
00:39:12.517 --> 00:39:17.932
Now. the other half is
how good the rider is.

454
00:39:18.356 --> 00:39:21.098
Do you even have the
skills to beat cobra?

455
00:39:26.281 --> 00:39:27.566
I ain't got no choice.

456
00:39:28.449 --> 00:39:30.314
For some vendetta. right?

457
00:39:32.579 --> 00:39:35.912
They killed my brother.
so. yeah. you got it right.

458
00:39:36.082 --> 00:39:37.413
Yeah. I remember.

459
00:39:37.792 --> 00:39:38.792
Typical.

460
00:39:39.419 --> 00:39:41.034
And I'm not surprised.

461
00:39:42.505 --> 00:39:44.837
It's all fun and games for you.
huh?

462
00:39:46.968 --> 00:39:50.460
Tell me. are they part
of the triads?

463
00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:57.350
Look. I already told you.
I like staying alive.

464
00:39:57.979 --> 00:39:59.640
so you're getting
nothing out of me.

465
00:40:04.736 --> 00:40:06.476
Whatever it takes.

466
00:40:16.331 --> 00:40:18.287
How bad do you wanna beat him?

467
00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:20.456
With everything I got.

468
00:40:22.462 --> 00:40:24.919
All right. well then go out

469
00:40:24.923 --> 00:40:28.666
and get yourself a inca 500.

470
00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.216
They're less menacing machines.

471
00:40:31.429 --> 00:40:36.048
Come back. and I'll
show you a thing or two.

472
00:40:36.517 --> 00:40:38.473
And get one for three grand.

473
00:40:38.645 --> 00:40:41.682
That'll be like your
kiddie training wheels.

474
00:40:41.856 --> 00:40:43.721
Are you saying
you're helping me?

475
00:40:44.651 --> 00:40:48.519
Oh. if that'll mean an extra
five grand. yeah. yeah.

476
00:40:50.782 --> 00:40:52.943
You don't come cheap. do you?

477
00:40:52.951 --> 00:40:55.112
Gotta pay the bills. boy!

478
00:40:58.957 --> 00:41:00.663
Thank you. Andromeda.

479
00:41:01.501 --> 00:41:02.991
I really need it.

480
00:41:04.796 --> 00:41:06.206
It's tek.

481
00:41:06.547 --> 00:41:08.458
Don't call me Andromeda.

482
00:41:13.513 --> 00:41:14.513
If you say so.

483
00:41:28.111 --> 00:41:31.023
Sir. I wasn't
expecting you today.

484
00:41:31.197 --> 00:41:33.108
Please. step inside.

485
00:41:33.324 --> 00:41:34.655
The captain has not left yet.

486
00:41:46.587 --> 00:41:47.793
Mr. Chang.

487
00:41:54.721 --> 00:41:56.086
How are you. Doug?

488
00:41:57.598 --> 00:41:59.589
Same shit. different day.

489
00:42:02.186 --> 00:42:04.768
I am here on concern
of a matter.

490
00:42:05.648 --> 00:42:07.764
You must've heard
about shen long?

491
00:42:08.985 --> 00:42:11.897
Seems he is making some
noise on the streets.

492
00:42:14.115 --> 00:42:17.949
He actually stopped by
the precinct.

493
00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:20.120
Stopped here?

494
00:42:21.622 --> 00:42:24.739
Yeah. he asked about
his brother.

495
00:42:24.917 --> 00:42:27.909
Well. we both know
he's deceased.

496
00:42:28.171 --> 00:42:30.002
Unfortunate situation.

497
00:42:31.049 --> 00:42:32.334
And what did you say to him?

498
00:42:32.675 --> 00:42:34.711
I told him to get the
fuck out of here.

499
00:42:35.386 --> 00:42:39.299
Ah. no wonder he's
causing problems.

500
00:42:40.683 --> 00:42:43.516
making it his mission to
take on the midnight squad.

501
00:42:46.189 --> 00:42:47.349
We'll see.

502
00:42:47.982 --> 00:42:51.315
Doug. you know I
can't have that.

503
00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:55.528
The races are very
important for business.

504
00:42:57.617 --> 00:43:00.984
Technically. I can't stop him.

505
00:43:01.287 --> 00:43:03.152
He hasn't broken any laws.

506
00:43:16.094 --> 00:43:20.633
The races are key to
cleaning the money.

507
00:43:21.265 --> 00:43:22.801
I know this. Mr. Chang.

508
00:43:28.815 --> 00:43:30.476
Shen long's little vendetta

509
00:43:31.818 --> 00:43:33.809
is going to draw too
much attention.

510
00:43:34.403 --> 00:43:36.689
Secrecy is of the
utmost importance.

511
00:43:37.073 --> 00:43:38.358
So what do you want me to do?

512
00:43:39.117 --> 00:43:43.235
Well. we are going to
teach him a little lesson.

513
00:43:44.247 --> 00:43:47.705
I just need for you to make
sure your men do not interfere.

514
00:43:49.836 --> 00:43:51.622
My men are pretty busy.

515
00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:55.500
Good.

516
00:44:10.648 --> 00:44:12.104
Gym's closed right now.

517
00:44:19.907 --> 00:44:21.443
You guys look familiar.

518
00:44:22.702 --> 00:44:23.702
We haven't met.

519
00:44:29.876 --> 00:44:32.288
But you might've seen me
with lucid Lucy and the boys.

520
00:44:34.088 --> 00:44:35.088
That's right.

521
00:44:36.382 --> 00:44:38.122
There were a lot of
people there.

522
00:44:40.011 --> 00:44:41.922
Doesn't look like you
guys are gonna train.

523
00:44:42.263 --> 00:44:45.346
No. just a chat.

524
00:44:46.267 --> 00:44:50.351
How friendly it is. well.
that depends on you.

525
00:44:53.149 --> 00:44:55.140
I see Chang sent his lapdog.

526
00:44:56.402 --> 00:44:58.267
That is how the triads
work. right?

527
00:44:58.446 --> 00:45:03.531
Now. shen. we are a
benevolent society.

528
00:45:05.203 --> 00:45:07.319
You know we don't like to
be called that.

529
00:45:07.788 --> 00:45:09.119
Ti should know that.

530
00:45:09.957 --> 00:45:12.699
I grew up with them
before you were even born.

531
00:45:17.173 --> 00:45:18.288
Go home. shen.

532
00:45:19.425 --> 00:45:21.336
We don't need you
causing trouble here.

533
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:29.799
You see. I can't do that.

534
00:45:30.853 --> 00:45:33.686
Hell. I have no home to go to.

535
00:45:35.775 --> 00:45:38.187
Well. we don't like
causing trouble.

536
00:45:38.945 --> 00:45:43.735
But you. you're a bull
in a China shop.

537
00:45:44.742 --> 00:45:48.030
Then give me the man
who killed my brother.

538
00:45:48.955 --> 00:45:50.491
Which I know you can.

539
00:45:51.832 --> 00:45:59.546
Well. you know we had
nothing to do with that.

540
00:47:20.338 --> 00:47:23.876
Like I already said. how
friendly this chat is.

541
00:47:24.342 --> 00:47:25.627
it's up to you.

542
00:47:28.721 --> 00:47:30.632
Let's get a little bit
friendlier then.

543
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:58.281
Go home.

544
00:48:08.719 --> 00:48:10.459
You can't stop. can you?

545
00:48:13.099 --> 00:48:14.839
You're just like your brother.

546
00:49:35.014 --> 00:49:37.380
How could you let shen
embarrass us like this?

547
00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:39.556
I was holding back.

548
00:49:39.894 --> 00:49:41.725
I would have killed him
if you'd let me.

549
00:49:41.979 --> 00:49:43.264
Let me take the guns and...

550
00:49:43.439 --> 00:49:44.554
Guns?

551
00:49:44.565 --> 00:49:46.647
Huh. what are you gonna do?

552
00:49:47.026 --> 00:49:48.061
Wake up the whole city?

553
00:49:48.235 --> 00:49:51.523
Shen's only advantage
is that he won't stop

554
00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:53.020
until he's dead.

555
00:49:53.449 --> 00:49:55.531
The captain has already
done us a huge favor

556
00:49:55.784 --> 00:49:57.024
by turning his head.

557
00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:00.827
You use guns. wake the city up.

558
00:50:01.248 --> 00:50:02.579
not even he can help us.

559
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:04.081
Then give me more men.

560
00:50:05.211 --> 00:50:07.076
The thing about shen is

561
00:50:07.087 --> 00:50:09.078
we can't threaten him
with anything.

562
00:50:09.256 --> 00:50:11.497
He's got no family.
he's got nothing.

563
00:50:11.509 --> 00:50:14.592
He can't be reasoned with.
he can't be blackmailed.

564
00:50:15.054 --> 00:50:16.294
He's got nothing.

565
00:50:18.098 --> 00:50:20.305
Except for his revenge on cobra.

566
00:50:46.544 --> 00:50:51.083
Strange. his bike wasn't
with him or parked anywhere.

567
00:50:53.092 --> 00:50:54.423
Precisely.

568
00:50:55.135 --> 00:50:56.796
It's precious to him.

569
00:50:56.971 --> 00:50:59.087
Have some our boys keep an
eye out for it.

570
00:50:59.265 --> 00:51:01.051
Yes. destroy it.

571
00:51:03.561 --> 00:51:05.472
He will never ride again.

572
00:51:06.188 --> 00:51:10.101
Bring me his fingers.
all of them.

573
00:51:49.565 --> 00:51:52.056
Hey. boy. bike's ready.

574
00:51:59.033 --> 00:52:02.742
You look like shit.
=I feel like a truck hit me.

575
00:52:03.704 --> 00:52:06.571
Usually bikers say that
when they have their bike.

576
00:52:09.209 --> 00:52:10.324
Let's see it.

577
00:52:10.502 --> 00:52:12.083
Whazzup?

578
00:52:12.379 --> 00:52:13.994
Woo!

579
00:52:14.214 --> 00:52:15.579
Bam.

580
00:52:18.052 --> 00:52:19.167
Looks the same.

581
00:52:21.805 --> 00:52:24.888
Never let someone know how
powerful your bike really is.

582
00:52:25.184 --> 00:52:27.596
Here's your custom
clutch mod here.

583
00:52:27.811 --> 00:52:31.178
I disabled the back-torque
limiting slipper assembly.

584
00:52:31.732 --> 00:52:32.938
What's that?

585
00:52:33.275 --> 00:52:36.392
All right. try to launch
from a dead stop

586
00:52:36.654 --> 00:52:39.145
and your bike will go
into a hammering effect.

587
00:52:39.406 --> 00:52:40.691
Putting so much level pressure

588
00:52:40.699 --> 00:52:43.156
will just make it go pah!

589
00:52:44.203 --> 00:52:45.203
Sweet.

590
00:52:46.705 --> 00:52:48.892
The more money I spend on it.
the more dangerous it is. huh?

591
00:52:48.916 --> 00:52:50.201
That's what it feels like.

592
00:52:50.376 --> 00:52:53.539
Yeah. well. racing
ain't for the weak.

593
00:52:55.381 --> 00:52:57.167
Got the dog bones to handle

594
00:52:57.424 --> 00:52:59.631
the chores in the
rear of the bike.

595
00:53:00.594 --> 00:53:02.209
Yep. I lowered it.

596
00:53:02.596 --> 00:53:04.837
General rule is one-tenth
per second decrease

597
00:53:05.099 --> 00:53:06.635
in the quarter mile is possible

598
00:53:06.892 --> 00:53:09.725
for each inch that the
bike is lowered.

599
00:53:10.646 --> 00:53:12.932
Can I even ride this
thing normally anymore?

600
00:53:13.607 --> 00:53:16.724
Just watch out for the road
speed bumps. all right?

601
00:53:17.319 --> 00:53:19.275
And. by the way. a slammed bike

602
00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:22.192
is much better than the
ones up in the air. right?

603
00:53:22.449 --> 00:53:23.234
True story.

604
00:53:23.409 --> 00:53:24.649
There you go.

605
00:53:25.411 --> 00:53:29.745
You're gonna fly to
neverland with this sucker.

606
00:53:30.332 --> 00:53:31.367
Yeah.

607
00:53:34.712 --> 00:53:35.952
You ready?

608
00:53:36.130 --> 00:53:37.961
Come on. hop on.

609
00:53:52.312 --> 00:53:53.312
Feels good.

610
00:53:54.106 --> 00:53:56.313
Seriously. what did you do?

611
00:53:57.359 --> 00:53:58.519
- Hmm?
- Nothing.

612
00:53:58.694 --> 00:53:59.809
- Nothing.
- I'm good.

613
00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:02.778
I got in a fight.
but it'll heal.

614
00:54:02.781 --> 00:54:06.319
- It's just a bruise.
- Yeah. what is that?

615
00:54:06.493 --> 00:54:08.199
- Back to this.
- Oh. wow.

616
00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:10.452
Bruises don't bleed. so.

617
00:54:10.873 --> 00:54:12.909
Yeah. Yeah.

618
00:54:13.125 --> 00:54:14.205
I'll be okay. =-mm hmm.

619
00:54:15.836 --> 00:54:18.999
That is the worst stitch I
have ever seen.

620
00:54:20.507 --> 00:54:21.507
Thank you.

621
00:54:41.528 --> 00:54:43.564
I hope Mr. Chang
knows you're here.

622
00:54:43.781 --> 00:54:45.237
Hey. Manny.

623
00:54:46.158 --> 00:54:47.568
We're here looking for shen.

624
00:54:48.786 --> 00:54:50.367
He's not here.

625
00:54:50.621 --> 00:54:51.906
Then I guess
you won't mind if we

626
00:54:51.914 --> 00:54:53.324
take a look around now.
will you?

627
00:54:53.957 --> 00:54:55.743
Mr. Chang and I have an
understanding.

628
00:54:55.918 --> 00:54:57.033
We go way back.

629
00:54:57.211 --> 00:54:58.872
We have a gentleman's agreement.

630
00:55:00.589 --> 00:55:03.752
The dragon head gave me specific
orders to look for shen.

631
00:55:03.967 --> 00:55:06.128
Now. excuse me. while I
do what I'm told.

632
00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:11.505
He knows I'm good for my word.

633
00:55:12.726 --> 00:55:14.182
Then tell us where he is.

634
00:55:17.356 --> 00:55:18.971
Didn't Mr. Chang ever
teach you guys

635
00:55:19.149 --> 00:55:20.889
how to respect your elders?

636
00:55:21.068 --> 00:55:22.068
Do you know who I am?

637
00:55:22.152 --> 00:55:24.313
I don't really give a
shit who you are.

638
00:55:38.669 --> 00:55:39.909
You're getting old. Manny.

639
00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:41.160
Oh yeah.

640
00:55:52.474 --> 00:55:53.474
Stay down.

641
00:55:54.476 --> 00:55:56.387
The dragon head will
hear about this.

642
00:55:56.687 --> 00:55:58.097
I don't think so.

643
00:55:58.772 --> 00:56:01.229
If he finds out you guys
are here messing up shit.

644
00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:03.811
you're the ones who are
gonna be punished.

645
00:56:06.613 --> 00:56:09.320
Fine. nothing happened.

646
00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:20.832
It's like we were never here!

647
00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:22.830
Go home.

648
00:56:23.797 --> 00:56:25.378
You punks act like you
own the world.

649
00:56:25.382 --> 00:56:26.838
you've never even seen it.

650
00:56:34.892 --> 00:56:38.476
You have to start from the
smallest edge of the wound

651
00:56:39.313 --> 00:56:41.850
so it can slowly close up.

652
00:56:44.401 --> 00:56:48.485
Diagonal path across here.

653
00:56:50.490 --> 00:56:51.490
There.

654
00:56:56.663 --> 00:56:57.663
Thank you.

655
00:57:00.667 --> 00:57:02.999
How did you get it from.
anyways?

656
00:57:04.504 --> 00:57:05.504
A fight.

657
00:57:06.757 --> 00:57:08.372
You got it at the sprints?

658
00:57:09.635 --> 00:57:10.635
The sprints?

659
00:57:11.261 --> 00:57:13.468
Yeah. where the drag races are.

660
00:57:13.764 --> 00:57:14.844
No. no. no.

661
00:57:15.766 --> 00:57:17.506
A feud with the triads.

662
00:57:18.936 --> 00:57:20.096
Probably cobra.

663
00:57:21.647 --> 00:57:23.262
Well. I could've told you that.

664
00:57:23.523 --> 00:57:25.980
- There. tight as a virgin!
- 0oh. fuck.

665
00:57:30.238 --> 00:57:32.320
You know. I used to grow
up in that world.

666
00:57:32.658 --> 00:57:34.740
It's crazy. now I'm gonna
take them down.

667
00:57:36.370 --> 00:57:38.452
That's impossible. and
you know that.

668
00:57:43.168 --> 00:57:47.457
Well. I'm gonna try. anyways.

669
00:57:51.176 --> 00:57:54.418
Hey. you didn't get the
training bike. did you?

670
00:57:56.348 --> 00:57:59.966
Oh. since you're always
ready to jump

671
00:57:59.977 --> 00:58:01.433
into the heat of things.

672
00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:05.562
what's say you try your
baby out. huh?

673
00:58:10.696 --> 00:58:11.696
Hmm?

674
00:58:13.115 --> 00:58:15.481
All right. the basic theory.

675
00:58:15.659 --> 00:58:19.117
clutch. throttle. shifter.
then brakes.

676
00:58:19.955 --> 00:58:20.955
Gotta burnout.

677
00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:22.790
Okay.

678
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:24.000
Whats' a burnout?

679
00:58:26.753 --> 00:58:28.789
A burnout is when
your bike tires

680
00:58:28.964 --> 00:58:31.956
dig deep into the road
for a maximum traction.

681
00:58:32.175 --> 00:58:34.587
But remember the first
60 feet rule.

682
00:58:35.178 --> 00:58:36.793
That's where you want to lead.

683
00:58:38.223 --> 00:58:42.091
Oh. god. keep the front
brake on. and rev the engine.

684
00:58:42.269 --> 00:58:42.803
Okay.

685
00:58:42.978 --> 00:58:44.263
Slip the clutch.

686
00:58:48.734 --> 00:58:50.565
All right. rock the bike
back and forth.

687
00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:59.157
Spread it through the
tires. go on.

688
00:59:00.037 --> 00:59:03.120
Keep the rpm between
4.500 and 5.500.

689
00:59:04.041 --> 00:59:05.326
Good. all right.

690
00:59:05.542 --> 00:59:07.703
Go ahead. try a launch. go.

691
00:59:09.171 --> 00:59:10.536
The fuck?

692
00:59:10.714 --> 00:59:12.545
I can't even get to second gear.

693
00:59:12.758 --> 00:59:14.840
Nope. the bike picks up too fast

694
00:59:15.010 --> 00:59:17.126
before your legs can
even go to the shifter.

695
00:59:17.763 --> 00:59:18.763
Try air shift.

696
00:59:18.805 --> 00:59:20.545
- What. what?
- Oh my god.

697
00:59:21.558 --> 00:59:24.095
The left turn signal. dumb-ass.

698
00:59:24.644 --> 00:59:26.134
Left turn? =yep.

699
00:59:26.313 --> 00:59:29.180
Yep. that button is now your
shifter to change gears.

700
00:59:29.858 --> 00:59:31.189
What about signaling?

701
00:59:32.861 --> 00:59:34.146
Are you serious?

702
00:59:35.072 --> 00:59:37.984
You're drag racing. not turning
left to grandma's house.

703
00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:40.612
Now go ahead. go. try again.

704
00:59:43.830 --> 00:59:44.945
Yep.

705
00:59:46.833 --> 00:59:48.118
Woo hoo!

706
01:00:08.313 --> 01:00:09.598
What'd you think?

707
01:00:11.733 --> 01:00:14.349
Woo. I feel lightheaded.

708
01:00:14.694 --> 01:00:18.403
Yep. that's what pulling
two gs feels like.

709
01:00:18.698 --> 01:00:20.563
It's insane how fast it is.

710
01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:23.067
I'm fighting to keep it
under control the whole time.

711
01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:25.785
Right. number one
reason to lose.

712
01:00:26.081 --> 01:00:27.081
Come on.

713
01:00:30.252 --> 01:00:32.834
Never fight with the bike.

714
01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:35.708
You have to control it
with grace and precision.

715
01:00:36.341 --> 01:00:38.297
Doesn't take much to
get it going.

716
01:00:38.718 --> 01:00:41.710
but the more you fight it.
the more the bike will win.

717
01:00:41.721 --> 01:00:45.885
You have to be zen. okay?

718
01:00:46.143 --> 01:00:48.259
Unlike your character.

719
01:00:48.854 --> 01:00:49.718
Here.

720
01:00:49.729 --> 01:00:51.310
Zen. okay.

721
01:00:51.857 --> 01:00:52.857
Zen.

722
01:00:53.567 --> 01:00:56.400
- Zen. okay.
- Zen. zen.

723
01:00:57.988 --> 01:00:59.228
God. give it to me.

724
01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:03.406
- There you go.
- Okay. just relax.

725
01:01:03.577 --> 01:01:05.192
- don't fight the bike.
- Yep.

726
01:01:05.912 --> 01:01:08.244
And one more thing.
you gotta lock

727
01:01:08.456 --> 01:01:09.946
this thing up real good.

728
01:01:10.792 --> 01:01:11.792
Hmm.

729
01:01:13.003 --> 01:01:14.618
That's the thing.

730
01:01:15.922 --> 01:01:17.128
I don't have a garage.

731
01:01:18.925 --> 01:01:20.711
Well. you can't
leave it outside.

732
01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:24.128
Someone comes in. touches it.
and it's game over for you.

733
01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:27.927
And don't tell anyone
what this bike really is.

734
01:01:28.476 --> 01:01:30.467
Your competitive advantage
is when your opponent

735
01:01:30.645 --> 01:01:32.636
underestimates you. got it?

736
01:01:35.901 --> 01:01:37.266
Can I leave it with you?

737
01:01:38.987 --> 01:01:41.478
Sure. 100 bucks a day.

738
01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:44.856
You don't quit. do you?

739
01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:50.286
How long you been doing this?

740
01:01:51.833 --> 01:01:52.948
Since I was 15.

741
01:01:55.337 --> 01:01:56.372
Impressive.

742
01:01:58.215 --> 01:02:00.251
Hey. you got a handle?

743
01:02:03.428 --> 01:02:05.214
All drag racers have a handle.

744
01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:07.258
You can't be using
your real name.

745
01:02:07.265 --> 01:02:09.176
It's a highly secretive club.

746
01:02:11.937 --> 01:02:13.143
I noticed.

747
01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:16.183
You were ousted from it. right?

748
01:02:18.735 --> 01:02:19.735
Yeah.

749
01:02:21.196 --> 01:02:23.938
Well. it's harder for females
to race at the sprints.

750
01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:26.565
especially when I was winning.

751
01:02:28.828 --> 01:02:31.535
When they found out who I
was as a person.

752
01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:36.575
I pretty much became a.

753
01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:40.620
Got arrested real quickly.

754
01:02:45.011 --> 01:02:46.011
Damn.

755
01:02:47.347 --> 01:02:48.837
Well. when money's at stake.

756
01:02:49.015 --> 01:02:50.255
people will resort to all kinds

757
01:02:50.392 --> 01:02:52.633
of dirty means to
get you ousted.

758
01:02:54.062 --> 01:02:55.802
That's why you need a handle.

759
01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:03.605
Yeah.

760
01:03:07.409 --> 01:03:08.740
It's ghost.

761
01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:25.256
Shit.

762
01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:29.377
What happened?

763
01:03:29.556 --> 01:03:31.092
What the hell do you
think happened?

764
01:03:31.266 --> 01:03:33.222
The triad paid me a
little visit.

765
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:36.350
Sorry. pops.

766
01:03:36.521 --> 01:03:37.806
Yeah. you're sorry.

767
01:03:38.023 --> 01:03:40.230
Didn't I tell you to stay
the hell away from them?

768
01:03:41.401 --> 01:03:43.767
They came at me. what
was I supposed to do?

769
01:03:44.112 --> 01:03:46.444
Yeah. yeah. yeah. what
are you supposed to do?

770
01:03:46.906 --> 01:03:48.612
They're involved in
the races. Manny.

771
01:03:48.783 --> 01:03:50.364
No shit they're
involved in the races.

772
01:03:50.368 --> 01:03:52.609
The triad. the mafia.
the yakuza.

773
01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:53.829
Anywhere there's money.

774
01:03:54.539 --> 01:03:55.641
those assholes got
their hands in it...

775
01:03:55.665 --> 01:03:56.279
Yeah. I don't care
about anybody.

776
01:03:56.458 --> 01:03:58.699
I want cobra. that's it.

777
01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:01.830
I told you. kid. keep
your fight in the ring.

778
01:04:02.088 --> 01:04:03.578
You know what my ring is?

779
01:04:03.757 --> 01:04:07.215
Five to 10 seconds of a
quarter mile in a drag race.

780
01:04:07.469 --> 01:04:09.425
That's the only time
cobra's alone.

781
01:04:09.429 --> 01:04:11.044
None of his goons.
just me and him.

782
01:04:11.222 --> 01:04:12.222
That's the ring!

783
01:04:13.141 --> 01:04:14.847
That's where I'll
get my revenge!

784
01:04:16.436 --> 01:04:17.801
That's when I'll kill him.

785
01:04:19.981 --> 01:04:21.061
You'll kill him?

786
01:04:22.942 --> 01:04:24.648
Do you hear yourself?

787
01:04:26.071 --> 01:04:28.528
You're talking about
taking someone's life.

788
01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:35.615
Well. revenge knows no
other solutions. am I right?

789
01:04:36.456 --> 01:04:39.368
Yeah. revenge and
retribution is an...

790
01:04:39.376 --> 01:04:41.037
Spare me the cliche.

791
01:04:41.211 --> 01:04:45.921
I already made up my mind.
and you can't stop me.

792
01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:52.339
No. I can't stop you.
but I can tell you this.

793
01:04:52.555 --> 01:04:55.342
You go back to the triad.
don't you ever come back here.

794
01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:59.346
All the work I put
in. Getting you out of

795
01:04:59.521 --> 01:05:02.638
the triad to begin
with. put you in that ring.

796
01:05:04.109 --> 01:05:05.440
You became something.

797
01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:08.310
Got rid of all that anger.

798
01:05:09.989 --> 01:05:12.401
You go back to the triad
now. I'm sorry. kid.

799
01:05:12.409 --> 01:05:13.740
don't ever come back here.

800
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:15.650
I'm not gonna go
through this again.

801
01:05:21.126 --> 01:05:25.495
Pops. I'm not asking
for permission.

802
01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:17.132
This garage isn't
open 24 hours. you know?

803
01:06:18.475 --> 01:06:19.760
Got a race.

804
01:06:27.692 --> 01:06:31.435
Still using the same fake
ads as announcements.

805
01:06:31.821 --> 01:06:33.581
I can't believe they
haven't been caught yet.

806
01:06:33.615 --> 01:06:34.730
Idiots.

807
01:06:35.575 --> 01:06:37.236
It's my chance to prove myself.

808
01:06:40.288 --> 01:06:41.403
Don't over-rev.

809
01:06:42.123 --> 01:06:43.533
The bike's powerful.

810
01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:46.206
Keep both wheels on the ground.

811
01:06:47.045 --> 01:06:50.879
And remember. take the
fight out of you.

812
01:06:51.257 --> 01:06:52.463
Don't fight the bike.

813
01:06:54.886 --> 01:06:56.547
Okay. zen.

814
01:06:57.263 --> 01:06:59.629
Yep. zen. =zen.

815
01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:16.108
Little boy comes home
with his new toy.

816
01:07:16.115 --> 01:07:18.106
Who is he racing?

817
01:07:18.284 --> 01:07:20.570
Who is he going to destroy?

818
01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:24.120
Two gs to go.

819
01:07:34.259 --> 01:07:36.875
All right. he has
two thousand. Do it?

820
01:07:37.136 --> 01:07:37.841
And you?

821
01:07:38.096 --> 01:07:39.096
All right.

822
01:07:39.722 --> 01:07:40.302
- Let's do it.
- You're gonna do it?

823
01:07:40.557 --> 01:07:41.672
You good?

824
01:07:46.312 --> 01:07:47.472
It's a race.

825
01:07:51.192 --> 01:07:52.682
You better not spray me.

826
01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:55.146
We ain't using nitrous
for this race.

827
01:07:56.281 --> 01:07:57.566
What are the terms?

828
01:07:57.574 --> 01:07:59.860
Two. and a break for you.

829
01:08:00.535 --> 01:08:02.071
What. what's that?

830
01:08:02.954 --> 01:08:05.286
You're about 40 pounds
lighter than apex.

831
01:08:05.456 --> 01:08:06.616
He gets a break.

832
01:08:06.791 --> 01:08:10.033
You're gonna start two bike
lengths back. all right?

833
01:08:11.713 --> 01:08:13.328
The road is clear.

834
01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:15.126
Let's roll.

835
01:08:15.883 --> 01:08:18.169
Woo!

836
01:08:58.551 --> 01:09:01.588
My sexy beasts. are you ready?

837
01:09:02.055 --> 01:09:04.387
We might never see each
other on this side.

838
01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:09.677
Let's have some wild fun
on a wild fight!

839
01:09:09.687 --> 01:09:15.432
Show me your hands! Go!

840
01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:48.931
Not bad for your first time.

841
01:09:49.102 --> 01:09:50.217
Here's your cut.

842
01:09:52.397 --> 01:09:53.933
You think cobra saw that?

843
01:09:58.277 --> 01:10:00.484
Shit. it's viper.

844
01:10:05.284 --> 01:10:07.195
Viper. viper!

845
01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:11.162
Who's going to pee
in the diaper.

846
01:10:17.004 --> 01:10:18.289
Not bad. kid.

847
01:10:19.006 --> 01:10:20.871
How about taking on
a real rider?

848
01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:22.961
30 gs.

849
01:10:23.136 --> 01:10:25.252
Nice. nice. nice. nice.

850
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:28.297
Second ride. you already
with the midnight squad?

851
01:10:28.307 --> 01:10:30.298
30 gs. can you cough it up?

852
01:10:32.311 --> 01:10:35.599
80 gs. and I want cobra.

853
01:10:36.315 --> 01:10:37.680
80 gs?

854
01:10:37.942 --> 01:10:39.182
You want cobra?

855
01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:40.360
Game on!

856
01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:41.609
Let's get ready.

857
01:10:42.321 --> 01:10:44.107
What the hell are you doing?

858
01:10:44.282 --> 01:10:45.818
Giving him easy money.

859
01:10:45.825 --> 01:10:47.736
No. you're gonna fucking lose.

860
01:10:47.744 --> 01:10:49.860
Look. cobra runs a 7.9.

861
01:10:50.037 --> 01:10:51.527
You're half a second behind.

862
01:10:52.874 --> 01:10:53.874
So be it.

863
01:10:58.755 --> 01:11:02.293
The little monkey is
taking on a snake.

864
01:11:03.301 --> 01:11:04.301
Yeah.

865
01:11:05.386 --> 01:11:06.421
I got him now.

866
01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:13.090
He got you. too. baby.

867
01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:14.930
Just be very careful.

868
01:11:15.605 --> 01:11:20.565
That's going to be the easiest
80 grand he's gonna make.

869
01:11:21.486 --> 01:11:22.726
If he finishes.

870
01:11:23.863 --> 01:11:28.072
I like your guts. Luck might
be on your side

871
01:11:28.326 --> 01:11:32.740
if you hold the bike real tight.

872
01:11:34.499 --> 01:11:37.241
My toy's going to
set up the race.

873
01:11:37.418 --> 01:11:40.501
Make sure you show your face.

874
01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:12.867
How'd it go?

875
01:12:17.542 --> 01:12:21.330
Here's one g. your
side of the deal.

876
01:12:23.422 --> 01:12:24.502
How did she do?

877
01:12:25.925 --> 01:12:26.925
Pure power.

878
01:12:30.429 --> 01:12:31.760
All right.

879
01:12:32.348 --> 01:12:34.179
Clutch is a little loose.

880
01:12:34.433 --> 01:12:36.173
I'll get the
compressed air filled up.

881
01:12:37.019 --> 01:12:38.429
Were you double-footing it?

882
01:12:39.397 --> 01:12:40.397
Hmm?

883
01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:43.022
I hit the shifters at
every 47 hundred.

884
01:12:43.484 --> 01:12:45.520
and changing at each red line.

885
01:12:45.862 --> 01:12:47.352
Don't look at the tach.

886
01:12:48.281 --> 01:12:49.942
You should just be
able to hear it.

887
01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:51.814
Use your ears for shift times.

888
01:12:51.993 --> 01:12:53.324
Eyes straight.

889
01:12:59.083 --> 01:13:01.415
The tires still look
pretty good.

890
01:13:01.836 --> 01:13:04.202
Spend a little more time
in the burnout.

891
01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:07.417
I think you can afford
to get more traction.

892
01:13:09.886 --> 01:13:13.424
Listen. I want a new
set of tires.

893
01:13:14.599 --> 01:13:16.464
Ti want the absolute best.

894
01:13:17.268 --> 01:13:19.179
Ti have a race with cobra.

895
01:13:20.313 --> 01:13:21.313
What?

896
01:13:22.899 --> 01:13:25.185
Yep. he agreed to the terms.

897
01:13:26.193 --> 01:13:27.273
80 gs.

898
01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:32.446
Now where'd you get that
kind of money.

899
01:13:33.451 --> 01:13:35.066
Can you believe
that's all I got?

900
01:13:38.539 --> 01:13:40.951
Yeah. and you're gonna lose
it all. and you know it.

901
01:13:41.542 --> 01:13:44.158
Listen to me. cobra"s
souped-up busa

902
01:13:44.337 --> 01:13:46.168
is enough to destroy... =i know!

903
01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:48.708
You don't have to tell me. okay?

904
01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:51.382
I know what I'm doing.

905
01:13:54.513 --> 01:13:55.798
Your funeral.

906
01:13:56.933 --> 01:13:58.218
It'll be his.

907
01:14:04.148 --> 01:14:05.638
Cut the engines. boys.

908
01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:08.482
You don't wanna wake up
the whole neighborhood.

909
01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:11.394
What is this?

910
01:14:12.073 --> 01:14:15.531
Oh. it's you. apex.

911
01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:17.616
See you changed the bike.

912
01:14:17.954 --> 01:14:19.239
Finally.

913
01:14:19.664 --> 01:14:22.246
You. you are the one
modding his bike?

914
01:14:22.541 --> 01:14:23.541
Yeah.

915
01:14:23.584 --> 01:14:24.869
And what's it to you?

916
01:14:25.544 --> 01:14:27.000
I came here for my money.

917
01:14:27.254 --> 01:14:29.711
Your boy cheated and
spit nitro to win!

918
01:14:36.097 --> 01:14:38.463
It's cold. he didn't use it.

919
01:14:38.641 --> 01:14:39.346
That is bullshit!

920
01:14:39.517 --> 01:14:40.552
Ti cannot be beaten!

921
01:14:40.726 --> 01:14:41.726
You lost. buddy!

922
01:14:41.852 --> 01:14:43.092
I won fair and square.

923
01:14:44.689 --> 01:14:46.850
Break it down then. prove it!

924
01:14:47.066 --> 01:14:48.168
I ain't breaking down shit -

925
01:14:48.192 --> 01:14:51.059
I am not dismantling
shit this late at night.

926
01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:52.856
So go home. apex.

927
01:14:53.155 --> 01:14:55.692
Besides. you know
that the cbr mods

928
01:14:55.950 --> 01:14:59.568
won't spit against the zx-10r.

929
01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:42.337
Boring.

930
01:17:08.207 --> 01:17:09.727
Get the fuck in there
you motherfucker.

931
01:17:09.875 --> 01:17:11.795
Kill that son-of-a-bitch.
Kill that motherfucker.

932
01:17:14.255 --> 01:17:18.214
Ouch. for real.

933
01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:51.872
I know where he keeps his bike.

934
01:17:52.126 --> 01:17:54.663
Mechanic's garage
off 2nd street.

935
01:17:55.504 --> 01:17:57.119
We'll come back tomorrow
with the boys.

936
01:18:12.605 --> 01:18:16.848
You better learn to watch
your back. monkey boy.

937
01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:21.773
As soon as I get out of
here. I got my eyes on you.

938
01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:32.325
Hey. shen long. grab your stuff.

939
01:18:33.792 --> 01:18:35.248
Someone posted your bail.

940
01:19:06.033 --> 01:19:07.819
Didn't know you smoked.

941
01:19:08.452 --> 01:19:10.784
You don't know a lot of
things about me.

942
01:19:12.873 --> 01:19:13.953
Thanks for the bail.

943
01:19:15.376 --> 01:19:17.958
It was your money. the
one g you gave me.

944
01:19:18.254 --> 01:19:19.254
I'll get it back to you.

945
01:19:20.547 --> 01:19:23.755
I know. I figured you
were good for your word.

946
01:19:27.054 --> 01:19:29.887
Look. lucid Lucy called.

947
01:19:29.890 --> 01:19:31.846
What. when?

948
01:19:32.434 --> 01:19:34.925
I picked up. figured it
was a phone call

949
01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:36.310
you didn't wanna miss.

950
01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:43.021
Two days from now. in
between the oak street

951
01:19:43.195 --> 01:19:45.231
and Marina Lane at the docks.

952
01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:49.190
The locals call it cobra Lane.

953
01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:51.862
That's where he lives.

954
01:19:55.082 --> 01:19:58.870
That's midnight squad for
you. private property.

955
01:20:00.296 --> 01:20:03.208
racing between two police
jurisdictions.

956
01:20:05.092 --> 01:20:09.051
Yeah. that's how they avoid
being stopped by cops.

957
01:20:13.309 --> 01:20:14.845
You gotta get ready for this.

958
01:20:16.061 --> 01:20:18.894
You have to know everything
about cobra's bike.

959
01:20:22.151 --> 01:20:23.561
I already do.

960
01:20:31.243 --> 01:20:33.029
Damn.

961
01:20:34.538 --> 01:20:36.278
Someone's obsessive.

962
01:20:37.916 --> 01:20:39.656
I gotta know
everything about him.

963
01:20:40.169 --> 01:20:41.375
Yeah.

964
01:20:43.505 --> 01:20:45.211
Hey. you got any beer?

965
01:20:48.135 --> 01:20:49.625
It's 9 am.

966
01:20:51.764 --> 01:20:54.801
Yeah. it's midnight in China.

967
01:20:58.729 --> 01:21:00.685
Oh my god!

968
01:21:02.941 --> 01:21:05.603
I could sleep forever like this.

969
01:21:07.071 --> 01:21:10.029
No. no. you gotta stay with me.
=-mm hm.

970
01:21:10.699 --> 01:21:13.532
Cobra's bike. let me
see if I got this right.

971
01:21:13.952 --> 01:21:16.659
it's a four-stroke
transverse engine.

972
01:21:16.914 --> 01:21:19.621
13 hundred cc with liquid
cooling system.

973
01:21:19.875 --> 01:21:22.161
and mikuni-denso fuel injection.

974
01:21:22.336 --> 01:21:26.079
Eh. that's just the base model.

975
01:21:27.591 --> 01:21:31.175
Midnight squad allow
nitrous in their races.

976
01:21:31.345 --> 01:21:33.961
so add another 100 bhp to it

977
01:21:34.139 --> 01:21:36.425
and in cobra"s turbo charger.

978
01:21:36.433 --> 01:21:37.843
forced induction combustion.

979
01:21:38.018 --> 01:21:40.885
and you can add another
600 bhp to it.

980
01:21:41.146 --> 01:21:42.886
I could've just asked you.

981
01:21:46.026 --> 01:21:47.357
Where's that put him?

982
01:21:48.779 --> 01:21:50.644
Above your class.

983
01:21:52.157 --> 01:21:54.899
Okay. it's fixable.

984
01:21:55.619 --> 01:21:57.780
Any other modifications
you know about?

985
01:21:58.997 --> 01:22:00.533
Only when I was a member.

986
01:22:00.707 --> 01:22:03.699
He could've changed it.
upgraded it.

987
01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:08.962
Please. come on. please.
wake up. wake up.

988
01:22:09.133 --> 01:22:09.963
- What?
- Okay. okay.

989
01:22:10.134 --> 01:22:11.465
What do we know for sure?

990
01:22:13.512 --> 01:22:15.503
What do we know for sure.
please.

991
01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:17.095
Stay with me.

992
01:22:17.349 --> 01:22:20.466
His stock engine's
replaced with bigger blocks

993
01:22:20.727 --> 01:22:22.888
and custom crankshafts.
which makes his stroke

994
01:22:23.063 --> 01:22:24.394
increase horsepower.

995
01:22:25.023 --> 01:22:27.765
Triple trees are
constructed of lead

996
01:22:28.026 --> 01:22:30.017
to hold down the front ends.

997
01:22:30.195 --> 01:22:33.028
His battery's moved to
the front faring.

998
01:22:33.031 --> 01:22:39.402
Swing arms extended way.

999
01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:41.695
Okay.

1000
01:22:43.041 --> 01:22:44.041
I don't know any of that.

1001
01:22:44.168 --> 01:22:45.408
You're the professional.

1002
01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:50.496
Just tell me what I need to do
to get on par with his bike.

1003
01:22:50.507 --> 01:22:52.919
Don't forget about the fuel mix.

1004
01:22:53.093 --> 01:22:57.211
Yep. he mixes his fuel
with the vbc 45 petrol.

1005
01:22:58.015 --> 01:23:00.927
That alone is over 200
bucks a gallon.

1006
01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:05.178
What his actual fuel is.
only he knows.

1007
01:23:05.397 --> 01:23:08.514
And he changes as he
experiments. so.

1008
01:23:09.067 --> 01:23:10.067
Obviously.

1009
01:23:18.285 --> 01:23:19.616
That's a lot of stuff.

1010
01:23:20.287 --> 01:23:21.287
Mhmm.

1011
01:23:23.290 --> 01:23:27.624
Yeah. well. it's gotta be
in your blood.

1012
01:23:39.264 --> 01:23:41.220
Master Chang wanted you
to have this.

1013
01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:44.971
It's the location of
the next race.

1014
01:23:48.524 --> 01:23:50.185
I'm sure you already know shen.

1015
01:23:52.110 --> 01:23:53.670
Included in there is all
the information

1016
01:23:53.737 --> 01:23:56.979
pertaining to evidence
if you want him arrested.

1017
01:23:58.867 --> 01:24:02.405
Tell master Chang I
appreciate his efforts.

1018
01:24:05.123 --> 01:24:09.116
Oh. by the way. your men
might be getting

1019
01:24:09.294 --> 01:24:14.254
a call from Andromeda. tek's
workshop. you know the place.

1020
01:24:15.259 --> 01:24:17.500
You know the place.
What about it?

1021
01:24:18.554 --> 01:24:20.920
Let's just say shen
isn't going to be racing

1022
01:24:21.098 --> 01:24:22.304
if he doesn't have a bike.

1023
01:24:25.686 --> 01:24:27.096
His bike is at tek's garage?

1024
01:24:27.688 --> 01:24:28.688
Not for long.

1025
01:24:29.690 --> 01:24:32.682
I'll handle the bike.
you take the man.

1026
01:24:41.285 --> 01:24:42.365
What the hell?

1027
01:24:42.536 --> 01:24:44.151
I closed it. Wait here.

1028
01:25:58.403 --> 01:25:59.813
Shut up!

1029
01:26:52.541 --> 01:26:54.497
Come on. come over here.

1030
01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:13.763
Go ahead. let's see if
you're faster than a bullet.

1031
01:27:15.772 --> 01:27:16.431
What do the triads want.
huh. you want money?

1032
01:27:16.606 --> 01:27:18.062
We already said!

1033
01:27:18.442 --> 01:27:19.682
Get out of this town!

1034
01:27:20.736 --> 01:27:22.897
I will. tomorrow.

1035
01:27:23.071 --> 01:27:25.027
You're not going to the races.
either!

1036
01:27:29.161 --> 01:27:32.449
No. no. don't do it!

1037
01:27:34.583 --> 01:27:36.039
Don't fucking do it!

1038
01:27:43.842 --> 01:27:46.254
Next time. it's gonna be

1039
01:27:46.428 --> 01:27:47.838
your fingers. too.

1040
01:28:36.102 --> 01:28:37.558
You okay?

1041
01:28:40.816 --> 01:28:42.397
Is it over?

1042
01:28:44.402 --> 01:28:45.402
Can you repair it?

1043
01:28:52.953 --> 01:28:54.489
I'm sorry.

1044
01:29:03.797 --> 01:29:04.912
It can't be over.

1045
01:29:13.139 --> 01:29:15.972
Ghost. ghost. what the hell?

1046
01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:18.015
I just heard the race was off.

1047
01:29:18.353 --> 01:29:19.809
Talk to me. man.

1048
01:29:19.813 --> 01:29:23.180
You cannot do this. especially
with the midnight squad.

1049
01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:26.608
How am I gonna explain
this to lucid Lucy. huh?

1050
01:29:26.862 --> 01:29:29.820
- It's over.
- Ghost. what?

1051
01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:31.321
Yeah. What the fuck?

1052
01:29:31.575 --> 01:29:32.940
What's going on. man?

1053
01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:34.941
Is this some triad shit?

1054
01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:37.236
They came over here and
told me that shit. dog.

1055
01:29:37.414 --> 01:29:39.905
like they was threatening me
in my own home or something.

1056
01:29:40.083 --> 01:29:41.283
I don't fucking play with that

1057
01:29:41.376 --> 01:29:42.603
- kind of shit.
- Sorry. I can't talk right now

1058
01:29:42.627 --> 01:29:45.460
so is it
true. is the race really off?

1059
01:29:45.839 --> 01:29:47.329
What the fuck? =no.

1060
01:29:48.717 --> 01:29:49.717
No. it's not.

1061
01:29:50.510 --> 01:29:53.627
Hold up. who am I talking to?

1062
01:29:54.514 --> 01:29:56.755
It's Andromeda. kannibal.

1063
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:59.425
The race is happening.

1064
01:30:00.979 --> 01:30:01.979
You have my word.

1065
01:30:02.898 --> 01:30:04.854
Hold up. Andromeda Andromeda?

1066
01:30:05.483 --> 01:30:09.442
Look. your word is good. I'm
gonna let lucid Lucy know.

1067
01:30:09.988 --> 01:30:11.694
and whatever the fuck
y'all smoking on.

1068
01:30:11.907 --> 01:30:13.568
bring some of that shit
tomorrow night.

1069
01:30:13.825 --> 01:30:16.487
I will see you there. on time.

1070
01:30:16.494 --> 01:30:17.609
Oh. you will.

1071
01:30:24.210 --> 01:30:26.246
Thought you said it
couldn't be repaired.

1072
01:30:29.507 --> 01:30:30.872
No. it can't.

1073
01:30:40.685 --> 01:30:42.516
Careful. come.

1074
01:30:44.022 --> 01:30:48.265
This is where I keep all
my forgotten memories.

1075
01:31:03.708 --> 01:31:04.708
What's that?

1076
01:31:05.251 --> 01:31:12.293
This is 115 pounds of torque.

1077
01:31:12.884 --> 01:31:15.876
redlines at 12.500 rpms.

1078
01:31:16.930 --> 01:31:19.262
310 horsepower peak.

1079
01:31:20.475 --> 01:31:28.475
This is the exsr-1000.
not street legal.

1080
01:31:30.068 --> 01:31:32.730
I couldn't take it outside
without getting arrested.

1081
01:31:33.822 --> 01:31:35.358
Sounds fast.

1082
01:31:35.615 --> 01:31:37.230
If you don't think
it's fast enough

1083
01:31:37.409 --> 01:31:38.678
then I don't think
you understand

1084
01:31:38.702 --> 01:31:41.364
what an unprovoked 170
miles per hour wheelie

1085
01:31:41.538 --> 01:31:43.494
means in terms of physics.

1086
01:31:45.166 --> 01:31:46.702
Is that the bike you won with?

1087
01:31:48.586 --> 01:31:49.586
Yeah.

1088
01:31:50.630 --> 01:31:52.586
I mean. I preferred the es-14r

1089
01:31:52.757 --> 01:31:54.873
for its longer body. obviously.

1090
01:31:57.804 --> 01:32:00.386
But there's something
about this bike

1091
01:32:03.435 --> 01:32:06.893
that just speaks to me.

1092
01:32:12.235 --> 01:32:14.942
Ti named it havoc.

1093
01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:18.105
Very suiting.

1094
01:32:22.537 --> 01:32:25.620
You can race with her.

1095
01:32:34.382 --> 01:32:35.497
No.

1096
01:32:37.385 --> 01:32:41.424
Well. she hasn't seen any
action for a very long time.

1097
01:32:42.682 --> 01:32:47.642
I think she wouldn't mind to
go for a round one last time.

1098
01:32:49.647 --> 01:32:52.229
No. you don't get it.

1099
01:32:54.652 --> 01:32:57.860
It's the triads. they
will come for you.

1100
01:32:58.031 --> 01:32:59.817
And I'll be gone.

1101
01:33:02.202 --> 01:33:04.363
I hate this town. anyways.

1102
01:33:07.082 --> 01:33:09.573
I'd rather go somewhere
where nobody knows me.

1103
01:33:18.843 --> 01:33:19.843
Go ahead.

1104
01:33:34.109 --> 01:33:36.065
You've come back.

1105
01:33:39.948 --> 01:33:41.654
She's beautiful.

1106
01:33:43.243 --> 01:33:44.574
Yeah.

1107
01:33:46.538 --> 01:33:47.818
You can have my winnings.

1108
01:33:48.123 --> 01:33:49.283
You can have anything.

1109
01:33:53.419 --> 01:33:56.081
Look. even with this super bike.

1110
01:33:56.256 --> 01:33:59.214
and. trust me. I think she's
much better than the busa.

1111
01:34:02.887 --> 01:34:05.469
you're not skilled enough
to beat cobra.

1112
01:34:06.850 --> 01:34:11.219
You never know. there
might not be a winner.

1113
01:34:13.898 --> 01:34:15.013
What are you gonna do?

1114
01:34:16.442 --> 01:34:19.809
A quarter mile. a thousand feet.

1115
01:34:21.865 --> 01:34:24.026
that's when I'll get my revenge.

1116
01:34:25.285 --> 01:34:26.525
when he's all alone.

1117
01:34:29.914 --> 01:34:31.745
What. are you gonna kick
the bike down?

1118
01:34:32.375 --> 01:34:34.866
I'm gonna kill him the
way he killed my brother.

1119
01:34:54.814 --> 01:34:55.814
Tien.

1120
01:34:56.774 --> 01:34:58.139
What are you doing here?

1121
01:35:02.822 --> 01:35:05.689
Well. I can ask you the
same question.

1122
01:35:06.201 --> 01:35:07.782
This is an active crime scene.

1123
01:35:11.831 --> 01:35:13.662
You know about the races.
don't you?

1124
01:35:15.210 --> 01:35:18.077
Is this still about tien. again?

1125
01:35:21.007 --> 01:35:25.341
Look. I'm not saying your
department's incompetent.

1126
01:35:25.845 --> 01:35:27.801
but this revenge.
this is personal -

1127
01:35:28.056 --> 01:35:29.341
stop.

1128
01:35:31.142 --> 01:35:35.511
If we were able to catch
them in our cars.

1129
01:35:36.731 --> 01:35:39.143
even if we were able to
catch them in our cars.

1130
01:35:39.859 --> 01:35:45.525
they'd get what. 90 days.
$1.000 fine.

1131
01:35:45.865 --> 01:35:46.865
But then what?

1132
01:35:47.784 --> 01:35:49.820
We're right back to square one.

1133
01:35:50.995 --> 01:35:53.327
If it's so inconsequential.
let me have my revenge.

1134
01:35:53.331 --> 01:35:55.117
See. what I'm more
concerned about

1135
01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.365
is you breaking the law.

1136
01:36:01.422 --> 01:36:05.131
Captain. I'm just here to
show him he's not the best.

1137
01:36:05.468 --> 01:36:06.833
That's all.

1138
01:36:07.178 --> 01:36:08.839
He can't get away with anything.

1139
01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:12.217
So you mean to tell me
that this punk ass race

1140
01:36:12.767 --> 01:36:14.507
is what got you all excited?

1141
01:36:23.653 --> 01:36:25.314
Why don't you have your revenge.

1142
01:36:26.447 --> 01:36:31.783
But after that. I don't
wanna see you again.

1143
01:36:34.205 --> 01:36:35.411
Thank you. captain.

1144
01:36:36.499 --> 01:36:41.368
So long as no laws are
broken. do what you gotta do.

1145
01:37:04.068 --> 01:37:05.478
Ready for tonight?

1146
01:37:07.655 --> 01:37:10.818
Yeah. I guess so.

1147
01:37:11.659 --> 01:37:13.866
I got havoc tuned up.
ready to go.

1148
01:37:14.537 --> 01:37:18.621
Nitrous filled. all air
compressor levels checked.

1149
01:37:24.922 --> 01:37:25.922
Pretty crazy. huh?

1150
01:37:27.258 --> 01:37:30.671
Just a week ago. this
city was a stranger to me.

1151
01:37:33.556 --> 01:37:35.717
You're still a stranger
to this city.

1152
01:37:40.730 --> 01:37:42.686
Easy there. cowboy!

1153
01:37:43.900 --> 01:37:45.856
You're gonna need all
your reflexes.

1154
01:37:47.111 --> 01:37:48.851
- I'm good.
- Mm hmm.

1155
01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:51.396
I've got six hours to
get it out of my system.

1156
01:38:00.166 --> 01:38:02.248
I was on par with cobra.

1157
01:38:04.962 --> 01:38:06.827
Some say I was even
better than him.

1158
01:38:11.010 --> 01:38:12.045
I didn't think I was.

1159
01:38:17.225 --> 01:38:20.262
I definitely knew my way through
a bike better than he does.

1160
01:38:22.313 --> 01:38:26.773
He had the cash. I
had the hands.

1161
01:38:30.196 --> 01:38:31.936
So nobody's seen cobra?

1162
01:38:32.990 --> 01:38:33.990
No.

1163
01:38:35.410 --> 01:38:37.901
The level of secrecy is
part of our code.

1164
01:38:40.498 --> 01:38:42.284
Nobody knows anybody.

1165
01:38:44.001 --> 01:38:46.287
We arrived to the
sprints in full gear.

1166
01:38:49.799 --> 01:38:51.585
Only go by our handles.

1167
01:38:54.011 --> 01:38:58.971
And rule number one. never
take off your helmet.

1168
01:39:05.356 --> 01:39:07.472
How were you ousted?

1169
01:39:12.155 --> 01:39:13.611
The guy I was dating.

1170
01:39:17.618 --> 01:39:19.233
He knew I was
going to the sprints.

1171
01:39:19.412 --> 01:39:20.993
so he put two and two together.

1172
01:39:24.083 --> 01:39:26.415
I mean. there's not that
many female racers. so.

1173
01:39:27.211 --> 01:39:29.702
and me being a high
profile at the time.

1174
01:39:31.382 --> 01:39:34.545
I guess it was just a matter
of time before he got bitter.

1175
01:39:38.014 --> 01:39:42.553
After the breakup. he ousted me.

1176
01:39:43.186 --> 01:39:45.928
Damn. that is bitter.

1177
01:39:48.232 --> 01:39:49.392
Yeah.

1178
01:39:51.861 --> 01:39:55.353
Eh. it was time to retire.
anyways.

1179
01:40:01.913 --> 01:40:02.913
Retire?

1180
01:40:04.415 --> 01:40:06.155
You don't look a day past 30.

1181
01:40:13.508 --> 01:40:14.543
Thanks.

1182
01:40:16.886 --> 01:40:22.256
Bu you know when your reflexes
are even a millisecond off.

1183
01:40:24.227 --> 01:40:27.014
just all downhill from there.

1184
01:40:31.442 --> 01:40:37.438
Hey. thank you.

1185
01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:41.190
Everything you did.

1186
01:40:44.705 --> 01:40:46.036
Save it. kiddo.

1187
01:40:46.541 --> 01:40:48.406
Just take the compliment.

1188
01:40:51.879 --> 01:40:55.792
You know 60 grand is more
than enough to say thank you.

1189
01:40:57.510 --> 01:40:59.091
Always about money. huh?

1190
01:41:00.555 --> 01:41:02.045
Gotta pay the bills.

1191
01:41:08.145 --> 01:41:12.354
All right. well. I'll
see you around.

1192
01:41:31.377 --> 01:41:33.083
Wow. wow. wow.

1193
01:41:34.964 --> 01:41:38.832
This is anhdromeda's bike.

1194
01:41:40.219 --> 01:41:41.334
Sure is.

1195
01:41:44.056 --> 01:41:50.143
I never thought I'd
see you at the sprints again.

1196
01:41:51.022 --> 01:41:52.478
Here he comes.

1197
01:41:53.608 --> 01:41:56.520
Welcome. my sexy beast.

1198
01:41:57.695 --> 01:42:01.062
to the hottest
goddess Lucy race!

1199
01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:07.660
I'm so excited to watch
you crash and die.

1200
01:42:11.792 --> 01:42:12.998
Same rules.

1201
01:42:13.169 --> 01:42:18.129
Under the midnight squad.
nitrous is allowed.

1202
01:42:18.382 --> 01:42:22.591
Nobody wait handicaps
in the race.

1203
01:42:23.638 --> 01:42:26.721
If you crash. you're
on your own.

1204
01:42:26.891 --> 01:42:32.386
If you both crash. no one comes
to you or to your funeral!

1205
01:42:32.563 --> 01:42:38.103
Everybody splits as if
this race never happened.

1206
01:42:39.737 --> 01:42:43.195
Tell me. if every
rider understands

1207
01:42:43.366 --> 01:42:46.449
the rules of the sprints.

1208
01:42:49.622 --> 01:42:50.907
Terrific!

1209
01:42:51.082 --> 01:42:52.367
Let's lock the money.

1210
01:42:57.588 --> 01:43:00.455
Drivers. are you ready?

1211
01:43:04.637 --> 01:43:08.971
Go!

1212
01:43:38.421 --> 01:43:40.036
What the hell's going on?

1213
01:44:05.114 --> 01:44:06.524
Nol!

1214
01:44:07.533 --> 01:44:09.273
No you don't!

1215
01:44:09.952 --> 01:44:11.817
Wake up so I can kill you!

1216
01:44:13.914 --> 01:44:15.905
Get up. get up!

1217
01:44:23.174 --> 01:44:25.039
What do you mean nobody's there?

1218
01:44:25.509 --> 01:44:26.509
Where are they now?

1219
01:44:47.615 --> 01:44:50.277
Hey. you know the rules.

1220
01:44:51.285 --> 01:44:52.695
No interference.

1221
01:45:43.170 --> 01:45:45.912
Back off Lucy.
We just need to find cobra.

1222
01:45:51.470 --> 01:45:52.926
You know my rules.

1223
01:45:53.097 --> 01:45:54.633
You know my races.

1224
01:45:54.807 --> 01:45:56.138
Back up.

1225
01:46:23.460 --> 01:46:25.200
You sure you want to do this?

1226
01:46:25.504 --> 01:46:29.543
I don't give a damn
who's out there.

1227
01:46:30.426 --> 01:46:32.758
Let's go.
We'll find cobra later.

1228
01:46:39.602 --> 01:46:41.934
You know they're gonna
come back for you. right?

1229
01:46:41.937 --> 01:46:43.768
Shit. not on our watch.

1230
01:46:44.023 --> 01:46:45.854
So what's gonna happen now?

1231
01:46:48.193 --> 01:46:52.937
Either cobra or ghost
is gonna die tonight.

1232
01:46:54.033 --> 01:46:55.364
Or maybe both.

1233
01:46:59.496 --> 01:47:00.952
Let's see who you -

1234
01:47:04.543 --> 01:47:06.204
captain liddle?

1235
01:47:07.546 --> 01:47:10.003
You figured out who I am.

1236
01:47:10.007 --> 01:47:11.292
Why?

1237
01:47:11.675 --> 01:47:12.790
How?

1238
01:47:13.344 --> 01:47:14.584
You killed my brother?

1239
01:47:14.762 --> 01:47:16.252
Why'd you kill my brother?

1240
01:47:18.307 --> 01:47:21.424
All these questions. all
these fucking-

1241
01:47:21.685 --> 01:47:23.016
why'd you kill him?

1242
01:47:23.646 --> 01:47:25.261
Why'd you kill him?

1243
01:47:28.359 --> 01:47:30.896
You want the answer - =tell me!

1244
01:47:31.111 --> 01:47:33.602
- To the riddle.
- Yeah. so I can kill you.

1245
01:47:33.781 --> 01:47:35.317
Tell me so I can kill you!

1246
01:47:38.535 --> 01:47:39.535
Fuck.

1247
01:47:39.662 --> 01:47:40.662
What?

1248
01:47:42.873 --> 01:47:44.738
No. no. no!

1249
01:47:48.295 --> 01:47:53.255
No!

1250
01:47:56.053 --> 01:47:57.418
T win.

1251
01:48:10.067 --> 01:48:11.773
Not coming back. either.

1252
01:48:27.334 --> 01:48:28.744
It's over now.

1253
01:48:34.591 --> 01:48:37.128
No. you didn't.

1254
01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:45.560
Titi.

1255
01:48:47.438 --> 01:48:49.144
Titi. that you?

1256
01:48:51.734 --> 01:48:52.734
Yeah.

1257
01:48:53.777 --> 01:48:54.777
It is you.

1258
01:48:58.032 --> 01:48:59.738
Did you avenge me?

1259
01:49:00.743 --> 01:49:01.743
No.

1260
01:49:05.748 --> 01:49:06.828
That I did not.

1261
01:49:07.041 --> 01:49:09.748
He died. but not by my hands.

1262
01:49:10.002 --> 01:49:13.085
It doesn't really
matter anymore.

1263
01:49:15.257 --> 01:49:16.838
It matters to me.

1264
01:49:19.386 --> 01:49:21.923
It's time to go home. shen.

1265
01:49:25.684 --> 01:49:26.924
You're not real. are you?

1266
01:49:28.604 --> 01:49:29.604
No.

1267
01:49:52.294 --> 01:49:54.876
He's gone. cobra's dead.

1268
01:49:56.381 --> 01:49:57.541
It's done.

1269
01:50:00.636 --> 01:50:04.595
It is not uncommon. once
vengeance is sought.

1270
01:50:04.848 --> 01:50:06.759
there's nothing else
to live for.

1271
01:50:07.810 --> 01:50:09.346
There was nowhere for him to go.

1272
01:50:09.686 --> 01:50:11.017
What about the captain?

1273
01:50:16.652 --> 01:50:18.233
You think he'll come for us?

1274
01:50:18.654 --> 01:50:19.985
Who?

1275
01:52:16.146 --> 01:52:17.352
Asshole.
