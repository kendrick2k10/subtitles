Buongiorno.

-Can I have eight of the--
-Mm.

Little. uh...

12

(laughs) How much do I owe you?

13
00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:43.497
Ah.

14
00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:48.168
Grazie.

Morning. Castor.

19
00:03:31.336 --> 00:03:33.880
Would you like a bombolone?

20
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.257
A bombolone?

21
00:03:35.257 --> 00:03:38.510
Unless you want me
to take the whole box.

22
00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.596
ooh. because I could eat
my weight in bombolone.

23
00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:44.558
Thank you.

to respect the blade.

Perfect.

44
00:05:52.561 --> 00:05:56.815
Mm. Lorenzo makes the best
bombolone in the city.

45
00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:58.650
You can tell who made it
just by looking at it?

46
00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.736
-Mm. mm.
-He signed his boxes.

47
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.616
-Smart.
-Hm.

48
00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:13.874
Who brought someone else's food
into my kitchen?

49
00:06:13.874 --> 00:06:16.543
I did. and I brought one
for you too.

and a cocktail party
for the guests.

54
00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:41.568
Michel will get us a count
of how many guests this morning.

55
00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:44.279
Tommaso. you're in charge
of the charcuterie board.

56
00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:45.614
and it's hard to mess up
a charcuterie board.

57
00:06:45.614 --> 00:06:46.615
but I'm sure you'll find a way.

58
00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:50.619
We'll be serving dinner
immediately afterwards.

59
00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:52.871
so it doesn't have
to be elaborate. okay?

60
00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:54.080
We don't wanna spoil
anyone's appetite.

61
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.498
Yes. chef.

62
00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:58.793
We'll also need
a cold mixed seafood platter

63
00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:00.253
with three sauces.

64
00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:03.715
Along with that
is a chilled sour cherry soup.

65
00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:06.718
We'll be serving those
in the small ramekin. Guillermo.

66
00:07:06.718 --> 00:07:08.762
Let me know how many you need.

67
00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:11.056
Maya.

68
00:07:11.056 --> 00:07:12.849
Yes. Chef?

69
00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:15.226
Onion gallette.
mushroom croquets.
and fricase.

70
00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:16.728
Don't use too much oil.

71
00:07:16.728 --> 00:07:18.730
Your fricase
were dripping with it last time.

72
00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.232
Don't forget. tomorrow night.

73
00:07:21.232 --> 00:07:23.443
midnight supper
for the (indistinct) party.

74
00:07:28.657 --> 00:07:30.283
Is it somewhere more important
that you'd like to be

75
00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:31.785
-tomorrow night?
-No.

76
00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:33.328
No. Chef.

77
00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:35.288
(playful music)

78
00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:37.666
-No. Chef.
-No. didn't think so.

79
00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:39.334
Okay.

80
00:07:39.334 --> 00:07:41.544
On the menu we've got focaccia.

81
00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:43.546
rump butter and grilled prawns.

82
00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:47.175
fettuccine with fennel
and lamb sausage.

83
00:07:47.175 --> 00:07:49.511
and agnolotti with walnut sauce

84
00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:51.096
and the grilled leg of lamb.

85
00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:54.599
For dessert. the vanilla gelato
with olive oil.

86
00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:56.434
honey and fennel pollen.

87
00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:59.479
-Contestant.
-Yes. Chef.

88
00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:02.816
I read your proposed menu
for the light supper.

89
00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:04.859
You may prepare that
for the staff meal today.

90
00:08:06.528 --> 00:08:08.488
Thanks. Chef. (laughs)

91
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.368
-Let's go.
-(Chef claps)

92
00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:18.373
(exciting music)

93
00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:22.377

(pots clattering)

101
00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:07.047
Chef was really
hard on you today.

102
00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:12.218
He's stressed about
that Diamond Fork thing.

103
00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:16.139
-It's a big deal.
-(vegetables crunching)

104
00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:20.477
And he is human.
even if it doesn't seem like it.

105
00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:23.605
-(chuckles)
-(exciting music continues)

106
00:09:28.359 --> 00:09:30.403
Salads. where are the salads?

107
00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:32.363
(pan sizzling)

108
00:09:35.158 --> 00:09:37.118
Come on. it's noon.

109
00:09:43.875 --> 00:09:47.629
Tommaso. wake up.
Faster. quicker. let's go.

110
00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:49.422
-Yes. Chef.
-More speed.

111
00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:52.717
No. no. no. Move. move. move.

112
00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:54.427
You have to take
your time. okay?

113
00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:58.139
It has to be slower and thicker.
like this.

114
00:09:58.139 --> 00:10:02.018
This is what you want. this.
okay? It's a carrot.

115
00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:06.356
Hold on. hold on.

116
00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:10.944
What is that blob?

117
00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:12.487
Sorry. Chef.
I was just going to--

118
00:10:12.487 --> 00:10:14.864
No. it's okay. it's okay.
Would you serve this?

119
00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:17.742
-You were going to serve this?
-Yes.

120
00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:20.245
(dramatic music)

121
00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:23.706
Do it again!

122
00:10:23.706 --> 00:10:26.543
Bloody running this restaurant
on my own sometimes.

123
00:10:30.755 --> 00:10:34.801
(cheerful piano music)

124
00:10:36.261 --> 00:10:39.889

125

(Chef sniffing)

129
00:11:41.826 --> 00:11:43.828
(slow dramatic music)

130
00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:45.705
(bread crunches)

131
00:11:58.384 --> 00:12:01.638
Mm. this is delicious.

132
00:12:03.598 --> 00:12:07.727
(slow dramatic music continues)

133
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.655
There's coriander in this?
Interesting choice.

134
00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:28.081
(slow dramatic music continues)

135
00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:34.796
Take the lemon down a notch.

136
00:12:34.796 --> 00:12:37.006
It's overwhelming
the other flavors.

137
00:12:37.006 --> 00:12:38.091
Yes. Chef.

138
00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:45.431
(slow dramatic music continues)

139
00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:49.894
And a French style
potato salad.

140
00:12:53.356 --> 00:12:56.901
(playful dramatic music)

141
00:13:11.374 --> 00:13:15.586
(playful dramatic
music continues)

142
00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:26.681
Well. the meal was competently
prepared. it's just boring.

143
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.228
Who can tell me
one of the many things
she did wrong?

144
00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:34.105
Your tenderloins
were too plain.

145
00:13:34.105 --> 00:13:35.606
They needed a sauce.

146
00:13:35.606 --> 00:13:37.025
Yes. a sauce.

147
00:13:37.025 --> 00:13:38.359
And you have a sauce
with your name on it.

148
00:13:38.359 --> 00:13:40.820
That sauce
is my father's secret recipe.

149
00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.072
He says he'll give it to me
on his death bed.

150
00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:49.203
If he drops dead suddenly.
does that mean

151
00:13:49.203 --> 00:13:51.789
the secret will be lost forever?

152
00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.294
My nonna.
she died before revealing

153
00:13:56.294 --> 00:13:58.755
her cacio e pepe sauce.

154
00:13:58.755 --> 00:14:01.424
My grandfather
made the best cheese.

155
00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:04.010
Was your grandfather
from Parma?

156
00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.428
So it was probably
very good cheese.

157
00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:08.097
but it wasn't the best cheese.

158
00:14:08.097 --> 00:14:10.975
You served me little slabs
of meat marinating

159
00:14:10.975 --> 00:14:15.021
in their own fat with
a little garlic and rosemary.

160
00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:17.523
Do you think this restaurant
earned its reputation

161
00:14:17.523 --> 00:14:19.650
by serving pork
with garlic and rosemary?

162
00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:22.070
No. Chef. I don't.

163
00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:25.364
Anyone can do that
in their own kitchen.

164
00:14:25.364 --> 00:14:26.949
You have no business
in my kitchen.

165
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:28.576
We train professionals here.

166
00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:32.205
not glorified fry cooks.
not amateurs who win a contest

167
00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:33.581
to play at being a chef.

168
00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:38.336
(dramatic music)

169
00:14:38.336 --> 00:14:41.047
-I am not playing.
-(playful music)

170
00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:42.965
Well. I thought
the flavors were very fresh

171
00:14:42.965 --> 00:14:44.634
in your potato salad. right?

172
00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:47.178
It was a good balance
between crunch and creamy.

173
00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:50.056
Thank you.

174
00:14:52.266 --> 00:14:55.394
(birds chirping)

175
00:14:58.439 --> 00:15:01.776
(cheerful orchestral music)

176
00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:04.237
What contest
was Chef talking about?

177
00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:07.323
Oh. Cash for Cuisine.

178
00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:10.076
It was a contest put on
by a local TV station

179
00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:11.994
to showcase local cooks.

180
00:15:11.994 --> 00:15:14.872
Yeah. the first prize winner
won $25.000

181
00:15:14.872 --> 00:15:17.792
and a chance to train
under a master chef.

182
00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:20.586
25.000. you won't go
very far these days.

183
00:15:20.586 --> 00:15:22.922
Yeah. well. I have a plan.

184
00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:27.218
So I bought a food truck
at a sheriff's impound sale.

185
00:15:27.218 --> 00:15:29.345
I'm gonna fit it out
and I'm going to use it

186
00:15:29.345 --> 00:15:31.973
to build up clientèle
and get name recognition.

187
00:15:31.973 --> 00:15:37.103
and then transition into
a little sit-down small place.

188
00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:40.314
Serving what?
European fusion food?

189
00:15:40.314 --> 00:15:43.067
No. I'm just here
to learn technique.

190
00:15:43.067 --> 00:15:46.028
But I really wanna cook
the food that I grew up with.

191
00:15:46.028 --> 00:15:48.364
just with a modern twist.

192
00:15:48.364 --> 00:15:52.910
So crab bisque.
shrimp and grits.

193
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:56.330
quartz of gumbo.
low country boil.

194
00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.040
(sighs) So good.

195
00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.918
What are you going to call it?
(speaking foreign language)

196
00:16:00.918 --> 00:16:05.131
(laughs) No. Low Country Love.

197
00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:08.718
But I need backers.

198
00:16:08.718 --> 00:16:12.763
so I need to train
under Chef Penn Childers.

199
00:16:12.763 --> 00:16:15.349
and the way that it's going.

200
00:16:15.349 --> 00:16:18.186
feels like he's gonna fire me
at any moment.

201
00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:22.106
Hmm. he's just stressed
about the Diamond Fork dinner.

202
00:16:22.106 --> 00:16:23.900
Is it really
that big of a deal?

203
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.401
The biggest.

204
00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:28.070
Twenty years ago.
the Florilege has been awarded

205
00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.781
the very first one
that AGG gave out.

206
00:16:30.781 --> 00:16:32.992
AGG?

207
00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:35.203
The Association
of Global Gourmets.

208
00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:38.831
No restaurant has ever won
the Diamond Fork twice.

209
00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:41.375
Chef aims to change that.

210
00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:43.920
Hm.

211
00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.589
(door creaking)

212
00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:48.674
Right. break over. you two.

213
00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:50.218
Kitchen isn't going
to run itself.

214
00:16:50.218 --> 00:16:51.886
(door creaking)

215
00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:53.971
So have you decided
what you're gonna make

216
00:16:53.971 --> 00:16:55.431
for the Diamond Fork?

217
00:16:57.808 --> 00:17:00.102
Perhaps you should concern
yourself with your own cooking.

218
00:17:00.102 --> 00:17:02.271
(phone ringing)

219
00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:03.856
Hello? Yes.

220
00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:08.778
Yes. Ah. for God's sake. please.

221
00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:10.738
No. not this time.

222
00:17:10.738 --> 00:17:13.491
Really? Right. okay.

223
00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:15.534
Please. I...

224
00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:18.079
It just can't happen.

225
00:17:20.456 --> 00:17:21.499
Fine. fine. fine.

226
00:17:21.499 --> 00:17:23.376
Yes. yes. Okay. yep.

227
00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:24.377
Bye.

228
00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:27.922
(playful music)

229
00:17:27.922 --> 00:17:29.257
Is everything okay?

230
00:17:29.257 --> 00:17:33.594
My parents. It's... (sighs)

231
00:17:33.594 --> 00:17:34.804
Are they okay?

232
00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:40.893
They've decided to spend
Christmas at the Florilege.

233
00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:42.436
and they're bringing the Snake.

234
00:17:42.436 --> 00:17:44.188
Your parents have a pet snake?

235
00:17:44.188 --> 00:17:47.567
That's just what I call her.
Ashleigh Symington Price.

236
00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:50.444
Her initial spell ASP.
hence the name.

237
00:17:50.444 --> 00:17:52.071
She's the woman
my parents want me to marry.

238
00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:54.115
They've been talking
about our amazing wedding

239
00:17:54.115 --> 00:17:55.449
since I was six.

240
00:17:55.449 --> 00:17:57.868
I'm doomed.
You're looking at a doomed man.

241
00:17:57.868 --> 00:17:59.620
And you have no say in it?

242
00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.373
Think. Come on. come on. Penn.

243
00:18:02.373 --> 00:18:04.875
What if. what if ASP's too late?

244
00:18:04.875 --> 00:18:07.378
What if. what if I'm already
involved with someone?

245
00:18:09.338 --> 00:18:11.299
-You!
-What?

246
00:18:11.299 --> 00:18:12.800
You're not seeing anyone
right now. are you?

247
00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.552
No. Me?

248
00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:16.762
No. I'm not getting
in the middle of this.

249
00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:18.472
Then you are perfect for it.

250
00:18:18.472 --> 00:18:20.975
You are confident and smart
without making people feel dumb.

251
00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:25.479
You are kind and thoughtful.
You're beautiful.

252
00:18:25.479 --> 00:18:27.523
You're everything
a man could want.

253
00:18:27.523 --> 00:18:31.152
Except for your parents
wants you to marry the Snake.

254
00:18:31.152 --> 00:18:36.949
So no. (scoffs) There is no way.

255
00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:39.160
Your parents
wouldn't even buy it anyway.

256
00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.078
I mean. they don't even know me.

257
00:18:41.078 --> 00:18:42.913
and you just show up engaged?

258
00:18:42.913 --> 00:18:45.166
Well. my parents don't.

259
00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:47.209
they're not really
involved in my life.

260
00:18:47.209 --> 00:18:48.669
They're not involved.

261
00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:50.630
yet they're making
romantic decisions for you?

262
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:52.590
What I mean is. they wouldn't
necessarily expect me

263
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:56.344
to share the news
of my good fortune with them.

264
00:18:56.344 --> 00:18:59.930
Don't you know anyone else?

265
00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:04.268
-What about Edda?
-(playful music continues)

266
00:19:04.268 --> 00:19:06.062
Really?

267
00:19:06.062 --> 00:19:10.024
Listen. if my parents
are skeptical. I'll just say.

268
00:19:10.024 --> 00:19:11.484
you had me at souffle.

269
00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:17.073
-(Maya laughs)
-Maya. wait. wait. listen.

270
00:19:17.073 --> 00:19:20.076
Look. you are gonna
make this really bad

271
00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:22.620
for the both of us.

272
00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.498
You need my endorsement
to get the rest of the money
to open a restaurant.

273
00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:28.376
-What?
-I heard you talking to Edda.
I can make it happen.

274
00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:30.419
-Just do this.
-Wait. so
you're gonna blackmail me?

275
00:19:30.419 --> 00:19:31.671
No. no. no. no.

276
00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:33.881
This is just
business arrangement.

277
00:19:33.881 --> 00:19:36.050
How do you think
this business arrangement's

278
00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:37.677
supposed to work?

279
00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:40.429
I don't know. Jesus Christ.
What's all the questions?

280
00:19:40.429 --> 00:19:42.264
What do you want. a contract?

281
00:19:42.264 --> 00:19:45.226
Okay. and there
wouldn't be any...

282
00:19:45.226 --> 00:19:47.103
Oh. not at all. No. no. no.

283
00:19:47.103 --> 00:19:49.438
Believe me.
I wouldn't even think
about doing that with you.

284
00:19:50.564 --> 00:19:53.150
Because we. uh. work together.

285
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:54.694
That's what I'm trying to say.

286
00:19:57.947 --> 00:20:01.200
(mallet thumping)

287
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.619
(playful music)

288
00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:07.748
I told you there were
something between them.

289
00:20:11.627 --> 00:20:14.255
(glass squeaking)

290
00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:18.300
Ugh. they hate each other.

291
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:21.220
♪ I hurt you
'Cause I love you ♪

292
00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.724
-Shut up.
-(Guillermo laughs)

293
00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:26.767
Shh. they're gonna hear.

294
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.813
(birds chirping)

295
00:20:30.813 --> 00:20:33.816
Listen.
the Florilege is my life.

296
00:20:33.816 --> 00:20:37.069
Everyone needs to understand
what a privilege it is to cook

297
00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:39.280
in a kitchen
with so much history.

298
00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.949
I won't lose this kitchen.
whatever it takes.

299
00:20:46.078 --> 00:20:49.957
Okay. these are the rules.

300
00:20:49.957 --> 00:20:52.960
No touching.
no hugging. no kissing.

301
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.880
and you have
to stop yelling at me.

302
00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.298
Well. I don't yell at you
any more

303
00:20:57.298 --> 00:20:58.424
than I yell at anyone else.

304
00:20:58.424 --> 00:20:59.717
You shouldn't be yelling
at anyone.

305
00:20:59.717 --> 00:21:00.885
Why not?

306
00:21:03.345 --> 00:21:05.347
-She's pregnant.
-Shut up.

307
00:21:05.347 --> 00:21:08.309
-Nah. this is about
the potato salad.
-Hmm.

308
00:21:08.309 --> 00:21:10.603
He finds out
she's a spy undercover.

309
00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:13.564
but a group of terrorists
is keeping her sister hostage.

310
00:21:13.564 --> 00:21:15.524
Now they're coming here
to kill us all.

311
00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.573
And after the engagement.
or after we announced that.

312
00:21:22.573 --> 00:21:25.034
and then... then what?

313
00:21:25.034 --> 00:21:28.370
Just make me the villain.
Tell everyone I dumped you.

314
00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:29.872
Everyone will think I'm a jerk.

315
00:21:29.872 --> 00:21:31.248
I'm used to that.

316
00:21:31.248 --> 00:21:33.375
After I tell everyone
that you dumped me.

317
00:21:33.375 --> 00:21:35.419
my father's gonna wanna have
a conversation with you.

318
00:21:35.419 --> 00:21:37.546
But you'll have
your certificate.

319
00:21:37.546 --> 00:21:39.715
Every restaurant in the world
will welcome you

320
00:21:39.715 --> 00:21:41.133
with a red carpet.

321
00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:43.761
And we won't have to see
each other ever again.

322
00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:50.893
(birds chirping)

323
00:21:50.893 --> 00:21:55.314
No touching.
no hugging. no kissing...

324
00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.566
and no yelling.

325
00:22:02.112 --> 00:22:03.239
Agh.

326
00:22:07.076 --> 00:22:08.160
I look forward to it.

327
00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.455
(gasps)
They will keep the baby.

328
00:22:11.455 --> 00:22:13.707
The potato salad
will be sweeter.

329
00:22:13.707 --> 00:22:16.085
She will pay to keep her cover.

330
00:22:16.085 --> 00:22:18.879
but we saw too much
and we will die anyway.

331
00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.884
(playful music)

332
00:22:23.884 --> 00:22:27.680
I feel like
I'm gonna regret this. (sighs)

333
00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:28.681
She's coming back.

334
00:22:32.142 --> 00:22:36.522
(door creaking)

335
00:22:36.522 --> 00:22:40.401
-(plates clattering)
-(mallet thumping)

336
00:22:40.401 --> 00:22:43.028
(dramatic music)

337
00:22:50.119 --> 00:22:52.037
-Is everything okay?
-Yes.

338
00:22:53.956 --> 00:22:56.375
Is your sister okay?

339
00:22:56.375 --> 00:22:59.086
What? I don't have a sister.

340
00:23:03.424 --> 00:23:06.302
Wait a minute.
What's going on here?

341
00:23:06.302 --> 00:23:08.220
I'll tell you what's happening.

342
00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.389
We're 15 minutes late
for dinner.
so let's just cut the crap.

343
00:23:13.434 --> 00:23:17.438
(inhales sharply) Let's just
get back to work. shall we?

344
00:23:17.438 --> 00:23:18.439
Got a lot to do.

345
00:23:20.107 --> 00:23:23.736
(playful music continues)

346
00:23:33.746 --> 00:23:36.749
(gentle music)

347
00:23:40.085 --> 00:23:43.088
(traffic rumbling)

348
00:24:05.861 --> 00:24:08.489
(phone ringing)

349
00:24:11.283 --> 00:24:14.411
Hey. Maya. they treating you
all right over there?

350
00:24:14.411 --> 00:24:17.373
Hey. Charlene. (laughs)

351
00:24:19.833 --> 00:24:20.960
You look busy.

352
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:21.961
What's that?

353
00:24:26.256 --> 00:24:30.094
Hey. I'll just
call you tomorrow. Love you.

354
00:24:31.345 --> 00:24:32.346
Love you.

355
00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.809
(phone tone plays)

356
00:24:36.809 --> 00:24:40.604
(gentle orchestral music)

357
00:24:46.318 --> 00:24:49.571
(footsteps tapping)

358
00:24:49.571 --> 00:24:50.990
How do you know where I live?

359
00:24:53.117 --> 00:24:54.410
I have something for you.

360
00:24:56.704 --> 00:24:59.665
My parents won't buy the charade
unless I put a ring on it.

361
00:24:59.665 --> 00:25:02.084
Put a ring on it? Seriously?

362
00:25:02.084 --> 00:25:05.129
(scoffs)
I knew this was a bad idea.

363
00:25:05.129 --> 00:25:07.381
I don't really wear
much jewelry.

364
00:25:10.342 --> 00:25:14.179
(gentle orchestral music)

365
00:25:16.181 --> 00:25:19.893
Wow. This is really beautiful.

366
00:25:19.893 --> 00:25:21.770
-Mm-hmm.
-Whose was it?

367
00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:23.313
My grandmother's.

368
00:25:23.313 --> 00:25:25.399
It was in my grandfather's
family for generations.

369
00:25:25.399 --> 00:25:27.151
then he gave it to her.

370
00:25:27.151 --> 00:25:29.737
Won't this make her more crazy?

371
00:25:29.737 --> 00:25:33.699
-Who?
-The Snake. ASP.

372
00:25:33.699 --> 00:25:37.536
Well. it will only
make her go green

373
00:25:37.536 --> 00:25:40.080
and a little smoke and steam

374
00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.041
will come out of her nose
and ears. that's all.

375
00:25:46.587 --> 00:25:47.629
What do you think?

376
00:26:00.392 --> 00:26:02.936
(car starts)

377
00:26:02.936 --> 00:26:06.440
(orchestral music swells)

378
00:26:28.378 --> 00:26:31.965
(gentle orchestral music)

379
00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:41.141
(Penn speaking Italian)

380
00:26:50.734 --> 00:26:53.278
(car revving)

381
00:26:55.155 --> 00:26:56.824
[Maya] You speak Italian well.

382
00:26:56.824 --> 00:27:00.119
[Penn] Well. I'm a chef
in an Italian restaurant.

383
00:27:00.119 --> 00:27:02.162
So you like feeding people?

384
00:27:02.162 --> 00:27:04.164
[Maya] Yeah. it's actually
one of the first things

385
00:27:04.164 --> 00:27:05.958
-my father taught me.
-(birds chirping)

386
00:27:05.958 --> 00:27:09.336
A lot of problems are caused
by people who are hungry.

387
00:27:09.336 --> 00:27:10.462
Feed them.

388
00:27:10.462 --> 00:27:13.340
-He's a wise man.
-Mm.

389
00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:14.758
Or a glorified fry cook?

390
00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:21.473
(gravel crunching)

391
00:27:24.226 --> 00:27:26.186
To be totally honest.

392
00:27:26.186 --> 00:27:29.940
I actually have never eaten
the barbecue before.

393
00:27:31.441 --> 00:27:34.695
Ah. you poor. deprived child.

394
00:27:34.695 --> 00:27:37.406
My father would never
approve me marrying you.

395
00:27:37.406 --> 00:27:41.535
Why not?
I think I'm actually catch.

396
00:27:41.535 --> 00:27:45.122
(laughs) Okay.

397
00:27:45.122 --> 00:27:48.750
Well. my father is actually
the undisputed barbecue king

398
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:50.878
of Charleston. South Carolina.

399
00:27:50.878 --> 00:27:54.798
He has four franchises
in the States and one in Canada.

400
00:27:54.798 --> 00:27:59.011
So me being here is bad enough.
(laughs)

401
00:27:59.011 --> 00:28:00.804
He has a franchise in Canada?

402
00:28:00.804 --> 00:28:05.017
Yeah. people in Canada
go crazy for his cue.

403
00:28:05.017 --> 00:28:06.935
Crazy For his cue?

404
00:28:06.935 --> 00:28:08.604
Oh. yeah. It's a motto.

405
00:28:08.604 --> 00:28:12.691
It's. has it on. like.
t-shirts and jockey shorts.

406
00:28:12.691 --> 00:28:14.651
Now that sounds saucy.

407
00:28:14.651 --> 00:28:16.737
(sighs) Don't even. okay?

408
00:28:16.737 --> 00:28:20.949
I've heard every possible pun
and bad barbecue joke ever.

409
00:28:22.117 --> 00:28:24.244
All right. how's this one?

410
00:28:24.244 --> 00:28:27.080
Why did the skeleton go
to the barbecue?

411
00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.248
To get spare ribs?

412
00:28:28.248 --> 00:28:30.167
-(clicks) Darn it.
-(Maya laughs)

413
00:28:30.167 --> 00:28:32.961
Um. okay.
What do you call a barbecue pun?

414
00:28:34.463 --> 00:28:38.175
A meat-aphor. A meat-aphor.

415
00:28:38.175 --> 00:28:40.719
Okay. stop. okay?

416
00:28:40.719 --> 00:28:42.679
Or I'm gonna have to hurt you.

417
00:28:42.679 --> 00:28:45.265
Really. Yeah.

418
00:28:47.225 --> 00:28:49.561
-Castor.
-Chef.

419
00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:53.148
(cheerful jazz music)

420
00:29:00.739 --> 00:29:02.240
Bonjour. Michel.

421
00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.701
-Bonjour.
-(Maya laughs)

422
00:29:04.701 --> 00:29:06.995
These new decorations
are lovely.

423
00:29:06.995 --> 00:29:08.288
Oh. thank you.

424
00:29:10.624 --> 00:29:13.669
I understand congratulations
are in order.

425
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:17.005
Oh. yes. Thank you.

426
00:29:17.005 --> 00:29:19.424
(laughs) Thank you.

427
00:29:21.343 --> 00:29:25.931
You should know
that the new owners of the hotel

428
00:29:25.931 --> 00:29:30.143
plan to convert
the Florilege on a day spa.

429
00:29:30.143 --> 00:29:31.812
-Oh.
-Mm.

430
00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:43.782
(gentle music)

431
00:29:47.619 --> 00:29:50.622
(bottles clattering)

432
00:29:53.083 --> 00:29:54.876
You're late.

433
00:29:54.876 --> 00:29:57.546
Shouldn't have been wasting time
gossiping with Michel.

434
00:30:06.013 --> 00:30:08.682
(water running)

435
00:30:15.439 --> 00:30:16.565
Perfect.

436
00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:23.989
Perfect. guys. Well done.

437
00:30:23.989 --> 00:30:27.034
(Guillermo shouting)

438
00:30:29.244 --> 00:30:31.913
Hello? Yeah. yeah.

439
00:30:34.166 --> 00:30:35.333
-Okay.
-(phone beeps)

440
00:30:35.333 --> 00:30:36.710
Maya. stop what you're doing.

441
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:38.378
Start a batch
of banana bottom-up ice cream.

442
00:30:38.378 --> 00:30:40.547
-Yes. Chef.
-And you. prep the courgettes.

443
00:30:40.547 --> 00:30:42.966
La Contessa requested moussaka.

444
00:30:42.966 --> 00:30:44.551
La Contessa is here?

445
00:30:44.551 --> 00:30:47.471
She'll be arriving later.
just in time for lunch.

446
00:30:52.768 --> 00:30:55.479
(birds chirping)

447
00:30:59.024 --> 00:31:02.319

448
00:31:02.319 --> 00:31:04.071
(speaking foreign language)

449
00:31:04.071 --> 00:31:06.323
I have something for you to try
when you're on your break.

450
00:31:06.323 --> 00:31:07.407
What is it?

451
00:31:07.407 --> 00:31:09.117
A banana buttermilk croissant

452
00:31:09.117 --> 00:31:11.411
with a ribbon of caramel
woven through it.

453
00:31:11.411 --> 00:31:12.996
Mm. sounds delicious.

454
00:31:12.996 --> 00:31:14.748
(sighs) It is. I invented it.

455
00:31:14.748 --> 00:31:17.542
I'd appreciate your critique.
(laughs)

456
00:31:27.219 --> 00:31:30.764
(gentle playful music)

457
00:31:46.988 --> 00:31:49.658
Oh. Merry Christmas. Castor.

458
00:31:49.658 --> 00:31:51.535
Well. you're looking lovely.

459
00:31:51.535 --> 00:31:54.121
Well. you look
as beautiful as always.

460
00:31:54.121 --> 00:31:56.623
-Oh.
-Welcome back.

461
00:31:56.623 --> 00:32:00.043
Oh. well. thank you.
and it's so good to see you too.

462
00:32:00.043 --> 00:32:01.211
Merry Christmas.

463
00:32:09.344 --> 00:32:11.596
Isn't she gonna check in?

464
00:32:11.596 --> 00:32:14.850
We keep the Golden Suite
reserved for her at all times.

465
00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.145
How long does she usually stay?

466
00:32:19.437 --> 00:32:20.856
Until she's ready to go.

You're on prep tonight.

478
00:33:00.729 --> 00:33:03.398
Get your cousin on the phone
to wash the dishes.

479
00:33:03.398 --> 00:33:04.858
Yes. Chef.

480
00:33:10.447 --> 00:33:13.491
Um. we'll be back

481
00:33:13.491 --> 00:33:15.577
in time to prepare
for the midnight supper.

482
00:33:15.577 --> 00:33:18.788
but I have a meeting
to check if everything's ready

483
00:33:18.788 --> 00:33:19.998
for the Christmas dinner.

484
00:33:21.249 --> 00:33:23.084
Maya. you'll take notes.

485
00:33:25.212 --> 00:33:29.591
Um. Edda.
it's your lucky night tonight.

486
00:33:29.591 --> 00:33:32.594
-You're in charge for dinner.
-Whatever you need. Chef.

487
00:33:32.594 --> 00:33:33.595
Maya.

488
00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:39.059
We are going to die.

489
00:33:43.563 --> 00:33:45.232
Relax.

490
00:33:45.232 --> 00:33:48.026
I think your kitchen will
survive one meal without you.

491
00:33:48.026 --> 00:33:50.028
What if AGG
sends a secret reviewer

492
00:33:50.028 --> 00:33:51.863
a couple of days early. huh?

493
00:33:51.863 --> 00:33:53.406
That would be cheating.
wouldn't it?

494
00:33:53.406 --> 00:33:55.242
Well. the restaurant business
is pretty cutthroat.

495
00:33:55.242 --> 00:33:56.910
and that Chef (indistinct)
is lobbying pretty hard

496
00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:58.245
to win the Diamond Fork. so.

497
00:34:01.164 --> 00:34:02.958
Michel said
something weird today.

498
00:34:04.251 --> 00:34:06.378
Don't listen to a thing
Michel says.

499
00:34:06.378 --> 00:34:07.837
But everyone talks to him.

500
00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:09.923
Come.

501
00:34:09.923 --> 00:34:11.508
No touching. remember?

502
00:34:13.134 --> 00:34:14.135
Drive you home.

503
00:34:15.804 --> 00:34:19.140
(intense orchestral music)

504
00:34:31.361 --> 00:34:33.113
Right. I'll wait here for you.

505
00:34:33.113 --> 00:34:34.572
Okay.

506
00:34:34.572 --> 00:34:36.866
We have to be back
at the Florilege for eight.

507
00:34:36.866 --> 00:34:37.909
Got it.

508
00:34:40.537 --> 00:34:43.123
(gentle music)

509
00:34:47.794 --> 00:34:51.756
Okay. so tell me
what I need to know.

510
00:34:53.341 --> 00:34:57.053
(sighs)
They'll try and twist you.

511
00:34:57.053 --> 00:34:58.972
Reply question
will hide a knife.

512
00:35:00.181 --> 00:35:04.019
My parents. well. they're a lot.

513
00:35:06.271 --> 00:35:08.565
And what about the Snake?
Will she be there?

514
00:35:09.441 --> 00:35:10.567
You bet.

515
00:35:13.028 --> 00:35:16.239
Listen. it's just
a couple of drinks.

516
00:35:16.239 --> 00:35:18.450
Keep smiling
and it'll all be done.

517
00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:19.951
Drunk and dumb woman.

518
00:35:19.951 --> 00:35:21.745
I'm their first target.

519
00:35:21.745 --> 00:35:23.330
They'll try and destroy me
through you.

520
00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:24.789
Don't get caught up in it.

521
00:35:27.751 --> 00:35:28.835
Yay.

522
00:35:31.004 --> 00:35:34.132
(cheerful jazz music)

523
00:35:40.722 --> 00:35:42.349
So I threw him a life ring.

524
00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:44.017
He climbed back on board.

525
00:35:44.017 --> 00:35:47.979
still clutching
the champagne bottle. (laughs)

526
00:35:55.111 --> 00:35:59.866
A very fine vintage though. so.
(laughs)

527
00:36:04.454 --> 00:36:06.164
(Penn knocking)

528
00:36:06.164 --> 00:36:08.041
(door squeaks)

529
00:36:08.041 --> 00:36:12.545
Penn Dragon. I've missed you.
(laughs)

530
00:36:20.136 --> 00:36:22.472
Hi.

531
00:36:22.472 --> 00:36:26.142
Maya. this is my old friend.
Ashleigh.

532
00:36:26.142 --> 00:36:29.854
Ashleigh. this is Maya.
my fiancée.

533
00:36:35.193 --> 00:36:37.779
Well. um. come on in.

534
00:36:37.779 --> 00:36:40.448
Gwendolyn and Jon
are expecting you.

535
00:36:40.448 --> 00:36:42.617
and won't you be
a nice surprise for them?

536
00:36:42.617 --> 00:36:43.702
Hmm.

537
00:36:46.746 --> 00:36:49.916
(cheerful jazz music)

538
00:36:56.881 --> 00:36:59.551
(playful music)

539
00:37:15.525 --> 00:37:18.903
So you met in the kitchen
of the very restaurant

540
00:37:18.903 --> 00:37:21.656
that sent up
incredible food last night.

541
00:37:24.451 --> 00:37:25.910
That's adorable.

542
00:37:28.621 --> 00:37:31.875
Remember that time
you brought me cherries
Jubilee in bed?

543
00:37:31.875 --> 00:37:35.295
-Ashleigh.
-(laughs) Oh. my.
it was just too funny.

544
00:37:35.295 --> 00:37:37.005
He was being so sincere.

545
00:37:37.005 --> 00:37:39.048
and then he set
the sheets on fire

546
00:37:39.048 --> 00:37:42.343
and the smoke alarm went off.
(laughs)

547
00:37:46.598 --> 00:37:49.350
And now he's a world-class chef.

548
00:37:54.147 --> 00:37:56.566
Your little ring is so pretty.

549
00:37:56.566 --> 00:37:59.986
A nice statement
in semi-precious stones

550
00:37:59.986 --> 00:38:02.655
and a wonderful way
to say that engagement rings

551
00:38:02.655 --> 00:38:06.367
don't have to be conflict
diamonds from Africa.

552
00:38:06.367 --> 00:38:08.870
That was my grandmother's ring.

553
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:10.580
It was meant
for someone special.

554
00:38:12.373 --> 00:38:14.751
I always thought
he'd give it to you.

555
00:38:14.751 --> 00:38:18.379
I did give it
to someone special.

556
00:38:18.379 --> 00:38:21.841
(clears throat) Will you be
staying here for the holidays?

557
00:38:23.343 --> 00:38:26.095
Yes. we'll be working.

558
00:38:26.095 --> 00:38:27.555
-Oh.
-Hmm.

559
00:38:27.555 --> 00:38:30.642
That's a shame.
Not even a break to go skiing?

560
00:38:30.642 --> 00:38:33.603
(laughs) Oh. Penn is hopeless
on the slopes.

561
00:38:33.603 --> 00:38:35.647
You should have seen him
the first time Gwendolyn

562
00:38:35.647 --> 00:38:37.982
and Jon took him
skiing in Gstaad.

563
00:38:37.982 --> 00:38:41.486
-Yes. well. in my defense.
I was six.
-He cried.

564
00:38:41.486 --> 00:38:44.072
And I knew I was missing out
on the hot chocolate
back at the lodge.

565
00:38:46.366 --> 00:38:48.243
(door knocking)

566
00:38:48.243 --> 00:38:49.828
Come in.

567
00:38:52.038 --> 00:38:54.916
(cart squeaking)

568
00:39:01.297 --> 00:39:02.924
No. thank you.

569
00:39:02.924 --> 00:39:04.676
[Jon] Me either.

570
00:39:04.676 --> 00:39:06.928
-Anyone?
-Thank you.

571
00:39:08.137 --> 00:39:10.682
(playful music)

572
00:39:16.604 --> 00:39:17.730
Excuse me.

573
00:39:23.486 --> 00:39:25.738
Hello? Yes.

574
00:39:25.738 --> 00:39:29.284
What about your family?
Won't they miss you?

575
00:39:29.284 --> 00:39:31.703
It's just my father and I.

576
00:39:31.703 --> 00:39:33.997
Oh. it's so sad
how many marriages

577
00:39:33.997 --> 00:39:37.834
end up in divorce these days.
especially in America.

578
00:39:37.834 --> 00:39:38.877
One in two. isn't it?

579
00:39:40.503 --> 00:39:42.338
My mother died of breast cancer.

580
00:39:44.716 --> 00:39:45.800
[Penn] Yes. Yes.

581
00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.051
Just start serving.

582
00:39:47.051 --> 00:39:48.261
It's taking longer
than it expected.

583
00:39:48.261 --> 00:39:53.182
Don't screw up. (sighs)

584
00:39:54.183 --> 00:39:55.184
(Penn clears throat)

585
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:06.154
He's not coming.
He's not coming.

586
00:40:06.154 --> 00:40:08.323
He would never leave
the kitchen.

587
00:40:08.323 --> 00:40:12.744
Not to us. Not to you.

588
00:40:12.744 --> 00:40:15.622
What do you mean?
That I'm not good. yeah?

589
00:40:15.622 --> 00:40:18.374
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa. Stop it.

590
00:40:18.374 --> 00:40:20.585
You look like mountain goats.

591
00:40:20.585 --> 00:40:22.045
Let's stop the situation.

592
00:40:25.506 --> 00:40:29.302
I've been working
in this kitchen for seven years.

593
00:40:29.302 --> 00:40:32.096
Chef has never. never left.

594
00:40:32.096 --> 00:40:36.517
(sighs) That must be
a life or death thing.

595
00:40:36.517 --> 00:40:40.021
Seven years
and still dishwasher? Bravo.

596
00:40:40.021 --> 00:40:43.149
And Maya is gone.

597
00:40:43.149 --> 00:40:48.696
like rats running
from a sinking ship.

598
00:40:48.696 --> 00:40:50.615
or a life or death thing.

599
00:40:50.615 --> 00:40:55.620
-But who's dead?
-(doorknob rattling)

600
00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:02.085
[woman] Hey. there's something
blocking the door.

601
00:41:02.085 --> 00:41:03.378
What's going on?

602
00:41:10.051 --> 00:41:12.720
What are you guys doing here?

603
00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:15.974
Chef is gone. Maya disappeared.

604
00:41:15.974 --> 00:41:18.226
She abandoned the ship.

605
00:41:18.226 --> 00:41:21.396
Well actually no.
they're in the Red Suite

606
00:41:21.396 --> 00:41:25.817
having the sort of a meeting
with Penn's parents. I think.

607
00:41:25.817 --> 00:41:29.070
Oh. she's pregnant.

608
00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:30.738
Whatever.

609
00:41:30.738 --> 00:41:33.533
Um. where's the midnight meal?

610
00:41:33.533 --> 00:41:35.743
Let's do it.

611
00:41:35.743 --> 00:41:40.957
For what it counts.
haven't you guys heard?

612
00:41:40.957 --> 00:41:43.167
They're selling the Florilege.

613
00:41:43.167 --> 00:41:49.215
They wanna turn it into a spa.
so bye-bye. fancy kitchen.

614
00:41:49.215 --> 00:41:51.551
-(intense music)
-(knife thunks)

615
00:41:51.551 --> 00:41:54.095
(gentle music)

616
00:42:00.685 --> 00:42:03.354
(door clicking)

617
00:42:04.731 --> 00:42:07.692
(footsteps tapping)

618
00:42:14.365 --> 00:42:16.534
(lighter flicking)

619
00:42:16.534 --> 00:42:19.662
I told you they were terrible.

620
00:42:19.662 --> 00:42:24.625
(sighs) It's okay.
(laughs) I think I'll walk.

621
00:42:24.625 --> 00:42:26.502
Wait. wait. wait. wait. wait.

622
00:42:31.049 --> 00:42:32.341
She's not buying it.

623
00:42:34.886 --> 00:42:36.220
Good night. love birds.

624
00:42:39.724 --> 00:42:42.226
-Please.
-(Maya sighs)

625
00:42:52.445 --> 00:42:55.198
(door slamming)

626
00:43:06.375 --> 00:43:08.044
Did the midnight supper go out?

627
00:43:09.128 --> 00:43:12.215
(gentle music)

628
00:43:13.591 --> 00:43:15.301
Tommaso overcooked the pasta.

629
00:43:16.969 --> 00:43:18.554
He's the pasta master.

630
00:43:18.554 --> 00:43:20.306
I'm sure the guests had seconds.

631
00:43:20.306 --> 00:43:22.266
It's not the point.

632
00:43:22.266 --> 00:43:25.478
Good enough. it's just.
it's not good enough.

633
00:43:27.355 --> 00:43:29.857
People just wanna eat food
that tastes good

634
00:43:29.857 --> 00:43:30.900
and is made with love.

635
00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:33.903
Oh. you're so naive.

636
00:43:33.903 --> 00:43:36.280
Sorry. it's just.
it's dog eat dog out there.

637
00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.908
and every bite counts.

638
00:43:38.908 --> 00:43:40.785
We can't have any mushy pasta
on the night

639
00:43:40.785 --> 00:43:43.037
AGG evaluates us
for the Diamond Fork.

640
00:43:43.037 --> 00:43:45.123
I mean. what if they sent
someone tonight?

641
00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:50.962
So we're done.

642
00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:55.508
Okay. let's go.

643
00:43:56.926 --> 00:43:58.469
And. Maya?

644
00:44:01.305 --> 00:44:02.390
Thank you.

645
00:44:07.728 --> 00:44:10.106
(car starts)

646
00:44:16.487 --> 00:44:19.031
(gentle music)

647
00:44:26.539 --> 00:44:28.040
("Silent Night"
instrumental playing)

648
00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:30.418
(phone ringing)

649
00:44:30.418 --> 00:44:32.837
Hey. Dad.

650
00:44:32.837 --> 00:44:34.380
Hey. baby girl. How you doing?

651
00:44:35.381 --> 00:44:38.801
(sighs) I miss you.

652
00:44:38.801 --> 00:44:42.430
Hey. didn't you go
to high school
with Dwayne Harrison?

653
00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:45.308
Football player
with small hands?

654
00:44:45.308 --> 00:44:47.977
Yeah. I think
he was a year ahead of me.

655
00:44:47.977 --> 00:44:49.478
He became a firefighter. right?

656
00:44:49.478 --> 00:44:50.897
That's right.

657
00:44:50.897 --> 00:44:52.565
I'm catering
his wedding next month.

658
00:44:52.565 --> 00:44:54.734
He's marrying some
emergency room doctor

659
00:44:54.734 --> 00:44:56.444
that he met on the late shift.

660
00:44:57.612 --> 00:44:58.738
You seeing anybody?

661
00:45:00.531 --> 00:45:07.038
Um... (laughs) No.
I'm. I'm too busy.

662
00:45:07.038 --> 00:45:10.917
They're giving you
any time off this Christmas?

663
00:45:10.917 --> 00:45:14.962
No. it's actually one of the
busiest times of year. so.

664
00:45:14.962 --> 00:45:17.298
Well.
that's the restaurant business.

665
00:45:17.298 --> 00:45:21.052
But I think that fancy chef
is working you too hard.

666
00:45:21.052 --> 00:45:24.013
You already a great cook.

667
00:45:24.013 --> 00:45:28.184
You don't need to know how
to make gold plated foie gras.

668
00:45:28.184 --> 00:45:31.395
Besides. I got a franchise
with your name on it.

669
00:45:31.395 --> 00:45:33.898
and you can write
a blog on the side.

670
00:45:33.898 --> 00:45:35.775
There are already
too many food blogs.

671
00:45:35.775 --> 00:45:39.445
But there's only one
Maya Coleman. (laughs)

672
00:45:39.445 --> 00:45:40.863
If you wanna come home
for Christmas.

673
00:45:40.863 --> 00:45:42.240
I'll send you a ticket.

674
00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.533
I'll be home
in a couple of months.

675
00:45:44.533 --> 00:45:45.826
You better be.

676
00:45:47.745 --> 00:45:50.623
You should be out having fun.

677
00:45:50.623 --> 00:45:52.625
But not too much fun.

678
00:45:53.876 --> 00:45:55.378
I miss you. Daddy.

679
00:45:57.421 --> 00:45:59.173
You haven't called me "Daddy"
in a long time.

680
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.429
Okay. well. I gotta go.

681
00:46:05.429 --> 00:46:07.932
All right.
You have a good one.

00:48:11.597 --> 00:48:13.391
Any investor knows that.

711
00:48:13.391 --> 00:48:16.143
One way to lose money
is to turn it
into something else.

712
00:48:20.022 --> 00:48:21.357
If you win the Diamond Fork-

713
00:48:21.357 --> 00:48:23.567
When I win the Diamond Fork.

714
00:48:23.567 --> 00:48:26.320
This place is the only good
thing about my childhood.

715
00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:28.030
My parents used to make a show
of bringing the family

716
00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:29.615
to the Florilege every summer.

717
00:48:29.615 --> 00:48:32.076
but really they just handed me
off to my grandparents

718
00:48:32.076 --> 00:48:34.203
while they were. so they could
be childless and carefree.

719
00:48:34.203 --> 00:48:37.873
It was. it was my grandparents
who taught me how to cook.

720
00:48:40.167 --> 00:48:44.630
How to smell and to taste.

721
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:48.300
They made this place a treasure.
and...

722
00:48:51.929 --> 00:48:56.183
and we need more green lentils.

723
00:48:56.183 --> 00:48:58.769
Carry on.
I'll go and pick up the order.

724
00:48:58.769 --> 00:49:01.272
(gentle music)

725
00:49:16.579 --> 00:49:18.539
(door squeaks)

726
00:49:29.633 --> 00:49:32.761
(cheerful jazz music)

727
00:49:36.056 --> 00:49:39.018
(people chattering)

728
00:49:49.987 --> 00:49:54.366
(cheerful jazz music continues)

729
00:50:12.384 --> 00:50:14.595
Good morning. everyone.

730
00:50:14.595 --> 00:50:17.473
Does everyone in your kitchen
speak English?

731
00:50:17.473 --> 00:50:18.933
-Yes.
-Yes.

732
00:50:18.933 --> 00:50:20.184
Then I won't have to be bothered

733
00:50:20.184 --> 00:50:22.978
to have anyone
translate my message.

734
00:50:22.978 --> 00:50:25.523
I'm here on behalf
of the new owners.

735
00:50:25.523 --> 00:50:27.274
Hawthenthorpe Hospitality Group.

736
00:50:27.274 --> 00:50:29.276
You've no doubt
heard the rumors.

737
00:50:29.276 --> 00:50:31.403
how people do like to gossip.

738
00:50:31.403 --> 00:50:35.491
that we are considering
re-purposing this space
into a spa.

739
00:50:35.491 --> 00:50:39.245
Well. the rumors are true.

740
00:50:39.245 --> 00:50:41.247
Over the next few days.
we'll be evaluating

741
00:50:41.247 --> 00:50:43.582
this restaurant
as a profit center.

742
00:50:43.582 --> 00:50:46.043
Stress testing.
if you might say.

743
00:50:46.043 --> 00:50:48.462
to see
if it might still be viable.

744
00:50:48.462 --> 00:50:52.007
So just go about your business
as I'm not here.

745
00:50:52.007 --> 00:50:53.509
Hm?

746
00:50:53.509 --> 00:50:56.136
(upbeat music)

747
00:51:30.129 --> 00:51:33.632
(upbeat music continues)

748
00:51:50.232 --> 00:51:53.736
(dishes clattering)

749
00:52:00.868 --> 00:52:04.163
(upbeat music continues)

750
00:52:12.338 --> 00:52:13.339
(camera snaps)

751
00:52:21.472 --> 00:52:24.433
(water running)

752
00:52:44.703 --> 00:52:48.540
(upbeat music continues)

753
00:52:52.419 --> 00:52:55.506
(footsteps tapping)

754
00:52:55.506 --> 00:52:57.549
Where's Penn Dragon?

755
00:52:57.549 --> 00:52:59.802
He's at the train station
picking up a delivery.

756
00:52:59.802 --> 00:53:03.180
Oh. that sounds like something
your dishwasher could do.

757
00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:06.517
His name is Guillermo.
and he's busy.

758
00:53:06.517 --> 00:53:08.727
You know. in Japan.

759
00:53:08.727 --> 00:53:11.230
they're already using
robotic dishwashers.

760
00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:14.983
The company's very interested
in how robotics can transform

761
00:53:14.983 --> 00:53:17.027
the hospitality industry.

762
00:53:17.027 --> 00:53:20.239
We've identified several
possible pilot projects

763
00:53:20.239 --> 00:53:21.865
in North America.

764
00:53:21.865 --> 00:53:26.870
The fast food restaurants
are already using robotic cooks.

765
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:31.125
We imagine it can transform
the barbecue sector as well.

766
00:53:32.918 --> 00:53:36.213
(laughs) No one's gonna
buy barbecue from a robot.

767
00:53:36.213 --> 00:53:37.840
Really?

768
00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:39.341
Even if it lowers the prices

769
00:53:39.341 --> 00:53:41.093
and increases the profit margin?

770
00:53:41.093 --> 00:53:42.678
You wouldn't dare.

771
00:53:42.678 --> 00:53:44.930
We're looking closely
to the South Carolina market.

772
00:53:47.307 --> 00:53:48.308
(Ashleigh laughs)

773
00:53:51.979 --> 00:53:55.190
(gentle playful music)

774
00:54:01.488 --> 00:54:04.366
(birds chirping)

775
00:54:04.366 --> 00:54:08.120
Yes. Chef. coming right now.

776
00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:11.957
Guillermo. Chef is at the back
with the supplies.

777
00:54:15.127 --> 00:54:18.130
(playful music)

778
00:54:24.887 --> 00:54:27.723
What happened?
Someone die or something?

779
00:54:27.723 --> 00:54:30.350
A representative from
Hawthenthorpe Hospitality Group

780
00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:31.643
just paid us a visit.

781
00:54:31.643 --> 00:54:32.644
Oh.

782
00:54:34.188 --> 00:54:36.190
Your parents bought the hotel.

783
00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:38.859
My family are negotiating
to acquire the property. yes.

784
00:54:38.859 --> 00:54:42.446
And you didn't think
to tell your fiancée that?

785
00:54:42.446 --> 00:54:44.865
They haven't signed
the paperwork yet.

786
00:54:44.865 --> 00:54:46.408
Well. does Ashleigh know that?

787
00:54:46.408 --> 00:54:48.368
Because she was in here
throwing around her weight

788
00:54:48.368 --> 00:54:51.038
as if it was already
a done deal.
and she threatened to come

789
00:54:51.038 --> 00:54:52.748
after my father's restaurant.
too.

790
00:54:52.748 --> 00:54:54.917
-What? Really?
-Yes.

791
00:54:54.917 --> 00:54:57.836
(sighs) Listen. she's just
giving you a hard time.

792
00:54:57.836 --> 00:54:59.379
Hawthenthorpe Hospitality.

793
00:54:59.379 --> 00:55:00.756
they don't take on
small businesses.

794
00:55:00.756 --> 00:55:03.175
Small? (scoffs)

795
00:55:03.175 --> 00:55:05.969
I just meant purely regional.

796
00:55:05.969 --> 00:55:11.350
Huh. you are such a snob.
(scoffs)

797
00:55:11.350 --> 00:55:12.976
And you knew that
from the beginning.

798
00:55:12.976 --> 00:55:15.187
We had a deal and we are done.

799
00:55:15.187 --> 00:55:17.105
So if you want to leave.
I will sign your certificate.

800
00:55:17.105 --> 00:55:18.899
right here. right now.

801
00:55:18.899 --> 00:55:21.360
I have a restaurant to manage.
and tomorrow.

802
00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:22.778
everyone will know
it's the best in the world.

803
00:55:22.778 --> 00:55:25.572
so if you want to go. go now.

804
00:55:25.572 --> 00:55:28.909
But before you do that. ask
yourself why you are here.

805
00:55:28.909 --> 00:55:30.410
What do you want exactly?

806
00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:32.329
What do you need exactly?

807
00:55:32.329 --> 00:55:34.122
Life is tough.

808
00:55:34.122 --> 00:55:36.291
It can beat you
and take you down.

809
00:55:36.291 --> 00:55:39.086
Take everything you are.
everything you love.

810
00:55:40.754 --> 00:55:42.923
Do you wanna know why I'm here?

811
00:55:42.923 --> 00:55:45.384
Why we are all here?

812
00:55:45.384 --> 00:55:49.346
Because we believe
in this place. your dream.

813
00:55:49.346 --> 00:55:55.102
I left everything for this.
for you.

814
00:55:55.102 --> 00:55:57.729
And you wanna know
why I agreed to our stupid deal

815
00:55:57.729 --> 00:55:59.356
in the first place?

816
00:55:59.356 --> 00:56:01.483
Because I felt sorry for you.

817
00:56:01.483 --> 00:56:03.443
You're a grown man
who can't tell his parents

818
00:56:03.443 --> 00:56:05.529
that you wanna live
your own life.

819
00:56:05.529 --> 00:56:11.451
And this whole masquerade...
is just... (chuckles)

820
00:56:14.496 --> 00:56:16.415
If you don't wanna
marry Ashleigh.

821
00:56:16.415 --> 00:56:18.709
then just tell your parents.

822
00:56:18.709 --> 00:56:20.252
What more can they do to you?

823
00:56:20.252 --> 00:56:22.087
They're already planning
on demolishing

824
00:56:22.087 --> 00:56:23.547
your grandparents' restaurant.

825
00:56:26.466 --> 00:56:27.968
Ugh.

826
00:56:29.886 --> 00:56:34.433
(cheerful music)

827
00:56:37.019 --> 00:56:39.730
(birds chirping)

828
00:56:47.821 --> 00:56:51.575
Right. clean up. go home.
Tomorrow's a big day.

829
00:56:51.575 --> 00:56:53.619
Possibly the biggest.
but you're free.

830
00:56:53.619 --> 00:56:56.913
So. ah. if you still think
it's your chance.

831
00:56:56.913 --> 00:56:58.415
then be here at 7:00 AM.

832
00:56:58.415 --> 00:57:02.127
If not. it's been an honor
to work with you all.

833
00:57:04.212 --> 00:57:05.213
(Maya exhales)

834
00:57:07.841 --> 00:57:11.053
(playful music)

835
00:57:13.221 --> 00:57:16.892
Careful with that ring.
It might get lost.

836
00:57:19.353 --> 00:57:21.730
And what are you getting Penn
for Christmas?

837
00:57:21.730 --> 00:57:22.814
Hmm?

838
00:57:23.774 --> 00:57:24.858
I don't know yet.

839
00:57:26.902 --> 00:57:29.488
Hmm. you know what I bet
he would love?

840
00:57:29.488 --> 00:57:31.448
His grandmother used to make him

841
00:57:31.448 --> 00:57:33.867
this very famous Italian cake.

842
00:57:33.867 --> 00:57:36.203
It's called Dolce di Amalfi.

843
00:57:36.203 --> 00:57:38.664
It's lemons and almonds.

844
00:57:38.664 --> 00:57:41.583
It was his favorite sweet
as a child.

845
00:57:41.583 --> 00:57:45.587
Oh. thank you. (laughs)

846
00:57:45.587 --> 00:57:49.424
Oh. dear. Miss Maya.
you're missing the cocktails.

847
00:57:49.424 --> 00:57:50.509
I told you.

848
00:57:55.222 --> 00:57:57.099
Ah. do you mind?

849
00:57:57.099 --> 00:57:58.725
I would like
to have a little chat

850
00:57:58.725 --> 00:58:00.477
with Penn's fiancée alone.

851
00:58:01.812 --> 00:58:04.356
-Certainly.
-Thank you.

852
00:58:04.356 --> 00:58:06.817
-I'll see you later.
-Oh. boy.

853
00:58:06.817 --> 00:58:09.361
That woman.
she sure makes my skin crawl.

854
00:58:12.781 --> 00:58:16.076
Penn told me
that you've got engaged.

855
00:58:16.076 --> 00:58:20.539
(gasps) Oh. it's so pretty.
Oh. I love it.

856
00:58:20.539 --> 00:58:22.582
I have never been a fan
of those big bubbles

857
00:58:22.582 --> 00:58:24.668
that double as a brass knuckles.
(laughs)

858
00:58:24.668 --> 00:58:27.838
So. I mean. these are just
presents from friends.

859
00:58:27.838 --> 00:58:30.424
So I am so happy for you.

860
00:58:30.424 --> 00:58:33.093
Penn is such.
he is such a sweet boy.

861
00:58:33.093 --> 00:58:34.886
He kind of lost his way
a little bit

862
00:58:34.886 --> 00:58:36.555
when his grandparents
passed away.

863
00:58:36.555 --> 00:58:40.475
but you seem like
you'll be really. really
good for him.

864
00:58:40.475 --> 00:58:44.896
And he is a catch.
He's handsome and kind. rich.

865
00:58:44.896 --> 00:58:46.565
I'm not a gold digger.

866
00:58:46.565 --> 00:58:49.317
Oh. no. I never thought
you were. not at all.

867
00:58:49.317 --> 00:58:53.864
Unlike some of the other people
around here. (laughs)

868
00:58:53.864 --> 00:58:58.577
(sighs) If you'll excuse me.
I have to go.

869
00:58:58.577 --> 00:59:02.873
Tomorrow's a really big day
for a Chef. ah. Penn.

870
00:59:02.873 --> 00:59:04.291
and I don't wanna
disappoint him.

871
00:59:04.291 --> 00:59:05.417
Ah.

872
00:59:11.715 --> 00:59:14.217
(gentle music)

873
00:59:22.517 --> 00:59:25.145
(phone ringing)

874
00:59:33.945 --> 00:59:37.532
(playful orchestral music)

875
00:59:45.957 --> 00:59:51.087
The flowers. one red. one white.

876
00:59:51.087 --> 00:59:55.217
If I see a petal
in the wrong way.
I'm gonna hurt you.

877
00:59:55.217 --> 00:59:58.720
If I see it on the ground.
I'm gonna kill you.

878
01:00:00.222 --> 01:00:03.058
Table toppers need to be ironed.

879
01:00:03.058 --> 01:00:05.060
The guests
will start coming soon.

880
01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:07.187
Get ready. come on!

881
01:00:11.191 --> 01:00:13.485
-Is it true?
-What?

882
01:00:13.485 --> 01:00:15.821
That if we're not getting
the Diamond Fork.

883
01:00:15.821 --> 01:00:18.073
they will turn this place
into a spa?

884
01:00:23.537 --> 01:00:28.708
("God Rest Ye Merry Gentleman"

886
01:01:18.383 --> 01:01:19.801
Thank you.

887
01:01:21.386 --> 01:01:24.097
Today is our last chance
to make history.

888
01:01:26.474 --> 01:01:29.019
We've got work to do. Let's go.

889
01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:34.482
(sighs)

890
01:01:37.402 --> 01:01:41.156

-(cutlery clattering)

894
01:02:36.878 --> 01:02:39.130
I'll be back in a moment.

-(somber music)
-(Penn coughing)

896
01:02:48.306 --> 01:02:49.724
You all right?

897
01:02:49.724 --> 01:02:51.434
Chef? Chef?

898
01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:53.061
Call an ambulance!

899
01:02:53.061 --> 01:02:55.397
Chef? Call an ambulance!

900
01:02:55.397 --> 01:02:56.523
You all right?

901
01:02:57.899 --> 01:02:59.442
(Penn coughing)

902
01:03:03.279 --> 01:03:05.031
Penn just left the hotel
in an ambulance.

903
01:03:05.031 --> 01:03:07.325
-What happened?
-What?

904
01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:11.371
Is that almonds? Who did that?

905
01:03:11.371 --> 01:03:13.623
You told me
that was his favorite cake.

906
01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:18.294
I never would've told you that.
He's allergic to almonds.

907
01:03:18.294 --> 01:03:22.340
I was the one dealing
with his allergy growing up.

908
01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:25.343
Penn knew
this was a hopeless task
from the beginning.

909
01:03:25.343 --> 01:03:27.804
He knew his parents
had no interest in keeping

910
01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:29.806
this restaurant going.

911
01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:32.851
I'm sure the company will
help you find jobs elsewhere.

912

915
01:04:06.926 --> 01:04:08.928
You don't want pastries today?

916
01:04:10.138 --> 01:04:11.598
What's wrong?

917
01:04:11.598 --> 01:04:12.640
Everything.

918
01:04:17.312 --> 01:04:20.356
You came to Italy
to be a cook. yes?

919
01:04:22.025 --> 01:04:23.359
Yes.

920
01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:26.529
And do you believe
that food is everything?

921
01:04:28.448 --> 01:04:30.742
Everything. and more.

922
01:04:30.742 --> 01:04:34.537
Do you know the story
of how the pizza was invented?

923
01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:36.081
No.

924
01:04:36.081 --> 01:04:39.959
It was invented
to please the queen.

925
01:04:39.959 --> 01:04:45.381
The baker took the dough.
covered it
with the tomato sauce.

926
01:04:45.381 --> 01:04:48.218
Mozzarella cheese and basil.

927
01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:51.221

(Lorenzo speaking Italian)

930
01:04:55.183 --> 01:04:59.938
The pizza was called
a Margherita pizza.
like the queen.

931
01:04:59.938 --> 01:05:03.525
No one really remember
that queen.

932
01:05:03.525 --> 01:05:07.904
but the pizza. everybody knows
the Margherita pizza.

933
01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:09.531
even in America.

934
01:05:09.531 --> 01:05:12.742
-So--
-So it's all about the food.

935
01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:15.078
Everything is about food.

936
01:05:16.454 --> 01:05:18.581
Be the pizza. not the queen.

937
01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:22.669
Grazie. Lorenzo.

938
01:05:22.669 --> 01:05:24.754

942
01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:41.104
Maya. I heard Penn
is in the hospital?

943
01:05:41.104 --> 01:05:42.480
Yes.

944
01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:44.399
So you're canceling
tonight's event?

945
01:05:44.399 --> 01:05:47.569
I mean. I've had Mrs. Childers
on the phone all afternoon.

946
01:05:47.569 --> 01:05:48.987
Gwendolyn?

947
01:05:48.987 --> 01:05:51.364
What. she wants to cancel
tonight's dinner?

948
01:05:51.364 --> 01:05:53.241
No. not a chance.

949
01:05:53.241 --> 01:05:55.743
Hey. anyone asks.
the dinner is on tonight.

950
01:05:55.743 --> 01:05:58.663
and we will win
the Diamond Fork.

951
01:05:58.663 --> 01:06:01.291
Now. excuse me.
I have some cooking to do.

952
01:06:02.709 --> 01:06:06.421
(Michel speaking Italian)

953
01:06:09.090 --> 01:06:11.092
Who's got Penn's menu?

954
01:06:11.092 --> 01:06:13.678
I do.
but delivery couldn't get us

955
01:06:13.678 --> 01:06:15.263
all the ingredients we needed.

956
01:06:15.263 --> 01:06:17.849
We don't have much wheat
for all the bread baskets.

957
01:06:17.849 --> 01:06:20.768
That's okay. we'll make
buttermilk cornmeal biscuits.

958
01:06:20.768 --> 01:06:22.187
I've never had those.

959
01:06:22.187 --> 01:06:23.605
They're delicious.

960
01:06:23.605 --> 01:06:26.024
And we don't have
the suckling pigs.

961
01:06:26.024 --> 01:06:27.358
Ah. that's okay.

962
01:06:27.358 --> 01:06:29.319
How many guests
are booked for tonight?

963
01:06:29.319 --> 01:06:30.945
Just the one seating. so 50.

964
01:06:30.945 --> 01:06:33.740
I think I know
where we can find some pork.

965
01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:38.703
Great. If you can give me
30 kilos of pork.
we can do that.

966
01:06:38.703 --> 01:06:40.246
Yes.

967
01:06:40.246 --> 01:06:41.497
We used the last
of the potatoes

968
01:06:41.497 --> 01:06:43.541
on yesterday dishes was.

969
01:06:43.541 --> 01:06:44.667
How are we on rice?

970
01:06:47.795 --> 01:06:51.007
-We are good.
-Damn right. we're good.

971
01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:55.553
Hey. guys. listen.
this might be Penn's dream.

972
01:06:55.553 --> 01:06:57.263
but I think
it might be ours. too.

973
01:06:58.598 --> 01:07:01.226
Be the pizza. not the queen.

974
01:07:05.813 --> 01:07:07.106
-Yes!
-Yes!

975
01:07:07.106 --> 01:07:10.526
Maya. Yes.

976
01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:14.405
A BBQ. what is that?

977
01:07:14.405 --> 01:07:18.868
What? Of course not.

978
01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:20.536
This is the Florilege.

979
01:07:21.496 --> 01:07:24.082
A what? Fire pit?

980
01:07:34.217 --> 01:07:35.260
(door squeaking)

981
01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:36.636
Excuse me.

982
01:07:40.974 --> 01:07:42.725
Hmm.

983
01:07:42.725 --> 01:07:44.644
I'll be glad when she's gone.

984
01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:46.521
Why?

985
01:07:46.521 --> 01:07:48.523
Well. she tips awfully low

986
01:07:48.523 --> 01:07:51.150
for someone
who's getting their room comped.

987
01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:53.736
Well. maybe she's waiting
to leave a big tip

988
01:07:53.736 --> 01:07:54.988
'til the very end.

989
01:07:54.988 --> 01:07:57.407
(scoffs)
Oh. and she's such a pig.

990
01:07:57.407 --> 01:07:59.075
-She is?
-Yeah.

991
01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:02.662
Housekeeper tells me that
the bed sheets are disgusting.

992
01:08:02.662 --> 01:08:04.622
(laughs) Well then.
I imagine she'll be leaving

993
01:08:04.622 --> 01:08:06.040
very soon then.

994
01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:09.877
-Hopefully.
-Hopefully. (laughs)

995
01:08:09.877 --> 01:08:11.671
Is there anything else you need?

996
01:08:11.671 --> 01:08:14.507
No. Thank you so much. Castor.

997
01:08:14.507 --> 01:08:19.637
What? No. it's impossible. no.

998
01:08:20.972 --> 01:08:24.058
I-i-is everything okay?

999
01:08:24.058 --> 01:08:26.269
-Oh. my God.
-What's wrong?

1000
01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:28.271
-Oh. my God.
-What's wrong?

1001
01:08:28.271 --> 01:08:29.897
There's been an accident
in the kitchen.

1002
01:08:29.897 --> 01:08:31.524
Oh.

1003
01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:33.860
Penn is at the hospital now
with an allergic reaction.

1004
01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:35.153
Oh. dear.

1005
01:08:35.153 --> 01:08:37.405
The doctors want
to keep him overnight.

1006
01:08:37.405 --> 01:08:40.241
Oh. wow. Does that mean
you're canceling the dinner?

1007
01:08:40.241 --> 01:08:41.868
That's the point.

1008
01:08:41.868 --> 01:08:44.120
This Maya. the American.

1009
01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.706
she's trying to.
she's asking to...

1010
01:08:48.958 --> 01:08:51.544
[Contessa] Oh. well. oh.
that must be the American.

1011
01:08:53.671 --> 01:08:55.006
Ah. Contessa.

1012
01:08:55.006 --> 01:08:56.674
Oh. Miss Maya.

1013
01:08:56.674 --> 01:08:59.886
Michel just told me
about the accident with Penn.

1014
01:08:59.886 --> 01:09:01.637
I know. I am so sorry.

1015
01:09:01.637 --> 01:09:06.642
But someone tricked me
about Chef. Penn's. allergies.

1016
01:09:06.642 --> 01:09:09.437
I know I should be with him
at the hospital right now.

1017
01:09:09.437 --> 01:09:11.189
'cause I'm his fiancée.
but I just--

1018
01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:12.815
Well. you are doing
the right thing.

1019
01:09:12.815 --> 01:09:14.233
And let me tell you something.

1020
01:09:14.233 --> 01:09:16.778
It has been a long time
since someone

1021
01:09:16.778 --> 01:09:18.571
has done the right thing
for Penn.

1022
01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:23.868
What are you making?

1023
01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:25.828
We're preparing hush puppies.

1024
01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:29.582
Oh. I love hush puppies.
(gasps)

1025
01:09:29.582 --> 01:09:32.877
Oh. the best hush puppies
I ever had
were in South Carolina.

1026
01:09:32.877 --> 01:09:36.756
I stopped at the best
little barbecue joint on my way

1027
01:09:36.756 --> 01:09:38.925
to Florida.
going to a beauty pageant.
of course.

1028
01:09:38.925 --> 01:09:40.843
and I still have the t-shirt
that I bought from there

1029
01:09:40.843 --> 01:09:43.304
that says "Crazy for the Cue."

1030
01:09:43.304 --> 01:09:45.515
Oh. and the best looking man
in Charleston

1031
01:09:45.515 --> 01:09:46.891
was behind the counter.

1032
01:09:46.891 --> 01:09:48.976
I would've of course stayed
for breakfast.

1033
01:09:48.976 --> 01:09:50.561
but he was a single dad.

1034
01:09:50.561 --> 01:09:53.231
and I knew that the only female
that he had time for

1035
01:09:53.231 --> 01:09:57.402
in his life was his
beautiful. beautiful daughter.

1036
01:09:57.402 --> 01:10:00.822
But best hush puppies ever.
(laughs)

1037
01:10:00.822 --> 01:10:04.283
Maya. what'd you wanna do
with all this pork?

1038
01:10:04.283 --> 01:10:08.246
Oh. uh. fire now. Now.

1039
01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:14.752
(machines beeping)

1040
01:10:16.713 --> 01:10:18.214
I know you're awake.

1041
01:10:24.095 --> 01:10:26.556
No. I'm just
having a bad dream.

1042
01:10:26.556 --> 01:10:30.309
(dramatic music)

1043
01:10:30.309 --> 01:10:31.436
What you want. Dad?

1044
01:10:33.146 --> 01:10:35.314
What I've always wanted.

1045
01:10:35.314 --> 01:10:39.193
(scoffs)
What's that? World peace?

1046
01:10:39.193 --> 01:10:41.612
A solution to global warming?

1047
01:10:41.612 --> 01:10:44.157
Grow up.

1048
01:10:44.157 --> 01:10:48.202
You're a Childers.
That name means something.

1049
01:10:48.202 --> 01:10:51.622
My name means something
because I made it
mean something.

1050
01:10:51.622 --> 01:10:56.419
Hmm. working as a chef in that
scruffy little restaurant

1051
01:10:56.419 --> 01:10:58.755
that should have closed
before the century turned?

1052
01:10:58.755 --> 01:11:01.758
That restaurant
was a labor of love.

1053
01:11:01.758 --> 01:11:04.510
And it showed in every plate
of food Nonna ever served.

1054
01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:07.847
That was then. This is now.

1055
01:11:07.847 --> 01:11:09.974
You're going to turn it
into a spa.

1056
01:11:09.974 --> 01:11:11.976
That was as Ashleigh's idea.

1057
01:11:11.976 --> 01:11:15.563
That girl's got a good head
on her shoulders.

1058
01:11:15.563 --> 01:11:17.523
-Why won't you marry her?
-I don't love her.

1059
01:11:17.523 --> 01:11:19.609
What's love got to do with it?

1060
01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:21.444
This is business.

1061
01:11:21.444 --> 01:11:24.614
Are you really going to make
the worst mistake

1062
01:11:24.614 --> 01:11:26.324
of your mistake-ridden life?

1063
01:11:28.326 --> 01:11:30.036
Do you know what?

1064
01:11:30.036 --> 01:11:32.705
The worst mistake I made in life

1065
01:11:32.705 --> 01:11:34.624
was letting you
tell me how to live it.

1066
01:11:36.459 --> 01:11:38.628
You're going to buy
the Florilege

1067
01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:41.255
and destroy it just to punish me

1068
01:11:41.255 --> 01:11:45.551
for not being a good
little corporate drone.

1069
01:11:45.551 --> 01:11:48.262
You are such a disappointment.

1070
01:11:48.262 --> 01:11:51.098
The Florilege
is a national treasure.

1071
01:11:51.098 --> 01:11:53.184
and this restaurant
is the best in the world.

1072
01:11:53.184 --> 01:11:56.354
Hmm. when you're
in the Diamond Fork.

1073
01:11:56.354 --> 01:11:58.022
Hmm.

1074
01:11:58.022 --> 01:12:00.566
Yeah. awards are nice.
but you can't eat them.

1075
01:12:00.566 --> 01:12:05.154
I'm leasing the restaurant.
but I'll buy it one day.

1076
01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:06.197
Not with my money.

1077
01:12:06.197 --> 01:12:08.032
Pff. no.

1078
01:12:08.032 --> 01:12:11.619
No. no. no. no.
Not with your money.

1079
01:12:11.619 --> 01:12:15.498
With what I'm earning from
every plate of food I serve...

1080
01:12:17.041 --> 01:12:20.169
from every single human
that can appreciate

1081
01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:21.546
the labor of love.

1082
01:12:21.546 --> 01:12:24.632
So you think
every problem in the world

1083
01:12:24.632 --> 01:12:27.343
can be solved by feeding people?

1084
01:12:28.386 --> 01:12:30.429
Yeah. it's a start.

1085
01:12:31.597 --> 01:12:32.682
Well played.

1086
01:12:34.016 --> 01:12:35.268
I learned from a master.

1087
01:12:43.776 --> 01:12:48.197
(bright music)

1088
01:12:48.197 --> 01:12:53.077
("Got Rest Ye Merry Gentleman"
instrumental playing)

1089
01:13:06.757 --> 01:13:09.552
(meat sizzling)

1090
01:13:12.305 --> 01:13:17.268
("Got Rest Ye Merry Gentleman"
instrumental continues)

1091
01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.277
(bright music)

1092
01:13:26.277 --> 01:13:28.112
[Maya]
People just want to eat food

1093
01:13:28.112 --> 01:13:29.530
that tastes good
and is made with love.

1094
01:13:29.530 --> 01:13:31.240
[Penn] Oh. you're so naive.

1095
01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:36.954
(footsteps tapping)

1096
01:13:36.954 --> 01:13:40.082
(playful music)

1097
01:13:40.082 --> 01:13:42.043
Sorry I'm late.

1098
01:13:42.043 --> 01:13:44.837
You just missed
a miserable appetizer.

1099
01:13:44.837 --> 01:13:48.174
(Jon murmuring)

1100
01:13:48.174 --> 01:13:52.178
The service here
has really gone downhill.

1101
01:13:52.178 --> 01:13:53.971
[John] Well.
what are you comparing it to?

1102
01:13:53.971 --> 01:13:55.640
[Gwendolyn]
This has really gone downhill.

1103
01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:57.642
-[John] Hmm?
-(Gwendolyn murmuring)

1104
01:13:57.642 --> 01:14:00.436
[Jon]
Wine comes out... (murmuring).

1105
01:14:04.649 --> 01:14:07.944
(bright music)

1106
01:14:07.944 --> 01:14:11.948
(Gwendolyn and Jon murmuring)

1107
01:14:23.209 --> 01:14:25.920
(Ashleigh slurps)

1108
01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:29.423
(bright orchestral music)

1109
01:14:37.348 --> 01:14:39.642
(Ashleigh slurps)

1110
01:14:42.895 --> 01:14:46.440
(dramatic orchestral music)

1111
01:14:54.281 --> 01:14:55.866
Got the sauce?

1112
01:14:55.866 --> 01:14:58.536
For that.
we will need an expert.

1113
01:15:01.414 --> 01:15:05.334
Please. please. please answer.
(sighs)

1114
01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:07.712
(phone ringing)

1115
01:15:11.257 --> 01:15:15.344
Maya. what's going on?

1116
01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:16.721
Is everything okay?

1117
01:15:16.721 --> 01:15:19.473
Dad. I don't have time
to explain. but please.

1118
01:15:19.473 --> 01:15:21.183
I need your help right now.

1119
01:15:22.309 --> 01:15:24.061
What's going on. baby?

1120
01:15:24.061 --> 01:15:26.480
I need the recipe
for the secret sauce.

1121
01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:30.901
Whoa. whoa. baby.
That's our family secret.

1122
01:15:30.901 --> 01:15:34.280
I know.
And I wouldn't be asking
if it wasn't important.

1123
01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:41.120
but this is family business.

1124
01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:44.790
-(gentle music)
-I love you. Dad. please.

1125
01:15:49.170 --> 01:15:51.547
You will keep the secret.

1126
01:15:51.547 --> 01:15:53.424
Promise. (laughs)

1127
01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:03.100
Merry Christmas. baby.

1128
01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:06.896
-(Maya laughs)
-You need pepper and grains.

1129
01:16:09.857 --> 01:16:12.902
(intense music)

1130
01:16:12.902 --> 01:16:14.653
Honey. raw if you have it.

1131
01:16:17.156 --> 01:16:19.200
[Tommaso] Honey.

1132
01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:22.870
Brew coffee.
a cup for every 12 servings.

1133
01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:25.998
Coffee! Brew coffee. STAT!

1134
01:16:25.998 --> 01:16:27.792
-Coffee!
-Coffee!

1135
01:16:29.752 --> 01:16:31.420
[Maya] It's actually one
of the first things

1136
01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:33.214
my father taught me.

1137
01:16:33.214 --> 01:16:36.592
A lot of problems are caused
by people who are hungry.

1138
01:16:36.592 --> 01:16:38.177
Feed them.

1139
01:16:38.177 --> 01:16:41.388
(gentle playful music)

1140
01:16:55.069 --> 01:16:58.280
(bright playful music)

1141
01:17:10.835 --> 01:17:13.796
(music intensifies)

1142
01:17:20.553 --> 01:17:23.639
Now. we need the most
severe judge ever.

1143
01:17:26.767 --> 01:17:30.479
-Edda?
-(dramatic music)

1144
01:17:31.605 --> 01:17:32.606
Please.

1145
01:17:36.777 --> 01:17:39.155
(playful music)

1146
01:17:55.838 --> 01:17:58.007
(music swells)

1147
01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:27.161
(kitchen staff
laughs and cheers)

1148
01:18:27.161 --> 01:18:29.622
Okay. calm down. Calm down.

1149
01:18:29.622 --> 01:18:30.623
All right. It's not over yet.

1150
01:18:30.623 --> 01:18:32.458
Maya. check the quantities.

1151
01:18:32.458 --> 01:18:35.169
Guillermo. Guillermo.
go get the waiters.
We need plates!

1152
01:18:35.169 --> 01:18:36.503
-(Guillermo laughing)
-Woo!

1153
01:18:36.503 --> 01:18:39.506
(bright music)

1154
01:19:05.991 --> 01:19:08.494
(music swells)

1155
01:19:16.418 --> 01:19:19.588
(bright playful music)

1156
01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:22.341
So. what was the reaction?

1157
01:19:22.341 --> 01:19:24.051
Do you think they like it?

1158
01:19:24.051 --> 01:19:27.388
Um. they kept asking for more
and the comments were nice.

1159
01:19:27.388 --> 01:19:29.598
and the tips were astronomical.

1160
01:19:29.598 --> 01:19:30.891
Okay.

1161
01:19:30.891 --> 01:19:32.559
And when the results
will be announced?

1162
01:19:32.559 --> 01:19:34.395
Their table is empty now.

1163
01:19:34.395 --> 01:19:37.690
and they're probably
still discussing.

1164
01:19:37.690 --> 01:19:41.151
but I guess
it's not gonna take long.

1165
01:19:41.151 --> 01:19:42.736
They don't wanna
lose their audience.

1166
01:19:49.410 --> 01:19:51.912
(mysterious music)

1167
01:19:51.912 --> 01:19:55.207
(Ashleigh slurping)

1168
01:20:03.465 --> 01:20:04.717
If you'll excuse me.

1169
01:20:06.093 --> 01:20:07.511
-(playful music)
-There you are.

1170
01:20:07.511 --> 01:20:08.887
Come on.
we don't have much time.

1171
01:20:08.887 --> 01:20:11.223
Ah. I have to go
change my clothes.

1172
01:20:11.223 --> 01:20:13.809
[Contessa]
Exactly. Come with me.

1173
01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:16.770
Oh. Miss Mariana. I can't.

1174
01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:19.231
I really appreciate it. but--

1175
01:20:19.231 --> 01:20:20.566
Oh. no. no. no. no.

1176
01:20:20.566 --> 01:20:22.276
Just think of it
as an engagement gift.

1177
01:20:22.276 --> 01:20:26.447
Ah. I'm not really engaged.

1178
01:20:26.447 --> 01:20:29.408
I know. Penn told me.
But you know what?

1179
01:20:29.408 --> 01:20:32.828
I have known him
for a really long time
and I've never seen

1180
01:20:32.828 --> 01:20:35.039
him look at anyone
the way he looks at you.

1181
01:20:35.039 --> 01:20:38.042
and I think
that you might like him too.

1182
01:20:39.418 --> 01:20:41.128
Sometimes. (laughs)

1183
01:20:41.128 --> 01:20:43.839
Well. good.
Then my job is done here.

1184
01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:45.382
Just a final touch. Come on.

1185
01:20:45.382 --> 01:20:46.925
Let's go win that Diamond Fork.

1186
01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:52.765
(gentle music)

1187
01:20:59.855 --> 01:21:03.567
Oh. that was delicious.
It was so good.

1188
01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:06.862
Oh. here we go.

1189
01:21:06.862 --> 01:21:10.866
Twenty-three years ago.
the AGG awarded

1190
01:21:10.866 --> 01:21:14.453
the first Diamond Fork Award
for Excellence

1191
01:21:14.453 --> 01:21:20.209
to the Florilege and its owner.
Ana and Andrea Childers.

1192
01:21:23.462 --> 01:21:25.672
(Ashleigh groans)

1193
01:21:25.672 --> 01:21:26.965
What's wrong?

1194
01:21:26.965 --> 01:21:29.218
-I...
-(Ashleigh passes gas)

1195
01:21:29.218 --> 01:21:31.011
Um. I'm sorry.

1196
01:21:32.596 --> 01:21:35.307
(playful music)

1197
01:21:43.190 --> 01:21:45.234
What did you do?

1198
01:21:45.234 --> 01:21:47.861
Shh. They're about
to give out the award.

1199
01:21:47.861 --> 01:21:49.196
Let's be quiet.

1200
01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:57.621
(gentle orchestral music)

1201
01:22:17.933 --> 01:22:21.937
(gentle orchestral
music continues)

1202
01:22:39.204 --> 01:22:42.332
Tonight. it's our pleasure
to present

1203
01:22:42.332 --> 01:22:44.543
the Diamond Fork Award.

1204
01:22:54.386 --> 01:22:58.223
(gentle orchestral music)

1205
01:22:59.433 --> 01:23:01.810
It is with an unanimous vote

1206
01:23:01.810 --> 01:23:04.813
that we are presenting the award

1207
01:23:04.813 --> 01:23:07.858
to the Florilege
Hotel and Resort.

1208
01:23:11.695 --> 01:23:14.156
(guests applaud)

1209
01:23:14.156 --> 01:23:16.617
We call the chef and the staff

1210
01:23:16.617 --> 01:23:20.787
from the Florilege kitchen
to receive the award.

1211
01:23:21.872 --> 01:23:23.540
(Maya gasps)

1212
01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:26.001
Chef. go get your award.

1213
01:23:26.001 --> 01:23:27.211
But I don't--

1214
01:23:27.211 --> 01:23:29.087
No. it was. it was you.

1215
01:23:29.087 --> 01:23:31.507
(music swells)

1216
01:23:33.050 --> 01:23:34.510
It was you. Go.

1217
01:23:40.849 --> 01:23:43.101
(guests applauding)

1218
01:23:43.101 --> 01:23:46.063
(joyful orchestral music)

1219
01:24:10.796 --> 01:24:15.551
-(phone buzzing)
-(gentle music)

1220
01:24:16.927 --> 01:24:18.136
We did it!

1221
01:24:19.596 --> 01:24:20.889
Yes!

1222
01:24:20.889 --> 01:24:23.100
Tommaso. I'm so proud of you.

1223
01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:26.144
Chef. no. it wasn't me.
Maya did it.

1224
01:24:26.144 --> 01:24:30.023
Oh. well. can I.
can I talk to her?

1225
01:24:30.023 --> 01:24:31.233
She's gone.

1226
01:24:32.359 --> 01:24:33.694
What?

1227
01:24:33.694 --> 01:24:36.405
Yeah. she said
it was time for her to go.

1228
01:24:36.405 --> 01:24:38.740
[Penn] Well. where did she go?

1229
01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:41.952
I guess she went
to the train station.

1230
01:24:41.952 --> 01:24:43.662
-I'll call you back.
-All right.

1231
01:24:47.082 --> 01:24:48.792
(Maya knocking)

1232
01:24:50.627 --> 01:24:51.920
We are closed.

1233
01:24:56.675 --> 01:24:58.176
(door clicks)

1234
01:24:58.176 --> 01:25:00.053
We have no bombolone now.

1235
01:25:01.847 --> 01:25:04.308
No. I don't want any bombolone.

1236
01:25:04.308 --> 01:25:07.769
I came here to tell you
that we won the Diamond Fork.

1237
01:25:07.769 --> 01:25:08.854
I know.

1238
01:25:10.272 --> 01:25:13.108
Oh. (laughs)

1239
01:25:13.108 --> 01:25:16.820
Well. I'm done here.

1240
01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:22.784
So guess this is goodbye.
(laughs softly)

1241
01:25:33.378 --> 01:25:37.049
(instrumental Christmas music)

1242
01:25:37.049 --> 01:25:38.634
Merry Christmas. Chef.

1243
01:25:38.634 --> 01:25:39.635
(cell phone chimes)

1244
01:25:42.512 --> 01:25:44.848
(nurse speaking in Italian)

1245
01:25:44.848 --> 01:25:46.141
What are you doing?

1246
01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:48.935
(speaking Italian)
What are you doing here?

1247
01:25:48.935 --> 01:25:50.020
(nurse speaking in Italian)

1248
01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:54.608
(bright orchestral music)

1249
01:25:57.027 --> 01:25:59.988
(footsteps tapping)

1250
01:26:20.425 --> 01:26:21.551
Maya!

1251
01:26:23.303 --> 01:26:27.432
Maya. wait! Wait. please.

1252
01:26:27.432 --> 01:26:28.934
Maya. wait. wait.

1253
01:26:30.519 --> 01:26:33.980
(orchestral music swells)

1254
01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:38.735
I'm sorry. (panting)
I was a jerk.

1255
01:26:40.278 --> 01:26:42.572
Yeah.
Well. it's almost midnight.

1256
01:26:42.572 --> 01:26:44.950
and it's time
for Cinderella to go home.

1257
01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:46.702
But that's not
how the story ends.

1258
01:26:51.707 --> 01:26:55.252
Before I met you.
all I had was food.

1259
01:26:55.252 --> 01:26:56.503
I thought that was enough.

1260
01:26:56.503 --> 01:27:00.132
And. and you've taught me
so much.

1261
01:27:00.132 --> 01:27:01.675
and I couldn't have done it
without you.

1262
01:27:04.261 --> 01:27:07.681
I have fallen
completely in love with you.

1263
01:27:09.599 --> 01:27:13.729
I've gone mad.
I can't get you out of my head.

1264
01:27:13.729 --> 01:27:15.313
I can't stop thinking about you.

1265
01:27:19.317 --> 01:27:24.781
I'm not very good at this.
but you have...

1266
01:27:24.781 --> 01:27:28.410
one of the most beautiful smiles
I've ever seen.

1267
01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:31.913
When you walk into a room.
you light the place up.

1268
01:27:33.540 --> 01:27:37.586
And when you look at me.
I go all weak.

1269
01:27:37.586 --> 01:27:39.337
and I feel all gooey inside.

1270
01:27:40.589 --> 01:27:43.800
-(bright music)
-And you have...

1271
01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:49.473
the most purest. kindest souls
I've ever known.

1272
01:27:49.473 --> 01:27:50.932
No matter how much I yelled.

1273
01:27:50.932 --> 01:27:54.895
no matter. I.
I could have shouted at you.

1274
01:27:54.895 --> 01:27:57.939
you stuck around
and you helped me.

1275
01:27:59.858 --> 01:28:02.152
What I'm trying to say is.

1276
01:28:02.152 --> 01:28:04.029
I can't live my life
without you in it.

1277
01:28:07.407 --> 01:28:10.160
I've spent my whole life

1278
01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:11.828
trying to figure out
who I want to be.

1279
01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:15.999
but I won't take as long

1280
01:28:15.999 --> 01:28:17.709
to figure out
who I want to be with.

1281
01:28:24.549 --> 01:28:27.427
(thunder rumbles)

1282
01:28:33.058 --> 01:28:36.728
-No touching. (laughs)
-(Penn laughs)

1283
01:28:36.728 --> 01:28:37.896
No hugging.

1284
01:28:41.191 --> 01:28:43.944
Absolutely no kissing.

1285
01:28:43.944 --> 01:28:47.364
