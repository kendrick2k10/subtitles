3
00:49:43.814 --> 00:49:45.691
You’re holding back. Talk to me.

4
00:49:45.774 --> 00:49:47.193
I want to know what you’re feeling.

5
00:49:52.239 --> 00:49:55.451
I’m just thinking
about this person that’s so broken.

6
00:49:59.038 --> 00:49:59.872
Yourself?

7
00:49:59.955 --> 00:50:00.789
Myself.

8
00:50:00.873 --> 00:50:01.999
So broken?

9
00:50:02.625 --> 00:50:04.251
You feel broken?

10
00:50:06.045 --> 00:50:07.713
How does it feel…

11
00:50:07.796 --> 00:50:10.925
feeling broken sitting right here
in front of me?

12
00:50:11.008 --> 00:50:11.926
I'm looking at you.

13
00:50:12.009 --> 00:50:14.470
How does it feel
to be broken as I look at you?

14
00:50:18.933 --> 00:50:20.100
Hurtful?

15
00:50:21.227 --> 00:50:22.478
Very sad?

16
00:50:22.561 --> 00:50:24.605
Very sad to feel broken…

17
00:50:25.397 --> 00:50:27.274
Very sad to feel broken.

18
00:50:29.068 --> 00:50:32.071
Can you feel
my acceptance of you as broken?

19
00:50:34.156 --> 00:50:35.491
What’s that feel like?

20
00:50:35.866 --> 00:50:36.909
Feels good…

21
00:50:37.618 --> 00:50:38.786
That feels good.

22
00:50:39.537 --> 00:50:42.206
I just wish I wasn’t here at this time…

23
00:50:42.289 --> 00:50:44.416
I mean. I wish I wasn’t here
in my mind right now.

24
00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:45.668
Of course.

25
00:50:49.338 --> 00:50:50.589
I feel like…

26
00:50:50.673 --> 00:50:53.050
I just feel like a bad person.

27
00:50:53.467 --> 00:50:55.678
I feel like…

28
00:50:55.761 --> 00:50:56.804
Mm-hmm.
