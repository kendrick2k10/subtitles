and a duty of care to you.
Ha!

134
00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.160
I am fitter than men half my age.

135

You're a 92-year-old diabetic. Aye.

136
00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:55.160
With erratic blood pressure... Ha.

137
00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.920
...and a weak heart. Well...

138

that students use it for research.

141

Even if you could travel.
I couldn't let you go

142
00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:15.120
without a medical team
and an air ambulance on standby.

143
00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:19.120
Ah. Sounds like
you have me dead and buried already.

144
00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.760
You alright?
Och. kind of.

145
00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.080

Oh.
What're you at?

147
00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.240
Are you planning
a wee excursion or something?

148
00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.760
Aye. I am.
Where to?

149
00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.480
Up your hole. picking daisies.

150
00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:13.600
How in the name of God do you think
you're going to get to Normandy?

151
00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.440
You can't even find the bathroom
on your own.

152
00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.280
Very funny.

153
00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.200
Listen. Artie.

154
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.240
We were all put out about Maggie.

155
00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.040
She was a fine woman. no question.

156
00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.760
But... is this not a bit extreme?

157
00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.040
You survived it once.

158
00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.320
Going back there now
is only asking for trouble.

159
00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.320
Well. I wish you luck.

160
00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.440
You're going to need it.

161
00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:53.920
If you say
"during the war" once more.

162
00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.520

Alright.

198

But you're from the nursing home.

199
00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.840
What's this? Bloody jail break?

200
00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.480
- The station.
- What?
Which way is the station?

201
00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.440
Hurry up. I haven't got all day.

202
00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.760
Right. this isn't gonna...
Hey! Don't you dare.

203
00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.680
I'm not getting the blame for this. OK.

204
00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.760
Here you go.

205
00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.720
20?

206
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.720
Second street on the left. Then
go straight to the top of the road.

207
00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.440
OK.

208
00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.560
Well. I'll drive you there for 30.

209
00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.040
Good morning. sir.
And where are we for today?

210
00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.560
Good morning. Good morning.

211
00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:26.560
Dublin.
Dublin. indeed?

212
00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.320
Day-out in the big smoke?
Aye.

213
00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.600
And no better way
to do it than by train.

214
00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.920
So you get
the 11:30 express to Dublin.

215
00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.400
You got your SmartPass?

216
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.440
What?
If you're over 65.

217
00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.640
you're entitled
to free travel north and south.

218
00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.000
but I need your SmartPass. Ooh.

219
00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.520
Here you are.

220
00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.520
92.

221
00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:53.560
Aye. and three-quarters.
I think that entitles you.

222
00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.000
Argh!

223
00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.400
Ah.

224
00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.600
Blood pressure. Aye.

225
00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.520
I often forget to take them
when I'm travelling.

226
00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:11.840
though I can't imagine missing
the odd one would make a difference.

227
00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.440
But I suppose
you daren't take the risk.

228
00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.560
My daughter's always nagging me
about my tablets.

229
00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.760
Sorry. I'm babbling on.

230
00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:25.480
Again.

231
00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.520
Bad nerves. apparently.

232
00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.640
Do you have children?

233
00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.560
Sorry?

234
00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.320
Ooh. yes. yes.

235
00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.520
We had a daughter after many years.

236
00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:41.400
and a granddaughter
and a great-grandson.

237
00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.760
You're very fortunate.
you know that?

238
00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:47.640
Take my husband -
he was only 48 when he died.

239
00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.760
Never got to see his grandchildren. Oh.

240
00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.240
He always said.
"It doesn't matter what age you are.

241
00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.320
We all have our expiry dates."

242
00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:57.360
Hmm.

243
00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:00.160
I should have died in the war.
but I didn't.

244
00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.920
Oh?

245
00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.280
I'm 92-and-three-quarter years old.

246
00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:07.040
Well past my expiry date.

247
00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.840
'We are now approaching
Dublin Connolly Station.

248
00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.240
This train terminates here.'

249
00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.640
Come in.
Tom's here.

250
00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.880
You wanted to see me?
Yes. Tom.

251
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.920
Take a seat.

252
00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.640
You're pally with Artie Crawford.
aren't you. Tom?

253
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.400
I wouldn't say pally now.

254
00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.480
I see the pair of you
chatting at breakfast.

255
00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.760
I chat. You'd be lucky
to get a grunt out of him.

256
00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.400
Artie appears to be missing.
His suitcase...

257
00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.160
He's escaped?
It's not a prison. Tom.

258
00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:43.200
His toiletries are gone.

259
00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.560
Some of his clothes are missing
and his passport.

260
00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:48.760
Oh. won't get far on that.
It's years out of date.

261
00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.080
How do you know?

262
00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:54.040
Well. at his age it must be.
mustn't it?

263
00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:57.240
Did he say anything to you -
anything at all?

264
00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.800
You know Artie.

265
00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.200
Man of mystery.

266
00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.280
Aye. That's good.
There you go.

267
00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:10.520
Oh. that's lovely.
Thank you so much.

268
00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.760
Good luck.
Thank you. Appreciate it.

269
00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:22.040
Excuse me. excuse me. I'm looking
for the train to Rosslare.

270
00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:25.480
Just missed it. I'm afraid.
Next one's not until 3:45.

271
00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.880
Ah. Does it go to the port?

272
00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.040
I need to catch
the night ferry to France.

273
00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.760
The six o'clock ferry?
Aye.

274
00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.600
You won't make that. not by train.

275
00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.200
The next service doesn't get in
to Rosslare until half past six.

276
00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.920
Ah.

277
00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.080
I shouldn't be saying this.
but if you get the bus...

278
00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.360
There's an express service
goes straight to the port.

279
00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.600
So what you want to do is
you want to go out the main exit.

280
00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.480
down the escalator.
and you'll find a taxi rank there.

281
00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.440
They'll take you to the bus depot.
OK?

282
00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.520
Hey. check this.
Oh!

283
00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.520
Nice one. Trigger. Pure deadly.

284
00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.080
Got him proper good. eh?

285
00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:18.480
That's my bench. mister.
and you're trespassin' on it.

286
00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.400
Yeah. you're trespassin'.

287
00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.000
Go on. Grandad. sling your hook.
Yeah!

288
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.800
And don't forget your kacks.

289
00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.600
What age are you anyway - like. 100?

290
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.480
Probably 200.
Hey! Hey!

291
00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.920
What are you playing at?
I was only joking with him.

292
00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.640
You want to pick on someone?

293
00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.920
I'll give you someone to pick on.
you feckin' toerags.

294
00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:38.360
Go on!

295
00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:42.680
Thank you.
Young ones these days -

296
00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.680
shower of bleedin' wasters.

297
00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.720
Aye.

298
00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.040
Oh.

299
00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.440
Normandy. eh?

300
00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.160
Were you there...

301
00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:03.200
at D-Day?

302
00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:07.040
I was.
Fair play to you.

303
00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.920
Yous had balls. I'll say that.

304
00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.480
You still do.
going back there at your age.

305
00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:16.600
Though to be honest with you.
I never liked the British.

306
00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:20.960
Don't get me wrong now.
a lot of good men died on D-Day.

307
00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:23.240
A lot of good Irishmen too.

308
00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:26.360
But the Brits
have screwed us over for centuries.

309
00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.520
You have to remember that.

310
00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.880
But that's all in the past now. right?

311
00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:34.120
We're all the best of friends
these days.

312
00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.760
But what you fellas done
on them beaches.

313
00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:41.600
Well. I've seen that film
Saving Private Ryan.

314
00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.000
And what you fellas done
was a hell of a thing.

315
00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.480
A hell of a thing.

316
00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:57.000
There go you go. sir.
That's you now.

317
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.160
How much do I owe you?
No. no. put that away.

318
00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:03.840
Never had a D-Day veteran
in my cab before.

319
00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:06.680
It's an honour.
Oh. that's very kind.

320
00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.920
Very kind. Thank you.

321
00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.560
Here. let me help you with that.

322
00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:19.720
Oh.

323
00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.280
That's not fair.

324
00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.320
Not enough space.

325
00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.440
Oh. Ooh!

326
00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.920
Ennio Morricone.

327
00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.960
He's a movie composer.

328
00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.080
I know.

329
00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.120
I met him.

330
00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.720
Ennio Morricone?

331
00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.560
In Verona.

332
00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.320
That's in Italy.

333
00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.360
You went to his concert?

334
00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.480
An anniversary present for my wife.

335
00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.200
No way.

336
00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.640
How did you meet him?
Turned out

337
00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.920
he was staying
at the same hotel as us

338
00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:12.640
and it was his birthday.

339
00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:16.160
- No way?
- Aye. He came down
and introduced himself to us all.

340
00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:18.880
He had a fine handshake -
I remember that.

341
00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:21.040
That's awesome. that. Aye.

342
00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.080
My wife thought so.

343
00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.440
Aye.

344
00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.240
Maestro.

345
00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.960
Huh?

346
00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.120
I remember
everyone called him that -

347
00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.840
maestro.

348
00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:35.400
Well. would it be alright

349
00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:39.120
if I shook the hand of the man
who shook of hand of THE maestro?

350
00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.760
Ah.

351
00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.480
There you go.

352
00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.040
I'm Rory.
Aye. Artie.

353
00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:48.760
♪ ENNIO MORRICONE:

354
00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.160
Thank you.

355
00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.880
Isn't that awesome?

356
00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:28.720
I mean. with the choir
and the orchestra and everything?

357
00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.560
And that oboe.
I mean. who even thought

358
00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.560
that an oboe
could even sound like that?

359
00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:34.600
Didn't that remind you of Verona?

360
00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.120
Aye.

361
00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.320
Thank you.

362
00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:09.120
Right.
seems the fuel pump's banjaxed.

363
00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:11.640
They're sending a replacement coach
down from Dublin.

364
00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.680
So just sit tight and. er.

365
00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:15.960
well. sorry about the inconvenience.

366
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.360
I doubt either of us
will make our sailings at this rate.

367
00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.440
I mean. by the time
they get their act together

368
00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.760
and get another bus
and then bring it down here.

369
00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.480
Aye.

370
00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:30.520
An hour?! Half these passengers
are on the six o'clock ferry.

371
00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:34.120
and I'm not losing my licence again
bombing down that bleedin' road.

372
00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.920
Oh. here. what the...
Here. I'll call you back. Hey!

373
00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.600
What the hell are you playing at?
Stay on the bus. It's not safe.

374
00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.000
It's alright. he's with me.
You what?

375
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.440
He's gonna bleedin' walk
to Rosslare. is he?

376
00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:16.160
It's changed times. Artie. Nobody
stops for hitchhikers nowadays.

377
00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.400
Changed times. indeed.

378
00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:14.160
Tony McCann. Irish Journal.

379
00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:18.720
Uh-huh.

380
00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.760
OK.

381
00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.400
Artie Crawford?

Nothing to write home about. though.

389
00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.360
Nothing's ever happened
in Enniscorthy.

390
00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:48.920
The Battle of Vinegar Hill?

391
00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:52.000
Vinegar what?
1798.

392
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.560
Wolfe Tone. the United Irishmen?

393
00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.440
Did they teach you
nothing at school?

394
00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.680
The Battle of Vinegar Hill was
a turning point in the Rebellion.

395
00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.600
Irishmen
- Catholics and Protestants alike -

396
00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.440
were united in a common cause.

397
00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.320
Independence from the British.

398
00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:07.040
Alright.

399
00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:09.280
So. Artie. what's your story?

400
00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:12.480
I fought with the United Irishmen.

401
00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:14.520
So. I did. Aye.

402
00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.920
But FOR the British.

403
00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:19.000
All for one and one for all. eh?

404
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.040
Aye.

405
00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:25.840
I'm sorry. sir.

406
00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:28.200
I'm afraid we can't disclose
information on residents.

407
00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:29.640
I'm sure you understand.

408
00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:32.160
But by all accounts.
Artie's no longer a resident. is he?

409
00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:33.880
Not if he's done a runner.

410
00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:35.920
So. HAS he done a runner?

411
00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:40.200
Look. Tracy...

412
00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:42.120
That's a beautiful name. by the way.

413
00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:45.320
I respect your professionalism.
but think about it for a minute.

414
00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:48.880
"War veteran escapes old folks' home

416
00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:55.720
Look.
I could get you a special mention.

Big photograph. you and Artie.
front page. full colour.

418
00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:00.000
Boom. what do you say?

419
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
Front page - no way?
I swear to God.

420
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.040
I'd have to get my hair done.

421
00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.720
Of course. Got to look your best.

422
00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:07.880
Buy a new outfit.
Knock yourself out.

423
00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:11.160
Bikini or swimsuit?

424
00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:15.400
You have a lovely day. Tracy.

425
00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.160
You too... sir.

426
00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.720
I need you to book me
onto the next flight to Paris.

427
00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:31.080
I'm gonna need a car
- something decent this time -

428
00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:33.560

what's this mission that you're on?

432
00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.480
Top secret. is it?

433
00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:50.440
Artie. are you OK?

434
00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.480
Artie?

435
00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.560
Artie. can you hear me?

436
00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.840
Oh.
What's wrong with him?

437
00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:58.920
I don't know.
Is he having a stroke or what?

438
00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.120
No. I don't think so.
Well. do something.

439
00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:02.480
I'm thinking.
Jesus Christ!

440
00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.760
All I need is for him to die on me.
No-one's dying.

441
00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:07.000
Here. grab one of those.
What?

442
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.040
I've seen this before.
Artie. are you diabetic?

443
00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:11.760
No. no. no. the other one.
He needs sugar.

444
00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.520
Jesus!
OK. now open it.

445
00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.520
Give him small sips.
You want ME to do it?

446
00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:18.120
Well. I can hardly give it to him.
can I?

447
00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:22.320
Here. Artie. sip this.
It'll make you feel better.

448
00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.040
Good man. Artie.

449
00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:27.360
That's it. Try and swallow now.
Shit. we should call an ambulance!

450
00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:29.280
Calm down.
That's easy for you to say.

451
00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.000
I'm the one
that took him hitchhiking.

452
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.960
What the hell was I thinking?
That's it. Artie.

453
00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:35.480
You'll feel a lot better now
when you get that into you.

454
00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.400
He's coming round.

455
00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:42.720
Thank God for that. Jesus Christ.
I don't know about you. Artie.

456
00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:45.440
but I'm too bloody young
to be having heart attacks.

457
00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.600
Why didn't you say
you hadn't eaten since breakfast?

458
00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:51.120
I took a banana.

459
00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:55.880
Being diabetic is not
something you take lightly. Artie.

460
00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.000
especially at your age. Yeah.

461
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.600
What if you got sick on the ferry?
I mean. no disrespect.

462
00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.320
but. er. you're no spring chicken.

463
00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:08.880
An old army buddy of mine
- Bumper Jones -

464
00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:10.920
he's a Dublin lad.

465
00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:13.240
He said I had nine lives.

466
00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:16.080
He used to call me
the Artful Dodger.

467
00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:21.040
Everyone seemed to get shot
or blown up or something -

468
00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.360
everyone except me.

469
00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:26.480
Even when I did take a shell.
I survived.

470
00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.920
Took half the side off me.

471
00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:32.320
but I survived.

472
00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:35.160
The Artful Dodger.

473
00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:38.080
I'll be fine.

474
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000
I will now.

475
00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:00.960
Careful with it now.

476
00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.720
Look out below.

477
00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:07.680
So. the Cherbourg ferry's
- just through there.
- Right.

478
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.040
I'm headed to Wales.
so I guess this is it.

479
00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.880
Off you go to Wales now. You go
and have a good time and be safe.

480
00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:16.000
Have lots of laughs.
I could help you check in.

481
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.360
No. no. don't worry.
I'll be fine. son. I'll be fine.

482
00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.560
Thank you.

483
00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:24.040
See you. then.
Oh. mind the leg.

484
00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:26.560
Aye. I will.

485
00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:29.720
Make sure you get a solid meal as
soon as you get on board. won't you?

486
00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:31.760
I will. I will. I will.

487
00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:34.800
Alright. thank you. Thank you. both.

488
00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.840
It's been a pleasure. maestro.

489
00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.920
Oh. aye.

490
00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:43.240
It's clearly me. huh?

491
00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.560
You can see from the photograph.
Look. that's me.

492
00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:49.000
Yes.
but's 17 years out of date. sir.

493
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.320
What? Is that so? Are you sure?
It expired in 2002.

494
00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.480
Aye now. but it's me.

495
00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:58.920
Look. there you go now.
Arthur Crawford.

496
00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:02.200
I believe you. sir. But you need a
valid passport to travel to France.

497
00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:04.240
No exceptions.

498
00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:08.640
My wife normally
organised things like this.

499
00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:10.680
But. erm.

500
00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:12.920
she's... she's dead.

501
00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:19.160
I'm sorry. but
it's French Customs and Immigration.

502
00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:20.920
The memorial service is tomorrow.

503
00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.680
The D-Day anniversary.

504
00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:24.480
I need to be in Normandy.

505
00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:27.280
Hold your wish now.
Here you go. Here you go.

506
00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:29.440
I can't let you travel. sir.

507
00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.480
I'd lose my job.

508
00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:33.360
Now. if you don't mind.
we have customers

509
00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:36.120
with valid passports
waiting to check in. Next!

510
00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:39.960
Passports and travel documents. please.

511
00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:43.960
I heard what she said. sir.
She's right.

512
00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.280
They'll just send you straight back.

513
00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:48.480
Sorry.

514
00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:51.480
Is there anything I can do?
Do you need a taxi or a bus?

515
00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:53.200
No. no. no.

516
00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:26.840
Excuse me. excuse me.

517
00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:33.160
I never introduced myself.

518
00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:35.080
My name's Artie Crawford.

519
00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:39.160
Second Battalion
Royal Ulster Rifles. retired.

520
00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:40.920
I have to get to France.

521
00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:43.560
and you might be my only hope.

522
00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:49.120
I'm sorry. sir.

523
00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:51.720
Erm. I'd love to help
- I really would -

524
00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:55.200
but the custom people in Cherbourg
check every passenger in every car.

525
00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.920
Aye.
And that's why you can help me.

526
00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.280
Can I have your tickets?

527
00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:13.360
Thank you.
Thank you.

528
00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:33.600
Ooh.

529
00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.920
Artie.

530
00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:13.080
I got you a cabin.

531
00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:17.480
'Well. it's
one exam down. but many more to go.

532
00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:20.360
For most Leaving Cert students.
their next big challenge

533
00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:23.200
is English Paper II
tomorrow afternoon.

534
00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:25.080
This is Emma O'Kelly. RTE News.

536
00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:31.880
'And still to come on Tonight 61.
we have more from Doonbeg.

537
00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:35.600

12 days after voting.

538
00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:37.960
the final seats
are filled in Ireland South.'

539
00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:45.240
'Hello. RTE news desk.'

540
00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.400
Aye. come in.

541
00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:58.280
Oh. Juliette.

542
00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:01.760
Don't show yourself. Artie.
or we'll all end up behind bars.

543
00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.760
We're in the next cabin
if you need us.

544
00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:08.200
You didn't have to do all of this.
you know.

545
00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:11.680
My grandmother was in the Resistance
during the war.

546
00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:14.200
She helped
British soldiers escape from France.

547
00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.520
So maybe it's in our blood -

548
00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:18.560
smuggling soldiers.

549
00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:20.680
Shh.

550
00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:35.000
Can we issue Tom Malcomson
with a gagging order?

551
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.080
You might want to do more than that.

552
00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:40.760
I have RTE holding on line one.
You cannot be serious.

553
00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:43.920
Their Northern editor wants to run
the story in the news tonight.

554
00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:46.080
None of them seem to care
that a 92-year-old

555
00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:48.480
might be lying in a ditch somewhere.

556
00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:51.360
Have you tried Artie's family again?
They still haven't heard a thing.

557
00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:53.760
What about the police?
They've checked with the airlines.

558
00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:55.480
No bookings under his name.

559
00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:58.680
So if Artie IS trying
to get to France. he's not flying.

560
00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:19.400
Oh.

561
00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:29.600
Right.

562
00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:37.240
'Absolutely.'

Come on. Artie!

Good morning.

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:22.720
Artie!

586
00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:32.000
Your blood pressure's very low.

587
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.080
Without knowing
what medication you're on.

588
00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:35.800
I can't prescribe you anything.

589
00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:37.840
We really need
to contact your doctor.

590
00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:39.840
Oh. no. no. no. no. No. no.

591
00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:41.680
How's our patient doing?

592
00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:43.960
He needs to get to a hospital
for a full check-up.

593
00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:47.240
Well. we'll be in Cherbourg
in an hour. I'll radio ahead.

594
00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:49.000
So. tell me Mr...

595
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.800
Crawford.
how did you get on board our vessel

596
00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:55.640
with an out-of-date passport?

597
00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:57.640
You do know
this is a criminal offence...

598
00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:59.560
What's my sentence. huh?

599
00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:01.360
Life?

600
00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:04.080
I'm still gonna have
to contact the authorities

601
00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:06.200
to let them know we have a stowaway.

602
00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:08.400
A 92-year-old stowaway.

603
00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:10.760
92 and three-quarters.

604
00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:13.440
We'll have an ambulance
meet you at Cherbourg.

605
00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.640
In the meantime. don't go anywhere.

606
00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:18.640
Aye.

607
00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:27.360
I can't believe it.

608
00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:29.400
After getting this far.

609
00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:32.120
I can't go back.

610
00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:34.280
I can't give up now.

611
00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:36.680
Looks like
you don't have much of a choice.

612
00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:45.680
It's my mother...

613
00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:50.320
arranging to collect
the children at the weekend.

614
00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:53.880
It's back to reality for both of us.
it seems.

615
00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:58.000
What's your reality?

616
00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:04.200
When we return.
I go into hospital...

617
00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:06.240
for a procedure.

618
00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:08.280
I'm sure it'll be fine.

619
00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:11.240
The doctor's optimistic

620
00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:15.640
and they have success now
treating that kind of...

621
00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:18.640
It'll be fine. I'm sure.

622
00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:24.920
The holiday was to help
take the children's minds off it.

623
00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:28.600
Jacques is small
- he doesn't understand -

624
00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:30.640
but it's been hard on Sophie.

625
00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:33.800
She worries.

626
00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:35.840
So I worry about her.

627
00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:39.680
And the father?

628
00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:42.120
Hmm.

629
00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:43.840
It's just us -

630
00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:45.880
Les Trois Mousquetaires.

631
00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:48.040
Us Three Musketeers.

632
00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:14.600
'Hello. How can I place your call?'

633
00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:16.480
Hello.
Hello.

634
00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:18.400
'Hello?

635
00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:20.960
Hello. sir?

636
00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:23.320
Sir. can I help you?'

637
00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:30.680
Witch.

638
00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:48.240
Mr Crawford?

639
00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:59.320
Oui?

640
00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:10.840
Merci.

641
00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:45.880
Passeport. si'l vous plait.

642
00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:47.600
Merci.

643
00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:42.960
Good luck.

644
00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:45.800
Oh. thank you.

645
00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:47.520
Smile. Artie.

646
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000
Getting close.

647
00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:29.280
Ladies and gentlemen.

648
00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:31.240
we are about to commence
our approach to Paris.

649
00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:33.160
Charles de Gaulle.
Please return to your seats

650
00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:34.880
and ensure
your seatbelts are fastened.

651
00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:37.240
your tray tables are stowed
and your seat back is upright.

652
00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:40.800
Mate. Excuse me. mate.
I'm burstin'. Thanks.

653
00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:56.880

654

Merci.

655
00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:23.680
Oh. no.

656
00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:25.720
Oh. my God.

657
00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:04.240
Take one?

658
00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:06.280
No. thank you.

659
00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:21.640
Oh.

660
00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:26.160
Doo-do!

661
00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:55.600
Whaaaa-whaaa!

662
00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:07.960
Do you like ice cream?

663
00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:13.840
Hmm.

664
00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:20.280
Thank you.

Er. er...

00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:31.520
two 99's.

670
00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:33.720
Artie?
Raspberry ripple.

671
00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:36.720
Oh. raspberry ripple. Of course!
How could I forget that?

672
00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:39.200
Two 99's. please.
with raspberry ripple.

673
00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:41.160
and don't hold back
on the raspberry.

674
00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:43.200
No. don't do that.

675
00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:49.640
Oh.

676
00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:51.400
Artie.

677
00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:56.240
Artie. can you hear me?

678
00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:57.960
Hmm. What?

679
00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:00.120
Do you like ice cream?

680
00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:02.440
Hmm. yes.

681
00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:06.400
I like ice cream.

682
00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:09.720
I do too.

683
00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:14.880
Oh. look at this. Tres.

684
00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:16.800
Oh. that's a feast.

685
00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:18.520
Even.

686
00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:20.240
Thank you.

687
00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:22.280
Merci.

688
00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:31.400
Cheers.
Thank you.

689
00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:35.920
My.

690
00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:37.960
So. what you're saying is

691
00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:40.040
they found my father?

692
00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:43.120
Yes.
And then lost him again?

693
00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:46.600
We don't quite know what happened.
but the authorities on both sides

694
00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:49.320
have assured me
they're doing everything they can.

695
00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:52.640
My father has just lost
his wife of 68 years.

696
00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:56.160
I can't even begin to imagine
the pain he's feeling right now.

697
00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:59.800
So. if he has gone back to France
after all these years. then...

698
00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:03.200
...he must have a very good reason.

699
00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:10.400
Going somewhere. Tom?

700
00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:12.640
What. me? Huh.

701
00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:14.720
You know what she said.

702
00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:16.760
What - that I am under house arrest?

703
00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:19.120
I suggested shackles and chains.

704
00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:21.400
But apparently. there's laws.

705
00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:23.720
What about my phone?

706
00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:26.000
Ah. you'll get it back...

707
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.040
once you're longer
a threat to society.

708
00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:36.320
So I have good news.

709
00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:38.640
There's a tour bus of veterans.
Uh-huh.

710
00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:41.200
And they're happy
to drop you off at Cambes-en-Plaine.

711
00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:42.960
Oh. that's great news.

712
00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:45.440
Which regiment?
The Scottish Borderers?

713
00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:47.160
Um...
The Staffordshires?

714
00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:49.200
Not exactly.

715
00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:57.400
Germans?

716
00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:59.120
I'm sorry. Artie.

717
00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:01.280
I would take you.
but we have to go south.

718
00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:03.320
Aye. b...

719
00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:06.480
Bloody Germans.

720
00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:08.520
They were soldiers. just like you.

721
00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:10.680
Ah. but... Aye.

722
00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:12.720
Are you going to be OK?

723
00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:16.080
I'll be fine.

724
00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:18.320
I'm still fit enough
to take on a few old Jerries.

725
00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:23.840
Bonne chance.
Bonne chance.

726
00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:28.640
Don't you worry now
about Sophie or Jacques.

727
00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:30.360
They're going to be fine.

728
00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:33.200
I promise you now.

729
00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:44.400
Oh. thank you. Sophie.

730
00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:46.200
You take care of your mother now.

731
00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:48.680
OK?
I will. I will.

732
00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:50.720
She'll be fine.

733
00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:32.320
What the f...

734
00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:34.960
Mate. I'm stuck here.

735
00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:41.880
Me no speak no other language. mate.

736
00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:48.720
Ah. come on!

737
00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:01.360
Friedrich Mueller.

738
01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:03.320
Berlin.

739
01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:06.600
Artie Crawford.
Pleased to meet you.

740
01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.400
Belfast.

741
01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.320
12th Panzer Division?

742
01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:12.120
Yes.

743
01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:15.600
12th SS Panzer Division.

744
01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:20.400
At the end of the war.
you had little choice.

745
01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:23.360
Hitlerjugend?
I was in the Hitler Youth.

746
01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.960
Were you not in the Boy Scouts?
Hmm.

747
01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:29.320
A boy of 12
is looking for adventure.

748
01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:32.720
In Berlin... or Belfast.

749
01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:42.600
I was 14 when
I graduated into the Hitler Youth.

750
01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.360
It was the proudest day.

751
01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:48.040
To feel important
for the first time in my life.

752
01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:51.200
People would salute me
in the street.

753
01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:53.600
treat me like
I was some kind of a hero.

754
01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:56.800
The girls.

755
01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:01.240
Then at 16.
I was drafted into the SS.

756
01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:03.680
sent to Normandy...

757
01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.720
and everything changed.

758
01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:08.480
You murdered innocent men.

759
01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.520
Soldiers who lay wounded.

760
01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:14.560
dying.

761
01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:16.440
Murder is a strong word.

762
01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:18.160
Medics who tried to help.

763
01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.880
shot in cold blood.

764
01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:24.240
It was war.
Aye. it was war.

765
01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:27.120
And there were rules.

766
01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:30.120
We knew nothing of rules.

767
01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.880
We were just boys.

768
01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:35.160
We were all just boys.

769
01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:42.320
You're right.

770
01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:45.320
I saw terrible things.

771
01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:48.280
We did terrible things.

772
01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:51.840
And I've had to live with that.

773
01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:53.880
Aye. we all have.

774
01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:58.840
We all have.

775
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.880
It's a shock to learn
you've lost the war.

776
01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:12.240
It's a greater shock

777
01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:15.280
to discover
you've been on the wrong side.

778
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Friends of yours?

779
01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:53.760
75 years ago.
we tried to kill each other.

780
01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:57.920
None of us can ever forget.

781
01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.920
But maybe...

782
01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:02.880
we can forgive.

784
01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:42.160

Artie.

792
01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:35.760
Perhaps another place...

793
01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:38.000
in another time.

794
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.120
we might have drank
a schnapps together.

795
01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:45.200
Aye.

796
01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:46.920
Perhaps.

797
01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:45.760
Oh. please check again.

798
01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:48.720
The Royal Ulster Rifles Regiment

799
01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:50.360
from Northern Ireland.
I am sorry.

800
01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:52.200
but there are no services
for that regiment.

801
01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:55.040
What? Well. maybe you've got
the wrong programme there.

802
01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:57.680
Maybe your regiment
did not attend this year?

803
01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:00.200
No. no. no. no.
They always come back here.

804
01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:04.560
The Second Battalion Royal Ulster
Rifles always comes back here.

805
01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:06.560
Unless it is
an unofficial visit. Monsieur.

806
01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:08.480
Sometimes that happens.

807
01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:10.840
There were some Americans here
this morning and...

808
01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:29.160
Bonjour.
Bonjour.

809
01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:31.440
Have you seen this man?

810
01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:33.480
No. no.

811
01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.800
Ooh.

812
01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:22.680
Oh!

813
01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:29.840
Excuse me a minute. Melanie. I...

814
01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:33.960
Excuse. sir.

815
01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:35.920
Do you mind if I join you?

816
01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:39.080
You look like
you could be needing some company.

817
01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:41.120
I know I could.

818
01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:47.680
Corporal Lincoln Jefferson Adams.
United States Army.

819
01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:49.720
Artie Crawford.

820
01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:52.240
British Army.

821
01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:55.160
An honour to meet you. Artie.

822
01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:57.200
My granddaughter Melanie here believes

823
01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:58.920
I shouldn't be bothering people.

824
01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:01.680
but I keep telling her.
at our age...

825
01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:03.600
...life's too short not to.

826
01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:06.440
Nice to meet you. Artie.
Nice to meet you.

827
01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:08.760
Which unit would you be in?

828
01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:11.480
2nd Battalion.

829
01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:13.480
Royal Ulster Rifles.

830
01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:15.520
Infantryman. huh?

831
01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:17.640
I was artillery myself.

832
01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:21.320
320th Barrage Balloon Battalion -

833
01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:23.760
anti-aircraft balloons.

834
01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:25.480
You'd looked up on D-Day.

835
01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:27.240
you'd have seen them for sure.

836
01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:28.520
Hmm.

837
01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:30.880
Er. in fact...

838
01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:36.520
...there you go.

839
01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:38.240
Oh. look at that.

840
01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:40.040
Fine sight. wouldn't you say?

841
01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:41.720
Oh. aye.

842
01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:44.000
Might have just been
big gas balloons.

843
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.080
but they could kept
those dive bombers off the beaches.

844
01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:49.760
Now. that's me at the back.

845
01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:53.200
and that's my little brother
Ulysses Quincy Adams.

846
01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:56.760
We signed up the very same day.

847
01:08:56.760 --> 01:09:02.320
The 320th was the only all-black
combat unit in Normandy on D-Day.

848
01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:05.480
The. er. Buffalo Soldiers regiment?
Hell. no!

849
01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:07.240
That's the 92nd.

850
01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:09.440
They were sunning
their pretty selves in Italy.

851
01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:12.360
while we were on the beaches
in Normandy catching hell.

852
01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:14.480
Ah...

853
01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:17.120
Melanie. step here a minute.
will you. hon?

854
01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:21.840
Would you like a drink. Artie?
Grandpa!

855
01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:25.440
I'm just being polite. honey.

856
01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:27.200
Whisky maybe?
Lincoln.

857
01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:30.320
Two Jack Daniels. Melanie.
That is. if you don't mind.

858
01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:35.360
Grandchildren.

859
01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:44.480
Bonjour.

860
01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:46.680
Please tell me you've seen this guy.
Oui. oui.

861
01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:49.760
He was here. like.
15. 20 minutes ago.

862
01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:52.640
You're kidding?
No. no. he went that way.

863
01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:54.400
Merci beaucoup.

864
01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:56.400
De rien.

865
01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:58.440
I got given a medal today.

866
01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:03.200
The first African-American
combat soldier to set foot on Omaha.

867
01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:07.960
They even installed a balloon
over Omaha Beach in my honour.

868
01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:10.000
Wasn't that nice?

869
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.600
I met this SS veteran today.

870
01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:14.320
You're kidding me.

871
01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:16.360
But the thing is...

872
01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:20.960
...he wasn't a bad sort.
None of them are.

873
01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:23.680
not after
getting their asses whipped. hmm?

874
01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:29.240
First and last today. Grandpa. OK?

875
01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:50.160
The first time
we ever tried to take Cambes Wood.

876
01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:53.760
oh. we got a hammering. we did.

877
01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:57.320
Charlie and me.

878
01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:03.960
We were sheltering in a ditch
with this English fella.

879
01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:08.400
He was a lot older than us.
Big Goliath of a fella.

880
01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:13.520
I was terrified.

881
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.600
The shelling and the mortaring
and all of it.

882
01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:24.600
So. this English boy.
he puts his arms around me.

883
01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:27.080
you know. to comfort me.

884
01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:29.440
And you know what?

885
01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:31.480
I could feel him trembling.

886
01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:35.320
Really trembling.

887
01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:38.960
Oh...

888
01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:42.000
and that frightened me
more than all the shelling did.

889
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.680
You know. scared me.

890
01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:46.960
Knowing that he was frightened too.

891
01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:50.960
Aye.

892
01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:58.000
A child can't take comfort
in a frightened adult.

893
01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:02.080
And we were all just children then.

894
01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:07.880
Just... wee boys.

895
01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:11.360
We were all scared to death.

896
01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:14.200
Anyone tell you otherwise
is just a damned liar.

897
01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:18.560
That's the truth.

898
01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:22.680
I'm afraid it's time to go. Grandpa.
The bus is leaving soon.

899
01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:24.400
Mm-hmm.

900
01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:32.680
I told you I was the first
African-American on Omaha that day.

901
01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:36.400
I was the second.

902
01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:39.120
My little brother went before me.

903
01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:41.280
First down the ramp.

904
01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:43.320
First into the water.

905
01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:45.360
First to get his head blown off.

906
01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:48.360
And they gave ME the medal.

907
01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:54.400
That's the thing
about folks like us. Artie.

908
01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:56.600
We're all living with ghosts.

909
01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:44.560
Artie Crawford?
Aye.

910
01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:46.920
Tony McCann. Irish Journal. Oh.

911
01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:49.680
I've been looking everywhere
for you. Mind if I join you?

912
01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:54.880
Artie. you've caused quite the stir.

913
01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:56.720
I didn't think you'd make it.
to be honest.

914
01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:59.160
What are you talking about?
I'm doing a story on D-Day.

915
01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:01.720
but it's really about you -
your crazy journey to get here.

916
01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:03.440
gallivanting around Europe.

917
01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:05.240
You're a celebrity.
all over the news.

918
01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:06.960
"The Last Rifleman."

919
01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:08.760
The Last Rifleman?

920
01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:10.640
That's gonna be my headline.

921
01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:13.040
Kind of like
The Last Of The Mohicans. you know.

922
01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:15.720
What do you mean - the last?

923
01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:17.640
They say
you're the last of your regiment.

924
01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:19.440
You mean. the 2nd Battalion?

925
01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:21.400
No. I mean ALL of the battalions.

926
01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:27.120
Oh. oh. no. no. no. you're mistaken.

927
01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:29.160
I thought you knew.

928
01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:31.200
Well. the others will be here.

929
01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:32.920
Artie...
There will be others here.

930
01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:36.000
- They always are.
- Artie...
You're wrong. You're wrong.

931
01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.720
Artie.
What?

932
01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:39.440
There are no others.

933
01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:41.080
You're the last of them.

934
01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:44.120
The last of the Royal Ulster Rifles.

935
01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:50.520
- No.
- Artie.

936
01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:13.720
Jesus Christ!

937
01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:22.040
Free fire!

938
01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:41.880
Artie. come on!

939
01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:54.680
Artie. come on!

940
01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:17.520
You are quite the soldier.
Monsieur Crawford.

941
01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:21.840
Without your medication. it is
a miracle that you made it this far.

942
01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:25.040
We contacted your nursing home.

943
01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:28.160
There is already someone on
- their way here to take you back.
- Oh.

944
01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:31.120
I am afraid. for you.
the celebrations are over.

945
01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:33.960
No more running around the country. Monsieur.

946
01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:35.920
And no more whisky.

947
01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:41.280
This fell out of your jacket
in the ambulance.

948
01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:44.320
This Charlie...

949
01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:46.040
you need us to contact him for you?

950
01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:49.520
No.

951
01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:51.560
It's too late now.

952
01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:54.760
Thank you.

953
01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:03.440
Oh.

954
01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:27.080
Jesus. Artie. I've never seen
someone faint before.

955
01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:29.160
Scared the crap out of me.

956
01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:33.040
What do you want?

957
01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:35.120
I am just following
the hero's story.

958
01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:37.200
Don't shoot the messenger.

959
01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:40.880
There ain't no hero.

960
01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:45.600
I killed my best friend.

961
01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:49.080
Aye.

962
01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:51.120
Yeah. I thought that would grab you.

963
01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:01.760
Back in the war.

964
01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:03.800
just a few miles from here.

965
01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:07.400
Aye.
we were getting hit from all sides.

966
01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:09.800
I was terrified.

967
01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:14.320
But Charlie...

968
01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:16.360
he wouldn't go on without me.

969
01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:19.880
He was like a brother.

970
01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:23.280
If he'd kept on going.

971
01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:27.240
if he'd only just kept on going.
he would have been fine.

972
01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:33.160
But he turned back.

973
01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:40.640
He just got blown to pieces
right before my eyes.

974
01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:43.400
And all because...

975
01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:45.120
because of me.

976
01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:48.560
Well. how's that your fault?

977
01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:52.360
You don't understand.

978
01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:55.040
There was a war.

979
01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:56.760
Shit happens. Loads of people die.

980
01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:58.680
I was scared. alright?

981
01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:00.840
How does that
fit into your big hero story?

982
01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:02.920
You tell me. huh?

983
01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.960
Go away. Go away.

984
01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:25.560
Artie.

985
01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:27.040
What are you doing lying here?

986
01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:31.440
Oh.

987
01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:36.480
Bonjour.
Bonjour.

988
01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:28.400
Go on. Finish what you came for.

989
01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:32.800
What?

990
01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:35.000
So you can finish YOUR story?

991
01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.600
Well.
every man's got to earn a living.

992
01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:40.760
Aye.

993
01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:24.600
My God.

994
01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:26.680
so many young lads.

995
01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:29.040
Local fellas from back home.

996
01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:31.760
I had no idea.

997
01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:35.600
Aye. we all wrote letters.
so we did...

998
01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:39.680
...before heading to France.

999
01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:41.720
just in case we got killed.

1000
01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:45.880
Charlie had just got engaged.

1001
01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:49.680
He wouldn't write a goodbye letter.

1002
01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:51.400
Thought it was bad luck.

1003
01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:55.160
So. after he died.

1004
01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:57.760
I wrote Charlie's letter.

1005
01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:00.000
and when I got home.

1006
01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.520
I gave it to Maggie.

1007
01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:04.240
Oh...

1008
01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:06.560
she was heartbroken.

1009
01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:09.640
But the letter
gave her some comfort.

1010
01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:12.640
You see...

1011
01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:16.760
...Maggie had always been
Charlie's girl...

1012
01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:20.680
...even when they were little.

1013
01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:25.120
So. he got to tell her that
in his letter.

1014
01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:29.360
The letter she kept.

1015
01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:36.160
Er. Maggie and me...

1016
01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:41.240
...we'd been together
for 68 years before she passed.

1017
01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:44.920
68 happy years.

1018
01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:50.360
But she would've married Charlie.
if he'd lived.

1019
01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:59.840
And I've had
to live with that all my life.

1020
01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:08.040
Oh...

1021
01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:31.320
I'm sorry. Charlie.

1022
01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:34.560
My good friend.

1023
01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:38.920
I'll see you soon.

1024
01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Dear Charlie.

1025
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.200
when you get this letter.

1026
01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:19.240
you will know
my time has also come.

1027
01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:24.960
Some of us
live long and full lives.

1028
01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:30.000
Others live
shorter. perhaps fuller lives.

1029
01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:34.880
We had such good times together.

1030
01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:39.080
Looking back on them now.

1031
01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:42.640
I can honestly say they were some
of the happiest days of my life.

1032
01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:47.360
We were young and carefree.

1033
01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:49.960
and the world
was there for the taking.

1034
01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:53.840
Or so we thought.

1035
01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:59.040
Not everything
works out the way you'd expect.

1036
01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:02.600
Fate intervenes.

1037
01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:05.720
for better or for worse.

1038
01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:12.920
I am not sad. Charlie.

1039
01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:15.080
I've had a happy life.

1040
01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:17.720
Artie has been a good husband to me.

1041
01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:22.320
He has loved me and cared for me.

1042
01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:25.160
even if he often thought
he was second best.

1043
01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:29.040
But we mustn't have regrets.

1044
01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:33.560
Only gratitude
for a life well-lived.

1045
01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:37.480
We'll all be together again soon.

1046
01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:42.160
The Three Musketeers
of East Belfast.

1047
01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:46.120
Until then. Charlie.

1048
01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:48.640
all for one and one for all.

1049
01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:53.120
Yours. forever with love...

1050
01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:56.600
Maggie.
