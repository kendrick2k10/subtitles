3
00:00:31.585 --> 00:00:34.502
- This journey really started
back in 2011.

4
00:00:34.585 --> 00:00:37.460
We'd been living in China
for about five years

5
00:00:37.543 --> 00:00:40.001
traveling and reporting
for "The Atlantic" magazine.

6
00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:45.043
When we came back to the U.S..

7
00:00:45.126 --> 00:00:48.210
we wanted to look at
our own country the same way.

8
00:00:48.293 --> 00:00:51.543
- We're coming back
at the end of the recession.

9
00:00:51.627 --> 00:00:53.835
America was still trying
to find its balance.

10
00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:56.085
trying to find its way back.

11
00:00:56.168 --> 00:00:59.085
We decided to go out
and see what was going on

12
00:00:59.168 --> 00:01:02.210
in small-town
or even big-town America.

13
00:01:02.293 --> 00:01:03.543
- We were looking for towns

14
00:01:03.627 --> 00:01:05.752
that had some kind of story
to tell.

15
00:01:05.835 --> 00:01:07.752
Something had happened
to them.

16
00:01:07.835 --> 00:01:11.877
often involving
some economic shock.

17
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.210
- Jim put a posting
on his blog...

18
00:01:14.293 --> 00:01:16.543
- Saying. "Tell us the story
of your town."

19
00:01:16.627 --> 00:01:19.669
Within a week.
we got a thousand essays.

20
00:01:19.752 --> 00:01:20.669
people saying...

21
00:01:20.752 --> 00:01:22.043
- Not just. "Come to my town."

22
00:01:22.126 --> 00:01:23.877
but. "Here's the story
of my town.

23
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.418
"Here's the passion
of my town.

24
00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:27.627
Here's why you have to come
and visit my town."

25
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.377
- "Here is why
the story of my town

26
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.168
is the American story
of this era."

27
00:01:33.251 --> 00:01:35.960
- We thought there must be
something going on in America

28
00:01:36.043 --> 00:01:39.377
that so many people wanted
to talk about their hometowns.

29
00:01:41.502 --> 00:01:43.251
We had a little plane

30
00:01:43.335 --> 00:01:45.919
that we'd been flying
for about 20 years

31
00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:48.752
and thought. "This would be
a great way to go to places

32
00:01:48.835 --> 00:01:52.460
where you can only get to
easily in a small plane."

33
00:01:52.543 --> 00:01:56.043
We decided to do what
we had always done in China.

34
00:01:56.126 --> 00:01:59.460
Go out. get connected
with not what you'd find

35
00:01:59.543 --> 00:02:02.251
in the national media.
but what we would find

36
00:02:02.335 --> 00:02:05.251
in the daily lives of people
in these towns.

37
00:02:10.251 --> 00:02:13.418
- We went to these places
before the pandemic.

38
00:02:13.502 --> 00:02:18.001
but what we saw
about how towns rise and fall

39
00:02:18.085 --> 00:02:23.126
and fight to recover has a lot
to say to our world right now

40
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.335
as we try to create
a new future for ourselves.

41
00:03:33.293 --> 00:03:34.835
- When people ask me
where I'm from.

42
00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:37.377
I always say
I'm from California.

43
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.877
They say. "Well. where?"
and I say. "Near Los Angeles."

44
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.877
They say. "Well. where?"

45
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.168
I say. "Well.
from the Inland Empire."

46
00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:47.919
And that will stop 'em
because the Inland Empire

47
00:03:48.001 --> 00:03:50.043
is a place
that people don't know.

48
00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.710
Start driving inland
from Los Angeles

49
00:03:58.794 --> 00:04:00.418
towards Palm Springs.

50
00:04:00.502 --> 00:04:01.710
You get to the area where

51
00:04:01.794 --> 00:04:03.919
it's much flatter.
it's much hotter.

52
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:06.919
It's sort of just the fringe
of the Mojave Desert.

53
00:04:09.168 --> 00:04:12.627
People in Los Angeles
or San Francisco would think

54
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.752
that's where the hicks
of California live

55
00:04:14.835 --> 00:04:16.752
and just zoom on through

56
00:04:16.835 --> 00:04:20.460
when they see what looks like
some sun-blasted hellscape.

57
00:04:24.502 --> 00:04:29.710
I think being from here has
really shaped my self-image

58
00:04:29.794 --> 00:04:32.251
as a sense of being
from a place

59
00:04:32.335 --> 00:04:34.919
most people have either
never heard of

60
00:04:35.001 --> 00:04:38.627
or if they have heard of it.
they often look down on it.

61
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.460
I knew growing up how proud
people in our town were

62
00:04:42.543 --> 00:04:44.794
of a place
everybody else thought of

63
00:04:44.877 --> 00:04:48.251
just as drive-through country
or flyover country.

64
00:04:48.335 --> 00:04:50.585
As Deb and I have gone
to other parts of the country.

65
00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.585
I feel as if. "Yeah.
I know what it's like

66
00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:53.710
"here in South Dakota.

67
00:04:53.794 --> 00:04:55.960
I know what it's like
here in West Virginia"--

68
00:04:56.043 --> 00:05:00.251
the same pride and awareness
of how you're seen.

69
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.001
My own hometown is Redlands.

70
00:05:06.085 --> 00:05:09.460
which is near Riverside.
which is growing.

71
00:05:09.543 --> 00:05:14.168
and San Bernardino. which used
to be the economic powerhouse

72
00:05:14.251 --> 00:05:16.085
of the Inland Empire.

73
00:05:19.794 --> 00:05:21.585
But San Bernardino
was brought down

74
00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:26.001
by a long string of problems
and seriously bad luck.

75
00:05:26.085 --> 00:05:27.418
How many cities

76
00:05:27.502 --> 00:05:31.752
have had an interstate highway
literally move away from them?

77
00:05:42.877 --> 00:05:44.669
- When Jim was growing up.

78
00:05:44.752 --> 00:05:47.210
this was
Norton Air Force Base.

79
00:05:50.085 --> 00:05:54.502
At its peak.
Norton supported 12.000 jobs

80
00:05:54.585 --> 00:05:56.293
and poured a couple
of billion dollars

81
00:05:56.377 --> 00:05:58.043
into the surrounding towns.

82
00:06:01.126 --> 00:06:04.043
The base closed in '94.

83
00:06:04.126 --> 00:06:06.543
Now it's home
to a scrapyard for old planes

84
00:06:06.627 --> 00:06:09.669
that will never fly again.

85
00:06:09.752 --> 00:06:11.335
After all its losses.

86
00:06:11.418 --> 00:06:16.168
San Bernardino
declared bankruptcy in 2012.

87
00:06:22.502 --> 00:06:25.877
- I've spent most of my life
in San Bernardino.

88
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.085
This place was thriving
when the base was open.

89
00:06:28.168 --> 00:06:29.543
When the base closed down.

90
00:06:29.627 --> 00:06:32.502
it put us
in an economic chokehold.

91
00:06:32.585 --> 00:06:34.085
San Bernardino
gets a black eye

92
00:06:34.168 --> 00:06:36.126
because. you know. we had
the terrorist shootings.

93
00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.710
There's a lot
of gang activity.

94
00:06:39.794 --> 00:06:42.001
So this is the neighborhood
that we live in.

95
00:06:46.543 --> 00:06:48.335
- This is
Project Fighting Chance.

96
00:06:48.418 --> 00:06:50.418
We have
five national champions.

97
00:06:50.502 --> 00:06:53.001
a junior Olympic
gold medalist.

98
00:06:53.085 --> 00:06:55.919
We're a safe haven.
We feed the kids.

99
00:06:56.001 --> 00:06:58.043
We have a chess club.
We have a art program.

100
00:06:58.126 --> 00:07:00.085
- Can I get a light blue?

101
00:07:00.168 --> 00:07:02.877
- We have our Guitars Not Guns
program.

102
00:07:05.627 --> 00:07:07.251
- I knew there was a catch.

103
00:07:07.335 --> 00:07:09.919
- There's always a catch. buddy.

104
00:07:10.001 --> 00:07:11.919
- They think. "Oh.
this is just a boxing gym."

105
00:07:12.001 --> 00:07:13.877
But that's far from the truth.

106
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.669
We are trying to be a part

107
00:07:15.752 --> 00:07:18.585
of fixing what needs
to be fixed around here.

108
00:07:27.001 --> 00:07:28.752
- A lot
of America's citrus fruits

109
00:07:28.835 --> 00:07:31.377
come from the Inland Empire.

110
00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:34.585
The groves and packing houses

111
00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:36.251
have relied
on immigrant workers

112
00:07:36.335 --> 00:07:39.043
and been a source of jobs
for them.

113
00:07:39.126 --> 00:07:42.460
- When I grew up in Mexico.
we barely could afford shoes.

114
00:07:42.543 --> 00:07:46.669
My dad picked the family up.
we traveled to California.

115
00:07:46.752 --> 00:07:50.835
I've been in the
citrus business for 45 years.

116
00:07:50.919 --> 00:07:52.669
I started when
I was 15 years old.

117
00:07:52.752 --> 00:07:55.794
Now I am the manager
at Redlands Foothill Groves

118
00:07:55.877 --> 00:07:58.168
and probably
the biggest grower.

119
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:10.126
The people that work here.
99% are immigrant people.

120
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:13.794
They do go back to Mexico.
like. mainly for Christmas.

121
00:08:13.877 --> 00:08:16.460
But we have employees
that have been with us

122
00:08:16.543 --> 00:08:19.502
over 30 years. and
that's really hard to find.

123
00:08:21.043 --> 00:08:24.669
I've seen a big change
in the last two. three years.

124
00:08:24.752 --> 00:08:26.794
We used to have people
waiting in line

125
00:08:26.877 --> 00:08:28.752
to go and pick in the field.

126
00:08:28.835 --> 00:08:32.001
Right now if I need
two people by tomorrow.

127
00:08:32.085 --> 00:08:35.502
I'll be lucky to get one
if I do.

128
00:08:35.585 --> 00:08:38.335
The lack of labor
is forcing us a lot

129
00:08:38.418 --> 00:08:41.293
to look
for automatic machines.

130
00:08:41.377 --> 00:08:43.335
I know of one packing house.

131
00:08:43.418 --> 00:08:46.502
they run almost
with no people now--

132
00:08:46.585 --> 00:08:48.919
all automatic.

133
00:09:02.293 --> 00:09:04.543
- A huge amount of the stuff
we all buy

134
00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:07.502
is made in Asia.
shipped through LA.

135
00:09:07.585 --> 00:09:09.293
then brought
to the Inland Empire

136
00:09:09.377 --> 00:09:11.251
for distribution
to the rest of the country.

137
00:09:13.794 --> 00:09:18.585
Land here is flat and cheap--
perfect for warehouses.

138
00:09:18.669 --> 00:09:20.877
For San Bernardino
to get back on its feet.

139
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.418
new jobs
for warehouse workers.

140
00:09:23.502 --> 00:09:25.752
delivery people.
and truckers are critical.

141
00:09:27.794 --> 00:09:29.168
But those jobs are also

142
00:09:29.251 --> 00:09:32.543
the ones most at risk
for being automated.

143
00:09:32.627 --> 00:09:34.752
- We're expecting
that the future of automation

144
00:09:34.835 --> 00:09:37.001
will attack specifically
those jobs.

145
00:09:37.085 --> 00:09:40.669
Think about
self-driving trucks...

146
00:09:40.752 --> 00:09:43.335
the levels of automation
in the warehouses.

147
00:09:43.418 --> 00:09:46.085
office. sales jobs.
restaurants--

148
00:09:46.168 --> 00:09:49.377
income inequality will worsen.

149
00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.543
So. if we don't manage to get
an area like San Bernardino

150
00:09:52.627 --> 00:09:56.251
back on its feet.
it will be really troublesome.

151
00:09:56.335 --> 00:09:58.085
because then all
the other areas

152
00:09:58.168 --> 00:10:01.251
will also get into
economic hardship.

153
00:10:03.001 --> 00:10:05.377
And just think
about what will happen

154
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.919
if places like Minnesota
or Michigan in the winter

155
00:10:09.001 --> 00:10:10.919
see large levels
of unemployment

156
00:10:11.001 --> 00:10:14.085
and possibly
forced homelessness

157
00:10:14.168 --> 00:10:15.585
for economic reasons.

158
00:10:15.669 --> 00:10:18.585
They're not going to stay
in Michigan in January.

159
00:10:18.669 --> 00:10:20.960
They will come south
into the sun.

160
00:10:34.418 --> 00:10:35.794
- We've seen homelessness

161
00:10:35.877 --> 00:10:38.001
everywhere we've been
in the U.S.

162
00:10:38.085 --> 00:10:41.585
It's especially bad
in California.

163
00:10:41.669 --> 00:10:45.585
Volunteers in San Bernardino
take part in an annual census

164
00:10:45.669 --> 00:10:48.627
to count people
experiencing homelessness.

165
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:52.835
It's a national program called
in the Point-in-Time Count.

166
00:10:52.919 --> 00:10:54.585
- Good morning.
all: Good morning.

167
00:10:54.669 --> 00:10:57.377
Everybody nice and warm?
Ready to hit the streets here?

168
00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.919
I cannot thank you enough
for what you're doing

169
00:11:00.001 --> 00:11:03.418
so we can help those people
that are out there.

170
00:11:03.502 --> 00:11:04.752
Without you counting them.

171
00:11:04.835 --> 00:11:06.960
showing us where they are.
who they are.

172
00:11:07.043 --> 00:11:10.001
we can't get the resources
to them to help them.

173
00:11:10.085 --> 00:11:11.168
- Hello.
Good morning.

174
00:11:11.251 --> 00:11:13.168
- Good morning. sir.
- Good morning. sir.

175
00:11:13.251 --> 00:11:15.835
- Be extremely careful.
You're waking somebody up.

176
00:11:15.919 --> 00:11:18.001
Maybe you're walking
into a camp.

177
00:11:18.085 --> 00:11:20.251
Just like somebody walking
into your living room.

178
00:11:20.335 --> 00:11:24.168
that's their little.
sacred area.

179
00:11:24.251 --> 00:11:26.043
- Would you mind taking
a survey with us?

180
00:11:26.126 --> 00:11:27.126
- Sure.

181
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:28.669
- We have a film crew
from HBO here.

182
00:11:28.752 --> 00:11:31.460
Would you mind getting filmed?
- No.

183
00:11:34.502 --> 00:11:36.043
And how old are you?

184
00:11:36.126 --> 00:11:38.043
- 63.
- Okay.

185
00:11:38.126 --> 00:11:39.752
Did you sleep outdoors
last night?

186
00:11:39.835 --> 00:11:41.210
- Of course.

187
00:11:41.293 --> 00:11:44.960
I've been homeless 25 years.
- Wow.

188
00:11:45.043 --> 00:11:48.168
- I can't be indoors.
I don't know how to be indoors.

189
00:11:48.251 --> 00:11:50.710
- Do you have any income?

190
00:11:50.794 --> 00:11:53.919
- Retirement.
- Disability? Oh. retirement?

191
00:11:54.001 --> 00:11:55.251
How much per month
would you say?

192
00:11:55.335 --> 00:11:57.001
- 300.

193
00:11:57.085 --> 00:12:01.085
- I'm 60 years old.
August 21. 1958.

194
00:12:01.168 --> 00:12:04.877
- Oh. okay.
Hispanic or Latina?

195
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.210
- Azteca Mexicana.
Cherokee Indian.

196
00:12:07.293 --> 00:12:08.210
San Bernardino.

197
00:12:08.293 --> 00:12:10.043
- Native American. Okay.

198
00:12:10.126 --> 00:12:13.168
Do you have a spouse or partner
who is also homeless

199
00:12:13.251 --> 00:12:14.168
and living with you?

200
00:12:14.251 --> 00:12:15.543
- No.
- No?

201
00:12:15.627 --> 00:12:17.502
- I'm by myself.
- Mm.

202
00:12:19.085 --> 00:12:21.168
Have you tested positive
for HIV?

203
00:12:21.251 --> 00:12:22.543
- No.

204
00:12:22.627 --> 00:12:24.210
- Are you experiencing
homelessness

205
00:12:24.293 --> 00:12:26.210
because you're fleeing
domestic violence?

206
00:12:26.293 --> 00:12:28.335
- No.
My mother died.

207
00:12:30.085 --> 00:12:32.001
- A new application
that we're using

208
00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:36.377
is the ArcGIS 123
created by Esri.

209
00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:40.418
We are able to send live data
right there and then.

210
00:12:40.502 --> 00:12:42.752
- And that data is broadcast
up to a cloud.

211
00:12:42.835 --> 00:12:44.627
aggregated
so we can see patterns

212
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:47.085
and relationships
of homelessness on a map

213
00:12:47.168 --> 00:12:48.293
and on a dashboard.

214
00:12:48.377 --> 00:12:51.251
These inform government leaders
about the severity

215
00:12:51.335 --> 00:12:53.293
of what's going on
in the field.

216
00:12:53.377 --> 00:12:56.585
And the dots on maps
can be "inquiried."

217
00:12:56.669 --> 00:12:59.085
- Social services receive
that information right away

218
00:12:59.168 --> 00:13:02.377
so they are able to able
to reach out to these clients.

219
00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:06.460
- So we had someone
that was homeless for 40 years

220
00:13:06.543 --> 00:13:07.460
that we helped.

221
00:13:07.543 --> 00:13:09.251
And it took them a long time.

222
00:13:09.335 --> 00:13:10.627
but they're living
in an apartment.

223
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:12.085
- It takes a while. yeah.

224
00:13:12.168 --> 00:13:14.752
But. you know. like.
I can't afford no place.

225
00:13:14.835 --> 00:13:16.669
- No. but we have
affordable housing.

226
00:13:16.752 --> 00:13:18.502
Is that something
that you would be open to?

227
00:13:18.585 --> 00:13:22.001
- At $300 a month?
- It's only 30% of your income.

228
00:13:28.377 --> 00:13:29.919
- Thank you very much
for your time.

229
00:13:30.001 --> 00:13:31.627
- Thank you.
Thank you for your time.

230
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:33.502
- Here is a little goodie bag
for you.

231
00:13:33.585 --> 00:13:35.627
- Thank you. ladies. Thank you.
- Thank you for your time.

232
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:38.460
- We're gonna leave this bag
with you. okay?

233
00:13:41.543 --> 00:13:43.919
Well. my name's Maria.
- Okay.

234
00:13:44.001 --> 00:13:47.835
Just a homeless guy.

235
00:14:12.835 --> 00:14:15.669
- Through American history.

236
00:14:15.752 --> 00:14:18.001
the idea
of getting off the farm.

237
00:14:18.085 --> 00:14:19.543
getting out
of the little village.

238
00:14:19.627 --> 00:14:21.877
going to the big city.
testing yourself.

239
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.543
has been one
of the big themes.

240
00:14:24.627 --> 00:14:26.502
There's a reason why everybody
has heard about New York.

241
00:14:26.585 --> 00:14:27.460
If you can make it there.

242
00:14:27.543 --> 00:14:29.710
you can make it anywhere.
et cetera.

243
00:14:29.794 --> 00:14:32.126
It's slipped
from public awareness

244
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:34.085
how many people in America

245
00:14:34.168 --> 00:14:38.168
feel as if they could be
performing anyplace.

246
00:14:38.251 --> 00:14:40.043
but they place
they really want to perform

247
00:14:40.126 --> 00:14:42.001
is either where
they started out

248
00:14:42.085 --> 00:14:44.835
or some other place they feel
is their responsibility.

249
00:14:44.919 --> 00:14:46.877
And they want
to be there not just because

250
00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.043
it has great restaurants
or great street life.

251
00:14:49.126 --> 00:14:50.710
but because they can
help create

252
00:14:50.794 --> 00:14:53.043
great street life there.

253
00:14:53.126 --> 00:14:55.210
In this town of Redlands.
where I started out.

254
00:14:55.293 --> 00:14:57.877
a lot of the virtues
of the way it is now

255
00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.585
is because people
who could've been anyplace

256
00:15:00.669 --> 00:15:02.043
made that decision.

257
00:15:02.126 --> 00:15:06.669
- It's not a passive activity
to be a part of a community.

258
00:15:08.752 --> 00:15:11.877
One of the things about
Redlands I fell in love with

259
00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.210
is how people engage.

260
00:15:15.293 --> 00:15:17.085
- Clint Brown works at Esri.

261
00:15:17.168 --> 00:15:20.919
which makes the app used
in the homeless count.

262
00:15:21.001 --> 00:15:23.126
Esri is
a computer mapping company

263
00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:27.418
that adds a billion dollars
a year to the local economy.

264
00:15:27.502 --> 00:15:30.418
- Why is this company here
and not in Seattle

265
00:15:30.502 --> 00:15:32.085
or San Francisco or Boston

266
00:15:32.168 --> 00:15:33.126
or Brooklyn?

267
00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:34.085
- Oh. simple answer.

268
00:15:34.168 --> 00:15:36.460
We came from Redlands.

269
00:15:36.543 --> 00:15:39.085
We find it's a much better
place to live--

270
00:15:39.168 --> 00:15:40.251
smaller towns.

271
00:15:40.335 --> 00:15:42.210
much more affordable
for our employees.

272
00:15:42.293 --> 00:15:43.919
can actually afford a home.

273
00:15:44.001 --> 00:15:48.627
a much richer culture. and
a pace of life which is human.

274
00:15:55.543 --> 00:15:57.710
- When the French writer
Tocqueville toured America

275
00:15:57.794 --> 00:16:00.335
200 years ago.
what amazed him most

276
00:16:00.418 --> 00:16:03.877
was that everyone seemed
to be involved in everything.

277
00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:09.168
I'm struck by that same thing
in my town of Redlands.

278
00:16:10.835 --> 00:16:13.919
I took it for granted
when I was growing up.

279
00:16:16.543 --> 00:16:18.126
I did all these sorts
of things.

280
00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:20.627
I had jobs as a newspaper boy.

281
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:25.251
newspaper sports editor.
orange picker. mailman.

282
00:16:27.877 --> 00:16:30.460
- I'm from a Czech
immigrant family.

283
00:16:30.543 --> 00:16:31.835
I've always had a dream

284
00:16:31.919 --> 00:16:35.251
about going out
to see the rest of the world.

285
00:16:35.335 --> 00:16:37.460
It's not an unusual dream

286
00:16:37.543 --> 00:16:39.585
for people who grow up
in the Midwest

287
00:16:39.669 --> 00:16:41.669
like I did
in Vermillion. Ohio.

288
00:16:43.585 --> 00:16:47.001
First. you say Midwest
is a great place to grow up.

289
00:16:47.085 --> 00:16:50.001
On the other hand.
you really also knew

290
00:16:50.085 --> 00:16:52.335
that you needed to get out
and see the world.

291
00:16:54.919 --> 00:16:58.001
First visit to California
to see Jim's family.

292
00:16:58.085 --> 00:16:59.710
which was intimidating.

293
00:16:59.794 --> 00:17:01.835
Redlands itself was everything

294
00:17:01.919 --> 00:17:06.085
that I imagined California
would be and then some.

295
00:17:08.085 --> 00:17:10.877
- It's hard to explain what
Circus is in this community.

296
00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:11.960
I mean. you come to Redlands.

297
00:17:12.043 --> 00:17:16.543
and Redlands is known
as a circus town.

298
00:17:16.627 --> 00:17:18.585
You're driving around.
and on the side of the road.

299
00:17:18.669 --> 00:17:21.210
there's a kid riding
a unicycle.

300
00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:25.877
Circus is really important
to this community.

301
00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.877
because first of all.
it's a second family.

302
00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:32.335
You get in here. you meet
all these different people.

303
00:17:32.418 --> 00:17:34.210
- So how many kids have
you got in the program?

304
00:17:34.293 --> 00:17:37.377
- Right now
we are pushing 500.

305
00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.543
Um...

306
00:17:39.627 --> 00:17:42.210
- Yes.

307
00:17:42.293 --> 00:17:45.085
- I need everybody.
Let's do it again!

308
00:17:45.168 --> 00:17:47.877
- We like to use Circus
as social work.

309
00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:52.001
We've gotten more people in.
more ages. more families.

310
00:17:54.126 --> 00:17:55.877
We're truly
a community circus.

311
00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.543
We're here
to support each other

312
00:17:57.627 --> 00:17:59.835
and literally
lift each other up.

313
00:18:04.001 --> 00:18:05.502
- When I was a kid
in the '60s.

314
00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:08.752
Riverside. the city just down
the road from Redlands.

315
00:18:08.835 --> 00:18:12.585
wasn't the happening place
it is today.

316
00:18:12.669 --> 00:18:15.877
Riverside was just trying
to hold on as a citrus town

317
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.251
and was fading
as a resort town.

318
00:18:18.335 --> 00:18:21.251
- We've made an emphasis
on investing in downtown.

319
00:18:21.335 --> 00:18:23.126
The Mission Inn.
the Fox Theater.

320
00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:24.919
There was public money

321
00:18:25.001 --> 00:18:25.919
that was put into that.

322
00:18:26.001 --> 00:18:27.085
I think it was close

323
00:18:27.168 --> 00:18:28.085
to $100 million.

324
00:18:28.168 --> 00:18:30.460
Now seeing apartments.
restaurants.

325
00:18:30.543 --> 00:18:33.043
retail coming back
to downtown.

326
00:18:38.085 --> 00:18:39.585
- Riverside is making itself

327
00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:41.460
into a place people want
to live.

328
00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:44.460
A few miles away.

329
00:18:44.543 --> 00:18:46.960
San Bernardino is trying
to do the same thing.

330
00:18:54.043 --> 00:18:56.960
You have to start
with young people.

331
00:18:57.043 --> 00:18:59.126
They need to feel
their hometown

332
00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:01.627
will give them a chance.

333
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:03.960
- When you typically think
of a high-poverty community.

334
00:19:04.043 --> 00:19:06.919
you sometimes don't think
of high levels of success.

335
00:19:07.001 --> 00:19:11.794
Bridging college and career is
what this school is known for.

336
00:19:11.877 --> 00:19:13.502
- Kayley's proposing

337
00:19:13.585 --> 00:19:16.085
obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder.

338
00:19:16.168 --> 00:19:18.794
- They have. like. unwanted
thoughts that cause stress...

339
00:19:18.877 --> 00:19:20.794
- Cajon High School's
graduation rates

340
00:19:20.877 --> 00:19:23.293
were among the lowest
in the state.

341
00:19:23.377 --> 00:19:26.460
Now they're over 90%.

342
00:19:26.543 --> 00:19:29.001
They have
over 50 career pathways.

343
00:19:29.085 --> 00:19:32.627
like advanced robotics
and animatronics.

344
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:36.043
- And we know that the medical
field is always in need.

345
00:19:36.126 --> 00:19:39.210
so we have a very strong
medical assistance program.

346
00:19:39.293 --> 00:19:40.794
- Ready?
Go.

347
00:19:40.877 --> 00:19:43.460
One. two. three. four...

348
00:19:43.543 --> 00:19:44.877
- The students
in dark-blue scrubs

349
00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.168
love to teach what they know.

350
00:19:46.251 --> 00:19:48.210
They're proud of the skills
that they've learned.

351
00:19:48.293 --> 00:19:50.377
- We're gonna start here.

352
00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:51.543
- They can definitely
start working

353
00:19:51.627 --> 00:19:53.669
right out of high school
if they choose to.

354
00:19:53.752 --> 00:19:55.710
A lot of them who have gone
into the military.

355
00:19:55.794 --> 00:19:57.502
now registered nurses.

356
00:19:57.585 --> 00:19:59.126
A lot of them will go
to college.

357
00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:01.627
And I know as soon as they go
on their internships.

358
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:02.877
all the lights
are gonna go on.

359
00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.126
and they're gonna really find

360
00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:05.502
that perfect position
for them.

361
00:20:05.585 --> 00:20:07.418
what they really want to do.

362
00:20:07.502 --> 00:20:10.460
- Tonight
the prosecution is confident

363
00:20:10.543 --> 00:20:12.710
that we will prove
beyond a reasonable doubt

364
00:20:12.794 --> 00:20:15.752
that the defendant is guilty.
Your Honor.

365
00:20:15.835 --> 00:20:17.377
- Over 40 years ago.

366
00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:20.001
San Bernardino was named
an All-America City.

367
00:20:20.085 --> 00:20:22.752
- I will be portraying
Sam Colostian.

368
00:20:22.835 --> 00:20:23.752
- Publish...

369
00:20:23.835 --> 00:20:26.043
- They were recognized
for innovation

370
00:20:26.126 --> 00:20:29.001
and their strong sense
of community.

371
00:20:29.085 --> 00:20:30.377
- I'll be representing
the people

372
00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:31.919
of the state of California.

373
00:20:32.001 --> 00:20:34.669
- Cajon High School
gives you hope

374
00:20:34.752 --> 00:20:36.835
for San Bernardino's future.

375
00:20:43.001 --> 00:20:46.543
- Most people's lives follow
the same basic arc.

376
00:20:46.627 --> 00:20:50.752
You're born. you grow up.
grow old.

377
00:20:50.835 --> 00:20:52.960
and. finally. you die.

378
00:20:53.043 --> 00:20:56.752
Some towns can have
a similar fate.

379
00:20:56.835 --> 00:21:00.001
A town left behind
by economic change

380
00:21:00.085 --> 00:21:02.210
may just die off.

381
00:21:04.168 --> 00:21:07.960
But sometimes a town
whose life was in the past

382
00:21:08.043 --> 00:21:09.919
becomes reborn.

383
00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.460
My view of American history

384
00:21:17.543 --> 00:21:20.043
is the country's always been
in trouble.

385
00:21:20.126 --> 00:21:22.585
and the story of any given
moment in American history

386
00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:25.794
is how the in-trouble quotient
is balancing out

387
00:21:25.877 --> 00:21:28.293
with the responding-
to-trouble-quotient.

388
00:21:28.377 --> 00:21:29.919
I'm always asking people.

389
00:21:30.001 --> 00:21:32.251
"In the long graph
of this city's history.

390
00:21:32.335 --> 00:21:34.085
"of your history. where are we?

391
00:21:34.168 --> 00:21:36.752
Is it an upslope
or a downslope?"

392
00:21:36.835 --> 00:21:38.585
- I think we look at things
really differently.

393
00:21:38.669 --> 00:21:40.168
Jim is the historian.

394
00:21:40.251 --> 00:21:41.627
I'm listening on the sidewalk

395
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:43.960
of what's going on
at this moment.

396
00:21:44.043 --> 00:21:47.293
I find that the best parts
of getting a sense of the town

397
00:21:47.377 --> 00:21:49.001
are in the public spaces.

398
00:21:49.085 --> 00:21:51.543
The kind of small bits.

399
00:21:51.627 --> 00:21:53.460
how people relate
to each other.

400
00:21:53.543 --> 00:21:56.627
to me. are really important.

401
00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:58.293
- Five years ago.
a little more than that.

402
00:21:58.377 --> 00:21:59.794
I put an item
on "The Atlantic" site.

403
00:21:59.877 --> 00:22:03.585
saying. "Tell us the story
of your town

404
00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:05.126
and why we should go there."

405
00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:06.794
And the qualifications were.

406
00:22:06.877 --> 00:22:09.669
first. that it should be
a small-er place.

407
00:22:09.752 --> 00:22:12.293
in the sense that the media
only went there

408
00:22:12.377 --> 00:22:13.835
when there was a problem.

409
00:22:13.919 --> 00:22:15.960
You know.
when there was a shooting.

410
00:22:16.043 --> 00:22:18.502
when there was
a public-health problem.

411
00:22:18.585 --> 00:22:21.377
But there wasn't the sort
of three-dimensional portrayal

412
00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.168
of it as a real place.

413
00:22:23.251 --> 00:22:24.794
When we showed up
in these towns

414
00:22:24.877 --> 00:22:26.168
over the last five years.

415
00:22:26.251 --> 00:22:27.710
they had no idea
we were coming.

416
00:22:27.794 --> 00:22:28.835
They weren't putting on

417
00:22:28.919 --> 00:22:30.543
some big chamber of commerce
presentation.

418
00:22:30.627 --> 00:22:32.001
We just showed up and said.

419
00:22:32.085 --> 00:22:33.502
"We'd like to know the story
of your town."

420
00:22:33.585 --> 00:22:36.377
And so we were catching people
sort of unawares.

421
00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:39.126
- Another thing about getting
a sense of the town--

422
00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:41.960
this comes from our living
in Japan. actually.

423
00:22:42.043 --> 00:22:45.669
There are two words in
Japanese. tatemae and honne.

424
00:22:45.752 --> 00:22:48.960
And tatemae is when

425
00:22:49.043 --> 00:22:51.794
people say what they think
that you want to hear

426
00:22:51.877 --> 00:22:53.251
in a very nice way.

427
00:22:53.335 --> 00:22:56.502
And then there's the honne.
which is what they really mean.

428
00:22:56.585 --> 00:22:59.335
Going into any place
that you don't understand.

429
00:22:59.418 --> 00:23:01.335
the tatemae comes first.

430
00:23:01.418 --> 00:23:03.835
but then people
can't help themselves.

431
00:23:03.919 --> 00:23:07.919
You finally get what
the honne is after a while.

432
00:23:24.418 --> 00:23:29.669
- Every 99 minutes.
a satellite scans the Earth...

433
00:23:29.752 --> 00:23:32.585
gathering imagery and data
about the planet.

434
00:23:37.126 --> 00:23:41.460
Those pictures are beamed down
to EROS.

435
00:23:41.543 --> 00:23:44.710
a government facility outside
of Sioux Falls. South Dakota.

436
00:23:58.293 --> 00:24:01.085
EROS holds
the world's largest collection

437
00:24:01.168 --> 00:24:03.210
of images
of the Earth's surface.

438
00:24:05.502 --> 00:24:06.960
- Two miles south.

439
00:24:07.043 --> 00:24:10.460
Raven Industries is also
gathering data from above.

440
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:19.085
Raven makes balloons
for everything

441
00:24:19.168 --> 00:24:23.293
from the military
to Macy's parade.

442
00:24:23.377 --> 00:24:25.919
- Three. two. one. release.

443
00:24:37.877 --> 00:24:39.669
- You wouldn't think
in a farming community.

444
00:24:39.752 --> 00:24:42.460
they would have
high technology and aerospace.

445
00:24:42.543 --> 00:24:44.210
It's a really key aspect

446
00:24:44.293 --> 00:24:46.835
of why it's great
to live here.

447
00:24:46.919 --> 00:24:48.919
Whenever we bring people
to Sioux Falls.

448
00:24:49.001 --> 00:24:51.126
we bring 'em downtown.
and they really are surprised

449
00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:55.460
to see that here in
a small town in South Dakota

450
00:24:55.543 --> 00:24:57.043
that there's really so much
going on.

451
00:24:57.126 --> 00:25:00.335
There's a lot of life.
a lot of activities.

452
00:25:00.418 --> 00:25:01.960
- It's got the best
of both worlds.

453
00:25:02.043 --> 00:25:03.460
Small enough
you don't have traffic.

454
00:25:03.543 --> 00:25:05.168
you don't have a commute
to worry about.

455
00:25:05.251 --> 00:25:06.835
It's big enough
that got a symphony.

456
00:25:06.919 --> 00:25:08.043
we got plays coming through.

457
00:25:08.126 --> 00:25:09.669
- There are opportunities
for jobs.

458
00:25:09.752 --> 00:25:11.210
You got great bars
and restaurants.

459
00:25:11.293 --> 00:25:13.543
Since six years ago.
we went from one brewery--

460
00:25:13.627 --> 00:25:16.335
we're now gonna have 14
by the end of the year.

461
00:25:16.418 --> 00:25:19.835
- People want to be downtown.

462
00:25:19.919 --> 00:25:22.502
They want to live down here.
they want to shop down here.

463
00:25:22.585 --> 00:25:25.460
And it wasn't that way
even ten years ago.

464
00:25:31.251 --> 00:25:34.627
- In the 1980s. Sioux Falls
had a wave of growth

465
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:39.168
when South Dakota changed
its laws on credit cards.

466
00:25:39.251 --> 00:25:42.335
Suddenly. by moving their
headquarters to South Dakota.

467
00:25:42.418 --> 00:25:46.210
banks could charge customers
much higher interest rates.

468
00:25:46.293 --> 00:25:47.877
which meant big profits

469
00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.585
from people who don't pay off
their credit card each month.

470
00:25:51.669 --> 00:25:54.669
Companies like Citibank
and Wells Fargo moved here.

471
00:25:54.752 --> 00:25:57.085
creating thousands of jobs.

472
00:26:03.335 --> 00:26:07.085
In Sioux Falls.
right by the iconic falls.

473
00:26:07.168 --> 00:26:08.710
is the meatpacking plant.

474
00:26:08.794 --> 00:26:12.835
where around 18.000 hogs a day
are slaughtered.

475
00:26:12.919 --> 00:26:16.960
When the pandemic hit.
this was a COVID hotspot.

476
00:26:18.585 --> 00:26:21.043
The jobs are
physically demanding

477
00:26:21.126 --> 00:26:22.543
and are often done
by immigrants

478
00:26:22.627 --> 00:26:24.126
with limited English.

479
00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:28.460
- Sioux Falls
has long relied on refugees

480
00:26:28.543 --> 00:26:31.251
and immigrants as workers.

481
00:26:31.335 --> 00:26:32.585
Lutheran Social Services

482
00:26:32.669 --> 00:26:35.710
is the agency
that helps settle them.

483
00:26:35.794 --> 00:26:37.919
- We're kind of
the one-stop shop

484
00:26:38.001 --> 00:26:41.377
for all services for refugees
in South Dakota.

485
00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:43.919
We provide welcome on arrival.

486
00:26:44.001 --> 00:26:48.710
but we also do housing
and job placement

487
00:26:48.794 --> 00:26:52.585
and English language classes
and citizenship.

488
00:26:52.669 --> 00:26:54.126
- Technology--

489
00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:56.418
that was a new word
last week maybe.

490
00:26:56.502 --> 00:26:57.752
Technology.

491
00:26:57.835 --> 00:26:59.418
- Tablet.
- Tablet.

492
00:26:59.502 --> 00:27:01.585
- Uh-huh.
- Cell phone.

493
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:04.418
- Okay. tablet. cell phone.
smartphone.

494
00:27:04.502 --> 00:27:05.627
What else?

495
00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:08.168
- Keyboard.
- Keyboard.

496
00:27:09.877 --> 00:27:11.752
- The majority
of our full-time staff.

497
00:27:11.835 --> 00:27:13.794
they're former refugees
themselves.

498
00:27:13.877 --> 00:27:15.543
- I'm a medical specialist.

499
00:27:15.627 --> 00:27:16.794
I help take clients

500
00:27:16.877 --> 00:27:18.126
to their doctors' appointment

501
00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:19.460
upon their arrival.

502
00:27:19.543 --> 00:27:20.627
- I came as a refugee.

503
00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:23.085
Lived here five years
and then became a citizen.

504
00:27:23.168 --> 00:27:25.126
My "childrens" are citizen.

505
00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:26.919
I'm very happy to live
in Sioux Falls

506
00:27:27.001 --> 00:27:30.627
because this is a very
nice place to raise family.

507
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:31.960
- As you drive around.

508
00:27:32.043 --> 00:27:34.585
you'll see great diversity
in our small businesses.

509
00:27:34.669 --> 00:27:36.460
People that move in
to this community

510
00:27:36.543 --> 00:27:38.794
that start barbershops
or hair salons.

511
00:27:38.877 --> 00:27:42.543
grocery stores. restaurants.

512
00:27:42.627 --> 00:27:46.293
- I'm a refugee. I'm a Black.

513
00:27:46.377 --> 00:27:51.043
I'm originally from Somalia.
and I'm also Muslim.

514
00:27:51.126 --> 00:27:56.502
so which means I'm
a combination of four elements.

515
00:27:56.585 --> 00:27:58.335
I'm not a threat.

516
00:27:58.418 --> 00:28:00.335
- My gosh.
think of what they've overcome.

517
00:28:00.418 --> 00:28:03.126
especially refugees.
to get here.

518
00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:04.960
I don't know what we would be

519
00:28:05.043 --> 00:28:09.335
if we didn't have refugees
and immigrants in our country.

520
00:28:09.418 --> 00:28:11.126
- I wouldn't be here. for one.

521
00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:14.293
- 99% of the people living
in America

522
00:28:14.377 --> 00:28:16.460
are either immigrants
or refugees.

523
00:28:16.543 --> 00:28:19.710
The reason why America
is a great country now--

524
00:28:19.794 --> 00:28:24.710
it's because of people like me
and you and everyone.

525
00:29:00.669 --> 00:29:02.335
- When I say Sioux Falls.
South Dakota.

526
00:29:02.418 --> 00:29:04.085
people think
of Mount Rushmore.

527
00:29:04.168 --> 00:29:05.877
We are on the map
because of public art.

528
00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.043
because somebody carved
these four faces

529
00:29:08.126 --> 00:29:09.877
into the side of a mountain.

530
00:29:15.377 --> 00:29:18.919
- Most of my art comes from
just observation of nature

531
00:29:19.001 --> 00:29:23.418
and the "Arc of Dreams"
is a good example of that.

532
00:29:23.502 --> 00:29:26.251
In terms of the narrative
of the "Arc of Dreams."

533
00:29:26.335 --> 00:29:28.585
the idea is that
we have dreams

534
00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:30.752
that originate somewhere
in our consciousness

535
00:29:30.835 --> 00:29:33.710
and we can take 'em a certain
distance. but at some point.

536
00:29:33.794 --> 00:29:36.835
we have to trust ourselves
and the future.

537
00:29:36.919 --> 00:29:38.752
The synapse
between the two arcs

538
00:29:38.835 --> 00:29:41.293
represents that leap of faith.

539
00:29:44.335 --> 00:29:46.752
- Public art--it's
a significant component here

540
00:29:46.835 --> 00:29:47.960
in terms
of the quality of life.

541
00:29:48.043 --> 00:29:50.085
why people stay
and don't move away.

542
00:29:50.168 --> 00:29:51.919
And if they do move away
at a young age.

543
00:29:52.001 --> 00:29:53.085
they almost always come back

544
00:29:53.168 --> 00:29:54.960
because of the quality
of life.

545
00:30:07.627 --> 00:30:09.418
- Good evening.
I'm Angela Kennecke.

546
00:30:09.502 --> 00:30:10.460
Tonight...

547
00:30:10.543 --> 00:30:12.627
- Angela Kennecke
is a well-known reporter

548
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:14.168
in our market.

549
00:30:14.251 --> 00:30:17.919
Her daughter died
from a fentanyl overdose

550
00:30:18.001 --> 00:30:19.960
a little over
a year and a half ago now.

551
00:30:20.043 --> 00:30:22.960
And her daughter was actually
our family's nanny

552
00:30:23.043 --> 00:30:26.794
for a couple years. and she was
a very special gal to us.

553
00:30:26.877 --> 00:30:30.960
And that really hit us hard
when that happened.

554
00:30:31.043 --> 00:30:33.835
- Nobody thinks this is going
to happen to them.

555
00:30:33.919 --> 00:30:36.418
I knew there was a problem
with my daughter.

556
00:30:36.502 --> 00:30:39.627
I didn't know
she was using heroin.

557
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:41.960
She didn't want me to know
what she was doing

558
00:30:42.043 --> 00:30:44.377
because she was ashamed of it.

559
00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:47.710
Emily was just a brilliant kid.

560
00:30:47.794 --> 00:30:51.001
She was a gifted artist.

561
00:30:51.085 --> 00:30:53.126
- By sharing our story.
you know.

562
00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:55.085
we can help some people out.

563
00:30:55.168 --> 00:30:58.168
- If fentanyl hadn't been
in my daughter's heroin.

564
00:30:58.251 --> 00:31:00.502
she would still be alive.

565
00:31:00.585 --> 00:31:03.293
- Angela. using her platform
as a reporter.

566
00:31:03.377 --> 00:31:04.794
has really done a good job

567
00:31:04.877 --> 00:31:06.960
of trying to create
an awareness in our community

568
00:31:07.043 --> 00:31:09.043
of what the opioid challenges

569
00:31:09.126 --> 00:31:10.794
that we face
in Sioux Falls are.

570
00:31:10.877 --> 00:31:12.627
I think we're very good
at hiding those things

571
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:14.669
and not talking
about the problems.

572
00:31:14.752 --> 00:31:17.377
- We need to replace judgment
with compassion.

573
00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:19.919
and we need to replace
punishment with treatment.

574
00:31:20.001 --> 00:31:22.210
- Angela's sharing
what she went through

575
00:31:22.293 --> 00:31:23.627
with her daughter.

576
00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:25.543
talking
about the opioid epidemic

577
00:31:25.627 --> 00:31:28.085
in the context of an illness.

578
00:31:28.168 --> 00:31:31.543
I think it's had a tremendous
impact far beyond Sioux Falls.

579
00:31:31.627 --> 00:31:33.377
probably far beyond
South Dakota.

580
00:31:48.585 --> 00:31:50.251
- South Dakota's
biggest industry

581
00:31:50.335 --> 00:31:53.543
has always been agriculture...

582
00:31:53.627 --> 00:31:56.418
but it's done by fewer
and fewer farmers.

583
00:31:58.293 --> 00:32:01.543
So the little towns
that support farm families

584
00:32:01.627 --> 00:32:02.835
often wither.

585
00:32:10.502 --> 00:32:13.251
- My dad has a number
of little quips.

586
00:32:13.335 --> 00:32:14.251
One of his sayings is.

587
00:32:14.335 --> 00:32:15.460
"Farming is a great way
of life

588
00:32:15.543 --> 00:32:17.126
as long as you don't have
to make a living at it."

589
00:32:21.293 --> 00:32:22.877
I've wanted to farm
my whole life.

590
00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.960
That's all I ever wanted
to do.

591
00:32:27.168 --> 00:32:29.919
My dad told me and had
the foresight to know

592
00:32:30.001 --> 00:32:32.251
that our farm is fairly close
to Sioux Falls

593
00:32:32.335 --> 00:32:34.377
and may or may not be here
in the future.

594
00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:36.210
It will likely be developed
at some point in time.

595
00:32:36.293 --> 00:32:39.752
He said I had to get
a real job.

596
00:32:39.835 --> 00:32:43.085
- Karl Oehlke's real job
when he's not farming

597
00:32:43.168 --> 00:32:46.085
is as a physician's assistant
at a Avera Health.

598
00:32:46.168 --> 00:32:49.627
Knowing the stress farmers
are constantly under.

599
00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:54.001
whether from flooded fields
or low commodity prices.

600
00:32:54.085 --> 00:32:58.669
Karl helped create
the Farmer's Stress Hotline.

601
00:32:58.752 --> 00:33:00.794
- It's 24 hours a day.
It's confidential.

602
00:33:00.877 --> 00:33:02.418
Talking to me on the phone.

603
00:33:02.502 --> 00:33:04.460
I can empathize with them
and explain to them.

604
00:33:04.543 --> 00:33:06.919
"Yeah. I know exactly
what you're going through."

605
00:33:07.001 --> 00:33:09.126
The biggest thing
we're dealing with right now--

606
00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:11.293
fear. anxiety.

607
00:33:11.377 --> 00:33:12.919
"I'm working extremely hard.

608
00:33:13.001 --> 00:33:14.418
"yet I have nothing to show
for it.

609
00:33:14.502 --> 00:33:17.502
How can I keep my kids
in shoes?"

610
00:33:17.585 --> 00:33:18.752
Trying to prevent suicide.

611
00:33:18.835 --> 00:33:20.418
is. of course.
our biggest concern.

612
00:33:22.251 --> 00:33:26.377
Prototypical farmer was always
the stereotype of a very stoic.

613
00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:28.460
hardened person. you know?

614
00:33:28.543 --> 00:33:30.001
And to let their guard down

615
00:33:30.085 --> 00:33:31.835
is not something
that they're used to doing.

616
00:33:35.585 --> 00:33:38.043
I've heard so many farmers
say to me

617
00:33:38.126 --> 00:33:39.460
even by the end
of the interview

618
00:33:39.543 --> 00:33:42.502
and maybe I haven't even
offered them a medication.

619
00:33:42.585 --> 00:33:44.335
they just felt better talking.

620
00:33:44.418 --> 00:33:48.210
It's just like this sense
of calm comes over them.

621
00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:16.543
- Our history is shaped
by migration and conflict.

622
00:34:18.585 --> 00:34:22.210
In the 19th century.
European immigrants moved west

623
00:34:22.293 --> 00:34:24.377
into the homelands
of the Dakota Sioux

624
00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:27.543
in the central U.S.
and Canada.

625
00:34:27.627 --> 00:34:29.752
After a series
of broken treaties.

626
00:34:29.835 --> 00:34:31.752
wars. and public hangings.

627
00:34:31.835 --> 00:34:34.710
the Dakota were driven out
by the U.S. government

628
00:34:34.794 --> 00:34:37.752
and scattered
to small reservations.

629
00:34:37.835 --> 00:34:39.877
The Flandreau Santee Sioux

630
00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:42.752
settled on land
near Sioux Falls.

631
00:34:46.794 --> 00:34:48.752
- Where we're located here
in Flandreau.

632
00:34:48.835 --> 00:34:50.377
we were two to three hours

633
00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:53.251
from all other
Dakota communities.

634
00:34:53.335 --> 00:34:55.418
so we all stay in touch.

635
00:34:55.502 --> 00:34:57.293
- Anywhere we go.
we're Dakota.

636
00:34:57.377 --> 00:35:00.085
Don't matter if we're in DC
or we're in China

637
00:35:00.168 --> 00:35:01.585
or we're here in the homelands.

638
00:35:01.669 --> 00:35:04.126
We'll be Dakota.

639
00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:06.251
- How many here?
300 and some here on rez?

640
00:35:06.335 --> 00:35:08.251
- Yeah.
Close to it. yeah.

641
00:35:08.335 --> 00:35:12.460
- And total. 500. 600?
- About 600. 700.

642
00:35:12.543 --> 00:35:14.585
- There was a thing called
Indian Court of Offenses

643
00:35:14.669 --> 00:35:16.251
back in the day.

644
00:35:16.335 --> 00:35:19.251
We weren't even allowed
to gather like this.

645
00:35:19.335 --> 00:35:20.919
"Kill the Indian.
save the man."

646
00:35:21.001 --> 00:35:22.960
The boarding-school era.

647
00:35:23.043 --> 00:35:25.960
Started cutting our hair.
putting us in little suits.

648
00:35:26.043 --> 00:35:27.960
putting us in boarding schools.

649
00:35:28.043 --> 00:35:31.919
To speak to culture.
the language.

650
00:35:32.001 --> 00:35:33.835
you were punished.

651
00:35:33.919 --> 00:35:36.669
And then the freedom
of religion was. like. in 1978.

652
00:35:36.752 --> 00:35:38.001
That's not that long ago.

653
00:35:38.085 --> 00:35:40.627
So his grandpa. my dad.

654
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:43.794
they were both fluent speakers.
but...

655
00:35:43.877 --> 00:35:46.168
sometimes it was hard
for them to speak

656
00:35:46.251 --> 00:35:47.877
just because of that era.

657
00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:49.752
- My older relatives.
grandparents and whatnot.

658
00:35:49.835 --> 00:35:53.502
they were forced off the
reservation to find employment.

659
00:35:53.585 --> 00:35:55.835
to make better lives.
if you will.

660
00:35:55.919 --> 00:35:57.835
in the eyes of
the United States government.

661
00:35:57.919 --> 00:36:00.960
- Growing up in Minneapolis.

662
00:36:01.043 --> 00:36:04.085
we just knew we were Indian.

663
00:36:04.168 --> 00:36:06.835
We knew that we went
to the little Indian programs.

664
00:36:06.919 --> 00:36:09.669
and that was about it.

665
00:36:09.752 --> 00:36:14.001
I had no idea of the history
that I was born in

666
00:36:14.085 --> 00:36:15.126
from the land.

667
00:36:19.585 --> 00:36:21.960
- The Royal River Casino
opened in 1990.

668
00:36:22.043 --> 00:36:24.001
The tribe runs it.

669
00:36:24.085 --> 00:36:25.877
At that time.
we were the only show in town.

670
00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.126
- Awesome.
- All right.

671
00:36:29.251 --> 00:36:32.126
- The casino itself
is a huge economic engine.

672
00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:34.669
not only for Flandreau.
but the surrounding areas.

673
00:36:34.752 --> 00:36:38.335
The impact.
it multiplies everywhere else.

674
00:36:38.418 --> 00:36:40.001
- Brought a lot
of the economy back.

675
00:36:40.085 --> 00:36:42.293
and it brought a lot
of people back. too.

676
00:36:42.377 --> 00:36:43.835
- Come on. come on.

677
00:36:43.919 --> 00:36:46.168
- And it provides
for social programs.

678
00:36:46.251 --> 00:36:47.669
everything
that the tribe needs--

679
00:36:47.752 --> 00:36:49.001
government services.

680
00:36:49.085 --> 00:36:51.001
You can say it helped
springboard us

681
00:36:51.085 --> 00:36:53.210
into the revitalization
of the language program.

682
00:36:53.293 --> 00:36:56.126
- How many people speak Dakota?

683
00:36:56.210 --> 00:37:00.377
- Well. I can speak
for just this community.

684
00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:02.043
Maybe three.

685
00:37:02.126 --> 00:37:04.585
The tribe here made the effort

686
00:37:04.669 --> 00:37:08.085
to push for
a language-immersion class.

687
00:37:09.919 --> 00:37:12.543
Who are we
if we don't have our language?

688
00:37:44.335 --> 00:37:46.919
- Powwows--it's not just
for one tribe.

689
00:37:47.001 --> 00:37:48.710
It's many tribes.

690
00:37:48.794 --> 00:37:50.460
We may not all speak
the same language.

691
00:37:50.543 --> 00:37:52.251
but we all come together.

692
00:37:55.043 --> 00:37:59.085
I'm Santee Dakota.
Ho-Chunk and Meskwaki.

693
00:37:59.168 --> 00:38:00.418
As Native Americans.

694
00:38:00.502 --> 00:38:03.794
I think it's real important
to have that cultural identity

695
00:38:03.877 --> 00:38:07.418
for dancing and beadwork
and crafts and leatherwork.

696
00:38:07.502 --> 00:38:09.752
I tell my kids. I said.
"You guys have to learn this.

697
00:38:09.835 --> 00:38:12.794
because when I'm gone.
there's not gonna be anybody."

698
00:38:19.168 --> 00:38:21.585
A lot of Natives have never
been exposed to culture.

699
00:38:21.669 --> 00:38:23.001
you know. like this.

700
00:38:23.085 --> 00:38:24.919
And if we can get more people

701
00:38:25.001 --> 00:38:26.585
to be courageous
and get out there

702
00:38:26.669 --> 00:38:28.585
in the center
and dance with us...

703
00:38:28.669 --> 00:38:30.251
Just listen to the music.

704
00:38:30.335 --> 00:38:32.335
and you'll get the rhythm
and you'll go.

705
00:38:38.752 --> 00:38:41.960
- Last night at the Wacipi.
there's a little girl.

706
00:38:42.043 --> 00:38:43.794
and she looked at me.
and she said...

707
00:38:45.377 --> 00:38:46.585
That was saying hello.

708
00:38:46.669 --> 00:38:48.251
And then all the other little
girls around them

709
00:38:48.335 --> 00:38:50.627
were saying... .
"Hello. hello."

710
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:55.460
It gets emotional to just hear
them speak their language.

711
00:38:57.502 --> 00:39:00.543
- It's saving our life.
It's saving our kids.

712
00:39:00.627 --> 00:39:03.710
It's giving a chance.
a future...

713
00:39:03.794 --> 00:39:06.669
for us to continue.

714
00:39:27.126 --> 00:39:29.877
- The dark chapters
in American history

715
00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:32.335
are still unfolding
in life today.

716
00:39:35.752 --> 00:39:39.001
In our travels. we've been
struck by how differently

717
00:39:39.085 --> 00:39:41.418
different communities
approach their past...

718
00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:47.752
And which parts of it they
embrace and which they avoid.

719
00:39:49.794 --> 00:39:53.377
Columbus. Mississippi. is
on the geological Black Belt.

720
00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:56.919
a band of fertile soil
dating back millions of years.

721
00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:01.585
The soil made it a good place
for plantations.

722
00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:10.835
In Columbus. antebellum
mansions are reminders

723
00:40:10.919 --> 00:40:12.919
of life
during the Confederacy.

724
00:40:17.126 --> 00:40:21.085
The markers in
Friendship Cemetery are. too.

725
00:40:26.835 --> 00:40:28.418
After slavery ended.

726
00:40:28.502 --> 00:40:30.752
Jim Crow laws
and civil rights abuses

727
00:40:30.835 --> 00:40:33.377
into the 20th century
and beyond

728
00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:36.919
are things to be reckoned with
across the country.

729
00:40:46.001 --> 00:40:49.877
Sandfield is Columbus'
historic Black cemetery.

730
00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:54.085
- Today we are so elated
to stand here and tell you

731
00:40:54.168 --> 00:40:57.752
that we have a marker
for Sandfield Cemetery.

732
00:40:57.835 --> 00:41:01.126
Established before
the Civil War.

733
00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:03.794
among people buried here
are Robert Gleed.

734
00:41:03.877 --> 00:41:07.460
a former slave who served
in the state senate.

735
00:41:07.543 --> 00:41:12.168
Reflect back. lest we forget
our history and our heritage.

736
00:41:12.251 --> 00:41:16.418
all:

737
00:41:27.085 --> 00:41:30.502
- We're here today because
on the 8th of May in 1865.

738
00:41:30.585 --> 00:41:32.293
Union troops arrived
in Columbus.

739
00:41:32.377 --> 00:41:35.502
That is effectively
when enslavement ended.

740
00:41:35.585 --> 00:41:37.293
- Chuck Yarborough teaches

741
00:41:37.377 --> 00:41:40.502
at the Mississippi School
for Mathematics & Science.

742
00:41:40.585 --> 00:41:42.627
It's a public high school.
and every year

743
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:46.543
they explore the town's
history at the public library.

744
00:41:46.627 --> 00:41:49.502
- He says in the diary.

745
00:41:49.585 --> 00:41:51.502
Dr. Wilson received
a threatening letter

746
00:41:51.585 --> 00:41:53.043
to the school today.

747
00:41:53.126 --> 00:41:55.001
- "If you don't leave.
we will hang you."

748
00:41:55.085 --> 00:41:56.043
- We gonna get the rope

749
00:41:56.126 --> 00:41:57.502
and then we're gonna hang you
with the rope.

750
00:41:57.585 --> 00:41:58.502
- Yeah.
- Like...

751
00:41:58.585 --> 00:42:00.210
- There's some specificity
to that

752
00:42:00.293 --> 00:42:03.168
that's even more
ominous feeling. right? Okay.

753
00:42:03.251 --> 00:42:04.669
- So the first thing
that you'll notice that--

754
00:42:04.752 --> 00:42:05.919
- In the archives.

755
00:42:06.001 --> 00:42:09.669
students learn about life
in Columbus 150 years ago.

756
00:42:09.752 --> 00:42:11.377
- But even right here.

757
00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:15.168
you can find
"one Negro woman named Milly."

758
00:42:15.251 --> 00:42:16.669
- Finding the Milly
that was associated

759
00:42:16.752 --> 00:42:19.001
with this court case
is a whole nother thing.

760
00:42:19.085 --> 00:42:21.960
- Then they write scripts
to perform in the cemetery

761
00:42:22.043 --> 00:42:23.627
on Emancipation Day.

762
00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:27.669
- Good afternoon.
good people of Columbus.

763
00:42:27.752 --> 00:42:29.543
although my experience ought
to have taught me

764
00:42:29.627 --> 00:42:32.877
that the people of Columbus
aren't always so good.

765
00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:35.377
- The next document
we're going to look at--

766
00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:39.377
page one and two
of the newspapers.

767
00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:41.085
It says.
"Columbus. Mississippi.

768
00:42:41.168 --> 00:42:43.543
November 3. 1875."

769
00:42:43.627 --> 00:42:45.168
- "Under these instructions.

770
00:42:45.251 --> 00:42:47.418
"a number of Negroes
were arrested

771
00:42:47.502 --> 00:42:50.251
"and turned over
to the proper police officers.

772
00:42:50.335 --> 00:42:53.085
"I regret to state
that the following Negroes

773
00:42:53.168 --> 00:42:54.543
were shot and killed."

774
00:42:54.627 --> 00:42:56.919
- And as we move
through downtown.

775
00:42:57.001 --> 00:43:00.043
a mob led
by Jacob Hunter Sharp

776
00:43:00.126 --> 00:43:01.710
attacked us.

777
00:43:01.794 --> 00:43:03.543
They shot into our group.

778
00:43:03.627 --> 00:43:07.502
killing four innocent Black men
and wounding three others.

779
00:43:07.585 --> 00:43:09.710
- Makes them way more brave
in my eyes

780
00:43:09.794 --> 00:43:12.418
because. like.
they're actively. like.

781
00:43:12.502 --> 00:43:13.418
threatening to kill them

782
00:43:13.502 --> 00:43:15.210
and telling them
how they're gonna do it.

783
00:43:15.293 --> 00:43:17.752
- The ex-Confederates didn't
stop with the rumor. though.

784
00:43:17.835 --> 00:43:19.877
We received a letter
threatening death

785
00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:22.418
if we continued to educate
the freed people.

786
00:43:22.502 --> 00:43:23.543
- I think this actually shows

787
00:43:23.627 --> 00:43:25.043
that the people
who threatened them

788
00:43:25.126 --> 00:43:28.251
understood the importance
of education

789
00:43:28.335 --> 00:43:29.710
and how it could
be problematic

790
00:43:29.794 --> 00:43:31.585
if people knew
how to read and how to write.

791
00:43:31.669 --> 00:43:33.293
Taking away the education

792
00:43:33.377 --> 00:43:35.418
keeps the community
in a submissive position.

793
00:43:35.502 --> 00:43:37.585
and they would do that
by any means necessary.

794
00:43:37.669 --> 00:43:39.585
- I feel like my story

795
00:43:39.669 --> 00:43:41.794
is just the ultimate
American success story.

796
00:43:41.877 --> 00:43:45.752
I am the son of a man
and a woman who were enslaved.

797
00:43:45.835 --> 00:43:48.877
But my father bought his
freedom before the Civil War.

798
00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:51.126
- Some of you
mistakenly believe

799
00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:54.168
that only men helped establish
this community.

800
00:43:54.251 --> 00:43:57.627
but let me let y'all in
on a little secret.

801
00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:59.919
Behind every strong man.

802
00:44:00.001 --> 00:44:02.919
there is an equally
if not stronger woman.

803
00:44:05.377 --> 00:44:08.126
- I'm Mississippi State Senator
Robert Gleed.

804
00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:09.835
a notable business owner
and political leader

805
00:44:09.919 --> 00:44:11.794
in Columbus and Lowndes County.

806
00:44:11.877 --> 00:44:13.627
Now. I used to tell
my children.

807
00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:16.960
"We all stand on the shoulders
of someone who came before us."

808
00:44:17.043 --> 00:44:18.794
We had our setbacks
as a country

809
00:44:18.877 --> 00:44:20.335
and as a people in our day.

810
00:44:20.418 --> 00:44:23.752
but it's clear
that progress has been made.

811
00:44:23.835 --> 00:44:26.460
And I like to think
that you folks can reach higher

812
00:44:26.543 --> 00:44:28.293
even when times are tough.

813
00:44:28.377 --> 00:44:29.669
'cause those many years ago.

814
00:44:29.752 --> 00:44:33.085
I offered my shoulders
for you to stand on.

815
00:44:33.168 --> 00:44:36.210
and I hope you'll do the same
for those that follow you.

816
00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:51.168
- When I moved here
from New York.

817
00:44:51.251 --> 00:44:54.043
I experienced a little racism.

818
00:44:54.126 --> 00:44:57.001
You know.
I was managing this hotel.

819
00:44:57.085 --> 00:44:59.502
and some guests
did not understand

820
00:44:59.585 --> 00:45:03.251
that I was the manager.
that it wasn't anyone above me.

821
00:45:03.335 --> 00:45:04.960
But as the town began to grow

822
00:45:05.043 --> 00:45:07.293
and I began to meet
more people.

823
00:45:07.377 --> 00:45:11.669
there's more of an acceptance
of African American people

824
00:45:11.752 --> 00:45:13.210
getting
in leadership position.

825
00:45:13.293 --> 00:45:14.710
management position.

826
00:45:14.794 --> 00:45:19.543
It takes some getting used to.
and it's not all of the South.

827
00:45:19.627 --> 00:45:24.043
The younger generation is
very accepting of diversity.

828
00:45:24.126 --> 00:45:26.877
They are making that change.

829
00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:28.210
The past is the past.

830
00:45:28.293 --> 00:45:31.543
and Mississippi is striving
for change.

831
00:45:48.752 --> 00:45:50.877
- Factories around Columbus
used to make things

832
00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:55.335
like blue jeans. hot dogs.
pork chops. and toilet seats.

833
00:45:55.418 --> 00:46:00.126
Those industries disappeared.
leaving 20% unemployment

834
00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:03.085
in the poorest state
in the country.

835
00:46:03.168 --> 00:46:05.418
Getting out of that kind
of depression

836
00:46:05.502 --> 00:46:06.877
doesn't just happen.

837
00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:08.502
It takes community action.

838
00:46:10.669 --> 00:46:11.794
The region around Columbus

839
00:46:11.877 --> 00:46:14.585
started a development agency
called LINK

840
00:46:14.669 --> 00:46:17.752
that's brought in lots
of high-tech manufacturers.

841
00:46:17.835 --> 00:46:20.794
- If it can be done here.
it can be done anywhere.

842
00:46:20.877 --> 00:46:22.877
- Convincing companies
to move here

843
00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:26.043
is the job of Joe Max Higgins
and Brenda Latham.

844
00:46:26.126 --> 00:46:28.043
- And we've built
a new industrial park

845
00:46:28.126 --> 00:46:29.585
and are in the process

846
00:46:29.669 --> 00:46:32.210
of doing a new industrial park
in Starkville.

847
00:46:32.293 --> 00:46:35.085
- We found a niche
in advanced manufacturing.

848
00:46:35.168 --> 00:46:37.585
We acquire property.
We install infrastructure.

849
00:46:37.669 --> 00:46:38.752
We locate companies.

850
00:46:38.835 --> 00:46:40.460
And if it all works out well.

851
00:46:40.543 --> 00:46:43.001
we get that company in. and
we get 'em going and running.

852
00:46:43.085 --> 00:46:45.126
Then we go and we do
another one and another one.

853
00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:46.835
But first thing we got to do
a lot of times

854
00:46:46.919 --> 00:46:50.835
is just put aside issues
or concerns or beliefs

855
00:46:50.919 --> 00:46:52.627
that may not be true.

856
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:54.627
You know. people tell us
we're last in everything good.

857
00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:57.293
- Well. I mean.
that's the rap we have.

858
00:46:57.377 --> 00:47:00.460
whether it's true or not--
we're last in everything good.

859
00:47:00.543 --> 00:47:03.251
- Mississippi was
the last state to still have

860
00:47:03.335 --> 00:47:06.669
the Confederate stars and bars
on its state flag.

861
00:47:09.543 --> 00:47:12.502
- Columbus has a foot
in antebellum

862
00:47:12.585 --> 00:47:13.960
and a foot in the future.

863
00:47:14.043 --> 00:47:16.543
Some days
they almost feel confused.

864
00:47:16.627 --> 00:47:18.293
And when I got here. I said.

865
00:47:18.377 --> 00:47:20.502
"Before I take this job.
answer a question for me.

866
00:47:20.585 --> 00:47:21.835
"Are you a community

867
00:47:21.919 --> 00:47:24.460
that values your past
more than your future?"

868
00:47:24.543 --> 00:47:26.460
They said. "Oh. no."

869
00:47:26.543 --> 00:47:28.293
Now. look.
I understand heritage.

870
00:47:28.377 --> 00:47:29.669
and I understand culture.

871
00:47:29.752 --> 00:47:32.710
but if you may offend somebody
that might want to invest here

872
00:47:32.794 --> 00:47:36.210
and create jobs here.
why would you do that?

873
00:47:47.752 --> 00:47:50.877
- It's a real shock when
traditional jobs disappear...

874
00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:54.126
- The future will be working
alongside the robots.

875
00:47:54.210 --> 00:47:56.001
- And the new ones call
for skills

876
00:47:56.085 --> 00:47:58.126
that local people don't have.

877
00:47:58.210 --> 00:48:00.335
As we've seen
around the country.

878
00:48:00.418 --> 00:48:02.710
community colleges
are incredibly important

879
00:48:02.794 --> 00:48:05.502
in preparing students
for new jobs

880
00:48:05.585 --> 00:48:09.877
and. in the bigger picture.
fighting inequality.

881
00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:13.960
This is the Communiversity
near Columbus. Mississippi.

882
00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:18.377
- This is highly technical.

883
00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:20.377
It is not the old shop.

884
00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:23.377
The old vocational school
was sometimes

885
00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:26.210
a penalty a person paid.

886
00:48:26.293 --> 00:48:28.377
- Press at every station.

887
00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:30.043
- We are second chances

888
00:48:30.126 --> 00:48:33.502
for people to get
that high-school equivalency.

889
00:48:33.585 --> 00:48:35.543
to get a job.

890
00:48:35.627 --> 00:48:37.919
Many individuals
in our community

891
00:48:38.001 --> 00:48:42.418
are one flat tire away
from losing their job

892
00:48:42.502 --> 00:48:45.126
or not finishing
their education.

893
00:48:45.210 --> 00:48:49.460
We help bring partners
to removing those barriers.

894
00:48:49.543 --> 00:48:53.752
We lift up the community
as a whole.

895
00:48:53.835 --> 00:48:57.960
- That's the best description
of community college

896
00:48:58.043 --> 00:49:01.126
and what you do
that I've heard anywhere.

897
00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:03.877
- If it can happen here

898
00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:06.710
in the poorest of all states.

899
00:49:06.794 --> 00:49:09.919
then surely the positive things

900
00:49:10.001 --> 00:49:12.251
are replicable elsewhere.

901
00:49:20.502 --> 00:49:21.627
- You go into this business

902
00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:23.251
because you love
this business.

903
00:49:23.335 --> 00:49:25.126
because it is
the most interesting way

904
00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:28.126
you can possibly spend
your life.

905
00:49:28.210 --> 00:49:31.585
An unexpected truth about
most people who are reporters.

906
00:49:31.669 --> 00:49:32.794
including me.

907
00:49:32.877 --> 00:49:35.919
almost all
professional reporters

908
00:49:36.001 --> 00:49:39.210
are psychologically introverts
and shy.

909
00:49:39.293 --> 00:49:43.794
And so you are looking
for a structural excuse

910
00:49:43.877 --> 00:49:45.960
to go out in the world.
meet people.

911
00:49:46.043 --> 00:49:47.251
and ask them about things.

912
00:49:47.335 --> 00:49:50.126
If I'm just on the street.
I'm not gonna talk to anybody.

913
00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:52.293
But if I'm on the street
as a reporter.

914
00:49:52.377 --> 00:49:54.126
I'm gonna talk to everybody.

915
00:49:54.210 --> 00:49:57.126
I have a license to say.
"Tell me your story.

916
00:49:57.210 --> 00:49:59.794
Tell me your hopes.
Tell me what I don't know."

917
00:49:59.877 --> 00:50:03.502
There's this secret power
that being a journalist gives

918
00:50:03.585 --> 00:50:06.502
to almost everybody I know
in this business.

919
00:50:14.919 --> 00:50:17.627
- At the far eastern tip
of the United States

920
00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:21.168
is the tiny town
of Eastport. Maine.

921
00:50:21.251 --> 00:50:24.335
- When we very first came here
in 2013. I did an article.

922
00:50:24.418 --> 00:50:28.335
Its headline was.
"The Little Town That Might."

923
00:50:28.418 --> 00:50:30.877
The conclusion was.
"Will Eastport make it?

924
00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:32.669
I don't know."

925
00:50:32.752 --> 00:50:36.502
Eastport has the deepest port
on the East Coast.

926
00:50:36.585 --> 00:50:39.168
On the other hand.
it's so far away.

927
00:50:42.251 --> 00:50:44.502
- There are just
not many people--

928
00:50:44.585 --> 00:50:46.210
1.300 people

929
00:50:46.293 --> 00:50:48.210
in a town that used to have
about 10.000

930
00:50:48.293 --> 00:50:51.210
in its heyday
of sardine fishing.

931
00:50:51.293 --> 00:50:54.585
The town has had
so many surprising disasters

932
00:50:54.669 --> 00:50:56.043
come their way.

933
00:50:56.126 --> 00:50:59.043
Everything on Main Street
burned down in 1887

934
00:50:59.126 --> 00:51:01.085
or just before.
and they had to rebuild

935
00:51:01.168 --> 00:51:03.251
the entire main street
of the town.

936
00:51:03.335 --> 00:51:06.168
which they have
in a beautiful fashion.

937
00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:14.794
- That was a sardine place.

938
00:51:14.877 --> 00:51:16.877
That was the last one in this
area. wasn't it. Dickie?

939
00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:18.919
- It was '83
I started working there.

940
00:51:19.001 --> 00:51:20.710
And I got laid off
'cause there was no fish.

941
00:51:20.794 --> 00:51:22.043
so I went blueberry raking.

942
00:51:22.126 --> 00:51:23.919
Happiest phone call I ever got.
Said. "We got fish."

943
00:51:24.001 --> 00:51:27.251
I said. "I'll be back."

944
00:51:27.335 --> 00:51:30.085
Man. that clam digging.
Nope.

945
00:51:31.335 --> 00:51:32.752
- You have to love
living here.

946
00:51:32.835 --> 00:51:33.919
If you don't love living here.

947
00:51:34.001 --> 00:51:36.585
you wouldn't put the work in
that it requires.

948
00:51:36.669 --> 00:51:39.460
People are doing one. two.
three different things.

949
00:51:39.543 --> 00:51:41.919
I'm the executive director
of the Port Authority.

950
00:51:42.001 --> 00:51:44.627
I'm also a reserve police
officer here in town.

951
00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:46.710
I'm the chairman
of the county commissioners.

952
00:51:46.794 --> 00:51:49.085
I coach soccer
at a local high school.

953
00:51:49.168 --> 00:51:50.919
And--oh. and my wife and I.

954
00:51:51.001 --> 00:51:53.794
we flip real estate on the side
in our spare time.

955
00:51:53.877 --> 00:51:57.585
That's the commitment that
you have to put in to be here.

956
00:51:57.669 --> 00:51:59.794
It is a different type
of person.

957
00:51:59.877 --> 00:52:01.085
"Resourceful" is probably

958
00:52:01.168 --> 00:52:02.919
the best word
that I can come up with.

959
00:52:08.794 --> 00:52:10.460
- I'd say there's
kind of two Eastports.

960
00:52:10.543 --> 00:52:12.001
Right now we're
in the colored Eastport.

961
00:52:12.085 --> 00:52:13.794
It's summertime. and there's
a lot of people around.

962
00:52:13.877 --> 00:52:16.627
There's things
constantly happening.

963
00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:20.335
And then there's sepia-toned
Eastport in the wintertime.

964
00:52:20.418 --> 00:52:22.710
where everything
kind of calms down.

965
00:52:22.794 --> 00:52:24.126
A lot of the colors go away.

966
00:52:24.210 --> 00:52:29.168
but it's also a cleanse
spiritually and for your mind.

967
00:52:34.543 --> 00:52:36.960
I'm 17. I'm a senior
at Shead High School.

968
00:52:37.043 --> 00:52:39.460
and I also take
online college classes

969
00:52:39.543 --> 00:52:41.835
with the UMaine system.

970
00:52:41.919 --> 00:52:44.335
And I'll going on to either go
to Maine Maritime

971
00:52:44.418 --> 00:52:46.335
for marine transportations
and operations.

972
00:52:46.418 --> 00:52:48.669
or I'll be headed off
to a trade school.

973
00:52:53.251 --> 00:52:55.001
I moved to Eastport
seven. eight years ago

974
00:52:55.085 --> 00:52:56.710
with my parents
from the Jersey Shore.

975
00:52:56.794 --> 00:52:59.210
I've kind of seen
how city life is.

976
00:52:59.293 --> 00:53:01.293
I much prefer this.

977
00:53:01.377 --> 00:53:04.168
It's summertime right now.
Primarily. I'm a lobsterman.

978
00:53:04.251 --> 00:53:06.669
Spend most of my day in this
fishing aspect of Eastport.

979
00:53:06.752 --> 00:53:08.001
which is one life.

980
00:53:08.085 --> 00:53:09.835
but then I'll go home.
and I'll shower.

981
00:53:09.919 --> 00:53:12.168
and I go out to the arts center
to a gallery opening

982
00:53:12.251 --> 00:53:14.418
or a gig
or a classical concert.

983
00:53:21.669 --> 00:53:22.835
With climate change and all.

984
00:53:22.919 --> 00:53:24.210
I'm not really expecting
to fish

985
00:53:24.293 --> 00:53:26.001
for more than 15 years
lobstering.

986
00:53:26.085 --> 00:53:28.210
I think it's gonna move north.

987
00:53:28.293 --> 00:53:30.001
I think we're gonna have
more opportunities

988
00:53:30.085 --> 00:53:31.460
for the oysters and mussels.

989
00:53:31.543 --> 00:53:33.168
and I'd like to take my
lobstering money and put that

990
00:53:33.251 --> 00:53:35.043
into a sustainable
aquaculture business.

991
00:53:35.126 --> 00:53:36.710
employing a lot
of local people.

992
00:53:36.794 --> 00:53:39.335
but I think lobstering's gonna
go away.

993
00:54:09.168 --> 00:54:12.502
- In 2003. a group called
The Women of the Commons

994
00:54:12.585 --> 00:54:15.293
renovated a run-down building
down the waterfront.

995
00:54:15.377 --> 00:54:19.126
making a shop and gallery
space for local artists.

996
00:54:19.210 --> 00:54:21.752
- 2003. there were a lot
of boarded-up buildings.

997
00:54:21.835 --> 00:54:25.251
They were a new kind of energy
for the downtown.

998
00:54:25.335 --> 00:54:27.460
Okay. just checking.
- Good. yep.

999
00:54:27.543 --> 00:54:29.794
- Some of them are from here.
some of them aren't.

1000
00:54:29.877 --> 00:54:31.794
Otherwise. things are good?
- Yes.

1001
00:54:31.877 --> 00:54:36.043
I'm about to call for more
copies of "The Lonely Loon."

1002
00:54:36.126 --> 00:54:39.126
- Now they've taken
on an even bigger project--

1003
00:54:39.210 --> 00:54:42.085
turning an old sardine cannery
into workspaces.

1004
00:54:42.168 --> 00:54:44.001
restaurants. and apartments.

1005
00:54:51.335 --> 00:54:54.001
- We'll hopefully get this done
by the end of September.

1006
00:54:54.085 --> 00:54:55.001
- Uh-huh.

1007
00:54:55.085 --> 00:54:56.794
Hugh French grew up
in Eastport.

1008
00:54:56.877 --> 00:54:58.585
Like people we've met
all over the country.

1009
00:54:58.669 --> 00:55:02.418
he moved away. then came home
to try to help his town.

1010
00:55:02.502 --> 00:55:04.251
He started the Tides Institute

1011
00:55:04.335 --> 00:55:07.043
with his wife.
Kristin McKinlay.

1012
00:55:07.126 --> 00:55:09.627
- We're committed
to this place.

1013
00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:12.085
That means collections.
exhibitions.

1014
00:55:12.168 --> 00:55:13.168
fostering new work.

1015
00:55:13.251 --> 00:55:15.960
getting involved
in the downtown heavily.

1016
00:55:16.043 --> 00:55:18.585
That's how you create change.

1017
00:55:18.669 --> 00:55:19.669
- One of our programs

1018
00:55:19.752 --> 00:55:21.960
is the StudioWorks
Artist-in-Residence Program.

1019
00:55:22.043 --> 00:55:24.001
So this year
we'll have 13 artists.

1020
00:55:27.502 --> 00:55:29.251
- My interaction with the tide

1021
00:55:29.335 --> 00:55:31.627
has been to wrap the pilings

1022
00:55:31.710 --> 00:55:34.794
of this old sardine factory.

1023
00:55:34.877 --> 00:55:35.960
I came up from Brooklyn.

1024
00:55:36.043 --> 00:55:38.627
and we get a month
in this little town

1025
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:40.460
and make work based on it.

1026
00:55:42.085 --> 00:55:44.168
Eastport. it's amazing.

1027
00:55:44.251 --> 00:55:47.669
People are cool and weird.

1028
00:55:47.752 --> 00:55:48.960
and I'm weird.

1029
00:56:01.627 --> 00:56:04.168
- The Passamaquoddy tribes
near Eastport

1030
00:56:04.251 --> 00:56:06.669
celebrate their history
every summer.

1031
00:56:06.752 --> 00:56:09.877
- We're proud Passamaquoddies
of this time of year

1032
00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:11.293
and all the time.

1033
00:56:13.251 --> 00:56:15.669
- The Ancestral Paddle really
symbolizes what we've done

1034
00:56:15.752 --> 00:56:16.919
for thousands of years

1035
00:56:17.001 --> 00:56:19.710
using the waterways
to sustain ourselves.

1036
00:56:26.794 --> 00:56:30.835
- In its time.
Eastport has found and lost

1037
00:56:30.919 --> 00:56:33.669
so many ways
of sustaining itself.

1038
00:56:35.418 --> 00:56:38.210
It was once one of the busiest
shipping ports

1039
00:56:38.293 --> 00:56:40.669
till shipping went elsewhere.

1040
00:56:40.752 --> 00:56:43.877
There were
13 sardine canneries

1041
00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:45.794
on the waterfront.

1042
00:56:45.877 --> 00:56:48.502
but that industry moved
to Canada.

1043
00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:53.710
Traditional salmon fishing
ended

1044
00:56:53.794 --> 00:56:56.669
when the wild fish
were depleted.

1045
00:56:56.752 --> 00:56:58.669
Now there are salmon farms.

1046
00:57:05.710 --> 00:57:08.919
The town has invested millions
in the cargo pier

1047
00:57:09.001 --> 00:57:12.585
so they can ship wood pulp
from Maine forests.

1048
00:57:12.669 --> 00:57:14.293
- And we're one
of the last places

1049
00:57:14.377 --> 00:57:17.126
on the East Coast of the U.S..
if not the last place.

1050
00:57:17.210 --> 00:57:19.251
where the forest comes right
to the sea.

1051
00:57:19.335 --> 00:57:23.210
We've done up to 400.000 tons
in one year. just wood pulp.

1052
00:57:26.335 --> 00:57:27.585
- How does a town like this

1053
00:57:27.669 --> 00:57:32.085
keep coming up with new ways
to create a future for itself?

1054
00:57:32.168 --> 00:57:37.085
It's not like Downeast Mainers
are famous for their optimism.

1055
00:57:37.168 --> 00:57:41.085
There's a fine line between
looking for the possibilities

1056
00:57:41.168 --> 00:57:43.085
and denying reality.

1057
00:57:43.168 --> 00:57:45.085
When we lived in China.
we used to joke

1058
00:57:45.168 --> 00:57:47.960
about how all the headlines
in the papers were

1059
00:57:48.043 --> 00:57:51.919
"Happiness Sweeps Nation
as Joy Abounds" or something.

1060
00:57:52.001 --> 00:57:54.168
And so I think that
you don't want to have

1061
00:57:54.251 --> 00:57:57.919
this kind of denying reality
happy talk.

1062
00:57:58.001 --> 00:58:00.126
But sometimes you just have
to try things.

1063
00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:01.669
realistic or not.

1064
00:58:05.877 --> 00:58:08.168
- Pregnant cows.

1065
00:58:08.251 --> 00:58:09.794
In 2010.
we did get a phone call

1066
00:58:09.877 --> 00:58:11.126
from a company
that was interested

1067
00:58:11.210 --> 00:58:13.794
in exporting pregnant
dairy cattle.

1068
00:58:13.877 --> 00:58:15.502
Okay. they want to put
a pregnant cow in a box

1069
00:58:15.585 --> 00:58:18.794
and ship it to parts
all over the world.

1070
00:58:18.877 --> 00:58:20.043
My general manager said.

1071
00:58:20.126 --> 00:58:22.460
"We don't know anything
about shipping pregnant cows."

1072
00:58:22.543 --> 00:58:25.126
I said. "Skip.
neither does anybody else."

1073
00:58:25.210 --> 00:58:28.168
What started off as
a little adventure of 450 cows

1074
00:58:28.251 --> 00:58:30.710
turned into approximately
50.000 head of cattle

1075
00:58:30.794 --> 00:58:34.335
that was exported
through the port of Eastport.

1076
00:58:34.418 --> 00:58:37.877
But the area of Turkey
these cows kind of went to

1077
00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:40.835
was affected mightily
by the Syrian conflict

1078
00:58:40.919 --> 00:58:43.168
there on the border.
and as a result.

1079
00:58:43.251 --> 00:58:46.126
right now that industry
has dried up and stopped.

1080
00:58:46.210 --> 00:58:47.460
You know. geopolitical forces.

1081
00:58:47.543 --> 00:58:50.168
we think. just. you know.
matter on TV.

1082
00:58:50.251 --> 00:58:52.126
But even in a small town.
they can affect

1083
00:58:52.210 --> 00:58:54.919
how many pregnant dairy cattle
we put in a box.

1084
00:59:01.126 --> 00:59:02.794
- Thanks to the Internet.

1085
00:59:02.877 --> 00:59:05.293
small towns have the
same access to national news

1086
00:59:05.377 --> 00:59:07.585
as big cities...

1087
00:59:07.669 --> 00:59:11.001
but local news
is a different story.

1088
00:59:13.126 --> 00:59:14.335
In many towns.

1089
00:59:14.418 --> 00:59:16.877
the local papers
have gone out of business.

1090
00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:18.877
or they're taken over
by investors

1091
00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:20.752
who cut local coverage.

1092
00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:25.794
Eastport's paper
is "The Quoddy Tides."

1093
00:59:25.877 --> 00:59:29.210
- My brother Hugh is director
of the Tides Institute.

1094
00:59:29.293 --> 00:59:30.669
We bookend the downtown.

1095
00:59:30.752 --> 00:59:32.502
with the Tides Institute
on one end

1096
00:59:32.585 --> 00:59:34.502
and "The Quoddy Tides"
on the other end.

1097
00:59:34.585 --> 00:59:37.543
"The Quoddy Tides" started
in 1968 by my mother.

1098
00:59:37.627 --> 00:59:39.502
- Edward French is the editor.

1099
00:59:39.585 --> 00:59:42.043
He publishes it with his wife.
Lora Whelan.

1100
00:59:42.126 --> 00:59:43.377
She's also a reporter.

1101
00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:46.043
- Papers like this
around the country

1102
00:59:46.126 --> 00:59:48.293
are under all kinds
of pressure.

1103
00:59:48.377 --> 00:59:51.752
Your paper is thick. and it is
absolutely full of news

1104
00:59:51.835 --> 00:59:53.543
from 20 correspondents.

1105
00:59:53.627 --> 00:59:54.627
What's your secret?

1106
00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:56.085
- I don't know
that we have a secret.

1107
00:59:56.168 --> 01:00:00.377
but I think it's important for
newspapers not to keep cutting.

1108
01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:02.126
because if you keep cutting.

1109
01:00:02.210 --> 01:00:05.251
there's less and less reason
for people to buy the paper.

1110
01:00:05.335 --> 01:00:06.543
- We try to focus

1111
01:00:06.627 --> 01:00:09.919
in a way that relates directly
to local issues.

1112
01:00:10.001 --> 01:00:11.418
- So we've had
long debates here

1113
01:00:11.502 --> 01:00:14.752
over an oil refinery
or the tribal casinos.

1114
01:00:14.835 --> 01:00:17.085
And we present
what's happened elsewhere.

1115
01:00:17.168 --> 01:00:18.960
Communities that don't have
a local paper.

1116
01:00:19.043 --> 01:00:22.585
the cost for local government
increases. for instance.

1117
01:00:22.669 --> 01:00:26.460
We try not to enter into
the national debate too much.

1118
01:00:26.543 --> 01:00:29.085
It can. particularly
in this polarized time.

1119
01:00:29.168 --> 01:00:30.794
just put people off.

1120
01:00:30.877 --> 01:00:33.502
- Playing the role of the
newspaper in a small community

1121
01:00:33.585 --> 01:00:35.585
is always a delicate balance.

1122
01:00:35.669 --> 01:00:36.960
- I always feel. you know.

1123
01:00:37.043 --> 01:00:40.752
I'm okay as long as there's
no more the half the population

1124
01:00:40.835 --> 01:00:42.126
that crosses over
to the other side

1125
01:00:42.210 --> 01:00:44.168
when I walk down the street
because they don't want

1126
01:00:44.251 --> 01:00:45.502
to talk to me.

1127
01:00:45.585 --> 01:00:47.960
- People will come up to you
or give you a call and say.

1128
01:00:48.043 --> 01:00:49.293
"This is what
I'm worried about.

1129
01:00:49.377 --> 01:00:50.835
"Is there any way
that you can look into it

1130
01:00:50.919 --> 01:00:52.293
and write about it?"

1131
01:00:52.377 --> 01:00:54.627
That's a really
beautiful feeling

1132
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:56.669
to have someone trust you
like that.

1133
01:00:56.752 --> 01:00:58.085
- Right. right.
- Yeah.

1134
01:00:58.168 --> 01:00:59.502
- We try to provide a voice
for the people

1135
01:00:59.585 --> 01:01:01.502
and the communities
that might otherwise

1136
01:01:01.585 --> 01:01:02.752
might not have a voice

1137
01:01:02.835 --> 01:01:07.627
so that people in power have
to address their concerns.

1138
01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:10.085
I think without
community newspapers.

1139
01:01:10.168 --> 01:01:12.460
democracy will really suffer.

1140
01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:22.168
- We've now been to Eastport
five times in six years.

1141
01:01:22.251 --> 01:01:25.377
Maybe asking
if Eastport will make it

1142
01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:27.669
is the wrong question.

1143
01:01:27.752 --> 01:01:32.418
The town was established
over 200 years ago...

1144
01:01:32.502 --> 01:01:33.794
and Native people were here

1145
01:01:33.877 --> 01:01:36.126
for thousands of years
before that.

1146
01:01:39.126 --> 01:01:43.335
Countless generations
have made a life here...

1147
01:01:43.418 --> 01:01:45.835
and countless more will.

1148
01:02:01.919 --> 01:02:03.627
- When you tell somebody
you're from Eastport. Maine.

1149
01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:05.710
or any small town
for that matter.

1150
01:02:05.794 --> 01:02:07.710
they just assume
that you've never seen

1151
01:02:07.794 --> 01:02:09.210
the bright lights
and the big city.

1152
01:02:09.293 --> 01:02:11.877
They'll look at you and say.
"Well. this is a cell phone.

1153
01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:14.043
You ever seen one
of those before?"

1154
01:02:14.126 --> 01:02:15.043
It's just that belief

1155
01:02:15.126 --> 01:02:16.835
that. somehow.
by living out here.

1156
01:02:16.919 --> 01:02:19.210
we're not as metropolitan
and as savvy

1157
01:02:19.293 --> 01:02:21.627
as to what's going on
with the world.

1158
01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:24.210
I would argue perhaps we know
it even a little better

1159
01:02:24.293 --> 01:02:27.335
because we take the time
to focus on it.

1160
01:02:27.418 --> 01:02:29.377
and that makes us
a whole lot more worldly

1161
01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:30.877
than people believe.

1162
01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:33.293
That's probably one stick jab.
if you will.

1163
01:02:33.377 --> 01:02:34.543
from if you go to a big city

1164
01:02:34.627 --> 01:02:37.085
and somebody finds out you're
from a small town.

1165
01:02:37.168 --> 01:02:40.043
They just assume that you
haven't been paying attention.

1166
01:03:07.168 --> 01:03:10.293
- All of the travel and living
in far-flung places

1167
01:03:10.377 --> 01:03:11.460
that we've done

1168
01:03:11.543 --> 01:03:14.627
has also changed
our relationship in some way.

1169
01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:17.210
I mean.
we're stuck together forever

1170
01:03:17.293 --> 01:03:21.126
because we have
so many shared experiences.

1171
01:03:21.210 --> 01:03:24.001
a lot of them challenging.
a lot of them glorious.

1172
01:03:24.085 --> 01:03:27.460
We have a shortcut
for so many things we can say.

1173
01:03:27.543 --> 01:03:29.168
No one else
would ever understand us.

1174
01:03:29.251 --> 01:03:31.585
- Or "grasscutter for dinner."
- Grasscutter for dinner.

1175
01:03:31.669 --> 01:03:33.293
That was Africa.
That was our honeymoon.

1176
01:03:33.377 --> 01:03:35.293
- It was a giant rat.
- Yeah.

1177
01:03:35.377 --> 01:03:37.794
We knew it bonded us
as a family

1178
01:03:37.877 --> 01:03:40.126
when we did a lot of this
travel with our little kids.

1179
01:03:40.210 --> 01:03:42.168
We were a unit.
and sink or swim.

1180
01:03:42.251 --> 01:03:43.210
we were in this together.

1181
01:03:43.293 --> 01:03:44.627
We had to figure it all out.

1182
01:03:53.877 --> 01:03:55.752
- Historically.
geographically.

1183
01:03:55.835 --> 01:03:57.627
very difficult
to get through here.

1184
01:04:00.919 --> 01:04:02.043
People that came over here.

1185
01:04:02.126 --> 01:04:03.669
they were okay
with being isolated.

1186
01:04:03.752 --> 01:04:05.001
They had to be.

1187
01:04:05.085 --> 01:04:08.543
If you have
a tougher kind of person...

1188
01:04:08.627 --> 01:04:11.210
There was a poet laureate.
Louise McNeill.

1189
01:04:11.293 --> 01:04:14.502
She wrote a book called
"Gauley Mountain."

1190
01:04:14.585 --> 01:04:17.627
The very last poem in it.
it says the people here

1191
01:04:17.710 --> 01:04:21.794
"now possess the last dark
current of the wilderness."

1192
01:04:25.126 --> 01:04:26.794
- Jeff. could you give me
a level check?

1193
01:04:26.877 --> 01:04:29.460
- Hi. this is Jeff Daniels
with the Ben Daniels Band.

1194
01:04:29.543 --> 01:04:30.669
Join us this week

1195
01:04:30.752 --> 01:04:33.585
in live performance
on "Mountain Stage."

1196
01:05:01.418 --> 01:05:03.710
- West Virginia tends
to make the national news

1197
01:05:03.794 --> 01:05:05.710
for a few.
predictable things...

1198
01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:10.710
The collapse of coal mining

1199
01:05:10.794 --> 01:05:12.585
and for being one
of the first places

1200
01:05:12.669 --> 01:05:14.585
hit hard by the opioid crisis.

1201
01:05:17.043 --> 01:05:19.585
There are
growth problems. too.

1202
01:05:19.669 --> 01:05:23.710
Charleston has about half as
many people as it did in 1960.

1203
01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:38.043
- We have a few rules
when we go to a new city.

1204
01:05:38.126 --> 01:05:40.460
We never ask
about national politics

1205
01:05:40.543 --> 01:05:44.085
because that conversation
goes nowhere.

1206
01:05:44.168 --> 01:05:46.251
Airspeed is coming alive.

1207
01:05:46.335 --> 01:05:50.251
79 knots and full power.
Up we go.

1208
01:05:50.335 --> 01:05:51.502
- We do look for things

1209
01:05:51.585 --> 01:05:54.126
that people are struggling
with or achieving locally

1210
01:05:54.210 --> 01:05:56.919
that the national press
doesn't usually notice.

1211
01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:07.794
- The "Mountain Stage"!

1212
01:06:12.085 --> 01:06:13.752
- The West Side of Charleston

1213
01:06:13.835 --> 01:06:15.418
looks like what
you might expect

1214
01:06:15.502 --> 01:06:17.752
when you hear
about the city's troubles...

1215
01:06:19.377 --> 01:06:22.669
But every town is full
of things you don't expect.

1216
01:06:36.168 --> 01:06:38.502
- John and Tighe and
Ellen Bullock came up to me.

1217
01:06:38.585 --> 01:06:40.251
and I thought
they wanted me to paint

1218
01:06:40.335 --> 01:06:42.794
something on their building
like an advertisement.

1219
01:06:42.877 --> 01:06:44.335
And they said. "No. no.

1220
01:06:44.418 --> 01:06:46.335
"We want you to paint something
on the building

1221
01:06:46.418 --> 01:06:48.960
"that will change
the community.

1222
01:06:49.043 --> 01:06:52.210
change community.
change this whole place here."

1223
01:06:55.210 --> 01:06:59.126
These are Union troops
from the 34th Ohio Regiment.

1224
01:06:59.210 --> 01:07:00.835
They were stationed
right over here.

1225
01:07:00.919 --> 01:07:03.168
Painted some homeless people.

1226
01:07:03.251 --> 01:07:05.543
Her name was Froggy.
She passed away.

1227
01:07:05.627 --> 01:07:08.335
And Jim pushed her around.

1228
01:07:08.418 --> 01:07:10.502
She was a Navy veteran.

1229
01:07:10.585 --> 01:07:13.377
Natalie Tennant.
first female mountaineer.

1230
01:07:15.001 --> 01:07:16.502
Just various people came by.

1231
01:07:16.585 --> 01:07:18.669
Smitty would come by every day
and say.

1232
01:07:18.752 --> 01:07:20.335
"You got to put me in
with my dog.

1233
01:07:20.418 --> 01:07:22.168
You got to put me in there
with my dog."

1234
01:07:22.251 --> 01:07:23.502
I said. "Where's your dog?"

1235
01:07:23.585 --> 01:07:25.669
He said. "Oh. my dog's
been dead for ten years."

1236
01:07:25.752 --> 01:07:27.251
I said. "Oh. oh."

1237
01:07:31.251 --> 01:07:33.085
- I'm from a small coal town
in West Virginia

1238
01:07:33.168 --> 01:07:35.377
that had just become
dilapidated over the years.

1239
01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:38.377
and when I moved to Charleston
and I saw this neighborhood.

1240
01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:41.543
I thought. "Why is nothing
being done about it?"

1241
01:07:41.627 --> 01:07:43.502
Tighe Bullock
and his sister Megan

1242
01:07:43.585 --> 01:07:47.460
have been renovating old
buildings on the West Side.

1243
01:07:47.543 --> 01:07:49.293
- This was my first project.

1244
01:07:49.377 --> 01:07:50.835
It's the Bully Trap
Barber Shop.

1245
01:07:50.919 --> 01:07:53.502
Elk City Records.

1246
01:07:53.585 --> 01:07:56.251
This is Charleston's
newest distillery.

1247
01:07:56.335 --> 01:07:59.251
We're gonna do a quality
West Virginia corn whiskey.

1248
01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:05.710
This is a future
Books and Brews site.

1249
01:08:05.794 --> 01:08:06.835
- I was a coal miner.

1250
01:08:06.919 --> 01:08:09.710
I started off mining
at the age of 18. actually.

1251
01:08:09.794 --> 01:08:11.043
Right before bankruptcy.

1252
01:08:11.126 --> 01:08:13.585
kind of exited out
and opened a restaurant.

1253
01:08:13.669 --> 01:08:15.251
- He's so committed
to the project

1254
01:08:15.335 --> 01:08:17.669
that he actually moved his
family in across the street.

1255
01:08:20.877 --> 01:08:22.210
- Back in the studios

1256
01:08:22.293 --> 01:08:25.460
at 580 WCHS. the voice
of Charleston. West Virginia.

1257
01:08:25.543 --> 01:08:28.418
And I have some special guests
in the studio.

1258
01:08:28.502 --> 01:08:30.794
James and Deb Fallows.

1259
01:08:30.877 --> 01:08:32.919
And these are--
Good morning.

1260
01:08:33.001 --> 01:08:34.377
- Good morning. Mr. Mayor.
- Good morning.

1261
01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:38.251
When we were here in 2014
at the election time.

1262
01:08:38.335 --> 01:08:40.418
there was a levy
for the library.

1263
01:08:40.502 --> 01:08:41.669
People waving placards saying

1264
01:08:41.752 --> 01:08:43.919
"come vote yes
on the library levy."

1265
01:08:44.001 --> 01:08:45.126
and it passed.

1266
01:08:45.210 --> 01:08:46.919
- Yeah. but they have
another one.

1267
01:08:47.001 --> 01:08:48.418
Might be hard.

1268
01:08:48.502 --> 01:08:50.126
You know.
the argument against it.

1269
01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:52.460
ladies and gents.
is the fact that.

1270
01:08:52.543 --> 01:08:54.418
"We don't need libraries.
We have computers."

1271
01:08:54.502 --> 01:08:55.960
- Oh. Deb has
the whole counter-argument.

1272
01:08:56.043 --> 01:08:56.960
- Oh. no. oh. no.
Wrong answer.

1273
01:08:57.043 --> 01:08:59.043
- Well. then take it. Deb.
Take it. take it.

1274
01:08:59.126 --> 01:09:01.251
- Really. the libraries
are the heart and soul

1275
01:09:01.335 --> 01:09:02.669
of the communities.

1276
01:09:02.752 --> 01:09:03.835
It's more than books.

1277
01:09:03.919 --> 01:09:06.502
and it's more than computers
and resources now.

1278
01:09:06.585 --> 01:09:08.835
Libraries have become
a combination

1279
01:09:08.919 --> 01:09:12.168
of education centers.
civic and social center.

1280
01:09:12.251 --> 01:09:15.585
There are classes on how
to do your job résumé...

1281
01:09:15.669 --> 01:09:17.460
- Go ahead and write.
"in eBay" there for me.

1282
01:09:17.543 --> 01:09:19.627
- How to be an eBay merchant.

1283
01:09:19.710 --> 01:09:22.418
Libraries have free sessions
with a nurse.

1284
01:09:22.502 --> 01:09:24.960
or they'll bring in a lawyer.

1285
01:09:25.043 --> 01:09:27.293
If you go into any public
library in the country.

1286
01:09:27.377 --> 01:09:29.960
people who don't have
computers at home or Wi-Fi

1287
01:09:30.043 --> 01:09:31.293
will come for access.

1288
01:09:31.377 --> 01:09:34.168
which is. as we know
these days. just critical.

1289
01:09:34.251 --> 01:09:35.669
I would really argue.

1290
01:09:35.752 --> 01:09:37.835
"Yes.
Vote yes on that library levy."

1291
01:09:37.919 --> 01:09:40.001
- I'll vote for it
if that helps any.

1292
01:09:40.085 --> 01:09:42.043
All right.
James Fallows and Deb Fallows.

1293
01:09:42.126 --> 01:09:44.752
We'll break. and we'll back
on 580 live.

1294
01:09:52.126 --> 01:09:55.210
- I came here when I was 22
on a grant.

1295
01:09:55.293 --> 01:09:56.794
I lived in Los Angeles
at that time.

1296
01:09:56.877 --> 01:09:58.377
Beginning. From the beginning.
From the very beginning.

1297
01:09:58.460 --> 01:09:59.669
I took to it immediately.

1298
01:09:59.752 --> 01:10:02.293
Loved the people. the country.

1299
01:10:02.377 --> 01:10:04.001
So beautiful.

1300
01:10:04.085 --> 01:10:05.377
You count it down and--

1301
01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:06.835
Started "Mountain Stage."

1302
01:10:06.919 --> 01:10:07.835
Public broadcasting.

1303
01:10:07.919 --> 01:10:08.835
West Virginia
public broadcasting.

1304
01:10:08.919 --> 01:10:10.835
wants to do a live show
on radio.

1305
01:10:10.919 --> 01:10:12.835
We had no expertise.
We had no equipment.

1306
01:10:12.919 --> 01:10:14.001
We had no money.

1307
01:10:14.085 --> 01:10:16.710
Took us 26 shows
till NPR invited us

1308
01:10:16.794 --> 01:10:18.377
to be a national radio show.

1309
01:10:20.335 --> 01:10:21.543
- Our host and co-founder.

1310
01:10:21.627 --> 01:10:23.710
he's also the artistic
director of "Mountain Stage."

1311
01:10:23.794 --> 01:10:25.377
Mr. Larry Groce.

1312
01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:27.877
- Like that! Beautiful.

1313
01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:29.710
Okay. here we go.
Thank you guys for coming.

1314
01:10:29.794 --> 01:10:31.418
I hope that you enjoy the show.

1315
01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:36.085
- When you're out of here.
you find out sooner than later

1316
01:10:36.168 --> 01:10:38.251
that people have a
certain view of West Virginia.

1317
01:10:38.335 --> 01:10:39.877
People in the big picture.

1318
01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:41.335
They assume certain things
about you.

1319
01:10:41.418 --> 01:10:42.919
and they assume
you have limitations.

1320
01:10:43.001 --> 01:10:44.919
and they assume that
you're gonna be a certain way

1321
01:10:45.001 --> 01:10:46.752
and your style is gonna be
a certain way

1322
01:10:46.835 --> 01:10:48.752
because that's
what people do there.

1323
01:10:48.835 --> 01:10:50.085
And. of course.
that's not the way it is.

1324
01:10:50.168 --> 01:10:51.710
I mean. people here
are like everywhere.

1325
01:10:51.794 --> 01:10:53.502
Their tastes are wide.

1326
01:10:53.585 --> 01:10:55.210
They like a lot of kinds
of music.

1327
01:11:06.001 --> 01:11:07.919
- But I think it's gonna take
a long time

1328
01:11:08.001 --> 01:11:11.377
to reverse some stereotypes
that people have.

1329
01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:13.126
I mean.
it's gonna be a long time

1330
01:11:13.210 --> 01:11:16.418
before people see West Virginia
like they see Vermont.

1331
01:11:16.502 --> 01:11:18.377
even though we have a lot
of similarities.

1332
01:11:23.335 --> 01:11:25.585
- When you tell people
you're from Charleston.

1333
01:11:25.669 --> 01:11:28.710
what's the main thing you feel
like they misunderstand?

1334
01:11:28.794 --> 01:11:30.460
- Well. usually when you say
you're from Charleston.

1335
01:11:30.543 --> 01:11:33.418
they say. "I love
your fabulous restaurants."

1336
01:11:33.502 --> 01:11:34.418
- Yes. okay.

1337
01:11:34.502 --> 01:11:35.919
- "I love the"...

1338
01:11:36.001 --> 01:11:38.460
- The coastline.

1339
01:11:38.543 --> 01:11:41.210
- I say.
"Charleston. West Virginia."

1340
01:11:41.293 --> 01:11:43.960
not South Carolina.
and they say. "Oh."

1341
01:11:45.251 --> 01:11:47.543
- And what do they say then?

1342
01:11:47.627 --> 01:11:51.293
- Like. "Sorry."
Like. feel sorry for us.

1343
01:11:51.377 --> 01:11:54.669
- In 2016.
the "Gazette-Mail" exposed

1344
01:11:54.752 --> 01:11:57.835
how pharmaceutical companies
were dumping massive amounts

1345
01:11:57.919 --> 01:12:00.627
of opioids on small towns
in the state.

1346
01:12:00.710 --> 01:12:04.585
resulting in the highest
overdose rates in the country.

1347
01:12:04.669 --> 01:12:07.960
Eric Eyre won a Pulitzer
for his reporting.

1348
01:12:08.043 --> 01:12:10.085
- People went
to legitimate doctors at first.

1349
01:12:10.168 --> 01:12:11.919
who actually thought they were
doing the right thing

1350
01:12:12.001 --> 01:12:14.835
because of all the marketing
by Purdue Pharma.

1351
01:12:14.919 --> 01:12:17.960
Then they would get hooked. and
the doctor would cut them off.

1352
01:12:18.043 --> 01:12:20.210
and then they'd wind up
at the pain clinic.

1353
01:12:20.293 --> 01:12:22.168
You had these small towns.

1354
01:12:22.251 --> 01:12:24.001
Kermit. that has 400 people.

1355
01:12:24.085 --> 01:12:26.669
had nearly 9 million
hydrocodone pills

1356
01:12:26.752 --> 01:12:28.168
in two years.

1357
01:12:28.251 --> 01:12:30.293
And they were doing
the same thing here.

1358
01:12:30.377 --> 01:12:31.335
I don't know if you've talked

1359
01:12:31.418 --> 01:12:32.835
to the public health
commissioner--

1360
01:12:32.919 --> 01:12:34.001
- Not yet.

1361
01:12:34.085 --> 01:12:35.168
- His point was

1362
01:12:35.251 --> 01:12:37.835
we're not gonna solve this
addiction crisis overnight.

1363
01:12:37.919 --> 01:12:40.210
but we can stop the deaths.

1364
01:12:42.085 --> 01:12:45.502
She did say that he's supposed
to come to drug court today.

1365
01:12:45.585 --> 01:12:48.794
But his mom said that there's
a bag packed under his bed.

1366
01:12:48.877 --> 01:12:50.460
- He knows he's going
to placement.

1367
01:12:50.543 --> 01:12:51.669
- He's not listening to her.

1368
01:12:51.752 --> 01:12:53.877
He's not doing anything
that she asks.

1369
01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:58.168
- To try to prevent addiction
and crime before they happen.

1370
01:12:58.251 --> 01:13:02.043
Charleston. like many cities.
has a drug court.

1371
01:13:02.126 --> 01:13:04.043
- I don't think we should.
Let's keep him.

1372
01:13:04.126 --> 01:13:06.043
- Keep him.
- Restrict where he goes.

1373
01:13:06.126 --> 01:13:07.043
- Yep.
- Right.

1374
01:13:07.126 --> 01:13:09.210
- Judge Joanna Tabit
and her team

1375
01:13:09.293 --> 01:13:11.168
at the juvenile drug court

1376
01:13:11.251 --> 01:13:13.710
divert teens who've abused
alcohol or drugs

1377
01:13:13.794 --> 01:13:16.710
away from traditional court
or jail.

1378
01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:24.585
As a treat for the kids
for making progress.

1379
01:13:24.669 --> 01:13:27.210
everyone comes out
to the ball game.

1380
01:13:29.669 --> 01:13:30.710
- I'm doing a lot better.

1381
01:13:30.794 --> 01:13:32.418
All my drug screens
have been negative.

1382
01:13:32.502 --> 01:13:35.877
and I've been good
and everything.

1383
01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:38.377
- She'd been. what.
ten when I got you?

1384
01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:41.210
- Yeah.
About six years.

1385
01:13:41.293 --> 01:13:42.460
Yeah.

1386
01:13:42.543 --> 01:13:43.710
If it wasn't for her.

1387
01:13:43.794 --> 01:13:46.752
I wouldn't be getting my head
on straight and going good.

1388
01:13:46.835 --> 01:13:48.919
- And I'm the grandmother.
I'm not the mother.

1389
01:13:49.001 --> 01:13:52.043
I got custody of her.

1390
01:13:52.126 --> 01:13:56.085
I think it's a good program.

1391
01:13:56.168 --> 01:13:57.210
But it's just a lot on me.

1392
01:13:57.293 --> 01:13:59.126
'cause where I work.
strange hours.

1393
01:13:59.210 --> 01:14:01.377
I work 7:00 P to 7:00 A.

1394
01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:03.251
and. you know. sometimes
I get mandated for 16.

1395
01:14:03.335 --> 01:14:07.251
And then you got to go to
drug court or you have to go...

1396
01:14:07.335 --> 01:14:09.752
You know. it's a little
time-consuming.

1397
01:14:09.835 --> 01:14:11.001
but it's working.

1398
01:14:11.085 --> 01:14:12.543
Do whatever works.

1399
01:14:35.043 --> 01:14:37.251
- In the '80s.
as in so many cities.

1400
01:14:37.335 --> 01:14:39.960
an enormous urban mall came
to Charleston

1401
01:14:40.043 --> 01:14:43.293
and crushed
the local downtown stores.

1402
01:14:43.377 --> 01:14:45.502
But years later.
the mall failed.

1403
01:14:45.585 --> 01:14:49.168
and the old downtown started
to revive.

1404
01:14:49.251 --> 01:14:51.001
- We're here
on Capitol Street.

1405
01:14:51.085 --> 01:14:54.168
This is kind of the central.
developed area of Charleston.

1406
01:14:54.251 --> 01:14:55.418
We're gonna visit later on.

1407
01:14:55.502 --> 01:14:57.960
and it's actually where you're
gonna be speaking tonight--

1408
01:14:58.043 --> 01:14:59.460
Taylor Books.

1409
01:14:59.543 --> 01:15:01.126
Ann Saville.
she and her husband

1410
01:15:01.210 --> 01:15:02.627
really became
the anchor tenant

1411
01:15:02.710 --> 01:15:05.627
for the further development
of this area.

1412
01:15:10.043 --> 01:15:13.460
- We had a view of the country

1413
01:15:13.543 --> 01:15:17.335
that was different from the
prevailing view in this way--

1414
01:15:17.418 --> 01:15:19.960
almost every place we went.
people said.

1415
01:15:20.043 --> 01:15:23.210
"Yeah. the U.S. is really
in horrible shape.

1416
01:15:23.293 --> 01:15:26.335
"but here in Starkville.
Mississippi. you know.

1417
01:15:26.418 --> 01:15:27.710
things are really
moving ahead."

1418
01:15:27.794 --> 01:15:31.460
Local-level engagement.
innovation. experimentation

1419
01:15:31.543 --> 01:15:35.001
is actually doing much better.

1420
01:15:35.085 --> 01:15:38.168
In Charleston. they found
some really creative ways

1421
01:15:38.251 --> 01:15:40.669
to rehab the West Side.

1422
01:15:40.752 --> 01:15:44.335
West Invest is a plan
to get teachers and cops

1423
01:15:44.418 --> 01:15:46.877
to move into
challenged neighborhoods.

1424
01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:50.460
where they could help buying
and fixing up a house.

1425
01:15:50.543 --> 01:15:53.377
Two police officers came up
with the idea.

1426
01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:56.043
- You got two guys.
Now. here's our plan.

1427
01:15:56.126 --> 01:15:58.377
Let's get officers this grant.

1428
01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:00.377
They will be able
to take this grant.

1429
01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:03.710
buy a home in what we call
neighborhoods of challenge

1430
01:16:03.794 --> 01:16:06.877
which includes crime.
dilapidated buildings.

1431
01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:09.085
lack of neighborhood norms.

1432
01:16:09.168 --> 01:16:10.543
- You know.
I noticed that yeah.

1433
01:16:10.627 --> 01:16:11.543
a lot of us worked here.

1434
01:16:11.627 --> 01:16:13.210
but a lot of us
didn't live here.

1435
01:16:13.293 --> 01:16:15.877
It's affected
how we policed.

1436
01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:18.043
I just really wanted officers
to move back into the city.

1437
01:16:18.126 --> 01:16:21.835
get that baseline
of how Charleston really is.

1438
01:16:21.919 --> 01:16:23.585
- You just have a real buy-in

1439
01:16:23.669 --> 01:16:26.126
when you live there
with the people and all.

1440
01:16:26.210 --> 01:16:29.335
And they become more
than just neighbors.

1441
01:16:29.418 --> 01:16:30.752
They become family.

1442
01:16:30.835 --> 01:16:31.752
- And. Reverend Ealy.

1443
01:16:31.835 --> 01:16:35.335
I believe this has been
divinely inspired.

1444
01:16:35.418 --> 01:16:37.752
We started
a construction company

1445
01:16:37.835 --> 01:16:40.085
solely to employ felons.

1446
01:16:40.168 --> 01:16:42.752
So. other than
the licensed contractors

1447
01:16:42.835 --> 01:16:46.251
who have agreed to serve
as mentors for these guys.

1448
01:16:46.335 --> 01:16:49.251
if you don't have a felony.
we don't want to talk to you.

1449
01:16:49.335 --> 01:16:51.126
And they'll be paid
the same wage

1450
01:16:51.210 --> 01:16:53.835
as we would pay anybody
in the free world.

1451
01:16:53.919 --> 01:16:56.085
We have banks willing
to come in

1452
01:16:56.168 --> 01:16:58.251
and coach these folks
financially.

1453
01:16:58.335 --> 01:17:00.919
Now we're improving
their credit scores

1454
01:17:01.001 --> 01:17:02.460
before they ever leave prison.

1455
01:17:02.543 --> 01:17:04.752
- I'm going home
in five months.

1456
01:17:04.835 --> 01:17:07.377
Can't wait for that.

1457
01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:09.919
And this here.
it definitely does get you used

1458
01:17:10.001 --> 01:17:12.960
to being not stuck back sitting
with a bunch of inmates.

1459
01:17:13.043 --> 01:17:16.627
- What we're finding is good.
honest. hardworking people

1460
01:17:16.710 --> 01:17:19.960
who just have hit brick wall
after brick wall

1461
01:17:20.043 --> 01:17:22.919
in trying
to get started again.

1462
01:17:35.335 --> 01:17:36.460
- A lot of people tried
to get me

1463
01:17:36.543 --> 01:17:38.085
not to put my restaurant
over here.

1464
01:17:38.168 --> 01:17:39.627
and I'm like. "Why?"

1465
01:17:39.710 --> 01:17:42.627
I said. "If you do it right.
everybody come."

1466
01:17:42.710 --> 01:17:44.627
We have town hall meetings
in here.

1467
01:17:44.710 --> 01:17:46.502
Everybody that's running
for something

1468
01:17:46.585 --> 01:17:49.919
come. want to do something
in here.

1469
01:17:50.001 --> 01:17:53.293
- Adrian Wright played
in the NFL with Tampa Bay.

1470
01:17:53.377 --> 01:17:56.460
He moved back to Charleston
to take care of his mom

1471
01:17:56.543 --> 01:17:59.043
and opened a barbecue place.

1472
01:17:59.126 --> 01:18:00.919
- Here it is
seven years later.

1473
01:18:01.001 --> 01:18:03.335
I'm the number-one barbecue.

1474
01:18:03.418 --> 01:18:05.835
Getting voted to be
on Food Network.

1475
01:18:05.919 --> 01:18:07.627
My daughter and my wife

1476
01:18:07.710 --> 01:18:10.335
basically run
the day-to-day operations now.

1477
01:18:10.418 --> 01:18:12.669
This definitely make me
feel good

1478
01:18:12.752 --> 01:18:14.919
that my kids came to live
with me.

1479
01:18:16.377 --> 01:18:18.210
I'm glad I came back home

1480
01:18:18.293 --> 01:18:22.543
to experience this and
to help build Charleston up.

1481
01:18:38.293 --> 01:18:42.293
- We were moving up from
California to the Northwest...

1482
01:18:43.794 --> 01:18:48.043
And heard Bend
was a gorgeous town...

1483
01:18:48.126 --> 01:18:49.335
in the High Desert.

1484
01:18:49.418 --> 01:18:52.043
which always has this
really evocative sense to it.

1485
01:18:52.126 --> 01:18:53.418
the High Desert.

1486
01:18:56.835 --> 01:19:00.043
- Bend. Oregon. is the
culmination of this journey

1487
01:19:00.126 --> 01:19:04.418
because it's a town that found
its way back from failure.

1488
01:19:04.502 --> 01:19:06.710
- Bend was
a pretty depressed place.

1489
01:19:06.794 --> 01:19:08.210
Talking about the '80s

1490
01:19:08.293 --> 01:19:10.543
right after the logging boom
had sort of ended.

1491
01:19:10.627 --> 01:19:13.168
it was just sort of
a tough time.

1492
01:19:13.251 --> 01:19:15.835
- Bend was very much
a blue-collar town.

1493
01:19:15.919 --> 01:19:21.085
It has become a four-season
tourist destination.

1494
01:19:21.168 --> 01:19:24.085
- People had heard of it
being a vibrant community.

1495
01:19:24.168 --> 01:19:27.710
Next thing you know.
we're gonna move here.

1496
01:19:27.794 --> 01:19:30.293
- The people who've come
in the last ten years

1497
01:19:30.377 --> 01:19:34.210
don't understand
what it was like 30 years ago.

1498
01:19:34.293 --> 01:19:36.919
This was a small.
depressed timber town

1499
01:19:37.001 --> 01:19:40.085
that had to reach bottom.

1500
01:19:40.168 --> 01:19:42.001
But we were committed.

1501
01:19:50.669 --> 01:19:52.585
- I was an actress in LA.
and it was great.

1502
01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:55.085
But we wanted to raise
our family up here.

1503
01:19:55.168 --> 01:19:57.752
so I am actually gonna go back
to school

1504
01:19:57.835 --> 01:20:00.168
and get my master's
and be a school counselor.

1505
01:20:00.251 --> 01:20:03.293
- My company's based in Austin.
but I can do most my job here.

1506
01:20:03.377 --> 01:20:06.043
you know. through
video conference or whatnot.

1507
01:20:06.126 --> 01:20:08.460
- When I was in LA and sitting
in traffic on the 405

1508
01:20:08.543 --> 01:20:11.126
and I had to drop everything
to go for this audition

1509
01:20:11.210 --> 01:20:13.585
and. like.
missing my kids' play.

1510
01:20:13.669 --> 01:20:15.335
I'm like.
"What the--am I doing?"

1511
01:20:15.418 --> 01:20:16.293
You know?

1512
01:20:16.377 --> 01:20:17.502
And. like.
I probably won't get the job.

1513
01:20:17.585 --> 01:20:20.293
I didn't get the job.
And I'm like. "This is insane."

1514
01:20:20.377 --> 01:20:23.126
I want to just be present.

1515
01:20:28.877 --> 01:20:30.418
- This is one
of the best places

1516
01:20:30.502 --> 01:20:32.835
to bike and run and swim.

1517
01:20:32.919 --> 01:20:37.627
Because of that. there's
high demand to live here.

1518
01:20:37.710 --> 01:20:40.502
My wife was a professional
distance runner.

1519
01:20:40.585 --> 01:20:42.502
I was a professional
triathlete.

1520
01:20:42.585 --> 01:20:47.335
We started a company making
food products for ourselves.

1521
01:20:47.418 --> 01:20:51.293
Bend is a place where people
move because they want to.

1522
01:20:51.377 --> 01:20:54.043
It means that
you will even work in a job

1523
01:20:54.126 --> 01:20:55.710
that you're maybe less
fulfilled in

1524
01:20:55.794 --> 01:20:57.710
because you can
fulfill yourself

1525
01:20:57.794 --> 01:20:59.335
in the other aspects
of your life.

1526
01:20:59.418 --> 01:21:00.877
primarily in recreation.

1527
01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:02.460
There's
a general understanding

1528
01:21:02.543 --> 01:21:03.960
in the business community

1529
01:21:04.043 --> 01:21:05.960
that if it's a fresh-powder
day. your employees

1530
01:21:06.043 --> 01:21:07.960
probably aren't going to be in
until 11:00 or 12:00.

1531
01:21:08.043 --> 01:21:10.877
And we support that.

1532
01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:12.085
- Yeah!

1533
01:21:12.168 --> 01:21:13.877
- It's just a little bit
different priority system.

1534
01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:15.710
value system. I think.

1535
01:21:15.794 --> 01:21:16.710
- You got that!

1536
01:21:16.794 --> 01:21:18.335
- That's part of why
we live here.

1537
01:21:18.418 --> 01:21:19.710
- Yee-haw!

1538
01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:23.877
- Bend has over 20 brewpubs

1539
01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:26.168
and is the home
of Deschutes beer.

1540
01:21:26.251 --> 01:21:29.251
After first-hand research
all over the country.

1541
01:21:29.335 --> 01:21:32.377
we've determined that the
number of breweries in a town

1542
01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:35.502
is a great indicator
of how it's doing overall.

1543
01:21:41.627 --> 01:21:44.710
- I was voted most likely
to succeed in high school.

1544
01:21:44.794 --> 01:21:46.543
and that's still--
that still is gonna happen.

1545
01:21:47.835 --> 01:21:49.210
Here we go.

1546
01:21:49.293 --> 01:21:51.585
- Work it. work it.
- Work it. work it.

1547
01:21:51.669 --> 01:21:55.460
In Bend. freelance can be
really ups and downs.

1548
01:21:56.960 --> 01:22:02.543
My dad moved to Bend in 1962.

1549
01:22:02.627 --> 01:22:06.752
And he worked for
Brooks-Scanlon. the sawmill.

1550
01:22:06.835 --> 01:22:10.251
- And so the Bend of the 1960s
when you came here.

1551
01:22:10.335 --> 01:22:12.960
what was it like?
- It was just a mill town.

1552
01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:19.460
And the Brooks-Scanlon Lumber
Company was a huge operation.

1553
01:22:19.543 --> 01:22:20.877
- Like West Virginia.

1554
01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:24.710
Oregon's economy
always depended on one thing.

1555
01:22:24.794 --> 01:22:27.251
In West Virginia. it was coal.

1556
01:22:27.335 --> 01:22:31.126
In Oregon. it was trees.

1557
01:22:31.210 --> 01:22:34.418
But in the 1980s.
the timber industry crashed.

1558
01:22:34.502 --> 01:22:36.585
and sawmills closed.

1559
01:22:36.669 --> 01:22:40.418
Bend suddenly had the highest
unemployment in the country.

1560
01:22:40.502 --> 01:22:42.335
- It was pretty staggering.

1561
01:22:42.418 --> 01:22:44.251
We had a lot of mill workers

1562
01:22:44.335 --> 01:22:47.794
that had a lot of skills
and nowhere to go.

1563
01:22:47.877 --> 01:22:51.460
It was really hard
on most people.

1564
01:22:51.543 --> 01:22:54.168
- Downtown Bend
was kind of boarded up.

1565
01:22:54.251 --> 01:22:55.710
- There was a saying in Bend.
you know.

1566
01:22:55.794 --> 01:22:57.293
"The last one to leave
downtown.

1567
01:22:57.377 --> 01:22:59.001
turn out the lights."

1568
01:22:59.085 --> 01:23:02.251
- Bend was pretty empty
when I was a kid.

1569
01:23:02.335 --> 01:23:05.669
I think that Bend was really
kind of grasping

1570
01:23:05.752 --> 01:23:08.168
for what was gonna be next.

1571
01:23:08.251 --> 01:23:10.585
My friends. whose parents were
in other industries.

1572
01:23:10.669 --> 01:23:11.627
there was hope.

1573
01:23:11.710 --> 01:23:13.960
More tourism was starting
to happen.

1574
01:23:14.043 --> 01:23:15.669
Bend has always had
Mount Bachelor to rely on.

1575
01:23:15.752 --> 01:23:18.001
and people were
still coming to ski.

1576
01:23:18.085 --> 01:23:21.585
- We began to realize a lot
of people were moving here

1577
01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:23.126
who had come here on vacation.

1578
01:23:23.210 --> 01:23:25.126
They may have come to ski.

1579
01:23:25.210 --> 01:23:28.043
But then they said. "You know.
this is a pretty nice town."

1580
01:23:28.126 --> 01:23:31.168
- Mike Hollern was also
at Brooks-Scanlon.

1581
01:23:31.251 --> 01:23:34.001
He saw that the land where
they once grew timber

1582
01:23:34.085 --> 01:23:38.126
could be used
to build communities.

1583
01:23:38.210 --> 01:23:41.043
They created a series
of planned neighborhoods

1584
01:23:41.126 --> 01:23:43.085
designed to encourage
a social life.

1585
01:23:43.168 --> 01:23:45.543
with front porches
and back alleys.

1586
01:23:49.043 --> 01:23:51.543
Stores and schools are close
to houses.

1587
01:23:51.627 --> 01:23:53.710
- The reason that people like
living on the Westside of Bend

1588
01:23:53.794 --> 01:23:56.085
is that you can walk
everywhere you want to go.

1589
01:23:56.168 --> 01:23:57.168
That's not always available

1590
01:23:57.251 --> 01:23:59.377
in the newer. suburban model
of development.

1591
01:24:02.043 --> 01:24:03.835
- As the mills were
shutting down.

1592
01:24:03.919 --> 01:24:06.669
a plan to turn them
into a retail district

1593
01:24:06.752 --> 01:24:09.001
was led by Bill Smith.

1594
01:24:09.085 --> 01:24:12.543
- When the sawmill closed.
they had 30 people employed.

1595
01:24:14.126 --> 01:24:16.752
Now there's 4.000 people
employed in the area.

1596
01:24:26.502 --> 01:24:30.710
- Bend has become this haven
for remote workers

1597
01:24:30.794 --> 01:24:34.877
that work for companies
outside of Oregon.

1598
01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:36.210
I tell entrepreneurs.

1599
01:24:36.293 --> 01:24:39.251
"You can build your business
anywhere today."

1600
01:24:39.335 --> 01:24:41.669
Technology allows that.

1601
01:24:41.752 --> 01:24:43.293
Capital and your customers

1602
01:24:43.377 --> 01:24:45.085
don't care
where you're located.

1603
01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:59.251
- Deschutes County has
about 6.000 people a year

1604
01:24:59.335 --> 01:25:01.251
moving into the county.

1605
01:25:01.335 --> 01:25:03.585
So many new people
are moving in.

1606
01:25:03.669 --> 01:25:04.919
A lot of times. this is

1607
01:25:05.001 --> 01:25:06.085
the first place people will go

1608
01:25:06.168 --> 01:25:07.251
because they don't know

1609
01:25:07.335 --> 01:25:08.835
anybody else in the community

1610
01:25:08.919 --> 01:25:12.210
and they need to start making
some social connections.

1611
01:25:13.835 --> 01:25:17.251
Last night. we had a program
out at a brewery in here town

1612
01:25:17.335 --> 01:25:19.210
with author Rich Benjamin.

1613
01:25:20.460 --> 01:25:23.627
- I've written a book called
"Searching for Whitopia."

1614
01:25:23.710 --> 01:25:25.877
How do I define a whitopia?

1615
01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:28.960
That it is at least 85% white.

1616
01:25:29.043 --> 01:25:33.460
the majority of that growth
has been from white residents.

1617
01:25:33.543 --> 01:25:36.126
- Bend has more than 90%
white people.

1618
01:25:36.210 --> 01:25:37.919
Why is that happening?

1619
01:25:38.001 --> 01:25:40.085
- About white-on-white
gentrification.

1620
01:25:40.168 --> 01:25:42.293
- Last night was
a really great conversation

1621
01:25:42.377 --> 01:25:45.126
for how we can embrace
diversity.

1622
01:25:45.210 --> 01:25:47.126
How do we make this
a welcoming place

1623
01:25:47.210 --> 01:25:50.001
for people that are moving
into Deschutes County?

1624
01:25:53.168 --> 01:25:56.418
- If I could change anything
in Bend. it would be diversity.

1625
01:25:56.502 --> 01:25:59.251
- Tom Bedell and his stepson.
RA Beattie.

1626
01:25:59.335 --> 01:26:01.502
make custom guitars in Bend.

1627
01:26:09.710 --> 01:26:13.126
What would the naysayers say
is wrong with Bend?

1628
01:26:13.210 --> 01:26:14.835
- It's too big.

1629
01:26:14.919 --> 01:26:16.126
- Yeah. if they got here first.

1630
01:26:16.210 --> 01:26:18.293
they would now say
it's too big.

1631
01:26:18.377 --> 01:26:19.335
I wouldn't say that.

1632
01:26:19.418 --> 01:26:21.669
So there's always pressure.
you know?

1633
01:26:21.752 --> 01:26:24.168
Like. now that I live here.
Californians. stay home.

1634
01:26:24.251 --> 01:26:25.335
- Right?

1635
01:26:25.418 --> 01:26:27.627
- Yeah.
- But that's not fair.

1636
01:26:27.710 --> 01:26:28.835
- It's really hard to complain

1637
01:26:28.919 --> 01:26:31.669
about the people that
are making your economy work.

1638
01:26:31.752 --> 01:26:34.502
- Growth is fascinating
because communities think

1639
01:26:34.585 --> 01:26:37.877
that the secret
to their...

1640
01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:40.335
prosperity is growth.

1641
01:26:40.418 --> 01:26:41.460
And I believe

1642
01:26:41.543 --> 01:26:45.335
that our whole culture
is gonna go through a change

1643
01:26:45.418 --> 01:26:48.001
to where growth
isn't "the ideal thing."

1644
01:26:48.085 --> 01:26:51.335
If climate change comes
from growth. right?

1645
01:26:51.418 --> 01:26:54.001
Expanding economies
isn't necessarily

1646
01:26:54.085 --> 01:26:57.669
adding to the quality of life
of humans on this planet.

1647
01:26:57.752 --> 01:27:01.043
- The real question is.
how do you grow in a fashion

1648
01:27:01.126 --> 01:27:05.752
that doesn't create continued
reliance upon the automobile?

1649
01:27:05.835 --> 01:27:07.418
I have so many friends now

1650
01:27:07.502 --> 01:27:09.377
that are looking
to either move out of town

1651
01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:11.210
because they can no longer
afford to live here

1652
01:27:11.293 --> 01:27:13.418
or are forced to commute
30 minutes a day.

1653
01:27:13.502 --> 01:27:14.752
And so that sort of corrodes

1654
01:27:14.835 --> 01:27:16.377
a community.
you know. cohesiveness

1655
01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:17.877
because it
no longer allows people

1656
01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:19.418
to live in the communities
where they work.

1657
01:27:32.794 --> 01:27:36.502
- Who determines a town's
relationship to nature?

1658
01:27:38.669 --> 01:27:40.293
There are still places

1659
01:27:40.377 --> 01:27:43.293
where you can imagine
a world without people.

1660
01:27:46.293 --> 01:27:51.418
When Europeans arrived. they
carved out farms and ranches.

1661
01:27:51.502 --> 01:27:55.877
Small towns were places
to buy and sell goods.

1662
01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:58.293
But as the country
industrialized.

1663
01:27:58.377 --> 01:28:02.710
the landscape turned into
something unrecognizable...

1664
01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:08.543
Or these days.
all too recognizable

1665
01:28:08.627 --> 01:28:10.543
because the same strip malls.

1666
01:28:10.627 --> 01:28:14.543
box stores. and chain
restaurants are everywhere.

1667
01:28:26.710 --> 01:28:30.835
And when nature is erased.
how can you ever get it back?

1668
01:28:30.919 --> 01:28:33.418
It's a tense question in Bend.

1669
01:28:47.794 --> 01:28:50.293
- My name's Sky Sharp.
and what we do here

1670
01:28:50.377 --> 01:28:53.418
is we raise beef
in a good way.

1671
01:28:53.502 --> 01:28:56.335
and we sell it farm to table.

1672
01:28:59.543 --> 01:29:01.627
I chose this life
a long time ago

1673
01:29:01.710 --> 01:29:05.669
because it was just where
I felt right. you know?

1674
01:29:05.752 --> 01:29:08.126
My whole adult life.
I've been a cowboy.

1675
01:29:08.210 --> 01:29:12.001
Like. bunched cows
and rode horses.

1676
01:29:12.085 --> 01:29:16.502
I just ended up
really liking cows

1677
01:29:16.585 --> 01:29:18.710
more than I liked people.

1678
01:29:20.418 --> 01:29:24.377
My horses and my dogs.
we try to work as a unit.

1679
01:29:28.210 --> 01:29:29.835
In the five years
that we've been here.

1680
01:29:29.919 --> 01:29:31.085
it's growing so fast

1681
01:29:31.168 --> 01:29:35.669
as far as people moving
from California and wherever.

1682
01:29:35.752 --> 01:29:37.418
Lots of farms and ranches

1683
01:29:37.502 --> 01:29:41.293
getting turned
into subdivisions.

1684
01:29:41.377 --> 01:29:43.919
Doesn't feel like communities
see food producers

1685
01:29:44.001 --> 01:29:46.460
as necessity.

1686
01:29:47.794 --> 01:29:49.043
It's hard.

1687
01:29:49.126 --> 01:29:51.335
I met those cows
when they're born.

1688
01:29:51.418 --> 01:29:55.543
You know.
I witnessed their first steps.

1689
01:29:55.627 --> 01:29:59.543
And I also take away
their last breath. you know?

1690
01:29:59.627 --> 01:30:01.752
So it's emotionally tough.

1691
01:30:10.669 --> 01:30:13.752
I love watching the subtleties
of things

1692
01:30:13.835 --> 01:30:16.418
that always reminds me
as a human being

1693
01:30:16.502 --> 01:30:18.919
that I'm part
of something much bigger.

1694
01:30:21.293 --> 01:30:23.377
My whole life. I've felt
like I had a purpose.

1695
01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:25.585
and that purpose was
to be a shepherd

1696
01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:29.585
and a steward to nature.

1697
01:30:29.669 --> 01:30:31.960
That's what we try to do here.

1698
01:30:58.710 --> 01:31:00.251
- We started this project

1699
01:31:00.335 --> 01:31:03.710
in the wake
of a global financial crisis.

1700
01:31:03.794 --> 01:31:05.085
And as we finish.

1701
01:31:05.168 --> 01:31:07.585
the world is dealing
with upheavals

1702
01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:09.251
on a historic scale.

1703
01:31:12.210 --> 01:31:15.126
- The pandemic has transformed
just about everything.

1704
01:31:19.543 --> 01:31:22.126
And inequalities
in race and class

1705
01:31:22.210 --> 01:31:24.502
are now in everyone's sight.

1706
01:31:28.919 --> 01:31:30.293
- It's easy to forget

1707
01:31:30.377 --> 01:31:34.001
that our history is full
of convulsive moments.

1708
01:31:47.418 --> 01:31:51.085
Every town has had
its heartbreaks and setbacks.

1709
01:31:52.919 --> 01:31:56.502
And these days. every town
is dealing with new ones.

1710
01:31:59.877 --> 01:32:01.710
- On this journey. we've seen

1711
01:32:01.794 --> 01:32:05.001
how towns have pulled
themselves up in the past.

1712
01:32:05.085 --> 01:32:07.710
We can learn
from how they did it.

1713
01:32:09.835 --> 01:32:12.085
Recovery takes
working together.

1714
01:32:12.168 --> 01:32:14.960
It's harder
in polarized times.

1715
01:32:15.043 --> 01:32:17.919
but towns do it
by focusing on local issues

1716
01:32:18.001 --> 01:32:21.043
that are outside the divisions
of national politics.

1717
01:32:23.585 --> 01:32:25.001
- Each town has individuals

1718
01:32:25.085 --> 01:32:28.543
who feel a responsibility
to their community.

1719
01:32:28.627 --> 01:32:32.251
- We tried a lot
of different things with you.

1720
01:32:32.335 --> 01:32:33.752
Nobody gave up on you.

1721
01:32:33.835 --> 01:32:37.210
so we don't want you giving up
on yourself.

1722
01:32:37.293 --> 01:32:40.835
- Democracy has always
depended on leadership.

1723
01:32:40.919 --> 01:32:44.502
- The woman chief is powerful.
The women ruled.

1724
01:32:44.585 --> 01:32:47.210
I don't know
how it shifted to the men.

1725
01:32:47.293 --> 01:32:49.585
I hope these girls look at me
and say.

1726
01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:52.752
"I could be that
one of these days."

1727
01:32:52.835 --> 01:32:55.251
- Community colleges
help people start

1728
01:32:55.335 --> 01:32:57.210
and restart their lives.

1729
01:32:57.293 --> 01:32:59.835
- We take everyone.
We're open to everyone.

1730
01:32:59.919 --> 01:33:03.043
Everyone has
an opportunity here.

1731
01:33:03.126 --> 01:33:07.335
- Local newspapers and media
play a crucial role.

1732
01:33:07.418 --> 01:33:11.585
National news isn't gonna tell
you what matters in your town.

1733
01:33:11.669 --> 01:33:15.585
- Voters need journalists
at their city council meetings

1734
01:33:15.669 --> 01:33:16.877
and their school board
meetings.

1735
01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:18.919
This community
stepped up to say.

1736
01:33:19.001 --> 01:33:23.168
"We want you to stay here
and keep doing journalism."

1737
01:33:23.251 --> 01:33:25.585
- Public art
helps us understand

1738
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:28.085
where we've been
and where we're going.

1739
01:33:28.168 --> 01:33:32.585
especially when people
disagree on those things.

1740
01:33:32.669 --> 01:33:34.919
- If you're at a place
where there is no scene.

1741
01:33:35.001 --> 01:33:36.585
you make your own scene.

1742
01:33:36.669 --> 01:33:38.585
I'm the person dumb
or crazy enough

1743
01:33:38.669 --> 01:33:40.627
to put my money right here.

1744
01:33:40.710 --> 01:33:42.710
I'm going to do
contemporary art

1745
01:33:42.794 --> 01:33:44.126
in San Bernardino.

1746
01:33:46.502 --> 01:33:49.585
- Forward-looking towns take
on climate change

1747
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:51.585
and growth.

1748
01:33:51.669 --> 01:33:56.710
The pandemic reminds us that
humans aren't above nature.

1749
01:33:56.794 --> 01:33:58.335
We're part of it.

1750
01:34:05.418 --> 01:34:08.335
It seems like wherever we go.

1751
01:34:08.418 --> 01:34:12.585
people have a certain kind
of stubbornness.

1752
01:34:12.669 --> 01:34:15.669
Even when things are dark...

1753
01:34:17.710 --> 01:34:19.669
They're imagining
a better future.

1754
01:35:06.251 --> 01:35:07.335
- People would ask.

1755
01:35:07.418 --> 01:35:09.710
why am I spending
so much time on this?

1756
01:35:09.794 --> 01:35:13.001
Why am I not doing this
in a bigger city?

1757
01:35:13.085 --> 01:35:16.752
I found this quote
in "Julius Caesar"...

1758
01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:44.210
I always felt this way.

1759
01:35:44.293 --> 01:35:47.710
This is a place where.
actually. the tide's in.

1760
01:35:47.794 --> 01:35:49.418
and if you put your boats out

1761
01:35:49.502 --> 01:35:51.710
or if you put your ventures out
right now.

1762
01:35:51.794 --> 01:35:53.752
you know. we can make something
of ourselves.
