00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.008
Wait here.

4
00:02:39.952 --> 00:02:42.371
He told me to wait outside.

5
00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:50.337
Let's go.

6
00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:32.541
Wouldn't let me in. so...

7
00:05:36.545 --> 00:05:38.547
Yeah. they should've let me in.

8
00:05:38.547 --> 00:05:40.883
Why are you two still breathing?

9
00:05:40.883 --> 00:05:42.467
We arrived after...

10
00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:54.229
So I make sure I understand.

11
00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:57.900
You came here.

12
00:05:58.609 --> 00:05:59.985
Alone.

13
00:06:00.611 --> 00:06:03.739
To this vineyard. in Sicily.

14
00:06:05.282 --> 00:06:06.241
For?

15
00:06:06.742 --> 00:06:07.576
You.

16
00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:10.621
You know who I am. then?

17
00:06:10.621 --> 00:06:12.247
I know what you are.

18
00:06:15.167 --> 00:06:16.752
Yet you came anyway.

19
00:06:20.923 --> 00:06:21.757
Why?

20
00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:28.055
You took something that didn't
belong to you. I'm here to take it back.

21
00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:32.601
How did you find me?

22
00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:35.521
No one ever has.

23
00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:41.235
Okay.

24
00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:44.530
Okay.

25
00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:47.658
Here you are.

26
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.829
Except you're a few meters short...

27
00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:56.667
of what you came for.

28
00:07:01.797 --> 00:07:04.550
We all end up where we're supposed to be.

29
00:07:05.008 --> 00:07:06.176
Which means...

30
00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:10.597
your man to my left. finger on the trigger
but he's a foot too close.

31
00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:13.058
which renders your man
to my right dead already.

32
00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:16.270
He just doesn't know it yet.
I feel sorry for his family.

33
00:07:17.563 --> 00:07:18.939
Nine seconds.

34
00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:24.778
That's what you have to decide your fate.

35
00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:26.780
Nine seconds.

36
00:09:28.819 --> 00:09:31.196
Stop. stop. stop.

37
00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:36.243
It's only you?

38
00:09:37.661 --> 00:09:39.496
Okay. good.

39
00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:42.749
Stay in the truck. son.

40
00:09:44.376 --> 00:09:45.377
Okay?

41
00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:49.798
Okay.

42
00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:23.952
The blood pressure is very low.
He wouldn't have made it to the hospital.

43
00:12:25.621 --> 00:12:26.872
He's about to go into shock.

44
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:34.505
Take a blanket and put it on his legs.

45
00:12:39.676 --> 00:12:41.178
Mind the light. Thank you.

46
00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.013
Thank you. That's good.

47
00:12:49.436 --> 00:12:50.395
- Gio.
- Yes.

48
00:12:50.854 --> 00:12:51.813
This man fell down.

49
00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.399
He didn't fall. They shot him.

50
00:12:54.942 --> 00:12:57.694
You brought me a man that fell down. Okay?

51
00:13:02.616 --> 00:13:04.576
- Clean his wound here.
- Yes.

52
00:13:15.212 --> 00:13:17.506
Lucky it was only a .22 caliber.

53
00:13:26.515 --> 00:13:28.267
Gio saved your life.

54
00:13:28.851 --> 00:13:30.352
So I ask...

55
00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:32.604
did he save a good man?

56
00:13:33.105 --> 00:13:34.189
Or a bad man?

57
00:13:38.443 --> 00:13:40.153
I don't know. <i>Non lo so.</i>

58
00:13:41.238 --> 00:13:42.364
Where are you headed?

59
00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:44.408
Home.

60
00:13:45.284 --> 00:13:46.326
<i>No. no.</i>

61
00:13:46.994 --> 00:13:47.995
<i>SÃ¬.</i>

62
00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:50.455
<i>No. no. no.</i>

63
00:13:50.455 --> 00:13:52.374
Not so fast now.

64
00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:53.959
<i>No. No. no.</i>

65
00:13:55.377 --> 00:13:57.129
Your wound...

66
00:13:57.129 --> 00:13:59.423
it needs time to heal.

67
00:14:00.549 --> 00:14:01.633
Okay.

68
00:14:06.013 --> 00:14:08.557
Will the bad men come looking for you?

69
00:14:10.142 --> 00:14:11.143
No.

70
00:14:57.397 --> 00:14:59.900
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

71
00:15:04.488 --> 00:15:05.822
I made you some soup.

72
00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.037
- Thank you.
- Enzo.

73
00:15:13.121 --> 00:15:15.207
- Thank you. Enzo.
- What's your name?

74
00:15:18.794 --> 00:15:20.045
Roberto.

75
00:15:21.213 --> 00:15:22.297
Roberto.

76
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:23.841
Okay.

77
00:15:30.806 --> 00:15:32.432
Where am I?

78
00:15:33.809 --> 00:15:35.477
Where you're supposed to be.

79
00:15:37.688 --> 00:15:38.522
Okay.

80
00:16:20.022 --> 00:16:21.064
Roberto.

81
00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:23.775
Enzo.

82
00:16:23.775 --> 00:16:26.653
Good thing I kept my father's cane.

83
00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:32.910
- Do you mind?
- Yeah.

84
00:16:34.912 --> 00:16:35.913
Good.

85
00:16:42.044 --> 00:16:43.170
How long I...

86
00:16:43.712 --> 00:16:45.047
Three days today.

87
00:16:48.425 --> 00:16:49.635
Altamonte.

88
00:16:50.594 --> 00:16:52.804
Small. but <i>simpatico</i>.

89
00:16:55.766 --> 00:16:57.309
Go slowly. okay?

90
00:17:04.775 --> 00:17:06.443
Roberto. to the left.

91
00:17:06.443 --> 00:17:08.737
the steps. the piazza.

92
00:18:08.046 --> 00:18:10.215
Khalid. bring me the red snappers.

93
00:18:10.215 --> 00:18:11.341
Coming.

94
00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:25.874
Good morning.

95
00:19:27.209 --> 00:19:28.627
Tea. <i>per favore</i>.

96
00:19:28.627 --> 00:19:29.545
A tea?

97
00:19:32.464 --> 00:19:33.799
The tea bag.

98
00:19:33.799 --> 00:19:35.050
Tea bag.

99
00:19:35.759 --> 00:19:37.010
I'll bring it right away.

100
00:19:37.928 --> 00:19:39.596
Yes. Thank you.

101
00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:54.319
I'm sorry.
but tea is for old ladies and Englishmen.

102
00:20:21.763 --> 00:20:22.848
Good morning.

103
00:20:23.348 --> 00:20:24.892
I'm Giorgio Bonucci. I'm--

104
00:20:24.892 --> 00:20:27.269
Gio. Gio. Gio.

105
00:20:28.145 --> 00:20:29.521
This is my daughter Gabby.

106
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:32.316
Good morning. Aminah.

107
00:20:32.983 --> 00:20:35.360
Gabby. I have
a small something for you. Come.

108
00:20:38.822 --> 00:20:39.823
So...

109
00:20:43.869 --> 00:20:46.079
- You've had a very bad...
- Fall.

110
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:47.956
- Fall.
- Yes.

111
00:20:50.834 --> 00:20:52.628
Dr. Enzo's a very good doctor.

112
00:20:53.587 --> 00:20:56.757
He brought me to this world.
My parents too.

113
00:20:57.424 --> 00:20:58.425
Almost everybody here.

114
00:21:03.514 --> 00:21:04.556
These are good people.

115
00:21:05.474 --> 00:21:06.517
I understand.

116
00:21:09.102 --> 00:21:11.313
I parked your car behind the station.

117
00:21:13.232 --> 00:21:14.733
For when you feel better.

118
00:21:17.277 --> 00:21:18.987
I didn't look in your bags.

119
00:21:23.242 --> 00:21:24.243
Thank you.

120
00:22:10.956 --> 00:22:11.957
Collins.

121
00:22:14.835 --> 00:22:16.295
<i>Vineyard in Sicily.</i>

122
00:22:18.297 --> 00:22:20.632
<i>Six-point-two miles south of--</i>

123
00:22:20.632 --> 00:22:21.717
Who is this?

124
00:22:22.801 --> 00:22:24.052
<i>Concerned citizen.</i>

125
00:22:40.402 --> 00:22:41.403
Collins.

126
00:22:42.362 --> 00:22:47.075
<i>Yeah. Cantina Arriana Vineyards.
just south of Palermo.</i>

127
00:22:47.075 --> 00:22:48.327
Who is this?

128
00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:51.663
<i>Crates imported from Middle East.</i>

129
00:22:51.663 --> 00:22:53.081
Syria. by the looks of it.

130
00:22:53.081 --> 00:22:55.751
Yeah. what is it?
Fruits? Tree nuts? Spices?

131
00:22:55.751 --> 00:22:57.920
I'm sorry.
but there's nothing unusual about that.

132
00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.004
<i>Wine.</i>

133
00:23:00.005 --> 00:23:01.006
Wine?

134
00:23:01.006 --> 00:23:02.758
Wine. 55 crates of it.

135
00:23:03.509 --> 00:23:06.470
Why is a Sicilian winery
importing wine from Syria?

136
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:11.183
- Guess I got the right number after all.
- Look. buddy. I--

137
00:23:11.183 --> 00:23:14.561
Some kind of a repackaging operation.
by the looks of it.

138
00:23:14.561 --> 00:23:16.396
You're gonna need
a physical access team.

139
00:23:16.396 --> 00:23:17.981
You know all this how?

140
00:23:18.649 --> 00:23:21.568
Just passing through. I thought
it might be of interest to you people.

141
00:23:22.194 --> 00:23:23.320
"You people"?

142
00:23:24.321 --> 00:23:25.656
You know who you're calling?

143
00:23:25.656 --> 00:23:28.075
The CIA Financial Operations Group.

144
00:23:28.075 --> 00:23:30.285
You track suspect money sources. right?

145
00:23:30.994 --> 00:23:32.663
Yeah. that's right. Hold on.

146
00:23:33.664 --> 00:23:35.624
Let me get something
to write this down with.

147
00:23:35.624 --> 00:23:39.002
No need for that. Everything on this line
is recorded anyway. right?

148
00:23:40.003 --> 00:23:41.004
<i>Buddy?</i>

149
00:23:55.477 --> 00:23:59.022
Collins.
Yeah. I have a potential op situation.

150
00:25:29.821 --> 00:25:31.031
Go slowly.

151
00:26:20.414 --> 00:26:24.084
<i>One day someone does something
unspeakable to someone else.</i>

152
00:26:24.084 --> 00:26:27.004
<i>and you do something about it
'cause you can.</i>

153
00:26:27.004 --> 00:26:28.589
Because it's who you are?

154
00:26:29.673 --> 00:26:31.049
Who you've always been?

155
00:27:07.127 --> 00:27:09.254
Dad. Mum is calling you from the kitchen.

156
00:27:15.344 --> 00:27:16.803
Your salad.

157
00:27:17.679 --> 00:27:18.555
Enjoy it.

158
00:27:59.596 --> 00:28:00.472
My name is Aminah.

159
00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:02.891
Roberto.

160
00:28:02.891 --> 00:28:04.017
Nice to meet you.

161
00:28:05.435 --> 00:28:06.478
Enjoy your tea.

162
00:28:17.781 --> 00:28:18.866
Excuse me. sir.

163
00:28:18.866 --> 00:28:20.450
This shirt would look good on you!

164
00:28:21.493 --> 00:28:22.703
This shirt is perfect.

165
00:28:22.703 --> 00:28:23.829
It's your color.

166
00:28:23.829 --> 00:28:25.122
With these pants.

167
00:28:25.122 --> 00:28:26.164
What do you think?

168
00:28:26.164 --> 00:28:27.124
Perfect outfit.

169
00:28:29.626 --> 00:28:32.087
Okay. only one shirt.
but with the right pants.

170
00:28:32.087 --> 00:28:33.088
Only one for me.

171
00:28:33.088 --> 00:28:35.465
And the hat.
because it matches the shirt.

172
00:28:35.465 --> 00:28:36.800
They are the same color.

173
00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:37.885
Perfect.

174
00:28:39.595 --> 00:28:40.596
Okay?

175
00:28:40.596 --> 00:28:41.680
Discount?

176
00:29:06.246 --> 00:29:10.125
Marco. I needed to repair the freezer.
I have no business without it.

177
00:29:10.125 --> 00:29:12.127
And what do I care about the freezer?

178
00:29:12.127 --> 00:29:14.505
I'll pay you next week. Don't worry.

179
00:29:15.547 --> 00:29:17.424
Come on. Angelo. give me the money.

180
00:29:18.675 --> 00:29:20.010
How you doing. Khalid?

181
00:29:25.599 --> 00:29:27.935
Angelo. everyone must pay.

182
00:29:28.685 --> 00:29:30.229
We know each other
from a long time. right?

183
00:29:44.284 --> 00:29:46.078
See you next week.

184
00:29:46.078 --> 00:29:48.872
There is no problem. Angelo.
Really no problem.

185
00:29:54.753 --> 00:29:56.588
Calm down. Good boy.

186
00:29:58.340 --> 00:29:59.383
Pull yourself together.

187
00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:14.982
Come on. let's go. Come on!

188
00:30:26.034 --> 00:30:27.452
Khalid. let's get back to work.

189
00:30:36.461 --> 00:30:37.421
Angelo!

190
00:30:38.046 --> 00:30:39.631
Next week.

191
00:30:40.257 --> 00:30:41.675
Don't piss me off.

192
00:32:08.887 --> 00:32:10.055
Wait here.

193
00:32:12.599 --> 00:32:13.892
Where's my brother?

194
00:32:13.892 --> 00:32:15.769
Upstairs dealing with something.

195
00:32:17.062 --> 00:32:19.898
These are the waivers. Sign them.

196
00:32:19.898 --> 00:32:22.359
You cannot throw people
out of their homes. Do you understand?

197
00:32:22.359 --> 00:32:24.611
These people don't know where to go.

198
00:32:25.612 --> 00:32:26.446
Lucia.

199
00:32:30.367 --> 00:32:31.785
Mr. Quaranta.

200
00:32:34.371 --> 00:32:37.833
We cannot sign these papers.

201
00:32:38.542 --> 00:32:39.376
Okay?

202
00:32:41.378 --> 00:32:43.046
A court will decide.

203
00:32:43.046 --> 00:32:48.051
And maybe you'll have
to find another building for your hotel.

204
00:32:49.178 --> 00:32:51.680
I really hope you understand.

205
00:32:52.514 --> 00:32:54.558
Thank you for your time.

206
00:33:21.293 --> 00:33:23.837
Got a new car?

207
00:33:23.837 --> 00:33:25.047
How's the new kid doing?

208
00:33:25.047 --> 00:33:27.090
Good. He listens to me.

209
00:33:28.258 --> 00:33:29.384
He'll be a good one.

210
00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:33.305
Get everyone out.

211
00:33:38.185 --> 00:33:39.061
So?

212
00:33:40.562 --> 00:33:43.482
- I look out for you. don't I?
- Yes.

213
00:33:43.482 --> 00:33:45.359
You're my brother and I love you.

214
00:33:45.359 --> 00:33:46.860
but don't piss me off.

215
00:33:47.611 --> 00:33:50.197
Make collections. Don't be loud about it.

216
00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:53.659
I have more important issues.

217
00:33:54.326 --> 00:33:57.204
Why don't you make me part
of these important things?

218
00:33:57.704 --> 00:33:59.331
These are big ones.

219
00:34:08.757 --> 00:34:10.175
Stay in your place.

220
00:34:12.302 --> 00:34:14.137
You do what you do.

221
00:34:15.222 --> 00:34:17.516
I have big plans for you.

222
00:34:17.516 --> 00:34:18.891
Really?

223
00:34:18.891 --> 00:34:20.351
Don't worry.

224
00:34:29.027 --> 00:34:30.070
Leave him there.

225
00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:32.072
for everyone to see.

226
00:34:34.157 --> 00:34:36.409
Quick! Come on. Move it.

227
00:34:37.159 --> 00:34:39.121
Quickly! Come on.

228
00:34:55.971 --> 00:34:57.973
Big football match in two days.

229
00:34:57.973 --> 00:35:00.434
When I was young man. I used to play.

230
00:35:00.434 --> 00:35:01.602
Were you any good?

231
00:35:01.602 --> 00:35:04.479
No. That's why I became a doctor.

232
00:35:06.607 --> 00:35:10.110
So I'm going to the market tomorrow.
Do you need anything?

233
00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:11.778
I go for you. What do you want?

234
00:35:11.778 --> 00:35:14.489
- No. No. you should rest.
- No. no. no. I go.

235
00:35:14.489 --> 00:35:18.160
No. You do a lot for me.
And I'm strong. Look.

236
00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.912
- No. come on.
- I am strong.

237
00:35:20.829 --> 00:35:22.122
What kind of fish you like?

238
00:35:22.122 --> 00:35:23.749
Fish? I like <i>triglie.</i>

239
00:35:23.749 --> 00:35:25.709
Okay. Okay.

240
00:35:25.709 --> 00:35:30.547
- One. Two. <i>Triglia.</i>
- Okay. Okay. You do it.

241
00:35:30.547 --> 00:35:31.715
Four.

242
00:35:32.549 --> 00:35:34.718
Okay. I go. <i>Grazie.</i>

243
00:35:36.428 --> 00:35:37.846
- Cheers.
- <i>Salute.</i>

244
00:35:37.846 --> 00:35:39.473
For grilled or for roast.

245
00:35:39.473 --> 00:35:41.225
- And this is...?
- <i>Sempre orata.</i>

246
00:35:41.225 --> 00:35:43.560
- <i>Dorade.</i>
- <i>Orata.</i> yes.

247
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:44.811
Oh. this is the one.

248
00:35:44.811 --> 00:35:46.355
<i>- Spigola.</i>
- That's the sea bass. right?

249
00:35:49.107 --> 00:35:50.108
And this one?

250
00:35:51.068 --> 00:35:53.820
<i>- Spigola</i> I know. Sea bass. right?
- Sea bass. <i>Perfetto.</i>

251
00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:55.906
<i>Due</i> sea bass. Fresh?

252
00:35:58.033 --> 00:35:59.201
You're not supposed to smell the fish.

253
00:36:00.118 --> 00:36:01.286
Look at the eyes.

254
00:36:01.954 --> 00:36:04.581
Eyes are bright. Not cloudy.

255
00:36:04.581 --> 00:36:06.458
Gills red or pink.

256
00:36:07.876 --> 00:36:08.794
She's right.

257
00:36:09.753 --> 00:36:12.130
I see Stefano finally sold that hat.

258
00:36:16.343 --> 00:36:17.386
What did she say?

259
00:36:18.011 --> 00:36:20.764
I like the hat. I like it.

260
00:36:20.764 --> 00:36:22.182
She said she liked it?

261
00:36:23.433 --> 00:36:25.143
- Two?
- How much is it?

262
00:36:25.143 --> 00:36:28.856
Today you don't have to pay.
You are a friend of Enzo. You don't pay.

263
00:36:28.856 --> 00:36:30.524
That I understand. I'm paying.

264
00:36:30.524 --> 00:36:32.442
No. You are a friend of Enzo.

265
00:36:32.442 --> 00:36:34.194
- What's your name?
- Angelo.

266
00:36:34.194 --> 00:36:35.821
Angelo. I'm paying.

267
00:36:35.821 --> 00:36:37.114
- No.
- Please.

268
00:36:37.656 --> 00:36:39.616
Enzo's friend. I can't let you pay.

269
00:36:39.616 --> 00:36:42.119
Next time. I promise I'll let you pay.

270
00:36:42.744 --> 00:36:44.663
Come on. Khalid. let's give him his fish.

271
00:36:45.831 --> 00:36:46.832
Thank you.

272
00:37:24.161 --> 00:37:25.204
Collins.

273
00:37:27.414 --> 00:37:29.291
Fenethylline hydrochloride.

274
00:37:29.291 --> 00:37:30.375
Shit.

275
00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:33.754
Synthetic amphetamine.
ISIS fighters use it.

276
00:37:33.754 --> 00:37:35.214
Amps them up for days.

277
00:37:35.964 --> 00:37:38.800
- That door. was that...?
- We had to blow it open.

278
00:37:39.593 --> 00:37:40.928
What else is in there?

279
00:37:40.928 --> 00:37:42.888
I'll show you. Follow me.

280
00:37:46.558 --> 00:37:47.809
How much in cash?

281
00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:52.731
Approximately 11 million. U.S.

282
00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:56.109
Cameras?

283
00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:58.737
They all went down at the same time.

284
00:37:58.737 --> 00:38:00.864
Precisely 18:16.

285
00:38:01.657 --> 00:38:02.908
What about prints?

286
00:38:03.825 --> 00:38:05.035
Only one set so far.

287
00:38:06.537 --> 00:38:07.579
No match.

288
00:38:07.579 --> 00:38:09.748
Multiple bodies. only one set of prints?

289
00:38:21.051 --> 00:38:22.052
<i>So?</i>

290
00:38:22.052 --> 00:38:25.514
Terrorists out of Syria
smuggling their jihad drug here.

291
00:38:25.514 --> 00:38:27.766
repackaged. shipped to the mainland?

292
00:38:27.766 --> 00:38:30.352
And from here
it's no longer international cargo.

293
00:38:30.352 --> 00:38:31.770
It's kind of genius.

294
00:38:33.355 --> 00:38:36.650
- That money in there. is that connected?
- No. that's something else.

295
00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:39.903
Money laundering. cybertheft.
That's not our problem. But this is.

296
00:38:40.487 --> 00:38:43.323
Some terrorist faction
that's not on our radar.

297
00:38:43.323 --> 00:38:45.117
bringing the contraband to this farm?

298
00:38:46.159 --> 00:38:49.079
- How'd you hear about this?
- Call in. Anonymous.

299
00:38:51.623 --> 00:38:52.624
We gotta find out.

300
00:38:52.624 --> 00:38:54.877
is this the first shipment.
fifth. twentieth?

301
00:38:54.877 --> 00:38:57.421
- It's the fourth.
- How?

302
00:38:57.421 --> 00:39:00.632
Past 18 months. this vineyard shipped
200 cases of wine a month.

303
00:39:00.632 --> 00:39:02.759
And three months ago.
they started shipping 500.

304
00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:06.013
- Fuck me.
- Checked the financials on my flight over.

305
00:39:06.889 --> 00:39:08.140
We're blind on this.

306
00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:10.058
We get behind. people get hurt.

307
00:39:11.518 --> 00:39:12.519
Keep me updated.

308
00:39:40.172 --> 00:39:41.215
- Good?
- Yeah.

309
00:39:41.798 --> 00:39:43.509
- Almost good to go.
- Okay.

310
00:39:45.219 --> 00:39:46.261
Enzo.

311
00:39:51.058 --> 00:39:53.018
What do you see when you look at me?

312
00:39:55.896 --> 00:39:59.399
I mean. when I come here.
you take care of me.

313
00:40:00.317 --> 00:40:02.069
You don't call an ambulance.

314
00:40:02.069 --> 00:40:05.614
You don't call police.
You don't call <i>carabinieri.</i>

315
00:40:07.074 --> 00:40:07.908
Why?

316
00:40:07.908 --> 00:40:09.618
Remember what I asked you?

317
00:40:09.618 --> 00:40:11.620
- When I first come.
- Yeah.

318
00:40:16.834 --> 00:40:20.671
Yeah. Yeah. Am I a good man
or a bad man. you asked me.

319
00:40:21.839 --> 00:40:23.257
And you said you didn't know.

320
00:40:25.259 --> 00:40:26.260
I don't know.

321
00:40:27.761 --> 00:40:29.721
Only a good man would have said that.

322
00:41:23.442 --> 00:41:24.651
Brother.

323
00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:27.112
Been praying?

324
00:41:27.696 --> 00:41:29.364
I don't think God is listening.

325
00:41:29.781 --> 00:41:30.824
What's up?

326
00:41:31.617 --> 00:41:35.120
It's time. little brother.
to help me with bigger issues.

327
00:41:36.371 --> 00:41:41.043
I need you to put more pressure
on this town. these people.

328
00:41:42.044 --> 00:41:45.923
We have big plans for Altamonte.
resorts. hotels. casinos.

329
00:41:47.466 --> 00:41:49.176
You know what's to be done.

330
00:41:49.927 --> 00:41:52.221
Sure. Vincent.

331
00:41:55.265 --> 00:41:58.018
This entire coast will be ours soon.

332
00:41:59.102 --> 00:42:00.646
All of it.

333
00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:44.731
Aminah!

334
00:42:48.944 --> 00:42:50.529
No. Carmela! No!

335
00:42:57.119 --> 00:42:58.370
Angelo. no. no. no. no!

336
00:43:31.904 --> 00:43:32.779
Calm. calm.

337
00:43:33.947 --> 00:43:36.491
Calm down. Angelo. We're here to help you.

338
00:43:40.204 --> 00:43:44.082
They destroyed all we have.

339
00:45:06.915 --> 00:45:07.875
Hello. good morning.

340
00:45:08.584 --> 00:45:10.961
Marshal Bonucci. Altamonte Carabinieri.

341
00:45:13.881 --> 00:45:16.175
I need information...

342
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:19.261
on the owner of a van...

343
00:45:19.761 --> 00:45:20.721
Ford...

344
00:45:22.931 --> 00:45:24.641
blue or black.

345
00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:26.894
Suspicion of arson.

346
00:45:48.373 --> 00:45:49.875
Why do you do that?

347
00:45:52.669 --> 00:45:54.922
<i>- Scusi?</i>
- Why do you do that?

348
00:46:00.928 --> 00:46:01.929
Habit.

349
00:46:03.639 --> 00:46:04.640
I'm neat.

350
00:46:06.308 --> 00:46:07.309
Neat.

351
00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:09.311
And tell me...

352
00:46:09.937 --> 00:46:11.063
who cooks for you?

353
00:46:11.813 --> 00:46:12.814
I'm sorry?

354
00:46:13.565 --> 00:46:14.775
Who cooks for you?

355
00:46:16.818 --> 00:46:17.819
Here? Now?

356
00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:20.030
Home. In America.

357
00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:21.657
Who prepares your meals?

358
00:46:22.658 --> 00:46:23.659
I do.

359
00:46:24.952 --> 00:46:27.120
And what is your favorite dish?

360
00:46:30.999 --> 00:46:32.417
Chili con carne.

361
00:46:33.627 --> 00:46:35.879
- No? Okay. spaghetti.
- No. No. no.

362
00:46:35.879 --> 00:46:37.130
Ooh. okay. <i>Buono.</i>

363
00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:39.550
Con carne.

364
00:46:40.467 --> 00:46:41.677
Okay. okay.

365
00:46:44.513 --> 00:46:47.891
I would love to show you
the real food of Altamonte.

366
00:46:48.934 --> 00:46:50.310
Would you come with me?

367
00:46:55.399 --> 00:46:57.192
- Yes.
- Okay.

368
00:46:58.443 --> 00:46:59.945
- One condition.
- Yes.

369
00:47:00.654 --> 00:47:02.114
You wear your new hat.

370
00:47:02.948 --> 00:47:03.949
Okay.

371
00:47:05.951 --> 00:47:07.077
Don't go anywhere.

372
00:47:12.666 --> 00:47:14.334
How long have you owned the cafe?

373
00:47:15.419 --> 00:47:18.505
Twenty years.
It was my parents' first shop.

374
00:47:41.028 --> 00:47:42.905
We got something. Okay.

375
00:47:51.121 --> 00:47:52.247
What is it?

376
00:47:52.247 --> 00:47:54.166
This is kebab. This is...

377
00:47:55.876 --> 00:47:57.211
We'll have this next time.

378
00:48:58.272 --> 00:49:00.107
Good for tea.

379
00:49:05.028 --> 00:49:06.822
They see you as one of us now.

380
00:49:29.845 --> 00:49:30.846
Thank you.

381
00:49:39.396 --> 00:49:41.231
You know...

382
00:49:42.816 --> 00:49:48.071
I could turn and face you straight on
if you want to get a better photograph.

383
00:49:49.823 --> 00:49:52.367
Five. four. three...

384
00:49:52.951 --> 00:49:54.203
two. one.

385
00:49:58.040 --> 00:49:59.541
You don't look like you sound.

386
00:49:59.541 --> 00:50:00.626
You do.

387
00:50:03.712 --> 00:50:04.713
And you're welcome.

388
00:50:09.301 --> 00:50:10.302
For what?

389
00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:13.597
The tip. Guessing it led to something.

390
00:50:17.601 --> 00:50:18.602
Who are you?

391
00:50:19.728 --> 00:50:21.813
What were you doing
on that farm in Sicily?

392
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:26.068
Even better. a farm that bundles
methamphetamine-based narcotics.

393
00:50:26.068 --> 00:50:28.904
- Told you on the phone. just a guy--
- Passing through.

394
00:50:28.904 --> 00:50:29.988
That's right.

395
00:50:31.323 --> 00:50:32.866
You don't wanna play games with me.

396
00:50:34.117 --> 00:50:35.369
Just having my tea.

397
00:50:37.955 --> 00:50:38.997
Who do you work for?

398
00:50:39.665 --> 00:50:40.666
I'm retired.

399
00:50:41.333 --> 00:50:42.334
From?

400
00:50:44.628 --> 00:50:47.256
I can just take you in.
and we can do this at our office.

401
00:50:48.257 --> 00:50:50.801
You need jurisdictional approval for that.

402
00:50:50.801 --> 00:50:52.010
Unless you...

403
00:50:53.387 --> 00:50:55.055
wanna take me to a black site.

404
00:50:55.806 --> 00:50:56.807
Torture me.

405
00:50:56.807 --> 00:50:59.726
Says the man
who knew which agency line to call.

406
00:51:00.811 --> 00:51:01.895
Where'd you get that number?

407
00:51:01.895 --> 00:51:03.021
In the book.

408
00:51:03.856 --> 00:51:05.774
- What book?
- Little black book.

409
00:51:08.235 --> 00:51:09.444
How'd you know I was me?

410
00:51:11.530 --> 00:51:14.533
You're reading a tour guide for Rome.
We're in Altamonte.

411
00:51:14.533 --> 00:51:16.076
And your voice.

412
00:51:16.076 --> 00:51:17.619
What about it?

413
00:51:17.619 --> 00:51:19.246
The way you pronounce your M's.

414
00:51:19.246 --> 00:51:22.583
it's a dry. sandpapery sound.

415
00:51:22.583 --> 00:51:25.002
- I'll work on that.
- You should.

416
00:51:27.588 --> 00:51:30.174
Police found multiple dead bodies
on that vineyard.

417
00:51:32.217 --> 00:51:34.136
Yep. Yep. yep.

418
00:51:34.636 --> 00:51:37.723
Drugs are a dangerous occupation.

419
00:51:42.686 --> 00:51:43.687
You kill 'em?

420
00:51:44.438 --> 00:51:46.481
Do I look like a guy who kills people?

421
00:51:46.481 --> 00:51:48.817
I'm warming to the possibility.

422
00:51:50.444 --> 00:51:51.528
Touchet.

423
00:51:53.447 --> 00:51:54.990
Like it or not.
you're a person of interest.

424
00:51:54.990 --> 00:51:56.617
I'm an interesting person.

425
00:51:59.203 --> 00:52:00.537
What else can you tell me?

426
00:52:01.288 --> 00:52:02.289
Nothing.

427
00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:05.167
And believe me. I wish I could.

428
00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:09.922
Not even a little curious?

429
00:52:09.922 --> 00:52:11.924
- About?
- How I found you?

430
00:52:11.924 --> 00:52:13.759
Oh. that's easy.

431
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:16.094
You took the same ferry crossing.

432
00:52:17.387 --> 00:52:20.390
You noticed the security cameras
on the terminal building.

433
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:24.520
You rewound two weeks.
saw the license plates for the VW.

434
00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:26.230
GPS gave you the location.

435
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:27.773
How am I doing so far?

436
00:52:27.773 --> 00:52:30.776
Next. you'll do
a deep search on the name.

437
00:52:32.319 --> 00:52:33.654
Already in the works.

438
00:52:33.654 --> 00:52:36.281
Good. good.
That should raise your antenna.

439
00:52:37.658 --> 00:52:38.659
Why is that?

440
00:52:39.868 --> 00:52:42.579
I...don't... want...

441
00:52:42.579 --> 00:52:44.998
to... spoil it...

442
00:52:44.998 --> 00:52:47.376
for... you.

443
00:52:48.961 --> 00:52:50.087
Stick around.

444
00:52:51.755 --> 00:52:53.131
I'm just gettin' started.

445
00:52:55.551 --> 00:52:56.552
Me too.

446
00:52:59.888 --> 00:53:00.722
McCall.

447
00:53:01.807 --> 00:53:04.685
Very good. Two C's. two L's.

448
00:53:10.482 --> 00:53:11.358
Hello?

449
00:53:11.358 --> 00:53:13.277
<i>Your daughter left school early.</i>

450
00:53:14.611 --> 00:53:15.445
Who is this?

451
00:53:17.614 --> 00:53:18.574
Miss Marta.

452
00:53:19.157 --> 00:53:20.325
Have you seen Gabby?

453
00:53:20.325 --> 00:53:22.661
One of your officers picked her up
a while ago.

454
00:53:26.415 --> 00:53:27.499
Is everything all right?

455
00:53:39.678 --> 00:53:40.512
Chiara!

456
00:53:41.346 --> 00:53:42.181
Gabby!

457
00:53:44.641 --> 00:53:46.268
- Gabby!
- Gio!

458
00:54:01.116 --> 00:54:02.868
Carabiniere!

459
00:54:08.207 --> 00:54:09.583
Daddy. Daddy.

460
00:54:09.583 --> 00:54:12.211
He made a dumb mistake. Right?

461
00:54:12.211 --> 00:54:14.630
He made a call he wasn't supposed to.

462
00:54:16.590 --> 00:54:17.758
Stop!

463
00:54:18.675 --> 00:54:19.593
I beg you!

464
00:54:20.636 --> 00:54:22.971
You don't think we have friends there?

465
00:54:25.641 --> 00:54:28.894
Why do you need to be difficult.
Carabiniere?

466
00:54:29.436 --> 00:54:32.022
You know you shouldn't make trouble.

467
00:54:32.523 --> 00:54:33.357
No!

468
00:54:34.233 --> 00:54:36.777
- Viking! Grab the kid. quick.
- I'm eating.

469
00:54:36.777 --> 00:54:38.445
Who gives a shit you're eating.

470
00:54:38.445 --> 00:54:41.031
Sure. we should all wait
for the Viking to finish eating!

471
00:54:41.031 --> 00:54:42.407
Move it!

472
00:54:42.407 --> 00:54:44.493
This will teach you a lesson.

473
00:54:44.493 --> 00:54:45.869
Come on. bring her here.

474
00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:47.454
Look at me!

475
00:54:53.001 --> 00:54:56.046
Next time we'll hurt the little girl.

476
00:54:56.046 --> 00:54:57.881
Or we do something worse. Got it?

477
00:54:57.881 --> 00:54:59.550
We do something worse!

478
00:54:59.550 --> 00:55:01.635
- Let her go!
- You shut up!

479
00:55:08.892 --> 00:55:10.811
Good Carabiniere.

480
00:55:50.267 --> 00:55:51.268
<i>Dottore.</i>

481
00:55:53.437 --> 00:55:54.479
What happened to Gio?

482
00:55:55.439 --> 00:55:56.440
He fell.

483
00:55:59.234 --> 00:56:00.444
<i>What happens here...</i>

484
00:56:01.111 --> 00:56:02.738
happens in many towns.

485
00:56:02.738 --> 00:56:06.450
It's the Camorra. The Ndrangheta.

486
00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:07.784
What you call Mafia.

487
00:56:09.286 --> 00:56:10.662
They're like cancer.

488
00:56:11.788 --> 00:56:12.998
And like cancer...

489
00:56:13.749 --> 00:56:14.750
no cure.

490
00:56:59.044 --> 00:57:00.337
Should I call an ambulance?

491
00:57:08.846 --> 00:57:09.930
Pretty amazing.

492
00:57:10.514 --> 00:57:12.599
This church has been here
over a thousand years.

493
00:57:14.685 --> 00:57:16.770
I got a new guidebook.

494
00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:24.736
Says there's a fresco inside
depicting the Virgin performing a miracle.

495
00:57:25.863 --> 00:57:28.490
Saving some guy
from being unjustly hanged.

496
00:57:33.871 --> 00:57:34.955
You believe?

497
00:57:37.457 --> 00:57:39.168
- In what?
- In miracles.

498
00:57:42.254 --> 00:57:45.299
You mean a bunch of seemingly random acts
all falling into line

499
00:57:45.299 --> 00:57:46.842
at the right time and place?

500
00:57:48.886 --> 00:57:49.720
No.

501
00:57:55.184 --> 00:57:57.895
- So how'd the search go?
- Apparently. you're a ghost.

502
00:57:58.562 --> 00:58:00.063
Boo!

503
00:58:00.063 --> 00:58:01.648
Not afraid of ghosts.

504
00:58:02.566 --> 00:58:04.526
Or anything else I can see.

505
00:58:04.526 --> 00:58:06.278
Mr. Two C's and Two L's.

506
00:58:08.238 --> 00:58:10.616
Came here to tell you
you're not a person of interest.

507
00:58:10.616 --> 00:58:11.700
No?

508
00:58:12.993 --> 00:58:15.287
Just an interesting person.
for the time being.

509
00:58:18.498 --> 00:58:21.084
That Sicilian farmer is Lorenzo Vitale.

510
00:58:22.294 --> 00:58:25.088
Spent a decade
on Interpol's most wanted list.

511
00:58:25.088 --> 00:58:27.216
Ran a massive cyber empire.

512
00:58:27.216 --> 00:58:31.386
Siphoning money from offshore accounts.
government agencies. pension funds.

513
00:58:32.721 --> 00:58:35.516
Seems terrorists were using his farm
to smuggle drugs to the mainland.

514
00:58:37.643 --> 00:58:39.561
- So I'm off the hook?
- For now.

515
00:58:40.354 --> 00:58:43.065
I gotta ID a cell we didn't know existed.

516
00:58:44.441 --> 00:58:45.442
Got a plan?

517
00:58:46.693 --> 00:58:47.945
You think I'm new to this?

518
00:58:48.612 --> 00:58:51.907
Desk job two years.
Probably your first field tour.

519
00:58:52.783 --> 00:58:54.660
You'll be dealing with the locals now.

520
00:58:54.660 --> 00:58:56.912
- Point is?
- They have their own agendas.

521
00:58:56.912 --> 00:58:59.081
What they say is not always
what they mean.

522
00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:03.126
Aren't you just full of tips.

523
00:59:05.963 --> 00:59:06.964
Why me?

524
00:59:07.798 --> 00:59:09.216
The question is:

525
00:59:10.801 --> 00:59:11.802
Why Sicily?

526
00:59:11.802 --> 00:59:12.886
Why not...

527
00:59:13.637 --> 00:59:15.514
Elba or Sardinia?

528
00:59:15.514 --> 00:59:16.682
Excuse me?

529
00:59:19.601 --> 00:59:23.689
Why smuggle drugs into
the most secure port in the entire region?

530
00:59:24.606 --> 00:59:26.441
- That is a good one.
- Yeah.

531
00:59:27.359 --> 00:59:29.695
I'll circle back to you with the answer
when I'm done.

532
00:59:29.695 --> 00:59:30.904
I know you will.

533
00:59:35.409 --> 00:59:37.119
Then you can answer my question:

534
00:59:38.620 --> 00:59:39.621
Why me?

535
01:00:00.601 --> 01:00:01.518
Hi. Marshal.

536
01:00:02.269 --> 01:00:03.520
How are you?

537
01:00:07.482 --> 01:00:09.318
What a pretty girl you are.

538
01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:11.069
Remember me?

539
01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:16.033
How's your head. Marshal? Does it hurt?

540
01:00:20.996 --> 01:00:22.748
Don't worry. okay?

541
01:00:26.668 --> 01:00:28.587
Marshal. listen.

542
01:00:28.587 --> 01:00:30.839
I need a favor from you.

543
01:00:32.549 --> 01:00:34.510
I need you to go to the Somalis...

544
01:00:35.135 --> 01:00:37.304
and ask them for their boats.

545
01:00:37.804 --> 01:00:39.056
Can you do that?

546
01:00:42.476 --> 01:00:43.894
Sure. you can do that.

547
01:00:43.894 --> 01:00:47.314
You're my message boy now. Marshal.
Bravo. Marshal!

548
01:01:15.259 --> 01:01:17.761
You like being in other people's business.

549
01:01:19.847 --> 01:01:23.392
Trying very hard not to be.
but you make it very challenging for me.

550
01:01:25.853 --> 01:01:28.730
You should stay out of things
that are not your concern.

551
01:01:30.023 --> 01:01:31.608
It's bad for you.

552
01:01:32.526 --> 01:01:34.945
Lord knows I'm allergic to bad things.

553
01:01:39.449 --> 01:01:40.492
You know...

554
01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:44.580
I believe that everything in life...

555
01:01:45.539 --> 01:01:46.707
is about timing.

556
01:01:46.707 --> 01:01:48.417
Now. unfortunately for you...

557
01:01:49.126 --> 01:01:50.586
yours isn't very good.

558
01:01:53.797 --> 01:01:57.843
Three weeks ago we wouldn't be having
this conversation. but I'm here now.

559
01:01:59.178 --> 01:02:01.722
I'm really beginning to like this place...

560
01:02:02.723 --> 01:02:03.932
and the people.

561
01:02:05.851 --> 01:02:09.062
I'm starting to believe.
from the bottom of my heart.

562
01:02:09.062 --> 01:02:11.231
that this is where I'm supposed to be.

563
01:02:11.899 --> 01:02:16.403
So. whatever it is
that you and your friends do.

564
01:02:17.070 --> 01:02:19.865
please do it somewhere else.

565
01:02:24.203 --> 01:02:26.496
- You warning me?
- I'm preparing you.

566
01:02:27.623 --> 01:02:29.541
Did you get what he said?

567
01:02:29.541 --> 01:02:32.169
He's getting ready. He's fun!

568
01:02:39.676 --> 01:02:41.261
Is that a Timex?

569
01:02:44.389 --> 01:02:45.432
No.

570
01:02:46.517 --> 01:02:47.726
It's a Bulgar--

571
01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:50.979
Right there. Right there.

572
01:02:50.979 --> 01:02:52.314
Sit down.

573
01:02:52.314 --> 01:02:53.398
Sit!

574
01:02:59.029 --> 01:03:02.616
That's the median nerve
that I'm compressing.

575
01:03:03.992 --> 01:03:06.703
On a scale from one to ten.

576
01:03:06.703 --> 01:03:08.121
that's a two.

577
01:03:10.499 --> 01:03:11.500
That's a three.

578
01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:13.544
You don't want me to go to four.

579
01:03:13.544 --> 01:03:16.171
I go to four. you'll shit on yourself.
You don't want that.

580
01:03:16.171 --> 01:03:18.298
I don't want that. They don't want that.

581
01:03:27.015 --> 01:03:30.185
Tell your <i>compadres</i> that they can leave.
Tell them to beat it.

582
01:03:30.185 --> 01:03:32.563
Go away! Go away. now!

583
01:03:39.319 --> 01:03:41.071
It's called "pain compliance."

584
01:03:41.864 --> 01:03:44.491
Your brain is telling you to do one thing.

585
01:03:44.491 --> 01:03:46.743
but your body's telling you
something else.

586
01:03:48.954 --> 01:03:50.289
Now. listen to me.

587
01:03:50.289 --> 01:03:53.709
Take the gun out of your waist.
Put it on the table.

588
01:03:58.088 --> 01:03:59.423
Slowly.

589
01:04:35.751 --> 01:04:37.044
Get the van.

590
01:04:42.466 --> 01:04:43.967
This fucking American.

591
01:04:44.468 --> 01:04:45.844
He meddles.

592
01:04:49.765 --> 01:04:50.599
Give me the cigarette.

593
01:04:56.772 --> 01:04:58.148
What do you want to do. Marco?

594
01:04:58.982 --> 01:05:01.860
I'm gonna execute that motherfucker.

595
01:05:04.947 --> 01:05:06.073
And Vincent?

596
01:05:09.576 --> 01:05:11.203
Fuck Vincent.

597
01:05:12.579 --> 01:05:14.790
He doesn't tell me what to do.

598
01:05:17.167 --> 01:05:19.378
Let's go. Give me your gun.

599
01:05:19.378 --> 01:05:21.505
Give me the gun. Understand?

600
01:06:44.546 --> 01:06:47.132
We found packages in the back of the van.

601
01:06:49.009 --> 01:06:51.011
Some kind of drug.

602
01:06:54.848 --> 01:06:56.266
Not the usual.

603
01:07:02.105 --> 01:07:05.859
Gonna send some techs down here
to go through it.

604
01:07:36.223 --> 01:07:38.267
- Hey.
<i>- Turn on your TV.</i>

605
01:07:42.062 --> 01:07:44.857
{\an8}<i>...that the explosion at the train station</i>

606
01:07:44.857 --> 01:07:47.943
{\an8}<i>is the result
of an as-yet-unclaimed terrorist attack.</i>

607
01:07:47.943 --> 01:07:50.279
{\an8}<i>At the moment there are no suspects.</i>

608
01:07:50.279 --> 01:07:52.906
- Were you able to ID the--?
- Syrian nationals.

609
01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:56.201
Found their bomb-making factory
in some sixth-floor apartment.

610
01:07:57.035 --> 01:07:59.788
- Were there any other--?
- <i>Plans for the train station. yeah.</i>

611
01:07:59.788 --> 01:08:03.083
Plus bomb parts. sophisticated pieces.

612
01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:07.504
That's what their drug money
has been funding. Where are you?

613
01:08:07.504 --> 01:08:09.673
- Naples.
<i>- Get back now.</i>

614
01:08:10.632 --> 01:08:12.050
Why Sicily?

615
01:08:12.050 --> 01:08:14.928
- Why?
<i>- Why not Elba or Sardinia?</i>

616
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:17.598
Makes no sense. Frank.

617
01:08:17.598 --> 01:08:19.933
running drugs through
the most secure port in the region.

618
01:08:19.933 --> 01:08:23.812
So you're thinking that
the mainland faction took possession in--

619
01:08:23.812 --> 01:08:24.897
<i>In Naples.</i>

620
01:08:24.897 --> 01:08:26.982
It's the easiest port
to slip things through.

621
01:08:28.774 --> 01:08:30.444
- I think they're here.
<i>- So?</i>

622
01:08:31.111 --> 01:08:33.822
{\an8}We find the street dealers.
drill down hard on them.

623
01:08:33.822 --> 01:08:36.575
<i>- Get them to give up their suppliers.</i>
- Who give up wholesalers.

624
01:08:36.575 --> 01:08:38.493
Bottom up. That's good.

625
01:08:39.995 --> 01:08:42.747
Okay. I'll work down from the dead guys.

626
01:08:42.747 --> 01:08:44.791
- If you're right--
- See you at the finish line.

627
01:08:45.542 --> 01:08:46.542
<i>Ciao.</i>

628
01:08:51.256 --> 01:08:54.091
CIA appreciates
your willing cooperation. chief.

629
01:08:58.846 --> 01:09:00.807
We are at your disposal.

630
01:09:03.977 --> 01:09:05.729
And what are you doing right now?

631
01:09:06.563 --> 01:09:08.189
Right now we're gathering information.

632
01:09:10.234 --> 01:09:11.568
I'd like to question these men.

633
01:09:43.225 --> 01:09:44.059
Him...

634
01:09:44.725 --> 01:09:46.395
you can't interview.

635
01:10:04.663 --> 01:10:06.957
You interrupted my breakfast.

636
01:10:08.125 --> 01:10:09.126
So...

637
01:10:09.793 --> 01:10:10.919
what's the deal?

638
01:10:10.919 --> 01:10:13.839
Oh. I'm sorry. did someone tell you
that there was a deal?

639
01:10:15.507 --> 01:10:17.217
I'm not here to negotiate.

640
01:10:18.343 --> 01:10:20.220
I'm here to give you an opportunity.

641
01:10:21.263 --> 01:10:24.683
I need some information.
And you're going to give it to me.

642
01:12:20.799 --> 01:12:22.676
I'm sorry about your brother.

643
01:12:25.304 --> 01:12:26.263
Thank you.

644
01:12:28.557 --> 01:12:29.516
Take a seat.

645
01:12:38.567 --> 01:12:41.195
There is a matter
that I have to talk to you about.

646
01:12:42.154 --> 01:12:43.113
Not today.

647
01:12:44.489 --> 01:12:45.741
The CIA arrived.

648
01:12:46.450 --> 01:12:50.370
They are looking for a terrorist cell
importing a jihad drug

649
01:12:50.370 --> 01:12:51.872
and selling it across the EU.

650
01:12:52.873 --> 01:12:54.625
Then take care of it.

651
01:12:55.459 --> 01:12:56.585
You need to shut everything down.

652
01:12:58.795 --> 01:12:59.922
There is a woman...

653
01:13:01.215 --> 01:13:02.049
she's smart.

654
01:13:04.593 --> 01:13:06.803
She'll figure out
that it wasn't the terrorists...

655
01:13:09.097 --> 01:13:10.599
but it was you.

656
01:13:11.850 --> 01:13:12.726
The Camorra...

657
01:13:14.019 --> 01:13:16.063
buying drugs from the enemy...

658
01:13:16.813 --> 01:13:21.652
and selling them on our own streets
to finance your enterprises.

659
01:13:22.069 --> 01:13:23.570
You have to do your job.

660
01:13:26.365 --> 01:13:29.243
Did you see what they did
with the money you paid them?

661
01:13:30.619 --> 01:13:33.622
Did you see how many people died
in that train station attack?

662
01:13:37.417 --> 01:13:38.961
Our people.

663
01:13:39.461 --> 01:13:41.672
If I wasn't buying their drugs...

664
01:13:42.798 --> 01:13:43.966
somebody else would have...

665
01:13:45.008 --> 01:13:47.219
and the same people would be dead.

666
01:13:50.556 --> 01:13:51.974
I'll take care of the woman.

667
01:13:52.516 --> 01:13:54.351
You make sure nothing touches me.

668
01:13:54.852 --> 01:13:56.728
So you understood nothing.

669
01:13:58.021 --> 01:13:58.939
Nothing.

670
01:13:58.939 --> 01:14:00.315
You're right.

671
01:14:01.608 --> 01:14:03.151
I don't give a shit.

672
01:14:04.444 --> 01:14:07.114
My brother is dead
and you're here talking about bullshit.

673
01:14:08.031 --> 01:14:09.366
Without any information.

674
01:14:11.869 --> 01:14:13.412
Are you stupid?

675
01:14:14.830 --> 01:14:16.748
Or have you forgotten your place?

676
01:14:22.838 --> 01:14:24.047
My place...

677
01:14:25.174 --> 01:14:27.134
is head of the police.

678
01:14:29.553 --> 01:14:31.388
Did you forget who you are?

679
01:14:32.723 --> 01:14:34.349
You were a barbarian...

680
01:14:40.439 --> 01:14:42.316
and a barbarian you'll always be.

681
01:14:42.316 --> 01:14:43.233
I warned you.

682
01:14:43.734 --> 01:14:45.611
- Where are you going?
- Stay here.

683
01:14:52.117 --> 01:14:55.078
You must find who killed my brother.
Piece of shit! Understood?

684
01:15:02.294 --> 01:15:03.337
Shut up!

685
01:15:04.004 --> 01:15:06.507
Now my barbarians will bring you
to the hospital.

686
01:15:07.633 --> 01:15:10.385
Hurry up and maybe one day
you'll wiggle a couple of fingers.

687
01:15:46.630 --> 01:15:48.048
Did you get my message?

688
01:15:48.549 --> 01:15:51.802
Next time I'll take your head
and mail it to your grandchildren.

689
01:15:52.427 --> 01:15:54.805
Appreciate you giving us
a hand on this. Barella.

690
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:56.932
Let's go. Antonio.

691
01:16:02.729 --> 01:16:04.273
These came from the back of the van.

692
01:16:06.108 --> 01:16:07.693
Never seen something like that before.

693
01:16:15.617 --> 01:16:18.579
- What's going on?
- Chief Barella's been attacked.

694
01:16:18.579 --> 01:16:20.789
- By who?
- We don't know.

695
01:16:20.789 --> 01:16:23.375
But he has information
regarding your investigation.

696
01:16:24.126 --> 01:16:27.296
This officer will escort you
to the hospital. Now. excuse me.

697
01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:33.302
<i>You're looking in the wrong place.</i>

698
01:16:33.886 --> 01:16:34.720
McCall?

699
01:16:35.387 --> 01:16:36.597
<i>It's not terrorists.</i>

700
01:16:37.222 --> 01:16:38.307
<i>It's the Camorra.</i>

701
01:16:39.725 --> 01:16:41.810
<i>- Be careful.</i>
- Let me call you back in a minute.

702
01:17:40.077 --> 01:17:41.328
- Collins.
- Frank!

703
01:17:41.912 --> 01:17:43.163
Is she gonna be okay?

704
01:17:47.084 --> 01:17:49.878
We're not looking for terrorists.
It's the Camorra.

705
01:17:52.923 --> 01:17:54.383
Take care of her. okay?

706
01:17:55.342 --> 01:17:58.053
I got this. I got this. Collins.
You're gonna be okay.

707
01:17:58.053 --> 01:17:59.137
Okay.

708
01:18:37.551 --> 01:18:39.219
Altamonte!

709
01:18:40.637 --> 01:18:43.557
My brother was murdered on your streets!

710
01:18:44.016 --> 01:18:46.101
Bring me who did it...

711
01:18:46.101 --> 01:18:48.478
and I will reward you!

712
01:19:03.202 --> 01:19:05.037
You know who did it.

713
01:19:07.831 --> 01:19:09.374
Tell me who killed my brother!

714
01:19:20.010 --> 01:19:22.346
Next time it'll be more than your ear.

715
01:19:37.236 --> 01:19:39.321
How many will I kill today?

716
01:19:40.489 --> 01:19:42.282
Say who killed my brother...

717
01:19:44.034 --> 01:19:46.662
or I'll kill your family while you watch.

718
01:19:54.711 --> 01:19:56.129
Show yourself!

719
01:19:57.714 --> 01:19:58.715
It's me you want.

720
01:20:00.801 --> 01:20:02.135
I killed your brother.

721
01:20:03.637 --> 01:20:04.930
I asked him:

722
01:20:06.056 --> 01:20:09.142
"Leave these people alone."
He wouldn't listen. so...

723
01:20:10.602 --> 01:20:12.187
You're a long way from home...

724
01:20:12.896 --> 01:20:14.064
American.

725
01:20:16.066 --> 01:20:17.818
I'm where I'm supposed to be.

726
01:20:18.610 --> 01:20:19.611
Here I am.

727
01:20:21.029 --> 01:20:22.030
Here I am.

728
01:20:23.407 --> 01:20:25.534
You understand what happens now?

729
01:20:25.534 --> 01:20:27.870
I understand weakness. I understand pain.

730
01:20:27.870 --> 01:20:30.455
I understand death.
I understand suffering.

731
01:20:30.455 --> 01:20:32.958
And because of these people.
I'm starting to understand peace.

732
01:20:32.958 --> 01:20:34.585
You can't take that away from me.

733
01:20:37.004 --> 01:20:40.591
God is my witness.
you're not gonna take it away from them.

734
01:20:41.341 --> 01:20:43.302
So do you understand? That's the question.

735
01:20:43.844 --> 01:20:47.431
- I understand I can take anything I want.
- Then take me.

736
01:20:47.431 --> 01:20:50.184
Since you can take anything you want.
take me. Here I am.

737
01:20:50.184 --> 01:20:51.810
Here I am. Take me.

738
01:20:52.519 --> 01:20:53.520
Take me.

739
01:20:55.314 --> 01:20:56.440
Just don't do it here.

740
01:21:00.235 --> 01:21:02.487
But this is the best place. American.

741
01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:05.115
On these cobblestones.

742
01:21:06.325 --> 01:21:10.537
So these people can see
and tell others what they witnessed.

743
01:21:23.342 --> 01:21:25.511
You don't have to do this. my son.

744
01:21:28.472 --> 01:21:29.473
Okay.

745
01:21:30.015 --> 01:21:31.016
Your choice.

746
01:21:32.726 --> 01:21:33.810
It's your choice.

747
01:21:36.772 --> 01:21:38.774
It's always my choice.

748
01:21:52.538 --> 01:21:55.290
- Really?
- Vincent.

749
01:21:55.290 --> 01:21:56.917
Then shoot me too!

750
01:21:56.917 --> 01:21:58.544
Then kill me!

751
01:22:02.047 --> 01:22:04.633
We gotta go.
They're recording us. Vincent.

752
01:22:06.426 --> 01:22:07.594
Let her go.

753
01:22:10.097 --> 01:22:11.849
What a beautiful moment.

754
01:22:12.933 --> 01:22:14.560
But it won't last long.

755
01:22:17.271 --> 01:22:21.316
So enjoy it. American.
'Cause I'll be back.

756
01:22:21.316 --> 01:22:22.401
I'll be here.

757
01:22:22.401 --> 01:22:25.237
And I'll leave this place
like a war blew through it.

758
01:22:26.363 --> 01:22:28.490
I'll be waiting for you. Hurry up.

759
01:22:28.490 --> 01:22:30.367
I'll kill you all!

760
01:22:30.367 --> 01:22:32.411
Boss. we've got to go.
The police are coming.

761
01:22:32.411 --> 01:22:34.746
I'll see you soon. I'll see you very soon.

762
01:22:34.746 --> 01:22:35.998
Let's go!

763
01:22:35.998 --> 01:22:37.624
Hurry up. Sooner than you think.

764
01:23:13.785 --> 01:23:15.287
What do we know about the American?

765
01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:17.414
Nothing.

766
01:23:18.248 --> 01:23:19.374
No one is talking.

767
01:23:20.083 --> 01:23:21.919
We checked also with our contacts but...

768
01:23:21.919 --> 01:23:22.836
nothing.

769
01:23:24.463 --> 01:23:25.297
No one is talking?

770
01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:29.426
Could be FBI. the CIA...

771
01:23:30.636 --> 01:23:31.678
Interpol...

772
01:23:32.471 --> 01:23:33.972
We don't know. Vincent.

773
01:23:35.599 --> 01:23:40.312
What if it's one of our enemies.
one of the other families?

774
01:23:45.108 --> 01:23:46.443
We will kill the American.

775
01:23:47.611 --> 01:23:50.405
We will kill the American.
we will burn that fucking place!

776
01:23:51.114 --> 01:23:51.949
Tomorrow. Simone.

777
01:23:53.033 --> 01:23:53.867
Tomorrow.

778
01:26:03.997 --> 01:26:05.332
What the fuck?

779
01:26:07.042 --> 01:26:07.960
Go check.

780
01:26:16.468 --> 01:26:17.386
Nothing.

781
01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:20.180
There's no one there.

782
01:27:27.122 --> 01:27:28.165
Salvatore?

783
01:27:33.128 --> 01:27:34.129
SalvatÃ²!

784
01:27:37.591 --> 01:27:38.425
Salvat--

785
01:28:43.365 --> 01:28:44.199
Simone.

786
01:28:46.577 --> 01:28:47.870
Antonio?

787
01:28:50.205 --> 01:28:51.248
SalvatÃ²?

788
01:28:55.127 --> 01:28:56.753
SalvatÃ²?

789
01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:10.726
Salvatore?

790
01:29:13.896 --> 01:29:15.397
Antonio?

791
01:30:11.078 --> 01:30:12.996
SalvatÃ²! SalvatÃ²!

792
01:30:14.498 --> 01:30:15.332
GiÃ².

793
01:30:16.834 --> 01:30:18.293
GiÃ²! GiÃ².

794
01:30:50.284 --> 01:30:51.827
Don't fuck with me!

795
01:31:12.931 --> 01:31:13.932
My men...

796
01:31:15.017 --> 01:31:16.685
are going to find you...

797
01:31:19.146 --> 01:31:21.940
and kill you like a dog.

798
01:31:32.910 --> 01:31:34.494
We all have to face...

799
01:31:37.206 --> 01:31:38.373
Death.

800
01:31:38.373 --> 01:31:39.958
Who the fuck are you?

801
01:31:44.296 --> 01:31:45.964
<i>It was the blood</i>

802
01:31:55.849 --> 01:31:57.059
Who are you?

803
01:32:00.145 --> 01:32:03.857
You have less than six minutes
before the pills stop your heart.

804
01:32:04.733 --> 01:32:05.943
Who are you?

805
01:32:22.125 --> 01:32:23.502
<i>So I know</i>

806
01:32:25.295 --> 01:32:26.880
<i>It was the blood</i>

807
01:32:29.007 --> 01:32:30.217
<i>For me</i>

808
01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:36.223
<i>One day when I was lost</i>

809
01:33:22.477 --> 01:33:23.478
Marco!

810
01:33:36.742 --> 01:33:38.410
Marco!

811
01:34:59.825 --> 01:35:00.868
Who are you?

812
01:35:48.999 --> 01:35:51.293
<i>One day when I was lost</i>

813
01:36:08.602 --> 01:36:09.937
<i>In a coordinated effort.</i>

814
01:36:09.937 --> 01:36:13.732
{\an8}<i>the CIA and Interpol have seized
enough synthetic amphetamine</i>

815
01:36:13.732 --> 01:36:18.529
{\an8}<i>to kill 2.1 million people.
more than the population of Naples. Italy.</i>

816
01:36:19.196 --> 01:36:21.406
<i>Taking down
the local Camorra leadership.</i>

817
01:36:21.406 --> 01:36:24.076
{\an8}<i>the operation has disrupted
the drug trade.</i>

818
01:36:24.076 --> 01:36:26.620
{\an8}<i>cutting funding to a terrorist cell.</i>

819
01:36:26.620 --> 01:36:28.830
{\an8}<i>And in a just-breaking story:</i>

820
01:36:28.830 --> 01:36:32.626
{\an8}<i>Vincent Quaranta. alleged head
of the Camorra's five families.</i>

821
01:36:32.626 --> 01:36:35.420
<i>was found dead
on a Naples street last night</i>

822
01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:39.466
<i>from an apparent overdose
on the very drug he sold on those streets.</i>

823
01:36:40.425 --> 01:36:41.927
Missing all the fun.

824
01:36:42.594 --> 01:36:44.346
Cracking it was the fun part.

825
01:36:48.892 --> 01:36:49.893
Thank you.

826
01:36:50.519 --> 01:36:52.771
- For what?
- That phone call.

827
01:36:54.147 --> 01:36:55.232
It saved my life.

828
01:36:56.817 --> 01:36:57.818
Welcome.

829
01:36:59.069 --> 01:37:00.445
Is that your go bag?

830
01:37:02.865 --> 01:37:07.744
No. it's $366.400.

831
01:37:07.744 --> 01:37:09.955
Cash. U.S.

832
01:37:11.373 --> 01:37:12.416
Sicily.

833
01:37:13.375 --> 01:37:15.460
Got into that money room. didn't you?

834
01:37:19.214 --> 01:37:20.340
So. what's it for?

835
01:37:21.049 --> 01:37:22.885
It's Greg Dyer's pension.

836
01:37:23.969 --> 01:37:24.803
Who?

837
01:37:24.803 --> 01:37:28.223
Greg Dyer. He's a bricklayer.
Forty-three years.

838
01:37:28.223 --> 01:37:29.683
Retired.

839
01:37:29.683 --> 01:37:32.978
His union's pension fund got hacked
nine months ago.

840
01:37:34.646 --> 01:37:37.774
So he lost everything
he worked his entire life for

841
01:37:38.525 --> 01:37:41.028
in one stroke of a key.

842
01:37:41.028 --> 01:37:44.156
So you tracked down
some guy's life savings

843
01:37:44.156 --> 01:37:47.951
to a cyber ghost that no one
has been able to find for years...

844
01:37:48.994 --> 01:37:51.455
that happens to be
a drug-smuggling way station?

845
01:37:51.455 --> 01:37:54.416
I didn't know that
till I got in there. but yeah.

846
01:37:54.416 --> 01:37:57.419
Then you snipe your way
into a fortified room...

847
01:37:58.795 --> 01:38:02.299
with millions of dollars.
bearer bonds. account codes...

848
01:38:03.592 --> 01:38:07.137
All you take is 300 grand
of Dwyer's pension.

849
01:38:07.971 --> 01:38:11.767
366.400.

850
01:38:13.101 --> 01:38:15.521
Cash. U.S. And it's "Dyer."

851
01:38:16.605 --> 01:38:20.025
- Is this guy some friend of yours?
- No. No.

852
01:38:22.027 --> 01:38:23.362
Gave him a Lyft once.

853
01:38:27.407 --> 01:38:28.575
I don't understand.

854
01:38:29.952 --> 01:38:30.953
You will.

855
01:38:50.222 --> 01:38:51.557
<i>- Greg Dyer?
- Yeah?</i>

856
01:38:51.557 --> 01:38:53.517
<i>I'm Emma Collins.
We spoke on the phone.</i>

857
01:38:53.517 --> 01:38:54.643
<i>Come on in.</i>

858
01:38:56.436 --> 01:38:57.271
So...

859
01:39:02.192 --> 01:39:03.193
What's this?

860
01:39:04.027 --> 01:39:06.905
$366.400.

861
01:39:08.073 --> 01:39:09.157
It's your pension.

862
01:39:13.495 --> 01:39:14.329
Can I open it?

863
01:39:38.395 --> 01:39:40.063
- How did you--?
- Wasn't me.

864
01:39:40.939 --> 01:39:41.940
Who. then?

865
01:39:43.525 --> 01:39:44.985
I couldn't tell you.

866
01:39:46.778 --> 01:39:47.779
Why?

867
01:39:49.031 --> 01:39:51.867
Why something like this for a stranger?

868
01:39:52.951 --> 01:39:54.119
That's a good question.

869
01:39:59.458 --> 01:40:01.001
You can unpack everything.

870
01:40:02.169 --> 01:40:04.046
We're not going anywhere now.

871
01:40:04.755 --> 01:40:06.673
Well. thank you.

872
01:40:09.384 --> 01:40:10.385
Thank you.

873
01:40:25.275 --> 01:40:27.027
Someone left this for you
at the front desk.

874
01:40:27.027 --> 01:40:29.196
- How you feeling?
- Hundred percent.

875
01:40:29.196 --> 01:40:32.533
Good. 'Cause we got a meeting
with the director in 30 minutes.

876
01:40:32.533 --> 01:40:35.160
He wants to meet the person
who broke open the Italian situation.

877
01:40:35.827 --> 01:40:36.828
Nicely done.

878
01:41:21.582 --> 01:41:22.833
We won!

879
01:41:22.833 --> 01:41:24.001
I see!

880
01:41:25.169 --> 01:41:27.504
It's a big deal for Altamonte.

881
01:42:06.293 --> 01:42:07.127
Ciao.

882
01:42:09.296 --> 01:42:11.215
Roberto. You forgot this.
