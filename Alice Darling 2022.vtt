00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:38.636

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.985
Hey!ALICE: Sorry I'm late.

5
00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:41.944
No!ALICE: Rude.

6
00:02:41.987 --> 00:02:43.946
I'm so sorry.No. it's fine.

7
00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.817
It's fine.WAITER: Ladies.

8
00:02:46.601 --> 00:02:48.080
Hey.Hey.

9
00:02:48.124 --> 00:02:49.473
Um. we'll have

10
00:02:49.517 --> 00:02:51.475
a bottle of the chardonnay

11
00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:52.911
and three glasses.
please.

12
00:02:52.955 --> 00:02:54.739
Sure.ALICE: Oh. no. Actually.

13
00:02:54.783 --> 00:02:55.914
a vodka soda for me.
thank you.

14
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.268
Uh. the waiter's
in love with you.

15
00:03:02.704 --> 00:03:04.488
I mean. I really feel like
he does not know

16
00:03:04.532 --> 00:03:06.621
the definition
of the word "boundaries."

17
00:03:06.664 --> 00:03:09.014
Yeah. because he sent you.
like. 14 dick pics.

18
00:03:09.058 --> 00:03:12.496
Oh. and... he waxes.

19
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.932
Wow.SOPHIE: Yeah.

20
00:03:13.976 --> 00:03:15.847
No!Like. the whole...

21
00:03:15.891 --> 00:03:18.110
Really? But why?

22
00:03:18.154 --> 00:03:19.460
I don't know.

23
00:03:20.678 --> 00:03:23.377
Oh. Alice's guy
from the swim team?

24
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.117
Okay. we don't have
to talk about Dolphin Dave.

25
00:03:25.161 --> 00:03:27.816
I want to have a nice night.
thank you very much.

26
00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:29.818
Like. I don't think
that shaving
his body hair was

27
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:31.472
gonna make the difference
between Olympic trials

28
00:03:31.515 --> 00:03:32.473
or not.

29
00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:34.605
Oh. God.

30
00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:36.694
Sorry.

31
00:03:37.826 --> 00:03:39.262
Okay.Thank you.

32
00:03:39.306 --> 00:03:41.221
Oh. thank you!You're very welcome.

33
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:42.874
Sophie.

34
00:03:42.918 --> 00:03:44.180
The bottle.

35
00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:49.098
And vodka soda.

36
00:03:49.403 --> 00:03:50.665
Oh.

37
00:03:50.708 --> 00:03:52.797
Yeah. you're
welcome.

38
00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:54.495
He's obsessed
with you.Sophie. stop.

39
00:03:54.538 --> 00:03:55.931
You don't see it?
Don't tell me
you don't see it.

40
00:03:55.974 --> 00:03:57.498
I have a boyfriend.

41
00:03:57.541 --> 00:03:58.977
Sophie. leave her alone.

42
00:03:59.021 --> 00:04:00.675
Yes. thank you.

43
00:04:01.502 --> 00:04:03.504
Sorry. it's
just Simon.

44
00:04:03.547 --> 00:04:05.897
Um. actually. he has
a gallery opening on Friday.

45
00:04:05.941 --> 00:04:08.335
he wanted me to invite
both of you guys.Oh!

46
00:04:08.378 --> 00:04:09.858
That'd be great.
That... Yeah. Yeah?

47
00:04:09.901 --> 00:04:10.902
Yeah?

48
00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:12.817
Yeah. definitely.

49
00:04:12.861 --> 00:04:14.254
I just know there's. like...

50
00:04:14.297 --> 00:04:16.604
collectors coming
and so he was saying

51
00:04:16.647 --> 00:04:18.258
how much he would love
to introduce you.

52
00:04:18.301 --> 00:04:21.870
Well. I'm not really working
in traditional media anymore.

53
00:04:21.913 --> 00:04:23.959
Oh. That's amazing.
that's awesome.

54
00:04:24.002 --> 00:04:25.439
It's new. we'll see.

55
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:27.832
Yeah. Uh...

56
00:04:27.876 --> 00:04:29.356
Well. cheers.

57
00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:30.879
Cheers.

58
00:04:30.922 --> 00:04:32.794
Good to see you.You too.

59
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.993
Okay. so.
for my birthday...Yes.

60
00:04:58.036 --> 00:05:00.952
No. No. no.
Your 30th.

61
00:05:00.996 --> 00:05:02.911
We were
thinking the three
of us could go

62
00:05:02.954 --> 00:05:04.216
to my parents' house
up north.

63
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.394
Don't worry.
Don and Sylvie
are in Florida.

64
00:05:07.437 --> 00:05:09.570
so they will not be
gate-crashing the party.

65
00:05:09.613 --> 00:05:11.659
Okay.You're gonna come. right?

66
00:05:11.702 --> 00:05:14.226
You gotta come.
it's gonna be fun.
And I demand it.

67
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.619
I will
definitely see.

68
00:05:17.186 --> 00:05:18.535
Oh.I should just go soon.

69
00:05:33.463 --> 00:05:34.508
Hello?

70
00:06:26.647 --> 00:06:28.257
Oh. my God!

71
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.345
Oh. my God!

72
00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:30.520
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

73
00:06:30.564 --> 00:06:32.479
I didn't think
you'd be
so jumpy.

74
00:06:35.786 --> 00:06:36.918
How was
your night?

75
00:06:39.921 --> 00:06:41.139
I liked your picture.

76
00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.579
Just one. huh?We were at dinner!

77
00:06:53.151 --> 00:06:54.457
Well. we're home now.

78
00:07:43.201 --> 00:07:45.290
Oh. you must be
feeling bad this morning.

79
00:07:49.425 --> 00:07:50.992
Feeling bad?

80
00:07:51.035 --> 00:07:52.994
I'm
feeling good.
but I didn't

81
00:07:53.037 --> 00:07:54.125
go hard
on the cocktails
last night.

82
00:07:54.169 --> 00:07:55.736
I did not go...

83
00:07:55.779 --> 00:07:57.955
Never just a quiet
night with them two.
is it?

84
00:07:57.999 --> 00:07:59.479
No.

85
00:07:59.522 --> 00:08:01.655
Do you want
a cardamom bun

86
00:08:01.698 --> 00:08:03.700
or a Danish?

87
00:08:03.744 --> 00:08:05.963
I thought
we were cutting
back on sugar.

88
00:08:06.007 --> 00:08:07.312
Well. we are.
but. you know.

89
00:08:07.356 --> 00:08:08.618
we're good
all through
the week.

90
00:08:08.662 --> 00:08:09.706
we can treat
ourselves every
once in a while.

91
00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:10.838
can't we?

92
00:08:10.881 --> 00:08:12.230
Okay. whatever
looks good.

93
00:08:20.891 --> 00:08:23.067
Excuse me.
can I just get
two coffees...

94
00:08:28.464 --> 00:08:29.770
Yeah. it just came up.

95
00:08:30.422 --> 00:08:32.076
Just came up.

96
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.208
Just came up.

97
00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:36.646
Do you remember
that sales thing?

98
00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.343
Well. I think
it'd be bad
if I missed it.

99
00:08:39.475 --> 00:08:41.042
Oh. so Colleen texted me.

100
00:08:42.391 --> 00:08:44.785
Okay. Good to see you.
take care. bye!

101
00:08:44.828 --> 00:08:46.047
Yeah. it just
came up.

102
00:08:47.265 --> 00:08:48.397
They never
remember me
in there.

103
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.616
Like. I come
in here
every week.

104
00:08:49.659 --> 00:08:51.139
it wouldn't
kill them
to say hello.

105
00:08:51.182 --> 00:08:52.532
They're so
weird in there.

106
00:08:54.316 --> 00:08:55.404
Okay. what do
you want?

107
00:08:55.447 --> 00:08:57.275
Danish looks
all right.

108
00:08:57.319 --> 00:08:58.581
It looks like
fresh out
of the oven.

109
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:02.629
Oh. so Colleen
texted me

110
00:09:02.672 --> 00:09:04.065
this morning
about that
sales thing.

111
00:09:04.108 --> 00:09:06.328
Do you remember
this thing I told
you about?

112
00:09:06.371 --> 00:09:08.809
Well. anyway. it turns out
now they do need me to go.

113
00:09:08.852 --> 00:09:10.375
Why?

114
00:09:10.419 --> 00:09:12.203
Just. I came up.
I guess.

115
00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:15.206
I mean. it's
gonna be boring.
you know?

116
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:16.425
A trip to Minneapolis.

117
00:09:16.468 --> 00:09:18.079
but I think it'd be bad
if I missed it.

118
00:09:18.122 --> 00:09:20.908
I guess you just
give me the impression

119
00:09:20.951 --> 00:09:22.518
that you didn't
really care
about that job.

120
00:09:24.041 --> 00:09:25.390
I think you can do
better than that.

121
00:09:36.401 --> 00:09:38.316
A blank canvas
can be intimidating.

122
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.491
How do you
get started?

123
00:09:39.535 --> 00:09:41.624
Uh.
experimentation.
you know.

124
00:09:41.668 --> 00:09:42.886
Well. you know.
I try to be free
with it.

125
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:44.932
I just... I'm
boring myself.

126
00:09:44.975 --> 00:09:47.369
I show everything
to Alice at a very
early stage.

127
00:09:48.762 --> 00:09:50.198
Oh. I'll be
right back.

128
00:09:53.418 --> 00:09:55.116
Hi!Oh. my God.

129
00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.033
Oh. God.
I feel like
a potato.

130
00:09:59.076 --> 00:10:00.121
You couldn't
be a potato.

131
00:10:00.164 --> 00:10:01.252
You look nice.
though.

132
00:10:01.296 --> 00:10:02.950
Oh. yeah.
Simon got
it for me.

133
00:10:02.993 --> 00:10:04.125
It's expensive.

134
00:10:05.779 --> 00:10:07.258
Uh. where's Tess.
I thought you were
gonna come together?

135
00:10:07.302 --> 00:10:09.565
Um. so. she's...

136
00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:10.958
Okay. she's
not coming.

137
00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:13.700
It's just... yeah.
she said she would.

138
00:10:13.743 --> 00:10:14.918
so I put her
on the list. and I...I know.

139
00:10:14.962 --> 00:10:16.267
Please don't
be mad at her.No. I'm...

140
00:10:16.311 --> 00:10:17.834
It's fine. it's fine.You know what she's like

141
00:10:17.878 --> 00:10:19.357
when it comes
to work stuff.I know.

142
00:10:19.401 --> 00:10:21.272
She gets all in
her head and...

143
00:10:21.316 --> 00:10:22.534
you know. I'm sorry.

144
00:10:22.578 --> 00:10:24.014
It's fine.Hey!

145
00:10:24.058 --> 00:10:25.755
Hi. Sophie.Hi!

146
00:10:25.799 --> 00:10:27.670
Thank you!
Oh. my God.
I need this.

147
00:10:27.714 --> 00:10:29.280
You learn
pretty quick

148
00:10:29.324 --> 00:10:30.804
that the
non-profit world.

149
00:10:30.847 --> 00:10:33.545
it attracts nearly as many
narcissists and sociopaths

150
00:10:33.589 --> 00:10:36.287
as. like. the corporate
sector does. so...

151
00:10:36.331 --> 00:10:38.594
Well. I think
that what you do
is amazing.

152
00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:39.856
I do. I do.
I think it's
incredible.

153
00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.597
It's like
a million times
more important

154
00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:42.946
than any
of this. but...Oh. my God.

155
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:44.034
Thanks for
coming anyway.

156
00:10:44.078 --> 00:10:45.993
Stop it.
this is
amazing.

157
00:10:46.036 --> 00:10:47.777
Congratulations.Thank you.

158
00:10:47.821 --> 00:10:50.127
Thank you for
inviting me.

159
00:10:50.171 --> 00:10:51.607
I hope it's a
huge success.

160
00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:52.739
I'm so glad you
could make it.

161
00:10:52.782 --> 00:10:53.957
it's great
to see you.

162
00:11:00.834 --> 00:11:01.791
Thank you.

163
00:11:21.289 --> 00:11:22.464
Hey!

164
00:11:22.507 --> 00:11:23.595
Mmm.

165
00:11:25.859 --> 00:11:27.425
Mini pork bun?Oh. I'm fine.

166
00:11:27.469 --> 00:11:28.818
You sure?I'm fine.

167
00:11:28.862 --> 00:11:29.906
Alice. Uber's here.I'm sorry we didn't

168
00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:31.255
get to hang out
all night.It's okay.

169
00:11:31.299 --> 00:11:32.300
It's a big night
for him.

170
00:11:32.909 --> 00:11:34.694
So.

171
00:11:34.737 --> 00:11:36.043
you are gonna come
to the cottage. right?I promise. I promise.

172
00:11:36.086 --> 00:11:37.740
Alice!I'll see you tomorrow.

173
00:11:37.784 --> 00:11:38.915
good night.
I love you.Come on.

174
00:11:38.959 --> 00:11:40.700
Let's go!Goodnight. Love you. too.

175
00:11:47.271 --> 00:11:49.143
It was a complete
fucking train wreck.

176
00:11:49.186 --> 00:11:50.405
No one even showed up.

177
00:11:54.539 --> 00:11:56.019
There were. like.
a hundred people there.

178
00:11:56.063 --> 00:11:57.760
I'm talking about
important people.

179
00:12:00.807 --> 00:12:02.286
You still
don't understand
this business.

180
00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:03.635
it's cutthroat.

181
00:12:03.679 --> 00:12:04.636
If people
aren't coming
to your shows.

182
00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:05.899
it's because
you're washed up.

183
00:12:08.118 --> 00:12:09.424
You have
to be the best

184
00:12:10.599 --> 00:12:11.600
or you're nothing.

185
00:12:12.296 --> 00:12:13.863
You are the best.

186
00:12:17.388 --> 00:12:18.650
You are to me.

187
00:12:23.133 --> 00:12:25.092
Oh. my love.
I wish you could
see what I see.

188
00:12:29.139 --> 00:12:30.445
My perfectionist.

189
00:12:32.142 --> 00:12:33.491
You're so
brilliant.

190
00:12:34.841 --> 00:12:36.146
You're amazing.

191
00:12:38.627 --> 00:12:39.759
Hey.

192
00:12:49.159 --> 00:12:50.378
SIMON:
Hmm.

193
00:13:24.238 --> 00:13:25.848
Hey! Thank you.

Sophie. um.
can you pull over?

200
00:14:49.105 --> 00:14:50.150
You okay?

201
00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:57.287
Fuck. Sorry. guys.

202
00:14:57.331 --> 00:14:58.593
SOPHIE:
You okay?Yeah.

203
00:14:59.724 --> 00:15:02.075
SOPHIE:
Oh. God.
Oh. no.

204
00:15:02.118 --> 00:15:04.207
I shouldn't
have looked at
my phone. it's my bad.

205
00:15:04.251 --> 00:15:05.905
You're
all right.

206
00:15:11.649 --> 00:15:12.694
All right.TESS: I want birthday pancakes

207
00:15:12.737 --> 00:15:13.782
with real syrup.SOPHIE: Okay.

208
00:15:13.825 --> 00:15:15.523
Then leave the fake stuff.

209
00:15:15.566 --> 00:15:17.307
We got maple syrup right here.

210
00:15:17.351 --> 00:15:18.569
All right.SOPHIE: Okay.

211
00:15:18.613 --> 00:15:20.093
You want
chocolate chip
pancakes?

212
00:15:20.136 --> 00:15:21.921
Of course
you do. Okay.

213
00:15:21.964 --> 00:15:25.185
Two. And s'mores.

214
00:15:25.228 --> 00:15:27.491
Ooh.
S'mores!
Good idea.

215
00:15:27.535 --> 00:15:28.797
Okay.

216
00:15:34.194 --> 00:15:35.760
I think
it's just crazy.

217
00:15:35.804 --> 00:15:37.632
You can't let
a girl like that
wander around

218
00:15:37.675 --> 00:15:39.199
doing whatever
she wants.

219
00:15:39.242 --> 00:15:41.853
I mean.
of course. she's
gone missing.

220
00:15:41.897 --> 00:15:43.855
Parents have
no rules
anymore.

221
00:15:43.899 --> 00:15:45.857
My kids know exactly

222
00:15:45.901 --> 00:15:47.207
what kind of hell
there'd be to pay

223
00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:49.383
if I caught them
sneaking around
like that.

224
00:15:49.426 --> 00:15:52.081
I mean. why
would she put herself
in that situation?

225
00:16:06.269 --> 00:16:07.401
Shotgun.

226
00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:40.956
What's a yoga bro?

227
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.307
You know. it's those
super muscular guys

228
00:16:44.351 --> 00:16:46.396
that have to grunt
their way into every pose.

229
00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.833
It's totally performative.SOPHIE: Right.

230
00:16:48.877 --> 00:16:50.009
And they have
to fight their way

231
00:16:50.052 --> 00:16:51.184
to the front
of the class

232
00:16:51.227 --> 00:16:53.447
so everybody can see
their balls hanging.

233
00:17:00.193 --> 00:17:01.368
SOPHIE:
All right.

234
00:17:04.893 --> 00:17:06.025
Thank you.

235
00:17:07.983 --> 00:17:10.290
Oh. your dad finally
fixed the screen door.

236
00:17:10.333 --> 00:17:12.727
Yeah.
he did it when
he opened up.

237
00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:14.555
Got it.SOPHIE: Thank you.

238
00:17:14.598 --> 00:17:16.426
Okay.

239
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:18.341
All right.
You can put
that there.

240
00:17:19.125 --> 00:17:21.605
And then
through here.

241
00:17:22.867 --> 00:17:25.131
Okay. Tess.
you're in my
brother's room.

242
00:17:25.174 --> 00:17:27.220
Alice. you're
in my room
at the end.

243
00:17:27.263 --> 00:17:28.569
Great.SOPHIE: Yeah.

244
00:17:31.485 --> 00:17:34.009
Hmm.SOPHIE: Remember these?

245
00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:35.663
I love how
your mom never changes

246
00:17:35.706 --> 00:17:38.448
anything about
this place.

247
00:18:18.401 --> 00:18:19.968
All right.

248
00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:21.622
Thank you.

249
00:18:48.344 --> 00:18:50.390
You're right.

250
00:18:50.433 --> 00:18:52.348
Why... Why...
Why have
I stopped

251
00:18:52.392 --> 00:18:53.915
having sleep orgasms?

252
00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:55.090
That's
normal for you?

253
00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:56.352
In your sleep to...

254
00:18:56.396 --> 00:18:58.485
I like a free orgasm.

255
00:19:00.443 --> 00:19:02.097
Me. too. Oh. my God.

256
00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:03.533
Wouldn't have to
put in any work.

257
00:19:06.623 --> 00:19:08.190
I had a sex dream
the other night.

258
00:19:08.234 --> 00:19:09.322
Oh?

259
00:19:09.365 --> 00:19:11.280
No. I mean.
it was bad.

260
00:19:11.324 --> 00:19:12.586
Oh.It was...

261
00:19:12.629 --> 00:19:14.892
It was with the. um...

262
00:19:14.936 --> 00:19:16.981
the waiter from
the wine bar.

263
00:19:17.025 --> 00:19:18.766
He's hot.Ugh.

264
00:19:18.809 --> 00:19:20.507
Like. I shouldn't
be having

265
00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:23.074
sex dreams about
someone else
when I'm with Simon.

266
00:19:24.685 --> 00:19:26.034
Oof. Who
told you that?

267
00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:29.820
No one.
that's just
how I feel.

268
00:19:38.177 --> 00:19:40.831
Um. I'll clear...

269
00:19:52.016 --> 00:19:53.322
Alice.

270
00:19:56.412 --> 00:19:57.370
Alice.

271
00:19:59.937 --> 00:20:00.938
Alice!

272
00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:03.854
Look at me.

273
00:20:05.726 --> 00:20:06.814
You don't want me?

274
00:20:08.381 --> 00:20:10.557
I'm just tired.
Listen.

275
00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.472
If you don't want
to fuck me. you don't
want to fuck me.

276
00:20:12.515 --> 00:20:13.908
Alice.

277
00:20:13.951 --> 00:20:14.952
SOPHIE:
Alice?

278
00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:17.607
Will you come
join us?

279
00:20:19.566 --> 00:20:20.654
Sure.

280
00:20:31.186 --> 00:20:32.753
I don't know. I mean... I don't...

281
00:22:19.076 --> 00:22:21.905
Hey. everyone.
you are listening toHurdle.

282
00:22:21.949 --> 00:22:25.256
I am so. so excited
to bring you today's episode

283
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.825
because I am chatting
with my dear friend...

284
00:22:28.869 --> 00:22:30.610
...core values.
and we're living

285
00:22:30.653 --> 00:22:32.829
and breathing them
every day in our lives.

286
00:22:32.873 --> 00:22:35.397
That's what makes us
feel most fulfilled.
Right.

287
00:22:35.441 --> 00:22:36.964
So if you can
begin your day like that.

288
00:22:37.007 --> 00:22:38.444
so it's not own your morning.

289
00:22:38.487 --> 00:22:41.011
a.k.a.. like. do as much
as possible within.

290
00:22:41.055 --> 00:22:42.578
like. a three-hour time span

291
00:22:42.622 --> 00:22:44.580
starting at 4:00 a.m.
Correct.

292
00:22:44.624 --> 00:22:45.929
But they're
owning your morning

293
00:22:45.973 --> 00:22:47.583
by giving you and yourself.

294
00:22:47.627 --> 00:22:49.455
and your mental health.
and your soul what it needs.

295
00:23:20.355 --> 00:23:21.617
Hi there.

296
00:23:25.447 --> 00:23:28.232
Have you seen
this girl?
Andrea Evans.

297
00:23:28.276 --> 00:23:30.452
No. uh.
we just got here
yesterday.

298
00:23:30.496 --> 00:23:32.411
I'm sorry
I can't be
more helpful.

299
00:23:32.454 --> 00:23:33.977
You keep that.

300
00:23:34.021 --> 00:23:35.892
there's a hotline
you can call if
you've seen anything.

301
00:23:35.936 --> 00:23:38.199
Search parties leave
at 8:00 every morning
from the church.

302
00:23:38.242 --> 00:23:39.679
if you could
spare the time.

303
00:23:40.288 --> 00:23:42.159
Yeah. okay.

304
00:23:42.203 --> 00:23:44.684
Uh. thank you.
Or. good luck.

305
00:23:45.424 --> 00:23:46.555
Take care.

306
00:23:53.127 --> 00:23:54.824
Double
word score.

307
00:23:54.868 --> 00:23:58.349
Wow. "Door."
Wow. well done.

308
00:24:00.351 --> 00:24:02.571
You are making this
too easy.

309
00:24:02.615 --> 00:24:04.355
My turn. All right.

310
00:24:04.399 --> 00:24:05.400
All right.
That was rude.

311
00:24:06.619 --> 00:24:08.490
You really did it.

312
00:24:09.535 --> 00:24:10.971
SOPHIE:
Don't be mad.

313
00:24:11.841 --> 00:24:14.191
What? No.SOPHIE: Yes!

314
00:24:14.235 --> 00:24:16.019
Hey. Gossip Girl.
we need
a second opinion.

315
00:24:17.934 --> 00:24:19.153
Uh. what is it?

316
00:24:19.196 --> 00:24:20.459
"Quakey."

317
00:24:22.069 --> 00:24:24.637
Uh. maybe.

318
00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:27.291
We'll take that
as a yes.
so that is

319
00:24:27.335 --> 00:24:28.989
twenty-one.
double word score.

320
00:24:29.032 --> 00:24:30.730
Wait. why Gossip Girl?

321
00:24:30.773 --> 00:24:32.949
I don't know.
the phone. the hair.

322
00:24:36.997 --> 00:24:40.261
You are aware
that popular culture
has evolved

323
00:24:40.304 --> 00:24:42.437
over the
last decade.TESS: And?

324
00:24:42.481 --> 00:24:45.832
Maybe your
references are getting
a little bit stale.

325
00:24:45.875 --> 00:24:47.616
Yeah?TESS: Mm-hmm.

326
00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:48.922
A reboot?
With who?

327
00:25:42.453 --> 00:25:43.846
Hey.

328
00:25:52.115 --> 00:25:53.508
Um...

329
00:25:53.552 --> 00:25:55.728
so I think I'm gonna
have to leave early.

330
00:25:56.903 --> 00:25:58.078
I know.
it's just.
work is

331
00:25:58.121 --> 00:25:59.470
really intense
right now.

332
00:25:59.514 --> 00:26:02.343
Seriously?
We're here
for my birthday.

333
00:26:02.386 --> 00:26:05.041
I... Yeah.
I... Sorry. I...

334
00:26:06.477 --> 00:26:08.044
I don't really
expect you
to understand.

335
00:26:08.088 --> 00:26:09.611
You're right.
I don't understand.

336
00:26:09.655 --> 00:26:11.004
I was under
the impressionthat
we took the week off

337
00:26:11.047 --> 00:26:12.353
so that we could
spend it together.

338
00:26:12.396 --> 00:26:13.659
What are you taking
the week off from?

339
00:26:17.445 --> 00:26:19.012
I'm sorry.
does my work
not count

340
00:26:19.055 --> 00:26:20.361
because I don't
get paid for it?

341
00:26:20.404 --> 00:26:22.406
SOPHIE:
Of course. your
work counts. Tess.

342
00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:24.060
Your work is
amazing.

343
00:26:24.104 --> 00:26:26.846
Sophie. that's not

344
00:26:26.889 --> 00:26:28.238
what we're talking
about right now.

345
00:26:52.567 --> 00:26:54.047
Hey.Hello.

346
00:26:55.483 --> 00:26:57.006
Guess what
I brought?

347
00:26:57.616 --> 00:26:58.660
What?

348
00:26:58.704 --> 00:27:00.531
Fireworks for
Tess' birthday.

349
00:27:00.575 --> 00:27:02.621
It's a surprise
so don't say anything.

350
00:27:02.664 --> 00:27:04.318
Why are you doing
all this for her?

351
00:27:05.754 --> 00:27:07.974
I think you should
cut her some slack.

352
00:27:08.801 --> 00:27:10.803
This is a...

353
00:27:10.846 --> 00:27:13.327
It's a milestone
of a birthday.

354
00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:15.808
and I think that
she is a little nervous

355
00:27:15.851 --> 00:27:19.420
'cause... she thinks
that she should
be further along.

356
00:27:22.075 --> 00:27:23.685
I think
she would expect

357
00:27:23.729 --> 00:27:25.295
to be at Simon's
level right now.

358
00:27:25.339 --> 00:27:26.601
not that
she would admit that.

359
00:27:29.648 --> 00:27:30.649
Anyway.

360
00:27:31.693 --> 00:27:33.303
I thought we could
have a picnic

361
00:27:33.347 --> 00:27:35.262
at that little island
across the lake.

362
00:27:36.698 --> 00:27:38.657
Yeah. I don't want to be
in a boat with her right now.

363
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.136
Stop it.
it'll be fun.

364
00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:41.921
Sophie. I'm serious.

365
00:27:43.531 --> 00:27:44.575
Maybe this is

366
00:27:44.619 --> 00:27:45.838
just about
our friendship
not being

367
00:27:45.881 --> 00:27:47.709
what it
used to be.Whose friendship?

368
00:27:48.797 --> 00:27:50.103
Mine and Tess'.

369
00:27:54.629 --> 00:27:56.326
I don't think
you're being fair.

370
00:27:59.112 --> 00:28:01.418
Anyway.

371
00:28:01.462 --> 00:28:04.683
we all think
our worst thoughts
at night.

372
00:28:04.726 --> 00:28:07.642
You will not
think this way
in the morning.

373
00:28:21.525 --> 00:28:22.701
Andrea!

374
00:28:25.312 --> 00:28:26.835
Andrea!

375
00:28:30.621 --> 00:28:32.362
Andrea!

376
00:28:32.406 --> 00:28:35.322
I haven't
let the girls leave
the house in days.

377
00:28:35.365 --> 00:28:36.889
They're on
the verge
of mutiny.

378
00:28:38.934 --> 00:28:42.068
If she's hurt.
it's probably someone
she knows.

379
00:28:49.423 --> 00:28:50.729
Andrea!

380
00:28:52.861 --> 00:28:55.168
Andrea!

381
00:28:55.211 --> 00:28:57.910
Listen.
forget about the history.

382
00:28:57.953 --> 00:28:59.607
We talked about this
over and over.

383
00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:02.262
You've told me you can't be
your real self around them.

384
00:29:02.305 --> 00:29:04.307
When you've seen them.
do you have a good time
or not?

385
00:29:05.744 --> 00:29:07.093
Why do you
put yourself through this?

386
00:29:07.136 --> 00:29:08.747
Do you feel better or worse?

387
00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:10.792
And I think you already know
what you have to do.

388
00:29:10.836 --> 00:29:12.576
And there is
a really easy solution.

389
00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:15.666
you don't need them
in your life anymore.

390
00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:17.320
It's tough. I know it's tough.

391
00:29:17.364 --> 00:29:20.106
Part of growing up is
knowing when to let go.

392
00:29:25.285 --> 00:29:28.375
Hey. you missed
a really fun day.

393
00:29:28.418 --> 00:29:29.985
Hey. where were you?

394
00:29:30.029 --> 00:29:31.595
I went out with
one of the search parties.

395
00:29:31.639 --> 00:29:33.510
Hmm. Did
you find her?

396
00:29:35.034 --> 00:29:36.775
No.

397
00:29:36.818 --> 00:29:39.865
So. definitely worth
missing spending
the day with us. then.

398
00:29:39.908 --> 00:29:41.214
All right. I need
some help
at the wood shed.

399
00:29:41.257 --> 00:29:42.563
can you help me out?Mm-hmm.

400
00:29:42.606 --> 00:29:43.782
SOPHIE:
Thank you.

401
00:29:48.308 --> 00:29:49.788
Fuck me!

402
00:29:52.181 --> 00:29:54.357
Okay. lesson
number one.

403
00:29:54.401 --> 00:29:55.837
This is
a maul.

404
00:29:55.881 --> 00:29:57.883
I never want
to hear you call it
an ax. okay?

405
00:29:59.232 --> 00:30:01.582
So look for the
natural splits
in the wood.

406
00:30:01.625 --> 00:30:03.236
get your distance.

407
00:30:04.454 --> 00:30:06.195
Feet like so.Okay.

408
00:30:07.283 --> 00:30:08.371
And when
you swing.

409
00:30:08.415 --> 00:30:09.677
you want this hand
to fall in line

410
00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:11.461
with this hand.
So. like...

411
00:30:13.115 --> 00:30:14.334
Okay.

412
00:30:14.377 --> 00:30:15.683
Got it?Yeah.

413
00:30:18.425 --> 00:30:19.730
Wow. You're good.Well.

414
00:30:19.774 --> 00:30:21.341
that was
hardly anything.

415
00:30:21.384 --> 00:30:22.429
Okay.

416
00:30:24.823 --> 00:30:26.520
Nice.

417
00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.401
Shit.

418
00:30:39.489 --> 00:30:41.491
Alice? I think
we have enough.

419
00:30:41.535 --> 00:30:42.797
No. it's fine.

420
00:30:51.414 --> 00:30:52.851
Yeah.

421
00:30:52.894 --> 00:30:54.026
Thanks.

422
00:31:08.823 --> 00:31:11.521
You just pretend to be
this meek little victim.

423
00:31:11.565 --> 00:31:13.349
You sit there with this
placid look on your face.

424
00:31:13.393 --> 00:31:15.003
I'm here
trying to get through to you.

425
00:31:15.047 --> 00:31:18.441
I'm actually asking you
to do something.

426
00:31:18.485 --> 00:31:20.443
This is exactly what you do.
This is exactly what you do.

427
00:31:21.096 --> 00:31:22.402
I'm tired...

428
00:31:23.011 --> 00:31:24.099
of carrying you.

429
00:32:03.791 --> 00:32:05.532
♪ You say

430
00:32:08.578 --> 00:32:11.451

00:32:39.783 --> 00:32:43.178

00:32:43.222 --> 00:32:45.702

I did something wrong

438
00:32:45.746 --> 00:32:47.748

440
00:32:56.844 --> 00:32:58.019

00:32:59.629 --> 00:33:00.674
Come on.

442
00:33:02.415 --> 00:33:03.633
Come on.

443
00:33:04.504 --> 00:33:06.332
Come on.No. I don't want to.

444
00:33:10.031 --> 00:33:11.206
All right.

445
00:33:15.906 --> 00:33:16.995
Okay.

446
00:33:20.563 --> 00:33:21.825
Hey.

447
00:33:23.523 --> 00:33:24.741
I want you.

448
00:33:33.576 --> 00:33:37.624
Whoo!
All right!
Come on. Sophie!

449
00:33:37.667 --> 00:33:39.278
Tess!TESS:

450
00:33:39.321 --> 00:33:41.802
Good morning!SOPHIE: Tess.

451
00:33:41.845 --> 00:33:43.412
And then what
happens to your body.

452
00:33:43.456 --> 00:33:44.761
it goes into starvation mode

453
00:33:44.805 --> 00:33:47.112
and you feel
compelled to eat...

454
00:33:47.155 --> 00:33:49.114
But. like...
like. a super a lot.

455
00:33:49.157 --> 00:33:50.245
Super a lot. got it.

456
00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.923
You're gonna
give us diabetes.

457
00:34:15.966 --> 00:34:18.099
I'm making
cinnamon rolls.

458
00:34:18.143 --> 00:34:19.883
I can't do it
without sugar.

459
00:34:19.927 --> 00:34:21.624
You know it's
more addictive
than cocaine. right?

460
00:34:21.668 --> 00:34:23.496
Yeah. obviously.

461
00:34:23.539 --> 00:34:25.280
Cocaine isn't
even that good.

462
00:34:28.414 --> 00:34:30.416
You know.
I remember a time

463
00:34:30.459 --> 00:34:32.809
when you used
to like sugar.

464
00:34:32.853 --> 00:34:34.115
Yeah.

465
00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:35.638
There's just
all this research now

466
00:34:35.682 --> 00:34:37.814
on how it. like. corrodes
your organs and stuff. so.

467
00:34:38.815 --> 00:34:39.816
Hmm.

468
00:34:41.296 --> 00:34:42.254
What?

469
00:34:44.778 --> 00:34:47.172
I...

470
00:34:47.215 --> 00:34:49.870
I just know what
disordered eating
looks like.

471
00:35:01.795 --> 00:35:03.666
Is this better?Alice. what are you doing?

472
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:06.234
I mean. if you think
I should have more.
I can just keep going.

473
00:35:06.278 --> 00:35:07.975
Stop! Alice. stop!Is something wrong?

474
00:35:08.018 --> 00:35:09.846
I'm fine!
I'm fine!Stop. Alice!

475
00:35:21.641 --> 00:35:22.729
Hey. baby.

476
00:35:24.861 --> 00:35:26.559
Yeah. no. I can hear you.

477
00:35:26.602 --> 00:35:28.126
What's going on?

478
00:35:28.169 --> 00:35:30.563
I have no idea.

479
00:35:32.347 --> 00:35:33.522
...your friends.

480
00:35:33.566 --> 00:35:36.090
and that you're actually
at a cottage.

481
00:35:36.134 --> 00:35:38.136
So you... you lied to me.

482
00:35:38.832 --> 00:35:39.920
Yeah.

483
00:35:42.662 --> 00:35:43.750
No. I know.

484
00:35:43.793 --> 00:35:46.144
This is just classic bullshit.

485
00:35:46.187 --> 00:35:48.189
Like. why would you tell me

486
00:35:48.233 --> 00:35:49.582
that you're going on
a road trip when you...

487
00:35:49.625 --> 00:35:51.932
I don't know why. I know.

488
00:35:59.069 --> 00:36:00.070
Yeah.

489
00:36:01.463 --> 00:36:02.769
Yeah. okay.

490
00:36:03.683 --> 00:36:05.337
Yeah.
I love you.

491
00:36:08.209 --> 00:36:09.254
Who was that?

492
00:36:09.297 --> 00:36:12.474
Uh. just Simon.
He needs me.

493
00:36:12.518 --> 00:36:14.128
What? Why?You're kidding.

494
00:36:14.172 --> 00:36:15.956
No.What. he can't figure out

495
00:36:15.999 --> 00:36:17.566
how to turn the dishwasher on?

496
00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:19.742
When did he become
more important
to you than us?

497
00:36:19.786 --> 00:36:21.091
Jesus Christ. Tess!

498
00:36:21.135 --> 00:36:22.745
Not everything's
about you.

499
00:36:22.789 --> 00:36:24.443
Me? Are you serious?

500
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:32.668
I can't believe
she's talking
about leaving.

501
00:36:32.712 --> 00:36:34.017
Yeah.

502
00:36:34.061 --> 00:36:35.715
She could
have stayed
for my birthday.

503
00:36:35.758 --> 00:36:37.760
It's...
frustrating.

504
00:36:37.804 --> 00:36:39.371
We're having
a good time. right?

505
00:36:41.373 --> 00:36:42.983
When did she
become such a flake.

506
00:36:45.681 --> 00:36:46.856
I love you. Alice.

507
00:37:37.777 --> 00:37:39.082
Did you take my stuff?

508
00:37:40.693 --> 00:37:42.782
Cinnamon bun?Tess.

509
00:37:43.304 --> 00:37:44.740
What stuff?

510
00:37:44.784 --> 00:37:46.089
My phone and my wallet.
I know you have them. come on.

511
00:37:46.133 --> 00:37:47.874
Why would I take
your phone and your wallet?

512
00:37:47.917 --> 00:37:50.093
You know why.I want to hear you say it.

513
00:37:51.356 --> 00:37:53.836
Sophie went
to the store
and...

514
00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:55.882
hm. you and I need
some alone time.

515
00:37:55.925 --> 00:37:58.145
That's the last thing
that we need. man.

516
00:38:04.151 --> 00:38:05.370
Okay. come on.
You know me
better than that.

517
00:38:10.679 --> 00:38:11.985
I'll never
forgive you. just
so you know.

518
00:38:13.465 --> 00:38:14.596
I'll tell you
where they are

519
00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:17.207
if you come out
on the paddle board.

520
00:38:17.251 --> 00:38:18.948
Oh. my God.

521
00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:37.489
Should we
play a game?ALICE: Like what?

522
00:38:37.532 --> 00:38:39.447
Stand up.Why?

523
00:38:39.491 --> 00:38:40.840
Come on. it'll be fun.

524
00:38:51.241 --> 00:38:52.895
Come on.
fight back.

525
00:38:54.636 --> 00:38:56.246
Come on!

526
00:38:57.465 --> 00:38:58.727
Christ. Tess.

527
00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:10.913
Ugh!

528
00:39:10.957 --> 00:39:12.219
What is wrong with you?

529
00:39:12.262 --> 00:39:13.481
I didn't think
you were gonna fall in.

530
00:39:13.525 --> 00:39:14.917
You were sitting down.

531
00:39:17.355 --> 00:39:18.356
Can you help?

532
00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.013
Yeah. it's freezing!

533
00:39:36.678 --> 00:39:37.853
What?

534
00:39:40.247 --> 00:39:41.727
What?My earring!

535
00:39:42.554 --> 00:39:44.294
Fuck!Well. it's gone now.

536
00:39:44.338 --> 00:39:45.948
Simon gave me
those earrings.

537
00:40:02.138 --> 00:40:03.226
What are
you doing?

538
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:05.359
It's like
30 feet deep here.

539
00:40:05.403 --> 00:40:06.752
You can't
see shit
down there.

540
00:40:09.537 --> 00:40:10.495
Alice!

541
00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:12.061
Stop it.

542
00:40:14.281 --> 00:40:15.543
Alice!

543
00:40:17.806 --> 00:40:19.025
Alice!

544
00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:23.072
What are
you doing?

545
00:40:24.552 --> 00:40:27.120
I can't... I can't...

546
00:40:27.163 --> 00:40:28.251
I can't...Can't what?

547
00:40:28.295 --> 00:40:29.818
I can't do
another thing wrong.

548
00:40:29.862 --> 00:40:31.690
Fuck.Alice.

549
00:40:31.733 --> 00:40:33.169
I can't do
another thing wrong.

550
00:40:33.213 --> 00:40:35.737
Alice. what does
that even mean?

551
00:40:35.781 --> 00:40:38.392
No. I lied to him.
He doesn't even know
that I'm here.

552
00:40:38.436 --> 00:40:40.742
What?I mean. he does now.

553
00:40:40.786 --> 00:40:42.744
He called.

554
00:40:42.788 --> 00:40:44.442
Well. why did
you lie to him?

555
00:40:46.226 --> 00:40:48.446
Because I'm
bad.

556
00:40:48.489 --> 00:40:49.664
What?

557
00:40:55.627 --> 00:40:57.759
He wouldn't love
me if he knew
how bad I am.

558
00:41:01.807 --> 00:41:03.765
Jesus. is that something
that he tells you?

559
00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:12.295
You're such
a fucking cunt
sometimes.

560
00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:15.473
TESS:
Alice?

561
00:41:16.474 --> 00:41:17.649
Alice?

562
00:41:20.739 --> 00:41:22.915
Alice. is it?No! Just... no.

563
00:41:35.405 --> 00:41:36.537
Hey.

564
00:41:38.713 --> 00:41:40.759
Why do
you let him pull
this shit with you?

565
00:41:40.802 --> 00:41:43.849
He's not...
He's not
pulling anything.

566
00:41:43.892 --> 00:41:45.720
I lied to him. he has
every right to be angry.

567
00:41:45.764 --> 00:41:47.287
You lied?
About what?

568
00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:50.203
Just... about being here.

569
00:41:50.246 --> 00:41:51.900
Alice.
you can't tell

570
00:41:51.944 --> 00:41:53.598
your supposed life partner

571
00:41:53.641 --> 00:41:55.164
that you're going
to go on a trip with
your best friends

572
00:41:55.208 --> 00:41:57.297
and somehow
that's your fault.

573
00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:59.821
I can't think of a bigger
red flag than that.ALICE: It's not...

574
00:41:59.865 --> 00:42:01.431
Hey. can we
just approach this

575
00:42:01.475 --> 00:42:02.824
without
judgment?

576
00:42:02.868 --> 00:42:04.304
Are you seriously
telling me
that you have

577
00:42:04.347 --> 00:42:05.697
no opinions about this?

578
00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:07.873
Of course I do.
but Alice is
a grown woman.

579
00:42:07.916 --> 00:42:09.439
Yes! And I don't know
how any of this is

580
00:42:09.483 --> 00:42:10.876
your business.When you're friends

581
00:42:10.919 --> 00:42:12.094
with somebody.
it means you care

582
00:42:12.138 --> 00:42:13.269
about the other person.

583
00:42:13.313 --> 00:42:15.054
But I guess
that's a concept

584
00:42:15.097 --> 00:42:16.708
Simon managed
to erase from
your brain

585
00:42:16.751 --> 00:42:18.623
along with the rest
of your personality.Tess. stop it.

586
00:42:18.666 --> 00:42:20.059
Maybe this
is my personality

587
00:42:20.102 --> 00:42:21.495
and I'm changing.

588
00:42:21.539 --> 00:42:23.192
and you're the
shitty friend
for not. like.

589
00:42:23.236 --> 00:42:25.238
letting me
change. We're
not all content

590
00:42:25.281 --> 00:42:27.675
to. like. flip
between projects.

591
00:42:27.719 --> 00:42:29.459
Some of us have
real adult lives.

592
00:42:29.503 --> 00:42:31.853
Fucking a 40-year-old
does not make you an adult.

593
00:42:31.897 --> 00:42:33.028
He's 37.

594
00:42:33.072 --> 00:42:34.813
Yeah. he's a fucking clown.

595
00:42:34.856 --> 00:42:37.032
And he's got this stupid.
smarmy accent

596
00:42:37.076 --> 00:42:38.468
and his art is...

597
00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:42.429
self-indulgent.
derivative garbage.

598
00:42:42.472 --> 00:42:45.171
You're just jealous
because he's
successful and you're...

599
00:42:51.307 --> 00:42:52.526
I'm what?

600
00:42:53.745 --> 00:42:56.095
Simon loves me.
I'm happy.

601
00:42:58.532 --> 00:42:59.838
Is this what
you think love is?

602
00:42:59.881 --> 00:43:01.448
What would you know?
You've never been

603
00:43:01.491 --> 00:43:03.319
in a serious
relationship.

604
00:43:03.363 --> 00:43:06.148
Romantic love isn't
the only kind of love.

605
00:43:06.192 --> 00:43:07.889
Only boring people
think that.

606
00:43:07.933 --> 00:43:10.457
Okay. cool.
I guess I'm boring then.

607
00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:11.850
Well. I mean.
if the shoe fits.
I didn't say it.

608
00:43:11.893 --> 00:43:13.155
God. I can't
stand you
right now!

609
00:43:13.199 --> 00:43:14.156
I can't stand
you right now!

610
00:43:46.275 --> 00:43:52.412
Fuck. fuck. fuck.
fuck. fuck. fuck. fuck.

611
00:44:10.778 --> 00:44:12.345
Alice?

612
00:44:12.388 --> 00:44:14.216
Please. please go away.
Please go away.
Please go away.

613
00:44:15.087 --> 00:44:16.218
Please go.

614
00:44:17.698 --> 00:44:19.439
Please go.

615
00:44:19.482 --> 00:44:21.571
Alice?Please go away. please!

616
00:45:32.251 --> 00:45:33.731
Andrea!

617
00:45:36.734 --> 00:45:38.257
Andrea!

618
00:46:46.499 --> 00:46:47.805
Hello?

619
00:46:58.119 --> 00:46:59.338
Andrea?

620
00:49:22.176 --> 00:49:24.309
I'm assuming
you don't care
that I was worried.

621
00:49:33.318 --> 00:49:34.406
Can I come in?

622
00:49:36.147 --> 00:49:37.322
I guess.

623
00:49:53.816 --> 00:49:55.601
I made you a sandwich
in case you're hungry

624
00:49:55.644 --> 00:49:56.994
but don't want
to admit it.

625
00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:02.869
Thank you.

626
00:50:15.229 --> 00:50:17.014
Sophie's gone
looking for you.

627
00:50:17.057 --> 00:50:18.537
I think she's
pissed at us.

628
00:50:24.412 --> 00:50:25.892
I'm sorry
that I made you worry.

629
00:50:28.764 --> 00:50:29.896
You good?

630
00:50:35.336 --> 00:50:36.729
I don't want
to go home.

631
00:50:41.255 --> 00:50:42.387
Then we'll stay.

632
00:51:21.861 --> 00:51:23.123
Sophie back yet?

633
00:51:24.168 --> 00:51:25.125
No.

634
00:51:27.519 --> 00:51:29.086
This ax is a
piece of shit.

635
00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:31.523
That's
actually
a maul.

636
00:51:31.566 --> 00:51:32.654
Ugh. great.

637
00:51:34.352 --> 00:51:35.440
Thank you for that.

638
00:51:38.312 --> 00:51:39.618
"She felt very young.

639
00:51:39.661 --> 00:51:42.229
"and at the same time
unspeakably aged.

640
00:51:42.273 --> 00:51:44.971
"She sliced like a knife
through everything.

641
00:51:45.014 --> 00:51:48.453
"She had a perpetual sense
of being out. out.

642
00:51:48.496 --> 00:51:50.368
"far out to sea and alone.

643
00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:53.153
"She always had
the feeling that it was

644
00:51:53.197 --> 00:51:56.330
"very. very dangerous
to live even one day."

645
00:51:58.245 --> 00:52:00.465
I like you
reading me to sleep.

646
00:52:20.789 --> 00:52:22.487
You were gone a while.

647
00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:23.966
I needed some space.

648
00:52:24.489 --> 00:52:25.707
You know.

649
00:52:25.751 --> 00:52:28.188
this trip isn't
just about you.
Tess.

650
00:52:28.232 --> 00:52:29.711
You make me sound
like a bully.

651
00:52:30.103 --> 00:52:31.191
Well...

652
00:52:36.631 --> 00:52:37.632
I'm not a bully!

653
00:52:39.765 --> 00:52:41.636
Oh. my God. stop!

654
00:52:42.855 --> 00:52:44.422
Wow. Now that
is cleared up.

655
00:52:44.465 --> 00:52:45.901
who would
like a donut?

656
00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:50.384
Hot Chocolate?

657
00:52:50.428 --> 00:52:51.603
Yes. please.Yeah.

658
00:52:58.218 --> 00:53:00.655
How did Simon
know you were here?

659
00:53:00.699 --> 00:53:02.614
He looked at my email.

660
00:53:02.657 --> 00:53:04.181
He never would have
let me come.

661
00:53:04.224 --> 00:53:06.139
What?

662
00:53:06.183 --> 00:53:08.359
Yeah. he checks
things sometimes.

663
00:53:08.402 --> 00:53:09.925
Alice.

664
00:53:09.969 --> 00:53:12.101
I know.

665
00:53:12.145 --> 00:53:14.800
He always has a reason.

666
00:53:14.843 --> 00:53:16.715
I take my phone
into the bathroom
with me

667
00:53:16.758 --> 00:53:17.846
now when I shower.

668
00:53:17.890 --> 00:53:19.152
Andrea!

669
00:53:22.329 --> 00:53:24.113
Andrea!

670
00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:32.861
Andrea!

671
00:54:12.814 --> 00:54:14.903
I know
this sounds crazy.
but sometimes it feels like...

672
00:54:16.557 --> 00:54:18.255
like he can read my mind.

673
00:54:18.864 --> 00:54:20.648
and. like...

674
00:54:20.692 --> 00:54:22.128
if he can do that. then...

675
00:54:24.304 --> 00:54:26.915
there's nowhere left
that I can actually be alone.

676
00:54:29.875 --> 00:54:31.920
I never know what's
going to make him angry.

677
00:54:31.964 --> 00:54:34.575
so I spend all this time

678
00:54:34.619 --> 00:54:37.056
trying to be good.
trying to think of ways
to be better.

679
00:54:37.099 --> 00:54:39.754
Like if I could just
purify my thoughts.

680
00:54:44.672 --> 00:54:45.934
But you can't.
I mean...

681
00:54:48.546 --> 00:54:49.721
it's never good enough.

682
00:54:51.288 --> 00:54:52.941
I... I don't
know.

683
00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:57.859
But he doesn't hurt me
or anything. you know?

684
00:54:57.903 --> 00:54:59.731
He doesn't hurt you?

685
00:55:03.735 --> 00:55:05.911
I really wish
you would have
told us this sooner.

686
00:55:07.956 --> 00:55:09.218
I didn't know
what to say.

687
00:55:23.842 --> 00:55:26.932
♪ Happy birthday to you

688
00:55:29.064 --> 00:55:30.631
Happy birthday!

689
00:55:30.675 --> 00:55:31.850
Wow!

690
00:55:31.893 --> 00:55:33.852
Oh. you're
a wise old lady now.

691
00:55:33.895 --> 00:55:35.984
Uh. I have
always been
a wise old lady.

692
00:55:36.594 --> 00:55:37.769
In spirit. at least.

693
00:55:37.812 --> 00:55:40.554
Now you are
in body. too.Mm-hmm.

694
00:55:40.598 --> 00:55:42.687
I'm just gonna
go for it.

695
00:55:42.730 --> 00:55:44.819
Uh. I'm sorry.
but I don't think

696
00:55:44.863 --> 00:55:46.691
this is enough
chocolate chips.

697
00:55:46.734 --> 00:55:49.171
Whoa.Excuse me?

698
00:55:49.215 --> 00:55:50.825
Is this how you
treat people
on their birthday?

699
00:55:50.869 --> 00:55:53.654
That's a good
chip-to-pancake ratio.

700
00:55:53.698 --> 00:55:55.264
Oh. my God.

701
00:55:58.311 --> 00:55:59.573
We should go out tonight.

702
00:55:59.617 --> 00:56:01.445
Is there even
anything around here?

703
00:56:01.488 --> 00:56:03.403
Maybe the place
near the food mart.

704
00:56:03.447 --> 00:56:06.145
I just don't know if it's open
this early in the season.

705
00:56:07.233 --> 00:56:08.626
I could check
if I had my phone.

706
00:56:14.849 --> 00:56:15.981
Do you want it back?

707
00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:19.506
No.

708
00:56:19.550 --> 00:56:20.768
Not yet.

709
00:56:25.556 --> 00:56:27.253
What will he do
if he doesn't
hear from you?

710
00:56:30.517 --> 00:56:31.605
I'm not sure.

711
00:56:38.264 --> 00:56:39.613
I could text him

712
00:56:39.657 --> 00:56:41.528
and tell him
that you got
hit by a bus.

713
00:56:43.791 --> 00:56:45.663
Oh. my God. Tess.

714
00:57:18.130 --> 00:57:19.827
Oh. happy birthday!Happy birthday!

715
00:57:19.871 --> 00:57:21.046
Happy
Birthday!To me.

716
00:57:21.089 --> 00:57:22.221
To you!

717
00:57:27.444 --> 00:57:28.488
Oh. Jesus.

718
00:57:31.273 --> 00:57:32.361
Ugh!

719
00:58:47.175 --> 00:58:50.004
No. I...
I feel like I got one.

720
00:58:50.048 --> 00:58:51.310
Don't say that!

721
00:58:51.353 --> 00:58:53.834
No. in sympathy.
In sympathy.

722
00:58:53.878 --> 00:58:55.227
I don't really have one.

723
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:57.403
but I just need to pee
all the fucking time.

724
00:58:57.446 --> 00:58:59.884
Needing to pee
and having a UTI is not
the same thing.

725
00:58:59.927 --> 00:59:02.843
Yeah. it is!
It's like Cystitis and. like...

726
00:59:02.887 --> 00:59:05.106
Cystitis?ALICE: Oh. she's smart.

727
00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:06.455
I need to pee.

728
00:59:07.631 --> 00:59:08.893
So. you know.

729
00:59:10.111 --> 00:59:11.243
I...ALICE: Ugh.

730
00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:14.115

731
00:59:14.159 --> 00:59:15.769

Hmm. Simon thinks

754
01:00:40.419 --> 01:00:42.551
Nobody actually
thinks that.ALICE: He does.

755
01:00:43.248 --> 01:00:44.641
"Alice. that's enough...

756
01:00:44.684 --> 01:00:47.339

01:00:47.382 --> 01:00:50.168

01:00:59.133 --> 01:01:01.092
"You are going to get fat
if you keep eating like that."

761
01:01:25.725 --> 01:01:27.335
What. do I just
light it?

762
01:01:27.379 --> 01:01:28.510
This was your idea.

763
01:01:28.554 --> 01:01:29.947
That doesn't mean
I know how to do it.

764
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:31.775
Just.
I don't know. light
the string thing.

765
01:01:31.818 --> 01:01:33.037
This thing?ALICE: Yeah.

766
01:01:34.386 --> 01:01:36.431
Gosh.

767
01:01:38.738 --> 01:01:40.174
Oh. my God.

768
01:02:34.925 --> 01:02:37.405
I feel like garbage.

769
01:02:37.449 --> 01:02:40.234
You asked
the waitress
for birthday shots.

770
01:02:40.278 --> 01:02:42.454
Remember that drink
you used to make us?

771
01:02:42.497 --> 01:02:45.718
Which one?Gin and Smirnoff Ice.

772
01:02:46.371 --> 01:02:48.199
Ugh.

773
01:02:52.899 --> 01:02:54.945
Oh. that must
be egg guy.

774
01:02:54.988 --> 01:02:56.207
Egg guy?

775
01:02:56.250 --> 01:02:58.165
Oh. you should come.
He's guaranteed to have.

776
01:02:58.209 --> 01:03:00.385
like. a duck
or a kitten with him.

777
01:03:01.081 --> 01:03:02.561
I like cats.

778
01:03:06.695 --> 01:03:08.654
Oh.

779
01:03:20.753 --> 01:03:21.972
There's my girl.

780
01:03:29.109 --> 01:03:30.284
Missed you.

781
01:03:32.243 --> 01:03:33.853
I didn't know
you were coming.

782
01:03:33.897 --> 01:03:35.724
I've been calling
and calling.

783
01:03:35.768 --> 01:03:38.205
Well. the service
is pretty bad up here.

784
01:03:38.249 --> 01:03:39.859
Your Instagram feed
says otherwise.

785
01:03:42.906 --> 01:03:45.038
Well. I'm sure
Alice will explain
it all to me later.

786
01:03:52.306 --> 01:03:54.308
Jesus fucking Christ.

787
01:03:56.528 --> 01:03:58.269
Alice. will you
stop fussing?

788
01:03:58.312 --> 01:03:59.531
I can...

789
01:04:02.447 --> 01:04:03.752
It's...
It's fine.

790
01:04:07.234 --> 01:04:08.670
I guess I got too much. eh.

791
01:04:09.802 --> 01:04:11.586
I hope no one was
desperate for olives.

792
01:04:34.522 --> 01:04:37.351
This is kind
of a girls trip. Simon.

793
01:04:37.395 --> 01:04:39.832
We weren't
expecting you.

794
01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:43.749
What. are we telling
ghost stories?

795
01:04:43.792 --> 01:04:46.360
Alice was missing
me. so I thought
I'd swing by.

796
01:04:49.581 --> 01:04:50.582
Tess.

797
01:04:52.671 --> 01:04:54.281
And Sophie.Thanks.

798
01:04:58.807 --> 01:05:00.244
Your favorite.
my love.

799
01:05:00.287 --> 01:05:01.419
Thank you.

800
01:05:09.993 --> 01:05:11.168
Jeez. are you sure
you're not trying

801
01:05:11.211 --> 01:05:13.170
to give us
mad cow disease.
Simon?

802
01:05:15.389 --> 01:05:16.695
Would you like me
to put yours back on.

803
01:05:16.738 --> 01:05:18.001
Tess?It's fine.

804
01:05:18.044 --> 01:05:19.002
It's really
not a problem.It's fine.

805
01:05:25.312 --> 01:05:26.270
Sorry.

806
01:05:27.619 --> 01:05:28.968
Well. cheers.

807
01:05:34.713 --> 01:05:35.801
Cheers.

808
01:05:55.516 --> 01:05:57.127
I was pretty worried
about you

809
01:05:57.170 --> 01:05:58.563
when I didn't
hear back from you.

810
01:06:00.478 --> 01:06:02.393
You know. I heard about
the girl who went missing.

811
01:06:03.263 --> 01:06:04.656
Yeah.

812
01:06:04.699 --> 01:06:06.353
They didn't
find the guy
who killed her yet.

813
01:06:06.397 --> 01:06:08.355
Why would you
just assume
that she's dead?

814
01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:10.749
I'm not assuming.

815
01:06:19.714 --> 01:06:21.890
The checkout clerk
couldn't stop going
on about it.

816
01:06:47.438 --> 01:06:49.353
Um. I found...

817
01:06:49.396 --> 01:06:51.485
this thing
out of that cottage.

818
01:06:56.577 --> 01:06:57.752
It's just weird.

819
01:07:00.625 --> 01:07:02.888
It might be hers.
it might mean something.

820
01:07:02.931 --> 01:07:03.976
What. this?

821
01:07:05.804 --> 01:07:07.414
Alice. darling. I...

822
01:07:07.458 --> 01:07:09.068
I really don't think
anyone's gonna
care about this.

823
01:07:14.813 --> 01:07:16.032
No. probably not.

824
01:07:20.732 --> 01:07:21.733
You look different.

825
01:07:26.912 --> 01:07:29.306
She looks like herself.Mm-hmm.

826
01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:30.307
No. it's
the hair. I think.

827
01:07:35.399 --> 01:07:36.661
Yeah. it's very...

828
01:07:38.010 --> 01:07:39.098
bohemian.

829
01:07:45.104 --> 01:07:46.366
My beautiful girl.

830
01:08:20.357 --> 01:08:21.401
Hmm.

831
01:08:23.142 --> 01:08:25.623
You didn't tell me
you were living
in the lap of luxury.

832
01:08:31.150 --> 01:08:32.891
But then there's lots
of things you didn't
tell me.

833
01:08:34.458 --> 01:08:37.939
I mean. how are
we supposed to be
happy together

834
01:08:37.983 --> 01:08:39.376
if we can't trust
each other?

835
01:08:42.814 --> 01:08:45.121
Are you sorry
for what you did?

836
01:08:47.949 --> 01:08:51.214
It's completely
destabilizing

837
01:08:51.257 --> 01:08:52.737
when you do
shit like this.

838
01:08:52.780 --> 01:08:54.304
It derails my work.

839
01:08:54.347 --> 01:08:55.870
I know. I'm sorry.

840
01:08:55.914 --> 01:08:57.481
I just...
I...

841
01:08:57.524 --> 01:08:58.699
I'm trying to work out

842
01:08:58.743 --> 01:09:00.701
why you would choose

843
01:09:00.745 --> 01:09:02.355
to hurt me
so deliberately.I just... No.

844
01:09:02.399 --> 01:09:03.835
I...

845
01:09:03.878 --> 01:09:05.010
I mean. I just wanted

846
01:09:05.053 --> 01:09:06.490
to hang out
with my friends.Right.

847
01:09:06.533 --> 01:09:07.578
I wasn't...So you wanted to be here

848
01:09:07.621 --> 01:09:09.057
with them at my expense.

849
01:09:10.755 --> 01:09:12.235
You're incredibly
selfish.

850
01:09:25.161 --> 01:09:26.771
Come here.

851
01:09:31.515 --> 01:09:32.690
Come on.

852
01:09:42.961 --> 01:09:44.615
I haven't even
got to properly
kiss you yet.

853
01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:55.060
Just let me
brush my teeth.

854
01:11:41.732 --> 01:11:42.907
Should...

855
01:14:25.548 --> 01:14:26.810
Actually I need
to get up as soon

856
01:14:26.853 --> 01:14:27.941
as possible
in the morning

857
01:14:27.985 --> 01:14:29.160
so we can get
out of here.

858
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:33.164
I can't wait
to get home.

859
01:15:07.764 --> 01:15:08.808
You're leaving?

860
01:15:08.852 --> 01:15:10.680
Uh. I have to. Yeah.

861
01:15:10.723 --> 01:15:11.811
You know that.

862
01:15:36.227 --> 01:15:37.533
Be home soon.

863
01:15:39.143 --> 01:15:40.231
Ah...

864
01:15:47.847 --> 01:15:49.588
God. they
take themselves so
fucking seriously.

865
01:15:49.632 --> 01:15:50.894
don't they?

866
01:15:50.937 --> 01:15:52.199
Look at this guy.

867
01:15:53.070 --> 01:15:55.289
Come on. man.

868
01:15:55.333 --> 01:15:57.161
Maybe I should
get out and push.

869
01:16:02.427 --> 01:16:03.559
Sophie!

870
01:16:05.735 --> 01:16:06.779
SIMON:
What the fuck.

871
01:16:08.389 --> 01:16:09.434
What the fuck are you doing?

872
01:16:12.132 --> 01:16:13.873
Look what you've done
to my fucking car!

873
01:16:16.223 --> 01:16:18.312
What...

874
01:16:18.356 --> 01:16:19.705
What the...
What is wrong
with you?

875
01:16:24.841 --> 01:16:25.842
Alice.

876
01:16:27.234 --> 01:16:28.192
Alice. come on.
Get in the car.

877
01:16:31.369 --> 01:16:32.631
Alice.

878
01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:34.981
Alice.

879
01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:36.592
No.

880
01:16:43.686 --> 01:16:44.904
SIMON:
Jesus Christ.

881
01:16:47.428 --> 01:16:48.647
Come on. Mm.

882
01:16:49.561 --> 01:16:50.649
We should
get going.

883
01:16:51.607 --> 01:16:52.825
Let's just...

884
01:16:52.869 --> 01:16:54.740
Come on. put
the fucking ax down.

885
01:16:54.784 --> 01:16:56.568
It's a fucking
maul. Simon.

886
01:16:58.091 --> 01:17:00.790
Can you put
the maul down?

887
01:17:02.879 --> 01:17:03.923
Alice?

888
01:17:05.316 --> 01:17:06.839
I know
you're very
emotional.

889
01:17:07.884 --> 01:17:09.929
In fact.
I came
out here

890
01:17:09.973 --> 01:17:11.104
because I
was worried.

891
01:17:11.583 --> 01:17:12.802
She said no.

892
01:17:20.026 --> 01:17:21.027
Alice?

893
01:17:22.638 --> 01:17:23.813
Just... Hey.

894
01:17:24.988 --> 01:17:25.989
Hey.

895
01:17:27.904 --> 01:17:30.602
Alice. let's
just. uh...

896
01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:32.256
just take a breath.

897
01:17:32.299 --> 01:17:33.518
Just get in the car.

898
01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:35.041
Come home.

899
01:17:37.653 --> 01:17:38.915
You've
always said

900
01:17:38.958 --> 01:17:40.351
they don't really know you.

901
01:17:40.394 --> 01:17:41.657
You're so full
of shit.

902
01:17:45.399 --> 01:17:46.400
Alice.

903
01:17:47.967 --> 01:17:49.229
It's just...

904
01:17:50.970 --> 01:17:52.929
It's you and me.
come on.
It's just us.

905
01:17:54.234 --> 01:17:55.671
Let's go home.

906
01:17:55.714 --> 01:17:57.585
We can work
through this.

907
01:17:57.629 --> 01:17:59.631
I'm trying
to prove
I'm someone

908
01:17:59.675 --> 01:18:00.763
who really loves you.

909
01:18:02.547 --> 01:18:04.549
Let's just forget
about all of this.
it doesn't matter.

910
01:18:04.592 --> 01:18:06.072
She said no.

911
01:18:06.116 --> 01:18:08.553
Why don't you shut
your fucking mouth?

912
01:18:08.596 --> 01:18:10.947
And stay the fuck
out of this!

913
01:18:12.078 --> 01:18:13.210
Back off!

914
01:18:33.926 --> 01:18:34.927
It's okay.

915
01:19:15.446 --> 01:19:16.752
Fuck this.

916
01:19:24.629 --> 01:19:25.891
I give it a week.

917
01:19:54.398 --> 01:19:57.096
It's okay.
it's okay. it's okay.

918
01:20:27.387 --> 01:20:29.259
Sometimes I get a...

919
01:20:29.302 --> 01:20:31.565
a word or a saying
stuck in my head.

920
01:20:32.088 --> 01:20:33.263
Like a...

921
01:20:35.004 --> 01:20:37.093
phrase that keeps surfacing.

922
01:20:37.136 --> 01:20:39.225
and it will just repeat itself
again and again and again

923
01:20:39.269 --> 01:20:40.618
until it's all I can hear.

924
01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:46.842
And for a while.
it was this voice asking me...

925
01:20:49.018 --> 01:20:51.368
"What are the chances?

926
01:20:51.411 --> 01:20:53.239
"What are the chances?
What are the chances?"

927
01:20:54.762 --> 01:20:56.242
What are
the chances of what?

928
01:20:58.418 --> 01:21:00.116
Um. I don't
know. Maybe...

929
01:21:04.816 --> 01:21:07.210
what are the chances
I don't come out
on the other side?

930
01:21:08.951 --> 01:21:10.256
What are the chances
I don't want to?

931
01:21:17.785 --> 01:21:19.962
And lately.
it's. um...

932
01:21:23.269 --> 01:21:24.575
someone asking me.

933
01:21:24.618 --> 01:21:25.881
"Where will you
put your shame?

934
01:21:25.924 --> 01:21:27.186
"Where will you
put your shame?"

935
01:21:27.230 --> 01:21:28.753
And it's my voice.
but it isn't.

936
01:21:33.801 --> 01:21:35.194
You can
give it
to us.

937
01:21:37.022 --> 01:21:38.241
Here.

938
01:22:05.094 --> 01:22:06.356
Did it work?
