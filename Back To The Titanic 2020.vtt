Titanic.
the world's most famous ship.

4
00:00:09.076 --> 00:00:11.678
Sunk over 100 years ago

5
00:00:12.713 --> 00:00:15.048
and rediscovered in 1985.

6
00:00:16.617 --> 00:00:21.755
She fascinates like no other wreck
and still has secrets to reveal.

7
00:00:21.822 --> 00:00:24.925
There's sometimes about this story
that grips people.

8
00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:28.195
Everybody finds something
in this disaster.

9
00:00:28.262 --> 00:00:31.365
it's so varied and so all-encompassing.

10
00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.670
It's nearly 15 years
since anyone dived down to see Titanic.

11
00:00:37.538 --> 00:00:40.107
The world is anxious
to know what'shappened to her.

12
00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:43.208
There could be
a couple of major portions of the Titanic

13
00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:44.545
that might have collapsed.

14
00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:51.718
Now. a new expedition
is heading for the wreck site.

15
00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:53.053
Okay. good to go.

16
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.121
Good to go.

17
00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.526
World-leading experts
armed with state-of-the-art technology.

18
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.895
Let's send this bad boy to the bottom.

19
00:01:01.962 --> 00:01:04.898
It's a race against time
to answer questions...

20
00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:06.500
Okay. Tom. last check.

21
00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:07.968
Roger that.

22
00:01:09.203 --> 00:01:13.140
And preserve Titanic
for future generations...

23
00:01:13.207 --> 00:01:14.675
- Two minutes.
- Two minutes.

24
00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:16.410
Before it's too late.

25
00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:18.145
Let's go back to Titanic.

26
00:01:18.212 --> 00:01:20.214
Prepare to dive. Prepare to dive.

27
00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.762
Pressure Drop. all stations bridge.

28
00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.999
ETA over the wreck
is approximately 10 minutes from now.

29
00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:42.669
The team is arriving
at the Titanic wreck site.

30
00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:49.042
The ship lies three miles down in the icy
depths of the north Atlantic ocean.

31
00:01:58.118 --> 00:01:59.653
Okay. so. welcome. everyone.

32
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.788
We wanted to meet this afternoon

33
00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:06.293
to go over the dive plans
for the next two days. uh.

34
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.637
so you have two pieces of paper.

35
00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:10.497
The team gathers
to go over their mission.

36
00:02:10.564 --> 00:02:14.635
A plan to carry out a series of dives
to Titanic over the coming week.

37
00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:17.714
The first thing I'm gonna do
when I get down to the bottom is.

38
00:02:17.738 --> 00:02:19.578
as I mentioned. I'm gonna
just go thrusters off

39
00:02:19.606 --> 00:02:21.475
and I'm gonna see what the drift is.

40
00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:25.245
Victor Vescovo
has put this expedition together.

41
00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:28.015
There could be
a couple of major portions of Titanic

42
00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:29.416
that might have collapsed.

43
00:02:29.483 --> 00:02:31.163
Most people are very interested
in the bow.

44
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:33.120
because the bow is still quite discernible

45
00:02:33.187 --> 00:02:35.889
as the bow of the Titanic.
and I am hopeful

46
00:02:35.956 --> 00:02:40.694
that it hasn't significantly collapsed.
which would be unfortunate.

47
00:02:43.764 --> 00:02:48.468
Nobody has dived down to Titanic
in nearly 15 years.

48
00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:53.407
So. Victor's major concern is what may
have happened since she was last examined.

49
00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:57.811
From the first time this wreck was seen
in 1985. with each expedition.

50
00:02:57.878 --> 00:02:59.913
we've observed the condition of the wreck.

51
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.016
Victor has gathered
world-leading experts

52
00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:05.319
to ensure this mission is a success.

53
00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:08.956
including Titanic specialist.
Parks Stephenson.

54
00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:13.293
I've always seen the wreck as truly

55
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.063
the last surviving witness
to the disaster.

56
00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:17.731
almost like a crime scene.

57
00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:19.633
Well. that one will be fine.

58
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.437
I'm just gonna... I have to get dimensions
of the first platform that we have.

59
00:03:23.504 --> 00:03:26.039
but I'm pretty sure
that it won't fit in there.

60
00:03:26.106 --> 00:03:27.941
Microbial ecologist
Lori Johnston

61
00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:30.444
is another key member of the team.

62
00:03:30.511 --> 00:03:34.181
She's responsible for collecting
important data on the wreck's condition.

63
00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:39.953
From '98. I was able to dive
on Titanic. uh. six different times.

64
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.890
Uh. the last time
I personally saw it was 2005.

65
00:03:42.956 --> 00:03:46.860
So it'll be very interesting
to see the amount of deterioration.

66
00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:51.465
Okay. Roger that.
can you confirm the connectors?

67
00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:57.371
Okay. roger that.

68
00:03:57.437 --> 00:04:00.307
This is the deep submergence vehicle.
the Limiting Factor.

69
00:04:00.374 --> 00:04:04.244
It's the deepest diving submersible
in the whole world.

70
00:04:04.311 --> 00:04:08.348
and she is an absolute wonderful sub
and a beast.

71
00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:09.550
She is so tough.

72
00:04:10.517 --> 00:04:11.818
The Limiting Factor

73
00:04:11.885 --> 00:04:14.821
was specially designed by the team
for missions like this.

74
00:04:15.122 --> 00:04:17.758
Okay. Tom. last check.
we're gonna just have Tim.

75
00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:19.793
or maybe you can just
secure your own hatch.

76
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.429
Roger that. Securing hatch now.

77
00:04:22.496 --> 00:04:25.999
When Victor isn't piloting
the sub. Patrick Lahey will be.

78
00:04:26.066 --> 00:04:27.067
Okay. Tim.

79
00:04:27.134 --> 00:04:30.037
First thing is the pressure hull.
which is made of titanium.

80
00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:34.474
Hull's about 90 mm thick. which is
three and a half inches in thickness.

81
00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:37.077
and it has three view ports.

82
00:04:37.144 --> 00:04:40.647
Two that are on the top
looking out through the port

83
00:04:40.714 --> 00:04:43.083
and starboard sides
and then one lower view port

84
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.353
that gives you a great view
of the areas on the sea floor.

85
00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:49.523
- Good.
- Turning starboard.

86
00:04:55.896 --> 00:04:57.297
I mean. everything is so tight.

87
00:04:57.364 --> 00:04:59.132
you know. everything is in tight corners.

88
00:05:00.234 --> 00:05:04.905
The team's fitting the sub
with a super-high-resolution 4K camera.

89
00:05:04.972 --> 00:05:08.442
It's been specially commissioned
for this mission to film the wreck

90
00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:10.744
in the best definition possible.

91
00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:13.413
It's big. but delicate.

92
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.251
Having this camera here means that
we're gonna have to be very. very careful.

93
00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:20.487
It's gonna make it a lot more difficult
for the launch and recovery.

94
00:05:20.554 --> 00:05:23.323
and we're gonna have to be
really. really careful. Really careful.

95
00:05:26.393 --> 00:05:30.430
So the hazards are. you know.
we are going deep.

96
00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:33.567
and the fact that we're diving
around a human-made object.

97
00:05:33.634 --> 00:05:38.805
we're around a wreck structure
with potentially strong current.

98
00:05:40.407 --> 00:05:44.178
This wreck has been down there
for 107 years.

99
00:05:44.244 --> 00:05:47.080
so. uh. it's inherently unstable.

100
00:05:47.147 --> 00:05:49.550
and she lies across the current.

101
00:05:49.616 --> 00:05:52.786
uh. which is running
up to two knots at a time.

102
00:05:52.853 --> 00:05:57.224
Diving around a wreck presents
a unique set of risks and concerns.

103
00:05:57.791 --> 00:06:00.394
The primary one being entanglement.
you know.

104
00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.897
a wreck can have
things like ropes and obstructions

105
00:06:03.964 --> 00:06:07.534
and things of that nature
that present a hazard to the craft.

106
00:06:07.601 --> 00:06:12.606
The idea is to go here. and then we'll
come up here and pretty much. I mean.

107
00:06:12.673 --> 00:06:15.976
everyone has told me not to get too close
and to be extremely careful.

108
00:06:16.043 --> 00:06:17.811
because there are still wires.

109
00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:20.614
The success
of the first dive is vital.

110
00:06:20.681 --> 00:06:23.817
It will allow the team
to plot additional dives.

111
00:06:23.884 --> 00:06:26.920
Failure. and the expedition
could end abruptly.

112
00:06:28.155 --> 00:06:29.756
Cool. If no one's got any questions.

113
00:06:29.823 --> 00:06:36.396
then our next gig is 6:45
up on the foredeck. uh. tomorrow morning.

114
00:06:40.601 --> 00:06:43.971
Preparation is over.
Tomorrow. the team will attempt

115
00:06:44.037 --> 00:06:47.140
to dive to the most
famous ship in history.

116
00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:01.388
Weather conditions now are worse
than they were on the forecast yesterday.

117
00:07:04.625 --> 00:07:08.095
The first dive is due
to be launching in less than an hour.

118
00:07:11.532 --> 00:07:13.700
But conditions
aren't looking good.

119
00:07:14.635 --> 00:07:17.004
The crew's having to secure equipment.

120
00:07:17.638 --> 00:07:20.440
So. the biggest waves you can see
coming through now are probably four.

121
00:07:20.507 --> 00:07:23.911
four and a half meters.
which is pretty much double

122
00:07:23.977 --> 00:07:27.581
the maximum limit for the...
To operate the sub.

123
00:07:38.592 --> 00:07:39.760
So. you called it.

124
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.696
It's not a nice decision to make.
and no one wants to make it.

125
00:07:42.763 --> 00:07:45.899
- but it's the one that needs to be made.
- Yeah. I agree.

126
00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:47.467
And the people downstairs know?

127
00:07:51.104 --> 00:07:53.207
The first launch is aborted.

128
00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:58.212
If the bad weather doesn't pass soon.
the entire mission will be in jeopardy.

129
00:07:58.278 --> 00:08:00.714
Let's go down
and announce it to everybody.

130
00:08:09.022 --> 00:08:12.559
- Okay. good to go.
- Good to go.

131
00:08:12.626 --> 00:08:15.829
Next morning.
there's a break in the weather.

132
00:08:15.896 --> 00:08:17.197
Setting five minutes.

133
00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:19.366
Five minutes. okey-doke.

134
00:08:27.107 --> 00:08:28.375
The dive is on.

135
00:08:29.309 --> 00:08:31.245
We're going to the Titanic.

136
00:08:32.913 --> 00:08:33.914
Weather's not bad.

137
00:08:34.281 --> 00:08:37.093
It was rougher last night. I thought it
was gonna be rough this morning.

138
00:08:37.117 --> 00:08:38.385
but it's laid down a bit.

139
00:08:38.452 --> 00:08:40.320
so I'm comfortable with this.

140
00:08:40.387 --> 00:08:43.056
we can launch in this.
Let's send this bad boy to the bottom.

141
00:08:44.758 --> 00:08:49.196
This will be
the first ever solo dive to Titanic.

142
00:08:49.263 --> 00:08:51.031
- Two minutes.
- Two minutes.

143
00:09:01.008 --> 00:09:04.077
Good luck. Victor.
Say hello to the old girl.

144
00:09:04.144 --> 00:09:07.681
I will. Let's go back to Titanic.

145
00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:23.030
You're clear to dive. clear to dive.

146
00:09:23.096 --> 00:09:24.765
Roger that. LF is clear to dive.

147
00:09:24.831 --> 00:09:26.900
I've got a green board. pumps are now in.

148
00:09:35.976 --> 00:09:38.011
It will take Victor
one and a half hours

149
00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:39.780
to reach Titanic's depth.

150
00:09:40.647 --> 00:09:43.350
As you drop. light starts to fade.

151
00:09:43.517 --> 00:09:46.119
hazy greenish at first.
and then gives way to black.

152
00:09:46.186 --> 00:09:48.488
black. black. until it's pure black.

153
00:09:50.724 --> 00:09:52.526
There's nothing really much to see.

154
00:09:52.593 --> 00:09:54.561
So you descend into blackness.

155
00:10:02.669 --> 00:10:06.874
The wreck is nearly three miles
down where extreme water pressure

156
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.277
will push the sub and camera technology
to the very limit.

157
00:10:13.313 --> 00:10:18.252
Surface. LF.
present depth one one two zero.

158
00:10:18.318 --> 00:10:22.489
heading zero three seven.
life support good.

159
00:10:22.556 --> 00:10:26.927
Roger. LF. understand your depth
is one one two.

160
00:10:26.994 --> 00:10:30.430
4k cameras
have seldom filmed so deep before.

161
00:10:30.497 --> 00:10:34.668
and even if this one survives the journey.
what will be left to film?

162
00:10:43.677 --> 00:10:46.380
Surface. LF. present depth

163
00:10:46.446 --> 00:10:50.651
three eight zero eight at bottom.

164
00:10:51.018 --> 00:10:53.353
heading one eight zero.

165
00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:57.124
The first manned dive
in nearly 15 years is underway

166
00:10:57.191 --> 00:11:00.727
to the world's most famous ship. Titanic.

167
00:11:01.228 --> 00:11:06.366
If we arrive on site and the light
starts to reveal massive collapse.

168
00:11:06.433 --> 00:11:11.071
either like I'm predicting. or even worse.

169
00:11:11.138 --> 00:11:15.108
I'm sure there's gonna be
an instance of regret.

170
00:11:20.547 --> 00:11:23.817
Titanic was the most
luxurious liner in the world.

171
00:11:23.884 --> 00:11:27.855
When she set sail in April. 1912.
heading for New York.

172
00:11:27.921 --> 00:11:31.692
over 2.000 passengers and crew
were on board.

173
00:11:34.161 --> 00:11:39.233
Four days into her maiden voyage.
she it an iceberg and sank.

174
00:11:39.299 --> 00:11:42.369
Around 1.500 people lost their lives.

175
00:11:42.436 --> 00:11:45.739
There's something about this story
that grips people.

176
00:11:45.806 --> 00:11:50.143
The way the disaster played out.
the length of time that it played out.

177
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:54.882
allowing all these different human dramas
and different classes of people.

178
00:11:54.948 --> 00:11:58.118
everybody finds something
in this disaster.

179
00:11:58.185 --> 00:12:01.321
It's so varied and so all-encompassing.

180
00:12:07.394 --> 00:12:09.563
It looks like the edge
of something.

181
00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:11.665
This current keeps pushing me.

182
00:12:14.301 --> 00:12:18.405
Where Titanic rests
is incredibly dangerous.

183
00:12:18.472 --> 00:12:22.776
Strong currents swirl around the wreck.
making it extremely difficult

184
00:12:22.843 --> 00:12:25.512
for Victor to reach and film his target.

185
00:12:25.579 --> 00:12:27.481
I'm heading one eight zero.

186
00:12:27.548 --> 00:12:30.350
I'm being very careful.
I don't wanna run into anything.

187
00:12:38.058 --> 00:12:40.594
Where is it? I can't see it.

188
00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:47.301
There doesn't appear
to be anything here.

189
00:12:47.367 --> 00:12:49.403
I have a bad feeling about this.

190
00:12:57.878 --> 00:12:59.079
There we go.

191
00:13:00.747 --> 00:13:02.049
There she is.

192
00:13:06.787 --> 00:13:11.258
Oh. my gosh. I'm at the bow.
I'm at the bow of the Titanic.

193
00:13:22.035 --> 00:13:27.841
Surface. LF has gone to bow of Titanic.

194
00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:30.010
Bow of Titanic.

195
00:13:32.079 --> 00:13:33.080
Yeah.

196
00:13:35.015 --> 00:13:40.153
Just seeing the wreck
outside the view port. wow. amazing.

197
00:13:54.801 --> 00:13:57.638
Victor can now begin
the team's next objective.

198
00:13:57.704 --> 00:14:01.708
to film the wreck and collect data
to assess its condition.

199
00:14:06.747 --> 00:14:08.649
Coming up along the side here.

200
00:14:08.715 --> 00:14:14.421
I can see rust formations hanging
from the famous handrails.

201
00:14:14.955 --> 00:14:20.327
and there you can see
some of the A deck square windows.

202
00:14:23.096 --> 00:14:25.999
Victor pilots the sub
along the ship's exterior.

203
00:14:26.066 --> 00:14:29.536
Curtains of corrosion
can be seen envelopingport holes.

204
00:14:32.739 --> 00:14:38.445
When Titanic was first discovered in 1985.
she was in remarkable condition.

205
00:14:38.512 --> 00:14:42.282
but her stern and bow
were located 600 meters apart.

206
00:14:42.349 --> 00:14:44.852
having broken up on their descent.

207
00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:49.823
As Victor heads past the bow.
towards the stern.

208
00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:53.560
there's evidence
of human tragedy all around.

209
00:14:53.627 --> 00:14:55.829
Wow. the sea floor is just...

210
00:14:55.896 --> 00:14:58.599
It's littered with debris
from the ship breaking up

211
00:14:58.665 --> 00:15:00.734
as it descended through the water column.

212
00:15:00.801 --> 00:15:07.441
I can see tiles. some even intact bottles.
what looks to be crockery.

213
00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:13.046
There also seems to even be
a perfectly preserved pair of trousers.

214
00:15:19.786 --> 00:15:23.690
I think I'm approaching the stern.
I've got a big old sonar return.

215
00:15:27.194 --> 00:15:28.996
I see you on the sonar. girl.

216
00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:35.369
Can you see this? That's the stern.

217
00:15:36.737 --> 00:15:39.740
Wow. just savaged.

218
00:15:41.008 --> 00:15:45.279
Yeah. this is concerning.
there's jagged metal protruding

219
00:15:45.345 --> 00:15:51.051
almost from all directions.
and I can feel a strong current

220
00:15:51.118 --> 00:15:53.320
pushing me towards the wreckage sometimes.

221
00:15:57.991 --> 00:16:01.061
The dive has just become
much more dangerous.

222
00:16:10.904 --> 00:16:14.508
A deep-sea sub
is investigating the wreck of Titanic.

223
00:16:15.442 --> 00:16:17.744
Wow. just savaged.

224
00:16:18.545 --> 00:16:21.748
At the stern.
a powerful channel of fast-flowing water

225
00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:24.651
now jeopardizes the safety of the dive.

226
00:16:25.319 --> 00:16:29.556
I can feel a strong current
pushing me towards the wreckage sometimes.

227
00:16:30.524 --> 00:16:32.759
After several hours
fighting dangerous conditions.

228
00:16:33.694 --> 00:16:35.929
Victor decides
it's time to return to the surface...

229
00:16:36.763 --> 00:16:38.999
Surface. this is LF ascending.

230
00:16:39.066 --> 00:16:41.101
For the safety of the mission.

231
00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:45.172
I am exhausted.

232
00:17:08.395 --> 00:17:10.030
Hi.

233
00:17:13.333 --> 00:17:15.769
- Oh. finally. eh?
- Titanic. done.

234
00:17:17.938 --> 00:17:20.841
- Bow and stern.
- Good one. Good one.

235
00:17:21.275 --> 00:17:23.977
The dive is completed.
the sub's pulled in.

236
00:17:24.044 --> 00:17:26.413
but really my work starts now.

237
00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.349
Uh. all of the analysis work
that goes into the footage.

238
00:17:29.416 --> 00:17:32.419
I've got to try and get that done
and get things identified.

239
00:17:32.486 --> 00:17:35.289
so. um. it's gonna be
two busy days for me.

240
00:17:40.027 --> 00:17:42.596
In a way. it was the most difficult dive
I've ever done.

241
00:17:42.663 --> 00:17:46.600
simply because of the scale and the very
strong currents and visibility.

242
00:17:46.667 --> 00:17:48.068
So. it was very much

243
00:17:48.135 --> 00:17:52.406
diving into the unknown
and. uh. coming back with new information.

244
00:17:52.472 --> 00:17:54.675
The condition of the wreck
and. uh. you know.

245
00:17:54.741 --> 00:17:56.543
what had happened in the last 10 years.

246
00:17:58.445 --> 00:18:01.215
The first dive
has been a great success.

247
00:18:01.281 --> 00:18:04.318
it's revealed
Titanic is continuing to decay.

248
00:18:04.384 --> 00:18:06.420
but she's still intact.

249
00:18:06.486 --> 00:18:11.725
This new information is allowing the team
to begin the next phase of their mission.

250
00:18:11.792 --> 00:18:15.062
a more detailed forensic investigation.

251
00:18:15.128 --> 00:18:19.433
Yeah. that's A deck promenade.
and this is the B deck here.

252
00:18:19.499 --> 00:18:21.502
C deck port holes here.

253
00:18:21.568 --> 00:18:24.404
This is starboard side.

254
00:18:25.272 --> 00:18:29.676
Oh. this is badly corroded up here.
look at that. oh. it's gone.

255
00:18:29.743 --> 00:18:32.913
- What's gone?
- Right. look at A deck. right after...

256
00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:36.016
Titanic specialist Parks
is studying the footage

257
00:18:36.083 --> 00:18:37.885
to assess the state of the ship.

258
00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:40.988
- What collapsed? It's part of the...
- It's the A deck.

259
00:18:41.054 --> 00:18:42.756
By comparing the footage

260
00:18:42.823 --> 00:18:46.627
with images recorded
after Titanic was first found.

261
00:18:46.693 --> 00:18:51.398
he can see the bow is still recognizable.

262
00:18:51.465 --> 00:18:54.501
but the stern is showing greater break up.

263
00:18:54.568 --> 00:18:57.471
The stern was absolutely shattered
on impact.

264
00:18:57.538 --> 00:19:02.242
and so it is a mass of steel
and cables and fragments.

265
00:19:02.309 --> 00:19:05.045
and I don't think it's been properly
conveyed just how dangerous

266
00:19:05.112 --> 00:19:07.414
that area is and. frankly.
how unrecognizable.

267
00:19:12.486 --> 00:19:15.923
Strong currents
swirling around and eroding metal

268
00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:19.560
are partially responsible
for Titanic's deterioration.

269
00:19:19.626 --> 00:19:24.464
but experts think there is another reason
for the ship's uneven rate of decline.

270
00:19:25.966 --> 00:19:28.468
Titanic is unique

271
00:19:28.535 --> 00:19:32.539
in the fact
that it is dominated by bacteria.

272
00:19:35.075 --> 00:19:38.645
Microbial ecologist
Lori Johnston is one of the only people

273
00:19:38.712 --> 00:19:42.416
in the world who can fully understand
what is happening.

274
00:19:42.883 --> 00:19:46.086
On previous expeditions.
Lori investigated a phenomenon

275
00:19:46.153 --> 00:19:49.590
only seen on some of the deepest wrecks
in the world.

276
00:19:50.057 --> 00:19:53.060
Titanic is teeming with microscopic life.

277
00:19:53.994 --> 00:19:56.930
Titanic. obviously.
had bacteria when it went down.

278
00:19:57.264 --> 00:20:00.634
and they basically have become
the dominant organism.

279
00:20:03.737 --> 00:20:05.405
The bacteria thrive in areas

280
00:20:05.472 --> 00:20:08.542
where metal is damaged
like buckles or fractures.

281
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:12.813
It is here that rusticles first form.

282
00:20:13.313 --> 00:20:18.252
The term "rusticle" was sort of coined
when the Titanic was found.

283
00:20:18.318 --> 00:20:21.788
and it looks like rust-colored icicle.

284
00:20:21.855 --> 00:20:23.991
They're very sophisticated structures

285
00:20:24.057 --> 00:20:27.027
because they're made up
of microscopic organisms.

286
00:20:27.094 --> 00:20:30.531
So. when you put a rusticle
under the microscope.

287
00:20:30.597 --> 00:20:34.701
the features in them
are extremely detailed.

288
00:20:34.768 --> 00:20:38.839
These organisms have adapted
to eat metal and their feed rate

289
00:20:38.906 --> 00:20:43.210
looks set to intensify.
increasing the rate of decay.

290
00:20:43.744 --> 00:20:46.947
The bacteria themselves
seem to be increasing

291
00:20:47.014 --> 00:20:50.150
simply because there's nothing there
that can out-compete them

292
00:20:50.217 --> 00:20:54.421
and because there's so much steel there.
and they're just in their glory.

293
00:20:54.488 --> 00:20:57.391
taking out all of the elements
under the sea.

294
00:21:01.962 --> 00:21:05.065
This is a worrying discovery.

295
00:21:05.132 --> 00:21:07.034
but there is one advantage.

296
00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:11.271
the breakup allows the team
to see inside new areas of the wreck.

297
00:21:18.912 --> 00:21:21.481
I can show you how
I've put it together.

298
00:21:21.548 --> 00:21:24.751
which is. um. mainly using a process
called photogrammetry.

299
00:21:24.818 --> 00:21:29.556
so we've basically reconstructed the path
of the submarine.

300
00:21:34.895 --> 00:21:38.398
So. this is what
Victor was looking at on his first dive.

301
00:21:39.633 --> 00:21:43.737
The bow going down the starboard side.

302
00:21:50.377 --> 00:21:52.012
Ah. that's amazing.

303
00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:55.816
Creating this
scientifically accurate model

304
00:21:55.883 --> 00:21:57.818
is one of the team's core objectives.

305
00:21:58.218 --> 00:22:01.588
It's allowing Parks
to view Titanic from all angles.

306
00:22:01.655 --> 00:22:04.024
to see things in far greater detail

307
00:22:04.091 --> 00:22:08.128
than what is possible
from diving or studyingvideo footage.

308
00:22:08.195 --> 00:22:11.331
Oh. okay. rotate back around.
okay. and then bring it up.

309
00:22:11.398 --> 00:22:16.470
Okay. that's good. I mean.
oh. that is something else.

310
00:22:16.537 --> 00:22:20.908
Even this early in the process.
the model is allowing Parks to investigate

311
00:22:20.974 --> 00:22:24.745
stories from Titanic
in unprecedented detail.

312
00:22:24.811 --> 00:22:28.749
The way the 3D has rendered here
and has that corner...

313
00:22:28.916 --> 00:22:30.284
- Yeah.
- You really...

314
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:32.586
I mean. it really feels
like the ship here.

315
00:22:35.422 --> 00:22:40.327
On the night Titanic sank.
more than 2.000 passengers were onboard.

316
00:22:40.394 --> 00:22:42.429
The crew rushed towards the lifeboats.

317
00:22:42.496 --> 00:22:46.099
to be lowered into the water
using a small crane called the davit.

318
00:22:46.166 --> 00:22:50.404
On the model. Parks is intrigued
by one davit in particular.

319
00:22:52.139 --> 00:22:53.607
Right in this very area.

320
00:22:53.674 --> 00:22:58.078
uh. First Officer Murdoch
was desperately trying to load

321
00:22:58.145 --> 00:23:01.815
the last lifeboat into the davit.
so that it could be launched properly.

322
00:23:01.882 --> 00:23:04.184
You can see that this davit is cranked in.

323
00:23:04.251 --> 00:23:06.687
It's the only one on the wreck
that's like that.

324
00:23:06.753 --> 00:23:07.754
Right.

325
00:23:07.821 --> 00:23:11.225
Um.
that really supports the account

326
00:23:11.291 --> 00:23:15.462
that Murdoch was trying
to launch the last lifeboat

327
00:23:15.529 --> 00:23:18.198
when he and his crew
were swept away by the water.

328
00:23:20.334 --> 00:23:25.005
The photogrammetry has provided
vital evidence of the davit's position.

329
00:23:25.072 --> 00:23:28.976
proving that this lifeboat
was never launched.

330
00:23:29.042 --> 00:23:33.247
This really...
I mean. I can almost visualize the scene.

331
00:23:33.313 --> 00:23:38.018
seeing it in this lighting
and at this angle. So...

332
00:23:42.055 --> 00:23:45.692
That's just... That's. um...
That's pretty. uh. touching.

333
00:23:48.362 --> 00:23:51.064
There were
just 20 lifeboats in total.

334
00:23:51.131 --> 00:23:54.168
only enough
for around half the passengers.

335
00:23:57.604 --> 00:24:00.340
There's another personal
story related to Titanic

336
00:24:00.407 --> 00:24:03.577
that has fascinated Parks for years.

337
00:24:03.877 --> 00:24:08.182
It's connected to one
of the ship's mostfamous passengers.

338
00:24:08.248 --> 00:24:10.217
Benjamin Guggenheim.

339
00:24:10.284 --> 00:24:14.788
He was one of America's wealthiest
and most prominent businessmen.

340
00:24:14.855 --> 00:24:17.224
who was said
to have dressed up in his best

341
00:24:17.291 --> 00:24:19.726
and prepared to go down like a gentleman.

342
00:24:21.562 --> 00:24:24.731
This is what Guggenheim's state rooms
would have looked like.

343
00:24:24.798 --> 00:24:27.734
Titanic's most opulent living quarters.

344
00:24:29.369 --> 00:24:32.139
Located on the port side
at the point of destruction

345
00:24:32.206 --> 00:24:33.841
where the ship split in two.

346
00:24:36.009 --> 00:24:40.080
the state rooms were torn off
and fell to the sea floor.

347
00:24:41.481 --> 00:24:44.518
where they remain
to this day. undiscovered.

348
00:24:45.853 --> 00:24:49.790
Now. using the sub.
Parks is determined to find them.

349
00:24:58.966 --> 00:25:03.036
The free boat is engaged.
would you like me to engage surfacing?

350
00:25:03.103 --> 00:25:06.039
The team is preparing the sub
for the next dive

351
00:25:08.275 --> 00:25:11.745
to locate the remains
of Titanic's most opulent cabin.

352
00:25:11.812 --> 00:25:14.147
where one of the ship's
most famous passengers.

353
00:25:14.214 --> 00:25:17.551
Benjamin Guggenheim. spent his final days.

354
00:25:19.052 --> 00:25:20.921
I'm the only member of my family.

355
00:25:20.988 --> 00:25:25.893
going back to where
my great great grandfather last stood.

356
00:25:25.959 --> 00:25:28.829
So. there is something quite powerful
about that. I guess.

357
00:25:28.896 --> 00:25:31.465
and kind of getting closer
to the rest of the family

358
00:25:31.532 --> 00:25:34.768
and maybe paying one last homage.

359
00:25:35.302 --> 00:25:38.906
Sindbad is Benjamin Guggenheim's
great great grandson.

360
00:25:38.972 --> 00:25:41.475
He's joined the expedition
to discover more

361
00:25:41.542 --> 00:25:45.245
about the final hours
of his ill-fated relative.

362
00:25:45.312 --> 00:25:47.347
- Now. these are the decks...
- Oh. I see.

363
00:25:47.414 --> 00:25:50.450
They're laying on top of each other.
what you're seeing are the ribs

364
00:25:50.517 --> 00:25:52.095
that support the underside of the decks...

365
00:25:52.119 --> 00:25:54.855
- Right.
- And then it appears to be

366
00:25:54.922 --> 00:25:56.857
shell plating underneath.

367
00:25:56.924 --> 00:26:00.394
Previous expeditions
revealed an image that Parks thinks

368
00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:03.564
could be Guggenheim's missing state rooms.

369
00:26:03.964 --> 00:26:07.568
He wants to dive down
on the wreck to investigate further.

370
00:26:07.634 --> 00:26:10.337
Well. Parks is one of the world's
leading historians on the Titanic.

371
00:26:10.404 --> 00:26:13.774
and he's the kind of individual
that can look at a piece of wreckage

372
00:26:13.841 --> 00:26:17.077
and identify where it was on the ship
and why it's interesting.

373
00:26:18.312 --> 00:26:23.517
Each piece. its position.
its condition. tells a story.

374
00:26:29.223 --> 00:26:31.058
Parks also wants to record

375
00:26:31.124 --> 00:26:34.328
high-resolution footage
of some specific features on the bow

376
00:26:35.295 --> 00:26:37.564
to add to the photogrammetry model.

377
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.537
Once again. Victor will pilot the sub.

378
00:26:43.604 --> 00:26:45.839
Parks will join him to observe.

379
00:26:45.906 --> 00:26:48.809
I feel the need to go down there myself.

380
00:26:48.876 --> 00:26:52.079
owe it to those
who perished in the disaster.

381
00:26:52.446 --> 00:26:55.382
to maybe step out of the comfort zone
a little bit.

382
00:26:55.449 --> 00:27:00.988
take an acceptable amount of risk
and. um. experience it for myself.

383
00:27:01.989 --> 00:27:05.692
The sub will dive
to the wreck site. travel over the bow.

384
00:27:05.759 --> 00:27:07.961
then out across the debris field.

385
00:27:08.028 --> 00:27:10.764
searching for the mysterious piece
of metal.

386
00:27:14.935 --> 00:27:17.104
Here comes the water.
cap's on. are you ready?

387
00:27:17.171 --> 00:27:19.540
Yeah. Roger that. my hatch is secure.

388
00:27:19.606 --> 00:27:21.675
Roger that. hatch secure. Here we go.

389
00:27:21.742 --> 00:27:24.077
Roger that. I'm just gonna
put a little bit more on here.

390
00:27:24.144 --> 00:27:26.079
If Parks' theory is correct.

391
00:27:26.146 --> 00:27:31.151
it'll be an incredible discovery.
connecting a family across generations.

392
00:27:32.586 --> 00:27:35.422
Clear to go ahead
and start pumping.

393
00:27:35.489 --> 00:27:37.090
There goes the swimmer.

394
00:27:38.692 --> 00:27:39.760
LF. LF.

395
00:27:40.727 --> 00:27:42.162
This is the LF. go ahead.

396
00:27:42.896 --> 00:27:44.898
You're clear to. uh. start pumping.

397
00:27:44.965 --> 00:27:48.535
Roger that. the swimmer is clear.
I have armed thrusters.

398
00:27:48.602 --> 00:27:50.170
We're beginning to pump in now.

399
00:28:04.051 --> 00:28:06.386
The sub begins its long descent.

400
00:28:09.823 --> 00:28:11.225
Benjamin Guggenheim was born

401
00:28:11.291 --> 00:28:15.562
into a wealthy mining family
in Philadelphia in 1865.

402
00:28:17.965 --> 00:28:20.968
He was 47 years old when Titanic sank.

403
00:28:21.034 --> 00:28:24.204
leaving behind a wife
and three young daughters.

404
00:28:29.209 --> 00:28:34.548
Surface. LF. depth three eight zero five.
heading three one zero.

405
00:28:34.615 --> 00:28:38.519
life support good. wreck on sonar.

406
00:28:38.585 --> 00:28:42.523
Roger that. LF. understand. uh.
three eight zero five meters.

407
00:28:42.589 --> 00:28:45.359
heading three one zero degrees
with life support good

408
00:28:45.425 --> 00:28:47.794
and wreck on sonar. Congratulations.

409
00:28:47.861 --> 00:28:50.063
The sub has reached
the wreck site.

410
00:28:52.499 --> 00:28:56.069
Ha. it's murky. You can look
down there and see pretty well.

411
00:28:56.136 --> 00:28:57.538
I can see it. yeah.

412
00:28:59.673 --> 00:29:01.508
The visibility
is better looking down.

413
00:29:01.575 --> 00:29:03.610
- It is.
- There's the Marconi room.

414
00:29:03.677 --> 00:29:06.880
- one of the windows. one of the skylights.
- Let's see here.

415
00:29:06.947 --> 00:29:10.517
Before searching for the remains
of the Guggenheim state rooms.

416
00:29:10.584 --> 00:29:12.252
the team films additional footage

417
00:29:12.319 --> 00:29:15.589
of other important features
for later analysis.

418
00:29:15.656 --> 00:29:19.259
including the area
around the captain's quarters.

419
00:29:19.326 --> 00:29:21.795
Okay. I can barely see it.

420
00:29:21.862 --> 00:29:24.598
I can barely see it.
yeah. it's devastated.

421
00:29:24.665 --> 00:29:27.034
I see a glimpse of the tub.

422
00:29:34.908 --> 00:29:37.177
Next. the team
turns their attention

423
00:29:37.244 --> 00:29:39.346
to the search
for Guggenheim's state rooms.

424
00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:46.019
The debris field
is 15 square miles in size.

425
00:29:46.086 --> 00:29:51.191
Finding a single piece of metal is like
trying to find a needle in a haystack.

426
00:29:53.493 --> 00:29:54.761
Is this the bigger piece?

427
00:29:54.828 --> 00:29:57.731
- No. it's not the bigger piece.
- What is this?

428
00:29:57.798 --> 00:29:59.967
I don't think
it's Guggenheim either.

429
00:30:03.937 --> 00:30:07.307
Parks is searching
for specific structural features

430
00:30:07.374 --> 00:30:10.377
that coincide with
the state room's location aboard the ship.

431
00:30:10.911 --> 00:30:15.649
This is key to confirming the identify
of the mystery object in the image.

432
00:30:19.786 --> 00:30:21.906
We're getting close to something
up there on the left.

433
00:30:22.055 --> 00:30:24.458
- Yep.
- 40 meters.

434
00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:29.463
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.
eyes out. eyes out. eyes out.

435
00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:30.697
Okay.

436
00:30:33.967 --> 00:30:36.336
This might be the Guggenheim piece.

437
00:30:37.471 --> 00:30:39.873
- You see all that ribbing?
- Yeah.

438
00:30:42.409 --> 00:30:44.178
This might be the Guggenheim piece.

439
00:30:44.244 --> 00:30:47.014
- I'm gonna translate left.
- Please. translate left. yes. please.

440
00:30:50.951 --> 00:30:52.853
Yeah. here we go. this is it.

441
00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.722
This is it. this is Guggenheim's
state room. right here.

442
00:30:58.792 --> 00:31:00.594
- Right along here.
- Found it.

443
00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:05.532
That's the state room right there.

444
00:31:05.599 --> 00:31:07.167
That's Guggenheim.

445
00:31:09.636 --> 00:31:11.538
Good job. Teamwork.

446
00:31:14.408 --> 00:31:18.278
Surface to LF. present depth
three eight zero two.

447
00:31:18.345 --> 00:31:20.647
life support good. at Guggenheim.

448
00:31:20.714 --> 00:31:23.250
Roger. LF. at Guggenheim.

449
00:31:23.317 --> 00:31:24.518
Congratulations.

450
00:31:31.091 --> 00:31:32.359
Turn off the flow.

451
00:31:32.426 --> 00:31:33.427
Roger that.

452
00:31:34.061 --> 00:31:36.430
The search is over
for the remains

453
00:31:36.496 --> 00:31:38.866
of Benjamin Guggenheim's state rooms.

454
00:31:44.671 --> 00:31:46.740
I can't believe you found it.

455
00:31:46.807 --> 00:31:48.842
The odds of this were astronomical.

456
00:31:49.409 --> 00:31:54.014
but. um. it just so happened in this case.

457
00:31:54.081 --> 00:31:58.752
your great great grandfather's state room
was situated in an area

458
00:32:00.087 --> 00:32:03.390
that had identifiable features. um...

459
00:32:03.457 --> 00:32:07.261
Yes. the odds were astronomical.

460
00:32:11.298 --> 00:32:15.569
That... That chaos is really
what's. uh. for me.

461
00:32:15.636 --> 00:32:18.805
uh. really. the most traumatizing.
I think. you know.

462
00:32:18.872 --> 00:32:21.432
when you're there. when you see this
and everything. it's just...

463
00:32:21.575 --> 00:32:22.943
It's just very powerful.

464
00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:25.012
One thing it does show. that at the end.

465
00:32:25.078 --> 00:32:27.814
it did not matter what class
you were from. they all died equally.

466
00:32:27.881 --> 00:32:29.716
Exactly. yeah. Absolutely.

467
00:32:32.486 --> 00:32:37.291
In those rare instances
where we can provide identification

468
00:32:37.357 --> 00:32:43.263
of a piece to a descendant
of someone who perished.

469
00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:45.799
I think it's very much appreciated.

470
00:32:46.667 --> 00:32:49.870
We all like to remember those.
like. fairy tales of him.

471
00:32:49.937 --> 00:32:51.805
uh. dressed in his best. as he said.

472
00:32:51.872 --> 00:32:55.475
sipping brandy
and just going down heroically.

473
00:32:55.542 --> 00:32:59.479
I guess. but. yeah. what I'm seeing here.

474
00:32:59.546 --> 00:33:01.715
like the crushed metal and everything.

475
00:33:01.782 --> 00:33:04.084
is just showing me
a very different reality.

476
00:33:12.159 --> 00:33:15.062
Finding Guggenheim's
state rooms allows the team

477
00:33:15.128 --> 00:33:18.932
to add another crucial part
to their photogrammetry model.

478
00:33:21.068 --> 00:33:23.904
And then we're coming up now to the top.

479
00:33:23.971 --> 00:33:26.240
Okay. there's the overhang from A deck.

480
00:33:26.306 --> 00:33:28.542
Additional data
from the most recent dive

481
00:33:28.609 --> 00:33:30.577
has now been added to the model.

482
00:33:30.644 --> 00:33:33.680
It's allowing Parks to understand
other areas of Titanic

483
00:33:33.747 --> 00:33:35.215
in far more detail...

484
00:33:35.282 --> 00:33:38.652
It took us a while to recognize this.

485
00:33:39.019 --> 00:33:42.322
Including the cabin
of Captain Edward John Smith.

486
00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:45.792
who famously went down with his ship.

487
00:33:47.227 --> 00:33:50.631
When Titanic was rediscovered in 1985.

488
00:33:50.697 --> 00:33:55.903
the contents of Captain Smith's bathroom
were revealed to be largely intact.

489
00:33:55.969 --> 00:33:58.138
including his private bathtub.

490
00:33:59.773 --> 00:34:04.244
It's a tiny. but very tangible.
detail of the lives of individuals

491
00:34:04.311 --> 00:34:06.880
who lived and worked aboard the ship.

492
00:34:07.814 --> 00:34:10.083
So Parks wants to see how it's faring.

493
00:34:11.185 --> 00:34:16.023
This entire overhead has now collapsed
since we last saw it.

494
00:34:16.089 --> 00:34:22.062
Only a small sliver
of the captain's bath tub remains.

495
00:34:22.129 --> 00:34:29.036
This collapse was exactly the kind of. uh.
failure that we were expecting to find.

496
00:34:29.102 --> 00:34:31.772
and I expect this kind of collapse

497
00:34:31.839 --> 00:34:36.310
is gonna continue in various areas
around the wreck in the years to come.

498
00:34:38.378 --> 00:34:41.748
The captain's quarters
have lost their battle with decay.

499
00:34:45.986 --> 00:34:47.087
You can see...

500
00:34:47.154 --> 00:34:50.224
Next. Parks turns his attention
to another area of the ship

501
00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:53.460
that's of great interest.
the Marconi room.

502
00:34:55.128 --> 00:34:57.431
As the biggest and best ship of her day.

503
00:34:57.497 --> 00:35:00.634
Titanic contained
state-of-the-art technology.

504
00:35:00.701 --> 00:35:04.638
including the famous
Marconi radio transmitter.

505
00:35:04.705 --> 00:35:08.208
The set aboard Titanic was among
the first of its kind ever built.

506
00:35:11.512 --> 00:35:14.515
It was housed in the Marconi room.
located on the boat deck

507
00:35:14.581 --> 00:35:16.817
between the first and second funnels.

508
00:35:18.785 --> 00:35:20.087
The transmitter was used

509
00:35:20.153 --> 00:35:24.224
to receive warnings of icebergs
and send distress messages.

510
00:35:24.291 --> 00:35:28.629
something ships hadn't been able to do
until the end of the 19th century.

511
00:35:28.695 --> 00:35:32.466
My biggest fear
is my favorite part of the wreck.

512
00:35:32.533 --> 00:35:34.468
the Marconi wireless telegraph room.

513
00:35:34.535 --> 00:35:39.339
is gone and any hope of recovering that
transmitting apparatus and restoring it

514
00:35:40.474 --> 00:35:44.411
is no longer...
Is no longer a possibility.

515
00:35:48.081 --> 00:35:51.218
On a previous expedition.
Parks saw the Marconi room

516
00:35:51.285 --> 00:35:53.520
and its contents were in good condition.

517
00:35:53.587 --> 00:35:56.056
Now. he wants to view
its current state in detail.

518
00:35:56.123 --> 00:35:59.993
as he couldn't see it clearly
during his dive with Victor.

519
00:36:02.196 --> 00:36:05.265
I wanna go in here. I wanna see
what that is. I wanna get in here.

520
00:36:05.332 --> 00:36:08.402
I can actually see rusticles
hanging down inside.

521
00:36:08.468 --> 00:36:10.804
so that indicates
there's a whole space in here.

522
00:36:12.673 --> 00:36:15.742
Parks is hoping
the photogrammetry will allow him

523
00:36:15.809 --> 00:36:18.078
to see the Marconi room
in far greater detail.

524
00:36:19.513 --> 00:36:22.749
The area that I'm interested in
is right in this area right here.

525
00:36:22.816 --> 00:36:25.219
- Now. your data set falls off here...
- Yeah.

526
00:36:25.285 --> 00:36:30.090
But. um. these holes right here
are of special concern to me

527
00:36:30.157 --> 00:36:32.860
because this looks like
the beginning of...

528
00:36:32.926 --> 00:36:35.996
- Now. now. pull out a little bit.
- Sure.

529
00:36:36.063 --> 00:36:38.999
The three-dimensional
photogrammetry is revealing

530
00:36:39.066 --> 00:36:42.302
a new depression
in the roof of the Marconi room.

531
00:36:42.402 --> 00:36:43.737
It's gonna continue to fall.

532
00:36:43.804 --> 00:36:45.964
and there's gonna be...
And next time we come out here.

533
00:36:46.006 --> 00:36:48.208
there's gonna be a new
hole next to that one.

534
00:36:49.142 --> 00:36:53.080
We are definitely
in a race against time here.

535
00:37:00.888 --> 00:37:03.790
An investigation
into the condition of Titanic

536
00:37:03.857 --> 00:37:06.260
is revealing a mixed picture.

537
00:37:06.693 --> 00:37:09.563
Some of the wreck's
features have deteriorated...

538
00:37:09.696 --> 00:37:12.599
- I see a glimpse of the tub.
- Yeah.

539
00:37:12.666 --> 00:37:14.968
I can barely see it.
and. yeah. it's devastated.

540
00:37:15.569 --> 00:37:17.638
Whilst others have barely changed.

541
00:37:17.738 --> 00:37:22.409
Overall. the wreck seems to be
holding up surprisingly well.

542
00:37:22.476 --> 00:37:27.514
There are some areas of concern.
advanced deterioration.

543
00:37:27.714 --> 00:37:31.251
and. uh. we're going to be
assessing those going forward.

544
00:37:31.318 --> 00:37:34.121
uh. to try and get better
predictions on how much longer

545
00:37:34.188 --> 00:37:35.722
the wreck will be with us.

546
00:37:39.092 --> 00:37:41.762
We wanted to take this moment
to remember those

547
00:37:41.828 --> 00:37:45.465
that have. uh. perished
the night that Titanic sank.

548
00:37:45.532 --> 00:37:48.702
As the expedition
enters its final stages.

549
00:37:48.769 --> 00:37:51.772
the team is honoring Titanic's victims.

550
00:37:51.839 --> 00:37:54.508
And. um. we'll take a moment's silence.

551
00:38:11.358 --> 00:38:15.229
With the ceremony complete.
the team preparesfor their next dive.

552
00:38:15.295 --> 00:38:17.631
It's a good opportunity to think

553
00:38:17.698 --> 00:38:20.501
about the site itself
and to start planning the dive.

554
00:38:20.567 --> 00:38:25.839
I wanted to go beyond the dive.
uh. to talk about a science program

555
00:38:25.906 --> 00:38:28.008
about the permanent conditions.

556
00:38:28.642 --> 00:38:33.113
The dive will help the team
understand andpredict Titanic's future.

557
00:38:34.014 --> 00:38:36.650
They've taken a number
of different types of metal.

558
00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:41.989
and then they've subjected
them to different kinds of. uh. activity.

559
00:38:42.055 --> 00:38:44.858
Some of them have been subject to torsion.

560
00:38:44.958 --> 00:38:48.028
uh. some of them have been
heat-treated with a welder.

561
00:38:48.095 --> 00:38:49.229
some have been riveted.

562
00:38:49.396 --> 00:38:52.065
Some... So. they're trying to replicate

563
00:38:52.132 --> 00:38:55.135
all the different kinds of metal
that you might find on a ship

564
00:38:55.202 --> 00:38:57.204
and then subjecting it
to the sort of forces

565
00:38:57.271 --> 00:38:59.306
that a ship in distress might suffer.

566
00:39:01.542 --> 00:39:04.845
The team wants to place
the data platformnext to the wreck.

567
00:39:06.046 --> 00:39:09.616
It's a non-invasive
but scientific way to record decline.

568
00:39:11.018 --> 00:39:14.755
The platform is made of steel.
just like Titanic.

569
00:39:14.821 --> 00:39:17.858
The bacteria will start populating
that steel source.

570
00:39:17.925 --> 00:39:21.895
so then we can bring that up
after X number of years.

571
00:39:21.995 --> 00:39:23.830
it's considered a long-term experiment.

572
00:39:24.331 --> 00:39:27.868
and analyze it to. again. correlate that

573
00:39:27.935 --> 00:39:30.370
back to the deterioration rate
of the wreck.

574
00:39:34.274 --> 00:39:37.477
You can see the very obvious
manipulator arm. that's very powerful.

575
00:39:37.544 --> 00:39:40.848
but it can function all the way down
to full ocean depth.

576
00:39:42.416 --> 00:39:44.451
The sub's
manipulator arm will be used

577
00:39:44.518 --> 00:39:46.820
to place the steel platform
on the sea floor.

578
00:39:47.521 --> 00:39:49.990
but doing this. 3 miles down. in the dark

579
00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:53.126
and with strong currents. won't be easy.

580
00:39:53.193 --> 00:39:55.229
It'll be a challenge.
there's no doubt about it.

581
00:39:55.295 --> 00:39:57.497
but. um. I'm up for the challenge.

582
00:39:57.564 --> 00:40:00.133
- Good luck. guys.
- Thanks. Victor.

583
00:40:03.003 --> 00:40:05.806
Kelvin is going
to be operating the manipulator arm.

584
00:40:08.375 --> 00:40:10.811
And for this dive.
Patrickis piloting the sub.

585
00:40:13.814 --> 00:40:16.450
- You got her?
- Yep. Bring this bad boy down.

586
00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:23.056
The sub will be supported
by a remotely controlled lander

587
00:40:23.156 --> 00:40:26.460
that will safely transport
the data platform to thesea floor.

588
00:40:26.894 --> 00:40:29.263
You've got three swimmers below.

589
00:40:29.329 --> 00:40:31.064
you can start to pump and dive.

590
00:40:31.431 --> 00:40:33.867
Roger that. Turning pumps on now. Okay?

591
00:40:33.934 --> 00:40:35.402
- Yep.
- Okay.

592
00:40:46.446 --> 00:40:50.150
Having arrived at the wreck.
the team preparesto release the platform.

593
00:41:00.494 --> 00:41:04.531
But. at this depth. just the simplest
of actions isfraught with difficulty.

594
00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:11.171
Looking good.

595
00:41:14.408 --> 00:41:18.245
The next task
is to drop the platformin a safe place.

596
00:41:18.312 --> 00:41:22.015
as close to the wreck as possible
sorusticles can latch on.

597
00:41:23.483 --> 00:41:25.419
Yeah. so bring it
down to the ground here.

598
00:41:26.486 --> 00:41:27.721
Is that close enough?

599
00:41:29.456 --> 00:41:30.591
Looks pretty close.

600
00:41:31.859 --> 00:41:33.460
Here. let me
get the arm going again.

601
00:41:43.103 --> 00:41:44.471
Yeah. yeah. Yep.

602
00:41:44.638 --> 00:41:47.407
How about that?

603
00:41:51.512 --> 00:41:54.248
When the platform
is retrievedin years to come.

604
00:41:54.314 --> 00:41:57.150
on a new expedition.
the rusticles captured

605
00:41:57.217 --> 00:41:59.753
will be vital in predicting
Titanic's future.

606
00:42:05.425 --> 00:42:10.197
The team's mission is complete.
and the first manned dives to Titanic

607
00:42:10.264 --> 00:42:13.467
in nearly 15 years have come to an end.

608
00:42:16.837 --> 00:42:18.906
Thanks very much. Frank.
for getting us back.

609
00:42:24.244 --> 00:42:27.281
The expedition has led
to the creation of the most accurate

610
00:42:27.347 --> 00:42:30.083
photogrammetry model
of the wreck ever built.

611
00:42:42.496 --> 00:42:45.766
Titanic as no one has seen her before.

612
00:42:50.871 --> 00:42:55.142
And now she's beginning
a new life as anartificial reef.

613
00:42:56.310 --> 00:42:59.847
Home to an abundant
and diverse array ofmarine creatures.

614
00:43:01.415 --> 00:43:04.084
Honestly. there's more life on Titanic now

615
00:43:04.151 --> 00:43:07.020
than there was
when she was floating on the surface.

616
00:43:09.423 --> 00:43:13.193
But. in time.
as Titanic's decline continues.

617
00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:15.062
she will becomeunrecognizable.

618
00:43:15.729 --> 00:43:18.599
There's lots of
varying opinions on Titanic.

619
00:43:18.665 --> 00:43:21.368
Is there any way thatwe can preserve it?

620
00:43:21.435 --> 00:43:27.107
But. I sometimes feel that people
miss the point of the recycling aspect.

621
00:43:27.174 --> 00:43:31.311
This is a natural process.
It was built through iron ore.

622
00:43:31.378 --> 00:43:34.882
uh. and the earth is reclaiming
that iron ore from Titanic.

623
00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:39.319
It's a shipwreck
that's returning to nature.

624
00:43:39.386 --> 00:43:43.757
but that doesn't mean
that we're done exploring Titanic yet.

625
00:43:43.824 --> 00:43:46.927
This deterioration has now
opened up new possibilities

626
00:43:46.994 --> 00:43:48.395
to learn more about the wreck.

627
00:43:51.498 --> 00:43:56.170
We went down there to look.
to document. and to assess.

628
00:43:56.236 --> 00:44:00.274
The results of this expedition
wildly exceeded our expectations.
