00:00:10.662 --> 00:00:12.099
Wait. wait. wait. wait. wait.
Under the stairs.

4
00:00:12.186 --> 00:00:13.796
Under the stairs.
Under the stairs.

5
00:00:45.088 --> 00:00:46.176
Hey. here.

6
00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:48.396
Here.

7
00:00:52.574 --> 00:00:53.923
Number check!

8
00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:55.620
Four!

9
00:00:55.751 --> 00:00:56.795
Three!

10
00:00:56.882 --> 00:00:58.319
Ah. Mila's in the lead.

11
00:00:58.449 --> 00:00:59.581
Five.

12
00:00:59.668 --> 00:01:00.799
Come here you.

13
00:01:00.886 --> 00:01:03.324
-Show-off.
-Go get ready.

14
00:01:03.454 --> 00:01:04.934
My babies.

15
00:01:09.112 --> 00:01:10.331
Morning.

16
00:01:10.418 --> 00:01:12.550
So. today's the day. right?

17
00:01:12.681 --> 00:01:14.248
Thank you.

18
00:01:14.378 --> 00:01:17.425
Yeah. today's the day
I completely humiliate myself

19
00:01:17.512 --> 00:01:19.166
in front of every colleague
I have.

20
00:01:19.253 --> 00:01:21.646
Oh. so you didn't forget.

21
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:25.433
Listen. they are going
to love it.

22
00:01:25.563 --> 00:01:26.999
Don't worry.

23
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.871
Everything about those
two sentences

24
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:31.700
that you just said.
tells me I horribly failed

25
00:01:31.787 --> 00:01:34.746
at depicting both
an accurate portrait of my job.

26
00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:37.532
And the vampires who make it
a living hell.

27
00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.533
Stop it.

28
00:01:39.621 --> 00:01:41.710
You are a marketing genius.

29
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.841
Do you hear me?

30
00:01:42.928 --> 00:01:44.408
And today's the day.

31
00:01:44.495 --> 00:01:48.064
that these vampires
are gonna realize it.

32
00:01:48.151 --> 00:01:49.718
Now you're placating.

33
00:01:49.805 --> 00:01:51.241
Is it working?

34
00:01:51.328 --> 00:01:53.330
-A little bit.
-Oh.

35
00:01:55.941 --> 00:01:57.639
Ready.

36
00:01:57.769 --> 00:01:59.684
Wha... whoa!

37
00:01:59.771 --> 00:02:02.034
And with seven minutes
to spare.

38
00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:03.514
Hoorah!

39
00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:06.213
Hey. so here's what
I'm thinking.

40
00:02:06.343 --> 00:02:08.389
Maybe we head outside
and throw football around.

41
00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.086
while we wait for these
slowpokes to catch up.

42
00:02:10.217 --> 00:02:12.219
-Duh!
-Duh. of course.

43
00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.264
Come on. let's go buddy.

44
00:02:14.351 --> 00:02:15.526
Love you guys.

45
00:02:15.657 --> 00:02:16.484
Love you.

46
00:02:31.847 --> 00:02:35.416
Ooh. okay.

47
00:02:35.503 --> 00:02:36.417
Hmmm.

48
00:02:48.211 --> 00:02:49.343
Hello?

49
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.052
Morning!

50
00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:04.096
Jesus. Owen!

51
00:03:04.227 --> 00:03:05.794
Sorry.

52
00:03:05.924 --> 00:03:07.361
- Oh. my goodness.
- I didn't mean to scare you.

53
00:03:07.491 --> 00:03:09.406
Did you sleep here last night?

54
00:03:09.493 --> 00:03:10.712
Tish and I got
into another fight.

55
00:03:10.842 --> 00:03:12.540
and... I hope you don't mind.

56
00:03:14.498 --> 00:03:17.458
Well. I guess someone ought
to use these beds.

57
00:03:17.545 --> 00:03:19.503
- You scared me.
- Sorry.

58
00:03:19.634 --> 00:03:21.026
You scared me.

59
00:03:21.113 --> 00:03:22.724
Oh my goodness.

60
00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:27.555
You can't avoid me forever.

61
00:03:27.642 --> 00:03:29.165
If you don't fix this.

62
00:03:29.296 --> 00:03:31.428
I will make sure you never work
in this town again.

63
00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:33.561
And you know how few calls
that will take.

64
00:03:33.648 --> 00:03:35.127
I never had these problems

65
00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:37.521
when your dad
was in charge of my account.

66
00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:40.611
Okay.

67
00:03:40.698 --> 00:03:42.134
You can do this.

68
00:03:42.265 --> 00:03:43.788
You are confident.

69
00:03:43.918 --> 00:03:45.355
You are fierce.

70
00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.055
You are a complete coward.

71
00:04:02.154 --> 00:04:06.289
Tony. you know I love you.
and those big meaty fingers.

72
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.813
But when I say gently.
please interpret that as.

73
00:04:08.944 --> 00:04:10.206
if anything arrives
in less than mint condition.

74
00:04:10.293 --> 00:04:11.512
I will hunt you down.

75
00:04:11.642 --> 00:04:13.470
and destroy everything good
in your life.

76
00:04:13.601 --> 00:04:14.384
Capisce?

77
00:04:18.954 --> 00:04:20.260
-Ah.
-Thanks.

78
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.349
I see you uh.
packed your sass today.

79
00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.177
Always.

80
00:04:25.308 --> 00:04:27.528
Oh my goodness.
so how did it go with uh.

81
00:04:27.615 --> 00:04:28.616
with the jeans guy?

82
00:04:28.746 --> 00:04:29.530
Oh gosh!

83
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.314
I had to cut the cord.

84
00:04:31.401 --> 00:04:33.751
What? Why?

85
00:04:33.882 --> 00:04:36.537
Uh. he wanted us to go
jogging together

86
00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:39.061
on a Sunday at 7:00 a.m.

87
00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:41.977
Desi. you know you could
have just said no. right?

88
00:04:42.107 --> 00:04:44.022
Ah. the mere suggestion
tells me that

89
00:04:44.153 --> 00:04:46.808
he's operating
on a fatal dose of delusion.

90
00:04:46.938 --> 00:04:48.288
and mama don't want
a cautionary tale.

91
00:04:49.854 --> 00:04:51.900
But you know. enough about me.
How are you?

92
00:04:51.987 --> 00:04:53.771
How's the assistant search
going?

93
00:04:53.858 --> 00:04:56.948
I feel like I am throwing myself
down a never-ending staircase.

94
00:04:57.079 --> 00:04:58.602
-Oh.
-The last girl I asked.

95
00:04:58.733 --> 00:05:00.169
why she was interesting
in staging.

96
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.040
and she started talking
about musicals--

97
00:05:02.171 --> 00:05:04.216
That she did in high school.

98
00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:05.609
Hey. I dated
a musical theatre nerd

99
00:05:05.696 --> 00:05:06.828
once by mistake.

100
00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.221
and he told me
I needed to reel it in.

101
00:05:09.352 --> 00:05:10.440
while we were hooking up

102
00:05:10.527 --> 00:05:11.746
in his creepy uncle's
Ford Focus.

103
00:05:11.833 --> 00:05:13.835
because I was upstaging him.

104
00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.186
Oh. ah. side note.

105
00:05:17.273 --> 00:05:18.230
I might have run
a little overkill

106
00:05:18.361 --> 00:05:19.362
on forklift Phil.

107
00:05:19.493 --> 00:05:21.321
so if comes claiming
emotional damage.

108
00:05:21.451 --> 00:05:23.105
you know.
it might be a tad valid.

109
00:05:23.235 --> 00:05:25.412
You have to be nicer to people.

110
00:05:25.542 --> 00:05:28.110
I'll try. but you
and I both know the reason

111
00:05:28.197 --> 00:05:29.416
why you hired me
as lead decorator.

112
00:05:29.503 --> 00:05:31.722
is because I'm a gorgeous

113
00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:33.681
and intimidating
dragon whisperer.

114
00:05:33.768 --> 00:05:36.031
and intimidate I shall.

115
00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:37.554
How about you intimidate
Kyle Morgan?

116
00:05:37.685 --> 00:05:40.557
Because he has called me
at least 10 times.

117
00:05:40.688 --> 00:05:42.342
Sorry. boo.
he only wants to talk to you.

118
00:05:42.472 --> 00:05:44.735
Oh. I don't know
how my dad did this.

119
00:05:44.822 --> 00:05:45.954
It's been seven months.

120
00:05:46.041 --> 00:05:46.824
You'll find your legs.

121
00:05:46.955 --> 00:05:49.523
You're an amazing decorator.

122
00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.701
Being a boss. an owner.
is a completely different beast.

123
00:05:55.398 --> 00:05:57.922
Hey. I'm home.

124
00:05:58.009 --> 00:05:59.141
Where are the kids?

125
00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:04.886
What-- what's wrong?

126
00:06:05.016 --> 00:06:06.191
There was a court hearing today.

127
00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:10.239
Gavin's biological mom
wants him back.

128
00:06:10.326 --> 00:06:13.895
Terrence. the adoption
is almost final.

129
00:06:14.025 --> 00:06:15.462
He's been with us--

130
00:06:15.592 --> 00:06:18.203
They want us to drop him off
at the school and--

131
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.248
And what?

132
00:06:20.728 --> 00:06:21.903
And what?

133
00:06:23.165 --> 00:06:24.558
And that's it.

134
00:06:24.645 --> 00:06:26.168
She'll pick him up after.

135
00:06:26.255 --> 00:06:27.561
Then we fight.

136
00:06:27.691 --> 00:06:29.998
The state wants him
with his mom.

137
00:06:30.085 --> 00:06:31.521
I am his mother.

138
00:06:31.608 --> 00:06:32.957
I know.

139
00:06:33.044 --> 00:06:34.655
They cannot take him away
from me.

140
00:06:36.134 --> 00:06:37.440
-That is our child.
-I know. I know. I know.

141
00:06:37.571 --> 00:06:38.702
No. stop.

142
00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:40.443
It's not okay!

143
00:07:18.786 --> 00:07:20.309
Why are you staring?

144
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.137
Oh. ju--

145
00:07:22.267 --> 00:07:24.095
Just looking at you.

146
00:07:24.226 --> 00:07:25.445
Thinking about how much
I love you.

147
00:07:26.881 --> 00:07:28.404
Go back to sleep.

148
00:07:28.491 --> 00:07:29.318
You're weird.

149
00:07:32.277 --> 00:07:33.975
It's what mamas do.

150
00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.647
Gavin! Mila!

151
00:07:53.777 --> 00:07:54.778
Can you come here. please?

152
00:08:04.962 --> 00:08:06.790
Hey.

153
00:08:06.877 --> 00:08:08.096
Oh.

154
00:08:10.141 --> 00:08:12.404
Before we get started.
your mother and I

155
00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:13.667
wanna have a quick chat
with you.

156
00:08:15.233 --> 00:08:16.844
We love you guys so much.

157
00:09:33.094 --> 00:09:35.226
Our foster son was returned
to his birth mother.

158
00:09:35.313 --> 00:09:36.184
and we're devastated.

159
00:09:39.753 --> 00:09:41.145
Shower time.

160
00:09:41.276 --> 00:09:42.059
In a minute.

161
00:09:46.063 --> 00:09:47.587
Mila. shower!

162
00:09:47.674 --> 00:09:48.979
Now!

163
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:49.893
Sure. dad.

164
00:10:01.949 --> 00:10:03.646
She seems to be doing
a lot better.

165
00:10:03.777 --> 00:10:05.735
Yeah.

166
00:10:05.866 --> 00:10:07.911
Children are resilient.

167
00:10:17.181 --> 00:10:21.055
Hey. it's only been three weeks.

168
00:10:21.142 --> 00:10:22.143
Gotta give yourself a break.

169
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.407
Baby. I just see him.

170
00:10:25.494 --> 00:10:26.930
I see him everywhere.

171
00:10:28.497 --> 00:10:29.933
It's like this house
felt like a home.

172
00:10:30.064 --> 00:10:30.847
when it was the four of us.

173
00:10:30.934 --> 00:10:33.110
Hey. hey. hey--
Now. it just--

174
00:10:33.197 --> 00:10:34.590
It'll feel like a home again.

175
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:37.985
Maybe.

176
00:10:39.377 --> 00:10:40.814
Baby. maybe we should try again.

177
00:10:42.163 --> 00:10:43.904
Seriously?

178
00:10:43.991 --> 00:10:44.992
Yeah.

179
00:10:48.212 --> 00:10:51.128
You know what Dr. Horgan said?

180
00:10:52.739 --> 00:10:55.437
But listen.
that was two years ago.

181
00:10:55.567 --> 00:10:57.178
Maybe my body just needed rest.

182
00:10:57.265 --> 00:10:58.788
Don't you want another one?

183
00:10:58.875 --> 00:10:59.876
Of course. I do.

184
00:11:00.007 --> 00:11:01.791
I just...

185
00:11:01.878 --> 00:11:04.359
You didn't see the pain
in your eyes that--

186
00:11:04.489 --> 00:11:08.102
the constant defeat over
and over again.

187
00:11:08.232 --> 00:11:09.494
And I had to feel it.

188
00:11:11.148 --> 00:11:13.107
That's not fair.

189
00:11:13.194 --> 00:11:14.935
You're right.

190
00:11:15.065 --> 00:11:16.284
I'm sorry.

191
00:11:18.503 --> 00:11:20.375
I just...

192
00:11:20.462 --> 00:11:21.811
I can't watch you go through
that again.

193
00:11:21.898 --> 00:11:22.856
I won't.

194
00:11:31.168 --> 00:11:33.214
I just know that there's a void
in our family

195
00:11:33.301 --> 00:11:34.911
that I have to try to fill.

196
00:11:38.523 --> 00:11:41.004
Hey. we'll get through this.
okay?

197
00:11:41.091 --> 00:11:42.179
I don't wan to get through it.

198
00:11:43.354 --> 00:11:44.573
I want to solve it.

199
00:12:01.546 --> 00:12:02.722
Terrence?

200
00:12:19.173 --> 00:12:20.435
You-- you good?

201
00:12:20.522 --> 00:12:22.132
No. I think I heard
someone scream.

202
00:12:22.219 --> 00:12:23.525
Please help me!

203
00:12:23.655 --> 00:12:25.048
-Someone. please!
-See!

204
00:12:25.135 --> 00:12:26.397
-Stay here.
-Okay.

205
00:12:35.363 --> 00:12:37.539
Who is it?

206
00:12:37.626 --> 00:12:39.019
Thank God. please.
you have to let me in!

207
00:12:39.106 --> 00:12:40.760
I'm running away
from my boyfriend.

208
00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:42.544
He just threatened to kill me
and I didn't know what to do!

209
00:12:42.674 --> 00:12:44.024
If he finds me.
I swear he'll kill me. please...

210
00:12:45.939 --> 00:12:46.940
Oh.

211
00:12:48.332 --> 00:12:49.725
Oh my God! That's him!

212
00:12:49.812 --> 00:12:50.900
Please. I'm begging you.
you have to let me in.

213
00:12:50.987 --> 00:12:52.510
Okay.

214
00:12:52.597 --> 00:12:53.555
Just go around back.
the gate's unlocked. alright?

215
00:12:53.642 --> 00:12:54.599
Okay. thank you.

216
00:12:56.036 --> 00:12:57.559
Wait. wait. What is going on?

217
00:12:57.646 --> 00:12:58.603
I don't know.

218
00:12:58.734 --> 00:13:00.127
What do you mean
you don't know?

219
00:13:07.221 --> 00:13:09.310
Come on. out!

220
00:13:09.397 --> 00:13:11.747
Come out. come out.
wherever you are.

221
00:13:11.834 --> 00:13:14.010
Just. just wait.

222
00:13:14.097 --> 00:13:14.924
You don't see her?

223
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.101
Where did she go?

224
00:13:18.232 --> 00:13:19.973
I don't see her.

225
00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:21.322
Please. I need some help.

226
00:13:23.498 --> 00:13:25.195
Okay.

227
00:13:25.326 --> 00:13:27.241
I need you to stay right here.
okay?

228
00:13:27.371 --> 00:13:28.982
-I'm gonna call the police.
-No. no. no. no.

229
00:13:29.069 --> 00:13:29.939
He'll know you called them
and he'll find me.

230
00:13:30.026 --> 00:13:32.289
He'll find me.

231
00:13:32.376 --> 00:13:34.509
Okay. okay. okay. come here.
Come here. come here. come here.

232
00:13:34.596 --> 00:13:37.120
Okay. you just are in shock.

233
00:13:37.207 --> 00:13:38.730
Just calm down. You're safe now.

234
00:13:38.861 --> 00:13:39.862
-You have a safe place to be.
-Wait. wait. wait!

235
00:13:39.949 --> 00:13:41.777
-What?
-Hang on.

236
00:13:41.908 --> 00:13:43.518
Are you insane?

237
00:13:43.648 --> 00:13:44.649
She could be lying.

238
00:13:44.736 --> 00:13:45.868
Look at her face.

239
00:13:45.955 --> 00:13:47.957
She's terrified.

240
00:13:48.088 --> 00:13:50.394
Then I'll take her to a shelter.
to the hospital. to a--

241
00:13:50.525 --> 00:13:51.831
No. no. you have got
to stay here with Mila.

242
00:13:51.918 --> 00:13:53.702
What if whoever that is
comes back?

243
00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:54.659
It's crazy.

244
00:13:54.746 --> 00:13:56.618
We have no idea who she is.

245
00:13:56.705 --> 00:13:59.447
Baby. she is pregnant.

246
00:13:59.577 --> 00:14:01.275
And she needs our help.

247
00:14:02.493 --> 00:14:03.451
Please.

248
00:14:06.497 --> 00:14:08.195
Baby?

249
00:14:08.325 --> 00:14:10.023
-You take the pepper spray.
-I got it.

250
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:12.155
And make sure that your location
tracker is on.

251
00:14:12.242 --> 00:14:13.461
It's already on.

252
00:14:13.548 --> 00:14:14.549
-Go.
-Okay.

253
00:14:14.679 --> 00:14:15.506
Come on. come on. come on.
Come on!

254
00:14:15.637 --> 00:14:16.507
Come with me. Come with me.

255
00:14:16.638 --> 00:14:17.552
Are you okay?

256
00:14:17.639 --> 00:14:18.858
Come on. come on.

257
00:14:31.827 --> 00:14:33.481
So. you don't have any friends.
any family?

258
00:14:33.611 --> 00:14:34.699
Anyone that I could call?

259
00:14:34.786 --> 00:14:36.353
No.
Not for a couple thousand miles.

260
00:14:36.484 --> 00:14:37.572
Okay. okay. There is a...

261
00:14:37.702 --> 00:14:38.790
there is a hotel not too far
from here.

262
00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:40.662
I'll take you there.

263
00:14:40.749 --> 00:14:42.664
We were on our way to Florida.

264
00:14:42.751 --> 00:14:44.361
Wait.

265
00:14:44.448 --> 00:14:45.667
Wait. wait. wait. That's him!
That's him. That's him.

266
00:14:45.754 --> 00:14:47.060
Duck down. duck down. duck down.

267
00:14:56.199 --> 00:14:57.766
It's okay. He's gone.
You can get up.

268
00:15:00.203 --> 00:15:01.596
I promise everything
will be alright.

269
00:15:03.293 --> 00:15:04.251
It'll be okay.

270
00:15:05.817 --> 00:15:07.254
Oh my goodness.

271
00:15:14.304 --> 00:15:16.480
Okay. we are here.

272
00:15:16.611 --> 00:15:17.829
I'll pay for the room.

273
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.179
Don't worry about it.

274
00:15:20.789 --> 00:15:22.704
Why are you being so nice to me?

275
00:15:22.791 --> 00:15:25.533
I'm a mom. you're a mom.

276
00:15:25.663 --> 00:15:27.709
And you have enough
on your plate right now.

277
00:15:29.972 --> 00:15:32.670
Um. can I ask you a question?

278
00:15:32.801 --> 00:15:34.194
Of course.

279
00:15:34.324 --> 00:15:37.240
You-- you said that he
threatened to kill you.

280
00:15:37.327 --> 00:15:38.328
Why?

281
00:15:39.982 --> 00:15:41.244
And I'm sure that two bottles

282
00:15:41.331 --> 00:15:42.942
of whiskey in his system
didn't help.

283
00:15:44.378 --> 00:15:48.338
Alcoholics don't just
dull their pain.

284
00:15:48.469 --> 00:15:50.906
They dull the lives of everyone
around them.

285
00:15:50.993 --> 00:15:53.996
Which is why I created a profile

286
00:15:54.083 --> 00:15:56.520
on an independent
adoption site.

287
00:15:56.651 --> 00:15:59.567
And why he went...

288
00:15:59.654 --> 00:16:02.700
He went absolutely mental.
which doesn't even make sense.

289
00:16:02.831 --> 00:16:04.702
'cause it's not like
he's the father. but...

290
00:16:04.833 --> 00:16:06.269
Have you told the father

291
00:16:06.356 --> 00:16:07.923
that you're putting the baby
up for adoption?

292
00:16:09.055 --> 00:16:10.795
No.

293
00:16:10.882 --> 00:16:14.234
He uh. he died.

294
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.454
Oh.

295
00:16:17.541 --> 00:16:19.543
In a car accident
a few months ago.

296
00:16:19.674 --> 00:16:21.502
I-- I am so sorry.

297
00:16:24.374 --> 00:16:26.159
He was the best person I knew.

298
00:16:28.639 --> 00:16:31.338
We started dating
in eighth grade.

299
00:16:32.861 --> 00:16:34.689
Mrs. Wheeler's science class.

300
00:16:38.214 --> 00:16:41.000
We wanted to go to Florida
and get season passes to Disney.

301
00:16:43.176 --> 00:16:45.004
That's um...

302
00:16:45.091 --> 00:16:47.745
That's where I'm headed
after all of this.

303
00:16:47.876 --> 00:16:50.009
I have cousins that live
by the water.

304
00:16:51.184 --> 00:16:52.750
It's nothing fancy.

305
00:16:52.881 --> 00:16:55.797
but I think it'll be
a good place to start over.

306
00:16:57.364 --> 00:16:58.843
After I say goodbye.

307
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:02.847
He deserves a home
that's ready for him.

308
00:17:05.023 --> 00:17:08.201
Ready in ways
that I'm just not.

309
00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:14.598
Listen. that is the most
loving thing

310
00:17:14.729 --> 00:17:15.991
that you can ever do.

311
00:17:17.426 --> 00:17:19.429
It's what Gavin
would have wanted.

312
00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:20.996
Gavin?

313
00:17:21.127 --> 00:17:22.954
That was his father's name.

314
00:17:23.041 --> 00:17:23.999
Oh.

315
00:17:26.784 --> 00:17:29.352
Oh my goodness.

316
00:17:29.483 --> 00:17:32.355
He is absolutely beautiful.

317
00:17:33.617 --> 00:17:35.924
Oh. he's perfect.

318
00:17:36.055 --> 00:17:37.621
Look at him.

319
00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:40.972
Yeah. he is.

320
00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.105
It's gonna be okay.

321
00:17:52.506 --> 00:17:53.420
Can you give me one moment.
please?

322
00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:54.421
Hm. yeah.

323
00:18:00.122 --> 00:18:02.298
Do you believe in signs?

324
00:18:02.429 --> 00:18:04.213
What kind of signs?

325
00:18:04.344 --> 00:18:07.042
You know. like little winks
from the universe.

326
00:18:07.129 --> 00:18:07.869
that let us know

327
00:18:07.999 --> 00:18:10.567
that some things
are intentional.

328
00:18:10.654 --> 00:18:13.179
Sometimes. Why?

329
00:18:13.266 --> 00:18:15.094
I believe we were supposed
to meet.

330
00:18:17.139 --> 00:18:18.271
Let's go home.

331
00:18:21.796 --> 00:18:24.451
Mm... yes.

332
00:18:28.368 --> 00:18:29.499
Are you out of your mind?

333
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:31.458
What?

334
00:18:31.588 --> 00:18:33.895
Beth. you can't just invite
a stranger

335
00:18:33.982 --> 00:18:35.201
to sleep at our house.

336
00:18:35.288 --> 00:18:37.072
just because you had
one bonding moment.

337
00:18:37.203 --> 00:18:39.161
She could be dangerous.

338
00:18:39.248 --> 00:18:41.729
I don't recall pitching a fit
when you brought Tucker home.

339
00:18:41.816 --> 00:18:43.513
because you guys had
one bonding moment.

340
00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:44.862
Ta--

341
00:18:44.949 --> 00:18:46.473
I brought home a stray dog.

342
00:18:46.603 --> 00:18:48.736
You brought home a stray person!

343
00:18:48.823 --> 00:18:50.390
What's the difference?

344
00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.086
Oh. I don't know.

345
00:18:51.217 --> 00:18:52.348
Opposable thumbs.

346
00:18:52.479 --> 00:18:54.872
the ability to grasp things
like knives.

347
00:18:55.003 --> 00:18:57.440
Seriously?

348
00:18:57.571 --> 00:18:59.529
Have you really not thought
about the millions of ways

349
00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:01.879
this could take a straight turn
towards aid line?

350
00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:03.664
Of course. I have.

351
00:19:03.751 --> 00:19:05.622
That's why you are spending
the night

352
00:19:05.753 --> 00:19:07.798
in Mila's room tonight.

353
00:19:07.885 --> 00:19:10.714
It's one night. We'll survive.

354
00:19:10.845 --> 00:19:12.542
Or be brutally murdered.

355
00:19:12.673 --> 00:19:16.590
Well.
that is the other possibility.

356
00:19:16.677 --> 00:19:18.766
I'm so glad
we're taking this seriously.

357
00:19:18.853 --> 00:19:20.202
I love you. too.

358
00:19:20.333 --> 00:19:21.247
This is cute though.

359
00:19:28.993 --> 00:19:30.256
I love her.

360
00:19:30.343 --> 00:19:31.257
I love her.

361
00:20:06.248 --> 00:20:07.902
Oh my God.

362
00:20:08.032 --> 00:20:09.773
I'm sorry.
I should have knocked.

363
00:20:09.904 --> 00:20:12.820
You're fine. It's-- I'm just
a little jumpy.

364
00:20:12.907 --> 00:20:14.082
Well. I um...

365
00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:15.475
I brought you
some pyjama options.

366
00:20:15.605 --> 00:20:16.258
Thanks.

367
00:20:16.389 --> 00:20:17.216
Here.

368
00:20:19.218 --> 00:20:20.219
Um...

369
00:20:20.349 --> 00:20:21.872
Are you sure this is okay?

370
00:20:22.003 --> 00:20:23.918
I feel awful
taking your son's room?

371
00:20:24.048 --> 00:20:25.528
I could sleep on the couch
if you want.

372
00:20:25.659 --> 00:20:26.486
Ah.It's really no problem.

373
00:20:26.573 --> 00:20:27.878
We don't have a son.

374
00:20:28.009 --> 00:20:29.315
It's um...

375
00:20:29.402 --> 00:20:31.055
It's a long story.
but it's fine.

376
00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.452
We are right down the hall
if you need anything.

377
00:20:36.539 --> 00:20:37.758
- Okay.
- Okay.

378
00:20:37.888 --> 00:20:38.715
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

379
00:20:38.802 --> 00:20:41.240
Um. thank you for everything.

380
00:20:41.327 --> 00:20:42.328
You're welcome.

381
00:20:58.169 --> 00:20:59.040
Hmm.

382
00:21:34.162 --> 00:21:34.989
Mila!

383
00:21:38.993 --> 00:21:39.994
Mila!

384
00:21:40.124 --> 00:21:41.691
Mila. Mila!

385
00:21:41.822 --> 00:21:42.649
Mila!

386
00:21:43.954 --> 00:21:44.999
Mila. Mila!

387
00:21:45.129 --> 00:21:46.130
Oh...

388
00:21:47.828 --> 00:21:50.961
Oh.

389
00:21:51.048 --> 00:21:52.833
-Where is she?
-Okay. listen. I don't know.

390
00:21:54.313 --> 00:21:56.619
Oh. you know what
I'm talking about?

391
00:21:56.706 --> 00:21:57.794
I don't know.

392
00:21:59.143 --> 00:22:00.536
Where is she?

393
00:22:24.821 --> 00:22:26.910
You have really pretty hair.

394
00:22:27.041 --> 00:22:28.695
Thanks.

395
00:22:28.782 --> 00:22:30.261
You have pretty hair. too.

396
00:22:30.392 --> 00:22:33.352
I'm thinking of dyeing it
turquoise.

397
00:22:33.482 --> 00:22:35.354
And who said that
that was okay?

398
00:22:35.484 --> 00:22:37.704
Stella's mom says
it's a sign of courage

399
00:22:37.791 --> 00:22:40.010
and creativity.

400
00:22:40.097 --> 00:22:43.274
And does Stella's mom
also decide

401
00:22:43.362 --> 00:22:44.885
how much screen time
you get a day?

402
00:22:44.972 --> 00:22:46.408
Just because you're content

403
00:22:46.495 --> 00:22:48.889
being a grey sprinkle
on a rainbow cupcake.

404
00:22:48.976 --> 00:22:50.934
-doesn't mean I have to be.
-Alright.

405
00:22:51.021 --> 00:22:52.545
Well. this grey sprinkle

406
00:22:52.675 --> 00:22:53.763
has a lot more to talk
about in the car.

407
00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:55.243
So. let's go.

408
00:22:59.508 --> 00:23:01.728
Excuse me. ma'am.
where's my kiss?

409
00:23:04.121 --> 00:23:05.296
Come on. come on.

410
00:23:05.427 --> 00:23:07.821
Mmm. muah.

411
00:23:07.908 --> 00:23:09.518
We are gonna talk
about this later.

412
00:23:09.605 --> 00:23:11.302
- I love you.
- Love you.

413
00:23:12.869 --> 00:23:14.393
Well. this is gonna be
a fun car ride.

414
00:23:14.523 --> 00:23:16.525
Glad it's you and not me.

415
00:23:16.612 --> 00:23:17.700
Love you.

416
00:23:17.787 --> 00:23:19.093
Love you. my grey sprinkle.

417
00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:20.921
Mmm. thank you for that.

418
00:23:21.008 --> 00:23:25.186
Oh. I packed you a pasta salad.
bottom shelf.

419
00:23:25.273 --> 00:23:26.230
Babe. you're the best.

420
00:23:26.317 --> 00:23:27.406
Thank you.

421
00:23:28.972 --> 00:23:30.974
Oh my goodness.

422
00:23:31.105 --> 00:23:32.585
Hell hath no fury

423
00:23:32.715 --> 00:23:34.804
like a slightly inconvenienced
Gen Z-er.

424
00:23:36.763 --> 00:23:39.809
- She's adorable.
- Mm. thank you.

425
00:23:39.896 --> 00:23:41.637
You both seem like
really good parents.

426
00:23:41.768 --> 00:23:43.900
Yeah. it's mostly Terrence.
you know.

427
00:23:44.031 --> 00:23:46.250
He is the oldest
of four brothers

428
00:23:46.381 --> 00:23:47.948
and he has had some practice.

429
00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:57.784
You know what?

430
00:23:57.871 --> 00:23:59.960
Come on.
we're gonna go shopping.

431
00:24:00.047 --> 00:24:02.963
-Let's go.
-For what?

432
00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:05.313
You know. just the necessities.

433
00:24:05.444 --> 00:24:07.315
You didn't uh.
happen to grab a suitcase

434
00:24:07.402 --> 00:24:08.185
when you were running down
the street from your ex.

435
00:24:08.272 --> 00:24:08.925
did you?

436
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:12.581
No.

437
00:24:12.668 --> 00:24:13.669
I didn't think so.

438
00:24:13.756 --> 00:24:15.454
So. come on. My treat.

439
00:24:22.765 --> 00:24:24.550
You know. you don't have
to be this nice to me. right?

440
00:24:24.637 --> 00:24:28.249
Oh. my toxic trait
is being this nice to everyone.

441
00:24:28.379 --> 00:24:29.772
So. what you're saying is.
don't feel special.

442
00:24:29.859 --> 00:24:31.513
Oh. pretty much.

443
00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.036
Alright. got everything.

444
00:24:34.951 --> 00:24:36.475
Morning.

445
00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:39.260
Oh.

446
00:24:39.347 --> 00:24:41.305
Sorry. didn't mean to scare you.

447
00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:46.354
How can I help you?

448
00:24:46.441 --> 00:24:48.487
Well. I'm actually looking
for a missing person.

449
00:24:50.619 --> 00:24:53.187
She was uh. last seen
walking down the street.

450
00:24:54.884 --> 00:24:56.016
Oh. um...

451
00:24:56.146 --> 00:24:57.670
Didn't I see you last night?

452
00:24:57.757 --> 00:24:59.106
Um...

453
00:24:59.193 --> 00:25:01.804
We uh. we passed each other
on the street.

454
00:25:01.935 --> 00:25:04.546
-Did we?
-Yeah. we did.

455
00:25:04.633 --> 00:25:06.113
Well. I'm-- I'm sorry.

456
00:25:06.243 --> 00:25:08.115
I-- I haven't seen her.

457
00:25:08.202 --> 00:25:10.291
Have you contacted the police?

458
00:25:10.378 --> 00:25:11.901
Not yet.

459
00:25:12.032 --> 00:25:13.512
Well. maybe that should be
your next step.

460
00:25:14.861 --> 00:25:16.384
-Thanks for the tip.
-Mm-hmm.

461
00:25:24.218 --> 00:25:25.262
I got your keys.

462
00:25:25.393 --> 00:25:26.786
Oh. right.

463
00:25:26.916 --> 00:25:28.048
Um. thank you.

464
00:25:36.447 --> 00:25:37.884
This is bad.

465
00:25:37.971 --> 00:25:40.364
No. no. no. no. It's fine.
It's fine.

466
00:25:40.495 --> 00:25:42.062
He doesn't know you're here.

467
00:25:42.192 --> 00:25:43.063
Not yet.

468
00:25:45.544 --> 00:25:46.545
Alright. come on.
let's go this way.

469
00:25:49.156 --> 00:25:52.333
Ah. this is way too much.

470
00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:55.336
This is barely a fresh start.

471
00:25:55.466 --> 00:25:56.555
- Okay. we'll check your iron.
- Okay.

472
00:25:56.642 --> 00:25:58.295
And then we'll see
if we need anything else.

473
00:25:58.382 --> 00:26:01.081
Oh wait.
I think I know that woman.

474
00:26:01.168 --> 00:26:02.386
Yeah. I've seen her on some
of the mommy blogs.

475
00:26:02.473 --> 00:26:04.432
She's supposed to be this like.

476
00:26:04.519 --> 00:26:07.914
super midwife baby guru
that everyone swears by.

477
00:26:08.044 --> 00:26:10.351
She probably charges an arm
and a leg.

478
00:26:10.481 --> 00:26:12.440
Is everything okay?

479
00:26:12.527 --> 00:26:13.310
Yeah. it's fine.

480
00:26:13.441 --> 00:26:15.008
I just um.

481
00:26:15.138 --> 00:26:17.358
I just need to stop
by the office real quick.

482
00:26:17.445 --> 00:26:19.316
-Okay.
-Okay. Yeah. come on.

483
00:26:20.883 --> 00:26:22.145
I told you that you

484
00:26:22.276 --> 00:26:24.147
weren't going to be able
to avoid me forever.

485
00:26:24.234 --> 00:26:26.106
Now. what exactly are you
trying to do?

486
00:26:26.193 --> 00:26:28.630
Your dad and I
had agreements in place.

487
00:26:28.717 --> 00:26:31.372
when he started this business
and if it wasn't for me.

488
00:26:31.502 --> 00:26:32.982
you probably wouldn't
even have a business.

489
00:26:33.069 --> 00:26:34.418
as it is.

490
00:26:34.505 --> 00:26:35.506
-So-- Please
-Just-- just give me a moment.

491
00:26:35.594 --> 00:26:37.596
Just give me a moment. please?

492
00:26:46.256 --> 00:26:48.171
Hey.

493
00:26:48.258 --> 00:26:49.869
-Is everything okay?
-I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

494
00:26:49.956 --> 00:26:51.348
-I just um...
-You're having a panic attack.

495
00:26:51.479 --> 00:26:52.915
Or two.

496
00:26:53.002 --> 00:26:54.395
-Oh....
-It's okay. it's okay.

497
00:26:54.482 --> 00:26:55.526
Just breathe.

498
00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:58.355
Breathe.

499
00:26:58.442 --> 00:26:59.879
I used to have them
all the time.

500
00:26:59.966 --> 00:27:01.750
Really?

501
00:27:01.881 --> 00:27:03.796
You didn't think you were
the only person burdened

502
00:27:03.883 --> 00:27:05.711
with the crushing psychological
weight of being alive.

503
00:27:05.798 --> 00:27:06.712
Did you?

504
00:27:06.842 --> 00:27:08.409
Oh my goodness.

505
00:27:08.496 --> 00:27:10.585
Who is the jerk
with the receding hairline?

506
00:27:10.672 --> 00:27:12.848
Oh. he is a very unhappy client
that I wish

507
00:27:12.935 --> 00:27:13.936
that I could just tell to go
to hell.

508
00:27:14.067 --> 00:27:14.894
So. why don't you?

509
00:27:16.635 --> 00:27:18.071
You know. I know we just met
and it's really sweet

510
00:27:18.158 --> 00:27:19.681
that you think I'm the type
of person that can do that.

511
00:27:19.812 --> 00:27:21.509
but I'm really more
of the rollover

512
00:27:21.596 --> 00:27:22.815
and give you anything
you want type.

513
00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:26.122
What's his name?

514
00:27:26.209 --> 00:27:27.950
Kyle Morgan.

515
00:27:28.081 --> 00:27:29.169
Does he have any kids?

516
00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:32.651
Yeah. like three girls.

517
00:27:34.087 --> 00:27:36.393
Perfect. Follow me.

518
00:27:36.524 --> 00:27:37.525
What are you gonna--
What are you doing?

519
00:27:40.702 --> 00:27:42.835
Mr. Morgan! Hi.

520
00:27:42.922 --> 00:27:44.271
Quick question.

521
00:27:44.358 --> 00:27:46.012
Do you enjoy threatening
and gaslighting everyone

522
00:27:46.142 --> 00:27:47.622
with textbook verbal abuse.

523
00:27:47.753 --> 00:27:49.842
or is that a technique
you save specifically for women?

524
00:27:49.929 --> 00:27:51.104
What the hell are you
talking about?

525
00:27:51.191 --> 00:27:52.627
Oh. I'm sorry.

526
00:27:52.714 --> 00:27:54.542
Should I speak slower
or do you want to call

527
00:27:54.629 --> 00:27:56.544
one of your daughters
and have them explain it to you?

528
00:27:56.631 --> 00:27:57.458
Who the hell is this?

529
00:27:58.981 --> 00:28:00.896
Patricia Allen.
Mrs. Horby's attorney.

530
00:28:00.983 --> 00:28:02.158
You're a lawyer?

531
00:28:02.289 --> 00:28:03.638
Oh. I'm just here as a witness.

532
00:28:03.725 --> 00:28:06.075
Witness. for what?

533
00:28:06.162 --> 00:28:07.207
Would you like to take it
from here?

534
00:28:14.344 --> 00:28:16.433
From this point forward.

535
00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.654
all contracts
with Halo Interiors

536
00:28:19.785 --> 00:28:22.962
and Morgan Estates
are officially terminated.

537
00:28:23.049 --> 00:28:26.487
Your business is no longer
welcomed here.

538
00:28:26.574 --> 00:28:28.619
Neither is your nauseating
drugstore cologne.

539
00:28:33.668 --> 00:28:35.235
Your father would be ashamed.

540
00:28:39.892 --> 00:28:41.981
The only thing he would be
ashamed of

541
00:28:42.111 --> 00:28:43.896
is me letting you walk over me
for this long.

542
00:28:49.858 --> 00:28:51.817
Yes. girl.

543
00:28:51.904 --> 00:28:53.862
I can't believe I just did that.

544
00:28:53.949 --> 00:28:56.386
I have been dreaming
of doing that

545
00:28:56.517 --> 00:28:57.823
for the past seven months.

546
00:28:57.953 --> 00:28:59.128
Well. congrats.

547
00:28:59.259 --> 00:29:00.869
You are officially no longer
a pushover.

548
00:29:03.524 --> 00:29:04.438
Hey. Georgia.

549
00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:11.967
This may sound really crazy.
but do you want a job here?

550
00:29:12.054 --> 00:29:13.795
As what? Your lawyer?

551
00:29:13.882 --> 00:29:16.232
I think I might be
a few degrees short.

552
00:29:16.319 --> 00:29:18.365
No. no. no. no.
As-- as my assistant.

553
00:29:18.452 --> 00:29:19.627
It would just be temporary.

554
00:29:19.758 --> 00:29:21.542
I know you're going
to Florida.

555
00:29:21.672 --> 00:29:24.197
but maybe you could stay
an extra month. or two.

556
00:29:24.284 --> 00:29:26.765
Just until I find somebody else.

557
00:29:26.852 --> 00:29:28.201
I mean you'd collect
a couple of paychecks

558
00:29:28.331 --> 00:29:30.594
in the process.

559
00:29:30.681 --> 00:29:33.032
Wow. um...

560
00:29:33.119 --> 00:29:34.468
Okay. listen. don't--

561
00:29:34.555 --> 00:29:36.775
You don't have to feel
obligated to just say--

562
00:29:36.862 --> 00:29:38.733
-Yes.
-Really?

563
00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:40.735
Yeah. a 100%.

564
00:29:40.822 --> 00:29:43.390
Okay. Well. great.

565
00:29:43.477 --> 00:29:44.913
Do you wanna step
into my office.

566
00:29:45.044 --> 00:29:46.132
and we can discuss the details?

567
00:29:52.486 --> 00:29:55.445
Okay. but you offered her a job?

568
00:29:56.925 --> 00:29:59.449
You should have seen her.
She was amazing.

569
00:30:00.668 --> 00:30:02.104
Okay.

570
00:30:02.191 --> 00:30:04.803
Well. wasn't he one
of your biggest clients?

571
00:30:04.933 --> 00:30:07.457
Uh yes. and biggest headaches.

572
00:30:09.503 --> 00:30:11.157
Hey. are you at home?

573
00:30:13.724 --> 00:30:14.900
Uh. no. No. no.

574
00:30:14.987 --> 00:30:17.772
I just got back into the office.

575
00:30:17.859 --> 00:30:20.209
Anyway. I should probably
get back to it.

576
00:30:20.296 --> 00:30:21.645
Big day.

577
00:30:21.732 --> 00:30:23.517
Oh. okay.
Well. love you.

578
00:30:25.127 --> 00:30:25.998
Love you. too.

579
00:30:32.482 --> 00:30:33.179
Okay. here we go.

580
00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:38.880
And this. this is where we

581
00:30:38.967 --> 00:30:42.014
that no longer fit in the home's
new design aesthetic.

582
00:30:42.144 --> 00:30:45.800
I know. I know. but I promise
you. this is organized chaos.

583
00:30:45.887 --> 00:30:48.324
It's boxes full
of snow globe collections

584
00:30:48.455 --> 00:30:50.892
and mugs from around the world.

585
00:30:50.979 --> 00:30:53.590
Anything that would kind
of scare off potential buyers.

586
00:30:53.677 --> 00:30:56.028
Ah. like this little gem
right here.

587
00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:02.077
"World's greatest mom."

588
00:31:02.164 --> 00:31:04.210
Yeah. you'd have to be allow
that thing in your house.

589
00:31:05.907 --> 00:31:07.691
Oh. hi. Tony. Bradley.

590
00:31:07.822 --> 00:31:09.780
Please be careful with that.

591
00:31:09.911 --> 00:31:11.217
It is worth a fortune.

592
00:31:13.784 --> 00:31:15.438
-Hey.
-Hey.

593
00:31:15.569 --> 00:31:17.005
Oh.
and who's this glowing goddess?

594
00:31:17.092 --> 00:31:18.485
Desi. this is Georgia.

595
00:31:18.572 --> 00:31:21.270
Georgia. this is Desi.
one of our lead stagers.

596
00:31:21.401 --> 00:31:24.012
Um. she's a pretty good
with the clients.

597
00:31:24.099 --> 00:31:25.535
I.e. I scare them.

598
00:31:25.622 --> 00:31:26.797
Pretty much.

599
00:31:28.364 --> 00:31:29.670
Georgia is my new assistant.

600
00:31:29.757 --> 00:31:32.107
Ah. And just when I was
beginning to think.

601
00:31:32.238 --> 00:31:34.849
I would never hear
those three words.

602
00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:38.070
And Georgia is staying
with us for a little bit.

603
00:31:38.157 --> 00:31:41.203
Oh. well. that's intriguing.

604
00:31:41.334 --> 00:31:42.639
But also a mini crisis.

605
00:31:42.726 --> 00:31:44.337
We have another
hostage situation.

606
00:31:44.467 --> 00:31:45.904
Wh-- what's going on?

607
00:31:45.991 --> 00:31:47.688
The upholsterer
for the Hodge Project.

608
00:31:47.775 --> 00:31:49.472
apparently he's having
some financial problems.

609
00:31:49.603 --> 00:31:50.734
and they're behind
paying their team.

610
00:31:50.821 --> 00:31:52.214
So. the staff had a mutiny.

611
00:31:52.301 --> 00:31:54.390
and now they're holding
our items hostage.

612
00:31:54.477 --> 00:31:55.826
So. when is the install?

613
00:31:55.957 --> 00:31:57.393
Tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

614
00:31:57.524 --> 00:31:58.960
As in less than 24 hours.

615
00:31:59.047 --> 00:32:00.875
hence the slight panic
in my tone.

616
00:32:00.962 --> 00:32:02.703
And we do have other projects
with him. correct?

617
00:32:02.833 --> 00:32:04.226
- Regrettably.
- Great.

618
00:32:04.357 --> 00:32:06.533
Okay. well. just
pay the scumbag.

619
00:32:06.663 --> 00:32:08.970
give him an advance.
so that he can pay his workers.

620
00:32:09.057 --> 00:32:11.016
However. make sure they have
the furniture there

621
00:32:11.146 --> 00:32:13.932
before 9:30 a.m.

622
00:32:14.019 --> 00:32:15.629
Crisis averted.
Oh. please.

623
00:32:15.716 --> 00:32:17.283
make sure to tip them well.

624
00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:18.893
so that when they leave
and start their own business.

625
00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:20.939
we will get a first new
customer discount.

626
00:32:21.026 --> 00:32:23.028
Money's in the safe.
you know the code.

627
00:32:23.115 --> 00:32:25.552
Did you have anything to do
with this newfound confidence?

628
00:32:25.639 --> 00:32:27.032
Maybe a little bit.

629
00:32:27.162 --> 00:32:28.294
Well. it's sexy as hell.

630
00:32:28.424 --> 00:32:30.383
-Thank you.
-But I gotta go.

631
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:31.297
Stay rich and fabulous.

632
00:32:31.384 --> 00:32:32.515
Yes. ma'am.

633
00:32:32.602 --> 00:32:33.821
-It was nice to meet you.
-So nice.

634
00:32:36.041 --> 00:32:37.564
-She seems fun.
-She is.

635
00:32:37.651 --> 00:32:38.739
-Just don't sleep with her.
-Ha.

636
00:32:38.869 --> 00:32:40.697
Noted.

637
00:32:40.784 --> 00:32:43.962
Come this way.

638
00:32:50.707 --> 00:32:52.100
Hey.

639
00:32:52.231 --> 00:32:53.710
- Hey.
- So uh.

640
00:32:53.841 --> 00:32:56.409
when did you find time
to fold the laundry?

641
00:32:56.539 --> 00:32:59.455
Oh yeah. I got home like.
half an hour early.

642
00:32:59.542 --> 00:33:00.848
Hm.

643
00:33:00.935 --> 00:33:02.110
So. does this mean
I'm doing the dishes?

644
00:33:02.197 --> 00:33:03.285
Already done.

645
00:33:03.416 --> 00:33:06.158
What? Okay. Superman.

646
00:33:06.288 --> 00:33:09.117
So. why don't you uh. bring some
of that productivity upstairs?

647
00:33:09.248 --> 00:33:10.466
-Oh yeah?
-Yeah.

648
00:33:11.728 --> 00:33:12.816
I'll be right up.

649
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:15.471
Mm-hmm.

650
00:33:29.094 --> 00:33:30.660
Do you mind if
I'm a little late today?

651
00:33:30.791 --> 00:33:33.272
I'm meeting a couple for brunch
about a potential adoption.

652
00:33:33.359 --> 00:33:34.708
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

653
00:33:34.795 --> 00:33:36.188
They reached out last night.

654
00:33:36.275 --> 00:33:38.494
I don't know.
uh. we'll see how it goes.

655
00:33:38.581 --> 00:33:40.148
Um. I was just gonna get
an Uber to pick me up here.

656
00:33:40.235 --> 00:33:41.280
if that's cool.

657
00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:43.195
Of course.

658
00:33:43.325 --> 00:33:44.979
I mean. or I could drive you.

659
00:33:45.066 --> 00:33:46.154
I'll wait in the car.

660
00:33:46.285 --> 00:33:47.329
Get a little work done.

661
00:33:47.416 --> 00:33:49.592
I could use a change
of venue.

662
00:33:49.679 --> 00:33:52.204
Okay. yeah. thanks.

663
00:33:52.334 --> 00:33:53.509
-I'll grab my stuff.
-Okay.

664
00:34:03.563 --> 00:34:05.565
Thank you.

665
00:34:05.652 --> 00:34:06.783
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you so much.

666
00:34:06.914 --> 00:34:09.047
How nice to meet you.

667
00:34:09.134 --> 00:34:10.483
-I'll let you know tomorrow.
-Such a pleasure to meet you.

668
00:34:10.612 --> 00:34:11.571
-Bye.
-Bye.

669
00:34:18.752 --> 00:34:20.232
-Hi.
-Hey.

670
00:34:21.668 --> 00:34:24.192
So. how'd it go?

671
00:34:24.279 --> 00:34:25.846
So good.

672
00:34:25.933 --> 00:34:27.674
Yeah. better than good. great.

673
00:34:27.761 --> 00:34:30.197
They were so sweet and cute.

674
00:34:30.329 --> 00:34:32.418
And they've been trying
to get pregnant forever.

675
00:34:32.505 --> 00:34:34.463
And their last two adoptions
fell through at the last minute.

676
00:34:34.594 --> 00:34:36.987
So. they are desperate
and exhausted.

677
00:34:37.118 --> 00:34:39.033
And very. very generous.

678
00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:40.904
Yeah. how so?

679
00:34:41.034 --> 00:34:42.862
They offered to buy me a car.

680
00:34:42.949 --> 00:34:44.690
But can they do that?

681
00:34:44.777 --> 00:34:46.040
I guess.

682
00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:47.694
-I don't know.
-Hmm.

683
00:34:47.824 --> 00:34:49.478
And they offered to pay
for that fancy midwife

684
00:34:49.565 --> 00:34:52.132
we saw at the store.
and more than enough money

685
00:34:52.219 --> 00:34:54.657
for me to get set up
in Florida after the birth.

686
00:34:54.744 --> 00:34:56.268
So. what happens now?

687
00:34:57.486 --> 00:34:58.922
I don't know.

688
00:34:59.009 --> 00:35:00.446
I told them I'd let them know
tomorrow.

689
00:35:00.533 --> 00:35:02.665
but now that I'm hearing
all this out loud.

690
00:35:02.752 --> 00:35:04.754
that sounds insane. right?

691
00:35:04.841 --> 00:35:06.800
I think I should just say yes.

692
00:35:06.887 --> 00:35:08.062
I mean. what if they change
their mind?

693
00:35:08.149 --> 00:35:09.977
This could be the best offer
I get.

694
00:35:10.064 --> 00:35:11.283
Well. maybe you should just
sleep on it.

695
00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:15.678
I don't know.

696
00:35:15.765 --> 00:35:17.767
I feel like I should
just say yes.

697
00:35:17.854 --> 00:35:19.639
Listen to my gut.
and go for it. right?

698
00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:22.120
I'm just gonna call them
and say yes.

699
00:35:22.207 --> 00:35:23.208
Georgia. Georgia. Georgia.

700
00:35:23.295 --> 00:35:25.253
Yeah?

701
00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:28.648
What if you had another offer
on the table?

702
00:35:32.913 --> 00:35:35.916
It's not like we haven't thought
about adopting a thousand times.

703
00:35:36.046 --> 00:35:38.484
Yeah. through an agency

704
00:35:38.571 --> 00:35:41.269
with a reputation.
and-- and fancy plaques.

705
00:35:41.356 --> 00:35:44.794
Plenty of people
don't use an agency to adopt.

706
00:35:44.881 --> 00:35:46.927
It's more common than you think.

707
00:35:47.057 --> 00:35:49.408
Okay. and we will still use
an adoption attorney.

708
00:35:49.538 --> 00:35:51.366
Georgia already has one
picked out that she likes.

709
00:35:51.453 --> 00:35:53.890
Yeah. I bet she has.

710
00:35:54.021 --> 00:35:55.849
If you don't want me
to get poked

711
00:35:55.936 --> 00:35:59.809
and prodded anymore.
this is our chance.

712
00:35:59.896 --> 00:36:03.683
No injections. no trauma.
no drawn-out adoption process.

713
00:36:07.469 --> 00:36:08.514
Okay. how much does she want?

714
00:36:10.037 --> 00:36:11.734
$30.000.

715
00:36:13.519 --> 00:36:14.520
And I think we should
buy her a car.

716
00:36:15.956 --> 00:36:18.001
You're joking.

717
00:36:18.088 --> 00:36:20.047
She already has an offer
from another family.

718
00:36:21.788 --> 00:36:23.703
And let me guess.
she wants the money up front.

719
00:36:25.052 --> 00:36:26.358
Half. yes.

720
00:36:36.194 --> 00:36:37.064
Baby...

721
00:36:39.284 --> 00:36:42.896
there is a little boy out there
who needs a home...

722
00:36:44.332 --> 00:36:45.551
who needs a father.

723
00:36:47.248 --> 00:36:50.295
Someone to wrestle with.
and play football.

724
00:36:50.425 --> 00:36:51.687
Georgia can--

725
00:36:51.774 --> 00:36:53.733
can work with me
until she has the baby.

726
00:36:53.863 --> 00:36:55.996
And then she's off to Florida.

727
00:36:56.126 --> 00:36:59.086
And then we have
our family back.

728
00:36:59.173 --> 00:37:01.088
One girl. and one boy.

729
00:37:02.568 --> 00:37:03.917
Yeah.

730
00:37:04.004 --> 00:37:06.876
One very pricey receipt.

731
00:37:06.963 --> 00:37:08.922
What if God sent her here
for a reason?

732
00:37:11.098 --> 00:37:13.100
Ah. I hope you're right.

733
00:37:18.018 --> 00:37:19.759
Is that a yes?

734
00:37:24.459 --> 00:37:26.113
Whatever you want.

735
00:37:28.811 --> 00:37:30.335
Thank you.

736
00:37:30.465 --> 00:37:31.640
You're welcome.

737
00:37:31.727 --> 00:37:33.033
Don't forget this.

738
00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.165
Having a baby.

739
00:37:59.059 --> 00:38:00.626
I believe that midwifery

740
00:38:00.756 --> 00:38:01.888
is more
than simply a career.

741
00:38:01.975 --> 00:38:03.237
It's a calling.

742
00:38:03.368 --> 00:38:04.412
And it's my mission

743
00:38:04.499 --> 00:38:06.762
to not only guide
my pregnant patients

744
00:38:06.849 --> 00:38:10.462
through every stage of life.
but also assist them.

745
00:38:10.592 --> 00:38:13.682
I offer a wide range of
services from wellness coaching

746
00:38:13.813 --> 00:38:17.077
to prenatal care.
postpartum support.

747
00:38:17.164 --> 00:38:18.818
family planning.

748
00:38:18.905 --> 00:38:20.820
as well as a slew
of other elevated treatments

749
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:22.778
that you can pick
and choose from.

750
00:38:22.865 --> 00:38:24.824
Sounds expensive.

751
00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:29.176
Well. who's ready to hear
his heartbeat?

752
00:38:29.307 --> 00:38:30.395
I am.

753
00:38:30.525 --> 00:38:32.048
Okay.

754
00:38:40.796 --> 00:38:42.407
There he is.

755
00:38:42.494 --> 00:38:44.191
That's a good strong heartbeat.

756
00:38:47.368 --> 00:38:48.674
So. I want you to keep an eye

757
00:38:48.804 --> 00:38:50.545
on that elevated blood
pressure. okay?

758
00:38:50.676 --> 00:38:53.461
Try to stay as stress-free
and calm as possible.

759
00:38:53.548 --> 00:38:54.941
It's important for you
and for baby.

760
00:38:55.071 --> 00:38:57.465
-Yes.
-I'll try.

761
00:38:57.596 --> 00:39:00.642
Um. also I'd like to schedule
our prenatal exercise.

762
00:39:00.729 --> 00:39:02.905
How does tomorrow
at 3:30 sound?

763
00:39:02.992 --> 00:39:04.907
Works for me.
3:30 works great.

764
00:39:04.994 --> 00:39:05.821
-Okay. great.
-I'll see you then.

765
00:39:05.952 --> 00:39:07.040
Thank you so much.

766
00:39:07.127 --> 00:39:08.084
Oh. you're so welcome.

767
00:39:08.215 --> 00:39:09.521
-Bye.
-Bye.

768
00:39:11.827 --> 00:39:13.176
-She was great.
-She's lovely.

769
00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:16.658
-Can I?
-Yeah.

770
00:39:16.745 --> 00:39:17.877
Oh.

771
00:39:19.879 --> 00:39:21.184
- Let's see.
- Mm-hmm.

772
00:39:22.969 --> 00:39:24.057
Ah. you ready to go?

773
00:39:24.187 --> 00:39:26.320
Ready to go.

774
00:39:26.451 --> 00:39:29.497
I thought that we would start
with 10 to 15 minutes a day.

775
00:39:29.628 --> 00:39:32.326
Three days a week.
with one day off between walks.

776
00:39:32.457 --> 00:39:34.154
That way we can slowly
increase the intensity.

777
00:39:34.241 --> 00:39:35.590
and the duration.

778
00:39:35.677 --> 00:39:37.592
Is that safe for the baby?

779
00:39:37.723 --> 00:39:40.290
Oh. very. I like to think of
pregnancy as the one time.

780
00:39:40.421 --> 00:39:42.031
when you can ah. focus

781
00:39:42.118 --> 00:39:43.772
on not just setting records
with exercise. you know.

782
00:39:43.903 --> 00:39:45.470
-Okay.
-It's also about optimizing

783
00:39:45.557 --> 00:39:46.688
health for mama and baby.

784
00:39:46.819 --> 00:39:47.559
-Oh.
-Could you?

785
00:39:47.689 --> 00:39:48.734
-Absolutely.
-Thank you.

786
00:39:51.998 --> 00:39:54.479
Here we go. Gotta save the
energy for the actual workout.

787
00:39:54.609 --> 00:39:55.697
- Thank you.
- No. you're welcome.

788
00:39:59.658 --> 00:40:01.224
Is everything okay?

789
00:40:01.311 --> 00:40:03.401
I think I heard something.

790
00:40:03.531 --> 00:40:04.706
Here. I'll go see
what's going on.

791
00:40:04.793 --> 00:40:06.055
- You guys stay here.
- Sure.

792
00:40:25.292 --> 00:40:27.381
-Where is she?
-What are you doing in my house?

793
00:40:27.468 --> 00:40:28.904
I know she's here.

794
00:40:28.991 --> 00:40:30.950
You don't leave right now.
I'm calling the police.

795
00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:31.951
Puck!

796
00:40:34.736 --> 00:40:35.955
Run!

797
00:40:40.133 --> 00:40:41.351
-What's going on?
-Call 9-1-1.

798
00:40:41.439 --> 00:40:42.440
Quick.

799
00:40:45.138 --> 00:40:46.444
Get back here!

800
00:40:48.489 --> 00:40:49.708
You quit your pulling. huh?

801
00:40:49.795 --> 00:40:50.796
Get off of me!

802
00:40:50.926 --> 00:40:52.580
No!

803
00:41:11.512 --> 00:41:12.470
Georgia!

804
00:41:15.342 --> 00:41:17.126
I just wanted to talk to you.
okay!

805
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:36.319
Come on.
We're going down there.

806
00:41:36.406 --> 00:41:37.190
Downstairs.

807
00:42:20.581 --> 00:42:22.409
-The police are on their way.
-Ssh. ssh.

808
00:42:22.496 --> 00:42:23.410
Come with me. come on.

809
00:42:31.897 --> 00:42:32.898
Shit!

810
00:42:45.432 --> 00:42:46.346
Wait. wait.
Wait. wait. wait.

811
00:42:46.433 --> 00:42:47.521
Under the stairs.
Under the stairs.

812
00:42:47.608 --> 00:42:48.435
Okay.

813
00:42:51.612 --> 00:42:53.092
Sshhh.

814
00:43:01.056 --> 00:43:02.231
Sshhh.

815
00:43:56.459 --> 00:43:57.373
Okay. go.

816
00:44:41.766 --> 00:44:42.680
Come on. come on. come on.

817
00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:48.686
Okay. let's go.

818
00:44:52.777 --> 00:44:54.648
-Go. go. go. go!
-Okay. okay. okay. okay!

819
00:44:54.779 --> 00:44:56.345
Hey!

820
00:44:56.432 --> 00:44:57.433
Why are you acting like this?

821
00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:58.608
I just want to talk to you.

822
00:44:58.739 --> 00:44:59.958
-Leave me alone!
-Drive. drive. drive.

823
00:45:00.045 --> 00:45:01.002
Okay. okay.

824
00:45:24.939 --> 00:45:26.898
-Hey.
-Hey.

825
00:45:27.028 --> 00:45:27.855
How are you feeling?

826
00:45:27.942 --> 00:45:29.204
How's the baby?

827
00:45:29.291 --> 00:45:31.990
Oh. okay.

828
00:45:32.077 --> 00:45:34.035
Better knowing there's
an officer out front.

829
00:45:34.166 --> 00:45:35.602
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

830
00:45:35.689 --> 00:45:36.908
Carmen says everything's fine
after the fall. so...

831
00:45:38.866 --> 00:45:40.172
Can I talk to you
about something?

832
00:45:40.259 --> 00:45:42.087
Oh. of course.

833
00:45:42.174 --> 00:45:43.044
What about?

834
00:45:45.786 --> 00:45:49.094
You and your ex. I just--
I just don't understand

835
00:45:49.181 --> 00:45:53.141
how a woman who is so confident
and so self-assured.

836
00:45:53.272 --> 00:45:55.143
in every other aspect
of her life.

837
00:45:55.274 --> 00:45:57.755
would allow a man
to treat her like that.

838
00:45:57.842 --> 00:45:59.060
It just doesn't--

839
00:45:59.147 --> 00:46:00.061
Add up.

840
00:46:01.846 --> 00:46:04.196
Well. I wasn't gonna say
it exactly like that. but--

841
00:46:04.283 --> 00:46:06.676
You're right though. it doesn't.

842
00:46:06.764 --> 00:46:08.635
Why do you think I ran?

843
00:46:08.722 --> 00:46:10.419
When I'm not with him.

844
00:46:10.506 --> 00:46:14.467
I finally start to feel like
myself again.

845
00:46:16.251 --> 00:46:17.818
Or at least the version of me

846
00:46:17.949 --> 00:46:20.168
that I hope is still in there
somewhere.

847
00:46:20.255 --> 00:46:21.256
She is.

848
00:46:25.086 --> 00:46:26.784
There is something I wanted
to talk to you about. too.

849
00:46:28.481 --> 00:46:30.700
Please don't take this
the wrong way 'cause I'm--

850
00:46:30.788 --> 00:46:32.398
so grateful for everything

851
00:46:32.528 --> 00:46:34.617
you've done for me.

852
00:46:34.704 --> 00:46:36.489
but I am not sure
that I feel safe

853
00:46:36.619 --> 00:46:39.057
now that Puck knows I'm here.

854
00:46:39.144 --> 00:46:41.973
My heart's been racing non-stop.
and I'm afraid with my high BP.

855
00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:44.062
that staying just might not be
healthy for the baby.

856
00:46:44.192 --> 00:46:46.238
and I can't help

857
00:46:46.368 --> 00:46:47.630
but feel like it might be
better for everyone

858
00:46:47.717 --> 00:46:49.154
if I just disappeared again.

859
00:46:49.284 --> 00:46:50.546
No!

860
00:46:50.677 --> 00:46:51.591
Are you kidding?

861
00:46:51.721 --> 00:46:53.114
You are a godsend.

862
00:46:53.201 --> 00:46:56.248
We are so incredibly thankful.

863
00:46:56.335 --> 00:46:57.815
Please. let me figure this out.

864
00:46:57.945 --> 00:47:00.600
Let me find a solution. okay?

865
00:47:00.687 --> 00:47:03.298
I promise that I won't let
anything happen to you

866
00:47:03.385 --> 00:47:04.691
or the baby.

867
00:47:04.778 --> 00:47:06.736
-Really?
-Absolutely.

868
00:47:06.824 --> 00:47:07.825
Don't worry about anything.

869
00:47:10.436 --> 00:47:11.654
Thank you.

870
00:47:19.314 --> 00:47:21.926
You um. get some rest.

871
00:47:22.056 --> 00:47:23.188
Okay. Goodnight.

872
00:47:23.275 --> 00:47:24.189
Goodnight.

873
00:47:34.547 --> 00:47:36.157
Wow.

874
00:47:36.244 --> 00:47:38.333
It's a lot bigger
than the others.

875
00:47:38.464 --> 00:47:40.118
Well. two beds. two baths.

876
00:47:40.205 --> 00:47:41.989
Twice the square footage.

877
00:47:42.076 --> 00:47:44.339
And with us being
on the first floor.

878
00:47:44.426 --> 00:47:46.211
you have your own little oasis
in the back.

879
00:47:47.908 --> 00:47:50.606
Total transparency.
It's a tad over your budget.

880
00:47:50.693 --> 00:47:53.261
Well. there was plenty of space
in the studio apartment.

881
00:47:53.392 --> 00:47:54.219
don't you think?

882
00:47:56.177 --> 00:47:58.223
-Yeah. totally.
-Yeah.

883
00:47:58.310 --> 00:47:59.920
The view on the third floor
are definitely a bonus.

884
00:48:00.051 --> 00:48:01.052
Oh.

885
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:05.012
Are you okay?

886
00:48:05.143 --> 00:48:07.319
Here come. sit down.

887
00:48:07.406 --> 00:48:09.190
Oh. Yeah. I'm-- I'm okay.

888
00:48:09.277 --> 00:48:10.844
I was just...

889
00:48:10.975 --> 00:48:12.890
Oh. I think my blood pressure
might be a bit high.

890
00:48:16.371 --> 00:48:18.504
You don't um.
you don't think it's

891
00:48:18.591 --> 00:48:21.463
because of all the stairs
at the last unit. do you?

892
00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:22.638
There are quite a few.

893
00:48:24.597 --> 00:48:25.859
It's-- it's fine.

894
00:48:25.946 --> 00:48:26.904
I'll be fine.

895
00:48:29.558 --> 00:48:30.908
Oh. boy.

896
00:48:33.693 --> 00:48:35.564
Okay.

897
00:48:35.651 --> 00:48:39.264
So. if a client asks
for rusted Southwestern.

898
00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:42.789
Ooh. okay.

899
00:48:44.312 --> 00:48:47.925
I think I'd go
with Spanish textiles.

900
00:48:48.055 --> 00:48:49.796
- Okay.
- Iron work.

901
00:48:49.883 --> 00:48:51.058
-Yes.
-Terracotta

902
00:48:51.189 --> 00:48:53.017
with natural materials.

903
00:48:53.104 --> 00:48:56.368
And industrial touches.

904
00:48:56.498 --> 00:48:58.196
You're a natural.

905
00:48:58.283 --> 00:49:00.328
Can't remember the last time
I was this good at something.

906
00:49:00.459 --> 00:49:02.374
Oh now. all you need
is your own computer

907
00:49:02.504 --> 00:49:04.158
and your own car.

908
00:49:04.289 --> 00:49:06.073
What?

909
00:49:06.204 --> 00:49:08.162
Stop.

910
00:49:08.293 --> 00:49:10.512
-You didn't?
-Listen. it's nothing fancy.

911
00:49:10.643 --> 00:49:11.644
but it'll do.

912
00:49:11.731 --> 00:49:13.037
No. I can't accept this.

913
00:49:13.167 --> 00:49:15.865
Yes. you can.

914
00:49:15.953 --> 00:49:17.389
You are too good to me.

915
00:49:17.519 --> 00:49:21.088
No. honestly you could have
chosen any family.

916
00:49:21.219 --> 00:49:22.655
And probably a family
that could have done more

917
00:49:22.785 --> 00:49:23.961
than we can.

918
00:49:24.048 --> 00:49:26.572
So. we're grateful for you.

919
00:49:26.702 --> 00:49:27.965
Thank you so much.

920
00:49:30.619 --> 00:49:32.273
Mmm.

921
00:49:34.014 --> 00:49:37.539
Okay. now let's get
this apartment unpacked.

922
00:49:37.626 --> 00:49:38.671
Oh. phew.

923
00:49:38.758 --> 00:49:40.542
I know.

924
00:49:40.629 --> 00:49:41.848
Alrighty.

925
00:50:04.392 --> 00:50:06.264
So. hot delivery guy came by.

926
00:50:06.351 --> 00:50:08.614
Oh. I hope you tipped him well.

927
00:50:08.701 --> 00:50:10.398
Of course.

928
00:50:10.485 --> 00:50:12.618
You know you should really
write a book

929
00:50:12.705 --> 00:50:14.011
documenting your--

930
00:50:14.098 --> 00:50:15.360
Slut shenanigans?

931
00:50:15.447 --> 00:50:16.709
I was gonna say lovers.

932
00:50:16.839 --> 00:50:17.927
Ew. why?

933
00:50:18.058 --> 00:50:19.494
To avoid sounding crude.

934
00:50:19.581 --> 00:50:21.844
Honey.
if I avoided sounding crude.

935
00:50:21.975 --> 00:50:24.195
I'd be silencing one of my
biggest personality traits.

936
00:50:24.325 --> 00:50:25.326
Well. that's true.
That's true.

937
00:50:27.763 --> 00:50:30.157
Speaking of dominating
personalities...

938
00:50:30.244 --> 00:50:32.029
Uh-oh.

939
00:50:32.159 --> 00:50:33.595
I thought we were done
letting people walk all over us

940
00:50:33.682 --> 00:50:35.032
like cheap linoleum.

941
00:50:35.119 --> 00:50:36.424
What are you talking about?

942
00:50:36.511 --> 00:50:39.775
Rhymes with Porja.

943
00:50:39.862 --> 00:50:40.994
Yeah.
and that's what you're gonna be

944
00:50:41.125 --> 00:50:42.561
if you keep showering
your new bff with gifts.

945
00:50:42.648 --> 00:50:43.823
They're not gifts.

946
00:50:43.953 --> 00:50:45.564
They're necessities.

947
00:50:45.651 --> 00:50:47.261
And it's completely normal.

948
00:50:47.392 --> 00:50:50.177
Look. I like her
and everything.

949
00:50:50.308 --> 00:50:51.831
But I like you more.

950
00:50:51.918 --> 00:50:53.789
And I know that gorgeous
little heart of yours

951
00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:55.878
has no bounds.

952
00:50:55.965 --> 00:50:57.706
I just want to make sure
you're being safe about things.

953
00:50:57.793 --> 00:51:00.535
Well. I do appreciate
your concern.

954
00:51:00.622 --> 00:51:03.930
Just promise me you're not
gonna ignore any red flags?

955
00:51:04.017 --> 00:51:05.584
I promise. we're good.

956
00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:08.065
Just-- just trust me.

957
00:51:09.414 --> 00:51:11.416
Okay.

958
00:51:11.503 --> 00:51:13.635
Now. let's get back
to talking about me.

959
00:51:20.251 --> 00:51:21.730
Oh.

960
00:51:21.817 --> 00:51:23.254
How cute is this?

961
00:51:23.384 --> 00:51:26.170
-Oh my goodness.
-Oh. we have to get this.

962
00:51:26.257 --> 00:51:27.171
Absolutely.

963
00:51:38.443 --> 00:51:39.313
You're back.

964
00:51:39.444 --> 00:51:40.445
How's baby?

965
00:51:41.794 --> 00:51:43.665
Good. thanks.

966
00:51:43.752 --> 00:51:45.276
Wait a minute.
I thought you're having a girl?

967
00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:50.368
I'm-- I'm sorry. You must have
me confused with someone else.

968
00:51:50.498 --> 00:51:52.239
Oh no.
but we met a few months ago.

969
00:51:52.326 --> 00:51:53.893
You were in
with that really nice couple.

970
00:51:54.023 --> 00:51:55.895
No. never been here before.

971
00:51:58.202 --> 00:52:00.987
-I could have sworn--
-Uh. do you have this in sage?

972
00:52:01.074 --> 00:52:02.989
We're trying to stick
with a theme.

973
00:52:03.076 --> 00:52:05.513
I-- yeah.
I can check in the back.

974
00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:07.211
- Thanks.
- That's so cute.

975
00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:09.561
That was weird.

976
00:52:10.823 --> 00:52:12.041
What'd you find?

977
00:52:12.172 --> 00:52:13.478
Isn't this cute? Look.

978
00:52:13.565 --> 00:52:14.348
I don't know what it is though.

979
00:52:14.479 --> 00:52:15.480
Oh!

980
00:52:15.610 --> 00:52:17.046
-Oh God! I think I broke it.
-How cute!

981
00:52:17.134 --> 00:52:19.092
Oh. no. Oh my gosh.

982
00:53:06.183 --> 00:53:07.358
Oh. anybody having a meeting

983
00:53:07.445 --> 00:53:08.533
-with the Johnson's--
-Thanks.

984
00:53:08.663 --> 00:53:09.925
Definitely needs some caffeine.

985
00:53:10.012 --> 00:53:10.839
-I'll be there in 10.
-See you.

986
00:53:56.189 --> 00:53:57.321
Hey. girl.

987
00:53:57.408 --> 00:53:58.713
I knew I didn't like you.

988
00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:00.802
I just couldn't quite
put my finger on it.

989
00:54:00.933 --> 00:54:02.239
Until now.

990
00:54:02.369 --> 00:54:03.631
Yeah. I saw the security footage

991
00:54:03.762 --> 00:54:05.851
and I know you stole
from the Diaz's collection.

992
00:54:05.938 --> 00:54:07.331
What?

993
00:54:07.461 --> 00:54:09.071
I didn't steal anything!

994
00:54:09.202 --> 00:54:11.422
Oh. you mean the jewel thing?

995
00:54:11.509 --> 00:54:13.250
-Yeah.
-I took that to get polished.

996
00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:15.948
I thought it was scuffed.
but it was fine.

997
00:54:16.035 --> 00:54:17.689
I-- I thought it would be
a nice gesture.

998
00:54:17.776 --> 00:54:18.690
I can show you the receipt.

999
00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:20.518
Oh. fabulous. I'll wait.

1000
00:54:20.605 --> 00:54:21.693
Yeah. okay. one second.

1001
00:54:24.261 --> 00:54:25.131
Uh.

1002
00:54:28.090 --> 00:54:28.961
See?

1003
00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:34.532
Look. the next time you decide

1004
00:54:34.619 --> 00:54:36.229
to take something
from inventory.

1005
00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:39.101
kind gesture or not.
you run it by me.

1006
00:54:39.188 --> 00:54:40.407
-Capisce?
-Of course.

1007
00:54:40.538 --> 00:54:41.887
I'm sorry for the confusion.

1008
00:54:41.974 --> 00:54:42.801
Good.

1009
00:54:51.244 --> 00:54:51.984
What the hell was that about?

1010
00:54:53.986 --> 00:54:54.943
We might have a problem.

1011
00:55:47.692 --> 00:55:48.475
Was it good?

1012
00:56:32.432 --> 00:56:33.390
Hello?

1013
00:56:45.402 --> 00:56:46.403
Who are you?

1014
00:57:46.158 --> 00:57:47.986
Well. just checked on Mila.

1015
00:57:48.116 --> 00:57:48.900
She's sound asleep.

1016
00:57:50.684 --> 00:57:51.729
We need to talk.

1017
00:57:51.816 --> 00:57:53.818
Okay.

1018
00:57:53.905 --> 00:57:55.428
What-- what's up?

1019
00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:00.433
Hold on. it's Owen.

1020
00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:01.478
Hello.

1021
00:58:02.696 --> 00:58:03.480
What?

1022
00:58:05.612 --> 00:58:07.832
I'm on my way.
Okay. I'm coming.

1023
00:58:20.758 --> 00:58:22.368
Hey.

1024
00:58:22.455 --> 00:58:24.109
I came as soon as I heard.

1025
00:58:24.239 --> 00:58:25.371
How is she doing?

1026
00:58:25.458 --> 00:58:27.591
She's stable.

1027
00:58:27.721 --> 00:58:29.027
That's a good thing
Owen found her when he did.

1028
00:58:30.724 --> 00:58:31.725
What happened?

1029
00:58:31.812 --> 00:58:34.206
A stack of boxes
fell over on her.

1030
00:58:35.337 --> 00:58:36.469
How?

1031
00:58:36.556 --> 00:58:37.949
Your guess is as good as mine.

1032
00:58:40.908 --> 00:58:42.475
Has she talked?

1033
00:58:42.562 --> 00:58:43.607
Not yet.

1034
00:58:45.130 --> 00:58:47.393
The doctor said it may be
a couple of days.

1035
00:58:51.179 --> 00:58:53.138
Is there anything
I can get for you?

1036
00:58:53.225 --> 00:58:54.531
No. I'm good. I'm okay.

1037
00:58:55.923 --> 00:58:56.881
Hey.

1038
00:58:58.883 --> 00:58:59.971
She's gonna be fine.

1039
00:59:02.582 --> 00:59:04.497
I know. I know.

1040
00:59:05.933 --> 00:59:06.891
It's just um...

1041
00:59:08.414 --> 00:59:09.981
I think Terrence is having
an affair.

1042
00:59:10.068 --> 00:59:11.591
What?

1043
00:59:11.722 --> 00:59:13.898
Why?

1044
00:59:13.985 --> 00:59:17.858
Well. I saw him having coffee
today with another woman.

1045
00:59:21.645 --> 00:59:24.430
Okay. well coffee isn't
the most incriminating thing.

1046
00:59:24.561 --> 00:59:25.387
I mean. maybe there was
a good excuse.

1047
00:59:25.474 --> 00:59:26.824
He lied about it.

1048
00:59:29.087 --> 00:59:30.349
Damn.

1049
00:59:30.436 --> 00:59:31.437
Yeah.

1050
00:59:33.178 --> 00:59:34.614
I'm so sorry.

1051
00:59:34.701 --> 00:59:37.661
I-- I never would have taken him
for the cheater type.

1052
00:59:37.791 --> 00:59:39.532
Well. unfortunately.
it's not the first time.

1053
00:59:41.490 --> 00:59:43.841
When we found out
that I didn't have any um.

1054
00:59:43.928 --> 00:59:45.059
viable eggs.

1055
00:59:45.146 --> 00:59:47.714
we-- we had a really dark patch.

1056
00:59:50.761 --> 00:59:52.806
He swore it was
a one-time thing.

1057
00:59:52.937 --> 00:59:54.547
and I believed him.

1058
00:59:57.942 --> 00:59:59.030
That must have
been really tough.

1059
01:00:00.248 --> 01:00:01.032
It was.

1060
01:00:03.164 --> 01:00:04.122
How old was Mila?

1061
01:00:05.514 --> 01:00:06.603
It was before Mila was born.

1062
01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.911
But I thought you said
that it was--

1063
01:00:11.042 --> 01:00:13.261
Mila was born via donor egg.

1064
01:00:16.308 --> 01:00:20.312
Oh. I had no idea.

1065
01:00:21.835 --> 01:00:22.967
Most people don't.

1066
01:00:24.490 --> 01:00:26.623
With Mila being at the top
of that list.

1067
01:00:31.105 --> 01:00:33.630
You have no idea

1068
01:00:35.327 --> 01:00:40.724
what it feels to wake up
every day and feel broken.

1069
01:00:40.854 --> 01:00:44.162
because you are unable to do
what every other woman can.

1070
01:00:48.906 --> 01:00:50.516
It doesn't make her
any less yours.

1071
01:00:53.475 --> 01:00:54.346
Or him.

1072
01:00:56.130 --> 01:00:58.219
Well. I uh.

1073
01:00:58.350 --> 01:01:01.266
I guess the baby saved
our marriage once.

1074
01:01:01.353 --> 01:01:03.094
It can happen again. right?

1075
01:01:07.925 --> 01:01:08.969
Please wake up.

1076
01:01:10.492 --> 01:01:11.319
Please.

1077
01:01:13.365 --> 01:01:14.540
I need you right now.

1078
01:01:18.370 --> 01:01:19.545
Hi. babe. how's Desi?

1079
01:01:21.155 --> 01:01:22.635
Still out of it.

1080
01:01:22.722 --> 01:01:24.332
Oh jeez.

1081
01:01:24.419 --> 01:01:25.812
Hey. I was thinking that maybe

1082
01:01:25.943 --> 01:01:27.945
we'll swing by
the hospital tomorrow.

1083
01:01:28.075 --> 01:01:30.774
and we can drop off some
supper.
or maybe a couple of--

1084
01:01:30.861 --> 01:01:32.558
How long?

1085
01:01:35.866 --> 01:01:36.693
How long?

1086
01:01:49.009 --> 01:01:49.836
Right after Gavin.

1087
01:01:52.012 --> 01:01:54.754
I was in a bad head space.

1088
01:01:54.841 --> 01:01:56.408
A colleague of mine just
pressed the wrong button

1089
01:01:56.538 --> 01:01:58.802
and next thing I know
he's on the floor

1090
01:01:58.889 --> 01:02:00.673
and I'm out of the job.

1091
01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:02.414
You got fired?

1092
01:02:02.501 --> 01:02:04.851
Isn't that what
we're talking about?

1093
01:02:04.938 --> 01:02:07.419
I'm talking about the affair!

1094
01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:09.595
-What affair?
-I saw you.

1095
01:02:09.682 --> 01:02:11.205
You saw me what?

1096
01:02:11.292 --> 01:02:13.077
With her at Blackbird.

1097
01:02:16.254 --> 01:02:19.605
No. no. hun. that--
that was a job interview.

1098
01:02:19.692 --> 01:02:21.215
Terrence. don't lie to me.

1099
01:02:21.302 --> 01:02:23.043
I'm not lying to you.

1100
01:02:23.130 --> 01:02:25.393
I'll show you
the job application.

1101
01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:28.570
Beth. sweetheart. look at me.

1102
01:02:29.876 --> 01:02:32.052
I am not having an affair.

1103
01:02:34.576 --> 01:02:35.839
You promise?

1104
01:02:35.969 --> 01:02:39.973
On my life. okay.

1105
01:02:40.104 --> 01:02:42.802
I would never do that
to you again.

1106
01:02:42.933 --> 01:02:44.108
Are you kidding me?

1107
01:02:44.195 --> 01:02:46.458
That was the biggest mistake
of my life.

1108
01:02:48.547 --> 01:02:50.592
I mean. look. if you're--
you're unhappy.

1109
01:02:50.679 --> 01:02:52.116
When the baby comes. I know
it'll be just like last time.

1110
01:02:52.203 --> 01:02:53.508
What? No. Beth.

1111
01:02:53.595 --> 01:02:54.596
Time-out.

1112
01:02:58.339 --> 01:03:04.258
My love. having a baby did
not save our marriage. okay?

1113
01:03:04.345 --> 01:03:08.393
That was you and I.
we did that as a team.

1114
01:03:09.611 --> 01:03:10.917
Having Mila.

1115
01:03:11.048 --> 01:03:12.745
that was just the icing
on the cake.

1116
01:03:12.832 --> 01:03:16.096
that you and I built together.

1117
01:03:16.227 --> 01:03:17.968
Then why didn't you tell me?

1118
01:03:18.098 --> 01:03:21.101
After the whole Gavin fiasco.

1119
01:03:23.103 --> 01:03:24.801
I didn't want to add
to the stress.

1120
01:03:30.502 --> 01:03:31.851
Any prospects?

1121
01:03:31.982 --> 01:03:33.244
A couple.

1122
01:03:33.331 --> 01:03:37.335
But nothing really exciting.

1123
01:03:37.465 --> 01:03:39.293
Why don't you come work
for the company?

1124
01:03:39.424 --> 01:03:41.556
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1125
01:03:41.643 --> 01:03:43.820
I mean. you could handle
all the business stuff.

1126
01:03:43.907 --> 01:03:45.169
That would give me the time

1127
01:03:45.256 --> 01:03:46.518
to do the job
I'm actually good at.

1128
01:03:48.085 --> 01:03:49.564
Wouldn't we get tired
of each other?

1129
01:03:49.695 --> 01:03:50.783
Oh. absolutely.

1130
01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:57.268
But as you said. we're a team.

1131
01:03:57.355 --> 01:03:59.444
So what you're like.
my boss now?

1132
01:03:59.574 --> 01:04:00.967
Um. absolutely.

1133
01:04:01.054 --> 01:04:01.881
Is there a problem with that?

1134
01:04:02.012 --> 01:04:02.664
No. no. no.

1135
01:04:03.970 --> 01:04:04.841
Actually think it's kind of hot.

1136
01:04:04.928 --> 01:04:05.842
Mm-hmm.

1137
01:04:07.669 --> 01:04:09.584
But um.
you are still in trouble. sir.

1138
01:04:09.715 --> 01:04:11.935
You have to always tell me
the truth.

1139
01:04:12.065 --> 01:04:12.979
I promise.

1140
01:04:15.199 --> 01:04:16.287
I love you.

1141
01:04:16.374 --> 01:04:19.856
Hmm. love you. too.

1142
01:04:46.534 --> 01:04:48.536
I might be totally
history-revisioning

1143
01:04:48.623 --> 01:04:51.061
the hell out of this.
but I wanna say they talked

1144
01:04:51.191 --> 01:04:53.193
about meeting her at some kind
of online mom's group.

1145
01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:54.325
Did they say the name?

1146
01:04:54.412 --> 01:04:56.849
I don't really. I--

1147
01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:59.025
It was something weird.
It didn't really make sense.

1148
01:04:59.112 --> 01:05:00.984
Was it Mommy Mine?

1149
01:05:01.114 --> 01:05:02.159
That's it.

1150
01:05:05.031 --> 01:05:05.902
Are you okay?

1151
01:05:07.512 --> 01:05:09.209
Yes. thank you.
I just-- I just have to go.

1152
01:05:50.337 --> 01:05:51.295
What...

1153
01:06:07.876 --> 01:06:09.835
I was afraid if you knew I had
a previous miscarriage.

1154
01:06:09.922 --> 01:06:12.403
you'd panic. and I just--
I didn't want to scare you.

1155
01:06:12.490 --> 01:06:13.926
I'm so sorry.

1156
01:06:14.013 --> 01:06:15.275
I know I should have been
up front with you. but...

1157
01:06:16.842 --> 01:06:17.974
I can't believe they're dead.

1158
01:06:19.714 --> 01:06:20.802
You don't think Puck
had anything to do with this.

1159
01:06:20.889 --> 01:06:22.456
do you?

1160
01:06:22.543 --> 01:06:23.980
Well. the police say
they don't suspect foul play.

1161
01:06:25.242 --> 01:06:26.330
I hope they're not wrong.

1162
01:06:33.293 --> 01:06:34.164
How's your blood pressure?

1163
01:06:36.557 --> 01:06:37.994
Ask me again in an hour.

1164
01:06:50.310 --> 01:06:52.791
Hey. I got food.

1165
01:06:52.921 --> 01:06:54.880
Oh. finally I'm famished.

1166
01:07:02.366 --> 01:07:03.193
Hey. hey!

1167
01:07:06.152 --> 01:07:07.110
What the hell is this?

1168
01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:08.589
It's cool.

1169
01:07:08.676 --> 01:07:09.547
We're in the clear.

1170
01:07:10.809 --> 01:07:12.028
What-- what do you mean?

1171
01:07:15.074 --> 01:07:16.119
You didn't do this?
Puck. you don't need to worry
about this.

1172
01:07:16.249 --> 01:07:17.642
Did you do this?

1173
01:07:17.729 --> 01:07:19.035
No. I didn't kill them.

1174
01:07:21.211 --> 01:07:21.994
Lying.

1175
01:07:22.081 --> 01:07:23.169
I'm not lying!

1176
01:07:23.256 --> 01:07:24.736
Then who the hell did it then.
huh?

1177
01:07:26.738 --> 01:07:27.565
I did.

1178
01:07:29.697 --> 01:07:32.265
They knew too much.
it had to be done.

1179
01:07:32.352 --> 01:07:34.180
Why would you do that?

1180
01:07:34.267 --> 01:07:35.703
That wasn't even part
of the plan!

1181
01:07:35.790 --> 01:07:37.401
Relax.
They didn't feel a thing.

1182
01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:41.057
You're a sociopath.

1183
01:07:41.144 --> 01:07:42.754
Well. welcome to the club.
snowflake.

1184
01:07:44.930 --> 01:07:46.671
Oh. daddy's mad.

1185
01:07:46.758 --> 01:07:47.585
Hey.

1186
01:07:49.848 --> 01:07:51.632
Calm down. okay.

1187
01:07:51.719 --> 01:07:53.417
Hey. we have a new plan.

1188
01:07:53.504 --> 01:07:54.853
Look at me.

1189
01:07:54.940 --> 01:08:00.554
Hey. how does $600.000 sound?

1190
01:08:02.687 --> 01:08:04.471
What are you talking about?

1191
01:08:04.558 --> 01:08:06.430
Now he's listening.

1192
01:08:06.517 --> 01:08:08.736
In 48 hours.

1193
01:08:08.867 --> 01:08:12.175
Halo is going to unload a truck
with enough expensive art

1194
01:08:12.262 --> 01:08:14.916
to fill an oceanfront penthouse.

1195
01:08:15.003 --> 01:08:17.309
And when the sun goes down.
we're going to load it

1196
01:08:17.397 --> 01:08:20.139
all right back
into the same truck.

1197
01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:22.098
Along with everything else
inside.

1198
01:08:22.228 --> 01:08:23.577
And then we're out of here.

1199
01:08:23.664 --> 01:08:26.276
With a big-ass payday
in the back seat.

1200
01:08:28.626 --> 01:08:30.236
$600.000. huh?

1201
01:08:33.065 --> 01:08:34.458
Sounds nice. doesn't it?

1202
01:08:35.675 --> 01:08:36.808
There he is.

1203
01:08:43.162 --> 01:08:43.988
Nobody else dies.

1204
01:08:44.076 --> 01:08:45.032
Do you understand me?

1205
01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:45.991
Deal.

1206
01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:49.821
Say it.

1207
01:08:54.913 --> 01:08:57.655
Nobody else dies. hm.

1208
01:08:59.874 --> 01:09:01.137
Nobody else dies.

1209
01:09:24.769 --> 01:09:25.987
Let's this put this over there.

1210
01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:51.273
Oh.

1211
01:10:38.582 --> 01:10:39.757
Hello?

1212
01:10:40.975 --> 01:10:42.237
Is anyone home?

1213
01:10:43.456 --> 01:10:44.240
Georgia?

1214
01:10:49.723 --> 01:10:50.594
Hello?

1215
01:10:53.291 --> 01:10:54.337
Okay.

1216
01:11:21.973 --> 01:11:23.148
Oh my goodness.

1217
01:11:26.456 --> 01:11:28.284
...the articles might be...

1218
01:11:28.371 --> 01:11:29.981
Okay. okay. okay.

1219
01:11:30.068 --> 01:11:31.983
Okay. okay. I'm going here.

1220
01:11:32.112 --> 01:11:33.245
Oh.

1221
01:11:33.332 --> 01:11:34.725
There's a lot of stuff.

1222
01:11:34.855 --> 01:11:36.466
But if we each take a truck.
we'll triple our odds.

1223
01:11:49.827 --> 01:11:51.175
Hey. girl.

1224
01:11:52.351 --> 01:11:53.831
I know.

1225
01:11:53.918 --> 01:11:55.485
I know this is a shocking turn
of events for you.

1226
01:11:57.269 --> 01:11:58.314
And I hope you know
it brings me zero pleasure.

1227
01:12:00.228 --> 01:12:01.317
I actually like you a lot.

1228
01:12:02.927 --> 01:12:04.362
More than any of the others.
which is weird.

1229
01:12:04.450 --> 01:12:05.712
'cause I normally
don't like anyone.

1230
01:12:05.843 --> 01:12:06.931
It's true.

1231
01:12:07.018 --> 01:12:08.236
She's really
not a people person.

1232
01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:09.412
You remember Carmen. right?

1233
01:12:09.499 --> 01:12:10.413
Surprise.

1234
01:12:10.543 --> 01:12:12.023
Not a midwife.

1235
01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:13.416
Although. I do think.

1236
01:12:13.546 --> 01:12:14.330
I'm starting to get
a bit of a knack for it.

1237
01:12:16.114 --> 01:12:17.681
So. here's the thing. B.

1238
01:12:17.768 --> 01:12:21.554
We are in a bit of a pickle.

1239
01:12:21.641 --> 01:12:24.165
Really going off-script
with this one.

1240
01:12:24.296 --> 01:12:28.692
And it is going to require
a little bit of acting from you.

1241
01:12:30.346 --> 01:12:31.695
So. I hope you're up
for the challenge.

1242
01:12:34.001 --> 01:12:34.827
This time tomorrow.

1243
01:12:34.959 --> 01:12:36.787
we'll be halfway
across the state

1244
01:12:36.874 --> 01:12:40.268
with well.
everything inside this place.

1245
01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:42.009
Plus.
the McQueen's art collection

1246
01:12:42.096 --> 01:12:43.359
which won't be here
until the morning.

1247
01:12:43.489 --> 01:12:46.362
as you know.
that's our little dilemma.

1248
01:12:46.449 --> 01:12:48.668
So. until then. you'll be here.

1249
01:12:51.236 --> 01:12:52.411
First thing on the to-do list.

1250
01:12:52.498 --> 01:12:53.585
I'm going to need you
to call Terrence.

1251
01:12:53.673 --> 01:12:54.934
and let him know that.

1252
01:12:55.066 --> 01:12:55.762
you'll be sleeping
at the hospital tonight

1253
01:12:55.893 --> 01:12:56.937
with Desi.

1254
01:12:57.023 --> 01:12:58.460
Muah.

1255
01:12:58.591 --> 01:12:59.679
Poor Desi.

1256
01:13:01.507 --> 01:13:03.117
Think you can handle that?

1257
01:13:04.641 --> 01:13:06.294
Oh. right.

1258
01:13:06.382 --> 01:13:07.383
Silly me.

1259
01:13:09.297 --> 01:13:11.169
Let's try that again. shall we?

1260
01:13:11.299 --> 01:13:12.518
He won't believe me.

1261
01:13:14.868 --> 01:13:16.740
For your sake. I hope he does.

1262
01:13:18.263 --> 01:13:19.743
Or the next phone call
will be to Mila.

1263
01:13:19.873 --> 01:13:21.919
informing her
of mommy's little secret.

1264
01:13:26.010 --> 01:13:28.186
Though. I guess the mommy part
isn't completely accurate now.

1265
01:13:28.273 --> 01:13:29.100
is it?

1266
01:13:31.755 --> 01:13:32.755
Phone.

1267
01:13:36.847 --> 01:13:38.282
Thank you.

1268
01:13:54.473 --> 01:13:55.300
Hey. babe.

1269
01:13:55.431 --> 01:13:56.519
Hey.

1270
01:13:56.648 --> 01:13:58.651
What are you guys up to?

1271
01:13:58.782 --> 01:14:02.219
Uh. just helping Mila
with her homework.

1272
01:14:02.307 --> 01:14:06.572
Um. I'm going
to spend the night

1273
01:14:06.702 --> 01:14:08.487
at the hospital with Desi.

1274
01:14:08.574 --> 01:14:09.793
They think she may wake up

1275
01:14:09.923 --> 01:14:11.621
and I don't want her
to be alone.

1276
01:14:11.751 --> 01:14:13.187
Oh.

1277
01:14:13.318 --> 01:14:14.928
Do you want us to bring you
a bag or something?

1278
01:14:15.014 --> 01:14:15.538
No. no. no.

1279
01:14:15.625 --> 01:14:17.409
I um.

1280
01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:19.716
I grabbed some things
this morning before I left.

1281
01:14:19.803 --> 01:14:20.673
Okay.

1282
01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:21.848
Well. just keep me posted.

1283
01:14:21.934 --> 01:14:22.545
Love you.

1284
01:14:22.675 --> 01:14:24.023
Love you!

1285
01:14:24.155 --> 01:14:24.982
Love you. too.

1286
01:14:28.333 --> 01:14:30.770
Okay. well.
we've got some errands to run.

1287
01:14:30.857 --> 01:14:32.468
but Puck's gonna hang out
and make sure

1288
01:14:32.555 --> 01:14:34.644
everything stays copacetic.

1289
01:14:37.385 --> 01:14:38.822
Best behavior. okay?

1290
01:15:01.235 --> 01:15:02.019
Thank you.

1291
01:15:04.543 --> 01:15:05.370
Please. don't.

1292
01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:08.329
Just-- just for a few minutes.

1293
01:15:08.416 --> 01:15:10.505
I promise. I won't scream.

1294
01:15:10.593 --> 01:15:11.376
Whatever.

1295
01:15:20.254 --> 01:15:21.212
Am I gonna die?

1296
01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:25.389
No.

1297
01:15:26.782 --> 01:15:27.871
No. No one else is dying.

1298
01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:30.526
You're not so sure. are you?

1299
01:15:31.918 --> 01:15:33.529
They gave me their word.

1300
01:15:36.532 --> 01:15:38.969
Honesty isn't really
their strong suit though. is it?

1301
01:15:39.099 --> 01:15:41.841
Look. we-- we have a system
in place. okay?

1302
01:15:41.928 --> 01:15:44.278
And that-- the dying's
not a part of it.

1303
01:15:44.365 --> 01:15:46.150
Just like last time?

1304
01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:49.240
Yeah. well. last time didn't go
according to plan.

1305
01:15:49.370 --> 01:15:51.242
Is this going according to plan?

1306
01:15:54.462 --> 01:15:55.681
You're not a killer.

1307
01:15:57.378 --> 01:15:58.815
I can tell.

1308
01:15:58.902 --> 01:16:00.338
What part of

1309
01:16:00.425 --> 01:16:02.775
"No one is gonna die".
don't you understand. huh?

1310
01:16:02.862 --> 01:16:04.690
I want to believe you.

1311
01:16:04.777 --> 01:16:05.691
I do.

1312
01:16:07.214 --> 01:16:09.652
Listen. I have a little girl.

1313
01:16:09.782 --> 01:16:10.522
- I have a husband.
- Oh. don't do that.

1314
01:16:10.653 --> 01:16:11.958
-I have a--
-Stop doing that.

1315
01:16:12.045 --> 01:16:14.308
-Okay. please.
-Don't do what?

1316
01:16:14.439 --> 01:16:16.267
Trying to make yourself more
of a person.

1317
01:16:16.353 --> 01:16:18.748
Trying to connect to me.
like I'm some type of kidnapper.

1318
01:16:20.487 --> 01:16:23.013
This isn't what's going on here.
okay?

1319
01:16:23.143 --> 01:16:24.101
I'm not a killer.

1320
01:16:26.843 --> 01:16:28.366
God damn it!

1321
01:16:28.496 --> 01:16:29.759
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1322
01:16:29.846 --> 01:16:31.499
You know.

1323
01:16:31.587 --> 01:16:32.457
none of this would be happening
if you weren't so nice.

1324
01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:35.547
She knew if she laid
that victim crap on you.

1325
01:16:35.634 --> 01:16:37.593
you'd take her in.

1326
01:16:37.723 --> 01:16:38.724
Now what are you going to do?

1327
01:16:38.811 --> 01:16:40.291
You go-- you go
and give her a job.

1328
01:16:40.378 --> 01:16:42.423
You give her all these
crazy-ass ideas.

1329
01:16:42.510 --> 01:16:44.861
I mean.
no wonder this is happening.

1330
01:16:44.948 --> 01:16:46.340
You know. none of the others
were like this.

1331
01:16:46.471 --> 01:16:47.820
We were just--

1332
01:16:47.907 --> 01:16:49.779
We just target a woman.
pocket a few thousand.

1333
01:16:49.866 --> 01:16:51.693
take some nice shit. bounce.

1334
01:16:51.824 --> 01:16:52.608
Nobody gets hurt.

1335
01:16:54.087 --> 01:16:57.612
Just emotionally devastated.
right?

1336
01:16:59.309 --> 01:17:01.398
Now listen. it's not too late.

1337
01:17:01.486 --> 01:17:03.967
You can fix this.

1338
01:17:04.054 --> 01:17:06.447
Yeah. like my hands
are so clean. right?

1339
01:17:06.577 --> 01:17:08.275
Your hands might not be clean.

1340
01:17:08.362 --> 01:17:10.582
but at least they don't
have blood on 'em.

1341
01:17:10.669 --> 01:17:11.757
Not yet at least.

1342
01:17:13.672 --> 01:17:16.196
And you and I both know.

1343
01:17:16.327 --> 01:17:20.505
they're going to keep pushing.
and pushing.

1344
01:17:20.636 --> 01:17:25.162
And it is only a matter of time
before your hands are so dirty.

1345
01:17:26.598 --> 01:17:28.382
that they can't possibly
become clean.

1346
01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:48.664
Okay.

1347
01:17:50.491 --> 01:17:51.797
Ah!

1348
01:17:53.059 --> 01:17:55.148
Not another step.

1349
01:17:58.325 --> 01:17:59.152
Hey!

1350
01:18:00.675 --> 01:18:02.112
Let her go.

1351
01:18:02.199 --> 01:18:03.809
Or I'll call the cops myself.

1352
01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:06.290
Why do you have to go say
a silly thing like that?

1353
01:18:09.162 --> 01:18:10.860
No! No! No!

1354
01:18:13.689 --> 01:18:14.690
No. no. no!

1355
01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:21.218
Sorry. Georgia.

1356
01:18:25.178 --> 01:18:26.049
Get her!

1357
01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:28.094
Now!

1358
01:18:50.421 --> 01:18:52.291
What was that?

1359
01:18:52.423 --> 01:18:54.120
It was probably Owen.

1360
01:18:54.251 --> 01:18:56.340
-Who the hell is Owen?
-The security guard.

1361
01:18:56.427 --> 01:18:57.602
Fine. Take care of it.
I got her.

1362
01:18:57.733 --> 01:18:59.473
No.

1363
01:18:59.559 --> 01:19:00.431
She's mine.

1364
01:19:02.085 --> 01:19:02.912
Okay.

1365
01:19:04.827 --> 01:19:07.090
-Switch me then.
-Why?

1366
01:19:07.177 --> 01:19:08.308
Because Johnny Rent-A-Cops
probably got a gun.

1367
01:19:08.439 --> 01:19:09.440
and yours just a mom.

1368
01:19:14.358 --> 01:19:15.968
And try not to get any blood
on the furniture.

1369
01:19:16.099 --> 01:19:17.448
I want top dollar
for everything in here.

1370
01:19:18.797 --> 01:19:19.624
I mean it!

1371
01:19:30.243 --> 01:19:32.680
I thought it was great.

1372
01:19:32.768 --> 01:19:33.769
Oh. your mom's gonna be su--

1373
01:19:37.947 --> 01:19:38.773
Honey?

1374
01:19:40.036 --> 01:19:41.994
Where's mom?

1375
01:19:42.081 --> 01:19:42.778
I don't know.

1376
01:19:54.485 --> 01:19:55.791
Come on. let's go.

1377
01:20:06.671 --> 01:20:08.151
You know. I wasn't lying

1378
01:20:08.237 --> 01:20:10.414
when I said
I actually like you Bethany.

1379
01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:15.332
Turns out.
we're not so different.

1380
01:20:15.419 --> 01:20:16.507
you and I.

1381
01:20:18.857 --> 01:20:21.686
I was barely 18.
when they told me

1382
01:20:21.773 --> 01:20:23.644
that I'd never be able
to get pregnant.

1383
01:20:25.081 --> 01:20:26.517
First time. I pretended

1384
01:20:26.647 --> 01:20:28.780
it was at one of those
maternity shops

1385
01:20:28.911 --> 01:20:30.651
with the fake bumps
in the dressing rooms.

1386
01:20:30.737 --> 01:20:32.653
you know.

1387
01:20:32.784 --> 01:20:34.960
I just wanted to numb the shame.

1388
01:20:37.702 --> 01:20:39.573
Forget for a few minutes

1389
01:20:39.704 --> 01:20:41.967
that I couldn't do
what everyone else could.

1390
01:20:49.279 --> 01:20:53.849
How many moms are unhappy
with their one or two kids?

1391
01:20:55.459 --> 01:20:57.112
Always wanting more!

1392
01:20:58.766 --> 01:21:00.202
You think I'm greedy?

1393
01:21:01.943 --> 01:21:03.380
Look in the mirror!

1394
01:21:06.339 --> 01:21:09.734
Not all of us can afford
to buy a family

1395
01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:11.954
when things don't work out.
Bethany.

1396
01:21:13.912 --> 01:21:16.349
You have a perfectly healthy
little girl.

1397
01:21:18.830 --> 01:21:20.571
And it's still not enough
for you.

1398
01:21:21.877 --> 01:21:23.574
And the justifications!

1399
01:21:25.271 --> 01:21:28.666
The justifications are truly
works of delusion.

1400
01:21:30.102 --> 01:21:32.409
"It's for my husband.

1401
01:21:32.496 --> 01:21:33.889
He deserves a son.

1402
01:21:35.978 --> 01:21:37.980
She deserves a brother
to play with.

1403
01:21:38.110 --> 01:21:39.590
He deserves a sister."

1404
01:21:41.374 --> 01:21:42.680
Well. you know what I deserve?

1405
01:21:45.596 --> 01:21:47.337
A God damn break!

1406
01:21:49.382 --> 01:21:50.427
Aaa!

1407
01:21:53.952 --> 01:21:56.912
And that is where our little
rewrite comes in.

1408
01:21:59.610 --> 01:22:03.570
Maybe. I'll use the money
from selling everything

1409
01:22:03.701 --> 01:22:05.268
to start
my own staging business.

1410
01:22:07.096 --> 01:22:09.794
You can keep the boring husband.
and the cute kid.

1411
01:22:12.014 --> 01:22:13.276
This mommy wants the career.

1412
01:22:32.034 --> 01:22:33.731
Stay here. lock the door.

1413
01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:45.960
Dad!

1414
01:22:48.746 --> 01:22:51.443
Look at all
this beautiful furniture.

1415
01:22:51.531 --> 01:22:53.969
Your mom has very good taste.

1416
01:22:55.361 --> 01:22:56.884
I know you think

1417
01:22:57.014 --> 01:22:59.626
that I'm probably a bad person
and that's fair.

1418
01:22:59.757 --> 01:23:02.107
But I promise you. I'm not.

1419
01:23:02.193 --> 01:23:03.848
I'm a good person.

1420
01:23:03.978 --> 01:23:05.893
As long as you do
what I say. okay.

1421
01:23:06.023 --> 01:23:07.983
You do that.
and we'll get along fine. okay.

1422
01:23:10.333 --> 01:23:11.246
Well. nobody told me

1423
01:23:11.334 --> 01:23:12.857
it was take your kid
to work day.

1424
01:23:14.293 --> 01:23:15.642
-Mila.
-Mommy!

1425
01:23:15.773 --> 01:23:16.861
Oh. nice try.

1426
01:23:18.645 --> 01:23:20.473
What are you doing?

1427
01:23:20.603 --> 01:23:22.258
Upping the stakes. duh.

1428
01:23:34.487 --> 01:23:35.532
Puck. give me...

1429
01:23:43.844 --> 01:23:45.716
Oh. Puck.

1430
01:23:49.675 --> 01:23:50.590
Puck. baby.

1431
01:23:50.721 --> 01:23:52.157
I hope you're alright.

1432
01:24:02.559 --> 01:24:03.386
Okay. Bethany.

1433
01:24:04.865 --> 01:24:05.910
Here's how this is gonna go.

1434
01:24:07.433 --> 01:24:09.218
You're gonna give me the cash
in the safe

1435
01:24:09.348 --> 01:24:10.219
and we're gonna call it a day.

1436
01:24:11.829 --> 01:24:14.049
You'll never see
or hear from me again.

1437
01:24:19.576 --> 01:24:20.968
- Baby. come on. come on. yes.
- Mommy!

1438
01:24:21.099 --> 01:24:22.361
- Come here. baby. it's okay.
- Beth!

1439
01:24:22.448 --> 01:24:23.058
It's okay.
We're okay. we're okay.

1440
01:24:23.145 --> 01:24:25.103
Mila! Mila!

1441
01:24:25.190 --> 01:24:27.366
Baby. yes. we're in here!

1442
01:24:27.496 --> 01:24:28.976
- Dad!
- Oh. thank God.

1443
01:24:29.107 --> 01:24:31.414
- Oh my goodness.
- Oh. thank God.

1444
01:24:31.501 --> 01:24:33.416
Oh my God.
Are you okay?

1445
01:24:33.503 --> 01:24:34.591
Come on. come on.

1446
01:24:34.678 --> 01:24:35.418
We gotta go. we gotta go.
we gotta go.

1447
01:24:37.594 --> 01:24:38.550
Let's go.

1448
01:24:43.425 --> 01:24:45.818
I'm just saying
Mrs. Dr. Brad Redford

1449
01:24:45.906 --> 01:24:47.778
sounds extra right.

1450
01:24:47.907 --> 01:24:49.300
You are the only person I know

1451
01:24:49.388 --> 01:24:50.693
that can have
a near death experience

1452
01:24:50.824 --> 01:24:52.043
and turn it into a meet-cute.

1453
01:24:53.478 --> 01:24:54.437
Take notes. young one.

1454
01:24:54.567 --> 01:24:56.352
Um. absolutely not.

1455
01:24:58.223 --> 01:25:00.791
Oh. by the way. uh.
Mrs. Fielding's cat.

1456
01:25:00.921 --> 01:25:02.097
she just finished having
another litter.

1457
01:25:02.227 --> 01:25:03.924
in case you're interested. so.

1458
01:25:04.011 --> 01:25:05.404
I read an article once

1459
01:25:05.491 --> 01:25:07.841
that cats are a gateway
to BDSM.

1460
01:25:07.972 --> 01:25:09.669
-No. no. no. no. no.
-No. no. no. no. no.

1461
01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:11.758
-Please ignore her.
-Okay. I'm kidding.

1462
01:25:11.889 --> 01:25:12.803
Not about the cat thing though.

1463
01:25:12.933 --> 01:25:13.978
Seriously.
you should look it up.

1464
01:25:16.327 --> 01:25:17.895
So. is that a yes?

1465
01:25:19.114 --> 01:25:20.898
You know. I'm good.

1466
01:25:20.985 --> 01:25:22.552
I have all the family
I need right here.

1467
01:25:24.075 --> 01:25:27.252
Did you really just say that
out loud?

1468
01:25:27.339 --> 01:25:29.472
Okay. it sounded a lot less
corny in my head.

1469
01:25:29.602 --> 01:25:31.343
But give me your mama a pass.

1470
01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:36.740
Is that Gavin's biological mom?

1471
01:25:37.958 --> 01:25:39.438
Yeah. sweety. it is.

1472
01:25:42.311 --> 01:25:43.616
Um. give me one second.

1473
01:25:43.746 --> 01:25:44.704
I'll be right back.

1474
01:25:44.835 --> 01:25:45.662
Okay.

1475
01:25:50.493 --> 01:25:52.669
-Hi.
-Hi.

1476
01:25:52.799 --> 01:25:54.105
I hope this is okay. us talking.

1477
01:25:54.192 --> 01:25:56.020
Oh. of course.

1478
01:25:56.107 --> 01:25:56.977
I just don't really know
the rules

1479
01:25:57.064 --> 01:25:58.196
for this kind of thing.

1480
01:25:58.327 --> 01:25:59.502
Me neither.

1481
01:26:00.719 --> 01:26:02.548
Oh. hi.

1482
01:26:02.679 --> 01:26:05.246
-It's okay.
-Can I please play with Gavin?

1483
01:26:05.377 --> 01:26:06.422
-Uh...
-Please?

1484
01:26:06.509 --> 01:26:07.466
Oh. yes. of course.

1485
01:26:07.597 --> 01:26:08.598
I think he would love that.

1486
01:26:12.297 --> 01:26:15.082
I'm Cynthia. by the way.

1487
01:26:15.213 --> 01:26:16.648
-Oh. Bethany.
-It's so nice to meet you.

1488
01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:18.389
So nice to meet you. too.

1489
01:26:18.521 --> 01:26:19.739
Hi. Cynthia.

1490
01:26:19.826 --> 01:26:21.523
Nice to meet you.

1491
01:26:21.654 --> 01:26:24.222
Oh baby. I missed you so much!

1492
01:26:24.353 --> 01:26:25.963
Look at you.

1493
01:26:26.093 --> 01:26:28.705
Hey. buddy.

1494
01:26:30.532 --> 01:26:31.925
-Let's go play.
-Yeah. come on.

1495
01:26:32.056 --> 01:26:33.536
What? Whoa. whoa. hey!

1496
01:26:33.666 --> 01:26:34.885
Oh. okay.

1497
01:26:38.105 --> 01:26:39.933
Good. just adjusting.
