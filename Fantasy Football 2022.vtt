2009 NFL season is underway.

10
00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:40.908

host the Miami Dolphins.

in as running back.

00:00:45.346 --> 00:00:46.714
Handoff. Coleman.

14
00:00:46.814 --> 00:00:49.517
Oh. and Coleman.
right off the bat. fumbles it...

15
00:00:49.617 --> 00:00:51.619
[Keisha] That's my dad.
Bobby Coleman.

16
00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.388
Not how anyone expected
his career to start.

17
00:00:54.488 --> 00:00:55.489
Might have been
his first fumble.

18
00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:58.058
but it wasn't his last.

19
00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:01.529
Because of that. I ended up
moving around...a lot.

20
00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.265
I turned six in Indianapolis.

21
00:01:04.365 --> 00:01:05.833
Eight was in Chicago.

22
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.301

Bobby Coleman coughs up the ball

23
00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:09.737
for the Bears. and
the Raiders recover.

24
00:01:09.837 --> 00:01:11.905
[Callie] Then we were on to
Jacksonville for my tenth.

25
00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:14.642
but you can probably
guess what happened.

26
00:01:14.742 --> 00:01:16.510
[Commentator] And then
the football comes loose.

27
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.912
[Callie] The big 1-3
was in Minneapolis.

28
00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:20.481
I wasn't there long
enough to make friends.

29
00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:23.751
but I did perfect my
Madden skills.

30
00:01:23.851 --> 00:01:25.553
Twelve years after
that first fumble.

31
00:01:25.653 --> 00:01:27.521
we ended up in Atlanta.

32
00:01:27.621 --> 00:01:29.690
What I didn't know was.
I was about to have

33
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.725
the weirdest year of my life.

close out the preseason.

00:01:35.663 --> 00:01:38.599

will Bobby Coleman--

36
00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:41.535
Keisha. why are
you watching that?

37
00:01:41.635 --> 00:01:44.272
Come on.
Don't listen to 'em.

38
00:01:44.372 --> 00:01:45.606
Listen to me.

39
00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:46.840
They don't know what
they're talking about.

40
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:47.975
Well. I hope so.

41
00:01:48.075 --> 00:01:49.910
because we've already
moved so many times.

42
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.145
and it's a lot!

43
00:01:51.245 --> 00:01:52.280
Look. I don't like picking up

44
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.781
and shuffling to
a new city either.

45
00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:54.882
I know one thing--

46
00:01:54.982 --> 00:01:56.083
if Anderson Fisher
wasn't on the team.

47
00:01:56.184 --> 00:01:57.518
I'd definitely make the roster.

48
00:01:57.618 --> 00:01:58.886
No. you need to stop
worrying about everyone else

49
00:01:58.986 --> 00:02:01.489
and maybe start thinking about
what life might look like

50
00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:02.923
-after football.
-Whoa. whoa. whoa.

51
00:02:03.023 --> 00:02:05.593
Did you just use those words
I think I heard you say?

52
00:02:05.693 --> 00:02:07.395
Coaches seen me put in
the work this preseason.

53
00:02:07.495 --> 00:02:08.829
Come on. baby.

54
00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.498
I've been killing myself
to be ready for this season.

55
00:02:10.598 --> 00:02:12.233
and you think I'm done.
But I'm just getting started.

56
00:02:12.333 --> 00:02:13.501
No. baby. that's
not what I said.

57
00:02:13.601 --> 00:02:15.769
But I can't take another trade.

58
00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:17.538
So that better be

We can grow old here.

-Okay.
-Okay.

and twelve. versus Coleman.

62
00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:28.516
And back to the Lions.

63
00:02:28.616 --> 00:02:31.885
And he'll play four
at the 27-yard line.

Not cool.

66
00:02:36.657 --> 00:02:37.691

67
00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:39.860
I saw you in the reflection.

68
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.462
-You did?
-Mm-hmm.

69
00:02:41.562 --> 00:02:42.763
You really gotta
step up your game.

70
00:02:42.863 --> 00:02:44.432
-I guess so.
-[Callie] Yeah.

71
00:02:44.532 --> 00:02:46.600
-So no more cinnamon rolls.
-What do you mean?

72
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.801
If you wanna make the roster.

73
00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:49.470
you gotta be at
peak physical condition.

74
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.004
Oh. come on. Callie. it's
the last day of preseason!

75
00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:52.039
Uh-uh. no buts.

76
00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:53.507
Look. we've been
down this road before.

77
00:02:53.607 --> 00:02:55.209
First it's cinnamon rolls.

78
00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:56.610
Then late-night Cap'n Crunch.

79
00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.879
Then I find you hoarding
Oreos under the bathroom sink.

80
00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:00.981

better when it's secret.

81
00:03:01.081 --> 00:03:02.750

and you play video games.

85
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.422
Am I wrong?

86
00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:10.123
No. that's why I have
a high OBR in Madden.

87
00:03:10.224 --> 00:03:11.925
You know what I was doing
when I was your age?

88
00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:14.094
[imitates old guy] Oh. when
I was your age. I used to...

89
00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:17.365
-go outside.
-[laughs]

90
00:03:17.465 --> 00:03:18.699

hurt to get out there

91
00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.235
and make a few friends.
You know?

92
00:03:21.335 --> 00:03:23.671

all this moving around.

93
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:25.172

every girl's dream

94

95
00:03:26.607 --> 00:03:29.009
like her family's a bunch
of wanted bank robbers?

96
00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:30.811
-A fair hit.
-Mm-hmm.

97
00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:32.980
But I feel different
about Atlanta. baby girl.

98
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.149
I'm telling you. I think
we gonna be here for a while.

99
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.287
Yeah. I've heard
that one before.

100
00:03:39.387 --> 00:03:41.822
But it would be nice

101
00:03:41.922 --> 00:03:44.492
to finally
call a city home for once.

102
00:03:48.362 --> 00:03:50.230
-Guess what?
-Hmm?

103
00:03:50.331 --> 00:03:52.700
I couldn't agree more.

104
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.304
I don't wanna keep being
the reason we move.

105
00:03:56.404 --> 00:03:58.005
Good.

106
00:03:58.105 --> 00:04:00.007
-Oh. can I show you something?
-Of course.

107
00:04:00.107 --> 00:04:03.377
Okay. so I've been working
on some predictive analytics

108
00:04:03.477 --> 00:04:05.112
to help prepare you
for your first game.

109
00:04:05.212 --> 00:04:07.348
Okay. I have no idea what that
is. but I love the sound of it.

110
00:04:07.448 --> 00:04:09.717
All right. so basically. it
all comes down to 0's and 1's.

111
00:04:09.817 --> 00:04:11.084
-Okay.
-I catalogued

112
00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:12.986
all the Falcons styles
from the past season.

113
00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:15.456
They're efficient. they get a 1.
Non-efficient. they get a 0.

114
00:04:15.556 --> 00:04:17.691
So I loaded that data
into this spreadsheet

115
00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:20.294
and coded an algorithm in
Python that can predict...

116
00:04:20.394 --> 00:04:23.263
-[laughs]
-What?

117
00:04:23.364 --> 00:04:26.467
Just--I'm just so proud of you.
You and your numbers.

118
00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:29.770
-You just keep getting smarter.
-Are you--are you listening?

119
00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.739
-Yes. Daughter. I'm listening.
-Okay. so...

No. no. no. no.
whoo-ah. none of that.

132
00:04:54.795 --> 00:04:57.064

pretending to pass the ball to

you're trying to be slick.

You're not about to drive. no.

license three weeks.

have a panic attack.

138

It's okay. you got this.

149

-[Teacher] You're doing great.
-They are always like this.

150

Bunch of jerks.

151
00:05:32.933 --> 00:05:34.835
Ugh. I wish someone
would teach them a lesson.

152
00:05:34.935 --> 00:05:35.936
For real.

remedial gym class. maybe?

160
00:05:54.422 --> 00:05:55.989
Gonna get this.

161
00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:58.492
You're actually gonna try again?

[Coach Evans] Bobby. you've
been a real workhorse for us

166
00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:14.408
this preseason.

167
00:06:14.508 --> 00:06:18.311
We've been impressed by
your hustle and determination.

168
00:06:18.412 --> 00:06:20.681
And that's why we wanna keep
you right here in the lineup.

169
00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:22.382
Yes! I knew it. Coach.

170
00:06:22.483 --> 00:06:26.219
-But on the practice squad.
-Okay.

171
00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:29.590
Listen. you're a hard worker
and a veteran leader.

172
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.825

173
00:06:31.925 --> 00:06:34.094
Right. right.
I mean. I love the locker room.

174
00:06:34.194 --> 00:06:36.029
And great water pressure
in the shower. by the way.

175
00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:37.130
I mean. wow.

176
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.933
But just as an idea.
Coach. you know...

177
00:06:40.033 --> 00:06:42.636
wouldn't it be better if that
hard work and veteran leadership

178
00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:45.873
you speak about was being
used on the field. right?

179
00:06:45.973 --> 00:06:49.577
Out there. not...in there.
You know?

180
00:06:49.677 --> 00:06:51.078
All right. listen. Bobby.

181
00:06:51.178 --> 00:06:54.948
And. uh. don't take this
the wrong way. but...

182
00:06:55.048 --> 00:06:57.785
your Heisman days
are far behind you.

183
00:06:57.885 --> 00:06:59.953
And with the league
trending past firsts.

184
00:07:00.053 --> 00:07:02.422
we're just gonna keep
two backs active.

185
00:07:02.523 --> 00:07:04.492
So. we've got Allen.

186
00:07:04.592 --> 00:07:06.760
and obviously
Anderson's a no-brainer.

187
00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.562
Ha. ha!
Are you kidding me. Coach?

188
00:07:08.662 --> 00:07:10.330
I mean. the guy's a phenom.

189
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.500
He is. he is.

190
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.935
Well. thank you.
Coach. you know?

191
00:07:15.035 --> 00:07:16.537
For giving it to me
straight. you know?

192
00:07:16.637 --> 00:07:18.472
With no chaser.
I can appreciate that.

193
00:07:18.572 --> 00:07:19.907
I knew you'd take the news well.

194
00:07:20.007 --> 00:07:21.975
[sobs]

195
00:07:22.075 --> 00:07:26.379
Baby. I need you to
take a deep breath.

196
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.416
I know it hurts. but
it's just temporary.

197
00:07:29.517 --> 00:07:30.684
And so what?

198
00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:32.085
Anderson Fisher
had one great year.

199
00:07:32.185 --> 00:07:34.154
It's not like it makes him
the face of the Falcons.

200
00:07:36.524 --> 00:07:39.793
[sobs]

201
00:07:39.893 --> 00:07:41.328
[Keisha] Baby. are
you gonna be okay?

202
00:07:41.428 --> 00:07:42.796
Yeah.

203
00:07:42.896 --> 00:07:44.131
'Cause I don't want
you crashing the car

204
00:07:44.231 --> 00:07:45.566
'cause you can't see the
road through your tears.

205
00:07:45.666 --> 00:07:46.867
[tapping on window]
Yo!

206
00:07:46.967 --> 00:07:49.903
Keish. I gotta go. okay?
I'll see ya.

207
00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:54.274
-Yo. yo. yo.
-Hey. Anderson. what's up. man?

208
00:07:54.374 --> 00:07:56.243
-You see that banner up there?
-Oh yeah.

209
00:07:56.343 --> 00:07:58.245
It's a big me!

210
00:07:58.345 --> 00:08:00.113
-Look how big I am. dog!
-I know. huh.

211
00:08:00.213 --> 00:08:01.515
[Anderson] Yo. you
know. maybe next time.

212
00:08:01.615 --> 00:08:03.817
I'll be posing for the
wax museum version of myself.

213
00:08:03.917 --> 00:08:05.519
What stance do you
think I should do?

214
00:08:05.619 --> 00:08:07.020
-That's cool.
-Hold up. hold up.

215
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.889
-Yeah. that's cool.
-Are you all right?

216
00:08:08.989 --> 00:08:12.259
Oh. yeah. Oh. yeah.

217
00:08:12.359 --> 00:08:15.362
Oh. man. there's just
allergies. you know?

218
00:08:15.462 --> 00:08:17.698
It must be pollinating the
whole parking lot. though.

219
00:08:17.798 --> 00:08:19.232
-What?
-Yeah. yeah.

220
00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:20.634
-Word.
-Yeah. word.

221
00:08:20.734 --> 00:08:23.336
-Who?
-You know...

222
00:08:23.436 --> 00:08:25.606
bees.

223
00:08:25.706 --> 00:08:27.207
-Bzzz?
-Bees.

224
00:08:27.307 --> 00:08:28.441
Bzzz.

225
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:33.113
Right. Listen. man.

226
00:08:33.213 --> 00:08:34.948
crying ain't nothin'
to be ashamed of.

227
00:08:35.048 --> 00:08:37.585
Embrace your feelings.
You wanna hug it out?

228
00:08:37.685 --> 00:08:39.452
No.

229
00:08:39.553 --> 00:08:40.821
I'm a good hugger. right?

230
00:08:40.921 --> 00:08:42.022
-It's tight.
-Yeah--

231
00:08:42.122 --> 00:08:43.423
But it's not too
tight. all right?

232
00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:45.325
You can feel safe and secure
in these arms. I promise.

233
00:08:45.425 --> 00:08:47.327
I hear you.
Maybe next time. all right?

234
00:08:47.427 --> 00:08:48.428
-Done?
-Yep. that's it.

235
00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:49.897
I wanted to remind you about

236
00:08:49.997 --> 00:08:52.232
my end of preseason
party at my crib. right?

237
00:08:52.332 --> 00:08:54.334
You and the whole
family is invited.

238
00:08:54.434 --> 00:08:56.469
I want everyone to get the whole
Anderson Fisher experience.

239
00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:58.405
Well. I'm not too sure.
you know. what we got going on

240
00:08:58.505 --> 00:09:00.073
or whatever. but I'll
check with the wife.

241
00:09:00.173 --> 00:09:02.075
You don't wanna miss out
on these finger foods.

242
00:09:02.175 --> 00:09:03.944
Oh. you just gonna
roll that down. huh?

243
00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:06.647
I'm talking deconstructed
carnival fare. all right?

244
00:09:06.747 --> 00:09:08.215
-But listen. Sniffles.
-Hm?

245
00:09:08.315 --> 00:09:09.783
Go get some
24-hour relief. man.

246
00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:11.151
-Hey. cloud that up.
-Uh-huh.

247
00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:12.886
-Suck it up. dry it out.
-Yeah. dry it out.

248
00:09:12.986 --> 00:09:15.623
-[Anderson] You got it. baby.
-All right. man. Yeah.

249
00:09:15.723 --> 00:09:19.593
[music]

250
00:09:19.693 --> 00:09:22.830
Hey. new girl!
Wait up!

251
00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:25.766
It's Callie. right?

252
00:09:25.866 --> 00:09:29.703
Uh. yeah. that's
actually my name. yeah.

253
00:09:29.803 --> 00:09:33.473
I'm Kayla.
And this is Zoe and Margo.

254
00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:37.144
We just had to ask.
How did you pull that off?

255
00:09:37.244 --> 00:09:38.812
I didn't--
I didn't do anything.

256
00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:40.113
Right. right.

257
00:09:40.213 --> 00:09:41.649
Yeah. no. I'm gonna
need every single detail

258
00:09:41.749 --> 00:09:43.250
of what just what down.

259
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:46.787
So. we were talking.
and we were wondering. um.

260
00:09:46.887 --> 00:09:49.422
if--if. you know--if--
it's up to you--

261
00:09:49.522 --> 00:09:51.124
If you feel like it would
be in your best interest--

262
00:09:51.224 --> 00:09:53.627
-We're on a robotics team.
-[Zoe] Yeah.

263
00:09:53.727 --> 00:09:55.929
Robotics?

264
00:09:56.029 --> 00:09:57.931
Like. you guys build robots?

265
00:09:58.031 --> 00:09:59.800
Yep! I'm team captain.

266
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.202
We meet on Tuesdays
and Thursdays at 4:30.

267
00:10:02.302 --> 00:10:05.172
And based off of
what we saw today--

268
00:10:05.272 --> 00:10:09.142
that thing that you
definitely didn't do--

269
00:10:09.242 --> 00:10:14.414
well. whoever did do that
might wanna come check us out.

270
00:10:14.514 --> 00:10:16.416
Okay. Yeah. yeah. cool.

271
00:10:16.516 --> 00:10:20.453
I mean. um. whoever did
that would probably say

272
00:10:20.553 --> 00:10:24.491
thanks for the invite and.
uh. they'll think about it.

273
00:10:24.591 --> 00:10:26.526
Awesome. yeah. Thanks.

274
00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:28.996

290
00:11:05.933 --> 00:11:07.267
Hey. hey.

291
00:11:09.803 --> 00:11:11.171
What's up?
How are you doin'?

292
00:11:11.271 --> 00:11:13.206
Hey. you let me know if this
music too loud. all right?

293
00:11:13.306 --> 00:11:15.776
This must be Callie
and the beautiful Keisha.

294
00:11:15.876 --> 00:11:17.477
Cheeseburger on a stick?
Beef and cheddar

295
00:11:17.577 --> 00:11:19.980
tucked in a hash brown ball.
fried golden brown.

296
00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.182
-Sounds delicious.
-Yes. please.

297
00:11:22.282 --> 00:11:24.451
You see. they got good taste.

298
00:11:24.551 --> 00:11:27.187
Welcome to my wonderland!

299
00:11:27.287 --> 00:11:29.923
Custom built by the same
guy who did three of

300
00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:31.992
Robert Downey Jr's six houses.

301
00:11:32.092 --> 00:11:33.226
I have to show you
my home theater.

302
00:11:33.326 --> 00:11:34.494
Oh no. man.
we're cool right here.

303
00:11:34.594 --> 00:11:35.863
It just got installed.

304
00:11:35.963 --> 00:11:37.297
Guys in there playing
Madden right now.

305
00:11:37.397 --> 00:11:40.300
I should warn you. Callie.
she's mean on that Madden.

306
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.235
-Takes no prisoners.
-Oh yeah?

307
00:11:42.335 --> 00:11:44.071
She must be playing as me.

308
00:11:44.171 --> 00:11:46.006
You know I got the
overall 100 rating. right?

309
00:11:46.106 --> 00:11:49.109
-You know. AF keep it 100!
-Yeah.

310
00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:51.611
Except nobody's got a
perfect 100 rating in Madden .

311
00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:53.480
Uh. Dad. he actually does.

312
00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.048
Yeah. they're saying
I'm the first one.

313
00:11:55.148 --> 00:11:56.984
You know. pioneer
and all of that.

314
00:11:57.084 --> 00:11:58.986
You know. create
milestones and all of that.

315
00:11:59.086 --> 00:12:00.320
Uh. what about you?

316
00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.022
What's. uh...
What's your rating?

317
00:12:02.122 --> 00:12:04.491
-72?
-He's a 67.

318
00:12:04.591 --> 00:12:05.525
[Anderson] Dang!

319
00:12:05.625 --> 00:12:08.361
I mean. that's tough.

320
00:12:08.461 --> 00:12:10.030
Well. you know.
at least on Madden.

321
00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:11.531
you're not stuck
in a locker room.

322
00:12:11.631 --> 00:12:13.767
You're actually on
the field with me.

323
00:12:13.867 --> 00:12:17.938
Behold. the home theater!
[laughs]

324
00:12:18.038 --> 00:12:20.841
Hey. yo. listen up!
This is Callie Coleman.

325
00:12:20.941 --> 00:12:23.243
She got next. all right?
Go easy on her.

326
00:12:23.343 --> 00:12:25.012
More like I'll go easy on them.

327
00:12:25.112 --> 00:12:27.380
[Guys] Whoa!

328
00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.116
Let me show you how
it works at the crib.

329
00:12:29.216 --> 00:12:31.351
So yeah. you know. the floors
are imported zebra wood.

330
00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:33.686
You look up. ceiling.
white marble.

331
00:12:33.787 --> 00:12:37.057
I said. whatever they gave
Michelangelo. give me that.

332
00:12:37.157 --> 00:12:38.525
That's me.

333
00:12:40.227 --> 00:12:42.029
It's a little
embarrassing. uh...

334
00:12:42.129 --> 00:12:43.263
So they made some
bobbleheads of me.

335
00:12:43.363 --> 00:12:45.866
I got a couple
advance copies.

336
00:12:45.966 --> 00:12:47.334
So yeah. that's
my knitting room.

337
00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:48.701
Uh. a lot of people
don't know this.

338
00:12:48.802 --> 00:12:51.138
but I'm actually really
good at making mittens.

339
00:12:51.238 --> 00:12:55.142
[water flowing]

340
00:12:55.242 --> 00:12:59.112
This is my rookie year
single-season rushing record.

341
00:12:59.212 --> 00:13:01.214
Had to put it somewhere.

342
00:13:01.314 --> 00:13:04.284
You know. Anderson. pride is
one of the seven deadly sins.

343
00:13:04.384 --> 00:13:07.320
Yeah. well. so is gluttony.
but that ain't stop you.

344
00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:08.889
[laughs] No. just
messing with you. man.

345
00:13:08.989 --> 00:13:10.757
It's probably 'cause
the shirt's small.

346
00:13:10.858 --> 00:13:12.425
You know. I'll be
honest with you.

347
00:13:12.525 --> 00:13:14.327
I actually thought
this rushing record

348
00:13:14.427 --> 00:13:16.263
was gonna be yours the
year you won the Heisman.

349
00:13:16.363 --> 00:13:17.530
-Word?
-Yeah. man.

350
00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.033
-You were my favorite player.
-Yeah?

351
00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:21.969
Yeah. don't doubt. man.
We all loved you.

352
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:23.770
The whole fifth grade.

353
00:13:23.871 --> 00:13:26.073
Yo. let me get those
deconstructed cotton candies!

354
00:13:26.173 --> 00:13:27.707
-I'll get one too.
-[Anderson] Yo. hold up!

355
00:13:32.045 --> 00:13:33.646
[crowd cheering]

356
00:13:33.746 --> 00:13:34.882
[Callie] Whoo!

357
00:13:34.982 --> 00:13:36.616
I warned you I was
an expert in that.

358
00:13:36.716 --> 00:13:39.519
Did this girl invent the game?
How did you get this good?

359
00:13:39.619 --> 00:13:41.922
I think the real question
is how did you get so bad?

360
00:13:42.022 --> 00:13:44.057
[Group] Whoa!

361
00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:45.825
[Callie] It's all right.
Maybe next time. man.

362
00:13:45.926 --> 00:13:47.160
Everyone say bye!

363
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.129
-[Group] Bye!
-Bye.

364
00:13:49.229 --> 00:13:50.563
Have a good one.

365
00:13:52.332 --> 00:13:55.969
All right. um. who's next?
Anybody else?

366
00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:58.105
-Uh. uh. all right.
-Yo. Anderson?

367
00:13:58.205 --> 00:13:59.739
I think it's only.
you know. fair

368
00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:02.442
that the man who owns
the home "the-a-ta"

369
00:14:02.542 --> 00:14:04.811
takes a turn.
What you say?

370
00:14:04.912 --> 00:14:08.248
[shouting]

371
00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:10.217
All right. cool. cool.
let's get it. let's get it.

372
00:14:10.317 --> 00:14:12.485
Let's see what
you got. Lil Coleman.

373
00:14:14.254 --> 00:14:16.756
* This is the beginnin'
of the new world. baby *

374
00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:19.326
[Group] Whoa!

375
00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.029
Get him. Callie!

376
00:14:22.129 --> 00:14:23.663
Button's stuck. man!

377
00:14:23.763 --> 00:14:24.898
* Superman did it

378
00:14:24.998 --> 00:14:26.166
* Passion of a G

379
00:14:26.266 --> 00:14:27.667
* Sittin' like a soldier

380
00:14:27.767 --> 00:14:31.304
[Group] [groaning]

381
00:14:32.572 --> 00:14:34.141
No. no. no. no!
I pressed--

382
00:14:34.241 --> 00:14:35.408
Hey. yo. come on.

383
00:14:35.508 --> 00:14:36.910
My control--
I was lagging. man.

384
00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:38.378
That's tough.

385
00:14:38.478 --> 00:14:40.247
Is it rude for me to
clown the host at the party?

386
00:14:40.347 --> 00:14:41.314
Or should I--

387
00:14:41.414 --> 00:14:42.849
[indistinct chatter]

388
00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:45.318
Hey. Are you gonna let her
fight all your battles or...

389
00:14:45.418 --> 00:14:46.853
you gonna come play me yourself?

390
00:14:46.954 --> 00:14:48.555
[chuckles]

391
00:14:50.257 --> 00:14:51.691
I got no problem with it.

392
00:14:51.791 --> 00:14:53.893
Long as you don't mind getting
beat by two Colemans in one day.

393
00:14:53.994 --> 00:14:57.965
[Group] [exclaiming]

394
00:14:58.065 --> 00:15:00.000
Okay. chill out.
chill out. chill out.

395
00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.768
You know what?
Since Bobby Coleman here

396
00:15:01.868 --> 00:15:04.004
has seniority. right?

397
00:15:04.104 --> 00:15:07.407
A lot of seniority.
He don't look old.

398
00:15:07.507 --> 00:15:10.243
I'ma let you play
as me. Anderson Fisher.

399
00:15:10.343 --> 00:15:11.811
Man. shut up.
I ain't gonna play as you.

400
00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:13.346
I'm gonna play as Bobby Coleman.

401
00:15:13.446 --> 00:15:15.315
And I'm gonna school ya.

402
00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:20.320
[thunder rumbling]
[rain hitting windshield]

403
00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:23.957
[Callie] [coughs]

404
00:15:24.057 --> 00:15:26.293
Hey. Dad.
You gotta admit.

405
00:15:26.393 --> 00:15:28.861
It's kind of funny
that you lost by 86 points.

406
00:15:28.962 --> 00:15:30.430
I mean. I've never seen it.

407
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.199
Well. look. I-I
don't find the humor.

408
00:15:32.299 --> 00:15:34.601
And a man humiliated me
in front of all my peers.

409
00:15:34.701 --> 00:15:36.703
That was a direct attack
on my entire person.

410
00:15:36.803 --> 00:15:40.107
-Oh! Your entire person?
-Yes. Keisha.

411
00:15:40.207 --> 00:15:41.474
That was an attack
on my manhood.

412
00:15:41.574 --> 00:15:43.043
And I'm supposed to
just sit there and laugh

413
00:15:43.143 --> 00:15:44.144
like it's some kind of game?
Nuh-uh.

414
00:15:44.244 --> 00:15:47.547
It's literally a video game!

415
00:15:47.647 --> 00:15:49.782
Isn't that right.
Bobblehead Anderson?

416
00:15:49.882 --> 00:15:51.451
[imitating Anderson] Um.
that is correct. Keisha.

417
00:15:51.551 --> 00:15:53.520
Keisha. he gave you that
and you didn't burn it?

418
00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.555
Never say no to
a swag bag. baby.

419
00:15:55.655 --> 00:15:57.057
-Wait. wait!
-He's comin'.

420
00:15:57.157 --> 00:15:58.858
Uh. uh! Uh. uh!

421
00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.160
[Keisha] [laughs]

422
00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.062
You better get some
ice for this sore loser!

423
00:16:02.162 --> 00:16:03.296
[laughter]

424
00:16:03.396 --> 00:16:06.133
Poor guy's only a 67.
and mad.

425
00:16:06.233 --> 00:16:08.635
Ha. ha. ha. ha. yeah. okay.
Just laugh. huh?

426
00:16:08.735 --> 00:16:10.837
-[Callie] [laughs]
-Oh. that's how it's gonna be.

427
00:16:10.937 --> 00:16:12.039
Hang you up.

428
00:16:12.139 --> 00:16:14.174
Make fun of Bobby.
Make fun.

429
00:16:14.274 --> 00:16:16.376
Bobby Coleman.
everybody laughing.

430
00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:20.047
-Don't. babe.
-Anderson is not so bad.

431
00:16:20.147 --> 00:16:22.182
He gave me a copy of his Madden .

432
00:16:22.282 --> 00:16:23.350
-He gave you what?
-[Callie] He signed it.

433
00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:25.152
And he signed it?
[stutters]

434
00:16:25.252 --> 00:16:27.354
But--no. stop!

435
00:16:27.454 --> 00:16:29.522
I'm not lookin' at the road.
I'm about to pull over.

436
00:16:29.622 --> 00:16:31.524
[Keisha] Give me the game.
Bobby. give me the game.

437
00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:33.693
[Bobby] Y'all
have gone crazy

438
00:16:33.793 --> 00:16:35.462
if you think I'm
bringing this to my house.

439
00:16:35.562 --> 00:16:37.864
This game is not
coming into my house!

440
00:16:37.964 --> 00:16:38.965
Throwing it out!

441
00:16:39.066 --> 00:16:42.235
[Callie] What? What?
No!

442
00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:44.204
-Wait. wait.
-Throwing it away.

443
00:16:44.304 --> 00:16:46.139
-Dad! Seriously?
-Yes. seriously!

444
00:16:46.239 --> 00:16:47.340
No. it's just a game!

445
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.575
-No. it's more than a game.
-Stop!

446
00:16:48.675 --> 00:16:49.942
-What are you doing?
-What is wrong with you?

447
00:16:50.043 --> 00:16:52.279
-We were just joking!
-Don't you get it. Keish?

448
00:16:52.379 --> 00:16:54.481
That man has the life
we were supposed to have.

449
00:16:54.581 --> 00:16:57.050
Had I broken that rushing record
and gotten that big contract.

450
00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:58.285
that would be our house!

451
00:16:58.385 --> 00:16:59.586
No. but instead.
I've been dragging you

452
00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:02.289
all around the country for what?
Huh?

453
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:04.224
Bobby's a big disappointment!
I'm a joke!

454
00:17:04.324 --> 00:17:06.059
I got no endorsement deals!

455
00:17:06.159 --> 00:17:07.760
I'm not even in
the conversation!

456
00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:09.229
It should've been us!

457
00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:11.364
[zapping]

458
00:17:11.464 --> 00:17:12.899
[Keisha] What the...

459
00:17:15.735 --> 00:17:17.337
Are y'all okay!?

460
00:17:17.437 --> 00:17:19.439
Callie! Callie. look at me!

461
00:17:20.307 --> 00:17:23.009
Am I. am I. am I. am I alive?

462
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:24.111
I'm alive!

463
00:17:24.211 --> 00:17:26.479
-Can you hear me?
-Is she alive?

464
00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:28.281
You okay? You okay?

465
00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:30.617
Yeah. I'm actually--
I'm actually fine.

466
00:17:30.717 --> 00:17:33.486
Thank God. That was crazy!

467
00:17:33.586 --> 00:17:35.422
What is wrong with you two?

468
00:17:35.522 --> 00:17:36.889
We could be in the ER right now.

469
00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:38.958
Don't you have anything
to say to each other?

470
00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:40.460
Well. Bobby?

471
00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.395
-What? She started it!
-She started it!?

472
00:17:42.495 --> 00:17:46.466
Baby. you are a grown man.

473
00:17:46.566 --> 00:17:49.169
My bad for making fun of
your rating in Madden .

474
00:17:49.269 --> 00:17:51.304
I'm sorry.

475
00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:55.975
My bad for losing my temper.
I'm sorry.

476
00:17:56.075 --> 00:17:58.878
Well. I'm gonna have to
see a hug or something.

477
00:18:02.315 --> 00:18:04.083
Like. you mean it!

478
00:18:08.488 --> 00:18:13.726
[tender music]

479
00:18:13.826 --> 00:18:15.762
-Sorry.
-All right. let's get inside.

480
00:18:18.831 --> 00:18:20.133
Wait.

481
00:18:22.535 --> 00:18:24.070
Come on. baby.
it's raining so hard!

482
00:18:24.171 --> 00:18:25.638
Come on. let's go!

483
00:18:25.738 --> 00:18:27.907
[Callie] It's still perfect.

Let's go!
Let's go!

488
00:18:48.161 --> 00:18:50.797
Whoo! Ha. ha. ha.

489
00:18:50.897 --> 00:18:52.098
[Man] All right.
Chris. one more time!

490
00:18:52.199 --> 00:18:53.800
Hey. man.
You know. at your age.

491
00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.702
it's not even about
finishing first.

492
00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:57.304
It's about finishing at all.

493
00:18:57.404 --> 00:18:59.539
We are all proud of you.

494
00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:01.874
You know. it's like watching
an old dog go up some stairs.

495
00:19:01.974 --> 00:19:03.243
Like. you don't
think he'll make it.

496
00:19:03.343 --> 00:19:04.777
but somehow the little
rascal digs deep?

497
00:19:04.877 --> 00:19:06.646
That's you. man!
You're digging deep!

498
00:19:06.746 --> 00:19:07.880
[Coach Evans] Starters!
You guys take a break.

499
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.650

let's run some formations.

00:19:30.303 --> 00:19:32.339

-Woo!

517

Yeah. Bobby!

518
00:20:05.672 --> 00:20:07.507
Somebody ate their
Wheaties today. boy!

519
00:20:07.607 --> 00:20:08.675
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

520
00:20:08.775 --> 00:20:10.543
I like that!
I like that!

521
00:20:10.643 --> 00:20:11.844
I've never seen
him do that before.

522
00:20:11.944 --> 00:20:13.112
Never.

523
00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:21.153
* Everything has gotta be
cool when we livin' some fun *

524
00:20:21.254 --> 00:20:22.555
* Feel it in your bones

00:20:22.655 --> 00:20:25.224

528
00:20:30.863 --> 00:20:32.632
[phone notification chime.
buzzing]

529
00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:34.734
* Caught up in my
feelings. now I'm froze *

530
00:20:34.834 --> 00:20:36.135
Yeah!

531
00:20:38.004 --> 00:20:42.208
Old dog teaching the young
pup new things out here today!

532
00:20:42.309 --> 00:20:44.811
-That's luck.
-Bobby?

533
00:20:44.911 --> 00:20:47.914
Let's have a chat in my office.

534
00:20:48.014 --> 00:20:49.081
Hey. yo.

535
00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:50.350
Yes sir. Coach!

536
00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:51.418
[knocking]

537
00:20:51.518 --> 00:20:53.320
Callie! Hey!

538
00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:57.156
We have been talking about
that sprinkler stunt non stop!

539
00:20:57.256 --> 00:20:58.458
-Really?
-Yeah.

540
00:20:58.558 --> 00:21:00.393
Well. I mean. it
wasn't that impressive.

541
00:21:00.493 --> 00:21:02.028
Smart and humble.

542
00:21:02.128 --> 00:21:03.830
I'm gonna need you to be
a little cockier. though.

543
00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:06.766
like stand firm in your
power and abilities. yeah?

544
00:21:08.835 --> 00:21:11.438
That's Oliver.
He's a little reserved.

545
00:21:11.538 --> 00:21:14.741
Doesn't talk. really.

546
00:21:14.841 --> 00:21:18.244
More of a...supportive
head nod guy.

547
00:21:18.345 --> 00:21:20.480
Right. Oliver?

548
00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:21.814
I know. I know. sorry I'm late.

549
00:21:21.914 --> 00:21:25.017
I didn't--oh. whoa.
Hey.

550
00:21:25.117 --> 00:21:26.519
Hi.

551
00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:28.087
Look. sorry for running
into you and all that.

552
00:21:28.187 --> 00:21:29.689
-You good?
-Yeah.

553
00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:32.392
I'm Nate. Nathaniel.

554
00:21:32.492 --> 00:21:35.928
But you can just call me Nate.
Everybody else calls me that.

555
00:21:36.028 --> 00:21:37.163
Okay!

556
00:21:37.263 --> 00:21:39.599
So. Callie. you wanna see
our robot from last year?

557
00:21:39.699 --> 00:21:41.200
[Callie] Sure.

558
00:21:42.134 --> 00:21:46.105
[whirring. clunking]

559
00:21:48.741 --> 00:21:50.377
Definitely more
heart than function.

560
00:21:50.477 --> 00:21:51.744
Yeah.

561
00:21:51.844 --> 00:21:53.480
But now that we got
the LeBron of robotics.

562
00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:54.914
we goin' all the way.

563
00:21:55.014 --> 00:21:57.617
Yeah. that's. uh...
That's a lot of pressure.

564
00:21:57.717 --> 00:21:59.952
No. just all of our hopes
and dreams on our shoulders.

565
00:22:00.052 --> 00:22:03.155
[clicks tongue]
Light work.

566
00:22:03.255 --> 00:22:06.693
[phone ringing]

567
00:22:06.793 --> 00:22:09.161
Oh. um. I got to take this.
Sorry. guys.

568
00:22:09.261 --> 00:22:10.196
Yeah.

569
00:22:10.296 --> 00:22:11.631
Hey. Dad. What's up?

570
00:22:11.731 --> 00:22:13.533
Kind of busy with
school right now.

571
00:22:13.633 --> 00:22:15.402
[Dad] Well. come home.
We're celebrating!

572
00:22:15.502 --> 00:22:16.969
That's right. your daddy
got moved up to the roster.

573
00:22:17.069 --> 00:22:18.638
No more practice squad!
Ha. ha!

574
00:22:18.738 --> 00:22:21.474
Okay. I'll...
I'll see you soon.

575
00:22:21.574 --> 00:22:23.309
* Hey. feeling good

576
00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:25.678
So Rodney comes at me
from the right. babe. right?

577
00:22:25.778 --> 00:22:28.748
And I'm--I'm like. nope.
[laughs]

578
00:22:29.816 --> 00:22:32.552
So then I juke left.
kind of like this.

579
00:22:32.652 --> 00:22:34.654
Whoo! He don't have
a chance. right?

580
00:22:34.754 --> 00:22:36.055
So then I get it on--

581
00:22:36.155 --> 00:22:38.057
[clanking]

582
00:22:40.059 --> 00:22:43.195
Wait--I mean. you get the idea.

583
00:22:43.295 --> 00:22:44.397
Yes.

584
00:22:44.497 --> 00:22:45.865
You know what?

585
00:22:45.965 --> 00:22:47.434
I think the assistant coach
got some on the video.

586
00:22:47.534 --> 00:22:49.068
-So. I'll be right back.
-Okay.

587
00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:52.539
So. how was robotics?

588
00:22:52.639 --> 00:22:54.907
Everybody seems to be
pretty cool so far.

589
00:22:55.007 --> 00:22:57.644
I mean. that's great!
No offense to your dad. but...

590
00:22:57.744 --> 00:22:59.278
you definitely get
your brains from me.

591
00:22:59.378 --> 00:23:00.480
Okay!

592
00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:03.315
Check it out!
Look at this. huh?

593
00:23:03.416 --> 00:23:05.418
-What!?
-How cool is that?

594
00:23:05.518 --> 00:23:07.286
-50-yard punt return.
-Oh. oh--

595
00:23:07.386 --> 00:23:09.956
Wait. wait. wait. wait.
I gotta fast forward.

596
00:23:10.056 --> 00:23:12.725
-Look at that. huh?
-Oh my gosh!

597
00:23:12.825 --> 00:23:14.927
Dive and catch?

598
00:23:15.562 --> 00:23:16.829
[Both] [grunting]

599
00:23:16.929 --> 00:23:19.398
I'm so proud of you!
[laughs]

600
00:23:19.499 --> 00:23:20.800
[Bobby] Thank you.

601
00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.368
[Callie] I recorded my
game so I can show you how

602
00:23:22.469 --> 00:23:26.539
I'm improving your rating.
but...look at this.

603
00:23:26.639 --> 00:23:30.209
These plays are exactly the same
as what you did in practice.

604
00:23:30.309 --> 00:23:31.678
-Whoa.
-Yeah.

605
00:23:31.778 --> 00:23:33.813
I mean. you know. it was better
in real life. though. because

606
00:23:33.913 --> 00:23:35.882
everything I did. you can
see Anderson Fisher's face.

607
00:23:35.982 --> 00:23:40.587
Every move I make.
he was like. wha?

608
00:23:40.687 --> 00:23:41.754
Jukin' left and right?

609
00:23:41.854 --> 00:23:43.823
Oh. baby girl. I can't sleep.

610
00:23:44.824 --> 00:23:47.460
Maybe the lightning somehow...

611
00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:50.763
No. no. no.

612
00:23:50.863 --> 00:23:53.132
I don't know.
It's just. like...

613
00:23:53.232 --> 00:23:55.234
real you was doing the exact
same thing fake you was doing

614
00:23:55.334 --> 00:23:57.770
at the same time
real you was doing it.

615
00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:59.972
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa!
What are you mumbling about?

616
00:24:00.072 --> 00:24:04.844
I...I don't know.
No. that's insane!

617
00:24:04.944 --> 00:24:08.214
Video games can't
affect real life.

618
00:24:08.314 --> 00:24:10.282
Unless they can.

619
00:24:10.382 --> 00:24:12.051
Then it's like...

620
00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.655
Whoa.

621
00:24:15.755 --> 00:24:17.590
[laughs]

622
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:19.025
I think we need to
run an experiment.

623
00:24:19.125 --> 00:24:20.693
-Say what?
-Your first game.

624
00:24:20.793 --> 00:24:22.629
What if I played
as you in Madden ?

625
00:24:22.729 --> 00:24:24.497
When that lightning hit.
it changed something.

626
00:24:24.597 --> 00:24:25.932
It changed your brain.

627
00:24:26.032 --> 00:24:28.167
No. Dad. let's just
see what happens.

628
00:24:28.267 --> 00:24:29.536
That's crazy.

629
00:24:29.636 --> 00:24:32.171
What's the harm in trying?

630
00:24:32.271 --> 00:24:38.244
[crowd cheering]

631
00:24:39.345 --> 00:24:41.147
* I don't swim. but I
give a long stroke *

632
00:24:41.247 --> 00:24:42.515
* Can I flex

633
00:24:42.615 --> 00:24:44.083
* While you get up in the rest

634
00:24:44.183 --> 00:24:46.018
* Get up in the gets
while I soak up my success *

635
00:24:46.118 --> 00:24:47.219
* Gettin' tokens
for your stress *

636
00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:48.855
* I'll be making
all the checks *

637
00:24:48.955 --> 00:24:50.590
* Any time you see me
step on the stage *

638
00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:52.792
It's the start of a new season

639
00:24:52.892 --> 00:24:56.028
with one sold-out
Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

640
00:24:56.128 --> 00:24:58.898
And Tony. here we go.

641
00:24:58.998 --> 00:25:05.071
[crowd shouting. cheering]

642
00:25:16.015 --> 00:25:18.150
* Caught up in your
feelin's like you froze *

643
00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:20.386
* Everything around
you gettin'-- *

644
00:25:20.486 --> 00:25:22.388
[Tony] Well. on the
opening drive. Jim.

645
00:25:22.488 --> 00:25:25.692
look for the Falcons to
establish the run early today.

646
00:25:25.792 --> 00:25:27.059
especially with Anderson Fisher.

647
00:25:27.159 --> 00:25:29.328
who had a sensational
rookie season last year.

648
00:25:29.428 --> 00:25:31.964
It's a big story at
running back. no doubt. Tony.

649
00:25:32.064 --> 00:25:34.366
Anderson Fisher. the young star.

650
00:25:34.466 --> 00:25:37.069
looking to duplicate
his success from last year.

651
00:25:37.169 --> 00:25:40.272
And Taylor will start
out in the gun. here.

652
00:25:40.372 --> 00:25:41.874
and quickly some
pressure off the edge.

653
00:25:41.974 --> 00:25:43.710
and down he goes!

654
00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:45.211
[Tony] Taylor. oh my gosh!

655
00:25:45.311 --> 00:25:47.914
Well. that's a rough
start right there.

656
00:25:48.014 --> 00:25:49.816
Fisher. that's your assignment.

657
00:25:49.916 --> 00:25:51.584
And. you know.
he's only in the second year.

658
00:25:51.684 --> 00:25:53.953
Mistakes are gonna happen.

659
00:25:54.053 --> 00:25:57.824
[Jim] A mistake by Fisher.
And now it's second down.

660
00:25:59.525 --> 00:26:01.761
Twenty. hut!

661
00:26:01.861 --> 00:26:03.062
[Jim] And they
give it to Fisher.

662
00:26:03.162 --> 00:26:05.698
He finds a hole.
but coughs it up.

663
00:26:05.798 --> 00:26:08.100
And the Falcons recover.
but my goodness.

664
00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.137
what a tough start
for Anderson Fisher.

665
00:26:11.804 --> 00:26:13.139
[Tony] I agree with
Coach Evans here.

666
00:26:13.239 --> 00:26:15.074
To miss pass protection
on the first play

667
00:26:15.174 --> 00:26:16.843
and then fumble on the second?

668
00:26:16.943 --> 00:26:18.945
Here we go with the
veteran Bobby Coleman.

669
00:26:19.045 --> 00:26:20.713
[Jim] A bold move.
no doubt. Ton.

670
00:26:20.813 --> 00:26:22.281
A surprising move.

671
00:26:22.381 --> 00:26:25.818
So from the young buck to
the veteran. Coleman here.

672
00:26:25.918 --> 00:26:28.688
Third down for the Falcons.

673
00:26:29.388 --> 00:26:31.057
Bobby! Bobby.
you're on the wrong side!

674
00:26:31.157 --> 00:26:34.193
[Tony] Bobby's gotta
move over. Jim.

675
00:26:34.293 --> 00:26:35.928
Yeah. there ya go. Bobby.

676
00:26:37.463 --> 00:26:39.331
Ready in motion. motion!

677
00:26:40.332 --> 00:26:43.903
[Jim] And Taylor. he's gonna
go up top on third and long.

678
00:26:44.003 --> 00:26:45.071
He's looking.

679
00:26:45.171 --> 00:26:47.273
He has nobody down field open.

680
00:26:47.373 --> 00:26:49.541
He's gonna check
this down to Coleman.

681
00:26:49.642 --> 00:26:55.581
[music]

682
00:26:55.682 --> 00:26:57.283
[crowd cheering]

683
00:26:57.383 --> 00:27:00.286
[Jim] Coleman with a
nice little sidestep.

684
00:27:00.386 --> 00:27:03.589
I mean. look at the spin
move by Bobby Coleman.

685
00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:06.558
[Tony] Bobby Coleman
is making some moves--

686
00:27:06.659 --> 00:27:09.195
Ah! Oh. excuse me.
[laughs]

687
00:27:09.295 --> 00:27:10.663
[Tony] --college.
he was the guy.

688
00:27:10.763 --> 00:27:12.564
How happy is he right now. Jim?

689
00:27:12.665 --> 00:27:14.433
You gotta look at that.

690
00:27:14.533 --> 00:27:17.603
Bobby Coleman showing off
that Heisman Trophy.

691
00:27:17.704 --> 00:27:21.173
He's got great in...stincts.

692
00:27:21.273 --> 00:27:22.408
Instincts weren't great

693
00:27:22.508 --> 00:27:23.943
when you put a wall
in front of him.

694
00:27:24.043 --> 00:27:25.544
[Jim] Runs into the wall!

695
00:27:25.644 --> 00:27:26.713
No way!

696
00:27:26.813 --> 00:27:28.614
[Jim] He was so amped up.

697
00:27:28.715 --> 00:27:30.316
I was right!

698
00:27:30.416 --> 00:27:31.751
[Tony] This is
really impressive.

699
00:27:31.851 --> 00:27:33.085
I can't believe it worked.

700
00:27:33.185 --> 00:27:34.887
[Jim] Six to nothing. Atlanta.

701
00:27:34.987 --> 00:27:37.824
Bobby Coleman. his glory
days being reclaimed

702
00:27:37.924 --> 00:27:39.525
for a moment. here.

703
00:27:39.625 --> 00:27:41.060
Yeah!

704
00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:44.030
[Jim] He's been the
story so far today. Tony.

705
00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:46.198
He's going to reverse course.

706
00:27:47.199 --> 00:27:49.435
What is happening here?

707
00:27:51.137 --> 00:27:54.573
[Tony] If I'm
Anderson Fisher. I'm worried...

708
00:27:54.673 --> 00:27:57.710
[Jim] Another sidestep.
and there he goes!

709
00:27:57.810 --> 00:27:59.111
One more time. folks!

710
00:27:59.211 --> 00:28:02.481
Bobby Coleman. fourth
touchdown of the day.

711
00:28:03.415 --> 00:28:06.185
[crowd cheering]

712
00:28:06.285 --> 00:28:10.156
[Jim] Even blowing a kiss to
his wife. Keisha. in the crowd.

713
00:28:10.256 --> 00:28:12.124
The shovel pass. and guess who?

714
00:28:12.224 --> 00:28:13.860
Bobby Coleman one more time.

715
00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:16.528
And the Panthers'
defense is playing well.

716
00:28:16.628 --> 00:28:19.999
But Bobby and the Falcons
are playing better.

717
00:28:20.099 --> 00:28:23.302
It's off the charts!

718
00:28:23.402 --> 00:28:25.171
This time. Coleman
splits out wide.

719
00:28:25.271 --> 00:28:26.505
They throw it to him.

720
00:28:26.605 --> 00:28:28.474
He's got three
Panthers ahead of him.

721
00:28:28.574 --> 00:28:29.608
What's he doing?

722
00:28:29.708 --> 00:28:30.709
[Tony] He's going backwards.

723
00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:32.178
No! What are you doing?

724
00:28:32.278 --> 00:28:33.880
[Jim] Oh. look at
what he's doing.

725
00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:36.515
What a move!

726
00:28:36.615 --> 00:28:39.185
[Tony] He went backwards
to go forwards.

727
00:28:39.285 --> 00:28:41.320
Bobby Coleman is
having quite the day.

728
00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:44.190
[Jim] And with
touchdown number six.

729
00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:48.995
tied with Gale Sayers for
the most touchdowns ever scored

730
00:28:49.095 --> 00:28:50.396
in a single game.

731
00:28:50.496 --> 00:28:52.064
I don't even know
what else to say.

732
00:28:52.164 --> 00:28:53.699
[Tony] I can't say anything
about his performance.

733
00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.167
He scored six touchdowns...

734
00:28:55.267 --> 00:28:58.070
You were right. but...
This wasn't part of the plan.

735
00:28:59.705 --> 00:29:01.007
[Jim] Look at this.

736
00:29:01.107 --> 00:29:03.542
He's breaking it down
in all sorts of ways.

737
00:29:03.642 --> 00:29:05.744
[Tony] But this is
definitely gonna get a flag.

738
00:29:05.845 --> 00:29:09.148
[Jim] And that's gonna be a
15-yard penalty for taunting.

739
00:29:09.248 --> 00:29:11.450
But after all that
he's done in this game.

740
00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:13.986
I think the fans are gonna
give him a pass on this one.

741
00:29:14.086 --> 00:29:15.521
Hey. he's ahead of the game.

742
00:29:15.621 --> 00:29:17.990
[Jim] Joining him. his
wife's got it down too.

743
00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:20.827
[Tony] His family has
to be on cloud nine.

744
00:29:20.927 --> 00:29:22.228
It's inspirational. Jim.

745
00:29:22.328 --> 00:29:23.963
I mean. truly. this guy was on

746
00:29:24.063 --> 00:29:25.832
the practice squad
three days ago.

747
00:29:25.932 --> 00:29:27.566
Whoo!

748
00:29:27.666 --> 00:29:30.036

You play like that. we gonna
win a lot of football games.

757
00:29:54.626 --> 00:29:56.695
[cheers and applause]

758
00:29:56.795 --> 00:29:59.398
Execution. determination.

-in dirty bird football.
-[laughter]

760
00:30:01.167 --> 00:30:02.568
Let me see that game ball.

761
00:30:02.668 --> 00:30:05.037
Speaking of that. today.

762
00:30:05.137 --> 00:30:08.107
a certain someone showed
he still got some wheels.

763
00:30:08.207 --> 00:30:09.341
[cheering]

764
00:30:09.441 --> 00:30:11.043
[Coach Evans]
And. and. and. and!

765
00:30:11.143 --> 00:30:12.511
Some questionable dance moves.

766
00:30:12.611 --> 00:30:13.980
[laughter]

767
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.215
You know who I'm talking about.
Bobby Coleman. hell of a job!

768

[cheers and applause]

769

[Callie and Keisha]
[laughter]

774
00:30:41.707 --> 00:30:43.375
Those six touchdowns
gave me life.

775
00:30:43.475 --> 00:30:44.911
-Six!
-[Callie] Six!

776
00:30:45.011 --> 00:30:46.412
I still can't believe it!

777
00:30:46.512 --> 00:30:47.947
Oh. well you gotta
believe it. baby.

778
00:30:48.047 --> 00:30:50.249
See. 'cause Bobby Coleman is
turning back the clock. baby.

779
00:30:50.349 --> 00:30:53.019
-Hey!
-That's right. that's right.

780
00:30:53.119 --> 00:30:55.354
It just felt like. um...

781
00:30:55.454 --> 00:30:58.357
Like you were possessed
out there or something.

782
00:30:58.457 --> 00:31:00.426
-It kind of felt like that.
-[Callie] Yeah!

783
00:31:00.526 --> 00:31:01.627
It did.

784
00:31:01.727 --> 00:31:03.095
Just a vessel of some...

785
00:31:03.195 --> 00:31:06.232
greater power acting
through you.

786
00:31:06.332 --> 00:31:08.167
[Keisha] Oh. oh. oh. okay!

787
00:31:08.267 --> 00:31:09.768
[Callie] You might get
the life you always wanted.

788
00:31:09.868 --> 00:31:11.137
-Yeah!
-Yes!

789
00:31:11.237 --> 00:31:12.771
-Amen!
-Amen!

00:31:12.871 --> 00:31:15.807
-Amen!
-[Bobby] Amen!

00:31:23.382 --> 00:31:25.451
* You think you
can play me *

795
00:31:25.551 --> 00:31:28.854
* You ain't gotta come for me

796
00:31:29.922 --> 00:31:31.657
Okay. hold on. hold on.

797
00:31:31.757 --> 00:31:35.161

798
00:31:35.261 --> 00:31:37.263

[birds chirping]

801
00:31:45.437 --> 00:31:47.273
Okay. so in honor of
our brand-new season.

802
00:31:47.373 --> 00:31:50.809
I have a little
surprise for everyone.

803
00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:53.245
Homemade robot iPhone cases!

804
00:31:53.345 --> 00:31:56.848
And these originally
designed T-shirts.

805
00:31:56.949 --> 00:32:00.252
Each phone case has a robot
that matches your T-shirts.

806
00:32:00.352 --> 00:32:02.989
You know. to your
individual personalities.

807
00:32:03.089 --> 00:32:05.557
Go. PossumBots.
Aren't they perfect?

808
00:32:05.657 --> 00:32:09.128
I mean. it's a little
much. but I'll take it.

809
00:32:09.228 --> 00:32:10.462
That's what I like to hear.

810
00:32:10.562 --> 00:32:13.599
Yeah. I appreciate this.
This is--this is dope.

811
00:32:13.699 --> 00:32:15.201
But y'all. I got the
video all set up.

812
00:32:15.301 --> 00:32:16.702
Y'all ready to see what
we doin' this year?

813
00:32:16.802 --> 00:32:18.537
-Ooh. yes!
-Yeah.

814
00:32:19.605 --> 00:32:23.175
[Woman on video] Welcome to the
2022 First Robotics Competition.

815
00:32:23.275 --> 00:32:26.778
And this year's game?
Toxic Takedown.

816
00:32:26.878 --> 00:32:30.049
The Earth has been
overwhelmed by toxic waste.

817
00:32:30.149 --> 00:32:31.750
Using your removal droids.

818
00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:34.220
you'll collect
condensed toxic waste

819
00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:37.056
and launch it into
one of four depositories.

820
00:32:37.156 --> 00:32:39.191
The planet is counting on you!

821
00:32:39.291 --> 00:32:40.626
All right. guys.

822
00:32:40.726 --> 00:32:43.395
We should probably start
working on this right now.

823
00:32:43.495 --> 00:32:49.501
Or...we could procrastinate.

824
00:32:50.236 --> 00:32:51.703
* Let's go

825
00:32:51.803 --> 00:32:54.473
[cheering]

826
00:32:55.674 --> 00:32:57.576
* Put your hands up in the sky

827
00:32:57.676 --> 00:33:00.246
* Just keeping the dream alive

[tires screeching]

831
00:33:12.058 --> 00:33:13.492
Oh!

832
00:33:15.727 --> 00:33:17.496
Whoa!

833
00:33:19.798 --> 00:33:20.999
Yo! You good?

834
00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:22.168
Whoa...

835
00:33:22.268 --> 00:33:23.369
That was wild.

836
00:33:23.469 --> 00:33:25.671
Yeah. I just got a
little distracted.

837
00:33:25.771 --> 00:33:27.073
Was it my face?

838
00:33:27.173 --> 00:33:29.208
Look. I keep meaning to tell
you not to be so distracted.

839
00:33:29.308 --> 00:33:31.009
Can you get over
yourself and help me out?

840
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:32.544
All right. I got you.

841
00:33:33.579 --> 00:33:35.514
[Callie] I did not expect
these tacos to be so good.

842
00:33:35.614 --> 00:33:37.083
[Nate] Right? I've been here
for almost four years

843
00:33:37.183 --> 00:33:38.317
and I'm still not sick of them.

844
00:33:38.417 --> 00:33:40.786
My dad's in the military.
so we move around a lot.

845
00:33:40.886 --> 00:33:43.222
But good food always helps.
Mm-hmm.

846
00:33:43.322 --> 00:33:45.424
Four years is impressive.

847
00:33:45.524 --> 00:33:47.893
Yeah. the longest I ever
lived somewhere was three.

848
00:33:47.993 --> 00:33:49.128
But that was Jacksonville.

849
00:33:49.228 --> 00:33:53.732
so I was kind of happy my
dad got traded. so. yeah.

850
00:33:53.832 --> 00:33:58.237
But. um. hey. thanks for making
me feel like a part of the team.

851
00:33:58.337 --> 00:33:59.305
Hey. you're a great addition.

852
00:33:59.405 --> 00:34:02.074
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

853
00:34:02.174 --> 00:34:06.912
You know. my family has
always revolved around my dad.

854
00:34:07.012 --> 00:34:08.980
I mean. it's fine. but I
just never really experienced

855
00:34:09.081 --> 00:34:11.950
anything outside of that.

856
00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:14.386
So it just feels good to
be Callie Coleman for once

857
00:34:14.486 --> 00:34:16.322
and not just Bobby
Coleman's daughter.

858
00:34:16.422 --> 00:34:18.724
-You know what? I feel that.
-Yeah.

hands off to Coleman.

860
00:34:23.729 --> 00:34:26.732
And look at him zig-zagging
through the snow!

861
00:34:26.832 --> 00:34:30.169
[Tony] Is it me.
or is Bobby Coleman

862
00:34:30.269 --> 00:34:33.805
making yet another
unbelievable play?

863
00:34:33.905 --> 00:34:37.376
It's. uh. not perfect.

864
00:34:37.476 --> 00:34:39.345
But what are we thinking?

865
00:34:39.445 --> 00:34:42.114
That you're a genius! What?

866
00:34:42.214 --> 00:34:44.650
The structure is crazy!
We can do so much with that.

867
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:46.718
Ooh. ooh. we can throw
the circuits in the back.

868
00:34:46.818 --> 00:34:49.521
And if we rotate
that arm. great launch.

869
00:34:49.621 --> 00:34:51.990
It's already. like. perfect.

870
00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:54.326
Guys...gold stickers!

871
00:34:54.426 --> 00:34:55.461
[laughter]

872
00:34:55.561 --> 00:34:56.828
Yes. Zoe. yeah.

873
00:34:56.928 --> 00:35:00.332
[Jim] Falcons on
the 2-yard line.

874
00:35:00.432 --> 00:35:02.834
And it's handed to Coleman.

875
00:35:02.934 --> 00:35:07.606
Oh! He flips over the top
like we've never seen before!

876
00:35:07.706 --> 00:35:08.840
Yeah!

877
00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.642
[Tony] I don't know
what radioactive spider

878
00:35:10.742 --> 00:35:12.511
bit Bobby Coleman. but this
is the fifth game in a row...

879
00:35:12.611 --> 00:35:14.913
Yes! My baby can fly.

880
00:35:15.013 --> 00:35:17.249
[yells]

881
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:20.152
We got a good thing
going or what. huh?

882
00:35:20.252 --> 00:35:22.254
[laughs]

883
00:35:22.354 --> 00:35:24.490
* Watch the fam eat.
never starve *

884
00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:26.024
[Jim] Coleman.
just one hand.

885
00:35:26.124 --> 00:35:28.227
and he stops Garner.

886
00:35:28.327 --> 00:35:29.728
[whistle]

887
00:35:29.828 --> 00:35:31.363
Yeah! Whoo!

888
00:35:31.463 --> 00:35:33.965
[Jim] He's gonna bust
out the dance moves.

889
00:35:34.065 --> 00:35:35.801
[Tony] You can stay up
here if you want to. Jim.

890
00:35:35.901 --> 00:35:38.170
but I'm going to the
field to dance with

891
00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:39.805
Bobby Coleman and the Falcons.

892
00:35:39.905 --> 00:35:42.441
-Peri. head of PR.
-Nice to meet you. Peri.

893
00:35:42.541 --> 00:35:43.942
That was quite a game.

894
00:35:44.042 --> 00:35:46.545
I have never heard the
press room buzzing like this.

895
00:35:46.645 --> 00:35:47.946
-Buzzing for me?
-Mm-hmm.

896
00:35:48.046 --> 00:35:50.549
Hi. can I get
a chamomile tea. please?

897
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:53.352
You're Bobby Coleman's wife.
right?

898
00:35:53.452 --> 00:35:55.621
-Yes.
-Girl. okay.

899
00:35:55.721 --> 00:35:58.524
It is on the house
for the whole season.

900
00:35:58.624 --> 00:36:03.028
-Are you serious?
-Yeah!

901
00:36:03.128 --> 00:36:05.931
Okay. okay!

902
00:36:06.031 --> 00:36:07.633
* Gotta elevate

903
00:36:07.733 --> 00:36:09.801
* No more looking back
'cause I stay in the game *

904
00:36:09.901 --> 00:36:12.938
* On to the next.
I don't see no contest *

905
00:36:13.038 --> 00:36:14.072
[cheering]

906
00:36:14.172 --> 00:36:16.475
Last bit of business.
What do we call it?

907
00:36:16.575 --> 00:36:19.511
SpongeBot SpareParts.

908
00:36:19.611 --> 00:36:20.646
-That was dope.
-I like that.

909
00:36:20.746 --> 00:36:22.314
-Yeah?
-Let's do it!

910
00:36:22.414 --> 00:36:25.050
* No more looking back
'cause I stay in the game *

911
00:36:28.053 --> 00:36:29.755
I got big news! Big news!

912
00:36:29.855 --> 00:36:31.357
Coach just told me
I'm starting next game.

913
00:36:31.457 --> 00:36:33.792
Not Anderson. me.

914
00:36:33.892 --> 00:36:35.727
It's been 10 years
since I've started.

915
00:36:35.827 --> 00:36:38.497
Mm! A small knock
might've been nice.

916
00:36:38.597 --> 00:36:43.502
Hey. it's all happening!
It's all happening. [laughs]

917
00:36:43.602 --> 00:36:45.304
And--and this game is
the most important so far.

918
00:36:45.404 --> 00:36:48.940
so I need you to make sure I'm
at my absolute best this Sunday.

919
00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:51.910
-Wait. this--this Sunday?
-[laughs]

920
00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:54.380
Wait. you got somewhere
more important to be?

921
00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.948
Yeah. the robotics regionals.

922
00:36:57.048 --> 00:36:58.817
Can't you just scoot
away. you know.

923
00:36:58.917 --> 00:37:03.322
when you're not doing your thing
so you can do our thing. huh?

924
00:37:03.422 --> 00:37:05.691
The thing that's got me
starting

925
00:37:05.791 --> 00:37:09.561
over Anderson Fisher.

926
00:37:09.661 --> 00:37:11.930
[Callie] Maybe.

927
00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:17.135
Callie. I-I need you.
Your dad needs you.

928
00:37:17.235 --> 00:37:18.970
-I need you.
-[chuckles]

929
00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:20.972
[text whoosh]

930
00:37:21.072 --> 00:37:22.574
Yeah. Of course.

931
00:37:22.674 --> 00:37:25.176
I'm--I'm sure I can manage.

932
00:37:25.277 --> 00:37:27.245
-That's my girl.
-Mm-hmm.

933
00:37:27.346 --> 00:37:30.048
[laughs] Yes!

934
00:37:32.551 --> 00:37:34.119
[laughs gleefully]

935
00:37:34.219 --> 00:37:35.887
[door shuts]

936
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:40.326
[sighs]

937
00:37:40.426 --> 00:37:41.760
[Woman on PA] Ladies
and gentlemen.

938
00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:44.563
welcome to First Robotics
Regional Competition.

939
00:37:44.663 --> 00:37:46.565
You will begin in five minutes.

940
00:37:46.665 --> 00:37:49.535
Teams. prepare your robots.

941
00:37:53.672 --> 00:37:58.544
[music playing from gym]

942
00:38:18.964 --> 00:38:20.499
[Male announcer] CBS Sports.

943
00:38:20.599 --> 00:38:23.034
[Madden] EA Sports--
Get in the game.

944
00:38:23.134 --> 00:38:24.803
[indistinct chatter]

945
00:38:24.903 --> 00:38:26.838
Sorry.
Just doing a little recon.

946
00:38:26.938 --> 00:38:28.474
-Yes!
-[Woman] Dellview!

947
00:38:28.574 --> 00:38:30.542
You guys are up!

948
00:38:30.642 --> 00:38:32.177
-[Both] Paws up!
-[Margo] Let's do this!

949
00:38:32.277 --> 00:38:33.712
[Woman] Go!

950
00:38:33.812 --> 00:38:35.614
* All I do is win. win.
win. no matter what *

951
00:38:35.714 --> 00:38:39.150
* Got money on my mind.
I can never get enough *

952
00:38:40.586 --> 00:38:41.687
There you go.

953
00:38:41.787 --> 00:38:44.155
* Everybody hands go up

954
00:38:45.223 --> 00:38:46.992
[Man] You know what they
say about great players.

955
00:38:47.092 --> 00:38:51.563
The more personal you are.
the more valuable you are.

956
00:38:51.663 --> 00:38:54.099
[Jim] And he's all
alone down the sideline.

957
00:38:54.199 --> 00:38:58.937
And he leaps in for good
measure for the touchdown!

958
00:38:59.037 --> 00:39:02.273
[whirring]

959
00:39:03.274 --> 00:39:05.944
[cheering]

960
00:39:06.712 --> 00:39:08.747
[Tony] And Coleman
comes back just in time

961
00:39:08.847 --> 00:39:10.816
to make an incredibly
difficult play.

962
00:39:10.916 --> 00:39:12.951
[Jim] This is quite
the balancing act.

963
00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:16.187
Whoo!

964
00:39:16.287 --> 00:39:21.359
[music]

965
00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.228
Stop!

966
00:39:23.328 --> 00:39:24.896
Someone just threw up

967
00:39:24.996 --> 00:39:27.966
all the way at the other
end of the building.

968
00:39:28.066 --> 00:39:31.269
and it's just so.
so far from here.

969
00:39:31.369 --> 00:39:32.771
Worst than bingo night.

970
00:39:32.871 --> 00:39:35.106
* All I do is win. win.
win. no matter what *

971
00:39:35.206 --> 00:39:37.843
[Jim] And now Coleman.
it's like he's frozen in time.

972
00:39:37.943 --> 00:39:39.878
[Tony] Multitasking
is important.

973
00:39:39.978 --> 00:39:41.680
Trying to figure out
exactly which way to go?

974
00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:43.048
Also important.

975
00:39:43.148 --> 00:39:45.016
[Jim] Look at that.
Focus regained.

976
00:39:45.116 --> 00:39:47.419
And now he just heads
straight to the sideline.

977
00:39:47.519 --> 00:39:49.421
Crisis narrowly averted.

978
00:39:49.521 --> 00:39:51.356
[Tony] Despite defenders
coming from every direction.

979
00:39:51.457 --> 00:39:56.094
Coleman bobs and weaves.
somehow finding a clear path.

980
00:39:57.128 --> 00:39:59.998
-Hey.
-Were you just in the closet?

981
00:40:00.098 --> 00:40:02.734
No. No. no.

982
00:40:04.603 --> 00:40:06.438
What's going on?

983
00:40:08.373 --> 00:40:09.374
Is something wrong?

984
00:40:09.475 --> 00:40:12.911
'Cause you know you can tell me.

985
00:40:16.782 --> 00:40:19.050
I'm good.

986
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:20.185
Mom. I'm fine.

987
00:40:20.285 --> 00:40:23.722
I'm just a little
stressed with the. um...

988
00:40:23.822 --> 00:40:25.190
the robot stuff.

989
00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:27.559
It's crazy in there.
But I gotta get back in there.

990
00:40:27.659 --> 00:40:29.260
See you in there.

991
00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:34.800
[music]

992
00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:37.402
No. no. no!
Can't control it!

993
00:40:37.503 --> 00:40:39.270
What should we do?

994
00:40:41.439 --> 00:40:43.241
Oh my gosh!

995
00:40:44.442 --> 00:40:45.611
Callie. watch out!

996
00:40:45.711 --> 00:40:47.278
[Margo] Oh my god.

997
00:40:47.378 --> 00:40:48.747
Callie!

998
00:40:51.717 --> 00:40:53.485
What is she doing?

999
00:40:55.821 --> 00:40:58.490
* All I do is win. win.
win. no matter what *

1000
00:40:58.590 --> 00:41:01.760
* Got money on my mind.
I can never get enough *

1001
00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:03.962
* And every time I step
up in the building *

1002
00:41:04.062 --> 00:41:06.297
* Everybody hands go up

1003
00:41:06.397 --> 00:41:07.866
-Yes!
-My god!

1004
00:41:07.966 --> 00:41:10.936
* And they stay there
And they stay there *

1005
00:41:11.036 --> 00:41:12.904
* And they stay there

1006
00:41:14.439 --> 00:41:15.440
[buzzer]

1007
00:41:15.541 --> 00:41:19.144
[cheering]

1008
00:41:19.244 --> 00:41:21.813
* Put your hands in the air.
make 'em stay there *

1009
00:41:21.913 --> 00:41:23.081
Anderson. how does it feel

1010
00:41:23.181 --> 00:41:24.716
knowing your teammate's
on track to break

1011
00:41:24.816 --> 00:41:26.585
your single-season
rushing record?

1012
00:41:26.685 --> 00:41:30.121
I mean. gotta be
some mixed emotions.

1013
00:41:31.222 --> 00:41:33.792
Whatever gets the
team a win. right?

1014
00:41:33.892 --> 00:41:35.927
But. uh. I would like to
know how he's doing it.

1015
00:41:36.027 --> 00:41:37.629
Anybody wanna know?

1016
00:41:37.729 --> 00:41:39.364
Hey. maybe it's a. I
don't know. a ripple

1017
00:41:39.464 --> 00:41:41.066
in time-space continuum.

1018
00:41:41.166 --> 00:41:42.634
[laughter]

1019
00:41:42.734 --> 00:41:43.702
Comedian!

1020
00:41:43.802 --> 00:41:45.436
No. but seriously. though.

1021
00:41:45.537 --> 00:41:47.939
How are you doing it. my boy?

1022
00:41:48.039 --> 00:41:50.876
[Woman] Come on. Bobby.
what's your secret?

1023
00:41:50.976 --> 00:41:53.111
I'd have to say. honestly.
the support of my family.

1024
00:41:53.211 --> 00:41:54.846
Those two ladies right
there in the back?

1025
00:41:54.946 --> 00:41:56.147
They just started
supporting you. huh?

1026
00:41:56.247 --> 00:41:57.415
Yeah. Huh?

1027
00:41:57.515 --> 00:41:59.651
How are you guys feeling
about Bobby's season so far?

1028
00:41:59.751 --> 00:42:03.488
Oh. we are just so
very proud of him.

1029
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:05.557
-Right. Callie.
-Yeah.

1030
00:42:05.657 --> 00:42:07.025
Yeah. I mean. totally.

1031
00:42:07.125 --> 00:42:10.495
I mean. we're sort of like
our own team. you know?

1032
00:42:10.596 --> 00:42:13.999
We feel like we're a very

get a warm-up game in

before we dive into
the schematics.

1185

And if I lose--if I lose--
we play some games.

two games. then.

You know what?

1201
00:49:30.935 --> 00:49:34.372
I could really use one of those
high-performance smoothies.

1202

Right now.

1204
00:49:38.943 --> 00:49:40.745
Okay. um. wait. remind me.

1205
00:49:40.845 --> 00:49:44.015
In football. more points
are better. right?

1206
00:49:44.115 --> 00:49:45.516
You know. let's go through the
tutorial real quick.

1207
00:49:45.616 --> 00:49:46.984
Like. really teach
you how to play.

1208
00:49:47.085 --> 00:49:48.219
Oh. you a savage. huh?

1209
00:49:48.319 --> 00:49:49.520
You know I let you
win this one. right?

1210
00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:51.022
-Oh. for real?
-I had to.

1211
00:49:51.122 --> 00:49:52.390
You can't--okay.
Whatever.

1212
00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:53.724
How come you don't
play as your dad?

1213
00:49:53.824 --> 00:49:55.026
He's hot right now.

1214
00:49:55.126 --> 00:49:56.594
It's like he's having
a second coming or something.

1215
00:49:56.694 --> 00:49:58.796
Well. I only play him
for actual games.

1216
00:49:58.896 --> 00:50:01.632
-What?
-[gulps]

1217
00:50:01.732 --> 00:50:03.368
Um...

1218
00:50:03.468 --> 00:50:04.802
[laughs nervously]

1219
00:50:04.902 --> 00:50:08.606
Um. well. what I mean is
when I'm not there with him.

1220
00:50:08.706 --> 00:50:10.941
like with my family. I. um...

1221
00:50:11.042 --> 00:50:15.080
I play him in Madden to
make it feel like I'm there.

1222
00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:16.747
Yeah. yeah. like. um...

1223
00:50:16.847 --> 00:50:19.250
We call it
virtual bonding. so. yeah.

1224
00:50:19.350 --> 00:50:21.419
How about I just
grab us some sodas?

1225
00:50:21.519 --> 00:50:22.987
That seems accurate. yeah.
I will be right back.

1226
00:50:23.088 --> 00:50:25.856
I'm not--I'm not...thirsty.

1227
00:50:28.093 --> 00:50:29.327
Okay.

1228
00:50:34.732 --> 00:50:36.033
Ah. okay.

1229
00:50:36.134 --> 00:50:37.435
Really need your
blueberries. right?

1230
00:50:37.535 --> 00:50:39.237
Need your antioxidants.

1231
00:50:39.337 --> 00:50:40.705
Then you get your strawberries.

1232
00:50:40.805 --> 00:50:43.841
Get it all in there.
Yep. everything. that's it.

1233
00:50:43.941 --> 00:50:46.010
Yeah. right there.

1234
00:50:46.111 --> 00:50:47.445
Banana in.

1235
00:50:49.314 --> 00:50:50.781
Whole thing.
With the peel on.

1236
00:50:50.881 --> 00:50:51.782
With the peel?

1237
00:50:51.882 --> 00:50:53.184
A little oatmeal
never hurt anybody.

1238
00:50:53.284 --> 00:50:54.885
Two scoops.

1239
00:50:55.386 --> 00:50:56.854
Or more.

1240
00:50:59.290 --> 00:51:01.359
Aah!

1241
00:51:01.459 --> 00:51:04.395
Yo! Fallen
and you can't get up?

1242
00:51:04.495 --> 00:51:07.832
I just fumbled the spoon.
I'm old. G.

1243
00:51:07.932 --> 00:51:15.640
[music]

1244
00:51:20.145 --> 00:51:21.179
[laughs]

1245
00:51:21.279 --> 00:51:22.680
Yes. yes.

1246
00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:26.717
The key is. uh.
the milk. right?

1247
00:51:26.817 --> 00:51:27.685
You know?

1248
00:51:27.785 --> 00:51:30.888
But never from a cow.
[laughs]

1249
00:51:30.988 --> 00:51:33.691
Only oat or goat--
it won't make you bloat.

1250
00:51:36.794 --> 00:51:39.930
I gotta say. man. sound like
a normal old smoothie to me.

1251
00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:42.567
I don't like the hair.
so let's put a fro on him.

1252
00:51:46.371 --> 00:51:47.738
[Anderson] Yo. I'm
gonna be your age

1253
00:51:47.838 --> 00:51:49.674
by the time you're finished
making this smoothie. man.

1254
00:51:53.878 --> 00:51:55.213
Yo! Can I help?

1255
00:51:55.313 --> 00:51:57.282
[Bobby] I'm good.
I'm all good.

1256
00:51:57.382 --> 00:52:06.424
[music]

1257
00:52:10.261 --> 00:52:11.729
[Nate] [laughs] Yeah.

1258
00:52:15.566 --> 00:52:17.568
Put some blond hair on him.

1259
00:52:18.769 --> 00:52:20.605
[groans]

1260
00:52:24.041 --> 00:52:25.142
[gasps]

1261
00:52:25.243 --> 00:52:26.277
[Anderson] Yo. can I help?

1262
00:52:26.377 --> 00:52:28.346
[Bobby] No. just
keep shooting pool.

1263
00:52:28.446 --> 00:52:30.281
Don't move at all.

1264
00:52:30.381 --> 00:52:35.453
[music]

1265
00:52:35.553 --> 00:52:39.624
The real secret is
all about the fertilizer.

1266
00:52:39.724 --> 00:52:42.960
You gotta fertilize yourself.

1267
00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:44.629
Nasty.

1268
00:52:44.729 --> 00:52:47.932
All right. now we'll add
some junk to that trunk.

1269
00:52:48.032 --> 00:52:50.000
[screams]

1270
00:52:51.035 --> 00:52:52.537
I'm coming back there.

1271
00:52:52.637 --> 00:52:55.240
Why? Why? [sobs]

1272
00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:56.541
That's how he should look.

1273
00:52:56.641 --> 00:52:58.776
That's exactly how
he should look.

1274
00:52:58.876 --> 00:53:01.779
What are you doing?
That's my dad!

1275
00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:04.482
Whoa. relax.

1276
00:53:04.582 --> 00:53:05.850
You know. I thought
it was funny.

1277
00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:07.618
Well. it's not!

1278
00:53:11.489 --> 00:53:13.090
I got my butt back!

1279
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:15.192
What?

1280
00:53:15.293 --> 00:53:16.827
Oh. it's a Gen-Z thing.

1281
00:53:16.927 --> 00:53:18.563
It's kind of like.
you know. I figured it out.

1282
00:53:18.663 --> 00:53:20.365
I got my butt back!
[laughs]

1283
00:53:20.465 --> 00:53:21.399
[Callie] What did you do?

1284
00:53:21.499 --> 00:53:23.000
What else did you change?

1285
00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:26.637
Look. you know what?
I think I'll just head out.

1286
00:53:26.737 --> 00:53:29.139
I didn't you'd get so upset
over a little video game.

1287
00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:31.876
Wait. Nate. Nate. look. Um...

1288
00:53:31.976 --> 00:53:37.047
Okay. so you may not know.
but the game.

1289
00:53:37.147 --> 00:53:38.616
it's. um. uh...

1290
00:53:38.716 --> 00:53:41.151
It's...
It's. um...

1291
00:53:41.252 --> 00:53:42.687
-Well. I...
-You know what?

1292
00:53:42.787 --> 00:53:44.789
I'll just see you at school.

1293
00:53:47.325 --> 00:53:49.560
[sighs]

1294
00:53:52.697 --> 00:53:54.765
That's great.

1295
00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:59.304
[phone ringing. vibrating]

1296
00:53:59.404 --> 00:54:00.738
It's the hospital.
I gotta take this.

1297
00:54:00.838 --> 00:54:03.608
But don't move.
I made brownies to eat.

1298
00:54:05.075 --> 00:54:06.777
Hey. what's up?

1299
00:54:08.479 --> 00:54:09.547
Wanna tell me what
happened to me today?

1300
00:54:09.647 --> 00:54:11.248
It was my friend.

1301
00:54:11.349 --> 00:54:13.318
I shouldn't have left him
alone with the game. all right?

1302
00:54:13.418 --> 00:54:15.786
All right. look. Anderson was
real suspicious of me today.

1303
00:54:15.886 --> 00:54:16.987
Okay? He could ruin
everything for me.

1304
00:54:17.087 --> 00:54:19.690
You can't be so careless.
You know?

1305
00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:21.526
Especially not when I'm about
to beat his rushing record

1306
00:54:21.626 --> 00:54:22.927
and we're about to
make the playoffs.

1307
00:54:23.027 --> 00:54:24.895
I know. I know.

1308
00:54:27.064 --> 00:54:29.133
All right.

1309
00:54:29.967 --> 00:54:31.669
But also. I was thinking...

1310
00:54:32.770 --> 00:54:36.073
Maybe we should chill on
the whole Madden thing.

1311
00:54:36.173 --> 00:54:37.542
What do you mean the
whole Madden thing?

1312
00:54:37.642 --> 00:54:38.643
What are you talking about?

1313
00:54:38.743 --> 00:54:39.944
I just think it's
too much right now.

1314
00:54:40.044 --> 00:54:41.646
And with nationals
and everything. I...

1315
00:54:41.746 --> 00:54:44.214
I think I need to
focus on robotics.

1316
00:54:44.315 --> 00:54:48.252
Callie. robotics?
I got a shot at the Super Bowl.

1317
00:54:48.353 --> 00:54:52.156
You know what that means?
That means a bigger house.

1318
00:54:52.256 --> 00:54:53.691
A nice pool. A shed.

1319
00:54:53.791 --> 00:54:55.159
We can build a
whole shed for you to do

1320
00:54:55.259 --> 00:54:58.463
all the robot building
you could ever wanna do.

1321
00:54:58.563 --> 00:55:00.631
It's great news for all of us.

1322
00:55:00.731 --> 00:55:05.169
Hey. check it out. Look.

1323
00:55:05.269 --> 00:55:06.837
Your dad's on TV again!

1324
00:55:06.937 --> 00:55:09.340
Everybody keeps asking
me what my secret is.

1325
00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:10.808
There's no secret. [laughs]

1326
00:55:10.908 --> 00:55:13.210
What's up. big man?
That's it! Hard work!

1327
00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:14.412
My hard work!

1328
00:55:14.512 --> 00:55:16.013
That's all there is to it!

1329
00:55:16.113 --> 00:55:19.149
You tell 'em. Bobby Coleman.
That's what I told them.

1330
00:55:19.249 --> 00:55:21.952
That's my secret. [laughs]

1331
00:55:22.052 --> 00:55:24.789
Can we--can we at
least tell Mom?

1332
00:55:24.889 --> 00:55:26.557
She almost caught me while
I was juggling helping you

1333
00:55:26.657 --> 00:55:28.092
and trying to win regionals.

1334
00:55:28.192 --> 00:55:30.428
I'm sure your mama didn't
think twice about it. Callie.

1335
00:55:30.528 --> 00:55:33.030
-You know your mother.
-[sighs]

1336
00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:35.800
-[Bobby] What's the problem?
-I'm starting to feel guilty.

1337
00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:37.968
I mean. look at us.
We're lying.

1338
00:55:38.068 --> 00:55:41.839
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa. hey.
Hey. Come on. now.

1339
00:55:41.939 --> 00:55:43.974
I'm having a moment in my life.
We all are!

1340
00:55:44.074 --> 00:55:46.477
And for once. hey.
baby girl. for once.

1341
00:55:46.577 --> 00:55:50.981
I'm finally living up
to that thing. huh?

1342
00:55:51.081 --> 00:55:52.617
So let's not go
rock the boat now.

1343
00:55:52.717 --> 00:55:54.419
No. no. no. Just keep
doing what you're doing.

1344
00:55:54.519 --> 00:55:55.853
and you're doing it great.

1345
00:55:55.953 --> 00:55:58.589
Everything will be
just fine. okay?

1346
00:55:58.689 --> 00:56:00.725
Okay.

1347
00:56:00.825 --> 00:56:02.092
Easy for you.
I'm the one doing it.

1348
00:56:02.192 --> 00:56:03.861
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
hey. hey. Callie.

1349
00:56:03.961 --> 00:56:06.063
I'm actually on the field
getting the job done.

1350
00:56:06.163 --> 00:56:08.399
You're just pressing
some buttons a little.

1351
00:56:09.934 --> 00:56:11.836
Just pressing some buttons?
A little?

1352
00:56:11.936 --> 00:56:13.137
[phone buzzing.
notification chime]

1353
00:56:13.237 --> 00:56:14.304
[Bobby] Babe!

1354
00:56:14.405 --> 00:56:19.309
I just hit a million followers!
Ha! [laughs]

1355
00:56:21.412 --> 00:56:23.347
[music]

1356
00:56:23.448 --> 00:56:25.850
The Las Vegas Raiders
have made the trek east

1357
00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:28.118
to take on the Atlanta Falcons

1358
00:56:28.218 --> 00:56:30.821
in a game that is
pivotal for each side

1359
00:56:30.921 --> 00:56:34.659
and just huge for the
Falcons' playoff chances.

1360
00:56:34.759 --> 00:56:36.226
[Tony] Well. they're
going up against

1361
00:56:36.326 --> 00:56:37.828
one of the teams that people
recognize around football

1362
00:56:37.928 --> 00:56:40.531
as one of the toughest
teams in the league.

1363
00:56:40.631 --> 00:56:43.333
So we'll see how
good the Falcons are.

1364
00:56:43.434 --> 00:56:45.870
[Jim] And the Falcons get the
job done on their home turf

1365
00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:48.005
at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

1366
00:56:48.105 --> 00:56:49.640
They know they have
to get this one.

1367
00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:51.008
Can they do it?

1368
00:56:51.108 --> 00:56:53.744
Taylor hands off to
Coleman. who--whoa!

1369
00:56:53.844 --> 00:56:55.546
What is he doing?

1370
00:56:55.646 --> 00:56:57.247
What is circling
inside of his head?

1371
00:56:57.347 --> 00:56:58.549
What is going on?

1372
00:56:58.649 --> 00:56:59.850
[Tony] That's a
great question. Jim.

1373
00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:01.151
We're all actually
asking that because

1374
00:57:01.251 --> 00:57:02.687
Coleman is just running
around in circles.

1375
00:57:02.787 --> 00:57:03.821
Stop messing around!

1376
00:57:03.921 --> 00:57:04.755
[Jim] This is bizarre.

1377
00:57:04.855 --> 00:57:06.423
He's just lost.

1378
00:57:06.524 --> 00:57:09.293
And still running in circles.
going absolutely nowhere.

1379
00:57:09.393 --> 00:57:10.661
[Tony] Hold on a second.

1380
00:57:10.761 --> 00:57:12.362
It looks like
he's changed course.

1381
00:57:12.463 --> 00:57:14.732
Now he's headed directly
for the sidelines.

1382
00:57:14.832 --> 00:57:18.368
What a strange way for
him to start the game.

1383
00:57:18.469 --> 00:57:20.204
What is he doing now. Jim?

1384
00:57:20.304 --> 00:57:23.007
[Jim] Tony. he's lost his mind.
He's just jumping around.

1385
00:57:23.107 --> 00:57:25.075
Coleman is completely out of it.

1386
00:57:25.175 --> 00:57:27.444
[Tony] I don't think jumping
around is going to help.

1387
00:57:28.579 --> 00:57:29.379
[Jim] He passes the ball.

1388
00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:30.314
Come on--

1389
00:57:30.414 --> 00:57:31.381
[Crowd] Oh!

1390
00:57:31.482 --> 00:57:33.083
[Jim] Right in the face!

1391
00:57:33.183 --> 00:57:34.585
Coach Evans!

1392
00:57:34.685 --> 00:57:37.788
[Tony] I think the only one
amused there is Anderson Fisher.

1393
00:57:37.888 --> 00:57:39.256
[Jim] Exactly.

1394
00:57:39.356 --> 00:57:41.391
This isn't funny.
He's out of--

1395
00:57:41.492 --> 00:57:43.060
Right now he's doing the Worm.

1396
00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:46.664
I mean. there's a ground game.
and then there's a ground game.

1397
00:57:46.764 --> 00:57:48.833
But you don't do the Worm.

1398
00:57:48.933 --> 00:57:51.401
[Tony] To be precise.
it's on the 46th yard line.

1399
00:57:51.502 --> 00:57:53.370
He's being ridiculous.

1400
00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:55.305
Hey. Fish time. baby!

1401
00:57:55.405 --> 00:57:56.541
Way to go. Dad!

1402
00:57:56.641 --> 00:57:58.008
[Jim] I don't know
what's happened.

1403
00:57:58.108 --> 00:57:59.877
This is not the same guy
we've seen all season long.

1404
00:57:59.977 --> 00:58:01.579
[Tony] I'm ready to
call it. partner.

1405
00:58:01.679 --> 00:58:04.048
That was definitely one of
the dumbest things I've seen

1406
00:58:04.148 --> 00:58:05.550
on a football field.
[phone ringing. vibrating]

1407
00:58:05.650 --> 00:58:07.752
[Jim] And that will bring
an end to the first quarter.

1408
00:58:07.852 --> 00:58:10.320
which has been
downright memorable

1409
00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:12.022
for all the wrong reasons.

1410
00:58:12.823 --> 00:58:14.825
Hey. Dad!
How's the game going?

1411
00:58:14.925 --> 00:58:16.460
Callie. what are you doing?

1412
00:58:16.561 --> 00:58:17.562
[Callie] What do you mean?

1413
00:58:17.662 --> 00:58:18.996
You're the one doing everything!

1414
00:58:19.096 --> 00:58:21.065
I'm pressing some buttons
to help out a little. right?

1415
00:58:21.165 --> 00:58:22.800
Okay. okay. you made your point.

1416
00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:24.835
We can talk about it
when I get home.

1417
00:58:24.935 --> 00:58:26.236
Now I need you
to turn my play around

1418
00:58:26.336 --> 00:58:28.639
so Anderson don't replace me.
Please.

1419
00:58:28.739 --> 00:58:32.409
Mm. but have you
learned your lesson?

1420
00:58:32.509 --> 00:58:34.478
Coleman! Come on.

1421
00:58:34.579 --> 00:58:36.213
Coming. Coach!
Get my helmet.

1422
00:58:36.313 --> 00:58:38.783
Lesson learned. all right?
Okay. thanks. bye.

1423
00:58:40.517 --> 00:58:43.220
[phone vibrating. text chime]

1424
00:58:45.355 --> 00:58:46.724
Okay.

1425
00:58:46.824 --> 00:58:54.965
[music]

1426
00:58:56.266 --> 00:58:57.868
Uh oh.

1427
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:01.706
Hi.

1428
00:59:01.806 --> 00:59:03.473
Callie...

1429
00:59:03.574 --> 00:59:04.875
We've been talking.

1430
00:59:04.975 --> 00:59:07.444
And with nationals in a week...

1431
00:59:07.544 --> 00:59:08.713
Screw lead-ins.

1432
00:59:08.813 --> 00:59:10.748
You promised us a new robot arm.

1433
00:59:10.848 --> 00:59:12.617
You called it SpongeBot 2.0.

1434
00:59:12.717 --> 00:59:14.719
and yet we haven't seen
anything.

1435
00:59:14.819 --> 00:59:15.953
Well. I mean. it's just taking

1436
00:59:16.053 --> 00:59:18.288
a little bit of
extra time. that's all.

1437
00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:20.024
Everything is coming
together. though.

1438
00:59:20.124 --> 00:59:21.726
I'm just working on it at home.

1439
00:59:21.826 --> 00:59:25.630
Nate knows! Right. Nate?

1440
00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:26.964
Actually. I don't.

1441
00:59:27.064 --> 00:59:29.266
I mean. you can show
us now. if you want.

1442
00:59:29.366 --> 00:59:31.902
Um...

1443
00:59:33.704 --> 00:59:35.339
Okay. well...

1444
00:59:36.807 --> 00:59:39.276
The truth is...
I haven't finished it yet

1445
00:59:40.110 --> 00:59:41.478
because I haven't
started it yet.

1446
00:59:41.578 --> 00:59:43.080
You haven't started it yet?

1447
00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:45.215
[Kayla] Callie. we
were counting on you.

1448
00:59:45.315 --> 00:59:47.852
We didn't work on it
because you said you would.

1449
00:59:47.952 --> 00:59:50.621
Without your changes.
we will be too far behind

1450
00:59:50.721 --> 00:59:51.989
and laughed out of nationals.

1451
00:59:52.089 --> 00:59:53.758
Like. laughed at.
not laughed with.

1452
00:59:53.858 --> 00:59:55.125
I know. it's just. look.

1453
00:59:55.225 --> 00:59:56.994
everything has been crazy
right now with my dad--

1454
00:59:57.094 --> 01:00:00.064
Look. look. stop
with this dad stuff.

1455
01:00:00.164 --> 01:00:02.399
We're not mad at him.
We're mad at you.

1456
01:00:02.499 --> 01:00:04.034
And what happened to
wanting to be Callie Coleman

1457
01:00:04.134 --> 01:00:06.370
and not Bobby Coleman's
daughter?

1458
01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:08.572
[Kayla] You might not
need these scholarships

1459
01:00:08.673 --> 01:00:11.876
because your dad is a
big. famous football player.

1460
01:00:11.976 --> 01:00:13.410
but for some of us.

1461
01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:16.280
that money could actually
make a huge difference!

1462
01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:18.482
[Zoe] I'm gonna need
that iPhone case back.

1463
01:00:18.582 --> 01:00:20.217
And the T-shirt too.

1464
01:00:20.317 --> 01:00:22.887
I didn't know my amazing
craftsmanship would go to waste.

1465
01:00:22.987 --> 01:00:29.459
[sad music]

1466
01:00:29.559 --> 01:00:31.696
[sighs] Fine.

1467
01:00:31.796 --> 01:00:33.898
But maybe. if
anyone actually knew

1468
01:00:33.998 --> 01:00:35.532
what they were
doing on this team.

1469
01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:38.903
this wouldn't be a problem!

1470
01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:43.273
Too smart for this
mediocre crew anyways!

1471
01:00:57.187 --> 01:00:58.422
[Woman] And then there were
the Falcons. right?

1472
01:00:58.522 --> 01:01:01.225
There is no
better story in the NFC

1473
01:01:01.325 --> 01:01:03.560
than Bobby "Comeback" Coleman.

1474
01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:05.195
He ain't all that.

1475
01:01:05.295 --> 01:01:07.397
-- with a record-tying
six touchdown game.

1476
01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:09.934
And now?
He's on the verge of breaking

1477
01:01:10.034 --> 01:01:11.969
the single-season
rushing record.

1478
01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:15.239
Yeah...
I did it first.

1479
01:01:15.339 --> 01:01:16.941
I mean. you just wanna
root for this guy. right?

1480
01:01:17.041 --> 01:01:19.043
Especially when you see
him with his daughter.

1481
01:01:19.143 --> 01:01:20.878
Those two make quite the couple.

1482
01:01:20.978 --> 01:01:22.179
[Woman] Oh. it's adorable.

1483
01:01:22.279 --> 01:01:23.914
But. you know.
just been hanging out.

1484
01:01:24.014 --> 01:01:25.716
playing a whole lot of Madden.

1485
01:01:25.816 --> 01:01:27.918
[Man] Man. I love that
they play Madden together.

1486
01:01:28.018 --> 01:01:29.319
The way Bobby's been playing.

1487
01:01:29.419 --> 01:01:32.256
it seems he's leveled up
in real life.

1488
01:01:32.356 --> 01:01:34.324
It does seem like
that. doesn't it?

1489
01:01:34.424 --> 01:01:35.926
[Man] ...but he might be getting

1490
01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:37.294
a little nervous out there.
if I were him.

1491
01:01:37.394 --> 01:01:38.829
Bobby Coleman's been
toting that rock.

1492
01:01:38.929 --> 01:01:40.530
[Woman] It's like
Anderson who. right?

1493
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:42.166
[ding]

1494
01:01:44.969 --> 01:01:48.505
[thunder rumbling outside]

1495
01:01:52.276 --> 01:01:54.678
That's her exact same schedule.

1496
01:01:58.215 --> 01:02:02.019
[crowd cheering]

1497
01:02:02.586 --> 01:02:04.054
Hold up.

1498
01:02:08.425 --> 01:02:10.961
[dinging]

1499
01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:19.669
[music]

1500
01:02:19.770 --> 01:02:22.272
Those are the exact same plays.

1501
01:02:22.372 --> 01:02:28.745
[music]

1502
01:02:28.846 --> 01:02:32.883
[crowd cheering]

1503
01:02:32.983 --> 01:02:34.584
That's crazy. no.

1504
01:02:37.922 --> 01:02:48.232
[music]

1505
01:02:51.701 --> 01:02:53.070
Thank you.

1506
01:02:53.170 --> 01:02:55.873
Callie! [laughs]

1507
01:02:55.973 --> 01:02:58.775
-We're home!
-We brought you some food!

1508
01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:01.745
Where is she?

1509
01:03:01.846 --> 01:03:03.480
-I'll check on her.
-Okay.

1510
01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:05.382
All right.

1511
01:03:09.987 --> 01:03:11.221
[thunderclap]

1512
01:03:11.321 --> 01:03:12.789
[Bobby] Oh. baby girl.
we got dinner down--

1513
01:03:14.424 --> 01:03:15.792
Callie. what are you doing?

1514
01:03:17.394 --> 01:03:18.662
Put the controller down now.

1515
01:03:18.762 --> 01:03:20.430
I finally felt like
I belonged somewhere

1516
01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:23.067
and now all my friends hate me.

1517
01:03:23.167 --> 01:03:24.501
What are you talking about?

1518
01:03:26.103 --> 01:03:28.172
This game ruined my life.

1519
01:03:28.272 --> 01:03:30.607
Callie. we're dominating!
You're kidding me?

1520
01:03:30.707 --> 01:03:32.576
I'm having the best
season of my career!

1521
01:03:32.676 --> 01:03:33.878
And I'm having the worst!

1522
01:03:33.978 --> 01:03:36.914
Isn't there something
wrong with that?

1523
01:03:37.014 --> 01:03:39.316
Callie. think about
what you're doing.

1524
01:03:41.785 --> 01:03:43.687
No. no. no. no. no. no!

1525
01:03:50.627 --> 01:03:52.562
[ding]

1526
01:03:53.563 --> 01:03:55.699
No. No.

1527
01:03:57.234 --> 01:03:58.969
What are you doing?

1528
01:03:59.069 --> 01:04:00.337
Gotta go to Best Buy. right?

1529
01:04:00.437 --> 01:04:02.539
They--they--they
can recover the data.

1530
01:04:02.639 --> 01:04:05.342
Geek Squad. don't fail me now.
That whole thing?

1531
01:04:05.442 --> 01:04:06.310
[zapping]

1532
01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:08.212
[Callie]
Come on. leave it alone!

1533
01:04:11.315 --> 01:04:14.751
Don't--Dad. what are you doing?
It's over! It's over!

1534
01:04:16.053 --> 01:04:18.288
-Dad. look. stop!
-Hey!

1535
01:04:18.388 --> 01:04:21.458
You're not gonna get it back.
It's gone. it's gone!

1536
01:04:21.558 --> 01:04:25.495
No. Callie. I'm taking it!
Give me the game!

1537
01:04:25.595 --> 01:04:26.563
Callie. Callie!

1538
01:04:26.663 --> 01:04:28.632
I wish none of this
had ever happened!

1539
01:04:28.732 --> 01:04:32.736
[zapping]

1540
01:04:34.638 --> 01:04:37.674
You guys are insane!
What is going on with you two?

1541
01:04:38.742 --> 01:04:41.678
-Is this about that video game?
-No. it's not just the game.

1542
01:04:41.778 --> 01:04:44.314
What she really means is more
of a metaphor. right Callie?

1543
01:04:44.414 --> 01:04:46.750
No!

1544
01:04:46.850 --> 01:04:50.854
This game has some sort of
weird body controlling thing.

1545
01:04:50.955 --> 01:04:52.556
Please feel free
to expand on that.

1546
01:04:52.656 --> 01:04:55.392
Mom. whatever I do in the game.
it happens in real life.

1547
01:04:55.492 --> 01:04:58.162
That's the reason
Dad's been playing so well!

1548
01:04:59.196 --> 01:05:02.799
[laughs]

1549
01:05:02.899 --> 01:05:05.435
Callie Amber Coleman.
is that what you think?

1550
01:05:05.535 --> 01:05:08.438
It's true. It's true. Keish.

1551
01:05:10.007 --> 01:05:11.408
I know it does sound insane.

1552
01:05:11.508 --> 01:05:14.344
but the game has some
sort of power over me.

1553
01:05:14.444 --> 01:05:16.513
Or at least. it used to.

1554
01:05:16.613 --> 01:05:18.949
-And now I got nothin'!
-Excuse me?

1555
01:05:19.049 --> 01:05:20.384
Your daughter and
I are not nothin'.

1556
01:05:20.484 --> 01:05:21.885
But we'll come back to that.

1557
01:05:21.986 --> 01:05:24.288
Because what I just heard
come out of both of your faces

1558
01:05:24.388 --> 01:05:27.191
is that whatever Callie
does in a video game.

1559
01:05:27.291 --> 01:05:28.825
Bobby mirrors on the
field move for move.

1560
01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:31.228
Is that correct?

1561
01:05:31.328 --> 01:05:33.530
And you two aren't
messing with me?

1562
01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:38.302
How could you two keep
something like this a secret?

1563
01:05:38.402 --> 01:05:39.736
Mom. I'm sorry. I
wanted to tell you.

1564
01:05:39.836 --> 01:05:41.071
but Dad said not to--

1565
01:05:41.171 --> 01:05:42.639
Wait. wait. wait.
you're sorry about that?

1566
01:05:42.739 --> 01:05:46.043
How 'bout the fact that you just
made all of my skills disappear?

1567
01:05:46.143 --> 01:05:48.212
Gone. poof. just like that!

1568
01:05:48.312 --> 01:05:50.347
And right before the
playoffs are about to start?

1569
01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:52.549
And by the way. I was about
to break the rushing record.

1570
01:05:52.649 --> 01:05:55.752
That's literally
all you care about!

1571
01:05:56.853 --> 01:05:59.523
Callie...
Baby girl...

1572
01:05:59.623 --> 01:06:01.225
This was a win/win
for both of us.

1573
01:06:01.325 --> 01:06:02.692
And all our dreams
were finally coming true.

1574
01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:04.628
Your dreams!

1575
01:06:04.728 --> 01:06:07.131
But what about me?

1576
01:06:07.231 --> 01:06:09.166
I was finally starting
to become my own person!

1577
01:06:09.266 --> 01:06:11.735
Not everything
is just about you!

1578
01:06:15.272 --> 01:06:18.808
You told our daughter
to lie to me?

1579
01:06:18.908 --> 01:06:20.277
-Listen. Keisha...
-No.

1580
01:06:20.377 --> 01:06:22.446
You don't get to talk right now.

1581
01:06:22.546 --> 01:06:24.414
What happened to
us being a unit?

1582
01:06:24.514 --> 01:06:27.051
I mean. I get it.
You're Mr. Bigshot on the field.

1583
01:06:27.151 --> 01:06:31.621
But in this house?
We're partners.

1584
01:06:31.721 --> 01:06:35.759
And right now...it sure
doesn't feel that way.

1585
01:06:35.859 --> 01:06:37.661
-I mean. Keisha--
-No.

1586
01:06:37.761 --> 01:06:39.496
Callie!

1587
01:06:43.033 --> 01:06:45.969
[thunderclap]
[rain pattering]

1588
01:06:50.074 --> 01:06:51.908
* Yeah. well you the GOAT

1589
01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:57.414
Hey. first game of the playoffs.
baby. let's go!

1590
01:06:57.514 --> 01:07:00.550
Hey. you ready to bring some
of that Bobby Coleman action?

1591
01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:02.452
You know it!
You know it!

1592
01:07:02.552 --> 01:07:05.289
[indistinct chatter]

1593
01:07:10.294 --> 01:07:12.662
Coleman!

1594
01:07:12.762 --> 01:07:14.331
Where's Bobby?

1595
01:07:14.431 --> 01:07:17.167
-Coleman. there you are.
-[Man] That sweater is terrible!

1596
01:07:17.267 --> 01:07:19.035
I know your secret.

1597
01:07:19.136 --> 01:07:21.771
I know all about what you and
your little daughter been up to.

1598
01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:22.706
Check it out. Joe.

1599
01:07:22.806 --> 01:07:24.108
When his daughter plays Madden.

1600
01:07:24.208 --> 01:07:25.975
it makes him good
at actual football.

1601
01:07:26.076 --> 01:07:28.512
Everything she does on the
game he does on the field.

1602
01:07:28.612 --> 01:07:30.314
Yo. no offense. but what?

1603
01:07:30.414 --> 01:07:32.549
Look. I don't know
how you're doing it.

1604
01:07:32.649 --> 01:07:35.018
but I got proof.
I got proof!

1605
01:07:35.119 --> 01:07:36.953
His daughter recorded
her Madden gameplay.

1606
01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:39.256
and it was exactly the same
as his six-touchdown game

1607
01:07:39.356 --> 01:07:41.258
a few months back.

1608
01:07:41.358 --> 01:07:42.759
-Hey. I just leveled up!
-Scoot over.

1609
01:07:42.859 --> 01:07:45.629
-[Man] Come on. now!
-[Man] What you doin'?

1610
01:07:45.729 --> 01:07:46.696
[Man] Give the controller back.

1611
01:07:46.796 --> 01:07:49.065
[Anderson]
[laughs gleefully]

1612
01:07:49.166 --> 01:07:51.101
[Man] What's wrong. man?

1613
01:07:51.201 --> 01:07:52.436
[Man] What you doin'?

1614
01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:55.071
[buzzer]
What?

1615
01:07:55.639 --> 01:07:57.441
[buzzer]
No. no. Where is it?

1616
01:07:57.541 --> 01:07:59.109
No. no. it was right here.
I saw it.

1617
01:07:59.209 --> 01:08:00.744
She recorded it.

1618
01:08:00.844 --> 01:08:03.747
Look. y'all remember when
he had that six-touchdown game.

1619
01:08:03.847 --> 01:08:05.849
Right? It was the same on
Madden . too!

1620
01:08:08.285 --> 01:08:11.020
Admit it. Bobby!

1621
01:08:11.121 --> 01:08:12.556
You and that daughter of yours?

1622
01:08:12.656 --> 01:08:14.858
Y'all made some kind of deal
with a real-life game genie.

1623
01:08:14.958 --> 01:08:16.826
Boom! Busted!

1624
01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:19.529
[indistinct chatter]

1625
01:08:27.036 --> 01:08:29.639
[laughs]

1626
01:08:29.739 --> 01:08:34.077
[Players join in laughter]

1627
01:08:36.746 --> 01:08:41.017
[laughs]
Wake up. fam!

1628
01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:42.752
In. like. one day he
went from rickety old man

1629
01:08:42.852 --> 01:08:44.854
to some kind of
superhero overnight?

1630
01:08:44.954 --> 01:08:47.457
What do you think caused that?
Multivitamins?

1631
01:08:47.557 --> 01:08:49.293
I think not.
You know what it was?

1632
01:08:49.393 --> 01:08:51.361
It was his magical video game.

1633
01:08:51.461 --> 01:08:53.463
That's right. Bobby.
I figured it out.

1634
01:08:53.563 --> 01:08:55.865
-I got my butt back.
-You got your butt back?

1635
01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:57.000
It's a Gen Z thing.

1636
01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:59.569
[Bobby] Hey. hey.

1637
01:08:59.669 --> 01:09:01.238
Why don't we just play football?

1638
01:09:01.338 --> 01:09:03.273
Right. AF?

1639
01:09:03.373 --> 01:09:04.574
Just play ball.

1640
01:09:04.674 --> 01:09:06.376
'Cause you sound crazy.

1641
01:09:06.476 --> 01:09:07.644
-I'm not crazy. y'all.
-[Bobby] You sound crazy.

1642
01:09:07.744 --> 01:09:10.079
I'm not crazy.
I'm not going insane.

1643
01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:11.315
It was on the game!

1644
01:09:11.415 --> 01:09:13.950
Man. shut up!
I'm with Bobby.

1645
01:09:14.050 --> 01:09:15.485
[screams]

1646
01:09:15.585 --> 01:09:17.187
That boy crazy. man.

1647
01:09:17.287 --> 01:09:19.155
[indistinct chatter]

1648
01:09:19.256 --> 01:09:21.425
-Let's focus up.
-It's on the game.

1649
01:09:21.525 --> 01:09:24.294
[indistinct chatter]

1650
01:09:24.394 --> 01:09:25.829
[Player] Yeeeaahhh!

1651
01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:28.465
[Crowd on TV]
[cheers and applause]

1652
01:09:28.565 --> 01:09:30.033
It's starting.
if you wanna watch!

1653
01:09:30.133 --> 01:09:31.735
[Callie] I'm good!

1654
01:09:32.236 --> 01:09:33.603
[Jim] Taylor. the quarterback.

1655
01:09:33.703 --> 01:09:35.439
Coleman in the back field.

1656
01:09:35.539 --> 01:09:37.341
And they'll hand it off
to Coleman.

1657
01:09:37.441 --> 01:09:39.643
Oh! He fumbles right away.

1658
01:09:39.743 --> 01:09:42.512
But the Falcons do
keep possession.

1659
01:09:42.612 --> 01:09:43.847
Now they throw it to Coleman.

1660
01:09:43.947 --> 01:09:45.782
And it goes directly
through his hands.

1661
01:09:45.882 --> 01:09:47.251
Bobby!

1662
01:09:47.351 --> 01:09:49.486
[Tony] Jim. as I suspected.
Bobby Coleman's going out

1663
01:09:49.586 --> 01:09:51.655
and Anderson Fisher's coming in.

1664
01:09:51.755 --> 01:09:53.156
[Jim] You can't blame him.

1665
01:09:53.257 --> 01:09:55.392
Coleman just doesn't
look like himself out there.

1666
01:09:55.492 --> 01:09:56.593
[Tony] Yeah. well.
technically. Jim.

1667
01:09:56.693 --> 01:09:58.262
he hasn't looked
like himself all season.

1668
01:09:58.362 --> 01:09:59.929
I mean. he started off on fire.

1669
01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:02.832
But today we saw him revert
back to that fumble-throwing guy

1670
01:10:02.932 --> 01:10:05.335
that we've seen throughout
most of his NFL career.

1671
01:10:05.435 --> 01:10:08.004
Isn't this the worst?

1672
01:10:08.104 --> 01:10:09.439
What?

1673
01:10:09.539 --> 01:10:11.275
Feeling bad for
someone you're mad at.

1674
01:10:11.375 --> 01:10:12.976
Takes all the fun out of it.

1675
01:10:13.076 --> 01:10:16.079
I mean. no matter how
angry I get at that man--

1676
01:10:16.179 --> 01:10:19.416
and he can test me--

1677
01:10:19.516 --> 01:10:21.818
I never wanna see him struggle.

1678
01:10:21.918 --> 01:10:25.989
And we both know
he's had his struggles.

1679
01:10:26.089 --> 01:10:29.426
But that's the thing
about loving someone.

1680
01:10:29.526 --> 01:10:33.530
You never stop rooting for them.

1681
01:10:39.135 --> 01:10:40.937
[sighs]

1682
01:10:42.071 --> 01:10:43.473
[Man on radio]
Thanks to Anderson Fisher.

1683
01:10:43.573 --> 01:10:45.275
the Falcons were able
to eke out the win today

1684
01:10:45.375 --> 01:10:46.510
to keep their season alive.

1685
01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:47.844
Man. but how about
Bobby Coleman?

1686
01:10:47.944 --> 01:10:49.313
Looks like his
so-called resurgence

1687
01:10:49.413 --> 01:10:50.514
was just a fluke.

1688
01:10:50.614 --> 01:10:51.581
Pathetic!

1689
01:10:51.681 --> 01:10:53.583
I say just retire.

1690
01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:59.155
Keisha?
Look. I apologize--

1691
01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:00.690
Not now.
I can't find Callie.

1692
01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:02.392
She left after the game and
she hasn't answered her phone

1693
01:11:02.492 --> 01:11:03.560
for two hours.

1694
01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:05.061
Has she mentioned any plans?

1695
01:11:05.161 --> 01:11:06.930
No. she's got that robotics
competition thing coming up

1696
01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:08.798
and she might be at
the school. but let's go.

1697
01:11:08.898 --> 01:11:10.099
Okay.

1698
01:11:15.705 --> 01:11:18.775
Excuse me? Hi.
We're Callie's parents.

1699
01:11:18.875 --> 01:11:20.877
Oh yeah. we met at your
house the other day. right?

1700
01:11:20.977 --> 01:11:22.546
Wait. he was at our house?
When was this?

1701
01:11:22.646 --> 01:11:24.180
Not now. not now.
We're looking for Callie.

1702
01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:29.353
Uh. we kind of had to
kick her off of the team.

1703
01:11:29.453 --> 01:11:32.055
Wait. why?
She loves it so much.

1704
01:11:32.155 --> 01:11:33.790
Yeah. see. she was
supposed to figure out

1705
01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:36.393
this big element
of our robot. but--

1706
01:11:36.493 --> 01:11:38.027
no offense to Mr. Coleman--

1707
01:11:38.127 --> 01:11:40.864
she was so consumed
by your success

1708
01:11:40.964 --> 01:11:46.269
that she didn't really
have much time left for us.

1709
01:11:46.370 --> 01:11:48.338
And she's super good.
I mean. she the whole reason

1710
01:11:48.438 --> 01:11:49.806
we even made it
to the nationals.

1711
01:11:49.906 --> 01:11:51.441
Yeah. well. now she
is the whole reason why

1712
01:11:51.541 --> 01:11:54.478
we are completely screwed.

1713
01:11:54.578 --> 01:11:56.713
Uh. sorry for the language.

1714
01:11:56.813 --> 01:11:59.148
It's just I don't think
we're gonna find another Callie

1715
01:11:59.248 --> 01:12:01.017
before nationals.

1716
01:12:01.117 --> 01:12:02.619
Lightning definitely
doesn't strike twice.

1717
01:12:02.719 --> 01:12:05.955
[thunderclap]

1718
01:12:06.055 --> 01:12:07.857
-I know where she is.
-Where?

1719
01:12:07.957 --> 01:12:09.626
Babe. I know where she is.
Thank you! Thank you!

1720
01:12:09.726 --> 01:12:11.495
And sorry.

1721
01:12:11.595 --> 01:12:16.065
[music]

1722
01:12:23.607 --> 01:12:24.741
[Bobby] Right there!
There she is.

1723
01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:26.943
[Keisha] What in the
world is she doing?

1724
01:12:29.479 --> 01:12:31.481
[Bobby] Callie! Callie!

1725
01:12:31.581 --> 01:12:33.249
Dad. please stop!

1726
01:12:33.349 --> 01:12:34.651
I'm trying to fix this!

1727
01:12:34.751 --> 01:12:36.420
All I need to do is get
struck by lightning again.

1728
01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:37.887
-Baby girl. no!
-Baby. this is insane.

1729
01:12:37.987 --> 01:12:40.590
-You're gonna get hurt!
-But it's all my fault!

1730
01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:42.526
I mean. everything was
great until I ruined it.

1731
01:12:42.626 --> 01:12:45.294
No. you said it--we're a team.

1732
01:12:45.395 --> 01:12:46.596
You didn't drop the ball.

1733
01:12:46.696 --> 01:12:48.498
I'm the one who
dropped the ball.

1734
01:12:48.598 --> 01:12:51.100
You've already given me so much.
You have!

1735
01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:52.869
And now you're
standing in the rain.

1736
01:12:52.969 --> 01:12:55.271
trying to get yourself
struck by lightning.

1737
01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:57.674
-all for me again.
-But football is your life!

1738
01:12:57.774 --> 01:13:01.845
No. baby.
No! You're my life.

1739
01:13:01.945 --> 01:13:04.213
Don't you see? It's you.

1740
01:13:04.313 --> 01:13:07.617
And you're smarter and more
talented than I could ever be.

1741
01:13:07.717 --> 01:13:09.018
You led your team to nationals!

1742
01:13:09.118 --> 01:13:10.654
Yeah. and then I
let them all down!

1743
01:13:10.754 --> 01:13:12.121
[Bobby] No. no. no.
that's no me too. okay?

1744
01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:14.591
I just got caught up. you
know. in all the attention.

1745
01:13:14.691 --> 01:13:16.926
I didn't think about
how it affected you.

1746
01:13:17.026 --> 01:13:18.294
Then I asked you to
lie to your mother.

1747
01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:20.630
I shouldn't have asked
you to lie to anyone.

1748
01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:26.235
So. I'm sorry. okay?
You hear me?

1749
01:13:26.335 --> 01:13:27.671
I'm sorry.

1750
01:13:28.772 --> 01:13:31.875
I'm sorry to you.
and I'm sorry to you.

1751
01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:36.245
I guess I thought that
being on top of the world

1752
01:13:36.345 --> 01:13:38.347
would mean that I could
give you both the world.

1753
01:13:38.448 --> 01:13:41.350
But really you just wanted
me right here. present.

1754
01:13:41.451 --> 01:13:44.153
So I'm here. present.

1755
01:13:45.989 --> 01:13:47.691
I mean. with the playoffs
and everything. it's just--

1756
01:13:47.791 --> 01:13:51.961
No. hey. come here. come here.
Come here.

1757
01:13:54.163 --> 01:13:57.601
It's just a game.
You get it?

1758
01:13:57.701 --> 01:14:01.304
The playoffs...
It's just a game.

1759
01:14:01.404 --> 01:14:05.775
You mean everything to me.
You and your mama.

1760
01:14:11.581 --> 01:14:14.050
[sighs]

1761
01:14:14.150 --> 01:14:15.652
We really need to
get out of this rain

1762
01:14:15.752 --> 01:14:17.086
because we're going
to get pneumonia.

1763
01:14:17.186 --> 01:14:18.087
Please come over.

1764
01:14:18.187 --> 01:14:20.990
Mom. pneumonia's
a little extreme.

1765
01:14:21.090 --> 01:14:23.159
Worst-case scenario.
it's probably just the sniffles.

1766
01:14:23.259 --> 01:14:27.096
[Keisha] Please. just trust me.
I am a medical professional.

1767
01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:35.905
[music]

1768
01:14:44.548 --> 01:14:49.653
[music]

1769
01:14:49.753 --> 01:14:51.521
-Good morning!
-Whoa!

1770
01:14:51.621 --> 01:14:53.757
-Ha. ha. ha.
-What's going on?

1771
01:14:53.857 --> 01:14:55.258
Let's go. let's go.
We got work to do.

1772
01:14:55.358 --> 01:14:56.626
What?

1773
01:14:56.726 --> 01:14:58.728
Come on. come on.

1774
01:14:58.828 --> 01:15:01.130
It's 6 o'clock in the
morning on a Saturday.

1775
01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:04.067
Yeah. This isn't about me.
Today is not about me.

1776
01:15:04.167 --> 01:15:05.434
-Come on!
-Dad. Dad. stop.

1777
01:15:05.535 --> 01:15:07.270
We gotta go. Hey. hey!

1778
01:15:07.370 --> 01:15:09.906
You drivin'. Miss Thing.

1779
01:15:10.006 --> 01:15:12.175
That's right.
I'll see you downstairs.

1780
01:15:12.275 --> 01:15:14.210
Breakfast on the table.
Let's rock!

1781
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:18.548
[music]

1782
01:15:18.648 --> 01:15:22.786
The most important game
of your career is tomorrow.

1783
01:15:22.886 --> 01:15:25.354
Are you sure you wanna
spend your day here?

1784
01:15:25.454 --> 01:15:27.557
Yeah. I do.

1785
01:15:27.657 --> 01:15:28.858
You get this thing done.

1786
01:15:28.958 --> 01:15:30.326
you guys still have
a shot at nationals.

1787
01:15:30.426 --> 01:15:33.096
I'm gonna stay here. help you as
long as it takes to get it done.

1788
01:15:33.196 --> 01:15:34.764
All right?

1789
01:15:34.864 --> 01:15:38.001
But I do have one question.

1790
01:15:38.101 --> 01:15:39.836
What is all of this stuff?

1791
01:15:39.936 --> 01:15:42.939
And. uh. how does
any of it work?

1792
01:15:43.973 --> 01:15:46.042
* Oh no. got me goin' loco

1793
01:15:46.142 --> 01:15:47.744
* Make me go berserk-o

1794
01:15:47.844 --> 01:15:49.378
* Shake it in a circle

1795
01:15:49.478 --> 01:15:50.479
* Circle

1796
01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:52.616
* Oh no. got me goin' loco

1797
01:15:52.716 --> 01:15:54.417
* Gotta put in work. though

1798
01:15:54.517 --> 01:15:56.586
[clanking]

1799
01:15:56.686 --> 01:16:01.891
[music]

1800
01:16:01.991 --> 01:16:02.992
* Make it work

1801
01:16:03.092 --> 01:16:04.828
* Lo--lo--lo--loco

1802
01:16:06.896 --> 01:16:08.464
Lookin' sharp.

1803
01:16:08.564 --> 01:16:10.066
* Loco

1804
01:16:11.434 --> 01:16:12.168
What's wrong?

1805
01:16:12.268 --> 01:16:17.340
Uh. there's a piece missing.

1806
01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:20.409
A small bronze cylinder
about this big here.

1807
01:16:20.509 --> 01:16:21.978
See?

1808
01:16:22.078 --> 01:16:23.479
It's supposed to be
here as a counterweight

1809
01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:25.148
for this upper joint.

1810
01:16:25.248 --> 01:16:27.116
The arm won't work without it.

1811
01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:30.219
Ah. what about this?

1812
01:16:32.288 --> 01:16:33.623
Nope.

1813
01:16:33.723 --> 01:16:35.692
See. this one is too light to
provide the torque that we need.

1814
01:16:35.792 --> 01:16:37.761
I've torqued about enough.

1815
01:16:37.861 --> 01:16:39.495
[laughs]

1816
01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:42.966
Without the counterweight.
the balance is off.

1817
01:16:43.066 --> 01:16:46.535
And you say that it's a bronze
cylinder about this big?

1818
01:16:48.905 --> 01:16:51.007
Come with me. Come on.

1819
01:16:54.778 --> 01:16:56.512
I don't think
I completely understand.

1820
01:16:56.612 --> 01:16:59.415
You want me to cut off the
arm of your Heisman Trophy?

1821
01:16:59.515 --> 01:17:01.617
Yeah. because this
young lady right here.

1822
01:17:01.718 --> 01:17:03.953
well. she matters way more to me
than some piece of metal. right?

1823
01:17:04.053 --> 01:17:06.589
So just cut that arm
right off my Heisman.

1824
01:17:06.690 --> 01:17:09.926
[laughs]
We got a robot to build.

1825
01:17:10.026 --> 01:17:11.761
Wow. uh. it seems like

1826
01:17:11.861 --> 01:17:14.230
I'm missing some
significant context here.

1827
01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:16.432
But we don't have to do that.

1828
01:17:16.532 --> 01:17:19.803
I can just sell you
a piece of bronze.

1829
01:17:19.903 --> 01:17:22.071
-Oh.
-I mean. is that okay?

1830
01:17:22.171 --> 01:17:23.239
I mean. that way you can have

1831
01:17:23.339 --> 01:17:24.808
your cake and eat
it too. you know?

1832
01:17:24.908 --> 01:17:26.109
-Way better.
-[Man] Okay.

1833
01:17:26.209 --> 01:17:28.111
-Way better.
-I'm gonna go get the bronze.

1834
01:17:28.211 --> 01:17:30.346
I will be back.
Don't go anywhere.

1835
01:17:30.446 --> 01:17:32.548
-Win-win.
-Yeah.

1836
01:17:32.648 --> 01:17:34.250
[laughs]

1837
01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:37.220
[robot whirring]

1838
01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:39.255
Um. guys!?

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:46.529
SpongeBot SpareParts!

1841
01:17:46.629 --> 01:17:49.332
Ooh. with a new arm. too.

[digital beeping]

1843
01:17:51.367 --> 01:17:52.802
[Callie] Hey. it's Callie.

1844
01:17:52.902 --> 01:17:55.471
Um. I owe you an apology.

1845
01:17:55.571 --> 01:17:58.307
You were relying on me.
and I didn't deliver.

1846
01:17:58.407 --> 01:18:01.144
If you don't want me back.
I completely understand.

1847
01:18:01.244 --> 01:18:03.747
But y'all mean everything to me.

1848
01:18:03.847 --> 01:18:05.114
Either way. I want you to take

1849
01:18:05.214 --> 01:18:07.150
this finished
SpongeBot 2.0 to nationals

1850
01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:09.318
and destroy the competition.

1851
01:18:09.418 --> 01:18:13.189
and also crush. obliterate.
and annihilate them.

1852
01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:15.725
[screams]

1853
01:18:15.825 --> 01:18:17.360
Oh. jeez.

1854
01:18:19.695 --> 01:18:20.696
-You good?
-Yeah. yeah.

1855
01:18:20.797 --> 01:18:22.065
Um...

1856
01:18:22.165 --> 01:18:23.532
That was. um...

1857
01:18:23.632 --> 01:18:25.268
That was supposed to
be a way cooler reveal.

1858
01:18:25.368 --> 01:18:28.104
Wow. hiding in a tree. yeah.
That's creepy.

1859
01:18:28.204 --> 01:18:29.405
Yeah. it's not my best look.

1860
01:18:29.505 --> 01:18:32.108
Look. I'm sorry for
the mean things I said.

1861
01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:33.877
Yeah. me too. it
got pretty brutal.

1862
01:18:33.977 --> 01:18:36.079
Yeah. and I'm sorry for. um...

1863
01:18:36.179 --> 01:18:39.215
Well. SpongeBot kind of
covered it.

1864
01:18:39.315 --> 01:18:44.320
I. uh. think these
belong to you.

1865
01:18:45.955 --> 01:18:47.323
What do you guys think?

1866
01:18:47.423 --> 01:18:48.758
Shall we see what this
little guy can do?

1867
01:18:48.858 --> 01:18:49.759
[Group] Yes!

1868
01:18:49.859 --> 01:18:51.327

Go long.

1872
01:19:04.273 --> 01:19:06.309
[Margo] Launch it!

1873
01:19:06.876 --> 01:19:07.777
Oh my god. Oliver!

1874
01:19:07.877 --> 01:19:09.345
So. um...

1875
01:19:09.445 --> 01:19:10.513
[Kayla] You were
supposed to catch it

1876
01:19:10.613 --> 01:19:12.315
so it doesn't break
our windshield!

1877
01:19:12.415 --> 01:19:13.516
Are we cool?

1878
01:19:13.616 --> 01:19:17.286
Even though I acted very
weird when you came over?

1879
01:19:17.386 --> 01:19:19.688
-Yeah. we cool.
-Okay.

1880
01:19:19.789 --> 01:19:23.326
And for the record...

1881
01:19:23.426 --> 01:19:26.195
you being incredibly weird
is the reason I like you.

1882

1883
01:19:32.135 --> 01:19:34.203
Uh. I'ma head home. all right?

1884
01:19:34.303 --> 01:19:37.006
You stay and enjoy your friends.

1885
01:19:37.106 --> 01:19:39.642
And the car is
yours for the day.

1886
01:19:39.742 --> 01:19:41.644
[laughs] Thank you!

1887
01:19:41.744 --> 01:19:43.246
[horn honking]

1888
01:19:45.248 --> 01:19:47.483
Your mom just pulled up
to pick me up.

1889
01:19:47.583 --> 01:19:48.717
And be safe.

1890
01:19:48.818 --> 01:19:49.986
[laughs]

1891
01:19:50.086 --> 01:19:51.855
-Hey!
-Hey.

1892
01:19:51.955 --> 01:19:54.390
I'm Nate.

1893
01:19:54.490 --> 01:19:58.194
Nathaniel? Nate.

1894
01:19:58.294 --> 01:20:01.164
You can call me Nathaniel.

1895
01:20:01.264 --> 01:20:03.499
We didn't really actually
get a chance to meet?

1896
01:20:03.599 --> 01:20:05.668
I just wanted to let you know
that it's been a pleasure

1897
01:20:05.768 --> 01:20:07.937
-being with your daughter.
-Ooh. say what?

1898
01:20:08.037 --> 01:20:13.576
Um. uh. having contact with
her--interpersonally. though.

1899
01:20:13.676 --> 01:20:15.811
Because of robotics?

1900
01:20:15.912 --> 01:20:17.013
Yeah. because of robotics.

1901
01:20:17.113 --> 01:20:20.249
[laughs] Robotics.

1902
01:20:20.349 --> 01:20:24.687
Look. it's an honor to
meet you. Mr. Bobby. Robert...

1903
01:20:24.787 --> 01:20:27.023
-Mr. Coleman is perfect.
-Right. Mr. Coleman.

1904
01:20:27.123 --> 01:20:29.458
-Mr. Coleman.
-Yeah.

1905
01:20:29.558 --> 01:20:31.427
[Bobby] Well. thank you. Nate.

1906
01:20:31.527 --> 01:20:32.962
Pleasure to meet
you too. young man.

1907
01:20:33.062 --> 01:20:37.700
And remember. I
got my eye on you.

1908
01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:38.734
-Right.
-Right.

1909
01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:40.636
Right.

1910
01:20:41.204 --> 01:20:42.505
* Are you ready?

1911
01:20:42.605 --> 01:20:44.307
[Tony] Jim. the energy
here at Mercedes-Benz

1912
01:20:44.407 --> 01:20:46.275
is electric.
A sold-out crowd

1913
01:20:46.375 --> 01:20:48.377
is hoping to see their Falcons

1914
01:20:48.477 --> 01:20:50.213
punch their ticket
to the Super Bowl.

1915
01:20:50.313 --> 01:20:51.881
But they gotta go through
the Saints here today.

1916
01:20:51.981 --> 01:20:52.949
That's right. partner.

1917
01:20:53.049 --> 01:20:54.750
And all eyes are
on Bobby Coleman.

1918
01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:57.286
who's had the Cinderella season.

1919
01:20:57.386 --> 01:21:00.656
But he came out last game
looking like Sleeping Beauty.

1920
01:21:00.756 --> 01:21:02.391
Yes. but even after
that performance.

1921
01:21:02.491 --> 01:21:05.161
he's still just 45 yards
away from overtaking

1922
01:21:05.261 --> 01:21:08.264
Anderson Fisher's
single-season rushing record.

1923
01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:10.033
But the big question
is. will Coach Evans

1924
01:21:10.133 --> 01:21:12.135
give him the minutes
he needs to do it?

1925
01:21:12.235 --> 01:21:15.138
-These seats are incredible!
-Okay.

1926
01:21:15.238 --> 01:21:18.107
-You do this every Sunday?
-Um...

1927
01:21:18.207 --> 01:21:20.043
This season's been
a little different.

1928
01:21:20.143 --> 01:21:22.979
Yo. I'll take a dog!
Oh. dog. you want a dog?

1929
01:21:23.079 --> 01:21:24.747
Make that double dog!
With kraut.

1930
01:21:24.847 --> 01:21:28.484
Everybody gets a sign.

1931
01:21:28.851 --> 01:21:31.420
Callie. you are
the exclamation point.

1932
01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:33.156
Oh. Ms. Coleman. I'm sorry.

1933
01:21:33.256 --> 01:21:34.423
I should've
brought you one too.

1934
01:21:34.523 --> 01:21:35.691
[Keisha] It's okay. honey.

1935
01:21:35.791 --> 01:21:38.627
I consider myself a
human exclamation point.

1936
01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:40.263
Okay.

1937
01:21:40.363 --> 01:21:44.633
[Jim] And the NFC
championship game is underway.

1938
01:21:44.733 --> 01:21:47.036
And this will go
for a touchback.

1939
01:21:47.136 --> 01:21:48.337
Signs up! Signs up!

1940
01:21:48.437 --> 01:21:51.140
[cheers and applause]

1941
01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:52.608
Come on. Bobby!

1942
01:21:52.708 --> 01:21:54.810
[Tony] Coach Evans going
with Bobby Coleman.

1943
01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:57.480
Wow. I can't believe
it. but I love it.

1944
01:22:02.151 --> 01:22:03.987
[Jim] And Coleman.
right off the bat.

1945
01:22:04.087 --> 01:22:05.821
is hit hard for a loss.

1946
01:22:06.722 --> 01:22:07.991
[Tony] Well. the
Saints are not gonna

1947
01:22:08.091 --> 01:22:09.458
make this easy
for Bobby Coleman.

1948
01:22:09.558 --> 01:22:13.096
Get it together. Bobby!
They're crushing you out there!

1949
01:22:13.196 --> 01:22:15.598
-Your mom is a little...
-Passionate?

1950
01:22:15.698 --> 01:22:19.202
-I was gonna say terrifying.
-Yeah. that too.

1951
01:22:19.302 --> 01:22:23.072
[Jim] And now the Saints head to
the end zone on a quick strike.

1952
01:22:23.172 --> 01:22:24.640
Taylor going deep.

1953
01:22:26.675 --> 01:22:29.278
And it's caught.
Touchdown. Falcons.

1954
01:22:29.378 --> 01:22:30.879
[Tony] Taylor with
a perfect throw.

1955
01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:34.283
That's how you gotta score
against this defense.

1956
01:22:35.484 --> 01:22:38.121
[Jim] Handoff. Coleman.
And he fumbles it.

1957
01:22:38.221 --> 01:22:39.888
And the Saints recover.

1958
01:22:39.989 --> 01:22:43.026
[Tony] All of last week's
troubles not quite behind him.

1959
01:22:43.126 --> 01:22:44.360
And touchdown. Saints.

1960
01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:47.430
And they do the little
bowling ball!

1961
01:22:47.530 --> 01:22:50.399
[Jim] Saints are feeling
comfortable in enemy territory.

1962
01:22:50.499 --> 01:22:53.902
And oh. Coleman once
again coughs it up.

1963
01:22:54.003 --> 01:22:56.305
[Tony] That's it.
Coach Evans says you're done.

1964
01:22:56.405 --> 01:22:58.507
I'm going to Anderson Fisher.

1965
01:23:00.009 --> 01:23:02.611
[Jim] And Fisher looking
like he did last year.

1966
01:23:02.711 --> 01:23:05.314
Into the end zone for sixth.

1967
01:23:06.415 --> 01:23:07.450
How do you handle this?

1968
01:23:07.550 --> 01:23:08.551
It's like my heart
is gonna explode!

1969
01:23:08.651 --> 01:23:09.885
You gotta let it out. man.

1970
01:23:09.985 --> 01:23:11.487
Come on. scream with me.

1971
01:23:11.587 --> 01:23:12.921
[screams]

1972
01:23:13.022 --> 01:23:14.323
[screams]

1973
01:23:14.423 --> 01:23:15.858
[Jim] And folks. the
game is essentially

1974
01:23:15.958 --> 01:23:17.326
coming down to this.

1975
01:23:18.527 --> 01:23:22.098
One final chance
for the Falcons.

1976
01:23:22.198 --> 01:23:23.766
[Tony] They're trying
to get lined up.

1977
01:23:23.866 --> 01:23:25.334
But the nerves are
here. you can tell.

1978
01:23:25.434 --> 01:23:27.536
Look at this.

1979
01:23:27.970 --> 01:23:29.572
42!

1980
01:23:29.672 --> 01:23:31.707
[Jim] Now there's just
a lot of confusion.

1981
01:23:31.807 --> 01:23:34.510
And Taylor is gonna
have to take a timeout.

1982
01:23:34.610 --> 01:23:36.479
It's been a
back-and-forth battle

1983
01:23:36.579 --> 01:23:38.847
between these phenomenal teams.

1984
01:23:38.947 --> 01:23:40.849
And despite Fisher
getting more minutes.

1985
01:23:40.949 --> 01:23:43.786
Bobby Coleman has managed
to get within 10 yards

1986
01:23:43.886 --> 01:23:45.788
of that rushing record.

1987
01:23:45.888 --> 01:23:47.190
[Tony] Well. Comeback
Coleman has had

1988
01:23:47.290 --> 01:23:48.891
an unbelievable season.

1989
01:23:48.991 --> 01:23:52.428
But Anderson Fisher. he seems
to be more reliable right now.

1990
01:23:52.528 --> 01:23:55.298
[digital beeping]

1991
01:23:56.999 --> 01:23:58.867
42!

1992
01:23:58.967 --> 01:24:00.236
Time out!

1993
01:24:00.336 --> 01:24:01.437
[whistle blowing]

1994
01:24:01.537 --> 01:24:03.239
Zeros and ones.

1995
01:24:03.339 --> 01:24:05.141
-What?
-I've got it!

1996
01:24:05.241 --> 01:24:09.612
So analyzing football plays is
a lot like coding in Python.

1997
01:24:09.712 --> 01:24:11.747
Yeah. yeah. I'm not following.

1998
01:24:11.847 --> 01:24:13.816
The patterns are finite.
So if you gather enough data.

1999
01:24:13.916 --> 01:24:15.451
you can get a sense
of which plays

2000
01:24:15.551 --> 01:24:17.353
are more or less
efficient against others.

2001
01:24:17.453 --> 01:24:19.088
And based on my predictive
analytics. I mean.

2002
01:24:19.188 --> 01:24:20.456
the defense--

2003
01:24:20.556 --> 01:24:24.560
Wait. wait. wait. don't tell us.
Go tell them.

2004
01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:26.095
Who?
The players on the field?

2005
01:24:26.195 --> 01:24:27.530
-Yeah.
-Do it.

2006
01:24:27.630 --> 01:24:28.431
Yeah.

2007
01:24:28.531 --> 01:24:29.665
Come on. guys. that's insane.

2008
01:24:29.765 --> 01:24:32.168
What am I gonna do?
Hop over the divider?

2009
01:24:32.268 --> 01:24:33.702
-Yeah.
-[Margo] I would.

2010
01:24:33.802 --> 01:24:35.904
There's a security guard
right over there.

2011
01:24:37.373 --> 01:24:38.841
All right. we need
a distraction.

2012
01:24:38.941 --> 01:24:40.809
Just tell me the plan and
I'm ready to execute it.

2013
01:24:42.811 --> 01:24:46.382
* Ave

2014
01:24:46.482 --> 01:24:52.555
* Maria

2015
01:24:55.358 --> 01:25:01.330
* Gratia plena

2016
01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:06.101
-His voice!
-It's...beautiful.

2017
01:25:06.202 --> 01:25:07.870
Callie. Callie. look!

2018
01:25:07.970 --> 01:25:11.207
* Gratia plena

2019
01:25:11.307 --> 01:25:12.908
-It's actually working.
-Yeah.

2020
01:25:13.008 --> 01:25:18.714
* Maria. gratia plena

2021
01:25:18.814 --> 01:25:21.384
That's your cue.
Go. go. go.

2022
01:25:22.485 --> 01:25:24.086
Where is she going?

2023
01:25:24.187 --> 01:25:28.056
I've known him for 10 years and
I have never seen him do that.

2024
01:25:28.157 --> 01:25:32.361
* Dominus tecum

2025
01:25:32.461 --> 01:25:38.501
* Bendicta tu in mulieribus

2026
01:25:39.402 --> 01:25:45.241
* Et benedictus

2027
01:25:46.074 --> 01:25:52.047
* Et benedictus
fructus ventris *

2028
01:25:53.148 --> 01:25:55.518
* Ventris tui

2029
01:25:55.618 --> 01:25:57.286
Hey. trust me. Dad. I got
the play you need to run.

2030
01:25:57.386 --> 01:25:59.688
-Callie. what are you doing?
-[Callie] I got this. Trust me.

2031
01:25:59.788 --> 01:26:02.391
Over the past two years. I've
developed an analytics algorithm

2032
01:26:02.491 --> 01:26:04.327
that can determine
the most likely outcome

2033
01:26:04.427 --> 01:26:05.761
of various strategies.

2034
01:26:05.861 --> 01:26:08.731
Long story short.
you do what I tell you.

2035
01:26:08.831 --> 01:26:10.299
you're going to the Super Bowl.

2036
01:26:10.399 --> 01:26:11.934
White board!

2037
01:26:13.001 --> 01:26:14.136
I would listen. Coach.

2038
01:26:14.237 --> 01:26:15.704
You're not really gonna
do that. though. right?

2039
01:26:17.473 --> 01:26:18.941
Let's hear her out.

2040
01:26:19.041 --> 01:26:20.843
Coach?
White board.

2041
01:26:21.877 --> 01:26:23.946
Here you go.

2042
01:26:24.046 --> 01:26:26.014
Huddle up.

2043
01:26:26.982 --> 01:26:28.651
* Can't stop this power.
this flaunt. this pose *

2044
01:26:28.751 --> 01:26:30.519
* This strut. this
look. this style *

2045
01:26:30.619 --> 01:26:32.421
* Come around me.
might get too hot *

2046
01:26:32.521 --> 01:26:34.690
* You go in. but I go out

2047
01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:36.892
* Boss. boss. boss.
boss. boss. boss. boss *

2048
01:26:38.627 --> 01:26:41.096
Dad. Save story time for later!

2049
01:26:41.196 --> 01:26:43.799
Yes. ma'am.

2050
01:26:43.899 --> 01:26:44.700
That's it.

2051
01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:46.269
You guys run it like I laid out.

2052
01:26:46.369 --> 01:26:49.104
my dad's got a 92% chance of
scoring the winning touchdown.

2053
01:26:49.204 --> 01:26:50.973
Okay.

2054
01:26:51.874 --> 01:26:56.845
Gentlemen...this might
cost me my job. but...

2055
01:26:56.945 --> 01:27:00.182
this is a smart play.
We're gonna go with it.

2056
01:27:00.283 --> 01:27:01.784
Game!

2057
01:27:01.884 --> 01:27:03.919
Win on three.
One. two. three--

2058
01:27:04.019 --> 01:27:05.588
[Huddle] Win!

2059
01:27:05.688 --> 01:27:09.258
-Hey. you must lock the middle.
-You got it. Coach.

2060
01:27:12.828 --> 01:27:14.830
This works. you're gonna
get the rushing record.

2061
01:27:14.930 --> 01:27:16.499
Yeah. but without Madden--

2062
01:27:16.599 --> 01:27:20.569
Dad. Dad. you don't need Madden.
You never did.

2063
01:27:22.104 --> 01:27:24.940
[Jim] Strap in. folks!
Here we go!

2064
01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:26.575
Tony?

2065
01:27:26.675 --> 01:27:28.010
[Tony] And Coleman and
Fisher are both on the field

2066
01:27:28.110 --> 01:27:31.013
at the same time in
an unconventional move

2067
01:27:31.113 --> 01:27:33.015
through the final play
to go to the Super Bowl.

2068
01:27:33.115 --> 01:27:35.518
[Jim] There is no more
tense moment than this.

2069
01:27:35.618 --> 01:27:38.287
The entire season. the
trip to the Super Bowl

2070
01:27:38.387 --> 01:27:40.255
on the line right here.

2071
01:27:40.356 --> 01:27:42.124
[Tony] With both of them on
the field at the same time.

2072
01:27:42.224 --> 01:27:44.660
I'm thinking for
something kind of tricky.

2073
01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:46.161
[Jim] Oh. it is tricky.

2074
01:27:46.261 --> 01:27:47.696
It's a direct step to Coleman.

2075
01:27:47.796 --> 01:27:50.966
Around the right side.
he's looking for a gap.

2076
01:27:51.066 --> 01:27:53.736
Go. go. go!

2077
01:27:55.871 --> 01:27:57.606
[Tony] Matthias has broken free.

2078
01:27:57.706 --> 01:27:59.508
He's coming up to
make the tackle.

2079
01:27:59.608 --> 01:28:01.143
[Jim] But look at this!

2080
01:28:01.243 --> 01:28:04.347
Coleman's gonna go across
the field with a lateral.

2081
01:28:04.447 --> 01:28:06.281
He's got Fisher!

2082
01:28:06.382 --> 01:28:09.017
Wait!

2083
01:28:09.117 --> 01:28:10.285
[Jim] On the feet!

2084
01:28:10.386 --> 01:28:13.288
And Anderson Fisher is in!

2085
01:28:13.389 --> 01:28:17.025
The Falcons have won it in
the most improbable of ways!

2086
01:28:17.125 --> 01:28:20.996
And Atlanta is heading
to the Super Bowl!

2087
01:28:21.096 --> 01:28:23.966
[Tony] Bobby Coleman had a
chance at the rushing record

2088
01:28:24.066 --> 01:28:28.070
and chose to get his
team to the Super Bowl.

2089
01:28:28.170 --> 01:28:31.574
That gave me goosebumps
right there. Jim.

2090
01:28:31.674 --> 01:28:35.210
[cheering. grunting]

2091
01:28:39.482 --> 01:28:40.649
Coleman!

2092
01:28:41.984 --> 01:28:43.218
Aah!

2093
01:28:43.318 --> 01:28:46.789
You weren't kidding!
You're a great hugger.

2094
01:28:46.889 --> 01:28:48.924
-It's a heck of a play!
-Yeah.

2095
01:28:49.024 --> 01:28:50.192
You could've beat
my rushing record.

2096
01:28:50.292 --> 01:28:52.227
but you put the team first.

2097
01:28:52.327 --> 01:28:54.096
Look. don't tell nobody but. uh.

2098
01:28:54.196 --> 01:28:55.864
you might be my
favorite player again.

2099
01:28:55.964 --> 01:28:57.299
[laughs]

2100
01:28:59.067 --> 01:29:00.235
Oh. hey!

2101
01:29:00.335 --> 01:29:02.671
Anderson.

2102
01:29:02.771 --> 01:29:04.673
You was right about everything.

2103
01:29:06.475 --> 01:29:09.612
Or...were you?

2104
01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:13.549
[crowd cheering]

2105
01:29:13.649 --> 01:29:15.451
[laughs]

2106
01:29:15.551 --> 01:29:17.920
Uh-uh.

2107
01:29:18.020 --> 01:29:19.688
Coleman!

2108
01:29:19.788 --> 01:29:21.424
Coleman. you can't
leave me like that!

2109
01:29:21.524 --> 01:29:24.693
It was the game.
It was the game!

2110
01:29:24.793 --> 01:29:29.197
[cheering. shouting]

2111
01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:32.735
Yes!

2112
01:29:32.835 --> 01:29:34.002
Okay. now.
that was pretty much

2113
01:29:34.102 --> 01:29:35.170
the coolest thing
I've ever seen.

2114
01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:36.739
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

2115
01:29:36.839 --> 01:29:39.875
[fireworks whistle and burst]

2116
01:29:41.944 --> 01:29:43.779
Um. hey. in case
you were wondering.

2117
01:29:43.879 --> 01:29:46.715
now would be. like.
the perfect time to kiss me.

2118
01:29:51.654 --> 01:29:53.589
Yes! Yes. yes. I knew it!

2119
01:29:53.689 --> 01:29:59.394
[Callie] Yeah...it was a weird
year. but also kind of the best.

2120
01:29:59.495 --> 01:30:04.266
We ended up getting second
place at the robotics nationals.

2121
01:30:04.366 --> 01:30:06.334
My dad signed a multiyear
deal with the Falcons

2122
01:30:06.435 --> 01:30:07.936
after winning the Super Bowl.

2123
01:30:08.036 --> 01:30:10.205
What's up. Coach?
Not you--other coach.

2124
01:30:10.305 --> 01:30:12.374
[Callie] And I landed a
pretty sweet internship

2125
01:30:12.475 --> 01:30:14.142
doing analytics
for the Falcons.

2126
01:30:14.242 --> 01:30:15.944
My parents have
never been prouder.

2127
01:30:16.044 --> 01:30:17.813
That's right. Callie. you
talk about those numbers!

2128
01:30:17.913 --> 01:30:21.149
-This is it!
-Thank you!

2129
01:30:21.249 --> 01:30:22.651
Or louder .

2130
01:30:22.751 --> 01:30:24.086
Okay...

2131
01:30:24.186 --> 01:30:27.623
[Callie] And this year
for my birthday...

2132
01:30:27.723 --> 01:30:30.959
all my wishes
actually came true.

2133
01:30:31.059 --> 01:30:34.663
For once. there were no
moving boxes in sight.

2134
01:30:34.763 --> 01:30:37.065
Just an actual group of
friends to call my own

2135
01:30:37.165 --> 01:30:40.536
in a city that's starting
to feel like home.

2136
01:30:40.636 --> 01:30:43.772
And I think maybe a boyfriend?

2137
01:30:43.872 --> 01:30:45.641
-Happy birthday. Callie.
-Thank you.

2138
01:30:45.741 --> 01:30:47.142
-Can I get one of those?
-Yes.

2139
01:30:47.242 --> 01:30:48.410
All right. Drake.

2140
01:30:48.511 --> 01:30:50.479
Why don't you move that arm
while you still got one?

2141
01:30:50.579 --> 01:30:52.214
-Dad...
-I'm sorry. Mr. Coleman.

2142
01:30:52.314 --> 01:30:54.382
-You know we--
-Oh. hey. hey. hey.

2143
01:30:54.483 --> 01:30:55.684
We got a big surprise outside.

2144
01:30:55.784 --> 01:30:57.686
Come on. let's go.
everybody outside now.

2145
01:30:57.786 --> 01:30:59.387
Come on!

2146
01:31:06.795 --> 01:31:10.866
* I can feel the
beat in my body *

2147
01:31:10.966 --> 01:31:15.170
* I can feel the rhythm
down to my toes. yeah *

2148
01:31:17.740 --> 01:31:20.242
-Surprise!
-[laughs]

2149
01:31:20.342 --> 01:31:24.112
No way. no freakin' way!

2150
01:31:24.212 --> 01:31:26.949
-It's all yours.
-Oh my god!

2151
01:31:27.049 --> 01:31:28.951
-Okay. who wants a ride?
-Oh. I got the front!

2152
01:31:29.051 --> 01:31:31.820
Hey. hey! Have at it!

2153
01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:35.457
Oh. my goodness.

* All right. don't
stop for fools *

2158
01:31:54.476 --> 01:31:58.380
[Callie] Yep. I'd say Atlanta's
the perfect place for us.

2159
01:31:58.480 --> 01:31:59.381
