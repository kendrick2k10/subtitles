- Got it.

13
00:01:04.586 --> 00:01:06.241
- I'm so happy that all the kids

14
00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:07.172
are coming home for
Christmas this year.

15
00:01:07.206 --> 00:01:09.689
- Yeah. Yeah.

16
00:01:09.724 --> 00:01:11.724
- What?

17
00:01:11.758 --> 00:01:13.068
- It is just that we're
gonna have a lot of loud folk

18
00:01:13.103 --> 00:01:15.103
in our house and now.

19
00:01:15.137 --> 00:01:17.724
now we can't even walk around
naked for the holidays.

20
00:01:17.758 --> 00:01:19.172
- Well. we have never done that.

21
00:01:19.206 --> 00:01:20.655
- Well. it's on my bucket list.

22
00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:22.551
- Ew!
- What you mean. ew?

23
00:01:22.586 --> 00:01:23.724
- I don't wanna see that.

00:01:23.758 --> 00:01:25.724
- You done seen it. You like it.

25
00:01:26.896 --> 00:01:29.103
- Have you talked to the kids?

26
00:01:29.137 --> 00:01:31.344
I'm just worried that Chris
and Trina and the twins

27
00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:32.793
won't come because
he's mad at Todd.

28
00:01:32.827 --> 00:01:34.793

Huh?

- Don't call him
that. He eccentric.

32
00:01:39.103 --> 00:01:40.448
- He's a quack.

33
00:01:40.482 --> 00:01:41.689
- Yes. He'll be here too.

Oh. sugar sugar now.

- Bryan. do you think
this tree is crooked?

52
00:02:31.896 --> 00:02:34.172
- No? No. I don't think so.

53
00:02:34.206 --> 00:02:38.620
Yeah. Maybe a couple more
ornaments on the left side.

54
00:02:38.655 --> 00:02:40.517
I'll tell you what.
I'll get the box

55
00:02:40.551 --> 00:02:42.137
I hid in the office closet.

56
00:02:43.482 --> 00:02:44.620
I didn't think you'd notice.

57
00:02:45.793 --> 00:02:47.758
What. what?

58
00:02:47.793 --> 00:02:49.586
It's a lot of work
hanging all those things.

59
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.896
- So we hiding things now?

60
00:02:50.931 --> 00:02:52.620
- No. I'm not hiding anything.

61
00:02:52.655 --> 00:02:55.758
I'm. I'm just gonna get the box.

62
00:02:55.793 --> 00:02:57.137
- Thank you big papa.

63
00:02:57.172 --> 00:02:58.931
- You welcome. mama.

64
00:02:58.965 --> 00:03:00.620
- I knew I wasn't crazy.

65
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.586
[phone ringing]

66
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.862
- Hey dad. How
you doing old man?

67
00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:09.206
- I'm. I'm good. I'm good.

68
00:03:09.241 --> 00:03:12.793
Listen. I can't talk very long.

69
00:03:12.827 --> 00:03:15.517
I really need you to
do something for me.

70
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:17.724
- Of course. What is it. Dad?

71
00:03:17.758 --> 00:03:20.793
- Sweetheart. I need
this to be between us.

72
00:03:20.827 --> 00:03:22.896
- What is it?

73
00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:25.379
- Cydney. I know you. Can
you keep your mouth shut?

74
00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:27.689
- You know I will.
Now. what is it. Dad?

75
00:03:27.724 --> 00:03:28.620
- [Sylvia] Bryan!

76
00:03:30.241 --> 00:03:30.758
- Yes. dear!

77
00:03:32.034 --> 00:03:33.620
I gotta go. I'll call you back.

78
00:03:33.655 --> 00:03:35.965
[curious music]

79
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.827
[phone ringing]

80
00:03:42.862 --> 00:03:44.206
- Hey. Cyd. What's
up. little sister?

81
00:03:44.241 --> 00:03:46.448
- Hey you. Have you
spoken to dad lately?

82
00:03:46.482 --> 00:03:48.379
- Yeah. I spoke to him
earlier today. Why?

83
00:03:48.413 --> 00:03:50.310
- [Cydney] He's acting weird.

84
00:03:50.344 --> 00:03:51.862
Some secret. but he had to
go before he could share.

85
00:03:51.896 --> 00:03:53.551
- And you're sharing it already.

86
00:03:54.724 --> 00:03:56.862
Damn. Cyd. You can't hold water.

87
00:03:56.896 --> 00:03:58.793
- Whatever. Chris.
Dad's a senior citizen.

88
00:03:58.827 --> 00:04:00.896
He ain't supposed to
be keeping secrets.

89
00:04:01.965 --> 00:04:03.793
- I'm sure you'll figure it out.

90
00:04:03.827 --> 00:04:05.931
I'm already dealing with
some other family mess.

91
00:04:05.965 --> 00:04:07.724
- [Cydney] Oh. what
did the twins do?

92
00:04:07.758 --> 00:04:08.931
- It's not the twins.

93
00:04:08.965 --> 00:04:09.931
- Trina?

94
00:04:09.965 --> 00:04:11.517
- No.

95
00:04:11.551 --> 00:04:12.931
- [Cydney] Then
what's the problem?

96
00:04:12.965 --> 00:04:13.896
- Your dumbass brother.

97
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.551
- Duh. I have two.

98
00:04:17.586 --> 00:04:19.413
What did Todd do now?

99
00:04:19.448 --> 00:04:21.448
- Oh nothing. Just another
bad business decision.

100
00:04:21.482 --> 00:04:23.758
You know. I don't know why I
went into business with him.

101
00:04:23.793 --> 00:04:25.862
- Stop whining.

102
00:04:25.896 --> 00:04:27.344
You guys need to work on
your communication skills.

103
00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:28.896
- Yeah that will work
with someone reasonable.

104
00:04:28.931 --> 00:04:30.000
not some impulsive act.

105
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.793
You know what? I gotta go.

106
00:04:33.827 --> 00:04:35.724
- Oh. okay. I'll see you
at mom and dad's later?

107
00:04:35.758 --> 00:04:36.758
- Maybe.

108
00:04:36.793 --> 00:04:37.655
I love you. sis.

109
00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:38.344
- Maybe?

110
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.862
- Hey!

111
00:04:45.793 --> 00:04:48.586
Hey. Mr. Elkins.

112
00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.517
What's going on. man?

113
00:04:50.551 --> 00:04:53.413
How you doing? Why we gotta
go through this every year?

114
00:04:53.448 --> 00:04:53.931
You know me.

115
00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:56.689
I'll slide you a VA check.

116
00:04:59.448 --> 00:05:00.344
Come on. man.

117
00:05:05.931 --> 00:05:07.068
- Good morning to you too.

118
00:05:11.137 --> 00:05:12.034
- Chris.

119
00:05:13.413 --> 00:05:15.034
Can you hear me?

120
00:05:15.068 --> 00:05:16.448
- I can hear you.
babe. How are you?

121
00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:17.034
- I'm good.

122
00:05:18.965 --> 00:05:20.000
I talked to Mama
Sylvia this afternoon

123
00:05:20.034 --> 00:05:21.413
about the Christmas plans.

124
00:05:21.448 --> 00:05:23.000
- Here we go.

125
00:05:23.034 --> 00:05:25.965
- Chris. I really think
that we should go.

126
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.413
- See if we go. I
can't promise you

127
00:05:27.448 --> 00:05:29.344
I won't try to kill Todd.

128
00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:32.758
Look. let's stay home and
have a small chill Christmas.

129
00:05:32.793 --> 00:05:34.344
- Come on. babe.

130
00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:36.034
We cannot not go to
your parents this year.

131
00:05:36.068 --> 00:05:38.068
It's traditions.

132
00:05:38.103 --> 00:05:39.724
- Babe. The twins are
going to college next year.

133
00:05:39.758 --> 00:05:41.896
What do we do if this fails?

134
00:05:41.931 --> 00:05:43.482
- I hear you. but.

135
00:05:43.517 --> 00:05:45.827
- Trina. Todd lost a
half a million dollars.

136
00:05:45.862 --> 00:05:47.413
- Wait. what?

137
00:05:48.827 --> 00:05:50.000
A half a million dollars?

138
00:05:51.965 --> 00:05:53.586
I didn't. I didn't know
that it was that much.

139
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.827
- Yes. all of our
company reserves.

140
00:05:55.862 --> 00:05:57.482
- Well. can you
get the money back?

141
00:05:57.517 --> 00:05:59.103
- Look. I don't know.

142
00:05:59.137 --> 00:06:01.896
I mean. it leaves us with
little to no operating capital.

143
00:06:02.758 --> 00:06:03.827
All over an app.

144
00:06:03.862 --> 00:06:04.517
- An app?

145
00:06:07.034 --> 00:06:08.689
Is there anything
that you can do?

146
00:06:08.724 --> 00:06:10.103
- I'm looking into it.

147
00:06:10.137 --> 00:06:11.689
And that's why I think
we should just stay home

148
00:06:11.724 --> 00:06:13.034
and have a nice quiet Christmas.

149
00:06:13.068 --> 00:06:14.896
Just me. you and the girls.

150
00:06:16.517 --> 00:06:18.000
I'm tired of-

151
00:06:18.034 --> 00:06:19.448
- Hey. hey. hey.

152
00:06:19.482 --> 00:06:20.137
It's okay.

153
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.000
[sighing]
Just come home. okay?

154
00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.965
- All right. babe.
I'll see you soon.

155
00:06:37.448 --> 00:06:39.896
- Yo. Janelle. you
really leaving me?

156
00:06:39.931 --> 00:06:41.896
Baby. are you serious?

157
00:06:41.931 --> 00:06:43.379
I told you this was temporary.

158
00:06:45.206 --> 00:06:47.137
Look. baby. What I'm trying
to build is gonna be big.

159
00:06:47.172 --> 00:06:49.931
- Baby boy. I gave
you three years.

160
00:06:49.965 --> 00:06:52.000
And what do we have
to show for? Nothing.

161
00:06:53.965 --> 00:06:55.172
- Now. baby what
about last night?

162
00:06:55.206 --> 00:06:57.586
- That's never been
the problem. Todd.

163
00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.689
The problem is I'm tired.

164
00:06:59.724 --> 00:07:01.931
I'm still here. and you're
still what. chasing dreams?

165
00:07:01.965 --> 00:07:04.068
- Baby. I'm chasing
dreams for us.

166
00:07:04.103 --> 00:07:05.206
Look. what I'm trying to build

167
00:07:05.241 --> 00:07:06.172
is gonna take us over the top.

168
00:07:06.206 --> 00:07:08.517
- Really?

169
00:07:08.551 --> 00:07:10.103
Todd. you said that about
the last two investments.

170
00:07:10.137 --> 00:07:11.551
They failed.

171
00:07:11.586 --> 00:07:12.896
They all failed.

172
00:07:12.931 --> 00:07:14.034
- That was during the pandemic.

173
00:07:14.068 --> 00:07:15.172
What do you want me to do. babe?

174
00:07:15.206 --> 00:07:16.482
Wait. Hey. look at me.

175
00:07:16.517 --> 00:07:17.103
Listen. I got you.

176
00:07:20.275 --> 00:07:22.172
Just stick it out with me
just a little bit longer

177
00:07:22.206 --> 00:07:23.793
and I promise you I got you.

178
00:07:23.827 --> 00:07:24.482
Please.

179
00:07:26.172 --> 00:07:27.965
- Todd. I need more
than just. "I got you."

180
00:07:29.896 --> 00:07:32.000
We're just not evenly yolked.

181
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.034
- Do you mean equally yolked?

182
00:07:36.068 --> 00:07:39.034
- Whatever. you get the
point. We don't fit anymore.

183
00:07:39.068 --> 00:07:41.551
Look. look at me.

184
00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:43.034
I'm sorry. but...

185
00:07:45.689 --> 00:07:47.000
I think this is for the best.

186
00:07:49.172 --> 00:07:50.482
You'll always have a
special place in my heart.

187
00:07:51.758 --> 00:07:54.000
Just not in my life anymore.

188
00:07:55.068 --> 00:07:55.965
I'm sorry.

189
00:08:00.034 --> 00:08:01.965
I'll send for the rest
of my things. Okay?

190
00:08:03.206 --> 00:08:06.034
[poignant music]

191
00:08:06.068 --> 00:08:06.965
Merry Christmas.

192
00:08:15.103 --> 00:08:18.034
[door slamming]

193
00:08:18.068 --> 00:08:20.655
[phone ringing]

194
00:08:22.689 --> 00:08:23.896
- Not right now. Cydney.

195
00:08:27.068 --> 00:08:30.241
- Of course I enjoy spending
time with you. Jefferson.

196
00:08:30.275 --> 00:08:32.172
- [Jefferson] What am I
supposed to? I can't tell.

197
00:08:32.206 --> 00:08:34.206
I mean. you going
away for the holidays

198
00:08:34.241 --> 00:08:36.931
and you know I want to
spend the holidays with you.

199
00:08:36.965 --> 00:08:37.931
I'm gonna miss you.

200
00:08:37.965 --> 00:08:40.172
- Aw. Jefferson. I know.

201
00:08:40.206 --> 00:08:42.275
I'm gonna miss you
too over the holidays.

202
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:44.793
But I told you I have to
spend time with my family.

203
00:08:44.827 --> 00:08:46.724
It's our tradition.
I have to go home.

204
00:08:46.758 --> 00:08:47.931
- No. I know.

205
00:08:47.965 --> 00:08:50.655
It's just. Cyd.

206
00:08:52.758 --> 00:08:54.793
I think I'm falling
in love with you.

207
00:08:54.827 --> 00:08:56.620
[phone vibrating]

208
00:08:56.655 --> 00:08:59.103
- Oh. What was that. Jeff?

209
00:08:59.137 --> 00:09:00.241
Oh wait. hold on a second.

210
00:09:01.689 --> 00:09:02.862
Hello?

211
00:09:02.896 --> 00:09:04.620
- Hey. beautiful.

212
00:09:04.655 --> 00:09:05.931
How you feeling?

213
00:09:05.965 --> 00:09:07.793
- I'm fine. Omar. How are you?

214
00:09:07.827 --> 00:09:09.172
- Not as half as
fine as you girl.

215
00:09:11.137 --> 00:09:12.379
Which is why I want to
come see you this week

216
00:09:12.413 --> 00:09:14.620
and do some of
this holiday shit.

217
00:09:15.793 --> 00:09:17.206
You'll be in DC right?

218
00:09:17.241 --> 00:09:19.344
- Yes. but you know
I have to spend time

219
00:09:19.379 --> 00:09:21.620
with my family for Christmas.

220
00:09:21.655 --> 00:09:23.344
Look. we'll catch up soon.

221
00:09:23.379 --> 00:09:25.137
- Oh. come on.

222
00:09:25.172 --> 00:09:27.172
You say that like
you didn't enjoy

223
00:09:27.206 --> 00:09:29.275
when we caught up the last time.

224
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:31.344
- Oh. hey Omar. I gotta
go. I have company.

225
00:09:31.379 --> 00:09:32.862
Merry Christmas.

226
00:09:32.896 --> 00:09:34.620
Hey. Jeff?
- [Jefferson] Hello?

227
00:09:34.655 --> 00:09:36.068
- Yeah. I gotta go.
Merry Christmas!

228
00:09:38.379 --> 00:09:39.793
Hey. girl. What's up?

229
00:09:39.827 --> 00:09:41.344
- Look. I need a break.

230
00:09:41.379 --> 00:09:43.310
And from the sound
of your calls.

231
00:09:43.344 --> 00:09:45.620
sound like you need a break too.

232
00:09:45.655 --> 00:09:47.241
- I just don't
understand these men.

233
00:09:47.275 --> 00:09:49.344
Don't push me for more
if I'm not pushing you.

234
00:09:50.896 --> 00:09:53.931
- Cyd. You are a
real pimp. girl.

235
00:09:53.965 --> 00:09:56.034
Geez.
- I'm not a pimp.

236
00:09:56.068 --> 00:09:57.689
I'm just clear.

237
00:09:57.724 --> 00:09:59.344
I have a way I like to move.

238
00:09:59.379 --> 00:10:01.862
And until I'm ready to
settle down. I'm cool.

239
00:10:01.896 --> 00:10:04.379
I will enjoy my friends
until my man comes in.

240
00:10:04.413 --> 00:10:06.275
- Oh. Okay.

241
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:08.620
And you have a starting five.
- That's right.

242
00:10:08.655 --> 00:10:10.620
And each one plays a
different position in my life.

243
00:10:10.655 --> 00:10:11.793
- Girl.
[laughing]

244
00:10:11.827 --> 00:10:12.931
- Look. don't judge me. Ryan.

245
00:10:12.965 --> 00:10:14.137
I'm clear with all of them.

246
00:10:15.965 --> 00:10:16.793
Mostly.

247
00:10:16.827 --> 00:10:18.034
- [Ryan] Hmm.

248
00:10:18.068 --> 00:10:19.172
Mostly.

249
00:10:19.206 --> 00:10:20.206
- So you still going to Jamaica?

250
00:10:23.241 --> 00:10:25.724
- Well. it's not Jamaica.

251
00:10:25.758 --> 00:10:26.862
It's St. Thomas.

252
00:10:26.896 --> 00:10:28.620
- Ooh. Christmas in St. Thomas.

253
00:10:28.655 --> 00:10:30.034
Nice.

254
00:10:30.068 --> 00:10:31.103
- Would be nice

255
00:10:32.758 --> 00:10:35.241
if he would just find
his passport in time.

256
00:10:35.275 --> 00:10:37.793
He said he lost
it earlier today.

257
00:10:37.827 --> 00:10:40.172
- You don't need a
passport for St. Thomas.

258
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:43.379
- Oh?

259
00:10:43.413 --> 00:10:46.068
Let me just...

260
00:10:56.275 --> 00:10:57.344
- Hey hun.

261
00:10:57.379 --> 00:11:00.965
So what are we gonna do?

262
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.448
- [Victor] It's too
late to get a new one.

263
00:11:02.482 --> 00:11:04.310
- Dang.

264
00:11:04.344 --> 00:11:07.758
Well. we can always
stay here together.

265
00:11:07.793 --> 00:11:11.275
Or we can go to Cydney's family
house in DC for the holiday.

266
00:11:13.482 --> 00:11:15.137
- [Victor] I was thinking of
driving to Ohio to my brothers.

267
00:11:15.172 --> 00:11:16.965
- Oh. okay.

268
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.241
So when do we leave?

269
00:11:19.862 --> 00:11:21.758
- [Victor] I was gonna
go up with my sister.

270
00:11:21.793 --> 00:11:23.310
- Your sister?

271
00:11:23.344 --> 00:11:25.758
I didn't even realize
you had a sister.

272
00:11:25.793 --> 00:11:27.413
- [Victor] Got an idea.

273
00:11:27.448 --> 00:11:30.310
You go to Cyd's parents
and I'll go to my sister's.

274
00:11:30.344 --> 00:11:33.103
I mean. my brother's
with my sister.

275
00:11:33.137 --> 00:11:35.137
Maybe we can hook
up on New Year.

276
00:11:35.172 --> 00:11:37.137
- You know what? I
see what this is.

277
00:11:37.172 --> 00:11:38.758
Just have a good time.

278
00:11:38.793 --> 00:11:40.758
- [Victor] There you
go. Let me keep looking.

279
00:11:40.793 --> 00:11:41.758
Damn. woman.

280
00:11:41.793 --> 00:11:42.310
- Okay. But just re-

281
00:11:46.103 --> 00:11:47.137
Do not start. Cyd.

282
00:11:51.344 --> 00:11:53.965
- I'm gonna send you my
parents' address. just in case.

283
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.172
And I'll head out later.

284
00:11:56.724 --> 00:11:59.000
- Thanks girl. I
really appreciate it.

285
00:11:59.034 --> 00:12:00.206
- [Cydney] Mhmm.

286
00:12:00.241 --> 00:12:01.206
- I hope I don't need it.

287
00:12:03.068 --> 00:12:05.275
[piano music]

288
00:12:33.896 --> 00:12:35.827
[sighing]

289
00:12:37.068 --> 00:12:38.482
- Oh wait.

290
00:12:38.517 --> 00:12:40.034
- That's ugly. I
would not wear that.

291
00:12:40.068 --> 00:12:42.379
- I would.
- I like this one.

292
00:12:42.413 --> 00:12:44.137
- But it's-
- But that's not my color.

293
00:12:44.172 --> 00:12:49.172
I feel like that color. mm. No.

294
00:12:50.551 --> 00:12:51.862
- Hey girls. can
you do me a favor?

295
00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:53.000
- Yeah sure. Mom. What's up?

296
00:12:53.034 --> 00:12:54.379
- I got a migraine coming on.

297
00:12:54.413 --> 00:12:55.275
Can you finish up
the kitchen from me?

298
00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:56.379
- Sure. Mom.

299
00:12:56.413 --> 00:12:57.379
- Sure. Mom. like for real?

300
00:12:57.413 --> 00:12:58.137
For real. sure Mom?

301
00:12:58.172 --> 00:12:59.758
- Yes.

302
00:12:59.793 --> 00:13:01.000
- [Trina] Like you're
not gonna talk about me

303
00:13:01.034 --> 00:13:01.827
and call me the evil stepmom?

304
00:13:01.862 --> 00:13:01.896
- [Twins] No!

305
00:13:02.965 --> 00:13:03.931
All right. Thank you.

306
00:13:03.965 --> 00:13:04.586
Put it on my tab.

307
00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:05.448
- Okay.

308
00:13:10.448 --> 00:13:13.586
So Taryn. tonight
we're straight. right?

309
00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:16.310
- Ken. why do you
always do this to me?

310
00:13:16.344 --> 00:13:17.931
You know they'll kill
us if they come in there

311
00:13:17.965 --> 00:13:19.827
and you're gone.

312
00:13:19.862 --> 00:13:21.931
- Taryn. come on. Malcolm
is going away for Christmas.

313
00:13:21.965 --> 00:13:24.862
We won't see each
other for like 10 days.

314
00:13:24.896 --> 00:13:27.206
I mean. I know it's a
risk. but if they catch us.

315
00:13:27.241 --> 00:13:28.275
I'll just take all the blame.

316
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:30.413
- You always say that.

317
00:13:30.448 --> 00:13:31.896
Then I always found myself
on punishment with you.

318
00:13:31.931 --> 00:13:33.896
- I won't get caught.

319
00:13:33.931 --> 00:13:36.344
Besides. I just told
you. 10 whole days.

320
00:13:39.034 --> 00:13:41.448
Also. I need you to style me.

321
00:13:41.482 --> 00:13:44.000
- Ken. I don't even know
why you're so pressed.

322
00:13:44.034 --> 00:13:46.586
I don't see Malcolm trying
to plan to come see you.

323
00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:49.413
- Taryn. this is the only
Christmas gift I want from you.

324
00:13:51.482 --> 00:13:52.931
- Fine.

325
00:13:52.965 --> 00:13:54.275
- Thank you.

326
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:56.103
- Bryan. He's here!

327
00:13:56.137 --> 00:13:58.275
- [Bryan] I'm coming.

328
00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:00.000
- Hey princess!
- Mommy!

329
00:14:00.034 --> 00:14:01.344
- Yo! There she is!

330
00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:05.620
- Hey mom. how are you?

331
00:14:05.655 --> 00:14:07.310
- There's my baby girl.

332
00:14:07.344 --> 00:14:09.103
Oh. my favorite daughter.
- Hey dad.

333
00:14:09.137 --> 00:14:10.896
Dad. I'm your only daughter.

334
00:14:10.931 --> 00:14:13.896
- Oh yeah. that's right.
[laughing]

335
00:14:13.931 --> 00:14:15.620
- Mom.

336
00:14:15.655 --> 00:14:18.344
I was just checking to see
if there was any romance.

337
00:14:18.379 --> 00:14:20.620
- Nothing has changed.

338
00:14:20.655 --> 00:14:23.931
Oh. and it seems nothing has
changed here either. huh?

339
00:14:23.965 --> 00:14:25.310
- Oh. no. No.

340
00:14:25.344 --> 00:14:28.344
He is. he's quite the character.

341
00:14:28.379 --> 00:14:30.413
- I see.
- He's cray-cray.

342
00:14:30.448 --> 00:14:32.034
Are you hungry?

343
00:14:32.068 --> 00:14:33.172
- You know I'm hungry.
- Okay. let's go.

344
00:14:33.206 --> 00:14:33.586
- Oh yeah!
- Bags.

345
00:14:39.931 --> 00:14:42.448
[curious music]

346
00:14:50.965 --> 00:14:52.344
- Excuse me.

347
00:14:52.379 --> 00:14:53.344
You cannot park here.

348
00:14:53.379 --> 00:14:54.517
- What's the problem?

349
00:14:54.551 --> 00:14:56.103
- You're blocking my access.

350
00:14:56.137 --> 00:14:57.482
- Don't you have
better things to do.

351
00:14:57.517 --> 00:14:59.034
like go take a
shower or something?

352
00:14:59.068 --> 00:15:00.241
- Yeah. like having
your car towed.

353
00:15:00.275 --> 00:15:01.965
- You would have more space

354
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.655
if you would move
those damn cones.

355
00:15:03.689 --> 00:15:05.482
- If you don't move your
car. I'm a have it towed.

356
00:15:05.517 --> 00:15:06.517
- Whatever.

357
00:15:06.551 --> 00:15:07.689
- Oh fine. What?

358
00:15:07.724 --> 00:15:08.586
Fine.

359
00:15:14.724 --> 00:15:18.310
- How do y'all live
next to that crazy man?

360
00:15:18.344 --> 00:15:19.965
Cydney?

361
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.172
I had no idea you'd
be here so early.

362
00:15:21.206 --> 00:15:22.206
Honey. how you doing?

363
00:15:22.241 --> 00:15:23.344
- I'm good. Auntie Glo.

364
00:15:23.379 --> 00:15:25.034
And you look fabulous as ever.

365
00:15:25.068 --> 00:15:26.689
- Thank you. baby.

366
00:15:26.724 --> 00:15:28.551
You know. your Aunt Glo
has to keep it together

367
00:15:28.586 --> 00:15:30.275
'cause I am looking
for my next husband.

368
00:15:31.344 --> 00:15:32.689
Who wants a drink?

369
00:15:32.724 --> 00:15:35.586
- It's 10:00 AM. way too early.

370
00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.551
- Well. it's 6:00 PM
somewhere. and guess what?

371
00:15:37.586 --> 00:15:40.275
We're all good and grown and
I'll make enough for everybody.

372
00:15:42.068 --> 00:15:44.344
- You and your husband
were always early drinkers.

373
00:15:44.379 --> 00:15:45.655
Good morning ladies.

374
00:15:45.689 --> 00:15:47.724
- Hey daddy.

375
00:15:47.758 --> 00:15:49.413
- Bloody Mary's in the morning
and Vodka Collins at noon.

376
00:15:50.758 --> 00:15:52.551
So y'all need to do research.

377
00:15:52.586 --> 00:15:55.034
- Research? What are
you talking about?

378
00:15:55.068 --> 00:15:56.965
Now. I'm a retired physician.

379
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.482
I never read any research

380
00:15:58.517 --> 00:16:01.482
that promotes consuming
alcoholic beverages

381
00:16:01.517 --> 00:16:02.620
all day. every day.

382
00:16:04.655 --> 00:16:05.586
- Well Bryan. you wouldn't
know nothing about that

383
00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:07.620
'cause you were a pediatrician.

384
00:16:07.655 --> 00:16:09.689
- Eh.
- [Gloria] Anyway.

385
00:16:09.724 --> 00:16:11.793
A cocktail in the morning
activates the neurons

386
00:16:11.827 --> 00:16:13.172
in the gray matter of the brain

387
00:16:13.206 --> 00:16:14.620
that stimulates and invigorates

388
00:16:14.655 --> 00:16:16.655
all thought processes
throughout the day.

389
00:16:18.275 --> 00:16:19.620
- You don't make no sense.

390
00:16:19.655 --> 00:16:21.758
Listen. you still
drive that white Lexus?

391
00:16:21.793 --> 00:16:23.586
- Mhmm.

392
00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:24.724
- I forgot. That's the
reason I came down.

393
00:16:24.758 --> 00:16:26.172
You're about to be towed.

394
00:16:26.206 --> 00:16:27.551
- Oh. hell no.

395
00:16:27.586 --> 00:16:30.103
This man gonna make me kill him.

396
00:16:31.517 --> 00:16:32.655
- It's gonna be a fight.
- I wanna see.

397
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:35.586
- Come on. hook it up.

398
00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.000
Get it outta here.

399
00:16:38.448 --> 00:16:40.482
- Wait!
- Gloria.

400
00:16:40.517 --> 00:16:42.103
Hey. hey. hey.
- Hold on.

401
00:16:42.137 --> 00:16:42.620
- It's okay.

402
00:16:45.275 --> 00:16:46.551
- What's going on?

403
00:16:46.586 --> 00:16:48.172
- Ask him.

404
00:16:48.206 --> 00:16:49.586
Yeah. Mr. Elkins.
Hold on please.

405
00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.586
- I told her if she
did not move it.

406
00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:52.724
I was gonna have it towed.

407
00:16:52.758 --> 00:16:54.034
It was blocking my driveway.

408
00:16:54.068 --> 00:16:55.724
- I'm barely blocking his space.

409
00:16:55.758 --> 00:16:58.068
- Yeah. Glo. you are
blocking his driveway.

410
00:16:58.103 --> 00:16:59.793
- Come on!

411
00:16:59.827 --> 00:17:02.103
- I cannot get my camper
through that little space.

412
00:17:02.137 --> 00:17:03.862
- Ma'am. just move your car a
few inches so we can all go.

413
00:17:03.896 --> 00:17:05.413
- But he can't even move it
anyway. He can't move it.

414
00:17:06.655 --> 00:17:07.620
Come on.

415
00:17:07.655 --> 00:17:09.241
- Please don't. Wait.

416
00:17:09.275 --> 00:17:11.310
No. no. No. no. no.
no. no. no. no. no.

417
00:17:11.344 --> 00:17:13.206
You are such an ass.

418
00:17:13.241 --> 00:17:14.344
You are such an-

419
00:17:14.379 --> 00:17:16.689
- Glo. Glo. Stop. stop. stop.

420
00:17:16.724 --> 00:17:19.068
Okay. all right. Just
go back in the house.

421
00:17:19.103 --> 00:17:21.206
Make me a Bloody
Mary. Please. please.

422
00:17:21.241 --> 00:17:22.241
- You are such an ass!

423
00:17:22.275 --> 00:17:23.827
You're just evil. Evil!

424
00:17:35.172 --> 00:17:36.655
- Well. Cydney. do
you know how to cook?

425
00:17:36.689 --> 00:17:38.448
- Yes. I know how to cook.
- Oh really?

426
00:17:38.482 --> 00:17:40.862
- Mom. I make cereal.

427
00:17:40.896 --> 00:17:42.448
- Cereal?

428
00:17:42.482 --> 00:17:43.551
- [Cyd] Yes. Cereal.

429
00:17:43.586 --> 00:17:44.689
- Oatmeal?

430
00:17:44.724 --> 00:17:45.827
- No. cereal with the milk.

431
00:17:45.862 --> 00:17:47.655
- Oh. child bless your heart.

432
00:17:47.689 --> 00:17:49.241
You haven't taught
her how to cook?

433
00:17:49.275 --> 00:17:50.448
- [Cydney] Yes. I can cook!

434
00:17:50.482 --> 00:17:53.241
- Any luck with sexy and 60?

435
00:17:53.275 --> 00:17:55.137
- Not really.

436
00:17:55.172 --> 00:17:56.724
You know. I think I'm too
much for these old men.

437
00:17:58.724 --> 00:18:00.482
I should go younger.
What y'all think?

438
00:18:02.413 --> 00:18:05.206
These young boys wouldn't
know what to do with all this.

439
00:18:05.241 --> 00:18:06.620
- Hey. son.

440
00:18:06.655 --> 00:18:07.724
- What up. mama? How you doing?

441
00:18:07.758 --> 00:18:08.724
- [Sylvia] I'm good.

442
00:18:08.758 --> 00:18:11.448
- Hi. Good to see you.

443
00:18:11.482 --> 00:18:12.448
- Hi Todd.
- Hey Auntie.

444
00:18:12.482 --> 00:18:14.137
- Good to see you baby.

445
00:18:14.172 --> 00:18:15.103
- Good to see you too.

446
00:18:16.344 --> 00:18:17.482
Sup. Cyd?
- [Cydney] Todd.

447
00:18:18.827 --> 00:18:21.448
- How you doing. son? I
was worried about you.

448
00:18:21.482 --> 00:18:23.379
- I don't know.

449
00:18:23.413 --> 00:18:24.793
I just never expected her
to actually walk out on me.

450
00:18:24.827 --> 00:18:26.793
- You know who you
married. right?

451
00:18:26.827 --> 00:18:28.379
- Look. all marriages
go through something.

452
00:18:28.413 --> 00:18:29.517
but I just. I don't know.

453
00:18:29.551 --> 00:18:31.137
I figured she might stick around

454
00:18:31.172 --> 00:18:32.758
and try and figure
it out with me.

455
00:18:32.793 --> 00:18:34.655
I just can't figure
out where I went wrong.

456
00:18:34.689 --> 00:18:36.862
- Now Todd. I told Sylvia
I never liked that girl.

457
00:18:36.896 --> 00:18:38.620
She had hussy
written all over her.

458
00:18:38.655 --> 00:18:40.655
And then she had the nerves to-

459
00:18:40.689 --> 00:18:42.655
- I know how much you
love Janelle. son.

460
00:18:42.689 --> 00:18:44.931
- Well. I always thought
she was a gold digger.

461
00:18:44.965 --> 00:18:46.620
I told you that as soon
as I met the skank.

462
00:18:46.655 --> 00:18:49.724
- Cydney. your
brother is suffering.

463
00:18:49.758 --> 00:18:51.724
No need to add fuel to the fire.

464
00:18:51.758 --> 00:18:53.310
- You're right.

465
00:18:53.344 --> 00:18:55.413
I just feel so
bad for you. Todd.

466
00:18:55.448 --> 00:18:58.310
That. and Chris being
so pissed off at you.

467
00:18:58.344 --> 00:19:00.482
Do y'all know he may
not come this year?

468
00:19:00.517 --> 00:19:03.310
All because of you and
your shady business moves.

469
00:19:04.551 --> 00:19:05.965
Rough time right now. bruh.

470
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.379
- Yeah. Real rough time.

471
00:19:07.413 --> 00:19:08.793
Hey. speaking of rough time.

472
00:19:08.827 --> 00:19:11.206
how's that music
career of yours going?

473
00:19:11.241 --> 00:19:12.379
Oh. it's not?

474
00:19:12.413 --> 00:19:13.827
Dang. That sucks. man.

475
00:19:13.862 --> 00:19:15.827
I wanted you to
go. That's crazy.

476
00:19:15.862 --> 00:19:16.689
- Shut up.

477
00:19:16.724 --> 00:19:18.310
- You shut up.

478
00:19:18.344 --> 00:19:19.758
- Don't you tell me
what to do to do.

479
00:19:19.793 --> 00:19:20.758
- You can't tell
me to do anything.

480
00:19:20.793 --> 00:19:21.862
Auntie. get her. please.

481
00:19:21.896 --> 00:19:22.862
- Uhuh. Here you go. baby.

482
00:19:22.896 --> 00:19:24.206
It's gonna be all right.

483
00:19:24.241 --> 00:19:26.241
Anybody else want a bloody Mary?

484
00:19:26.275 --> 00:19:26.965
- We do!

485
00:19:28.896 --> 00:19:30.827
- Hey.

486
00:19:30.862 --> 00:19:32.206
- Good morning. Sis.

487
00:19:33.034 --> 00:19:34.517
Family!

488
00:19:34.551 --> 00:19:35.655
- What's up with you. uncle?

489
00:19:35.689 --> 00:19:36.551
- Family!

490
00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:38.689
- Hi. uncle.
- What's up Cyd?

491
00:19:38.724 --> 00:19:39.689
How you doing? You looking good.

492
00:19:39.724 --> 00:19:41.310
- Thank you.

493
00:19:41.344 --> 00:19:42.793
- What's up y'all?
- What's up man?

494
00:19:42.827 --> 00:19:44.689
- Gloria.

495
00:19:44.724 --> 00:19:45.620
- Jerome.

496
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.206
- Meet my lady. Shawna.

497
00:19:48.241 --> 00:19:50.206
- Hey. What's up Shawn?

498
00:19:50.241 --> 00:19:52.793
How you doing?
- Another one?

499
00:19:52.827 --> 00:19:55.379
- Don't mind her.
She just jealous.

500
00:19:55.413 --> 00:19:56.689
She always wanted me.

501
00:19:56.724 --> 00:19:58.344
- Lies you tell.

502
00:19:58.379 --> 00:20:00.206
Well Jerome. we were
just talking to Todd

503
00:20:00.241 --> 00:20:02.344
about his breakup with Janelle.

504
00:20:02.379 --> 00:20:05.862
Seeing that you know everything.
you got any advice for him?

505
00:20:05.896 --> 00:20:08.275
- Well. you know.
I know everything.

506
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:09.689
He. he look good though.

507
00:20:11.241 --> 00:20:13.655
His nose is slightly
off a little bit.

508
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.793
I can readjust
that a little bit.

509
00:20:16.827 --> 00:20:19.275
Get you looking a little
bit more perpendicular.

510
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:20.896
- No. I'm good. I appreciate it.

511
00:20:20.931 --> 00:20:23.793
- We are all good with
all of that. Jerome.

512
00:20:23.827 --> 00:20:25.724
- Well. I don't wanna
stay around here too long.

513
00:20:25.758 --> 00:20:29.448
I just came over to say
hello. You want some bacon?

514
00:20:29.482 --> 00:20:31.862
You know. me and my lady.
we got places to go.

515
00:20:31.896 --> 00:20:35.206
We got a birthday
party. a subway party.

516
00:20:35.241 --> 00:20:36.758
We got parties to go to.

517
00:20:36.793 --> 00:20:38.379
And a little brunch.

518
00:20:38.413 --> 00:20:40.517
you know. in this
holiday season.

519
00:20:40.551 --> 00:20:41.965
You want some bacon?

520
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.862
You want some fruit?
You want some pancakes?

521
00:20:44.896 --> 00:20:46.206
Look.

522
00:20:46.241 --> 00:20:47.862
- You bring my plate back.

523
00:20:47.896 --> 00:20:48.620
- I always bring your
plate back. don't I?

524
00:20:48.655 --> 00:20:49.758
- No. you don't.

525
00:20:49.793 --> 00:20:51.344
- No. you didn't that last time.

526
00:20:51.379 --> 00:20:52.862
- Yeah. I love y'all
though. Come on.

527
00:20:55.689 --> 00:20:59.206
- What in the hell?

528
00:20:59.241 --> 00:21:00.758

00:29:34.241 --> 00:29:35.827
His loss.

00:29:59.931 --> 00:30:01.275
He. he turned in early.

719
00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:03.827
- He wasn't feeling well.
- Okay.

720
00:30:03.862 --> 00:30:06.896
- In fact. Chris. I'm
not feeling well either.

721
00:30:06.931 --> 00:30:09.137
so I'm gonna go
lie down too. okay?

722
00:30:10.206 --> 00:30:12.827
- Good night. Feel better.

723
00:30:12.862 --> 00:30:13.482
- Well. let's get you situated.

724
00:30:13.517 --> 00:30:14.379
- Okay.

725
00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:18.379
- I'm kinda tired too.

726
00:30:19.482 --> 00:30:22.344
Yeah.
[laughing]

727
00:30:28.931 --> 00:30:31.000
- Oh.

728
00:30:31.034 --> 00:30:34.448
- I'm sorry. I didn't think
anybody would be up this late.

729
00:30:34.482 --> 00:30:36.482
- It's all good.

730
00:30:36.517 --> 00:30:38.448
I didn't actually know anybody
else would be here either.

731
00:30:39.482 --> 00:30:41.413
I just couldn't sleep.

732
00:30:41.448 --> 00:30:42.310
- Oh. yeah?

733
00:30:43.379 --> 00:30:46.137
Yeah. Well. tell me about it.

734
00:30:49.413 --> 00:30:50.896
- I'm Todd.

735
00:30:50.931 --> 00:30:51.586
Todd Wesley.

736
00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:52.517
- Hi Todd.

737
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.275
- What's up? Who are you?

738
00:30:57.448 --> 00:31:02.206
- That part. I'm Ryan
Johnson. Cydney's roommate.

739
00:31:03.517 --> 00:31:04.620
- Oh yeah. We
talked on the phone.

740
00:31:04.655 --> 00:31:06.448
- We did.
- Okay. yeah.

741
00:31:06.482 --> 00:31:07.172
I mean. I didn't know
Cydney was bringing

742
00:31:07.206 --> 00:31:08.896
anybody for the holidays though.

743
00:31:08.931 --> 00:31:10.344
- Oh. well she wasn't.

744
00:31:10.379 --> 00:31:12.896
I mean. I wasn't gonna come.

745
00:31:14.206 --> 00:31:15.275
I had all the plans.

746
00:31:16.655 --> 00:31:19.344
but then I realized I
had no plans at all.

747
00:31:19.379 --> 00:31:21.344
Like no real plans.
But you know what?

748
00:31:22.931 --> 00:31:24.896
I told myself I
wasn't gonna do this.

749
00:31:24.931 --> 00:31:26.517
I'm just happy to be here.

750
00:31:26.551 --> 00:31:28.448
I'm just happy to be here.
- Happy to have you.

751
00:31:28.482 --> 00:31:30.344
- Yeah.
[laughing]

752
00:31:30.379 --> 00:31:31.896
- Hey. Ken. What's going on?

753
00:31:31.931 --> 00:31:33.931
- I just checked Malcolm's insta

754
00:31:33.965 --> 00:31:36.137
and he's on there all
hooked up with another girl.

755
00:31:36.172 --> 00:31:37.896
I mean. he's all over this ho.

756
00:31:37.931 --> 00:31:39.517
he hasn't even called me.

757
00:31:39.551 --> 00:31:41.241
So stupid.

758
00:31:41.275 --> 00:31:43.448
- Oh. Kennedy. you know what?

759
00:31:43.482 --> 00:31:46.482
It's good that you're learning
this lesson early because

760
00:31:46.517 --> 00:31:49.655
maybe it will help you
not get your heart broken

761
00:31:49.689 --> 00:31:51.586
in the future.

762
00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:52.896
Baby girl.

763
00:31:52.931 --> 00:31:54.517
All men are dogs.

764
00:31:54.551 --> 00:31:55.413
- Wait. what?

765
00:31:55.448 --> 00:31:57.448
No. no. no. no.

766
00:31:57.482 --> 00:31:59.413
That's not true. All
men are not dogs.

767
00:31:59.448 --> 00:32:01.551
Your Uncle Todd
ain't no dog. Okay?

768
00:32:02.724 --> 00:32:03.586
Real men don't cheat.

769
00:32:05.068 --> 00:32:08.965
But. women do cheat as well.

770
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.551
Sorry?
- Oh. correction.

771
00:32:11.586 --> 00:32:13.034
Correction.

772
00:32:13.068 --> 00:32:14.724
Not all women. Okay.

773
00:32:14.758 --> 00:32:16.413
- So all men cheat.
but not all women?

774
00:32:16.448 --> 00:32:18.448
- Correct.

775
00:32:18.482 --> 00:32:19.379
Where they do that at?
What are you talking about?

776
00:32:19.413 --> 00:32:21.517
That don't sound right to me.

777
00:32:21.551 --> 00:32:22.551
- I read it in the Bible.

778
00:32:24.137 --> 00:32:26.034
- Please. keep going.

779
00:32:26.068 --> 00:32:27.620
- The Bible?
- Yes.

780
00:32:27.655 --> 00:32:29.551
What's chapter was that?
Second contradictions?

781
00:32:31.517 --> 00:32:34.275
[war explosions]

782
00:32:37.344 --> 00:32:41.275
[bombs exploding. guns firing]

783
00:32:44.068 --> 00:32:47.413
[yelling. breathing heavily]

784
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.655
- This service tonight
is really important.

785
00:33:00.689 --> 00:33:02.482
It seems like everybody
in this family

786
00:33:02.517 --> 00:33:04.586
is going through something.

787
00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:06.517
Christmas doesn't
even feel the same.

788
00:33:06.551 --> 00:33:09.689
Yeah. baby. Baby.
it will. all right?

789
00:33:09.724 --> 00:33:13.172
Now. Reverend Timmons always
seems to do the trick.

790
00:33:13.206 --> 00:33:15.517
- Reverend Timmons
hears the word from God.

791
00:33:16.827 --> 00:33:18.413
And we'll hear
God's word tonight.

792
00:33:18.448 --> 00:33:19.724
- Amen.

793
00:33:19.758 --> 00:33:21.034
- And we need it.

794
00:33:21.068 --> 00:33:22.551
- Yes. Amen.

795
00:33:24.482 --> 00:33:25.586
- Oh.

796
00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:27.275
- I got it. I got it.

797
00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:30.103
Okay center.
- All right. Center.

798
00:33:30.137 --> 00:33:32.482
[curious music]

799
00:33:39.103 --> 00:33:42.137
- Hey Gina. can you speak now?

800
00:33:42.172 --> 00:33:45.172
Listen. I am so sorry for
all the sneaking around.

801
00:33:45.206 --> 00:33:46.655
but I really need to see you.

802
00:33:48.206 --> 00:33:50.689
Don't call me back and
don't leave a message.

803
00:33:50.724 --> 00:33:53.034
She might check my phone.
I'll call you when I can.

804
00:33:53.068 --> 00:33:54.448
Please. Bye.

805
00:33:56.206 --> 00:33:58.103
- Y'all. And then dad was like.
I need to keep it a secret.

806
00:33:58.137 --> 00:34:00.241
But I don't understand why.
Like. what's the secret. dad?

807
00:34:00.275 --> 00:34:01.379
I mean. really.

808
00:34:01.413 --> 00:34:03.241
I just. I'm trying to be nosy.

809
00:34:03.275 --> 00:34:06.379
I love mornings like this
during the Christmas holiday.

810
00:34:06.413 --> 00:34:07.793
They're just so special.

811
00:34:07.827 --> 00:34:08.724
Don't you agree. Mom?

812
00:34:08.758 --> 00:34:10.241
- Oh. I do.

813
00:34:10.275 --> 00:34:12.241
And I have a big
surprise for you tonight

814
00:34:12.275 --> 00:34:14.241
at the Christmas
celebration at church.

815

- Cheers.

819
00:34:19.758 --> 00:34:21.724
- What are you drinking. Glo?

820
00:34:21.758 --> 00:34:23.172
- Just a little
Christmas celebration.

821
00:34:23.206 --> 00:34:24.827
A libation. whatever
you want to call it.

822
00:34:24.862 --> 00:34:27.517
[all giggling]

823
00:34:30.413 --> 00:34:31.655
- Uncle Todd!

824
00:34:31.689 --> 00:34:33.413
- No. no. no. no. man.

825
00:34:34.827 --> 00:34:36.586

00:34:38.275 --> 00:34:39.379
Where are you going?

00:34:39.413 --> 00:34:40.827
- Oh. I'm headed up the street

829
00:34:40.862 --> 00:34:42.724
to mind your business. Cydney.

830
00:34:42.758 --> 00:34:44.724

tonight at the church?

832
00:34:46.137 --> 00:34:48.137
- Yes ma'am.

833
00:34:48.172 --> 00:34:49.137
I'm already dressed and I
wouldn't miss it for the world.

834
00:34:49.172 --> 00:34:50.172

If they don't want folks
smoking in the church bathroom.

842
00:35:04.896 --> 00:35:06.620
they need to put a sign up.

843
00:35:06.655 --> 00:35:08.206
- Lord.

844
00:35:08.241 --> 00:35:10.137
- But don't you
worry. I'll be here.

Come on. Syl. We

00:35:39.206 --> 00:35:41.241
- Taryn. we could have totally
ditched this for the mall.

851
00:35:41.275 --> 00:35:43.655
I need to find some cute
boys to put my story.

852
00:35:43.689 --> 00:35:45.379
- Ken. why are you
being so petty?

853
00:35:45.413 --> 00:35:47.620
It doesn't have to be
tat for tat with Malcolm.

854
00:35:47.655 --> 00:35:49.413
- Yeah. but it'll
make me feel better

855
00:35:49.448 --> 00:35:51.137
if he thinks I'm not
thinking about him.

856
00:35:51.172 --> 00:35:52.689
- Fine tomorrow. then?

- Now I want you this
Christmas to spread some love.

862

Remind somebody they matter.

863

Do a kind gesture.

864
00:36:17.827 --> 00:36:21.551
It's giving time this
season to give to others.

865
00:36:22.482 --> 00:36:23.758
It'll go a long way.

00:47:37.068 --> 00:47:39.620
I made a lifestyle change.
But who could blame me?

1061
00:47:39.655 --> 00:47:43.482
Really. Todd he offered me
everything you couldn't.

1062
00:47:43.517 --> 00:47:48.310
I mean the fancy mansion
and the cars and the staff.

1063
00:47:49.689 --> 00:47:50.896
I mean. he paraded me
around in designer bags

1064
00:47:50.931 --> 00:47:52.517
and clothes and jewelry.

1065
00:47:52.551 --> 00:47:54.482
- Yo. Janelle. ain't
nobody trying to hear this.

1066
00:47:54.517 --> 00:47:55.379
What's your point?

1067
00:47:56.655 --> 00:47:57.517
- I know.

1068
00:47:59.344 --> 00:48:00.413
My point is. I had it all.

1069
00:48:02.137 --> 00:48:03.586
So I thought.

1070
00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:06.000
- It sound like you
was living a dream.

1071
00:48:06.034 --> 00:48:07.413
- I really was.

1072
00:48:09.206 --> 00:48:11.241
That is. until he
told me he wanted to

1073
00:48:11.275 --> 00:48:12.413
share everything with me.

1074
00:48:17.137 --> 00:48:19.034
- Ain't that what you wanted?

1075
00:48:19.068 --> 00:48:23.034
- I did. but everything
meant his other women too.

1076
00:48:24.448 --> 00:48:25.275
- You serious?

1077
00:48:26.448 --> 00:48:28.103
That's why you here.

1078
00:48:28.137 --> 00:48:29.586
Cause yo cheater cheated.

1079
00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:32.034
- No. I'm here because I
realized I was in love.

1080
00:48:32.068 --> 00:48:33.034
but it wasn't with him.

1081
00:48:35.137 --> 00:48:39.344
I miss my husband.
My Hottie Toddy.

1082
00:48:39.379 --> 00:48:41.689
And I want us to
get back together.

1083
00:48:41.724 --> 00:48:44.034
Okay even. even if it
means we have to struggle

1084
00:48:44.068 --> 00:48:44.689
for a little while longer.

1085
00:48:44.724 --> 00:48:45.586
I miss us.

1086
00:48:47.103 --> 00:48:49.034
- You can't be-
- Shh.

1087
00:48:49.068 --> 00:48:51.206
Don't answer yet. okay?

1088
00:48:51.241 --> 00:48:54.103
I realize this is
a lot to take in.

1089
00:48:54.137 --> 00:48:56.517
So I booked a room at the W.

1090
00:48:56.551 --> 00:48:58.103
I'll go freshen up.

1091
00:48:58.137 --> 00:49:00.137
I'll pick up a few
Christmas gifts.

1092
00:49:00.172 --> 00:49:02.172
I know I have a lot of
work to do to get back in

1093
00:49:02.206 --> 00:49:05.137
with your family.
especially with Cydney.

1094
00:49:05.172 --> 00:49:07.034
- Janelle. that's not even-
- Shh.

1095
00:49:07.068 --> 00:49:07.551
Don't talk yet.

1096
00:49:09.689 --> 00:49:11.000
We can fix this.

1097
00:49:17.137 --> 00:49:17.586
Bye babes.

1098
00:49:36.758 --> 00:49:38.517
- Yo. Dennis. What's
going on. man?

1099
00:49:38.551 --> 00:49:39.655
Happy holidays.
How are you living?

1100
00:49:41.517 --> 00:49:45.034
Good. Hey. look. we gotta talk.

1101
00:49:45.068 --> 00:49:45.551
You got a minute?

1102
00:49:50.068 --> 00:49:52.068
- So are you ready
to make Mr. Elkins

1103
00:49:52.103 --> 00:49:54.482
our good deed project
for Christmas?

1104
00:49:54.517 --> 00:49:57.034
- I don't know.
- Come on.

1105
00:49:57.068 --> 00:49:58.620
He looks like he can
use some kindness.

1106
00:50:00.103 --> 00:50:01.758
And a makeover.

1107
00:50:01.793 --> 00:50:04.310
Remember Pastor Timson
about helping people?

1108
00:50:04.344 --> 00:50:06.172
You should help him.

1109
00:50:06.206 --> 00:50:08.724
Plus you need to get
your mind off of Malcolm.

1110
00:50:08.758 --> 00:50:10.482
This is the perfect distraction.

1111
00:50:12.206 --> 00:50:13.310
- I don't feel like it. Taryn.

1112
00:50:13.344 --> 00:50:16.793
- Let's go. Ken. You owe me one.

1113
00:50:16.827 --> 00:50:18.482
And it's Christmas.

1114
00:50:20.793 --> 00:50:25.586
[crying]
[poignant music]

1115
00:50:43.689 --> 00:50:45.482
- We made vows. Regina.

1116
00:50:45.517 --> 00:50:47.172
- Through sickness
and health. Marcus.

1117
00:50:47.206 --> 00:50:49.620
It's not crazy.
- Look. look.

1118
00:50:49.655 --> 00:50:51.275
But it's Christmas Eve.

1119
00:50:51.310 --> 00:50:52.620
Come on. Just talk
to me about this.

1120
00:50:54.068 --> 00:50:56.655
- You went to war my husband.

1121
00:50:56.689 --> 00:50:59.310
and came back a
stranger. Marcus.

1122
00:50:59.344 --> 00:51:00.620
- Look. I know and I'm sorry

1123
00:51:00.655 --> 00:51:02.620
- I can't do this anymore.

1124
00:51:02.655 --> 00:51:04.551
You need to get
yourself together.

1125
00:51:06.413 --> 00:51:07.724
Or you'll always be alone.

1126
00:51:08.758 --> 00:51:10.586
- Come on Regina. please.

1127
00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:11.517
You can't leave
right now. Regina.

1128
00:51:11.551 --> 00:51:13.241
Come on Regina. I love you babe.

1129
00:51:13.275 --> 00:51:14.034
- Marcus. Goodbye.

1130
00:51:17.586 --> 00:51:19.413
I can't do this anymore.

1131
00:51:20.827 --> 00:51:24.379
You'll always be alone.
You'll always be alone.

1132
00:51:24.413 --> 00:51:26.137
You'll always be alone.

1133
00:51:27.758 --> 00:51:29.068
[door pounding]

1134
00:51:29.103 --> 00:51:29.551
- Oh. shit.

1135
00:51:31.241 --> 00:51:32.517
What do you want?

1136
00:51:34.827 --> 00:51:36.862
Ugh.

1137
00:51:36.896 --> 00:51:38.068
- We wanna invite you
for Christmas Eve dinner.

1138
00:51:38.103 --> 00:51:39.551
- I'm not interested.

1139
00:51:39.586 --> 00:51:41.482
- How do you know?
You've never been.

1140
00:51:41.517 --> 00:51:43.068
- I'm fine here.

1141
00:51:43.103 --> 00:51:45.172
- Mr. Marcus. how
can you be fine here?

1142
00:51:45.206 --> 00:51:47.758
Your place isn't mess and I
don't smell anything cooking.

1143
00:51:47.793 --> 00:51:50.586
- Yeah. We have a
delicious dinner plan.

1144
00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:54.379
Okay. we got Turkey.
ham. sweet potatoes.

1145
00:51:54.413 --> 00:51:57.620
mac and cheese. pies. cake.

1146
00:51:59.413 --> 00:52:00.551
What happened here?

1147
00:52:01.206 --> 00:52:03.413
- Oh.

1148
00:52:03.448 --> 00:52:04.931
I just had a little spill.

1149
00:52:04.965 --> 00:52:06.758
So. so dinner. huh?

1150
00:52:12.482 --> 00:52:13.724
Okay. that sounds good.

1151
00:52:15.241 --> 00:52:18.413
But I don't have
nothing to wear.

1152
00:52:18.448 --> 00:52:19.793
- We got you on that.

1153
00:52:26.724 --> 00:52:28.310
- Thank you brother.

1154
00:52:28.344 --> 00:52:29.862
- No problem. You
know I got you.

1155
00:52:29.896 --> 00:52:31.655
- Couldn't do without you.

1156
00:52:31.689 --> 00:52:34.448
- I think that
covers everything.

1157
00:52:34.482 --> 00:52:35.137
Lets see.

1158
00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:38.655
Where's your brother?

1159
00:52:38.689 --> 00:52:40.620
I can bring him up on the
app data if you want me to.

1160
00:52:40.655 --> 00:52:42.241
- I think he's here.

1161
00:52:42.275 --> 00:52:43.448
Let me go try to find him.

1162
00:52:43.482 --> 00:52:44.931
- I'll be right here.

1163
00:52:44.965 --> 00:52:46.241
- Hey. thank you
man. Thanks again.

1164
00:52:46.275 --> 00:52:48.620
- No problem. I got you. man.

1165
00:52:51.344 --> 00:52:52.758
- [Cydney] Todd. where
are your headphones?

1166
00:52:52.793 --> 00:52:53.896
I need to use them.

1167
00:52:53.931 --> 00:52:55.689
- Oh. Hi.

1168
00:52:57.344 --> 00:52:59.103
I'm so sorry. I thought
Todd was in here.

1169
00:53:00.413 --> 00:53:01.620
- Who are you?

1170
00:53:01.655 --> 00:53:05.517
- I'm Dennis. Todd's attorney.

1171
00:53:05.551 --> 00:53:06.689
And you are?

1172
00:53:06.724 --> 00:53:08.448
- Oh. I'm Cydney. Todd's sister.

1173
00:53:08.482 --> 00:53:10.310
- I didn't realize
that Todd had a sister.

1174
00:53:10.344 --> 00:53:12.275
I was only aware of
his brother. Chris.

1175
00:53:12.310 --> 00:53:13.689
- Well. he does.

1176
00:53:13.724 --> 00:53:14.689
And we're not in
business together.

1177
00:53:14.724 --> 00:53:15.862
I live in New York.

1178
00:53:15.896 --> 00:53:16.724
- Really?

1179
00:53:18.379 --> 00:53:20.275
- New York. huh.

1180
00:53:20.310 --> 00:53:23.517
Are you here for the
holidays with your husband?

1181
00:53:23.551 --> 00:53:25.000
- Please. I'm not married.

1182
00:53:25.034 --> 00:53:26.862
- Excuse me.

1183
00:53:26.896 --> 00:53:29.586
- You're excused. Nice
to meet you Dennis.

1184
00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:31.000
Happy holidays.

1185
00:53:31.034 --> 00:53:32.655
- Happy holidays. Cydney.

1186
00:53:35.413 --> 00:53:36.689
- Hey. what's up Ryan?

1187
00:53:36.724 --> 00:53:38.379
- Hey.

1188
00:53:38.413 --> 00:53:39.862
- What's up? I haven't
seen you all day.

1189
00:53:39.896 --> 00:53:41.862
- Yeah. I've been in
the kitchen baking.

1190
00:53:43.896 --> 00:53:44.793
You good?

1191
00:53:47.413 --> 00:53:49.793
- No. no. I'm not.

1192
00:53:52.241 --> 00:53:53.689
Janelle.

1193
00:53:53.724 --> 00:53:55.517
She's trying to like
put the marriage

1194
00:53:55.551 --> 00:53:56.724
and stuff back together.

1195
00:53:57.620 --> 00:53:59.206
- Wow.

1196
00:53:59.241 --> 00:54:00.965
Whew.

1197
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:02.793
You've really been
going through it. huh?

1198
00:54:06.379 --> 00:54:07.896
You know what?

1199
00:54:07.931 --> 00:54:12.448
A good friend would
tell you that you just.

1200
00:54:12.482 --> 00:54:14.000
you need to take some
time to think about

1201
00:54:14.034 --> 00:54:16.931
what it is you want and
need in a relationship.

1202
00:54:18.827 --> 00:54:21.379
And a good friend would
also tell you that

1203
00:54:21.413 --> 00:54:25.758
you are a smart man and only
you know what's best for you.

1204
00:54:25.793 --> 00:54:27.862
So just be careful. Okay?

1205
00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:33.620
- I appreciate you. Ryan.

1206
00:54:35.965 --> 00:54:36.862
Thanks.

1207
00:54:38.379 --> 00:54:39.000
Good friend.

1208
00:54:40.965 --> 00:54:41.758
- Come here.

1209
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.344
- Yo. Chris. Happy you here man.

1210
00:55:06.379 --> 00:55:07.965
Hey. Dennis is upstairs

1211
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:08.896
and let's talk about
the acquisition.

1212
00:55:08.931 --> 00:55:10.517
You got a couple minutes?

1213
00:55:10.551 --> 00:55:12.344
- I really ain't got
time for this bro.

1214
00:55:12.379 --> 00:55:13.931
- Can you please just
come upstairs real quick?

1215
00:55:13.965 --> 00:55:16.034
It's not gonna take long at all.

1216
00:55:16.068 --> 00:55:16.965
And it's important you know
what's going with the app.

1217
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.034
- You just don't get it. do you?

1218
00:55:19.068 --> 00:55:20.931
- Oh. Chris. can you. can you
please just come upstairs?

1219
00:55:20.965 --> 00:55:22.482
Can you spare me a
couple of minutes?

1220
00:55:22.517 --> 00:55:23.448
Dennis is on the clock.

1221
00:55:25.689 --> 00:55:26.758
- You got one minute.

1222
00:55:30.931 --> 00:55:32.448
- Meet my brother. Chris.

1223
00:55:32.482 --> 00:55:35.344
- Chris. nice to
finally meet you. bro.

1224
00:55:35.379 --> 00:55:36.862
Heard great things about you.

1225
00:55:36.896 --> 00:55:38.068
- Well. unfortunately
I can't say

1226
00:55:38.103 --> 00:55:39.724
the same thing
about you. Dennis.

1227
00:55:39.758 --> 00:55:41.517
because I'm sure. as you know.

1228
00:55:41.551 --> 00:55:43.103
my brother just let me
know about this investment.

1229
00:55:43.137 --> 00:55:45.000
- Nope.

1230
00:55:45.034 --> 00:55:46.000
Actually. Chris. he
didn't know that.

1231
00:55:47.862 --> 00:55:48.965
My apologies. Dennis.

1232
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:50.344
Can you excuse us for a second?

1233
00:55:52.448 --> 00:55:55.965
Chris. I realize
now more than ever

1234
00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.620
that I should have included
you in the decision.

1235
00:55:57.655 --> 00:55:59.862
And for that. I'm sorry.

1236
00:55:59.896 --> 00:56:03.034
But I've said sorry almost
a thousand times already.

1237
00:56:05.137 --> 00:56:06.655
Have you ever thought that
maybe this was your fault?

1238
00:56:06.689 --> 00:56:08.103
- My fault?
- Yeah. your fault.

1239
00:56:08.137 --> 00:56:09.896
- Man you must be
sipping. sniffing.

1240
00:56:09.931 --> 00:56:11.034
smoking. uncles' egg nog.

1241
00:56:11.068 --> 00:56:12.689
What are you talking about?

1242
00:56:12.724 --> 00:56:14.137
- I'm talking about
everything man.

1243
00:56:14.172 --> 00:56:16.448
You always trying
to take the lead.

1244
00:56:16.482 --> 00:56:19.034
You don't never let me make no
decisions. I can't even talk.

1245
00:56:19.068 --> 00:56:21.413
It's like you want me to
stay in your damn shadow.

1246
00:56:21.448 --> 00:56:22.413
- You know what? I'm not
trying to do this right now.

1247
00:56:22.448 --> 00:56:23.482
- Oh. you don't say?

1248
00:56:25.448 --> 00:56:27.000
Chris don't give a damn
about what Todd got to say.

1249
00:56:28.586 --> 00:56:30.413
You know. it's been like
that since we was kids.

1250
00:56:30.448 --> 00:56:31.827
Every time I would
try something.

1251
00:56:31.862 --> 00:56:32.965
you would try it.

1252
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:34.517
And then what would happen?

1253
00:56:34.551 --> 00:56:37.034
You'd do 10 times better
every single time.

1254
00:56:37.068 --> 00:56:39.724
In high school. it was sports.

1255
00:56:39.758 --> 00:56:42.103
In college. it was grades.

1256
00:56:42.137 --> 00:56:44.551
- And what's your point?

1257
00:56:44.586 --> 00:56:46.827
- And my point is
now in adulthood its
everything else. man.

1258
00:56:46.862 --> 00:56:47.965
You got the perfect life. man.

1259
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.034
You got it all.

1260
00:56:50.068 --> 00:56:51.034
You got a beautiful wife.
you got perfect kids.

1261
00:56:51.068 --> 00:56:53.482
And what I got? I got Janelle.

1262
00:56:56.172 --> 00:56:59.034
Look. I've always just
been the little brother.

1263
00:57:01.137 --> 00:57:03.000
but you've always been the big
brother that has no problem

1264
00:57:03.034 --> 00:57:04.551
letting the little brother
know how much better you are

1265
00:57:04.586 --> 00:57:06.793
as if I didn't already notice.

1266
00:57:06.827 --> 00:57:08.000
- You're my baby brother.

1267
00:57:09.586 --> 00:57:10.896
Bro I had no idea
you even felt that.

1268
00:57:10.931 --> 00:57:12.551
Why wouldn't you say anything?

1269
00:57:12.586 --> 00:57:14.586
- What you want me to
say. that I'm jealous?

1270
00:57:16.137 --> 00:57:18.000
That I feel like I
don't measure up?

1271
00:57:18.034 --> 00:57:18.068
Is that what you
want to hear? Huh?

1272
00:57:23.241 --> 00:57:25.793
I'm a prove to you and
everybody else in this world

1273
00:57:25.827 --> 00:57:26.965
that I'm great too.

1274
00:57:29.137 --> 00:57:30.965
- Yeah. you're great.
- Yeah. I'm great.

1275
00:57:32.689 --> 00:57:34.655
And that's why you
took all of our savings

1276
00:57:34.689 --> 00:57:36.655
and spent it to prove
to the whole world

1277
00:57:36.689 --> 00:57:38.068
that you're great. right?

1278
00:57:38.103 --> 00:57:39.620
- No. that's not what
happened. I invested it.

1279
00:57:39.655 --> 00:57:41.172
Yo. Dennis. can you please?

1280
00:57:41.206 --> 00:57:42.482
I can't-
- No. no. no.

1281
00:57:42.517 --> 00:57:44.137
I don't need no explanation.

1282
00:57:44.172 --> 00:57:45.103
Matter of fact. you're
an attorney. right?

1283
00:57:45.137 --> 00:57:46.758
- Yes I am.

1284
00:57:46.793 --> 00:57:48.206
- I'm gonna need you
to prepare the papers

1285
00:57:48.241 --> 00:57:50.000
to have my brother buy
me outta this company.

1286
00:57:50.034 --> 00:57:51.206
Now.
- You not making no sense.

1287
00:57:51.241 --> 00:57:53.896
Can you stop being
ridiculous? Come on man.

1288
00:57:53.931 --> 00:57:55.000
We too deep in it for that.

1289
00:57:57.172 --> 00:57:57.965
Look man. the app is already
getting amazing reviews.

1290
00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:59.620
Just give it a chance.

1291
00:57:59.655 --> 00:58:01.068
Yeah it's actually the
only app of is kind

1292
00:58:01.103 --> 00:58:03.034
where people can find
a service provider

1293
00:58:03.068 --> 00:58:05.310
to fix their issues at home.

1294
00:58:05.344 --> 00:58:09.034
Same day they find out that
cost of how much it's gonna be.

1295
00:58:09.068 --> 00:58:11.551
It's a cutting edge. Chris.
I'm saving a chance. man.

1296
00:58:11.586 --> 00:58:15.241
- Look. Chris. I already told
you we was gonna win big.

1297
00:58:15.275 --> 00:58:16.551
and I meant it.

1298
00:58:16.586 --> 00:58:18.724
But now I'm begging you.

1299
00:58:18.758 --> 00:58:22.896
Please hang in there with
me a little bit longer.

1300
00:58:24.206 --> 00:58:25.137
Would you just
trust me for once?

1301
00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:33.275
- Okay.

1302
00:58:34.827 --> 00:58:36.034
I mean we're in it. right?

1303
00:58:39.827 --> 00:58:41.172
Thank you Dennis.
- My pleasure.

1304
00:58:44.172 --> 00:58:45.275
- Todd. if you really
believe in this.

1305
00:58:45.310 --> 00:58:46.172
- Yes I do.

1306
00:58:49.827 --> 00:58:50.827
- I believe in you.

1307
00:58:50.862 --> 00:58:53.551
[sentimental music]

1308
00:58:53.586 --> 00:58:54.103
You got it.

1309
00:58:56.344 --> 00:58:57.068
You got it.

1310
00:59:03.206 --> 00:59:05.310
- Thank you. Appreciate you.

1311
00:59:05.344 --> 00:59:10.310
- Hey. if we could shift
gears here for a minute.

1312
00:59:10.344 --> 00:59:11.206
- What's good?

1313
00:59:12.793 --> 00:59:15.137
- Can we address your
gorgeous sister. Cydney?

1314
00:59:15.172 --> 00:59:16.034
- Cydney?

1315
00:59:17.103 --> 00:59:18.758
- Yeah.
[Todd laughing]

1316
00:59:18.793 --> 00:59:21.896
- Hey. hey. look
bro. Listen to me.

1317
00:59:21.931 --> 00:59:23.344
You don't want them
kind of problems.

1318
00:59:23.379 --> 00:59:25.310
You should just let
Cydney go. Trust me.

1319
00:59:25.344 --> 00:59:27.172
- Why. why. why not?

1320
00:59:27.206 --> 00:59:30.206
- My man. you can't
handle Cydney.

1321
00:59:30.241 --> 00:59:32.275
I don't know how to tell you.

1322
00:59:32.310 --> 00:59:33.241
I don't really think anybody
can to be honest with you.

1323
00:59:33.275 --> 00:59:34.689
Just let it go. Trust me.

1324
00:59:35.965 --> 00:59:39.689
- Todd. All right. you serious.

1325
00:59:39.724 --> 00:59:43.172
[everyone laughing]

1326
00:59:43.206 --> 00:59:45.379
- Y'all. I still cannot
believe that hooker

1327
00:59:45.413 --> 00:59:46.724
had the nerve to come back here

1328
00:59:46.758 --> 00:59:48.000
and expect Todd to forgive her.

1329
00:59:48.034 --> 00:59:49.793
- I know. right?

1330
00:59:49.827 --> 00:59:50.931
After we saw her prancing
around social media

1331
00:59:50.965 --> 00:59:52.000
like some football groupie.

1332
00:59:54.379 --> 00:59:57.862
- Ladies. I am pleased to report

1333
00:59:57.896 --> 00:59:59.793
that Malcolm is not a dog.

1334
00:59:59.827 --> 01:00:02.068
And the girl in the
picture is not a ho.

1335
01:00:02.103 --> 01:00:03.103
She's his cousin.

1336
01:00:04.827 --> 01:00:06.034
- Did she say ho?

1337
01:00:06.068 --> 01:00:07.724
- Who's Malcolm?
- Huh?

1338
01:00:07.758 --> 01:00:11.068
- They've been video
chatting all day.

1339
01:00:11.103 --> 01:00:13.137
- Yeah. we're back in love.

1340
01:00:13.172 --> 01:00:15.206
- Careful using
that L word. Ken.

1341
01:00:15.241 --> 01:00:16.068
- Especially when you
ain't talked to mommy yet.

1342
01:00:16.103 --> 01:00:17.068
Who is Malcolm?

1343
01:00:17.103 --> 01:00:18.000
- I did tell you!

1344
01:00:19.827 --> 01:00:23.068
- So I'm coming in with the
fellas and guess who I ran into?

1345
01:00:23.103 --> 01:00:25.310
[laughing]
- Jeff. Jeff?

1346
01:00:26.931 --> 01:00:28.310
What are you doing here?

1347
01:00:28.344 --> 01:00:31.068
- I got the address that
you sent me last week.

1348
01:00:31.103 --> 01:00:33.137
And I wanted to
surprise you. baby.

1349
01:00:33.172 --> 01:00:35.965
- Cydney. you do
have a boyfriend.

1350
01:00:38.931 --> 01:00:40.206
- Look at her face.

1351
01:00:40.241 --> 01:00:41.620
- How you doing Miss Wesley?

1352
01:00:41.655 --> 01:00:42.137
- Call me Mom.

1353
01:00:43.655 --> 01:00:46.172
- Mom. fam.

1354
01:00:46.206 --> 01:00:48.793
This is my friend Jefferson.

1355
01:00:48.827 --> 01:00:52.241
[everyone greeting]

1356
01:00:52.275 --> 01:00:55.965
- I thought I'd come down
and surprise my girl.

1357
01:00:59.758 --> 01:01:02.965
- Jeff is my friend
from New York.

1358
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.862
and there must have been
some sort of mix up.

1359
01:01:04.896 --> 01:01:06.689
See. I didn't mean to
send that address to you.

1360
01:01:06.724 --> 01:01:09.689
I thought I was
sending it to Ryan.

1361
01:01:09.724 --> 01:01:11.413
I'm so sorry.

1362
01:01:11.448 --> 01:01:12.137
- No worries.

1363
01:01:13.896 --> 01:01:15.137
Obviously your heart
wanted me here.

1364
01:01:17.310 --> 01:01:20.310
This could be a special
time for us. baby.

1365
01:01:20.344 --> 01:01:21.310
- And on that note.

1366
01:01:25.896 --> 01:01:26.310
Good luck. bro.

1367
01:01:28.413 --> 01:01:31.758
- well since you here.
how about a drink?

1368
01:01:31.793 --> 01:01:34.068
- Now that sounds lovely.

1369
01:01:35.413 --> 01:01:36.862
I know my way around
the kitchen too.

1370
01:01:36.896 --> 01:01:38.275
Let me help out.

1371
01:01:38.310 --> 01:01:40.206
- Okay. well go wash
your hands and come on.

1372
01:01:40.241 --> 01:01:41.931
- Yes ma'am.
- [Sylvia] You hungry?

1373
01:01:41.965 --> 01:01:43.000
- Yes ma'am.
- I'll fix you something.

1374
01:01:43.034 --> 01:01:44.448
- [Jeff] Thank you.

1375
01:01:44.482 --> 01:01:46.310
- Get the clean sheets
for the guest room.

1376
01:01:47.896 --> 01:01:49.827
- Mama.
- [Sylvia] What?

1377
01:01:49.862 --> 01:01:51.758
- He may not be staying.

1378
01:01:51.793 --> 01:01:54.448
- Wait girl. Girl. girl girl.

1379
01:01:54.482 --> 01:01:56.310
What is your boy doing here?

1380
01:01:56.344 --> 01:01:58.310
- Ryan. the text that
I meant to send to you

1381
01:01:58.344 --> 01:02:00.758
with the address. I
sent to Jefferson.

1382
01:02:00.793 --> 01:02:03.103
[Ryan laughing]

1383
01:02:03.137 --> 01:02:04.172
- Guess what happened?
- What?

1384
01:02:05.413 --> 01:02:07.379
Love found a way.
[laughing]

1385
01:02:07.413 --> 01:02:09.931
- I don't wanna be
bothered with him.

1386
01:02:09.965 --> 01:02:11.379
- By the looks of it. Aunt Glo

1387
01:02:11.413 --> 01:02:14.241
pretty much has
him tied up. okay?

1388
01:02:14.275 --> 01:02:15.896
So how about we just
go back in the kitchen

1389
01:02:15.931 --> 01:02:17.344
and finish what we started?

1390
01:02:17.379 --> 01:02:18.482
- I can't.
- Why?

1391
01:02:18.517 --> 01:02:20.793
- I need a minute.

1392
01:02:20.827 --> 01:02:22.827
You know. you go ahead and
get him some clean sheets

1393
01:02:22.862 --> 01:02:24.103
and I. you know.

1394
01:02:24.137 --> 01:02:26.172
Uncle Jerome just got here.

1395
01:02:26.206 --> 01:02:28.034
I'm a hangout out with him.
- Okay.

1396
01:02:28.068 --> 01:02:30.172
I'll get him some clean
sheets and put it in the room

1397
01:02:30.206 --> 01:02:31.448
beside you. darling.

1398
01:02:31.482 --> 01:02:32.482
'Cause your mama said so.

1399
01:02:34.172 --> 01:02:36.241
[jolly music]

1400
01:02:36.275 --> 01:02:37.344
- It's not that I'm
trying to be difficult.

1401
01:02:37.379 --> 01:02:39.206
I just know what I want.

1402
01:02:39.241 --> 01:02:41.137
- You just like
your Uncle Jerome.

1403
01:02:41.172 --> 01:02:43.344
I can't be tied down either.

1404
01:02:43.379 --> 01:02:46.000
All these women out here
just waiting to love on me.

1405
01:02:46.034 --> 01:02:49.344
We can't be monogamous.
Two players for life.

1406
01:02:49.379 --> 01:02:50.241
- Yeah.

1407
01:02:55.310 --> 01:02:57.931
- You better go ahead
with your bad self.

1408
01:02:57.965 --> 01:03:00.379
See Jerome? I told you
not to mess with my baby.

1409
01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:03.862
Oh yes.

1410
01:03:03.896 --> 01:03:05.448
- Here you go.

1411
01:03:05.482 --> 01:03:07.000
- Thank you. Thank
you very much.

1412
01:03:07.034 --> 01:03:08.379
This looks good.

1413
01:03:08.413 --> 01:03:10.482
Like I was saying.

1414
01:03:10.517 --> 01:03:13.344
I went over there to invite
him for a Christmas Eve dinner

1415
01:03:13.379 --> 01:03:14.931
and I saw his meds.

1416
01:03:14.965 --> 01:03:16.379
- Whose meds.

1417
01:03:16.413 --> 01:03:18.000
- Elkins.

1418
01:03:18.034 --> 01:03:18.862
- Are we still talking
about that old fool?

1419
01:03:18.896 --> 01:03:20.448
- Yeah. Yeah.

1420
01:03:20.482 --> 01:03:23.827
So anyway. he's taking
Zoloft and Prozac.

1421
01:03:23.862 --> 01:03:26.310
- Wait a minute. Sam
used to take that stuff.

1422
01:03:26.344 --> 01:03:31.137
- Yeah. Well it it's a common
medicine to help fight PTSD.

1423
01:03:32.586 --> 01:03:33.551
- Well that still
doesn't excuse him

1424
01:03:33.586 --> 01:03:34.827
for being the petty ass.

1425
01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:38.517
- I'm gonna step out
just for a second.

1426
01:03:40.448 --> 01:03:42.034
Glo. you can go ahead
and take my drink.

1427
01:03:42.068 --> 01:03:43.827
I know you want it.

1428
01:03:43.862 --> 01:03:45.103
- Well hopefully you
ain't got the cooties.

1429
01:03:45.137 --> 01:03:46.586
- [Bryan] Watch your mouth.

1430
01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:47.448
- Whatever.

1431
01:03:49.137 --> 01:03:50.517
And your problem would be?

1432
01:03:50.551 --> 01:03:51.413
- What?

1433
01:03:53.103 --> 01:03:54.103
- What is wrong with you?

1434
01:03:54.137 --> 01:03:55.827
- Nothing.

1435
01:03:55.862 --> 01:03:57.000
- You know I can see
it all in your face.

1436
01:03:57.034 --> 01:03:57.827
- Did you see that?

1437
01:03:59.413 --> 01:04:01.137
There's something
going on with Bryan.

1438
01:04:01.172 --> 01:04:03.931
He's been so secretive.

1439
01:04:03.965 --> 01:04:08.034
I mean. he goes
into the bathroom at
night with his phone.

1440
01:04:08.068 --> 01:04:11.034
He doesn't let me look
at the text messages.

1441
01:04:11.068 --> 01:04:13.448
And why all of a sudden
he needs a passcode

1442
01:04:13.482 --> 01:04:14.448
for his cell phone?

1443
01:04:16.931 --> 01:04:18.413
He's hiding something.

1444
01:04:18.448 --> 01:04:20.965
I can feel it in my gut.

1445
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
- So you think he's
having an affair?

1446
01:04:23.034 --> 01:04:23.965
- What else could it be?

1447
01:04:25.517 --> 01:04:27.655
- Girl. don't nobody
want your husband.

1448
01:04:27.689 --> 01:04:30.034
Y'all been married
for what. 34 years?

1449
01:04:30.068 --> 01:04:31.517
- 35 in January.

1450
01:04:31.551 --> 01:04:34.172
- Who throws away 35
years of marriage?

1451
01:04:34.206 --> 01:04:35.862
Don't nobody want you or him.

1452
01:04:37.689 --> 01:04:39.551
I'm just kidding.

1453
01:04:39.586 --> 01:04:42.448
But still. I know
Bryan. He ain't crazy.

1454
01:04:42.482 --> 01:04:43.517
He loves you.

1455
01:04:43.551 --> 01:04:44.517
- Well I hope so.

1456
01:04:46.379 --> 01:04:47.517
- Come on. let's toast it in.

1457
01:04:51.655 --> 01:04:54.344
- I'm gonna need four more
of these if it's true.

1458
01:04:54.379 --> 01:04:57.344
[doorbell ringing]

1459
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:00.689
- Hey. what's up Jay?

1460
01:05:03.551 --> 01:05:04.413
- Hello.

1461
01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:12.413
- How about we just go
talk in the den real quick?

1462
01:05:12.448 --> 01:05:14.068
- Oh. Todd. later.

1463
01:05:14.103 --> 01:05:16.379
I brought some
gifts for the fan.

1464
01:05:16.413 --> 01:05:19.241
I know I have some
making up to do.

1465
01:05:19.275 --> 01:05:22.310
especially with that Cydney.

1466
01:05:22.344 --> 01:05:23.965
You know what I was thinking?

1467
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.034
Maybe I could give
her a makeover.

1468
01:05:25.068 --> 01:05:26.689
- Hey. you know what?

1469
01:05:26.724 --> 01:05:27.965
Actually that's not gonna
be all that necessary.

1470
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:28.413
Jay.

1471
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.551
Look. I can't do this anymore.

1472
01:05:35.206 --> 01:05:36.655
So now I want a divorce.

1473
01:05:36.689 --> 01:05:40.310
[Janelle laughing]

1474
01:05:40.344 --> 01:05:43.034
- Okay. Okay. Todd. I get it.

1475
01:05:43.068 --> 01:05:45.034
You're trying to even
the playing field

1476
01:05:45.068 --> 01:05:49.068
and make me feel some kind of
way because I left you. right.

1477
01:05:49.103 --> 01:05:50.482
Okay. cool.

1478
01:05:50.517 --> 01:05:51.586
Go ahead. Have your moment.

1479
01:05:54.034 --> 01:05:56.310
But you can stop now. I'm
done playing games anymore.

1480
01:05:56.344 --> 01:05:58.551
- No Janelle. I'm not playing.

1481
01:06:00.068 --> 01:06:00.724
I never was.

1482
01:06:02.586 --> 01:06:04.379
This isn't it. Jay.

1483
01:06:04.413 --> 01:06:05.517
I can't do it anymore.

1484
01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:09.448
- Todd. I said I'm sorry.

1485
01:06:09.482 --> 01:06:11.172
What else do you want me to say?

1486
01:06:11.206 --> 01:06:14.379
I mean. I came here
to try to work it out.

1487
01:06:14.413 --> 01:06:16.275
- Listen.

1488
01:06:16.310 --> 01:06:18.344
Look. for the first time
in a very. very long time.

1489
01:06:19.517 --> 01:06:20.344
I get it.

1490
01:06:22.103 --> 01:06:24.275
I'm never gonna
be what you want.

1491
01:06:24.310 --> 01:06:26.482
You know. I'm being honest.

1492
01:06:26.517 --> 01:06:29.517
You've never been
what I need. Jay.

1493
01:06:31.172 --> 01:06:32.517
I deserve love too.

1494
01:06:35.172 --> 01:06:38.482
I need somebody who's gonna
support me. be there for me.

1495
01:06:38.517 --> 01:06:41.413
believe in me. love me.

1496
01:06:43.448 --> 01:06:45.517
Grow with me forever.

1497
01:06:45.551 --> 01:06:47.655
And Jay. we've never ever
had that connection. ever.

1498
01:06:49.827 --> 01:06:51.620
So I'm sorry. We just done.

1499
01:06:52.689 --> 01:06:54.724
- Baby. you don't mean that.

1500
01:06:57.137 --> 01:06:59.344
- I already had my attorney
draw up separation documents.

1501
01:07:02.379 --> 01:07:03.655
- You're really leaving me.

1502
01:07:10.689 --> 01:07:11.620
You know what?

1503
01:07:13.758 --> 01:07:16.137
That's okay. You never
deserve med anyway.

1504
01:07:16.172 --> 01:07:18.068
- That's right Janelle. I
ain't deserve none of this.

1505
01:07:18.103 --> 01:07:19.655
- Yeah. exactly.

1506
01:07:19.689 --> 01:07:21.206
Look at me.

1507
01:07:21.241 --> 01:07:23.551
I will always
secure my bag. Todd.

1508
01:07:23.586 --> 01:07:24.827
Okay?

1509
01:07:24.862 --> 01:07:26.655
Merry Christmas Todd.

1510
01:07:26.689 --> 01:07:28.068
Merry Christmas to
you and your family.

1511
01:07:28.103 --> 01:07:29.517
Merry Christmas to
you and yo dusty-

1512
01:07:29.551 --> 01:07:30.586
- So long. Janelle.

1513
01:07:48.689 --> 01:07:50.034
- So how does it look on you?

1514
01:07:51.827 --> 01:07:52.724
That sounds nice.

1515
01:07:54.206 --> 01:07:55.724
So when can we get together?

1516
01:07:57.379 --> 01:07:58.586
You know I need it.

1517
01:07:59.862 --> 01:08:01.310
Okay.

1518
01:08:01.344 --> 01:08:03.241
Okay. Listen.

1519
01:08:03.275 --> 01:08:05.551
I'll figure out a way to get
outta the house to see you.

1520
01:08:05.586 --> 01:08:06.241
Okay.

1521
01:08:08.482 --> 01:08:09.517
All right.

1522
01:08:09.551 --> 01:08:10.206
Goodbye.

1523
01:08:14.172 --> 01:08:15.620
[door knocking]

1524
01:08:15.655 --> 01:08:16.620
- [Marcus] Who is it?

1525
01:08:16.655 --> 01:08:18.551
- It's Ken and Taryn.

1526
01:08:18.586 --> 01:08:20.758
- [Marcus] Oh. look. look. look.

1527
01:08:20.793 --> 01:08:22.413
You all go back
home. now. all right?

1528
01:08:22.448 --> 01:08:24.241
I've changed my mind.

1529
01:08:24.275 --> 01:08:26.758
- No. Mr. Marcus. We
said we'll be back today.

1530
01:08:26.793 --> 01:08:29.241
- [Marcus] I know. but
I'm not going anywhere

1531
01:08:29.275 --> 01:08:31.241
so I don't need the makeover.

1532
01:08:31.275 --> 01:08:32.793
- You do need the makeover.

1533
01:08:35.758 --> 01:08:36.620
- Who's that?

1534
01:08:38.275 --> 01:08:41.413
- I don't think you
should park there.

1535
01:08:41.448 --> 01:08:42.862
I wouldn't park there
if far were you.

1536
01:08:42.896 --> 01:08:43.758
- What was that?

1537
01:08:46.413 --> 01:08:49.137
- Young man. Young
man. look here.

1538
01:08:49.172 --> 01:08:51.551
You can't park here. You
blocking my driveway.

1539
01:08:51.586 --> 01:08:52.931
- All right. Alright.

1540
01:08:52.965 --> 01:08:53.931
- [Marcus] You
gotta move your car.

1541
01:08:53.965 --> 01:08:55.793
- [Young Man] My bad.

1542
01:08:55.827 --> 01:08:56.793
I didn't see it. I'm about
to move it right now.

1543
01:09:17.689 --> 01:09:19.827
- You ladies are relentless.

1544
01:09:19.862 --> 01:09:20.724

[curious music]

1546
01:09:53.965 --> 01:09:55.965
- Oh. I want it. I want it.

1547
01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.620
- Look. I grew up
playing back here.

1548
01:10:06.655 --> 01:10:08.689
It's so cute.

1549
01:10:08.724 --> 01:10:10.448

We have the next few hours off.

1575
01:10:53.034 --> 01:10:54.310
- [Ryan] Yes. let's go.

1576
01:10:54.344 --> 01:10:55.000
- Sounds good. Let's roll.

1577
01:10:55.034 --> 01:10:55.862
- Hey baby.

1578
01:10:57.965 --> 01:10:58.827
Where we going?

1579
01:11:03.896 --> 01:11:08.896
- Hi.

1580
01:11:09.689 --> 01:11:10.000
- What's wrong?

1581
01:11:12.413 --> 01:11:14.000
- I saw him.

1582
01:11:14.034 --> 01:11:15.275
- You saw what?

1583
01:11:15.310 --> 01:11:16.000
- He was with someone else.

1584
01:11:17.482 --> 01:11:19.344
- How do you know?

1585
01:11:19.379 --> 01:11:22.896
- I followed him and he went
into this woman's house.

1586
01:11:32.896 --> 01:11:35.000
- She was a cutie though. right?

1587
01:11:35.034 --> 01:11:37.344
- Yeah. You know how they are.

1588
01:11:37.379 --> 01:11:39.448
- You all right Todd?
- Doing good. man.

1589
01:11:39.482 --> 01:11:40.586
What you got for me?

1590
01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:41.275
- Oh yeah.

1591
01:11:45.482 --> 01:11:46.931
This right here. my brother.

1592
01:11:48.379 --> 01:11:48.862
is for you.

1593
01:11:51.862 --> 01:11:52.931
Wanted you to have the
most recent updates

1594
01:11:52.965 --> 01:11:54.931
about your app deal.

1595
01:11:54.965 --> 01:11:57.275
- Dude. this can't be real.

1596
01:11:57.310 --> 01:11:58.758
- Nah. it's definitely real.

1597
01:12:02.068 --> 01:12:03.965
- We gotta find a
way to tell Chris.

1598
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:04.862
- Yeah. I know.

1599
01:12:06.379 --> 01:12:07.827
He's certainly gonna
feel away about this.

1600
01:12:10.517 --> 01:12:12.517
- You know what? Let's not
talk about this right now.

1601
01:12:12.551 --> 01:12:15.344
It's too close to
Christmas. but. all right.

1602
01:12:15.379 --> 01:12:16.344
- Whatever you say.

1603
01:12:16.379 --> 01:12:17.827
- Yeah. All right. cool.

1604
01:12:19.413 --> 01:12:21.827
[jolly music]

1605
01:12:24.137 --> 01:12:25.965
- How's your day
going. Ryan? You good?

1606
01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.793
- Oh. it's been fantastic today.

1607
01:12:27.827 --> 01:12:29.862
Just been chilling. you know.

1608
01:12:29.896 --> 01:12:30.827
putting the final touches
on Christmas Eve dinner.

1609
01:12:30.862 --> 01:12:32.413
Just relaxing.

1610
01:12:32.448 --> 01:12:33.827
- That's what's up.

1611
01:12:33.862 --> 01:12:35.000
Well look. I don't
know if y'all down.

1612
01:12:35.034 --> 01:12:36.068
but wanna play some cards?

1613
01:12:36.103 --> 01:12:37.896
- Ooh. How about teams?

1614
01:12:37.931 --> 01:12:39.000
Girls against guys.

1615
01:12:39.034 --> 01:12:41.068
- Hey. that sounds good to me.

1616
01:12:41.103 --> 01:12:44.310
- Teams. Don't you think it's
a little uneven right now?

1617
01:12:50.793 --> 01:12:51.655
- Hey. how you doing man?

1618
01:12:51.689 --> 01:12:52.827
Dennis Dobson.

1619
01:12:52.862 --> 01:12:54.448
- Jefferson Clark. I'm Cydney's-

1620
01:12:54.482 --> 01:12:57.310
- My friend. Jeff is my
friend from New York.

1621
01:12:58.758 --> 01:13:00.103
- Oh. okay.

1622
01:13:02.068 --> 01:13:04.827
- Well I'm gonna get a
refill on this drink.

1623
01:13:04.862 --> 01:13:06.379
Cyd?
- I'm good Jeff.

1624
01:13:15.068 --> 01:13:18.413
- Oh. so it's like that?

1625
01:13:18.448 --> 01:13:20.655
- That's exactly what it's like.

1626
01:13:20.689 --> 01:13:22.827
- You're a real
ball buster. huh?

1627
01:13:24.103 --> 01:13:25.586
No idea.

1628
01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:26.896
- Zero clue. Like.

1629
01:13:29.034 --> 01:13:30.586
- That's not fair.

1630
01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:32.413
I'm just protective
of what's mine.

1631
01:13:32.448 --> 01:13:36.000
And I'm not willing to
settle for anything less.

1632
01:13:36.034 --> 01:13:37.862
- Well. that's the way
it's supposed to be. right?

1633
01:13:39.448 --> 01:13:40.896
Is he your man?

1634
01:13:40.931 --> 01:13:44.034
- Jefferson? No. I
don't have a man.

1635
01:13:44.068 --> 01:13:46.103
I mean. I bring a
lot to the table.

1636
01:13:46.137 --> 01:13:48.551
and I'm not interested in
compromising my standards.

1637
01:13:48.586 --> 01:13:49.896
- Well that makes sense.

1638
01:13:52.103 --> 01:13:55.103
But in relationships there has
to be some compromise. right?

1639
01:13:55.137 --> 01:13:58.413
- Well yeah. but I'm
not gonna have someone

1640
01:13:58.448 --> 01:14:00.482
just come into my world
to get close to me

1641
01:14:00.517 --> 01:14:01.896
and break my heart.

1642
01:14:01.931 --> 01:14:03.172
- Well understand that.

1643
01:14:05.068 --> 01:14:07.896
But a real man would
never do that to you.

1644
01:14:09.689 --> 01:14:11.000
Not if he sees what he has.

1645
01:14:15.241 --> 01:14:17.517
- So do you know what you doing?

1646
01:14:17.551 --> 01:14:19.551
- Nope.

1647
01:14:19.586 --> 01:14:21.758
But I am gonna be a
celebrity stylist one day.

1648
01:14:21.793 --> 01:14:23.827
You'll be fine. I got you.

1649
01:14:25.655 --> 01:14:27.482
- So we'll give you a cut and
then you can take a shower.

1650
01:14:27.517 --> 01:14:29.517
Okay?
- I already bathed.

1651
01:14:29.551 --> 01:14:31.172
- When?

1652
01:14:31.206 --> 01:14:32.862
- Recently.

1653
01:14:32.896 --> 01:14:34.034
- When is recently?

1654
01:14:36.827 --> 01:14:38.103
- Oh. the 17th.

1655
01:14:38.137 --> 01:14:39.103
- Oh God.
- What?

1656
01:14:40.689 --> 01:14:42.068
- At least he didn't
say since the war.

1657
01:14:43.517 --> 01:14:44.241
- Oh. you got jokes. huh?

1658
01:14:44.275 --> 01:14:47.000
[both laughing]

1659
01:14:48.586 --> 01:14:50.965
[jolly music]

1660
01:14:52.827 --> 01:14:54.206
- I can get down now.

1661
01:14:54.241 --> 01:14:56.034
- Was middle school-

1662
01:14:56.068 --> 01:14:57.103
- Can I talk to
you for a second?

1663
01:14:57.137 --> 01:14:58.034
- Yeah.

1664
01:15:02.206 --> 01:15:04.206
- You know what. Cyd?
Maybe I should leave.

1665
01:15:04.241 --> 01:15:05.103
- Yeah?

1666
01:15:07.724 --> 01:15:09.137
- You could at least
try to hide it.

1667
01:15:11.172 --> 01:15:12.827
- I'm sorry. Jeffrey.

1668
01:15:12.862 --> 01:15:14.965
Look. I tried to tell
you back in New York.

1669
01:15:17.586 --> 01:15:19.172
you're a really great guy.

1670
01:15:20.103 --> 01:15:21.724
- Look look look.

1671
01:15:21.758 --> 01:15:23.000
I don't hate all of that.

1672
01:15:24.344 --> 01:15:26.862
You need to realize
what you want in life.

1673
01:15:26.896 --> 01:15:27.655
Cause I'm a catch.

1674
01:15:29.586 --> 01:15:32.517
And if you're not careful.
you're gonna end up an old man.

1675
01:15:34.758 --> 01:15:38.551
You know. I actually
feel sorry for you.

1676
01:15:41.206 --> 01:15:43.000
Or maybe I should
feel sorry for him.

1677
01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:03.172
- Hey.

1678
01:16:06.068 --> 01:16:07.103
Are you okay?

1679
01:16:12.655 --> 01:16:13.724
- I think we should chill.

1680
01:16:15.655 --> 01:16:17.172
Dealing with me
leads to nowhere.

1681
01:16:20.793 --> 01:16:23.068
I don't think I'm looking for
something serious right now.

1682
01:16:25.724 --> 01:16:28.103
- Well. maybe something
serious is looking for you.

1683
01:16:35.758 --> 01:16:38.241
[curious music]

1684
01:16:44.103 --> 01:16:45.000
- Hey baby.

1685
01:16:46.896 --> 01:16:48.793
- Where have you been?

1686
01:16:48.827 --> 01:16:53.000
- Oh. I was out getting some
fresh egg nog for dinner.

1687
01:16:53.034 --> 01:16:54.620
- Really?

1688
01:16:54.655 --> 01:16:57.137
- Yeah. Can you believe
everybody is sold out?

1689
01:16:58.931 --> 01:17:00.275
- I don't believe
much these days.

1690
01:17:08.793 --> 01:17:11.310
[doorbell ringing]

1691
01:17:13.965 --> 01:17:15.965
- Well. hello girls.

1692
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.310
- Ooh. who do we have here?

1693
01:17:18.344 --> 01:17:20.068
I thought I knew all
the handsome men in town

1694
01:17:20.103 --> 01:17:21.034
of a certain age.

1695
01:17:21.068 --> 01:17:22.689
Who is this?

1696
01:17:22.724 --> 01:17:25.689
- Auntie Glo. it's Mr.
Elkins. our neighbor.

1697
01:17:25.724 --> 01:17:27.275
- Elkins next door?

1698
01:17:27.310 --> 01:17:30.413
Marcus? The grinch?

1699
01:17:30.448 --> 01:17:33.724
- See children. I told you
this is not a good idea.

1700
01:17:33.758 --> 01:17:35.103
I'm gonna go.

1701
01:17:35.137 --> 01:17:38.241
- No. you are not leaving.

1702
01:17:38.275 --> 01:17:39.793
Auntie Glo.

1703
01:17:39.827 --> 01:17:41.137
- Okay. I was just kidding.

1704
01:17:42.827 --> 01:17:44.758
Well. you clean up very well.

1705
01:17:44.793 --> 01:17:46.103
- For a Grinch.

1706
01:17:46.137 --> 01:17:47.137
- For a Grinch.

1707
01:17:49.379 --> 01:17:51.310
- Well. alright then. Well.
let's go get you a margarita.

1708
01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.034
- Sylvia. Stop. stop.

1709
01:17:59.068 --> 01:18:00.206
What is the problem?

1710
01:18:01.793 --> 01:18:04.482
- I had no idea
Marcus was so fine.

1711
01:18:04.517 --> 01:18:06.482
Girl. what a little soap and
water can do for a brother.

1712
01:18:06.517 --> 01:18:09.517
But how do I navigate this?
I've been so mean to him.

1713
01:18:09.551 --> 01:18:12.758
- Well. you might
try apologizing.

1714
01:18:12.793 --> 01:18:14.896
But knowing you. that's
not gonna happen.

1715
01:18:14.931 --> 01:18:17.517
- I know how to
apologize. Bryan.

1716
01:18:17.551 --> 01:18:20.034
I've just never been
wrong. so I never had to.

1717
01:18:20.068 --> 01:18:21.379
- You ain't never wrong.

1718
01:18:21.413 --> 01:18:22.758
- You got something to say?

1719
01:18:22.793 --> 01:18:24.413
- I ain't say nothing.

1720
01:18:24.448 --> 01:18:26.862
Listen. Glo. I need
to speak to Sylvia.

1721
01:18:28.965 --> 01:18:30.827
- Where were you this afternoon?

1722
01:18:30.862 --> 01:18:34.000
- Well. I told you I went
to find some egg nog.

1723
01:18:34.034 --> 01:18:35.310
- That's a lie.
- What?

1724
01:18:35.344 --> 01:18:37.827
- I saw you.
- You saw me where?

1725
01:18:37.862 --> 01:18:39.448
- With her.

1726
01:18:39.482 --> 01:18:40.344
Really?

1727
01:18:41.413 --> 01:18:42.862
I thought we were so happy.

1728
01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:46.310
- Wait a minute.
Sylvia. you followed me?

1729
01:18:46.344 --> 01:18:47.931
- What does that have
to do with anything?

1730
01:18:47.965 --> 01:18:50.172
- Look. we'll talk
about this tomorrow.

1731
01:18:50.206 --> 01:18:51.344
- Oh.

1732
01:18:52.896 --> 01:18:56.413
- Go ahead and run
'cause you got caught.

1733
01:18:56.448 --> 01:18:58.310
- Do you really think
he's cheating Syl?

1734
01:18:58.344 --> 01:19:00.827
- Yes. I saw him.

1735
01:19:00.862 --> 01:19:05.241
I cannot believe this is
happening after 35 years.

1736
01:19:05.275 --> 01:19:07.413
- Well. let's deal
with this later.

1737
01:19:07.448 --> 01:19:09.275
Put a smile on your
face for your family.

1738
01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:13.000
- I can't pretend.
- Yes you can.

1739
01:19:13.034 --> 01:19:14.172
Let's deal with
this in the morning

1740
01:19:14.206 --> 01:19:16.310
after we open up
the gifts. okay?

1741
01:19:16.344 --> 01:19:18.448
Your family really
needs you right now.

1742
01:19:19.379 --> 01:19:20.241
Okay?

1743
01:19:22.586 --> 01:19:23.448
- Okay.

1744
01:19:25.068 --> 01:19:26.448
- All right. Come on.

1745
01:19:30.551 --> 01:19:31.379
- I got your Grinch.

1746
01:19:33.517 --> 01:19:34.827
- Oh. well that's something
I hadn't seen on you.

1747
01:19:34.862 --> 01:19:36.482
- What?

1748
01:19:36.517 --> 01:19:39.137
- It's almost as good as
that suit you have on.

1749
01:19:40.275 --> 01:19:41.379
You should smile more.

1750
01:19:43.448 --> 01:19:44.379
- Yeah well. there's
not a whole lot

1751
01:19:44.413 --> 01:19:46.551
to smile about these days.

1752
01:19:46.586 --> 01:19:49.068
- Well. tell me about the
time you were in the military.

1753
01:19:49.103 --> 01:19:50.586
Cause you know. I
was a military wife.

1754
01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:51.517
- Really?

1755
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.413
Well I was in from 73 to 75.

1756
01:19:57.620 --> 01:19:59.241
- Yeah?

1757
01:19:59.275 --> 01:20:01.413
Sam was there in 74.

1758
01:20:03.034 --> 01:20:05.275
Yeah. He just wasn't the
same when he came home.

1759
01:20:07.448 --> 01:20:11.310
- But you stuck with him. right?

1760
01:20:12.862 --> 01:20:15.586
I mean. I mean.
you stayed with him

1761
01:20:15.620 --> 01:20:18.448
even though he came
back different.

1762
01:20:18.482 --> 01:20:20.206
- Of course he was different.

1763
01:20:20.241 --> 01:20:22.482
But he was still my Sam.

1764
01:20:22.517 --> 01:20:25.000
And I stayed there with
him all the way to the end.

1765
01:20:25.034 --> 01:20:27.275
- Well. I'm sorry for your loss.

1766
01:20:27.310 --> 01:20:28.965
- Yeah. it's okay.

1767
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.103
It seems like the only
thing I remember are

1768
01:20:31.137 --> 01:20:32.827
our classic arguments.

1769
01:20:34.862 --> 01:20:36.137
- Yeah. Well. I'm sure he
didn't win many of those.

1770
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.344
- Anytime I would start a
sentence with his full name.

1771
01:20:40.379 --> 01:20:42.586
he knew all hell was
gonna break loose.

1772
01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:45.034
I would say. "Sam
Anthony Corbett."

1773
01:20:45.068 --> 01:20:48.310
"You hadn't emptied this
damn trash in two days."

1774
01:20:49.931 --> 01:20:51.896
Boy. He was lazy.

1775
01:20:51.931 --> 01:20:56.000
For a military guy. he just
wasn't that disciplined.

1776
01:20:56.034 --> 01:21:00.344
- You said your husband's
name was Sam Corbett?

1777
01:21:00.379 --> 01:21:01.482
- Yeah.

1778
01:21:01.517 --> 01:21:04.517
- First Sergeant Sam A Corbett.

1779
01:21:04.551 --> 01:21:07.241
of the fourth Infantry division.

1780
01:21:07.275 --> 01:21:08.482
- I mean. you knew him?

1781
01:21:09.689 --> 01:21:12.413
- I fought right alongside him.

1782
01:21:12.448 --> 01:21:14.413
He was our platoon leader.

1783
01:21:14.448 --> 01:21:17.034
- Oh my God.

1784
01:21:17.068 --> 01:21:20.310
- I can't tell you how many
times that man saved our lives.

1785
01:21:24.068 --> 01:21:25.896
The last time I
remember him was.

1786
01:21:25.931 --> 01:21:29.310
there was this huge explosion.

1787
01:21:29.344 --> 01:21:30.482
- You were there?

1788
01:21:30.517 --> 01:21:31.620
- Yeah. Yeah.

1789
01:21:31.655 --> 01:21:33.344
I was. I was right beside him.

1790
01:21:33.379 --> 01:21:35.034
It came outta nowhere.

1791
01:21:35.068 --> 01:21:37.482
And I tried to protect.
I wanted to protect him.

1792
01:21:37.517 --> 01:21:42.137
I tried. after the
explosion. I pulled him.

1793
01:21:42.172 --> 01:21:43.275
I pulled him out of the fire.

1794
01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:45.379
But I thought he had died.

1795
01:21:45.413 --> 01:21:48.896
And then almost immediately
after another bomb exploded

1796
01:21:48.931 --> 01:21:50.931
and we had to take cover and I-

1798
01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:55.172
I didn't want to leave him.

1799

I didn't wanna leave him.

1800
01:21:59.655 --> 01:22:03.482
I've carried that guilt.
Ever since that day.

1801
01:22:05.724 --> 01:22:07.344
- It was really bad and
he's never been the same.

1802
01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:15.586
But he credited some guy named
Big E for saving his life.

1803

- That was me.

- That was you?
- Yeah.

1806
01:22:26.620 --> 01:22:29.931
- So you brought him home
to me? You saved him?

[crying]

1808
01:22:40.241 --> 01:22:44.034
You know. we had a good
life for the most part.

1809
01:22:44.068 --> 01:22:48.413
But the depression just
took over and he just never.

1810
01:22:50.137 --> 01:22:53.103
I mean. just one day
he just took his life.

1811
01:22:53.137 --> 01:22:54.344
- I'm so sorry.

1812
01:23:01.172 --> 01:23:03.758
- You know. back then depression
was taboo in the community.

1813
01:23:03.793 --> 01:23:06.620
And I just wish I
knew more about it.

1814
01:23:06.655 --> 01:23:09.103
Maybe Sam would be
here with me today.

1815
01:23:09.137 --> 01:23:11.172
- I thought about going
to see somebody once.

1816
01:23:11.206 --> 01:23:12.551
but I. I don't know.

1817

I have seen so much.

Done so much.

1819
01:23:23.620 --> 01:23:24.655
I lost so much.

1820
01:23:26.103 --> 01:23:27.068
- I think it'll be worth it.

1821
01:23:30.517 --> 01:23:31.655
- I dunno.

01:28:57.517 --> 01:28:59.862
have been the greatest
honor of my life.

1922
01:29:01.517 --> 01:29:05.379
Every day I wake up with
you is a true blessing.

1923
01:29:07.965 --> 01:29:10.758
You have made me the
happiest man in the world.

1924
01:29:18.448 --> 01:29:23.103
Sweetheart will you do me the
honor of renewing our vows

1925
01:29:23.137 --> 01:29:27.965
with me and spending the
rest of your life with me?

1926
01:29:29.068 --> 01:29:31.000
My beautiful bride.

1927
01:29:31.034 --> 01:29:32.034
- I don't know what to say.

1928
01:29:33.758 --> 01:29:36.034
- Say yes.
[family laughing]

1929
01:29:36.068 --> 01:29:39.137
- But I thought-
- Stop. Stop.

1930
01:29:39.172 --> 01:29:40.034
Oh.

1931
01:29:42.758 --> 01:29:43.413
Sweetheart.

1932
01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.689
You know how important
our vows are to me.

1933
01:29:48.724 --> 01:29:53.517
- But when you were in
the office on the phone.

1934
01:29:54.620 --> 01:29:55.586
that conversation.

1935
01:29:55.620 --> 01:29:57.034
- Wait a minute. baby.

1936
01:29:57.068 --> 01:29:59.000
You were listening
to my conversation?

1937
01:29:59.034 --> 01:30:00.655
- [Sylvia] Yeah. I was.

1938
01:30:00.689 --> 01:30:02.413
I didn't even wanna tell
you what I was thinking.

1939
01:30:02.448 --> 01:30:05.000
but it really broke my heart.

1940
01:30:07.137 --> 01:30:08.000
- Sweetheart.

1941
01:30:09.448 --> 01:30:11.551
It was all a part of my plan

1942
01:30:11.586 --> 01:30:15.827
to keep the ring design a
secret with my jeweler. Gina.

1943
01:30:17.689 --> 01:30:20.137
Wait. man. you. you.
you didn't think...

1944
01:30:21.517 --> 01:30:22.448
- Ring designer?

1945
01:30:22.482 --> 01:30:23.758
- Yeah.

1946
01:30:24.758 --> 01:30:27.931
- Oh.
[wedding music]

1947
01:30:27.965 --> 01:30:29.896
Well. of course I'll
marry you again.

1948
01:30:29.931 --> 01:30:32.413
Over and over and over again.

1949
01:30:32.448 --> 01:30:35.103
You're such a wonderful
man. I love you.

1950
01:30:35.137 --> 01:30:36.655
Oh. yes. yes. I do.

1951
01:30:36.689 --> 01:30:37.827
I do. I will. I do.

1952

Well. I guess we got
our wedding to plan.

Christmas first though.

1955
01:30:47.448 --> 01:30:49.482
Oh. isn't that pretty?

1956
01:30:49.517 --> 01:30:50.379
- Mommy!

1957
01:30:52.206 --> 01:30:53.482
- Aw. that's so pretty.

1958
01:30:55.068 --> 01:30:56.034
Come on. Bryan.

1959
01:30:56.068 --> 01:30:57.689
Bring it in.

1960
01:30:57.724 --> 01:30:58.896
Bring it in. Bring it in.

1961
01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:01.827
- Ah.

1962
01:31:03.689 --> 01:31:05.586
- I always thought you was
something special. Bryan.

1963
01:31:05.620 --> 01:31:07.034
And I really mean that.

1964
01:31:07.068 --> 01:31:09.068
Because I didn't want to
have to kick your ass.

1965
01:31:23.172 --> 01:31:25.103
- I don't wanna interrupt
your celebration.

1966
01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:29.137
- I have one more
gift for you. Chris.

1967
01:31:29.172 --> 01:31:30.103
So wait.

1968
01:31:36.551 --> 01:31:38.586
Okay.

1969
01:31:38.620 --> 01:31:40.103
No. Come here. come here.

1970
01:31:40.137 --> 01:31:43.551
- [Chris] Okay.

1971
01:31:43.586 --> 01:31:44.448
Okay.

1972
01:31:53.827 --> 01:31:54.965
- A blue baby bottle?

1973
01:31:58.551 --> 01:31:59.206
Baby.

1974
01:32:01.068 --> 01:32:03.655
- Baby. are you.
are you. are we?

1975
01:32:05.206 --> 01:32:07.206
- Yes. baby. Yes.

1976
01:32:07.241 --> 01:32:11.206
This is what I've been trying
to tell you all weekend.

1977
01:32:11.241 --> 01:32:13.068
but you've been so
preoccupied with everything

1978
01:32:13.103 --> 01:32:14.068
that's been going on.

1979
01:32:14.103 --> 01:32:15.000
Listen.

1980
01:32:16.758 --> 01:32:21.551
Baby. you said that
God would bless us

1981
01:32:22.689 --> 01:32:23.137
when the time was right.

1982
01:32:25.724 --> 01:32:26.172
Well. baby.

Now they'll have
something else to focus on

1987
01:32:42.310 --> 01:32:43.275
when we go to college.
- Yes.

1988
01:32:44.896 --> 01:32:46.172
And listen. Chris. I know.

1989
01:32:48.620 --> 01:32:49.551
I know this means that we're
gonna be starting all over

1990
01:32:49.586 --> 01:32:51.000
and we are not young anymore.

1991
01:32:52.241 --> 01:32:53.103
So.

1992
01:32:55.655 --> 01:32:57.034
are you okay with this?

1993
01:32:57.068 --> 01:32:59.034
- Baby I'm more
than okay with it.

having a baby.

You're gonna be a big sister.
You're gonna be a big sister.

Excuse the wrapping.

Dennis called me earlier today
and said this is nothing.

2018
01:34:18.862 --> 01:34:21.068
We got two offers that are
worth way more than this.

2019
01:34:21.103 --> 01:34:22.241
This is our app. bro.

2020
01:34:22.275 --> 01:34:27.275
We did it.

The most important
thing is we did it. bro.
