This film is brought to you by the
Los Angeles CineFest Film Festival.

Festival and the Oh Scares Award.

5
00:01:17.458 --> 00:01:19.458
Have you ever wondered what happened to

6
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.750
Harry Pattern your favourite childhood Idol?

7
00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:26.458
Yes that's me.

8
00:01:37.458 --> 00:01:40.083
I played in a few other films like

9
00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:41.583
Averages

10
00:01:41.625 --> 00:01:43.458
A Hard Die remake.

11
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.833
Or John Wig.

12
00:02:02.708 --> 00:02:06.124
Hollywood asked me to be in a reboot but

13
00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:09.541
I'm old and audiences is need young

14
00:02:09.583 --> 00:02:12.916
energetic actors to play the lead not a

15
00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.541
bum like me.

16
00:02:36.416 --> 00:02:39.541
Recently I lost my wand.

17
00:02:39.583 --> 00:02:43.916
So I use anything I can find to create magic.

18
00:02:47.416 --> 00:02:49.291
Well let's try this pen

19
00:03:25.291 --> 00:03:28.124
I need to take a break from acting

20
00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:31.124
for many years I followed each story

21
00:03:31.166 --> 00:03:34.999
every single script and nobody asked me

22
00:03:35.041 --> 00:03:39.041
"Hey Harry do you have any stories to tell?"

23
00:03:39.291 --> 00:03:42.874
Nope no one asked me that

24
00:03:42.916 --> 00:03:44.833
I didn't have a chance to tell my

25
00:03:44.875 --> 00:03:48.291
stories to express what was in my mind.

26
00:03:49.833 --> 00:03:53.041
So I started to write.

27
00:03:57.541 --> 00:04:00.458
And I write a lot.

28
00:04:24.916 --> 00:04:26.291
Jessie?

29
00:04:26.333 --> 00:04:29.166

Lie.

33
00:04:36.583 --> 00:04:38.083
At Graceland.

34
00:04:38.291 --> 00:04:41.999
At Graceland I look like I was
the world's youngest elves fan oh

35
00:04:42.041 --> 00:04:42.833
Cheers to that.

36
00:04:43.041 --> 00:04:44.208
Cheers.

37
00:04:45.208 --> 00:04:47.083
Hmm.

38
00:04:48.416 --> 00:04:50.499
So Emerson said you go to a lot of

39
00:04:50.541 --> 00:04:53.249
concerts who's your favourite band?

40
00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:56.291
All time or like right now?

41
00:04:56.333 --> 00:04:59.499
Right now. Maybe "Wolf pack"

42
00:04:59.541 --> 00:05:02.166
I love them.

43
00:05:02.208 --> 00:05:04.749
Yeah? I just I just saw them when I

44
00:05:04.791 --> 00:05:06.041
was visiting friends in New York.

45
00:05:06.291 --> 00:05:07.499
No way where?

46
00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:09.791
Prospect Park

47
00:05:09.833 --> 00:05:11.416
I was at that show.

48
00:05:11.666 --> 00:05:13.916
What or the first or second night?

49
00:05:14.166 --> 00:05:15.041
Uh...

50
00:05:15.208 --> 00:05:17.874
it was it the one where the girl
ran up on stage and she changed.

51
00:05:17.916 --> 00:05:20.999
Insecurity tackled her oh my God yes.

52
00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:22.124
Yeah.

53
00:05:22.166 --> 00:05:25.916
That was insane.

54
00:05:26.083 --> 00:05:29.166
So we go and ring the doorbell her

55
00:05:29.208 --> 00:05:31.349
parents let us in out of the pouring rain

56
00:05:31.416 --> 00:05:33.166
and then my brother sees a picture on

57
00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:35.874
the mantle with the little girl in it

58
00:05:35.916 --> 00:05:37.166
No.

59
00:05:37.291 --> 00:05:38.874
And he goes

60
00:05:38.916 --> 00:05:41.041
that's her that's the girl we picked up

61
00:05:42.291 --> 00:05:44.999
And then the wife the she starts sobbing

62
00:05:45.041 --> 00:05:47.166
uncontrollably

63
00:05:47.208 --> 00:05:51.124
the husband he the husband says she died

64
00:05:51.166 --> 00:05:53.416
15 years ago

65
00:05:53.458 --> 00:05:57.166
then he takes his hand and puts it on my shoulder

66
00:05:57.208 --> 00:06:02.208
and he says this happens every year since

67
00:06:02.541 --> 00:06:04.041
Oh my God.

68
00:06:04.083 --> 00:06:05.583
On the day she died.

69
00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.999
I have chills

70
00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:12.541
look I feel like Goosebumps.

71
00:06:12.791 --> 00:06:13.916
You feel cold?

72
00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.083

So can I do this yet?

76

77
00:06:45.208 --> 00:06:46.041
Same.

Oh my God.

82
00:07:11.916 --> 00:07:14.791
Okay that's hilarious.

83
00:07:15.041 --> 00:07:16.416

84
00:07:16.666 --> 00:07:17.791

No it just got here.

87
00:07:22.208 --> 00:07:24.416
I can't believe you're wearing the shirt.

88
00:07:24.666 --> 00:07:28.166
I thing I love this shirt.

89
00:07:31.291 --> 00:07:35.208

French toast is 19 dollars.

97
00:07:54.916 --> 00:07:55.541
What?

98
00:08:01.291 --> 00:08:02.499

99
00:08:02.541 --> 00:08:06.291

101
00:08:08.791 --> 00:08:11.458
I don't know

103
00:08:22.583 --> 00:08:25.208
Drew?

104
00:08:25.291 --> 00:08:29.416

Master.

109
00:08:52.916 --> 00:08:54.041
Baiter.

110
00:08:58.208 --> 00:08:59.333
Morning wood.

111
00:09:02.416 --> 00:09:03.416
Oh my God.

112
00:09:14.833 --> 00:09:16.666
I put the art in fart.

113
00:09:17.041 --> 00:09:18.666
What the ffff...?

114
00:09:20.166 --> 00:09:21.041
You found one?

115
00:09:30.541 --> 00:09:33.333
Jesse?

116
00:09:34.041 --> 00:09:37.291
I forgot everything at work I gotta go

117
00:09:39.884 --> 00:09:43.041
Every single one

118
00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:45.291
not even a plain white tea? I thought I

119
00:09:45.333 --> 00:09:47.291
found one and then I unfolded it and

120
00:09:47.333 --> 00:09:49.416
there were cartoon pubes drawn on the

121
00:09:49.458 --> 00:09:51.958
bottom. That's pretty funny.

122
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.291
Thatâ€™s not funny. It's insane.

123
00:09:54.333 --> 00:09:56.166
Why don't you just ask him about it?

124
00:09:56.333 --> 00:09:58.083
I panicked I just left.

125
00:09:58.291 --> 00:10:01.291
Are you sure this isn't another
classic Jessie move where

126
00:10:01.333 --> 00:10:03.916
you you know find the flaw in an

127
00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.999
otherwise perfect guy? he had at least at

128
00:10:06.041 --> 00:10:08.541
least four shirts with the word suck on them.

129
00:10:11.041 --> 00:10:13.291
Okay I'm just saying you did dump a guy

130
00:10:13.333 --> 00:10:15.916
once because he wore cufflinks? they're

131
00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.291
strangely formal it's like wrist

132
00:10:17.333 --> 00:10:18.499
hearings

133
00:10:18.541 --> 00:10:20.999
didn't you say he was an ER doctor who

134
00:10:21.041 --> 00:10:23.499
helped uninsured children? yeah and after

135
00:10:23.541 --> 00:10:25.291
your first date you said you had never

136
00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:27.291
felt so close to another person so

137
00:10:27.333 --> 00:10:28.041
quickly.

138
00:10:28.333 --> 00:10:29.416
You said that.

139
00:10:32.916 --> 00:10:33.583
and

140
00:10:35.916 --> 00:10:37.291
wolf pack

141
00:10:37.333 --> 00:10:40.208
ugh... I know.

142
00:10:40.333 --> 00:10:41.541
Wolf pack.

143
00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.333
maybe you're right

144
00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.916
just go talk to the guy

145
00:10:54.291 --> 00:10:55.666
I'm glad you called.

146
00:10:56.458 --> 00:10:59.041
I'm excited to finally be able to cook for you.

147
00:11:04.291 --> 00:11:06.249
Can I talk to you about something?

148
00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:07.333
Yeah what's up

149
00:11:08.333 --> 00:11:12.333
With all these dirty joke shirts?

150
00:11:12.416 --> 00:11:14.291
It's all you wear.

151
00:11:14.333 --> 00:11:16.916
yeah they're hilarious

152
00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.083
are they?

153
00:11:21.291 --> 00:11:22.249
I don't know

154
00:11:23.333 --> 00:11:25.416
I spend my day in Scrub's operating on

155
00:11:25.458 --> 00:11:27.374
kids

156
00:11:27.416 --> 00:11:28.999
sometimes I have to tell their parents

157
00:11:29.041 --> 00:11:31.166
they didn't make it

158
00:11:31.208 --> 00:11:32.083
it's a lot

159
00:11:35.208 --> 00:11:37.249
so when I get a chance to wear some

160
00:11:37.291 --> 00:11:40.166
street clothes I guess I like to have a

161
00:11:40.208 --> 00:11:41.999
little fun with it

162
00:11:42.041 --> 00:11:43.999
Oh..

163
00:11:44.041 --> 00:11:47.291
that's actually so so sweet

164
00:11:47.333 --> 00:11:48.583
I'm an asshole.

165
00:11:51.416 --> 00:11:53.333
I'm glad we talked about this.

166
00:11:53.666 --> 00:11:55.041
I'm glad you're here.

167
00:11:58.333 --> 00:12:00.208
Bon appetite.

168
00:12:00.333 --> 00:12:01.458
Uh...

169
00:12:37.333 --> 00:12:39.000
I can't do this.

170
00:12:44.041 --> 00:12:46.999
Each day seems to be the same I wake up

171
00:12:47.041 --> 00:12:50.083
I drink some mushroom coffee and I go

172
00:12:50.125 --> 00:12:51.041
for a walk

173
00:12:54.291 --> 00:12:56.999
The only difference is that each day a

174
00:12:57.041 --> 00:12:58.250
different dog barks at me

175
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.791
But I want to be remembered

176
00:13:50.833 --> 00:13:52.000
as a good guy

177
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:53.833
hmm

178
00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:55.291
I need to think about it

179
00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:01.291
Meanwhile let's finish this story

180
00:15:11.166 --> 00:15:13.000

So Gareth

291
00:21:03.375 --> 00:21:05.958
Alexandra

292
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.124
I heard you study philosophy.

293
00:21:09.166 --> 00:21:12.166
What got you hooked?

294
00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:13.249
The

295
00:21:13.291 --> 00:21:15.083
this might sound a little bit weird but

296
00:21:15.125 --> 00:21:17.124
when I was in kindergarten I was

297
00:21:17.166 --> 00:21:19.749
diagnosed with ADHD it's made me think

298
00:21:19.791 --> 00:21:21.124
and feel differently from the other kids

299
00:21:21.166 --> 00:21:24.208
in my grade this inspired me to sort of

300
00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:26.333
figure out why the world made me this

301
00:21:26.375 --> 00:21:27.249
way

302
00:21:27.291 --> 00:21:30.124
one of the benefits of having ADHD other

303
00:21:30.166 --> 00:21:31.958
than being really hyper is that you get

304
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.749
fixated on these things

305
00:21:34.791 --> 00:21:36.749
small things I got fixed on reading

306
00:21:36.791 --> 00:21:39.749
books different books about different

307
00:21:39.791 --> 00:21:41.208
people's views on the world and it sort

308
00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:43.374
of made me realise like Jim Morrison

309
00:21:43.416 --> 00:21:46.208
would say that I was

310
00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:48.124
thrown into the world this way which

311
00:21:48.166 --> 00:21:52.208
made it my destiny to be a philosopher

312
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:54.375
what about you Alex?

313
00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:57.333
what do you study? I'm sorry if I'm overwhelming you too

314
00:21:57.375 --> 00:21:59.708

I go to York for psych

318
00:22:10.041 --> 00:22:12.083
I guess to why I chose a screw path

319
00:22:12.125 --> 00:22:13.124
that's because you only needed to see in

320
00:22:13.166 --> 00:22:15.124
high school to get in but I'm in a

321
00:22:15.166 --> 00:22:18.125

Sorry I yeah don't be I understand why

384

00:26:00.125 --> 00:26:03.166

I'm sorry for yelling I'm sorry for

00:26:06.166 --> 00:26:10.124
making a mess I'm fine I am

393
00:26:10.166 --> 00:26:13.124
I yell and I spill drinks all the

394
00:26:13.166 --> 00:26:14.833
fucking time I just don't think this is

395
00:26:14.875 --> 00:26:16.208
gonna work

396
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.083

397
00:26:22.125 --> 00:26:25.124

00:26:25.166 --> 00:26:28.833

00:26:28.875 --> 00:26:31.124
I'm really sorry

400
00:26:31.166 --> 00:26:33.124
I hope you have a great

401
00:26:33.166 --> 00:26:35.916
meal.

402
00:26:55.166 --> 00:26:56.166
Hey.

403
00:26:57.166 --> 00:26:59.750
Hey

404
00:28:24.016 --> 00:28:28.749
no it's just stupid a flammable dildo?

405
00:28:28.791 --> 00:28:30.791
Children are probably going to watch

406
00:28:30.833 --> 00:28:32.416
this

407
00:28:32.458 --> 00:28:36.291
noooo... I need to write something else

408
00:28:36.333 --> 00:28:39.499
when you hear anorexic I know what you

409
00:28:39.541 --> 00:28:43.499
think young girl teens maybe early 20s

410
00:28:43.541 --> 00:28:46.749
definitely Rich parents that beg her to

411
00:28:46.791 --> 00:28:49.249
eat dinner and when she won't they cry

412
00:28:49.291 --> 00:28:51.666
and group hug and check her into a posh

413
00:28:51.708 --> 00:28:54.374
rehab where she meets other Rich Young

414
00:28:54.416 --> 00:28:56.541
equally dark and quirky people and they

415
00:28:56.583 --> 00:28:58.874
do shit like goat yoga and Equine

416
00:28:58.916 --> 00:29:00.791
Therapy all fucking day then she

417
00:29:00.833 --> 00:29:03.249
Instagrams her thigh gap and hashtags it

418
00:29:03.291 --> 00:29:05.708
with things like size double zero skinny

419
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:09.874
fat Anna Mia thinspo ugly and self-hate

420
00:29:09.916 --> 00:29:12.749
maybe in a lifetime movie none of that's

421
00:29:12.791 --> 00:29:13.666
me

422
00:29:13.708 --> 00:29:16.499
Okay maybe the Instagram thing only when

423
00:29:16.541 --> 00:29:19.624
I need reassurance but otherwise not me

424
00:29:19.666 --> 00:29:22.666
your grateful narrator is definitely not

425
00:29:22.708 --> 00:29:23.666
rich

426
00:29:23.708 --> 00:29:26.499
in fact I'm super late on my rent right

427
00:29:26.541 --> 00:29:28.666
now which is really pathetic because I

428
00:29:28.708 --> 00:29:30.499
just live in a shitty room I found on

429
00:29:30.541 --> 00:29:32.416
Craigslist in this house owned by a

430
00:29:32.458 --> 00:29:34.249
creepy old dude who looks like he wants

431
00:29:34.291 --> 00:29:36.874
to rape me or eat me with a glass of

432
00:29:36.916 --> 00:29:38.791
Chianti

433
00:29:38.833 --> 00:29:40.749
I know what you're thinking

434
00:29:40.791 --> 00:29:43.458
she doesn't look anorexic she's way too

435
00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:44.916
fucking fat

436
00:29:44.958 --> 00:29:47.666
well I'm in recovery asshole so how

437
00:29:47.708 --> 00:29:49.249
about a little support

438
00:29:49.291 --> 00:29:52.666
but I am a starving artist ah pun

439
00:29:52.708 --> 00:29:53.666
intended

440
00:29:53.708 --> 00:29:56.499
so it's totally acceptable to be poor

441
00:29:56.541 --> 00:30:01.249
and spottily employed at 24 25.

442
00:30:01.291 --> 00:30:04.624
Okay 26 to 36 it's probably a good thing

443
00:30:04.666 --> 00:30:06.791
I've had to struggle so much you know it

444
00:30:06.833 --> 00:30:10.499
makes me a richer actor builds character

445
00:30:10.541 --> 00:30:12.666
it's going to happen for me soon though

446
00:30:12.708 --> 00:30:13.749
I know it

447
00:30:13.791 --> 00:30:17.624
I'm a very positive optimistic person

448
00:30:17.666 --> 00:30:19.041
and I'm not one of those actresses who's

449
00:30:19.083 --> 00:30:20.666
never done anything

450
00:30:20.708 --> 00:30:22.874
I was just on three episodes of a

451
00:30:22.916 --> 00:30:26.291
relatively successful web series

452
00:30:26.333 --> 00:30:28.666
it sucks because I'm five foot eight and

453
00:30:28.708 --> 00:30:30.874
a quarter so my weight never sounds

454
00:30:30.916 --> 00:30:33.666
skinny no matter what my best weight was

455
00:30:33.708 --> 00:30:36.541
106 which was really an accomplishment

456
00:30:36.583 --> 00:30:38.291
but unfortunately it doesn't sound very

457
00:30:38.333 --> 00:30:40.874
dramatic everybody flipped when the

458
00:30:40.916 --> 00:30:43.499
Olsen twins got down to like 80 pounds

459
00:30:43.541 --> 00:30:46.249
but they're wet maybe five feet tall and

460
00:30:46.291 --> 00:30:47.666
it's five pounds for every inch so

461
00:30:47.708 --> 00:30:49.874
comparatively I'd be equivalent to their

462
00:30:49.916 --> 00:30:52.874
80 pound alleged skinniness at 120

463
00:30:52.916 --> 00:30:55.749
pounds so unfair why am I weighing

464
00:30:55.791 --> 00:30:58.874
myself if I'm supposed to be in recovery

465
00:30:58.916 --> 00:31:01.666
of course I weigh myself every day how

466
00:31:01.708 --> 00:31:02.874
else are you supposed to know how you're

467
00:31:02.916 --> 00:31:04.791
going to feel about yourself that day

468
00:31:04.833 --> 00:31:08.749
totally kidding I know my value is not a

469
00:31:08.791 --> 00:31:10.749
number on the scale blah blah

470
00:31:10.791 --> 00:31:12.666
mother fucking blah

471
00:31:12.708 --> 00:31:16.249
so anyway not to worry your big boned

472
00:31:16.291 --> 00:31:18.666
narrator has got her shit together

473
00:31:18.708 --> 00:31:21.291
oh that's Mandy she wanted to walk with

474
00:31:21.333 --> 00:31:22.499
me today

475
00:31:22.541 --> 00:31:23.666
should I wait?

476
00:31:23.708 --> 00:31:26.666
Oh she'll catch up. So Mandy and our

477
00:31:26.708 --> 00:31:28.666
other friend Shelly and me were all best

478
00:31:28.708 --> 00:31:30.666
friends in high school but they were the

479
00:31:30.708 --> 00:31:32.749
popular cheerleaders National Honor

480
00:31:32.791 --> 00:31:35.666
Society life at the parties I was the

481
00:31:35.708 --> 00:31:37.499
third wheel who always got a little too

482
00:31:37.541 --> 00:31:38.916
drunk at the parties and everything that

483
00:31:38.958 --> 00:31:40.499
came with that

484
00:31:40.541 --> 00:31:42.249
they were supposed to have peaked in

485
00:31:42.291 --> 00:31:44.416
high school I believed those after

486
00:31:44.458 --> 00:31:45.749
school specials that told me things

487
00:31:45.791 --> 00:31:47.749
would get better after high school when

488
00:31:47.791 --> 00:31:49.666
I could be my real self

489
00:31:49.708 --> 00:31:51.624
but everything keeps working out for

490
00:31:51.666 --> 00:31:52.624
them

491
00:31:52.666 --> 00:31:54.249
Fuck. Maybe I'm the one who peaked in

492
00:31:54.291 --> 00:31:56.541
high school nope nope no more feeling

493
00:31:56.583 --> 00:31:58.708
sorry for myself I promise

494
00:32:01.041 --> 00:32:03.416
oh I already ate

495
00:32:03.458 --> 00:32:05.916
Lizzy you look great which obviously

496
00:32:05.958 --> 00:32:07.749
means I look fat I guess I don't really

497
00:32:07.791 --> 00:32:09.749
worry about it anymore

498
00:32:09.791 --> 00:32:14.416
380 maybe 400 calories in a slice

499
00:32:14.458 --> 00:32:17.666
200 for half wine 140 calories of glass

500
00:32:17.708 --> 00:32:20.833
there's vodka in my room 65 calories a shot

501
00:32:25.541 --> 00:32:27.416
You are so lucky to be single

502
00:32:27.458 --> 00:32:29.666
you don't have someone checking on you

503
00:32:29.708 --> 00:32:32.541
every five minutes yeah renting a room

504
00:32:32.583 --> 00:32:35.499
from creepy Chianti Craigslist's guys way better.

505
00:32:35.541 --> 00:32:37.749
So. Have you gotten a job yet?

506
00:32:37.791 --> 00:32:39.666
I know you're still doing the acting thing

507
00:32:39.708 --> 00:32:41.624
but I mean like a job job

508
00:32:41.666 --> 00:32:44.833
I'm sorry did I order judgment on my pizza?

509
00:32:44.875 --> 00:32:47.416
Yeah I have a lot of leads

510
00:32:47.458 --> 00:32:49.624

511
00:32:49.666 --> 00:32:52.374
what's it like being a mom just get past

512
00:32:52.416 --> 00:32:54.874
the pizza be stronger than the pizza

513
00:32:54.916 --> 00:32:57.666
another glass of wine is better it's in

514
00:32:57.708 --> 00:32:59.666
vodka if I need it

515
00:32:59.708 --> 00:33:01.791
not gonna lie

516
00:33:01.833 --> 00:33:04.666
but it is just

517
00:33:04.708 --> 00:33:08.374
so 400 plus one of the most amazing 270

518
00:33:08.416 --> 00:33:12.749
or 280 plus BMR of about 13.50 so 2150

519
00:33:12.791 --> 00:33:14.666
burned so

520
00:33:14.708 --> 00:33:16.624
um have you been on Instagram today?

521
00:33:16.666 --> 00:33:18.666
No.

522
00:33:18.708 --> 00:33:20.291
Why?

523
00:33:20.333 --> 00:33:21.541
Okay

524
00:33:21.583 --> 00:33:23.666
I'm gonna tell you something but I don't

525
00:33:23.708 --> 00:33:24.749
want you to go on one of your downward

526
00:33:24.791 --> 00:33:26.291
spirals

527
00:33:26.333 --> 00:33:27.666
then maybe you shouldn't say it like

528
00:33:27.708 --> 00:33:29.291
that

529
00:33:29.333 --> 00:33:31.541
Shelley booked a series regular on TV.

530
00:33:31.583 --> 00:33:33.791
No fucking way. Wow.

531
00:33:35.708 --> 00:33:37.666
you both have been doing this a really

532
00:33:37.708 --> 00:33:39.708
long time so you know how hard that is

533
00:33:42.708 --> 00:33:46.874
or that entitled lucky ass bitch can go fuck herself.

534
00:33:46.916 --> 00:33:50.499
Of course of course

535
00:33:50.541 --> 00:33:52.749
of course doesn't that give you some

536
00:33:52.791 --> 00:33:54.666
sort of Hope

537
00:33:54.708 --> 00:33:56.541
you guys have the same agent right

538
00:33:57.708 --> 00:34:00.374
Yes we have the same fucking agent.

539
00:34:00.416 --> 00:34:02.666
Why would he get Shelly that audition

540
00:34:02.708 --> 00:34:03.916
and not me?

541
00:34:03.958 --> 00:34:05.874
She's not fucking cankles

542
00:34:05.916 --> 00:34:07.666
he probably wants to fuck her

543
00:34:07.708 --> 00:34:10.666
or he wants to fuck with my head

544
00:34:10.708 --> 00:34:12.666
of course he's still mad at
me from what

545
00:34:12.708 --> 00:34:14.666
I know showed that one audition that was

546
00:34:14.708 --> 00:34:16.666
totally not my fault

547
00:34:16.708 --> 00:34:19.249
he's a psychological ninja gaslighting

548
00:34:19.291 --> 00:34:20.791
narcissistic motherfucker. Elizabeth

549
00:34:22.708 --> 00:34:24.791
you're bloated struggling narrator is

550
00:34:24.833 --> 00:34:26.499
sick of everybody emotionally

551
00:34:26.541 --> 00:34:27.666
waterboarding her

552
00:34:34.958 --> 00:34:36.666
You might think I'm crazy for riding

553
00:34:36.708 --> 00:34:40.666
alone at 2:30 in the morning but I'm not

554
00:34:40.708 --> 00:34:43.541
what else am I supposed to do

555
00:34:43.583 --> 00:34:45.874
I'm not one of those people that says

556
00:34:45.916 --> 00:34:47.666
I'll start tomorrow

557
00:34:47.708 --> 00:34:49.749
that's how 70 percent of Americans got

558
00:34:49.791 --> 00:34:51.666
to be overweight or obese

559
00:34:52.916 --> 00:34:54.666
I know I'm not worried about anybody

560
00:34:54.708 --> 00:34:56.749
attacking me or anything I'm so fat and

561
00:34:56.791 --> 00:34:58.624
gross right now nobody's gonna try to

562
00:34:58.666 --> 00:35:00.749
rape me

563
00:35:00.791 --> 00:35:03.416
right now you're probably thinking I

564
00:35:03.458 --> 00:35:06.666
look like a hopeless whiny pitiful mess

565
00:35:06.708 --> 00:35:08.666
maybe you can't stand me right now maybe

566
00:35:08.708 --> 00:35:11.666
you're like can she fucking shut up.

567
00:35:11.708 --> 00:35:12.624
I get it

568
00:35:12.666 --> 00:35:15.249
I completely fucking agree

569
00:35:15.291 --> 00:35:17.916
you're worthless fat ass narrator knows

570
00:35:17.958 --> 00:35:20.583
exactly how shitty of a person she is

571
00:36:09.666 --> 00:36:14.416
You know how some time you
have one bite and you just can't stop

572
00:36:14.458 --> 00:36:15.666
I guess that's kind of what happened

573
00:36:15.708 --> 00:36:17.666
last night

574
00:36:17.708 --> 00:36:20.249
but don't worry you're self-deprecating

575
00:36:20.291 --> 00:36:21.874
narrator has got it totally under

576
00:36:21.916 --> 00:36:23.874
control

577
00:36:23.916 --> 00:36:27.374
I just need to outrun my fuck up just

578
00:36:27.416 --> 00:36:30.791
not eat today then I will be healthy and

579
00:36:30.833 --> 00:36:33.416
optimistic and positive and shit.

580
00:36:33.458 --> 00:36:34.624
I will

581
00:36:34.666 --> 00:36:36.458
I'll I'll start tomorrow

582
00:37:05.541 --> 00:37:06.499
Yeah...

583
00:37:06.541 --> 00:37:11.041
Lord Voldemort on the toilet that could work

584
00:37:11.083 --> 00:37:14.666
but how am I going to hide his nose?

585
00:37:14.708 --> 00:37:17.749
Also he needs to be shaved

586
00:37:17.791 --> 00:37:18.833
anyway

587
00:37:19.041 --> 00:37:20.666
Uh...

588
00:37:20.833 --> 00:37:23.499
that was something

589
00:37:23.541 --> 00:37:25.999
I didn't know I could write so many

590
00:37:26.041 --> 00:37:28.999
stories in less than an hour it has the

591
00:37:29.041 --> 00:37:31.291
potential to be a nice

592
00:37:31.333 --> 00:37:34.458
pattern the brain not only receives

593
00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:37.083
information but also interprets and

594
00:37:37.125 --> 00:37:41.624
patterns it I can tell I'm pleased with

595
00:37:41.666 --> 00:37:42.791
myself

596
00:37:42.833 --> 00:37:46.458
oh shit. I knew I should have drunk five

597
00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:49.499
mushroom coffees in her own time will

598
00:37:49.541 --> 00:37:51.458
not slow down when something unpleasant

599
00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:53.833
lies at the bottom of your stomach.

600
00:37:54.458 --> 00:37:58.791
I'll finish the other characters some other time.
