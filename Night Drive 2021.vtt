- Russell.
- Hey. Russ.

15
00:00:56.164 --> 00:00:57.631
How long you been driving
for Jaunt?

16
00:00:57.665 --> 00:00:59.101
Oh. it's been around
eight months.

17
00:00:59.134 --> 00:01:00.569
Oh.

18
00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:01.702
Got a little on the beard.

19
00:01:09.077 --> 00:01:10.412
You could just set it
right there.

20
00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:11.847
I'm gonna put it up
in a little bit.

21
00:01:14.681 --> 00:01:16.117
- You hangin' on that door?
- Yeah.

22
00:01:16.151 --> 00:01:17.786
I thought it would look festive.

23
00:01:17.818 --> 00:01:19.153
Really festive.

24
00:01:20.187 --> 00:01:21.756
I really appreciate your help.

25
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.859
Don't worry about it.
Merry Christmas.

26
00:01:26.127 --> 00:01:27.127
Thanks.

27
00:02:41.535 --> 00:02:42.637
Charlotte?

28
00:02:42.937 --> 00:02:44.473
Who's asking?

29
00:02:44.505 --> 00:02:47.943
Uh. you called for a Jaunt.
right?

30
00:02:47.975 --> 00:02:49.510
- Russell?
- That's right.

31
00:02:58.018 --> 00:03:02.890
Do you have any water
or lollies or anything?

32
00:03:02.924 --> 00:03:05.125
Okay. I've got some gum maybe.

33
00:03:05.158 --> 00:03:07.194
How how'd you get a 4.9
without the goodies?

34
00:03:08.428 --> 00:03:10.140
You might not be able to tell
from the back of my head.

35
00:03:10.164 --> 00:03:12.234
but I'm charming as heck.

36
00:03:12.266 --> 00:03:13.901
We'll see about that.

37
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:16.204
You're goin' to Atwater Village?

38
00:03:16.236 --> 00:03:17.271
Yep.

39
00:03:17.305 --> 00:03:19.641
Any route you want me
to take or follow the GPS?

40
00:03:20.641 --> 00:03:21.942
Dealer's choice.

41
00:03:21.975 --> 00:03:23.044
You got it.

42
00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.594
Music? No music.

43
00:03:39.627 --> 00:03:41.663
I have a USB if you wanna
play your own stuff.

44
00:03:41.695 --> 00:03:43.898
- Do people actually do that?
- Play their own stuff?

45
00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:45.133
Yeah.

46
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.767
Not really.

47
00:03:46.801 --> 00:03:47.903
That's too bad.

48
00:03:48.802 --> 00:03:49.704
I feel like it'd be interesting.
you know.

49
00:03:49.737 --> 00:03:51.181
like. hearing all the
embarrassing shit

50
00:03:51.205 --> 00:03:52.974
that comes on shuffle
on people's phones.

51
00:03:53.006 --> 00:03:53.908
Oh yeah.

52
00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:55.611
It'd be like
a sociological experiment.

53
00:03:56.811 --> 00:03:58.046
You should try it.

54
00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.948
You wanna be
my first test subject?

55
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.549
Fuck. no.

56
00:04:01.582 --> 00:04:03.250
Can I already tell you
what mine would be?

57
00:04:03.283 --> 00:04:04.652
What's that?

58
00:04:04.686 --> 00:04:06.855
"Yellow" by Coldplay.

59
00:04:06.887 --> 00:04:08.856
Sorry.

60
00:04:10.925 --> 00:04:13.761
How old are you.
if you don't mind me asking?

61
00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:14.896
I don't mind.

62
00:04:14.928 --> 00:04:16.664
What year are we in again?

63
00:04:16.698 --> 00:04:18.633
2018.

64
00:04:20.167 --> 00:04:22.236
I'm 22.

65
00:04:23.236 --> 00:04:24.306
And you?

66
00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:26.575
How old do you think I am?

67
00:04:26.608 --> 00:04:28.577
Uh. 5...

68
00:04:29.876 --> 00:04:31.612
You're like. 55.

69
00:04:31.645 --> 00:04:32.746
55?

70
00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.815
Hey. the front of your head
is much more charming

71
00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:35.717
than the back of it.

72
00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.185
Thanks.

73
00:04:37.851 --> 00:04:40.255
<i>My uncle uses Just For Men.
Good stuff.</i>

74
00:04:40.287 --> 00:04:42.157
<i>- Ugh.
- Highly recommended.</i>

75
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.593
<i>This is going to be a long ride.</i>

76
00:04:44.625 --> 00:04:47.294
Oh. God. you're so sensitive!

77
00:04:47.327 --> 00:04:49.029
Are you an actor or something?

78
00:04:49.063 --> 00:04:50.731
Not even close.

79
00:04:50.765 --> 00:04:52.134
Huh.

80
00:05:05.212 --> 00:05:07.282
Shit. Um. do you think
you could wait for me

81
00:05:07.315 --> 00:05:09.150
outside my next destination

82
00:05:09.183 --> 00:05:10.919
and I'll just run in.
I'll be five minutes.

83
00:05:10.952 --> 00:05:12.387
- I'll come right back out?
- Sure.

84
00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:15.089
Yeah um.
you just need to go in the app.

85
00:05:15.123 --> 00:05:17.392
type in the next destination.
it's on the um...

86
00:05:17.424 --> 00:05:20.127
You can't just like wait
for me like five minutes?

87
00:05:20.161 --> 00:05:24.032
Yeah. yeah. you just...
if you wanna go somewhere else.

88
00:05:24.065 --> 00:05:28.937
you go into the app.
you type the next place in.

89
00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:31.039
I really don't wanna
work that hard.

90
00:05:34.275 --> 00:05:35.375
We cool?

91
00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:37.811
Yeah. Yeah. yeah. yeah.
take as long as you need.

92
00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:52.827
Actually. you know...

93
00:05:52.859 --> 00:05:56.263
I do have a Christmas party.
sort of a...

94
00:05:58.065 --> 00:05:59.868
Like a friend
from my last gig kinda thing.

95
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.145
- it starts around 9:00.
- Mm-hmm.

96
00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:02.137
Nine-ish.

97
00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:06.106
So I don't know where
you need to go tonight.

98
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.409
but I told him that I might...

99
00:06:10.977 --> 00:06:12.413
Cancel?

100
00:06:14.214 --> 00:06:15.814
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

101
00:06:16.851 --> 00:06:18.020
Yeah.

102
00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:36.138
<i>Just tell me where it is.</i>

103
00:06:37.171 --> 00:06:38.774
<i>It's this house right here.</i>

104
00:06:51.818 --> 00:06:53.455
- Okay. so you'll just wait here?
- Yeah.

105
00:06:53.488 --> 00:06:55.023
I'll be in and out.

106
00:06:55.056 --> 00:06:55.890
Perfect.

107
00:06:55.924 --> 00:06:58.392
- Car stays running?
- Yeah.

108
00:06:58.426 --> 00:06:59.895
Okay.

109
00:07:02.162 --> 00:07:03.964
Don't leave.

110
00:07:43.104 --> 00:07:45.240
Go. go. go. go!

111
00:07:49.443 --> 00:07:51.813
Hey man. watch it.

112
00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:53.481
<i>Charlotte!</i>

113
00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:56.450
Who the fuck is this guy?

114
00:07:56.484 --> 00:07:57.919
Charlotte.

115
00:07:57.952 --> 00:07:58.653
Open... Oh!

116
00:07:58.686 --> 00:08:00.255
No. no. no. no. no. no. no. no!

117
00:08:00.287 --> 00:08:01.222
Charlotte!

118
00:08:01.255 --> 00:08:03.258
Pedal to the fucking metal!

119
00:08:13.568 --> 00:08:17.104
Oh. you fucking bitch.

120
00:08:24.044 --> 00:08:26.013
Jesus Christ. are you all right?

121
00:08:26.046 --> 00:08:27.181
Fucking prick.

122
00:08:27.214 --> 00:08:28.549
That guy hit you?

123
00:08:28.582 --> 00:08:31.186
Yeah. he's an arsehole.

124
00:08:35.155 --> 00:08:37.195
- You want me to take you to a police station?
- No.

125
00:08:39.293 --> 00:08:40.861
But I do need a drink.

126
00:09:17.298 --> 00:09:19.333
Thanks.

127
00:09:20.568 --> 00:09:22.135
To world peace.

128
00:09:22.169 --> 00:09:23.169
Okay.

129
00:09:32.145 --> 00:09:33.448
Do you come here a lot?

130
00:09:33.481 --> 00:09:34.414
Here?

131
00:09:34.448 --> 00:09:35.448
No.

132
00:09:36.082 --> 00:09:37.251
Atwater?

133
00:09:37.284 --> 00:09:38.285
Yes.

134
00:09:38.319 --> 00:09:41.421
I uh. used to share
some office space out here

135
00:09:41.454 --> 00:09:43.223
in my previous life.

136
00:09:43.256 --> 00:09:44.592
That's funny.

137
00:09:44.625 --> 00:09:46.502
People usually think
they're like Mozart or Napoleon

138
00:09:46.526 --> 00:09:48.528
in their past life. but you...

139
00:09:48.562 --> 00:09:50.932
You shared an office space
in Atwater.

140
00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:52.433
No. Not...

141
00:09:52.466 --> 00:09:55.036
Not a past life. jeez.
that would be depressing.

142
00:09:55.068 --> 00:09:58.139
No. my uh. previous life
before driving.

143
00:10:00.573 --> 00:10:02.142
What about you?

144
00:10:03.177 --> 00:10:05.647
Probably Claudette Colbert.

145
00:10:05.679 --> 00:10:07.448
She died the day I was born.

146
00:10:09.216 --> 00:10:12.253
No. do you come
to Atwater a lot?

147
00:10:12.285 --> 00:10:13.654
Sure.

148
00:10:13.688 --> 00:10:16.258
That was my ex's place.
in case you couldn't tell.

149
00:10:18.558 --> 00:10:19.993
Seems like kind of a dick.

150
00:10:20.026 --> 00:10:21.395
Kinda.

151
00:10:25.231 --> 00:10:27.000
So what did you do
in this previous.

152
00:10:27.034 --> 00:10:28.436
- Atwater life of yours?
- Hmm?

153
00:10:28.468 --> 00:10:29.570
Oh. um.

154
00:10:31.271 --> 00:10:33.507
tech. you know.
development stuff.

155
00:10:34.475 --> 00:10:35.343
Sounds boring.

156
00:10:35.375 --> 00:10:37.645
You know.
that travel app Far Away?

157
00:10:37.678 --> 00:10:39.212
Yeah.

158
00:10:39.246 --> 00:10:40.515
I developed that.

159
00:10:40.548 --> 00:10:42.250
- Bullshit.
- I did.

160
00:10:42.283 --> 00:10:43.985
Give me my 5 hundy back.

161
00:10:44.018 --> 00:10:44.986
Hell no.

162
00:10:45.019 --> 00:10:47.221
What? You just do this
driving shit for fun?

163
00:10:47.254 --> 00:10:48.389
No.

164
00:10:48.422 --> 00:10:49.724
I uh...

165
00:10:50.857 --> 00:10:53.527
I let my partner buy me out
before they went public.

166
00:10:54.996 --> 00:10:57.198
That explains the sweet ride.

167
00:10:57.231 --> 00:10:59.667
Yeah.
I got that after the buyout.

168
00:10:59.699 --> 00:11:02.369
Probably not the smartest way
to drop 70K.

169
00:11:03.203 --> 00:11:05.640
Hindsight's 20/20
and all that jazz. I guess.

170
00:11:07.007 --> 00:11:08.442
You're still a zygote.

171
00:11:09.577 --> 00:11:12.447
Someday. you'll look back
at that one moment

172
00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.649
where you picked the path
of least resistance

173
00:11:14.682 --> 00:11:18.219
and everything
just went to shit.

174
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.256
But I hope I'm wrong.

175
00:11:22.655 --> 00:11:24.092
You know what they say about uh.

176
00:11:24.125 --> 00:11:26.626
choosing the road less traveled?

177
00:11:26.659 --> 00:11:28.163
They are probably right.

178
00:11:30.063 --> 00:11:33.601
Anyway. sorry. you paid for fun.

179
00:11:33.634 --> 00:11:35.103
So what about you?

180
00:11:35.135 --> 00:11:37.105
How'd you wind up out here?
You're from...

181
00:11:37.138 --> 00:11:38.473
- Australia.
- Right.

182
00:11:38.505 --> 00:11:39.674
Actress or something?

183
00:11:39.707 --> 00:11:41.241
Or something.

184
00:11:42.143 --> 00:11:44.379
- Any family out here?
- No.

185
00:11:44.411 --> 00:11:45.654
Going back there
for the holidays?

186
00:11:45.678 --> 00:11:47.548
There isn't really a there
to go back to.

187
00:11:47.581 --> 00:11:50.585
Um. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

188
00:11:50.617 --> 00:11:52.419
Don't you get tired
of hearing people talk

189
00:11:52.452 --> 00:11:54.054
about themselves all day?

190
00:11:55.356 --> 00:11:58.326
Well. it's better
than hearing myself prattle on

191
00:11:58.358 --> 00:11:59.659
for eight hours a day.

192
00:11:59.693 --> 00:12:02.096
answering the same
five questions.

193
00:12:02.129 --> 00:12:03.531
"How long have you
been doing this?"

194
00:12:03.563 --> 00:12:05.433
"Do you do other drive shares?"

195
00:12:05.466 --> 00:12:07.635
Uh. "What's the furthest out
you've had to drive?"

196
00:12:07.668 --> 00:12:10.371
- Where is the furthest out you've had to drive?
- Coachella.

197
00:12:10.404 --> 00:12:11.739
No way. They make you do that?

198
00:12:11.771 --> 00:12:14.508
Yeah. some people
even had to go to Las Vegas.

199
00:12:14.542 --> 00:12:16.044
Good to know.

200
00:12:16.744 --> 00:12:19.147
Hmm. Shakespeare

201
00:12:19.179 --> 00:12:24.084
or a Marilyn Monroe
quote about twinkly stars?

202
00:12:24.117 --> 00:12:27.421
Uh. the only phrase
that can make a happy man sad

203
00:12:27.454 --> 00:12:29.156
and a sad man happy.

204
00:12:30.757 --> 00:12:32.692
You're so worldly. Rusty.

205
00:12:32.726 --> 00:12:34.294
Let's get out of here.

206
00:12:45.872 --> 00:12:47.074
Let me drive.

207
00:12:47.107 --> 00:12:48.208
What?

208
00:12:48.241 --> 00:12:50.111
I had half a beer. you had two.

209
00:12:50.144 --> 00:12:51.846
Trust me. I'm fine.

210
00:12:51.879 --> 00:12:53.214
See?

211
00:12:53.813 --> 00:12:55.082
Hmm?

212
00:12:55.216 --> 00:12:56.451
Watch.

213
00:13:01.489 --> 00:13:02.623
Sharp as a tack.

214
00:13:02.655 --> 00:13:03.623
Keys.

215
00:13:03.656 --> 00:13:04.858
Do you even have a license?

216
00:13:04.891 --> 00:13:06.393
Yes.

217
00:13:06.427 --> 00:13:07.796
In California?

218
00:13:08.395 --> 00:13:09.731
Give me the keys.

219
00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:12.833
Are you paying me
to drive or to argue?

220
00:13:15.202 --> 00:13:16.303
Get in.

221
00:13:42.263 --> 00:13:44.165
Look.

222
00:13:44.198 --> 00:13:47.534
after 55 years
or whatever you said.

223
00:13:48.401 --> 00:13:50.737
I think I would know
when I'm too drunk to drive.

224
00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:53.540
Two beers
plus a pound of bar mix

225
00:13:53.573 --> 00:13:56.144
does not equal inebriation.

226
00:13:56.177 --> 00:13:59.614
Indigestion. maybe.
but not inebriation.

227
00:13:59.646 --> 00:14:01.181
You're right.

228
00:14:01.649 --> 00:14:03.583
I'm sorry. I just...

229
00:14:03.616 --> 00:14:05.586
I forget that someone
who weighs like 250 pounds

230
00:14:05.619 --> 00:14:07.255
could probably drink
like a six pack

231
00:14:07.288 --> 00:14:08.389
without getting drunk.

232
00:14:08.422 --> 00:14:11.459
2... 200 and fifty... what?

233
00:14:11.491 --> 00:14:12.592
You wear it well.

234
00:14:12.626 --> 00:14:14.471
I mean. like. I'm sure
there's some muscle under there.

235
00:14:14.495 --> 00:14:15.730
Ooh. thanks.

236
00:14:16.362 --> 00:14:17.640
And don't get so defensive
about it.

237
00:14:17.664 --> 00:14:19.333
Thank... thank you so much.

238
00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:25.539
Seriously. though.
what do you weigh?

239
00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:26.674
Like 195?

240
00:14:26.707 --> 00:14:28.842
174. Thank you very much.

241
00:14:28.875 --> 00:14:29.910
Mm-hmm.

242
00:14:29.943 --> 00:14:32.246
Well. that's... that's actually
quite respectable.

243
00:14:32.279 --> 00:14:35.683
If I give you back 100 bucks.
will you cool it on the digs?

244
00:14:35.716 --> 00:14:37.685
Probably not.

245
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.255
Oh. will you make
a turn over there?

246
00:14:41.288 --> 00:14:42.557
Where are we going now?

247
00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:43.625
I don't know.

248
00:14:43.658 --> 00:14:46.394
Don't you just like driving
at night sometimes?

249
00:14:46.427 --> 00:14:47.795
No.

250
00:15:17.357 --> 00:15:18.926
Oh. look at those pretty lights.

251
00:15:35.708 --> 00:15:37.377
Fuck. he's still breathin'.

252
00:15:42.348 --> 00:15:45.485
Oh. Jesus Christ.
we gotta call 911.

253
00:15:45.519 --> 00:15:46.721
Hold on.

254
00:15:47.353 --> 00:15:48.922
Just take a deep breath.

255
00:15:48.956 --> 00:15:50.991
Let's just think this through.

256
00:15:51.025 --> 00:15:52.626
He's practically dead.

257
00:15:52.659 --> 00:15:53.861
He's gotta go to a hospital.

258
00:15:53.894 --> 00:15:54.695
Are you stupid?

259
00:15:54.727 --> 00:15:56.396
You take him
to a fucking hospital

260
00:15:56.429 --> 00:15:57.799
and they'll lock you up.

261
00:15:58.531 --> 00:16:00.500
How about we...
we just swing by a hospital

262
00:16:00.534 --> 00:16:01.534
and drop him off?

263
00:16:01.568 --> 00:16:03.837
You know.
the uh. emergency room?

264
00:16:03.871 --> 00:16:06.539
And say it... it... it was
like a... a hit-and-run

265
00:16:06.573 --> 00:16:07.875
that we witnessed.

266
00:16:07.908 --> 00:16:09.577
I mean I... I don't know.

267
00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:12.013
W... we...
we can't just leave him here.

268
00:16:12.045 --> 00:16:13.747
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

269
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:19.986
I'm sorry.
my boyfriend's shitfaced

270
00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.823
and he's acting like a dick.

271
00:16:22.755 --> 00:16:25.860
Frank. honey. get up.

272
00:16:25.893 --> 00:16:27.995
<i>I thought I heard a bang
out here or something.</i>

273
00:16:28.028 --> 00:16:29.830
Oh. jeez. I'm sorry.

274
00:16:29.862 --> 00:16:32.799
Uh. he jumped out of the car
while we were driving.

275
00:16:32.832 --> 00:16:34.401
He's not normally like this.

276
00:16:34.434 --> 00:16:35.702
He looks pretty bad.

277
00:16:35.736 --> 00:16:38.539
Yeah. he got fired from work
this afternoon

278
00:16:38.572 --> 00:16:41.542
and it's just been really shit.

279
00:16:41.574 --> 00:16:42.709
Honey.

280
00:16:42.742 --> 00:16:44.945
Frank. get up.

281
00:16:46.045 --> 00:16:48.715
Frank. you're making a scene.

282
00:16:49.783 --> 00:16:50.851
Get up.

283
00:16:51.617 --> 00:16:52.853
Help me.

284
00:16:53.953 --> 00:16:55.589
Let's put him in the backseat.

285
00:17:08.768 --> 00:17:10.037
<i>He all right?</i>

286
00:17:11.671 --> 00:17:13.873
Yeah. he's just really worried
with Christmas coming up.

287
00:17:13.907 --> 00:17:15.943
and it's gonna be really hard
for him to find a job

288
00:17:15.976 --> 00:17:17.044
until the new year.

289
00:17:17.076 --> 00:17:19.446
and... and his sister
just had another miscarriage.

290
00:17:19.479 --> 00:17:20.380
Oh. hey. no. no.

291
00:17:20.415 --> 00:17:22.550
I... I... I understand.
it... yeah. it's...

292
00:17:22.582 --> 00:17:24.017
It's rough out there.

293
00:17:24.051 --> 00:17:25.520
Merry Christmas!

294
00:17:42.936 --> 00:17:44.547
Fuck. I can only get
like one bar out here.

295
00:17:44.571 --> 00:17:46.073
Just look up a fucking hospital!

296
00:17:47.107 --> 00:17:49.143
There's one in Glendale.
It's only got 2.5 stars.

297
00:17:49.176 --> 00:17:51.011
It doesn't matter
how many stars it has!

298
00:17:51.044 --> 00:17:51.978
Where is it?

299
00:17:52.012 --> 00:17:53.648
- Central Avenue.
- Fine.

300
00:17:57.551 --> 00:17:58.720
Here.

301
00:17:59.852 --> 00:18:01.154
Put that away.

302
00:18:01.188 --> 00:18:02.756
I can't keep it.

303
00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:05.360
I still expect you
to finish the job.

304
00:18:08.528 --> 00:18:09.362
No.

305
00:18:09.397 --> 00:18:11.532
We drop him off
and then I drop you off.

306
00:18:11.564 --> 00:18:13.868
- I don't think so. Rusty.
- I don't care what you think.

307
00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:14.869
You should.

308
00:18:14.901 --> 00:18:16.937
I am the sole witness
to a pretty bad crime.

309
00:18:16.969 --> 00:18:18.037
It was an accident.

310
00:18:18.071 --> 00:18:20.016
Yeah. but moving him.
putting him into your car...

311
00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.609
All your idea.

312
00:18:21.641 --> 00:18:22.876
I was just tryin' to help you.

313
00:18:22.909 --> 00:18:24.711
Help me or help you?

314
00:18:24.745 --> 00:18:26.781
I just think it's best
we don't involve the cops.

315
00:18:26.813 --> 00:18:28.483
<i>We're still dropping him off.</i>

316
00:18:41.961 --> 00:18:43.797
Like you said.
it was an accident.

317
00:18:44.063 --> 00:18:45.900
I mean.
look at Inspector Gadget.

318
00:18:45.932 --> 00:18:49.502
He literally hit someone
and he is sweet.

319
00:18:49.535 --> 00:18:50.403
What?

320
00:18:50.437 --> 00:18:52.540
You know.
the Inspector Gadget guy?

321
00:18:52.573 --> 00:18:53.774
Matthew Broderick?

322
00:18:53.806 --> 00:18:54.974
Yeah.

323
00:18:55.007 --> 00:18:56.544
Oh. Christ.

324
00:19:01.881 --> 00:19:04.051
Oh. jeez.

325
00:19:04.985 --> 00:19:06.486
It's okay. man! You're okay!

326
00:19:06.919 --> 00:19:08.030
We're on our way to a hospital.

327
00:19:08.054 --> 00:19:08.988
Help him!

328
00:19:09.022 --> 00:19:10.124
With what?

329
00:19:13.726 --> 00:19:14.728
Dude.

330
00:19:16.563 --> 00:19:18.131
what the fuck just happened?

331
00:19:24.204 --> 00:19:26.174
Yeah. I think he...
he might be dead.

332
00:19:28.007 --> 00:19:29.509
He's dead.

333
00:19:31.945 --> 00:19:33.146
Oh. my God!

334
00:19:33.179 --> 00:19:35.650
Well. at least. you don't
have to go to the hospital now.

335
00:19:47.261 --> 00:19:48.963
Dude. wake up.

336
00:19:51.163 --> 00:19:52.632
Come on. man.

337
00:19:52.666 --> 00:19:54.001
Wake up.

338
00:19:54.234 --> 00:19:55.535
Wake up!

339
00:19:59.773 --> 00:20:01.876
Oh. Jesus Christ.

340
00:20:03.274 --> 00:20:04.077
This isn't happening.

341
00:20:04.111 --> 00:20:06.179
This is some crazy
fuckin' nightmare

342
00:20:06.213 --> 00:20:07.757
and all of a sudden
I'm gonna be in a Ferris wheel

343
00:20:07.781 --> 00:20:09.558
with my eighth grade
math teacher or something

344
00:20:09.582 --> 00:20:10.684
any minute now.

345
00:20:11.618 --> 00:20:13.154
Did you check his pocket
for goodies?

346
00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:14.988
Don't touch him!

347
00:20:15.188 --> 00:20:16.657
Ow!

348
00:20:17.724 --> 00:20:19.059
It's not like he cares.

349
00:20:47.019 --> 00:20:48.255
What?

350
00:20:49.989 --> 00:20:52.092
You're acting
like this is no big deal.

351
00:20:52.124 --> 00:20:55.228
which is really fucking
with my mind right now.

352
00:20:55.262 --> 00:20:58.666
Aren't you guilty
or worried or I... I...

353
00:20:58.698 --> 00:21:02.969
I don't know. freaked out.
nauseated. something?

354
00:21:03.003 --> 00:21:03.771
I don't know.

355
00:21:03.803 --> 00:21:05.573
Do you have some kinda record?

356
00:21:05.605 --> 00:21:07.640
Is that why you didn't want me
to call the cops?

357
00:21:07.673 --> 00:21:09.242
You're tryin' to cover
your own ass?

358
00:21:10.274 --> 00:21:10.744
I don't need this.

359
00:21:10.776 --> 00:21:12.645
- What?
- I wanna get out of the car.

360
00:21:12.678 --> 00:21:14.314
- Are you insane?
- I wanna get out.

361
00:21:14.415 --> 00:21:15.516
W... wait. wait.

362
00:21:15.548 --> 00:21:18.217
You're j... you're just
gonna stick me with this guy?

363
00:21:18.251 --> 00:21:20.688
I wanted to leave him there.
and call the cops.

364
00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.356
and you're just gonna stick me
with the fuckin' dead guy?

365
00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:25.626
Well. are we in this together
or not?

366
00:21:26.759 --> 00:21:28.270
Because I feel
like I've been pretty cool

367
00:21:28.294 --> 00:21:29.796
throughout this whole situation.

368
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:30.997
Seriously?

369
00:21:31.031 --> 00:21:33.133
I don't need this. Pull over.

370
00:21:54.987 --> 00:21:57.791
All right.
we're in this together.

371
00:21:57.823 --> 00:21:59.892
We're in this together.

372
00:21:59.926 --> 00:22:01.195
Just get back in the car.

373
00:22:02.396 --> 00:22:03.598
No.

374
00:22:04.798 --> 00:22:07.067
- Where are you gonna go?
- I'll just get another ride.

375
00:22:08.067 --> 00:22:09.903
Get in the car. please.

376
00:22:11.371 --> 00:22:12.672
Please.

377
00:22:12.706 --> 00:22:13.540
No.

378
00:22:13.573 --> 00:22:15.375
Look.
I'll give you your money back.

379
00:22:19.146 --> 00:22:20.348
I need you.

380
00:22:21.814 --> 00:22:23.784
You're resourceful and kinda...

381
00:22:25.017 --> 00:22:26.386
- Deviant.
- Thank you.

382
00:22:26.419 --> 00:22:28.855
Plus that guy is really hard
to carry by myself.

383
00:22:29.855 --> 00:22:31.891
Put the money away. Rusty.
it's tacky.

384
00:22:34.061 --> 00:22:35.696
- Can I drive?
- No.

385
00:22:48.941 --> 00:22:50.019
You sure they're still open?

386
00:22:50.043 --> 00:22:51.712
Yelp says they close at 10:00.

387
00:22:54.246 --> 00:22:56.883
All right. we got 12 minutes.

388
00:22:56.917 --> 00:22:58.718
Well. you parked
so bloody far away.

389
00:22:58.752 --> 00:23:00.087
Why'd you have to do that?

390
00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.160
It's gonna take us fuckin'
10 minutes to walk there.

391
00:23:04.157 --> 00:23:06.025
You sure he's okay here?

392
00:23:06.059 --> 00:23:07.995
What's he gonna do?

393
00:23:08.928 --> 00:23:10.096
He's dead.

394
00:23:14.034 --> 00:23:15.703
Do we cover him up?

395
00:23:16.136 --> 00:23:17.738
It's dark.

396
00:23:17.771 --> 00:23:19.306
What if somebody comes by?

397
00:23:19.339 --> 00:23:21.275
- Like who?
- I don't know.

398
00:23:21.307 --> 00:23:26.713
I don't know like. vagrants
or maybe cops on patrol?

399
00:23:28.247 --> 00:23:31.418
- Well. do you wanna stay here while I go in?
- No.

400
00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:33.120
Okay. Um...

401
00:23:34.821 --> 00:23:37.257
- Should I stay here. keep watch and you go in?
- No.

402
00:23:42.161 --> 00:23:43.396
Good evening.

403
00:23:44.563 --> 00:23:47.767
Just stick with the plan
and quit acting suspicious.

404
00:23:47.801 --> 00:23:49.177
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize "good evening"

405
00:23:49.201 --> 00:23:50.503
was an admission of guilt.

406
00:23:50.536 --> 00:23:51.871
Just get your shit

407
00:23:51.905 --> 00:23:53.708
and meet me back
at the register.

408
00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:54.901
Good evening.

409
00:24:54.935 --> 00:24:56.270
Hey.

410
00:24:57.838 --> 00:24:59.239
Ah. those look nice.

411
00:24:59.272 --> 00:25:00.516
Your mom's really
gonna like that purple one.

412
00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.343
it goes with her um...

413
00:25:03.976 --> 00:25:04.745
What do you call them?

414
00:25:04.777 --> 00:25:06.146
Things they hang up on the wall?

415
00:25:08.215 --> 00:25:09.448
A dreamcatcher?

416
00:25:09.482 --> 00:25:10.884
No.

417
00:25:10.917 --> 00:25:13.153
No. it's uh.
it's what makes the noise.

418
00:25:13.186 --> 00:25:15.823
Uh. you know what I mean?

419
00:25:16.523 --> 00:25:19.359
You know. it uh. yeah.
the wind...

420
00:25:19.391 --> 00:25:22.595
wind goes through it
and then... chimes!

421
00:25:24.096 --> 00:25:26.098
Wind chimes.

422
00:25:26.131 --> 00:25:27.601
It'll match her purple
wind chimes.

423
00:25:27.633 --> 00:25:29.602
She loves her wind chimes.

424
00:25:29.636 --> 00:25:31.138
She loves them.

425
00:25:31.537 --> 00:25:33.005
Doing some pruning.

426
00:25:33.038 --> 00:25:34.250
You know. mom thinks
it's very important

427
00:25:34.274 --> 00:25:36.843
we cut the tips of the plants.
so they don't get overgrown.

428
00:25:37.977 --> 00:25:39.345
She knows.

429
00:25:39.379 --> 00:25:41.448
Actually. I work in plumbing.

430
00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.949
Cool.

431
00:25:43.917 --> 00:25:44.885
- Darling?
- Hmm?

432
00:25:44.918 --> 00:25:46.558
Are we not supposed
to get a saw or an axe

433
00:25:46.585 --> 00:25:47.621
or something like that?

434
00:25:47.653 --> 00:25:49.388
I changed my mind.

435
00:25:49.421 --> 00:25:50.923
Mom's gonna be pissed.

436
00:25:50.957 --> 00:25:53.393
Well. she'll just
have to get over it.

437
00:26:00.432 --> 00:26:03.236
Those are actually buy one.
get one 50% off.

438
00:26:03.269 --> 00:26:05.104
Oh. then we don't have to share.

439
00:26:06.907 --> 00:26:07.941
You want a bag?

440
00:26:07.974 --> 00:26:08.976
I'll hold these.

441
00:26:09.008 --> 00:26:10.844
It's $84.31.

442
00:26:20.053 --> 00:26:22.956
- You folks need any help out to your car?
- No.

443
00:26:22.988 --> 00:26:24.290
No. thank you.

444
00:26:52.151 --> 00:26:53.586
Come on. hurry up.

445
00:27:32.292 --> 00:27:34.227
Why do I feel like
you've done this before?

446
00:27:40.332 --> 00:27:41.567
This is so fucked.

447
00:27:41.601 --> 00:27:43.011
What are even gonna do
when we get there?

448
00:27:43.035 --> 00:27:44.036
Get our shit.

449
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:45.472
Oh. yes. of course.

450
00:27:45.505 --> 00:27:47.239
Uh. "Excuse me. sir or ma'am.

451
00:27:47.273 --> 00:27:49.307
uh. we'd like to get
our shit back.

452
00:27:49.309 --> 00:27:51.011
Don't worry.
you can keep the body."

453
00:27:51.044 --> 00:27:52.087
I wasn't planning on asking.

454
00:27:52.111 --> 00:27:53.289
What. you're just gonna
hit him over the head

455
00:27:53.313 --> 00:27:53.980
with your hammer?

456
00:27:54.014 --> 00:27:55.314
Don't you want your car back?

457
00:27:55.348 --> 00:27:56.350
Probably not.

458
00:27:56.382 --> 00:27:57.683
It's probably better this way.

459
00:27:57.717 --> 00:28:00.120
I report the car stolen.
some asshole has it.

460
00:28:00.152 --> 00:28:03.222
they killed the dude.
no harm. no foul.

461
00:28:03.255 --> 00:28:05.033
"I don't know. officer.
we just got carjacked."

462
00:28:05.057 --> 00:28:06.258
- No.
- This is perfect.

463
00:28:06.292 --> 00:28:08.095
This is our perfect out.

464
00:28:13.733 --> 00:28:14.601
What are you doing?

465
00:28:14.633 --> 00:28:16.469
Getting our shit back.

466
00:28:16.503 --> 00:28:17.704
Oh. God!

467
00:28:17.736 --> 00:28:21.041
Look. I'll buy you new jewelry

468
00:28:21.073 --> 00:28:23.509
or whatever it is
you've got in there. just...

469
00:28:23.543 --> 00:28:24.644
This isn't worth it.

470
00:28:26.079 --> 00:28:27.481
Real nice. arsehole!

471
00:28:27.514 --> 00:28:29.750
Okay. okay.
let's just stick with the one

472
00:28:29.783 --> 00:28:31.986
vehicular manslaughter
for today.

473
00:29:25.638 --> 00:29:27.207
Where's the fucking body?

474
00:29:28.474 --> 00:29:30.819
I don't know. This whole thing
has been really fuckin' crazy.

475
00:29:30.843 --> 00:29:32.645
Look. I know. I know.
I know. okay?

476
00:29:33.813 --> 00:29:35.582
But I need to get
that suitcase back.

477
00:29:36.615 --> 00:29:38.784
We're still talking about
the goddamn suitcase.

478
00:29:38.817 --> 00:29:41.153
I told you. it's not worth it!

479
00:29:41.187 --> 00:29:42.856
The body is gone.

480
00:29:42.889 --> 00:29:44.658
The suitcase is a really
distant second

481
00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:45.858
to the missing body!

482
00:29:45.891 --> 00:29:47.861
- Okay. you wait here.
- What?

483
00:29:47.893 --> 00:29:49.105
You wait here. I'll run inside.

484
00:29:49.129 --> 00:29:52.532
If I'm not back in five minutes.
just take the car and scram.

485
00:29:52.564 --> 00:29:53.265
Oh. you're just gonna
knock on the door

486
00:29:53.298 --> 00:29:54.633
and beat the guy
with the hammer?

487
00:29:54.667 --> 00:29:56.669
No. I'm gonna break in.

488
00:29:56.703 --> 00:29:58.539
then I'm gonna beat the guy
with the hammer.

489
00:30:02.242 --> 00:30:03.444
Okay.

490
00:30:04.476 --> 00:30:06.846
Jesus Christ.
I hope you're still there.

491
00:30:13.285 --> 00:30:14.554
What?

492
00:30:15.889 --> 00:30:17.189
I got mugged two months ago.

493
00:30:17.223 --> 00:30:18.892
You've had that the whole time.

494
00:30:20.159 --> 00:30:22.129
I'm sorry. you're right.

495
00:30:22.161 --> 00:30:24.630
I guess it would have been handy
when that guy flipped you off

496
00:30:24.663 --> 00:30:26.509
or maybe we could have
just held up the hardware store

497
00:30:26.533 --> 00:30:28.309
instead of paying for those
goddamn plants and shit.

498
00:30:28.333 --> 00:30:29.870
Do you even know
how to use that?

499
00:30:29.902 --> 00:30:31.438
If you want. I can wait here

500
00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:33.190
and you can just go inside
with that hammer.

501
00:30:34.506 --> 00:30:35.708
I fucking hate you.

502
00:31:27.226 --> 00:31:28.227
Where is it?

503
00:31:29.161 --> 00:31:31.731
I will give you 10 seconds
to get out.

504
00:31:34.633 --> 00:31:35.935
- Russell!
- Let her go.

505
00:31:40.473 --> 00:31:42.976
You are in way over your head.
man.

506
00:31:43.008 --> 00:31:44.477
Shut up.

507
00:31:45.945 --> 00:31:47.514
The suitcase?

508
00:32:03.428 --> 00:32:04.765
All right?

509
00:32:05.864 --> 00:32:07.433
Grab it and let's go.

510
00:32:11.938 --> 00:32:13.640
What do you wanna do with him?

511
00:32:13.672 --> 00:32:15.409
Nothing. Let's go.

512
00:32:15.842 --> 00:32:18.445
2SBI653?

513
00:32:19.411 --> 00:32:20.313
Excuse me?

514
00:32:20.346 --> 00:32:22.982
It's your license plate
number. right?

515
00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:24.951
Yeah.

516
00:32:25.618 --> 00:32:26.452
Let's go.

517
00:32:26.486 --> 00:32:28.655
Look. you want money
or something?

518
00:32:28.688 --> 00:32:30.323
A fuckin' ride to the ER?
I don't know.

519
00:32:30.355 --> 00:32:31.366
Can't we work
something out here?

520
00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:32.159
Have you lost your mind?

521
00:32:32.191 --> 00:32:33.726
He knows
my license plate number.

522
00:32:33.759 --> 00:32:35.261
He's gonna call
the fucking cops!

523
00:32:35.294 --> 00:32:36.996
- Bingo.
- Bull shit.

524
00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:38.999
The fuck are you listening
to this bitch for?

525
00:32:39.798 --> 00:32:41.267
Leave the case.

526
00:32:41.301 --> 00:32:42.836
It's like none of this
ever happened.

527
00:32:44.403 --> 00:32:45.571
Fuck no.

528
00:32:46.839 --> 00:32:48.708
- Leave it.
- Nope.

529
00:32:50.575 --> 00:32:52.911
I'm not goin' to jail
over your goddamn suitcase.

530
00:32:52.945 --> 00:32:54.014
leave it!

531
00:32:54.046 --> 00:32:55.515
Nope.

532
00:32:55.814 --> 00:32:58.451
Charlotte. we're going.

533
00:33:03.855 --> 00:33:05.067
You really think
I'm gonna let you

534
00:33:05.091 --> 00:33:06.892
fuck this up for me again?

535
00:33:20.939 --> 00:33:22.441
Shit.

536
00:33:22.874 --> 00:33:24.577
Now. we really gotta bury him.

537
00:33:26.579 --> 00:33:27.547
What do you think.
like some sheets

538
00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:29.383
or something to wrap him up in?

539
00:33:29.649 --> 00:33:33.320
Or maybe a shower curtain liner.
you know. less dripping.

540
00:33:33.352 --> 00:33:34.853
I'm sorry. what?

541
00:33:34.887 --> 00:33:37.890
Russell.
we need to get him out of here.

542
00:33:38.725 --> 00:33:39.892
What difference does it make?

543
00:33:39.926 --> 00:33:41.660
Uh. you...
you hit him with the car.

544
00:33:41.694 --> 00:33:43.930
I shot him. he was dead.
then he wasn't. now he is.

545
00:33:45.564 --> 00:33:46.533
Oh.

546
00:33:46.565 --> 00:33:47.633
Oh. God.

547
00:33:47.667 --> 00:33:50.736
I don't... I don't think
I have the stomach for this.

548
00:33:51.603 --> 00:33:53.707
It was an accident?

549
00:33:53.739 --> 00:33:55.474
Accidents happen.

550
00:33:57.642 --> 00:33:59.078
But this...

551
00:34:00.112 --> 00:34:02.615
Wha...

552
00:34:04.449 --> 00:34:06.719
What the fuck is wrong with you?

553
00:34:09.055 --> 00:34:09.889
You wait here.

554
00:34:09.923 --> 00:34:12.325
I'll go find something
to wrap him in.

555
00:34:13.059 --> 00:34:16.028
Maybe you can find a ginger ale
in the fridge or something

556
00:34:16.061 --> 00:34:18.030
to settle that weak-ass
stomach of yours.

557
00:34:18.064 --> 00:34:19.599
But in 10 minutes.
I'm gonna be back

558
00:34:19.631 --> 00:34:21.501
and you're gonna help me carry him out.

559
00:34:21.534 --> 00:34:22.869
Understood?

560
00:34:27.572 --> 00:34:28.708
Okay.

561
00:34:29.409 --> 00:34:30.843
Great.

562
00:35:20.559 --> 00:35:21.762
Look what I found.

563
00:35:22.561 --> 00:35:23.896
It's raining cats and dogs.

564
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:28.000
Weird choice.
but I kinda like it.

565
00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.668
No?

566
00:35:31.671 --> 00:35:32.873
Let's wrap him up.

567
00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:45.485
You got any troubles?

568
00:35:45.818 --> 00:35:46.820
Yeah.

569
00:35:47.019 --> 00:35:48.455
Good. let's go.

570
00:36:12.711 --> 00:36:14.180
- What?
- Nothing. hold on.

571
00:36:23.756 --> 00:36:25.759
- What's so funny?
- Sorry. what?

572
00:36:26.224 --> 00:36:31.664
You... never mind.

573
00:36:33.633 --> 00:36:35.569
Don't you think this song
is kinda dark?

574
00:36:36.702 --> 00:36:38.872
Like. isn't it a bad thing
if babies don't cry?

575
00:36:38.905 --> 00:36:41.740
Couldn't they turn out to be
down syndrome or something?

576
00:36:41.773 --> 00:36:45.143
I think it's just implying
that He was a really good baby.

577
00:36:45.177 --> 00:36:46.278
Hmm.

578
00:36:49.749 --> 00:36:51.517
Top five
favorite Christmas songs.

579
00:36:52.352 --> 00:36:55.221
Um. uh. I would say. number one.

580
00:36:55.253 --> 00:36:58.223
"All I Want for Christmas Is
You". Mariah Carey. obviously.

581
00:36:58.256 --> 00:37:01.193
- Two. "Frosty the Snowman" by Michael Bublé.
- What?

582
00:37:01.227 --> 00:37:04.030
Um. three.

583
00:37:04.063 --> 00:37:05.898
"Christmas in Harlem"
by Kanye West.

584
00:37:05.932 --> 00:37:06.866
That's a good one.

585
00:37:06.898 --> 00:37:09.201
Um. hmm.

586
00:37:09.235 --> 00:37:10.736
What's that rockin' song
in Home Alone

587
00:37:10.769 --> 00:37:12.704
where Kevin's tryin'
to scare away the robbers.

588
00:37:12.738 --> 00:37:14.640
and he puts the mannequin
on the turntable.

589
00:37:14.673 --> 00:37:16.175
and then he has
that cardboard cut-out

590
00:37:16.207 --> 00:37:18.677
of um. uh. Michael Jackson.

591
00:37:18.711 --> 00:37:19.812
It's Michael Jordan.

592
00:37:19.845 --> 00:37:22.615
Yeah.
those are probably my favorite

593
00:37:22.648 --> 00:37:23.725
and I can't think
of another one.

594
00:37:23.749 --> 00:37:25.118
so I probably only have
a top four.

595
00:37:25.151 --> 00:37:26.252
What are yours?

596
00:37:26.285 --> 00:37:27.820
Yeah. yeah. those are good.

597
00:37:27.852 --> 00:37:29.021
You don't like them?

598
00:37:30.322 --> 00:37:31.857
Uh. the Mariah Carey one
is nice.

599
00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:34.026
Oh come on. get into it!

600
00:37:34.293 --> 00:37:36.296
Okay. I... I was...
I was always partial

601
00:37:36.329 --> 00:37:40.099
to "The Little Drummer Boy" duet
between Bowie and Bing Crosby.

602
00:37:40.131 --> 00:37:42.200
Fuck. how can you listen
to Bing Crosby?

603
00:37:42.233 --> 00:37:45.003
You know.
he raped like 50 million women.

604
00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:51.577
No. not Bill Cosby. Bing Crosby.

605
00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:52.711
What's the matter with you?

606
00:37:52.744 --> 00:37:54.212
There's a lot to keep track of.

607
00:37:54.246 --> 00:37:55.581
I guess.

608
00:37:56.014 --> 00:37:57.082
You don't know.

609
00:37:57.115 --> 00:37:58.359
Well. how far
are you making me drive?

610
00:37:58.383 --> 00:38:01.019
Why? Are you still planning
on tryin' to make that party?

611
00:38:01.052 --> 00:38:03.322
Well. we might need
to stop for gas soon.

612
00:38:05.758 --> 00:38:08.761
Well. I really enjoyed
your sob story earlier.

613
00:38:08.793 --> 00:38:10.929
You know.
about your life turning to shit.

614
00:38:10.963 --> 00:38:13.967
and your girlfriend leaving you.
all that stuff.

615
00:38:15.066 --> 00:38:17.302
But somehow
you had a really cool friend

616
00:38:17.336 --> 00:38:19.372
throwing a Christmas party
that you ditched

617
00:38:19.405 --> 00:38:20.872
to hang out with me.

618
00:38:20.905 --> 00:38:23.075
That guy wouldn't bail me out.

619
00:38:25.744 --> 00:38:28.880
And what about you
and this hilarious texter?

620
00:38:28.914 --> 00:38:29.990
You're sitting there.
yuckin' it up.

621
00:38:30.014 --> 00:38:31.959
but before you're acting
like your whole family died

622
00:38:31.983 --> 00:38:33.227
in a house fire
and you're the only one

623
00:38:33.251 --> 00:38:34.930
- that made it out alive.
- Shut the fuck up!

624
00:38:34.954 --> 00:38:37.222
What mumsy and dadsy
cut off your Amex Black

625
00:38:37.256 --> 00:38:40.093
and you're practically or...
Ow. Jesus!

626
00:38:40.358 --> 00:38:42.961
You don't talk about my family.

627
00:38:42.994 --> 00:38:44.130
Alright.

628
00:38:44.162 --> 00:38:46.064
Christ. I'm sorry.

629
00:38:48.934 --> 00:38:50.870
- Do you wanna talk about...
- No.

630
00:38:50.903 --> 00:38:51.903
Okay.

631
00:39:04.883 --> 00:39:06.918
Well. what I said
before was true.

632
00:39:06.952 --> 00:39:08.154
I don't have...

633
00:39:08.186 --> 00:39:10.288
Look. Rusty.
I'm sure you've made some

634
00:39:10.322 --> 00:39:13.660
very shitty decisions
in your life and yeah.

635
00:39:13.693 --> 00:39:15.093
- your girlfriend left you.
- Wife.

636
00:39:15.126 --> 00:39:16.195
Whatever. okay?

637
00:39:16.227 --> 00:39:18.697
I don't care
and I'm not interested.

638
00:39:18.731 --> 00:39:20.491
- I was just tryin' to make...
- Well. don't.

639
00:39:21.834 --> 00:39:24.337
Because our shit is different.

640
00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:27.039
You got that right.

641
00:39:31.744 --> 00:39:33.146
12 miles that way.

642
00:39:34.479 --> 00:39:36.682
Oh. bury a lot of bodies
out in Winchester?

643
00:39:36.715 --> 00:39:38.016
Nah. just this one.

644
00:40:21.459 --> 00:40:22.996
Grab the feet.

645
00:40:36.008 --> 00:40:37.444
There's no one around here.

646
00:40:38.209 --> 00:40:39.845
Hello?

647
00:40:41.113 --> 00:40:42.482
See?

648
00:40:45.785 --> 00:40:47.253
Go get the shovels.

649
00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:15.881
What now?

650
00:41:20.285 --> 00:41:21.897
We've gotta get rid
of his fingers and teeth.

651
00:41:21.921 --> 00:41:23.189
Yeah.

652
00:41:23.389 --> 00:41:25.358
No. I'll dig the hole.

653
00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:27.793
You do whatever it is
you're gonna do with those.

654
00:41:27.827 --> 00:41:28.494
You sure?

655
00:41:28.526 --> 00:41:30.429
Absolute-fucking-lutely.

656
00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:32.999
Suit yourself.

657
00:41:33.032 --> 00:41:35.066
You know. if they find him.

658
00:41:35.099 --> 00:41:37.435
they can probably identify him
using his DNA.

659
00:41:37.468 --> 00:41:39.438
Yeah.
but why make it easy for them?

660
00:41:52.952 --> 00:41:55.421
Poor. stupid.
presumptuous Frank.

661
00:41:57.523 --> 00:41:59.191
Frank?

662
00:41:59.224 --> 00:42:02.327
Yeah. my drunk boyfriend.
remember we told that guy.

663
00:42:04.563 --> 00:42:06.398
Remember?

664
00:42:06.432 --> 00:42:07.967
Sure.

665
00:42:08.967 --> 00:42:11.204
So I guess
I just take the hammer.

666
00:42:25.351 --> 00:42:28.019
Oh. they're all
going inside his mouth. gross.

667
00:42:28.052 --> 00:42:29.052
You done?

668
00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:32.892
Yeah.

669
00:42:48.941 --> 00:42:51.311
I'm gonna just have to
pick them out of his mouth.

670
00:42:56.014 --> 00:42:57.449
Gross.

671
00:42:58.983 --> 00:43:01.353
I'm glad this is so hilarious.

672
00:43:01.387 --> 00:43:03.423
Well. if I don't laugh.
I'll cry.

673
00:43:03.956 --> 00:43:04.923
You don't cry.

674
00:43:04.956 --> 00:43:08.526
Okay. well. if I don't laugh.
I'll throw up.

675
00:43:08.559 --> 00:43:10.061
Fair enough.

676
00:43:13.432 --> 00:43:15.602
Did your parents ever do
that This Little Piggy thing?

677
00:43:16.068 --> 00:43:16.968
Sure.

678
00:43:17.003 --> 00:43:18.905
This little piggy
went to the market.

679
00:43:18.938 --> 00:43:21.240
this little piggy went...

680
00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:24.343
- Home.
- Yeah. I got it.

681
00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:28.613
This little piggy
went wee. wee. wee

682
00:43:28.646 --> 00:43:30.148
all the way home.

683
00:43:30.182 --> 00:43:31.015
You all done?

684
00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:33.151
Mm.
I got five little piggies left.

685
00:43:33.184 --> 00:43:35.188
Think you can do
without the commentary?

686
00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:38.690
Rusty doesn't want
the commentary. Frank.

687
00:43:38.724 --> 00:43:40.359
Stop callin' him "Frank".

688
00:43:40.392 --> 00:43:42.962
Frankly.
I don't give a franking Frank.

689
00:43:43.695 --> 00:43:44.930
Just...

690
00:43:44.963 --> 00:43:46.698
stop humanizing him.

691
00:43:46.731 --> 00:43:50.035
I'm sure this is like a typical
Saturday night for you.

692
00:43:50.068 --> 00:43:51.446
but I'm just trying
to get through this

693
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:53.572
without projectile vomiting.
okay?

694
00:43:53.604 --> 00:43:54.639
Just...

695
00:43:54.673 --> 00:43:58.444
finish the thing with the hand
and cover him up.

696
00:43:58.477 --> 00:44:00.179
Jesus Christ!

697
00:44:01.079 --> 00:44:03.048
This little piggy
went to the market.

698
00:44:03.081 --> 00:44:04.983
this little piggy went home.

699
00:44:05.017 --> 00:44:06.152
This little piggy went

700
00:44:06.184 --> 00:44:08.654
all the way wee. wee.
wee. wee home.

701
00:44:10.555 --> 00:44:11.557
Done.

702
00:44:30.476 --> 00:44:32.178
Maybe we shouldn't wrap him up
in plastic.

703
00:44:32.211 --> 00:44:33.678
it might fuck up the decaying.

704
00:44:36.148 --> 00:44:37.182
You're probably right.

705
00:44:37.215 --> 00:44:38.049
You know. every bit of plastic

706
00:44:38.084 --> 00:44:40.152
that's ever been made
is still around.

707
00:44:40.184 --> 00:44:42.020
- Bullshit.
- It's true.

708
00:44:42.787 --> 00:44:44.189
What about if you burn it?

709
00:44:44.222 --> 00:44:45.457
Are you done or what?

710
00:44:46.624 --> 00:44:48.744
- It'll go faster if you help.
- I already did my bit.

711
00:44:50.396 --> 00:44:51.564
Fine.

712
00:45:47.285 --> 00:45:48.686
Help me out. Rusty?

713
00:45:53.592 --> 00:45:55.327
You look like
you've done this before.

714
00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:56.595
Really?

715
00:45:56.628 --> 00:45:59.398
I did a little landscaping
in college.

716
00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:01.467
There used to be
this office park.

717
00:46:02.568 --> 00:46:05.338
- I had to sit on the lawn mower.
- Let's get him in.

718
00:46:52.450 --> 00:46:53.653
Let's cover him up.

719
00:47:14.472 --> 00:47:15.883
Hey. what do you wanna do
about those?

720
00:47:15.907 --> 00:47:17.307
Burn 'em.

721
00:47:17.309 --> 00:47:18.276
What?

722
00:47:18.309 --> 00:47:20.445
I thought you said
you can't destroy plastic.

723
00:47:20.479 --> 00:47:22.181
That doesn't sound right.

724
00:47:22.747 --> 00:47:24.582
Do you have a lighter?

725
00:47:24.615 --> 00:47:25.818
No.

726
00:47:31.722 --> 00:47:34.492
Hey.
you can't just burn that here.

727
00:47:34.526 --> 00:47:35.527
Why?

728
00:47:35.561 --> 00:47:38.463
Because there's...
there's brush everywhere.

729
00:47:38.497 --> 00:47:40.332
We should have got like acid
or something.

730
00:47:40.365 --> 00:47:42.468
- Acid?
- Yeah. you know...

731
00:47:45.903 --> 00:47:47.472
Follow me.

732
00:47:53.211 --> 00:47:55.514
I would fucking kill
for a cigarette right now.

733
00:47:56.948 --> 00:47:58.885
Or a vape.

734
00:47:59.383 --> 00:48:00.852
A vape would be good.

735
00:48:00.885 --> 00:48:03.421
You know. they have
French-toast-flavored vape.

736
00:48:05.791 --> 00:48:07.493
Now. I feel like French toast.

737
00:48:09.394 --> 00:48:12.798
French toast with bacon.
and strawberries.

738
00:48:12.831 --> 00:48:14.666
and caramelized banana.

739
00:48:15.434 --> 00:48:17.468
And like a side of fruit.

740
00:48:17.501 --> 00:48:18.541
but not cheap. good fruit.

741
00:48:18.570 --> 00:48:20.872
like with mango.
and blueberries.

742
00:48:20.905 --> 00:48:23.342
and kiwi fruit.
and passion fruit.

743
00:48:23.374 --> 00:48:25.811
and a latte.

744
00:48:25.843 --> 00:48:27.813
In tho... one of those big bowls

745
00:48:27.845 --> 00:48:29.648
they serve in like.
French places.

746
00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:30.825
you know what I'm talkin' about?

747
00:48:30.849 --> 00:48:32.318
Or room service.

748
00:48:32.351 --> 00:48:34.253
I'd love room service right now.

749
00:48:35.553 --> 00:48:39.224
I love the little mini jams
and stuff they give you.

750
00:48:39.258 --> 00:48:40.259
They're so cute.

751
00:48:40.291 --> 00:48:42.227
And the butter's all cold.

752
00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:43.963
Except sometimes the eggs
get sweaty.

753
00:48:43.996 --> 00:48:45.698
'cause they put that
cover on it.

754
00:48:46.965 --> 00:48:49.267
- That... What's that cover called?
- Hmm?

755
00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:50.678
You know. that silver cover
they give you.

756
00:48:50.702 --> 00:48:52.338
like. to cover your food.

757
00:48:52.371 --> 00:48:53.539
Cloche.

758
00:48:53.639 --> 00:48:54.807
Cloche.

759
00:48:55.606 --> 00:48:58.276
Yeah. sweaty eggs are no good.

760
00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:59.744
They need to sort that out.

761
00:49:10.289 --> 00:49:12.225
Just a little bit longer.

762
00:49:15.394 --> 00:49:17.529
- This would be a really good day.
- What?

763
00:49:17.561 --> 00:49:19.598
Not the bloody part. dipshit.

764
00:49:21.332 --> 00:49:23.936
but like driving out of LA.

765
00:49:23.968 --> 00:49:26.938
going for a night walk.
the fire.

766
00:49:26.972 --> 00:49:28.383
I mean. we're basically
in a fucking.

767
00:49:28.407 --> 00:49:29.484
Hershey's commercial right now.

768
00:49:29.508 --> 00:49:32.711
All we need is a guy jamming
on an acoustic guitar.

769
00:49:32.744 --> 00:49:35.046
and a dog wearing a really cool.
like bandana.

770
00:49:35.079 --> 00:49:37.015
and uh. maybe like airstream.

771
00:49:37.048 --> 00:49:38.883
like. one of those vintage ones.
you know.

772
00:49:38.916 --> 00:49:41.986
with the... those lights.
the stringy lights.

773
00:49:42.019 --> 00:49:43.488
the Edisony ones.

774
00:49:43.521 --> 00:49:45.423
Do you know if there's a lake
nearby here.

775
00:49:45.456 --> 00:49:46.825
'cause that'll be perfect.

776
00:49:50.628 --> 00:49:51.930
What are you doing?

777
00:49:52.097 --> 00:49:53.733
Tryin' to make sure
we destroyed it all.

778
00:49:58.602 --> 00:50:00.539
Let's go.

779
00:50:00.572 --> 00:50:01.941
But we just got here.

780
00:50:03.941 --> 00:50:05.777
Wait a sec!

781
00:50:05.811 --> 00:50:08.089
We've had a crazy fucking night.
we should be good by now.

782
00:50:08.113 --> 00:50:09.656
It's like that...
it's like that football team

783
00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:11.091
that landed in the mountains.
they ate their coach

784
00:50:11.115 --> 00:50:11.784
or something.

785
00:50:11.816 --> 00:50:14.352
Like. that shit makes you tight.

786
00:50:14.385 --> 00:50:18.056
Sweet motherfucking Jesus.
please stop talking.

787
00:50:40.912 --> 00:50:42.615
What's your move. Rusty?

788
00:50:42.981 --> 00:50:44.050
What the fuck is this?

789
00:50:45.751 --> 00:50:46.985
A fake Goyard.

790
00:50:47.017 --> 00:50:48.521
Open it.

791
00:50:53.557 --> 00:50:55.660
What's the name
on the driver's license?

792
00:50:59.731 --> 00:51:01.700
- Francis.
- Frank.

793
00:51:02.534 --> 00:51:03.736
Benjamin Newton.

794
00:51:05.102 --> 00:51:06.604
You knew this guy?

795
00:51:07.606 --> 00:51:10.109
- No.
- Did you plan this whole fucking thing?

796
00:51:10.142 --> 00:51:11.744
Please.

797
00:51:11.776 --> 00:51:13.611
How'd you know his name?

798
00:51:14.012 --> 00:51:15.414
Just looks like a Frank.

799
00:51:15.447 --> 00:51:17.816
Stop bullshitting!

800
00:51:20.084 --> 00:51:21.853
I've seen him around.

801
00:51:23.454 --> 00:51:24.856
We weren't friends.

802
00:51:24.889 --> 00:51:26.100
I mean.
he's barely an acquaintance.

803
00:51:26.124 --> 00:51:29.495
I'm just good at learning names.

804
00:51:29.528 --> 00:51:30.872
The girl who served us
at the store tonight.

805
00:51:30.896 --> 00:51:32.164
her name was um. Iris.

806
00:51:32.197 --> 00:51:33.666
Shut it!

807
00:51:34.499 --> 00:51:35.968
What's in the suitcase?

808
00:51:36.901 --> 00:51:39.137
- My stuff.
- Mm-hmm.

809
00:51:39.171 --> 00:51:42.707
What is in the suitcase?

810
00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:45.043
It's my personal shit. okay?

811
00:51:45.443 --> 00:51:46.746
Get out of the car.

812
00:51:47.111 --> 00:51:48.046
Ha-ha.

813
00:51:48.079 --> 00:51:51.150
Either you tell me
what's in the suitcase

814
00:51:51.182 --> 00:51:54.619
or you can get out
and I'll open it myself.

815
00:51:54.653 --> 00:51:55.721
You wouldn't understand.

816
00:51:55.753 --> 00:51:57.088
Try me.

817
00:52:00.559 --> 00:52:01.727
Okay.

818
00:52:02.626 --> 00:52:04.028
Be my guest.

819
00:52:40.499 --> 00:52:41.667
Satisfied?

820
00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:43.001
What's it for?

821
00:52:43.034 --> 00:52:45.503
I told you
you wouldn't understand.

822
00:52:50.041 --> 00:52:51.677
What the fuck are you doing?

823
00:52:58.215 --> 00:52:59.884
What the fuck?

824
00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:03.055
Okay!

825
00:53:05.023 --> 00:53:06.624
Okay. okay!

826
00:53:06.858 --> 00:53:07.858
You win!

827
00:53:08.793 --> 00:53:10.095
I'll show you!

828
00:53:40.224 --> 00:53:41.259
It's a key.

829
00:53:41.293 --> 00:53:42.827
I got that.

830
00:53:44.095 --> 00:53:45.964
For a room.

831
00:53:45.997 --> 00:53:47.500
Uh-huh.

832
00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:51.736
It's a very. very strange room.

833
00:53:56.874 --> 00:53:59.911
I have never hit a woman
in my entire life.

834
00:54:01.947 --> 00:54:03.981
Not Jenny Mansky in third grade

835
00:54:04.014 --> 00:54:05.884
when she pants me on field day.

836
00:54:06.584 --> 00:54:09.153
Not Richa Choudhary.
she kicked me in the nuts

837
00:54:09.186 --> 00:54:13.191
every fucking time we were
sparring partners in boxing.

838
00:54:14.224 --> 00:54:16.728
Not my ex-wife. never.

839
00:54:17.896 --> 00:54:20.832
But you're gonna tell me
what the fuck is going on

840
00:54:20.865 --> 00:54:22.834
or I swear to God.

841
00:54:24.668 --> 00:54:27.705
- It unlocks a room that has a machine in it.
- And?

842
00:54:31.943 --> 00:54:37.182
It can. you know. like. rewind.

843
00:54:37.215 --> 00:54:40.885
Are you talking about
like. a video store?

844
00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:44.856
That we've been
chasing down the key

845
00:54:44.889 --> 00:54:47.226
to a goddamn blockbuster
this whole time?

846
00:54:47.858 --> 00:54:49.727
You can like.

847
00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:53.631
go back earlier
in the night. like rewind.

848
00:55:18.155 --> 00:55:19.023
You're telling me that you...

849
00:55:19.057 --> 00:55:22.695
You currently possess a key

850
00:55:23.727 --> 00:55:24.996
that opens a room

851
00:55:26.898 --> 00:55:28.733
that houses a machine

852
00:55:30.001 --> 00:55:33.171
that lets you go back in time?

853
00:55:36.006 --> 00:55:37.175
Yes.

854
00:55:38.142 --> 00:55:39.744
Wow.

855
00:55:40.144 --> 00:55:41.780
So uh. I mean.

856
00:55:42.881 --> 00:55:45.217
you're just
straight up loony tunes.

857
00:55:45.249 --> 00:55:47.352
Fuck off.

858
00:55:47.686 --> 00:55:49.321
Was Frank your boyfriend?

859
00:55:49.354 --> 00:55:50.889
Frank?

860
00:55:52.090 --> 00:55:53.090
No.

861
00:55:53.992 --> 00:55:55.301
Was he the guy
you took the case from?

862
00:55:55.325 --> 00:55:56.961
The one you said hit you?

863
00:55:57.896 --> 00:55:59.231
It's complicated.

864
00:56:12.142 --> 00:56:13.378
Where are we going?

865
00:56:13.410 --> 00:56:14.679
You tell me.

866
00:56:14.713 --> 00:56:16.180
You're gonna show me.

867
00:56:16.213 --> 00:56:17.382
What?

868
00:56:17.749 --> 00:56:19.084
You got a fucking time machine?

869
00:56:19.117 --> 00:56:20.252
I wanna see that.

870
00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:34.465
<i>- Ancient Rome?
- No.</i>

871
00:56:34.499 --> 00:56:35.901
<i>Belle Époque?</i>

872
00:56:35.934 --> 00:56:37.235
<i>I don't know what that is.</i>

873
00:56:37.267 --> 00:56:38.035
Woodstock?

874
00:56:38.068 --> 00:56:40.237
- No.
- So when?

875
00:56:40.271 --> 00:56:42.039
You can only go as far back
as you were born.

876
00:56:42.072 --> 00:56:44.041
Jesus. why the fuck
are we driving so slow?

877
00:56:44.075 --> 00:56:46.278
I'm not capping off the
evening with a speeding ticket.

878
00:56:46.311 --> 00:56:48.280
- We can fix that.
- Uh-huh.

879
00:56:53.450 --> 00:56:55.454
So does it. you know.

880
00:56:56.820 --> 00:56:58.723
affect anything?

881
00:56:59.189 --> 00:57:01.102
You're not gonna come back
with low testosterone.

882
00:57:01.126 --> 00:57:02.894
- if that's what you mean.
- What?

883
00:57:02.927 --> 00:57:04.296
No. Uh.

884
00:57:04.329 --> 00:57:05.798
like reality.

885
00:57:06.999 --> 00:57:09.239
Aren't you supposed to be
careful not to change anything?

886
00:57:10.235 --> 00:57:12.303
I mean. then what's the point?

887
00:57:12.336 --> 00:57:14.739
Aren't you worried
that you know.

888
00:57:14.773 --> 00:57:17.742
killing Frank or meeting me...

889
00:57:18.876 --> 00:57:23.047
whatever. like totally mess up
the fabric of reality

890
00:57:23.081 --> 00:57:24.849
either yours or everybody's?

891
00:57:24.883 --> 00:57:26.318
Hasn't yet.

892
00:57:26.351 --> 00:57:28.053
How many times have you done it?

893
00:57:28.086 --> 00:57:29.421
Don't know.

894
00:57:29.454 --> 00:57:30.889
And what do you do?

895
00:57:31.456 --> 00:57:32.825
Play games and stuff.

896
00:57:34.025 --> 00:57:36.528
So just to be clear.

897
00:57:36.561 --> 00:57:40.097
you're saying you can travel
back in time

898
00:57:40.131 --> 00:57:44.436
and yet we just spent an hour
burying a guy in the desert.

899
00:57:47.372 --> 00:57:49.508
It's all part of the
experience. Rusty.

900
00:57:49.541 --> 00:57:50.441
You gotta be careful

901
00:57:50.476 --> 00:57:52.843
I know a guy who got nabbed
for assault

902
00:57:52.876 --> 00:57:54.278
before he could get to the room.

903
00:57:54.311 --> 00:57:56.814
That is some rookie shit.
I would never do that.

904
00:57:56.847 --> 00:57:58.249
Oh. I almost forgot.

905
00:58:03.188 --> 00:58:05.157
Done and done.

906
00:58:19.503 --> 00:58:21.005
What's a herald angel?

907
00:58:26.177 --> 00:58:27.813
Have we met before?

908
00:58:27.845 --> 00:58:28.546
Hmm?

909
00:58:28.579 --> 00:58:30.448
No. this is a new one.

910
00:58:31.582 --> 00:58:33.418
- And Frank?
- That's the place.

911
00:58:50.602 --> 00:58:52.137
<i>Shit.</i>

912
00:58:59.910 --> 00:59:01.412
Okay. we're almost at the house.

913
00:59:01.445 --> 00:59:03.247
so just don't fuck this up.

914
00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:04.916
You should just run this red.

915
00:59:04.948 --> 00:59:06.985
We'll gun it straight
to the house.

916
00:59:07.017 --> 00:59:08.452
I can jump us back.

917
00:59:09.287 --> 00:59:10.856
Uh-huh.

918
00:59:16.293 --> 00:59:18.062
It's green. dipshit.

919
00:59:32.910 --> 00:59:34.445
- What are you doing?
- I'll handle it.

920
00:59:35.178 --> 00:59:36.990
Wait till I get out of the car
and then book it.

921
00:59:37.014 --> 00:59:37.882
No.

922
00:59:37.916 --> 00:59:39.551
- Then let me talk.
- Absolutely not.

923
00:59:39.584 --> 00:59:40.652
I'm good with people.

924
00:59:40.684 --> 00:59:43.554
That is not a thing anyone
has said about you ever.

925
01:00:00.604 --> 01:00:02.240
- Good evening.
- Uh. good evening.

926
01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:04.541
Did I do something wrong?

927
01:00:04.575 --> 01:00:06.019
Well. you know.
you got a busted taillight

928
01:00:06.043 --> 01:00:07.244
on the driver's side there.

929
01:00:07.278 --> 01:00:08.346
Oh. really?

930
01:00:08.378 --> 01:00:09.514
Yep.

931
01:00:09.546 --> 01:00:11.615
I'm sorry. officer. uh...

932
01:00:11.648 --> 01:00:14.919
I was helping her move earlier.
so maybe it happened then.

933
01:00:14.952 --> 01:00:16.954
- Where you moving to?
- She's uh.

934
01:00:16.988 --> 01:00:19.524
she's leaving
an abusive relationship.

935
01:00:19.557 --> 01:00:21.226
She file a restraining order?

936
01:00:21.992 --> 01:00:24.328
No. but that's a good idea.
You should consider that.

937
01:00:24.361 --> 01:00:26.064
Fuck off.

938
01:00:28.499 --> 01:00:30.435
Let me see your license
and registration. please.

939
01:00:30.468 --> 01:00:31.503
Sure.

940
01:00:31.535 --> 01:00:32.970
Here you go.

941
01:00:33.271 --> 01:00:34.506
Excuse me.

942
01:00:41.412 --> 01:00:42.680
I'll be right back.

943
01:00:46.217 --> 01:00:47.261
I thought you said
you could handle it.

944
01:00:47.285 --> 01:00:49.654
I was handling it
until you opened your mouth.

945
01:00:49.686 --> 01:00:51.322
Do you know that guy?

946
01:00:51.356 --> 01:00:53.033
I don't know. They all
start to blend together.

947
01:00:53.057 --> 01:00:54.057
Uh-huh.

948
01:01:03.401 --> 01:01:04.970
- Give me your gun.
- No.

949
01:01:05.003 --> 01:01:06.939
- C'mon.
- Absolutely not.

950
01:01:09.773 --> 01:01:11.142
Okay. fine.

951
01:01:19.082 --> 01:01:20.285
Wait.

952
01:01:20.318 --> 01:01:21.687
What are you doing?

953
01:02:06.363 --> 01:02:08.465
Why the fuck
did you have to do that?

954
01:02:08.499 --> 01:02:09.534
You're welcome.

955
01:02:09.566 --> 01:02:10.568
You're welcome?

956
01:02:10.601 --> 01:02:12.303
Calm down. I can fix it.

957
01:02:12.336 --> 01:02:14.171
What? With your time machine?

958
01:02:16.374 --> 01:02:17.709
Stop whining. Come on. let's go.

959
01:02:20.311 --> 01:02:21.513
Ah!

960
01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:23.780
Stop it.

961
01:02:27.751 --> 01:02:28.751
Stop!

962
01:02:31.822 --> 01:02:33.323
We done?

963
01:02:33.356 --> 01:02:34.324
Uh-huh.

964
01:02:34.358 --> 01:02:36.461
Now. get in the fucking car
and trust me.

965
01:03:06.858 --> 01:03:07.792
This?

966
01:03:07.825 --> 01:03:09.361
Yeah.

967
01:03:14.532 --> 01:03:16.501
You've got like a murder
dungeon in there.

968
01:03:16.534 --> 01:03:17.501
Please.

969
01:03:17.535 --> 01:03:19.370
And you're near the bait.

970
01:03:19.403 --> 01:03:22.340
Some sicko is gonna make a pair
of chaps out of my leg skin?

971
01:03:22.372 --> 01:03:23.775
Gross.

972
01:03:26.744 --> 01:03:29.180
We only got like 15. 20 minutes
before the cops show up.

973
01:03:32.916 --> 01:03:35.352
And your douche wagon
kinda sticks out around here.

974
01:04:45.322 --> 01:04:47.191
I'm just gonna give you
a little taste.

975
01:05:13.751 --> 01:05:17.722
Year. month. day. time.

976
01:05:19.023 --> 01:05:20.892
And enter.

977
01:05:41.845 --> 01:05:43.280
<i>Charlotte.</i>

978
01:05:43.713 --> 01:05:44.949
<i>Who's asking?</i>

979
01:05:52.456 --> 01:05:53.456
What?

980
01:05:53.523 --> 01:05:54.592
Ah!

981
01:05:54.624 --> 01:05:55.525
Again?

982
01:05:55.559 --> 01:05:57.294
That's for not believing me.

983
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:08.372
- I mean...
- I know. right?

984
01:06:08.405 --> 01:06:11.409
Uh. I don't even know
how to process this.

985
01:06:11.441 --> 01:06:13.043
I mean. how does it even work?

986
01:06:13.077 --> 01:06:14.579
Fuck if I know.

987
01:06:14.945 --> 01:06:16.581
Come on. let's go.

988
01:06:18.548 --> 01:06:20.450
<i>Couldn't we have jumped
to before you shot him?</i>

989
01:06:20.483 --> 01:06:21.651
Nah.

990
01:06:21.684 --> 01:06:23.562
it was funnier when I got
to kick you in the nuts again.

991
01:06:23.586 --> 01:06:25.989
Do you just jump around
doing shit like this?

992
01:06:26.023 --> 01:06:27.291
Sometimes this.

993
01:06:27.325 --> 01:06:28.626
sometimes other stuff.

994
01:06:28.659 --> 01:06:29.669
One time. we went to Vegas.

995
01:06:29.693 --> 01:06:31.996
and won $800.000 in blackjack.

996
01:06:32.028 --> 01:06:33.430
Another time. we poked a hole

997
01:06:33.463 --> 01:06:35.599
in every condom
in CVS in Tarzana.

998
01:06:36.901 --> 01:06:37.869
Who's we?

999
01:06:37.901 --> 01:06:40.405
There's a bunch of us
who know about the key.

1000
01:06:40.438 --> 01:06:42.039
It's part of the game.

1001
01:06:42.072 --> 01:06:43.775
Do all of you do this?

1002
01:06:43.807 --> 01:06:45.709
- Do what?
- Kill cops and shit.

1003
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:48.321
Well. you're acting like
it's a permanent thing.

1004
01:06:48.345 --> 01:06:49.179
It's not a permanent thing.

1005
01:06:49.213 --> 01:06:50.457
we can always go back
and change it.

1006
01:06:50.481 --> 01:06:51.448
But you never thought.

1007
01:06:51.481 --> 01:06:53.317
"Well. maybe I should
stop 9/11 or something."

1008
01:06:53.351 --> 01:06:57.854
Okay. so you're telling me
if you had one chance.

1009
01:06:57.887 --> 01:07:01.625
one chance to time travel.
that's the moment you choose?

1010
01:07:11.535 --> 01:07:13.071
I don't know when I choose.

1011
01:07:13.738 --> 01:07:15.073
See?

1012
01:07:15.539 --> 01:07:16.749
You wanna act all high
and mighty.

1013
01:07:16.773 --> 01:07:19.777
but you ask anyone one wish.

1014
01:07:21.678 --> 01:07:23.514
And you know what
they're not wishing for?

1015
01:07:24.981 --> 01:07:26.784
World peace.

1016
01:07:39.798 --> 01:07:43.068
Mmm. I love the smell
of the woods.

1017
01:07:58.448 --> 01:08:00.151
You still have that cop's gun?

1018
01:08:00.184 --> 01:08:01.586
Yeah.

1019
01:08:06.423 --> 01:08:07.458
What the fuck?!

1020
01:08:07.492 --> 01:08:10.628
Seems foolish to have evidence
on you like that.

1021
01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:12.729
Oh. Rusty.

1022
01:08:12.762 --> 01:08:16.601
I don't waste one brain cell
worrying about that shit.

1023
01:08:16.634 --> 01:08:17.769
Must be nice.

1024
01:08:17.802 --> 01:08:19.036
It is.

1025
01:08:37.554 --> 01:08:38.834
Where do you think you're going?

1026
01:08:39.723 --> 01:08:40.959
I thought we were going back.

1027
01:08:41.925 --> 01:08:42.826
Back where?

1028
01:08:42.861 --> 01:08:44.961
Before the cop...
before I killed Frank.

1029
01:08:44.995 --> 01:08:47.564
before you killed Frank
a second time. I don't know.

1030
01:08:47.598 --> 01:08:48.700
Nah-uh.

1031
01:09:07.518 --> 01:09:08.520
What?

1032
01:09:09.786 --> 01:09:11.555
You're welcome to stay
here if you like.

1033
01:09:11.589 --> 01:09:13.732
but I'm pretty sure the cops
are gonna show up any minute.

1034
01:09:13.756 --> 01:09:14.724
No. no. no. no. no. no.

1035
01:09:14.758 --> 01:09:16.094
We're fixing all this.

1036
01:09:16.626 --> 01:09:18.696
It's been a fun ride. Rusty.
but it's over.

1037
01:09:22.165 --> 01:09:23.668
You're pinning all this on me?

1038
01:09:23.701 --> 01:09:24.803
You said I was deviant.

1039
01:09:27.271 --> 01:09:28.706
And you were right.

1040
01:10:12.316 --> 01:10:13.251
Ah!

1041
01:10:13.284 --> 01:10:14.853
Ah!

1042
01:10:25.094 --> 01:10:26.129
Oh shit.

1043
01:10:27.665 --> 01:10:28.900
Where is it?

1044
01:10:32.670 --> 01:10:34.672
<i>Rusty. you motherfucker.
let me in!</i>

1045
01:10:34.705 --> 01:10:36.707
<i>You don't deserve it.
it's all garbage.</i>

1046
01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:37.784
<i>Everything you do with it
is garbage.</i>

1047
01:10:37.808 --> 01:10:39.977
You preachy fuck.
just let me in!

1048
01:10:40.009 --> 01:10:41.978
<i>No. No fucking way.</i>

1049
01:10:42.012 --> 01:10:43.648
Okay.

1050
01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:45.950
<i>Okay. fine. we go together.
We go back together.</i>

1051
01:10:45.982 --> 01:10:48.552
<i>I can take you back
to before we met</i>

1052
01:10:48.585 --> 01:10:50.954
<i>and uh. I'll get an Uber
or something.</i>

1053
01:10:50.987 --> 01:10:53.857
<i>and you can go back
to your pathetic taxi life!</i>

1054
01:10:56.927 --> 01:10:58.896
Russell!

1055
01:11:18.616 --> 01:11:19.951
Go! Go. go. go. go. go!

1056
01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:25.289
Charlotte!

1057
01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:46.430
What? You just do this
driving shit for fun?

1058
01:13:48.965 --> 01:13:51.369
<i>I let my partner buy me out.</i>

1059
01:14:04.881 --> 01:14:06.750
- Can I get a black and tan?
- Yeah.

1060
01:14:11.789 --> 01:14:13.057
- You mind?
- Not at all.

1061
01:14:25.035 --> 01:14:26.303
Waiting for somebody?

1062
01:14:26.335 --> 01:14:28.472
Yeah.

1063
01:14:28.504 --> 01:14:30.206
Super flaky chick.

1064
01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:32.120
Sometimes it's better
if they don't show at all.

1065
01:14:33.043 --> 01:14:34.144
Ain't that the truth?

1066
01:14:35.012 --> 01:14:37.247
How about you?

1067
01:14:38.214 --> 01:14:39.449
Nah.

1068
01:14:40.049 --> 01:14:43.754
I'm uh. celebrating alone.

1069
01:14:44.521 --> 01:14:46.090
What you celebrating?

1070
01:14:46.956 --> 01:14:50.026
This app I invented
is about to go public.

1071
01:14:51.594 --> 01:14:53.063
Fuck. man.

1072
01:14:53.964 --> 01:14:55.866
- I got that one.
- Yep.

1073
01:14:55.898 --> 01:14:57.468
Thanks.

1074
01:15:00.536 --> 01:15:02.138
To new beginnings.

1075
01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:05.242
New beginnings.
