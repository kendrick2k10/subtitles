5
00:00:48.734 --> 00:00:51.166
I'm sorry. did you
just whistle at me?

6
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.367
I never could resist
a man in uniform?

7
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.100
It's the hat. isn't it?

8
00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:00.934
Not everybody can pull this off.

9
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.000
Hi.

10
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:10.000
Hi.

11
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:11.166
I missed you.

12
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.667
I missed you too.
How was New York?

13
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.066
For the 20 minutes that
I was there. very nice.

14
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.734
Terminal H has new carpeting.

15
00:01:18.867 --> 00:01:19.900
Ooh!

16
00:01:20.033 --> 00:01:21.000
Oh.

17
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.000
Chocolates? It's
not even my birthday.

18
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:29.200
Well. it was that or the
iHeart New York T-shirt. so.

19
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:30.734
Hm.

20
00:01:30.867 --> 00:01:32.500
But don't eat too many of
those. Willie's really excited.

21
00:01:32.633 --> 00:01:34.233
that you're joining
us for dinner.

22
00:01:34.367 --> 00:01:35.667
That makes two of us.

23
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.400
Mrs. Hecht is making risotto.

24
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:39.834
Ooh!

25
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.333
I was wondering if
you had a minute.

26
00:01:46.467 --> 00:01:48.567
if you could take
a look at this?

27
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.400
Andie. once you're an attendee
and part of the practice.

28
00:01:53.533 --> 00:01:55.900
you don't have to write
annual goals any longer.

29
00:01:56.033 --> 00:01:58.834
That ended a year ago
with your residency.

30
00:01:58.967 --> 00:02:01.100
I-I know I don't have to.

31
00:02:01.233 --> 00:02:02.967
but a roadmap to
professional success

32
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.633
should have guideposts.

33
00:02:04.767 --> 00:02:06.900
And a one. five
and 10-year plan?

34
00:02:09.367 --> 00:02:12.800
"Be part of the Peer
Review Committee?"

35
00:02:12.934 --> 00:02:15.467
Oh. they discuss
the toughest cases.

36
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.967
as a resident. we
do patient rounds

37
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.066
with other doctors
to keep learning.

38
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.066
Peer review would ensure
continued educational growth.

39
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.767
"Eventual fellowship
for a subspecialty

40
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.567
in congenital heart disease?"

41
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.467
Well. you've got all the
makings to achieve it.

42
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.467
Cadillac education.
dedication to the work.

43
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.734
solid support system.
you're doing fine.

44
00:02:35.867 --> 00:02:36.967
Come on. there
must be something.

45
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.266
that I need to be working on.

46
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.900
Your penmanship. might
be worse than mine.

47
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.233
It'll be okay. sweetheart.

48
00:02:53.367 --> 00:02:54.734
I'll see soon.

49
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.467
Hey. Andie.

50
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.867
he came into the Emergency
Room about 30 minutes ago.

51
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.200
we got him up here
as fast as we could.

52
00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:13.300
Okay. thanks.

53
00:03:23.333 --> 00:03:24.300
Hey. my friend.

54
00:03:25.767 --> 00:03:28.367
My knight in pale blue armor.

55
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.667
The office said you
were on your day off

56
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.867
and Dr. Fisher had
to do the procedure.

57
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.967
Yeah. well.
angiograms pay a lot

58
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.066
and I got my eye on a new car.

59
00:03:38.433 --> 00:03:41.033
Your EKG shows evidence
of some heart damage.

60
00:03:41.166 --> 00:03:43.800
the main artery may be blocked.
I'll do my best to open it.

61
00:03:43.934 --> 00:03:46.166
but you may require
open heart surgery.

62
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.000
I'm gonna do everything I can

63
00:03:48.133 --> 00:03:50.033
to get you on the other
side of this. okay. Oscar.

64
00:03:50.166 --> 00:03:52.967
I know you will. Doctor.

65
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.166
Up first is a little bit of
numbing medication. lidocaine.

66
00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.800
you may notice a little
bit of a burning sensation.

67
00:03:58.934 --> 00:04:01.767
it's gonna be a slight
pinch. all totally normal.

68
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.433
We're injecting the contrast.

69
00:04:06.567 --> 00:04:09.266
You're doing great. Oscar.

70
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.734
Where do you feel the pain?

71
00:04:11.867 --> 00:04:13.200
All over my chest.

72
00:04:13.333 --> 00:04:15.967
Blood pressure's
dropping. 90 over 60.

73
00:04:17.734 --> 00:04:21.767
Oscar. how long have you
and Gloria been married?

74
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.934
52 years.

75
00:04:23.066 --> 00:04:24.934
Wow. congratulations.

76
00:04:25.066 --> 00:04:28.000
Can you tell me a favorite
story you have about your wife?

77
00:04:29.667 --> 00:04:35.266
Our 25th anniversary. we
spent it on a 24-foot sailboat.

78
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.767
She loves the ocean.

79
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.033
She reminded me
of the day we met.

80
00:04:39.166 --> 00:04:40.767
Blood pressure's
dropping again.

81
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.033
Alert
the surgical team.

82
00:04:43.166 --> 00:04:44.567
Can you tell me anything else

83
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.467
you remember about
that day. Oscar?

84
00:04:47.533 --> 00:04:50.867
The boat keels over.

85
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.700
I see my Gloria's face.

86
00:04:53.834 --> 00:04:59.033
hair blowing away in the wind.

87
00:04:59.166 --> 00:05:01.166
Is he okay?

88
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.800
Oscar did great. he's
just in postop recovering.

89
00:05:03.934 --> 00:05:05.600
There was almost 100% blockage

90
00:05:05.734 --> 00:05:07.166
in the main artery to his heart.

91
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.333
We were able to get in there
and place a metal stint.

92
00:05:09.467 --> 00:05:10.333
that should help keep it open.

93
00:05:10.467 --> 00:05:11.767
Oh. thank God.

94
00:05:13.133 --> 00:05:15.800
He was so pale. I thought.

95
00:05:15.934 --> 00:05:17.000
You did the right thing.

96
00:05:17.133 --> 00:05:19.333
when you called
911. you saved him.

97
00:05:19.467 --> 00:05:22.767
He's going to be a
great-grandfather soon.

98
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.333
did he tell you that?

99
00:05:24.467 --> 00:05:28.100
I want more than anything for
him to meet that little baby.

100
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.433
He will.

101
00:05:31.567 --> 00:05:33.000
Thank you.

102
00:05:33.133 --> 00:05:35.867
You're welcome. you should
be able to see him soon.

103
00:06:00.133 --> 00:06:01.000
Yeah.

104
00:06:01.133 --> 00:06:02.934
Henny. honey.

105
00:06:04.166 --> 00:06:06.567
I'm here.

106
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.000
I got lasagna. meatloaf.

107
00:06:10.133 --> 00:06:15.333
all you gotta do is heat it up.

108
00:06:15.467 --> 00:06:19.567
Thinking three
minutes should do it.

109
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.100
Yeah. three
minutes should do it.

110
00:06:26.033 --> 00:06:28.000
Right over left. so
that the wide part is-

111
00:06:28.133 --> 00:06:30.100
Yeah. yeah. yeah. I can do it.

112
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.400
They always make you
wear a tie to work?

113
00:06:36.533 --> 00:06:38.567
No. I-I like it.

114
00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.066
I talked to Miss
Thompson today.

115
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.867
she said you're doing
a real fine job.

116
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.166
You like working
at the bookstore?

117
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.900
- Yeah.
- Are they treating you nice?

118
00:06:50.033 --> 00:06:52.834
Yeah. real nice.

119
00:06:52.967 --> 00:06:54.233
Perfect.

120
00:06:54.367 --> 00:06:56.266
Let me fix your collar for you.

121
00:06:58.367 --> 00:07:00.967
Oh. my handsome boy.

122
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.266
I'm not gonna keep you.

123
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.033
Oh. are we still on for the
movies on Sunday. your pick?

124
00:07:08.433 --> 00:07:09.567
"Spider-Man."

125
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:10.567
Oh.

126
00:07:11.767 --> 00:07:12.734
Again?

127
00:07:12.867 --> 00:07:14.300
Yeah. again.

128
00:07:14.433 --> 00:07:18.433
Okay. fine. fine and
I'll get you the big bucket

129
00:07:18.567 --> 00:07:19.967
of popcorn just like you like.

130
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.900
And Milk Duds.

131
00:07:22.033 --> 00:07:26.100
Oh. come on. I never forget
the Milk Duds. come here.

132
00:07:26.233 --> 00:07:28.400
Oh. this boy. I love him.

133
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.066
I'll see you soon.

134
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.900
Yeah. bye. Ma.

135
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.800
Come on. guys.
get it back. get it back!

136
00:08:05.934 --> 00:08:07.300
What I miss?

137
00:08:07.433 --> 00:08:09.300
Oh. oh. not much. not
much. they just put him in.

138
00:08:09.433 --> 00:08:11.467
Let's go. Will. whoo!

139
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.300
Come on. come on. come
on. come on. come on!

140
00:08:14.433 --> 00:08:15.467
Oh.

141
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.967
It's okay. Will. you got this!

142
00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.467
- Come on. bud.
- Come on!

143
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.967
You got it!

144
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.200
Yeah!

145
00:08:26.333 --> 00:08:27.700
Whoo. whoo!

146
00:08:30.266 --> 00:08:32.867
Okay. you're gonna have
to show me how you do that.

147
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.033
Hey.

148
00:08:39.166 --> 00:08:41.333
Nice work. buddy. big win.

149
00:08:41.467 --> 00:08:42.967
I only played two minutes.

150
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.934
Yeah. but it was the best
two minutes of the game.

151
00:08:47.133 --> 00:08:49.300
I don't think I
wanna play anymore.

152
00:08:49.433 --> 00:08:51.967
Everyone's bigger
than me and faster.

153
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.533
Yeah. but you can do
things that they can't.

154
00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:57.033
Yeah. well. I've seen
you kick the ball a mile.

155
00:08:57.166 --> 00:08:59.400
Can't kick the
ball from the bench.

156
00:09:01.667 --> 00:09:05.200
What's gotten into you
today. you feeling okay. pal?

157
00:09:05.333 --> 00:09:06.700
Oh.

158
00:09:06.834 --> 00:09:08.700
Oh. I think
someone's coming down

159
00:09:08.834 --> 00:09:10.100
with a bad case of the blues.

160
00:09:10.233 --> 00:09:11.700
Uh-oh. is it serious?

161
00:09:11.834 --> 00:09:12.934
Very.

162
00:09:13.066 --> 00:09:14.767
Well. what's your
prognosis. Doctor?

163
00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:18.266
Symptoms could worsen.
so I would recommend

164
00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.934
a hot fudge sundae
from Bennigan's stat.

165
00:09:22.066 --> 00:09:23.934
Really? Can I
get three scoops?

166
00:09:24.066 --> 00:09:25.266
Hey. don't push
your luck. pal.

167
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.367
Come on.

168
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.066
You know I won't make you do
something you don't want to.

169
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.600
but I think you
should stick with it.

170
00:09:32.734 --> 00:09:34.934
And for the record. I
think you are pretty great

171
00:09:35.066 --> 00:09:36.767
just the way you are.

172
00:09:39.667 --> 00:09:43.200
Oh my goodness. what
happened?

173
00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:44.400
We won.

174
00:09:44.533 --> 00:09:47.033
I'd hate to see what
losing looks like.

175
00:09:47.166 --> 00:09:49.567
Come on. mister. we
gotta get you cleaned up.

176
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.533
- No. but I-
- Hey. you heard Mrs. Hecht.

177
00:09:51.667 --> 00:09:53.066
- Think fast.
- Oh.

178
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.367
Bath time. buddy.

179
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:55.367
Fine.

180
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.533
See you. Andie.

181
00:09:57.567 --> 00:09:59.033
- See you.
- Come on.

182
00:09:59.166 --> 00:10:00.266
See you. guys. take care.

183
00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.667
Come on. mister.
let's march. let's go.

184
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.367
I. um. I'd better get
going too. it's getting late.

185
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.533
- Okay.
- We still on for tomorrow?

186
00:10:09.667 --> 00:10:10.867
I wouldn't miss it.

187
00:10:29.333 --> 00:10:30.200
Henry.

188
00:10:30.333 --> 00:10:32.200
You ready to come back?

189
00:10:36.834 --> 00:10:40.200
I didn't see your mom
in the waiting room.

190
00:10:40.333 --> 00:10:42.700
No. because she's at work.

191
00:10:42.834 --> 00:10:45.200
because I don't live
with her anymore.

192
00:10:46.867 --> 00:10:51.066
I heard you moved
to the Briarwood Park
apartments. right?

193
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:56.000
Yeah. I finished all the
workshops at the Adult Center

194
00:10:56.133 --> 00:10:59.400
on how. how to live on my own

195
00:10:59.533 --> 00:11:02.433
and that's what I do now.

196
00:11:02.567 --> 00:11:03.767
That's. ah. that's great.

197
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.100
I bet you're making
a lot of friends.

198
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.633
Yeah. I have two
friends on my floor

199
00:11:10.767 --> 00:11:13.767
and three friends
on the second floor.

200
00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:18.667
Cathy. Roger. Eduardo.

201
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.300
Esther and Louie.

202
00:11:21.433 --> 00:11:23.633
Can you take a few
deep breaths for me?

203
00:11:23.767 --> 00:11:25.934
Yeah.

204
00:11:26.066 --> 00:11:28.767
And how's
the breathing been?

205
00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:30.266
It seems good.

206
00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.100
You noticed any chest pain?

207
00:11:35.266 --> 00:11:36.300
No.

208
00:11:36.433 --> 00:11:38.367
Have you been
feeling tired at all?

209
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:45.333
N-no. but sometimes
the room spins.

210
00:11:45.467 --> 00:11:47.633
The room spins?

211
00:11:47.767 --> 00:11:50.000
Yeah. like the spin

212
00:11:50.133 --> 00:11:54.467
when you get off the
teacups at Disneyland.

213
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.767
I really like those teacups.

214
00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.834
Yeah. me too.

215
00:11:59.967 --> 00:12:01.333
Could you take off your glasses?

216
00:12:01.467 --> 00:12:03.233
I just wanna check
your eyes really quick.

217
00:12:03.367 --> 00:12:04.333
Yeah.

218
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.834
Does it ever feel like
the window shades may be

219
00:12:09.967 --> 00:12:14.333
being pulled down or it
gets kind of dark or gray?

220
00:12:14.467 --> 00:12:18.734
No. except when I
really pull it down.

221
00:12:18.867 --> 00:12:21.734
but one time it got
really dark and spinny

222
00:12:21.867 --> 00:12:24.433
and I woke up on the floor.

223
00:12:25.467 --> 00:12:28.333
Like it went all. all black?

224
00:12:28.467 --> 00:12:31.500
Did it feel like you went
to sleep for a little bit?

225
00:12:31.633 --> 00:12:32.667
Yeah.

226
00:12:33.867 --> 00:12:37.066
And how did you
feel when you woke up?

227
00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.834
I felt sleepy.

228
00:12:40.667 --> 00:12:43.567
Has this ever happened
to you before. Henry?

229
00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.834
Um. n-no. I don't think so.

230
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.834
Okay. um. look. the good news

231
00:12:50.967 --> 00:12:54.400
is that your EKG shows the
same irregular heartbeat.

232
00:12:54.533 --> 00:12:57.166
that you've had
for several years.

233
00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:59.166
I wanna send you
home on a monitor.

234
00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.734
so we can get a better
idea of what's going on.

235
00:13:01.867 --> 00:13:03.400
if. if that's okay with you.

236
00:13:04.433 --> 00:13:05.300
Yeah.

237
00:13:05.433 --> 00:13:06.300
Yeah?

238
00:13:06.433 --> 00:13:07.767
Okay.
- Yeah.

239
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.300
You are going to have this
wrapped around your chest.

240
00:13:09.433 --> 00:13:11.900
even when you go to
sleep or take a shower.

241
00:13:12.033 --> 00:13:13.400
you need to leave it on.

242
00:13:13.533 --> 00:13:15.934
Careful. Nurse
Riya has cold hands.

243
00:13:16.066 --> 00:13:17.934
But a warm heart.

244
00:13:18.066 --> 00:13:18.934
Oh!

245
00:13:19.066 --> 00:13:21.734
Her h-hands really are cold.

246
00:13:32.266 --> 00:13:35.734
Is that a stegosaurus?

247
00:13:35.867 --> 00:13:40.633
Y-yeah. they have spike tails.

248
00:13:40.767 --> 00:13:43.967
they use it to
fight off predators.

249
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.100
I used to have
one just like that.

250
00:13:46.233 --> 00:13:48.433
My favorite dinosaurs
were always the ones.

251
00:13:48.567 --> 00:13:51.066
that would rather eat
a salad than eat me.

252
00:13:52.667 --> 00:13:53.667
Than eat you.

253
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:59.233
Yeah. they lived in
the Jurassic period

254
00:13:59.367 --> 00:14:02.467
200 million years ago.

255
00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.367
Wow!

256
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.834
So the monitor. you're just
gonna wear it for the weekend

257
00:14:07.967 --> 00:14:09.633
and then you can come
back in on Monday

258
00:14:09.767 --> 00:14:11.133
and we'll take a look.

259
00:14:11.266 --> 00:14:12.867
I can give your mom a call
then too and fill her in.

260
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.433
if. if that's okay with you?
- Yeah. okay.

261
00:14:16.667 --> 00:14:18.467
If you feel any more spinning.

262
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.333
I want you to
write it down here.

263
00:14:20.467 --> 00:14:22.700
write down what time
and what you're doing

264
00:14:22.834 --> 00:14:24.500
and if the symptoms
get any worse.

265
00:14:24.633 --> 00:14:27.300
here's my cell phone and I
want you to call me. okay.

266
00:14:27.433 --> 00:14:29.800
it means you need to
be seen right away

267
00:14:31.166 --> 00:14:34.133
and by symptoms worsening.
I mean dizziness

268
00:14:34.266 --> 00:14:36.333
or trouble breathing or
you run out of energy.

269
00:14:36.467 --> 00:14:38.533
I've written it all
down right here for you.

270
00:14:38.667 --> 00:14:40.800
Does that make sense. Henry?

271
00:14:40.934 --> 00:14:43.200
Yeah. makes sense.

272
00:14:43.333 --> 00:14:46.300
So what kind of things are
you doing this weekend. Henry?

273
00:14:47.667 --> 00:14:49.633
Do puzzles

274
00:14:49.767 --> 00:14:53.133
and. and go to the 7 and Eleven

275
00:14:53.266 --> 00:14:55.367
to get chips and a soda.

276
00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:59.200
Well. just try to take it
easy. no hard exercising.

277
00:14:59.333 --> 00:15:02.266
Um. can I walk?
Because I like to walk.

278
00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.767
For sure.

279
00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:08.033
Because sometimes I walk
5.000 steps in one day.

280
00:15:08.166 --> 00:15:10.533
my. my watch tells me.

281
00:15:10.667 --> 00:15:12.867
but some days I don't.

282
00:15:14.233 --> 00:15:19.700
Um. this is for you
since it's your favorite.

283
00:15:19.834 --> 00:15:22.400
Oh. thank you. Henry.

284
00:15:22.533 --> 00:15:24.066
It means a lot.

285
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.600
You're welcome.

286
00:15:25.734 --> 00:15:28.200
I'll take good care of her.

287
00:15:28.333 --> 00:15:30.400
Yeah.

288
00:15:31.734 --> 00:15:32.700
Hey!

289
00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:36.433
So how's the cake?

290
00:15:36.567 --> 00:15:38.433
Are you asking me.
because you'd like some?

291
00:15:38.567 --> 00:15:40.266
I'm just. you know. curious.

292
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.433
Hm. it is very good.

293
00:15:43.567 --> 00:15:46.867
Ooh!

294
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.266
There you go.

295
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.433
- Finally.
- Mm-hm.

296
00:15:50.567 --> 00:15:52.200
Why don't we come
here more often?

297
00:15:52.333 --> 00:15:55.200
I haven't been here
since our second date.

298
00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:57.767
Third date.

299
00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.533
It was definitely our second.

300
00:15:59.667 --> 00:16:01.767
I remember because that's
the night that you kissed me.

301
00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.500
Ah. you mean you kissed me?

302
00:16:03.633 --> 00:16:05.667
Hm. that's not
how I remember it.

303
00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:10.700

Henry. what's wrong?

332
00:18:32.033 --> 00:18:35.734
I. I. I. I got a
list from Dr. Hodges

333
00:18:35.867 --> 00:18:39.934
of things to call her for. I
had one of the things on list.

334
00:18:40.066 --> 00:18:41.567
Which one?

335
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:45.400
It got really gray. like
a shade being pulled down.

336
00:18:45.533 --> 00:18:48.967
except I didn't pull
it down and. and dizzy.

337
00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:50.467
I'd better call her.

338
00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.967
Call her right now.

339
00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:55.266
you do exactly what she tells
you to do. I'm on my way.

340
00:19:04.467 --> 00:19:05.433
Thanks.

341
00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.867
Oh. thank you.

342
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.533
Who's it from?
- Congratulations!

343
00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:18.200
Free champagne. we should
get engaged more often.

344
00:19:18.333 --> 00:19:20.700
You might be onto something.

345
00:19:20.834 --> 00:19:23.133
You've reached
Dr. Andrea Hodges.

346
00:19:23.266 --> 00:19:25.033
Please leave a message.

347
00:19:25.166 --> 00:19:30.800
Dr. Hodges. I
don't feel right. um.

What's wrong?

352
00:19:55.767 --> 00:19:57.533
A patient. I missed his calls.

353
00:19:57.667 --> 00:19:58.867
I thought you weren't
on call tonight?

354
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.367
I'm not. but I gave
him my phone number

355
00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:01.467
in case of emergency.

356
00:20:05.633 --> 00:20:10.300
Hey. Manny. um. I'm looking
for a patient. Henry Larkin.

357
00:20:10.433 --> 00:20:12.700
Ah. EMTs brought him in
about half an hour ago.

358
00:20:12.834 --> 00:20:14.500
He came by ambulance?

359
00:20:14.633 --> 00:20:16.967
Yeah. single car
accident on Highway one.

360
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:19.800
he was driving and
hit a power pole.

361
00:20:19.934 --> 00:20:22.166
He was driving.
you're. you're positive?

362
00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:23.433
Talked to his mother

363
00:20:23.567 --> 00:20:26.934
and she said that he
called her in a panic.

364
00:20:28.633 --> 00:20:31.967
I didn't. I didn't
think he drove.

365
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:35.533
Um. sorry. where is he now?

366
00:20:35.667 --> 00:20:39.200
Oh. I'm sorry. Andie.
he didn't make it.

367
00:20:48.633 --> 00:20:52.600
che)

368
00:20:56.367 --> 00:20:59.567
The emergency doctor
said that it was probably

369
00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.633
just instantaneous. said
he didn't feel any pain.

370
00:21:02.767 --> 00:21:04.400
How could this happen?

371
00:21:04.533 --> 00:21:08.633
He was supposed to call
his doctor and I just.

372
00:21:08.767 --> 00:21:11.800
I don't understand how she
said to get behind the wheel.

373
00:21:11.934 --> 00:21:13.800
You shouldn't be by yourself.

374
00:21:13.934 --> 00:21:16.900
Now why don't you stay
with me and Bill tonight?

375
00:21:17.033 --> 00:21:18.400
We can figure it out tomorrow.

376
00:21:18.533 --> 00:21:21.233
What am I gonna do
without my Henny?

377
00:21:21.367 --> 00:21:22.233
Ssh. ssh!

378
00:21:56.567 --> 00:21:57.734
Hi. Andie.

379
00:21:57.867 --> 00:22:00.367
Hi. Laura. um. nobody
answered the front door.

380
00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.500
so I thought I might
find you back here.

381
00:22:02.633 --> 00:22:04.667
Go ahead. he's in
his workshop as usual.

382
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.066
Go right on in.
- Thanks.

383
00:22:14.967 --> 00:22:16.467
You looking for feedback

384
00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.600
on your one. five
or 10-year plan?

385
00:22:25.467 --> 00:22:28.333
He was experiencing recent
symptoms. nothing severe.

386
00:22:28.467 --> 00:22:31.333
just mild dizziness. so I
sent him home on a monitor.

387
00:22:31.467 --> 00:22:33.333
I'd have done the same thing.

388
00:22:33.467 --> 00:22:35.467
I told him not
to exert himself.

389
00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.467
but I didn't tell him
that he shouldn't drive.

390
00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:42.867
Henry was intellectually
disabled. I didn't
think he drove.

391
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.767
then I found this.

392
00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.834
It was in his patient file
along with his recent EKG

393
00:22:50.967 --> 00:22:53.800
and med list. I should
have said don't drive.

394
00:22:53.934 --> 00:22:56.033
Did you tell him to
call. if he felt worse?

395
00:22:56.166 --> 00:22:57.400
O-of course.

396
00:22:58.934 --> 00:23:01.767
but I gave him my cell. so
he could reach me directly.

397
00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.033
He gets nervous when
he talks to someone.

398
00:23:04.166 --> 00:23:07.600
that he doesn't know. he
called just like I told him to.

399
00:23:07.734 --> 00:23:09.400
but I-I missed the calls.
- Did he know

400
00:23:09.533 --> 00:23:11.834
to call the exchange. if
he couldn't reach you?

401
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.400
Um...

402
00:23:16.533 --> 00:23:19.033
Okay. alright. hold on. Andie.

403
00:23:19.166 --> 00:23:20.900
You're their doctor.
not their friend.

404
00:23:21.033 --> 00:23:22.433
you can't know every detail

405
00:23:22.567 --> 00:23:24.200
about every one
of your patients.

406
00:23:24.333 --> 00:23:25.567
If he was any other patient.

407
00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.033
I would've assumed that he drove

408
00:23:27.166 --> 00:23:28.934
and told him that he shouldn't.

409
00:23:29.066 --> 00:23:30.567
Just. just breathe.

410
00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.367
At this moment. you
can't do anything.

411
00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:33.767
How am I gonna
face his mother?

412
00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:35.934
What. what. what
do I even tell her?

413
00:23:36.066 --> 00:23:37.033
Nothing.

414
00:23:38.633 --> 00:23:42.900
You say nothing. there's a
procedure in these situations.

415
00:23:43.033 --> 00:23:45.533
What. Henry Larkin's mother's

416
00:23:45.667 --> 00:23:48.200
gonna get a letter in the mail?

417
00:23:48.333 --> 00:23:50.266
She deserves to hear it from me.

418
00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.433
Families can interpret
that as an admission of guilt

419
00:23:53.567 --> 00:23:55.100
and if they don't.

420
00:23:55.233 --> 00:23:57.633
their lawyer will make
that association for them.

421
00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:02.433
Just. just file a
report. go from there.

422
00:24:16.567 --> 00:24:18.100
Hey. I've been call...

423
00:24:19.934 --> 00:24:21.333
You okay?

424
00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:34.033
Come inside.

425
00:24:36.066 --> 00:24:40.567
Henry was always
so sweet and kind.

426
00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.967
He had just moved
into his own apartment

427
00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:47.934
and he had a job and was
making all these friends.

428
00:24:50.934 --> 00:24:54.100
He had worked so hard.

429
00:24:54.233 --> 00:24:55.600
I'm so sorry that
you're going through this.

430
00:24:55.734 --> 00:24:58.400
I have a responsibility
to do no harm.

431
00:25:01.133 --> 00:25:04.333
He trusted me

432
00:25:04.467 --> 00:25:05.867
and I failed him.

433
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.800
Don't you think you're being
a little hard on yourself?

434
00:25:11.367 --> 00:25:15.567
Did you talk with Dr. Fisher?

435
00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:19.533
He said I should let the
malpractice insurance carrier

436
00:25:19.667 --> 00:25:21.166
handle it from here.

437
00:25:22.633 --> 00:25:25.867
But that doesn't
sound right to you?

438
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.667
To make a mistake
and then just carry on

439
00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.166
like nothing happened?

440
00:25:32.633 --> 00:25:35.667
No.

441
00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:39.166
So what are you gonna do?

442
00:25:54.133 --> 00:25:58.400
Hi. um. Mrs. Larkin. I
don't know if you remember me.

443
00:25:58.533 --> 00:26:01.567
but I'm Henry's
doctor. Andrea Hodges.

444
00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:02.834
I know who you are.

445
00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.633
I. um. just came over.

446
00:26:06.767 --> 00:26:07.900
because I wanted to
talk to you about-

447
00:26:08.033 --> 00:26:09.934
What is there to talk about?

448
00:26:10.066 --> 00:26:12.800
He said you gave him a list.

449
00:26:12.934 --> 00:26:15.266
you said to watch
the symptoms on it.

450
00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.834
he did exactly what you said.

451
00:26:19.033 --> 00:26:20.467
I-I told him if he
started experiencing-

452
00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.200
But how could you let
him drive to the hospital?

453
00:26:25.734 --> 00:26:29.567
Mrs. Larkin.

454
00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:30.734
I didn't know.

455
00:26:30.867 --> 00:26:32.233
Isn't that something
that a doctor

456
00:26:32.367 --> 00:26:34.066
should know about her patient?

457
00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.967
Isn't that something
that would be in a file?

458
00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:38.767
You did know that he was doing

459
00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:41.233
independent living
classes. right?

460
00:26:42.433 --> 00:26:44.900
Yes.

461
00:26:45.033 --> 00:26:46.900
He always walked to the office.

462
00:26:47.033 --> 00:26:48.633
he talked about walking to work.

463
00:26:48.767 --> 00:26:50.433
I. I just never thought to ask.

464
00:26:50.567 --> 00:26:53.133
Do you even know
how the DMV decides.

465
00:26:53.266 --> 00:26:56.000
if someone like
Henry could drive?

466
00:26:58.367 --> 00:27:00.867
Of course not. you just assumed

467
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.467
that he had a low
IQ and he couldn't.

468
00:27:05.767 --> 00:27:10.367
If you knew he drove.

469
00:27:13.166 --> 00:27:16.367
would you have told him not to?

470
00:27:20.433 --> 00:27:22.567
Yes. yes.

471
00:27:24.667 --> 00:27:29.500
What are you
doing here. really?

472
00:27:29.633 --> 00:27:31.667
I...

473
00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:35.033
I just. I just feel terrible.

474
00:27:35.166 --> 00:27:38.700
So nothing to do
with me or my son.

475
00:27:38.834 --> 00:27:42.133
just come to unburden yourself?

476
00:27:42.266 --> 00:27:44.033
No. no. no. that's
not what I meant.

477
00:27:44.166 --> 00:27:46.467
I don't have anything
else to say to you.

478
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.500
Can you take another
deep breath for me?

479
00:28:10.433 --> 00:28:11.333
And another?

480
00:28:17.333 --> 00:28:20.033
Are you hearing something bad?

481
00:28:20.166 --> 00:28:23.000
Do you notice any trouble
when getting a full breath?

482
00:28:23.133 --> 00:28:24.367
No.

483
00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.200
What about after
you climb some stairs?

484
00:28:27.333 --> 00:28:31.567
No more than usual. I know
I'm not in the best shape.

485
00:28:34.667 --> 00:28:36.700
What about at night.
Selma. can you breathe

486
00:28:36.834 --> 00:28:39.367
the same as usual when
you're lying flat in bed?

487
00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.867
Yes.

488
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.200
Do you use any pillows to help

489
00:28:43.333 --> 00:28:45.867
or notice any
swelling in your feet?

490
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.567
No and no.

491
00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.200
What's going on?

492
00:29:00.233 --> 00:29:01.200
Andie.

493
00:29:02.734 --> 00:29:05.367
Selma Yiarkim was up front
scheduling some scans and tests.

494
00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:07.266
is she doing okay?

495
00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.600
Yeah. I. ah. I just thought
I heard some crackling

496
00:29:09.734 --> 00:29:11.200
in the base of her
lower left lobe.

497
00:29:11.333 --> 00:29:12.500
Thought you heard?

498
00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:15.900
Andie. cardiologists
know they hear a crackle.

499
00:29:16.033 --> 00:29:18.867
Does she complain about
shortness of breath?

500
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.266
No.

501
00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.867
Weight gain. other
signs of fluid retention?

502
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:23.934
No.

503
00:29:24.066 --> 00:29:25.400
So no actual symptoms?

504
00:29:25.533 --> 00:29:27.867
Look. I understand your
confidence has been shaken.

505
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.400
but an avalanche of
unnecessary tests.

506
00:29:30.533 --> 00:29:32.266
that's medical student care.

507
00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.266
Look. you can't saddle your
patient with unwarranted anxiety

508
00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.800
because of your own.

509
00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:43.367
Have you seen someone.
gotten any counseling?

510
00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:46.600
I. I haven't had.
had time yet. no.

511
00:29:46.734 --> 00:29:48.433
Well. you should.

512
00:29:48.567 --> 00:29:50.867
There are a lot of
resources available to you.

513
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.200
take advantage of it.

514
00:29:53.734 --> 00:29:57.400
Take the rest of today and
tomorrow off. it'll do you good.

515
00:29:57.533 --> 00:29:59.100
I can't. I have a
full patient load.

516
00:29:59.233 --> 00:30:01.600
Your colleagues and I
will pick up the slack.

517
00:30:01.734 --> 00:30:04.100
I think the time away
will be good for you.

518
00:30:04.233 --> 00:30:05.467
Get your footing.

519
00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:13.734
Andie. we're cardiologists.

520
00:30:13.867 --> 00:30:16.066
cardiac disease is the
leading cause of death

521
00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.233
in this country.
dealing with mortality.

522
00:30:19.367 --> 00:30:21.700
it goes with the territory.

523
00:30:21.834 --> 00:30:22.867
I know that.

524
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.867
You've lost
patients before Henry

525
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.700
and you're going to lose more.

526
00:30:26.834 --> 00:30:29.567
I've had patients
die because of disease.

527
00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:32.533
but Henry's death was
premature and preventable.

528
00:30:32.667 --> 00:30:35.700
It's normal to
feel responsible when
we lose a patient.

529
00:30:35.834 --> 00:30:38.667
We get to know them so well.

530
00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:43.867
that we go through grief too.

531
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.400
but you need to learn
how to deal with that.

532
00:30:48.533 --> 00:30:49.433
You do.

533
00:30:59.567 --> 00:31:01.100
Go home.

534
00:31:01.233 --> 00:31:03.100
I'm gonna cancel both
of Selma's tests.

535
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.600
Huh?

536
00:31:19.734 --> 00:31:20.600
I was just-

537
00:31:20.734 --> 00:31:22.467
Trying to sneak out unnoticed?

538
00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.300
Apparently not very well.

539
00:31:24.433 --> 00:31:26.333
I tried calling
you multiple times.

540
00:31:26.467 --> 00:31:30.100
I know. I'm. um. I'm just not
very good company right now.

541
00:31:30.233 --> 00:31:32.333
Oh. well. lucky for
you. Maxwell and Company.

542
00:31:32.467 --> 00:31:34.633
I'll pull the weight
for the both of us.

543
00:31:34.767 --> 00:31:35.900
Another time?

544
00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:38.667
Sure.

545
00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.166
I'll. I'll. I'll
call you. I promise.

546
00:31:44.066 --> 00:31:48.500
I think it's a good idea. get
some space. clear your head.

547
00:31:48.633 --> 00:31:49.867
You don't think so?

548
00:31:51.233 --> 00:31:52.600
I don't know what I think.

549
00:31:52.734 --> 00:31:55.834
I'm going to Austin this
week. you should come.

550
00:31:55.967 --> 00:31:57.667
You want me to fly to Texas?

551
00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:00.166
We can spend the
afternoon eating barbecue

552
00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:01.934
and avoid getting a sunburn.

553
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.700
It feels like I'd be
running away from my problems.

554
00:32:07.834 --> 00:32:09.633
No. not running. flying.

555
00:32:11.633 --> 00:32:13.900
Think about it.

556
00:32:14.033 --> 00:32:16.500
Ready. Dad?

557
00:32:16.633 --> 00:32:19.734
I'm sorry. buddy. um.
can we play a little later?

558
00:32:19.867 --> 00:32:22.033
Come on. you promised.

559
00:32:22.166 --> 00:32:24.667
No. I-I. I don't
wanna interrupt. you
guys should go play.

560
00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:26.333
Will you play with us. Andie?

561
00:32:29.967 --> 00:32:34.066
Sure. as long as I can
be on your team. Will.

562
00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:37.233
- Of course. yeah. let's go.
- Hey.

563
00:32:37.367 --> 00:32:39.734
What? I gotta go
with the ace here.

564
00:32:39.867 --> 00:32:40.834
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

565
00:32:40.967 --> 00:32:42.000
Yeah.

566
00:32:42.133 --> 00:32:43.400
- Let's go. come on.
- Let's do this!

567
00:32:43.533 --> 00:32:44.400
Okay.

568
00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:49.900
Hey. what's going on
over there. you two?

569
00:32:50.033 --> 00:32:52.166
Nothing. nothing.

570
00:32:53.367 --> 00:32:54.834
Go. go. go.
go. go. go. go. go!

571
00:32:54.967 --> 00:32:55.934
Yeah!

572
00:32:57.533 --> 00:32:59.066
- Yeah!
- Yeah. high five!

573
00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.233
Whoo!

574
00:33:00.367 --> 00:33:01.266
Oh. really?

575
00:33:02.433 --> 00:33:04.567
You think that's funny?
- I do.

576
00:33:13.033 --> 00:33:17.433
If this is too much. we
can come back another day.

577
00:33:17.567 --> 00:33:21.233
I talked to Henny's friends.

578
00:33:21.367 --> 00:33:24.133
they're having a hard
time understanding

579
00:33:24.266 --> 00:33:26.567
how he was fine after
dinner and just...

580
00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:33.633
It's okay.

581
00:33:33.767 --> 00:33:36.767
I need to figure out what
kind of service to have for him.

582
00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:39.367
Well. what are you thinking?

583
00:33:40.433 --> 00:33:43.467
Oh.

584
00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.567
something intimate.

585
00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:51.400
something that'll help his
friends register the loss.

586
00:33:51.533 --> 00:33:53.333
That'd be beautiful.

587
00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:59.300
And I've been thinking
about something.

588
00:33:59.433 --> 00:34:03.200
wanted to mention it
when you were ready.

589
00:34:03.333 --> 00:34:06.300
What's this?

590
00:34:06.433 --> 00:34:09.300
It's an attorney. well.
you remember last winter.

591
00:34:09.433 --> 00:34:11.967
when my cousin. Cheryl was
hit by that drunk driver?

592
00:34:13.767 --> 00:34:18.633
He's not driving
anymore. Cheryl's
lawyer took care of that

593
00:34:18.767 --> 00:34:21.300
and now the roads are
a heck of a lot safer.

594
00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:29.033
I know that you can't make
sense of Henry's death.

595
00:34:29.166 --> 00:34:31.033
but you will feel better.

596
00:34:31.166 --> 00:34:33.700
if you stop it happening
to someone else.

597
00:34:33.834 --> 00:34:35.800
Hold that doctor accountable.

598
00:34:40.834 --> 00:34:42.000
Thanks for staying.

599
00:34:42.133 --> 00:34:43.967
I know it's probably
not what you wanna do.

600
00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:45.734
but I'm glad you did.

601
00:34:47.467 --> 00:34:50.533
You brought the
chocolate. right. Andie?

602
00:34:50.667 --> 00:34:52.367
Oh. did we
could get chocolate?

603
00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:54.200
- I don't know.
- Oh. I don't.

604
00:34:54.333 --> 00:34:56.200
oh. wait. is this what
you're talking about?

605
00:34:56.333 --> 00:34:58.367
Alright. let's go.

606
00:35:05.333 --> 00:35:09.266
It's no wonder why
I'd want this forever.

607
00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.934
Laundry's done. I'm
heading home soon.

608
00:35:12.066 --> 00:35:14.934
Oh. it's looks like this
little guy's tuckered out.

609
00:35:15.066 --> 00:35:16.300
I got him. don't worry.

610
00:35:19.066 --> 00:35:20.934
I'll get him tucked
in before I leave.

611
00:35:21.066 --> 00:35:23.266
Enjoy yourselves. goodnight.

612
00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.266
Goodnight.

613
00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.367
Goodnight.

614
00:35:29.734 --> 00:35:33.266
So my mother asked
if we set a date yet.

615
00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.233
You told your mom?

616
00:35:35.367 --> 00:35:36.367
Is that okay?

617
00:35:37.734 --> 00:35:39.100
Yeah. um. yes.

618
00:35:39.233 --> 00:35:41.100
She just said that some
venues need to be booked

619
00:35:41.233 --> 00:35:44.000
a year out and it would be
helpful to have a timeframe.

620
00:35:45.667 --> 00:35:49.567
Yeah. that. um.
that makes sense.

621
00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:55.367
Yeah. we don't. we don't
have to book anything just yet.

622
00:35:55.500 --> 00:36:00.433
Um. I'm just dealing
with a lot right now.

623
00:36:00.567 --> 00:36:03.000
Hey. look at me.

624
00:36:03.133 --> 00:36:07.467
We're gonna get through
this. okay. together.

625
00:36:18.233 --> 00:36:20.767
Come here.

626
00:36:31.266 --> 00:36:33.066
straightforward.ty

627
00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.934
The hospital won't fight
it and it will settle

628
00:36:37.066 --> 00:36:38.066
and it will be big.

629
00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:40.233
I'm not interested in money.

630
00:36:40.367 --> 00:36:43.734
I wanna make sure this never
happens to anyone else.

631
00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:48.700
The only way the medical
world is motivated to fix things

632
00:36:48.834 --> 00:36:49.734
is to pay dollars.

633
00:36:49.867 --> 00:36:51.567
Well. that's not good enough.

634
00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:53.567
I want Dr. Hodge's
license suspended.

635
00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:56.233
She'll most likely go
before a review board.

636
00:36:56.367 --> 00:37:00.867
but that's not a common
outcome with a case like this.

637
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.700
My son is not some case.

638
00:37:03.834 --> 00:37:07.200
he was a person
and her negligence

639
00:37:07.333 --> 00:37:12.233
took away the most important.
valuable thing in my world.

640
00:37:13.433 --> 00:37:14.800
I can't let her do
this to someone else

641
00:37:14.934 --> 00:37:16.834
and she shouldn't be a doctor

642
00:37:16.967 --> 00:37:20.767
and if you can't help me. I
will find someone who can.

643
00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:31.033
So we get to the
end of the dinner

644
00:37:31.166 --> 00:37:36.133
and I offer to split the check
and he gives me this look.

645
00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:38.367
Because he wanted
to pay for it?

646
00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:40.867
He wanted me to.

647
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.133
You don't know
how lucky you are.

648
00:37:43.266 --> 00:37:45.467
You definitely found
one of the good ones.

649
00:37:46.834 --> 00:37:48.467
Hm. do you wanna carpool

650
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.967
to Phil Baker's retirement
party next week?

651
00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:53.467
I totally forgot that
was coming up. Thanks.

652
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.667
I think I want dessert.

653
00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.166
creme brulee?

654
00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:01.934
Shouldn't we grab the check.
aren't you on shift soon?

655
00:38:02.066 --> 00:38:04.200
I'm off. I had
some vacation time

656
00:38:04.333 --> 00:38:07.533
and if I don't cash it in.
it just goes to waste. so.

657
00:38:07.667 --> 00:38:09.900
I know what you're doing.

658
00:38:10.033 --> 00:38:12.867
You don't have to worry
about me. I'm fine.

659
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.467
Oh. okay. so then why
haven't you told me about this?

660
00:38:19.734 --> 00:38:23.867
Ah. it just hasn't
felt like the right time.

661
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.600
We've been sitting at this
table for almost 40 minutes.

662
00:38:26.734 --> 00:38:29.700
you've let me drone on and
on about my dating woes.

663
00:38:29.834 --> 00:38:30.800
Look. it...

664
00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:34.233
It's complicated.

665
00:38:34.367 --> 00:38:39.200
I love Patrick and
he makes me so happy.

666
00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.734
but every time I
look at the ring.

667
00:38:42.867 --> 00:38:45.600
I just keep
remembering that night.

668
00:38:45.734 --> 00:38:48.400
just wanting one thing
to have been different.

669
00:38:48.533 --> 00:38:51.200
It's not the same. Andie.

670
00:38:51.333 --> 00:38:53.066
What happened with your mother-

671
00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:54.333
This isn't about her.

672
00:38:57.066 --> 00:38:58.367
Okay.

673
00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:15.767
It's open.

674
00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:20.767
Hi. you. um. you
heading out soon?

675
00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:22.934
Yep. just wanted
to say goodbye

676
00:39:24.433 --> 00:39:27.934
and see if I could change
your mind about Austin.

677
00:39:28.066 --> 00:39:31.500
Thank you again. but
it's gonna have to be a no.

678
00:39:31.633 --> 00:39:32.600
Okay.

679
00:39:39.934 --> 00:39:42.934
You look just like your mom.

680
00:39:43.066 --> 00:39:44.800
you have her smile.

681
00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:49.667
Just been thinking
about her a lot lately.

682
00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:50.900
Any reason?

683
00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:56.133
Um...

684
00:39:56.266 --> 00:40:01.834
You know she died when I
was 10. she had been sick

685
00:40:01.967 --> 00:40:05.000
and that day I. ah.

686
00:40:05.133 --> 00:40:09.166
I went to the movies
with my friends

687
00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:15.667
and by the time I got
dropped back off at home.

688
00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:20.767
she was a lot worse and
I didn't know what to do.

689
00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:27.433
So I just laid down on
the couch next to her.

690
00:40:27.567 --> 00:40:30.367
just hoping she
would get better.

691
00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:36.834
Eventually a neighbor came over
and called for an ambulance.

692
00:40:36.967 --> 00:40:38.400
but by then it was too late.

693
00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:44.000
Andie.
you were just a kid.

694
00:40:44.133 --> 00:40:50.100
I know. but that's the
reason I became a doctor.

695
00:40:50.233 --> 00:40:54.767
just because I don't wanna
ever feel like that again.

696
00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:59.600
Helpless.

697
00:40:59.734 --> 00:41:02.166
Do you want me
to call in sick?

698
00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:03.700
I can stay.

699
00:41:03.834 --> 00:41:06.333
No. no. no. I'm. I'm fine.

700
00:41:06.467 --> 00:41:08.166
Are you sure?

701
00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:09.266
Promise.

702
00:41:11.033 --> 00:41:12.233
Okay.

703
00:41:12.367 --> 00:41:15.667
Oh.
I almost forgot.

704
00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:17.200
I was afraid that I
wasn't gonna be able

705
00:41:17.333 --> 00:41:21.500
to convince you to come. so
I went and picked up these.

706
00:41:21.633 --> 00:41:24.000
I thought you and Willie
could go to the game tonight.

707
00:41:24.133 --> 00:41:25.767
it might be a nice distraction.

708
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.266
He asked for you.

709
00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:39.867
You want my advice?

710
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.166
Well. that depends
on what it is.

711
00:41:44.533 --> 00:41:46.433
Go to the game
and have some fun

712
00:41:47.633 --> 00:41:49.834
and try the caramel
corn. it's crazy good.

713
00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:54.367
Have a safe flight.

714
00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:57.900
Miss you already!

715
00:41:59.533 --> 00:42:01.633
Henry's mother has
already filed a claim

716
00:42:01.767 --> 00:42:04.133
for wrongful death. someone's
usually in their ear.

717
00:42:04.266 --> 00:42:06.133
when they're moving this fast.

718
00:42:06.266 --> 00:42:09.300
My job is to decide whether
to deny her demand outright.

719
00:42:09.433 --> 00:42:11.734
settle it. or take it to trial.

720
00:42:11.867 --> 00:42:15.066
Now. an error doesn't mean
that you were negligent

721
00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.467
and even if you were.

722
00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.967
it doesn't mean your
negligence caused any damages.

723
00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:21.233
Caused any damages?

724
00:42:21.367 --> 00:42:22.467
He-he's dead.

725
00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:24.300
Well. what we
have to determine

726
00:42:24.433 --> 00:42:26.133
is whether you were negligent

727
00:42:26.266 --> 00:42:27.967
in not telling him not to drive.

728
00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:30.066
A medical expert needs
to weigh in on this.

729
00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:32.233
As a licensed cardiologist.

730
00:42:32.367 --> 00:42:34.734
I can state definitively
that it did.

731
00:42:36.867 --> 00:42:40.066
You know. Dr.
Hodges. I usually get

732
00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:43.400
these kinds of comments from
the plaintiff's attorney.

733
00:42:43.533 --> 00:42:46.567
Now it's gonna be harder for
me to render a defense for you.

734
00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:48.867
if you're not willing to-
- I don't want it defended.

735
00:42:50.266 --> 00:42:55.467
Okay. let's.
let's put a pin in that.

736
00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:56.567
If the mother
should contact you-

737
00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:57.667
We already spoke.

738
00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:00.367
Where did she find you?

739
00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:01.967
At her front door?

740
00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:03.533
What did you say?

741
00:43:03.667 --> 00:43:05.867
- I wanted to apologize.
- Did you?

742
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.700
She barely let
me get a word in.

743
00:43:07.834 --> 00:43:10.700
Alright. look. you can't
have any future contact

744
00:43:10.834 --> 00:43:13.800
with his mother.

745
00:43:14.834 --> 00:43:15.967
Alright. I'm gonna do my best

746
00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:17.800
to settle this without a trial.

747
00:43:21.266 --> 00:43:23.467
There's a downside to
this though. you know.

748
00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.200
I can think of
about 100 downsides.

749
00:43:25.333 --> 00:43:27.700
No. I meant specific
to settling it.

750
00:43:27.834 --> 00:43:29.467
If she gets any money at all.

751
00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:32.300
it'll be reported to the
National Practitioner Data Bank.

752
00:43:32.433 --> 00:43:34.700
potential patients can
find out about that.

753
00:43:34.834 --> 00:43:35.967
They should.

754
00:43:37.166 --> 00:43:38.867
They're choosing
someone they trust

755
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.633
to help make their
medical decisions.

756
00:43:40.767 --> 00:43:43.133
They should have access
to all the facts.

757
00:43:43.266 --> 00:43:46.800
Dr. Hodges. that
kind of report.

758
00:43:46.934 --> 00:43:49.867
it's gonna follow you for as
long as you practice medicine.

759
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.467
It's gonna follow me
for as long as I live.

760
00:44:10.033 --> 00:44:11.500
- Hey.
- Hey.

761
00:44:11.633 --> 00:44:13.700
You're just in time. Andie.
we're having an early dinner.

762
00:44:13.834 --> 00:44:15.600
do you care to join us?

763
00:44:15.734 --> 00:44:18.700
Thank you. Laura. but
I'm not very hungry.

764
00:44:18.834 --> 00:44:21.100
Even for my famous
coconut-crusted haddock

765
00:44:21.233 --> 00:44:23.200
with pomegranate salsa?

766
00:44:23.333 --> 00:44:26.266
I'm gonna have to
take a rain check.

767
00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:27.767
He's out back.

768
00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:28.867
Thank you.

769
00:44:31.066 --> 00:44:33.934
So I am being sued
for wrongful death.

770
00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:42.367
That's not uncommon
after adverse events.

771
00:44:44.834 --> 00:44:48.266
I met with the insurance
guy and he wants to settle.

772
00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:49.600
If the adjuster
can resolve it.

773
00:44:49.734 --> 00:44:51.600
it's less expensive for
the insurance company.

774
00:44:51.734 --> 00:44:54.266
He said I could benefit
from disclosure training.

775
00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:57.867
It teaches us how to show
empathy without admitting fault.

776
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.433
I've gotten through college.
med school. residency.

777
00:45:01.567 --> 00:45:05.333
but now I need to be taught
how to apologize correctly?

778
00:45:05.467 --> 00:45:09.734
We live in a litigious
society. you know that.

779
00:45:10.767 --> 00:45:14.734
Hand me that rag.

780
00:45:18.767 --> 00:45:20.500
It's beautiful.

781
00:45:20.633 --> 00:45:23.133
I've always loved lighthouses.

782
00:45:23.266 --> 00:45:26.266
they guide ships in uncertain
waters back to shore.

783
00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:31.166
I've got more bad news.

784
00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:36.767
the Larkin case is going
before a peer review.

785
00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:43.266
That was on my list of goals
to be part of that committee.

786
00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:47.934
but defending myself wasn't
exactly what I had in mind.

787
00:45:48.066 --> 00:45:49.166
Specifically. you
said peer review

788
00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:50.800
was a way to continue
learning in medicine.

789
00:45:50.934 --> 00:45:54.567
Did you mean only when other
doctors have problematic cases?

790
00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:03.066
You've always consulted me for
the tough cardiac questions.

791
00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:07.233
makes me think you
value my opinion.

792
00:46:07.367 --> 00:46:08.500
Of course I do.

793
00:46:08.633 --> 00:46:10.734
When I tell you
you're a great doctor.

794
00:46:10.867 --> 00:46:14.967
in spite of an extremely
unfortunate event.

795
00:46:16.367 --> 00:46:20.533
it appears you don't have
the least bit of faith in me.

796
00:46:23.467 --> 00:46:25.500
Come on inside.

797
00:46:25.633 --> 00:46:27.266
We're having fish.

798
00:46:29.133 --> 00:46:30.500
I would love to.

799
00:46:30.633 --> 00:46:34.233
but I actually have a date
with a seven-year old.

800
00:46:34.367 --> 00:46:37.233
Oh. I see.

801
00:46:37.367 --> 00:46:39.433
Well. that clearly
takes precedence.

802
00:46:43.834 --> 00:46:46.166
Wow. I bet that puck
almost broke the glass.

803
00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:47.734
He almost got the hat trick.

804
00:46:47.867 --> 00:46:49.533
Is he your favorite player?

805
00:46:49.667 --> 00:46:53.066
He's the best. my dad said
he skates like a water bug.

806
00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:56.667
I think he's gonna make the
All Star team this year.

807
00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:58.433
We'll see. come on. let's go.

808
00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:01.934
How about you use the
restroom. before we head home?

809
00:47:02.066 --> 00:47:03.066
Okay.

810
00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:04.400
I'll take your stuff.

811
00:47:04.533 --> 00:47:06.233
I'll be right out
here waiting for you.

812
00:47:06.367 --> 00:47:07.667
Okay.

813
00:47:19.867 --> 00:47:22.100
A pole. a power
outage. a fatality.

814
00:47:22.233 --> 00:47:25.467
sounds like an accident. but
as details continue to emerge.

815
00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:27.133
it may be anything but.

816
00:47:27.266 --> 00:47:29.734
"On the
Hook" with Brenda Lopez.

817
00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:33.600
The recent power outage
involved one square mile

818
00:47:33.734 --> 00:47:35.266
and over 5.000 residents.

819
00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:39.233
However. the most devastating
loss was not of electricity.

820
00:47:39.367 --> 00:47:42.400
but of a life and "On the
Hook" is learning today.

821
00:47:42.533 --> 00:47:44.767
that it may have
been preventable.

822
00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:47.567
Mrs. Larkin. you called
the cause of this tragedy

823
00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:50.734
medical negligence and
an inexcusable violation

824
00:47:50.867 --> 00:47:53.467
of the needs of
the disabled. why?

825
00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:56.066
My son wasn't feeling well

826
00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:57.800
and he shouldn't
have been driving.

827
00:47:57.934 --> 00:48:02.633
but his doctor didn't
tell him not to.

828
00:48:02.767 --> 00:48:04.200
Why not?

829
00:48:04.333 --> 00:48:06.467
Because of who he was.

830
00:48:07.633 --> 00:48:10.467
So Dr. Andrea
Hodges just assumed.

831
00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.834
that because of his
intellectual disability.

832
00:48:12.967 --> 00:48:14.467
he couldn't drive?

833
00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:17.734
I don't think she took
the time to ask him.

834
00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:21.834
That seems so basic.

835
00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:26.967
Hey. Andie.

836
00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:29.467
Hey. where.
where did you find this?

837
00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:32.700
The internet. I don't
know how many people saw it.

838
00:48:32.834 --> 00:48:33.867
It's airing at 11.

839
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.033
I mean. she called
me up by name.

840
00:48:36.166 --> 00:48:37.467
Who airs a grievance.

841
00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:40.333
no matter how much pain
they're in on a news segment?

842
00:48:40.467 --> 00:48:41.967
Clearly somebody
who doesn't feel

843
00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:43.200
like they're being listened to.

844
00:48:43.333 --> 00:48:44.633
Or someone
who's being encouraged

845
00:48:44.767 --> 00:48:46.166
to handle it this way.

846
00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:48.633
Either way.
it. it doesn't matter.

847
00:48:48.767 --> 00:48:50.300
What are you gonna do?

848
00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:54.467
I don't know.

849
00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:57.700
Ah. let me call you back.

850
00:48:57.834 --> 00:48:58.800
Will?

851
00:48:59.834 --> 00:49:01.867
Will!

852
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.066
Will!

853
00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:07.900
Will!

854
00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:15.934
Will!

855
00:49:16.066 --> 00:49:19.033
Will!

856
00:49:19.166 --> 00:49:23.233
Will. sorry. Will!

857
00:49:23.367 --> 00:49:25.033
Hi. um. can you make an
overhead announcement?

858
00:49:25.166 --> 00:49:27.400
I-I lost a child. he's
about this tall and um-

859
00:49:27.533 --> 00:49:28.867
- Andie!
- Will!

860
00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:33.200
Are you okay?

861
00:49:34.467 --> 00:49:38.233
I should have never
taken my eyes off you.

862
00:49:38.367 --> 00:49:39.533
Where'd you go?

863
00:49:40.667 --> 00:49:44.266
I got a puck.

864
00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:45.567
I'm so sorry.

865
00:49:49.166 --> 00:49:51.033
- It was scary.
- Hm.

866
00:49:51.166 --> 00:49:55.767
I mean. not scary like
danger or monsters or bad guys.

867
00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:57.700
Mm-hm.

868
00:49:57.834 --> 00:49:59.433
I mean. scary like fun.

869
00:49:59.567 --> 00:50:02.400
Hm. well. it's a
good lesson. Will

870
00:50:02.533 --> 00:50:04.934
for museums or amusement parks.

871
00:50:05.066 --> 00:50:07.867
If you ever get separated.
we have a plan now.

872
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.533
meet at lost and found.

873
00:50:12.033 --> 00:50:14.700
Seems like you two
found a great plan.

874
00:50:14.834 --> 00:50:17.033
even if you didn't
do it on purpose.

875
00:50:19.066 --> 00:50:21.367
Will. if I didn't
mention it before.

876
00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:25.600
I'm really proud of you. you
were smart and. and brave

877
00:50:25.734 --> 00:50:27.367
and you did just
the right thing.

878
00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:28.467
Thanks. Andie.

879
00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:35.033
I need to get some air.
I'm just gonna go for a walk.

880
00:50:35.166 --> 00:50:37.033
Okay.

881
00:50:56.734 --> 00:50:58.867
Andie. what are you doing?

882
00:51:00.467 --> 00:51:03.266
I. um. I just. I wanted
to wait until you got home

883
00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:04.934
and then I could explain.

884
00:51:05.066 --> 00:51:08.767
Hey. I already told you. it
could've happened to anybody.

885
00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:10.433
Yeah. yeah. it could've
happened to anyone.

886
00:51:10.567 --> 00:51:12.166
but it happened to me.
it happened on my watch

887
00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:13.500
and if something terrible
would've happened-

888
00:51:13.633 --> 00:51:14.600
But it didn't.

889
00:51:16.233 --> 00:51:18.600
It's okay.

890
00:51:18.734 --> 00:51:21.000
You're okay.

891
00:51:21.133 --> 00:51:22.834
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

892
00:51:22.967 --> 00:51:24.333
Come here.

893
00:51:28.266 --> 00:51:29.233
I love you.

894
00:51:33.967 --> 00:51:36.000
This changes everything.

895
00:51:36.133 --> 00:51:39.600
Hospital received hundreds
of calls after the broadcast.

896
00:51:39.734 --> 00:51:41.100
it's a sign of the times.

897
00:51:41.233 --> 00:51:44.166
The other partners
can't ignore this.

898
00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:46.600
We've already discussed it.

899
00:51:46.734 --> 00:51:48.934
And what was the consensus?

900
00:51:49.066 --> 00:51:51.133
That your clinical
skills are flawless

901
00:51:51.266 --> 00:51:52.934
and that none of us
would've asked you

902
00:51:53.066 --> 00:51:54.600
to join the practice.
if they weren't.

903
00:51:54.734 --> 00:51:57.767
And despite what some
tabloid insinuates.

904
00:51:58.967 --> 00:52:00.233
your patients have a
true connection to you.

905
00:52:00.367 --> 00:52:02.734
That could be said
about most doctors.

906
00:52:02.867 --> 00:52:07.834
No. most doctors aspire
to be excellent clinicians.

907
00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:10.900
they settle for just enough
of the humanity to get by.

908
00:52:11.033 --> 00:52:13.867
That means they can go a
little easier on themselves.

909
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.533
if there's an oversight.

910
00:52:15.667 --> 00:52:18.333
Every one of us has been
through some form of this.

911
00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:22.400
it's part of being a
physician. you deal with it.

912
00:52:22.533 --> 00:52:24.834
This isn't the place for it.

913
00:52:24.967 --> 00:52:26.100
Maybe it isn't.

914
00:52:27.667 --> 00:52:29.533
Don't let the very thing
that makes you a great doctor

915
00:52:29.667 --> 00:52:32.233
be your downfall in medicine.

916
00:52:32.367 --> 00:52:35.433
It's going to be a very
rough ride from here on out.

917
00:52:36.867 --> 00:52:41.734
I need you to prepare
yourself for that.

918
00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:50.166
Henry was an eagle of sorts.

919
00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:53.867
courageous in his
pursuit of independence.

920
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.333
powerful in the
mastery of his skills.

921
00:52:56.467 --> 00:52:58.734
which didn't come easily.

922
00:52:58.867 --> 00:53:01.734
But he was blessed.
because he had a mother.

923
00:53:02.934 --> 00:53:04.900
who gave him the
greatest of gifts.

924
00:53:05.033 --> 00:53:08.133
the freedom to live
a life on his own.

925
00:53:08.266 --> 00:53:11.266
even when she knew
he'd be leaving

926
00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:13.667
the protection and
certainty of her home.

927
00:53:15.266 --> 00:53:20.066
Now. the eagle is a brave and
elegant bird in its flight

928
00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:22.967
and Henry has taken
flight now too.

929
00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:25.700
soaring gracefully
among the angels.

930
00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:33.133
Our heart tells us not to
let him go. it's difficult.

931
00:53:33.266 --> 00:53:36.800
but it's not up us to hold
him back from that beauty.

932
00:54:07.467 --> 00:54:09.367
Hello?

933
00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:11.633
Hey. um. can we talk?

934
00:54:15.333 --> 00:54:19.133
Glad you called. I
was getting worried.

935
00:54:19.266 --> 00:54:23.200
So what do you wanna talk about?

936
00:54:23.333 --> 00:54:24.734
Andie. it's okay.

937
00:54:27.133 --> 00:54:29.667
I-I don't think I can do this.

938
00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:31.633
What do you mean this?

939
00:54:33.266 --> 00:54:34.967
Us. I thought I
could handle it.

940
00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:38.166
Whoa. whoa. slow down.
where's this coming from?

941
00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:40.834
Things are just
really messy right now

942
00:54:40.967 --> 00:54:43.166
and they're about to
get a whole lot worse.

943
00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:44.633
Andie. we're a team.

944
00:54:44.767 --> 00:54:47.133
There are going to be
times when life gets hard.

945
00:54:47.266 --> 00:54:49.834
the whole point is it'll be
easier to get through together.

946
00:54:49.967 --> 00:54:51.834
This isn't just a bump
in the road. Patrick.

947
00:54:51.967 --> 00:54:54.467
I am talking lawsuits.
a public smear campaign.

948
00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:58.633
everything that I've worked
for just disappearing

949
00:54:58.767 --> 00:55:02.633
and. and I can't bring that
into your life or Will's.

950
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.033
Don't we get a say in that?

951
00:55:06.166 --> 00:55:09.867
The newscast is just the
beginning and I don't know

952
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.767
where things are gonna go
over the next few months.

953
00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:17.033
but we always agreed that
Will needs to come first

954
00:55:17.166 --> 00:55:21.200
and if this brought any
harm to him or you. I...

955
00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:26.734
I don't know if I
could live with that.

956
00:55:26.867 --> 00:55:30.066
I'm not willing to
take that chance.

957
00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:33.900
Andie. I am not looking
for perfection in a partner

958
00:55:34.033 --> 00:55:37.600
and I hope that's not what
you're looking for in me.

959
00:55:37.734 --> 00:55:38.934
I wanna help you
get through this.

960
00:55:39.066 --> 00:55:40.800
you don't have to do this alone.

961
00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:47.700
Yes. I do.

962
00:55:48.734 --> 00:55:50.533
Please.

963
00:55:50.667 --> 00:55:52.934
So sorry.

964
00:56:18.967 --> 00:56:21.333
Okay. gear's in
the car. you ready?

965
00:56:21.467 --> 00:56:25.333
Hey. hey. hey.
slow down. slow down.

966
00:56:25.467 --> 00:56:27.700
Are we picking
Andie up on the way?

967
00:56:30.066 --> 00:56:31.834
Ah. not today. buddy.

968
00:56:31.967 --> 00:56:33.600
Oh. really?

969
00:56:33.734 --> 00:56:35.500
Where are your cleats?

970
00:56:35.633 --> 00:56:38.266
Oh. in your bedroom on
the floor in the closet.

971
00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:40.667
Oh. I made a sandwich for you.

972
00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:42.767
if you're hungry. I
can wrap it up for you.

973
00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:44.367
Thanks. I'm fine.

974
00:56:46.133 --> 00:56:49.433
So I know we scheduled
a day off on Tuesday.

975
00:56:49.567 --> 00:56:51.166
but Andie was supposed
to take him and-

976
00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:52.967
It's no trouble.

977
00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:55.934
I'm sure she's quite
busy at the hospital.

978
00:56:56.066 --> 00:56:58.934
Andie and I aren't gonna
be seeing each other anymore.

979
00:56:59.967 --> 00:57:03.333
I'm sorry.

980
00:57:03.467 --> 00:57:05.567
I know it comes as
a bit of a surprise.

981
00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:08.900
but we both thought that
this would be for the best.

982
00:57:09.033 --> 00:57:11.166
Oh. I saw the news
report on the television.

983
00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:15.400
I can't imagine how painful
it must have been for Andie.

984
00:57:15.533 --> 00:57:17.667
I'm sure that
mother is suffering.

985
00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:21.066
but she's taking it out
on the wrong person.

986
00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:22.367
Hey. Dad.

987
00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:23.567
Hey.

988
00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:25.333
Since Andie can't
come to the game.

989
00:57:25.467 --> 00:57:27.000
can we record it for her?

990
00:57:27.133 --> 00:57:29.266
She told me she
hates to miss them.

991
00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:34.400
- Sure.
- Awesome!

992
00:57:34.533 --> 00:57:35.834
- Okay. you ready?
- Yeah.

993
00:57:35.967 --> 00:57:37.834
Okay. come on.
let's go. big game.

994
00:57:37.967 --> 00:57:38.934
Bye. guys.

995
00:57:55.633 --> 00:57:57.166
Hello?

996
00:57:57.300 --> 00:58:00.100
Hey. you left me a
ticket for Atlanta.

997
00:58:00.233 --> 00:58:02.300
I need a favor.

998
00:58:02.433 --> 00:58:04.433
Atlanta. why would
I go to Atlanta?

999
00:58:04.567 --> 00:58:05.633
You're not.

1000
00:58:05.767 --> 00:58:07.033
Well. this
ticket says I am.

1001
00:58:08.433 --> 00:58:10.066
I wanna show you something.

1002
00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:12.300
It's the only way that I
can get you through security

1003
00:58:12.433 --> 00:58:15.133
into the gate. can
you do that for me?

1004
00:58:15.266 --> 00:58:16.133
Okay.

1005
00:58:16.266 --> 00:58:18.133
I'll see you then.

1006
00:58:29.767 --> 00:58:32.734
Hey. what is this all about?

1007
00:58:32.867 --> 00:58:33.900
You'll see.

1008
00:58:44.867 --> 00:58:47.166
Follow me. watch what happens.

1009
00:59:10.767 --> 00:59:13.834
Excuse me. is
everything okay. Captain?

1010
00:59:13.967 --> 00:59:15.800
Is it going to be
a rough flight?

1011
00:59:15.934 --> 00:59:17.967
Everything's fine. we
expect it to be smooth

1012
00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:20.033
and we'll let you
know if that changes

1013
00:59:20.166 --> 00:59:22.367
and you be sure to let us know
if there's anything we can do

1014
00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:24.333
to make you more comfortable.

1015
00:59:24.467 --> 00:59:25.433
Thank you.

1016
00:59:33.834 --> 00:59:35.133
I don't understand.

1017
00:59:35.266 --> 00:59:38.533
I wanted you to see
them. they trust me.

1018
00:59:38.667 --> 00:59:41.667
but do you know why some
of them still look nervous.

1019
00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:44.200
wanna look me right in my eyes?

1020
00:59:44.333 --> 00:59:45.200
Why?

1021
00:59:45.333 --> 00:59:47.133
Because they know I'm human.

1022
00:59:47.266 --> 00:59:51.033
They know the mechanic's
human. the fuel guy's human.

1023
00:59:51.166 --> 00:59:52.967
they trust us to do our job.

1024
00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:55.200
But in spite of every
effort to the contrary.

1025
00:59:55.333 --> 00:59:57.633
something could still go
wrong. they know that.

1026
00:59:58.934 --> 01:00:00.300
I'm not sure of your point.

1027
01:00:00.433 --> 01:00:03.800
Would you stay with me.
if something went wrong?

1028
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.367
If I did exactly what you did.

1029
01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:09.333
would you push me away or
would you stick by my side?

1030
01:00:09.467 --> 01:00:10.800
It's not the same.

1031
01:00:10.934 --> 01:00:13.734
Should I blame Will's
mom's doctors for her death?

1032
01:00:14.834 --> 01:00:16.200
Patrick.

1033
01:00:16.333 --> 01:00:17.967
Couldn't something have
been done to save her?

1034
01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:19.633
I-I don't know the specifics.

1035
01:00:19.767 --> 01:00:22.033
I-I'm not her doctor.
I can't answer that.

1036
01:00:22.166 --> 01:00:23.300
Try.

1037
01:00:23.433 --> 01:00:24.700
Medicine isn't
a perfect science.

1038
01:00:24.834 --> 01:00:27.467
So medicine isn't perfect.
but a doctor should be?

1039
01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:29.300
It's not always
about the medicine.

1040
01:00:29.433 --> 01:00:31.700
it's about what we should
have done and didn't do.

1041
01:00:31.834 --> 01:00:34.367
I wish you would
just let me help you.

1042
01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:36.300
I know you're hurting.

1043
01:00:36.433 --> 01:00:37.300
It's not about me.

1044
01:00:37.433 --> 01:00:39.734
You should have seen his mother.

1045
01:00:42.433 --> 01:00:45.367
the look on her face.

1046
01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:49.300
I caused that pain. Patrick.
there's no reconciling that.

1047
01:00:49.433 --> 01:00:51.633
I appreciate what you're
trying to do for me.

1048
01:00:52.934 --> 01:00:55.367
but I need to be on
my own for a while.

1049
01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:00.867
I don't know
how to let you go.

1050
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.667
That's why I did it for you.

1051
01:01:04.166 --> 01:01:08.967
Captain.

1052
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.533
You should go on.

1053
01:01:27.567 --> 01:01:31.300
n fal)

1054
01:02:14.033 --> 01:02:15.033
Coming.

1055
01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:20.433
Hey.

1056
01:02:20.567 --> 01:02:21.433
You okay?

1057
01:02:21.567 --> 01:02:23.100
Can we talk?

1058
01:02:23.233 --> 01:02:24.700
Yeah. come in.

1059
01:02:28.967 --> 01:02:33.667
I need you to be honest
with me. it's about a case.

1060
01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:35.266
I don't know.

1061
01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:38.433
Andie. I can only ask a
cardiologist who I trust.

1062
01:02:41.767 --> 01:02:44.834
Okay. tell me
about the patient.

1063
01:02:44.967 --> 01:02:50.600
My patient yesterday. a
really sick guy. very unstable.

1064
01:02:50.734 --> 01:02:53.000
Dr. Sandler wanted to
check his potassium.

1065
01:02:53.133 --> 01:02:55.834
told me to get his
blood drawn at 11.

1066
01:02:55.967 --> 01:03:00.166
at 11:15. he went into
full cardiac arrest.

1067
01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:05.066
He didn't make it.

1068
01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:07.133
What was his potassium level?

1069
01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:11.667
I don't know. because
it was never drawn.

1070
01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:15.734
I didn't realize it
until after he coded.

1071
01:03:15.867 --> 01:03:21.333
- The lab never drew it?
- No.

1072
01:03:21.467 --> 01:03:23.333
15 minutes is within
the accepted window.

1073
01:03:23.467 --> 01:03:26.900
He should have caught it.
you know. it wasn't a stat lab.

1074
01:03:27.033 --> 01:03:28.533
but I knew how important it was.

1075
01:03:28.667 --> 01:03:30.567
Well. look. that's because you

1076
01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:33.100
are the most conscientious
nurse I know.

1077
01:03:34.867 --> 01:03:37.867
Look. you wanted my
honest medical opinion.

1078
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.400
well. here it is. if
the blood had been drawn

1079
01:03:41.533 --> 01:03:44.000
and if the lab had run
it at lightning speed

1080
01:03:44.133 --> 01:03:46.033
and if the results had
come back abnormal.

1081
01:03:46.166 --> 01:03:48.867
and if Dr. Sandler had
picked up right away

1082
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.500
and if you were able to treat it

1083
01:03:50.633 --> 01:03:51.734
all within those 15 minutes.

1084
01:03:51.867 --> 01:03:53.934
would the patient
still be alive?

1085
01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:58.667
Highly unlikely.

1086
01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:01.300
And what were you doing
during those 15 minutes.

1087
01:04:01.433 --> 01:04:04.800
were you in the nurse's
lounge snacking on popcorn?

1088
01:04:04.934 --> 01:04:07.533
No.

1089
01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:12.266
I was titrating dopamine
on another patient

1090
01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:15.333
trying to salvage what's
left of his kidney function.

1091
01:04:17.066 --> 01:04:19.800
We're only given a few
minutes with each patient

1092
01:04:19.934 --> 01:04:23.133
and when we start allocating
more time than that.

1093
01:04:23.266 --> 01:04:25.233
we're taking it away
from another patient.

1094
01:04:25.367 --> 01:04:27.433
Could you have
caught the problem?

1095
01:04:27.567 --> 01:04:32.533
Maybe in a perfect world.
that's not the world we work in.

1096
01:04:33.934 --> 01:04:35.266
A lot of other nurses
wouldn't have even given it

1097
01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.133
a second thought if they
could have done any better.

1098
01:04:37.266 --> 01:04:38.967
given the circumstances.

1099
01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:43.667
Thank you.

1100
01:04:47.867 --> 01:04:52.967
Why are you so much easier on
me than you are on yourself?

1101
01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:57.734
Andie. I miss you. we all do.

1102
01:04:57.867 --> 01:05:00.133
I miss you too.

1103
01:05:00.266 --> 01:05:03.300
I. um...

1104
01:05:03.433 --> 01:05:06.133
I just don't think
being back at work

1105
01:05:06.266 --> 01:05:08.133
is what I need right now.

1106
01:05:08.266 --> 01:05:09.800
What do you need?

1107
01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:21.800
Hey. bud. I wanna talk to
you about something. okay.

1108
01:05:30.266 --> 01:05:36.000
Andie and I. we've
decided to take a break.

1109
01:05:36.133 --> 01:05:38.467
not see each other for a bit.

1110
01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:39.967
Is it 'cause I got lost?

1111
01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:44.367
No. no. of course not.
Willie. it's nothing you did.

1112
01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:45.633
She loves you.

1113
01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:48.967
Andie's just going through
a hard time right now

1114
01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:50.834
and she needs some
space to deal with it.

1115
01:05:50.967 --> 01:05:53.066
Will she still
come watch my games?

1116
01:05:54.467 --> 01:05:57.834
When she can. I'm sure.

1117
01:05:57.967 --> 01:06:00.600
Andie's still gonna be
a part of your life.

1118
01:06:00.734 --> 01:06:03.200
it's just gonna be
a little different.

1119
01:06:03.333 --> 01:06:05.633
But I don't want
it to be different.

1120
01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:14.000
Who's going to cheer for
me loud like she does?

1121
01:06:24.667 --> 01:06:28.400
It's okay.

1122
01:06:47.667 --> 01:06:50.600
"If the room feels
like it's a spin.

1123
01:06:50.734 --> 01:06:53.367
when you get off the
teacups at Disneyland

1124
01:06:54.834 --> 01:06:58.734
or if it feels like the
shades are being pulled down.

1125
01:06:58.867 --> 01:07:02.433
call me. here's my cell number.

1126
01:07:03.633 --> 01:07:07.166
Call me even if you
have no real reason.

1127
01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:09.934
but you feel like you want to."

1128
01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:32.133
I'm not supposed
to speak to you.

1129
01:07:32.266 --> 01:07:34.166
I know. it's not
good for the case.

1130
01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:37.433
I was told the same thing
by more than one attorney.

1131
01:07:37.567 --> 01:07:41.033
I just need 30 seconds of your
time and then I-I will leave.

1132
01:07:42.967 --> 01:07:46.433
You said that I should have
known that Henry drove.

1133
01:07:46.567 --> 01:07:48.834
you're right. if I had.

1134
01:07:48.967 --> 01:07:51.266
I would've given him
different instructions.

1135
01:07:52.433 --> 01:07:55.600
I assumed that he didn't
just like you said.

1136
01:07:55.734 --> 01:07:59.300
During this negotiation. someone
may say that it was okay.

1137
01:07:59.433 --> 01:08:02.033
that I never asked
him if he drove.

1138
01:08:02.166 --> 01:08:04.400
I don't think that's true.

1139
01:08:04.533 --> 01:08:06.867
I should have known
that about him.

1140
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.233
that's the standard of
care I expect of myself

1141
01:08:10.367 --> 01:08:12.900
and that's what Henry
trusted me to do.

1142
01:08:13.033 --> 01:08:14.734
Not just to be nice to him.

1143
01:08:14.867 --> 01:08:19.834
but to take diligent care of
him and I failed to do that.

1144
01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:28.400
I'm so sorry for everything.

1145
01:08:44.133 --> 01:08:47.500
is not meant in any wayhiss

1146
01:08:47.633 --> 01:08:50.967
to minimize your sorrow
and I apologize in advance.

1147
01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:53.333
if our discussion
sounds uncaring.

1148
01:08:53.467 --> 01:08:56.600
Now I'm gonna lay some
facts out for you.

1149
01:08:56.734 --> 01:08:57.834
but please keep in mind.

1150
01:08:57.967 --> 01:09:00.500
that you're free at any
time to get an attorney.

1151
01:09:00.633 --> 01:09:01.967
I met with an attorney

1152
01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:06.166
and I decided to try and
handle this myself for now.

1153
01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:10.567
Now there are two
reasons it benefits us

1154
01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:13.834
to sit down face to face and
try to work this out directly.

1155
01:09:13.967 --> 01:09:16.667
instead of referring
it to the courts.

1156
01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:20.033
First. it's expedient.
with this resolved.

1157
01:09:20.166 --> 01:09:22.667
you can devote your
emotions to your loss

1158
01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:24.500
and begin the process of healing

1159
01:09:24.633 --> 01:09:27.400
to whatever extent
that's possible.

1160
01:09:27.533 --> 01:09:29.734
Second. you don't give a
third of your money away

1161
01:09:29.867 --> 01:09:33.400
to an attorney and
that benefits us too.

1162
01:09:33.533 --> 01:09:35.233
I understand that.

1163
01:09:35.367 --> 01:09:37.734
Now. as you were
probably told.

1164
01:09:37.867 --> 01:09:40.700
you're not compensated
for loss of income.

1165
01:09:40.834 --> 01:09:43.834
because your son was not
providing for you financially.

1166
01:09:43.967 --> 01:09:47.166
So we're talking about
pain and suffering.

1167
01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:50.333
compensation for the loss
of comfort you suffer

1168
01:09:50.467 --> 01:09:52.333
from Henry's absence.

1169
01:09:52.467 --> 01:09:53.834
Now the law of this state-

1170
01:09:53.967 --> 01:09:55.667
Can-can.

1171
01:09:55.800 --> 01:10:00.333
can you just skip it and get
to the bottom line please?

1172
01:10:00.467 --> 01:10:01.433
Of course.

1173
01:10:03.333 --> 01:10:06.367
I'm prepared to
give you $50.000.

1174
01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:07.467
I accept.

1175
01:10:08.533 --> 01:10:10.567
That-that's not enough.

1176
01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:11.967
That's my decision.

1177
01:10:23.967 --> 01:10:25.333
Wait.

1178
01:10:25.467 --> 01:10:27.867
You need to come back. that
was just a starting offer.

1179
01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.700
they need to make you whole.

1180
01:10:29.834 --> 01:10:32.667
I was never
interested in the money.

1181
01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:35.000
it can't make me whole.

1182
01:10:35.133 --> 01:10:36.100
I-I didn't mean.

1183
01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:42.433
I know. I-I'm just trying
to do the right thing.

1184
01:10:49.467 --> 01:10:53.900
You are one of the few
people that he trusted.

1185
01:10:54.033 --> 01:10:57.033
Henry didn't like
doctors. but he liked you

1186
01:10:57.166 --> 01:11:02.166
and I should've known that
his trust was not misplaced.

1187
01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:07.066
He was a lot shrewder than
people gave him credit for.

1188
01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:12.633
The world can be a really
cruel place. Dr. Hodges.

1189
01:11:12.767 --> 01:11:16.133
people like Henry.

1190
01:11:16.266 --> 01:11:20.934
they bear the worst of it.

1191
01:11:21.066 --> 01:11:25.233
I was just so angry at myself.

1192
01:11:27.266 --> 01:11:30.800
I watched over
him his whole life

1193
01:11:30.934 --> 01:11:33.166
and I wasn't there

1194
01:11:35.567 --> 01:11:39.800
and I swore that I
would do everything.

1195
01:11:39.934 --> 01:11:43.567
everything in my
power to protect him.

1196
01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:49.300
I can't imagine how
hard that must have been.

1197
01:11:49.433 --> 01:11:50.900
stepping back.

1198
01:11:52.567 --> 01:11:54.900
but Henry was so
proud of everything.

1199
01:11:55.033 --> 01:11:56.233
that he had accomplished.

1200
01:11:56.367 --> 01:11:57.700
I let him down.

1201
01:11:59.033 --> 01:11:59.934
I let him down.

1202
01:12:00.133 --> 01:12:01.100
No. you didn't.

1203
01:12:03.834 --> 01:12:05.533
You believed in him.

1204
01:12:10.333 --> 01:12:14.967
The world needs more
doctors like you. not fewer.

1205
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.800
What the world really needs
is more mothers like you.

1206
01:12:23.834 --> 01:12:26.333
Hm.

1207
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.800
Now that is a first. I've
been at this some 36 years.

1208
01:12:47.934 --> 01:12:49.633
thought I'd seen it all.

1209
01:12:52.133 --> 01:12:54.967
The doctor wants to give
the claimant more money.

1210
01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:57.867
the deceased's
family wants less.

1211
01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.200
definitely a first and
that ain't the kicker.

1212
01:13:01.333 --> 01:13:03.433
I could cancel Dr.
Hodges' policy.

1213
01:13:03.567 --> 01:13:04.867
I could raise her premium

1214
01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.433
and you could probably
have a partners meeting

1215
01:13:07.567 --> 01:13:09.700
and vote her out
of your practice.

1216
01:13:09.834 --> 01:13:11.367
but I'm not gonna cancel her

1217
01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:14.100
and I'm asking you
not to vote her out.

1218
01:13:14.233 --> 01:13:16.266
Hey. if I were ever sick.

1219
01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:18.633
I'd want someone like
that taking care of me.

1220
01:13:21.166 --> 01:13:23.767
Ever wonder if some people
were put on this Earth

1221
01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:26.533
just to keep the rest of
us from getting stale?

1222
01:13:27.834 --> 01:13:29.734
Unfortunately. whether
she's permitted

1223
01:13:29.867 --> 01:13:31.967
to continue practicing
is out of my hands.

1224
01:13:50.066 --> 01:13:51.700
Dr. Fisher?

1225
01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:55.033
Peer Review Committee
hearing is tomorrow.

1226
01:13:56.867 --> 01:13:59.066
Okay. what. what
kind of actions can
they take against me?

1227
01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:04.000
The most extreme. they can
pull your hospital privileges.

1228
01:14:04.133 --> 01:14:05.934
Here I am thinking leaving
medicine is my decision. but-

1229
01:14:06.066 --> 01:14:08.800
Is that something you're
giving serious consideration?

1230
01:14:08.934 --> 01:14:09.934
Leaving?

1231
01:14:13.433 --> 01:14:18.600
I ju. I just wanna
do the right thing.

1232
01:14:18.734 --> 01:14:21.667
You became a
doctor for a reason.

1233
01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:25.367
you're respected and
you're competent.

1234
01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:30.934
but no matter what
the outcome is.

1235
01:14:31.066 --> 01:14:34.266
I couldn't be more proud of you.

1236
01:14:51.133 --> 01:14:53.300
Dr. Fisher!

1237
01:15:08.133 --> 01:15:11.500
The Peer Review Committee
has completed its review.

1238
01:15:11.633 --> 01:15:13.834
We're not going to rule
on the first issue.

1239
01:15:13.967 --> 01:15:15.333
whether you should have known

1240
01:15:15.467 --> 01:15:17.500
about your patient's
driving status.

1241
01:15:17.633 --> 01:15:19.834
We couldn't find a
standard of care.

1242
01:15:19.967 --> 01:15:22.567
that reflected comparable
factors in this case.

1243
01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:26.000
but on the second matter.
we unanimously agree.

1244
01:15:26.133 --> 01:15:28.233
that while your
intention was noble.

1245
01:15:28.367 --> 01:15:30.900
you should not have given
this patient your cell number

1246
01:15:31.033 --> 01:15:33.333
without also giving
explicit instructions

1247
01:15:33.467 --> 01:15:36.333
on what to do. if you
couldn't be reached.

1248
01:15:36.467 --> 01:15:38.834
We also agree that this
is not a cause for concern

1249
01:15:38.967 --> 01:15:40.533
about your ability.

1250
01:15:40.667 --> 01:15:43.400
however. you have only been
in practice for one year.

1251
01:15:43.533 --> 01:15:46.567
so ongoing scrutiny is advised.

1252
01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:49.667
Our recommendation
is that you be placed

1253
01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:51.233
on a one-year probation.

1254
01:15:51.367 --> 01:15:54.333
you will undergo subsequent
evaluation at that time.

1255
01:15:58.700 --> 01:16:01.467
I appreciate the review
and recommendation.

1256
01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:03.567
but it won't be necessary.

1257
01:16:05.033 --> 01:16:08.967
I've decided to
leave the practice.

1258
01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:12.600
That is not our recommendation.

1259
01:16:12.734 --> 01:16:16.133
Right now. I can't be the
doctor that my patients need

1260
01:16:16.266 --> 01:16:18.533
and they deserve nothing less.

1261
01:16:19.567 --> 01:16:21.600
If that is your decision.

1262
01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:42.567
There may be no
standard of care

1263
01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:45.133
on the driver's license
issue. but I wonder who here

1264
01:16:45.266 --> 01:16:47.734
would've handled
it any differently.

1265
01:16:56.567 --> 01:16:58.967
I'm not clear on what
you want me to report.

1266
01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:01.967
Give an update. tell
people how we resolved this.

1267
01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:05.967
The segment's called "On
the Hook." not "Off the Hook."

1268
01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:09.133
So let me ask you a
question. did you call her.

1269
01:17:09.266 --> 01:17:12.800
hear what she had to say before
my interview aired on TV?

1270
01:17:12.934 --> 01:17:16.367
We were just using her
as an example to show

1271
01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:19.467
how medical professionals
sometimes treat the handicapped.

1272
01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:22.467
An amicable
settlement isn't news.

1273
01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:23.734
But it's the truth.

1274
01:17:25.233 --> 01:17:29.667
Mrs. Larkin. the doctor
goofed. then apologized

1275
01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:33.900
and you forgave her.
there's no story there.

1276
01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:38.133
Let's go.

1277
01:17:38.266 --> 01:17:41.834
You know. um.

1278
01:17:41.967 --> 01:17:44.967
we don't like that word.

1279
01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:46.467
What word?

1280
01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:48.967
Handicapped. do you know
where that comes from?

1281
01:17:50.133 --> 01:17:53.300
There was legislation
in the 1500s.

1282
01:17:53.433 --> 01:17:55.834
begging was permitted
in the street

1283
01:17:55.967 --> 01:17:58.300
for people who were disabled.

1284
01:17:58.433 --> 01:18:02.367
Those who carried
their cap in hand

1285
01:18:03.734 --> 01:18:07.033
were considered worthless.

1286
01:18:07.166 --> 01:18:10.200
handicapped.

1287
01:18:10.333 --> 01:18:12.700
We don't like that word.

1288
01:18:36.333 --> 01:18:37.900
Dr. Hodges. we
have an emergency.

1289
01:18:38.033 --> 01:18:40.100
We have got a patient
having chest pains and think

1290
01:18:40.233 --> 01:18:42.100
he may need to go to
the cath lab right away.

1291
01:18:42.233 --> 01:18:43.100
Can you take a look?

1292
01:18:43.233 --> 01:18:44.567
Ah. I'm on leave.

1293
01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:46.266
I just needed to get some
things from my locker.

1294
01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:47.834
You should page Dr. Fisher.
- He's out.

1295
01:18:47.967 --> 01:18:50.433
Can you just look at the EKG
and let us know what to do?

1296
01:18:50.567 --> 01:18:52.367
I don't know how
much time he's got.

1297
01:18:57.667 --> 01:18:59.767
Diffuses to depression.

1298
01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:02.667
Code
blue in exam room B.

1299
01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:04.934
Code blue in exam room B.

1300
01:19:11.066 --> 01:19:14.100
- Okay.
- He's in V fib.

1301
01:19:14.233 --> 01:19:17.800
We're gonna need the paddles.

1302
01:19:17.934 --> 01:19:20.100
Leila. charge the
paddles to 200 joules.

1303
01:19:20.233 --> 01:19:22.834
Charging.

1304
01:19:22.967 --> 01:19:24.100
Yeah.

1305
01:19:24.233 --> 01:19:26.934
Stand back. stand
clear. ready to shock.

1306
01:19:27.066 --> 01:19:30.100
Shocking.

1307
01:19:30.233 --> 01:19:33.100
Let's go again. stand back.
stand clear. ready to shock.

1308
01:19:33.233 --> 01:19:36.000
Shocking.

1309
01:19:36.133 --> 01:19:39.100
We got rhythm. he's got
a pulse. but it's weak.

1310
01:19:39.233 --> 01:19:41.000
Start him on one
gram magnesium IV

1311
01:19:41.133 --> 01:19:42.633
and prep a lidocaine infusion.

1312
01:19:42.767 --> 01:19:44.600
Let's get him to
the cath lab stat.

1313
01:19:44.734 --> 01:19:45.934
Yeah.

1314
01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:36.300
I'd like to come
back on a limited basis

1315
01:20:36.433 --> 01:20:39.500
to see my patients. but I
want more time allocated

1316
01:20:39.633 --> 01:20:41.166
to each appointment.

1317
01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:44.500
So you're the one
on probation. but
you're dictating to me

1318
01:20:44.633 --> 01:20:46.934
the conditions by
which you'll work?

1319
01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:50.433
Hm.

1320
01:20:50.567 --> 01:20:51.834
Maybe.

1321
01:20:51.967 --> 01:20:53.333
Maybe?

1322
01:20:53.467 --> 01:20:55.033
Maybe I'll agree to that.

1323
01:20:56.934 --> 01:20:59.133
Are you ready to come back?

1324
01:20:59.266 --> 01:21:02.400
I am. this is where I belong.

1325
01:21:02.533 --> 01:21:05.333
You warned me that what
makes me a great doctor

1326
01:21:05.467 --> 01:21:07.166
could be my downfall.
if I let it.

1327
01:21:08.867 --> 01:21:12.000
that's a risk I'm
willing to take.

1328
01:21:12.133 --> 01:21:16.233
I don't ever wanna lose that
connection with my patients.

1329
01:21:16.367 --> 01:21:21.166
So can I expect you back
at the office tomorrow?

1330
01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:22.834
Monday. there are some things

1331
01:21:22.967 --> 01:21:24.834
I need to take care of first.

1332
01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:29.734
Yeah.

1333
01:21:32.467 --> 01:21:34.500
Come on. Will. kick it!

1334
01:21:35.567 --> 01:21:39.400
You got it. you got it!

1335
01:21:40.967 --> 01:21:44.900
Whoo!

1336
01:21:45.033 --> 01:21:50.000
That was awesome!

1337
01:21:51.967 --> 01:21:54.900
Hey. Charlie.

1338
01:21:55.033 --> 01:21:59.066
There you go. you hungry. buddy?

1339
01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:02.233
Let's get you something.

1340
01:22:19.367 --> 01:22:21.400
Excuse me. Captain.

1341
01:22:21.533 --> 01:22:23.767
Nervous flyer. can you
manage a brief chat

1342
01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:25.467
before we take off?
- Of course.

1343
01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:28.934
He'll talk to you for a
second. sometimes that helps.

1344
01:22:29.066 --> 01:22:30.400
Don't worry. he's nice.

1345
01:22:35.066 --> 01:22:35.934
Andie.

1346
01:22:36.066 --> 01:22:37.233
I went to Will's soccer game

1347
01:22:37.367 --> 01:22:39.033
and Mrs. Hecht
said you'd be here.

1348
01:22:40.266 --> 01:22:41.734
I just wanted to apologize.

1349
01:22:41.867 --> 01:22:43.967
You don't need to apologize.

1350
01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:46.133
I shouldn't have pushed
you away like that.

1351
01:22:46.266 --> 01:22:48.333
Some things you need
to do on your own.

1352
01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:51.900
Some things.

1353
01:22:52.033 --> 01:22:55.900
I don't want to. not anymore.

1354
01:22:56.033 --> 01:22:58.300
You don't have to.

1355
01:23:14.467 --> 01:23:16.166
I love you.

1356
01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:17.467
I love you too.

1357
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.200
Ladies and gentlemen. it
looks like it's gonna be

1358
01:23:26.333 --> 01:23:29.867
a fantastic flight.
settle back. relax

1359
01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.867
and imagine all
the amazing things.

1360
01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.734
that are gonna
happen to you today.
