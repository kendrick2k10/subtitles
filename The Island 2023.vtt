00:10:21.882 --> 00:10:24.580
my family will come after you
and everyone who loves you.

181
00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:25.625
Phil?

182
00:10:25.668 --> 00:10:26.930
- Till all of your lifeless
bodies

183
00:10:26.974 --> 00:10:28.279
are hanging from an overpass.

184
00:10:28.323 --> 00:10:30.499
- Hey. hey. Shut the fuck
up was not a request.

185
00:10:30.542 --> 00:10:33.154
Shut up. Phil!

186
00:10:33.197 --> 00:10:34.721
- You have the right to remain
silent.

187
00:10:34.764 --> 00:10:36.200
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

188
00:10:36.461 --> 00:10:37.506
[blows striking]

189
00:10:37.549 --> 00:10:38.899
[both groaning]

190
00:10:40.509 --> 00:10:42.119
[kick striking]

191
00:10:42.163 --> 00:10:43.555
You okay?

192
00:10:43.599 --> 00:10:46.036
[blows striking]

193
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.385
[dramatic music]

194
00:10:47.429 --> 00:10:49.518
- If you can't afford an
attorney

195
00:10:49.561 --> 00:10:51.476
one will be appointed for you.

196
00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.218
[kick striking]

197
00:10:54.262 --> 00:10:56.743
Have you understood these rights
as I have read them to you?

198
00:10:56.786 --> 00:11:00.050
Hey. amigo. Buddy?

199
00:11:00.094 --> 00:11:01.443
Ah. shit.

200
00:11:01.486 --> 00:11:04.228
Hey. Mark. do you think
he heard that last part

201
00:11:04.272 --> 00:11:06.535
or am I gonna have to read
him his whole Miranda rights

202
00:11:06.578 --> 00:11:09.799
warning all over again.
because I don't wanna.

203
00:11:09.843 --> 00:11:11.105
- Well. judging by his rap
sheet.

204
00:11:11.148 --> 00:11:12.584
I think he's heard it before.

205
00:11:12.628 --> 00:11:15.326
You. uh. look clean.

206
00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:17.241
Your guy. he was a lot smaller.

207
00:11:18.547 --> 00:11:21.245
- True. Maybe you should cuff
him.

208
00:11:21.289 --> 00:11:22.377
I don't know if you
have the punching power

209
00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:24.553
to keep him out very long.

210
00:11:24.596 --> 00:11:26.468
- Oh. he's got jokes.
and white pants. Heh.

211
00:11:28.383 --> 00:11:29.906
Hey. it is not a good time.

212
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:34.084
[soft mournful music]

213
00:12:12.209 --> 00:12:15.343
We are gathered here today

214
00:12:15.386 --> 00:12:17.301
to celebrate the life
of our brother Akheem.

215
00:12:20.565 --> 00:12:22.698
I have known Akheem's mother.
Yvonne.

216
00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:24.352
and his brother Mark for a long
time.

217
00:12:26.789 --> 00:12:29.009
I can remember the day Akheem
was born.

218
00:12:30.575 --> 00:12:34.492
bringing with him into this
world. and to this island.

219
00:12:34.536 --> 00:12:36.451
that infectious smile that all
of us

220
00:12:36.494 --> 00:12:38.453
would soon know and love.

221
00:12:39.584 --> 00:12:43.501
I ask all of you now to
remember fondly Akheem

222
00:12:43.545 --> 00:12:45.112
and his infectious smile.

223
00:12:46.635 --> 00:12:50.682
But also to let his
tragic death be a reminder

224
00:12:50.726 --> 00:12:53.511
that we must collectively
guard the lives of our youths.

225
00:12:55.687 --> 00:12:57.167
Because make no mistake about
it.

226
00:12:59.039 --> 00:13:02.607
whereas our island is
surely a gift from God.

227
00:13:02.651 --> 00:13:06.002
lest we forget the devil does
not strike at us from afar.

228
00:13:07.482 --> 00:13:11.703
No. He slithers along
the soil we call home.

229
00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:14.619
Waiting to coil around the feet

230
00:13:14.663 --> 00:13:16.665
of any who dare oppose him.

231
00:13:16.708 --> 00:13:20.103
[soft mournful music]

232
00:13:35.162 --> 00:13:38.034
Yvonne. I am so sorry.

233
00:13:40.689 --> 00:13:42.560
Thank you. Akilah.

234
00:13:42.604 --> 00:13:45.825
[soft piano music]

235
00:13:45.868 --> 00:13:49.045
Please. come see me soon.

236
00:13:50.873 --> 00:13:53.528
[Yvonne crying]

237
00:13:56.183 --> 00:13:58.663
- We never met. I'm Manuel
Alvarez.

238
00:13:58.707 --> 00:14:02.624
I'm terribly sorry. My deepest
condolence.

239
00:14:02.667 --> 00:14:06.584
[soft piano music]

240
00:14:06.628 --> 00:14:09.239
If there is anything I can do
for you. please let me know.

241
00:14:13.983 --> 00:14:16.203
I'm so sorry for your loss.

242
00:14:16.246 --> 00:14:19.119
[soft mournful music]

243
00:14:31.653 --> 00:14:33.568
[door closing]

244
00:14:33.611 --> 00:14:36.527
[soft mournful music]

245
00:14:38.703 --> 00:14:41.706
- I'm sorry. Son. I didn't get
a chance to clean the house.

246
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:43.012
Mom. it's fine. it's fine.

247
00:14:43.056 --> 00:14:44.144
- But I'm glad you're home.
baby.

248
00:14:44.187 --> 00:14:45.623
Me too.

249
00:14:45.667 --> 00:14:47.974
- Let me get you something
to eat. You must be hungry.

250
00:14:48.017 --> 00:14:50.150
- No. Mom. Mom. Mom. please.
please stop.

251
00:14:50.193 --> 00:14:51.673
I just want you to relax.

252
00:14:51.716 --> 00:14:54.502
You don't need to be doing
anything right now. Come. sit.

253
00:14:54.545 --> 00:14:55.329
Come. sit.

254
00:14:56.504 --> 00:14:59.333
- I have some things from your
brother.

255
00:14:59.376 --> 00:15:00.247
Okay.

256
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:02.423
[soft music]

257
00:15:23.966 --> 00:15:25.925
He was wearing that when ...

258
00:15:27.709 --> 00:15:29.450
I'd like you to have it.

259
00:15:29.493 --> 00:15:31.669
[soft music]

260
00:15:35.499 --> 00:15:36.631
Thanks. Mom.

261
00:15:36.674 --> 00:15:39.025
[soft music]

262
00:15:42.724 --> 00:15:43.725
Tell me what happened.

263
00:15:44.769 --> 00:15:46.641
I don't. I don't know.

264
00:15:46.684 --> 00:15:49.905
He got a job. and he was
staying out of trouble.

265
00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:51.863
Trouble?

266
00:15:51.907 --> 00:15:54.692
- A lot has changed over
the past seven years

267
00:15:54.736 --> 00:15:56.303
since you've been gone. Son.

268
00:15:56.346 --> 00:15:59.567
The island just isn't the same
anymore.

269
00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:00.829
- I'm gonna find out what
happened.

270
00:16:00.872 --> 00:16:04.789
- No. no. Mark. I just
lost one of my sons.

271
00:16:04.833 --> 00:16:06.704
I cannot lose another.

272
00:16:06.748 --> 00:16:09.142
Mom. listen to me. okay?

273
00:16:11.144 --> 00:16:14.799
Everything is gonna be
okay. Just trust me.

274
00:16:14.843 --> 00:16:16.018
Get some rest. okay?

275
00:16:17.628 --> 00:16:19.804
[Yvonne sobbing]

276
00:16:19.848 --> 00:16:22.764
[soft music]

277
00:16:22.807 --> 00:16:24.461
It's gonna be okay.

278
00:16:24.505 --> 00:16:27.638
[Yvonne crying]

279
00:16:27.682 --> 00:16:30.032
Hey. Mom. it's gonna be all
right.

280
00:16:30.076 --> 00:16:33.035
[Yvonne crying]

281
00:16:33.079 --> 00:16:34.558
Get some rest.

282
00:16:34.602 --> 00:16:36.865
Okay [cries].

283
00:16:36.908 --> 00:16:39.302
[soft music]

284
00:17:29.526 --> 00:17:32.007

[soft music]

287
00:17:59.991 --> 00:18:01.515
- I swear to God. it's not our
stuff.

288
00:18:01.558 --> 00:18:02.907
I'm telling you. tell him.

289
00:18:02.951 --> 00:18:04.692
- Yo. somebody put that
in our car. I promise you.

290
00:18:04.735 --> 00:18:06.085
- We've been set up. We were set
up.

291
00:18:06.128 --> 00:18:07.825
A complete misunderstanding.

292
00:18:07.869 --> 00:18:09.784
It's a big misunderstanding.
okay?

293
00:18:09.827 --> 00:18:10.785
It's the truth. I swear.

294
00:18:12.743 --> 00:18:14.832
[knocking on door]

295
00:18:14.876 --> 00:18:16.791
[Nate chuckling]

296
00:18:16.834 --> 00:18:18.097
Yes. Brother.

297
00:18:20.577 --> 00:18:21.404
Long time.

298
00:18:21.448 --> 00:18:22.666
Yeah. Sit down. sit down.

299
00:18:28.498 --> 00:18:29.847
I'm really sorry about Akheem.

300
00:18:31.806 --> 00:18:33.416
He was a good kid.

301
00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:34.243
Thank you.

302
00:18:35.984 --> 00:18:37.159
So what have you found out?

303
00:18:41.946 --> 00:18:45.428
- We go way back. so I'm just
gonna give it to you straight.

304
00:18:45.472 --> 00:18:48.475
We don't have the same
manpower that you do in LA.

305
00:18:48.518 --> 00:18:49.737
I remember.

306
00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:50.607
So this.

307
00:18:53.175 --> 00:18:54.611
this is gonna take some time.

308
00:18:57.179 --> 00:18:59.573
And right now. we don't have
a whole lot to go off of.

309
00:19:06.928 --> 00:19:08.973
This is all you have?

310
00:19:10.888 --> 00:19:12.325
- That's everything from the
table.

311
00:19:13.587 --> 00:19:15.023
Maybe a fight with the gangs.

312
00:19:15.066 --> 00:19:15.893
Gangs?

313
00:19:18.069 --> 00:19:20.855
- Yeah. there's been a lotta
crime

314
00:19:20.898 --> 00:19:22.900
here on the island since you
been gone.

315
00:19:22.944 --> 00:19:24.772
Especially with gangs
from neighboring islands

316
00:19:24.815 --> 00:19:25.903
coming here to party.

317
00:19:25.947 --> 00:19:27.818
The drug traffic is way up.

318
00:19:29.211 --> 00:19:31.953
- So you think this is
gang-related?

319
00:19:34.912 --> 00:19:35.739
Like I say.

320
00:19:37.306 --> 00:19:39.656
this is gonna take some time to
find out

321
00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:42.093
what actually happened.

322
00:19:42.137 --> 00:19:45.401
But when I do. you'll
be the first to know.

323
00:19:46.924 --> 00:19:48.012
All right.

Bye. Sensei.

350
00:20:36.844 --> 00:20:37.801
See you guys next week.

351
00:20:42.197 --> 00:20:44.199
So. how's the big city treating
you?

352
00:20:45.287 --> 00:20:47.942
- Well. not a day goes
by that I don't think

353
00:20:47.985 --> 00:20:51.772
about the island. if
that's what you're asking.

354
00:20:52.947 --> 00:20:54.035
But you left.

355
00:20:54.992 --> 00:20:56.080
And you know why I left?

356
00:20:57.995 --> 00:20:58.822
Yeah.

357
00:21:01.042 --> 00:21:02.957
So. um ...

358
00:21:04.393 --> 00:21:06.743

[soft music]

360
00:21:12.271 --> 00:21:13.097

Mark.

How long are you staying for?

377
00:22:04.497 --> 00:22:06.934
- Long enough to find out
what happened to Akheem.

378
00:22:08.239 --> 00:22:10.459
I went to the police
station to talk to Nate.

379
00:22:11.373 --> 00:22:14.245
He says there are gangs
here on the island.

380
00:22:14.289 --> 00:22:16.378
Unfortunately. yeah.

381
00:22:16.422 --> 00:22:18.815
The gangs come over on the
weekends from other islands

382
00:22:18.859 --> 00:22:21.209
and bring with them more drugs
and crime.

383
00:22:21.252 --> 00:22:23.994
But I wouldn't hold on to too
much hope

384
00:22:24.038 --> 00:22:26.127
in whatever Nate says or does.

385
00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:27.084
Why is that?

386
00:22:29.086 --> 00:22:31.741
- Because people around here
are afraid to make waves.

387
00:22:32.742 --> 00:22:33.569
I'm listening.

388
00:22:35.571 --> 00:22:39.183
- This guy. Manuel
Alvarez. everyone calls him

389
00:22:39.227 --> 00:22:40.881
the Company because he owns
everything

390
00:22:40.924 --> 00:22:43.057
that's important on the island.

391
00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:47.017
He owns the bank. construction
companies. hotels.

392
00:22:48.367 --> 00:22:51.848
In less than four years. he
basically managed to control

393
00:22:51.892 --> 00:22:54.503
the entire economy of the
island.

394
00:22:54.547 --> 00:22:57.114
Not to mention the only
places that the gangs seem

395
00:22:57.158 --> 00:23:00.161
to avoid are the businesses he
owns.

396
00:23:00.204 --> 00:23:01.467
And I'm pretty sure he controls
them too.

397
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:04.948
just to scare the people on the
island.

398
00:23:04.992 --> 00:23:07.298
So whether they like it
or not. a lot of people

399
00:23:07.342 --> 00:23:09.518
around here rely on him to
survive.

402
00:23:15.481 --> 00:23:17.613
- She's working at the bank
and told me in confidence

403
00:23:17.657 --> 00:23:20.050
that hundreds of millions
go through the bank now.

404
00:23:21.574 --> 00:23:23.967
- But what does that
have to do with Akheem?

405
00:23:26.317 --> 00:23:29.277
- Two months ago. Akheem took a
job

406
00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.149
as a bartender working for
Alvarez.

407

No.

So. how can I help you?

428
00:24:56.103 --> 00:24:58.061
My brother worked for you?

- He did. A lot of people work
for me.

430
00:25:02.065 --> 00:25:03.327
Mm. Here at this bar?

431
00:25:03.371 --> 00:25:06.417
- Yes. And he was a good
bartender.

432
00:25:06.461 --> 00:25:07.810
- So you're aware that
my brother was killed

433
00:25:07.854 --> 00:25:09.551
the night he was working here?

434
00:25:09.595 --> 00:25:12.249
You know. I don't think I like

435
00:25:12.293 --> 00:25:13.947

think?

What the fuck happened to my
brother?

may have gotten himself

you grew up on. Not anymore.

keeps telling me that.

Good and bad. I'm afraid.

that. Changes are coming.

551
00:31:46.034 --> 00:31:47.557
- You wanna tell me about my
brother now?

552
00:31:47.601 --> 00:31:48.907
Fuck your brother.

- That's right. Had it. didn't
need it.

558
00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:11.190
I could use it now if you like.

559
00:32:13.583 --> 00:32:16.195
- I don't know him. I never met
him.

560
00:32:16.238 --> 00:32:17.848
We were just told to fuck some
dude up

561
00:32:17.892 --> 00:32:18.806
looking for his brother.

562
00:32:19.894 --> 00:32:21.809
That's all I know. I swear.

Yo. you guys see him anywhere?

586
00:33:49.897 --> 00:33:51.377
Shit. we lost him.

587
00:33:53.074 --> 00:33:53.857

Fuck. I'll call him.

591
00:34:11.571 --> 00:34:13.486
We lost him.

592
00:34:13.529 --> 00:34:15.836
- [Manuel] That's very
disappointing.

593
00:34:15.879 --> 00:34:18.230
I will deal with your failures
later.

594
00:34:18.273 --> 00:34:21.929
Go to the mother's house.
Use her to flush him out.

595
00:34:21.972 --> 00:34:23.061
Understood.

[suspenseful music]

605
00:36:40.763 --> 00:36:42.200
Here you go.

606
00:36:42.243 --> 00:36:43.679
Thank you.

607
00:36:43.723 --> 00:36:44.506
Don't mention it.

608
00:36:48.249 --> 00:36:51.383
Yvonne. everything is going to
be okay.

609
00:36:52.253 --> 00:36:54.777
He's going to be okay.

610
00:36:54.821 --> 00:36:58.607

mother. you always have to worry.

[soft piano music]

612
00:37:02.916 --> 00:37:05.962
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.

613
00:37:06.006 --> 00:37:07.094
I'm so sorry.

614
00:37:07.137 --> 00:37:08.095
It's okay.

615
00:37:10.358 --> 00:37:12.926
You know I really wish
that I could tell you

616
00:37:12.969 --> 00:37:15.145
that after losing a child it
gets easier.

617
00:37:16.843 --> 00:37:18.671
But even after seven years.

618
00:37:20.716 --> 00:37:21.587
it doesn't.

619
00:37:25.634 --> 00:37:27.984

You two good?

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

623
00:37:34.948 --> 00:37:36.297
- You have a first-aid kit?

624
00:37:36.341 --> 00:37:38.212
Yeah. I'll go grab it.

625
00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:39.344
All right.

626

[police radio chattering]

627
00:37:45.915 --> 00:37:47.830
All right. so what we got?

628
00:37:47.874 --> 00:37:50.659
- We have a DOA. The rest
have gone on to the hospital.

629
00:37:52.966 --> 00:37:55.838
- Jesus Christ. These boys got
hit hard.

630
00:37:57.405 --> 00:37:58.319
Who else see it?

631
00:37:58.363 --> 00:37:59.059
No one's talking.

632
00:38:00.321 --> 00:38:02.802
[Nate sighing]

633
00:38:02.845 --> 00:38:04.238
- All right. I'll take it from
here.

634
00:38:04.282 --> 00:38:05.674
Just make sure you secure the
perimeter.

635
00:38:05.718 --> 00:38:06.501
Yes. sir.

636
00:38:08.068 --> 00:38:08.895
Excuse me. sir.

637
00:38:08.938 --> 00:38:10.288
Yes. Officer.

638
00:38:10.331 --> 00:38:11.637
- The station has been
trying to get hold of you.

639
00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:12.855
What is it?

640
00:38:12.899 --> 00:38:13.943
- They say there's a possible
crime scene

641
00:38:13.987 --> 00:38:15.423
that you'd want to know about.

642
00:38:16.772 --> 00:38:18.339
- I have a crime scene here
already.

643
00:38:18.383 --> 00:38:20.950
- It's at Akheem's mother's
house.

644
00:38:20.994 --> 00:38:23.039
[soft dramatic music]

645
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:25.128
Tell them I'm on my way.

646
00:38:25.172 --> 00:38:26.347
Okay. sir.

647
00:38:26.391 --> 00:38:28.262

648
00:38:35.138 --> 00:38:37.010
[knocking on door]

649
00:38:42.189 --> 00:38:44.800
Good thing nobody was home.

650
00:38:44.844 --> 00:38:45.845
This time.

651
00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:51.067
- Any idea what happened
to a buncha gang members

652
00:38:51.111 --> 00:38:52.939
earlier tonight at the beach
bar?

653
00:38:52.982 --> 00:38:54.897
Hm?

654
00:38:55.376 --> 00:38:57.204
- Any idea what happened
to my brother or who tried

655
00:38:57.247 --> 00:38:59.075
to break into my mother's
house and kill her?

656
00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:03.950
- You have no idea what you
are asking of me right now.

657
00:39:05.821 --> 00:39:08.694
This? This is so much
bigger than your brother.

658
00:39:09.999 --> 00:39:13.176
- You're right. It's not gonna
stop.

659
00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:15.135
Not unless you help me to make
it stop.

660
00:39:17.093 --> 00:39:17.964
- I think you already know the
answers

661
00:39:18.007 --> 00:39:19.792
to the questions you're asking.

662
00:39:19.835 --> 00:39:22.490
This is our island. our home.

663
00:39:24.536 --> 00:39:27.974
My father build this
house with his bare hands

664
00:39:28.017 --> 00:39:29.584
just like your father built
yours.

665
00:39:30.933 --> 00:39:33.240
They wanted my mother to be
there. Nate.

666
00:39:34.415 --> 00:39:35.547
Changes are coming.

667
00:39:37.462 --> 00:39:39.855
And you need to decide
what side of those changes

668
00:39:39.899 --> 00:39:41.379
you're gonna be standing on.

669
00:39:41.422 --> 00:39:44.556
[soft dramatic music]

670
00:39:53.347 --> 00:39:54.914
- Speak to the Luna's new
singer.

671
00:39:56.306 --> 00:39:58.047
One of my informants
told me she was working

672
00:39:58.091 --> 00:39:59.832
the night your brother was
killed.

673
00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:02.356
Her name's Nora.

674
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.837
She's staying at the motel
by the church. Room 18.

675
00:40:06.099 --> 00:40:08.057
[soft dramatic music]

676
00:40:08.101 --> 00:40:09.537
Is your mother somewhere safe?

677
00:40:10.451 --> 00:40:11.017
Yeah.

678
00:40:13.193 --> 00:40:14.499
At Akilah's place.

679
00:40:15.761 --> 00:40:16.544
Good.

680
00:40:19.155 --> 00:40:20.505
I need to trust you. Nate.

681
00:40:22.158 --> 00:40:25.205
This island needs help.
and I can't do it alone.

682
00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:28.774
[soft dramatic music]

683
00:40:49.142 --> 00:40:52.058
[lighter clicking]

684
00:40:54.626 --> 00:40:58.281
- I don't think the word
disappointed carries enough weight

685
00:40:58.325 --> 00:41:00.109
for what I'm feeling right now.

686
00:41:00.153 --> 00:41:02.416
- We did what you asked. Boss.
after we lost him in town.

687
00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:06.507
but the house. it's empty.

688
00:41:06.551 --> 00:41:08.901
They must have known someone was
coming.

689
00:41:08.944 --> 00:41:11.469
So. this was my fault?

690
00:41:11.991 --> 00:41:14.210
- No. no. that's not what I
meant. no.

691
00:41:14.254 --> 00:41:16.865
- Sh. It's okay. forget about
it.

692
00:41:18.345 --> 00:41:19.825
You tried. right?

693
00:41:19.868 --> 00:41:22.001
You did the best you could
with the information you had.

694
00:41:22.044 --> 00:41:24.046
but they knew you were coming.

695
00:41:25.091 --> 00:41:25.918
Right?

696
00:41:26.962 --> 00:41:28.224
- Y-yes. sir. Y-yes. sir.

697
00:41:30.705 --> 00:41:32.664
Hey. hey. take it easy.

698
00:41:33.708 --> 00:41:36.450
Take a deep breath before
you're hyperventilating.

699
00:41:36.494 --> 00:41:38.104

[assailant gasping]

701
00:41:47.983 --> 00:41:50.377
One thing I can't stand is
excuses.

702
00:41:51.552 --> 00:41:53.119
And a lack of accountability.

703
00:41:54.033 --> 00:41:56.992
[assailant gasping]

704
00:41:58.341 --> 00:41:59.168
Please.

705
00:42:01.431 --> 00:42:02.432
Please. please!

706
00:42:05.958 --> 00:42:06.436
So.

707
00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:07.525
Fuck.

708
00:42:07.568 --> 00:42:10.179
- let's get back
to the accountability.

709
00:42:12.312 --> 00:42:13.792
Please. no no no!
Wait wait wait. wait!

710
00:42:13.835 --> 00:42:16.142
I have a photo. in my pocket.

711
00:42:16.185 --> 00:42:19.275

[soft dramatic music]

713
00:42:26.065 --> 00:42:27.457
I think I know how to get this
guy.

714
00:42:27.501 --> 00:42:30.025
She. she's a local. Runs the
island dojo.

715
00:42:31.461 --> 00:42:33.594
[gun firing]

716
00:42:33.638 --> 00:42:35.988

[soft dramatic music]

718
00:42:43.909 --> 00:42:44.953
Are you gonna come back inside

719
00:42:44.997 --> 00:42:46.172
and finish fucking me or what?

720
00:42:47.956 --> 00:42:49.044
I'll be back in a moment.

721
00:42:50.785 --> 00:42:53.832
- This cop? More trouble than we
expected.

722
00:42:54.746 --> 00:42:57.183
He put the boys in the
north gang in the hospital.

Of course.

Dayana and I wish that there
was more we could do to help.

mother.

959

I'm not staying.

960
01:00:30.365 --> 01:00:31.497
Akilah. you need to stay here.

961
01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:35.109

last time I came to church.

As one of God's children.

977

all that matters is that you are
here now.

Go on. What is on your mind. my
son?

979
01:01:44.918 --> 01:01:46.354

do something for me.

Please keep it safe.

981
01:01:51.403 --> 01:01:53.187
- I don't understand. What is
it?

982
01:01:54.536 --> 01:01:56.408
If anything happens to me.

983
01:01:56.451 --> 01:01:58.018

I take care. don't worry about
it. okay?

991
01:02:27.744 --> 01:02:29.528
I might have a solution.

992
01:02:29.571 --> 01:02:32.009
- You better. because if they
have her.

993
01:02:32.052 --> 01:02:34.185
then she can testify against
you.

994
01:02:34.228 --> 01:02:35.447
I'll find her.

995
01:02:35.490 --> 01:02:36.970
No you won't.

996
01:02:37.014 --> 01:02:39.016
If she's gone. it means they got
to her.

997
01:02:40.017 --> 01:02:42.367
And if they got to her. then
that means

998
01:02:42.410 --> 01:02:44.673
they can bring an international
warrant against me.

999
01:02:46.545 --> 01:02:48.677
And if you're still here.

1000
01:02:48.721 --> 01:02:51.768
it means that little piece
of shit is still breathing.

1001

play.

if you're willing to play it.

1003

it. Do what it takes.

It's messy.

1005

- Everything I did for this
island

1006
01:03:01.952 --> 01:03:04.476
is in jeopardy because of this
man!

1007
01:03:04.519 --> 01:03:07.696

I have to. believe me.

01:03:33.505 --> 01:03:34.854
Nate make a case against him.

1012
01:03:34.898 --> 01:03:37.204
And put an end to all of this.

1013
01:03:37.248 --> 01:03:39.163
With that singer's testimony.

1014
01:03:39.206 --> 01:03:41.426
he'll spend the rest of his life
in jail.

1015
01:03:41.469 --> 01:03:44.342
- Because guys like him
don't end up in jail. Akilah.

1016
01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:48.389
- Mark. he's never going to
stop.

1017
01:03:48.433 --> 01:03:49.173
And neither am I.

1018
01:03:51.828 --> 01:03:53.220
There's only one way this ends.

1019
01:03:56.049 --> 01:04:00.227
- To carry a life inside
of me. for nine months.

1020
01:04:01.402 --> 01:04:03.361
one that you and I created
together.

1021
01:04:05.711 --> 01:04:08.801
And to never get to hear her
cry.

1022
01:04:10.716 --> 01:04:13.806
Or see her open her eyes to look
at me.

1023
01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:16.156
To never get to hold her against
my skin.

1024
01:04:17.375 --> 01:04:19.246
Or see her take her first steps.

1025
01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:22.032
Or watch her grow up.

1026
01:04:23.076 --> 01:04:23.860
Akilah.

1027
01:04:23.903 --> 01:04:26.253
It broke me. in more ways

1028
01:04:26.297 --> 01:04:27.646
than I ever thought was
possible.

1029
01:04:30.388 --> 01:04:35.088
I was so. so numb to everything
that wasn't heartache.

1030
01:04:37.961 --> 01:04:39.049
And I know it broke you too.

1031
01:04:40.702 --> 01:04:43.488
It broke you so much
that you had to leave.

1032
01:04:43.531 --> 01:04:45.446
- Akilah. why are you
talking about this now?

1033
01:04:45.490 --> 01:04:47.884
- Because nothing that either of
us does

1034
01:04:47.927 --> 01:04:49.146
will ever bring her back.

1035
01:04:50.277 --> 01:04:51.800
She's gone. Mark.

1036
01:04:51.844 --> 01:04:54.542
You can't save her.

1037
01:04:54.586 --> 01:04:56.588
But I can save our island.

1038
01:04:56.631 --> 01:04:57.806
But at what cost?

1039
01:05:00.331 --> 01:05:02.463
I don't want to lose you too.

1040
01:05:05.553 --> 01:05:07.642
I don't think that I could
take being broken anymore.

1041
01:05:09.253 --> 01:05:10.428
You will never lose me.

1086
01:07:49.978 --> 01:07:51.893
For the rights of the destitute.

1087
01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:56.855
To speak up. To judge fairly.

1088
01:07:56.898 --> 01:07:59.553
Reach out to someone in your
community.

1089
01:07:59.597 --> 01:08:00.902
One of your neighbors.

1090
01:08:00.946 --> 01:08:03.949
Help those less fortunate than
yourself.

1091
01:08:05.124 --> 01:08:06.517
This is what God--

1092
01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:08.823
[door opening]

1093
01:08:08.867 --> 01:08:12.175
- I'm sorry. Father. May I
please speak with everyone?

1094
01:08:12.218 --> 01:08:14.438
Just for a moment?

1095
01:08:14.481 --> 01:08:15.613
Here.

1096
01:08:15.656 --> 01:08:16.179
Thank you.

1097
01:08:22.272 --> 01:08:26.058
My family immigrated to
this island from the States

1098
01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:28.930
when I was only two years old.

1099
01:08:28.974 --> 01:08:33.935
Many of this community helped
us to build a new life here.

1100
01:08:34.327 --> 01:08:36.112
so that we could call
this island our home.

1101
01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:41.204
Now look. I know many of you

1102
01:08:41.247 --> 01:08:44.685
rely on the jobs and the many
businesses

1103
01:08:44.729 --> 01:08:48.428
owned by Manuel Alvarez.

1104
01:08:49.951 --> 01:08:51.127
But I'm here to tell you

1105
01:08:52.867 --> 01:08:55.131
that he has taken Akilah hostage

1106
01:08:56.828 --> 01:08:58.917
and has killed both my brother
Akheem

1107
01:09:00.223 --> 01:09:04.618
and now. my friend. our
police chief. Nate Wayland.

1108
01:09:04.662 --> 01:09:07.969
[congregation gasping]

1109
01:09:08.013 --> 01:09:10.929
Nate Wayland died an honorable
man.

1110
01:09:10.972 --> 01:09:14.193
who fought for what's
right and for the island

1111
01:09:14.237 --> 01:09:17.283
that we love and have called
home.

1112
01:09:17.327 --> 01:09:22.201
Please. don't let him or
my brother die in vain.

1113
01:09:23.289 --> 01:09:24.682
Help me find Akilah.

1114
01:09:26.292 --> 01:09:28.947
And help me put an end to this
devil

1115
01:09:28.990 --> 01:09:32.385
who has coiled himself around
all our feet

1116
01:09:32.429 --> 01:09:35.171
and is trying to choke the
life out of our island.

1117
01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:40.306
Please. if you hear or see
anything.

1118
01:09:42.003 --> 01:09:43.831
reach out to me at the police
station.

1119
01:09:45.268 --> 01:09:46.094
Thank you.

1120
01:09:47.705 --> 01:09:49.315
- That concludes everything for
today.

1121
01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:55.016
Mark? A moment please.

1122
01:09:56.104 --> 01:09:58.759
[birds singing]

1123
01:10:04.939 --> 01:10:06.245
Nate asked me to hold onto it.

1124
01:10:09.248 --> 01:10:10.336
What is it?

1125
01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:11.468
I don't know.

1126
01:10:11.511 --> 01:10:13.209
He said. if something happened
to him.

1127
01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:16.821
And with his passing. I just
think

1128
01:10:16.864 --> 01:10:18.039
he would want you to have it.

1129
01:10:19.650 --> 01:10:20.999
Thank you. Father.

1130
01:10:21.042 --> 01:10:23.828
[dramatic music]

1131
01:10:30.835 --> 01:10:32.358
Wake up. bitch [laughs]!

1132
01:10:37.363 --> 01:10:38.190
Where am I?

1133
01:10:41.802 --> 01:10:43.500
What do you want with me?

1134
01:10:45.328 --> 01:10:46.242
Answer me!

1135
01:10:47.199 --> 01:10:50.376
[soft dramatic music]

1136
01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:53.161
- She's not answering you
because she don't work for you.

1137
01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:55.947
She work for me.

1138
01:10:59.211 --> 01:11:04.042
[sighs] And I'm getting really
tired

1139
01:11:04.085 --> 01:11:07.001
of your boyfriend getting in my
way.

1140
01:11:07.045 --> 01:11:10.266
- Then you're really gonna
be upset when he kills you.

1141
01:11:10.309 --> 01:11:12.920
Oh. aren't you a clever one?

1142
01:11:15.053 --> 01:11:18.317
But it's going to be hard to
be clever without a tongue.

1143
01:11:19.753 --> 01:11:20.711
[Akilah spitting]

1144
01:11:20.754 --> 01:11:23.061
[hand slapping]

1145
01:11:23.104 --> 01:11:24.497
- You're gonna pay for that.
bitch.

1146
01:11:25.803 --> 01:11:27.718
Then just get it over with and
kill me now

1147
01:11:27.761 --> 01:11:28.980
if you're really gonna do it.

1148
01:11:29.023 --> 01:11:31.199
In time. I'll do just that.

1149
01:11:32.418 --> 01:11:37.423
But unfortunately for
you. it won't be quick.

1150
01:11:37.467 --> 01:11:42.385
No. I'm going to take my
time and enjoy so much.

1151
01:11:45.039 --> 01:11:49.870
Eventually. you'll beg me to
kill you.

1152
01:11:49.914 --> 01:11:52.917
[Akilah breathing hard]

1153
01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:56.921
[soft suspenseful music]

1154
01:11:56.964 --> 01:11:58.183
Don't leave her sight.

1155
01:12:02.361 --> 01:12:04.581
[laughing]

1156
01:12:04.624 --> 01:12:07.105
[dramatic music]

1157
01:12:15.374 --> 01:12:16.201
Everyone.

1158
01:12:17.637 --> 01:12:18.421
Listen up.

1159
01:12:19.378 --> 01:12:22.033
[phone ringing]

1160
01:12:23.948 --> 01:12:25.950
Nate was a good man who died

1161
01:12:25.993 --> 01:12:28.518
fighting to protect this island.

1162
01:12:28.561 --> 01:12:33.087
And now. I have taken over
as acting chief of police

1163
01:12:33.131 --> 01:12:36.090
so I can do what needs to be
done.

1164
01:12:36.134 --> 01:12:40.573
Now if any of you would like
to leave. you can leave now.

1165
01:12:43.881 --> 01:12:44.664
Good.

1166
01:12:45.839 --> 01:12:48.059
Now the first thing I want you
to do

1167
01:12:48.102 --> 01:12:50.235
is get the word out all across
the island

1168
01:12:50.278 --> 01:12:54.239
that I will be here. waiting for
Alvarez.

1169
01:12:54.282 --> 01:12:57.024
[suspenseful music]

1170
01:13:16.783 --> 01:13:19.003
[Mark exhaling]

[keys clicking]

1173
01:13:30.231 --> 01:13:31.058
Ah.

1174
01:13:31.363 --> 01:13:34.105
[suspenseful music]

1175
01:13:35.498 --> 01:13:36.063
Okay.

1176
01:13:37.761 --> 01:13:39.110
Cartel drug money.

1177
01:13:40.459 --> 01:13:43.723
You've been building
a case against Alvarez

1178
01:13:43.767 --> 01:13:45.595
for money laundering.

1179
01:13:47.161 --> 01:13:49.250
Mm. gotcha.

1180
01:13:51.165 --> 01:13:54.168
[children laughing]

1181
01:13:55.996 --> 01:13:56.954
I won!

1182
01:13:56.997 --> 01:13:59.478
No fair. You're taller.

1183
01:13:59.522 --> 01:14:00.436
[birds singing]

1184
01:14:00.479 --> 01:14:02.133
Look. Desmond.

1185
01:14:02.176 --> 01:14:02.960
Who's that?

1186
01:14:03.003 --> 01:14:03.917
Sh.

1187
01:14:04.875 --> 01:14:05.963
Come on.

1188
01:14:06.006 --> 01:14:09.140
[soft suspenseful music]

1189
01:14:15.494 --> 01:14:17.148
That's the guy who's always with
him.

1190
01:14:21.718 --> 01:14:22.283
Did he see us?

1191
01:14:22.327 --> 01:14:23.197
No.

1192
01:14:23.241 --> 01:14:25.025
Come on. Let's get outta here.

1193
01:14:27.332 --> 01:14:29.987
[phone buzzing]

1194
01:14:34.382 --> 01:14:35.862
Hello.

1195
01:14:35.906 --> 01:14:37.951
- A police officer just came
here looking for the boss.

1196
01:14:37.995 --> 01:14:39.387
What'd you tell him?

1197
01:14:39.431 --> 01:14:41.389
- That he wasn't here and
I don't know where he is.

1198
01:14:41.433 --> 01:14:43.000
- All right. you did the right
thing.

1199
01:14:43.043 --> 01:14:44.349
Wait. there's more.

1200
01:14:44.392 --> 01:14:46.177
Before he left. he told
me that Mark has replaced

1201
01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:48.222
the chief of police and
now he's at the station

1202
01:14:48.266 --> 01:14:49.833
waiting for the boss to make a
move.

1203
01:14:51.138 --> 01:14:51.922
Understood.

1204
01:14:53.097 --> 01:14:55.795
[phone beeping]

1205
01:14:55.839 --> 01:14:58.145
[knocking on door]

1206
01:14:58.189 --> 01:15:01.148
- Excuse me. sir. these two
children say that they saw

1207
01:15:01.192 --> 01:15:03.542
something and may be able to
help you.

1208
01:15:03.586 --> 01:15:04.978
Oh. Hello. kids.

1209
01:15:05.936 --> 01:15:08.068
So. what did you see?

1210
01:15:08.112 --> 01:15:09.417
Mr. Mark?

1211
01:15:09.461 --> 01:15:11.028
Just Mark is fine.

1212
01:15:11.071 --> 01:15:12.029
We saw him.

1213
01:15:12.856 --> 01:15:14.074
Who did you see?

1214
01:15:14.118 --> 01:15:17.295
- The man who is always
with the Manuel guy.

1215
01:15:17.338 --> 01:15:21.081
- Oh. mean-looking guy. looks
like Mr. Clean. never smiles?

1216
01:15:21.125 --> 01:15:22.082
Yeah. that's him.

1217
01:15:23.562 --> 01:15:25.564
So. where was this?

1218
01:15:25.608 --> 01:15:28.785
- We saw him at the old
abandoned hotel.

1219
01:15:28.828 --> 01:15:30.003
The one by the water?

1220
01:15:30.047 --> 01:15:30.874
Yep.

1221
01:15:33.529 --> 01:15:35.705
You two kids did very well.

1222
01:15:35.748 --> 01:15:40.187
But listen. do not go
anywhere near there. okay?

1223
01:15:40.231 --> 01:15:42.842
And tell nobody. It's
very. very important.

1224
01:15:42.886 --> 01:15:43.669
- Okay.
- Okay.

1225
01:15:44.801 --> 01:15:46.672
All right. run along.

1226
01:15:48.892 --> 01:15:49.675
Thanks. Sergeant.

1227
01:15:53.113 --> 01:15:55.028
Awfully young for some CIs.

1228
01:15:56.508 --> 01:15:58.510
- Phil. what the hell are you
doing here?

1229
01:15:58.554 --> 01:16:00.556
- Not exactly a warm island
welcome.

1230
01:16:00.599 --> 01:16:02.558
It's nice to see you too.
partner.

1231
01:16:02.601 --> 01:16:05.212
This does not concern you.

1232
01:16:05.256 --> 01:16:07.432
Oh. it doesn't concern me.

1233
01:16:07.475 --> 01:16:12.089
Well. um. I have been
stashing potential witnesses

1234
01:16:12.132 --> 01:16:14.352
for you in safe houses
and running fingerprints

1235
01:16:14.395 --> 01:16:16.572
for your buddy Nate on a
Colombia sicario

1236
01:16:16.615 --> 01:16:18.399
working for the Cali Cartel.

1237
01:16:18.443 --> 01:16:20.140
But. sure. it doesn't concern
me.

1238
01:16:20.184 --> 01:16:22.012
I'm good. by the way.
Thank you. for not asking.

1239
01:16:25.102 --> 01:16:26.320
How's the girl?

1240
01:16:26.364 --> 01:16:29.236
- She's safe. Hence the word
safe house.

1241
01:16:30.281 --> 01:16:31.151
How's your buddy Nate?

1242
01:16:32.413 --> 01:16:34.459
Well he's been killed.

1243
01:16:34.502 --> 01:16:37.288
Hence. why I'm sitting at his
desk.

1244
01:16:39.551 --> 01:16:42.598
- Then I guess you need my
help more than I thought.

1245
01:16:42.641 --> 01:16:45.165
Come on. cut the bullshit.
man. Catch me up.

At the old sugar factory in
ruin.

1254

Come alone. Unarmed.

1255

And bring Nora. I'll bring
Akilah.

1256
01:17:25.205 --> 01:17:27.120
I need to know she's alive.

1257
01:17:35.172 --> 01:17:37.870
- Your boyfriend. he want
to know you're still alive.

1258
01:17:37.914 --> 01:17:40.830
- Mark. don't worry about
me! Kill the bastard!

Okay. Dad.

I'm embarrassed you think
it's gonna take me that long.

1280
01:19:20.407 --> 01:19:22.105
- Well I'm accounting for
four minutes of your blabbing

1281
01:19:22.148 --> 01:19:24.368
and one minute of actual action.

1282
01:19:24.411 --> 01:19:25.586
- You know. this only works
if one of us is the funny one

1283
01:19:25.630 --> 01:19:27.719
and the other one's mean and
gruff. right?

1284
01:19:27.763 --> 01:19:30.635
- Hurry the fuck up and
save Akilah. Better?

1285
01:19:30.678 --> 01:19:33.029

really

1302
01:21:23.922 --> 01:21:25.619
in a position to negotiate here.

1303
