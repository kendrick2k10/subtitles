- Locals
believe this is the work

22
00:01:11.675 --> 00:01:13.906
of the legendary Jersey
Devil. while authorities

23
00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:16.480

killed Cameron Connor.

25
00:01:17.681 --> 00:01:18.847

to capture a photograph or
find out if it really exists.

53
00:02:08.666 --> 00:02:10.204
- They believe
it was silently

54
00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.206

mysteriously vanished.

55
00:02:12.241 --> 00:02:14.604

- I can't believe that was
our last day of school ever!

58
00:02:31.557 --> 00:02:32.919
Finally. freedom!

59
00:02:32.954 --> 00:02:35.493
- Are you forgetting
about college?

60
00:02:35.528 --> 00:02:37.561
- This weekend is
going to be amazing!

61
00:02:37.596 --> 00:02:38.727
- Right. it's gonna be fire!

62
00:02:38.762 --> 00:02:39.992
- Hey. have a great weekend.

63
00:02:40.027 --> 00:02:42.335
- Oh. you too. man.

64
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.436
- Ah. crap. we're so late!

65
00:02:44.471 --> 00:02:45.569
- Your dad's gonna kill us.

66
00:02:45.604 --> 00:02:46.801
- You'll be fine!

67
00:02:46.836 --> 00:02:50.244
- Your dad will
not be fine. Kelsey.

68
00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:52.246
- Sweet ride!

69
00:02:52.281 --> 00:02:53.412
- Can we move it?

70
00:02:54.547 --> 00:02:56.008
- After I drop
you kids off. I've

71
00:02:56.043 --> 00:02:58.483
gotta take a client all the way
to Long Island in this thing.

72
00:02:58.518 --> 00:02:59.781
- Told you he'd be mad!

73
00:03:03.853 --> 00:03:04.489
Hold on.

74
00:03:06.493 --> 00:03:07.954
- What's wrong?

75
00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:09.296
- I don't know.

76
00:03:09.331 --> 00:03:10.693
Maybe I should drive?

77
00:03:10.728 --> 00:03:11.991
- What are you talking about?

78
00:03:12.026 --> 00:03:12.825
This was your idea.

79
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.368
- Besides. we can't
take your car.

80
00:03:15.403 --> 00:03:16.028
- It's OK.

81
00:03:16.063 --> 00:03:16.595
My dad's not mad.

82
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.338
He's just in a hurry.

83
00:03:18.373 --> 00:03:19.504
- He's just in a hurry.

84
00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:21.770
Come on. it's all right.

85
00:03:21.805 --> 00:03:23.640
- Hey. guys. happy graduation!

86
00:03:23.675 --> 00:03:24.641
- Thanks. Suzie!

87
00:03:24.676 --> 00:03:26.379
I see dad's in a good mood.

88
00:03:26.414 --> 00:03:28.480
- He's just frustrated
he has to entertain one

89
00:03:28.515 --> 00:03:29.910
of his high rollers tonight.

90
00:03:29.945 --> 00:03:33.287
He would rather be
supervising you.

91
00:03:33.322 --> 00:03:35.454
Hi. I'm Suzie. your server.

92
00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:36.554
- Hey. James!

93
00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:37.918
- Let me know if
you need anything.

94
00:03:37.953 --> 00:03:38.622
- OK.

95
00:03:42.694 --> 00:03:44.727
Hey. buddy.

96
00:03:44.762 --> 00:03:46.025
This is awesome!

97
00:03:49.536 --> 00:03:50.667
- Sorry. daddy.

98
00:03:54.035 --> 00:03:55.672
- Sorry. sir.

99
00:03:55.707 --> 00:03:57.773
- Sorry. Uncle Greg.

100
00:03:57.808 --> 00:03:59.808
- We were just saying
bye to our friends.

101
00:03:59.843 --> 00:04:01.711
We'll probably never
see most of them again.

102
00:04:01.746 --> 00:04:02.778
- I get it!

103
00:04:02.813 --> 00:04:04.076
I was young once.

104
00:04:04.111 --> 00:04:05.077
- You were?

105
00:04:05.112 --> 00:04:06.145
- Stop it.

106
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.422
Look. I just can't be late
picking up this client.

107
00:04:09.457 --> 00:04:10.621
James. we're all here.

108
00:04:10.656 --> 00:04:12.084
- You got it. boss.

109
00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:15.494
- Alex. glad to see you
dressed for the occasion.

110
00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:17.364
- Oh. I am.

111
00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:17.991
I came prepared.

112
00:04:22.833 --> 00:04:25.438
- Dad. if you're
the boss. why do you

113
00:04:25.473 --> 00:04:26.703
have to entertain clients?

114
00:04:26.738 --> 00:04:28.375
Don't you have someone
who can do that for you?

115
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.970
- There are certain
things you can't pay

116
00:04:30.005 --> 00:04:31.741
people to do for you. Kelsey.

117
00:04:36.814 --> 00:04:39.782
You'll find that out
once you go to college.

118
00:04:39.817 --> 00:04:41.355
- We still have each other.

119
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.116
- I'm not sure if that's a
good thing or a bad thing.

120
00:04:44.151 --> 00:04:45.689
- Hey. what about me?

121
00:04:45.724 --> 00:04:47.856
- Of course. you!

122
00:04:47.891 --> 00:04:49.594
- Would anyone like
anything to drink?

123
00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:52.696
- I'll take a vod--

124
00:04:52.731 --> 00:04:53.598
soda.

125
00:04:53.633 --> 00:04:54.434
I'll take a soda.

126
00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.962
Thank you.

127
00:05:16.524 --> 00:05:17.523
- You passing out on me?

128
00:05:17.558 --> 00:05:18.491
- No. I'm not.

129
00:05:18.526 --> 00:05:19.756
I'm just resting my eyes.

130
00:05:19.791 --> 00:05:21.593
- How do you expect me
to get through college

131
00:05:21.628 --> 00:05:23.023
with that attitude?

132
00:05:23.058 --> 00:05:25.828
- I intend to actually go to
class. thank you very much.

133
00:05:25.863 --> 00:05:27.093
- That's boring.

134
00:05:27.128 --> 00:05:28.798
- Well. unfortunately.
I have to get a degree

135
00:05:28.833 --> 00:05:30.866
if I want a future.

136
00:05:30.901 --> 00:05:31.966
- So does Kelsey.

137
00:05:32.001 --> 00:05:32.767
- Dad!

138
00:05:32.802 --> 00:05:34.035
- Look. if you
think you're going

139
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.410
to live the rest of your life
on my money. you're mistaken.

140
00:05:36.445 --> 00:05:38.170
You need to be more
like your cousin Sarah.

141
00:05:38.205 --> 00:05:39.908
- Don't worry. Uncle
G. I'll make sure

142
00:05:39.943 --> 00:05:42.779
she goes to all her classes.

143
00:05:42.814 --> 00:05:44.913
- Me too.

144
00:05:44.948 --> 00:05:46.783
- What are you
majoring in. Sarah?

145
00:05:46.818 --> 00:05:48.147
- Journalism.

146
00:05:48.182 --> 00:05:49.048
- Yeah?

147
00:05:49.083 --> 00:05:52.118
We need some honest
journalists again.

148
00:05:52.153 --> 00:05:53.592
Good for you.

149
00:05:53.627 --> 00:05:56.628
- I'm majoring in
journalism. too.

150
00:05:56.663 --> 00:05:57.860
Gonna be a news anchor.

151
00:05:57.895 --> 00:05:59.664
- You actually need
to know what's going

152
00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:01.028
on in the world for that. Alex.

153
00:06:01.063 --> 00:06:03.437
You can't just sit
there and look pretty.

154
00:06:03.472 --> 00:06:06.000
- Oh. but he is pretty!

155
00:06:06.035 --> 00:06:07.166
- They're being mean to me.

156
00:06:07.201 --> 00:06:10.939
- Excuse me. I've
gotta take this.

157
00:06:10.974 --> 00:06:12.842
Yeah. look. that land
has been in my family

158
00:06:12.877 --> 00:06:14.041
for hundreds of years.

159
00:06:14.076 --> 00:06:15.207
I'm not going to tie
it into this deal.

160
00:06:15.242 --> 00:06:16.043
No way.

161
00:06:27.859 --> 00:06:30.090
- Can I get you anything
to drink. James?

162
00:06:30.125 --> 00:06:32.730
- God. I would love a coffee.

163
00:06:32.765 --> 00:06:34.765
It's gonna be a long day.

164
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.569
Franklin has me
working a double shift.

165
00:06:36.604 --> 00:06:37.229
- Look out!

166
00:06:38.738 --> 00:06:40.133
- Shit. hold on!

167
00:07:12.167 --> 00:07:12.869
- Kelsey?

168
00:07:27.556 --> 00:07:28.049
- Sarah?

169
00:07:33.694 --> 00:07:36.662
- Sarah. you're alive!

170
00:07:36.697 --> 00:07:40.193
I pulled everyone else out.
but I think they're all dead.

171
00:07:40.228 --> 00:07:46.001
We're
not alone out here.

172
00:07:46.036 --> 00:07:48.641
There's something else out here.

173
00:07:48.676 --> 00:07:50.841
.

174
00:08:53.873 --> 00:08:54.971
- Hey. Sarah.

175
00:08:55.006 --> 00:08:56.577
How's the Jersey
Devil article coming?

176
00:09:00.407 --> 00:09:02.044
That good. huh?

177
00:09:02.079 --> 00:09:05.685
- It's mostly folklore nonsense.

178
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.721
I can't believe there so little
on Kelsey's disappearance

179
00:09:08.756 --> 00:09:11.119
and what's really
in those woods.

180
00:09:11.154 --> 00:09:14.122
- Are you sure this isn't
too painful for you?

181
00:09:14.157 --> 00:09:16.223
- That's exactly why I
need to write this article.

182
00:09:16.258 --> 00:09:19.633
It's been a year. and no
one wants to talk about it.

183
00:09:19.668 --> 00:09:21.096
The police gave up.

184
00:09:21.131 --> 00:09:22.867
I feel like I need
to do something.

185
00:09:22.902 --> 00:09:25.738
- I know you don't want to
hear this. but as a reporter.

186
00:09:25.773 --> 00:09:28.070
you need to face the
possibility that Kelsey is gone.

187
00:09:28.105 --> 00:09:29.335
- She's alive.

188
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:32.140
I can feel it.

189
00:09:32.175 --> 00:09:35.044
Something is in those woods. and
it's gonna hurt someone else.

190
00:09:37.719 --> 00:09:38.718
- I get it.

191
00:09:38.753 --> 00:09:39.986
I'm just worried. that's all.

192
00:09:40.021 --> 00:09:42.018
I don't think this is healthy.
and I should have never agree.

193
00:09:42.053 --> 00:09:43.283
- Hey. guys. look at this.

194
00:09:46.926 --> 00:09:48.156
Did you know that
there's some kind

195
00:09:48.191 --> 00:09:51.291
of feud between your
family and the Reeds?

196
00:09:51.326 --> 00:09:54.162
And they live within
the Pine Barrens.

197
00:09:54.197 --> 00:09:56.395
- Maybe they know what
happened to Kelsey.

198
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:57.096
- Exactly.

199
00:09:57.131 --> 00:09:59.068
- OK. Sarah. don't even start.

200
00:10:01.809 --> 00:10:04.238
- What if they found out
that Kelsey was a Franklin?

201
00:10:04.273 --> 00:10:08.407
I mean. who knows that these
weirdos would have done.

202
00:10:08.442 --> 00:10:12.312
We should never have
got on that dumb RV.

203
00:10:12.347 --> 00:10:14.116
- OK. I'm pulling this article.

204
00:10:14.151 --> 00:10:16.019
Clearly this is too
much for both of you.

205
00:10:16.054 --> 00:10:17.922
- Maybe we reach out to
local law enforcement

206
00:10:17.957 --> 00:10:19.253
with this information.

207
00:10:19.288 --> 00:10:21.695
- No. a 50-year-old article
about a family feud?

208
00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:23.059
The Jersey Devil?

209
00:10:23.094 --> 00:10:25.061
And how it's all linked to
the possible disappearance

210
00:10:25.096 --> 00:10:26.458
of your cousin?

211
00:10:26.493 --> 00:10:29.230
- They never did find her
body. and I know what I saw.

212
00:10:29.265 --> 00:10:33.168
I know it sounds crazy. but
bad blood never dies. Alex.

213
00:10:33.203 --> 00:10:35.335
- OK. Sarah. you're
talking crazy.

214
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:37.777
You think that your crash
and Kelsey's disappearance

215
00:10:37.812 --> 00:10:40.340
have something to do
with some phony legend

216
00:10:40.375 --> 00:10:43.178
and some ancient.
stupid family feud?

217
00:10:43.213 --> 00:10:45.477
- It's not that crazy.

218
00:10:45.512 --> 00:10:50.086
Anyways. I just thought it'd be
good research for the article.

219
00:10:50.121 --> 00:10:51.087
- Did you not hear me?

220
00:10:51.122 --> 00:10:52.220
I'm pulling the story.

221
00:10:52.255 --> 00:10:55.487
- Max. we can handle this!

222
00:10:55.522 --> 00:11:00.063
- Fine. but under no
circumstances do you guys go

223
00:11:00.098 --> 00:11:00.965
into those woods.

224
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:01.834
- But if I can--

225
00:11:01.869 --> 00:11:03.165
- Sarah. promise me.

226
00:11:07.435 --> 00:11:10.205
- I promise.

227
00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:14.110
- OK. Alex. I think you have
your own assignment to work on.

228
00:11:14.145 --> 00:11:15.914
- All right. copy that.

229
00:11:39.302 --> 00:11:40.433
- You still here?

230
00:11:40.468 --> 00:11:42.237
- It's all on this
Jersey Devil thing.

231
00:11:55.186 --> 00:11:58.154
- What's going on?

232
00:11:58.189 --> 00:12:02.521
- It just took her. that thing.

233
00:12:06.131 --> 00:12:10.199
- I was there. remember?

234
00:12:10.234 --> 00:12:12.102
You had a concussion.

235
00:12:12.137 --> 00:12:14.269
But Sarah. we've
talked about this.

236
00:12:14.304 --> 00:12:15.842
It could have been an animal.

237
00:12:15.877 --> 00:12:16.403
- No way.

238
00:12:21.476 --> 00:12:22.112
- You're stuck.

239
00:12:22.147 --> 00:12:23.146
- How?

240
00:12:23.181 --> 00:12:24.312
- Well. let's take a look at it.

241
00:12:24.347 --> 00:12:25.577
I mean. this story
we're working on.

242
00:12:25.612 --> 00:12:28.822
it doesn't exactly have
an ending now. does it?

243
00:12:28.857 --> 00:12:32.958
- I know what I saw. and
I know how crazy I sound.

244
00:12:32.993 --> 00:12:37.589
- As journalists. there's a lot
of things we just can't prove.

245
00:12:37.624 --> 00:12:38.931
- Kelsey survived.

246
00:12:38.966 --> 00:12:39.899
I know she did.

247
00:12:44.466 --> 00:12:47.566
- I don't know what that means.

248
00:12:47.601 --> 00:12:52.604
All I know is that sometimes.
people can manifest a tragedy

249
00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:53.104
to help them cope.

250
00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:54.474
And I don't know.

251
00:12:54.509 --> 00:12:57.081
Maybe this is just
your way of coping.

252
00:12:57.116 --> 00:12:57.576
- Maybe.

253
00:13:01.549 --> 00:13:04.253
- So what are we
going to do about it?

254
00:13:04.288 --> 00:13:05.320
- Finish the story.

255
00:13:23.208 --> 00:13:25.241
- That's the last thing
she ever texted me.

256
00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:34.415
Still haven't deleted it.

257
00:13:37.024 --> 00:13:38.023
I probably never will.

258
00:13:42.392 --> 00:13:45.294
- I need to find out
what happened to her.

259
00:13:45.329 --> 00:13:46.999
- They ran search
parties for months

260
00:13:47.034 --> 00:13:48.462
and. they never found her body.

261
00:13:48.497 --> 00:13:51.498
If dozens of people with dogs.
cops couldn't find her body.

262
00:13:51.533 --> 00:13:54.171
what makes you think
that you can't?

263
00:13:54.206 --> 00:13:55.667
- I know what I saw.

264
00:13:55.702 --> 00:13:57.570
It might bring
closure to the story.

265
00:14:02.643 --> 00:14:04.478
- Fine.

266
00:14:04.513 --> 00:14:06.348
But this isn't just
about the story. then.

267
00:14:06.383 --> 00:14:07.646
- It never was.

268
00:14:07.681 --> 00:14:10.022
It's about finding out
what happened to Kelsey.

269
00:14:16.459 --> 00:14:17.425
- I'm going with you.

270
00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:18.998
- I don't need a babysitter.

271
00:14:19.033 --> 00:14:20.362
I have to do this on my own.

272
00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:24.971
- Well. call me.

273
00:14:25.006 --> 00:14:25.598
Keep me updated.

274
00:14:36.677 --> 00:14:38.149
- You're still here.

275
00:14:38.184 --> 00:14:39.084
- How's it going. Max.

276
00:14:39.119 --> 00:14:40.316
I was just finishing up.

277
00:14:43.024 --> 00:14:44.716
- I just saw Sarah walk past.

278
00:14:44.751 --> 00:14:45.651
She doing OK?

279
00:14:49.261 --> 00:14:52.427
- Yeah. yeah.

280
00:14:52.462 --> 00:14:55.067
- Alex. what's up?

281
00:14:55.102 --> 00:14:56.200
- Nothing.

282
00:14:56.235 --> 00:14:57.333
I'll see you tomorrow.

283
00:15:03.506 --> 00:15:05.011
- Don't get yourselves killed.

284
00:15:21.491 --> 00:15:23.062
ALEX
Are you there yet?

285
00:15:23.097 --> 00:15:25.625
- Yeah I just got to Devil's
Cafe out on Reed's Point.

286
00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.298
Don't tell Max. but I
just spoke to the owner.

287
00:15:28.333 --> 00:15:30.102
She said she might
know something.

288
00:15:30.137 --> 00:15:31.334
- Well. that's a good start.

289
00:15:31.369 --> 00:15:32.731
Did she say anything
about the Jersey Devil?

290
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.208
- Kind of laughed at
me when I mentioned it.

291
00:15:37.243 --> 00:15:38.341
Are you following me?

292
00:15:38.376 --> 00:15:40.541
- I didn't want
you to come alone.

293
00:15:40.576 --> 00:15:42.246
I can't believe you
drove all night.

294
00:15:42.281 --> 00:15:43.280
- Alex!

295
00:15:43.315 --> 00:15:44.380
- Sorry.

296
00:15:44.415 --> 00:15:45.645
- Way to be a creeper!

297
00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.185
- Don't go
looking for the Devil!

298
00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:48.384
Because he knows. he knows.

299
00:15:48.419 --> 00:15:49.253
He's here.

300
00:15:49.288 --> 00:15:50.122
He's gonna find ya!

301
00:15:50.157 --> 00:15:51.387
I ain't afraid!

302
00:15:51.422 --> 00:15:54.786
No. I ain't afraid!

303
00:15:54.821 --> 00:15:55.655
You been warned!

304
00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:56.089
You been warned!

305
00:15:56.124 --> 00:15:57.558
You been warned!

306
00:16:10.375 --> 00:16:12.606
- OK. so what's the plan?

307
00:16:16.612 --> 00:16:20.680
What. exactly. are
you trying to find?

308
00:16:20.715 --> 00:16:22.187
- I don't know.

309
00:16:22.222 --> 00:16:24.420
Maybe this is a stupid idea.

310
00:16:24.455 --> 00:16:26.422
- Well. we're here. so--

311
00:16:26.457 --> 00:16:27.654
- Let me get that for you.

312
00:16:32.694 --> 00:16:34.199
You the kids that called?

313
00:16:34.234 --> 00:16:36.564
- Yeah. Sarah Franklin.

314
00:16:36.599 --> 00:16:38.071
- Well. Beth's in the back.

315
00:16:38.106 --> 00:16:39.732
I'm not sure I can be
of much help to you.

316
00:16:39.767 --> 00:16:42.207
- I'm doing a report
from my college paper.

317
00:16:42.242 --> 00:16:44.374
Mind if I ask you
a few questions?

318
00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.609
- I-- don't bother me much.

319
00:16:48.644 --> 00:16:50.446
- What I'm looking
for is any information

320
00:16:50.481 --> 00:16:52.646
on that big RV crash
from last year.

321
00:16:52.681 --> 00:16:54.846
from a local's perspective.

322
00:16:54.881 --> 00:16:57.354
- Talking about that trailer
that went up in flames?

323
00:16:57.389 --> 00:16:59.356
People got killed.
girl gone missing?

324
00:16:59.391 --> 00:17:00.456
- Yeah. that one.

325
00:17:00.491 --> 00:17:02.194
- I don't know much about it.

326
00:17:02.229 --> 00:17:03.426
Sheriff did a search party.

327
00:17:03.461 --> 00:17:04.559
Nothing turned up.

328
00:17:04.594 --> 00:17:06.231
- Any idea what happened to her?

329
00:17:06.266 --> 00:17:07.496
- No idea.

330
00:17:07.531 --> 00:17:09.531
Animals got her.

331
00:17:09.566 --> 00:17:11.599
Look. between you
and me. I don't even

332
00:17:11.634 --> 00:17:13.172
think she was in the vehicle.

333
00:17:13.207 --> 00:17:14.701
- She totally was!

334
00:17:14.736 --> 00:17:16.406
- Excuse me?

335
00:17:16.441 --> 00:17:17.110
- Nothing.

336
00:17:19.642 --> 00:17:24.612
- Well. I'm pretty busy. so
sorry I can't be more helpful.

337
00:17:24.647 --> 00:17:27.120
- You know anyone who can
take us into those woods?

338
00:17:29.685 --> 00:17:32.356
- You two kids aren't trying
to track down the Jersey Devil.

339
00:17:32.391 --> 00:17:33.852
are you?

340
00:17:33.887 --> 00:17:35.755
Because we get so many people
in here looking for that thing.

341
00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:36.456
- Is it real?

342
00:17:36.491 --> 00:17:37.523
- I've lived here my whole life.

343
00:17:37.559 --> 00:17:41.497
Only people ever seen it
are tourists and crazies.

344
00:17:41.532 --> 00:17:45.567
This damn place
is called The Devil's Cafe.

345
00:17:45.602 --> 00:17:48.207
But no. Jersey Devil ain't real.

346
00:17:48.242 --> 00:17:49.241
- We're not saying it is.

347
00:17:49.276 --> 00:17:51.474
We just wanna head to the site.

348
00:17:51.509 --> 00:17:54.378
- And why would
you wanna go there?

349
00:17:54.413 --> 00:17:56.611
- Because we were
in the accident too.

350
00:17:56.646 --> 00:17:58.547
and we want to
see for ourselves.

351
00:18:01.321 --> 00:18:02.386
- I see.

352
00:18:02.421 --> 00:18:04.916
- We really want some closure.

353
00:18:04.951 --> 00:18:09.690
- Look. I might not know much.
but sometimes it's better

354
00:18:09.725 --> 00:18:12.660
to just let those things lie.

355
00:18:12.695 --> 00:18:14.662
That's my advice to you.

356
00:18:14.697 --> 00:18:15.927
- I think she's right.

357
00:18:15.962 --> 00:18:18.336
- If you know anyone who
might know those words.

358
00:18:18.371 --> 00:18:19.469
that would be helpful.

359
00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.474
- My shift's ending.

360
00:18:24.509 --> 00:18:26.179
Sorry I can't help.

361
00:18:32.484 --> 00:18:33.549
That's your second refill.

362
00:18:33.584 --> 00:18:34.517
You're gonna have
to pay for this.

363
00:18:34.552 --> 00:18:35.749
Late one was on the house.

364
00:18:41.592 --> 00:18:43.295
- Well. maybe we should bail.

365
00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:44.626
- Maybe this was a big waste.

366
00:18:49.732 --> 00:18:51.435
- You kids want
some more coffee?

367
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:53.734
- Just the check. thank you.

368
00:18:53.769 --> 00:18:55.604
- Carla told me there
were some kids asking

369
00:18:55.639 --> 00:18:56.638
about going to the woods.

370
00:18:56.673 --> 00:18:57.870
Is that you two?

371
00:18:57.905 --> 00:18:58.370
- Yeah. why?

372
00:18:58.406 --> 00:18:59.806
You know someone?

373
00:18:59.841 --> 00:19:01.808
- If anybody knows
these woods. it's Hank.

374
00:19:01.843 --> 00:19:03.975
And he's probably done
with his last tour.

375
00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:05.878
He can take you
where you want to go.

376
00:19:10.324 --> 00:19:12.720
- You want to go into those
woods with a complete stranger?

377
00:19:12.755 --> 00:19:14.260
- I'll be with you.

378
00:19:14.295 --> 00:19:15.360
I'm sure you can protect me.

379
00:19:15.395 --> 00:19:16.625
- Is that sarcasm?

380
00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:18.297
- Yes. it's sarcasm. Alex.

381
00:19:23.766 --> 00:19:24.897
- I
think that's him.

382
00:19:24.932 --> 00:19:25.531
- Hi.

383
00:19:25.566 --> 00:19:26.998
- Don't look!

384
00:19:27.033 --> 00:19:27.669
- Why?

385
00:19:27.704 --> 00:19:28.472
- I don't know.

386
00:19:28.507 --> 00:19:29.407
Just don't look.

387
00:19:29.442 --> 00:19:30.474
- Who'd you call about?

388
00:19:30.509 --> 00:19:32.641
- Kids are over there.

389
00:19:45.293 --> 00:19:49.295
- You kids looking for somebody
to take you into the woods?

390
00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:51.561
- Maybe.

391
00:19:51.596 --> 00:19:53.761
- Well. Beth called me.

392
00:19:53.796 --> 00:19:55.796
She said someone needed
a guide to take them

393
00:19:55.831 --> 00:19:57.303
into the Pine Barrens.

394
00:19:57.338 --> 00:20:01.032
- You know about that
big RV crash last year?

395
00:20:01.067 --> 00:20:01.733
- Yeah.

396
00:20:01.768 --> 00:20:03.342
- You know where it happened?

397
00:20:03.377 --> 00:20:06.477
- They've closed that
road now. you know.

398
00:20:06.512 --> 00:20:07.940
- That's where we want to go.

399
00:20:11.352 --> 00:20:12.582
- Well. you're in luck.

400
00:20:12.617 --> 00:20:14.386
It's a short drive. and
then a 30-minute hike

401
00:20:14.421 --> 00:20:15.486
to that side of the highway.

402
00:20:15.521 --> 00:20:17.917
- Can you take us?

403
00:20:17.952 --> 00:20:19.622
- It depends.

404
00:20:19.657 --> 00:20:22.790
How much you got?

405
00:20:22.825 --> 00:20:24.396
- 200 is all I got.

406
00:20:24.431 --> 00:20:24.891
- Sure.

407
00:20:36.938 --> 00:20:41.072
You pay for my BLT. I'm
gonna take that to go.

408
00:20:41.107 --> 00:20:42.315
You can follow me.

409
00:20:45.353 --> 00:20:46.418
- Fresh blood.

410
00:20:46.453 --> 00:20:47.419
He's gonna love you!

411
00:20:47.454 --> 00:20:48.420
- Hey!

412
00:20:52.987 --> 00:20:54.492
- Scram!

413
00:20:54.527 --> 00:20:55.394
Come on. andale!

414
00:20:55.429 --> 00:20:56.593
Let's go!

415
00:20:56.628 --> 00:20:57.891
Get back. let's go!

416
00:21:01.732 --> 00:21:02.434
That's Steve.

417
00:21:03.899 --> 00:21:07.032
He's a little touched.

418
00:21:07.067 --> 00:21:07.901
You two ready?

419
00:21:10.939 --> 00:21:11.575
Follow me.

420
00:21:20.146 --> 00:21:22.487
- I still don't have a
good feeling about this.

421
00:21:24.887 --> 00:21:26.359
- He looks nice enough.

422
00:21:32.092 --> 00:21:34.367
- You ready?

423
00:21:34.402 --> 00:21:35.533
- Yeah.

424
00:21:35.568 --> 00:21:37.128
- Let's go.

425
00:21:37.163 --> 00:21:37.931
- Yes. sir.

426
00:22:03.695 --> 00:22:06.025
- Hey. Max. just a heads up.

427
00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:09.402
I'm following Sarah out to the
Devil's Cafe on Reed's Point.

428
00:22:09.437 --> 00:22:10.667
I've been driving all night.

429
00:22:10.702 --> 00:22:12.471
Please don't be mad.

430
00:22:12.506 --> 00:22:13.472
I mean. you know Sarah.

431
00:22:13.507 --> 00:22:14.706
She just wants answers. OK?

432
00:22:14.742 --> 00:22:17.443
So listen I'll send you a text
later when we're on our way

433
00:22:17.478 --> 00:22:18.609
back.

434
00:22:18.644 --> 00:22:19.104
Bye.

435
00:22:34.825 --> 00:22:35.824
- Come on. Alex!

436
00:22:37.597 --> 00:22:40.059
ALEX
Hey. this is Alex Williams.

437
00:22:40.094 --> 00:22:40.763
Sorry--

438
00:22:48.905 --> 00:22:50.806
SARAH Hi. this is Sarah.

439
00:22:50.841 --> 00:22:54.205
Please leave a message.

440
00:23:12.093 --> 00:23:13.598
CARLA Devil's Cafe.

441
00:23:13.633 --> 00:23:14.698
Carla speaking.

442
00:23:14.733 --> 00:23:15.897
- Hi.

443
00:23:15.932 --> 00:23:17.195
I'm trying to get a
hold of my friends

444
00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:20.704
who said that they
would be at your cafe.

445
00:23:20.739 --> 00:23:22.871
CARLA I
really can't help you.

446
00:23:22.906 --> 00:23:24.103
- I'm worried about them.

447
00:23:24.138 --> 00:23:26.908
I haven't been able
to get a hold of them.

448
00:23:26.943 --> 00:23:29.911
One of them is a girl.
and she has short hair.

449
00:23:29.946 --> 00:23:32.881
The other's tall
and has long hair.

450
00:23:32.916 --> 00:23:37.248
Have you seen two college
kids by that description?

451
00:23:37.283 --> 00:23:40.152
CARLA Oh. yeah.
they left a little while ago.

452
00:23:40.187 --> 00:23:41.923
Said they wanted to
see the closed road

453
00:23:41.958 --> 00:23:43.254
where that RV crash happened.

454
00:23:43.289 --> 00:23:45.597
- Oh. OK.

455
00:23:45.632 --> 00:23:47.797
Which road is that. exactly?

456
00:23:47.832 --> 00:23:49.964
CARLA
It's Pine Creek Road.

457
00:23:49.999 --> 00:23:52.164
right near Route 561.

458
00:23:52.199 --> 00:23:53.704
- OK. thank you.

459
00:23:53.739 --> 00:23:54.903
CARLA Mm-hmm.

460
00:24:08.083 --> 00:24:10.754
- You were in that
RV that crashed. huh?

461
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:12.822
- We both were.

462
00:24:12.857 --> 00:24:17.926
- You must have a lot of guilt
being the only two survivors.

463
00:24:17.961 --> 00:24:21.226
- Well. they didn't
find my cousin. so--

464
00:24:21.261 --> 00:24:22.535
- What do you mean?

465
00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:25.769
- I mean she disappeared.

466
00:24:25.804 --> 00:24:27.540
- Disappeared. how?

467
00:24:27.575 --> 00:24:28.838
- I don't know.

468
00:24:28.873 --> 00:24:32.006
All I know is that
something dragged her away.

469
00:24:32.041 --> 00:24:33.304
- You didn't tell me that.

470
00:24:33.339 --> 00:24:35.075
- You didn't ask.

471
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:37.044
- OK. we gotta go back.

472
00:24:37.079 --> 00:24:37.649
Come on!

473
00:24:37.684 --> 00:24:38.947
- Why?

474
00:24:38.982 --> 00:24:40.619
- Listen. because you two
are chasing the Devil.

475
00:24:40.654 --> 00:24:42.049
- We're just trying to find
out what happened to my cousin.

476
00:24:42.084 --> 00:24:43.314
- Are you talking
about the Jersey Devil?

477
00:24:43.349 --> 00:24:44.018
- Shh!

478
00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:49.892
Things go on in these woods
that will put the fear of God

479
00:24:49.927 --> 00:24:50.662
in you.

480
00:24:53.733 --> 00:24:55.634
- Bullshit.

481
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:59.066
- I'm just kidding.

482
00:24:59.101 --> 00:25:02.333
I do that to everybody
I bring out here.

483
00:25:02.368 --> 00:25:03.103
It's fun.

484
00:25:03.138 --> 00:25:04.335
Come on!

485
00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:06.337
I mean. I want you to
get your money's worth.

486
00:25:06.372 --> 00:25:09.615
That's why people come up here.
is to get the crap scared out

487
00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:10.847
of them.

488
00:25:10.882 --> 00:25:11.914
- Do you even know where
the crash happened?

489
00:25:11.949 --> 00:25:13.179
- Yeah. it's right up here.

490
00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:19.592
- Come on.

491
00:25:43.277 --> 00:25:45.882
- So what's the story about
the Jersey Devil. anyway?

492
00:25:45.917 --> 00:25:48.049
- Well. there's
been lots of them.

493
00:25:48.084 --> 00:25:50.986
Most of 'em go back
to the Reed family.

494
00:25:51.021 --> 00:25:52.823
- The who?

495
00:25:52.858 --> 00:25:54.220
- The Reeds.

496
00:25:54.255 --> 00:25:56.662
The story goes.
they had 12 kids.

497
00:25:56.697 --> 00:26:00.226
When she got pregnant with a
13th. she cursed it. right?

498
00:26:00.261 --> 00:26:03.031
She didn't want to
have another kid.

499
00:26:03.066 --> 00:26:05.968
When it was born. it had
hooves like a deer. big claws

500
00:26:06.003 --> 00:26:09.741
for hands. forked tail.

501
00:26:09.776 --> 00:26:12.271
Father took it out in
the woods to bury it.

502
00:26:12.306 --> 00:26:15.978
The creature killed
him. and then went back

503
00:26:16.013 --> 00:26:17.716
and killed everybody else.

504
00:26:20.952 --> 00:26:22.083
Then. there's the feud.

505
00:26:37.034 --> 00:26:39.430
- You OK?

506
00:26:39.465 --> 00:26:43.005
- Yeah. never mind.

507
00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:43.775
- Hey.

508
00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:44.435
- Come on!

509
00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:45.007
We're right up here.

510
00:26:52.115 --> 00:26:54.951
All right. this is my rest spot.

511
00:26:54.986 --> 00:26:55.919
- We're stopping?

512
00:26:55.954 --> 00:26:58.757
- Take a rest.

513
00:26:58.792 --> 00:27:00.825
- Maybe this wasn't a good idea.

514
00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:02.255
- You're probably right.

515
00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:04.026
- I thought he said
that we were close.

516
00:27:04.061 --> 00:27:05.390
I don't understand
why we're stopping.

517
00:27:05.425 --> 00:27:09.064
- You know. when that RV
blew up. that was a big deal.

518
00:27:09.099 --> 00:27:11.363
The entire town was out here
looking for your friend.

519
00:27:11.398 --> 00:27:12.100
- My cousin.

520
00:27:14.775 --> 00:27:18.370
- Hey. what do you
think happened to her?

521
00:27:18.405 --> 00:27:19.173
- I don't know.

522
00:27:21.914 --> 00:27:24.310
It's tough to say.

523
00:27:24.345 --> 00:27:29.216
Well. maybe it
was the Devil himself.

524
00:27:29.251 --> 00:27:30.723
Hence. the Jersey Devil.

525
00:27:30.758 --> 00:27:32.021
- You believe in that?

526
00:27:32.056 --> 00:27:35.794
- I don't not believe in it.

527
00:27:35.829 --> 00:27:37.994
You know. you spend enough
time in these woods.

528
00:27:38.029 --> 00:27:40.062
and you see a lot
of strange things.

529
00:27:40.097 --> 00:27:41.063
- Here we go again.

530
00:27:41.098 --> 00:27:43.131
Can we just get to the site?

531
00:27:43.166 --> 00:27:45.870
- All right. let's go.

532
00:28:28.574 --> 00:28:30.849
- It's fresh blood.

533
00:28:30.884 --> 00:28:31.850
Did you do this?

534
00:28:31.885 --> 00:28:33.247
- This is probably hunters.

535
00:28:33.282 --> 00:28:35.414
They hung their kill up to
come back and get it later.

536
00:28:35.449 --> 00:28:36.115
- No.

537
00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:37.449
No. this is not hunters here.

538
00:28:37.484 --> 00:28:39.891
I'm telling you. I
got a bad feeling.

539
00:28:39.926 --> 00:28:41.024
- We should go.

540
00:28:44.326 --> 00:28:46.898
- Look. it's not a bad idea.

541
00:28:46.933 --> 00:28:47.800
- We gotta go.

542
00:28:47.835 --> 00:28:48.801
Please. can we just go?

543
00:28:48.836 --> 00:28:49.560
- Alex. slow down!

544
00:28:49.595 --> 00:28:51.265
Your bad leg!

545
00:29:10.924 --> 00:29:12.121
- Help us!

546
00:29:12.156 --> 00:29:13.056
- OK. hold on.

547
00:29:13.091 --> 00:29:15.256
- Sarah. I'm stuck.

548
00:29:15.291 --> 00:29:17.995
- Oh. Christ.

549
00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:20.327
- Oh my god. I can't look.

550
00:29:20.362 --> 00:29:23.869
- All right. well. then
don't look. all right?

551
00:29:23.904 --> 00:29:27.004
Boy. you got yourself
in a pickle here. kid.

552
00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:28.038
Just breathe.

553
00:29:28.073 --> 00:29:30.337
Kid. don't look at it. breathe.

554
00:29:30.372 --> 00:29:33.142
Let me see here if I can--

555
00:29:33.177 --> 00:29:33.846
ready?

556
00:29:33.881 --> 00:29:34.572
- Yeah.

557
00:29:34.607 --> 00:29:37.476
- One. two. three.

558
00:29:42.615 --> 00:29:43.080
- Don't look!

559
00:29:43.116 --> 00:29:44.417
OK. just hold on.

560
00:29:44.452 --> 00:29:45.616
You got your leg
stuck in this thing.

561
00:29:45.651 --> 00:29:47.354
I don't know how.
but you're stuck.

562
00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:49.224
- It's killing me.
Sarah. it's killing me.

563
00:29:49.259 --> 00:29:50.159
- We're trying.

564
00:29:52.229 --> 00:29:53.228
We have to get it off him.

565
00:29:53.263 --> 00:29:54.064
- I can't.

566
00:29:54.099 --> 00:29:55.395
I need a saw.

567
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:57.199
I have one in the truck.

568
00:29:57.234 --> 00:29:58.233
- Crap.

569
00:29:58.268 --> 00:30:01.071
- Hey. I'm a hunter. kiddo.

570
00:30:01.106 --> 00:30:04.877
I use the saw to trap wolves and
for situations just like this.

571
00:30:04.912 --> 00:30:05.438
- Both?

572
00:30:05.473 --> 00:30:06.472
- Yes!

573
00:30:06.507 --> 00:30:08.111
I'm gonna go back to the truck.

574
00:30:08.146 --> 00:30:09.882
Shouldn't take me
more than 30 minutes.

575
00:30:09.917 --> 00:30:10.883
I'll be back by dark.

576
00:30:10.918 --> 00:30:11.510
- Wait. by dark?

577
00:30:11.545 --> 00:30:12.144
- Yeah.

578
00:30:12.179 --> 00:30:14.480
- You can't leave us here!

579
00:30:14.515 --> 00:30:18.187
- Listen. it's either that.
or we stay here all night

580
00:30:18.222 --> 00:30:20.057
and go back and get it
in the morning. which

581
00:30:20.092 --> 00:30:22.290
I don't recommend.

582
00:30:22.325 --> 00:30:23.654
- You should go.

583
00:30:23.689 --> 00:30:27.196
You're gonna wanna tie that
off. slow the bleeding.

584
00:30:27.231 --> 00:30:29.561
Animals are gonna
smell the blood.

585
00:30:29.596 --> 00:30:30.903
- Great.

586
00:30:30.938 --> 00:30:31.563
- All right.

587
00:30:31.598 --> 00:30:32.364
- Hurry back.

588
00:30:32.399 --> 00:30:34.335
- I'll be back as
quick as I can.

589
00:30:45.986 --> 00:30:50.549
I did not see
today ending like this.

590
00:30:50.584 --> 00:31:00.427
OK. I'm supposed to take this
off. and tie it around my leg

591
00:31:00.462 --> 00:31:02.330
to stop the bleeding.

592
00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:07.698
OK.

593
00:31:07.733 --> 00:31:08.435
- Right.

594
00:31:10.637 --> 00:31:12.439
- I gotta tie this
around my leg. OK?

595
00:31:12.474 --> 00:31:13.572
We've gotta tie it tight. OK?

596
00:31:13.607 --> 00:31:15.279
We've gotta stop the bleeding.

597
00:31:19.151 --> 00:31:21.283
Take this.

598
00:31:21.318 --> 00:31:23.285
You ready?

599
00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.716
It's gotta be tight.

600
00:31:25.751 --> 00:31:28.554
OK. one. two. three.

601
00:31:43.109 --> 00:31:44.042
- How are you feeling?

602
00:31:47.245 --> 00:31:47.947
- Like crap.

603
00:31:56.056 --> 00:31:58.353
I miss her.

604
00:31:58.388 --> 00:32:03.963
- So do I. She'd be here
today if it wasn't for me.

605
00:32:07.265 --> 00:32:08.363
- You can't blame yourself.

606
00:32:08.398 --> 00:32:10.233
- I didn't wanna drive my car.

607
00:32:10.268 --> 00:32:12.037
- You didn't crash that RV.

608
00:32:12.072 --> 00:32:13.368
- But I was the one pushing her.

609
00:32:13.403 --> 00:32:17.768
- Hey. don't do that!

610
00:32:17.803 --> 00:32:22.014
Kelsey was lucky to have you as
a cousin and as a best friend.

611
00:32:25.118 --> 00:32:25.611
We both are.

612
00:32:28.187 --> 00:32:30.055
- She's alive.

613
00:32:32.257 --> 00:32:33.487
- What the hell is that?

614
00:32:38.263 --> 00:32:41.033
- No idea.

615
00:32:41.068 --> 00:32:42.166
- He left over an hour ago.

616
00:32:45.567 --> 00:32:47.501
- He should
be back any minute.

617
00:32:59.746 --> 00:33:01.482
- I don't think
he's coming back.

618
00:33:01.517 --> 00:33:03.220
- I don't think so either.

619
00:33:03.255 --> 00:33:04.452
- I'm gonna go
and look for help.

620
00:33:04.487 --> 00:33:05.816
- Well. you think
it's a good idea?

621
00:33:05.851 --> 00:33:07.752
- It's either that or
sitting here doing nothing.

622
00:33:07.787 --> 00:33:08.453
- I know. but what--

623
00:33:08.488 --> 00:33:09.754
I mean. what if you get lost?

624
00:33:09.789 --> 00:33:11.657
- If I keep that
ridge line in sight.

625
00:33:11.692 --> 00:33:13.395
I should make it
back to the car.

626
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:14.330
- I don't know.

627
00:33:14.365 --> 00:33:15.265
I'll

628
00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:16.464
- Trace our path back.

629
00:33:16.499 --> 00:33:17.795
It's not like we have
much choice. Alex.

630
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:19.599
- I know. but I don't
want you going out alone.

631
00:33:19.634 --> 00:33:21.568
- I don't see any
other option. do you?

632
00:33:21.603 --> 00:33:23.174
- You're hurt pretty bad.

633
00:33:23.209 --> 00:33:27.079
If I don't get help soon.
your leg could get worse.

634
00:33:27.114 --> 00:33:29.444
I'll be as quick as I can.

635
00:33:29.479 --> 00:33:32.579
- OK. I trust you.

636
00:33:45.363 --> 00:33:46.329
- Be careful.

637
00:33:46.364 --> 00:33:46.824
- I will.

638
00:34:15.426 --> 00:34:17.789
God. I hope I'm not next.

639
00:34:49.922 --> 00:34:51.196
- Great. no service!

640
00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:04.902
What are you doing here?

641
00:35:09.975 --> 00:35:10.875
Alex!

642
00:35:18.753 --> 00:35:19.290
Sarah!

643
00:37:08.995 --> 00:37:11.798
- Can I help you?

644
00:37:11.833 --> 00:37:13.767
Sorry. I don't get a
lot of visitors here.

645
00:37:13.802 --> 00:37:17.375
- Sorry to bother you. but
my friend. he's injured.

646
00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:18.673
- OK.

647
00:37:18.708 --> 00:37:19.773
- The guy taking us into
the woods went to get help

648
00:37:19.808 --> 00:37:20.741
and never came back.

649
00:37:20.776 --> 00:37:21.940
- What was his name?

650
00:37:21.975 --> 00:37:22.809
- Hank.

651
00:37:22.844 --> 00:37:24.943
I didn't get a last name.

652
00:37:24.978 --> 00:37:25.443
- Hank?

653
00:37:25.479 --> 00:37:27.011
- Do you know him?

654
00:37:27.046 --> 00:37:28.145
- No.

655
00:37:28.181 --> 00:37:29.783
Pretty much everybody in
these woods knows each other.

656
00:37:29.818 --> 00:37:30.652
but I've never heard
of a Hank before.

657
00:37:30.687 --> 00:37:32.357
- I need help.

658
00:37:32.392 --> 00:37:33.017
- No problem.

659
00:37:33.052 --> 00:37:34.085
Just come inside.

660
00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:35.426
We'll call the Sheriff.
and they'll send somebody

661
00:37:35.461 --> 00:37:35.987
to look for him. OK?

662
00:37:55.679 --> 00:37:56.942
- Hey!

663
00:37:56.977 --> 00:37:57.743
- Hey!

664
00:37:57.778 --> 00:37:59.648
Oh my god. I
thought you left us!

665
00:37:59.683 --> 00:38:01.518
- Sorry.

666
00:38:01.553 --> 00:38:04.719
I got a little turned around.

667
00:38:04.754 --> 00:38:06.556
These woods will do
that to you. no matter

668
00:38:06.591 --> 00:38:10.494
how long you've been in 'em.

669
00:38:10.529 --> 00:38:11.429
Where is Sarah?

670
00:38:11.464 --> 00:38:12.122
- She went to find you.

671
00:38:12.157 --> 00:38:13.398
Did you see her?

672
00:38:13.433 --> 00:38:15.092
- Oh my god. no!

673
00:38:15.127 --> 00:38:15.759
- Oh. shit!

674
00:38:15.795 --> 00:38:17.127
- Let's get you out of here.

675
00:38:17.162 --> 00:38:18.601
Take the flashlight
for me. would you?

676
00:38:18.636 --> 00:38:20.669
- Yeah.

677
00:38:20.704 --> 00:38:23.067
- OK. brace yourself.

678
00:38:23.102 --> 00:38:24.101
Here we go.

679
00:38:33.618 --> 00:38:36.487
- Oh!

680
00:38:37.622 --> 00:38:38.522
- Be careful.

681
00:38:38.557 --> 00:38:40.018
- OK.

682
00:38:40.053 --> 00:38:47.762
Oh. all right. now
we just have to find Sarah.

683
00:38:47.797 --> 00:38:49.599
- Well. we're not
doing anything tonight.

684
00:38:49.634 --> 00:38:50.160
Take this.

685
00:38:50.195 --> 00:38:51.228
Take this.

686
00:38:51.263 --> 00:38:52.767
- Yeah. but she's here. so
we should just find her.

687
00:38:52.802 --> 00:38:54.131
- We will find her
in the morning.

688
00:38:54.166 --> 00:38:57.035
Right now. we're
getting out of here.

689
00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:58.036
Keep hoppin'.

690
00:38:58.071 --> 00:38:59.774
- Yeah.

691
00:38:59.809 --> 00:39:01.809
Oh. yeah.

692
00:39:01.844 --> 00:39:02.645
Are you ready?

693
00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:03.514
- OK. let's go.

694
00:39:03.549 --> 00:39:04.614
- Yeah. let's go.

695
00:39:04.649 --> 00:39:06.913
- OK.

696
00:39:06.948 --> 00:39:13.051
- Yeah. Sheriff. his name is
Alex Williams. 6'1". long hair.

697
00:39:13.086 --> 00:39:16.560
Yeah. his leg's
busted up real bad.

698
00:39:16.595 --> 00:39:18.155
OK. yeah.

699
00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:19.057
Thank you. Sheriff.

700
00:39:21.699 --> 00:39:23.534
OK. how are you feeling?

701
00:39:23.569 --> 00:39:25.063
Any better?

702
00:39:25.098 --> 00:39:26.097
- Thanks.

703
00:39:26.133 --> 00:39:28.198
- They're gonna send
somebody to look for him.

704
00:39:28.233 --> 00:39:30.068
They'll find him.

705
00:39:30.103 --> 00:39:33.511
- Last year. there was
an RV crash in the woods.

706
00:39:33.546 --> 00:39:34.512
- Yeah. I remember that.

707
00:39:34.547 --> 00:39:36.877
I thought everybody died.

708
00:39:36.912 --> 00:39:37.779
- I survived.

709
00:39:42.115 --> 00:39:44.456
- So if you don't
mind me asking.

710
00:39:44.491 --> 00:39:45.787
what brings you back here?

711
00:39:45.822 --> 00:39:47.921
- I'm doing an article
for my college newspaper.

712
00:39:47.956 --> 00:39:49.791
I'm looking for
answers to questions

713
00:39:49.826 --> 00:39:51.463
I can't seem to figure out.

714
00:39:51.498 --> 00:39:54.697
My cousin Kelsey was also
in the crash with me.

715
00:39:54.732 --> 00:39:55.632
- No. I remember this.

716
00:39:55.667 --> 00:39:56.666
There was a huge search.

717
00:39:56.701 --> 00:39:59.196
But they never found her. right?

718
00:39:59.231 --> 00:40:01.638
Oh. hey. Sarah. you don't
have to talk about this

719
00:40:01.673 --> 00:40:04.641
if you don't want to.

720
00:40:04.676 --> 00:40:06.709
- No. it's OK.

721
00:40:06.744 --> 00:40:10.977
They never found her body. but I
think she might still be alive.

722
00:40:11.012 --> 00:40:13.848
- What makes you think
she's still alive?

723
00:40:13.883 --> 00:40:15.113
- I don't know.

724
00:40:15.148 --> 00:40:19.216
I just saw something
that dragged her away.

725
00:40:19.251 --> 00:40:21.493
- Jersey Devil.

726
00:40:21.528 --> 00:40:22.659
- Crazy. right?

727
00:40:22.694 --> 00:40:24.122
- No. no.

728
00:40:24.157 --> 00:40:26.124
I've been telling people about
the Jersey Devil for years.

729
00:40:26.159 --> 00:40:29.864
but they just think I'm nuts.

730
00:40:29.899 --> 00:40:31.668
- Is it real?

731
00:40:31.703 --> 00:40:35.133
- Oh. yeah. it's real.

732
00:40:35.168 --> 00:40:38.169
I saw it once when I was a kid.

733
00:40:38.204 --> 00:40:40.105
I'll never forget.

734
00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:41.039
It's huge.

735
00:40:41.075 --> 00:40:47.816
Hooves for feet. fangs.
but those horns--

736
00:40:47.851 --> 00:40:50.621
- I think that's what I saw.

737
00:40:50.656 --> 00:40:52.282
- Sarah. listen to me.

738
00:40:52.317 --> 00:40:56.759
The Jersey Devil is
pure evil. and I've

739
00:40:56.794 --> 00:40:58.024
been hunting it ever since.

740
00:41:02.096 --> 00:41:03.964
Now who sounds crazy. right?

741
00:41:03.999 --> 00:41:06.131
- No. not at all.

742
00:41:06.166 --> 00:41:07.836
In fact. I'm kind of relieved.

743
00:41:11.677 --> 00:41:12.610
- All right. all right.

744
00:41:12.645 --> 00:41:14.843
All right. thank you.

745
00:41:14.878 --> 00:41:17.043
All right. come on.

746
00:41:17.078 --> 00:41:18.946
Hold it together.

747
00:41:18.981 --> 00:41:20.882
- Right here.

748
00:41:20.917 --> 00:41:21.850
- There you go!

749
00:41:24.624 --> 00:41:25.315
You all right?

750
00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:27.856
- My leg is killing me.

751
00:41:27.891 --> 00:41:31.695
- I think I got some
aspirin over here.

752
00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:33.763
- You got anything stronger?

753
00:41:33.798 --> 00:41:35.193
- Yeah. whiskey.

754
00:41:35.228 --> 00:41:36.832
- That'll do.

755
00:41:36.867 --> 00:41:37.569
- All right.

756
00:41:46.976 --> 00:41:49.174
Here. put this on if
you're gonna get cold.

757
00:41:53.312 --> 00:41:53.882
- Thanks.

758
00:41:53.917 --> 00:41:54.586
- Mm-hmm.

759
00:41:54.621 --> 00:41:55.279
Can

760
00:41:55.314 --> 00:41:56.687
- I use your phone?

761
00:41:56.722 --> 00:41:59.756
- Give me a second here.

762
00:41:59.791 --> 00:42:00.251
- Thanks.

763
00:42:09.867 --> 00:42:12.197
- Should we call the station?

764
00:42:12.232 --> 00:42:14.199
Shouldn't we have
heard something by now?

765
00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:18.236
What was that?

766
00:42:18.271 --> 00:42:19.710
- What's what?

767
00:42:19.745 --> 00:42:20.843
- That sound.

768
00:42:20.878 --> 00:42:22.075
- Ah. it's an old house.

769
00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:23.208
Probably just the
furnace or something.

770
00:42:23.243 --> 00:42:23.912
Who knows?

771
00:42:26.752 --> 00:42:27.982
- I know you heard that.

772
00:42:33.187 --> 00:42:34.351
- Yep. that's the furnace.

773
00:42:34.386 --> 00:42:36.089
It's the oil moving
through the pipes.

774
00:42:36.124 --> 00:42:38.828
It knocks when it gets fired up.

775
00:42:38.863 --> 00:42:40.357
- Look. I'm really
worried about Alex.

776
00:42:40.392 --> 00:42:42.931
- The Sheriff will
call us. Sarah.

777
00:42:42.966 --> 00:42:44.295
Maybe we should call them.

778
00:42:47.905 --> 00:42:49.267
It's dead.

779
00:42:49.302 --> 00:42:51.742
- Look. phone lines go down
around here all the time.

780
00:42:51.777 --> 00:42:52.402
all right?

781
00:42:52.437 --> 00:42:53.103
The wind picked up.

782
00:42:53.138 --> 00:42:54.404
It probably knocked some down.

783
00:42:54.439 --> 00:42:55.405
- Well. I can't wait here.

784
00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:57.110
I have to go back out
there and look for Alex.

785
00:42:57.145 --> 00:42:58.782
- OK. well. hold
on a second. Sarah.

786
00:42:58.817 --> 00:43:00.047
Slow down. all right?

787
00:43:00.082 --> 00:43:01.653
I don't want you going
out there by yourself.

788
00:43:01.688 --> 00:43:03.787
Just let me grab a couple of
things. and then we'll go.

789
00:43:03.822 --> 00:43:04.953
all right?

790
00:43:04.988 --> 00:43:06.221
- Thank you.

791
00:43:06.256 --> 00:43:09.155
With everything you know about
those woods. you're not scared?

792
00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:11.157
- I know these woods
like the back of my hand.

793
00:43:11.192 --> 00:43:13.995
And no. I'm not scared
of the Jersey Devil.

794
00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:16.767
I suggest that if and
when we find your friend.

795
00:43:16.802 --> 00:43:18.131
you two get out of here.

796
00:43:18.166 --> 00:43:21.200
You leave this place behind.
and you never come back.

797
00:43:21.235 --> 00:43:23.037
- I don't know if
I could do that.

798
00:43:23.072 --> 00:43:25.171
- You don't know what
you're dealing with here.

799
00:43:25.206 --> 00:43:26.405
Sarah.

800
00:43:26.441 --> 00:43:28.713
- I thought you said you're
not afraid of any Jersey Devil.

801
00:43:28.748 --> 00:43:29.780
- I'm not.

802
00:43:29.815 --> 00:43:31.144
You should be.

803
00:43:31.179 --> 00:43:35.115
You. your friend. you're
something he'd like to possess.

804
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:37.315
- You seem to know a
lot about this thing.

805
00:43:37.350 --> 00:43:38.316
- I should.

806
00:43:38.351 --> 00:43:39.790
I've been studying the
folklore for the better

807
00:43:39.825 --> 00:43:40.791
part of ten years.

808
00:43:44.027 --> 00:43:44.927
- Follow me.

809
00:43:44.962 --> 00:43:46.192
- Where?

810
00:43:46.227 --> 00:43:47.424
- Trust me. I just want
to show you something.

811
00:43:47.459 --> 00:43:49.899
Then we'll go.

812
00:43:49.934 --> 00:43:50.361
Come on!

813
00:44:08.755 --> 00:44:11.019
I've been tracking the
Jersey Devil for years.

814
00:44:19.029 --> 00:44:20.963
Is this what took your friend?

815
00:44:20.998 --> 00:44:24.098
- No. it was different.

816
00:44:24.133 --> 00:44:26.133
If it was the Jersey
Devil who took her.

817
00:44:26.168 --> 00:44:28.938
what does it want with her?

818
00:44:28.973 --> 00:44:29.438
- Who knows.

819
00:44:32.471 --> 00:44:33.371
We should get going.

820
00:44:46.023 --> 00:44:49.860
- Huh. that's dead.

821
00:44:49.895 --> 00:44:50.388
- What?

822
00:44:53.228 --> 00:44:55.426
Can we use it to
charge my phone?

823
00:44:55.461 --> 00:44:56.801
- Sure. sure.

824
00:45:08.848 --> 00:45:10.782
- Mm.

825
00:45:10.817 --> 00:45:12.784
- Have a go.

826
00:45:12.819 --> 00:45:15.919
Now. how do you have
the keys to this place?

827
00:45:15.954 --> 00:45:17.151
- I'm the local handyman.

828
00:45:20.255 --> 00:45:22.453
I have keys to all
these businesses.

829
00:45:22.488 --> 00:45:24.092
That way. when I
repair something.

830
00:45:24.127 --> 00:45:27.326
I don't have to
disturb the owners.

831
00:45:27.361 --> 00:45:28.030
- Yeah.

832
00:45:28.065 --> 00:45:31.198
- Yeah. OK.

833
00:45:31.233 --> 00:45:32.232
Don't worry.

834
00:45:32.267 --> 00:45:34.905
We're gonna find your friend.

835
00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:35.400
- Yeah.

836
00:45:43.212 --> 00:45:45.212
- Looks like the wood's cut.

837
00:45:45.247 --> 00:45:47.280
I think it's safe to
say he's been rescued.

838
00:45:49.581 --> 00:45:53.055
We should head back. and we'll
figure this out in the morning.

839
00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:55.486
OK?

840
00:45:55.521 --> 00:45:56.223
Come on.

841
00:46:11.108 --> 00:46:12.503
- Hey. my phone's
got some juice.

842
00:46:15.178 --> 00:46:16.441
- Yeah.

843
00:46:16.476 --> 00:46:17.145
- Yeah.

844
00:46:22.152 --> 00:46:24.053
No service.

845
00:46:24.088 --> 00:46:28.453
- Yeah. it's
spotty. like I said.

846
00:46:28.488 --> 00:46:32.490
- So what do we do now?

847
00:46:32.525 --> 00:46:34.492
- I'm going to drive over
to the Sheriff's Office

848
00:46:34.527 --> 00:46:37.462
and see if we can pull together
a search party for your friend.

849
00:46:40.467 --> 00:46:42.104
- Hey. what's happening to me?

850
00:46:42.139 --> 00:46:44.139
- No. you're all right. son.

851
00:46:44.174 --> 00:46:44.975
You're all right.

852
00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:45.844
Ease into it.

853
00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:52.213
You'll be all right. son.

854
00:46:52.248 --> 00:46:53.181
There ya go.

855
00:47:01.125 --> 00:47:02.894
Hey. I got him.

856
00:47:02.929 --> 00:47:04.027
Yeah. we'll meet you there.

857
00:47:07.461 --> 00:47:10.000
- You almost screwed this up!

858
00:47:10.035 --> 00:47:13.168
- It's not my fault this
kid fell and broke his leg.

859
00:47:13.203 --> 00:47:14.235
- We don't have much time!

860
00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:15.533
- Tell me about it!

861
00:47:15.568 --> 00:47:16.666
- The girl!

862
00:47:16.701 --> 00:47:18.107
- Nah. he's got her.

863
00:47:18.142 --> 00:47:22.177
- Dumbass kids.

864
00:47:22.212 --> 00:47:23.378
- What were they thinking?

865
00:47:23.413 --> 00:47:26.148
They were gonna go into the
woods with a total stranger.

866
00:47:26.183 --> 00:47:27.281
and nothing would happen.

867
00:47:27.316 --> 00:47:28.513
I don't--

868
00:47:28.548 --> 00:47:30.053
- What do they call
them. "millennials?"

869
00:47:30.088 --> 00:47:30.955
- Come on. there.

870
00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:32.253
Gen Z'ers?

871
00:47:32.288 --> 00:47:34.156
- Something like that.

872
00:47:34.191 --> 00:47:37.962
Oof. milleniyears?

873
00:47:37.997 --> 00:47:38.897
All right. let's go.

874
00:47:45.367 --> 00:47:48.401
- Hey. how you doing?

875
00:47:48.436 --> 00:47:49.369
- This is all my fault!

876
00:47:49.404 --> 00:47:52.207
- Oh. whoa. whoa. Sarah!

877
00:47:52.242 --> 00:47:54.242
No. this is not your fault.

878
00:47:54.277 --> 00:47:55.474
- Really?

879
00:47:55.509 --> 00:47:58.378
- Yeah. what you're
doing is really brave.

880
00:47:58.413 --> 00:48:01.612
Searching for your cousin
like this. that's brave.

881
00:48:04.518 --> 00:48:06.683
Look. we will find
Alex in the morning.

882
00:48:06.718 --> 00:48:09.719
I promise. OK?

883
00:48:09.754 --> 00:48:11.930
Just for now. just
try to get some rest.

884
00:48:14.594 --> 00:48:15.263
Right.

885
00:48:32.018 --> 00:48:43.621
- Oh.
Hank. I don't feel good.

886
00:48:43.656 --> 00:48:44.490
Hank!

887
00:48:44.525 --> 00:48:46.657
Hank. I'm gonna throw up.

888
00:48:46.692 --> 00:48:51.200
Hank.
I'm gonna throw up!

889
00:48:51.235 --> 00:48:52.267
Hank. I don't feel good!

890
00:48:52.302 --> 00:48:53.972
Hank. I'm gonna throw up!

891
00:49:07.515 --> 00:49:11.055
- Hey. you better not
throw up in there. kid.

892
00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:12.023
I'll make ya eat it.

893
00:49:13.818 --> 00:49:14.350
- Ow!

894
00:49:14.385 --> 00:49:17.358
Oh!

895
00:49:20.396 --> 00:49:21.791
Where are you going?

896
00:49:21.826 --> 00:49:24.464
- You idiot!

897
00:49:24.499 --> 00:49:25.663
- Well. come on.

898
00:49:25.698 --> 00:49:27.071
It's not like he's
gonna get very far.

899
00:49:31.407 --> 00:49:32.505
Go get him!

900
00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:38.379
- Kid?

901
00:49:40.614 --> 00:49:42.680
You're gonna get
yourself killed in there.

902
00:51:35.894 --> 00:51:40.402
- No. no. no.

903
00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:36.782
- Kelsey?

904
00:53:45.628 --> 00:53:47.364
Oh my god. what
are you doing here?

905
00:54:02.843 --> 00:54:06.713
- Hey. hey. hey. hey. hey!

906
00:54:10.983 --> 00:54:13.357
Hello?

907
00:54:13.392 --> 00:54:15.084
Hey. hey--

908
00:54:15.119 --> 00:54:19.561
- You've turned into a
right pain in my butt.

909
00:54:19.596 --> 00:54:21.629
You think you can
outrun a bullet?

910
00:54:21.664 --> 00:54:22.861
Go for it.

911
00:54:27.637 --> 00:54:29.703
- I missed you.

912
00:54:29.738 --> 00:54:31.441
Did you have a good nap?

913
00:54:31.476 --> 00:54:33.707
Eric said you needed to rest.

914
00:54:33.742 --> 00:54:35.379
- I knew you were alive.

915
00:54:35.414 --> 00:54:39.482
I told everybody you were
alive. and no one believed me.

916
00:54:39.517 --> 00:54:41.715
- You look pretty.

917
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:43.585
- How did you get here?

918
00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:48.425
- I don't remember
much from the crash.

919
00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:49.987
- This guy's crazy?

920
00:54:50.022 --> 00:54:52.561
Who. Eric?

921
00:54:52.596 --> 00:54:53.859
No. he's nice.

922
00:54:53.894 --> 00:54:55.828
- Kels. he's been
holding you hostage.

923
00:54:55.863 --> 00:54:57.599
and he has me hostage now.

924
00:54:57.634 --> 00:54:58.732
He took care of me.

925
00:54:58.767 --> 00:54:59.865
It's not his fault!

926
00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:02.637
- Then whose fault is it?

927
00:55:02.672 --> 00:55:03.968
- It was going to kill me.

928
00:55:08.513 --> 00:55:11.382
Jersey Devil.

929
00:55:11.417 --> 00:55:12.614
- Doesn't exist.

930
00:55:12.649 --> 00:55:13.450
It's a costume.

931
00:55:13.485 --> 00:55:14.550
I saw.

932
00:55:14.585 --> 00:55:16.453
- What costume?

933
00:55:16.488 --> 00:55:17.916
- Kels. this is a bad person.

934
00:55:17.951 --> 00:55:20.721
Look at you. your face!

935
00:55:24.661 --> 00:55:26.859
- Eric said I looked beautiful.

936
00:55:26.894 --> 00:55:28.663
- You do look beautiful.

937
00:55:28.698 --> 00:55:31.534
- He said I was as
beautiful as a flower.

938
00:55:31.569 --> 00:55:32.898
He said we're family.

939
00:55:32.933 --> 00:55:35.703
- I'm your family. remember?

940
00:55:35.738 --> 00:55:36.539
I'm your cousin.

941
00:55:39.478 --> 00:55:42.413
Well. I'm here now.

942
00:55:42.448 --> 00:55:44.107
- I'm so scared.

943
00:55:44.142 --> 00:55:45.042
- That's OK.

944
00:55:45.077 --> 00:55:46.945
We have to get you out of here.

945
00:55:56.055 --> 00:55:56.724
- Stay here.

946
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:01.995
- I'm not getting in there.

947
00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:04.534
- You better get in that truck.
or your leg ain't gonna be

948
00:56:04.569 --> 00:56:06.569
the only thing that's hurtin'.

949
00:56:06.604 --> 00:56:07.163
- Where's Sarah?

950
00:56:15.173 --> 00:56:16.645
- Eric?

951
00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:18.548
Eric?

952
00:56:18.583 --> 00:56:19.813
Come quick!

953
00:56:19.848 --> 00:56:20.946
- Kelsey. what's--

954
00:56:23.885 --> 00:56:24.950
- She won't wake up.

955
00:56:29.022 --> 00:56:30.758
- What happened to her?

956
00:56:48.206 --> 00:56:51.141
Kelsey!

957
00:56:51.176 --> 00:56:51.977
Kelsey!

958
00:56:52.012 --> 00:56:53.913
Come on. you know me!

959
00:57:04.761 --> 00:57:07.597
- Kelsey. what are you doing?

960
00:57:07.632 --> 00:57:09.192
- I can't leave.

961
00:57:09.227 --> 00:57:10.600
Eric is good to me.

962
00:57:10.635 --> 00:57:11.733
He's my brother.

963
00:57:11.768 --> 00:57:12.668
- No. he's not.

964
00:57:12.703 --> 00:57:13.636
Kelsey. we have to go.

965
00:57:16.036 --> 00:57:18.707
- I can't leave my
brother like that.

966
00:57:18.742 --> 00:57:20.676
- What are you saying?

967
00:57:20.711 --> 00:57:22.645
- This is my home.

968
00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:23.206
I can't leave.

969
00:57:26.310 --> 00:57:27.012
- Kelsey!

970
00:57:53.337 --> 00:57:54.204
- Evening. Reeds.

971
00:57:54.239 --> 00:57:56.646
- Evening.

972
00:57:56.681 --> 00:57:58.043
- Oh. you found her.

973
00:57:58.078 --> 00:57:59.209
- Nah. she found us.

974
00:58:00.045 --> 00:58:01.849
- All right. let's
get her inside.

975
00:58:04.953 --> 00:58:06.557
- I have another one.

976
00:58:06.592 --> 00:58:07.591
- Hey!

977
00:58:07.626 --> 00:58:08.658
Be careful with that one.

978
00:58:20.098 --> 00:58:22.100
- Oh. look you
survive the woods.

979
00:58:22.135 --> 00:58:23.937
Sarah's been awfully
worried about you!

980
00:58:27.074 --> 00:58:30.944
- Hey. shut up. or I'll
knock you out again.

981
00:58:33.982 --> 00:58:36.048
- Eric. shut him up! .

982
00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:37.307
- Alex!

983
00:59:37.342 --> 00:59:38.044
Alex!

984
00:59:40.686 --> 00:59:41.146
- Sarah?

985
00:59:41.181 --> 00:59:41.685
- Oh!

986
00:59:45.889 --> 00:59:46.888
I thought you were dead.

987
00:59:46.923 --> 00:59:48.857
- I thought you were dead.

988
00:59:48.892 --> 00:59:50.353
What the hell is going on?

989
00:59:50.388 --> 00:59:52.289
- I found Kelsey.

990
00:59:52.324 --> 00:59:52.960
- What?

991
00:59:52.995 --> 00:59:53.730
- I found her.

992
00:59:53.765 --> 00:59:54.291
She's alive.

993
00:59:54.326 --> 00:59:56.865
She's here.

994
00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:57.866
- Where are we?

995
00:59:57.901 --> 00:59:58.900
- I don't know.

996
00:59:58.935 --> 01:00:00.770
Some place in the Pine Barrens.

997
01:00:00.805 --> 01:00:03.069
I think this has something
to do with the land dispute

998
01:00:03.104 --> 01:00:04.972
between us and the Reed family.

999
01:00:07.306 --> 01:00:09.779
- We have to get out of here.

1000
01:00:09.814 --> 01:00:13.112
What-- where is Kelsey?

1001
01:00:13.147 --> 01:00:15.048
- In the basement.

1002
01:00:15.083 --> 01:00:16.819
But we have a bigger problem.

1003
01:00:16.854 --> 01:00:17.787
- What?

1004
01:00:17.822 --> 01:00:18.755
- She doesn't wanna leave.

1005
01:00:22.024 --> 01:00:23.925
- How could you lose her?

1006
01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:24.794
- Me?

1007
01:00:24.829 --> 01:00:25.762
I was here alone.

1008
01:00:25.797 --> 01:00:26.455
Hank took forever.

1009
01:00:26.490 --> 01:00:27.389
Where were you?

1010
01:00:27.425 --> 01:00:28.798
- What do you mean.
you were here alone?

1011
01:00:28.833 --> 01:00:29.425
- What was your problem?

1012
01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:29.859
- You had one--

1013
01:00:29.894 --> 01:00:30.899
- How was it--

1014
01:00:30.934 --> 01:00:31.702
- You had one--

1015
01:00:32.232 --> 01:00:34.133
- Shh!

1016
01:00:34.168 --> 01:00:36.773
- Stop. stop. stop. stop!

1017
01:00:36.808 --> 01:00:38.742
They could hear us!

1018
01:00:38.777 --> 01:00:42.042
- This has become a much bigger
problem than we anticipated.

1019
01:00:44.508 --> 01:00:46.376
- Let's get rid of 'em.

1020
01:00:46.411 --> 01:00:48.279
- If people know that
they were coming here.

1021
01:00:48.314 --> 01:00:50.182
people will come looking
for them. all right?

1022
01:00:50.217 --> 01:00:51.953
And we don't know if
they sent an email

1023
01:00:51.988 --> 01:00:54.890
to a friend. or the newspaper.

1024
01:00:54.925 --> 01:00:55.957
- You're right.

1025
01:00:55.992 --> 01:00:57.387
She did come here to do a story.

1026
01:01:03.131 --> 01:01:04.328
Jersey Devil got 'em.

1027
01:01:04.363 --> 01:01:06.869
That's what I'm thinking.

1028
01:01:06.904 --> 01:01:08.365
The story worked for us before.

1029
01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:10.807
- There's two of 'em this time.

1030
01:01:10.842 --> 01:01:13.403
- We take 'em out one at a time.

1031
01:01:13.438 --> 01:01:14.811
- And Kelsey?

1032
01:01:14.846 --> 01:01:15.746
- She's with us.

1033
01:01:15.781 --> 01:01:17.506
She's one of us now.

1034
01:01:17.541 --> 01:01:19.849
- It's not like she
remembers anything anyways.

1035
01:01:19.884 --> 01:01:22.511
- I say we end them now.

1036
01:01:22.546 --> 01:01:24.117
- You know what?

1037
01:01:24.152 --> 01:01:27.153
I am sick of the Franklins.

1038
01:01:27.188 --> 01:01:29.518
They have caused
us so much pain!

1039
01:01:29.553 --> 01:01:34.028
We end them Jersey Devil
style. leave their bodies

1040
01:01:34.063 --> 01:01:35.260
in the woods.

1041
01:01:35.295 --> 01:01:38.527
The cops don't
even care anymore.

1042
01:01:38.562 --> 01:01:40.298
- So true.

1043
01:01:40.333 --> 01:01:42.432
They're so eager to
pin this on animals.

1044
01:01:42.467 --> 01:01:45.171
They don't want to go
searching the Devil territory.

1045
01:01:47.571 --> 01:01:48.779
- Are we in agreement?

1046
01:01:53.115 --> 01:01:55.016
All right.

1047
01:01:55.051 --> 01:01:56.182
All right. I'm going to go back.

1048
01:01:56.217 --> 01:01:59.020
I gotta cover some tracks.

1049
01:01:59.055 --> 01:02:00.219
Get this done.

1050
01:02:08.196 --> 01:02:09.525
- We have to find Kelsey fast.

1051
01:02:15.203 --> 01:02:19.172
Sarah. I have to be honest.

1052
01:02:19.207 --> 01:02:20.536
My leg isn't doing very good.

1053
01:02:20.571 --> 01:02:22.208
I mean. I might be able to
make it out of the house.

1054
01:02:22.243 --> 01:02:24.309
but I don't think I can
make it through the woods.

1055
01:02:24.344 --> 01:02:25.882
- We have to get to their car.

1056
01:02:33.122 --> 01:02:33.857
- Lay down.

1057
01:02:33.892 --> 01:02:34.550
Lay down.

1058
01:02:34.585 --> 01:02:35.485
Lay down right here.

1059
01:02:40.096 --> 01:02:44.065
- It's time for the Jersey Devil
to wreak havoc on these kids.

1060
01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:44.901
Hey. where's Alex?

1061
01:02:47.631 --> 01:02:48.531
- I'll go to the car.

1062
01:02:48.566 --> 01:02:49.499
You find Kelsey.

1063
01:02:49.534 --> 01:02:50.236
Let's go.

1064
01:03:03.086 --> 01:03:06.087
- Keys. keys. keys.

1065
01:03:15.098 --> 01:03:16.064
Keys.

1066
01:03:20.103 --> 01:03:21.465
Oh my god. Kelsey?

1067
01:03:25.042 --> 01:03:26.041
I can't believe it's you.

1068
01:03:26.076 --> 01:03:27.240
Oh my god!

1069
01:03:34.546 --> 01:03:36.920
- Wait.

1070
01:03:36.955 --> 01:03:38.889
Who are you?

1071
01:03:38.924 --> 01:03:40.990
- Kelsey. it's me. Alex.

1072
01:03:41.025 --> 01:03:43.322
I'm your boyfriend.

1073
01:03:43.357 --> 01:03:46.061
- I don't have a boyfriend.

1074
01:03:46.096 --> 01:03:49.163
I don't know who you are.

1075
01:03:49.198 --> 01:03:51.099
- It's OK.

1076
01:03:51.134 --> 01:03:52.430
Sarah came out here to find you.

1077
01:03:52.465 --> 01:03:55.301
But we have to find her.
and we have to leave. OK?

1078
01:03:57.701 --> 01:03:58.535
I missed you.

1079
01:03:58.570 --> 01:03:59.536
- Look out!

1080
01:04:12.056 --> 01:04:14.221
- I have had enough of you!

1081
01:04:29.337 --> 01:04:31.634
- You people have ruined
our lives for centuries.

1082
01:04:31.669 --> 01:04:32.943
Drop the pipe!

1083
01:04:32.978 --> 01:04:34.043
- Let us go!

1084
01:04:34.078 --> 01:04:35.374
This isn't our fight.

1085
01:04:35.409 --> 01:04:39.114
- Your family has lied
for years. taken our land.

1086
01:04:39.149 --> 01:04:41.952
taken everything
that is sacred to us.

1087
01:04:41.987 --> 01:04:44.086
Not anymore.

1088
01:04:44.121 --> 01:04:44.955
Drop the pipe!

1089
01:04:55.363 --> 01:04:58.034
- Where's Kelsey?

1090
01:04:58.069 --> 01:05:00.531
Where is Kelsey?

1091
01:05:00.566 --> 01:05:03.270
Where's Kelsey?

1092
01:05:03.305 --> 01:05:06.075
You crazy bitch. I'll kill you.

1093
01:05:16.615 --> 01:05:19.055
- What are you gonna do
with that. little girl?

1094
01:05:19.090 --> 01:05:20.089
- Don't move.

1095
01:05:20.124 --> 01:05:21.156
I swear.

1096
01:05:21.653 --> 01:05:22.355
- Beth?

1097
01:05:52.090 --> 01:05:54.255
Hell of a night. huh?

1098
01:05:54.290 --> 01:05:54.992
- Hold on.

1099
01:05:59.130 --> 01:06:00.393
- Kelsey?

1100
01:06:00.428 --> 01:06:06.168
You tell
her. Kelsey. tell her.

1101
01:06:09.338 --> 01:06:11.371
- I'm so sorry.

1102
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:44.371
We have to leave.

1103
01:06:44.406 --> 01:06:46.175
- But I can't leave my brother.

1104
01:06:46.210 --> 01:06:47.506
- Eric is not your
brother. Kelsey.

1105
01:06:47.541 --> 01:06:49.079
You don't have a brother.

1106
01:06:49.114 --> 01:06:49.838
- Yes. I do!

1107
01:06:49.873 --> 01:06:51.345
- We were in an accident.

1108
01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:52.577
- And Eric saved me!

1109
01:06:52.612 --> 01:06:55.184
- No. he dragged you off.

1110
01:06:55.219 --> 01:06:56.680
We're cousins. remember?

1111
01:06:56.715 --> 01:06:57.381
- I don't.

1112
01:06:57.416 --> 01:07:00.585
- We need to get out of here.

1113
01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:03.687
- You two aren't going anywhere.

1114
01:07:03.722 --> 01:07:07.196
You're both
gonna die tonight.

1115
01:07:11.532 --> 01:07:14.302
You don't
have the balls.

1116
01:07:19.771 --> 01:07:22.607
- Just did.

1117
01:07:22.642 --> 01:07:24.213
Come on. let's go!

1118
01:07:40.231 --> 01:07:40.691
Run!

1119
01:07:52.342 --> 01:07:53.473
- Go without me!

1120
01:07:53.508 --> 01:07:54.771
- Come on. we're right here!

1121
01:08:22.273 --> 01:08:23.767
- Don't shoot. don't shoot!

1122
01:08:23.802 --> 01:08:24.634
- Stay back!

1123
01:08:24.670 --> 01:08:27.540
- I can explain
everything. all right?

1124
01:08:27.575 --> 01:08:31.445
It's not my fault.
They made me do it.

1125
01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:32.941
The Reeds. they're nuts.

1126
01:08:32.976 --> 01:08:34.448
They told me if I didn't help
them. they were gonna kill me.

1127
01:08:34.483 --> 01:08:35.548
They were gonna kill Kelsey.

1128
01:08:35.583 --> 01:08:36.681
- You're not my brother.

1129
01:08:36.716 --> 01:08:40.949
It was you that
took me from the RV.

1130
01:08:40.984 --> 01:08:41.917
- Yes.

1131
01:08:41.952 --> 01:08:43.754
It wasn't for me. you'd
be dead. all right?

1132
01:08:43.789 --> 01:08:45.723
The Reeds have wanted this
land back in their family

1133
01:08:45.758 --> 01:08:48.627
for as long as I can remember.

1134
01:08:48.662 --> 01:08:50.827
Kelsey. your dad
just wouldn't budge.

1135
01:08:50.862 --> 01:08:52.928
I never meant for any
of this to happen.

1136
01:08:52.963 --> 01:08:53.629
Why the costume?

1137
01:08:53.664 --> 01:08:54.897
- To keep the folklore alive.

1138
01:08:54.932 --> 01:08:58.505
People want to believe in the
Jersey Devil. so we let them.

1139
01:08:58.540 --> 01:08:59.770
It's good for business.

1140
01:08:59.805 --> 01:09:03.444
I never wanted for
anyone to die. OK?

1141
01:09:03.479 --> 01:09:04.775
I'm sorry about Alex.

1142
01:09:04.810 --> 01:09:06.579
No. wait. wait.

1143
01:09:10.585 --> 01:09:12.321

- Run. Sarah. run!

1145
01:10:59.595 --> 01:11:02.563
The Devil's gonna get you.

you some questions about what

You're in on it.

1167
01:11:57.521 --> 01:11:58.487
You both are.

1168
01:11:58.522 --> 01:11:59.521
You're one of them.

1169
01:11:59.556 --> 01:12:01.721
- Honey. I'm not gonna hurt you.

1170

called the Sheriff.
