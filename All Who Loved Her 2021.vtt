- [Rianne] On the first day class.

6
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.930
Professor Rossi walked in and said.

7
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.520
it is completely normal for a man

8
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.800
to come back home from work.
hit the head of his wife

9
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.570
against the kitchen table and kill her.

10
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.167
Remember. we're still the
most dangerous animal.

(throat clearing)
(soft dramatic music)

13
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.490
- Honey. can you please pick
up your brother on Wednesday?

14
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.930
- How 'bout you send a taxi to get him?

15
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.363
- God. no.

16
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.900
If you don't want to pick him up.

17
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.503
then I will figure out a way.

18
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:55.783
- No. Mom. it's fine.

19
00:00:55.783 --> 00:00:56.616
I'll pick him up.

20
00:00:56.616 --> 00:00:57.449
It's fine.

21
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.620
I just want you to answer
something for me first.

22
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.453
- What's that?

23
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.720
- Would you visit me twice a
month if I went to prison. too?

24
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.262
- Of course not.

25
00:01:09.262 --> 00:01:11.612
No matter what you did.
they'd never catch you.

26
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.760
- That's not a valid answer.

27
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.063
- It's not the answer that you
wanted. but it is an answer.

28
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.470
Wednesday at 10.

29
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.100
Please don't be late.

30
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.090
- It's not what I asked.

31
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.893
- And please do not get in his case.

32
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.810
Okay. it's the last thing that he needs.

33
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.493
- Sure. promise.

34
00:01:46.008 --> 00:01:47.880
(hand knocking)

35
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.180
- Hey you.

36
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.000
Hey. are you back with us this term?

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.630
Wait. did you register with me?

38
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.808
How was vacation?

39
00:01:53.808 --> 00:01:55.358
Did we talk about that already?

40
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.039
- Yes. this is my final term.

41
00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.360
Yes. I chose you as my
advisor for my senior project

42
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.950
so I'm already registered.

43
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.320
No. it wasn't a vacation.

44
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.570
It was a leave of absence to
come back with a vengeance.

45
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.000
And no we haven't talked about it already.

46
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.080
Am I interrupting?

47
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.080
- Absolutely.

48
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.450
Everybody waited last minute to register.

49
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.283
- Guilty as charged.

50
00:02:12.283 --> 00:02:13.116
Sorry.

51
00:02:13.116 --> 00:02:14.760
Didn't know if I was gonna
be able to afford the time.

52
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.250
- Well. at least you're
one of the good ones.

53
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.860
so I can let it slide.

54
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.870
Anyway. if this is a social visit.

55
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:20.847
can we reschedule to next week?

56
00:02:20.847 --> 00:02:23.067
'Cause I am really busy.

57
00:02:23.067 --> 00:02:25.530
- Yeah. I actually wanted to talk

58
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.357
to you about my senior project.

59
00:02:27.357 --> 00:02:30.460
- You are making it about
your brother's case. right?

60
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.940
- But Nick is actually getting out soon.

61
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.380
- [Rossi] Already?

62
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.016
- [Rianne] Time flies.

63
00:02:36.016 --> 00:02:37.810
I'm thinking I should just move on

64
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.160
and work on something else.

65
00:02:40.571 --> 00:02:43.190
- Cool your jets. space girl.

66
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.390
How close are you to him?

67
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.180
Because you've been working
on his case for years.

68
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.090
If you push through. you could even write

69
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.430
that book you always talk about.

70
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.963
- It would be too personal.

71
00:02:55.662 --> 00:02:58.002
- Let me be blunt here.

72
00:02:58.002 --> 00:03:03.002
You have never been a normal
person and you never will be.

73
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.200
And yes. I know when I'm
talking about weirdos.

74
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.220
I'm the worst one out there.

75
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.680
but you have to embrace what you're about

76
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.790
and push beyond that.

77
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.053
You know this already.

78
00:03:13.908 --> 00:03:15.440
You have a beautiful mind.

79
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.662
Use it.

80
00:03:16.662 --> 00:03:19.963
Just be the hunter you are meant to be.

81
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.160
- I was talking more about his feelings.

82
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.469
but I guess you kind of have a point.

83
00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:26.569
- Kind of?

84
00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.973
You just came here for
the pep talk. didn't you?

85
00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:31.540
Come on. pitch it to me.

86
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.940
Rough is fine.

87
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:33.773
Just shoot.

88
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.490
- Passion crimes is a
gateway to serial killing.

89
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:39.870
- Wow. I love it.

90
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.680
Wait. are you saying you think

91
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.840
your brother's gonna kill more people?

92
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.690
- I was thinking of using him
as the passion crimes part.

93
00:03:48.642 --> 00:03:50.043
- I'm sold.

94
00:03:50.043 --> 00:03:52.510
Just iron it up and send me the layout.

95
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.660
- Oh. well now. hold on.

96
00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.829
I didn't say I was gonna do it.

97
00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.810
I wanna see how things are
with Nick at home first.

98
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.300
- Well. come back when you've
made up your mind. okay.

99
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.133
Bye now.

100
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.433
- Will due.

101
00:04:04.433 --> 00:04:05.700
Thanks.

102
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.250
- A pleasure as always.

103
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.200
- [Rianne] Bye now.

104
00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.893
- I guess this is as good a spot as any.

105
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.850
So the big question is-

106
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.347
- Whoa. are you proposing?

107
00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:25.560
No. no. no. no. no.

108
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.393
Don't. don't. don't.

109
00:04:26.393 --> 00:04:27.370
I don't want you to propose.

110
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.203
No.

111
00:04:28.203 --> 00:04:29.550
- I'm just asking you want to eat here.

112
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.550
- Oh. you made it sound like a big moment.

113
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.763
Yes. I am starving.

114
00:04:40.347 --> 00:04:42.253
I don't wanna pick him up.

115
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.490
- Is he really dangerous?

116
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.363
- No. he's just an asshole.

117
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.990
Professor Rossi is right.

118
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.133
This could be my book.

119
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.500
- Boo. you don't even like your brother.

120
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.420
You probably won't see him
again after you graduate.

121
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.368
Do what's best for you.

122
00:05:05.368 --> 00:05:09.705
Nobody cares about your
future as much as you do.

123
00:05:09.705 --> 00:05:12.318
Except me of course.

124
00:05:12.318 --> 00:05:14.420
I just wanna know about your future.

125
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.973
so I can plan around your crazy fantasies.

126
00:05:18.018 --> 00:05:20.447
- Can you imagine how boring
your life would be without me?

127
00:05:20.447 --> 00:05:23.240
You're always so predictable and stable.

128
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.073
- Oh yeah.

129
00:05:24.073 --> 00:05:26.246
I fantasize about it all the time.

130
00:05:26.246 --> 00:05:27.143
- Babe.

131
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.923
- But I wouldn't trade
my boo for anything ever.

132
00:05:34.747 --> 00:05:36.570
- What would I do without you?

133
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.778
- You'd probably just slowly drift away.

134
00:05:39.778 --> 00:05:41.244
- Mm hm.

135
00:05:41.244 --> 00:05:44.411
(soft dramatic music)

136
00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.593
Sorry. I'm late.

137
00:06:23.866 --> 00:06:26.676
- What's up with the costume?

138
00:06:26.676 --> 00:06:28.143
- It's not a costume.

139
00:06:30.058 --> 00:06:32.073
- Whatever you say. Marilyn Manson.

140
00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.290
- Look. I wanna be left alone.

141
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.230
You wanna be left alone.

142
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.010
Let's just stay out of
each other's way. okay.

143
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.843
- Or else?

144
00:06:41.751 --> 00:06:44.673
- What do you want from me. Nick?

145
00:06:44.673 --> 00:06:47.840
(soft dramatic music)

146
00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.570
- I want you help me find Gwen's killer.

147
00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:52.923
- Seriously?

148
00:06:52.923 --> 00:06:53.915
You haven't even been out a day

149
00:06:53.915 --> 00:06:55.350
and that's what's on your mind?

150
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:56.640
- What else you want me to think about?

151
00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.962
Going to a costume party with you?

152
00:06:58.962 --> 00:07:01.180
- Can't you just move on?

153
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.289
- No. I can't just move on.

154
00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:04.560
If you've ever been in
love. then you'd know that.

155
00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.260
- Oh. you think you're the first person

156
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.970
to fall in love like ever?

157
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:09.700
- No. but compared to
you I'm a fucking expert.

158
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.867
- Oh yeah. you were in one
relationship in you're an expert.

159
00:07:11.867 --> 00:07:12.949
- It wasn't one relationship.

160
00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:14.300
It was the relationship.

161
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.920
- [Rianne] Okay. Nick.

162
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.064
- [Nick] So you're gonna help me or not?

163
00:07:17.064 --> 00:07:18.300
- No.

164
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.400
Of course not.

165
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.920
Okay. can't you tell that the entire rest

166
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.263
of the world has moved on?

167
00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:29.003
- You know. Gwen always
tried to include you in it.

168
00:07:33.507 --> 00:07:35.403
- Are you guilt tripping me?

169
00:07:37.762 --> 00:07:38.933
- How can I?

170
00:07:38.933 --> 00:07:40.384
You don't care about anybody.

171
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.280
- Please.

172
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.113
- All right.

173
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.690
Guess just have to do it myself.

174
00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:49.523
- Oh yeah.

175
00:07:49.523 --> 00:07:51.843
And what are you gonna do
when you find him. kill him?

176
00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:59.233
You know. you can't go around
saying things like that.

177
00:07:59.233 --> 00:08:00.683
At least not in front of mom.

178
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.930
- You could pretend to
tolerate me. Rianne.

179
00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:06.873
at least in front of mom.

180
00:08:06.873 --> 00:08:07.763
- I told you.

181
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:10.370
You leave me alone. I'll leave you alone.

182
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:11.430
- Fine. let's do that.

183
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:12.563
- Okay. let's do that.

184
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.960
- He really thought you
weren't gonna leave him a tip.

185
00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:25.793
- I thought about it.

186
00:08:25.793 --> 00:08:28.430
You expect me to behave
like a lady when I'm hungry.

187
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.200
- His face was priceless.

188
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.053
I don't think I can let you do that.

189
00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:35.970
- Maybe he's just from France. babe.

190
00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.159
- No way in hell he's French. boo.

191
00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:41.063
His accent changed like
15 times during the meal.

192
00:08:46.362 --> 00:08:47.453
- What is it?

193
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.300
- My mom.

194
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.090
She just drained all the
money from my account.

195
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:54.797
- I'm sorry. babe.

196
00:08:54.797 --> 00:08:56.630
- It was a matter of time.

197
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:58.300
She can't say no to him.

198
00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:00.200
- Yeah. but it didn't even take a day.

199
00:09:03.941 --> 00:09:07.868
We're not gonna let this
bring us down. all right?

200
00:09:07.868 --> 00:09:10.563
We'll get through this
just like we always do.

201
00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:15.110
Plus you have me. the hottest. smartest.

202
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:16.500
bestest girlfriend ever.

203
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.390
- Bestest?

204
00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.430
Really. babe?

205
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:19.540
- You're such a grammar Nazi.

206
00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.850
- I'm just saying bestest is not a word.

207
00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:23.330
- Stop. stop.

208
00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.127
This is about me supporting you.

209
00:09:26.127 --> 00:09:27.927
Don't you try to change the subject.

210
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:33.773
Just remember I love you tons.

211
00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:35.653
- [Rianne] Okay.

212
00:09:35.653 --> 00:09:37.310
- Anyway. this cute brain of yours

213
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.760
probably came up with a
plan for this months ago.

214
00:09:42.663 --> 00:09:45.830
(soft dramatic music)

215
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.540
- I understand how you feel.
bro. but what are you gonna do?

216
00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.890
Go around and ask if they
killed your girlfriend?

217
00:09:58.890 --> 00:09:59.820
- No.

218
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.630
I'm gonna ask if they know who killed her.

219
00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:03.690
Pay good money for it. too.

220
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:05.570
- It's only gonna mess with
your head trying to figure out

221
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:07.950
if the leads they give you are true.

222
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:08.810
- Well if you have a better idea-

223
00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:10.040
- I do.

224
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.703
Get a job. move on. try to
catch up with your life.

225
00:10:15.199 --> 00:10:18.477
- You know I can't do that. man.

226
00:10:18.477 --> 00:10:20.413
- Well. if you change your mind.

227
00:10:21.299 --> 00:10:23.477
my boss agreed to meet with you.

228
00:10:23.477 --> 00:10:25.500
It's not an interview though.

229
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.453
It's more of a meet and
greet type of thing.

230
00:10:28.453 --> 00:10:29.370
- Thanks. man.

231
00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:30.203
That's cool.

232
00:10:30.203 --> 00:10:31.036
Thanks. man.

233
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:35.977
Is this the company?

234
00:10:35.977 --> 00:10:38.863
- No. that's a taxi service
I do through the phone.

235
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:41.820
- Sounds legit.

236
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:42.653
Does it pay well?

237
00:10:42.653 --> 00:10:43.830
Maybe I can do that.

238
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:45.344
- Pays all right.

239
00:10:45.344 --> 00:10:47.223
You just wouldn't qualify.

240
00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:49.723
Sorry.

241
00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:51.493
- True.

242
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:55.710
- [Julian] You wanna see something cool?

243
00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.079
- [Nick] Sure.

244
00:10:57.079 --> 00:10:58.483
- [Julian] Check this out.

245
00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:00.453
- [Nick] What's that?

246
00:11:00.453 --> 00:11:01.286
- A camera.

247
00:11:04.274 --> 00:11:06.016
- What do you mean a camera?

248
00:11:06.016 --> 00:11:07.099
No. it's not.

249
00:11:09.293 --> 00:11:10.330
- It's HD. bro.

250
00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:11.981
Sometimes people get rowdy.

251
00:11:11.981 --> 00:11:12.814
- [Nick] What the fuck?

252
00:11:12.814 --> 00:11:13.913
This thing is puny.

253
00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.223
- And it's motion activated. right.

254
00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:20.450
Cool or not cool?

255
00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:22.305
- Really fucking cool.

256
00:11:22.305 --> 00:11:23.138
Holy.

257
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:30.580
Man.

258
00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:31.413
Things change.

259
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.490
- Listen. I know Gwen
was something else but-

260
00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:37.323
- Stop.

261
00:11:37.323 --> 00:11:38.156
- [Julian] You should be open to the idea.

262
00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:38.989
- Stop.

263
00:11:38.989 --> 00:11:40.009
- [Julian] I'm seeing a
super cute girl right now.

264
00:11:40.009 --> 00:11:40.842
- Quit it.

265
00:11:40.842 --> 00:11:42.740
- [Julian] It's not too
serious. but it's really nice

266
00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.140
to have someone else around.

267
00:11:49.227 --> 00:11:50.190
- It's gonna take me a second

268
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:52.033
to start thinking about girls again. man.

269
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:57.283
- Anyway. I gotta get back to work. man.

270
00:11:57.283 --> 00:11:58.116
- Yeah.

271
00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.428
- Just one more thing though.

272
00:12:01.428 --> 00:12:02.261
- What?

273
00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.920
- I didn't tell my boss
why you went to prison.

274
00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.687
so when you meet with her
just don't go into details.

275
00:12:09.687 --> 00:12:11.339
You know what I mean?

276
00:12:11.339 --> 00:12:14.089
- Yeah. I wasn't planning to but.

277
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:17.060
Thanks a lot for the hookup. man.

278
00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:18.753
- Yeah. yeah. got you.

279
00:12:19.677 --> 00:12:21.377
You might wanna take care of this.

280
00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:23.923
- Care of what?

281
00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:25.783
- All that.

282
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:35.000
- Shit. I didn't even think about it.

283
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.420
- Yeah bro. you gotta
look good to feel good.

284
00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:39.420
Right now you don't look good at all so.

285
00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:42.613
- Yeah.

286
00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.174
Yeah.

287
00:12:46.174 --> 00:12:47.007
Well thanks. man.

288
00:12:47.007 --> 00:12:47.840
- [Julian] Yeah.

289
00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.223
- I like this new look. hon.

290
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:02.147
It suits you.

291
00:13:02.147 --> 00:13:03.840
- It's not like I wasn't gonna clean up

292
00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.320
before going to my interviews.

293
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.153
- Wait.

294
00:13:06.153 --> 00:13:07.490
You got an interview already?

295
00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:08.630
- It's like those manifestation books

296
00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:10.130
you gave me always say. right.

297
00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:14.900
- Everything finds its place.

298
00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:16.720
- [Nick] It's finally happening. Mom.

299
00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.700
Yeah. yeah.

300
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.073
Better enjoy me while I
still got free time. kid.

301
00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:23.364
- What do you mean?

302
00:13:23.364 --> 00:13:27.055
- Well. I told you that your
brother is staying with us.

303
00:13:27.055 --> 00:13:28.222
- Permanently?

304
00:13:29.254 --> 00:13:30.600
- Why are you defensive?

305
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.800
Didn't I drive you to your
piano lessons every week

306
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.420
when you had to become a virtuoso.

307
00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.130
- Yeah. so you could take
the car and screw Gwen.

308
00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:38.570
- Yeah well. what about when I bought

309
00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:39.613
your classmates lunch every Saturday

310
00:13:39.613 --> 00:13:40.980
because you were too much of a nerd

311
00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:41.813
to make your own friends?

312
00:13:41.813 --> 00:13:42.690
- Yeah. every penny Mom gave you.

313
00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:44.740
then you would use it to impress Gwen.

314
00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:45.573
- Well. it worked out. didn't it?

315
00:13:45.573 --> 00:13:46.750
Because she was crazy about me.

316
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:48.540
- Mm hm. how'd it work out for her?

317
00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.440
- Stop it. Rianne.

318
00:13:55.970 --> 00:14:00.970
Anyway. I am very happy
that you're starting

319
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:02.960
to think about your future already.

320
00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:03.793
- Yeah.

321
00:14:05.868 --> 00:14:07.470
Talking about the future.

322
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:08.303
I was.

323
00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:11.800
- What is going on?

324
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.680
- I was talking to your
brother about the fact

325
00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.690
that you and Mariah spend
so much time together

326
00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:19.333
and you might be moving in with her soon.

327
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.520
- Are you kicking me out?

328
00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.580
- No.

329
00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:27.521
We're just planning ahead. that's all.

330
00:14:27.521 --> 00:14:28.460
- What's next?

331
00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.488
Selling my organs to pay for his new suit?

332
00:14:30.488 --> 00:14:35.423
- Well Mom did always say that
you eat really healthy so.

333
00:14:35.423 --> 00:14:38.590
(soft dramatic music)

334
00:15:09.093 --> 00:15:10.233
It's okay. kid.

335
00:15:11.206 --> 00:15:14.700
Thought I'd apologize for spazzing out.

336
00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:17.340
- Why are you always such an asshole?

337
00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.990
- Oh probably because you're
always such a snowflake.

338
00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:23.253
You moving out?

339
00:15:25.534 --> 00:15:30.293
- Look. I can't help
you with your project.

340
00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.603
but this might be a good place to start.

341
00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:37.893
- What's that?

342
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:41.890
- After the cops left your place.

343
00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:43.300
I took anything that I thought might be

344
00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:44.463
of sentimental value.

345
00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.233
- My stuff?

346
00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:51.803
- Mostly Gwen's.

347
00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:53.948
I think.

348
00:15:53.948 --> 00:15:57.115
(soft dramatic music)

349
00:15:58.110 --> 00:15:59.197
- Thanks.

350
00:15:59.197 --> 00:16:02.364
(soft dramatic music)

351
00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.618
- Bye.

352
00:16:04.618 --> 00:16:07.785
(soft dramatic music)

353
00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.940
I'm making my senior project
on Gwen Anderson's case.

354
00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.650
I'm gonna try to fill in
all the missing information

355
00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:17.990
and then make a psychological profile

356
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:19.933
of the killer to wrap it all up.

357
00:16:19.933 --> 00:16:20.766
- And what is this?

358
00:16:20.766 --> 00:16:22.080
- The research I did three years ago.

359
00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.120
It has a timeline of the crime

360
00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.360
and a list of all the missing information

361
00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.193
for your reference.

362
00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:26.170
By Cameron.

363
00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:27.400
- Wait. wait. wait.

364
00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.980
- Are you saying you
talked to your brother

365
00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:30.788
and he agreed to help you with this?

366
00:16:30.788 --> 00:16:32.033
- Kinda.

367
00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:33.853
- Sit down.

368
00:16:36.608 --> 00:16:37.950
- I have most of the data

369
00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:39.460
from the research I did three years ago.

370
00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:41.190
My brother can help fill
in some of the blanks.

371
00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:42.023
but other than that-

372
00:16:42.023 --> 00:16:43.902
- Blanks that are crucial.

373
00:16:43.902 --> 00:16:46.083
He may even show you where the knife is.

374
00:16:46.083 --> 00:16:46.985
- Well the way I see it.

375
00:16:46.985 --> 00:16:49.370
I don't wanna be overambitious and fail.

376
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:52.070
- That's the most not Rianne
thing you have ever said.

377
00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:55.810
- Like you said. I can save
the best part for the book

378
00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:57.130
and go into that with more detail

379
00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:59.710
without the deadline of graduation.

380
00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:00.543
- And I like that.

381
00:17:00.543 --> 00:17:02.340
That sounds more like you.

382
00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.430
Well just keep me updated

383
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.786
so I know you're not losing perspective.

384
00:17:05.786 --> 00:17:06.762
- Will do.

385
00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:09.433
Bye. Cameron.

386
00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:11.647
- Bye now.

387
00:17:11.647 --> 00:17:14.815
(soft dramatic music)

388
00:18:31.874 --> 00:18:36.565
(phone beeping)
(soft dramatic music)

389
00:18:36.565 --> 00:18:40.274
(phone ringing)
(soft dramatic music)

390
00:18:40.274 --> 00:18:41.520
- Yeah. hi.

391
00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.813
Is Katie Morrison there?

392
00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:45.626
Sorry. wrong number.

393
00:18:45.626 --> 00:18:46.459
I'm sorry.

394
00:18:53.225 --> 00:18:56.392
(soft dramatic music)

395
00:18:58.748 --> 00:19:03.748
(soft dramatic music)
(keyboard clacking)

396
00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:18.577
(soft dramatic music)

397
00:19:34.762 --> 00:19:39.762
(phone ringing)
(soft dramatic music)

398
00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.693
Yeah. is Samantha L. there?

399
00:19:47.693 --> 00:19:48.860
Samantha Latt?

400
00:19:54.773 --> 00:19:56.913
- Spit it out. Nick.

401
00:19:58.374 --> 00:19:59.207
- Okay.

402
00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:00.993
I think.

403
00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:07.770
If I just look over her
last few days or weeks.

404
00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:11.590
then I'll probably be
able to find some clue

405
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:14.090
or some lead or something.

406
00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:17.027
- I told the cops everything.

407
00:20:17.027 --> 00:20:18.653
There's not much left to say.

408
00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.450
- I think she was seeing somebody else.

409
00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:30.440
- Well. it's obvious
that whoever killed her

410
00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.923
hated her or loved her.

411
00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:37.963
Why else would he have
stabbed her 27 times?

412
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:41.470
- Well if he knew her.
then he would've come here.

413
00:20:42.419 --> 00:20:45.660
He would've visited
her. checked in on her.

414
00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:46.900
Dropped her off. picked her up.

415
00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.623
- I don't know what to tell you.

416
00:20:49.586 --> 00:20:53.630
- Was she acting funny
in the last few days?

417
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:54.700
Skipping work?

418
00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:55.650
Leaving work early?

419
00:21:02.497 --> 00:21:06.126
You know. Gwen told me a story about you.

420
00:21:06.126 --> 00:21:07.470
Time that you saved that kid

421
00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:09.483
from getting hit at the supermarket.

422
00:21:12.332 --> 00:21:16.307
Then you fractured your
eye socket when he hit you.

423
00:21:17.387 --> 00:21:19.083
And you almost lost that eye.

424
00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:27.090
And I always thought that's somebody

425
00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:28.823
that I want taking care of my kid.

426
00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.750
I just always wanted to say that.

427
00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:38.170
Anyways. thanks for seeing me.

428
00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:41.693
- Wait.

429
00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:47.593
Sit down.

430
00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:58.740
I never was comfortable
with their relationship.

431
00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:01.300
However to be fair. they
were very professional

432
00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:02.380
at least until the end.

433
00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:03.463
- What do you mean?

434
00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.820
- Well. she had a friend here.

435
00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:08.390
About a month before she was killed.

436
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:10.053
they had a falling out.

437
00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.363
Never thought much about it until now.

438
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:19.020
- You didn't tell the cops this because?

439
00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:24.020
- The cops talked to him. but
it was different back then.

440
00:22:29.746 --> 00:22:32.623
- And when you said that you didn't

441
00:22:32.623 --> 00:22:35.580
have anything else to tell me?

442
00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.363
- I knew it was much more
complicated than it seemed.

443
00:22:42.246 --> 00:22:44.890
I think about it sometimes.

444
00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:48.540
but I just always felt
I shouldn't get involved

445
00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:50.363
without knowing all the facts.

446
00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:59.313
Gwen liked to talk and he liked to listen.

447
00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:10.063
Maybe he remembers if she
was going through something.

448
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:12.023
- Cameron?

449
00:23:12.023 --> 00:23:14.730
- Yeah. he was devastated
when he found out.

450
00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:15.900
- Cameron who?

451
00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:17.350
What's his last name?

452
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:18.183
- Porter.

453
00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:20.820
- Samantha.

454
00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:21.653
Thank you.

455
00:23:22.786 --> 00:23:24.708
Thank you very much.

456
00:23:24.708 --> 00:23:27.875
(soft dramatic music)

457
00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:50.340
You knew I didn't kill Gwen.

458
00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:53.060
- What?

459
00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:54.450
- And yet you didn't bother to look

460
00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:56.690
at any of the things
that you put in the box.

461
00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:58.353
- Those were personal things.

462
00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:01.700
- You have a beautiful mind.

463
00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.820
Use it.

464
00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:05.220
Mr. P.

465
00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:06.830
- Who's Mr. P.?

466
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:10.450
- Mr. Porter was our math
teacher in middle school.

467
00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:12.130
You know that cool teacher

468
00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:13.970
everybody wanted to be friends with?

469
00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:17.150
- And he gave that book to Gwen?

470
00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:19.760
- In eighth grade just a few years

471
00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.550
before they worked
together at the orphanage.

472
00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:23.999
- That's creepy.

473
00:24:23.999 --> 00:24:25.630
If you're going where
I think you're going.

474
00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:27.880
- Yeah. it seems like
they were pretty close.

475
00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:34.823
This card was also in the box.

476
00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:43.963
- Wait a minute.

477
00:24:43.963 --> 00:24:44.941
You think the same guy-

478
00:24:44.941 --> 00:24:46.220
- Honestly. I'm just all over
the fucking place right now.

479
00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:48.970
I could really use a cool
head to help me see straight.

480
00:24:53.799 --> 00:24:54.653
- Okay.

481
00:24:54.653 --> 00:24:56.153
Can you move back?

482
00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.510
Look. we need to organize ourselves

483
00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:00.310
before making contact with him.

484
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:01.930
Make a timeline of where

485
00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:03.700
and how often he was contact with Gwen.

486
00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:06.500
That way we can anticipate
any alibi he might have

487
00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:07.340
and stay ahead of him.

488
00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:08.670
- Okay. why not just confront him?

489
00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:09.503
- No.

490
00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.660
If he knows that we're onto him.

491
00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:16.070
he could destroy any
link he has to the case.

492
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:17.620
I mean. he may have kept
the knife as a trophy.

493
00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:19.470
so we should try and find that first.

494
00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:24.723
Nick.

495
00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.030
It's imperative that we
do not reach out to him

496
00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:30.173
until we know as much as we can. okay.

497
00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:33.513
I mean it.

498
00:25:33.513 --> 00:25:35.450
Don't contact him until we're both ready.

499
00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:37.711
- Heard you the first
time. kid. all right.

500
00:25:37.711 --> 00:25:39.860
This is what he looks like. by the way.

501
00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:41.713
He's a real dapper dresser.

502
00:25:42.889 --> 00:25:43.722
What are you thinking?

503
00:25:43.722 --> 00:25:45.717
What?

504
00:25:45.717 --> 00:25:47.873
- We should be very careful.

505
00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:51.330
- Hey.

506
00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:53.240
- What does the P stand for?

507
00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.073
- What?

508
00:25:57.330 --> 00:25:59.910
- What does the P stand for?

509
00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:01.750
What's your middle name?

510
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:04.344
- The P stands for Porter
which is my last name

511
00:26:04.344 --> 00:26:06.640
and my middle name is something else.

512
00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:09.483
which I will never tell
you or anyone else.

513
00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:13.030
- I thought your last name was Rossi.

514
00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:14.570
- Well that's my second last name.

515
00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:16.230
I'm Hispanic. remember?

516
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:17.920
People around here kept using Rossi.

517
00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.600
so I stopped trying to explain it to them.

518
00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.921
Anyway. what do you need?

519
00:26:22.921 --> 00:26:25.691
(soft dramatic music)

520
00:26:25.691 --> 00:26:27.893
- [Rianne] We found a suspect.

521
00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:31.856
- Wait. what do you mean?

522
00:26:31.856 --> 00:26:33.480
Are you saying Nick didn't do it?

523
00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.020
- First of all. all the evidence they had

524
00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:36.470
on Nick was circumstantial.

525
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:38.990
And second of all. we found out that Gwen

526
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:41.910
had a falling out with a
coworker that she was close with.

527
00:26:43.175 --> 00:26:44.460
- Go on.

528
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:45.650
- You know. it actually seems

529
00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:47.493
like they knew each other for years.

530
00:26:50.416 --> 00:26:52.760
And if that's true. imagine this.

531
00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:57.990
Imagine that you are that guy
and you've been seeing Gwen

532
00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:00.680
and you're totally invested in her.

533
00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:04.663
She's the love of your life and then boom.

534
00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:08.696
You find out that she'll
leave you for her boyfriend.

535
00:27:08.696 --> 00:27:10.787
which means you're the disposable one.

536
00:27:11.794 --> 00:27:13.877
That would be the motive.

537
00:27:15.326 --> 00:27:16.493
- But what if?

538
00:27:17.425 --> 00:27:19.950
What if it was the other way around?

539
00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:22.030
What if this guy was Gwen's real partner

540
00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:25.920
and it was Nick the one who
lost it when he found out?

541
00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:27.630
I mean. we know Gwen
was seeing other people.

542
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:29.430
Why would this one be any different?

543
00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:32.138
- This one loved her.

544
00:27:32.138 --> 00:27:34.570
- And the others didn't?

545
00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:36.463
- The others were too young.

546
00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:40.523
This one was a real
man hopelessly in love.

547
00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:43.230
- How do you know Nick's not using you

548
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:45.260
to blame someone else?

549
00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:46.600
- Nick. no.

550
00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.280
Doesn't have it in him.

551
00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:49.923
- We all think it's not in us.

552
00:27:51.119 --> 00:27:53.810
That's what's so fascinating
about passion crimes.

553
00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:56.350
Everybody is a suspect.

554
00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:57.920
What else?

555
00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.423
- That's it for now.

556
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:04.433
- Well. if Nick didn't do it.
we need to find out who did.

557
00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:06.510
Keep going.

558
00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:07.610
You're onto something.

559
00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:10.683
Wait.

560
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.290
Did you ever find out what
happened to Katie Morrison?

561
00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:16.200
- No.

562
00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.390
Why?

563
00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:18.670
- I always thought it was strange

564
00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:20.740
she went missing right after.

565
00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:22.821
I mean. if Nick didn't kill Gwen.

566
00:28:22.821 --> 00:28:25.270
wouldn't Katie be the next suspect?

567
00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:27.476
- I don't have anything on her.

568
00:28:27.476 --> 00:28:30.643
(soft dramatic music)

569
00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:09.550
- Hi. I'm Mariah.

570
00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:10.550
I'm Rianne's friend.

571
00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:14.650
- Nick. but you probably
know about me. right.

572
00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:16.026
- A thing or two.

573
00:29:16.026 --> 00:29:19.419
- Rianne hasn't told me a thing about you.

574
00:29:19.419 --> 00:29:23.010
but we can all clearly see
that you make her very happy.

575
00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:24.600
which is surprising really.

576
00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.420
- She likes perfection.

577
00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:27.380
What can I say?

578
00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:28.540
- Yeah. well it's nice to that yeah.

579
00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:30.890
she found some sugar for her coffee.

580
00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:32.790
- Is that an innuendo?

581
00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:33.623
- No. no. no. no.

582
00:29:33.623 --> 00:29:35.203
Like.

583
00:29:35.203 --> 00:29:37.550
You're like the sweet part of her life.

584
00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:38.740
- I'm just messing with you.

585
00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:40.450
I know what you meant.

586
00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:41.660
- Oh.

587
00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:42.493
Sorry.

588
00:29:42.493 --> 00:29:45.293
She can be pretty extreme so.

589
00:29:45.293 --> 00:29:46.726
- Oh. I would know. trust me.

590
00:29:46.726 --> 00:29:47.559
- Yeah?

591
00:29:47.559 --> 00:29:49.062
You think you know her well?

592
00:29:49.062 --> 00:29:50.213
- You think you know her better?

593
00:29:50.213 --> 00:29:51.247
- I mean. well you know about the time

594
00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:56.730
that she sprained her ankle
while playing hooky. right?

595
00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:57.563
Or what about the time

596
00:29:57.563 --> 00:29:58.640
that she went skinny
dipping at public point?

597
00:29:58.640 --> 00:29:59.473
Know about that?

598
00:29:59.473 --> 00:30:00.670
- Skinny dipping?

599
00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:05.400
- This girl runs into the city
pool butt ass fucking naked.

600
00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:06.770
Okay. can you imagine that?

601
00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:07.603
- No freaking way.

602
00:30:07.603 --> 00:30:08.644
She would never do that.

603
00:30:08.644 --> 00:30:11.080
- I couldn't find my swimsuit
because this jerk hid it.

604
00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:11.913
- Oh.

605
00:30:11.913 --> 00:30:14.000
Dude. she didn't care about that. okay.

606
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.740
She runs out.

607
00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:17.410
Just stripped.

608
00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:18.711
She was really skinny back then. too.

609
00:30:18.711 --> 00:30:20.030
so she was running like a
little stick figure. you know.

610
00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:20.863
Like an old cartoon.

611
00:30:20.863 --> 00:30:21.858
Like she runs in.

612
00:30:21.858 --> 00:30:22.960
She couldn't swim either.

613
00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:23.870
She was like kneeing in the noodle.

614
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:25.560
She was like ah splish splash.

615
00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.490
Ah.

616
00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:27.630
- You're full of crap.

617
00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:28.720
- [Nick] I am dead serious.

618
00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.553
Ask her.
- I'm ready.

619
00:30:29.553 --> 00:30:30.500
Lets go.

620
00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.130
- It was fun meeting you.

621
00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:34.050
- Nice to meet you. too.

622
00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:34.883
See ya.

623
00:30:34.883 --> 00:30:35.966
- [Nick] Bye.

624
00:30:43.973 --> 00:30:45.663
- Want more ice cream. boo?

625
00:30:45.663 --> 00:30:47.033
- No thanks. babe.

626
00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:52.043
- Are you annoyed that I
talked to your brother?

627
00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.213
- No. I'm annoyed that
you keep bringing it up.

628
00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:57.440
- Okay. got it.

629
00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:02.770
- Why does he think he's so smart?

630
00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:04.833
- I think he's just trying to compensate.

631
00:31:04.833 --> 00:31:07.277
- Compensate for what?

632
00:31:07.277 --> 00:31:10.320
- I don't know. everything.

633
00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.170
- He's smart. funny. handsome.

634
00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:14.030
and even my gay girlfriend
thinks he's a catch.

635
00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:14.863
What more does he want?

636
00:31:14.863 --> 00:31:17.810
- You know that's not how it works.

637
00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:19.350
He's just afraid.

638
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:21.050
- Afraid of what?

639
00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:22.844
- Of you. boo.

640
00:31:22.844 --> 00:31:25.700
You're like a walking brain
always analyzing everything

641
00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:28.820
and absorbing information and finding out

642
00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:31.043
all the right answers at the same time.

643
00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.150
As annoying as it sounds.
I know I can call you up

644
00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:36.450
because you're always right.

645
00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:38.933
- Is that what you think of me?

646
00:31:38.933 --> 00:31:40.683
That I'm a walking computer?

647
00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:43.983
- I'm sorry. boo.

648
00:31:43.983 --> 00:31:45.943
I shouldn't get involved between you two.

649
00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:48.130
- Oh. no.

650
00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:50.280
It's too late to be sorry.

651
00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:52.040
Now you're gonna have to make it up to me.

652
00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:54.600
- You're so manipulative sometimes.

653
00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:57.253
What do I have to do?

654
00:31:57.253 --> 00:31:59.070
- Can you get me some more ice cream?

655
00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:00.820
- You just said you didn't.

656
00:32:03.194 --> 00:32:05.383
What flavor do you want?

657
00:32:05.383 --> 00:32:08.550
(soft dramatic music)

658
00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:45.470
- Looking sharp.

659
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:46.810
- How long you fucking Gwen?

660
00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:48.130
- What?

661
00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:50.271
- You fuck her the day she died?

662
00:32:50.271 --> 00:32:52.940
- Yo man. you're really freaking me out.

663
00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:54.410
- You fucking piece of shit.

664
00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:55.243
- Hey. man.

665
00:32:55.243 --> 00:32:56.076
Hey. you should've told her.

666
00:32:56.076 --> 00:32:57.870
You should've told her that. man.

667
00:32:57.870 --> 00:32:58.703
You get in my face.

668
00:32:58.703 --> 00:33:00.420
Never forced her to do anything.

669
00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:02.530
She liked being with
dudes since high school.

670
00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:04.169
Everybody knew that.

671
00:33:04.169 --> 00:33:05.170
- She liked attention.

672
00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:06.003
That doesn't mean you get

673
00:33:06.003 --> 00:33:07.230
to take advantage of her like that. man.

674
00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:08.370
- Nobody took advantage of her.

675
00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:10.560
She's a grown ass woman.

676
00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:11.883
- She was a fucking kid.

677
00:33:13.378 --> 00:33:15.150
All right. she couldn't say no. you idiot.

678
00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:17.377
- Nick. that's who she was.

679
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:19.570
She liked getting it on.

680
00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:21.040
She liked the attention.

681
00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.640
There's nothing wrong with that.

682
00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:25.433
- Who else?

683
00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:30.610
- Everybody.

684
00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:31.443
She was hot.

685
00:33:31.443 --> 00:33:32.470
Who would say no to her?

686
00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.290
Look. I know deep down inside.
you're not surprised at all.

687
00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:39.333
You have to understand it
had nothing to do with you.

688
00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:43.308
Look. for what it's worth.

689
00:33:43.308 --> 00:33:45.823
I still hear her laughter all the time.

690
00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:47.990
I loved her. too. man.

691
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:50.473
I just wasn't fool enough to
think that I could own her.

692
00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:52.970
- Go fuck yourself.

693
00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:53.803
- Go cool off.

694
00:33:53.803 --> 00:33:55.728
- Go fuck yourself.

695
00:33:55.728 --> 00:33:58.895
(soft dramatic music)

696
00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.350
When you say everybody.

697
00:34:07.329 --> 00:34:08.329
- Everybody.

698
00:34:09.373 --> 00:34:11.572
Nobody talked about it
but it wasn't a secret.

699
00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.263
Sorry man.

700
00:34:16.263 --> 00:34:19.429
(soft dramatic music)

701
00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:13.743
(dramatic music continues)

702
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:50.670
(phone ringing)
(soft dramatic music)

703
00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:52.700
- Mr. Porter.

704
00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:55.470
Mr. Porter. I don't
know if you remember me.

705
00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:57.313
My name is Nick Angers.

706
00:36:01.807 --> 00:36:02.640
We have to talk.

707
00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:22.050
- Would you like to sit down
or would you rather walk?

708
00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:24.200
I prefer if we sit here
if I can be honest.

709
00:36:37.407 --> 00:36:39.913
- Did you kill her
because she preferred me?

710
00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:42.450
- Funny.

711
00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:44.010
That was gonna be my line.

712
00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:46.053
But it turns out. you didn't do it.

713
00:36:47.098 --> 00:36:48.633
Do you have any leads?

714
00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:51.920
- What bothers me the most
is that you don't even try

715
00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:54.303
to deny that you groomed
her since like that what?

716
00:36:54.303 --> 00:36:56.150
Middle school?

717
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:57.680
- The cats out of the bag already.

718
00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.670
I mean. are you really gonna judge me

719
00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:01.230
for liking the same girl you

720
00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:03.510
and the whole damn school had a crush on?

721
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:04.890
- She could've been your daughter.

722
00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:06.710
- But she wasn't.

723
00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:09.240
And I loved her in ways
you can't even imagine yet

724
00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:11.043
because you're young and stupid.

725
00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:14.470
She enjoyed my company.

726
00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:15.840
Can you say the same?

727
00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:17.847
- Apparently a lot of people can.

728
00:37:17.847 --> 00:37:18.743
- Not really.

729
00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:27.480
- I think she dumped you
and you fucking lost it.

730
00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:29.433
- I hated you so much back then.

731
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:34.610
But now. I just feel bad for you.

732
00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:35.810
You lost everything.

733
00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:38.713
Gwen. your freedom. your future.

734
00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.667
- Gotta roll with the punches. man.

735
00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:46.140
- We want the same thing. Nick.

736
00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:48.940
We need to work together if
we're gonna find our killer.

737
00:37:51.408 --> 00:37:52.900
- All right.

738
00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:54.703
What do you know?

739
00:37:55.673 --> 00:37:59.210
- Well that last year. she
was experimenting a lot.

740
00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:02.720
Started liking girls.
but it wasn't enough.

741
00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:06.036
- Yeah. she wanted kids.

742
00:38:06.036 --> 00:38:08.782
- I thought she was too young.

743
00:38:08.782 --> 00:38:10.323
- I told her I was too young.

744
00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:14.510
- That's why I think
the killer was a girl.

745
00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:18.300
Gwen was probably actively
trying to get pregnant

746
00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:20.350
and when the girl found out. she lost it.

747
00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:23.630
- Okay. what makes you say that?

748
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:25.440
- The guys Gwen got with were trash.

749
00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.640
Her girl must've been offended.

750
00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:29.140
When she found out Gwen wanted one

751
00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:32.483
of these guys to knock
her up. that was it.

752
00:38:35.798 --> 00:38:37.800
- You know. Gwen was with a lot of people.

753
00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:39.290
I think anybody could've done it.

754
00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:40.860
- Not anybody.

755
00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:42.360
Only one who really loved her.

756
00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:47.670
- Well that brings it
back to you. doesn't it?

757
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:48.503
Apparently.

758
00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:53.253
- What about Katie Morrison?

759
00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:55.970
They were an item.

760
00:38:57.730 --> 00:39:02.640
- I could see that. but
Katie's not the violent type.

761
00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.373
- Anybody can be the violent type.

762
00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:08.100
But what do we have to lose?

763
00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:10.113
Let's find her and ask her.

764
00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:14.630
- I never said I trusted you. man.

765
00:39:16.917 --> 00:39:19.400
- You know. the way I look at it is this.

766
00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:22.000
You haven't killed me because either A.

767
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.853
you don't have it in you. or
B. you think I didn't do it.

768
00:39:27.619 --> 00:39:29.702
- The answer's B for now.

769
00:39:33.307 --> 00:39:34.973
- I'm gonna go with C.

770
00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:37.767
All of the above.

771
00:39:38.764 --> 00:39:41.931
(soft dramatic music)

772
00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:25.320
- What?

773
00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:27.290
You waiting for me to apologize

774
00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:30.797
for calling you out on something you did?

775
00:40:30.797 --> 00:40:32.983
- You could've texted me
saying that you were coming.

776
00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:35.390
My girl's sleeping.

777
00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:42.810
Did I tell you I managed to
set up your meeting for Monday?

778
00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:43.810
- The job interview?

779
00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:46.493
Wait. dude.

780
00:40:46.493 --> 00:40:47.326
It is Saturday.

781
00:40:47.326 --> 00:40:49.197
When the fuck were you gonna tell me?

782
00:40:49.197 --> 00:40:50.043
- I just did.

783
00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:51.903
- Gee. thanks.

784
00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:54.783
You busy?

785
00:40:56.386 --> 00:40:57.886
Need your help with something.

786
00:40:58.880 --> 00:40:59.723
- With what?

787
00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:02.398
- I gotta go talk to somebody.

788
00:41:02.398 --> 00:41:03.698
I don't wanna do it alone.

789
00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:06.940
- Are you for real?

790
00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:08.820
Are we in some kind of trouble?

791
00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:09.653
- Probably.

792
00:41:12.068 --> 00:41:12.901
- Dammit. Nick.

793
00:41:12.901 --> 00:41:14.692
Why you always try to get me involved?

794
00:41:14.692 --> 00:41:16.213
- You're the only friend I have. man.

795
00:41:18.228 --> 00:41:21.540
It's not like you have any
special skills or anything so.

796
00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:22.403
- Fuck you.

797
00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:25.937
Where we going?

798
00:41:25.937 --> 00:41:28.604
(ominous music)

799
00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:38.406
Do I need to look tough like
I'm about to beat him up?

800
00:41:38.406 --> 00:41:40.510
- Man. just you know. watch my back.

801
00:41:44.324 --> 00:41:46.890
- I don't think he can hear that.

802
00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:47.723
- He's out.

803
00:41:47.723 --> 00:41:48.693
I'm just checking.

804
00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:52.883
For hair.

805
00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:58.876
- Gotta be kidding me.

806
00:41:58.876 --> 00:42:01.543
(ominous music)

807
00:42:33.601 --> 00:42:35.031
- I just wanna talk to him.

808
00:42:35.031 --> 00:42:37.307
I don't wanna go alone.

809
00:42:37.307 --> 00:42:40.593
- Man. help me look so we
can get out of here faster.

810
00:42:41.648 --> 00:42:44.140
- What are we looking for?

811
00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:46.320
- A knife or anything related to Gwen.

812
00:42:47.205 --> 00:42:50.205
(suspenseful music)

813
00:43:37.474 --> 00:43:38.870
- Do you remember Ryan Root?

814
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:40.723
Lanky guy from high school?

815
00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:43.363
- Rings a bell.

816
00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:46.273
- Quite bit of a jerk.

817
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:50.250
He got better and kept in touch.

818
00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:52.013
- Julian. what does this
have to do with anything?

819
00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:54.397
- He went missing.

820
00:43:54.397 --> 00:43:57.397
(suspenseful music)

821
00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:08.580
We should read that somewhere else.

822
00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:11.580
(suspenseful music)

823
00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:22.450
- Hey. I looked at the list

824
00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:23.748
of names you told me and they say-

825
00:44:23.748 --> 00:44:25.310
- Missing.

826
00:44:25.310 --> 00:44:27.860
- Why'd you make me look
it up if you already knew?

827
00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:29.900
- Just found out.

828
00:44:31.967 --> 00:44:33.710
- Where did you find this?

829
00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:34.760
- Mr. Porter's trash.

830
00:44:35.661 --> 00:44:36.494
What?

831
00:44:36.494 --> 00:44:38.072
His door was open.

832
00:44:38.072 --> 00:44:41.072
(suspenseful music)

833
00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:00.460
- These files are very detailed.

834
00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:02.213
- Yeah. he likes doing his homework.

835
00:45:03.490 --> 00:45:04.351
- Nick.

836
00:45:04.351 --> 00:45:06.020
Nick. these are his trophies.

837
00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:07.890
He's gonna notice that somebody took them.

838
00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:08.760
- Done.

839
00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:10.443
Let's just see what we can find.

840
00:45:11.591 --> 00:45:14.591
(suspenseful music)

841
00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:21.593
- Everyone that loved her died.

842
00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:24.350
- Just to cover all the bases.

843
00:45:24.350 --> 00:45:25.183
- What?

844
00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:28.931
- Julian was fucking Gwen.

845
00:45:28.931 --> 00:45:30.931
Julian was fucking Gwen.

846
00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:35.340
- Your friend Julian?

847
00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:36.560
- Yeah.

848
00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:38.061
Julian Hansen.

849
00:45:38.061 --> 00:45:41.061
(suspenseful music)

850
00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:44.743
His name's not in any
of Mr. Porter's files

851
00:45:44.743 --> 00:45:47.073
and he wasn't in any of the
police reports either so.

852
00:45:49.434 --> 00:45:51.203
- How did you find this out?

853
00:45:51.203 --> 00:45:52.743
I mean. did he tell you?

854
00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:54.630
- Don't worry about it. kid.

855
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:55.493
I got my ways.

856
00:45:58.460 --> 00:45:59.293
- Okay well.

857
00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:01.670
Let's not jump to any conclusions.

858
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:03.640
So far Mr. Porter is
still our main suspect.

859
00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:06.124
Don't tell anything else to Julian.

860
00:46:06.124 --> 00:46:07.593
- Hey. you know Katie Morrison?

861
00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:10.387
- What about her?

862
00:46:11.355 --> 00:46:12.911
- I mean. she was Gwen's best friend.

863
00:46:12.911 --> 00:46:13.744
You know-

864
00:46:13.744 --> 00:46:14.977
- She's missing. too.

865
00:46:14.977 --> 00:46:17.977
(suspenseful music)

866
00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:21.618
- She disappeared two months
after Gwen got killed.

867
00:46:21.618 --> 00:46:22.451
- Yeah.

868
00:46:22.451 --> 00:46:23.990
And everybody else went missing

869
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:26.370
within a six month period three years ago.

870
00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:28.030
- So Porter killed them.

871
00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:29.640
- Yeah. there are two types of killers

872
00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:30.540
that leave a body behind.

873
00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:33.083
The ones that wanna make a
statement and the stupid ones.

874
00:46:33.083 --> 00:46:35.585
This one didn't wanna leave a trace.

875
00:46:35.585 --> 00:46:36.769
- Yeah. Porter disappeared-

876
00:46:36.769 --> 00:46:39.670
- He kept the flyers as trophies

877
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:40.910
because they're not real evidence.

878
00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:43.523
- That still leaves Julian and Katie.

879
00:46:45.209 --> 00:46:46.623
- Then Katie is in hiding?

880
00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:52.083
- I think Katie could be Gwen's killer.

881
00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:54.370
- Okay. stop it.

882
00:46:54.370 --> 00:46:56.200
You're starting to lose perspective here.

883
00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:57.700
Yeah. Katie is a loose end. true.

884
00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:00.270
but everything else points to Mr. Porter.

885
00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:01.230
I mean. look.

886
00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:03.021
He probably tracked down all the people.

887
00:47:03.021 --> 00:47:04.850
all the guys that were close to Gwen

888
00:47:04.850 --> 00:47:08.260
and well. now they're missing.

889
00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:10.390
- Look man. I don't know.

890
00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:13.746
Anyway you slice it. I just
don't see Porter killing Gwen.

891
00:47:13.746 --> 00:47:16.746
(suspenseful music)

892
00:47:18.512 --> 00:47:21.179
- You talked to him. didn't you?

893
00:47:22.947 --> 00:47:24.170
- It was the only lead that we had.

894
00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:26.480
- Dammit. Nick. and
now he got in your head

895
00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:27.650
and you're sympathizing with him

896
00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:29.800
and you can't see things objectively.

897
00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:31.030
- Porter may have killed these guys.

898
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:32.280
Yeah okay. sure.

899
00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:33.560
Fuck it. fine.

900
00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:35.763
I just do not think that he killed Gwen.

901
00:47:35.763 --> 00:47:37.213
I think somebody else did it.

902
00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:39.143
- Don't think so.

903
00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:47.463
- Well then. see what else
you can find about Katie.

904
00:47:50.098 --> 00:47:51.622
- I'll do it tomorrow.

905
00:47:51.622 --> 00:47:53.037
I'm on my way out.

906
00:48:02.481 --> 00:48:06.731
- I'm not sure why we go
out when you're in a mood.

907
00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:09.660
- Please don't start. babe.

908
00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:12.934
With work and school and
Nick. I have a lot on my plate

909
00:48:12.934 --> 00:48:15.020
and it's giving me a lot of anxiety.

910
00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:16.420
- Tell you what.

911
00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:18.220
I'm gonna give you a nice. little massage.

912
00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:20.223
help you relax. and then we're gonna see

913
00:48:20.223 --> 00:48:22.193
if you're feeling a little sexy later.

914
00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:25.890
- And you say I'm the manipulative one.

915
00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:38.510
- Nick is not like how
I imagined him at all.

916
00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:39.850
He seems pretty down to earth.

917
00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:41.130
- Babe.

918
00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:43.040
- When you think about
it. he could be the hero

919
00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:46.240
that comes back from prison
and avenges his girlfriend.

920
00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:49.919
Like the movie "The Crow". remember?

921
00:48:49.919 --> 00:48:51.680
- First of all. the guy from "The Crow"

922
00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:52.750
comes back from the dead.

923
00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:54.810
And second of all. Nick does not qualify

924
00:48:54.810 --> 00:48:55.920
as any kind of hero.

925
00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:58.080
He's never had any long term goals.

926
00:48:58.080 --> 00:48:59.860
- He seems pretty determined to find out

927
00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:01.970
what happened to his girl.

928
00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:02.803
- Oh yeah?

929
00:49:02.803 --> 00:49:04.240
Did you guys talk about that?

930
00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:05.570
- No.

931
00:49:05.570 --> 00:49:08.530
He said that apparently
it'll make you happy.

932
00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:09.940
- How would he know?

933
00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:10.853
- Really. babe?

934
00:49:11.961 --> 00:49:12.794
- I'm just saying.

935
00:49:12.794 --> 00:49:14.120
It's not like I tell him things like that.

936
00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:15.480
It's personal.

937
00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:16.600
- Are you upset?

938
00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:18.020
- No.

939
00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:18.853
Maybe.

940
00:49:18.853 --> 00:49:20.133
You like him too much.

941
00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:24.830
- I'm not Gwen. okay.

942
00:49:24.830 --> 00:49:26.477
I won't betray you like she did.

943
00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:29.680
- How do you know?

944
00:49:31.037 --> 00:49:33.787
- Has anyone ever told you
that you might be psychotic?

945
00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:38.640
- Is that your professional
opinion. Dr. Lee?

946
00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.690
- Well. that's just a theory.

947
00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:42.560
So far you haven't shown disregard

948
00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:45.610
for morality so that's a plus.

949
00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:49.783
but you also don't seem to be
very empathetic towards anyone

950
00:49:50.665 --> 00:49:53.313
so that makes me wonder sometimes.

951
00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:56.000
- You know what I'm thinking?

952
00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:58.610
- Is that when you decide work means

953
00:49:58.610 --> 00:50:00.810
more fun than hanging with me?

954
00:50:00.810 --> 00:50:03.700
- Not all psychopaths are serial killers.

955
00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:06.745
They might just need one less
justification to become one.

956
00:50:06.745 --> 00:50:07.870
Imagine this.

957
00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:11.490
Imagine you have functional
psychopath. a high achiever.

958
00:50:11.490 --> 00:50:13.510
and for some reason they kill somebody.

959
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:14.910
- A passion crime?

960
00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:16.790
- I was thinking more
self defense but yeah.

961
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:18.140
A passion crime works. too.

962
00:50:19.090 --> 00:50:20.650
And there are no consequences.

963
00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:23.150
They kill someone and
nothing happens to them.

964
00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:24.460
- That would confirm the idea

965
00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:26.340
that they're involved in society.

966
00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:28.263
- Right and justify their behavior.

967
00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:31.170
- Nick is very charming.
so I wouldn't be surprised.

968
00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:33.310
- No. I was actually talking
about Professor Rossi.

969
00:50:33.310 --> 00:50:34.860
Can we leave Nick out of this?

970
00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:37.407
Honestly. can we just leave
him out of everything?

971
00:50:37.407 --> 00:50:42.370
- Or we can just stop talking at all?

972
00:50:42.370 --> 00:50:43.203
- Stop.

973
00:50:43.203 --> 00:50:45.280
Okay. I should be focusing

974
00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:48.020
on Professor Rossi instead of Nick.

975
00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:49.173
- And we lost her.

976
00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:52.880
- This is the premise
I needed for my book.

977
00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:56.040
Passion crimes is the
ongoing obsession of love.

978
00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:57.400
- Night. boo.

979
00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:01.000
Don't forget to tuck me
in when you go to sleep.

980
00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:05.113
Before I pass out.

981
00:51:06.810 --> 00:51:07.770
I love you tons.

982
00:51:08.952 --> 00:51:09.785
- Okay.

983
00:51:10.727 --> 00:51:13.894
(soft dramatic music)

984
00:52:10.991 --> 00:52:14.574
(dramatic music continues)

985
00:52:33.202 --> 00:52:36.023
(phone beeping)

986
00:52:36.023 --> 00:52:39.190
(soft dramatic music)

987
00:52:58.266 --> 00:53:02.153
Thank you for this
opportunity. Miss Perkins.

988
00:53:02.153 --> 00:53:07.153
Thank you for this
opportunity. Miss Perkins.

989
00:53:07.273 --> 00:53:10.088
Thank you for the
opportunity. Miss Perkins.

990
00:53:10.088 --> 00:53:12.733
(soft dramatic music)

991
00:53:12.733 --> 00:53:15.263
Thank you for the
opportunity. Miss Perkins.

992
00:53:16.944 --> 00:53:19.623
Thank you for the
opportunity. Miss Perkins.

993
00:53:22.395 --> 00:53:23.228
Oh no.

994
00:53:23.228 --> 00:53:24.773
Thank you for the
opportunity. Miss Perkins.

995
00:53:25.646 --> 00:53:28.813
(soft dramatic music)

996
00:53:43.050 --> 00:53:45.400
- Giancarlo Camporrosso.

997
00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:48.610
- You better not use any of
my articles in your project.

998
00:53:48.610 --> 00:53:51.777
(soft dramatic music)

999
00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:55.340
- Why the pseudo name?

1000
00:53:57.410 --> 00:54:00.810
- Those are just ideas
I don't wanna explain.

1001
00:54:00.810 --> 00:54:03.793
Helps me articulate my thoughts
regardless of the readers.

1002
00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:13.223
- You're writing a book
about my brother's case.

1003
00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:16.560
- No. I'm writing a book
and your brother's case

1004
00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:18.173
just happens to be a part of it.

1005
00:54:19.090 --> 00:54:20.650
Did you just figure that out?

1006
00:54:20.650 --> 00:54:22.540
- Yeah. I thought you were helping me

1007
00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:23.980
out of academic interest.

1008
00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:26.370
- That is why I'm helping you.

1009
00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:28.250
Your brother's case
just happens to be part

1010
00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:30.453
of a much. much bigger subject matter.

1011
00:54:33.970 --> 00:54:34.913
- Which is?

1012
00:54:36.850 --> 00:54:37.970
- You write your book.

1013
00:54:37.970 --> 00:54:38.803
I'll write mine.

1014
00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:45.473
- I love the one where you talk

1015
00:54:45.473 --> 00:54:47.103
about love being like a prison.

1016
00:54:48.493 --> 00:54:49.783
It was so spot on.

1017
00:54:51.490 --> 00:54:54.840
- In order for it to be love.
there has to be obsession so.

1018
00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:57.193
- Few people get to experience real love.

1019
00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:02.263
I did once.

1020
00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:06.360
I loved this girl so much

1021
00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:08.260
that I completely forgot about myself.

1022
00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:12.090
It was beautiful.

1023
00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:15.043
And terrible.

1024
00:55:16.032 --> 00:55:16.932
- What did you do?

1025
00:55:22.610 --> 00:55:23.827
- I had to let her go.

1026
00:55:27.330 --> 00:55:30.433
- It truly is beautiful and terrible.

1027
00:55:32.198 --> 00:55:34.950
It only gets worse when she's not around.

1028
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:38.173
It's like having your
chest ripped open forever.

1029
00:55:39.035 --> 00:55:41.035
- Time heals everything.

1030
00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:44.763
- The stump may heal but
the arm doesn't grow back.

1031
00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:48.200
How can you replace the irreplaceable?

1032
00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:49.613
- Why would you?

1033
00:55:49.613 --> 00:55:51.260
- To stop the pain.

1034
00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:53.263
- How far would you go to stop the pain?

1035
00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:55.433
- Is this for your project?

1036
00:55:55.433 --> 00:55:57.827
What is it you really want from me?

1037
00:55:57.827 --> 00:56:00.494
(ominous music)

1038
00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:04.700
- Nick isn't much of
an interesting subject

1039
00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:06.270
if I'm being honest.

1040
00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:07.970
- And you think I am?

1041
00:56:07.970 --> 00:56:10.943
- You are the most interesting
person I have ever met.

1042
00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:13.860
Everything clicked once
I read your articles.

1043
00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:16.170
Okay. I've been writing nonstop.

1044
00:56:16.170 --> 00:56:17.880
- I should warn you not to mention me

1045
00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:19.393
in your project or your book.

1046
00:56:21.830 --> 00:56:24.023
As your advisor. it's my obligation.

1047
00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:30.013
- Understood.

1048
00:56:31.509 --> 00:56:34.720
I just thought I could help you move on.

1049
00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:36.663
- At my age. there is no moving on.

1050
00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:38.763
Only cleaning up.

1051
00:56:40.210 --> 00:56:41.310
- That explains a lot.

1052
00:56:50.388 --> 00:56:51.721
I almost forgot.

1053
00:56:55.610 --> 00:56:57.490
Julian Hansen.

1054
00:56:57.490 --> 00:56:59.680
Apparently he was one of Gwen's lovers.

1055
00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:00.930
I missed him the first time around.

1056
00:57:00.930 --> 00:57:02.660
Didn't get to talk to him.

1057
00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:04.100
- How did you miss him?

1058
00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:05.680
- He's Nick's best friend.

1059
00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:07.870
He was right in front of me so.

1060
00:57:07.870 --> 00:57:09.570
But hopefully I'll talk to him soon.

1061
00:57:09.570 --> 00:57:10.503
Maybe this week.

1062
00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:12.893
- Another suspect.

1063
00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:16.990
- Just another one of her men.

1064
00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:17.823
- Well.

1065
00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:19.910
Go get him.

1066
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:22.910
(suspenseful music)

1067
00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:35.593
- Hey. honey.

1068
00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:40.593
Are you okay?

1069
00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:47.280
- When did I fuck it all up?

1070
00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:53.770
I had it all. right?

1071
00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:56.940
And then poof. I'm in prison.

1072
00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:58.190
Nobody comes to visit me.

1073
00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:02.333
- It was a complicated case.

1074
00:58:05.038 --> 00:58:06.423
- Complicated how?

1075
00:58:11.146 --> 00:58:11.979
- Well.

1076
00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:17.370
For instance. it came up during the trial

1077
00:58:19.110 --> 00:58:22.923
that Gwen was how should I say?

1078
00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:26.903
Crazy about boys.

1079
00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:31.503
And some of them were
your so called friends.

1080
00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:36.520
- You never thought to tell me.

1081
00:58:38.050 --> 00:58:38.883
- Why?

1082
00:58:39.973 --> 00:58:42.640
She wasn't serious about any of them

1083
00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:46.490
and it certainly wouldn't
have helped your case.

1084
00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:49.780
It only would've made you feel
worse than you already were.

1085
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:52.810
- You could've saved me so much time. Mom.

1086
00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:58.210
Now I'm trying to pick
up the pieces of my life

1087
00:58:58.210 --> 00:59:00.160
and the only person I have left is you.

1088
00:59:05.350 --> 00:59:07.917
- You were very checked
out during the trial.

1089
00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:11.083
I did my best.

1090
00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:15.593
Anyway.

1091
00:59:16.550 --> 00:59:18.623
Julian got you that job interview today.

1092
00:59:22.490 --> 00:59:23.590
- Wasn't an interview.

1093
00:59:24.890 --> 00:59:27.543
Lady just wanted to see the
ex-con fresh out of jail.

1094
00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:30.270
Made me so fucking angry.

1095
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:33.103
- Did Julian know?

1096
00:59:33.103 --> 00:59:34.353
- I don't know.

1097
00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:36.890
He wasn't there.

1098
00:59:36.890 --> 00:59:38.690
He's not answering his phone either.

1099
00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:47.390
- Maybe you could just
get away for a little bit.

1100
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:48.223
Take a vacation.

1101
00:59:51.130 --> 00:59:55.050
I have some money saved up for
Rianne's graduation present.

1102
00:59:55.050 --> 00:59:56.800
I could easily just-

1103
00:59:56.800 --> 01:00:00.020
- All the money in the world
couldn't help me now. Mom.

1104
01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:02.593
Thanks though.

1105
01:00:03.903 --> 01:00:07.070
(soft dramatic music)

1106
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:16.920
- Long time no see. stranger.

1107
01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:19.251
- Thanks for buying groceries yesterday.

1108
01:00:19.251 --> 01:00:20.084
- Yeah. no problem.

1109
01:00:20.084 --> 01:00:21.560
I figured you were back to double shifting

1110
01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:24.785
trying to make up for your big withdrawal.

1111
01:00:24.785 --> 01:00:26.035
- Please don't.

1112
01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:36.630
Have you spoke to Mariah
about moving in together yet?

1113
01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:39.670
- Mom. I told you we'd talk
about when I finish school.

1114
01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:41.220
Nick can wait that much longer.

1115
01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:44.730
- But you have to remember

1116
01:00:44.730 --> 01:00:47.510
that he needs more help than other people.

1117
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:49.030
He always has.

1118
01:00:49.030 --> 01:00:50.680
He used to have this gate

1119
01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:52.850
that all the other kids laughed at.

1120
01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:54.120
- And he laughed along with them

1121
01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:56.330
because he was too little to understand

1122
01:00:56.330 --> 01:00:58.323
that they were laughing at him.

1123
01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:03.500
I know.

1124
01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:05.193
You told me many times.

1125
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:08.280
- And then you started growing up

1126
01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:10.940
and doing everything on your own.

1127
01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:12.410
- Yup. so you had to bring me down

1128
01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:14.510
to make him feel less inadequate.

1129
01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:18.070
- He is your brother and he needs us.

1130
01:01:18.070 --> 01:01:20.723
Is that too much to ask?

1131
01:01:21.787 --> 01:01:24.553
- Mom. Mariah's waiting for me.

1132
01:01:24.553 --> 01:01:25.743
- Goddammit. Rianne.

1133
01:01:27.938 --> 01:01:30.690
What is it gonna take for
you to care for your brother?

1134
01:01:30.690 --> 01:01:31.790
- Why?

1135
01:01:31.790 --> 01:01:33.658
He's just gonna throw
everything away anyway.

1136
01:01:33.658 --> 01:01:34.491
- We'll help him.

1137
01:01:34.491 --> 01:01:37.252
- People like him can't be helped. Mom.

1138
01:01:37.252 --> 01:01:40.419
(soft dramatic music)

1139
01:02:03.923 --> 01:02:04.756
I'm sorry.

1140
01:02:06.075 --> 01:02:09.242
(soft dramatic music)

1141
01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:28.770
Babe. today's one of those days
where I need our safe space.

1142
01:02:28.770 --> 01:02:30.083
- Who's Katie Morrison?

1143
01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:32.860
- What?

1144
01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:35.740
- You left your email
account open in my computer.

1145
01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:38.130
but it wasn't even your account.

1146
01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:41.310
It was Katie Morrison's
or whoever that is.

1147
01:02:41.310 --> 01:02:43.010
- But you respected the
fact that it wasn't yours

1148
01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:44.830
and you didn't touch anything. right babe?

1149
01:02:44.830 --> 01:02:47.220
- Can you tell me what's going on?

1150
01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:48.480
- Did you touch anything?

1151
01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:49.530
- You don't trust me?

1152
01:02:50.608 --> 01:02:53.608
(suspenseful music)

1153
01:03:04.232 --> 01:03:05.860
- That's just research. Mariah.

1154
01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:06.890
You'd die of boredom.

1155
01:03:06.890 --> 01:03:09.123
- Why don't you let me decide for myself?

1156
01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:12.020
- What are you talking about?

1157
01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:13.943
- Nothing about you is simple. boo.

1158
01:03:15.134 --> 01:03:17.084
but I'm really happy with us right now.

1159
01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:20.750
If this is something that's
gonna change us. please stop.

1160
01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:23.870
- Not everything is about us.

1161
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:26.560
- Anything that happens
to you happens to us.

1162
01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:28.350
Whatever you do. we do.

1163
01:03:28.350 --> 01:03:31.180
- We don't become one
person because we're dating.

1164
01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:32.490
What I do is what I do.

1165
01:03:33.542 --> 01:03:36.709
(soft dramatic music)

1166
01:03:55.150 --> 01:03:57.653
- Love is not just about
what one person feels.

1167
01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:02.181
It's about two people
sharing everything together.

1168
01:04:02.181 --> 01:04:05.348
(soft dramatic music)

1169
01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:12.960
Love is about trust and commitment.

1170
01:04:15.068 --> 01:04:15.901
- I know.

1171
01:04:16.930 --> 01:04:18.894
You taught me that.

1172
01:04:18.894 --> 01:04:22.061
(soft dramatic music)

1173
01:04:47.650 --> 01:04:49.833
I won't let anything change us.

1174
01:05:03.310 --> 01:05:04.890
- Hi.

1175
01:05:04.890 --> 01:05:07.010
I don't know if you remember my name.

1176
01:05:07.010 --> 01:05:08.820
- I know who you are.

1177
01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:10.180
I'm trying to understand
why you didn't text

1178
01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:12.423
before showing up like normal people.

1179
01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:16.063
but you probably got
institutionalized already. right?

1180
01:05:17.090 --> 01:05:17.923
Nevermind.

1181
01:05:17.923 --> 01:05:19.140
What do you want. Nick?

1182
01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:19.973
- May I come in?

1183
01:05:19.973 --> 01:05:20.940
- No.

1184
01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:22.090
Just say what you need.

1185
01:05:23.887 --> 01:05:25.087
- I'm looking for Katie.

1186
01:05:27.218 --> 01:05:28.423
- She's dead.

1187
01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:31.150
- Excuse me.

1188
01:05:31.150 --> 01:05:32.470
- She's dead.

1189
01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:34.940
She went missing in
October eight years ago

1190
01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:36.130
a bit after Gwen was killed.

1191
01:05:36.130 --> 01:05:37.290
You should really do your homework

1192
01:05:37.290 --> 01:05:38.370
before going to people's homes.

1193
01:05:38.370 --> 01:05:40.391
It's kind of wrong to just show up.

1194
01:05:40.391 --> 01:05:42.920
- If she's missing. then
maybe she's still in hiding.

1195
01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:44.110
- Hiding?

1196
01:05:44.110 --> 01:05:45.191
From whom?

1197
01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:47.350
Nobody could've kept her
in a basement too long.

1198
01:05:47.350 --> 01:05:48.950
Katie was like a feral cat.

1199
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:51.510
She would've dug through
anything and anyone to break free

1200
01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:53.380
and then come home to tell me about it.

1201
01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:56.120
- Wouldn't you have heard her come back?

1202
01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:57.680
- The only reason I'm talking to you

1203
01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:59.650
is because I know you didn't kill Gwen.

1204
01:05:59.650 --> 01:06:00.483
Whoever killed Gwen is out and about

1205
01:06:00.483 --> 01:06:02.940
and it's the same bastard
that killed my daughter.

1206
01:06:04.728 --> 01:06:06.336
- Got any theories?

1207
01:06:06.336 --> 01:06:07.410
- The killer was in love with Gwen

1208
01:06:07.410 --> 01:06:08.990
and killed her when he found
out she was with Katie.

1209
01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:11.323
Then killed Katie out of jealously.

1210
01:06:12.333 --> 01:06:16.700
Honestly. I think you were
probably more of a cover for Gwen

1211
01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:18.200
to look respectable. you know.

1212
01:06:20.039 --> 01:06:21.760
- You know. everybody keeps telling me

1213
01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:23.713
the killer was involved with Gwen. too.

1214
01:06:24.632 --> 01:06:25.465
- Of course.

1215
01:06:25.465 --> 01:06:27.610
Wasn't she stabbed 27 times?

1216
01:06:27.610 --> 01:06:30.680
That's someone that was
hurting very. very badly.

1217
01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:32.330
If you hadn't been in prison
when Katie went missing.

1218
01:06:32.330 --> 01:06:33.930
I would've thought of you first.

1219
01:06:35.032 --> 01:06:36.440
- Got anybody else in mind?

1220
01:06:38.012 --> 01:06:40.273
- I wasn't that involved in their lives.

1221
01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:43.090
All this thinking happened later.

1222
01:06:44.550 --> 01:06:46.227
- You keep saying he.

1223
01:06:46.227 --> 01:06:47.870
What if it's a she?

1224
01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:48.840
- He. she. it.

1225
01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:50.350
It doesn't matter.

1226
01:06:50.350 --> 01:06:53.210
Someone with two hands and a broken heart.

1227
01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:55.060
Anyway. I have things to do.

1228
01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:56.068
Sorry.

1229
01:06:56.068 --> 01:06:56.985
- Go 'head.

1230
01:06:58.155 --> 01:07:00.530
- I meant I'm sorry you went to prison.

1231
01:07:00.530 --> 01:07:03.010
I always thought you were a good guy.

1232
01:07:03.010 --> 01:07:04.931
A bit dim but good.

1233
01:07:04.931 --> 01:07:08.098
(soft dramatic music)

1234
01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:35.753
- Katie's dead.

1235
01:07:38.003 --> 01:07:39.953
- I thought you said she was in hiding.

1236
01:07:44.690 --> 01:07:47.410
- I emailed her and someone replied.

1237
01:07:47.410 --> 01:07:49.873
but I don't think it was her actually.

1238
01:07:49.873 --> 01:07:51.593
I actually think it's Julian.

1239
01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:56.130
- Wait. what?

1240
01:07:56.130 --> 01:07:56.963
- Here's my theory.

1241
01:07:56.963 --> 01:07:58.520
So.

1242
01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:00.427
Porter. he kills all the other ones

1243
01:08:00.427 --> 01:08:01.400
out of jealously or spite.

1244
01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:02.320
We know that.

1245
01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:04.820
- Can't prove it but agreed.

1246
01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:05.653
- Okay.

1247
01:08:05.653 --> 01:08:10.653
So what if Julian killed
Gwen and then he kills Katie?

1248
01:08:10.842 --> 01:08:12.740
- Why would he do that?

1249
01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:14.030
Okay. he knew all along that Gwen

1250
01:08:14.030 --> 01:08:15.646
was getting with other people.

1251
01:08:15.646 --> 01:08:16.478
I mean. you were her boyfriend

1252
01:08:16.478 --> 01:08:18.521
and he didn't try and kill you.

1253
01:08:18.521 --> 01:08:19.990
- I thought about it a lot

1254
01:08:19.990 --> 01:08:22.920
and I think it was
because Katie is a girl.

1255
01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:25.550
- He felt threatened by one
girl than a bunch of guys?

1256
01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:27.112
- It's just one girl. right?

1257
01:08:27.112 --> 01:08:28.010
I mean. she's like thee girl.

1258
01:08:28.010 --> 01:08:31.250
Like the only girl that
Gwen was ever with.

1259
01:08:31.250 --> 01:08:32.500
That's gotta make her special.

1260
01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:37.500
- I don't think it makes her
special. but I see your point.

1261
01:08:39.830 --> 01:08:44.280
So. Julian hacked Katie's
email to get you offtrack?

1262
01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:45.680
- To push me towards Porter.

1263
01:08:48.309 --> 01:08:50.017
- What are you gonna do?

1264
01:08:54.050 --> 01:08:55.300
- I don't know.

1265
01:08:56.589 --> 01:08:59.451
You know. Julian hasn't
responded to me in like two days.

1266
01:08:59.451 --> 01:09:01.951
I actually think that he's
onto us being onto him.

1267
01:09:03.486 --> 01:09:06.130
- Maybe we should leave it here.

1268
01:09:06.130 --> 01:09:08.100
I mean. I have school picking up

1269
01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:09.733
and you gotta get a job so.

1270
01:09:10.590 --> 01:09:11.590
- Detective quitter.

1271
01:09:12.919 --> 01:09:15.559
Throwing in the towel already. huh?

1272
01:09:15.559 --> 01:09:17.550
- Take a step back. Nick.

1273
01:09:17.550 --> 01:09:20.880
You're twisting your logic
to see anything as evidence.

1274
01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:22.840
Why do you wanna stay trapped in the past?

1275
01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:23.673
- It's not about me. kid.

1276
01:09:23.673 --> 01:09:24.505
- Maybe it should be.

1277
01:09:26.984 --> 01:09:30.023
You already gave up
nine years of your life.

1278
01:09:31.057 --> 01:09:33.700
How many more are you willing to put in?

1279
01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:36.040
- You don't have to help
me if you don't want to.

1280
01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:38.663
- Thank you for mansplaining the obvious.

1281
01:09:38.663 --> 01:09:41.830
(soft dramatic music)

1282
01:09:47.853 --> 01:09:48.687
- Rianne.

1283
01:09:52.030 --> 01:09:54.112
I was in prison for nine years.

1284
01:09:57.490 --> 01:10:00.440
I only got three small scars though.

1285
01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:01.400
Do you know how crazy that is?

1286
01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:03.343
Do you have any idea how rare?

1287
01:10:05.690 --> 01:10:08.253
I was on like all the fucking time.

1288
01:10:09.911 --> 01:10:11.893
I wanted to die a lot like everyday.

1289
01:10:14.930 --> 01:10:16.690
Think about this.

1290
01:10:16.690 --> 01:10:19.389
Thinking about this is what kept me going.

1291
01:10:19.389 --> 01:10:21.490
This is the biggest part of a new me. man.

1292
01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:23.952
You gotta take it or leave it.

1293
01:10:26.050 --> 01:10:27.870
You know. it's not that
I don't wanna stop. man.

1294
01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:29.520
It's not that I don't wanna stop.

1295
01:10:30.963 --> 01:10:31.860
I would love to stop.

1296
01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:32.960
I can't.

1297
01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:33.793
I can't.

1298
01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:36.263
- What if it is true?

1299
01:10:37.632 --> 01:10:39.520
What are you gonna do to Julian?

1300
01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:40.853
Don't answer that.

1301
01:10:42.570 --> 01:10:43.520
- I gotta find him.

1302
01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:49.282
- I can't help you be this new person.

1303
01:10:51.490 --> 01:10:52.883
It's not good for you.

1304
01:10:57.330 --> 01:10:58.610
- That's fine.

1305
01:10:58.610 --> 01:10:59.893
That's fine then.

1306
01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:03.433
You can go back to playing
with your fucking dolls.

1307
01:11:03.433 --> 01:11:04.943
I don't give a shit. man.

1308
01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:10.094
- Fine. I'll do that.

1309
01:11:10.094 --> 01:11:11.907
- You do that then.

1310
01:11:11.907 --> 01:11:14.907
(suspenseful music)

1311
01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:29.990
- Wakey. wakey.

1312
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:31.297
- Five more minutes.

1313
01:11:32.133 --> 01:11:34.460
- You can spend all day
here for all I care.

1314
01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:35.883
but don't be late for class.

1315
01:11:37.132 --> 01:11:39.090
- I don't care if I'm late for class.

1316
01:11:39.090 --> 01:11:40.021
- Okay.

1317
01:11:40.021 --> 01:11:40.973
Gotta go.

1318
01:11:40.973 --> 01:11:41.806
Have a good one.

1319
01:11:41.806 --> 01:11:43.050
- All right. babe.

1320
01:11:43.050 --> 01:11:43.883
See you tonight.

1321
01:11:45.130 --> 01:11:47.952
- Boo. if you're spending
all your time here.

1322
01:11:47.952 --> 01:11:50.032
why don't we make it official?

1323
01:11:51.190 --> 01:11:53.543
I'm not talking about the proposal.

1324
01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:56.520
Just move in officially.

1325
01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:58.230
That way you'll be closer to school.

1326
01:11:58.230 --> 01:11:59.940
we get to spend all day together.

1327
01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:01.889
and you won't see your brother anymore.

1328
01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:06.620
- If I move out. there's no going back.

1329
01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:08.420
- So you don't think it'll work out?

1330
01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:11.362
- That's not what I said.

1331
01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:14.200
- I know.

1332
01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:15.866
Just think about it.

1333
01:12:15.866 --> 01:12:16.699
Gotta go.

1334
01:12:22.189 --> 01:12:24.100
I love you tons.

1335
01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:25.441
- Okay.

1336
01:12:25.441 --> 01:12:28.608
(soft dramatic music)

1337
01:12:46.305 --> 01:12:49.360
A love obsession surviving
the object of affection.

1338
01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:50.193
- I got your email.

1339
01:12:50.193 --> 01:12:51.026
Sit down.

1340
01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:55.280
Was it something I said
the last time we spoke?

1341
01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:56.370
- Yes.

1342
01:12:56.370 --> 01:12:58.343
Everything clicked the
last time we talked.

1343
01:12:58.343 --> 01:13:00.490
Okay. I thought that a passion crime

1344
01:13:00.490 --> 01:13:02.469
could reveal a part of a
person that was unknown to them

1345
01:13:02.469 --> 01:13:04.490
and once that potential was unlocked.

1346
01:13:04.490 --> 01:13:06.163
it could not be put away.

1347
01:13:06.163 --> 01:13:07.920
- But now you think that obsession

1348
01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:09.480
is helping to keep the door open.

1349
01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:10.313
- Right.

1350
01:13:10.313 --> 01:13:14.130
And when the obsession is
gone. the door can be closed.

1351
01:13:14.130 --> 01:13:16.610
- But now the person
is aware of that power.

1352
01:13:16.610 --> 01:13:18.469
The power that allowed them to correct

1353
01:13:18.469 --> 01:13:19.580
all the wrongs done to them.

1354
01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:21.530
Why would they give it up?

1355
01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:25.059
- To not hurt the people around them.

1356
01:13:25.059 --> 01:13:26.180
The other people they love.

1357
01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:28.620
- Yet a crime has been committed.

1358
01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:30.290
Gears have been put in motion.

1359
01:13:30.290 --> 01:13:32.520
And consequences will come.

1360
01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:34.580
- Okay. a passion crime is just that.

1361
01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:36.830
A blinding moment of pain and anger.

1362
01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:38.090
but after that the obsession

1363
01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:40.433
just feeds itself with more vengeance.

1364
01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:43.950
- What if the obsession is
helping to restore balance?

1365
01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:45.280
- To the same things that twist it

1366
01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:46.559
and corrupt it originally?

1367
01:13:46.559 --> 01:13:48.469
- Love is the obsession.

1368
01:13:48.469 --> 01:13:50.020
Otherwise it's just friendship.

1369
01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:51.120
Fraternal connection.

1370
01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:54.853
- Love is trust and commitment.

1371
01:13:56.670 --> 01:13:58.830
- Let's say you're correct.

1372
01:13:58.830 --> 01:14:00.480
What are you suggesting?

1373
01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:02.610
How can you prevent the consequences?

1374
01:14:02.610 --> 01:14:05.723
- Maybe it's not about
preventing the consequences.

1375
01:14:07.530 --> 01:14:08.813
but surviving them.

1376
01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:12.653
- And you think you can?

1377
01:14:12.653 --> 01:14:15.820
(soft dramatic music)

1378
01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:28.590
- Yes?

1379
01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:29.880
- Is Julian home?

1380
01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:30.713
- No.

1381
01:14:32.507 --> 01:14:33.993
- Hey. I'm Nick.

1382
01:14:37.696 --> 01:14:40.697
I've been trying to reach
him for like a week.

1383
01:14:40.697 --> 01:14:42.639
I haven't heard back from him.

1384
01:14:42.639 --> 01:14:44.290
- Well. he's going through
something right now.

1385
01:14:44.290 --> 01:14:46.023
so just give him some time.

1386
01:14:48.505 --> 01:14:49.480
- I mean. is this normal?

1387
01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:50.420
Does he just take off for days

1388
01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:52.200
at a time without telling anybody?

1389
01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:53.059
- Yeah. sometimes.

1390
01:14:53.059 --> 01:14:54.690
And he always comes back
feeling a lot better.

1391
01:14:54.690 --> 01:14:57.288
so just give him some space.

1392
01:14:57.288 --> 01:14:58.705
- What's he upset about?

1393
01:14:58.705 --> 01:14:59.930
- That's none of your business.

1394
01:14:59.930 --> 01:15:00.900
- Hey.

1395
01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:02.300
Sorry.

1396
01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:04.452
I'm just really fucking worried about him.

1397
01:15:09.870 --> 01:15:11.910
- He should be coming home soon.

1398
01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:12.743
- How do you know?

1399
01:15:12.743 --> 01:15:13.840
What makes you so sure?

1400
01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:16.440
- Well. he wasn't planning
on leaving for long.

1401
01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:18.627
His car's right outside.

1402
01:15:18.627 --> 01:15:20.245
- Do you have a key?

1403
01:15:20.245 --> 01:15:23.412
(soft dramatic music)

1404
01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:26.493
Hey. man.

1405
01:16:27.469 --> 01:16:29.571
Do you mind taking a look at this. please?

1406
01:16:29.571 --> 01:16:32.737
(soft dramatic music)

1407
01:16:34.753 --> 01:16:37.483
Dude. please look at this.

1408
01:16:40.154 --> 01:16:41.952
- What is this?

1409
01:16:41.952 --> 01:16:44.370
- I found it in Julian's car.

1410
01:16:45.330 --> 01:16:46.780
- Is this a camera?

1411
01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:50.219
- Yeah. he uses it when
he's like driving people.

1412
01:16:50.219 --> 01:16:51.862
- Ew. a creepy recording.

1413
01:16:51.862 --> 01:16:53.075
- Can you just play it?

1414
01:16:53.075 --> 01:16:55.075
- Yeah okay. I'm trying.

1415
01:17:00.942 --> 01:17:02.290
- What's taking so long?

1416
01:17:02.290 --> 01:17:03.782
- It's loading. Nick.

1417
01:17:06.910 --> 01:17:07.983
- Okay. that one.

1418
01:17:07.983 --> 01:17:09.733
That one right there.

1419
01:17:17.384 --> 01:17:20.384
(suspenseful music)

1420
01:17:28.227 --> 01:17:29.443
- [Rianne] Holy shit.

1421
01:17:30.539 --> 01:17:33.313
This could be enough to send him to jail.

1422
01:17:34.318 --> 01:17:36.719
(suspenseful music)

1423
01:17:36.719 --> 01:17:39.577
- [Nick] Why'd he wait until right now?

1424
01:17:39.577 --> 01:17:41.559
- This is exactly what you needed.

1425
01:17:41.559 --> 01:17:44.559
Okay. maybe he's gonna
confess to killing the others.

1426
01:17:44.559 --> 01:17:46.952
- Why'd he wait until I got
out of prison to kill Julian?

1427
01:17:46.952 --> 01:17:50.370
Why'd he wait so many years?

1428
01:17:50.370 --> 01:17:51.202
I don't.

1429
01:17:51.202 --> 01:17:52.090
- Hey. Nick. look.

1430
01:17:52.090 --> 01:17:52.923
Listen to me.

1431
01:17:52.923 --> 01:17:54.250
You have to go to the police.

1432
01:17:59.973 --> 01:18:01.993
- Porter has to die.

1433
01:18:01.993 --> 01:18:05.160
(soft dramatic music)

1434
01:18:08.219 --> 01:18:09.291
- Nick.

1435
01:18:09.291 --> 01:18:12.459
(soft dramatic music)

1436
01:19:26.736 --> 01:19:27.568
You can do this.

1437
01:19:27.568 --> 01:19:29.081
You can do this.

1438
01:19:29.081 --> 01:19:32.248
(soft dramatic music)

1439
01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:35.883
Hey. hey. can you help me?

1440
01:19:37.559 --> 01:19:40.780
I got a flat tire and nobody came

1441
01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:42.933
and I don't know how to take the tire off.

1442
01:19:45.550 --> 01:19:47.930
- Well. if it's just a flat.
it shouldn't be a problem.

1443
01:19:47.930 --> 01:19:49.480
I can change it for you.

1444
01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:50.313
- Thank you.

1445
01:19:50.313 --> 01:19:52.496
Thank you so much.

1446
01:19:52.496 --> 01:19:53.580
- No problem.

1447
01:20:00.559 --> 01:20:02.350
- [Rianne] I'm just getting nervous

1448
01:20:02.350 --> 01:20:03.873
because there's nobody around.

1449
01:20:06.210 --> 01:20:07.400
- Totally.

1450
01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:09.499
I saw some homeless people
camping in the area.

1451
01:20:09.499 --> 01:20:11.260
I mean. that doesn't mean anything but-

1452
01:20:11.260 --> 01:20:13.800
- Yeah. that's what I was talking about.

1453
01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:15.414
- You have a spare?

1454
01:20:15.414 --> 01:20:16.623
- In the trunk.

1455
01:20:19.550 --> 01:20:20.620
- [Katie] Do you live around here?

1456
01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:21.452
- Not really.

1457
01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:24.197
- We met before?

1458
01:20:24.197 --> 01:20:26.760
You look so familiar.

1459
01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:27.743
- I would remember.

1460
01:20:29.405 --> 01:20:32.755
- Well. you are kind of
cute. so maybe that's why.

1461
01:20:32.755 --> 01:20:35.755
(suspenseful music)

1462
01:20:56.002 --> 01:20:58.701
(gun firing)

1463
01:20:58.701 --> 01:21:01.868
(soft dramatic music)

1464
01:21:36.065 --> 01:21:37.282
- Hey boo.

1465
01:21:37.282 --> 01:21:40.450
(soft dramatic music)

1466
01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:47.094
If this is about you moving in-

1467
01:21:47.094 --> 01:21:48.662
- Sh.

1468
01:21:48.662 --> 01:21:51.829
(soft dramatic music)

1469
01:21:59.925 --> 01:22:01.710
- Is everything okay?

1470
01:22:01.710 --> 01:22:05.460
(soft dramatic music)

1471
01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:06.293
- Yeah.

1472
01:22:07.478 --> 01:22:09.431
I just need a minute.

1473
01:22:09.431 --> 01:22:12.598
(soft dramatic music)

1474
01:22:20.330 --> 01:22:22.386
- You sure everything's okay?

1475
01:22:22.386 --> 01:22:25.553
(soft dramatic music)

1476
01:22:33.511 --> 01:22:36.178
(alarm beeping)

1477
01:22:44.689 --> 01:22:47.856
(soft dramatic music)

1478
01:23:11.688 --> 01:23:12.793
- Excuse me.

1479
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:15.323
- Ah. Rianne.

1480
01:23:16.170 --> 01:23:17.300
Good morning.

1481
01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:21.677
If you're looking for Professor
Rossi. he's not in today.

1482
01:23:21.677 --> 01:23:23.197
- How come?

1483
01:23:23.197 --> 01:23:24.450
- I don't know.

1484
01:23:24.450 --> 01:23:26.400
He's always been here earlier than normal

1485
01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:29.410
and today he just wasn't.

1486
01:23:29.410 --> 01:23:31.600
- Did you try calling him?

1487
01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:34.803
- Well. it's more complicated than that.

1488
01:23:34.803 --> 01:23:36.530
- Look. I'm not gonna leave

1489
01:23:36.530 --> 01:23:38.918
until you tell me what's going on.

1490
01:23:38.918 --> 01:23:41.323
Sorry. I'm just being honest.

1491
01:23:44.130 --> 01:23:48.370
- A couple of police
detectives were here earlier.

1492
01:23:48.370 --> 01:23:52.330
Professor Rossi's neighbors
heard gunshots yesterday

1493
01:23:52.330 --> 01:23:53.743
and they called the police.

1494
01:23:54.610 --> 01:23:56.378
When the officers arrived.

1495
01:23:56.378 --> 01:23:58.952
they walked in and found basically-

1496
01:24:00.192 --> 01:24:02.780
- They broken in probably.

1497
01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:05.590
- They walked in and they
found nothing strange

1498
01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:09.869
other than a strong smell of bleach.

1499
01:24:09.869 --> 01:24:11.919
- Like somebody had cleaned up the place.

1500
01:24:12.947 --> 01:24:15.440
- Yes. Rianne. like a crime scene.

1501
01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:17.809
but don't jump to conclusions.

1502
01:24:17.809 --> 01:24:20.030
The officers. they arrived
there fairly quickly.

1503
01:24:20.030 --> 01:24:23.760
so it's hard to imagine
that someone did something

1504
01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:25.790
and then they had time to clean up.

1505
01:24:25.790 --> 01:24:27.930
- What else did the detectives say?

1506
01:24:27.930 --> 01:24:29.193
Any homicide detectives?

1507
01:24:30.077 --> 01:24:32.830
- They were just asking routine questions.

1508
01:24:32.830 --> 01:24:35.330
It's not a missing person case yet.

1509
01:24:35.330 --> 01:24:36.910
- So we're just hoping
that Professor Rossi

1510
01:24:36.910 --> 01:24:39.639
will show up at a later
day. today or tomorrow.

1511
01:24:39.639 --> 01:24:41.663
and just tell us what happened.

1512
01:24:41.663 --> 01:24:42.963
- Pretty much.

1513
01:24:44.327 --> 01:24:47.040
Is there something I could help you with?

1514
01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:48.980
- No. I just I had some questions

1515
01:24:48.980 --> 01:24:51.670
about my senior project. but I can wait.

1516
01:24:51.670 --> 01:24:52.940
I'll check back in tomorrow.

1517
01:24:52.940 --> 01:24:53.773
Thanks.

1518
01:24:53.773 --> 01:24:54.606
- Mm hm.

1519
01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:06.960
- Mom. what are you doing here?

1520
01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:09.580
- I told them I'd work from home today.

1521
01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:12.232
Do you know where your brother is?

1522
01:25:12.232 --> 01:25:13.065
- No.

1523
01:25:13.930 --> 01:25:15.620
I was at Mariah's all day yesterday

1524
01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:18.050
and then I went straight to school.

1525
01:25:18.050 --> 01:25:21.032
- He didn't come home last night.

1526
01:25:21.032 --> 01:25:23.407
- Maybe he's with Julian.

1527
01:25:23.407 --> 01:25:24.702
- No. I don't think so.

1528
01:25:26.130 --> 01:25:28.063
He sent me this text last night.

1529
01:25:29.871 --> 01:25:32.910
I need some time away.

1530
01:25:32.910 --> 01:25:34.410
Don't worry about me.

1531
01:25:34.410 --> 01:25:35.243
Love you.

1532
01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:38.059
Weird. right?

1533
01:25:38.059 --> 01:25:39.577
- No.

1534
01:25:39.577 --> 01:25:41.400
I mean. he has the money you gave him.

1535
01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:43.180
He probably just needs some time off.

1536
01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:46.160
- Yeah. but it just doesn't seem like him.

1537
01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:48.877
- Mom. you just gotta give him some time.

1538
01:25:49.764 --> 01:25:52.916
- I just thought that he
would stay a little longer.

1539
01:25:52.916 --> 01:25:56.083
(soft dramatic music)

1540
01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:20.690
- I'll be at Mariah's if you need me.

1541
01:26:20.690 --> 01:26:22.163
- Are you coming back tonight?

1542
01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:28.666
- I'll see you at dinner.

1543
01:27:05.541 --> 01:27:06.540
- Let's get going.

1544
01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:07.553
- Holy fuck.

1545
01:27:18.068 --> 01:27:20.930
The cops are looking for you.

1546
01:27:20.930 --> 01:27:24.150
- They probably don't even
know where to start yet.

1547
01:27:24.150 --> 01:27:26.553
(soft dramatic music)

1548
01:27:26.553 --> 01:27:28.829
- You set Nick up.

1549
01:27:28.829 --> 01:27:30.130
- You're welcome.

1550
01:27:30.130 --> 01:27:31.360
You wanted to get rid of him.

1551
01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:32.573
I just played along.

1552
01:27:36.110 --> 01:27:37.277
- Where is he?

1553
01:27:38.258 --> 01:27:41.210
- Might wanna get rid of that video.

1554
01:27:41.210 --> 01:27:43.532
It could link you to some bad mojo.

1555
01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:48.100
- You were waiting for him.

1556
01:27:48.100 --> 01:27:51.021
That's why the place was
clean when the cops arrived.

1557
01:27:51.021 --> 01:27:53.433
- Glad to see your
education wasn't wasted.

1558
01:27:57.018 --> 01:27:58.969
- What happens next?

1559
01:27:58.969 --> 01:28:00.884
- We draw Katie out.

1560
01:28:00.884 --> 01:28:01.717
- We?

1561
01:28:02.647 --> 01:28:04.860
- Just a figure of speech.

1562
01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:07.371
- How are you gonna draw Katie out?

1563
01:28:07.371 --> 01:28:09.853
- Her mom lives in the same place.

1564
01:28:12.430 --> 01:28:13.880
- What if Katie doesn't show?

1565
01:28:14.827 --> 01:28:16.493
- Why wouldn't she?

1566
01:28:20.224 --> 01:28:22.307
- There's plenty options.

1567
01:28:24.630 --> 01:28:28.120
- You think Gwen loved
Katie more than anyone else?

1568
01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:30.190
- I don't think it matters anymore.

1569
01:28:32.523 --> 01:28:33.821
- Pull over.

1570
01:28:33.821 --> 01:28:36.987
(soft dramatic music)

1571
01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:41.993
- Wait.

1572
01:28:43.389 --> 01:28:44.933
What are you really asking me?

1573
01:28:46.050 --> 01:28:49.823
- Do you really think love
survives the object of affection?

1574
01:28:50.790 --> 01:28:52.190
- It depends.

1575
01:28:52.190 --> 01:28:56.141
Are you talking obsession
based love or deep caring love?

1576
01:28:56.141 --> 01:28:57.891
- Is the answer different for each?

1577
01:28:59.389 --> 01:29:00.223
- Yes.

1578
01:29:01.126 --> 01:29:04.610
Obsession based love
may become more intense.

1579
01:29:04.610 --> 01:29:08.830
Like any obsession intensifies
by the absence of the object

1580
01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:12.090
because it'll be fueled
by fantasies and what ifs.

1581
01:29:12.090 --> 01:29:14.950
On the other hand. deep caring
love may become more subdued

1582
01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:18.013
because of the acceptance
of loss as facts.

1583
01:29:19.487 --> 01:29:22.739
- You have a beautiful mind. Rianne.

1584
01:29:22.739 --> 01:29:25.906
(soft dramatic music)

1585
01:29:29.326 --> 01:29:31.076
- What just happened?

1586
01:30:15.527 --> 01:30:18.193
(phone ringing)

1587
01:30:22.096 --> 01:30:23.430
Hey. babe.

1588
01:30:23.430 --> 01:30:24.900
- I love you tons. boo.

1589
01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:28.093
- Babe. where are you?

1590
01:30:28.093 --> 01:30:31.280
- Did you really think I
didn't know it was you?

1591
01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:33.947
(ominous music)

1592
01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:37.493
- What are you talking about?

1593
01:30:37.493 --> 01:30:40.982
- You knew Katie wasn't coming
back because you killed her.

1594
01:30:40.982 --> 01:30:43.333
That's all I wasn't sure about.

1595
01:30:46.290 --> 01:30:48.083
- If this is your idea of a joke.

1596
01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:51.490
- [Cameron] I'm a hopeless
romantic actually.

1597
01:30:52.624 --> 01:30:54.593
Look on the table.

1598
01:30:54.593 --> 01:30:57.260
(ominous music)

1599
01:31:21.752 --> 01:31:23.469
- What do you want?

1600
01:31:23.469 --> 01:31:26.736
- I want to know why you killed Gwen.

1601
01:31:26.736 --> 01:31:29.403
(ominous music)

1602
01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:35.226
Did you really love her?

1603
01:31:35.226 --> 01:31:37.893
(ominous music)

1604
01:31:43.416 --> 01:31:46.050
- I thought I was special to her.

1605
01:31:46.050 --> 01:31:48.933
- Yet you replaced her so easily.

1606
01:31:50.460 --> 01:31:52.193
- She has nothing to do with this.

1607
01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:55.200
- [Cameron] Of course she does.

1608
01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:57.683
I'm gonna show you what
love is really about.

1609
01:31:59.325 --> 01:32:01.403
- I don't love that bitch.

1610
01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:03.073
Let her go.

1611
01:32:03.073 --> 01:32:04.860
- [Cameron] You know the thing about love

1612
01:32:04.860 --> 01:32:09.090
is once it's in your
bones. it never goes away.

1613
01:32:09.090 --> 01:32:10.580
- No. that's just a fixation.

1614
01:32:10.580 --> 01:32:14.020
Love nurtures. heals. protects.

1615
01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:15.297
- I did all that.

1616
01:32:16.141 --> 01:32:17.910
I healed her wounds.

1617
01:32:17.910 --> 01:32:19.550
Nurtured her passions.

1618
01:32:19.550 --> 01:32:22.184
I protected her from her own insecurities.

1619
01:32:22.184 --> 01:32:24.219
- That was a long time ago.

1620
01:32:24.219 --> 01:32:26.430
- [Cameron] Maybe you can
follow your own advice

1621
01:32:26.430 --> 01:32:31.059
and just move on. but if not.

1622
01:32:31.059 --> 01:32:33.913
how can you escape the
prison of her absence?

1623
01:32:34.850 --> 01:32:37.183
- Just let her go please.

1624
01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:41.317
- [Cameron] How long do you
think you can go without her?

1625
01:32:43.295 --> 01:32:45.712
- Look. I'll do anything you want.

1626
01:32:45.712 --> 01:32:47.190
- Anything.

1627
01:32:47.190 --> 01:32:49.090
- Just let her go.

1628
01:32:49.090 --> 01:32:50.639
- I always liked you. Rianne.

1629
01:32:50.639 --> 01:32:52.719
but not even you can imagine the pain

1630
01:32:52.719 --> 01:32:54.053
of going on without her.

1631
01:32:56.059 --> 01:32:57.032
- What do you want?

1632
01:32:57.032 --> 01:32:58.132
Would you just say it?

1633
01:33:00.250 --> 01:33:01.773
- [Cameron] I want you to be free.

1634
01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.150
- Don't do this.

1635
01:33:05.150 --> 01:33:08.358
- Go to the balcony and climb out.

1636
01:33:08.358 --> 01:33:11.025
(ominous music)

1637
01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:32.219
- Just put her on the phone please.

1638
01:33:32.219 --> 01:33:33.202
- I'm sorry. boo.

1639
01:33:33.202 --> 01:33:34.618
I don't know what happened.

1640
01:33:34.618 --> 01:33:35.752
- It's okay.

1641
01:33:35.752 --> 01:33:37.133
It's okay. babe.

1642
01:33:37.133 --> 01:33:39.800
(ominous music)

1643
01:33:41.223 --> 01:33:42.123
I love you tons.

1644
01:33:44.690 --> 01:33:45.573
- [Cameron] I'm waiting.

1645
01:33:47.323 --> 01:33:48.156
Now fly.

1646
01:33:52.014 --> 01:33:54.764
(dramatic music)
