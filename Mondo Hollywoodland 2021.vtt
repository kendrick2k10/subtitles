3
00:00:16.344 --> 00:00:19.620
We have a
liftoff. liftoff on Apollo 11.

4
00:01:11.551 --> 00:01:14.411
The sun
scorches through the day.

5
00:01:14.413 --> 00:01:18.204
but at night this place
will be terribly cold

6
00:01:18.206 --> 00:01:22.206
and dark. with only
the hint of starlight.

7
00:01:23.068 --> 00:01:27.241
A shining system of lights
will soon follow though.

8
00:01:27.862 --> 00:01:33.342
as we cross. cross over
from death to paradise.

9
00:01:33.344 --> 00:01:35.896
a paradise of mankind.

10
00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:39.758
The seat of kings.

11
00:01:39.931 --> 00:01:43.172
and the very Earth
their paupers will till.

12
00:01:45.413 --> 00:01:47.896
This is Hollywood.

13
00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.378
Hollywood is where movies
come from. my dears.

14
00:01:54.413 --> 00:01:56.689
That is its reason for being.

15
00:01:57.172 --> 00:02:00.241
That's what gave it
life. breathed into it.

16
00:02:00.551 --> 00:02:02.756
And like God with Adam.

17
00:02:02.758 --> 00:02:07.448
something was created from
only dirt. dust. and water.

18
00:02:12.448 --> 00:02:15.413
But what is today's
Hollywood really like?

19
00:02:17.931 --> 00:02:20.241
Indeed. we shall
seek the answer.

20
00:02:33.137 --> 00:02:34.241
Hollywood.

21
00:02:34.724 --> 00:02:35.965
What is it now?

22
00:02:38.103 --> 00:02:39.653
What about those
with their finger.

23
00:02:39.655 --> 00:02:43.239
no. not their finger.
but their entire bodies

24
00:02:43.241 --> 00:02:46.103
moving to the funk of
the real Hollywood?

25
00:02:59.655 --> 00:03:02.310
Do you know what Hollywood is?

26
00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:04.793
Hello. I'm speaking to you.

27
00:03:05.034 --> 00:03:06.377
What the hell
are you doing here?

28
00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:07.342
Do you know what-

29
00:03:07.344 --> 00:03:08.618
- Hollywood?

30
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.620
Yes.

31
00:03:10.965 --> 00:03:11.896
You want to see Hollywood?

32
00:03:11.965 --> 00:03:13.793
Yes. we'd really like to know.

33
00:03:24.965 --> 00:03:25.827
Hollywood's Mondo.

34
00:03:25.965 --> 00:03:26.965
Mondo?

35
00:03:27.482 --> 00:03:29.000
What's Mondo?

36
00:03:35.482 --> 00:03:37.342
Sir. excuse me.

37
00:03:37.344 --> 00:03:38.860
What's Mondo?

38
00:03:38.862 --> 00:03:40.653
You gotta go see
the man who knows.

39
00:03:40.655 --> 00:03:42.032
Pardon. who?

40
00:03:48.034 --> 00:03:49.448
The man who knows.

41
00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:51.135
We must find him now.

42
00:03:51.137 --> 00:03:55.000
This strange. inebriated
fellow must tell us how.

43
00:03:59.655 --> 00:04:02.551
Sir. where do we find
the man who knows?

44
00:04:02.586 --> 00:04:03.929
What is the address?

45
00:04:03.931 --> 00:04:06.724
3125 Birkdale Court.

46
00:04:14.931 --> 00:04:16.894
What is this Mondo?

47
00:04:16.896 --> 00:04:18.272
Can we make sense of it.

48
00:04:18.274 --> 00:04:21.962
or does it in fact defy
such banalities as sense?

49
00:04:21.964 --> 00:04:27.758
And just who is this man who
knows. this Norman Boyle?

50
00:04:52.724 --> 00:04:55.413
And yes hello. excuse me.

51
00:04:58.448 --> 00:05:00.137
What's the meaning of this?

52
00:05:14.931 --> 00:05:16.929
We're here to see Norman Boyle.

53
00:05:16.931 --> 00:05:18.000
I like you man.

54
00:05:21.344 --> 00:05:23.758
No one calls him
Norman. all right.

55
00:05:23.827 --> 00:05:25.310
His name's Boyle.

56
00:05:26.275 --> 00:05:27.586
Oh. I'm sorry.

57
00:05:28.344 --> 00:05:29.482
- Boyle?
- Yeah.

58
00:05:30.275 --> 00:05:31.931
It would be rude
to call him Norman.

59
00:05:36.344 --> 00:05:37.515
Are you groovy. man?

60
00:05:37.517 --> 00:05:38.687
I think so.

61
00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:41.068
Come on you guys.
let's help him out.

62
00:05:41.931 --> 00:05:44.137
He's cool man. he's fine.

63
00:05:44.172 --> 00:05:45.172
All right.

64
00:05:46.103 --> 00:05:47.103
Buzz man?

65
00:06:13.068 --> 00:06:14.894
I must speak to this man.

66
00:06:14.896 --> 00:06:17.342
I seek valuable
information he possesses.

67
00:06:17.344 --> 00:06:20.241
Guys. I'm gonna show
him where Norman is.

68
00:06:20.344 --> 00:06:21.344
All right.

69
00:06:26.862 --> 00:06:31.862
Get some cake. Get
some cake. Get some cake.

70
00:06:45.517 --> 00:06:47.827
Excuse me sir. may I?

71
00:06:47.896 --> 00:06:49.034
Boyle's in there man.

72
00:06:52.551 --> 00:06:53.862
Oh my word.

73
00:06:55.206 --> 00:06:57.482
Always pay your bills man.

74
00:07:03.103 --> 00:07:06.413
Hello. I come
here from the fifth dimension.

75
00:07:07.137 --> 00:07:09.068
Can you help me in my quest?

76
00:07:10.482 --> 00:07:13.135
Yeah. I don't know.

77
00:07:13.137 --> 00:07:15.413
It depends on what it is.

78
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.793
I was told Hollywood is Mondo.

79
00:07:17.965 --> 00:07:20.241
but what is Mondo?

80
00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.413
They say. you know
what it means.

81
00:07:23.137 --> 00:07:26.068
Mondo. yeah yeah.

82
00:07:26.241 --> 00:07:27.241
Huh?

83
00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:30.620
That's heavy. man.

84
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.101
Have you ever lost someone?

85
00:07:35.103 --> 00:07:38.931
Losing a loved
one is. well. so not groovy.

86
00:07:40.413 --> 00:07:41.551
You get it. then.

87
00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:45.275
I lost my cat. Zappo.

88
00:07:50.137 --> 00:07:51.653
I was devastated.

89
00:07:51.655 --> 00:07:54.653
And then through my readings
and other things. you know.

90
00:07:54.655 --> 00:07:56.101
you realize that
the bedrock nature

91
00:07:56.103 --> 00:07:57.275
of the universe is horror.

92
00:07:58.241 --> 00:08:02.032
However. there are forces
that guide us. you know

93
00:08:02.034 --> 00:08:04.204
like some grand puppeteer
and we're marionettes

94
00:08:04.206 --> 00:08:05.998
and our fingers
are puppet strings.

95
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
They. I don't know. man.

96
00:08:09.862 --> 00:08:11.448
Mondo is hard to explain.

97
00:08:12.482 --> 00:08:13.689
I built this chair.

98
00:08:14.827 --> 00:08:16.000
I had this vision.

99
00:08:50.034 --> 00:08:52.825
I don't know man. ever
since I lost Zappo

100
00:08:52.827 --> 00:08:54.965
I started dedicating
myself to my work.

101
00:08:56.137 --> 00:08:57.337
Let me take you to the mirror.

102
00:08:57.965 --> 00:08:58.998
It'll make more sense.

103
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.551
In my vision. I saw the Titans.

104
00:09:06.931 --> 00:09:08.172
the Weirdos.

105
00:09:10.103 --> 00:09:12.206
and the Dreamers.

106
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.687
And I started growing magic
mushrooms for all three.

107
00:09:15.689 --> 00:09:17.931
Grow 'em. process 'em.

108
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.549
I add a secret step. which
I can't tell you about.

109
00:09:21.551 --> 00:09:25.758
and then I turn the
horror into beauty.

110
00:09:26.551 --> 00:09:30.206
See? Titans. Weirdos. Dreamers.

111
00:09:31.379 --> 00:09:34.239
I can't explain
exactly what Mondo is.

112
00:09:34.241 --> 00:09:40.517
but I bet if you went and saw
Titans. Weirdos. the Dreamers.

113
00:09:40.758 --> 00:09:42.241
you'd find Mondo.

114
00:09:47.275 --> 00:09:49.068
I'm sorry about your cat.

115
00:11:35.275 --> 00:11:38.758
Boyle. we got an
agreement. okay?

116
00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.170
I give you low rent.

117
00:11:41.172 --> 00:11:43.756
and you're supposed to
take care of my property.

118
00:11:43.758 --> 00:11:45.618
But ever since
Zappo's been gone.

119
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.101
You've got a major rat problem.

120
00:11:48.103 --> 00:11:51.310
I can replace you. easy.

121
00:11:52.137 --> 00:11:54.448
One craigslist. just like that.

122
00:11:58.344 --> 00:12:00.172
Sorry about your Zappo.

123
00:12:03.862 --> 00:12:07.551
Call the exterminator right now.

124
00:12:12.724 --> 00:12:13.724
Rat trap.

125
00:12:14.241 --> 00:12:15.241
Tape.

126
00:12:18.862 --> 00:12:21.551
I'm gonna gas these rats.

127
00:12:30.689 --> 00:12:33.655
The Titans.
the first on our list.

128
00:12:33.862 --> 00:12:35.894
Like the proto-gods of yore.

129
00:12:35.896 --> 00:12:39.689
the Titans are imposing.
if not everlasting.

130
00:12:48.344 --> 00:12:50.551
No fuck ups. and
things delivered.

131
00:12:51.068 --> 00:12:53.342
That's my job as Chief
Operating Officer

132
00:12:53.344 --> 00:12:54.482
of Paveway Pictures.

133
00:12:56.482 --> 00:12:57.411
We've got it.

134
00:12:57.413 --> 00:12:59.862
We did Academy
Award-nominated films.

135
00:13:02.793 --> 00:13:05.275
tasteful arts.
selected at Cannes.

136
00:13:08.586 --> 00:13:09.793
You name it. we've got it.

137
00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.448
Right now. I've got this sci-fi
picture. "Speed of Light.".

138
00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.275
"Twilight" in space.

139
00:13:20.655 --> 00:13:23.103
But the Disney star's
got in some problems.

140
00:13:24.965 --> 00:13:26.379
It's my job to fix it.

141
00:13:31.965 --> 00:13:33.275
Hi Tom.

142
00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.448
Let's get this over with.

143
00:13:56.551 --> 00:13:58.308
Cavity resonance.

144
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:59.310
Wait wait.

145
00:13:59.482 --> 00:14:00.653
I'm supposed to be an alien.

146
00:14:00.655 --> 00:14:01.862
Should I do a voice?

147
00:14:01.965 --> 00:14:03.034
No.

148
00:14:03.344 --> 00:14:04.655
Focus okay?

149
00:14:06.206 --> 00:14:07.655
Cavity resonance.

150
00:14:08.344 --> 00:14:09.034
What?

151
00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:11.204
Another way to measure
the speed of light

152
00:14:11.206 --> 00:14:12.791
is to independently measure

153
00:14:12.793 --> 00:14:14.860
the frequency and the wavelength

154
00:14:14.862 --> 00:14:16.549
of the electromagnetic field.

155
00:14:16.551 --> 00:14:18.689
Wow. you know your stuff.

156
00:14:19.344 --> 00:14:21.482
I'm so happy to have met you.

157
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.172
You're the most important
thing in my life.

158
00:14:27.034 --> 00:14:28.206
What the fuck was that?

159
00:14:28.379 --> 00:14:30.549
Science and feelings
don't go together.

160
00:14:30.551 --> 00:14:32.653
I mean. I want to do
stuff with meaning.

161
00:14:32.655 --> 00:14:35.032
I want to do like plays.

162
00:14:35.034 --> 00:14:37.135
Oh my God. you'd
be great in a play.

163
00:14:37.137 --> 00:14:38.170
I'd be good in a play.

164
00:14:38.172 --> 00:14:39.377
You'd be so good in a play.

165
00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:42.135
I saw a play on the West
End when I was in the UK.

166
00:14:42.137 --> 00:14:43.000
So much ketamine.

167
00:14:43.137 --> 00:14:43.860
So much.

168
00:14:43.862 --> 00:14:45.515
I wish I had some.

169
00:14:45.517 --> 00:14:46.860
Yeah. I was like
seven years old.

170
00:14:46.862 --> 00:14:49.032
and I was like. woah.
this is intense.

171
00:14:49.034 --> 00:14:50.034
Seven?

172
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:52.470
Can you just do me a biggie
and cut up that watermelon?

173
00:14:53.689 --> 00:14:55.862
But we just got here.
there aren't any knives.

174
00:15:00.517 --> 00:15:01.929
Illegal
aliens are the hot topic.

175
00:15:01.931 --> 00:15:05.101
No. not illegal aliens. Dick.

176
00:15:05.103 --> 00:15:07.273
I know what a fucking
illegal alien is.

177
00:15:07.275 --> 00:15:08.411
Gaga. Trump.

178
00:15:08.413 --> 00:15:11.377
Yeah. I'd rather be doing
an illegal alien movie.

179
00:15:11.379 --> 00:15:12.896
Fucking put me in a truck.

180
00:15:13.034 --> 00:15:14.101
I believe in you.

181
00:15:14.103 --> 00:15:15.860
That's why I represent you.

182
00:15:15.862 --> 00:15:17.344
You're a loser.

183
00:15:59.551 --> 00:16:00.551
Did Dick call?

184
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
No.

185
00:16:04.655 --> 00:16:06.827
Oh wait. Yeah yeah.

186
00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:09.655
Can you set up a meeting?

187
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:14.103
Hey man.

188
00:16:14.172 --> 00:16:15.172
What up?

189
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.137
I tried that. she won't budge.

190
00:16:24.206 --> 00:16:26.620
She insists her character
wouldn't say those kind of things.

191
00:16:26.689 --> 00:16:29.344
Listen. this director
is not gonna take notes

192
00:16:29.517 --> 00:16:32.172
from a fucking
17-year-old Disney actor.

193
00:16:32.344 --> 00:16:33.791
Look. you can talk
to her. all right?

194
00:16:33.793 --> 00:16:35.101
I'll have Sam coordinate
a time to meet.

195
00:16:35.103 --> 00:16:35.793
Fine.

196
00:16:35.862 --> 00:16:37.618
Just email Grace
with some dates.

197
00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:39.653
Look. you know.
you guys are Latinx.

198
00:16:40.482 --> 00:16:41.273
Yeah. sure.

199
00:16:41.275 --> 00:16:42.275
All right. you got this.

200
00:16:44.965 --> 00:16:45.965
Oh fuck.

201
00:16:46.137 --> 00:16:47.137
Just a question.

202
00:16:47.206 --> 00:16:48.860
what are the chances that
we can recast Poloma?

203
00:16:48.862 --> 00:16:50.825
I don't need an explanation.
just a yes or no.

204
00:16:50.827 --> 00:16:51.655
No.

205
00:16:51.827 --> 00:16:52.963
Why. what happened?

206
00:16:52.965 --> 00:16:54.929
Am I gonna see her tomorrow
on TMZ with white powder

207
00:16:54.931 --> 00:16:55.931
all over her nose.

208
00:16:56.068 --> 00:16:57.480
crawling out of a club
with a broken heel or what?

209
00:16:57.482 --> 00:16:58.842
No. no. no. no.
There's no problem.

210
00:16:59.758 --> 00:17:02.482
What if I were your manager?

211
00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:10.515
Shut your dirty
little gay mouth.

212
00:17:10.517 --> 00:17:12.378
You shut your
little Latina face.

213
00:17:14.241 --> 00:17:15.896
Let's do coconut
and talk about it.

214
00:17:18.655 --> 00:17:19.584
You know. I need to be doing

215
00:17:19.586 --> 00:17:21.721
what Natalie Portman does. okay?

216
00:17:21.723 --> 00:17:23.342
Not like Peyton List does.

217
00:17:23.344 --> 00:17:24.550
I want perfume ads.

218
00:17:24.758 --> 00:17:26.032
I feel like someone
was after me.

219
00:17:26.034 --> 00:17:28.342
like if TMZ was like after me.

220
00:17:28.344 --> 00:17:30.204
like you would be
there to cover my ass.

221
00:17:30.206 --> 00:17:31.998
I wouldn't be like Britney
with the shaved head.

222
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
you'd get me away.

223
00:17:34.034 --> 00:17:35.413
How do I get on SNL?

224
00:17:36.034 --> 00:17:38.549
Well. that's the question
that I'm here to answer.

225
00:17:38.551 --> 00:17:39.896
if I were your manager.

226
00:17:40.034 --> 00:17:42.929
I'll do to the Disneyland castle

227
00:17:42.931 --> 00:17:45.896
what Mohamed Atta did
tower number one and two.

228
00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:49.204
Oh my God. you wanna go outside?

229
00:17:49.206 --> 00:17:50.206
Yeah.

230
00:17:50.344 --> 00:17:51.515
Terrible idea.

231
00:17:51.517 --> 00:17:52.549
Let's go in.

232
00:17:54.068 --> 00:17:55.549
I mean Tupac just left LA.

233
00:17:55.551 --> 00:17:56.998
He's alive. he's alive.

234
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.170
Tupac is still alive.

235
00:17:59.172 --> 00:18:01.965
and he's like sad when
people pretend he's dead.

236
00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:13.620
Gross.

237
00:18:18.482 --> 00:18:19.584
We got to go get blow. man.

238
00:18:19.586 --> 00:18:20.931
This is ridiculous.

239
00:18:21.724 --> 00:18:22.549
Come on man.

240
00:18:22.551 --> 00:18:23.551
Whoa man.

241
00:18:24.137 --> 00:18:25.446
You got to get
another hand soap. man.

242
00:18:25.448 --> 00:18:27.653
You can't use fucking
bar soap for hand soap.

243
00:18:27.655 --> 00:18:29.375
You know how much
bacteria is on that stuff?

244
00:18:29.413 --> 00:18:30.411
What's wrong with my hand soap?

245
00:18:30.413 --> 00:18:31.101
It's shitty.

246
00:18:31.103 --> 00:18:32.965
You use your hands.

247
00:18:33.241 --> 00:18:34.355
You wash your hands all day.

248
00:18:34.379 --> 00:18:35.653
and then you know.
you get shitty soap. It's just-

249
00:18:35.655 --> 00:18:37.255
- Smells like an Irish
spring. I like it.

250
00:18:37.724 --> 00:18:38.724
Get your beer.

251
00:18:38.827 --> 00:18:40.791
Hey. so what's going
on with this blow?

252
00:18:40.793 --> 00:18:42.482
We going soon. or
what's the deal?

253
00:18:42.931 --> 00:18:44.971
I can't go tonight. man.
I've got to deal with this.

254
00:18:45.241 --> 00:18:46.241
What?

255
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:47.239
I can't go tonight.

256
00:18:47.241 --> 00:18:48.308
What do you mean you can't
go tonight?

257
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:49.310
We are going tonight.

258
00:18:49.448 --> 00:18:51.549
That's what we decided on.
we're gonna go tonight.

259
00:18:51.551 --> 00:18:52.894
I can't go anymore.

260
00:18:52.896 --> 00:18:54.241
I gotta deal with this.

261
00:18:55.448 --> 00:18:56.793
You gotta. this was our plan.

262
00:18:57.068 --> 00:18:59.066
You know. you understand
my time is valuable.

263
00:18:59.068 --> 00:19:00.446
You think it was
my plan for a bunch

264
00:19:00.448 --> 00:19:02.172
of rats to show up
in my goddamn attic?

265
00:19:04.655 --> 00:19:05.825
Dude. we'll go on Friday.

266
00:19:05.827 --> 00:19:06.377
Friday?

267
00:19:06.379 --> 00:19:07.379
Let's remember that.

268
00:19:09.034 --> 00:19:10.034
Friday.

269
00:19:11.206 --> 00:19:12.246
- Put in my...
- want some?

270
00:19:12.896 --> 00:19:15.034
No. I'm coming down
now. hold the ladder.

271
00:19:15.172 --> 00:19:16.527
Ain't nothing wrong
with a little jake.

272
00:19:16.551 --> 00:19:18.965
Tell me more about this
soap you use for bumps?

273
00:19:20.862 --> 00:19:23.000
For the hand soap. I use.

274
00:19:23.344 --> 00:19:24.825
which is. it's very
good French soap.

275
00:19:24.827 --> 00:19:26.515
It smells nice. great
packaging. it's all that.

276
00:19:26.517 --> 00:19:27.549
And it's something
that's always there.

277
00:19:27.551 --> 00:19:28.838
You don't have to
use it all the time.

278
00:19:28.862 --> 00:19:31.308
But for the body you can
actually use a good bar of soap.

279
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:32.034
And I have this one.

280
00:19:32.206 --> 00:19:34.135
It's got this
charcoal magnesium.

281
00:19:34.137 --> 00:19:36.172
which doesn't allow
it to get all...

282
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:38.000
- Hold the ladder.
- Slimy. you know.

283
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:39.963
You take all the batteries

284
00:19:39.965 --> 00:19:41.010
out of all the
alarms in the house.

285
00:19:41.034 --> 00:19:42.653
This is how human
beings kill themselves.

286
00:19:42.655 --> 00:19:44.687
You don't think I can
kill a few rodents?

287
00:19:44.689 --> 00:19:45.998
Precision. precision.

288
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.135
things get accomplished
with precision.

289
00:19:48.137 --> 00:19:49.172
Tug on that.

290
00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:52.135
Pretty good. right?

291
00:19:52.137 --> 00:19:53.206
Not bad.

292
00:19:53.482 --> 00:19:55.242
We still should get a
hose on the other side.

293
00:19:56.793 --> 00:19:57.793
You ready?

294
00:19:58.517 --> 00:19:59.517
What's going on here?

295
00:20:02.137 --> 00:20:03.310
What's going on here?

296
00:20:03.862 --> 00:20:05.687
Just some maintenance man.
just working on the house.

297
00:20:05.689 --> 00:20:07.009
No no no no.
what's going on here?

298
00:20:07.517 --> 00:20:08.515
Just some house
maintenance. man.

299
00:20:08.517 --> 00:20:09.515
Maintenance?

300
00:20:09.517 --> 00:20:12.032
A hose is coming
out of your car?

301
00:20:12.034 --> 00:20:13.182
Hey. we're just
having a beer. man.

302
00:20:13.206 --> 00:20:14.803
I don't know who you are.
Please don't speak to me.

303
00:20:14.827 --> 00:20:15.827
It's just a hoax.

304
00:20:15.896 --> 00:20:17.482
This is insanity.
I live right there.

305
00:20:17.551 --> 00:20:18.655
I feel very uncomfortable.

306
00:20:18.827 --> 00:20:20.549
It is this very nefarious.

307
00:20:20.551 --> 00:20:21.825
and definitely illegal.
definitely illegal.

308
00:20:21.827 --> 00:20:22.791
Definitely illegal?

309
00:20:22.793 --> 00:20:23.860
Dude. I'm a law abiding citizen.

310
00:20:23.862 --> 00:20:25.998
I've never done anything
illegal in my entire life.

311
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.308
I know what goes
on in here. okay?

312
00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:28.894
I know all those weird
little things you do.

313
00:20:28.896 --> 00:20:30.515
It's all very inappropriate.
and very strange strange.

314
00:20:30.517 --> 00:20:32.320
Things. what are you talking
about. things that go on?

315
00:20:32.344 --> 00:20:33.170
What laws of am I breaking?

316
00:20:33.172 --> 00:20:33.998
I got proof.

317
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.344
- Proof?
- Yeah.

318
00:20:37.172 --> 00:20:38.172
What are you doing?

319
00:20:45.034 --> 00:20:46.655
Just remember that.

320
00:20:47.689 --> 00:20:48.689
Friday.

321
00:20:49.689 --> 00:20:51.034
- Put it in my...
- want some?

322
00:20:51.517 --> 00:20:53.860
No.
I'm coming down now. hold the ladder.

323
00:20:53.862 --> 00:20:54.963
Ain't nothing wrong
with a little Jake.

324
00:20:54.965 --> 00:20:56.000
That's illegal. man.

325
00:20:57.379 --> 00:20:57.860
That's illegal.

326
00:20:57.862 --> 00:20:58.618
You can't tape.

327
00:20:58.620 --> 00:20:59.620
It's not illegal.

328
00:20:59.655 --> 00:21:00.929
It's not cocaine. I
was smelling my hands.

329
00:21:00.931 --> 00:21:02.034
That's ridiculous.

330
00:21:02.103 --> 00:21:03.377
What an insane excuse.

331
00:21:03.379 --> 00:21:04.894
He was smelling his
hands. I got bad soap.

332
00:21:04.896 --> 00:21:05.976
If I see any of this again.

333
00:21:06.137 --> 00:21:08.446
if I see any of this. this
car and this gas or this man.

334
00:21:08.448 --> 00:21:10.929
I will call the police and
that's final. that's it.

335
00:21:10.931 --> 00:21:11.931
Police?

336
00:21:12.103 --> 00:21:13.239
That's it. no. no. no.

337
00:21:13.241 --> 00:21:15.101
this is over. the
conversation's over. it's done.

338
00:21:15.103 --> 00:21:16.103
It's done.

339
00:21:17.241 --> 00:21:18.586
Okay. thank you. bye.

340
00:21:20.586 --> 00:21:21.586
Jesus.

341
00:21:22.379 --> 00:21:23.517
Fuck man. what do I do?

342
00:21:24.241 --> 00:21:25.241
Just don't do it now.

343
00:21:25.379 --> 00:21:28.413
Wait. you think he'll do
something with that video?

344
00:21:29.103 --> 00:21:30.103
I don't know. man.

345
00:21:30.689 --> 00:21:31.448
I don't trust him.

346
00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:33.241
I think he's a
fascist and a pervert.

347
00:21:57.862 --> 00:21:58.862
Dres?

348
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.620
You need to tell me that
this is all worth it.

349
00:22:09.931 --> 00:22:10.931
It is.

350
00:22:27.275 --> 00:22:29.655
We oppose as
a continual threat to peace.

351
00:22:32.482 --> 00:22:34.515
These are the contrasting
points of view

352
00:22:34.517 --> 00:22:35.998
between the major antagonist.

353
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.273
As a creature. not a God.

354
00:22:38.275 --> 00:22:39.586
but of the state.

355
00:22:40.172 --> 00:22:42.241
The state will run
his life for him.

356
00:22:42.586 --> 00:22:43.931
His political life.

357
00:22:44.172 --> 00:22:45.655
his business life.

358
00:22:47.103 --> 00:22:48.275
his social life.

359
00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:51.342
I don't know man. this
pervert across the street's

360
00:22:51.344 --> 00:22:52.687
got me all fucking paranoid.

361
00:22:52.689 --> 00:22:54.515
I'm not feeling good. I
don't like any of this.

362
00:22:54.517 --> 00:22:55.687
I feel like the
cops are after me.

363
00:22:55.689 --> 00:22:56.791
I feel like the
government's after me.

364
00:22:56.793 --> 00:22:57.963
I feel like everyone's after me.

365
00:22:57.965 --> 00:22:58.998
I feel like people watch me.

366
00:22:59.000 --> 00:22:59.998
I feel like Derek's after me.

367
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.066
I feel like everything
is not going my way.

368
00:23:02.068 --> 00:23:03.344
it's not very Mondo.

369
00:23:03.551 --> 00:23:05.068
I do not like it.
It's not groovy.

370
00:23:05.379 --> 00:23:08.172
This whole situation
is making me feel like

371
00:23:09.172 --> 00:23:10.653
the rats are not
only in the attic.

372
00:23:10.655 --> 00:23:11.998
they're in my head. you know.

373
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.687
They're in my brain.
they're in my eyes.

374
00:23:13.689 --> 00:23:14.860
they're in my fingertips.

375
00:23:14.862 --> 00:23:17.241
and I feel like I'm gonna
lose my fucking mind.

376
00:23:17.586 --> 00:23:18.549
From this belief

377
00:23:18.551 --> 00:23:21.586
in man as a responsible being.

378
00:23:21.758 --> 00:23:24.066
all the beliefs and his
other qualifications

379
00:23:24.068 --> 00:23:25.379
which we accept.

380
00:23:25.413 --> 00:23:28.344
usually even without
bothering to think about them.

381
00:23:28.413 --> 00:23:30.584
as parts of that
vague condition.

382
00:23:30.586 --> 00:23:33.379
which we call the American way.

383
00:23:34.413 --> 00:23:36.860
His ability. indeed his right

384
00:23:36.862 --> 00:23:39.137
to explore the
truth in all things.

385
00:23:40.206 --> 00:23:42.000
His ability to govern himself.

386
00:23:57.724 --> 00:23:59.137
I am for peace.

387
00:24:00.172 --> 00:24:01.206
When I speak.

388
00:24:01.551 --> 00:24:02.931
they are for war.

389
00:24:06.068 --> 00:24:07.206
Lock 'em and load 'em.

390
00:24:18.448 --> 00:24:21.275
Ever since you told
me you got a facial.

391
00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:24.135
all I can see in my
nose are these pores.

392
00:24:24.137 --> 00:24:25.446
Yeah. you can see 'em. right?

393
00:24:25.448 --> 00:24:26.239
You gotta get rid of that shit.

394
00:24:26.241 --> 00:24:27.066
It's under here.

395
00:24:27.068 --> 00:24:28.273
Yeah.

396
00:24:28.275 --> 00:24:29.101
Think about it.

397
00:24:29.103 --> 00:24:30.135
That's the only thing I see.

398
00:24:30.137 --> 00:24:31.257
You gotta have that cleaned.

399
00:24:32.793 --> 00:24:34.137
This blow better be good. man.

400
00:24:34.275 --> 00:24:37.413
Your fate. destination.
is on your right.

401
00:24:39.758 --> 00:24:40.758
Man.

402
00:24:42.413 --> 00:24:43.448
The man from heaven.

403
00:24:44.965 --> 00:24:46.758
I would recommend something on.

404
00:24:48.137 --> 00:24:49.965
30 rounds. full automatic.

405
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:53.308
M-16 style. for a little
bit more distance.

406
00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:54.310
a little more accurate.

407
00:24:55.413 --> 00:24:58.722
I would definitely highly
recommend a Mossberg shotgun.

408
00:24:58.724 --> 00:25:00.860
Maybe something small like this.

409
00:25:00.862 --> 00:25:02.310
you put it in the back pocket.

410
00:25:02.655 --> 00:25:04.687
What do we
got going on over here?

411
00:25:04.689 --> 00:25:06.275
These are special.

412
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.448
The best defense against tyranny
is a well-armed populace.

413
00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:16.377
See where this guy is looking

414
00:25:16.379 --> 00:25:17.342
at the business end of the gun.

415
00:25:17.344 --> 00:25:18.624
that's the wrong end of the gun.

416
00:25:19.034 --> 00:25:20.424
You don't want to put
that next to your face.

417
00:25:20.448 --> 00:25:21.448
Isn't that right?

418
00:25:21.689 --> 00:25:22.862
That's right.

419
00:25:37.827 --> 00:25:39.172
Beautiful day.

420
00:25:40.172 --> 00:25:41.620
Beautiful day.

421
00:25:42.137 --> 00:25:43.310
About time. sunshine.

422
00:25:49.965 --> 00:25:50.998
Whoa whoa whoa.

423
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Shh.

424
00:26:03.689 --> 00:26:04.689
Beef stick?

425
00:26:18.068 --> 00:26:19.068
Hey wait.

426
00:26:21.586 --> 00:26:23.000
Take this instead.

427
00:26:23.586 --> 00:26:24.413
What the fuck is this?

428
00:26:24.551 --> 00:26:25.586
Just try it out.

429
00:26:25.724 --> 00:26:26.586
Do I snort this?

430
00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:30.172
No. put it in wine
or water or tea.

431
00:26:30.862 --> 00:26:31.862
I can snort this.

432
00:26:33.034 --> 00:26:34.377
Yeah. snort it.

433
00:26:34.379 --> 00:26:35.584
Actually yeah. snort it.

434
00:26:35.586 --> 00:26:36.689
I can snort this.

435
00:26:38.689 --> 00:26:39.862
It's just one line.

436
00:26:40.275 --> 00:26:42.517
One line.

437
00:26:44.275 --> 00:26:46.068
I-I-I-don't-

438
00:26:48.103 --> 00:26:49.383
I don't know what you're saying.

439
00:26:49.448 --> 00:26:52.000
I don't speak Polish.

440
00:26:55.275 --> 00:26:56.275
Hey Ted.

441
00:26:57.931 --> 00:27:02.586
Yesterday. you left
your bag of coke here.

442
00:27:03.275 --> 00:27:05.068
It's not coke. it's sugar.

443
00:27:05.482 --> 00:27:06.655
I'm hypoglycemic.

444
00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:08.620
Where is it?

445
00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:15.101
I don't care where it is.

446
00:27:15.103 --> 00:27:16.135
Just pick a place.

447
00:27:16.137 --> 00:27:16.827
Of course. of course.

448
00:27:17.103 --> 00:27:18.515
Alright. look.
I'll pick a time and date.

449
00:27:18.517 --> 00:27:19.618
And when you get the table.

450
00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.137
just make sure it's for three.

451
00:27:21.655 --> 00:27:22.827
Dres is my new manager.

452
00:27:30.275 --> 00:27:31.275
Wednesday.

453
00:27:33.344 --> 00:27:34.758
You want me to paint?

454
00:27:37.172 --> 00:27:38.827
Well I can't paint.

455
00:27:38.931 --> 00:27:40.655
I can't paint any more.

456
00:27:40.965 --> 00:27:43.931
But you. you are.

457
00:27:44.793 --> 00:27:46.931
the blind painter.

458
00:28:11.896 --> 00:28:12.896
Hi.

459
00:28:14.724 --> 00:28:16.458
I thought you said your
manager was gonna be here?

460
00:28:16.482 --> 00:28:17.482
The new guy.

461
00:28:17.551 --> 00:28:20.172
It's just us. so did
you talk to the director?

462
00:28:24.689 --> 00:28:25.896
Don't do the Spanish thing.

463
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:26.655
Okay?

464
00:28:26.689 --> 00:28:27.722
Yeah. you're right.

465
00:28:27.724 --> 00:28:28.756
I don't know why did that shit.

466
00:28:28.758 --> 00:28:29.894
Listen. the
director's an asshole

467
00:28:29.896 --> 00:28:30.976
and won't budge. all right?

468
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.931
The more I push it. the
more she wants to recast.

469
00:28:33.103 --> 00:28:35.101
The more I defend you. the more
she thinks I'm against her.

470
00:28:35.103 --> 00:28:37.377
So I'm in a tight spot here.
I need you to help me out.

471
00:28:37.379 --> 00:28:39.068
Let's figure this
thing out. please.

472
00:28:39.241 --> 00:28:40.722
You're in a tight spot?

473
00:28:40.724 --> 00:28:42.241
It's me that's on screen.

474
00:28:42.379 --> 00:28:44.687
My likelihood. my face.

475
00:28:44.689 --> 00:28:46.862
Yeah. but we need you
in Atlanta in three days.

476
00:28:47.344 --> 00:28:50.342
I'm not gonna be in Atlanta
in three fucking days.

477
00:28:50.344 --> 00:28:52.170
You sign a contract.
you read the script.

478
00:28:52.172 --> 00:28:53.515
You say yes. you show up.

479
00:28:53.517 --> 00:28:54.687
you flash that
pretty smile yours.

480
00:28:54.689 --> 00:28:55.689
and we all move along.

481
00:28:55.827 --> 00:28:57.034
You make a paycheck and go.

482
00:28:58.172 --> 00:28:59.586
Flash that pretty smile?

483
00:28:59.689 --> 00:29:02.275
This is my fucking life. okay?

484
00:29:02.482 --> 00:29:04.929
I'm not just gonna
walk onto set and go.

485
00:29:04.931 --> 00:29:06.896
hey. let's make a
movie about aliens.

486
00:29:06.931 --> 00:29:09.310
I fucking hate aliens.

487
00:29:09.413 --> 00:29:11.791
So I need to. I need to regroup.

488
00:29:11.793 --> 00:29:13.618
I need you to change the lines.

489
00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:15.308
Okay. cause that's your job.

490
00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:16.825
And I don't see why
that's so fucking bad.

491
00:29:16.827 --> 00:29:18.347
I am doing my job.
that's why I'm here.

492
00:29:18.482 --> 00:29:22.034
I need you to do your job
and show up and deliver.

493
00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:23.482
Okay?

494
00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:24.653
You're making a lot
of money for this.

495
00:29:24.655 --> 00:29:27.310
I have one million
followers on Instagram.

496
00:29:27.586 --> 00:29:29.618
I get thousands of dollars

497
00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:33.135
for posting a picture of me
fucking brushing my teeth.

498
00:29:33.137 --> 00:29:34.655
What the fuck are
you talking about?

499
00:29:34.827 --> 00:29:36.239
Do you make money for literally

500
00:29:36.241 --> 00:29:38.551
just pretending to
drink a smart water?

501
00:29:39.137 --> 00:29:42.653
Do you make money for
walking a Yorkie named Paul.

502
00:29:42.655 --> 00:29:44.482
who has an Instagram following?

503
00:29:44.586 --> 00:29:46.584
Do you make money for
stepping outside your door

504
00:29:46.586 --> 00:29:48.411
and taking a photo in
front of a palm tree.

505
00:29:48.413 --> 00:29:49.756
wearing a shirt
that says Nevada?

506
00:29:49.758 --> 00:29:51.756
Do you make money for
sitting outside your pool.

507
00:29:51.758 --> 00:29:53.273
sleeping all day?

508
00:29:53.275 --> 00:29:56.101
I have a photographer come
to take pictures of me

509
00:29:56.103 --> 00:29:57.480
- sleeping.
- Okay. that's enough.

510
00:29:57.482 --> 00:29:59.308
I don't think you're
understanding this.

511
00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:01.965
It's like I shit money.

512
00:30:02.137 --> 00:30:04.549
I can just pay
off this contract.

513
00:30:04.551 --> 00:30:05.655
I don't have to do it.

514
00:30:05.758 --> 00:30:07.825
My manager and I read
the script more closely

515
00:30:07.827 --> 00:30:10.135
and we think the lines
are fucking shitty.

516
00:30:10.137 --> 00:30:11.618
A two-year-old
could've written them.

517
00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:14.103
So let's change them. I don't
see what the problem is.

518
00:30:18.275 --> 00:30:19.275
I think we're done here.

519
00:30:22.758 --> 00:30:25.549
One. a few days.
you can't just. no.

520
00:30:25.551 --> 00:30:26.551
- No.
- Okay.

521
00:30:26.724 --> 00:30:27.724
No.

522
00:30:28.413 --> 00:30:31.446
My manager will email you
the rest of my requests.

523
00:30:31.448 --> 00:30:33.448
'cause I might add some
fucking more. okay?

524
00:30:33.655 --> 00:30:36.275
Oh great. please.
just pile on your list.

525
00:30:36.413 --> 00:30:37.310
Yeah. all right.

526
00:30:37.413 --> 00:30:38.620
It was nice to see you. okay?

527
00:30:40.931 --> 00:30:41.965
Oh. and by the way?

528
00:30:43.103 --> 00:30:43.586
Yeah.

529
00:30:44.034 --> 00:30:45.448
You have some
cocaine on your nose.

530
00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:47.068
It's sunscreen.

531
00:31:10.793 --> 00:31:11.862
Baby rats from the attic.

532
00:31:22.655 --> 00:31:23.860
Bourne Idenity soundtrack.

533
00:31:23.862 --> 00:31:24.862
Great to drive to.

534
00:31:48.655 --> 00:31:50.618
You know what.
tell the director.

535
00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:51.793
and just fuck 'em.

536
00:31:53.172 --> 00:31:55.000
Paloma's the fuckin' money!

537
00:32:19.586 --> 00:32:20.586
It's Ted.

538
00:32:21.275 --> 00:32:23.758
Scene 42. the line's changing.

539
00:32:24.068 --> 00:32:25.068
Make it happen.

540
00:32:25.275 --> 00:32:27.172
No questions. Bye.

541
00:32:32.275 --> 00:32:33.929
Let's go get some
cocktails. baby.

542
00:32:33.931 --> 00:32:35.101
Yeah. let's cruise man.

543
00:32:35.103 --> 00:32:36.103
Yeah!

544
00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:41.584
What is there like
even in Arkansas anyway?

545
00:32:41.586 --> 00:32:43.620
I think it will be fun. Dres.

546
00:32:43.724 --> 00:32:46.241
I know a UPM there
who has a hookup.

547
00:32:46.724 --> 00:32:48.034
We'll survive.

548
00:32:48.275 --> 00:32:49.275
Hello?

549
00:32:49.931 --> 00:32:51.377
That's not gonna work for me.

550
00:32:51.379 --> 00:32:52.618
I actually noticed that Miles

551
00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:54.896
had three times the
per diem that I do.

552
00:32:55.551 --> 00:32:59.000
and I'm higher on the call
sheet. so do the math.

553
00:33:00.068 --> 00:33:01.172
All right.

554
00:33:01.275 --> 00:33:02.344
Mm-hmm.

555
00:33:02.517 --> 00:33:04.310
Have a wonderful day.

556
00:33:10.275 --> 00:33:11.791
People these days.

557
00:33:11.793 --> 00:33:13.103
They fucking suck.

558
00:33:26.275 --> 00:33:27.275
Fucking awesome.

559
00:34:57.896 --> 00:34:58.896
In the night.

560
00:34:59.344 --> 00:35:02.273
the playground of the
Titans crosses over

561
00:35:02.275 --> 00:35:05.275
into the dominion
of the Weirdos.

562
00:35:15.448 --> 00:35:16.482
It's a discussion.

563
00:35:16.758 --> 00:35:19.310
We're all talking ideologies
at this get together.

564
00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:22.275
libertarians.
communists. capitalists.

565
00:35:22.758 --> 00:35:24.448
democrats. and conservatives.

566
00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:30.101
And you have
to be in awe of the Weirdos.

567
00:35:30.103 --> 00:35:32.965
the heartbeat of
all things Mondo.

568
00:35:33.103 --> 00:35:36.793
means one must be prepared
for counter-perspectives.

569
00:35:47.655 --> 00:35:50.413
That is how the
counterculture exists.

570
00:35:50.655 --> 00:35:53.584
And if it is to
thrive in Hollywood.

571
00:35:53.586 --> 00:35:57.448
then it must take all
shapes. all sizes.

572
00:36:03.862 --> 00:36:05.862
Boogaloo gate opening.

573
00:36:14.137 --> 00:36:15.689
Welcome to my Boogaloo.

574
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000
I'm an astrological priestess.

575
00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:24.308
My goal is to
create environments

576
00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:28.310
that spark love. energy.
and healthy debate.

577
00:36:31.482 --> 00:36:32.482
Hey. I'm Caesar.

578
00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:34.689
I met Naya at Diamond 7.

579
00:36:35.034 --> 00:36:37.137
Her discussion's
gonna be amazing.

580
00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:39.689
And as for myself. I
make giant spheres.

581
00:36:41.551 --> 00:36:44.000
I like to find stuff
that speaks to me.

582
00:36:44.379 --> 00:36:46.480
and then speak back to it.

583
00:36:46.482 --> 00:36:47.653
This piece of wood last night

584
00:36:47.655 --> 00:36:48.998
was saying all kinds
of stuff about me

585
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.549
that I didn't super-appreciate.

586
00:36:50.551 --> 00:36:52.206
But then this branch
kind of stepped in.

587
00:36:52.379 --> 00:36:55.308
and that was really nice to
have that backup from this.

588
00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:56.068
And at the end of the day

589
00:36:56.172 --> 00:36:57.724
we started decided
we could all be

590
00:36:57.896 --> 00:37:00.066
in sort of a flowing
argument with each other.

591
00:37:00.068 --> 00:37:02.586
and that would actually
produce something beautiful.

592
00:37:30.896 --> 00:37:32.446
This is my sanctuary.

593
00:37:32.448 --> 00:37:34.241
and these are my
Venice Beach buds.

594
00:37:35.931 --> 00:37:37.446
I don't really hang
out with these people

595
00:37:37.448 --> 00:37:38.446
outside of rollerblading

596
00:37:38.448 --> 00:37:40.379
so I've never actually
seen their feet.

597
00:37:40.931 --> 00:37:42.517
Or I've never seen
them in shoes.

598
00:37:44.206 --> 00:37:45.758
So they might not
even have feet.

599
00:37:45.862 --> 00:37:46.896
You know what I mean?

600
00:37:52.103 --> 00:37:53.896
These are some of
my Antifa friends.

601
00:37:54.241 --> 00:37:55.756
We actually have been following

602
00:37:55.758 --> 00:37:57.549
a Neo-Nazi online.
through Anonymous.

603
00:37:57.551 --> 00:37:58.689
and we have his address.

604
00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:09.655
So today we're gonna vote
on what to do with him.

605
00:38:09.827 --> 00:38:11.103
Let's go check it out.

606
00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:12.034
Hey guys. what's going on?

607
00:38:12.241 --> 00:38:13.825
Eddie. where's the armband?

608
00:38:13.827 --> 00:38:15.137
This is very important.

609
00:38:15.172 --> 00:38:15.862
What's going on?

610
00:38:15.931 --> 00:38:16.825
What's going on?
What's going on?

611
00:38:16.827 --> 00:38:17.517
Come on. come on. come on.

612
00:38:17.689 --> 00:38:19.172
I think they make
us look fascist.

613
00:38:20.137 --> 00:38:22.586
It makes us look very
structured. and there's order.

614
00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:24.827
And we're a uniform team.

615
00:38:25.172 --> 00:38:26.618
Why aren't we
talking about Erickson?

616
00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:27.740
We finally have his address.

617
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.342
I think we should just.

618
00:38:29.344 --> 00:38:31.655
just take a step away
from that for a second

619
00:38:31.827 --> 00:38:34.342
to look at some other
ideas that I have.

620
00:38:34.344 --> 00:38:36.342
I think one would be
there's so many lawsuits

621
00:38:36.344 --> 00:38:38.791
and it's insane. you know.

622
00:38:38.793 --> 00:38:40.618
Malpractice is going on
at Ronald Reagan Center.

623
00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:42.413
I think we should
protest the hospital.

624
00:38:43.344 --> 00:38:45.653
I don't want to
vandalize a hospital.

625
00:38:45.655 --> 00:38:46.963
Okay. we'll move on.

626
00:38:46.965 --> 00:38:48.342
There's what. the veterans
associations have been.

627
00:38:48.344 --> 00:38:49.653
you know. people
have been protesting

628
00:38:49.655 --> 00:38:51.101
veterans associations
for so long because-

629
00:38:51.103 --> 00:38:52.480
- That's not what this is about.

630
00:38:52.482 --> 00:38:53.618
You're not understanding this.

631
00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:55.308
I mean. it's not like
we're protesting veterans.

632
00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:57.230
We're protesting the things
that go on at the VA.

633
00:38:57.275 --> 00:38:59.310
They need to understand
what this is nuts.

634
00:38:59.344 --> 00:39:00.344
I mean. don't-

635
00:39:02.034 --> 00:39:03.394
We finally have
Erickson's address.

636
00:39:03.517 --> 00:39:05.032
Why am I a crazy person?

637
00:39:05.034 --> 00:39:06.722
Am I the only one that cares
about what we're doing?

638
00:39:06.724 --> 00:39:07.724
I care.

639
00:39:08.862 --> 00:39:09.687
We'll take care of Herman.

640
00:39:09.689 --> 00:39:11.724
He's obsessed with Herman.

641
00:39:11.896 --> 00:39:14.584
So we just need to make
him feel uncomfortable.

642
00:39:14.586 --> 00:39:15.549
We need to kind of. you know.

643
00:39:15.551 --> 00:39:17.032
get rid of his social
media activity.

644
00:39:17.034 --> 00:39:18.034
What are some ideas?

645
00:39:21.034 --> 00:39:22.379
Kick him in the knees.

646
00:39:23.379 --> 00:39:24.551
I like that. actually.

647
00:39:26.896 --> 00:39:27.894
No. no. no. no. no. no. no.

648
00:39:27.896 --> 00:39:29.170
Not not right now. no I'm sorry.

649
00:39:29.172 --> 00:39:30.206
1966.

650
00:39:31.379 --> 00:39:32.584
16th Street.

651
00:39:32.586 --> 00:39:34.034
You were never on 16th Street.

652
00:39:34.068 --> 00:39:35.239
That's right. we were there.

653
00:39:35.241 --> 00:39:36.411
I'll never forget it.

654
00:39:36.413 --> 00:39:37.275
Why is he standing?

655
00:39:37.379 --> 00:39:39.342
Remember like it
was. what did you say?

656
00:39:39.344 --> 00:39:40.756
Why are you standing?

657
00:39:40.758 --> 00:39:42.517
Because. you're
gonna learn something.

658
00:39:42.896 --> 00:39:44.170
You want to learn something?

659
00:39:44.172 --> 00:39:44.653
Then stop t-

660
00:39:44.655 --> 00:39:45.655
Shut up.

661
00:39:46.379 --> 00:39:48.894
16th Street. there we were.

662
00:39:48.896 --> 00:39:51.172
I remember like
it was yesterday.

663
00:39:51.379 --> 00:39:53.756
And Bill Ayres had
these pins made up.

664
00:39:53.758 --> 00:39:55.825
He got 'em right off the
press. hot off the press.

665
00:39:55.827 --> 00:39:57.239
passed them out to everybody.

666
00:39:57.241 --> 00:39:58.584
Is he even old enough for that?

667
00:39:58.586 --> 00:40:03.068
He wore this suede bandana

668
00:40:03.344 --> 00:40:06.206
that shined like the San
Francisco Bay at twilight.

669
00:40:06.241 --> 00:40:08.687
You were never on 16th Street.

670
00:40:08.689 --> 00:40:11.689
I was on 16th street
in the year in 1966.

671
00:40:11.758 --> 00:40:13.894
with Noam Chomsky.
and Bill Ayres.

672
00:40:13.896 --> 00:40:16.137
and he wore a suede bandana.

673
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.860
Just sit down. just calm down.

674
00:40:18.862 --> 00:40:20.172
Get water or something.

675
00:40:22.655 --> 00:40:23.860
What about you two?

676
00:40:23.862 --> 00:40:24.894
Are you guys got
anything going on here?

677
00:40:24.896 --> 00:40:25.929
What's going on?

678
00:40:25.931 --> 00:40:27.687
Todd. you're just sitting
there doing nothing.

679
00:40:27.689 --> 00:40:29.411
Todd. Todd. do something.

680
00:40:29.413 --> 00:40:31.342
Oh do you want to go first or?

681
00:40:31.344 --> 00:40:32.724
No. just go.

682
00:40:32.862 --> 00:40:33.653
Are you sure?

683
00:40:33.655 --> 00:40:34.724
Yeah. I'm sure.

684
00:40:36.413 --> 00:40:37.894
I can't deal with
you two. either.

685
00:40:37.896 --> 00:40:39.825
This little weird little
thing you guys got going on.

686
00:40:39.827 --> 00:40:41.066
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

687
00:40:41.068 --> 00:40:44.034
There's these
spools in Echo Park.

688
00:40:44.068 --> 00:40:46.825
and Erickson usually
parks his car downhill.

689
00:40:46.827 --> 00:40:48.066
so it's sort of on a slant.

690
00:40:48.068 --> 00:40:50.034
So I was thinking maybe
we could get these spools

691
00:40:50.068 --> 00:40:51.204
and throw them at his car.

692
00:40:51.206 --> 00:40:52.515
No. I don't think
that's a good idea.

693
00:40:52.517 --> 00:40:54.411
I think spools is a dumb idea.

694
00:40:54.413 --> 00:40:56.377
It's sending a message.

695
00:40:56.379 --> 00:40:58.722
but it's also a
little pragmatic.

696
00:40:58.724 --> 00:41:00.411
and you know we're
not getting. you know.

697
00:41:00.413 --> 00:41:01.756
into criminal trouble.

698
00:41:01.758 --> 00:41:03.273
How about we blow
up his fricking car?

699
00:41:03.275 --> 00:41:04.586
Please. this is insane.

700
00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:05.618
Why is that insane?

701
00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:07.101
I think that's a great idea.

702
00:41:07.103 --> 00:41:08.480
He's gonna know that
we're watching him.

703
00:41:08.482 --> 00:41:09.584
and he's gonna start posting

704
00:41:09.586 --> 00:41:11.653
all that frickingat
bullshit on social media.

705
00:41:11.655 --> 00:41:13.793
I think we're gonna
go with the spools.

706
00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:17.135
Yeah. it's just a
political discussion

707
00:41:17.137 --> 00:41:18.411
where everyone gets together.

708
00:41:18.413 --> 00:41:19.963
I am not
sitting in the same room

709
00:41:19.965 --> 00:41:21.135
as a Trump supporter.

710
00:41:21.137 --> 00:41:22.756
Political discussion where
everyone gets together.

711
00:41:22.758 --> 00:41:24.135
I'm sorry. I can't sit

712
00:41:24.137 --> 00:41:25.549
in the same room as a communist.

713
00:41:25.551 --> 00:41:26.241
Discussion?

714
00:41:26.448 --> 00:41:27.929
No. no. no. no.
no. no. no. no. no.

715
00:41:27.931 --> 00:41:29.446
I like conversations
that are actually

716
00:41:29.448 --> 00:41:30.929
the massive
linguistic difference.

717
00:41:30.931 --> 00:41:33.586
I'm sorry. we're not
attending. I'm sorry.

718
00:41:40.793 --> 00:41:42.413
It kind of like roams free.

719
00:41:42.482 --> 00:41:43.724
You're controlling it.

720
00:41:44.103 --> 00:41:45.480
Well yeah. it's the paradox.

721
00:41:45.482 --> 00:41:47.446
You know. there's a
paradox is a paradox.

722
00:41:47.448 --> 00:41:48.135
I am the paradox.

723
00:41:48.137 --> 00:41:49.137
I can't do this.

724
00:41:49.793 --> 00:41:50.793
Naya. I need your help.

725
00:41:59.379 --> 00:42:00.618
Oh. oh my God.

726
00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:01.620
Caesar!

727
00:42:04.827 --> 00:42:07.204
How's your back?

728
00:42:07.206 --> 00:42:09.793
I'll be fine. after
a little carving.

729
00:42:11.551 --> 00:42:13.894
Do you think having
mushrooms at the discussion

730
00:42:13.896 --> 00:42:15.722
is gonna have people
not take me seriously?

731
00:42:15.724 --> 00:42:18.860
No. some of the world's most
influential. powerful people

732
00:42:18.862 --> 00:42:20.482
eat mushrooms on the regular.

733
00:42:20.724 --> 00:42:21.998
You know. they're not
mutually exclusive.

734
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:22.963
You want to have impact.

735
00:42:22.965 --> 00:42:24.791
have impact in all
spheres of your life.

736
00:42:24.793 --> 00:42:26.000
Don't limit your impact.

737
00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:41.620
Hey?

738
00:42:41.655 --> 00:42:43.860
Hey. yeah. I texted
you a couple of times.

739
00:42:43.862 --> 00:42:44.482
Did you get?

740
00:42:44.551 --> 00:42:47.551
Shrooms are looking Mondo.

741
00:42:47.689 --> 00:42:48.998
I just called to remind you

742
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.549
that I'm gonna see you at
the protest tomorrow. right.

743
00:42:50.551 --> 00:42:51.618
with the mushrooms
that I ordered?

744
00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:52.482
9am sharp.

745
00:42:52.551 --> 00:42:54.206
I'm on top of it.
I'm a business guy.

746
00:42:54.482 --> 00:42:55.342
I don't screw up anymore.

747
00:42:55.344 --> 00:42:56.344
I'm-

748
00:42:57.862 --> 00:42:58.862
- Bye.

749
00:43:05.068 --> 00:43:05.756
Hi. how you doing sir?

750
00:43:05.758 --> 00:43:06.758
Hey.

751
00:43:07.275 --> 00:43:08.584
We're getting complaints
about your car over here.

752
00:43:08.586 --> 00:43:10.103
or hose inside your car.

753
00:43:10.448 --> 00:43:11.448
What's that about?

754
00:43:12.103 --> 00:43:15.241
I was gonna gas the
rats out of my attic.

755
00:43:15.586 --> 00:43:16.793
Oh really?

756
00:43:16.931 --> 00:43:19.101
And how are you gonna do that
with that hose on your car?

757
00:43:19.103 --> 00:43:21.273
I was gonna-same way humans
kill themselves.

758
00:43:21.275 --> 00:43:22.896
I was gonna run exhaust.

759
00:43:23.103 --> 00:43:26.068
Okay. I find that
a little strange.

760
00:43:27.793 --> 00:43:29.551
I don't know man.
this neighbor Derek.

761
00:43:29.896 --> 00:43:31.377
he's got the cops involved now.

762
00:43:31.379 --> 00:43:32.724
They showed up at my house.

763
00:43:32.793 --> 00:43:35.034
Nah man. you can't
have police around.

764
00:43:36.724 --> 00:43:38.103
I haven't even done anything.

765
00:43:38.275 --> 00:43:40.724
I just ran a hose from
the exhaust to the attic.

766
00:43:40.896 --> 00:43:42.206
Didn't turn the power on.

767
00:43:42.448 --> 00:43:43.931
Wasn't gassing anything.

768
00:43:44.379 --> 00:43:45.586
A man can do that.

769
00:43:45.724 --> 00:43:47.758
Yeah. no harm
there. case closed.

770
00:43:49.034 --> 00:43:50.034
How's your kafta?

771
00:43:51.068 --> 00:43:52.068
Good.

772
00:43:53.275 --> 00:43:54.862
I got Manny on delivery. man.

773
00:43:54.896 --> 00:43:56.066
I'm doing things differently.

774
00:43:56.068 --> 00:43:57.448
I'm showing up.

775
00:43:57.896 --> 00:44:00.066
I'm going to tell someone
I'm gonna sell them drugs

776
00:44:00.068 --> 00:44:01.482
at 9:00 a.m.. and guess what?

777
00:44:01.517 --> 00:44:03.342
I'm gonna call them at 8:59.

778
00:44:03.344 --> 00:44:05.135
Another
bottle of wine gentlemen?

779
00:44:05.137 --> 00:44:07.137
No. thanks. I think we're
gonna have a white night.

780
00:44:40.448 --> 00:44:42.275
Is someone at the door?

781
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.200
How can I help you today. sir?

782
00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:48.998
I didn't call the police.

783
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.827
Did somebody call
the police on me?

784
00:44:51.655 --> 00:44:53.827
Got a call.

785
00:44:56.655 --> 00:44:57.482
Me. I'm good.

786
00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:59.172
Okay. all right sir.

787
00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:01.204
- Well. have a good day.
- Okay.

788
00:45:01.206 --> 00:45:01.998
Bye. take care.

789
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.689
- Thank you.
- Bye.

790
00:45:35.655 --> 00:45:37.034
Hey Boyle. this is Naya.

791
00:45:38.172 --> 00:45:40.482
Hi. I'm on Sixth and
Spring. where are you?

792
00:45:40.724 --> 00:45:42.344
I'm on my way. 15 minutes.

793
00:45:42.379 --> 00:45:44.241
Yeah. I'm in the car.

794
00:45:44.413 --> 00:45:46.172
See you in 15 minutes.

795
00:45:46.551 --> 00:45:48.724
Drugs are menacing our society.

796
00:45:48.862 --> 00:45:50.102
They're threatening our values-

797
00:46:03.931 --> 00:46:04.722
We gotta go.

798
00:46:04.724 --> 00:46:05.896
All right. let's go.

799
00:46:14.896 --> 00:46:15.963
What's your damage?

800
00:46:15.965 --> 00:46:17.965
I gotta.

801
00:46:19.068 --> 00:46:20.480
Get your fucking jacket on man.

802
00:46:20.482 --> 00:46:21.620
I'm covered in filth.

803
00:46:35.137 --> 00:46:37.137
Where the fuck are you?

804
00:46:37.448 --> 00:46:39.655
It's. we're uh.

805
00:46:40.896 --> 00:46:41.965
is it on?

806
00:46:42.172 --> 00:46:43.480
I was walking around for an hour

807
00:46:43.482 --> 00:46:44.482
trying to find you.

808
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.286
We're on our way.
we're on our away.

809
00:46:46.310 --> 00:46:47.310
We're almost there.

810
00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:48.872
We're there. we're almost there.

811
00:46:48.896 --> 00:46:49.896
Bye.

812
00:46:56.827 --> 00:46:58.068
Where is it?

813
00:46:58.310 --> 00:47:01.689
I don't know.

814
00:47:24.862 --> 00:47:26.170
If you don't want to come sir.

815
00:47:26.172 --> 00:47:28.066
why do you want him to be
the only one with guns?

816
00:47:28.068 --> 00:47:31.034
Man. that is not nice. I'm here.

817
00:47:31.758 --> 00:47:33.655
There's no reason
to flip me off.

818
00:49:01.827 --> 00:49:02.653
Where are you?

819
00:49:02.655 --> 00:49:03.825
I'm outside at Sixth and Spring.

820
00:49:03.827 --> 00:49:05.448
I'm outside of the protest.

821
00:49:06.827 --> 00:49:08.655
I'm the only one with pink hair.

822
00:49:46.517 --> 00:49:47.517
Where the hell were you?

823
00:49:47.655 --> 00:49:48.655
I don't know.

824
00:49:50.517 --> 00:49:51.446
I'm really freaked
out right now.

825
00:49:51.448 --> 00:49:52.308
Why?

826
00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:53.310
I don't know.

827
00:49:55.206 --> 00:49:56.480
Since you're here
are you gonna help me?

828
00:49:56.482 --> 00:49:57.689
No no no no no no.

829
00:49:58.655 --> 00:49:59.655
You said you were.

830
00:50:00.827 --> 00:50:01.827
I haven't slept.

831
00:50:03.137 --> 00:50:04.137
Okay fine.

832
00:50:37.137 --> 00:50:38.929
I don't know. maybe I'm
too much in my head about it.

833
00:50:38.931 --> 00:50:39.931
but I'm just.

834
00:50:40.344 --> 00:50:41.653
I'm just worried that
it's just gonna be

835
00:50:41.655 --> 00:50:45.103
some small gathering
where no one shows up.

836
00:50:45.827 --> 00:50:47.653
Well. I'm worried
I'm not gonna be able

837
00:50:47.655 --> 00:50:49.344
to shit for two weeks
because of my back.

838
00:50:49.448 --> 00:50:50.998
I don't know. maybe
I should just join

839
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.653
some big political organization

840
00:50:53.655 --> 00:50:56.825
where I'm bound to have a
large impact. or something.

841
00:50:56.827 --> 00:50:59.135
Naya. I think there's
enough morons out there

842
00:50:59.137 --> 00:51:00.377
that you don't need to do that.

843
00:51:00.655 --> 00:51:01.825
You're great. you're wonderful.

844
00:51:01.827 --> 00:51:02.860
Bring your own spark.

845
00:51:02.862 --> 00:51:04.689
bring your own energy
to the discussion.

846
00:51:07.758 --> 00:51:08.758
I don't know.

847
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.342
To feel my heart pin my ego

848
00:51:14.344 --> 00:51:16.517
for one open
timeless was moment.

849
00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:19.411
and the strange uncomfortable
space it created

850
00:51:19.413 --> 00:51:21.379
experience all joy.

851
00:51:22.448 --> 00:51:23.724
add some movement.

852
00:51:36.344 --> 00:51:37.722
Hi Naya. I know I said

853
00:51:37.724 --> 00:51:39.931
I could attend the discussion.

854
00:51:40.241 --> 00:51:43.206
but I don't think I can
anymore. I'm so sorry.

855
00:52:22.965 --> 00:52:24.756
That was the worst
idea Todd ever had.

856
00:52:24.758 --> 00:52:25.963
We didn't even
hit the right car.

857
00:52:25.965 --> 00:52:27.034
Deviled eggs.

858
00:52:28.344 --> 00:52:29.756
so delicious.

859
00:52:29.758 --> 00:52:31.170
The car's done. the car's done.

860
00:52:31.172 --> 00:52:32.655
No. it's not done.

861
00:52:32.689 --> 00:52:34.620
We need to do what I've
been saying all along.

862
00:52:34.896 --> 00:52:36.620
We blow up his fricking car.

863
00:52:36.655 --> 00:52:37.963
It's the perfect idea.

864
00:52:37.965 --> 00:52:39.342
He's gonna get freaked out.

865
00:52:39.344 --> 00:52:40.446
He's gonna leave town.

866
00:52:40.448 --> 00:52:42.308
We're not gonna
hurt him or anybody.

867
00:52:42.310 --> 00:52:43.687
We're just gonna
hurt his dumb car.

868
00:52:43.689 --> 00:52:44.618
We gotta stick to
the original plan

869
00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:46.448
doing social media

870
00:52:46.586 --> 00:52:48.066
and then getting a
presence out there.

871
00:52:48.482 --> 00:52:49.446
this kind of stuff.

872
00:52:49.448 --> 00:52:51.618
Noam Chomsky loved deviled eggs.

873
00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:52.793
Emmanuel stop.

874
00:52:53.172 --> 00:52:55.000
You shouldn't shout like that.

875
00:52:55.137 --> 00:52:56.551
Okay. thanks.

876
00:52:56.965 --> 00:52:58.825
Your obsession with social media

877
00:52:58.827 --> 00:53:01.034
is making us look
crazier and crazier.

878
00:53:01.137 --> 00:53:02.963
It's what the media
wants us to look like.

879
00:53:02.965 --> 00:53:04.377
We don't need to
be on social media.

880
00:53:04.379 --> 00:53:05.819
What are you accusing
me of. comrade?

881
00:53:07.379 --> 00:53:08.379
Eat a Dick.

882
00:53:10.724 --> 00:53:11.860
You're leaving?

883
00:53:11.862 --> 00:53:13.206
Yeah. Todd?

884
00:53:13.862 --> 00:53:15.000
I'm coming.

885
00:53:15.896 --> 00:53:16.620
Fuck you. Todd.

886
00:53:16.862 --> 00:53:19.275
You frivolous little weasel.

887
00:53:20.551 --> 00:53:21.860
Don't come too close.

888
00:53:21.862 --> 00:53:24.549
I remember Noam
Chomsky telling me.

889
00:53:24.551 --> 00:53:29.310
I told him something that he
tells me still to this day.

890
00:53:29.896 --> 00:53:31.379
And what he said.

891
00:53:31.413 --> 00:53:34.068
was what I said to him
is what he said to me.

892
00:53:34.137 --> 00:53:36.860
And what I told him.
is what he told me.

893
00:53:36.862 --> 00:53:38.377
And he told him. he told him.

894
00:53:38.379 --> 00:53:39.620
And I told him this.

895
00:53:40.862 --> 00:53:43.344
Milk is good.

896
00:53:44.068 --> 00:53:48.655
But. cream is great.

897
00:53:48.862 --> 00:53:51.172
Emmanuel. shut the fuck up.

898
00:53:51.241 --> 00:53:53.344
I mean. everything's
just falling apart. here.

899
00:53:53.379 --> 00:53:55.000
They leave and it's
just me and you like.

900
00:53:55.034 --> 00:53:55.860
this is terrible.

901
00:53:55.862 --> 00:53:57.377
Terrific!

902
00:53:57.379 --> 00:53:58.379
You're gonna be terrific.

903
00:53:58.482 --> 00:54:00.482
when you shut the fuck up
Emmanuel. how about that?

904
00:54:03.241 --> 00:54:04.586
Get the fuck out.

905
00:54:14.448 --> 00:54:15.756
Hey. what's up Boyle?

906
00:54:15.758 --> 00:54:16.756
It's Ceas.

907
00:54:16.758 --> 00:54:17.894
Hey. a favor to ask.

908
00:54:17.896 --> 00:54:20.549
Can you come grab this
big sphere for my friend?

909
00:54:20.551 --> 00:54:22.931
Yeah. yeah. it's like
stressing Naya out.

910
00:54:23.931 --> 00:54:25.586
All right. cool man. thank you.

911
00:55:19.862 --> 00:55:21.137
Sometimes smaller is better.

912
00:55:27.448 --> 00:55:28.482
How's your back?

913
00:55:29.172 --> 00:55:30.310
I think it might be broken.

914
00:55:39.586 --> 00:55:40.793
Good Mondo.

915
00:56:19.413 --> 00:56:21.239
I want to add tears

916
00:56:21.241 --> 00:56:24.549
with our drinks. our
holistic peace medicine.

917
00:56:24.551 --> 00:56:27.206
AKA magic mushrooms. so cheers.

918
00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:31.170
Something we're
here to talk about

919
00:56:31.172 --> 00:56:34.549
is Trump versus the
intelligence agencies.

920
00:56:34.551 --> 00:56:36.344
and now this shift.

921
00:56:36.379 --> 00:56:38.825
Being a Republican I
traditionally support

922
00:56:38.827 --> 00:56:40.342
our intelligence agencies.

923
00:56:40.344 --> 00:56:41.860
Being a veteran and
the wife of a veteran.

924
00:56:41.862 --> 00:56:44.377
I'm very disappointed
that we invaded Iraq.

925
00:56:44.379 --> 00:56:45.724
for basically nothing.

926
00:56:45.758 --> 00:56:47.032
It's convenient for the left

927
00:56:47.034 --> 00:56:49.379
to trust the CIA now.

928
00:56:49.413 --> 00:56:51.586
and it's convenient for
the right to distrust them.

929
00:56:51.655 --> 00:56:53.586
So it's politics.

930
00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:56.206
Now who is always being hurt?

931
00:56:56.241 --> 00:56:57.241
Poor people.

932
00:56:58.965 --> 00:56:59.894
I think I took too much

933
00:56:59.896 --> 00:57:00.965
of that potion.

934
00:57:13.310 --> 00:57:15.342
I mixed a bottle
of. it's part water.

935
00:57:15.344 --> 00:57:19.549
part liquid antacid and make
some liquid antacid water.

936
00:57:19.551 --> 00:57:21.413
And I call it L-A-W. law.

937
00:57:21.482 --> 00:57:22.963
So we can. we can just
put it on our eyes.

938
00:57:22.965 --> 00:57:24.241
and be a pepper spray.

939
00:57:24.896 --> 00:57:26.135
Here. I made it for you.

940
00:57:26.137 --> 00:57:27.135
Thanks.

941
00:57:27.137 --> 00:57:28.241
All right.

942
00:57:28.379 --> 00:57:29.379
Okay.

943
00:57:29.413 --> 00:57:31.584
Just like take a breath.
don't be a creep.

944
00:57:31.586 --> 00:57:32.137
Oh.

945
00:57:32.586 --> 00:57:34.137
Like we have to do that.

946
00:57:35.586 --> 00:57:36.480
Yeah. no I didn't.

947
00:57:36.482 --> 00:57:37.965
I didn't mean to be creepy.

948
00:57:38.586 --> 00:57:41.448
This is the road that
we're gonna be on. okay.

949
00:57:41.482 --> 00:57:42.998
And this is where
Herman's car is parked.

950
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.963
It's always parked here.
in this corner right here.

951
00:57:44.965 --> 00:57:45.618
You see it.

952
00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:46.413
It was simple.

953
00:57:46.586 --> 00:57:48.411
And then here's you
with your dumb hair.

954
00:57:48.413 --> 00:57:51.066
and here's me and okay.

955
00:57:51.068 --> 00:57:52.135
And then you're gonna be holding

956
00:57:52.137 --> 00:57:53.894
the Molotov cocktails. okay?

957
00:57:53.896 --> 00:57:55.135
Hold them close to you.

958
00:57:55.137 --> 00:57:56.137
They're very dangerous.

959
00:57:56.172 --> 00:57:57.618
And like. I don't want
them to near my hair.

960
00:57:57.620 --> 00:57:59.308
And then what's gonna happen is.

961
00:57:59.310 --> 00:58:01.517
we're just gonna casually
stroll over to the car.

962
00:58:01.689 --> 00:58:02.689
just walk.

963
00:58:03.551 --> 00:58:05.206
I'm gonna light these.

964
00:58:05.482 --> 00:58:07.032
and then we're gonna
throw them at the car.

965
00:58:07.034 --> 00:58:09.793
and then we have 30
seconds. and then. bam!

966
00:58:10.206 --> 00:58:11.310
Explosion!

967
00:58:11.379 --> 00:58:13.517
Explosion. fire!

968
00:58:14.689 --> 00:58:17.034
And then you're gonna go east.

969
00:58:17.068 --> 00:58:18.170
and I'm gonna go west.

970
00:58:18.172 --> 00:58:19.965
and then that's gonna
be that for that.

971
00:58:21.551 --> 00:58:23.034
Does that make sense?

972
00:58:23.379 --> 00:58:25.034
Yeah. I mean. I
can also go west.

973
00:58:25.206 --> 00:58:26.206
No.

974
00:58:26.517 --> 00:58:28.825
Oh. for like safety
we'll split up?

975
00:58:28.827 --> 00:58:30.034
Yeah. it's for safety.

976
00:58:32.344 --> 00:58:34.000
Cool. it sounds like a plan.

977
00:58:35.517 --> 00:58:38.034
What. it doesn't sound
like a plan. it is a plan.

978
00:58:38.310 --> 00:58:42.310
We're not planning a surprise
party for your grandma. Todd.

979
00:58:42.862 --> 00:58:44.032
Yeah. no no.
that's what I meant.

980
00:58:44.034 --> 00:58:46.963
I just been like. I feel
like it's a good plan.

981
00:58:46.965 --> 00:58:47.860
It's a good plan.

982
00:58:47.862 --> 00:58:48.862
I'm excited to do this.

983
00:58:49.206 --> 00:58:50.551
Okay. you're excited?

984
00:58:50.655 --> 00:58:52.344
Yeah. I like to blow
stuff up with you.

985
00:58:56.379 --> 00:58:57.862
- I really like you.
- I hate you.

986
00:59:02.241 --> 00:59:04.549
Capitalism when truly
tried. never fails.

987
00:59:04.551 --> 00:59:05.722
it works all the time.

988
00:59:05.724 --> 00:59:08.756
This capitalistic system
that's purely based off.

989
00:59:08.758 --> 00:59:09.758
you know what?

990
00:59:09.896 --> 00:59:11.618
Everything starts to funnel
its way up to the top.

991
00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:14.204
I seriously ask does that
give you more choices or not?

992
00:59:14.206 --> 00:59:15.618
You think that
any of this matters

993
00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:16.740
unless we find the narwhals.

994
00:59:17.965 --> 00:59:20.862
Okay. so the year is
1955. Dimitri Mischkin.

995
00:59:21.034 --> 00:59:22.862
working for the Russian
government. right?

996
00:59:22.931 --> 00:59:23.860
You have this problem. right?

997
00:59:23.862 --> 00:59:24.965
You can't put the subs.

998
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.446
you can't put the nukes
on the subs anymore.

999
00:59:26.448 --> 00:59:27.896
So they create NARWALS.

1000
00:59:28.068 --> 00:59:32.275
Navel. atomic. radio wave
hidden. autonomous logic systems.

1001
00:59:32.482 --> 00:59:34.618
that swim around.
no one can tell

1002
00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:35.931
that they're fucking nukes.

1003
00:59:36.206 --> 00:59:37.894
And then you have. you
your little tusks. right?

1004
00:59:37.896 --> 00:59:39.894
The tusks how they
get the information

1005
00:59:39.896 --> 00:59:41.379
from both Russia and the US.

1006
00:59:41.448 --> 00:59:42.931
Dimitri comes to the US.

1007
00:59:42.965 --> 00:59:45.125
brings all that information
to the American government.

1008
00:59:45.310 --> 00:59:46.618
We all have to be hoping

1009
00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:48.929
that Trump and Putin
actually get along.

1010
00:59:48.931 --> 00:59:51.620
because that's the only chance
we have of finding them all.

1011
00:59:51.655 --> 00:59:53.034
That's where it's coming from.

1012
00:59:53.206 --> 00:59:54.758
It's all coming
up to the surface.

1013
00:59:55.862 --> 00:59:57.931
into the clouds.
man. making it rain.

1014
01:00:00.586 --> 01:00:01.963
He made a promise.

1015
01:00:01.965 --> 01:00:04.273
he made a campaign promise
to overturn Roe v Wade.

1016
01:00:04.275 --> 01:00:05.835
and we are now at
the precipice of that.

1017
01:00:06.275 --> 01:00:07.549
Then there was the Green Party.

1018
01:00:07.551 --> 01:00:08.239
then there was democrats.

1019
01:00:08.241 --> 01:00:09.480
That's our five parties.

1020
01:00:09.482 --> 01:00:10.618
What would end up happening is.

1021
01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:12.101
they'd all have about
20-something percent.

1022
01:00:12.103 --> 01:00:13.586
And then the tea parties...

1023
01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:29.241
Why is everyone looking at me?

1024
01:00:47.931 --> 01:00:50.206
Reciprocal. reciprocal.

1025
01:00:50.241 --> 01:00:54.241
reciprocal.
reciprocal. reciprocal.

1026
01:00:57.379 --> 01:00:58.379
Reciprocal.

1027
01:00:58.413 --> 01:00:59.687
Reciprocal.

1028
01:00:59.689 --> 01:01:01.482
I love the word. reciprocal.

1029
01:01:01.655 --> 01:01:03.620
Reciprocal. such
an important word.

1030
01:01:04.206 --> 01:01:06.653
Reciprocal. reciprocal.

1031
01:01:06.655 --> 01:01:08.032
reciprocal. a word
that you're gonna hear

1032
01:01:08.034 --> 01:01:10.482
more and more coming
from this administration.

1033
01:01:12.896 --> 01:01:15.482
I would right
now in the State Senate.

1034
01:01:21.689 --> 01:01:22.827
Bye guys.

1035
01:01:34.275 --> 01:01:35.758
Fucking narwhals. be careful.

1036
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.680
These are heavier than
I thought they'd be.

1037
01:01:55.827 --> 01:01:57.342
I feel like they're
splashing on me.

1038
01:01:57.344 --> 01:01:58.135
Shut the fuck up.

1039
01:01:58.137 --> 01:01:59.170
They're spilling on me.

1040
01:01:59.172 --> 01:01:59.756
Stop.

1041
01:01:59.758 --> 01:02:00.896
I'm sorry.

1042
01:02:05.275 --> 01:02:06.377
I'm sorry.

1043
01:02:06.379 --> 01:02:07.379
I'm sorry.

1044
01:02:08.172 --> 01:02:09.379
I. I can't do this.

1045
01:02:09.517 --> 01:02:12.206
I mean. I have a weak
constitution. I'm sorry.

1046
01:03:31.793 --> 01:03:33.724
Hope they got the message.

1047
01:03:41.965 --> 01:03:42.620
What's up. Boyle?

1048
01:03:42.896 --> 01:03:43.965
Hey Daphne.

1049
01:03:51.137 --> 01:03:52.241
Far out.

1050
01:04:59.379 --> 01:05:03.584
The energy.
the ambition. the rejection.

1051
01:05:03.586 --> 01:05:08.413
the joy and jubilation.
the Dreamers.

1052
01:05:53.448 --> 01:05:54.724
Have you been crying?

1053
01:06:01.793 --> 01:06:02.965
I'm practicing lines.

1054
01:06:06.793 --> 01:06:08.310
We all dream. don't we?

1055
01:07:01.034 --> 01:07:02.722
Tell me about this.
I want your feedback.

1056
01:07:02.724 --> 01:07:04.000
Oh. totally.

1057
01:07:05.551 --> 01:07:07.034
Will it knock me out?

1058
01:07:10.206 --> 01:07:11.515
So what are you
boys up to. tonight?

1059
01:07:11.517 --> 01:07:12.724
Cubs-Dodgers game.

1060
01:07:13.241 --> 01:07:14.241
Baseball.

1061
01:07:25.344 --> 01:07:26.722
Go Dodgers.

1062
01:07:26.724 --> 01:07:27.827
Go Cubs.

1063
01:07:28.172 --> 01:07:29.206
Bye.

1064
01:07:55.068 --> 01:07:56.068
My grandmother.

1065
01:07:56.896 --> 01:07:58.000
She was an actress. too.

1066
01:07:58.793 --> 01:08:02.101
Actually. she was the
stand in for Grace Kelly

1067
01:08:02.103 --> 01:08:03.998
in the movie. "High
Society" with Bing Crosby.

1068
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.620
and they became
really good friends.

1069
01:08:08.310 --> 01:08:09.586
She never made it though.

1070
01:08:11.241 --> 01:08:13.281
Pretty sure I'm the last
one left with her headshot.

1071
01:08:18.344 --> 01:08:20.620
Oh. that's my manager.
One second.

1072
01:08:22.274 --> 01:08:23.274
Hi. Xander.

1073
01:08:23.724 --> 01:08:25.241
Xander. over here.

1074
01:08:25.448 --> 01:08:27.585
Smile. Xander. smile.

1075
01:08:27.655 --> 01:08:31.274
Here at the BGA viewing
party for the Academy Awards.

1076
01:08:31.792 --> 01:08:33.241
You know. I don't
have any clients

1077
01:08:33.309 --> 01:08:34.446
in there this year.

1078
01:08:34.448 --> 01:08:36.309
Had a lot of clients up
for the roles. though.

1079
01:08:36.655 --> 01:08:38.068
You know. which is a good thing.

1080
01:08:48.274 --> 01:08:49.724
Filming. we're good friends.

1081
01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:02.482
Can I get a vodka. please?

1082
01:09:05.482 --> 01:09:06.482
I'm fine.

1083
01:09:20.172 --> 01:09:22.135
You're nothing in this town
without your representation.

1084
01:09:22.137 --> 01:09:23.482
and you know.

1085
01:09:24.862 --> 01:09:26.517
I'm really lucky to
have Xander Hischier.

1086
01:09:40.862 --> 01:09:44.033
My name is Barry Shay.
and I'm a personal trainer.

1087
01:09:44.379 --> 01:09:46.894
and that helps me a lot
to stay in the game.

1088
01:09:46.896 --> 01:09:49.724
You better have your shit
together. excuse my language.

1089
01:09:49.896 --> 01:09:51.998
But that's the only way
you're gonna have a chance

1090
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.482
to get your big break.

1091
01:09:53.655 --> 01:09:54.344
Okay?

1092
01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:56.687
But if you're a fat.
out-of-shape person.

1093
01:09:56.689 --> 01:09:58.379
how you gonna have a future?

1094
01:09:58.585 --> 01:10:01.000
This is only for the
fittest and the strongest.

1095
01:10:06.309 --> 01:10:08.689
With a healthy mind
and a healthy body.

1096
01:10:09.206 --> 01:10:11.137
nothing can stop you. Nothing.

1097
01:10:11.550 --> 01:10:12.793
I believe that.

1098
01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:27.689
Let's begin.

1099
01:10:34.724 --> 01:10:36.000
What's the matter with you?

1100
01:10:38.034 --> 01:10:39.965
I'll kill myself
the same way soon.

1101
01:10:41.862 --> 01:10:43.309
I hardly recognize you.

1102
01:10:44.206 --> 01:10:45.827
I hardly recognize you.

1103
01:10:46.309 --> 01:10:49.000
You've changed towards
me. your eyes are so cold.

1104
01:10:50.517 --> 01:10:52.655
My presence embarrasses you.

1105
01:11:00.172 --> 01:11:01.413
What does that mean?

1106
01:11:02.931 --> 01:11:06.206
I was vile enough to
kill a seagull today.

1107
01:11:06.585 --> 01:11:07.724
I lay it at your feet.

1108
01:11:07.931 --> 01:11:09.689
What's the matter with you?

1109
01:11:11.550 --> 01:11:14.896
One full order of
Singapore Street Noodles.

1110
01:11:24.034 --> 01:11:27.000
A few months from now.
this is gonna be a gym.

1111
01:11:27.896 --> 01:11:28.931
Right there.

1112
01:11:31.413 --> 01:11:33.585
Barry's Gym. a glittering sign.

1113
01:11:34.379 --> 01:11:35.379
Come on in.

1114
01:11:36.241 --> 01:11:37.724
Let's get some lights on.

1115
01:11:44.585 --> 01:11:47.756
Me and the Missus. we talked
about this all the time.

1116
01:11:47.758 --> 01:11:49.032
I just didn't have enough money.

1117
01:11:49.034 --> 01:11:50.963
but now I got the money honey.

1118
01:11:50.965 --> 01:11:53.411
and we're gonna have
this place up in no time.

1119
01:11:53.413 --> 01:11:54.307
You know?

1120
01:11:54.309 --> 01:11:55.722
Right here. in Hollywood.

1121
01:11:55.724 --> 01:11:57.411
Can you believe it. man?

1122
01:11:57.413 --> 01:11:59.931
We'll put a punching
bag over here. right?

1123
01:12:05.517 --> 01:12:07.448
Thinking of kettle
bells over here. right?

1124
01:12:10.827 --> 01:12:14.827
Exclusive Hollywood
stars. right?

1125
01:12:14.965 --> 01:12:17.309
This place ain't no
dive. man. no no.

1126
01:12:29.309 --> 01:12:30.793
I hardly recognize you.

1127
01:12:32.275 --> 01:12:34.655
You've changed towards
me. your eyes are so cold.

1128
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.170
You're either looking
at the dead bird

1129
01:12:36.172 --> 01:12:37.413
or at his stupid face.

1130
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Hey. look at his
stupid fucking face.

1131
01:12:41.172 --> 01:12:43.655
Look at that stupid
fucking face.

1132
01:12:43.827 --> 01:12:46.172
Look at his stupid fucking face.

1133
01:12:46.206 --> 01:12:48.137
I don't have to
take this anymore!

1134
01:12:57.827 --> 01:12:59.655
I was on "Mad About You" for.

1135
01:13:00.034 --> 01:13:03.724
with Paul Reiser and Helen
Hunt. for two seasons.

1136
01:13:06.034 --> 01:13:07.550
Do you think they hired me

1137
01:13:08.068 --> 01:13:10.896
because I delivered my
lines looking at my feet?

1138
01:13:13.379 --> 01:13:16.034
I am a real actress.

1139
01:13:17.344 --> 01:13:18.896
I enjoy it.

1140
01:13:19.827 --> 01:13:21.896
I revel in it.

1141
01:13:23.758 --> 01:13:26.000
I am intoxicated on the stage.

1142
01:13:27.931 --> 01:13:29.550
I feel beautiful there.

1143
01:13:33.689 --> 01:13:36.172
And Mad About You fucking sucks!

1144
01:13:38.275 --> 01:13:39.689
Kara. you're up.

1145
01:13:40.585 --> 01:13:43.758
Ken. this is a man on the
verge of killing himself.

1146
01:13:44.379 --> 01:13:46.068
I want you to go into the hall.

1147
01:13:46.448 --> 01:13:47.827
put that gun in your mouth.

1148
01:13:48.379 --> 01:13:50.724
and think about blowing
your dumb fucking head off.

1149
01:14:09.137 --> 01:14:11.068
This show is so fucking good.

1150
01:14:22.344 --> 01:14:23.550

So as long as you get me the

Sure.

1170
01:15:16.517 --> 01:15:18.550
Hey Espar. Espar.

1171
01:15:18.896 --> 01:15:21.480
Did I ever tell you
about my running race

1172
01:15:21.482 --> 01:15:23.825
in Central Park in 1986?

1173
01:15:23.827 --> 01:15:25.034
This was a 10 miler.

1174
01:15:25.309 --> 01:15:27.135
Yeah. them were the days.

1175
01:15:27.137 --> 01:15:29.965
Well. now I'm still running.
and I'm still in the game.

1176
01:15:34.482 --> 01:15:36.344
Hey Boyle. I need to
ask you something.

1177
01:15:37.206 --> 01:15:38.206
What's up?

1178
01:15:38.862 --> 01:15:41.480
You know that gym I had
my eye on all this time.

1179
01:15:41.482 --> 01:15:43.653
well I finally found
the place. it's great.

1180
01:15:43.655 --> 01:15:45.411
but I need some more clients.

1181
01:15:45.413 --> 01:15:46.689
Can you refer me some?

1182
01:15:46.827 --> 01:15:47.862

That'd be great.

1185
01:15:49.206 --> 01:15:50.204

1186
01:15:50.206 --> 01:15:51.620

1187
01:15:51.793 --> 01:15:54.377
and it'll be a good thing. man.

1188
01:15:54.379 --> 01:15:55.825
They drink too much soda.

1189
01:15:55.827 --> 01:15:58.239
Oh yeah. they drink all
that crap. it's crazy.

1190
01:15:58.241 --> 01:16:01.411
All that corn syrup
stuff and fat.

1191
01:16:01.413 --> 01:16:02.446
Yeah. yeah.

1192
01:16:02.448 --> 01:16:03.585
I don't drink it anymore.

1193
01:16:03.965 --> 01:16:06.241
Yeah. well you know what?

1194
01:16:07.448 --> 01:16:12.068
I got $25.000 already.
but I need 5.000 now.

1195
01:16:12.103 --> 01:16:12.894
You need 5.000?

1196
01:16:12.896 --> 01:16:13.860
I need 5.000.

1197
01:16:13.862 --> 01:16:14.756
You want me to lend it to you?

1198
01:16:14.758 --> 01:16:15.618
Can you do that?

1199
01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:16.275
Oh yeah!

1200
01:16:16.413 --> 01:16:17.413
All right.

1201
01:16:17.758 --> 01:16:18.446
That'd be awesome.

1202
01:16:18.448 --> 01:16:19.860
I appreciate that.

1203
01:16:19.862 --> 01:16:21.000
Anything for you. Barry.

1204
01:16:41.517 --> 01:16:42.413
Hey Armen?

1205
01:16:42.448 --> 01:16:44.101
Here it is!

1206
01:16:44.103 --> 01:16:46.550
It's Barry. the champion!

1207
01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:51.241
You are good businessman.

1208
01:16:51.585 --> 01:16:52.724
You are man of your word.

1209
01:16:52.931 --> 01:16:54.241
Damn right I am.

1210
01:17:01.482 --> 01:17:02.585
Hey Armen?

1211
01:17:02.827 --> 01:17:04.172
It's Barry again.

1212
01:17:04.482 --> 01:17:05.482
Talk to you later.

1213
01:17:07.517 --> 01:17:09.480
Hey. this guy is really big.

1214
01:17:09.482 --> 01:17:11.135
He must be major player.

1215
01:17:11.137 --> 01:17:13.655
He's always on the phone.
never returns my calls.

1216
01:17:13.827 --> 01:17:15.137
All right. bye.

1217
01:17:16.172 --> 01:17:17.931
Property not listed.

1218
01:17:20.206 --> 01:17:23.137
Oh shit. Espar. Espar
did you hear that?

1219
01:17:23.448 --> 01:17:25.480
These yokels at the
bank are telling me

1220
01:17:25.482 --> 01:17:26.965
the property's not listed.

1221
01:17:50.206 --> 01:17:51.448
Hey Armen?

1222
01:17:52.448 --> 01:17:53.756
Some mix-up at the bank.

1223
01:17:53.758 --> 01:17:54.758
Barry. oh...

1224
01:17:55.517 --> 01:17:56.825
There is always
mix up at the bank.

1225
01:17:56.827 --> 01:17:58.655
The information's all wrong.

1226
01:17:59.379 --> 01:18:00.825
Yes. red tape.

1227
01:18:00.827 --> 01:18:02.344
I want to see
the property. okay?

1228
01:18:03.241 --> 01:18:05.068
Property is
unavailable. it's sold.

1229
01:18:05.585 --> 01:18:07.860
What? I gave you the money.

1230
01:18:07.862 --> 01:18:09.206
You gave me the
money to hold it.

1231
01:18:09.413 --> 01:18:10.618
Someone came with better offer.

1232
01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:12.756
I gave you the money to hold it.

1233
01:18:12.758 --> 01:18:14.241
You gave me chump change.

1234
01:18:15.241 --> 01:18:16.482
Someone came with better offer.

1235
01:18:16.517 --> 01:18:17.583
I take offer.

1236
01:18:17.585 --> 01:18:19.172
It was all the money I had.

1237
01:18:19.413 --> 01:18:20.724
You're a sad man.

1238
01:18:20.827 --> 01:18:23.724
And your idea was stupid.

1239
01:18:23.931 --> 01:18:24.931
You know what?

1240
01:18:25.068 --> 01:18:26.344
You fuckin' asshole.

1241
01:18:27.550 --> 01:18:28.517
Fuck you. pal.

1242
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:30.032
Okay. fuck you.

1243
01:18:30.034 --> 01:18:33.068
Barry. leave me now.

1244
01:18:33.413 --> 01:18:35.034
Don't embarrass yourself.

1245
01:18:42.309 --> 01:18:43.309
Asshole.

1246
01:19:21.344 --> 01:19:22.724
What do you think. Comet?

1247
01:19:25.758 --> 01:19:26.758
I didn't get it.

1248
01:19:29.413 --> 01:19:31.034
I didn't get the part.

1249
01:19:37.413 --> 01:19:38.793
Don't bite. mommy.

1250
01:19:39.482 --> 01:19:40.965
I have something to show you.

1251
01:19:43.413 --> 01:19:44.583
What am I gonna do. huh?

1252
01:19:44.585 --> 01:19:46.724
What can I do now?

1253
01:19:49.137 --> 01:19:50.137
Shit.

1254
01:21:02.550 --> 01:21:06.448
When in wait. I cried
the dream again.

1255
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.446
Ladies and gentlemen.
grandson of great. Bing Crosby.

1256
01:22:14.448 --> 01:22:16.206
Bill Crosby. Junior.

1257
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.137
Hey Boyle?

1258
01:23:24.275 --> 01:23:25.413
I'm here.

1259
01:23:54.344 --> 01:23:55.929
I got a big time investor

1260
01:23:55.931 --> 01:23:57.827
looking into Barry's
Gym. big time.

1261
01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.275
- Big time?
- Yeah. yeah.

1262
01:23:59.448 --> 01:24:01.032
- That's awesome.
- Yeah. you bet.

1263
01:24:01.034 --> 01:24:01.517
You know what?

1264
01:24:01.965 --> 01:24:04.000
You're gonna have
your money next week.

1265
01:24:04.206 --> 01:24:05.482
I'm not worried about it.

1266
01:24:06.448 --> 01:24:08.896
What the hell is
going on up there?

1267
01:24:09.103 --> 01:24:10.273
There are rats in the attic.

1268
01:24:10.275 --> 01:24:11.101
Rats?

1269
01:24:11.103 --> 01:24:11.998
Yeah. a lot of them.

1270
01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.101
You got rats up there?

1271
01:24:13.103 --> 01:24:14.344
Yeah. a whole family.

1272
01:24:14.793 --> 01:24:16.480
Why don't you do
something about it?

1273
01:24:16.482 --> 01:24:17.482
Come on.

1274
01:24:17.517 --> 01:24:19.550
I was. but I'm on a.
I'm on a new path now.

1275
01:24:21.724 --> 01:24:22.862
I don't know. man.

1276
01:24:22.896 --> 01:24:24.101
I'm having these visions.

1277
01:24:24.103 --> 01:24:25.998
and I think I might just
live with these rats.

1278
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.756
I just kinda thought
I need my ways

1279
01:24:27.758 --> 01:24:29.756
to not be so fucking
negative all the time.

1280
01:24:29.758 --> 01:24:32.204
You got damned
rats in the attic.

1281
01:24:32.206 --> 01:24:34.344
The world don't just stop.

1282
01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:36.377
And fix your problems.

1283
01:24:36.379 --> 01:24:38.379
You got to do something.

1284
01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:39.756
I guess so. but I'm telling you-

1285
01:24:39.758 --> 01:24:41.929
No. no. no. no.
You're not telling me anything.

1286
01:24:41.931 --> 01:24:46.862
Listen kid. you got to
get your mind right. okay?

1287
01:24:47.413 --> 01:24:50.585
You think I ask the
world to fix my problems?

1288
01:24:50.724 --> 01:24:53.689
When things go sour at
the gym. no way. Jose.

1289
01:24:53.724 --> 01:24:56.309
Not me. you get the wrong guy.

1290
01:24:58.550 --> 01:25:02.068
You better get up there
and fix that yourself.

1291
01:25:02.275 --> 01:25:03.585
Come on.

1292
01:25:05.344 --> 01:25:07.620
It's only for you man.
I love you. come on.

1293
01:25:07.655 --> 01:25:09.103
I want you to get right.

1294
01:25:09.448 --> 01:25:10.724
Please.

1295
01:25:11.793 --> 01:25:12.793
Shit.

1296
01:25:13.655 --> 01:25:15.620
Come on Espar. let's
get out of here.

1297
01:26:25.585 --> 01:26:27.344
Derek. it's your
neighbor. Boyle.

1298
01:26:29.862 --> 01:26:31.482
Hey man. I just want to talk.

1299
01:26:33.862 --> 01:26:35.689
Boyle. across the street.

1300
01:26:36.793 --> 01:26:38.689
The guy gassing the rats.

1301
01:27:00.137 --> 01:27:02.689
Oh. Jesus Christ.

1302
01:27:25.965 --> 01:27:27.241
Oh no.

1303
01:27:35.379 --> 01:27:36.517
Daphne!

1304
01:27:40.482 --> 01:27:41.894
I'm going to jail.

1305
01:27:41.896 --> 01:27:42.791
Like that's what's gonna happen.

1306
01:27:42.793 --> 01:27:44.448
No. no no no no. we got it.

1307
01:27:45.724 --> 01:27:47.550
I've been in this
situation before.

1308
01:27:49.275 --> 01:27:50.585
You're not going to jail.

1309
01:27:51.034 --> 01:27:52.411
We're gonna make sure
you don't go to jail.

1310
01:27:52.413 --> 01:27:53.929
We can. we'll figure it out.

1311
01:27:53.931 --> 01:27:55.585
You've been in this
situation before?

1312
01:27:57.413 --> 01:27:59.032
No. Derek and Roger Stone.

1313
01:27:59.034 --> 01:28:01.000
two fucking peas in a
fucking dick nose pod.

1314
01:28:01.517 --> 01:28:02.620
God damn it.

1315
01:28:04.379 --> 01:28:05.689
Who's Roger Stone?

1316
01:28:06.206 --> 01:28:08.827
I don't know. ever heard
of a guy named Satan?

1317
01:28:09.034 --> 01:28:10.206
He's worse than Satan.

1318
01:28:10.517 --> 01:28:11.963
He worked for Nixon.

1319
01:28:11.965 --> 01:28:14.482
and then in the 90's he
found his ultimate candidate.

1320
01:28:15.172 --> 01:28:16.862
Yeah. fricking Trump.

1321
01:28:16.896 --> 01:28:19.309
He's the one that convinced
Trump to run for office.

1322
01:28:19.965 --> 01:28:22.687
And now. now I don't
know what he's doing.

1323
01:28:22.689 --> 01:28:25.687
He's probably just like
eating cupcakes and cookies.

1324
01:28:25.689 --> 01:28:27.653
running fake social
media accounts.

1325
01:28:27.655 --> 01:28:28.827
astroturfing.

1326
01:28:29.206 --> 01:28:31.998
Derek was a wolf in
sheep's clothing.

1327
01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.517
I fricking knew something
was off with that guy.

1328
01:28:34.689 --> 01:28:36.517
I think we should
protest the hospital.

1329
01:28:36.620 --> 01:28:38.446
I think we should
go out and protest

1330
01:28:38.448 --> 01:28:39.653
the veterans associations.

1331
01:28:39.655 --> 01:28:40.895
They think they all look great.

1332
01:28:45.689 --> 01:28:46.827
I'm going to jail.

1333
01:28:48.275 --> 01:28:49.448
I know what to do.

1334
01:29:07.172 --> 01:29:07.998
This is a heist.

1335
01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.411
Of course I'm involved.

1336
01:29:09.413 --> 01:29:10.825
I've been wanting to
make a heist movie

1337
01:29:10.827 --> 01:29:12.241
since I saw "Asphalt Jungle."

1338
01:29:12.724 --> 01:29:14.825
I mean. heist movies
are the pinnacle

1339
01:29:14.827 --> 01:29:16.068
of the American experience.

1340
01:29:16.413 --> 01:29:18.170
You've got flash.
you've got bang.

1341
01:29:18.172 --> 01:29:20.550
romance. fortune.
you've got it all.

1342
01:29:21.241 --> 01:29:23.068
And this. this needs production.

1343
01:29:23.172 --> 01:29:25.068
This heist needs production.

1344
01:29:25.413 --> 01:29:26.583
That's where I come in.

1345
01:29:26.585 --> 01:29:28.825
because I produce
results. I'm a producer.

1346
01:29:28.827 --> 01:29:30.724
Want laundry? I can produce it.

1347
01:29:30.793 --> 01:29:32.756
You need a meal?
I can produce one.

1348
01:29:32.758 --> 01:29:34.958
Do you need something stolen
from your neighbor's house?

1349
01:29:35.482 --> 01:29:36.689
I can produce it.

1350
01:29:38.413 --> 01:29:39.791
We're gonna rid Derek's place

1351
01:29:39.793 --> 01:29:41.724
of anything incriminating
on all of us.

1352
01:29:42.172 --> 01:29:43.446
How much time do we have?

1353
01:29:43.448 --> 01:29:44.411
Like an hour and a half.

1354
01:29:44.413 --> 01:29:45.411
And what happens if
he gets home early?

1355
01:29:45.413 --> 01:29:46.413
What's your plan then?

1356
01:29:48.034 --> 01:29:49.034
No plan.

1357
01:29:49.068 --> 01:29:49.756
What's your plan?

1358
01:29:49.758 --> 01:29:50.758
Give us a plan.

1359
01:29:52.413 --> 01:29:53.517
We need a distraction.

1360
01:29:55.448 --> 01:29:56.894
You've never been
to Venice before.

1361
01:29:56.896 --> 01:29:58.273
You've just been mugged.

1362
01:29:58.275 --> 01:30:00.241
You don't know
where to go. okay?

1363
01:30:00.448 --> 01:30:02.000
Hi. oh my God. I'm so sorry.

1364
01:30:03.413 --> 01:30:04.411
My phone just died.

1365
01:30:04.413 --> 01:30:05.896
I'm not from here.

1366
01:30:31.379 --> 01:30:32.862
Okay. listen here.

1367
01:30:33.068 --> 01:30:34.550
Paveway Pictures
conference line.

1368
01:30:35.068 --> 01:30:35.929
If you get disconnected.

1369
01:30:35.931 --> 01:30:37.344
I've texted you
the number and pin.

1370
01:30:37.550 --> 01:30:39.206
Okay. now here's the plan.

1371
01:30:39.379 --> 01:30:40.618
According to Daphne.

1372
01:30:40.620 --> 01:30:42.300
he'll be leaving at
approximately four p.m.

1373
01:30:48.103 --> 01:30:50.068
I'll be stationed
close. watching.

1374
01:30:50.241 --> 01:30:51.379
But once we know he's gone.

1375
01:30:52.862 --> 01:30:54.137
clock is up.

1376
01:30:54.689 --> 01:30:55.687
Anna. are we clear?

1377
01:30:55.689 --> 01:30:56.827
All clear.

1378
01:30:57.689 --> 01:30:58.896
We go.

1379
01:31:03.482 --> 01:31:05.275
Daphne will break
into Derek's house.

1380
01:31:10.413 --> 01:31:11.583
All right. luck on our side.

1381
01:31:11.585 --> 01:31:12.758
We've got a solid hour-15.

1382
01:31:12.793 --> 01:31:13.482
Copy.

1383
01:31:13.655 --> 01:31:14.998
Boyle. you get
the car ready to go.

1384
01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:15.998
and begin the gassing.

1385
01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.275
That's the key time sync.

1386
01:31:26.137 --> 01:31:27.413
Update. all clear.

1387
01:31:38.655 --> 01:31:39.515
This is kind of fun.

1388
01:31:39.517 --> 01:31:40.480
What the fuck are you doing?

1389
01:31:40.482 --> 01:31:41.722
- Huh?
- What the fuck are you doing?

1390
01:31:41.724 --> 01:31:42.724
Get in position.

1391
01:31:42.862 --> 01:31:44.422
You're supposed to
be doing the gassing.

1392
01:31:51.758 --> 01:31:52.931
I'm in.

1393
01:31:53.034 --> 01:31:54.480
With the gas going.
your priority would be

1394
01:31:54.482 --> 01:31:56.550
to assist Daphne
inside the house.

1395
01:32:02.758 --> 01:32:04.827
Daphne. tell Boyle to
put his headphones on.

1396
01:32:06.517 --> 01:32:08.204
Daphne will hack
Derek's computer.

1397
01:32:08.206 --> 01:32:09.689
and proceed to scrub it clean.

1398
01:32:18.034 --> 01:32:19.034
I'm in.

1399
01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:21.722
Yeah. we can hear you.

1400
01:32:21.724 --> 01:32:23.517
Put your headphones
in. Ted's freaking out.

1401
01:32:31.862 --> 01:32:34.032
Voluntary institutions
of civil society

1402
01:32:34.034 --> 01:32:35.515
that provided social services.

1403
01:32:35.517 --> 01:32:36.724
medical care and education

1404
01:32:36.793 --> 01:32:39.010
were deliberately targeted for
destruction. in some cases.

1405
01:32:39.034 --> 01:32:40.342
Were normal words
coming out of my mouth?

1406
01:32:40.344 --> 01:32:41.655
I just hear gibberish.

1407
01:32:42.137 --> 01:32:43.137
Just please.

1408
01:32:43.172 --> 01:32:44.687
Can you put that down.
and stick to the plan?

1409
01:32:44.689 --> 01:32:45.722
What's the plan?

1410
01:32:45.724 --> 01:32:46.894
Just get rid of that.

1411
01:32:46.896 --> 01:32:48.548
Boyle will get
rid of all the photos

1412
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:50.344
and all the physical
evidence lying around.

1413
01:32:56.862 --> 01:32:58.687
Once you're both done
with those tasks.

1414
01:32:58.689 --> 01:33:00.068
we move on to phase two.

1415
01:33:00.965 --> 01:33:02.307
Boyle. you finish cleaning up.

1416
01:33:02.309 --> 01:33:04.549
and you run back across the
street to finish the gassing.

1417
01:33:04.931 --> 01:33:06.758
Daphne. you hurry
up and get out.

1418
01:33:10.896 --> 01:33:12.791
Anna will wait on standby.

1419
01:33:12.793 --> 01:33:15.033
and you give the first heads
up. or run any interference.

1420
01:33:15.241 --> 01:33:16.724
Anna. we clear?

1421
01:33:18.931 --> 01:33:20.206
We're clear.

1422
01:33:20.758 --> 01:33:21.758
Copy.

1423
01:33:26.862 --> 01:33:28.377
Gassing looks good. no leakage.

1424
01:33:28.379 --> 01:33:29.585
definitely still going.

1425
01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:31.034
He's on time.

1426
01:33:32.103 --> 01:33:35.101
10-4. roger that. copy
you. copy you. copy you.

1427
01:33:35.103 --> 01:33:36.275
One. two. three.

1428
01:33:36.344 --> 01:33:38.625
Change of plans. I'm gonna
have to destroy the hard drive.

1429
01:33:40.034 --> 01:33:42.929
No time. no time
and unnecessary.

1430
01:33:42.931 --> 01:33:44.379
That's not part of the plan.

1431
01:33:44.585 --> 01:33:46.101
Okay well yeah.
that's what I'm doing.

1432
01:33:46.103 --> 01:33:49.344
So. and you need
to just fuck off.

1433
01:33:58.241 --> 01:33:59.342
Can you hear that?

1434
01:33:59.344 --> 01:34:00.482
Hear what?

1435
01:34:01.655 --> 01:34:02.446
Where'd you go?

1436
01:34:02.448 --> 01:34:03.793
Where are you going?

1437
01:34:03.827 --> 01:34:05.068
Boyle. status?

1438
01:34:10.448 --> 01:34:13.342
Guys. I need to find this.
there's. I'm having a feeling.

1439
01:34:13.344 --> 01:34:14.204
What? No. no. no. no. no.

1440
01:34:14.206 --> 01:34:15.342
What are you doing?

1441
01:34:15.344 --> 01:34:17.517
No. you need to get your
ass back over to the car.

1442
01:34:17.689 --> 01:34:19.309
The gassing should
be almost done.

1443
01:34:29.172 --> 01:34:30.172
He's coming.

1444
01:34:30.309 --> 01:34:31.585
I think it's him.

1445
01:34:31.827 --> 01:34:32.827
It's him. it's him.

1446
01:34:33.517 --> 01:34:34.756
He's wearing a green helmet.

1447
01:34:34.758 --> 01:34:35.827
Distract him.

1448
01:34:35.965 --> 01:34:37.620
Anna. you're a
fucking star today.

1449
01:34:43.413 --> 01:34:44.965
Boyle. Daphne.

1450
01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:46.860
Guys. I'm back.

1451
01:34:46.862 --> 01:34:48.862
The hard drive has been
successfully destroyed.

1452
01:34:49.034 --> 01:34:50.954
I have no idea where Boyle
is or what he's doing.

1453
01:34:56.793 --> 01:34:58.101
If you can hear me. wrap it up.

1454
01:34:58.103 --> 01:34:59.103
Let's go.

1455
01:35:00.896 --> 01:35:02.827
I'm sorry. my phone's dead too.

1456
01:35:02.931 --> 01:35:04.309
Putting up the prize.

1457
01:35:13.689 --> 01:35:15.170
Maybe I could get your number.

1458
01:35:15.172 --> 01:35:16.860
and we could talk
at a later date?

1459
01:35:16.862 --> 01:35:18.239
My phone's dead.

1460
01:35:18.241 --> 01:35:19.239
I don't know. How would I
get your number?

1461
01:35:19.241 --> 01:35:20.448
That makes no sense.

1462
01:35:20.517 --> 01:35:22.411
You can tell me. I actually
have a photographic memory.

1463
01:35:22.413 --> 01:35:23.515
Boyle?

1464
01:35:23.517 --> 01:35:24.239
I'm coming.

1465
01:35:24.241 --> 01:35:25.550
Okay. hurry up.

1466
01:35:25.827 --> 01:35:27.032
I'm leaving now.

1467
01:35:27.034 --> 01:35:28.034
Okay.

1468
01:35:37.241 --> 01:35:39.758
And then you take a left.
and you go about a mile.

1469
01:35:39.793 --> 01:35:41.424
and you'll see the
ocean. the Pacific Ocean.

1470
01:35:41.448 --> 01:35:42.550
Is it an obvious left.

1471
01:35:42.724 --> 01:35:44.377
or one of those lefts that's
kind of like sneaky. you know?

1472
01:35:44.379 --> 01:35:45.411
A sneaky left?

1473
01:35:45.413 --> 01:35:46.963
Yeah. like somehow
the roads are curved.

1474
01:35:46.965 --> 01:35:49.515
What's sneaky. I don't know
what it means. a sneaky left.

1475
01:35:49.517 --> 01:35:50.860
All right guys. I'm exiting.

1476
01:35:50.862 --> 01:35:51.894
I gotta go now.

1477
01:35:51.896 --> 01:35:53.034
I gotta go.

1478
01:36:09.344 --> 01:36:10.448
Cutting the gas.

1479
01:36:16.068 --> 01:36:17.583
Really. this is just too much.

1480
01:36:17.585 --> 01:36:20.791
Please. please. please.
I just need more exact direction.

1481
01:36:20.793 --> 01:36:22.827
Oh watch out for
the pool cleaners.

1482
01:36:33.137 --> 01:36:34.275
Here boy. it's me.

1483
01:36:34.793 --> 01:36:37.379
It's me. it's me
Zappo. come here.

1484
01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.000
I know.

1485
01:37:05.309 --> 01:37:07.480
You gotta get out.
you have maybe 10 seconds.

1486
01:37:07.482 --> 01:37:09.162
Boyle. he's coming up
the stairs right now.

1487
01:38:31.758 --> 01:38:33.241
You're not groovy. man.

1488
01:38:35.931 --> 01:38:37.241
Perhaps I'm not.

1489
01:39:20.724 --> 01:39:22.653
Ah. things seem right again

1490
01:39:22.655 --> 01:39:24.482
at the old Boyle house.

1491
01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.413
I'll walk you out. man.

1492
01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:56.929
So what. you're leaving?

1493
01:39:56.931 --> 01:39:58.620
I'm going back to the bulk.

1494
01:39:59.000 --> 01:39:59.791
Can I come?

1495
01:39:59.793 --> 01:40:00.860
I'm afraid you cannot.

1496
01:40:00.862 --> 01:40:01.618
Is it groovy?

1497
01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:02.793
It is.

1498
01:40:03.827 --> 01:40:04.827
All right.

1499
01:40:04.931 --> 01:40:06.653
I have one
more thing to say to you.

1500
01:40:06.655 --> 01:40:07.653
What's that?

1501
01:40:07.655 --> 01:40:08.653
Thank you.

1502
01:40:08.655 --> 01:40:10.827
Oh no. thank you. man.

1503
01:40:11.309 --> 01:40:12.689
I'm gonna miss you.

1504
01:40:12.862 --> 01:40:14.482
I'll miss you too. Boyle.

1505
01:40:14.862 --> 01:40:15.756
Yeah yeah yeah.

1506
01:40:15.758 --> 01:40:16.931
Groovy.

1507
01:40:23.724 --> 01:40:26.827
Boyle indeed. is
the man who knows.

1508
01:40:29.309 --> 01:40:33.309
Perhaps I was skeptical at
first. but he does know.

1509
01:40:33.862 --> 01:40:35.448
He knows Mondo.

1510
01:40:35.793 --> 01:40:40.000
The language. the
true cosmic language.

1511
01:40:40.344 --> 01:40:42.137
A little piece of this Earth.

1512
01:40:42.655 --> 01:40:44.758
A space bound to time.

1513
01:40:53.137 --> 01:40:55.860
Even if this land of Hollywood

1514
01:40:55.862 --> 01:40:59.066
were to vanish into
oblivion in an instant.

1515
01:40:59.068 --> 01:41:04.724
and this happened tomorrow.
it's legacy would never leave.

1516
01:41:08.413 --> 01:41:11.137
Forever. there
will be The Titan.

1517
01:41:14.172 --> 01:41:15.862
The Weirdo.

1518
01:41:19.550 --> 01:41:20.724
The Dreamer.

1519
01:41:23.758 --> 01:41:27.379
and so forever there
will be Hollywood.

1520
01:41:27.585 --> 01:41:30.000
Forever groovy. forever.

1521
01:41:31.862 --> 01:41:33.379
Mondo.
