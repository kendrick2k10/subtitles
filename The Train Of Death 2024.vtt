00:00:12.125 --> 00:00:16.166
Continue on that one. It has been marked.

4
00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:26.333
Watch out!

5
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:45.166
- Let's go.
- Yes. bring that one.

6
00:00:58.375 --> 00:00:59.375
Call it off.

7
00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:01.750
or they will be furious

8
00:01:03.291 --> 00:01:06.208
and the punishment
will be far more painful than death.

9
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.583
- I beg you. sir.
- Come with me.

10
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
No one will be able to help you.

11
00:01:18.458 --> 00:01:19.916
Not your money.

12
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:22.833
not even God.

13
00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.250
Let's call it a night.

14
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:43.291
- Let's go home.
- Come on.

15
00:02:07.375 --> 00:02:08.375
Darto!

16
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.250
What is it?

17
00:02:12.333 --> 00:02:13.541
Let's go back.

18
00:02:14.375 --> 00:02:16.083
Let's continue the work tomorrow.

19
00:02:23.708 --> 00:02:29.166
If we stop working now.
we'll have our wages deducted tomorrow.

20
00:02:34.208 --> 00:02:37.166
I can't face my wife
if I send her less money.

21
00:02:38.375 --> 00:02:40.375
and I still have installments to make.

22
00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:44.875
You too. right?

23
00:02:47.458 --> 00:02:49.833
- All right then.
- Good.

24
00:03:22.708 --> 00:03:25.083
Paiman!

25
00:03:31.791 --> 00:03:32.791
Paiman?

26
00:03:35.791 --> 00:03:37.000
Paiman?

27
00:03:50.791 --> 00:03:51.791
Paiman?

28
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.333
Paiman.

29
00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:01.208
Paiman?

30
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.333
DEMONS AND ITS REALM

31
00:05:22.083 --> 00:05:27.708
Mr. Bara. I will surely develop
your region to be much better.

32
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.500
especially in terms of tourism.

33
00:05:31.583 --> 00:05:36.041
as long as you can continue
to coordinate with me.

34
00:05:36.125 --> 00:05:38.041
- You get it. right?
- Yes. sir.

35
00:05:38.125 --> 00:05:40.708
But we can discuss it later.

36
00:05:40.791 --> 00:05:43.416
- Right.
- Now. let's just enjoy the moment.

37
00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:02.458
CONGRATULATIONS FOR THE OPENING
OF SANGKARA RESORT

38
00:06:11.416 --> 00:06:13.208
Why are we looking at this?

39
00:06:14.333 --> 00:06:16.333
So I've made a list.

40
00:06:17.875 --> 00:06:19.083
No!

41
00:06:21.375 --> 00:06:25.000
I've made a list of our activities there.

42
00:06:25.541 --> 00:06:29.291
We can learn our travel route
based on this mockup

43
00:06:29.375 --> 00:06:31.375
so that we don't get lost on the way.

44
00:06:32.166 --> 00:06:36.000
By the way. according to this brochure.

45
00:06:36.083 --> 00:06:41.291
we will be passing through
five railroad tunnels they just built.

46
00:06:41.375 --> 00:06:44.416
What? Railroad tunnels?

47
00:06:44.916 --> 00:06:47.833
Here. after dinner.

48
00:06:47.916 --> 00:06:52.708
we will take a relaxing soak
in the hot spring pool

49
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:54.916
while watching the fireworks.

50
00:07:00.708 --> 00:07:01.625
Taking a soak?

51
00:07:02.583 --> 00:07:04.041
No.

52
00:07:04.125 --> 00:07:06.375
You've just recovered from your illness.

53
00:07:07.375 --> 00:07:11.000
- If you do it. you'll get sick again.
- It's pointless for me

54
00:07:11.083 --> 00:07:13.958
to celebrate my recovery
if I am not allowed to do anything.

55
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.083
Then I'll go back to Jakarta.

56
00:07:18.541 --> 00:07:19.791
Right now.

57
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.708
All right. I won't. you fussy brat.

58
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.875
Good.

59
00:07:30.041 --> 00:07:32.583
I think our room is right here.
Don't you think so?

60
00:07:32.666 --> 00:07:36.041
I would've liked to take the room here.
but I couldn't afford it.

61
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.083
Give me back my husband!

62
00:07:45.166 --> 00:07:50.375
- Give me back my husband!
- Where is my husband?

63
00:07:50.458 --> 00:07:52.916
- Give me back my husband!
- Give me back my husband!

64
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.875
- Give me back my husband!
- Relax.

65
00:07:56.958 --> 00:08:01.166
- Where is my husband?
- Where is my husband?

66
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:04.625
- Give me back my husband!

67
00:08:04.708 --> 00:08:06.916

68
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.458
- Give me back my husband!
- Give me back my husband!

69
00:08:09.541 --> 00:08:11.458
What's going on here?

70
00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:15.000
It's nothing. sir.
Every change has its pros and cons.

71
00:08:15.083 --> 00:08:18.083
but everything is under control.

72
00:08:18.166 --> 00:08:22.166
I need you
to take care of this thoroughly.

73
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.208
- Do you understand?
- Yes. sir.

74
00:08:24.291 --> 00:08:26.000
Give me back my husband!

75
00:08:26.083 --> 00:08:29.041
Where is my husband?

76
00:08:31.083 --> 00:08:33.916
Please sit back and relax. sir.

77
00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:50.166
- Could you please take a picture of us?
- Sure.

78
00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:52.666
- Press this button. okay?
- What are you doing?

79
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:55.750
- Let's take a photo. Come on.
- No way!

80
00:08:55.833 --> 00:08:57.000
Let's do this pose.

81
00:08:57.583 --> 00:09:00.083
- One. two. three.
- No.

82
00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:03.541
- Thank you.
- No problem.

83
00:09:03.625 --> 00:09:05.333
Hold this camera for a second.

84
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.458
Do you know where this is?

85
00:09:08.583 --> 00:09:11.666
It's in Economy Class Two.
car number five. at the very back.

86
00:09:12.583 --> 00:09:14.541
Thank you. Tekun.

87
00:09:15.916 --> 00:09:17.416
You're welcome.

88
00:09:19.583 --> 00:09:20.791
Take it back with you.

89
00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:25.916
Solo guys are sweet. aren't they?

90
00:09:27.166 --> 00:09:29.375
And you think Dr. Nugroho is cute.

91
00:09:30.041 --> 00:09:31.416
You're such a flirtatious girl!

92
00:09:40.916 --> 00:09:42.708
Our seat's number is…

93
00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:45.041
- 7A.
- It's right there.

94
00:09:51.916 --> 00:09:53.666
All right. Let me help you with this.

95
00:09:55.333 --> 00:09:57.833
I feel sleepy. Mom.

96
00:09:57.916 --> 00:10:02.416
Go to sleep then.
We'll get there by the time you wake up.

97
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.541
Welcome to Sangkara Train.

98
00:10:16.625 --> 00:10:20.541
<i>A special tourism train
with a route to Sangkara Resort.</i>

99
00:10:21.125 --> 00:10:24.750
<i>The Sangkara Train journey
will take seven hours.</i>

100
00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:28.833
<i>We are expected
to arrive at Sangkara Resort at 7:00 p.m.</i>

101
00:10:28.916 --> 00:10:30.416
- Here you go. sir.
- Thank you. Indah.

102
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:36.708
<i>I'm Sidik. the conductor on duty.
wishing you a memorable journey</i>

103
00:10:36.791 --> 00:10:39.958
<i>with Sangkara Train.</i>

104
00:10:46.583 --> 00:10:49.333
Tourism in this area
will definitely grow rapidly

105
00:10:49.416 --> 00:10:52.083
if led by a good regent like you.

106
00:10:52.916 --> 00:10:55.125
- I agree.
- Thank you.

107
00:10:55.208 --> 00:10:57.833
Thanks to Mr. Santoso.
all of this has been made possible.

108
00:10:58.416 --> 00:11:04.125
If not for him.
this area will always be forgotten.

109
00:11:04.875 --> 00:11:06.041
All right then.

110
00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:10.625
Let's make a toast
to Sangkara and our future projects.

111
00:11:15.833 --> 00:11:17.166
Adam.

112
00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:20.541
- Let's take a picture.
- I'll take this position. okay?

113
00:11:23.041 --> 00:11:24.583
One. two…

114
00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:31.083
<i>- Wipe your tears away
- Wipe your tears away</i>

115
00:11:31.166 --> 00:11:34.750
<i>- I will always cheer you up

116

117
00:11:37.416 --> 00:11:40.125
- Your tears!
- Your tears!

118
00:11:40.208 --> 00:11:42.708
- Your tears!
- Wait.

119
00:11:44.875 --> 00:11:46.375
Let's take a picture!

120
00:11:46.458 --> 00:11:48.875
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

121
00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.833
- Let's take another picture!
- Come on.

122
00:11:52.666 --> 00:11:54.708
Let me help you with that.

123
00:11:55.916 --> 00:11:59.250
- Don't do that.
- You're so noisy.

124
00:11:59.875 --> 00:12:01.208
Thank you.

125
00:12:09.333 --> 00:12:10.958
- Look at this.
- What is it?

126
00:12:11.041 --> 00:12:12.291
Let me help you.

127
00:12:14.208 --> 00:12:15.333
Be careful.

128
00:12:16.416 --> 00:12:18.416
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

129
00:12:25.416 --> 00:12:27.041
He's coming this way.

130
00:12:42.416 --> 00:12:44.333
Ouch. it hurts.

131
00:12:54.083 --> 00:12:56.625
Come on. don't flatter yourself.

132
00:12:57.208 --> 00:13:02.166
Attention to all crew members.
the Sangkara Train is about to depart.

133
00:13:45.583 --> 00:13:49.000
Guys. let's make an Instagram story.
Come here.

134
00:13:56.291 --> 00:13:59.875
So now we're on the train to…

135
00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:03.333
- Sangkara Resort!
- Sangkara Resort!

136
00:14:03.416 --> 00:14:06.875
The scenery along the way is picturesque

137
00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:10.541
and the train is awesome.
You should definitely try it.

138
00:14:10.625 --> 00:14:15.166
But you have to try it in the VIP.
not the economy class.

139
00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:18.291
Because there are many commoners
in that class.

140
00:14:22.916 --> 00:14:25.333
Many online affiliates have been arrested.

141
00:14:26.208 --> 00:14:28.125
Soon. it will be my turn…

142
00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.041
to be named as a suspect.

143
00:14:33.166 --> 00:14:36.916
So that's why all of a sudden
you asked me to go to Solo.

144
00:14:38.791 --> 00:14:41.333
Are we running away right now?

145
00:14:42.791 --> 00:14:44.625
Why don't we go to another country?

146
00:14:44.708 --> 00:14:46.833
All of my assets have been confiscated.

147
00:14:56.666 --> 00:14:59.125
This is the only asset I can secure.

148
00:15:03.833 --> 00:15:05.791
You are such a loser.

149
00:15:08.875 --> 00:15:10.250
Excuse me.

150
00:15:11.083 --> 00:15:13.333
Would you like to order
some food or drinks?

151
00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.125
No. thank you.

152
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.083
Sorry. sir. Can I help you
put the bag in the overhead bin?

153
00:15:24.041 --> 00:15:25.333
For safety reasons.

154
00:15:25.416 --> 00:15:28.125
it is prohibited for passengers
to place luggage on the seats.

155
00:16:21.083 --> 00:16:24.125
- Come on!
- Your singing is terrible!

156
00:16:24.208 --> 00:16:26.916
- Let me play it.
- Give it back!

157
00:17:09.333 --> 00:17:11.333
- Miss.
- Yes?

158
00:17:11.416 --> 00:17:16.208
I saw a man there a moment ago.
Where is he now?

159
00:17:16.833 --> 00:17:19.083
There's only that guy. ma'am.

160
00:17:19.166 --> 00:17:22.125
No. the man was wearing
a worker's uniform.

161
00:17:24.625 --> 00:17:26.708
And his face was…

162
00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.208
There was no one as such. ma'am.

163
00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:35.458
Do you want to get something?

164
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.000
Sorry. economy class passengers
are only allowed up to this point.

165
00:18:07.083 --> 00:18:08.375
I need to go there.

166
00:18:08.458 --> 00:18:10.541
No. you can't go over there.

167
00:18:10.625 --> 00:18:13.916
- I want to talk to them.
- Sorry. you can't.

168
00:18:15.375 --> 00:18:17.208
Can I get you anything?

169
00:18:21.875 --> 00:18:23.666
Just get me a cup of coffee.

170
00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:26.250
Please. ma'am. It's a self-service.

171
00:18:26.333 --> 00:18:28.416
- What?
- It's self-service. ma'am.

172
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:34.083
There's something
I need to talk to you about.

173
00:18:35.791 --> 00:18:37.958
It's about the incident at the station.

174
00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:40.250
I see.

175
00:18:42.083 --> 00:18:43.833
Kindly bear with it. sir.

176
00:18:43.916 --> 00:18:48.583
Local people are easily triggered
by rumors.

177
00:18:48.666 --> 00:18:52.125
They can use any issue
to stage a demonstration.

178
00:18:52.208 --> 00:18:55.875
So they were protesting
against the station office

179
00:18:55.958 --> 00:19:00.041
for firing some employees.

180
00:19:00.125 --> 00:19:02.625
I don't want to know about it. Mr. Bara.

181
00:19:03.416 --> 00:19:05.250
The incident at the station

182
00:19:05.333 --> 00:19:08.333
embarrassed me in front of the investors.

183
00:19:10.333 --> 00:19:14.583
Such disturbances can ruin
the image of our tourism.

184
00:19:23.083 --> 00:19:24.666
Look at that. Mom!

185
00:19:29.875 --> 00:19:33.208
Here you go again with your journal.

186
00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:37.833
I just want to see it.

187
00:19:38.375 --> 00:19:41.875
You'll see it eventually. but not now.

188
00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:43.125
Tomorrow?

189
00:19:44.291 --> 00:19:45.791
One day.

190
00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.166
Tomorrow. at the resort.
you have to tell me

191
00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:51.083
what's in your journal.

192
00:19:56.291 --> 00:19:58.958
Stop being so mysterious.
it pisses me off.

193
00:20:13.291 --> 00:20:15.791
- Purnama.
- What is it?

194
00:20:16.583 --> 00:20:17.875
There was…

195
00:20:18.583 --> 00:20:20.791
I thought I saw a bird.

196
00:20:24.666 --> 00:20:25.791
Kembang.

197
00:20:25.875 --> 00:20:26.958
I need to go to the toilet.

198
00:20:27.541 --> 00:20:29.000
- Do you want me to go with you?
- No.

199
00:20:29.083 --> 00:20:30.708
- You stay here.
- Let me go with you.

200
00:20:30.791 --> 00:20:32.541
I just need to pee. I'll be right back.

201
00:20:40.125 --> 00:20:41.125
That's weird.

202
00:20:42.541 --> 00:20:43.958
What's taking so long?

203
00:21:04.625 --> 00:21:06.000
{\an8}"…we've reached our destination."

204
00:21:06.083 --> 00:21:07.958
{\an8}DO YOU REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME
WE RIDE A TRAIN…

205
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:18.916
{\an8}I USED TO DISLIKE IT WHEN
MOM ASKED ME TO SPOONFEED YOU

206
00:23:13.791 --> 00:23:14.791
Don.

207
00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:17.791
what's wrong with that door?

208
00:23:23.583 --> 00:23:25.333
Go there and check it out.

209
00:23:26.375 --> 00:23:28.000
- Go on.
- Yes. sir.

210
00:24:00.875 --> 00:24:04.708
<i>The number you're calling is not available
or out of coverage area.</i>

211
00:24:04.791 --> 00:24:05.875
<i>Try again--</i>

212
00:24:07.791 --> 00:24:11.958
<i>The number you're calling is not available
or out of coverage area.</i>

213
00:24:25.791 --> 00:24:27.625
What's wrong with the lights?

214
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:33.750
Purnama?

215
00:25:58.916 --> 00:25:59.916
Purnama?

216
00:26:01.208 --> 00:26:02.208
Purnama?

217
00:26:03.958 --> 00:26:05.375
Why are you here?

218
00:26:05.916 --> 00:26:08.083
I was worried about you.

219
00:26:08.666 --> 00:26:10.333
What took you so long anyway?

220
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.291
You threw up. didn't you?

221
00:26:17.208 --> 00:26:19.500
- I just got a little motion sickness.
- No. you didn't.

222
00:26:22.416 --> 00:26:23.416
See?

223
00:26:24.583 --> 00:26:27.708
Once we get there.
we've got to see a doctor. okay?

224
00:26:29.875 --> 00:26:32.708
- What a fussy girl.
- Let me clean this up first.

225
00:26:47.083 --> 00:26:48.500
- Kembang.
- Yes?

226
00:26:56.125 --> 00:26:57.125
Purnama…

227
00:26:57.791 --> 00:27:00.166
- Purnama?
- Come on!

228
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.250
- How is it? Everything's under control?
- Of course.

229
00:27:12.333 --> 00:27:14.833
For you. of course. sir.

230
00:27:16.333 --> 00:27:19.458
- Excuse me. I'll be right back.
- Sure.

231
00:27:25.708 --> 00:27:27.208
Can I help you?

232
00:27:27.791 --> 00:27:29.541
The fifth car is missing.

233
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:31.916
What do you mean by "missing"?

234
00:28:04.333 --> 00:28:05.666
Sir.

235
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:06.791
I need to use the toilet.

236
00:28:06.875 --> 00:28:11.000
Sorry. this toilet is out of order.
Please use the one in front of the cabin.

237
00:28:11.083 --> 00:28:12.291
Let me take you there.

238
00:28:13.958 --> 00:28:15.666
This way. sir.

239
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:18.583
Where is the fifth car?
Why isn't it there?

240
00:28:18.666 --> 00:28:20.458
{\an8}- Missing?
- The fifth car is missing.

241
00:28:21.416 --> 00:28:24.041
- What is it?
- The fifth car is missing.

242
00:28:24.125 --> 00:28:25.916
- How come. sir?
- How come. sir?

243
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.250
Please calm down. everyone.
There was just a small technical glitch.

244
00:28:30.333 --> 00:28:33.625
Everything has been taken care of.
It was left in the tunnel a moment ago.

245
00:28:33.708 --> 00:28:35.791
We apologize for the inconvenience.

246
00:28:35.875 --> 00:28:38.500
The fifth car
will soon follow us to the resort.

247
00:28:39.083 --> 00:28:40.708
Now. if you'll excuse me.

248
00:28:40.791 --> 00:28:42.541
- Let's sit down again.
- That's nice.

249
00:28:42.625 --> 00:28:46.333
We can rest easy now. everything is fine.

250
00:28:46.416 --> 00:28:49.083
- Sir. hold on a second.
- Yes?

251
00:28:52.708 --> 00:28:54.000
Can I help you?

252
00:28:54.083 --> 00:28:58.625
You said the fifth car was safe
and would be picked up.

253
00:28:58.708 --> 00:29:00.083
You lied. didn't you?

254
00:29:00.666 --> 00:29:03.166
As I explained earlier.

255
00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:06.458
the fifth car was not missing
but was left in the tunnel.

256
00:29:06.541 --> 00:29:08.916
And everything is under control now.

257
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.166
Why did this happen?

258
00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:15.250
Were there no railroad tests
or safety checks performed prior to this?

259
00:29:15.333 --> 00:29:20.833
If the testing hadn't been done.
I wouldn't want to be here either.

260
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.916
You just sit tight.
and we'll be safe on this journey. okay?

261
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.375
If you'll excuse me.

262
00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.125
Please wait a moment. okay?

263
00:29:36.916 --> 00:29:38.375
What the hell was that?

264
00:29:42.375 --> 00:29:44.750
- I need to use the toilet.
- I'll go with you.

265
00:29:46.416 --> 00:29:49.083
You'd better get me a drink. okay?

266
00:29:50.208 --> 00:29:52.750
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

267
00:30:23.625 --> 00:30:24.500
Hello?

268
00:30:24.583 --> 00:30:27.458
<i>Hello. Kembang. This is Dr. Nugroho.</i>

269
00:30:28.166 --> 00:30:29.791
How are you. doctor?

270
00:30:31.541 --> 00:30:33.541
But why did you call me?

271
00:30:33.625 --> 00:30:37.666
<i>Because Purnama hasn't picked up
my calls since last week.</i>

272
00:30:38.166 --> 00:30:41.166
<i>I contacted your father
as the patient's guardian.</i>

273
00:30:41.958 --> 00:30:44.708
<i>and he gave me your number.</i>

274
00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.208
What is it. doctor?

275
00:30:49.291 --> 00:30:53.833
<i>Purnama must have
a health check immediately. or else…</i>

276
00:30:54.833 --> 00:30:57.250
Another health check?

277
00:30:57.791 --> 00:31:01.625
She said that you'd confirmed
that she was cured.

278
00:31:01.708 --> 00:31:03.166
<i>Didn't she tell you</i>

279
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.250
<i>that her liver cancer surgery
was unsuccessful?</i>

280
00:31:09.375 --> 00:31:11.541
<i>The cancer cells have spread throughout--</i>

281
00:31:13.708 --> 00:31:15.708
Hello? Doctor?

282
00:31:16.583 --> 00:31:18.666
Hello? Doctor?

283
00:31:45.875 --> 00:31:47.041
Thank you.

284
00:31:50.375 --> 00:31:52.375
Dr. Nugroho just called me.

285
00:31:55.791 --> 00:31:57.291
He told me everything.

286
00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.416
Why didn't you tell me?

287
00:32:13.083 --> 00:32:14.833
I'm the one who keeps you company.

288
00:32:17.333 --> 00:32:19.583
Who was the one always there for you?

289
00:32:21.625 --> 00:32:22.708
Me!

290
00:32:24.083 --> 00:32:26.958
But you still dare lie to me?

291
00:32:28.916 --> 00:32:31.250
I just wanted to spend my time with you.

292
00:32:32.333 --> 00:32:36.291
If I told you. you wouldn't want to go.
and we wouldn't be here right now.

293
00:32:36.375 --> 00:32:38.375
"Spending your time"?

294
00:32:40.416 --> 00:32:44.916
We can spend our time in the hospital!

295
00:32:49.166 --> 00:32:50.458
Do you want me

296
00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:56.166
to spend the rest of my time
in the hospital?

297
00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:58.541
Don't be such a smart ass about dying!

298
00:33:02.875 --> 00:33:05.916
You don't know what it's like
to be unable to do anything there.

299
00:33:07.708 --> 00:33:11.875
I'm tired of taking so many medicines
each and every day.

300
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000
You don't know what it's like.

301
00:33:15.583 --> 00:33:20.333
I'd rather be here with you
while enjoying the lovely scenery

302
00:33:20.416 --> 00:33:23.208
than in a hospital
where I can only see the walls.

303
00:33:23.291 --> 00:33:25.083
You really don't know what it's like.

304
00:33:29.583 --> 00:33:30.750
Do you know why?

305
00:33:31.833 --> 00:33:33.916
I don't have much time left!

306
00:33:40.708 --> 00:33:42.708
I'm going to die soon.

307
00:33:45.291 --> 00:33:47.833
- I don't have much time left!
- Purnama.

308
00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:50.583
Purnama.

309
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:55.083
There are so many treatments
we haven't tried yet.

310
00:33:56.166 --> 00:33:59.708
If you leave me.

311
00:33:59.791 --> 00:34:03.125
will I have to live with Dad.
who doesn't care about us?

312
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.458
You're all I have

313
00:34:10.541 --> 00:34:13.541
and I don't want you
to leave me like that.

314
00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.958
- No.
- I saw your journal.

315
00:34:22.625 --> 00:34:24.166
It's for me. right?

316
00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:34.458
- Just in case I can't say goodbye.
- Purnama.

317
00:34:35.833 --> 00:34:38.125
No. Purnama.

318
00:34:38.708 --> 00:34:40.708
Look at me!

319
00:34:40.791 --> 00:34:44.208
You must continue your treatment
until you're cured!

320
00:34:44.833 --> 00:34:49.875
You have to stay with me
because I want to see your hair turn gray!

321
00:34:50.666 --> 00:34:52.041
Purnama.

322
00:34:52.916 --> 00:34:55.375
I don't want you to leave me!

323
00:34:56.041 --> 00:34:58.416
Look at me.

324
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.666
I just don't want you to leave me!

325
00:35:04.333 --> 00:35:06.416
Just don't leave me.

326
00:36:12.375 --> 00:36:13.541
Tekun!

327
00:36:14.125 --> 00:36:18.125
Sir! I just saw people
covered in blood here. sir!

328
00:36:18.208 --> 00:36:21.416
- People were covered in blood here!
- Hey! What's wrong with you?

329
00:36:22.416 --> 00:36:24.333
The driver's radio is short-circuited.

330
00:36:24.916 --> 00:36:27.666
We can't contact the control center.

331
00:36:30.375 --> 00:36:34.458
And what happened to the electrical panel?

332
00:36:35.708 --> 00:36:39.708
I came here to contact
the emergency services. sir.

333
00:36:39.791 --> 00:36:43.791
- But everything is malfunctioning and…
- Emergency?

334
00:36:45.458 --> 00:36:50.000
The fifth car was detached
from this train and went missing. sir.

335
00:36:53.583 --> 00:36:56.666
That's impossible. Tekun.

336
00:36:58.291 --> 00:37:03.208
It takes a special procedure
to separate the cars.

337
00:37:03.291 --> 00:37:07.750
Sir. the fifth car is missing.

338
00:37:08.458 --> 00:37:10.458
It's gone.

339
00:37:19.083 --> 00:37:21.083
If that is true.

340
00:37:22.666 --> 00:37:28.875
Mr. Santoso should not know about this
until we can figure out the cause.

341
00:37:30.291 --> 00:37:31.291
Now look.

342
00:37:32.125 --> 00:37:35.125
you handle the economy passengers
of the fourth car

343
00:37:35.208 --> 00:37:37.208
in a procedural manner.

344
00:37:37.291 --> 00:37:39.541
- Do you get it?
- Yes. sir.

345
00:37:40.541 --> 00:37:41.791
Hold on a second.

346
00:37:43.125 --> 00:37:44.291
Look at me.

347
00:37:45.666 --> 00:37:48.833
We're in this together. okay?

348
00:38:10.041 --> 00:38:11.541
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

349
00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:16.416
Why is the reception so bad here?

350
00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:17.875
Here you go. sir.

351
00:38:18.708 --> 00:38:20.625
What's wrong with the reception?

352
00:38:20.708 --> 00:38:22.833
- See.
- Me too.

353
00:38:22.916 --> 00:38:25.000
- There is no reception here.
- How come?

354
00:38:25.083 --> 00:38:27.958
Let me check it out. okay?

355
00:38:28.041 --> 00:38:29.208
Make it quick.

356
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.166
SLIDE

357
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:47.541
Thank you for waiting.

358
00:38:49.541 --> 00:38:50.791
So?

359
00:38:51.416 --> 00:38:55.916
It's just a minor technical issue.
The fifth car was detached from the train.

360
00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:00.125
The departure station staff
have handled it well

361
00:39:00.208 --> 00:39:03.041
and your luggage will be taken
to the resort immediately.

362
00:39:04.416 --> 00:39:08.333
What about the passengers
in the fifth car?

363
00:39:08.916 --> 00:39:13.125
They are doing fine
and will catch up to the resort soon.

364
00:39:23.291 --> 00:39:25.375
We've entered the tunnel.

365
00:39:25.458 --> 00:39:28.666
As an apology. we'll transfer you

366
00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:30.916
to Economy Class One in the fourth car.

367
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.958
We will also give you bonus points
that you can use for your next trip.

368
00:39:36.041 --> 00:39:37.208
What do you say?

369
00:39:40.083 --> 00:39:41.125
Okay.

370
00:39:52.166 --> 00:39:54.458
Miss. the ginger drink hasn't been paid.

371
00:40:48.958 --> 00:40:53.583
<i>- Let's sing and dance together
- Let's sing and dance together</i>

372
00:40:53.666 --> 00:40:57.583
<i>- Take away the sadness in your heart
- Take away the sadness in your heart</i>

373
00:40:57.666 --> 00:41:01.333
<i>- Let your heart be happy
- Let your heart be happy</i>

374
00:41:02.625 --> 00:41:04.625
One more time!

375
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.791
What's wrong with you?

376
00:41:16.666 --> 00:41:18.541
- What's wrong with him?
- What's wrong with him?

377
00:41:19.916 --> 00:41:22.916
- What's wrong with him?
- Get us some water!

378
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.583
- Give him some water!
- Water!

379
00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:32.500
You're dead!

380
00:41:33.708 --> 00:41:35.708
Annihilated!

381
00:41:48.291 --> 00:41:49.833
That's another one!

382
00:41:49.916 --> 00:41:51.083
You humans.

383
00:41:51.166 --> 00:41:52.625
don't think you can escape

384
00:41:52.708 --> 00:41:55.500
the punishment that will befall you!

385
00:41:55.583 --> 00:42:00.875
The punishment is coming down
on all of you!

386
00:42:00.958 --> 00:42:07.458
How can you be so greedy like this?

387
00:42:07.541 --> 00:42:09.125
Answer me!

388
00:42:09.208 --> 00:42:14.333
The time has come

389
00:42:14.416 --> 00:42:17.250
without you all realizing it.

390
00:42:17.333 --> 00:42:23.916
You won't be able
to evade this catastrophe.

391
00:42:24.708 --> 00:42:29.083
Annihilated!

392
00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:28.458
Thank you. miss.

393
00:43:37.083 --> 00:43:39.041
Get away from there. Purnama!

394
00:43:39.125 --> 00:43:40.875
- Come on!
- Where’s the car?

395
00:43:41.791 --> 00:43:43.125
Get away from there!

396
00:43:46.666 --> 00:43:47.958
Purnama!

397
00:43:48.958 --> 00:43:52.291
Those passengers were left behind…

398
00:43:55.291 --> 00:43:58.041
Those passengers…

399
00:43:58.125 --> 00:43:59.250
Where is the car?

400
00:43:59.333 --> 00:44:03.125
Those passengers…
They were like being held captive.

401
00:44:04.458 --> 00:44:06.333
- By other passengers?
- No.

402
00:44:09.416 --> 00:44:10.833
They are not human.

403
00:44:15.041 --> 00:44:16.875
- I want to get out of here.
- No.

404
00:44:16.958 --> 00:44:18.583
I can't take it anymore.

405
00:44:19.625 --> 00:44:20.708
What's wrong with her?

406
00:44:47.291 --> 00:44:50.875
You surely know something
about this. right?

407
00:44:52.916 --> 00:44:54.958
How could the car go missing?

408
00:45:03.708 --> 00:45:05.333
How did this happen?

409
00:45:07.083 --> 00:45:10.125
I don't know. sir. I'm sorry.

410
00:45:10.208 --> 00:45:12.416
You keep saying you don't know!

411
00:45:13.833 --> 00:45:15.583
One tunnel.

412
00:45:17.875 --> 00:45:19.708
one car's missing.

413
00:45:27.125 --> 00:45:29.625
One time…

414
00:45:32.208 --> 00:45:33.958
might have been a coincidence.

415
00:45:36.875 --> 00:45:38.625
but it happened twice.

416
00:45:39.666 --> 00:45:41.500
This must be a warning.

417
00:45:43.833 --> 00:45:46.291
This is not a technical issue.

418
00:45:47.458 --> 00:45:51.458
It's far beyond our control.

419
00:45:55.375 --> 00:45:58.875
How can a small area like ours
become developed

420
00:45:59.958 --> 00:46:03.875
if the thinking of its people
is as illogical as this lady's?

421
00:46:03.958 --> 00:46:06.625
She attributes
all kinds of things to superstition.

422
00:46:07.125 --> 00:46:08.708
No. I saw it with my own eyes.

423
00:46:09.958 --> 00:46:11.958
Those people in the car…

424
00:46:13.208 --> 00:46:16.708
They gathered in the center of the car.

425
00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:19.500
then there were these creatures that…

426
00:46:21.958 --> 00:46:24.208
You believe me. don't you?

427
00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:27.000
You saw it yourself.

428
00:46:27.583 --> 00:46:31.083
how your thoughtless thinking
can influence others. right?

429
00:46:34.958 --> 00:46:38.166
Mr. Santoso. you can take it easy.

430
00:46:39.166 --> 00:46:43.250
Those cars were just left in the tunnels.

431
00:46:44.375 --> 00:46:48.291
Tekun. have you contacted
the control center yet?

432
00:46:48.375 --> 00:46:49.833
I have. sir.

433
00:46:50.375 --> 00:46:54.500
The conductor is in constant communication
with the control center.

434
00:46:54.583 --> 00:46:57.791
Did you hear that?
Nothing to worry about. okay?

435
00:46:57.875 --> 00:47:01.958
All issues have been addressed
by our crew. Mr. Santoso.

436
00:47:02.041 --> 00:47:05.208
Now. we'd better get back to the cabin.

437
00:47:06.083 --> 00:47:07.541
You go ahead.

438
00:47:10.708 --> 00:47:11.791
All right.

439
00:47:19.875 --> 00:47:21.875
I really know nothing about this. sir.

440
00:47:27.708 --> 00:47:29.750
You have to get help at once

441
00:47:30.666 --> 00:47:32.958
and make the fourth car a priority

442
00:47:33.541 --> 00:47:37.791
before the press
makes horrible stories out of us.

443
00:47:42.708 --> 00:47:44.958
Did you hear me?

444
00:47:45.041 --> 00:47:48.458
The thing is.
our radio and antenna are down.

445
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:55.750
- Are you enjoying this trip?
- I am.

446
00:48:24.541 --> 00:48:25.875
Mr. Bara.

447
00:48:26.708 --> 00:48:28.750
Yes?

448
00:48:28.833 --> 00:48:31.958
Let's join the others for a dance.

449
00:48:32.791 --> 00:48:35.208
Okay. you go ahead.

450
00:48:35.291 --> 00:48:36.583
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

451
00:48:36.666 --> 00:48:37.750
- Do you promise?
- Yes.

452
00:48:38.583 --> 00:48:39.791
Shall we?

453
00:49:11.791 --> 00:49:14.541
Mr. Sidik. the fourth
and fifth cars are missing.

454
00:49:16.166 --> 00:49:18.333
I was just about to tell you about this.

455
00:49:18.416 --> 00:49:21.625
What should we do? Can't you
communicate with the control center?

456
00:49:21.708 --> 00:49:27.166
Somehow. the communication devices
on this train suddenly malfunctioned. sir.

457
00:49:28.375 --> 00:49:32.833
Okay. listen. we need to get
to the resort station ASAP.

458
00:49:32.916 --> 00:49:38.041
Once we arrive. we have to send a team
to evacuate passengers in those cars.

459
00:49:38.125 --> 00:49:44.958
We take them to the resort station.
then give them some VIP class services.

460
00:49:45.041 --> 00:49:51.541
Afterward. we ask them nicely
to sign an agreement not to sue us.

461
00:49:52.291 --> 00:49:57.250
Okay. that's if we can find those cars.
but what if we can't?

462
00:50:07.625 --> 00:50:09.166
Take a look at this. sir.

463
00:50:12.375 --> 00:50:15.708
They are real.

464
00:50:19.541 --> 00:50:21.208
- Delete it.
- What?

465
00:50:22.208 --> 00:50:29.166
What if people get suspicious
that one of the CCTV footage is missing?

466
00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:30.833
Just delete it.

467
00:50:30.916 --> 00:50:33.625
My men in the police department
will take care of it.

468
00:50:37.458 --> 00:50:39.166
It's done. sir.

469
00:50:40.416 --> 00:50:42.666
What should we do now?

470
00:50:46.416 --> 00:50:49.166
There's a woman in the economy class

471
00:50:50.458 --> 00:50:52.791
who seems to know about these demons.

472
00:50:52.875 --> 00:50:57.125
Don't let her influence
those passengers in other cars.

473
00:50:57.208 --> 00:50:58.750
- Can you do it?
- Yes. sir.

474
00:50:58.833 --> 00:51:02.625
Those investors are very important.
they are our future.

475
00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:05.708
- Do you get it?
- Yes. sir.

476
00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:10.291
Just calm down. okay?

477
00:51:11.375 --> 00:51:14.416
We're in this together.

478
00:51:33.958 --> 00:51:36.541
I'm sorry. sir. ma'am.

479
00:51:36.625 --> 00:51:38.166
Mr. Santoso…

480
00:51:40.041 --> 00:51:42.666
You should go back to the VIP cabin.

481
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.458
As a token of my apology.

482
00:51:49.541 --> 00:51:52.791
you can all enjoy the VIP facilities.

483
00:51:52.875 --> 00:51:54.041
That's not possible. sir.

484
00:51:56.416 --> 00:51:57.791
I'm sorry. sir.

485
00:51:58.958 --> 00:52:00.458
The VIP cabin is fully booked.

486
00:52:05.666 --> 00:52:08.541
Mr. Tekun will provide you
with good services.

487
00:52:10.625 --> 00:52:11.958
- Come on.
- Yes. sir.

488
00:52:12.041 --> 00:52:13.416
- Please.
- This way. ma'am.

489
00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.375
- I'll catch up later.
- Okay.

490
00:52:15.458 --> 00:52:17.041
Excuse me.

491
00:52:18.541 --> 00:52:20.833
- Ma'am.
- Mr. Santoso.

492
00:52:28.416 --> 00:52:29.875
I'm Ramla.

493
00:52:32.375 --> 00:52:34.000
My husband went missing.

494
00:52:35.625 --> 00:52:38.625
He built a railroad for Sangkara.

495
00:52:41.916 --> 00:52:44.125
- Sorry. ma'am--
- He never came home again.

496
00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:49.083
I entrusted this whole matter to Mr. Bara.

497
00:52:49.166 --> 00:52:52.875
I don't know anything.
not even about your husband.

498
00:53:01.583 --> 00:53:05.333
I'm sorry. miss.
There's only one seat available here.

499
00:53:06.958 --> 00:53:08.958
- Have a seat. Purnama.
- No. you go ahead.

500
00:53:09.958 --> 00:53:12.375
You need to have a good rest.

501
00:53:12.458 --> 00:53:14.458
You should obey me this time.

502
00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:16.916
Purnama…

503
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:25.083
So…

504
00:53:26.458 --> 00:53:27.750
what's going on here?

505
00:53:28.458 --> 00:53:30.041
It's a long story.

506
00:53:30.125 --> 00:53:31.708
I'll tell you later.

507
00:53:32.875 --> 00:53:35.541
Miss. what's the problem now?

508
00:53:35.625 --> 00:53:37.208
Everything is fine. miss.

509
00:53:40.416 --> 00:53:44.250
Welcome. Thank you for upgrading
your tickets to the VIP class.

510
00:53:48.458 --> 00:53:50.916
So what about Mr. Santoso?

511
00:53:51.958 --> 00:53:53.041
He's in the restaurant.

512
00:53:56.875 --> 00:53:58.500
Please take my place for a moment. okay?

513
00:53:58.583 --> 00:54:00.916
- Me?
- Yes. it's just for a second.

514
00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:08.708
Excuse me.

515
00:54:08.791 --> 00:54:10.041
Can I help you. miss?

516
00:54:10.125 --> 00:54:11.625
Do you have a minute?

517
00:54:11.708 --> 00:54:13.125
- Sure.
- Purnama.

518
00:54:14.125 --> 00:54:15.083
Purnama.

519
00:54:18.291 --> 00:54:19.875
- I'll be right back.
- No.

520
00:54:20.541 --> 00:54:21.750
It's okay.

521
00:54:47.666 --> 00:54:50.000
I can tell when people are lying to me

522
00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:55.916
and I noticed that every time you
explained to us about the missing cars.

523
00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:57.791
Just tell the truth.

524
00:55:00.416 --> 00:55:02.750
What is really going on here?

525
00:55:05.041 --> 00:55:09.250
I honestly don't know what happened.

526
00:55:10.583 --> 00:55:14.791
Up until now. I don't even know
if we will get help or not.

527
00:55:15.375 --> 00:55:18.500
You should have explained this
from the very beginning.

528
00:55:18.583 --> 00:55:20.708
Didn't you see
how terrified my sister was?

529
00:55:21.291 --> 00:55:24.458
I was just following orders from my boss.

530
00:55:24.541 --> 00:55:28.791
So this train is still running
just to follow your boss's orders?

531
00:55:28.875 --> 00:55:30.041
And you just keep silent?

532
00:55:30.125 --> 00:55:33.541
- We have to wait until the last station.
- You should've thought of our lives.

533
00:55:33.625 --> 00:55:34.541
That's the only way.

534
00:55:34.625 --> 00:55:39.166
You should be honest with everyone.
there's no need to use this silly excuse.

535
00:55:40.125 --> 00:55:42.291
I'm telling you the truth. miss.

536
00:55:51.583 --> 00:55:56.125
You know this VIP cabin is already full.

537
00:55:56.916 --> 00:55:58.916
but you still put them here?

538
00:56:00.041 --> 00:56:01.833
The cabin smells awful now.

539
00:56:03.083 --> 00:56:05.833
- You should take care of this.
- Sorry. miss.

540
00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:09.500
Come on.

541
00:56:48.666 --> 00:56:50.666
Suci. look at me.

542
00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:54.291
Don't look there.
Take a breath. relax yourself.

543
00:56:55.833 --> 00:56:56.791
It's okay.

544
00:56:56.875 --> 00:57:00.000
Indah. we've customers.

545
00:57:00.083 --> 00:57:03.250
- You'd better serve them now.
- Yes. sir.

546
00:57:03.333 --> 00:57:08.125
Sir. please allow me to join in.

547
00:57:08.208 --> 00:57:10.791
I'm scared of being alone here.

548
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:19.208
No. Suci. I don't want your condition
to draw the passengers' attention.

549
00:57:19.291 --> 00:57:23.125
So you'd better stay here
to compose yourself.

550
00:57:37.166 --> 00:57:38.625
- Anything else. ma'am?
- That's all.

551
00:57:38.708 --> 00:57:40.041
Yes. ma'am.

552
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.583
Please calm down. everyone.

553
00:57:58.875 --> 00:58:00.333
Suci!

554
00:58:04.166 --> 00:58:05.541
Suci!

555
00:58:13.583 --> 00:58:14.750
Suci.

556
00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:29.583
What's going on here. sir?

557
00:58:44.083 --> 00:58:45.208
Move.

558
00:58:50.375 --> 00:58:51.375
Be quiet.

559
00:58:55.083 --> 00:58:57.083
Nobody makes a sound.

560
00:58:59.083 --> 00:59:02.666
We have to get into
the second car right now.

561
00:59:03.583 --> 00:59:05.000
Hurry up!

562
00:59:23.583 --> 00:59:25.083
Sir?

563
00:59:25.166 --> 00:59:28.625
What sacred forest
are we passing through. sir?

564
00:59:32.791 --> 00:59:34.291
I have no idea. Indah.

565
00:59:34.875 --> 00:59:37.458
They seem to be the demons of this forest.

566
01:00:32.125 --> 01:00:34.791
Maya. don't move.

567
01:00:36.333 --> 01:00:37.541
Maya.

568
01:00:39.333 --> 01:00:40.666
Back off!

569
01:00:43.291 --> 01:00:44.791
I said back off!

570
01:01:06.208 --> 01:01:07.541
No!

571
01:01:40.625 --> 01:01:42.250
Tekun!

572
01:01:46.708 --> 01:01:50.000
Tekun! Please open this door!

573
01:01:52.541 --> 01:01:54.708
Come on. open it!

574
01:01:54.791 --> 01:01:56.625
I can't open this door.

575
01:01:57.208 --> 01:01:58.416
I can't!

576
01:01:59.083 --> 01:02:00.541
I can't open it. Indah!

577
01:02:00.625 --> 01:02:02.500
CAFETERIA

578
01:02:02.583 --> 01:02:04.458
Help me!

579
01:02:04.541 --> 01:02:06.083
Purnama. no!

580
01:02:07.041 --> 01:02:09.166
- Hang on!
- Purnama!

581
01:02:29.541 --> 01:02:30.833
Hold it!

582
01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:34.708
The third car disappeared! How come?

583
01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:37.791
We don't have time to explain them.

584
01:02:37.875 --> 01:02:39.208
Come on.

585
01:02:39.958 --> 01:02:41.208
What do we do now?

586
01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:43.666
What happened
to the third car's passengers?

587
01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:47.541
Mr. Sidik. we have to stop this train now.

588
01:02:47.625 --> 01:02:50.583
We have to see the driver before we enter
the fourth tunnel or else…

589
01:02:51.666 --> 01:02:53.708
This second car will disappear too.

590
01:02:53.791 --> 01:02:57.541
- How can this be?
- Don't mess around with us!

591
01:02:57.625 --> 01:02:58.458
Silent!

592
01:03:04.416 --> 01:03:05.958
They're gone. sir.

593
01:03:09.791 --> 01:03:14.416
I already knew and suspected
those three economy-class passengers.

594
01:03:15.916 --> 01:03:21.250
How could they have survived
despite the disappearance of those cars?

595
01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:25.500
They pretended to ask you for help.

596
01:03:26.708 --> 01:03:30.916
You're the one who locked
this car's emergency door. right?

597
01:03:32.541 --> 01:03:34.750
But how did this door open?

598
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:41.541
You conspired
to release the lower-class cars

599
01:03:41.625 --> 01:03:44.125
as they're not worth your while. right?

600
01:03:46.208 --> 01:03:51.458
And you have planned to order the driver

601
01:03:51.541 --> 01:03:54.208
to stop the upper-class cars

602
01:03:54.291 --> 01:03:57.625
when the train is isolated
from the outside world.

603
01:03:58.125 --> 01:04:00.708
And all the CCTV cameras are off.

604
01:04:01.833 --> 01:04:03.958
This whole scenario…

605
01:04:06.625 --> 01:04:07.875
is just a robbery attempt.

606
01:04:09.416 --> 01:04:11.666
Do you really want to rob us?

607
01:04:12.291 --> 01:04:14.708
We are not a bunch of robbers.

608
01:04:15.791 --> 01:04:17.541
This is a crime. man.

609
01:04:19.458 --> 01:04:23.958
How can we rob you?
We don't have any weapons. We're harmless.

610
01:04:24.041 --> 01:04:28.541
If you can disengage those cars.
who knows what else you can do?

611
01:04:35.666 --> 01:04:40.041
I won't let you rob me of my belongings!

612
01:04:48.416 --> 01:04:49.500
That's the tunnel!

613
01:04:53.375 --> 01:04:57.625
We have to move to that car
or we'll all die. come on!

614
01:04:57.708 --> 01:04:58.541
Purnama!

615
01:04:58.625 --> 01:05:00.541
Back off!

616
01:05:06.458 --> 01:05:07.958
Mr. Bara.

617
01:05:08.041 --> 01:05:11.083
What's going on. sir?

618
01:05:11.166 --> 01:05:13.333
Everyone. please stay calm.

619
01:05:13.416 --> 01:05:19.083
I just want to let you know that
there has been a robbery in the back car.

620
01:05:19.166 --> 01:05:20.208
- What?
- A robbery?

621
01:05:20.291 --> 01:05:21.666
- How come?
- But don't worry.

622
01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:24.708
I won't let those robbers
get into our car.

623
01:05:38.208 --> 01:05:39.583
No!

624
01:05:41.583 --> 01:05:42.416
Honey!

625
01:06:20.166 --> 01:06:23.583
Kris!

626
01:06:27.708 --> 01:06:28.708
Honey!

627
01:06:32.458 --> 01:06:35.500
Please don't die! Kris!

628
01:06:37.916 --> 01:06:40.375
Oh my God! They're murderers!

629
01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:44.333
They're murderers!
Let's get them! Come on!

630
01:06:47.291 --> 01:06:48.916
- Let's grab them!
- Purnama!

631
01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.041
- Grab them!
- Purnama!

632
01:06:51.125 --> 01:06:52.583
- Purnama!
- Let her go!

633
01:06:54.666 --> 01:06:56.291
Let her go!

634
01:06:58.333 --> 01:07:01.041
Tekun!

635
01:07:10.125 --> 01:07:12.208
I'll deal with the problem at once.

636
01:07:12.291 --> 01:07:13.833
Sidik. lock the door!

637
01:07:14.333 --> 01:07:16.958
- You guys stay calm. okay?
- Sir.

638
01:07:18.875 --> 01:07:20.625
- The third car disappeared?
- Yes. sir.

639
01:07:20.708 --> 01:07:23.000
- How come? Mr. Santoso was there.
- Yes. sir.

640
01:07:23.083 --> 01:07:25.625
- "Yes. sir." what?
- I don't know. sir.

641
01:07:27.291 --> 01:07:28.375
Let me try.

642
01:07:28.458 --> 01:07:29.791
It can't be opened!

643
01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:33.666
Step back.

644
01:07:38.916 --> 01:07:45.458
If you believe in God. you'd better pray
that we get to the resort sooner. sir.

645
01:07:58.166 --> 01:08:00.375
- Can you move?
- Yes.

646
01:08:04.583 --> 01:08:05.958
Look out behind you. Tekun!

647
01:08:07.208 --> 01:08:08.333
Where are you going?

648
01:08:09.583 --> 01:08:13.916
Sir. please trust me.
We need to get to the first car right now.

649
01:08:14.666 --> 01:08:18.125
Because every time we go into the tunnel.
that abomination appears.

650
01:08:18.208 --> 01:08:20.250
Take it easy. okay?

651
01:08:20.333 --> 01:08:23.083
Put it down first. okay?

652
01:08:24.625 --> 01:08:27.000
That's better.

653
01:08:33.625 --> 01:08:35.833
We've entered the tunnel.
Everyone. let's go!

654
01:08:35.916 --> 01:08:37.625
Kill them all!

655
01:08:37.708 --> 01:08:39.166
- Come on!
- You bastard!

656
01:08:51.916 --> 01:08:53.250
Die!

657
01:08:54.458 --> 01:08:55.458
Finish him!

658
01:08:58.041 --> 01:08:59.208
Prepare to die!

659
01:09:02.291 --> 01:09:03.625
Oh my God!

660
01:09:04.416 --> 01:09:05.583
Come on!

661
01:09:58.625 --> 01:10:01.083
- Help!
- Help!

662
01:10:07.875 --> 01:10:08.875
Help!

663
01:10:53.958 --> 01:10:55.666
Open the door!

664
01:11:02.166 --> 01:11:03.541
Open it!

665
01:11:09.583 --> 01:11:10.750
Thank God!

666
01:11:12.083 --> 01:11:13.375
Get in!

667
01:11:37.416 --> 01:11:39.291
Please. open the door!

668
01:11:40.291 --> 01:11:41.750
Sir!

669
01:11:44.708 --> 01:11:46.500
Please help me!

670
01:11:46.583 --> 01:11:48.333
Please open the door. sir.

671
01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:07.041
Purnama. what's wrong?

672
01:12:07.125 --> 01:12:09.375
I just killed a guy!

673
01:12:09.458 --> 01:12:12.625
No. you didn't do it on purpose.

674
01:12:12.708 --> 01:12:15.375
- But I killed that guy!
- No. you didn't.

675
01:12:15.458 --> 01:12:17.250
No. you didn't.

676
01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:20.916
We have to stop this train now.

677
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.583
- Right now. please!
- Calm down.

678
01:12:22.666 --> 01:12:25.666
Tekun. we need to get
to the resort quickly

679
01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:28.583
so they can send a team
to rescue those passengers.

680
01:12:28.666 --> 01:12:30.083
- He's right.
- We can't do that. sir.

681
01:12:30.166 --> 01:12:33.916
- Those demons will be here soon.
- Calm down!

682
01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.416
- I beg you. sir!
- Calm down.

683
01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:39.416
- Don't let us enter another tunnel.
- Hold on. what just happened back there?

684
01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:40.625
What's going on here?

685
01:12:40.708 --> 01:12:43.375
- Give me the key. I'll stop this train.
- What will happen to us?

686
01:12:43.458 --> 01:12:45.083
Every time we enter a tunnel…

687
01:12:46.875 --> 01:12:49.541
You just stay here and watch them. okay?

688
01:12:49.625 --> 01:12:50.916
Yes. sir.

689
01:12:59.875 --> 01:13:01.250
Open this door.

690
01:13:11.291 --> 01:13:12.458
Increase the speed.

691
01:13:14.416 --> 01:13:15.583
What do you mean?

692
01:13:15.666 --> 01:13:18.041
I said increase the speed.

693
01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:21.458
But Mr. Sidik…

694
01:13:21.541 --> 01:13:24.291
He's doing something else.
Increase the speed!

695
01:13:26.291 --> 01:13:27.750
What?

696
01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:29.541
- What?
- Yes. sir.

697
01:13:37.125 --> 01:13:40.416
- No. please. We must stop this train.
- Listen to me!

698
01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:42.375
Mr. Bara will stop this train.

699
01:13:42.458 --> 01:13:44.708
Everything will be fine.
so please calm down.

700
01:13:44.791 --> 01:13:47.250
Please stop this train right now. sir.

701
01:13:47.333 --> 01:13:49.583
- Please. sir!
- We will. I understand.

702
01:13:53.333 --> 01:13:54.333
The door is locked!

703
01:13:55.166 --> 01:13:56.625
But why?

704
01:14:01.333 --> 01:14:02.833
- Mr. Bara!
- Open this door!

705
01:14:02.916 --> 01:14:04.916
Open this door. Mr. Bara!

706
01:14:05.541 --> 01:14:09.083
Open it. Mr. Bara!

707
01:14:17.791 --> 01:14:18.875
Hurry!

708
01:14:20.625 --> 01:14:22.166
Everyone step back!

709
01:14:27.208 --> 01:14:28.333
Come on!

710
01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.250
- Be careful. Okay.
- Wait here. okay?

711
01:14:41.625 --> 01:14:42.833
Open this door!

712
01:14:42.916 --> 01:14:43.958
Keep working!

713
01:14:44.041 --> 01:14:47.666
Open this door! I'm in charge here!

714
01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:50.083
He's your boss. but I am his boss.

715
01:14:50.166 --> 01:14:51.833
Keep working!

716
01:14:51.916 --> 01:14:53.333
Bara!

717
01:14:56.041 --> 01:14:58.958
Although you're the leader in this area.

718
01:14:59.583 --> 01:15:06.041
on this train.
I hold the ultimate authority.

719
01:15:09.625 --> 01:15:10.916
Now open this door.

720
01:15:17.541 --> 01:15:20.541
Reduce the speed and stop this train now!

721
01:15:22.708 --> 01:15:23.708
Don't do it. sir!

722
01:15:23.791 --> 01:15:25.666
Otherwise. all of us will die!

723
01:15:30.166 --> 01:15:31.458
Get off me!

724
01:15:34.875 --> 01:15:36.500
Tekun!

725
01:16:41.708 --> 01:16:46.916
You must pay for what you did to Tekun.

726
01:16:51.916 --> 01:16:57.125
I thought if this first car
disappears in the fifth tunnel.

727
01:16:57.791 --> 01:17:04.041
the driver and I have to get
to the resort as soon as possible

728
01:17:04.125 --> 01:17:07.708
and immediately send help here
to evacuate you all.

729
01:17:07.791 --> 01:17:10.041
That's my only plan.

730
01:17:10.125 --> 01:17:12.541
I'm actually worried about you guys.

731
01:17:12.625 --> 01:17:15.125
Stop talking already!

732
01:17:17.375 --> 01:17:19.125
You've made a lot of trouble.

733
01:17:23.916 --> 01:17:29.208
Okay. so this train stops
so we don't enter the tunnel. right?

734
01:17:29.291 --> 01:17:31.791
Because every time
this train entered a tunnel…

735
01:17:35.416 --> 01:17:37.250
the demons attacked us.

736
01:17:39.041 --> 01:17:43.375
But how can we get
to that resort station without this train?

737
01:17:44.833 --> 01:17:47.500
The resort station
is not too far from here.

738
01:17:48.541 --> 01:17:51.458
We can walk through the forest
to get there.

739
01:17:53.333 --> 01:17:57.250
Yeah. the last tunnel
is not so far away from the resort.

740
01:17:58.375 --> 01:17:59.625
We just need to go straight.

741
01:17:59.708 --> 01:18:05.208
But if the rescue team is looking
for us now. we'll be safer on this train.

742
01:18:07.125 --> 01:18:08.875
Where's my husband?

743
01:18:11.125 --> 01:18:12.625
I don't know him.

744
01:18:13.375 --> 01:18:14.375
This man.

745
01:18:16.083 --> 01:18:17.708
This is my husband.

746
01:18:19.666 --> 01:18:21.666
I really don't know your husband.

747
01:18:22.833 --> 01:18:25.291
Take a good look at his clothes.

748
01:18:26.125 --> 01:18:27.125
Here.

749
01:18:28.833 --> 01:18:31.083
My husband worked for Sangkara.

750
01:18:33.708 --> 01:18:35.041
For you.

751
01:18:39.083 --> 01:18:41.833
Did you give money to Sangkara?

752
01:18:42.958 --> 01:18:44.958
Did you too?

753
01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:47.583
All of you too?

754
01:18:47.666 --> 01:18:50.666
That means my husband worked
for all of you too.

755
01:18:51.791 --> 01:18:52.708
Darto.

756
01:18:54.916 --> 01:18:56.458
Wiryo Sudarto.

757
01:18:57.750 --> 01:19:02.833
That's my husband's name and he has never
complained about his work.

758
01:19:02.916 --> 01:19:04.375
He was a hard worker.

759
01:19:05.458 --> 01:19:09.000
He worked hard
to buy me a new hearing aid.

760
01:19:10.166 --> 01:19:12.000
I knew he went missing.

761
01:19:12.083 --> 01:19:16.291
When the device was delivered
to my house. he never came back.

762
01:19:18.208 --> 01:19:21.583
Thanks to this device. I could hear

763
01:19:22.125 --> 01:19:27.541
that those women were looking
for their husbands and brothers.

764
01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:32.375
I talked to Mr. Santoso.

765
01:19:33.041 --> 01:19:36.250
He had no idea
that his workers were missing.

766
01:19:38.875 --> 01:19:43.375
He said all railway construction matters

767
01:19:46.041 --> 01:19:48.291
had been handed over to local officials.

768
01:19:54.708 --> 01:19:58.250
It's not me.

769
01:19:58.333 --> 01:19:59.666
I swear to God.

770
01:19:59.750 --> 01:20:01.583
That's enough.

771
01:20:03.166 --> 01:20:06.500
Enough to make God angry
with your actions.

772
01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:10.083
Look at them.

773
01:20:12.375 --> 01:20:15.166
They bear the consequences
of your actions.

774
01:20:15.250 --> 01:20:17.708
<i>You take a look at this.</i>

775
01:20:18.541 --> 01:20:21.458
You extended the railroad too much.

776
01:20:21.541 --> 01:20:25.458
It's because the resort
is blocked by the forest. sir.

777
01:20:25.541 --> 01:20:29.541
This is why your design
didn't give us much profit.

778
01:20:29.625 --> 01:20:34.125
This Alas Geti forest
is surrounded by rocky hills. sir.

779
01:20:34.208 --> 01:20:39.791
Yes. but we can cut through the path here.

780
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.125
Be smart. okay?

781
01:20:44.208 --> 01:20:49.208
With my design. we can tell Mr. Santoso

782
01:20:49.291 --> 01:20:53.541
that the train passengers
will get a better view of the scenery.

783
01:20:53.625 --> 01:20:56.916
so we can ask Mr. Santoso for more money.

784
01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.416
Don't worry. you'll get your share.

785
01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:00.875
We can't do that. sir.

786
01:21:02.041 --> 01:21:04.041
This forest belongs to something else.

787
01:21:05.875 --> 01:21:08.041
You mind your own business.

788
01:21:08.125 --> 01:21:11.250
You take care of the occult things
and stay out of this matter.

789
01:21:11.333 --> 01:21:14.083
This forest is inhabited
by not just any demons.

790
01:21:14.916 --> 01:21:17.416
No faith that can subdue them.

791
01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:19.833
no ritual offerings or sacrifices.

792
01:21:19.916 --> 01:21:22.250
It's about their home. sir.

793
01:21:38.625 --> 01:21:40.791
Look. Rahmat.

794
01:21:42.750 --> 01:21:46.375
if it wasn't for the governor.
you wouldn't be here.

795
01:21:47.125 --> 01:21:52.958
So don't think that you can blackmail me
with your cheap superstitious things.

796
01:21:54.250 --> 01:21:56.666
I'm begging you. sir.

797
01:21:58.083 --> 01:21:59.416
Call it off.

798
01:22:01.708 --> 01:22:02.958
or they will be furious

799
01:22:04.458 --> 01:22:07.666
and the punishment
will be far more painful than death.

800
01:22:12.916 --> 01:22:14.125
This…

801
01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:20.041
This is mine. okay?

802
01:22:22.458 --> 01:22:25.041
Mr. Rahmat. come with me.

803
01:22:26.666 --> 01:22:28.958
- I beg you. sir.
- Come with me.

804
01:22:29.041 --> 01:22:30.000
Come with me.

805
01:22:36.208 --> 01:22:37.958
No one will be able to help you.

806
01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:41.166
Not your money.

807
01:22:42.375 --> 01:22:44.166
not even God.

808
01:22:46.625 --> 01:22:51.083
<i>He deliberately assigned me to this train</i>

809
01:22:52.125 --> 01:22:57.500
so that his insidious secret
wouldn't be exposed.

810
01:22:58.166 --> 01:22:59.458
What are you talking about?

811
01:23:00.041 --> 01:23:02.541
Isn’t that right. Mr. Regent?

812
01:23:04.458 --> 01:23:07.916
Come on. you can take it easy.

813
01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.833
We're in this together.

814
01:23:47.083 --> 01:23:48.083
Come on.

815
01:23:58.083 --> 01:23:59.833
What do we do now?

816
01:23:59.916 --> 01:24:01.125
Where should we go?

817
01:24:01.625 --> 01:24:03.916
As I recall.
we have to go around this tunnel.

818
01:24:07.333 --> 01:24:08.291
That way.

819
01:24:08.875 --> 01:24:10.375
We can just walk to the station.

820
01:24:11.291 --> 01:24:12.583
Are you sure?

821
01:24:14.708 --> 01:24:15.833
I'm sure.

822
01:24:28.166 --> 01:24:30.500
They're in the tunnel.

823
01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:35.041
What just happened?

824
01:24:35.125 --> 01:24:37.333
Let's get going!

825
01:24:39.333 --> 01:24:40.791
Honey!

826
01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:45.916
Purnama.

827
01:24:51.958 --> 01:24:53.541
They come out because of the darkness.

828
01:24:54.833 --> 01:24:56.541
not because of the tunnel.

829
01:24:56.625 --> 01:24:58.833
- Let's go that way!
- Purnama!

830
01:24:58.916 --> 01:25:00.333
We have to run!

831
01:25:01.041 --> 01:25:02.791
This way. come on!

832
01:25:02.875 --> 01:25:06.708
- Come on. we've got to run!
- Purnama!

833
01:25:21.458 --> 01:25:22.666
Ms. Ningrum.

834
01:25:38.541 --> 01:25:40.000
Why?

835
01:25:43.958 --> 01:25:45.833
Can't you find another route?

836
01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:49.583
Why did you have to destroy my forest?

837
01:25:50.666 --> 01:25:54.625
It's the nature of humankind like you

838
01:25:56.416 --> 01:26:01.250
to destroy each other for an inch of land.

839
01:26:02.166 --> 01:26:04.916
You greedy human!

840
01:26:08.041 --> 01:26:10.041
You are the proof

841
01:26:11.708 --> 01:26:13.083
that God

842
01:26:13.791 --> 01:26:17.583
has wrongfully put humans on Earth.

843
01:26:17.666 --> 01:26:21.416
Please forgive me!

844
01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:11.541
Let's go this way. come on!

845
01:27:18.833 --> 01:27:20.041
Where's everybody?

846
01:28:19.666 --> 01:28:21.000
Watch your step!

847
01:28:24.458 --> 01:28:28.125
- What is it?
- That lady is missing.

848
01:28:28.750 --> 01:28:32.333
- We don't have time to look for her.
- Come on. ma'am.

849
01:28:32.416 --> 01:28:34.333
- Let's go!
- No!

850
01:28:34.916 --> 01:28:36.791
If Darto is here.

851
01:28:37.708 --> 01:28:40.041
he will definitely look for her.

852
01:28:48.458 --> 01:28:49.875
Kembang…

853
01:28:53.625 --> 01:28:54.708
and…

854
01:28:55.500 --> 01:28:56.583
Purnama.

855
01:28:57.875 --> 01:28:59.458
Purnama.

856
01:29:06.041 --> 01:29:07.458
I'm Ramla.

857
01:29:11.125 --> 01:29:12.250
Hi. Ramla.

858
01:29:16.041 --> 01:29:17.375
Be careful.

859
01:29:28.833 --> 01:29:31.416
Let's go this way.

860
01:29:32.458 --> 01:29:33.625
Purnama.

861
01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:40.250
Where are we going?

862
01:29:41.041 --> 01:29:42.875
The station must be over there.

863
01:29:42.958 --> 01:29:44.375
Let's go.

864
01:30:24.375 --> 01:30:25.916
Please forgive me.

865
01:31:16.041 --> 01:31:17.166
Purnama.

866
01:31:19.458 --> 01:31:20.500
Purnama.

867
01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.250
I want to go home.

868
01:31:22.333 --> 01:31:24.416
- I don't want to be here!
- Kembang.

869
01:31:26.250 --> 01:31:28.125
I can't move!

870
01:31:31.166 --> 01:31:34.125
I just want to go home.

871
01:31:34.750 --> 01:31:36.666
Yeah. we're going home. okay?

872
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
I'm freezing.

873
01:31:41.083 --> 01:31:43.208
I'll find a way to be free of this.

874
01:31:43.291 --> 01:31:46.166
I can't feel anything.

875
01:31:50.791 --> 01:31:53.583
But it hurts.

876
01:31:57.916 --> 01:31:59.916
What happened to my face?

877
01:32:01.375 --> 01:32:03.666
- Purnama!
- Kembang!

878
01:32:05.416 --> 01:32:06.458
Kembang!

879
01:32:10.083 --> 01:32:12.208
Kembang!

880
01:32:28.708 --> 01:32:30.708
Thank God. I'm free. Kembang.

881
01:32:42.458 --> 01:32:43.958
Kembang?

882
01:32:46.333 --> 01:32:47.875
Kembang.

883
01:32:50.208 --> 01:32:54.083
Kembang. Wake up.

884
01:32:55.416 --> 01:32:57.458
Kembang!

885
01:33:00.541 --> 01:33:04.125
You can't leave me alone here.
Come on. wake up.

886
01:33:04.208 --> 01:33:07.750
You're not going to leave me. are you?

887
01:33:14.458 --> 01:33:16.916
I can't stand being alone!

888
01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.666
Please don't leave me!

889
01:33:38.958 --> 01:33:41.166
Take me!

890
01:33:41.250 --> 01:33:43.833
Just take me. not my sister!

891
01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:47.500
Please take me instead!

892
01:33:50.541 --> 01:33:52.541
Not my sister!

893
01:34:17.666 --> 01:34:20.750
Kembang!

894
01:34:26.541 --> 01:34:28.541
Kembang!

895
01:34:51.166 --> 01:34:53.625
{\an8}If the deaths of the builders
weren't enough.

896
01:34:54.916 --> 01:34:57.750
{\an8}why didn't the demons just
finish off Mr. Bara in the first place?

897
01:34:59.750 --> 01:35:03.916
The death of Mr. Bara in the first place
won't stop people like him from emerging.

898
01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:12.416
Those demons need time
to set up this warning.

899
01:35:14.458 --> 01:35:17.083
Why can't I be part of them?

900
01:35:17.666 --> 01:35:19.625
For them. we are just soil.

901
01:35:21.708 --> 01:35:23.333
And you are

902
01:35:25.041 --> 01:35:26.916
a less fertile soil.

903
01:35:47.291 --> 01:35:48.333
Please.

904
01:36:17.958 --> 01:36:19.041
What do you say?

905
01:36:23.208 --> 01:36:24.583
I'm still pretty. right?

906
01:36:28.083 --> 01:36:29.708
You were right.

907
01:36:31.083 --> 01:36:33.375
I can beat the doctor's prediction.

908
01:36:37.791 --> 01:36:42.041
So you still have hope
of seeing my hair turn gray.

909
01:36:43.625 --> 01:36:45.583
<i>Look at me!</i>

910
01:36:45.666 --> 01:36:49.208
You must continue your treatment
until you're cured!

911
01:36:49.708 --> 01:36:53.291
You have to stay with me
because I want to see your hair turn gray!

912
01:37:05.375 --> 01:37:07.916
Hey. listen to me.

913
01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.875
- Purnama.
- Listen to me.

914
01:37:10.458 --> 01:37:13.375
I will continue my treatment.

915
01:37:13.458 --> 01:37:16.291
You have to keep me company. okay?

916
01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:19.000
You can do that. right?

917
01:37:20.458 --> 01:37:23.250
I miss you so much.

918
01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.333
I should have listened to you
in the first place.

919
01:37:37.125 --> 01:37:39.375
I should have kept fighting.

920
01:37:49.375 --> 01:37:51.041
Please forgive me.

921
01:38:00.250 --> 01:38:02.083
I can only hope

922
01:38:03.166 --> 01:38:05.375
that you are in a better place now.
