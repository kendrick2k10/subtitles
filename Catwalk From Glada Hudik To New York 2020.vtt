3
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.980
I'm on my way to Gislaved.
to Emma Örtlund.

4
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.700
A couple of years ago
I received a letter from Emma.

5
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.100
Emma describes her longing to be
beautiful. be seen and occupy space.

6
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.260
"Hey. Pär. My name is Emma Örtlund
and I live in Småland.

7
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.620
I have a special charisma.

8
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.380
and wonder if you can help me
become a model.

9
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:22.020
I have the charisma required.

10
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.740
and a photographer friend
thinks so too.

11
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.540
I've dreamed of this my whole life.
so. what do you say?"

12
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.660
The letter touched me greatly.
because...

13
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.580
it put words to so many things
I experience

14
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.380
in our society. and what I do.
and everything I believe in.

15
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.340
My job is to help those who haven't
had the chance to be seen and shine.

16
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.580
I think Emma really deserves it.

17
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:09.620
So the letter is the starting point
for why we're on this journey.

18
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:05.300
CATWALK
FROM GLADA HUDIK TO NEW YORK

19
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.380
-Hey!
-Hey. Emma!

20
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:27.780
-Are you standing in the stairs?
-I wasn't sure if you'd found it.

21
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.100
-It's so nice to see you.
-You too!

22
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.660
-Is this where you live?
-This is where I live.

23
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.660
-Is my lipstick messy?
-You look great.

24
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.180
Thanks so much.

25
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.260
-What a lovely apartment you have.
-Thank you so much.

26
00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.340
-It's fantastic.
-Yes. it's absolutely fantastic.

27
00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.180
It's original '80s. that clown.
the pink one over there.

28
00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.300
You wrote a letter to me.
I read it many times.

29
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.620
and thought about it and lay
sleepless. "What am I going to do?"

30
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:12.660
I told you I was on tour
but that wasn't really true.

31
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.660
Oh no?!

32
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.580
I'm here to tell you that
I'm going to try to help you

33
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.140
fulfil your dream.
that you're going to be a real model.

34
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.420
Oh my god. amazing!

35
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.180
You're going to walk on a catwalk.

36
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.100
I'm so happy! Oh my god!

37
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.980
Is this "Candid Camera"? Wow!

38
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.820
Wow. I'm so happy!

39
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.300
-Hey. Ida!
<i>-Hey. there.</i>

40
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:05.380
-Hey. How are you?
<i>-I'm great.</i>

41
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.580
-I've got some amazing news.
<i>-What is it?</i>

42
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.580
Pär told me

43
00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.980
that I'm going to be
photographed as a model

44
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.300
and walk on a catwalk.
And you will too!

45
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.900
<i>-Really?</i>
-Yes. really. Ida!

46
00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.420
<i>Wow. gosh. how amazing!</i>

47
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.780
You have such fantastic charisma
and you're so beautiful!

48
00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.620
<i>-Damn. how amazing!</i>
-It's so amazing!

49
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.100
<i>-So you and me?</i>
-Yes. and a few others.

50
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:48.260
SIX MONTHS UNTIL THE CATWALK

51
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.620
I've called you here for a reason.

52
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.700
Together. we're going to do
a fashion show. our own catwalk.

53
00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.140
Ida. you're going to transform the
catwalk into something special.

54
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.220
Yes. I can do that.

55
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.860
I don't think anyone's ever seen a
ballerina dance around on a catwalk.

56
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:17.220
Hillberg. you're Glada Hudik
Theatre's own primadonna.

57
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.860
You have all the necessary qualities.

58
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.380
You're beautiful
and you have your own style.

59
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.300
-You like glitter too. right?
-Mm.

60
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.420
Kitty. you're a person
who embodies fashion.

61
00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:40.100
You're a mix of culture and fashion
that I've never seen.

62
00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:51.540
Alex. you're a very thoughtful person
who can hold the group together well.

63
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.860
You have a charisma
that needs to be absorbed.

64
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.700
-And Emma...
-Yes?

65
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.580
You're the reason
we're sitting here.

66
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:08.540
Yes.

67
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.500
I think you should have the chance to
shine together with everyone else.

68
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.500
I think so too.

69
00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:19.620
I think everyone's charisma makes
this something very magical.

70
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.500
-It's a dream.
-Yes.

71
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.060
It's really a dream to do this.

72
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:29.220
I've never been seen before
in my life.

73
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:34.420
I could never have imagined that
I'd be part of something like this.

74
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:39.460
-This is a real crying party.
-Sorry. they're tears of happiness!

75
00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.340
-Happiness now.
-Yes.

76
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:46.420
-We'll start by watching a film.
-Okay.

77
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.900
Then you'll see.

78
00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:04.740
-Can you see yourselves there?
-Yes.

79
00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:11.780
You could see there that she had
a little smile. compared to her.

80
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.180
I think that's how you should look
when you walk.

81
00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:18.900
Oh?
Could you look that serious?

82
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:24.980
No. I'd have been happy.
to show that it's fun.

83
00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:29.780
-Don't they think it's fun?
-They're probably very unhappy...

84
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.140
because they have to diet. I think.

85
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:38.020
-Are we going to diet for this?
-No. that's not necessary.

86
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.740
You should be able to do things
regardless of how you look

87
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.020
or how you are.

88
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.740
The more we show
how we are as people.

89
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:49.660
that we're all different
and unique in our different ways.

90
00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:56.020
I actually think the clothes can
become more and more beautiful.

91
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.860
What do you think. Hillberg?

92
00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:11.060
-There.
-Yes.

93
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:17.140
I have to ask...
Can we do this?

94
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.980
-Yes.
-Absolutely.

95
00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.860
It'll be a tough
but fantastic journey.

96
00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.540
I don't think we can do it alone.

97
00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.940
-No...
-We need help.

98
00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:37.540
I think it's really important
to be a model.

99
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.060
I want people to see

100
00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:45.780
that people like us
who have disabilities

101
00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:49.220
are also unique people.

102
00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:54.660
This is more me
than the job I have now.

103
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.100
-Hey. there.
-Hey.

104
00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:06.180
-I'd like some coffee. please.
-Yes. Coming right up.

105
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:18.660
So... there you go.

106
00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:22.500
-There. yes.
-A biscuit and coffee.

107
00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:28.580
So. Andreas.
I have some amazing news to tell you.

108
00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:33.220
-Oh?
-Yes. Pär Johansson...

109
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:38.820
is going to help me
realise my big dream

110
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:44.020
of becoming a photo model
and walk on a catwalk.

111
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:49.780
-What's a catwalk?
-It's a fashion show.

112
00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:56.340
You strut like this
and wear nice clothes.

113
00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:02.820
-It's hard. right?
-You just do this. I'll show you.

114
00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.260
Oh...

115
00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:13.380
Yep. Pär is so nice.
I think he'll make my dream possible.

116
00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:16.980
-Hey.
-Hey!

117
00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:22.260
Three pieces of sponge cake.
You can put them on a napkin.

118
00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.900
There you go.

119
00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:33.780
My problems...

120
00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.980
I have epilepsy.

121
00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:40.740
I've had it since I was 15.

122
00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:46.380
The medicines didn't work on me.

123
00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:51.060
So I had seizures really often.

124
00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.780
I had it a lot at school

125
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:58.500
in the dining hall
and at the bus stop.

126
00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:08.660
So I stayed at home.
and didn't do anything.

127
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.020
I didn't go out anywhere.

128
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:17.140
I didn't dare go out for five years.

129
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:21.140
I was so very scared
of having seizures.

130
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:27.700
I was very lonely.
I was so lonely.

131
00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:53.140
Glada Hudik Theatre is comprised
of people with a passion

132
00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.380
for what we're doing.

133
00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:59.540
I'm good at finding people
who are better than me.

134
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:04.660
Who improve this. I shoot
an arrow and people follow it.

135
00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:09.220
Sometimes it misses the target and
others have to get it back on track.

136
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:13.060
So I'm probably
a really annoying leader. I think.

137
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:19.420
-You're looking very serious!
-No. We're focused.

138
00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:25.700
This will lead to a fashion show
starting in Hudiksvall.

139
00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:29.780
And then it'll go somewhere.

140
00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:35.220
I've decided. the group doesn't know
yet. that we're going to New York.

141
00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.540
For fashion week.

142
00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:42.020
-No...
-Yes.

143
00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:45.540
I can't do it alone.
that's why you're here.

144
00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.940
The group doesn't know
that it's New York

145
00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.260
and they don't know
it's New York because

146
00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:55.620
then they'd miss the journey there.
The journey is just as important.

147
00:13:55.700 --> 00:14:00.180
You're saying New York...
How certain is that?

148
00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:06.420
I see it is about 83% certain.

149
00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:10.420
-Venue?
-Venue. I'm working on that.

150
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:14.580
We start with
a traditional fashion show.

151
00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:17.620
Model 1. 2. 3. 4 will display clothes

152
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:23.220
that are placed on bodies
within that industry.

153
00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:26.740
Everyone looks the same.
We'll break that mould.

154
00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:31.460
How will the actual...
I've got a thousand thoughts.

155
00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:34.660
Will there be five models?
How many costume changes.

156
00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:38.500
How long will the show be?

157
00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:43.220
We're not after quantity.
we're after quality.

158
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.100
So I think...

159
00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:49.700
I've never done a fashion show but it
should be between 15 and 18 minutes.

160
00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:53.540
I don't know what makes me say that.
but it feels good.

161
00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:54.820
It shouldn't be too long.

162
00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:58.340
It should be vigorous. efficient
and have forward momentum.

163
00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:01.940
-Questions?
-A thousand questions.

164
00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:04.580
Chrystal clear
and a thousand questions.

165
00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:17.140
We're here for a reason. During this
journey. you will become a team.

166
00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:19.860
You'll work together.

167
00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.620
We're doing something tomorrow.

168
00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:28.740
I want you to be ready in warm
clothes at 9 o'clock tomorrow.

169
00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:31.780
-Nine... what did you say?
-Nine o'clock.

170
00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:34.660
We're going dog sledding.

171
00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.540
Ida doesn't look too happy.

172
00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:45.940
I can see myself falling down.

173
00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:50.580
-Have you done it before?
-No. I've never done it before.

174
00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:54.740
-There's no ice or anything?
-Yes. we're going out on the ice.

175
00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:10.420
So. I found them.

176
00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:15.060
Pink earplugs.

177
00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:21.940
Kitty. Here. There you go.

178
00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:27.220
-Do you want earplugs. Nicklas?
-No. I've got these.

179
00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:35.340
-I don't know if I can do it. Kitty.
-Yeah. you can.

180
00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:42.020
I've got nerves right now.
I'm surely going to fall.

181
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:47.300
-Get on here.
-Ida. you won't fall off.

182
00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.940
You can hold onto me.

183
00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:55.740
-It'll go great.
-Ida. how does it feel? Ida?

184
00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.340
I don't understand why I'm doing it.

185
00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:05.220
We're overcoming our fears
and dare to come past this. Right?

186
00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:10.260
-Yes. That's what I have to do.
-You're already on the dogsled.

187
00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:13.700
Yes... But they haven't started.

188
00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:25.060
-So. Lean back against me.
-I don't know...

189
00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:29.020
-I'll wet myself soon.
-Are you scared?

190
00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:33.380
-I'm wetting myself!
-Ida says she'll wet herself soon.

191
00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.740
Ida! Look! Watch.

192
00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.420
Now hold on!

193
00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.620
-Are you okay?
-Yes!

194
00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:56.100
Here we go!

195
00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.500
-God. it's amazing!
-Isn't it!

196
00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.580
Yes.

197
00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:20.420
Hey. Pär? I've overcome my fear!

198
00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.460
Now we're going downhill!

199
00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:36.460
So much fun!

200
00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:42.980
God. it's amazing. Wonderful.

201
00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:49.700
It's wonderful to get to know the
gang. I'm going to be one of them.

202
00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:54.260
It's like I fit in here.

203
00:18:54.340 --> 00:19:01.220
There's so much joy and strength.
We believe in each other.

204
00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:05.140
We've all helped out.

205
00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.140
We're strong together.

206
00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:24.420
FIVE MONTHS UNTIL THE CATWALK

207
00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:29.300
-Here I am. Dad!
-Hey. honey!

208
00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:38.100
-Wow. have you hung up the paintings?
-Yes.

209
00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:42.660
I think they're so nice.
-I can understand that.

210
00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:46.180
I painted that picture...

211
00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.580
when I was in high school.

212
00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:53.060
I really wanted to go to the ball.
I remember that.

213
00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:56.260
I thought it would be like
Cinderella's ball.

214
00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:02.820
I dreamed and fantasised a lot about
being the queen of the ball.

215
00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.220
A guy would be the king of the ball.

216
00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:12.500
But I had so much anxiety
and was bullied and harassed.

217
00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:15.380
So it was a horrible time.

218
00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:20.220
I felt bad every day
I went to school.

219
00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:26.980
-How awful that you had that anxiety.
-Yes. It was really awful.

220
00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:32.660
At school they yelled at me and
called me spastic every day

221
00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.220
and pushed me into walls.

222
00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:40.340
They messed with me. a lot.

223
00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.740
They weren't nice.

224
00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:47.060
I didn't feel welcome at that school.

225
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:52.500
But you did something then.
that wasn't so great.

226
00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.620
It was really something
you shouldn't do.

227
00:20:55.700 --> 00:21:00.660
I thought.
"If they're mean to me today.

228
00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:05.620
I'll damn well go
and get a big spitball

229
00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:10.820
-and spit on one of them."
-Oh yeah. that was it.

230
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:15.220
I thought. it's free.

231
00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:20.780
I'd planned to take ketchup or
something with me and tip it on them.

232
00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:26.580
But I thought Dad would get mad
and ketchup costs money.

233
00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:30.820
-"No. I won't do that."
-So it was a spitball instead.

234
00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.380
Yeah. that's what it was instead.

235
00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:51.620
What's wrong with me?
Am I really that ugly?

236
00:21:54.740 --> 00:22:01.220
They'll see I'm a fantastic
and beautiful person.

237
00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:04.580
That's what I want them to see.

238
00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:31.100
Now we'll do our own catwalk
and it will be fairly unrestricted.

239
00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:33.220
I'm cleaning out
all the wardrobes at home.

240
00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:36.020
I found lots of sheets.
They'll be our clothes.

241
00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.260
Here are lots of sheets.

242
00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:42.100
We'll put them on and make our
own creations out of this.

243
00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:43.700
Yes.

244
00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:46.180
-Okay...
-You look so sceptical.

245
00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:51.780
You have to be creative!
Everyone. take a sheet. Alex!

246
00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:55.860
It's easier to improvise
if you have something on.

247
00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:59.460
-Put a sheet on!
-Look.

248
00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.700
-I don't know.
-There!

249
00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:04.980
-Isn't that good?
-Yeah. absolutely.

250
00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:10.340
-Now I've created something.
-We look like a gospel choir.

251
00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:14.740
Check out how good he looks.
gospel guy Alex.

252
00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:20.820
-You look like Tomas Di Leva.
-Is it a sheet for a double bed?

253
00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.660
Imagine you're in
a real fashion show.

254
00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.260
Let's do the groundwork for this.

255
00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:28.100
Three. two. one. there you go.

256
00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:06.900
Do you see who's arrived?

257
00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:11.540
-Hey! Nice to see you.
-You too!

258
00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:20.340
Our catwalk is becoming
more like an art installation.

259
00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:24.820
We've chosen to start the catwalk

260
00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.260
with how it was for the
developmentally handicapped in Sweden

261
00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:30.740
at the start of the 1900s.

262
00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:34.500
-Do you know how it was?
-Yes. a little.

263
00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:39.860
-It wasn't as good as it is now.
-No.

264
00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:45.620
I've brought some photos
from institutions

265
00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:50.340
that show what it looked like.

266
00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:59.460
-They're not pleasant images.
-No. they're really not.

267
00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:03.220
-No.
-It really pisses me off.

268
00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:07.540
Damn. Yuck! You just don't do that.

269
00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:10.980
Everyone is equally valuable.
I think.

270
00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:25.140
-This was pretty unpleasant to see.
-Yeah. really unpleasant.

271
00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:29.460
I recognised many of their
expressions in the pictures

272
00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:32.100
from when I was little
and went to school

273
00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:37.540
because since childhood
I've always been bullied

274
00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:41.780
just because I was different
to all the others.

275
00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:44.660
The expressions of emptiness.

276
00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:50.020
loneliness and despair.
for years. every day.

277
00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:53.300
24 hours a day.

278
00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:59.380
You shouldn't need to be behind bars
just because you're different.

279
00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:01.220
No...

280
00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:07.660
Is it unpleasant that
I show you this?

281
00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.700
A little.

282
00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:14.020
What I want is for us to make
a statement where we say

283
00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:19.540
that this isn't okay. In many other
countries it's still like this.

284
00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:25.300
That's how the catwalk will begin.
Frida has something with her.

285
00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:29.460
This is a straitjacket.

286
00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:34.580
The catwalk will start
with Ida standing...

287
00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:37.300
I'll be wearing that.

288
00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:43.860
I'll show the world that I'm free!
We will overcome all the shit.

289
00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:58.820
This won't be a regular catwalk.
but an art installation that touches.

290
00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:05.140
engages. and will be long-wearing.
It will be like a kick in the gut.

291
00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:09.780
Everyone will consider how they want
to live their life. who is seen.

292
00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:30.340
My dream is that everyone in the
group will be an outstretched arm

293
00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:34.740
to everyone who never got
the chance to shine.

294
00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:38.900
And that...

295
00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:47.700
to shut the mouths of everyone
who bullied them

296
00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:50.180
over a long period of time.

297
00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:02.260
Why I want to take it to New York
is a combination of things.

298
00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:06.660
I'm proud that we in Sweden have come
so far with the kind of work I do.

299
00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:12.180
I also want to spread our way of
thinking. make it global.

300
00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:16.180
The hardest place in the world
to do that might be New York.

301
00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:21.380
-When were you thinking?
-Fashion Week is 6-15 September.

302
00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:25.140
-Sometime during then.
-You're choosing a week...

303
00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:29.620
-Do you think it's impossible?
-It's a very hard week.

304
00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:33.300
It's the busiest week in New York.

305
00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:35.940
Everything costs
a million dollars to rent.

306
00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:38.500
It's very late to find anything good.

307
00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:43.380
I know. That's why I came to you.
I know you're opening there.

308
00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:47.540
Have you got a venue
where we can do the catwalk?

309
00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:51.620
A traditional catwalk with audience.
photographers and everything?

310
00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.500
Yes. we're doing the whole...

311
00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:59.020
We have a designer doing the clothes.
Choreographers. music. everything.

312
00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:02.060
Unfortunately it doesn't help
in your search for a venue

313
00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.380
that you have designers...

314
00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:07.300
No. I know.
We're not sparing any costs.

315
00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:13.860
We're opening in New York.
we're opening before Fashion Week.

316
00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:16.980
Or. the same week. is the idea.

317
00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:22.980
But it's a worksite. Nobody knows it
will be finished. but it's the goal.

318
00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:26.820
Give me a few weeks.
I'll see what we can do.

319
00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:52.020
Okay. gang.
We're going to walk on a catwalk.

320
00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:58.340
You'll do a joint number so we get a
feeling of team spirit going.

321
00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:03.220
We need the beats
and choreographed steps.

322
00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:08.100
Let's give it a try.
From the start.

323
00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:13.700
Let's go. Right. Left.

324
00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:16.580
Hold it. We come forward.

325
00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:20.020
Click. click. click...

326
00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:25.300
Let's do it...

327
00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:32.740
Then right. left.

328
00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:39.380
-There. How did it go?
-A bit fast. but otherwise great.

329
00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:42.580
When I stand here. I'll help out.

330
00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:47.380
I've got a head start since I
designed the steps. It's new for you.

331
00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:51.220
-But we'll let you try it yourselves.
-Okay.

332
00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:41.220
Super!

333
00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:46.340
We have to work more on the pulse
so you feel it.

334
00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:52.260
When we do something together.
we rely on the beat.

335
00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:57.620
especially if the music has
a lot of pulse. like this one will.

336
00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:03.220
-I can't do that.
-Tell me why.

337
00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:07.460
My motor skills aren't what they
should be. They're not good at all.

338
00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:15.220
The whole catwalk project and
choreography is a challenge for me.

339
00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:19.700
I'm afraid if I do something.
I might fall.

340
00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:27.700
Even when I was young.
I had bad balance and motor skills.

341
00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:34.900
I was very sick and had
a congenital heart condition.

342
00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:45.060
I was in hospital a lot. my parents
were very worried about me.

343
00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:49.300
-And those two there.
-I'm happy I'm where I am today.

344
00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:52.100
and get to do what I've dreamed of.

345
00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:58.260
It's been my biggest dream.
to do a fashion show. to dance...

346
00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:00.900
the whole thing.

347
00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:09.780
-How does the catwalk feel?
-Good.

348
00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:13.420
That one got away.

349
00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:15.300
Have you got
a girlfriend or boyfriend?

350
00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:16.900
A boyfriend.

351
00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:19.780
-A boyfriend? Who?
-Magnus Carlsson.

352
00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:21.700
Magnus Carlsson.

353
00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:24.580
Yes.

354
00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:27.140
-How did you meet?
-Yes. we have.

355
00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:30.820
-Are you together?
-Yes...

356
00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:34.500
That's good.

357
00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:39.620
-What's your favourite band?
-ABBA.

358
00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:45.380
-Can you time now? Seven minutes.
-Yes.

359
00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:48.820
Have you got an eye on it? Can you
sing something from Mamma Mia?

360
00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:52.820
-I want music.
-Which song do you know best?

361
00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:56.660
-"Mamma Mia".
-We'll try that one. then.

362
00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:03.020
-Let's see it! Choreography too?
-Yes!

363
00:34:56.740 --> 00:35:02.660
-Hillberg. how long has it been?
-There are five minutes left.

364
00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:07.140
These must be the longest
six minutes in world history.

365
00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:09.860
-Have you got your eye on the clock?
-Yes.

366
00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:11.660
There can't be five minutes left.

367
00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:13.460
It was six minutes. five minutes ago.

368
00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:15.860
-Yes. it is!
-But are you timing?

369
00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.100
Yes.

370
00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:19.940
-It's time now.
-It's time now?

371
00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:21.780
Yes.

372
00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:46.020
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

373
00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:03.140
FOUR MONTHS UNTIL THE CATWALK

374
00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:10.100
When I started working with this.
I heard all the limitations they had.

375
00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:15.860
If you always focus on the
limitations. there's no progress.

376
00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:18.980
What I've seen over all the
years we've worked.

377
00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:23.140
is that when we pose challenges.
changes happen.

378
00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:27.900
Everyone who means anything
in a context.

379
00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:31.140
and get affirmation that.
"here I am." and "I exist."

380
00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:34.740
that's when people start to grow.

381
00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:08.180
-Have you started?
-Yes.

382
00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:10.340
-Have you started watching?
-Mm.

383
00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:13.940
-You really suit glitter.
-Thank you.

384
00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:19.460
Is it you who...
You didn't bring this. did you?

385
00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:20.820
Yeah. I did.

386
00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:32.420
We want to express: Who are Emma.
Ida. Nicklas. Alex and Kitty?

387
00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:52.100
There are lots of butterflies.

388
00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:54.780
-You like that. Kitty.
-Yes.

389
00:37:56.580 --> 00:38:02.500
-What were you thinking?
-I like glitter and sequins.

390
00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:04.660
Ballerina dresses.

391
00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:30.580
With golden shoes. silver cardigan...

392
00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:34.300
White. glittery ballerina dress.

393
00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:39.380
Gold necklace. various flowers
in my hair and bracelets.

394
00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:43.540
Yes.

395
00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:48.700
-Who's finished?
-I'm finished!

396
00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:50.780
-Hillberg. are you finished?
-Finished!

397
00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:55.700
-Is this you. Nicklas?
-Yes.

398
00:38:55.780 --> 00:39:00.700
When Frida does your clothes.
what should she keep in mind?

399
00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:04.420
-ABBA.
-Yes. it's ABBA.

400
00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:06.180
-You're a bit ABBA.
-Yes.

401
00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:09.620
-What else?
-A dress.

402
00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:13.620
You're fantastic at expressing
yourself. This is all you.

403
00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:15.860
Yes.

404
00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:20.340
I feel a bit of pressure
to live up to their visions.

405
00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:24.900
Many of them want extravagance with
a train and to feel like princesses.

406
00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:27.220
I'm a bit like that too.

407
00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:31.620
-Shall we do the ballgown?
-Yes. please!

408
00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:34.780
With a lot of tulle. I like tulle.

409
00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:40.020
And a nice silk rosette at the waist.

410
00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:42.580
I'd like that on the princess dress.

411
00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:46.580
I get lots of inspiration from you
and what you like.

412
00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:49.060
Yes.

413
00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:52.660
-We'll see how I can put it together.
-Exactly. yes.

414
00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:57.620
-It's exciting.
-So exciting!

415
00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:08.020
-Would you like some cordial?
-Yes. please.

416
00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:16.580
-Look how beautiful Mum was.
-Yes. she was so beautiful.

417
00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:22.340
-How old was she in those pictures?
-That was before we met.

418
00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:25.060
She must have been around 20.

419
00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:27.700
-That's really beautiful.
-She looks like a model.

420
00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:33.460
She looks like a real model.
I asked Mum. before she died.

421
00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:36.700
"Did you never consider
being a photo model?"

422
00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:42.460
And she said.
"No. I never considered it."

423
00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:48.780
I've considered it for a long time.
I really want to be one.

424
00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:54.260
That's beautiful.
That's her friend. Barbro.

425
00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:58.260
Is that Barbro?
The one who was there at...

426
00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:02.660
-Mum's funeral.
-I didn't know that was her.

427
00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:08.500
I miss her so much. every single day.

428
00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:11.300
I miss saying "Mum".

429
00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:15.780
-I miss doing that.
-Yes...

430
00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:24.940
Imagine if I could ring Mum.

431
00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:27.780
and tell her about the catwalk.

432
00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:32.820
I'd love to do that.

433
00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:37.460
Unfortunately I can't call her.
because she's up in heaven.

434
00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:49.060
There you go. Mum.

435
00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:32.180
There... Nice.

436
00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:35.700
Really nice. Forward again.

437
00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:39.620
Great. Put your hand down.

438
00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:44.580
Great. Nice!

439
00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:48.020
Stay there. Nice.

440
00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:51.460
-Welcome!
-Thank you so much.

441
00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:56.460
You can hang your clothes over here.
Get the clothes you have with you.

442
00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:59.140
and we'll choose clothes
for the photo shoot.

443
00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:01.700
-Absolutely!
-Come!

444
00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:06.940
Great!

445
00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:12.220
If you could choose a city to take
the catwalk to. where would it be?

446
00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:16.220
I'd choose either
Stockholm or Gothenburg.

447
00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:20.100
-Gävle.
-Gävle? Okay.

448
00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:24.460
I have to tell them now.
We'll sort out a venue.

449
00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:28.820
We have to book hotels and get visas.

450
00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:33.300
I know. But they need to know
where we're going.

451
00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:38.500
Alexander. a little more this way.
Ida. come forward a little more.

452
00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:43.380
Great work. guys. So wonderful!

453
00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:47.620
Everyone.
our catwalk is going to New York!

454
00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:49.940
What?!

455
00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:52.740
-Really?
-Yep.

456
00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:01.220
I don't believe it.

457
00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:03.300
Wow!

458
00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:13.220
-I've always dreamed of New York.
-We're going to do the catwalk...

459
00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:17.540
at Fashion Week in New York.
That's when everything happens.

460
00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:21.460
-And we'll be there too.
-I always wanted to go to New York.

461
00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:23.220
-Have you?
-Yes.

462
00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:25.300
Perfect.

463
00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:27.380
There. Perfect.

464
00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:29.620
Look into the camera.

465
00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:34.020
So nice!

466
00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:37.700
-Now it's all-in '80s.
-It sure is.

467
00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:40.500
-Is that me?
-That's you.

468
00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:45.860
-How does it feel?
-Great. so fun and totally unreal.

469
00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:48.420
Perfect.

470
00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:54.180
Wow! There it is!

471
00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:01.860
THREE MONTHS UNTIL THE CATWALK

472
00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:04.500
Hey. Alex.
The catwalk is getting closer.

473
00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:09.540
<i>We're practicing proud posture.</i>
<i>Back straight and chest high.</i>

474
00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:12.740
<i>We'll put a book on your head.</i>

475
00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:17.940
<i>You can try walking around</i>
<i>keeping a straight back.</i>

476
00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:21.220
<i>You'll need it on the catwalk later.</i>

477
00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:24.580
<i>Practice. practice.</i>
<i>practice your posture. Alex.</i>

478
00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:42.660
Ugh. bloody hell...

479
00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:58.340
Five. six. seven. eight.

480
00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:02.100
One. two. three. four.
five. six. seven. eight.

481
00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:06.180
Bam. bam. stop. Bam. bam. stop.

482
00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:08.980
Snake. snake. snake.

483
00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:15.060
It's been really hard
to remember the steps to the dance.

484
00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:18.500
that we'll do on the catwalk.

485
00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:23.780
It's difficult and complicated.

486
00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:27.300
We'll do a turn as well.
Back up a bit.

487
00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:31.700
It's these turns we'll do furthest
down the catwalk.

488
00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:36.100
Put one foot out.
Then turn around.

489
00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:39.620
and then continue.
We'll walk a bit further this way.

490
00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:43.860
Foot out and turn around
to get a new focus.

491
00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:48.900
-How did it feel?
-You get a bit dizzy.

492
00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:51.220
-A bit dizzy?
-Yes.

493
00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:55.540
I get a bit dizzy and swaying.

494
00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:59.620
-It's not dangerous to get dizzy.
-I'm just afraid of...

495
00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:05.940
my epilepsy... And the fear of
having a seizure is there as well.

496
00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:11.780
I have a fear of that as well.

497
00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:14.380
Now we have the opportunity
to create new associations

498
00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:16.740
around spins and turns.

499
00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:20.260
So after the catwalk they'll
be your favourite thing.

500
00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:24.340
-My favourite things. okay.
-Well done. Emma.

501
00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:27.220
Here comes
another part of the catwalk.

502
00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:29.140
This applies to you. Kitty.

503
00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:32.100
You're going to do something else.
not just walk.

504
00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:34.700
Annika. what's she going to do?

505
00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:38.100
-You're going to sing.
-Okay!

506
00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:42.980
It's a song called "Silhouettes".
an Avicii song.

507
00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:46.900
It'll be a calm version. You'll enter
in your glittery costume.

508
00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:51.220
and stand there in the middle and
sing. Have you sung in English?

509
00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:53.620
Just once. it was pretty average.

510
00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:58.900
-We'll meet later and go through it.
-Thank you.

511
00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:04.980
Good. We've got a bit to practice.
You can go through the steps.

512
00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:08.260
so we have some working
material to go from.

513
00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:10.820
I didn't really follow that.

514
00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:16.660
You can practice this. Repetition
will help us eventually remember

515
00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:19.300
so that it sits in your body.

516
00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:32.020
Come on people.
we have all seen...

517
00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:35.460
"All." It means <i>"alla".</i>
We have all...

518
00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:39.620
And then all the way back
to the centre.

519
00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:46.500
And forward. Good!

520
00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:49.780
-How did the spin feel?
-A bit dizzy.

521
00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:52.180
-A bit dizzy?
-Yes.

522
00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:53.860
Come with me.

523
00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:59.380
Stretch out. pick an apple here.
an apple there.

524
00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:03.060
Pick an apple there.
and pick an apple there.

525
00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:08.340
Come back to the centre.
Then turn around. Good.

526
00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:13.780
-Do you know what you just did?
-Yes. That.

527
00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:17.540
-You did a spin.
-A spin. Wow!

528
00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:25.700
You did a spin by picking apples.

529
00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:28.340
What you actually did. was to...

530
00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:34.180
You do the same thing.
but you're not thinking about it.

531
00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:38.340
Oh yeah. I wasn't think about it.

532
00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:10.820
I think I'm a bit nervous.

533
00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:15.380
especially when it comes to
singing the song

534
00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:19.060
in that it's the very first time
I'm doing it.

535
00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:25.940
In a country and city I've never been
to and can't even speak the language.

536
00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:40.740
Why it's so important to me
to be seen

537
00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:45.540
isn't because I think I'm special.

538
00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:49.380
I want to convey
what I'm like as a person.

539
00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:56.380
so that others who think there's
a problem with disabled people...

540
00:51:56.460 --> 00:52:02.180
To show them we're not less valuable.

541
00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:06.500
Okay. maybe we're different. yes.

542
00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:09.860
I admit. I have a pair of
makeup sunglasses that I made

543
00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:16.020
that I've worn in town. yes.
I dress in a mix of styles.

544
00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:20.180
that might not always fit together.
But that's who I am.

545
00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:24.100
and I'm not ashamed to be different.

546
00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:30.180
I found out that certain kids
here in town

547
00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:35.220
think I'm retarded. deformed.
dumb. and stupid.

548
00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:38.420
Many think that about us.

549
00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:43.220
but we'll change that.
here and now and on the catwalk.

550
00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:57.260
Since we saw each other last.
I've thought and sketched

551
00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:59.140
and considered your sketches

552
00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:03.380
and who you are and I've tried to
interpret that in my design.

553
00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:09.060
Here. we have glitter.
So you can be glitter deluxe.

554
00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:11.460
Oh. beautiful!

555
00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:17.780
Then there's the wedding dress:
a white lace. glitter flowers.

556
00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:20.660
-Dramatic train.
-It's beautiful.

557
00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:24.580
-Do you think it'll be good?
-Yes. I think so.

558
00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:26.860
-It'll do?
-Yeah. it'll do.

559
00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:34.060
-Are you prepared?
-No. but let's do it.

560
00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:42.020
I'm thinking a real butterfly dream.
since you're the butterfly woman.

561
00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:43.300
Yes.

562
00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:47.060
You've got butterflies everywhere.
It's so lovely.

563
00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:52.260
The butterfly really represents
freedom and breaking free.

564
00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:54.820
Then there's one more.

565
00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:59.780
We have more glitter.
Do you think it will be good?

566
00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:06.180
Yes. It would be nice
to add more butterflies.

567
00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:09.300
-On this one too?
-Yes. exactly. If it's possible.

568
00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:15.220
In this one. there will be
masses of butterflies and flowers.

569
00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:21.060
In this one there's more focus on the
glitter and the skirt and movement.

570
00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:25.940
It's fun when you make two creations
that they're a bit different.

571
00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:30.180
-Do you mean I get two collections?
-Oh. yes.

572
00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:34.260
First. you'll come out in that one.
than you go backstage.

573
00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:36.900
and change into this one.
so you'll have both.

574
00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:40.340
-You're joking?
-No. Oh my god!

575
00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:49.140
-You scared me! Are you that happy?
-Yes!

576
00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:56.340
Come here.
That makes me so happy.

577
00:54:57.620 --> 00:55:01.060
-I'm crying tears of happiness.
-Me too.

578
00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:06.820
Sorry.

579
00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:18.980
-You're so lovely.
-Thank you. so are you.

580
00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:23.300
I really wish you ere my real sister.

581
00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:25.860
How sweet!

582
00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:30.740
She has so much love.

583
00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:35.620
Nobody should ever be mean
to such a lovely person.

584
00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:38.980
God...

585
00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:42.740
She's totally fantastic.

586
00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:54.900
ONE MONTH UNTIL THE CATWALK

587
00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:57.300
We have to think.

588
00:55:57.380 --> 00:56:01.900
What's the first impression we want
to give the public when they arrive?

589
00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:03.820
I'd like to give...

590
00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:07.260
What atmosphere
do you want to create?

591
00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:14.140
I want to create the atmosphere that
I. as a person. am very unsure. shy.

592
00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:20.900
timid. and happily pulls away.
So I'm thinking this shy.

593
00:56:20.980 --> 00:56:25.220
and unsure feeling.
And I'm so...

594
00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:30.980
I find strength and power.
"Here I am."

595
00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:38.420
"You don't ignore me. I'm here and
want to give you joy. Accept it now."

596
00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:42.820
That will make it even more powerful.
that there's an intention.

597
00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:47.220
It will be like a liberation.
Let's go with that.

598
00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:58.260
<i>Hello. Pär.</i>
<i>Jane Broman from Fotografiska.</i>

599
00:56:58.340 --> 00:57:03.940
<i>I'm in New York and looking at the</i>
<i>building. Everything is very delayed.</i>

600
00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:07.980
<i>It's chaos.</i>
<i>it's just a huge construction site.</i>

601
00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:10.020
<i>You'll have to find a venue</i>
<i>some other way.</i>

602
00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:14.340
<i>This won't work. unfortunately.</i>
<i>Good luck. Pär.</i>

603
00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:41.060
-New York!
-You've made it so nice.

604
00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:44.420
Thanks so much.

605
00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:48.020
-Yeah. wow...
-Nice!

606
00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:51.300
So nice. Nicklas.

607
00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:55.300
It'll be so much fun
to go to New York.

608
00:57:55.380 --> 00:58:00.340
-I don't believe it.
-Me neither. I don't either.

609
00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:13.700
We've booked flights and hotels.
Everything is ready.

610
00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:16.820
The problem is the venue. but
we're working day-round on it.

611
00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:19.460
It's the 14th of September.

612
00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:22.260
-Now?
-Yes.

613
00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:26.100
Oh!

614
00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:29.420
We have a dream

615
00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:33.860
to make the catwalk at Fashion
Week in New York in September.

616
00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:37.540
<i>September is less than</i>
<i>one month away.</i>

617
00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:40.580
Because it's the Fashion Week.

618
00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:44.060
Pär set the stakes high when he said

619
00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:46.620
we're going to New York
and that it's all sorted.

620
00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:50.180
-It wasn't all sorted.
-The venue isn't sorted.

621
00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:52.180
-Are you joking?
-No. it's true.

622
00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:55.300
And that's a concern.

623
00:58:55.380 --> 00:59:01.700
I have promised all the people in the
project to go to New York this week.

624
00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:04.740
So I cannot say no now.

625
00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:09.860
Do you have any advice
where we can be to have the catwalk?

626
00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:12.580
<i>No. unfortunately I don't.</i>

627
00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:21.060
We need a location in Manhattan.

628
00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:24.660
and we need a place
for 200-300 people.

629
00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:28.820
<i>It's really soon. and there's a</i>
<i>lot of stuff happening right now.</i>

630
00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:33.780
<i>I mean just to be upfront.</i>
<i>it might be really expensive.</i>

631
00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:55.860
I didn't think the challenge of
a venue would be so extreme.

632
00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:58.100
But now it is.

633
00:59:58.180 --> 01:00:01.940
We've searched like mad.
but we can't find one.

634
01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:09.860
We've looked at 30-40 different
places but nothing has worked.

635
01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:13.780
The situation is getting a bit dicey.

636
01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:19.780
Time is running out.
there are one and a half weeks left.

637
01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:27.300
We've had contact with a woman
who might have a solution.

638
01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:33.420
Hi. Sofia. This is Pär Johansson
from Sweden.

639
01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:35.300
<i>Hello. how are you?</i>

640
01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:39.540
I'm not so good at English but I
hope you're gonna help me. so...

641
01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:42.420
<i>Yeah. I will help you.</i>

642
01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:45.740
<i>We have two floors. we have a</i>
<i>showroom upstairs.</i>

643
01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:50.260
<i>and a big ballroom downstairs</i>
<i>where the show actually takes place.</i>

644
01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:52.500
<i>We also have a VIP press lounge</i>

645
01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:56.820
<i>which of course everyone in your</i>
<i>team will have access to.</i>

646
01:00:56.900 --> 01:01:02.580
I must open the window here.
because this is such good news.

647
01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:08.820
<i>-Oh. thank you!</i>
-I don't believe it. but...

648
01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:13.460
-If you say it's true. I believe you!
<i>-Oh. no. it's true!</i>

649
01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:15.300
This is my best phone call ever.

650
01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:19.140
<i>Oh. thank you!</i>
<i>It's a pleasure speaking with you.</i>

651
01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:22.900
-Same to you. Bye.
<i>-Bye. bye.</i>

652
01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:39.140
Wow!

653
01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:46.500
This is a studio where
you can do lots of different things.

654
01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:50.740
You can make it into almost anything.
It fits more people.

655
01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:54.740
and has more room to do
what we're going to do.

656
01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:57.300
Since we're rehearsing now
and this is the last week.

657
01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.460
we have to do a proper catwalk.

658
01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:03.020
One. two. three. four...

659
01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:05.460
ONE WEEK UNTIL THE CATWALK

660
01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:15.220
I'm going to put Swarovski crystals
in these flowers.

661
01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:18.460
You'll glitter like nothing else...

662
01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:23.140
You're totally magical!

663
01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:38.820
You're getting all...

664
01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:04.380
-What are you picking?
-I've decided I'm picking stars.

665
01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:07.380
Stars. okay.

666
01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:14.100
-Which star will you take first?
-Mum's star in heaven.

667
01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:18.740
It's called Solveig.
because Mum's name was Solveig.

668
01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:38.260
We'll gather here. everyone!

669
01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:41.700
It's the last day. and we're going to
do a dress rehearsal.

670
01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:46.820
It's new for everyone. The clothes
and movements are new for you.

671
01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:51.940
It's new to all the dressers here.
So we've decided

672
01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:56.980
that we'll do number one. two.
three and four until lunch.

673
01:03:57.060 --> 01:04:02.900
Everyone will do their own change
and practice getting into the rhythm.

674
01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:07.020
Yes. so we're waiting for Kitty.

675
01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:14.580
How did you get here?

676
01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:20.260
Since I can't sit without my back
almost folding up...

677
01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:24.180
-I walked here.
-You walked here with crutches?

678
01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:27.620
It was either that or lay in bed
at home.

679
01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:29.860
We're doing a run through
with the clothes.

680
01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:33.460
But how do you feel? Is it serious?

681
01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:37.460
I feel like I have so much to learn.

682
01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:43.300
-Try walking and see how it feels.
-So I can join in if it gets better.

683
01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:44.260
Absolutely.

684
01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:46.180
That's why I want to
be here and try.

685
01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:50.340
-You're great. Take your time.
-Okay.

686
01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:52.580
It's nothing to be sorry for.

687
01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:58.740
Now we're rehearsing for real.
We're in New York now.

688
01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:24.180
We seem ready! Let's do the first run
through of the catwalk. Off you go!

689
01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:42.740
Good. Ida!

690
01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:50.740
I feel really sorry for Kitty.
that she's got such bad back pain.

691
01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:54.580
I really feel bad looking at her.

692
01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:57.380
Good! That's great!

693
01:05:57.460 --> 01:06:01.300
I feel really worried.

694
01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:08.340
What happens to the catwalk if Kitty
can't come with us to New York?

695
01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:14.580
Really well done. everyone!

696
01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:19.700
Go home. satisfied with your work.
You've been insanely good.

697
01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:22.300
Soon. we're flying to New York.
We're doing this!

698
01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:24.420
Yes!

699
01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:31.940
-I'll fan you a bit.
-Oh. how nice!

700
01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:36.340
-There.
-That's better.

701
01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:43.940
What if I can't do that?

702
01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:47.540
I'm the one leading you.
I go first.

703
01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:50.420
-It would be chaos.
-It would be.

704
01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:53.220
-No. it's easy for me.
-It's easy for you?

705
01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:56.340
Yes.

706
01:06:59.060 --> 01:07:02.260
-You never make mistakes?
-No.

707
01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:09.260
I'm afraid there will be gangsters
coming up to us

708
01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:14.020
if we walk alone in New York.

709
01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:18.180
I have a lot of fear.

710
01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:20.820
People are usually stressed
in New York.

711
01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:26.580
They usually run.
they walk quickly.

712
01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:32.500
I walk fast.
so that I can't see my shoes.

713
01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:38.100
So sometimes my shoelaces
are undone and I trip on them.

714
01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:43.460
So I might embarrass myself there.
and when I dance with you.

715
01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:50.980
Or something.
I think he's asleep now.

716
01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:56.420
I feel very excited
and really want to show everyone

717
01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:59.220
who has unkind preconceptions of us

718
01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:02.940
that we'll damn well show them
that they're wrong.

719
01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:10.100
God. I'm so pumped.
This is going to be so much fun!

720
01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:43.620
-Has everyone got their passports?
-Yes!

721
01:08:56.100 --> 01:09:00.260
-Is this your first time in the USA?
-Yes. it is.

722
01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:02.380
I'm so excited!

723
01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:39.700
-I can't believe this is New York.
-Me neither.

724
01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:45.300
I still don't believe it.
Are we really in New York?

725
01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:50.180
Should we try to take a picture
with this beautiful background?

726
01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:53.700
Yes. let's.

727
01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:56.740
Excuse me.
can you take a picture of us?

728
01:10:58.260 --> 01:11:04.020
We have to stand together. Ida. come
forward here. Jump down here. Ida.

729
01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:08.780
-It's beautiful.
-Thank you!

730
01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:14.780
Are you a model?
You are so tall and thin.

731
01:11:14.860 --> 01:11:19.220
-So nice of you. No. I'm not a model.
-Okay. You're very beautiful.

732
01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:21.260
Thank you! You are too.
Have a nice day.

733
01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:23.900
Have a nice day too!

734
01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:28.940
-Did she look like a model?
-Yes. very much.

735
01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:45.940
Have you got a question?
Just a minute.

736
01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:48.180
What were you going to ask?

737
01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:51.060
Are you nervous to walk the
catwalk on Saturday?

738
01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:52.820
Yes.

739
01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:59.220
I'm a little nervous when I go on
the catwalk in Saturday.

740
01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:02.260
But I think...

741
01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:07.060
Yeah! This is very fun!
And it is so great.

742
01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:11.940
What are your personal icons.
personal inspiration?

743
01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:15.460
We're talking about fashion.
so what can you guys share?

744
01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:19.780
I love the '80s very much.

745
01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:24.660
Dolce & Gabbana and Gucci.

746
01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:31.700
Yeah! I love it very much.
One second. please.

747
01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:35.220
Why are you doing the catwalk?
What's the purpose?

748
01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:40.380
We're doing it because we want
to show the world

749
01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:47.060
that we're just as unique and good
in our own ways

750
01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:49.860
despite our disabilities.

751
01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:54.220
We also want to try to create
joy and happiness

752
01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:56.900
for those who don't get to
experience this.

753
01:12:56.980 --> 01:13:03.940
Give them hope that they can achieve
great dreams they carry with them.

754
01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:09.140
If you have a great dream you've
dreamed since you were little.

755
01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:12.740
I think you should...

756
01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:17.700
realise it. quite simply.
through contacting...

757
01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:21.540
-Me.
-Yeah. you or someone else.

758
01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:36.380
Tiffany & Company. And Gucci.

759
01:13:36.460 --> 01:13:40.780
-Dolce & Gabbana!
-Look at those sunglasses!

760
01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:42.340
Yeah.

761
01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:55.060
I love this jacket. It costs...

762
01:13:55.140 --> 01:14:00.100
-This one is $848.
-Okay...

763
01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:04.780
I have trouble with money
and it's value.

764
01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:08.300
-It's a hundred-something. right?
-If you think...

765
01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:14.660
-Almost 700.000 for a jacket.
-Almost 700.000 for a jacket.

766
01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:18.380
Mine cost a thousand-something
as well. I think.

767
01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:20.260
So add a zero.

768
01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:23.940
One more zero.
Yes. then it's a thousand.

769
01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:26.420
That's expensive.

770
01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:29.700
I'd like one of these.

771
01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:32.660
Me too. I wish I had it.

772
01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:35.780
Thank you. Thank you!

773
01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:31.700
-They were so good!
-Yeah. really good.

774
01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:35.140
-They guys were good.
-The guys.

775
01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:37.940
-They were better.
-You thought they were better?

776
01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:42.580
-They showed their underpants!
-Underpants!

777
01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:45.540
Yes. that's better!

778
01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:49.700
What a cheer from Nicklas
when the guys came in.

779
01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:52.100
Yes!

780
01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:58.580
-Lucky they weren't naked.
-Yeah. thank god!

781
01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:03.780
I probably would have fainted.

782
01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:08.340
-Not over there. over here!
-Come on. Nicklas.

783
01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:10.820
Come on. Nicklas!

784
01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:23.140
Do you remember
when I visited you in Gislaved?

785
01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:25.780
Yes. I remember that.

786
01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:26.820
Now we're here.

787
01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:30.020
Yes. now we're here.
It's totally unbelievable.

788
01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:34.580
I've actually noticed
how I've developed.

789
01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:40.020
I've become more self-assured
and more confident in some way.

790
01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:45.140
I've matured a lot. I think.

791
01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:52.020
I feel much happier now
than what I did before.

792
01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:55.380
-Look at this.
-I see.

793
01:16:55.460 --> 01:17:00.260
-The whole world will look at you.
-The whole world will look at me.

794
01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:05.140
It's completely unbelievable.

795
01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:07.380
Pär...

796
01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:10.660
Tomorrow. this town is ours.

797
01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:26.700
THREE HOURS UNTIL THE CATWALK

798
01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:37.060
I think a marking has ended up in the
wrong place. or we've measured wrong.

799
01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:54.700
-Hello!
-Hey!

800
01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:58.180
It's going to be so much fun!

801
01:17:58.260 --> 01:18:02.580
I thought we'd gather.
Put down your things.

802
01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:06.100
-Here we are.
-Yes. here we are.

803
01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:11.380
-Do you see where we're standing?
-Yeah. on our catwalk!

804
01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:17.140
I thought we'd go through
where our markings are.

805
01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:19.940
-Markings?
-Come and look.

806
01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:22.820
-Here. You stand there. Emma.
-What did you say?

807
01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:26.660
Stand on that line. That's where
you stand when you make an entrance.

808
01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:28.100
Entrance. okay.

809
01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:31.220
-You stand there too. Hillberg.
-I know.

810
01:18:31.300 --> 01:18:35.660
One more thing.
Here. when you turn.

811
01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:38.300
you walk out toward this edge.

812
01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:41.340
And when you turn again.
you stand like this.

813
01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:47.780
Is it the wedding dress. is it there
we walk to? I don't understand.

814
01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:49.860
Wait. Emma.
Just like you did in Hudik.

815
01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:53.780
-Yes.
-There was a cross in Hudik.

816
01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:59.300
-Now they're lines.
-I don't really understand.

817
01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:02.740
Wait.
You'll understand it really well.

818
01:19:02.820 --> 01:19:07.700
It's very structured.
you can relax.

819
01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:11.860
Put on your dressing gown
and we'll get started.

820
01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:21.380
It's hard and complicated.

821
01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:27.380
If it goes wrong.
I'm worried and afraid

822
01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:32.820
that the audience
will think we're weird

823
01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:36.300
because we can't do it.

824
01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:41.940
That we're stupid and bad.

825
01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:48.380
Shall I walk along the edge
or do a U?

826
01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:52.980
-I don't believe I can do it.
-You can.

827
01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:56.980
Pär says one thing. and lots
of other people say another thing.

828
01:19:57.060 --> 01:20:00.860
-So I get mixed up in my head.
-I understand.

829
01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:03.820
Annika. Sanna and I. we trust you.

830
01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:09.140
We know... We've been with you for
awhile now. and you're professional.

831
01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:13.460
You don't need to be worried.
You'll own the room tonight.

832
01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:15.940
People will fall off their chairs.

833
01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:21.140
I have pain in my tailbone and have
no crutches to relieve my back.

834
01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:24.740
Lean on me. That's great.

835
01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:29.460
Now we'll get one of Kitty's
crutches. Here!

836
01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:33.700
-Look. Alex.
-Thank you.

837
01:20:35.060 --> 01:20:39.940
I'm a bit worried about the pain.

838
01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:45.220
that I'm dealing with at the moment
and have for some time now.

839
01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:48.180
But I'm not going to let it stop me.

840
01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:53.340
Hey. guys. Gather on the stage
at half past. in 15 minutes.

841
01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:58.820
I feel excited and nervous.

842
01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:01.540
A bit anxious.

843
01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:05.940
But I also think that
I'll just be myself

844
01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:09.700
take it easy and have fun.

845
01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:17.540
I'm normal. This is how I look.

846
01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:20.260
And nobody can change that.

847
01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:47.780
Places. everyone!

848
01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:13.220
Let's go.

849
01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:46.340
Not long ago.

850
01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:52.980
disabled people like me were
hidden away in big institutions.

851
01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:59.420
Parents were often advised
to give us away...

852
01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:03.460
and forget we were born.

853
01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:10.180
This is still the case
in some countries today.

854
01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:18.380
We want this to change.
that's why we are here today.

855
01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:25.220
I never apologise for who I am.

856
01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:29.300
I am proud and I want respect.

857
01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:36.900
Things have moved on
and now it's time to shine.

858
01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:51.860
Bravo!

859
01:25:52.980 --> 01:25:55.060
That was flawless!

860
01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:04.740
-Quickly now.
-Let's go!

861
01:28:56.580 --> 01:29:03.140
If Mum could see me. she'd think.
"My little girl. wow!

862
01:29:03.220 --> 01:29:06.180
She has talent.

863
01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:12.980
She looks like a real photo model
from Vogue magazine."

864
01:29:13.060 --> 01:29:15.940
-It went wonderfully!
-Yes!

865
01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:18.740
I love this job!

866
01:29:36.100 --> 01:29:42.100
Dear friends. honoured guests.
the one and only Emma Örtlund!

867
01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:55.860
I am so happy.

868
01:29:55.940 --> 01:30:01.300
And I think it's very fun
that I'm here today.

869
01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:03.780
And Janne...

870
01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:10.580
There are two princesses
here in New York today!

871
01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:24.260
Every time I work with Emma.
I feel free. I feel happiness.

872
01:30:24.340 --> 01:30:26.340
How come?

873
01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:38.500
I can not explain it...

874
01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:45.700
Give the next question to her.

875
01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:52.340
We are beautiful and Down's
Syndrome are beautiful.

876
01:30:52.420 --> 01:30:58.500
It's time for them to shine too.
I think.

877
01:31:00.980 --> 01:31:05.940
Thank you so much!
You're very beautiful people!

878
01:31:15.620 --> 01:31:20.740
-How did that feel?
-It was totally magical.

879
01:31:22.020 --> 01:31:25.700
And absolutely. absolutely wonderful.

880
01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:29.860
-What will you do now?
-Now we'll go and shop!

881
01:31:33.220 --> 01:31:39.540
Look! I'm in Amelia. on the cover!

882
01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:44.660
And I'm inside the magazine!
I'm a model!

883
01:31:56.420 --> 01:32:00.500
Do you know how to get
the wood upstairs?

884
01:32:00.580 --> 01:32:04.020
You burn it up!

885
01:32:18.420 --> 01:32:21.060
-Hillberg!
-Yes.

886
01:32:22.020 --> 01:32:24.740
-Wake up!
-I am awake.

887
01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:28.340
-No. you're asleep.
-No!

888
01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:31.940
-Shut up. Pär.
-"Shut up. Pär"?!

889
01:32:33.860 --> 01:32:36.860
