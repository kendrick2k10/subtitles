00:03:07.875 --> 00:03:09.041
Sorry.

4
00:03:10.666 --> 00:03:12.250
Why's he dancing like a girl?

5
00:03:15.708 --> 00:03:17.541
<i>Sometimes I close my eyes</i>

6
00:03:17.625 --> 00:03:20.125
<i>and imagine myself on a big stage.</i>

7
00:03:34.833 --> 00:03:38.291
<i>I was 5 years old
when I discovered ballet.</i>

8
00:03:44.083 --> 00:03:46.458
<i>Ballet is not accepted in Nigeria.</i>

9
00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.333
<i>People think that it's not for boys.</i>

10
00:03:50.416 --> 00:03:52.000
Take it easy. slow down.

11
00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:55.166
<i>But I don't listen to them.</i>

12
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.333
<i>I just keep dancing.</i>

13
00:04:06.166 --> 00:04:08.833
<i>It's my dream. and I have to follow it.</i>

14
00:05:03.333 --> 00:05:06.166
- How long will you stay?
- I don't know.

15
00:05:30.916 --> 00:05:33.208
My baby. calm down.

16
00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:36.375
Calm down. we will make it.

17
00:05:36.458 --> 00:05:38.958
My hand is shaking. open it fast.

18
00:05:40.666 --> 00:05:42.208
Is it there? Is it there?

19
00:05:44.083 --> 00:05:46.666
That's it! That's it. that's it!

20
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.333
Hey! Thank God!

21
00:05:50.541 --> 00:05:52.458
Are those my eyebrows? They look funny.

22
00:05:52.541 --> 00:05:54.333
Look. see how beautiful your smile is.

23
00:05:54.416 --> 00:05:57.041
Fat. I'm fat oh.

24
00:05:58.333 --> 00:06:00.250
You have full cheeks.

25
00:06:00.333 --> 00:06:03.250
- And I like that.
- The Child Student.

26
00:06:04.291 --> 00:06:08.291
Child Student. Madu Mmesoma Anthony.

27
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.166
Chisom will miss you too much.

28
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.541
Your brother is going to miss you.

29
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:21.666
Wow.

30
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.500
We gather in the name of the Father.
Son. and of the Holy Spirit.

31
00:06:40.791 --> 00:06:42.458
Blessed Redeemer. we thank you.

32
00:06:42.541 --> 00:06:45.208
We worship you. We glorify your name.

33
00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:47.708
Father. we are here to thank you more

34
00:06:47.791 --> 00:06:49.833
for what you have done for us.

35
00:06:49.916 --> 00:06:52.375
You surprise us with good news.

36
00:06:53.083 --> 00:06:54.291
May your holy name be honored.

37
00:06:54.375 --> 00:06:56.541
May your holy name be glorified.

38
00:06:56.625 --> 00:06:59.833
May your holy name be praised...
in the name of Jesus Christ.

39
00:07:00.875 --> 00:07:04.250
Thank God
for everything He has done.

40
00:07:24.833 --> 00:07:27.166
<i>One day my son started dancing.</i>

41
00:07:29.041 --> 00:07:34.041
<i>I thought it was maybe
a kind of hobby. of no benefit.</i>

42
00:07:37.083 --> 00:07:39.666
<i>But as time goes on.</i>

43
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:42.375
<i>I started thinking that in this thing</i>

44
00:07:42.458 --> 00:07:47.250
is something that one has
to embrace. accept. appreciate.

45
00:07:50.291 --> 00:07:54.875
<i>Unfortunately. the place
they were training was not safe.</i>

46
00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.375
<i>It's in a dangerous place.</i>

47
00:07:58.708 --> 00:08:01.291
<i>We decided to withdraw him.</i>

48
00:08:01.375 --> 00:08:03.958
<i>And I'm grateful God has given him</i>

49
00:08:04.041 --> 00:08:06.541
<i>the opportunity to be there.</i>

50
00:08:33.083 --> 00:08:34.208
Seriously?

51
00:08:45.333 --> 00:08:48.416
Chisom. What happened?

52
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.375
You haven't been talking to me.

53
00:09:20.375 --> 00:09:22.583
<i>I feel for the younger one.</i>

54
00:09:22.666 --> 00:09:24.750
'cause they are just like twins.

55
00:09:24.833 --> 00:09:26.375
They are always together.

56
00:09:26.458 --> 00:09:29.041
Now that he's going.
I don't know how he will feel.

57
00:09:31.083 --> 00:09:32.625
I'm happy that he's traveling.

58
00:09:32.708 --> 00:09:37.500
but also. I'm having feelings
for the younger one.

59
00:10:48.375 --> 00:10:52.333
I can't believe that I'm going
to be schooling in England

60
00:10:52.416 --> 00:10:54.166
for seven years.

61
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.041
It's a great opportunity.

62
00:10:59.708 --> 00:11:02.875
These are my winter caps. as they say.

63
00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:10.041
<i>I'm actually happy to leave this school</i>

64
00:11:10.125 --> 00:11:13.958
<i>because of the bullying and everything.</i>

65
00:11:14.041 --> 00:11:15.833
<i>At least it's going to stop.</i>

66
00:11:17.833 --> 00:11:19.875
My mom is going to miss me the most.

67
00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.250
I'm very. very close to her.

68
00:11:25.125 --> 00:11:27.291
We always talk together.

69
00:11:27.375 --> 00:11:29.541
And also my brother.

70
00:11:29.625 --> 00:11:32.958
Always... sometimes we have issues.

71
00:11:33.041 --> 00:11:37.458
but sometimes. we do talk
to each other. so...

72
00:11:42.791 --> 00:11:44.166
The tire is gone.

73
00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:46.875
If you have just small money.
change the tire.

74
00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.750
If money comes. I will do it.

75
00:11:50.375 --> 00:11:53.916
If there's money. I'm supposed
to change this machine.

76
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.125
But there's no money.

77
00:11:56.208 --> 00:11:57.875
How are your children?

78
00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:01.083
- All of them are fine.
- Hope they are fine.

79
00:12:01.166 --> 00:12:04.375
- My son. he got a scholarship.
- Over there?

80
00:12:04.458 --> 00:12:07.083
- He got a scholarship abroad.
- Who will take him there?

81
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:11.833
- His God and the White man.
- The White man? Ah.

82
00:12:11.916 --> 00:12:13.875
So. it's only dance that takes him there?

83
00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:17.041
- Only dance.
- I thank God.

84
00:13:05.208 --> 00:13:06.666
<i>I dreamed that I died.</i>

85
00:13:08.541 --> 00:13:13.833
<i>I started thinking.
if I died. who will bury me?</i>

86
00:13:13.916 --> 00:13:15.916
<i>Who will take me to home?</i>

87
00:13:17.333 --> 00:13:20.875
<i>But since I have the good news of my son.</i>

88
00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:24.333
<i>if I die tomorrow.
I will die in good faith.</i>

89
00:13:26.791 --> 00:13:28.000
No more fear.

90
00:13:33.375 --> 00:13:38.791
<i>The promise I'm making
to my mom and my family is...</i>

91
00:13:39.916 --> 00:13:41.958
<i>I will never let them down.</i>

92
00:14:13.208 --> 00:14:17.416
I've seen this coming years back
when I lost my dad.

93
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.666
I prophesied that
it would come. and it came.

94
00:14:21.625 --> 00:14:26.333
And he gave me
a special dance at my father's burial.

95
00:14:26.416 --> 00:14:29.166
So. because of that. I say. "J"!

96
00:14:30.916 --> 00:14:31.916
E!

97
00:14:32.916 --> 00:14:33.916
S!

98
00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:35.958
U!

99
00:14:36.833 --> 00:14:37.833
Safe journey!

100
00:14:38.875 --> 00:14:42.458
- S!
- Jesus!

101
00:15:58.583 --> 00:16:01.333
You know that today is the last time

102
00:16:01.416 --> 00:16:03.458
we'll sit together like this?

103
00:16:03.541 --> 00:16:05.958
After now.
you start going to the airport.

104
00:16:07.166 --> 00:16:09.416
I will really miss you.

105
00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.750
But I'm happy for you. hmm?

106
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.666
I'm happy for you. my son.

107
00:16:16.041 --> 00:16:18.000
Thank you for making me proud.

108
00:16:20.166 --> 00:16:23.833
The only thing
I'm begging you is to please

109
00:16:23.916 --> 00:16:26.833
know what you go there to do. Hmm?

110
00:16:26.916 --> 00:16:30.416
Know what you go there to do.
Don't forget where you're coming from.

111
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.333
Please. don't forget
where you're coming from.

112
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.041
- I will miss you a lot.
- Me. too.

113
00:16:38.125 --> 00:16:41.458
Your siblings will miss you.
Your daddy will miss you.

114
00:16:43.166 --> 00:16:44.750
<i>- Anthony!</i>
- Ma!

115
00:16:44.833 --> 00:16:47.125
All right. let's go. It's time.

116
00:16:55.583 --> 00:16:57.541
Someone should turn off the lights.

117
00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:00.750
Make sure you lock the door very well.

118
00:17:00.833 --> 00:17:02.708
Anthony's going to the airport!

119
00:17:09.833 --> 00:17:13.125
Safe journey. yeah?
Be a good boy. yeah?

120
00:17:16.166 --> 00:17:18.250
Remember your mother. please.

121
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.291
My baby.

122
00:17:26.875 --> 00:17:30.625
I will miss you. I'll miss you. my boy.

123
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.333
You've not lost him.

124
00:17:56.958 --> 00:18:00.083
He's not missing. he's just traveling.

125
00:18:00.166 --> 00:18:03.250
Don't worry.
Once he lands. he will call you.

126
00:18:59.208 --> 00:19:01.958
Are you missing your brother?

127
00:19:02.041 --> 00:19:03.458
Don't worry. yeah?

128
00:19:03.541 --> 00:19:05.708
He'll be reaching soon. They will call.

129
00:21:14.708 --> 00:21:15.833
<i>Mmesoma!</i>

130
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:17.958
Hello. Mommy. good afternoon.

131
00:21:19.125 --> 00:21:20.625
<i>- How are you?</i>
- Fine.

132
00:21:22.708 --> 00:21:25.083
<i>- You're in your school now?</i>
- Yes.

133
00:21:26.458 --> 00:21:28.083
<i>Oh. my boy!</i>

134
00:21:30.541 --> 00:21:32.000
<i>Is this your room?</i>

135
00:21:32.083 --> 00:21:35.791
- This is my bed.
- London boy! London boy!

136
00:21:35.875 --> 00:21:37.708
- And my table.
- I like your house.

137
00:21:37.791 --> 00:21:39.583
Thank you.

138
00:21:39.666 --> 00:21:42.333
<i>- Have you eaten?</i>
- Yes. Ma.

139
00:21:43.625 --> 00:21:45.958
<i>- You're okay?</i>
- Yes.

140
00:21:46.041 --> 00:21:48.250
<i>Call you later this evening.</i>

141
00:21:48.333 --> 00:21:49.750
<i>Call me. let's talk. yeah?</i>

142
00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.250
<i>- Bye-bye. my dear.</i>
- Bye-bye.

143
00:21:55.625 --> 00:21:58.500
I'm going to be living with a lot of kids

144
00:21:58.583 --> 00:22:01.166
that I've never met before.

145
00:22:04.333 --> 00:22:08.708
I'm concerned if. maybe. I may not fit in.

146
00:27:41.458 --> 00:27:44.166
<i>Some people.
they say that I'll never make it.</i>

147
00:27:45.583 --> 00:27:47.291
<i>What if they're saying the truth?</i>

148
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.041
Every time I think about the way
I've been bullied for years.

149
00:27:56.125 --> 00:27:58.708
it makes me feel very. very bad.

150
00:27:58.791 --> 00:28:02.875
And it makes me not respond to people
the way I'm supposed to.

151
00:28:04.458 --> 00:28:06.250
I just want to be alone.

152
00:28:58.208 --> 00:29:02.666
What my mind tells me
is that sometimes

153
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:04.916
just everything is going to be fine.

154
00:29:15.125 --> 00:29:16.958
<i>Hello. Mommy. good evening.</i>

155
00:29:17.041 --> 00:29:19.083
Good evening. dear. How are you?

156
00:29:19.791 --> 00:29:21.500
<i>You're feeling all right now. right?</i>

157
00:29:22.916 --> 00:29:23.958
<i>Good.</i>

158
00:29:25.208 --> 00:29:28.750
Remember our deal.
Be a good boy. okay?

159
00:29:29.458 --> 00:29:30.750
You know we have a deal?

160
00:29:31.458 --> 00:29:33.875
<i>You made a promise. right?</i>

161
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.375
<i>Always remember
where you're coming from. yeah?</i>

162
00:29:39.208 --> 00:29:42.166
<i>In the morning before stepping out.
you pray. okay?</i>

163
00:29:44.375 --> 00:29:45.833
<i>We are also praying for you here.</i>

164
00:29:49.833 --> 00:29:51.208
<i>Come and say hello to Anthony.</i>

165
00:29:57.041 --> 00:29:58.208
<i>Where are you now?</i>

166
00:30:00.291 --> 00:30:01.500
At home.

167
00:30:02.125 --> 00:30:05.083
<i>You're now speaking like a White person.</i>

168
00:30:06.416 --> 00:30:08.708
<i>You're talking with your mom. please.</i>

169
00:36:58.916 --> 00:37:02.125
<i>He was seen by a local optician.</i>

170
00:37:02.208 --> 00:37:05.916
<i>and his condition is quite longstanding.</i>

171
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.583
<i>He doesn't seem to have
very much sight at all</i>

172
00:37:08.666 --> 00:37:09.875
<i>in his right eye.</i>

173
00:37:09.958 --> 00:37:13.000
<i>so he's been referred to the NHS.</i>

174
00:37:13.083 --> 00:37:14.833
<i>to a specialist doctor.</i>

175
00:37:14.916 --> 00:37:16.958
<i>In the meantime.</i>

176
00:37:17.041 --> 00:37:19.541
<i>we have a teacher coming in. Judith.</i>

177
00:37:19.625 --> 00:37:22.875
<i>and. um. she's going to start
working with Anthony</i>

178
00:37:22.958 --> 00:37:24.791
<i>on a one-to-one basis.</i>

179
00:37:24.875 --> 00:37:28.375
<i>And we've got a mental health
nurse that he can access</i>

180
00:37:28.458 --> 00:37:30.166
<i>if he needs that.</i>

181
00:37:38.291 --> 00:37:41.500
<i>What is the problem?
What can cause those scars there?</i>

182
00:38:02.541 --> 00:38:04.750
<i>Don't worry. you'll be fine. yeah?</i>

183
00:38:13.041 --> 00:38:14.750
<i>I hope you are not afraid.</i>

184
00:38:17.666 --> 00:38:18.958
<i>Why?</i>

185
00:38:24.083 --> 00:38:25.791
<i>Are you serious?</i>

186
00:38:34.708 --> 00:38:35.833
<i>Oh. my God.</i>

187
00:38:38.125 --> 00:38:40.750
<i>Don't worry. You'll be fine. okay?</i>

188
00:38:42.333 --> 00:38:43.916
<i>There's nothing God cannot do.</i>

189
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.500
<i>God will not allow this eye</i>

190
00:38:46.583 --> 00:38:48.708
<i>to be a problem for your future.</i>

191
00:39:03.875 --> 00:39:05.416
<i>It's actually my fault.</i>

192
00:39:06.916 --> 00:39:10.875
<i>I'm really quiet when I'm sad.
I do not like talking to anyone.</i>

193
00:39:11.625 --> 00:39:15.250
<i>So. when it started.
I didn't exactly tell her.</i>

194
00:39:25.208 --> 00:39:29.458
<i>I worry because of this.
they'll send me back to Nigeria.</i>

195
00:39:59.625 --> 00:40:01.500
<i>I have to work really hard</i>

196
00:40:01.583 --> 00:40:04.791
<i>so that I'm going to be
at the same place that they are.</i>

197
00:44:49.041 --> 00:44:52.833
What is it gonna take
for me to be like you?

198
00:44:54.333 --> 00:44:57.250
Because I want to be
a principal dancer.

199
00:48:00.416 --> 00:48:02.000
<i>The way I see Anthony.</i>

200
00:48:02.083 --> 00:48:04.291
<i>I see him as a light for the family.</i>

201
00:48:06.833 --> 00:48:09.041
<i>I miss him so much that</i>

202
00:48:09.125 --> 00:48:12.250
<i>at times I'll forget that he's not here.</i>

203
00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:59.666
Good morning!

204
00:48:59.750 --> 00:49:00.958
Happy New Year.

205
00:49:34.041 --> 00:49:36.333
How did you spend your Christmas there?

206
00:49:36.416 --> 00:49:38.083
Was it fun?

207
00:49:38.166 --> 00:49:41.416
It was boring. Felt like this. but...

208
00:49:41.875 --> 00:49:43.708
<i>Shut up!</i>

209
00:49:45.041 --> 00:49:48.541
- Are you missing home?
- Yeah.

210
00:49:48.625 --> 00:49:50.541
Have you seen your eye doctor?

211
00:49:50.625 --> 00:49:52.666
<i>I think I'm going
for the second one later.</i>

212
00:49:57.083 --> 00:50:00.875
Your lips are very dry.
Do you have wet lips?

213
00:50:01.666 --> 00:50:03.791
Wear lipstick. a red one.

214
00:50:05.541 --> 00:50:07.291
What is wrong with him?

215
00:53:21.416 --> 00:53:22.416
Hey.

216
00:53:26.875 --> 00:53:29.833
Sorry. um. yeah. Hello.

217
00:53:33.416 --> 00:53:37.333
Basically. I kind of like.
wanted to say

218
00:53:37.416 --> 00:53:41.833
thank you for. you know.
being a good friend.

219
00:53:44.250 --> 00:53:47.666
You are kind of like the only real friend
I've ever had. basically.

220
00:53:49.416 --> 00:53:51.625
So. that's why
I got you these for Valentine's.

221
00:53:51.708 --> 00:53:54.208
Thank you. That's so sweet!

222
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.750
They're so pretty. thank you.

223
00:53:57.833 --> 00:54:00.750
I just saw them on the shelf.
and. like. basically. I remembered.

224
00:54:00.833 --> 00:54:02.458
Aw. thank you.

225
00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:11.083
Oh. my gosh. seriously.

226
00:54:11.166 --> 00:54:13.416
- Really nervous.
- Don't worry.

227
00:54:25.291 --> 00:54:26.291
So cold.

228
01:05:42.458 --> 01:05:44.541
Let me feed my boy.

229
01:05:51.916 --> 01:05:54.333
I don't see anyone else but you.

230
01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:36.250
You have a headache?

231
01:06:36.333 --> 01:06:38.458
No headache. it's just hot.

232
01:06:40.208 --> 01:06:43.416
- That's Nigerian weather for you.
- No. it's terrible.

233
01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.375
It's worse than I thought it would be.

234
01:06:52.083 --> 01:06:55.208
When the itching starts.
it keeps you uncomfortable. right?

235
01:06:55.291 --> 01:06:56.625
Kind of.

236
01:06:59.041 --> 01:07:00.541
Do the eyedrops help?

237
01:07:07.708 --> 01:07:11.708
I'm very sorry.
That time. I really felt bad.

238
01:07:11.791 --> 01:07:12.833
It's fine.

239
01:07:13.416 --> 01:07:15.958
- Hmm?
- It's fine.

240
01:07:21.041 --> 01:07:22.875
Please. when you go back.

241
01:07:22.958 --> 01:07:25.541
try to be applying it always. okay?

242
01:07:25.625 --> 01:07:28.416
I'll keep reminding you.

243
01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:31.083
I'll keep reminding you of that. yeah?

244
01:07:47.625 --> 01:07:50.583
Can you come
and train with me on the field?

245
01:07:51.875 --> 01:07:55.833
- You must come.
- No. not today.

246
01:07:55.916 --> 01:07:57.666
Today. you must come.

247
01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:58.750
No.

248
01:08:00.375 --> 01:08:01.375
Why?

249
01:08:03.666 --> 01:08:05.041
What do you mean why?

250
01:09:35.791 --> 01:09:37.666
Before you go back to the UK.

251
01:09:37.750 --> 01:09:39.958
I want you to make peace
with your brother.

252
01:09:40.041 --> 01:09:42.958
He's just a little boy.
that you have to manage him.

253
01:09:43.041 --> 01:09:46.500
A little boy?
He's 12. for goodness' sake.

254
01:09:46.583 --> 01:09:49.166
Start talking with him now.
because I'm going inside.

255
01:09:49.250 --> 01:09:52.500
I have something to do inside.
I'm entering inside.

256
01:10:24.416 --> 01:10:27.583
This stage you are now. that's the stage.

257
01:10:28.791 --> 01:10:31.916
- That is it. you will outgrow it.
- You will control it.

258
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.125
Teenagers. it happens to them.

259
01:10:34.208 --> 01:10:36.666
Whenever you enter teenage.
once in a while.

260
01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:39.333
you just get annoyed for no reason.

261
01:10:39.416 --> 01:10:43.208
No. I need a therapist.
and I can't find anyone here.

262
01:10:43.291 --> 01:10:45.208
- You need?
- A therapist.

263
01:10:45.291 --> 01:10:48.666
- What is a therapist?
- People that help you with your problems.

264
01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:50.791
- Can't I help you?
- No.

265
01:10:52.375 --> 01:10:54.125
Don't worry. I'll take you to my prophet.

266
01:10:54.208 --> 01:10:55.625
- I do not need your prophet.
- You need him.

267
01:10:55.708 --> 01:10:57.250
I need a therapist.
not a prophet.

268
01:10:57.333 --> 01:10:59.083
- You need him.
- No. I don't!

269
01:10:59.166 --> 01:11:00.625
There's nothing God cannot do.

270
01:11:00.708 --> 01:11:03.458
I need a therapist.
not a prophet. thank you.

271
01:11:06.208 --> 01:11:08.333
I shake when I get annoyed.

272
01:11:08.416 --> 01:11:12.000
Listen. all eyes are on you now.

273
01:11:12.708 --> 01:11:14.791
Listen. do you know that this thing
is giving me much concern?

274
01:11:14.875 --> 01:11:16.416
It's also giving me concern.

275
01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:18.541
- Tony. take it easy.
- Why won't you help me?

276
01:11:18.625 --> 01:11:22.000
- I'm trying... No!
- Excuse me. take it easy.

277
01:11:22.083 --> 01:11:24.791
Finding this type of anger in you is bad.

278
01:11:24.875 --> 01:11:26.416
It's really bad.

279
01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:29.583
Well. it's bad
if I can't control it myself.

280
01:11:29.666 --> 01:11:31.083
We're trying to put you in order.

281
01:11:31.166 --> 01:11:32.458
You're trying to tell us that--

282
01:11:32.541 --> 01:11:34.833
I'm also trying to put myself in order.

283
01:11:34.916 --> 01:11:37.791
If you don't keep repeating everything
over and over again

284
01:11:37.875 --> 01:11:39.375
when I've already said it.

285
01:11:45.625 --> 01:11:48.208
- No. no.
- Come. It's your mom.

286
01:11:48.833 --> 01:11:51.041
It's me. it's fine.

287
01:11:54.875 --> 01:11:57.333
Now you're making me cry. it's fine.

288
01:13:26.125 --> 01:13:29.791
<i>My eye's going to maybe end my career.</i>

289
01:29:19.416 --> 01:29:21.541
- Is it paining you?
- It is kind of.

290
01:29:21.625 --> 01:29:24.291
It is? Sorry.

291
01:29:26.666 --> 01:29:30.000
Sorry. now. Are you a baby?

292
01:29:30.083 --> 01:29:32.166
No. it's these ones that are hurting now.

293
01:29:32.250 --> 01:29:33.916
- Is it tight?
- A bit.

294
01:29:35.791 --> 01:29:38.916
How did you learn to speak

295
01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.333
this type of British English?

296
01:29:42.416 --> 01:29:46.416
How... I just know how to do it.
I just know how to speak it.

297
01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:48.708
Like. normal.

298
01:29:48.791 --> 01:29:50.958
Do you still know how to speak Igbo?

299
01:29:51.041 --> 01:29:53.083
I never knew how to speak Igbo.

300
01:29:53.166 --> 01:29:54.916
You're not ashamed of yourself?

301
01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:58.208
- Sorry. I never knew how to speak it.
- Are you not from Igboland?

302
01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:02.291
I will teach you. Right from now.
I'll be speaking Igbo to you.

303
01:30:02.375 --> 01:30:04.666
- But you can understand it. right?
- Yeah.

304
01:31:36.750 --> 01:31:38.791
- Have you been here before?
- No.

305
01:31:40.250 --> 01:31:42.500
I come here
to play football sometimes.

306
01:31:44.208 --> 01:31:46.458
Mostly on Saturday morning.

307
01:32:22.208 --> 01:32:24.708
<i>When are you guys going back to school?</i>

308
01:32:24.791 --> 01:32:27.291
On Monday. next week.

309
01:32:27.375 --> 01:32:30.375
- Are you good at maths?
- Mmm. yeah.

310
01:32:30.458 --> 01:32:34.375
- You're not good at maths.
- I'm good at maths. but not like that.

311
01:32:34.458 --> 01:32:38.541
- How are you coping in your grades?
- Very well.

312
01:32:40.375 --> 01:32:43.333
I heard that you got zero on your exam.

313
01:32:46.291 --> 01:32:48.583
Can you jump from here?

314
01:32:48.666 --> 01:32:51.291
If you ask me that question.
I'm going to kill you.

315
01:33:25.958 --> 01:33:29.250
Father. make him
the professional ballet dancer

316
01:33:29.333 --> 01:33:30.958
that he always dreamed of.

317
01:33:31.041 --> 01:33:33.625
Please. help him to achieve his dreams

318
01:33:33.708 --> 01:33:35.500
in the mighty name of Jesus.
