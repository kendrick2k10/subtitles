00:01:07.942 --> 00:01:09.319
Tom. it's Carlos.

4
00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:10.570
Been texting you all day. man.

5
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.906
We need to pay rent and I need your share.

6
00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:14.324
Please call me back. Thanks.

7
00:01:50.902 --> 00:01:53.488
Dude. I see your room is empty.

8
00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:56.241
Why?

9
00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:57.242
Please call me back.

10
00:02:13.216 --> 00:02:14.801
- Hey. how are ya?

11
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.262
You're lookin' good.

12
00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:20.515
Put on some weight since last year. huh?

13
00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:23.017
- That was three years ago.

14
00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:25.937
I got it.

15
00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:41.119
- You remember Chloe?

16
00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:49.502
- Yeah. Went to high school together.

17
00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:52.797
- We did more than that.

18
00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:56.217
- Got your old room all set up.

19
00:02:56.217 --> 00:02:58.094
Let me show you-
- I know where it is.

20
00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:01.431
- Okay. Let's go.

21
00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:21.117
- Why don't you rest up
and we could talk later.

22
00:03:23.244 --> 00:03:24.078
- Cool.

23
00:03:25.496 --> 00:03:27.081
- And Chloe. finish that assignment

24
00:03:27.081 --> 00:03:29.167
and I'll check it out tonight.

25
00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:30.001
- Yes. sir.

26
00:03:31.085 --> 00:03:32.378
- Oh yeah. one more thing.

27
00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:34.589
Look at me.

28
00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:41.429
- What the hell was that?

29
00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:45.516
- So how long you in town for?

30
00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:49.687
- A week. maybe two.

31
00:03:49.687 --> 00:03:51.648
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

32
00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:52.899
- I work at the Rusty Tavern.

33
00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:55.485
so better stop by before you leave.

34
00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:56.611
- I will. I will.

35
00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:00.865
- You smile just like your dad.

36
00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:04.077
- I don't do a damn thing like my father.

37
00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:07.872
- You still have beef with him?

38
00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:09.916
For what?

39
00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:13.086
'Cause ya know that grudge.
that hurts you. too.

40
00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:14.045
not just him.

41
00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:18.508
- Look. all I'm sayin' is I'm
not my. I'm just not my dad.

42
00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:21.052
- Well ya can't just throw
him away like an old boot.

43
00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:24.055
He's in your blood.
whether you like it or not.

44
00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:25.348
- I'm gonna certainly try.

45
00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:30.853
- Look. I'm just saying

46
00:04:30.853 --> 00:04:33.564
to keep an open mind. amigo. that's it.

47
00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:38.695
Ya know people. they don't
hold on to bitterness

48
00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:40.029
and anger for no reason.

49
00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:42.699
Think about it.

50
00:04:43.908 --> 00:04:45.618
Hasta luego. cowboy.

51
00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.509
- So. what was it like
growing up with him. man?

52
00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:02.927
I mean. he could have gone anywhere

53
00:05:02.927 --> 00:05:04.387
and yet he chooses this farm?

54
00:05:05.763 --> 00:05:07.098
He's like a cowboy Einstein.

55
00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:08.891
I mean. you're so lucky.

56
00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:10.977
- Whatever you say. man.

57
00:05:13.354 --> 00:05:14.522
- Look right into that.

58
00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:18.693
- Serious?

59
00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:19.527
- Go ahead.

60
00:05:31.205 --> 00:05:32.540
- Nice.

61
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.375
- This is new. Can I try it out. too?

62
00:05:40.214 --> 00:05:42.300
Crown prince has arrived. After you.

63
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.760
- Look. man. I'm only
here 'cause he's promised

64
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.054
to pay me for some stupid experiment.

65
00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:48.765
You and him. way more in
common than I ever had. okay?

66
00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:55.355
- Remember the last time you were here?

67
00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:59.442
It was just a fan and a laptop.

68
00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:03.738
Look at this place now.

69
00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:10.286
MIT. Caltech. Stanford. nowhere
near what I'm doin' here.

70
00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:14.665
Why don't you explain to him what we do.

71
00:06:14.665 --> 00:06:16.876
You know what we do here. right?

72
00:06:17.752 --> 00:06:19.170
- Nope.

73
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.296
- Backup and restore.

74
00:06:21.255 --> 00:06:23.091
Okay. like. you know on a computer

75
00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:24.717
where you can backup and restore?

76
00:06:24.717 --> 00:06:27.512
- Yeah. copy the data. if you get a virus

77
00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:30.098
or somethin' like that.
you can fix the computer.

78
00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:31.933
- Only we fix brains here.

79
00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:37.480
- So. this machine right
here. it's called a Scammer.

80
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.400
It digitally scans your brain
and creates a backup. so.

81
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.110
God forbid you lose your memory.

82
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.820
we can restore it from the backup.

83
00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:46.114
- Memory loss.

84
00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:53.079
Terrible thing.

85
00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:06.217
Can you imagine looking at your child

86
00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:08.302
and not knowin' who it is?

87
00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:12.890
The horror of that?

88
00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:18.020
Worse than death.

89
00:07:20.022 --> 00:07:20.857
- To some.

90
00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:25.653
- You wanted to try this?

91
00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:28.364
- It's what I'm here for. isn't it?

92
00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:43.045
- Here. take this.

93
00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:47.592
It'll calm your brain down.

94
00:07:48.634 --> 00:07:50.344
- And it'll make recording easier.

95
00:07:58.144 --> 00:07:59.145
- Let's get started.

96
00:08:02.064 --> 00:08:03.107
- Okay. so what you're gonna-

97
00:08:03.107 --> 00:08:04.567
- Don't bother. okay. man.

98
00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:07.195
The quicker we start.
the quicker I get paid.

99
00:08:13.826 --> 00:08:16.162
- Let's get you set up here.

100
00:08:17.121 --> 00:08:19.665
Keep your head still. please.

101
00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:21.375
- You guys are sure this is safe. right?

102
00:08:21.375 --> 00:08:24.253
- Yeah. 100%.

103
00:08:24.253 --> 00:08:26.297
Okay. we're set.

104
00:09:15.137 --> 00:09:16.389
- You see this?

105
00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:20.977
This is your brain in digital form.

106
00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:35.116
- So. Dr. Davis. now
that the backup's done.

107
00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:37.159
should we show him how the restore works?

108
00:09:37.159 --> 00:09:37.994
- Not tonight.

109
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:54.302
Look. I'm gonna go over
to the Rusty Tavern.

110
00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:55.428
Why don't we get a drink?

111
00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:57.513
I'd like to talk to you about your mother.

112
00:10:03.936 --> 00:10:05.771
- Hey. Dr. Davis. I was wondering

113
00:10:05.771 --> 00:10:08.316
if I could get access to the lab again?

114
00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:09.692
- After what you did?

115
00:10:11.527 --> 00:10:12.361
Let's go.

116
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:41.724
- Good boy. Go.

117
00:10:45.561 --> 00:10:46.562
Are you ready?

118
00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.694
- I'm not sure about this. man.

119
00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.615
- You know what's in his bag. right?

120
00:11:10.419 --> 00:11:13.756
Your Highness here is
your ticket to eternity

121
00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:17.134
in three. two.

122
00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:19.595
one.

123
00:11:27.436 --> 00:11:28.729
It's okay. it's okay.

124
00:11:28.729 --> 00:11:31.107
Please sit down. sit down. Don't worry.

125
00:11:32.608 --> 00:11:35.111
It will take two hours to
back up your entire brain.

126
00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:36.612
then all we need to do
is find a younger body

127
00:11:36.612 --> 00:11:38.364
and upload your backup.

128
00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:40.991
Then it will be smooth
sailing for another 50 years.

129
00:11:42.034 --> 00:11:44.203
Whose car is that out there?

130
00:11:44.203 --> 00:11:48.165
- Dr. Davis I was not
expecting you back so soon.

131
00:11:48.165 --> 00:11:49.625
- Who the hell is this?

132
00:11:50.501 --> 00:11:51.627
- Dr. Davis. listen.

133
00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:55.548
this man is about to pay a
million dollars for the Mint.

134
00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:57.758
- You're sellin' my research?

135
00:11:57.758 --> 00:11:58.676
Get these assholes outta here.

136
00:11:58.676 --> 00:12:00.386
Get out. Let's go.
- Imagine the research

137
00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:01.220
- You gotta go.
- we could do.

138
00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.054
Let's go.

139
00:12:02.054 --> 00:12:04.014
And you. I want you off my property.

140
00:12:04.014 --> 00:12:04.849
- Out. I want you

141
00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:05.683
off my property.
- Dr. Davis.

142
00:12:05.683 --> 00:12:06.726
Dr. Davis. please listen.

143
00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:08.310
- Go!

144
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:10.771
Go. get out.

145
00:12:12.106 --> 00:12:17.111
Bruno! Bruno!

146
00:12:57.693 --> 00:12:58.569
This is the Mint.

147
00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:01.030
- Short for Memory Interpreter.

148
00:13:05.993 --> 00:13:08.788
It will
completely restore memory.

149
00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:10.706
- All right. let me see if I got this.

150
00:13:10.706 --> 00:13:13.167
Scammer records the memory
onto the little noggin

151
00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:15.503
and then the Mint plays it back.

152
00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:17.588
Okay. what are we testing?

153
00:13:17.588 --> 00:13:18.422
- The hold time.

154
00:13:20.049 --> 00:13:22.927
- The problem is it only
holds for 15 minutes.

155
00:13:22.927 --> 00:13:25.304
- What happens after 15 minutes?

156
00:13:25.304 --> 00:13:28.098
- Your brain returns to
its pre-restored state.

157
00:13:28.098 --> 00:13:28.933
- What?

158
00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:31.393
- Look.

159
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:40.402
This is your neuro structure
before restore. okay?

160
00:13:40.402 --> 00:13:45.407
Now. after you load your
backup. it changes like this.

161
00:13:48.202 --> 00:13:49.036
Right?

162
00:13:50.037 --> 00:13:53.415
But it's only gonna hold for
a limited amount of time.

163
00:13:53.415 --> 00:13:54.708
- 900 seconds.

164
00:13:54.708 --> 00:13:56.085
- Which is about 15 minutes.

165
00:13:57.545 --> 00:14:00.339
Then it's gonna go back
to its original state.

166
00:14:00.339 --> 00:14:02.842
- So. you just go back to the beginning.

167
00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:03.759
- Exactly.

168
00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:11.517
Now. what I wanna do is avoid a return

169
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.936
to that original state
for as long as possible.

170
00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:17.690
One more thing.

171
00:14:20.985 --> 00:14:25.990
I'm gonna need you to log down
everything you do on this.

172
00:14:26.073 --> 00:14:27.700
Okay?

173
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.285
- Okay.

174
00:14:35.624 --> 00:14:37.877
- Let's get you set up.

175
00:15:34.725 --> 00:15:39.730
- This is Tom Davis.
It's June 5th. 7:45 pm.

176
00:15:40.064 --> 00:15:43.025
Current hold time is three hours.

177
00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:47.071
CRUMS are 5%.

178
00:15:47.071 --> 00:15:48.614
- Dude. we did it.

179
00:15:49.448 --> 00:15:50.366
We did it. man.

180
00:15:50.366 --> 00:15:52.159
- Yeah. we did it.

181
00:15:52.159 --> 00:15:53.369
- We did shit!

182
00:15:56.789 --> 00:15:58.457
This is changing history.

183
00:16:00.167 --> 00:16:01.710
- Get out.

184
00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:02.544
- Look. I haven't-

185
00:16:02.544 --> 00:16:03.462
- Get out!

186
00:16:18.477 --> 00:16:19.687
- Hey. where's my money?

187
00:16:22.481 --> 00:16:23.899
You promised you would
pay me after two weeks.

188
00:16:23.899 --> 00:16:25.317
- Yeah. not for a shit result.

189
00:16:25.317 --> 00:16:26.777
- That's not my problem. now is it?

190
00:16:26.777 --> 00:16:28.278
Okay. I came and helped.

191
00:16:28.278 --> 00:16:29.571
You said you would pay.

192
00:16:29.571 --> 00:16:32.866
- It's all about the goddamn
money with you. ain't it?

193
00:16:32.866 --> 00:16:34.660
- I mean. unlike you. okay.
I live in the real world.

194
00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.495
I have bills and rent I have to pay.

195
00:16:36.495 --> 00:16:38.247
- Ya know. there's more
to life than money.

196
00:16:38.247 --> 00:16:39.873
You gotta believe in somethin'.

197
00:16:39.873 --> 00:16:43.168
- Oh. and that got you so far. right?

198
00:16:43.168 --> 00:16:46.422
You're doin' science
experiments in a barn?

199
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:50.217
What are you doin'. man?

200
00:16:50.217 --> 00:16:52.469
Why don't you go get a real job?

201
00:16:52.469 --> 00:16:53.303
- A real job.

202
00:16:53.303 --> 00:16:54.763
This comin' from a guy who can't hold on

203
00:16:54.763 --> 00:16:56.932
to a job for more than a month.

204
00:16:56.932 --> 00:16:59.143
You gotta believe in something!

205
00:16:59.143 --> 00:17:01.145
You gotta go to a job every day.

206
00:17:01.145 --> 00:17:03.689
day in and day out and show up!

207
00:17:05.649 --> 00:17:06.483
- Show up?

208
00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:09.695
You're the last person
who should be talkin'

209
00:17:09.695 --> 00:17:10.863
about showin' up.

210
00:17:12.906 --> 00:17:15.159
What about my birthday?
Baseball games. huh?

211
00:17:16.201 --> 00:17:17.453
Now. you didn't show up.

212
00:17:18.412 --> 00:17:21.290
Ya know why? 'Cause I
wasn't your priority. Dad.

213
00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:23.584
That was.

214
00:17:30.591 --> 00:17:34.053
That's right. Reality
calls and you run away.

215
00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:35.637
Haven't changed a bit. have you?

216
00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:56.867
Okay. almost got it here.

217
00:17:56.867 --> 00:17:58.786
Hon. why'd
you get this new camera?

218
00:17:58.786 --> 00:17:59.620
- Huh?

219
00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:00.829
Want you to watch this.

220
00:18:00.829 --> 00:18:04.917
Well. I got this new
camera because I wanna get

221
00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:06.627
all his shenanigans on video.

222
00:18:06.627 --> 00:18:08.170
He's growin' up quick.

223
00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:09.546
- You know I don't like
havin' my picture taken.

224
00:18:09.546 --> 00:18:12.466
- It's not a picture. it's video.

225
00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:15.344
Hey. bud. get over-

226
00:18:17.387 --> 00:18:19.556
Why didn't you watch it?

227
00:18:19.556 --> 00:18:22.309
- I'm not the one who needs
to remember her. Kirk.

228
00:18:22.309 --> 00:18:25.062
Since when
have I become Kirk?

229
00:18:25.062 --> 00:18:27.064
- Since I stopped feelin' like your son.

230
00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:31.568
Since you abandoned the family.

231
00:18:31.568 --> 00:18:32.486
- Abandoned the family.

232
00:18:32.486 --> 00:18:34.988
Everything I've done was
for you and your mother.

233
00:18:34.988 --> 00:18:36.365
- You took me away from her.

234
00:18:38.075 --> 00:18:42.746
You separated us until the day she died.

235
00:18:42.746 --> 00:18:43.664
I was nine!

236
00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:48.585
No. no. no. no. No.

237
00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.507
How many days you seen me since then. huh?

238
00:18:54.633 --> 00:18:55.592
How many days. huh?

239
00:18:59.054 --> 00:18:59.930
You left me.

240
00:19:02.933 --> 00:19:04.810
You left me all by myself.

241
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.647
But it was for me and Mom. right?

242
00:19:09.606 --> 00:19:11.984
- I was just tryin' to protect you.

243
00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:13.068
I'm sorry if I-

244
00:19:13.068 --> 00:19:15.696
- Oh. shut up. I don't wanna
hear your sorry sermon.

245
00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:20.784
You can't paint the stripes
off a zebra. and you.

246
00:19:20.784 --> 00:19:23.287
you for damn sure can't
change who you are.

247
00:19:28.959 --> 00:19:30.294
Screw this. I'm outta here.

248
00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.673
Go ahead. delete my number.
Don't call me again.

249
00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:36.675
For the record.

250
00:19:39.636 --> 00:19:42.139
when Mom died. God. I wished it was you.

251
00:19:53.567 --> 00:19:55.736
- I wished it was me. too.

252
00:20:00.115 --> 00:20:02.034
Are you leaving now?

253
00:20:02.034 --> 00:20:04.161
- Yeah. I'm done with this shit

254
00:20:06.955 --> 00:20:08.165
- Look. man. why don't you
just leave in the morning?

255
00:20:08.165 --> 00:20:08.999
- No. man. okay.

256
00:20:08.999 --> 00:20:10.584
I gotta get outta here tonight.

257
00:20:13.295 --> 00:20:15.923
- Look. Tom. I get
you're very upset. okay.

258
00:20:15.923 --> 00:20:18.550
and you're very clearly drunk.

259
00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:21.220
I mean your BAC scores are
probably off the charts.

260
00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:24.973
Look. man. that's enough. that's enough.

261
00:20:28.435 --> 00:20:29.728
Just go lie down.

262
00:20:29.728 --> 00:20:34.733
Come on. you don't need
it. man. just here.

263
00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:37.236
Take a load off and you'll
feel better in the morning.

264
00:20:41.406 --> 00:20:42.908
You'll feel better. I promise.

265
00:20:46.078 --> 00:20:48.330
- Thanks. bud. I owe you one.

266
00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:49.164
You're right.

267
00:20:50.374 --> 00:20:51.416
- No problem.

268
00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:55.337
Goodnight.

269
00:21:01.927 --> 00:21:03.762
- Can't sleep. my love?

270
00:21:03.762 --> 00:21:05.597
Come here. little one.

271
00:21:15.357 --> 00:21:17.651
- I am the crown prince.

272
00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:19.069
Welcome to my secret world.

273
00:21:33.041 --> 00:21:35.419
- What are you doin' on
the floor. little buddy?

274
00:21:35.419 --> 00:21:36.878
It hurts.

275
00:21:36.878 --> 00:21:38.046
My hand. Mom. ow!

276
00:22:10.287 --> 00:22:11.121
- Dad.

277
00:22:30.349 --> 00:22:31.266
Drunk again. huh?

278
00:22:34.144 --> 00:22:37.022
Wake up. Hey.

279
00:22:37.022 --> 00:22:39.358
Dad. wake up.

280
00:22:41.276 --> 00:22:42.110
Dad!

281
00:22:45.822 --> 00:22:47.908
Bruno! Bruno!

282
00:22:49.701 --> 00:22:51.036
Hey. come on.

283
00:22:51.036 --> 00:22:51.870
What happened?

284
00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:54.039
- Come on. Come on. buddy. come on.

285
00:22:54.039 --> 00:22:55.374
Where ya at?

286
00:22:55.374 --> 00:22:56.750
- Oh my God. is that?

287
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:57.834
- I don't know. I don't know.
- Is that Dr. Davis?

288
00:22:57.834 --> 00:22:58.877
- Okay. I don't know what happened. okay?

289
00:22:58.877 --> 00:22:59.711
I just came in.

290
00:23:00.712 --> 00:23:02.297
- Is he?

291
00:23:02.297 --> 00:23:04.883
- He's not breathing.
I can't find a pulse.

292
00:23:07.302 --> 00:23:08.595
- We have to do somethin'.

293
00:23:10.889 --> 00:23:12.516
- I don't know what to do. man.

294
00:23:14.267 --> 00:23:16.561
- Okay. let's go figure somethin' out.

295
00:23:16.561 --> 00:23:17.979
Come on. Come on.

296
00:23:19.189 --> 00:23:20.440
Let's go. It's gonna be okay.

297
00:23:21.441 --> 00:23:23.360
It musta been a heart attack.

298
00:23:35.372 --> 00:23:38.125
Look. Tom. I feel
horrible for saying this.

299
00:23:38.125 --> 00:23:40.877
but we have to think practically.

300
00:23:42.129 --> 00:23:44.506
Okay. if we finish the
testing. we can sell the tech.

301
00:23:46.425 --> 00:23:47.426
- What about my dad?

302
00:23:48.677 --> 00:23:50.887
He was an asshole. but he's human.

303
00:23:50.887 --> 00:23:52.597
Okay. I gotta give him a proper burial.

304
00:23:52.597 --> 00:23:54.433
- If the FBI catch wind
of what we're doing here.

305
00:23:54.433 --> 00:23:57.602
do you know how much jail
time we could be facing?

306
00:23:57.602 --> 00:24:00.021
Okay. Article 4C specifically
sanctions against

307
00:24:00.021 --> 00:24:02.149
all non-chemical memory loss cures.

308
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:04.943
which is exactly what we're doing here.

309
00:24:04.943 --> 00:24:06.653
- Where are you gonna find a buyer?

310
00:24:06.653 --> 00:24:07.988
- Ya know Reinhard Kindler?

311
00:24:09.072 --> 00:24:09.906
Rocky.

312
00:24:11.992 --> 00:24:13.493
Okay. well. he knows someone who's ready

313
00:24:13.493 --> 00:24:15.412
to buy the finished product.

314
00:24:37.642 --> 00:24:38.852
- I'm sorry. Pops.

315
00:25:31.196 --> 00:25:35.325
Last night you had a massive
heart attack and you died.

316
00:25:37.327 --> 00:25:39.287
I found you in the lab.

317
00:25:42.332 --> 00:25:44.251
You were already gone by
the time I got to you.

318
00:25:48.672 --> 00:25:50.340
I'm sorry I couldn't help.

319
00:25:52.801 --> 00:25:55.887
Bruno and I are just gonna
take the research and...

320
00:26:00.517 --> 00:26:03.019
That's whatever. I just...

321
00:26:05.647 --> 00:26:09.693
I'm sorry for the way I treated
you last time I saw you.

322
00:26:09.693 --> 00:26:12.612
I shouldn't have acted like that.

323
00:26:21.204 --> 00:26:23.206
I don't even know if this is gonna work.

324
00:26:26.793 --> 00:26:31.172
This is Tom Davis. June 6th. 7:55 pm.

329
00:27:21.598 --> 00:27:22.432

330
00:27:22.432 --> 00:27:24.684

332
00:27:27.604 --> 00:27:29.189
fat nerds gulp donuts.

00:27:34.527 --> 00:27:38.448

- Dad. wake up.

343
00:28:11.106 --> 00:28:15.694
Last night you had a massive
heart attack and you died.

344
00:28:17.904 --> 00:28:19.072
I found you in the lab.

345
00:28:22.117 --> 00:28:24.452
You were already gone by
the time I got to you.

346
00:28:28.415 --> 00:28:30.583
I'm sorry I couldn't help.

347
00:28:36.256 --> 00:28:37.090
Hey. son.

348
00:28:38.383 --> 00:28:43.388
I've gone ahead and let
your news sink in. settle.

349
00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:48.059
Heart attack. huh?

350
00:28:50.228 --> 00:28:51.312
Yeah. your mother always told me

351
00:28:51.312 --> 00:28:53.231
I should lay off the beers and donuts.

352
00:28:56.818 --> 00:29:00.280
Well. it seems like a dream

353
00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:02.240
and I just need to wake up. but...

354
00:29:09.164 --> 00:29:14.169
Listen. Tom. I don't know
about surrogate loadin'.

355
00:29:16.755 --> 00:29:18.173
I can't have you doin' that.

356
00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:21.217
I don't know the side effects.
I mean. they could kill you.

357
00:29:29.726 --> 00:29:31.811
You gotta stop that. too.

358
00:29:38.234 --> 00:29:42.197
I'm not sure what you were talkin' about.

359
00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:48.787
the research. but

360
00:29:54.751 --> 00:29:56.252
I wish we completed it.

361
00:29:59.339 --> 00:30:02.050
I mean. we coulda saved so many families

362
00:30:03.468 --> 00:30:06.596
a lotta heartache. Tom. a lotta heartache.

363
00:30:10.433 --> 00:30:12.894
Ya know. I always wanted another kid.

364
00:30:12.894 --> 00:30:13.937
Mom. though. mm-mm.

365
00:30:16.105 --> 00:30:19.234
You were her full devotion.

366
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:26.115
I mean. she wanted to give you
every opportunity possible.

367
00:30:30.703 --> 00:30:34.123
She wanted you to be an astronaut.

368
00:30:34.123 --> 00:30:36.459
a doctor. a musician all at the same time.

369
00:30:41.005 --> 00:30:42.048
I miss her. Tom.

370
00:30:44.259 --> 00:30:45.385
I really miss your mom.

371
00:30:47.971 --> 00:30:48.972
And I've missed you.

372
00:30:55.353 --> 00:30:56.396
I miss our family.

373
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:19.961
Okay. almost got it here.

374
00:31:19.961 --> 00:31:21.504
Tom. why'd
you get this new camera?

375
00:31:21.504 --> 00:31:22.338
- Huh?

376
00:31:23.423 --> 00:31:27.677
Well. I got this new
camera because I wanna get

377
00:31:27.677 --> 00:31:29.554
all his shenanigans on video.

378
00:31:29.554 --> 00:31:30.889
He's growin' up quick.

379
00:31:30.889 --> 00:31:33.016
You know I don't
like havin' my picture taken.

380
00:31:33.016 --> 00:31:35.435
- It's not a picture. it's video.

381
00:31:36.853 --> 00:31:38.897
Hey. bud. get over here.

382
00:31:38.897 --> 00:31:41.107
Happy birthday. hon.

383
00:31:41.107 --> 00:31:42.775
I love you.

384
00:32:05.089 --> 00:32:05.924
One and two and three and four.

385
00:32:07.759 --> 00:32:08.801
- Tom.
- How many years ago

386
00:32:08.801 --> 00:32:09.802
.

387
00:32:09.802 --> 00:32:12.430
Come on. bud.
you're gonna have fun there.

388
00:32:14.515 --> 00:32:17.018
- This machine right here.
it's called a Scammer.

389
00:32:17.018 --> 00:32:18.686
It digitally scans your brain and-

390
00:32:18.686 --> 00:32:19.979
What's up. baby?

391
00:32:23.608 --> 00:32:24.984
This is your brain.

392
00:32:24.984 --> 00:32:26.402
I did you a favor.

393
00:32:26.402 --> 00:32:28.613
- Thank you. Dr. Davis.
- Believe this.

394
00:32:28.613 --> 00:32:30.073
Tom.

395
00:32:30.073 --> 00:32:32.742
- Tom!

396
00:32:54.305 --> 00:32:56.307
- Remind me again why you got it?

397
00:32:59.185 --> 00:33:00.603
Give it a rest. already.

398
00:33:04.857 --> 00:33:07.276
Mommy. you wanna play with me?

399
00:33:09.112 --> 00:33:11.572
Not now. buddy. Mommy's tired.

400
00:33:11.572 --> 00:33:12.740
Maybe later.

401
00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:14.033
- Why is she always tired?

402
00:33:14.033 --> 00:33:15.493
Can you come play with me?

403
00:33:15.493 --> 00:33:16.744
In a bit. okay.

404
00:33:20.248 --> 00:33:21.207
- Poor. baby doll.

405
00:33:22.667 --> 00:33:25.086
What was that boy's name?

406
00:33:25.086 --> 00:33:26.170
Who?

407
00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:28.089
The boy that was just in here.

408
00:33:28.965 --> 00:33:29.882
- Baby doll.

409
00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:32.135
No.

410
00:33:33.594 --> 00:33:35.013
- It's. um. it's...

411
00:33:38.891 --> 00:33:40.977
I don't know. what is it?

412
00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:42.895
It's Tom.

413
00:33:46.232 --> 00:33:47.233
Hey. kiddo.

414
00:33:49.027 --> 00:33:51.404
- Hey. Mom. How are you feeling?

415
00:33:51.404 --> 00:33:53.114
- You're a sweet little thing.

416
00:33:53.114 --> 00:33:55.158
What's your name. sweetie?

417
00:33:55.158 --> 00:33:57.535
- Sometimes you're silly. Mom. It's Tom.

418
00:33:58.578 --> 00:34:00.580
- That's a nice name. Where do you live?

419
00:34:01.497 --> 00:34:02.498
I live here.

420
00:34:03.624 --> 00:34:06.586
- No. we live here. Where do you live?

421
00:34:08.254 --> 00:34:10.089
Where are your parents?

422
00:34:15.762 --> 00:34:16.971
What's goin' on?

423
00:34:16.971 --> 00:34:17.805
It's okay. it's okay.

424
00:34:17.805 --> 00:34:19.015
- Who is he?

425
00:34:19.015 --> 00:34:19.849
Hey.

426
00:34:19.849 --> 00:34:21.976
Why is Mom asking where I live?

427
00:34:21.976 --> 00:34:23.770
Oh. she's just pretendin'.

428
00:34:24.645 --> 00:34:27.607
Ya know how you pretend when you play

429
00:34:27.607 --> 00:34:30.818
like you're a cowboy or a spaceman?

430
00:34:30.818 --> 00:34:32.945
- Yeah.
- That's what she's doin'.

431
00:34:32.945 --> 00:34:35.198
She's just pretendin'. Huh?

432
00:34:37.658 --> 00:34:38.743
Okay.

433
00:34:40.161 --> 00:34:41.954
Why don't you go in your room

434
00:34:41.954 --> 00:34:44.582
and I'll come in in a minute
and we could play. okay?

435
00:34:45.917 --> 00:34:46.918
Huh?
- Okay.

436
00:34:55.134 --> 00:34:57.178
- Hon. are you okay?

437
00:34:57.178 --> 00:34:58.638
Yeah. I'm okay. hon.

438
00:35:03.059 --> 00:35:04.644
Say goodbye to Mommy.

439
00:35:06.187 --> 00:35:08.523
But I don't
wanna leave my friends.

440
00:35:08.523 --> 00:35:10.358
I don't wanna go to a new school.

441
00:35:10.358 --> 00:35:11.192
Oh. come on. bud.

442
00:35:11.192 --> 00:35:12.693
You're gonna have fun there.

443
00:35:12.693 --> 00:35:15.071
- I don't wanna leave
Mom! I don't wanna go!

444
00:35:15.071 --> 00:35:17.657
Hey. if you don't
shut that door right now!

445
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:20.076
And just stop it.

446
00:35:22.078 --> 00:35:23.955
How many times have we been over this?

447
00:35:27.542 --> 00:35:28.376
Bye. hon!

448
00:35:30.086 --> 00:35:32.672
- Bye. Say hi to your cousin.

449
00:35:32.672 --> 00:35:34.423
- I will.
- She was.

450
00:35:34.423 --> 00:35:35.591
she was too young.
- I'll be back

451
00:35:35.591 --> 00:35:36.425
in time for supper.

452
00:35:36.425 --> 00:35:39.137
- She was too young for that.

453
00:35:39.137 --> 00:35:40.555
Love you.

454
00:35:59.073 --> 00:36:00.324
Why didn't you?

455
00:36:04.996 --> 00:36:06.330
How was that possible?

456
00:36:07.999 --> 00:36:10.877
How did Mom lose her memory?
I mean. she was young.

457
00:36:15.882 --> 00:36:17.049
Why didn't you tell me?

458
00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:23.514
I mean. I hated you. Dad.

459
00:36:24.807 --> 00:36:26.434
I hated you for so long.

460
00:36:26.434 --> 00:36:29.562
Why didn't you tell me? I woulda helped.

461
00:36:30.605 --> 00:36:32.648
I coulda helped. I coulda done something.

462
00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.362
I'm not smart enough to
finish this without you.

463
00:36:38.362 --> 00:36:39.572
I don't know what to do.

464
00:36:53.211 --> 00:36:54.045
- Hey. man.

465
00:36:54.045 --> 00:36:54.879
- Hey.

466
00:36:54.879 --> 00:36:55.713
- Guess what?

467
00:36:55.713 --> 00:36:57.715
I just called Rocky and he's
ready to buy everything.

468
00:36:57.715 --> 00:36:59.675
The Mint. the Scammer. all the papers.

469
00:37:01.636 --> 00:37:04.222
I negotiated a pretty good
price. too. so that's good.

470
00:37:04.222 --> 00:37:05.056
- Cool.

471
00:37:05.932 --> 00:37:08.184
Look. man. he can have
the Mint and Scammer.

472
00:37:08.184 --> 00:37:11.896
but I gotta keep the research materials.

473
00:37:13.022 --> 00:37:16.275
- What in the name of science
are you talking about?

474
00:37:16.275 --> 00:37:17.777
I gotta continue my dad's research.

475
00:37:17.777 --> 00:37:19.028
He was trying to cure Alzheimer's.

476
00:37:19.028 --> 00:37:20.071
I mean. if it-
- You're pullin'

477
00:37:20.071 --> 00:37:20.905
my leg. right?

478
00:37:20.905 --> 00:37:21.948
Come on. just help me pack.

479
00:37:21.948 --> 00:37:24.075
Why don't you grab that.
- No. I'm serious. okay.

480
00:37:24.075 --> 00:37:25.493
I gotta finish my dad's work.

481
00:37:27.578 --> 00:37:30.039
- You realize that in
just a few short hours

482
00:37:30.039 --> 00:37:33.376
we can have more money than
Shelby Cobras have horsepower?

483
00:37:33.376 --> 00:37:35.920
But you're just being unreasonable.

484
00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:37.088
- Okay. fine.

485
00:37:37.088 --> 00:37:39.090
Gimme a few hours. I'll make
copies of the schematics.

486
00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:40.341
It'll be fine.
- No. we can't make

487
00:37:40.341 --> 00:37:41.384
a copy. okay?

488
00:37:41.384 --> 00:37:44.136
The price includes exclusivity. all right?

489
00:37:44.136 --> 00:37:45.012
Do you know what that means?

490
00:37:45.012 --> 00:37:45.846
- Yes I do.

491
00:37:45.846 --> 00:37:48.182
- No. apparently you don't. okay?

492
00:37:48.182 --> 00:37:49.558
Do you know why somebody buys

493
00:37:49.558 --> 00:37:51.894
a Bugatti Veyron Pur Sang for $3 million?

494
00:37:53.062 --> 00:37:54.897
There's only five of
them in the entire world.

495
00:37:54.897 --> 00:37:57.608
That means only five people own them.

496
00:37:57.608 --> 00:38:00.903
It's exclusive. Exclusivity.

497
00:38:00.903 --> 00:38:03.322
Look. will you stop?

498
00:38:03.322 --> 00:38:04.782
Okay. give it a rest.

499
00:38:04.782 --> 00:38:07.618
- Dude. you seriously cannot
be doing this right now.

500
00:38:07.618 --> 00:38:10.162
- Look. if I can't make any
copies. I'm not selling it.

501
00:38:10.162 --> 00:38:12.665
- This is dead end research
with no practical use.

502
00:38:12.665 --> 00:38:14.500
- My mom had Alzheimer's. okay?

503
00:38:17.878 --> 00:38:18.713
- Excuse me.

504
00:38:19.922 --> 00:38:22.591
- That's why my dad started all this. man.

505
00:38:22.591 --> 00:38:24.135
That's why I have to finish it.

506
00:38:25.803 --> 00:38:27.388
Okay. look. I'm sorry. Bruno.

507
00:38:27.388 --> 00:38:30.224
Hey. but if I can't make
copies. I can't sell it.

508
00:38:35.938 --> 00:38:39.817
- Okay. but how are you
gonna finish the research?

509
00:38:41.777 --> 00:38:42.778
- I don't know. I have his notes.

510
00:38:42.778 --> 00:38:45.489
I can use those. I thought
maybe you could help.

511
00:38:45.489 --> 00:38:46.866
- Yeah. what if I don't wanna help?

512
00:38:48.159 --> 00:38:49.785
- Then it's just me and the notes.

513
00:38:51.329 --> 00:38:54.415
Come on.

514
00:38:54.415 --> 00:38:57.501
- All right. fine. I'll help
you. but we do this my way.

515
00:38:57.501 --> 00:38:59.086
- That's fine. That's fine.

516
00:38:59.962 --> 00:39:00.796
Just.

517
00:39:02.256 --> 00:39:04.759
I need your help with something. okay?

518
00:39:04.759 --> 00:39:05.968
Just come on.

519
00:39:44.131 --> 00:39:45.841
Everything okay?

520
00:39:45.841 --> 00:39:48.386
- Oh yeah. yeah. yeah. just my mom.

521
00:39:50.346 --> 00:39:52.556
She wants to see if I
went to temple or not.

522
00:39:53.724 --> 00:39:55.351
- Didn't know you were religious.

523
00:39:57.645 --> 00:39:58.854
- Here and there. Beer?

524
00:40:00.022 --> 00:40:01.357
- Didn't know you drank either.

525
00:40:02.274 --> 00:40:03.109
- Here and there.

526
00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:14.995
- Hey man. let's have a little fun.

527
00:40:14.995 --> 00:40:15.996
- What kind of fun?

528
00:40:18.332 --> 00:40:19.500
- Look you can trust me. all right.

529
00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:20.709
I'm a research assistant.

530
00:40:20.709 --> 00:40:21.919
- Man. that just sounds
like a redneck saying.

531
00:40:21.919 --> 00:40:24.255
"Here. hold my beer and watch this."

532
00:40:24.255 --> 00:40:26.507
Look. I don't wanna fry my brain.

533
00:40:26.507 --> 00:40:27.383
- You won't!

534
00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:29.093
All right. how 'bout this?

535
00:40:29.093 --> 00:40:31.095
- Okay. if it makes you feel better.

536
00:40:31.095 --> 00:40:33.097
I can load your backup first.

537
00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:34.849
Man. I don't...

538
00:40:34.849 --> 00:40:35.891
- Dude. come on.

539
00:40:35.891 --> 00:40:37.518
If something goes wrong. it'll be my brain

540
00:40:37.518 --> 00:40:38.352
that gets fried. right?

541
00:40:38.352 --> 00:40:39.979
You've got nothing to lose.

542
00:40:39.979 --> 00:40:42.606
And if it works. then we
can load mine onto yours.

543
00:40:45.526 --> 00:40:48.154
Dude. I said no to a buttload of money

544
00:40:48.154 --> 00:40:49.613
just to help you out.

545
00:40:49.613 --> 00:40:52.158
Okay. and besides. you owe me.

546
00:40:52.158 --> 00:40:53.325
Remember that night you got super drunk

547
00:40:53.325 --> 00:40:54.910
and I stopped you from leaving?

548
00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:56.370
Do you remember what you said?

549
00:40:56.370 --> 00:40:57.872
- I owe you.
- Yeah.

550
00:40:57.872 --> 00:40:59.457
- All right. fine.

551
00:41:05.546 --> 00:41:07.006
You sure this is gonna work?

552
00:41:07.006 --> 00:41:08.841
- Yeah. man. I've done
it before. all right?

553
00:41:08.841 --> 00:41:10.217
It's just like drivin' a-

554
00:41:10.217 --> 00:41:12.553
- No car analogies. okay. I don't get 'em.

555
00:41:12.553 --> 00:41:13.637
Whose backup did you load?

556
00:41:13.637 --> 00:41:15.014
- Ya know. nobody important.

557
00:41:15.014 --> 00:41:16.599
- Ya know if you keep doin' that.

558
00:41:16.599 --> 00:41:18.267
you're gonna get down to your knuckles?

559
00:41:18.267 --> 00:41:21.854
All right.
drivers. start your engines.

560
00:41:21.854 --> 00:41:23.689
- What did I just say?

561
00:41:23.689 --> 00:41:25.774
- I'm from the Motor City. man. I'm sorry.

562
00:41:27.776 --> 00:41:28.652
Okay. here we go.

563
00:41:39.914 --> 00:41:41.290
This is Dr. Kirk Davis.

564
00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:43.542
Sorry I missed your call.

565
00:41:43.542 --> 00:41:46.337
Leave a name and number
and I will call you back.

566
00:41:51.967 --> 00:41:53.260
Bruno. calm down. man.

567
00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:55.012
- Why do you keep calling me Bruno?

568
00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.014
I'm Tom.

569
00:41:58.224 --> 00:41:59.058
- No.

570
00:42:05.773 --> 00:42:07.024
What's my social?

571
00:42:07.024 --> 00:42:07.858
- What?

572
00:42:07.858 --> 00:42:09.026
- What's my social?

573
00:42:09.026 --> 00:42:11.487
- 645-52-6465.

574
00:42:11.487 --> 00:42:13.822
- That's crazy. What's our
deepest. darkest secret?

575
00:42:13.822 --> 00:42:15.366
- Backin' up over Joshua's
cat and then telling him

576
00:42:15.366 --> 00:42:17.493
it ran away when he couldn't find it.

577
00:42:17.493 --> 00:42:18.953
- Tat on my left chest.

578
00:42:18.953 --> 00:42:20.788
- Okay. stop. stop. that's enough.

579
00:42:20.788 --> 00:42:21.664
- Look. I'm sorry. bro.

580
00:42:21.664 --> 00:42:25.626
What do I call you? This is crazy.

581
00:42:28.504 --> 00:42:29.797
- Dear Chu. love you lots.

582
00:42:31.006 --> 00:42:32.841
The tat on your left chest.

583
00:42:32.841 --> 00:42:34.218
Dear Chu. love you lots.

584
00:42:38.639 --> 00:42:41.433
- Man. cheers to takin'
care of our own selves.

585
00:42:41.433 --> 00:42:42.226
- Cheers.

586
00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:52.945
- All right. let's go
inside. There's more beer.

587
00:43:03.914 --> 00:43:05.874
This is Dr. Kirk Davis.

588
00:43:05.874 --> 00:43:07.710
Sorry I missed your call.

589
00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:10.212
Leave a name and number
and I will call you back.

590
00:43:24.226 --> 00:43:25.477
- Are you okay?

591
00:43:29.273 --> 00:43:30.524
No. hey. Bruno.

592
00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:37.615
Tom?

593
00:43:38.532 --> 00:43:40.868
What the hell are you doing?

594
00:43:42.786 --> 00:43:43.621
Yo. Whoa.

595
00:43:50.127 --> 00:43:55.132
What are you doing?

596
00:44:04.475 --> 00:44:06.393
- Hey. Bruno. what are you doing?

597
00:44:06.393 --> 00:44:08.562
Bruno. stop! Stop!

598
00:44:08.562 --> 00:44:09.396
Stop!

599
00:44:17.321 --> 00:44:18.155
What is going on?

600
00:44:18.155 --> 00:44:19.740
Are you okay?

601
00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:21.533
Tom. are you okay?

602
00:44:22.701 --> 00:44:24.453
Are you okay?
- Yeah. yeah. yeah.

603
00:44:24.453 --> 00:44:25.412
- What is going on?

604
00:44:25.412 --> 00:44:26.580
Why was Bruno tryin' to choke you?

605
00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:28.415
- It's not Bruno. it's me.

606
00:44:28.415 --> 00:44:30.334
- What?

607
00:44:30.334 --> 00:44:33.545
- I circuit loaded my memory onto Bruno.

608
00:44:33.545 --> 00:44:35.297
- Okay. I don't know what that means.

609
00:44:35.297 --> 00:44:37.341
- I put my memory on Bruno.

610
00:44:37.341 --> 00:44:39.093
Ya know that's stupid.

611
00:44:39.093 --> 00:44:41.261
even for a stupid person.

612
00:44:41.261 --> 00:44:42.262
Where is your dad?

613
00:44:42.262 --> 00:44:44.348
Does he know what you guys are up to?

614
00:44:44.348 --> 00:44:45.474
- He isn't here.

615
00:44:45.474 --> 00:44:47.017
Well. where is he?

616
00:44:47.017 --> 00:44:50.312
- He's at a hospital.

617
00:44:50.312 --> 00:44:52.106
He's outta town.

618
00:44:52.981 --> 00:44:53.982
He's doin' research.

619
00:44:55.442 --> 00:44:57.736
- That's odd. 'cause he
didn't say anything to me.

620
00:44:57.736 --> 00:44:59.446
- Let's just get him inside. okay.

621
00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:02.658
- Okay. ready?

622
00:45:02.658 --> 00:45:04.034
- One. two.
- Come on.

623
00:45:04.034 --> 00:45:05.661
- Okay.

624
00:45:05.661 --> 00:45:06.453
- I gotcha. come on.

625
00:45:06.453 --> 00:45:07.538
- All right. this way. this way.

626
00:45:07.538 --> 00:45:08.372
- Let's go. buddy.

627
00:45:08.372 --> 00:45:10.374
Come on.
- Okay.

628
00:45:10.374 --> 00:45:11.625
Okay.

629
00:45:23.345 --> 00:45:25.597
Hey.
- Good mornin'.

630
00:45:28.225 --> 00:45:30.769
Mm. that's how your dad checks my math.

631
00:45:33.897 --> 00:45:35.315
Yeah. he's awesome.

632
00:45:36.442 --> 00:45:37.568
Who's awesome?

633
00:45:40.696 --> 00:45:41.530
- Not you.

634
00:45:43.449 --> 00:45:45.117
- So. what happened last night?

635
00:45:46.952 --> 00:45:47.953
- Oh. shoot.

636
00:45:49.329 --> 00:45:52.791
Your buddy here will
give you the low down.

637
00:45:53.667 --> 00:45:55.961
I have to vamoose to class.

638
00:45:55.961 --> 00:45:59.256
But in the meantime. don't you guys

639
00:45:59.256 --> 00:46:01.300
go messin' with things
that you don't understand.

640
00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:02.134
You hear me?

641
00:46:02.134 --> 00:46:02.968
- Yes. ma'am.

642
00:46:02.968 --> 00:46:04.052
- Yes. ma'am.

643
00:46:05.137 --> 00:46:06.805
There's still hope for
you yet. tenderfoot.

644
00:46:09.641 --> 00:46:13.103
- So. what happened
last night? Did it work?

645
00:46:13.103 --> 00:46:14.229
- For an hour.

646
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:17.191
- Okay. and then what?

647
00:46:17.191 --> 00:46:19.401
- The load went well.
but then you went crazy.

648
00:46:19.401 --> 00:46:21.737
I mean. you tried to attack me.

649
00:46:21.737 --> 00:46:23.864
- You mean you attacked yourself?

650
00:46:23.864 --> 00:46:25.449
- You threw things at me.

651
00:46:25.449 --> 00:46:27.993
You chased me around. you
put me in a choke hold.

652
00:46:27.993 --> 00:46:29.244
I mean. thank God Chloe showed up

653
00:46:29.244 --> 00:46:31.914
when she did and laid
you out with a shovel.

654
00:46:31.914 --> 00:46:34.374
- Okay. well. that explains this.

655
00:46:34.374 --> 00:46:36.293
God. she's got a mean swing.

656
00:46:36.293 --> 00:46:37.503
- Look. I'm not doin' that again. man.

657
00:46:37.503 --> 00:46:39.922
Okay. that scared the hell outta me.

658
00:46:39.922 --> 00:46:41.799
- Don't be such a downer. buddy. okay?

659
00:46:41.799 --> 00:46:44.384
Look at the shiny side. It worked.

660
00:46:45.928 --> 00:46:50.933
So. are you still against
selling this research?

661
00:46:51.016 --> 00:46:53.435
- She hit you a lot harder
than I expected. man.

662
00:46:56.188 --> 00:46:58.565
Do you not remember what
we discussed last night?

663
00:47:00.025 --> 00:47:01.693
I'm not selling. It's still a no.

664
00:47:07.324 --> 00:47:08.659
- It's fine.

665
00:47:08.659 --> 00:47:10.118
Just thought I'd ask again. ya know.

666
00:47:10.118 --> 00:47:11.370
just see what ya thought.

667
00:47:12.454 --> 00:47:13.956
Ya know what. this still kinda aches.

668
00:47:13.956 --> 00:47:17.334
so I think I'm gonna go get
it checked out at a doctors.

669
00:47:17.334 --> 00:47:18.585
- You want me to take you to the hospital?

670
00:47:18.585 --> 00:47:20.963
- No. no. no. no. no. It's fine.

671
00:47:20.963 --> 00:47:23.257
Just let me know where you'll be later.

672
00:47:23.257 --> 00:47:24.675
- The lab. Why?

673
00:47:24.675 --> 00:47:25.884
- Just wondering.

674
00:47:28.554 --> 00:47:29.388
- All right.

675
00:47:34.476 --> 00:47:35.561
How was that possible?

676
00:47:36.603 --> 00:47:39.439
How did Mom lose her memory?
I mean. she was young.

677
00:47:44.361 --> 00:47:46.154
Why didn't you tell me?

678
00:47:46.154 --> 00:47:48.615
I coulda helped. I coulda done something.

679
00:47:48.615 --> 00:47:50.576
I'm not smart enough to
finish this without you.

680
00:47:50.576 --> 00:47:51.785
I don't know what to do.

681
00:47:59.459 --> 00:48:01.503
Look. Dad. don't freak out. okay.

682
00:48:01.503 --> 00:48:03.338
Watch the video logs from yesterday.

683
00:48:03.338 --> 00:48:07.134
but I need your help to
complete the research. okay?

684
00:48:07.134 --> 00:48:08.635
I have no idea what I'm doing.

685
00:48:09.595 --> 00:48:13.098
I don't have any side effects
from yesterday. I feel fine.

686
00:48:13.098 --> 00:48:15.392
Plus I've loaded you once before.

687
00:48:15.392 --> 00:48:16.310
I think it's safe.

688
00:48:17.895 --> 00:48:20.689
What do ya say? Let's work together?

689
00:48:23.734 --> 00:48:28.739
I guess what I'm tryin' to
say is I'm not goin' anywhere.

690
00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:31.867
Okay. I'm staying here and
I'm gonna fulfill your legacy.

691
00:48:34.077 --> 00:48:37.956
Look. I just need you to do me a favor.

692
00:48:37.956 --> 00:48:41.084
Can we speed things up?

693
00:48:42.044 --> 00:48:43.629
It's really unsettling thinking about you

694
00:48:43.629 --> 00:48:44.963
using the bathroom as me.

695
00:48:46.798 --> 00:48:51.595
Anyways. this is Tom Davis.
June 7th. 8:15 am. 22 seconds.

696
00:48:52.763 --> 00:48:54.932
Surrogate loading Kirk Davis.

697
00:48:59.311 --> 00:49:00.145
Mornin'. son.

698
00:49:01.229 --> 00:49:04.107
I can see you're dead set on doin' this

699
00:49:04.107 --> 00:49:07.402
come hell or high water. so
might as well join the party.

700
00:49:09.321 --> 00:49:10.322
About your mother.

701
00:49:12.991 --> 00:49:14.284
yeah. she was young.

702
00:49:15.118 --> 00:49:19.998
too young for Alzheimer's.
but it's not impossible.

703
00:49:21.208 --> 00:49:23.502
There are certain genes.

704
00:49:23.502 --> 00:49:26.129
You got your APP. your PSEN1. PSEN2.

705
00:49:27.839 --> 00:49:30.092
Certain mutations can cause. well.

706
00:49:33.595 --> 00:49:36.556
an onset of symptoms early on.

707
00:49:40.727 --> 00:49:41.561
Tom. you.

708
00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:49.945
you got a 50/50 shot of havin'
the same genes as your mom.

709
00:49:53.198 --> 00:49:57.119
You been forgettin' where
you're puttin' your car keys?

710
00:49:59.037 --> 00:50:01.748
That's not meant to be a joke.

711
00:50:03.166 --> 00:50:05.335
Just watch for them patterns.

712
00:50:05.335 --> 00:50:07.671
and you let me know if
you see anything. okay?

713
00:50:34.031 --> 00:50:34.865
Hey. son.

714
00:50:36.283 --> 00:50:37.784
Memories with high emotion.

715
00:50:38.702 --> 00:50:40.495
they're retained for a longer time.

716
00:50:41.413 --> 00:50:44.291
Now. we can focus on this and
improve the CRUM percentage

717
00:50:44.291 --> 00:50:45.709
if we focus on the amygdala-

718
00:50:46.543 --> 00:50:47.377
cerebral cortex.

719
00:50:49.296 --> 00:50:53.508
Besides that. you can
continue to surrogate load.

720
00:50:53.508 --> 00:50:55.010
Okay. but under one condition.

721
00:50:57.137 --> 00:51:01.808
If you start experiencing
any side effects. you stop.

722
00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:04.061
Okay. immediately.

723
00:51:07.606 --> 00:51:09.483
I can't lose you. too. son.

724
00:51:11.068 --> 00:51:12.778
And I'll see you on the flip side.

725
00:51:19.076 --> 00:51:20.410
Yeah. hold on. Bruno.

726
00:51:28.085 --> 00:51:29.294
Hold up. Bruno.

727
00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:35.342
- I have a warrant for your arrest.

728
00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:37.969
- I'm sorry. a warrant for what?

729
00:51:37.969 --> 00:51:41.014
- For murdering your dad
and tampering with evidence.

730
00:51:42.724 --> 00:51:44.017
- I think there's been a confusion.

731
00:51:44.017 --> 00:51:45.769
My dad's still alive.

732
00:51:45.769 --> 00:51:47.270
- I know where you buried him.

733
00:51:48.814 --> 00:51:51.024
How could you know?

734
00:51:54.611 --> 00:51:57.364
All right. yeah. he died.
but it was of natural causes.

735
00:51:57.364 --> 00:51:59.157
You can't arrest me for that.

736
00:51:59.157 --> 00:52:00.784
- Tell it to the judge. kid.

737
00:52:03.703 --> 00:52:06.164
Why are you makin' this difficult?

738
00:52:06.164 --> 00:52:08.125
- Look. you don't have any evidence.

739
00:52:08.125 --> 00:52:08.959
Watch.

740
00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:36.111
- What the hell are you doin'?

741
00:52:36.111 --> 00:52:38.363
What are you doin' in here?

742
00:52:39.948 --> 00:52:41.491
- Doin' a video log.

743
00:52:41.491 --> 00:52:42.492
- Video log?

744
00:52:46.454 --> 00:52:47.706
Son of a bitch.

745
00:53:09.853 --> 00:53:11.605
- Is that enough proof for ya. son?

746
00:53:12.981 --> 00:53:14.399
Ow!

747
00:53:14.399 --> 00:53:16.401
Goddamn it! My bad foot.

748
00:53:19.529 --> 00:53:21.865
Once the FBI catches wind
of your rogue research.

749
00:53:21.865 --> 00:53:24.117
they will take everything.
no questions asked.

750
00:53:24.117 --> 00:53:25.827
You and your dad's work are done.

751
00:53:25.827 --> 00:53:27.162
- Look. I didn't kill him.

752
00:53:31.917 --> 00:53:33.293
Now make this easy. Tom.

753
00:53:33.293 --> 00:53:35.378
You are gonna go down one way or another.

754
00:53:39.674 --> 00:53:41.635
- Okay. fine. I'll come out.

755
00:53:53.563 --> 00:53:54.648
- Goddamn it.

756
00:54:42.612 --> 00:54:44.364
He got away.

757
00:54:44.364 --> 00:54:46.741
Does not matter as
long as you got what we wanted.

758
00:54:46.741 --> 00:54:47.575
- I got it.

759
00:54:55.542 --> 00:54:58.712
- Where's the headset?
Where's everything else?

760
00:54:58.712 --> 00:55:00.297
Hmm?

761
00:55:00.297 --> 00:55:03.174
- All right. take this idiot
and go get the rest of it.

762
00:55:03.174 --> 00:55:04.718
Don't look so confused.

763
00:55:04.718 --> 00:55:08.930
It applies equally to
both of you.

764
00:55:18.231 --> 00:55:19.733
Oh crap. Not now.

765
00:55:21.401 --> 00:55:23.903
Okay. just relax.

766
00:55:23.903 --> 00:55:25.238
Bruno. let's go.

767
00:55:28.283 --> 00:55:30.410
I know exactly what's
going on in your head.

768
00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:31.911
Just stay there.

769
00:55:32.746 --> 00:55:33.955
Just stay there.

770
00:55:36.082 --> 00:55:37.584
You hold him!

771
00:55:37.584 --> 00:55:38.835
- What's goin' on with him?
- Hold him for me.

772
00:55:38.835 --> 00:55:39.919
Bruno.
- What?

773
00:55:52.432 --> 00:55:54.559
What happened to him?

774
00:55:54.559 --> 00:55:55.518
- TICS.

775
00:55:55.518 --> 00:55:57.354
- You mean like Lyme disease?

776
00:55:57.354 --> 00:56:01.149
- T-I-C-S. time-induced
conflict by surrogacy.

777
00:56:01.149 --> 00:56:03.109
Simply put. this is when a surrogate

778
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:05.153
wants to get its body back.

779
00:56:05.153 --> 00:56:05.987
Why?

780
00:56:05.987 --> 00:56:09.199
- Surrogate loading separates
the brain from the body.

781
00:56:09.199 --> 00:56:10.158
disrupting the system.

782
00:56:10.158 --> 00:56:11.868
The surrogate will do whatever it can

783
00:56:11.868 --> 00:56:13.870
to get back to its home.

784
00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:17.040
Like a homing pigeon
finding its way back. hmm?

785
00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.166
Give me his watch.

786
00:56:19.042 --> 00:56:21.336
Somebody's coming. Let's go.

787
00:56:45.777 --> 00:56:48.530
- I swear. I didn't do any of it.

788
00:56:49.614 --> 00:56:52.242
I swear. I didn't do
anything in that video.

789
00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:59.332
I don't remember any of it. Dad.

790
00:56:59.332 --> 00:57:02.168
I drank that night. I did.
but I didn't black out.

791
00:57:11.553 --> 00:57:14.013
I don't know what's happening.

792
00:57:14.013 --> 00:57:17.016
I don't know if I have what Mom has.

793
00:57:20.061 --> 00:57:20.895
I need your help.

794
00:57:26.151 --> 00:57:28.486
I need your help really bad.

795
00:57:59.559 --> 00:58:00.435
Hey. Dad.

796
00:58:06.566 --> 00:58:08.234
Look. I don't have the best news.

797
00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:12.822
The cops. they caught wind of the research

798
00:58:12.822 --> 00:58:16.117
and we had to shut down.

799
00:58:18.286 --> 00:58:19.329
I don't think that I.

800
00:58:22.457 --> 00:58:24.375
I don't think we can
continue the research.

801
00:58:24.375 --> 00:58:25.585
I gotta stop.

802
00:58:26.461 --> 00:58:27.712
I mean. I have nowhere else to turn

803
00:58:27.712 --> 00:58:29.464
and I don't know what to do. and...

804
00:58:35.053 --> 00:58:39.224
I'm sorry.

805
00:58:39.224 --> 00:58:41.851
I'm sorry I let you down
when you needed me the most.

806
00:58:45.855 --> 00:58:46.898
I love you. Dad.

807
00:59:06.501 --> 00:59:08.002
Hey.
Monty. do you wanna go on

808
00:59:08.002 --> 00:59:09.462
out to the Hook Ranch?

809
00:59:09.462 --> 00:59:13.508
The old man's complainin'
about those coyotes again.

810
00:59:13.508 --> 00:59:14.342
Monty?

811
00:59:15.718 --> 00:59:17.136
Monty. you there?

812
00:59:18.555 --> 00:59:19.472
- Yeah. I'm here.

813
00:59:19.472 --> 00:59:22.308
Hey.
what's goin' on with you?

814
00:59:22.308 --> 00:59:25.103
- Two guys flagged me
down and next thing I know

815
00:59:25.103 --> 00:59:26.646
you're askin' me what happened.

816
00:59:29.816 --> 00:59:31.734
I need to get checked.

817
00:59:31.734 --> 00:59:32.569
Well. you ain't

818
00:59:32.569 --> 00:59:34.153
a spring chicken anymore. Monty.

819
00:59:35.071 --> 00:59:38.074
Swing by the ranch and then go
get checked out. you hear me?

820
00:59:39.701 --> 00:59:40.618
- Yes. ma'am.

821
01:00:08.771 --> 01:00:11.190
- Look. I don't have the best news.

822
01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:15.570
The cops. they caught wind
of the research and...

823
01:00:16.821 --> 01:00:17.655
Damn it.

824
01:00:17.655 --> 01:00:19.282
We had to shut down.

825
01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:20.533
Hand it to 'em.

826
01:00:20.533 --> 01:00:21.659
I don't think that I...

827
01:00:22.994 --> 01:00:25.163
It's okay. son. it's okay.

828
01:00:31.127 --> 01:00:32.879
Hand it to 'em. okay.

829
01:00:39.177 --> 01:00:44.182
- Well. well. look what
the Chupacabra dragged in.

830
01:00:44.182 --> 01:00:45.975
- Hey. hon.

831
01:00:45.975 --> 01:00:47.435
I just haven't seen you in a while

832
01:00:47.435 --> 01:00:48.311
and I thought I'd stop by and say hi.

833
01:00:48.311 --> 01:00:53.274
- Oh. easy there. cowboy.
I saw you this morning.

834
01:00:57.570 --> 01:01:00.531
- That's right. we did. 'cause I'm Tom.

835
01:01:00.531 --> 01:01:02.825
I don't know what I'm sayin' anymore.

836
01:01:04.577 --> 01:01:06.496
- That research gettin' to your brain?

837
01:01:09.624 --> 01:01:11.334
That was supposed to be funny.

838
01:01:11.334 --> 01:01:12.710
Whatever. What do you want?

839
01:01:13.961 --> 01:01:15.463
- The usual will be fine.

840
01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:18.675
Thirsty goat.

841
01:01:20.134 --> 01:01:21.302
- Just like your daddy.

842
01:01:24.722 --> 01:01:27.934
- Ya know. actually. lemme go
ahead and get three of those

843
01:01:27.934 --> 01:01:30.395
and three of those famous
Chloe blue whale shots.

844
01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:34.273
- Okay. hope you got company coming.

845
01:01:37.235 --> 01:01:38.069
- Just for me.

846
01:01:58.047 --> 01:01:58.881
- Hello?

847
01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:02.176
Hurry up.

848
01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:06.055
What's goin' on?

849
01:02:06.055 --> 01:02:08.683
- Is he back? Where is he?

850
01:02:08.683 --> 01:02:09.642
Kirk!

851
01:02:09.642 --> 01:02:11.018
- Oh my God.
- Kirk!

852
01:02:13.479 --> 01:02:15.648
You need to explain to me
what the hell is going on.

853
01:02:21.446 --> 01:02:22.947
- You're so stupid.

854
01:02:22.947 --> 01:02:24.907
Why am I stupid?

855
01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:26.159
- You have a hangover.

856
01:02:26.159 --> 01:02:28.745
You had eight beers and
four shots in 20 minutes.

857
01:02:28.745 --> 01:02:31.164
You were commode-hugging.
knee-walking drunk.

858
01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:32.206
What did you expect?

859
01:02:33.458 --> 01:02:35.585
- I haven't even been to your bar.

860
01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:37.211
- What?

861
01:02:37.211 --> 01:02:39.839
You're telling me that you
don't remember coming to my bar

862
01:02:39.839 --> 01:02:42.091
and ordering the same exact
drink that your dad orders.

863
01:02:42.091 --> 01:02:43.509
That's what you're telling me.

864
01:02:44.844 --> 01:02:46.888
- I didn't go to your bar.

865
01:02:49.098 --> 01:02:51.851
And even if I did. okay.
and I ordered the same beer.

866
01:02:53.019 --> 01:02:53.895
just calm down. okay?

867
01:02:53.895 --> 01:02:56.314
It's just a coincidence.
- Stop talking.

868
01:02:56.314 --> 01:02:58.983
You're digging yourself a
Texas-size hole. you know that?

869
01:02:58.983 --> 01:03:01.736
Ya know you used his
credit card to pay. right?

870
01:03:01.736 --> 01:03:02.570
Oh.

871
01:03:04.489 --> 01:03:05.698
Can't forget about this.

872
01:03:08.868 --> 01:03:09.702
Hmm?

873
01:03:13.998 --> 01:03:16.417
He's been gone for several
days and you tell me

874
01:03:16.417 --> 01:03:18.085
that all of a sudden. he goes outta town.

875
01:03:18.085 --> 01:03:20.922
which he hasn't done in
the past 10 years ever.

876
01:03:20.922 --> 01:03:23.049
And then you show up to my bar.

877
01:03:23.049 --> 01:03:26.469
calling me hon and dragging
up my ex-boyfriend.

878
01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:28.596
ordering the same beer
that your dad orders.

879
01:03:28.596 --> 01:03:29.597
and then this?

880
01:03:30.681 --> 01:03:33.434
Something's off and you need
to tell me what it is now.

881
01:03:36.562 --> 01:03:37.563
Where is he?

882
01:03:39.065 --> 01:03:40.608
Where is he?

883
01:03:40.608 --> 01:03:41.943
- He's dead.

884
01:03:41.943 --> 01:03:43.402
- What?

885
01:03:45.404 --> 01:03:48.115
- I think I killed him.

886
01:03:48.115 --> 01:03:50.201
You think what?

887
01:03:52.703 --> 01:03:53.955
- I killed him.

888
01:03:56.415 --> 01:03:57.500
I killed my dad.

889
01:04:00.795 --> 01:04:02.380
This better be the beer talking.

890
01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:07.343
- The other night I went to the lab.

891
01:04:11.138 --> 01:04:12.473
He was on the ground.

892
01:04:12.473 --> 01:04:13.599
He was...

893
01:04:13.599 --> 01:04:14.433
- He was what?

894
01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:17.019
Wake up!

895
01:04:18.479 --> 01:04:20.064
Why are you saying that
you killed your dad?

896
01:04:20.064 --> 01:04:21.274
Why are you saying that?

897
01:04:22.567 --> 01:04:24.235
You have two minutes to explain yourself

898
01:04:24.235 --> 01:04:25.444
or I'm calling the cops.

899
01:04:25.444 --> 01:04:26.279
Go.

900
01:04:29.407 --> 01:04:32.785
- I walked into the lab. okay.
and he was on the ground.

901
01:04:37.957 --> 01:04:40.251
- All right. that's it. I'm done.

902
01:04:40.251 --> 01:04:41.085
- No!

903
01:04:42.879 --> 01:04:44.130
- Then tell me!

904
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:49.468
- Just show it to you. okay?

905
01:04:49.468 --> 01:04:51.512
Show it to you. come on.

906
01:04:51.512 --> 01:04:52.346
- Touch me.

907
01:05:17.788 --> 01:05:18.748
You did this?

908
01:05:21.584 --> 01:05:24.795
How could you say you
don't remember doing this?

909
01:05:24.795 --> 01:05:26.047
- They showed me a video.

910
01:05:28.132 --> 01:05:33.137
I saw myself. okay. but
I don't remember. Chloe.

911
01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:35.181
I swear to God. I don't remember it.

912
01:05:35.181 --> 01:05:36.015
- How can someone forget something

913
01:05:36.015 --> 01:05:37.850
as important as killing someone?

914
01:05:40.436 --> 01:05:41.687
- I don't know.

915
01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:46.233
I might. I might have...

916
01:05:49.654 --> 01:05:50.655
- What your mom had?

917
01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:56.494
Oh God.

918
01:06:04.085 --> 01:06:05.586
This is too much.

919
01:06:10.299 --> 01:06:14.053
Your dad spent his entire life
trying to cure Alzheimer's

920
01:06:14.971 --> 01:06:19.016
and now you have the
same disease.

921
01:06:22.186 --> 01:06:23.020
- I don't know whether to go

922
01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:24.438
to the authorities or the hospital.

923
01:06:24.438 --> 01:06:27.441
Like. I don't know if I'm a
criminal or a patient. Chloe.

924
01:06:30.528 --> 01:06:31.362
What if I'm both?

925
01:06:33.781 --> 01:06:35.700
- Stop. stop.

926
01:06:37.284 --> 01:06:42.289
Look. even if you have Alzheimer's

927
01:06:47.378 --> 01:06:48.629
or even if you killed your dad.

928
01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:51.674
what could you do if you're in jail?

929
01:06:53.801 --> 01:06:58.431
The Tom I know is a good guy.
and he has a job to finish.

930
01:07:01.183 --> 01:07:02.435
And I'm here to help you.

931
01:07:03.894 --> 01:07:05.438
- I just don't know how. Chloe.

932
01:07:06.647 --> 01:07:09.442
I mean. our cover's blown.
the lab's inaccessible.

933
01:07:09.442 --> 01:07:11.485
the cops are on our tail right now.

934
01:07:11.485 --> 01:07:12.737
I just. I don't know how.

935
01:07:14.905 --> 01:07:15.990
- I may have a place.

936
01:07:17.241 --> 01:07:19.201
I mean. it's a dump. but it's secluded.

937
01:07:22.371 --> 01:07:25.332
- I think I should just turn
myself into the authorities.

938
01:07:25.332 --> 01:07:27.084
- No. don't. come on.

939
01:07:28.252 --> 01:07:29.086
Come with me.

940
01:07:31.005 --> 01:07:33.799
You can turn yourself in after you finish

941
01:07:33.799 --> 01:07:38.804
your dad's research. but until
then strap on your boots.

942
01:07:40.681 --> 01:07:42.558
We have strays to round up. Now.

943
01:08:08.959 --> 01:08:10.961
Like I said. I mean. it's
not much of a place. but.

944
01:08:10.961 --> 01:08:12.171
- What's the story?

945
01:08:14.381 --> 01:08:16.008
- It's my Uncle Mario's.

946
01:08:16.008 --> 01:08:17.718
Isn't he in jail? Oh.

947
01:08:28.813 --> 01:08:31.440
- Yeah. this is what I meant
by round up the strays.

948
01:08:34.193 --> 01:08:38.155
- Chloe. this is awesome. but
I gotta get my own equipment.

949
01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:44.411
- Wait. Wait!

950
01:08:45.830 --> 01:08:47.665
You can't go back to your
house or the lab. okay?

951
01:08:47.665 --> 01:08:48.791
It's a hot scene.

952
01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:50.000
You'll easily get arrested.

953
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.752
- Look. I have to get the files.

954
01:08:51.752 --> 01:08:52.920
I have to get my dad's laptop. okay.

955
01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:54.630
I have to rerecord the logs for him.

956
01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:56.090
Every time I upload 'em it's like starting

957
01:08:56.090 --> 01:08:57.633
at day one over and over again.

958
01:08:59.051 --> 01:09:00.594
- All right. you stay. I'll go.

959
01:09:02.054 --> 01:09:03.806
- You don't have access to the lab.

960
01:09:05.266 --> 01:09:07.434
- Well. you still need
a lookout. I'm coming.

961
01:09:09.228 --> 01:09:10.104
Can you be quick?

962
01:09:11.647 --> 01:09:12.481
- Yeah.

963
01:09:25.035 --> 01:09:25.870
- Wait.

964
01:09:27.788 --> 01:09:28.914
Go. go.

965
01:10:10.748 --> 01:10:11.624
Hey.

966
01:10:23.427 --> 01:10:24.970
Hey.

967
01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:48.160
- Look at me.

968
01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:10.349
I don't know what's goin' on anymore.

969
01:11:14.645 --> 01:11:19.650
I saw a video of me strangling
you. but I don't know.

970
01:11:19.942 --> 01:11:20.943
I don't know when it happened.

971
01:11:20.943 --> 01:11:22.319
I don't know how it happened.

972
01:11:22.319 --> 01:11:25.030
I can't remember a thing.
but I think I killed you and

973
01:11:28.033 --> 01:11:29.743
I think I might have what Mom had.

974
01:11:30.828 --> 01:11:35.082
I just. I don't trust myself anymore.

975
01:11:35.082 --> 01:11:35.916
Okay. you might.

976
01:11:43.507 --> 01:11:44.341
Come on.

977
01:11:50.347 --> 01:11:51.181
Hey. Dad.

978
01:11:52.474 --> 01:11:56.437
Look. last time you talked about amygdala.

979
01:11:58.647 --> 01:11:59.481
I don't know. I think you're right.

980
01:11:59.481 --> 01:12:01.150
There's a lotta potential.

981
01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:02.776
Just. what are CRUMS?

982
01:12:02.776 --> 01:12:04.028
How do I test for 'em?

983
01:12:04.028 --> 01:12:06.530
I mean. just let me know what to do.

984
01:12:07.906 --> 01:12:09.783
I'll see ya on the flip side.

985
01:12:09.783 --> 01:12:13.537
This is Tom Davis surrogate
loading Kirk Davis.

986
01:12:45.861 --> 01:12:47.404
- Tom. are you okay?

987
01:12:49.031 --> 01:12:50.407
Oh. Mr. Kirk?

988
01:12:52.576 --> 01:12:54.787
- Now you're catchin' on fast.

989
01:12:54.787 --> 01:12:56.080
Oh. that's nasty.

990
01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:57.915
Look. I just wanna thank
you for takin' care of Tom.

991
01:12:57.915 --> 01:12:59.416
Been a big help.

992
01:12:59.416 --> 01:13:00.376
- Yeah.

993
01:13:02.086 --> 01:13:03.754
Hey. you wanna see somethin' funny?

994
01:13:07.508 --> 01:13:08.801
He shouldn't be dippin'.

995
01:13:15.641 --> 01:13:18.644
Look. before we start studying
for that test of yours.

996
01:13:18.644 --> 01:13:20.396
I gotta ask you somethin'.

997
01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:24.024
You seen any changes
in Tom's mood recently?

998
01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:26.902
- Like?

999
01:13:29.279 --> 01:13:32.866
- Could be rage. anxiety. restlessness.

1000
01:13:38.705 --> 01:13:39.540
Chloe?

1001
01:13:42.918 --> 01:13:44.837
- No. no. none of that.

1002
01:13:46.630 --> 01:13:47.965
- Okay. good.

1003
01:13:49.383 --> 01:13:51.760
All right. well you know
how all this works. right?

1004
01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:54.304
The Scammer. the Mint.
how Tom loads my memory

1005
01:13:54.304 --> 01:13:55.722
onto himself and I wake up?

1006
01:13:57.850 --> 01:13:59.268
- Kind of. yeah.

1007
01:14:00.727 --> 01:14:02.688
- All right. well. it takes some time

1008
01:14:02.688 --> 01:14:05.232
before my memory transfers to him.

1009
01:14:05.232 --> 01:14:07.359
We'll call these load times.

1010
01:14:07.359 --> 01:14:10.571
Now. I've been monitoring
the past few days

1011
01:14:10.571 --> 01:14:12.364
and they've shortened significantly.

1012
01:14:13.282 --> 01:14:16.160
- But faster is better. right?

1013
01:14:17.035 --> 01:14:18.287
- Well. not in this case.

1014
01:14:20.539 --> 01:14:21.832
It's inversely proportional

1015
01:14:21.832 --> 01:14:23.584
to the delta neural mapping of the brain.

1016
01:14:23.584 --> 01:14:26.962
Now. the smaller
difference between the host

1017
01:14:26.962 --> 01:14:30.507
and the loaded memory. quicker the upload.

1018
01:14:32.926 --> 01:14:34.136
- Okay. you know that I have trouble

1019
01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:35.512
with simple algebra. right?

1020
01:14:36.430 --> 01:14:38.974
Can you just tell me
whether that's good or bad?

1021
01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:40.309
- I don't think it's good.

1022
01:14:44.062 --> 01:14:47.024
- And you said that rage was
a side effect of all this?

1023
01:14:47.024 --> 01:14:48.525
- Yeah. it could be.

1024
01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:53.530
Why. is Tom showing rage?

1025
01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:56.200
- I told you no.

1026
01:14:59.703 --> 01:15:00.537
- Okay.

1027
01:15:01.955 --> 01:15:05.167
Well look. why don't you
look over the polynomials.

1028
01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:08.337
We'll study in a little
bit together. okay?

1029
01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:09.171
- Okay.

1030
01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:43.455
.

1031
01:15:55.634 --> 01:15:56.468
- Tom!

1032
01:15:58.011 --> 01:15:58.971
What are you doing?

1033
01:16:03.267 --> 01:16:04.309
- I thought you were.

1034
01:16:07.479 --> 01:16:08.689
I thought you were...

1035
01:16:11.066 --> 01:16:15.195
- Ya know what. forget it. Come with me.

1036
01:16:15.195 --> 01:16:16.405
So your dad said that you need

1037
01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:19.283
to rerecord your brain on the scanner?

1038
01:16:19.283 --> 01:16:20.534
- No. it's a Scammer.

1039
01:16:20.534 --> 01:16:21.368
- Okay. whatever.

1040
01:16:21.368 --> 01:16:23.662
I can't keep track of all these acronyms.

1041
01:16:23.662 --> 01:16:25.956
a Scammer. Mint. CRUMS.

1042
01:16:25.956 --> 01:16:27.165
I mean. how many acronyms
can one person come up with?

1043
01:16:27.165 --> 01:16:28.709
Amen.

1044
01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:29.585
- Glad you agree.

1045
01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:34.047
- Hey. acronyms make
everything nifty.

1046
01:16:36.008 --> 01:16:36.842
Why am I stupid?

1047
01:16:39.303 --> 01:16:41.930
I hope Chloe told you what's goin' on.

1048
01:16:41.930 --> 01:16:44.808
I need you to make a backup
copy of your memory tonight.

1049
01:16:44.808 --> 01:16:46.018
okay. and leave me the old noggin

1050
01:16:46.018 --> 01:16:47.978
and the new noggin to compare tomorrow.

1051
01:16:48.895 --> 01:16:49.938
It's important. Tom.

1052
01:16:51.273 --> 01:16:52.899
I saw today's updates. I mean.

1053
01:16:54.776 --> 01:16:57.571
your bug fix on the self-referencing loop.

1054
01:16:57.571 --> 01:17:01.158
I mean. you got the whole
time up to 12 hours now.

1055
01:17:04.661 --> 01:17:07.331
You're findin' things that
never even occurred to me.

1056
01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:15.839
I'm proud of you. son.
I'm so proud of you.

1057
01:17:18.425 --> 01:17:19.676
About your question on CRUMs.

1058
01:17:19.676 --> 01:17:24.306
it stands for causal residual
from unloaded memory.

1059
01:17:24.306 --> 01:17:29.102
Okay. now that's memory retained
after the Mint turns off.

1060
01:17:29.102 --> 01:17:30.896
It's like muscle memory.

1061
01:17:31.813 --> 01:17:35.901
Now. the more you upload
the more permanent

1062
01:17:35.901 --> 01:17:36.943
that memory becomes.

1063
01:17:39.404 --> 01:17:42.032
Are you okay. Mr. Kirk?

1064
01:17:42.032 --> 01:17:43.742
- Everything's fine. hon.

1065
01:17:43.742 --> 01:17:46.578
Why don't you pack your stuff up?

1066
01:17:46.578 --> 01:17:47.746
I'm about to finish up.

1067
01:17:51.416 --> 01:17:54.961
Son. I feel like you're
hidin' somethin' from me.

1068
01:17:56.588 --> 01:17:59.174
If you start experiencing
anything. you let me know.

1069
01:18:02.636 --> 01:18:03.595
You let her know.

1070
01:19:01.278 --> 01:19:05.073
Thanks for the tin of tobacco. Funny.

1071
01:19:05.949 --> 01:19:10.120
I got you a beer. okay? Cheers.

1072
01:19:13.165 --> 01:19:14.791
Ya know. it's been bothering me.

1073
01:19:16.710 --> 01:19:18.420
I never asked you how you met Mom.

1074
01:19:19.671 --> 01:19:22.215
where you guys went on
your first date and...

1075
01:21:09.823 --> 01:21:12.325
This can't be happening.

1076
01:21:25.589 --> 01:21:27.173
Oh. no. no. no. no.

1077
01:21:52.824 --> 01:21:55.493
Tom. I compared both your noggins.

1078
01:21:56.369 --> 01:21:58.830
It varies by 30%.

1079
01:21:58.830 --> 01:21:59.748
That's because it-

1080
01:22:00.749 --> 01:22:02.542
Listen. before you say
that's because the brain's

1081
01:22:02.542 --> 01:22:05.003
always changing. yes. it is. okay.

1082
01:22:05.003 --> 01:22:07.005
but not by that much in just a week. Tom.

1083
01:22:07.005 --> 01:22:08.965
I mean 10. 15 years maybe. but.

1084
01:22:10.342 --> 01:22:12.886
I mean. just look at this. okay.

1085
01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:19.184
Now. this is your brain compared to mine.

1086
01:22:20.477 --> 01:22:23.229
I ain't gotta tell you what's goin' on.

1087
01:22:23.229 --> 01:22:25.190
My mind is eatin' away at your brain

1088
01:22:25.190 --> 01:22:28.610
and your memories are
gettin' corrupted.

1089
01:22:31.404 --> 01:22:34.074
You ain't never seen this bridge before.

1090
01:22:34.074 --> 01:22:35.575
I took your mom here on
our first date. okay.

1091
01:22:35.575 --> 01:22:37.243
This is the Trinity River Bridge.

1092
01:22:37.243 --> 01:22:38.954
And this. This?

1093
01:22:39.871 --> 01:22:41.790
I etched this on my
best friend's pencil box

1094
01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:44.125
before he passed away
back in the fourth grade.

1095
01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:47.629
I don't know what this is.

1096
01:22:48.546 --> 01:22:51.675
Tom. these ain't your nightmares. okay?

1097
01:22:55.553 --> 01:22:59.474
These are my memories. and my brain is.

1098
01:22:59.474 --> 01:23:01.267
my brain's corrupting your cerebrum.

1099
01:23:05.063 --> 01:23:07.399
Tom. you gotta stop loadin' me.

1100
01:23:07.399 --> 01:23:10.276
Okay. the 30% variation. that can cause

1101
01:23:10.276 --> 01:23:12.070
serious risk to your life.

1102
01:23:15.323 --> 01:23:16.866
I can't lose you for my quest.

1103
01:23:19.077 --> 01:23:20.912
Stop loading me.

1104
01:23:22.497 --> 01:23:23.331
I have to go.

1105
01:23:24.958 --> 01:23:25.875
I love you. son.

1106
01:23:30.964 --> 01:23:34.551
- So. what are Waylon
and Shooter up to today?

1107
01:23:37.470 --> 01:23:39.931
Waylon and Shooter? Jennings?

1108
01:23:39.931 --> 01:23:41.433
- No.

1109
01:23:41.433 --> 01:23:42.267
- Forget it.

1110
01:23:43.101 --> 01:23:43.935
What'd your dad say?

1111
01:23:43.935 --> 01:23:45.061
- Uh. nothing.

1112
01:23:45.061 --> 01:23:46.604
Look at this.

1113
01:23:46.604 --> 01:23:49.274
You ain't never seen this bridge before.

1114
01:23:49.274 --> 01:23:50.775
I took your mom here on
our first date. okay.

1115
01:23:50.775 --> 01:23:52.152
This is the Trinity River Bridge.

1116
01:23:52.152 --> 01:23:54.988
And this. This?

1117
01:23:54.988 --> 01:23:56.948
I etched this on my
best friend's pencil box

1118
01:23:56.948 --> 01:23:59.325
before he passed away
back in the fourth grade.

1119
01:24:00.827 --> 01:24:02.662
I don't know what this is.

1120
01:24:02.662 --> 01:24:04.122
- Wait a second.

1121
01:24:07.917 --> 01:24:09.169
Where are these drawings?

1122
01:24:10.336 --> 01:24:11.838
- I threw 'em away.

1123
01:24:11.838 --> 01:24:12.756
I don't know what he did with them.

1124
01:24:12.756 --> 01:24:14.299
- How did you know about them?

1125
01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:18.178
- They keep showin' up in my nightmares.

1126
01:24:18.178 --> 01:24:20.555
I don't think I've seen 'em anywhere.

1127
01:24:23.975 --> 01:24:25.602
What are you doing?

1128
01:24:32.275 --> 01:24:34.694
How is it that you
drew the same thing I drew?

1129
01:24:40.617 --> 01:24:41.910
- I don't know.

1130
01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:44.120
Well. that's your math test.
My dad probably saw it.

1131
01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:45.455
- No. no. look.

1132
01:24:46.664 --> 01:24:47.916
I scored a 40 on this.

1133
01:24:48.792 --> 01:24:51.503
I didn't show it to him
'cause I knew he'd be pissed.

1134
01:24:51.503 --> 01:24:53.755
Wait. so he ain't ever seen this?

1135
01:24:55.924 --> 01:24:57.467
- You could bet the ranch on it.

1136
01:25:01.638 --> 01:25:02.972
- Okay. that doesn't make any sense.

1137
01:25:02.972 --> 01:25:05.433
If he ain't never seen
it. I've never seen it.

1138
01:25:05.433 --> 01:25:07.477
then why does it keep
showin' up in my nightmares?

1139
01:25:09.562 --> 01:25:11.064
Did someone at the bar see it?

1140
01:25:12.023 --> 01:25:14.776
- I mean. I've had it at the bar.

1141
01:25:14.776 --> 01:25:16.152
I'm sure it's possible.

1142
01:25:17.695 --> 01:25:18.530
- Let's go.

1143
01:25:18.530 --> 01:25:21.282
- Where are we going?
- Let's go.

1144
01:25:22.534 --> 01:25:25.078
- Okay. driving like a madman
isn't gonna solve anything.

1145
01:25:25.078 --> 01:25:27.455
- Do you have access to
the cameras at your bar?

1146
01:25:27.455 --> 01:25:28.373
- Yes. Why?

1147
01:25:28.373 --> 01:25:29.916
- Because I wanna see who
else was there that night.

1148
01:25:29.916 --> 01:25:32.293
I mean. someone had to see your drawing.

1149
01:25:32.293 --> 01:25:34.212
- Okay. even if someone
did see my drawings.

1150
01:25:34.212 --> 01:25:35.130
how did it end up in your dreams?

1151
01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:35.964
- I don't know!

1152
01:25:35.964 --> 01:25:37.841
Okay. right now I have way more questions

1153
01:25:37.841 --> 01:25:39.134
than I have answers. just like you.

1154
01:25:39.134 --> 01:25:40.635
- Okay. well slow down.

1155
01:25:46.975 --> 01:25:47.976
It's not turning on.

1156
01:25:51.146 --> 01:25:51.980
Damn it.

1157
01:25:53.898 --> 01:25:55.358
You got any receipts?

1158
01:25:55.358 --> 01:25:56.943
Yeah.

1159
01:26:07.662 --> 01:26:08.746
- Are these by date?

1160
01:26:08.746 --> 01:26:10.373
- Yeah.

1161
01:26:10.373 --> 01:26:12.250
- Gimme that test out
of your bag right there.

1162
01:26:12.250 --> 01:26:15.170
I wanna see what day you drew that.

1163
01:26:18.882 --> 01:26:21.467
- There. it was June 4th.

1164
01:26:21.467 --> 01:26:24.220
- That was the day before my dad died.

1165
01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:26.139
Where do you keep his receipts?

1166
01:26:28.725 --> 01:26:30.268
- In here.

1167
01:26:30.268 --> 01:26:32.854
- Find me a stack from June 4th.

1168
01:26:37.609 --> 01:26:39.194
- Got it. June 4th.

1169
01:26:50.788 --> 01:26:51.623
What?

1170
01:26:53.249 --> 01:26:54.125
Reinhard Kindler.

1171
01:26:55.251 --> 01:26:56.085
Who's that?

1172
01:26:58.755 --> 01:27:00.381
- He worked for my dad.

1173
01:27:00.381 --> 01:27:02.884
- Okay. so he met your dad here.

1174
01:27:02.884 --> 01:27:04.219
- No. no. my dad kicked
him out of his lab.

1175
01:27:04.219 --> 01:27:06.262
He woulda never met him here.

1176
01:27:06.262 --> 01:27:08.389
- Yeah. well. it looked he had company.

1177
01:27:10.558 --> 01:27:11.392
Look.

1178
01:27:14.771 --> 01:27:15.605
- Bruno.

1179
01:27:18.107 --> 01:27:21.069
- Okay. well. let's say
Bruno did see my sketch.

1180
01:27:21.069 --> 01:27:23.238
I mean still. how did you...

1181
01:27:35.625 --> 01:27:36.918
What are you looking for?

1182
01:27:36.918 --> 01:27:39.170
- They think I'm so stupid.

1183
01:27:44.634 --> 01:27:46.844
- Son of a bitch.

1184
01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:57.480
- So. this is the video
that the cop showed you?

1185
01:27:57.480 --> 01:27:59.107
- Yeah. Just hold on.

1186
01:28:03.444 --> 01:28:05.655
- I've never seen you
bite your nails before.

1187
01:28:05.655 --> 01:28:08.032
- That's because I don't. Bruno does.

1188
01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:20.336
- Wait. so Bruno killed your dad?

1189
01:28:22.755 --> 01:28:24.382
Don't you know what this means?

1190
01:28:24.382 --> 01:28:26.259
This means that you didn't kill your dad.

1191
01:28:26.259 --> 01:28:29.679
This means you're not guilty.
They can't arrest you.

1192
01:28:32.932 --> 01:28:35.059
- The video clearly shows me killing him.

1193
01:28:35.059 --> 01:28:37.603
I mean. my fingerprints are everywhere.

1194
01:28:37.603 --> 01:28:40.023
I mean. how am I supposed to
prove that I didn't do it?

1195
01:28:41.482 --> 01:28:44.027
- Can't you just show the
court how the Mint works?

1196
01:28:44.027 --> 01:28:46.904
- No. the FDA. the CDC.
this is all illegal to them.

1197
01:28:47.822 --> 01:28:49.699
They won't let me use illegal
research in a court of law.

1198
01:28:49.699 --> 01:28:50.616
It's inadmissible.

1199
01:28:53.369 --> 01:28:54.829
Square one. Great.

1200
01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:11.179
- Look. there should be
something that we could do.

1201
01:29:11.179 --> 01:29:12.430
The truth is on our side.

1202
01:29:13.306 --> 01:29:15.641
- Yeah. well. sometimes
that's not enough. hon.

1203
01:29:16.851 --> 01:29:18.811
There's nothin' more we can do. nothin'

1204
01:29:21.647 --> 01:29:23.566
I gotta tell my dad what happened.

1205
01:29:24.484 --> 01:29:26.402
He deserves to know the truth at least.

1206
01:29:28.946 --> 01:29:30.615
You didn't die of a heart attack.

1207
01:29:31.991 --> 01:29:34.327
You were murdered. strangled by me.

1208
01:29:35.703 --> 01:29:36.537
- Tom. stop.

1209
01:29:37.747 --> 01:29:38.748
Okay. you know what your dad said.

1210
01:29:38.748 --> 01:29:41.667
You might've already damaged
yourself beyond repair.

1211
01:29:41.667 --> 01:29:43.252
- Bruno and Rocky had
somethin' to do with it.

1212
01:29:43.252 --> 01:29:46.255
I just don't know how to prove it.

1213
01:29:51.094 --> 01:29:53.179
I'm sorry for hating you.

1214
01:29:54.555 --> 01:29:57.892
I'm sorry for letting you down
and I'm sorry for everything.

1215
01:29:58.768 --> 01:30:00.061
I love you so much.

1216
01:30:03.147 --> 01:30:04.482
You get to be with Mom now.

1217
01:30:07.693 --> 01:30:09.654
I'll see ya soon.

1218
01:30:24.627 --> 01:30:26.087
I love you so much.

1219
01:30:29.298 --> 01:30:30.842
And you get to be with Mom now.

1220
01:30:33.761 --> 01:30:34.595
I'll see ya soon.

1221
01:30:39.976 --> 01:30:41.477
- Hey.

1222
01:30:41.477 --> 01:30:42.395
- Hey. hon.

1223
01:30:44.147 --> 01:30:48.025
- Look. I'm sorry for
everything. Mr. Kirk.

1224
01:30:49.152 --> 01:30:51.654
- You didn't do a thing wrong.

1225
01:30:52.947 --> 01:30:55.783
Now. gimme a second in here.

1226
01:30:55.783 --> 01:30:57.618
I need to record somethin' for Tom.

1227
01:30:59.412 --> 01:31:00.246
- Okay.
- Hey.

1228
01:31:01.247 --> 01:31:03.624
Thank you for everything.

1229
01:31:05.293 --> 01:31:06.502
You take care of my boy.

1230
01:31:07.837 --> 01:31:08.963
Don't forget to study.

1231
01:31:10.882 --> 01:31:13.926
- I will.

1232
01:31:13.926 --> 01:31:15.344
- Okay.
- Okay.

1233
01:31:15.344 --> 01:31:17.096
- I'll see ya in a minute.

1234
01:31:17.096 --> 01:31:17.930
- Okay.

1235
01:31:43.372 --> 01:31:44.207
- I know.

1236
01:31:45.291 --> 01:31:47.710
I know Rocky had somethin' to do with it.

1237
01:31:47.710 --> 01:31:48.836
No doubt in my mind.

1238
01:31:49.712 --> 01:31:52.006
Greed's always motivated that man.

1239
01:31:52.006 --> 01:31:53.382
Morals never got in his way.

1240
01:32:02.391 --> 01:32:03.601
I'm so proud of you.

1241
01:32:07.063 --> 01:32:09.649
I'm so proud of you. Tom.

1242
01:32:11.651 --> 01:32:13.194
And I'm thankful that I got to spend

1243
01:32:13.194 --> 01:32:14.529
the last few days with you.

1244
01:32:20.409 --> 01:32:21.619
I spent 20 years

1245
01:32:25.164 --> 01:32:27.333
tryin' to save everyone's
precious memories.

1246
01:32:29.585 --> 01:32:31.921
I done went and forgot to create my own.

1247
01:32:44.475 --> 01:32:45.309
The videos of your mother.

1248
01:32:45.309 --> 01:32:50.064
those are the first real little noggins.

1249
01:32:52.024 --> 01:32:55.570
And you save those and
you use 'em as motivation.

1250
01:33:00.199 --> 01:33:01.826
I wish I had more time with you.

1251
01:33:04.620 --> 01:33:06.914
I would have taught you the Kirk slider.

1252
01:33:37.361 --> 01:33:39.947
This the end of the road. Tom.

1253
01:33:43.367 --> 01:33:45.953
It was just a unrealized dream.

1254
01:33:52.293 --> 01:33:53.628
An unfinished quest.

1255
01:33:59.216 --> 01:34:00.635
Just a path to nowhere.

1256
01:34:19.570 --> 01:34:22.031
I'm proud of you. proud of you.

1257
01:34:26.661 --> 01:34:28.954
You're gonna do somethin' in life.

1258
01:34:40.716 --> 01:34:42.218
I love you. son.

1259
01:34:42.218 --> 01:34:43.803
- Hey. is everything okay?

1260
01:35:00.069 --> 01:35:01.153
Are you okay?

1261
01:35:01.153 --> 01:35:02.947
- I don't know what happened.

1262
01:35:23.134 --> 01:35:25.219
You know that
Bruno's not gonna talk to you.

1263
01:35:25.219 --> 01:35:28.806
and he's sure as hell not gonna
own up to killing your dad.

1264
01:35:29.765 --> 01:35:33.018
- Well. he might not talk to
me. but he will talk to Rocky.

1265
01:35:48.284 --> 01:35:50.244
You really think
he's gonna fall for that?

1266
01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:54.749
- As long as there's money involved. yeah.

1267
01:36:09.096 --> 01:36:10.765
- Okay. So now what?

1268
01:36:12.391 --> 01:36:15.811
- I'm gonna lure Rocky here.
we'll bring him inside.

1269
01:36:15.811 --> 01:36:19.106
and we'll take him down
and load my backup to him.

1270
01:36:19.106 --> 01:36:21.150
- How are we gonna take him down?

1271
01:36:25.112 --> 01:36:26.614
- You're gonna have to seduce him.

1272
01:36:26.614 --> 01:36:29.575
Not even seduce. actually.
just flirt with him.

1273
01:36:29.575 --> 01:36:31.744
I mean. you know how to flirt. right?

1274
01:36:31.744 --> 01:36:33.037
- I wasn't born yesterday.

1275
01:36:33.996 --> 01:36:35.873
- We're gonna upload my backup.

1276
01:36:35.873 --> 01:36:37.541
I'm gonna go as Rocky. talk to Bruno.

1277
01:36:37.541 --> 01:36:39.084
pull the confession out of him.

1278
01:36:40.169 --> 01:36:42.963
Before we do that though.
I need to make a backup.

1279
01:36:44.632 --> 01:36:45.633
Hand me those pills.

1280
01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:54.141
- Do you really think this is legit?

1281
01:36:54.141 --> 01:36:55.351
I mean. there's no way that Tom

1282
01:36:55.351 --> 01:36:57.311
finished the research on his own.

1283
01:36:57.311 --> 01:36:58.729
Hey. no wasting. right?

1284
01:36:59.605 --> 01:37:02.399
- Look at the code
samples on the algorithm.

1285
01:37:02.399 --> 01:37:04.401
This is definitely new
work. No doubt about it.

1286
01:37:04.401 --> 01:37:06.654
- Okay. but we took all the
important research materials

1287
01:37:06.654 --> 01:37:08.155
from the lab.

1288
01:37:08.155 --> 01:37:10.866
- That may be true. but the
goose that laid the golden egg

1289
01:37:10.866 --> 01:37:13.285
just landed in our lap for a second time.

1290
01:37:15.579 --> 01:37:19.208
- I'm not sure that I follow.

1291
01:37:22.336 --> 01:37:26.382
- Okay. listen. Darjeeling
Limited. emphasis on the limited.

1292
01:37:26.382 --> 01:37:28.217
we will test the Mint.

1293
01:37:28.217 --> 01:37:30.886
- If it works. like he says it should.

1294
01:37:30.886 --> 01:37:33.556
we will take it from him.

1295
01:37:33.556 --> 01:37:35.850
- He's not just gonna hand
it over to you. is he?

1296
01:37:35.850 --> 01:37:37.309
No Bruno. he's not.

1297
01:37:41.605 --> 01:37:43.399
- No. No. no. no. no. no.

1298
01:37:43.399 --> 01:37:44.400
Okay. you're not expecting me

1299
01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:46.360
to surrogate load Tom again. are you?

1300
01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:47.528
- Exactly.

1301
01:37:47.528 --> 01:37:49.864
- I'm sorry. but that's
not gonna happen. okay?

1302
01:37:49.864 --> 01:37:52.157
Ever since you loaded
that dog brain onto me.

1303
01:37:52.157 --> 01:37:54.076
I've been dreaming in muted colors. okay?

1304
01:37:54.076 --> 01:37:55.327
So. I'm sorry. but no.

1305
01:37:57.580 --> 01:38:00.499
- What if I doubled what
I gave you last time?

1306
01:38:01.876 --> 01:38:02.710
- No.

1307
01:38:04.837 --> 01:38:06.380
- Okay.

1308
01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:07.673
How about if I tripled it?

1309
01:38:11.594 --> 01:38:15.639
A hundred and fifty grand
buys a few nice rice rockets.

1310
01:38:17.016 --> 01:38:18.559
It's a no brainer. Speed Racer.

1311
01:38:25.316 --> 01:38:26.901
- Okay. sure.

1312
01:38:37.202 --> 01:38:39.204
- Oh. mornin'. hon.

1313
01:38:39.204 --> 01:38:40.039
- Morning.

1314
01:38:41.707 --> 01:38:43.542
How'd you sleep. Mr. Kirk?

1315
01:38:43.542 --> 01:38:45.210
- Tossed and turned all night.

1316
01:38:45.210 --> 01:38:46.545
What about you?

1317
01:38:46.545 --> 01:38:47.379
- Yeah. me too.

1318
01:38:48.672 --> 01:38:49.924
Feelin' a little jittery.

1319
01:38:51.091 --> 01:38:52.426
We'll be all right.

1320
01:38:57.139 --> 01:38:57.973
- Tom?

1321
01:38:58.974 --> 01:38:59.808
- Yep.

1322
01:39:03.938 --> 01:39:04.772
You okay?

1323
01:39:11.236 --> 01:39:16.116
Thank you for everything
you've done for me and my dad.

1324
01:39:17.201 --> 01:39:19.078
I mean. if everything goes. well. if.

1325
01:39:21.580 --> 01:39:23.248
maybe we can do that second date.

1326
01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:26.794
Ya know?

1327
01:39:35.511 --> 01:39:36.637
Hey. Bruno. what's up?

1328
01:39:36.637 --> 01:39:38.097
Hey. Tom. how are you?

1329
01:39:38.097 --> 01:39:39.473
- I'm good.

1330
01:39:39.473 --> 01:39:40.933
You talk to Rocky yet?

1331
01:39:40.933 --> 01:39:42.476
Listen. could
you meet me at the bar

1332
01:39:42.476 --> 01:39:44.311
in about 10 minutes?

1333
01:39:44.311 --> 01:39:45.813
Got something important to discuss.

1334
01:39:45.813 --> 01:39:47.856
- Right now? No. man. I can't.

1335
01:39:47.856 --> 01:39:51.235
It's about Rocky.
I'll see ya there in 10.

1336
01:39:51.235 --> 01:39:53.237
- What was that about?

1337
01:39:53.237 --> 01:39:55.656
- That was Bruno. He wants
me to meet him at the bar.

1338
01:39:56.573 --> 01:39:57.408
- I'm coming.

1339
01:40:26.478 --> 01:40:28.814
- Hey. Tom. How's it goin'?

1340
01:40:28.814 --> 01:40:29.648
- Good.

1341
01:40:29.648 --> 01:40:31.525
- So. I heard you made some
progress on the research.

1342
01:40:31.525 --> 01:40:32.359
- I did.

1343
01:40:34.862 --> 01:40:37.865
- Well. first off. I
really wanna thank you.

1344
01:40:44.997 --> 01:40:46.540
- Yo. what are you?

1345
01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:47.374
- I'm really sorry about this.

1346
01:40:47.374 --> 01:40:49.251
- Bruno. stop!

1347
01:40:49.251 --> 01:40:52.129
- I tried showing you
the good side of life.

1348
01:40:52.129 --> 01:40:54.715
Then you went all Dalai Lama on me.

1349
01:40:54.715 --> 01:40:56.300
- Come on!

1350
01:41:00.596 --> 01:41:05.434
I mean. really. man. how do
you say no to a '66 Vette. huh?

1351
01:41:05.434 --> 01:41:07.644
- You just think you're so...

1352
01:41:07.644 --> 01:41:09.104
Think you're so...

1353
01:41:42.096 --> 01:41:42.930
- Tom!

1354
01:41:44.473 --> 01:41:46.391
Hey. are you okay?

1355
01:41:47.768 --> 01:41:48.894
Tom!

1356
01:41:48.894 --> 01:41:49.728
- That's you.

1357
01:41:51.188 --> 01:41:52.564
Tell her you're almost done!

1358
01:41:54.650 --> 01:41:55.567
- I'm almost done.

1359
01:42:05.077 --> 01:42:05.911
- Okay. okay.

1360
01:42:05.911 --> 01:42:09.206
So. I go back to the farm. I get the Mint.

1361
01:42:09.206 --> 01:42:10.499
and I bring it back to you.

1362
01:42:10.499 --> 01:42:11.333
- That's right.

1363
01:42:11.333 --> 01:42:14.586
And to me and to no one else. okay?

1364
01:42:14.586 --> 01:42:15.671
- Okay. I got it.

1365
01:42:15.671 --> 01:42:17.923
- Okay. now get out of
here before TICS sets it.

1366
01:42:17.923 --> 01:42:18.715
- How?

1367
01:42:18.715 --> 01:42:19.800
- Just check your pockets.

1368
01:42:24.721 --> 01:42:25.597
- Nice.

1369
01:42:34.648 --> 01:42:36.316
- Hey! Tom. hey!

1370
01:42:36.316 --> 01:42:41.321
Where are you going?

1371
01:42:48.871 --> 01:42:51.039
Pick up. pick up. pick up.

1372
01:43:04.553 --> 01:43:06.138
Rocky. this is Bruno.

1373
01:43:06.138 --> 01:43:08.599
I asked Tom to meet me
at the Rusty Tavern.

1374
01:43:08.599 --> 01:43:10.726
I'm waiting outside. Meet me here.

1375
01:43:16.607 --> 01:43:18.275
- Did you call Tom?

1376
01:43:18.275 --> 01:43:19.109
- Yeah.

1377
01:43:20.235 --> 01:43:21.486
When is he coming?

1378
01:43:21.486 --> 01:43:24.364
- He already did. I surrogate loaded him.

1379
01:43:24.364 --> 01:43:27.451
- Really? Nicely done Potter boy.

1380
01:43:29.620 --> 01:43:31.121
- 150Ks isn't gonna cut it.

1381
01:43:32.331 --> 01:43:33.624
I want at least 2 million.

1382
01:43:35.375 --> 01:43:36.210
- Excuse me?

1383
01:43:37.586 --> 01:43:39.087
- You and I both know that a hold time

1384
01:43:39.087 --> 01:43:41.715
that's over 18 hours is worth millions.

1385
01:43:43.675 --> 01:43:44.509
- I see.

1386
01:43:47.304 --> 01:43:48.805
And if I don't pay?

1387
01:43:49.932 --> 01:43:51.391
I'll call the sheik.

1388
01:43:53.227 --> 01:43:54.978
- You think you're smart. huh?

1389
01:43:54.978 --> 01:43:56.563
A real brainiac?

1390
01:43:56.563 --> 01:43:58.440
- I'd like to think so. yeah.

1391
01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:01.360
- Do you know the inferior brain paradox?

1392
01:44:03.904 --> 01:44:06.406
The less it knows. the
more it thinks it knows.

1393
01:44:18.252 --> 01:44:20.754
- My surrogate's never
gonna give you that device.

1394
01:44:21.838 --> 01:44:23.465
- That may be.

1395
01:44:23.465 --> 01:44:24.675
So put your hands there.

1396
01:44:28.971 --> 01:44:31.473
Now. this is what we will use.

1397
01:44:40.357 --> 01:44:41.733
- You selfish pig.

1398
01:44:41.733 --> 01:44:45.028
- Maybe. but you know what
happens with selfless pigs?

1399
01:46:18.914 --> 01:46:19.748
- Howdy.

1400
01:46:30.801 --> 01:46:33.804
Can I get ya anything? A beer maybe?

1401
01:46:38.475 --> 01:46:40.519
What kinda beer is that?

1402
01:46:40.519 --> 01:46:42.354
- It's not a beer. my
.

1403
01:46:42.354 --> 01:46:43.522
it's you.

1404
01:46:43.522 --> 01:46:45.357
You're beautiful.

1405
01:46:45.357 --> 01:46:48.777
Thank you.

1406
01:46:52.155 --> 01:46:54.032
You know. we're inside. right?

1407
01:46:57.285 --> 01:46:59.037
- Thank you.

1408
01:46:59.037 --> 01:47:03.917
- Wow. you have beautiful eyes.

1409
01:47:04.793 --> 01:47:05.877
- I've been told.

1410
01:47:05.877 --> 01:47:07.421
- You have?

1411
01:47:07.421 --> 01:47:08.713
Why am I not surprised.

1412
01:47:10.715 --> 01:47:14.136
Wow. I could just stare into them all day.

1413
01:47:16.888 --> 01:47:18.640
Oh. I'm up here.

1414
01:47:34.990 --> 01:47:36.032
You feelin' okay?

1415
01:47:37.492 --> 01:47:38.326
- You.

1416
01:47:39.327 --> 01:47:42.873
- And you thought you could
get away with killing my Kirk.

1417
01:47:42.873 --> 01:47:43.707
- You.

1418
01:47:47.544 --> 01:47:48.378
- Adios.

1419
01:48:10.484 --> 01:48:11.985
- Okay. where'd you say he is?

1420
01:48:13.153 --> 01:48:14.279
- Outside in his car.

1421
01:48:16.823 --> 01:48:18.116
- Quick. gimme your phone.

1422
01:48:19.284 --> 01:48:20.118
Come on. gimme your phone.

1423
01:48:20.118 --> 01:48:20.952
- Okay.

1424
01:48:26.208 --> 01:48:27.667
- What? We're out of options.

1425
01:48:27.667 --> 01:48:28.793
This is all we've got.

1426
01:48:30.253 --> 01:48:31.046
- I don't know.

1427
01:48:32.464 --> 01:48:33.381
It's risky.

1428
01:48:34.633 --> 01:48:35.634
Look. you don't have to do this.

1429
01:48:35.634 --> 01:48:37.844
Oh. I do. for my dad.

1430
01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:44.768
- I wanna ask you somethin'.

1431
01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:50.941
- What happened to Kirk that night?

1432
01:48:52.943 --> 01:48:54.611
- What's going on?

1433
01:48:54.611 --> 01:48:56.613
Is this TICS setting in?

1434
01:48:56.613 --> 01:48:57.405
- Just tell me.

1435
01:48:58.990 --> 01:49:00.283
- Get back inside.

1436
01:49:01.701 --> 01:49:02.619
- I need answers.

1437
01:49:02.619 --> 01:49:03.745
- I'll go get the Mint.

1438
01:49:03.745 --> 01:49:05.080
- Bruno.
- Just stay put.

1439
01:49:05.956 --> 01:49:06.790
I'm not Bruno.

1440
01:49:06.790 --> 01:49:08.667
- Bruno. wait. Bruno. wait!

1441
01:49:11.628 --> 01:49:14.047
- Hey! Hey. what happened?

1442
01:49:14.047 --> 01:49:15.674
- We gotta get to the farm now.

1443
01:49:15.674 --> 01:49:16.550
- How?

1444
01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:17.926
- Get in.
- Okay.

1445
01:49:45.870 --> 01:49:47.789
911. state your emergency.

1446
01:49:47.789 --> 01:49:49.791
- Hi. I'd like to report
a possible shooting

1447
01:49:49.791 --> 01:49:51.751
at Blue Mountain Farms in Elgin.

1448
01:49:52.711 --> 01:49:54.296
Sir. are you safe?

1449
01:49:54.296 --> 01:49:55.505
- Yes.

1450
01:49:55.505 --> 01:49:57.591
Do you need medical-

1451
01:50:12.814 --> 01:50:14.190
- What are you doing here?

1452
01:50:14.190 --> 01:50:15.650
Why aren't you at the bar?

1453
01:50:15.650 --> 01:50:17.569
- I need to ask you something.

1454
01:50:17.569 --> 01:50:19.863
- I don't have time
for this. Just go back.

1455
01:50:19.863 --> 01:50:22.657
- Tell me this one thing and
I'll do whatever you want.

1456
01:50:22.657 --> 01:50:24.034
You've got to be kidding me.

1457
01:50:24.034 --> 01:50:26.286
- What did you to Kirk?

1458
01:50:26.286 --> 01:50:28.496
- This is what you want to know right now?

1459
01:50:28.496 --> 01:50:30.999
- What happened to Kirk that night?

1460
01:50:30.999 --> 01:50:31.833
- Okay. okay.

1461
01:50:33.752 --> 01:50:37.047
I asked Bruno to surrogate load
onto Tom to steal the Mint.

1462
01:50:37.047 --> 01:50:39.633
He ran into Dr. Kirk.
panicked. and killed him.

1463
01:50:44.137 --> 01:50:46.056
- You killed Dr. Kirk Davis?

1464
01:50:46.056 --> 01:50:47.140
- No. no. not me.

1465
01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:49.100
Bruno did.

1466
01:50:59.861 --> 01:51:03.281
- What are you doing here? We had a deal.

1467
01:51:05.909 --> 01:51:07.327
- Gimme the laptop and files.

1468
01:51:08.662 --> 01:51:10.163
- No. no. no. give them to me.

1469
01:51:15.001 --> 01:51:16.002
- Wait. who are you?

1470
01:51:17.379 --> 01:51:19.714
- I don't have time to play who's who?

1471
01:51:19.714 --> 01:51:22.884
Give me the laptop.
Goddamn it. we had a plan!

1472
01:51:25.804 --> 01:51:28.473
- Okay. if I can't reason with you.

1473
01:51:28.473 --> 01:51:30.225
then maybe you'll reason with this.

1474
01:51:33.395 --> 01:51:36.856
Give me the laptop or
I'll blow your brains out.

1475
01:51:58.128 --> 01:52:00.630
- Get back. step back. Step back!

1476
01:52:03.550 --> 01:52:05.760
- Look. look. look. Rocky. I'm sorry.

1477
01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:06.970
I shouldn't have asked for more money.

1478
01:52:06.970 --> 01:52:09.806
We can just keep the original
deal and I'll walk away.

1479
01:52:09.806 --> 01:52:13.643
- No. no more deals. Give me
the laptop and my body back.

1480
01:52:15.645 --> 01:52:16.479
- Tom?

1481
01:52:19.482 --> 01:52:22.610
I had nothing to do with this. okay.

1482
01:52:22.610 --> 01:52:24.446
He killed your father.

1483
01:52:24.446 --> 01:52:27.073
I promise if you let me go
you'll never see me again.

1484
01:52:27.073 --> 01:52:27.866
I'll disappear.

1485
01:52:30.994 --> 01:52:33.163
- You sleazy worm. Come here.

1486
01:52:34.748 --> 01:52:36.750
- Wait. wait. wait. wait. wait.

1487
01:52:36.750 --> 01:52:37.834
We can still get outta this.

1488
01:52:37.834 --> 01:52:38.668
- How?

1489
01:52:38.668 --> 01:52:41.212
- The phone. It's in my pocket.

1490
01:52:41.212 --> 01:52:43.965
And the cops are on
their way. Do the math!

1491
01:52:54.559 --> 01:52:56.811
We have him dead to rights.

1492
01:52:57.687 --> 01:52:58.980
Know this. my boy.

1493
01:52:58.980 --> 01:53:02.275
As you go. so goes your father's work.

1494
01:53:02.275 --> 01:53:05.111
Mad lab assistant kills scientist father.

1495
01:53:05.111 --> 01:53:07.447
Sentenced to life.

1496
01:53:09.866 --> 01:53:13.787
Every second. of every
minute of every hour

1497
01:53:13.787 --> 01:53:15.580
of every day your father devoted his life

1498
01:53:15.580 --> 01:53:17.415
to memory transfer technology.

1499
01:53:17.415 --> 01:53:22.295
It goes away with you.

1500
01:53:22.295 --> 01:53:23.880
- Drop your weapon.

1501
01:53:23.880 --> 01:53:24.714
Drop it now!

1502
01:53:26.049 --> 01:53:26.925
Drop your weapon.

1503
01:53:27.884 --> 01:53:30.386
That'll be your legacy.

1504
01:53:30.386 --> 01:53:32.096
- Hey. I said I'll shoot.

1505
01:53:32.096 --> 01:53:34.474
- Oh. you're smarter than that. Tom.

1506
01:53:34.474 --> 01:53:35.433
You won't shoot yourself.

1507
01:53:35.433 --> 01:53:37.811
- You're only as good as
the promises you make.

1508
01:53:39.729 --> 01:53:42.273
And I promised my father
I'd continue his research.

1509
01:53:43.483 --> 01:53:44.442
- Drop your weapon!

1510
01:53:45.443 --> 01:53:46.236
- Shoot me.

1511
01:53:48.154 --> 01:53:49.489
Kill yourself.

1512
01:53:52.534 --> 01:53:55.495
Face it. you can't kill yourself. Tom.

1513
01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:00.458
I can't shoot you. but...

1514
01:54:05.463 --> 01:54:06.714
- Step away from the weapon.

1515
01:54:06.714 --> 01:54:08.466
Drop it. step away. step away.

1516
01:54:08.466 --> 01:54:10.051
Get down. Get down. get down. get down.

1517
01:54:10.051 --> 01:54:12.262
- No. no. no. no. no. No.

1518
01:54:12.262 --> 01:54:15.014
- Get down!

1519
01:54:15.014 --> 01:54:17.517
- No. no. no. no. no.

1520
01:54:17.517 --> 01:54:18.351
No! No!

1521
01:54:19.769 --> 01:54:21.729
I got him. son. I got him.

1522
01:54:21.729 --> 01:54:22.564
- No!

1523
01:54:31.281 --> 01:54:32.740
An eye for an eye.

1524
01:55:05.690 --> 01:55:07.191
Birthday. bud.

1525
01:55:07.191 --> 01:55:08.026
- Bruno!

1526
01:55:08.026 --> 01:55:08.902
- Bruno!

1527
01:55:08.902 --> 01:55:10.111
- Sorry for everything.

1528
01:55:10.111 --> 01:55:12.196
This is your
brain in digital form.

1529
01:55:15.408 --> 01:55:16.534
Tom. are you okay?

1530
01:55:16.534 --> 01:55:17.952
Dr. Davis.

1531
01:55:17.952 --> 01:55:19.120
Tom.

1532
01:57:01.931 --> 01:57:06.936
between father and son

1533
01:57:07.145 --> 01:57:12.150
and the kingdom come

1534
01:57:12.859 --> 01:57:17.864
till it makes me numb

1535
01:57:33.379 --> 01:57:37.300
sure will be his last

1536
01:57:48.561 --> 01:57:52.273
has now grown numb

1537
01:58:28.643 --> 01:58:32.814
my fists clenched tight

1538
01:58:39.904 --> 01:58:44.033
close to the borderline

1539
01:59:02.343 --> 01:59:06.514
born and a time to die

1540
01:59:17.400 --> 01:59:21.404
war and a time for peace

1541
01:59:21.404 --> 01:59:25.032
and a time to speak

1542
01:59:25.032 --> 01:59:28.870
gain and a time to lose

1543
01:59:28.870 --> 01:59:32.456
and it's time to choose

1544
01:59:36.127 --> 01:59:39.964
and a time to mourn

1545
01:59:39.964 --> 01:59:43.843
and a time to build

1546
01:59:51.434 --> 01:59:55.021
when he's been outgunned
