00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.960
NARRATOR: Lang Lang is a unique artist
and certainly a unique classical artist.

5
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.200
because this guy has superpowers.

6
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.640
The highest echelon
of classical piano playing.

7
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.120
Lang Lang at an early age. like. three.
was already playing the piano.

8
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.680
And he had all the world's
greatest piano literature

9
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.720
to fill his days and his soul.

10
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.160
There's a stereotype
of a classical pianist.

11
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.040
staid and composed and proper.

12
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.160
but Lang Lang. he's more like a rock star.

13
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.120
With Lang Lang.
there's always another chapter.

14
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.520
and another level.
and another form of expression.

15
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.360
He wanted to do these famous songs
from Disney.

16
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.720
A lot of these songs
he knew them in his heart.

17
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.920
They meant something to him.

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.920
So when you combine that
with the world's greatest piano player.

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.240
it's like fireworks.

20
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.720
(melodic music playing)

21
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.760
It's a big production.
(chuckles)

22
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.040
NARRATOR:
Combining Lang Lang and Disney songs.

23
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.320
and the Royal Albert Hall
is like the Holy Grail.

24
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.840
The architecture of the building.
the history of the building.

25
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.240
This is a special environment.

26
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.360
Let's go.

27
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.040
NARRATOR: The music rising from the stage
and the orchestra.

28
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.640
everybody dressed to the nines
and playing their hearts out.

29
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.640
For a moment. music carries you away
to this other place.

(audience applauding)

31
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.920
LANG LANG: Thank you.

32
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.200
Thank you very much. Beautiful.

33
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.640
How are you?

34
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.480

MAN: Mark hit.

42
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.200
As a kid. I actually had a very tough
practicing process.

43
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.320
MOMENTO FROM 4 MONTHS OLD

44
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.280
RON: Those early years for him
were very. very challenging.

45
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.120
there's a lot of piano competitions.
there's a lot of pressure.

46
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.920
a lot of pressure on a young boy.

47
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.200
In this new generation.
everybody has a lot of. uh.

48
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.600
you know. hobbies.

49
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.400
LANG LANG: But when I was a kid.
I... I maybe more focused in music.

50
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.720
He's always very passionate.
and he's always very authentic.

51
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.240
His story. really kind of reflects also
a lot of Disney values.

52
00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.800
GINA: To believe in your dreams.
and also to always stay brave.

53
00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.080
to take challenges and risks.

54
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.720
and mostly important.
um. to have a good heart.

55
00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.240
I did a lot of practicing.

56
00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.160
and. uh. I think I did six hours
when I was six years old.

57
00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:04.480
because I had to go through
all those major. minor keys of scales.

58
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.840
arpeggios. chords. octave.

59
00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:14.760
and then I get into the music pieces
from Bach. Mozart. to Chinese folk music.

60
00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.720
So every day. I actually only have.
like. 30 minutes to watch. uh. television.

61
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.400
and then I use that 30 minutes
to watch cartoons.

62
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.640
LANG LANG: Mickey Mouse.
Donald Duck. Goofy. you know.

63
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.400
all those great characters.

64
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:31.720
This great animation.
you know. inspired me.

65
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:37.520
helping me to understand life.
helping me to learn different cultures.

66
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.560
it's also an escape
from my hard practicing.

67
00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:46.160
my magic carpet. you know.
for 30 minutes every day.

68
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.600
Classical music's part of the success
of Disney films.

69
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.280
The music style of Disney

70
00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.800
has to be passionate.
touching people's hearts.

71
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.440
it has to be emotional.

72
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:07.160
After Lang Lang became a father.
his heart became stronger.

73
00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.720
and softer at the same time.

74
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:13.800
LANG LANG: Something really changes me
is when I'm having my first kid.

75
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.800
Once I started playing Tarzan.
I found that. through him.

76
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.120
a new Disney journey just start.

77
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.640
and I felt more connected
to the character.

78
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.560

(serene music playing)

126
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.680
In our world. classical music world.
there always a danger.

127
00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.240
like. how far you can go.

128
00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:27.320
Sometimes in classical musical world.
we're so comfortable.

129
00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.800
You know why?
Because every repertoire we play

130
00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.480
is already existing for 200 years.

131
00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:37.920
If you look into the Hollywood.
if you look into. uh. popular culture.

132
00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.200
if they don't create something new.
they're out.

133
00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:45.880
They're absolutely out.
nobody will remember them in five years.

134
00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.360
Yeah. so... so that's a huge difference.

135
00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:54.000
We have to communicate
and we have to make some sound.

136
00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.960
He loves creating visions
and new journeys.

137
00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.640
One day he plays
Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto.

138
00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.840
the next day he plays Bach's
Goldberg Variations.

139
00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:09.360
GINA: And then next week.
he plays a beautiful Disney program.

140
00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:13.160
So I think it's very fascinating
that he can connect these worlds.

141
00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:16.680
He can make very complex
and intellectual music.

142
00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.560
like. approachable to everyone.

143
00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:23.200
And he can connect people's hearts
through music.

144
00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:30.840
Disney music had this magic power
to take the audience into a fantasy world.

145
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:39.520
When you have all those melodies.
this is really not just from one culture.

146
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.480
You have Mulan from China.

147
00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.720
you have Aladdin from the Middle East.

148
00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:49.360
You have Encanto from Colombia.
or Coco from Mexico.

149
00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:54.200
You have a lot of European fairy tales.
American-based stories.

150
00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:57.880
You just kind of get your eyes open.

151
00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:03.360
This is the way we should. you know.
kind of try to understand music.

152
00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.000
I'm trying to get out
from the comfort zone.

153
00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:10.240
to create something together
with spectacular Disney music.

154
00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:14.280
but in a classical music style.
to approach new audience.

155
00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.200
and to give them new story to tell.

156
00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.760

Can we just practice one more place
before...

164
00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:09.080
I... I mean. the hard place.

165
00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.760
For me. it's a bit too slow.

166
00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:13.160
(vocalizing)

167
00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.800

(harmonizing)

169
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000
So like the first two hours…

170
00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.360
HENRY: Lang Lang is just a person who...

171
00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:26.440
He's on a different wavelength.

172
00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:30.280
He's floating on a cloud.
he's picking things out of the universe.

173
00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.280
and flying on the magic carpet.

174
00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.880
and allowing himself
to. like. go into this world.

175
00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.560
Like-- He doesn't restrain himself.

176
00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:39.240
I think that's a little unusual
for classical music

177
00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:43.120
where the notes and the ink rule the day.

178
00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.640
-That was beautiful.
-MAN: That was beautiful.

179
00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.080
-LANG LANG: Okay. Reflection.
-MAN: Reflection.

180
00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:53.200
One of the challenge of this project
is actually quite hard one.

181
00:28:53.280 --> 00:29:00.120
How to make already existing
great melodies from Disney films itself

182
00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.720
into a pianistic work with orchestra?

183
00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:05.920
Do you want that a little--
Is that a little held in tempo?

184
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.080
-LANG LANG: Uh. D. yeah? One second.
-Yeah. After the…

185
00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.720
(vocalizing)

186
00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:15.080
-Maybe from those octaves. yeah?
-Yeah. sure. Three bars before.

187
00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.240
We knew that we wanted to do
these famous songs from Disney.

188
00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:22.240
And the question.
with an artist like Lang Lang. is.

189
00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.840
his level of approaching the piano
is it's so highly evolved.

190
00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.880
the highest echelon
of classical piano playing.

191
00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.840
What do you give
to the world's greatest piano player

192
00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.280
to convey these songs and these melodies?

193
00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:38.560
LANG LANG: We were very lucky to work
with. uh. many of the greatest

194
00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.720
piano arranger in the world.

195
00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.000
You have to re-write a lot of things.

196
00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:46.040
We actually have the rhythm.
we have the harmony.

197
00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.000
we have the arpeggios.

198
00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.680
we have the octaves.

199
00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:53.200
You can feel this is a real chamber music.

200
00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:55.520
This is a... a piano concerto.

201
00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:59.280
And that gave me the great joy to do it.

202
00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:03.760
So. what you do is. probably.
you cut. like. here. remember?

203
00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.240
(soft melody playing)

204
00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:12.160
Wow. that was...
That is a powerful rehearsal.

205
00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:16.640
I see how much heart and spirit
and soul he puts into this project.

206
00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:21.880
and. um. to find great musicians
to collaborate with. to find composers.

207
00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:26.280
to find the best and unique
and virtuoso. um. arrangements.

208
00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:27.920
to make people happy.

209
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.560
and to let everyone enjoy the beauty
of Disney music.

210
00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:35.440
His thing really is to convey emotion
through the piano.

211
00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:39.160
Now when you match that up
with this incredible technical facility

212
00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.200
where every option is open to him.

213
00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:44.000
it's like the ten fingers add up
to a hundred.

214
00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:48.040
The bar is set so high.
so thought through.

215
00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:50.160
and it all comes down to storytelling.

216
00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:53.960
LANG LANG:
Piano has to be absolutely there.

217
00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:56.040
fairy tale style playing.

218
00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:59.720
All those delicacy technique. light. fast.

219
00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:03.120
Technique has to serve music
hundred percent.

220
00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.000
And if that's too much. we have to cut.

221
00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:08.800
It's not-- This is not just making
some kind of a look.

222
00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.240
you know. kind of a gimmick that.

223
00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.400
"Hey. look.
my hand is all over the place."

224
00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:16.040
One may need the hands
to be all over the place.

225
00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.800
we have to be there. right?

226
00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:21.240
But if we don't need it.
if it's too much. we have to cut.

227
00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:22.960
We have to serve music.

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:42.480
So let's have some fun
with your music first.

244
00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.600
and then we go from there. okay?

245
00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.200
We know through all the years

246
00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:50.040
what kind of effect music has
on children's lives.

247
00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:54.400
GINA: Some of the children

248
00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:58.800
don't necessarily
have the opportunity to get close

249
00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:03.280
and to get in contact with music
and to learn an instrument.

250
00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.880
So what Lang Lang does since 2008 already.

251
00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:08.280
he started his foundation in 2008.

252
00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:10.240
is to go into public schools

253
00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:14.240
where music is actually not
in the curriculum anymore.

254
00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:18.240
Normally. I like to... to visit. uh.
the schools everywhere I go.

255
00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:24.000
We have around 100 schools
around the world. in China. in the U.S..

256
00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.840
and now we're coming to Europe.

257
00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:29.560
And it's quite important
that we support the kid to learn music.

258
00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:35.640
particularly at the more
disadvantaged area in the city.

259
00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.200
So I play the bass line
and then you can...

260
00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:43.920
(vocalizing)

261
00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:45.840
Good. good. good.

262
00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:49.200
I'm getting tired of looking
into the schools.

263
00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:52.640
you know. going there only once
in our lifetime.

264
00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:57.280
and then we're happy about it.
but actually. you didn't really help much.

265
00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:59.920
LANG LANG: After a musician's gone.
they are back to normal.

266
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.720
No music class. We need to take action.

267
00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:07.680
Really get deep into the school system.

268
00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:12.720
Our aim is to improve our education tools.

269
00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:17.360
We always have the smart digital pianos
in one class.

270
00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:20.160
20 to 30. uh. digital pianos.

271
00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:26.680
Each kid not only listening to the class.
but they have the possibility to play.

272
00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:29.080
That's the aim.
Yeah. you have to touch the keys.

273
00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:34.320
(students murmuring)

274
00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:38.120
Every time when I'm visiting a school.

275
00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:41.280
the kids always ask me.
"Hey. can you play some Disney music?"

276
00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:46.240
After The Disney Book.
I'm much more equipped.

277
00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:50.680
I think now it's so much more fun
with the. you know. the repertoire I know.

278
00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:52.080
and to share with the kid.

279
00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.960
And also ask them to learn.

280
00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:55.040
GINA: So many children.

281
00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:58.920
they love so much more of going to school
because of those music classes.

282
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.520
And it builds their confidence.

283
00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.480
and they can achieve their dreams
through music

284
00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:06.760
because they see that they're strong.

285
00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:09.360
It's all inside of them already.

286
00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:13.080
It just needs this spark.
this chance to come out.

287
00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:18.440
Music is the most fair.
should be the most fair art form.
