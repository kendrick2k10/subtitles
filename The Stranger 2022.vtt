<i>Close your eyes…</i>

4
00:02:11.875 --> 00:02:13.958
<i>…and place your attention on your breath.</i>

5
00:02:16.666 --> 00:02:17.958
<i>Breathe in…</i>

6
00:02:20.083 --> 00:02:21.166
<i>and out.</i>

7
00:02:24.166 --> 00:02:27.833
<i>Just put your attention on the breath</i>
<i>coming into your body as you inhale.</i>

8
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.500
<i>It's clear.</i>

9
00:02:33.416 --> 00:02:34.625
<i>Nothing.</i>

10
00:02:36.333 --> 00:02:38.125
<i>And as you breathe out…</i>

11
00:02:39.458 --> 00:02:41.458
<i>…the air</i>
<i>that comes out of you is black.</i>

12
00:02:42.375 --> 00:02:45.625
<i>And that black is any anxiety. stress.</i>

13
00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:48.083
<i>any worries that you carry.</i>

14
00:02:50.291 --> 00:02:52.708
<i>And as you breathe out.</i>
<i>feel it leave your body.</i>

15
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.208
<i>Breathe in clear air</i>
<i>and breathe out the black.</i>

16
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.916
<i>Breathe in clear air.</i>

17
00:03:03.708 --> 00:03:04.583
<i>Breathe out--</i>

18
00:04:26.708 --> 00:04:28.416
There I am standing

19
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.708
in front of this old
nothing house. staring at it.

20
00:04:33.375 --> 00:04:34.958
and this bloke comes over.

21
00:04:35.666 --> 00:04:37.958
And I recognize him. you know?

22
00:04:38.041 --> 00:04:40.333
Older. but I recognize him.

23
00:04:40.416 --> 00:04:44.000
I said. "It's me. Paul Emery.
I used to live in that house."

24
00:04:47.208 --> 00:04:49.875
And he goes. "No. No. you didn't."

25
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
I said. "You're Chris."

26
00:04:57.291 --> 00:05:01.291
"Chris. You had that German Shepherd."
He says. "How did you know that?"

27
00:05:03.291 --> 00:05:06.000
"We lived in this house for years."

28
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.666
-This old fellow--
-You heading to WA for work?

29
00:05:12.291 --> 00:05:13.708
No.

30
00:05:15.333 --> 00:05:17.000
Never actually been there before.

31
00:05:17.875 --> 00:05:18.875
Yourself?

32
00:05:19.666 --> 00:05:21.791
Home. Headed home.

33
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.333
No. I just had to. uh. clear out…

34
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.916
Clear out of Queensland.

35
00:05:34.916 --> 00:05:37.000
Sort myself a car.

36
00:05:37.083 --> 00:05:39.291
Some place to stay and that.

37
00:05:43.291 --> 00:05:44.333
I'm Paul.

38
00:05:47.875 --> 00:05:48.708
Henry.

39
00:06:08.416 --> 00:06:09.791
Turn her off again.

40
00:06:11.458 --> 00:06:12.333
And again.

41
00:06:16.125 --> 00:06:17.583
Yeah. Let's hear her. mate.

42
00:06:24.833 --> 00:06:27.208
I need an address for
the transfer of ownership.

43
00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:28.833
Yeah.

44
00:06:30.583 --> 00:06:33.333
-I can put down a motel?
-I don't know about that.

45
00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:37.416
-That's where I'm living. A motel.
-Can't put down a motel.

46
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.375
I've got a PO box you can use.
put that down while he sorts himself out.

47
00:06:41.458 --> 00:06:42.625
-Okay.
-Thanks.

48
00:06:44.041 --> 00:06:45.125
Thanks. Henry.

49
00:06:45.833 --> 00:06:46.708
All right.

50
00:06:48.416 --> 00:06:49.333
$1.600.

51
00:06:54.041 --> 00:06:55.791
-Here. mate. That's for you.
-Nah.

52
00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.708
Come on. mate.
I mean. you really helped me out.

53
00:07:00.875 --> 00:07:02.625
No.

54
00:07:05.041 --> 00:07:07.041
What do you do for work. Henry?

55
00:07:07.583 --> 00:07:09.666
Everything I know is in my hands.

56
00:07:10.166 --> 00:07:11.750
Can't hardly work now though.

57
00:07:11.833 --> 00:07:13.666
I'll be fucked in a few years' time.

58
00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:15.625
And why's that?

59
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.250
Can't fuckin' breathe. mate.

60
00:07:19.791 --> 00:07:22.458
I know what it's like to be
on the other side of things.

61
00:07:23.375 --> 00:07:26.291
You got your last few fuckin' dollars
in an envelope there.

62
00:07:27.375 --> 00:07:28.708
I see it all over you.

63
00:07:42.166 --> 00:07:43.375
Paul Emery?

64
00:07:47.833 --> 00:07:50.750
<i>I can't. uh.</i>
<i>take your call at the moment.</i>

65
00:07:50.833 --> 00:07:54.333
<i>If you leave me a message.</i>
<i>I'll endeavor to call you back later.</i>

66
00:07:55.458 --> 00:07:56.458
Henry. it's Paul.

67
00:07:57.291 --> 00:07:59.208
I need to talk to you about something.

68
00:07:59.708 --> 00:08:01.750
I might need to shift out of the motel.

69
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.208
So give us a ring back when you get this.

70
00:08:06.333 --> 00:08:07.291
Okay. Talk soon.

71
00:08:17.083 --> 00:08:21.458
So it's just a bit further up here.
There's a house. You can drop me off.

72
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:25.791
All right. I have to tell you. Henry…

73
00:08:26.791 --> 00:08:30.625
I came out here
to do a job for some people.

74
00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:33.625
And there's a mate of mine.

75
00:08:34.458 --> 00:08:38.208
Mark. He asked me if I knew anyone
who could handle a bit of work.

76
00:08:38.916 --> 00:08:40.291
I talked to him about you.

77
00:08:41.708 --> 00:08:43.291
Yeah. just here is good.

78
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.250
Yeah. this is good. Just here.

79
00:08:55.333 --> 00:08:56.416
What kind of work?

80
00:08:57.666 --> 00:08:59.125
I have to let him tell ya.

81
00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:01.875
I don't do violence.

82
00:09:03.041 --> 00:09:06.333
No. Henry. come on. It's not like that.

83
00:09:07.791 --> 00:09:10.750
We'll meet him tomorrow.
He'll tell you all about it.

84
00:09:14.833 --> 00:09:16.041
Have you dyed your hair?

85
00:09:18.125 --> 00:09:19.000
What?

86
00:09:20.208 --> 00:09:21.541
Have you dyed your hair?

87
00:09:24.291 --> 00:09:26.125
Yeah. I just went a bit darker.

88
00:09:32.708 --> 00:09:34.000
It looks good.

89
00:09:36.541 --> 00:09:37.375
Thanks.

90
00:09:39.541 --> 00:09:40.708
Tell him we're on.

91
00:09:42.291 --> 00:09:43.166
Yep.

92
00:09:45.875 --> 00:09:49.750
Great. I'll see you tomorrow.
Thanks for the lift.

93
00:10:19.208 --> 00:10:21.416
-Where's Paul?
-He couldn't make it.

94
00:10:23.458 --> 00:10:24.458
Get in.

95
00:10:28.208 --> 00:10:29.125
Get in.

96
00:10:37.458 --> 00:10:38.625
Put your seatbelt on.

97
00:10:43.875 --> 00:10:44.958
I don't do violence.

98
00:10:47.166 --> 00:10:48.958
No. I've heard.

99
00:11:18.708 --> 00:11:21.541
Fat cunt.

100
00:11:23.833 --> 00:11:25.416
What are we doing here?

101
00:11:25.916 --> 00:11:26.791
Wait here.

102
00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:31.916
How you doin'. Mark? Good?

103
00:11:34.041 --> 00:11:35.375
Why'd you call me?

104
00:11:35.458 --> 00:11:37.541
Look. I've got your passports ready.

105
00:11:37.625 --> 00:11:41.375
They're all clean and unmarked.
And I'm so sorry I couldn't get the money.

106
00:11:41.666 --> 00:11:43.833
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be sorry. Why?

107
00:11:43.916 --> 00:11:45.375
I tried everything I could.

108
00:11:45.458 --> 00:11:47.583
-But--
-I'll get it for you Tuesday.

109
00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.458
By the way.
there's a girl shifting gear around

110
00:11:53.541 --> 00:11:55.291
out of Central Massage.

111
00:11:55.375 --> 00:11:56.250
Who?

112
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:58.041
You remember Letessia?

113
00:11:58.583 --> 00:12:00.166
-Who?
-Letessia.

114
00:12:00.583 --> 00:12:01.750
Oh. yeah. yeah.

115
00:12:02.041 --> 00:12:03.875
She's dealing out of the rooms.

116
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.125
-Next week. Ken.
-12:00 sharp?

117
00:12:07.208 --> 00:12:10.250
-What will you do? Thank you.
-Get your money.

118
00:12:10.333 --> 00:12:12.250
No carparks from now on. Fuck.

119
00:12:20.916 --> 00:12:23.041
Shift around gear. Is that it?

120
00:12:23.125 --> 00:12:24.625
No. we don't fuckin' touch it.

121
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.208
You don't use when you work with us. okay?

122
00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:34.708
I've heard that you don't have
many acquaintances. which is good for us.

123
00:12:36.791 --> 00:12:37.750
Works well.

124
00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:40.875
'Cause you don't discuss
this work with anyone.

125
00:12:41.458 --> 00:12:42.458
Open that.

126
00:12:54.333 --> 00:12:55.208
It's blank.

127
00:13:05.708 --> 00:13:07.083
It's just here.

128
00:13:10.375 --> 00:13:16.000
You know.
he's in. uh. trouble. Old mate. Paul.

129
00:13:16.875 --> 00:13:19.000
That's why they had to bring him out here.

130
00:13:20.583 --> 00:13:21.458
What's wrong?

131
00:13:21.541 --> 00:13:24.458
If he contacts you and it's not
through me. just let me know.

132
00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:29.125
Don't you go tell Paul
what I said about him.

133
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.208
Where's your place?

134
00:13:49.541 --> 00:13:51.000
Little piece of fluff.

135
00:13:53.416 --> 00:13:54.291
Thanks.

136
00:14:29.583 --> 00:14:33.333
One. two. three. four. five.

137
00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:38.083
I'm a sworn member
of the Western Australian Police.

138
00:14:38.166 --> 00:14:41.333
conducting duties
at the Undercover Crimes Unit

139

141
00:14:49.875 --> 00:14:53.208
Today's date is May 6. 2010.

142
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.000
My CO number is 452

143
00:14:57.083 --> 00:15:00.791
and I'm using the assumed name
of Mark Frame.

144
00:15:13.458 --> 00:15:15.583
<i>Old mate. he called me last night.</i>

145
00:15:15.708 --> 00:15:18.416
<i>I let it go to voicemail</i>
<i>like… like you said.</i>

146
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.833
Uh. he wanted me to. uh.
to collect this. though.

147
00:15:22.625 --> 00:15:23.833
Yeah. I'll take that.

148
00:15:23.916 --> 00:15:26.041
He's at a property
out of town for a while.

149
00:15:28.791 --> 00:15:29.916
What?

150
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.750
I thought I saw a car.

151
00:15:32.583 --> 00:15:33.708
What'd it look like?

152
00:15:34.375 --> 00:15:36.208
Ah. it's a van. It's turned off now.

153
00:15:40.208 --> 00:15:41.791
Hey. just hold on a sec.

154
00:16:03.416 --> 00:16:04.625
All right. Henry?

155
00:16:06.458 --> 00:16:08.000
Have you seen the sea?

156
00:16:12.875 --> 00:16:13.750
Hey.

157
00:16:17.166 --> 00:16:18.125
Hey. Gary.

158
00:16:18.208 --> 00:16:22.041
-This. um. came for Paul yesterday.

159
00:16:23.041 --> 00:16:24.000
Henry.

160
00:16:25.416 --> 00:16:26.458
Come here.

161
00:16:26.541 --> 00:16:28.416
This is Henry Teague.

162
00:16:29.541 --> 00:16:30.750
That's Gary.

163
00:16:34.166 --> 00:16:36.250
You can't come in here dressed like that.

164
00:16:37.166 --> 00:16:38.958
Get yourself some proper clothes.

165
00:16:39.791 --> 00:16:41.666
You look like a fuckin' criminal.

166
00:16:42.791 --> 00:16:45.416
Seriously. sort it out. Sit down.

167
00:16:52.208 --> 00:16:53.458
About Paul.

168
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
He has issues in the past
and we have to resettle him.

169
00:16:58.750 --> 00:16:59.958
That creates an opening.

170
00:17:00.833 --> 00:17:02.333
We're a closed group.

171
00:17:02.458 --> 00:17:04.375
We don't often let people in.

172
00:17:04.458 --> 00:17:07.541
and when we do. we take care of our own.

173
00:17:10.458 --> 00:17:12.250
How's that sound to you. Henry?

174
00:17:14.083 --> 00:17:16.375
Yeah. why… Yeah. why not?

175
00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:28.875
Look. Mark. I don't have enough money
to buy new clothes. mate.

176
00:17:29.041 --> 00:17:33.500
-I can't fuckin' afford that. you know--
-Ah. mate. Mate. shh. listen. Here. Look.

177
00:17:35.708 --> 00:17:37.125
Yeah. don't worry about it.

178
00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.666
I'll look after you.

179
00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:45.583
See?

180
00:17:46.375 --> 00:17:48.125
Wait. I've gotta ask you something.

181
00:17:48.791 --> 00:17:53.208
That fella up there. Gary.
all right. he's the head here. okay?

182
00:17:53.291 --> 00:17:57.416
But there are people who he answers to
and they answer to people above them.

183
00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:00.333
But he told me to ask you
if you'd done time before.

184
00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:04.708
Yeah. I have. yeah.

185
00:18:04.791 --> 00:18:05.958
Mm-hmm. What for?

186
00:18:06.041 --> 00:18:09.208
Been in and out
a few times. nothing serious.

187
00:18:09.291 --> 00:18:10.916
So no longer stints then?

188
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.291
I did time for an assault
up in the NT. okay?

189
00:18:16.375 --> 00:18:20.541
That's why no fucking violence. you know.
because of the time for repeat offenders.

190
00:18:20.625 --> 00:18:23.875
If you've done longer stints.
just fuckin' tell me. okay?

191
00:18:23.958 --> 00:18:26.250
Don't wait for me to ask you.
How long for?

192
00:18:28.416 --> 00:18:29.583
Two years.

193
00:18:30.708 --> 00:18:33.333
It was at a family crisis center
and there was this fella

194
00:18:33.416 --> 00:18:36.208
who kept chattin' about my
fuckin' missus all the time.

195
00:18:38.333 --> 00:18:39.250
I went for him.

196
00:18:39.333 --> 00:18:41.541
He ran off into the trees.
I went after him.

197
00:18:41.625 --> 00:18:44.500
Yeah. I don't fuck--
I don't care what you done. okay?

198
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.250
What I care about is
you being honest with me.

199
00:18:48.375 --> 00:18:49.625
Yeah. Be honest with me.

200
00:18:51.625 --> 00:18:53.583
That's all I ask. mate. serious. Here.

201
00:18:56.125 --> 00:18:57.125
Cheers.

202
00:18:59.000 --> 00:18:59.916
What?

203
00:19:01.708 --> 00:19:04.666
Just… Nothin'. man. All right.

204
00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:05.708
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

205
00:19:17.083 --> 00:19:18.166
Oi!

206
00:19:19.041 --> 00:19:20.500
What did you do?

207
00:19:21.833 --> 00:19:23.500
Get off the fuckin' table. Get--

208
00:19:23.583 --> 00:19:25.041
Here. Oh. whoa. whoa. whoa.

209
00:19:25.125 --> 00:19:28.291
Come here. Sit on the-- Stand there.

210
00:19:28.375 --> 00:19:29.750
You've got bare feet.

211
00:19:30.666 --> 00:19:32.875
-What did you do that for?
-I didn't mean it.

212
00:19:33.541 --> 00:19:34.666
Fuckin' hell.

213
00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:36.500
Can you just pay attention?

214
00:19:37.125 --> 00:19:39.625
All right?
If I cut myself. whose fault is it?

215
00:19:47.083 --> 00:19:47.916
Fuck.

216
00:19:49.791 --> 00:19:51.458
What are you gonna do next time?

217
00:19:51.958 --> 00:19:54.125
-Clean it up.
-No. pay attention.

218
00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:56.958
All right. Come here.

219
00:19:57.791 --> 00:19:59.083
Listen. Look at me.

220
00:19:59.208 --> 00:20:01.958
Sorry I sweared at you. all right?
Go put your shoes on.

221
00:20:20.875 --> 00:20:24.083
<i>Hey. you want me to</i>
<i>teach you something I learned at work?</i>

222
00:20:25.208 --> 00:20:28.500
<i>Okay. you gotta close your eyes. yeah?</i>

223
00:20:28.583 --> 00:20:31.333
<i>Close your eyes and you gotta breathe in.</i>

224
00:20:31.916 --> 00:20:33.125
<i>and when you breathe in.</i>

225
00:20:34.083 --> 00:20:37.875
<i>you're gonna imagine that</i>
<i>you're breathing in really clear air.</i>

226
00:20:37.958 --> 00:20:39.333
You gonna get out in a sec?

227
00:20:40.375 --> 00:20:42.541
<i>And then when you breathe out. you're…</i>

228
00:20:42.625 --> 00:20:45.666
<i>you're gonna breathe out all the black…</i>

229
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:46.750
Did you know…

230
00:20:46.833 --> 00:20:48.375
<i>…dark. bad air.</i>

231
00:20:48.458 --> 00:20:49.458
What?

232
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.750
That there's a frog that makes this sound?

233
00:20:54.291 --> 00:20:56.666
<i>And that's all the things</i>
<i>you don't like.</i>

234
00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:58.000
Up top. Oh. don't hurt me.

235
00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:01.541
-I'm not trying to hurt you.
<i>-Like when you're angry…</i>

236
00:21:01.625 --> 00:21:03.125
You're getting it in my beard!

237
00:21:03.208 --> 00:21:04.958
<i>…or when you're scared and stuff.</i>

238
00:21:05.041 --> 00:21:06.791
-Close your eyes. Trust me.
-No.

239
00:21:06.916 --> 00:21:10.541
<i>Things you don't like</i>
<i>and then you breathe in the clear air…</i>

240
00:21:12.083 --> 00:21:13.791
<i>…and out the blackness.</i>

241
00:21:14.583 --> 00:21:15.875
There you go.

242
00:21:17.666 --> 00:21:20.458
Your whole body's gonna relax

243
00:21:20.541 --> 00:21:24.000
from your feet. your knees.

244
00:21:24.083 --> 00:21:25.750
your hips.

245
00:21:26.791 --> 00:21:30.666
your stomach. your chest.

246
00:21:31.208 --> 00:21:32.916
In the clear air…

247
00:21:35.375 --> 00:21:36.208
…out the black--

248
00:22:09.708 --> 00:22:11.208
Do you need a hand?

249
00:22:17.041 --> 00:22:18.166
Sorry.

250
00:22:35.833 --> 00:22:38.750
Ah. I'm just fucking with you.
You look good. Come on.

251
00:22:39.708 --> 00:22:41.791
Now he's gonna make me go shopping.

252
00:22:49.666 --> 00:22:50.666
Hey.

253
00:22:52.208 --> 00:22:53.458
Shut the fuckin' door.

254
00:22:55.541 --> 00:22:57.833
-What's going on here?
-Sit down.

255
00:22:58.875 --> 00:23:00.625
Hand over your phones.

256
00:23:00.708 --> 00:23:02.333
What do you need our phones for?

257
00:23:03.375 --> 00:23:04.333
Unlock them.

258
00:23:06.833 --> 00:23:08.333
What do you need them for?

259
00:23:08.416 --> 00:23:10.916
We're deleting all of Paul's contacts.

260
00:23:11.458 --> 00:23:14.083
He's downstairs. Give him this.

261
00:23:14.166 --> 00:23:15.666
John's taken care of everything.

262
00:23:16.333 --> 00:23:18.000
Have a drink with Paul

263
00:23:18.083 --> 00:23:20.208
and then we're taking him to the airport.

264
00:23:20.291 --> 00:23:23.375
And you. do whatever Mark tells you to do.

265
00:23:28.708 --> 00:23:30.166
There you fuckin' are.

266
00:23:32.958 --> 00:23:33.833
Sit down.

267
00:23:37.083 --> 00:23:38.458
-Hey. Henry.
-How you doing?

268
00:23:40.666 --> 00:23:42.583
All right. there's ten grand in there.

269
00:23:43.958 --> 00:23:45.541
Passport's been issued.

270
00:23:46.583 --> 00:23:47.958
Ticket to the UK as well.

271
00:23:49.125 --> 00:23:50.750
And your visa's good for a year.

272
00:23:53.541 --> 00:23:56.791
Listen. mate. whatever this is about.
I don't want to know about it.

273
00:23:56.875 --> 00:24:00.083
We don't need to know.
You told John and that's all that matters.

274
00:24:00.666 --> 00:24:01.500
Okay?

275
00:24:02.125 --> 00:24:05.000
And he reckons it'll all be over
by the time you get back.

276
00:24:07.041 --> 00:24:10.625
We've all got a history. mate.
We've all got a past.

277
00:24:12.291 --> 00:24:14.750
And now you're nobody. Woo-hoo.

278
00:24:17.916 --> 00:24:19.125
Cheer up. man.

279
00:24:19.208 --> 00:24:20.625
I'm gonna get us a drink.

280
00:24:35.916 --> 00:24:36.916
Henry…

281
00:24:41.208 --> 00:24:42.250
Trust Mark.

282
00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:45.916
Trust Mark. Yeah?

283
00:24:47.541 --> 00:24:50.125
If you're honest--
If you're honest with these guys.

284
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.500
you'll be looked after. mate.
You'll be looked after.

285
00:25:04.458 --> 00:25:05.833
What are we doing out here?

286
00:25:06.625 --> 00:25:08.541
We're making sure that Paul's clean.

287
00:25:19.208 --> 00:25:20.375
Who's John?

288
00:25:21.416 --> 00:25:22.916
He's your employer.

289
00:25:36.375 --> 00:25:38.375
Sorry. I can be a bit of a cunt.

290
00:25:39.958 --> 00:25:42.333
I've had issues myself in the past.

291
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.583
This is the only family I've ever had.

292
00:25:49.791 --> 00:25:52.125
So. listen. if you have any issues.

293
00:25:53.375 --> 00:25:56.250
if you need help or what have you.

294
00:25:56.958 --> 00:25:58.583
just come out here and you wait.

295
00:26:00.416 --> 00:26:01.791
and I'll find you. brother.

296
00:26:20.708 --> 00:26:24.041
After the child
was abducted from the underpass.

297
00:26:24.125 --> 00:26:26.875
he was questioned several times
due to his record.

298
00:26:28.041 --> 00:26:29.791
He refused psychological testing.

299
00:26:30.666 --> 00:26:33.333
He stated he had a history
of violent offences.

300
00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:35.708
There's an assault in the NT.

301
00:26:37.708 --> 00:26:38.833
Details aren't listed.

302
00:26:41.375 --> 00:26:45.916
We've been tasked P28
to reassess for the coronial inquest.

303
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.416
At the time of the abduction.
P28's file was closed

304
00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.791
after detectives found
insufficient time or evidence

305
00:26:52.875 --> 00:26:55.333
for him to be considered
a person of interest.

306
00:26:55.416 --> 00:26:57.666
He has since relocated
to Western Australia.

307
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:04.333
We've been tasked with P27.

308
00:27:04.416 --> 00:27:07.166
He has a history of assault
and sexual violence.

309
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:10.208
His movements place him
in the region. the bypass road

310
00:27:10.291 --> 00:27:12.833
on the morning of the 12th of May. 2002.

311
00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:17.250
-We're tasked with P26.

312
00:27:17.333 --> 00:27:20.000
He has a lengthy history
of domestic assault charges.

313
00:27:20.083 --> 00:27:22.541
There are currently four AVOs
ascribed to him.

314
00:27:41.375 --> 00:27:42.500
Mark.

315
00:27:55.541 --> 00:27:58.166
Thank you for everything
you've done on this case.

316
00:27:58.916 --> 00:28:02.458
It's your groundwork got us to this point.
so you should be proud of that.

317
00:28:09.166 --> 00:28:10.541
See you on the other side.

318
00:28:11.208 --> 00:28:12.541
Flying back to Queensland?

319
00:28:13.625 --> 00:28:14.500
Hey!

320
00:28:18.833 --> 00:28:19.833
We burnt your car.

321
00:28:27.291 --> 00:28:30.833
<i>The decision is we can't have him</i>
<i>in densely populated areas.</i>

322
00:28:30.916 --> 00:28:32.083
<i>so isolate him further.</i>

323
00:28:33.583 --> 00:28:37.083
<i>Downside is we can't have</i>
<i>physical surveillance in remote areas.</i>

324
00:28:37.166 --> 00:28:39.541
<i>which means you'll be</i>
<i>unprotected and unobserved</i>

325
00:28:39.625 --> 00:28:41.500
<i>apart from the recording equipment.</i>

326
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.875
<i>The whole operation hinges</i>
<i>on you getting closer with him.</i>

327
00:28:47.708 --> 00:28:49.291
<i>I know you fuckin' know this.</i>

328
00:28:49.916 --> 00:28:52.833
Don't find yourself in terrain
that you're unfamiliar with.

329
00:28:53.458 --> 00:28:57.375
Weigh the balance of the closeness you
could form against your own vulnerability.

330
00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.375
-Fuck!

331
00:29:31.458 --> 00:29:32.666
I said wait in the car.

332
00:29:33.791 --> 00:29:35.250
You were taking ages.

333
00:29:37.541 --> 00:29:39.625
Could've been one of those silent alarms.

334
00:29:39.708 --> 00:29:42.166
Ah. I sorted that ages ago.

335
00:29:42.833 --> 00:29:44.375
Here. I forgot your brand.

336
00:29:45.208 --> 00:29:46.875
-Here you go.
-Thanks. mate.

337
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.583
-Do you want a smoke?
-Nah. I quit.

338
00:30:07.041 --> 00:30:08.916
<i>Do you want a smoke?</i>

339
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.583
<i>Nah. I quit.</i>

340
00:30:13.666 --> 00:30:16.041
<i>I couldn't find a job</i>
<i>anywhere before this.</i>

341
00:30:16.958 --> 00:30:19.541
<i>You got a criminal record.</i>
<i>you're fucked these days.</i>

342
00:30:20.416 --> 00:30:21.750
<i>My dad was in the Army.</i>

343
00:30:23.708 --> 00:30:26.000
<i>Thought about joining the Reserves myself.</i>

344
00:30:26.833 --> 00:30:28.333
<i>I did all the tests.</i>

345
00:30:29.541 --> 00:30:32.166
<i>I failed the psych</i>
<i>'cause I fuckin' sleepwalk.</i>

346
00:30:52.291 --> 00:30:53.708
<i>Do I look like a monster?</i>

347
00:30:53.791 --> 00:30:54.625
What?

348
00:30:54.708 --> 00:30:58.166
I can taste with my feet
and hear with my fur.

349
00:30:58.250 --> 00:30:59.625
-What am I?
-What?

350
00:30:59.708 --> 00:31:00.958
A moth.

351
00:31:01.041 --> 00:31:03.416
You're a pain in the arse.
that's what you are.

352
00:31:04.166 --> 00:31:06.375
-No. here. here. Here.

353
00:31:09.416 --> 00:31:11.291
All right. mate. See you Thursday.

354
00:31:15.291 --> 00:31:17.666
This is Detective Senior Constable
Kate Rylett

355
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:20.375
in the presence of Detective
Senior Constable Graham Ikin.

356
00:31:20.458 --> 00:31:22.416
We are carrying out a timing
of the movements

357
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:27.166
of POI 28. Henry Teague.
on the 12th May. 2002.

358
00:31:28.708 --> 00:31:32.125
<i>P28 claims to have left</i>
<i>his home at 2:50 p.m.</i>

359
00:31:32.208 --> 00:31:34.375
<i>and returned at 5:30 p.m.</i>

360
00:31:35.166 --> 00:31:38.500
<i>He drove along the bypass</i>
<i>towards a relative's house.</i>

361
00:31:38.583 --> 00:31:41.208
<i>he parked and collected an engine part.</i>

362
00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:47.166
<i>He returned along the same road.</i>
<i>passing the bus stop at the underpass.</i>

363
00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:51.208
<i>where the victim was last seen</i>
<i>between 4:05 and 4:10 p.m.</i>

364
00:31:52.833 --> 00:31:55.000
He claims not to have seen the child.

365
00:31:55.083 --> 00:31:56.666
but places himself driving past

366
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:59.791
at the same time the child was
observed by other witnesses.

367
00:32:00.333 --> 00:32:02.083
including those on a passing bus.

368
00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:05.958
<i>That bus wasn't taking passengers.</i>

369
00:32:07.083 --> 00:32:09.958
<i>It drives through</i>
<i>the underpass at 4:15 p.m.</i>

370
00:32:11.541 --> 00:32:14.375
<i>A number of witnesses</i>
<i>on that bus saw the boy.</i>

371
00:32:15.041 --> 00:32:16.958
<i>He was waiting by the side of the road</i>

372
00:32:17.625 --> 00:32:19.416
<i>with a man standing behind him.</i>

373
00:32:20.625 --> 00:32:22.750
<i>leaning against a pillar of the underpass.</i>

374
00:32:23.291 --> 00:32:26.083
<i>his leg bent behind him like a stork.</i>

375
00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.791
<i>A second bus passes at 4:18 p.m.</i>

376
00:32:34.458 --> 00:32:37.916
There are no sightings of either the boy
or the man from that last bus

377
00:32:38.916 --> 00:32:40.708
which means in those three minutes.

378
00:32:41.333 --> 00:32:45.375
between 4:15 to 4:18 p.m.. he's taken.

379
00:33:05.541 --> 00:33:08.666
<i>He claimed that a camera.</i>
<i>angled at the road.</i>

380
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:11.083
<i>would've seen his car</i>
<i>driving through the site.</i>

381
00:33:12.333 --> 00:33:14.291
<i>That camera was not operational.</i>

382
00:33:15.625 --> 00:33:17.750
He-- He's only placed himself at the scene

383
00:33:19.041 --> 00:33:21.583
because he thinks
he was recorded passing through it.

384
00:33:23.666 --> 00:33:26.708
<i>P28 claimed he drove</i>
<i>through the site without stopping.</i>

385
00:33:26.791 --> 00:33:29.666
<i>proceeding directly to</i>
<i>the home of an elderly friend</i>

386
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:31.666
<i>with whom he spent the next half hour.</i>

387
00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:35.166
<i>The alibi no longer resides</i>
<i>at her home address.</i>

388
00:33:37.166 --> 00:33:39.625
<i>When asked why</i>
<i>he hadn't raised the alibi earlier.</i>

389
00:33:39.708 --> 00:33:43.291
<i>P28 stated it was because</i>
<i>he did not want to upset her.</i>

390
00:33:47.916 --> 00:33:48.875
Hello. Mari.

391
00:33:50.791 --> 00:33:51.708
How are you today?

392
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.208
What was the period of time
you were hoping to talk to her about?

393
00:33:59.291 --> 00:34:00.416
We can't discuss that.

394
00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:06.916
He claimed to have been with her
between 4:10 and 4:45 p.m..

395
00:34:07.875 --> 00:34:09.916
however. she's unable to confirm that.

396
00:34:12.875 --> 00:34:15.333
Forensic investigators
attended his property

397
00:34:15.416 --> 00:34:16.500
in the days following

398
00:34:16.583 --> 00:34:18.750
and conducted an examination
of his vehicle.

399
00:34:19.875 --> 00:34:22.750
Tape lifts were taken through
the interior of the car.

400
00:34:24.625 --> 00:34:26.333
There's no record of the results here.

401
00:34:27.125 --> 00:34:30.666
<i>Senior police considered him</i>
<i>an unlikely suspect regardless.</i>

402
00:34:31.333 --> 00:34:34.083
<i>as he did not drive</i>
<i>the "boxy black vehicle"</i>

403
00:34:34.166 --> 00:34:36.500
<i>sighted by multiple witnesses</i>
<i>at the scene.</i>

404
00:34:36.583 --> 00:34:38.333
<i>The conclusions were a lack of evidence</i>

405
00:34:38.416 --> 00:34:41.458
<i>and insufficient time for him</i>
<i>to have abducted the child</i>

406
00:34:41.541 --> 00:34:43.500
<i>and returned home by 5:30</i>

407
00:34:43.583 --> 00:34:45.583
to what he stated he'd been doing.

408
00:34:45.666 --> 00:34:46.666
Which was what?

409
00:34:48.166 --> 00:34:49.000
Cleaning.

410
00:34:53.666 --> 00:34:57.625
You know. when I was a kid. I used to ride
the cane trains all the fuckin' time.

411
00:35:00.958 --> 00:35:02.583
Out of my fuckin' head. I was.

412
00:35:08.625 --> 00:35:10.583
I never felt more free until now. mate.

413
00:35:17.541 --> 00:35:21.083
I reckon this is what
fuckin' real dreams are made of.

414
00:35:29.333 --> 00:35:30.208
You know Paul?

415
00:35:31.125 --> 00:35:35.375
When I first met him. I…
I didn't even fuckin' trust him.

416
00:35:35.458 --> 00:35:39.166
I thought he was a fuckin'
reporter or something. you know?

417
00:35:41.083 --> 00:35:43.291
With all the fuckin' questions
he was asking.

418
00:35:44.833 --> 00:35:46.500
That cunt couldn't be a reporter.

419
00:35:47.791 --> 00:35:49.166
He can hardly fuckin' read.

420
00:35:56.958 --> 00:35:57.958
It's true.

421
00:35:59.416 --> 00:36:01.000
He's a fuckin' dumb dummy.

422
00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:20.250
-Done?
-No. not yet.

423
00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:31.625
Hey.

424
00:36:33.708 --> 00:36:34.875
This is Henry.

425
00:36:40.041 --> 00:36:41.250
Here you go.

426
00:36:41.333 --> 00:36:42.208
Good?

427
00:36:43.041 --> 00:36:44.625
-Yeah. you'll let me know?
-Yep.

428
00:36:51.166 --> 00:36:52.041
So…

429
00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:54.833
Meeting him is a marker of trust.

430
00:36:54.916 --> 00:36:57.250
It means you've been brought further in.

431
00:36:57.875 --> 00:36:59.875
He's a detective senior sergeant.

432
00:37:00.666 --> 00:37:02.916
His influence goes right up
through the ranks.

433
00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:05.666
If you ever see him out.
don't approach him.

434
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:06.666
don't talk to him.

435
00:37:07.583 --> 00:37:09.541
He's hooked us up with an arms contact.

436
00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:12.458
<i>We've got to go and meet him out of town.</i>

437
00:37:18.583 --> 00:37:22.083
Two 1911s.
two Berettas. three Glocks.

438
00:37:22.166 --> 00:37:24.000
I can do the lot for. like. 12…

439
00:37:41.416 --> 00:37:42.458
I like firearms.

440
00:37:43.041 --> 00:37:44.208
I used to collect them.

441
00:37:45.166 --> 00:37:47.375
Now it's antiques.
little trinkets like this.

442
00:37:49.416 --> 00:37:50.458
Oh.

443
00:37:54.416 --> 00:37:55.708
Who's Rylett?

444
00:37:57.125 --> 00:37:58.458
-Rylett?
-Mm.

445
00:37:59.375 --> 00:38:02.958
Oh. Rylett Holdings. Yeah.
I used to work for them back east.

446
00:38:07.291 --> 00:38:08.500
<i>This is Kate Rylett.</i>

447
00:38:08.583 --> 00:38:13.250
<i>I'm after any archival video material</i>
<i>related to P28. Henry Teague.</i>

448
00:38:19.708 --> 00:38:21.916
<i>What was your relationship?</i>

449
00:38:22.791 --> 00:38:24.291
<i>We met through church.</i>

450
00:38:27.708 --> 00:38:29.625
<i>Why have you come forward?</i>

451
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:34.541
<i>Well. I don't…</i>
<i>I don't know about this case. but. um…</i>

452
00:38:36.791 --> 00:38:40.041
<i>but if a child's gone missing</i>
<i>and he was in the area. then I…</i>

453
00:38:42.166 --> 00:38:43.208
<i>think that…</i>

454
00:38:45.333 --> 00:38:47.250
<i>You think he was involved?</i>

455
00:38:48.458 --> 00:38:49.458
<i>Yeah.</i>

456
00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:55.041
<i>He drove us into the forest</i>
<i>this one night. um…</i>

457
00:38:56.541 --> 00:39:00.375
<i>And told me to get out</i>
<i>and pretend that I didn't know him.</i>

458
00:39:00.875 --> 00:39:02.708
<i>And… and then he's…</i>

459
00:39:03.791 --> 00:39:07.791
<i>He's just driven off.</i>
<i>and he's just left me there. Uh…</i>

460
00:39:08.583 --> 00:39:11.916
<i>Then he's… He circled back round.</i>

461
00:39:12.625 --> 00:39:14.708
<i>he's pulled over to talk me into the car.</i>

462
00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:17.833
<i>and then when I climbed in. he's…</i>

463
00:39:18.541 --> 00:39:19.791
<i>Ugh.</i>

464
00:39:21.708 --> 00:39:25.625
<i>He said. "You should…</i>
<i>You should be more careful who you trust."</i>

465
00:39:25.708 --> 00:39:29.125
-<i>And then what happened?</i>

466
00:39:35.291 --> 00:39:37.375
I used to be
a tow-truck driver. you know?

467
00:39:38.458 --> 00:39:42.166
Take the wrecks to… to be destroyed
down at the shredding yard.

468
00:39:43.625 --> 00:39:44.750
If you ever needed to.

469
00:39:44.833 --> 00:39:47.958
that would be a very good place
to get rid of a body. you know.

470
00:39:50.333 --> 00:39:51.541
If you ever needed to.

471
00:39:52.791 --> 00:39:54.125
They don't check the cars?

472
00:39:54.666 --> 00:39:55.625
Nah.

473
00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.500
A lot of fuckin' crosses out here. mate.

474
00:40:04.458 --> 00:40:07.875
I used to be a member of
the church. back east. Yeah.

475
00:40:09.291 --> 00:40:10.833
A charismatic revival.

476
00:40:11.625 --> 00:40:12.708
Do you know the type?

477
00:40:14.666 --> 00:40:15.500
Yeah.

478
00:40:15.583 --> 00:40:18.375
You shake and you flap about.

479
00:40:19.416 --> 00:40:21.375
Then they go into fucking convulsions.

480
00:40:37.833 --> 00:40:38.750
Eh.

481
00:40:39.916 --> 00:40:42.083
I had a falling out
with the pastor. though.

482
00:40:43.916 --> 00:40:46.666
He said there was
no such thing as an unforgivable sin.

483
00:40:48.458 --> 00:40:50.916
All sins could be forgiven.

484
00:40:53.041 --> 00:40:55.958
"That's not what it says in the Bible."
I fuckin' told him.

485
00:40:57.791 --> 00:41:00.791
Standing up there.
preaching things that aren't fuckin' true.

486
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:02.833
Fuckin' lying.

487
00:41:05.958 --> 00:41:09.416
<i>When we get there.</i>
<i>I'll need to go off and meet our contact.</i>

488
00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:12.833
<i>You just hold there at the caravan park</i>

489
00:41:12.916 --> 00:41:15.291
<i>till I come back for you.</i>

490
00:41:19.791 --> 00:41:23.041
Your recording device failed.
Take this one and hand me yours.

491
00:41:25.208 --> 00:41:28.250
You guys. you. you need to
back off further. all right?

492
00:41:28.333 --> 00:41:30.541
You're following way too close.

493
00:41:30.875 --> 00:41:32.083
All right. You all right?

494
00:41:32.166 --> 00:41:34.041
You just…

495
00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:37.666
Just… just run me through
the fuckin' scenario.

496
00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:39.291
There's no scenario. mate.

497
00:41:41.208 --> 00:41:45.166
Local police were alerted to activity
at the warehouse we planned to use.

498
00:41:45.250 --> 00:41:46.250
We had to clear out.

499
00:41:48.708 --> 00:41:49.583
Fuck.

500
00:41:53.458 --> 00:41:54.750
Henry!

501
00:41:54.833 --> 00:41:55.916
-Buddy.
-Henry!

502
00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:57.666
Got to move out. mate.

503
00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:59.875
Hurry up. Get your shit. Serious.

504
00:41:59.958 --> 00:42:01.916
-Quick! Anything else here?
-Yeah.

505
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.375
-No.
-All right.

506
00:42:29.125 --> 00:42:30.125
Do you. um…

507
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:33.583
Do you want to come up to the house?

508
00:42:34.375 --> 00:42:36.416
The missus is out of town at the moment.

509
00:43:02.791 --> 00:43:03.791
Nice.

510
00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:29.583
Back in a sec.

511
00:43:44.791 --> 00:43:46.500
What does your missus do?

512
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000
Oh. she…

513
00:43:49.875 --> 00:43:51.875
She suffers with anxiety and depression.

514
00:43:57.625 --> 00:44:00.125
She doesn't really leave
the house that much.

515
00:44:00.208 --> 00:44:01.250
Oh. yeah?

516
00:44:20.041 --> 00:44:23.125
Bought that with the money
you paid me for the work last week.

517
00:44:31.958 --> 00:44:33.708
-Where did you grow up?

518
00:44:35.458 --> 00:44:36.791
A lot of army bases.

519
00:44:45.250 --> 00:44:47.250
I'm the black sheep of the family. mate.

520
00:44:49.458 --> 00:44:51.833
They're ashamed of me.
Can't fuckin' stand me.

521
00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:53.625
Why's that?

522
00:44:59.041 --> 00:45:00.041
I don't know.

523
00:45:08.458 --> 00:45:09.875
How old are you. Mark?

524
00:45:09.958 --> 00:45:11.083
Forty-six.

525
00:45:13.291 --> 00:45:15.000
-Nearly 50. eh?
-Yeah.

526
00:45:15.708 --> 00:45:16.625
Old man.

527
00:45:19.333 --> 00:45:20.166
Huh.

528
00:45:24.625 --> 00:45:26.750
What kind of music do you listen to. Mark?

529
00:45:28.791 --> 00:45:31.333
I don't really… listen to music.

530
00:45:33.666 --> 00:45:34.541
How do you mean?

531
00:45:36.666 --> 00:45:38.750
Well. I'm not really a song person.

532
00:45:42.541 --> 00:45:43.708
Yeah.

533
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:47.500
Hey. listen. um.

534
00:45:49.166 --> 00:45:53.541
there's preparations
for something that's happening.

535
00:45:55.083 --> 00:45:58.333
and I've talked about bringing you in.

536
00:45:59.083 --> 00:46:01.625
But it would mean travelling out of town.

537
00:46:01.708 --> 00:46:04.458
like. interstate. if you're up for it.

538
00:46:05.458 --> 00:46:07.750
I'm there. mate. I'm there.

539
00:46:08.791 --> 00:46:10.375
Brilliant. All right.

540
00:46:10.958 --> 00:46:11.958
I'll let 'em know.

541
00:46:15.041 --> 00:46:17.541
It's good to have a friend. Mark.
you know.

542
00:46:19.333 --> 00:46:21.083
Someone you can chat to.

543
00:46:22.375 --> 00:46:24.375
-Yeah.
-It's been a while.

544
00:46:28.208 --> 00:46:30.458
We see through to the other side.
you and me.

545
00:46:30.708 --> 00:46:32.166
That's why we get on so well.

546
00:46:34.791 --> 00:46:36.666
Yeah. You're doin' good.

547
00:46:39.916 --> 00:46:41.875
Oh. fuck. I'm tired. man.

548
00:46:43.666 --> 00:46:46.416
I have a long drive back.
I'm going to have to head off.

549
00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:48.208
Sorry.

550
00:46:50.291 --> 00:46:52.458
Um… It's a nice place.

551
00:46:52.541 --> 00:46:53.916
-Mark. wait.

552
00:48:22.583 --> 00:48:25.416
-<i>Hey. What are you fuckin' doing?</i>

553
00:48:27.333 --> 00:48:28.541
All right. enough.

554
00:48:30.833 --> 00:48:33.958
All right. one time. That's it. all right?

555
00:48:34.041 --> 00:48:35.958
Hey. wait. wait. wait. Shake my hand.

556
00:48:36.458 --> 00:48:38.125
-Promise.
-All right. okay.

557
00:48:38.208 --> 00:48:40.041
I'm gonna-- How much do I gotta count?

558
00:48:40.583 --> 00:48:41.416
Uh…

559
00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:44.000
-Forty.
-Forty.

560
00:48:44.083 --> 00:48:46.125
Thirty? Thirty. I'll count to 30.

561
00:48:46.208 --> 00:48:50.250
One. two. three.

562
00:48:51.333 --> 00:48:55.375
four. five. six.

563
00:48:56.625 --> 00:49:00.583
seven. eight. nine.

564
00:49:02.083 --> 00:49:03.958
ten. eleven…

565
00:49:11.166 --> 00:49:13.041
You in here? Huh?

566
00:49:15.791 --> 00:49:16.708
Buddy?

567
00:49:17.583 --> 00:49:18.666
I'm gonna tickle ya.

568
00:49:20.833 --> 00:49:22.666
I'm gonna getcha!

569
00:49:25.458 --> 00:49:26.708
Fuck are you?

570
00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:29.458
Fuck.

571
00:49:30.291 --> 00:49:31.208
Mate?

572
00:49:32.958 --> 00:49:34.416
Mate. I'm fucking serious!

573
00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:36.458
Call out now if you can hear me.

574
00:49:37.791 --> 00:49:38.750
Mate!

575
00:49:39.833 --> 00:49:41.833
Hey. where are you? Mate!

576
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.125
-Mate!
-I'm here!

577
00:49:47.166 --> 00:49:50.125
-What are you doing out here?
-You said hide.

578
00:49:50.208 --> 00:49:52.041
You cannot come out here.

579
00:49:52.125 --> 00:49:54.875
You don't go out here. What did I say?

580
00:49:54.958 --> 00:49:56.583
-Come here.
-You told me to hide.

581
00:49:57.083 --> 00:50:00.208
What did I say?
You don't go outside. Get in the house.

582
00:50:09.791 --> 00:50:11.166
Fucking feel this. cunt.

583
00:50:12.208 --> 00:50:13.416
Feel the wind in me hair.

584
00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:15.166
I can feel the wind in me hair.

585
00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:21.083
What is this fuckin' person doing?

586
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.708
What's the matter with you. you fuck?

587
00:50:24.791 --> 00:50:26.458
Get out there. you fuckin' idiot.

588
00:50:26.541 --> 00:50:30.041
What the fucking matter with you?
Oi! Get the fuck out!

589
00:50:30.125 --> 00:50:31.875
-Fuckin' drive. cunt!

590
00:50:33.250 --> 00:50:34.208
Fuck!

591
00:50:34.291 --> 00:50:35.583
-Fuck.

592
00:50:35.666 --> 00:50:36.666
Fuckin' hell.

593
00:50:45.333 --> 00:50:46.833
-Fuck.

594
00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:54.458
-<i>Police. fire or ambulance?</i>
-Ambulance.

595
00:50:54.541 --> 00:50:57.625
<i>What's the situation there. sir?</i>
<i>Can you describe it for me?</i>

596
00:50:57.708 --> 00:50:59.333
-Uh. car crash.

597
00:50:59.416 --> 00:51:04.208
Uh. corner of Ellery and…
Fuck. I don't know.

598
00:51:06.125 --> 00:51:06.958
<i>All right. sir.</i>

599
00:51:07.041 --> 00:51:09.458
<i>Can I have your name</i>
<i>and a contact number please?</i>

600
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:12.083
-Fuck.

601
00:51:12.166 --> 00:51:14.416
-Henry!
-Sit down here. Sit down.

602
00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:15.416
Yeah.

603
00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:17.125
Henry. come on. We've got to go.

604
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:20.833
Henry!

605
00:51:29.416 --> 00:51:31.250
Do you want to come up to the house?

606
00:51:31.333 --> 00:51:32.625
No. no. no.

607
00:51:34.083 --> 00:51:38.000
They're… they're putting
the final pieces in place

608
00:51:38.083 --> 00:51:39.750
to fly us across to Victoria.

609
00:51:40.458 --> 00:51:42.791
-What?
-What's that noise?

610
00:51:55.458 --> 00:51:56.625
They're putting the final--

611
00:51:56.708 --> 00:51:58.791
I've never been to Victoria.

612
00:52:03.791 --> 00:52:06.625
Okay. I'm just gonna
need you to lay low.

613
00:52:06.708 --> 00:52:09.083
That's all…
I'm fuckin' tired. man.

614
00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:12.625
All right? I'll call you later
with the details. okay?

615
00:52:27.291 --> 00:52:28.416
No. no.

616
00:52:38.291 --> 00:52:39.833
I'm just fuckin' with you.

617
00:52:40.791 --> 00:52:41.916
I know.

618
00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:44.375
I know.

619
00:53:18.458 --> 00:53:22.875
<i>Are you. um.</i>
<i>dealing with any increased irritability?</i>

620
00:53:23.791 --> 00:53:25.041
-Stress?
-<i>Nah.</i>

621
00:53:25.125 --> 00:53:27.541
<i>Nothing that</i>
<i>you've perceived in yourself?</i>

622
00:53:27.625 --> 00:53:28.583
<i>No.</i>

623
00:53:29.541 --> 00:53:30.625
<i>Okay.</i>

624
00:53:30.708 --> 00:53:33.333
<i>Any physical discomfort.</i>
<i>anything likewise?</i>

625
00:53:33.416 --> 00:53:34.333
<i>No.</i>

626
00:53:36.333 --> 00:53:38.458
<i>Any symptoms of depression?</i>

627
00:53:38.541 --> 00:53:39.458
<i>No.</i>

628
00:53:39.541 --> 00:53:40.958
<i>How about anxiety?</i>

629
00:53:41.041 --> 00:53:43.125
-Are you feeling anxious?
-No. No.

630
00:53:44.541 --> 00:53:47.625
And. um. how about any…
any thoughts of self-harm?

631
00:53:48.791 --> 00:53:49.958
No.

632
00:53:50.875 --> 00:53:55.041
Look. um. I do have. um. it noted

633
00:53:55.125 --> 00:53:57.291
that you are dealing
with some sleep issues.

634
00:53:57.375 --> 00:53:59.333
Might it be linked to
your work with WA Police.

635
00:53:59.416 --> 00:54:00.416
or is that more personal?

636
00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:01.500
Nah.

637
00:54:03.458 --> 00:54:05.333
More to do with WA Police
or more personal?

638
00:54:05.416 --> 00:54:06.541
Neither.

639
00:54:08.208 --> 00:54:10.416
Mark. look. the reason that you're here

640
00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:14.291
is I've been told you're being placed
in a difficult work situation.

641
00:54:14.875 --> 00:54:16.958
I've been asked to discuss that with you.

642
00:54:19.625 --> 00:54:22.208
You know. a person in this profession

643
00:54:23.041 --> 00:54:25.125
goes through enough…
goes through enough trauma

644
00:54:25.208 --> 00:54:27.041
that the aggregation of that trauma.

645
00:54:27.125 --> 00:54:29.291
-the amount of it. is overwhelming.
-Mm-hmm.

646
00:54:29.375 --> 00:54:31.500
There's not always an isolated incident

647
00:54:32.375 --> 00:54:33.958
or a situation that--

648
00:54:34.041 --> 00:54:36.250
I don't know what you're talking about.

649
00:54:36.333 --> 00:54:38.666
If you need to take some time off work.

650
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:40.875
there will be other people
that can take your shifts.

651
00:54:47.625 --> 00:54:50.041
Look. I need to talk to you
about the other night

652
00:54:50.125 --> 00:54:51.625
outside the front of my house.

653
00:54:53.541 --> 00:54:55.666
-Uh. no. Henry. listen--
-No. Mark. please.

654
00:54:58.375 --> 00:55:00.375
I used to watch a lot of porn. you know?

655
00:55:01.666 --> 00:55:03.291
Uh. amputees.

656
00:55:05.166 --> 00:55:06.291
That was my thing.

657
00:55:06.375 --> 00:55:11.000
You know. people with no…
no arms. no fuckin' legs.

658
00:55:13.583 --> 00:55:15.625
I don't know what it is about you. Mark.

659
00:55:17.416 --> 00:55:19.583
You… you remind me of an amputee.

660
00:55:21.250 --> 00:55:22.708
You keep talking like that.

661
00:55:22.791 --> 00:55:25.875
I'll have to take you down
to the fuckin' watchhouse.

662
00:55:29.458 --> 00:55:30.583
What was that?

663
00:55:33.041 --> 00:55:34.625
Uh-- Uh…

664
00:55:34.708 --> 00:55:36.500
I've got a black lake in my eye!

665
00:57:26.208 --> 00:57:29.416
<i>You need to know that</i>
<i>I've told them that we cannot replace you.</i>

666
00:57:29.958 --> 00:57:32.375
<i>You've been on for five and a half months.</i>

667
00:57:32.458 --> 00:57:35.041
We can't replicate that
and we can't undo that work.

668
00:57:38.375 --> 00:57:42.291
Flying you down to Melbourne
in the coming days.

669
00:57:42.375 --> 00:57:43.958
Victoria are providing coverts.

670
00:57:45.541 --> 00:57:47.041
That'll take the pressure off.

671
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:50.333
We've heard nothing
about the assault in the NT

672
00:57:50.625 --> 00:57:54.500
and Forensics have come back
with the test results from his vehicle.

673
00:57:54.583 --> 00:57:57.083
The tape lifts they took
were never tested.

674
00:57:58.125 --> 00:58:00.833
They were submitted to the lab
where they were set aside.

675
00:58:01.333 --> 00:58:02.708
They tested them yesterday.

676
00:58:03.708 --> 00:58:05.583
Testing confirms no physical evidence

677
00:58:05.666 --> 00:58:08.000
of any other presence
in the fucking vehicle.

678
00:58:10.625 --> 00:58:11.791
-Sorry.
-It's all right.

679
00:58:13.208 --> 00:58:16.166
They noted that this.
in and of itself. is not conclusive

680
00:58:17.291 --> 00:58:19.541
and that at the time
the tape lifts were taken

681
00:58:19.625 --> 00:58:21.500
the person of interest was compliant.

682
00:58:21.583 --> 00:58:23.791
cooperative and understanding
of the process.

683
00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:29.458
We have absolutely nothing on him.

684
00:58:50.791 --> 00:58:53.833
How's. uh… How's your mum?

685
00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:59.166
She said to not talk about it.

686
00:59:00.416 --> 00:59:01.541
Talk about what?

687
00:59:02.041 --> 00:59:03.083
How she is.

688
00:59:09.875 --> 00:59:11.666
-Hey. mate.
-Yeah?

689
00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:14.750
I'm not gonna be able to
take you for a few days. okay?

690
00:59:14.833 --> 00:59:15.666
Okay.

691
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:17.750
-So you tell your mum?
-Okay.

692
00:59:26.625 --> 00:59:28.208
There's a boy out there.

693
00:59:30.875 --> 00:59:32.041
Alone.

694
00:59:33.791 --> 00:59:35.375
Waiting to be found.

695
00:59:40.041 --> 00:59:41.583
And you know what he's saying?

696
00:59:44.916 --> 00:59:46.041
"Where am I?"

697
00:59:46.583 --> 00:59:47.583
"Where am I?"

698
00:59:50.083 --> 00:59:51.583
"Where the fuck am I?"

699
01:00:43.125 --> 01:00:44.083
Henry.

700
01:00:44.708 --> 01:00:46.875
I heard this is
your first time in Victoria.

701
01:00:48.791 --> 01:00:51.500
Must've done something right
to be sent interstate.

702
01:00:52.291 --> 01:00:54.541
We're making a collection from a contact.

703
01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:58.291
You're taking it back with you to WA.
that's why you're here.

704
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Mark.

705
01:01:02.833 --> 01:01:03.833
Mark!

706
01:01:05.291 --> 01:01:06.583
John's here in town.

707
01:01:23.166 --> 01:01:24.041
Take this.

708
01:01:26.250 --> 01:01:27.708
-You wait here.
-Hey. Mark.

709
01:01:27.791 --> 01:01:29.708
-Follow me through here.

710
01:01:33.083 --> 01:01:35.000
What the fuck's happened to this shit?

711
01:01:49.458 --> 01:01:51.708
-Through here. mate. You all right?

712
01:01:52.333 --> 01:01:53.291
Yep.

713
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.416
Victoria have provided John.

714
01:01:56.333 --> 01:01:58.583
He'll be leading
the final part of the operation.

715
01:01:58.666 --> 01:02:01.208
But my concern is that
he's too direct for Henry.

716
01:02:01.791 --> 01:02:04.166
I need you to talk to him
about Henry's anxiety.

717
01:02:05.250 --> 01:02:09.000
So we've gone after him
and we're racing down this corridor

718
01:02:09.083 --> 01:02:12.041
and he's locked himself in
so we thought. "Well. all right."

719
01:02:12.666 --> 01:02:15.083
"Wait for you to ask
to be nicely let out."

720
01:02:15.166 --> 01:02:16.625
-John.

721
01:02:17.125 --> 01:02:18.708
-Do you have a minute?
-Yeah.

722
01:02:18.791 --> 01:02:21.375
Uh. Mark here's been
leading the operation in WA.

723
01:02:21.458 --> 01:02:23.000
Be good to talk to him about--

724
01:02:23.083 --> 01:02:24.875
Sorry. what was your name again?

725
01:02:24.958 --> 01:02:25.791
Mark.

726
01:02:27.083 --> 01:02:29.291
Yeah. but that's not
your actual name. is it?

727
01:02:29.375 --> 01:02:32.000
I mean they did tell you
not to use your actual name?

728
01:02:32.083 --> 01:02:33.291
Yeah.

729
01:02:33.375 --> 01:02:35.916
So what's your real name?

730
01:02:40.333 --> 01:02:41.583
What's your name?

731
01:02:41.666 --> 01:02:44.166
-Well. it's not Mark. That's taken.

732
01:02:46.541 --> 01:02:49.166
Sorry. I'm just fucking around with you.
I'm sorry.

733
01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:51.625
I'll be with you in a sec.
I've just got to…

734
01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:53.958
So…

735
01:02:54.041 --> 01:02:55.333
He's a fuckin' arsehole.

736
01:02:55.416 --> 01:02:57.583
We've got him here.

737
01:02:57.666 --> 01:03:00.333
We picked him up.
take him down the hallway…

738
01:03:00.416 --> 01:03:05.125
We've been taking out insurance policies.
putting it through our claims officer.

739
01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:08.291
Which puts it in our system…

740
01:03:08.375 --> 01:03:09.375
Mark.

741
01:03:10.333 --> 01:03:12.041
What do you reckon is in the case?

742
01:03:13.458 --> 01:03:14.916
You just have to trust him.

743
01:03:17.625 --> 01:03:20.916
Where is my water?
Where's my water?

744
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.791
Where is my water?

745
01:03:23.416 --> 01:03:25.000
Bloody hell!

746
01:03:25.083 --> 01:03:28.041
No. no. no. no!

747
01:03:28.833 --> 01:03:30.291
-It's him.
-Who?

748
01:03:30.375 --> 01:03:31.291
John.

749
01:03:40.083 --> 01:03:41.875
-You all right. Mark?
-Yeah.

750
01:03:42.416 --> 01:03:43.875
-Flight sorted?
-Yep.

751
01:03:45.166 --> 01:03:46.125
How are you. Henry?

752
01:03:46.208 --> 01:03:47.166
Yeah.

753
01:03:48.666 --> 01:03:51.833
It's really… nice to meet you.
John. yeah. Thanks--

754
01:03:51.916 --> 01:03:53.083
I'm not John.

755
01:03:54.083 --> 01:03:55.208
He's over there.

756
01:03:55.791 --> 01:03:59.458
He wants you to write down
your name and date of birth.

757
01:04:02.791 --> 01:04:04.041
Um. yeah.

758
01:04:28.541 --> 01:04:30.541
He said to write down your other name.

759
01:04:33.708 --> 01:04:36.583
-My other name?
-Yeah. Your other name.

760
01:05:19.583 --> 01:05:22.791
-I changed the name years ago.
-Why didn't you fuckin' tell me?

761
01:05:22.875 --> 01:05:24.791
What's he want to know the name for?

762
01:05:24.875 --> 01:05:26.500
Why didn't you fuckin' tell me?

763
01:05:26.583 --> 01:05:28.875
They'll give your name
to a police contact.

764
01:05:28.958 --> 01:05:30.333
run a background check on you.

765
01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:34.250
We all have to get cleared.
Make sure we won't draw attention.

766
01:05:34.333 --> 01:05:36.416
Yeah. yeah.
don't fuckin' worry about it.

767
01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:38.166
I remember sitting where you are.

768
01:05:38.250 --> 01:05:40.500
thinking I'd never be let in
with the shit I'd done.

769
01:05:41.083 --> 01:05:42.916
-John wants to see you.
-What?

770
01:05:43.708 --> 01:05:45.416
John. He wants to talk to you now.

771
01:06:01.083 --> 01:06:04.916
I heard about you. Henry.

772
01:06:06.333 --> 01:06:07.541
Whatever your name is.

773
01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:11.208
You've got to be honest with us.
all right?

774
01:06:11.833 --> 01:06:13.333
I-- Yeah.

775
01:06:13.875 --> 01:06:15.833
I changed… I changed the name years--

776
01:06:15.916 --> 01:06:17.166
I don't give a fuck.

777
01:06:18.958 --> 01:06:19.916
No.

778
01:06:23.666 --> 01:06:25.375
-What are you staring at?
-Nothin'.

779
01:06:27.375 --> 01:06:29.708
Then why are you still standing there?

780
01:06:39.458 --> 01:06:40.458
Thanks.

781
01:06:41.333 --> 01:06:44.291
Right. They've got us in different places.
Don't leave the hotel.

782
01:06:44.375 --> 01:06:47.041
There's nothing else I haven't told you.
apart from the name.

783
01:06:47.125 --> 01:06:49.541
-Nothing else I know about. at least.
-All right.

784
01:06:49.625 --> 01:06:51.333
Don't leave the hotel. Henry.

785
01:07:20.208 --> 01:07:22.666
<i>I met this woman down</i>
<i>in the hotel bar last night.</i>

786
01:07:25.458 --> 01:07:26.916
<i>Brought her back to the room.</i>

787
01:07:30.541 --> 01:07:32.791
<i>You know what she told me before she left?</i>

788
01:07:34.625 --> 01:07:35.458
Hm.

789
01:07:36.541 --> 01:07:38.458
<i>"I'll never forget you. Henry."</i>

790
01:07:44.541 --> 01:07:48.041
Fuckin' hope they've got enough ink
in the printer to print out my record.

791
01:07:48.125 --> 01:07:50.291
Eh. you don't need to worry about it.

792
01:07:52.541 --> 01:07:55.000
Ah. there's been nothing
in 20 years. mate.

793
01:08:24.375 --> 01:08:26.916
There were no records
of an assault in the NT

794
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.208
under Henry Teague.

795
01:08:28.916 --> 01:08:31.500
They were filed under his
former name. Peter Morley.

796
01:08:32.708 --> 01:08:34.791
I provided them with the information.

797
01:08:35.750 --> 01:08:36.750
but it was misfiled.

798
01:08:39.291 --> 01:08:40.416
Jesus Christ.

799
01:08:45.416 --> 01:08:48.458
<i>I can't. uh.</i>
<i>take your call at the moment.</i>

800
01:08:48.541 --> 01:08:52.083
<i>If you leave me a message.</i>
<i>I'll endeavor to call you back later.</i>

801
01:08:58.250 --> 01:08:59.208
Henry?

802
01:09:02.958 --> 01:09:03.875
Fuck.

803
01:09:11.458 --> 01:09:13.125
-I've lost him.
-<i>What?</i>

804
01:09:13.208 --> 01:09:15.875
-I've fuckin' lost him.
<i>-Did he follow you back?</i>

805
01:09:15.958 --> 01:09:18.458
Uh. no. I don't know.
but I don't think so.

806
01:09:18.541 --> 01:09:19.458
<i>Fuck!</i>

807
01:09:20.125 --> 01:09:22.625
<i>Uh… Listen. Mark.</i>

808
01:09:23.875 --> 01:09:26.125
<i>We can't put out an alert. You know that.</i>

809
01:09:28.916 --> 01:09:31.041
<i>There… there can't be a follow vehicle.</i>

810
01:09:31.125 --> 01:09:33.708
<i>I can't put out an alert.</i>
<i>You have to try and find him.</i>

811
01:09:33.791 --> 01:09:34.708
What?

812
01:09:34.791 --> 01:09:37.166
<i>You're gonna have to</i>
<i>try to find him. mate.</i>

813
01:09:37.250 --> 01:09:38.750
<i>Only issue is the alibi.</i>

814
01:09:38.833 --> 01:09:41.708
<i>Her daughter worked at a local RSL</i>
<i>at the time of the abduction.</i>

815
01:09:42.416 --> 01:09:44.958
<i>She said her mum was often there.</i>
<i>playing the machines.</i>

816
01:09:45.041 --> 01:09:47.833
<i>Don't have security camera</i>
<i>footage dating back to 2002?</i>

817
01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:49.833
Not back that far.

818
01:09:52.416 --> 01:09:54.583
Do you keep records of your sign-in books?

819
01:09:54.666 --> 01:09:56.875
If she was a regular.
she wouldn't have to sign.

820
01:09:56.958 --> 01:09:58.750
What do you do for the regulars?

821
01:09:58.833 --> 01:10:01.000
We used to have a loyalty program

822
01:10:01.083 --> 01:10:03.125
where members could scan their cards

823
01:10:03.208 --> 01:10:05.083
and the machine
would record their numbers.

824
01:10:05.166 --> 01:10:06.833
How would we track down--

825
01:10:07.625 --> 01:10:08.458
Sorry.

826
01:10:08.541 --> 01:10:11.708
<i>They shall not</i>
<i>grow old. as we who are left grow old.</i>

827
01:10:12.333 --> 01:10:15.583
<i>Age shall not weary them.</i>
<i>nor the years condemn.</i>

828
01:10:17.916 --> 01:10:20.500
<i>At the going down of the sun</i>
<i>and in the morning.</i>

829
01:10:20.583 --> 01:10:21.833
<i>we shall remember them.</i>

830
01:10:21.916 --> 01:10:23.250
We shall remember them.

831
01:10:23.333 --> 01:10:25.750
-We shall remember them.
-We shall remember them.

832
01:10:35.458 --> 01:10:38.833
-<i>Lest we forget.</i>
-We'll have her number on file.

833
01:10:38.916 --> 01:10:41.750
-but the machines have been out of use--
-Where are they?

834
01:10:49.583 --> 01:10:51.250
What's the date you're after?

835
01:10:52.125 --> 01:10:54.500
The 12th May. 2002.

836
01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:36.875
<i>I'm sittin' here with</i>
<i>the missus and just had ourselves a roast.</i>

837
01:12:39.875 --> 01:12:41.333
<i>She says hello. by the way.</i>

838
01:12:42.958 --> 01:12:45.791
<i>"Hello. Mark." she's saying.</i>
<i>"Hello. Mark."</i>

839
01:12:46.375 --> 01:12:48.333
<i>Tell her I-- Tell her I said hi.</i>

840
01:12:50.375 --> 01:12:52.000
<i>Mate. where-- Where are you?</i>

841
01:12:52.083 --> 01:12:54.083
-Are you okay?
-<i>Yeah.</i>

842
01:12:55.458 --> 01:12:57.375
<i>I had to head out of town for a while.</i>

843
01:12:58.208 --> 01:13:01.750
<i>Well. why don't I talk</i>
<i>to the boys. we'll work out--</i>

844
01:13:03.666 --> 01:13:05.833
Yeah. he's anxious. He's unsettled.

845
01:13:07.916 --> 01:13:12.541
At this point. we feel that
we could lose him… at any time.

846
01:13:15.125 --> 01:13:16.583
<i>We need to get John out here</i>

847
01:13:17.375 --> 01:13:19.166
<i>and prepare to make the final push.</i>

848
01:13:25.791 --> 01:13:29.041
<i>The interstate job</i>
<i>was in preparation for a larger shipment.</i>

849
01:13:29.666 --> 01:13:32.416
Mark. here.
has put you forward for this. Henry.

850
01:13:33.416 --> 01:13:35.416
And this is just the start. mate.

851
01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:37.833
This is nothing.
This is just a fuckin' run.

852
01:13:37.916 --> 01:13:41.458
It's a remote airfield.
hour-and-a-half out of town.

853
01:13:42.250 --> 01:13:45.833
<i>John's concerned about security</i>
<i>and we need you to case the site.</i>

854
01:13:47.791 --> 01:13:51.375
<i>When the delivery is made.</i>
<i>you'll take 10% of the profit.</i>

855
01:13:51.458 --> 01:13:54.625
<i>To be clear. Henry.</i>
<i>that's over $100.000 each.</i>

856
01:14:06.333 --> 01:14:08.458
I've been. uh.
doing the security down here

857
01:14:08.541 --> 01:14:11.416
for nearly five years
and. uh. it never gets old.

858
01:14:13.291 --> 01:14:15.666
We're open to the public
on Sundays. by the way.

859
01:14:16.458 --> 01:14:18.958
Oh. right. yeah.
I might bring my boys out.

860
01:14:19.041 --> 01:14:20.791
Yeah. you should. They'd enjoy it.

861
01:14:24.375 --> 01:14:27.583
You like the look of that. eh?
You want to sit in the front seat?

862
01:14:28.750 --> 01:14:32.333
<i>I was 54 when I started.</i>
<i>I learned with my son.</i>

863
01:14:33.166 --> 01:14:36.541
<i>I had a fear of heights.</i>
<i>but. uh. when you get in here.</i>

864
01:14:36.625 --> 01:14:37.916
it feels really safe.

865
01:14:38.666 --> 01:14:40.458
-Yeah.
-It feels very safe.

866
01:14:41.041 --> 01:14:42.125
It does feel safe.

867
01:14:45.875 --> 01:14:47.416
How much are these worth?

868
01:14:48.208 --> 01:14:51.916
Well. there's. uh. no ceiling
in the price of planes

869
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.375
but. uh. that. um… that plane back there.

870
01:14:56.333 --> 01:14:58.583
that's. uh. $60.000.

871
01:15:14.833 --> 01:15:16.708
We've disproved his alibi.

872
01:15:16.791 --> 01:15:18.875
She was on the machines at the local RSL.

873
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:21.666
He couldn't have been
with her at the time.

874
01:15:23.333 --> 01:15:24.541
Where was he then?

875
01:15:27.291 --> 01:15:28.500
Not… not there.

876
01:15:32.375 --> 01:15:34.125
Have you seen the records from the NT?

877
01:15:34.208 --> 01:15:35.166
I'm reading them.

878
01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:47.500
Follow me. please.

879
01:16:25.958 --> 01:16:27.500
Take a seat. There's fine.

880
01:16:31.791 --> 01:16:33.291
I'm Detective Sergeant Cross.

881
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.791
I'm the controller for
the Covert and Specialist Operations crew.

882
01:16:37.333 --> 01:16:40.333
I'm here to inform you
that at the close of the coronial inquest

883
01:16:40.416 --> 01:16:42.666
there'll be a UC sitting
next to your person of interest

884
01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:45.166
-on his return to WA. This is Paul Emery.

885
01:16:46.083 --> 01:16:47.208
-Hey.
-Hi.

886
01:16:47.291 --> 01:16:49.625
The intention will be
for Paul to make contact

887
01:16:49.708 --> 01:16:51.333
with the POI on his return trip.

888
01:16:51.416 --> 01:16:54.041
see where that takes us
over a two-week period.

889
01:16:54.125 --> 01:16:57.000
I'm afraid. unless they decide
to take it further. that's…

890
01:16:58.416 --> 01:16:59.250
That's it.

891
01:17:00.583 --> 01:17:02.833
You're here to brief us
about his background.

892
01:17:02.916 --> 01:17:05.000
-Right. But he did it.
-Mm.

893
01:17:09.208 --> 01:17:12.416
And I know they've probably told
you he isn't worth the effort.

894
01:17:14.083 --> 01:17:15.083
but he did it.

895
01:17:16.333 --> 01:17:19.125
Well.
we've only just been allocated this.

896
01:17:20.583 --> 01:17:22.875
Tell us what we can use
to get him to talk.

897
01:17:24.250 --> 01:17:25.916
<i>Is this Peter Morley?</i>

898
01:17:26.666 --> 01:17:27.541
<i>No.</i>

899
01:17:28.083 --> 01:17:31.166
Is this Peter Morley.
otherwise known as Henry Peter Teague?

900
01:17:32.666 --> 01:17:34.083
<i>Who's this?</i>

901
01:17:34.166 --> 01:17:35.375
My name's Kate Rylett.

902
01:17:36.458 --> 01:17:38.791
I'm a detective senior constable
in Queensland.

903
01:17:39.625 --> 01:17:42.000
<i>As the detectives would've informed you.</i>

904
01:17:42.083 --> 01:17:46.250
<i>you've been summonsed to appear</i>
<i>at a coronial inquest in Queensland…</i>

905
01:17:46.333 --> 01:17:47.250
Henry Teague.

906
01:17:47.333 --> 01:17:52.166
<i>…into the suspected abduction</i>
<i>and murder of James Liston in 2002.</i>

907
01:17:53.666 --> 01:17:55.583
<i>I'm going to give you my phone number.</i>

908
01:17:56.125 --> 01:17:58.791
<i>I'll be your point of contact</i>
<i>from here on.</i>

909
01:17:58.875 --> 01:18:00.541
<i>And what if I refuse to come?</i>

910
01:18:00.625 --> 01:18:02.125
<i>If you don't want to come.</i>

911
01:18:02.208 --> 01:18:04.958
<i>the Queensland coroner</i>
<i>will issue a warrant</i>

912
01:18:05.041 --> 01:18:08.625
<i>for you to be taken into custody</i>
<i>and brought before the inquest.</i>

913
01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:13.375
<i>After the inquest.</i>
<i>we'll provide you with transport.</i>

914
01:18:14.333 --> 01:18:17.708
<i>as I understand that</i>
<i>you currently live in Western Australia.</i>

915
01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:21.375
<i>We'll ensure you're returned</i>
<i>to your place of residence.</i>

916
01:18:22.208 --> 01:18:24.583
<i>assuming you aren't required</i>
<i>to remain in Queensland</i>

917
01:18:24.666 --> 01:18:26.083
<i>at the close of the process.</i>

918
01:18:44.583 --> 01:18:48.166
<i>We've reviewed the brief</i>
<i>of evidence prepared by Detective Rylett.</i>

919
01:18:50.916 --> 01:18:52.083
Paul Emery?

920
01:18:52.166 --> 01:18:54.916
And we can see reason
to invest WA Pol resources

921
01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.458
in your person of interest.

922
01:18:56.916 --> 01:18:59.500
You'll remain here as a controller.
work with us on this.

923
01:19:00.625 --> 01:19:03.541
We're initiating an operation
that would mean introducing Mark here

924
01:19:03.625 --> 01:19:09.083
as part of a criminal organization
that can relocate people. erase histories…

925
01:19:10.666 --> 01:19:11.833
<i>…offer him a way out.</i>

926
01:19:15.791 --> 01:19:16.833
<i>It's dark.</i>

927
01:19:22.416 --> 01:19:24.083
I step out the front of my house.

928
01:19:29.916 --> 01:19:32.583
And I get this feeling
of lightness come over me.

929
01:19:34.166 --> 01:19:35.625
So I start to run.

930
01:19:36.666 --> 01:19:38.125
And then I'm up in the air

931
01:19:38.208 --> 01:19:42.041
and I'm flying over the back fences
and the houses that I grew up in.

932
01:19:46.458 --> 01:19:49.041
Fixed-wing licence costs $10.000.

933
01:19:50.375 --> 01:19:53.791
Two $5.000 payments.
Hey. figure how useful I'd be. Mark.

934
01:19:53.875 --> 01:19:56.416
-I-- I could be landing on airstrips

935
01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:58.958
all over the country. you know.
making deliveries.

936
01:20:04.541 --> 01:20:05.541
Yeah?

937
01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:10.166
All right. We'll head over
to the airfield after that.

938
01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
We're going to go meet him out of town.

939
01:20:37.125 --> 01:20:37.958
Henry.

940
01:20:39.041 --> 01:20:40.125
Mark.

941
01:20:41.166 --> 01:20:42.333
-All right?
-Yeah. good.

942
01:20:42.833 --> 01:20:45.041
There's a car to be ditched.
Police have eyes on it.

943
01:20:45.125 --> 01:20:47.041
Make sure it's not parked where it is.

944
01:20:47.125 --> 01:20:48.458
I'll send you the details.

945
01:20:49.375 --> 01:20:52.208
Henry. there's. um…
I don't know if you're aware of this.

946
01:20:52.291 --> 01:20:54.750
but there's a subpoena
that's been issued for you.

947
01:20:55.833 --> 01:20:57.000
Nah.

948
01:20:57.083 --> 01:20:59.041
Yeah. Queensland Coroners Court.

949
01:20:59.125 --> 01:21:00.250
Are you aware of that?

950
01:21:01.791 --> 01:21:04.208
No. that's done. I went through that.

951
01:21:04.291 --> 01:21:06.125
No. This is different.

952
01:21:09.375 --> 01:21:11.000
Another inquest. is it?

953
01:21:12.166 --> 01:21:14.541
Yeah. apparently they have
some new information.

954
01:21:38.875 --> 01:21:41.125
-Can't let you hold on to that.
-Yep.

955
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Thanks.

956
01:21:46.083 --> 01:21:48.375
-Is that it?
-Yeah. that's it.

957
01:22:00.041 --> 01:22:01.041
What was that about?

958
01:22:01.125 --> 01:22:04.916
Uh… I was in the same area
when this person went missing.

959
01:22:05.583 --> 01:22:08.666
Police harassed me for it at the time.
Nothing came of it. so…

960
01:22:16.250 --> 01:22:17.625
How many times have I told you--

961
01:22:17.708 --> 01:22:21.208
If I'd known there could've been
another subpoena. I would've told you.

962
01:22:24.666 --> 01:22:25.666
What?

963
01:22:26.875 --> 01:22:28.375
Yeah. I am.

964
01:22:29.916 --> 01:22:30.916
What?

965
01:22:34.541 --> 01:22:35.416
Now?

966
01:22:38.416 --> 01:22:39.375
All right.

967
01:22:40.333 --> 01:22:42.541
Yeah. fuckin' all right. I'm doing it now.

968
01:22:42.625 --> 01:22:44.208
-What is it?

969
01:22:46.166 --> 01:22:47.500
I've got to turn around.

970
01:22:47.583 --> 01:22:48.416
Why?

971
01:22:49.125 --> 01:22:52.791
The airfield is. uh. not on tonight.

972
01:22:53.875 --> 01:22:55.125
John's in town.

973
01:22:55.791 --> 01:22:57.916
We're gonna go. um…
We're gonna go see him.

974
01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.791
It's probably about the airfield.

975
01:23:01.083 --> 01:23:02.583
Could be about the inquest.

976
01:23:03.208 --> 01:23:04.041
Huh?

977
01:23:05.041 --> 01:23:06.750
It could be about the inquest.

978
01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:08.916
I really don't fuckin' know.

979
01:24:15.458 --> 01:24:18.625
Okay. Well done.
And I'll give you a call this afternoon.

980
01:24:18.708 --> 01:24:20.500
-All right. Take care.
-Hey.

981
01:24:21.250 --> 01:24:22.291
-Hey.
-Hey. hey.

982
01:24:22.375 --> 01:24:23.750
-How you doin'?
-Good. good.

983
01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:27.458
-Uh. Henry. John. John. Henry.
-Yeah.

984
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.416
-Good?
-You remember Henry?

985
01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:31.500
-All good?
-Yep.

986
01:24:31.583 --> 01:24:32.625
-All right
-Cool.

987
01:24:33.791 --> 01:24:35.166
-Take a seat.
-Yep.

988
01:24:35.250 --> 01:24:37.708
Yeah. Grab yourself a seat. There. there.

989
01:24:37.791 --> 01:24:39.708
Park yourself up the end there. Henry.

990
01:24:50.791 --> 01:24:53.625
So. I. uh. actually need to

991
01:24:54.625 --> 01:24:58.916
talk to you about this inquest
that you've heard told of…

992
01:24:59.875 --> 01:25:01.458
Heard tell of.

993
01:25:02.416 --> 01:25:05.250
I just need to… to sort that out.

994
01:25:07.666 --> 01:25:09.250
Yeah. uh…

995
01:25:11.166 --> 01:25:12.583
Got a criminal history.

996
01:25:13.666 --> 01:25:15.166
Stealing. uh. bit of violence.

997
01:25:16.625 --> 01:25:17.541
Fuckin' hell.

998
01:25:17.625 --> 01:25:19.416
-Uh…Hey. uh. let me…

999
01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:21.500
-Yeah. John. let me…
-Fuck's sake.

1000
01:25:21.583 --> 01:25:23.291
Yeah. I'll sort it out. Hold on.

1001
01:25:26.125 --> 01:25:27.041
I've got it.

1002
01:25:35.583 --> 01:25:38.166
I… I did time for the violence. you know?

1003
01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:40.416
I was upfront with Mark about that.

1004
01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:42.833
-Wasn't I. mate?
-Yeah. absolutely.

1005
01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:47.208
And I was questioned about
the other thing at the time.

1006
01:25:47.916 --> 01:25:49.041
There we are.

1007
01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:51.250
Nothing came of it.

1008
01:25:51.916 --> 01:25:53.333
Sorry about that.

1009
01:26:01.416 --> 01:26:02.583
Excuse us a minute.

1010
01:26:22.208 --> 01:26:23.625
Where's he gone?

1011
01:26:24.833 --> 01:26:26.125
I don't know.

1012
01:26:29.666 --> 01:26:30.916
I'm gonna go

1013
01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:33.250
see what's going on.

1014
01:26:41.958 --> 01:26:42.833
John.

1015
01:26:45.333 --> 01:26:46.625
You okay. mate?

1016
01:26:47.583 --> 01:26:50.500
Wait outside. Wait in the hall.
I'll call you later.

1017
01:26:52.625 --> 01:26:53.666
Hey. we're. um…

1018
01:26:54.458 --> 01:26:56.708
-I should-- I should be here.
-Mark. Fuck off.

1019
01:26:59.583 --> 01:27:00.750
Yeah. Yep.

1020
01:27:07.166 --> 01:27:08.083
Mm.

1021
01:27:09.541 --> 01:27:11.666
Yeah. all right. then. Um…

1022
01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.208
I'll see what he says.
I'll give him a call then.

1023
01:27:15.291 --> 01:27:16.458
I'll be right back.

1024
01:27:35.208 --> 01:27:36.791
Fuck! Fuck!

1025
01:27:42.875 --> 01:27:43.708
What's going on?

1026
01:27:43.791 --> 01:27:46.041
He's fuckin' falling to pieces
in there. Fuck!

1027
01:27:46.125 --> 01:27:49.125
-Fuck. Hey. hey.

1028
01:27:49.833 --> 01:27:51.916
-<i>…who tell me…</i>
-Fuck.

1029
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.041
<i>-…that you're the one who's responsible…</i>
-Fuck.

1030
01:27:55.875 --> 01:27:59.625
<i>…so you have to tell me</i>
<i>what we need to take care of.</i>

1031
01:27:59.708 --> 01:28:00.833
<i>Nothin' to tell.</i>

1032
01:28:01.541 --> 01:28:06.625
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>What falls on you falls on all of us.</i>

1033
01:28:07.708 --> 01:28:08.625
<i>All right?</i>

1034
01:28:10.625 --> 01:28:14.500
So I received information this morning

1035
01:28:16.333 --> 01:28:19.791
that says you're the one… who's done it.

1036
01:28:21.208 --> 01:28:23.958
And I-- I don't care what you've done.

1037
01:28:24.666 --> 01:28:27.958
whether you done him
or killed him or what have you.

1038
01:28:28.458 --> 01:28:31.500
I mean. there's…
there's nothing you can tell me

1039
01:28:31.583 --> 01:28:32.708
that's gonna upset me.

1040
01:28:34.166 --> 01:28:36.416
What I care about is being lied to.

1041
01:28:37.333 --> 01:28:38.208
I'm not lying.

1042
01:28:38.291 --> 01:28:40.791
You've had every opportunity
to be upfront with us.

1043
01:28:41.666 --> 01:28:42.916
And if you're gonna…

1044
01:28:44.625 --> 01:28:47.708
be dishonest in front of me
and say you had nothin' to do with it.

1045
01:28:47.833 --> 01:28:49.708
-that's not what I've heard.
-Yeah.

1046
01:28:50.583 --> 01:28:55.541
And I'd have no choice but to cut you out
and you'd be back to nothing.

1047
01:28:58.916 --> 01:28:59.916
Yep.

1048
01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:01.333
Yeah.

1049
01:29:03.916 --> 01:29:06.916
And if they put you away for this.
there's nothin' I can do.

1050
01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.750
And there's a…
There's a stigma. there's a…

1051
01:29:10.583 --> 01:29:13.166
there's a… a stigma about
this kind of thing inside.

1052
01:29:15.333 --> 01:29:18.500
So. you know. I can create alibis.

1053
01:29:18.583 --> 01:29:21.375
clear the site.
remove evidence. relocate you.

1054
01:29:21.458 --> 01:29:22.750
I mean. you've seen that.

1055
01:29:26.708 --> 01:29:27.541
All right.

1056
01:29:30.958 --> 01:29:34.083
Sorry. Henry. what was that?

1057
01:29:44.916 --> 01:29:46.791
<i>I killed him. I killed the boy.</i>

1058
01:29:46.875 --> 01:29:49.291
-Jesus Christ. Fuck yes!

1059
01:29:49.375 --> 01:29:51.041
-<i>Well. you know.</i>

1060
01:29:51.750 --> 01:29:53.791
<i>you're gonna have to take me through it</i>

1061
01:29:53.875 --> 01:29:57.291
<i>'cause we need to know</i>
<i>what we have to take care of.</i>

1062
01:30:04.375 --> 01:30:05.208
<i>Uh…</i>

1063
01:30:06.916 --> 01:30:07.916
<i>Uh…</i>

1064
01:30:08.583 --> 01:30:10.333
<i>I saw him waiting at the underpass.</i>

1065
01:30:10.416 --> 01:30:13.541
<i>so I pulled the car over.</i>
<i>and started to chat to him for a while</i>

1066
01:30:13.625 --> 01:30:15.500
<i>and I talked him into the car.</i>

1067
01:30:16.708 --> 01:30:19.333
<i>Cops have taken the car. searched it.</i>

1068
01:30:19.416 --> 01:30:20.583
<i>came back with nothin'.</i>

1069
01:30:21.208 --> 01:30:23.166
<i>They haven't found the body. obviously.</i>

1070
01:30:23.916 --> 01:30:26.458
<i>And where did this happen?</i>

1071
01:30:27.083 --> 01:30:27.958
<i>Just. um…</i>

1072
01:30:38.916 --> 01:30:39.875
What happened?

1073
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.958
John said we've got to go and fuckin'

1074
01:30:44.458 --> 01:30:46.208
wait there in my fuckin' car.

1075
01:30:47.250 --> 01:30:48.666
What? What is it?

1076
01:30:49.166 --> 01:30:51.666
Nothin'. I don't know. Fuck. Uh…

1077
01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:55.125
Just put the work on hold
for a while or something. um.

1078
01:30:55.208 --> 01:30:56.833
while he sorts a few things out.

1079
01:30:56.916 --> 01:30:59.458
-You told him about the airfield?
-Yeah.

1080
01:31:00.375 --> 01:31:03.125
Look. I don't know how much
I can tell you. man. all right?

1081
01:31:08.666 --> 01:31:10.916
<i>He was dead before anyone</i>
<i>knew he was missing.</i>

1082
01:31:12.333 --> 01:31:13.833
Before the police were called.

1083
01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:17.333
Before his family even
started looking. he was dead.

1084
01:31:18.541 --> 01:31:22.166
Detectives will regroup in Queensland
to determine if arrest will be made.

1085
01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:27.458
<i>The undercover operation will continue</i>
<i>with Detective Sergeant Cross</i>

1086
01:31:27.541 --> 01:31:30.166
<i>to return the suspect</i>
<i>to the scene of the offence.</i>

1087
01:31:31.333 --> 01:31:35.583
<i>The site itself will need to be contained</i>
<i>in preparation for a search for evidence.</i>

1088
01:31:37.250 --> 01:31:40.000
<i>Henry.</i>
<i>I'm what's referred to as a cleaner.</i>

1089
01:31:40.583 --> 01:31:43.958
<i>The organization's brought me in</i>
<i>to ensure the police can find nothing</i>

1090
01:31:44.041 --> 01:31:46.666
that could be brought against
you at this new inquest.

1091
01:31:47.166 --> 01:31:50.375
So talk me through it all
and I'll decide the right course for us.

1092
01:31:50.458 --> 01:31:53.125
I read all the press
and reports and that.

1093
01:31:53.916 --> 01:31:56.416
It wasn't a black car.
it wasn't two… two men.

1094
01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:57.875
I was on me own.

1095
01:31:57.958 --> 01:32:01.166
I didn't park at the overpass.
I parked behind it at my old church.

1096
01:32:01.250 --> 01:32:02.958
It happened in an old demountable.

1097
01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:04.333
Uh…

1098
01:32:04.875 --> 01:32:07.333
So here. it's. uh.
about an hour and a half

1099
01:32:07.416 --> 01:32:09.458
north of the city. out in the mountains.

1100
01:32:09.541 --> 01:32:12.291
-It was an old forestry site.
-Where is the demountable?

1101
01:32:14.125 --> 01:32:17.333
Uh. they took it away when…
when they closed the site.

1102
01:32:20.166 --> 01:32:21.541
There's nothin' in it. so--

1103
01:32:21.625 --> 01:32:23.375
Couldn't there be traces in there?

1104
01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.166
No.

1105
01:32:27.250 --> 01:32:28.250
All right.

1106
01:32:31.041 --> 01:32:32.875
Well. what happened after he. um…

1107
01:32:35.166 --> 01:32:36.375
after he died?

1108
01:32:37.250 --> 01:32:40.791
I took him out a bit further. you know.
covered him up with grass. branches.

1109
01:32:40.875 --> 01:32:41.833
that sort of thing.

1110
01:32:41.916 --> 01:32:45.375
Left him there. went back about a week
or two later and he was almost gone.

1111
01:32:45.458 --> 01:32:46.458
What do you mean?

1112
01:32:48.750 --> 01:32:50.291
There were just little pieces of him.

1113
01:32:50.791 --> 01:32:52.666
No. No. we have to find everything.

1114
01:32:52.750 --> 01:32:53.916
What about his clothes?

1115
01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.458
I threw them in the creek.

1116
01:32:55.541 --> 01:32:58.000
-How long ago was this?
-About eight years now.

1117
01:32:58.083 --> 01:32:59.833
Why did you take his clothes off?

1118
01:33:01.250 --> 01:33:02.541
I don't know. Mark.

1119
01:33:04.041 --> 01:33:05.875
I suppose you had to get rid of 'em.

1120
01:33:12.666 --> 01:33:14.041
What have you done then?

1121
01:33:14.125 --> 01:33:15.375
I went home.

1122
01:33:17.125 --> 01:33:18.125
How'd you do it?

1123
01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.958
-How do you mean?
-How'd you kill him?

1124
01:33:22.458 --> 01:33:25.041
-I put my arm around his neck.
-Right. Show us on Mark.

1125
01:33:25.125 --> 01:33:29.166
Mark. can you just pop yourself down
and we'll take a look at that.

1126
01:33:36.166 --> 01:33:37.875
All right.

1127
01:33:55.875 --> 01:33:58.583
All right. Yeah. It doesn't matter.

1128
01:33:59.458 --> 01:34:01.708
-You all right?
-Yeah.

1129
01:34:02.541 --> 01:34:03.791
Yeah.

1130
01:34:11.416 --> 01:34:13.500
-You need to take us there.
-Yeah.

1131
01:34:13.583 --> 01:34:15.666
-Need to clear everything.
-Can Mark come?

1132
01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:16.916
-Yeah.
-Ah.

1133
01:34:17.666 --> 01:34:20.666
It doesn't matter where we sit
as long as we're fuckin' together.

1134
01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:23.875
Like. you know. the same fuckin' row.

1135
01:34:24.958 --> 01:34:27.208
So the flight is sorted.

1136
01:34:28.083 --> 01:34:31.458
Uh. well. he'll call me in five
but I'm gonna go sort the car out.

1137
01:34:33.416 --> 01:34:34.291
Hey.

1138
01:34:35.541 --> 01:34:36.583
Henry.

1139
01:34:37.291 --> 01:34:38.833
Um. I'm gonna…

1140
01:34:39.916 --> 01:34:42.041
Mate. I'm… I'm… Come here.

1141
01:34:42.916 --> 01:34:45.791
Come here. mate. Fuck.
I'm just…

1142
01:34:48.333 --> 01:34:50.166
I'm so proud of you. brother.

1143
01:34:52.208 --> 01:34:53.375
Yeah.

1144
01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.416
<i>This briefing</i>
<i>has been called to determine</i>

1145
01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:18.041
<i>whether an arrest</i>
<i>should be made of Peter Morley.</i>

1146
01:35:18.125 --> 01:35:20.208
<i>otherwise known as Henry Peter Teague.</i>

1147
01:35:20.291 --> 01:35:22.916
in the abduction and murder
of James Liston.

1148
01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.833
eight years ago on the 12th of May. 2002.

1149
01:35:28.333 --> 01:35:29.541
<i>As you're all aware.</i>

1150
01:35:29.625 --> 01:35:33.000
<i>this is the largest missing-persons case</i>
<i>in the history of our state</i>

1151
01:35:33.708 --> 01:35:36.083
<i>and is one of the largest</i>
<i>in the history of our country.</i>

1152
01:35:36.166 --> 01:35:38.125
-I'm going to the bathroom.

1153
01:35:38.666 --> 01:35:41.166
<i>The investigation has</i>
<i>spanned over eight years</i>

1154
01:35:41.250 --> 01:35:43.416
<i>and is one of the largest joint operations</i>

1155
01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:46.333
<i>ever undertaken by interstate agencies.</i>

1156
01:35:46.416 --> 01:35:50.250
Peter Morley was born to a normal.
middle-class military family.

1157
01:35:51.166 --> 01:35:56.125
There is no evidence to suggest as a child
Peter Morley was the subject of abuse.

1158
01:36:02.583 --> 01:36:05.666
<i>This investigation</i>
<i>has completely disproved Morley's alibi…</i>

1159
01:36:06.416 --> 01:36:08.000
He's just gone to the bathroom.

1160
01:36:08.625 --> 01:36:10.458
<i>…and has</i>
<i>unearthed the full details</i>

1161
01:36:10.541 --> 01:36:14.083
<i>of his previous assault of a child</i>
<i>in the Northern Territory</i>

1162
01:36:14.166 --> 01:36:16.291
<i>for which he served two years in jail.</i>

1163
01:36:17.791 --> 01:36:18.791
Lights. please.

1164
01:36:23.708 --> 01:36:28.958
This child was taken from
a family crisis center in the NT in 1996.

1165
01:36:30.166 --> 01:36:31.833
He was not known to the offender.

1166
01:36:33.708 --> 01:36:35.791
Attending doctors observed that the child

1167
01:36:35.875 --> 01:36:41.041
had lacerations and abrasions
to his legs. arms and torso.

1168
01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:46.250
His hair. face and body
were covered in dirt.

1169
01:36:47.125 --> 01:36:49.375
with blood present in the nose and mouth.

1170
01:36:50.583 --> 01:36:52.166
He had blackened eyes.

1171
01:36:53.416 --> 01:36:54.916
several closed fractures.

1172
01:36:55.750 --> 01:36:57.041
a collapsed lung.

1173
01:36:58.291 --> 01:37:00.416
severe bruises beneath his hairline.

1174
01:37:02.166 --> 01:37:04.583
and deep cuts to his scalp and genitalia.

1175
01:37:06.625 --> 01:37:10.541
The overall pattern indicated
widespread and repeated applications

1176
01:37:11.041 --> 01:37:14.541
of both blunt and sharp-force trauma.

1177
01:37:16.375 --> 01:37:18.375
Contusions to the throat

1178
01:37:18.458 --> 01:37:21.250
in association with
hemorrhaging in the eyes

1179
01:37:21.333 --> 01:37:22.958
was indicative of suffocation.

1180
01:37:24.083 --> 01:37:27.916
He was found barely alive
in the remnants of a burnt-out car

1181
01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.333
less than 100 meters
from where he was taken.

1182
01:37:32.458 --> 01:37:34.583
On returning to the site of the abduction.

1183
01:37:34.666 --> 01:37:38.583
Peter Morley offered to lead the search
for the person responsible.

1184
01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.125
-Hello?

1185
01:37:43.375 --> 01:37:44.958
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

1186
01:37:45.666 --> 01:37:46.916
-Sorry.
-Nah.

1187
01:37:53.458 --> 01:37:54.666
Thought you'd fallen in.

1188
01:37:57.916 --> 01:38:00.625
I can't fuckin' breathe. man.
I can't fuckin' breathe.

1189
01:38:01.583 --> 01:38:02.583
-Yeah. you can.
-Nah.

1190
01:38:02.666 --> 01:38:03.541
Yeah. you can.

1191
01:38:04.083 --> 01:38:06.291
Ready?

1192
01:38:10.958 --> 01:38:12.833
I want to
raise a few issues here.

1193
01:38:12.916 --> 01:38:14.875
Regardless of his assault
on this other child.

1194
01:38:14.958 --> 01:38:16.833
in this case. the timelines are thin.

1195
01:38:17.708 --> 01:38:19.375
even with the break in his alibi.

1196
01:38:19.458 --> 01:38:23.333
We're talking about an hour
to abduct a person--

1197
01:38:23.416 --> 01:38:25.583
I have to be clear.
this is a practiced offender

1198
01:38:25.666 --> 01:38:28.541
-who's placed himself at the scene--
-You've been clear.

1199
01:38:28.625 --> 01:38:31.708
-You've had your time. Now sit down.
-I want to clarify something.

1200
01:38:31.791 --> 01:38:33.541
Let's have some contention in the process.

1201
01:38:33.625 --> 01:38:36.958
I want to clarify something.
The duration of the assault in the NT?

1202
01:38:39.125 --> 01:38:40.333
Fifteen minutes.

1203
01:38:45.833 --> 01:38:48.916
There's never been anyone
locked up in Queensland without a body.

1204
01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.083
New South Wales there has. Not here.

1205
01:38:51.166 --> 01:38:56.000
I. um… I mentioned the yard
where you talked about shredding the cars.

1206
01:38:56.416 --> 01:38:58.625
Is that somewhere that we should head to?

1207
01:38:58.708 --> 01:39:01.291
-Nah. mate.
-I just thought maybe--

1208
01:39:01.375 --> 01:39:02.458
No. Mark. no.

1209
01:39:05.333 --> 01:39:07.000
What were you wearing on the day?

1210
01:39:07.083 --> 01:39:10.083
I threw it all on the fire.
burnt it all. shoes as well.

1211
01:39:11.041 --> 01:39:13.750
-There's nothing left?
-Nothing left. Nothing.

1212
01:39:13.833 --> 01:39:16.750
-Where are the ashes?
-I threw them out on the lawn

1213
01:39:16.833 --> 01:39:19.458
and then I got the dirt
ripped up and taken away. so…

1214
01:39:19.541 --> 01:39:21.000
Fuckin' well done.

1215
01:39:21.083 --> 01:39:23.083
That's gold. Fuckin' gold.

1216
01:39:23.375 --> 01:39:26.708
I didn't mean to do it. though.
I didn't know it would happen.

1217
01:39:26.791 --> 01:39:29.291
It's like how the words
are coming out of me mouth now.

1218
01:39:29.375 --> 01:39:31.750
like how I'm saying it to you now.
like it's nothing.

1219
01:39:34.625 --> 01:39:37.000
-How far from here?
-Not far.

1220
01:39:37.916 --> 01:39:39.541
That's my old church there.

1221
01:39:39.625 --> 01:39:41.000
That's where I was married.

1222
01:39:41.083 --> 01:39:44.083
Don't know what I was fuckin'
thinkin' of at the time.

1223
01:39:45.166 --> 01:39:46.208
Yeah.

1224
01:39:46.291 --> 01:39:48.625
-This is where I picked him up. here.

1225
01:39:49.791 --> 01:39:52.750
No. don't fuckin' pull over.
There's a camera there.

1226
01:39:52.833 --> 01:39:54.458
There's a camera there. mate.

1227
01:39:54.541 --> 01:39:55.625
Just keep going.

1228
01:39:59.375 --> 01:40:01.708
<i>This isn't</i>
<i>about whether he did it.</i>

1229
01:40:01.791 --> 01:40:04.500
<i>It's about whether</i>
<i>or not it's prosecutable.</i>

1230
01:40:05.125 --> 01:40:08.250
And you can talk about
an unsolicited confession all you like.

1231
01:40:08.333 --> 01:40:12.041
This undercover operation
induces a suspect to confess.

1232
01:40:12.916 --> 01:40:15.541
It's inducement without evidence.

1233
01:40:17.041 --> 01:40:19.166
This is where I threw his clothes.

1234
01:40:20.625 --> 01:40:22.041
There's nothing here.

1235
01:40:24.458 --> 01:40:25.375
That's good.

1236
01:40:27.791 --> 01:40:30.500
I strongly submit that we
continue the covert operation

1237
01:40:30.583 --> 01:40:32.166
while the area's being searched

1238
01:40:32.250 --> 01:40:34.625
because if you go for
an arrest without evidence

1239
01:40:34.708 --> 01:40:36.666
and you find nothing. he walks.

1240
01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:41.125
I refuse to put the victim's family
through that for nothing.

1241
01:40:41.208 --> 01:40:43.666
As you're aware.
the commissioner has tasked me

1242
01:40:43.750 --> 01:40:46.875
with making a decision as to whether
or not an arrest is to take place.

1243
01:40:46.958 --> 01:40:48.541
Without evidence. he walks.

1244
01:40:49.750 --> 01:40:52.000
And that will be
my decision to make.

1245
01:41:03.708 --> 01:41:05.250
Just pull in up there.

1246
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Is this it?

1247
01:41:18.041 --> 01:41:18.958
Yep.

1248
01:41:28.791 --> 01:41:31.000
So this is where
the demountable was?

1249
01:41:32.875 --> 01:41:35.000
-Yeah.
-So you killed him in there…

1250
01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:39.333
and you dragged him down where?

1251
01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:23.833
I don't remember that water being there.

1252
01:42:27.291 --> 01:42:28.500
It was here though.

1253
01:42:30.333 --> 01:42:31.333
Here.

1254
01:42:34.875 --> 01:42:35.833
You sure?

1255
01:42:45.583 --> 01:42:46.875
Yeah. there's nothing.

1256
01:43:03.416 --> 01:43:04.583
It's all right.

1257
01:43:07.208 --> 01:43:08.208
It's all right.

1258
01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.708
<i>Hold it there!</i>
<i>Hold it there!</i>

1259
01:43:13.791 --> 01:43:16.250
<i>Stay where you are. mate!</i>
<i>Just stay where you are!</i>

1260
01:44:32.500 --> 01:44:34.208
Thank you all for your attendance.

1261
01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:39.750
I'll let you know at the outset that
we won't be able to answer any questions.

1262
01:44:39.833 --> 01:44:42.208
<i>I can confirm that earlier today.</i>
<i>an arrest was made</i>

1263
01:44:42.291 --> 01:44:46.041
<i>in relation to the disappearance</i>
<i>of James Liston on May 12. 2002.</i>

1264
01:44:46.125 --> 01:44:50.208
<i>Police are currently securing a large area</i>
<i>in anticipation of an extensive search.</i>

1265
01:44:57.791 --> 01:45:01.500
<i>The search area itself</i>
<i>is located in the Queensland floodplain.</i>

1266
01:45:01.583 --> 01:45:05.416
<i>The issue that we are facing</i>
<i>is that flooding over the past eight years</i>

1267
01:45:05.500 --> 01:45:07.625
<i>may have removed any remaining evidence.</i>

1268
01:45:16.541 --> 01:45:17.833
Henry Teague.

1269
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.458
As informed earlier.

1270
01:45:20.541 --> 01:45:23.500
you're here under arrest with regard
to the abduction of James Liston

1271
01:45:23.583 --> 01:45:24.750
on the 12th May. 2002.

1272
01:45:24.833 --> 01:45:27.875
I haven't done this. you know.
Nothin' to do with me. mate.

1273
01:45:28.500 --> 01:45:30.708
As long as you didn't do it.
there'll be no evidence

1274
01:45:30.791 --> 01:45:32.958
and you've got nothing to worry about.

1275
01:45:33.041 --> 01:45:35.500
Now. you got a minute.
Anything you need?

1276
01:45:36.583 --> 01:45:37.791
Anyone got a smoke?

1277
01:46:23.333 --> 01:46:26.666
<i>We'll be undertaking</i>
<i>a basic search of the forest covering.</i>

1278
01:46:26.750 --> 01:46:29.416
<i>We have around four acres to manage.</i>

1279
01:46:38.541 --> 01:46:41.083
<i>Additional Forensics are</i>
<i>searching the demountable</i>

1280
01:46:41.166 --> 01:46:43.333
<i>which was relocated when the site sold</i>

1281
01:46:43.416 --> 01:46:45.916
<i>and where it's alleged</i>
<i>that the victim was killed.</i>

1282
01:46:52.416 --> 01:46:54.416
<i>Don't disturb potential evidence.</i>

1283
01:46:55.208 --> 01:46:59.625
If you come across anything.
pause and raise your hand.

1284
01:48:12.416 --> 01:48:14.958
-How we looking?
-Found nothing.

1285
01:48:15.041 --> 01:48:16.125
-Nothing at all?
-No.

1286
01:48:16.208 --> 01:48:18.708
The divers have finished with
the lake. but no. nothing.

1287
01:48:18.791 --> 01:48:19.791
Right.

1288
01:51:12.666 --> 01:51:13.666
No. hold on.

1289
01:51:34.875 --> 01:51:36.083
<i>It's night.</i>

1290
01:51:38.083 --> 01:51:39.416
<i>I'm in my house.</i>

1291
01:51:41.500 --> 01:51:43.500
<i>My son is asleep in his room.</i>

1292
01:51:46.125 --> 01:51:47.541
<i>And I hear a voice.</i>

1293
01:51:49.500 --> 01:51:51.416
<i>It's coming from downstairs.</i>

1294
01:51:53.958 --> 01:51:55.250
<i>I walk toward it.</i>

1295
01:51:58.333 --> 01:51:59.750
<i>I can barely breathe.</i>

1296
01:52:02.750 --> 01:52:04.375
<i>It's not a person talking.</i>

1297
01:52:06.583 --> 01:52:08.375
<i>It's a tape recorder.</i>

1298
01:52:11.166 --> 01:52:13.208
<i>I press the button to turn it off.</i>

1299
01:52:15.083 --> 01:52:16.541
<i>But when I turn it off…</i>

1300
01:52:18.750 --> 01:52:20.375
<i>the voice keeps coming…</i>

1301
01:52:23.041 --> 01:52:24.208
<i>…keeps talking.</i>
