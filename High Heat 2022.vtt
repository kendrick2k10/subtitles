3
00:02:38.636 --> 00:02:40.682
Come on.
Let'’s go. Marie?

4
00:02:41.944 --> 00:02:42.988
The 6:30s are here.

5
00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:44.076
The serving staff
is on the floor.

6
00:02:44.251 --> 00:02:45.556
It'’s time.

7
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.079
Perhaps you should
say something?

8
00:02:47.254 --> 00:02:49.473
Ordering
one hamachi crudo.
two salad niçoises

9
00:02:49.647 --> 00:02:51.040
and one striped bass.

10
00:02:51.214 --> 00:02:52.694
Merde!Sebastian.Huh?

11
00:02:52.868 --> 00:02:54.870
We eighty-sixed the bass
an hour ago.

12
00:02:55.044 --> 00:02:57.699
Why is table 42
expecting something
we can'’t deliver?

13
00:02:57.873 --> 00:02:59.353
There was
a miscommunication.

14
00:02:59.527 --> 00:03:00.658
"Miscommunication."

15
00:03:00.832 --> 00:03:02.269
I speak four languages.

16
00:03:02.443 --> 00:03:03.879
and you'’re talking to me
about miscommunication?

17
00:03:04.053 --> 00:03:05.141
Calm down.

18
00:03:05.315 --> 00:03:06.795
Your face will scare
the customers.

19
00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:08.797
My kitchen. my face.
my rules.

20
00:03:08.971 --> 00:03:10.102
And what'’s
my rule number one?

21
00:03:10.277 --> 00:03:11.321
Do not fuck
with your kitchen.

22
00:03:11.495 --> 00:03:12.583
Voilà.

23
00:03:12.757 --> 00:03:13.976
Service!

24
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.805
Welcome to Etoile Rouge.
Right this way.

25
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:32.299
Bon appétit.

26
00:03:37.478 --> 00:03:39.871
All right.
How much longer until
I have my veggies done?

27
00:03:41.133 --> 00:03:42.657
Come on. guys.
I need them faster. Come on.

28
00:03:42.831 --> 00:03:44.093
Chef Ana?Yes?

29
00:03:44.267 --> 00:03:45.703
The patrons could
really use some face time.

30
00:03:45.877 --> 00:03:47.531
I don'’t have the time.They paid for a meal.

31
00:03:47.705 --> 00:03:49.359
but they also paid
to be schmoozed.

32
00:03:49.533 --> 00:03:50.708
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
Wait. wait. wait.

33
00:03:50.882 --> 00:03:51.753
Show it to me.

34
00:03:51.927 --> 00:03:53.015
No. No. No.

35
00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:55.104
No. no. no. no. no.
No. no. no.

36
00:03:55.278 --> 00:03:57.846
Look. the beurre blanc
is separated.

37
00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.587
Oui. Chef.

38
00:03:59.761 --> 00:04:01.153
It might taste the same.
but I know.

39
00:04:01.328 --> 00:04:03.504
and you really should know.
it'’s not right.

40
00:04:03.678 --> 00:04:04.896
Oui. Chef.

41
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.072
Let me show you. okay?

42
00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:09.510
And then quickly.
but no rush.

43
00:04:09.684 --> 00:04:11.468
Yes. Of course.Like this. Yeah?

44
00:04:11.642 --> 00:04:12.643
Yes.Try.

45
00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:16.560
Faster.
As fast as you can.

46
00:04:16.734 --> 00:04:17.953
Sorry.

47
00:04:18.127 --> 00:04:20.129
Don'’t apologize.
Just practice.

48
00:04:20.303 --> 00:04:22.349
Good. Good.

49
00:04:22.523 --> 00:04:24.873
Practice until
you can do it in your sleep.

50
00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.795
Good evening. Chef.Good evening. husband.

51
00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:35.666
I told him not to.

52
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.059
You must be lost. Ray.

53
00:04:37.233 --> 00:04:38.147
The bar is in front.

54
00:04:38.321 --> 00:04:39.540
Aren'’t you funny?

55
00:04:39.714 --> 00:04:41.281
You must be the first
Frenchman in history

56
00:04:41.455 --> 00:04:43.065
not to back down from a fight.

57
00:04:43.239 --> 00:04:45.546
Okay. that'’s enough.
Back to work.

58
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.113
Et toi. ma chérie.
You'’re fired.

59
00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:49.898
You can'’t fire the owner.

60
00:04:50.072 --> 00:04:53.162
Half owner.
and this half is mine.
so out.

61
00:04:53.336 --> 00:04:54.685
I come bearing gifts.

62
00:04:54.859 --> 00:04:56.470
No.
Put it in the freezer.No. no--

63
00:04:56.644 --> 00:04:57.819
That'’s your answer
for everything.

64
00:04:57.993 --> 00:04:59.342
I think you better
take a look at this.

65
00:05:09.134 --> 00:05:10.527
It'’s nice. isn'’t it?

66
00:05:10.701 --> 00:05:12.312
How--
How did you do this?

67
00:05:12.486 --> 00:05:14.488
You have your talents.
I have mine.

68
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.579
You better be ready
to get real busy.

69
00:05:20.015 --> 00:05:20.755
Well done. Ray.

70
00:05:20.929 --> 00:05:22.626
Oh. thanks. Frenchman.

71
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.150
Coming from you.
that'’s a-- a compliment.

72
00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:28.023
Come on. You gotta
go show your face
to the hungry people.

73
00:05:28.197 --> 00:05:29.372
Oh. no. no. no. darling.
I'’m busy.

74
00:05:29.546 --> 00:05:31.113
Look.
I'’m preparing the--

75
00:05:31.287 --> 00:05:33.289
Hey. I'’ve been bragging
about you all night out there.

76
00:05:33.463 --> 00:05:34.899
If you don'’t come with me
and show your face.

77
00:05:35.073 --> 00:05:36.553
they'’re gonna think
I'’m a loser. Come on.

78
00:05:36.727 --> 00:05:38.686
You know I prefer
the kitchen. not--

79
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:39.948
I know. the spotlight.

80
00:05:40.122 --> 00:05:42.603
But you gotta meet
the hungry people.

81
00:05:42.777 --> 00:05:45.649
So
this Parisian chef says.

82
00:05:45.823 --> 00:05:48.130
"If you don'’t come back
with 50 pounds of salmon.

83
00:05:48.304 --> 00:05:50.350
you'’re gonna have
a hundred pounds of
pissed-off Russian."

84
00:05:52.221 --> 00:05:54.005
So I said.
"Tell me more."

85
00:05:54.179 --> 00:05:55.877
And that'’s how I met my wife.

86
00:05:56.051 --> 00:05:57.313
There you have it.

87
00:05:57.487 --> 00:06:00.664
Set up on a blind date
by a dead fish. Enjoy.

88
00:06:04.929 --> 00:06:06.366
Get the back door open.

89
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:07.758
Open the back door!

90
00:06:07.932 --> 00:06:09.934
Out of the way! Idiot!

91
00:06:10.108 --> 00:06:11.066
What'’s going on?

92
00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:13.285
What'’s happening here. guys?

93
00:06:15.157 --> 00:06:16.114
What'’s happening?

94
00:06:16.288 --> 00:06:17.681
Back to work.
all of you!

95
00:06:17.855 --> 00:06:19.248
The first night.
and we'’re messing it all up!

96
00:06:19.422 --> 00:06:20.641
Chef.Yes.

97
00:06:20.815 --> 00:06:23.165
Uh. phone for you.

98
00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:24.384
Sebastian. come on.

99
00:06:24.558 --> 00:06:25.733
Try not to burn
the kitchen down.

100
00:06:25.907 --> 00:06:27.474
It'’s the first day.

101
00:06:27.648 --> 00:06:30.128
Hello? Hello?

102
00:06:42.097 --> 00:06:43.577
Everything
all right. Chef?

103
00:06:43.751 --> 00:06:45.666
Huh? Yes. Yes.

104
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.668
Everything'’s fine.

105
00:06:47.842 --> 00:06:51.019
As long as the restaurant
doesn'’t burn. we'’re good.

106
00:06:51.193 --> 00:06:52.760
Let'’s get back to work.
Come on.

107
00:06:52.934 --> 00:06:54.631
Oui. Chef.

108
00:06:54.805 --> 00:06:55.806
Imbeciles!

109
00:06:56.894 --> 00:06:58.679
Back to work.
all of you.

110
00:06:58.853 --> 00:07:00.724
I'’m gonna go out
on the sidewalk.

111
00:07:00.898 --> 00:07:03.423
tell the waiters
that it'’s safe
to come back in.

112
00:07:05.468 --> 00:07:09.080
I am so sorry. ma'’am.
We are all booked for tonight.

113
00:07:09.254 --> 00:07:12.301
I'’m telling you.
Paris was insane.

114
00:07:12.475 --> 00:07:13.694
We'’d walk out of the clubs.

115
00:07:13.868 --> 00:07:15.739
we'’d all be drunk
and stumbling around.

116
00:07:15.913 --> 00:07:18.568
I mean. it was one party
right after another.

117
00:07:18.742 --> 00:07:20.440
Richard.
it'’s getting late.

118
00:07:21.571 --> 00:07:22.790
Well. thanks
for the drink. Ray.

119
00:07:22.964 --> 00:07:24.313
Ah. pleasure.Nice to meet you.

120
00:07:24.487 --> 00:07:26.228
Ah. look after yourself.

121
00:07:27.185 --> 00:07:28.796
We have reached
our turnover early.

122
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:30.275
Can I start taking walk-ins?

123
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:31.973
No. No walk-ins.

124
00:07:32.147 --> 00:07:34.366
I'’d rather be in the red
than to take walk-ins.

125
00:07:34.541 --> 00:07:35.759
Fully booked.

126
00:07:35.933 --> 00:07:37.065
That'’s what we show
the world tonight.

127
00:07:37.239 --> 00:07:38.545
Okay. I'’ll turn away
this two-top.

128
00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:40.677
Ah. ah. ah. ah. Guests.

129
00:07:40.851 --> 00:07:42.679
Not a two-top.
not a four-top.

130
00:07:42.853 --> 00:07:44.333
We'’re not an Applebee'’s.

131
00:07:44.507 --> 00:07:45.856
You'’re in
the big leagues now.

132
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:47.336
My fault.

133
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.120
Guests. right.

134
00:07:49.294 --> 00:07:50.470
I'’ll take care
of these two.

135
00:07:53.429 --> 00:07:56.345
Why don'’t you get
drinks for that two-top
you just seated?

136
00:08:00.175 --> 00:08:01.742
Ray. you handsome devil.

137
00:08:03.744 --> 00:08:05.354
I mean. this place is...

138
00:08:05.528 --> 00:08:06.529
Wow.

139
00:08:07.356 --> 00:08:08.400
Thanks. Mickey.

140
00:08:09.358 --> 00:08:10.402
What'’s up. fellas?

141
00:08:12.448 --> 00:08:13.971
We'’re starving.

142
00:08:14.145 --> 00:08:15.799
Just have your mama
cook for you.

143
00:08:15.973 --> 00:08:17.061
That'’s fucked up.

144
00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:23.415
You know.
my mother'’s dead.
God rest her soul.

145
00:08:24.416 --> 00:08:25.592
What do you want?

146
00:08:28.159 --> 00:08:30.074
Dom wants to talk.

147
00:08:30.248 --> 00:08:31.685
Tell him I'’ll call him
in the morning.

148
00:08:31.859 --> 00:08:33.251
That'’s not gonna work.

149
00:08:34.775 --> 00:08:36.733
Come on. bozo. Look around.

150
00:08:36.907 --> 00:08:39.040
We'’re busy. It'’s a bad time.

151
00:08:40.432 --> 00:08:41.869
He wants to talk now.

152
00:08:45.394 --> 00:08:47.309
Just tell him I'’ll call him
in the morning.

153
00:08:47.483 --> 00:08:49.616
Yeah.
he'’s not gonna do that.

154
00:08:53.054 --> 00:08:54.621
Come on. We'’re friends.

155
00:08:54.795 --> 00:08:57.928
I'’ll talk to him.
and it'’ll all work out.

156
00:08:58.102 --> 00:08:59.451
It'’s tonight. Ray.

157
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:03.934
Mickey. Come on. man.

158
00:09:04.108 --> 00:09:05.240
It'’s opening night.

159
00:09:05.414 --> 00:09:07.503
It'’s opening night.

160
00:09:09.157 --> 00:09:12.029
I don'’t give a shit
if it'’s opening night.

161
00:09:12.203 --> 00:09:13.117
Listen to me.

162
00:09:13.291 --> 00:09:15.250
It'’s tonight.

163
00:09:15.424 --> 00:09:19.689
Dom told me tonight.
I told you it'’s tonight.

164
00:09:19.863 --> 00:09:22.910
And you always do what Daddy
tells you to do. don'’t you?

165
00:09:25.782 --> 00:09:27.828
I'’m next in line. Ray.
Show a little respect.

166
00:09:28.002 --> 00:09:29.830
Respect is earned.

167
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:39.796
I'’ll talk to him
in the morning.

168
00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:42.103
We'’ll work it out.
Don'’t worry.

169
00:09:44.192 --> 00:09:45.585
Tonight. Ray.

170
00:09:50.372 --> 00:09:51.765
Let'’s get outta here.

171
00:09:55.203 --> 00:09:57.379
Terminé.

172
00:09:57.553 --> 00:09:59.163
Speech. speech.

173
00:09:59.337 --> 00:10:01.339
Speech. speech.
speech. speech.

174
00:10:01.513 --> 00:10:04.647
Okay.
Thank you.

175
00:10:04.821 --> 00:10:07.432
Uh. this place is what
I'’ve always wanted.

176
00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:11.132
Um. and it'’s thanks to you
that I stand here.

177
00:10:11.306 --> 00:10:13.656
the proud owner
of Etoile Rouge.

178
00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:15.092
Half owner.

179
00:10:15.266 --> 00:10:16.790
This is a special night.

180
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:21.098
And hopefully
just the beginning.

181
00:10:22.317 --> 00:10:24.667
And. yeah. thank you. guys.

182
00:10:24.841 --> 00:10:28.323
Thank you
for not fucking it up.

183
00:10:31.935 --> 00:10:33.763
So let'’s celebrate.

184
00:10:33.937 --> 00:10:36.418
That is all.
ladies and gentlemen.

185
00:10:36.592 --> 00:10:39.551
The kitchen is now closed.
Let'’s drink.

186
00:10:39.726 --> 00:10:41.031
Na zdorovie.

187
00:10:44.034 --> 00:10:46.733
Hey. boss. are we gonna
do this or what?

188
00:10:52.695 --> 00:10:54.915
I left my dad a message.

189
00:10:55.089 --> 00:10:57.526
We'’re not doing nothing
till he gets back to me.

190
00:10:58.614 --> 00:11:00.137
He did say
it was tonight.

191
00:11:03.227 --> 00:11:04.359
Yeah.

192
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.666
I know what he said.

193
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.756
He said it to me. genius.
I told you that.

194
00:11:11.192 --> 00:11:12.628
I'’m just saying.

195
00:11:14.412 --> 00:11:15.413
So...

196
00:11:17.633 --> 00:11:19.200
we'’re just gonna wait here?

197
00:11:19.374 --> 00:11:22.682
Did I fucking stutter? Huh?

198
00:11:26.381 --> 00:11:27.904
He'’s getting a massage.

199
00:11:28.078 --> 00:11:29.819
and when he'’s getting
a massage.

200
00:11:29.993 --> 00:11:31.647
he don'’t like to be bothered.

201
00:11:34.128 --> 00:11:35.346
It ruins the mood.

202
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.003
I never
got a massage before.

203
00:11:40.177 --> 00:11:42.614
You gotta do
those things naked?

204
00:11:44.442 --> 00:11:47.010
Why the fuck
would you go naked?

205
00:11:47.881 --> 00:11:49.186
I heard you gotta
do it naked.

206
00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.493
Just shut up.
Everybody shut up.

207
00:11:53.321 --> 00:11:56.324
And get off the fucking car.
I just had it washed.

208
00:12:00.676 --> 00:12:03.505
That Ray.
Some balls on that guy. huh?

209
00:12:04.593 --> 00:12:07.291
Yeah. Not for long.

210
00:12:07.465 --> 00:12:08.771
Yeah.

211
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.252
I'’d like to see that.

212
00:12:13.297 --> 00:12:15.386
Oh. you'’re gonna see
something. lollipop.

213
00:12:16.561 --> 00:12:18.825
Okay. we'’ll see.Yeah. lollipop.

214
00:12:23.133 --> 00:12:24.091
Cheers.

215
00:12:28.008 --> 00:12:30.010
It'’s disgusting.

216
00:12:32.403 --> 00:12:33.448
How does it feel?

217
00:12:34.362 --> 00:12:35.276
What do you mean?

218
00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:37.017
To have your own place.

219
00:12:37.191 --> 00:12:38.932
Yeah. it feels good.
Um...

220
00:12:39.933 --> 00:12:41.456
A little stressful.

221
00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:43.110
Ay. caramba.

222
00:12:43.284 --> 00:12:45.025
You did it. Ana.

223
00:12:45.199 --> 00:12:48.419
I know you can'’t
tell right now.
but you did it.

224
00:12:48.593 --> 00:12:49.943
This is the start
of something--

225
00:12:50.117 --> 00:12:51.509
CÇa va. Sebastian?

226
00:12:59.735 --> 00:13:02.782
So...
...did you always
wanna be a chef?

227
00:13:04.435 --> 00:13:06.829
No. Not always. no.

228
00:13:08.744 --> 00:13:11.486
Well. you'’re really
good at it.

229
00:13:13.009 --> 00:13:13.967
Thank you.

230
00:13:14.924 --> 00:13:16.578
You know. it'’s not just me.

231
00:13:16.752 --> 00:13:18.493
Ray has done so much for me.

232
00:13:18.667 --> 00:13:19.799
Mmm.

233
00:13:21.322 --> 00:13:24.978
And I'’m sure
he'’s somewhere here.

234
00:13:25.152 --> 00:13:27.241
supporting me. right?

235
00:13:28.938 --> 00:13:32.594
Whoa.
That'’s some
pretty good stuff. Ricky.

236
00:13:32.768 --> 00:13:34.335
All right.
I got a second wind.

237
00:13:34.509 --> 00:13:35.945
Let'’s go.

238
00:13:36.119 --> 00:13:37.904
I think we gotta get home.
It'’s getting late.

239
00:13:38.078 --> 00:13:40.167
Aw. come on.
We just got started. man.

240
00:13:40.341 --> 00:13:41.777
Well. I'’m out of money.

241
00:13:41.951 --> 00:13:44.780
Here. Problem solved.

242
00:13:44.954 --> 00:13:47.087
Sorry. Ray.
We gotta get going.

243
00:13:47.261 --> 00:13:48.958
Party'’s over.

244
00:13:49.132 --> 00:13:51.308
Give them their tips back
and go home.

245
00:13:52.222 --> 00:13:54.137
There you go. guys.

246
00:13:54.311 --> 00:13:56.400
Leave me enough
for cab fare. will you?

247
00:13:56.574 --> 00:13:58.011
And I mean you too. huh?

248
00:13:59.186 --> 00:14:00.927
Wanna play a game.
just you and me?

249
00:14:01.101 --> 00:14:02.885
Well. you know.
I gotta work.

250
00:14:03.059 --> 00:14:05.105
I need to prepare
demiglace for tomorrow.

251
00:14:05.888 --> 00:14:06.933
You never stop.

252
00:14:07.934 --> 00:14:09.370
All right.
I'’ll see you when I see you.

253
00:14:09.544 --> 00:14:11.198
Mm-hmm. Beso.

254
00:14:11.372 --> 00:14:13.156
Don'’t be all night.Mmm.

255
00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:14.592
Good night.

256
00:14:14.766 --> 00:14:16.029
I'’ll walk you out.

257
00:14:16.203 --> 00:14:17.682
Eliza. how did we do?

258
00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:20.598
Everything was great.
Cash till looks promising.

259
00:14:20.772 --> 00:14:21.948
Great. Thank you.

260
00:14:22.122 --> 00:14:23.601
You'’re staying?

261
00:14:23.775 --> 00:14:26.822
Oh. she'’s gonna smoke
and pace and pace and smoke.

262
00:14:26.996 --> 00:14:28.693
She gets all jacked up
on the adrenaline.

263
00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:30.957
Mm-hmm. Well. at least
that'’s all I'’m jacked up on.

264
00:14:31.131 --> 00:14:32.132
Oh.

265
00:14:32.306 --> 00:14:33.829
Good night.

266
00:15:09.996 --> 00:15:11.780
My feet are killing me.

267
00:15:11.954 --> 00:15:13.913
What you ladies
put up with is crazy.

268
00:15:16.132 --> 00:15:17.655
Look who it is.Oh. shit.

269
00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:19.440
Aren'’t those the two guys
for the restaurant?

270
00:15:19.614 --> 00:15:22.573
A legend.
Who'’s the hooker?

271
00:15:24.358 --> 00:15:26.186
Isn'’t it past
your bedtime. Mickey?

272
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.536
Now.
why you gotta be
crazy like that?

273
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:30.190
I let you have
your big night out.

274
00:15:30.364 --> 00:15:32.453
Now. come on.
I'’ve had it up to here
with you.

275
00:15:32.627 --> 00:15:33.976
Come on. Go home.

276
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:35.978
This is between me and Dom.

277
00:15:36.152 --> 00:15:37.980
I'’ll work something out.

278
00:15:38.154 --> 00:15:40.983
Well. he sent me
to handle it.

279
00:15:43.507 --> 00:15:44.987
So I'’m handling it.

280
00:15:48.382 --> 00:15:49.383
Ray.

281
00:15:49.557 --> 00:15:51.863
Freaks come out
at night. baby.

282
00:15:55.432 --> 00:15:56.956
All right.

283
00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:59.784
Enough of this
take-your-child-
to-work-day bullshit.

284
00:16:01.308 --> 00:16:02.962
You know. I think
all of this Viagra

285
00:16:03.136 --> 00:16:05.486
has caused you
some serious hearing loss.

286
00:16:06.661 --> 00:16:08.924
It'’s tonight. lollipop.

287
00:16:09.098 --> 00:16:10.926
Yeah. All right. Mickey.
Whatever you say.

288
00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.493
What are they talking about?Nothing.

289
00:16:12.667 --> 00:16:14.625
They'’re talking about nothing.
They just talk.

290
00:16:22.198 --> 00:16:23.112
Oops.

291
00:16:23.286 --> 00:16:24.418
Thanks.

292
00:16:26.202 --> 00:16:28.552
She'’ll be fine.

293
00:16:30.032 --> 00:16:31.164
Let'’s go. Ray.

294
00:16:32.948 --> 00:16:34.254
I'’m not fucking around.
Ray.

295
00:16:34.428 --> 00:16:36.865
Ray! Let'’s go.

296
00:17:20.126 --> 00:17:21.301
Be careful.
It'’s heavy.

297
00:17:21.475 --> 00:17:22.954
Yeah.
I know it'’s heavy.

298
00:17:25.348 --> 00:17:26.871
I am using my back!

299
00:17:30.179 --> 00:17:31.398
Look.
the lights are still on.

300
00:17:31.572 --> 00:17:32.834
Yeah. and?

301
00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:35.489
It smells good in here.

302
00:17:35.663 --> 00:17:37.621
It'’s about to
smell a whole lot worse.

303
00:17:49.851 --> 00:17:51.940
Yeah. Ray. Leave a message.

304
00:17:54.943 --> 00:17:56.249
Yo. Meatball.

305
00:17:57.424 --> 00:17:58.599
This pot'’s hot.

306
00:18:06.041 --> 00:18:07.434
So what?

307
00:18:07.608 --> 00:18:09.436
Place is supposed
to be empty.

308
00:18:10.437 --> 00:18:12.569
Shut the fuck up.
We got a job to do.

309
00:18:21.317 --> 00:18:22.710
Hand me your lighter.

310
00:18:22.884 --> 00:18:23.928
What?

311
00:18:25.365 --> 00:18:27.062
Give me your lighter.

312
00:18:27.758 --> 00:18:29.369
I don'’t got one.

313
00:18:29.543 --> 00:18:31.675
How the fuck do you smoke
and you don'’t have a lighter?

314
00:18:32.981 --> 00:18:34.025
I quit.

315
00:18:35.723 --> 00:18:37.551
Fuck. we'’re in a kitchen.
There'’s gotta be one
around here.

316
00:18:37.725 --> 00:18:39.640
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

317
00:18:47.082 --> 00:18:48.649
What?

318
00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:04.246
"Wifey."

319
00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:05.987
She'’s calling you. Ray.

320
00:20:07.336 --> 00:20:08.729
Let me talk to her.

321
00:20:09.773 --> 00:20:11.122
You think I'’m an idiot?

322
00:20:11.949 --> 00:20:13.212
Yes.

323
00:20:15.649 --> 00:20:16.998
Ray?

324
00:20:17.172 --> 00:20:20.175
Lady. you got
bad taste in men.

325
00:20:20.349 --> 00:20:21.872
Who'’s this?

326
00:20:22.046 --> 00:20:24.266
"Who is this?"
That don'’t matter.
"Who is this?"

327
00:20:25.224 --> 00:20:26.573
Where'’s Ray?

328
00:20:26.747 --> 00:20:28.183
Handsome Ray
is right here with me.

329
00:20:28.357 --> 00:20:30.316
Put him on.

330
00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:32.535
You don'’t like talking
to me. lollipop?

331
00:20:34.494 --> 00:20:36.713
Put my husband on the phone.

332
00:20:36.887 --> 00:20:38.019
Or what?

333
00:20:40.543 --> 00:20:43.329
I'’m not a person
you wanna fuck with.

334
00:20:45.374 --> 00:20:47.594
Then you'’re not gonna like
what we did to your restaurant.

335
00:20:47.768 --> 00:20:49.335
What did you do
to my restaurant?

336
00:20:49.509 --> 00:20:51.598
It'’s in flames.

337
00:20:51.772 --> 00:20:55.689
Big. bright. orange.
gorgeous flames.

338
00:20:55.863 --> 00:20:56.994
Oh. is it?

339
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:04.611
Listen to me.

340
00:21:04.785 --> 00:21:07.570
You better get
out of there right now
before we torch the place.

341
00:21:07.744 --> 00:21:10.878
or your opening night
is gonna be your last night.

342
00:21:12.009 --> 00:21:13.184
I doubt it.

343
00:21:16.231 --> 00:21:19.843
She hung up on me. Ray!

344
00:21:23.325 --> 00:21:24.413
Shit.

345
00:21:38.384 --> 00:21:39.298
Ana.

346
00:21:39.472 --> 00:21:41.212
Oh. honey.

347
00:21:42.083 --> 00:21:44.085
Thank God you'’re okay.

348
00:21:45.608 --> 00:21:46.870
Is that a gun?

349
00:21:47.044 --> 00:21:49.308
Oh. just for emergencies.
Don'’t worry.

350
00:21:50.787 --> 00:21:52.702
What-- Where did
you get a gun?

351
00:21:54.138 --> 00:21:55.357
I had it.

352
00:21:55.531 --> 00:21:57.185
Is that blood?

353
00:21:57.359 --> 00:22:00.014
Yeah. but--What the fuck is going on?

354
00:22:00.188 --> 00:22:01.798
Stay calm. Calm.Whose blood is that?

355
00:22:01.972 --> 00:22:03.452
No. don'’t-- don'’t
open the door. Ray. Don'’t--

356
00:22:05.976 --> 00:22:07.326
Oh. fuck.

357
00:22:08.979 --> 00:22:10.329
Oh. fuck.

358
00:22:11.721 --> 00:22:13.114
Dom is gonna kill me.

359
00:22:14.289 --> 00:22:15.682
Who? Who'’s Dom?

360
00:22:17.248 --> 00:22:18.337
A bad man.

361
00:22:21.731 --> 00:22:23.124
Why is he
gonna kill you?

362
00:22:27.346 --> 00:22:28.434
Ray!

363
00:22:28.608 --> 00:22:30.871
Sorry. I-I-I didn'’t know.

364
00:22:31.611 --> 00:22:33.221
You didn'’t know what?

365
00:22:35.876 --> 00:22:37.312
I thought
there would be more time.

366
00:22:37.486 --> 00:22:39.227
I didn'’t know
it was gonna be tonight.

367
00:22:39.401 --> 00:22:41.621
Ray. what did you do?

368
00:22:46.843 --> 00:22:48.105
I fucked up.

369
00:22:50.194 --> 00:22:51.848
I owe a lot of money.

370
00:22:52.022 --> 00:22:54.242
and I thought
I could pay it back.

371
00:22:54.416 --> 00:22:56.853
you know.
when the restaurant
got successful.

372
00:22:59.552 --> 00:23:01.380
How much do you owe?

373
00:23:03.251 --> 00:23:04.383
A lot.

374
00:23:05.122 --> 00:23:06.559
How much. Ray?

375
00:23:08.169 --> 00:23:09.649
1.2.

376
00:23:11.607 --> 00:23:14.088
Million?

377
00:23:15.132 --> 00:23:17.004
1.3 if you round.

378
00:23:17.178 --> 00:23:19.310
Oh. God. All right.

379
00:23:19.485 --> 00:23:20.790
Get a little deeper there.

380
00:23:20.964 --> 00:23:23.010
Yeah. Oh. shit.

381
00:23:23.184 --> 00:23:24.315
Not that deep.

382
00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:27.362
Oh. goddamn. Gary.

383
00:23:28.842 --> 00:23:32.149
Who the fuck?

384
00:23:33.412 --> 00:23:35.979
Get that. will you. Gar?Yes. sir.

385
00:23:36.632 --> 00:23:38.068
What?

386
00:23:38.242 --> 00:23:40.723
Sorry to bother you. Pops.
I know it ruins the mood.

387
00:23:40.897 --> 00:23:43.247
Get to the point.

388
00:23:43.422 --> 00:23:45.902
Well. we got a little
situation going on.

389
00:23:47.034 --> 00:23:48.731
And you can'’t handle it?

390
00:23:48.905 --> 00:23:52.996
I can. I just wanted to.
you know. make you awares.
check-in.

391
00:23:55.608 --> 00:23:58.045
This wasn'’t supposed
to be difficult. Mick.

392
00:23:58.219 --> 00:24:00.090
That'’s why I sent you
to take care of it.

393
00:24:02.049 --> 00:24:03.833
I am taking care of it.

394
00:24:04.007 --> 00:24:05.922
Oh. not that. Gary.
Not that deep.

395
00:24:06.096 --> 00:24:07.707
Son of a bitch.

396
00:24:07.881 --> 00:24:09.012
If you were taking care of it.

397
00:24:09.186 --> 00:24:10.753
we wouldn'’t be talking
right now.

398
00:24:11.624 --> 00:24:13.887
Look. Dad...

399
00:24:16.803 --> 00:24:18.848
Can you just send me
a couple more guys?

400
00:24:19.022 --> 00:24:21.329
What happened to
the guys that you had?

401
00:24:21.503 --> 00:24:24.898
Gio and the pip-squeak.
what'’s-his-name.

402
00:24:25.072 --> 00:24:27.770
You know that jerk. Ray.
he really fucked us
on this one. Dad.

403
00:24:28.684 --> 00:24:29.685
What?

404
00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.472
Oh. goddamn!Oh. sorry. Okay.

405
00:24:33.646 --> 00:24:34.951
Put him on.

406
00:24:36.039 --> 00:24:37.127
Can'’t do that.

407
00:24:38.825 --> 00:24:39.826
Why not?

408
00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:41.915
'’Cause he'’s inside.

409
00:24:42.089 --> 00:24:43.612
holed up
with that Russian lady.

410
00:24:43.786 --> 00:24:45.266
I gotta tell you.
I don'’t like her one bit.

411
00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.486
I'’m on my way. No. no. no.

412
00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:48.835
Just-- Just-- Just send--

413
00:24:49.009 --> 00:24:50.750
Jesus. man.

414
00:24:50.924 --> 00:24:52.752
Let this be
a lesson to you. Gary.

415
00:24:52.926 --> 00:24:54.493
If you ever want
something done right.

416
00:24:54.667 --> 00:24:57.147
don'’t ask your jerk-off son
to do it for you.

417
00:24:59.585 --> 00:25:01.717
I'’m still on the line.
Dad.

418
00:25:01.891 --> 00:25:04.503
Then hang the fuck up.
idiot.

419
00:25:23.391 --> 00:25:25.611
Ray. what did you do?

420
00:25:27.003 --> 00:25:28.222
They wanna burn down
the restaurant

421
00:25:28.396 --> 00:25:30.267
for the insurance money.

422
00:25:30.441 --> 00:25:32.095
And you'’re okay with that?

423
00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:35.664
No. Fuck no.
I'’m not okay--
I don'’t have a choice.

424
00:25:35.838 --> 00:25:38.101
Please tell me
it wasn'’t your idea.

425
00:25:38.275 --> 00:25:40.147
No. it wasn'’t.

426
00:25:40.321 --> 00:25:43.193
Maybe-- Maybe a little.

427
00:25:44.412 --> 00:25:45.500
But. Ana.

428
00:25:47.023 --> 00:25:49.286
I really believed
that we could
make this place work.

429
00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:51.724
It would'’ve been great."Would have been"?

430
00:25:53.377 --> 00:25:55.597
You'’re giving up already?
That'’s it?

431
00:25:58.992 --> 00:26:00.297
Sweetheart.
we don'’t have a choice.

432
00:26:00.471 --> 00:26:02.169
No. you don'’t have a choice.

433
00:26:02.343 --> 00:26:05.302
You'’re so
fucking irresponsible.

434
00:26:05.476 --> 00:26:06.826
I'’m sorry.

435
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.349
Not sorry enough.

436
00:26:10.133 --> 00:26:11.482
What if--Shut up!

437
00:26:15.312 --> 00:26:17.271
No wonder
you'’ve been divorced twice.

438
00:26:17.445 --> 00:26:18.794
Now I get it.

439
00:26:21.231 --> 00:26:23.712
That'’s a little
below the belt.
don'’t you think?

440
00:26:28.499 --> 00:26:30.153
I fucked up.

441
00:26:30.327 --> 00:26:31.590
but I love you.

442
00:26:32.373 --> 00:26:33.766
I truly love you.

443
00:26:35.289 --> 00:26:37.639
And if I could go back
and change all of this.

444
00:26:37.813 --> 00:26:39.946
I would do it
in a nanosecond.

445
00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:44.515
Well. you can'’t.
and you lied to me.

446
00:26:47.997 --> 00:26:49.259
What about you?

447
00:26:49.433 --> 00:26:50.739
What about--
What about this?

448
00:26:50.913 --> 00:26:53.002
What-- What about them?
Did you kill '’em?

449
00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:58.399
You really wanna know?

450
00:27:06.886 --> 00:27:09.584
Ana. talk to me.

451
00:27:11.542 --> 00:27:12.674
I. uh...

452
00:27:17.374 --> 00:27:19.550
I used to work for the KGB.

453
00:27:21.248 --> 00:27:23.816
Like Russian KGB?

454
00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.342
Yes.

455
00:27:32.389 --> 00:27:33.521
You'’re a spy.

456
00:27:36.002 --> 00:27:37.264
I'’m a chef.

457
00:27:42.399 --> 00:27:43.662
Wait. wait.

458
00:27:45.272 --> 00:27:48.579
I mean. that'’s not
something that
you just walk away from.

459
00:27:48.754 --> 00:27:50.886
How did you get out?I managed.

460
00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:52.148
I disappeared.

461
00:27:52.322 --> 00:27:53.759
until you fucking
put me on the map

462
00:27:53.933 --> 00:27:55.369
with that stupid announcement.

463
00:27:55.543 --> 00:27:58.546
How was I supposed to know
that you were fucking KGB?

464
00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.330
No. ex-KGB.

465
00:28:00.504 --> 00:28:01.810
All right.
so what now?

466
00:28:03.638 --> 00:28:05.161
Is the KGB
gonna come after you?

467
00:28:05.335 --> 00:28:06.380
No.

468
00:28:07.555 --> 00:28:08.599
Maybe.

469
00:28:14.475 --> 00:28:16.564
So I guess we'’re both
full of shit.

470
00:28:16.738 --> 00:28:18.392
No. except I lied
to protect you.

471
00:28:18.566 --> 00:28:20.960
No. you lied
to protect you.

472
00:28:21.134 --> 00:28:22.222
What the fuck do you know?

473
00:28:36.279 --> 00:28:38.281
Don'’t be mad. Don'’t be mad.
Don'’t be mad.

474
00:28:38.455 --> 00:28:39.979
I can fix this.

475
00:28:40.153 --> 00:28:41.632
Why am I here. then.

476
00:28:41.807 --> 00:28:44.331
when I should be getting
a fucking massage?

477
00:28:44.505 --> 00:28:46.507
I got a plan.You got a plan?

478
00:28:46.681 --> 00:28:49.336
The only plan you got is
I got a plan.

479
00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:53.906
A Russian problem calls for
a Russian solution. right?

480
00:28:59.738 --> 00:29:00.956
You had your chance. Mickey.

481
00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:04.177
Leo. Tommy. Billy. let'’s go.

482
00:29:04.351 --> 00:29:06.614
I did what I had to.
I had no choice!

483
00:29:06.788 --> 00:29:08.268
Welcome to the fucking club.

484
00:29:08.442 --> 00:29:10.096
That'’s not the same thing.

485
00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:12.185
It is exactly
the same fucking thing.

486
00:29:12.359 --> 00:29:15.188
I tried so hard to get rid
of one thing in my life.

487
00:29:15.362 --> 00:29:17.016
and here you are.
fucking it up

488
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:18.887
like you fucked up
everything else.

489
00:29:20.454 --> 00:29:21.585
I can fix this.

490
00:29:23.196 --> 00:29:24.501
Let me talk to them.

491
00:29:24.675 --> 00:29:26.547
Talk to him?
Talking will do nothing.

492
00:29:28.201 --> 00:29:29.985
You don'’t know these guys.

493
00:29:30.159 --> 00:29:32.596
They'’re not gonna
walk away from this.

494
00:29:32.771 --> 00:29:35.861
There'’s a lot of money
on the line.
and there'’s a lot of them.

495
00:29:36.687 --> 00:29:38.124
I don'’t care.

496
00:29:38.298 --> 00:29:40.517
Dom is not somebody
you wanna fuck with.

497
00:29:44.695 --> 00:29:46.567
I'’m not somebody
you wanna fuck with.

498
00:29:46.741 --> 00:29:48.351
Let me talk to them.

499
00:29:48.525 --> 00:29:51.224
He needs me alive.
He'’s not gonna kill me.

500
00:29:51.398 --> 00:29:52.834
He needs me breathing

501
00:29:53.008 --> 00:29:55.881
so he can collect on
the insurance money.

502
00:29:56.055 --> 00:29:58.579
I can reason with him.
He'’s a reasonable guy.

503
00:29:58.753 --> 00:30:00.711
He'’s a reason--
Did he just say
he'’s a reasonable guy?

504
00:30:00.886 --> 00:30:02.583
Oh. no. no.Did you just say
he'’s a reasonable guy?

505
00:30:02.757 --> 00:30:03.889
No. we'’re not going
down that road.

506
00:30:04.063 --> 00:30:05.412
No. wait. wait.
You like that word.

507
00:30:05.586 --> 00:30:06.630
We'’re not going down--You like that word.

508
00:30:06.805 --> 00:30:07.936
No. we'’re not doing--

509
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:09.808
You call me unreasonable
all the time!

510
00:30:11.461 --> 00:30:13.028
And what do I do?

511
00:30:13.202 --> 00:30:14.334
I cook.

512
00:30:15.596 --> 00:30:17.076
Sometimes I shout.

513
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:20.340
And that makes me
unreasonable?

514
00:30:20.514 --> 00:30:26.041
This guy wants to burn down
a perfectly good restaurant.
and he'’s the reasonable one.

515
00:30:27.303 --> 00:30:28.914
That'’s not what I'’m saying.

516
00:30:29.871 --> 00:30:32.178
No?No.
we'’re on the same team.

517
00:30:32.352 --> 00:30:34.180
No. we are not
on the same team.

518
00:30:35.181 --> 00:30:37.139
You want to talk to people

519
00:30:37.313 --> 00:30:39.576
that want to
burn this place down.

520
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:42.188
And what do you wanna do?
You wanna kill '’em?

521
00:30:45.234 --> 00:30:48.324
I won'’t let them
burn down my restaurant.

522
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:51.197
Our restaurant?

523
00:30:53.547 --> 00:30:54.722
I'’ll talk to them.

524
00:30:56.289 --> 00:30:57.986
It'’s the only way.

525
00:31:00.859 --> 00:31:02.861
If you'’re not gonna
be reasonable. I will.

526
00:31:06.212 --> 00:31:07.256
Dom!

527
00:31:08.692 --> 00:31:09.955
I just wanna talk.

528
00:31:25.796 --> 00:31:27.450
What'’s going on. Ray?

529
00:31:28.582 --> 00:31:30.801
You can'’t burn it down.
Not yet.

530
00:31:32.542 --> 00:31:33.587
Why is that?

531
00:31:34.893 --> 00:31:38.070
Give us a chance to
really make it work. please.

532
00:31:38.244 --> 00:31:40.115
I got a good feeling
about this place.

533
00:31:40.289 --> 00:31:41.987
And you had
a good feeling about

534
00:31:42.161 --> 00:31:44.119
the last four restaurants too.
Do you remember that?

535
00:31:44.293 --> 00:31:46.600
Yeah. I know. I know.
but this one'’s different.

536
00:31:47.514 --> 00:31:48.776
It'’s not working
for me. Ray.

537
00:31:49.951 --> 00:31:52.606
Is that all you got
is a good feeling?

538
00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:54.434
Come on.
don'’t bust my balls.

539
00:31:54.608 --> 00:31:57.480
All right. look.
I got a really
good feeling. All right?

540
00:31:57.654 --> 00:31:59.221
Is that--
Does that work?

541
00:31:59.395 --> 00:32:01.571
Doesn'’t mean much
coming from you.

542
00:32:05.184 --> 00:32:06.359
Dom. please.

543
00:32:07.403 --> 00:32:08.404
Ray...

544
00:32:09.101 --> 00:32:10.885
take solace in the fact

545
00:32:11.059 --> 00:32:14.149
that you didn'’t run this one
into the ground.

546
00:32:16.586 --> 00:32:17.805
You burned it.

547
00:32:46.747 --> 00:32:48.270
You think
they got her?

548
00:32:48.444 --> 00:32:50.707
Enough bullshit.
Mickey. you'’re up.

549
00:32:50.881 --> 00:32:52.796
Burn this place to the ground.

550
00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:55.582
Dom. please. Come on.

551
00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:41.497
Hello? Mimi?

552
00:33:41.671 --> 00:33:43.804
Ana. is that you?

553
00:33:45.588 --> 00:33:46.807
Yes.

554
00:33:48.026 --> 00:33:49.636
How are you?

555
00:33:50.376 --> 00:33:52.117
Um...

556
00:33:53.466 --> 00:33:54.728
I need your help.

557
00:33:56.469 --> 00:33:59.515
Well. this is a blast
from the past. isn'’t it?

558
00:34:00.908 --> 00:34:02.736
Same old shit.
like the old days.

559
00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:04.738
You get in some shit.
and you call me
to bail you out?

560
00:34:07.045 --> 00:34:09.221
Yes.

561
00:34:09.395 --> 00:34:10.874
Hmm.
So you need my help.

562
00:34:13.355 --> 00:34:16.663
There are some men trying
to burn down my restaurant.

563
00:34:17.490 --> 00:34:20.623
Oh. no.
On opening night?

564
00:34:21.450 --> 00:34:22.538
Yeah.

565
00:34:22.712 --> 00:34:23.539
Well. that'’s
just rude.

566
00:34:24.497 --> 00:34:25.498
How many are we talking?

567
00:34:25.672 --> 00:34:27.543
Not sure yet.

568
00:34:28.414 --> 00:34:29.806
But can you help?

569
00:34:31.982 --> 00:34:33.941
Well. what choice
do I have. Ana?

570
00:34:34.115 --> 00:34:36.900
If you'’re calling me.
I'’m guessing
it'’s an emergency. right?

571
00:34:37.988 --> 00:34:39.642
It is. yeah. Um...

572
00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:41.905
Could you hurry?

573
00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.516
I will. babe.
Don'’t worry.

574
00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:46.127
A road to a friend'’s house
is never long.

575
00:34:48.042 --> 00:34:50.784
And we are friends.
right?

576
00:34:50.958 --> 00:34:53.787
Even after
all these years?

577
00:34:54.744 --> 00:34:56.920
Yeah. friends.

578
00:34:58.096 --> 00:34:59.184
Good.

579
00:35:00.663 --> 00:35:03.101
Protect yourself. Anya.
We'’ll see you soon.

580
00:35:03.275 --> 00:35:05.973
Mimi. listen.

581
00:35:06.147 --> 00:35:07.148
Uh...

582
00:35:08.106 --> 00:35:10.064
I just want you to know I--

583
00:35:10.238 --> 00:35:12.501
You know. when I left-- No. no. no. no. no. No.

584
00:35:12.675 --> 00:35:15.330
We will chitchat all about it
when I get there. '’kay?

585
00:35:15.504 --> 00:35:16.636
Can'’t wait.

586
00:35:24.296 --> 00:35:26.036
This one'’s clean.Please stop
singing that.

587
00:35:28.561 --> 00:35:29.736
Let'’s go.

588
00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:31.346
We'’re leaving?Yes. pack your shit.

589
00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.565
Let'’s go.Okay.

590
00:35:32.739 --> 00:35:34.262
Girls. we'’re--Come on. girls.

591
00:35:34.436 --> 00:35:35.437
Who was that?

592
00:35:37.918 --> 00:35:40.312
It'’s simple. You just run in.
throw it on the ground. Boom.

593
00:35:40.486 --> 00:35:42.009
I don'’t take orders
from you.

594
00:35:42.183 --> 00:35:44.403
This comes direct
from my pops.

595
00:35:44.577 --> 00:35:46.056
He told you to do it.

596
00:35:46.231 --> 00:35:48.537
And I'’m telling you.
It'’s called delegating.

597
00:35:48.711 --> 00:35:50.539
It'’s what leadership is.

598
00:35:50.713 --> 00:35:51.758
Now go.

599
00:35:59.548 --> 00:36:00.941
Come on.
Are you scared?

600
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.379
I'’ll tell my dad
you did a good job.

601
00:36:04.553 --> 00:36:06.642
Just do this thing.
It'’s gonna be huge.

602
00:36:06.816 --> 00:36:08.949
You do it.
You'’re not gonna convince me.

603
00:36:09.123 --> 00:36:10.516
You'’re being insubordinate.

604
00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:12.561
Grow your balls and listen.

605
00:36:12.735 --> 00:36:15.260
No way.
It'’s not gonna happen.Fucking idiots.

606
00:36:18.306 --> 00:36:19.481
Here. let'’s go.

607
00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:21.875
Let'’s go.

608
00:36:22.789 --> 00:36:23.833
You got it.

609
00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.066
You can do it.

610
00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:52.862
Come on.

611
00:37:06.833 --> 00:37:07.877
Shit.

612
00:37:51.573 --> 00:37:53.749
Just saying.
if we get pulled over.
it'’s gonna slow us down.

613
00:37:53.923 --> 00:37:55.577
Okay. Thanks. Tom.Y-You'’re welcome.

614
00:38:01.061 --> 00:38:02.584
Going fast.

615
00:38:02.758 --> 00:38:04.194
Driving fast. too fast.

616
00:38:04.369 --> 00:38:05.544
I think the speed limit'’s
actually--

617
00:38:05.718 --> 00:38:06.849
Oh. my God. you'’re really--

618
00:38:07.023 --> 00:38:07.894
Tom.Yeah.

619
00:38:15.989 --> 00:38:17.730
You know what this
reminds me of?

620
00:38:21.647 --> 00:38:23.431
Bucharest?Yeah. Bucharest.

621
00:38:23.605 --> 00:38:26.304
Remember that was--
that was a--
that was a good one.

622
00:38:27.653 --> 00:38:29.959
You were good
in Bucharest.I was.

623
00:38:31.221 --> 00:38:33.441
I mean. yeah.
because we sma--

624
00:38:33.615 --> 00:38:35.791
Remember we smashed into
the dog park
and those really angry--

625
00:38:35.965 --> 00:38:37.837
It was a mission. Tom.
And was it successful?

626
00:38:38.011 --> 00:38:39.186
It was
a successful mission.It was.

627
00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:40.405
Yeah.

628
00:38:41.667 --> 00:38:42.755
This isn'’t a mission.

629
00:38:42.929 --> 00:38:44.409
Nobody likes
a back-seat driver. Tom.

630
00:38:44.583 --> 00:38:46.062
I'’m sitting in the front.

631
00:38:46.236 --> 00:38:48.064
Why did we have to come?Excuse me. lady.

632
00:38:48.238 --> 00:38:49.936
You know exactly why.

633
00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:51.720
I have homework. Mimi.

634
00:38:51.894 --> 00:38:53.809
Do not
fucking call me. Mimi.

635
00:38:53.983 --> 00:38:56.551
The last time
you had "homework."
we came home to a party.

636
00:38:56.725 --> 00:38:57.944
It was sociology.

637
00:38:58.118 --> 00:38:59.467
And it was
a get-together. so--

638
00:38:59.641 --> 00:39:00.947
Yeah. okay.
so that'’s your truth.

639
00:39:01.121 --> 00:39:02.949
Just listen to your Mimi--
Mommy-- your mother.

640
00:39:03.123 --> 00:39:05.168
Listen-- Look.
it was just a suggestion.
If you slow down--

641
00:39:05.343 --> 00:39:07.780
Okay. well. I suggest that
you mind your own business.

642
00:39:07.954 --> 00:39:09.259
Thank you
for that suggestion.

643
00:39:10.522 --> 00:39:12.698
I'’m just trying to help.Okay. you can help.

644
00:39:12.872 --> 00:39:15.875
Just do it silently
inside your mind.

645
00:39:18.834 --> 00:39:21.968
Dr. Gottlieb says that
we should have an open forum--You know what?

646
00:39:22.142 --> 00:39:24.971
If Dr. fucking Gottlieb
knows so much.

647
00:39:25.145 --> 00:39:28.104
why has she been married
three times. huh. Tom?

648
00:39:28.278 --> 00:39:30.629
Oh. my God.
just get fucking
divorced already.

649
00:39:30.803 --> 00:39:32.326
Language.

650
00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:34.284
Do you realize
how much you guys
are screwing us up?

651
00:39:34.459 --> 00:39:37.113
Okay. your mother and I
are just working
through a cloudy yesterday

652
00:39:37.287 --> 00:39:39.420
to get to
a sunny tomorrow sometime.

653
00:39:39.594 --> 00:39:41.204
Mm-hmm.
Yeah. right.

654
00:39:41.379 --> 00:39:43.555
Jesus Christ. Tom.

655
00:39:43.729 --> 00:39:47.559
She'’s really gotten to you.
You remembered that thing
hanging above her wall?

656
00:39:50.257 --> 00:39:51.171
TROMP.

657
00:39:51.345 --> 00:39:53.695
Oh. Lord.TROMP!

658
00:39:55.436 --> 00:39:57.743
Trust. respect.
open-mindedness. positivity.

659
00:39:57.917 --> 00:39:59.266
TROMP.Mm-hmm.

660
00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:00.876
If you can'’t handle all four.
just pick one.

661
00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:03.966
Okay. I will pick one.
I pick positivity.Puh!

662
00:40:05.098 --> 00:40:07.187
I'’m positive
Dr. fucking Gottlieb

663
00:40:07.361 --> 00:40:10.190
hasn'’t gotten laid
since the Berlin Wall.

664
00:40:12.932 --> 00:40:14.281
Makes three of us.

665
00:40:14.455 --> 00:40:16.501
Well. then take
some fucking initiative.

666
00:40:19.025 --> 00:40:21.419
Oh. God.

667
00:40:24.596 --> 00:40:27.816
I'’m just gonna make
an observation.
You'’re driving like a maniac.

668
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:30.340
And I think this is
a personal vendetta
against your best friend.

669
00:40:30.515 --> 00:40:32.778
Ex-best friend.
current enemy.

670
00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:36.129
And will you have
my fucking back?

671
00:40:40.568 --> 00:40:41.656
It'’s okay. girls.

672
00:40:54.669 --> 00:40:57.193
Keep it locked up.
Keep the riffraff out.

673
00:40:57.367 --> 00:40:58.717
Shouldn'’t be a long night.

674
00:40:59.369 --> 00:41:00.327
Thanks for coming out.

675
00:41:00.501 --> 00:41:02.460
No sweat.
You got it. boss.

676
00:41:06.681 --> 00:41:09.771
Six guys in.
no guys out?

677
00:41:09.945 --> 00:41:12.644
Shit. man. Man.
this is some bullshit.

678
00:41:12.818 --> 00:41:15.124
Gary. focus. please.Man. I am focused.

679
00:41:15.298 --> 00:41:16.865
That'’s how
I gather myself. okay?

680
00:41:18.301 --> 00:41:19.868
I'’m just a masseuse.

681
00:41:20.042 --> 00:41:21.566
I shouldn'’t even
be here.

682
00:41:22.958 --> 00:41:24.090
Shit!

683
00:41:25.831 --> 00:41:27.528
Don'’t be a bitch. man.
Come on.

684
00:41:31.401 --> 00:41:32.490
Come on!

685
00:41:32.664 --> 00:41:36.319
Shut up.
God. please help me.

686
00:41:36.494 --> 00:41:37.973
Gary. what are you
waiting for?
Let'’s go.

687
00:41:38.147 --> 00:41:39.932
Ah!

688
00:41:41.368 --> 00:41:43.413
Okay. come on. Go.

689
00:41:44.589 --> 00:41:46.199
It'’s not locked.
You go first. You go first.

690
00:41:46.373 --> 00:41:48.201
No. get your
Black ass in there.

691
00:41:48.375 --> 00:41:51.204
That'’s some racist shit.
You can'’t say that shit.

692
00:41:51.378 --> 00:41:53.293
My bad. My bad.
You'’re right.

693
00:42:07.176 --> 00:42:08.613
I'’ma go towards
the office. all right?

694
00:42:08.787 --> 00:42:09.831
You go right there. boy.

695
00:42:11.441 --> 00:42:12.530
You got that. right?

696
00:42:26.021 --> 00:42:26.892
Bobby!

697
00:42:27.893 --> 00:42:29.285
I'’m scared!
Open up. man!

698
00:42:29.459 --> 00:42:31.940
Okay. A little bit of Ali.
A little bit of Jackie.

699
00:42:40.906 --> 00:42:41.733
Okay.

700
00:42:43.125 --> 00:42:45.693
Let'’s do this.
I got you. okay?

701
00:42:51.873 --> 00:42:55.311
You better get her. Bobby!
Yeah! Whup her ass. boy!

00:43:16.115 --> 00:43:17.725
Bobby. is she dead?

704
00:43:23.644 --> 00:43:25.298
What the fuck--

705
00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:32.958
No. No! No!

706
00:43:35.003 --> 00:43:36.875
No! No!

707
00:43:37.049 --> 00:43:38.616
No!

708
00:43:49.061 --> 00:43:50.715
I didn'’t see that.
I didn'’t. I didn'’t.

709
00:43:50.889 --> 00:43:53.543
One more time.
Okay. that'’s just--

710
00:43:56.285 --> 00:43:57.722
Shit.

711
00:43:57.896 --> 00:43:59.071
Bobby. Bobby.
Please. come on. Bobby.

712
00:44:00.942 --> 00:44:03.858
No. stay down.
Be quiet. Be quiet. be quiet.

713
00:44:04.032 --> 00:44:06.556
Okay. look!
I'’m blind.

714
00:44:06.731 --> 00:44:08.950
I didn'’t see your face
or the dead bodies.

715
00:44:09.124 --> 00:44:11.170
Aah! I didn'’t see nothing!

716
00:44:11.344 --> 00:44:12.388
Oh. shit! Please!

717
00:44:15.696 --> 00:44:17.567
Please!

718
00:44:17.742 --> 00:44:19.482
You got 90 seconds
before the oil

719
00:44:19.657 --> 00:44:21.441
turns your fingers
into pommes frites.

720
00:44:21.615 --> 00:44:24.792
Come on. Oh. shit.
Look. lady. I only understand
American threats.

721
00:44:24.966 --> 00:44:26.664
It means french fries!

722
00:44:26.838 --> 00:44:28.796
Okay. look.

723
00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:32.191
Okay. look. my name is Gary.
and I'’m a Libra
and I like Chinese food.

724
00:44:32.365 --> 00:44:34.541
Who cares about
your fucking star sign?

725
00:44:34.715 --> 00:44:36.674
And I don'’t have no problems
with you at all.

726
00:44:36.848 --> 00:44:38.327
I have no problem
with you. Gary.

727
00:44:38.501 --> 00:44:40.939
I just have questions
and I want answers.

728
00:44:41.113 --> 00:44:42.418
Okay. look--

729
00:44:42.592 --> 00:44:45.117
Tell me about Dom!Well. shit.

730
00:44:45.291 --> 00:44:48.337
I think Dom. he'’s an Aquarius.
His birthday was two days ago.

731
00:44:48.511 --> 00:44:50.470
No! That'’s not
what I wanna know.Okay.

732
00:44:50.644 --> 00:44:53.212
Why does he wanna
burn down my restaurant?

733
00:44:53.386 --> 00:44:55.431
I don'’t know why!
I really don'’t know!

734
00:44:55.605 --> 00:44:56.868
Well.
you better fucking know

735
00:44:57.042 --> 00:44:58.957
because you'’ve got
60 seconds left.

736
00:44:59.131 --> 00:45:00.567
Okay. okay.
It'’s an insurance thing.

737
00:45:00.741 --> 00:45:02.700
It'’s very confusing. okay?
It'’s confusing.

738
00:45:02.874 --> 00:45:05.485
Why tonight?
Why tonight?I don'’t know!

739
00:45:05.659 --> 00:45:07.574
Because they got--
It'’s a war
between the families.

740
00:45:07.748 --> 00:45:10.533
And he gotta have--
He says gotta have cash
for the company.

741
00:45:10.708 --> 00:45:11.970
How many men
work for him?

742
00:45:12.144 --> 00:45:13.972
I don'’t know. I don'’t know.

743
00:45:14.146 --> 00:45:17.279
This is getting hot.
It'’s getting hot. please.

744
00:45:17.453 --> 00:45:19.412
That'’s the idea.

745
00:45:19.586 --> 00:45:22.067
Please. lady. look.
I'’m a masseuse!

746
00:45:22.241 --> 00:45:23.938
All I do is massage!What?

747
00:45:24.112 --> 00:45:26.027
Yes!
I need my hands!

748
00:45:26.201 --> 00:45:28.334
Please. let me go. Please.

749
00:45:28.508 --> 00:45:30.205
Oh.

750
00:45:32.251 --> 00:45:33.774
Okay. Okay.

751
00:45:33.948 --> 00:45:36.821
Please. please. please.
Look. Okay.

752
00:45:36.995 --> 00:45:38.866
Okay. I just wanna say
thank you. first of all.

753
00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:40.825
for respecting
an artist'’s hands.

754
00:45:40.999 --> 00:45:42.609
You gonna kill me?

755
00:45:42.783 --> 00:45:44.567
Huh?

756
00:45:44.742 --> 00:45:46.352
I don'’t enjoy this.

757
00:45:47.962 --> 00:45:49.224
So you not
gonna kill me?

758
00:45:52.053 --> 00:45:53.359
Hell.
you could let me go.

759
00:45:57.929 --> 00:45:59.278
So you'’re a masseuse.

760
00:45:59.452 --> 00:46:01.584
Yes. I'’m--
I'’m a certified masseuse.

761
00:46:01.759 --> 00:46:03.499
I-- I do massages all day.

762
00:46:03.673 --> 00:46:06.285
and I can tell
you need a massage
right now.

763
00:46:06.459 --> 00:46:08.504
I can put my hands on you
and put '’em--

764
00:46:08.678 --> 00:46:09.854
You'’re Gary. huh?

765
00:46:10.028 --> 00:46:12.334
Yes. I am Gary.You a Libra?

766
00:46:12.508 --> 00:46:14.336
Yes. I am a Libra.

767
00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:17.035
If you don'’t like that.
I can change my sign
if you want to.

768
00:46:20.690 --> 00:46:21.996
What that mean?
What that mean?

769
00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:23.911
That mean you about to--
Some people coming in?

770
00:46:24.085 --> 00:46:26.827
It means get out of here. Gary.
before I change my mind.

771
00:46:27.959 --> 00:46:29.221
I understand that.

772
00:46:29.395 --> 00:46:31.832
But can I use
your restroom first. huh?

773
00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:35.053
Okay. I'’m out.
I don'’t like that look.

774
00:46:35.227 --> 00:46:36.619
Get the fuck out!Okay.

775
00:46:37.533 --> 00:46:39.013
Shit.

776
00:46:55.682 --> 00:46:57.727
We had some calls
about some gunfire
in the area.

777
00:46:57.902 --> 00:46:59.468
You know anything
about that?

778
00:46:59.642 --> 00:47:02.907
Uh. we'’re digging up
the gas main
at the restaurant.

779
00:47:03.081 --> 00:47:05.605
Jackhammer is gonna be
going on and off all night.

780
00:47:06.736 --> 00:47:08.260
Yeah.

781
00:47:08.434 --> 00:47:11.829
It'’s a residential area.
Got a lot of busybodies.

782
00:47:12.655 --> 00:47:13.831
I'’ll leave you to it.

783
00:47:34.242 --> 00:47:35.504
Ready?Ready.

784
00:47:36.723 --> 00:47:38.986
Seriously.
why do we have to be here?

785
00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:41.119
Because we don'’t trust you.

786
00:47:46.037 --> 00:47:47.952
Hey. hey. hey.
Ease up there.

787
00:47:50.215 --> 00:47:51.738
Hello. ma'’am?

788
00:47:51.912 --> 00:47:55.220
Hello! Just passing through.

789
00:47:55.394 --> 00:47:57.309
I'’m sorry. ma'’am.
this road is closed.

790
00:47:57.483 --> 00:47:59.180
Closed? I--

791
00:47:59.354 --> 00:48:02.140
No. I'’m meeting a friend
at a restaurant
down the street.

792
00:48:02.314 --> 00:48:03.881
It'’s pretty late.

793
00:48:04.055 --> 00:48:05.578
I'’m pretty sure the restaurant'’s
not still open.

794
00:48:05.752 --> 00:48:07.928
No. no. no. I'’m sure
she'’s there waiting for me.

795
00:48:08.102 --> 00:48:10.888
I'’m sorry. ma'’am. no can do.
It'’s just not safe.

796
00:48:11.062 --> 00:48:12.063
You'’re gonna have
to call your friend.

797
00:48:12.237 --> 00:48:14.326
Oh. dear.You can loop back aro--

798
00:48:15.893 --> 00:48:17.111
Oh.

799
00:48:18.286 --> 00:48:20.593
Fun.Warn me next time.

800
00:48:20.767 --> 00:48:22.421
Oh. God.

801
00:48:36.609 --> 00:48:37.958
I understand.Pop!

802
00:48:39.394 --> 00:48:41.788
I said I understand that.

803
00:48:41.962 --> 00:48:43.790
I know it'’s short notice.Pop!

804
00:48:43.964 --> 00:48:46.010
But this
is a really big deal.

805
00:48:46.184 --> 00:48:48.664
and it'’s
gotta go down tonight.Pops!

806
00:48:49.448 --> 00:48:52.320
Alls I want is a quote.

807
00:48:53.017 --> 00:48:54.453
Three guys--

808
00:48:54.627 --> 00:48:55.933
No. make it four guys...

809
00:48:56.107 --> 00:48:57.760
Pops....for three hours.

810
00:49:00.111 --> 00:49:01.982
Can-- Can you gimme
one second. please?

811
00:49:03.331 --> 00:49:04.550
What?

812
00:49:08.423 --> 00:49:10.643
The guys
that just went in...

813
00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:13.776
they'’re gone too.

814
00:49:20.261 --> 00:49:22.220
She got Gary.

815
00:49:25.223 --> 00:49:26.572
She got Gary.

816
00:49:30.619 --> 00:49:31.794
Scratch that.

817
00:49:32.665 --> 00:49:34.710
I need 15 more.

818
00:49:34.884 --> 00:49:37.800
I don'’t care about the cost.
Just make it happen.

819
00:49:48.855 --> 00:49:50.857
Some time tonight
would be nice.

820
00:49:51.031 --> 00:49:53.816
I may work slowly.
but I always finish quickly.

821
00:49:54.904 --> 00:49:57.211
Oh. I know
you finish quickly. Tom.

822
00:49:59.039 --> 00:50:01.215
I won'’t let your stress
disrupt my peace.

823
00:50:01.389 --> 00:50:02.738
How long is this gonna take?

824
00:50:03.913 --> 00:50:05.089
I acknowledge
your impatience.

825
00:50:05.263 --> 00:50:06.916
but I don'’t have
an answer for that.

826
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:21.888
So you'’re really
gonna do this.
You'’re gonna kill her.

827
00:50:27.415 --> 00:50:29.461
I don'’t know.
I don'’t know.

828
00:50:31.332 --> 00:50:32.942
You wanna talk about it?I don'’t wanna talk about it.

829
00:50:33.117 --> 00:50:35.380
You don'’t wanna
talk about it.
Okay. no. I understand.

830
00:50:41.647 --> 00:50:43.649
I'’m really conflicted about it.You seem conflicted.

831
00:50:43.823 --> 00:50:45.390
I am. I'’m conflicted.

832
00:50:49.046 --> 00:50:50.525
You know what this
reminds me of?

833
00:50:50.699 --> 00:50:52.049
Jakarta.

834
00:50:52.223 --> 00:50:54.921
Jakarta?
Jakarta was a shitfest.

835
00:50:56.401 --> 00:50:57.750
Oh.
it wasn'’t all bad.

836
00:51:03.625 --> 00:51:04.974
Okay. but you
feel conflicted now.

837
00:51:05.149 --> 00:51:07.803
Yes. she'’s...
my friend.

838
00:51:07.977 --> 00:51:09.457
She'’s your best friend.She was my friend.

839
00:51:09.631 --> 00:51:11.068
And then she completely
ditched me and abandoned me

840
00:51:11.242 --> 00:51:12.765
to become
a fucking civilian.

841
00:51:12.939 --> 00:51:14.723
I know. I was like...

842
00:51:14.897 --> 00:51:17.857
Must'’ve had
a pretty good reason for that.
I guess. you know.

843
00:51:18.031 --> 00:51:20.555
Whose side are you on. Tom?You know the answer.

844
00:51:20.729 --> 00:51:22.296
Do I?I hope that you do.

845
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:25.343
I hope you do.Okay.

846
00:51:25.517 --> 00:51:28.476
I hope that you realize
that this feels like
more of a conversation

847
00:51:28.650 --> 00:51:30.174
than a conflict.Conflict.

848
00:51:30.348 --> 00:51:31.479
Another fucking Gottlieb gem.It'’s a good Gottlieb.

849
00:51:31.653 --> 00:51:33.220
Thanks for that.
I'’m gonna kill her.

850
00:51:33.394 --> 00:51:34.656
I don'’t think you'’re
in the right mindset for this.

851
00:51:34.830 --> 00:51:36.136
I don'’t think killing
should be personal.

852
00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:37.877
It'’s like plumbing.
It'’s just a job.

853
00:51:38.051 --> 00:51:40.445
Okay. well then.
shut up and do your job.
All right. Tom?

854
00:51:42.534 --> 00:51:44.188
Seriously. how long
is this gonna take?

855
00:51:44.362 --> 00:51:45.928
It'’s gonna take
what it'’s gonna take!

856
00:51:46.103 --> 00:51:48.017
Calm down.Calm down. Tom!

857
00:51:48.192 --> 00:51:49.193
Okay.

858
00:51:49.932 --> 00:51:51.108
Are you done?

859
00:51:52.196 --> 00:51:53.675
Uh. hon?

860
00:52:02.336 --> 00:52:03.294
Girls!

861
00:52:05.513 --> 00:52:07.254
God. I hate them.

862
00:52:18.961 --> 00:52:20.833
Oh. shit. Hell no.

863
00:52:25.403 --> 00:52:26.882
Oh. shit!

864
00:52:34.499 --> 00:52:35.761
Hello.

865
00:52:39.286 --> 00:52:40.679
Are you okay?

866
00:52:44.813 --> 00:52:46.293
Can we help you?

867
00:52:48.774 --> 00:52:50.384
Where are you going?

868
00:52:54.606 --> 00:52:56.085
What'’s up. dog?

869
00:53:00.438 --> 00:53:02.266
How'’s it going. Dom?

870
00:53:06.226 --> 00:53:08.794
This is your last chance.
Ray.

871
00:53:08.968 --> 00:53:13.190
You need to go in there
and talk some sense
into that wife of yours.

872
00:53:14.452 --> 00:53:16.280
Think she'’s gonna
listen to me?

873
00:53:17.498 --> 00:53:19.196
You better pray
that she does.

874
00:53:53.882 --> 00:53:56.624
Not exactly the warm
and fuzzy greeting
I was hoping for.

875
00:53:57.451 --> 00:53:58.757
I could have shot you.

876
00:53:59.671 --> 00:54:01.194
What do you want.
Ray?

877
00:54:02.282 --> 00:54:03.370
Dom sent me.

878
00:54:05.894 --> 00:54:07.983
Maybe I should have
shot you.

879
00:54:11.509 --> 00:54:13.250
He wants me to get you
out of here.

880
00:54:14.425 --> 00:54:15.904
Yeah.
I'’m sure he does.

881
00:54:17.428 --> 00:54:18.820
What do you want?

882
00:54:21.127 --> 00:54:24.261
Oh. now you wanna know?

883
00:54:25.305 --> 00:54:26.611
We can take them.

884
00:54:28.003 --> 00:54:30.615
We? We.

885
00:54:32.051 --> 00:54:34.836
You just tell me what you
want me to do. and I'’ll do it.

886
00:54:35.010 --> 00:54:36.098
Fine.

887
00:54:38.362 --> 00:54:39.928
Get out of here.

888
00:54:41.582 --> 00:54:43.018
Ah...

889
00:54:43.192 --> 00:54:44.542
I'’m not leaving.

890
00:54:45.978 --> 00:54:48.676
Ray. please go.

891
00:54:53.028 --> 00:54:56.075
Sixty-five percent.What?

892
00:54:56.249 --> 00:55:00.035
Sixty-five percent
of restaurant staff
quit during their shift.

893
00:55:03.648 --> 00:55:05.606
I'’m not gonna
be one of '’em.

894
00:55:18.315 --> 00:55:20.491
Did they hurt you
out there?

895
00:55:23.755 --> 00:55:26.323
Nothing a stiff drink
won'’t fix.

896
00:55:29.151 --> 00:55:30.675
How about you?

897
00:55:31.893 --> 00:55:34.722
Well. you should see
the other guys.

898
00:55:36.724 --> 00:55:38.247
KGB. huh?

899
00:55:39.379 --> 00:55:40.337
Ex-KGB.

900
00:55:40.511 --> 00:55:42.077
What the fuck?

901
00:55:42.991 --> 00:55:45.167
How the fuck
did we even get here?

902
00:55:45.342 --> 00:55:47.039
A Russki cooking French food.

903
00:55:47.213 --> 00:55:49.346
It'’s crazy.
Doesn'’t make any sense.

904
00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:52.305
I told you.
After I left Russia.
I went to France.

905
00:55:52.479 --> 00:55:53.785
That part is true.

906
00:55:54.742 --> 00:55:56.222
What part isn'’t?

907
00:55:58.746 --> 00:55:59.965
The rest of it.

908
00:56:02.663 --> 00:56:04.839
I'’m still
the same person.

909
00:56:07.146 --> 00:56:10.541
I had no idea
they were gonna try
and torch this place

910
00:56:10.715 --> 00:56:12.369
with you in it.

911
00:56:12.543 --> 00:56:14.022
Doesn'’t matter now.

912
00:56:15.241 --> 00:56:16.895
It matters to me.

913
00:56:21.856 --> 00:56:23.423
So what'’s the plan.
baby?

914
00:56:23.597 --> 00:56:24.816
Well...

915
00:56:26.818 --> 00:56:29.081
I'’ve got
a couple of ideas.

916
00:56:31.039 --> 00:56:32.476
I bet you do.

917
00:56:34.086 --> 00:56:36.915
No! Okay. just wait! Please!

918
00:56:37.089 --> 00:56:38.569
Okay. Okay. look.

919
00:56:38.743 --> 00:56:39.831
I asked God this morning.

920
00:56:40.005 --> 00:56:41.615
I said.
"Send me two strong women."

921
00:56:41.789 --> 00:56:43.487
I don'’t give a fuck
what you asked God
about. Gary.

922
00:56:43.661 --> 00:56:46.968
How did she seem. Gary?I don'’t know!
I don'’t know!

923
00:56:47.142 --> 00:56:48.579
I think you do know.
Gary.Okay.

924
00:56:48.753 --> 00:56:51.625
Okay. she seemed sad.
I don'’t know. Sad.

925
00:56:51.799 --> 00:56:53.366
Honestly. sad.

926
00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:56.717
Sad Anya. Wonderful.
And was she alone?

927
00:56:56.891 --> 00:56:58.676
Well. sh--
Yeah. she was alone.

928
00:56:58.850 --> 00:57:01.505
She whupped all them
grown men ass by herself.

929
00:57:01.679 --> 00:57:03.463
It was embarrassing.Oh.
so she'’s still sharp?

930
00:57:03.637 --> 00:57:05.204
She'’s sharper
than a crackhead'’s toenail.

931
00:57:05.378 --> 00:57:07.032
Honey. cut the guy
some slack.

932
00:57:07.206 --> 00:57:08.903
I wouldn'’t exactly
be a torturer
if I cut him slack.

933
00:57:09.077 --> 00:57:10.514
Listen to him.

934
00:57:10.688 --> 00:57:11.776
You pussy.

935
00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:14.126
Mimi really needs
to get laid.

936
00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:15.475
Okay. okay!

937
00:57:15.649 --> 00:57:17.521
How do you get in?The back door.

938
00:57:17.695 --> 00:57:19.697
What other way
is there to get in?The front door.

939
00:57:19.871 --> 00:57:21.742
Oh. wow. you must be
a fucking architect. Gary.

940
00:57:21.916 --> 00:57:24.702
Not at all. I'’m a masseuse.
I do nothing but massages.

941
00:57:24.876 --> 00:57:26.225
You'’re a masseuse.
Do you fascial work?

942
00:57:26.399 --> 00:57:28.706
Your neck is fine. Tom!
Man up!

943
00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:31.535
I got shrapnel
between my C3 and C4.
I'’m in a lot of pain every day.

944
00:57:31.709 --> 00:57:33.232
Why are there so many cars
parked down there?

945
00:57:33.406 --> 00:57:35.277
I don'’t know!
I don'’t know. lady!

946
00:57:35.452 --> 00:57:37.758
Well. tell me
what you do know. Gary!Bitch. I don'’t know shit!

947
00:57:37.932 --> 00:57:40.282
Okay. I am so sorry
for calling you that.

948
00:57:40.457 --> 00:57:43.547
I-I just don'’t wanna die.I don'’t think
he'’s lying.

949
00:57:43.721 --> 00:57:46.288
I'’m not. I'’m not at all.

950
00:57:49.944 --> 00:57:51.250
Useless.

951
00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:57.256
You'’ll-- She'’s--
Wait. useless?

952
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:59.998
H-Him or me?
Him-- Him or me?

953
00:58:00.868 --> 00:58:03.610
White people. they so mean.

954
00:58:11.749 --> 00:58:13.141
Yeah. Ray.

955
00:58:13.315 --> 00:58:14.752
Time'’s up. Ray.

956
00:58:16.188 --> 00:58:17.319
All right then.

957
00:58:17.494 --> 00:58:19.234
Then come on out.

958
00:58:19.408 --> 00:58:22.542
Mmm.
That'’s not gonna happen.

959
00:58:22.716 --> 00:58:24.588
Jesus Christ.

960
00:58:24.762 --> 00:58:27.025
Do you got a death wish
or something?

961
00:58:27.199 --> 00:58:29.288
Yeah. something like that. Something like that.

962
00:58:29.462 --> 00:58:33.814
I'’m telling you right now.
this is your last chance.

963
00:58:33.988 --> 00:58:38.384
If you come out right now.
well. you both go free.

964
00:58:38.558 --> 00:58:43.345
But if you keep making me wait.
I'’m gonna put a bullet
in both your heads.

965
00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:45.478
Fucking idiot.

966
00:58:45.652 --> 00:58:48.525
If you kill us.
you won'’t be able to collect
on the insurance money.

967
00:58:50.048 --> 00:58:52.441
Be a shame if you did
all this for nothing.

968
00:58:52.616 --> 00:58:55.140
It'’s not nothing. asshole.

969
00:58:55.314 --> 00:58:56.750
Oh. it'’s something.

970
00:58:56.924 --> 00:58:59.013
What the fuck'’s
wrong with you?

971
00:58:59.927 --> 00:59:01.929
You fucking idiot.

972
00:59:04.453 --> 00:59:06.194
We'’re not coming out. Dom.

973
00:59:07.065 --> 00:59:08.980
If we'’re going down.

974
00:59:09.154 --> 00:59:11.112
we'’re going down swinging.

975
00:59:15.464 --> 00:59:16.814
Then we'’re coming in.

976
00:59:32.046 --> 00:59:33.961
Watch this shit.

977
00:59:34.135 --> 00:59:36.877
They'’re gonna try to
fuck me without even
buying me dinner first.

978
00:59:40.228 --> 00:59:43.971
Let'’s move.

979
00:59:44.145 --> 00:59:45.233
You Dom?

980
00:59:46.844 --> 00:59:47.845
I am.

981
00:59:48.019 --> 00:59:50.151
Good. We'’re here.

982
00:59:50.761 --> 00:59:52.110
I can see that.

983
00:59:52.284 --> 00:59:53.459
No shit.

984
00:59:53.633 --> 00:59:55.069
You spoke to Terry?

985
00:59:55.243 --> 00:59:58.595
I spoke to Terry.We spoke to Terry.

986
00:59:58.769 --> 01:00:00.597
And he explained
the overtime rules?

987
01:00:01.859 --> 01:00:05.253
Yes. Several times. Yes.

988
01:00:05.427 --> 01:00:07.952
My guys are coming straight
from another job.

989
01:00:08.126 --> 01:00:09.997
And I appreciate that.

990
01:00:10.824 --> 01:00:13.348
It means double time.

991
01:00:15.437 --> 01:00:16.787
So I'’ve heard.

992
01:00:18.136 --> 01:00:21.748
And if we go
over four hours.
we'’re gonna need lunch.

993
01:00:27.972 --> 01:00:29.016
Catered.

994
01:00:34.369 --> 01:00:35.719
Yeah. you got it.

995
01:00:35.893 --> 01:00:37.851
I want you to kill
that Russian bitch.

996
01:00:40.724 --> 01:00:43.901
Gary. Gary. Gary.
Gary. Gary.

997
01:00:44.075 --> 01:00:45.990
Gary. you'’re magic.
You'’re magic.

998
01:00:46.164 --> 01:00:48.906
No. no. no. no. no.
You don'’t understand.

999
01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:52.474
Oh. Gary.

1000
01:00:52.649 --> 01:00:54.738
Oh. Gary.

1001
01:00:54.912 --> 01:00:57.262
You'’re magic. Magic.

1002
01:00:57.436 --> 01:00:58.611
Magic hands.

1003
01:00:58.785 --> 01:01:01.135
Thank you. sir.
That means a lot. Tom.

1004
01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:02.310
I needed this.

1005
01:01:03.268 --> 01:01:05.531
I needed this and I--
and I knew--

1006
01:01:05.705 --> 01:01:08.403
When I saw
those long phalanges. I knew.

1007
01:01:08.577 --> 01:01:09.753
I knew.

1008
01:01:09.927 --> 01:01:12.669
Well.
you seem real stressed.

1009
01:01:15.759 --> 01:01:17.064
Yeah.

1010
01:01:18.587 --> 01:01:19.676
Yeah.

1011
01:01:33.428 --> 01:01:35.474
I used to be happy. Gary.

1012
01:01:41.959 --> 01:01:43.656
Me and Mimi were happy.

1013
01:01:45.571 --> 01:01:46.659
And we...

1014
01:01:50.924 --> 01:01:52.230
we had each other'’s backs.

1015
01:01:52.404 --> 01:01:55.450
She was like. "Thanks. hon.
I got you. babe.

1016
01:02:01.108 --> 01:02:02.327
I got you. babe."

1017
01:02:07.898 --> 01:02:09.682
And then we had kids.

1018
01:02:10.988 --> 01:02:11.989
Hello?

1019
01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:14.513
We can hear you.

1020
01:02:19.126 --> 01:02:20.127
Yeah.

1021
01:02:21.389 --> 01:02:24.392
Me and my ex
had a cat named Blue.

1022
01:02:26.307 --> 01:02:28.614
So I can relate with you.

1023
01:02:32.226 --> 01:02:34.141
I guess it doesn'’t help
that we work together.

1024
01:02:36.796 --> 01:02:38.711
What kind of work
do you do. Tom?

1025
01:02:40.626 --> 01:02:45.022
Well. Gary. I could tell you.
but I might have to kill you.

1026
01:02:53.117 --> 01:02:54.727
I don'’t wanna kill you.
Gary.

1027
01:02:54.901 --> 01:02:57.251
Yeah.
we don'’t want that at all.

1028
01:03:00.254 --> 01:03:02.256
I'’m not gonna kill you.
Gary.

1029
01:03:11.657 --> 01:03:12.745
Thanks. Gary.

1030
01:03:14.703 --> 01:03:16.183
You'’re free to go.

1031
01:03:18.707 --> 01:03:19.839
You sure?

1032
01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:22.929
Don'’t wanna wait on Mimi?

1033
01:03:25.366 --> 01:03:26.803
No. I'’m making the call.

1034
01:03:27.847 --> 01:03:29.066
Goodbye. Gary.

1035
01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:41.121
I love you girls.

1036
01:03:42.079 --> 01:03:43.994
Tom must be
off his meds again.

1037
01:03:44.168 --> 01:03:45.691
There'’s only two ways in.

1038
01:03:45.865 --> 01:03:48.912
For everyone who'’s gone in.
no one'’s come out.

1039
01:03:49.086 --> 01:03:51.088
Rocco didn'’t
technically go in.

1040
01:03:51.262 --> 01:03:54.265
Yeah. he exploded
in the parking lot.
Thanks. Mick.

1041
01:03:56.702 --> 01:03:59.618
How many are there?Just one.

1042
01:03:59.792 --> 01:04:00.837
Just one?

1043
01:04:01.925 --> 01:04:04.536
One giant
pain in the ass.

1044
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:07.104
Well. we'’ll hit him
from both sides.

1045
01:04:07.278 --> 01:04:08.583
Her.

1046
01:04:08.757 --> 01:04:11.412
It'’s a her?It'’s a her.

1047
01:04:11.586 --> 01:04:14.241
Huh.
Well. that'’s gonna cost extra.

1048
01:04:16.243 --> 01:04:18.637
You'’re kidding.
right?I'’m not.

1049
01:04:18.811 --> 01:04:21.074
I mean. I thought
you women wanted equality.

1050
01:04:21.248 --> 01:04:23.990
You'’re telling me
we all showed up
for one woman?

1051
01:04:24.164 --> 01:04:26.297
I'’m telling you
I got 10.000 bucks

1052
01:04:26.471 --> 01:04:28.560
for the person who kills
that goddamn Russian.

1053
01:04:28.734 --> 01:04:29.909
We'’re dealing with Russians?

1054
01:04:30.083 --> 01:04:33.086
Technically. Russian.
Just the one. Ana.

1055
01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:35.045
Is that gonna
cost us more?

1056
01:04:35.219 --> 01:04:37.047
Everything costs.

1057
01:04:38.396 --> 01:04:40.311
We'’ve dealt
with Russians before.

1058
01:04:40.485 --> 01:04:42.617
and it'’s not gonna be pretty.

1059
01:04:42.791 --> 01:04:45.142
I don'’t need it
to be pretty.
I need it to be done.

1060
01:04:45.316 --> 01:04:47.535
I'’m gonna need
one of those walkie-talkies...

1061
01:04:50.364 --> 01:04:52.279
for communication purposes.

1062
01:04:52.453 --> 01:04:55.021
Mick.
go wait in the car.

1063
01:04:55.195 --> 01:04:57.110
Adults are talking
over here.

1064
01:04:59.678 --> 01:05:02.072
Go wait
in the fucking car.

1065
01:05:04.726 --> 01:05:05.902
It'’s my kid.

1066
01:05:07.686 --> 01:05:09.601
I'’ll do him
for free.

1067
01:05:12.386 --> 01:05:13.605
Ready?

1068
01:05:15.563 --> 01:05:16.738
Ready.

1069
01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:18.305
Na zdorovie.

1070
01:05:19.089 --> 01:05:20.612
Exactly.

1071
01:06:49.179 --> 01:06:51.746
We need backup!
Send in everyone!

1072
01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:54.923
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa!

1073
01:06:56.577 --> 01:06:57.448
Get down!

1074
01:07:02.714 --> 01:07:04.368
Get her!

1075
01:07:09.373 --> 01:07:10.939
Table for five?

1076
01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:14.334
No walk-ins.

1077
01:07:19.644 --> 01:07:23.300
Ray. get behind the bar.

1078
01:07:47.454 --> 01:07:49.543
Go. go. go!

1079
01:07:56.507 --> 01:07:57.725
Scatter. scatter!

1080
01:08:10.738 --> 01:08:11.783
You okay?

1081
01:08:15.874 --> 01:08:17.354
I'’m good.

1082
01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:20.139
Hang in there.

1083
01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:24.752
Go. go.

1084
01:08:33.718 --> 01:08:35.676
She'’s out of bullets!
Push up!

1085
01:08:35.850 --> 01:08:37.461
She'’s out of ammo!

1086
01:08:39.941 --> 01:08:41.204
Watch your back!

1087
01:08:44.076 --> 01:08:45.121
Go. go. go!

1088
01:08:45.295 --> 01:08:46.818
I love you.

1089
01:08:50.952 --> 01:08:52.519
I love you. shithead.

1090
01:08:58.090 --> 01:08:59.004
Watch out!

1091
01:09:04.357 --> 01:09:06.272
There'’s another one!

1092
01:09:06.446 --> 01:09:07.708
Where the hell is--

1093
01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:13.497
What Chardonnays do you have?

1094
01:09:13.671 --> 01:09:16.369
I like something
a little fruity.

1095
01:09:16.543 --> 01:09:17.805
Trust me.

1096
01:09:23.202 --> 01:09:24.725
Whoo!

1097
01:09:24.899 --> 01:09:26.379
I mean. it can be pinot.

1098
01:09:26.553 --> 01:09:28.860
I really don'’t care what it is.
I'’m not picky.

1099
01:09:32.168 --> 01:09:35.997
Mimi. you made it.

1100
01:09:36.172 --> 01:09:37.564
Looks like
I was just in time.

1101
01:09:43.570 --> 01:09:45.224
Thanks. hon!

1102
01:09:47.444 --> 01:09:48.488
I got you. babe.

1103
01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:52.275
I missed you.
Anya.

1104
01:09:52.449 --> 01:09:55.843
Oh. I missed you too.
It'’s been so long.

1105
01:09:56.017 --> 01:09:58.150
Oh. I know. Too long.

1106
01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:00.718
Thanks for coming.

1107
01:10:00.892 --> 01:10:03.764
Me. miss an opportunity
to catch up with an old friend?

1108
01:10:03.938 --> 01:10:05.462
I would never.

1109
01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:09.988
I'’ve been looking for you
all these years.

1110
01:10:10.641 --> 01:10:12.512
Really?

1111
01:10:12.686 --> 01:10:16.168
I mean. that'’s what you do
when a friend just up
and vanishes.

1112
01:10:16.342 --> 01:10:19.780
You literally disappeared
without a trace.

1113
01:10:19.954 --> 01:10:21.478
I remember. Yeah. I know.

1114
01:10:21.652 --> 01:10:25.830
I think you owe me
a bit of an explanation.

1115
01:10:27.832 --> 01:10:31.270
Oh. come on. Mimi.
It'’s been such
a long time ago. I--

1116
01:10:34.273 --> 01:10:36.014
I don'’t think you understand

1117
01:10:36.188 --> 01:10:40.410
quite how upset
some of our friends were
when you left.

1118
01:10:43.717 --> 01:10:45.241
I'’m sorry.

1119
01:10:48.853 --> 01:10:50.028
You'’re sorry?

1120
01:10:51.682 --> 01:10:53.074
I'’m sorry.

1121
01:10:54.859 --> 01:10:57.383
Okay. well. then water
under the bridge. right?

1122
01:10:57.557 --> 01:10:59.777
Sure. I mean--Wrong.

1123
01:11:04.564 --> 01:11:07.088
Mimi. come on.Anya.

1124
01:11:10.962 --> 01:11:12.355
All right.

1125
01:11:12.529 --> 01:11:15.271
Okay. so now what?

1126
01:11:18.056 --> 01:11:20.058
Well. now I kill you.
sweetie.

1127
01:11:31.417 --> 01:11:33.506
They blamed me for leaving!

1128
01:11:35.639 --> 01:11:37.467
You'’re rusty.

1129
01:11:41.601 --> 01:11:43.995
You think I didn'’t think
about leaving. huh?

1130
01:11:44.169 --> 01:11:46.345
You could have told me!

1131
01:11:48.304 --> 01:11:50.480
Mimi. I tried to protect you.

1132
01:11:57.356 --> 01:11:59.315
But I never would'’ve left
without you.

1133
01:12:04.058 --> 01:12:06.409
Oh. I'’ve waited
years for this.

1134
01:12:15.766 --> 01:12:18.334
I made a mistake. Mimi.
I'’m sorry.

1135
01:12:18.508 --> 01:12:21.075
Aw. Not sorry enough. baby.

1136
01:12:32.217 --> 01:12:34.175
I never meant to hurt you.

1137
01:12:51.410 --> 01:12:54.108
Friends don'’t
abandon each other.

1138
01:13:12.779 --> 01:13:14.999
You left me
without cover in Paris.

1139
01:13:15.173 --> 01:13:16.435
You had Tom.

1140
01:13:16.609 --> 01:13:18.132
Tom'’s a moron!

1141
01:13:38.892 --> 01:13:41.242
At least your husband
didn'’t gamble away
your dreams.

1142
01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:43.157
What are you talking about?

1143
01:13:44.332 --> 01:13:46.683
Husbands are more trouble
than they'’re worth.

1144
01:13:46.857 --> 01:13:48.815
Yeah. tell me about it.

1145
01:13:52.384 --> 01:13:55.213
I made a mistake. Mimi.

1146
01:13:55.953 --> 01:13:58.695
Yeah. you really did.

1147
01:14:01.262 --> 01:14:03.395
You were my family.

1148
01:14:10.663 --> 01:14:13.057
And you'’re still
my fucking family.

1149
01:14:21.544 --> 01:14:24.024
I don'’t believe we'’ve been
properly introduced.

1150
01:14:30.683 --> 01:14:34.252
Oh. he'’s tougher
than he looks.

1151
01:14:35.514 --> 01:14:36.733
Thanks. hon.

1152
01:14:37.995 --> 01:14:41.172
Well. he looks geriatric.
I hope so.

1153
01:14:41.346 --> 01:14:43.087
Yeah. I'’m an old man...

1154
01:14:44.305 --> 01:14:46.960
with a double-barrel shotgun
aimed at your head.

1155
01:14:48.527 --> 01:14:49.615
I'’m Mimi.

1156
01:14:51.095 --> 01:14:52.705
An old friend of Ana'’s.

1157
01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:56.840
How about you put
that gun down. friendo?

1158
01:14:58.494 --> 01:14:59.886
Maybe he'’s not all bad.

1159
01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:02.628
He'’s got his moments.

1160
01:15:08.895 --> 01:15:10.462
I really miss you. Anya.

1161
01:15:12.029 --> 01:15:13.900
I miss you too. Mimi.

1162
01:15:25.042 --> 01:15:28.088
Well.
that was fun.

1163
01:15:29.612 --> 01:15:31.222
We should go
to dinner sometime.

1164
01:15:31.396 --> 01:15:33.833
Do a proper catch-up.
leave the boys at home.

1165
01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:35.618
Sure thing.

1166
01:15:37.533 --> 01:15:39.273
Call me. okay?

1167
01:15:39.447 --> 01:15:41.537
Don'’t be such a stranger.

1168
01:15:43.843 --> 01:15:45.541
Thanks for the help.

1169
01:16:09.869 --> 01:16:11.305
Hey.

1170
01:16:14.178 --> 01:16:15.483
I'’m so glad.

1171
01:16:19.444 --> 01:16:20.663
Did you--
Did you--

1172
01:16:22.403 --> 01:16:23.927
No.

1173
01:16:26.799 --> 01:16:28.192
I'’m getting soft.

1174
01:16:34.024 --> 01:16:35.634
Where'’s the hostage?

1175
01:16:37.288 --> 01:16:39.595
I let him go.You what?

1176
01:16:43.294 --> 01:16:44.425
I made the call.

1177
01:16:50.214 --> 01:16:51.781
You made the call.

1178
01:16:51.955 --> 01:16:53.609
Wow.

1179
01:16:53.783 --> 01:16:56.524
I'’m gonna be making the call
a lot more often.

1180
01:16:56.699 --> 01:17:00.006
Not in front of the girls.

1181
01:17:00.877 --> 01:17:02.052
Come here.

1182
01:18:04.114 --> 01:18:05.158
Hmm.

1183
01:18:08.118 --> 01:18:10.076
Ten Gs down the toilet.

1184
01:18:11.774 --> 01:18:13.689
What are we gonna
do now. Pops?

1185
01:18:22.045 --> 01:18:23.742
Fuck. fuck. fuck.

1186
01:18:32.969 --> 01:18:34.231
Hello. lollipop.

1187
01:18:54.425 --> 01:18:55.513

I can always eat.I know. yeah.

1191
01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:11.529
Chérie.

1192
01:19:19.450 --> 01:19:21.539
You'’re so cute
when you speak French.

1193
01:19:29.677 --> 01:19:30.809
Good.

1194
01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:48.305
Oh. Bon appétit.
