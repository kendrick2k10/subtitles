00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:10.565
<i>After the army of Charles XII.
had been defeated at Poltava.</i>

4
00:01:10.738 --> 00:01:15.324
<i>over 10.000 Swedish prisoners
of war were exiled to Siberia.</i>

5
00:01:15.743 --> 00:01:17.985
<i>At the same time in the Far East</i>

6
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.205
<i>the Dzungar Khanate
destroyed the Chinese army.</i>

7
00:01:22.374 --> 00:01:26.618
<i>China needs an ally
more than ever before.</i>

8
00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:31.089
<i>All previous attempts to wage Russia
in the war against the Dzungar Khanate</i>

9
00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:33.337
<i>Failed.</i>

10
00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:37.963
<i>The Chinese call
this gold plate "Paiza".</i>

11
00:01:38.182 --> 00:01:41.516
<i>It is personally handed
over to heads of state.</i>

12
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.018
<i>Whoever accepts the paiza</i>

13
00:01:44.146 --> 00:01:48.015
<i>must go to war on
the side of China.</i>

14
00:01:58.494 --> 00:02:02.283
<i>Tobolsk is the capital of the
Siberian government district.</i>

15
00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:05.949
<i>Here the caravans
lead from the east.</i>

16
00:02:06.085 --> 00:02:12.332
<i>The story begins with the
arrival of a caravan from China.</i>

17
00:02:29.024 --> 00:02:31.607
<i>- Ni hao! Tulishen!
- Ni hao.</i>

18
00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:34.352
How many years haven't we seen each other.
huh?

19
00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:43.703
Congratulations on the
governorship. I have a present for you.

20
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.122
Tulishen. my old friend.

21
00:02:46.917 --> 00:02:51.787
I hope this gift sweetens my
bitter news for the governor.

22
00:02:52.464 --> 00:02:53.796
What news?

23
00:02:57.428 --> 00:02:59.465
His Excellency. the Emperor Qon Si

24
00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:02.304
wants to ban Russian
caravans into the empire.

25
00:03:02.683 --> 00:03:06.267
Has the emperor gone mad?
A caravan brings more profit

26
00:03:06.395 --> 00:03:09.058
as a province in a year.
Why this ban?

27
00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:12.765
Because of the war with the Dzungars.

28
00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.981
This is the golden. imperial Paiza.

29
00:03:17.281 --> 00:03:19.898
The emperor sends
them to his allies.

30
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.702
You shouldn't have done that.

31
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.447
Peter has enough to do with the Swedes.

32
00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:32.168
He is not waging a war against the
Dzungars. He won't accept your Paiza.

33
00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:38.462
Then the sun-like Bogdyhan will
no longer allow Russian caravans.

34
00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:40.877
You can no longer give your tsar.

35
00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:48.389
I know how much Peter appreciates
you. Please convince him to help us.

36
00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:53.476
Hear our request.

37
00:03:55.861 --> 00:03:58.729
You do us a favor.
we do you a favor.

38
00:04:04.286 --> 00:04:07.074
I Agree. Show me your tigers.

39
00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:24.800
Will Russia fight the Dzungars?

40
00:04:25.474 --> 00:04:26.555
Russia?

41
00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:30.225
You don't get an army!

42
00:04:30.354 --> 00:04:31.640
<i>St. Petersburg.</i>

43
00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:33.479
A war against the Dzungars?

44
00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:35.769
Why are you the governor of Siberia?

45
00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:39.485
- To strengthen your state.
- But I do.

46
00:04:39.613 --> 00:04:41.104
Please sign here?

47
00:04:44.618 --> 00:04:46.325
I will build more frigates.

48
00:04:47.538 --> 00:04:50.155
The Swedish ships
are coming this summer.

49
00:04:50.332 --> 00:04:54.326
I only need money from you.
Don't stand around. work!

50
00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:58.080
A caravan to China brings more
than all of Siberia in one year!

51
00:04:58.423 --> 00:05:00.881
Then work. governor. think!
Earn money!

52
00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.467
I need money and
you are asking for war!

53
00:05:04.263 --> 00:05:06.300
It won't be a real war.

54
00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:10.641
The army comes into the steppes.
fires the cannons and the Dzungars flee.

55
00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:14.433
We pay respect to China
and keep the caravans.

56
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.397
Do you think that's fun?

57
00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:19.396
If you fire the cannons once.

58
00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:26.240
A war is enough for me.

59
00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:28.826
Greetings. princess.

60
00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:37.127
His Highness. the Grand Tsar

61
00:05:37.254 --> 00:05:39.211
and grand prince

62
00:05:39.548 --> 00:05:42.382
Peter Alexeyevich Romanov!

63
00:05:42.718 --> 00:05:44.254
Attention!

64
00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:47.883
Nice to see you. my children.

65
00:05:49.433 --> 00:05:53.268
Military skill is the most
important worldly art.

66
00:05:53.854 --> 00:05:56.892
This art brought us
to light from the dark.

67
00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:59.352
I have a premonition...

68
00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:06.194
Just look. Katharina Alexejewitsch.
what I'm giving you on Name Day.

69
00:06:06.742 --> 00:06:09.860
It contains an emerald

70
00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:13.404
here is a sapphire.

71
00:06:13.832 --> 00:06:15.073
How delightful.

72
00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:19.327
Dear mother.
help me convince Peter.

73
00:06:19.921 --> 00:06:22.083
He just doesn't want to give me an army.

74
00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:27.256
As a reward for
deploying the border troops

75
00:06:27.638 --> 00:06:30.802
I hereby award to
all young officers

76
00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:36.686
the rank of lieutenant
in the Russian army!

77
00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:40.432
- Vivat!
- Vivat! Vivat! Vivat!

78
00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:45.729
- I have more of it with diamonds.
- You're a scoundrel. Gagarin.

79
00:06:47.366 --> 00:06:49.983
Peter Alexejewitsch.
your wife has a name day.

80
00:06:50.494 --> 00:06:52.326
You want to reach me through Katharina?

81
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.494
Peter Alexeyevich.
I swear I had no evil intentions.

82
00:06:56.625 --> 00:06:58.366
- Peter.
- What did he want?

83
00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.918
Whining again about his war?

84
00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:02.665
Can I speak? It hurts.

85
00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:07.045
Peter Alexeyevich. I have plans.

86
00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:10.052
I want to bring gold to our nation.

87
00:07:11.098 --> 00:07:12.589
There is a place

88
00:07:21.942 --> 00:07:24.150
there is a mountain full of gold.

89
00:07:24.736 --> 00:07:27.228
We have to organize an expedition.

90
00:07:27.656 --> 00:07:33.994
And then Menshikov rode in
with his dragoons and off we went.

91
00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:38.741
- the Swedes broke up!
- They scurried like startled rabbits.

92
00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:44.041
Yes. and the fattest... The fattest.
he did. he crawled on all fours

93
00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:47.256
and then started trotting.
constantly jumping up and down...

94
00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:50.252
Ivan! Ivan! Ivan!

95
00:07:52.431 --> 00:07:54.047
What's your name. you babbler?

96
00:07:54.558 --> 00:07:55.799
Lieutenant Demarin.

97
00:07:56.143 --> 00:07:59.011
- Education?
- Graduation with Distinction.

98
00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:02.105
in strategy. tactics. artillery.
fortress construction and planning.

99
00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:04.975
Aha. so you are familiar with all of this.
yes?

100
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.818
It can be of use to
us on the expedition.

101
00:08:08.155 --> 00:08:10.568
Say. babbler.
do you want to go to the Tobol?

102
00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:17.157
- Tobol. what is that?
- Your education was not good.

103
00:08:17.289 --> 00:08:20.282
The Tobol is a river in Siberia.
A border river. Lieutenant.

104
00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:23.500
But there is no war.

105
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.537
I'll send you there
so it stays that way.

106
00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:29.541
No matter how you jump around.

107
00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:35.593
you will be surrounded by enemies
on all sides. wherever you jump.

108
00:08:39.436 --> 00:08:44.022
Your Majesty! I studied
military arts abroad

109
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:47.688
to serve my fatherland in battle.

110
00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:49.435
And then should I go to Siberia?

111
00:08:50.155 --> 00:08:53.148
No arguments against the tsar.
you're too young for that.

112
00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:59.116
You youngsters.
I have a mission for you.

113
00:08:59.664 --> 00:09:02.156
Not a war. but a tough trial -

114
00:09:02.501 --> 00:09:05.994
a peaceful expedition to a border.
for gold.

115
00:09:07.214 --> 00:09:10.252
The expedition is led
by Colonel Buhgoltz.

116
00:09:10.842 --> 00:09:14.426
Matthew Petrovich.
give him a dozen officers.

117
00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:17.638
- A dozen? That is not enough.
- Do not interrupt me.

118
00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:22.681
Give him 10 officers. He
will find recruits in Siberia.

119
00:09:23.772 --> 00:09:27.766
The expedition must be peaceful.

120
00:09:28.819 --> 00:09:32.153
- Got it. lieutenant?
- Peter Alexeyevich...

121
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:41.996
Calm down. Dance
while you have legs.

122
00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:47.873
THE BATTLE FOR SIBERIA

123
00:09:48.672 --> 00:09:52.916
TOBOLSK
<i>Again with his crooked hands.</i>

124
00:09:55.178 --> 00:09:57.215
Victor. you bloody son of a bitch!

125
00:09:57.347 --> 00:10:01.091
What are you leaning over
the wall again? Are you blind?

126
00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:04.055
I'll still throw you out of here!

127
00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:09.349
Then you only miss your
wife - if you find enough rope.

128
00:10:16.575 --> 00:10:18.692
What does construction
do? Do the Swedes look up?

129
00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:22.703
Picking up? But no.
they are completely calm.

130
00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:24.823
We can still learn something from them.

131
00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.541
Come on. help the crooked hand!

132
00:10:28.503 --> 00:10:32.998
I'm planning an expedition.
we're looking for gold.

133
00:10:33.884 --> 00:10:35.000
The city of Yerkend.

134
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.756
where is it?

135
00:10:38.722 --> 00:10:40.714
It is a city on the border.

136
00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:44.968
- It takes 14 weeks to get there.
- Oha. that's farther away than Moscow.

137
00:10:45.103 --> 00:10:49.723
Of course. Our border fortress. Kara.

138
00:10:49.858 --> 00:10:53.522
is four weeks away from
Tobolsk. We spend the winter there

139
00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:58.239
and then walk the hostile
steppe for eight weeks.

140
00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:02.948
- Is there gold in Yerkend?
- You say that. yes.

141
00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:06.663
But nobody in Tobolsk has
ever seen the gold from Yerkend.

142
00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:07.827
They lie.

143
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.252
That may be.

144
00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:16.125
I think this is foolishness.
this mission you are planning.

145
00:11:16.927 --> 00:11:18.668
That does not concern you.

146
00:11:20.639 --> 00:11:21.925
The Tsar ordered it.

147
00:11:23.058 --> 00:11:24.390
We have to obey.

148
00:11:26.645 --> 00:11:28.682
The work is over.

149
00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:49.449
This is porridge.

150
00:11:51.086 --> 00:11:52.873
That Russian crap again.

151
00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:57.498
We're in captivity.
Michael. We eat what they give us.

152
00:11:58.218 --> 00:12:00.084
You are a lazy woman. Brigitte.

153
00:12:00.387 --> 00:12:02.970
Everything went for your
drinking. You are addicted!

154
00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:08.809
Whore! I want to stop drinking.
but I just can't make it!

155
00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:19.486
Ivan. you complained that
there were no Swedes to be seen.

156
00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:22.565
There are many here.
they are our prisoners.

157
00:12:23.034 --> 00:12:25.071
Hello Sweden. greetings!

158
00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:26.659
Hello. heroes.

159
00:12:27.831 --> 00:12:28.992
A slime.

160
00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:31.874
What did he say?

161
00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:34.205
He said. "Hello heroes".

162
00:12:38.508 --> 00:12:40.795
Your Excellency. the Tsar's rescript.

163
00:12:41.219 --> 00:12:43.302
All of this is needed for the expedition.

164
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:44.466
Give it to me.

165
00:12:44.806 --> 00:12:49.096
"3.000 uniforms. 200 horses.
70 flat bottom boats. 100 canoes..."

166
00:12:49.686 --> 00:12:54.306
Well. we collect that over the
winter. You will then set out in spring.

167
00:12:55.567 --> 00:12:57.684
- Kuzmichev. Severinov.
- Watch out!

168
00:12:57.819 --> 00:13:00.903
You will be assigned accommodations.

169
00:13:01.489 --> 00:13:04.982
We will stay in Tobolsk for a
while. It only continues in summer.

170
00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:06.484
I warn you.

171
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:11.830
I will not tolerate
any immorality.

172
00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:14.450
- Is that clear?
- Yes. Colonel.

173
00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:17.494
Papa. father!

174
00:13:18.006 --> 00:13:19.963
An officer will live with us.

175
00:13:24.596 --> 00:13:27.134
- Good day.
- Hello. hero.

176
00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:30.098
- Hello.
- I'm Lieutenant Demarin.

177
00:13:31.603 --> 00:13:34.437
- What's your real name?
- Ivan Danilovich.

178
00:13:34.773 --> 00:13:37.481
- Vanya?
- Simeon.

179
00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:42.687
We need a big barrel of cucumbers.
it's all used up.

180
00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:47.112
What do I have to do with cucumbers? Johan.
drive the car down from the yard.

181
00:13:47.911 --> 00:13:48.911
I do.

182
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:09.339
What are you standing around here
for? Don't you have anything to do

183
00:14:10.975 --> 00:14:15.970
Why are you already officers.
are you still so young?

184
00:14:16.314 --> 00:14:22.356
Did you impale a few
Swedish regiments in Poltava?

185
00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:26.864
I wasn't there at all. I studied abroad.
on the orders of the tsar.

186
00:14:28.451 --> 00:14:30.909
Maria.
show our guest where he can wash himself.

187
00:14:31.913 --> 00:14:34.656
What did the Germans teach you?

188
00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:38.163
Where does the bullet
come out from the rifle?

189
00:14:38.188 --> 00:14:39.525
How to fight the enemy.

190
00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:41.336
Then you know.

191
00:14:41.589 --> 00:14:44.502
- Dad. you think everyone is stupid.
- Come to the table.

192
00:14:46.186 --> 00:14:47.266
Come sit down.

193
00:14:47.291 --> 00:14:49.629
I'm not sitting at the
table with the enemy.

194
00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:55.263
He is not an enemy. He is
a prisoner and he helps me.

195
00:14:55.854 --> 00:14:59.643
- I'm sorry. I go.
- Johan. don't be silly.

196
00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:02.942
It is better if I go.

197
00:15:05.446 --> 00:15:06.607
Goodbye.

198
00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:12.906
Well.
apparently he doesn't like our company.

199
00:15:16.082 --> 00:15:19.166
How dare you upset my guest.
boy?

200
00:15:19.836 --> 00:15:21.498
Are you the master in the house here?

201
00:15:23.173 --> 00:15:25.711
You can eat from the trash can!

202
00:15:27.302 --> 00:15:29.760
Conquer your own kitchen.

203
00:15:31.848 --> 00:15:34.511
- But dad!
- Stop me with "Papa"!

204
00:15:38.438 --> 00:15:39.849
Let me go!

205
00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:43.725
I want to go home.
I'm tired. You whore. I want to go home!

206
00:15:44.235 --> 00:15:46.852
I want to go home.
I want to go home...

207
00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:54.242
I don't understand you.
I don't speak German.

208
00:15:54.495 --> 00:15:57.954
Please help me. Carry him home.

209
00:15:58.208 --> 00:15:59.324
You're welcome.

210
00:15:59.876 --> 00:16:01.117
In here.

211
00:16:02.587 --> 00:16:03.703
Caution.

212
00:16:20.939 --> 00:16:23.272
You forgot your hat.

213
00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:26.396
Thank you.

214
00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:30.400
Many thanks for your help.

215
00:16:31.699 --> 00:16:32.735
Johan.

216
00:16:36.704 --> 00:16:39.993
Johan Gustav Renet.
at your service. Ms. Sims.

217
00:16:40.375 --> 00:16:41.866
Brigitte Christina.

218
00:16:43.628 --> 00:16:44.709
I am like you

219
00:16:46.798 --> 00:16:49.290
I do what it takes to survive.

220
00:16:51.302 --> 00:16:52.463
And. does it work?

221
00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.841
Not really.

222
00:16:56.724 --> 00:16:58.556
But I'm not losing hope.

223
00:16:59.185 --> 00:17:01.973
I wish you do that too.

224
00:17:02.981 --> 00:17:07.942
The distances in Russia
hold us back more than chains.

225
00:17:09.195 --> 00:17:10.902
But I'm making up something.

226
00:17:11.656 --> 00:17:13.818
I will be released. I know that.

227
00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:16.616
One day I will

228
00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:20.113
go home. Home to Sweden.

229
00:17:21.791 --> 00:17:22.791
Certainly.

230
00:17:37.849 --> 00:17:38.885
Brigitte.

231
00:17:41.853 --> 00:17:42.934
Brigitte.

232
00:17:44.647 --> 00:17:45.888
Forgive me.

233
00:17:51.738 --> 00:17:52.738
I...

234
00:17:53.489 --> 00:17:55.981
No. No. I...

235
00:17:57.076 --> 00:17:59.318
The war has been going on for 13 years now.

236
00:17:59.954 --> 00:18:01.866
Always in a foreign country.

237
00:18:02.498 --> 00:18:04.205
I want to go back to my home.

238
00:18:08.129 --> 00:18:10.712
Do you want to go with me?

239
00:18:11.966 --> 00:18:13.207
To Sweden?

240
00:18:17.513 --> 00:18:18.754
To Sweden?

241
00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:21.723
Yes very much.

242
00:18:29.776 --> 00:18:31.984
Ivan Danilovich. I have food for you.

243
00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:40.193
- Thanks. I'm not hungry.
- Still so proud.

244
00:18:41.329 --> 00:18:43.161
Eat. I warmed it up in the oven.

245
00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:50.251
Oh. look. an angel in heaven!

246
00:18:50.713 --> 00:18:54.832
It is lucky to see an angel. Not
everyone can do that. Do you see him?

247
00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:58.210
Does your father tell you such fairy tales.
Maria?

248
00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:07.895
- Are you going to eat this?
- No.

249
00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:21.283
Don't forget the bowl!

250
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:32.712
Recruits! With this drum
signals are given in combat.

251
00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:36.128
Every command is
different. That means forward.

252
00:19:40.972 --> 00:19:41.972
Stop!

253
00:19:43.766 --> 00:19:44.847
Slightly slower.

254
00:19:48.771 --> 00:19:49.807
And now you.

255
00:19:51.482 --> 00:19:54.270
Stop it you idiot! Is it
so hard to remember?

256
00:19:56.571 --> 00:20:01.612
- Think a few words about it!
- What words? It's not a song.

257
00:20:02.994 --> 00:20:06.158
<i>Baram. baram. he blows the horn.</i>

258
00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:09.748
- Once again.
<i>- Baram. baram. he blows the horn.</i>

259
00:20:10.084 --> 00:20:13.452
Fine. Remezov. And now
everyone is doing "Baram" together!

260
00:20:13.588 --> 00:20:16.001
<i>Baram. baram. he blows the horn.</i>

261
00:20:16.591 --> 00:20:19.083
<i>Baram. baram. he blows the horn.</i>

262
00:20:19.218 --> 00:20:21.710
And now command
number two. Listen everyone!

263
00:20:24.098 --> 00:20:26.385
<i>Boar is hit. hit the cow.</i>

264
00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:28.934
<i>Boar is hit. hit the cow.</i>

265
00:20:29.437 --> 00:20:31.520
<i>Boar is hit. hit the cow.</i>

266
00:20:31.647 --> 00:20:34.139
- What the hell are you wearing!
- Father! Father!

267
00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:36.900
- Father!
- Get rid of it. that's a military drum!

268
00:20:37.236 --> 00:20:39.569
- I'm a recruit now.
- What? Come here!

269
00:20:39.697 --> 00:20:41.814
Simeon. stop! You disgrace your son.

270
00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.112
Ivan. dissolve his obligation!

271
00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:48.120
- No. serving the country is an honor.
- Yes! Even Tsar Peter served

272
00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:50.195
as a drummer under
Preobrazhensky.

273
00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:52.891
You dwarf.
I'll lock you in the steam bath!

274
00:20:53.628 --> 00:20:57.668
As long as the army is here. you are
dealing with birch branches. not drums.

275
00:20:57.798 --> 00:21:00.006
- you fool!
- All the men with us have served.

276
00:21:00.134 --> 00:21:01.966
Should I sit around like a girl?

277
00:21:02.803 --> 00:21:06.843
You are responsible for that.
Ivan. Arms. wars. victories...

278
00:21:07.475 --> 00:21:09.717
- Let him out of there!
- I just told Peter

279
00:21:09.852 --> 00:21:11.514
what I think is right.

280
00:21:11.854 --> 00:21:14.267
To serve the tsar
is a sacred mission.

281
00:21:14.398 --> 00:21:17.357
You have to understand
that! The state is strong

282
00:21:17.485 --> 00:21:19.943
- because we make sacrifices!
- Get out of here.

283
00:21:20.071 --> 00:21:21.687
- It's already decided!
- What?

284
00:21:22.573 --> 00:21:25.611
I'll be on a mission. father.

285
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:37.962
Then... to die in the steppe.
you gun fool!

286
00:21:38.381 --> 00:21:41.715
Just get out of my house.
you snake!

287
00:21:48.099 --> 00:21:53.015
Maria.
I'm a recruit now. I will bring gold home.

288
00:21:53.187 --> 00:21:58.182
<i>Tobolsk. winter festival. in 1715.</i>

289
00:21:58.359 --> 00:21:59.475
Don't look there!

290
00:22:01.612 --> 00:22:04.696
Buy. buy...

291
00:22:20.298 --> 00:22:22.585
Why is such a
magical lady alone?

292
00:22:22.717 --> 00:22:26.677
- I'm looking for Ivan.
- Allow me to protect you.

293
00:22:26.804 --> 00:22:30.764
- All right.
- How lucky is Ivan.

294
00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:37.771
- I would give my life for you.
- Yes. get out of there! Women. women!

295
00:22:38.399 --> 00:22:41.233
Michael! Michael. rest. come on.

296
00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:44.853
- He's on guard duty. I'll go with you.
- They ran like women.

297
00:22:44.989 --> 00:22:46.901
Women. women!

298
00:22:48.993 --> 00:22:50.859
Josy! Josy. Josy!

299
00:22:51.954 --> 00:22:53.991
Josy. where's Johan?

300
00:22:54.957 --> 00:22:57.165
Where's Johan? Where's Johan?

301
00:23:02.548 --> 00:23:04.631
Higher. up to the roof!

302
00:23:05.301 --> 00:23:08.294
Hello. Ivan. I have pies for you.

303
00:23:08.429 --> 00:23:09.715
Ivan. say hello.

304
00:23:10.389 --> 00:23:11.596
Good day Madame.

305
00:23:12.516 --> 00:23:14.849
Why are you embarrassing
me in front of my recruits?

306
00:23:15.102 --> 00:23:19.517
Oh. Ivan. "Hello. madam".
with such a pretty girl...

307
00:23:20.316 --> 00:23:22.683
Help yourself. I made it myself.

308
00:23:24.111 --> 00:23:27.400
- I can't. I'm on duty.
- Not me. What's in there?

309
00:23:27.657 --> 00:23:30.149
In which mushrooms. And here fish.

310
00:23:35.915 --> 00:23:38.157
- Johan.
- Out of the way!

311
00:23:38.292 --> 00:23:39.328
Johan.

312
00:23:40.586 --> 00:23:42.122
I miss you. Johan.

313
00:23:43.506 --> 00:23:44.792
Come here.

314
00:23:46.592 --> 00:23:49.005
- Here.
- Lord. I ask you today...

315
00:23:49.136 --> 00:23:52.629
- Leave the church. go with God.
- Father. I have to confess...

316
00:23:52.765 --> 00:23:55.974
- Let it go. father.
- Oh my sins...

317
00:23:56.102 --> 00:23:57.843
- Please come.
- Let me!

318
00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.020
Moderate yourself!

319
00:23:59.355 --> 00:24:00.516
- Come on.
- Get there!

320
00:24:02.441 --> 00:24:04.433
I want to kiss you. Johan.

321
00:24:06.362 --> 00:24:07.694
Me too. Brigitte.

322
00:24:09.156 --> 00:24:12.991
I as leader are thrown
out of the church.

323
00:24:13.119 --> 00:24:15.452
Come on. we're going to the pub.

324
00:24:17.248 --> 00:24:18.364
Get out of here!

325
00:24:33.305 --> 00:24:35.171
You devil!

326
00:24:44.859 --> 00:24:47.226
No! No no! No!

327
00:24:48.612 --> 00:24:49.898
No. not!

328
00:24:51.282 --> 00:24:54.150
Stay away from her. this is my wife!

329
00:25:06.839 --> 00:25:08.831
- You bitch!
- Brigitte!

330
00:25:14.221 --> 00:25:16.213
You born of the Saracens!

331
00:25:18.559 --> 00:25:21.427
People. listen! Beat up the Swedes!

332
00:25:25.941 --> 00:25:29.935
Our men are being beaten
up! The Swedes rebel!

333
00:25:30.112 --> 00:25:33.901
Soldier.
report to the major! Alert the company!

334
00:25:34.492 --> 00:25:36.154
- Peter is here!
- Where?

335
00:25:36.452 --> 00:25:37.488
On the marketplace.

336
00:25:48.506 --> 00:25:51.089
- I will kill you!
- Uncle. what the hell!?

337
00:25:52.676 --> 00:25:54.508
You snake. come down there!

338
00:26:02.728 --> 00:26:04.060
That is your end.

339
00:26:09.193 --> 00:26:10.193
Uncle!

340
00:26:14.073 --> 00:26:15.439
Say goodbye. soldier.

341
00:26:18.369 --> 00:26:21.578
Not! Don't kill me. soldier!

342
00:26:25.167 --> 00:26:27.534
Close the ranks!

343
00:26:34.552 --> 00:26:37.090
- End the fight!
- Apart!

344
00:26:37.429 --> 00:26:39.716
- Calm down. calm down!
- Back!

345
00:26:39.849 --> 00:26:43.092
Calm down! Everyone back. immediately!

346
00:26:43.394 --> 00:26:46.182
- On which side are you?
- Ivan!

347
00:26:49.859 --> 00:26:52.146
- Calm down!
- Stays with me!

348
00:26:58.534 --> 00:26:59.741
Back with you!

349
00:27:02.621 --> 00:27:05.910
- Back!
- Ivan. I can do it. just wait.

350
00:27:22.558 --> 00:27:23.558
On him!

351
00:27:27.229 --> 00:27:30.848
- All together. men!
- Over the heads! Put on!

352
00:27:35.613 --> 00:27:37.149
- Away with you!
- Fire!

353
00:27:38.866 --> 00:27:40.607
Round two. ready to attack!

354
00:27:42.328 --> 00:27:45.036
- Stop. the army is behind you!
- Down with them!

355
00:27:45.164 --> 00:27:46.164
Fire!

356
00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.256
Quiet!

357
00:28:01.597 --> 00:28:04.010
Do you want a second Poltava. you devil?

358
00:28:04.391 --> 00:28:06.132
Do the Swedes rebel?

359
00:28:08.395 --> 00:28:10.603
Only drunks are fighting.
governor.

360
00:28:11.315 --> 00:28:14.149
That Swedish asshole started.

361
00:28:14.526 --> 00:28:16.688
Locks up all rebels.
including ours.

362
00:28:17.363 --> 00:28:18.570
He started it!

363
00:28:19.406 --> 00:28:23.275
- I had nothing to do with it!
- You have good recruits. Colonel.

364
00:28:27.873 --> 00:28:30.786
for an expedition. It will
be a peaceful operation.

365
00:28:36.048 --> 00:28:38.586
And did you find
out who started?

366
00:28:38.717 --> 00:28:41.881
Everyone says it was a Swede.
Johan Renet.

367
00:28:42.096 --> 00:28:46.557
- Well. hang him.
- Governor. sir. I'm begging you!

368
00:28:46.725 --> 00:28:48.762
Please leave him. he is innocent!

369
00:28:50.187 --> 00:28:54.101
- We release your husband. don't worry.
- No. I mean Johan Renet.

370
00:28:54.566 --> 00:28:57.934
What. Johan Renet? I don't
want to hear about that. he started!

371
00:28:58.278 --> 00:28:59.769
- go!
- No. I'm begging you!

372
00:29:02.908 --> 00:29:07.494
I love Johan Renet.
we want to go home together.

373
00:29:08.163 --> 00:29:12.077
- I'm begging you. please!
- Then you goaded the boys on?

374
00:29:14.336 --> 00:29:16.453
- I am guilty.
- They are not Germans.

375
00:29:16.588 --> 00:29:20.377
- but gypsies.
- You should come to a cold cell.

376
00:29:21.135 --> 00:29:23.673
- So you love him?
- Very.

377
00:29:23.804 --> 00:29:28.014
- Fine. I'll take care of it. Go.
- Thanks a lot.

378
00:29:31.395 --> 00:29:33.808
Allow me to say something. Colonel.

379
00:29:33.939 --> 00:29:38.434
- Go ahead.
- We should all owe Sweden

380
00:29:38.569 --> 00:29:39.980
hire as recruits.

381
00:29:43.866 --> 00:29:45.607
- The Sweden?
- Yes.

382
00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:49.744
If they swear the oath.
we can take them with them.

383
00:29:49.872 --> 00:29:52.615
You have a lot of
officers. I saw her fight.

384
00:29:53.042 --> 00:29:55.785
- Go ahead. less trouble for me.
- Wait. wait.

385
00:29:55.961 --> 00:29:58.453
Do you really want
to arm our enemies?

386
00:29:58.589 --> 00:30:01.172
- He should take it. yes.
- The Tsar did that too.

387
00:30:03.635 --> 00:30:06.503
Well then. I'll appoint you. Lieutenant.

388
00:30:06.638 --> 00:30:10.052
to the leader of the Swedish
squadron on the expedition.

389
00:30:12.227 --> 00:30:13.968
Go ahead! But no failure.

390
00:30:15.397 --> 00:30:16.478
Yes my Lord.

391
00:30:16.899 --> 00:30:20.483
I started but it wasn't a riot.

392
00:30:21.028 --> 00:30:25.068
I decide what happens. It's hard
to prove anything from the gallows.

393
00:30:26.742 --> 00:30:31.077
You will never see your wife again.

394
00:30:32.372 --> 00:30:35.740
I know about you. Capiton.
leave us alone.

395
00:30:43.884 --> 00:30:47.798
Do you want to go out here as a free man?

396
00:30:48.764 --> 00:30:50.881
Are you kidding. Mister Governor?

397
00:30:51.016 --> 00:30:53.724
No.
I'm not kidding. I want to help you.

398
00:30:54.645 --> 00:30:57.888
You will register for the
regiment going to Yerkent.

399
00:30:58.398 --> 00:31:01.812
- But I don't want to recruit for it.
- Keep your mouth shut.

400
00:31:34.184 --> 00:31:38.349
<i>Summer has started. The
expedition was ready to go.</i>

401
00:31:39.148 --> 00:31:42.767
Remember Peter if
something happens to you

402
00:31:43.277 --> 00:31:44.688
- will your mother...
- Simeon?

403
00:31:45.195 --> 00:31:47.482
- What?
- What do you know about the Dzungars?

404
00:31:47.698 --> 00:31:51.567
- How many are there?
- What do you want to hear - 1.000? 10.000?

405
00:31:51.785 --> 00:31:54.573
- And you military?
- This is just a mounted horde.

406
00:31:54.705 --> 00:31:57.994
If you overrun this horde.
there's nothing left!

407
00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:08.545
Brigitte.

408
00:32:14.183 --> 00:32:16.425
I know everything about
you and this Swede.

409
00:32:17.352 --> 00:32:20.641
But he will leave us today and
you will never see each other again.

410
00:32:21.356 --> 00:32:23.689
I am very sorry.
everything is my fault.

411
00:32:24.276 --> 00:32:26.313
Let's start over.

412
00:32:27.321 --> 00:32:29.483
I swear I stop drinking.

413
00:32:30.657 --> 00:32:32.364
You're drunk now.

414
00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.493
Today is also a festive day.

415
00:32:36.163 --> 00:32:37.163
Which one?

416
00:32:37.664 --> 00:32:40.122
With you every day is a festive day.

417
00:32:45.672 --> 00:32:48.255
Take that and go celebrate.

418
00:32:51.553 --> 00:32:54.341
I swear this is the last time.

419
00:32:54.473 --> 00:32:56.806
I love you. That is the last time.

420
00:32:57.351 --> 00:32:59.263
- I know.
- The last time.

421
00:33:00.896 --> 00:33:02.307
The last time.

422
00:33:15.994 --> 00:33:17.155
Hello. Swede.

423
00:33:20.916 --> 00:33:24.330
- Did you say goodbye to your loved one?
- Not yet. Mr. Governor.

424
00:33:24.461 --> 00:33:26.748
- Good.
- This is the way to Kara.

425
00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.712
Where are the positions of the Dzungars?

426
00:33:30.676 --> 00:33:33.760
Your country begins on this bank.

427
00:33:33.887 --> 00:33:36.504
- And here?
- You will spend the winter here.

428
00:33:38.433 --> 00:33:40.470
This effort gives you freedom.

429
00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.601
And Brigitte?

430
00:33:43.689 --> 00:33:47.683
She comes with the first caravan.
I keep my word. Hopefully you too.

431
00:33:48.151 --> 00:33:49.642
- Good luck. Uhan.
- Johan.

432
00:33:50.696 --> 00:33:51.857
Johan. Johan.

433
00:34:01.873 --> 00:34:03.114
Johan.

434
00:34:04.501 --> 00:34:06.163
I will not see you again

435
00:34:07.504 --> 00:34:10.747
You have to leave Tobolsk
with the first caravan.

436
00:34:11.133 --> 00:34:12.544
What? Why?

437
00:34:12.718 --> 00:34:15.005
Do you want us
to be free together?

438
00:34:15.554 --> 00:34:19.013
- Yes.
- Then do what I tell you.

439
00:34:19.182 --> 00:34:21.799
I don't understand it.
but I do what you want.

440
00:34:21.935 --> 00:34:23.096
- For sure?
- For sure.

441
00:34:23.395 --> 00:34:25.011
Then kiss me. Brigitte.

442
00:34:32.112 --> 00:34:35.651
Take a thick scarf with
you. It will keep you warm.

443
00:34:35.782 --> 00:34:38.274
- Is not allowed.
- Come on. come on.

444
00:34:38.410 --> 00:34:41.699
Ivan.
frost doesn't care what is allowed.

445
00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:45.498
Kuzmichev. Cast off!

446
00:34:45.625 --> 00:34:47.958
- Lay down!
- Come on!

447
00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:52.590
Remember Peter.

448
00:34:54.009 --> 00:34:57.127
All Remezovs served
faithfully. Don't shame us!

449
00:34:59.431 --> 00:35:02.139
Where are you going
with your crooked hands?

450
00:35:11.193 --> 00:35:15.688
Maria. if you had accompanied me.
I would not have left without a kiss.

451
00:35:15.822 --> 00:35:16.822
Ozharovsky!

452
00:35:20.327 --> 00:35:23.286
Maria! Maria! What should...

453
00:35:24.873 --> 00:35:27.035
W-Why are you embarrassing
me in front of everyone?

454
00:35:27.459 --> 00:35:28.459
What shoud that?

455
00:35:28.543 --> 00:35:31.661
- Ivan. come on now!
- Maria. go home.

456
00:35:37.969 --> 00:35:39.585
Come on. come on!

457
00:35:40.972 --> 00:35:42.338
Ozharovsky.

458
00:35:45.143 --> 00:35:48.181
- Ivan. you are so harsh.
- Maria!

459
00:35:49.981 --> 00:35:51.938
I ask you to go home!

460
00:36:08.583 --> 00:36:09.619
Johan!

461
00:36:10.377 --> 00:36:12.369
- were you a shooter?
- At the artillery.

462
00:36:12.879 --> 00:36:14.962
Are your cannons better than ours?

463
00:36:16.508 --> 00:36:18.670
I like those that are never fired.

464
00:36:19.469 --> 00:36:20.469
I agree...

465
00:36:21.471 --> 00:36:23.258
And which shooters are better?

466
00:36:28.895 --> 00:36:30.386
Why did you save me

467
00:36:31.481 --> 00:36:34.349
- I don't understand...
- You pulled me out of the fight.

468
00:36:34.734 --> 00:36:37.602
You want to die in battle.
not in a brawl.

469
00:36:37.863 --> 00:36:40.105
That a Swede will save me sometime...

470
00:36:40.699 --> 00:36:42.190
But why? You are the enemy.

471
00:36:42.534 --> 00:36:46.744
Quiet. Ivan.
we're on one side now.

472
00:36:47.205 --> 00:36:48.241
Listen.

473
00:36:49.541 --> 00:36:51.533
I still wanted to thank you.

474
00:37:02.345 --> 00:37:05.713
How boring.
we drag ourselves like cows.

475
00:37:05.849 --> 00:37:08.011
We never make it this way until winter.

476
00:37:08.518 --> 00:37:10.305
Ivan! Come on. we're going to race.

477
00:37:10.712 --> 00:37:11.791
Good idea.

478
00:37:11.816 --> 00:37:14.750
You don't have enough
in your stomach for a race.

479
00:37:14.858 --> 00:37:16.690
Brothers. we leave Sweden behind!

480
00:37:16.818 --> 00:37:18.730
Of course we can...

481
00:37:18.862 --> 00:37:21.650
We defeated you at
Poltava. It works here too.

482
00:37:21.781 --> 00:37:24.569
I never saw you in Poltava.

483
00:37:25.118 --> 00:37:27.656
That day you
sucked mom's breast.

484
00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:30.696
Peter. if you keep chatting like this

485
00:37:30.832 --> 00:37:33.119
Uncle Johan will drown
you with your drum.

486
00:37:33.251 --> 00:37:35.743
- A drum doesn't sink.
- But you do.

487
00:37:35.879 --> 00:37:37.759
It's a good thing that
everyone knows that now.

488
00:37:41.343 --> 00:37:45.929
But I have one condition. If the
Swedes are led by a Russian.

489
00:37:46.932 --> 00:37:49.219
a Swede must lead
the Russians. Clear?

490
00:37:49.559 --> 00:37:50.675
Johan Renet!

491
00:37:51.436 --> 00:37:53.223
Come over to the Russian boat!

492
00:37:56.525 --> 00:37:59.484
- And pull through!
- Pull through!

493
00:38:02.614 --> 00:38:06.153
- Goodbye!
- We'll get the Swedes! Peter. drum!

494
00:38:07.536 --> 00:38:09.448
- Hang in there!
- Pull through!

495
00:38:21.341 --> 00:38:22.457
Go away!

496
00:38:22.968 --> 00:38:24.709
- oar up!
- Keep your distance!

497
00:38:24.928 --> 00:38:26.260
Push them away!

498
00:38:28.348 --> 00:38:29.429
Where to?

499
00:38:32.894 --> 00:38:35.181
- We were the first!
- No we!

500
00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.938
- Brothers. help!
- Stop rowing!

501
00:38:38.525 --> 00:38:41.609
- stop! Be quiet!
- Peter! Peter is drowning!

502
00:38:41.736 --> 00:38:44.069
- Peter! Peter!
- I am drowning!

503
00:38:47.033 --> 00:38:48.194
- Peter!
- I am drowning!

504
00:38:53.039 --> 00:38:54.655
But it's flat here!

505
00:38:54.791 --> 00:38:57.374
Yes for you. I could drown here.

506
00:38:57.502 --> 00:38:58.502
High with you

507
00:39:02.882 --> 00:39:04.589
Why are you screaming. Ivan?

508
00:39:07.429 --> 00:39:10.012
Brothers! Ivan caught a fish!

509
00:39:11.391 --> 00:39:12.802
Come on. get the fish!

510
00:39:13.143 --> 00:39:15.760
- What do they have there?
- A fish. colonel.

511
00:39:17.063 --> 00:39:18.063
Ivan. get him out!

512
00:39:19.441 --> 00:39:20.441
Come on with it!

513
00:39:22.694 --> 00:39:25.277
Come on. throw him here! Throw him to me!

514
00:39:27.282 --> 00:39:28.318
I have him!

515
00:39:29.326 --> 00:39:30.817
Our fish is bigger.

516
00:39:35.248 --> 00:39:38.992
<i>Kara fortress. eight months later.</i>

517
00:39:39.169 --> 00:39:41.582
<i>Winter was coming to an end.</i>

518
00:39:42.505 --> 00:39:46.169
We were paralyzed for
most of the winter. Come over!

519
00:39:47.093 --> 00:39:50.177
We weren't allowed to shoot.
the gunpowder was limited.

520
00:39:50.388 --> 00:39:53.256
- I thought there was war.
- You hit my sore spot.

521
00:39:54.434 --> 00:39:56.221
We hunt the Swedes in Europe

522
00:39:56.353 --> 00:39:58.561
and I'm doing laps in the steppe here.

523
00:39:59.272 --> 00:40:00.272
Stop!

524
00:40:06.488 --> 00:40:08.229
Peter. give the alarm.

525
00:40:27.342 --> 00:40:29.675
I am Lieutenant Demarin. Who are you?

526
00:40:31.012 --> 00:40:33.299
That is the great Zaisang Onhudai.

527
00:40:34.265 --> 00:40:36.006
What is the reason for your visit?

528
00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:44.189
Don't waste time.
Russian. Take us to the fortress.

529
00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.527
Reverse!

530
00:40:49.739 --> 00:40:52.072
Recruit Remezov.
gives the signal to open the gate.

531
00:41:18.476 --> 00:41:21.435
Why are the Russian
armed forces here?

532
00:41:22.731 --> 00:41:25.849
Don't you want peace with me

533
00:41:26.151 --> 00:41:27.437
We come in peace.

534
00:41:28.236 --> 00:41:30.148
I invited you here.

535
00:41:30.822 --> 00:41:33.280
I'll show you my defenses.

536
00:41:35.618 --> 00:41:36.950
Good cannons.

537
00:41:38.955 --> 00:41:40.162
That means trust.

538
00:41:43.293 --> 00:41:44.704
You are our friends. yes?

539
00:41:46.588 --> 00:41:47.749
We don't want a fight.

540
00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:54.127
Please accept our hospitality.

541
00:41:55.597 --> 00:41:57.463
I hope that can convince you.

542
00:41:58.933 --> 00:42:01.016
And who is this?

543
00:42:01.686 --> 00:42:03.803
A Zaisang. a leader of the Dzungars.

544
00:42:08.151 --> 00:42:09.813
Johan Renet!

545
00:42:10.779 --> 00:42:12.361
Johan Renet!

546
00:42:14.157 --> 00:42:16.023
Where's Johan Renet. huh?

547
00:42:17.035 --> 00:42:21.996
- I don't know.
- Then find him! Come on!

548
00:42:22.707 --> 00:42:25.950
We have run out of everything
twice. The squire is gone.

549
00:42:35.804 --> 00:42:36.804
Here.

550
00:42:40.725 --> 00:42:43.468
I stole that from the
Russian governor Gagarin.

551
00:43:01.079 --> 00:43:05.494
No! You don't understand that!
You... you don't understand that!

552
00:43:06.084 --> 00:43:08.667
The Russians have made
an agreement with China.

553
00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:11.082
You want to start a war here!

554
00:43:14.092 --> 00:43:17.085
I am not here to fight.

555
00:43:18.137 --> 00:43:20.174
What did you do in your army

556
00:43:20.306 --> 00:43:23.640
I'm an artilleryman. I fire cannons.

557
00:43:23.768 --> 00:43:28.854
It is a gift. The ghosts of the steppe
have brought you to the great Zaisang.

558
00:43:33.945 --> 00:43:36.187
With hay in your shoes.
your feet don't freeze.

559
00:43:36.322 --> 00:43:40.032
- I know that.
- Wait. Take the scarf

560
00:43:40.159 --> 00:43:42.401
- and wrap it around you.
- Maria's gift?

561
00:43:42.537 --> 00:43:44.449
That does not concern you. Wrap already!

562
00:43:44.581 --> 00:43:48.074
Are you an old grandma Shut your mouth!

563
00:43:48.543 --> 00:43:51.081
- You are a beautiful leader.
- Your sister wants

564
00:43:51.212 --> 00:43:53.124
that I take care of you

565
00:43:53.464 --> 00:43:57.583
You're so in love with her.
Ivan. That will end badly with you.

566
00:44:00.138 --> 00:44:02.346
So I'm going now.

567
00:44:40.762 --> 00:44:41.969
It is a trap!

568
00:44:57.779 --> 00:44:58.860
You know.

569
00:45:00.949 --> 00:45:02.941
why didn't they kill you?

570
00:45:18.299 --> 00:45:21.007
What are you waiting for? Drums.
otherwise they won't open.

571
00:45:23.054 --> 00:45:24.215
Come on. drum.

572
00:45:24.639 --> 00:45:28.724
<i>Listen to me. The most important command is</i>

573
00:45:28.935 --> 00:45:30.676
Article seven:

574
00:45:32.897 --> 00:45:33.933
the alarm.

575
00:45:39.737 --> 00:45:44.027
<i>Save the city. Prophet Elijah
Save the city. Prophet Elijah.</i>

576
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.832
Why so quiet are you frozen?

577
00:45:55.169 --> 00:45:56.535
Open the gate!

578
00:45:59.507 --> 00:46:01.840
<i>- Save the city. Prophet Elijah.
- All together!</i>

579
00:46:01.968 --> 00:46:05.678
<i>Save the city. Prophet Elijah
Save the city. Prophet Elijah.</i>

580
00:46:05.805 --> 00:46:08.798
- Again!
<i>- Save the city. Prophet Elijah.</i>

581
00:46:08.933 --> 00:46:13.473
<i>Save the city. Prophet Elijah
Save the city. Prophet Elijah.</i>

582
00:46:26.492 --> 00:46:27.492
The alarm!

583
00:46:31.247 --> 00:46:33.534
- Stop him!
- Cover me. boys!

584
00:46:33.833 --> 00:46:35.790
- Kill him!
- Let me!

585
00:46:39.255 --> 00:46:40.587
Peter!

586
00:47:12.955 --> 00:47:15.288
We bury a brave recruit.

587
00:47:16.375 --> 00:47:18.458
A real Russian soldier.

588
00:47:19.712 --> 00:47:21.954
His deed is an example for all of us.

589
00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:23.831
For the last honor...

590
00:47:23.966 --> 00:47:25.923
He wasn't afraid of the enemy

591
00:47:26.052 --> 00:47:28.590
and gave his life for his comrades.

592
00:47:28.721 --> 00:47:30.838
Put on! Fire!

593
00:47:40.108 --> 00:47:41.108
Ivan.

594
00:47:42.235 --> 00:47:43.235
Ivan!

595
00:47:46.739 --> 00:47:50.824
We are all soldiers. Ivan. We are
all under God and serve the tsar.

596
00:47:51.285 --> 00:47:55.529
Don't blame yourself. You
are not to blame for his death.

597
00:47:56.916 --> 00:48:00.375
But why the Dzungar
attack? We are not at war.

598
00:48:02.922 --> 00:48:04.584
That also concerns me.

599
00:48:10.596 --> 00:48:13.134
You attacked at night.

600
00:48:13.975 --> 00:48:15.386
Our guards were killed.

601
00:48:16.269 --> 00:48:18.352
We have not provoked war.

602
00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:20.846
Why did you do that

603
00:48:26.487 --> 00:48:27.819
Junker. there you are!

604
00:48:30.741 --> 00:48:31.822
You live...

605
00:48:35.663 --> 00:48:36.870
Alarm!

606
00:48:36.998 --> 00:48:39.240
- The Dzungars are coming!
- The Dzungars are coming!

607
00:49:10.072 --> 00:49:12.940
TOBOLSK

608
00:49:13.075 --> 00:49:17.911
Hey.
out of the way! A message for the governor!

609
00:49:21.334 --> 00:49:22.450
Take the horse.

610
00:49:30.301 --> 00:49:34.170
- You called me. governor?
- So it is. Simeon.

611
00:49:35.932 --> 00:49:39.141
The soldier Iegor Bykov
is standing in front of you.

612
00:49:40.019 --> 00:49:42.557
He is a messenger for Colonel Buhgoltz.
from the fort.

613
00:49:43.522 --> 00:49:44.854
Tell him. Iegor.

614
00:49:47.151 --> 00:49:50.189
Peter Remezov. your son.

615
00:49:51.822 --> 00:49:53.529
was killed by the Dzungars.

616
00:49:55.576 --> 00:49:59.240
Believe me. Simeon.
it also causes me great pain.

617
00:50:00.206 --> 00:50:03.995
Buhgoltz writes that the Dzungars
encircled her in the fortress.

618
00:50:04.377 --> 00:50:08.212
- The stocks are almost exhausted.
- Then we have to Buhgoltz

619
00:50:08.839 --> 00:50:11.252
- come to help.
- Yeah. just how?

620
00:50:11.926 --> 00:50:13.007
The cash register is empty.

621
00:50:33.864 --> 00:50:36.322
Father. mother. how can that be?

622
00:50:36.617 --> 00:50:39.200
Without our help they will die!

623
00:50:39.328 --> 00:50:41.786
Are you worried about your Ivan?

624
00:50:42.164 --> 00:50:45.077
You have a stone heart.
you tainted girl!

625
00:50:45.209 --> 00:50:47.496
I cry for Peter too!

626
00:50:47.628 --> 00:50:51.998
Peter served. All
Remezovs have served.

627
00:50:52.133 --> 00:50:53.874
Russians are in need.

628
00:50:54.844 --> 00:50:56.176
We have to help them.

629
00:50:57.346 --> 00:50:59.759
Take sin from your
soul and forgive it.

630
00:51:00.516 --> 00:51:02.678
Anger does not heal a heart.

631
00:51:03.561 --> 00:51:05.177
We have to save them.

632
00:51:06.647 --> 00:51:09.310
Nobody can get on the train without you.

633
00:51:09.775 --> 00:51:11.562
Have you all conspired?

634
00:51:13.154 --> 00:51:17.819
I do not go anywhere!
And I won't let you go!

635
00:51:17.992 --> 00:51:20.905
Let the governor
take care of the train!

636
00:51:21.412 --> 00:51:22.573
Got it?

637
00:51:23.789 --> 00:51:29.956
Simeon. I'll give you the rest
of Peter's christening candle.

638
00:51:32.089 --> 00:51:33.751
Find his grave

639
00:51:37.303 --> 00:51:39.010
and light it there.

640
00:51:40.639 --> 00:51:44.178
He will see the fire from the sky.

641
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:54.227
That will then... warm his soul.

642
00:51:55.988 --> 00:51:56.988
Yes mother.

643
00:51:58.741 --> 00:52:00.858
I'll do that. yes...

644
00:52:00.993 --> 00:52:03.906
- Father. I'm going with you.
- Me too.

645
00:52:07.333 --> 00:52:12.579
But when something happens.
our home has no man.

646
00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:16.294
- Then take me with you. father.
- You won't go.

647
00:52:17.301 --> 00:52:23.514
I will find your Ivan and
strangle him by hand!

648
00:52:23.849 --> 00:52:26.967
- That bastard!
- If you do that. I will run away. father!

649
00:52:28.521 --> 00:52:31.764
Barrels with cast iron balls. Five batches.
100 wagons.

650
00:52:31.982 --> 00:52:35.441
Lock wheels. boxes with flints.

651
00:52:35.861 --> 00:52:37.602
- 20 ropes.
- Hold on.

652
00:52:37.738 --> 00:52:43.109
Cannons. boards. tar barrels.

653
00:52:43.494 --> 00:52:46.157
The pharmacy box.
tell me what's in there.

654
00:52:46.288 --> 00:52:50.032
All right then. Garlic. heather.

655
00:52:50.167 --> 00:52:52.784
- celandine. absinthe...
- Good thing.

656
00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:54.752
- and pine oil.
- Good.

657
00:52:56.090 --> 00:52:58.002
Wish your friend health.

658
00:52:58.759 --> 00:53:01.001
Just see how much
we have gathered.

659
00:53:02.138 --> 00:53:03.800
It is thanks to the people.

660
00:53:08.185 --> 00:53:10.928
- Simeon. just look!
- Take care of your mother.

661
00:53:11.063 --> 00:53:14.272
Look.
Simeon! The angel gives us his blessing.

662
00:53:14.483 --> 00:53:17.647
This is the smoke from the
Tobolsk chimneys. An angel...

663
00:53:21.282 --> 00:53:24.070
God protect you.
Simeon. Take care of Maria.

664
00:53:25.161 --> 00:53:26.161
Farewell. Remezov.

665
00:53:28.205 --> 00:53:29.241
I agree.

666
00:53:32.376 --> 00:53:33.412
God be with you.

667
00:54:00.279 --> 00:54:02.111
Are you Simeon Remezov's daughter?

668
00:54:02.364 --> 00:54:05.198
Yes. Peter. my brother.
was killed by the Dzungars.

669
00:54:05.367 --> 00:54:09.907
I cried for him for a week. but also
thought about Ivan at the same time.

670
00:54:10.748 --> 00:54:15.163
Even if it angered father.
I definitely have to go to Ivan.

671
00:54:15.711 --> 00:54:18.579
Ivan. the Russian officer?

672
00:54:18.714 --> 00:54:19.714
Yes.

673
00:54:20.716 --> 00:54:24.380
I love him so much. I would also
follow him barefoot in the snow.

674
00:54:25.054 --> 00:54:26.295
I can understand.

675
00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:31.633
I'll tell you a secret: I want
to see my loved one too.

676
00:54:32.770 --> 00:54:35.979
You have to follow love.

677
00:54:36.273 --> 00:54:38.515
Otherwise our heart dies.

678
00:55:05.511 --> 00:55:08.629
<i>Kara fortress. four weeks later.</i>

679
00:55:08.764 --> 00:55:11.677
The replenishment train!
The replenishment train!

680
00:55:21.068 --> 00:55:24.106
And will we greet them
with bread and salt?

681
00:55:25.322 --> 00:55:26.438
Just look.

682
00:55:32.037 --> 00:55:35.656
Brothers. they come with the nomads.

683
00:55:40.462 --> 00:55:42.545
We have to fight them now.

684
00:55:42.715 --> 00:55:43.831
No. be patient.

685
00:56:16.832 --> 00:56:18.949
My daughter... my daughter.

686
00:56:50.157 --> 00:56:54.618
Everything is fine now.
Yohan. We are together and we are free.

687
00:56:54.745 --> 00:56:56.987
That's not true. my love.

688
00:56:57.122 --> 00:56:59.739
I have to serve him

689
00:57:00.376 --> 00:57:02.288
that is the price of my freedom.

690
00:57:03.295 --> 00:57:06.038
I'm a soldier again
and I'm at war again.

691
00:57:07.132 --> 00:57:11.092
But you are strong and I am
also strong. And we are together.

692
00:57:11.970 --> 00:57:13.336
Where do we go?

693
00:57:13.764 --> 00:57:17.633
Welcome to the palace. my queen.

694
00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:31.779
How comfortable it is here.

695
00:57:32.616 --> 00:57:34.152
With you already.

696
00:58:22.499 --> 00:58:25.037
Ivan Danilovich. there comes a man!

697
00:58:25.169 --> 00:58:27.707
A man outside in the steppe!

698
00:59:08.879 --> 00:59:10.120
Simeon.

699
00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:15.842
Simeon.

700
00:59:20.682 --> 00:59:22.548
Where is my son?

701
00:59:38.283 --> 00:59:39.774
Hi Peter.

702
00:59:41.703 --> 00:59:43.786
I am your father.

703
00:59:51.588 --> 00:59:53.750
I wanted to be with you.

704
00:59:55.175 --> 00:59:57.713
That comes from mother. as a reminder.

705
00:59:59.263 --> 01:00:02.256
This candle was already
burning when you were baptized.

706
01:00:06.061 --> 01:00:08.178
Warm yourself up. my son.

707
01:00:30.794 --> 01:00:32.706
I'm sorry. Simeon.

708
01:00:36.008 --> 01:00:37.499
I couldn't save him.

709
01:00:46.852 --> 01:00:47.933
I forgive you.

710
01:00:50.397 --> 01:00:51.854
How could I not?

711
01:00:53.317 --> 01:00:55.104
My son is in the grave

712
01:00:56.904 --> 01:00:58.361
my daughter a prisoner.

713
01:01:02.576 --> 01:01:05.193
- Let's get the prisoners back!
- Impossible. Simeon.

714
01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:08.784
- That would be suicide.
- In an attack in the steppe

715
01:01:08.916 --> 01:01:10.828
our artillery is useless.

716
01:01:11.752 --> 01:01:14.620
The nomads only have cavalry. Simeon.

717
01:01:14.796 --> 01:01:16.833
We only infantry.

718
01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:18.672
So what should we do?

719
01:01:26.433 --> 01:01:27.719
I don't know.

720
01:01:56.004 --> 01:01:58.747
Colonel. Lieutenant Demarin has...

721
01:01:58.882 --> 01:02:01.465
What? What did Lieutenant Demarin do?

722
01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:24.939
- stop!
- Tell him to let people go!

723
01:02:25.534 --> 01:02:26.570
Bata.

724
01:02:27.744 --> 01:02:31.158
Kill him! You will die like a dog

725
01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:35.700
- But you won't experience that.
- Let her go. Onhudai.

726
01:02:35.836 --> 01:02:38.453
Your life is worth more.

727
01:02:39.172 --> 01:02:40.288
Give the command.

728
01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:45.460
Let them go.

729
01:02:45.929 --> 01:02:48.342
Let them through!

730
01:02:52.936 --> 01:02:54.598
You are a wise man. Zaisang.

731
01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:01.610
Maria!

732
01:03:04.322 --> 01:03:05.779
Go back to the fortress.

733
01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.493
How do you want to get out of here again.
you fool?

734
01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:13.780
I stay with you.

735
01:03:25.052 --> 01:03:27.260
- Ivan.
- Johan!

736
01:03:28.889 --> 01:03:32.132
Go I already have
a debt to pay him.

737
01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:33.970
Go!

738
01:03:34.686 --> 01:03:35.972
I take the knife.

739
01:03:37.147 --> 01:03:38.147
Come on!

740
01:03:38.899 --> 01:03:39.935
Calm.

741
01:03:42.944 --> 01:03:45.357
Calm! Now go.

742
01:03:54.498 --> 01:03:57.411
- Johan.
- I have to go back to the Dzungars.

743
01:04:32.786 --> 01:04:35.449
Colonel. there are people -
probably from the supply train.

744
01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:36.821
Could they escape?

745
01:05:04.943 --> 01:05:07.651
I wanted my freedom.
you promised.

746
01:05:07.946 --> 01:05:11.656
I am a man of honor.
You get your freedom.

747
01:05:12.159 --> 01:05:13.741
You can go now.

748
01:05:18.248 --> 01:05:21.241
I saw your wife. She is pretty.

749
01:05:21.585 --> 01:05:24.703
- Thanks a lot.
- I want to buy it from you.

750
01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:30.966
For this you can choose
a horse from my herd.

751
01:05:32.345 --> 01:05:35.338
Any. I kidnapped the
replenishment train

752
01:05:36.224 --> 01:05:39.388
there she was. So
she is my prisoner.

753
01:05:39.853 --> 01:05:42.140
But out of respect for you.
I want to buy it.

754
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:44.190
What is your price?

755
01:05:45.358 --> 01:05:47.190
As I said. this is not possible.

756
01:05:48.403 --> 01:05:49.484
Too stupid. my friend.

757
01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:53.864
That's not how you
talk to the great zaisang.

758
01:05:54.826 --> 01:05:57.068
- Hey. give her a go!
- What did you say?

759
01:05:57.704 --> 01:06:00.321
I'm not buying a pig in a poke.

760
01:06:05.754 --> 01:06:07.211
Come here. woman.

761
01:06:09.633 --> 01:06:11.249
Wait. here are men...

762
01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:18.468
- Undress yourself.
- Brigitte. not!

763
01:06:18.850 --> 01:06:22.184
- Brigitte. no! Brigitte!
- Silence him.

764
01:06:28.652 --> 01:06:31.690
I only promised
freedom to one of you.

765
01:06:36.409 --> 01:06:39.698
Johan.
close your eyes. I'm not dying.

766
01:06:39.871 --> 01:06:40.987
Brigitte!

767
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:45.286
I'm not dying.

768
01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:08.973
Did something go wrong?

769
01:07:51.151 --> 01:07:52.608
Where do they all come from?

770
01:08:01.244 --> 01:08:03.236
What the hell is going on there

771
01:08:04.414 --> 01:08:07.373
What's going on in your area. Onhudai?

772
01:08:08.043 --> 01:08:11.002
You have to sort this out on your own.
Inoen.

773
01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:14.038
I destroyed the Chinese army.

774
01:08:14.591 --> 01:08:17.755
You forced me to switch to your side.
north.

775
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:21.133
The troops of the Dzungar
Taishi Tserin Dondobo

776
01:08:21.264 --> 01:08:24.632
have canceled their campaign
against the Chinese empire

777
01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:30.021
and are now at Kara Fortress.
where your troops are stationed.

778
01:08:30.357 --> 01:08:34.897
- Why are you in here. Johan?
- Ask your governor Gagarin.

779
01:08:35.070 --> 01:08:38.234
- What?
- He forced me to go on the expedition.

780
01:08:38.406 --> 01:08:41.865
As soon as you reach the Dzungars.
you run over to them.

781
01:08:42.202 --> 01:08:45.616
You then hand over the
gold to their leader Zaisang.

782
01:08:46.331 --> 01:08:47.947
that I will give you

783
01:08:52.545 --> 01:08:55.834
The gold plate - it is
the reason for the war.

784
01:08:56.549 --> 01:09:01.010
Here is the gold. Hide
it so it won't be stolen.

785
01:09:01.179 --> 01:09:03.637
- What do the signs mean?
- No idea.

786
01:09:03.765 --> 01:09:05.757
I do not speak Chinese.

787
01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:11.061
How do you get this Paiza?

788
01:09:12.690 --> 01:09:16.104
I got it from a foreigner.
a deserter from the fortress.

789
01:09:16.611 --> 01:09:17.943
- The gold?
- Yes.

790
01:09:18.071 --> 01:09:22.031
Oh.
tell them you stole it from Gagarin.

791
01:09:22.283 --> 01:09:23.740
It will please you.

792
01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:28.996
Have you ever wondered why
the Paiza is in the governor's hands

793
01:09:30.458 --> 01:09:32.165
not in those of the tsar?

794
01:09:32.419 --> 01:09:35.412
He cheated on me.
He cheated on all of us.

795
01:09:35.588 --> 01:09:38.331
No. The Russians are not
at war with the Dzungars.

796
01:09:38.633 --> 01:09:40.670
What unpleasant news.

797
01:09:43.012 --> 01:09:46.050
The Russian governor
threw a bone to you.

798
01:09:47.392 --> 01:09:49.475
You choked on it

799
01:09:51.146 --> 01:09:52.887
and started a war.

800
01:09:53.064 --> 01:09:56.728
To sacrifice your troops for
the friendship of our two states.

801
01:09:57.152 --> 01:10:00.441
is a noble deed.
worthy of a true ruler.

802
01:10:01.114 --> 01:10:02.696
You saved China.

803
01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:05.024
Garrison. listen to my command!

804
01:10:06.953 --> 01:10:09.616
The hour has come to
fight for your fatherland.

805
01:10:11.124 --> 01:10:12.990
Let us do our duty.

806
01:10:13.751 --> 01:10:16.289
Whoever swore
the oath on this flag

807
01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:19.789
must stand there until death.

808
01:10:20.425 --> 01:10:24.260
Russia will be happy with us.
Let us stand up for our homeland

809
01:10:24.387 --> 01:10:25.878
for our home.

810
01:10:29.601 --> 01:10:32.844
I have to give this letter
of thanks to Tsar Peter.

811
01:10:34.689 --> 01:10:37.432
If this is true.
the tsar must know about it.

812
01:10:38.234 --> 01:10:42.148
The state cannot be based on
lies. We have to stop the war.

813
01:10:42.697 --> 01:10:43.697
And how?

814
01:10:54.584 --> 01:10:57.167
Hey Russian. get out with you!

815
01:10:57.295 --> 01:10:58.957
We have something for you.

816
01:11:12.227 --> 01:11:15.561
Why did you come to our country.
Russian?

817
01:11:16.147 --> 01:11:19.481
The Tsar asked us to
travel to the city of Yerkend

818
01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:21.350
and look for gold there.

819
01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:27.606
We don't want to fight.

820
01:11:27.992 --> 01:11:34.330
I personally heard the
Tsar's order not to start a war.

821
01:11:40.213 --> 01:11:41.624
We come in peace.

822
01:11:52.976 --> 01:11:54.137
Die.

823
01:12:03.027 --> 01:12:04.689
Die. Russian.

824
01:12:13.371 --> 01:12:15.909
Do you like that. Russian. hmm?

825
01:12:17.041 --> 01:12:18.202
Enough!

826
01:12:28.636 --> 01:12:34.132
I let you go. Nobody
needs this war.

827
01:12:35.518 --> 01:12:36.679
Release him.

828
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:40.729
My request to the Russians
is to leave the fortress

829
01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:42.849
and go home.

830
01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:46.356
What are you doing. Nuen?

831
01:12:48.406 --> 01:12:49.738
I believe him.

832
01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:54.784
If you agree to the peace offer.

833
01:12:55.496 --> 01:12:58.113
fires a cannon once.

834
01:13:08.593 --> 01:13:12.507
A mediator! There comes a mediator.
brothers!

835
01:13:15.058 --> 01:13:19.803
This is not just any mediator.
it is Ivan Demarin. Ivan!

836
01:13:20.271 --> 01:13:23.514
Ivan Demarin! Come over. greet him!

837
01:13:23.650 --> 01:13:26.267
Come on. let's line up.

838
01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:30.695
Ivan! Ivan is here!

839
01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:39.530
Lieutenant Demarin. vivat!

840
01:13:40.583 --> 01:13:41.583
Ivan!

841
01:13:48.758 --> 01:13:50.795
You look bad. brother.

842
01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:06.352
That hurts?

843
01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:09.859
No. not anymore.

844
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:22.531
Welcome back. Ivan Danilovich.

845
01:14:23.543 --> 01:14:24.624
Welcome back.

846
01:14:26.546 --> 01:14:28.583
Welcome back. you hero.

847
01:14:29.716 --> 01:14:33.005
Colonel.
I know how to stop the war.

848
01:14:41.477 --> 01:14:44.686
You pull out. And so do we.

849
01:14:46.399 --> 01:14:47.399
Stop!

850
01:14:49.444 --> 01:14:50.980
This is your fault.

851
01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:58.781
And remember. don't even come
close to the Russian Khanate.

852
01:15:00.705 --> 01:15:03.413
Never look me under the eyes again.

853
01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:08.665
Then you will keep your life.

854
01:15:27.315 --> 01:15:30.103
Thank god they are leaving.

855
01:15:33.654 --> 01:15:37.364
Remove the cannons from the bulwarks.
the mission is over.

856
01:15:37.492 --> 01:15:42.078
- We go home!
- Where are you? Come here.

857
01:15:48.961 --> 01:15:52.295
Hey Do you want your wife back?

858
01:15:54.133 --> 01:15:56.625
I will then release you with my wife.

859
01:15:58.679 --> 01:16:01.046
What do you want from me. Zaisang?

860
01:16:01.265 --> 01:16:04.383
Not much. You should only
shoot the gate of my riders.

861
01:16:07.688 --> 01:16:10.681
Tserin Dondobo has forbidden
us to fight the Russians.

862
01:16:11.108 --> 01:16:12.474
I have to take revenge.

863
01:16:12.610 --> 01:16:15.569
Aren't you a good shooter or
are you afraid of the Russians?

864
01:16:16.197 --> 01:16:19.281
And did you forget how to shoot?

865
01:16:21.369 --> 01:16:24.487
You lied to me.
you are not a shooter.

866
01:16:24.664 --> 01:16:26.621
You can't fire a cannon at all.

867
01:16:28.376 --> 01:16:30.743
No. you just want to put me back in.

868
01:16:32.046 --> 01:16:36.131
I swear. If you want.
you can already have my wife.

869
01:16:39.345 --> 01:16:41.257
I don't like it anymore.

870
01:16:42.181 --> 01:16:43.181
Agreed?

871
01:16:53.276 --> 01:16:55.108
Brigitte. Brigitte. come on.

872
01:17:00.658 --> 01:17:01.944

But you should still know
what you're going to die for.

945

No. no longer a lieutenant. From

- In the service of the fatherland.
- Nice to see you. babbler.

986
01:37:12.702 --> 01:37:16.537
- But there is no war there.
- And that's how it should stay forever.

987

I dream that there is no
more war. Understand that.

988
01:37:26.299 --> 01:37:31.715
The state is strong thanks to our victims.

989

Not for ourselves. but for others

990
01:37:36.893 --> 01:37:38.850
and for our fatherland.

991
01:37:39.687 --> 01:37:43.977
As long as the Russian
state has people like you

992
01:37:44.984 --> 01:37:47.101
he will live and thrive

I never thought of that.
Peter Alexeyevich.

Send me to a monastery.

1007
