in holy matrimony. speak now
or forever hold your peace.

23
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.323

24
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.660
- And who might you be. sir?

25
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.840
- Beth's husband in the eyes of God.

26
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.120
- Michael. why are you doing this?

27
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.440
- Buzz off. loser.

28
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.690
- You do follow the Bible.
don't you. minister?

29
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.100
- Of course.

30
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.920
The Bible is our sole authority.

31
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.840
- Then you know that the
Bible says that a believer

32
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.950
can't divorce another believer
and then marry someone else

33
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.070
and she's married to a believer. me.

34
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.360
- Are you a Catholic?

35
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.503
- Yeah. so?

36
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.490
- You pagan. heathen Catholics
aren't real Christians.

37
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.440
- Oh. horsepooey. we are so.

38
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.360

46
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.670
- You're on your own. weedhopper.

47
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.860
- Who cares. it's an open bar.

48
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.423

- Will you be careful?

66
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.580
This could be worth a lot of
money someday. if it survives.

67
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.370
- Then put it somewhere
where I won't trip over it.

68
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.790
The living room is an
artistic obstacle course.

69
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:12.940
- It's great. isn't it?

70
00:04:13.941 --> 00:04:14.774
Ooh.

00:04:25.615 --> 00:04:28.142

00:04:28.142 --> 00:04:29.225

00:04:58.632 --> 00:05:00.682
I thought the house next door was vacant.

77
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.970
- [David] Must be critters.

78
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.340
- With flashlights?

79
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.340
- [David] Swamp gas.

80
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.563
- You're not even paying attention. look.

81
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.140
- You're right. there's some lights.

82
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.250
Should I call the cops?

83
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.083
- No.

84
00:05:25.245 --> 00:05:27.000
I don't wanna sound foolish.

85
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.833
- Too late.

86
00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.153
Wanna play spaceman?

87
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.020
- [Beth] Oh. now you wanna play spaceman?

88
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.760
- Anything to get out of these masks.

89
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.200
- Did you take the trash can

90
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.810
and the recycling out to the street?

91
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.700
- Yes. princess.

92
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.560
Is that a point for me?

93
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.573
- [Beth] Offsetting. back to zero.

94
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.273
Rub my back and maybe we'll see.

00:05:55.718 --> 00:05:58.385

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.610
- Hi.

99
00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.804
Can we talk for a minute. please?

100
00:06:32.804 --> 00:06:33.637
Beth.

101
00:06:35.362 --> 00:06:37.389
Beth.

102
00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:40.802
If you don't come out here.
I'm gonna strangle this dog.

103
00:06:40.802 --> 00:06:43.553
(imitating dog struggle)

104
00:06:43.553 --> 00:06:44.386
Ow!

105
00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:46.683
- We don't have a dog.

106
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.220
- Well. you just saved his life.

107
00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.213
- Nice car.

108
00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.720
- Yeah. I'm leaving it to you.

109
00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.290
- Oh good. I'll trade it
for a villa in Tuscany.

110
00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:59.400
What do you want?

111
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.283
- I'm just getting my house in order.

112
00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.160
- Are you going somewhere?

113
00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:05.993
- Maybe.

114
00:07:05.993 --> 00:07:08.550
- Good. then maybe you'll
finally leave us alone.

115
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:10.650
- And then you can
contract a legal marriage

116
00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:11.483
with the Church.

117
00:07:11.483 --> 00:07:13.140
- You just won't let that die. will you?

118
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:18.090
- No. but before I head off
to that big island resort

119
00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:20.283
in the sky. just tell me one thing.

120
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.470
Why did you leave me?

121
00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.300
- Oh. I've told you a thousand times.

122
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.680
You know very well why.

123
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.113
- Beth. as God as my
witness. I don't know why.

124
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:33.000
- Last I checked. they still
don't let cheaters into heaven.

125
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.833
- What?

126
00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:36.765
I never cheated on you.

127
00:07:36.765 --> 00:07:38.160
- Sure you did with that bimbo buyer.

128
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.300
- Bimbo buyer?

129
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.400
- The one you met at the base.

130
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.980
- Wait a minute. you mean
that purchasing agent

131
00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.450
at the air base?

132
00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:48.150
It was David having the affair with her.

133
00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.250
Then when I wouldn't lie
for him and his girlfriend

134
00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:51.690
at the time found out and dumped him.

135
00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.150
he said I'd violated the guy code.

136
00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:55.590
but he still got what he wanted.

137
00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:58.470
That bimbo. I mean purchasing agent.

138
00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:01.140
let him put his name on our bid.

139
00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.570
then she awarded it to him personally.

140
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.510
After that. he go it alone
and didn't need me anymore.

141
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:07.350
- You're lying.

142
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.330
- Oh yeah. I just made that up.

143
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:10.380
But that's not all.

144
00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:13.143
The agent got caught and
David rolled over on her.

145
00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.780
Pardon the pun.

146
00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.380
Then she went to jail while
David was never prosecuted.

147
00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:23.013
Then he stole you. the big prize.

148
00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:27.120
- Why couldn't you tell
me all this years ago?

149
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.023
- I couldn't.

150
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.070
- Even if you weren't lying and you are.

151
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:34.710
you didn't have to hassle
and harangue us forever

152
00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.473
and we could have dispelled this years ago

153
00:08:36.473 --> 00:08:39.273
and you wouldn't have had
to make my life miserable.

154
00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:45.360
- Has anyone in the world
ever been happy to see you?

155
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.833
- He's all yours. David.

156
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:49.140
- What do you want?

157
00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:50.973
- The same thing I always want.

158
00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.543
for my wife's soul to be safe and holy.

159
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.490
- Holy matrimony. Batman. what a surprise.

160
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.130
Pow.
- Yeah. easy killer.

161
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:04.740
But just think. if I wasn't around.

162
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:05.910
you could marry her in the Church

163
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.970
and maybe become a Catholic yourself.

164
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:12.060
- The only way that I would
ever become a Catholic

165
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.610
is if Jesus Christ himself came down.

166
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.580
knocked on my door and
said. "Oh. I want you."

167
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.520
- By the time He came back.
it'd be too late for ya.

168
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:25.520
- Okay then. if the Pope asks
me. then I'll become Catholic.

169
00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:28.320
Yeah. the Pope. that's a ticket.

170
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.273
Tell him drop in anytime.

171
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:40.323
- Well. at least you still love me.

172
00:09:43.718 --> 00:09:46.385
(serious music)

173
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:51.700
- [Beth] Did you steal the company?

174
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:55.800
- [David] I had to take over.

175
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.900
He destroyed the company's integrity.

176
00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.310
It was a matter of survival.

177
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:00.930
- [Beth] And what about me?

178
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.580
- [David] Someone's gonna
take care of you. so I did.

179
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:06.831
- David Paul Sheba. if you are lying.

180
00:10:06.831 --> 00:10:07.998
- [David] Shh.

181
00:10:09.007 --> 00:10:11.507
(David claps)

182
00:10:16.421 --> 00:10:19.004
(solemn music)

183
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:24.273
- David. how come we never pray together?

184
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.333
- Pray?

185
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.470
You knew I wasn't a praying
man when you married me.

186
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.553
- Well.

187
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.090
at least you weren't praying
with me at the same time

188
00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:40.290
you were cheating on me.

189
00:10:51.518 --> 00:10:54.018
(grand music)

190
00:11:10.445 --> 00:11:12.028
- Please. sit. sit.

191
00:11:13.023 --> 00:11:16.113
I am so happy and blessed
to see you all here today.

192
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.810
There are so many people
from different countries

193
00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:25.560
here in Cleveland for the World Youth Day.

194
00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:30.240
It is an amazing sign of
unity to see all the people

195
00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.630
of different sizes and shapes and colors

196
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:37.590
sharing our beloved Catholic
faith with each other.

197
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:42.590
It is. it is like a little bit of heaven

198
00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:44.880
right here on the lake.

199
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.320
- Tell us. Your Holiness.

200
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.046
how does it feel being
the first African Pope?

201
00:11:50.046 --> 00:11:51.323
- Well. I would not know.

202
00:11:51.323 --> 00:11:53.906
(all laughing)

203
00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:00.690
That happened in the first
century of the Church.

204
00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:04.353
I am the fourth African Pope.

205
00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:09.600
In the first 300 years of the Church.

206
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:14.600
each Pope was guaranteed to
be martyred for the faith.

207
00:12:16.033 --> 00:12:19.836
I do not think that the pool
of applicants was very large.

208
00:12:19.836 --> 00:12:21.750
(press laughing)

209
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:26.010
It used to be that when people
wanted to state the obvious.

210
00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:28.767
they would say. "Is the Pope Catholic?"

211
00:12:30.903 --> 00:12:32.423
It's okay. you can laugh.

212
00:12:32.423 --> 00:12:33.570
(press laughing)

213
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:38.097
And many years later. it
became. "Is the Pope Polish?"

214
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.060
Still. it's okay. you can laugh.

215
00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.213
(press laughing)

216
00:12:42.213 --> 00:12:46.380
Then sent John Paul II effectively

217
00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:49.143
killed off all Polish Popes.

218
00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:51.293
Why?

219
00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:58.280
How many Poles does it take
to defeat the Soviet Union?

220
00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:00.473
Anyone?

221
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:02.647
No one?

222
00:13:06.246 --> 00:13:07.079
Just one.

223
00:13:07.079 --> 00:13:09.183
(press laughing)

224
00:13:09.183 --> 00:13:12.850
Now the latest joke is.
"Is the Pope Black?"

225
00:13:14.096 --> 00:13:17.400
(press laughing)

226
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.233
Yes.

227
00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:21.630
Do you know any good ones?

228
00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:26.630
- It's been a long trip and the
Holy Father is a very tired.

229
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.330
Tomorrow he will be at
various World Youth Day venues

230
00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.910
to smell the sheep. as it were.

231
00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:34.290
And then two days from now.

232
00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:37.140
the Pope will celebrate
a large outdoor Mass

233
00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:38.610
at Lakefront Airport.

234
00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.250
We're expecting more than 2
million people for the Mass.

235
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.800
I understand that's more
than when the Calves

236
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.706
won the NBA Championship in 2016.

237
00:13:46.706 --> 00:13:47.539
(all laughing)

238
00:13:47.539 --> 00:13:48.372
- That's right.

239
00:13:48.372 --> 00:13:50.620
If it's big. it's happening in Cleveland.

240
00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:51.900
(all laughing)

241
00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.403
Eat your hear out. Cincinnati.

242
00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:57.810
- You got any threes?

243
00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:59.410
- No. Cardinal Cariott. go fish.

244
00:14:01.212 --> 00:14:02.583
- Oh. ha!

245
00:14:03.587 --> 00:14:07.050
- A bishop and do you have any trays?

246
00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:07.883
- What's a tray?

247
00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.220
(clergy laughing)

248
00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:12.480
- Threes.

249
00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.733
- Oh. well then. no.

250
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:24.920
- Monsignor. do you have any sixes?

251
00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:26.723
Hmm. do you?

252
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:29.433
- Oh. Monsignor.

253
00:14:32.053 --> 00:14:32.886
- I have.

254
00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:38.790
(clergy gasping)

255
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:40.683
- No worries.

256
00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.060
- Oh.

257
00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:48.930
Wouldn't it be great if Revelation
had a key to the numbers?

258
00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:50.610
- Come. on play.

259
00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:52.556
Cariott's losing again.

260
00:14:52.556 --> 00:14:54.655
(clergy laughing)

261
00:14:54.655 --> 00:14:56.340
- What?
- He always loses. always.

262
00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.770
- It's terrible. it's the easiest game.

263
00:14:58.770 --> 00:14:59.770
- I win at swimming.

264
00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:03.540
- [Pope] When was the last
time you went swimming?

265
00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.610
- I'm a master backstroker.

266
00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:06.450
- Yes.

267
00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:07.890
- You're going to go out to the Lake Erie

268
00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:09.450
and do a little bit of
that while we're in town.

269
00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.010
- I float very well.

270
00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:12.420
- That's wonderful.

271
00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:14.463
I can stay floating for hours.

272
00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:18.231
I'm like a upside down whale.

273
00:15:18.231 --> 00:15:21.064
(clergy laughing)

274
00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:27.840
- Dear Lord. I know this World Youth Day

275
00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.733
was scheduled before I was elected.

276
00:15:33.658 --> 00:15:35.825
but why did You choose me?

277
00:15:37.577 --> 00:15:40.233
I am no good at this glad-handy.

278
00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:45.570
I don't even know why you made
me a bishop and a cardinal.

279
00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:46.743
let alone the Pope.

280
00:15:48.694 --> 00:15:52.690
I fear that I will be a lousy shepherd

281
00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:56.583
and the wolves will ravage Your flock.

282
00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:00.803
Please.

283
00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:04.863
take this cup from me.

284
00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:09.783
even if it means I have to die.

285
00:16:12.137 --> 00:16:14.720
(somber music)

286
00:16:28.116 --> 00:16:31.500
(bright music)

287
00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.693
- Commence Operation Pope Drops In.

288
00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.308
Showtime.

289
00:16:38.308 --> 00:16:40.891
(bright music)

290
00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:46.763
- [Pope] Coffee.

291
00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.033
- Coffee.

292
00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.800
They don't have any coffee inside?

293
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.280
- Describing what they
have in there as coffee

294
00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:08.172
would be a sin against
the eighth commandment.

295
00:17:08.172 --> 00:17:10.607
(both laughing)

296
00:17:10.607 --> 00:17:12.810
- I like this car.

297
00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:14.190
It's a nice color.

298
00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:17.160
- I got stuck with a
whole fleet of these Fiats

299
00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:21.180
because my predecessor did not
want to offend the Italians.

300
00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:26.010
so I had them painted Church colors.

301
00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:31.010
Mary Blue. Martha Red. Ordinary
Green and Latarra Pink.

302
00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:34.460
- Latarra Pink.

303
00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:37.700
- Yes. we only take those out
a couple of Sundays a year.

304
00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.020
(both laughing)

305
00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.303
- What. no Prince of Peace Purple?

306
00:17:43.359 --> 00:17:46.637
- No. apparently some rock star's estate

307
00:17:46.637 --> 00:17:48.554
owns everything purple.

308
00:17:49.564 --> 00:17:50.427
- Oh.

309
00:17:50.427 --> 00:17:53.600
(Pope laughing)

310
00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:54.433
- Coffee?

311
00:17:58.237 --> 00:18:01.070
(uplifting music)

312
00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:23.883
- Can I ask you a special favor?

313
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:29.340
- Go on. my son.

314
00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.170
- I need you to go with
me to visit someone

315
00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:33.663
who needs to come back to the faith.

316
00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.900
- I don't think I have time.

317
00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.480
- Not have time to save a soul?

318
00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.330
- You know. I have many commitments.

319
00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:44.673
- I do. and I only have one.

320
00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:47.733
but it's a very important one.

321
00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:51.573
In fact. there's none
more important than this.

322
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:54.513
- And if I won't go?

323
00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:59.310
- Then I will have to insist.

324
00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:04.310
- So. you are kidnapping me. eh?

325
00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.723
- If that's what you wanna call it.

326
00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.873
- Know you can go to jail for this?

327
00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:21.870
- You know when Jesus says
to Peter. "When you are old.

328
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:24.870
you will stretch out your
hands and others will dress you

329
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:26.310
and take you where you don't want to go"?

330
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:30.030
- Yes. I know the passage.

331
00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:33.513
- Well. now is that time. Peter.

332
00:19:33.513 --> 00:19:35.250
(Pope laughing)

333
00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:37.470
- I don't think this particular time

334
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:38.790
is what he was referring to.

335
00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:41.103
- Probably not. but it'll have to do.

336
00:19:51.998 --> 00:19:55.980
(quiet dramatic music)

337
00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:56.887
- Is that gun?

338
00:19:59.403 --> 00:20:00.813
- It's my finger.

339
00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:11.670
- Did you cry at the end
of "Field of Dreams?"

340
00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:13.233
- Yeah. of course.

341
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.333
- Me too.

342
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:23.133
All right. how long will this take?

343
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:26.176
- They'll hardly miss you.

344
00:20:26.176 --> 00:20:27.744
(Pope laughing)

345
00:20:27.744 --> 00:20:30.327
(bright music)

346
00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:40.760
- [Spiro] Here you go.

347
00:20:43.013 --> 00:20:44.640
- Who are you?

348
00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.473
- Spiro.

349
00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.583
- I am the Pope.

350
00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:49.893
- I know who you are.

351
00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.880
Nice color. this car. Mary Blue.

352
00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:57.570
We're riding in Mary's
Fiat. how appropriate.

353
00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:59.727
- How old are you?

354
00:20:59.727 --> 00:21:01.593
- Old enough to go on an adventure.

355
00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.410
- I am sure this violates

356
00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:07.440
some sort of child protection protocol.

357
00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.760
- No. it doesn't.

358
00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.740
Let the little children come to me.

359
00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:12.780
Kids need adults around.

360
00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:14.970
So where are we headed. Michael?

361
00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:18.660
- South and West. Cincinnati.

362
00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:21.720
- Wait. he can't go.

363
00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.453
- Sure he can. it'll be fun.

364
00:21:25.678 --> 00:21:26.910
- Are you nuts?

365
00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:30.063
- I'm kidnapping the Pope. of course I am.

366
00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:34.800
- This better be life or death.

367
00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.100
- Oh. it's more than that.

368
00:21:37.017 --> 00:21:38.940
- So you are in cahoots.

369
00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.143
- You might say that.

370
00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:46.203
- Hey. there are only four holes.

371
00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.173
- Carrying charges.

372
00:21:51.287 --> 00:21:54.960
- Funny guy.
(Michael laughing)

373
00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:55.927
Here. you want one?

374
00:21:59.273 --> 00:22:01.690

386
00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:50.340
- Let's just get it over with.

387
00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:52.830
Who are we going to see?

388
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:55.130
- Some people you have
a natural affinity for.

389
00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:58.680
a divorced and remarried.
non-practicing Catholic

390
00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:02.013
and her not-anything spouse who
broke up her first marriage.

391
00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:07.230
- And how are you connected?

392
00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:10.473
- The guy's my ex-business
partner who stole the business.

393
00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:12.723
The woman is my wife.

394
00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:15.363
He stole her too.

395
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.600
- I don't think it's very wise for me

396
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.630
to become involved in
a domestic disturbance.

397
00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:23.760
- Oh you mean husband pummels Pope

398
00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.160
who was visiting wife. film at 11.

399
00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:26.993
- Pummel?

400
00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:30.703
I don't want to be pummeled.

401
00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:34.920
Are you sure you should be doing this?

402
00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.920
- Giving your love to
someone who betrays you

403
00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:39.543
is the story of Jesus.

404
00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:41.880
- He is right. you know.

405
00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:47.580
- So. what do you do in your spare time?

406
00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:48.918
- Spare time.

407
00:23:48.918 --> 00:23:49.751
(Pope laughing)

408
00:23:49.751 --> 00:23:52.950
You mean when I am not
being Vicar of Christ.

409
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:54.930
head of the Universal Church.

410
00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:57.720
and Servant of all servants to God?

411
00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.550
- Yeah. that.

412
00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:01.749
- Love to bowl.

413
00:24:01.749 --> 00:24:03.150
(Pope laughing)

414
00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:05.040
Play a little bowling ball.

415
00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.167
It's so exciting. I love it.

416
00:24:07.167 --> 00:24:08.700
- You know any good jokes?

417
00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:10.920
- Spiro. he's not the Church jester.

418
00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:14.360
- No. no. no. no. no.
no. he's okay. he's okay.

419
00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:16.119
Ah. everyone listening?

420
00:24:16.119 --> 00:24:17.952
Aah. okay. okay. okay.

421
00:24:19.613 --> 00:24:22.470
Why did the theologian cross the road?

422
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:24.070
- To observe the good Samaritan.

423
00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:29.463
- So you have heard this one before.

424
00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:34.890
- Okay. so why did the Good
Samaritan cross the road?

425
00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:38.400
- Ah. to help the guy who was beaten up.

426
00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.903
- Eh. wrong.

427
00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:43.060
To get away from the theologian.

428
00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:45.977
(Michael laughing)

429
00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.243
- How is that funny?

430
00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.633
- You gotta work on your standup.

431
00:24:57.030 --> 00:25:01.293
- Dying is easy. but
comedy. comedy is hard.

432
00:25:05.094 --> 00:25:06.450
The banyo. please.

433
00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:09.333
I need to go next stop. please.

434
00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:17.670
- Bishop. it appears the
Pope is headed out of town.

435
00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:20.820
Why. I don't know. and where
he's going. I can't tell.

436
00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:22.247
- How do you know that?

437
00:25:22.247 --> 00:25:27.247
- Ah. I have a new and improved
Pope tracker on my phone.

438
00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:30.750
As long as he has his smartphone
on him. we can find him.

439
00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:32.670
Now then. do you have any men

440
00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:35.280
you can put on this. tough ones?

441
00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.113
- Let me think.

442
00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.953
Well. there's always
the Kamaraza brothers.

443
00:25:39.953 --> 00:25:41.580
- The the Karamaza brothers.

444
00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:43.200
- No. the Kamaraza brothers.

445
00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.555
- That's what I said. Karamaza brothers.

446
00:25:45.555 --> 00:25:50.523
The K brothers. but can you
assure me. are they discreet?

447
00:25:51.533 --> 00:25:54.783
(Sicilian Mafia music)

448
00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:01.740
- My name is Dimitri
Leoni Disputin Kamarazo.

449
00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:05.613
This is my brother. Alioso
Theodore Pavlonavich Kamarazo.

450
00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:08.243
We call him Vepos.

451
00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:11.343
- Gentlemen. sit.

452
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:17.770
Make yourself comfortable.

453
00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.250
Now then. I have a mission for you.

454
00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:26.010
It is nothing less than saving the Church.

455
00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:28.353
I need you to find the Pope.

456
00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:30.660
- The Pope is missing?

457
00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:33.329
- Either that or he has been kidnapped.

458
00:26:33.329 --> 00:26:36.020
(Vepos gasping)

459
00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.637
- We will find him. Your Eminence.

460
00:26:37.637 --> 00:26:40.170
and we will bring him back safely.

461
00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:41.686
- I swear.

462
00:26:41.686 --> 00:26:44.010
- Do not swear. we are in mixed company.

463
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.210
- Sorry.

464
00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:48.270
- Gentlemen. allow me
to confer for a moment

465
00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:51.040
with Monsignor Riacco.

466
00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:55.770
Okay. so Monsignor. I was going
to pay these two yodel heads

467
00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:57.840
to make sure the Pope never returned.

468
00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:00.810
but now I think they are more
likely to accomplish that

469
00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:02.790
by trying to save him.

470
00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:03.623
What do you think?

471
00:27:03.623 --> 00:27:06.630
- Right. we can send
them on a perilous quest

472
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:09.210
wherein they will die.
along with the Pope.

473
00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:12.420
and then you'll be a
shoo-in to be the Pope

474
00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:14.698
at the next conclave.

475
00:27:14.698 --> 00:27:16.557
- They know we're here. right?

476
00:27:16.557 --> 00:27:18.653
- They understand we
are two feet from them.

477
00:27:20.873 --> 00:27:21.927
I'm sure they know that they are doing.

478
00:27:21.927 --> 00:27:23.408
- I'm sure.

479
00:27:23.408 --> 00:27:24.750
- They're a very organized religion.

480
00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:25.583
- This is very true.

481
00:27:25.583 --> 00:27:26.670
- What shall we have them do?

482
00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:28.230
Zip lining with loose connections?

483
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:29.400
- Too obvious.

484
00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.960
- Bungee jumping with too long of a cord.

485
00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.100
- Too much fun.

486
00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:35.100
- Sabotage the tire swing over the lake.

487
00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:37.560
- We're not sending him to summer camp.

488
00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.643
- Look at their face.

489
00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:47.513
- Sorry.

490
00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:52.470
We could tell them that
he needs to survive

491
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:54.903
a snake bite in his sleep.

492
00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.810
And then we let them have one

493
00:27:57.810 --> 00:27:59.790
that they let loose in the room.

494
00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:01.980
It's very biblical. very Sherlock.

495
00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:04.633
- Too Pentecostal.

496
00:28:04.633 --> 00:28:06.330
(growling) What's his kryptonite?

497
00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:09.120
We cart. ooh. we could make
him run 'till he drops.

498
00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.020
- For what reason?

499
00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:10.853
- You're right.

500
00:28:16.275 --> 00:28:18.330
- (gasping) Wait a minute.

501
00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:20.414
He's got seasonal allergies.

502
00:28:20.414 --> 00:28:21.247
- So?

503
00:28:21.247 --> 00:28:24.090
- So we tell the boys
he has to be locked away

504
00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:27.171
in the dungeon of a
castle until he completes

505
00:28:27.171 --> 00:28:30.990
substitutional penance for all
the scandals of the Church.

506
00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:32.280
And no one can interrupt him

507
00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.130
or he has to start all over again.

508
00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:39.300
one day for every bad priest
in the last 100 years.

509
00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:40.580
- What will that do?

510
00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:41.413
He'll like that.

511
00:28:41.413 --> 00:28:42.246
- No food.

512
00:28:42.246 --> 00:28:47.246
We tell these honyocks only
angels can come and feed him.

513
00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:50.070
They'll lock him away 'till nobody's there

514
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:53.915
and that moldy old castle
will kill him in no time.

515
00:28:53.915 --> 00:28:55.560
- Brilliant.
- I know.

516
00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:56.960
- Now we just need a castle.

517
00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.433
Let's search. castles near me.

518
00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:05.490
Ah. here we are.
- Huh.

519
00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:09.240
- White Castle.

520
00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:11.610
Oh. that's not right.

521
00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:13.980
That's a chain that sells onion burgers.

522
00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:16.170
- Burgers.
- No. onion burgers.

523
00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:18.993
We're trying to starve him
to death. not torture him.

524
00:29:20.579 --> 00:29:21.412
- Me know castle.

525
00:29:21.412 --> 00:29:22.323
- It is in Loveland.

526
00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:29.460
- Gentlemen. you're about
to embark on a quest.

527
00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:33.000
You need to capture the
Pope and take him to the...

528
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.233
- White Castle.

529
00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:37.670
- The one you said.

530
00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:41.373
- Loveland.
- Loveland. the castle.

531
00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:46.320
And have him do penance
for the Universal Church.

532
00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:50.070
It's tough love. my brothers. tough love.

533
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:53.160
The future of the Church depends on you.

534
00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.410
Here. take this phone.

535
00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:57.780
It's set to track the Pope's location.

536
00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:01.350
And gentlemen. I gave up anger for Lent.

537
00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:03.720
so don't piss me off.

538
00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:04.743
- Aye aye. sir.

539
00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:07.081
- You have no problem.

540
00:30:07.081 --> 00:30:08.037
(all laughing)

541
00:30:08.037 --> 00:30:09.753
- Yes. now you understand.

542
00:30:11.019 --> 00:30:12.077
Fine.

543
00:30:12.077 --> 00:30:12.994
Good. good.

544
00:30:15.325 --> 00:30:17.379
- We will do fine.
- We'll do fine.

545
00:30:17.379 --> 00:30:20.737
We have to do this.
- You have to leave.

546
00:30:20.737 --> 00:30:23.184
- Must find. find Pope.

547
00:30:23.184 --> 00:30:25.893
(brothers chatting)

548
00:30:25.893 --> 00:30:26.726
- Get out!

549
00:30:27.936 --> 00:30:28.769
Leave!

550
00:30:29.821 --> 00:30:32.026
- Go. nice to meet you.
- Bye-bye.

551
00:30:32.026 --> 00:30:33.026
- Au revoir.

552
00:30:34.099 --> 00:30:36.599
- They are very nice. I think.

553
00:30:38.573 --> 00:30:39.900
- Do you think it will work?

554
00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:43.083
- Let's just say my miter size is a 7 1/2.

555
00:30:45.205 --> 00:30:47.872
(both laughing)

556
00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:59.133
- Hello. Mary.

557
00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:06.330
- Welcome. would you like
to try a tasting flight?

558
00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:07.656
- Sure.

559
00:31:07.656 --> 00:31:08.550
(sommelier laughing)

560
00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:10.293
- Not for me. I'm driving.

561
00:31:11.127 --> 00:31:13.466
But how about a glass
of wine for our friend?

562
00:31:13.466 --> 00:31:15.338
- Okay.
- And I'll take a grape juice.

563
00:31:15.338 --> 00:31:16.590
- All right.

564
00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:19.080
- In that case I'll have what he's having.

565
00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:22.863
- Oh. wine for your friend
and grape juice for you.

566
00:31:24.958 --> 00:31:27.573
You know. your friend
there looks familiar.

567
00:31:28.428 --> 00:31:31.623
- Oh yeah. lots of people
say he looks like the Pope.

568
00:31:32.703 --> 00:31:34.873
- No. that's not it.

569
00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:48.180
- We ordered you a glass of wine.

570
00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:51.983
- Thank you.

571
00:31:55.094 --> 00:31:56.603
Blood of the Grape.

572
00:31:56.603 --> 00:31:59.010
What is the significance of that name?

573
00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:01.290
- My late husband and I
thought it would be an honor

574
00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:03.360
to make the wine that
turns into the actual blood

575
00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:06.450
of Christ at Mass. so
the blood of the grape

576
00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:08.223
becomes the blood of the Lamb.

577
00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:10.713
- Good for you.

578
00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:13.680
May I purchase a case?

579
00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:17.430
- This is all I have left
of the sacramental wine.

580
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:20.433
We had Jesuits in last week
and they cleaned me out.

581
00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.553
- Well. let's just hope they
don't turn it back into water.

582
00:32:23.553 --> 00:32:26.034
(all laughing)

583
00:32:26.034 --> 00:32:27.542
(dramatic music)

584
00:32:27.542 --> 00:32:29.253
- Nobody move.

585
00:32:30.455 --> 00:32:33.705
(Sicilian Mafia music)

586
00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:39.893
Good.

587
00:32:42.012 --> 00:32:44.845
(glasses banging)

588
00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:46.660
- Follow my lead.

589
00:32:47.758 --> 00:32:50.508
(dramatic music)

590
00:33:04.355 --> 00:33:05.580
- Squirrel!

591
00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:08.673
- Oh. I love squirrel.

592
00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:11.643
What is squirrel?

593
00:33:12.896 --> 00:33:14.549
Oh. where'd they go?

594
00:33:14.549 --> 00:33:17.049
(chase music)

595
00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:45.033
- Oh!

596
00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:49.650
- Don't mess with the
Mike. wherever you are.

597
00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:50.500
- And you're out!

598
00:33:53.448 --> 00:33:56.781
(chase music continues)

599
00:33:59.898 --> 00:34:01.932
(shovel bangs)

600
00:34:01.932 --> 00:34:04.349
(body thuds)

601
00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:17.950
Nice shot. but let's see
what the judges have to say.

602
00:34:19.592 --> 00:34:21.243
It was just war theory.

603
00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:26.253
Proportional response.

604
00:34:30.759 --> 00:34:31.842
Self-defense.

605
00:34:36.392 --> 00:34:37.410
- Okay.

606
00:34:37.410 --> 00:34:40.152
The judges will accept that.
- The judges will accept that.

607
00:34:40.152 --> 00:34:43.679
- Good. now let's get out of here.

608
00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:46.262
(bright music)

609
00:34:55.563 --> 00:34:56.480
- The wine!

610
00:34:58.735 --> 00:34:59.985
- Hurry. hurry!

611
00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:07.590
- [Michael] Come on. come
on. come on. come on. hurry.

612
00:35:22.515 --> 00:35:25.015
(car revving)

613
00:35:26.437 --> 00:35:28.207
- [Pope] Bless you. my son.

614
00:35:28.207 --> 00:35:31.289
(tires squealing)

615
00:35:31.289 --> 00:35:33.789
(chase music)

616
00:35:38.583 --> 00:35:41.083
(car revving)

617
00:35:44.523 --> 00:35:48.533
- Stop!
(tires screeching)

618
00:35:48.533 --> 00:35:51.450
(brothers panting)

619
00:35:57.918 --> 00:35:58.883
Get in.

620
00:35:58.883 --> 00:36:01.003
- What are you doing?
- All right.

621
00:36:01.003 --> 00:36:02.760
I always stop for hitchhikers.

622
00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:03.960
- And he gives them 20s.

623
00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:09.720
- Why you think they pick up bottle guy?

624
00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:13.260
- Because he obviously
want second hostage.

625
00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:16.097
- Oh. he's very smart.

626
00:36:16.097 --> 00:36:19.552
Oh. you're very smart.

627
00:36:19.552 --> 00:36:22.552
(brothers groaning)

628
00:36:24.765 --> 00:36:28.020
My calf. my leg. my back leg is hurt.

629
00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:29.673
I get Charles horse.

630
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:33.933
- Hi. I'm Jesse.

631
00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.683
- This is Michael and that's Papa.

632
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:39.990
- The real thing.

633
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:41.793
- Yep. but nobody believes it.

634
00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:46.080
- Well. he doesn't seem very Pope-ish.

635
00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.270
- He's a little timid yet.
but we're working on it.

636
00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:50.430
- Hey guys. I am right here.

637
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:53.460
- See. he's just getting
better at asserting himself.

638
00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:54.660
Just give him some time.

639
00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:58.294
- Oh. this trip will be good for him.

640
00:36:58.294 --> 00:37:00.530
- Hey. no touching. no touching.

641
00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:01.880
What are you guys. shrinks?

642
00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:04.500
- Testy.

643
00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.066
So what's the mission?

644
00:37:06.066 --> 00:37:09.274
- Tell him. Papa.

645
00:37:09.274 --> 00:37:10.560
- You can tell him.

646
00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:13.503
- I can't even believe
that I am doing this.

647
00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:18.030
Okay. so. Michael is
trying to save his wife

648
00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:20.430
who divorced him and married
his ex-business partner

649
00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:23.700
who stole the company and
his wife some 20 years ago.

650
00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:26.310
Why? Because Michael would not
lie for him to his girlfriend

651
00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:28.560
about his infidelities many years before.

652
00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:31.530
Now this same said ex-business
partner has told Michael

653
00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:33.750
that he will become a
Christian and join the Church

654
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:36.630
only if the Pope drops
in and ask him personally

655
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:39.450
and we are on our way to
Cincinnati to do just that.

656
00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:40.283
Clear?

657
00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:43.560
- Crystal.

658
00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:44.393
- Good.

659
00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.013
- What if David reneges?

660
00:37:48.504 --> 00:37:52.143
- How do we know his name?

661
00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:59.700
- I wouldn't mind some
help around here sometimes.

662
00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:01.713
- I help. I make the money.

663
00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.053
- Oh sure.

664
00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:07.353
Porsche is nothing but Brutus' harlot.

665
00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:09.660
- What?

666
00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:12.390
- This isn't a business.
this is a marriage.

667
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:13.680
- Where's this coming from?

668
00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:15.780
- Do you know what day it is?

669
00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:18.120
- Seven chances and six don't count.

670
00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:19.110
- Really?

671
00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:22.227
- I know it's not "don't
hassle your husband day."

672
00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:29.813
- Nope.

673
00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:33.089
It's our anniversary.

674
00:38:33.089 --> 00:38:36.420
(somber music)

675
00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:38.970
- So tell me more about this situation

676
00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:42.120
before I go and get my head blown off.

677
00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:43.623
- You're in no danger.

678
00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:46.863
David knows the truth
even if Beth doesn't.

679
00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:50.970
- So you think this is
partially your fault?

680
00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:52.173
- Not that I know of.

681
00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.673
I loved my wife dearly.

682
00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:02.253
There's lots of innocent
spouses out there.

683
00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:07.350
Nobody's perfect. but a
marriage without forgiveness

684
00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:08.703
will always end badly.

685
00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:11.523
- Forgiveness.

686
00:39:14.669 --> 00:39:19.350
You know. the Lord says
that if we even look

687
00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:22.293
at another woman with lust in our heart.

688
00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:26.190
then we have committed adultery with her.

689
00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:29.070
- Look. I certainly appreciate
the finer attributes

690
00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:33.273
of feminine pulchritude.
but I never acted on it.

691
00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:38.340
I think she just decided
she didn't love me anymore

692
00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:39.663
and wanted out.

693
00:39:40.539 --> 00:39:42.330
- And why didn't you ask for an annulment?

694
00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:44.430
- I had no grounds.

695
00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:45.783
I kept my vow.

696
00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:49.830
Plus David's divorced.
too. so even if she asked.

697
00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:51.303
it wouldn't have been enough.

698
00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:54.570
He'd never accept Church authority.

699
00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:56.370
I'm sure he'd say he didn't need it.

700
00:39:57.529 --> 00:39:59.520
- The more you tell me
about the situation.

701
00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:01.350
the more I doubt it will do any good.

702
00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:05.970
- Perhaps. but what are you afraid of?

703
00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:07.173
- I am not afraid.

704
00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:11.310
I am being prudent.

705
00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:14.343
- No. you're being a coward.

706
00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:21.593
- Stop this car.

707
00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:24.863
Pull over.

708
00:40:26.228 --> 00:40:27.972
Pull over now.

709
00:40:27.972 --> 00:40:30.555
(somber music)

710
00:40:49.637 --> 00:40:51.693
It was a dumb idea all the way around.

711
00:40:59.010 --> 00:40:59.843
- No!

712
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:06.093
It's the same thing Jesus did for us.

713
00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:11.283
To who else can we go?

714
00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:35.753
- I said I would help and I will.

715
00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:40.790
(light music)

716
00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:46.903
Michael. I am sorry.

717
00:41:49.818 --> 00:41:52.401
(bright music)

718
00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:14.340
All this wine and running
has given me heartburn.

719
00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:16.350
- The Pope has ajathu.

720
00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:17.940
- What is that?

721
00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:19.830
- A Sicilian heartburn.

722
00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:23.493
- Oh. I get that a lot in Rome.

723
00:42:23.493 --> 00:42:26.160
(playful music)

724
00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:35.460
- Hey. I know that guy.
that's Gums and Roses.

725
00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:36.360
- Me too.
- Yeah.

726
00:42:40.112 --> 00:42:42.862
(dramatic music)

727
00:42:53.713 --> 00:42:56.100
- All right. now you go to the bathroom

728
00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:57.815
and I'll get you some antacid.

729
00:42:57.815 --> 00:43:01.042
- Yes. yes. yes. yes. yes. yes. bathroom.

730
00:43:01.042 --> 00:43:02.078
Bathroom. oh.

731
00:43:02.078 --> 00:43:03.241
- Whoa.

732
00:43:03.241 --> 00:43:04.984
Hop right in.

733
00:43:04.984 --> 00:43:07.792
Bathroom. bathroom. you stay there.

734
00:43:07.792 --> 00:43:08.625
Step here.

735
00:43:09.857 --> 00:43:12.440
(bright music)

736
00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:53.460
Think I could pass for a cowboy?

737
00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:56.700
- No partner. you're
all hat and no cattle.

738
00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:58.470
- But I have sheep.

739
00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:00.330
- That's true.

740
00:44:00.330 --> 00:44:02.280
Here. try these on.

741
00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:04.517

Cardinal.

This is Dimitri Leoni Dispuk Kamarazo.

787
00:46:49.884 --> 00:46:54.884
We are trapped in a field
on a farm with two peacocks.

788
00:46:55.952 --> 00:46:58.785
(peacocks cawing)

789
00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:01.350
- These two dead batteries

790
00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:02.910
are afraid of a couple of peacocks.

791
00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:04.260
Where are there peacocks in Ohio?

792
00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:06.300
- Your Eminence. there
are peacocks displaying

793
00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:09.600
all over Ohio. it's the mating season.

794
00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:10.800
- Dimitri.

795
00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:12.693
- Yeah. here. yes. Your Eminence.

796
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:15.811
- Dimitri!

797
00:47:15.811 --> 00:47:16.980
- Tell him something smart.

798
00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:18.540
- Dimitri!

799
00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:19.860
- Here. it's Webus.

800
00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:22.380
- Who?
- The other brother.

801
00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:24.630
- Webus. why are you in a field.

802
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:27.543
a farm in the middle of
nowhere with peacocks?

803
00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:30.540
- We had to pee.

804
00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:31.373
- Dimitri!

805
00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:33.413
Dimitri.

806
00:47:33.413 --> 00:47:34.710
- Yeah. yeah. yes.

807
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:37.260
- Drive through the birds
and catch up to the Pope.

808
00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:40.950
Dimitri. did you ever
play capture the flag?

809
00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:42.090
- Well. yes. just last week.

810
00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:43.950
- Well. this is capture the Pope.

811
00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:45.528
Now get moving.

812
00:47:45.528 --> 00:47:48.361
(peacocks cawing)

813
00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:11.280
- So why doesn't the
Church put its full weight

814
00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:12.903
behind making divorce illegal?

815
00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:16.950
- That is absurd.

816
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:19.080
No country would pass it.

817
00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:21.120
- Well. not with that attitude.

818
00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:24.483
- That is temporal. we are spiritual.

819
00:48:25.513 --> 00:48:28.170
It is not our job to politic.

820
00:48:28.170 --> 00:48:31.533
- Unless the temporal is
destroying the spiritual.

821
00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:34.440
Unless you show some fortitude.

822
00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:37.260
there'll be no one to hide
our priests in their basement

823
00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:38.610
when the persecution comes.

824
00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:41.220
- You're being a little bit
dramatic. don't you think?

825
00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:42.663
- Well. just think about it.

826
00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:46.743
- All right. I will.

827
00:48:48.653 --> 00:48:51.150
Now. can we stop?

828
00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:53.820
- Fine. no more discussion.

829
00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:55.950
- Oh. no. no. no. no. no.

830
00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:56.913
I have to go again.

831
00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:59.400
- Oh. okay.

832
00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:00.900
- Yes.

833
00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:02.160
- We're almost there.

834
00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:03.536
- Good.

835
00:49:03.536 --> 00:49:06.060
(grand music)

836
00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:09.840
- I'll be in the gift shop
looking for a ball and chain.

837
00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:11.240
- I will be in the bathroom.

838
00:49:12.679 --> 00:49:15.429
(dramatic music)

839
00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:25.883
- Hello.

840
00:49:25.883 --> 00:49:27.060
- Hello. gentleman.

841
00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:28.413
- I know this man.

842
00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:31.690
- This is from.

843
00:49:34.803 --> 00:49:37.487
Pope in castle.
- Pope in castle.

844
00:49:43.072 --> 00:49:44.340
Cardinal Cariott.

845
00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:47.100
This is Dimitri Leoni Disputin Kamarazo.

846
00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:48.903
- I know it's you. how are we doing?

847
00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:52.560
- We just see Pope. we
are at Loveland Castle.

848
00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:54.180
The Pope just to go inside.

849
00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:55.470
- Excellent.

850
00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:58.053
Crush any resistance.

851
00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:03.210
It is imperative that you
secure the Pope in the dungeon.

852
00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:05.193
All of Christendom is counting on you.

853
00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:08.817
- Yes. Your Eminence.

854
00:50:08.817 --> 00:50:11.910
- Let me know when you've succeeded.

855
00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:14.190
- Yes. Your Eminence. we go inside now.

856
00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:15.603
- Yeah. good.

857
00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:21.090
- You go that way.

858
00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:23.513
I go this other way.

859
00:50:23.513 --> 00:50:25.470
- But the Pope went straight.

860
00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:27.273
- This is too easy. could be trap.

861
00:50:28.628 --> 00:50:33.628
- Oh. Dimitri. this is why
you are bigger brother.

862
00:50:34.752 --> 00:50:37.502
(dramatic music)

863
00:50:54.589 --> 00:50:57.256
(door clanking)

864
00:51:05.608 --> 00:51:08.070
- Do you know that we are on a mission

865
00:51:08.070 --> 00:51:10.143
to actually save someone?

866
00:51:11.310 --> 00:51:12.213
Actually two.

867
00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:17.853
- We are on mission to
save all the Christendom.

868
00:51:19.530 --> 00:51:21.120
- Who told you that?

869
00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:23.880
- Cardinal Cariott sent us.

870
00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:28.560
You have to stay here in
dungeon and pray reparations.

871
00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:32.613
one day for every bad
priest in last 100 years.

872
00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:34.620
- He said that?

873
00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:36.927
- Yes. Your Popalness.

874
00:51:38.393 --> 00:51:42.810
- Do you know that I am
deathly allergic to mold?

875
00:51:42.810 --> 00:51:43.643
- No.

876
00:51:44.868 --> 00:51:47.790
- How long do you think I would live

877
00:51:47.790 --> 00:51:49.953
if locked away in a moldy dungeon?

878
00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:54.873
- One day for every bad
priest in last 100 years.

879
00:51:56.250 --> 00:51:57.083
- Lower.

880
00:51:58.140 --> 00:51:59.640
- Six months.

881
00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:00.473
- Lower yet.

882
00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:03.810
- Six days?

883
00:52:03.810 --> 00:52:04.953
- Perhaps.

884
00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:09.810
And Cardinal Cariott put you up to this?

885
00:52:09.810 --> 00:52:12.780
- But he never told us you would die.

886
00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:14.673
This would be evil.

887
00:52:16.830 --> 00:52:20.340
- My son. there are enemies both outside

888
00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:22.443
and inside the Church.

889
00:52:23.351 --> 00:52:25.623
This is one of those times.

890
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:30.360
When was the last time
you went to confession?

891
00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:32.973
- Oh. I don't remember.

892
00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:36.903
The last time Mama made us go.

893
00:52:39.821 --> 00:52:41.433
- You are such a bright boy.

894
00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:45.370
Come. sit down here

895
00:52:55.576 --> 00:52:56.576
and tell me.

896
00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:08.700
- Where is my brother?

897
00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:10.500
- The Pope's hearing his confession.

898
00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:13.410
- Well. I must get in.

899
00:53:13.410 --> 00:53:14.283
We have mission.

900
00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:15.983
- Oh yeah. well. so do I.

901
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:19.110
You're not gonna stop mine.

902
00:53:19.110 --> 00:53:22.650
- But Cardinal Cariott say
we have to save Church.

903
00:53:22.650 --> 00:53:24.310
- The Church always needs renewal

904
00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:27.410
and the Holy Spirit is
taking care of that.

905
00:53:32.456 --> 00:53:33.687
- Okay.

906
00:53:33.687 --> 00:53:36.437
(dramatic music)

907
00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:42.033
- From now on. your
name is no longer Webus.

908
00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:46.773
It is Aloysius. your Christian name.

909
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:48.743
- Thank you.

910
00:53:49.736 --> 00:53:50.970
I never liked Webus.

911
00:53:50.970 --> 00:53:53.673
- Nobody liked Webus. everyone hated it.

912
00:53:55.663 --> 00:53:57.270
Now. are you ready to have some fun?

913
00:53:57.270 --> 00:53:58.173
- Oh yes.

914
00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:01.464
- Now play along with me. huh?

915
00:54:01.464 --> 00:54:02.816
- Okay.

916
00:54:02.816 --> 00:54:03.983
- Ready?
- Yes.

917
00:54:05.613 --> 00:54:06.863
- You did what?

918
00:54:09.406 --> 00:54:10.906
- Stay right here.

919
00:54:11.912 --> 00:54:14.579
(both laughing)

920
00:54:18.790 --> 00:54:23.708
- Now. quickly. go and get
your brother and bring him in.

921
00:54:23.708 --> 00:54:25.208
- [Aloysius] Yeah.

922
00:54:26.853 --> 00:54:29.520
(door creaking)

923
00:54:36.814 --> 00:54:39.564
(dramatic music)

924
00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:42.983
- Sit.

925
00:54:49.050 --> 00:54:51.603
I am going to ask you the same thing.

926
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:55.983
When was the last time
you went to confession?

927
00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:02.670
- I do not remember.

928
00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:05.283
- That is correct. you do not remember.

929
00:55:07.050 --> 00:55:12.050
Whisper in my ear what
you wish to confess.

930
00:55:26.225 --> 00:55:30.142
- I like "Die Hard 2"
better than "Die Hard 1."

931
00:55:37.406 --> 00:55:38.406
- Very well.

932
00:55:39.770 --> 00:55:42.810
Do you have a firm
purpose of making amends?

933
00:55:42.810 --> 00:55:45.363
- Oh yes. Your Holiness. yes.

934
00:55:46.350 --> 00:55:49.680
- Then I absolve you from your sins.

935
00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:54.003
In the name of the Father.
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

936
00:55:56.580 --> 00:56:01.580
- But Your Holiness.
should I not have penance?

937
00:56:04.410 --> 00:56:09.167
- Dimitri. your penance is
to call Cardinal Cariott

938
00:56:10.047 --> 00:56:14.553
and tell him that everything
is well here in the castle.

939
00:56:16.919 --> 00:56:19.586
(both laughing)

940
00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:25.803
- Watch this.

941
00:56:28.693 --> 00:56:30.633
This is going to be good.

942
00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:40.190
Your Eminence. this is Dimitri
Leoni Dispuk Kamarazo again.

943
00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:43.713
- I know who it is.

944
00:56:46.650 --> 00:56:51.650
- I wish to report that Pope
is secure in Loveland Castle.

945
00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:54.630
- Excellent.

946
00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:57.210
You both get a gold star.

947
00:56:57.210 --> 00:57:00.660
Now. lay low. make yourself scarce.

948
00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:02.100
Don't call me.

949
00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:03.090
If you have any trouble.

950
00:57:03.090 --> 00:57:07.200
I will disavow all knowledge
of your actions. capeesh?

951
00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:09.060
- Yes. Your Eminence.

952
00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:09.893
- Good.

953
00:57:11.565 --> 00:57:13.739
(both laughing)

954
00:57:13.739 --> 00:57:16.413
- Excellent. excellent.

955
00:57:17.310 --> 00:57:22.310
How do you feel about
becoming my bodyguards?

956
00:57:25.530 --> 00:57:28.893
- It would be honor of Dimitri life.

957
00:57:30.750 --> 00:57:31.583
- Good.

958
00:57:32.497 --> 00:57:34.110
(both laughing)

959
00:57:34.110 --> 00:57:36.450
- I love it when a plan comes together.

960
00:57:36.450 --> 00:57:38.763
- I wonder what name I should pick.

961
00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:41.490
Bartholomew.
- Bartholomew.

962
00:57:41.490 --> 00:57:45.393
- Oh. Senor. birds of
a feather fly together.

963
00:57:47.415 --> 00:57:48.248
Woo!

964
00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:55.093
- One down and two to go.

965
00:57:56.457 --> 00:57:58.080
Ah. and here they are.

966
00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:01.410
These two gentlemen are my new bodyguards.

967
00:58:01.410 --> 00:58:05.640
Michael. where can they go to wait for us?

968
00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:06.473
- Hmm.

969
00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:10.230
Well. if they like ice cream.

970
00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:12.783
there's a Whippy Dip down by the freeway.

971
00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:15.233
- Whippy Dip?

972
00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:17.850
No matter.

973
00:58:17.850 --> 00:58:20.280
You two brothers go down
there and wait for us

974
00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:22.180
and we'll pick you up on the way back.

975
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:26.850
- Shall we do what we came here for?

976
00:58:26.850 --> 00:58:29.073
- Yes. let's do it.

977
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.516
I am anxious to meet these two.

978
00:58:32.516 --> 00:58:35.183
(Pope knocking)

979
00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:46.357
- You're him?

980
00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:49.113
- Yes. my dear.

981
00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:51.953
- Oh my.

982
00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:57.393
I'm not worthy to have
you enter under my roof.

983
00:58:59.910 --> 00:59:04.053
- Just say the word and I will.

984
00:59:06.613 --> 00:59:07.446
- Word?

985
00:59:09.344 --> 00:59:11.927
(gentle music)

986
00:59:45.802 --> 00:59:48.900
(Beth laughing. snorting)

987
00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:51.123
David. there's someone here to see you.

988
00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:55.590
- Did mail come?

989
00:59:55.590 --> 00:59:58.413
- No. somebody else showed up.

990
01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:02.370
- Oh crap.

991
01:00:02.370 --> 01:00:04.080
Are you kidding me?

992
01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.090
A celebrity look-a-like.

993
01:00:06.090 --> 01:00:07.470
This is Michael's doing. isn't it?

994
01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:09.869
- You know that can't be.

995
01:00:09.869 --> 01:00:11.543
- Oh. contrar.

996
01:00:11.543 --> 01:00:16.413
Michael drove me here and
told me the whole story.

997
01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:18.690
- He what?
- He what?

998
01:00:18.690 --> 01:00:21.180
- He drove us all the way from Cleveland.

999
01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:26.180
me and Michael. Spiro.
Jesse. and Gums and Roses.

1000
01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:30.573
And we had a couple of close
calls along the way too.

1001
01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:35.250
- Now I'm sure he's an imposter.

1002
01:00:35.250 --> 01:00:38.190
- I assure you I am the Pope.

1003
01:00:38.190 --> 01:00:39.930
- I think he is.

1004
01:00:39.930 --> 01:00:41.700
- No way.

1005
01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:44.760
Why would the Pope come
alone to Cincinnati?

1006
01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:47.730
In fact. how could he come alone?

1007
01:00:47.730 --> 01:00:51.120
Doesn't he always have an
entourage with him or something?

1008
01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:56.120
- Really. David. I am the Pope.

1009
01:00:58.350 --> 01:01:00.883
Non illegitimi carborundum.

1010
01:01:02.181 --> 01:01:03.027
- Huh?

1011
01:01:03.027 --> 01:01:06.270
(Pope speaking in foreign language)

1012
01:01:06.270 --> 01:01:07.380
- Come again?

1013
01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:11.203
- I am still the Pope and you are not.

1014
01:01:13.290 --> 01:01:16.380
- No. I am not and neither are you.

1015
01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:17.310
I'm David.

1016
01:01:17.310 --> 01:01:18.143
I don't know who you.

1017
01:01:18.143 --> 01:01:19.681
do you have a picture
or resume or something.

1018
01:01:19.681 --> 01:01:21.030
- Eh. eh. eh. eh.

1019
01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:22.923
I am telling you the truth.

1020
01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:28.380
Michael kidnapped me
and drove me here today.

1021
01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:30.453
- That's really impossible.

1022
01:01:31.352 --> 01:01:32.185
(Pope speaking in foreign language)

1023
01:01:32.185 --> 01:01:34.170
- Oh. a Pope who's into the Talking Heads.

1024
01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:37.623
- Michael died six months ago.

1025
01:01:40.708 --> 01:01:43.860
- Now I found him kneeling
in front of our mailbox.

1026
01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:45.060
stalker 'till the end.

1027
01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:46.920
- Stalkers don't have candles and a rosary

1028
01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:48.063
in their hands. David.

1029
01:01:49.050 --> 01:01:51.330
- Then who drove me?

1030
01:01:51.330 --> 01:01:53.550
- Call your agent. ask him.

1031
01:01:53.550 --> 01:01:55.310
- Wait a minute.

1032
01:01:55.310 --> 01:01:58.260
I can prove I am telling the truth.

1033
01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:03.260
Michael told me something that
only a husband would know.

1034
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:24.573
- How did you know that?

1035
01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:28.983
- Michael told me so you would believe.

1036
01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:35.900
- Okay. suppose you are the
real Pope. why are you here?

1037
01:02:36.570 --> 01:02:37.533
- Why?

1038
01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:42.330
I am here to invite
you to join the Church.

1039
01:02:42.330 --> 01:02:45.270
Isn't that what you said it would take?

1040
01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:46.103
- No.

1041
01:02:46.103 --> 01:02:49.230
- Yes. don't lie to the Pope.

1042
01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:52.413
- Actually. I'm here for you too. my dear.

1043
01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:58.710
My predecessors made a big
effort to invite people

1044
01:02:58.710 --> 01:03:03.060
who have been divorced and
remarried with no annulment

1045
01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:08.060
to come back to Communion
in certain circumstances.

1046
01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:11.573
Why didn't you?

1047
01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:15.533
- I couldn't.

1048
01:03:17.088 --> 01:03:17.921
- Why?

1049
01:03:20.850 --> 01:03:23.700
- Because no matter what anyone says.

1050
01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:28.683
I knew it was wrong because
we didn't get an annulment.

1051
01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:34.740
- Okay buddy. you are outta here.

1052
01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:35.573
- David.

1053
01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:40.770
- Okay. fine. do whatever
you want with this imposter.

1054
01:03:40.770 --> 01:03:43.830
- Would you like for me to
take your confession. my dear?

1055
01:03:43.830 --> 01:03:44.793
- Yes. I would.

1056
01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.883
- Oh my God.

1057
01:03:49.170 --> 01:03:50.003
Gosh.

1058
01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:09.063
- Bless me. Father.

1059
01:04:11.130 --> 01:04:12.003
- Go on. my dear.

1060
01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:15.683
- I forgot.

1061
01:04:21.030 --> 01:04:24.413
- Tell me your sins and
we'll go from there.

1062
01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:31.260
- David.

1063
01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:32.100
(Davis snorting)

1064
01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:36.093
Is there anything else you
need to tell me about all this?

1065
01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:38.693
- No.

1066
01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:41.553
- Nothing at all since Michael died?

1067
01:04:42.990 --> 01:04:43.823
- No.

1068
01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:50.250
- You never told me how we
managed to pay off all the bills

1069
01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:54.030
and the mortgage and then go on vacation.

1070
01:04:54.030 --> 01:04:56.250
One day you were on a ledge and the next

1071
01:04:56.250 --> 01:04:57.963
you were whistling Dixie.

1072
01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:03.703
He left me money. didn't he?

1073
01:05:05.247 --> 01:05:09.400
- Oh. he left us a little. you a little.

1074
01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:10.317
- How much?

1075
01:05:11.715 --> 01:05:12.715
- 1.200.000.

1076
01:05:14.170 --> 01:05:15.253
- $1.200.000.

1077
01:05:17.763 --> 01:05:22.763
- Actually it was $1.206.856 to be exact.

1078
01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:29.823
plus house next door.

1079
01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:35.970
- He owned the house next
door with all the lights

1080
01:05:35.970 --> 01:05:37.263
and you didn't tell me.

1081
01:05:38.370 --> 01:05:41.054
- I was trying to protect you.

1082
01:05:41.054 --> 01:05:42.666
- Protect me?

1083
01:05:42.666 --> 01:05:43.499
Protect?

1084
01:05:43.499 --> 01:05:46.680
David Paul Sheba. I swear I am going to-

1085
01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:48.360
- Beth. Beth.

1086
01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:53.360
- At times like this. it is
best to do something normal.

1087
01:06:05.369 --> 01:06:07.543
(dinosaur roaring)

1088
01:06:07.543 --> 01:06:10.960
(Beth and Pope laughing)

1089
01:06:13.093 --> 01:06:16.426
- [TV Voice] Bad dinosaur. bad dinosaur.

1090
01:06:17.448 --> 01:06:20.514
(dinosaur belching)

1091
01:06:20.514 --> 01:06:21.971
(Pope screaming)
- Oh!

1092
01:06:21.971 --> 01:06:24.930
It's okay. it's just his CPAP.

1093
01:06:24.930 --> 01:06:26.223
He has to clean it.

1094
01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:29.317
- What are you guys watching?

1095
01:06:29.317 --> 01:06:30.267
- "Godzilla."

1096
01:06:31.748 --> 01:06:33.690
- Beth.

1097
01:06:33.690 --> 01:06:36.750
Come. it's funny. bring your mask.

1098
01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:38.636
- I've seen it. it is funny.

1099
01:06:38.636 --> 01:06:39.690
(David and Pope laughing)

1100
01:06:39.690 --> 01:06:42.930
Sweetheart. how long
are you guys gonna be?

1101
01:06:42.930 --> 01:06:44.523
- Now I'm a sweetheart.

1102
01:06:47.332 --> 01:06:48.993
- I better go.

1103
01:06:50.794 --> 01:06:52.860
- No. don't go. it's early.

1104
01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:57.233
- Yes. you two have
some things to work out.

1105
01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:04.890
- Thanks for coming.
best practical joke ever.

1106
01:07:04.890 --> 01:07:05.723
- David.

1107
01:07:07.635 --> 01:07:10.770
- [TV Voice] Is that more
beer? Great. more beer.

1108
01:07:10.770 --> 01:07:13.233
- I never knew you could
get them in cherry.

1109
01:07:15.450 --> 01:07:17.733
- This chocolate is money.

1110
01:07:18.971 --> 01:07:21.554
(bright music)

1111
01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:30.573
- You want a dip top?

1112
01:07:31.770 --> 01:07:33.240
- What is a dip top?

1113
01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:34.173
- What he's got.

1114
01:07:35.130 --> 01:07:39.270
Soft ice cream. hard shell top.

1115
01:07:39.270 --> 01:07:42.003
I'd start with the classic
chocolate on vanilla.

1116
01:07:43.757 --> 01:07:47.116
- Ah. the Whippy Dip.

1117
01:07:47.116 --> 01:07:48.333
- Yeah.

1118
01:07:48.333 --> 01:07:51.633
- I'll have chocolate on
chocolate with sprinkles.

1119
01:07:53.490 --> 01:07:56.103
- Jessie. Gums.

1120
01:07:57.930 --> 01:07:59.730
- Yeah. we'll both have the classic.

1121
01:08:01.287 --> 01:08:04.037
(heavenly music)

1122
01:08:08.177 --> 01:08:09.320
(camera shutter clicks)

1123
01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:11.987
(Pope laughing)

1124
01:08:19.950 --> 01:08:20.783
- Well. I'll be.

1125
01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:28.650
- It's getting too late
to drive back tonight

1126
01:08:28.650 --> 01:08:30.900
so you guys sack out in the cars.

1127
01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:33.120
The Pope and I have a
quick run in the morning

1128
01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:34.830
before we head back.

1129
01:08:34.830 --> 01:08:36.360
- We do?

1130
01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:37.813
- Yeah. we do.

1131
01:08:42.019 --> 01:08:44.019
- Are you the Archangel?

1132
01:08:46.348 --> 01:08:47.961
- No.

1133
01:08:47.961 --> 01:08:49.403
You don't see any wings. do ya?

1134
01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:51.390
- No.

1135
01:08:51.390 --> 01:08:52.503
- I'm just a trainee.

1136
01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:54.233
Second class.

1137
01:08:55.369 --> 01:08:57.952
(gentle music)

1138
01:09:15.342 --> 01:09:17.850
- [Beth] I'm going over
there in the morning.

1139
01:09:17.850 --> 01:09:19.320
- [David] Good. you can find out

1140
01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:21.420
what he was doing back there in the trees.

1141
01:09:23.790 --> 01:09:27.120
- [Beth] So you did know what
those lights were that I saw?

1142
01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:28.530
- [David] No. I didn't.

1143
01:09:28.530 --> 01:09:31.080
I knew he was up to something back there.

1144
01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:33.293
- [Beth] Oh. this just
gets better and better.

1145
01:09:37.530 --> 01:09:39.753
The birth mark on my thigh.

1146
01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:42.460
- [David] Your what?

1147
01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:45.710
- [Beth] Michael told the Pope.

1148
01:09:47.190 --> 01:09:48.633
The Pope told me.

1149
01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:53.710
- [David] Even when he's
dead. he's in our bed.

1150
01:09:58.890 --> 01:10:00.630
- How'd I not know you were this close

1151
01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:02.103
those last few months?

1152
01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:08.986
How could I let you die all alone?

1153
01:10:08.986 --> 01:10:11.569
(somber music)

1154
01:10:17.136 --> 01:10:20.053
(door clicks shut)

1155
01:10:33.896 --> 01:10:37.350
Michael. I thought you were gone.

1156
01:10:40.230 --> 01:10:43.530
- How do you know that
you won't save your spouse

1157
01:10:43.530 --> 01:10:47.160
with your steadfast example
of faith. hope and love?

1158
01:10:55.822 --> 01:10:57.332
- Michael?

1159
01:10:57.332 --> 01:11:00.712
(upbeat music)

1160
01:11:00.712 --> 01:11:01.545
Michael.

1161
01:11:13.814 --> 01:11:18.814
♪ Thinking of your tender touch ♪

1162
01:11:21.474 --> 01:11:26.474
♪ Must have loved you far too much ♪

1163
01:11:27.794 --> 01:11:32.794
♪ And I. I keep hoping that some day ♪

1164
01:11:36.984 --> 01:11:41.984
♪ You'll walk the path that leads my way ♪

1165
01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:47.460
♪ You'll walk the path that leads my way ♪

1166
01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:48.933
- Oh. magnificent.

1167
01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:54.633
Michael. you built this for me.

1168
01:11:58.668 --> 01:12:01.251
(gentle music)

1169
01:12:04.890 --> 01:12:06.753
Why do you love me so much?

1170
01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:21.903
I've never felt closer to
you than I do right now.

1171
01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:26.943
Michael. I am sorry.

1172
01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:30.293
I'm so sorry.

1173
01:12:31.449 --> 01:12:34.866
(gentle music continues)

1174
01:12:50.066 --> 01:12:51.316
- [David] Beth?

1175
01:12:54.690 --> 01:12:55.863
- Amazing. isn't it?

1176
01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:58.800
- Statue. aah.

1177
01:13:01.050 --> 01:13:03.243
- It's always the men who resent her.

1178
01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:06.303
But the women get it.

1179
01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:10.410
- Well. I don't.

1180
01:13:10.410 --> 01:13:11.403
So she had a kid.

1181
01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:24.810
- I don't think you can
make this journey with me.

1182
01:13:24.810 --> 01:13:26.560
Michael didn't cheat on me. did he?

1183
01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:30.993
- No.

1184
01:13:30.993 --> 01:13:34.293
- Then it was you. just like he said.

1185
01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:37.320
He wouldn't lie for you.

1186
01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:39.660
so you came after me to get even.

1187
01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:41.700
- I came after you 'cause I wanted you

1188
01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:44.340
more than anything in my life.

1189
01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:47.580
And don't get on your high
horse about what I did.

1190
01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:49.590
You wanted to leave him.

1191
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:50.580
- What?

1192
01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:52.893
- You turned so easily.

1193
01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:54.960
Don't blame me.

1194
01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:56.160
You got what you wanted.

1195
01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.683
- I want my soul back.

1196
01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:02.210
And I want a husband who
wants his soul back too.

1197
01:14:03.450 --> 01:14:07.953
- Babe. you are so not getting that.

1198
01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:13.530
You want something that I never promised.

1199
01:14:13.530 --> 01:14:15.123
You changed. not me.

1200
01:14:17.490 --> 01:14:18.323
- Then go.

1201
01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:23.853
- Look. Beth. I.

1202
01:14:24.930 --> 01:14:29.583
I'm no good at. you know. religious stuff.

1203
01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:34.800
Forgive me if I would do
anything to have you for myself.

1204
01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:36.120
- It was wrong.

1205
01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:37.620
- He broke the guy code.

1206
01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:39.600
- The one where you lie and cheat for men

1207
01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:41.250
who lie and cheat on their wives?

1208
01:14:44.250 --> 01:14:45.723
- Sounded better in my head.

1209
01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:50.770
- There's a thin line
between love and hate

1210
01:14:52.170 --> 01:14:55.323
and right now you're on
the wrong side of it.

1211
01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:57.720
- What do you want?

1212
01:14:57.720 --> 01:14:59.403
- To keep your word.

1213
01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:02.580
The Pope came.

1214
01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:06.810
Oh my God. the flippin'
Pope came to our house

1215
01:15:06.810 --> 01:15:09.183
to offer you a personal invitation.

1216
01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:15.183
Get an annulment. marry me in the Church.

1217
01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:20.313
and don't be such a prick.

1218
01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:29.703
- All right.

1219
01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:32.433
I'll try.

1220
01:15:33.949 --> 01:15:36.699
(dramatic music)

1221
01:15:55.860 --> 01:15:56.760
- And there it is.

1222
01:15:58.950 --> 01:15:59.783
Finally.

1223
01:16:02.790 --> 01:16:03.663
I'm crushed.

1224
01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:06.183
like Jesus.

1225
01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:14.883
- Loving your enemies is never easy.

1226
01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:19.473
- They were never my enemies.

1227
01:16:24.690 --> 01:16:28.023
- I spy something blue.

1228
01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:34.830
- Ha. the dashboard.

1229
01:16:34.830 --> 01:16:36.387
- He got it the first try.

1230
01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:39.780
- Too bad it's not at night.

1231
01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:41.730
We could play padiddle.
- Oh. yeah.

1232
01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:42.563
- Poodle?

1233
01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:45.183
- Let's sing.

1234
01:16:47.429 --> 01:16:48.262
- Oh.

- So where do donut holes come from?

1246
01:17:30.667 --> 01:17:33.250
(all laughing)

1247
01:17:35.583 --> 01:17:36.583
Donut holes.

1248
01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:41.253
- Papa. how are you enjoying your trip?

1249
01:17:42.395 --> 01:17:45.033
- Well. it was unbelievable.

1250
01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:51.481
And by that I mean no
one will ever believe me.

1251
01:17:51.481 --> 01:17:53.087
(all laughing)

1252
01:17:53.087 --> 01:17:53.937
- Don't even try.

1253
01:17:55.770 --> 01:18:00.770
- You know. I understand why
Michael has kidnapped me.

1254
01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:06.063
I don't understand what
you guys are doing here.

1255
01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:12.690
- We need you to right the ship.

1256
01:18:12.690 --> 01:18:14.823
- He wants you to call a council.

1257
01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:21.060
- Three months in and you are asking me

1258
01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:26.060
to do something that only
happens every 300 years?

1259
01:18:27.810 --> 01:18:30.225
I'll die before it's even over.

1260
01:18:30.225 --> 01:18:31.629
- Over?

1261
01:18:31.629 --> 01:18:32.891
Over?

1262
01:18:32.891 --> 01:18:36.450
It ain't over 'till we say it's over!

1263
01:18:36.450 --> 01:18:37.893
- Nicely said.

1264
01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:43.050
- Oh. I cannot lead something that big.

1265
01:18:43.050 --> 01:18:44.523
I would lose control.

1266
01:18:46.890 --> 01:18:51.243
And the Church. the
Church would be destroyed.

1267
01:18:53.910 --> 01:18:55.081
- Call it.

1268
01:18:55.081 --> 01:18:57.998
(thunder crashing)

1269
01:18:59.730 --> 01:19:01.353
- You just had to ask.

1270
01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:18.120
- We gotta go.

1271
01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:19.570
- Catch you when I come back.

1272
01:19:26.776 --> 01:19:29.526
(dramatic music)

1273
01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:43.313
- Hit me.

1274
01:19:44.610 --> 01:19:45.443
- Why?

1275
01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:48.227
- Just hit me.

1276
01:19:50.048 --> 01:19:51.483
- Okay.

1277
01:19:51.483 --> 01:19:52.316
- Ow.

1278
01:19:53.954 --> 01:19:55.037
- It's okay.

1279
01:19:57.823 --> 01:20:02.823
I was hoping it was a dream.
but clearly I'm awake.

1280
01:20:04.350 --> 01:20:05.580
- Well. you did get a nice nap in

1281
01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:07.113
from Chillicothe to Wooster.

1282
01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:12.243
Hey. thank you.

1283
01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:16.083
Two down. eight billion to go.

1284
01:20:18.030 --> 01:20:19.713
- Just doing my job.

1285
01:20:22.890 --> 01:20:25.337
Oh and about Beth and David.

1286
01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:30.826
With enemies like you. who needs friends?

1287
01:20:30.826 --> 01:20:33.180
(both laughing)

1288
01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:34.013
- Oh.

1289
01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:37.780
where I'm going. I won't
need these anymore.

1290
01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:47.373
- Dimitri. Aloysius. get my things.

1291
01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:52.680
- I carry.

1292
01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:54.127
- No. no. no. you drop too much. I carry.

1293
01:20:54.127 --> 01:20:57.417
- I am bigger brother. carry hat.

1294
01:20:57.417 --> 01:20:59.250
- Ooh. camera. camera.

1295
01:21:01.370 --> 01:21:03.153
Here. you take picture.

1296
01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:07.829
America.
- America.

1297
01:21:07.829 --> 01:21:11.162
(camera shutter clicks)

1298
01:21:14.090 --> 01:21:16.410
- Wait. wait. wait. wait. wait.

1299
01:21:16.410 --> 01:21:19.263
I go that way. you go this way.

1300
01:21:19.263 --> 01:21:21.031
- Why don't we just go straight in?

1301
01:21:21.031 --> 01:21:22.020
- Oh. no. no. no. no.

1302
01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:24.693
He's too easy. could be trap.

1303
01:21:25.770 --> 01:21:27.120
- Getting good. my brother.

1304
01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:32.663
- You did.

1305
01:21:37.798 --> 01:21:40.298
(grand music)

1306
01:22:06.266 --> 01:22:07.358
Did you miss me?

1307
01:22:07.358 --> 01:22:08.789
(press laughing)

1308
01:22:08.789 --> 01:22:10.894
Sit. sit. sit. sit.

1309
01:22:10.894 --> 01:22:12.014
- Were you kidnapped?

1310
01:22:12.014 --> 01:22:13.857
- I know you would like
to know where I was

1311
01:22:13.857 --> 01:22:17.823
and what I was doing. et
cetera. et cetera. et cetera.

1312
01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:22.710
but all I can really tell
you is that everything

1313
01:22:22.710 --> 01:22:26.523
that I was doing is under
the seal of confession.

1314
01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:30.990
So how do you say I scuffed some wine

1315
01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:32.433
to take back to the Vatican?

1316
01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:39.067
Yes. Ohio wine is a very good wine. no?

1317
01:22:39.067 --> 01:22:41.476
(all laughing)

1318
01:22:41.476 --> 01:22:42.309
Ah. he knows.

1319
01:22:43.260 --> 01:22:48.260
And sometimes I feel like I'm
the only cowboy in Ohio today.

1320
01:22:48.364 --> 01:22:51.720
(press laughing)

1321
01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:55.623
Comedy is easy. dying is hard.

1322
01:22:56.670 --> 01:22:59.130
- Why won't the Church get with the times?

1323
01:22:59.130 --> 01:23:03.270
- Why want the times get with the Church?

1324
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:04.680
- Your Holiness. what are you doing

1325
01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:07.230
about the scandals within the Church?

1326
01:23:07.230 --> 01:23:10.413
- There will always be
scandals in the Church.

1327
01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:16.460
The Institution is divine.
but the people in it are not.

1328
01:23:20.310 --> 01:23:23.640
We must do everything we
can to heal the victims

1329
01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:24.723
of our sins.

1330
01:23:25.683 --> 01:23:30.240
The real scandal is the
hierarchy protecting itself

1331
01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:33.420
while the sheep are slaughtered.

1332
01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:37.530
which is precisely why the
Church has real standards for us

1333
01:23:37.530 --> 01:23:41.853
to be judged objectively by when we sin.

1334
01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:47.883
The devil. the devil loves
to turn a priest. why?

1335
01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:54.140
Because he knows he can take
so many others with him.

1336
01:23:55.507 --> 01:23:59.010
But there are hundreds
and thousands of priests

1337
01:23:59.010 --> 01:24:04.010
who have given their lives to
the sheep and have not fallen.

1338
01:24:07.350 --> 01:24:10.950
We must say thank you to them every day.

1339
01:24:10.950 --> 01:24:13.358
every time we see them.

1340
01:24:13.358 --> 01:24:16.020
- But what are you going to do yourself?

1341
01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:18.273
- Believe in our Lord Savior Jesus Christ.

1342
01:24:19.710 --> 01:24:21.243
Serve God in truth.

1343
01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:27.200
Pray and love each and everyone
as God has loved us Himself.

1344
01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:33.393
For in the end. that is the
only thing that one man can do.

1345
01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:38.733
And since the Church is
always in need of renewal.

1346
01:24:39.774 --> 01:24:43.870
I will call the Third Vatican Council

1347
01:24:47.250 --> 01:24:49.020
to put the permanence of marriage

1348
01:24:49.020 --> 01:24:52.440
back into the center of our faith again

1349
01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:56.493
and declare spiritual
warfare against divorce.

1350
01:24:57.990 --> 01:25:00.603
Other than that. nothing.

1351
01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:04.350
Thank you. thank you for coming.

1352
01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:05.910
Thank you for coming.

1353
01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:06.797
Thank you for coming.

1354
01:25:06.797 --> 01:25:09.090
- What's he doing calling a council?

1355
01:25:09.090 --> 01:25:11.580
He's just a temp. a caretaker.

1356
01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:13.020
- Don't worry about it. Cardinal.

1357
01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:15.000
This could play right into our hands.

1358
01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.580
- And just how could that be. horn blower?

1359
01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:19.320
- If we could be sure that he dies

1360
01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:20.850
while we're at the council.

1361
01:25:20.850 --> 01:25:24.480
all the cardinals would already
be in Rome for the vote.

1362
01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:27.153
- If. I don't like that word. if.

1363
01:25:28.082 --> 01:25:30.832
(press chatting)

1364
01:25:33.035 --> 01:25:33.870
- Pontiff Cariott.

1365
01:25:33.870 --> 01:25:35.463
- Yes. Your Holiness.

1366
01:25:36.453 --> 01:25:37.286
- May I have a word?

1367
01:25:54.030 --> 01:25:54.863
- Oh.

1368
01:26:00.150 --> 01:26:01.833
Nice suits. matching.

1369
01:26:04.110 --> 01:26:05.043
Eyebrows as well.

1370
01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:13.770
Holy Father. I'm so glad
to see you home safely.

1371
01:26:13.770 --> 01:26:16.650
but you must prepare us
for this type of thing

1372
01:26:16.650 --> 01:26:19.953
in the future so we do not worry so much.

1373
01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:24.513
- So nice of you to express
such sentiment. Cardinal.

1374
01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:28.913
Would you like me to
hear your confession now?

1375
01:26:30.210 --> 01:26:33.333
- But Your Holiness. I
have nothing to confess.

1376
01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:37.713
- I see.

1377
01:26:40.890 --> 01:26:45.060
Then are you prepared to
go to the ends of the earth

1378
01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:46.950
to proclaim the gospel?

1379
01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:49.080
- Most certainly. Your holiness.

1380
01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:50.800
- I have a new assignment for you

1381
01:26:52.110 --> 01:26:56.137
where you can put such
commitment into practice.

1382
01:26:56.137 --> 01:26:56.970
- Yes.

1383
01:26:56.970 --> 01:27:01.177
- You are now the Cardinal
Archbishop in Sheberghen

1384
01:27:04.935 --> 01:27:06.935
in Northern Afghanistan.

1385
01:27:10.263 --> 01:27:15.213
Well the harvest is few.
but the workers are small.

1386
01:27:16.530 --> 01:27:21.273
- Afghanistan. the sandy. rocky one?

1387
01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:29.160
- [Beth] Shall we pray?

1388
01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:30.390
- Sure.

1389
01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:32.520
Lord. let me get some sleep tonight.

1390
01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:33.900
- That's not a prayer.

1391
01:27:33.900 --> 01:27:34.860
- Well. sure it is.

1392
01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:35.913
- For other people.

1393
01:27:37.386 --> 01:27:39.900
- Then teach me.

1394
01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:41.160
- All right.

1395
01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:44.163
But once you know how. you have to lead.

1396
01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:47.033
- Okay.

1397
01:27:48.570 --> 01:27:49.403
By the way.

1398
01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:54.543
happy anniversary.

1399
01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:59.313
I promise next year I'll remember.

1400
01:28:04.919 --> 01:28:07.586
(both clapping)

1401
01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:12.188
Wanna play spaceman?

1402
01:28:12.188 --> 01:28:13.470
(Beth laughing)

1403
01:28:13.470 --> 01:28:16.035
This is one small step for man

1404
01:28:16.035 --> 01:28:17.640
(David breathing)

1405
01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:21.042
One giant leap for man freakin' kind.

1406
01:28:21.042 --> 01:28:23.130
- Oh. you're so full of
it. he never said that.

1407
01:28:23.130 --> 01:28:24.390
- Oh. sure he did.

1408
01:28:24.390 --> 01:28:26.970
See. he was on a delay and
he fell down the first time

1409
01:28:26.970 --> 01:28:29.670
and had to do it again so
we only saw the second take.

1410
01:28:31.110 --> 01:28:34.293
- We need a second take. not Neil.

1411
01:28:35.550 --> 01:28:38.010
- Okay. take two.

1412
01:28:38.010 --> 01:28:41.783
We're lost in space!

1413
01:28:43.298 --> 01:28:45.965
(both laughing)

1414
01:28:46.923 --> 01:28:47.756
(masks clunk)

1415
01:28:47.756 --> 01:28:49.255
Ow.
- Ow.

1416
01:28:49.255 --> 01:28:51.922
(Beth laughing)

1417
01:28:56.483 --> 01:28:59.252
(dramatic Middle Eastern music)

1418
01:28:59.252 --> 01:29:01.835
(wind howling)

1419
01:29:05.478 --> 01:29:06.311
- Drat!

1420
01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:10.860
- The stone soup's almost
ready. Your Eminence.

1421
01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:13.350
We can play fish later if you like.

1422
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:15.900
- Oh. shut up.

1423
01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:17.013
- Yes. Your eminence.

1424
01:29:18.388 --> 01:29:21.721
(dogs howling. barking)

1425
01:29:26.642 --> 01:29:29.225
(upbeat music)

1426
01:29:34.585 --> 01:29:39.585
♪ You ask me for a reason why I love you ♪

1427
01:29:42.496 --> 01:29:47.496
