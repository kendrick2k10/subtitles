00:01:47.717 --> 00:01:48.526
Uh. Sweden.

4
00:01:49.918 --> 00:01:51.994
I'm... I'm... Swedish

5
00:01:51.994 --> 00:01:53.764
but I speak a little English.

6
00:01:53.764 --> 00:01:54.831
We're coming on board.

7
00:02:02.208 --> 00:02:05.108
All are welcome.
All are welcome.

8
00:02:05.108 --> 00:02:08.279
Even the little one.
He can come too.

9
00:02:09.614 --> 00:02:10.749
Welcome.

10
00:02:16.084 --> 00:02:18.086
Why are you here?

11
00:02:18.086 --> 00:02:19.921
Just a little sailing holiday.

12
00:02:19.921 --> 00:02:21.351
A jolly boys trip.

13
00:02:21.351 --> 00:02:22.161
Take your hands off.

14
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.166
Papers?

15
00:02:27.732 --> 00:02:28.761
Passport?

16
00:02:31.331 --> 00:02:33.128
Here you go.

17
00:02:38.174 --> 00:02:39.970
Any other people on the boat?

18
00:02:40.945 --> 00:02:42.137
Just the two of us.

19
00:02:44.548 --> 00:02:45.613
<i>Nein.</i>

20
00:02:48.584 --> 00:02:50.118
Come. come.
we have lots to eat...

21
00:02:50.118 --> 00:02:52.046
Take your dirty hands off me!

22
00:02:53.321 --> 00:02:54.149
Back off!

23
00:02:57.321 --> 00:02:58.488
And you.

24
00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.528
put your hands in the air!

25
00:03:12.272 --> 00:03:13.811
Ooh!

26
00:03:13.811 --> 00:03:15.241
You're in trouble now!

27
00:03:15.241 --> 00:03:17.172
You've been a naughty boy!

28
00:03:20.317 --> 00:03:22.444
I'll give you 100 francs
to shoot him.

29
00:03:22.444 --> 00:03:23.512
Don't shoot me!

30
00:03:25.454 --> 00:03:28.685
He hates Germans.
You should really shoot him.

31
00:03:28.787 --> 00:03:32.259
I... I'm sorry.
You are very scary.

32
00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:33.696
Make him walk the plank.

33
00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.030
He loves wood.

34
00:03:39.168 --> 00:03:41.372
Dirty drunken animal!

35
00:03:43.072 --> 00:03:44.334
Guilty as charged.

36
00:03:59.083 --> 00:04:00.848
I always take
a can of kerosene

37
00:04:00.848 --> 00:04:02.459
for just
these sort of occasions.

38
00:04:05.061 --> 00:04:06.526
It's been a while.

39
00:04:06.526 --> 00:04:08.525
but the last time
someone laughed at me

40
00:04:08.525 --> 00:04:10.097
when I boarded their vessel.

41
00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:11.967
I gave them the choice.

42
00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:13.864
Either swim to shore

43
00:04:13.864 --> 00:04:16.531
or take their chances
on a burning ship.

44
00:04:18.037 --> 00:04:21.978
Hans and I wondered
which option they'd choose.

45
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.877
death by water or death by fire.

46
00:04:26.446 --> 00:04:27.451
Oddly. they chose both.

47
00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:37.225
They waited
until the very last moment.

48
00:04:37.225 --> 00:04:38.726
until their hair was on fire.

49
00:04:40.631 --> 00:04:43.927
and their blistered skin
peeled from their fingers.

50
00:04:43.927 --> 00:04:46.528
before they immersed
themselves in water

51
00:04:46.528 --> 00:04:47.936
in the vain hope

52
00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:49.341
of reaching shore.

53
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:51.838
One of them

54
00:04:52.869 --> 00:04:54.904
sank immediately and perished.

55
00:04:54.904 --> 00:04:57.272
But to our amazement.
the big one.

56
00:04:58.775 --> 00:04:59.681
he showed great spirit.

57
00:05:01.317 --> 00:05:02.752
<i>In spite of all the odds...</i>

58
00:05:04.288 --> 00:05:06.188
<i>...he painstakingly
made it to shore.</i>

59
00:05:06.188 --> 00:05:08.556
We followed and cheered him on

60
00:05:08.556 --> 00:05:11.154
and rewarded
this impressive achievement

61
00:05:12.326 --> 00:05:13.288
with a bullet

62
00:05:14.494 --> 00:05:16.467
to the back of his head.

63
00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:20.295
Isn't that funny?

64
00:05:21.908 --> 00:05:22.671
Why aren't you laughing?

65
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:12.589
Nice work. Lassen.

66
00:06:14.458 --> 00:06:15.757
There's more
where that came from.

67
00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:17.528
Yes.

68
00:06:24.361 --> 00:06:25.360
Ah...

69
00:06:27.205 --> 00:06:28.363
Not sure it's working. Lassen.

70
00:06:29.572 --> 00:06:31.366
The captain
looks rather agitated.

71
00:06:36.645 --> 00:06:38.640
They're bringing their guns
to bear.

72
00:06:43.014 --> 00:06:44.912
They'll find their range
soon. sir.

73
00:06:45.014 --> 00:06:47.288
Freddy. should we be worried?

74
00:06:47.288 --> 00:06:48.956
Oh. I don't think so. sir.

75
00:06:49.058 --> 00:06:51.692
It's a rather large explosive.
so I set a rather large fuse.

76
00:06:51.692 --> 00:06:53.931
I located the outside
of the powder room.

77
00:06:54.033 --> 00:06:55.065
so when it goes bang.

78
00:06:55.167 --> 00:06:56.294
it really should go bang.

79
00:06:59.231 --> 00:07:00.632
Closer...

80
00:07:00.632 --> 00:07:01.968
Should be any second now. chaps.

81
00:07:07.604 --> 00:07:08.836
Freddy?

82
00:07:14.119 --> 00:07:15.410
Good work. Frederick.

83
00:07:16.187 --> 00:07:17.747
Thank you. Captain.

84
00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:18.881
Now. any chance you can tell us

85
00:07:18.881 --> 00:07:19.955
what we're doing here. sir?

86
00:07:30.131 --> 00:07:32.165
<i>The war in Europe rages on</i>

87
00:07:32.165 --> 00:07:35.601
<i>as Hitler and his Nazi horde
sweep aside all in their path.</i>

88
00:07:35.601 --> 00:07:38.267
<i>Poland. Belgium and now France</i>

89
00:07:38.267 --> 00:07:41.511
<i>have all fallen
to Hitler's fascist regime.</i>

<i>leaving Britain

91
00:07:43.611 --> 00:07:45.879
<i>of liberation
for all of Europe.</i>

92
00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:48.416
<i>So. come on. Blighty.
get ready for a fighty.</i>

93
00:07:48.416 --> 00:07:50.421
<i>But we cannot do it alone.</i>

94
00:07:50.421 --> 00:07:52.521
<i>And any hope
for our American brothers</i>

95
00:07:52.521 --> 00:07:54.453
<i>to join us
from across the Atlantic</i>

96
00:07:54.453 --> 00:07:56.020
<i>remains frustrated</i>

97
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:59.229
<i>by Germany's secret weapon.
the U-boat.</i>

98
00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:01.695
<i>These deadly little submarines</i>

99
00:08:01.695 --> 00:08:03.558
<i>hunt at will
in the North Atlantic.</i>

100
00:08:03.558 --> 00:08:07.295
<i>Undetectable. the U-boat
sinks ships indiscriminately.</i>

101
00:08:07.295 --> 00:08:10.074
<i>whether carrying
munitions. provisions</i>

102
00:08:10.074 --> 00:08:11.706
<i>or civilians heading</i>

103
00:08:11.706 --> 00:08:13.906
<i>from our companions
across the pond.</i>

104
00:08:13.906 --> 00:08:16.641
<i>So long as the U-boats
rule the Atlantic.</i>

105
00:08:16.641 --> 00:08:18.110
<i>it remains impossible</i>

106
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:20.981
<i>for America's brave troops
to reach our shores.</i>

107
00:08:20.981 --> 00:08:24.279
<i>Will Britain be forced
to appease Hitler's plans</i>

108
00:08:24.279 --> 00:08:27.391
<i>or face devastation
from his offensive?</i>

109
00:08:27.391 --> 00:08:29.890
<i>London burns
and her seas run red.</i>

110
00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.921
<i>as bombs from above
and torpedoes from below</i>

111
00:08:32.921 --> 00:08:34.489
<i>grind the Brits down.</i>

112
00:08:34.489 --> 00:08:37.300
<i>And with no defense
against these lethal U-boats.</i>

113
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:39.466
<i>it appears all hope may be lost</i>

114
00:08:39.466 --> 00:08:41.206
<i>for peace in Europe.</i>

115
00:08:44.006 --> 00:08:46.501
The Germans cut off
our supply chain with U-boats.

116
00:08:48.173 --> 00:08:50.406
we cut off the supply chain
to the U-boats.

117
00:08:51.976 --> 00:08:53.214
Through our intelligence agents.

118
00:08:53.316 --> 00:08:54.648
we've found a way.

119
00:08:59.717 --> 00:09:01.590
<i>The entire</i>

<i>is operated
by two Nazi tug boats...</i>

123
00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:13.704
<i>and an Italian supply ship
in Fernando Po.</i>

124
00:09:13.806 --> 00:09:18.673
I need men who are willing
to go and sink those ships.

125
00:09:18.673 --> 00:09:20.869
Why don't we just
air-raid Fernando Po

126
00:09:20.971 --> 00:09:22.044
and sink the ships?

127
00:09:23.778 --> 00:09:28.312
Because crafty Germans.

128
00:09:28.312 --> 00:09:30.784
<i>have positioned themselves
in a Spanish colony.</i>

129
00:09:30.784 --> 00:09:33.356
<i>Fernando Po
is neutral territory.</i>

130
00:09:33.356 --> 00:09:35.352
<i>If we attack that colony.</i>

131
00:09:35.352 --> 00:09:37.890
<i>the rest of unoccupied Europe
will join the Nazis.</i>

132
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:39.163
<i>and it's only
a question of time</i>

133
00:09:39.163 --> 00:09:40.230
<i>before we find ourselves</i>

134
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:41.694
<i>frying big pink sausages</i>

135
00:09:41.694 --> 00:09:42.799
wearing nothing but lederhosen.

136
00:09:44.767 --> 00:09:46.770
Hitler is not
playing by the rules

137
00:09:47.602 --> 00:09:48.563
and neither are we.

138
00:09:49.871 --> 00:09:52.310
This will of course be
an unsanctioned.

139
00:09:52.412 --> 00:09:53.975
unauthorized
and unofficial mission.

140
00:09:56.207 --> 00:09:57.907
If they're captured
by the British.

141
00:09:58.009 --> 00:09:58.947
they'll be thrown in jail.

142
00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:01.983
But if the Nazis find them...

143
00:10:04.883 --> 00:10:06.053
it's torture and death.

144
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:08.984
<i>Somewhat contentiously.</i>

145
00:10:08.984 --> 00:10:10.855
<i>I may have just the man.</i>

146
00:10:10.855 --> 00:10:12.687
<i>but rather inconveniently.</i>

147
00:10:12.687 --> 00:10:15.260
<i>he's currently incarcerated
at His Majesty's pleasure.</i>

148
00:10:16.435 --> 00:10:17.592
<i>We may not like his attitude.</i>

149
00:10:18.436 --> 00:10:20.595
but he's bold. he's a killer.

150
00:10:22.806 --> 00:10:24.170
and the men
will follow him anywhere.

151
00:10:25.476 --> 00:10:27.470
Are we sure this is a good idea?

152
00:10:29.479 --> 00:10:31.038
Of course we're not.

153
00:10:31.038 --> 00:10:32.244
But we're desperate.

154
00:10:33.584 --> 00:10:35.218
- Send him in.

155
00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:36.686
Forward!

156
00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:40.857
Stand there. Major.

157
00:10:54.637 --> 00:10:55.630
Thank you. Sergeant.

158
00:11:00.477 --> 00:11:01.707
Gus March-Phillips.

159
00:11:01.809 --> 00:11:02.873
this is Lieutenant Commander...

160
00:11:02.873 --> 00:11:05.339
Fleming. Ian Fleming.

161
00:11:05.441 --> 00:11:06.777
He used to be
at Naval Intelligence.

162
00:11:06.777 --> 00:11:07.719
now he works for me.

163
00:11:11.157 --> 00:11:12.754
Why am I here. M?

164
00:11:12.754 --> 00:11:15.358
I have a mission
I want you to lead.

165
00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:18.496
Why are you asking me. M?

166
00:11:18.496 --> 00:11:19.698
Help yourself
to a cup of tea. Major.

167
00:11:33.675 --> 00:11:36.847
We both know that I'm...

168
00:11:38.947 --> 00:11:42.850
not very popular
with the administration.

169
00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:45.215
The reason
they find you unattractive

170
00:11:45.317 --> 00:11:47.990
is the very reason
I find you attractive.

171
00:11:49.457 --> 00:11:50.492
Mission?

172
00:11:50.492 --> 00:11:52.154
Operation Postmaster.

173
00:11:52.154 --> 00:11:53.593
To neutralize the German U-boats

174
00:11:53.695 --> 00:11:54.689
in the North Atlantic.

175
00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.372
- And. uh. what's the plan?

176
00:12:02.372 --> 00:12:04.166
The U-boats need

177
00:12:04.166 --> 00:12:05.769
- fuel and torpedoes.
- Oh.

178
00:12:05.871 --> 00:12:06.940
But they also need

179
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.539
carbon dioxide filters
for oxygen.

180
00:12:09.539 --> 00:12:11.277
Without them. they can't dive
and they can't hunt.

181
00:12:12.817 --> 00:12:14.379
Stuck on the surface.
they're obsolete.

182
00:12:18.882 --> 00:12:20.522
Target?

183
00:12:20.522 --> 00:12:22.387
The <i>Duchessa d'Aosta.</i>

184
00:12:22.387 --> 00:12:24.526
She's an Italian ship
the Germans have been using...

185
00:12:30.964 --> 00:12:33.262
...to refuel.
re-arm and replenish

186
00:12:33.364 --> 00:12:36.036
the CO2 filters
for the entire fleet.

187
00:12:36.036 --> 00:12:38.741
She's hidden
off the coast of West Africa.

188
00:12:38.741 --> 00:12:41.379
A small island
called Fernando Po.

189
00:12:41.379 --> 00:12:44.811
We want you to. um. sink her.

190
00:12:44.811 --> 00:12:46.582
You'll be posing as fishermen

191
00:12:46.582 --> 00:12:48.016
sailing down the west coast

192
00:12:48.016 --> 00:12:49.716
on board a trawler
loaded with enough explosives

193
00:12:49.716 --> 00:12:51.819
to destroy the <i>Duchessa.</i>

194
00:12:51.819 --> 00:12:54.219
This is Agents
Heron and Stewart.

195
00:12:54.219 --> 00:12:57.023
They'll be working
undercover on the island.

196
00:12:57.023 --> 00:12:58.594
Mr. Heron's
already established there.

197
00:12:58.594 --> 00:13:00.460
running various businesses.

198
00:13:00.563 --> 00:13:02.029
What businesses?

199
00:13:02.029 --> 00:13:05.463
A casino bar.
and illegal exports game.

200
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:07.902
Profitable?

201
00:13:07.902 --> 00:13:09.840
- I do quite well.

202
00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.404
High-ranking Nazis
are my most valued clients.

203
00:13:12.971 --> 00:13:13.768
Good for you.

204
00:13:17.573 --> 00:13:19.508
Miss Stewart.
an actress and singer.

205
00:13:19.611 --> 00:13:21.416
has been training with us
for the last two years.

206
00:13:21.416 --> 00:13:22.618
She'll be posing

207
00:13:22.618 --> 00:13:24.280
as a gold trader from New York.

208
00:13:24.382 --> 00:13:26.119
Her mission is
to seduce and distract

209
00:13:26.221 --> 00:13:28.120
the island's Commanding
Officer Heinrich Luhr.

210
00:13:28.222 --> 00:13:30.994
She's very capable
and somewhat motivated.

211
00:13:31.991 --> 00:13:33.860
Motivated how. sir?

212
00:13:33.963 --> 00:13:35.867
My mother's side
were German Jews.

213
00:13:37.602 --> 00:13:39.029
They were the first to go.

214
00:13:39.029 --> 00:13:40.437
Very sorry to hear that.

215
00:13:40.437 --> 00:13:41.932
I'm sure you'll recover.

216
00:13:41.932 --> 00:13:43.706
We have 44 days

217
00:13:43.808 --> 00:13:45.673
before the Nazis
move their operation.

218
00:13:45.775 --> 00:13:46.801
We won't find them again.

219
00:13:50.508 --> 00:13:53.442
If I'm to do this.
I'll need my own team.

220
00:13:53.442 --> 00:13:55.612
You won't like them.
They're all. uh...

221
00:13:58.256 --> 00:14:00.087
mad.

222
00:14:00.087 --> 00:14:02.817
They'll need to be.
Give us their names.

223
00:14:06.694 --> 00:14:08.063
Henry Hayes.

224
00:14:08.063 --> 00:14:11.601
<i>A smart. young Irishman
who hates the Nazis</i>

225
00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:12.998
<i>because his older brother.</i>

226
00:14:12.998 --> 00:14:15.269
<i>who was a close friend of mine.</i>

227
00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:18.072
<i>drowned after a U-boat
sank his fishing trawler.</i>

228
00:14:18.072 --> 00:14:21.072
<i>I've taken him under my wing
ever since.</i>

229
00:14:21.072 --> 00:14:23.138
He's cunning. quiet and wily.

230
00:14:23.138 --> 00:14:24.507
More to the point.

231
00:14:24.507 --> 00:14:27.347
Hayes is a magnificent sailor
and I trust him.

232
00:14:28.888 --> 00:14:31.282
If we're going
to try and sink a large ship.

233
00:14:31.282 --> 00:14:34.455
we'll need
Freddy "The Buzz" frogman.

234
00:14:34.455 --> 00:14:37.492
<i>He can swim across the channel
with his feet tied together.</i>

235
00:14:37.492 --> 00:14:39.293
<i>Admittedly.</i>

236
00:14:39.293 --> 00:14:41.028
<i>he's a convicted arsonist
and a terrible misery</i>

237
00:14:41.028 --> 00:14:43.097
<i>unless he's destroying something.</i>

238
00:14:43.097 --> 00:14:45.497
But he's very good
at blowing things up.

239
00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:49.336
Next. we'll need
the Danish hammer.

240
00:14:50.508 --> 00:14:52.509
Anders Lassen.

241
00:14:52.509 --> 00:14:53.778
<i>Grew up wrestling bears</i>

242
00:14:53.778 --> 00:14:55.511
<i>and hunting elk
on his family estate.</i>

243
00:14:55.511 --> 00:14:56.781
<i>He's a legend</i>

244
00:14:56.781 --> 00:14:58.848
<i>with a Bowie knife
and a bow and arrow.</i>

245
00:14:58.848 --> 00:15:01.183
<i>He ran away at 18
to fight the Nazis</i>

246
00:15:01.183 --> 00:15:03.679
<i>after the Gestapo tortured
his brother to death.</i>

247
00:15:03.679 --> 00:15:06.754
<i>He gave up filleting game
for gutting Nazis.</i>

248
00:15:06.856 --> 00:15:08.624
He then turned up on our shores

249
00:15:08.726 --> 00:15:10.187
ready to fight alongside us.

250
00:15:10.187 --> 00:15:12.520
He is an uncontrollable mad dog

251
00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.496
who knows
a hundred creative ways

252
00:15:14.496 --> 00:15:15.593
to kill a man.

253
00:15:16.698 --> 00:15:18.398
And finally.

254
00:15:18.398 --> 00:15:21.401
and most importantly.
we'll need Geoffrey Appleyard.

255
00:15:22.542 --> 00:15:25.409
Yes. we thought you might.

256
00:15:25.511 --> 00:15:27.307
That's why we sent him

257
00:15:27.307 --> 00:15:28.741
<i>on a reconnaissance mission
to Fernando Po.</i>

258
00:15:28.741 --> 00:15:29.812
Unfortunately.

259
00:15:29.914 --> 00:15:31.345
the Nazis nabbed him
on his return.

260
00:15:31.345 --> 00:15:34.546
All the more reason.
He knows what we need to know.

261
00:15:35.587 --> 00:15:36.985
He's a master planner.

262
00:15:37.087 --> 00:15:40.623
a master survivor.
a chess grand master

263
00:15:40.725 --> 00:15:42.092
and a surgeon with the blade.

264
00:15:44.921 --> 00:15:48.760
<i>We spent two weeks together
in a Dunkirk foxhole</i>

265
00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.926
<i>and if it wasn't for Apple.
I would still be there today.</i>

266
00:15:53.803 --> 00:15:54.929
No Apple. no mission.

267
00:15:55.806 --> 00:15:57.174
I'm afraid that's impossible.

268
00:15:57.174 --> 00:15:58.202
Why?

269
00:15:58.202 --> 00:16:00.339
<i>Because he's being held</i>

270
00:16:00.339 --> 00:16:03.006
<i>by an entire German garrison
on La Palma.</i>

271
00:16:05.947 --> 00:16:07.483
La Palma's on the way.

272
00:16:08.945 --> 00:16:10.846
- That's insanity.
- You let me worry about that.

273
00:16:14.761 --> 00:16:16.852
I must get me
one of those coats.

274
00:16:44.789 --> 00:16:45.821
Now. any chance you can tell us

275
00:16:45.821 --> 00:16:47.122
what we're doing here. sir?

276
00:16:47.122 --> 00:16:49.288
Dry yourself off. frogman.
and I'll tell you.

277
00:16:49.288 --> 00:16:51.359
The curiosity is
eating us all up. sir.

278
00:16:55.628 --> 00:16:57.662
<i>I apologize
for all the secrecy. chaps.</i>

279
00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:00.170
But this is

280
00:17:00.272 --> 00:17:05.532
an unsanctioned. unofficial
and unauthorized mission.

281
00:17:05.634 --> 00:17:07.302
If we're picked up by the Brits.

282
00:17:07.302 --> 00:17:08.178
we will all go to jail.

283
00:17:10.212 --> 00:17:11.877
If we're picked up
by the Germans.

284
00:17:11.979 --> 00:17:13.007
torture and death.

285
00:17:15.118 --> 00:17:16.344
So. it's just
the four of us then?

286
00:17:16.446 --> 00:17:18.714
And Captain Appleyard.

287
00:17:18.816 --> 00:17:21.650
He's responsible
for securing this information.

288
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:24.929
He is. however.
in a spot of bother.

289
00:17:24.929 --> 00:17:27.765
He is being held
by the Germans on La Palma.

290
00:17:27.867 --> 00:17:29.295
Our first job
is to liberate him.

291
00:17:29.295 --> 00:17:30.935
- Oh. so. that's all. is it?
-No.

292
00:17:31.037 --> 00:17:33.002
We need to confirm
Appleyard's intelligence.

293
00:17:33.002 --> 00:17:34.731
That's why
there are two more agents

294
00:17:34.833 --> 00:17:37.299
on their way to Fernando Po
by train. as we speak.

295
00:17:37.299 --> 00:17:39.103
Doing what. exactly?

296
00:17:39.103 --> 00:17:40.240
They'll be ensuring

297
00:17:40.342 --> 00:17:42.375
that those ships
are filled with supplies.

298
00:17:42.478 --> 00:17:44.445
so they're worth blowing up
in the first place.

299
00:17:49.484 --> 00:17:52.385
It's one thing
taking over the world.

300
00:17:52.487 --> 00:17:54.048
but do they have to
take over the kitchen too?

301
00:17:55.489 --> 00:17:58.961
It's all sausage.
cabbage and black bread.

302
00:17:59.063 --> 00:18:00.791
Who would
you have preferred?

303
00:18:00.893 --> 00:18:04.627
The French offer
the refined classical take.

304
00:18:04.627 --> 00:18:08.203
<i>Cote de boeuf.
fromage. le beurre...</i>

305
00:18:08.203 --> 00:18:10.537
<i>- ca suffit!</i>

306
00:18:10.537 --> 00:18:13.067
What about the rustic
spontaneity of the Italians?

307
00:18:14.772 --> 00:18:19.215
Their oils. the linguine.
the tomatoes.

308
00:18:19.215 --> 00:18:21.717
I'd climb over the linguine
to get to the fettucine.

309
00:18:21.717 --> 00:18:23.916
But the cinghiale.

310
00:18:23.916 --> 00:18:24.980
Mmm.

311
00:18:26.088 --> 00:18:27.785
You have me with the wild boar.

312
00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:31.693
But then again.
the Spanish offer

313
00:18:31.693 --> 00:18:32.994
the smorgasbord

314
00:18:33.097 --> 00:18:36.360
of the regional paella
and tapas.

315
00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.565
And Jamon Iberico Andalucia.

316
00:18:39.537 --> 00:18:41.730
So?

317
00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:44.103
We're between
a rock and a hard place.

318
00:18:44.103 --> 00:18:45.632
If the Brits win the war.

319
00:18:45.734 --> 00:18:47.101
we're stuck with fish and chips.

320
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:49.147
If the Germans win the war.

321
00:18:50.915 --> 00:18:52.315
we're stuck with this menu.

322
00:18:53.485 --> 00:18:54.515
So?

323
00:18:56.318 --> 00:18:58.747
We'll have the sausage.
the cabbage

324
00:18:58.747 --> 00:18:59.949
- and the black bread please.

325
00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.116
<i>Tres bien. Merci.</i>

326
00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:20.607
Our situation?

327
00:19:21.612 --> 00:19:22.972
Steady.

328
00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:33.719
Steady.

329
00:19:40.994 --> 00:19:42.156
Now.

330
00:19:54.977 --> 00:19:56.005
Mmm.

331
00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:04.016
I'm exhausted.

332
00:20:24.843 --> 00:20:26.409
<i>Entschuldigung. bitte.</i>

333
00:20:35.085 --> 00:20:36.116
Halt!

334
00:20:52.333 --> 00:20:53.271
Is there a problem?

335
00:21:04.514 --> 00:21:05.943
I can manage
myself. thank you.

336
00:21:09.317 --> 00:21:10.785
Allow me. Miss Stewart.

337
00:21:25.365 --> 00:21:26.260
Allow me.

338
00:21:26.903 --> 00:21:27.937
Thank you.

339
00:21:30.465 --> 00:21:31.600
<i>Prost!</i>

340
00:21:47.759 --> 00:21:48.788
Door.

341
00:21:49.958 --> 00:21:50.988
Locked.

342
00:21:57.835 --> 00:21:59.362
Case?

343
00:21:59.362 --> 00:22:00.637
Working on it.

344
00:22:25.931 --> 00:22:26.892
Sir. contact.

345
00:22:29.167 --> 00:22:30.324
- Contact.

346
00:22:30.967 --> 00:22:32.128

Receipt confirmed.

Urgent. Chequers.

362
00:23:12.208 --> 00:23:14.636
Get the car ready.
Inform Fleming.

363
00:23:14.636 --> 00:23:15.578
Let's pack it up.

364
00:23:17.247 --> 00:23:18.443
No point robbing the bank

365
00:23:18.545 --> 00:23:20.115
if there's no gold in the vault.

366
00:23:27.023 --> 00:23:28.058
Thank you.

367
00:23:28.058 --> 00:23:29.359
It's truly comforting to know

368
00:23:29.359 --> 00:23:31.187
there's at least one gentleman
in the world.

369
00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:34.094
Ah!
Idiot!

370
00:23:37.398 --> 00:23:38.634
Good day.

371
00:23:52.349 --> 00:23:56.454
Sausage. cabbage
and black bread.

372
00:24:02.657 --> 00:24:04.356
<i>Hitler
has made us an offer.</i>

373
00:24:04.356 --> 00:24:05.689
<i>An appeasement.</i>

374
00:24:05.689 --> 00:24:07.694
<i>But we must step down our army.</i>

375
00:24:07.694 --> 00:24:10.825
<i>surrender our Navy
and accept Nazi rule.</i>

376
00:24:10.825 --> 00:24:12.766
<i>Otherwise. he promises</i>

377
00:24:12.766 --> 00:24:16.565
<i>total destruction of Britain
and her empire.</i>

378
00:24:16.565 --> 00:24:18.539
Our best option

379
00:24:18.539 --> 00:24:20.610
is to take Hitler's deal
while we can.

380
00:24:22.245 --> 00:24:24.348
The Air Marshal agrees.

381
00:24:24.348 --> 00:24:28.942
He has more bombs.
more men. more machines.

382
00:24:29.044 --> 00:24:30.981
We won't survive much longer.

383
00:24:31.083 --> 00:24:34.291
You have to make
the only decision you can make

384
00:24:34.291 --> 00:24:36.021
<i>in good conscience.
Prime Minister.</i>

385
00:24:36.021 --> 00:24:38.428
<i>Good God. girls.
Listen to yourselves.</i>

386
00:24:38.428 --> 00:24:40.926
<i>It's not appeasement.
it's surrender.</i>

387
00:24:40.926 --> 00:24:43.425
You still fail to realize
who we're up against.

388
00:24:43.425 --> 00:24:47.137
With respect. Prime Minister.
it's you who doesn't realize.

389
00:24:47.137 --> 00:24:48.539
We cannot hope to defeat him.

390
00:24:50.342 --> 00:24:53.368
Hitler is
the mainspring of evil.

391
00:24:54.177 --> 00:24:55.445
a guttersnipe.

392
00:24:55.445 --> 00:24:57.445
This is not a man
that we can negotiate with.

393
00:24:57.445 --> 00:24:59.383
I've read his book.
Admiral Pound.

394
00:24:59.485 --> 00:25:02.348
The man is a vicious.
victimized ideologue.

395
00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:03.477
He cannot be trusted.

396
00:25:06.316 --> 00:25:07.188
If I thought that
we could've achieved peace

397
00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:08.322
through surrendering.

398
00:25:08.322 --> 00:25:10.317
I'd have done it already.

399
00:25:10.317 --> 00:25:12.660
<i>We need to stop our country
from starving.</i>

400
00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:14.925
<i>We need
three million tons of supplies</i>

401
00:25:14.925 --> 00:25:17.458
to cross the Atlantic
every month.

402
00:25:17.458 --> 00:25:19.828
We are currently losing
50% of that to U-boat attacks.

403
00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:22.570
Another reason to take the deal.

404
00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:24.806
I've not finished.
Algernon. darling.

405
00:25:26.375 --> 00:25:28.070
<i>We need the Americans.</i>

406
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:29.842
<i>and they will
never enter the war</i>

407
00:25:29.842 --> 00:25:31.808
<i>if we already appear
to be a losing side.</i>

408
00:25:31.808 --> 00:25:34.350
Ending hostilities with Germany

409
00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:36.418
is the best path
out of this mess.

410
00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.381
We are all in agreement.
Prime Minister.

411
00:25:40.554 --> 00:25:41.515
Thank you. gentlemen.

412
00:25:46.024 --> 00:25:47.197
Yes.
thank you. gentlemen!

413
00:25:53.428 --> 00:25:55.236
<i>M. Fleming.
this better be good news.</i>

414
00:25:55.236 --> 00:25:56.338
<i>Prime Minister.</i>

415
00:25:56.338 --> 00:25:58.207
<i>we have the manifest here. sir.</i>

416
00:25:58.207 --> 00:25:59.774
<i>It's been confirmed</i>

417
00:25:59.774 --> 00:26:01.511
<i>the</i> Duchessa
<i>is fully laden with supplies</i>

418
00:26:01.511 --> 00:26:03.875
to keep the U-boats
operational indefinitely.

419
00:26:03.977 --> 00:26:07.611
If we're going to sink her.
now is the time.

420
00:26:07.713 --> 00:26:09.015
They're on their way.

421
00:26:10.352 --> 00:26:11.551
And their chances?

422
00:26:11.551 --> 00:26:14.548
Well. if anyone can. they can.

423
00:26:19.164 --> 00:26:20.826
But if we're discovered.

424
00:26:20.826 --> 00:26:22.798
parliament will remove you
from office.

425
00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.932
Well.

426
00:26:27.035 --> 00:26:28.798
we'd better make sure
we're not discovered then.

427
00:26:32.268 --> 00:26:33.375
We'll take it
from the cliffside.

428
00:26:33.375 --> 00:26:35.705
It's an 85-foot sheer climb.

429
00:26:35.705 --> 00:26:36.841
No one should notice

430
00:26:36.841 --> 00:26:39.013
a small. innocuous
fishing vessel.

431
00:26:39.013 --> 00:26:41.448
We'll set up in the woods
and see what we're up against.

432
00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:43.552
then we'll go for a night raid.

433
00:26:43.552 --> 00:26:46.250
Slip in quietly.
find Apple. come out fast.

434
00:26:46.859 --> 00:26:48.118
Numbers?

435
00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:50.584
Intelligence suggests
a garrison of 50 to 60.

436
00:26:52.022 --> 00:26:53.863
That should be about 15 each.

437
00:26:53.863 --> 00:26:57.431
Lassen. try not to be greedy.
You do have a reputation.

438
00:26:57.431 --> 00:26:59.899
My killing days are over.

439
00:26:59.899 --> 00:27:02.136
I'm just here
as a peacekeeping observer.

440
00:27:04.235 --> 00:27:06.901
Freddy. bag the kit.
silence the weapons.

441
00:27:51.487 --> 00:27:52.912
When do we go?

442
00:27:52.912 --> 00:27:54.758
0200.

443
00:27:54.758 --> 00:27:57.484
Take the towers first.
then move onto the radio room.

444
00:27:57.484 --> 00:27:59.653
barracks and end up
in the control room...

445
00:28:01.767 --> 00:28:03.459
- What do we have here?

446
00:28:04.167 --> 00:28:05.464
Gestapo.

447
00:28:05.464 --> 00:28:07.199
How'd you know?

448
00:28:07.301 --> 00:28:10.199
The badder they are.
the better they're dressed.

449
00:28:10.301 --> 00:28:12.374
I really must get me
one of those coats.

450
00:28:12.476 --> 00:28:13.975
They must be here for Apple.

451
00:28:15.471 --> 00:28:18.177
It's either torture
or. uh. extraction. sir.

452
00:28:18.177 --> 00:28:20.482
If they extract him.
it'll be the end of Apple.

453
00:28:20.482 --> 00:28:21.675
We won't be seeing him again.

454
00:28:22.716 --> 00:28:23.983
I'm afraid. gentlemen.

455
00:28:23.983 --> 00:28:25.653
we're not going
to have the luxury of night.

456
00:28:25.653 --> 00:28:26.982
We're going
to have to go in now.

457
00:28:40.034 --> 00:28:41.202
So.
what's happened there then?

458
00:28:41.305 --> 00:28:42.529
It looks like

459
00:28:42.529 --> 00:28:43.603
they've been plugged
full of arrows. Haysey.

460
00:28:43.705 --> 00:28:44.698
Well. where did the arrows go?

461
00:28:45.971 --> 00:28:46.777
Straight through them.

462
00:28:50.614 --> 00:28:53.216
There were
two more round the other side.

463
00:28:53.318 --> 00:28:54.415
Where are they now?

464
00:28:54.517 --> 00:28:56.350
Same place as these two.

465
00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:57.818
Nazi heaven.

466
00:28:57.818 --> 00:28:59.453
Well. we've got
less than seven minutes

467
00:28:59.555 --> 00:29:00.785
before they're missed.

468
00:29:00.887 --> 00:29:03.016
Alarms. dogs. None of it good.

469
00:29:04.152 --> 00:29:05.727
Go undercover of the engine.

470
00:29:05.727 --> 00:29:07.556
Only break cover
when things go bang.

471
00:29:11.161 --> 00:29:12.569
I have a great idea. Lassen.

472
00:29:12.569 --> 00:29:14.229
Why don't you march off
by yourself

473
00:29:14.331 --> 00:29:15.800
and fill those Germans
full of arrows?

474
00:29:26.447 --> 00:29:28.579
Freddy. grab the scissors
and help him with that fence.

475
00:29:28.579 --> 00:29:29.649
Aye. sir.

476
00:29:49.971 --> 00:29:51.573
Haysey. you're with me.
We go left.

477
00:29:51.573 --> 00:29:54.403
Freddy. Lassen. you go right.

478
00:29:54.403 --> 00:29:56.112
Fill your boots. gentlemen.
and bon appetit.

479
00:30:00.146 --> 00:30:01.751
- See you at the tower.

480
00:30:01.751 --> 00:30:03.447
And remember. gentlemen.
try to have fun.

481
00:30:42.618 --> 00:30:44.992
-  So far. so good.

482
00:30:45.094 --> 00:30:46.692
- Doing rather well. Haysey.

483
00:30:46.794 --> 00:30:47.892
Oh. why thank you. sir.

484
00:31:05.682 --> 00:31:06.981
It's very good.

485
00:31:44.854 --> 00:31:47.015
Sounds like
stealth mode's over.

486
00:31:47.015 --> 00:31:48.090
Haysey. down!

487
00:32:54.923 --> 00:32:56.257
<i>- Nein! Nein!</i>

488
00:33:29.091 --> 00:33:29.851
Do we know each other?

489
00:33:30.794 --> 00:33:32.557
- No.

490
00:33:49.207 --> 00:33:51.306
Is that a heart. Lassen?

491
00:33:51.306 --> 00:33:52.811
For the avoidance of doubt.

492
00:33:52.811 --> 00:33:55.115
Apple. old boy.

493
00:33:55.115 --> 00:33:56.647
- Gus.
-I see you two have met.

494
00:33:57.687 --> 00:33:59.351
This is Haysey.

495
00:33:59.453 --> 00:34:01.921
-Pleasure. Haysey.
- Pleasure's mine.

496
00:34:02.023 --> 00:34:03.225
I thought you might need these.

497
00:34:04.222 --> 00:34:06.090
Jolly thoughtful of you.

498
00:34:06.192 --> 00:34:07.020
You all find him?

499
00:34:08.697 --> 00:34:09.858
Oh. goody.

500
00:34:12.036 --> 00:34:13.103
Bloody hell.
what happened to your nipples?

501
00:34:17.806 --> 00:34:19.868
You all right?

502
00:34:19.868 --> 00:34:22.277
Couldn't unplug me. could you?
Battery's still on.

503
00:35:40.287 --> 00:35:41.950
Did you see the <i>Duchessa.</i>

504
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:44.751
the tug boats?

505
00:35:44.751 --> 00:35:47.021
And rather
a lot of Nazi soldiers.

506
00:35:48.228 --> 00:35:49.966
Why wasn't that in your report?

507
00:35:49.966 --> 00:35:54.033
Because those soldiers
and those guns.

508
00:35:54.135 --> 00:35:56.701
and those S-Boats are all new.

509
00:35:58.605 --> 00:36:01.637
That's a lot more
than the boys are expecting.

510
00:36:01.739 --> 00:36:03.811
A month ago.
it was a dozen mechanics.

511
00:36:03.811 --> 00:36:04.944
Six drunk sailors.

512
00:36:04.944 --> 00:36:06.276
Two fat Spaniards.

513
00:36:06.276 --> 00:36:07.976
And a Nazi in a pear tree.

514
00:36:10.516 --> 00:36:12.453
I'd say.
we're gonna need more help.

515
00:36:14.616 --> 00:36:16.056
You leave that to me.

516
00:36:16.056 --> 00:36:17.419
- Of course.

517
00:36:20.196 --> 00:36:21.856
-But right now...

518
00:36:21.958 --> 00:36:24.027
- ...you need to meet that man.

519
00:36:27.234 --> 00:36:29.471
Your man.
The reason you're here.

520
00:36:29.471 --> 00:36:31.303
Ah.

521
00:36:31.303 --> 00:36:33.375
The only thing
worse than a Nazi...

522
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:35.740
is him.

523
00:37:03.537 --> 00:37:05.437
I'm very disappointed. Heron.

524
00:37:05.437 --> 00:37:07.735
There are 16 crates
in my warehouse

525
00:37:07.837 --> 00:37:10.341
you have not yet
shipped to the mainland.

526
00:37:10.341 --> 00:37:12.479
No need to fret. <i>Herr</i> Luhr.

527
00:37:12.479 --> 00:37:13.681
They'll still be delivered
by the agreed date.

528
00:37:13.681 --> 00:37:15.115
That may be.

529
00:37:15.115 --> 00:37:17.445
But they take up valuable space.

530
00:37:17.445 --> 00:37:18.515
For this. I expect

531
00:37:18.515 --> 00:37:20.686
a significant reduction
in your fee.

532
00:37:22.324 --> 00:37:23.893
-I can do 5%...

533
00:37:23.893 --> 00:37:25.525
...as a gesture of goodwill.

534
00:37:25.525 --> 00:37:29.064
Twenty. And don't waste
my precious time haggling.

535
00:37:29.064 --> 00:37:30.129
Well.
strictly speaking.

536
00:37:30.231 --> 00:37:31.596
there should be no reductions.

537
00:37:31.699 --> 00:37:34.535
since there's not yet been
any breach of contract.

538
00:37:34.535 --> 00:37:38.231
Five is more than polite.
20 rings like a sour note.

539
00:37:38.906 --> 00:37:40.035
it jars.

540
00:37:40.611 --> 00:37:42.539
It jars?

541
00:37:42.539 --> 00:37:45.246
Am I being
accused of disharmony?

542
00:37:45.246 --> 00:37:47.449
I take that
as a personal affront.

543
00:37:50.684 --> 00:37:54.081
And I am supposing
you are not the secretary.

544
00:37:54.081 --> 00:37:57.157
Miss Stewart is the contact
I said I'd arrange.

545
00:37:57.157 --> 00:37:59.626
Ah. your New York gold contact?

546
00:38:00.896 --> 00:38:01.955
I told you.

547
00:38:02.057 --> 00:38:04.257
I already have
a satisfying arrangement.

548
00:38:05.032 --> 00:38:06.063
Have a seat.

549
00:38:06.063 --> 00:38:07.331
Thank you.

550
00:38:12.475 --> 00:38:14.267
Well.
I hope I don't disappoint.

551
00:38:17.546 --> 00:38:19.514
I can't make a decision
on this presentation.

552
00:38:20.245 --> 00:38:21.546
Early days.

553
00:38:21.546 --> 00:38:23.581
Well. if early days
do come too soon.

554
00:38:23.581 --> 00:38:25.520
and seasons change
with a Hunter's Moon.

555
00:38:33.565 --> 00:38:34.331
Hmm.

556
00:38:35.094 --> 00:38:37.033
Hmm.

557
00:38:37.135 --> 00:38:37.932
I have to say. Heron.

558
00:38:37.932 --> 00:38:39.632
for all your flaws.

559
00:38:39.734 --> 00:38:41.701
you do have a habit
of pulling rabbits from hats.

560
00:38:46.406 --> 00:38:49.309
So. how much gold
do you wish to move.

561
00:38:49.309 --> 00:38:50.347
- Miss Stewart?

562
00:38:52.807 --> 00:38:54.879
As much as you can find.

563
00:39:00.023 --> 00:39:02.391
As I mentioned before.

564
00:39:02.391 --> 00:39:05.389
I do already have
a very profitable arrangement.

565
00:39:05.491 --> 00:39:07.955
And despite of your commentary.

566
00:39:07.955 --> 00:39:10.400
I pride myself
on maintaining harmony.

567
00:39:11.695 --> 00:39:14.371
Now. why should I entertain you?

568
00:39:17.475 --> 00:39:19.599
Because you'll make more money
and have lots of fun

569
00:39:19.599 --> 00:39:20.575
whilst doing so.

570
00:39:22.478 --> 00:39:25.811
If I'm not good for my word.
don't pay me.

571
00:39:41.996 --> 00:39:42.828
Bravo.

572
00:39:44.667 --> 00:39:47.261
I will talk to my people
and then we'll rendezvous.

573
00:39:48.035 --> 00:39:49.065
Lovely.

574
00:39:53.475 --> 00:39:55.275
When the sly red cat
barks at dawn.

575
00:39:55.275 --> 00:39:57.279
and kills just for her pleasure.

576
00:39:57.381 --> 00:40:00.214
who shares the meal
the cat did steal

577
00:40:00.214 --> 00:40:01.583
when both looked on in pleasure?

578
00:40:04.482 --> 00:40:05.422
<i>Auf wiedersehen.</i>

579
00:40:52.895 --> 00:40:54.296
The riddle was a nice touch.

580
00:40:58.107 --> 00:40:59.273
The hook's in.

581
00:41:02.379 --> 00:41:04.140
Now be careful
how you reel him in.

582
00:41:15.521 --> 00:41:16.718
I'll make sure
the harbor's empty

583
00:41:16.718 --> 00:41:17.923
when the boys arrive.

584
00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:21.360
How are you going to do that?

585
00:41:21.462 --> 00:41:23.363
I'll throw a party at my club.

586
00:41:23.363 --> 00:41:25.995
A costume party for the officers

587
00:41:26.098 --> 00:41:27.966
and a second party at the dock
for the soldiers.

588
00:41:29.766 --> 00:41:30.771
People like my parties.

589
00:41:31.976 --> 00:41:33.136
Everyone but Luhr.

590
00:41:33.935 --> 00:41:35.707
That will be your job.

591
00:41:35.707 --> 00:41:37.514
All the rats
will follow the piper.

592
00:41:45.621 --> 00:41:46.386
So.
if I understand correctly.

593
00:41:46.489 --> 00:41:47.983
we're currently
here in La Palma.

594
00:41:48.085 --> 00:41:49.925
We'll sail around
German-controlled Africa

595
00:41:49.925 --> 00:41:50.985
to Fernando Po.

596
00:41:51.087 --> 00:41:52.722
which is just
north of the Equator.

597
00:41:52.722 --> 00:41:54.493
just off the West African coast.

598
00:41:54.493 --> 00:41:56.629
So that's the shortest route?

599
00:41:56.629 --> 00:41:58.199
Yes. but we don't
want to go shorter.

600
00:41:58.301 --> 00:42:00.200
Our priority is not to be seen.

601
00:42:00.302 --> 00:42:02.769
You mean. be seen again.

602
00:42:02.769 --> 00:42:05.965
Again? Getting a little sloppy
on us now. Gussy?

603
00:42:05.965 --> 00:42:07.341
Had a run-in already?

604
00:42:07.341 --> 00:42:09.073
Never mind us. Apple. old boy.

605
00:42:10.014 --> 00:42:11.471
Remind me again

606
00:42:11.471 --> 00:42:12.948
how you found your nipples
attached to a car battery.

607
00:42:14.316 --> 00:42:15.947
Yes. Wasn't my fault.

608
00:42:15.947 --> 00:42:17.649
Bad intelligence.
Plus it was almost worth it

609
00:42:17.649 --> 00:42:19.047
to watch
the heart-snatcher at work.

610
00:42:19.149 --> 00:42:21.054
I'm better known as a lover
than a fighter.

611
00:42:21.157 --> 00:42:22.414
Jesus Christ!

612
00:42:22.517 --> 00:42:23.986
If that's how you fight.
I'd hate to see you love.

613
00:42:23.986 --> 00:42:25.353
You don't have
to worry about that.

614
00:42:26.626 --> 00:42:28.658
you're too pretty for me.

615
00:42:28.658 --> 00:42:30.523
Freddy. on the other hand...

616
00:42:31.994 --> 00:42:33.526
You'd have to catch me first.

617
00:42:34.335 --> 00:42:35.572
I do love to hunt.

618
00:42:37.008 --> 00:42:38.036
You'd be lucky.

619
00:42:39.034 --> 00:42:40.500
I'm really getting quite hot.

620
00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:43.343
Anyway. my suggestion is
that we take this wider route.

621
00:42:43.343 --> 00:42:44.812
<i>It's obviously longer</i>

622
00:42:44.812 --> 00:42:45.877
<i>but it should avoid
any awkward conversations</i>

623
00:42:45.877 --> 00:42:48.611
<i>with German U-boats
or British warships.</i>

624
00:42:48.611 --> 00:42:49.781
<i>Weather-dependent.</i>

625
00:42:49.781 --> 00:42:51.544
<i>we should make it there
in 15 days.</i>

626
00:42:52.582 --> 00:42:53.819
Agreed.

627
00:42:53.819 --> 00:42:55.548
Haysey. do you think
you could manage that?

628
00:42:56.589 --> 00:42:57.620
Leave it to me. sir.

629
00:43:21.414 --> 00:43:23.211
Just do as you're told

630
00:43:23.211 --> 00:43:24.713
- and get me another drink!

631
00:43:24.713 --> 00:43:25.913
Captain. sir.

632
00:43:26.015 --> 00:43:27.320
Can I get you something to eat?

633
00:43:27.422 --> 00:43:28.689
May I... Come this way.

634
00:43:28.689 --> 00:43:29.817
- Take your hands off me.

635
00:43:32.557 --> 00:43:33.586
You know.

636
00:43:35.231 --> 00:43:35.995
I like you. Femi.

637
00:43:38.065 --> 00:43:41.002
But you touch me again
and you're going to jail.

638
00:43:41.002 --> 00:43:42.067
Femi.

639
00:43:47.376 --> 00:43:48.436
I'll deal with him.

640
00:43:49.611 --> 00:43:50.603
Please take care
of Miss Stewart.

641
00:43:53.616 --> 00:43:55.480
You know what you need.
Captain Binea?

642
00:43:55.582 --> 00:43:56.609
I know what I need.

643
00:43:57.386 --> 00:44:00.283
But do you. Ricardo?

644
00:44:01.786 --> 00:44:03.319
You need another drink.

645
00:44:06.095 --> 00:44:07.127
Marty.

646
00:44:07.229 --> 00:44:08.692
good stuff.

647
00:44:08.794 --> 00:44:12.092
Ricardo. that's why I love you.

648
00:44:12.092 --> 00:44:13.494
- You understand.

649
00:44:14.503 --> 00:44:15.628
This is Fernando Po.

650
00:44:16.933 --> 00:44:17.938
Everybody's welcome.

651
00:44:19.276 --> 00:44:21.271
<i>Si...</i> Everybody.

652
00:44:22.609 --> 00:44:24.144
Too many body I think.

653
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:29.147
Armando?

654
00:44:30.753 --> 00:44:32.651
Have you fallen out
with our new friends?

655
00:44:32.651 --> 00:44:34.482
It's not fair. Ricardo.

656
00:44:35.291 --> 00:44:36.649
This is my harbor.

657
00:44:37.656 --> 00:44:39.328
I am in charge.

658
00:44:39.328 --> 00:44:40.923
Are they stepping on your toes?

659
00:44:40.923 --> 00:44:42.089
They don't step. they stamp!

660
00:44:42.089 --> 00:44:44.099
They tell Captain Binea nothing.

661
00:44:47.831 --> 00:44:49.066
Only now do I hear

662
00:44:49.066 --> 00:44:50.567
the <i>Duchessa</i>
is leaving the harbor early.

663
00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:54.304
Well. good riddance.

664
00:44:55.676 --> 00:44:57.076
The harbor will be yours again.

665
00:44:59.342 --> 00:45:01.674
When will you be free
of that ugly vessel?

666
00:45:02.352 --> 00:45:03.676
Three days earlier.

667
00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:06.679
Then we should
have another drink.

668
00:45:07.951 --> 00:45:09.987
To celebrate. Marty...

669
00:45:09.987 --> 00:45:11.926
Another round
for our Harbor Master.

670
00:45:13.622 --> 00:45:17.160
So. Captain. do you know
where they wish to relocate?

671
00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:20.528
It's neither cat nor dog
that kills for fun.

672
00:45:21.537 --> 00:45:23.696
it's the vixen. not another.

673
00:45:24.806 --> 00:45:27.241
There's only two
that kill for fun.

674
00:45:27.343 --> 00:45:29.543
my pretty friend.

675
00:45:29.543 --> 00:45:32.612
the fox and his human brother.

676
00:45:49.425 --> 00:45:51.724
I believe I have
resolved your little riddle.

677
00:45:53.469 --> 00:45:56.203
<i>Chapeau.</i> You play well.

678
00:45:59.408 --> 00:46:00.909
Speaking of foxes.

679
00:46:02.537 --> 00:46:05.738
Horowitz and Meyer.
West 47th Street.

680
00:46:06.614 --> 00:46:07.575
Have you heard of them?

681
00:46:08.749 --> 00:46:09.918
I don't believe I have. no.

682
00:46:43.982 --> 00:46:45.518
They're the largest gold traders

683
00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:47.423
in Midtown New York

684
00:46:47.423 --> 00:46:48.781
and you haven't heard of them?

685
00:46:49.988 --> 00:46:51.652
I'm afraid I haven't. no.

686
00:46:54.228 --> 00:46:56.324
I am familiar. of course.
with Horowitz and Haim.

687
00:46:56.426 --> 00:46:58.659
But they're in the west side
of the city.

688
00:47:01.404 --> 00:47:02.628
But then again.

689
00:47:02.628 --> 00:47:04.368
I'm sure you already
knew that. didn't you?

690
00:47:10.808 --> 00:47:11.804
I'm curious.

691
00:47:13.244 --> 00:47:15.379
how do you find
dealing with the Jew?

692
00:47:16.486 --> 00:47:18.684
Oh. dear.

693
00:47:18.786 --> 00:47:19.884
I've slipped from one snare

694
00:47:19.884 --> 00:47:21.616
only to find myself in another.

695
00:47:23.625 --> 00:47:24.487
How shall I put this?

696
00:47:25.463 --> 00:47:26.796
I fear your brilliant leader

697
00:47:26.796 --> 00:47:28.865
has mischaracterized
the ancient tribe of Jahuda.

698
00:47:29.698 --> 00:47:31.064
Their ability to not only

699
00:47:31.064 --> 00:47:33.732
survive 3.000 years
with a boot on their neck.

700
00:47:33.834 --> 00:47:37.137
but to prosper in spite of it...

701
00:47:37.137 --> 00:47:39.832
I suspect it inspired
satanic jealousy within him.

702
00:47:40.938 --> 00:47:42.076
In conclusion.

703
00:47:43.006 --> 00:47:44.480
it looks as though

704
00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:47.048
the lady doth protest too much.

705
00:47:51.989 --> 00:47:54.752
Is there a cherry to go
on this blasphemous cake.

706
00:47:54.854 --> 00:47:56.125
or have you finished?

707
00:48:00.694 --> 00:48:03.194
I must confess.

708
00:48:03.296 --> 00:48:05.726
not only do I respect
and admire the Jew...

709
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:09.702
I am one.

710
00:48:31.318 --> 00:48:32.093
Kidding!

711
00:48:33.728 --> 00:48:34.887
They're greedy rats.

712
00:48:38.898 --> 00:48:40.032
I think this could be

713
00:48:40.032 --> 00:48:41.938
the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

714
00:48:43.907 --> 00:48:46.233
Then I shall throw a party
to celebrate.

715
00:48:46.335 --> 00:48:48.205
I don't care for parties.

716
00:48:48.205 --> 00:48:51.745
Oh. spoilsport!
Everybody loves a party.

717
00:48:54.142 --> 00:48:55.211
The <i>Duchessa's</i> leaving

718
00:48:55.211 --> 00:48:57.477
three days earlier
than we thought.

719
00:48:57.477 --> 00:48:58.581
If we don't tell
the <i>Maid Honor.</i>

720
00:48:59.787 --> 00:49:00.913
they'll arrive too late.

721
00:49:11.532 --> 00:49:12.828
Incoming.

722
00:49:14.401 --> 00:49:15.235
Contact.

723
00:49:16.865 --> 00:49:18.931
More Jerries
on the island than expected.

724
00:49:20.239 --> 00:49:21.769
Tin of corned beef's
out of pantry

725
00:49:22.644 --> 00:49:23.608
three days early.

726
00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:29.016
I'll take that.

727
00:49:29.016 --> 00:49:30.118
It's confidential.
sir. For M only.

728
00:49:32.823 --> 00:49:33.786
When it comes
to make the extraction.

729
00:49:33.786 --> 00:49:34.851
it needs to be a very...

730
00:49:34.953 --> 00:49:35.948
Sir. Message. sir.

731
00:49:40.093 --> 00:49:43.197
More Jerries
on the island than expected.

732
00:49:45.559 --> 00:49:46.830
Corned beef's out of the pantry

733
00:49:46.932 --> 00:49:47.960
three days early.

734
00:49:48.966 --> 00:49:51.063
Move faster.

735
00:49:51.063 --> 00:49:53.438
Yes. but there's increased
U-boat sightings in the area.

736
00:49:54.003 --> 00:49:54.967
Sir.

737
00:50:02.183 --> 00:50:03.184
The mission's
still proceeding.

738
00:50:06.683 --> 00:50:08.722
So. there's more
soldiers on the island

739
00:50:08.824 --> 00:50:09.818
and the boat's leaving earlier?

740
00:50:09.818 --> 00:50:11.155
Yes.

741
00:50:11.257 --> 00:50:12.627
Well. how are
we meant to move faster?

742
00:50:12.627 --> 00:50:13.827
We can't move faster.

743
00:50:13.827 --> 00:50:15.623
We're going as fast as we can.

744
00:50:15.623 --> 00:50:17.660
This is a fishing boat.
it's not a speedboat.

745
00:50:18.426 --> 00:50:19.893
<i>Prime Minister.</i>

746
00:50:19.893 --> 00:50:21.768
<i>the</i> Duchessa's <i>leaving
Fernando Po in 12 days.</i>

747
00:50:21.768 --> 00:50:23.399
<i>On our current schedule.</i>

748
00:50:23.399 --> 00:50:24.997
<i>they'll arrive
three days too late.</i>

749
00:50:26.808 --> 00:50:28.536
Can it still be done?

750
00:50:28.536 --> 00:50:30.271
<i>We're still
awaiting a response</i>

751
00:50:30.271 --> 00:50:31.080
<i>from Major Phillips.</i>

752
00:50:33.214 --> 00:50:35.246
If we can't move faster.
we'll go shorter.

753
00:50:35.246 --> 00:50:37.282
We can get to Fernando Po
in 12 days.

754
00:50:37.282 --> 00:50:38.480
Hold on. you said
we couldn't go shorter.

755
00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:40.285
No. I said
we don't want to go shorter.

756
00:50:40.285 --> 00:50:43.088
He said we'll get
mowed down by a U-boat.

757
00:50:43.088 --> 00:50:46.457
Or worse.
picked up by the Brits.

758
00:50:46.457 --> 00:50:48.359
Their armada of destroyers
are crossing there.

759
00:50:48.462 --> 00:50:50.924
We will literally
be sailing over U-boats.

760
00:50:51.966 --> 00:50:54.103
Sorry. lads. we go shorter.

761
00:51:17.359 --> 00:51:20.294
<i>Drei. zwei. eins...</i>

762
00:51:42.515 --> 00:51:44.582
<i>Gentlemen.
as I speak to you now.</i>

763
00:51:45.447 --> 00:51:47.189
<i>London once again</i>

764
00:51:47.189 --> 00:51:49.917
<i>shudders beneath a Nazi
onslaught from the skies.</i>

765
00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:52.258
<i>And at such times.</i>

766
00:51:52.258 --> 00:51:55.360
<i>the hearts of men
are stirred to duty.</i>

767
00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:56.396
<i>But you are not such men.</i>

768
00:51:57.195 --> 00:51:58.495
<i>You were not chosen</i>

769
00:51:58.495 --> 00:52:01.669
<i>for your conspicuous honor
or high ideals.</i>

770
00:52:01.669 --> 00:52:02.729
<i>You were chosen</i>

771
00:52:02.729 --> 00:52:04.665
<i>because you are
the last resort.</i>

772
00:52:04.665 --> 00:52:05.865
<i>The mission
you have been given</i>

773
00:52:05.865 --> 00:52:09.441
<i>is of a sort
never before undertaken.</i>

774
00:52:09.441 --> 00:52:14.115
<i>It demands ruthless men.
who will not hesitate</i>

775
00:52:14.115 --> 00:52:17.818
<i>to stoop beneath
the conventions of war.</i>

776
00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:19.914
Men who do not keep clean hands.

777
00:52:21.625 --> 00:52:23.555
Men like you.

778
00:52:23.555 --> 00:52:25.356
<i>- And yet. who still conspire</i>

779
00:52:25.356 --> 00:52:27.956
<i>in their own
discordant harmony.</i>

780
00:52:27.956 --> 00:52:32.759
<i>Who know and yet do not care
that they may never return.</i>

781
00:52:32.759 --> 00:52:36.034
<i>And who press onward
not for glory.</i>

782
00:52:36.034 --> 00:52:38.403
<i>or for duty. or for me.</i>

783
00:52:38.403 --> 00:52:41.071
<i>but because you are men
who will not stop</i>

784
00:52:41.071 --> 00:52:42.134
<i>until it is done.</i>

785
00:52:43.307 --> 00:52:44.609
<i>Godspeed. gentlemen.</i>

786
00:52:54.856 --> 00:52:56.654
Uh... Chaps...

787
00:52:58.653 --> 00:53:00.152
That's a British destroyer.

788
00:53:03.832 --> 00:53:05.668
We should move.

789
00:53:05.770 --> 00:53:07.159
We can't outrun that. sir.

790
00:53:09.666 --> 00:53:13.165
Well. we've seen them.
they've seen us.

791
00:53:19.412 --> 00:53:21.080
Hold fast. <i>Maid Honor.</i>

792
00:53:21.183 --> 00:53:22.882
We're preparing
a boarding party.

793
00:53:22.984 --> 00:53:24.176
Hello. Captain!

794
00:53:25.613 --> 00:53:27.514
Nothing exciting here.

795
00:53:27.616 --> 00:53:29.517
We're just Swedish fishermen.

796
00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:31.183
Step forward. Jorgensen!

797
00:53:32.995 --> 00:53:34.327
Jorgensen. you're Swedish.

798
00:53:34.327 --> 00:53:35.561
Ask them where
they're heading. would you?

799
00:53:41.201 --> 00:53:42.096
Not you. Lassen.

800
00:53:42.198 --> 00:53:43.195
Uh...

801
00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:47.243
I want to hear March-Phillips
have a go.

802
00:53:48.039 --> 00:53:49.069
Ah.

803
00:53:50.977 --> 00:53:52.881
Fair enough.

804
00:53:52.881 --> 00:53:55.113
Game's up. Commander.

805
00:53:55.215 --> 00:53:56.685
Can't blame a girl for trying.

806
00:53:56.685 --> 00:53:58.110
Good effort. Major.

807
00:53:58.212 --> 00:54:00.284
But I'm afraid you are going
to have to come with us.

808
00:54:00.284 --> 00:54:02.086
May I ask under whose authority

809
00:54:02.188 --> 00:54:03.748
we've been waylaid?

810
00:54:03.850 --> 00:54:05.217
On the orders of Admiral Pound.

811
00:54:10.197 --> 00:54:11.226
First Lieutenant.

812
00:54:11.226 --> 00:54:12.297
You are pursuing

813
00:54:12.399 --> 00:54:15.067
an unsanctioned
criminal enterprise

814
00:54:15.067 --> 00:54:17.532
in international waters.

815
00:54:17.532 --> 00:54:19.570
You're going to cause an upset.

816
00:54:19.672 --> 00:54:23.142
I think we're a little
past upset. Commander.

817
00:54:23.142 --> 00:54:24.671
Stevens. what have you got?

818
00:54:24.671 --> 00:54:25.809
I had a ping. sir.

819
00:54:26.883 --> 00:54:28.150
The greedy little Nazi

820
00:54:28.252 --> 00:54:30.713
won't be satisfied
with holding most of Europe.

821
00:54:30.713 --> 00:54:33.317
he's after our own
green and pleasant land.

822
00:54:33.317 --> 00:54:34.715
Well. thank God you're here

823
00:54:34.715 --> 00:54:35.922
with your little
wooden battleship

824
00:54:36.024 --> 00:54:38.256
and your five-man army.

825
00:54:38.256 --> 00:54:41.161
- U-boat. bearing 273.

826
00:54:41.161 --> 00:54:42.322
- Sound the alarm.

827
00:54:42.424 --> 00:54:43.892
Come aboard.

828
00:54:43.892 --> 00:54:45.798
U-boat approaching.
Starboard side. sir.

829
00:54:45.901 --> 00:54:47.795
Battle stations!

830
00:54:47.897 --> 00:54:50.337
Major. if you know
what's good for you.

831
00:54:50.337 --> 00:54:52.900
- you'll head home.
- Very good. Commander.

832
00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:53.908
Haysey. get us away
from that torpedo magnet

833
00:54:53.908 --> 00:54:55.240
as quickly as possible.

834
00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:57.703
Aye. sir. Apple. man the stern.

835
00:54:57.703 --> 00:54:59.247
Freddy. on the main sail.

836
00:54:59.247 --> 00:55:01.540
Lassen to the bow. now.
Untie that station!

837
00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:02.917
Aye.

838
00:55:02.917 --> 00:55:05.385
Quickly now. lads!

839
00:55:05.385 --> 00:55:07.488
Hoist that foresail for us.
will you. boys?

840
00:55:09.157 --> 00:55:10.590
Main sail ready to haul!

841
00:55:15.762 --> 00:55:17.423
All right. Freddy.
now raise that main sail!

842
00:55:17.423 --> 00:55:18.761
Aye.

843
00:55:18.761 --> 00:55:20.166
-Report sounding.

844
00:55:20.268 --> 00:55:21.667
-Bearing 163.

845
00:55:30.611 --> 00:55:31.637
Lassen. trim the main sail

846
00:55:31.739 --> 00:55:33.211
and then tie it off!

847
00:55:33.313 --> 00:55:34.614
How do you expect good?

848
00:55:36.481 --> 00:55:37.576
Report sounding.

849
00:55:37.576 --> 00:55:39.286
Bearing 115.

850
00:55:39.286 --> 00:55:40.381
-Fire depth charges.

851
00:56:14.788 --> 00:56:17.489
So. this is your man
that gets things done?

852
00:56:17.489 --> 00:56:20.352
His name is Kamp Billy...
with a K.

853
00:56:23.465 --> 00:56:25.027
And he went
to an English boarding school?

854
00:56:26.502 --> 00:56:29.537
Not just any boarding school.
He went to Eton.

855
00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:32.364
the boarding school.

856
00:56:33.842 --> 00:56:34.872
Right...

857
00:56:38.807 --> 00:56:39.679
Then what's he doing here?

858
00:56:40.246 --> 00:56:41.840
He's a prince.

859
00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:44.285
A prince of what. exactly?

860
00:56:44.387 --> 00:56:47.222
- The Prince of Fernando Po!

861
00:56:47.222 --> 00:56:50.382
So. he's part pirate.
part aristocrat?

862
00:56:51.552 --> 00:56:53.458
Chic.

863
00:56:53.458 --> 00:56:55.387
He's also
a part of our solution.

864
00:56:57.767 --> 00:56:59.031
RH.

865
00:56:59.865 --> 00:57:00.964
KB.

866
00:57:01.663 --> 00:57:02.902
He's back in town.

867
00:57:03.004 --> 00:57:03.769
Chief.

868
00:57:12.109 --> 00:57:14.406
Seems like
you always come bearing gifts.

869
00:57:16.084 --> 00:57:17.911
Is she for me?

870
00:57:18.013 --> 00:57:19.411
- Good luck with that.

871
00:57:20.517 --> 00:57:21.413
I'm not for you.

872
00:57:22.519 --> 00:57:24.090
but these are.

873
00:57:24.090 --> 00:57:26.426
Mmm. Goodies. Yummy.

874
00:57:29.429 --> 00:57:30.422
-  Ade...
- Chief.

875
00:57:31.794 --> 00:57:32.859
Come on. come on.

876
00:57:36.434 --> 00:57:37.836
Someone has taste.

877
00:57:39.075 --> 00:57:40.734
Rarer than hens' teeth.

878
00:57:40.734 --> 00:57:45.310
Well. RH tells me that KB

879
00:57:45.412 --> 00:57:46.908
is the only man to talk to

880
00:57:46.908 --> 00:57:49.548
when it comes
to getting things done.

881
00:57:49.548 --> 00:57:51.286
Why do I feel like
I've gone from being

882
00:57:51.286 --> 00:57:53.621
- the predator to the prey?

883
00:58:00.887 --> 00:58:02.958
Quite an entrance. young lady.

884
00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:04.632
It's on the condition
that we sample them...

885
00:58:05.802 --> 00:58:06.832
now.

886
00:58:10.271 --> 00:58:11.730
Ade. set the table.

887
00:58:11.730 --> 00:58:12.800
Chief.

888
00:58:12.903 --> 00:58:15.208
And then the Duke said.

889
00:58:15.310 --> 00:58:16.911
"Push it in till it stops!"

890
00:58:22.581 --> 00:58:25.180
You are quite the weapon.

891
00:58:25.955 --> 00:58:26.852
I was right.

892
00:58:27.925 --> 00:58:29.052
I was the prey.

893
00:58:32.319 --> 00:58:35.762
I'll help you
because I don't like Nazis.

894
00:58:35.762 --> 00:58:38.796
Not because they're Nazis
but because they're gauche.

895
00:58:38.796 --> 00:58:40.793
I'll give you a tug
and 12 of my best men.

896
00:58:40.793 --> 00:58:42.329
including yours truly.

897
00:58:43.936 --> 00:58:46.834
But if I'm gonna help you.
who's gonna help me?

898
00:58:46.937 --> 00:58:48.742
Because you're
not a soldier. RH.

899
00:58:50.013 --> 00:58:52.306
No. but she is.

900
00:58:55.548 --> 00:58:57.014
She'll outshoot your best man.

901
00:59:34.188 --> 00:59:34.953
I told you.

902
00:59:38.753 --> 00:59:40.293
- No!
- No!

903
00:59:42.562 --> 00:59:43.962
Stork delivery. Check.

904
00:59:45.033 --> 00:59:46.299
Check.

905
00:59:46.401 --> 00:59:47.966
Twenty-three boys. Check.

906
00:59:49.230 --> 00:59:50.639
- Stork delivery.

907
00:59:53.241 --> 00:59:56.240
Twenty-three boys.

908
00:59:56.343 --> 00:59:59.680
Seventeen girls.

909
00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:02.882
Meeting point 20 kilometers
outside Fernando Po.

910
01:00:04.452 --> 01:00:05.247
The rendezvous with Heron.

911
01:00:06.684 --> 01:00:07.715
Can you get us there?

912
01:00:07.715 --> 01:00:09.053
If the weather holds.

913
01:00:10.257 --> 01:00:11.291
I can. sir.

914
01:00:28.808 --> 01:00:30.305
Twenty quid says
this doesn't end well.

915
01:00:31.145 --> 01:00:32.175
For who?

916
01:00:32.774 --> 01:00:34.276
For them.

917
01:00:34.276 --> 01:00:36.608
You can't bet on yourself.
Haysey. That's match-fixing.

918
01:00:38.615 --> 01:00:39.611
Let's do it.

919
01:00:40.884 --> 01:00:42.256
Heron. it's been too long.

920
01:00:42.256 --> 01:00:44.090
Good to see you. Gus.

921
01:00:44.090 --> 01:00:45.188
Apple.

922
01:00:46.894 --> 01:00:49.665
This is Kamp Billy.
the Prince of Fernando Po.

923
01:00:50.628 --> 01:00:51.933
Your Highness.

924
01:00:52.235 --> 01:00:53.427
He's agreed to help us.

925
01:00:54.731 --> 01:00:57.100
Forgive me. but...

926
01:00:57.100 --> 01:01:01.071
I have a peculiar feeling
that we've met before.

927
01:01:01.071 --> 01:01:04.744
I get that a lot.
I'm extremely well-traveled.

928
01:01:04.744 --> 01:01:07.144
No. no.
It's a particular sense.

929
01:01:09.949 --> 01:01:13.317
I don't suppose
you played cricket. did you?

930
01:01:15.523 --> 01:01:18.192
Captained Eton. '21 to '22.

931
01:01:18.294 --> 01:01:20.526
I knew I knew your face!

932
01:01:20.629 --> 01:01:22.528
Right next
to the trophy cabinet.

933
01:01:22.631 --> 01:01:25.298
An eight-foot-tall
huge portrait.

934
01:01:25.298 --> 01:01:28.203
Yes. exactly that!

935
01:01:28.305 --> 01:01:29.567
One eye on the boundary...

936
01:01:29.669 --> 01:01:31.162
...one eye on the pub.

937
01:01:31.264 --> 01:01:32.738
Bloody glad to have you aboard.

938
01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:34.336
Bloody good
to be here. old boy.

939
01:01:35.035 --> 01:01:36.810
I'm very bored

940
01:01:36.810 --> 01:01:38.809
with these Nazis making
a nuisance of themselves.

941
01:01:38.809 --> 01:01:40.346
I mean.
it's terrible for business.

942
01:01:40.448 --> 01:01:42.176
I'm only too pleased

943
01:01:42.278 --> 01:01:45.353
to help you
serve them a bloody nose.

944
01:01:45.353 --> 01:01:47.145
That's a commendable attitude.

945
01:01:47.145 --> 01:01:48.923
So. what's your plan?

946
01:01:49.025 --> 01:01:50.055
Apple.

947
01:01:51.561 --> 01:01:52.423
We're going
to sink the <i>Duchessa.</i>

948
01:01:52.525 --> 01:01:54.189
plus the two tugs.

949
01:01:54.291 --> 01:01:56.360
Crippling Hitler's
Atlantic fleet of U-boats.

950
01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:57.895
Very good.

951
01:01:57.997 --> 01:02:00.368
The thing is.
our old friends the Nazis

952
01:02:00.368 --> 01:02:01.833
aren't making it the easiest.

953
01:02:01.833 --> 01:02:04.067
We're outnumbered
two hundred to five.

954
01:02:04.170 --> 01:02:05.741
There's a few more soldiers
than we anticipated.

955
01:02:06.970 --> 01:02:08.170
I think that we're gonna have

956
01:02:08.170 --> 01:02:10.207
to find ourselves
a few more strapping lads.

957
01:02:11.047 --> 01:02:12.278
Ade...

958
01:02:22.325 --> 01:02:23.715
Right...

959
01:02:27.691 --> 01:02:28.896
Yes. I think that will do.

960
01:02:30.534 --> 01:02:32.864
We brought some weapons
if you need.

961
01:02:32.864 --> 01:02:35.059
You hold onto those.
We brought our own.

962
01:02:37.938 --> 01:02:40.275
Oyah!
Show them the iron!

963
01:02:43.236 --> 01:02:44.942
Marvelous.

964
01:02:44.942 --> 01:02:46.471
You do know
the <i>Duchessa</i> is

965
01:02:46.573 --> 01:02:48.880
more than 200 feet
from the harbor side?

966
01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:51.484
And she's in full glare
of the lights.

967
01:02:51.586 --> 01:02:53.412
She's not gonna be easy to sink

968
01:02:53.412 --> 01:02:55.480
without attracting
unwanted attention.

969
01:02:55.582 --> 01:02:58.824
Yes. That's why Heron
will plant a bomb

970
01:02:58.926 --> 01:03:01.220
to blow the lights.
before we paddle in

971
01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:04.092
and rig the hull
with explosives.

972
01:03:04.194 --> 01:03:06.465
By the time
the explosives detonate.

973
01:03:06.567 --> 01:03:07.768
we'll be heading home.

974
01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:09.933
If I had it my way.
a shot'll never be fired.

975
01:03:10.035 --> 01:03:12.505
And how often
do you have it your way?

976
01:03:12.607 --> 01:03:14.506
Depends on who you ask. old boy.

977
01:03:16.741 --> 01:03:17.839
Gentlemen...

978
01:03:17.839 --> 01:03:19.274
- Ade.
- Chief.

979
01:03:19.376 --> 01:03:21.342
- Prepare the men.

980
01:03:21.445 --> 01:03:23.412
I'll take that 20
whenever you're ready. Freddy.

981
01:03:42.268 --> 01:03:43.795
The <i>Duchessa</i>
will be gone by the morning.

982
01:03:45.004 --> 01:03:46.369
- Can you manage that?

983
01:03:48.478 --> 01:03:50.802
It's two wires and a tick-tock.

984
01:03:52.107 --> 01:03:53.508
I'm sure I can cope.

985
01:03:55.279 --> 01:03:57.182
It's not me you should be
worried about.

986
01:03:59.788 --> 01:04:01.813
I've never
taken a Nazi to a party.

987
01:04:04.959 --> 01:04:07.621
Just don't end up
at one of his parties.

988
01:04:11.698 --> 01:04:12.824
Don't worry about me.

989
01:04:14.099 --> 01:04:15.904
I'm gonna have
my own little party.

990
01:04:21.274 --> 01:04:23.142
Drink for the boys.
on His Majesty's government.

991
01:04:28.047 --> 01:04:30.983
Ordinarily.
I'd bite your hand off.

992
01:04:30.983 --> 01:04:33.321
as I have been known
to love a pound note.

993
01:04:37.152 --> 01:04:38.223
But on this occasion.

994
01:04:40.628 --> 01:04:41.853
the drinks are on me.

995
01:04:43.232 --> 01:04:44.658
However.

996
01:04:44.658 --> 01:04:46.902
if His Majesty's government
was handing out titles...

997
01:04:48.033 --> 01:04:50.001
You're already a prince.
old boy.

998
01:04:50.001 --> 01:04:53.369
There's Prince
of Fernando Po. but...

999
01:04:53.471 --> 01:04:56.241
a Knight of the Realm
has a certain antiquity to it.

1000
01:04:58.877 --> 01:05:01.114
Arise. Sir Kamp Billy.

1001
01:05:03.585 --> 01:05:04.876
You're a good man. Gus.

1002
01:05:05.916 --> 01:05:06.878
Good luck. Billy.

1003
01:05:17.497 --> 01:05:18.725
<i>Hola!</i>

1004
01:05:20.196 --> 01:05:21.970
<i>Buenas tardes. companeros!</i>

1005
01:06:59.392 --> 01:07:00.992
My <i>Herr.</i> you have a visitor.

1006
01:07:04.373 --> 01:07:05.832
Ta-da!

1007
01:07:10.707 --> 01:07:13.004
Cleopatra needs her Caesar.

1008
01:07:13.548 --> 01:07:14.577
Put it on.

1009
01:07:18.277 --> 01:07:19.318
Thank you. Timothy.

1010
01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:21.188
One second.

1011
01:07:21.853 --> 01:07:22.882
Timothy...

1012
01:07:24.693 --> 01:07:26.551
I have a counter offer.

1013
01:07:26.654 --> 01:07:28.929
Let's put
this dressing up aside.

1014
01:07:29.031 --> 01:07:31.660
It's for children.
And we are not children.

1015
01:07:34.968 --> 01:07:36.236
Let's make our own party.

1016
01:07:37.474 --> 01:07:38.667
A dark party.

1017
01:07:39.641 --> 01:07:42.944
A dark Nazi party.

1018
01:07:42.944 --> 01:07:47.214
With music. lubrication
and a handsome Nazi.

1019
01:07:48.651 --> 01:07:50.018
Since I've been here.

1020
01:07:50.018 --> 01:07:53.218
I've been bitten by things
that croak and slither.

1021
01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:55.319
scorpions nest in my boots
and I can't sleep

1022
01:07:55.319 --> 01:07:57.356
for the relentless howl
of jungle entropy.

1023
01:07:58.053 --> 01:07:59.323
Tonight.

1024
01:07:59.323 --> 01:08:03.362
I'm going to that party.
and you are taking me.

1025
01:08:05.095 --> 01:08:07.135
Now. put it on.

1026
01:08:08.572 --> 01:08:09.368
Oh.

1027
01:08:10.704 --> 01:08:11.968
Very well.

1028
01:08:52.109 --> 01:08:53.610
Ah! <i>Hola!</i>

1029
01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:10.262
We move when the lights go out.

1030
01:09:27.783 --> 01:09:29.140
All right. Ricardo.

1031
01:09:30.544 --> 01:09:33.281
today you're <i>El Capitan.</i>

1032
01:09:33.281 --> 01:09:36.824
Armando. the bar is yours.

1033
01:09:36.824 --> 01:09:39.059
Use it. Abuse it at your will.

1034
01:09:39.161 --> 01:09:41.860
That's why I love you.

1035
01:09:41.962 --> 01:09:43.664
Come with me. handsome.

1036
01:09:47.532 --> 01:09:49.204
I need you
to keep the men happy.

1037
01:09:51.706 --> 01:09:52.735
How happy?

1038
01:10:11.386 --> 01:10:12.183
Mmm.

1039
01:10:14.963 --> 01:10:17.462
Are the rats in the nest?

1040
01:10:17.462 --> 01:10:21.064
You won't find a German.
Spanish or Italian officer

1041
01:10:21.166 --> 01:10:22.498
anywhere else tonight.

1042
01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:29.909
Between the beer fest
at the harbor

1043
01:10:30.011 --> 01:10:31.675
and this little get-together.

1044
01:10:31.675 --> 01:10:34.040
that'll be 90% of the soldiers
away from the dock.

1045
01:10:35.581 --> 01:10:37.551
The charge is set
to blow the harbor lights

1046
01:10:37.654 --> 01:10:38.418
in 30 minutes.

1047
01:10:40.186 --> 01:10:42.552
Can you keep him here that long?

1048
01:10:42.654 --> 01:10:45.216
Silly boy. silly question.
Look at the dress.

1049
01:10:55.736 --> 01:10:56.771
Hi.

1050
01:10:56.873 --> 01:10:59.031
So. you call this a party?

1051
01:10:59.031 --> 01:11:00.702
This is just
the thin end of the wedge.

1052
01:11:00.702 --> 01:11:03.308
I've created a performance
just for you.

1053
01:11:03.308 --> 01:11:06.109
Well. I could show you
a real party.

1054
01:11:33.539 --> 01:11:34.772
Why do I care. Spaghetti?

1055
01:11:34.874 --> 01:11:37.077
Pizza.

1056
01:11:37.077 --> 01:11:39.177
Excuse me
while I powder my nose.

1057
01:11:39.177 --> 01:11:41.072
- What. again?

1058
01:11:41.072 --> 01:11:43.544
Don't panic. Caesar.
Brush up on your Italian.

1059
01:11:43.544 --> 01:11:46.186
Your gift needs to be wrapped.

1060
01:11:46.186 --> 01:11:48.089
Keep those officers
drinking. please.

1061
01:11:48.089 --> 01:11:50.081
- Of course. Okay.
- Thank you. Femi.

1062
01:11:50.081 --> 01:11:51.953
The <i>Duchessa's</i> hull
has been reinforced.

1063
01:11:52.993 --> 01:11:53.790
It won't sink.

1064
01:11:55.096 --> 01:11:56.358
We need to stop the mission.

1065
01:12:03.104 --> 01:12:04.431
That's going to be hard to do.

1066
01:12:04.431 --> 01:12:06.037
Listen to me.

1067
01:12:06.139 --> 01:12:07.435
Our mission will fail.

1068
01:12:07.435 --> 01:12:08.737
The explosives won't work

1069
01:12:08.737 --> 01:12:11.302
because he's reinforced it
to be unsinkable.

1070
01:12:13.015 --> 01:12:14.008
You have to stop them now.

1071
01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:19.984
But the charge is about
to blow the lights.

1072
01:12:21.979 --> 01:12:23.052
Well. if you can't
stop the lights.

1073
01:12:23.155 --> 01:12:24.188
stop the men.

1074
01:12:24.290 --> 01:12:26.020
Luhr must not leave this party.

1075
01:12:27.128 --> 01:12:28.957
I'll keep him busy. Go. now.

1076
01:13:08.531 --> 01:13:10.068
And we're off.

1077
01:13:10.170 --> 01:13:11.432
Gus. wait.

1078
01:13:31.227 --> 01:13:33.560
Stork to Maid.
Stork to Maid. come in.

1079
01:13:35.029 --> 01:13:36.286
Channel five.

1080
01:13:36.286 --> 01:13:37.388
<i>This is Maid. Switching to 20.</i>

1081
01:13:40.561 --> 01:13:42.136
<i>Go ahead.</i>

1082
01:13:42.238 --> 01:13:44.263
Tin of corned beef
can't be cracked.

1083
01:13:45.206 --> 01:13:46.606
<i>The ship cannot be sunk.</i>

1084
01:13:47.570 --> 01:13:49.235
<i>Explosives will fail.</i>

1085
01:13:50.275 --> 01:13:51.869
It's Stork. sir.

1086
01:13:51.869 --> 01:13:52.876
Put him on open speaker.

1087
01:13:54.207 --> 01:13:55.978
<i>Corned beef
can't be cracked.</i>

1088
01:13:56.611 --> 01:13:57.911
Stork. this is M.

1089
01:13:58.013 --> 01:13:59.977
Never mind the corned beef.
Just find a way.

1090
01:14:00.079 --> 01:14:02.179
- Over.
- Pound incoming. sir.

1091
01:14:02.179 --> 01:14:03.487
-<i>Repeat...</i>
- Switch that off.

1092
01:14:03.487 --> 01:14:04.459
<i>- We must...</i>

1093
01:14:06.193 --> 01:14:08.391
Stop this immediately.

1094
01:14:08.391 --> 01:14:11.432
What you are doing ends now.

1095
01:14:11.534 --> 01:14:13.724
or every last one of you
will be subject to a tribunal.

1096
01:14:13.724 --> 01:14:15.567
Is that clear?

1097
01:14:15.567 --> 01:14:17.604
I don't know what
you're talking about. sir.

1098
01:14:19.042 --> 01:14:21.432
Is that correct. Sergeant?

1099
01:14:25.314 --> 01:14:26.541
<i>Hold position.</i>

1100
01:14:26.541 --> 01:14:28.843
<i>How long. Stork?</i>

1101
01:14:28.843 --> 01:14:29.917
-<i>Awaiting orders.</i>
- Give me that.

1102
01:14:29.917 --> 01:14:30.815
<i>Stand by.</i>

1103
01:14:31.954 --> 01:14:33.344
March-Phillips.

1104
01:14:33.344 --> 01:14:36.187
this is Admiral Pound
giving you a direct order.

1105
01:14:36.289 --> 01:14:37.918
Abort this mission now.

1106
01:14:37.918 --> 01:14:39.118
<i>I will make sure that</i>

1107
01:14:39.118 --> 01:14:41.053
<i>none of you see
the light of day again.</i>

1108
01:14:41.053 --> 01:14:42.527
<i>You will spend
the rest of your lives</i>

1109
01:14:42.527 --> 01:14:44.428
<i>locked up
at His Majesty's pleasure.</i>

1110
01:14:44.428 --> 01:14:45.296
<i>That includes all of you.</i>

1111
01:14:45.296 --> 01:14:47.131
<i>Geoffrey Appleyard.</i>

1112
01:14:47.131 --> 01:14:48.302
<i>Anders Lassen.</i>

1113
01:14:48.302 --> 01:14:49.300
<i>- Freddy Buzz...</i>
-I'm sorry...

1114
01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:50.531
<i>...and Henry Hayes.</i>

1115
01:14:50.531 --> 01:14:51.801
Can't quite make out

1116
01:14:51.903 --> 01:14:52.969
- what you're saying.

1117
01:14:54.469 --> 01:14:56.036
Bye.

1118
01:14:56.138 --> 01:14:57.340
- Is... Is that clear?

1119
01:14:57.340 --> 01:14:59.038
<i>Sorry? What?</i>

1120
01:14:59.038 --> 01:15:00.914
<i>I can't...
I can't quite hear you.</i>

1121
01:15:01.939 --> 01:15:03.474
<i>Please... fuck off.</i>

1122
01:15:08.755 --> 01:15:11.152
You and your operation
are reckless. Brigadier.

1123
01:15:12.427 --> 01:15:14.220
I will personally
advise parliament

1124
01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:17.394
to have the Prime Minister
removed from office.

1125
01:15:17.496 --> 01:15:19.127
And I am going to shut you down.

1126
01:15:20.534 --> 01:15:23.362
Message received
loud and clear. sir.

1127
01:15:30.006 --> 01:15:32.806
I suggest you also
fuck off. Sergeant.

1128
01:15:32.806 --> 01:15:34.505
Fleming. contact March-Phillips.

1129
01:15:38.949 --> 01:15:40.552
Lily. get me
the Prime Minister on hotline.

1130
01:15:40.552 --> 01:15:41.846
-<i>Right away. sir.</i>
- Come in. 01.

1131
01:15:41.948 --> 01:15:43.254
Come in. do you receive?

1132
01:15:48.330 --> 01:15:49.858
- Yes?
-<i>Prime Minister.</i>

1133
01:15:49.858 --> 01:15:51.522
<i>I'm afraid
we've been discovered.</i>

1134
01:15:54.432 --> 01:15:55.827
There was a mole in our midst

1135
01:15:55.827 --> 01:15:57.062
and Admiral Pound

1136
01:15:57.164 --> 01:15:58.969
has ordered the mission
to be aborted.

1137
01:15:58.969 --> 01:16:01.532
<i>He wants to have parliament
remove you from office.</i>

1138
01:16:02.673 --> 01:16:04.001
The mission must continue.

1139
01:16:04.001 --> 01:16:05.644
01. this is base. Over.

1140
01:16:05.644 --> 01:16:07.008
<i>Tell Pound
if he has a problem.</i>

1141
01:16:07.008 --> 01:16:09.150
<i>to take it up with me.
He knows where I live.</i>

1142
01:16:09.150 --> 01:16:10.880
<i>Tell the men to press on.</i>

1143
01:16:10.982 --> 01:16:13.214
I'm afraid we've lost
all communication. sir.

1144
01:16:16.822 --> 01:16:18.292
There must be
something that we can do.

1145
01:16:18.394 --> 01:16:21.261
The only thing
I can do is remind you.

1146
01:16:21.364 --> 01:16:23.463
the reason
we chose March-Phillips

1147
01:16:23.463 --> 01:16:25.798
<i>is because
he doesn't follow orders.</i>

1148
01:16:28.831 --> 01:16:30.363
Then let's hope we chose well.

1149
01:16:35.368 --> 01:16:38.068
The <i>Duchessa's</i> hull
has been reinforced.

1150
01:16:38.170 --> 01:16:40.044
Which means she can't be sunk.

1151
01:16:40.044 --> 01:16:43.375
At least not with the amount
of explosives we're carrying.

1152
01:16:43.375 --> 01:16:45.717
Just wondering how and when
exactly this took place.

1153
01:16:45.717 --> 01:16:47.585
It's not important
how and when. it's happened.

1154
01:16:47.687 --> 01:16:49.654
Well. it is
kind of important. Gus.

1155
01:16:49.654 --> 01:16:51.757
I don't care
about the prison time.

1156
01:16:51.859 --> 01:16:53.654
but I do care about finishing
what we've started.

1157
01:16:53.654 --> 01:16:55.022
Thank you. Freddy.

1158
01:16:55.022 --> 01:16:56.130
There must be
some sort of mistake.

1159
01:16:56.232 --> 01:16:57.264
You can't just reinforce...

1160
01:16:57.264 --> 01:16:59.092
There's no mistake. Haysey.

1161
01:16:59.194 --> 01:17:00.860
I'm just lost about
how and when exactly...

1162
01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:02.098
- Enough!

1163
01:17:10.708 --> 01:17:12.108
Why don't we sink the tug boats?

1164
01:17:13.647 --> 01:17:15.078
Get rid of the shuttle
to the U-boats.

1165
01:17:16.382 --> 01:17:18.108
It's not enough.

1166
01:17:18.210 --> 01:17:19.181
They'll replace them in a week.

1167
01:17:29.396 --> 01:17:30.493
Why don't we steal them?

1168
01:17:30.595 --> 01:17:31.895
We can use Billy's boat

1169
01:17:31.895 --> 01:17:33.731
to drag the <i>Duchessa</i>
out of the harbor

1170
01:17:33.731 --> 01:17:35.301
and steal the other two
German tug boats

1171
01:17:35.301 --> 01:17:36.634
that service the U-boats.

1172
01:17:36.736 --> 01:17:38.530
And how are
we supposed to do that?

1173
01:17:38.530 --> 01:17:42.137
Not only is she double-plated.
weighing twice as much.

1174
01:17:42.239 --> 01:17:43.936
but you'd need a full crew
to move a ship that size.

1175
01:17:43.936 --> 01:17:45.677
The tug boats are the crew.

1176
01:17:45.677 --> 01:17:47.341
We tow the <i>Duchessa</i>
out to the ocean

1177
01:17:48.515 --> 01:17:50.715
and. well. steal the lot.

1178
01:17:50.715 --> 01:17:53.314
Then what?
We still can't sink them.

1179
01:17:54.453 --> 01:17:55.785
We don't need to.

1180
01:17:55.785 --> 01:17:57.381
We sail
into international waters

1181
01:17:57.483 --> 01:17:58.951
and hand everything
over to the Navy.

1182
01:17:58.951 --> 01:18:00.319
They're following us anyway.

1183
01:18:00.319 --> 01:18:01.492
so they'll be more than happy
to see us again.

1184
01:18:01.492 --> 01:18:03.027
And what about the anchor?

1185
01:18:04.366 --> 01:18:05.565
Have you seen the size of it?

1186
01:18:05.667 --> 01:18:07.457
If we're gonna
actually start to move her.

1187
01:18:07.457 --> 01:18:09.533
their S-boats
will catch us in seconds.

1188
01:18:09.635 --> 01:18:10.901
Well. what are you going to do

1189
01:18:10.901 --> 01:18:12.036
with all the explosives
you brought. Freddy?

1190
01:18:13.971 --> 01:18:15.906
We'll use them
to blow the anchor.

1191
01:18:15.906 --> 01:18:18.238
We'll rig the S-boats
so they can't follow.

1192
01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:20.412
rig the fuel reserve
that supplies the U-boats.

1193
01:18:20.514 --> 01:18:24.176
and then. well. blow the lot up.

1194
01:18:24.278 --> 01:18:25.850
That fuel explosion's
gonna bring

1195
01:18:25.952 --> 01:18:27.419
everyone and their mother
down to the harbor.

1196
01:18:27.521 --> 01:18:29.153
We set the fuse.

1197
01:18:29.153 --> 01:18:31.588
so that the fuel dump blows
once we're outside the harbor.

1198
01:18:31.690 --> 01:18:34.091
Then we sneak out quietly.

1199
01:18:35.723 --> 01:18:36.687
Not bad.

1200
01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:39.998
It's very greedy.

1201
01:18:41.866 --> 01:18:44.431
- Well. I'm in.
-Well.

1202
01:18:44.533 --> 01:18:47.772
I'm not leaving until I have
a barrel full of Nazi hearts.

1203
01:18:47.772 --> 01:18:49.876
I'll do whatever
you tell me to do. sir.

1204
01:18:52.576 --> 01:18:53.605
Gentlemen.

1205
01:18:58.716 --> 01:19:00.216
let's steal some boats.

1206
01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:12.723
Turns out she's double-plated.
so change of plans.

1207
01:19:14.593 --> 01:19:16.233
We're going
to steal the boats instead.

1208
01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:20.731
Is that even possible?

1209
01:19:22.575 --> 01:19:23.734
I'm not entirely sure.

1210
01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:28.112
But if you're up for it.
so are we.

1211
01:19:29.374 --> 01:19:30.444
And you know what that means.

1212
01:19:31.950 --> 01:19:34.454
A lot more blood
and a lot more sweat.

1213
01:19:34.557 --> 01:19:36.153
Hopefully not any of ours.
old boy.

1214
01:19:38.388 --> 01:19:40.322
I don't think we can do this
without you. Billy.

1215
01:19:49.702 --> 01:19:52.169
Well. I'm up for it if you are.

1216
01:19:54.401 --> 01:19:55.737
I think we're gonna
need your tug.

1217
01:19:58.914 --> 01:20:00.845
Haysey and I will
take a stroll along the harbor

1218
01:20:00.947 --> 01:20:03.749
and take out
any soldiers still patrolling.

1219
01:20:03.749 --> 01:20:05.484
Freddy will bring
his dinghy around

1220
01:20:05.586 --> 01:20:06.750
and take care of the S-boats.

1221
01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:07.855
We'll meet you by the tug boats.

1222
01:20:09.448 --> 01:20:10.752
And the <i>Duchessa?</i>

1223
01:20:10.752 --> 01:20:12.319
That's Apple and me.

1224
01:20:12.422 --> 01:20:14.891
We'll take care of any crew
and blow the anchor.

1225
01:20:14.891 --> 01:20:16.094
And destroy their comms.

1226
01:20:17.996 --> 01:20:20.062
Not sure
what you'll meet on board.

1227
01:20:20.062 --> 01:20:22.533
Take my top boy
and two more of my men.

1228
01:20:24.638 --> 01:20:26.467

Haysey...

Up there
on the left. sir.

1253
01:23:49.169 --> 01:23:50.668
Yes.

1254
01:23:53.878 --> 01:23:54.911
He made a crash!

1255
01:24:09.990 --> 01:24:12.330

Papers please.

1259
01:25:29.074 --> 01:25:30.841
- Commander.
- All good. Freddy?

1260
01:25:30.943 --> 01:25:32.241
Charges are set to go

1261
01:25:32.241 --> 01:25:33.103
once we're out
of the harbor. sir.

1262
01:25:34.914 --> 01:25:36.440
Let's carry on then.

1263
01:25:51.758 --> 01:25:53.123
Did you enjoy your gift?

1264
01:25:53.965 --> 01:25:54.993
Mmm.

1265
01:25:57.299 --> 01:26:00.303
I think now it's time

1266
01:26:00.405 --> 01:26:04.134
that the fox shows his den
to the vixen.

1267
01:26:38.772 --> 01:26:41.006
Heron. why are
the lights still on?

1268
01:26:42.378 --> 01:26:43.842
I lit the room with oil lamps.

1269
01:26:43.842 --> 01:26:45.549
so they wouldn't notice
when the power went out.

1270
01:27:28.124 --> 01:27:29.428
- Look out!

1271
01:27:47.343 --> 01:27:48.740
Freddy. rig this 88.

1272
01:27:48.842 --> 01:27:50.240
then take the first tug
with Haysey.

1273
01:27:54.055 --> 01:27:55.887
<i>- Gute nacht.
- Guten abend.</i>

1274
01:28:00.993 --> 01:28:02.458
<i>Guten abend.</i>

1275
01:28:28.454 --> 01:28:29.617
Terribly sorry. old boy.

1276
01:28:29.719 --> 01:28:31.190
- Do you mind? I seem to...

1277
01:28:31.190 --> 01:28:33.560
- ...have misplaced my knife.

1278
01:29:37.959 --> 01:29:39.349
- Bugger!

1279
01:29:46.791 --> 01:29:47.566
Thank you. Billy.

1280
01:29:56.208 --> 01:29:58.274
- Oh!

1281
01:30:54.467 --> 01:30:56.129
I hope that's
not your blood. Lassen.

1282
01:30:57.235 --> 01:30:58.896
I hope so too.

1283
01:31:05.275 --> 01:31:06.871
Okay. boys. cast off.

1284
01:31:06.871 --> 01:31:07.943
Let's get this ship out of here.

1285
01:31:15.915 --> 01:31:19.317
Go on. Go on...

1286
01:31:19.794 --> 01:31:21.253
Go on!

1287
01:31:25.127 --> 01:31:27.963
There's three
more rooms just like this one.

1288
01:31:27.963 --> 01:31:30.130
That should stop the U-boats
for the next six months.

1289
01:31:31.967 --> 01:31:33.369
Let's get this thing
towed out of here.

1290
01:31:33.369 --> 01:31:34.997
We are here. boys.

1291
01:31:35.099 --> 01:31:36.675
Quietly. Let's set a warning.

1292
01:31:42.845 --> 01:31:44.009
I need you to go
to the front of the boat

1293
01:31:44.009 --> 01:31:45.977
and attach the <i>Vulcan</i>
to the <i>Duchessa.</i>

1294
01:31:46.079 --> 01:31:47.283
Lassen and I
will head to the bridge.

1295
01:31:47.283 --> 01:31:49.149
Okay.

1296
01:31:50.754 --> 01:31:52.790
Take the right side.

1297
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:54.385
And you. get up there
and get this thing started.

1298
01:32:06.974 --> 01:32:08.003
It's Gus.

1299
01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:10.544
Everyone's in place.

1300
01:32:13.606 --> 01:32:14.976
What.

1301
01:32:14.976 --> 01:32:16.715
you didn't actually think
it would work. did you?

1302
01:32:17.986 --> 01:32:18.882
It was your plan.

1303
01:32:20.011 --> 01:32:21.043
Well. let's make sure

1304
01:32:21.145 --> 01:32:22.947
we keep our end of the bargain.

1305
01:32:22.947 --> 01:32:24.415
Signal back and I'll heave off.

1306
01:32:27.128 --> 01:32:28.790
So. what happens now?

1307
01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:30.427
We wait for
the anchor chain to blow.

1308
01:32:30.530 --> 01:32:32.265
When do
we expect that to happen?

1309
01:32:32.367 --> 01:32:34.332
- Shortly. I hope.

1310
01:32:34.332 --> 01:32:36.626
And then we're free to take her.

1311
01:32:36.626 --> 01:32:41.102
However. the real race begins
once the fuel depot goes.

1312
01:32:41.204 --> 01:32:43.434
Then we'll have every soldier
on the island turning up.

1313
01:32:45.678 --> 01:32:47.779
We don't wanna
be around to witness that.

1314
01:32:49.348 --> 01:32:50.646
How long was that fuse

1315
01:32:50.646 --> 01:32:51.750
you attached
to the anchor chain?

1316
01:32:53.221 --> 01:32:54.218
We'll find out soon enough.

1317
01:32:56.020 --> 01:32:57.255
Wait for it.
you're gonna catch the rope.

1318
01:33:08.694 --> 01:33:09.559
Come on.

1319
01:33:29.619 --> 01:33:30.954
First domino falls.

1320
01:33:32.890 --> 01:33:34.290
- Hitch up the other line.
- Yes. boss.

1321
01:33:34.392 --> 01:33:35.420
Pick up the slack.

1322
01:33:37.722 --> 01:33:39.831
They need to move her
before the fuel dump blows.

1323
01:33:41.433 --> 01:33:42.893
Heron. we need Marjorie.

1324
01:33:42.893 --> 01:33:44.928
Leave Marjorie to me.

1325
01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:46.167
We'll catch you up.

1326
01:33:47.041 --> 01:33:48.070
Very good.

1327
01:33:48.768 --> 01:33:50.075
Let's go!

1328
01:34:34.412 --> 01:34:35.953
I have to say. <i>Fraulein.</i>

1329
01:34:38.621 --> 01:34:39.649
you were good.

1330
01:34:41.085 --> 01:34:42.652
And you were sly.

1331
01:34:43.861 --> 01:34:45.561
There are only
two types of people

1332
01:34:45.663 --> 01:34:47.657
that are as sly as the fox.

1333
01:34:48.828 --> 01:34:49.659
The German

1334
01:34:51.138 --> 01:34:52.464
and the Jew.

1335
01:34:55.540 --> 01:34:59.537
And you are not German.

1336
01:35:00.710 --> 01:35:02.344
I think now it's time...

1337
01:35:04.509 --> 01:35:06.348
- ...for a real party.

1338
01:35:17.125 --> 01:35:19.224
That wasn't
supposed to happen yet.

1339
01:35:23.962 --> 01:35:25.101
Shackle her!

1340
01:35:25.998 --> 01:35:26.773
And follow me.

1341
01:35:30.576 --> 01:35:32.178
The harbor is under attack!

1342
01:35:52.498 --> 01:35:53.525
They're coming.

1343
01:35:58.604 --> 01:35:59.905
We need power on the engine.

1344
01:36:04.536 --> 01:36:06.736
- She's too heavy!
- Pick up the slack!

1345
01:36:18.624 --> 01:36:20.050
Wait...

1346
01:36:24.190 --> 01:36:24.996
She's not moving!

1347
01:36:26.731 --> 01:36:29.300
Fire! Fire! Fire!

1348
01:36:29.402 --> 01:36:30.267
Wait for it.

1349
01:36:51.417 --> 01:36:53.217
We need
more power on the engine.

1350
01:36:53.217 --> 01:36:55.691
Give me more power! More power!

1351
01:36:57.222 --> 01:36:58.590
That's it. it's working!

1352
01:36:59.731 --> 01:37:00.698
- That's it!

1353
01:37:27.924 --> 01:37:28.895
Ready!

1354
01:37:50.508 --> 01:37:51.885
-  Haysey!

1355
01:38:52.008 --> 01:38:53.705
We're out of range now.

1356
01:38:55.607 --> 01:38:57.115
- I'm no expert.

1357
01:38:57.217 --> 01:38:59.650
But you've got a big old hole
in your shoulder. Haysey.

1358
01:39:47.766 --> 01:39:49.396
Captain.

1359
01:39:49.396 --> 01:39:51.664
would you explain to me
what's going on here?

1360
01:39:52.902 --> 01:39:54.872
The power is gone.

1361
01:39:54.974 --> 01:39:57.302
The fuel depot
has been sabotaged.

1362
01:39:57.405 --> 01:39:58.477
And no one knows
what's happening.

1363
01:39:58.579 --> 01:39:59.675
But this is your fault.

1364
01:39:59.777 --> 01:40:01.014
Where is my ship?

1365
01:40:02.948 --> 01:40:04.543
The <i>Duchessa.</i> where did it go?

1366
01:40:04.645 --> 01:40:06.811
Someone's taken him
while you weren't looking.

1367
01:40:07.850 --> 01:40:09.281
You idiot!

1368
01:40:09.281 --> 01:40:10.820
You always have to say something

1369
01:40:10.820 --> 01:40:12.652
at the very wrong time.

1370
01:40:13.927 --> 01:40:16.557
There is never
a right time with you!

1371
01:40:17.632 --> 01:40:18.897
Your greed and perversion

1372
01:40:18.897 --> 01:40:20.962
has distracted you
from your duties.

1373
01:40:20.962 --> 01:40:22.732
Now my harbor is destroyed.

1374
01:40:22.834 --> 01:40:24.169
And my ship is gone!

1375
01:40:28.007 --> 01:40:30.839
And now you're gone too.
Thank you.

1376
01:40:59.035 --> 01:41:00.029
Impressive.

1377
01:41:03.142 --> 01:41:04.267
Sounds like
your detonators worked.

1378
01:41:41.506 --> 01:41:43.611
<i>Chapeau. mademoiselle.</i>

1379
01:41:43.713 --> 01:41:46.944
You play well.
You really are the vixen.

1380
01:41:48.279 --> 01:41:49.078
Am I?

1381
01:41:51.088 --> 01:41:52.752
Well. my hand's been revealed.

1382
01:41:56.564 --> 01:41:58.795
So. what now?

1383
01:41:58.897 --> 01:42:02.792
Now. I possess your hand

1384
01:42:02.894 --> 01:42:04.896
and for everything
you have done to me.

1385
01:42:06.370 --> 01:42:09.639
I will visit
a thousand fold upon you.

1386
01:42:16.914 --> 01:42:17.942
Yeah.

1387
01:42:25.316 --> 01:42:26.115
But no.

1388
01:42:40.005 --> 01:42:41.438
- Lie down.

1389
01:42:45.241 --> 01:42:48.137
Gus. we can't wait much longer.

1390
01:42:51.751 --> 01:42:52.847
They're coming.

1391
01:42:52.950 --> 01:42:54.479
If we stay here.

1392
01:42:54.582 --> 01:42:56.622
we'll lose contact
with the others.

1393
01:42:56.622 --> 01:42:58.585
Hold fast. Billy.

1394
01:42:58.585 --> 01:43:01.221
Heron has a way of surviving
and Marjorie.

1395
01:43:01.323 --> 01:43:03.988
well... good luck with that.

1396
01:43:09.301 --> 01:43:11.061
That's a patrol boat
coming towards us.

1397
01:43:15.604 --> 01:43:17.166
- Gus. we need to leave. Now.

1398
01:43:18.436 --> 01:43:19.575
Hold on...

1399
01:43:31.988 --> 01:43:33.017
It's them.

1400
01:43:34.453 --> 01:43:35.855
RH.

1401
01:43:36.995 --> 01:43:39.164
- KB.
-Marjorie.

1402
01:43:39.164 --> 01:43:41.432
Overdressed and underdressed
at the same time.

1403
01:43:44.469 --> 01:43:46.195
Come on. let's get you
out of those shackles.

1404
01:43:51.776 --> 01:43:53.977
Come in. <i>Violet.</i>

1405
01:43:53.977 --> 01:43:55.204
Calling <i>H.M.S. Violet.</i>

1406
01:43:56.817 --> 01:43:58.040
<i>Come in.</i> Violet.

1407
01:43:58.040 --> 01:43:59.378
<i>This is</i> Maid Honor.

1408
01:43:59.378 --> 01:44:00.385
Go ahead. <i>Maid Honor.</i>

1409
01:44:01.416 --> 01:44:03.378
- Loudspeaker.

1410
01:44:03.378 --> 01:44:04.948
<i>Sorry to bother you
at this time of the night.</i>

1411
01:44:05.051 --> 01:44:06.652
but we've found ourselves
with one or two items

1412
01:44:06.652 --> 01:44:07.524
that might be
of interest to you.

1413
01:44:09.163 --> 01:44:10.593
<i>Shall we rendezvous
for a handover?</i>

1414
01:44:12.195 --> 01:44:13.658
Get me Admiral Pound.

1415
01:44:23.371 --> 01:44:25.002
- Yes?
<i>Sir.</i>

1416
01:44:25.002 --> 01:44:27.308
<i>- good news and bad news.</i>
- Yes. yes. Get to it.

1417
01:44:27.308 --> 01:44:29.040
<i>Bad news. they didn't sink her.</i>

1418
01:44:29.848 --> 01:44:30.910
<i>Good news.</i>

1419
01:44:31.686 --> 01:44:32.615
<i>they stole her.</i>

1420
01:44:34.119 --> 01:44:36.384
Congratulations. Prime Minister.

1421
01:45:04.577 --> 01:45:05.450
Hold it there!

1422
01:45:06.753 --> 01:45:08.019
Commander.

1423
01:45:08.121 --> 01:45:09.579
You were ordered
by Admiral Pound

1424
01:45:09.579 --> 01:45:10.722
to cease activities.

1425
01:45:10.722 --> 01:45:12.752
You did not.

1426
01:45:12.752 --> 01:45:14.254
Therefore. you are
to be returned to England

1427
01:45:14.254 --> 01:45:16.822
to face a tribunal. You.

1428
01:45:16.925 --> 01:45:20.264
Return to your tug
with the rest of your militia.

1429
01:45:20.264 --> 01:45:21.593
- Take them to the brig.
-Sir!

1430
01:45:21.593 --> 01:45:24.361
Good to see you too. Commander.

1431
01:45:24.464 --> 01:45:26.134
Separate cells.

1432
01:45:26.134 --> 01:45:28.170
Follow me!

1433
01:45:28.272 --> 01:45:29.804
Let's go! Let's get moving!

1434
01:45:31.679 --> 01:45:33.140
- RH.
- KB.

1435
01:45:33.140 --> 01:45:34.204
Come on.

1436
01:45:35.683 --> 01:45:37.046
Go on. move.

1437
01:45:37.148 --> 01:45:37.944
One moment. seaman.

1438
01:45:42.282 --> 01:45:43.312
Billy.

1439
01:45:45.751 --> 01:45:46.623
One eye on the boundary...

1440
01:45:48.522 --> 01:45:49.494
One eye on the pub.

1441
01:45:51.759 --> 01:45:53.322
They'll thank you
for this one day.

1442
01:45:54.196 --> 01:45:55.598
I'm not sure

1443
01:45:55.598 --> 01:45:57.029
that's what we were
really looking for. was it.

1444
01:45:58.366 --> 01:45:59.328
Your Highness?

1445
01:46:01.340 --> 01:46:03.904
Shop's open
for you anytime. Major.

1446
01:46:14.816 --> 01:46:16.452
Sorry to intrude.
Prime Minister.

1447
01:46:16.452 --> 01:46:17.819
but M thought
you should see this.

1448
01:46:23.459 --> 01:46:24.353
Thank you. Gloria.

1449
01:46:34.737 --> 01:46:37.234
-Line up. Face front!

1450
01:46:38.473 --> 01:46:43.276
Line up. Face front!

1451
01:46:43.378 --> 01:46:44.450
No need to shout.

1452
01:46:47.889 --> 01:46:49.648
Stand still!

1453
01:46:49.648 --> 01:46:51.380
Any chance of a cup of tea?

1454
01:46:52.356 --> 01:46:53.716
You. back up to the wall.

1455
01:46:53.818 --> 01:46:54.955
Off the cloth. moth.

1456
01:46:56.194 --> 01:46:57.287
Stand straight!

1457
01:47:08.838 --> 01:47:10.736
Never before
have the senior Military

1458
01:47:10.838 --> 01:47:13.069
and Navy Commanders
of this country

1459
01:47:13.069 --> 01:47:14.777
been so united
in their condemnation.

1460
01:47:15.707 --> 01:47:17.080
It is their view

1461
01:47:17.182 --> 01:47:18.842
that the discipline

1462
01:47:18.842 --> 01:47:21.716
on which
our armed forces depends

1463
01:47:21.716 --> 01:47:24.721
has been undermined
by men serving no master

1464
01:47:24.721 --> 01:47:27.724
but their own thirst
for blood. murder and mayhem.

1465
01:47:30.097 --> 01:47:31.560
Men who disobeyed a direct order

1466
01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:32.894
from the Admiral
of the fleet himself.

1467
01:47:34.935 --> 01:47:35.732
and chose instead

1468
01:47:36.895 --> 01:47:38.427
to trust the whim and intuition

1469
01:47:39.865 --> 01:47:41.430
of the man standing beside him.

1470
01:47:43.207 --> 01:47:44.433
How dare they.

1471
01:47:47.113 --> 01:47:49.613
When only this morning.

1472
01:47:49.715 --> 01:47:52.911
the first American soldiers
arrived on British soil.

1473
01:47:52.911 --> 01:47:54.182
ready to stand
shoulder to shoulder

1474
01:47:54.284 --> 01:47:55.312
with us in Europe.

1475
01:47:57.052 --> 01:47:59.250
Allies who risked death
crossing the North Atlantic.

1476
01:48:00.951 --> 01:48:02.627
and only by some miracle

1477
01:48:04.598 --> 01:48:08.094
found their crossing
untroubled by Nazi U-boats.

1478
01:48:10.568 --> 01:48:12.461
A happy circumstance.
I might add.

1479
01:48:13.833 --> 01:48:16.167
which cannot be accounted for.

1480
01:48:16.269 --> 01:48:18.769
but which has cleared the way
for the United States

1481
01:48:18.769 --> 01:48:20.770
to enter the European war.

1482
01:48:20.770 --> 01:48:22.480
And for which I know

1483
01:48:22.583 --> 01:48:26.277
President Roosevelt
to be immeasurably grateful.

1484
01:48:29.913 --> 01:48:31.047
But setting aside

1485
01:48:31.149 --> 01:48:34.392
this stroke
of unexplained fortune.

1486
01:48:34.494 --> 01:48:37.557
what is to be done
with this unruly company

1487
01:48:37.557 --> 01:48:39.328
who do not obey orders?

1488
01:48:39.328 --> 01:48:40.729
Who seem to have formed

1489
01:48:40.729 --> 01:48:44.631
their own ministry
of ungentlemanly warfare.

1490
01:48:49.539 --> 01:48:51.203
From now on. they work for me.
