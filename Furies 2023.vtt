<i>In this world.</i>
<i>we all have to make a choice</i>

6
00:00:42.416 --> 00:00:44.500
<i>between light and darkness.</i>

7
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.458
<i>But how many of us can choose wisely?</i>

15 YEARS AGO

00:01:41.416 --> 00:01:43.041
<i>From the moment I was born.</i>

10
00:01:43.125 --> 00:01:45.000
<i>I have been destined for darkness.</i>

11
00:01:45.083 --> 00:01:47.458
Mommy. when is dinner ready?

12
00:01:48.125 --> 00:01:50.583
I'm hungry.

13
00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:53.291
Mommy. when is dinner ready?

14
00:01:53.375 --> 00:01:55.958
-Okay. okay. I heard you.
-Mommy?

-I'm not in the mood anymore!
-Honey!

19
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:05.416
Here's your money!

20
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.750
You just leave me for good?

21
00:02:06.833 --> 00:02:08.791
-I'm getting it somewhere else!
-Honey!

22
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.166
Bi. let's eat.

23
00:02:34.083 --> 00:02:37.166

When you go to school tomorrow.

be sure and make a good impression
on your teachers and classmates. okay?

25
00:02:42.708 --> 00:02:44.250
I don't want to go to school.

26
00:02:50.083 --> 00:02:51.541
They said I'm crazy.

27
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:55.958
You're not crazy.

28
00:02:56.791 --> 00:02:57.625
Bi.

29
00:02:57.708 --> 00:02:58.583
Hear me out.

30
00:02:59.458 --> 00:03:00.500
You are…

31
00:03:01.375 --> 00:03:02.791
a very special child.

32
00:03:05.583 --> 00:03:09.583
We are all born equal. What makes us
different are the choices we make.

33
00:03:09.666 --> 00:03:12.750
If you study hard.
we will get out of this situation.

34
00:03:12.833 --> 00:03:13.875
All right?

35
00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:34.666
Lai. where are you? Tell her to come out!

36

Where's your mother? Go get her!
Tell her it's her main man!

38
00:04:07.875 --> 00:04:10.375

51
00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:26.083
Mom…

52
00:05:26.833 --> 00:05:27.958
Mom!

53
00:06:06.083 --> 00:06:10.000
<i>I thought I'd reached the dream.</i>
<i>which is full of light.</i>

54
00:06:10.083 --> 00:06:13.083
<i>But now everything was burnt to ashes.</i>

55
00:06:14.291 --> 00:06:16.000
<i>Without a family</i>

56
00:06:16.083 --> 00:06:18.000
<i>and a place to call home.</i>

57
00:06:18.083 --> 00:06:20.166
<i>I took the last bus</i>

58
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.208
<i>leaving behind this place</i>
<i>and the scent of its burning grass.</i>

59
00:06:35.583 --> 00:06:38.250
<i>Banh mi. anyone?</i>

60
00:06:38.333 --> 00:06:39.166
<i>Here. Thanks.</i>

61
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:44.125
<i>-Mrs. Nam. I need another bowl over here!</i>
<i>-Banh mi. anyone?</i>

62
00:06:44.208 --> 00:06:45.916
<i>Banh mi!</i>

63
00:06:49.916 --> 00:06:52.166
Bitch! Did you forget whose turf this is?

64
00:07:00.625 --> 00:07:01.625
Fuck!

65
00:07:12.125 --> 00:07:15.333
Hey! Stop! Go get her!

66
00:07:17.291 --> 00:07:19.416
<i>Fate still holds me down</i>

67
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.625
<i>and drowns me in despair.</i>

68
00:07:22.208 --> 00:07:23.083
Pull her up!

69
00:07:26.458 --> 00:07:29.000
You fucking bitch!
Did you forget whose turf this is?

70
00:07:33.375 --> 00:07:36.541
A piece of trash like you
is gonna end up being a whore!

71
00:07:36.625 --> 00:07:38.833
Press her down! You're so fucked. bitch!

72
00:07:48.166 --> 00:07:49.875
I'll be back for you!

73
00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.083
<i>Until…</i>

74
00:07:51.625 --> 00:07:52.791
<i>she appeared.</i>

75
00:07:54.666 --> 00:07:56.416
<i>The woman that had been through death.</i>

76
00:07:58.333 --> 00:07:59.583
A girl at your age

77
00:07:59.666 --> 00:08:02.000
sleeping on the streets

78
00:08:02.083 --> 00:08:04.083
is easy prey for those bastards.

79
00:08:09.333 --> 00:08:10.708
Can I come with you?

80
00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:12.416
I'll do whatever you want.

81
00:08:45.166 --> 00:08:46.208
-Hey. Tam.
-Yes.

82
00:08:47.708 --> 00:08:48.958
-One bowl over there.
-Okay.

83
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:51.875
Ms. Lin. hello.

84
00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:52.791
Good.

85
00:08:52.875 --> 00:08:53.875
-Sau.
-Lin.

86
00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.750
-One bowl for me. please.
-Grab a seat.

87
00:08:55.833 --> 00:08:58.166
<i>Last night there was another disturbance</i>

88
00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:00.166
<i>in downtown area.</i>

89
00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:03.250
<i>This is the fourth one this month…</i>

90
00:09:03.333 --> 00:09:05.083
<i>According to local residents.</i>

91
00:09:05.166 --> 00:09:06.750
<i>at about 10:00 p.m..</i>

92
00:09:06.833 --> 00:09:08.208
<i>a group of young men</i>

93
00:09:08.291 --> 00:09:11.333
<i>armed with machetes.</i>
<i>knives. and other weapons</i>

94
00:09:11.416 --> 00:09:14.166
<i>were fighting from…</i>

95
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:17.000
Your old injury acts up in this weather.

96
00:09:17.083 --> 00:09:18.333
But you keep drinking…

97
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:20.083
Right?

98
00:09:20.166 --> 00:09:22.250
And you never go to see a doctor.

99
00:09:22.333 --> 00:09:24.208
The medicine will no longer work one day.

100
00:09:27.375 --> 00:09:29.416
So. another homeless kid.

101
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.708
How many do you intend to collect. Lin?

102
00:09:31.791 --> 00:09:33.583
I'm not any different from them. Sau.

103
00:09:36.166 --> 00:09:38.666
Jeez. you're covered in blood.

104
00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:43.458
Damn!

105
00:09:44.041 --> 00:09:45.791
What filthy hands!

106
00:09:46.625 --> 00:09:47.916
What's your name?

107
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:49.750
Hey. is she mute?

108
00:09:49.833 --> 00:09:51.625
Can she talk?

109
00:09:51.708 --> 00:09:55.250
Hey. what do people call you?

110
00:09:56.166 --> 00:09:57.166
"Whore."

111
00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:58.083
What?

112
00:09:58.166 --> 00:09:59.083
"Whore"?

113
00:09:59.916 --> 00:10:01.125
Nonsense!

114
00:10:01.208 --> 00:10:03.791
What did your mother call you?

115
00:10:06.791 --> 00:10:07.625
Bi.

116
00:10:07.708 --> 00:10:10.750
Okay. so your name is Bi.

117
00:10:11.416 --> 00:10:12.333
Jeez.

118
00:10:12.416 --> 00:10:13.791
Your name means "tragedy."

119
00:10:13.875 --> 00:10:15.666
that's why…

120
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.291
you look like a complete mess.

121
00:10:17.375 --> 00:10:19.583
Get her a new name. will ya?

122
00:10:19.666 --> 00:10:21.875
Something nice.
so she can get a brighter future.

123
00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.500
<i>Chung. gai. banh gio.</i>

124
00:10:34.791 --> 00:10:36.750
Slow night. huh? Can I get a freebie?

125
00:10:36.833 --> 00:10:38.166
Fuck off!

126
00:11:32.541 --> 00:11:36.000
<i>Blown a kiss. for the endless memories</i>

127
00:11:36.083 --> 00:11:37.625
Close the door.

128
00:11:38.583 --> 00:11:39.666
Who's this?

129
00:11:40.208 --> 00:11:41.750
The new girl. Her name is Bi.

130
00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:43.666
She will be staying with us.

131
00:11:44.833 --> 00:11:46.750
Put the noodles on the table for them.

132
00:11:47.916 --> 00:11:48.791
Want a drink?

133
00:11:49.541 --> 00:11:50.458
Aunt Lin?

134
00:11:50.541 --> 00:11:51.916
Look at her!

135
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.291
How can she keep up with us?

136
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.250
Give her a chance.

137
00:11:55.833 --> 00:11:57.791
All right. let's see how long she lasts.

138
00:11:57.875 --> 00:12:01.000
Hong. get her a place to sleep
and some clean clothes.

139
00:12:01.083 --> 00:12:01.958
Okay.

140
00:12:06.125 --> 00:12:07.791
Hey. I'm Hong.

141
00:12:07.875 --> 00:12:08.958
And that is Thanh.

142
00:12:09.875 --> 00:12:11.916
Where'd you come from? You look like shit.

143
00:12:13.833 --> 00:12:16.791
It's fun to have one more
joining the gang. Kind of cute.

144
00:12:17.583 --> 00:12:18.583
But a bit stinky.

145
00:12:18.666 --> 00:12:20.833
Here. have a drink.

146
00:12:24.291 --> 00:12:25.500
Listen.

147
00:12:25.583 --> 00:12:27.375
I don't care where you came from.

148
00:12:27.458 --> 00:12:29.166
but if you wanna stick around.

149
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.708
you have to prove yourself.

150
00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:31.750
You hear me?

151
00:12:31.833 --> 00:12:35.041
My God! You're too ridiculous!

152
00:12:35.125 --> 00:12:36.791
She's just arrived!

153
00:12:36.875 --> 00:12:39.791
That's why no one wants
to make friends with you. Unbelievable.

154
00:12:39.875 --> 00:12:41.333
Let's go and get you cleaned up.

155
00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:52.791
Come here. you!

156
00:12:52.875 --> 00:12:54.375
Let me trim it for you.

157
00:13:06.458 --> 00:13:07.833
Try this!

158
00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:13.250
Come here and take a look!

159
00:13:14.375 --> 00:13:16.041
So cute!

160
00:13:16.833 --> 00:13:17.708
What's wrong?

161
00:13:22.875 --> 00:13:24.291
Jeez. look at you.

162
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.083
So cute!

163
00:13:40.375 --> 00:13:42.375
It's not sexy at all!

164
00:13:42.458 --> 00:13:43.500
Ew!

165
00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:10.083
Stand up.
There is no room for weakness here.

166
00:14:10.166 --> 00:14:13.666
If you don't want men to push you around.
be stronger than them. Again!

167
00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:20.916
Find your opponent's weakness

168
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.208
before you attack.

169
00:14:22.291 --> 00:14:24.166
Everything in your hand must be a weapon.

170
00:14:31.083 --> 00:14:32.166
Does it hurt?

171
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:33.958
Ruthless.

172
00:14:34.041 --> 00:14:34.958
Poor her.

173
00:14:42.833 --> 00:14:44.541
I told you. she's too weak.

174
00:14:44.625 --> 00:14:46.375
Hong and I are enough.

175
00:14:46.458 --> 00:14:48.083
We don't need a weak one like this.

176
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:37.416
Good. Very good.

177
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:48.500
About earlier… thank you.
I have to admit. you're pretty crazy.

178
00:15:48.583 --> 00:15:51.166
I don't think I've ever met
anyone so stubborn.

179
00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:54.750
Drink.
This is your initiation into our group.

180
00:16:00.833 --> 00:16:03.666
-Aunt Lin. come eat with us. please.
-Okay.

181
00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.625
Here. Eat up. Bi.

182
00:16:09.625 --> 00:16:12.916
Everyone here has a past just like yours.
That fat bastard at the bridge

183
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.583
is only one of the many depraved men
out there.

184
00:16:15.666 --> 00:16:18.458
So? You were raped? By how many?

185
00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:24.416
Was yours as wicked as mine? Mine was…

186
00:16:25.083 --> 00:16:26.208
three men at once.

187
00:16:26.291 --> 00:16:27.125
As for Thanh.

188
00:16:27.208 --> 00:16:29.500
she was sold into a brothel.

189
00:16:29.583 --> 00:16:31.375
Probably about ten per night.

190
00:16:31.458 --> 00:16:32.458
Assholes!

191
00:16:32.541 --> 00:16:35.541
That's what men are.
they look at women as toys.

192
00:16:35.625 --> 00:16:38.083
Our suffering just excites them.

193
00:16:38.166 --> 00:16:40.000
We can't count on anyone to protect us.

194
00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:41.416
We need to make a change!

195
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.750
We must make those sickos feel our pain.

196
00:16:45.333 --> 00:16:47.333
Do you want to change that. Bi?

197
00:16:52.625 --> 00:16:53.666
Okay.

198
00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:56.750
Then you have to practice.
Practice until you are strong enough

199
00:16:56.833 --> 00:16:58.416
to end this injustice.

200
00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.500
Understand?

201
00:17:01.041 --> 00:17:02.666
And I know just where to start…

202
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.250
<i>Downtown. there's a crime ring</i>
<i>that sells women</i>

203
00:17:09.333 --> 00:17:11.750
<i>to rich men as sex slaves.</i>

204
00:17:11.833 --> 00:17:13.625
<i>We'll start there.</i>

205
00:17:18.333 --> 00:17:20.208
<i>They are known as "The Big Four."</i>

206
00:17:20.291 --> 00:17:22.041
<i>terrorizing in every corner.</i>

207
00:17:22.125 --> 00:17:24.333
<i>Their leader is Hai. known as "Mad Dog."</i>

208
00:17:24.416 --> 00:17:26.833
<i>They control the nightlife downtown.</i>

209
00:17:26.916 --> 00:17:27.916
<i>sell drugs.</i>

210
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.625
<i>throw these depraved raves</i>
<i>that last all night.</i>

211
00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:34.666
<i>Hai's territory is vast.</i>

212
00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:36.500
<i>but he's not without a lot of enemies.</i>

213
00:17:43.333 --> 00:17:46.458
<i>So far. though. none of them</i>
<i>could get past Hai's three musketeers.</i>

214
00:17:46.541 --> 00:17:47.375
HALF-BLOOD SON

215
00:17:47.458 --> 00:17:49.916
<i>"Half-blood" Son</i>
<i>is Hai's most trusted bodyguard.</i>

216
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
<i>He's a quiet yet ruthless killing machine.</i>

217
00:17:52.083 --> 00:17:55.083
<i>Hai saved his life once.</i>
<i>so he has his utmost loyalty.</i>

218
00:17:55.166 --> 00:17:56.958
<i>If anyone lays a finger on Hai.</i>

219
00:17:57.041 --> 00:17:58.458
<i>Son will skin them alive.</i>

220
00:18:08.208 --> 00:18:09.041
THE DEALER LONG

221
00:18:09.125 --> 00:18:11.291
<i>"The Dealer" Long is Hai's right-hand man.</i>

222
00:18:12.166 --> 00:18:13.625
<i>He is calm and discreet.</i>

223
00:18:13.708 --> 00:18:15.083
<i>A thinking man.</i>

224
00:18:15.166 --> 00:18:18.083
<i>He is in charge of trafficking</i>
<i>and distributing drugs.</i>

225
00:18:18.708 --> 00:18:20.833
<i>They smuggle large amounts of drugs</i>

226
00:18:20.916 --> 00:18:22.416
<i>under the noses of the cops.</i>

227
00:18:23.625 --> 00:18:24.458
Thanks. Boss!

228
00:18:31.291 --> 00:18:32.125
SCARFACE TEO

229
00:18:32.208 --> 00:18:34.833
<i>"Scarface" Teo is the leader</i>
<i>of their sex trafficking ring.</i>

230
00:18:34.916 --> 00:18:38.833
<i>He manages the largest brothels</i>
<i>in Ma Lang. Cau Kho. and bus area.</i>

231
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:46.625
<i>Then there's "Mad Dog" Hai himself.</i>

232
00:18:47.333 --> 00:18:51.791
<i>He was just a street rat. a pickpocket.</i>
<i>After joining Hoang Cathay's gang.</i>

233
00:18:51.875 --> 00:18:54.416
<i>he murdered Hoang's whole family</i>
<i>and became the boss.</i>

234
00:18:55.666 --> 00:18:56.500
MAD DOG HAI

235
00:18:56.583 --> 00:18:59.041
<i>A cruel. sinister.</i>
<i>and cold-blooded lowlife.</i>

236
00:18:59.125 --> 00:19:02.083
For just a snort.
there's nothing you wouldn't do. right?

237
00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.458
<i>What Hai loves most is money.</i>

238
00:19:06.541 --> 00:19:07.375
<i>Then. women.</i>

239
00:19:07.458 --> 00:19:10.125
<i>He personally manages</i>
<i>the biggest casino in downtown area</i>

240
00:19:10.208 --> 00:19:12.083
<i>that's open around the clock.</i>

241
00:19:13.625 --> 00:19:14.458
<i>Those leeches</i>

242
00:19:14.541 --> 00:19:16.541
<i>feed off our suffering like it's nothing.</i>

243
00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:19.916
<i>They are sadistic and inhumane</i>

244
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.875
<i>and deserve to die one by one.</i>

245
00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:24.041
<i>We have to save the women</i>

246
00:19:24.125 --> 00:19:25.958
<i>who are suffering because of them</i>

247
00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:28.000
<i>and make them pay.</i>

248
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:36.833
So?

249
00:19:37.375 --> 00:19:38.625
Why are you looking for me?

250
00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:44.416
They embarrassed me with "Skinhead" Lam.

251
00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.750
<i>Have you found out</i>
<i>who's behind the snakes?</i>

252
00:19:46.833 --> 00:19:48.750
<i>Huong and her fucking goons. no doubt.</i>

253
00:19:48.833 --> 00:19:51.416
<i>Those dirty "Portland" bastards.</i>

254
00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.750
Destroy those motherfuckers.

255
00:19:54.708 --> 00:19:55.875
Let them know…

256
00:19:55.958 --> 00:19:58.291
it's not easy picking in this city.

257
00:19:58.875 --> 00:20:01.208
Hey! Did you hear anything
about some "A Thoong"?

258
00:20:03.416 --> 00:20:04.500
A Thoong.

259
00:20:04.583 --> 00:20:06.541
I heard he's new in Xom Cai.

260
00:20:06.625 --> 00:20:08.333
Did time for smuggling and murder.

261
00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:09.416
Just out of jail.

262
00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.291
he took out "Eight-Fingered" Thanh
and claimed his territory.

263
00:20:13.625 --> 00:20:14.791
Whoa.

264
00:20:16.041 --> 00:20:20.291
Those players are leveling up…
Send him some Chivas as a welcome gift.

265
00:20:20.375 --> 00:20:23.000
See if there's any business
we can do with him.

266
00:20:26.666 --> 00:20:28.125
Have a word with Teo…

267
00:20:28.208 --> 00:20:30.708
Tell him not to shit where he eats.

268
00:20:30.791 --> 00:20:32.916
He raped one of the new girls.

269
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.291
We're businessmen.

270
00:20:34.375 --> 00:20:35.750
not fucking animals.

271
00:20:36.333 --> 00:20:37.333
So what?

272
00:20:38.708 --> 00:20:40.250
He's just testing the merchandise.

273
00:20:40.333 --> 00:20:41.833
After all. he's earned the right.

274
00:20:41.916 --> 00:20:43.166
Thanks to him

275
00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:44.625
that we're swimming in cash!

276
00:20:45.208 --> 00:20:46.916
Let's say he's within his rights.

277
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:48.875
but the girl is just 16.

278
00:20:48.958 --> 00:20:50.375
She's a fucking child!

279
00:20:55.416 --> 00:20:56.833
Forget about children.

280
00:20:57.583 --> 00:20:59.000
He can also fuck my mother

281
00:20:59.083 --> 00:21:00.291
with my blessings.

282
00:21:00.833 --> 00:21:01.958
He brings in big bucks!

283
00:21:02.625 --> 00:21:05.791
Stop overthinking!
Those girls you're talking about?

284
00:21:06.583 --> 00:21:08.416
They're gonna be whores eventually.

285
00:21:09.083 --> 00:21:10.250
I'll say…

286
00:21:11.083 --> 00:21:12.500
we break them in early.

287
00:21:17.416 --> 00:21:19.000
She killed herself.

288
00:21:19.583 --> 00:21:21.041
Did you know that?

289
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.375
If the cops come knocking.
don't ask me for shit.

290
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.416
I start to feel you're just a little bitch
like Hoang.

291
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.541
hiding behind his wife's skirts all
the time and couldn't do a shit.

292
00:21:34.625 --> 00:21:36.958
All right. this is my turf!
I'll handle it!

293
00:21:54.166 --> 00:21:56.000
What's wrong? Can't sleep?

294
00:22:02.541 --> 00:22:06.000
I couldn't sleep when I first came here
either. Every time I closed my eyes.

295
00:22:06.083 --> 00:22:07.875
I saw my haunted past.

296
00:22:07.958 --> 00:22:09.791
Honey…

297
00:22:15.833 --> 00:22:17.750
She's dreaming
of fucking Dan Truong again.

298
00:22:19.083 --> 00:22:20.458
I don't dream.

299
00:22:22.625 --> 00:22:23.875
I'm just haunted by…

300
00:22:24.958 --> 00:22:26.166
the darkness.

301
00:22:29.583 --> 00:22:31.916
People like us can never sleep well.

302
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:39.000
Try listening to this.

303
00:22:39.083 --> 00:22:40.041
Might help you sleep.

304
00:22:40.916 --> 00:22:42.083
You'll get used to it.

305
00:23:09.875 --> 00:23:11.000
Where's my bra. Thanh?

306
00:23:11.083 --> 00:23:12.416
Why don't you ask Jacqueline?

307
00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.791
-You always ask me.
-No way. I wouldn't dare.

308
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.541
That's a wild daisy.
They bloom around here a lot.

309
00:23:20.625 --> 00:23:22.666
<i>They are said to be</i>
<i>the symbol of resilience.</i>

310
00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:24.750
<i>surviving in the harshest conditions.</i>

311
00:23:43.291 --> 00:23:44.833
God. you scared me.

312
00:23:46.666 --> 00:23:49.500
I just got back from Hoang Phap Pagoda.
And got you this charm.

313
00:23:49.583 --> 00:23:52.250
It will bring you peace.

314
00:23:52.333 --> 00:23:53.458
Put it on.

315
00:23:54.166 --> 00:23:56.375
And you will sleep very well

316
00:23:56.458 --> 00:23:58.500
and dream
about going to school. all right?

317
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.166
Thank you. Sau.

318
00:24:01.666 --> 00:24:03.083
I'll never take it off.

319
00:24:38.875 --> 00:24:40.875
You don't have to train today.

320
00:24:40.958 --> 00:24:42.625
I have a mission for you.

321
00:24:42.708 --> 00:24:45.500
Bi. this is your first chance
to prove yourself.

322
00:24:48.791 --> 00:24:50.875
<i>Your first target is Michael.</i>

323
00:24:51.458 --> 00:24:55.041
<i>This guy is Hai's</i>
<i>new drug manufacturer and provider.</i>

324
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.250
Hey! What are you doing?

325
00:25:04.583 --> 00:25:06.333
Bi. you're up!

326
00:25:10.916 --> 00:25:13.041
I asked you to fix Michael up
with some girls.

327
00:25:14.708 --> 00:25:16.083
And now he's left town.

328
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.833
no longer wants to do business with us.

329
00:25:18.916 --> 00:25:21.000
I've been courting his deal for a year

330
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.166
and you threw it all away.

331
00:25:24.291 --> 00:25:28.333
-What am I going to do with you?
-Boss… please…

332
00:25:28.416 --> 00:25:29.750
It's not my fault.

333
00:25:30.416 --> 00:25:33.625
-Those bitches. It's theirs!
-Just a few little girls.

334
00:25:33.708 --> 00:25:36.500
but you still couldn't handle it.
It really is your fault.

335
00:25:38.916 --> 00:25:40.833
-Come in.
-Your medicine.

336
00:25:41.916 --> 00:25:45.791
It's probably Huong's gang.
She's always been hungry for your turf.

337
00:25:46.916 --> 00:25:48.375
All right.

338
00:25:48.458 --> 00:25:49.583
If she's hungry.

339
00:25:50.666 --> 00:25:51.625
I'll feed her.

340
00:25:51.708 --> 00:25:54.875
-Congrats. boss!
-Boss. congrats on getting this turf!

341
00:26:07.208 --> 00:26:10.000
Huong is out of the picture.
We have to change our plan.

342
00:26:10.083 --> 00:26:13.250
And we must act now
because our cover is blown.

343
00:26:13.333 --> 00:26:15.583
From now on.
it's gonna be much more dangerous.

344
00:26:15.666 --> 00:26:18.000
Don't worry. We're all ready.

345
00:26:19.625 --> 00:26:20.833
This is a large shipment.

346
00:26:20.916 --> 00:26:22.958
We need to move fast before the pigs come.

347
00:26:23.041 --> 00:26:25.208
-Are you confident?
-You don't need to worry.

348
00:26:25.291 --> 00:26:27.583
If these goods
are as high-grade as you say.

349
00:26:27.666 --> 00:26:31.583
it's not gonna be a problem.
My clients can pay to play.

350
00:26:31.666 --> 00:26:33.500
Money… is not a big deal.

351
00:26:34.208 --> 00:26:35.333
Wow.

352
00:26:36.333 --> 00:26:40.541
You move it fast.
we're going to make a big score!

353
00:26:44.416 --> 00:26:45.500
Hai.

354
00:26:45.583 --> 00:26:50.125
Remember. you have to be prestigious
if you want to do business with me.

355
00:26:50.208 --> 00:26:53.166
If something goes south
with this shipment.

356
00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:55.666
you'll give me Nancy Market's territory!

357
00:26:59.083 --> 00:27:01.541
-Sir. please buy something…
<i>-Hello.</i>

358
00:27:01.625 --> 00:27:05.083
I'll come to talk to "Skinhead" Lam.
You can handle the ice factory.

359
00:27:05.166 --> 00:27:07.333
<i>What? How can I take care of them…</i>

360
00:27:07.416 --> 00:27:10.416
What the fuck are you afraid of those
Xom Cai goons?

361
00:27:12.166 --> 00:27:13.125
It's 2.000 dong. sir.

362
00:27:13.208 --> 00:27:16.750
<i>Hai's having a deal</i>
<i>with the Xom Cai boss. A Thoong.</i>

363
00:27:16.833 --> 00:27:19.541
<i>If it goes through.</i>
<i>it'll pave the way for them</i>

364
00:27:19.625 --> 00:27:21.666
<i>to lay their hands on even more girls.</i>

365
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:23.583
<i>We have to stop them at all costs.</i>

366
00:27:23.666 --> 00:27:26.041
-Hurry up!
-Climb up!

367
00:27:26.125 --> 00:27:27.083
Step up!

368
00:27:27.166 --> 00:27:28.166
<i>Tomorrow at 11:00 p.m..</i>

369
00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:30.916
<i>they're gonna take the girls</i>
<i>to Phong Van Port in Cau Kho.</i>

370
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.666
<i>They will choose and rate the girls there</i>

371
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:36.000
<i>and move them to the brothels.</i>

372
00:27:36.708 --> 00:27:39.791
Nguyen Thi Le Mai. 16 years old.
raped. then murdered.

373
00:27:40.625 --> 00:27:42.041
The person who did this is Teo.

374
00:27:42.125 --> 00:27:45.000
He's also the one in charge
of "Mad Dog" Hai's brothel business.

375
00:27:45.083 --> 00:27:46.208
I know him.

376
00:27:46.291 --> 00:27:48.875
-How come?
-I was sold into one of his brothels.

377
00:27:48.958 --> 00:27:51.666
You have no idea
how he has harmed many girls.

378
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:52.666
Right.

379
00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:54.375
It's time…

380
00:27:55.041 --> 00:27:56.416
we made them pay.

381
00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:07.666
Hurry up! Get in here!

382
00:28:08.625 --> 00:28:10.666
Get in here!

383
00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:11.625
Quickly!

384
00:28:11.708 --> 00:28:13.083
Shut your mouths!

385
00:28:13.166 --> 00:28:14.500
Let me go!

386
00:28:14.583 --> 00:28:16.541
Ut! Ut!

387
00:28:16.625 --> 00:28:18.750
-Help me!
-Ut!

388
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.291
Sir! Please. sir. spare me!

389
00:28:30.458 --> 00:28:31.500
Double three!

390
00:28:31.583 --> 00:28:32.625
Double four!

391
00:28:32.708 --> 00:28:33.750
Win.

392
00:28:50.416 --> 00:28:52.666
Sir. please! I'm begging you!

393
00:28:54.083 --> 00:28:55.250
Sir…

394
00:28:55.333 --> 00:28:56.875
Please spare me. sir!

395
00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.333
Thank you.

396
00:29:27.166 --> 00:29:28.500
Please help my sister!

397
00:29:29.083 --> 00:29:30.250
Shut up!

398
00:29:31.625 --> 00:29:32.458
Fuck you.

399
00:29:33.291 --> 00:29:35.291
Shut up. or I'll break your necks!

400
00:29:37.208 --> 00:29:39.583
Jeez. such a terrible person!

401
00:29:39.666 --> 00:29:42.750
You go to the other room.
I want to save these girls.

402
00:30:03.416 --> 00:30:08.083
This is Grade-A stuff.
Why the fuck do you have to test it?

403
00:30:09.041 --> 00:30:09.916
All right?

404
00:30:10.666 --> 00:30:13.333
Are you trying to say
A Thoong doesn't trust our boss. Hai?

405
00:30:13.416 --> 00:30:16.000
You know. here in this turf.

406
00:30:16.083 --> 00:30:19.416
if Hai doesn't have the good stuff.
none of those fuckers out there does.

407
00:30:21.125 --> 00:30:21.958
Hey!

408
00:32:40.208 --> 00:32:43.000
There's an important briefcase there.
Bring it back to me.

409
00:32:43.666 --> 00:32:45.625
The place is on fire!
Let's get out of here!

410
00:33:37.291 --> 00:33:39.291
Thanh. speed up!

411
00:33:56.333 --> 00:33:58.333
Bi. what's wrong? Hurry up.

412
00:33:58.416 --> 00:33:59.833
You look tired.

413
00:34:02.041 --> 00:34:04.666
Thanh. you eventually
took revenge on them.

414
00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:06.416
I'm so happy for you.

415
00:34:07.625 --> 00:34:09.500
Aunt Lin. mission accomplished.

416
00:34:09.583 --> 00:34:12.250
The ice factory is finished.
and Teo is dead.

417
00:34:13.666 --> 00:34:16.708
-Very good.
-Excuse me. I have to go to my room.

418
00:34:16.791 --> 00:34:18.750
What's wrong with her?

419
00:34:18.833 --> 00:34:20.375
Is she okay?

420
00:34:52.041 --> 00:34:53.416
Bi.

421
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:56.833
Bi.

422
00:34:58.875 --> 00:35:00.041
Bi!

423
00:35:01.416 --> 00:35:03.583
Bi. It's me! It's me. Thanh! Bi!

424
00:35:11.083 --> 00:35:12.083
Bi!

425
00:35:17.916 --> 00:35:19.041
Bi!

426
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:21.708
Bi… calm down!

427
00:35:21.791 --> 00:35:22.708
Bi!

428
00:35:23.541 --> 00:35:24.416
Bi!

429
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:31.875
Bi!

430
00:36:05.833 --> 00:36:07.416
Except for Huong's gang.

431
00:36:08.666 --> 00:36:10.583
who would dare to do it?

432
00:36:11.916 --> 00:36:13.041
How many of them?

433
00:36:13.125 --> 00:36:14.000
Tell me.

434
00:36:15.083 --> 00:36:17.291
-Tell me!
-There were… three girls.

435
00:36:17.916 --> 00:36:19.083
What?

436
00:36:21.083 --> 00:36:23.416
Sir. there were… three girls.

437
00:36:30.833 --> 00:36:33.125
Three girls?
And somehow they broke in here.

438
00:36:33.208 --> 00:36:36.125
killed Teo. and burnt my place down?
Motherfucker!

439
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:44.625
What the fuck were you guys doing?
I told you this is a big deal.

440
00:36:45.416 --> 00:36:46.750
What are we gonna do?

441
00:36:46.833 --> 00:36:47.833
Huh?

442
00:36:49.208 --> 00:36:50.583
What's wrong with you?

443
00:36:51.208 --> 00:36:55.125
I was taking care of "Skinhead" Lam
yesterday. don't you remember?

444
00:37:01.333 --> 00:37:03.416
Please spare us…

445
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:13.750
<i>What kind of business are you running?</i>

446
00:37:13.833 --> 00:37:17.333
<i>The goods didn't arrived.</i>
<i>and my two men vanished into thin air.</i>

447
00:37:17.416 --> 00:37:19.416
-<i>The way you're doing business…</i>
-A Thoong…

448
00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:23.000
Let's just say I had bad luck this time.
Nancy Market is now yours.

449
00:37:23.083 --> 00:37:24.333
<i>Not that easy.</i>

450
00:37:24.416 --> 00:37:27.208
<i>It goes without saying</i>
<i>Nancy Market is now mine.</i>

451
00:37:27.291 --> 00:37:29.250
<i>But also you still have</i>
<i>to deliver my goods.</i>

452
00:37:29.333 --> 00:37:31.500
<i>I'll give you three days.</i>

453
00:37:31.583 --> 00:37:34.166
<i>Otherwise.</i>
<i>I'll storm the rest of your turf.</i>

454
00:37:37.166 --> 00:37:39.416
Find those motherfuckers for me!

455
00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:42.208
Cheers! Happy birthday. Hong!

456
00:37:43.666 --> 00:37:46.875
This is the first time someone's
thrown a birthday party for me. Sau.

457
00:37:46.958 --> 00:37:47.791
Isn't it?

458
00:37:47.875 --> 00:37:49.375
Thank you. Sau.

459
00:37:50.916 --> 00:37:52.291
It's spicy. don't stir it up.

460
00:37:52.375 --> 00:37:55.666
-Did you make this porridge. Sau?
-Hey. cheer up. it's my birthday.

461
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:57.250
-Very delicious!
-The truth is…

462
00:37:57.333 --> 00:38:00.666
I never thought there'd be so many people
celebrating my birthday.

463
00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:03.250
Cheer up.

464
00:38:03.333 --> 00:38:05.083
Blow out the candle and make a wish!

465
00:38:05.166 --> 00:38:06.458
HAPPY 19TH BIRTHDAY
THU HONG

466
00:38:07.916 --> 00:38:08.833
Happy birthday.

467
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:11.041
Say something.

468
00:38:13.958 --> 00:38:17.875
Thanks to you guys.
I learned to be strong.

469
00:38:18.833 --> 00:38:21.833
to protect myself
and women who are weaker than me.

470
00:38:22.958 --> 00:38:24.125
I have…

471
00:38:25.416 --> 00:38:28.250
found happiness when I'm with you.

472
00:38:28.333 --> 00:38:29.416
I wish that…

473
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:31.833
from now on.

474
00:38:31.916 --> 00:38:36.166
we will always be a family.

475
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.916
that we'll always love
and protect each other.

476
00:38:41.208 --> 00:38:43.208
Why are you so cheesy all of a sudden?

477
00:38:44.833 --> 00:38:46.166
-No. she's not.
-Sit down.

478
00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:48.000
I'd wish the same.

479
00:38:48.583 --> 00:38:51.500
If everyone were happy like you.

480
00:38:51.583 --> 00:38:53.458
that'd be a good enough life.

481
00:38:53.541 --> 00:38:55.333
Cheers!

482
00:38:55.416 --> 00:38:56.916
Cheers!

483
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.708
-Cheers. Happy birthday!
-You are the happiest.

484
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:06.708
Aunty. thanks to Bi.
we completed the mission yesterday.

485
00:39:06.791 --> 00:39:10.291
She was quick and vicious like a wolf.
I was surprised.

486
00:39:10.916 --> 00:39:13.583
Well. it was because
Thanh knew how to protect her pack.

487
00:39:13.666 --> 00:39:16.083
-I was just following her lead.
-Good.

488
00:39:16.166 --> 00:39:18.500
You girls must stick together.

489
00:39:18.583 --> 00:39:21.416
Then no one will be able to break you up.
You understand?

490
00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:24.375
Hey. you two wolves. what about me?

491
00:39:25.375 --> 00:39:28.291
-I'm a fierce. sexy wolf too…
-Can I have some more. please?

492
00:39:28.375 --> 00:39:29.666
I was there. too.

493
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:33.083
-Here.
-Come on. you guys…

494
00:39:33.166 --> 00:39:34.666
<i>Aunt Lin and everyone</i>

495
00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:37.125
<i>has shown me the warmth of a family.</i>

496
00:39:37.208 --> 00:39:38.458
Here's your chicken.

497
00:39:38.541 --> 00:39:41.458
-Thanh. how about my birthday gift?
-Your chicken.

498
00:39:43.166 --> 00:39:45.250
Hong is too clumsy. Sau.

499
00:39:45.333 --> 00:39:47.375
<i>But there is a part of me</i>

500
00:39:48.208 --> 00:39:50.416
<i>that's not fully ready to embrace it.</i>

501
00:40:05.333 --> 00:40:06.666
It's been five years.

502
00:40:07.375 --> 00:40:09.500
Time does fly.

503
00:40:09.583 --> 00:40:12.250
Every time it rains. I miss Hoang.

504
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000
Tomorrow is his death anniversary.

505
00:40:15.583 --> 00:40:18.125
I still remember every time it rained.

506
00:40:18.208 --> 00:40:20.750
he'd ask me to make him

507
00:40:20.833 --> 00:40:23.750
a bowl of noodles
with a lot of pork cracklings.

508
00:40:23.833 --> 00:40:25.333
He'd wolf it down

509
00:40:25.416 --> 00:40:26.666
and then yelled out.

510
00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:29.958
"Your noodles are the best.
your noodles are the best."

511
00:40:30.583 --> 00:40:34.500
Thanks to it. I raised him and Long
until they're grown-ups.

512
00:40:35.583 --> 00:40:36.833
But now.

513
00:40:36.916 --> 00:40:39.250
even if I make the best noodle soup.

514
00:40:39.333 --> 00:40:41.250
Hoang couldn't eat it anymore.

515
00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:46.750
They got rid of Huong.

516
00:40:46.833 --> 00:40:49.583
Hai is turning the town upside down.
searching for the girls.

517
00:40:49.666 --> 00:40:52.791
He had to give up Nancy Market
to A Thoong to save face.

518
00:40:52.875 --> 00:40:54.291
And the death of Teo.

519
00:40:55.583 --> 00:40:56.916
he's furious.

520
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.916
I think from now on. you should
consider your next move carefully.

521
00:41:03.083 --> 00:41:04.541
Or you can just drop it.

522
00:41:05.166 --> 00:41:07.041
It's been such a long time.

523
00:41:07.125 --> 00:41:09.166
What happened was fate.

524
00:41:09.916 --> 00:41:12.333
Your life is also not bad now.

525
00:41:12.416 --> 00:41:14.083
Let's just start over.

526
00:41:14.166 --> 00:41:17.666
You… keep putting yourself
back in that world…

527
00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:20.416
it makes me worried.

528
00:41:21.333 --> 00:41:22.958
If anything happens to you…

529
00:41:23.916 --> 00:41:26.083
how am I gonna live on?

530
00:41:26.166 --> 00:41:28.916
It's raining so I made some tea for you.

531
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000
Is it strong?
I don't want to stay up tonight.

532
00:41:32.083 --> 00:41:33.833
It's lighter than yesterday.

533
00:42:23.833 --> 00:42:24.750
Honey?

534
00:42:25.916 --> 00:42:28.916
I want the two of us
to have a new future together.

535
00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:32.083
Ever since I met you…

536
00:42:35.583 --> 00:42:37.541
I've grown to despise this way of life.

537
00:42:38.916 --> 00:42:40.291
Just give me some time.

538
00:42:43.791 --> 00:42:45.958
After having paid off my debt
for this life.

539
00:42:47.666 --> 00:42:49.416
I will give you a new life.

540
00:43:04.083 --> 00:43:05.625
<i>Have you ever wondered</i>

541
00:43:06.291 --> 00:43:08.625
if what we are doing is right or wrong?

542
00:43:09.333 --> 00:43:10.541
Why do you ask?

543
00:43:14.416 --> 00:43:17.375
-Since I killed Teo…
-You were scared. weren't you?

544
00:43:18.041 --> 00:43:20.041
Everyone feels the same
for their first time.

545
00:43:20.125 --> 00:43:21.041
No.

546
00:43:21.916 --> 00:43:23.250
I liked it.

547
00:43:23.833 --> 00:43:27.041
And I was afraid of myself… liking it.

548
00:43:27.625 --> 00:43:28.708
That feeling…

549
00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:32.333
made me feel free.

550
00:43:34.416 --> 00:43:36.541
I can drown in my own darkness.

551
00:43:36.625 --> 00:43:39.125
But there's still something inside of me

552
00:43:39.208 --> 00:43:40.583
screaming out…

553
00:43:41.541 --> 00:43:42.750
that it's not right.

554
00:43:46.625 --> 00:43:47.958
You know what?

555
00:43:48.041 --> 00:43:51.416
If killing people makes the world
a better place. then I'll do it.

556
00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:54.416
Is it our world that's better.
or just Aunt Lin's?

557
00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:58.416
What do you mean?

558
00:44:01.166 --> 00:44:02.708
What's in that briefcase you took?

559
00:44:11.208 --> 00:44:12.625
See the kids down there?

560
00:44:15.125 --> 00:44:16.916
That used to be my world.

561
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.250
QUARTER 5

562
00:44:18.333 --> 00:44:20.125
It was dark and shameful.

563
00:44:20.208 --> 00:44:22.833
I couldn't take it anymore.
so I risked my life to escape.

564
00:44:24.083 --> 00:44:25.541
I just wanted to die back then.

565
00:44:26.375 --> 00:44:29.750
Then Aunt Lin brought me here.
gave me a new life.

566
00:44:29.833 --> 00:44:32.166
and taught me how to live with purpose.

567
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:35.958
It's like I was reborn. thanks to her.
So I choose to trust her.

568
00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:39.125
And I believe what we're doing is right.

569
00:44:42.333 --> 00:44:44.000
You know why I'm still here?

570
00:44:45.833 --> 00:44:47.625
Because you make me feel like…

571
00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:50.041
a family.

572
00:44:52.916 --> 00:44:55.416
You remind me of my younger sister. Thao.

573
00:44:56.333 --> 00:44:57.291
Where's she now?

574
00:45:02.041 --> 00:45:04.875
By the way. if we're a family now.

575
00:45:05.583 --> 00:45:07.250
then no matter what happens.

576
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.333
we'll always stay together. Promise me.

577
00:45:11.333 --> 00:45:12.666
Except my mom.

578
00:45:13.833 --> 00:45:15.333
there's only you with me.

579
00:45:15.916 --> 00:45:16.833
Hey!

580
00:45:16.916 --> 00:45:17.916
What about me?

581
00:45:21.083 --> 00:45:22.250
And Hong.

582
00:45:22.333 --> 00:45:24.958
I thought you had forgotten me.

583
00:45:25.041 --> 00:45:25.875
Give me that.

584
00:45:29.625 --> 00:45:30.875
No matter what.

585
00:45:30.958 --> 00:45:32.666
we'll always be sisters.

586
00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:35.791
Together forever. To our new future!

587
00:45:35.875 --> 00:45:37.000
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

588
00:45:43.083 --> 00:45:45.375
<i>Goodbye</i>

589
00:45:45.458 --> 00:45:50.750
<i>Don't look back to that sinful life</i>

590
00:45:50.833 --> 00:45:51.666
<i>Goodbye</i>

591
00:47:00.208 --> 00:47:02.083
<i>We all have our own story.</i>

592
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.333
<i>We all have our loss.</i>

593
00:47:04.916 --> 00:47:09.708
<i>That night. we were the women of our fate.</i>
<i>leaning on one another</i>

594
00:47:10.541 --> 00:47:11.833
<i>like blood sisters.</i>

595
00:47:12.666 --> 00:47:14.916
<i>trying to forget the painful memories</i>

596
00:47:15.666 --> 00:47:17.250
<i>and the haunting traumas.</i>

597
00:47:47.041 --> 00:47:52.750
THREE PEOPLE FOUND DEAD TRAGICALLY
IN THEIR HOME

598
00:48:11.291 --> 00:48:13.000
<i>We were like wildflowers.</i>

599
00:48:13.916 --> 00:48:16.208
<i>trying to rise up in the dark.</i>

600
00:48:53.083 --> 00:48:54.875
So. Jacqueline is still alive?

601
00:48:56.583 --> 00:48:57.541
Right?

602
00:48:58.250 --> 00:48:59.250
Where is she?

603
00:49:00.250 --> 00:49:02.625
-I don't know.
-Where is she?

604
00:49:02.708 --> 00:49:04.583
-Where is she hiding?
-I don't know.

605
00:49:04.666 --> 00:49:06.291
Fucker!

606
00:49:12.208 --> 00:49:14.125
Motherfucker!

607
00:49:15.708 --> 00:49:18.166
<i>A rat. wise as it is.</i>

608
00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:20.458
<i>can't resist the perfect bait.</i>

609
00:49:22.333 --> 00:49:24.375
<i>Our final target is "Mad Dog" Hai.</i>

610
00:49:25.208 --> 00:49:28.083
<i>Finish him.</i>
<i>and we'll save hundreds of girls.</i>

611
00:49:28.166 --> 00:49:30.875
<i>Every night.</i>
<i>Hai ends up at the New Century Club.</i>

612
00:49:30.958 --> 00:49:34.625
<i>It's a brothel in disguise</i>
<i>to pimp out the girls they kidnap.</i>

613
00:49:34.708 --> 00:49:38.041
Easy-peasy. We'll just take care of it
like we did the ice factory. right?

614
00:49:38.125 --> 00:49:39.416
It's not gonna be that easy.

615
00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:43.166
Hai's not afraid to show his face there.
that means the place is absolutely safe.

616
00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:45.250
<i>That's right. The club is heavily guarded.</i>

617
00:49:45.333 --> 00:49:48.166
<i>His favorite spot is the VIP section</i>
<i>on the second floor.</i>

618
00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:51.875
<i>This area is off-limits</i>
<i>except for his underlings and servers.</i>

619
00:49:51.958 --> 00:49:54.250
Hai has one weakness… Women.

620
00:49:54.833 --> 00:49:57.583
And you three
are the perfect baits for him.

621
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:06.958
New merch?

622
00:50:07.041 --> 00:50:09.958
Madame Lan brought her in.
She's the hottest at Pink Night Club.

623
00:50:11.333 --> 00:50:14.458
I don't fucking care where she comes from.
but she has to be mine.

624
00:50:15.875 --> 00:50:17.375
Honey. what about me?

625
00:50:19.375 --> 00:50:21.708
-What the fuck?
-I'm sorry.

626
00:50:22.583 --> 00:50:23.833
I'm sorry.

627
00:50:36.875 --> 00:50:38.125
Apology not accepted.

628
00:50:39.166 --> 00:50:40.500
Finish this.

629
00:50:46.458 --> 00:50:47.791
Wow!

630
00:50:50.041 --> 00:50:52.791
Isn't today… Hoang's death anniversary?

631
00:50:53.416 --> 00:50:54.583
Son told me that

632
00:50:54.666 --> 00:50:56.333
Jacqueline is still alive.

633
00:50:57.208 --> 00:50:59.291
She's back to avenge her husband's death.

634
00:51:00.666 --> 00:51:02.750
Now. tell me…
why would she still be alive?

635
00:51:02.833 --> 00:51:06.750
I saw her in the morgue with my own eyes.
You don't believe me now?

636
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.708
I never said I don't believe you.

637
00:51:12.791 --> 00:51:14.291
I killed her once.

638
00:51:14.833 --> 00:51:16.750
Even if she got ten more lives

639
00:51:16.833 --> 00:51:18.208
I still can kill her.

640
00:51:19.166 --> 00:51:20.666
What can a woman like her

641
00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:24.083
do to me?

642
00:51:30.416 --> 00:51:32.791
I'll go celebrate his death anniversary.

643
00:52:20.958 --> 00:52:24.416
You like it rough. huh?

644
00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:26.750
You want this? Huh? Like this?

645
00:52:31.125 --> 00:52:32.875
Scream! Give it your best. bitch.

646
00:52:32.958 --> 00:52:34.625
Fuck you!

647
00:52:53.416 --> 00:52:54.791
You're so fucking dead.

648
00:53:08.583 --> 00:53:09.416
Bi.

649
00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:10.666
Men!

650
00:53:15.541 --> 00:53:17.583
Kill those two bitches!

651
00:53:19.541 --> 00:53:21.750
Long. get the car!

652
00:53:22.833 --> 00:53:23.833
Now!

653
00:55:09.833 --> 00:55:11.750
Hey. got any money?

654
00:55:11.833 --> 00:55:13.000
Lend me some. will you?

655
00:55:35.208 --> 00:55:36.750
Hong!

656
00:56:40.416 --> 00:56:43.416
Choose a new life for yourself.

657
00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:56.541
I love you.

658
01:01:13.083 --> 01:01:14.916
Why are you driving like that!

659
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Why are you driving like crazy?
Do you even have eyes?

660
01:01:21.166 --> 01:01:22.166
Hey!

661
01:01:46.916 --> 01:01:48.833
Goal!

662
01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:02.750
Hello! You want some noodles?

663
01:03:02.833 --> 01:03:04.791
Sir. we are open at 6:00 a.m.

664
01:03:04.875 --> 01:03:07.541
Please come back later. I'm sorry.

665
01:03:41.708 --> 01:03:42.541
Aunt Lin!

666
01:03:42.625 --> 01:03:44.791
-Come out here. Aunt Lin!
-Bi!

667
01:03:44.875 --> 01:03:45.833
Bi.

668
01:03:47.041 --> 01:03:48.250
Bi. calm down.

669
01:03:50.541 --> 01:03:53.666
What's all this?
What's the story between you and Hai?

670
01:03:54.666 --> 01:03:58.416
-Where is Hong? Why it's just you two?
-This assassination…

671
01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:03.750
wasn't to fight for any bullshit justice.
It was to take revenge for you. wasn't it?

672
01:04:03.833 --> 01:04:04.708
Aunt Lin.

673
01:04:05.791 --> 01:04:07.375
what is Bi talking about?

674
01:04:08.833 --> 01:04:11.250
Where is Hong? Huh? Answer me!

675
01:04:12.583 --> 01:04:16.708
She's dead. She died for the false ideals
that you brainwashed us with!

676
01:04:16.791 --> 01:04:17.791
Say something!

677
01:04:21.250 --> 01:04:22.541
Why did she die?

678
01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:28.291
I've been planning this for a year.

679
01:04:28.375 --> 01:04:30.083
Every detail.

680
01:04:30.791 --> 01:04:32.041
What went wrong?

681
01:04:34.250 --> 01:04:36.791
-Why don't you answer me?
-What did you say?

682
01:04:36.875 --> 01:04:39.666
You want us to kill Hai to avenge
your husband. am I right?

683
01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:40.750
Shut up!

684
01:04:41.708 --> 01:04:44.625
You know nothing
about my husband. all right?

685
01:04:44.708 --> 01:04:46.958
You didn't see my husband…

686
01:04:47.041 --> 01:04:50.875
dying there with his eyes open.
my son thrashing in a pool of his blood.

687
01:04:50.958 --> 01:04:52.333
And me…

688
01:04:54.541 --> 01:04:56.500
living a life worse than death.

689
01:04:58.041 --> 01:04:59.958
I've lost everything.

690
01:05:00.041 --> 01:05:02.000
Do you have any idea? Huh?

691
01:05:07.833 --> 01:05:08.666
Bi.

692
01:05:09.416 --> 01:05:10.583
Calm down. Bi.

693
01:05:11.166 --> 01:05:16.166
And you. you and your family.
why didn't you tell us in the first place?

694
01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:19.583
For that. I was wrong
for not having told you.

695
01:05:20.916 --> 01:05:25.125
But Hai is a bastard.
If we don't kill him. thousands of girls…

696
01:05:25.208 --> 01:05:26.541
Enough!

697
01:05:26.625 --> 01:05:28.875
Stop treating us like children!

698
01:05:30.458 --> 01:05:32.000
-Bi!
-Thanh!

699
01:05:33.083 --> 01:05:36.458
Bi is thoughtless.
it's all right if she doesn't trust me.

700
01:05:37.875 --> 01:05:40.416
But you have been with me all these years.

701
01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:42.833
-You have to trust me.
-Enough.

702
01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:47.541
I have heard these words too many times.

703
01:05:48.541 --> 01:05:50.750
Hong is dead.

704
01:05:51.833 --> 01:05:53.000
She is dead.

705
01:05:55.833 --> 01:05:57.625
What more do you want from us?

706
01:06:09.416 --> 01:06:14.500
Flowers can't live without sunlight.
just like humans can't live without love.

707
01:06:14.583 --> 01:06:18.583
Only love can keep your hope alive.

708
01:06:32.833 --> 01:06:37.458
<i>Bi! I'll be the light of your life.</i>
<i>and you'll bloom. Okay?</i>

709
01:06:37.541 --> 01:06:39.958
<i>My life is dark enough as it is.</i>

710
01:06:40.041 --> 01:06:42.500
<i>so I want to add as much color as I can.</i>

711
01:06:42.583 --> 01:06:45.333
<i>Bi! Quick. I got her!</i>

712
01:06:45.416 --> 01:06:47.208
<i>Bi!</i>

713
01:06:47.291 --> 01:06:48.125
<i>I said no!</i>

714
01:06:48.208 --> 01:06:50.583
<i>Please. just a thin line!</i>

715
01:06:50.666 --> 01:06:53.625
<i>Let me do it! Hold still!</i>

716
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.166
I've never…

717
01:07:29.166 --> 01:07:32.166
I've never been fooled
by just two girls like that!

718
01:07:33.250 --> 01:07:34.500
Who are they?

719
01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:40.333
They are Jacqueline's
and the ones that killed Teo.

720
01:07:40.416 --> 01:07:43.166
I have found their hideout.
Waiting for your orders.

721
01:07:44.083 --> 01:07:45.916
Jacqueline.

722
01:07:46.833 --> 01:07:49.625
Came into my house and fooled me. huh?

723
01:07:49.708 --> 01:07:52.875
<i>The location of the center of the storm</i>
<i>is above the western coast of</i>

724
01:07:52.958 --> 01:07:54.125
<i>Vietnam and Philippines.</i>

725
01:07:54.208 --> 01:07:56.375
<i>The strongest wind</i>
<i>in the area near the center.</i>

726
01:07:56.458 --> 01:07:59.583
<i>is as strong as level 5 and 6.</i>
<i>with gusts of level 7.</i>

727
01:08:15.166 --> 01:08:16.416
Are you taking off?

728
01:08:17.333 --> 01:08:19.083
There is nowhere for us.

729
01:08:19.750 --> 01:08:21.333
This is our home.

730
01:08:23.333 --> 01:08:26.541
Home? You still think of this as home?

731
01:08:28.708 --> 01:08:33.041
I know you're angry at Aunt Lin.
and blame yourself for Hong's death.

732
01:08:34.833 --> 01:08:39.000
But her death is not your fault
nor Aunt Lin's.

733
01:08:39.083 --> 01:08:41.083
It's the fault of those bastards.

734
01:08:41.833 --> 01:08:43.000
Think of it.

735
01:08:43.083 --> 01:08:47.916
If it weren't for their cruelty.
Lin wouldn't need to take revenge.

736
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.666
you and I wouldn't be here.

737
01:08:50.833 --> 01:08:52.541
and Hong wouldn't have died.

738
01:08:54.666 --> 01:08:56.583
Hong was just the first.

739
01:08:56.666 --> 01:08:58.666
You and me are next.

740
01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:00.541
You still choose to trust her?

741
01:09:04.666 --> 01:09:07.125
My sister. Thao. she was very sick.

742
01:09:09.666 --> 01:09:13.166
I voluntarily sold myself into the brothel
to pay for her treatment.

743
01:09:15.666 --> 01:09:17.500
But she died eventually.

744
01:09:17.583 --> 01:09:20.083
My fate was pretty much sealed.

745
01:09:20.166 --> 01:09:21.916
until Aunt Lin saved me.

746
01:09:22.708 --> 01:09:23.875
You see…

747
01:09:25.166 --> 01:09:27.000
Life doesn't give you a choice.

748
01:09:28.750 --> 01:09:30.583
Fate chooses you.

749
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.250
Don't leave!

750
01:09:41.958 --> 01:09:43.541
I've lost Hong.

751
01:09:44.833 --> 01:09:46.666
I don't want to lose you as well.

752
01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:48.333
Then you have to choose.

753
01:09:48.416 --> 01:09:49.458
Me.

754
01:09:50.583 --> 01:09:51.583
or Lin.

755
01:10:45.208 --> 01:10:46.875
Oh my God. that poor woman.

756
01:10:46.958 --> 01:10:48.583
Who killed her?

757
01:10:48.666 --> 01:10:50.458
Did she get a stroke or something?

758
01:10:50.541 --> 01:10:54.833
That's Sau?
God. what's gonna happen to Tam?

759
01:11:22.125 --> 01:11:24.541
-What are you doing?
-Where do you think you're going?

760
01:11:24.625 --> 01:11:26.708
-Back to living under the bridge…
-Shut up!

761
01:11:29.833 --> 01:11:31.083
You know what?

762
01:11:31.166 --> 01:11:32.583
I used to be like you.

763
01:11:33.166 --> 01:11:34.750
I had dreams.

764
01:11:34.833 --> 01:11:38.083
then everything was taken away from me.
pushing me down to the bottom.

765
01:11:38.166 --> 01:11:41.625
You think I still trust you? Still fall
for the false ideals you made up

766
01:11:41.708 --> 01:11:44.083
for a rogue like you to hide behind?

767
01:11:44.166 --> 01:11:45.708
You don't have to trust me…

768
01:11:45.791 --> 01:11:46.708
But think about it.

769
01:11:46.791 --> 01:11:50.708
They got to Sau.
When do you think they will get to Thanh?

770
01:11:59.166 --> 01:12:00.750
You have to choose.

771
01:12:00.833 --> 01:12:04.208
Either you come with me and finish this.
or live your whole life hiding.

772
01:12:30.791 --> 01:12:32.833
<i>When the path ahead is a dead end.</i>

773
01:12:32.916 --> 01:12:35.083
<i>darkness becomes the safest place.</i>

774
01:12:35.916 --> 01:12:38.000
<i>The only way for me now…</i>

775
01:12:38.083 --> 01:12:39.500
<i>is to face the darkness.</i>

776
01:13:08.833 --> 01:13:10.625
Are you sure about this?

777
01:13:11.333 --> 01:13:13.166
After this. there's no going back.

778
01:13:13.958 --> 01:13:17.791
No matter what you do. Hoang
and your son won't come back to life.

779
01:13:20.791 --> 01:13:21.791
You can forgive.

780
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.083
but I can't.

781
01:13:26.083 --> 01:13:29.250
He has to pay for what he did
to my family.

782
01:13:31.416 --> 01:13:33.666
They move at 12:00 a.m. tonight.

783
01:13:34.541 --> 01:13:35.833
Be careful.

784
01:13:36.583 --> 01:13:38.625
Give this suitcase to A Thoong.

785
01:13:38.708 --> 01:13:42.708
Tell him to honor our deal.
Give me his strongest men.

786
01:13:47.666 --> 01:13:50.041
Hey. Minh. Where's Lin?

787
01:15:48.875 --> 01:15:51.250
Jacqueline. that bitch!

788
01:15:51.333 --> 01:15:53.000
Wanna fuck with me?

789
01:15:53.083 --> 01:15:55.625
Let's see who's gonna get fucked now.

790
01:17:35.125 --> 01:17:36.125
Where's Lin?

791
01:17:39.291 --> 01:17:40.625
Stick to the plan.

792
01:18:21.041 --> 01:18:22.250
You see…

793
01:18:22.333 --> 01:18:24.666
Every time Jacqueline
crawls out of her grave.

794
01:18:24.750 --> 01:18:26.458
I'll put her down again.

795
01:18:33.083 --> 01:18:34.541
Boss. what about them?

796
01:18:40.333 --> 01:18:43.458
What are you waiting for? All of you.

797
01:18:43.541 --> 01:18:45.833
-Kill them!
-Let's go.

798
01:18:49.208 --> 01:18:51.000
You! Get Son back here!

799
01:18:51.083 --> 01:18:52.041
Yes. boss.

800
01:18:54.625 --> 01:18:55.750
Piece of cake.

801
01:18:55.833 --> 01:18:58.833
Boss. can I get a hit?

802
01:19:00.833 --> 01:19:01.666
Yes?

803
01:19:04.458 --> 01:19:06.000
Be right back.

804
01:19:06.083 --> 01:19:07.666
Long. that son of a bitch!

805
01:21:05.583 --> 01:21:07.041
Bi!

806
01:21:55.041 --> 01:21:56.541
Thanh.

807
01:21:56.625 --> 01:21:57.541
are you okay?

808
01:22:05.250 --> 01:22:06.583
We have to finish this.

809
01:22:07.541 --> 01:22:08.458
For Hong.

810
01:22:16.583 --> 01:22:18.583
Boss. Son will be here soon.

811
01:22:19.416 --> 01:22:22.791
Motherfuckers!
Can't fucking get anything done!

812
01:22:22.875 --> 01:22:26.958
-Fuck! Always got everything fucked up!
-Brother. please. give me some.

813
01:22:27.041 --> 01:22:28.291
You wanna get jacked up?

814
01:22:29.583 --> 01:22:31.166
See those two?

815
01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:34.500
Fucking go down there
and kill those damn girls for me.

816
01:22:34.583 --> 01:22:36.375
I'll have you high for life!

817
01:22:37.291 --> 01:22:38.375
Kill…

818
01:22:39.125 --> 01:22:39.958
Kill…

819
01:22:54.541 --> 01:22:55.958
Kill those two for me!

820
01:23:57.125 --> 01:23:57.958
Long.

821
01:23:58.833 --> 01:24:01.083
Where's Hai? Where are they?

822
01:24:01.666 --> 01:24:03.458
You're late. Son.

823
01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:06.541
He's got to pay for what he did.

824
01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.166
So do you.

825
01:24:13.291 --> 01:24:14.833
I get it now.

826
01:24:14.916 --> 01:24:18.041
You sent me on a fool's errand to Lin's.
Motherfucking snitch!

827
01:25:23.791 --> 01:25:24.958
Fuck you!

828
01:26:28.708 --> 01:26:30.041
Looking for Son?

829
01:26:44.416 --> 01:26:45.416
Why?

830
01:26:46.750 --> 01:26:48.625
Why are you doing this? Huh?

831
01:26:50.166 --> 01:26:51.375
Why?

832
01:26:51.458 --> 01:26:52.416
It was me.

833
01:26:56.625 --> 01:26:57.791
Fate's on your side. huh!

834
01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:01.416
You should have died yesterday.

835
01:27:06.083 --> 01:27:07.291
You know what?

836
01:27:08.916 --> 01:27:11.833
I've been waiting this day for five years…

837
01:27:11.916 --> 01:27:13.833
to spill your blood on my husband's grave.

838
01:27:16.958 --> 01:27:19.666
<i>I have been watching your every move.</i>

839
01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:21.708
<i>Your men are mine.</i>

840
01:27:40.041 --> 01:27:41.958
Do you know to get here…

841
01:27:43.750 --> 01:27:45.625
how much I had to sacrifice?

842
01:28:07.833 --> 01:28:09.666
If he didn't betray me.

843
01:28:10.625 --> 01:28:14.083
you would never have been able
to touch one hair on my head!

844
01:28:15.625 --> 01:28:17.083
And here I thought…

845
01:28:17.166 --> 01:28:20.291
we're blood brothers!

846
01:28:21.458 --> 01:28:24.583
You haven't the slightest idea
what that word means.

847
01:28:24.666 --> 01:28:25.916
I'm not betraying you.

848
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.000
I just want you to feel what Hoang felt.

849
01:28:29.083 --> 01:28:32.666
Back then. you once said that to Hoang.

850
01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:35.875
Then you went on
and murdered him brutally.

851
01:28:35.958 --> 01:28:37.791
You don't fucking have brothers.

852
01:28:37.875 --> 01:28:39.958
All that matters to you is money.

853
01:28:42.250 --> 01:28:44.583
Don't you know what money is?

854
01:28:45.916 --> 01:28:47.583
Money is power.

855
01:28:47.666 --> 01:28:51.000
If you don't have money.
how can you keep your turf?

856
01:28:51.083 --> 01:28:54.000
If you don't have money.
who the fuck is gonna listen to you?

857
01:29:03.166 --> 01:29:05.000
Good speech. Hai.

858
01:29:05.083 --> 01:29:06.375
Go on then.

859
01:29:08.833 --> 01:29:10.416
Do you know why he's dead?

860
01:29:12.916 --> 01:29:16.500
He's dead because that day he didn't
stop you from killing my husband.

861
01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:21.208
You killed my husband for money.
for this territory.

862
01:29:21.291 --> 01:29:22.333
that. I understand.

863
01:29:22.416 --> 01:29:24.166
But what about my child?

864
01:29:29.166 --> 01:29:31.083
He's just a kid.

865
01:29:35.083 --> 01:29:36.625
What did he ever do to you

866
01:29:37.375 --> 01:29:38.958
that you have to kill him?

867
01:29:40.416 --> 01:29:41.250
Huh?

868
01:29:43.166 --> 01:29:44.000
Huh?

869
01:29:44.083 --> 01:29:45.375
Fuck!

870
01:29:53.208 --> 01:29:55.208
Lin. please. Lin…

871
01:29:55.291 --> 01:29:58.625
I didn't kill Hoang. I didn't kill him.

872
01:29:58.708 --> 01:30:00.416
It was Nam's idea.

873
01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:02.583
And your son was…

874
01:30:02.666 --> 01:30:04.791
an accident.

875
01:30:04.875 --> 01:30:06.666
An accident?

876
01:30:07.333 --> 01:30:10.625
Now that you're here.
I'll give you back this turf.

877
01:30:10.708 --> 01:30:11.750
-Shh…
-You…

878
01:30:13.541 --> 01:30:14.625
You talk too much.

879
01:30:17.916 --> 01:30:19.000
You scared now?

880
01:30:19.875 --> 01:30:21.416
Rest assured.

881
01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:23.333
This territory is now mine.

882
01:30:24.583 --> 01:30:27.333
And I'll always mark your words.

883
01:30:27.416 --> 01:30:28.875
If you wanna be boss.

884
01:30:30.708 --> 01:30:32.250
you gotta have the balls.

885
01:30:33.791 --> 01:30:34.916
Can't be a pussy.

886
01:30:36.125 --> 01:30:37.375
And have no mercy!

887
01:30:52.916 --> 01:30:54.083
It's over.

888
01:30:54.875 --> 01:30:57.375
From now on. Thanh and me owe you nothing!

889
01:30:58.416 --> 01:30:59.416
Let's go.

890
01:31:00.916 --> 01:31:01.916
Wait.

891
01:31:05.666 --> 01:31:06.875
I'm not done yet.

892
01:31:07.541 --> 01:31:09.333
This territory is now mine.

893
01:31:11.458 --> 01:31:12.625
Where do you think…

894
01:31:13.541 --> 01:31:14.708
you can go?

895
01:31:15.583 --> 01:31:16.416
Huh?

896
01:31:22.708 --> 01:31:23.958
Thanh.

897
01:31:24.041 --> 01:31:25.083
Kill her.

898
01:31:26.125 --> 01:31:28.458
You said you completely trust in me.

899
01:31:29.833 --> 01:31:31.458
You said I was your family.

900
01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.041
Then kill her.

901
01:31:36.166 --> 01:31:37.791
Kill her and go home with me.

902
01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.333
You were the one who saved my life.

903
01:32:09.541 --> 01:32:11.541
I never forget that.

904
01:32:13.958 --> 01:32:16.833
All these years.
I've done everything you told me to.

905
01:32:17.666 --> 01:32:19.208
No question asked.

906
01:32:20.916 --> 01:32:22.958
Hong died.

907
01:32:23.041 --> 01:32:25.083
I still followed you.

908
01:32:25.166 --> 01:32:26.875
Turns out all you've ever wanted

909
01:32:26.958 --> 01:32:28.625
is hatred and murder.

910
01:32:30.750 --> 01:32:33.750
You have never considered me your family.

911
01:32:39.666 --> 01:32:41.750
This is the last time
I'll ever listen to you.

912
01:32:47.416 --> 01:32:48.333
Bi.

913
01:32:50.208 --> 01:32:51.625
I'm sorry.

914
01:32:52.875 --> 01:32:54.208
I have to make a choice now.

915
01:33:31.333 --> 01:33:32.500
It's okay.

916
01:33:32.583 --> 01:33:33.583
You'll be fine.

917
01:33:34.250 --> 01:33:35.166
It's okay.

918
01:33:35.958 --> 01:33:37.125
I'll take you home.

919
01:33:38.208 --> 01:33:39.791
I'll take you home.

920
01:33:39.875 --> 01:33:41.333
See. my fate is sealed.

921
01:33:44.583 --> 01:33:45.958
No…

922
01:33:46.041 --> 01:33:47.458
We can change our fate.

923
01:33:58.916 --> 01:34:02.166
You will always be my sister.

924
01:34:04.250 --> 01:34:05.458
Thanh! Thanh!

925
01:34:44.416 --> 01:34:47.041
A fitting end for those who chose wrong.

926
01:36:20.333 --> 01:36:23.416
I thought you were strong enough
to play at my level.

927
01:36:26.333 --> 01:36:28.041
Turns out you aren't quite there yet.

928
01:36:40.125 --> 01:36:42.750
You're in this mud too deep.
you'll never get out.

929
01:36:45.291 --> 01:36:46.791
If I'm deep in this mud…

930
01:36:52.500 --> 01:36:54.541
I'll never let you escape it.

931
01:38:47.833 --> 01:38:48.833
Well played.

932
01:38:51.791 --> 01:38:53.083
Law of the jungle. right?

933
01:38:56.416 --> 01:38:58.708
Survival of the fittest.

934
01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:18.583
At this point…

935
01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.208
there's no turning back for you.

936
01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.250
<i>Choices are never easy.</i>

937
01:40:20.833 --> 01:40:23.750
<i>We often think we've made the right one.</i>

938
01:40:23.833 --> 01:40:27.375
<i>Turns out.</i>
<i>we made the wrong choices all along.</i>

939
01:40:27.458 --> 01:40:28.583
Luong.

940
01:40:28.666 --> 01:40:31.416
Make an evidence log of this crime scene.

941
01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:32.416
Yes. sir.

942
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.958
<i>What's important is that</i>
<i>we're ready to pay the price.</i>

943
01:40:58.333 --> 01:41:00.708
Hey. miss? Miss?

944
01:41:01.625 --> 01:41:04.083
Sir. this woman is still alive!
Please send a medic!
