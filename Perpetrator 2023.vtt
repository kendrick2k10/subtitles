3
00:01:50.075 --> 00:01:55.632
Oh... hey...
what are you doing out here?

4
00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:23.488
Deep breaths now. Evelyn.

5
00:02:23.626 --> 00:02:25.904
And stay very still.

6
00:02:27.664 --> 00:02:33.463
This is very bad.
but it can always get worse.

7
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.707
Girls like you

8
00:02:35.845 --> 00:02:37.329
just don't know
what you've got

9
00:02:37.467 --> 00:02:39.228
till it's all gone.

10
00:05:58.254 --> 00:06:00.394
What do you got?

11
00:06:01.568 --> 00:06:03.328
A signed first edition
of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>.

12
00:06:03.466 --> 00:06:07.677
I'm more of
a <i>Jane Eyre</i> person myself.

13
00:06:07.815 --> 00:06:08.816
Do you want it or not?

14
00:06:08.954 --> 00:06:09.852
Let me see.

15
00:06:23.762 --> 00:06:25.005
No. I'm... I'm gonna
need more than this.

16
00:06:25.143 --> 00:06:26.627
I'm trying to get
out of this place.

17
00:06:26.765 --> 00:06:27.904
What else you got?

18
00:06:32.253 --> 00:06:33.841
Nothing.

19
00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:36.534
Oh. No. you got somethin'.

20
00:06:38.708 --> 00:06:41.055
No. No. not this time.

21
00:06:41.193 --> 00:06:43.057
Jesus. Kit! I said no!

22
00:06:43.195 --> 00:06:44.887
-  [grunts] Oh!

23
00:06:45.025 --> 00:06:48.062
Go on. Cherry Pop...
just try to get outta here.

24
00:08:12.077 --> 00:08:13.631
You're late.

25
00:08:13.769 --> 00:08:14.908
I got rent.

26
00:08:16.392 --> 00:08:18.083
How?

27
00:08:18.221 --> 00:08:19.188
Cleaning houses.

28
00:08:23.537 --> 00:08:25.539
You want it? Or you want to
go live in the van again?

29
00:08:45.697 --> 00:08:47.527
What?

30
00:08:47.665 --> 00:08:49.632
Nothing.

31
00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:52.014
I like what you've done
with your face.

32
00:09:57.355 --> 00:09:58.736
She's a great girl.

33
00:09:58.874 --> 00:10:00.220
Isn't she?

34
00:10:00.358 --> 00:10:05.018
The moment she was born.
I knew she was special...

35
00:10:05.156 --> 00:10:06.329
I looked at her little face.

36
00:10:06.467 --> 00:10:10.299
all slimy and speckled
with blood.

37
00:10:10.437 --> 00:10:15.235
and I told her.
"You are so special."

38
00:10:20.792 --> 00:10:22.035
You feel me?

39
00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:15.813
Gene!

40
00:11:18.332 --> 00:11:19.920
Gene!

41
00:11:29.205 --> 00:11:30.655
Dad. Dad.

42
00:11:41.631 --> 00:11:43.012
So how was your day?

43
00:11:45.981 --> 00:11:47.154
I left work early

44
00:11:47.292 --> 00:11:49.605
so I could get lunch
with your mom.

45
00:11:49.743 --> 00:11:50.951
How was your day?

46
00:11:53.574 --> 00:11:56.508
My
chemistry teacher got fired

47
00:11:56.646 --> 00:11:58.131
for that thing that happened
last spring

48
00:11:58.269 --> 00:12:02.135
which I didn't tell you about.

49
00:12:02.273 --> 00:12:04.206
What did you and Mom
talk about at lunch?

50
00:12:06.277 --> 00:12:07.623
We talked
about how your birthday

51
00:12:07.761 --> 00:12:10.143
is coming up.
and what we're gonna get you.

52
00:12:10.281 --> 00:12:11.765
Your mom's got
a great gift idea.

53
00:12:11.903 --> 00:12:14.043
You're going to love it.

54
00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.391
Can I get a hint?

55
00:12:19.152 --> 00:12:22.742
Nope.
Don't go trying to find it.

56
00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.642
You know how
she likes to hide things.

57
00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.540
You know how she hides.

58
00:12:34.581 --> 00:12:37.101
Who the fuck
are you talking to?

59
00:12:38.792 --> 00:12:40.656
Nobody.

60
00:12:40.794 --> 00:12:43.279
Get the fuck out of here!

61
00:12:54.704 --> 00:12:55.982
I counted that money.

62
00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.604
It's all there!

63
00:12:57.742 --> 00:12:58.916
There was extra.

64
00:12:59.054 --> 00:13:01.090
so I thought
I might order a pizza.

65
00:13:09.271 --> 00:13:10.272
Okay.

66
00:13:20.558 --> 00:13:23.492
<i>[on TV] Is that
my dress you are wearing?</i>

67
00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:26.529
<i>
No. This is my dress.</i>

68
00:13:31.672 --> 00:13:32.984
<i>Can I try it on?</i>

69
00:13:35.711 --> 00:13:38.093
<i>
Let me try on that dress!</i>

70
00:13:41.303 --> 00:13:42.752
<i>
Thanks for the ride. Mister--</i>

71
00:13:42.891 --> 00:13:44.271
<i>[on TV] Who's that girl
back there?</i>

72
00:13:45.548 --> 00:13:47.585
<i>
Her name is Lejend with a J.</i>

73
00:13:49.449 --> 00:13:50.519
<i>[on TV] You like her?</i>

74
00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:53.073
<i>
She dates someone older.</i>

75
00:13:53.211 --> 00:13:55.179
<i>An out-of-towner.</i>

76
00:13:55.317 --> 00:13:57.008
<i>[on TV] She's pretty.</i>

77
00:13:57.146 --> 00:13:58.320
<i>
She's all right.</i>

78
00:14:00.529 --> 00:14:02.220
<i>
You're pretty too.</i>

79
00:14:03.601 --> 00:14:04.774
<i>Very pretty.</i>

80
00:14:06.121 --> 00:14:08.468
<i>You know. I probably won't
see you again after tonight.</i>

81
00:14:11.609 --> 00:14:13.818
All of it.

82
00:14:13.956 --> 00:14:16.648
I don't know
what to do with her.

83
00:14:22.965 --> 00:14:25.830
<i>Please. Hildie. Help me.</i>

84
00:14:27.038 --> 00:14:30.110
<i>She'll be 18 next week.
You know what that means.</i>

85
00:14:31.905 --> 00:14:35.495
<i>I can't. I...
I can't do this right now.</i>

86
00:14:35.633 --> 00:14:36.876
<i>I'm not myself.</i>

87
00:14:37.946 --> 00:14:39.361
Does she know
anything at all?

88
00:14:41.018 --> 00:14:41.984
<i>She's been asking about</i>

89
00:14:42.122 --> 00:14:43.537
<i>her mother again lately.</i>

90
00:14:43.675 --> 00:14:44.918
<i>What did you tell her</i>

91
00:14:45.056 --> 00:14:47.058
<i>about her mother?</i>

92
00:14:47.196 --> 00:14:49.405
<i>Girls go missing
all the time.</i>

93
00:14:49.543 --> 00:14:54.307
<i>Gone and never ever found...
especially new moms...</i>

94
00:14:54.445 --> 00:14:57.241
I ju--I just need some time
to sort myself out.

95
00:14:57.379 --> 00:14:58.967
Put her on the train.

96
00:14:59.105 --> 00:15:03.488
I'll meet her at the station.
You pull yourself together.

97
00:15:22.611 --> 00:15:25.752
You're early.
Or maybe I'm late.

98
00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:28.893
Either way. I wanted to
meet you at the station.

99
00:15:29.031 --> 00:15:32.655
You should not be walking
around here alone. Jonquil.

100
00:15:34.278 --> 00:15:36.970
My friends call me Johnny.

101
00:15:37.108 --> 00:15:38.972
We are not friends.

102
00:15:46.531 --> 00:15:48.602
You look so much
like your mother.

103
00:15:50.742 --> 00:15:53.124
I wouldn't know.

104
00:15:53.262 --> 00:15:56.300
What did Gene tell you
about this arrangement?

105
00:15:56.438 --> 00:15:58.854
Just that I had to
come here and stay with you

106
00:15:58.992 --> 00:16:03.445
while he pulls himself
together or whatever.

107
00:16:03.583 --> 00:16:05.343
He's such a fuckup.

108
00:16:05.481 --> 00:16:08.519
You don't think
he's trying his best?

109
00:16:08.657 --> 00:16:11.694
He's not trying.
He's not trying at all.

110
00:16:11.832 --> 00:16:13.144
What about you?

111
00:16:15.457 --> 00:16:16.458
I try.

112
00:16:18.667 --> 00:16:20.289
I try really hard.

113
00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:24.052
You'll be 18 soon.

114
00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:27.814
Next week.
I had plans.

115
00:16:27.952 --> 00:16:29.367
What kind of plans?

116
00:16:31.024 --> 00:16:34.372
I don't know. It was
going to be a surprise.

117
00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:36.754
I have a surprise
for you too.

118
00:16:36.892 --> 00:16:37.893
And a cake.

119
00:16:38.031 --> 00:16:39.550
I hate cake.

120
00:16:39.688 --> 00:16:42.863
Well. you haven't
had my cake.

121
00:16:53.771 --> 00:16:55.497
Are you okay?

122
00:16:55.635 --> 00:16:58.293
Yeah. yeah. I just...
I just bit my tongue.

123
00:17:10.995 --> 00:17:11.823
<i>Any allergies?</i>

124
00:17:11.961 --> 00:17:12.859
<i>No.</i>

125
00:17:12.997 --> 00:17:13.825
<i>Any medications?</i>

126
00:17:13.963 --> 00:17:15.275
<i>No.</i>

127
00:17:15.413 --> 00:17:16.552
Any family history
of debilitating

128
00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:19.176
or life-threatening
bodily ailments?

129
00:17:19.314 --> 00:17:20.349
I think
there might be something

130
00:17:20.487 --> 00:17:22.420
very wrong with Gene.

131
00:17:24.836 --> 00:17:25.768
Who is Gene?

132
00:17:25.906 --> 00:17:27.253
My dad.

133
00:17:27.391 --> 00:17:31.119
He's just never seemed
all that comfortable.

134
00:17:31.257 --> 00:17:33.293
Comfort is overrated.

135
00:17:33.431 --> 00:17:34.398
Where's your mother?

136
00:17:34.536 --> 00:17:35.847
Not in the picture.

137
00:17:38.022 --> 00:17:39.541
You wear glasses...

138
00:17:39.679 --> 00:17:40.645
No.

139
00:17:43.096 --> 00:17:44.132
You need glasses.

140
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:45.305
No. I don't.

141
00:17:45.443 --> 00:17:48.274
Read that.

142
00:17:49.654 --> 00:17:51.070
Line 11. please.

143
00:17:52.381 --> 00:17:55.833
P-E-Z-O-L-C-F-T-D.

144
00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:00.976
How old are you?

145
00:18:01.114 --> 00:18:02.288
Seventeen.

146
00:18:05.325 --> 00:18:07.189
You have the eyes
of someone much older.

147
00:18:25.518 --> 00:18:26.519
You'll need a note
from a cardiologist

148
00:18:26.657 --> 00:18:29.038
if you want to play sports.

149
00:18:29.177 --> 00:18:31.248
- Why?
- Your heart condition.

150
00:18:31.386 --> 00:18:33.457
I don't have
a heart condition.

151
00:18:33.595 --> 00:18:34.734
Murmurs aren't very serious.

152
00:18:34.872 --> 00:18:37.254
but I've never heard one
like yours.

153
00:18:37.392 --> 00:18:38.496
It's like you have
two hearts.

154
00:18:38.634 --> 00:18:40.257
at least. if not three.

155
00:18:43.087 --> 00:18:45.089
When was the first day
of your last menstruation?

156
00:18:45.227 --> 00:18:46.780
Um... yesterday.

157
00:18:46.918 --> 00:18:48.403
Are you sexually active?

158
00:18:48.541 --> 00:18:50.577
What do you mean
by that. exactly?

159
00:18:52.372 --> 00:18:53.822
Are you currently
or consistently

160
00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.444
engaged in behavior
that includes

161
00:18:55.582 --> 00:18:56.514
any part of your body

162
00:18:56.652 --> 00:18:57.964
coming into intimate contact

163
00:18:58.102 --> 00:18:59.345
with another person's body?

164
00:18:59.483 --> 00:19:00.863
Skin on skin?

165
00:19:01.001 --> 00:19:01.864
- Yes.
- Tongues?

166
00:19:02.002 --> 00:19:02.865
- Yes.
- Fingers?

167
00:19:03.003 --> 00:19:03.970
- Yes.
- Head?

168
00:19:04.108 --> 00:19:05.074
Yes! Yes.
All of that.

169
00:19:05.213 --> 00:19:06.524
Everything private.

170
00:19:11.633 --> 00:19:13.013
Are you doing any of that?

171
00:19:13.152 --> 00:19:14.325
What if I am?

172
00:19:14.463 --> 00:19:15.637
You would be assigned
a counselor.

173
00:19:15.775 --> 00:19:16.741
Okay. then no.

174
00:19:16.879 --> 00:19:18.053
Can you prove it?

175
00:19:18.191 --> 00:19:19.296
For sure.

176
00:19:22.264 --> 00:19:23.610
One last question.

177
00:19:26.889 --> 00:19:27.925
Are you popular?

178
00:19:29.754 --> 00:19:32.585
On a scale of "no one would
miss you if you disappeared"

179
00:19:32.723 --> 00:19:34.863
to "everyone would do anything

180
00:19:35.001 --> 00:19:37.900
just to be you
even for just one day."

181
00:19:41.525 --> 00:19:43.182
No one would ever
want to be me.

182
00:19:45.011 --> 00:19:45.943
Hm...

183
00:19:54.469 --> 00:19:55.711
Gold star.

184
00:21:15.895 --> 00:21:17.448
You must give what you get.

185
00:21:17.586 --> 00:21:19.554
Synchronize.

186
00:21:19.692 --> 00:21:22.764
Mirror your partner exactly.

187
00:21:25.836 --> 00:21:28.321
If they stop breathing.
you stop breathing.

188
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:57.074
I'm trying
to talk to the one

189
00:21:57.212 --> 00:21:58.834
with the long blonde hair.

190
00:21:58.972 --> 00:21:59.904
Aviva.

191
00:22:01.768 --> 00:22:03.322
But all the other ones
are available.

192
00:22:06.359 --> 00:22:07.533
Argh.

193
00:22:35.802 --> 00:22:37.563
What's for lunch?

194
00:22:41.705 --> 00:22:44.777
It's. uh...
dead rabbit.

195
00:22:48.056 --> 00:22:49.022
You gonna keep it?

196
00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.058
How can I?

197
00:22:50.196 --> 00:22:51.024
You need a coat hanger?

198
00:22:51.162 --> 00:22:52.094
You got one?

199
00:23:01.449 --> 00:23:03.140
I saw you this morning.

200
00:23:03.278 --> 00:23:05.176
Second period AP Trig.

201
00:23:05.314 --> 00:23:06.488
You're new.

202
00:23:07.731 --> 00:23:09.698
That teacher
got my name wrong.

203
00:23:09.836 --> 00:23:12.425
Yeah. well. he does that
with all the girls.

204
00:23:23.954 --> 00:23:25.783
You didn't
have to wait for me.

205
00:23:25.921 --> 00:23:28.959
Yes. I did.
Why were you late?

206
00:23:29.097 --> 00:23:31.064
I was with
the school nurse.

207
00:23:31.202 --> 00:23:33.170
She got kind of personal.

208
00:23:33.308 --> 00:23:34.930
How did you do?

209
00:23:35.068 --> 00:23:36.138
Gold star.

210
00:23:36.276 --> 00:23:38.934
- Really?
- Yep.

211
00:23:39.072 --> 00:23:41.247
Does cunnilingus
still count?

212
00:23:41.385 --> 00:23:43.111
- Yep.
- What a shame.

213
00:23:45.631 --> 00:23:48.530
This fucking uniform
doesn't fit.

214
00:23:48.668 --> 00:23:50.670
I felt so stupid
at school today.

215
00:23:50.808 --> 00:23:53.017
I stayed in the bathroom
most of the day.

216
00:23:53.155 --> 00:23:55.675
I know. How did you
tolerate the smell?

217
00:23:55.813 --> 00:23:58.091
I got used to it.

218
00:25:03.881 --> 00:25:06.539
I got blood on the rug.

219
00:25:06.677 --> 00:25:08.023
It's okay.

220
00:25:08.161 --> 00:25:09.680
It's nothing.

221
00:25:09.818 --> 00:25:12.614
It's tough to get out
but I can do it.

222
00:25:32.427 --> 00:25:36.017
This is exactly where
you should be. you know.

223
00:25:37.881 --> 00:25:39.538
Is it familiar?

224
00:25:40.573 --> 00:25:41.712
No.

225
00:25:43.334 --> 00:25:45.302
Not at all?

226
00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.614
Why should it be?

227
00:25:47.856 --> 00:25:49.306
You've been here before.

228
00:25:54.449 --> 00:25:55.830
I'll be right back.

229
00:26:06.668 --> 00:26:09.878
Girls. girls. girls...

230
00:26:10.016 --> 00:26:11.777
I could have
a daughter your age.

231
00:26:11.915 --> 00:26:15.815
A young
and vulnerable pet.

232
00:26:15.953 --> 00:26:19.163
just like any one of you.

233
00:26:19.301 --> 00:26:24.065
I wish I could protect you.
Hold you away from harm.

234
00:26:24.203 --> 00:26:27.068
Such a cruel world.

235
00:26:29.518 --> 00:26:33.592
You girls are so vibrant
and full of potential.

236
00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:36.491
with not one real
care or concern.

237
00:26:36.629 --> 00:26:39.287
You're not prepared
for what might happen next.

238
00:26:39.425 --> 00:26:44.292
Danger lurks
around every corner.

239
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:49.884
Your survival depends on
you and only you.

240
00:26:50.022 --> 00:26:51.023
Ha!

241
00:26:53.059 --> 00:26:54.889
Assume that you are not
ever safe.

242
00:26:57.098 --> 00:26:59.203
Now for you girls.
in particular.

243
00:26:59.341 --> 00:27:01.999
today will begin
a series of training sessions

244
00:27:02.137 --> 00:27:05.175
which will include
basic self-defense

245
00:27:05.313 --> 00:27:08.143
and other general
survival skills.

246
00:27:09.558 --> 00:27:12.665
Now...
Let's play prisoner. huh?

247
00:27:46.561 --> 00:27:47.458
Code Massacre.

248
00:27:47.596 --> 00:27:48.874
<i>Level Bloodbath.</i>

249
00:27:49.012 --> 00:27:52.291
<i>I repeat. Code Massacre.
Level Bloodbath.</i>

250
00:27:52.429 --> 00:27:55.328
<i>Proceed as though
this is an actual emergency.</i>

251
00:27:55.466 --> 00:27:56.364
<i>Escape!</i>

252
00:27:56.502 --> 00:27:58.055
<i>Evade! Engage!</i>

253
00:27:58.193 --> 00:27:59.747
<i>You are being tested.</i>

254
00:27:59.885 --> 00:28:01.231
<i>You are being timed.</i>

255
00:28:01.369 --> 00:28:03.198
You're going to
get us all killed!

256
00:28:03.336 --> 00:28:05.062
<i>You are not safe.
Some of you will not survive.</i>

257
00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.926
<i>Stay calm
and do not think about</i>

258
00:28:07.064 --> 00:28:09.515
<i>friends or family
in other rooms;</i>

259
00:28:09.653 --> 00:28:12.104
<i>they may already be dead.</i>

260
00:28:14.209 --> 00:28:17.212
Escape! Evade! Engage!

261
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:21.423
Most of you are
going to die today!

262
00:28:29.155 --> 00:28:31.779
Whooh! You're dead.

263
00:28:31.917 --> 00:28:33.194
All four of you are dead.

264
00:28:33.332 --> 00:28:36.231
That's four dead
in Mrs. Danver's classroom!

265
00:28:38.889 --> 00:28:39.959
Hi. Principal Burke.

266
00:28:40.097 --> 00:28:42.030
Girls. girls. girls.

267
00:28:42.168 --> 00:28:45.068
I have to put all four
of your names in my report.

268
00:28:45.206 --> 00:28:46.552
This is the second time
you three

269
00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:48.485
have been killed
this semester.

270
00:28:48.623 --> 00:28:51.453
Have you ever been shot
here at school before today?

271
00:28:51.591 --> 00:28:52.627
No.

272
00:28:52.765 --> 00:28:54.146
Well. this news
is going to be

273
00:28:54.284 --> 00:28:56.458
very disappointing
for your parents.

274
00:28:58.219 --> 00:29:01.118
Escape! Evade! Engage!

275
00:29:01.256 --> 00:29:02.292
Ugh!

276
00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:03.707
The last time
I got gunned down.

277
00:29:03.845 --> 00:29:04.639
my mom grounded me
for a week.

278
00:29:04.777 --> 00:29:05.951
Me too.

279
00:29:06.089 --> 00:29:06.917
My parents are gonna
slaughter me

280
00:29:07.055 --> 00:29:08.160
for getting killed again.

281
00:29:08.298 --> 00:29:09.540
Fuck!
This is all your fault.

282
00:29:09.678 --> 00:29:10.541
I can fix it.

283
00:29:10.679 --> 00:29:12.026
You can fix it?

284
00:29:12.164 --> 00:29:14.338
I find that guy's report.
I take the report.

285
00:29:14.476 --> 00:29:17.065
I change the report.
I return the report.

286
00:29:17.203 --> 00:29:19.481
Why would you help us?

287
00:29:19.619 --> 00:29:21.656
This is strictly business.

288
00:29:21.794 --> 00:29:24.141
Be back here tomorrow
with cash.

289
00:29:24.279 --> 00:29:25.591
or else you're dead...

290
00:29:25.729 --> 00:29:27.248
again.

291
00:30:17.712 --> 00:30:19.610
Stay out of my stuff.

292
00:30:19.748 --> 00:30:22.613
This is not your stuff.

293
00:30:22.751 --> 00:30:24.167
You want me
to give it back?

294
00:30:24.305 --> 00:30:26.548
I want you to eat it.

295
00:30:26.686 --> 00:30:28.654
Eat what?

296
00:30:28.792 --> 00:30:30.483
Pick something
and eat it.

297
00:30:32.831 --> 00:30:34.246
No!

298
00:30:34.384 --> 00:30:39.078
What you did
was stupid and selfish.

299
00:30:39.216 --> 00:30:41.529
Trust me. a girl like you

300
00:30:41.667 --> 00:30:45.257
cannot afford to be
stupid and selfish.

301
00:30:45.395 --> 00:30:49.261
No one is going to
miss any of this!

302
00:30:49.399 --> 00:30:52.264
Would you prefer that
I pick something for you?

303
00:31:40.795 --> 00:31:44.109
Stay out of my stuff.

304
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:47.698
Not a chance.

305
00:32:29.464 --> 00:32:31.742
Do I look normal to you?

306
00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:33.572
Absolutely not.

307
00:32:34.745 --> 00:32:38.128
I mean. do I look the same
as I did yesterday?

308
00:32:38.266 --> 00:32:39.888
I feel weird...

309
00:32:40.027 --> 00:32:41.304
weirder.

310
00:32:41.442 --> 00:32:43.030
I mean. yesterday.
you were the victim

311
00:32:43.168 --> 00:32:45.101
of a fake mass murder...

312
00:32:45.239 --> 00:32:47.448
but otherwise.
you look the same to me.

313
00:32:47.586 --> 00:32:48.863
Hm.

314
00:32:49.001 --> 00:32:50.520
That's new.

315
00:32:50.658 --> 00:32:54.041
Hm. My great-aunt
gave it to me.

316
00:32:54.179 --> 00:32:55.180
I live with her now.

317
00:32:55.318 --> 00:32:56.491
What did you tell her

318
00:32:56.629 --> 00:32:57.665
about your clothes
from yesterday?

319
00:32:57.803 --> 00:32:58.942
She didn't notice.

320
00:32:59.080 --> 00:32:59.978
Yeah.
Mine didn't notice either.

321
00:33:00.116 --> 00:33:01.255
Me neither.

322
00:33:01.393 --> 00:33:03.947
Fuck me!
My mom noticed right away.

323
00:33:04.085 --> 00:33:06.087
She was furious at first.

324
00:33:06.225 --> 00:33:07.399
So I had to lie to her

325
00:33:07.537 --> 00:33:09.677
and told her
I fought off an attacker.

326
00:33:09.815 --> 00:33:11.437
She's obsessed with
those missing girls.

327
00:33:11.575 --> 00:33:14.130
She stayed in my bed with me
last night. sobbing.

328
00:33:14.268 --> 00:33:15.959
That's fucking disgusting.

329
00:33:16.097 --> 00:33:18.997
Jesus! Girls go missing
all the time.

330
00:33:19.135 --> 00:33:21.102
I mean.
what's the big deal?

331
00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:22.552
They're gonna
ruin everything.

332
00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:25.796
They're gonna
ruin everything?!

333
00:33:25.934 --> 00:33:29.110
If I start to cry now.
I might not stop.

334
00:33:29.248 --> 00:33:30.594
I can't eat...

335
00:33:30.732 --> 00:33:33.701
which normally would be
awesome. of course.

336
00:33:33.839 --> 00:33:37.325
I imagine them lost.
then found.

337
00:33:37.463 --> 00:33:40.984
Living. then dead. Evelyn...

338
00:33:41.122 --> 00:33:44.712
Darby. April P.

339
00:33:47.094 --> 00:33:48.543
You're right.

340
00:33:48.681 --> 00:33:49.958
Girls go missing
all the time.

341
00:33:50.097 --> 00:33:52.064
I'm sure they're fine.

342
00:33:52.202 --> 00:33:53.928
And what about us?

343
00:33:54.066 --> 00:33:55.619
Are we okay?

344
00:33:55.757 --> 00:33:57.138
Did you fix that thing
from yesterday

345
00:33:57.276 --> 00:33:58.381
like you said you would?

346
00:33:58.519 --> 00:34:00.659
Did you bring the cash?

347
00:34:10.703 --> 00:34:12.188
Is that my lipstick
you're wearing?

348
00:34:12.326 --> 00:34:13.844
Hatchet Wound.

349
00:34:13.982 --> 00:34:15.432
Pussy Galore.

350
00:34:57.716 --> 00:34:59.856
Happy birthday.

351
00:34:59.994 --> 00:35:01.202
Aren't you gonna sing?

352
00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:03.308
I only know
one song by heart.

353
00:35:03.446 --> 00:35:06.552
but I don't like to
sing it alone.

354
00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:11.074
You can make a wish.
but you should know

355
00:35:11.212 --> 00:35:13.973
I already made one for you.

356
00:35:14.112 --> 00:35:15.665
It's a tradition.

357
00:35:15.803 --> 00:35:18.219
That seems cruel.

358
00:35:18.357 --> 00:35:21.326
You have no idea.

359
00:35:25.606 --> 00:35:27.608
Cake?

360
00:35:27.746 --> 00:35:30.335
No. Thanks.

361
00:35:59.743 --> 00:36:01.849
"You can make a wish.
but you should know

362
00:36:01.987 --> 00:36:04.852
that I have already
made one for you."

363
00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:09.546
What the fuck?

364
00:39:42.069 --> 00:39:45.244
You owe me a new toilet.

365
00:39:45.383 --> 00:39:48.938
What was in that cake?

366
00:39:49.076 --> 00:39:54.392
It's an old family recipe.
Tell me what happened.

367
00:39:57.049 --> 00:40:00.432
I was in the bathroom.
of course.

368
00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:02.848
I got dizzy.

369
00:40:02.986 --> 00:40:07.335
Then I heard this girl
crying out for me

370
00:40:07.474 --> 00:40:11.132
from like. miles away.

371
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:16.275
She was pulling me
closer and closer.

372
00:40:16.414 --> 00:40:17.898
<i>Help me.</i>

373
00:40:18.036 --> 00:40:19.520
I couldn't get to her though.

374
00:40:19.658 --> 00:40:22.661
I couldn't help her.

375
00:40:24.663 --> 00:40:26.562
We have to find that girl.

376
00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:28.495
Maybe we should
call somebody.

377
00:40:28.633 --> 00:40:33.465
Don't call anyone. ever.

378
00:40:33.603 --> 00:40:35.605
You're not going to die
from this.

379
00:40:35.743 --> 00:40:38.401
What is this?

380
00:40:38.539 --> 00:40:40.472
I call it Forevering.

381
00:40:42.716 --> 00:40:47.479
It's profound
spectral empathy.

382
00:40:47.617 --> 00:40:52.104
You are one in a long line.

383
00:40:52.242 --> 00:40:59.111
We are proxies.
surrogates. mimics.

384
00:40:59.249 --> 00:41:04.772
mirrors.
We turn. we fake.

385
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:08.155
we follow. we bend.

386
00:41:08.293 --> 00:41:15.542
we shift. we shape.
we tune way in.

387
00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:17.854
Am I contagious?

388
00:41:17.992 --> 00:41:21.168
No.
It's the other way around.

389
00:41:21.306 --> 00:41:27.485
A kind of...
possession in reverse.

390
00:41:27.623 --> 00:41:33.387
We are women
feeling all the feelings.

391
00:41:33.525 --> 00:41:34.802
Why us?

392
00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:37.736
It's not just us.
There are others.

393
00:41:37.874 --> 00:41:42.534
Some we know.
Others we don't know.

394
00:41:42.672 --> 00:41:44.640
And we can pass it along.

395
00:41:44.778 --> 00:41:48.298
but that must be done
very judiciously.

396
00:41:48.436 --> 00:41:50.680
It's a very powerful gift

397
00:41:50.818 --> 00:41:53.476
handed down to the women
in this family

398
00:41:53.614 --> 00:41:56.203
on their 18th birthday.

399
00:41:56.341 --> 00:42:01.001
It would have happened to you
without the cake.

400
00:42:01.139 --> 00:42:05.143
That's just fuel
for the fury.

401
00:42:07.386 --> 00:42:08.905
What can you do?

402
00:42:09.043 --> 00:42:12.012
I'm quite something...

403
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:21.021
ferocious. repulsive. magnificent.

404
00:42:21.159 --> 00:42:24.093
I've been buried alive twice.

405
00:42:24.231 --> 00:42:26.785
What about my mom?
What was she like?

406
00:42:26.923 --> 00:42:31.963
Mm... a fiend's fiend.

407
00:42:32.101 --> 00:42:33.412
Still?

408
00:42:33.551 --> 00:42:35.104
Still.

409
00:42:35.242 --> 00:42:38.141
Is this going to
keep happening to me?

410
00:42:38.279 --> 00:42:40.765
Forever and ever.

411
00:43:09.276 --> 00:43:11.865
"The neural basis may be
a cell that reacts

412
00:43:12.003 --> 00:43:14.143
"both when
a particular action

413
00:43:14.281 --> 00:43:18.112
"is performed
and when it is observed.

414
00:43:19.597 --> 00:43:22.392
"As for understanding
the functional significance

415
00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:24.809
"of mirror neurons.

416
00:43:24.947 --> 00:43:27.605
that journey has only
just begun."

417
00:43:53.147 --> 00:43:55.080
Oh. hey.

418
00:43:55.218 --> 00:43:57.013
What are you doing out here?

419
00:44:05.056 --> 00:44:08.059
There you are.
You fucking bitch!

420
00:44:08.197 --> 00:44:11.062
You lied to us
about fixing that report.

421
00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:15.066
We're all still dead.
We want our money back.

422
00:44:18.241 --> 00:44:21.417
I had to give Hildie
your money

423
00:44:21.555 --> 00:44:23.350
to replace her toilet.

424
00:44:23.488 --> 00:44:25.283
But I--I can pay you back.

425
00:44:25.421 --> 00:44:26.836
In cash?

426
00:44:26.974 --> 00:44:29.218
Not exactly.
What else do you want?

427
00:44:29.356 --> 00:44:31.047
I can get you
anything else you want.

428
00:44:31.185 --> 00:44:33.601
Booze. shoes. jewelry.

429
00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:35.465
makeup. whatever.

430
00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:39.746
What's that smell?

431
00:44:39.884 --> 00:44:40.988
I don't know.

432
00:44:43.266 --> 00:44:47.305
It's Evelyn.
She smells just like Evelyn.

433
00:44:52.586 --> 00:44:55.244
<i>
Code Pink. Pale Pink.</i>

434
00:44:55.382 --> 00:44:59.248
<i>All senior girls report
to the gym immediately.</i>

435
00:45:08.982 --> 00:45:10.984
What's new with you?

436
00:45:14.642 --> 00:45:18.060
Mm. I didn't have
any lunch money today.

437
00:45:18.198 --> 00:45:20.683
so I sold my underwear
to the student teacher

438
00:45:20.821 --> 00:45:22.616
for Civic Engagement.

439
00:45:22.754 --> 00:45:24.929
The blood-stained ones.

440
00:45:25.067 --> 00:45:26.447
I charged double.

441
00:45:27.897 --> 00:45:29.416
That's not what I meant.

442
00:45:34.662 --> 00:45:36.837
It's weird.

443
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:39.909
It's only been
a couple of days

444
00:45:40.047 --> 00:45:46.916
and I've watched my face
turn into another face.

445
00:45:47.054 --> 00:45:51.196
My voice was her voice too.

446
00:45:51.334 --> 00:45:56.995
And I could feel her blood
leaving her body.

447
00:45:57.962 --> 00:45:59.687
And she's alive.

448
00:45:59.826 --> 00:46:01.551
I just don't know
where she is.

449
00:46:02.621 --> 00:46:04.658
I don't feel
like you're in any pain.

450
00:46:04.796 --> 00:46:07.454
I'm not in pain. but I'm not
all that interested

451
00:46:07.592 --> 00:46:09.767
in feeling all the feelings.

452
00:46:10.871 --> 00:46:12.804
I don't mind being me.

453
00:46:12.942 --> 00:46:15.289
You're still you.

454
00:46:15.427 --> 00:46:19.604
All the feelings
are not your feelings.

455
00:46:19.742 --> 00:46:20.985
Not yet.

456
00:46:21.123 --> 00:46:24.609
I've inherited
turbo-charged empathy.

457
00:46:24.747 --> 00:46:26.645
I'm like
super sensitive now.

458
00:46:26.784 --> 00:46:30.442
So it's kind of uncomfortable.

459
00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:33.618
It's been different
for each of us.

460
00:46:33.756 --> 00:46:38.105
Emotional basket-case
is a tremendous asset though.

461
00:46:38.243 --> 00:46:42.006
and when harnessed can be
quite an efficient weapon.

462
00:46:42.144 --> 00:46:44.146
Show me how to use it.

463
00:46:44.284 --> 00:46:46.907
You're going to have to
figure this out on your own.

464
00:46:47.045 --> 00:46:51.774
You'll learn it.
You'll learn to work it.

465
00:46:51.912 --> 00:46:54.915
You may or may not
learn to like it.

466
00:46:55.053 --> 00:46:56.468
It's evolved and mutated

467
00:46:56.606 --> 00:47:00.472
so you can surely do tricks
that no one else can do.

468
00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:03.268
There are some limitations.
of course.

469
00:47:03.406 --> 00:47:07.410
Like I said. that's for you
to figure out for yourself.

470
00:47:07.548 --> 00:47:10.862
For me. it requires
reasonable proximity

471
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.037
and a clear path.

472
00:47:13.175 --> 00:47:18.249
If you can see me.
I can feel you.

473
00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:21.597
Does my dad know
anything about this?

474
00:47:21.735 --> 00:47:24.945
I don't know exactly
what your dad knows.

475
00:47:25.083 --> 00:47:26.913
Have you talked to him?

476
00:47:27.051 --> 00:47:31.227
I call.
He doesn't answer.

477
00:47:59.946 --> 00:48:01.671
I'd fear me...

478
00:48:01.809 --> 00:48:03.363
I'd fuck me...

479
00:48:07.712 --> 00:48:10.542
She's nothing like you.

480
00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:13.269
I didn't expect that.

481
00:48:13.407 --> 00:48:15.099
<i>Have you talked to her?</i>

482
00:48:15.237 --> 00:48:18.171
I call. She doesn't answer.

483
00:48:18.309 --> 00:48:19.758
<i>What do I do?</i>

484
00:48:19.897 --> 00:48:24.660
Get real.
You get really real.

485
00:48:24.798 --> 00:48:28.906
<i>She's here with me
and we're going through it.</i>

486
00:48:29.044 --> 00:48:33.117
You've got to
pull yourself together.

487
00:48:33.255 --> 00:48:34.566
<i>That was the deal.</i>

488
00:48:49.374 --> 00:48:50.789
Let's try it again.
from the top.

489
00:48:50.928 --> 00:48:52.067
I wasn't paying attention.

490
00:48:52.205 --> 00:48:52.964
Okay. do it again.
- So. it's up.

491
00:48:53.102 --> 00:48:54.103
Up.

492
00:48:54.241 --> 00:48:55.001
-  Cross.
- Cross.

493
00:48:55.139 --> 00:48:56.830
Hit and out.

494
00:48:56.968 --> 00:48:58.004
You're late.

495
00:48:58.142 --> 00:48:59.350
Where the fuck is Aviva?

496
00:48:59.488 --> 00:49:00.765
Kirk was supposed to
drop her off.

497
00:49:00.903 --> 00:49:01.800
Who the fuck is Kirk?

498
00:49:01.939 --> 00:49:03.492
He's so cute.

499
00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:05.977
He plays football
and basketball and baseball.

500
00:49:06.115 --> 00:49:07.737
And he's a good kisser.

501
00:49:07.875 --> 00:49:10.464
He uses his tongue.
I heard.

502
00:49:10.602 --> 00:49:12.639
Okay. Well. we're gonna have
to do this without Aviva.

503
00:49:12.777 --> 00:49:15.124
The family just left.
Are you sure about the alarm?

504
00:49:15.262 --> 00:49:16.298
Yeah. My dad's not
scheduled to fix it

505
00:49:16.436 --> 00:49:17.851
till like next weekend.

506
00:49:17.989 --> 00:49:18.886
Okay. I'm gonna go in.

507
00:49:19.025 --> 00:49:20.371
You two stay out here.

508
00:49:20.509 --> 00:49:22.028
If anything happens.
you know what to do.

509
00:49:22.166 --> 00:49:23.477
-  Mm-hm.
-  Okay.

510
00:49:23.615 --> 00:49:25.790
And I have the list of shit
that you want.

511
00:49:25.928 --> 00:49:26.964
After tonight. we're even?

512
00:49:27.102 --> 00:49:28.413
Yeah.

513
00:49:28.551 --> 00:49:30.622
Yeah.

514
00:49:50.711 --> 00:49:52.920
-  Okay. Come on.
-  Okay. let's go.

515
00:49:53.059 --> 00:49:54.163
Okay.

516
00:49:58.064 --> 00:50:00.100
Right here...

517
00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:03.069
cross.

518
00:50:04.622 --> 00:50:06.175
Ace.

519
00:50:10.904 --> 00:50:12.630
What are you two
doing out here?

520
00:50:12.768 --> 00:50:14.770
There's a new curfew.

521
00:50:14.908 --> 00:50:19.361
Earlier today. we found
one of the girls... dead.

522
00:50:19.499 --> 00:50:20.672
We think it's Evelyn Tufts.

523
00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:21.949
but her eyes and teeth
are missing

524
00:50:22.088 --> 00:50:23.641
along with her scalp.

525
00:50:23.779 --> 00:50:25.677
It wasn't my idea.

526
00:50:25.815 --> 00:50:28.025
Wasn't my idea either.

527
00:50:28.163 --> 00:50:30.268
Why don't you two girls
get in the car?

528
00:50:30.406 --> 00:50:32.477
Come on. get in the car.

529
00:50:32.615 --> 00:50:34.652
We've got spirit.
yes. we do.

530
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:38.483
We've got spirit.
how about you?

531
00:50:44.938 --> 00:50:46.008
I've got spirit.

532
00:50:46.146 --> 00:50:47.251
yes. I do.
-  [mocks] I do.

533
00:50:47.389 --> 00:50:48.355
I've got spirit...

534
00:50:48.493 --> 00:50:50.185
...how about you?!

535
00:51:08.824 --> 00:51:10.860
Hey.

536
00:51:10.998 --> 00:51:12.586
The back door's still open.

537
00:51:30.259 --> 00:51:32.158
You okay?

538
00:51:32.296 --> 00:51:35.022
What do you mean by okay?

539
00:51:35.161 --> 00:51:36.921
You see
what happened out here?

540
00:51:37.059 --> 00:51:38.543
What happened out there?

541
00:51:38.681 --> 00:51:40.752
I apprehended a prowler.

542
00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:47.311
A girl. A dangerous one.
She got away.

543
00:51:47.449 --> 00:51:49.865
There's a dangerous girl
out there somewhere?

544
00:51:52.281 --> 00:51:53.696
Stay inside tonight.

545
00:52:18.928 --> 00:52:20.413
Hey. I'm Elektra.

546
00:52:20.551 --> 00:52:22.311
I already know your name.
I asked around.

547
00:52:22.449 --> 00:52:23.864
I thought
you might need a doctor.

548
00:52:24.002 --> 00:52:27.523
but seems like you've
already stopped bleeding.

549
00:52:31.182 --> 00:52:32.287
That's somethin'.

550
00:52:35.945 --> 00:52:38.810
Would it be okay
if I stayed with you?

551
00:52:41.330 --> 00:52:42.814
Yeah.

552
00:52:51.927 --> 00:52:53.929
What'd your parents say?

553
00:52:54.067 --> 00:52:55.758
I told my aunt
that I was having a sleepover

554
00:52:55.896 --> 00:52:57.484
with a new friend.

555
00:52:57.622 --> 00:53:00.004
Will your parents care
that I'm here?

556
00:53:00.142 --> 00:53:01.592
If my mom even notices you.

557
00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:04.111
she'll just ask
where you live.

558
00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:05.458
what your parents do.

559
00:53:07.598 --> 00:53:11.084
Anyway. they'll be out
for a while.

560
00:53:11.222 --> 00:53:12.741
Hm.

561
00:53:12.879 --> 00:53:15.122
They went to a party
for the Mensahs.

562
00:53:15.261 --> 00:53:20.611
They just bought a new house.
It has an indoor pool.

563
00:53:20.749 --> 00:53:22.544
Mrs. Mensah just got
this thing done to her face

564
00:53:22.682 --> 00:53:24.028
that my mom really wants.

565
00:53:24.166 --> 00:53:28.722
so she and my dad went to get
a closer look.

566
00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:31.173
They aren't really friends. though.

567
00:53:31.311 --> 00:53:33.417
These grownups
just get shit-faced

568
00:53:33.555 --> 00:53:36.282
and complain
about their kids.

569
00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:37.973
Who would complain
about you?

570
00:53:41.563 --> 00:53:47.293
Well. my mom will say
that I'm spoiled and bitchy.

571
00:53:47.431 --> 00:53:48.949
My dad won't correct her.

572
00:53:51.228 --> 00:53:52.884
You still need
that coat hanger?

573
00:53:54.265 --> 00:53:55.646
No.

574
00:54:00.582 --> 00:54:02.239
Are you gonna
freak out again?

575
00:54:05.621 --> 00:54:08.383
Oh. I am definitely
going to freak out again.

576
00:56:04.119 --> 00:56:05.051
What is this?

577
00:56:05.189 --> 00:56:06.846
What does it look like?

578
00:56:06.984 --> 00:56:09.607
A mouthful of strawberry
bubblegum and Red Hots.

579
00:56:09.745 --> 00:56:14.267
chewed down. spit out.
and drying up?

580
00:56:14.405 --> 00:56:16.925
It's my miscarriage.

581
00:56:17.063 --> 00:56:21.032
I was gonna bury it
in the backyard last night.

582
00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:22.482
Take this from me.

583
00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:24.691
that is not something
you should do alone.

584
00:56:24.829 --> 00:56:27.901
Well. he doesn't know
anything about it.

585
00:56:28.039 --> 00:56:29.213
Your boyfriend?

586
00:56:29.351 --> 00:56:31.491
He's not my boyfriend.

587
00:56:31.629 --> 00:56:33.182
He's just some guy
that I tutor

588
00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:35.771
in math and chemistry.

589
00:56:35.909 --> 00:56:40.500
He's cute... for a boy.

590
00:56:40.638 --> 00:56:44.090
He plays football
and basketball and baseball.

591
00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:47.611
He's a good kisser.

592
00:56:49.164 --> 00:56:51.028
Kirk with the tongue?

593
00:56:51.166 --> 00:56:53.202
Do you know him?

594
00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:54.514
Mm-mm.

595
00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:00.589
Do you want to talk about it?

596
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:07.700
We usually
meet at the library.

597
00:57:07.838 --> 00:57:10.357
But this time.
we met at his house.

598
00:57:10.496 --> 00:57:11.566
His parents were gone.

599
00:57:11.704 --> 00:57:13.878
and so.
we drank a couple beers.

600
00:57:14.016 --> 00:57:15.604
I dunno. I think I just
wanted to get it over with.

601
00:57:15.742 --> 00:57:17.641
you know. see what
all the fuss was about.

602
00:57:17.779 --> 00:57:20.609
Like if dick
only happens for me once.

603
00:57:20.747 --> 00:57:22.818
it might as well be with him.

604
00:57:22.956 --> 00:57:24.302
And?

605
00:57:24.441 --> 00:57:28.928
It was not totally terrible.
but dick is not for me.

606
00:57:30.447 --> 00:57:32.828
Afterwards. Kirk just
kind of passed out.

607
00:57:32.966 --> 00:57:35.072
so I decided to walk home.

608
00:57:36.729 --> 00:57:39.628
And as soon as
I left his house.

609
00:57:39.766 --> 00:57:42.286
a man started following me.

610
00:57:42.424 --> 00:57:44.115
I couldn't really make out
the details of his face.

611
00:57:44.253 --> 00:57:45.772
but he may have been
wearing a mask.

612
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:48.879
like a mask
that looks like a face.

613
00:57:49.017 --> 00:57:50.501
And I could see
at the end of the street.

614
00:57:50.639 --> 00:57:52.192
there was a cop car. so
I started walking toward it.

615
00:57:52.330 --> 00:57:54.781
like faster and faster.
even though fuck cops.

616
00:57:54.919 --> 00:57:57.439
but the man started walking
faster too.

617
00:57:57.577 --> 00:57:58.751
When I finally reached
the cop car.

618
00:57:58.889 --> 00:58:01.029
my whole body
just heaves forward.

619
00:58:01.167 --> 00:58:03.894
The cop looks up.
we lock eyes and then...

620
00:58:05.689 --> 00:58:07.276
it happened.

621
00:58:07.414 --> 00:58:09.106
The man grabbed you
and knocked you out

622
00:58:09.244 --> 00:58:11.108
and shoved you
into the cop car?

623
00:58:12.765 --> 00:58:15.630
I barfed.

624
00:58:15.768 --> 00:58:18.529
It was an explosion of barf.

625
00:58:18.667 --> 00:58:20.566
That cop was the same cop
from last night.

626
00:58:20.704 --> 00:58:21.981
Did he recognize you?

627
00:58:22.119 --> 00:58:25.122
There was something
in the way he asked.

628
00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:26.503
"Are you okay?"

629
00:58:26.641 --> 00:58:28.643
Aviva was supposed to
show last night

630
00:58:28.781 --> 00:58:32.163
but the other girls said
that she was with Kirk.

631
00:58:32.301 --> 00:58:33.993
Kirk hooked up
with Darby and April P.

632
00:58:34.131 --> 00:58:36.754
before they disappeared. too.

633
00:58:36.892 --> 00:58:39.964
Hey. did you hear
that they found Evelyn?

634
00:58:41.414 --> 00:58:42.898
He was with her too.

635
00:58:43.036 --> 00:58:45.625
She was really
hacked up. I guess.

636
00:58:45.763 --> 00:58:48.007
Even her eyes were gone.

637
00:58:48.145 --> 00:58:52.149
Like...
everyone wanted her eyes.

638
00:58:53.806 --> 00:58:57.430
You and me.
we should talk to Kirk.

639
00:58:57.568 --> 00:58:59.156
find out what he knows.

640
00:59:15.793 --> 00:59:20.418
Evelyn. Darby.
April P. and now Aviva.

641
00:59:20.557 --> 00:59:21.488
Aviva?!

642
00:59:21.627 --> 00:59:22.973
Where is she. pretty boy?

643
00:59:23.111 --> 00:59:24.491
Where are all those girls?

644
00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:26.666
I don't know!

645
00:59:26.804 --> 00:59:33.811
Help me! Help me!

646
00:59:33.949 --> 00:59:38.920
No. Ow.

647
00:59:39.058 --> 00:59:44.581
Ow. Ow. Ow.

648
00:59:44.719 --> 00:59:46.686
If you...
I'm sorry.

649
00:59:46.824 --> 00:59:50.448
I think... I think if we...
ow! Ow!

650
00:59:50.587 --> 00:59:55.384
It's not...
I think I don't like that.

651
00:59:55.522 --> 00:59:58.387
God!

652
00:59:58.525 --> 01:00:01.667
I told you already
to shut the fuck up.

653
01:00:01.805 --> 01:00:03.047
You're gonna ruin your face

654
01:00:03.185 --> 01:00:04.980
and you are nothing
without that face.

655
01:00:07.155 --> 01:00:09.606
I didn't speak for six weeks

656
01:00:09.744 --> 01:00:12.816
after my last procedure.
This. hm?

657
01:00:12.954 --> 01:00:14.093
No scarring.

658
01:00:16.198 --> 01:00:17.510
Now. I need
more of everything.

659
01:00:17.648 --> 01:00:18.822
so put an order in.

660
01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:21.134
and file it under
health and wellness.

661
01:00:22.998 --> 01:00:24.275
What do you do
with all that stuff?

662
01:00:24.413 --> 01:00:26.312
No more talking.

663
01:00:33.768 --> 01:00:35.459
<i>Remember. girls...</i>

664
01:00:35.597 --> 01:00:40.015
if you run. be prepared
to run forever.

665
01:00:40.153 --> 01:00:41.983
And if you get knocked down.
stay down.

666
01:00:42.121 --> 01:00:44.779
keep quiet.
and don't cry.

667
01:00:44.917 --> 01:00:46.746
Noise and movement
can provoke

668
01:00:46.884 --> 01:00:48.230
and incense the attacker.

669
01:00:48.368 --> 01:00:51.233
What is bad
can always get worse.

670
01:00:52.579 --> 01:00:53.857
Do you think this will help?

671
01:00:53.995 --> 01:00:55.790
It can't hurt.

672
01:00:55.928 --> 01:00:57.688
Watch what they do
with their mouths...

673
01:00:57.826 --> 01:00:59.759
the biting and screaming
might be an issue.

674
01:01:01.727 --> 01:01:03.107
All right now.

675
01:01:03.245 --> 01:01:06.283
Concentrate on the fear
and pain you live with

676
01:01:06.421 --> 01:01:07.629
every moment.

677
01:01:07.767 --> 01:01:10.425
Let it... paralyze you.

678
01:01:21.816 --> 01:01:23.093
The paralysis...

679
01:01:48.739 --> 01:01:50.189
Who are you?

680
01:01:50.327 --> 01:01:51.362
No one you know.

681
01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:55.435
Are you so sure?

682
01:01:57.472 --> 01:01:59.819
Okay. girls. Go. run...
go. go.

683
01:01:59.957 --> 01:02:02.891
Run for your lives. Run!

684
01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:20.012
Okay. we've got
like five hours

685
01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:22.083
until my mom realizes
her car is missing.

686
01:02:22.221 --> 01:02:24.879
She just passed out.
so that'll be two hours.

687
01:02:25.017 --> 01:02:27.226
then she'll be groggy
for another hour.

688
01:02:27.364 --> 01:02:29.676
And then she'll.
I don't know. take a shower.

689
01:02:29.815 --> 01:02:32.956
scarf-n-barf leftovers
or jack off.

690
01:02:33.094 --> 01:02:34.405
Or all of those.

691
01:02:38.271 --> 01:02:40.826
Oh. there he is.
There he is.

692
01:02:45.278 --> 01:02:47.487
I do not
want to go in there.

693
01:02:47.625 --> 01:02:49.351
Me neither.

They're all the same person.

709
01:04:26.414 --> 01:04:27.933
Well. he's different.
He's not a total douchebag.

710
01:04:28.071 --> 01:04:30.418
He's just kind of a dickhead.

711
01:04:32.385 --> 01:04:35.630
I know
those missing girls...

712
01:04:35.768 --> 01:04:37.287
I was with them all

713
01:04:37.425 --> 01:04:40.083
right before
they disappeared.

714
01:04:40.221 --> 01:04:43.431
But I don't know
what has happened to them...

715
01:04:43.569 --> 01:04:46.641
and I don't know
where they are...

716
01:04:46.779 --> 01:04:48.539
and I'm freaking out!

717
01:04:48.677 --> 01:04:51.508
Oh. my god.
Pull your shit together.

718
01:04:51.646 --> 01:04:53.337
If you didn't do anything.
you didn't do anything.

719
01:04:53.475 --> 01:04:55.443
But someone's paying
attention to your playlist.

720
01:04:55.581 --> 01:04:57.272
So what do I do?

721
01:04:59.585 --> 01:05:01.828
You need to put me
on that playlist.

722
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:14.013
We are going to fake
like we are into this.

723
01:05:14.151 --> 01:05:16.705
And if we do it right. afterward.

724
01:05:16.843 --> 01:05:20.571
I will be savagely
attacked and abducted.

725
01:05:20.709 --> 01:05:25.024
I really
don't want to do this.

726
01:05:26.681 --> 01:05:27.613
Trust me.

727
01:05:27.751 --> 01:05:29.304
I don't know you like that.

728
01:05:29.442 --> 01:05:34.275
Babe.

729
01:05:34.413 --> 01:05:37.692
Trust...
me.

730
01:05:37.830 --> 01:05:39.452
How do you do that?

731
01:05:39.590 --> 01:05:41.247
Are you...
What--what are you?

732
01:05:41.385 --> 01:05:43.284
I am
nobody like everyone else

733
01:05:43.422 --> 01:05:49.083
except I know exactly how
you are feeling right now.

734
01:05:51.361 --> 01:05:54.467
We have to keep it cool.

735
01:06:17.076 --> 01:06:20.183
So...
this is your secret spot?

736
01:06:24.187 --> 01:06:25.705
One of them.

737
01:06:28.467 --> 01:06:29.606
Well. where do you go?

738
01:06:29.744 --> 01:06:33.161
I don't have dates.

739
01:06:33.299 --> 01:06:38.339
Ugh.
Because you're terrifying?

740
01:06:40.375 --> 01:06:42.515
Dates are too much work.

741
01:06:42.653 --> 01:06:44.276
I'd rather just
get to the good stuff.

742
01:06:44.414 --> 01:06:46.519
Skip all the walking
and talking

743
01:06:46.657 --> 01:06:49.764
and whatever else
people do on dates.

744
01:06:53.319 --> 01:06:55.977
I don't mind the talking
and walking. actually.

745
01:06:56.115 --> 01:06:58.255
Why do you date
so many girls?

746
01:06:59.877 --> 01:07:04.606
Girls are just...
so fucking awesome.

747
01:07:04.744 --> 01:07:06.056
Hm.

748
01:07:07.126 --> 01:07:08.714
So you got any moves?

749
01:07:10.267 --> 01:07:13.408
Let me see.

750
01:07:13.546 --> 01:07:14.754
You want to see my moves?

751
01:07:14.892 --> 01:07:16.066
Mm-hm.

752
01:07:20.967 --> 01:07:22.038
Give me your hand.

753
01:07:26.559 --> 01:07:29.355
I'm going to write
something on your palm.

754
01:07:29.493 --> 01:07:31.426
and you have to try to guess
what it is.

755
01:07:32.703 --> 01:07:33.808
Close your eyes.

756
01:07:52.033 --> 01:07:54.173
I heard
you're a good kisser.

757
01:07:54.311 --> 01:07:56.589
You know what to do
with your tongue.

758
01:07:56.727 --> 01:07:57.728
I am.

759
01:07:59.558 --> 01:08:00.248
I do.

760
01:08:00.386 --> 01:08:01.732
Prove it.

761
01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:27.172
Are you trouble?

762
01:08:27.310 --> 01:08:31.176
No. No trouble at all.

763
01:08:31.314 --> 01:08:32.729
Then why are the cops here?

764
01:08:32.867 --> 01:08:33.799
Hm?

765
01:08:37.975 --> 01:08:39.253
Hi. Dad.

766
01:08:39.391 --> 01:08:41.427
Jesus. Kirk.

767
01:08:41.565 --> 01:08:42.911
I've been driving around
for an hour looking for you.

768
01:08:43.049 --> 01:08:44.741
and I called.

769
01:08:44.879 --> 01:08:47.123
It went
straight to voicemail.

770
01:08:47.261 --> 01:08:48.883
This isn't your usual spot.

771
01:08:51.299 --> 01:08:52.680
Who's your friend?

772
01:08:55.234 --> 01:08:58.168
We go to school together.
She's new.

773
01:08:58.306 --> 01:09:01.067
You look sort of
familiar to me. New Girl.

774
01:09:01.206 --> 01:09:02.483
Let me give you a ride home.

775
01:09:02.621 --> 01:09:03.829
- I can take her home.
-  Nope.

776
01:09:03.967 --> 01:09:07.384
You need to go
pick up your stepmom.

777
01:09:07.522 --> 01:09:10.836
Clinic called.
Her eyes are swollen shut.

778
01:09:10.974 --> 01:09:12.700
Said she's gonna look
like a teenager

779
01:09:12.838 --> 01:09:14.529
but she can't drive.

780
01:09:14.667 --> 01:09:16.255
Why can't you get her?

781
01:09:17.532 --> 01:09:20.156
She's not talking to me
right now.

782
01:09:20.294 --> 01:09:22.744
Come on. I'll take you home.

783
01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:28.164
I'll call you later
for a do-over?

784
01:09:44.214 --> 01:09:45.319
Sit up front.

785
01:09:46.803 --> 01:09:48.529
The back seat
smells like barf.

786
01:09:56.606 --> 01:09:58.297
What happened to your face?

787
01:09:58.435 --> 01:10:02.612
You should see the other guy.

788
01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:04.027
Hm.

789
01:10:04.165 --> 01:10:06.478
Isn't that what people say
when the other guy won?

790
01:10:06.616 --> 01:10:10.792
Well. this was
some kind of other guy...

791
01:10:14.106 --> 01:10:15.659
and she didn't win.

792
01:10:15.797 --> 01:10:17.247
She?

793
01:10:20.008 --> 01:10:21.389
More like an it.

794
01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:43.204
What the fuck
just happened?

795
01:10:43.342 --> 01:10:44.723
We gotta try again tomorrow.

796
01:10:46.690 --> 01:10:48.485
Well. you just let her go?

797
01:10:48.623 --> 01:10:50.970
I know that cop.
We should follow them.

798
01:10:51.108 --> 01:10:55.458
She's fine. That's my dad.
He's gonna take her home.

799
01:11:03.328 --> 01:11:04.777
Thanks for the ride.

800
01:11:04.915 --> 01:11:06.538
I'll wait
till you get inside.

801
01:11:08.436 --> 01:11:09.679
Hey.

802
01:11:12.198 --> 01:11:13.648
You get a gold star.

803
01:11:47.337 --> 01:11:49.788
You still owe me
from the last one.

804
01:11:49.926 --> 01:11:52.756
Marcy doesn't like her neck

805
01:11:52.894 --> 01:11:57.485
and she found a clinic that
will fix it as an outpatient.

806
01:11:57.623 --> 01:11:59.418
But they only take cash.

807
01:13:10.731 --> 01:13:11.801
Deep breaths...

808
01:13:13.561 --> 01:13:16.012
and stay very still.

809
01:13:16.150 --> 01:13:22.363
This is very bad. but it--
it can always get worse.

810
01:13:22.501 --> 01:13:28.231
The first time
is excruciating.

811
01:13:28.369 --> 01:13:33.029
but I advise you not to cry.

812
01:13:33.167 --> 01:13:37.343
There is nothing less
desirable in this ugly world

813
01:13:37.482 --> 01:13:40.208
than a young girl in tears.

814
01:14:11.032 --> 01:14:12.137
What?

815
01:14:15.243 --> 01:14:17.211
What the fuck is this?

816
01:14:18.902 --> 01:14:20.628
What the fuck
are you gonna do to me?

817
01:14:20.766 --> 01:14:22.527
No more talking!

818
01:14:22.665 --> 01:14:24.839
I don't have any money.
I'm just some girl.

819
01:14:24.977 --> 01:14:26.738
Shut the fuck up!

820
01:14:26.876 --> 01:14:28.671
Ugh!

821
01:14:33.365 --> 01:14:35.643
Fuck you!

822
01:14:35.781 --> 01:14:38.266
You act like you like it.

823
01:14:38.404 --> 01:14:40.545
You act like you like me.

824
01:14:43.962 --> 01:14:47.931
Now. try to relax...

825
01:14:48.069 --> 01:14:50.934
I am about to take
advantage of you.

826
01:16:01.073 --> 01:16:02.592
Get in here.
Get in here.

827
01:16:02.730 --> 01:16:03.731
Get in here.

828
01:16:05.043 --> 01:16:07.597
Be quiet. Please.

829
01:16:07.735 --> 01:16:10.013
You're safer under here.

830
01:16:10.151 --> 01:16:12.291
He's watching and listening.

831
01:16:19.851 --> 01:16:20.955
Aviva.

832
01:16:23.751 --> 01:16:24.925
And Darby.

833
01:16:26.443 --> 01:16:28.031
April P.

834
01:16:30.206 --> 01:16:31.517
You're all here.

835
01:16:31.656 --> 01:16:33.071
Except Evelyn.

836
01:16:33.209 --> 01:16:34.486
They took her out
a few days ago.

837
01:16:34.624 --> 01:16:37.247
She hasn't come back.

838
01:16:37.385 --> 01:16:39.974
Evelyn is dead.

839
01:16:40.112 --> 01:16:43.737
I heard she was
scalped and skinned.

840
01:16:43.875 --> 01:16:46.878
He took everything
he could from her.

841
01:16:47.016 --> 01:16:49.639
He's gonna do that to us too.

842
01:16:49.777 --> 01:16:51.572
This is a chop shop.

843
01:16:51.710 --> 01:16:54.368
We're being stripped
for parts.

844
01:17:10.453 --> 01:17:12.351
When he calls you
out of here. you just go.

845
01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:16.252
When you're
out there with him.

846
01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:20.463
no matter what.
don't fucking cry.

847
01:17:20.601 --> 01:17:23.604
What happens if you cry?

848
01:17:23.742 --> 01:17:25.261
He'll take your tongue.

849
01:17:29.368 --> 01:17:31.716
I'd fear me...

850
01:17:31.854 --> 01:17:34.822
I'd fuck me...

851
01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:37.825
How long has this
been going on for?

852
01:17:37.963 --> 01:17:39.793
Too long.

853
01:17:39.931 --> 01:17:41.657
April P. and Darby
need a doctor.

854
01:17:41.795 --> 01:17:44.211
I think their wounds
are infected.

855
01:17:44.349 --> 01:17:49.250
My fucking god.
You two look terrible.

856
01:17:51.701 --> 01:17:55.567
We have to
get out of here.

857
01:17:55.705 --> 01:17:58.777
How? There's only
one way in and one way out.

858
01:17:58.915 --> 01:18:01.573
We're already
as good as gone forever.

859
01:18:01.711 --> 01:18:03.575
I miss my mom.

860
01:18:03.713 --> 01:18:07.165
I'd fuck me...

861
01:18:11.272 --> 01:18:13.689
Do you have one of these?

862
01:18:13.827 --> 01:18:17.382
I have two. both at the
base of my spine.

863
01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:20.316
What happens if--
if you pull it out?

864
01:18:20.454 --> 01:18:22.836
Evelyn pulled hers out.

865
01:18:22.974 --> 01:18:25.390
It was like
a fountain of blood.

866
01:18:25.528 --> 01:18:27.047
I'm not sure if she knew
that would happen

867
01:18:27.185 --> 01:18:29.843
or if she was trying to die.

868
01:18:29.981 --> 01:18:33.191
We are all
going to survive this.

869
01:18:33.329 --> 01:18:36.677
But you have to help me
get this thing out.

870
01:18:36.815 --> 01:18:39.024
How the fuck
is that going to help?

871
01:18:39.162 --> 01:18:40.716
Fountain of blood.

872
01:18:43.753 --> 01:18:47.170
On three. yank this out.

873
01:18:47.308 --> 01:18:50.795
Stay under here until I say.

874
01:18:50.933 --> 01:18:57.733
"Code Massacre.
Level Bloodbath."

875
01:18:57.871 --> 01:18:59.251
Right?

876
01:18:59.389 --> 01:19:03.393
One. two. three.

877
01:19:20.617 --> 01:19:22.033
No!

878
01:21:19.288 --> 01:21:25.363
Code Massacre...

879
01:21:25.501 --> 01:21:28.228
Level Bloodbath!

880
01:21:31.265 --> 01:21:32.542
Come on.
-  Which way?

881
01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:33.854
I don't know.
I don't know.

882
01:21:33.992 --> 01:21:36.305
Just fucking go. Go!

883
01:22:21.212 --> 01:22:23.973
Oh. my god.
That's my dad.

884
01:22:24.111 --> 01:22:25.457
That's my dad's van.

885
01:22:28.944 --> 01:22:31.567
Get in the van.
Get in the van.

886
01:22:31.705 --> 01:22:35.778
That's my dad's van.
Who the fuck are you?!

887
01:22:35.916 --> 01:22:37.538
Girls. come on.
Get in!

888
01:22:37.676 --> 01:22:40.058
-  Oh. my god.
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

889
01:22:40.196 --> 01:22:41.957
Get in the van. Get in!

890
01:22:43.234 --> 01:22:44.960
Is this all of you?
-  Yes.

891
01:22:45.098 --> 01:22:46.651
Okay.

892
01:22:51.587 --> 01:22:54.659
Oh. girls. What must you
have been through?

893
01:22:54.797 --> 01:22:57.006
Oh. Oh. you smell so bad.

894
01:22:57.144 --> 01:22:58.283
How did you find us?

895
01:22:58.421 --> 01:23:00.044
I didn't. She did.

896
01:23:01.528 --> 01:23:04.980
I have a very keen
sense of smell.

897
01:23:05.118 --> 01:23:06.705
Who is she?

898
01:23:06.843 --> 01:23:08.155
Your mother.

899
01:23:11.572 --> 01:23:13.298
I owe you an explanation.

900
01:23:17.337 --> 01:23:18.407
What happened back there?

901
01:23:18.545 --> 01:23:21.272
Code Massacre...
Level Bloodbath.

902
01:23:21.410 --> 01:23:23.343
I pulled this
out of his chest.

903
01:23:24.516 --> 01:23:26.760
I was aiming for his heart.

904
01:24:19.088 --> 01:24:20.434
This used to be my room.

905
01:24:22.229 --> 01:24:25.405
There is a big bloodstain
on the mattress.

906
01:24:25.543 --> 01:24:26.647
Mm-hm.

907
01:24:28.684 --> 01:24:31.342
Your birth was complicated.

908
01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:35.277
I had a C-section.

909
01:24:35.415 --> 01:24:38.487
My incision came open
on day five.

910
01:24:38.625 --> 01:24:40.040
I came in here
to change my underwear

911
01:24:40.178 --> 01:24:46.874
and stood up and came apart
like a bean burrito.

912
01:24:47.012 --> 01:24:48.842
I bled all over everything.

913
01:24:50.913 --> 01:24:53.398
Why are you
wearing my clothes?

914
01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:58.265
My other clothes don't fit.

915
01:25:00.509 --> 01:25:02.752
I haven't been myself
for a long while.

916
01:25:04.133 --> 01:25:05.652
What do I call you?

917
01:25:06.756 --> 01:25:14.074
Jean. Same as before.
but with a J.

918
01:25:14.212 --> 01:25:16.145
Or you can call me Mom.

919
01:25:17.250 --> 01:25:19.148
We don't know
each other like that.

920
01:25:24.602 --> 01:25:26.742
You were hit by a car
when you were five.

921
01:25:28.433 --> 01:25:31.574
You were... you were going
after an ice cream truck

922
01:25:31.712 --> 01:25:33.576
for a push-up.

923
01:25:33.714 --> 01:25:35.130
You were in a body cast
for months

924
01:25:35.268 --> 01:25:36.407
and you missed
the part of first grade

925
01:25:36.545 --> 01:25:38.236
where you learn to
tell the time.

926
01:25:38.374 --> 01:25:40.825
Seventh grade.
you asked all the teachers

927
01:25:40.963 --> 01:25:44.380
to call you Jennifer.

928
01:25:44.518 --> 01:25:46.796
And you had two best friends
named Lana.

929
01:25:49.109 --> 01:25:51.146
Onions irritate your stomach.

930
01:25:51.284 --> 01:25:53.700
and peaches
make your tongue feel fat.

931
01:25:54.804 --> 01:25:55.909
You like the smell
of gasoline

932
01:25:56.047 --> 01:25:58.153
and the way I sing.

933
01:25:58.291 --> 01:26:00.155
but you never let me sing.

934
01:26:01.190 --> 01:26:05.470
I've been right with you
your whole life.

935
01:26:05.608 --> 01:26:07.541
I just looked
like someone else.

936
01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:15.963
How? Why?

937
01:26:16.101 --> 01:26:17.482
Who were you?

938
01:26:18.966 --> 01:26:20.313
Combination
of a few guys I knew

939
01:26:20.451 --> 01:26:22.177
around the time
you were born.

940
01:26:23.833 --> 01:26:28.113
When I turned 18.
I practiced constantly.

941
01:26:28.252 --> 01:26:30.046
Not just tuning in
other people

942
01:26:30.185 --> 01:26:33.326
but actually becoming them...

943
01:26:33.464 --> 01:26:36.605
passing entirely
as someone else.

944
01:26:36.743 --> 01:26:41.817
You were hiding from me
for all of these years.

945
01:26:41.955 --> 01:26:43.232
I'm sorry.

946
01:26:44.647 --> 01:26:47.443
I just meant to hide
from your father.

947
01:26:47.581 --> 01:26:49.445
Our relationship was...

948
01:26:50.757 --> 01:26:53.656
was a cruel experiment
to him.

949
01:26:56.003 --> 01:26:59.110
I didn't think he could
dislike someone more than me

950
01:26:59.248 --> 01:27:01.975
until you were born.

951
01:27:02.113 --> 01:27:04.288
So then we vanished.

952
01:27:04.426 --> 01:27:07.049
But I knew
he'd come after us.

953
01:27:07.187 --> 01:27:08.637
So I did what I could.

954
01:27:10.052 --> 01:27:14.850
He was looking for
a single Black mom.

955
01:27:14.988 --> 01:27:16.955
not a single white dad.

956
01:27:19.026 --> 01:27:22.237
I didn't expect
to like it so much.

957
01:27:22.375 --> 01:27:27.380
No lingering looks.
no come-ons. no...

958
01:27:27.518 --> 01:27:33.386
no unwanted touching.
No unwanted anything.

959
01:27:33.524 --> 01:27:36.423
But then I saw you
becoming a teenager.

960
01:27:36.561 --> 01:27:39.461
And I watched it all
happening to you.

961
01:27:39.599 --> 01:27:42.809
And I didn't just watch.
I-I-I could feel everything.

962
01:27:44.189 --> 01:27:45.570
Over the past few years.

963
01:27:45.708 --> 01:27:47.227
the only time I haven't
been in terrible pain

964
01:27:47.365 --> 01:27:49.264
is when I've been
knocked out.

965
01:27:51.818 --> 01:27:54.890
And I was afraid
you'd go looking for me.

966
01:27:56.443 --> 01:27:59.204
I was wrong to hide.

967
01:27:59.343 --> 01:28:01.068
And I certainly
haven't healed.

968
01:28:05.521 --> 01:28:07.730
I wish I could say
I did the best I could.

969
01:28:12.770 --> 01:28:14.737
It wasn't that awful.

970
01:28:14.875 --> 01:28:18.223
You weren't that much worse
than the other dads I know.

971
01:28:18.362 --> 01:28:20.018
And how's Hildie been?

972
01:28:20.156 --> 01:28:21.813
A fiend's fiend.

973
01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:29.856
You're gonna be okay.
You're all going to be okay.

974
01:28:29.994 --> 01:28:33.238
Growing bodies
are highly regenerative.

975
01:28:33.377 --> 01:28:35.689
especially yours.

976
01:28:35.827 --> 01:28:37.795
The only thing adults really
appreciate about young people

977
01:28:37.933 --> 01:28:40.763
is their ability
to bounce back.

978
01:28:42.593 --> 01:28:47.839
We still don't know
who he is. where he lives.

979
01:28:47.977 --> 01:28:50.290
Once we got out.
we just started running

980
01:28:50.428 --> 01:28:54.467
and didn't look back.

981
01:28:54.605 --> 01:28:57.780
Thanks for coming to get me.

982
01:28:59.575 --> 01:29:02.682
It's not easy for me
to be back here.

983
01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:07.031
I have a feeling
your dad is here somewhere.

984
01:29:08.584 --> 01:29:10.931
He's a monster.

985
01:29:11.069 --> 01:29:12.416
So am I.

986
01:29:14.935 --> 01:29:19.457
You're special.
You're so fucking special.

987
01:29:21.425 --> 01:29:22.771
Do you feel me?

988
01:29:24.289 --> 01:29:25.808
I feel you.

989
01:29:47.002 --> 01:29:50.005
Settle down.

990
01:29:52.594 --> 01:29:53.974
Settle down!

991
01:29:57.737 --> 01:29:59.497
Please.

992
01:30:00.809 --> 01:30:03.881
As you know.
we are here this afternoon

993
01:30:04.019 --> 01:30:07.712
to honor
these brave young women.

994
01:30:07.850 --> 01:30:12.545
who recently survived
an unspeakable ordeal.

995
01:30:12.683 --> 01:30:16.514
They were tortured
and brutalized.

996
01:30:16.652 --> 01:30:18.965
and narrowly escaped.

997
01:30:19.103 --> 01:30:21.864
We can only hope
that with time.

998
01:30:22.002 --> 01:30:24.591
they will be able to
put this all behind them.

999
01:30:24.729 --> 01:30:27.007
pretend the whole thing
never happened.

1000
01:30:27.145 --> 01:30:32.047
and go on to live
long and decent lives.

1001
01:30:32.185 --> 01:30:36.465
My stepson.
who most of you know.

1002
01:30:36.603 --> 01:30:38.674
has asked if
he can read a letter

1003
01:30:38.812 --> 01:30:40.504
he wrote to you girls.

1004
01:30:40.642 --> 01:30:41.919
Kirk?

1005
01:30:48.270 --> 01:30:50.755
Thanks. Marcy.

1006
01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:59.177
"Dear Darby.

1007
01:30:59.315 --> 01:31:01.145
"April P..

1008
01:31:01.283 --> 01:31:02.526
"Aviva.

1009
01:31:02.664 --> 01:31:04.113
"and Jonny--

1010
01:31:05.321 --> 01:31:08.946
"we are all so glad
that you are back.

1011
01:31:10.672 --> 01:31:12.812
"None of us can imagine

1012
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:14.814
how scared
you must have been...

1013
01:31:16.194 --> 01:31:19.163
you must have been
so fucking scared."

1014
01:31:22.891 --> 01:31:25.721
I'm going to find
whoever did this to you!

1015
01:31:28.759 --> 01:31:30.726
Who would kill Evelyn?

1016
01:31:33.660 --> 01:31:35.144
Poor Evelyn.

1017
01:31:38.285 --> 01:31:40.253
I should also mention here

1018
01:31:40.391 --> 01:31:42.255
that now my dad is missing.

1019
01:31:46.293 --> 01:31:50.435
Any information
on his disappearance

1020
01:31:50.574 --> 01:31:52.783
would be appreciated.

1021
01:31:55.855 --> 01:31:58.547
I thought it couldn't
get worse. but it did.

1022
01:32:14.529 --> 01:32:16.185
Fuck!

1023
01:32:16.323 --> 01:32:17.497
Fuck!

1024
01:32:17.635 --> 01:32:19.637
Fuck me.

1025
01:32:19.775 --> 01:32:20.949
Fuck!

1026
01:32:27.300 --> 01:32:28.197
Fuck me.

1027
01:32:28.335 --> 01:32:31.546
Fuck me! Ow. Fuck!

1028
01:32:31.684 --> 01:32:33.513
Fuck me!

1029
01:32:33.651 --> 01:32:35.619
Fuck me.

1030
01:32:38.449 --> 01:32:41.072
Oh. shit! Did I miss it?

1031
01:32:42.936 --> 01:32:45.490
Fuck me. Fuck me.

1032
01:32:45.629 --> 01:32:47.872
Fuck me. Fuck me.

1033
01:32:48.010 --> 01:32:51.600
Fuck me.

1034
01:32:58.469 --> 01:32:59.643
Oh. my god.

1035
01:32:59.781 --> 01:33:02.197
I knew
you'd come back to me.

1036
01:33:03.578 --> 01:33:06.684
Fuck me.

1037
01:33:10.930 --> 01:33:14.002
Fuck me.

1038
01:33:59.254 --> 01:34:01.497
You missed it.
He was there...

1039
01:34:01.636 --> 01:34:02.809
but he got away.

1040
01:34:04.362 --> 01:34:06.399
I know him.

1041
01:34:06.537 --> 01:34:07.814
I know him too.

1042
01:34:07.952 --> 01:34:08.988
You know him?

1043
01:34:09.126 --> 01:34:11.093
New face. new name...

1044
01:34:11.231 --> 01:34:13.682
same old spells.

1045
01:34:13.820 --> 01:34:15.166
I left him alive.

1046
01:34:21.310 --> 01:34:22.864
What the fuck
are we gonna do now?!

1047
01:34:23.002 --> 01:34:24.106
I don't fucking know.

1048
01:34:24.244 --> 01:34:25.970
and don't raise
your voice at me.

1049
01:34:31.010 --> 01:34:33.184
What a fucking disaster.

1050
01:34:33.322 --> 01:34:34.945
I am truly sorry.

1051
01:34:35.083 --> 01:34:36.878
I know how sorry you are.

1052
01:34:37.016 --> 01:34:39.052
I can feel your heart racing.

1053
01:34:41.468 --> 01:34:42.331
That's not me.

1054
01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:47.716
Oh. baby.
Come to Daddy.

1055
01:35:11.567 --> 01:35:12.810
Argh.

1056
01:35:26.962 --> 01:35:29.240
What do we do with this?

1057
01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:47.224
[yelling] Surprise!

1058
01:35:49.951 --> 01:35:53.540
Who wants cake?
I made it myself.

1059
01:35:55.059 --> 01:35:58.166
All right.
but you have to be okay

1060
01:35:58.304 --> 01:36:01.859
