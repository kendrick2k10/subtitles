what's happening now is.

I was on the stage.

340
00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.095
Couldn't sleep that night.

341
00:14:39.139 --> 00:14:42.882
I did it. oh. four. five times.
and then I stopped doin' it.

342
00:14:42.925 --> 00:14:44.492
'cause the last time
I had bombed.

343
00:14:44.535 --> 00:14:46.276
And I didn't go for.
like. a year and a half.

344
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.105
And-- 'Cause I was
just psychologically fragile.

345
00:14:49.149 --> 00:14:50.454
I'm not much better now.

346
00:14:50.498 --> 00:14:52.239
I never drink. and. uh.

347
00:14:52.282 --> 00:14:54.023
it was about ten below zero.

348
00:14:54.067 --> 00:14:56.199

I was drinkin'.

349
00:14:56.243 --> 00:14:57.984

and I was runnin' around

350
00:14:58.027 --> 00:15:00.247

ten below zero weather.

351
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:03.511

you know. focused.

352
00:15:03.554 --> 00:15:05.643

353
00:15:05.687 --> 00:15:08.951
and I didn't wanna bomb
in front of my friend.

354
00:15:08.995 --> 00:15:10.561
so I didn't go on that night.

355
00:15:10.605 --> 00:15:11.954
I was so nervous.
and I was literally--

356
00:15:11.998 --> 00:15:13.738
Because I'm like.

357
00:15:13.782 --> 00:15:16.437
"I'm about to go on stage
and fucking try comedy!"

358
00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.917
Like. you know
how you shit yourself

359
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.222
and it's sort of metaphoric? No.

360
00:15:19.266 --> 00:15:20.789
I was physically
shitting myself.

361
00:15:20.832 --> 00:15:22.660
Like.
"Yo. I can't stop shitting."

362
00:15:22.704 --> 00:15:26.012
I was so-- I was so--
I was so scared.

363
00:15:26.055 --> 00:15:27.665
And I came back the next night.

364
00:15:27.709 --> 00:15:30.451
and then I went on.
you know. by myself.

365
00:15:30.494 --> 00:15:32.061
and I did great.

366
00:15:32.105 --> 00:15:34.324
And it was like a drug.
It was like heroin.

367
00:15:34.368 --> 00:15:36.326
This was. uh.

368
00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:38.807
something better
than sex. money.

369
00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:40.504

370
00:15:41.114 --> 00:15:43.072

whatever I thought was funny

how weird it felt. uh.

377
00:15:58.783 --> 00:16:01.134

-My dad is. uh. Mr. T.
-[man] Yeah?

379
00:16:04.746 --> 00:16:07.749
Yeah. See. most people think
I'm lying when I say that.

380
00:16:07.792 --> 00:16:09.359
but I'm like.
"Why would I pick him?"

381
00:16:09.403 --> 00:16:11.187
Like. ugh!

382
00:16:11.231 --> 00:16:12.884
All the people
to lie about. like.

383
00:16:12.928 --> 00:16:14.843
I'm mad that my mom
picked him. you know?

384
00:16:14.886 --> 00:16:17.498
And. like. I was born
before The A-Teamcame out.

385
00:16:17.541 --> 00:16:19.152
so she did it for love.
not even money.

386
00:16:19.195 --> 00:16:20.980
-Like...
-[audience laughter]

387
00:16:21.023 --> 00:16:24.244
I had mistakenly texted
my father... [clears throat]

388
00:16:24.287 --> 00:16:26.898
...and I knew how to
make that into a joke.

389
00:16:26.942 --> 00:16:28.857
and that was
the only joke I had.

390
00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.033
so I thought I could
draw that joke out

391
00:16:31.077 --> 00:16:33.340
for three minutes.
and I did okay.

392
00:16:33.383 --> 00:16:35.603
They made me go first.
because I came late.

393
00:16:35.646 --> 00:16:38.693
[Paul Gilmartin] I remember
coming home from doing it.

394
00:16:38.736 --> 00:16:42.349
and. um. my parents were
watching The Tonight Show.

395
00:16:42.392 --> 00:16:45.743
and I just remember
just feeling really excited.

396
00:16:45.787 --> 00:16:48.703
really excited. because it--
it hadn't gone terribly.

397
00:16:48.746 --> 00:16:51.358
and that gave me--
that gave me hope.

398
00:16:51.401 --> 00:16:53.838
The only reason I didn't start
comedy as early as I wanted to.

399
00:16:53.882 --> 00:16:56.711
because you wanna please
your family. your parents.

400
00:16:56.754 --> 00:16:59.540
'Cause. you know. if nobody
in your family ever decided

401
00:16:59.583 --> 00:17:02.325
to be a comedian.
that's. like. the dumbest thing.

402
00:17:02.369 --> 00:17:05.589
If you're a Black guy in Chicago
living on the South Side.

403
00:17:05.633 --> 00:17:07.765
you might as well say
you were gonna be an alien.

404
00:17:07.809 --> 00:17:10.072
"Meaning what? Doing what?"
Stand-up!

405
00:17:10.116 --> 00:17:12.596
"No. you goin' to college."
So I went to Harold Washington.

406
00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.424
even though
I didn't really wanna go.

407
00:17:14.468 --> 00:17:16.383
I just went just to
please them for a year. and...

408
00:17:17.253 --> 00:17:19.125
and but then comedy
just kept calling me.

409
00:17:19.168 --> 00:17:20.952
I walked by the Lion's Den.

410
00:17:20.996 --> 00:17:23.042
'cause that's where
the Irving Park Brown Line was.

411
00:17:23.085 --> 00:17:26.132
and it said "Monday Comedy."
and I'd walk by it every day

412
00:17:26.175 --> 00:17:28.482
on my way to Bennigan's
on 150 South Michigan.

when I was 19 or 20.

507
00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:29.766
It was like being a rock star.

508
00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:31.159
I thought I'd start off
my show tonight

509
00:21:31.202 --> 00:21:32.943

I think we did
three shows on Saturdays.

530
00:22:26.127 --> 00:22:27.824
and the club was
packed to the point

531
00:22:27.868 --> 00:22:30.218
that people were violating
all kinds of fire rules.

532
00:22:30.261 --> 00:22:32.046
They were sitting in the aisles.

533
00:22:32.089 --> 00:22:33.743
Now. I wanna explain
something to you here.

534
00:22:33.787 --> 00:22:35.832
We have a group
of comedians here

535
00:22:35.876 --> 00:22:37.791
who work for almost nothing.

536
00:22:37.834 --> 00:22:40.968
And the comedians were getting--
The top act was getting $10.

537
00:22:41.011 --> 00:22:44.275
The reason he paid us such
a little. small amount of money.

538
00:22:44.319 --> 00:22:47.496
his exact quote was. "The less
money I pay you. the-- the less

539
00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:49.498
pressure's on you. and then
the better you're gonna do!

540
00:22:49.542 --> 00:22:51.761
So if I don't pay you a lot of
money. you're not gonna have

541
00:22:51.805 --> 00:22:53.415
a lot of pressure. and
you're gonna do a great show!"

542
00:22:53.459 --> 00:22:56.331
Not only was he barely
paying you anything.

543
00:22:56.375 --> 00:22:58.855
he wouldn't even
pay you after the show.

544
00:22:58.899 --> 00:23:02.729
You had to go out the following
Tuesday to get your money.

545
00:23:02.772 --> 00:23:05.166
Not cash. You have to dri--
have to drive to his house.

546
00:23:05.209 --> 00:23:06.776
and he would hand you
the check and go.

547
00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:08.865
"Listen. uh.
don't cash that 'til tomorrow."

548
00:23:08.909 --> 00:23:11.302
You're not even really
paying me enough to have

549
00:23:11.346 --> 00:23:13.392
car fare to get there.

550
00:23:13.435 --> 00:23:15.481
I think that was
his plan. you know?

551
00:23:15.524 --> 00:23:17.308
Just keep you broke enough
that you can't actually

552
00:23:17.352 --> 00:23:19.093
can't even get
out there to get the money.

553
00:23:19.136 --> 00:23:21.704
Fact. Jay probably owes me
about 40 or 50 bucks.

554
00:23:23.053 --> 00:23:26.840
Part of being a comedian
is not making a living.

555
00:23:26.883 --> 00:23:30.583
Part of being a comedian
is bombing on a regular basis.

556
00:23:30.626 --> 00:23:32.889
And if you're not comfortable
with those two things.

557
00:23:32.933 --> 00:23:34.891
don't become a comedian.

558
00:23:34.935 --> 00:23:36.327
The worst thing in the world
would be a comedian

559
00:23:36.371 --> 00:23:38.112
to open up for someone

560
00:23:38.155 --> 00:23:40.070
who just died that the audience
doesn't know it yet.

561
00:23:41.376 --> 00:23:43.160
[chuckles] Well. let's say
I open up for Ricky Nelson.

sucked it at a club.

567
00:23:54.781 --> 00:23:57.697
So it wasn't even. like. "Well.
at least I had a good set."

Stunk. No money. Yeah.

have to be with trials?

I meant to frame the $20.

that they were that attentive
to the parking laws.

599
00:25:16.906 --> 00:25:18.560
so I wound up racking up...

600
00:25:18.604 --> 00:25:20.431
I think I got
five parking tickets that day.

Zanies was started by
three partners in 1978.

00:25:28.091 --> 00:25:31.007
one of whom was
a cousin of Rick Uchwat.

605
00:25:31.051 --> 00:25:34.837
and Rick owns this building.
or he did prior to his passing.

606
00:25:34.881 --> 00:25:36.578
So they had a great idea.

607
00:25:36.622 --> 00:25:38.145
but they didn't know
how to execute it.

608
00:25:38.188 --> 00:25:39.886
So the club was
going out of business.

609
00:25:39.929 --> 00:25:43.933
So Rick took over in 1980.
and then that was really

610
00:25:43.977 --> 00:25:45.718
the beginning of
the history of Zanies.

"Was that line that offensive?"

Working Zanies was.
like. a huge goal of mine.

628
00:26:27.324 --> 00:26:30.806

and do the open mic
at the Lions' Den."

841
00:34:38.163 --> 00:34:39.599
[Pete] Yup.

842
00:34:39.642 --> 00:34:41.340
[TJ] And so
I was working on the--

843
00:34:41.383 --> 00:34:42.819
I had written so much material.
Some of it's like.

844
00:34:42.863 --> 00:34:44.865
"What if advertisements
could cuss?"

845
00:34:44.908 --> 00:34:47.476
Right?
What if they could curse. huh?

846
00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.739
"Snickers.
Now that's fuckin' satisfying!"

847
00:34:49.783 --> 00:34:53.134
Ohh!
The three-point line. brick.

848
00:34:53.613 --> 00:34:56.094
So I had gotten
all this material together.

849
00:34:56.137 --> 00:34:58.792
Memorial Day came.
and so I called and said.

850
00:34:58.835 --> 00:35:01.142
"Hey. you know.
I-- I would love to know.

851
00:35:01.186 --> 00:35:02.883
like. when is the sign-up?"

852
00:35:02.926 --> 00:35:04.580
And the guy there said.

853
00:35:04.624 --> 00:35:06.060
"Oh. we're not having
the open mic tonight."

854
00:35:06.104 --> 00:35:07.757
-[Pete] No?
-[TJ] So I thought.

855
00:35:07.801 --> 00:35:09.107
"What the fuck
am I supposed to do?"

856
00:35:09.629 --> 00:35:12.327
You know. I-- I told myself
this was the day

857
00:35:12.371 --> 00:35:13.894
I was gonna do my first set.

858
00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:16.679
So I quickly looked up
all the other open mics

859
00:35:16.723 --> 00:35:19.117
in the Chicago Reader.
and I found one.

860
00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.596
It was called the Cotton Club.

861
00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:21.989
All you do is
get on the Red Line

862
00:35:22.032 --> 00:35:23.643
and go all the way south.

863
00:35:26.298 --> 00:35:28.909
So I get off the Red Line.
and I start walking.

864
00:35:31.433 --> 00:35:33.479
And I'm like. "Wow. this is--

865
00:35:33.522 --> 00:35:35.785
a lot of dilapidated
buildings here."

866
00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:39.006
And then I find myself
coming upon the Cotton Club.

867
00:35:39.049 --> 00:35:41.443
which had a red carpet
that went out front.

868
00:35:41.487 --> 00:35:43.228
It looked amazing. I walk in.
and there's no one there.

869
00:35:43.271 --> 00:35:44.925
It's Memorial Day.

870
00:35:44.968 --> 00:35:46.666
So I was like.
this will be a funny story.

871
00:35:46.709 --> 00:35:49.234
My first open mic.
I bomb in front of the bartender

872
00:35:49.277 --> 00:35:51.497
and three other people.
you know?

873
00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:53.412
'Cause I was the only
white person in the room.

874
00:35:53.455 --> 00:35:55.153
All right.
going to the bathroom.

875
00:35:55.196 --> 00:35:56.806
where I start running
my set over and over.

876
00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:59.026
as we are want to do
in the beginning.

877
00:35:59.069 --> 00:36:00.854
Finally go. "Okay. I'm ready."

878
00:36:00.897 --> 00:36:03.900
And I walk outside. and
the place was fucking packed.

879
00:36:03.944 --> 00:36:07.861
It was full to the-- There must
have been 400 people there.

880
00:36:07.904 --> 00:36:09.950
-Shut up.
-I am still the only

881
00:36:09.993 --> 00:36:11.821
-white person in the room.
-Oh. shit.

882
00:36:11.865 --> 00:36:15.042
Now. the Cotton Club was
a room full of gangsters

883
00:36:15.085 --> 00:36:17.131
and dope dealers.
I'ma be honest with you.

884
00:36:17.175 --> 00:36:20.743
You had pimps.
you had drug dealers.

885
00:36:20.787 --> 00:36:22.745
It was like New Jack City.

886
00:36:22.789 --> 00:36:25.879
It comes my time
to get up on stage.

887
00:36:25.922 --> 00:36:28.316
And. uh. Big Sugar.

888
00:36:28.882 --> 00:36:30.579
-was who was the--
-Suge?

889
00:36:30.623 --> 00:36:32.581
-Not Big Suge.
-Suge Knight's niece.

890
00:36:32.625 --> 00:36:34.975
Yes. Suge Knight's niece.
Big Sugare.

891
00:36:35.584 --> 00:36:37.325
-It's Big Suga.
-Uh-huh.

892
00:36:37.369 --> 00:36:39.719
And. uh. so he was so nice.
'cause I went up to him.

893
00:36:39.762 --> 00:36:41.634
and I said. "Look.
I've never done stand-up before.

894
00:36:41.677 --> 00:36:43.549
and do you think
I should not go up?"

895
00:36:43.592 --> 00:36:46.639
Basically implying. like.
"Hey. I'm a young white guy

896
00:36:46.682 --> 00:36:49.207
who's never done stand-up.
Please. Is this a good idea?"

897
00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:51.600
And he's like. "Yeah. Trust me.
I'll-- I'll make sure you.

898
00:36:51.644 --> 00:36:53.211
you know. you feel welcome."

899
00:36:53.254 --> 00:36:55.691
He gets on stage. and he goes.

900
00:36:55.735 --> 00:36:57.824
"I wanna hear a big.
big round of applause.

901
00:36:57.867 --> 00:36:59.347
Come on. give him some love.

902
00:36:59.391 --> 00:37:00.827
This is his first time
on stage ever.

903
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:03.264
Please.
ladies and gentlemen. TJ Miller.

904
00:37:03.308 --> 00:37:06.006
Come on! Come on! Come on!"
Really got 'em going.

905
00:37:06.485 --> 00:37:08.138
It was amazing.
and I got on stage.

906
00:37:08.182 --> 00:37:09.966
and it felt like
this crazy thing.

907
00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:11.707
the lights. everything.

908
00:37:11.751 --> 00:37:13.579
And I grabbed the mic...

909
00:37:13.622 --> 00:37:16.625
You had to really. really
be able to make them laugh

910
00:37:16.669 --> 00:37:19.628
to get any kind of
traction at that room.

911
00:37:20.194 --> 00:37:23.328
"Hey. uh. thank you guys all for
comin' out to see me tonight.

912
00:37:23.371 --> 00:37:26.200
I. uh--"
Huge. explosive laughter.

913
00:37:26.809 --> 00:37:29.725
Because no one had
come to see me tonight.

914
00:37:29.769 --> 00:37:31.031
But you didn't mean it
as a joke.

915
00:37:31.074 --> 00:37:32.641
-Not at all.
-Ah.

916
00:37:32.685 --> 00:37:34.295
But a huge laugh.
In my mind. I'm like.

917
00:37:34.339 --> 00:37:36.297
"I'm a natural stand-up.
I mean. this is it.

918
00:37:36.341 --> 00:37:38.821
It's that easy! Let's do it!"

919
00:37:38.865 --> 00:37:42.477
And so. my entire upbringings.

920
00:37:42.521 --> 00:37:44.174
like. the beginnings
of my stand-up career.

921
00:37:44.218 --> 00:37:45.306
were all on the South Side.

922
00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:48.875
♪

923
00:37:48.918 --> 00:37:50.703
[Erica Nicole Clark]
I grew up in Lake Forest.

924
00:37:50.746 --> 00:37:52.444
I grew up making white people
laugh with the shit

925
00:37:52.487 --> 00:37:56.099
that my nigger parents
were saying to me.

926
00:37:56.143 --> 00:37:58.754
And I'm not saying Black.
I'm saying they straight niggas

927
00:37:58.798 --> 00:38:00.713
from fuckin' 63rd
and County Met.

928
00:38:00.756 --> 00:38:03.106
Like. in my head.
I always thought that. like.

929
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:06.022
you can make white people laugh

930
00:38:06.066 --> 00:38:08.677
by just being yourself.
for being Black.

931
00:38:08.721 --> 00:38:12.464
I think Black people...
I-- I can't explain it.

932
00:38:12.507 --> 00:38:15.423
It's just. like.
my friends thought I was funny

933
00:38:15.467 --> 00:38:17.773
'cause I would repeat the stuff
that my mom said to them.

934
00:38:17.817 --> 00:38:19.645
You know? And. um...

935
00:38:19.688 --> 00:38:22.256
but it's like. can I repeat
the stuff my mom said

936
00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.127
to my Black friends and
still get that same reaction

937
00:38:24.171 --> 00:38:25.346
and still think they funny?

938
00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:27.696
Um. not all the time. not 100%.

939
00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:29.394
I think there's
different struggles in.

940
00:38:29.437 --> 00:38:31.657
uh. on both sides.
but funny is funny. and I--

941
00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:33.136
I've seen people who were funny

942
00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:35.443
go to both sides
and do their job.

943
00:38:35.487 --> 00:38:37.837
There are people who like
to say. "Funny is funny."

944
00:38:39.012 --> 00:38:40.753
That's bullshit. [chuckles]

945
00:38:40.796 --> 00:38:42.363
Funny is not funny.

946
00:38:42.407 --> 00:38:44.234
Funny is funny
depending who's listening.

947
00:38:44.278 --> 00:38:47.368
Right? You can't say
"Music is music." Right?

948
00:38:47.412 --> 00:38:49.457
If I'm a fuckin' classical
music lover and I walk into

949
00:38:49.501 --> 00:38:51.503
a rock and roll club. I'd go.
"What is this bullshit?"

950
00:38:51.546 --> 00:38:54.332
It's not what I was expecting
to hear. It's not what I like.

951
00:38:54.375 --> 00:38:57.247
And I don't see why comedians

952
00:38:57.291 --> 00:39:00.773
get pressured into
this space of. uh.

953
00:39:00.816 --> 00:39:04.167
we are supposed to be able
to appeal to everyone.

954
00:39:04.211 --> 00:39:05.908
We do not.

955
00:39:05.952 --> 00:39:08.258
That's just not
the fuckin' truth.

956
00:39:09.521 --> 00:39:12.524
One night-- and this is
before anybody was anybody.

957
00:39:12.567 --> 00:39:15.788
so. you know. I mean. this is
all in retrospect now. but--

958
00:39:15.831 --> 00:39:19.705
Bernie Mac came out
to the Comedy Cottage.

959
00:39:19.748 --> 00:39:21.402
And to his credit.

960
00:39:21.446 --> 00:39:23.926
'cause he's tryin' to do
and play other places.

961
00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:25.058
And...

962
00:39:25.841 --> 00:39:27.408
he didn't do well.

963
00:39:27.452 --> 00:39:28.975
I mean. they didn't
really laugh. you know?

964
00:39:29.018 --> 00:39:30.890
But again.
it's just people's diff--

965
00:39:30.933 --> 00:39:32.587
Just different sensibilities.

966
00:39:32.631 --> 00:39:34.589
and that's not an indictment
on your talent.

967
00:39:34.633 --> 00:39:36.591
It's just
different sensibilities.

968
00:39:36.635 --> 00:39:39.202
You know. there were a few local
guys who could play both rooms

969
00:39:39.246 --> 00:39:41.770
and not feel like
you were being disingenuous

970
00:39:41.814 --> 00:39:43.990
when you were in
one or the other.

971
00:39:44.033 --> 00:39:45.731
You have no idea
why they call you Spike.

972
00:39:45.774 --> 00:39:47.428
[audience member] No idea.

973
00:39:47.472 --> 00:39:48.995
It has never entered
your mind to ask them

974
00:39:49.038 --> 00:39:50.649
-why they call you that?
-[audience laughs]

975
00:39:52.259 --> 00:39:53.782
Like. if someone
called me Spike. I go.

976
00:39:53.826 --> 00:39:55.001
"Why'd you call me that?"

977
00:39:56.655 --> 00:39:58.352
I just wouldn't let it go. So
if I called you a motherfucker.

978
00:39:58.396 --> 00:40:00.920
-you'd say. "Well. yes."
-[audience laughs]

979
00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:03.966
The first person
I saw was Orlando Reyes.

980
00:40:04.445 --> 00:40:05.968
I was 16 years old.

981
00:40:06.012 --> 00:40:08.144
and his act was pretty.
you know. risqué.

982
00:40:08.188 --> 00:40:10.625
Came from the all-girls
Catholic boarding school

983
00:40:10.669 --> 00:40:13.585
and met Orlando. and it was
a whole new experience for me.

984
00:40:13.628 --> 00:40:16.414
I hadn't heard a lot
of the words before.

985
00:40:16.457 --> 00:40:18.807
and he was always very helpful

986
00:40:18.851 --> 00:40:21.114
in describing
what he had meant to say.

987
00:40:21.157 --> 00:40:23.769
"You ever look at. uh. your girl
while she's suckin' your dick?

988
00:40:24.639 --> 00:40:26.119
Her eyes be lookin' at you

989
00:40:26.162 --> 00:40:27.425
like a crocodile
lookin' over a swamp."

990
00:40:28.164 --> 00:40:31.211
"Why don't Polish people
use paper plates?

991
00:40:31.254 --> 00:40:32.821
'Cause it fucks up
the dishwasher."

992
00:40:33.256 --> 00:40:36.956
He used to love to
introduce me as "Jeff Jizz."

993
00:40:37.435 --> 00:40:39.785
"Jeff Jizz. everybody!
Jeff Jizz."

994
00:40:39.828 --> 00:40:42.701
He had this. uh.
interesting way of dressing.

995
00:40:42.744 --> 00:40:44.442
Orlando looked like a pimp.

996
00:40:44.485 --> 00:40:46.705
Velvet jackets and have
the cigarette on stage.

997
00:40:46.748 --> 00:40:48.489
and he'd be like.
"Has anybody got a cigarette?

998
00:40:48.533 --> 00:40:50.012
I left mine in the machine."

999
00:40:50.622 --> 00:40:53.146
In terms of the history
of Chicago comedy.

1000
00:40:53.189 --> 00:40:55.453
the era that
we're talking about.

1001
00:40:55.496 --> 00:41:00.806
you're not legit unless you did
the Stay Out with Orlando.

1002
00:41:03.504 --> 00:41:06.812
That made-- that makes you.
like. the real deal.

1003
00:41:06.855 --> 00:41:09.902
to do the Stay Out All Night
Disco with Orlando.

1004
00:41:09.945 --> 00:41:11.773
Oh. God. yes!

1005
00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:16.343
He was dirty at Zanies.

1006
00:41:16.996 --> 00:41:19.215
You put him at four o'clock
in the morning

1007
00:41:19.259 --> 00:41:21.609
at a disco near the airport?

1008
00:41:21.653 --> 00:41:24.264
Oh. my God! Oh. my God!

1009
00:41:24.307 --> 00:41:26.309
"By applause.
who likes to butt fuck?"

1010
00:41:26.353 --> 00:41:28.486
[laughing]

1011
00:41:29.443 --> 00:41:30.749
Yes.

1012
00:41:30.792 --> 00:41:32.794
[laughing]

1013
00:41:33.621 --> 00:41:35.405
[exhales]

1014
00:41:35.449 --> 00:41:37.233
He actually said that!

1015
00:41:37.277 --> 00:41:38.844
You were out at Sunday night
drinking at 4:00 a.m..

1016
00:41:38.887 --> 00:41:40.802
you're an alcoholic.

1017
00:41:40.846 --> 00:41:42.804
So it's bunch of alcoholics
at a place that looks like--

1018
00:41:42.848 --> 00:41:45.241
looks like you walked off
the set of Saturday Night Fever.

1019
00:41:46.634 --> 00:41:48.418
It was kind of
a strip joint. uh.

1020
00:41:48.462 --> 00:41:50.943
and really. really
a bucket of blood.

1021
00:41:50.986 --> 00:41:53.206
I mean. the-- the men's rooms.

1022
00:41:53.249 --> 00:41:56.514
um. were plastered--
Every available surface

1023
00:41:56.557 --> 00:41:59.038
was a lacquered
female body part.

1024
00:41:59.081 --> 00:42:00.779
Um. you know.
pictures. cut-outs.

1025
00:42:00.822 --> 00:42:02.563
Some guy had cut out
Playboy magazines

1026
00:42:02.607 --> 00:42:04.173
and cut out Penthouse

1027
00:42:04.217 --> 00:42:07.046
and just put vaginas
and breasts everywhere.

1028
00:42:07.089 --> 00:42:10.484
and. uh. and you peed
into a urinal that was.

1029
00:42:10.528 --> 00:42:13.531
you know. also lacquered
with female body parts.

1030
00:42:13.574 --> 00:42:15.271
I-- I-- I don't know
what was going on.

1031
00:42:15.315 --> 00:42:16.882
But you could get
killed there pretty easily.

1032
00:42:16.925 --> 00:42:19.362
That was a gig
that I did for the money.

1033
00:42:19.406 --> 00:42:20.668
Fifty bucks.

1034
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:24.193
That was a big--
That's big money back then.

1035
00:42:26.631 --> 00:42:30.243
Orlando. I believe.
was shot on stage.

1036
00:42:30.286 --> 00:42:32.419
Now. I'm not sure
they were shooting at him.

1037
00:42:32.462 --> 00:42:34.639
People in the audience
had some sort of a disagreement.

1038
00:42:34.682 --> 00:42:36.728
I guess it would be
an armed disagreement.

1039
00:42:36.771 --> 00:42:39.513
and. um.
he took a bullet somehow.

1040
00:42:39.557 --> 00:42:41.036
He was not killed. he was-- I--

1041
00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:42.951
I don't think
he was injured badly.

1042
00:42:42.995 --> 00:42:47.216
But Orlando was an amazing guy.
and he would do jokes.

1043
00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:48.348
He would do...

1044
00:42:48.957 --> 00:42:51.481
terribly racist jokes
that I can't say.

1045
00:42:51.525 --> 00:42:55.007
He was as funny off stage
as he was on stage.

1046
00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:57.096
One time
he came over to my house

1047
00:42:57.139 --> 00:42:59.228
and played Santa Claus
on Christmas Eve.

1048
00:42:59.272 --> 00:43:01.317
You know. they never
saw a Black Santa Claus.

1049
00:43:01.361 --> 00:43:03.102
Orlando was Black.

1050
00:43:03.145 --> 00:43:04.799
And. uh. you know.
they-- they were just amazed.

1051
00:43:04.843 --> 00:43:06.409
They were amazed.

1052
00:43:06.453 --> 00:43:08.498
Orlando booked me
at a women's prison.

1053
00:43:08.542 --> 00:43:10.370
and Orlando goes up.
and he does this--

1054
00:43:10.413 --> 00:43:12.981
Orlando. and they love him
'cause he's filthy.

1055
00:43:13.025 --> 00:43:15.027
and he's great.
and he's got this presence.

1056
00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:17.986
and he introduces me.
this 16-year-old little kid

1057
00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:20.423
who goes up in front
of these really hard women.

1058
00:43:20.467 --> 00:43:22.948
and I-- The first few jokes.
they were not going for me.

1059
00:43:22.991 --> 00:43:24.950
And then about
the third joke or so.

1060
00:43:24.993 --> 00:43:27.039
they finally gave it up. and
they-- And I had a good show.

1061
00:43:27.082 --> 00:43:29.302
and I remember
standing there with my dad

1062
00:43:29.345 --> 00:43:31.304
as they were filing out
to go back to their cells.

1063
00:43:31.347 --> 00:43:32.914
and my dad was laughing
'cause they were all like.

1064
00:43:32.958 --> 00:43:34.437
"Why don't you come back
to my cell with me.

1065
00:43:34.481 --> 00:43:35.613
I'll show you a good time!"

1066
00:43:37.484 --> 00:43:39.660
Lust knows no color. okay?

1067
00:43:39.704 --> 00:43:41.619
-[audience laughter]
-She can be purple.

1068
00:43:41.662 --> 00:43:43.882
When a man sees a woman.
we thinkin' one thought.

1069
00:43:43.925 --> 00:43:46.145
-We're like. "Damn!"
-[audience laughs]

1070
00:43:46.188 --> 00:43:49.365
-I'll hit that.
-[audience laughs]

1071
00:43:50.323 --> 00:43:51.977
"Never had purple before."

1072
00:43:53.718 --> 00:43:56.590
Black. white. blue.
I don't care who.

1073
00:43:56.634 --> 00:43:58.331
Had a comedy club.
there was nothing better

1074
00:43:58.374 --> 00:44:00.159
than All Jokes Aside
when it was at its height.

1075
00:44:00.202 --> 00:44:02.857
[Mary] It was gonna be
different from the white clubs.

1076
00:44:02.901 --> 00:44:05.425
only because. one.
they're Black comics

1077
00:44:05.468 --> 00:44:07.775
and the content
would be different.

1078
00:44:07.819 --> 00:44:11.605
and we're selling to
a predominantly Black audience.

1079
00:44:11.649 --> 00:44:13.520
All Jokes Aside was a big deal.

1080
00:44:13.563 --> 00:44:18.394
Was the premier Black comedy
club in the United States.

1081
00:44:18.438 --> 00:44:21.136
All the big Black
comedians came there.

1082
00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:24.270
Like Jamie Foxx.
Mark Curry. DL Hughley.

1083
00:44:24.313 --> 00:44:26.054
Dave Chappelle. Chris Rock.

1084
00:44:26.098 --> 00:44:27.839
Cedric the Entertainer.
and. you know. and Steve Harvey.

1085
00:44:27.882 --> 00:44:29.667
and of course
Bernie was a mainstay there.

1086
00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:33.018
I just thought that
that was our Black comedy club.

1087
00:44:33.061 --> 00:44:35.847
I didn't know we weren't
the only Black comedy club.

1088
00:44:35.890 --> 00:44:38.763
It was run so professionally.
and-- and it was. uh--

1089
00:44:38.806 --> 00:44:41.766
it was during the boom.
uh. for Black comedy.

1090
00:44:41.809 --> 00:44:44.029
Uh. Raymond Lambert
and Mary Lindsey

1091
00:44:44.072 --> 00:44:46.161
came from the business world.
and they ran that club

1092
00:44:46.205 --> 00:44:48.033
more so like a business
than a club.

1093
00:44:48.076 --> 00:44:49.991
The whole staff wore uniforms.

1094
00:44:50.035 --> 00:44:53.778
and they had to treat us
with a certain level of respect.

1095
00:44:53.821 --> 00:44:55.649
That's why all of us.
we had to treat the club

1096
00:44:55.693 --> 00:44:58.608
with a lot more respect.
We had to dress a certain way.

1097
00:44:58.652 --> 00:45:00.785
And I-- I did the same thing
with the audience.

1098
00:45:00.828 --> 00:45:04.049
You can't match
a hoodie with a jacket.

1099
00:45:04.092 --> 00:45:06.442
This is an old-school thing
my parents used to do.

1100
00:45:06.486 --> 00:45:09.097
You-- you usually don't get in
fights when you're dressed up.

1101
00:45:09.141 --> 00:45:11.665
Like. you-- you--
There's a certain behavior

1102
00:45:11.709 --> 00:45:13.493
that you have
when you look nice.

1103
00:45:13.536 --> 00:45:16.714
You're like. "I really
don't wanna get into an argument

1104
00:45:16.757 --> 00:45:18.193
when I'm dressed up like that."

1105
00:45:18.237 --> 00:45:21.457
There's a tight ship
that was ran.

1106
00:45:21.501 --> 00:45:23.938
We were there for eight years
and never had one incident.

1107
00:45:23.982 --> 00:45:27.681
which is unheard of
for a club or a bar

1108
00:45:27.725 --> 00:45:30.075
with a liquor license.
never to have any incidents.

1109
00:45:30.118 --> 00:45:31.772
but we were
very diligent about that.

1110
00:45:31.816 --> 00:45:34.122
I didn't realize at the time.
I probably was--

1111
00:45:34.166 --> 00:45:38.605
I was doin' myself a disservice
by not playin' more Black rooms.

1112
00:45:38.648 --> 00:45:41.434
because that was a whole
segment of-- of audience

1113
00:45:41.477 --> 00:45:42.827
that I was missing.

1114
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:44.698
I want everybody
to laugh at this.

1115
00:45:44.742 --> 00:45:46.787
because I always thought
that more people that laughed.

1116
00:45:46.831 --> 00:45:50.660
the more people than I can
perform in front of. and...

1117
00:45:51.661 --> 00:45:53.446
if they get my audience bigger.

1118
00:45:53.489 --> 00:45:55.448
the more money
I could probably make.

1119
00:45:55.491 --> 00:45:58.320
As some people say.
the South Side makes you funny.

1120
00:45:58.364 --> 00:46:00.192
the North Side makes you money.

1121
00:46:00.235 --> 00:46:01.976
And-- and don't get me wrong.
I wasn't even thinkin'

1122
00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:04.544
about money in the end.
I'm just thinkin' about audience

1123
00:46:04.587 --> 00:46:08.069
at the time. I just wanted
my audience to be diverse.

1124
00:46:08.113 --> 00:46:10.811
[Godfrey] I started doin'
comedy at the Fallout. and then

1125
00:46:10.855 --> 00:46:14.510
from there. I said. okay.
I wanna go to the South Side

1126
00:46:14.554 --> 00:46:17.078
and perform. I wanna do
Black rooms too. you know.

1127
00:46:17.122 --> 00:46:18.558
I wanted to go both ways.

1128
00:46:18.601 --> 00:46:20.603
My ideal crowd
was a mixed crowd.

1129
00:46:20.647 --> 00:46:22.388
Black folks and white folks.

1130
00:46:22.431 --> 00:46:24.042
and older folks
and younger folks.

1131
00:46:24.085 --> 00:46:26.000
You know. I liked that.
because then people's--

1132
00:46:26.044 --> 00:46:29.177
people's. uh. sensibilities sort
of interact with each other.

1133
00:46:29.221 --> 00:46:31.136
So if somebody's
not gettin' a joke.

1134
00:46:31.179 --> 00:46:32.877
then somebody else
might get the joke.

1135
00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:34.704
and-- and it. and-- and
it just creates laughter.

1136
00:46:34.748 --> 00:46:35.967
almost everybody.

1137
00:46:38.621 --> 00:46:41.059
The only way you gon'
learn as a comedian

1138
00:46:41.102 --> 00:46:44.366
to make everybody
in the country laugh.

1139
00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:45.890
you have to travel the road.

1140
00:46:45.933 --> 00:46:52.157
♪

1141
00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:55.638
Because what's funny in Chicago

1142
00:46:55.682 --> 00:46:57.684
might not be funny in New York.

1143
00:46:57.727 --> 00:47:00.078
might not be funny in Miami.

1144
00:47:00.121 --> 00:47:01.906
might not be
funny in California.

1145
00:47:03.385 --> 00:47:05.866
I had never really done well

1146
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:07.781
at the-- the Melrose improv.

1147
00:47:07.825 --> 00:47:10.044
And. finally.
you know. it was like

1148
00:47:10.088 --> 00:47:13.004
my fourth or fifth set.
I had a really good set.

1149
00:47:13.047 --> 00:47:14.788
and Budd Friedman
was in the audience.

1150
00:47:14.832 --> 00:47:16.529
And I remember
somebody else was emceeing.

1151
00:47:16.572 --> 00:47:19.532
but Budd came up
to take me off stage.

1152
00:47:19.575 --> 00:47:22.187
and he said to the audience.
"Very funny man.

1153
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:24.537
Mr. Paul Gilmartin.
Look for him.

1154
00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:27.192
He will be on
Evening at the Improv."

1155
00:47:27.235 --> 00:47:30.325
And I was like. "Yeah.
I'm-- I'm fuckin' in now.

1156
00:47:30.369 --> 00:47:32.197
I'm in with the Improv!

1157
00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:35.156
And. uh. I'm gonna start
hangin' around here now!

1158
00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:37.071
'Cause I won't feel
like an outsider."

1159
00:47:37.115 --> 00:47:39.291
And so the next night.
I come in to the Improv.

1160
00:47:39.334 --> 00:47:41.119
and I'm standing
in the hallways.

1161
00:47:41.162 --> 00:47:43.904
People are kind of
filing in and filing out.

1162
00:47:43.948 --> 00:47:45.819
And he comes up to me
and he goes.

1163
00:47:45.863 --> 00:47:47.647
"Sir? Do you have a ticket?"

1164
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:51.390
That is show business.

1165
00:47:52.173 --> 00:47:54.523
That is show business.

1166
00:47:56.264 --> 00:47:59.006
All these comedy clubs
started tryin' to save money.

1167
00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:02.053
They were spending so much money
on hotel rooms for comedians.

1168
00:48:02.096 --> 00:48:04.272
what they start doing
is buying condos.

1169
00:48:04.316 --> 00:48:09.974
So you would go check in there
and find leftover stuff from

1170
00:48:11.105 --> 00:48:14.413
the whole month of comedians
leaving condoms

1171
00:48:14.456 --> 00:48:17.459
and coke all on the countertop.

1172
00:48:17.503 --> 00:48:20.854
I think my worst comedy condo
experience is Painesville. Ohio.

1173
00:48:20.898 --> 00:48:23.683
And I'm guessing I'm not the
first person to tell you that.

1174
00:48:23.726 --> 00:48:28.644
Uh. you stayed at somebody's
house behind the comedy club.

1175
00:48:28.688 --> 00:48:31.952
and the shower-- You were not
allowed to use the shower!

1176
00:48:31.996 --> 00:48:34.346
Do not use the shower!
You can use the bathtub.

1177
00:48:34.955 --> 00:48:36.565
And the bathtub was. like.

1178
00:48:36.609 --> 00:48:38.524
in the middle of the kitchen
or something.

1179
00:48:38.567 --> 00:48:40.439
so you had to go-- you had to
walk downstairs awkwardly.

1180
00:48:40.482 --> 00:48:43.268
and then get
in this old-fashioned tub

1181
00:48:43.311 --> 00:48:45.052
with feet on it

1182
00:48:45.096 --> 00:48:47.141
and splash around
to get clean to go do comedy.

1183
00:48:47.185 --> 00:48:50.101
and. uh. you know. I don't--
you know. I'm not four.

1184
00:48:50.144 --> 00:48:51.232
Why am I takin' a bath?

1185
00:48:51.885 --> 00:48:53.452
The door was off the hinge.

1186
00:48:53.495 --> 00:48:56.150
Blood was on the sofa.

1187
00:48:56.194 --> 00:48:57.978
That's when I said.

1188
00:48:58.022 --> 00:49:01.503
"I can't stay here.
I can't stay here."

1189
00:49:01.547 --> 00:49:03.592
Tony. you wrote
the funniest thing on that wall!

1190
00:49:04.289 --> 00:49:06.813
"Great club. great staff.
and a place to sleep."

1191
00:49:08.119 --> 00:49:10.860
The one that was horrible.

1192
00:49:10.904 --> 00:49:12.993
but I didn't consider it
horrible at the time.

1193
00:49:13.037 --> 00:49:15.996
was Comedy Café. Milwaukee.

1194
00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:18.781
because I was living
with my parents at the time

1195
00:49:18.825 --> 00:49:21.001
when I first started
working there. so it was just--

1196
00:49:21.045 --> 00:49:24.004
in my mind. I'm like.
"This is mine. I got my place.

1197
00:49:24.048 --> 00:49:27.965
I'm doin' comedy.
I'm makin' $200 this weekend.

1198
00:49:28.008 --> 00:49:29.531
and I got this place.

1199
00:49:29.575 --> 00:49:31.185
One that I can fuck in."

1200
00:49:31.229 --> 00:49:32.708
And I--
and I never fucked there.

1201
00:49:32.752 --> 00:49:35.537
But it could have happened!

1202
00:49:36.799 --> 00:49:39.411
Jeff Garlin and I
were doing a one-nighter

1203
00:49:39.454 --> 00:49:41.543
in Lafayette. Indiana.

1204
00:49:41.587 --> 00:49:44.024
and it was in a restaurant.

1205
00:49:44.068 --> 00:49:46.026
and it was just one of those
gigs when you walked in.

1206
00:49:46.070 --> 00:49:47.985
you're-- you could
just feel your stomach sink.

1207
00:49:48.028 --> 00:49:50.335
You just--
Everything was set up wrong.

1208
00:49:50.378 --> 00:49:52.076
It-- The lighting was terrible.

1209
00:49:52.119 --> 00:49:54.208
the sound system was bad.
people were eating.

1210
00:49:54.252 --> 00:49:56.210
All the-- all the distractions.
that. you know.

1211
00:49:56.254 --> 00:49:59.126
that-- that can really hurt
a comedy-- comedy show.

1212
00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:02.434
And. um. and so.
they gave you dinner

1213
00:50:02.477 --> 00:50:05.480
before the show. and--
and we're sitting there eating.

1214
00:50:05.524 --> 00:50:07.221
and we can see
there's only. like. 12 people.

1215
00:50:07.265 --> 00:50:09.658
and they're drunk.
and they don't look very bright.

1216
00:50:10.398 --> 00:50:12.052
And so. um.

1217
00:50:12.096 --> 00:50:14.576
I can't remember who said it.

1218
00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:16.491
but I think I dared Jeff.

1219
00:50:16.535 --> 00:50:19.146
He was-- he was. uh.
eating a piece of cake.

1220
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:22.976
and I dared him to go up.
uh. with cake on his face.

1221
00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:24.630
And we both kind of
laughed about it.

1222
00:50:24.673 --> 00:50:26.632
And so I went up
and I struggled. you know.

1223
00:50:26.675 --> 00:50:29.243
ate it for-- I was probably
supposed to do a half hour.

1224
00:50:29.287 --> 00:50:31.115
probably did about 15 minutes.

1225
00:50:31.158 --> 00:50:34.509
and came off stage.
and I think--

1226
00:50:34.553 --> 00:50:36.772
I think Jeff thought. "Oh.

1227
00:50:36.816 --> 00:50:38.774
you know. Paul just doesn't know
how to handle them. you know."

1228
00:50:38.818 --> 00:50:42.517
So he goes up there. and he's--
he's trying everything.

1229
00:50:42.561 --> 00:50:44.693
And you can see. it's--
He's getting frustrated.

1230
00:50:44.737 --> 00:50:46.260
and it's just not working.

1231
00:50:46.304 --> 00:50:47.914
I had been eating it. I died.

1232
00:50:47.957 --> 00:50:49.655
And at a certain point.

1233
00:50:49.698 --> 00:50:51.700
he just-- he knew
it wasn't gonna get any better.

1234
00:50:51.744 --> 00:50:54.442
And I remember the look in
his face. and he just stopped.

1235
00:50:54.486 --> 00:50:57.228
I took the cake.
and I wiped it all over my face.

1236
00:50:57.271 --> 00:50:59.099
and my face
has cake all over it.

1237
00:50:59.143 --> 00:51:01.710
and I said to the audience.
like. oh. "Hi. I'm Cakey!"

1238
00:51:01.754 --> 00:51:03.495
He finished his act.

1239
00:51:03.538 --> 00:51:05.932
And so when you would
go and bomb on the road

1240
00:51:05.975 --> 00:51:07.760
and come back and be like.
"It was so hard."

1241
00:51:07.803 --> 00:51:09.675
people would be like.
"Don't worry about that. I mean.

1242
00:51:09.718 --> 00:51:11.198
-show at the Lion's Den."
-At least you knew you could

1243
00:51:11.242 --> 00:51:12.895
come to the Lion's Den
and tell them

1244
00:51:12.939 --> 00:51:14.462
that you ate your dick
in South Bend. Indiana.

1245
00:51:16.682 --> 00:51:20.164
I'm well aware that
it's like a white boys' club.

1246
00:51:20.207 --> 00:51:22.079
and I'm probably a member of it

1247
00:51:22.122 --> 00:51:24.124
because I have
this famous father.

1248
00:51:24.168 --> 00:51:27.736
For some reason.
it carries weight with certain--

1249
00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:30.174
I don't know. they think
he's gonna come to the show?

1250
00:51:30.217 --> 00:51:32.567
Or I'ma pass out gold chains

1251
00:51:32.611 --> 00:51:34.569
while I'm on the stage
or some shit?

1252
00:51:34.613 --> 00:51:36.136
I don't know
what the fuck they think.

1253
00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:39.531
but they always give me.
like. more leeway.

1254
00:51:39.574 --> 00:51:44.188
I think. because of that
than. um. other women.

1255
00:51:45.014 --> 00:51:46.929
That has to be it.

1256
00:51:46.973 --> 00:51:48.670
'Cause I don't think I'm any
better than anybody else. but...

1257
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:53.371
Diane Alaimo brought me along
to Wiley's in Dayton. Ohio.

1258
00:51:53.414 --> 00:51:55.068
We road-tripped.
and I learned a lot from her.

1259
00:51:55.112 --> 00:51:56.809
She's one of my favorites.
and I miss her a lot.

1260
00:51:56.852 --> 00:51:58.724
We lost her in. uh. 2001.

1261
00:51:58.767 --> 00:52:01.161
Diane went out of her way
to make sure

1262
00:52:01.205 --> 00:52:03.859
I got work at clubs that might
not otherwise hire women.

1263
00:52:03.903 --> 00:52:05.600
She brought me along
as a feature act.

1264
00:52:05.644 --> 00:52:07.950
and at the time--
and even now. a lot of clubs

1265
00:52:07.994 --> 00:52:09.996
won't book two women
on the same show.

1266
00:52:10.039 --> 00:52:13.173
and that wasn't a rule that she
thought needed to be enforced.

1267
00:52:13.217 --> 00:52:17.090
I came up with mostly men.
so sometimes people.

1268
00:52:17.134 --> 00:52:18.744
if they're
giving me a compliment.

1269
00:52:18.787 --> 00:52:20.702
they'll say.
"You do stand-up like a man."

1270
00:52:20.746 --> 00:52:22.443
And to me.
sometimes I take offense to that

1271
00:52:22.487 --> 00:52:25.054
'cause it's like. I do stand-up
like me and I'm a woman.

1272
00:52:25.098 --> 00:52:26.926
so I'm not doing it like a man.

1273
00:52:26.969 --> 00:52:28.145
You're just saying it
because you think it's funny.

1274
00:52:28.188 --> 00:52:29.624
then it is like a man.

1275
00:52:29.668 --> 00:52:31.104
There's a lot of funny women.

so difficult for women

is what goes on off-stage.

take for granted.

Huge red flag.

at me while I speak?

00:54:59.557 --> 00:55:02.168
And he kept on laughing.
and she would-- kept on saying.

1333
00:55:02.211 --> 00:55:04.301
"What's so funny?" And I--
You know. But remember.

1334
00:55:04.344 --> 00:55:06.955
I'm in my twenties. so.
I would do rude. stupid shit.

1335
00:55:06.999 --> 00:55:09.088
There was an element
of high school to it. I think.

1336
00:55:09.131 --> 00:55:12.309
We were young. We were. like.
20. you know. 24. whatever.

1337
00:55:15.964 --> 00:55:19.272
[Erica Nicole Clark] All right.
So this is the un-PC thing.

1338
00:55:19.316 --> 00:55:22.057
There are some very
perverted-ass fuckin' men

1339
00:55:22.101 --> 00:55:24.364
in the business.
and there's not a lot of women.

1340
00:55:24.408 --> 00:55:26.758
so there's perverted men and
they're taking advantage of it.

1341
00:55:26.801 --> 00:55:32.590
And I hate that women always
have to go for the victim card.

1342
00:55:32.633 --> 00:55:36.333
Like. if Louis CK pulled
his dick out in front of me...

1343
00:55:36.376 --> 00:55:40.380
I would be on tour with
Louis CK right now. [laughs]

1344
00:55:40.424 --> 00:55:43.383
I don't know. Like.
I feel like a lot of women

1345
00:55:43.427 --> 00:55:47.692
don't see the advantage
to a powerful man

1346
00:55:47.735 --> 00:55:49.824
doing something fucked up
in front of you.

1347
00:55:49.868 --> 00:55:52.174
And I'm not saying that--
that crosses the border.

1348
00:55:52.218 --> 00:55:54.263
that every time. oh.
a woman gets raped. she should--

1349
00:55:54.307 --> 00:55:57.005
You know. whatever.
I-- I'm not that crazy.

1350
00:55:57.049 --> 00:55:59.834
I'm just saying
in that particular instance.

1351
00:55:59.878 --> 00:56:03.882
I'm gonna be opening
at Carnegie Hall for Louis CK.

1352
00:56:05.362 --> 00:56:07.364
It wasn't easy.
It wasn't easy at all.

1353
00:56:07.407 --> 00:56:09.278
There were some guys
that were so loving to me.

1354
00:56:09.322 --> 00:56:11.368
They were like.
"Kara. get a therapist.

1355
00:56:11.411 --> 00:56:14.066
make sure it's a--
it's an unattractive woman.

1356
00:56:14.109 --> 00:56:16.982
You don't try to sleep with her.
Get a good therapist."

1357
00:56:17.025 --> 00:56:19.680
You know. and other guys just.
like. told me I was crazy.

1358
00:56:21.508 --> 00:56:23.380
[Sonal] I mean. I don't know
who's gonna see this.

1359
00:56:23.423 --> 00:56:25.556
All the comedy clubs are great.
everyone's super nice.

1360
00:56:25.599 --> 00:56:28.559
I love everyone
running all of the clubs.

1361
00:56:29.168 --> 00:56:32.432
Great dudes. all of you.
All the men. super nice.

1362
00:56:32.476 --> 00:56:35.566
You look right into my eyes when
you talk to me. I love that.

1363
00:56:35.609 --> 00:56:37.742
Probably if I had
any discrimination.

1364
00:56:37.785 --> 00:56:41.180
it was probably because I was
Black before I was a woman.

1365
00:56:41.223 --> 00:56:43.791
Um. which is. like.
two strikes against you.

1366
00:56:43.835 --> 00:56:46.446
[Chris] I think it's harder to--
for women and minorities

1367
00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:49.406
in life. so. it's--
it's gonna harder than any.

1368
00:56:49.449 --> 00:56:51.712
anything you ever get into.

1369
00:56:51.756 --> 00:56:54.498
So I think. uh. using that
and-- and powering through

1370
00:56:54.541 --> 00:56:56.804
those obstacles is-- is what
makes you a better comic.

1371
00:56:56.848 --> 00:57:01.766
♪

1372
00:57:04.116 --> 00:57:07.032
I have three TV shows. a movie.

1373
00:57:07.075 --> 00:57:09.338
I have specials.

1374
00:57:09.991 --> 00:57:11.993
And to this day.

1375
00:57:12.037 --> 00:57:14.474
Zanies would not book me.

1376
00:57:15.083 --> 00:57:17.172
To this day.

1377
00:57:17.216 --> 00:57:19.697
There's a certain type
of Black person

1378
00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:21.829
I think Zanies is looking for.

1379
00:57:21.873 --> 00:57:26.181
It's not me. [laughs] 'Cause
I've never performed at Zanies.

1380
00:57:26.225 --> 00:57:27.835
A lot of places
want a Black face

1381
00:57:27.879 --> 00:57:29.620
but they don't want
a Black voice.

1382
00:57:29.663 --> 00:57:31.186
Early on.
I was kind of upset by it.

1383
00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:32.797
I used to think
it was a problem.

1384
00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:34.625
Um. then I-- I kind of
cracked the thing.

1385
00:57:34.668 --> 00:57:36.453
because what happened?

1386
00:57:36.496 --> 00:57:38.716
I cracked the circuit.
'cause I just kept comin'.

1387
00:57:38.759 --> 00:57:40.413
And then they would hear.
economically. you know.

1388
00:57:40.457 --> 00:57:42.720
you can draw people out.
that's really the key.

1389
00:57:42.763 --> 00:57:44.678
And a lot of times when
I thought I was ready

1390
00:57:44.722 --> 00:57:46.245
to do Zanies. I wouldn't
have booked me either.

1391
00:57:46.288 --> 00:57:48.029
looking back at myself.
that guy.

1392
00:57:48.073 --> 00:57:49.857
[Bert Haas] Every club
has its own identity.

1393
00:57:49.901 --> 00:57:52.730
All Jokes Aside's identity
was urban comedy.

1394
00:57:52.773 --> 00:57:54.296
Which is really
code for "Black."

1395
00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:57.343
What happens is.
a good club books talent.

1396
00:57:57.386 --> 00:57:59.040
It's almost like a-- a riddle.

1397
00:57:59.084 --> 00:58:00.825
Well. do you book the talent

1398
00:58:00.868 --> 00:58:02.783
because that's the type
of audience you get.

1399
00:58:02.827 --> 00:58:04.481
or do you get
that type of audience

1400
00:58:04.524 --> 00:58:06.265
because that's
the type of comic you book?

1401
00:58:06.308 --> 00:58:08.136
I don't know
what the answer to that is.

1402
00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:11.400
but part of what makes the club
special is its identity.

1403
00:58:11.444 --> 00:58:14.186
and the identity is established
by who gets booked.

1404
00:58:14.229 --> 00:58:15.970
Because otherwise.
you're just a venue.

1405
00:58:16.623 --> 00:58:19.539
And you can be anything!
Anybody can become a venue.

1406
00:58:19.583 --> 00:58:21.759
but to have a name
as a comedy club

1407
00:58:21.802 --> 00:58:23.412
is what makes you special.

1408
00:58:23.456 --> 00:58:25.545
And so at the same time
that All Jokes Aside

1409
00:58:25.589 --> 00:58:27.678
was booking
certain types of comedians--

1410
00:58:27.721 --> 00:58:30.550
uh. Bernie Mac and. uh.
Cedric the Entertainer.

1411
00:58:30.594 --> 00:58:34.032
et cetera-- uh. Zanies had
a different group of comedians.

1412
00:58:34.075 --> 00:58:36.556
I was on a blind date.
Friend of mine set me up.

1413
00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:38.558
told me this girl
had a Coke bottle figure.

1414
00:58:38.602 --> 00:58:39.994
She had a Coke bottle figure.

1415
00:58:40.038 --> 00:58:41.256
it was one of those
two liter bottles.

1416
00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:42.562
[audience laughs]

1417
00:58:42.606 --> 00:58:44.999
Big black bottom.
twist-off head.

1418
00:58:45.043 --> 00:58:47.306
We was gonna fuckin'
beat Larry Reid at Zanies

1419
00:58:47.349 --> 00:58:49.656
because he had sensibility
and a style of comedy

1420
00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:51.484
and a particular reach.

1421
00:58:51.528 --> 00:58:54.139
but you just gotta fuck
with that guy in that room.

1422
00:58:54.182 --> 00:58:58.099
Zanies was one of the first
clubs that let me headline.

1423
00:58:58.143 --> 00:59:00.537
This is the first place I really
started working as an emcee.

1424
00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:02.930
Did two weeks. back-to-back.

1425
00:59:03.757 --> 00:59:05.716
It was poorly negotiated.
looking back.

1426
00:59:05.759 --> 00:59:09.371
[laughs]

1427
00:59:10.111 --> 00:59:12.113
Definitely got lowballed
on that one.

1428
00:59:15.769 --> 00:59:18.511
We used to do comedy
right here at this joint

1429
00:59:18.555 --> 00:59:20.165
right off of Sheffield.

1430
00:59:20.208 --> 00:59:22.733
Uh. back then it was
called Heckler's Heaven.

1431
00:59:22.776 --> 00:59:24.561
And basically it was
an open mic show for comics

1432
00:59:24.604 --> 00:59:26.127
to kind of build their chop.

1433
00:59:26.171 --> 00:59:27.694
but you could also
make a little money.

1434
00:59:27.738 --> 00:59:29.043
Like the one I think got.
like. like. uh.

1435
00:59:29.087 --> 00:59:30.784
$50 if you won the show.

1436
00:59:30.828 --> 00:59:33.178
So one night. I went on stage.

1437
00:59:33.221 --> 00:59:36.007
and after the show.
this guy approaches me.

1438
00:59:36.050 --> 00:59:38.139
"I'm with
the David Letterman Show.

1439
00:59:38.183 --> 00:59:40.011
and I'd love to get you on David
Letterman  as soon as possible."

1440
00:59:40.054 --> 00:59:42.013
So he's like.
"Well. can you meet me out back

1441
00:59:42.056 --> 00:59:43.623
and can talk about it. I mean.
exchange numbers or something?"

1442
00:59:43.667 --> 00:59:45.494
I'm like. "Okay. cool."

1443
00:59:45.538 --> 00:59:47.279
So he went out back. and then
I went and got my buddy.

1444
00:59:47.322 --> 00:59:49.760
His name was James Hannah.
he was a-- a producer

1445
00:59:49.803 --> 00:59:51.500
for the Steve Harvey Show.

1446
00:59:51.544 --> 00:59:52.719
Stand-up comedian.
Look him up. James Hannah.

1447
00:59:52.763 --> 00:59:54.199
He was my man. He passed away.

1448
00:59:54.242 --> 00:59:56.027
But anyway.
I said "Hey. James. man.

1449
00:59:56.070 --> 00:59:58.159
you-- you ain't gonna
believe this.

1450
00:59:58.203 --> 00:59:59.770
There's this guy who said he's
from the David Letterman Show.

1451
00:59:59.813 --> 01:00:01.685
but really.
I think he's hittin' on me."

1452
01:00:01.728 --> 01:00:03.469
James was like. "Well. he might
be with David Letterman."

1453
01:00:03.512 --> 01:00:05.427
I was like. "Nah. I don't know."
I didn't think so.

1454
01:00:05.471 --> 01:00:07.647
It could be. but I-- I just
thought he had ulterior motive.

1455
01:00:07.691 --> 01:00:09.475
and I'll just leave it at that.

1456
01:00:09.518 --> 01:00:11.520
So James came with me.
we went out the back door.

1457
01:00:11.564 --> 01:00:13.479
and when we got out there.

1458
01:00:13.522 --> 01:00:16.656
it was like this dude just
disappeared in a puff of smoke.

1459
01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:18.876
So anyway.
I'm watchin' the news.

1460
01:00:18.919 --> 01:00:22.053
and I see this guy
in a jumpsuit.

1461
01:00:22.096 --> 01:00:23.620
an orange prison jumpsuit.

1462
01:00:23.663 --> 01:00:26.840
Lo and behold.
it was Jeffrey Dahmer!

1463
01:00:28.450 --> 01:00:30.931
Fortunately for me.
I didn't believe that he was

1464
01:00:30.975 --> 01:00:34.543
with David Letterman.
and I wasn't attracted to him.

1465
01:00:34.587 --> 01:00:37.503
Otherwise I'd-- Would have
ended up being a pot of soup.

1466
01:00:39.418 --> 01:00:41.725
[Lance Crouther] So I had got
booked at the Comedy Cottage.

1467
01:00:41.768 --> 01:00:44.684
which is. like. 20 miles away
from where I lived.

1468
01:00:44.728 --> 01:00:47.165
And so I didn't have
a car that day.

1469
01:00:47.208 --> 01:00:48.688
so I took this train.

1470
01:00:50.559 --> 01:00:52.649
Got off about two stops
before O'Hare.

1471
01:00:52.692 --> 01:00:55.173
and then from there
I had to walk

1472
01:00:55.216 --> 01:00:57.828
through this very
white neighborhood. [laughs]

1473
01:00:58.916 --> 01:01:01.092
And I'm drivin' down River Road.

1474
01:01:01.135 --> 01:01:03.398
because the Comedy Cottage
was on River Road.

1475
01:01:03.442 --> 01:01:06.358
I'm driving under this viaduct.
and I see this cat walkin'.

1476
01:01:06.401 --> 01:01:09.491
And as I was walkin'
under the underpass.

1477
01:01:09.535 --> 01:01:12.669
uh. I heard somebody
yell out the N-word.

1478
01:01:13.757 --> 01:01:16.107
And I turned. and I saw. like.

1479
01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:20.459
there was a pickup truck. and
rage flushed through my body.

1480
01:01:20.502 --> 01:01:23.244
The idiot got stopped
at a red light.

1481
01:01:23.288 --> 01:01:24.898
and I looked on the ground.
and there was like.

1482
01:01:24.942 --> 01:01:27.553
I guess a chunk of stone.

1483
01:01:27.596 --> 01:01:30.425
you know. like. magically there.

1484
01:01:30.469 --> 01:01:32.427
And I grabbed it.

1485
01:01:32.471 --> 01:01:36.127
and I started walkin' toward
the driver's side of the car.

1486
01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:37.606
And I look.

1487
01:01:37.650 --> 01:01:39.086
and I say "Hey. that's that--

1488
01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:40.827
that's that brother
from Mary Wong."

1489
01:01:40.871 --> 01:01:43.177
As I approached.
and my arm was...

1490
01:01:43.221 --> 01:01:45.614
[stammering]

1491
01:01:45.658 --> 01:01:48.182
...throw this big chunk of stone

1492
01:01:48.226 --> 01:01:50.489
through the windshield.
through the window.

1493
01:01:51.359 --> 01:01:52.970
I heard. "Lenny!"

1494
01:01:54.232 --> 01:01:55.973
Said. "Who? What?"

1495
01:01:56.016 --> 01:01:57.888
I turned around.
and it was Dwayne.

1496
01:01:57.931 --> 01:02:00.368
and he was grinning
from ear to ear.

1497
01:02:01.021 --> 01:02:04.764
And about at that point.
the pickup truck drove off.

1498
01:02:04.808 --> 01:02:07.811
And I'm standing there with
a big chunk of stone in my hand.

1499
01:02:07.854 --> 01:02:09.900
He's like.
"Man. what are you doin'?"

1500
01:02:09.943 --> 01:02:11.728
I said. "Aw. man.
I was just about to

1501
01:02:11.771 --> 01:02:13.555
hit a white boy in the head
with a brick. man."

1502
01:02:17.995 --> 01:02:19.910
[Kara Buller] My dad's
a very proud Midwesterner.

1503
01:02:19.953 --> 01:02:22.216
and he called me the other day.
He was very upset. He said.

1504
01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:24.523
you know. "In the paper.
they were calling somebody a--

1505
01:02:24.566 --> 01:02:26.786
They said he was wearing
a very Midwestern suit!"

1506
01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:28.309
And he's like. "Kara.
what-- what does this mean.

1507
01:02:28.353 --> 01:02:29.963
a Midwestern suit?"

1508
01:02:30.007 --> 01:02:32.444
I said. "Uh. well. Dad.
a-- a Midwestern suit.

1509
01:02:32.487 --> 01:02:34.576
I believe. is a suit
with a secret pocket

1510
01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:36.317
stitched into it
in which you place

1511
01:02:36.361 --> 01:02:38.145
your unspoken racial prejudices.

1512
01:02:38.189 --> 01:02:40.278
That's-- that's--
that's what it is. yeah.

1513
01:02:40.887 --> 01:02:43.847
Uh. I've got my own."
You know? [laughs]

1514
01:02:43.890 --> 01:02:47.502
A lot of my comedy
focused on race

1515
01:02:47.546 --> 01:02:50.331
and racism. and. you know.
and-- and those.

1516
01:02:50.375 --> 01:02:54.379
and-- and encounters with.
uh. various ethnic groups.

1517
01:02:54.422 --> 01:02:55.989
Primarily white folks.

1518
01:02:56.033 --> 01:02:57.686
I used to let
white folks have it. man.

1519
01:02:57.730 --> 01:02:59.471
just right out the gate.

1520
01:02:59.514 --> 01:03:01.299
Just. you know.
"Let me tell you something.

1521
01:03:01.342 --> 01:03:04.606
Your pathological greed
and compulsive need for control

1522
01:03:04.650 --> 01:03:07.348
has been the single
most source of pain and misery

1523
01:03:07.392 --> 01:03:10.525
for people of color throughout
this world for generations!"

1524
01:03:10.569 --> 01:03:13.398
But I try not to say
things like that anymore.

1525
01:03:13.441 --> 01:03:16.531
[audience laughs]

1526
01:03:16.575 --> 01:03:18.795
'Cause I have found
once you have said

1527
01:03:18.838 --> 01:03:20.797
something like that
to a white person.

1528
01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:22.973
you almost never
get a second date.

1529
01:03:23.016 --> 01:03:25.192
-You know what I mean?
-[audience laughs]

1530
01:03:25.236 --> 01:03:27.107
'Cause I was really
influenced by Richard Pryor

1531
01:03:27.151 --> 01:03:29.893
and all those things. so I--
I really like stuff about race.

1532
01:03:29.936 --> 01:03:32.591
and just. you know. um...

1533
01:03:32.634 --> 01:03:34.593
I don't know what the truth is.
but. you know.

1534
01:03:34.636 --> 01:03:36.160
things that were just more--

1535
01:03:37.204 --> 01:03:39.076
I don't know. confrontational.

1536
01:03:39.119 --> 01:03:41.513
[Lance Crouther] Somebody
I heard earlier mention Chica--

1537
01:03:41.556 --> 01:03:43.167
you know.
who's your favorite comedian.

1538
01:03:43.210 --> 01:03:45.299
and you mention somebody
nobody's ever heard of.

1539
01:03:45.865 --> 01:03:48.259
And that was me with Dwayne.
'cause I would say. you know.

1540
01:03:48.302 --> 01:03:49.869
someone-- "Who was the funniest
person you know outside?"

1541
01:03:49.913 --> 01:03:52.002
"Oh. Dwayne Kennedy." [laughs]

1542
01:03:52.045 --> 01:03:53.525
And people go.
"Who the hell is that?"

1543
01:03:53.568 --> 01:03:54.743
I don't know
who Dwayne Kennedy is.

1544
01:03:54.787 --> 01:03:56.093
Yeah. no.

1545
01:03:56.136 --> 01:03:57.268
Dwayne Kennedy?

1546
01:03:58.356 --> 01:03:59.879
No. Not off the top of my head.

1547
01:04:00.662 --> 01:04:02.447
Who is he?

1548
01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:04.405
Dwayne Kennedy's. like.
the Picasso of stand-up comedy.

1549
01:04:04.449 --> 01:04:07.017
But the Modigliani
of personal finances.

1550
01:04:08.235 --> 01:04:12.022
I remember Dwayne
having notebooks.

1551
01:04:12.065 --> 01:04:13.675
hundreds of notebooks.

1552
01:04:13.719 --> 01:04:15.199
I would look at these notebooks.
and I would just

1553
01:04:15.242 --> 01:04:17.941
start laughing
hysterically out loud.

1554
01:04:17.984 --> 01:04:19.899
Like.
tears rolling down my eyes.

1555
01:04:19.943 --> 01:04:22.423
In fact. I took one of these
notebooks to a Bulls game.

1556
01:04:22.467 --> 01:04:24.077
An early one with Jordan.

1557
01:04:24.817 --> 01:04:26.514
And I remember Jordan dunking.

1558
01:04:26.558 --> 01:04:28.865
and I wasn't even
paying attention to the game

1559
01:04:28.908 --> 01:04:31.606
'cause I was screaming laughing.
So I go to Dwayne.

1560
01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:33.434
I said "Dwayne. man.
you gotta do this!"

1561
01:04:33.478 --> 01:04:35.262
"Ah. man. I didn't--
I didn't-- That's not funny."

1562
01:04:36.350 --> 01:04:38.439
I go. "You--
you gotta be kiddin. man!"

1563
01:04:38.483 --> 01:04:41.181
He's like. "I-- It--
it's just not workin' for me."

1564
01:04:41.225 --> 01:04:44.097
So his-- What he considered
his worst material

1565
01:04:44.141 --> 01:04:45.794
would have been--

1566
01:04:45.838 --> 01:04:48.406
made four
other people's careers.

1567
01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:51.713
But Dwayne's a nut.

1568
01:04:51.757 --> 01:04:53.890
I'm thinkin' I gotta get
back into stand-up. man.

1569
01:04:54.499 --> 01:04:57.502
You know. I don't know
when the Rona's gonna die out.

1570
01:04:57.545 --> 01:05:00.809
but I'm gonna get-- I'm gonna
get boosted. re-boosted Monday.

1571
01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:04.770
Maybe I'll crawl back up
on the stage Tuesday.

1572
01:05:06.467 --> 01:05:08.687
[chuckles] And then Wednesday.

1573
01:05:08.730 --> 01:05:11.298
Wednesday morning.
regret that decision.

1574
01:05:11.342 --> 01:05:13.039
So Dwayne made a video tape--

1575
01:05:13.083 --> 01:05:15.041
You know. you shoot--
you work a club

1576
01:05:15.085 --> 01:05:17.087
and you get. like.
a little video tape of your--

1577
01:05:17.130 --> 01:05:19.393
your act.
about five minutes long.

1578
01:05:19.437 --> 01:05:22.092
Dwayne took that video.
he sent it to this guy in LA.

1579
01:05:22.135 --> 01:05:25.269
who showed the video to NBC.

1580
01:05:25.312 --> 01:05:27.097
They signed Dwayne.

1581
01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:31.014
So that year.
he was on Seinfeldvideo 227.

1582
01:05:31.057 --> 01:05:34.147
and he did the other one where
he was Halle Berry's boyfriend.

1583
01:05:34.191 --> 01:05:35.496
Nobody knew who Halle Berry was.

1584
01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:37.281
He was bigger than Halle Berry.

1585
01:05:37.803 --> 01:05:39.761
Oh. boy. Depressing.

1586
01:05:39.805 --> 01:05:41.807
Do you know how people
are really good at something.

1587
01:05:41.850 --> 01:05:45.637
so if you're just
a little not good at something.

1588
01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:49.293
you work harder. and it actually
probably helps you with success?

1589
01:05:49.336 --> 01:05:51.208
Like. if you're
perfect at something

1590
01:05:51.251 --> 01:05:54.951
where it just almost is--
it's like eating breakfast?

1591
01:05:55.734 --> 01:05:57.997
So you don't really think of it
as a gift or a skill.

1592
01:05:58.041 --> 01:05:59.477
You just think of.
I'm eating breakfast.

1593
01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:01.174
So Dwayne is that good.
where he just--

1594
01:06:01.218 --> 01:06:03.176
he's eating breakfast.

1595
01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:05.700
[Dwayne] I was eating it pretty
regularly up until last week.

1596
01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:07.615
I'm gettin' back on it.

1597
01:06:09.574 --> 01:06:10.967
I'll get some running shoes.

1598
01:06:12.751 --> 01:06:16.059
You know. plaid. [laughs]

1599
01:06:16.102 --> 01:06:17.625
It's not like
the end of Trainspotting.

1600
01:06:17.669 --> 01:06:19.627
[laughs]

1601
01:06:20.585 --> 01:06:23.457
Get running shoes. join a gym.

1602
01:06:23.501 --> 01:06:26.286
Hit a treadmill.
Lift some weights.

1603
01:06:26.330 --> 01:06:29.289
If he was
a little less good-- [laughs]

1604
01:06:29.333 --> 01:06:31.291
he probably would have
been successful.

1605
01:06:31.335 --> 01:06:33.902
'cause he would have had more
motivation to achieve something.

1606
01:06:36.079 --> 01:06:39.256
Lance and Ali wrote
on The Chris Rock Show.

1607
01:06:40.083 --> 01:06:42.302
Lance goes on
to become Pootie Tang.

1608
01:06:42.346 --> 01:06:43.956
And so I end up in a movie.

1609
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.871
[laughs]

1610
01:06:45.914 --> 01:06:47.699
And it was crazy.
it was this weird movie

1611
01:06:47.742 --> 01:06:48.961
that everybody thought
was gonna be

1612
01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:51.007
like a Black Austin Powers.

1613
01:06:51.050 --> 01:06:53.357
and I was workin' on
On The Record with Bob Costas.

1614
01:06:53.966 --> 01:06:57.187
So I said.
"Bob. what if you introduce me

1615
01:06:57.230 --> 01:07:00.625
and say 'This is Pootie Tang.
blah. blah. blah'?"

1616
01:07:00.668 --> 01:07:02.670
And he goes.
"I'd love to do it!"

1617
01:07:02.714 --> 01:07:04.629
The movie comes out.

1618
01:07:04.672 --> 01:07:06.283
The New York Timesgives it
a really good review.

1619
01:07:06.326 --> 01:07:08.241
Everybody else.
"It's the worst movie ever."

1620
01:07:08.285 --> 01:07:10.983
Who do they single out?
Bob Costas.

1621
01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:13.464
Bob Costas is in every review.

1622
01:07:13.507 --> 01:07:15.553
"How dare you be in this trash!"

1623
01:07:15.596 --> 01:07:17.990
I get a call from Bob Costas.

1624
01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:20.993
"I try to do
favors for friends."

1625
01:07:21.037 --> 01:07:24.649
I go "Friends? I never heard
Bob say that I'm Bob's friend!

1626
01:07:24.692 --> 01:07:27.130
Never heard that one before.
Okay!"

1627
01:07:27.173 --> 01:07:31.047
But sometimes you get
burnt in the ass. okay?

1628
01:07:31.090 --> 01:07:32.744
I'm not Bob's friend anymore!

1629
01:07:32.787 --> 01:07:35.268
In the same sentence.
it happened. [chuckles]

1630
01:07:36.008 --> 01:07:38.054
"Gee.
I wish I had never done that!"

1631
01:07:38.097 --> 01:07:39.490
He actually said that to me.

1632
01:07:39.533 --> 01:07:42.101
I go. "Wow.
I couldn't feel worse."

1633
01:07:42.145 --> 01:07:43.929
[laughs]

1634
01:07:43.972 --> 01:07:47.498
But over time.
I would get a call from Bob

1635
01:07:47.541 --> 01:07:49.978
or run into him.
and he would go...

1636
01:07:51.110 --> 01:07:52.981
"That movie. I hate it."

1637
01:07:53.025 --> 01:07:54.635
And then next time I'd see him.
"That movie is all right."

1638
01:07:54.679 --> 01:07:56.594
Next time I'd see him.

1639
01:07:56.637 --> 01:07:58.248
"Me and my son went to see
that movie again. Wasn't bad."

1640
01:07:58.291 --> 01:07:59.466
And next I'd see him.
"I love the movie!"

1641
01:07:59.510 --> 01:08:01.207
And so based on Bob. I would go.

1642
01:08:01.251 --> 01:08:03.992
"Oh. that's where
the movie is. and the culture."

1643
01:08:04.036 --> 01:08:06.691
Because it's become
this cult thing.

1644
01:08:06.734 --> 01:08:10.129
that it went from
horrible. horrible. horrible

1645
01:08:10.173 --> 01:08:13.132
to "Oh. that's really
a kooky. crazy thing."

1646
01:08:13.176 --> 01:08:17.310
and that performance
is Mary Wong in its essence.

1647
01:08:17.354 --> 01:08:20.705
Whatever you expect. let's try
to flip the expectation. What

1648
01:08:20.748 --> 01:08:22.533
can we do to help him?

1649
01:08:22.576 --> 01:08:25.188
We could send them
to a drug rehabilitation center.

1650
01:08:25.231 --> 01:08:28.887
This would all cost
the taxpayers 23.50 a day.

1651
01:08:28.930 --> 01:08:31.498
Eventually. he'd be through it
and he'd leave the center.

1652
01:08:31.542 --> 01:08:34.632
but knowing him. he'd probably
start drinking again.

1653
01:08:34.675 --> 01:08:37.896
-[indistinct]
-And before you know it.

1654
01:08:37.939 --> 01:08:39.898
he'd end up
right back here again.

1655
01:08:39.941 --> 01:08:43.641
a drunken asshole. once again
costing us 23.50 a day.

1656
01:08:43.684 --> 01:08:47.471
-So...

1657
01:08:52.606 --> 01:08:54.869
There was a club
in Oak Lawn. Illinois.

1658
01:08:54.913 --> 01:08:57.002
which is right next to Chicago.

1659
01:08:57.045 --> 01:08:59.265
So basically. just Chicago club

1660
01:08:59.309 --> 01:09:01.267
called. the. uh.
the Barrel of Laughs.

1661
01:09:01.311 --> 01:09:03.400
And this was a club that. uh.

1662
01:09:03.443 --> 01:09:05.271
a cat named Bill Brady
used to run.

1663
01:09:05.315 --> 01:09:07.578
We had an entranceway
that looked like a barrel.

1664
01:09:07.621 --> 01:09:09.145
so we came through the barrel.

1665
01:09:09.188 --> 01:09:10.885
Our tables
were made out of barrels.

1666
01:09:10.929 --> 01:09:13.279
So it was natural
to call it the Barrel of Laughs.

1667
01:09:13.323 --> 01:09:16.456
[Dwayne]
And now that was a place

1668
01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:20.373
where you might
encounter some things.

1669
01:09:20.417 --> 01:09:23.071
I was a customer at a place
called Senese's Winery.

1670
01:09:23.115 --> 01:09:24.638
and it was a. uh. restaurant.

1671
01:09:24.682 --> 01:09:27.598
When I got into comedy
back in 1976.

1672
01:09:27.641 --> 01:09:30.688
I proposed the idea
to Tom and Terry Senese

1673
01:09:30.731 --> 01:09:32.342
about taking over
a Tuesday night.

1674
01:09:32.385 --> 01:09:34.257
which they had nothing
there on Tuesday nights.

1675
01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:36.041
to do a comedy show.

1676
01:09:36.084 --> 01:09:38.435
We used to go to Senese's
as a family for dinner!

1677
01:09:38.478 --> 01:09:39.958
Mother's Day. Father's Day.

1678
01:09:40.001 --> 01:09:42.221
And I would see
the signs as a kid.

1679
01:09:42.265 --> 01:09:44.484
so when I started doing
open mics. believe it or not.

1680
01:09:44.528 --> 01:09:47.922
it was one of my dreams
to work at the Barrel of Laughs.

1681
01:09:47.966 --> 01:09:52.536
Um. did I know that it was
a closed-minded. racist club?

1682
01:09:52.579 --> 01:09:54.015
Probably not.

1683
01:09:54.059 --> 01:09:56.017
I remember one time
I was on stage.

1684
01:09:56.061 --> 01:09:58.716
and I was. you know.
whatever I was doing...

1685
01:09:59.673 --> 01:10:01.675
and a woman...

1686
01:10:02.676 --> 01:10:05.679
kept just yellin' out.
"Are you Black?"

1687
01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:08.508
And. um...

1688
01:10:08.552 --> 01:10:11.250
uh. you know. I don't know
why. uh. she needed ver--

1689
01:10:11.294 --> 01:10:13.252
to have it verified to her.

1690
01:10:13.296 --> 01:10:15.254
I don't know what was goin' on.
I don't know if she was. like--

1691
01:10:15.298 --> 01:10:17.256
the-- that she was
the scout for the group.

1692
01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:19.824
Somebody in the audience said

1693
01:10:19.867 --> 01:10:22.043
something like
"rat-faced Jew..."

1694
01:10:22.087 --> 01:10:25.395
[laughs] ...to me
from the audience.

1695
01:10:25.438 --> 01:10:28.528
and I-- I was. uh.
pretty taken aback.

1696
01:10:29.312 --> 01:10:31.662
I don't remember
what I said. but I was--

1697
01:10:31.705 --> 01:10:33.838
The funny thing was.
I was having a good set.

1698
01:10:33.881 --> 01:10:35.796
I grew up in that neighborhood!
And it was just the way

1699
01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.668
that everybody thought.
except for my family. 'cause.

1700
01:10:37.711 --> 01:10:39.409
you know. we're smarter.
sharper.

1701
01:10:39.452 --> 01:10:41.454
I used to call that place
the "Barrel of Bigots."

1702
01:10:41.498 --> 01:10:43.587
And then Bill found out
I was callin' it that.

1703
01:10:43.630 --> 01:10:45.763
and he didn't think it was
as funny as I thought it was.

1704
01:10:45.806 --> 01:10:49.810
Now. comedy is-- is.
uh. um. very subjective.

1705
01:10:49.854 --> 01:10:51.986
because what one person
thinks is funny.

1706
01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:53.988
another person
doesn't think is funny.

1707
01:10:54.032 --> 01:10:57.427
I like Bill. and to his credit.
he gave me stage time.

1708
01:10:57.470 --> 01:11:01.169
But he would-- he would never
really put anybody in check.

1709
01:11:01.213 --> 01:11:03.171
You know.
he would never say. you know.

1710
01:11:03.215 --> 01:11:08.176
"Hey. listen. you. uh. gotta.
you know. tone down on the--

the brother's show is over.

You know. once the show is over.

1713

you could ask him is he Black

I was wonderin' that myself."

1715
01:11:17.055 --> 01:11:19.405
Sometimes I'm questioned
about whether or not

1716
01:11:19.449 --> 01:11:23.061
it is our responsibility
as a booker or a club owner.

1717
01:11:23.104 --> 01:11:26.369

I hold all three hats--

our audience to diversity.

1719
01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:32.200
Uh. I think. uh.
it is not really our job.

That should be done at home.

My job is to put on a--
a good. clean. funny show.

1723
01:11:40.513 --> 01:11:42.428
[Jimmy Pardo] He also had some
weird rule that you couldn't

1724
01:11:42.472 --> 01:11:44.604
say the F-word. You couldn't--
you couldn't say "fuck."

I don't know why I'm being clean
now. You couldn't say "fuck."

1726
01:11:46.693 --> 01:11:49.783
I kinda had the rule that if it
wasn't good enough for my mom

1727
01:11:49.827 --> 01:11:52.699
to hear. it wasn't good enough
for anybody's mom to hear.

1728
01:11:52.743 --> 01:11:55.006
But yet he could
put panties on his head.

1729
01:11:55.049 --> 01:11:57.835
He could dance around.
He said "leprecoon" once.

1730
01:11:57.878 --> 01:11:59.619
That's acceptable.

1731
01:11:59.663 --> 01:12:02.100
To be diplomatic.
I guess. he grew as a person.

1732
01:12:02.143 --> 01:12:04.407
I don't think he's done
that "leprecoon" bit in weeks.

to replace the word "fuck"

was I would say "goddamn."

01:15:44.104 --> 01:15:46.977
"We don't pay air no more."
and. you know.

1819
01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:50.197
I had four kids and
I was already both feet in...

1820
01:15:51.155 --> 01:15:53.200
and I didn't wanna go back
to drivin' a truck.

1821
01:15:58.075 --> 01:16:00.991
For me. it was really
funny because as I. uh.

1822
01:16:01.034 --> 01:16:04.124
as I progressed and-- and--
and became more successful

1823
01:16:04.168 --> 01:16:06.518
in the business. um.

1824
01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:09.390
the-- the-- the money
was goin' down.

1825
01:16:09.434 --> 01:16:13.264
So I didn't really notice
that I was going up

1826
01:16:13.307 --> 01:16:14.918
or that the money
was goin' down.

1827
01:16:14.961 --> 01:16:17.921
'cause for me.
it just stayed exactly the same

1828
01:16:17.964 --> 01:16:19.400
for 20 years.

1829
01:16:23.317 --> 01:16:27.017
Bob Odenkirk and I
sat outside Zanies.

1830
01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:28.975
sat outside Second City
many times.

1831
01:16:29.019 --> 01:16:32.631
talking about how
the comedy scene

1832
01:16:32.675 --> 01:16:34.546
in this city was ignoring us.

1833
01:16:35.068 --> 01:16:37.027
At least on the larger level.
I mean.

1834
01:16:37.070 --> 01:16:38.985
What we were gonna do.
Just failing.

1835
01:16:39.029 --> 01:16:40.900
You know.
feel like we were failures.

1836
01:16:40.944 --> 01:16:42.772
I think there are a lot of
successful comedians in Chicago.

1837
01:16:42.815 --> 01:16:44.382
It's more working class.

1838
01:16:44.425 --> 01:16:46.514
There's. uh.
hundreds of comedians

1839
01:16:46.558 --> 01:16:47.820
that actually make a living.

1840
01:16:51.215 --> 01:16:52.651
[Rocky LaPorte]
You tough it out. you know?

1841
01:16:52.695 --> 01:16:54.697
And you just--
you gotta work more.

1842
01:16:54.740 --> 01:16:56.960
As time went on. I became more
confident in what I was doing.

1843
01:16:57.003 --> 01:17:00.485
I did start to do-- Like.
Bernie Mac used to have a room

1844
01:17:00.528 --> 01:17:02.574
that we do when he was in town.

1845
01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:04.924
Uh. this place Milt Trenier's
that he would do

1846
01:17:04.968 --> 01:17:07.057
on every Tuesday
if he was in town.

1847
01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:09.799
And I did his room.
and it was fantastic.

1848
01:17:09.842 --> 01:17:11.409
But-- See.
but here's the thing...

1849
01:17:12.410 --> 01:17:16.632
Bernie trained
his audiences. you know?

1850
01:17:16.675 --> 01:17:18.503
He-- When you came in.
he would tell you.

1851
01:17:18.546 --> 01:17:21.724
"Look. you know.
you-- you take your hats off.

1852
01:17:21.767 --> 01:17:24.988
you-- there's no cell phones.
there's-- you know.

1853
01:17:25.031 --> 01:17:26.424
there's no heckling."

1854
01:17:26.467 --> 01:17:28.252
You know.
you respect the artist.

1855
01:17:28.295 --> 01:17:30.297
So that was cool.
So he groomed the audience.

1856
01:17:30.341 --> 01:17:33.692
and so anybody who was-- who was
inclined to do those things.

1857
01:17:33.736 --> 01:17:35.694
they didn't--
they didn't show up at his room.

1858
01:17:35.738 --> 01:17:38.131
Bernie was different from. um...

1859
01:17:39.306 --> 01:17:42.266
other Black. uh. comics.

1860
01:17:42.309 --> 01:17:45.182
Like. his shows
started at eight.

1861
01:17:45.225 --> 01:17:46.792
and I opened up.

1862
01:17:46.836 --> 01:17:49.099
I was on the stage at 8:01.

1863
01:17:49.142 --> 01:17:53.973
The audience wasn't there
until 8:15. 8:20.

1864
01:17:54.017 --> 01:17:58.151
so they're slowly straggling in.

1865
01:17:58.195 --> 01:18:01.241
Uh. they're. "Who was this--
who was this brother?"

1866
01:18:01.285 --> 01:18:04.505
And. uh. and they hated me
in the beginning.

1867
01:18:04.549 --> 01:18:06.333
They hated me with a passion.

1868
01:18:06.377 --> 01:18:08.205
And I knew
I was gonna get booed.

1869
01:18:08.248 --> 01:18:09.946
'cause I was
a clean Christian comic.

1870
01:18:09.989 --> 01:18:13.558
It was funny to me
that they hated me so much.

1871
01:18:13.601 --> 01:18:16.561
And they would.
uh. they would cuss me out.

1872
01:18:16.604 --> 01:18:19.695
and their veins
would be showing.

1873
01:18:19.738 --> 01:18:23.220
And but because I have been
doing comedy for so long.

1874
01:18:23.263 --> 01:18:25.875
they didn't scare me.
I'd just pause. and I--

1875
01:18:25.918 --> 01:18:30.314
I would say. "Hey.
if you're quiet. I could finish.

1876
01:18:30.357 --> 01:18:32.446
and then Bernie could come out."

1877
01:18:32.490 --> 01:18:35.145
-And silence.
-[crickets chirping]

1878
01:18:36.276 --> 01:18:38.931
And he told me.
he said. "Tony...

1879
01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:41.891
understand. if you were dirty.

1880
01:18:41.934 --> 01:18:44.154
I would have to be dirtier.

1881
01:18:44.763 --> 01:18:47.331
So it's cool that you're clean.

1882
01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:49.681
His first line was

1883
01:18:49.725 --> 01:18:52.031
"Church is over.
motherfuckers!"

1884
01:18:52.945 --> 01:18:55.165
That-- that would be
his first line.

1885
01:18:55.208 --> 01:18:57.776
'Cause I've been clean
for 30 minutes.

1886
01:18:57.820 --> 01:18:59.778
and then he would come out.

1887
01:18:59.822 --> 01:19:03.956
and people'd be rolling. "Yeah!
Church is over. motherfuckers!"

1888
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.177
[audience applauding]

1889
01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:09.788
It's still really. really...

1890
01:19:09.832 --> 01:19:12.312
I've had the fortunate
experience of touring with him

1891
01:19:12.356 --> 01:19:15.576
for the Kings of Comedy Tour.
so we did 30 dates together.

1892
01:19:15.620 --> 01:19:17.274
and a lot of times
I would ride with him.

1893
01:19:17.317 --> 01:19:19.276
you know. same place.
same hotel. same limo.

1894
01:19:19.319 --> 01:19:20.930
so you got a lot of exposure.

1895
01:19:20.973 --> 01:19:23.628
But he told me earlier
in my career. he said--

1896
01:19:23.671 --> 01:19:26.109
Two things. He said. "That first
hour of material's gonna come.

1897
01:19:26.152 --> 01:19:28.285
that second hour's
gonna be difficult.

1898
01:19:28.328 --> 01:19:30.766
And pay your taxes. pimp!"

1899
01:19:30.809 --> 01:19:32.376
And he was right about both.

1900
01:19:32.419 --> 01:19:34.030
The first hour came.
and I fought to get

1901
01:19:34.073 --> 01:19:35.988
to the second hour.
and I still owe taxes.

1902
01:19:36.772 --> 01:19:38.817
He was very influential.

1903
01:19:38.861 --> 01:19:41.646
He just kind of was.
you know. like. hand-in-hand

1904
01:19:41.689 --> 01:19:43.039
with what eventually
would become

1905
01:19:43.082 --> 01:19:44.344
the Def Comedy Jam movement.

1906
01:19:44.388 --> 01:19:45.563
That whole thing.

1907
01:19:45.606 --> 01:19:47.217
He spoke to a certain audience.

1908
01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:49.654
but the thing
I appreciated most about it.

1909
01:19:49.697 --> 01:19:50.786
and it was brilliant.

1910
01:19:51.482 --> 01:19:52.570
He never changed.

1911
01:19:52.613 --> 01:19:54.702
He just never gave up.

1912
01:19:54.746 --> 01:19:57.575
I never seen someb--
someone work as hard

1913
01:19:57.618 --> 01:19:59.533
and stay focused.
and then he used to all be--

1914
01:19:59.577 --> 01:20:01.405
always would.
Bernie would talk about

1915
01:20:01.448 --> 01:20:03.929
was being disciplined.
stayin' focused.

1916
01:20:03.973 --> 01:20:05.365
Uh. there's room at the Cross.

1917
01:20:05.409 --> 01:20:06.627
He was.
"There's room at the Cross?

1918
01:20:06.671 --> 01:20:08.412
You gotta sell what you want.

1919
01:20:08.455 --> 01:20:10.022
If you stay focused.
ain't nothing wrong with it.

1920
01:20:10.066 --> 01:20:11.850
You know you're gonna
make it sometime."

1921
01:20:11.894 --> 01:20:13.896
He was who he was gonna be.
and that was his act.

1922
01:20:13.939 --> 01:20:17.029
and you either liked it
or you didn't.

1923
01:20:17.073 --> 01:20:18.944
which I think is why
it took him probably as long

1924
01:20:18.988 --> 01:20:22.600
as it took him.
quote unquote. to "hit it huge."

1925
01:20:22.643 --> 01:20:24.994
When he died. it was. um...

1926
01:20:42.185 --> 01:20:43.882
he was a friend. [crying]

1927
01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:45.841
That's all.

1928
01:20:47.190 --> 01:20:50.976
There were 7.000 people.

1929
01:20:51.020 --> 01:20:52.108
[sniffs]

1930
01:21:00.116 --> 01:21:01.204
Yeah.

1931
01:21:08.037 --> 01:21:10.082
Such is-- such is life.

1932
01:21:11.083 --> 01:21:13.172
Yeah. He was a good friend.

1933
01:21:19.613 --> 01:21:21.354
I led with the comics
that influenced me.

1934
01:21:22.355 --> 01:21:25.968
You know what I'm saying? Like.
Deon Cole influenced me to know

1935
01:21:26.011 --> 01:21:28.013
that I guess we all can.

1936
01:21:28.057 --> 01:21:30.624
'Cause if-- You know when you
meet somebody that close to you.

1937
01:21:30.668 --> 01:21:32.670
like. you've seen
their rise a little bit.

1938
01:21:32.713 --> 01:21:34.933
you know what I mean? You like.
"Oh. this shit can happen!"

1939
01:21:34.977 --> 01:21:37.022
You can break into
the mainstream and be yourself.

1940
01:21:37.066 --> 01:21:40.025
and be funny. and get these
jobs. and write on stuff.

1941
01:21:40.069 --> 01:21:41.809
So it's like.
I hope I'm the same thing

1942
01:21:41.853 --> 01:21:43.724
for a bunch of other people.

1943
01:21:43.768 --> 01:21:46.423
You know what I'm sayin'?
And Hannibal is that. TJ's that.

1944
01:21:46.466 --> 01:21:49.513
I was doing acting classes
on the weekends during the day.

1945
01:21:49.556 --> 01:21:52.559
working an 8:00
to 6:00 p.m. job.

1946
01:21:52.603 --> 01:21:54.257
performing every single night.

1947
01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:57.477
and doing sketch also.
and improv. and video.

1948
01:21:57.521 --> 01:21:59.653
and stand-up.
and those acting classes.

1949
01:21:59.697 --> 01:22:02.221
ideally would lead
to some sort of commercial work.

1950
01:22:02.265 --> 01:22:04.397
Which they eventually did.
but I found out very quickly

1951
01:22:04.441 --> 01:22:07.139
if you work harder
than anybody else.

1952
01:22:07.183 --> 01:22:09.228
no matter what your talent is.
look at me.

1953
01:22:09.272 --> 01:22:11.622
You know. a modicum of talent.
mediocre talent.

1954
01:22:11.665 --> 01:22:13.711
-Please.
-Work ethic that far exceeds

1955
01:22:13.754 --> 01:22:15.408
-any of my peers--
-Well.

1956
01:22:15.452 --> 01:22:17.410
And Yogi Bear 3D.

1957
01:22:17.454 --> 01:22:20.022
A few years ago. I remember
I walked down to the Sony lot.

1958
01:22:20.065 --> 01:22:22.372
and there's a giant billboard
of The Goldbergs.

1959
01:22:22.415 --> 01:22:25.462
right next to a giant billboard
of Better Call Saul.

1960
01:22:25.505 --> 01:22:27.551
I took a picture of it
and sent it to him.

1961
01:22:27.594 --> 01:22:30.032
Um. I said
"Look at us now." [laughs]

1962
01:22:30.075 --> 01:22:31.598
The Chi makes--

1963
01:22:32.730 --> 01:22:34.732
Man. it makes
some strong people. man.

1964
01:22:34.775 --> 01:22:36.734
Chicago's known
for its gangster city.

1965
01:22:36.777 --> 01:22:39.041
Well. the comics is
gangsters too. motherfucker!

1966
01:22:39.084 --> 01:22:40.694
I go out to lunch a lot.

1967
01:22:42.392 --> 01:22:44.002
I work out.

1968
01:22:44.046 --> 01:22:46.222
I got clean. You know.
I cleaned up my act.

1969
01:22:46.265 --> 01:22:48.050
I go on a lot of meetings.

1970
01:22:48.093 --> 01:22:50.008
People really like me.
[chuckles]

1971
01:22:50.052 --> 01:22:51.618
Do they give me anything? No.

1972
01:22:51.662 --> 01:22:53.142
But they're like.
"She's so fun."

1973
01:22:53.185 --> 01:22:55.796
I drink a lot.
I smoke a lot of weed.

1974
01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:57.146
I write jokes.

1975
01:22:57.189 --> 01:22:58.756
Um. I give a lot of hugs.

1976
01:22:58.799 --> 01:23:00.236
Even to people that are like.

1977
01:23:00.279 --> 01:23:01.933
"I didn't think
she was gonna hug me."

1978
01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:03.848
So. I'm nice.
I like bop around. you know.

1979
01:23:03.891 --> 01:23:06.285
Chicago is a great place
to get good.

1980
01:23:06.329 --> 01:23:08.548
Chicago's not the place
where you're gonna get famous.

1981
01:23:08.592 --> 01:23:11.029
A lot of people will think you
have to move there eventually.

1982
01:23:11.073 --> 01:23:12.726
uh. New York or LA.

1983
01:23:12.770 --> 01:23:14.554
um. but I think
there is something to be said

1984
01:23:14.598 --> 01:23:18.210
for making a success
out of your career in Chicago.

1985
01:23:18.254 --> 01:23:20.212
where you live.
where other people

1986
01:23:20.256 --> 01:23:21.735
can have access to it.

1987
01:23:21.779 --> 01:23:24.390
What would be cool is if that

1988
01:23:24.434 --> 01:23:26.349
those people
who develop in Chicago.

1989
01:23:26.392 --> 01:23:30.962
there was enough going on as
far as. uh. national media that

1990
01:23:31.006 --> 01:23:33.834
they didn't have to necessarily
leave Chicago. you know?

1991
01:23:33.878 --> 01:23:36.533
That you could-- If there
was a nightly talk show

1992
01:23:36.576 --> 01:23:40.058
in Chicago or something where
comedians could get exposure.

1993
01:23:40.102 --> 01:23:42.191
you know.
just like they go to New York

1994
01:23:42.234 --> 01:23:44.410
to do Jimmy Fallon
or you go to LA

1995
01:23:44.454 --> 01:23:46.238
to tape a Netflix special.

1996
01:23:46.282 --> 01:23:48.719
If there was some shows
like that happening in Chicago.

1997
01:23:48.762 --> 01:23:50.808
then that would make it.
you know. full circle.

1998
01:23:50.851 --> 01:23:54.333
So you could develop in Chicago.
you could get good in Chicago.

1999
01:23:54.377 --> 01:23:57.684
and you could stay in Chicago
to get some national exposure.

2000
01:23:58.120 --> 01:23:59.208
I think--

2001
01:24:00.687 --> 01:24:02.733
I don't know. I think there is
a comedy boom right now.

2002
01:24:03.690 --> 01:24:06.954
Seems like a lot of people
wanna come see shows.

2003
01:24:06.998 --> 01:24:10.697
and they-- and-- and--
and the scene is-- is thrivin'.

2004
01:24:10.741 --> 01:24:13.265
I don't think the industry
has any idea how red-hot

2005
01:24:13.309 --> 01:24:15.180
stand-up is in Chicago.
I think the rest of the country

2006
01:24:15.224 --> 01:24:16.921
is gonna figure this out.

2007
01:24:16.964 --> 01:24:19.271
I am just waiting
for everyone to be brown.

2008
01:24:19.315 --> 01:24:21.012
I don't know how many
generations it's gonna take.

2009
01:24:21.056 --> 01:24:23.493
I don't know how many
Black and white people

2010
01:24:23.536 --> 01:24:26.496
need to make sweet.
sweet love to each other.

2011
01:24:26.539 --> 01:24:29.064
[Dwayne] You find now
there are Black folks

2012
01:24:29.107 --> 01:24:31.501
who are more open
as an audience.

2013
01:24:31.544 --> 01:24:34.591
more open to things
then they may have been

2014
01:24:34.634 --> 01:24:36.854
years and years ago.
as far as accepting

2015
01:24:36.897 --> 01:24:39.030
a certain type of style.

2016
01:24:39.074 --> 01:24:41.989
or certain type of comedian.
or a certain presentation.

2017
01:24:42.033 --> 01:24:45.863
I think Black folks
might be more open to that now.

2018
01:24:45.906 --> 01:24:48.300
as they-- than maybe
they would have been

2019
01:24:48.344 --> 01:24:50.694
ten or 15 or 20 years ago.

2020
01:24:50.737 --> 01:24:53.566
No. like.
we all want to like each other.

2021
01:24:53.610 --> 01:24:56.308
It's easier
to like other people.

2022
01:24:56.352 --> 01:24:59.572
It's tiring to dislike.
it's tiring to be-- to be angry.

2023
01:24:59.616 --> 01:25:01.183
so you could
show them opportunities

2024
01:25:01.226 --> 01:25:03.010
to laugh at each other.

2025
01:25:03.054 --> 01:25:05.448
So. that might be something.

2026
01:25:05.491 --> 01:25:07.014
I don't wanna speak
for all Black people.

2027
01:25:07.058 --> 01:25:08.538
I can hardly speak for myself.

2028
01:25:08.581 --> 01:25:10.322
Period. the end.

2029
01:25:10.366 --> 01:25:11.976
-I'm done.
-[interviewer] Yeah. yeah.

2030
01:25:12.019 --> 01:25:13.804
I've had it with you
and your interview.

2031
01:25:13.847 --> 01:25:15.197
-[interviewer] Yeah.
-Oh. my God. I'm not done yet!

2032
01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:17.373
He's trying to make me leave!

2033
01:25:21.246 --> 01:25:22.726
You get the point.

2034
01:25:22.769 --> 01:25:24.031
Got some funny people
in Chicago.

2035
01:25:24.075 --> 01:25:25.337
Had no ending to that.

2036
01:25:25.859 --> 01:25:26.947
