00:03:21.134 --> 00:03:22.803
Yeah. Don't think
about the furniture.

50
00:03:22.836 --> 00:03:24.672
Just close your eyes
and think of the fact

51
00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:26.139
that you're in
a beautiful castle

52
00:03:26.173 --> 00:03:28.976
with lots of beautiful.
opulent furniture.

53
00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:32.313
Yes. 'cause today. we didn't
have a good budget for this.

54
00:03:32.346 --> 00:03:34.282
-you know?
-

55
00:03:34.315 --> 00:03:35.783
But we're gonna relax.

56
00:03:35.816 --> 00:03:37.785
You know. because I'm asking
you all to relax.

57
00:03:37.818 --> 00:03:38.986
I need to be relaxed too.

58
00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.621

with his fetish.

00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:25.499

95
00:05:00.568 --> 00:05:01.702
"Oh-oh-ho!"

96
00:05:01.735 --> 00:05:03.404
and all of you
are probably saying like...

97
00:05:03.437 --> 00:05:06.239
The Caucasians are like.
"Oh. my gosh.
I didn't get that." But...

98
00:05:06.273 --> 00:05:08.376
"Oh-oh-ho" in my culture.
when we say. "My people."

99
00:05:08.376 --> 00:05:10.243
and you say. "Oh-oh-ho."
it means like. it's like.

100
00:05:10.277 --> 00:05:12.380
"Hey. what's up?" And you're
like. "Bitch. what's the tea?"

101
00:05:12.413 --> 00:05:14.382
You know what I'm saying?
Sir. do you understand.
straight man?

102
00:05:14.415 --> 00:05:16.717
You understand what I'm saying?
I don't know
if you're straight or not.

103
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.652
I don't know what you're giving.

104
00:05:18.686 --> 00:05:21.221

114
00:05:44.812 --> 00:05:46.514
Uh-huh. and some of you
would know me

115
00:05:46.547 --> 00:05:49.783
from a very little television
show called RuPaul's Drag Race.

116
00:05:49.817 --> 00:05:51.419
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

Go ahead. You can go ahead.

00:06:04.432 --> 00:06:05.833
Try it. it does wonders.

123
00:06:05.866 --> 00:06:07.000
It's amazing.

124
00:06:07.034 --> 00:06:08.436
But guess what?

125
00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:11.171

'cause you're here

00:06:16.877 --> 00:06:18.178
but they'll be beautiful.

130
00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:20.013
Yes. they will
definitely be beautiful.

131
00:06:20.047 --> 00:06:21.348
But yes. but that's not all.

132
00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:23.517
That's a part of my. you know...

133
00:06:23.551 --> 00:06:25.318
My name is BeBe.
Okay. that's great.

134
00:06:25.352 --> 00:06:28.489
But I'm also from West Africa.

135
00:06:28.522 --> 00:06:30.958
Precisely. Cameroon.
That's where I was born.

136
00:06:33.026 --> 00:06:36.464
I see you shaking your head
like you know where Cameroon is.

137
00:06:36.497 --> 00:06:38.365
-Bitch. you don't know
where Cameroon is.
-

138
00:06:38.466 --> 00:06:39.800
Bitch. you don't know
where it is.

139
00:06:39.833 --> 00:06:41.334
You think
it's some exotic island.

140
00:06:41.368 --> 00:06:44.204
Bitch. you do not know
where Cameroon is.

141
00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:45.539
and I just have to say this.

142
00:06:45.573 --> 00:06:47.374
you know. because
I just have to say this

143
00:06:47.475 --> 00:06:48.542
to every single one of you

144
00:06:48.576 --> 00:06:50.544
'cause it's. like.
it's been bothering me

145
00:06:57.551 --> 00:06:59.987
Bitch. that's hard to feel
sometimes with the bother.

146
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.321
You know what I'm saying?

147
00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:05.493
People. did you know
that Africa is a continent

148
00:07:05.526 --> 00:07:08.496
-and Cameroon is a country?
-AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Yes!

149
00:07:08.496 --> 00:07:10.498
-Bitch. you did not.

150
00:07:10.531 --> 00:07:12.766
No. you did not.
No. no. no. no. no.

151
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.502
Africa is a... Word?

152
00:07:14.535 --> 00:07:16.103
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Continent!

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:20.240
Straight men in the back.

many countries.

157
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.745
And Cameroon. one country.

158
00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:25.813
Do you understand?

159
00:07:25.846 --> 00:07:28.281
I'm so tired of people
always asking me

160
00:07:28.315 --> 00:07:30.518
where Cameroon is.
Like. "Oh..."

161
00:07:30.551 --> 00:07:32.085
I remember this one incident
when I was.

162
00:07:32.119 --> 00:07:34.622
you know. I went to an event
and was dressed to the nines.

163
00:07:34.655 --> 00:07:37.024
bitch. I was looking
really. really good.
I was looking stunning.

164
00:07:37.057 --> 00:07:39.527
You know. you always
want to pull a look. bitch.

165
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.794
and make an entrance.

166
00:07:40.828 --> 00:07:43.330
You know what I'm saying?
Make an entrance.

167
00:07:43.897 --> 00:07:45.098
I was in there.

168
00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:50.203
I mean. I was just having
such a good time.

169
00:07:50.237 --> 00:07:52.205
And then I see this lady.
straight men. yes.

170
00:07:52.239 --> 00:07:55.543
I see him... I see her walking.
She was coming close to me.

171
00:07:55.543 --> 00:07:57.044
I thought.
"Oh. bitch. she looks good."

172
00:07:57.077 --> 00:08:00.013
She had a three-piece suit on.
looking absolutely stunning.

173
00:08:00.047 --> 00:08:03.350
Her colors. you know. she was...
You know. this rollers.

174
00:08:03.383 --> 00:08:04.918
yes. holding her little purse.
you know.

175
00:08:04.952 --> 00:08:06.787
And she was a Caucasian woman.
of course.

176
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.356
She was giving you
very Hillary Clinton money.

177
00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:11.559
so you could tell
she was a rich white woman. Yes!

178
00:08:11.592 --> 00:08:13.561
So I was just sitting there.
so she comes up to me

179
00:08:13.594 --> 00:08:15.596
and she's like. "Oh. my gosh.
you look so amazing.

180
00:08:15.629 --> 00:08:17.731
"You look stunning." I'm like.
"Oh. my gosh. thank you."

181
00:08:17.765 --> 00:08:19.266
She's like.
"Where are you from?"

182
00:08:19.299 --> 00:08:23.637
I said. "I am from West Africa.
precisely. Cameroon."

183
00:08:23.671 --> 00:08:26.306
She's like. "Oh. Africa!

184
00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:29.276
"I have a friend. Mohammed.
from Senegal.

185
00:08:29.309 --> 00:08:30.611
"You must know him."

186
00:08:34.948 --> 00:08:37.785
"Bitch. I don't know no Mohammed
from Senegal."

187
00:08:37.818 --> 00:08:40.120
How many people here
have a friend named Mohammed

188
00:08:40.153 --> 00:08:42.590
or Mohammed as a common...
Just raise your hands.

189
00:08:42.623 --> 00:08:45.659
"Yes. bitch. I don't know your
friend Mohammed from Senegal.

190
00:08:45.693 --> 00:08:48.495
"I don't. And while we're at it.
I'm just gonna tell you. bitch.

191
00:08:48.596 --> 00:08:50.430
"I do not know Kunta Kinte.

192
00:08:50.463 --> 00:08:52.332
"I do not know Toby
from the Roots.

193
00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:54.935
"I don't know Rafiki
from The Lion Queen.

194
00:08:54.968 --> 00:08:56.637
"I do not know Zamunda.

195
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.339
"And I definitely. definitely
do not know Wakanda.

196
00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:02.610
"Bitch. I don't. Don't ask me
about these places. like...

197
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.245
from Senegal."

198
00:09:07.414 --> 00:09:09.516
And you know
why I know it's Simba.

199
00:09:09.617 --> 00:09:11.719
It's such a tragedy
what happened to Simba.

200
00:09:11.752 --> 00:09:13.153
and the father.

201
00:09:13.186 --> 00:09:14.688
You know what I mean?
You know what happened to Simba.

202
00:09:14.722 --> 00:09:17.190
I wonder what he's doing
these days.

203
00:09:17.224 --> 00:09:20.060
Do you know what Simba is doing?
Do you even know Simba?

204
00:09:20.093 --> 00:09:21.862
Oh. American. you know.

205
00:09:23.631 --> 00:09:24.898
Yes. I got to say that.

206
00:09:24.932 --> 00:09:27.067
And then. you know.
I don't understand

207
00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.402
why a lot of times

208
00:09:29.436 --> 00:09:32.539
when Americans
think of us Africans.

209
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.975
they think of
National Geographic.

210
00:09:36.877 --> 00:09:37.911
Uh... Right.

211
00:09:37.945 --> 00:09:39.747
I don't get it.
You know what I mean?

212
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.549
Bitch. we are not just
sitting in mud houses

213
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:44.652
with bones in our nostrils.

214
00:09:44.652 --> 00:09:46.219
hunting lions
and talking to them.

215
00:09:46.253 --> 00:09:47.855
like. "Hey. bitch.
what's going on?" "Hey. girl."

216
00:09:47.888 --> 00:09:49.890
You know.
we don't talk to our animals.

217
00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:51.725
Do you guys here
talk to your pets?

218
00:09:51.759 --> 00:09:53.160
Yes. you do. Yes. you do.

219
00:09:54.662 --> 00:09:56.864
Yes. you do. Very strange.

220
00:09:56.897 --> 00:09:58.666
Very... That's something.
It's very stra...

221
00:09:58.666 --> 00:10:00.634
That's very strange!

222
00:10:00.668 --> 00:10:01.802
Bitch. very strange.

223
00:10:01.835 --> 00:10:03.971
I must... I must admit. honey.

224
00:10:04.004 --> 00:10:05.739
That's very strange.
because I remember.

225
00:10:05.773 --> 00:10:07.741
I'm. like. sitting
in my apartment. you know.

226
00:10:07.775 --> 00:10:09.209
I'll be sitting in my apartment

227
00:10:09.242 --> 00:10:11.078
and. you know. I live
in a beautiful apartment.

228
00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:13.714
at least I make a little money.
So the apartment is beautiful.

229
00:10:13.747 --> 00:10:15.716
and then
it has a little balcony. okay?

230
00:10:15.749 --> 00:10:17.718
So then there's always
this white lady...

231
00:10:17.751 --> 00:10:19.787
You know. it's always white.
Sorry. I have to let you know
what the race is.

232
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.488
so you can really picture.

233
00:10:23.691 --> 00:10:25.225
And she's walking around.

234
00:10:25.258 --> 00:10:27.728
every time
she's with her stroller.
always walking around.

235
00:10:27.761 --> 00:10:29.496
just. like. in front of
our apartment.

236
00:10:29.529 --> 00:10:31.298
And then she's gonna wave.
I'm like. "Hey. bitch.
what's going on?"

237
00:10:31.331 --> 00:10:33.834
And so. she's walking
and then she comes back

238
00:10:33.867 --> 00:10:35.736
and forth and back and forth.
and always...

239
00:10:35.769 --> 00:10:37.905
So I thought it was like
a kid in the stroller.

240
00:10:37.938 --> 00:10:40.007
You know that.
"Oh. Mommy dearest." Very that.

241
00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.010
So then I said...
One day I was like. "Let me
just go up to the store.

242
00:10:43.043 --> 00:10:45.746
"It's a beautiful afternoon.
Let me just go up to the store."

243
00:10:45.779 --> 00:10:47.080
So. bitch.
I'm going up to the store

244
00:10:47.114 --> 00:10:48.916
and she's coming down
with that stroller.

245
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:50.483
So I was like.
"Hey. how are you?"

246
00:10:50.517 --> 00:10:51.685
You know. trying to be
a good neighbor.

247
00:10:51.719 --> 00:10:53.453
So I said.
"Hey. girl. how are you?

248
00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:54.822
"Oh. my gosh. your child.

249
00:10:54.855 --> 00:10:58.158
"I know it's so hot outside.
It's like 90 degrees.

250
00:10:58.191 --> 00:10:59.659
"What's her name?"

251
00:10:59.693 --> 00:11:02.763
And then she tells me the name
of the child is Ting-Ting.

252
00:11:02.796 --> 00:11:05.999
I said. "Oh. Ting-Ting."
Mind you. I haven't seen
what's in the stroller.

253
00:11:06.033 --> 00:11:08.368
-I was like...
-

254
00:11:09.602 --> 00:11:11.772
Oh. bitch. So I was like.
"Oh. hi. Ting-Ting."

255
00:11:11.805 --> 00:11:13.941
You know. you're always
trying to make like
you love the kid. honey.

256
00:11:13.974 --> 00:11:15.608
You cannot just be like...

257
00:11:15.642 --> 00:11:17.244
"Hi. Ting-Ting."

258
00:11:17.277 --> 00:11:18.746
So. she opened...

259
00:11:22.282 --> 00:11:23.616
...the stroller.

260
00:11:27.921 --> 00:11:29.622
Bitch. it was a rabbit.

261
00:11:31.792 --> 00:11:34.127
Bitch. I kid you not.
I'm not lying.

262
00:11:34.795 --> 00:11:36.063
It was a rabbit.

263
00:11:36.096 --> 00:11:38.766
Rabbit's name is Ting-Ting
in a stroller.

264
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.769
Can you picture that?

265
00:11:42.569 --> 00:11:44.772
You all are strange here.

266
00:11:44.772 --> 00:11:46.539
I mean. I'm not judging.
I'm not judging.

267
00:11:46.573 --> 00:11:49.777
You would speak to your pets
and Ting-Ting the rabbit.

268
00:11:49.777 --> 00:11:51.945
But you're strange.
You're strange.

269
00:11:51.979 --> 00:11:55.582
Yeah. but... And while
we are at this... This topic.

270
00:11:55.615 --> 00:11:57.650
sir. can you just tell me...

271
00:11:58.786 --> 00:12:00.253
What's your name. sir?

272
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:06.026
It's like one of those. like.
normal names. like Mohammed.

273
00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:07.494
You know what I'm saying.

274
00:12:07.527 --> 00:12:08.862
You just don't really...

275
00:12:08.896 --> 00:12:10.798
It doesn't stick out that much.

276
00:12:10.831 --> 00:12:13.033
You know what I'm say...

277
00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.844
Kevin is like. "Bitch.
what did I sign up for. honey?

278
00:12:23.877 --> 00:12:25.345
"Bitch. what did I sign up for?"

279
00:12:25.378 --> 00:12:28.315
But you know what?
Kevin. can you tell me

280
00:12:28.348 --> 00:12:31.318
who has always
told you Americans

281
00:12:31.351 --> 00:12:33.686
that 25 cents a day

282
00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.057
could keep an African child
from being hungry?

283
00:12:38.558 --> 00:12:39.927
Who. Kevin?

284
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.563
Bitch. you can't even get
a Happy Meal for 25 cents.

285
00:12:44.064 --> 00:12:45.833
Oh. the media. bitch.

286
00:12:45.833 --> 00:12:47.167
What did the...

287
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.869
The... Why the lie...
Right.

288
00:12:48.902 --> 00:12:50.503
25 cents a day. bitch.

289
00:12:50.537 --> 00:12:51.872
No.

290
00:12:51.905 --> 00:12:54.107
Girl... And by the way. just...
All you know right now

291
00:12:54.141 --> 00:12:56.509
in Africa.
we have food and water.

292
00:12:56.543 --> 00:12:58.678
Okay. bitch. And food and water.

293
00:12:58.711 --> 00:13:00.580
You can make some noise
for that. Yeah.

294
00:13:04.051 --> 00:13:06.286
And Africa is very beautiful.
I must let you know.

295
00:13:06.319 --> 00:13:08.521
Africa is beautiful.
It's just like Houston. Texas

296
00:13:08.555 --> 00:13:11.859
minus the racism
and Confederate flags. bitch.

297
00:13:11.859 --> 00:13:14.694
It's... You're...
Oh. was that too much?

298
00:13:15.963 --> 00:13:17.865
I'm just telling you
the truth. you know.

299
00:13:17.865 --> 00:13:20.500
Just from the eyes
of an African. honey.

300
00:13:20.533 --> 00:13:22.369
Just saying. Hey.

301
00:13:22.402 --> 00:13:23.536
ALL: Hey.

302
00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:25.538
What were you saying?
What did you say?

303
00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:29.109
Kevin. you've been to Africa?
What part?

304
00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:31.178
It's like... There are
many countries. honey.

305
00:13:31.211 --> 00:13:34.447
-Botswana and Senegal.
-Oh. Oh. so you know Mohammed.

306
00:13:35.983 --> 00:13:37.885
So you know Mohammed.

307
00:13:37.885 --> 00:13:40.020
You must know Mohammed. Kevin.

308
00:13:40.988 --> 00:13:42.189
You must!

309
00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:44.992
Know... Mohammed.

310
00:13:48.896 --> 00:13:51.198
You know.
I just have to say. you know.

311
00:13:51.231 --> 00:13:53.901
when I look at my journey.

312
00:13:53.901 --> 00:13:56.069
I came here about 20 years ago.

313
00:13:56.103 --> 00:13:58.405
I was just barely
an infant. honey...

314
00:14:00.908 --> 00:14:01.975
Why are you laughing?

315
00:14:03.243 --> 00:14:05.645
What's funny? I know
you've gone to Wikipedia

316
00:14:05.678 --> 00:14:07.948
and googled to try to see
what my age is.

317
00:14:07.981 --> 00:14:09.749
but bitch. it lies. okay?

318
00:14:10.817 --> 00:14:12.652
But. you know.
when I came here...

319
00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:13.720
Not when I came here

320
00:14:13.753 --> 00:14:15.055
but when I was thinking
of coming here

321
00:14:15.088 --> 00:14:17.257
because my parents announced
to me back at home.

322
00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:19.826
they were like. "Oh. BeBe.
we're gonna send you to America.

323
00:14:19.927 --> 00:14:22.795
"so you can. you know.
get your studies or whatever."

324
00:14:22.829 --> 00:14:24.264
Bitch. I was very excited.

325
00:14:24.297 --> 00:14:27.500
I was like. "Oh. my gosh.
the American dream. honey."

326
00:14:27.534 --> 00:14:30.170
I was like.
"Ooh. the high rises.

327
00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:32.005
"Bitch. you know. furs.

328
00:14:32.039 --> 00:14:33.974
"you know.
I'm gonna satisfy myself.

329
00:14:34.007 --> 00:14:36.109
"I'm gonna look like
this white Caucasian woman.

330
00:14:36.143 --> 00:14:37.777
"you know. just very rich."

331
00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:39.312
I was thinking of Hollywood.

332
00:14:39.346 --> 00:14:41.949
I was... Oh. bitch. I was
looking at the brochure. girl.

333
00:14:41.949 --> 00:14:44.985
it was like paradise.

334
00:14:45.018 --> 00:14:47.955
Oh. bitch.
I said "brochure." girl.

335
00:14:47.988 --> 00:14:50.991
Bitch. I said "brochure." honey.

336
00:14:51.024 --> 00:14:53.961
Yes. very that.
Everybody say. "Brochure."

337
00:14:53.994 --> 00:14:55.162
ALL: Brochure!

338
00:14:55.195 --> 00:14:57.264
Now. what. honey?

339
00:14:57.297 --> 00:14:59.799
But. bitch.
I was looking at a brochure.

340
00:14:59.832 --> 00:15:02.335
it was very. like.
paradise here on Earth.

341
00:15:02.369 --> 00:15:06.773
I was like. "Oh. my God. bitch.
I'm going to America!"

342
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:13.380
Why did I land

343
00:15:13.413 --> 00:15:16.883
and my final destination
was Minnesota?

344
00:15:19.987 --> 00:15:22.255
Bitch. it was minus 2 degrees

345
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.392
and they had a blizzard.

346
00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:27.194
Bitch. I looked at the brochure.

347
00:15:27.227 --> 00:15:30.763
I looked out the window.
I said. "Oh. hell no!

348
00:15:31.498 --> 00:15:33.333
"This must be the layover."

349
00:15:34.401 --> 00:15:36.069
I said.
"This must be the layover."

350
00:15:36.103 --> 00:15:39.006
Yeah. because bitch. this is not
what the brochure was saying.

351
00:15:39.006 --> 00:15:41.041
This is not what the brochure
was saying. you know?

352
00:15:41.074 --> 00:15:43.410
Right. sis?

353
00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:44.577
Do you know what I'm talking?

354
00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:45.912
How many people
have been to Minnesota?

355
00:15:46.013 --> 00:15:47.414
-MAN: Yes!
-

356
00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:49.816
How many of you have been
to Minnesota in the winter?

357
00:15:52.119 --> 00:15:53.786
So the brochure lied.

358
00:15:55.022 --> 00:15:56.289
Did it lie. girl?

359
00:15:56.323 --> 00:15:57.924
Yeah. I said. not tonight.

360
00:15:58.025 --> 00:16:00.660
It's like what you ordered
and what you received.

361
00:16:00.693 --> 00:16:03.296
I said no. But. you know.
you kind of make it work.

362
00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:04.631
You know.
you kind of make it work.

363
00:16:04.664 --> 00:16:06.033
And so. I came here to America.

364
00:16:06.033 --> 00:16:08.035
Finally. I'm in America.
No matter where I am.

365
00:16:08.068 --> 00:16:10.403
I am here in America.
I have made it.

366
00:16:10.437 --> 00:16:12.705
And you all can make some noise
for me being here.

367
00:16:19.746 --> 00:16:20.580
She made it.

368
00:16:20.613 --> 00:16:22.882
But you know. when I got here...

369
00:16:28.421 --> 00:16:31.891
Bitch. when I got here
in Minnesota.

370
00:16:31.924 --> 00:16:34.361
not like... Well. America.
Same thing.

371
00:16:35.428 --> 00:16:37.064
But still. they were...
My friends were like.

372
00:16:37.064 --> 00:16:38.898
"Okay. let's go out
and let's go have food. BeBe."

373
00:16:38.931 --> 00:16:41.168
You know. mind you.
I've been here for a little bit.

374
00:16:41.201 --> 00:16:42.369
you know. a little while.

375
00:16:42.402 --> 00:16:43.536
But you know. sometimes
when you come here.

376
00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:45.072
there's always like that
culture shock.

377
00:16:45.072 --> 00:16:47.540
And the first culture shock
was. of course. the winter

378
00:16:47.574 --> 00:16:50.110
which I kind of. like. started
getting myself used to it.

379
00:16:50.143 --> 00:16:52.212
But okay. the restaurant...
I've never really gone
to a restaurant.

380
00:16:52.245 --> 00:16:54.714
So I said. "Okay.
let's go to a restaurant."

381
00:16:54.747 --> 00:16:58.385
So we go and we are sitting
at the restaurant.

382
00:16:58.418 --> 00:17:00.587
And now I'm trying to be
very. very inquisitive

383
00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.122
and just looking around.

384
00:17:02.155 --> 00:17:06.126
And one thing I noticed
on every table

385
00:17:06.159 --> 00:17:07.994
was salt and pepper.

386
00:17:08.095 --> 00:17:09.696
Like. every table
had salt and pepper.

387
00:17:09.729 --> 00:17:11.098
So I didn't really understand.
I was like.

388
00:17:11.131 --> 00:17:13.200
"Maybe that's how
the Americans do it."

389
00:17:13.233 --> 00:17:15.535
And then. all of a sudden.
the waiter comes

390
00:17:15.568 --> 00:17:17.970
and brings us the menu.

391
00:17:18.004 --> 00:17:20.207
And all the menus
look like a phone book

392
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.643
with. like. so many pages.

393
00:17:25.112 --> 00:17:27.147
I felt like I was
holding my dissertation.

394
00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:29.849
I mean. it really...
Bitch. it really did.

395
00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:31.551
And then
he's standing right there

396
00:17:31.584 --> 00:17:34.954
and. like. it seems like
there was this imaginary
time clock saying.

397
00:17:34.987 --> 00:17:37.190
"Bitch. you better order
really fast.

398
00:17:37.224 --> 00:17:38.525
"Hurry. hurry. hurry. hurry."

399
00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:40.993
Girl. I swear I could hear
the music of Joe Purdy

400
00:17:41.027 --> 00:17:43.463
just playing.
just playing. And...

401
00:17:43.496 --> 00:17:45.832
So I have to go through
all of this dissertation.

402
00:17:45.865 --> 00:17:47.800
which is "AKA" the menu. bitch.

403
00:17:47.834 --> 00:17:50.137
So when I'm done. I'm going to
have high blood pressure

404
00:17:50.137 --> 00:17:52.172
and I'm going to have
an anxiety complex.

405
00:17:52.205 --> 00:17:53.005
But I said...

406
00:17:57.177 --> 00:18:00.012
"The Yelp review
never gave all of that."

407
00:18:00.046 --> 00:18:03.150
Lied again. like the brochure.
You know what I'm saying?

408
00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:04.617
So then the food comes out.

409
00:18:04.651 --> 00:18:06.219
The food comes out
looking stunning.

410
00:18:06.253 --> 00:18:09.256
You Americans know
how to sell the illusion. bitch.

411
00:18:10.457 --> 00:18:12.325
Bitch. when it comes
to the presentation.

412
00:18:12.359 --> 00:18:14.994
y'all know how to present!

413
00:18:16.763 --> 00:18:17.897
The food comes out...

414
00:18:19.199 --> 00:18:22.735
Just laid on the table.
Just spread. bitch.

415
00:18:22.769 --> 00:18:28.007
Now I understood why
the table had salt and pepper.

416
00:18:30.277 --> 00:18:35.014
Americans. what is up
with your unseasoned food?

417
00:18:36.316 --> 00:18:37.817
Where is the flavor?

418
00:18:38.485 --> 00:18:41.087
Bitch. where is the flavor?

419
00:18:41.188 --> 00:18:44.191
Bitch. I know if my sister or
my auntie was sitting with me.

420
00:18:44.224 --> 00:18:46.659
they should have been like.

421
00:18:46.693 --> 00:18:49.196
"BeBe. I cannot say...
Why...

422
00:18:49.196 --> 00:18:51.764
"Why this people's food
tasting like that now. heh?"

423
00:18:51.798 --> 00:18:54.201
"Where is the Maggi and the salt
and pepper and the onions

424
00:18:54.234 --> 00:18:57.370
"and all the things... I just...
Where is the Aqaba. heh?"

425
00:18:57.404 --> 00:19:00.207
Girl. I could just see
my auntie just saying that.
you know?

426
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.908
But I have to use this moment

427
00:19:01.941 --> 00:19:03.276
to really apologize

428
00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:05.245
to all of my girlfriends.

429
00:19:05.278 --> 00:19:07.747
because every time
we went to a restaurant.

430
00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:09.282
they will hold this. like.

431
00:19:09.316 --> 00:19:10.950
designer bags.
you know what I mean?

432
00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:12.385
And they'll go to the restaurant

433
00:19:12.419 --> 00:19:14.887
and when we go to the restaurant
and the food comes out

434
00:19:14.921 --> 00:19:16.589
and that bag opens.

435
00:19:16.623 --> 00:19:18.791
there's a whole bunch of spices
coming out.

436
00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.795
And I used to talk
to my girls. I said.

437
00:19:22.829 --> 00:19:24.764
"Bitch. this is so embarrassing.

438
00:19:24.797 --> 00:19:26.366
"What are these people
thinking of us?"

439
00:19:26.399 --> 00:19:29.702
Mind you that we're Black girls.
I love you sisters. you know.

440
00:19:29.736 --> 00:19:31.304
I mean. if I'm gonna
call the white girls.

441
00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:32.805
I gotta call
the Black girls. so...

442
00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:35.275
It was us. honey.
just pulling out all the spices.

443
00:19:35.308 --> 00:19:36.709
and I just had to say...

444
00:19:36.743 --> 00:19:38.778
But now it made sense
because when they pulled out.

445
00:19:38.811 --> 00:19:40.747
it was a lot...
It wasn't like a lottery.

446
00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:41.948
It was a necessity.

447
00:19:41.981 --> 00:19:43.783
Like. you needed those spices.

448
00:19:43.816 --> 00:19:47.086
And I know you Americans
know what I'm talking about.
about the flavor.

449
00:19:47.119 --> 00:19:49.789
Make some noise if you know what
I'm talking about the flavor.

450
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:52.392
So. Kevin.
do you know what I did?

451
00:19:52.425 --> 00:19:55.895
As a matter of fact. I brought
my purse today. honey.

452
00:19:55.928 --> 00:19:57.430
Yes. Oh. yes. I did.

453
00:19:57.464 --> 00:20:00.166
You know. because every time
I've been going ever since then.

454
00:20:00.267 --> 00:20:01.234
I carry my purse.

455
00:20:01.268 --> 00:20:03.336
And tonight.
I had to bring my purse

456
00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:04.504
because I wasn't so sure

457
00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:06.239
what you audiences will give me.

458
00:20:06.273 --> 00:20:08.074
I don't know
if you'll be salt and pepper

459
00:20:08.107 --> 00:20:10.009
or if I would need to season
y'all bitches.

460
00:20:10.042 --> 00:20:12.612
So I brought...
Let's see what I have here.

461
00:20:12.645 --> 00:20:13.813
Hmm.

462
00:20:16.182 --> 00:20:18.618
Oh. bitch.
I have my black pepper. Mmhmm.

463
00:20:18.651 --> 00:20:20.152
-MAN: Yay!
-Mmhmm.

464
00:20:20.186 --> 00:20:21.954
Let me see. I have my...

465
00:20:21.988 --> 00:20:24.324
Oh. my Baileys. Mmhmm.

466
00:20:25.157 --> 00:20:26.359
Mmhmm.

467
00:20:26.393 --> 00:20:29.596
What do I have?
I have my sesame seed. bitch.

468
00:20:29.629 --> 00:20:31.130
Mmhmm.

469
00:20:31.163 --> 00:20:35.668
I have the sesame seed. bitch.
I have my hot sauce. bitch.

470
00:20:35.702 --> 00:20:38.971
Bitch. I have my paprika. bitch.

471
00:20:39.005 --> 00:20:40.440
Bitch. I got my paprika. bitch.

472
00:20:40.473 --> 00:20:42.208
What do I have? My five spice.

473
00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:44.844
Yeah. that...
That is a good one. bitch.

474
00:20:44.877 --> 00:20:47.046
It's just a good one.
You need to try it. uh-huh.

475
00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:48.981
It's a good...
And then. ah. yes.

476
00:20:49.015 --> 00:20:51.351
And my sumac here.
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

477
00:20:51.384 --> 00:20:54.053
Oh. bitch. oh... Oh!
And I brought some sprays.

478
00:20:55.822 --> 00:20:57.189
I brought
my pepper spray. bitch?

479
00:20:58.658 --> 00:20:59.959
Oh. yes. bitch. I hear that.

480
00:20:59.992 --> 00:21:02.228
You know. if anybody
tries to act cute. honey.

481
00:21:02.329 --> 00:21:04.564
I'm gonna use my pepper spray
because... Oh. yes. bitch.

482
00:21:04.597 --> 00:21:07.133
I'm not doing it. honey.
I could be tall and Black.

483
00:21:07.166 --> 00:21:08.968
but I'm not
Dave Chappelle. bitch.

484
00:21:09.001 --> 00:21:11.638
And bitch. Will Smith
is not about to get...

485
00:21:11.671 --> 00:21:12.972
Is Will in the house?

486
00:21:13.005 --> 00:21:16.909
Will. I got one for you.
bubba. bitch!

487
00:21:16.943 --> 00:21:20.146
If you come to me. honey.
Kevin...

488
00:21:29.856 --> 00:21:32.359
She just needs
to come prepared. honey.

489
00:21:32.359 --> 00:21:34.394
You are just looking at me
so stunned.

490
00:21:34.427 --> 00:21:37.229
I know you've never seen
this kind of beauty before.
It's a lot.

491
00:21:37.263 --> 00:21:40.066
It's a lot to. you know.
take it all in. Mmhmm.

492
00:21:40.099 --> 00:21:42.234
Mmhmm. What's your name. sir?

493
00:21:42.268 --> 00:21:44.471
-Oh. hi. Brian.
Where are you from?

494
00:21:49.208 --> 00:21:50.510
Where's that?

495
00:21:51.844 --> 00:21:52.845
Oh. okay.

496
00:21:52.879 --> 00:21:54.146
It's a country?

497
00:21:58.017 --> 00:21:59.151
Bitch on a bus.

498
00:21:59.185 --> 00:22:00.487
But you know. when I...

499
00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.755
Also. I just have to
also ask you all Americans.

500
00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:06.192
and I wanna say. I have so much
love for all of us. for you.

501
00:22:06.225 --> 00:22:08.395
But I also don't understand

502
00:22:08.395 --> 00:22:11.398
why people are so...
Americans just. in general.

503
00:22:11.398 --> 00:22:15.402
why you all
are so obsessed with accents?

504
00:22:15.402 --> 00:22:17.437
Like... Oh. they... Am I lying?

505
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:20.607
Please. make some noise if
you think I'm telling the truth.

506
00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:25.111
Yes. I was in another event.
you know.

507
00:22:25.144 --> 00:22:26.579
having a good time.
dressed to the nines.

508
00:22:26.613 --> 00:22:28.415
You know. like I say.
I always dress. honey.

509
00:22:28.448 --> 00:22:30.417
And this lady
comes through again. honey.

510
00:22:30.417 --> 00:22:32.585
Caucasian lady.
And I love you Caucasian women.

511
00:22:32.619 --> 00:22:36.423
Don't think I'm trying
to pick on you. because
you bitches pay my bills. so...

512
00:22:36.456 --> 00:22:39.258
I'm not...
You understand? I know.

513
00:22:39.291 --> 00:22:41.428
You know that purse
has a lot of...coins.

514
00:22:41.428 --> 00:22:42.962
So. but...

515
00:22:42.995 --> 00:22:45.231
It's always y'all acting very
blonde. you know what I mean?

516
00:22:45.264 --> 00:22:49.268
Like. it's like America
is full of a lot
and a lot of different cultures.

517
00:22:49.301 --> 00:22:51.771
so I just don't understand
when an immigrant comes

518
00:22:51.804 --> 00:22:55.442
and you guys act like it's some
alien from outer space.

519
00:22:55.475 --> 00:22:57.810
She comes up to me
and she's having
a conversation with me.

520
00:22:57.844 --> 00:23:00.447
and she's like. "Hey. you know.
you're dressed nice.

521
00:23:00.447 --> 00:23:02.214
"Oh. my gosh.
you look really good."

522
00:23:02.248 --> 00:23:04.684
I said. "Oh. bitch.
thank you so much.
I get this all the time."

523
00:23:06.352 --> 00:23:08.521
And she's like. "Oh."
So we started
having a conversation.

524
00:23:08.555 --> 00:23:10.523
So she asked me and she's like.
"Where are you from?"

525
00:23:10.557 --> 00:23:11.991
I said. "I'm from Cameroon.
West Africa."

526
00:23:12.024 --> 00:23:14.494
She's like.
"Oh. my gosh. your accent.

527
00:23:14.527 --> 00:23:19.198
"Oh. your accent
is so beautiful."

528
00:23:19.231 --> 00:23:21.333
I said. "Oh. bitch. here we go.

529
00:23:21.834 --> 00:23:22.969
"Here we go."

530
00:23:23.002 --> 00:23:24.671
The accent.
the stereotypes that you...

531
00:23:24.704 --> 00:23:26.539
You know. it's come
to the point where

532
00:23:26.573 --> 00:23:28.541
now every time when people ask
me. "Your accent. your accent."

533
00:23:28.575 --> 00:23:30.977
I just break down and just be
honest and I say.

534
00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:32.779
"Hey. bitch.
I'm from South Dakota.

535
00:23:34.614 --> 00:23:36.382
"It's exotic there."

536
00:23:36.483 --> 00:23:38.384
I'm just a riot. bitch.
You've got to tell...
You know what I mean?

537
00:23:38.485 --> 00:23:39.686
And by the time
they come to you and say.

538
00:23:39.719 --> 00:23:41.921
"Hey. bitch. where you...
Where are you from?

539
00:23:41.954 --> 00:23:43.322
"Oh. my gosh. you have a..."

540
00:23:43.355 --> 00:23:45.525
"Oh. you have a nice thing."
You got to catch them

541
00:23:45.558 --> 00:23:47.527
before they try to catch you.

542
00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:50.329
Okay. you're trying to tell me
that I have an accent. honey.

543
00:23:50.362 --> 00:23:52.499
What's so special
about my accent. anyways?

544
00:23:52.532 --> 00:23:53.700
Nothing so special.

545
00:23:53.733 --> 00:23:56.268
Try people from Boston
and New Orleans. honey.

546
00:23:57.804 --> 00:23:59.506
Oh. girl. anybody from Boston
and New Orleans.

547
00:23:59.506 --> 00:24:02.374
if you've heard them talk.
now that's an accent. honey.

548
00:24:03.375 --> 00:24:05.011
Isn't that an accent. honey?

549
00:24:05.044 --> 00:24:06.312
Yes. that's an accent.

550
00:24:06.345 --> 00:24:07.680
You know. sometimes
when I go to those cities.

551
00:24:07.714 --> 00:24:10.750
I have to just take my
translation dictionary with me.

552
00:24:10.783 --> 00:24:14.120
They'd be like. "Hi! Hi!"

553
00:24:14.153 --> 00:24:15.655
"Siri. what did they say?"

554
00:24:17.524 --> 00:24:19.258
But you know what?
I'll have to also say this.

555
00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:20.627
You know.
the fact that I'm African.

556
00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:23.262
and by the way. I am a very.
very proud African. sis.

557
00:24:23.295 --> 00:24:25.364
-I'm a proud one.
-

558
00:24:27.534 --> 00:24:29.669
How many... Do we have
Africans in the house?

559
00:24:29.702 --> 00:24:31.604
I'm not talking about
those from here.

560
00:24:31.638 --> 00:24:33.372
and I love you from here. bitch.

561
00:24:33.405 --> 00:24:36.375
'cause I knew
it's a lot of boats. honey.

562
00:24:36.408 --> 00:24:38.377
But Africans
that have come here.

563
00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:39.846
not through
what they've come through.

564
00:24:39.879 --> 00:24:42.549
like airplane. I need them
coming through the airplane.

565
00:24:42.582 --> 00:24:44.050
Make some noise.

566
00:24:44.083 --> 00:24:45.217
Oh. where are you from?

567
00:24:46.418 --> 00:24:47.620
Ethiopia!

568
00:24:47.654 --> 00:24:48.921
Oh. oh!

569
00:24:50.557 --> 00:24:52.959
That's a long way. bitch.

570
00:24:52.992 --> 00:24:55.394
Other... Other people
from Africa? Also Ethiopia.

571
00:24:55.427 --> 00:24:56.663
Who else do we have
in the house?

572
00:24:56.696 --> 00:24:58.565
-Oh. where are you from. sir?
-

573
00:24:58.598 --> 00:25:00.733
Oh. ooh. South Africa.

574
00:25:00.767 --> 00:25:03.603
Oh. any other Africans
in the house?

575
00:25:03.636 --> 00:25:04.637
Just two?

576
00:25:09.676 --> 00:25:11.644
Oh. you used to live
in Botswana?

577
00:25:11.678 --> 00:25:12.712
Oh. so. you think
you have a card

578
00:25:12.745 --> 00:25:14.614
because you used to live
in Botswana.

579
00:25:14.647 --> 00:25:15.748
Bitch. no. you don't.

580
00:25:15.782 --> 00:25:17.984
That don't make you
no African. bitch.

581
00:25:18.017 --> 00:25:22.655
You're just brown. honey.

582
00:25:22.689 --> 00:25:23.756
But I have to just say that

583
00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:25.758
the fact that
I am African. Kevin...

584
00:25:25.792 --> 00:25:27.259
You know. Kevin is like.
"Oh. bitch..."

585
00:25:27.293 --> 00:25:29.829
you're gonna
get used to it. but...

586
00:25:31.297 --> 00:25:33.733
The fact that I'm African
doesn't mean

587
00:25:33.766 --> 00:25:35.301
I drive a cab.

588
00:25:35.334 --> 00:25:37.604
or I know how to braid hair.

589
00:25:37.637 --> 00:25:39.739
I'm just... I just have to say
it doesn't. I'm not...

590
00:25:39.772 --> 00:25:42.408
Well. as a matter of fact.
I probably know...
I know how to braid hair

591
00:25:42.441 --> 00:25:43.643
because after
we're done tonight.

592
00:25:43.676 --> 00:25:45.244
I have to go to 125th Street

593
00:25:45.277 --> 00:25:47.614
because I have some clients
till midnight. do you get it?

594
00:25:47.614 --> 00:25:49.448
Yeah. yeah. yeah.
No. I'm just saying. sis.

595
00:25:49.481 --> 00:25:51.984
because it takes a lot to look
this cheap. You understand
what I'm saying?

596
00:25:52.018 --> 00:25:53.986
So I gotta go make my coins.
you know what I'm saying.

597
00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:56.455
because people think like.
"Oh. you won RuPaul's Drag Race
and blah. blah..."

598
00:25:56.488 --> 00:25:57.690
Bitch. I'm still broke.
you know what I mean?

599
00:25:57.724 --> 00:25:59.626
Like. one of my friends.
the other day. called me

600
00:25:59.659 --> 00:26:01.661
and she was like.
"Oh. BeBe. you need to...

601
00:26:01.694 --> 00:26:03.229
"You need to spread the wealth."

602
00:26:03.262 --> 00:26:05.064
I said. "Bitch. what do you mean
'I need to spread the wealth'?"

603
00:26:05.097 --> 00:26:07.667
Okay? She's like.
"Girl. well. I was on Google

604
00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:10.770
"and I found out your worth
is $1.5 million."

605
00:26:10.803 --> 00:26:12.739
I'm like.
"Bitch. where is the money?

606
00:26:14.641 --> 00:26:16.075
"Bitch. where's the money?

607
00:26:16.108 --> 00:26:17.644
"Because I remember
when I won RuPaul's Drag Race.

608
00:26:17.644 --> 00:26:19.345
"it was $20.000. bitch.

609
00:26:19.378 --> 00:26:21.447
"And by the time
I received my check.

610
00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.415
"the IRS had taken
half of that check.

611
00:26:23.449 --> 00:26:25.718
"They had. bitch. and then
when I wanted to cash the check.

612
00:26:25.752 --> 00:26:27.887
"I had to pay
to cash the check. Bitch.

613
00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.656
"And then I had to feed
all of Africa.

614
00:26:29.656 --> 00:26:32.058
"So. bitch. where is the money?

615
00:26:32.091 --> 00:26:34.794
"Because the wire transfer
has not cleared. bitch.

616
00:26:34.827 --> 00:26:37.029
"I'm still waiting. bitch."

617
00:26:37.063 --> 00:26:40.700
I'm telling you.
Google and Wikipedia. bitch.

618
00:26:40.733 --> 00:26:42.401
they try...
The lies they tell!

619
00:26:42.434 --> 00:26:44.470
Hi!

620
00:26:44.503 --> 00:26:45.571
What's your name. sir?

621
00:26:45.672 --> 00:26:47.139
-Oh.

622
00:26:52.679 --> 00:26:54.246
Just like Mohammed.

623
00:26:56.082 --> 00:26:58.050
Just like Mohammed.

624
00:26:58.084 --> 00:27:01.688
Just like Mohammed
from Senegal. bitch.

625
00:27:01.721 --> 00:27:04.824
So now you see how stupid
that question was. bitch.

626
00:27:05.825 --> 00:27:08.227
I'm just saying. but...

627
00:27:13.866 --> 00:27:16.168
Kevin. I'm not trying to say
anything wrong about you.

628
00:27:21.941 --> 00:27:24.744
Kevin. it's a... You're okay.
but it's a good name.

629
00:27:24.777 --> 00:27:25.978
Mmhmm.

630
00:27:28.781 --> 00:27:31.150
You know. one thing I also
noticed when I came here.

631
00:27:31.183 --> 00:27:32.719
like. one of the stereotypes
I see.

632
00:27:32.752 --> 00:27:34.553
you know. when I come here. um.

633
00:27:34.586 --> 00:27:37.724
people always tell me.
"Oh. my gosh. Africa. Africa.
Are you guys...

634
00:27:37.724 --> 00:27:39.025
"The fact that
you're from Africa.

635
00:27:39.058 --> 00:27:42.394
"that means you guys
really know how to move.

636
00:27:42.428 --> 00:27:43.896
"Like. you have rhythm."

637
00:27:45.131 --> 00:27:46.733
I said.
"Well. some of that is true.

638
00:27:46.766 --> 00:27:49.435
"but not everybody has rhythm."
you know what I mean?

639
00:27:49.468 --> 00:27:53.239
Because I feel like
the media has bamboozled you.

640
00:27:53.272 --> 00:27:57.609
that in Africa we just have
only three dance moves. Okay?

641
00:27:57.643 --> 00:27:58.945
Like. we have just a...

642
00:27:58.978 --> 00:28:01.580
Bitch. you know. and...
Any dancers in the house?

643
00:28:01.748 --> 00:28:04.784
Any... Y'all know exactly
what I'm talking about.

644
00:28:04.817 --> 00:28:06.819
You think we have just
three dance moves?

645
00:28:06.853 --> 00:28:09.621
And do you wanna know
who I really blame. honey?

646
00:28:09.655 --> 00:28:12.291
I'm not pointing at you
like you're the one I blame.

647
00:28:12.324 --> 00:28:13.860
Don't get too nervous.

648
00:28:13.893 --> 00:28:15.828
But bitch. I blame
Coming to America.

649
00:28:15.862 --> 00:28:18.597
Bitch. yes. I blame that movie
Coming to America.

650
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:20.132
They tried it. bitch.

651
00:28:20.166 --> 00:28:22.468
They tried it thinking that
we have just three dance moves.

652
00:28:22.501 --> 00:28:26.672
The only thing they got right
is the rose petals.

653
00:28:26.773 --> 00:28:29.541
Yeah. everything
is far-fetched. bitch.

654
00:28:29.575 --> 00:28:31.811
Everything is far... But if
you're a dancer in the house

655
00:28:31.844 --> 00:28:33.179
and you know
what I'm talking about.

656
00:28:33.212 --> 00:28:35.782
those three African moves.
please make some noise.

657
00:28:35.815 --> 00:28:38.484
-MAN: Yay!
-

658
00:28:40.552 --> 00:28:41.988
Uh. if I ask you
to come up here.

659
00:28:42.021 --> 00:28:43.522
can you come up here. honey?

660
00:28:47.827 --> 00:28:49.628
Come up here. honey.

661
00:29:05.311 --> 00:29:06.813
Mm.

662
00:29:06.813 --> 00:29:09.615
Wow. Wow.

663
00:29:29.435 --> 00:29:31.570
Mmhmm.

664
00:29:31.603 --> 00:29:34.506
Okay. bitch. I... What's...
What's your name. by the way?

665
00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:35.908
What's your name. sir?

666
00:29:35.942 --> 00:29:37.309
Uh. Kevin.

667
00:29:38.444 --> 00:29:42.014
Oh. bitch. you don't look
like a Kevin. honey.

668
00:29:42.048 --> 00:29:44.750
You're not giving me a Kevin.
honey. that's not an illusion.

669
00:29:44.851 --> 00:29:46.752
-What's your name. sir?
-Eddie.

670
00:29:46.853 --> 00:29:48.955
Oh. Eddie. Where are you from?

671
00:29:48.988 --> 00:29:50.189
New York. Manhattan.

672
00:29:54.861 --> 00:29:56.963
-Born and raised?
-No.

673
00:29:58.130 --> 00:29:59.866
Bitch. we need to know
the real place.

674
00:29:59.866 --> 00:30:01.433
Bitch. where are you from?

675
00:30:01.467 --> 00:30:02.534
Liberty. New York.

676
00:30:04.871 --> 00:30:06.405
Is that a country?

677
00:30:09.541 --> 00:30:12.344
I'm just saying. bitch.
is that a country?

678
00:30:12.378 --> 00:30:15.281
But listen. Eddie.
I want you to...

679
00:30:15.314 --> 00:30:18.017
How do you... By the way.
there's three dance moves
I'm talking about

680
00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:19.285
and you say you know

681
00:30:19.318 --> 00:30:20.686
-about...
-I think I know what you mean.

682
00:30:20.719 --> 00:30:25.524
You think I know. What makes
you think that you know?

683
00:30:25.557 --> 00:30:27.126
Taking dance.

684
00:30:27.159 --> 00:30:29.528
Oh. tak... Oh. because you're
a dancer and a choreographer?

685
00:30:29.561 --> 00:30:31.063
Oh. So...

686
00:30:31.097 --> 00:30:32.831
I know... I don't know
if I know you.

687
00:30:32.865 --> 00:30:34.666
and I am putting you
on the spot...

688
00:30:38.604 --> 00:30:40.873
I just wanna make sure
that you don't have
a heart attack.

689
00:30:40.907 --> 00:30:41.874
you know what I'm saying?

690
00:30:41.908 --> 00:30:43.742
Look. just trying to
make sure...

691
00:30:43.775 --> 00:30:45.878
But Kev. uh... Eddie. can you...

692
00:30:45.912 --> 00:30:47.546
Would you...
If I put some music.

693
00:30:47.579 --> 00:30:50.049
would you be able
to show the audience
the three dance moves?

694
00:30:50.082 --> 00:30:53.752
Because sometimes they look
at me as if I'm always just...

695
00:30:53.785 --> 00:30:56.288
-Do you want him...
-

696
00:30:59.225 --> 00:31:01.593
If somebody hits
some music for me. people.

697
00:31:01.627 --> 00:31:03.429
-Hit some music.
-

698
00:31:03.462 --> 00:31:05.131
Come... Come on.
make some noise.

699
00:31:05.164 --> 00:31:07.766
Ah! Ah! Come on.

700
00:31:08.434 --> 00:31:10.302
Oh! Ah!

701
00:31:10.336 --> 00:31:11.370
Eh! Eh!

702
00:31:11.938 --> 00:31:14.506
Ah! Ah! Eh!

703
00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:17.343
Eh! Eh! Eh!

704
00:31:17.977 --> 00:31:20.947
Eh! Eh! Hey. Hey!

705
00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:22.314
Ah! Ah! Oh!

706
00:31:23.015 --> 00:31:24.783
All right. all right.

707
00:31:24.816 --> 00:31:27.486
Ah. ah. ah. ah. ah!

708
00:31:27.519 --> 00:31:28.955
Ah. ah. ah!

709
00:31:28.988 --> 00:31:31.157
That's too much!
That's too much!

710
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:32.992
Too much. That's too much.

711
00:31:33.025 --> 00:31:34.626
Cut that music.

712
00:31:35.861 --> 00:31:37.997
-Uh-huh.

713
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:44.670
Uh-huh.

714
00:31:44.703 --> 00:31:46.805
Not the split. bitch.
The split...

715
00:31:46.838 --> 00:31:49.508
That wasn't... That wasn't
part of the routine. bitch.

716
00:31:49.541 --> 00:31:51.978
Not this. The other three.
you've got the other three.

717
00:31:52.011 --> 00:31:54.713
Yeah. you got the other three
but not the split but you did...

718
00:31:54.746 --> 00:31:56.882
Everybody. please
make some noise for him.

719
00:32:03.255 --> 00:32:05.891
You put all those three moves
together. honey.

720
00:32:05.992 --> 00:32:09.295
and you have
the African tribal dance.

721
00:32:09.328 --> 00:32:11.998
And it's so interesting
because all the way up to today.

722
00:32:11.998 --> 00:32:16.235
those are the three moves
that they're still teaching all
you bitches in class. honey.

723
00:32:17.103 --> 00:32:18.470
Kevin...

724
00:32:18.504 --> 00:32:21.407
Africa. Many countries.

725
00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:24.410
Okay? Many countries.

726
00:32:26.178 --> 00:32:30.716
But. you know.
after being here in America.

727
00:32:30.749 --> 00:32:33.652
some things
feel very normal. sis.

728
00:32:33.685 --> 00:32:35.254
You know. some things
feel very normal.

729
00:32:35.287 --> 00:32:36.822
like. sometimes
it felt like home.

730
00:32:36.855 --> 00:32:38.257
And I'm gonna
tell you this incident.

731
00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:40.559
One of the things that
I kind of see the similarities

732
00:32:40.592 --> 00:32:43.729
between America and Africa

733
00:32:43.762 --> 00:32:44.930
are the aunties.

734
00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:50.669
The gossips. bitch.

735
00:32:50.702 --> 00:32:53.039
Oh. you're like... Oh. you don't
know who the aunties are?

736
00:32:53.039 --> 00:32:57.309
If you don't know
who the aunties are.
then you are the auntie.

737
00:32:57.343 --> 00:33:01.047
Bitch. you know what I mean?
Okay. how many people know
when I say the aunties?

738
00:33:01.047 --> 00:33:03.915
-How many people know
what I'm talking about?
-

739
00:33:05.617 --> 00:33:08.054
Exactly. So. you know. I was
minding my own business.

740
00:33:08.087 --> 00:33:10.222
I was just sitting. you know.
It was a beautiful day.

741
00:33:10.256 --> 00:33:12.058
You know. I always have
to paint the scenery

742
00:33:12.058 --> 00:33:14.060
so you guys can actually know
what was going on. bitch.

743
00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:15.827
I cannot just tell the story.
you know what I mean. bitch?

744
00:33:15.861 --> 00:33:19.398
You've got to paint...
So it was a beautiful day.
you know.

745
00:33:21.867 --> 00:33:23.202
Sis. it was
a beautiful day. bitch.

746
00:33:23.235 --> 00:33:24.936
I would say
probably like 80 degrees.

747
00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:26.605
You know. nice. sunny. whatever.

748
00:33:26.638 --> 00:33:29.541
And I was just like...
I came and I was sitting
by two aunties.

749
00:33:29.575 --> 00:33:31.910
They were just sitting there.
And I was like. "Hey."

750
00:33:31.943 --> 00:33:35.081
We're just having
a very nice. polite.

751
00:33:35.114 --> 00:33:36.082
intelligent conversation.

752
00:33:36.115 --> 00:33:38.084
I know they have
lived in America

753
00:33:38.084 --> 00:33:39.251
for such a long time.

754
00:33:39.285 --> 00:33:40.919
but they were actually
from Africa.

755
00:33:40.952 --> 00:33:43.089
So. you know. we're like.
"Auntie. how are you?"

756
00:33:43.122 --> 00:33:46.092
"Oh. good to see you.
You're looking so good."
or whatever.

757
00:33:46.125 --> 00:33:48.427
And then all of a sudden.
this beautiful young girl.

758
00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:50.696
I would say she's probably
like 25 years old.

759
00:33:50.729 --> 00:33:53.532
So she had a little mini skirt
on. her little crop top.

760
00:33:53.565 --> 00:33:54.933
you know. long hair.

761
00:33:54.966 --> 00:33:56.935
She was giving you the fantasy
just like a teenager.

762
00:33:56.968 --> 00:33:58.137
And I'm like...
Well. she's not a teenager

763
00:33:58.170 --> 00:33:59.371
'cause she was
20-something years old.

764
00:33:59.405 --> 00:34:00.872
But you understand.
she was young.

765
00:34:00.906 --> 00:34:02.708
So she's walking through
and she's coming through.

766
00:34:02.741 --> 00:34:04.510
and she comes
by the aunties. right?

767
00:34:04.543 --> 00:34:06.278
Her name is Amina.

768
00:34:06.312 --> 00:34:07.446
Everybody say "Amina."

769
00:34:07.479 --> 00:34:08.847
-Amina.
-ALL: Amina.

770
00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:11.150
Yeah. because you need
to understand the story. right?

771
00:34:11.183 --> 00:34:12.351
You cannot just...

772
00:34:12.384 --> 00:34:14.320
You need to understand
who Amina... Amina.

773
00:34:14.353 --> 00:34:15.487
-Amina.
-ALL: Amina.

774
00:34:15.521 --> 00:34:16.988
You've got to put it like that.

775
00:34:17.022 --> 00:34:19.525
You have to put
a little accent to it. Amina.

776
00:34:19.558 --> 00:34:21.527
-Amina.
-ALL: Amina.

777
00:34:23.028 --> 00:34:24.163
So Amina is here.

778
00:34:27.133 --> 00:34:29.701
And then she comes
and then she sees the aunties.

779
00:34:29.735 --> 00:34:30.802
and I'm sitting there.

780
00:34:30.836 --> 00:34:32.304
So all of a sudden. she says.

781
00:34:32.338 --> 00:34:34.573
"Aunties. aunties.
good afternoon.

782
00:34:34.606 --> 00:34:36.208
"Oh. good afternoon."

783
00:34:36.242 --> 00:34:37.976
And then one of the aunties
is like.

784
00:34:38.009 --> 00:34:40.479
"Eh. eh. Amina.

785
00:34:40.512 --> 00:34:42.214
"How are you now?

786
00:34:42.248 --> 00:34:43.315
"Oh. my gosh.

787
00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:45.217
"you are a big girl.

788
00:34:45.251 --> 00:34:47.153
"Ah! Beautiful!

789
00:34:47.186 --> 00:34:49.188
"How is your mother. Sarah?"

790
00:34:49.221 --> 00:34:52.158
She's like. "Oh. Auntie.
my mother is doing great."

791
00:34:52.191 --> 00:34:53.425
"Oh. you're going home.

792
00:34:53.459 --> 00:34:55.161
"When you go home.
say hi to your mother. eh?"

793
00:34:55.194 --> 00:34:58.530
"Uh-huh." "Tell her that
we say hello. okay. Amina?"

794
00:34:58.564 --> 00:35:00.832
So Amina is about to leave.
"Okay. bye. Amina.

795
00:35:00.866 --> 00:35:05.070
"Oh. my gosh. oh.
Ah. such a good girl."

796
00:35:05.171 --> 00:35:08.073
Bitch. Amina
did not take ten steps away.

797
00:35:08.174 --> 00:35:10.742
that auntie turned around me
and said.

798
00:35:10.776 --> 00:35:13.179
"You know this Amina kid. eh?

799
00:35:13.179 --> 00:35:15.013
"I hear that her mother.

800
00:35:15.046 --> 00:35:18.016
"that her mother
is a hateful bitch.

801
00:35:18.049 --> 00:35:20.085
"Her... And you see that Amina?

802
00:35:20.186 --> 00:35:23.255
"Look at Amina going like that.
That's a prostitute. eh?

803
00:35:23.289 --> 00:35:24.323
"She is a prostitute.

804
00:35:24.356 --> 00:35:27.193
"She is a published
prostitute. eh?

805
00:35:27.193 --> 00:35:30.829
"This... Ah! Ah! Look at her!
Dirty girl. eh!"

806
00:35:30.862 --> 00:35:32.097
I looked at that wo...

807
00:35:32.198 --> 00:35:33.599
I looked at the aunties.
I looked at myself.

808
00:35:33.632 --> 00:35:36.268
"Bitch. I'm not a published
prostitute. bitch."

809
00:35:36.302 --> 00:35:39.205
Bitch. no. can you imagine
being a published prostitute?

810
00:35:39.238 --> 00:35:41.207
Bitch. it means
you've made it. bitch.

811
00:35:43.309 --> 00:35:46.044
Bitch. how many people know
what published prostitute...

812
00:35:46.077 --> 00:35:48.214
Kevin. you do not know
what published prostitute...

813
00:35:48.214 --> 00:35:51.217
Bitch. it means he made
the back pages. bitch.

814
00:35:51.217 --> 00:35:53.219
Okay? It means you had
some money. girl. I couldn't...

815
00:35:53.252 --> 00:35:54.853
I was like. "Oh. these...

816
00:35:54.886 --> 00:35:58.257
"But y'all also know
how to gossip here."

817
00:35:59.658 --> 00:36:01.227
Amina.

818
00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:03.262
ALL: Amina.

819
00:36:05.431 --> 00:36:06.765
Amina.

820
00:36:06.798 --> 00:36:08.767
-Amina.
-ALL: Amina.

821
00:36:11.737 --> 00:36:13.439
Yeah. but you know what. people?

822
00:36:13.472 --> 00:36:15.073
I would still say that

823
00:36:15.106 --> 00:36:17.743
I am very happy
to be in America.

824
00:36:17.776 --> 00:36:19.010
I believe...

825
00:36:22.281 --> 00:36:24.115
In spite of it all...
In spite of it all.

826
00:36:24.149 --> 00:36:26.151
I'm very happy to be here.
in spite of it all.

827
00:36:26.252 --> 00:36:27.753
In spite of Amina.

828
00:36:27.786 --> 00:36:31.156
in spite of the Kevins.

829
00:36:31.257 --> 00:36:33.459
Bitch. I'm happy to be here
because you know what.

830
00:36:33.492 --> 00:36:37.829
even being here. I have
really achieved quite a bit.

831
00:36:45.271 --> 00:36:48.106
For those who have television.
you would know.

832
00:36:48.139 --> 00:36:49.808
Uh-huh. for those
who have television.

833
00:36:49.841 --> 00:36:51.943
you know I've won reality shows.

834
00:36:51.977 --> 00:36:54.813
I have had top charting music.

835
00:36:54.846 --> 00:36:56.448
I have gone viral.

836
00:36:56.482 --> 00:36:58.284
I have made TV appearances.

837
00:36:58.284 --> 00:37:00.085
I have been living the life.

838
00:37:00.118 --> 00:37:01.920
And I will not complain.

839
00:37:01.953 --> 00:37:07.559
But bitch. nothing
was so important to me

840
00:37:07.593 --> 00:37:09.861
than getting my citizenship.

841
00:37:13.299 --> 00:37:16.668
Bitch. when I got
my citizenship.

842
00:37:16.702 --> 00:37:19.004
that's how I knew
I made you Africans...

843
00:37:19.037 --> 00:37:20.339
And not just Africans.

844
00:37:20.372 --> 00:37:22.140
immigrants in the house.
make some noise.

845
00:37:23.375 --> 00:37:25.311
I'm talking about those
that came here

846
00:37:25.311 --> 00:37:27.413
because immigrants can be
many different things.

847
00:37:27.446 --> 00:37:28.847
But those that came here.
make some noise.

848
00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.449
All four of you? There you go.

849
00:37:30.482 --> 00:37:32.918
So you will know exactly
what I'm talking about.

850
00:37:32.951 --> 00:37:35.887
why America
makes it so hard. bitch.

851
00:37:35.921 --> 00:37:38.189
for us to get our papers. honey.

852
00:37:38.223 --> 00:37:40.892
They make it so difficult

853
00:37:40.926 --> 00:37:42.227
to become a citizen here.

854
00:37:42.328 --> 00:37:44.229
and which I really
don't understand.

855
00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:47.198
Because a lot of the jobs here.
you don't wanna do them.

856
00:37:47.232 --> 00:37:48.199
And then we come here

857
00:37:48.233 --> 00:37:50.369
and we do the jobs
for you bitches.

858
00:37:50.402 --> 00:37:53.004
and you still don't wanna
give us our paper.

859
00:37:56.675 --> 00:37:58.143
I don't get it.

860
00:37:58.176 --> 00:38:00.145
Do you all... Do you just...
Okay. just to let you know

861
00:38:00.178 --> 00:38:02.348
with the whole citizen...
Citizenship process.

862
00:38:02.348 --> 00:38:04.850
it's like this exam
that you have to study.

863
00:38:04.883 --> 00:38:06.718
Bitch. you have to study it

864
00:38:06.752 --> 00:38:09.821
like your life
depends on it. bitch.

865
00:38:09.855 --> 00:38:11.357
I'm telling you.
you don't understand.

866
00:38:11.357 --> 00:38:12.958
It is so tedious.

867
00:38:12.991 --> 00:38:16.462
You've got to know
all of these things
about American history.

868
00:38:16.495 --> 00:38:18.630
And... Right?
How many people studied...

869
00:38:18.664 --> 00:38:20.131
Did you study the exam?

870
00:38:20.165 --> 00:38:22.368
Yeah. And legislature. right?

871
00:38:22.368 --> 00:38:24.370
Wasn't that a pain...
It was a lot

872
00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:27.072
to learn all of those answers
in the question...

873
00:38:27.105 --> 00:38:28.707
And the gag about it is that

874
00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:31.076
99% of all you Americans. Kevin.

875
00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:33.745
do not even know the answers.

876
00:38:33.779 --> 00:38:36.482
Bitch. you don't even
know the answers.

877
00:38:36.515 --> 00:38:39.250
But then you're making us
do all that bullshit.

878
00:38:42.053 --> 00:38:43.389
Somebody got it now?

879
00:38:44.289 --> 00:38:45.591
Okay. somebody got it now.

880
00:38:45.624 --> 00:38:49.227
How many people here
are proud to be American?

881
00:38:52.063 --> 00:38:53.699
I know a lot
is going on right now.

882
00:38:53.732 --> 00:38:55.200
but think about the glory days.

883
00:38:55.233 --> 00:38:59.270
If you are a proud American.
make some noise.

884
00:39:03.041 --> 00:39:04.410
What's your name. sweetheart?

885
00:39:05.544 --> 00:39:07.679

You know. sometimes
it depends on the day.

985
00:43:50.161 --> 00:43:54.332
When I am proud. it's because
of what they said though

986
00:43:54.365 --> 00:43:57.602
When I'm not proud
it's because of everything else.

987

A little too much. but okay.

1015
00:46:11.937 --> 00:46:14.672
Contestant number three.

1016
00:46:17.876 --> 00:46:21.112
What's the name of the doctor

1017
00:46:21.146 --> 00:46:26.952
who performed Pamela Anderson's
breast augmentation surgery?

1018
00:46:28.319 --> 00:46:32.457
We also need the exact date
and time of the procedure.

1019
00:46:45.871 --> 00:46:48.306

1020
00:46:51.076 --> 00:46:52.677
Failed.

Failed. Uh. you know what?
Ahem.

1022
00:46:57.548 --> 00:46:58.583
Agent.

You can take them.

1024

You can take them. Yeah.

00:47:16.902 --> 00:47:18.136
I'm sorry.

1030
00:47:18.603 --> 00:47:19.604
I'm sorry.

1031
00:47:22.773 --> 00:47:25.110
I tried. I tried.

1032
00:47:25.143 --> 00:47:28.413
Bitch. that is what
any immigrants would know.

1033
00:47:28.446 --> 00:47:30.781
Bitch. that is the process.

1034
00:47:30.815 --> 00:47:34.485
That is what it takes
to live in this country.

1035
00:47:35.286 --> 00:47:37.822
Pamela's breast augmentation.

1036
00:47:40.025 --> 00:47:41.559
But people. I have to tell you.

1037
00:47:41.592 --> 00:47:45.196
when I got my citizenship...
And. yes. I got my citizenship.

1038
00:47:48.633 --> 00:47:49.968
I did. bitch.

1039
00:47:50.001 --> 00:47:52.503
When I passed my citizenship.

1040
00:47:53.171 --> 00:47:55.073
it was everything.

1041
00:47:55.106 --> 00:47:56.942
It was everything to me. bitch.

1042
00:47:56.975 --> 00:47:58.743
I could go to...

1043
00:47:58.776 --> 00:48:01.346
I could vote because
voting is the big one.
you know what I'm saying?

1044
00:48:01.379 --> 00:48:04.983
And speaking of voting.
all of you bitches need to
go out there and vote. honey.

1045
00:48:05.016 --> 00:48:07.953
-Okay?
-

1046
00:48:07.953 --> 00:48:09.854
Y'all need to go out there
and vote. honey.

1047
00:48:09.955 --> 00:48:12.323
They are really trying
to take our shit away.

1048
00:48:12.357 --> 00:48:14.492
But they'll soon know
what I'm talking about.

1049
00:48:14.525 --> 00:48:18.563
Kevin. you probably don't know
what I'm talking about. But...

1050
00:48:18.596 --> 00:48:20.498
Kevin. do you know
what I'm talking about?

1051
00:48:20.531 --> 00:48:22.333
Okay. what am I
talking about. Kevin?

1052
00:48:26.371 --> 00:48:27.973
Our freedom. Kevin?

1053
00:48:33.378 --> 00:48:35.580
Kevin. our? O-U-R?

1054
00:48:36.581 --> 00:48:38.583
I don't know
about that. Kevin.

1055
00:48:38.616 --> 00:48:41.886
because you're not
giving me "our." honey.

1056
00:48:41.987 --> 00:48:43.388
But people. like. I have to say.

1057
00:48:43.421 --> 00:48:46.191
like. when I won and I was here

1058
00:48:46.224 --> 00:48:47.725
and I got my citizenship.

1059
00:48:47.758 --> 00:48:50.061
bitch. when I got
that citizenship.

1060
00:48:50.095 --> 00:48:52.030
it was everything to me. bitch.

1061
00:48:52.063 --> 00:48:53.898
I was at the grocery store.

1062
00:48:53.999 --> 00:48:56.234
I would see this old lady
trying to get her fruits
or whatever. bitch.

1063
00:48:56.267 --> 00:48:58.203
and I was just waving my ticket.
I was like.

1064
00:48:58.236 --> 00:49:00.905
"Bitch. I'm a citizen!
Bitch. I'm a citizen!

1065
00:49:01.006 --> 00:49:02.540
Everywhere.
"Bitch. I'm a citizen."

1066
00:49:02.573 --> 00:49:06.044
And it was just...
It just meant so much to me.

1067
00:49:06.077 --> 00:49:08.346
It meant so much to me
because here I am in America

1068
00:49:08.379 --> 00:49:10.281
and people. I know
you guys have been here.

1069
00:49:10.315 --> 00:49:12.550
and I'm so happy that you guys
came here to see me.

1070
00:49:12.583 --> 00:49:14.485
but I will tell you this.

1071
00:49:14.519 --> 00:49:17.022
I mean. because there's...
There's an end to
all of these conversations.

1072
00:49:17.055 --> 00:49:19.824
the differences.
the similarities. Blah. blah.
blah. blah. blah.

1073
00:49:19.857 --> 00:49:24.629
What that means to me
is that America
is such a melting pot

1074
00:49:24.662 --> 00:49:29.034
where there are so many. many
people who live in this country.

1075
00:49:29.034 --> 00:49:31.302
and what makes this country
so beautiful

1076
00:49:31.336 --> 00:49:35.306
are the differences that
exists here in this country.

1077
00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:38.243
-Every single person

1078
00:49:38.276 --> 00:49:42.147
that is in this country
is from somewhere

1079
00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:43.414
and what makes it beautiful.

1080
00:49:43.448 --> 00:49:46.051
when we can sit here
and we can laugh

1081
00:49:46.051 --> 00:49:47.218
and have a good time

1082
00:49:47.252 --> 00:49:49.054
is because we can talk
about our differences

1083
00:49:49.087 --> 00:49:50.221
and they are funny.

1084
00:49:50.255 --> 00:49:53.824
but they also make us together.

1085
00:49:53.858 --> 00:49:55.060
make us be together.

1086
00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:57.362
They make us
align our energies together.

1087
00:49:57.395 --> 00:49:59.097
Do you know what I'm saying?

1088
00:49:59.130 --> 00:50:00.698
So we should love being here.

1089
00:50:00.731 --> 00:50:03.068
We should love
the freedom of being gay.

1090
00:50:03.101 --> 00:50:04.602
Okay? We should love...

1091
00:50:04.635 --> 00:50:06.904
We should love.
We should be able to...

1092
00:50:06.937 --> 00:50:08.073
We should take that time

1093
00:50:08.106 --> 00:50:09.540
and really. really
just love the freedom.

1094
00:50:09.574 --> 00:50:11.376
and that's why
I'm so excited to be here.

1095
00:50:11.409 --> 00:50:13.078
That's why I'm a proud African.

1096
00:50:13.111 --> 00:50:16.081
but I'm also
a very proud American.

1097
00:50:16.114 --> 00:50:17.082
Yes. I am.

1098
00:50:20.285 --> 00:50:21.719
So I am saying. people.

1099
00:50:21.752 --> 00:50:24.122
as we're enjoying the freedom
here in America.

1100
00:50:24.155 --> 00:50:25.223
we need to love each other

1101
00:50:25.256 --> 00:50:26.724
and we need to love ourselves

1102
00:50:26.757 --> 00:50:29.560
and we need
to celebrate the freedom

1103
00:50:29.594 --> 00:50:31.562
that we have here
in this country.

1104
00:50:31.596 --> 00:50:34.099
So when you are sitting
at that restaurant

1105
00:50:34.132 --> 00:50:36.934
and you see that immigrant
who is sitting right there

1106
00:50:36.967 --> 00:50:39.937
going through the phone book
of a menu trying to figure out.

1107
00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:41.439
"Bitch. what am I going to eat?"

1108
00:50:41.472 --> 00:50:43.608
You just lean all the way back

1109
00:50:43.641 --> 00:50:47.412
with your basket of seasonings
and that hot sauce

1110
00:50:47.445 --> 00:50:52.250
and tell them.
"Bitch. it gets greater later."

1111
00:50:52.283 --> 00:50:53.951
Thank you so much. everybody.

1112
00:51:00.125 --> 00:51:01.959
Bye.

1113
00:51:01.992 --> 00:51:03.694
Bye. people.

1114
00:51:08.866 --> 00:51:10.835
Amina!

1115
00:51:10.868 --> 00:51:12.470
ALL: Amina!

1116
00:51:12.503 --> 00:51:14.672
Thank you. everybody.

1117
00:51:29.554 --> 00:51:34.692
* You can be tender
and I'll be lightning

1118
00:51:34.725 --> 00:51:38.729
* You can be a match
and I'll be gasoline

1119
00:51:39.864 --> 00:51:44.769
* Something like a tower
and electricity

1120
00:51:44.802 --> 00:51:50.175
* I really like a chemistry
and I've been patient

1121
00:51:50.175 --> 00:51:51.709
* But I can keep on

1122
00:51:51.742 --> 00:51:54.712
* Waiting. waiting. waiting
waiting. waiting *
