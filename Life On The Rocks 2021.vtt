Everybody's got issues. you know?

Well. life's not comfortable.

20
00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:14.199
it's not boring.

21
00:01:16.158 --> 00:01:17.243
You know. 'cause when
you're on the streets

22
00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:20.538
you never know what you'll

40
00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:10.839
Probably shouldn't have
eaten that dumpster burrito.

41
00:02:12.173 --> 00:02:13.716
- [Davy] So are you gonna say something?

42
00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:15.552
- [Nate] What? I gotta say something?

43
00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:18.138
- [Davy] Well. it's a big bust.

44
00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:19.722
It's the cherry on top of your career.

45
00:02:19.722 --> 00:02:20.515
- [Nate] Yeah. sure.

46
00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:21.850
but they don't even have a conviction yet.

47
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.144
C'mon. they don't even have a trial date.

48
00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:25.895
- [Davy] Yeah. but they
have all the evidence.

49
00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:27.397
it's a slam dunk.

50
00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:28.982
Everybody's gonna take credit

51
00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:31.818
so I think you should be at
least prepared to say something.

52
00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:32.652
- [Nate] Okay.

53
00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:33.903

pushers get off the dais.

00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:35.655

58
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.623
You need to go to the hospital? Huh?

59
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.170
- [Nate] What did you take. huh?

60
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.588
Let's get him up.

61
00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:53.590
- Should we take him in?

62
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.591
- What for? Let's just
get him out of here.

63
00:02:55.591 --> 00:02:58.052
- I think I have the shits. (burps)

64
00:02:58.052 --> 00:03:00.388
- There's a bar here with a restroom.

65
00:03:00.388 --> 00:03:02.974
Can you make it in there?
- I gotta stay with my stuff.

67

You want some? I'm off in an hour.

76
00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:24.287
- Not really.

77
00:03:24.287 --> 00:03:27.123
- How about some fries with
that burger? It's on me.

78
00:03:27.123 --> 00:03:29.000
- What exactly do you
think that order of fries

79
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.335
entitles you to?

80
00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:35.715

00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:13.010
- [Man 2] You can't even walk

182
00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.721
into a public bathroom these days.

183
00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:19.559
- [Woman] They can't be here.
and you can't tell them that.

184
00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:22.895
(pensive music playing)

185
00:09:40.454 --> 00:09:42.790
(car honks)

186
00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:47.962
- You know we didn't reorder
as much as we did last month.

187
00:09:47.962 --> 00:09:51.090
- It's been slow. holidays maybe.

188
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:53.134
I can add a couple of specials
on some foo-foo drinks.

189
00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:54.343
if you'd like.

190
00:09:54.343 --> 00:09:56.178
- I don't know. maybe.

191
00:09:58.889 --> 00:10:01.350
(door shuts)

192
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:02.184
- Oh jeez.

193
00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:10.985
- What. you know this guy?

194
00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:12.361
- Just some homeless dude.

195
00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:13.821
- Some homeless dude is
(indistinct) on our living.

196
00:10:13.821 --> 00:10:16.699
homeless people come in
and use my bathroom now.

197
00:10:16.699 --> 00:10:17.533
- I didn't invite him.

198
00:10:17.533 --> 00:10:19.535
he just has a drink here
every once in a while.

199
00:10:19.535 --> 00:10:21.078
- Still. is he stealing stuff?

200
00:10:21.078 --> 00:10:22.330
You don't know what he's
doing right there. right?

201
00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:23.998
Grabbing soap. paper towels.

202
00:10:23.998 --> 00:10:26.459
- No. I checked. Nothing
seems out of place.

203
00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:28.544
- Yeah. but you don't
know if he's in there

204
00:10:28.544 --> 00:10:29.837
washing his underwear.

205
00:10:29.837 --> 00:10:30.671
(chuckles)

206
00:10:30.671 --> 00:10:31.756
- Well. no.

207
00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:35.635
- Christ. he could be
shooting up. jerking off.

208
00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:36.552
- [Buddy] I don't know.

209
00:10:36.552 --> 00:10:38.387
- Yeah. you don't know.

210
00:10:38.387 --> 00:10:40.139
How often does he come in?

211
00:10:40.139 --> 00:10:45.144
- He used to come quite
often. not so much anymore.

212
00:10:45.144 --> 00:10:45.978
- I just think it's nuts

213
00:10:45.978 --> 00:10:49.482
letting a guy like that even come in here.

214
00:10:51.108 --> 00:10:52.568
Get rid of him.

215
00:10:52.568 --> 00:10:53.611
- How?

216
00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:55.863
- How? What do I care how?

217
00:10:55.863 --> 00:10:58.074
Tell him adios. arrivederci.

218
00:10:58.074 --> 00:11:00.660
you could use the word. leave.

219
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:04.080
I don't care. just get rid of him.

220
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.581
- Hey buddy. same.

221
00:11:06.832 --> 00:11:11.128
- You get over there and
kick the bum out. go.

222
00:11:11.128 --> 00:11:12.213
Jesus Christ.

223
00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:17.551
(siren wailing at a distance)

224
00:11:17.551 --> 00:11:20.262
- Speed. we're not serving you anymore.

225
00:11:20.262 --> 00:11:21.180
- If you're running low on Jack.

226
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.807
Johnny's fine. I'll take Johnny.

227
00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:24.266
- It's not the type of
whiskey we're not serving.

228
00:11:24.266 --> 00:11:28.270
it's you. we're not serving you anymore.

229
00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:29.939
- Is that the boss?

230
00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:30.773
- I'm the boss.

231
00:11:30.773 --> 00:11:31.607
(chuckles)

232
00:11:31.607 --> 00:11:32.608
- You're fucking with me. come on.

233
00:11:32.608 --> 00:11:34.610
- I'm gonna be fucking with
you if you don't leave.

234
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.737
- Is that what you want?

235
00:11:36.737 --> 00:11:38.572
- Yeah. that's what I want.

236
00:11:38.572 --> 00:11:39.740
- Positive?

237
00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:40.866
- I'm positive.

238
00:11:40.866 --> 00:11:41.951
- Is it that positive. yes-

239
00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:44.453
- Stop fucking with me. Speed.

240
00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.040
- Just one pour. one pour and I'll go.

241
00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.084
- I'm not gonna give you one pour

242
00:11:50.084 --> 00:11:51.168
'cause you're just gonna sit there

243
00:11:51.168 --> 00:11:53.421
and stare at the glass for an hour.

244
00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:54.714
- Sometimes you gotta treat a whiskey

245
00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:56.132
like a beautiful woman. you know?

246
00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:57.466
You gotta stare at it a little bit.

247
00:11:57.466 --> 00:11:59.301
romance it a little bit because.

248
00:11:59.301 --> 00:12:01.303
you know. I didn't say
that. somebody else said it.

249
00:12:01.303 --> 00:12:02.847
- Hey. how are you doing?

250
00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:06.475
I'm Murray Adler. I own this place.

251
00:12:06.475 --> 00:12:09.437
- Speed. they call me Speed.

252
00:12:09.437 --> 00:12:14.066
- So Buddy tells me you're
a pretty frequent customer.

253
00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:15.484
- I suppose I am.

254
00:12:15.484 --> 00:12:18.070
- Yeah? Any reason why
you choose my place?

255
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:20.448
- It's on my way home.

256
00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:22.032
- And where's home?

257
00:12:23.701 --> 00:12:24.744
- 5th Street.

258
00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:28.080
- 5th Street. under the bridge. 10 City?

259
00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:32.626
- You know there's another bar.

260
00:12:32.626 --> 00:12:36.088
that's even closer to where you're living.

261
00:12:37.006 --> 00:12:38.758
- I like your place.

262
00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:39.884
- And I appreciate that.

263
00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:41.927
- Although your clientele
could use a little cultivating.

264
00:12:41.927 --> 00:12:42.762
- The client could use...

265
00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:45.598
Are you listening to this asshole?

266
00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:47.558
- So what do you mean

267
00:12:47.558 --> 00:12:50.519
my clientele could use some cultivating?

268
00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:51.729
- Nothing. nothing.

269
00:12:51.729 --> 00:12:53.689
I'll just have my... I'll have my drink.

270
00:12:53.689 --> 00:12:56.317
- He's not gonna pour you a drink.

271
00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:57.860
Okay. listen to me. I'm
not gonna coddle you

272
00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.111
like my bartender. okay?

273
00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:01.906
I want you to leave. and
I want you to leave now.

274
00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:03.365
I think I'm being a nice guy.

275
00:13:03.365 --> 00:13:05.743
I'm asking nice. I think
I'm being very polite.

276
00:13:05.743 --> 00:13:09.872
but if you don't leave I'm
gonna have to call the cops.

277
00:13:09.872 --> 00:13:12.208
- There's not a good
reason not to serve me.

278
00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:13.709
- I don't need a reason. okay?

279
00:13:13.709 --> 00:13:15.127
Come on. let's...

280
00:13:17.421 --> 00:13:21.675
- Okay. I know this is not
my business. it's your place.

281
00:13:21.675 --> 00:13:22.510
I get it.

282
00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.513
It's just... It's bartender 101. okay?

283
00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:26.889
You just need a little bit of order here.

284
00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:28.432
You know. you put your
Bourbons with your Bourbons.

285
00:13:28.432 --> 00:13:29.934
and your scotch with your scotch.

286
00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:31.352
and your ryes with your ryes.

287
00:13:31.352 --> 00:13:32.561
You know. you don't want
people having to navigate

288
00:13:32.561 --> 00:13:34.313
through a maze of bottles
just to find a drink.

289
00:13:34.313 --> 00:13:36.273
and your limes. are full of brown edges.

290
00:13:36.273 --> 00:13:37.608
I mean. these weren't cut today.

291
00:13:37.608 --> 00:13:38.776
it's old. and people are gonna know

292
00:13:38.776 --> 00:13:40.736
that you use old product
and it doesn't look good.

293
00:13:40.736 --> 00:13:43.280
And some snacks. you
know? Some salty stuff.

294
00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.782
Just get some chips and some pretzels.

295
00:13:44.782 --> 00:13:47.117
salty stuff is cheap.
it makes people thirsty.

296
00:13:47.117 --> 00:13:48.410
And a little bit of entertainment.

297
00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:50.913
just a little bit of guitar.
a little bit of piano.

298
00:13:50.913 --> 00:13:52.456
- Okay.

299
00:13:52.456 --> 00:13:53.290
(chuckles)

300
00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:57.837
Can you just take it easy.
all right? For a second.

301
00:13:57.837 --> 00:13:59.171
- It'd be great.

302
00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:06.053
I used to be a bartender.

303
00:14:06.053 --> 00:14:06.887
(scoffs)

304
00:14:06.887 --> 00:14:08.430
- What'd you do? Drink the inventory?

305
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:11.058
- No. I didn't drink the inventory.

306
00:14:11.058 --> 00:14:12.810
I got out of the army.

307
00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:15.771
I got a job. I got married.

308
00:14:15.771 --> 00:14:17.398
I lost my job. I got divorced.

309
00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:19.233
- [Buddy] Oh. I feel for you.

310
00:14:19.233 --> 00:14:21.235
- And I had friends. I
had drinking friends.

311
00:14:21.235 --> 00:14:23.362
(chuckles)

312
00:14:23.362 --> 00:14:25.239
until drinking became my only friend.

313
00:14:25.239 --> 00:14:28.993
- So. why do you keep
coming back here. right?

314
00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:30.744
Just like you said. you don't even like

315
00:14:30.744 --> 00:14:32.913
the way I run the place. right?

316
00:14:32.913 --> 00:14:35.749
I mean. you could do
far more with your money

317
00:14:35.749 --> 00:14:37.501
at any liquor store.

318
00:14:37.501 --> 00:14:41.338
- You collect cans for Christ's sake.

319
00:14:41.338 --> 00:14:42.423
- You don't know how much money I have.

320
00:14:42.423 --> 00:14:44.258
I got plenty of money.

321
00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:47.386
Enough for a drink.

322
00:14:47.386 --> 00:14:49.305
it's not enough for tip.
- I don't want your tip.

323
00:14:49.305 --> 00:14:50.514
- [Speed] You wanna know why I don't tip?

324
00:14:50.514 --> 00:14:51.724
- I don't care.

325
00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:53.601
- It's 'cause he waters down the booze.

326
00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:54.935
I know the taste of water

327
00:14:54.935 --> 00:14:56.395
as well as I know the taste of Jack.

328
00:14:56.395 --> 00:14:59.023
and I know when I'm
drinking watered down booze.

329
00:14:59.023 --> 00:15:02.610
- So why do you keep coming back here?

330
00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.695
- I used to drink. a lot.

331
00:15:06.697 --> 00:15:07.573
but ever since coming here

332
00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:09.742
and drinking Buddy's watered down booze.

333
00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:12.036
it's been a little like rehab.

334
00:15:12.036 --> 00:15:15.164
And I think in just a little
bit. a little bit. just a week.

335
00:15:15.164 --> 00:15:17.750
I'll have it. I'll be dry.

336
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.628
- Why don't you just go home
and water down your own liquor?

337
00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:23.255
Who comes to a bar to get sober?

338
00:15:23.255 --> 00:15:24.757
That's just crazy.

339
00:15:28.302 --> 00:15:29.595
- Out there. when I drink

340
00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:32.932
I'm just a homeless guy getting drunk.

341
00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:34.808
Here. when I saddle up to the bar.

342
00:15:34.808 --> 00:15:37.895
when I saddle up to your bar. it's...

343
00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:41.106
I'm somebody. here I'm somebody.

344
00:15:41.106 --> 00:15:44.109
- Nope. still just a homeless dude.

345
00:15:44.109 --> 00:15:45.694
and you stink.

346
00:15:45.694 --> 00:15:48.697
And that's why you gotta go.

347
00:15:48.697 --> 00:15:51.200
- You wanna know why
else I like coming here?

348
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.118
It's 'cause here I can look across the bar

349
00:15:53.118 --> 00:15:54.286
and look down at somebody else.

350
00:15:54.286 --> 00:15:55.496
You know. I might be living on the street.

351
00:15:55.496 --> 00:15:58.665
but at least I'm not a thief. okay?

352
00:15:58.665 --> 00:16:00.417
- Hey. back off!

353
00:16:00.417 --> 00:16:01.710
- I don't have to listen to this shit.

354
00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:03.712
- Get outta here.

355
00:16:03.712 --> 00:16:05.798
Jesus! Are you all right?

356
00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:10.970
I'm sorry that you feel

357
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.721
Buddy's watering down your drinks. okay?

358
00:16:12.721 --> 00:16:15.015
I have to think of my bottom line.

359
00:16:15.015 --> 00:16:16.767
it's just business. right pal?

360
00:16:16.767 --> 00:16:19.937
- Just one more. One more and I'll go.

361
00:16:21.188 --> 00:16:23.148
(sighs)

362
00:16:27.152 --> 00:16:28.070
- One more.

363
00:16:30.948 --> 00:16:34.284
(pensive music playing)

364
00:16:38.706 --> 00:16:41.375
(drink pouring)

365
00:16:47.172 --> 00:16:48.424
- For you. sir.

366
00:16:52.469 --> 00:16:55.305
I have appreciated your hospitality.

367
00:16:55.305 --> 00:16:58.100
♪ Lord lift me up ♪

368
00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:01.687
♪ I've stayed far enough ♪

369
00:17:01.687 --> 00:17:05.482

375
00:17:23.916 --> 00:17:24.835
(upbeat music)

376
00:17:24.835 --> 00:17:28.547
- I don't even want you
stepping near my place.

377
00:17:28.547 --> 00:17:30.007
Because I don't need a bum like you

378
00:17:30.007 --> 00:17:32.551
ruining my business. how's that?

379
00:17:32.551 --> 00:17:33.886
Are you kidding me?

380
00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:34.803
Can you believe this guy?

381
00:17:34.803 --> 00:17:35.679
- Some people.
(chuckling)

382
00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:37.139
- [Murray] Jesus!

383
00:17:37.139 --> 00:17:39.808
(bottle hisses)

384
00:17:39.808 --> 00:17:40.642
- You never know what you're gonna find

385
00:17:40.642 --> 00:17:42.311
when you turn a corner.

386
00:17:42.311 --> 00:17:44.938
Look at me. all cleaned up.

387
00:17:44.938 --> 00:17:46.565
I'm a man reborn. who now pours drinks

388
00:17:46.565 --> 00:17:50.235
for the financially
solvent. privileged people.

389
00:17:50.235 --> 00:17:54.156
Doesn't get much more
obladi-oblada than that.

390
00:17:54.156 --> 00:17:56.283
And behind this bar.

391
00:17:56.283 --> 00:17:59.244
you look like a priest. you know?

392
00:17:59.244 --> 00:18:00.829
I'll listen to your woes

393
00:18:00.829 --> 00:18:03.082
and dole out 80 proof indulgences.

394
00:18:03.082 --> 00:18:05.167
(drinks fizzling)

395
00:18:05.167 --> 00:18:07.002
Or you can act a fool.

396
00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.466
sorta like I'm in a confession.

397
00:18:14.218 --> 00:18:16.887
I hear all. my lips are sealed.

398
00:18:16.887 --> 00:18:19.431
and I don't make any
judgments. no judgments.

399
00:18:19.431 --> 00:18:20.682
unless I'm asked.

400
00:18:20.682 --> 00:18:21.809
- [Man 5] You voted for an asshole

401
00:18:21.809 --> 00:18:22.643
- So you can ask.

402
00:18:22.643 --> 00:18:25.062
Hey. you guys need some nuts?

403
00:18:26.313 --> 00:18:28.732
(calm music)

404
00:18:41.995 --> 00:18:43.789
Nobody likes to be alone.

405
00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:45.374
I mean. some people say
that it's an opportunity

406
00:18:45.374 --> 00:18:47.835
to find themselves. but...

407
00:18:47.835 --> 00:18:49.336
That's bullshit

408
00:18:49.336 --> 00:18:50.921
If somebody tells you that
they like to be alone.

409
00:18:50.921 --> 00:18:53.590
it's more than likely
that nobody likes them.

410
00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:55.884
or just as likely that
they don't like you.

411
00:18:55.884 --> 00:18:59.471
because nobody likes to be alone.

412
00:18:59.471 --> 00:19:02.558
(calm music playing)

413
00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:09.731
- Yeah.

414
00:19:09.731 --> 00:19:12.067
And. I'd love you to see it.

415
00:19:17.239 --> 00:19:18.782
I need to go talk to a colleague.

416
00:19:18.782 --> 00:19:20.993
can you just give me one second?

417
00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:21.827
I'll be right back.

418
00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:23.620
- Fine.
- I'll be right back for you.

419
00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:24.454
- You better be.

420
00:19:24.454 --> 00:19:26.707
(chuckles)

421
00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:29.001
- Didi.

422
00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:30.836
- Oh. hi Milo.

423
00:19:30.836 --> 00:19:32.462
- How have you been?

424
00:19:32.462 --> 00:19:33.589
- Good.

425
00:19:33.589 --> 00:19:36.508
- Oh. with the way the market
is. I guess good's good.

426
00:19:36.508 --> 00:19:38.677
- Well. maybe just okay.

427
00:19:38.677 --> 00:19:40.429
- Okay. Okay is good.

428
00:19:42.347 --> 00:19:44.850
- So let's catch up.

429
00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:46.393
- Catch up?

430
00:19:46.393 --> 00:19:47.394
- Gin tonic?

431
00:19:48.478 --> 00:19:49.313
(sighs)

432
00:19:49.313 --> 00:19:50.480
- I'm buying.

433
00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.149
- No. not right now.

434
00:19:53.275 --> 00:19:55.444
- Wasn't your hair longer before?

435
00:19:55.444 --> 00:19:58.572
- Yeah. I cut it two weeks ago.

436
00:19:58.572 --> 00:20:00.115
- Well. it's great.

437
00:20:00.115 --> 00:20:02.117
and you've lost weight.

438
00:20:02.117 --> 00:20:02.951
(chuckles)

439
00:20:02.951 --> 00:20:04.494
- I wish.

440
00:20:04.494 --> 00:20:05.954
- Well. you look great.

441
00:20:05.954 --> 00:20:07.873
and you're doing well for yourself.

442
00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:08.749
- How's that?

443
00:20:08.749 --> 00:20:11.418
- I see you driving the new Mercedes.

444
00:20:11.418 --> 00:20:16.298
- Hey. you know anyone that
wants to take over a lease?

445
00:20:16.298 --> 00:20:18.008
- So anything new on the market.

446
00:20:18.008 --> 00:20:19.885
or anything I should know about?

447
00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:21.553
- Not really.

448
00:20:21.553 --> 00:20:23.555
- You need listings. Dina.

449
00:20:23.555 --> 00:20:26.808
Buyers. sellers. you need to advertise.

450
00:20:27.851 --> 00:20:30.312
To make money you gotta spend money.

451
00:20:30.312 --> 00:20:33.106
- To spend money. you have to have money.

452
00:20:33.106 --> 00:20:36.109
But I've got a new flyer coming out.

453
00:20:37.778 --> 00:20:39.071
- Okay.

454
00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:40.405
Very old school.

455
00:20:41.657 --> 00:20:44.701
You need a polished
website. link in. network.

456
00:20:44.701 --> 00:20:47.913
but paper still has its place.

457
00:20:47.913 --> 00:20:49.665
Four-fold raise type.

458
00:20:50.958 --> 00:20:51.792
Nice. huh?

459
00:20:53.794 --> 00:20:54.628
- Hmm.

460
00:20:57.297 --> 00:20:58.131
Expensive.

461
00:20:59.216 --> 00:21:01.969
- Keep it. It's a new pocket listing

462
00:21:01.969 --> 00:21:03.971
on a $5 mil remodel in Mulholland.

463
00:21:03.971 --> 00:21:07.474
This place. top of the grade; Pool. view.

464
00:21:07.474 --> 00:21:11.645
five bedrooms. wine
cellar. even a theater.

465
00:21:11.645 --> 00:21:15.065
It's pricey to sell. but. you never know.

466
00:21:17.693 --> 00:21:21.863
Look. if I don't have a
buyer in a couple of days.

467
00:21:24.491 --> 00:21:27.661
would do you wanna sit by Mulholland?

468
00:21:27.661 --> 00:21:31.415
You'll pick up buyers. high rollers.

469
00:21:31.415 --> 00:21:33.000
- Sure. absolutely.

470
00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:38.714
- See. I don't wanna be
dealing with a lot of grazers

471
00:21:38.714 --> 00:21:40.716
in the office. you know?

472
00:21:42.551 --> 00:21:43.385
Just you.

473
00:21:50.475 --> 00:21:51.476
Are we good?

474
00:21:52.602 --> 00:21:53.437
- Yeah.

475
00:21:56.315 --> 00:21:58.567
- I wanna be friends. Didi.

476
00:22:03.697 --> 00:22:05.407
Maybe we could. uh...

477
00:22:05.407 --> 00:22:08.243
(Kasha chuckling)

478
00:22:09.202 --> 00:22:10.537
go out sometime.

479
00:22:11.663 --> 00:22:12.748
- Yeah. sure.

480
00:22:14.666 --> 00:22:18.503
- So. about the Mulholland.
I'm doing you one.

481
00:22:19.504 --> 00:22:22.090
I need you to do me one.

482
00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:23.300
- One what?

483
00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:24.634
- I need a favor.

484
00:22:24.634 --> 00:22:25.802
- Look. if there's anything that I can do-

485
00:22:25.802 --> 00:22:27.554
- I need to borrow your
car for a couple hours.

486
00:22:27.554 --> 00:22:28.513
- My car?

487
00:22:28.513 --> 00:22:30.057
- Just for a couple of hours.

488
00:22:30.057 --> 00:22:32.059
Didi. I'm doing you one.

489
00:22:33.143 --> 00:22:37.397
And if you bring me a buyer
on the Mulholland. hey.

490
00:22:38.607 --> 00:22:40.484
it's real money.

491
00:22:40.484 --> 00:22:41.818
Come on. please.

492
00:22:44.905 --> 00:22:47.616
(keys jingle)

493
00:22:47.616 --> 00:22:49.951
- What happened to your car?

494
00:22:51.953 --> 00:22:54.122
- I don't have it tonight.

495
00:22:55.207 --> 00:22:57.209
Look. do me one. please.

496
00:23:02.214 --> 00:23:03.048
(sighs)

497
00:23:03.048 --> 00:23:04.716
You're a sweetheart. thank you.

498
00:23:04.716 --> 00:23:06.760
Look. Saturday. you and I go

499
00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.762
for a ride in the Porsche. yeah?

500
00:23:08.762 --> 00:23:09.596
- You're gonna have your sports car

501
00:23:09.596 --> 00:23:11.598
fixed up by this weekend?

502
00:23:11.598 --> 00:23:12.516
- Fixed up?

503
00:23:13.392 --> 00:23:14.810
(slurps drink)

504
00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:16.061
Oh no. no. no. no. no. no. no.

505
00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:18.146
it's not in the shop. it's at home.

506
00:23:18.146 --> 00:23:22.025
- Then. why don't you just
drive home and switch cars?

507
00:23:22.025 --> 00:23:24.111
- Because... Evie's home.

508
00:23:29.157 --> 00:23:30.784
You remember Evie?

509
00:23:30.784 --> 00:23:31.618
- Evie?

510
00:23:32.577 --> 00:23:34.871
Nope. I don't know Evie.

511
00:23:34.871 --> 00:23:38.250
- Yeah. you do. You met her at the. uh...

512
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:39.084
What's that place?

513
00:23:39.084 --> 00:23:41.420
No. maybe you weren't there.

514
00:23:42.879 --> 00:23:45.298
Anyway. I told her. you know.

515
00:23:45.298 --> 00:23:46.633
I needed to go furniture shopping.

516
00:23:46.633 --> 00:23:48.510
and she told me to take the minivan.

517
00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:50.470
It's my fuck up.

518
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:52.514
- Evie's your girlfriend?

519
00:23:52.514 --> 00:23:54.474
- Yeah. we're sort of engaged

520
00:23:54.474 --> 00:23:56.017
- Engaged.

521
00:23:56.017 --> 00:23:58.437
Look Milo. I've got a huge deductible.

522
00:23:58.437 --> 00:23:59.604
- Don't worry about your car.

523
00:23:59.604 --> 00:24:03.150
nothing's gonna happen to your car. okay?

524
00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:05.652
Look. have a few drinks on me.

525
00:24:09.239 --> 00:24:10.532
- I don't drink.

526
00:24:13.535 --> 00:24:15.036
Who's your client?

527
00:24:16.204 --> 00:24:18.415
(chuckling)

528
00:24:18.415 --> 00:24:22.043
- I'll show it to her. and be right back.

529
00:24:22.043 --> 00:24:23.545
Hey. you're a gem.

530
00:24:28.216 --> 00:24:32.512
(enchanting guitar playing)

531
00:24:32.512 --> 00:24:34.598
- This place white bear's skin rug.

532
00:24:34.598 --> 00:24:37.726
with picture perfect
views of the Pacific Ocean

533
00:24:37.726 --> 00:24:41.396
(enchanting guitar playing)

534
00:25:27.275 --> 00:25:29.236
- [Speed] The world's full
of bastards. isn't it?

535
00:25:29.236 --> 00:25:30.070
- What?

536
00:25:31.112 --> 00:25:34.658
- I asked if you'd like anything else?

537
00:25:34.658 --> 00:25:36.701
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

538
00:25:36.701 --> 00:25:40.080
I can roll the clock on
back to happy for you.

539
00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:40.997
Happy hour?

540
00:25:42.874 --> 00:25:45.293
- All right. rum and coke.

541
00:25:45.293 --> 00:25:46.419
- A lemy.

542
00:25:46.419 --> 00:25:48.588
- No. just make it a Coke.

543
00:25:49.839 --> 00:25:51.633
- Just a Coke.

544
00:25:51.633 --> 00:25:54.511
- Yeah. I can drink. or not drink.

545
00:25:54.511 --> 00:25:55.428
- No. it's okay.

546
00:25:55.428 --> 00:25:56.930
It's just. I've never
seen you order any alcohol

547
00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:59.558
and I figured you're
either a Mormon or a Muslim

548
00:25:59.558 --> 00:26:02.143
without the head thing.

549
00:26:02.143 --> 00:26:03.728
- Well. both my parents were alcoholics.

550
00:26:03.728 --> 00:26:05.146
so I don't drink.

551
00:26:07.023 --> 00:26:10.193
I don't like the genetic risk factors.

552
00:26:11.486 --> 00:26:14.614
- Genetics. that's the excuse.

553
00:26:14.614 --> 00:26:16.241
It's just that everybody's got a vice.

554
00:26:16.241 --> 00:26:18.368
you know. everybody's addicted
to something. you know?

555
00:26:18.368 --> 00:26:22.789
Whether it's drinking.
smoking. overeating. drugs.

556
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:26.501
I figure you pick one vice and enjoy.

557
00:26:26.501 --> 00:26:28.253
because believe you me. if
you pound down one vice.

558
00:26:28.253 --> 00:26:31.715
another one pops back up in its place.

559
00:26:31.715 --> 00:26:35.885
So if you'd like a drink.
you should have a drink.

560
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:39.389
- Okay. Screwdriver.

561
00:26:39.389 --> 00:26:42.183
- Screwdriver coming up!

562
00:26:42.183 --> 00:26:45.270
- No. just make it a Virgin. just OJ.

563
00:26:48.106 --> 00:26:49.107
- All right.

564
00:27:01.786 --> 00:27:03.830
You know. I hate to lose a good customer.

565
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:07.375
but a wise man once told me
that coming and sitting at a bar

566
00:27:07.375 --> 00:27:08.501
when you're trying to stay sober

567
00:27:08.501 --> 00:27:11.588
is not the smartest of things.

568
00:27:11.588 --> 00:27:15.925
- I'm waiting for somebody
to come back with my car.

569
00:27:18.595 --> 00:27:21.681
(calm music playing)

570
00:27:25.769 --> 00:27:28.855
(indistinct chatter)

571
00:27:33.818 --> 00:27:36.237
(door opens)

572
00:27:38.156 --> 00:27:41.076
(enchanting music)

573
00:27:50.877 --> 00:27:52.796
- Give me vodka.

574
00:27:52.796 --> 00:27:56.132
No. (indistinct) vodka.

575
00:27:59.135 --> 00:28:02.931

576
00:28:02.931 --> 00:28:06.393

580
00:28:16.736 --> 00:28:18.113
- Orange juice.

581
00:28:18.113 --> 00:28:19.489
- Screwdriver?

582
00:28:19.489 --> 00:28:21.908
- No. it's just orange juice.

583
00:28:25.412 --> 00:28:27.997

- Old commercial. huh?

589
00:28:39.509 --> 00:28:40.885
My name is Viktor.

590
00:28:40.885 --> 00:28:43.221
- I'm not much in the mood
for socializing tonight.

591
00:28:43.221 --> 00:28:47.058
- Oh. do I look like I
came here for a hookup?

592
00:28:48.351 --> 00:28:49.936
I'm being friendly.

593
00:28:51.187 --> 00:28:53.815
- I'm sorry. I'm Dina.

594
00:28:53.815 --> 00:28:55.483
- Where are you from. Dina?

595
00:28:55.483 --> 00:28:57.026
- Here.

596
00:28:57.026 --> 00:28:59.404
- But. where do you come from?

597
00:28:59.404 --> 00:29:02.198
- Covina. I was born in Covina.

598
00:29:02.198 --> 00:29:06.327
- Okay. but your family.
where does it come from?

599
00:29:06.327 --> 00:29:08.913
- They moved to Covina from West Covina.

600
00:29:08.913 --> 00:29:13.168
- Okay. um. long. long.
long time ago. your family.

601
00:29:16.171 --> 00:29:18.256
they were Indians?

602
00:29:18.256 --> 00:29:19.841
Or were they immigrants?

603
00:29:19.841 --> 00:29:22.051
- Where do they come from?

604
00:29:22.051 --> 00:29:26.181
I was told that my great.
maybe. great. great grandfather.

605
00:29:26.181 --> 00:29:28.516
came from the Ukraine.

606
00:29:28.516 --> 00:29:31.853
- Ukraine. I knew it. We're compatriots.

607
00:29:39.277 --> 00:29:41.988
- Are we? Where are you from?

608
00:29:41.988 --> 00:29:42.947
- Are you ICE?

609
00:29:42.947 --> 00:29:43.782
- What?

610
00:29:43.782 --> 00:29:44.616
- Immigration?

611
00:29:44.616 --> 00:29:45.867
- No.

612
00:29:45.867 --> 00:29:47.827
- You have to tell me
if you are. you know?

613
00:29:47.827 --> 00:29:48.745
- I'm not.

614
00:29:48.745 --> 00:29:51.498
- So you're not ICE. no police. state. or

615
00:29:51.498 --> 00:29:52.874
(speaking in foreign language)

616
00:29:52.874 --> 00:29:54.000
- Definitely not...

617
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.376
(mumbling)

618
00:29:55.376 --> 00:29:58.546
- Look at you. mutilating my language.

619
00:29:59.464 --> 00:30:01.299
- Oh my God. I'm so sorry.

620
00:30:01.299 --> 00:30:03.218
- You hashtag. killed it.

621
00:30:03.218 --> 00:30:04.761
(chuckles)

622
00:30:04.761 --> 00:30:06.221
- Are you a Russian?

623
00:30:06.221 --> 00:30:07.472
- Ah. you know.

624
00:30:12.268 --> 00:30:14.062
What do you do. Dina?

625
00:30:14.062 --> 00:30:17.982
- Me? I sell real estate. I'm a realtor.

626
00:30:17.982 --> 00:30:20.819
- That's cool. I like real estate.

627
00:30:21.861 --> 00:30:26.491
You put a picture on the
wall. a bed in the bedroom.

628
00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:28.076
a woman on the bed.

629
00:30:29.118 --> 00:30:30.537
it's called home.

630
00:30:34.249 --> 00:30:36.543
I had a lot of houses.

631
00:30:36.543 --> 00:30:39.212
Hey. bring one more orange juice

632
00:30:41.297 --> 00:30:44.259
for my friend from Ukraine.

633
00:30:44.259 --> 00:30:46.928
(glasses clink)

634
00:30:50.181 --> 00:30:52.517
I'm a salesman too.

635
00:30:52.517 --> 00:30:53.351
- Hmm.

636
00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:54.936
- I sell favors

637
00:30:54.936 --> 00:30:57.230
- Like party favors?

638
00:30:57.230 --> 00:31:01.025
- Like. I make you a
favor and you pay for it.

639
00:31:01.025 --> 00:31:03.611
If it's a party you want.
I can give you a party.

640
00:31:03.611 --> 00:31:04.737
You want a party?

641
00:31:04.737 --> 00:31:06.281
- No. no.
(chuckles)

642
00:31:06.281 --> 00:31:08.157
I don't need a party.

643
00:31:08.157 --> 00:31:10.243
- What do you need. Dina?

644
00:31:12.203 --> 00:31:13.037
- Nothing?

645
00:31:15.164 --> 00:31:17.667
Well. buyers. I need buyers.

646
00:31:17.667 --> 00:31:18.585
- Buyers.

647
00:31:18.585 --> 00:31:22.922
- Yeah. you know. for real
estate? Buyers for houses.

648
00:31:22.922 --> 00:31:26.301
- I know buyers. What do you have?

649
00:31:26.301 --> 00:31:29.721
- Well. right now. I don't really have...

650
00:31:31.306 --> 00:31:35.143
Yes. I do! I have a new
listing on Mulholland.

651
00:31:37.729 --> 00:31:40.982
But it's expensive. $5 million.

652
00:31:40.982 --> 00:31:42.525
- That's not expensive.

653
00:31:42.525 --> 00:31:43.860
- It's not?

654
00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:46.613
No. it's not. and it's a bargain.

655
00:31:47.697 --> 00:31:52.201
- This house of yours. does
it have a bowling alley?

656
00:31:52.201 --> 00:31:53.745
- No.

657
00:31:53.745 --> 00:31:57.373
- I like to bowl. my friends like to bowl.

658
00:31:57.373 --> 00:32:00.752
- Maybe you could put a bowling alley in?

659
00:32:02.211 --> 00:32:03.796
The place has a wine cellar.

660
00:32:03.796 --> 00:32:05.632
- Yeah. I like wine.

661
00:32:05.632 --> 00:32:06.716
- And a movie theater.

662
00:32:06.716 --> 00:32:08.551
- Oh. I like The Rock.

663
00:32:11.012 --> 00:32:12.138
- Who doesn't?

664
00:32:12.138 --> 00:32:16.392
- The gentlemen. he
calls himself Dwayne now.

665
00:32:16.392 --> 00:32:18.895
It's his name. but I like him.

666
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:22.482
Okay. tomorrow.

667
00:32:23.858 --> 00:32:28.321
You're gonna call me. I'm
gonna bring my friends.

668
00:32:28.321 --> 00:32:30.782
We're going to be your buyers.

669
00:32:30.782 --> 00:32:33.076
- That'd be great.

670
00:32:33.076 --> 00:32:35.244
(patting)

671
00:32:36.537 --> 00:32:39.874
- See? I just did you a favor.

672
00:32:39.874 --> 00:32:42.877
It would be nice if
you did one for me too.

673
00:32:42.877 --> 00:32:45.338
- Oh boy. another favor.

674
00:32:45.338 --> 00:32:47.757
Somebody already has my car.

675
00:32:47.757 --> 00:32:50.635
- Why would I need your car?

676
00:32:50.635 --> 00:32:52.053
- I don't know.

677
00:32:52.053 --> 00:32:52.887
- Dina.

678
00:32:57.517 --> 00:33:02.522
you are a woman that comes to
a bar and drinks orange juice.

679
00:33:03.815 --> 00:33:06.109
you don't care what people think.

680
00:33:06.109 --> 00:33:10.571
You don't drink. you stay
sharp. you make deals.

681
00:33:10.571 --> 00:33:12.699
- Yeah. that's me.

682
00:33:12.699 --> 00:33:16.077
- So half an hour ago. my friend tells me

683
00:33:16.077 --> 00:33:17.996
that he had seen Kasha.

684
00:33:19.038 --> 00:33:21.958
my beautiful. little Kasha.

685
00:33:21.958 --> 00:33:24.293
leave this place with a man.

686
00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:26.879
- Hm-hmm.

687
00:33:26.879 --> 00:33:28.840
- You would have noticed her.

688
00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.675
- Well. I've just been
sitting here working.

689
00:33:30.675 --> 00:33:33.511
- Yes. but you would have noticed her.

690
00:33:33.511 --> 00:33:34.345
She is...

691
00:33:35.346 --> 00:33:36.472
- I don't notice those things.

692
00:33:36.472 --> 00:33:38.349
- No. of course not. of course not.

693
00:33:38.349 --> 00:33:42.729
but she doesn't blend in.
you would have noticed her.

694
00:33:42.729 --> 00:33:46.607
So have you seen this
man that she walked with?

695
00:33:47.525 --> 00:33:48.901
- Jeez.

696
00:33:48.901 --> 00:33:51.195
- Talk to me. my compatriot.

697
00:33:53.656 --> 00:33:56.868
- Viktor. I don't wanna get
anybody in any kind of trouble.

698
00:33:56.868 --> 00:33:58.953
Maybe they just went to see a movie.

699
00:33:58.953 --> 00:34:01.247
- There is no Dwayne playing.

700
00:34:01.247 --> 00:34:02.790
- Or bowling?

701
00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:03.916
(wrapper rustling)

702
00:34:03.916 --> 00:34:06.335
- She doesn't have any balls.

703
00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:13.676
You have friends and you have
enemies. no one in between.

704
00:34:15.511 --> 00:34:16.637
Are you my friend?

705
00:34:16.637 --> 00:34:17.889
- I'd like to be.

706
00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:21.893
- Of course. who wouldn't
wanna be my friend?

707
00:34:21.893 --> 00:34:25.813
- Viktor. I just... I don't
wanna see anybody get. killed.

708
00:34:25.813 --> 00:34:26.606
- Killed?

709
00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:30.650
Is that what you think
of me. that I'm a killer?

710
00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:32.235
I don't kill people.

711
00:34:32.235 --> 00:34:33.821
I'm like a teacher.

712
00:34:35.031 --> 00:34:37.199
I teach them lessons.

713
00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:38.534
- Yeah. but...

714
00:34:38.534 --> 00:34:41.079
- Oh. that's for my protection.

715
00:34:43.206 --> 00:34:47.918
Second amendment. I like
the first one even better;

716
00:34:47.918 --> 00:34:49.378
No search without a warrant.

717
00:34:49.378 --> 00:34:50.213
(chuckles nervously)

718
00:34:50.213 --> 00:34:52.422
But if you want my promise.

719
00:34:55.176 --> 00:34:57.345
this is my promise to you.

720
00:35:06.771 --> 00:35:07.730

725
00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.951
Picture yourself on a white. bear skin rug

with picture perfect views
of the Pacific Ocean.

727
00:35:24.497 --> 00:35:27.834
I think you'll find what you like there.

728
00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:34.048

- You know. for some events in life.

740
00:36:13.462 --> 00:36:16.007
it's the right place at the right time.

741
00:36:16.007 --> 00:36:18.676
Others. wrong place. wrong time.

742
00:36:20.428 --> 00:36:24.432
and sometimes they're the
same place. same time.

743
00:36:25.641 --> 00:36:26.934
- I just got a new client.

744
00:36:26.934 --> 00:36:28.936
- Yeah? What do you do?

745
00:36:29.812 --> 00:36:31.814
- I do people favors.

746
00:36:31.814 --> 00:36:34.734
(enchanting music)

747
00:36:44.452 --> 00:36:47.205
(dramatic music)

748
00:36:48.164 --> 00:36:51.250
(ice cubes clinking)

749
00:37:02.929 --> 00:37:03.763
- Hi.

750
00:37:04.722 --> 00:37:05.556
Hi. hi.

751
00:37:06.641 --> 00:37:10.895
I'm looking for a Nate
Vigil. old guy suit and tie.

752
00:37:13.648 --> 00:37:15.066
- I think he's in the restroom.

753
00:37:15.066 --> 00:37:16.359
- Thank you.

754
00:37:16.359 --> 00:37:19.445
(jazz music playing)

755
00:37:36.003 --> 00:37:37.421
Nate. Nate Vigil?

756
00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:39.924
- Do I know you?

757
00:37:44.011 --> 00:37:45.513
District Attorney's office.

758
00:37:45.513 --> 00:37:49.016
- The B'nai Simpson case. it
goes to grand jury next week.

759
00:37:49.016 --> 00:37:50.726
I'm handling it.

760
00:37:50.726 --> 00:37:52.478
- Well. you're awfully young to be an ADA.

761
00:37:52.478 --> 00:37:54.814
- Well. you're awfully old to be a cop.

762
00:37:54.814 --> 00:37:56.482
(scoffs)

763
00:37:56.482 --> 00:37:59.527
I went to the evidence locker today.

764
00:37:59.527 --> 00:38:00.361
- Yeah?

765
00:38:00.361 --> 00:38:01.195
- Yeah.

766
00:38:02.863 --> 00:38:04.115
- Okay?

767
00:38:04.115 --> 00:38:07.201
- And there's $20.000 missing.

768
00:38:07.201 --> 00:38:08.536
- Bullshit.

769
00:38:08.536 --> 00:38:10.204
- You're surprised.

770
00:38:10.204 --> 00:38:12.039
- Yeah. I'm surprised.

771
00:38:14.041 --> 00:38:15.418
- Well?

772
00:38:15.418 --> 00:38:17.211
- Well. what?

773
00:38:17.211 --> 00:38:18.713
Do you think I took the money?

774
00:38:18.713 --> 00:38:20.423
- You signed for it.

775
00:38:20.423 --> 00:38:23.134
- I didn't take any money.

776
00:38:23.134 --> 00:38:25.720
- Well. okay. It's not my job.

777
00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:27.555
but the detectives will be looking into it

778
00:38:27.555 --> 00:38:29.390
when I bring it up tomorrow.

779
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:31.517
- Oh. and why are you telling me this?

780
00:38:31.517 --> 00:38:33.311
- You may not remember. but you caught

781
00:38:33.311 --> 00:38:34.979
a skinny. fouled mouthed teenager.

782
00:38:34.979 --> 00:38:36.647
with a bunch of stolen credit cards.

783
00:38:36.647 --> 00:38:39.900
and you gave me a second chance.

784
00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:41.152
- No. that doesn't sound like me.

785
00:38:41.152 --> 00:38:41.986
- Yeah. it was you.

786
00:38:41.986 --> 00:38:43.988
- You tossed every. fuck you. I gave you.

787
00:38:43.988 --> 00:38:45.531
with a. fuck you right back.

788
00:38:45.531 --> 00:38:48.075
- That sounds like me.

789
00:38:48.075 --> 00:38:49.577
- I got my act together.

790
00:38:49.577 --> 00:38:53.331
I went to college. law
school. and here I am.

791
00:38:54.457 --> 00:38:57.918
- Yeah. well. I'm a big
fan of affirmative action.

792
00:38:57.918 --> 00:39:01.464
- Look. I'm here because I owed you one.

793
00:39:01.464 --> 00:39:05.009
So I suppose if the money
was there in the morning.

794
00:39:05.009 --> 00:39:06.093
I wouldn't know it was missing.

795
00:39:06.093 --> 00:39:07.011
- I didn't take any money.

796
00:39:07.011 --> 00:39:08.763
- It's not my problem.

797
00:39:08.763 --> 00:39:10.264
- What am I supposed to do?

798
00:39:10.264 --> 00:39:13.267
- You're a detective. figure it out.

799
00:39:20.024 --> 00:39:22.026
(sighs)

800
00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.154
- Fuck me.

801
00:39:34.622 --> 00:39:37.708
- I'm not an athlete. never had been.

802
00:39:38.834 --> 00:39:39.919
but when I was in high school

803
00:39:39.919 --> 00:39:42.630
my dad had me go out for boxing classes.

804
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:43.756
He though it would make a man out of me.

805
00:39:43.756 --> 00:39:45.674
So. I took the classes.

806
00:39:47.885 --> 00:39:51.013
and I got the hell beat out of me.

807
00:39:51.013 --> 00:39:56.018
I got my nose broke. I got
knocked out. numerous times.

808
00:39:56.435 --> 00:39:57.770
lost on decisions.

809
00:39:57.770 --> 00:40:00.898
for all intents and
purposes. I was a loser.

810
00:40:00.898 --> 00:40:02.942
And I can't tell you how many times

811
00:40:02.942 --> 00:40:06.529
I was in my corner. that
I didn't wanna get out.

812
00:40:06.529 --> 00:40:09.573
There was no way I was
gonna beat the other guy.

813
00:40:09.573 --> 00:40:11.450
and I was hurting.

814
00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:13.702
So my father. he would. uh.

815
00:40:13.702 --> 00:40:15.413
he would shove me out there.

816
00:40:15.413 --> 00:40:19.708
If you're still standing.
he said. you got a chance.

817
00:40:22.086 --> 00:40:26.632
Might've been the only thing
he was ever right about.

818
00:40:26.632 --> 00:40:29.802
- Of course. we can do the
salmon. Frankie. It's fine.

819
00:40:29.802 --> 00:40:31.053
(enchanting music)

820
00:40:31.053 --> 00:40:32.805
No. I just think our guest would prefer

821
00:40:32.805 --> 00:40:35.808
the grilled miso. instead
of the mustard tail.

822
00:40:35.808 --> 00:40:36.934
Yeah.

823
00:40:36.934 --> 00:40:39.854
Oh. we are so simpatico right now.

824
00:40:39.854 --> 00:40:41.272
I love you.

825
00:40:41.272 --> 00:40:42.815
I love you more.

826
00:40:42.815 --> 00:40:44.733
I love you. infinity.

827
00:40:44.733 --> 00:40:45.651
I gotta go.

828
00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:49.029
- You've seen my specs?

829
00:40:50.906 --> 00:40:51.740
Oh shit.

830
00:40:53.993 --> 00:40:54.994
- I'm sorry.

831
00:40:56.704 --> 00:40:59.748
- Goddammit Davy. this is the second pair

832
00:40:59.748 --> 00:41:01.292
that you've fucked up for me.

833
00:41:01.292 --> 00:41:03.210
- I know. I'm sorry. I'll
buy you another pair.

834
00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:05.421
- You're goddamn right you will.

835
00:41:05.421 --> 00:41:07.298
What's the matter with you?

836
00:41:07.298 --> 00:41:09.800
What. are you preoccupied about what?

837
00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.135
- Wedding plans.

838
00:41:12.595 --> 00:41:14.346
- Oh. wedding. right.

839
00:41:15.806 --> 00:41:17.641
Expensive. I bet. huh?

840
00:41:18.601 --> 00:41:22.897
- Not really. No. just...
We're keeping it intimate.

841
00:41:26.192 --> 00:41:27.526
- Come on. Davy.

842
00:41:28.944 --> 00:41:30.779
- All right. it's a
couple of hundred people.

843
00:41:30.779 --> 00:41:31.614
(scoffs)

844
00:41:31.614 --> 00:41:35.701
- But Frankie's family's
paying for most of this.

845
00:41:37.828 --> 00:41:39.330
What's the matter?

846
00:41:41.207 --> 00:41:43.792
- I got some issues down
at the station. that's all.

847
00:41:43.792 --> 00:41:44.877
Things I gotta figure out.

848
00:41:44.877 --> 00:41:45.711
- Like what?

849
00:41:45.711 --> 00:41:47.671
- Just things. all right? Just things.

850
00:41:47.671 --> 00:41:48.672
- All right.

851
00:41:54.053 --> 00:41:56.222
- Oh. goddammit. the cold.

852
00:41:57.389 --> 00:41:59.725
- Are you gonna go to the dentist?

853
00:41:59.725 --> 00:42:00.809
- Eventually.

854
00:42:03.562 --> 00:42:04.396
Maybe.

855
00:42:06.106 --> 00:42:08.943
No. No. I'm not gonna pay
thousands for implants.

856
00:42:08.943 --> 00:42:11.695
Remember. flossing will do.

857
00:42:11.695 --> 00:42:15.199
- Sure. floss. that outta take care of it.

858
00:42:18.244 --> 00:42:21.330
- [Police Radio] 342.

Wait.

I knew Fraser would take

871
00:43:08.836 --> 00:43:10.170
- [Davy] But we were closer.

872
00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:12.381
- I don't like to go on domestics.

873
00:43:12.381 --> 00:43:14.883
you can put yourself in
the crap bath in six months

874
00:43:14.883 --> 00:43:17.553
after I've retired. and
at home on the couch.

875
00:43:17.553 --> 00:43:20.306
But right now. no domestics.

876
00:43:20.306 --> 00:43:21.390
- [Waiter] Ready to eat?

877
00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:22.224
- Yeah.

878
00:43:24.893 --> 00:43:27.187
Just get the patty melt.

You like the patty melt?

880
00:43:28.522 --> 00:43:29.815
- Yeah. yeah. patty melt.

881
00:43:29.815 --> 00:43:33.068
- Two patty melts. fries. extra crispy.

882
00:43:34.153 --> 00:43:36.530
but put them on a paper towel to soak up

883
00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:38.824
as much of the grease as possible.

884
00:43:38.824 --> 00:43:39.700
- [Waiter] You got it.

885
00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:40.701
- Thank you.

886
00:43:42.161 --> 00:43:43.829
(sighs)

887
00:43:43.829 --> 00:43:45.414
The arthritis meds?

888
00:43:46.582 --> 00:43:47.750
- No. I ran out of those.

889
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:51.420
this is for the ulcers that
my arthritis meds caused.

890
00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:54.506
and for the other shit that happened.

891
00:43:59.928 --> 00:44:03.015
Did you sign up for that
401k we talked about?

892
00:44:03.015 --> 00:44:03.849
- Yeah.

893
00:44:05.351 --> 00:44:08.937
- Did you make that startup
contribution like we said?

894
00:44:08.937 --> 00:44:10.648
(clears throat)
- Yeah.

895
00:44:10.648 --> 00:44:15.527
- Well. how could you afford
that. with the wedding?

896
00:44:15.527 --> 00:44:17.237
- It was just a couple of hundred bucks.

897
00:44:17.237 --> 00:44:18.739
- That's all you put in?

898
00:44:18.739 --> 00:44:20.866
- I know. I know. you said
make the full contribution

899
00:44:20.866 --> 00:44:23.410
but I know social security
is not gonna be there

900
00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:25.829
when I retire. and I can't
afford it right now. okay?

901
00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:26.955
The wedding is in two weeks.

902
00:44:26.955 --> 00:44:29.750
- Oh yeah. the wedding. you're
gonna go through with it.

903
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:31.627
- What does that mean?

904
00:44:31.627 --> 00:44:32.461
- Nothing.

905
00:44:36.215 --> 00:44:37.216
- Oh my God.

906
00:44:39.677 --> 00:44:42.221
you've never been in love. have you?

907
00:44:42.221 --> 00:44:46.725
- Hey. I'm not talking love
with you. Davy. all right?

908
00:44:48.102 --> 00:44:50.145
What if you change your mind?

909
00:44:50.145 --> 00:44:51.438
- I'm not gonna change my mind.

910
00:44:51.438 --> 00:44:52.272
- You could.

911
00:44:52.272 --> 00:44:54.233
(scoffs)

912
00:44:54.233 --> 00:44:56.026
- I know the way you think.

913
00:44:56.026 --> 00:44:57.986
Isn't you who said if you
don't make any commitments

914
00:44:57.986 --> 00:44:59.863
then you can never be disappointed?

915
00:44:59.863 --> 00:45:00.698
- Uh-hum.

916
00:45:00.698 --> 00:45:03.283
- Yeah. Well. I'm gonna have someone

917
00:45:03.283 --> 00:45:06.412
to spend Saturday nights
with for the rest of my life.

918
00:45:06.412 --> 00:45:09.498
- Hey. I don't spend Saturday
nights alone. lover boy.

919
00:45:09.498 --> 00:45:11.750
(chuckles)

920
00:45:15.546 --> 00:45:17.297
- So. are you coming?

921
00:45:19.174 --> 00:45:21.468
(sighs)

922
00:45:21.468 --> 00:45:25.931
- I don't think I can make
it. weddings are not my thing.

923
00:45:25.931 --> 00:45:27.224
But I'll get you a gift.

924
00:45:27.224 --> 00:45:28.642
- You don't have to give me a gift.

925
00:45:28.642 --> 00:45:30.894
- No. I'll get you a gift.
- Just don't get... (sighs)

926
00:45:30.894 --> 00:45:32.646
Do you wanna see the ring?

927
00:45:32.646 --> 00:45:35.607
- The ring? You bought a ring?

928
00:45:35.607 --> 00:45:38.193
- Of course I bought a
ring. I'm not a savage.

929
00:45:38.193 --> 00:45:43.198
(jazz music playing in the background)

930
00:45:43.365 --> 00:45:45.868
- Wow. how much did that cost?

931
00:45:47.995 --> 00:45:48.829
- Why are you so interested

932
00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:51.582
in the way I spend my
money all of a sudden?

933
00:45:51.582 --> 00:45:56.587
- Money makes people make stupid
fucking decisions. is all.

934
00:45:56.628 --> 00:45:58.797
Like buying rings they can't afford.

935
00:45:58.797 --> 00:46:00.632
- I got a deal.

936
00:46:00.632 --> 00:46:03.552
- Yeah? It looks expensive.

937
00:46:03.552 --> 00:46:06.722
- Man. a two carat diamond
like this. costs upward of...

938
00:46:06.722 --> 00:46:08.557
- I know what rings like that cost.

939
00:46:08.557 --> 00:46:10.517
(Davy scoffs)

940
00:46:10.517 --> 00:46:13.020
You stole $20.000 out
of the evidence locker

941
00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.522
to buy a goddamn wedding ring.

942
00:46:18.525 --> 00:46:19.359
I knew it.

943
00:46:20.194 --> 00:46:21.028
I knew it.

944
00:46:23.197 --> 00:46:25.991
I so wanted you not to be a crook. Davy?

945
00:46:25.991 --> 00:46:28.535
What the fuck were you thinking?

946
00:46:28.535 --> 00:46:31.205
Buying a goddam faggot wedding ring.

947
00:46:31.205 --> 00:46:32.748
- That kind of language is reportable.

948
00:46:32.748 --> 00:46:34.500
- You think?

949
00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:37.920
- I think you need to take
that sensitivity class. Nate.

950
00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:40.422
- You know. they gave me the
job of showing you the ropes

951
00:46:40.422 --> 00:46:42.049
because they thought a hard ass like me

952
00:46:42.049 --> 00:46:45.093
could whip your little ass into giving up.

953
00:46:45.093 --> 00:46:47.721
But I'm a professional. I do my job.

954
00:46:47.721 --> 00:46:49.890
and I don't give a fuck if
you're wearing fishnet underwear.

955
00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:53.227
All I give a fuck is if
you do the job right.

956
00:46:53.227 --> 00:46:56.396
but I can't do anything about this.

957
00:46:56.396 --> 00:46:59.775
You're gonna go down for this. Davy.

958
00:46:59.775 --> 00:47:01.693
- I didn't take the money.

959
00:47:01.693 --> 00:47:04.196
- Well then. how did you
afford a ring like that?

960
00:47:04.196 --> 00:47:05.572
- It was $300.

961
00:47:05.572 --> 00:47:06.615
- A two carat diamond?

962
00:47:06.615 --> 00:47:08.242
- It's zirconium. all right?

963
00:47:08.242 --> 00:47:09.493
The guy told me no one but a jeweler

964
00:47:09.493 --> 00:47:14.081
would be able to tell the
difference. because it works.

965
00:47:18.126 --> 00:47:21.672
- Hey. I think that's the
guy we just got to call on.

966
00:47:21.672 --> 00:47:22.756
- What?

967
00:47:22.756 --> 00:47:27.761
- That Caucasian. 30 something.
red jacket. six foot.

968
00:47:27.970 --> 00:47:30.514
- No. he doesn't look
that tall. red jacket?

969
00:47:30.514 --> 00:47:32.307
- Red jacket.

970
00:47:32.307 --> 00:47:35.310
Step out. get behind him. we'll see.

971
00:47:36.186 --> 00:47:40.065
(indistinct chatter)

972
00:47:40.065 --> 00:47:42.818
(dramatic music)

973
00:47:50.659 --> 00:47:54.746
No. no. no. don't get too close. now Davy.

974
00:47:54.746 --> 00:47:57.499
(dramatic music)

975
00:48:26.403 --> 00:48:28.947
Gun. gun!
(fires)

976
00:48:28.947 --> 00:48:30.198
(body thuds)

977
00:48:30.198 --> 00:48:31.617
- [Kasha] Holy shit.

978
00:48:31.617 --> 00:48:34.995
- But I'm a professional. I do my job.

979
00:48:34.995 --> 00:48:37.623
And I don't give a fuck if
you're wearing fishnet underwear.

980
00:48:37.623 --> 00:48:40.292
all I give a fuck is if
you do the job right.

981
00:48:40.292 --> 00:48:42.753
But I can't do anything about this.

982
00:48:42.753 --> 00:48:45.881
you're gonna go down for this. Davy.

983
00:48:45.881 --> 00:48:48.800
- God. did he get into an accident?

984
00:48:50.093 --> 00:48:54.056
- It was a collision. his
head against the hood.

985
00:48:54.056 --> 00:48:58.644
- Only a jeweler would be
able to tell the difference.

986
00:48:58.644 --> 00:49:01.980
- But he's gonna fix it. I'm sure of it.

987
00:49:04.191 --> 00:49:06.318
- He doesn't look that tall. red jacket?

988
00:49:06.318 --> 00:49:08.111
- Red jacket.

989
00:49:08.111 --> 00:49:10.822
Step out. and get behind him.

990
00:49:10.822 --> 00:49:14.326
- Still drinking your orange juice?

991
00:49:14.326 --> 00:49:16.244
- I put a little vodka.

992
00:49:17.579 --> 00:49:21.041
You know your boyfriend was
really worried about you.

993
00:49:21.041 --> 00:49:23.919
- Ew. he is not my boyfriend.

994
00:49:23.919 --> 00:49:25.170
- She's my niece

995
00:49:25.170 --> 00:49:27.214
- [Kasha] And he can be a pain.

996
00:49:27.214 --> 00:49:31.009
- You are too much. very sexy. Kasha.

997
00:49:31.009 --> 00:49:33.261
Why don't you take a video?

998
00:49:36.098 --> 00:49:38.600
(speaking in foreign language)

999
00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:40.435
I want you to meet my beautiful

1000
00:49:40.435 --> 00:49:41.269
(speaking in foreign language)

1001
00:49:41.269 --> 00:49:43.897
- Hey. you back there.

1002
00:49:43.897 --> 00:49:46.149
Get out of the way. thanks.

1003
00:49:47.359 --> 00:49:49.653
- You know what. take it on my phone.

1004
00:49:49.653 --> 00:49:50.612
- [Nate] Gun. gun!
(fires)

1005
00:49:50.612 --> 00:49:53.281
(gasps)
- Jesus!

1006
00:49:54.908 --> 00:49:56.994
- [Viktor] What the hell?

1007
00:50:01.832 --> 00:50:06.294
- Oh shit. I thought
he was going for a gun.

1008
00:50:06.294 --> 00:50:08.714
- A cell phone. but you were right.

1009
00:50:08.714 --> 00:50:10.132
he was good for that domestic.

1010
00:50:10.132 --> 00:50:11.925
he got a boatload of warrants too.

1011
00:50:11.925 --> 00:50:13.135
- But no gun

1012
00:50:13.135 --> 00:50:13.969
- No gun.

1013
00:50:15.053 --> 00:50:16.680
- And next time you read
somebody their rights.

1014
00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.849
could you man it up a little bit please?

1015
00:50:18.849 --> 00:50:19.766
- Huh?

1016
00:50:19.766 --> 00:50:22.310
- Oh. you have the right to remain silent.

1017
00:50:22.310 --> 00:50:24.438
I mean. could you gay it
up more than that. huh?

1018
00:50:24.438 --> 00:50:27.190
- You know. it's a good thing
I broke your glasses earlier.

1019
00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:30.610
'cause if you could see there
might've been more damage.

1020
00:50:30.610 --> 00:50:32.029
- Well. IAD's gonna come here

1021
00:50:32.029 --> 00:50:33.405
and they're gonna try to
fuck me out of my pension.

1022
00:50:33.405 --> 00:50:36.033
I'm telling you that right now.

1023
00:50:36.033 --> 00:50:39.202
And you're still in deep Davy. right?

1024
00:50:39.202 --> 00:50:41.288
You put these on.

1025
00:50:41.288 --> 00:50:42.539
- Come on. Nate.

1026
00:50:42.539 --> 00:50:46.168
Look I didn't steal
anything. I borrowed it.

1027
00:50:47.085 --> 00:50:47.919
I promise you-

1028
00:50:47.919 --> 00:50:48.754
- Put these on!

1029
00:50:48.754 --> 00:50:49.588
- It'll be back in
there after the wedding.

1030
00:50:49.588 --> 00:50:53.175
- Put them on. I'm tired
of taking shit for you.

1031
00:50:53.175 --> 00:50:55.010
You're all snickering behind my back.

1032
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:57.304
they thought that I was like you.

1033
00:50:57.304 --> 00:50:59.765
but I treated you right. didn't I?

1034
00:50:59.765 --> 00:51:00.849
I did my job.

1035
00:51:03.393 --> 00:51:04.644
What's gonna be my legacy now?

1036
00:51:04.644 --> 00:51:08.648
A goddamn busted shooting
and a crooked partner.

1037
00:51:10.901 --> 00:51:14.905
- Two weeks. I promise it
will be back in the box.

1038
00:51:14.905 --> 00:51:16.406
My wedding gift is a
loan. it will cover it.

1039
00:51:16.406 --> 00:51:19.409
- The grand jury date is tomorrow.

1040
00:51:19.409 --> 00:51:21.244
it's gotta be back tomorrow.

1041
00:51:21.244 --> 00:51:23.038
- Why the hell so soon?

1042
00:51:23.038 --> 00:51:23.872
- I don't know.

1043
00:51:23.872 --> 00:51:27.084
I don't question what
the DA's office is doing.

1044
00:51:27.084 --> 00:51:28.794
But one thing I know for
sure. you're going to jail

1045
00:51:28.794 --> 00:51:32.047
if it's not back there tomorrow morning.

1046
00:51:32.047 --> 00:51:33.757
- I can apologize.

1047
00:51:33.757 --> 00:51:37.552
- Apologize? What. are
you stupid? You idiot.

1048
00:51:37.552 --> 00:51:42.432
You got $20.000 in small bills
you can put in there tonight?

1049
00:51:42.432 --> 00:51:43.600
- No.

1050
00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:47.979
- Bills with cocaine
sprinkled on them. huh?

1051
00:51:47.979 --> 00:51:50.023
Because you know they can test for that.

1052
00:51:50.023 --> 00:51:51.775
- [Dina] Officers?

1053
00:51:51.775 --> 00:51:52.859
- What did you do with the money. Davy?

1054
00:51:52.859 --> 00:51:56.530
What. you spent on that
faggot. gay wedding?

1055
00:51:57.614 --> 00:51:58.448
- No.

1056
00:51:59.407 --> 00:52:01.493
- Well. what then. the ring?

1057
00:52:01.493 --> 00:52:03.620
- I told you. it's zirconium.

1058
00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:07.249
- Then what? What did
you do with the $20.000?

1059
00:52:07.249 --> 00:52:08.917
- It's supposed to be a surprise.

1060
00:52:08.917 --> 00:52:09.835
- Surprise?

1061
00:52:12.337 --> 00:52:14.089
- I bought you teeth.

1062
00:52:15.715 --> 00:52:19.094
(calm music playing)

1063
00:52:19.094 --> 00:52:20.095
- Me? Teeth?

1064
00:52:22.681 --> 00:52:27.352
- Yeah. a retirement present.
and fucking expensive too.

1065
00:52:29.104 --> 00:52:33.400
Implants. crowns. I just
wanted you to be able

1066
00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:36.069
to fucking chew in your old age.

1067
00:52:37.362 --> 00:52:39.614
- Officers.
- Officers.

1068
00:52:39.614 --> 00:52:41.241
- What?
- What?

1069
00:52:41.241 --> 00:52:43.451
- I do people favors.

1070
00:52:43.451 --> 00:52:44.411
- What?

1071
00:52:44.411 --> 00:52:48.790
- $20.000. in small bills.
with a taste of cocaine.

1072
00:52:48.790 --> 00:52:50.250
it's not a big deal.

1073
00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:52.502
- Yes. we do people favors.

1074
00:52:53.837 --> 00:52:57.591
Did you need that tonight
or tomorrow morning?

1075
00:52:57.591 --> 00:53:00.510
(enchanting music)

1076
00:53:06.516 --> 00:53:08.310
- So years ago. I'm buying a car.

1077
00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:09.895
and this old salesman comes out to me

1078
00:53:09.895 --> 00:53:11.730
and I recognize him right off.

1079
00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:14.441
'Cause he was famous from
doing commercials years before.

1080
00:53:14.441 --> 00:53:17.152
you know with the shtick
and the bikini models.

1081
00:53:17.152 --> 00:53:18.361
and the crocodile and the bear.

1082
00:53:18.361 --> 00:53:20.572
you know him if you saw him.

1083
00:53:20.572 --> 00:53:24.409
But I also remembered. that
he was convicted of fraud

1084
00:53:24.409 --> 00:53:27.162
and went to jail. so
I knew he was a crook.

1085
00:53:27.162 --> 00:53:29.372
But I still ended up buying
a car from him anyway

1086
00:53:29.372 --> 00:53:32.292
because he convinced
me it was a great deal.

1087
00:53:32.292 --> 00:53:35.629
Some people. can get away with anything.

1088
00:53:37.505 --> 00:53:39.966
- Are you gonna show that to anyone?

1089
00:53:39.966 --> 00:53:41.718
- Well. you always wanna
upload it to the cloud.

1090
00:53:41.718 --> 00:53:45.555
but I have better things
I can put on YouTube.

1091
00:53:47.057 --> 00:53:49.142
Can I have my phone back?

1092
00:53:50.852 --> 00:53:51.686
Oh.

1093
00:53:54.272 --> 00:53:56.816
(speaking in foreign language)

1094
00:53:56.816 --> 00:53:59.444
- I want you to meet my
beautiful real estate agent.

1095
00:53:59.444 --> 00:54:01.863
- [Kasha] Hey. you back there.

1096
00:54:01.863 --> 00:54:03.990
Yeah. can you get out of the way. please?

1097
00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:04.824
Thanks.

1098
00:54:06.201 --> 00:54:07.702
- You know what. why don't
you take it on my phone?

1099
00:54:07.702 --> 00:54:09.829
- [Nate] Gun. gun. gun!

1100
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:10.872
(gunshot)

1101
00:54:10.872 --> 00:54:12.874
(thuds)

1102
00:54:14.167 --> 00:54:15.502
- What the hell?

1103
00:54:18.296 --> 00:54:20.423
- You okay. partner?

1104
00:54:20.423 --> 00:54:21.424
- Holy shit.

1105
00:54:22.801 --> 00:54:23.635
Hey.

1106
00:54:29.307 --> 00:54:32.978
(enchanting guitar playing)

1107
00:54:51.246 --> 00:54:53.581
- My mother once asked when
I was gonna get married.

1108
00:54:53.581 --> 00:54:55.834
and I said. "When I
meet the perfect girl."

1109
00:54:55.834 --> 00:54:58.295
She said. "Well. I guess
you're never gonna get married.

1110
00:54:58.295 --> 00:55:00.880
'cause the perfect girl is
looking for the perfect guy."

1111
00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:02.173
Thanks mom.

1112
00:55:02.173 --> 00:55:05.343
(phone rings)

1113
00:55:05.343 --> 00:55:06.261
- Bergen's.

1114
00:55:07.345 --> 00:55:08.596
Yeah. but we got a lot of assholes here.

1115
00:55:08.596 --> 00:55:10.932
this one got a name?

1116
00:55:10.932 --> 00:55:12.350
Yeah. he is here.

1117
00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:15.353
One thing. is that life is about choices.

1118
00:55:15.353 --> 00:55:17.063
Now. some choices don't make
a big difference at all.

1119
00:55:17.063 --> 00:55:18.898
Coke. Pepsi. but other choices.

1120
00:55:18.898 --> 00:55:20.942
you gotta live with your entire life.

1121
00:55:20.942 --> 00:55:24.863
But you still have to make the
choice or you have no life.

1122
00:55:24.863 --> 00:55:27.824
It's just making the right
choice. that's so damn hard.

1123
00:55:27.824 --> 00:55:29.159
Phone. good sir.

1124
00:55:31.453 --> 00:55:32.996
Enjoy.

1125
00:55:32.996 --> 00:55:34.122
- Hello?

1126
00:55:34.122 --> 00:55:36.791
- I am a man who believes in karma.

1127
00:55:36.791 --> 00:55:40.337
You do me nice. I'll do the same for you.

1128
00:55:40.337 --> 00:55:42.422
but if you do me wrong...

1129
00:55:42.422 --> 00:55:44.883
- Viktor. I didn't know she
was your girlfriend. man.

1130
00:55:44.883 --> 00:55:48.261
- Kasha? She is not girlfriend.

1131
00:55:48.261 --> 00:55:50.680
she's my niece. she's family.

1132
00:55:51.973 --> 00:55:55.060
And I like my niece. you not so much.

1133
00:55:57.771 --> 00:56:00.523
- You're holding me up for
money for hitting on your niece?

1134
00:56:00.523 --> 00:56:04.778
- Holding you up? You think
I'm that kind of a person?

1135
00:56:04.778 --> 00:56:08.156
The money is not for
me. it's for my friend.

1136
00:56:08.156 --> 00:56:10.617
the real estate agent. Didi.

1137
00:56:10.617 --> 00:56:14.913
You treated her badly
and you damaged her car.

1138
00:56:14.913 --> 00:56:16.956
- But you pounded my head into her hood.

1139
00:56:16.956 --> 00:56:20.335
- But you were responsible.
it was your car.

1140
00:56:20.335 --> 00:56:22.003
you have to pay.

1141
00:56:22.003 --> 00:56:25.173
Please. put the money in
a paper bag. not plastic.

1142
00:56:25.173 --> 00:56:26.966
it's best for animals.

1143
00:56:26.966 --> 00:56:28.802
I will be coming soon.

1144
00:56:29.677 --> 00:56:32.931
Don't disappoint me. do you understand?

1158
00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:33.491
- I have it. I have your money.

1159
00:57:33.491 --> 00:57:36.703
- What money? Is this all about money?

1160
00:57:36.703 --> 00:57:37.537
(sighs)

1161
00:57:37.537 --> 00:57:38.371
- Hi. mom.

1162
00:57:38.371 --> 00:57:39.330
- If it's money you need.

1163
00:57:39.330 --> 00:57:41.541
now. you know your father
and I. we can help out.

1164
00:57:41.541 --> 00:57:45.545
- It's not money. Like I
said. I'm just not ready.

1165
00:57:45.545 --> 00:57:48.631
- You can't just tell her
you will. and then you won't.

1166
00:57:48.631 --> 00:57:52.010
I didn't bring up that kind of person.

1167
00:57:52.010 --> 00:57:54.137
- Maybe it's something psychological.

1168
00:57:54.137 --> 00:57:56.014
- I'm not crazy. dad.

1169
00:57:56.014 --> 00:57:58.433
- Is there a problem in the bedroom?

1170
00:57:58.433 --> 00:58:00.351
- I'm not talking about
my sex life with you.

1171
00:58:00.351 --> 00:58:02.770
- Okay then. talk to your father.

1172
00:58:02.770 --> 00:58:04.731
- Men can have trouble
with erections. Milo.

1173
00:58:04.731 --> 00:58:06.107
at any time of their life.

1174
00:58:06.107 --> 00:58:08.193
- Dad. I can get...

1175
00:58:08.193 --> 00:58:09.903
I can get an erection.

1176
00:58:09.903 --> 00:58:12.113
- Well then. if you can
get an erection. Milo.

1177
00:58:12.113 --> 00:58:13.698
what's the problem. baby. huh?

1178
00:58:13.698 --> 00:58:16.534
- Mom. it's not about sex. The sex is...

1179
00:58:16.534 --> 00:58:17.994
- Where are you. Milo?

1180
00:58:17.994 --> 00:58:21.289
- I'm at Bergen's. having a
drink. working on business.

1181
00:58:21.289 --> 00:58:24.250
- This is something we need
to talk about. face to face.

1182
00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:25.460
- I don't wanna talk about it.

1183
00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:28.463
- Stay there. we're on our way.

1184
00:58:28.463 --> 00:58:29.464
(sighs)

1185
00:58:29.464 --> 00:58:33.051
- Thank you. Jesus. he
can get an erection.

1186
00:58:35.678 --> 00:58:36.513
- Fuck.

1187
00:58:40.183 --> 00:58:42.018
- Do you mind company?

1188
00:58:43.186 --> 00:58:44.854
- I think I'll pass.

1189
00:58:44.854 --> 00:58:49.192
I'm expecting people.
including your friend. Viktor.

1190
00:58:51.402 --> 00:58:52.987
- He can overreact.

1191
00:58:56.991 --> 00:58:57.825
- Okay.

1192
00:58:58.952 --> 00:59:00.370
- It's okay. sit.

1193
00:59:04.207 --> 00:59:07.043
- You look like you needed a beer.

1194
00:59:08.503 --> 00:59:10.672
(sighs contentedly)

1195
00:59:10.672 --> 00:59:12.006
No. no. no. it's okay.

1196
00:59:12.006 --> 00:59:13.049
- You were counting pennies. take it.

1197
00:59:13.049 --> 00:59:16.386
- No. I don't need your
money. It was an experiment.

1198
00:59:16.386 --> 00:59:19.180
- What kind of experiment?

1199
00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:22.183
- Well. men have been taking
care of me my whole life.

1200
00:59:22.183 --> 00:59:26.354
I just wanted to see if I
could make it on my own.

1201
00:59:27.438 --> 00:59:28.273
Thank you.

1202
00:59:29.732 --> 00:59:30.567
Yes.

1203
00:59:35.613 --> 00:59:38.199
You get hungry standing on corners.

1204
00:59:38.199 --> 00:59:41.369
- So how much can you
make. standing on corners?

1205
00:59:41.369 --> 00:59:43.955
- Some people make thousands begging.

1206
00:59:43.955 --> 00:59:46.624
lots more than working a nine to five.

1207
00:59:46.624 --> 00:59:47.709
- [Milo] Standing on corners.

1208
00:59:47.709 --> 00:59:49.961
- Yeah. you just gotta
figure out the right tack.

1209
00:59:49.961 --> 00:59:51.713
and the right corner.

1210
00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:55.091
- It's not gonna be good for a baby.

1211
00:59:55.091 --> 00:59:56.175
- Whose baby?

1212
00:59:58.761 --> 01:00:01.139
Oh.
(chuckles)

1213
01:00:01.139 --> 01:00:03.349
Do I look like that
much of a loser to you?

1214
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:07.437
I'm not homeless or pregnant.
that's just my signage.

1215
01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:08.688
Homeless gets you coin.

1216
01:00:08.688 --> 01:00:11.858
homeless and pregnant gets you paper.

1217
01:00:11.858 --> 01:00:13.693
- So. you're scamming people.

1218
01:00:13.693 --> 01:00:17.530
- Oh. what? Like you
never break the rules?

1219
01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:21.200
- And panhandling. that's your plan

1220
01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:23.286
- Until I catch my break.

1221
01:00:24.579 --> 01:00:28.499
I'm a singer. and a
songwriter. and an actress.

1222
01:00:29.709 --> 01:00:31.544
- It's tough business.

1223
01:00:31.544 --> 01:00:34.714
You gotta be at the right
place. the right time.

1224
01:00:34.714 --> 01:00:37.383
you gotta have talent.

1225
01:00:37.383 --> 01:00:39.969
- What makes you think I don't?

1226
01:00:39.969 --> 01:00:42.889
- I don't mean to say you're not talented.

1227
01:00:42.889 --> 01:00:45.391
you're probably very talented.

1228
01:00:46.601 --> 01:00:48.853
You've got the look.

1229
01:00:48.853 --> 01:00:49.687
- Uh-hum.

1230
01:00:51.147 --> 01:00:54.067
And what is it you like looking at?

1231
01:00:55.777 --> 01:00:57.195
- I'm not going there.

1232
01:00:57.195 --> 01:00:58.363
- Going where?

1233
01:01:00.073 --> 01:01:02.492
(phone buzzes)

1234
01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:05.036
(sighs)

1235
01:01:05.036 --> 01:01:05.870
They're on their way.

1236
01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:06.704
- Who?

1237
01:01:08.414 --> 01:01:09.832
- My mom and dad.

1238
01:01:14.962 --> 01:01:18.174
Yeah. I'm always talking to
them in uppercase letters.

1239
01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:22.220
everything is loud. I have to tone down.

1240
01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:25.598
- What message were you
trying to get across?

1241
01:01:25.598 --> 01:01:26.766
- I'm engaged.

1242
01:01:29.018 --> 01:01:31.479
The wedding is in two weeks.

1243
01:01:31.479 --> 01:01:32.980
- Congratulations.

1244
01:01:34.565 --> 01:01:38.403
- Don't congratulate
me. I'm breaking it off.

1245
01:01:38.403 --> 01:01:41.614
And my parents are not happy about it.

1246
01:01:41.614 --> 01:01:42.448
- Sorry.

1247
01:01:43.658 --> 01:01:46.744
- Don't be. it's the right thing to do.

1248
01:01:46.744 --> 01:01:48.079
- What happened?

1249
01:01:49.914 --> 01:01:50.748
(sighs)

1250
01:01:50.748 --> 01:01:55.461
- Nothing happened. I just
don't think she's one.

1251
01:01:55.461 --> 01:01:57.964
- How long have you been going together?

1252
01:01:57.964 --> 01:01:58.881
- 10 years.

1253
01:02:00.591 --> 01:02:03.886
- What? It took you 10 years to figure out

1254
01:02:03.886 --> 01:02:05.888
she's not the one.

1255
01:02:05.888 --> 01:02:07.598
- Is this is a rehearsal
for what my mother will say?

1256
01:02:07.598 --> 01:02:08.766
- No. no. but.

1257
01:02:10.351 --> 01:02:13.813
you're probably gonna fuck this girl up.

1258
01:02:13.813 --> 01:02:14.647
- She'll bounce back.

1259
01:02:14.647 --> 01:02:17.483
(sneering)

1260
01:02:17.483 --> 01:02:20.027
- How did you let it get that far?

1261
01:02:20.027 --> 01:02:23.364
- She was always the girlfriend. steady.

1262
01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:27.118
the one I took to the prom.

1263
01:02:27.118 --> 01:02:28.911
(enchanting music playing)

1264
01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:32.331
I still remember. she wore this backless.

1265
01:02:32.331 --> 01:02:34.167
strapless. blue thing.

1266
01:02:37.795 --> 01:02:40.381
After high school we
both went separate ways.

1267
01:02:40.381 --> 01:02:43.384
different colleges. different towns.

1268
01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:47.805
Years ago. we made a vow that
if neither of us were married

1269
01:02:47.805 --> 01:02:51.267
by the time we were 30.
we would marry each other.

1270
01:02:51.267 --> 01:02:53.060
(chuckles)

1271
01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:54.395
That was stupid.

1272
01:02:56.481 --> 01:03:00.026
But every now and then we bring it up.

1273
01:03:00.026 --> 01:03:01.861
just joking. you know?

1274
01:03:03.863 --> 01:03:08.785
Last month she turned 30. and
when she brought it up again.

1275
01:03:11.204 --> 01:03:12.914
(moaning)
- You wanna get married?

1276
01:03:12.914 --> 01:03:15.958
- Yeah.
(moaning)

1277
01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:16.876
- Romantic.

1278
01:03:20.087 --> 01:03:21.214
- You know when you meet a girl.

1279
01:03:21.214 --> 01:03:22.507
and you bring her home to mom and dad.

1280
01:03:22.507 --> 01:03:25.134
you want them to like her.

1281
01:03:25.134 --> 01:03:27.345
My parents. they love Evie.

1282
01:03:30.431 --> 01:03:34.268
They say when you meet
the right one you know.

1283
01:03:35.186 --> 01:03:38.856
I don't know. so I'm
thinking it's not love.

1284
01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:43.611
- Maybe you just like to fuck around.

1285
01:03:43.611 --> 01:03:45.571
There's nothing wrong
with that. just admit it.

1286
01:03:45.571 --> 01:03:48.658
- No. it's not... I mean. yes. but...

1287
01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:51.619
I just think it is time to settle down.

1288
01:03:51.619 --> 01:03:55.748
- Oh. who's that talking now? Your mother?

1289
01:03:55.748 --> 01:03:58.501
- What if Evie is the right one?

1290
01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:01.087
And I'm just too dense to figure it out.

1291
01:04:01.087 --> 01:04:02.338
- Mh-hm.
- I don't know.

1292
01:04:02.338 --> 01:04:04.882
- Bullshit. you know.

1293
01:04:04.882 --> 01:04:08.636
There has gotta be something
that turns you off.

1294
01:04:08.636 --> 01:04:09.554
what is it?

1295
01:04:11.889 --> 01:04:15.685
- You know. I don't really know you.

1296
01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:19.438
I really don't wanna
talk about this anymore.

1297
01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:26.654
- Like it?

1298
01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:29.407
- Beautiful.

1299
01:04:29.407 --> 01:04:31.909
- Thanks. I love nice jewelry.

1300
01:04:33.077 --> 01:04:34.829
It's expensive. I could live for a year

1301
01:04:34.829 --> 01:04:36.664
off of what this cost.

1302
01:04:38.207 --> 01:04:39.709
- A gift from a boyfriend.

1303
01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:41.127
- No. I stole it.

1304
01:04:42.461 --> 01:04:45.047
from my aunt.
(chuckles)

1305
01:04:45.047 --> 01:04:46.173
She never missed it.

1306
01:04:46.173 --> 01:04:47.466
You know. some people have too much money

1307
01:04:47.466 --> 01:04:49.218
and too much jewelry.

1308
01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:55.725
I was raped when I was 16.

1309
01:05:00.605 --> 01:05:01.606
- I'm sorry.

1310
01:05:03.858 --> 01:05:05.067
I don't know what to say.

1311
01:05:05.067 --> 01:05:09.363
- You don't have say
anything. I'm over it.

1312
01:05:09.363 --> 01:05:10.489
Well. I'm not over it.

1313
01:05:10.489 --> 01:05:14.076
but at least I didn't
turn gay or celibate.

1314
01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:19.957
So what is it that you
don't wanna talk about?

1315
01:05:25.588 --> 01:05:27.256
Come on. talk to me.

1316
01:05:29.550 --> 01:05:33.638
It'll be good to get what's inside. out.

1317
01:05:33.638 --> 01:05:34.722
- Okay.

1318
01:05:34.722 --> 01:05:35.556
- Yeah.

1319
01:05:39.644 --> 01:05:43.230
- What bothers me about
Evie. she's freaky.

1320
01:05:46.442 --> 01:05:48.569
- Oh. kinky sex?

1321
01:05:48.569 --> 01:05:51.739
- No. I'm not talking about this with you.

1322
01:05:51.739 --> 01:05:53.783
- Oh. I touched a nerve there. did I?

1323
01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:56.869
- No. the sex is okay. It's not that.

1324
01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:00.122
- Then what is it?

1325
01:06:02.917 --> 01:06:05.294
- She doesn't like to kiss.

1326
01:06:05.294 --> 01:06:06.587
- That's it?

1327
01:06:06.587 --> 01:06:10.007
- And her mouth doesn't go anywhere else.

1328
01:06:11.717 --> 01:06:14.053
- Oh. so you're gonna tell your parents

1329
01:06:14.053 --> 01:06:15.346
that you're breaking off an engagement

1330
01:06:15.346 --> 01:06:17.056
because she won't go down on you.

1331
01:06:17.056 --> 01:06:18.057
(chuckles)

1332
01:06:18.057 --> 01:06:21.435
- No. that's not what I'm gonna say.

1333
01:06:21.435 --> 01:06:24.355
And that's not it. it's other stuff too.

1334
01:06:24.355 --> 01:06:26.107
- Like what?

1335
01:06:26.107 --> 01:06:30.111
- I've written poetry.
like raps to other girls.

1336
01:06:32.196 --> 01:06:33.864
I've never written her one.

1337
01:06:33.864 --> 01:06:35.449
- So write one.

1338
01:06:35.449 --> 01:06:37.326
- I'm not inspired.

1339
01:06:37.326 --> 01:06:41.580
- Okay. So if you can't
say it. rap it. or kiss it.

1340
01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:47.294
maybe it isn't love.

1341
01:06:47.294 --> 01:06:51.966
But what are you gonna tell
her after 10 years of waiting?

1342
01:06:51.966 --> 01:06:52.800
- You're not helping.

1343
01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:54.635
- I'm just being real.

1344
01:06:56.095 --> 01:06:58.389
Now. if we could get her to hate you

1345
01:06:58.389 --> 01:06:59.849
for something other than ruining

1346
01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:02.685
the happiest moment of her life...

1347
01:07:05.146 --> 01:07:07.815
(phone buzzing)

1348
01:07:09.108 --> 01:07:10.693
Is that them?

1349
01:07:10.693 --> 01:07:12.945
- Yep. they're parking now.

1350
01:07:14.488 --> 01:07:16.490
Shit. Evie's coming too.

1351
01:07:18.534 --> 01:07:23.539
- Oh okay. um. let me clean
this place up a bit for you.

1352
01:07:23.789 --> 01:07:25.374
- No. don't bother.

1353
01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:30.713
- Good luck.

1354
01:07:33.674 --> 01:07:37.928
(enchanting guitar playing)

1355
01:07:37.928 --> 01:07:38.929
- I didn't want it to be like this.

1356
01:07:38.929 --> 01:07:40.806
I just... One step at a time!

1357
01:07:40.806 --> 01:07:42.308
- She has a dress. I have a dress.

1358
01:07:42.308 --> 01:07:44.518
we have people coming from out of state.

1359
01:07:44.518 --> 01:07:46.145
- When were you going to tell me?

1360
01:07:46.145 --> 01:07:49.982
- I understand marriage
responsibility. it's scary.

1361
01:07:49.982 --> 01:07:52.318
- People have plane
tickets. non-refundable.

1362
01:07:52.318 --> 01:07:53.527
- If it's something I did.

1363
01:07:53.527 --> 01:07:55.154
- No. nothing like that.

1364
01:07:55.154 --> 01:07:57.448
- I didn't do anything
wrong other than love you.

1365
01:07:57.448 --> 01:07:59.575
- It's me. not you. I'm just not sure.

1366
01:07:59.575 --> 01:08:00.659
- You've got dozens of girls

1367
01:08:00.659 --> 01:08:02.578
and you always come back to Evie.

1368
01:08:02.578 --> 01:08:05.498
- Just tell me. what is it. really?

1369
01:08:06.791 --> 01:08:08.334
- I can't write you poetry.

1370
01:08:08.334 --> 01:08:11.003
- Are you nuts? They
have homework for that.

1371
01:08:11.003 --> 01:08:13.964
- Okay. so you're not a poet.
but we're good for each other.

1372
01:08:13.964 --> 01:08:16.008
- I just think we're rushing into this.

1373
01:08:16.008 --> 01:08:17.134
I think we should wait.

1374
01:08:17.134 --> 01:08:20.095
- It took you three weeks
to pick out napkin rings.

1375
01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:22.223
and you think we're rushing?

1376
01:08:22.223 --> 01:08:25.768
- I thought we could take
a trip to Vegas or Hawaii.

1377
01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:26.852
sort it all out.

1378
01:08:26.852 --> 01:08:30.064
- You think you can dis-invite 200 people

1379
01:08:30.064 --> 01:08:32.398
and Evie's gonna wait?

1380
01:08:32.398 --> 01:08:35.736
- I wanna be with you. but I can't wait.

1381
01:08:38.823 --> 01:08:41.908
- Please. don't make it now or never.

1382
01:08:43.994 --> 01:08:47.372
- You think you have a lot
of time for choices. Milo.

1383
01:08:47.372 --> 01:08:51.252
sometimes you only have a
moment to make the right one.

1384
01:08:51.252 --> 01:08:54.337
- We were teenagers at prom.

1385
01:08:54.337 --> 01:08:58.217
and it was a night. a
first for the both of us.

1386
01:08:58.217 --> 01:09:02.971
And we were both nervous and
awkward. but then we kissed.

1387
01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:09.310
and it was more than just a kiss.

1388
01:09:09.310 --> 01:09:12.481
You felt it then. and you know it now.

1389
01:09:15.651 --> 01:09:17.653
Milo. it's now or never.

1390
01:09:19.572 --> 01:09:21.407
Do you love me or not?

1391
01:09:33.335 --> 01:09:34.253
- Yes. yes.

1392
01:09:49.559 --> 01:09:52.146
♪ Get me a girl in skintight jeans ♪

1393
01:09:52.146 --> 01:09:55.816

1394
01:09:57.735 --> 01:09:58.903

01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:16.879
I'm Courtney. Milo. has
told me so much about you.

1398
01:10:17.838 --> 01:10:19.924
(scoffs)

1399
01:10:22.968 --> 01:10:25.387
There you go. problem solved.

1400
01:10:25.387 --> 01:10:28.724
- Evie. I can explain. she's an actress.

1401
01:10:31.977 --> 01:10:35.397
- Now. there is a mischief maker for you.

1402
01:10:38.484 --> 01:10:40.193
(chuckles)

1403
01:10:40.193 --> 01:10:42.529
Don't forget your doggy bag.

1404
01:10:52.081 --> 01:10:54.458
We all want a devil for under the sheets.

1405
01:10:54.458 --> 01:10:56.377
Saints? For dashboards.

1406
01:10:57.670 --> 01:11:00.089
Is it because life is basically so boring

1407
01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:02.716
that we need people
like her to spice it up?

1408
01:11:02.716 --> 01:11:04.718
'Cause I know you can
find joy in doing things

1409
01:11:04.718 --> 01:11:05.803
you're not supposed to do.

1410
01:11:05.803 --> 01:11:09.056
but sometimes there's the devil to pay.

1411
01:11:12.226 --> 01:11:15.312
(calm music playing)

1412
01:11:30.452 --> 01:11:32.454
- All right. let's lock it up.

1413
01:11:32.454 --> 01:11:33.789
- Will do. boss.

1414
01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:39.169
(door shuts)

1415
01:11:51.849 --> 01:11:52.683
What?

1416
01:11:54.559 --> 01:11:55.894
Go ahead. judge.

1417
01:11:58.522 --> 01:12:02.443
You can love me. you can
hate me. I don't care.

1418
01:12:03.693 --> 01:12:05.612
I just wanna feel good.

1419
01:12:08.699 --> 01:12:13.370
For just a few minutes. feel
good about myself. my life.

1420
01:12:15.289 --> 01:12:19.626
'cause it's easy to feel
good if you've got money.

1421
01:12:19.626 --> 01:12:23.547
love. sex. family. I haven't
got any of those things.

1422
01:12:23.547 --> 01:12:24.548
All I got...

1423
01:12:28.469 --> 01:12:29.928
And I bet looking down on me

1424
01:12:29.928 --> 01:12:33.474
makes you feel pretty good
about yourself. doesn't it?

1425
01:12:33.474 --> 01:12:34.850
Because no matter how bad it gets for you

1426
01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:38.145
you can always say. at
least I'm not that guy.

1427
01:12:38.145 --> 01:12:40.397
at least I'm not a druggie.

1428
01:12:44.276 --> 01:12:45.693
The way I see it.

1429
01:12:46.987 --> 01:12:49.239
I'm doing a public service.

1430
01:12:55.871 --> 01:12:58.540
(siren wailing)

1431
01:13:02.335 --> 01:13:04.380
- [Man On Radio] Go ahead.

1432
01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:06.799
(door opens)

1433
01:13:08.175 --> 01:13:09.468
- [Paramedic] How long has he been down?

1434
01:13:09.468 --> 01:13:11.553
- I'm not sure. I came back
because I forgot something

1435
01:13:11.553 --> 01:13:12.971
and I found him right there.

1436
01:13:12.971 --> 01:13:13.806
- [Paramedic] Is he breathing?

1437
01:13:13.806 --> 01:13:15.724
- [Murray] I don't know

1438
01:13:22.523 --> 01:13:24.400
- Hey. what's going on?

1439
01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:27.152
(dramatic music)

1440
01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:30.239
What happened?

1441
01:13:31.698 --> 01:13:32.950
- [Nana] Jacob?

1442
01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:35.494
- Hello?

1443
01:13:39.039 --> 01:13:41.541
I'm sorry ma'am. we're closed.

1444
01:13:46.839 --> 01:13:48.507
- Hello. sweetheart.

1445
01:14:00.352 --> 01:14:02.646
Don't be scared. Jacob. Sit.

1446
01:14:08.861 --> 01:14:11.362
- You look just like my nana.

1447
01:14:11.362 --> 01:14:12.990
- Yeah.

1448
01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:15.242
- I'm sorry. this is weird.

1449
01:14:16.452 --> 01:14:17.577
I'm stoned

1450
01:14:17.577 --> 01:14:20.414
- No. it's all right. I am your nana.

1451
01:14:20.414 --> 01:14:21.540
- [Speed] You're not my nana.

1452
01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:24.626
- Not your Nana? Who else would I be?

1453
01:14:25.585 --> 01:14:27.880
- We buried her. I was at her funeral.

1454
01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:32.718
- Yeah. I know. And everybody
had such nice things to say.

1455
01:14:34.594 --> 01:14:38.764
even your cousin. Joey. he never
had a nice word for anybody

1456
01:14:38.764 --> 01:14:40.434
- Lady. who are you?

1457
01:14:43.061 --> 01:14:44.353
- I'm your nana.

1458
01:14:47.065 --> 01:14:49.568
- Oh my God. Nana.
(chuckling)

1459
01:14:49.568 --> 01:14:52.404
Who did we bury? I'll go tell mom.

1460
01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:58.076
- I'm the nana. whose chocolate
chipped cookies you loved.

1461
01:14:58.076 --> 01:15:00.996
the soft gluey ones. huh?

1462
01:15:00.996 --> 01:15:04.500
Who bought you your graduation suit?

1463
01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:09.004
Or worried about that big.
red birthmark on your tush.

1464
01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:13.800
- I gotta go call mom.

1465
01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:16.803
- All right. Jacob. I'm not
gonna beat around the bush.

1466
01:15:16.803 --> 01:15:17.638
(Speed stammering)

1467
01:15:17.638 --> 01:15:19.306
- [Speed] Look. I'll call her.

1468
01:15:19.306 --> 01:15:20.139
- Jacob?

1469
01:15:21.058 --> 01:15:23.809
(dramatic music)

1470
01:15:25.853 --> 01:15:28.106
Who the hell are you?

1471
01:15:28.106 --> 01:15:31.860
- Hell? No. that's not
me. I'm not from hell.

1472
01:15:34.071 --> 01:15:35.489
There is no hell.

1473
01:15:37.241 --> 01:15:40.994
But like I said. I'll
get right to the point.

1474
01:15:42.496 --> 01:15:44.581
without being mysterious.

1475
01:15:51.046 --> 01:15:52.047
You're dead.

1476
01:15:53.173 --> 01:15:54.675
- What?

1477
01:15:54.675 --> 01:15:57.219
- Right now you'll
probably think you're high.

1478
01:15:57.219 --> 01:15:58.554
but you're dead.

1479
01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:01.181
They'll be bringing your body

1480
01:16:01.181 --> 01:16:04.309
out of the restroom momentarily.

1481
01:16:04.309 --> 01:16:07.353
- Ugh. what a day this has been.

1482
01:16:07.353 --> 01:16:11.817
An hour ago. this lady
on a train in St. Louis.

1483
01:16:11.817 --> 01:16:13.318
she drops dead.

1484
01:16:13.318 --> 01:16:15.821
I was in such a rush I
didn't have time to eat.

1485
01:16:15.821 --> 01:16:20.576
She was young. 50. but she
had family history. you know

1486
01:16:20.576 --> 01:16:22.661
high blood pressure. diabetes.

1487
01:16:22.661 --> 01:16:25.205
she has a time bomb. she just went off.

1488
01:16:25.205 --> 01:16:27.958
So I had to get to her first. but you.

1489
01:16:27.958 --> 01:16:30.919
we had a whole team on
standby waiting for you.

1490
01:16:30.919 --> 01:16:34.339
for a long. long time. you were expected.

1491
01:16:36.383 --> 01:16:37.800
I don't know. Jacob.

1492
01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:40.637
a lot of people went way
out of their way for you.

1493
01:16:40.637 --> 01:16:42.973
They gave love. money. time.

1494
01:16:45.559 --> 01:16:49.396
we all thought you're
gonna clean up your act.

1495
01:16:52.773 --> 01:16:55.277
- No. no. no. no. this is fucked.

1496
01:16:55.277 --> 01:16:59.072
- Jacob. where'd you learn such language?

1497
01:16:59.072 --> 01:17:03.744
You don't talk like that
to your nana. to anybody.

1498
01:17:03.744 --> 01:17:04.745
- Fuck.

1499
01:17:04.745 --> 01:17:06.788
- Your nana's right.
the word is offensive.

1500
01:17:06.788 --> 01:17:10.250
So let's begin again.
and you needn't worry.

1501
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:14.212
I'm not that grim reaper
they show in the movies.

1502
01:17:14.212 --> 01:17:16.048
what a joke.

1503
01:17:16.048 --> 01:17:17.466
- This is a joke.

1504
01:17:21.511 --> 01:17:24.014
- I don't joke. I'm not funny.

1505
01:17:27.142 --> 01:17:29.394
It's only that I've found over the years.

1506
01:17:29.394 --> 01:17:33.940
that it's best to first
put my subjects at ease.

1507
01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:34.858
- Subjects?

1508
01:17:35.776 --> 01:17:36.818
- Of all your family.

1509
01:17:36.818 --> 01:17:41.239
you've always felt most
comfortable with your nana.

1510
01:17:41.239 --> 01:17:44.493
a so lovely woman. good heart.

1511
01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:46.827
dreadful taste in perfume.

1512
01:17:46.827 --> 01:17:50.040
- I just wanna know what's
going on here. okay?

1513
01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:51.833
- Go see for yourself.

1514
01:17:59.049 --> 01:18:00.967
(suspenseful music)

1515
01:18:00.967 --> 01:18:03.553
- [Paramedics] One. two. three.

1516
01:18:05.263 --> 01:18:08.517
(somber music playing)

1517
01:18:19.027 --> 01:18:21.947
(door creaks open)

1518
01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:37.295
- Nana?

1519
01:18:48.974 --> 01:18:50.225
- Such a shame.

1520
01:18:55.856 --> 01:18:58.692
You want a sprinkled fried chicken?

1521
01:18:58.692 --> 01:19:00.943
They put a little honey in the butter.

1522
01:19:00.943 --> 01:19:03.196
like the kind I used to make.

1523
01:19:03.196 --> 01:19:05.615
(indistinct)

1524
01:19:10.871 --> 01:19:13.457
- All they had open was espino.

1525
01:19:14.833 --> 01:19:17.252
it's not my favorite.

1526
01:19:17.252 --> 01:19:20.297
- I was just trying to get a little high.

1527
01:19:20.297 --> 01:19:21.298
Oh. come on.

1528
01:19:25.802 --> 01:19:29.681
- Jacob. I know it's all very disturbing.

1529
01:19:29.681 --> 01:19:31.850
but what can you do?

1530
01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:35.228
We thought you'd grow out of it.

1531
01:19:35.228 --> 01:19:40.108
we thought you'd grow up
be a mitch. but you didn't.

1532
01:19:40.108 --> 01:19:43.528
And you know what you left behind? Guilt.

1533
01:19:46.114 --> 01:19:47.907
Everybody who loved you

1534
01:19:47.907 --> 01:19:51.452
they're now wondering if
they could have done more.

1535
01:19:51.452 --> 01:19:53.830
What could we have done?

1536
01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:55.707
You aren't our little guy anymore.

1537
01:19:55.707 --> 01:19:58.960
where we could tell you not
to put things in your mouth.

1538
01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:02.880
And I heard you say you
had no love. no family.

1539
01:20:04.049 --> 01:20:07.302
you had both. you just slapped us away.

1540
01:20:12.808 --> 01:20:14.309
- I'm sorry. nana.

1541
01:20:18.271 --> 01:20:19.689
I didn't mean it.

1542
01:20:23.735 --> 01:20:25.320
I can change.

1543
01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:27.239
(scoffs)

1544
01:20:27.239 --> 01:20:31.034
- No. no. no. no. no. no.
I want my nana. not you.

1545
01:20:31.034 --> 01:20:34.538
- You can't always have what you want.

1546
01:20:34.538 --> 01:20:38.959
You get one life. Jacob.
like most you squandered it.

1547
01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:44.380
Most deaths are by suicide you know.

1548
01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:46.508
we don't believe it but it's true.

1549
01:20:46.508 --> 01:20:50.219
Quick with a gun. a bit
slower with a needle.

1550
01:20:51.721 --> 01:20:54.766
and sometimes they take years.

1551
01:20:54.766 --> 01:20:57.519
It's suicide by too much.

1552
01:20:57.519 --> 01:21:01.064
too much smoking. too much drinking.

1553
01:21:01.064 --> 01:21:03.817
We all know that death
is inevitable but...

1554
01:21:03.817 --> 01:21:05.986
I had this young fellow last week.

1555
01:21:05.986 --> 01:21:10.740
he went on and on about
how he was a vegetarian.

1556
01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:14.244
like broccoli has the key to immortality.

1557
01:21:14.244 --> 01:21:15.829
a really cocky guy.

1558
01:21:18.248 --> 01:21:20.500
- So there's no going back.

1559
01:21:23.753 --> 01:21:28.717
- Jacob. you always had a
good head on your shoulders.

1560
01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:30.760
but not any smart.

1561
01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:34.514
You understand what's going on
here. with this is all about?

1562
01:21:34.514 --> 01:21:37.183
Of course there's no going back.

1563
01:21:39.184 --> 01:21:41.271
I hate it when they ask that.

1564
01:21:41.271 --> 01:21:45.442
that vegetarian just wouldn't come along.

1565
01:21:45.442 --> 01:21:47.986
- Did he have a choice?

1566
01:21:47.986 --> 01:21:48.820
No. no. no. no.

1567
01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:51.489
I don't wanna talk to that
other woman please. just you.

1568
01:21:51.489 --> 01:21:56.327
- Jacob. even your nana likes
to put on a little lipstick.

1569
01:21:58.538 --> 01:22:02.834
- So I have a choice. I don't have to die.

1570
01:22:02.834 --> 01:22:05.253
- You like this color?

1571
01:22:05.253 --> 01:22:09.049
(speaking in foreign language)

1572
01:22:09.049 --> 01:22:11.718
Of course you'll have to die.

1573
01:22:11.718 --> 01:22:13.386
everyone has to die.

1574
01:22:14.304 --> 01:22:15.847
- But that guy. the vegetarian.

1575
01:22:15.847 --> 01:22:16.889
you said he wouldn't come along.

1576
01:22:16.889 --> 01:22:19.601
So what'd you do? Did you drag him out?

1577
01:22:19.601 --> 01:22:21.102
Take him to heaven. hell?

1578
01:22:21.102 --> 01:22:25.190
- I told you. there is no
hell. no heaven either.

1579
01:22:26.066 --> 01:22:27.651
- So what is there?

1580
01:22:29.152 --> 01:22:32.237
- Well. there's always fried chicken.

1581
01:22:35.825 --> 01:22:39.287
You people. you always
lose your sense of humor

1582
01:22:39.287 --> 01:22:40.956
in times like these.

1583
01:22:42.707 --> 01:22:43.541
Let's go.

1584
01:22:47.003 --> 01:22:49.089
- I'm not going anywhere.

1585
01:22:51.466 --> 01:22:52.592
(exclaiming excitedly)

1586
01:22:52.592 --> 01:22:53.843
Maybe I'm okay.

1587
01:22:56.304 --> 01:22:57.889
- Nope.

1588
01:22:57.889 --> 01:22:59.391
- How do you know?

1589
01:23:01.393 --> 01:23:04.145
- Who figures he'd die in my bar.

1590
01:23:05.146 --> 01:23:06.439
- You coming?

1591
01:23:06.439 --> 01:23:09.025
(upbeat music)

1592
01:23:10.735 --> 01:23:13.279
- Jacob. do you remember I told you

1593
01:23:13.279 --> 01:23:15.448
I used to be off a hoofer.

1594
01:23:17.575 --> 01:23:21.996
I did Broadway once when I
was 19. "West Side Story".

1595
01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:26.418
"The Chorus". (indistinct)

1596
01:23:26.418 --> 01:23:28.335
Oh. that was something.

1597
01:23:30.130 --> 01:23:32.298
But then I met you grandfather.

1598
01:23:32.298 --> 01:23:35.719
and family became another career.

1599
01:23:35.719 --> 01:23:38.471
But I was so disappointed in you.

1600
01:23:40.557 --> 01:23:42.642
- The drugs. the alcohol?

1601
01:23:42.642 --> 01:23:45.937
Well. yeah. but I was disappointed

1602
01:23:45.937 --> 01:23:50.525
because you never let me
teach you how to dance.

1603
01:23:50.525 --> 01:23:52.610
- I know how to dance.

1604
01:23:52.610 --> 01:23:56.281
- What. the gyrating business?
Where nobody touches.

1605
01:23:56.281 --> 01:23:58.867
(upbeat music)

1606
01:24:02.327 --> 01:24:03.913
Look how sexy I am.

1607
01:24:06.332 --> 01:24:09.544
That's not dancing. it's a show.

1608
01:24:09.544 --> 01:24:13.798
Dancing. real dancing. is
two people. hand in hand.

1609
01:24:14.674 --> 01:24:16.593
It's a tandem.

1610
01:24:16.593 --> 01:24:17.594
(enchanting music)

1611
01:24:17.594 --> 01:24:19.471
and it's romantic.

1612
01:24:19.471 --> 01:24:22.849
If you danced. really danced with a girl.

1613
01:24:22.849 --> 01:24:25.309
maybe you'd have a girl.

1614
01:24:25.309 --> 01:24:28.688
maybe things would have
turned out different.

1615
01:24:28.688 --> 01:24:30.732
Dance with me. Jacob.

1616
01:24:30.732 --> 01:24:33.651
(enchanting music)

1617
01:24:41.409 --> 01:24:45.914
- Oh Jacob. I want you to
be happy with this business.

1618
01:24:46.956 --> 01:24:48.041
- Happy?

1619
01:24:48.041 --> 01:24:49.416
- Sure.

1620
01:24:49.416 --> 01:24:52.796
- Why would I be happy to be dead?

1621
01:24:52.796 --> 01:24:56.299
- Well. for some it's better than life.

1622
01:24:56.299 --> 01:24:59.469
- But I don't wanna be
dead. I have a girlfriend.

1623
01:24:59.469 --> 01:25:01.596
we were gonna have kids.

1624
01:25:01.596 --> 01:25:04.849
- Now. I know you haven't a girlfriend.

1625
01:25:05.892 --> 01:25:07.977
I'm death. I know things.

1626
01:25:10.230 --> 01:25:13.691
But. if you wanna tango with death.

1627
01:25:13.691 --> 01:25:16.277
(upbeat music)

1628
01:25:21.491 --> 01:25:23.034
- I never traveled much.

1629
01:25:23.034 --> 01:25:24.827
there's a lot of places
I never got to see.

1630
01:25:24.827 --> 01:25:27.121
- If you lived to be 100.
they'd be places you would say

1631
01:25:27.121 --> 01:25:29.249
you didn't get to see. that's life.

1632
01:25:29.249 --> 01:25:31.166
it's always incomplete.

1633
01:25:35.421 --> 01:25:37.298
- But for some people. like me.

1634
01:25:37.298 --> 01:25:40.093
it's more incomplete than ever.

1635
01:25:40.093 --> 01:25:41.511
- Don't get me wrong.

1636
01:25:41.511 --> 01:25:46.099
I commiserate. but the death
was your choice. not mine.

1637
01:25:47.142 --> 01:25:48.351
- I didn't plan it.

1638
01:25:48.351 --> 01:25:51.938
- Oh. come on. you're not
dumb. you knew the risks.

1639
01:25:51.938 --> 01:25:55.608
It's not like you tripped
in front of a bus.

1640
01:25:56.609 --> 01:25:58.443
- I can't just take all
the moments of my life

1641
01:25:58.443 --> 01:26:01.865
and put them in a box. and pick just one.

1642
01:26:05.034 --> 01:26:06.702
There's some things I had no control over.

1643
01:26:06.702 --> 01:26:10.039
and that should count for something.

1644
01:26:10.039 --> 01:26:11.541
Let's make a deal.

1645
01:26:13.041 --> 01:26:17.505
- Well. I'm sorry. it
doesn't work that way.

1646
01:26:17.505 --> 01:26:19.299
It's time to go.

1647
01:26:19.299 --> 01:26:22.677
(dramatic music)

1648
01:26:22.677 --> 01:26:25.305
- No. no. no. no. no. no. wait.

1649
01:26:25.305 --> 01:26:30.309
I deserve a second chance.
you can change the future.

1650
01:26:30.518 --> 01:26:34.105
I may not be perfect.
but let me try again.

1651
01:26:35.273 --> 01:26:39.693
- I'm sorry. I have other
appointments. other people.

1652
01:26:40.612 --> 01:26:43.948
I can't argue with you forever.

1653
01:26:43.948 --> 01:26:46.409
- Where are you going?

1654
01:26:46.409 --> 01:26:48.995
- Nolan's. guns make busy work.

1655
01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:58.213
It's ironic. you seem to
have spent your entire life

1656
01:27:00.130 --> 01:27:03.134
trying to avoid the real world.

1657
01:27:03.134 --> 01:27:07.472
always looking to go somewhere.
and you knew not where.

1658
01:27:07.472 --> 01:27:10.975
and now I wanna take you to another world.

1659
01:27:12.143 --> 01:27:13.853
and you don't wanna go.

1660
01:27:13.853 --> 01:27:16.356
(door creaks)

1661
01:27:16.356 --> 01:27:20.443
Well. I'm looking forward
to some good jambalaya.

1662
01:27:21.778 --> 01:27:24.530
(whooshing)

1663
01:27:24.530 --> 01:27:27.450
(enchanting music)

1664
01:27:29.285 --> 01:27:30.452
- [Man On Radio] Good job. 44.

1665
01:27:30.452 --> 01:27:32.121
let us know if there's any change.

1666
01:27:32.121 --> 01:27:34.207
See you in 10. peace out.
