178
00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:20.325
They're not gonna
bring you in
just for a cyst.

179
00:14:20.358 --> 00:14:22.494
All I know is
it felt serious.

180
00:14:23.528 --> 00:14:26.398
That's because
of all the other
sick people around you.

181
00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.303
You see the nonsense
you talk?

182
00:14:32.137 --> 00:14:33.438
How do you
get through life?

183
00:14:33.471 --> 00:14:35.374
All right.
You're still here with me.

184
00:14:35.407 --> 00:14:38.043
I'm just doing that
out of spite.

185
00:14:38.076 --> 00:14:40.279
Right back at you.
kid.

186
00:14:40.312 --> 00:14:42.547
I realize it's been
a very long day
for both of you.

187
00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:45.384
We would have liked
to have been able
to give you a firm answer.

188
00:14:45.417 --> 00:14:48.120
but we can't tell yet
what we're dealing with.

189
00:14:48.153 --> 00:14:49.988
What are all the tests
about then?

190
00:14:50.021 --> 00:14:51.089
Tom.

191
00:14:50.021 --> 00:14:51.089
Yeah. I know.

192
00:14:51.122 --> 00:14:53.425
I realize
it's very frustrating.

193
00:14:53.458 --> 00:14:55.994
We found some cells
that are concerning.

194
00:14:56.027 --> 00:15:01.166
On a scale of one to five.
one being it isn't cancerous
and five being it is.

195
00:15:01.199 --> 00:15:03.302
at the moment.
we're sitting at three.

196
00:15:12.644 --> 00:15:15.480
Do you wanna go out
for something
to eat tonight?

197
00:15:15.513 --> 00:15:17.082
Thai or something?

198
00:15:18.383 --> 00:15:19.485
Um...

199
00:15:20.519 --> 00:15:23.689
No. I've already
taken the chops out
for dinner.

200
00:15:23.722 --> 00:15:25.124
I just thought...

201
00:15:26.191 --> 00:15:28.394
I know.
I'm all right.

202
00:15:30.362 --> 00:15:32.564
I know.
Baby. it wasn't...

203
00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.602
Breaks the day up.

204
00:15:38.336 --> 00:15:40.406
No. I want
to cook the chops.

205
00:16:33.825 --> 00:16:35.527
She doesn't know.

206
00:16:33.825 --> 00:16:35.527
Oh.

207
00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.363
You'd think that would be
the type of thing
they would know.

208
00:16:38.396 --> 00:16:41.433
Did you tell her
your stroke scenario?

209
00:16:38.396 --> 00:16:41.433
Oh. yes.

210
00:16:43.234 --> 00:16:45.103
We need
tomato juice.

211
00:16:45.136 --> 00:16:46.505
That's
the next aisle.

212
00:16:46.538 --> 00:16:49.241
[Tom] I know that.
I'm just saying we need it.

213
00:16:50.241 --> 00:16:51.743
You drink too much
tomato juice.

214
00:16:51.776 --> 00:16:54.780
That stuff
made from concentrate
is full of sugar.

215
00:16:54.813 --> 00:16:57.416
They used to have
the stuff that
isn't concentrate.

216
00:16:57.449 --> 00:16:59.385
but they don't
have it anymore.

217
00:17:00.418 --> 00:17:03.155
I like tomato juice.

218
00:17:00.418 --> 00:17:03.155
[chuckles]

219
00:17:04.289 --> 00:17:06.358
Why don't you just
eat more tomatoes?

220
00:17:06.391 --> 00:17:09.528
What's wrong with you?
Eat more tomatoes!

221
00:17:09.561 --> 00:17:12.064
[woman]
I'm just saying.

222
00:17:12.097 --> 00:17:15.400
We should buy a juicer.
Then you could make
your own tomato juice.

223
00:17:15.433 --> 00:17:17.669
What's the chances
of that happening?

224
00:17:17.702 --> 00:17:20.505
It would just sit there
beside a bowl
of rotten tomatoes

225
00:17:20.538 --> 00:17:22.841
and a carton
of tomato juice.

226
00:17:22.874 --> 00:17:25.511
Well. it wouldn't
if you'd use it.

227
00:17:26.611 --> 00:17:28.447
Hold on till
I get this
right here.

228
00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.549
We're having
some type
of an argument

229
00:17:30.582 --> 00:17:34.486
about the frequency
of me using a juicer
we don't own.

230
00:17:34.519 --> 00:17:38.690
No. I'm just saying.
if you had it.
then you should use it.

231
00:17:38.723 --> 00:17:40.726
Aye. very good.

232
00:17:44.229 --> 00:17:46.632
What's gonna happen
if I've got cancer?

233
00:17:49.567 --> 00:17:52.104
You don't know
that you do.

234
00:17:52.137 --> 00:17:53.372
If.

235
00:17:54.339 --> 00:17:58.643
She said on a scale
of one to five.
it's three.

236
00:17:58.676 --> 00:18:02.214
I don't think
she would have said that
if it was gonna be five.

237
00:18:02.247 --> 00:18:04.749
Three is closer to five
than it is to one.

238
00:18:04.782 --> 00:18:06.618
No. it isn't.

239
00:18:06.651 --> 00:18:11.389
It isn't. but in your head.
three is closer to five
than it is to one.

240
00:18:11.422 --> 00:18:14.192
I don't know why.
but you know
what I mean. It is.

241
00:18:14.225 --> 00:18:15.394
It isn't.

242
00:18:18.396 --> 00:18:21.233
Well. what's gonna happen
if I've got cancer?

243
00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:25.904
There's no point
in thinking like that now.

244
00:18:25.937 --> 00:18:29.141
You don't know.
You can't do anything
until you know.

245
00:18:29.174 --> 00:18:30.909
I know.

246
00:18:30.942 --> 00:18:32.511
I know I've got it.

247
00:18:32.544 --> 00:18:34.179
So you're
a doctor now?

248
00:18:34.212 --> 00:18:36.915
You don't have
to be a doctor to know
things like that.

249
00:18:36.948 --> 00:18:38.817
Yes. you do.

250
00:18:36.948 --> 00:18:38.817
[sighs]

251
00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:43.288
I know that three is closer
to five. and I know
I've got breast cancer.

252
00:18:43.321 --> 00:18:46.558
Okay.
Well. what are you
gonna do then?

253
00:18:47.859 --> 00:18:49.628
I don't know.

254
00:18:49.661 --> 00:18:53.532
Correct. Because
you can't do anything
because you don't know.

255
00:18:54.399 --> 00:18:56.502
Well. that's not
an answer.

256
00:18:59.671 --> 00:19:00.672
Joan...

257
00:19:04.242 --> 00:19:07.646
If you have breast cancer.
which I don't think
you do...

258
00:19:07.679 --> 00:19:10.649
if you have
breast cancer.

259
00:19:10.682 --> 00:19:13.418
we will do whatever
has to be done.

260
00:19:13.451 --> 00:19:14.920
the two of us.

261
00:19:14.953 --> 00:19:16.722
That's what's
gonna happen.

262
00:19:29.234 --> 00:19:30.735
I have to go
to the toilet.

263
00:19:30.768 --> 00:19:34.573
Don't be long.
I might be called.

264
00:19:30.768 --> 00:19:34.573
I'll be as long as it takes.

265
00:19:56.494 --> 00:19:58.597
[man]
Mrs. Joan Thompson?

266
00:20:06.771 --> 00:20:08.807
Joan?

267
00:20:06.771 --> 00:20:08.807
Yes.

268
00:20:09.874 --> 00:20:12.344
Sorry. I'm just waiting
on my husband.

269
00:20:12.377 --> 00:20:14.479
He's at the toilet.

270
00:20:12.377 --> 00:20:14.479
Of course.

271
00:20:20.485 --> 00:20:21.687
There he is.

272
00:20:23.788 --> 00:20:25.957
[doctor]  We've been able
to look at your biopsy results.

273
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:29.327
and I'm afraid it's not the news
we were hoping for.

274
00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.263
It does show
that there is cancer.

275
00:20:35.333 --> 00:20:37.702
We'll talk today
about the road ahead.

276
00:20:37.735 --> 00:20:40.639
I think we should
start chemotherapy
in the next weeks.

277
00:20:41.372 --> 00:20:42.741
This would mean
a first surgery

278
00:20:42.774 --> 00:20:45.010
to remove the lump
and any lymph glands involved.

279
00:20:45.043 --> 00:20:46.712
followed by chemo.

280
00:20:47.745 --> 00:20:49.881
To reduce the risk of recurrence
in your situation.

281
00:20:49.914 --> 00:20:53.785
we'll discuss a further surgery
to remove both breasts.

282
00:20:53.818 --> 00:20:57.389
And. of course.
your options for reconstruction.

283
00:21:37.061 --> 00:21:39.431
[man on TV. indistinct]

284
00:21:40.998 --> 00:21:42.534
[sighs]

285
00:21:43.968 --> 00:21:45.704
Joan.

286
00:21:47.004 --> 00:21:48.640
Joan!

287
00:21:50.041 --> 00:21:54.546
Come on. kid. No point
in lying there. Come on.
Let's get you up to bed.

288
00:21:54.579 --> 00:21:57.949
All right.
Good man.

289
00:21:57.982 --> 00:22:00.585
All right.
One. two. three.
Hup!

290
00:22:02.053 --> 00:22:03.521
[Joan] Oh.

291
00:22:03.554 --> 00:22:04.956
[Tom] That's it.

292
00:22:35.486 --> 00:22:37.689
[gasps]

293
00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:45.097
[whispers]
I love you.

294
00:22:58.176 --> 00:23:00.545
This is gonna
sound strange.

295
00:23:01.179 --> 00:23:02.881
I'm sure it won't.

296
00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:09.521
I'm glad our Debbie
isn't here
to go through this.

297
00:23:13.524 --> 00:23:16.528
I mean. I miss her
every day. but...

298
00:23:18.529 --> 00:23:20.632
this would
break her heart.

299
00:23:26.237 --> 00:23:27.873
Look at me.

300
00:23:29.173 --> 00:23:30.675
Tom.

301
00:23:33.244 --> 00:23:35.647
Joan. look at me.

302
00:23:39.984 --> 00:23:42.053
Don't make me cry.

303
00:23:42.086 --> 00:23:45.657
There isn't a moment
I won't be there with you.

304
00:23:46.557 --> 00:23:47.993
I know.

305
00:23:49.227 --> 00:23:50.795
I'm gonna torture you.

306
00:23:50.828 --> 00:23:52.797
You know that. don't you?

307
00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:55.934
You torture me now.

308
00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:55.934
Good.

309
00:23:55.967 --> 00:23:57.969
You know what
to expect then.

310
00:23:59.704 --> 00:24:01.673
I'm frightened.

311
00:24:01.706 --> 00:24:03.642
I know. kid.
I know.

312
00:24:05.643 --> 00:24:07.579
Every moment.

313
00:24:10.081 --> 00:24:12.818
Go on. eat your toast
before it gets cold.

314
00:24:51.556 --> 00:24:54.792
We should've left earlier.
It's an operation.
You can't be late.

315
00:24:54.825 --> 00:24:56.194
We won't be late.

316
00:24:58.029 --> 00:25:01.900
-It's only a fish.
-You still have to feed it.

317
00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.704
-Flush it.
-Flush you.

318
00:25:06.304 --> 00:25:08.840
Very good.
[chuckles]

319
00:25:12.209 --> 00:25:13.745
How long does it take?

320
00:25:13.778 --> 00:25:14.946
How long
does what take?

321
00:25:14.979 --> 00:25:18.016
The operation.

322
00:25:14.979 --> 00:25:18.016
Oh. I don't know.

323
00:25:18.049 --> 00:25:18.950
Hours.

324
00:25:20.318 --> 00:25:22.754
You've got plenty
of time to go to the grave.

325
00:25:22.787 --> 00:25:25.957
-I wanna be there
when you get out.
-Tom. it's her birthday.

326
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:29.728
We always go to the grave
on her birthday.
You'll have time.

327
00:25:36.067 --> 00:25:37.735
Tell her I'm sorry
I'm not there.

328
00:25:37.768 --> 00:25:39.704
but don't tell her why.

329
00:25:37.768 --> 00:25:39.704
Joan--

330
00:25:39.737 --> 00:25:41.739
That's the way
I have to think about it.

331
00:25:41.772 --> 00:25:43.241
Am I not
allowed to do that?

332
00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:53.318
If I was there I'd say it.
but I'm not there.
so you can say it.

333
00:25:53.351 --> 00:25:56.020
If you were there.
you wouldn't have to say
you weren't there.

334
00:25:56.053 --> 00:25:57.922
Tom. everything
isn't a joke!

335
00:25:57.955 --> 00:25:59.691
Joan. she's dead.

336
00:25:57.955 --> 00:25:59.691
I know.

337
00:25:59.724 --> 00:26:01.927
How can I not
know that?

338
00:26:06.664 --> 00:26:09.367
Just do it. Tom. please.
Just do it.

339
00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.802
Sorry.

340
00:26:12.269 --> 00:26:13.838
Of course I will.

341
00:26:14.739 --> 00:26:16.007
Sorry.

342
00:26:16.707 --> 00:26:19.244
It's all right.
It's fine.

343
00:26:32.857 --> 00:26:34.993
Right.

344
00:26:32.857 --> 00:26:34.993
Yeah.

345
00:26:38.362 --> 00:26:41.699
It'll be over in no time.
I'll be back here
waiting for you.

346
00:26:41.732 --> 00:26:42.901
I know.

347
00:26:44.068 --> 00:26:47.339
[chuckles]

348
00:26:44.068 --> 00:26:47.339
All right.
kid.

349
00:26:48.939 --> 00:26:51.142
See you soon.

350
00:26:48.939 --> 00:26:51.142
Yeah.

351
00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:54.145
Go on then.

352
00:27:02.019 --> 00:27:03.888
[female voice]
Door closing.

353
00:27:26.777 --> 00:27:28.980
[sighs]
Happy birthday. love.

354
00:27:30.448 --> 00:27:34.319
Your mother says she's sorry
she can't be here since...

355
00:27:36.253 --> 00:27:37.455
[sighs]

356
00:27:37.488 --> 00:27:39.190
Look. Debbie.
this is...

357
00:27:39.223 --> 00:27:42.193
this is...
this is crazy.
This...

358
00:27:43.127 --> 00:27:46.197
This isn't
how I see you.
You're not here.

359
00:27:47.398 --> 00:27:50.802
All I'm doing here
is talking to a bit
of stone.

360
00:27:55.206 --> 00:27:57.876
Your mother
has breast cancer.

361
00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:01.946
She told me
not to tell you that.

362
00:28:01.979 --> 00:28:03.181
And I can understand why.

363
00:28:03.214 --> 00:28:06.351
She... she doesn't
want you to worry.

364
00:28:07.885 --> 00:28:12.223
But I imagine if you're
looking down on us. you heard
that conversation. so...

365
00:28:13.491 --> 00:28:17.962
It's just helping her
get through it. that's all.

366
00:28:18.829 --> 00:28:21.166
Protecting you
makes her stronger.

367
00:28:22.967 --> 00:28:24.736
She found out
about a month ago.

368
00:28:24.769 --> 00:28:27.371
She's having
an operation today
to remove the lumps.

369
00:28:27.404 --> 00:28:31.943
So they'll know more
after that. how serious
the situation is.

370
00:28:31.976 --> 00:28:33.811
I mean.
it's serious now.

371
00:28:33.844 --> 00:28:35.980
I mean.
cancer is cancer.

372
00:28:41.986 --> 00:28:43.221
I just...

373
00:28:44.288 --> 00:28:47.125
I just can't tell her
how frightened I am.

374
00:28:53.197 --> 00:28:56.234
Just got to continue on
as normal.

375
00:28:57.368 --> 00:29:00.038
I suppose that's my job
in all this.

376
00:29:01.138 --> 00:29:03.074
That's all you can do.

377
00:29:08.279 --> 00:29:11.015
I couldn't have
the both of you gone.

378
00:29:12.383 --> 00:29:14.352
I'd just be...

379
00:29:15.286 --> 00:29:16.888
adrift.

380
00:29:20.024 --> 00:29:22.494
How do you say to someone.
"Don't die"?

381
00:29:38.409 --> 00:29:41.479
Everything okay
with you today?

382
00:29:38.409 --> 00:29:41.479
Yes. fine. thank you.

383
00:29:45.416 --> 00:29:47.285
[nurse]
Everything is running
to schedule.

384
00:29:47.318 --> 00:29:50.255
so you should all
be brought down in order.

385
00:29:54.325 --> 00:29:56.994
You'd think they'd know
which one they were
going to work on

386
00:29:57.027 --> 00:29:58.930
without having to put
a mark on it.

387
00:30:02.566 --> 00:30:04.268
I'm starving.

388
00:30:02.566 --> 00:30:04.268
So am I.

389
00:30:04.301 --> 00:30:05.736
Me too.

390
00:30:05.769 --> 00:30:09.574
They should be able to give you
a tablet that makes you feel
not starving.

391
00:30:09.607 --> 00:30:11.176
Or a vodka.

392
00:30:12.943 --> 00:30:16.347
Here we go.
More stitches somewhere.

393
00:30:18.115 --> 00:30:21.085
[woman]
Good luck.

394
00:30:18.115 --> 00:30:21.085
Good luck.

395
00:30:21.652 --> 00:30:24.055
Shouldn't be
long now.

396
00:30:31.128 --> 00:30:33.197
Have you had chemo
before?

397
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:36.501
Twice.

398
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:36.501
What's it like?

399
00:30:37.334 --> 00:30:39.370
Second one
wasn't so bad.

400
00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:41.372
First one was rough.

401
00:30:43.073 --> 00:30:45.476
It doesn't last.
and you get through it.

402
00:30:45.509 --> 00:30:48.379
Sometimes you feel
like you won't.
but you do.

403
00:30:50.281 --> 00:30:53.217
Take every tablet
they give you and more.

404
00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:56.587
And always remember.
when you're at your worst.

405
00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:59.257
what you're going through
is better than
the alternative.

406
00:31:05.129 --> 00:31:07.498
-Good luck.
-And you.

407
00:32:57.708 --> 00:32:59.610
You smell lovely.

408
00:33:01.812 --> 00:33:04.215
I try my best.

409
00:33:20.264 --> 00:33:23.034
I was able to remove
the whole tumor.

410
00:33:23.067 --> 00:33:25.336
Now. it wasn't
two lumps.

411
00:33:25.369 --> 00:33:28.039
They were joined.
so we consider that
to be one lump.

412
00:33:28.072 --> 00:33:29.373
Right.

413
00:33:29.406 --> 00:33:32.376
Also. because
the lymph nodes
were involved.

414
00:33:32.409 --> 00:33:35.246
I had to remove
13 of those.

415
00:33:32.409 --> 00:33:35.246
Oh.

416
00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:38.783
And we'll also have
to check it hasn't
spread anywhere else.

417
00:33:38.816 --> 00:33:40.651
Where?

418
00:33:40.684 --> 00:33:43.154
We'll do
a bone scan.

419
00:33:43.187 --> 00:33:48.793
We also need to check
your liver and lungs
with a CT scan.

420
00:33:48.826 --> 00:33:52.496
Was the lump the size
that normally means
it's spread?

421
00:33:52.529 --> 00:33:54.699
There is
no normal here.

422
00:33:55.799 --> 00:33:57.301
We got it.

423
00:33:58.268 --> 00:34:00.338
That all
looks good.

424
00:34:07.411 --> 00:34:08.679
What'd she say?

425
00:34:09.846 --> 00:34:14.285
Um. they got it all.
but it was bigger
than they thought.

426
00:34:14.318 --> 00:34:16.787
Bone scan?

427
00:34:14.318 --> 00:34:16.787
Yes.

428
00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:18.189
Oh.

429
00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:21.325
That's normal.

430
00:35:20.884 --> 00:35:23.254
[air pump whirs]

431
00:35:55.619 --> 00:35:57.655
[flushes]

432
00:36:07.231 --> 00:36:09.433
[sobs]

433
00:36:34.925 --> 00:36:36.460
Excuse me.

434
00:36:44.935 --> 00:36:47.872
Can you kill a goldfish
by overfeeding them?

435
00:36:50.774 --> 00:36:52.343
I don't know.

436
00:36:53.377 --> 00:36:54.879
I've only started
working here.

437
00:36:56.313 --> 00:36:57.582
I only know
about rabbits.

438
00:36:58.615 --> 00:37:01.752
Are they old?

439
00:36:58.615 --> 00:37:01.752
No.

440
00:37:04.054 --> 00:37:07.458
I don't want the wife
to know the one
we had died.

441
00:37:09.593 --> 00:37:11.862
Was she fond
of it?

442
00:37:11.895 --> 00:37:14.865
No.
She hated it.

443
00:37:30.781 --> 00:37:32.683
You all right
to walk?

444
00:37:30.781 --> 00:37:32.683
Fine.

445
00:37:32.716 --> 00:37:35.453
Bye.
I'm on my way now.

446
00:37:32.716 --> 00:37:35.453
[woman] See you.

447
00:38:48.525 --> 00:38:49.927
Thank you.

448
00:38:58.902 --> 00:39:00.571
And what?

449
00:39:00.604 --> 00:39:03.974
You got everything
means you got everything.

450
00:39:04.007 --> 00:39:08.078
No. they did a bone scan
to see if the cancer
had spread to my bones.

451
00:39:08.111 --> 00:39:09.713
And that was clear.

452
00:39:09.746 --> 00:39:11.815
Correct.
But now you have to get
an upper-body scan.

453
00:39:11.848 --> 00:39:12.816
Yes.

454
00:39:11.848 --> 00:39:12.816
Why?

455
00:39:12.849 --> 00:39:14.885
Because she wants to check
my liver and my lungs.

456
00:39:14.918 --> 00:39:17.721
Why didn't she check
your lungs when she was
removing the lump?

457
00:39:17.754 --> 00:39:19.757
I don't know.
She can't just
put her hand in.

458
00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:21.558
move things
out of the way
and take a peek.

459
00:39:21.591 --> 00:39:24.628
How do you know
they don't do that?
Are you a doctor now?

460
00:39:24.661 --> 00:39:26.130
Stop talking stupid.

461
00:39:26.163 --> 00:39:28.866
Get cancer and end up
knowing everything
about medicine.

462
00:39:28.899 --> 00:39:31.435
All I know is
there's something
they're not telling us.

463
00:39:31.468 --> 00:39:34.071
There's nothing
they're not telling us.
Why are you doing this?

464
00:39:34.104 --> 00:39:36.774
Up to the damn hospital
again and again and again.

465
00:39:36.807 --> 00:39:39.410
Well. you don't have
to come with me
all the time.

466
00:39:39.443 --> 00:39:42.079
What would you do
on your own?

467
00:39:39.443 --> 00:39:42.079
I'd do what I always do.

468
00:39:42.112 --> 00:39:44.481
I sit and wait
and then I get poked
and prodded at.

469
00:39:44.514 --> 00:39:48.819
And what if
something happens
and I'm not there? No.

470
00:39:52.556 --> 00:39:53.991
Just drive the car.

471
00:39:54.024 --> 00:39:56.560
Aye. just drive the car.
That's me.

472
00:39:57.093 --> 00:39:58.796
Just drive the car.

473
00:40:04.201 --> 00:40:05.936
[Joan]  One.

474
00:40:05.969 --> 00:40:08.071
Two.

475
00:40:08.104 --> 00:40:10.441
Three.

476
00:40:10.474 --> 00:40:12.176
Four.

477
00:40:12.209 --> 00:40:14.178
Five.

478
00:40:14.211 --> 00:40:16.046
Six.

479
00:40:16.079 --> 00:40:17.081
Seven.

480
00:40:18.615 --> 00:40:20.184
Eight.

481
00:40:20.217 --> 00:40:22.486
Nine.

482
00:40:22.519 --> 00:40:24.054
Ten.

483
00:40:24.087 --> 00:40:25.689
Eleven.

484
00:40:25.722 --> 00:40:28.058
Twelve.

485
00:40:28.091 --> 00:40:29.660
Thirteen.

486
00:40:29.693 --> 00:40:31.896
Fourteen.

487
00:40:32.562 --> 00:40:34.164
Fifteen.

488
00:40:34.197 --> 00:40:36.099
Sixteen.

489
00:40:36.132 --> 00:40:38.202
Seventeen.

490
00:40:38.235 --> 00:40:40.070
Eighteen.

491
00:40:40.103 --> 00:40:41.939
Nineteen.

492
00:40:41.972 --> 00:40:43.974
Twenty.

493
00:40:44.841 --> 00:40:46.477
[on speaker]
Twenty-one.

494
00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:48.245
Twenty-two.

495
00:40:48.278 --> 00:40:50.080
Twenty-three.

496
00:40:50.113 --> 00:40:52.149
Twenty-four.

497
00:40:58.121 --> 00:41:00.557
She's been away too long.
That's not good.

498
00:41:00.590 --> 00:41:02.760
Not good what way?

499
00:41:03.793 --> 00:41:06.964
Because
if it was good news.
she'd be right back.

500
00:41:06.997 --> 00:41:11.702
So you think it's bad news
and she doesn't wanna tell you
and she's waiting out there?

501
00:41:11.735 --> 00:41:13.070
That's what I think.

502
00:41:13.103 --> 00:41:16.807
Oh. I think
it's good news.
so she's in no rush.

503
00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.876
No. if it was good news.
you'd be in a rush.

504
00:41:18.909 --> 00:41:22.646
That's the whole point.
You'd want to be
telling the person.

505
00:41:22.679 --> 00:41:25.182
It'd be cruel
if you had good news
to wait to tell someone.

506
00:41:25.215 --> 00:41:28.852
It'd be kind
if you had bad news
to wait to tell them.

507
00:41:28.885 --> 00:41:31.021
She's been away too long.
It's bad news.

508
00:41:31.054 --> 00:41:33.891
[doctor] Sorry.
That took longer
than I thought.

509
00:41:33.924 --> 00:41:36.126
I was called away
to another patient.

510
00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:44.068
Well. good news.
The scan is all clear.

511
00:41:48.905 --> 00:41:50.274
So what does
that mean?

512
00:41:50.307 --> 00:41:54.177
It means
we've removed the lump
and the lymph nodes.

513
00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:56.580
and the cancer
hasn't spread
anywhere else.

514
00:41:56.613 --> 00:41:58.048
So. it's gone?

515
00:41:58.081 --> 00:42:01.018
As far as
we're concerned. yes.

516
00:42:01.051 --> 00:42:04.021
And the next thing
is to refer you
to an oncologist

517
00:42:04.054 --> 00:42:06.757
to discuss chemotherapy
and other therapies.

518
00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:09.693
Why chemo?
You just said
it was gone.

519
00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:13.630
There still might be
tiny cancerous cells

520
00:42:13.663 --> 00:42:15.232
that we can't detect
through scanning.

521
00:42:15.265 --> 00:42:20.170
So... when you said
the cancer is gone.
that may not be true?

522
00:42:20.203 --> 00:42:23.206
Tom. don't--

523
00:42:20.203 --> 00:42:23.206
I just want to get
everything clear.

524
00:42:23.239 --> 00:42:24.641
And so you should.

525
00:42:24.674 --> 00:42:26.944
The cancer that was there
has been removed

526
00:42:26.977 --> 00:42:29.146
and it hasn't spread
any further.

527
00:42:29.179 --> 00:42:32.850
And Joan is now ready
for chemotherapy.

528
00:42:33.817 --> 00:42:36.220
Thank you. Doctor.
That's very clear.
Thank you.

529
00:42:42.359 --> 00:42:46.030
From now on.
when we're at the hospital.
I don't want you talking.

530
00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:50.233
If I didn't talk.
we wouldn't
know anything.

531
00:42:50.266 --> 00:42:53.137
We already knew.
We'd already
been told.

532
00:42:53.937 --> 00:42:55.205
It's just you
being you.

533
00:42:55.839 --> 00:42:57.040
Cancer-free.
she said.

534
00:42:57.073 --> 00:42:59.243
Yes. I knew
what she meant.

535
00:43:01.144 --> 00:43:04.314
In situations
like this. you have
to be exact.

536
00:43:04.347 --> 00:43:08.285
Oh. I'm sorry. Tom.
Are we in a hospital
or are we in a courtroom?

537
00:43:09.219 --> 00:43:11.755
It's not
black and white.
The world's gray.

538
00:43:11.788 --> 00:43:13.991
It's nothing to do
with black and white.

539
00:43:15.091 --> 00:43:17.728
Cancer-free
is different
from not cancer-free.

540
00:43:17.761 --> 00:43:20.898
Hmm.
Are you cancer free?

541
00:43:21.865 --> 00:43:23.800
Very good.

542
00:43:23.833 --> 00:43:25.902
"As far as we know."

543
00:43:25.935 --> 00:43:28.238
I knew what
she meant.

544
00:43:28.271 --> 00:43:30.841
So from now on.
no more talk from you.

545
00:43:30.874 --> 00:43:32.876
It's to do
with me anyway.
I'll ask.

546
00:43:32.909 --> 00:43:34.778
It's to do with you.
You'll ask.

547
00:43:34.811 --> 00:43:36.981
Yes. That was
embarrassing.

548
00:43:37.414 --> 00:43:39.316
Embarrassing?

549
00:43:37.414 --> 00:43:39.316
Yes.

550
00:44:04.074 --> 00:44:06.143
You wanna
sit here?

551
00:44:04.074 --> 00:44:06.143
Yeah.

552
00:44:21.191 --> 00:44:23.460
You see that man
in the blue shirt
over there?

553
00:44:23.493 --> 00:44:25.095
Yeah.

554
00:44:25.128 --> 00:44:28.265
I think he was
our Debbie's teacher
at primary school.

555
00:44:28.298 --> 00:44:30.334
Oh. right enough.

556
00:44:31.367 --> 00:44:34.004
Yes. arrogant.

557
00:44:31.367 --> 00:44:34.004
Yeah.

558
00:44:34.037 --> 00:44:37.174
I'm gonna talk
to him.

559
00:44:34.037 --> 00:44:37.174
What for?

560
00:44:37.207 --> 00:44:40.210
What for?
There's something
the matter with you.

561
00:44:40.243 --> 00:44:43.947
Just to talk to him.
Tell him who I am.
that I recognized him.

562
00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:45.816
He looks alone.

563
00:44:49.352 --> 00:44:51.055
Sorry.

564
00:44:52.155 --> 00:44:56.760
I just saw you
sitting here.
I think I know you.

565
00:44:56.793 --> 00:45:00.731
Did you used to teach
my daughter. Debbie Thompson.
in primary school?

566
00:45:00.764 --> 00:45:02.332
I did.

567
00:45:03.266 --> 00:45:06.737
I was very sad to hear
what happened to Debbie.

568
00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:08.438
Oh.

569
00:45:08.471 --> 00:45:09.506
It's Joan.

570
00:45:09.539 --> 00:45:11.141
Peter.

571
00:45:11.174 --> 00:45:13.076
Debbie was
a delightful child.

572
00:45:13.109 --> 00:45:14.945
Pleasure to teach.

573
00:45:14.978 --> 00:45:18.815
Hmm. Do you
still teach?

574
00:45:14.978 --> 00:45:18.815
Not at the moment.

575
00:45:18.848 --> 00:45:21.151
Oh. please. sit down.

576
00:45:23.153 --> 00:45:24.988
Are you
on your own?

577
00:45:25.021 --> 00:45:27.891
Oh. my partner. Steve.
is downstairs
in the café.

578
00:45:27.924 --> 00:45:31.228
He gets
very emotional.

579
00:45:31.261 --> 00:45:34.831
It's difficult for him.

580
00:45:31.261 --> 00:45:34.831
Hmm. I see that
in my husband.

581
00:45:34.864 --> 00:45:38.335
Right. So you have
the buzzer?

582
00:45:39.402 --> 00:45:42.472
Yes. Yeah.

583
00:45:39.402 --> 00:45:42.472
Right.

584
00:45:42.505 --> 00:45:44.407
Is this your
first time here?

585
00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:46.109
No. second.

586
00:45:46.142 --> 00:45:48.345
How's your treatment
going?

587
00:45:49.412 --> 00:45:51.882
I'm... I'm terminal.

588
00:45:52.582 --> 00:45:53.884
Oh. I'm sorry.

589
00:45:53.917 --> 00:45:56.086
Yeah. They say
if I take the chemo.

590
00:45:56.119 --> 00:45:58.155
we'll have
a while longer.

591
00:45:58.188 --> 00:46:00.257
What... What are you
here for?

592
00:46:01.424 --> 00:46:03.127
Breast cancer.

593
00:46:06.329 --> 00:46:08.532
Has the chemo
been difficult?

594
00:46:09.265 --> 00:46:11.001
Difficult enough.
The nausea.

595
00:46:11.034 --> 00:46:14.171
That might not
be difficult for you.
Each treatment's different.

596
00:46:14.204 --> 00:46:16.073
They say that.
anyway.

597
00:46:17.907 --> 00:46:22.112
I don't wanna lose my hair.
No hair at my age.
I think I'd look like a man.

598
00:46:22.145 --> 00:46:26.316
[chuckles]
For me they said
maybe. maybe not.

599
00:46:26.349 --> 00:46:28.819
I do not want
to be buried bald.

600
00:46:28.852 --> 00:46:30.053
Actually.
that's not true.

601
00:46:30.086 --> 00:46:31.588
Being buried bald
isn't the issue.

602
00:46:31.621 --> 00:46:34.991
Lying in me coffin
with the lid off it.
bald. for all to see.

603
00:46:35.024 --> 00:46:40.063
Not that there will be
anybody there. but that's not
the point. Just in case.

604
00:46:41.297 --> 00:46:43.066
I think you'd look
dignified.

605
00:46:43.933 --> 00:46:46.102
Dignified?
No. horrified.

606
00:46:46.135 --> 00:46:48.272
[both chuckle]

607
00:46:49.172 --> 00:46:51.575
Well. you might not
lose it.

608
00:46:51.608 --> 00:46:54.478
Whenever they say
"you might."
it means you will.

609
00:46:56.179 --> 00:47:00.217
We should get that printed
on T-shirts. Wear them
to the chemo sessions.

610
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:03.987
[buzzer buzzing]

611
00:47:05.054 --> 00:47:08.258
Well... there we go.

612
00:47:09.959 --> 00:47:11.127
Okay.

613
00:47:09.959 --> 00:47:11.127
Well...

614
00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:13.296
It's lovely
to meet you. Peter.

615
00:47:13.329 --> 00:47:15.365
I'm glad
I came over to talk.

616
00:47:15.398 --> 00:47:17.367
Yeah.
Lovely to meet you.
Joan.

617
00:47:22.372 --> 00:47:24.174
I take it
that's him then?

618
00:47:24.207 --> 00:47:27.344
Yeah.
His name's Peter.

619
00:47:28.411 --> 00:47:31.248
Did he remember
our Debbie?

620
00:47:28.411 --> 00:47:31.248
Of course he did.

621
00:47:31.281 --> 00:47:33.383
Talked of her
really fondly.

622
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:38.222
Is he still
arrogant?

623
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:38.222
Huh. No.

624
00:47:39.088 --> 00:47:41.258
He's got
terminal cancer.

625
00:47:41.925 --> 00:47:43.193
Oh.

626
00:47:44.027 --> 00:47:46.230
That's not good.

627
00:47:44.027 --> 00:47:46.230
No.

628
00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:50.033
His partner. Steve.
I think he said
he was called.

629
00:47:50.066 --> 00:47:53.337
he sits downstairs.
He can't come up here.

630
00:47:55.505 --> 00:47:56.773
Yeah.

631
00:47:56.807 --> 00:48:00.244
I can imagine that would be
difficult for some people.
all right.

632
00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:05.616
I hope I bump
into him again.

633
00:48:06.282 --> 00:48:08.118
I'm sure you will.

634
00:48:08.151 --> 00:48:10.053
He doesn't look gay.

635
00:48:10.687 --> 00:48:12.222
No.

636
00:48:13.523 --> 00:48:16.159
But then you
don't look...

637
00:48:13.523 --> 00:48:16.159
Easy. tiger.

638
00:48:17.293 --> 00:48:19.463
I was gonna say
kind.

639
00:48:20.296 --> 00:48:23.100
There's not many
of us left.

640
00:48:20.296 --> 00:48:23.100
Hmm.

641
00:48:24.968 --> 00:48:27.704
I couldn't say stupid
because you do
look stupid.

642
00:48:27.737 --> 00:48:31.408
Living with you too long
has me looking like that.

643
00:48:35.178 --> 00:48:37.414
[buzzer buzzing]

644
00:48:35.178 --> 00:48:37.414
Oh!

645
00:48:37.447 --> 00:48:39.616
Here we go.

646
00:48:37.447 --> 00:48:39.616
Here we go.

647
00:49:57.627 --> 00:49:59.696
[retching]

648
00:50:01.097 --> 00:50:02.799
It's all right.
it's all right.

649
00:50:02.832 --> 00:50:04.534
Oh. God.

650
00:50:05.735 --> 00:50:08.672
Is your head sore?
Shall I get
a cold cloth?

651
00:50:09.806 --> 00:50:11.475
No. I'm freezing.

652
00:50:12.275 --> 00:50:14.511
Blanket?
Want a blanket?

653
00:50:14.544 --> 00:50:17.147
No. it'll be all right.
It'll go in a minute.

654
00:50:18.614 --> 00:50:23.653
Shall I take this...
this basin away and clean it out
or is there more?

655
00:50:24.687 --> 00:50:27.657
There will be more. but you
can clean it out anyway.

656
00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:30.527
Shall I go and just
get another basin?

657
00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:33.163
No. just... just clean
that one out.

658
00:50:33.196 --> 00:50:34.664
Right. right. right.

659
00:50:36.099 --> 00:50:39.302
[breathes heavily]

660
00:50:40.703 --> 00:50:43.774
[groans]

661
00:50:48.311 --> 00:50:51.748
[woman]
Sarah has started a project
at nearby Fillingham Court.

662
00:50:52.648 --> 00:50:54.684
She's teaching the residents
about gardening

663
00:50:54.717 --> 00:50:58.288
to inspire them
to make the most
of their communal areas

664
00:50:58.321 --> 00:51:00.557
and brighten up
their balconies.

665
00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:04.327
What rubbish bin
goes out tonight?
Brown or gray?

666
00:51:07.196 --> 00:51:08.765
I'm not sure.

667
00:51:10.133 --> 00:51:11.801
What went out
last week?

668
00:51:11.834 --> 00:51:16.273
If I knew what went out
last week. I'd know what
one goes out tonight.

669
00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:18.642
Think it's gray.

670
00:51:20.309 --> 00:51:22.479
Just look what
the neighbors put out.

671
00:51:24.213 --> 00:51:25.782
I know it's summer.
but what's the point

672
00:51:25.815 --> 00:51:28.384
of having a bin
for garden waste
during the winter

673
00:51:28.417 --> 00:51:30.353
when there isn't
any garden waste?

674
00:51:30.386 --> 00:51:31.588
Don't know.

675
00:51:32.488 --> 00:51:33.790
Well.
you should know.

676
00:51:33.823 --> 00:51:36.359
That could be
vital information
at some point.

677
00:51:37.226 --> 00:51:40.497
Vital? Really?

678
00:51:37.226 --> 00:51:40.497
Yes. Joan.
Vital.

679
00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:43.467
Why don't you go
for a walk?

680
00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:43.467
No.

681
00:51:44.534 --> 00:51:46.469
No. I'm staying.
Watch TV.

682
00:51:46.502 --> 00:51:48.738
I haven't numbed
my brain enough
today.

683
00:51:52.208 --> 00:51:53.376
Hmm.

684
00:52:30.413 --> 00:52:33.617
All right?

685
00:52:30.413 --> 00:52:33.617
It's coming out
in clumps now.

686
00:52:36.519 --> 00:52:38.388
What do you want
to do?

687
00:52:39.689 --> 00:52:41.925
I don't know.

688
00:52:39.689 --> 00:52:41.925
Look.
there's no...

689
00:52:41.958 --> 00:52:46.563
No. I know.

690
00:52:41.958 --> 00:52:46.563
I'll do it.
Do you want me to do it?

691
00:52:46.996 --> 00:52:49.532
[laughs]

692
00:52:49.565 --> 00:52:51.868
What?
Where's the scissors?

693
00:52:54.537 --> 00:52:56.406
In the drawer.

694
00:52:54.537 --> 00:52:56.406
Right.

695
00:53:02.612 --> 00:53:04.447
Do you wanna
stand or sit?

696
00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:08.385
When have you ever seen
anyone getting their hair cut
standing up?

697
00:53:10.319 --> 00:53:12.522
[sighs]

698
00:53:16.392 --> 00:53:18.595
[chuckles]

699
00:53:27.637 --> 00:53:28.772
Okay?

700
00:53:29.805 --> 00:53:30.840
Yeah.

701
00:53:40.716 --> 00:53:42.685
[chuckles]

702
00:53:42.718 --> 00:53:44.487
Stop.

703
00:53:50.593 --> 00:53:53.796
So. what do you
and your hairdresser
talk about?

704
00:53:53.829 --> 00:53:55.832
You and what
an idiot you are.

705
00:53:55.865 --> 00:53:58.802
An idiot who has
a pair of scissors
in his hand.

706
00:53:59.669 --> 00:54:01.904
Any particular style
today. madam?

707
00:54:01.937 --> 00:54:04.241
[chuckles] Beehive.

708
00:54:04.774 --> 00:54:07.310
Showing your age
there. kid.

709
00:54:07.343 --> 00:54:09.512
A beehive it is.

710
00:55:15.544 --> 00:55:18.515
Ta-da!

711
00:55:15.544 --> 00:55:18.515
[chuckles]

712
00:55:21.751 --> 00:55:23.686
What do you
think?

713
00:55:23.719 --> 00:55:25.755
You look
beautiful.

714
00:55:26.789 --> 00:55:29.693
But then I never really
liked your hair
to begin with.

715
00:55:33.629 --> 00:55:35.932
It feels weird.

716
00:55:35.965 --> 00:55:37.633
You're a star. kid.

717
00:55:37.666 --> 00:55:39.736
Absolute star.

718
00:56:28.684 --> 00:56:31.554
[TV playing. indistinct]

719
00:56:33.889 --> 00:56:36.926
[announcer speaking.
indistinct]

720
00:56:42.665 --> 00:56:45.034
[breathing heavily]

721
00:57:17.266 --> 00:57:19.669
[TV continues. indistinct]

722
00:57:28.110 --> 00:57:30.814
[breathing heavily]

723
00:57:41.891 --> 00:57:44.093
[TV continues. indistinct]

724
00:57:57.773 --> 00:57:59.709
Did you
write it down?

725
00:57:57.773 --> 00:57:59.709
No.

726
00:57:59.742 --> 00:58:01.844
What do you mean.
no?

727
00:58:01.877 --> 00:58:04.580
I gave you
a notebook and a pen
especially for that.

728
00:58:04.613 --> 00:58:06.816
I didn't
write it down.

729
00:58:08.751 --> 00:58:11.754
So. you don't know
what tablet to take?

730
00:58:11.787 --> 00:58:13.055
No. Just guess.

731
00:58:13.088 --> 00:58:15.157
You can't guess. Joan.
They're too strong.

732
00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:18.528
Tom. please.
The pain in my legs
and feet is...

733
00:58:18.561 --> 00:58:21.731
I'm in agony.
Just give me a tablet.
It's one of three.

734
00:58:21.764 --> 00:58:23.699
Just pick one.
I don't care which.

735
00:58:23.732 --> 00:58:26.168
You were told
to write this down.

736
00:58:23.732 --> 00:58:26.168
Oh. what?

737
00:58:26.201 --> 00:58:28.271
Because I didn't.
you're gonna punish me?

738
00:58:28.304 --> 00:58:32.141
Whose pain is this?
Who's going through this?
Me or you?

739
00:58:32.174 --> 00:58:36.012
You sit downstairs
drinking beer while
I'm up here in pain.

740
00:58:36.045 --> 00:58:38.281
Excuse me.
Everything you need.
I get.

741
00:58:38.314 --> 00:58:42.018
Well. get me a tablet.

742
00:58:38.314 --> 00:58:42.018
I don't know which one.

743
00:58:42.051 --> 00:58:44.921
Don't give me
that "poor me" garbage.
Did I give you the cancer?

744
00:58:44.954 --> 00:58:46.756
This isn't about cancer.
This is about you.

745
00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:49.759
You never do anything for me
until you've sorted
yourself out.

746
00:58:49.792 --> 00:58:51.160
That right?

747
00:58:49.792 --> 00:58:51.160
Yes.

748
00:58:51.193 --> 00:58:53.229
I didn't want to fill out
your silly little notepad

749
00:58:53.262 --> 00:58:55.731
because I didn't
feel like it. all right?

750
00:58:55.764 --> 00:58:58.034
No! Because you like
all this.

751
00:58:58.067 --> 00:59:00.169
You'd rather be worse
than better.

752
00:59:00.202 --> 00:59:01.370
It's in your nature.

753
00:59:01.403 --> 00:59:04.640
It's all.
"Look at me. This was
always gonna happen to me!

754
00:59:04.673 --> 00:59:07.277
My daughter was killed!
Look at me!"

755
00:59:09.979 --> 00:59:11.714
I hate you.
you know that?

756
00:59:11.747 --> 00:59:15.051
Oh. I know it. all right.
It's there underneath
all the time.

757
00:59:15.084 --> 00:59:18.654
Here. there's the box.
You wanna take a tablet?
Take one.

758
00:59:18.687 --> 00:59:19.922
Just leave me alone.

759
00:59:19.955 --> 00:59:22.124
On top of everything
I have to deal with you.

760
00:59:22.157 --> 00:59:23.893
We're both
going through this.

761
00:59:23.926 --> 00:59:27.096
No. we're not! Tom. we're not!
I'm going through it!

762
00:59:28.964 --> 00:59:31.867
You've just gotta cope
with things.
cope with stuff.

763
00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:34.670
I had the cancer.
I'm going through chemo.

764
00:59:34.703 --> 00:59:37.240
I need to have
a double-mastectomy.

765
00:59:40.376 --> 00:59:42.712
I'm doing my best here!

766
00:59:42.745 --> 00:59:44.881
No. you're not!

767
00:59:42.745 --> 00:59:44.881
[pills clatter]

768
01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:19.215
Hi.

769
01:00:20.149 --> 01:00:21.284
Hi.

770
01:00:23.852 --> 01:00:25.755
Is this
your first session?

771
01:00:25.788 --> 01:00:27.723
Yes.

772
01:00:27.756 --> 01:00:30.860
Don't be worried about
all the goings-on here.
You get used to it.

773
01:00:30.893 --> 01:00:33.663
You think you won't.
but you do.

774
01:00:33.696 --> 01:00:37.233
I always think it's like
a busy train station
or something.

775
01:00:38.233 --> 01:00:39.268
Yeah.

776
01:00:40.769 --> 01:00:42.872
How many sessions
have you to do?

777
01:00:42.905 --> 01:00:45.408
Six.

778
01:00:42.905 --> 01:00:45.408
Oh.

779
01:00:45.441 --> 01:00:48.778
-Breast cancer.
-Same here.

780
01:00:49.812 --> 01:00:51.047
I hear it's hard.

781
01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:54.117
Well. it can be.
but you get through it.

782
01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:58.221
Take all the painkillers
you can get your hands on.

783
01:00:59.188 --> 01:01:02.959
Once the pain kicks in.
it's hard to get rid of.

784
01:01:07.496 --> 01:01:09.932
[nurse] Now. are we ready?

785
01:01:18.107 --> 01:01:20.242
[Peter]
Yeah. I like it.
It suits you.

786
01:01:20.275 --> 01:01:21.977
No. it doesn't.

787
01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:23.846
No. it doesn't.

788
01:01:23.879 --> 01:01:28.050
I went to the hairdresser's
and she cut it.
I think it looks worse.

789
01:01:28.083 --> 01:01:30.019
It's not even
the right color.

790
01:01:30.986 --> 01:01:34.056
What does Tom
think of it?

791
01:01:30.986 --> 01:01:34.056
Oh. I don't know.

792
01:01:34.089 --> 01:01:38.327
I mean. he wouldn't say
that he didn't like it.

793
01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.263
but you know...

794
01:01:41.830 --> 01:01:44.066
He's at the end
of his tether.

795
01:01:44.099 --> 01:01:45.968
I can see it in him.

796
01:01:46.969 --> 01:01:49.405
Oh. but to hell
with him. so am I.

797
01:01:49.438 --> 01:01:51.907
Too right.

798
01:01:49.438 --> 01:01:51.907
[chuckles]

799
01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:54.343
We fought
the other night.

800
01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:54.343
Hmm?

801
01:01:54.376 --> 01:01:58.047
Oh. well.
you need a blowout.
don't you?

802
01:01:59.014 --> 01:02:01.217
Steve won't do it.
not that he's that type.

803
01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:04.854
but even so. God.
he won't offend me now.

804
01:02:05.988 --> 01:02:07.923
Poor man.

805
01:02:07.956 --> 01:02:10.092
He looks frightened.
you know.

806
01:02:10.125 --> 01:02:12.228
More frightened
of me dying than I am.

807
01:02:12.261 --> 01:02:16.032
He won't even talk to me
about stopping chemo.

808
01:02:16.899 --> 01:02:19.001
Are you going to?

809
01:02:19.034 --> 01:02:20.837
Well.
I'm thinking about it.

810
01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:25.274
I can handle it.
but what's the point
of even doing that.

811
01:02:25.307 --> 01:02:28.778
if I'm gonna die
the same way
no matter what?

812
01:02:28.811 --> 01:02:32.281
Steve thinks
I'd be depriving him
of time spent together.

813
01:02:35.951 --> 01:02:38.087
What would you do?

814
01:02:40.956 --> 01:02:41.991
Don't know.

815
01:02:42.024 --> 01:02:44.460
You must've thought
about it

816
01:02:45.227 --> 01:02:47.263
when you heard
about the cancer.

817
01:02:49.965 --> 01:02:51.434
Yeah. I...

818
01:02:52.868 --> 01:02:55.071
Yeah. I thought that...

819
01:02:56.438 --> 01:02:58.307
if it came to that...

820
01:02:59.341 --> 01:03:01.277
no matter how long
you'd been together.

821
01:03:01.310 --> 01:03:03.980
no matter how much
you love each other...

822
01:03:05.514 --> 01:03:09.418
it would have
to be my decision
and my decision alone.

823
01:03:12.254 --> 01:03:14.457
I cried
when I thought that.

824
01:03:17.125 --> 01:03:20.029
You know. that we're
all just really...

825
01:03:22.064 --> 01:03:23.933
just on our own.

826
01:03:32.941 --> 01:03:35.077
[exhales]

827
01:03:37.279 --> 01:03:38.180
Too hot.

828
01:03:38.213 --> 01:03:41.851
Jesus Christ.
Tea cozy?

829
01:03:41.884 --> 01:03:44.086
[chuckles]

830
01:03:41.884 --> 01:03:44.086
No!

831
01:03:47.222 --> 01:03:48.357
Oh...

832
01:03:49.491 --> 01:03:51.360
[laughs]

833
01:04:18.253 --> 01:04:21.457
You'd think
I'd give these up.
wouldn't you?

834
01:04:24.259 --> 01:04:27.296
But then what
would be the point?

835
01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:36.205
Have you somebody
in here?

836
01:04:39.174 --> 01:04:41.377
My wife.
She's got breast cancer.

837
01:04:41.410 --> 01:04:43.613
She's getting chemo.
you know.

838
01:04:52.187 --> 01:04:54.457
They're good in here.

839
01:04:55.958 --> 01:04:57.259
They can't do anything
for me.

840
01:04:57.292 --> 01:05:00.196
but that doesn't
mean to say
they're not good.

841
01:05:00.996 --> 01:05:04.100
Your wife will be
well looked after.

842
01:05:05.033 --> 01:05:06.402
Yes.

843
01:05:11.573 --> 01:05:13.409
My wife's dead.

844
01:05:17.245 --> 01:05:19.282
It's just as well.

845
01:05:30.692 --> 01:05:33.195
I can't do this. Tom.

846
01:05:36.198 --> 01:05:38.234
I can't take any more.

847
01:05:39.201 --> 01:05:41.604
It's all right. kid.
It's all right.

848
01:05:44.339 --> 01:05:46.509
I can't do it. Tom.

849
01:05:53.048 --> 01:05:54.183
Look at me.

850
01:05:54.216 --> 01:05:56.385
I don't want
to look at you.

851
01:06:00.655 --> 01:06:02.057
You're nearly there. pet.

852
01:06:02.090 --> 01:06:04.393
I don't want to be
nearly there. Tom.

853
01:06:05.327 --> 01:06:06.662
I don't wanna be
nearly there.

854
01:06:06.695 --> 01:06:10.099
I want it to be over.
I've had enough.

855
01:06:17.339 --> 01:06:20.509
You know...
you know the way...

856
01:06:22.244 --> 01:06:24.447
I always said
I'd do the marathon...

857
01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:27.583
and never did it?

858
01:06:27.616 --> 01:06:29.218
Useless.

859
01:06:29.251 --> 01:06:30.653
I'm useless.

860
01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:34.156
I stand near
the finish line...

861
01:06:35.090 --> 01:06:37.426
watching the people
cross that line...

862
01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:40.196
one by one.

863
01:06:40.829 --> 01:06:42.698
Makes me wanna cry.

864
01:06:45.667 --> 01:06:47.269
But it's...

865
01:06:48.270 --> 01:06:51.140
it's normal people
that are doing it.

866
01:06:52.774 --> 01:06:54.543
I never did it.

867
01:06:57.145 --> 01:06:58.714
You are doing it.

868
01:07:00.782 --> 01:07:03.519
You're coming up
to the finish line. Joan.

869
01:07:04.686 --> 01:07:06.589
You're nearly there. kid.

870
01:07:08.723 --> 01:07:10.593
You're gonna do it.

871
01:08:06.515 --> 01:08:09.452
I've been thinking
we should do something
to the house.

872
01:08:10.752 --> 01:08:11.754
Like what?

873
01:08:12.854 --> 01:08:14.556
I don't know.

874
01:08:14.589 --> 01:08:16.592
Bedroom. kitchen.
I don't know.
just a change.

875
01:08:16.625 --> 01:08:19.161
They don't need
change. Joan.

876
01:08:19.194 --> 01:08:21.230
Tom. we haven't
decorated since...

877
01:08:21.263 --> 01:08:23.532
And what?
There's only you
and me in it.

878
01:08:23.565 --> 01:08:25.467
It doesn't mean
it shouldn't look well.

879
01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:27.836
It looks
well enough.

880
01:08:27.869 --> 01:08:29.505
We're doing the bedroom.

881
01:08:29.538 --> 01:08:31.240
Right.
Not the kitchen?

882
01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:33.509
You think we should
do the kitchen?

883
01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:35.144
I don't think
we should do either.

884
01:08:35.177 --> 01:08:37.813
Right.
we're doing the bedroom.
Something bright.

885
01:08:37.846 --> 01:08:39.248
Aye.

886
01:08:40.882 --> 01:08:44.720
What are we doing
after this? Do you wanna go
for a drink somewhere?

887
01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:48.724
No. we'll just go up
to the bedroom.

888
01:08:49.691 --> 01:08:52.261
I'll nip over.
get some wine
across the road.

889
01:08:52.294 --> 01:08:53.529
It'll be cheaper.

890
01:08:53.562 --> 01:08:55.764
Now that we're saving
for an orange bedroom.

891
01:08:56.798 --> 01:08:59.468
We don't have
to have any drink at all.

892
01:08:59.501 --> 01:09:01.670
Aye. very good.

893
01:09:02.637 --> 01:09:04.273
Don't be getting
a lot of drink.

894
01:09:04.306 --> 01:09:05.908
I wasn't gonna
get a lot.

895
01:09:05.941 --> 01:09:07.342
Don't start.

896
01:09:07.375 --> 01:09:10.479
I know. but. I mean.
we're here doing this.

897
01:09:10.512 --> 01:09:12.681
We're having
a good time.

898
01:09:10.512 --> 01:09:12.681
Yes.

899
01:09:55.690 --> 01:09:57.860
Are you going
to miss these?

900
01:10:00.862 --> 01:10:02.798
What? Really?

901
01:10:02.831 --> 01:10:05.567
Now?

902
01:10:02.831 --> 01:10:05.567
Yes. now.

903
01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:06.702
No.

904
01:10:07.736 --> 01:10:08.537
No?

905
01:10:08.570 --> 01:10:12.474
What. is this
a trick question?

906
01:10:08.570 --> 01:10:12.474
No.

907
01:10:15.377 --> 01:10:17.580
Are you gonna
miss them?

908
01:10:26.855 --> 01:10:28.424
No.

909
01:10:30.358 --> 01:10:32.327
You'll still
have something left.

910
01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:33.629
I know.

911
01:10:36.364 --> 01:10:39.635
But. I mean.
are you gonna miss them?

912
01:10:44.072 --> 01:10:45.474
Yes.

913
01:10:48.710 --> 01:10:49.945
Good man.

914
01:11:57.479 --> 01:11:59.514
You okay?

915
01:11:57.479 --> 01:11:59.514
Yeah.

916
01:11:59.547 --> 01:12:01.850
What's the pain
like today?

917
01:11:59.547 --> 01:12:01.850
Same.

918
01:12:02.717 --> 01:12:05.587
You getting more
painkillers?

919
01:12:02.717 --> 01:12:05.587
Yeah.

920
01:12:07.021 --> 01:12:08.657
Did you sleep?

921
01:12:10.024 --> 01:12:11.593
Off and on.

922
01:12:12.727 --> 01:12:15.464
It's difficult
to sleep here.
noise of the place.

923
01:12:16.464 --> 01:12:20.435
How long did they say
you'd be in for?

924
01:12:16.464 --> 01:12:20.435
At least a week.

925
01:12:20.468 --> 01:12:26.508
Got to make sure
that the wound's clean and
under my arms are all drained.

926
01:12:27.409 --> 01:12:29.878
Do you need me
to bring anything up?

927
01:12:29.911 --> 01:12:31.079
Yeah.

928
01:12:31.112 --> 01:12:34.449
Can you go into
the top drawer and get
my blue nightdress?

929
01:12:34.482 --> 01:12:35.851
Make sure
it's the blue one.

930
01:12:35.884 --> 01:12:38.754
The other one's
a bit grubby.
And some knickers.

931
01:12:41.022 --> 01:12:42.858
Any type?

932
01:12:42.891 --> 01:12:44.626
Crotchless?

933
01:12:47.462 --> 01:12:49.765
Don't make me laugh.
It hurts.

934
01:12:50.899 --> 01:12:52.167
Not the crotchless
then?

935
01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:54.169
Oh. Tom!

936
01:12:54.202 --> 01:12:56.471
Sturdy gusset?

937
01:12:56.504 --> 01:12:58.707
Sturdy gusset.

938
01:13:00.909 --> 01:13:03.112
Couple of facecloths
as well.

939
01:13:03.945 --> 01:13:04.913
Anything else?

940
01:13:04.946 --> 01:13:07.850
Any other things
that aren't
sexually romantic?

941
01:13:08.783 --> 01:13:11.920
No. just the sexually
romantic stuff.

942
01:13:16.124 --> 01:13:17.526
Hi.

943
01:13:18.059 --> 01:13:19.528
Tom. this is Peter.

944
01:13:19.561 --> 01:13:21.029
[Tom]
Yes. of course.

945
01:13:19.561 --> 01:13:21.029
[Joan] I told you.

946
01:13:21.062 --> 01:13:24.065
Hi.
Good to meet you.

947
01:13:21.062 --> 01:13:24.065
You too.

948
01:13:24.098 --> 01:13:28.103
I'm gonna go down
to the café.
Let you two have a chat.

949
01:13:31.239 --> 01:13:33.175
Well.
how about you.
missus?

950
01:13:33.208 --> 01:13:37.779
They've removed both
of my breasts and they've
reconstructed them.

951
01:13:37.812 --> 01:13:41.450
They pulled up
some muscle from
my stomach to do it.

952
01:13:41.483 --> 01:13:44.820
I've got this great big
scar across here.
It's like a zip.

953
01:13:46.187 --> 01:13:48.557
Well.
at least it's over.

954
01:13:51.559 --> 01:13:54.930
You know.
at the start of all this.
I had this feeling

955
01:13:54.963 --> 01:13:58.600
that if I can get
through it all.
that the experience of that.

956
01:13:58.633 --> 01:14:00.869
you know.
just going through it.

957
01:14:00.902 --> 01:14:03.105
it would somehow
change me.

958
01:14:05.607 --> 01:14:07.709
I don't think it has.

959
01:14:09.744 --> 01:14:11.947
I don't think
I want it to.

960
01:14:50.752 --> 01:14:53.188
You're Tom.
Joan's husband?

961
01:14:58.793 --> 01:15:01.730
Peter is with Joan
up in the ward.

962
01:15:01.763 --> 01:15:03.232
Oh. right. yeah.

963
01:15:04.766 --> 01:15:09.004
I heard she was in
for an operation.
I hope it all went well.

964
01:15:09.037 --> 01:15:12.007
In doctor speak.
as well as can be expected.

965
01:15:13.207 --> 01:15:15.978
I know.
It's just never
a straight answer.

966
01:15:17.779 --> 01:15:20.048
It's good that
she got through it.

967
01:15:17.779 --> 01:15:20.048
Yeah.

968
01:15:22.183 --> 01:15:25.086
Peter's in because
his blood count
is down.

969
01:15:25.119 --> 01:15:27.656
Aye.
just keeping an eye
on him.

970
01:15:32.126 --> 01:15:33.795
He's dying.

971
01:15:34.662 --> 01:15:35.898
You know that?

972
01:15:38.132 --> 01:15:39.668
Yes.

973
01:15:41.636 --> 01:15:43.238
I've stopped
the chemo.

974
01:15:43.271 --> 01:15:47.576
I knew I was going to do it.
I just took me time
working round to it.

975
01:15:48.710 --> 01:15:52.214
I told Steve.
I didn't talk to him
about it. I told him.

976
01:15:53.815 --> 01:15:55.717
That didn't
go down well.

977
01:15:57.385 --> 01:15:59.121
He'll come round.

978
01:15:59.988 --> 01:16:03.225
Well. he'll have to.
It's all about time now.

979
01:16:10.732 --> 01:16:13.068
He used to teach
my daughter.

980
01:16:14.402 --> 01:16:15.971
Aye. He said.

981
01:16:16.938 --> 01:16:19.007
I'm sorry to hear
what happened.

982
01:16:19.741 --> 01:16:21.076
Yeah.

983
01:16:22.744 --> 01:16:24.713
That can't be easy.

984
01:16:26.114 --> 01:16:27.249
No.

985
01:16:28.383 --> 01:16:31.119
[Joan]  Have you planned out
what you're gonna do?

986
01:16:31.886 --> 01:16:33.355
Do nothing.

987
01:16:33.388 --> 01:16:36.057
You know.
spend time together.
I don't want to do things.

988
01:16:36.090 --> 01:16:37.959
I've spent me whole life
doing things.

989
01:16:37.992 --> 01:16:41.096
Now I want to do
absolutely nothing.

990
01:16:44.098 --> 01:16:47.402
Yeah. when we lost Debbie.
I think Tom felt like that.

991
01:16:47.435 --> 01:16:50.138
Just gave up work
and...

992
01:16:51.406 --> 01:16:53.909
stopped. really.
Well...

993
01:16:54.876 --> 01:16:56.812
I suppose I did too.

994
01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.882
I understand that.

995
01:17:07.055 --> 01:17:09.257
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

996
01:17:11.826 --> 01:17:14.696
I don't think anyone
knows that.

997
01:17:14.729 --> 01:17:18.767
You try not to think
about it. but it's there
all the time.

998
01:17:23.071 --> 01:17:24.206
Maybe...

999
01:17:25.039 --> 01:17:26.875
you don't do anything.

1000
01:17:28.376 --> 01:17:33.948
Look... I don't know
if this is any good.
but I'll say it anyway.

1001
01:17:33.981 --> 01:17:36.918
My daughter. Debbie.
was taken away
from us suddenly.

1002
01:17:36.951 --> 01:17:38.753
I can't explain it.

1003
01:17:38.786 --> 01:17:40.288
It's beyond me.

1004
01:17:41.889 --> 01:17:44.126
But if I'd have known
she was going to die...

1005
01:17:45.093 --> 01:17:49.131
all I would've done
was to spend time with her.

1006
01:17:53.935 --> 01:17:56.038
I don't want him
to die.

1007
01:18:00.208 --> 01:18:01.910
I know.

1008
01:18:05.313 --> 01:18:06.882
I know.

1009
01:18:29.437 --> 01:18:31.840
Oh. thank you.

1010
01:18:39.247 --> 01:18:41.383
Here. fix this tie.
will you?

1011
01:18:42.283 --> 01:18:44.219
A grown man
can't fix
his own tie.

1012
01:18:44.252 --> 01:18:46.821
What's that
about?

1013
01:18:44.252 --> 01:18:46.821
[chuckles]

1014
01:18:46.854 --> 01:18:48.189
You look well. kid.

1015
01:18:48.222 --> 01:18:50.926
-Thank you.
-Are you not meant
to say that back?

1016
01:18:51.526 --> 01:18:52.761
You look well.

1017
01:18:52.794 --> 01:18:54.129
Too late.

1018
01:18:58.866 --> 01:19:01.302
We'll just stay
for the funeral. okay?

1019
01:19:01.335 --> 01:19:02.837
I'm tired.

1020
01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:05.106
Joan. if you don't
want to go...

1021
01:19:05.139 --> 01:19:07.242
Oh. no.
I do want to go.

1022
01:19:07.275 --> 01:19:09.844
But I don't want
to get involved
in anything afterwards.

1023
01:19:09.877 --> 01:19:12.013
Are you in pain?

1024
01:19:09.877 --> 01:19:12.013
Yeah. a bit.

1025
01:19:12.046 --> 01:19:15.116
Take another tablet.

1026
01:19:12.046 --> 01:19:15.116
Oh. I will later.

1027
01:19:15.149 --> 01:19:18.053
I'm trying to hold off.
I'm taking too many
as it is.

1028
01:19:19.187 --> 01:19:22.057
-Do you want a cup of tea?
-Yes. please.

1029
01:19:42.276 --> 01:19:46.047
[Steve] The last few weeks
of Peter and I's
time together was...

1030
01:19:47.381 --> 01:19:49.217
was beautiful.

1031
01:19:49.250 --> 01:19:53.922
I've never watched
so much rubbish TV
in my life.

1032
01:19:53.955 --> 01:19:55.523
[scattered chuckles]

1033
01:19:55.556 --> 01:19:57.926
It's brilliant.
rubbish TV.

1034
01:19:59.927 --> 01:20:02.130
All we did
was sit together.

1035
01:20:03.097 --> 01:20:05.267
That's all
we needed to do.

1036
01:20:07.535 --> 01:20:11.139
I've never loved any person
as much as I loved that man.

1037
01:20:14.342 --> 01:20:18.313
He made me
face the world and...

1038
01:20:20.414 --> 01:20:23.285
I will miss him more
than he will ever know.

1039
01:20:26.087 --> 01:20:28.056
Peter. I love you.

1040
01:20:30.358 --> 01:20:34.095
I don't know
what I'm gonna do
without you. but...

1041
01:20:34.128 --> 01:20:39.167
I do know that
you're still forever
the best part of me.

1042
01:20:58.452 --> 01:21:01.623
Hey. that's too many.
Can you not just
get a few?

1043
01:21:01.656 --> 01:21:05.026
No. You need
more than a few.

1044
01:21:01.656 --> 01:21:05.026
There's only the two of us.

1045
01:21:05.059 --> 01:21:07.095
You can't just
cook a few
Brussels sprouts.

1046
01:21:07.128 --> 01:21:08.663
Why not?

1047
01:21:08.696 --> 01:21:12.367
Oh. I don't know.
You just can't.

1048
01:21:08.696 --> 01:21:12.367
Why do we even have to get any?

1049
01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:14.502
I don't even
eat them.

1050
01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:14.502
I do.

1051
01:21:14.535 --> 01:21:17.171
Once a year.
You eat them
once a year.

1052
01:21:17.204 --> 01:21:19.207
Well. that's why
it's important
to get them.

1053
01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:20.642
Anyway.
what do you care?

1054
01:21:20.675 --> 01:21:22.377
They stink
the place up.

1055
01:21:22.410 --> 01:21:25.313
You stink
the place up.

1056
01:21:22.410 --> 01:21:25.313
Very good.

1057
01:21:25.346 --> 01:21:28.116
I'm gonna head
around here
and get some beer.

1058
01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:31.219
Have we enough wine?

1059
01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:31.219
Yes. plenty of wine.

1060
01:21:31.252 --> 01:21:34.389
Running out
over Christmas
would be a nightmare.

1061
01:21:34.422 --> 01:21:37.125
Don't get
too much beer.

1062
01:21:34.422 --> 01:21:37.125
I'll get what I need.

1063
01:21:37.158 --> 01:21:39.060
I'm just saying
don't get too much.

1064
01:21:39.093 --> 01:21:40.361
Ditto regarding
the sprouts.

1065
01:21:40.394 --> 01:21:42.263
Oh. get some
smoked salmon.
will you?

1066
01:21:42.296 --> 01:21:44.399
Oh. aye?
Just a wee bit
for you?

1067
01:21:44.432 --> 01:21:45.567
[Tom] Aye.

1068
01:21:58.579 --> 01:21:59.780
[chuckles]

1069
01:22:01.582 --> 01:22:05.219
Put a wee bit of tinsel
round the goldfish tank
too. will you?

1070
01:22:05.252 --> 01:22:07.622
I will if I've got
enough left.

1071
01:22:07.655 --> 01:22:10.492
The fish needs to know
it's Christmas.

1072
01:22:07.655 --> 01:22:10.492
Oh. aye.

1073
01:22:23.671 --> 01:22:26.307
You want
some more wine?

1074
01:22:23.671 --> 01:22:26.307
No. I'm all right.

1075
01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:28.310
Got enough there.
thanks.

1076
01:22:30.444 --> 01:22:33.481
Know what I was thinking?

1077
01:22:30.444 --> 01:22:33.481
No. Tom.
What were you thinking?

1078
01:22:35.716 --> 01:22:39.254
We should invite
your man Steve
over for Christmas.

1079
01:22:41.422 --> 01:22:43.424
Yeah.
that's a good idea.

1080
01:22:43.457 --> 01:22:45.627
I do have them
sometimes.

1081
01:22:47.495 --> 01:22:49.998
Not Christmas dinner
though.

1082
01:22:50.031 --> 01:22:52.767
I hadn't thought when.
but why not
Christmas dinner?

1083
01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:56.771
Well. I'm sure
he's got other places
to be anyway.

1084
01:22:56.804 --> 01:22:58.339
He might be on his own.

1085
01:22:58.372 --> 01:23:00.742
He mightn't want
to come out
on Christmas Day.

1086
01:23:02.043 --> 01:23:04.645
Maybe. but how do you
know that unless you ask him?

1087
01:23:04.678 --> 01:23:09.083
You ask him. then he says.
"I can. I can't.
I want to. I don't want to."

1088
01:23:09.116 --> 01:23:12.487
Yeah. but he might
feel under pressure
if we ask him.

1089
01:23:13.354 --> 01:23:15.289
Why don't you leave
the decision up to him

1090
01:23:15.322 --> 01:23:16.758
instead of you
making it for him?

1091
01:23:16.791 --> 01:23:20.595
Even though we haven't
even asked him
the question yet.

1092
01:23:24.231 --> 01:23:26.634
All right.
but just not
Christmas Day.

1093
01:23:26.667 --> 01:23:29.737
A drink then.
Invite him round
for a drink.

1094
01:23:29.770 --> 01:23:32.106
Yeah. that would
be lovely.

1095
01:23:32.139 --> 01:23:34.542
Okay. You have
his number?

1096
01:23:32.139 --> 01:23:34.542
Yeah.

1097
01:23:35.509 --> 01:23:38.580
Will you phone him
or will I?

1098
01:23:35.509 --> 01:23:38.580
You can phone him.

1099
01:23:39.513 --> 01:23:40.615
Right.

1100
01:23:42.249 --> 01:23:43.651
I know what
we've just said.

1101
01:23:43.684 --> 01:23:46.421
and I'm not saying
this will happen. but...

1102
01:23:46.454 --> 01:23:47.555
Tom...

1103
01:23:48.756 --> 01:23:52.160
if you want to
ask him for Christmas.
ask him for Christmas.

1104
01:23:52.193 --> 01:23:54.128
Okay. Hey...

1105
01:23:54.161 --> 01:23:55.530
do we have enough
Brussels sprouts?

1106
01:23:55.563 --> 01:23:57.699
[laughs]
More than enough.
