00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.294
[man 1] Hey. Gibson. Come over here. mate.

[weapon thuds]

8
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.422
Whoa. You still lugging that thing around?

9
00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:50.884
[Gibson] Hey. I'm gonna be ready
when Zorah Magdaros finally shows itself.

10
00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:54.888
I mean. you really think you're gonna kill
a walking volcano monster with that?

11
00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:58.224
This thing can supposedly level cities
with a wag of its tail.

12
00:00:58.308 --> 00:01:00.351
Gibson. if half the rumors are true.

13
00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:03.188
you may wanna count yourself lucky
that it hasn't shown itself yet.

14
00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:06.691
-We're the Fifth Fleet. Best of the best!
-[laughs] I'll drink to that!

15
00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:09.569
Zorah Magdaros
had better keep its head underwater

16
00:01:09.652 --> 00:01:12.947
because no one's met the monster
that can handle Hunters like us.

Morning. Mrs. Bellflower.

32

Morning. Aiden. You're out early.

33
00:02:16.427 --> 00:02:19.889
You know what they say.
"The early Kut-Ku catches the Konchu."

34
00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:21.641
[Bellflower]
I did not know they said that.

35
00:02:21.724 --> 00:02:22.642
You and your monsters.

36
00:02:22.725 --> 00:02:24.644
[chuckles] Nice-lookin' catch. Aiden.

37
00:02:24.727 --> 00:02:27.313
How about a Gastronome Tuna
for some Poogie Jammies?

38
00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:28.565
[man 1] Not gonna happen!

-[Poogie squeals]
-Whoa!

40
00:02:30.024 --> 00:02:33.027

-[man 2] Whoa! Nice move. Aiden.

41
00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:35.488
-You must be practicing.
-[Aiden] You better believe it.

42
00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:38.366
Thanks again
for clearing out those Bnahabra.

43
00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:41.244
Hopefully.
these patches'll keep 'em out for good.

44
00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:43.246
[Aiden] Always "Bna-happy" to help.

45
00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:45.957
[man 3] Hey. have you seen Farmer Burl?

46
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.420
Ooh! Ebbi's been waiting
for you there all morning.

47
00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:52.463
[Ebbi]
Something's gotten in Farmer Burl's coops.

48
00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:55.091
-Come on. We gotta go. It's a real quest!
-[Aiden grunts]

49
00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:56.259
What if it's Rathalos?

50
00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:58.803
Did you know that Rathalos
have poisonous claws? [growls]

51
00:02:58.887 --> 00:03:01.347
-Yeah?
-One scratch. and you're a goner.

52
00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:04.726
[chuckles] I kinda doubt a Rathalos
got into Farmer Burl's Gargwa coops.

53
00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:07.145
I'd bring some antidotes anyway.

54
00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:09.731
Yes.

55
00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.362
Whoa! [laughs]

56
00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:18.489
Mrs. Genovan. look.

57
00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:23.077
[Genovan] Is that my cast-iron skillet?

Just finished putting the new fence in
last week. and now look at it.

Tracks.

64
00:03:48.436 --> 00:03:50.355
Velociprey. I think.

65
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.068
Can you take care of it?

66
00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:58.279
Mr. Burl. you called
the "Right-noplos" guy for the job.

67
00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:01.908
Because Rhenoplos. it's a…

68
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:04.244
With the horn? Never mind.

Ah. Whew.

100
00:06:19.712 --> 00:06:22.215
[chuckles softly] That… That was close.

101
00:06:22.715 --> 00:06:25.093
You're fortunate
the Velocidrome was alone.

102
00:06:25.176 --> 00:06:27.637
They usually hunt
with a pack of Velociprey.

103
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.431
Yikes. The tracks
I was following were a Velociprey's.

104
00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:33.101
Didn't think
I'd be running into its big brother.

105
00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:35.937
Are you a Hunter?

106
00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:38.356
You are. aren't you?

107
00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:40.149
Like. a real Guild Hunter.

108
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.404
The last time one came through Timben.
I was. like. nine years old.

109
00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:46.697
This is so cool. I'm a Hunter too.

110
00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:50.993
I mean. well. I've never actually hunted
something that can hunt back before. but…

111
00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:54.122
-I'm Aiden. by the way.
-My name is Julius.

112
00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:57.208
You shouldn't be hunting
without a license from the Hunter's Guild.

113
00:06:57.291 --> 00:06:59.085
-It's poaching.
-[Aiden] I… Well…

114
00:06:59.168 --> 00:07:01.796
One of them Velociprey…

115
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.464
What are you doing?

116
00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:06.342
One does not take
a monster's life lightly.

117
00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:08.719
To do so
would betray the balance of nature.

118
00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:12.807
A Hunter has an obligation
to see its sacrifice does not go to waste.

119
00:07:13.724 --> 00:07:16.727
Now. this village
you're from. it's nearby?

120
00:07:16.811 --> 00:07:18.563
I'm not in trouble. am I?

121
00:07:18.646 --> 00:07:21.232
I mean. you killed it. right? So…

122
00:07:22.817 --> 00:07:25.111
Here's the thing.
The last time one of the villagers

123
00:07:25.194 --> 00:07:27.447
got an Altaroth infestation
in their basement.

124
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.574
Mitul had to walk all the way to Dundorma.

125
00:07:29.657 --> 00:07:30.908
It took two weeks!

126
00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:33.286
And then. when we finally met
with the Hunter's Guild.

127
00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:35.246
they'd never even heard of
our village before.

128
00:07:35.746 --> 00:07:37.874
There's no way
we can go for help every time a Kelbi

129
00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:39.500
gets into the Cudgel Onion patch.

130
00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:42.753
Ah. So you take it upon yourself
to sort things out.

131
00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:45.173
I'm actually pretty good at this stuff.

132
00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:51.721
Are these the Velociprey tracks
you were following?

133
00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:56.851
Yep. Those are them.
Somebody's still gotta deal with that.

134
00:07:58.019 --> 00:08:00.062
These are fake.

135
00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:01.022
What?

136
00:08:01.105 --> 00:08:02.482
And from the looks of it.

137
00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:04.692
you have a Melynx
to thank for all your troubles.

138
00:08:04.775 --> 00:08:06.986
Oh. When I find him. I'm gonna--

139
00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:09.739
Aiden. later. The village first.

140
00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:11.032
But… [scoffs]

141
00:08:11.115 --> 00:08:12.366
This isn't over.

142
00:08:13.242 --> 00:08:15.620
[Julius] Is there someone
who makes decisions for the village?

143
00:08:15.703 --> 00:08:17.955
[Aiden] Elder Daazel. She's a Wyverian.

144
00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:19.957
Lived here
longer than there's been a village.

145
00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:22.210
She's in the building
with Huskberry bushes out front.

146
00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:25.713
-I can show you where it is.
-[Julius] I'll find my way. Take this.

147

-[Ebbi] Holy moly!

149
00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:42.063
Keep an eye on that
for me. would you. Ebbi?

150
00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:46.317
I'll be back shortly.

151
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.402
[Gargwa clucking]

152
00:08:50.738 --> 00:08:53.449
Give it a rest. Feathers.
I'm not quite ready for you yet.

00:09:09.131 --> 00:09:11.884
Mm! A little Felvine for flavor.

156
00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:13.386
-[Aiden] Aha!
-[Melynx yelps]

157
00:09:13.469 --> 00:09:15.680
Don't you move.
You're gonna pay for what you've done.

158
00:09:15.763 --> 00:09:19.141
Why. certainly. good sir.
Uh. how much do I owe you?

159
00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:21.519
You're a… Wait. you can talk?

160
00:09:21.602 --> 00:09:24.063
I thought wild Melynx
only spoke Melynx or whatever.

161
00:09:24.146 --> 00:09:27.650
"Meowst" do. uh. that's true.
But I'm not as wild as some.

162
00:09:27.733 --> 00:09:28.818
I'm a merchant.

163
00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:30.236
Nox is the name.

164
00:09:30.319 --> 00:09:33.155
Really? Then what are you doing
with Farmer Burl's--? [yelps]

165
00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:35.449

Oh my--

170
00:09:42.123 --> 00:09:43.833
Yeah. just put that anywhere.

171
00:09:43.916 --> 00:09:45.084
Just don't hit the--

172
00:09:45.167 --> 00:09:46.419
Oh! Come on!

173
00:09:46.502 --> 00:09:48.713
-That is precious cargo.
-[Aiden grunts] Ow!

174
00:09:48.796 --> 00:09:50.965
That was a limited-edition pot!

175
00:09:51.048 --> 00:09:53.593
-What kind of-- Oh. real nice.
-[Aiden continues grunting]

176
00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:55.136
You "meowster"!

177
00:09:55.219 --> 00:09:57.763
Come back here. you furry little felon!

178
00:09:58.347 --> 00:10:00.349
-[sighs]
-[Nox yelps. grunts]

179
00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:02.435
-[Gargwa clucking]
-[Aiden exhales]

180
00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:04.937
Ah.

181
00:10:13.946 --> 00:10:18.326
I don't suppose I could interest you
in an array of secondhand commodities?

182
00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:22.580
[Nox. muffled] All right. 15. uh. 20%.
but that is the best I can do.

183
00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.541
For the last time.
I'm not interested in your Zenny.

184
00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:28.544
"Your Zenny."
Listen to me. buying into this Bullfango.

185
00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:31.797
-[Nox groans] Unnecessary.
-[sighs] You're a thief.

186
00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:35.718
I'm a Hunter. and bringing you in
is gonna prove to that Guild know-it-all

187
00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:37.094
that I can protect my village.

188
00:10:37.178 --> 00:10:39.847
[Nox] Oh. I get it. You're a protector.

189
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:41.182
-You protect.
-That's right.

190
00:10:41.265 --> 00:10:42.141
[Nox] Hear me out.

191
00:10:42.224 --> 00:10:44.393
How much more effective
would you be as a protector

192
00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:48.022
if you could just protect them
with your very own airship?

193
00:10:48.105 --> 00:10:49.690
Now. I… I know a guy…

194
00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:50.733
[Burl] Hi.

195
00:10:50.816 --> 00:10:53.736
[calming instrumental music playing]

196
00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:55.946
[doors squeak]

197
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.491
Well. Mr. Burl. I've solved your problem.

198
00:10:58.574 --> 00:11:00.284
I think
you'll be pleased to have these back.

199
00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:02.745
-My Gargwa!
-[chuckles] Nice. Aiden.

200
00:11:02.828 --> 00:11:04.538
Heck of a good job. son.

201
00:11:05.164 --> 00:11:07.833
-[Nox groans. coughs]
-And the thief responsible.

202
00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:08.751
Uh. hello.

203
00:11:08.834 --> 00:11:10.378
[villager] Yeah. Aiden!

204
00:11:11.045 --> 00:11:12.755
Still think I shouldn't be hunting?

205
00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:14.548
-Yes.
-[Julius grunts]

206
00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:17.385
-[Nox] Oof.
-What's all this?

207
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:21.347
I was just explaining

208
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:24.266
that your village lies
in the path of an Elder Dragon.

209
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:25.226
What?

210
00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:27.311
What does that mean?

211
00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:29.063
Nothing good.

212
00:11:29.146 --> 00:11:32.274
The Elder Dragons are the most ancient

213
00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:35.152
and powerful of monster kind.

214
00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:39.615
Once enraged.
incredible energy flows from them.

215
00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:43.911
warping ecosystems
in the places where they live.

216
00:11:43.994 --> 00:11:46.789
[Julius] For the most part.
these creatures remain in one place.

217
00:11:46.872 --> 00:11:48.666
However. during the periodic migration.

218
00:11:48.749 --> 00:11:52.044
called the Elder Crossing.
they migrate across the continent

219
00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:53.546
and over the great ocean.

220
00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:56.340
leaving a path
of destruction in their wake.

221
00:11:56.882 --> 00:12:00.678
Based on our reports. we now believe
they are all headed to the same location

222
00:12:00.761 --> 00:12:03.597
over the sea. but we don't know why.

223
00:12:04.306 --> 00:12:05.224
[Aptonoth cries]

224
00:12:05.307 --> 00:12:07.518
[Daazel] For most of recorded history.

225
00:12:07.601 --> 00:12:10.688
these events were extraordinarily rare.

226
00:12:10.771 --> 00:12:13.899
-[people scream]
-[Daazel] One in a century was uncommon.

227
00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:17.570
It's now happening once every decade.

228
00:12:17.653 --> 00:12:19.655
[Julius] Ten years ago.
the Guild summoned Hunters

229
00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:21.532
to Port Tanzia to join a Fleet.

230
00:12:22.032 --> 00:12:22.867
Their mission?

231
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:25.953
To find the cause
of the more frequent migrations.

232
00:12:26.454 --> 00:12:27.663
Hunters. like myself.

233
00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:31.709
have been dispatched by the Hunter's Guild
to search for signs of the next migration.

234
00:12:32.209 --> 00:12:33.377
I am here to tell you

235
00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:36.255
an Elder Dragon is on its migration path.

236
00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:38.507
straight for your village.

237
00:12:39.216 --> 00:12:40.050
Holy moly.

238
00:12:40.134 --> 00:12:42.303
You must evacuate now.

239
00:12:42.386 --> 00:12:46.432
Wait a minute.
You expect us to just pack up and leave?

240
00:12:46.515 --> 00:12:48.893
How do we know any of this is even true?

241
00:12:48.976 --> 00:12:52.563
-We don't know you.
-I agree. What about our homes?

242
00:12:52.646 --> 00:12:55.691
-Did you think of that?
-Homes? Homes can be rebuilt.

243
00:12:55.775 --> 00:12:59.069
We're talking about lives here.
We should do as he says.

244
00:12:59.153 --> 00:13:03.616
Some of us can't carry our livelihood
with us. Navid. I don't trust this man.

245
00:13:03.699 --> 00:13:06.160
No. I don't either.
I mean. why should we listen to him?

246
00:13:06.243 --> 00:13:07.161
It's true.

247
00:13:07.244 --> 00:13:11.332
This valley is acting like a funnel
for monsters fleeing the Elder Dragon.

248
00:13:11.415 --> 00:13:13.501
-Most likely--
-Most likely?

249
00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:14.710
He's just guessing!

250
00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:16.170
I believe him.

251
00:13:16.921 --> 00:13:17.880
He saved my life.

252
00:13:17.963 --> 00:13:20.674
Aiden. he's not from our village.

253
00:13:22.718 --> 00:13:25.012
What if I go up there
and see this for myself?

254
00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:29.391
Well. if you tell us
the danger is real. I will believe you.

255
00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:30.893
Okay. I will too.

256
00:13:30.976 --> 00:13:32.436
Then you will evacuate?

257
00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.604
We have to know.

258
00:13:35.314 --> 00:13:36.482
Take me there.

259
00:13:37.149 --> 00:13:40.319
The Elder Dragon will pass
through the valley within a week.

260
00:13:40.402 --> 00:13:41.821
I will take the boy

261
00:13:41.904 --> 00:13:44.365
to see with his own eyes
the coming danger.

262
00:13:44.448 --> 00:13:46.784
but there can be no delay
in your preparations.

263
00:13:46.867 --> 00:13:49.745
You must be ready to leave
as soon as he returns.

264
00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:52.414
We will begin at first light.

265
00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:54.124
[Burl] This doesn't sound good.

266
00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:55.584
What are you going to do?

267
00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:57.294
[villagers chattering]

268
00:13:57.378 --> 00:14:00.631
-[Nox yowls]
-Now. what to do with you?

269
00:14:00.714 --> 00:14:02.883
I may have use for him.

270
00:14:03.759 --> 00:14:04.677
Huh?

271
00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:06.595
[groans]

272
00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:08.681
Oh! [grunts]

273
00:14:08.764 --> 00:14:10.766
[tense instrumental music playing]

274
00:14:14.645 --> 00:14:15.980
[Burl groans]

275
00:14:19.608 --> 00:14:22.236
[birds singing]

276
00:14:22.319 --> 00:14:24.321
[monsters grunting and snorting]

277
00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:34.415
-Have you hunted Zinogre?
-[Julius] Yes.

278
00:14:34.498 --> 00:14:35.916
-Diablos?
-Yes.

279
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.836
-[monsters buzzing]
-[Aiden screams]

280
00:14:38.919 --> 00:14:40.004
Ha-ha!

281
00:14:40.087 --> 00:14:40.963
Aiden. no!

282
00:14:41.046 --> 00:14:42.214
I had that one.

283
00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:45.384
These monsters are no threat.

284
00:14:45.467 --> 00:14:47.219
They're fleeing the Elder Dragon.

285
00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:48.637
[Nox screams]

286
00:14:50.306 --> 00:14:51.724
[swords ringing]

287
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.352
[Aiden panting]

288
00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:06.488
There's something I don't get.
How come the Guild gets to decide

289
00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:08.490
when and what people can hunt?

290
00:15:08.574 --> 00:15:10.326
A dead monster's a dead monster. isn't it?

291
00:15:10.409 --> 00:15:12.369
Most people once agreed with you.

292
00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:15.080
Ages ago.
we hunted monsters indiscriminately

293
00:15:15.164 --> 00:15:18.792
to the point where the natural balance
of life was disrupted.

294
00:15:19.293 --> 00:15:22.087
The effect
on our environment was devastating.

295
00:15:22.838 --> 00:15:26.091
It is this very reason
that the Hunter's Guild was formed.

296
00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:30.054
Our balance with nature
is more delicate than you think.

297
00:15:32.097 --> 00:15:33.223
[softly] Whoa.

298
00:15:33.307 --> 00:15:34.683
[Julius] Dual Blades.

299
00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:36.894
They work separately. but always together.

300
00:15:36.977 --> 00:15:38.145
Always on the offensive.

301
00:15:38.228 --> 00:15:42.191
Overwhelming and outnumbering
one's opponent like two unrelenting foes.

302
00:15:42.274 --> 00:15:44.568
The motion is fluid and precise.

303
00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:46.737
like the flow of a stream.

304
00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.156
-May I?
-Here. Try these first.

305
00:15:49.239 --> 00:15:51.200
[rhythmic instrumental music playing]

306
00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:52.493
[sighs]

307
00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:55.537
[grunting. groans]

308
00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:58.916
Concentrate on your center.
You need a stable foundation.

309
00:16:00.084 --> 00:16:01.001
[Aiden sighs]

310
00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:03.087
Don't worry.

311
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:05.547
We may make a decent Hunter of you yet.

312
00:16:10.511 --> 00:16:13.722
[Nox panting] Hey. Hey. guys. Wait.

313
00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:17.643
Isn't this distribution
of baggage just a little unfair?

314
00:16:17.726 --> 00:16:19.103
[sighing] Oh God.

315
00:16:20.771 --> 00:16:21.981
Nice armor.

316
00:16:23.023 --> 00:16:24.650
[laughs] You noticed.

317
00:16:24.733 --> 00:16:26.276
It's 100% iron ore.

318
00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:30.072
Velocidrome-tested.
Works as a weapon. Got good balance.

319
00:16:31.865 --> 00:16:33.075
Campfire cookware.

320
00:16:33.701 --> 00:16:35.744
Perhaps you need to look the part.

321
00:16:37.287 --> 00:16:38.372
This could fit.

322
00:16:38.455 --> 00:16:40.082
[gasps. chuckles] Thank you.

323
00:16:40.165 --> 00:16:41.667
-[skillet clangs]
-[Nox yowls]

324
00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:43.335
[Julius] It is Guild-issue.

325
00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:46.964
-Come here.
-[Julius] Aiden.

326
00:16:47.047 --> 00:16:48.132
Come on. Bring it in.

327
00:16:48.215 --> 00:16:50.175
Um. no. No. Aiden.

328
00:16:50.259 --> 00:16:52.594
It's okay. Don't… Don't touch me.

329
00:17:05.065 --> 00:17:07.609
In case you were wondering… [yawns]

330
00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:11.530
…there's nowhere you can run
that I won't be able to track you. Nox.

331
00:17:11.613 --> 00:17:14.408
[gasps] Say what? Uh-oh. No. No.

332
00:17:14.491 --> 00:17:18.412
-[rustling]
-[Julius] Mm-hmm. And get out of my bag.

333
00:17:18.495 --> 00:17:20.831
[Nox] Who. me?
I'm not. I'm right over here.

334
00:17:20.914 --> 00:17:22.166
[rustling in bushes]

335
00:17:24.585 --> 00:17:25.461
What?

336
00:17:25.961 --> 00:17:27.296
I don't see anything.

337
00:17:27.379 --> 00:17:28.213
[Julius] Quiet.

338
00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:32.009
-[Velociprey screeches]
-[footsteps approaching]

339
00:17:32.092 --> 00:17:32.968
Uh…

340
00:17:33.761 --> 00:17:34.636
Run!

341
00:17:35.262 --> 00:17:36.346
[Velociprey crying]

342
00:17:37.765 --> 00:17:38.891
[Aiden] Nox!

343
00:17:38.974 --> 00:17:40.100
[Nox yelps]

344
00:17:40.684 --> 00:17:41.769
Aiden. no!

345
00:17:41.852 --> 00:17:43.771
[tense instrumental music playing]

346
00:17:43.854 --> 00:17:44.855
[Velociprey roars]

347
00:17:46.565 --> 00:17:47.733
[Aiden screams]

348
00:17:50.402 --> 00:17:51.570
Come on!

349
00:17:52.654 --> 00:17:53.655
Climb up here!

350
00:17:55.032 --> 00:17:57.910
That was the scariest thing
I've ever seen.

351
00:17:57.993 --> 00:18:00.662
It can't get any worse than that.
[chuckles]

352
00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:02.539
Aiden. come up here.

353
00:18:03.874 --> 00:18:07.169
[Aiden grunts] What's that smell?

354
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:08.837
[Nox] Oof.

355
00:18:10.297 --> 00:18:12.007
Ugh. [groans]

356
00:18:13.008 --> 00:18:13.842
Oh!

357
00:18:14.885 --> 00:18:16.136
I was incorrect. It's…

358
00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:18.013
-Uh. yeah. it's worse.
-[thunder rumbles]

359
00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:19.348
[Aiden] Holy moly.

360
00:18:19.431 --> 00:18:20.724
[gasps] What is that?

361
00:18:21.892 --> 00:18:23.727
That is what you face.

362
00:18:23.811 --> 00:18:24.937
An Elder Dragon.

363
00:18:25.562 --> 00:18:28.357
An unbridled force of nature given flesh.

364
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.567
headed directly for your village.

365
00:18:30.651 --> 00:18:32.569
[dramatic orchestral music playing]

366
00:18:33.612 --> 00:18:34.822
[Aiden gasps]

367
00:18:36.198 --> 00:18:40.160
Aiden. you have. at most. three days
until your village is destroyed.

368
00:18:41.453 --> 00:18:43.455
[Lunastra growling]

369
00:18:53.715 --> 00:18:55.717
[fire crackling]

370
00:19:02.182 --> 00:19:03.684
[flames roaring]

371
00:19:03.767 --> 00:19:05.853
That's an Elder Dragon?

372
00:19:05.936 --> 00:19:09.314
I've tracked it for almost a month.
Your people must leave the valley at once.

373
00:19:09.398 --> 00:19:12.526
We'll never make it.
The only way out is through the Everwood.

374
00:19:12.609 --> 00:19:15.028
-We'd run right into it.
-Then you must go west.

375
00:19:15.112 --> 00:19:16.780
The Western Ridge is unpassable.

376
00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:19.741
It would take two weeks
to get out of the Elder Dragon's path.

377
00:19:20.325 --> 00:19:22.244
-What about the Guild?
-They're too far away.

378
00:19:22.327 --> 00:19:23.662
You said so yourself.

379
00:19:25.122 --> 00:19:26.748
Aiden. you've seen the danger.

380
00:19:26.832 --> 00:19:29.793
Convince your people to go west.
and you may still save some of them.

381
00:19:29.877 --> 00:19:32.921
Remain in the valley.
and you will lose everyone.

382
00:19:34.548 --> 00:19:36.425
Wait. where are you going?

383
00:19:36.508 --> 00:19:39.970
It is my mission to warn every village
from here to the ocean to evacuate.

384
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:41.638
Not just yours.

385
00:19:41.722 --> 00:19:43.098
So. that's it?

386
00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:44.933
You're just gonna walk away?

387
00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:46.351
Well. what if we fight it?

388
00:19:46.435 --> 00:19:50.314
What if we can somehow change its course
so it doesn't destroy all those villages?

389
00:19:50.397 --> 00:19:51.565
We're Hunters.

390
00:19:51.648 --> 00:19:53.108
We have to do something!

391
00:19:53.192 --> 00:19:55.569
An Elder Dragon
is not just another monster.

392
00:19:55.652 --> 00:19:57.487
And you are not a Hunter.

393
00:19:57.571 --> 00:20:00.449
Maybe not. Maybe I've been kidding myself.

394
00:20:00.532 --> 00:20:03.285
but at least I know
what it means to be a monster Hunter.

395
00:20:03.368 --> 00:20:06.038
I'm not gonna turn my back
on Elder Daazel. Burl.

396
00:20:06.121 --> 00:20:08.582
Genovan. Mitul. or Ebbi.

397
00:20:08.665 --> 00:20:10.584
I'll fight with sticks if I have to!

398
00:20:10.667 --> 00:20:11.960
[sighs] I bring him out here.

399
00:20:12.044 --> 00:20:14.838
and he becomes
even more determined to stay.

400
00:20:15.631 --> 00:20:18.425
"Care for nature.
and it will deliver prosperity."

401
00:20:18.967 --> 00:20:21.970
"Build from prosperity
to craft a thriving community."

402
00:20:22.054 --> 00:20:24.097
"Live harmoniously in that community

403
00:20:24.181 --> 00:20:26.683
and teach it to always care for nature."

404
00:20:27.434 --> 00:20:28.977
The cycle of balance?

405
00:20:29.061 --> 00:20:31.021
Isn't that what you swore to protect?

406
00:20:31.104 --> 00:20:34.900
That Elder Dragon is destroying nature.
and it's about to destroy community.

407
00:20:34.983 --> 00:20:36.693
If you leave.
you're not just abandoning us.

408
00:20:36.777 --> 00:20:39.696
You're turning your back on
what it means to be a Hunter.

409
00:20:40.489 --> 00:20:41.907
Where did you learn that?

410
00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:47.162
This journal belongs to a Hunter.

411
00:20:53.794 --> 00:20:54.836
[shot echoes]

412
00:20:55.671 --> 00:20:57.422
[bright orchestral music playing]

413
00:20:57.506 --> 00:20:59.841
Anyone within range will find us.

414
00:20:59.925 --> 00:21:03.345
If we're going to do this.
we're going to need some help.

415
00:21:03.428 --> 00:21:06.265
Yes! It is "Alatre-on"!

416
00:21:06.848 --> 00:21:09.059
[Julius]
The last entry here is only two days old.

417
00:21:09.142 --> 00:21:12.229
-Where did you get it?
-I found it in Nox's loot.

418
00:21:12.312 --> 00:21:15.440
-[branches snap]
-[Nox yelps. groans]

419
00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:17.567
Who did you steal this from?

420
00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:19.486
"Purr-cured" it. please.

421
00:21:19.569 --> 00:21:21.071
Easy on the s-word.

422
00:21:21.154 --> 00:21:24.199
Uh. the thing is. uh.
my memory's a little foggy. so…

423
00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:28.287
-Find the owner. and you go free.
-[clicks tongue] Right this way.

424
00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:29.705
[thunder crashes]

425
00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.084
[birds calling]

426
00:21:34.167 --> 00:21:37.004
[Nox] This is "purr-ty" close
to where I found the Hunter.

427
00:21:37.087 --> 00:21:38.964
She was camped here for the night.

428
00:21:40.507 --> 00:21:41.967
You guys smell that?

429
00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:44.136
This way. And careful.

430
00:21:44.219 --> 00:21:47.139
The creature
she's hunting is extremely dangerous.

431
00:21:47.222 --> 00:21:50.517
Buddy. if we run into trouble.
plan A is run away.

432
00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.811
Plans C. D. and E are hide.

433
00:21:52.894 --> 00:21:54.688
negotiate. and run away.

434
00:21:54.771 --> 00:21:56.732
There is no plan boomerang.

435
00:21:57.316 --> 00:21:59.609
-[screams]
-[grunts] Get out of the way!

436
00:22:00.736 --> 00:22:02.988
-[Julius grunts]
-[Nerscylla growls]

437
00:22:03.071 --> 00:22:04.072
[jaws clanging]

440
00:22:10.662 --> 00:22:13.123
-Hey. ugly! Over here.
-[Kinsect buzzes]

441
00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:17.669
[Hunter] Let's see what you got.

442
00:22:19.212 --> 00:22:20.589
[Nerscylla growls]

443
00:22:22.841 --> 00:22:24.259
[Hunter grunts]

444
00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:26.428
You're a lot faster than that last one.

445
00:22:26.511 --> 00:22:28.930
[yelps. grunts]

446
00:22:29.014 --> 00:22:30.307
This is high.

447
00:22:30.891 --> 00:22:33.894
[straining. grunts]

448
00:22:33.977 --> 00:22:35.896
Paisley!

449
00:22:35.979 --> 00:22:37.314
[grunting]

450
00:22:41.401 --> 00:22:42.569
[Aiden] Don't worry!

451
00:22:42.652 --> 00:22:45.197
We are here to he-- [groans]

452
00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.865
Ugh. Amateurs.

453
00:22:46.948 --> 00:22:49.117
[Aiden screaming]

454
00:22:49.201 --> 00:22:51.161
Ah! Oh! [grunts]

455
00:22:51.244 --> 00:22:53.205
-[Nox] They're not coming this way.
-[screams]

456
00:22:53.288 --> 00:22:55.374
[yelps] Oh! No. no. no. no!

457
00:22:55.457 --> 00:22:57.626
[in slow-motion] Oh no!

458
00:22:57.709 --> 00:22:59.294
Can't believe I'm doing this.

459
00:22:59.378 --> 00:23:00.212
[Aiden] Help!

460
00:23:00.337 --> 00:23:02.130
[grunts. screams]

461
00:23:02.214 --> 00:23:04.466
I got you. man. You're gonna be okay.

462
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:06.468
[Hunter grunts]

463
00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.638
-[Nox and Aiden screaming]
-[Hunter] Seriously?

464
00:23:09.721 --> 00:23:12.474
[Nox and Aiden yelp]

465
00:23:12.557 --> 00:23:14.059
-[Nox groans]
-[Aiden screams]

466
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:18.105
Okay. big guy.
Let's see how well you fight.

467
00:23:18.605 --> 00:23:22.192
-Ha! You are a nasty one. aren't ya?
-[Nerscylla growls]

468
00:23:22.275 --> 00:23:24.027
[Hunter yelps. grunts]

471
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.200
[grunting]

472
00:23:32.035 --> 00:23:33.870
[Nox] We'll be perfectly safe now.

473
00:23:33.954 --> 00:23:35.080
[yowls]

474
00:23:35.163 --> 00:23:36.998

[Julius grunts]

480
00:23:47.509 --> 00:23:51.471
-[Aiden] Hey! I'm still up here!
-Time for plan boomerang.

481
00:23:51.555 --> 00:23:53.140
No. no. no! No plan boomerang!

482
00:23:53.223 --> 00:23:55.016
Hyah!

483
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:56.101
[Aiden screams]

484
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:58.979
[Nox yelps. grunts]

485
00:23:59.062 --> 00:24:02.315
Sure. he gives me the weapon
that comes flying back at your face.

486
00:24:02.816 --> 00:24:04.985
[Julius grunts]

487
00:24:05.068 --> 00:24:07.154

-[Nerscylla growls]
-[Julius groans]

489
00:24:10.157 --> 00:24:11.867
Give him a big kiss for us.

[Hunter and Julius grunting]

494
00:24:26.673 --> 00:24:28.216
I'm back in this.

495
00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.760
I'm gonna flank him! [grunts]

496
00:24:31.428 --> 00:24:32.596
[Hunter yelps]

497
00:24:32.679 --> 00:24:34.389
I got a little problem here!

498
00:24:36.266 --> 00:24:41.188
[grunting] Julius. I think I'm stuck.
stuck in the gooey stuff.

499
00:24:41.271 --> 00:24:44.524
[groans] Hurry. hurry.
hurry. hurry. He's coming.

500
00:24:44.608 --> 00:24:46.776
He's gonna eat me. Hurry!

501
00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:47.777
Watch out!

502
00:24:47.861 --> 00:24:49.070
[Nerscylla growls]

503
00:24:49.154 --> 00:24:51.114
-[entrails splatter]
-[Aiden] Ugh!

504
00:24:51.198 --> 00:24:53.325
[groans] That…

505
00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:55.660
was so cool!

506
00:24:55.744 --> 00:24:57.537
That was so cool! Did you see?

507
00:24:57.621 --> 00:24:59.623
Guys.
I can't hold this little fella all day.

508
00:24:59.706 --> 00:25:02.459
Oh man. I was up in the tree.
and then I swung back. I…

509
00:25:02.542 --> 00:25:03.710
I got a few hits in. and then…

510
00:25:03.793 --> 00:25:06.796
Thanks a bunch. you guys.
I only needed another few minutes

511
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.216
to ascertain
its bite strength and leaping ability.

512
00:25:09.299 --> 00:25:12.636
And those swords.
they're gonna throw the data way off.

513
00:25:12.719 --> 00:25:15.472
-[Julius] You slayed it.
-Your partner was in big trouble.

514
00:25:15.555 --> 00:25:17.307
And he's lucky this was a juvenile.

515
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:20.310
I would expect an Ace Hunter to recognize
when someone doesn't need help.

516
00:25:20.393 --> 00:25:21.353
Ace Hunter?

517
00:25:21.436 --> 00:25:23.480
-[Julius grunts]
-Yeah. him.

518
00:25:23.563 --> 00:25:25.398
-You. not so much.
-Hey.

519
00:25:25.482 --> 00:25:27.317
Nice work. geniuses. [sighs]

520
00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:29.486
Of course. nobody else takes the time to…

521
00:25:29.569 --> 00:25:31.780
[grunts] …obtain proper monster data.

522
00:25:31.863 --> 00:25:34.032
Just leave it to Mae
to do all the legwork.

523
00:25:34.115 --> 00:25:36.535
then mess it up
when she's almost done. [sighs]

524
00:25:36.618 --> 00:25:39.996
Here I was. thinking I was the only one
following up on these reports.

525
00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.207
No? Uh. why are you even here then?

526
00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:45.210
-You're Mae. I'm guessing.
-Oh! My journal. Oh! My notes.

527
00:25:45.293 --> 00:25:46.628
Oh! [kisses] Oh my gosh.

528
00:25:46.711 --> 00:25:48.838
-I thought I'd lost you.
-[chuckles] We found it.

529
00:25:48.922 --> 00:25:51.299
Uh. I mean.
well. we found Nox. and he sto--

530
00:25:51.383 --> 00:25:54.052
Hey. so. uh.
should we be concerned about that?

531
00:25:54.135 --> 00:25:55.762
[man screaming. muffled]

532
00:25:55.845 --> 00:25:57.264
-I'm up here!
-[shot rings out]

533
00:25:57.347 --> 00:25:58.348
-[man groans]
-[Mae] Whoa.

534
00:25:58.431 --> 00:25:59.766
[man grunting]

535
00:26:01.184 --> 00:26:03.895
Took me a while to pick up your trail
after I saw the flare.

536
00:26:03.979 --> 00:26:05.564
Sorry I missed the party.

537
00:26:06.106 --> 00:26:07.816
-Nadia.
-Julius.

538
00:26:08.441 --> 00:26:10.485
Two Ace Hunters.

539
00:26:10.569 --> 00:26:13.405
-Today must be my lucky day or something.
-You two know each other?

540
00:26:13.488 --> 00:26:15.824
They assigned me the region
just south of here.

541
00:26:15.907 --> 00:26:18.076
I spotted the smoke on the horizon.

542
00:26:18.159 --> 00:26:20.370
It's headed right into this valley.

543
00:26:20.453 --> 00:26:23.540
It's a Lunastra. a big one.

544
00:26:23.623 --> 00:26:25.500
-You've seen it?
-Lunastra?

545
00:26:25.584 --> 00:26:28.837
-As in. an Elder Dragon Lunastra?
-[Julius groans] Uh… Ah…

546
00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.381
And you got close to it?
What kind of a wingspan did it have?

547
00:26:31.464 --> 00:26:33.675
Was its mane more cobalt blue
or closer to periwinkle?

548
00:26:33.758 --> 00:26:34.634
[Nadia] Why the flare?

549
00:26:34.718 --> 00:26:38.179
Seems like you guys
had this one under control. Wait.

550
00:26:38.263 --> 00:26:40.807
No. You're actually going to fight it?

551
00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:43.643
-We could use your help.
-Are you kidding?

552
00:26:43.727 --> 00:26:46.646
No one's done a comprehensive assessment
of a Lunastra before.

553
00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:48.189
You know what we're asking.

554
00:26:48.273 --> 00:26:51.610
[chuckles] If that time
with the Ludroth is any indication.

555
00:26:51.693 --> 00:26:53.737
you do a lot better
with me watching your back.

556
00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:55.196
"Gargw-awesome."

557
00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.115
-What the--?
-Uh. he does that.

558
00:26:57.949 --> 00:27:00.744
Hey. uh. I… I don't think
that guy can breathe in there.

559
00:27:00.827 --> 00:27:02.454
-[binding rips]
-[man panting]

560
00:27:02.537 --> 00:27:04.205
Where… Where is that thing?

561
00:27:04.289 --> 00:27:05.415
Did… Did you kill it?

562
00:27:06.249 --> 00:27:08.960
Oh. thank you. You saved my life.

563
00:27:09.044 --> 00:27:11.755
That thing destroyed my whole caravan.

564
00:27:12.547 --> 00:27:14.966
You really want
to take on an Elder Dragon.

565
00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:17.719
we're gonna need
a lot more than armor repairs.

566
00:27:17.802 --> 00:27:19.429
We're gonna need weapons.

567
00:27:19.512 --> 00:27:20.680
Big weapons.

568
00:27:20.764 --> 00:27:25.393
Uh. actually. I was trading
with a smithy not far from here.

569
00:27:25.477 --> 00:27:26.770
Name of Ravi.

570
00:27:26.853 --> 00:27:28.605
I can show you where to find him.

571
00:27:28.688 --> 00:27:32.567
but I should warn you.
he is not very fond of visitors.

572
00:27:32.651 --> 00:27:34.527
-[tools clanging]
-[Nox laughs] What? Oh yeah.

573
00:27:34.611 --> 00:27:37.072
I'm sure
this guy gets lots of customers every day.

574
00:27:37.155 --> 00:27:37.989
Yeah.

575
00:27:39.199 --> 00:27:41.910
-[bright orchestral music playing]
-Uh. excuse me.

576
00:27:41.993 --> 00:27:45.080
Whatever your business. take it elsewhere.

577
00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:48.083
Uh. please.
There's an Elder Dragon coming.

578
00:27:48.583 --> 00:27:50.794
-We're trying to stop it.
-[steam hisses]

579
00:27:50.877 --> 00:27:51.795
We need some…

580
00:27:52.337 --> 00:27:55.256
If you'd just forge some equipment for us.
it can make a big difference.

581
00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.133
I don't forge weapons.

582
00:27:58.593 --> 00:27:59.636
You'll die too!

583
00:27:59.719 --> 00:28:02.347
This Elder Dragon
you're so eager to confront.

584
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:03.848
its life can't be measured

585
00:28:03.932 --> 00:28:05.392
by human understanding.

586
00:28:05.475 --> 00:28:06.893
It has existed for ages

587
00:28:06.976 --> 00:28:10.146
and will continue to exist
long after we're gone.

588
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:13.983
Compared to that.
our lives are small. meaningless things.

589
00:28:14.693 --> 00:28:17.946
Maybe your life
has been meaningless. but mine won't be.

590
00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:19.447
Aiden. go.

591
00:28:20.657 --> 00:28:22.283
[Ravi] You. Hunter.

592
00:28:23.284 --> 00:28:26.162
Did you forget
how dangerous an Elder Dragon is?

593
00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:30.500
You're walking to your own death.
and you're taking this boy with you.

594
00:28:31.418 --> 00:28:34.087
He's not doing it for himself.
and neither are we.

595
00:28:34.587 --> 00:28:37.298
Or did you forget
what it means to be a Hunter?

596
00:28:37.882 --> 00:28:39.718
You were one. weren't you?

597
00:28:39.801 --> 00:28:42.679
Not… for a long time.

598
00:28:42.762 --> 00:28:44.764
[theme music playing]

599
00:28:47.058 --> 00:28:49.352
[Gargwa clucking]

600
00:28:49.436 --> 00:28:51.730
Oh. What's this?

601
00:28:51.813 --> 00:28:55.316
There's been a change of plans. everyone.
We're not leaving.

602
00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.111
We're gonna stay and defend our homes.

603
00:28:58.194 --> 00:29:00.697
-And I've brought us some help.
-Wait. what?

604
00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:01.906
[villagers clamoring]

605
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:05.160
[Julius] There's a natural pinch point
just outside the village.

606
00:29:05.243 --> 00:29:08.872
If we can guide it right into that spot.
we can set a trap for it.

607
00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:11.624
[villagers grunting]

608
00:29:12.751 --> 00:29:15.378
It's a one-of-a-kind Nerscylla stinger.

609
00:29:15.462 --> 00:29:16.838
All kinds of uses.

610
00:29:16.921 --> 00:29:19.299
-Sewing. walking stick-- Ow!
-[stinger pierces]

611
00:29:19.382 --> 00:29:20.467
…tranquilizer.

612
00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:21.968
Oh…

613
00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:28.516
[bird cries in distance]

614
00:29:29.017 --> 00:29:31.686
-[Ebbi] And this?
-I scouted as far as I could get.

615
00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:33.855
-[Mae] She's a tough one.
-Tracks all over.

616
00:29:33.938 --> 00:29:35.482
Everything for 100 miles

617
00:29:35.565 --> 00:29:37.942
has been stirred up
by the Lunastra's migration.

618
00:29:38.026 --> 00:29:39.903
It may work to our advantage.

619
00:29:39.986 --> 00:29:43.782
There are some things we need
that we can only get from monsters.

620
00:29:49.746 --> 00:29:51.831
[Aiden grunts]

621
00:29:53.416 --> 00:29:54.584
Ah.

00:30:01.174 --> 00:30:02.884
Uh… [grunts]

624
00:30:02.967 --> 00:30:03.843
Oh brother.

-[monster growls]
-[Nadia] Here it comes!

626
00:30:06.971 --> 00:30:10.016
-[yelps] Where are you guys?
-[Aiden] Nox! Nox! Nox!

627
00:30:10.099 --> 00:30:11.893
What are you doin' over there?

628
00:30:11.976 --> 00:30:13.394
[Nox screaming]

629
00:30:13.478 --> 00:30:14.729
Nadia. now.

630
00:30:17.023 --> 00:30:18.024
[Aiden] This way! Hurry!

631
00:30:18.107 --> 00:30:19.734
[Nox grunts. yelps]

632
00:30:19.818 --> 00:30:21.110
[Aiden] No. Nox!

633
00:30:21.194 --> 00:30:23.154
-Gotcha. buddy.
-[Congalala groans]

634
00:30:23.238 --> 00:30:24.155
Nice shot.

635
00:30:24.739 --> 00:30:25.782
Mae. we're up.

[Aiden] All right!

649
00:31:02.944 --> 00:31:04.612
[grunts] Aha!

-Whoa!
-Yellow Mushrooms cause paralysis.

653
00:31:13.079 --> 00:31:13.913
Set the trap.

654
00:31:13.997 --> 00:31:14.831
[Aiden] Okay.

655
00:31:14.914 --> 00:31:16.624

Yes!

659
00:31:26.634 --> 00:31:28.177
[grunts] All right!

660
00:31:28.261 --> 00:31:30.221
[Nadia sighs] Just like you drew it up.

661
00:31:31.014 --> 00:31:34.309
[panting] Well done. everyone.
That's what teamwork looks like.

662
00:31:34.392 --> 00:31:36.436
Nice deployment on that trap. Aiden.

663
00:31:36.519 --> 00:31:39.314
Thanks. I didn't even need
those extra anchors you gave me.

664
00:31:39.397 --> 00:31:41.733
-You didn't anchor it?
-[groans] Come on.

No! We can't just let him get away.

671
00:31:53.578 --> 00:31:55.663

-Nox. get that Yellow Mushroom!
-What?

675
00:32:05.131 --> 00:32:07.133
Are you crazy?

676
00:32:07.216 --> 00:32:09.594
[Aiden]
We can use it to paralyze the Congalala.

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.475

Hey. that's got a Dragon Element.

724
00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:09.881

for the Dragonator.

[Nox] Uh…

740
00:34:45.458 --> 00:34:47.752
Mae. we can use the mushroom
to paralyze the Jho.

741
00:34:47.835 --> 00:34:48.669
Got it.

-[heroic orchestral music playing]

765

Everyone all right?

766
00:35:53.067 --> 00:35:56.946
Whoo! Did you see that?
Did you see what we just did?

767
00:35:57.029 --> 00:35:58.156
Are you kidding me?

768
00:35:58.239 --> 00:35:59.991
I pulled off
that sweet block you showed me.

769
00:36:00.074 --> 00:36:02.493
Your recklessness
almost got us all killed.

770
00:36:02.577 --> 00:36:04.453
We would've been safe
when that Deviljho appeared

771
00:36:04.537 --> 00:36:06.372
if you had just listened to me.

772
00:36:06.455 --> 00:36:09.167
When I command you to retreat. you do so.

773
00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:10.668
No hesitation!

774
00:36:10.751 --> 00:36:12.211
I was wrong about you.

775
00:36:13.171 --> 00:36:15.006
For all of your talk
of protecting your village.

776
00:36:15.089 --> 00:36:17.842
the only thing that you care about
is getting your pat on the back.

777
00:36:17.925 --> 00:36:19.552
[Nadia] Don't you think you're being a--

778
00:36:19.635 --> 00:36:21.971
No. Nadia. I know what I'm seeing.

779
00:36:22.054 --> 00:36:26.601
This is not a team that I can lead.
This was always a fool's errand anyway.

780
00:36:27.101 --> 00:36:28.603
Tell everyone to pack up.

781
00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:36.235
[flies buzzing]

782
00:36:36.319 --> 00:36:39.614
Do you think being slightly chewed
is gonna hurt the market value?

783
00:36:41.282 --> 00:36:45.119
[Aiden] I really thought I was improving.
Now look at things.

784
00:36:45.203 --> 00:36:47.538
Hey. it's not your fault.

785
00:36:47.622 --> 00:36:50.833
No. I messed up again.

786
00:36:50.917 --> 00:36:53.669
just like getting myself cornered
by that Velocidrome.

787
00:36:53.753 --> 00:36:55.922
[Mae] And ruining my Nerscylla research.

788
00:36:56.005 --> 00:36:57.882
And blowing the Congalala trap.

789
00:36:57.965 --> 00:36:59.425
Oh. and don't forget.

790
00:36:59.508 --> 00:37:02.470
almost getting us trampled.
fried. and devoured by a Deviljho.

791
00:37:02.553 --> 00:37:03.387
No big deal.

792
00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:06.098
I'm startin' to think
I'm not cut out to be a Hunter.

793
00:37:06.182 --> 00:37:08.476
[chuckles] Oh!
And following the fake tracks I made.

794
00:37:08.559 --> 00:37:10.144
Yeah. don't forget that one.

795
00:37:10.228 --> 00:37:12.021
Yeah. I'm sorry for that day.

796
00:37:12.605 --> 00:37:14.607
For trying to hit you
with a hammer. I mean.

797
00:37:15.149 --> 00:37:16.317
I'm glad I missed.

798
00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.612
[Nox] So am I. kid. So am I.

799
00:37:19.695 --> 00:37:21.572
[villagers clamoring]

800
00:37:21.656 --> 00:37:23.574
-[Burl] Oh. Aiden!
-[man 1] It's Aiden!

801
00:37:23.658 --> 00:37:25.910
-[Burl] Everyone all right?
-[Nox] Thank you. thank you.

802
00:37:25.993 --> 00:37:27.703
Heroes. coming through.

803
00:37:27.787 --> 00:37:29.664
-The heroes have returned.
-[man 2] Hey. Aiden!

804
00:37:29.747 --> 00:37:32.250
[Nox] Thank you. thank you. thank you.

805
00:37:32.333 --> 00:37:33.751
Boy. are we hungry.

806
00:37:33.834 --> 00:37:36.504
-[birds singing]
-[villagers continue chattering]

807
00:37:36.587 --> 00:37:38.589
[gentle orchestral music playing]

808
00:37:41.467 --> 00:37:43.302
Do you remember our first hunt?

809
00:37:43.928 --> 00:37:45.388
Gypceros. wasn't it?

810
00:37:45.471 --> 00:37:47.765
It was the first time
you hunted with a Gunner.

811
00:37:47.848 --> 00:37:49.934
You spent half the fight
looking over your shoulder.

812
00:37:50.017 --> 00:37:52.061
trying to make sure
you weren't in the way.

813
00:37:52.144 --> 00:37:54.855
So. when the thing flashed its crystal
to blind us--

814
00:37:54.939 --> 00:37:56.691
Ah. I saw spots for weeks.

815
00:37:57.191 --> 00:38:01.487
[chuckles] Not exactly the smoothest start
for Master Kambei's prodigal student.

816
00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:03.656
Why did you follow me. Nadia?

817
00:38:03.739 --> 00:38:05.950
Aiden made a mistake. He's young.

818
00:38:06.033 --> 00:38:07.910
His impulsiveness is a problem.

819
00:38:07.994 --> 00:38:12.331
Says the guy who once charged
into a Rajang's mating grounds unarmed.

820
00:38:12.415 --> 00:38:14.292
That's exactly what worries me.

821
00:38:15.042 --> 00:38:17.336
Says the guy who risked his friend…

822
00:38:18.004 --> 00:38:19.297
his mentor's life.

823
00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:21.090
That was not your fault.

824
00:38:21.632 --> 00:38:24.260
We had enough on our hands
with the Rathian.

825
00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:27.471
Having a Kushala Daora
appear right in the middle of it

826
00:38:27.555 --> 00:38:29.682
was a one-in-a-million chance.

827
00:38:29.765 --> 00:38:31.559
Nah. it wasn't that.

828
00:38:31.642 --> 00:38:35.730
I made mistakes.
The master had to come in and save me.

829
00:38:36.647 --> 00:38:38.691
We were fighting an Elder Dragon.

830
00:38:39.483 --> 00:38:41.527
I did it to impress the master.

831
00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:44.196
[scoffs] It wasn't easy training with you.

832
00:38:45.072 --> 00:38:47.116
You were Master Kambei's favorite.

833
00:38:48.075 --> 00:38:50.953
He saw something important in you.

834
00:38:51.454 --> 00:38:53.497
I saw it too. with the Deviljho.

835
00:38:54.373 --> 00:38:56.250
We can't do this without you.

836
00:38:56.334 --> 00:38:59.587
-I'm not that person anymore.
-[Nadia] You are.

837
00:39:00.755 --> 00:39:02.340
That's why I followed you.

838
00:39:03.758 --> 00:39:05.760
[river flowing]

839
00:39:12.475 --> 00:39:13.768
Take my weapons.

840
00:39:13.851 --> 00:39:17.188
Just. please stay and lead the others.

841
00:39:17.271 --> 00:39:18.272
Protect Timben.

842
00:39:18.981 --> 00:39:20.691
I acted like a fool.

843
00:39:20.775 --> 00:39:23.652
The people here counted on me.
and I let them down.

844
00:39:24.445 --> 00:39:26.989
I know you won't lead a team
with me on it.

845
00:39:28.366 --> 00:39:29.867
We will protect Timben…

846
00:39:30.826 --> 00:39:31.702
together.

847
00:39:32.203 --> 00:39:33.037
[Ravi] Hunters!

848
00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:36.248
You said you needed a smith?

849
00:39:37.458 --> 00:39:40.461
-[upbeat orchestral music playing]
-[Ravi and Burl grunting]

850
00:39:45.383 --> 00:39:47.009
[Ravi] I built it to your design.

851
00:39:47.093 --> 00:39:49.678
Congalala stomach should work fine
for the steam housing.

852
00:39:49.762 --> 00:39:51.514
Deviljho bones for the bow.

853
00:39:51.597 --> 00:39:55.017
Never forged anything like this.
Can't promise it'll work.

854
00:39:55.101 --> 00:39:59.855
If you're all finished. the village
has prepared something special.

855
00:39:59.939 --> 00:40:01.399
You must eat.

856
00:40:02.108 --> 00:40:03.943
[Nox munching]

857
00:40:04.568 --> 00:40:05.403
What?

858
00:40:05.486 --> 00:40:08.572
-[villagers chattering]
-[calming instrumental music playing]

859
00:40:14.286 --> 00:40:16.789
To Timben's protectors.

860
00:40:16.872 --> 00:40:19.500
-Good hunting!
-[Nox] Enough. already. Let's eat.

861
00:40:25.172 --> 00:40:27.341
[Aiden]
That journal of yours is something.

862
00:40:27.842 --> 00:40:29.468
I think I learned more flipping through it

863
00:40:29.552 --> 00:40:31.720
than the rest
of my time trying to be a Hunter.

864
00:40:32.513 --> 00:40:36.976
When I was about Ebbi's age.
my parents made me write down everything.

865
00:40:37.059 --> 00:40:38.644
Needleberries. Flashbugs.

866
00:40:39.145 --> 00:40:42.440
They were researchers.
Sticklers for accurate notes.

867
00:40:42.523 --> 00:40:43.816
I hated it.

868
00:40:43.899 --> 00:40:45.693
So. I got my Guild license

869
00:40:45.776 --> 00:40:48.404
and accepted a quest
that would send me out into the world.

870
00:40:49.196 --> 00:40:50.948
Gone for two full years.

871
00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:52.658
Figures.

872
00:40:53.242 --> 00:40:57.872
I'm about to see an Elder Dragon.
and suddenly. I'd give just about anything

873
00:40:57.955 --> 00:41:01.459
to be back sketching bugs
and berries with them all over again.

874
00:41:02.084 --> 00:41:04.462
"Zamite" be something wrong with you.

875
00:41:04.545 --> 00:41:07.756
[chuckles] How come you always do that?

876
00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.467
Make puns out of monster names.

877
00:41:15.764 --> 00:41:18.601
The village I used to live in
was destroyed when I was seven.

878
00:41:18.684 --> 00:41:20.060
overrun by monsters.

879
00:41:20.144 --> 00:41:22.855
-[gentle music playing]
-I lost my parents.

880
00:41:22.938 --> 00:41:25.524
I spent a long time
after that being scared.

881
00:41:26.942 --> 00:41:27.776
Eventually…

882
00:41:28.944 --> 00:41:30.279
I just got tired of it.

883
00:41:30.988 --> 00:41:34.700
I figured. if I learned about monsters
and made jokes out of their names.

884
00:41:35.201 --> 00:41:36.744
they didn't seem as scary.

885
00:41:37.912 --> 00:41:41.540
Hmm. I'd say. "Veloci-diculous."

886
00:41:41.624 --> 00:41:44.835
[both laugh]

887
00:41:47.379 --> 00:41:49.673
When I was in Val Habar some years ago.

888
00:41:49.757 --> 00:41:52.051
I remember rumors of a rogue Hunter.

889
00:41:52.968 --> 00:41:55.930
They say he turned his back
on the Guild's philosophy.

890
00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:58.224
Started hunting for sport.

891
00:41:58.307 --> 00:42:01.185
taking trophies.
and selling weapons to fund his habit.

892
00:42:01.268 --> 00:42:02.311
You came to me.

893
00:42:02.937 --> 00:42:05.314
If you have something
you want to say to me. say it.

894
00:42:06.232 --> 00:42:08.526
A Hunter
can easily lose his way in battle.

895
00:42:08.609 --> 00:42:11.570
Especially alone. When we go out there--

896
00:42:11.654 --> 00:42:14.740
I don't need a sermon
from a Hunter willing to risk our lives

897
00:42:14.823 --> 00:42:16.867
to redeem himself from past mistakes.

898
00:42:18.994 --> 00:42:23.082
Past mistakes
have a remarkable way of taking us down.

899
00:42:23.707 --> 00:42:26.043
Well. maybe tomorrow will be a chance

900
00:42:26.126 --> 00:42:29.421
for all of us to exorcise
some very old monsters.

901
00:42:29.505 --> 00:42:32.007
-[woman] Watch out!
-[monster roars]

902
00:42:32.091 --> 00:42:33.634
[villagers screaming]

903
00:42:34.343 --> 00:42:35.511
-[Mae gasps]
-[Nadia] Move it.

904
00:42:36.178 --> 00:42:38.180
Come on. I'm not finished eating.

905
00:42:38.931 --> 00:42:41.600
-[Nadia] Everything's ready.
-Time to kick some Lun-as-tra.

906
00:42:41.684 --> 00:42:43.978
-Really?
-[laughs] I actually liked that one.

907
00:42:44.061 --> 00:42:45.479
Not the time.

908
00:42:45.563 --> 00:42:47.565
[fire crackles]

909
00:42:51.402 --> 00:42:53.571
[Lunastra growling]

910
00:42:53.654 --> 00:42:55.489
[dramatic orchestral music playing]

911
00:43:01.161 --> 00:43:02.204
Weapons out.

912
00:43:02.288 --> 00:43:04.415
Whoa. She's huge.

913
00:43:04.999 --> 00:43:07.543
-[Nadia] Cover your ears!
-[Lunastra roars]

914
00:43:07.626 --> 00:43:08.502
[Aiden yells]

915
00:43:08.586 --> 00:43:09.712
-[Nox] I'm out.
-Nadia.

916
00:43:09.795 --> 00:43:11.463
-See if you can draw it off.
-Got it.

917
00:43:12.548 --> 00:43:14.633
[Nadia] Over here. girl! This way!

918
00:43:17.678 --> 00:43:19.138
She's not going for it.

919
00:43:19.805 --> 00:43:22.933
[Nox] It's. uh. coming back this way!

920
00:43:23.017 --> 00:43:23.892
Nox. go.

921
00:43:24.393 --> 00:43:26.645
-[Lunastra growling]
-Hurry.

922
00:43:29.481 --> 00:43:30.608
[Nox] Hyah!

923
00:43:31.317 --> 00:43:33.152
[Lunastra snarls]

924
00:43:33.235 --> 00:43:36.030
Oh! That's a lot of rocks.
How did that not work?

925
00:43:36.113 --> 00:43:38.490
[Julius] It's not going to leave
the valley unless we make it.

926
00:43:38.574 --> 00:43:41.785
-[Aiden] And now it flies?
-It'll burn the village down from the air.

927
00:43:41.869 --> 00:43:43.412
-Ground it!
-[Nadia] Coming in!

928
00:43:44.204 --> 00:43:46.206
[Bowgun shots echoing]

929
00:43:49.209 --> 00:43:51.086
[Aiden] Oh no. no. no. no!

930
00:43:51.587 --> 00:43:52.630
[groans]

931
00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:54.381
No!

932
00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:56.550
My brand-new shield!

933
00:43:56.634 --> 00:43:58.552
-[screams]
-[Lunastra growling]

934
00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:04.058
[Aiden] Ah!

935
00:44:04.642 --> 00:44:07.853
-Come on!
-Look at this thing. It took me six hours.

936
00:44:07.936 --> 00:44:09.938
Forget about it! It was terrible anyway.

937
00:44:10.022 --> 00:44:12.399
-[Mae] Ooh!
-[Lunastra snarls]

938
00:44:13.025 --> 00:44:15.903
[Mae grunts]
You're a lot stronger than I imagined.

939
00:44:18.989 --> 00:44:21.950

940
00:44:22.868 --> 00:44:24.495

[Ravi groans]

943
00:44:29.875 --> 00:44:31.919
We're going to draw it into position.

944
00:44:32.002 --> 00:44:33.045
Aiden. showtime.

945
00:44:34.713 --> 00:44:36.215
[Aiden panting]

946
00:44:36.298 --> 00:44:39.802
Don't mess it up. Don't mess it up.
Don't mess it up. Don't mess it up.

947
00:44:39.885 --> 00:44:41.553
Don't mess it up. Don't mess it up.

950
00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:50.521
It's time for plan Dragonator!

951

[Julius grunts]

952

[Lunastra snarls]

953
00:44:54.775 --> 00:44:56.402
It knows!

954
00:44:56.485 --> 00:44:58.112
-The jig is up!
-Hit it!

955
00:44:58.779 --> 00:45:00.280

[Aiden yells]

958
00:45:09.206 --> 00:45:11.417
-[Ravi] It didn't work!
-The fire damaged it.

959
00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:14.002
[Julius]
Use the snare traps. Hold it in position.

960
00:45:15.963 --> 00:45:17.089
[ropes straining]

961
00:45:18.173 --> 00:45:19.717
[Lunastra growling]

962
00:45:22.469 --> 00:45:24.138
The firing mechanism is busted!

963
00:45:24.221 --> 00:45:26.765
[Mae] Stop the leak in the compressor.
let it pressurize.

964
00:45:26.849 --> 00:45:28.851
Then you'll have
to trigger the Dragonator manually.

965
00:45:28.934 --> 00:45:30.269
[Julius] See if you can fix it.

966
00:45:30.853 --> 00:45:31.937
[Mae] Hold on.

967
00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:33.147
We can't hold this all day.

968
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:35.607

We had one shot with the Dragonator.
What do we do now?

1013

There's nothing left to do but attack.

1014

Give it everything we've got.

-Aiden. what are you doing?

1021

I have a plan.

Julius. you have to trust me. I need time.

1023

You'll have it. What are you going to do?

1024

Restore balance.

Did Aiden just run away
with all of my ammunition?

1027
00:48:14.808 --> 00:48:17.519
Uh. yeah. He says he needs some time.

1028
00:48:17.603 --> 00:48:19.605
No problem. Ideas how to do that?

-[Aiden] Nox!

1030

Get everyone out of the village!

Julius. the villagers.

1035
00:48:36.622 --> 00:48:37.497

1093
00:51:30.754 --> 00:51:32.964

Your sacrifice will never be forgotten.

Because of you. the balance of nature

1106
00:52:25.058 --> 00:52:27.978
can be brought back to this village.

1107
00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:30.063
Thank you.

1108
00:52:32.691 --> 00:52:33.984
There is no blame.

1109
00:52:34.901 --> 00:52:36.153
It was their choice.

1110
00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:39.906
They followed you
into an unwinnable battle.

1111
00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:44.369
To treat it as anything less
would diminish what they gave. And why.

1112
00:52:44.452 --> 00:52:46.746
No. It wasn't me they followed.

1113
00:52:47.581 --> 00:52:51.918
They followed something larger.
a balance each of us hope to find.

1114
00:52:55.046 --> 00:52:58.508
-[Nox sniffles]
-Here. This is Mae's journal.

1115
00:52:59.176 --> 00:53:03.388
You keep it. It has instructions
to make that Rathalos antidote in it.

1116
00:53:03.471 --> 00:53:07.225
I made my own journal
to start my own path…

1117
00:53:08.768 --> 00:53:09.936
just like Mae.

1118
00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:20.405

with you here to protect it.

Dundorma.

1123
00:53:54.231 --> 00:53:56.566
The Guild will need to know
what happened here.

1124
00:53:57.817 --> 00:53:59.277
I want to come with you.

1125
00:54:00.654 --> 00:54:04.532
There's a bigger picture out there.
beyond me. beyond Timben.

1126
00:54:05.033 --> 00:54:07.827
You taught me that
the night we first saw the Lunastra.

1127
00:54:08.411 --> 00:54:10.205
There are bigger threats out there.

1128
00:54:10.288 --> 00:54:13.500
If I'm gonna face them.
I need to become an Ace Hunter.

1129
00:54:16.378 --> 00:54:17.212
[Julius] Hmm.

1130
00:54:19.005 --> 00:54:22.259
That's a good "hmm."
I've known him a long time.

1131
00:54:22.801 --> 00:54:25.720
And if I am translating correctly.
that means.

1132
00:54:25.804 --> 00:54:28.515
[imitating Julius] "Why. Aiden.
you've come such a long way."

1133
00:54:28.598 --> 00:54:31.434

to take you on as my cadet."

-[Aiden] That's "ama-Zinogre"!

[Julius groans]

1136
00:54:35.855 --> 00:54:38.525
[Aiden] Hey. some people like my puns.
Right. Nadia?

1137
00:54:39.192 --> 00:54:40.485
[Nadia] That one was bad.

1138
00:54:42.404 --> 00:54:44.406
[crew members chattering]

1139
00:54:46.533 --> 00:54:48.201
That was pretty fantastic.

1140
00:54:48.285 --> 00:54:51.079
Yeah. like that story
about you taking on the Zamtrios.

1141
00:54:51.162 --> 00:54:54.833
Hey. that really happened. okay?
I came under it. I swept. all right?

1142
00:54:54.916 --> 00:54:57.877
This wasn't one of those stories.

1143
00:54:58.378 --> 00:54:59.254
was it?

1144
00:55:01.548 --> 00:55:02.382

Wow. It's Mae's last entry to her parents.

1147
00:55:11.474 --> 00:55:14.311
[Mae]
I have enjoyed every moment of my journey.

1148
00:55:14.394 --> 00:55:17.230
Father and Mother.
you have taught me well.

1149
00:55:17.314 --> 00:55:20.608
I think I understand now
why this world needs a Guild

1150
00:55:20.692 --> 00:55:23.695
and people like you
to teach them how to live in harmony.

1151
00:55:24.195 --> 00:55:26.698
Tonight. I joined a team of Hunters.

1152
00:55:27.198 --> 00:55:30.452
The mission
we are going on is truly dangerous.

1153
00:55:30.535 --> 00:55:32.329
I fear it may be my last.

1154
00:55:32.412 --> 00:55:34.706
but interestingly. I'm not afraid.

1155
00:55:34.789 --> 00:55:39.085
For these Hunters I fight with
are intelligent. caring. courageous.

1156
00:55:39.169 --> 00:55:40.837
and they brighten my world.

1157
00:55:41.338 --> 00:55:43.548
My heart is filled with hope.
