SOBRIETY CHECKPOINT

5
00:02:09.875 --> 00:02:10.958
You okay?

6
00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:14.125
Sort of.

7
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.833
You can tell me.

8
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.458
ALARM

9
00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:51.958
Hey. Paula. be careful.
looks like something's there.

10
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.250
-All right. let's go.

11
00:02:58.333 --> 00:02:59.166
Simón.

12
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.333
Simón!

13
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:17.416
Hello.

14
00:03:21.458 --> 00:03:22.583
You okay?

15
00:03:37.791 --> 00:03:39.333
-No.

16
00:03:42.083 --> 00:03:43.791
-Wait. wait. wait!
-Hey. wait. hey!

17
00:03:43.875 --> 00:03:45.958
-Look out!

18
00:03:46.041 --> 00:03:48.833
Slow down! Stop! Stop!

19
00:03:48.916 --> 00:03:50.791
-Move. move. move!
-Stop. stop!

20
00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:56.083
-You hurt?
-No.

21
00:03:56.166 --> 00:03:58.625
-Are you all right?

22
00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:10.208
-I'll call an ambulance.
-There's no time.

23
00:04:17.666 --> 00:04:18.666
It's serious.

24
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.708
-I should've called an ambulance.
-Quite the contrary.

25
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:23.583
Your quick action saved her.

26
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.666
It looked like the motorcycle
didn't even hit her.

27
00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.250
That's not the problem.

28
00:04:28.875 --> 00:04:30.625
She was already very sick.

29
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.791
What's wrong with her?

30
00:04:32.875 --> 00:04:34.250
We're running tests.

31
00:04:34.833 --> 00:04:37.625
-And her parents?
-We're trying to find them.

32
00:04:37.708 --> 00:04:40.250
But there are
no missing girls in the area.

33
00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:42.791
When you found her. did she say anything?

34
00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:46.041
-Did she speak?

35
00:04:46.125 --> 00:04:47.875
-She didn't.
-No. nothing.

36
00:06:55.291 --> 00:06:58.291
If she's not talking.
how did you find out her name?

37
00:06:58.375 --> 00:07:00.291
One of the nurses is named Clara.

38
00:07:00.375 --> 00:07:03.125
and she reacted very strongly to the name.

39
00:07:03.208 --> 00:07:04.916
-Anything else?
-Nothing.

40
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.291
-How come?
-We're not sure.

41
00:07:07.375 --> 00:07:10.708
Mutism is very broad.
There are many things that can cause it.

42
00:07:10.791 --> 00:07:13.875
Well. how did she get so sick?
I mean. do you have any idea?

43
00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.791
There are lots of unanswered questions.

44
00:07:16.375 --> 00:07:18.041
The main thing is that the doctors

45
00:07:18.125 --> 00:07:21.041
are saying she's handling
the treatment extremely well.

46
00:07:21.125 --> 00:07:24.333
And soon we'll be able
to say she's a normal healthy girl.

47
00:07:28.791 --> 00:07:30.166
Hey. what's wrong?

48
00:07:32.083 --> 00:07:35.625
What happened?
Did something happen with one of the kids?

49
00:07:42.708 --> 00:07:44.041
Hey. hey!

50
00:07:49.041 --> 00:07:50.583
-Okay. okay. Calm down.

51
00:08:06.916 --> 00:08:10.208
Do you want us to stay?

52
00:08:14.875 --> 00:08:15.708
Clara?

53
00:08:16.708 --> 00:08:18.125
Is your name Clara?

54
00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:21.000
I'll stay with her here.

55
00:09:19.416 --> 00:09:20.916
How do they know her age?

56
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.500
They did an X-ray on one of her hands.

57
00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:27.041
-And her parents?
-They can't find them.

58
00:09:27.833 --> 00:09:30.541
-Did they say more?
-No.

59
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:34.250
They don't know much.
So they can't tell us much.

60
00:09:34.333 --> 00:09:36.750
Oh my God. that poor girl.

61
00:09:37.333 --> 00:09:38.958
It's awful.

62
00:09:40.125 --> 00:09:42.916
Was she abused at all?

63
00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:45.125
No.

64
00:09:46.125 --> 00:09:47.500
Is she staying at the hospital?

65
00:09:48.166 --> 00:09:50.166
Mm. She's very sick.

66
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:52.250
Her kidneys barely work.

67
00:09:52.333 --> 00:09:54.416
They don't know
if it's genetic or--

68
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:55.416
Terrible.

69
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.875
That's why
they need to find her parents.

70
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.375
They should cut their balls off.

71
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.916
-Leave it there.

72
00:10:39.875 --> 00:10:41.958
Excuse me.
Is she not feeling well?

73
00:10:42.041 --> 00:10:43.958
We have her sedated right now.

74
00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.333
Why is she tied up?

75
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.166
It's for safety.

76
00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.583
-Simón.

77
00:11:23.916 --> 00:11:25.208
Can't untie this girl.

78
00:11:26.333 --> 00:11:28.208
-Clara.
-I'm sorry.

79
00:11:30.416 --> 00:11:33.458
You can't be here. Excuse us.

80
00:11:40.791 --> 00:11:43.000
NO ONE CLAIMS GIRL FROM THE ROAD

81
00:11:43.083 --> 00:11:45.875
POLICE STILL INVESTIGATING
WHERE SHE CAME FROM TWO WEEKS LATER

82
00:11:54.916 --> 00:11:57.625
-Come on. I'm in a hurry.

83
00:12:01.916 --> 00:12:04.250
-Paula. I'll be late.

84
00:12:07.666 --> 00:12:08.875
I'm coming!

85
00:12:13.458 --> 00:12:15.458
Shall I pick you up to see Clara?

86
00:12:17.708 --> 00:12:18.541
Huh?

87
00:12:20.625 --> 00:12:22.208
Simón. should I get you?

88
00:12:24.875 --> 00:12:26.166
-Yes.

89
00:12:56.291 --> 00:12:58.291
-Weren't you in a hurry?

90
00:12:58.375 --> 00:12:59.416
Want some?

91
00:13:03.875 --> 00:13:04.750
Thank you.

92
00:13:12.583 --> 00:13:13.416
What?

93
00:13:15.041 --> 00:13:16.875
I can't stop thinking about her.

94
00:13:20.083 --> 00:13:22.250
Her kidneys
are finally responding.

95
00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:25.333
and thanks to you. she's improved a lot.

96
00:13:25.416 --> 00:13:27.500
And her parents? Any news?

97
00:13:28.208 --> 00:13:29.958
We can't find anything.

98
00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:34.500
Think of the chalk square like this table.

99
00:13:35.166 --> 00:13:37.166
Inside. everything is fine.

100
00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:38.916
But if we force her to come out…

101
00:13:41.625 --> 00:13:43.250
for Clara.
it's like falling into the void.

102
00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958
In the hospital. she's not doing well.

103
00:13:48.041 --> 00:13:50.833
In order to help her.
we need to establish some connection

104
00:13:50.916 --> 00:13:51.916
so she feels safe.

105
00:13:52.625 --> 00:13:56.083
It's a huge responsibility. but she has
started to form a bond with you.

106
00:13:56.166 --> 00:13:59.791
and we wanna take advantage
of that to help her find her family.

107
00:14:00.916 --> 00:14:03.875
This isn't like fostering.
It's more complicated than that.

108
00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:07.083
When parents foster. there's usually
a learning period. We don't have time.

109
00:14:07.666 --> 00:14:11.041
She is our priority. especially since
we don't know where she comes from.

110
00:14:11.125 --> 00:14:13.166
-And she doesn't have a home.
-We understand.

111
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:15.750
I've been completely honest with you.

112
00:14:15.833 --> 00:14:18.708
I've explained everything.
So it's up to you.

113
00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:21.958
Think it through and if you agree.
we'll start on the paperwork.

114
00:14:24.541 --> 00:14:27.583
Hey. uh. Paula.
did the doctors approve this?

115
00:14:27.666 --> 00:14:28.500
Yes.

116
00:14:29.541 --> 00:14:32.458
Well. I think that little girl
should be in a hospital.

117
00:14:32.541 --> 00:14:34.375
cared for by professionals.

118
00:14:34.458 --> 00:14:37.291
Yeah. but she's not doing well there.
and this was a good option.

119
00:14:37.375 --> 00:14:39.791
We'll see how it goes
for a few days and go from there.

120
00:14:39.875 --> 00:14:41.666
Have you thought this through?

121
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:43.875
Yes. we both discussed it.

122
00:14:46.208 --> 00:14:47.750
So it's decided. yeah?

123
00:14:48.666 --> 00:14:49.958
She'll get here tonight.

124
00:14:50.041 --> 00:14:52.500
Tonight? Well.
we should leave you to get set up. then.

125
00:15:55.458 --> 00:15:57.291
-Simón.

126
00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:00.208
-Simón.

127
00:16:08.375 --> 00:16:10.041
She saw the chalk square.

128
00:16:15.375 --> 00:16:17.208
-Good morning. Clara.

129
00:16:26.375 --> 00:16:27.208
Want some?

130
00:16:30.208 --> 00:16:32.916
-You want some?
-Yes.

131
00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.250
-Mmm!
-Is it good?

132
00:16:39.291 --> 00:16:40.541
Mmm! Really good.

133
00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:42.250
Mmm. Delicious.

134
00:16:54.875 --> 00:16:56.333
Yogurt is a good choice.

135
00:16:56.875 --> 00:16:58.791
-Mm. Yeah.
-It's always good.

136
00:20:54.875 --> 00:20:55.833
Good night.

137
00:21:24.333 --> 00:21:26.875
Clara. you wanna come with me?

138
00:21:48.916 --> 00:21:50.333
It's in all her drawings.

139
00:21:50.416 --> 00:21:52.750
She's probably
done it her whole life.

140
00:22:02.791 --> 00:22:05.083
Clara. will you come and play outside?

141
00:22:06.583 --> 00:22:07.541
You want to?

142
00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:13.041
Clara. I'll erase it.

143
00:22:14.458 --> 00:22:15.791
Gloria. don't.

144
00:22:15.875 --> 00:22:16.833
Wait in the kitchen.

145
00:22:17.375 --> 00:22:19.750
-Don't do that.
-We have to try it.

146
00:22:21.166 --> 00:22:22.000
Come on.

147
00:22:23.083 --> 00:22:24.916
Look at me. At me.

148
00:22:26.166 --> 00:22:29.291
I'll count to three.
and then we'll erase the chalk line.

149
00:22:30.291 --> 00:22:31.125
One.

150
00:22:32.458 --> 00:22:33.291
Two.

151
00:22:34.625 --> 00:22:37.000
-Don't be afraid.

152
00:22:37.083 --> 00:22:39.416
And… and three.

153
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:46.000
-Are you hurt?

154
00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:49.416
Come on. wait. Let her do her job.

155
00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:54.500
-Breathe.

156
00:22:55.208 --> 00:22:56.958
-Clara!

157
00:22:57.041 --> 00:23:00.958
-Buma! Buma!
-Stop it!

158
00:23:07.125 --> 00:23:08.458
Shh!

159
00:23:23.541 --> 00:23:26.416
Clara. I know you understand.

160
00:23:27.416 --> 00:23:29.083
I know you can speak.

161
00:23:30.458 --> 00:23:32.333
Earlier you said "buma."

162
00:23:37.875 --> 00:23:39.416
What is "buma"?

163
00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:46.583
No. I can't talk.

164
00:23:50.625 --> 00:23:52.791
No. I can't talk.

165
00:23:54.791 --> 00:23:55.708
Please.

166
00:23:57.166 --> 00:24:00.416
-What is that? I can't hear you.

167
00:24:06.333 --> 00:24:07.833
Where is your house?

168
00:24:08.916 --> 00:24:10.750
House. Kreide.

169
00:24:10.833 --> 00:24:13.208
"Kreide?" What is "kreide"?

170
00:24:14.541 --> 00:24:16.458
-Kreide.
-Kreide.

171
00:24:17.041 --> 00:24:19.375
Where's your home? Is it near here?

172
00:24:19.458 --> 00:24:20.666
Is it far away?

173
00:24:25.333 --> 00:24:26.791
Who do you live with?

174
00:24:30.083 --> 00:24:31.083
Mama.

175
00:24:31.791 --> 00:24:33.666
You live with your mama.

176
00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:34.708
Mama.

177
00:24:34.791 --> 00:24:37.708
Anyone else? Do you live with your papa?

178
00:24:40.041 --> 00:24:41.916
Clara. who do you live with?

179
00:24:43.333 --> 00:24:47.208
If you don't wanna talk to me.
I'll have to erase the chalk.

180
00:24:47.916 --> 00:24:49.833
-Clara!

181
00:25:10.125 --> 00:25:10.958
Hello.

182
00:25:15.333 --> 00:25:17.291
I won't force you to speak to me.

183
00:25:18.375 --> 00:25:20.500
I know you're afraid
of crossing the chalk.

184
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000
but…

185
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.958
you don't have to force yourself.

186
00:25:26.791 --> 00:25:28.750
Clara. while you're living here.

187
00:25:28.833 --> 00:25:31.666
Simón and I will make sure
nothing bad happens to you.

188
00:25:33.291 --> 00:25:34.291
I promise.

189
00:25:37.166 --> 00:25:38.666
We'll stay here.

190
00:26:03.125 --> 00:26:03.958
Is it for me?

191
00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:14.625
It's beautiful.

192
00:26:19.708 --> 00:26:21.000
I love your gift.

193
00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:25.541
-Hey. you brought lots of things--
-Don't step on the chalk line.

194
00:26:25.625 --> 00:26:27.500
We thought she couldn't talk.

195
00:26:27.583 --> 00:26:30.333
-Yeah. we thought that too.
-It's been a surprise to everyone.

196
00:26:30.416 --> 00:26:31.583
What does she say?

197
00:26:31.666 --> 00:26:34.125
It's random words.
Nothing understandable.

198
00:26:34.208 --> 00:26:36.333
The psychologist thinks
she'll start talking a little.

199
00:26:36.416 --> 00:26:39.000
She said "mama."
She probably lived with her.

200
00:26:39.083 --> 00:26:41.416
-And her dad?
-Nothing about him.

201
00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:42.708
You gonna teach her to speak?

202
00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:46.208
We're wondering if it's just
a matter of her gaining confidence.

203
00:26:46.291 --> 00:26:47.125
You need a glass.

204
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.083
-Oh. yes.
-No. no. no. I'll go. I'll go.

205
00:26:52.083 --> 00:26:53.041
Thank you.

206
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.875
Sorry. I don't know what I'm doing.

207
00:26:56.958 --> 00:26:58.583
It does sound like you're making progress.

208
00:26:59.333 --> 00:27:00.916
-Hmm.
-Thanks to Paula.

209
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:01.833
The girl adores her.

210
00:27:01.916 --> 00:27:04.500
Ainhoa is dying to meet Clara.

211
00:27:04.583 --> 00:27:05.416
Yeah?

212
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.458
It might be good for her.
To play with some other kids.

213
00:27:08.541 --> 00:27:11.916
We can come over tomorrow morning
and have breakfast together.

214
00:27:12.916 --> 00:27:13.750
Okay.

215
00:27:28.666 --> 00:27:31.125
That might've been
a little too intense. honey.

216
00:27:31.625 --> 00:27:33.000
Go on. go play with her.

217
00:27:36.208 --> 00:27:38.250
It's good we came over before her game.

218
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.958
-I can't believe how big she is.
-Neither can I.

219
00:27:49.625 --> 00:27:50.791
You're looking better.

220
00:27:55.625 --> 00:27:57.083
I'm happy for you. Paula.

221
00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:01.166
-Do you want some more toast?
-No. I think I might explode.

222
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:06.875
Girls!

223
00:28:07.875 --> 00:28:09.125
Come have breakfast.

224
00:28:12.416 --> 00:28:13.375
Girls.

225
00:28:20.125 --> 00:28:21.125
What's wrong?

226
00:28:56.833 --> 00:28:57.791
How is she?

227
00:28:57.875 --> 00:29:00.208
Fine. I just helped her back home.

228
00:29:00.291 --> 00:29:01.250
Come here.

229
00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:08.166
Look at what I found.

230
00:29:12.291 --> 00:29:13.666
These were in the jam.

231
00:29:14.791 --> 00:29:16.750
Plus the one Claudia had in her mouth.

232
00:29:17.416 --> 00:29:18.458
Look at the jar there.

233
00:29:22.416 --> 00:29:25.416
-But it looks normal.
-Exactly.

234
00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.875
-Simón--
-Someone put the glass in it.

235
00:29:28.458 --> 00:29:29.375
Oh. yeah?

236
00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:40.125
No.

237
00:29:40.208 --> 00:29:43.125
Do you not understand
what's going on here?

238
00:29:43.208 --> 00:29:45.708
That there was a piece
of broken glass in the jar?

239
00:29:47.333 --> 00:29:48.166
Come on.

240
00:29:52.666 --> 00:29:54.500
Should we call Gloria
and tell her about this?

241
00:29:54.583 --> 00:29:56.500
Mm. no. we can tell her tomorrow.

242
00:30:00.291 --> 00:30:01.416
What a mess.

243
00:30:06.625 --> 00:30:07.750
I'll be back.

244
00:30:11.916 --> 00:30:13.750
Remember to buy some more chalk for us.

245
00:31:06.375 --> 00:31:07.291
What's wrong?

246
00:31:10.708 --> 00:31:11.541
Look.

247
00:31:14.833 --> 00:31:17.083
"Kreide?"
What is "kreide"?

248
00:31:18.875 --> 00:31:21.125
-Please.
-Shh.

249
00:31:21.208 --> 00:31:24.291
-What is that? I can't hear you

250
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:26.583
Please.

251
00:31:26.666 --> 00:31:28.583
-Shh.

252
00:31:28.666 --> 00:31:29.500
SPANISH - GERMAN

253
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:33.958
BESTRAFEN

254
00:31:34.541 --> 00:31:35.708
PUNISHMENT

255
00:31:44.833 --> 00:31:48.083
Where's your home?
Is it near here? Is it far away?

256
00:31:54.666 --> 00:31:56.000
FEAR

257
00:31:57.291 --> 00:31:58.416
And "buma"?

258
00:32:08.625 --> 00:32:09.458
BUMA

259
00:32:09.541 --> 00:32:11.250
I'm going to tell the police.

260
00:32:11.333 --> 00:32:14.125
If Clara is German. I'm sure
they can help them find her parents.

261
00:32:14.208 --> 00:32:15.875
I'll call you as soon as I know something.

262
00:32:15.958 --> 00:32:17.041
Thank you.

263
00:32:26.083 --> 00:32:28.041
Why don't you wanna
tell her about the glass?

264
00:32:28.625 --> 00:32:30.250
I don't want her to misinterpret it.

265
00:32:31.333 --> 00:32:32.875
-'Cause I did?

266
00:32:53.833 --> 00:32:55.000
In my hand.

267
00:33:02.791 --> 00:33:04.541
So you speak German.

268
00:33:05.625 --> 00:33:08.291
Is your mama German? Or your papa?

269
00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:13.416
Have you lived in Germany?

270
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.041
Hey. come on. talk to me. please.

271
00:33:23.125 --> 00:33:24.250
I'll be right back.

272
00:34:13.083 --> 00:34:13.916
Clara.

273
00:34:41.125 --> 00:34:42.083
Clara?

274
00:34:56.375 --> 00:34:57.208
Clara?

275
00:35:14.625 --> 00:35:15.458
Clara.

276
00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:14.125
María! Did you see a girl
come out of my house?

277
00:36:14.208 --> 00:36:16.625
Blonde. about six years old? You seen her?

278
00:36:16.708 --> 00:36:17.916
Don't worry…

279
00:36:26.208 --> 00:36:28.583
-What are you doing? Drawing?

280
00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:32.041
Do you want some water or juice?

281
00:36:48.208 --> 00:36:49.041
What's wrong?

282
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:52.708
Hey. the washing machine broke.

283
00:37:01.583 --> 00:37:03.000
Everything's fine!

284
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:32.333
Hey.

285
00:37:45.291 --> 00:37:46.541
Were you hiding from me?

286
00:37:47.041 --> 00:37:47.875
Hmm?

287
00:37:51.916 --> 00:37:53.541
What are you afraid of?

288
00:37:58.208 --> 00:37:59.041
Is it "buma"?

289
00:38:03.875 --> 00:38:04.958
Is it something?

290
00:38:07.458 --> 00:38:09.291
Is-- Is it a person?

291
00:38:15.791 --> 00:38:17.041
Talk to me. Clara.

292
00:38:19.875 --> 00:38:20.875
Is it a place?

293
00:38:29.541 --> 00:38:30.791
What if we drew it?

294
00:38:34.875 --> 00:38:37.666
Let's draw it together. Here you go.

295
00:38:43.125 --> 00:38:43.958
Okay.

296
00:38:44.833 --> 00:38:46.500
We won't. It's okay.

297
00:38:48.125 --> 00:38:49.541
Can you please talk to me?

298
00:38:54.166 --> 00:38:55.000
Clara.

299
00:38:56.333 --> 00:38:59.583
Clara. what do you prefer.
talking or erasing the chalk?

300
00:38:59.666 --> 00:39:01.541
You know how to both of those things.

301
00:39:03.333 --> 00:39:05.625
-I'll do it.

302
00:39:06.541 --> 00:39:09.291
-Hey!

303
00:39:09.375 --> 00:39:10.458
Listen to me. hey!

304
00:39:11.791 --> 00:39:13.416
Clara. I won't erase it!

305
00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:15.416
-I'm sorry.

306
00:39:42.875 --> 00:39:44.291
Did Clara hit you?

307
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.083
-No.
-She didn't attack you?

308
00:39:49.166 --> 00:39:53.291
Well. I tried to force her to talk to me.
but I couldn't.

309
00:39:54.208 --> 00:39:58.083
And the glass? A pregnant
woman ended up in the hospital.

310
00:39:58.166 --> 00:40:00.000
We were gonna tell you tomorrow.

311
00:40:01.083 --> 00:40:03.000
Yes. it was a real shock.

312
00:40:04.375 --> 00:40:08.541
She understands when I speak German.
but she won't say anything.

313
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.166
Clara. why won't you talk anymore?

314
00:40:14.083 --> 00:40:17.333
Has something made you angry?
Or maybe you're sad?

315
00:40:17.833 --> 00:40:20.083
She's done
this lovely drawing.

316
00:40:21.833 --> 00:40:22.708
Can I see it?

317
00:40:24.625 --> 00:40:26.833
I think
she drew it for Paula.

318
00:40:27.458 --> 00:40:28.708
Can I take a look?

319
00:40:32.041 --> 00:40:33.541
Is that your house?

320
00:40:34.333 --> 00:40:36.583
That's grass. Do you live in the country?

321
00:40:39.208 --> 00:40:40.958
That's the sky. isn't it?

322
00:40:42.541 --> 00:40:43.583
Why is it green?

323
00:40:44.541 --> 00:40:45.375
Hmm?

324
00:40:53.958 --> 00:40:55.666
I don't know. honey. why don't you--

325
00:41:03.125 --> 00:41:06.416
-We'll talk in a couple of days.
-We're doing fine. really.

326
00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:08.208
She's starting to trust me.

327
00:41:08.291 --> 00:41:10.083
This isn't working out. I'm sorry.

328
00:41:10.166 --> 00:41:11.375
Oh. please. no.

329
00:41:12.458 --> 00:41:15.500
It's not your fault.
We'll get the paperwork started.

330
00:41:20.833 --> 00:41:23.500
When were you gonna tell me Clara hit you?

331
00:41:23.583 --> 00:41:26.333
No. Simón. she didn't hit me.
She's six years old.

332
00:41:26.833 --> 00:41:28.541
-You're leaving?
-I'll be back.

333
00:41:28.625 --> 00:41:31.708
-Paula. we're talking right now. Paula!
-Just watch Clara please.

334
00:41:35.208 --> 00:41:36.125
Watch your step.

335
00:41:38.208 --> 00:41:41.166
You told everyone about it.
Now they're taking her away.

336
00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:43.958
-Yes. because it was--
-Mind your own fucking business.

337
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.208
Are you coming to bed?

338
00:42:08.166 --> 00:42:09.708
Yes. I'll be right there.

339
00:42:39.541 --> 00:42:41.208
VUMA

340
00:42:42.125 --> 00:42:45.083
Clara… I know you understand.

341
00:42:45.916 --> 00:42:47.416
I know you can speak.

342
00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.125
-I'm going.
-Ciao.

343
00:42:49.208 --> 00:42:50.875
Earlier you said "buma."

344
00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.458
-What is "buma"?

345
00:42:57.208 --> 00:42:58.958
No. I can't talk.

346
00:43:00.208 --> 00:43:01.041
Shh.

347
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:04.750
No. I can't talk.

348
00:43:05.833 --> 00:43:07.833
What is that? I can't hear you.

349
00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:15.750
Where is your house?

350
00:43:16.708 --> 00:43:18.416
House. Kreide.

351
00:43:18.916 --> 00:43:20.958
"Kreide?" What is "kreide"?

352
00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:23.750
-Kreide.
-Kreide.

353
00:43:25.166 --> 00:43:29.083
Where's your home?
Is it near here? Is it far away?

354
00:43:29.166 --> 00:43:32.875
-Who do you live with?

355
00:43:37.958 --> 00:43:40.250
-You live with your mama.
-Mama.

356
00:43:41.916 --> 00:43:44.541
-Anyone else?

357
00:43:44.625 --> 00:43:46.541
Do you live with your papa?

358
00:43:46.625 --> 00:43:47.541
BU MAN

359
00:43:52.833 --> 00:43:54.583
Clara. who do you live with?

360
00:43:57.916 --> 00:43:59.541
BOOGEYMAN

361
00:44:15.041 --> 00:44:18.500
If you don't wanna talk to me.
I'll have to erase the chalk.

362
00:44:20.583 --> 00:44:23.250
-Clara!

363
00:45:54.666 --> 00:45:57.916
Clara!

364
00:46:16.458 --> 00:46:18.250
They found her jacket.

365
00:46:23.916 --> 00:46:24.750
Where was it?

366
00:46:25.333 --> 00:46:26.416
In the swamp.

367
00:46:28.166 --> 00:46:29.875
The divers are looking.

368
00:46:31.291 --> 00:46:34.208
-What happened after?
-She-- she was holding me.

369
00:46:35.916 --> 00:46:38.041
And I locked her in to go to the bathroom.

370
00:46:38.541 --> 00:46:41.375
-You locked her in?
-Yes. I mean. with the chalk.

371
00:46:41.458 --> 00:46:43.166
How long were you in the bathroom?

372
00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:45.166
Less than five minutes.

373
00:46:45.875 --> 00:46:48.000
When I came back…

374
00:46:48.083 --> 00:46:49.625
…the door was open and--

375
00:46:50.333 --> 00:46:51.666
And Clara wasn't there.

376
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:53.583
Were you alone in the house?

377
00:46:53.666 --> 00:46:55.458
Yes. I was at work.

378
00:46:56.333 --> 00:46:58.708
Wasn't there a previous incident
with the glass?

379
00:46:59.291 --> 00:47:00.500
Yes. it didn't feel important.

380
00:47:01.541 --> 00:47:03.000
Your neighbor went to the ER.

381
00:47:03.083 --> 00:47:05.500
These kinds of accidents
should be reported.

382
00:47:05.583 --> 00:47:08.875
I was aware of it.
and deciding how to deal with it.

383
00:47:08.958 --> 00:47:10.916
I believe the girl ran away on her own.

384
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.083
No. that's impossible.

385
00:47:12.166 --> 00:47:15.083
-Because the girl won't cross the chalk?
-Exactly.

386
00:47:15.166 --> 00:47:18.625
But we've been informed that
this isn't the first time she disappeared.

387
00:47:18.708 --> 00:47:20.833
and you ran outside
to go and look for her.

388
00:47:22.333 --> 00:47:24.125
No.
I don't think she went outside.

389
00:47:24.208 --> 00:47:27.500
I think that… she was hiding.

390
00:47:27.583 --> 00:47:29.791
Yeah. you dealt with that as well?

391
00:47:31.583 --> 00:47:36.791
Look. I've spent a lot of time with Clara.
and I know she was good with us.

392
00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:40.541
So while you're looking in that swamp.

393
00:47:41.375 --> 00:47:42.625
I ask you.

394
00:47:43.583 --> 00:47:46.000
don't exclude any other options.

395
00:47:49.875 --> 00:47:50.750
All right.

396
00:47:53.083 --> 00:47:55.416
Don't move from here. She might come back.

397
00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:20.666
-You need to talk to Paula.
-Yeah. I know.

398
00:48:21.625 --> 00:48:23.041
I've never seen her like this.

399
00:48:23.125 --> 00:48:26.708
The most important thing is
for her to get back to normal.

400
00:48:26.791 --> 00:48:30.208
-Do you think someone took the girl?
-No. Well. I don't know.

401
00:48:30.291 --> 00:48:32.166
I hope she's not in that swamp.

402
00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:34.458
Don't say that. Paula.

403
00:48:36.125 --> 00:48:37.125
How are you?

404
00:48:40.375 --> 00:48:43.041
Fine. Is there any news?

405
00:48:43.666 --> 00:48:45.416
You only slept for two hours.

406
00:48:48.916 --> 00:48:50.375
You had time to clean.

407
00:48:53.791 --> 00:48:54.958
Are you okay?

408
00:48:55.041 --> 00:48:56.750
Come back to the office.

409
00:48:56.833 --> 00:48:58.625
If you don't.
they'll take your projects away.

410
00:48:59.291 --> 00:49:02.833
It's always nice
to get back to normal. Paula.

411
00:49:06.458 --> 00:49:09.250
Well. do you know
they're moving my due date up?

412
00:49:09.333 --> 00:49:10.875
-Really?

413
00:49:10.958 --> 00:49:14.958
-It'll be born on the same day as Beltrán.
-They told us on the way here.

414
00:49:15.916 --> 00:49:17.375
What a coincidence.

415
00:49:31.583 --> 00:49:32.416
What?

416
00:49:34.041 --> 00:49:36.625
I don't know. Paula.
What do you think?

417
00:49:38.875 --> 00:49:39.875
What do I think?

418
00:49:44.916 --> 00:49:46.916
I'm really happy for you. Beltrán.

419
00:49:48.666 --> 00:49:50.916
-Paula. they're just cheering you up.
-Just shut up.

420
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.458
-Paula. relax.
-Hey!

421
00:49:53.458 --> 00:49:55.750
-Can you get out of my house. please?
-Paula.

422
00:49:55.833 --> 00:49:56.750
Can you all go?

423
00:49:58.333 --> 00:50:00.125
I'll see you out.

424
00:50:16.125 --> 00:50:17.250
I'm sorry.

425
00:50:19.916 --> 00:50:21.500
Simón. I'm so nervous.

426
00:50:23.291 --> 00:50:25.333
-Where is she?
-I don't know.

427
00:50:27.333 --> 00:50:30.750
Well. I can't sit around waiting.

428
00:50:30.833 --> 00:50:32.166
Can you stay here. please?

429
00:50:32.666 --> 00:50:35.166
I don't want
her back in our house.

430
00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:37.333
-What?
-She wasn't doing well.

431
00:50:40.833 --> 00:50:42.125
Yes. you said that.

432
00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:46.208
It's one thing for the others to say it.
but you?

433
00:50:46.291 --> 00:50:49.291
-You think Clara opened the door and ran?
-You've been injecting yourself.

434
00:50:50.041 --> 00:50:52.625
-What?
-How many cycles have you done?

435
00:50:53.125 --> 00:50:54.333
You went to the clinic alone.

436
00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:59.291
I thought we were planning
on being parents together.

437
00:51:00.416 --> 00:51:01.875
Were you gonna tell me?

438
00:51:01.958 --> 00:51:03.458
I didn't go to the clinic.

439
00:51:03.541 --> 00:51:06.625
The shots were in the bathroom.
Hidden. but they were there.

440
00:51:07.875 --> 00:51:10.625
It's what I had left over from before.

441
00:51:10.708 --> 00:51:12.208
So just one cycle?

442
00:51:12.875 --> 00:51:14.500
-I wanted to do one.
-How many?

443
00:51:15.791 --> 00:51:17.833
I wanted to do one. but it didn't work.

444
00:51:17.916 --> 00:51:20.916
-And I thought I could do another one.
-So you won't answer.

445
00:51:39.708 --> 00:51:41.333
Okay. hang on. Simón.

446
00:51:41.958 --> 00:51:45.541
You're right. I should have told you
I did. but I didn't want you to worry.

447
00:51:45.625 --> 00:51:47.875
-How could you do that?
-I couldn't take it.

448
00:51:47.958 --> 00:51:51.541
But we talked about it. We agreed
that we would take a break for a year.

449
00:51:51.625 --> 00:51:54.583
I'm sorry. I couldn't.

450
00:51:54.666 --> 00:51:57.583
We've gone through six years
of treatments and doctors.

451
00:51:58.541 --> 00:52:00.625
Don't you remember how it was for us?

452
00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:04.041
Yes. we were tired.

453
00:52:04.125 --> 00:52:06.458
No. we were bad.

454
00:52:12.958 --> 00:52:15.416
All right. so.

455
00:52:17.125 --> 00:52:18.958
you think you're on your own with this?

456
00:52:19.041 --> 00:52:20.666
No. I've never thought that.

457
00:52:21.333 --> 00:52:23.541
You just said a moment ago
you didn't wanna worry me.

458
00:52:23.625 --> 00:52:25.166
It's not about that.

459
00:52:27.625 --> 00:52:30.500
I wish I could have done more.

460
00:52:31.291 --> 00:52:32.333
Taken on more.

461
00:52:35.333 --> 00:52:37.791
This is for us. my love. I promise.

462
00:52:39.083 --> 00:52:40.583
All right then. so?

463
00:52:41.083 --> 00:52:43.500
I wanted to sit you down and tell you.

464
00:52:45.083 --> 00:52:46.875
"Hey. guess what. we're pregnant."

465
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:49.083
No.

466
00:52:49.166 --> 00:52:51.416
Yes. it's as simple
and as difficult as that.

467
00:52:52.708 --> 00:52:55.750
But you decided all on your own.

468
00:52:55.833 --> 00:52:59.333
-I felt strong enough. Simón.
-How can you be strong enough if I'm not?

469
00:52:59.416 --> 00:53:00.416
We're different.

470
00:53:01.416 --> 00:53:02.250
Yes.

471
00:53:02.916 --> 00:53:05.250
Yes. you took
that thing you said was ours.

472
00:53:05.833 --> 00:53:07.833
and you made it yours alone.

473
00:53:09.791 --> 00:53:11.583
It's the same with the girl.

474
00:53:12.625 --> 00:53:15.833
What? I'm confused.
This has nothing to do with Clara.

475
00:53:15.916 --> 00:53:19.500
You didn't include me. Paula.
You became obsessed.

476
00:53:19.583 --> 00:53:21.500
-Locked yourself up.
-I don't see it like that.

477
00:53:21.583 --> 00:53:22.500
-You don't?
-No.

478
00:53:22.583 --> 00:53:24.458
We've been sleeping apart for weeks.

479
00:53:24.541 --> 00:53:26.791
You've been hiding things
and attack people who disagree.

480
00:53:26.875 --> 00:53:29.125
-I'm not hiding anything.
-She hit you.

481
00:53:29.208 --> 00:53:31.458
No. she didn't hit me.
She's six years old. Simón.

482
00:53:31.541 --> 00:53:33.291
-She ran away.
-She was hiding!

483
00:53:33.375 --> 00:53:35.625
-You don't care what I say.
-I forced her to speak to me.

484
00:53:35.708 --> 00:53:37.583
You're always going to
have an explanation.

485
00:53:37.666 --> 00:53:39.750
Do you know what my explanation
is right now?

486
00:53:39.833 --> 00:53:41.000
What?

487
00:53:41.083 --> 00:53:43.625
-That I devoted myself to that girl.
-I didn't?

488
00:53:43.708 --> 00:53:46.958
I accepted the responsibility
we had to that girl.

489
00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:49.250
That's different from an obsession.

490
00:53:49.333 --> 00:53:51.583
No. you insisted
on keeping that girl here in this house

491
00:53:51.666 --> 00:53:53.875
when they should have taken
her away weeks ago.

492
00:53:53.958 --> 00:53:57.083
-That's what's going on.
-That's your idea of being a father?

493
00:53:57.166 --> 00:54:00.625
I am not her father.

494
00:54:02.916 --> 00:54:04.291
I'm not her mother.

495
00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:09.875
I don't understand why you
wanted to bring her home. then.

496
00:54:09.958 --> 00:54:11.750
-The truth?
-Yes. please.

497
00:54:11.833 --> 00:54:14.541
Because I thought it would
be good for us. good for you.

498
00:54:16.291 --> 00:54:17.833
But you're saying you were neglected?

499
00:54:24.083 --> 00:54:26.041
Can you explain this to me?

500
00:54:35.833 --> 00:54:37.041
Explain it.

501
00:54:39.291 --> 00:54:40.833
Take a bath. eat something.

502
00:55:08.833 --> 00:55:09.708
Yes.

503
00:55:12.541 --> 00:55:13.375
Hello.

504
00:55:14.041 --> 00:55:14.875
Mama?

505
00:55:15.791 --> 00:55:16.750
Clara?

506
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:18.875
Clara. where are you?

507
00:55:19.375 --> 00:55:20.208
Mama.

508
00:55:21.208 --> 00:55:22.083
Are you okay?

509
00:55:23.208 --> 00:55:24.750
Ho-- honey. what's wrong?

510
00:55:44.416 --> 00:55:46.500
Fine. All right. See ya.

511
00:55:48.083 --> 00:55:49.333
You have any news?

512
00:55:49.416 --> 00:55:51.916
We're studying cases from all over Europe.

513
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.125
We're leaving no stone unturned.

514
00:56:05.208 --> 00:56:06.583
Have you traced the phone call?

515
00:56:07.291 --> 00:56:10.166
We know the number
from which the call was made.

516
00:56:14.541 --> 00:56:16.791
Have you had your phone stolen recently?

517
00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:21.250
-No.
-Then it was you who made the call.

518
00:56:23.416 --> 00:56:24.333
Of course I didn't.

519
00:56:24.916 --> 00:56:26.500
Is that your number?

520
00:56:26.583 --> 00:56:28.333
Yes. that's my cellphone number.

521
00:56:29.625 --> 00:56:33.041
Simón. I know she called me.

522
00:56:34.208 --> 00:56:36.416
Please. help me explain.
You were there too.

523
00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:38.375
No. Paula. I had left.

524
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.625
They are going to give
you a psychological exam.

525
00:56:41.708 --> 00:56:43.875
I don't need a psychologist. No.

526
00:56:43.958 --> 00:56:46.208
Then go ahead
and tell us everything you know.

527
00:56:46.916 --> 00:56:50.583
The worst thing that can happen
to that girl is to let more time go by.

528
00:56:50.666 --> 00:56:54.291
All right.
I explained this already.

529
00:56:55.458 --> 00:56:57.875
I heard her perfectly calling me "Mama."

530
00:57:04.625 --> 00:57:05.875
Full name?

531
00:57:06.375 --> 00:57:08.083
Paula Ejea Guzmán.

532
00:57:09.625 --> 00:57:11.541
-Age?
-Forty-two years old.

533
00:57:16.583 --> 00:57:19.166
You have to
leave your phone with us.

534
00:57:27.250 --> 00:57:28.333

Let's go home.

537
00:57:54.416 --> 00:57:56.166
I need to go for a walk.

538
00:57:56.250 --> 00:57:58.833
-I'll go with you.
-I need time to think about this.

539
00:57:58.916 --> 00:58:00.708
Well. let's think together. Paula--

Various marks

573
01:02:48.250 --> 01:02:49.083

I BEG YOU

581
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.166
CIVIL GUARD HASN'T REVEALED WHETHER
THE PARENTS ARE SUSPECTS OF CHILD ABUSE

582
01:03:53.125 --> 01:03:56.375
It happened on a beach in Málaga
on the fifth of June in 2011.

583
01:03:56.458 --> 01:03:59.166
Ingrid Morand disappeared without a trace.

584
01:03:59.250 --> 01:04:02.375
{\an8}A year later. her parents haven't
given up hope of finding her.

585
01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:07.625
She's very kind-hearted
and has a great imagination.

586
01:04:09.708 --> 01:04:12.166
I'm sure she really misses her bedroom.

587
01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:15.333
So please. bring our Ingrid back.

588
01:04:15.416 --> 01:04:17.041
She's our only daughter.

589
01:04:18.083 --> 01:04:21.958
She's always making little crafts
that she gives to us and her friends.

590
01:04:23.875 --> 01:04:25.750
She says they are guardian angels

591
01:04:25.833 --> 01:04:27.583
and that they protect us from bad things.

592
01:04:29.250 --> 01:04:31.875
…guardian angels and that
they protect us from bad things.

Simón.

594
01:04:48.083 --> 01:04:48.916

I'M AT THE POLICE STATION. CALL ME

596
01:06:39.291 --> 01:06:41.958
-Emergency.
-My name is Paula Ejea.

597
01:06:42.041 --> 01:06:44.416
My neighbor Eduardo Olivares
may have something to do

598
01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:47.208
with a missing little girl.
Please. you have to come here.

599
01:06:47.291 --> 01:06:49.916
-Is your daughter missing?
-No. no. no. She's not my daughter.

600
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.666
But my neighbor Eduardo Olivares may have
something to do with her disappearance.

601
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:55.500
and also Ingrid Morand's.

602
01:06:55.583 --> 01:06:57.708
Please. you have to hurry. My address is--

603
01:06:57.791 --> 01:07:00.791
I can see your address on my monitor.
My colleagues are on their way.

604
01:07:00.875 --> 01:07:03.208
We ask that
you wait inside your house. please.

605
01:08:26.958 --> 01:08:29.833
-No. stand up. Stand up.

606
01:08:32.333 --> 01:08:33.208
You can walk.

607
01:08:35.958 --> 01:08:38.541
Go that way. toward those lights.

608
01:08:42.708 --> 01:08:43.916
You can't talk.

609
01:08:45.916 --> 01:08:47.208
Let me see you go.

610
01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:57.500
I'll come back for you. but you're sick.

611
01:09:00.250 --> 01:09:01.500
-Look.

612
01:09:06.583 --> 01:09:09.500
See? Follow the chalk line.

613
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.125
-Follow the chalk line.

614
01:09:44.250 --> 01:09:46.250
Have the doctors agreed to this?

615
01:09:48.083 --> 01:09:49.875
Have the doctors agreed to this?

616
01:09:50.375 --> 01:09:53.541
That girl should be in a hospital.
looked after by professional doctors.

617
01:09:57.708 --> 01:09:59.583
Have the doctors agreed to this?

618
01:10:20.916 --> 01:10:21.958
What did she say?

619
01:10:22.041 --> 01:10:24.333
It's random words.
nothing understandable.

620
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000
A psychologist thinks
she'll start talking little by little.

621
01:10:28.583 --> 01:10:30.791
She said "mama."
She probably lived with her.

622
01:10:30.875 --> 01:10:33.375
-And her dad?
-Nothing about him.

623
01:10:33.458 --> 01:10:35.541
Are you gonna
teach her to speak. then?

624
01:10:35.625 --> 01:10:38.208
We're wondering if it's
a matter of her gaining confidence.

625
01:10:38.291 --> 01:10:40.583
-You need a glass.

626
01:10:40.666 --> 01:10:42.333
-Oh. yes.
-I'll go. I'll go.

627
01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:44.333
Thank you.

628
01:11:32.375 --> 01:11:33.208
Clara?

629
01:11:49.666 --> 01:11:53.541
What are you doing in here alone?
Do you want some water or juice?

630
01:12:02.583 --> 01:12:04.416
What are you doing? Drawing?

631
01:12:21.708 --> 01:12:23.375
Hey. the washing machine broke.

632
01:12:27.958 --> 01:12:28.833
Good morning.

633
01:12:35.625 --> 01:12:36.958
Everything's fine!

634
01:12:52.250 --> 01:12:55.208
-Is there more?
-No. but I can make you something else.

635
01:12:56.125 --> 01:12:57.208
It's okay.

636
01:12:57.708 --> 01:12:59.458
Get the leftovers from the fridge.

637
01:13:00.375 --> 01:13:01.333
It's no trouble.

638
01:13:02.208 --> 01:13:03.750
How would you like an omelet?

639
01:13:03.833 --> 01:13:06.000
Just take out the leftovers in the fridge.

640
01:13:15.875 --> 01:13:16.708
Maite.

641
01:13:19.583 --> 01:13:20.416
What?

642
01:13:20.958 --> 01:13:23.416
I had put those beans aside for tomorrow.

643
01:13:25.541 --> 01:13:26.541
What for?

644
01:13:28.333 --> 01:13:29.458
Don't you remember?

645
01:13:30.041 --> 01:13:32.250
You're on your own tomorrow.
I won't be here.

646
01:13:33.125 --> 01:13:34.000
Where are you going?

647
01:13:34.750 --> 01:13:36.875
I'm going to Barcelona to see the boys.

648
01:13:40.708 --> 01:13:43.083
I told you.
they've finished all their exams.

649
01:13:45.083 --> 01:13:46.541
You didn't tell me.

650
01:13:49.833 --> 01:13:50.958
Did you forget?

651
01:13:51.875 --> 01:13:54.166
You told me I could go.
You gave me permission.

652
01:13:56.958 --> 01:13:57.791
No.

653
01:13:58.291 --> 01:14:01.541
You even told me where to have lunch.
where you went that time.

654
01:14:01.625 --> 01:14:05.125
-When you went with your co-workers.
-Well. as you wish.

655
01:14:05.208 --> 01:14:07.791
But tomorrow we agreed
to meet Paula and Simón.

656
01:14:08.875 --> 01:14:10.541
But you can go without me. right?

657
01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:17.333
Why don't you call the boys. hmm?

658
01:14:17.916 --> 01:14:21.291
And you can tell them to come here.
It's been so long.

659
01:14:29.708 --> 01:14:30.916
I think they're busy.

660
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.583
I thought you said
they finished their exams.

661
01:14:33.666 --> 01:14:36.333
They might have started their classes
for the second term.

662
01:14:36.416 --> 01:14:37.583
They work hard.

663
01:14:37.666 --> 01:14:40.875
I think they could come home
for a couple days if they wanted. hmm?

664
01:14:48.958 --> 01:14:49.791
You're right.

665
01:14:53.291 --> 01:14:54.958
Paula and Simón are not well.

666
01:14:56.208 --> 01:14:57.750
I can go some other time.

667
01:15:00.166 --> 01:15:01.333
Are you sure?

668
01:15:02.583 --> 01:15:03.416
Yes.

669
01:15:17.583 --> 01:15:19.250
-Do you have to work?
-Yes.

670
01:15:42.833 --> 01:15:44.083
And the police?

671
01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.041
They are stumped.

672
01:15:46.625 --> 01:15:49.583
-What are they saying?
-They thought she ran away.

673
01:15:49.666 --> 01:15:52.000
But there's a detective
who believes Paula.

674
01:15:52.083 --> 01:15:53.958
so they're investigating more.

675
01:15:54.041 --> 01:15:56.708
The most important thing is
for her to get back to normal.

676
01:15:56.791 --> 01:15:58.583
Do you think
someone took the girl?

677
01:15:58.666 --> 01:16:02.166
No. Well. I don't know.
I hope she's not in that swamp.

678
01:16:02.250 --> 01:16:04.666
Don't say that. Paula.

679
01:16:06.166 --> 01:16:07.083
How are you?

680
01:16:08.333 --> 01:16:09.166
Fine.

681
01:16:11.250 --> 01:16:12.166
Is there any news?

682
01:16:13.833 --> 01:16:15.708
You only slept for two hours.

683
01:16:16.583 --> 01:16:18.083
You had time to clean.

684
01:16:20.916 --> 01:16:22.291
Are you okay?

685
01:16:22.375 --> 01:16:24.083
Come back to the office.

686
01:16:24.166 --> 01:16:26.666
If you don't.
they'll take your projects away.

687
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:29.958
It's always nice
to get back to normal. Paula.

688
01:16:30.041 --> 01:16:31.583
Tell her. she'll be happy.

689
01:16:39.666 --> 01:16:42.208
Well. do you know
they're moving my due date up?

690
01:16:42.291 --> 01:16:43.458
-Really?

691
01:16:43.541 --> 01:16:46.000
It'll be born
on the same day as Beltrán.

692
01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:48.416
They told us on the way here.

693
01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:50.250
-What a coincidence.

694
01:17:00.083 --> 01:17:00.916
What?

695
01:17:02.083 --> 01:17:04.416
I don't know. Paula.
What do you think?

696
01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000
What do I think?

697
01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.625
I'm really happy for you. Beltrán.

698
01:17:12.333 --> 01:17:15.333
-Paula. they're just cheering you up.
-Just shut up.

699
01:17:15.416 --> 01:17:17.291
-Paula. relax.
-Hey!

700
01:17:18.125 --> 01:17:20.625
-Can you get out of my house. please?
-Paula.

701
01:17:20.708 --> 01:17:21.875
Can you all go?

702
01:17:23.125 --> 01:17:25.333
-Let's go.
-I'll see you out.

703
01:18:22.875 --> 01:18:23.708
Hello.

704
01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:28.333
Hello.

705
01:18:30.250 --> 01:18:31.375
You okay?

706
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:32.958
Yes.

707
01:18:35.125 --> 01:18:36.166
Are you alone?

708
01:18:36.750 --> 01:18:37.583
Yeah.

709
01:18:38.833 --> 01:18:39.666
Why?

710
01:18:40.875 --> 01:18:44.083
Maite told me to come over
and pick something up.

711
01:18:45.541 --> 01:18:46.375
What?

712
01:18:47.958 --> 01:18:48.791
Some maps.

713
01:18:49.458 --> 01:18:51.000
She said I could borrow them.

714
01:18:51.958 --> 01:18:53.083
Oh. she didn't tell me.

715
01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.083
Well. come in.

716
01:19:00.083 --> 01:19:01.291
I'll find them.

717
01:19:09.833 --> 01:19:11.416
Let's see if they're here.

718
01:19:12.375 --> 01:19:13.750
Why do you need maps?

719
01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:15.958
I'm going to keep looking.

720
01:19:17.625 --> 01:19:18.708
For the girl?

721
01:19:19.916 --> 01:19:20.916
Yes.

722
01:19:22.708 --> 01:19:24.083
Have you heard anything?

723
01:19:25.041 --> 01:19:25.875
Nothing.

724
01:19:45.041 --> 01:19:48.208
That Maite.

725
01:19:52.250 --> 01:19:54.333
Wait a second. They might be in here.

726
01:23:50.916 --> 01:23:53.250
-Yes.
-Are you Eduardo Olivares?

727
01:23:53.333 --> 01:23:54.541
Yes. that's me.

728
01:23:54.625 --> 01:23:56.166
We received a call.

729
01:23:56.250 --> 01:23:58.375
We would like to ask you
some questions if possible.

730
01:23:58.458 --> 01:24:00.916
Paula Ejea called you.
didn't she?

731
01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.500
Ah. don't stay out there. Come in.

732
01:25:27.166 --> 01:25:28.750
I told the police.

733
01:25:29.333 --> 01:25:30.625
They're gone now.

734
01:25:35.333 --> 01:25:38.375
They'll find me.

735
01:25:41.541 --> 01:25:43.500
Tell me. Paula. how did you know?

736
01:25:51.625 --> 01:25:52.916
I found Ingrid.

737
01:25:54.208 --> 01:25:55.583
You found Ingrid?

738
01:25:57.416 --> 01:25:58.750
Ingrid's autopsy.

739
01:26:01.041 --> 01:26:01.875
Where?

740
01:26:09.166 --> 01:26:10.208
Where. Paula?

741
01:26:10.750 --> 01:26:13.416
It's in-- I left it in my car.

742
01:26:18.375 --> 01:26:20.208
Are you lying right now?

743
01:26:22.666 --> 01:26:24.416
-Are you lying to me?
-No.

744
01:28:10.875 --> 01:28:11.875
Paula?

745
01:28:21.291 --> 01:28:23.875
Clara. listen to me. please.

746
01:28:24.458 --> 01:28:27.125
This is very important.
I need you to help me.

747
01:28:27.833 --> 01:28:29.041
Will you do that?

748
01:28:34.166 --> 01:28:36.833
Watch very carefully. Look here.

749
01:28:44.791 --> 01:28:46.041
Clara. take this.

750
01:28:53.375 --> 01:28:55.625
Too far.

751
01:29:10.666 --> 01:29:12.958
-I have it!

752
01:29:25.333 --> 01:29:27.458
Try please and if you want. we can stop.

753
01:29:27.541 --> 01:29:31.166
-No. don't-- don't want to.
-Clara. listen to me.

754
01:29:31.250 --> 01:29:33.916
-You don't have to be afraid. please.

755
01:29:37.708 --> 01:29:39.291
I know it's difficult. honey.

756
01:29:40.583 --> 01:29:42.000
but you can do it.

757
01:29:42.875 --> 01:29:46.041
Do you know why?
Because you're the bravest girl I know.

758
01:29:48.166 --> 01:29:49.875
I haven't met anyone in this world

759
01:29:49.958 --> 01:29:52.583
who is as brave of a person
as you are. my dear.

760
01:29:54.416 --> 01:29:55.750
So please. Clara.

761
01:29:57.875 --> 01:29:59.000
Do it for both of us.

762
01:30:33.791 --> 01:30:35.666
Clara. are you in the closet?

763
01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:38.458
I don't want
Mama's punishment here.

764
01:30:38.541 --> 01:30:39.958
Was your mama here?

765
01:30:42.583 --> 01:30:43.916
Yeah.

766
01:30:47.666 --> 01:30:49.375
Your mama's name was Ingrid?

767
01:30:51.125 --> 01:30:53.375
-Yeah.

768
01:32:11.875 --> 01:32:13.041
Where is she?

769
01:32:21.250 --> 01:32:22.083
Clara.

770
01:32:24.625 --> 01:32:25.458
Honey.

771
01:32:38.666 --> 01:32:39.833
Where is she?

772
01:32:43.541 --> 01:32:47.791
-Where is she?

773
01:32:51.625 --> 01:32:53.541
Where is she?

774
01:33:00.083 --> 01:33:03.500
-Tell me now! Where is she?

775
01:33:06.333 --> 01:33:07.541

Clara! Clara! Clara!

778
01:34:37.875 --> 01:34:38.708
Simón!

779
01:34:39.333 --> 01:34:40.625
Simón!

780
01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:48.375
Simón!

781
01:34:54.583 --> 01:34:55.875
Simón!

782
01:35:01.125 --> 01:35:02.166
Simón!

783
01:35:04.250 --> 01:35:05.666
Simón!

784
01:35:50.833 --> 01:35:52.375
Simón!

785
01:35:52.458 --> 01:35:54.708
Yes. I just got home.
She's not here.

786
01:35:55.958 --> 01:35:56.958
Simón!

787
01:35:57.708 --> 01:35:59.750
How can she contact me
if they took her phone?

788
01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:02.291
-Simón!
-Hello.

789
01:36:07.625 --> 01:36:09.291
What are you doing here?

790
01:36:10.708 --> 01:36:11.666
Are you Clara?

791
01:36:12.625 --> 01:36:13.541
Are you all right?

792
01:36:16.833 --> 01:36:17.750
Where's Paula?

793
01:36:34.708 --> 01:36:35.625
Calm down.

794
01:36:40.708 --> 01:36:42.375
Calm down. relax.

795
01:36:43.833 --> 01:36:44.791
It's all fine.

796
01:36:46.666 --> 01:36:49.458
Relax. come here. Come here.

797
01:36:51.375 --> 01:36:52.750
Everything's fine.

798
01:36:54.625 --> 01:36:56.416
It's over. Calm down.

799
01:37:08.875 --> 01:37:09.916
Simón!

800
01:37:13.708 --> 01:37:17.458
What do you mean stay at home?
No. no. no. no. no. you listen to me.

801
01:38:07.625 --> 01:38:09.125
This is how things will work.

802
01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:19.541
I'll go to see the boys whenever I want.

803
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:26.916
You'll give me money
for the tickets and for food.

804
01:38:27.791 --> 01:38:30.416
-I'll go. and then I'll come home.

805
01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:31.833
I'll be here as usual.

806
01:38:33.083 --> 01:38:36.625
But you'll never ask about them again.
and they never have to come back here.

807
01:38:44.291 --> 01:38:45.416
And the basement?

808
01:38:53.791 --> 01:38:54.625
Thank you.

809
01:38:59.666 --> 01:39:02.625
I'm not doing it for you.
I'm doing it for my sons.

810
01:39:03.833 --> 01:39:04.791
And now?

811
01:39:07.833 --> 01:39:09.416
Now I'll make some coffee.

812
01:39:38.750 --> 01:39:40.833
I'm going out to the garden for a while.

813
01:40:14.208 --> 01:40:17.041
Police!
Hands in the air! Don't move!

814
01:40:18.166 --> 01:40:19.041
Where are they?

815
01:40:21.458 --> 01:40:23.500
Did you hear me? Where are they?

816
01:41:21.291 --> 01:41:23.916
-Hey. there!

817
01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.125

You look great.

820
01:41:32.333 --> 01:41:33.916
How's your grandmother?

821
01:41:34.458 --> 01:41:35.375
Oma?

822
01:41:35.458 --> 01:41:38.125
Pass the phone to her later.
I wanna say hello.

823
01:41:38.708 --> 01:41:40.958
It looks beautiful in Hamburg.

824
01:41:41.708 --> 01:41:42.791
Sunny!

825
01:41:43.833 --> 01:41:44.791
Look here.

826
01:41:44.875 --> 01:41:47.375
It's cloudy today. see?

827
01:41:50.541 --> 01:41:52.125
How's your ankle doing?

828
01:41:52.208 --> 01:41:54.083
Can you walk on it? A bit?

829
01:41:54.625 --> 01:41:57.875
That's amazing!

830
01:41:57.958 --> 01:41:59.166
Simón.

831
01:41:59.791 --> 01:42:01.958
Look who just got home. Hang on a moment.

832
01:42:06.750 --> 01:42:08.916
