PAIN ELIMINATING PLASTER

5
00:02:01.625 --> 00:02:03.833
MR. LIU

6
00:02:03.916 --> 00:02:05.125
Grandma.

7
00:02:07.875 --> 00:02:08.833
Grandma.

8
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.416
Grandma!

9
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.083
Grandma.

10
00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.166
Grandma.

11
00:02:20.916 --> 00:02:22.333
Grandma.

12
00:02:27.208 --> 00:02:29.333
Xixi. what's the matter with you?

13
00:02:29.416 --> 00:02:30.875
Do you play me for a fool?

14
00:02:31.541 --> 00:02:32.833
I called you and texted you

15
00:02:32.916 --> 00:02:34.083
on WeChat every single day.

16
00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:36.333
you don't answer my calls
or reply to my texts.

17
00:02:36.416 --> 00:02:37.916
What are you doing?

18
00:02:44.583 --> 00:02:45.500
Xixi.

19
00:02:46.375 --> 00:02:49.208
I'm sorry.
I was a bit agitated in my speech.

20
00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.625
It's just that I missed you so much.

21
00:02:51.708 --> 00:02:53.125
JIANREN

22
00:02:54.333 --> 00:02:55.208
What is it?

23
00:02:55.291 --> 00:02:56.416
<i>This isn't working.</i>

24
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.625
<i>You should do it.</i>

25
00:02:57.708 --> 00:02:58.708
<i>Her body has gotten stiff.</i>

26
00:02:58.791 --> 00:02:59.875
JIANREN

27
00:03:24.458 --> 00:03:25.333
San.

28
00:03:25.416 --> 00:03:26.875
quite a haircut you got there.

29
00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.750
My head looks like your dad's.

30
00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:30.250
What are you talking about?

31
00:03:30.333 --> 00:03:31.458
I am your dad!

32
00:03:39.083 --> 00:03:40.041
Hot water.

33
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:41.458
Towel.

34
00:04:37.166 --> 00:04:38.916
Don't touch my grandma!

35
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.583
-Don't touch my grandma!
-What are you doing?

36
00:04:41.666 --> 00:04:42.583
Don't touch her!

37
00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:44.375
Don't touch my grandma!

38
00:04:44.458 --> 00:04:45.625
Let me down!

39
00:04:45.708 --> 00:04:47.041
Don't touch my grandma!

40
00:04:47.625 --> 00:04:50.041
-Don't touch my grandma! Let me down!
-The topic of my speech is

41
00:04:50.125 --> 00:04:51.625
-"I Love My Home".
-Look after your sister. Xiaowu.

42
00:04:53.833 --> 00:04:55.250
Let me out of here!

43
00:04:55.333 --> 00:04:58.375
Feet widened. shoes donned.
on the main road you go.

44
00:04:58.458 --> 00:05:00.916
may you cross
the Bridge of Forgetfulness safely.

45
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.666
-It's 10 a.m. in Chunhui Hall.
-Go to heaven

46
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.291
-and return to your rightful place.
-Qingtian Funeral Parlor.

47
00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:05.958
-Mr. Liu is coming.
-Bless your children

48
00:05:06.041 --> 00:05:07.708
-Get there early to find a parking spot.
-with riches.

49
00:05:07.791 --> 00:05:10.750
{\an8}Seriously. Your mom just has
to pick this time to go.

50
00:05:10.833 --> 00:05:12.541
As if we weren't busy enough already.

51
00:05:12.625 --> 00:05:14.666
Can't we postpone
the mourning until tomorrow?

52
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.333
I want to keep her here for an extra day.

53
00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:18.541
I don't think we can cancel
today's tickets to Beijing.

54
00:05:18.625 --> 00:05:21.000
-I'm not going.
-Since when do you have a say in this?

55
00:05:21.083 --> 00:05:22.291
I'm warning you.

56
00:05:22.375 --> 00:05:24.750
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance
for our son.

57
00:05:29.416 --> 00:05:31.083
Even if you spend
a few more days with her.

58
00:05:31.166 --> 00:05:32.583
she's gone anyway.

59
00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:34.041
How about this?

60
00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:36.250
Let's just be with her
a little while longer. okay?

61
00:05:39.041 --> 00:05:39.958
Stop there!

62
00:05:41.333 --> 00:05:44.583
Where's the ancestral gold ring
on your mom's finger?

63
00:05:45.708 --> 00:05:46.916
What are you implying?

64
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.500
Do you dare steal from the dead?

65
00:05:48.583 --> 00:05:49.708
Are you not afraid of karma?

66
00:05:49.791 --> 00:05:51.791
-What are you talking about?
-Stealing?

67
00:05:51.875 --> 00:05:53.500
-I didn't steal it.
-Stop talking nonsense.

68
00:05:53.583 --> 00:05:55.125
We didn't steal anything.

69
00:05:55.208 --> 00:05:57.250
Then how will you prove
that you're innocent?

70
00:05:57.791 --> 00:06:00.125
See? We didn't steal it.

71
00:06:00.208 --> 00:06:01.291
The ring is tiny.

72
00:06:01.375 --> 00:06:03.041
You could've hidden it anywhere.

73
00:06:18.208 --> 00:06:19.125
Search me then.

74
00:06:20.375 --> 00:06:21.291
Search me.

75
00:06:21.916 --> 00:06:22.916
Search.

76
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.916
Pervert!

77
00:06:25.083 --> 00:06:26.166
Don't run away!

78
00:06:27.791 --> 00:06:30.458
Don't make false accusations
unless you catch him red-handed.

79
00:06:30.541 --> 00:06:32.750
This is San. He just got out of prison.

80
00:06:32.833 --> 00:06:35.000
I see that your mouths are running loose.

81
00:06:35.083 --> 00:06:36.166
Why don't I tighten them up for you?

82
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.416
San.

83
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.416
The van from the crematorium is here.
Shall we go?

84
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.625
I'm done with this job.

85
00:06:40.708 --> 00:06:41.958
We're not even paid yet.

86
00:06:46.291 --> 00:06:47.291
<i>Mom.</i>

87
00:06:47.375 --> 00:06:49.708
Have a safe journey to the next world!

88
00:06:50.541 --> 00:06:51.416
Rise.

89
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.666
Your grandma
is in that big box over there.

90
00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.791
Mom.

91
00:07:03.458 --> 00:07:05.041
She's being taken to the crematorium

92
00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:06.291
where she'll be burnt to ash

93
00:07:06.375 --> 00:07:07.666
and buried in a grave.

94
00:07:08.375 --> 00:07:10.541
Rubbish! I'll tear
that blabbering mouth off your face!

95
00:07:10.625 --> 00:07:12.791
She's dead and you'll never see her again.

96
00:07:12.875 --> 00:07:14.416
Don't you dare say that!

97
00:07:21.708 --> 00:07:23.125
{\an8}Drive slowly.

98
00:07:35.666 --> 00:07:38.458
UP SKY

99
00:08:05.875 --> 00:08:07.625
San. another one gone.

100
00:08:07.708 --> 00:08:09.541
Sooner or later.
I will make you gone as well.

101
00:08:09.625 --> 00:08:10.625
Take this.

102
00:08:11.125 --> 00:08:13.500
Good stuff. A whole pack next time.

103
00:08:13.583 --> 00:08:16.333
Can't you park your van somewhere else?
Build some good karma.

104
00:08:17.041 --> 00:08:20.125
My van. my own doorstep.
It's none of your business.

105
00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:21.416
You're in the funeral business.

106
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.208
With your van in front of my wedding shop.

107
00:08:23.291 --> 00:08:24.666
how will we attract customers?

108
00:08:25.416 --> 00:08:26.500
Xiaopang. come here.

109
00:08:26.583 --> 00:08:28.083
This is for dead people.
Go wash your hands.

110
00:08:28.166 --> 00:08:31.333
{\an8}Yes. listen to your mom
and remember to use boiling water.

111
00:08:31.416 --> 00:08:33.416
Otherwise. your hands will rot.

112
00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.416
You should wash that mouth of yours.

113
00:08:38.375 --> 00:08:40.625
Just park your van further away.

114
00:08:42.291 --> 00:08:43.416
And why should I do that?

115
00:08:43.916 --> 00:08:45.375
Who do you think you are?

116
00:08:49.291 --> 00:08:50.166
<i>Have a peach.</i>

117
00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:51.583
{\an8}Sir. have a peach.

118
00:08:51.666 --> 00:08:53.958
{\an8}You make the days go by
like tasteless porridge.

119
00:08:54.041 --> 00:08:56.208
Somehow. you've managed a whole year.

120
00:08:56.291 --> 00:08:57.708
I shall keep my promise.

121
00:08:57.791 --> 00:08:58.833
The store

122
00:08:58.916 --> 00:08:59.833
is yours.

123
00:09:06.208 --> 00:09:07.083
Our business…

124
00:09:07.166 --> 00:09:10.250
The capable one looks down on it.
the weak one can't stand it.

125
00:09:10.333 --> 00:09:14.250
The three books of work notes
are written by your grandpa. me.

126
00:09:14.333 --> 00:09:16.958
and your older brother.

127
00:09:17.041 --> 00:09:18.916
Learn from them and carry on our legacy.

128
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.583
Make notes with each deceased we send off.

129
00:09:21.666 --> 00:09:23.666
I will inspect the books regularly.

130
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:24.666
Sure. Dad.

131
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:25.750
I got it.

132
00:09:26.833 --> 00:09:29.166
Now kneel and pay respects
to your granddad and your brother.

133
00:09:30.291 --> 00:09:31.208
My big sister.

134
00:09:31.875 --> 00:09:33.666
this isn't necessary. right?

135
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:35.083
Just do it. Kneel.

136
00:09:35.166 --> 00:09:36.000
Hurry up.

137
00:09:40.083 --> 00:09:42.375
Grandpa. here's your grandson's kowtow.

138
00:09:46.083 --> 00:09:47.833
Why don't we skip the one for my brother?

139
00:09:47.916 --> 00:09:49.500
I've never even known him.

140
00:09:49.583 --> 00:09:50.791
Put that down.

141
00:09:51.875 --> 00:09:52.833
I'll do it in his name.

142
00:09:52.916 --> 00:09:54.958
Here's one for his grandpa.

143
00:09:55.041 --> 00:09:56.708
Here's another one for his older brother.

144
00:09:57.291 --> 00:09:58.416
Done.

145
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.708
Take your ID card
and go change this property's ownership.

146
00:10:03.291 --> 00:10:04.916
I can wait.
Let's do the transfer tomorrow.

147
00:10:07.583 --> 00:10:08.458
Where is this?

148
00:10:08.541 --> 00:10:09.708
I have a picture.

149
00:10:09.791 --> 00:10:10.833
Follow this road.

150
00:10:11.583 --> 00:10:12.500
It's over there.

151
00:10:13.166 --> 00:10:14.916
Remember now? That way.

152
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Thank you. ma'am.

153
00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:28.125
Open the door.

154
00:10:29.708 --> 00:10:30.625
Open the door.

155
00:10:31.625 --> 00:10:32.583
Open up.

156
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.416
I can hear your ringtone.

157
00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:43.375
Open up!

158
00:10:48.166 --> 00:10:49.333
What are you doing here?

159
00:10:49.416 --> 00:10:50.291
Why are you closed?

160
00:10:50.375 --> 00:10:52.125
Didn't I text you?

161
00:10:52.208 --> 00:10:53.041
We're broken up.

162
00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:55.583
Believe me or not.

163
00:10:55.666 --> 00:10:57.875
I'd smash my way in
if you don't open the door right now.

164
00:11:02.666 --> 00:11:04.833
I got the ownership of my dad's house.

165
00:11:04.916 --> 00:11:06.083
You get out!

166
00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:08.625
{\an8}What's your stupid house
have to do with me?

167
00:11:08.708 --> 00:11:11.708
{\an8}Didn't you always want to join
a big maternal and child goods brand?

168
00:11:11.791 --> 00:11:12.916
I can help you with that.

169
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.875
Don't you know?
I've waited for over two months.

170
00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.250
-I can't wait any longer.
-Get out.

171
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:19.791
It's your turn to shower.

172
00:11:23.041 --> 00:11:23.916
Laoliu.

173
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.375
Sanmei. you're here.

174
00:11:26.458 --> 00:11:28.166
We just changed the bedsheet

175
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:29.458
and you've messed it all up.

176
00:11:29.541 --> 00:11:30.500
You!

177
00:11:30.583 --> 00:11:31.500
I…

178
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:34.416
Laoliu. let go!

179
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:35.833
Dear wife.

180
00:11:35.916 --> 00:11:37.208
he was the first to get physical.

181
00:11:38.125 --> 00:11:38.958
Release me.

182
00:11:39.041 --> 00:11:40.000
Let him go.

183
00:11:46.541 --> 00:11:47.833
I'm pregnant!

184
00:11:53.875 --> 00:11:54.875
I'm pregnant!

185
00:11:55.625 --> 00:11:56.500
The baby is his.

186
00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.583
I fought him over you.

187
00:12:03.666 --> 00:12:05.500
That's how I went to jail.

188
00:12:06.375 --> 00:12:09.041
I just want to get married. have a child.
a home. and someone to rely on.

189
00:12:09.125 --> 00:12:11.291
-What's wrong with that?
-What makes you think I can't

190
00:12:11.375 --> 00:12:12.625
-give you a home?
-With what?

191
00:12:16.458 --> 00:12:18.291
I just don't see you being mature.

192
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:21.583
I don't see you being a good dad.

193
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:23.833
Sanmei.

194
00:12:23.916 --> 00:12:24.833
you should take

195
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:26.416
this money.

196
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.375
See it as our way of making it up to you.

197
00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.083
{\an8}It was you.

198
00:12:43.166 --> 00:12:44.916
{\an8}You're the last person
who touched my grandma.

199
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.750
{\an8}Where did you take my grandma?

200
00:12:47.458 --> 00:12:48.750
What's wrong with you?

201
00:12:48.833 --> 00:12:50.500
Where did you take my grandma?

202
00:12:50.583 --> 00:12:51.458
-Enough.
-Where is she?

203
00:12:51.541 --> 00:12:53.916
-To the crematorium! Where else?
-Where is my grandma?

204
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.500
What kind of childhood did you have?

205
00:12:55.583 --> 00:12:57.250
The crematorium was my childhood.

206
00:12:57.333 --> 00:12:58.458
-You give me my grandma back!
-It's okay.

207
00:12:58.541 --> 00:13:00.625
I'm really not in the mood for this.
Take her away now.

208
00:13:00.708 --> 00:13:02.875
-Give me my grandma back!
-I have informed her parents.

209
00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.291
-They'll be here soon.
-Let me go.

210
00:13:04.375 --> 00:13:05.833
I'll play a cartoon for you. okay?

211
00:13:05.916 --> 00:13:07.375
How about an ice cream?

212
00:13:07.458 --> 00:13:09.583
We are so sorry to have bothered you.

213
00:13:09.666 --> 00:13:12.250
Some parents you are.
You let your child loose like this.

214
00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:14.375
-Yes. Xiaowen. let's go.
-I'm not going.

215
00:13:14.458 --> 00:13:15.458
-Come with me.
-I'm not going.

216
00:13:15.541 --> 00:13:17.083
-I'm not.
-What are you doing?

217
00:13:17.166 --> 00:13:19.750
-Xiaowen.
-I'm not going.

218
00:13:19.833 --> 00:13:21.166
Now. Go home.

219
00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:22.125
I'm not!

220
00:13:22.208 --> 00:13:23.458
That's too much.

221
00:13:23.541 --> 00:13:24.750
Come on. Xiaowen.

222
00:13:24.833 --> 00:13:25.958
-Xiaowen.
-I'm not going home!

223
00:13:26.791 --> 00:13:27.791
-Xiaowen!
-I'm not!

224
00:13:27.875 --> 00:13:29.666
-Go home!
-I'm not!

225
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:30.916
-Come on. Let's go.
-I'm not!

226
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.791
Your grandma is in the room.
Go and look for her.

227
00:13:33.333 --> 00:13:34.166
Grandma?

228
00:13:34.875 --> 00:13:35.958
Your grandma is not here.

229
00:13:36.041 --> 00:13:37.208
Let me go!

230
00:13:37.291 --> 00:13:38.500
Let me go!

231
00:13:39.833 --> 00:13:40.708
Stop biting me.

232
00:13:40.791 --> 00:13:41.791
-Stop!
-I'll hit you!

233
00:13:41.875 --> 00:13:43.708
-Stop!
-Stop!

234
00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:46.041
-Let's go.
-Put me down.

235
00:13:46.125 --> 00:13:47.875
Such a biter. You're a dog. aren't you?

236
00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.833
You jerk! I want my grandma back.

237
00:13:50.583 --> 00:13:51.875
Let me go.

238
00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.750
I'm telling you. Let me go.

239
00:13:56.458 --> 00:13:57.875
I see that you own the property now.

240
00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.333
Why don't you transfer
the ownership to me?

241
00:13:59.416 --> 00:14:01.208
We'll join our strengths
in the wedding business.

242
00:14:01.291 --> 00:14:02.666
You'll still be the boss

243
00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:04.041
and I'll give you 15%.

244
00:14:04.125 --> 00:14:06.458
Stop annoying me. will you?

245
00:14:06.541 --> 00:14:08.125
Your family needs to change your ways.

246
00:14:08.208 --> 00:14:09.625
Always dealing with the dead

247
00:14:09.708 --> 00:14:10.625
is bad for feng shui.

248
00:14:10.708 --> 00:14:12.375
Look. Your dad lost a son
in his middle age.

249
00:14:12.458 --> 00:14:14.541
Your sister is married
but spent half her life alone.

250
00:14:14.625 --> 00:14:15.666
Then look at you.

251
00:14:16.291 --> 00:14:17.666
You're in your thirties now.

252
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:20.791
You struggled so much to get a girlfriend
and probably won't even marry her.

253
00:14:20.875 --> 00:14:22.458
What the heck is wrong with you?

254
00:14:22.541 --> 00:14:23.708
Get off.

255
00:14:23.791 --> 00:14:25.375
-It's only a business proposal.
-Get off.

256
00:14:25.458 --> 00:14:28.375
San. it's better to send people
to wedding beds than heaven.

257
00:14:28.458 --> 00:14:29.875
-Be assured. We'll be back again.
-I'll be waiting.

258
00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.583
Fine. Take care.

259
00:14:31.666 --> 00:14:33.833
-Thank you. Bye.
-I'll reserve the wedding gown for you.

260
00:14:34.458 --> 00:14:37.375
-Take care.
-Xiaopang. let's go eat a watermelon.

261
00:14:37.458 --> 00:14:41.000
DAPANG WEDDING SHOP

262
00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.708
<i>Rain shall pour from the sky.
widows shall get remarried.</i>

263
00:14:44.291 --> 00:14:46.125
and you should think about
changing professions.

264
00:14:46.208 --> 00:14:48.041
I'm sick of spending my days like this.

265
00:14:48.583 --> 00:14:49.958
I'm going to change the way I live.

266
00:14:50.041 --> 00:14:52.291
San. I know your mind
is worried about something.

267
00:14:52.375 --> 00:14:53.208
Why don't you tell us

268
00:14:53.291 --> 00:14:54.500
and we'll see how we can help?

269
00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:56.750
What could be bothering my mind?

270
00:14:56.833 --> 00:14:59.416
How about being accused of stealing?

271
00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.125
Getting cheated on by your ex?

272
00:15:01.208 --> 00:15:03.000
And the guy she dumped you for

273
00:15:03.083 --> 00:15:05.041
being richer than you?

274
00:15:05.125 --> 00:15:07.208
Or others saying
that you make a living off the dead?

275
00:15:07.291 --> 00:15:08.791
Or you're inferiority complex

276
00:15:08.875 --> 00:15:10.583
because you've been to prison?

277
00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:13.125
Are you trying to cheer me up
or piss me off?

278
00:15:13.208 --> 00:15:14.875
I'm taking down the shop sign now.

279
00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.166
In short. you have an attitude problem.

280
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.000
No one's history is spotlessly clean.

281
00:15:21.083 --> 00:15:22.500
I was a thief

282
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.458
and she was an illegal street trader.

283
00:15:24.541 --> 00:15:26.208
If you're sickened.
we should just give up our lives.

284
00:15:26.291 --> 00:15:27.541
Then I'll kill myself. are you happy?

285
00:15:27.625 --> 00:15:29.416
Will killing yourself solve your problems?

286
00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:30.958
The reason you find life so hard

287
00:15:31.041 --> 00:15:33.375
is because you constantly
look down on yourself.

288
00:15:33.458 --> 00:15:34.750
-Why are you arguing with me?
-You look down on yourself.

289
00:15:34.833 --> 00:15:36.000
How can others look up to you?

290
00:15:37.916 --> 00:15:39.083
Get up.

291
00:15:40.041 --> 00:15:41.041
Get the hell up.

292
00:15:41.583 --> 00:15:42.750
Get the hell up now.

293
00:15:42.833 --> 00:15:44.416
Give me my grandma back.

294
00:15:53.708 --> 00:15:55.958
-Let me go!
-Get out now!

295
00:15:56.041 --> 00:15:57.416
-Get out!
-Let me go!

296
00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.208
Are you leaving or not? Just go!

297
00:15:59.291 --> 00:16:01.250
I don't have time for this.

298
00:16:04.875 --> 00:16:06.041
She bit me.

299
00:16:07.708 --> 00:16:08.541
Xiaowen.

300
00:16:09.166 --> 00:16:11.833
I will take you to Beijing
to have some fun. okay?

301
00:16:11.916 --> 00:16:13.583
I'm not going anywhere.

302
00:16:13.666 --> 00:16:14.916
I want to find my grandma.

303
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.125
Your grandma is…

304
00:16:21.041 --> 00:16:22.541
What on earth is taking you so long?

305
00:16:22.625 --> 00:16:24.291
We'll miss our flight.

306
00:16:24.375 --> 00:16:25.666
I know.

307
00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:27.250
but what can I do if she won't leave?

308
00:16:27.333 --> 00:16:30.208
Listen. If our son misses anything.
you won't hear the end of it.

309
00:16:30.291 --> 00:16:32.666
-Hurry!
-Stop shouting at me. I'll find a way.

310
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:35.375
Sir. could you please open the trunk?

311
00:16:39.208 --> 00:16:41.125
Sir. do you think this will work?

312
00:16:41.708 --> 00:16:43.958
Can you look after this kid
for three days?

313
00:16:44.041 --> 00:16:45.250
Absolutely not.

314
00:16:45.333 --> 00:16:46.541
This is for the trouble.

315
00:16:47.041 --> 00:16:49.125
Maybe there is a way.

316
00:16:49.208 --> 00:16:51.083
I said no. No way.

317
00:16:51.166 --> 00:16:53.208
This is a graveclothes store.
not an orphanage.

318
00:16:53.291 --> 00:16:56.041
You have no childhood
and there's no empathy in you either.

319
00:16:56.125 --> 00:16:58.250
Are you coming or not?

320
00:16:58.333 --> 00:16:59.583
I'm coming.

321
00:16:59.666 --> 00:17:02.083
-Can't you see? They're in such a hurry.
-Please.

322
00:17:02.166 --> 00:17:04.083
-Xiaowen. be good.
-Hurry up!

323
00:17:04.166 --> 00:17:05.750
-No problem.
-Hurry up.

324
00:17:06.666 --> 00:17:07.541
Take care.

325
00:17:10.041 --> 00:17:11.416
What's the matter with you?

326
00:17:14.083 --> 00:17:15.541
Do you have a problem with money?

327
00:17:16.791 --> 00:17:18.458
Come out now. You can stay here.

328
00:17:18.541 --> 00:17:19.541
Come.

329
00:17:20.166 --> 00:17:22.416
Are you sure
you can handle this little devil?

330
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:25.875
Come on out.

331
00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:27.833
Have a hot shower.
so you don't catch a cold.

332
00:17:28.458 --> 00:17:31.375
It's just three days with a kid.
How hard can it be?

333
00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:38.416
Give me my grandma back.

334
00:17:43.708 --> 00:17:44.625
Eat.

335
00:17:51.916 --> 00:17:53.125
No garlic?

336
00:17:53.208 --> 00:17:54.125
What?

337
00:17:54.208 --> 00:17:56.958
Grandma used to say
a noodle without garlic

338
00:17:57.041 --> 00:17:58.833
tastes only half as good.

339
00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.291
Have you not been eating
in the last few days?

340
00:18:10.375 --> 00:18:12.083
Don't your parents look after you?

341
00:18:13.583 --> 00:18:14.750
I have no mom and dad.

342
00:18:16.041 --> 00:18:17.833
How did you get here anyway?

343
00:18:19.208 --> 00:18:20.333
I took a picture.

344
00:18:20.416 --> 00:18:22.208
showed it to people.

345
00:18:22.291 --> 00:18:24.291
and they showed me the way.

346
00:18:24.375 --> 00:18:25.666
Grandma used to say

347
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:27.625
the road is right under the nose.

348
00:18:29.916 --> 00:18:31.291
Let's play a game.

349
00:18:31.375 --> 00:18:32.833
-Hide and seek.
-I'm not interested.

350
00:18:32.916 --> 00:18:34.708
Then what kind of game
did you play with your grandma?

351
00:18:34.791 --> 00:18:36.041
Mahjong.

352
00:18:39.291 --> 00:18:40.208
Come on.

353
00:18:42.041 --> 00:18:43.333
How big are the bets?

354
00:18:48.541 --> 00:18:50.416
{\an8}You stole your grandma's ring.

355
00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:52.583
{\an8}I didn't steal it.

356
00:18:52.666 --> 00:18:53.625
{\an8}She gave it to me.

357
00:18:54.208 --> 00:18:55.708
{\an8}You mustn't let my uncle know.

358
00:18:59.375 --> 00:19:00.250
{\an8}Put that away.

359
00:19:00.791 --> 00:19:02.208
{\an8}A child shouldn't gamble with money.

360
00:19:03.916 --> 00:19:05.583
TO BRING IN WEALTH AND TREASURE

361
00:19:11.083 --> 00:19:12.125
Four bamboos.

362
00:19:12.208 --> 00:19:13.083
Pong.

363
00:19:14.541 --> 00:19:15.458
East wind.

364
00:19:17.458 --> 00:19:19.875
Are we going to keep playing
this one game until daybreak?

365
00:19:25.958 --> 00:19:26.958
I win.

366
00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:29.291
Same color. three sequences.

367
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.375
Five cracks makes the winning tile.

368
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:33.833
Another game.

369
00:19:33.916 --> 00:19:35.208
My grandma said

370
00:19:35.291 --> 00:19:37.875
quit while you're ahead.

371
00:19:40.583 --> 00:19:41.500
It's bedtime.

372
00:20:14.375 --> 00:20:15.583
Is yours human or goat piss?

373
00:20:15.666 --> 00:20:16.625
It's such a horrible stink.

374
00:20:16.708 --> 00:20:18.416
If you want to wee. go to the toilet.

375
00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:19.375
bathroom.

376
00:20:19.458 --> 00:20:20.500
or restroom.

377
00:20:20.583 --> 00:20:22.750
Your grandma taught you so many things.
Don't you know something so basic?

378
00:20:23.333 --> 00:20:26.166
Why are you shouting at a child
in the middle of the night?

379
00:20:26.791 --> 00:20:28.458
I haven't wet the bed in a long time.

380
00:20:28.958 --> 00:20:30.833
It's just that I'm afraid
to go to your bathroom.

381
00:20:30.916 --> 00:20:32.541
What's so scary about my bathroom?

382
00:20:41.541 --> 00:20:42.875
It's fine.

383
00:20:43.458 --> 00:20:45.000
{\an8}These are all made of paper.

384
00:20:45.083 --> 00:20:46.750
{\an8}Like that ugly tiger of yours.

385
00:20:46.833 --> 00:20:47.750
{\an8}They are all fake.

386
00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:52.250
She has a name. Beans.

387
00:20:52.333 --> 00:20:53.791
My grandma made it.

388
00:20:53.875 --> 00:20:55.208
{\an8}They have names too.

389
00:20:55.291 --> 00:20:57.708
{\an8}The boy is called Cucumber.

390
00:20:57.791 --> 00:20:59.208
{\an8}The girl is called Aubergine.

391
00:20:59.291 --> 00:21:01.208
They are the same. Don't be scared.

392
00:21:01.291 --> 00:21:02.375
Let's go back to bed.

393
00:21:02.458 --> 00:21:03.375
I'm tired.

394
00:21:04.291 --> 00:21:06.125
Let's sleep now.

395
00:21:11.958 --> 00:21:13.291
Where am I supposed to sleep then?

396
00:21:35.791 --> 00:21:36.666
Hello.

397
00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:37.583
<i>Sanmei.</i>

398
00:21:37.666 --> 00:21:39.875
<i>Dad and I are waiting
in the hall for the transfer.</i>

399
00:21:39.958 --> 00:21:41.666
<i>Take the ownership certificate and come.</i>

400
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.458
All the important information
is being washed off.

401
00:22:05.541 --> 00:22:07.333
I'm afraid we can't proceed
with the transfer.

402
00:22:07.416 --> 00:22:09.166
How many days will it take
to get a new one?

403
00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:11.416
First. you need to make
a statement explaining the loss

404
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.083
and it takes at least a month.

405
00:22:15.166 --> 00:22:17.041
There's no need to be
so dogmatic about this.

406
00:22:17.708 --> 00:22:19.625
A dad is giving a house to his son.
Does it need to be this hard?

407
00:22:19.708 --> 00:22:21.541
Why can't you wait a month then?

408
00:22:22.166 --> 00:22:24.375
Are you planning on something?

409
00:22:24.875 --> 00:22:25.750
Relax.

410
00:22:25.833 --> 00:22:27.541
What could I possibly be planning?

411
00:22:27.625 --> 00:22:29.458
Hello. What are you doing at the hospital?

412
00:22:30.041 --> 00:22:31.458
I've been very clear about this.

413
00:22:32.041 --> 00:22:33.875
I'm closing the business. I'm done.

414
00:22:33.958 --> 00:22:35.750
Stop going against
everything I want. will you?

415
00:22:35.833 --> 00:22:37.416
I think it's you who's going against

416
00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:38.833
-me all the time.
-What are you doing?

417
00:22:38.916 --> 00:22:40.791
What are you doing? It hurts.

418
00:22:40.875 --> 00:22:42.500
The house is for you to do business.

419
00:22:42.583 --> 00:22:45.208
Don't you dare close up the shop
without my say-so.

420
00:22:47.291 --> 00:22:48.166
Sanmei.

421
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:50.500
I'm watching you.

422
00:23:06.291 --> 00:23:07.375
Where is my grandma?

423
00:23:11.416 --> 00:23:12.708
You promised me.

424
00:23:12.791 --> 00:23:15.541
When I wake up.
you'd take me to find my grandma.

425
00:23:15.625 --> 00:23:16.750
Liar.

426
00:23:22.625 --> 00:23:23.708
We are the…

427
00:23:23.791 --> 00:23:25.291
I was here first.

428
00:23:25.875 --> 00:23:26.916
My condolences.

429
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.833
You people have been waiting outside
even when my girl is still alive.

430
00:23:32.916 --> 00:23:34.375
The doctor just pronounced her dead

431
00:23:34.458 --> 00:23:36.291
and you're onto me
like crazed. starving dogs.

432
00:23:36.375 --> 00:23:37.958
Do you not have kids of your own?

433
00:23:38.041 --> 00:23:39.416
Build some good karma.

434
00:23:44.291 --> 00:23:45.250
Is it a little girl?

435
00:23:47.375 --> 00:23:48.791
She has been sick for over a year.

436
00:23:48.875 --> 00:23:50.625
She's probably died of heart failure.

437
00:23:54.041 --> 00:23:54.916
Hello.

438
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.791
<i>Listen. The old man
is really fed up this time.</i>

439
00:23:56.875 --> 00:23:58.875
<i>Behave yourself
if you still want the house.</i>

440
00:23:58.958 --> 00:24:01.000
I didn't do it on purpose.

441
00:24:02.208 --> 00:24:03.458
Where is my grandma?

442
00:24:05.375 --> 00:24:07.333
Stop bothering me. will you?

443
00:24:15.458 --> 00:24:16.958
I'll take you to find your grandma

444
00:24:17.041 --> 00:24:18.500
if you listen to what I say.

445
00:24:19.083 --> 00:24:20.333
Do you hear me?

446
00:24:44.041 --> 00:24:45.875
You guys really don't know
when to quit. do you?

447
00:24:47.875 --> 00:24:48.750
Sir.

448
00:24:49.958 --> 00:24:51.916
May I borrow
a minute of your time. please?

449
00:24:55.916 --> 00:24:57.125
I just saw you

450
00:24:57.208 --> 00:24:59.791
over there in the hallway
telling them off.

451
00:25:00.708 --> 00:25:03.583
I want to tell you that I understand.
I really do.

452
00:25:04.625 --> 00:25:06.000
However. there has to be someone

453
00:25:07.083 --> 00:25:09.000
to help you
with the child's funeral arrangements.

454
00:25:10.541 --> 00:25:11.625
At a time like this.

455
00:25:12.208 --> 00:25:13.750
everyone in the family must stay strong.

456
00:25:17.458 --> 00:25:18.541
This is my daughter.

457
00:25:19.541 --> 00:25:21.291
My wife is never happy
with the fact that I'm poor.

458
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.250
so she ran off with a man
who owns a maternal goods store.

459
00:25:24.333 --> 00:25:26.958
So I have to bring my daughter along
when working.

460
00:25:27.041 --> 00:25:29.166
If you think I'm trustworthy.

461
00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:31.375
please allow me to make the arrangements.

462
00:25:31.458 --> 00:25:33.333
I'm not doing this for profit.

463
00:25:33.416 --> 00:25:35.625
It's like what you said.
Good karma for my daughter.

464
00:25:47.416 --> 00:25:50.166
It will be cremated
early tomorrow morning. so it's urgent.

465
00:25:51.666 --> 00:25:53.166
I'm leaving the paperwork to you.

466
00:25:54.333 --> 00:25:55.666
Wait.

467
00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:56.583
What are you doing?

468
00:25:56.666 --> 00:25:59.000
I'm taking a photo of this contract
and sending it to my dad

469
00:25:59.083 --> 00:26:00.750
to cheer him up a little.

470
00:26:08.208 --> 00:26:10.000
QINGTIAN FUNERAL PARLOR

471
00:26:13.916 --> 00:26:15.333
QINGTIAN FUNERAL PARLOR

472
00:26:16.166 --> 00:26:17.250
Go.

473
00:26:27.041 --> 00:26:28.708
Shut up and don't move.

474
00:26:28.791 --> 00:26:29.666
Remember.

475
00:26:45.083 --> 00:26:46.958
FUNERAL

476
00:26:50.541 --> 00:26:52.041
FUNERAL

477
00:26:52.625 --> 00:26:55.291
<i>Your grandma
is in that big box over there.</i>

478
00:26:55.375 --> 00:26:56.958
<i>She's being taken to the crematorium</i>

479
00:26:57.041 --> 00:26:58.291
<i>where she'll be burnt to ash.</i>

480
00:27:09.125 --> 00:27:12.375
Have a safe trip to heaven. Rest in peace.

481
00:27:12.458 --> 00:27:16.750
All attendance.
it's time for the three ceremonial bows.

482
00:27:17.333 --> 00:27:18.541
The first bow.

483
00:27:18.625 --> 00:27:19.958
The second bow.

484
00:27:20.041 --> 00:27:20.958
Rise.

485
00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:23.958
Where is my grandma?

486
00:27:24.583 --> 00:27:26.708
My grandma is inside this big box!

487
00:27:26.791 --> 00:27:28.666
-How come there's a child?
-Isn't she yours?

488
00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:31.083
Did you burn my grandma as well?

489
00:27:31.708 --> 00:27:32.750
Get out.

490
00:27:37.666 --> 00:27:38.708
Give me my grandma back!

491
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.250
Give me my grandma back!

492
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:44.458
Where is my grandma?

493
00:27:45.333 --> 00:27:46.416
Give me my grandma back!

494
00:27:53.916 --> 00:27:55.125
Give me my grandma back!

495
00:27:59.875 --> 00:28:00.708
Of course.

496
00:28:00.791 --> 00:28:01.666
Of course.

497
00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:02.666
Rest assured. sir.

498
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:04.166
I will carry it out to the letter.

499
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:05.875
You two.

500
00:28:05.958 --> 00:28:07.125
remember to…

501
00:28:10.416 --> 00:28:12.500
Remember to pay the fines later.

502
00:28:13.458 --> 00:28:16.333
You brought a child into this place

503
00:28:16.416 --> 00:28:18.458
and let her create a scene
at someone else's funeral.

504
00:28:18.541 --> 00:28:20.916
I don't even know this girl.

505
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.541
She's the daughter of a friend.

506
00:28:22.625 --> 00:28:25.250
Then you're letting your friend down.

507
00:28:25.333 --> 00:28:27.458
You're letting your dad down.

508
00:28:28.041 --> 00:28:29.708
You're letting your sister…

509
00:28:31.041 --> 00:28:32.250
By the way. how is your sister?

510
00:28:32.333 --> 00:28:33.791
Don't mention her. please.

511
00:28:34.458 --> 00:28:36.208
You two divorced. Why bring her up?

512
00:28:36.291 --> 00:28:37.583
It was all because of you.

513
00:28:38.666 --> 00:28:39.625
Pay the fine

514
00:28:39.708 --> 00:28:40.666
or your van

515
00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:42.291
won't be allowed in the funeral parlor.

516
00:28:43.333 --> 00:28:44.333
What now?

517
00:28:47.416 --> 00:28:49.416
Were you sent by god to destroy my life?

518
00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.166
Perhaps you don't think
my life is bad enough.

519
00:28:52.666 --> 00:28:54.416
Go ahead and poke some more.
Stab me to death.

520
00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.291
I don't want to live anymore.
Just stab me.

521
00:28:57.250 --> 00:29:00.916
I thought my grandma was in that big box.

522
00:29:04.083 --> 00:29:04.916
Grandma.

523
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:05.833
It's always her.

524
00:29:05.916 --> 00:29:06.958
Come. Get down.

525
00:29:09.375 --> 00:29:10.208
Do you see

526
00:29:10.291 --> 00:29:11.375
that big chimney over there?

527
00:29:11.458 --> 00:29:13.250
You grandma was burnt.
turned to ash and smoke.

528
00:29:13.333 --> 00:29:15.125
drifted up into the sky. and disappeared.

529
00:29:15.208 --> 00:29:16.250
You won't see her again.

530
00:29:16.333 --> 00:29:17.708
Do you understand?

531
00:29:17.791 --> 00:29:18.916
Do you understand now?

532
00:29:41.625 --> 00:29:43.958
Grandma.

533
00:29:46.791 --> 00:29:49.958
Grandma.

534
00:29:55.958 --> 00:29:57.416
Your grandma is not gone.

535
00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:00.125
She just went to another world.

536
00:30:03.541 --> 00:30:05.958
She was burnt and became ashes.

537
00:30:06.041 --> 00:30:07.625
Even if she's burned to ash.

538
00:30:07.708 --> 00:30:09.125
it's not the same as disappearing.

539
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:11.041
It floats in the sky.

540
00:30:12.291 --> 00:30:13.208
right?

541
00:30:15.916 --> 00:30:16.833
Right?

542
00:30:22.125 --> 00:30:23.166
Yes.

543
00:30:23.958 --> 00:30:25.750
It went up into the sky

544
00:30:26.625 --> 00:30:27.750
and became a star.

545
00:30:27.833 --> 00:30:29.458
She became a star. yes.

546
00:30:29.541 --> 00:30:30.458
San.

547
00:30:31.875 --> 00:30:34.125
This is the stuff you asked for.

548
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:36.375
It's customized. just like you ordered.

549
00:30:36.458 --> 00:30:38.083
See? Hand carving at its finest.

550
00:30:38.625 --> 00:30:39.666
Good. Thank you.

551
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:40.791
I'm leaving then.

552
00:30:41.375 --> 00:30:44.541
Is this girl also going to become ashes?

553
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:46.833
Yes.

554
00:30:47.541 --> 00:30:49.166
She's just like your grandma.

555
00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:51.458
She'll become a star too.

556
00:31:21.458 --> 00:31:23.750
<i>Xiaowen. where have you been again?</i>

557
00:31:28.083 --> 00:31:29.916
<i>Xiaowen. I made you
lotus roots with pork ribs.</i>

558
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.208
<i>It's ready to eat.</i>

559
00:31:32.625 --> 00:31:34.541
YOU UNSENT A MESSAGE

560
00:31:34.625 --> 00:31:35.958
<i>Come home soon.</i>

561
00:31:36.041 --> 00:31:37.583
<i>Be careful on the way.</i>

562
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:42.375
<i>Remember to drink a lot of water
when playing outside.</i>

563
00:31:42.458 --> 00:31:44.208
<i>Stand in the shade while you play.</i>

564
00:31:44.291 --> 00:31:46.541
<i>A girl won't look pretty</i>

565
00:31:46.625 --> 00:31:47.916
<i>with tanned skin.</i>

566
00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:53.333
<i>Baby. I got you a watermelon.
Come back and eat it.</i>

567
00:31:55.291 --> 00:31:57.666
<i>Xiaowen. it's your birthday today.</i>

568
00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:59.875
<i>Don't spend too long playing outside.</i>

569
00:32:01.083 --> 00:32:02.500
<i>Come home soon.</i>

570
00:32:02.583 --> 00:32:05.416
<i>I only asked you to get some garlic.
What took you so long?</i>

571
00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:20.750
What are you doing?

572
00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.375
Why on earth would I
have ever given you credit?

573
00:32:24.458 --> 00:32:25.458
What happened?

574
00:32:25.541 --> 00:32:26.708
What's going on?

575
00:32:28.166 --> 00:32:29.083
What happened?

576
00:32:31.166 --> 00:32:32.791
What did I tell you about her?

577
00:32:32.875 --> 00:32:34.958
This little devil is my archnemesis.

578
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.333
You won't quit until you have me

579
00:32:37.416 --> 00:32:39.291
crushed beneath
the Five Finger Mountain. right?

580
00:32:40.916 --> 00:32:42.500
Are you drawing on a cinerary casket?

581
00:32:42.583 --> 00:32:43.833
What on earth were you thinking?

582
00:32:43.916 --> 00:32:44.875
Say it!

583
00:32:46.166 --> 00:32:47.208
Hello.

584
00:32:47.708 --> 00:32:48.916
The urn I ordered yesterday…

585
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.583
How long will it take to get another one?

586
00:32:51.416 --> 00:32:52.416
Tomorrow morning?

587
00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:55.291
That's no good.
The cremation is at 9 a.m. today.

588
00:33:05.875 --> 00:33:08.333
I came to see you. I'm here.

589
00:33:09.375 --> 00:33:10.833
I'm here.

590
00:33:11.833 --> 00:33:13.250
I failed.

591
00:33:13.333 --> 00:33:15.458
I failed to look after you.

592
00:33:15.541 --> 00:33:18.041
I failed. I'm so sorry.

593
00:33:18.125 --> 00:33:19.666
I can't get rid of the drawing.

594
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:20.625
Dish wash.

595
00:33:20.708 --> 00:33:21.666
disinfectant.

596
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:23.166
gasoline. and alcohol.

597
00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:24.250
We've tried everything.

598
00:33:24.333 --> 00:33:25.875
Maybe we can talk them into

599
00:33:25.958 --> 00:33:26.916
changing it?

600
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.500
Changing what?

601
00:33:28.583 --> 00:33:30.541
They wanted a customized cinerary casket.

602
00:33:30.625 --> 00:33:31.708
not an ashtray.

603
00:33:31.791 --> 00:33:33.041
Then what are we supposed to do?

604
00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:58.750
Open your eyes wide and look carefully.

605
00:33:58.833 --> 00:34:00.958
Watch how I'm getting ruined
because of you.

606
00:34:09.083 --> 00:34:10.416
Sir.

607
00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:11.791
we both have daughters.

608
00:34:12.416 --> 00:34:14.125
Looking at your wife sobbing this hard.

609
00:34:14.208 --> 00:34:15.291
it…

610
00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:18.791
It breaks my heart as well.

611
00:34:24.291 --> 00:34:25.833
My daughter…

612
00:34:26.541 --> 00:34:29.125
She wanted to express her grief
for a fellow child. so…

613
00:34:34.625 --> 00:34:35.708
Just take a look yourselves.

614
00:35:01.833 --> 00:35:03.750
{\an8}We can see that
you put a lot of effort into this.

615
00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:06.083
Our daughter…

616
00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:12.000
{\an8}She loved drawing.

617
00:35:20.208 --> 00:35:21.166
Where is your girl?

618
00:35:21.916 --> 00:35:23.000
My daughter

619
00:35:23.583 --> 00:35:24.541
is over there.

620
00:35:33.416 --> 00:35:34.958
We've been concentrating on our careers

621
00:35:35.708 --> 00:35:36.916
and it wasn't until
after our child fell sick

622
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.916
did we realize
what the most important thing is.

623
00:35:39.708 --> 00:35:40.833
Be with her.

624
00:35:43.583 --> 00:35:44.500
Take this.

625
00:35:45.791 --> 00:35:47.416
No. This won't do.

626
00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:48.333
Sir. this won't do.

627
00:35:48.416 --> 00:35:49.875
-It's for the child.
-This money…

628
00:36:12.291 --> 00:36:14.375
{\an8}UP SKY

629
00:36:18.875 --> 00:36:20.125
Eat. It's all yours.

630
00:36:20.208 --> 00:36:21.666
You even said

631
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:23.500
she's a jinx and nemesis?

632
00:36:23.583 --> 00:36:24.958
I think she's a lucky star.

633
00:36:25.041 --> 00:36:27.208
She's not so annoying

634
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:29.291
when she's not looking for her grandma.

635
00:36:34.833 --> 00:36:36.958
Don't eat stuff
that has fallen on the floor.

636
00:36:37.041 --> 00:36:38.500
There's still a lot left in the bowl.

637
00:36:48.333 --> 00:36:49.333
What is this?

638
00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:53.916
It's not for eating!

639
00:36:54.583 --> 00:36:55.708
-Spit it out!
-Spit it out!

640
00:36:55.791 --> 00:36:56.625
Spit it out!

641
00:36:56.708 --> 00:36:57.916
-Spit it out.
-Open your mouth.

642
00:36:58.833 --> 00:36:59.791
Now.

643
00:36:59.875 --> 00:37:01.125
Where is it?

644
00:37:01.208 --> 00:37:02.375
Did you swallow it?

645
00:37:03.916 --> 00:37:04.958
My grandma said

646
00:37:05.041 --> 00:37:06.583
every grain is the fruit of hard work.

647
00:37:25.083 --> 00:37:26.875
Someone actually took this
for food and ate it?

648
00:37:26.958 --> 00:37:29.083
You are such irresponsible parents.

649
00:37:29.166 --> 00:37:30.666
Can we take it out?

650
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:31.833
Take some medicine first.

651
00:37:31.916 --> 00:37:34.291
eat Chinese chives or bananas.

652
00:37:34.375 --> 00:37:36.666
monitor her bowel movements
in the next two days.

653
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:38.250
and see if it comes out with the feces.

654
00:37:55.125 --> 00:37:56.625
Have you found it yet?

655
00:37:56.708 --> 00:37:57.625
No.

656
00:38:04.208 --> 00:38:05.625
It's your turn now.

657
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.583
She pooped it out.

658
00:38:30.666 --> 00:38:32.375
Well done. Xiaowen.

659
00:38:32.458 --> 00:38:34.291
You pooped it out.

660
00:38:34.375 --> 00:38:35.625
You pooped it out.

661
00:38:40.125 --> 00:38:41.041
Hello?

662
00:38:41.125 --> 00:38:42.416
You're back.

663
00:38:43.375 --> 00:38:44.375
No need.

664
00:38:44.458 --> 00:38:45.708
I'll bring her back.

665
00:38:45.791 --> 00:38:46.666
They're back.

666
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:48.750
Pack up.

667
00:38:50.333 --> 00:38:51.250
Okay.

668
00:38:59.458 --> 00:39:00.791
The whole family went to Beijing for you.

669
00:39:00.875 --> 00:39:03.208
The trip cost me several months' wages.

670
00:39:03.291 --> 00:39:04.416
And look at you.

671
00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:06.208
You got the last place in the competition.

672
00:39:06.291 --> 00:39:07.458
How dare you?

673
00:39:08.125 --> 00:39:10.791
This child is getting ruined
because of you.

674
00:39:10.875 --> 00:39:12.458
I think you've been paying
too much attention

675
00:39:12.541 --> 00:39:13.791
on other people's kids.

676
00:39:16.291 --> 00:39:18.833
We're sorry for troubling you.

677
00:39:18.916 --> 00:39:20.458
Sir. about this receipt from the hospital.

678
00:39:20.541 --> 00:39:22.375
you can transfer the money to me

679
00:39:22.458 --> 00:39:25.333
-via the phone.
-Your mom didn't leave me a single cent.

680
00:39:25.416 --> 00:39:27.333
Why should I raise her up？

681
00:39:27.416 --> 00:39:28.291
If you want to keep her.

682
00:39:28.375 --> 00:39:30.541
I suggest you bring her back
to Sichuan and raise her there.

683
00:39:30.625 --> 00:39:32.916
You want me to look after
both of you and her.

684
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.500
What have I done to deserve this?

685
00:39:34.583 --> 00:39:35.583
Are you kidding me?

686
00:39:35.666 --> 00:39:37.166
It's bad enough you don't earn much.

687
00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:38.416
It's exhausting for me.

688
00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:39.541
Why are you back?

689
00:39:40.875 --> 00:39:41.916
Can you

690
00:39:42.916 --> 00:39:44.083
be nice to the child?

691
00:39:44.166 --> 00:39:45.541
If you want to be nice to her.

692
00:39:45.625 --> 00:39:46.833
keep her.

693
00:39:46.916 --> 00:39:49.166
Go before you mess up our floor.

694
00:39:49.791 --> 00:39:51.000
What are you saying?

695
00:39:51.083 --> 00:39:52.916
-I don't care who you are.
-What did you say?

696
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.166
You're such a jerk.

697
00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:55.416
-Say that again.
-I'll call the cops.

698
00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:56.416
-What did you say?
-Get out of the way.

699
00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:59.333
-I'll give you a good. hard slap.
-You're bad. I want to call the cops.

700
00:39:59.416 --> 00:40:00.291
-Wait.
-Scram.

701
00:40:00.375 --> 00:40:02.250
What an uncivilized creature.

702
00:40:03.333 --> 00:40:05.375
You've already come this far.

703
00:40:05.458 --> 00:40:06.375
how about

704
00:40:06.458 --> 00:40:09.041
you look after Xiaowen
for a few more days?

705
00:40:09.625 --> 00:40:11.125
You've seen what it's like here.

706
00:40:12.041 --> 00:40:14.708
I still need to work
on my wife about this.

707
00:40:15.291 --> 00:40:16.166
Sir.

708
00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:18.250
You really are treating us
like an orphanage.

709
00:40:18.333 --> 00:40:20.666
We sell graveclothes.

710
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:22.541
I'll pay.

711
00:40:23.416 --> 00:40:24.333
Xiaowen.

712
00:40:24.416 --> 00:40:25.708
are you willing

713
00:40:25.791 --> 00:40:27.041
to stay here

714
00:40:27.125 --> 00:40:29.375
or would you go with them?

715
00:40:46.291 --> 00:40:47.916
<i>What on earth
got into your head this time?</i>

716
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.458
Don't you think our last few days
have been exhilarating enough?

717
00:40:50.541 --> 00:40:52.166
So we're keeping her here again. fine.

718
00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:53.833
But why did you refuse to take the money?

719
00:40:53.916 --> 00:40:54.958
You said it yourself.

720
00:40:55.041 --> 00:40:57.541
"She's my archenemy. My nemesis."

721
00:40:57.625 --> 00:40:59.958
Are you the Monkey King?
Changing your form daily?

722
00:41:00.041 --> 00:41:01.750
You're right.

723
00:41:01.833 --> 00:41:03.833
I am the Monkey King

724
00:41:03.916 --> 00:41:06.791
and I don't like seeing
those devils bully her.

725
00:41:16.791 --> 00:41:18.041
What are you doing here?

726
00:41:20.541 --> 00:41:22.625
What's going on? What's wrong with you?

727
00:41:22.708 --> 00:41:24.541
Your brother-in-law said
you were with a child

728
00:41:24.625 --> 00:41:26.291
and made a whole mess at the parlor.

729
00:41:27.083 --> 00:41:29.333
That stammerer is also a snitch.

730
00:41:29.416 --> 00:41:31.458
-You've learned to swear?
-Dad…

731
00:41:31.541 --> 00:41:33.000
I'm going to teach you a good lesson

732
00:41:33.083 --> 00:41:34.708
-in front of the crowd here.
-Do it then.

733
00:41:34.791 --> 00:41:35.833
Hit me.

734
00:41:35.916 --> 00:41:37.458
-Hit me here. Do it.
-I…

735
00:41:37.541 --> 00:41:38.708
You can't hit San.

736
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.500
This is the child.

737
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.458
Hurry and send her back.

738
00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:54.291
The crematorium is no place for a kid.

739
00:41:54.375 --> 00:41:55.541
When I was her age.

740
00:41:55.625 --> 00:41:57.583
you'd already taught me
how to dress up the dead.

741
00:41:57.666 --> 00:41:58.916
Nonsense.

742
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.083
Don't forget your trial period isn't over.

743
00:42:01.166 --> 00:42:02.375
If you still want the house…

744
00:42:02.458 --> 00:42:03.625
Fine.

745
00:42:03.708 --> 00:42:06.291
He has been threatening me
with this stupid house for over a year.

746
00:42:06.375 --> 00:42:07.833
He never wanted to give it to me.

747
00:42:07.916 --> 00:42:08.833
You shut up.

748
00:42:10.583 --> 00:42:11.750
How about this?

749
00:42:11.833 --> 00:42:13.708
I will buy this house from you.

750
00:42:13.791 --> 00:42:15.125
You can't afford it.

751
00:42:15.208 --> 00:42:16.500
Give me a quote.

752
00:42:16.583 --> 00:42:17.958
Three hundred thousand yuan?

753
00:42:18.041 --> 00:42:19.375
Five hundred thousand yuan?

754
00:42:19.458 --> 00:42:21.666
-A million?
-Sanmei. are you crazy?

755
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:22.875
Three hundred thousand yuan

756
00:42:22.958 --> 00:42:24.666
in 30 days

757
00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:27.750
or get out of my house.

758
00:42:27.833 --> 00:42:28.875
Sir.

759
00:42:30.583 --> 00:42:31.416
Sir.

760
00:42:34.416 --> 00:42:36.250
There's a child to look after

761
00:42:36.333 --> 00:42:38.375
and a house to buy.

762
00:42:38.458 --> 00:42:41.291
I'm definitely
going to have insomnia tonight.

763
00:43:17.708 --> 00:43:19.333
{\an8}WE ARE GETTING MARRIED

764
00:43:33.083 --> 00:43:35.041
Tell me your cell phone number.

765
00:43:35.625 --> 00:43:37.583
Stop bothering me.

766
00:43:37.666 --> 00:43:39.375
Just tell me.

767
00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:45.666
1738

768
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:47.791
6037884.

769
00:44:02.791 --> 00:44:05.083
You're crushed beneath
the Five Finger Mountain for real.

770
00:44:10.375 --> 00:44:13.291
I wouldn't have been crushed
beneath the mountain

771
00:44:13.375 --> 00:44:15.750
if you hadn't done what you did
at the funeral parlor.

772
00:44:15.833 --> 00:44:17.958
If I'm stuck underneath the mountain.

773
00:44:18.583 --> 00:44:20.500
you won't get any closer
to finding your grandma.

774
00:44:32.291 --> 00:44:34.458
Do you have a hole in your jaw
where food leaks out?

775
00:44:36.666 --> 00:44:38.458
It has fallen out. Don't eat it.

776
00:44:39.833 --> 00:44:42.791
It's less than three seconds.
so it's still safe to eat.

777
00:44:42.875 --> 00:44:44.416
My grandma told me that.

778
00:44:45.833 --> 00:44:47.833
I'm going to have to lay
some ground rules here.

779
00:44:47.916 --> 00:44:48.791
First.

780
00:44:48.875 --> 00:44:52.458
chew and swallow slowly when eating.

781
00:44:52.541 --> 00:44:53.375
Second.

782
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.333
food on the ground is dirty.
so don't eat it.

783
00:44:57.416 --> 00:44:59.291
Not exactly clean

784
00:44:59.375 --> 00:45:00.666
but won't exactly get sick.

785
00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:02.000
My grandma told me that.

786
00:45:02.083 --> 00:45:03.000
Third.

787
00:45:03.083 --> 00:45:04.958
stop mentioning your grandma.

788
00:45:05.041 --> 00:45:07.291
Forget about her from today.

789
00:45:08.333 --> 00:45:09.416
Fourth.

790
00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:11.041
no biting people.

791
00:45:17.041 --> 00:45:18.791
So jumpy.

792
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:21.583
Where are you going?

793
00:45:21.666 --> 00:45:23.666
I'm having a shit!

794
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:24.625
Fifth.

795
00:45:24.708 --> 00:45:26.708
stop talking like that!

796
00:45:26.791 --> 00:45:28.291
-Goodbye.
-Take care.

797
00:45:28.375 --> 00:45:30.083
Three hundred thousand yuan in one month.

798
00:45:30.166 --> 00:45:32.541
Why don't we just give up
like what you suggested?

799
00:45:32.625 --> 00:45:34.791
I got us into this. I'll handle it myself.

800
00:45:34.875 --> 00:45:36.791
Your handling caused this.

801
00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:39.833
Why did you have
to fight your dad like that?

802
00:45:40.791 --> 00:45:42.500
He didn't like seeing you with Xiaowen.

803
00:45:42.583 --> 00:45:44.250
so just send her back home for a while.

804
00:45:44.333 --> 00:45:45.541
wait until he calms down a bit.

805
00:45:45.625 --> 00:45:46.750
and that will be it.

806
00:45:46.833 --> 00:45:49.000
Kowtow. apologize. and the case is closed.

807
00:45:49.083 --> 00:45:51.125
If he won't allow me to have her.
the more I'll do it.

808
00:45:51.208 --> 00:45:52.833
I'll look after her
so that he can watch me do it.

809
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:54.583
Xiaowen.

810
00:45:56.833 --> 00:45:57.666
Xiaowen.

811
00:46:01.833 --> 00:46:03.458
XIAONEZHA

812
00:46:04.708 --> 00:46:05.583
Hello?

813
00:46:06.083 --> 00:46:07.291
<i>San.</i>

814
00:46:07.375 --> 00:46:09.083
<i>come to the park.</i>

815
00:46:10.708 --> 00:46:12.416
This is Mr. Liu.

816
00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:14.333
He used to dance with my grandma.

817
00:46:14.416 --> 00:46:15.791
This is San.

818
00:46:15.875 --> 00:46:19.333
He's the one that turned
my grandma into a star.

819
00:46:20.166 --> 00:46:21.791
I'll let you two talk.

820
00:46:22.416 --> 00:46:24.208
I want to hold a funeral.

821
00:46:24.833 --> 00:46:25.708
For whom?

822
00:46:25.791 --> 00:46:26.750
For myself.

823
00:46:29.666 --> 00:46:30.500
Sir.

824
00:46:30.583 --> 00:46:32.625
A little girl can be excused
for being a child.

825
00:46:32.708 --> 00:46:34.833
With your age.
you shouldn't talk nonsense.

826
00:46:34.916 --> 00:46:36.416
What is your problem?

827
00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:37.500
Let's go.

828
00:46:37.583 --> 00:46:40.166
Talk with him a little more. San.

829
00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:41.625
Don't grab me like that.

830
00:46:41.708 --> 00:46:44.833
I don't really have much to live for.

831
00:46:44.916 --> 00:46:47.000
so I just want to see my funeral
with my own eyes.

832
00:46:47.083 --> 00:46:49.083
I'll pay if that's what
you're worried about.

833
00:46:49.166 --> 00:46:50.625
How much can you pay?

834
00:46:50.708 --> 00:46:52.625
How much can a funeral cost?

835
00:46:52.708 --> 00:46:54.958
Well. that depends
on the type of funeral you want.

836
00:46:55.041 --> 00:46:57.458
In ancient times. when a poor person dies.

837
00:46:57.541 --> 00:46:59.000
you just pack him up
in a bamboo sleeping mat.

838
00:46:59.083 --> 00:47:00.208
But when an emperor dies.

839
00:47:00.291 --> 00:47:02.208
the entire nation mourns with their tears

840
00:47:02.291 --> 00:47:04.458
and it might even cost
half the gold in the treasury.

841
00:47:04.541 --> 00:47:06.500
Then I think I'll have
the emperor's funeral.

842
00:47:06.583 --> 00:47:07.958
Are you crazy?

843
00:47:08.041 --> 00:47:09.583
I will pay you 300.000.

844
00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:13.208
If you guys can do it.

845
00:47:13.291 --> 00:47:15.083
I'll put the deposit down right away.

846
00:47:18.041 --> 00:47:18.958
Of course we can.

847
00:47:19.791 --> 00:47:20.791
Deal.

848
00:47:21.333 --> 00:47:22.291
Deal.

849
00:47:23.875 --> 00:47:24.791
Cheers.

850
00:47:25.791 --> 00:47:27.250
Cheers.

851
00:47:27.333 --> 00:47:28.541
It's a success.

852
00:47:31.375 --> 00:47:35.041
So it has come full circle.

853
00:47:35.125 --> 00:47:36.958
Our Xiaowen may have done something wrong

854
00:47:37.041 --> 00:47:38.666
and got us into trouble
in the first place.

855
00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:41.083
but in the blink of an eye.
she has made up for it.

856
00:47:42.416 --> 00:47:44.875
I think we should probably
think more carefully about this.

857
00:47:44.958 --> 00:47:46.708
Why would anyone
want to spend so much money

858
00:47:46.791 --> 00:47:48.958
to hold such a ridiculous funeral
for oneself?

859
00:47:49.041 --> 00:47:52.041
There are all kinds of birds
in a big forest.

860
00:47:53.625 --> 00:47:54.500
<i>Costume.</i>

861
00:47:54.583 --> 00:47:55.500
<i>Setting.</i>

862
00:47:55.583 --> 00:47:58.208
<i>Baixue. look for it
at your theater company.</i>

863
00:47:58.291 --> 00:47:59.125
<i>Jianren.</i>

864
00:47:59.208 --> 00:48:01.541
I'll leave you to find the extras.

865
00:48:01.625 --> 00:48:03.708
Don't miss this!
Placements for a period production.

866
00:48:03.791 --> 00:48:05.000
It's paid work.

867
00:48:07.083 --> 00:48:08.916
<i>Our general principle is</i>

868
00:48:09.416 --> 00:48:11.416
<i>to save every penny we can.</i>

869
00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:12.750
<i>-Come on.
-Let's drink.</i>

870
00:48:21.791 --> 00:48:23.208
It's 100 yuan for a day's work. sir.

871
00:48:23.291 --> 00:48:24.208
It's 100 yuan.

872
00:48:25.833 --> 00:48:27.625
Paid work. Have a look.

873
00:48:29.375 --> 00:48:31.583
<i>Xiaowen. I understand you the best.</i>

874
00:48:32.625 --> 00:48:35.916
<i>I didn't have a happy childhood.</i>

875
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.208
Cheers. Empty the cup.

876
00:48:38.291 --> 00:48:39.791
URGENT HIRING FOR A PERIOD PRODUCTION

877
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.250
How much for a day's work?

878
00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:47.875
Tears pour down

879
00:48:48.666 --> 00:48:49.833
from the Heavens.

880
00:48:51.458 --> 00:48:53.166
Mother Earth

881
00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:54.666
wails in lamentation.

882
00:48:55.666 --> 00:48:57.541
The mountains are rocking.

883
00:48:57.625 --> 00:48:58.833
The rivers are shaking.

884
00:48:58.916 --> 00:49:01.125
Dimmed are the sun

885
00:49:01.208 --> 00:49:03.791
and the moon.

886
00:49:04.416 --> 00:49:05.833
And the Emperor

887
00:49:06.458 --> 00:49:09.291
is no more with us.

888
00:49:10.625 --> 00:49:13.083
Play the music!

889
00:49:21.708 --> 00:49:23.708
Can't they cry louder?

890
00:49:24.291 --> 00:49:26.041
Louder.

891
00:49:26.125 --> 00:49:27.625
Cry like you're heartbroken

892
00:49:27.708 --> 00:49:28.708
and look sad.

893
00:49:28.791 --> 00:49:30.833
No tears. no pay.

894
00:49:32.333 --> 00:49:34.458
Louder!

895
00:49:37.208 --> 00:49:38.958
You cry as well.

896
00:49:43.958 --> 00:49:46.125
Your majesty!

897
00:49:47.583 --> 00:49:49.500
Your majesty!

898
00:49:50.125 --> 00:49:51.000
Dad?

899
00:49:51.833 --> 00:49:53.166
I can't believe my eyes.

900
00:49:53.250 --> 00:49:54.958
You bring shame upon our family name.

901
00:49:56.166 --> 00:49:57.375
Which one of you is Mo Sanmei?

902
00:49:57.458 --> 00:49:58.458
Which one?

903
00:49:58.541 --> 00:49:59.708
It's him.

904
00:49:59.791 --> 00:50:00.916
-See?
-Run!

905
00:50:03.375 --> 00:50:06.833
Go get them!

906
00:50:07.833 --> 00:50:09.583
They are here!

907
00:50:11.375 --> 00:50:13.041
Get our money back!

908
00:50:19.958 --> 00:50:22.458
-Go!
-Let me go!

909
00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:26.916
Let me go!

910
00:50:36.625 --> 00:50:39.583
HUAI'AN ROAD POLICE STATION

911
00:50:49.708 --> 00:50:51.333
What are you doing?

912
00:50:51.833 --> 00:50:53.333
My grandma taught me this.

913
00:50:53.416 --> 00:50:55.291
It relieves the pain
and prevents inflammation.

914
00:51:01.958 --> 00:51:03.458
All right.

915
00:51:07.083 --> 00:51:08.500
Put your signatures down.

916
00:51:16.583 --> 00:51:17.583
You can go now.

917
00:51:23.166 --> 00:51:25.416
A moment. please. San.

918
00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:29.291
Do you think that I was being ridiculous?

919
00:51:29.375 --> 00:51:31.166
And that I was out of my mind?

920
00:51:32.375 --> 00:51:33.500
Two years ago.

921
00:51:34.083 --> 00:51:35.500
our old house
got demolished for redevelopment

922
00:51:35.583 --> 00:51:37.458
and we received a compensation package.

923
00:51:37.541 --> 00:51:38.791
Since then.

924
00:51:38.875 --> 00:51:41.625
the family hasn't seen
a single day of peace.

925
00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:43.791
Do you mean

926
00:51:44.666 --> 00:51:46.166
that's why you came up with the idea

927
00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:47.333
to spend all the money?

928
00:51:47.416 --> 00:51:49.291
When Xiaowen came to me that day.

929
00:51:49.375 --> 00:51:53.708
she wanted me to withdraw
her late grandma's money from the bank.

930
00:51:54.875 --> 00:51:57.750
She said that you were in trouble

931
00:51:57.833 --> 00:52:00.666
and she wanted to help you move
the Five Finger Mountain.

932
00:52:02.916 --> 00:52:04.833
<i>Xiaowen told me that</i>

933
00:52:04.916 --> 00:52:06.208
<i>from now on.</i>

934
00:52:06.291 --> 00:52:08.458
<i>she's going to live with you.</i>

935
00:52:09.125 --> 00:52:12.375
<i>I really wanted to help you.</i>

936
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:18.416
<i>Her grandma had a hard life</i>

937
00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:22.416
<i>and didn't have a lot of savings.</i>

938
00:52:24.916 --> 00:52:25.958
<i>Young man.</i>

939
00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:29.416
<i>please be good to Xiaowen.</i>

940
00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:33.041
<i>I thank you on her grandma's behalf.</i>

941
00:52:37.375 --> 00:52:38.458
Don't break things.

942
00:52:38.541 --> 00:52:39.791
Dad.

943
00:52:39.875 --> 00:52:42.250
Dad. please stop breaking things.

944
00:52:42.333 --> 00:52:44.291
I'm going to destroy this place

945
00:52:44.375 --> 00:52:46.041
once and for all today.

946
00:52:46.125 --> 00:52:47.625
I'd rather burn the place down

947
00:52:47.708 --> 00:52:51.000
than see you disgrace it any further.

948
00:52:51.083 --> 00:52:53.250
A funeral for the living?

949
00:52:53.333 --> 00:52:55.250
No one in our industry
has ever done such a thing.

950
00:52:55.333 --> 00:52:57.375
Well. there has to be
a first in everything. right?

951
00:52:57.458 --> 00:52:59.500
So I'm the first.
Now there's an example to follow.

952
00:52:59.583 --> 00:53:00.416
Old man.

953
00:53:01.125 --> 00:53:03.041
I accepted the job. not San.

954
00:53:03.125 --> 00:53:04.833
If you must hit someone. then hit me.

955
00:53:05.708 --> 00:53:06.833
Look at you.

956
00:53:06.916 --> 00:53:08.125
Look at you.

957
00:53:08.208 --> 00:53:11.583
Pack your things and move out
before the month's end.

958
00:53:11.666 --> 00:53:12.583
Sir.

959
00:53:12.666 --> 00:53:13.625
please calm down.

960
00:53:13.708 --> 00:53:14.833
We'll definitely change.

961
00:53:14.916 --> 00:53:16.166
How am I supposed to change?

962
00:53:17.041 --> 00:53:18.625
How do I change? Into what?

963
00:53:19.458 --> 00:53:21.916
No matter what I do.
it's always wrong in his eyes.

964
00:53:23.416 --> 00:53:25.208
When I was a kid.
I wanted to watch cartoons.

965
00:53:25.291 --> 00:53:26.958
I didn't want to follow him to the parlor.

966
00:53:27.041 --> 00:53:27.875
He beat me up for it.

967
00:53:27.958 --> 00:53:29.916
When others mocked me
about how I make money off the dead

968
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.166
and I had a fight with them.

969
00:53:31.250 --> 00:53:32.458
what did he do?

970
00:53:32.541 --> 00:53:33.875
He watched from upstairs.

971
00:53:33.958 --> 00:53:35.625
then he turned around and went inside
without doing anything.

972
00:53:35.708 --> 00:53:36.833
Sanmei!

973
00:53:36.916 --> 00:53:38.958
Dad. I just want to ask you one thing.

974
00:53:39.041 --> 00:53:41.291
{\an8}I know you prefer my older brother.

975
00:53:41.375 --> 00:53:43.041
{\an8}He's your favorite son.

976
00:53:43.125 --> 00:53:44.166
{\an8}How about this?

977
00:53:44.250 --> 00:53:46.250
{\an8}You beat me to death
and I'll swap places with him.

978
00:53:46.333 --> 00:53:47.625
{\an8}He'll come back and be with you.

979
00:53:47.708 --> 00:53:48.625
Sanmei!

980
00:54:14.833 --> 00:54:17.166
BUSINESS LICENSE

981
00:54:40.875 --> 00:54:42.125
What are you crying about?

982
00:54:44.208 --> 00:54:47.583
Did I get you in trouble again?

983
00:54:51.916 --> 00:54:52.833
Look.

984
00:54:53.625 --> 00:54:55.875
I fixed your red-tasseled spear.

985
00:55:03.708 --> 00:55:05.125
It's not your fault.

986
00:55:06.916 --> 00:55:08.125
It's my fault.

987
00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:10.416
I don't have what it takes to make it.

988
00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:13.666
It's all right. Stop crying.

989
00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:14.916
Sleep now.

990
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.666
After you fall asleep.

991
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.458
the star in the sky

992
00:55:20.291 --> 00:55:22.250
will come down and appear in your dreams

993
00:55:22.833 --> 00:55:24.208
as your grandma

994
00:55:24.291 --> 00:55:25.333
and chat with you.

995
00:55:26.083 --> 00:55:27.291
Really?

996
00:55:27.375 --> 00:55:28.791
Try it.

997
00:55:29.875 --> 00:55:32.125
My watch is broken.

998
00:55:32.208 --> 00:55:34.333
Can you fix it for me?

999
00:55:38.125 --> 00:55:39.583
No problem.

1000
00:55:39.666 --> 00:55:41.375
Can I borrow your pen?

1001
00:55:49.791 --> 00:55:50.833
Give me your hand.

1002
00:56:20.541 --> 00:56:21.666
All right.

1003
00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:24.166
Wear this watch
for a few days as a replacement.

1004
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:25.125
Sleep now.

1005
00:56:41.583 --> 00:56:44.291
We don't play with the uncultured. son.

1006
00:56:44.375 --> 00:56:46.791
Come. let's recite a Tang poem.

1007
00:56:46.875 --> 00:56:47.791
"On the Stork Tower"

1008
00:56:48.375 --> 00:56:49.875
by Wang Zhihuan. Tang Dynasty.

1009
00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:53.458
<i>The sun beyond the mountain glows</i>

1010
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.708
<i>The Yellow River seaward flows</i>

1011
00:56:56.791 --> 00:56:57.875
Louder.

1012
00:56:57.958 --> 00:57:00.583
<i>You can enjoy a grander sight</i>

1013
00:57:00.666 --> 00:57:03.333
<i>By climbing to a greater height</i>

1014
00:57:03.958 --> 00:57:05.875
Come. Xiaowen.

1015
00:57:07.375 --> 00:57:08.416
It's time to eat.

1016
00:57:17.541 --> 00:57:19.791
It's time for her to go to school.

1017
00:57:19.875 --> 00:57:21.375
I should be paying the fees.

1018
00:57:21.458 --> 00:57:22.583
You see.

1019
00:57:23.416 --> 00:57:24.875
This is my sister's

1020
00:57:25.833 --> 00:57:27.166
and this is my mom's.

1021
00:57:28.125 --> 00:57:29.541
Xiaowen is such a poor child.

1022
00:57:30.208 --> 00:57:32.625
It's all because
of my sister's bad relationships.

1023
00:57:32.708 --> 00:57:35.958
We still don't know who the dad is.

1024
00:57:36.041 --> 00:57:37.250
My sister is dead

1025
00:57:37.333 --> 00:57:39.041
and so is my mom.

1026
00:57:39.125 --> 00:57:40.833
I should be the one raising her.

1027
00:57:41.708 --> 00:57:43.333
But look at me.

1028
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.458
no one listens to me in my own house.

1029
00:57:46.541 --> 00:57:48.125
Enough.

1030
00:57:48.208 --> 00:57:50.500
A grown man shouldn't cry like a baby.

1031
00:57:51.541 --> 00:57:53.208
Just tell me what you want.

1032
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.583
Why don't you just adopt her?

1033
00:57:59.416 --> 00:58:01.375
<i>According to Article 9
of the Adoption Law.</i>

1034
00:58:01.458 --> 00:58:03.666
in the case of single males
attempting to adopt females.

1035
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:05.958
there should be an age gap
between the two parties

1036
00:58:06.041 --> 00:58:07.416
of at least 40 years.

1037
00:58:09.708 --> 00:58:10.916
What does that mean?

1038
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.708
He's unmarried.
therefore ineligible for adoption.

1039
00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:29.625
San. why are you here?

1040
00:58:29.708 --> 00:58:31.375
I've brought some late-night snacks.

1041
00:58:32.833 --> 00:58:33.750
Here.

1042
00:58:41.041 --> 00:58:42.708
I want to adopt Xiaowen.

1043
00:58:42.791 --> 00:58:43.875
That's great.

1044
00:58:43.958 --> 00:58:45.458
But the Civil Affairs Bureau says that

1045
00:58:45.541 --> 00:58:47.000
since I'm unmarried.

1046
00:58:47.083 --> 00:58:48.208
I can't adopt her.

1047
00:58:49.083 --> 00:58:50.958
I can smell perfume on you.

1048
00:58:54.291 --> 00:58:55.416
Is it obvious?

1049
00:58:58.125 --> 00:59:00.000
-So perhaps we should…
-You can wash up now.

1050
00:59:04.708 --> 00:59:05.875
When did you get here?

1051
00:59:05.958 --> 00:59:08.041
Well. since you've seen us together now.
there's no need to hide anymore.

1052
00:59:08.125 --> 00:59:09.416
We got the marriage certificate.

1053
00:59:30.583 --> 00:59:32.250
From now on. we're family. Xiaowen.

1054
00:59:32.333 --> 00:59:34.000
Right. hold it up.

1055
00:59:34.083 --> 00:59:34.958
Take a picture.

1056
00:59:35.041 --> 00:59:35.875
Come on.

1057
00:59:36.875 --> 00:59:38.000
One. two.

1058
00:59:38.083 --> 00:59:39.250
three.

1059
00:59:50.416 --> 00:59:52.458
Here. sign it.

1060
00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:58.166
-I'm not going in!
-Be a good kid. Xiaowen.

1061
00:59:58.250 --> 01:00:00.541
-Listen. kindergarten is fun.
-I'm not going!

1062
01:00:00.625 --> 01:00:01.541
-School is no fun!
-Let go.

1063
01:00:01.625 --> 01:00:02.666
-You let go first.
-You let go!

1064
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:04.500
-You first!
-Fine. I'm letting you go.

1065
01:00:08.250 --> 01:00:09.750
Well. I guess it can't be helped.

1066
01:00:09.833 --> 01:00:11.000
I never went to kindergarten.

1067
01:00:11.083 --> 01:00:12.500
-Bye.
-Isn't that so?

1068
01:00:14.583 --> 01:00:16.958
Fine. if we're not going.
then we're not going.

1069
01:00:17.041 --> 01:00:17.875
Come on.

1070
01:00:17.958 --> 01:00:19.708
-Let's go home and play mahjong.
-Let's go.

1071
01:00:23.291 --> 01:00:25.666
I'm not going in!

1072
01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:27.333
Let me go! I'm not going in!

1073
01:00:27.416 --> 01:00:29.250
Look. It's pretty messed up in there.

1074
01:00:29.833 --> 01:00:31.083
Normally. we couldn't fix it.

1075
01:00:31.166 --> 01:00:32.541
You're better off with a new one.

1076
01:00:36.833 --> 01:00:38.458
This property benefits greatly

1077
01:00:38.541 --> 01:00:40.833
from excellent lighting conditions
and soundproofing.

1078
01:00:41.916 --> 01:00:43.041
Take a look at this bed

1079
01:00:43.125 --> 01:00:44.291
and this desk.

1080
01:00:44.375 --> 01:00:46.041
they are ready for use.

1081
01:00:46.125 --> 01:00:47.958
Later. after your child
finishes school day.

1082
01:00:48.041 --> 01:00:49.041
bring her here.

1083
01:00:49.125 --> 01:00:50.458
I guarantee she'll like it.

1084
01:00:51.541 --> 01:00:52.750
JUNE 28TH. MONDAY

1085
01:00:52.833 --> 01:00:54.000
I'll call you back.

1086
01:00:54.083 --> 01:00:56.083
Don't worry. He's coming soon.

1087
01:01:04.958 --> 01:01:05.916
The latest model.

1088
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.041
Try it on.

1089
01:01:08.125 --> 01:01:10.375
Does it have my grandma's voice?

1090
01:01:11.958 --> 01:01:13.166
Your grandma's voice

1091
01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:14.916
was in the old watch.

1092
01:01:16.375 --> 01:01:19.250
Can't the old watch be fixed?

1093
01:01:20.791 --> 01:01:24.833
I will never hear
my grandma's voice again. will I?

1094
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:28.000
That's nonsense.

1095
01:01:29.625 --> 01:01:30.750
Tell me. Who am I?

1096
01:01:30.833 --> 01:01:32.416
You're the Monkey King.

1097
01:01:32.958 --> 01:01:34.291
That's right.

1098
01:01:34.375 --> 01:01:35.541
I cast a spell

1099
01:01:35.625 --> 01:01:37.791
and your grandma's voice
will magically come back.

1100
01:01:41.625 --> 01:01:42.583
Keep drawing.

1101
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.333
WORK NOTES

1102
01:01:55.416 --> 01:01:57.583
SEVERE JOINT PAIN…

1103
01:02:07.958 --> 01:02:09.333
What are you doing here?

1104
01:02:09.416 --> 01:02:11.625
Laoliu is gone.

1105
01:02:11.708 --> 01:02:13.333
He's gone? Go find him then.

1106
01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:19.125
He crashed into a ten-wheeler truck.

1107
01:02:19.208 --> 01:02:21.875
Both he and his car got mashed together.

1108
01:02:21.958 --> 01:02:24.041
Since he was drunk
and on the wrong side of the road.

1109
01:02:24.708 --> 01:02:26.416
it was entirely his fault
and responsibility.

1110
01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:28.333
So I had to sell the store
to pay compensation.

1111
01:02:28.416 --> 01:02:30.708
I have no money now.

1112
01:02:31.958 --> 01:02:33.458
His family wants to pay last respects.

1113
01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:34.750
but I don't think they can

1114
01:02:34.833 --> 01:02:35.750
because…

1115
01:02:35.833 --> 01:02:37.625
Because his body was crushed so badly.

1116
01:02:37.708 --> 01:02:40.000
It was horribly disfigured.

1117
01:02:42.958 --> 01:02:45.125
Repairing his appearance at the parlor
is too expensive.

1118
01:02:45.208 --> 01:02:46.333
You're in this line of work.

1119
01:02:46.416 --> 01:02:47.958
What line of work do you think I'm in?

1120
01:02:50.291 --> 01:02:52.000
-Sanmei.
-Get off me.

1121
01:02:52.083 --> 01:02:53.291
Please help me.

1122
01:02:53.375 --> 01:02:54.875
Stop calling me Sanmei.

1123
01:02:54.958 --> 01:02:57.000
I hate people calling me
by my full first name.

1124
01:02:57.083 --> 01:02:58.166
And I'm very busy now.

1125
01:02:58.250 --> 01:03:00.875
I don't have the time
to argue with you. Just leave.

1126
01:03:10.791 --> 01:03:11.916
Wait.

1127
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.875
I know who you are.

1128
01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:17.041
Don't say that.

1129
01:03:19.875 --> 01:03:22.375
You're the one on San's cell phone.

1130
01:03:23.208 --> 01:03:26.291
Whenever he looks at your picture.
he would cry.

1131
01:03:26.375 --> 01:03:27.416
Don't say things like that.

1132
01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:38.541
Why are you still here?

1133
01:03:39.291 --> 01:03:41.416
With our relationship. I was in the wrong.

1134
01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:43.708
I admit it. We hurt you.

1135
01:03:43.791 --> 01:03:45.125
No. you didn't.

1136
01:03:45.625 --> 01:03:47.041
I was over you a long while ago.

1137
01:03:47.125 --> 01:03:47.958
Go.

1138
01:03:49.208 --> 01:03:51.041
On behalf of Laoliu. I apologize.

1139
01:03:51.125 --> 01:03:52.166
San.

1140
01:03:52.666 --> 01:03:54.041
I'm sorry.

1141
01:04:02.125 --> 01:04:03.166
Get up.

1142
01:04:03.250 --> 01:04:04.583
It's not good for the baby.

1143
01:04:04.666 --> 01:04:06.875
Then will you help?

1144
01:04:11.083 --> 01:04:12.958
This job is not something I can do.

1145
01:04:13.041 --> 01:04:14.375
My dad can.

1146
01:04:15.333 --> 01:04:16.791
but we're not on speaking terms lately.

1147
01:04:16.875 --> 01:04:18.166
I'll go.

1148
01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:22.083
I'm not afraid of him.

1149
01:04:37.458 --> 01:04:38.708
Old man.

1150
01:04:41.875 --> 01:04:43.750
San wants to tell you something.

1151
01:04:43.833 --> 01:04:45.958
but please don't scold him.

1152
01:04:50.541 --> 01:04:53.541
Why should I listen to you then?

1153
01:04:54.833 --> 01:04:56.875
You have to.

1154
01:04:58.583 --> 01:04:59.666
Then call me grandpa

1155
01:04:59.750 --> 01:05:00.958
and I'll listen to you.

1156
01:05:01.041 --> 01:05:02.875
Grandpa.

1157
01:05:02.958 --> 01:05:04.125
Louder.

1158
01:05:04.208 --> 01:05:05.333
Grandpa!

1159
01:05:07.083 --> 01:05:08.958
My granddaughter wants me for something.

1160
01:05:09.041 --> 01:05:10.291
You guys carry on.

1161
01:05:10.375 --> 01:05:11.375
Let's go then.

1162
01:05:22.958 --> 01:05:24.208
No arguing.

1163
01:05:24.708 --> 01:05:25.541
Lay it out.

1164
01:05:36.208 --> 01:05:38.750
I don't drink your counterfeit alcohol.

1165
01:05:40.916 --> 01:05:42.291
This is genuine.

1166
01:05:42.375 --> 01:05:44.250
It cost me over 2.000 yuan.

1167
01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:56.416
Don't let your sister know.

1168
01:05:57.708 --> 01:05:59.666
So even you are afraid of someone.

1169
01:06:05.583 --> 01:06:06.750
Tell me then.

1170
01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:09.708
For what business do you seek my help?

1171
01:06:54.125 --> 01:06:55.000
You do it.

1172
01:06:59.041 --> 01:07:00.125
I can't. Dad.

1173
01:07:00.208 --> 01:07:01.208
I can't do this.

1174
01:07:01.291 --> 01:07:02.333
You can do this.

1175
01:07:02.875 --> 01:07:04.875
I taught you when you were little.

1176
01:07:04.958 --> 01:07:06.291
Go and get the tools.

1177
01:07:07.916 --> 01:07:08.833
What's his name…

1178
01:07:08.916 --> 01:07:09.833
Jianren.

1179
01:07:09.916 --> 01:07:11.791
take that graph out.

1180
01:07:19.083 --> 01:07:20.791
First. rebuild the skeleton.

1181
01:07:42.125 --> 01:07:44.166
First. straighten out the tendons.

1182
01:07:44.916 --> 01:07:46.875
Second. put the bones back
where they belong.

1183
01:07:47.375 --> 01:07:51.083
We go backward from toe to head.

1184
01:07:52.625 --> 01:07:53.916
Limbs come first.

1185
01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.666
then the torso.

1186
01:07:56.458 --> 01:07:58.166
The internal organs

1187
01:07:58.250 --> 01:08:00.583
-must be in order.
-Must be in order.

1188
01:08:00.666 --> 01:08:02.583
The face and the skull.

1189
01:08:02.666 --> 01:08:05.000
-Twenty-three pieces in all.
-Twenty-three pieces in all.

1190
01:08:05.083 --> 01:08:07.583
-Brows. eyes. nose. and mouth
-Brows. eyes. nose. and mouth

1191
01:08:07.666 --> 01:08:09.958
-are firmly in the middle.
-are firmly in the middle.

1192
01:08:12.875 --> 01:08:14.250
Stitch up.

1193
01:08:44.750 --> 01:08:45.666
It's done.

1194
01:08:59.041 --> 01:09:01.625
That's my son.

1195
01:09:14.333 --> 01:09:15.958
Dad!

1196
01:09:16.041 --> 01:09:16.875
Sir!

1197
01:09:16.958 --> 01:09:18.541
Dad!

1198
01:09:18.625 --> 01:09:19.458
Sir!

1199
01:09:23.916 --> 01:09:25.583
<i>Why did you let him drink?</i>

1200
01:09:25.666 --> 01:09:27.666
Are you trying to get him killed?

1201
01:09:28.416 --> 01:09:31.000
I've been keeping this
to myself for a long time.

1202
01:09:31.083 --> 01:09:31.958
but all these years.

1203
01:09:32.041 --> 01:09:33.541
when you weren't happy
with how things were going.

1204
01:09:33.625 --> 01:09:35.125
you were blaming Dad for everything.

1205
01:09:35.208 --> 01:09:36.958
You're so selfish.

1206
01:09:39.625 --> 01:09:40.541
Dad.

1207
01:09:42.166 --> 01:09:43.291
You're awake.

1208
01:09:43.375 --> 01:09:45.041
You scared us to death there.

1209
01:09:45.125 --> 01:09:46.583
I'm fine.

1210
01:09:46.666 --> 01:09:48.333
Same old problem.

1211
01:09:54.333 --> 01:09:55.208
Hello?

1212
01:09:57.166 --> 01:09:58.458
Got it.

1213
01:09:58.541 --> 01:10:00.000
What is it?

1214
01:10:00.083 --> 01:10:02.500
Something came up at the kindergarten.

1215
01:10:02.583 --> 01:10:04.416
Well. hurry up then.

1216
01:10:05.375 --> 01:10:07.541
I'll live.

1217
01:10:07.625 --> 01:10:09.250
{\an8}Then I'll come back
as soon as I can. okay?

1218
01:10:12.333 --> 01:10:13.916
Finally.

1219
01:10:15.041 --> 01:10:17.666
he truly cares about something.

1220
01:10:20.125 --> 01:10:21.458
-Thank you. everyone.
-Thank you. everyone.

1221
01:10:21.541 --> 01:10:25.375
WELCOME TO PARTICIPATE
IN PARENT-CHILD CLASS

1222
01:10:25.458 --> 01:10:26.333
Excellent.

1223
01:10:26.416 --> 01:10:27.666
Now. the next item

1224
01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:29.291
is a performance

1225
01:10:29.375 --> 01:10:30.791
by Xiaowen and Xiaopang.

1226
01:10:30.875 --> 01:10:32.750
Let's give them a round of applause.

1227
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.083
He's my son.

1228
01:10:37.375 --> 01:10:38.250
Kneel.

1229
01:10:41.166 --> 01:10:45.375
The filial son breaks the bowl
and Paradise in the West opens its gates.

1230
01:10:45.458 --> 01:10:46.458
Mom!

1231
01:10:46.541 --> 01:10:48.583
Have a safe journey to the next world.

1232
01:10:51.041 --> 01:10:52.416
I…

1233
01:10:56.291 --> 01:10:57.125
On your feet.

1234
01:10:57.208 --> 01:10:59.333
So basically this is what happened.

1235
01:10:59.875 --> 01:11:01.166
This child's problem is merely

1236
01:11:01.250 --> 01:11:02.541
a reflection of a bigger issue.

1237
01:11:02.625 --> 01:11:04.958
There must be a bigger focus
on education from the parents.

1238
01:11:05.041 --> 01:11:06.333
Our parent-child class

1239
01:11:06.416 --> 01:11:08.458
is only once per month.

1240
01:11:08.541 --> 01:11:11.083
Someone has to be here for her
no matter how busy you are.

1241
01:11:11.166 --> 01:11:13.875
{\an8}This is a drawing she made
in the art class yesterday.

1242
01:11:13.958 --> 01:11:14.958
{\an8}Take a look.

1243
01:11:16.541 --> 01:11:18.000
Funeral wreaths and urns.

1244
01:11:18.083 --> 01:11:19.166
The drawing looks

1245
01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:20.708
so scary.

1246
01:11:20.791 --> 01:11:22.416
So I asked her.

1247
01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:24.041
What do your parents do for a living?

1248
01:11:24.125 --> 01:11:25.041
She said.

1249
01:11:25.125 --> 01:11:27.500
"My mom and dad plant stars."

1250
01:11:27.583 --> 01:11:28.625
Plant…

1251
01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:32.125
To be honest.
I had a pretty good guess already.

1252
01:11:32.208 --> 01:11:35.583
So be careful
with your parenting methods. all right?

1253
01:11:42.541 --> 01:11:43.500
Don't hit the child!

1254
01:11:56.291 --> 01:11:57.375
Sorry.

1255
01:11:57.458 --> 01:11:58.666
We apologize.

1256
01:12:11.625 --> 01:12:12.500
<i>It will be</i>

1257
01:12:12.583 --> 01:12:15.125
<i>your brother's death day in a few days.</i>

1258
01:12:15.208 --> 01:12:18.333
Don't forget to burn
some spiritual money for him.

1259
01:12:18.416 --> 01:12:19.416
Dad.

1260
01:12:20.708 --> 01:12:21.791
My older brother

1261
01:12:21.875 --> 01:12:23.583
must have been much better than me. right?

1262
01:12:24.958 --> 01:12:26.333
Every new year.

1263
01:12:26.416 --> 01:12:29.083
after we have kowtowed to our ancestors.

1264
01:12:30.333 --> 01:12:33.750
I would order you to kneel
and do the same for your brother.

1265
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.666
That's why you've always hated him.

1266
01:12:39.166 --> 01:12:42.750
You never really asked me about him.

1267
01:12:45.083 --> 01:12:46.000
Dad.

1268
01:12:46.083 --> 01:12:48.166
It's just a sniff.

1269
01:12:50.291 --> 01:12:51.208
It was

1270
01:12:52.458 --> 01:12:54.625
the summer of 1988.

1271
01:12:56.125 --> 01:12:58.000
I took your brother

1272
01:12:58.791 --> 01:13:01.291
to the Yangtze River to retrieve a body.

1273
01:13:02.166 --> 01:13:04.375
It was a teenage boy

1274
01:13:04.458 --> 01:13:06.416
that sank into the water.

1275
01:13:08.208 --> 01:13:09.833
His mom

1276
01:13:09.916 --> 01:13:12.958
was standing by the river
weeping uncontrollably.

1277
01:13:14.791 --> 01:13:16.041
We went down

1278
01:13:16.125 --> 01:13:18.333
three times

1279
01:13:19.166 --> 01:13:21.250
but couldn't find the boy's body.

1280
01:13:22.541 --> 01:13:25.083
When I finally got out of the water.

1281
01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:27.416
your brother was nowhere to be seen.

1282
01:13:28.666 --> 01:13:30.791
He secretly went
under water again by himself.

1283
01:13:34.416 --> 01:13:36.916
Your brother managed to find
the missing boy.

1284
01:13:37.833 --> 01:13:39.791
The boy's body was retrieved.

1285
01:13:42.083 --> 01:13:43.625
but your brother didn't come up.

1286
01:13:48.250 --> 01:13:50.208
For someone already dead.

1287
01:13:51.125 --> 01:13:54.208
our family lost a living soul.

1288
01:14:01.708 --> 01:14:02.750
Life

1289
01:14:04.583 --> 01:14:06.833
is like a book.

1290
01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:11.583
Each one has to reach
the last page somehow.

1291
01:14:17.875 --> 01:14:19.208
In some books.

1292
01:14:19.833 --> 01:14:21.875
there's a full stop at the very end.

1293
01:14:22.833 --> 01:14:24.458
In others.

1294
01:14:25.416 --> 01:14:27.125
there's only an ellipsis.

1295
01:14:28.583 --> 01:14:29.708
In life.

1296
01:14:30.958 --> 01:14:32.208
nothing is bigger

1297
01:14:33.291 --> 01:14:35.458
than death itself.

1298
01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:42.041
<i>Fame. wealth.</i>

1299
01:14:42.125 --> 01:14:44.583
<i>all smoke and mirrors.</i>

1300
01:14:44.666 --> 01:14:46.833
<i>One who does our line of work for a living</i>

1301
01:14:46.916 --> 01:14:49.916
<i>must have the heart of a saint.</i>

1308
01:15:29.833 --> 01:15:30.666
Thank you.

1309
01:15:31.250 --> 01:15:32.416
Thank you.

1310
01:15:33.916 --> 01:15:35.083
Hello?

1311
01:15:35.708 --> 01:15:36.875
Curly.

1312
01:15:36.958 --> 01:15:37.875
it's me.

1313
01:15:37.958 --> 01:15:38.875
San.

1314
01:15:38.958 --> 01:15:40.125
So this is the situation here.

1315
01:15:40.208 --> 01:15:41.625
There's data on my cell phone
that can't be retrieved now.

1316
01:15:41.708 --> 01:15:43.041

can fix cell phones and smartwatches?

1320
01:16:04.791 --> 01:16:05.958
What?

1321
01:16:06.041 --> 01:16:07.125
He changed jobs?

It's the old man's last day

1324
01:16:13.458 --> 01:16:16.041
Has everyone done their part?

1325
01:16:17.458 --> 01:16:19.750
Has the filial son been keeping vigil?

1326
01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:23.083
Why am I the only one chanting here?

1327
01:16:24.041 --> 01:16:26.333
How about we all make some noise?

1328
01:16:28.916 --> 01:16:29.833
<i>Hey.</i>

1329
01:16:29.916 --> 01:16:31.041
<i>It's me.</i>

1330
01:16:32.125 --> 01:16:32.958
San.

1331
01:16:35.625 --> 01:16:36.708

Does Beans seem a bit different?

1353
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.500
It has ears

1354
01:18:20.583 --> 01:18:22.250
and eyes now.

1355
01:18:22.750 --> 01:18:24.583
The tail is different too.

1356
01:18:25.166 --> 01:18:26.125

01:18:35.250 --> 01:18:36.791

<i>We'll get your favorite

1371
01:19:07.458 --> 01:19:09.583
<i>Xiaowen. it's your birthday today.</i>

1372
01:19:09.666 --> 01:19:12.166
<i>Don't spend too long playing outside.</i>

1373
01:19:13.916 --> 01:19:15.208
<i>I bought you a new dress.</i>

1374
01:19:15.291 --> 01:19:18.458
<i>Come back and try it on. See if it fits.</i>

1375
01:19:19.833 --> 01:19:22.250
<i>Xiaowen. lock the door from the inside</i>

1376
01:19:22.333 --> 01:19:25.625
<i>and don't open it no matter what.</i>

<i>My granddaughter

01:19:48.625 --> 01:19:51.458
-Take another bite.
-Good morning.

1384
01:19:51.541 --> 01:19:53.083
Xiaowen. wait.

1385
01:19:53.166 --> 01:19:54.958
-One moment.
-Your water bottle.

1386
01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:56.833
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

1387
01:19:56.916 --> 01:19:58.458
Don't forget to drink water.

1388
01:20:05.583 --> 01:20:06.958
How come you're here?

1389
01:20:07.041 --> 01:20:09.750
This is my little sister. Haifei.

1390
01:20:09.833 --> 01:20:11.958
She is Xiaowen's biological mom.

1391
01:20:14.166 --> 01:20:15.166
Over here.

1392
01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.958
Didn't you tell me that her mom is dead?

1393
01:20:19.541 --> 01:20:21.375
So the death certificate
you showed me was fake?

1394
01:20:22.041 --> 01:20:22.875
I…

1395
01:20:22.958 --> 01:20:24.541
The certificate is real.

1396
01:20:24.625 --> 01:20:26.750
This is a very complicated situation.

1397
01:20:26.833 --> 01:20:28.041
It's like this…

1398
01:20:29.375 --> 01:20:30.916
Tell him yourself.

1399
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.208
I'm done.

1400
01:20:34.750 --> 01:20:36.208
He's not lying. San.

1401
01:20:38.250 --> 01:20:39.791
Where did you come from?

1402
01:20:40.791 --> 01:20:42.458
Why should I just believe
everything you said

1403
01:20:42.541 --> 01:20:43.833
and do whatever you asked me to?

1404
01:20:46.666 --> 01:20:47.791
Xiaowen

1405
01:20:47.875 --> 01:20:51.083
was born at 9 a.m. on July 6th. 2015.

1406
01:20:51.166 --> 01:20:53.416
The whole birthing process took 27 hours.

1407
01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:56.541
She wouldn't come out no matter what.
so I had to have a C-section in the end.

1408
01:20:56.625 --> 01:20:58.666
There's a diamond-shaped birthmark
on her left foot.

1409
01:20:58.750 --> 01:21:01.333
If you still don't believe me.
we can do a DNA test.

1410
01:21:02.791 --> 01:21:04.708
I'm not letting you do any silly tests.

1411
01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:16.500
Xiaowen.

1412
01:21:18.625 --> 01:21:20.125
Have you ever met your mom?

1413
01:21:20.208 --> 01:21:22.541
I have no mom or dad.

1414
01:21:22.625 --> 01:21:24.208
I jumped out of a crack

1415
01:21:24.291 --> 01:21:25.625
in a stone.

1416
01:22:28.750 --> 01:22:29.708
Sir.

1417
01:22:30.791 --> 01:22:34.500
I've been waiting out here all these days.

1418
01:22:35.375 --> 01:22:37.541
It seems none of us can sleep--

1419
01:22:37.625 --> 01:22:39.250
Where the hell have you been?

1420
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:47.458
Where were you when her grandma died?

1421
01:22:48.208 --> 01:22:50.708
Where were you when she was
causing trouble all over the place?

1422
01:22:51.333 --> 01:22:53.583
Where were you when her aunt
kicked her out of the house?

1423
01:22:54.416 --> 01:22:56.583
Finally. she has a place
she could call home

1424
01:22:56.666 --> 01:22:58.333
and you're trying to take her away?

1425
01:22:59.416 --> 01:23:01.000
Who gave you the right?

1426
01:23:01.958 --> 01:23:04.291
You're right. I deserve so much blame.

1427
01:23:09.083 --> 01:23:10.083
Are you out of your mind?

1428
01:23:10.583 --> 01:23:12.625
I left home when I was a teenager.

1429
01:23:12.708 --> 01:23:15.083
I followed some classmates
and stepped straight into society.

1430
01:23:15.166 --> 01:23:17.458
I didn't achieve anything
and gave birth to a child.

1431
01:23:17.541 --> 01:23:19.416
My boyfriend ran away
when he saw I was pregnant.

1432
01:23:20.291 --> 01:23:22.166
I refused to give up my dreams.
so I went abroad.

1433
01:23:22.250 --> 01:23:24.125
I did something bad
and ended up in prison.

1434
01:23:24.208 --> 01:23:26.750
My mom couldn't contact me.
so I was presumed dead.

1435
01:23:27.791 --> 01:23:29.541
But even in prison.

1436
01:23:29.625 --> 01:23:31.625
I thought about Xiaowen every day.

1437
01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.708
I know I'm a bad mom.

1438
01:23:34.791 --> 01:23:36.208
I've been a terrible mom.

1439
01:23:36.291 --> 01:23:37.416
but…

1440
01:23:38.958 --> 01:23:40.416
But she's still my child.

1441
01:23:42.208 --> 01:23:43.500
I…

1442
01:23:43.583 --> 01:23:45.333
And I'm still her mom.

1443
01:23:46.208 --> 01:23:48.208
She came out of me.

1444
01:23:57.791 --> 01:24:00.458
This is not a decision
I can make it by myself.

1445
01:24:02.166 --> 01:24:05.000
There's also my buddy.
Jianren. and Baixue.

1446
01:24:05.083 --> 01:24:07.000
I can't make their decisions for them.

1447
01:24:08.250 --> 01:24:11.541
Sir.

1448
01:24:12.708 --> 01:24:13.750
Please.

1449
01:24:14.708 --> 01:24:15.916
I beg you.

1450
01:24:16.875 --> 01:24:18.458
Give her back to me.

1451
01:24:25.666 --> 01:24:26.750
Please. I'm begging you.

1452
01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:36.916
How about

1453
01:24:37.666 --> 01:24:40.083
you give me three more days?

1454
01:24:42.083 --> 01:24:43.291
HEARSE FOR RENT

1455
01:24:44.666 --> 01:24:45.833
Look at you. San.

1456
01:24:45.916 --> 01:24:47.791
Now that's a rare sight to behold.

1457
01:24:48.916 --> 01:24:51.083
I learned it from the Internet.

1458
01:24:51.166 --> 01:24:52.416
Try it. I hope it's not too bad.

1459
01:24:59.541 --> 01:25:01.916
Why do you look unhappy?

1460
01:25:03.166 --> 01:25:04.000
What?

1461
01:25:06.333 --> 01:25:07.375
No.

1462
01:25:07.458 --> 01:25:08.791
I don't look unhappy.

1463
01:25:09.375 --> 01:25:11.625
Do you have a hole in your jaw
where food leaks out?

1464
01:25:19.541 --> 01:25:21.041
Your grandma was right.

1465
01:25:21.708 --> 01:25:23.208
Every grain is the fruit of hard work.

1466
01:25:24.916 --> 01:25:27.916
My teacher says there's another
parent-child class tomorrow.

1467
01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.666
A parent needs to be present.

1468
01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:31.250
Which one of you wants to go?

1469
01:25:31.333 --> 01:25:32.625
-I do.
-I do.

1470
01:25:32.708 --> 01:25:34.166
Only one though.

1471
01:25:42.791 --> 01:25:43.833
I'll go.

1472
01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:47.750

-Go!

1475
01:26:19.166 --> 01:26:23.458
-Mom. Dad. thank you for everything.
-Dad. thank you for everything.

1476
01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:27.291
I know

1477
01:26:27.375 --> 01:26:29.166
that you've been lying to me.

1478
01:26:29.708 --> 01:26:32.291
I'll never see my grandma again.

1479
01:26:33.458 --> 01:26:34.625
But

1480
01:26:35.291 --> 01:26:37.041
I'm not afraid anymore

1481
01:26:38.416 --> 01:26:39.625
because

1482
01:26:40.666 --> 01:26:43.125
I have a dad now.

1483
01:27:27.125 --> 01:27:28.500
What is your dad's name?

1484
01:27:28.583 --> 01:27:30.291
Mo Sanmei.

1485
01:27:32.083 --> 01:27:33.250
Where does he live?

1486
01:27:33.333 --> 01:27:35.875
Up Sky. No. 73. Huai'an Road.

1487
01:27:35.958 --> 01:27:37.500
Yuhua District. Yanjiang City.

1488
01:27:38.958 --> 01:27:40.458
What is your dad's cell phone number?

1489
01:27:42.291 --> 01:27:44.625
What are you doing so late at night?

1490
01:27:45.833 --> 01:27:47.750
I'm so sleepy.

1491
01:27:53.625 --> 01:27:54.791
You won't

1492
01:27:57.750 --> 01:27:59.375
forget about me in the future?

1493
01:28:07.541 --> 01:28:09.083
I'll find a small mirror for you.

1494
01:28:47.166 --> 01:28:49.416
{\an8}UP SKY

1495
01:29:19.333 --> 01:29:21.583
These are things that she'd use regularly.

1496
01:29:22.250 --> 01:29:24.500
-Her clothes. her favorite snacks.
-Okay.

1497
01:29:24.583 --> 01:29:25.583
and her school backpack.

1498
01:29:26.250 --> 01:29:27.541
She doesn't like drinking water.

1499
01:29:27.625 --> 01:29:29.333
so you have to make sure
she drinks plenty.

1500
01:29:31.875 --> 01:29:33.500
{\an8}This cloth tiger is called Beans.

1501
01:29:33.583 --> 01:29:36.416
Her grandma sewed it for her.
It's her favorite thing in the world.

1502
01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:39.041
She likes grabbing the arm
of an adult when she sleeps.

1503
01:29:39.125 --> 01:29:40.958
She likes putting her mouth here.

1504
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:43.583
She eats too fast.

1505
01:29:43.666 --> 01:29:45.000
Also. you have to remind her that

1506
01:29:45.083 --> 01:29:46.625
food on the ground shouldn't be eaten.

1507
01:29:46.708 --> 01:29:48.125
I'm warning you.

1508
01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.833
You have to be good to her.

1509
01:29:50.916 --> 01:29:53.416
I've been to prison.
so I don't mind going back again.

1510
01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:07.708
Here's some money.
It's not much. but you should take it.

1511
01:30:07.791 --> 01:30:09.250
-I can't take this.
-Take it.

1512
01:30:09.333 --> 01:30:11.166
-I can't take this.
-Take it! It's not for you.

1513
01:30:11.250 --> 01:30:13.125
-It's for Xiaowen.
-San?

1514
01:30:13.666 --> 01:30:14.875
Where is this?

1515
01:30:16.291 --> 01:30:17.708
Who are you?

1516
01:30:19.208 --> 01:30:22.625
Child. I am your mom.

1517
01:30:22.708 --> 01:30:24.291
-I'm taking you home.
-I don't have a mom.

1518
01:30:24.875 --> 01:30:26.333
-How can that be?
-Xiaowen.

1519
01:30:26.416 --> 01:30:27.791
Xiaowen. listen to me.

1520
01:30:27.875 --> 01:30:29.416
She really is your mom

1521
01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:30.750
and she has come to take you home.

1522
01:30:30.833 --> 01:30:33.541
-I'm not going with her. Let me go!
-Xiaowen.

1523
01:30:33.625 --> 01:30:34.625
Let go!

1524
01:30:34.708 --> 01:30:35.916
-I'm not going with her!
-Be good.

1525
01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.083
-Be good.
-I have no mom. I'm not going with her!

1526
01:30:38.166 --> 01:30:40.333
Please let us go.

1527
01:30:40.416 --> 01:30:41.250
Just let us go.

1528
01:30:41.333 --> 01:30:43.833
I'm not going with her! Let me go!

1529

-Go. Drive!

-I'm not going with her!
-Be good.

-Be good and come home with me.
-San!

Stop hitting and screaming.

Dad!

UP SKY

1543
01:32:23.833 --> 01:32:26.083
You're always so full of yourself.

1544
01:32:27.250 --> 01:32:28.708
Did you ask Xiaowen what she wanted?

1545
01:32:31.375 --> 01:32:32.916
Did you ask us what we wanted?

1546
01:32:34.166 --> 01:32:36.166
Technically. we're her parents!

1547
01:32:37.791 --> 01:32:39.625
She's registered under my household.

1548
01:32:40.625 --> 01:32:42.458
You're so selfish.

1549
01:32:43.708 --> 01:32:45.583
You're so selfish.

1550
01:32:46.416 --> 01:32:47.666
You're so selfish.

1551
01:32:49.916 --> 01:32:51.958
You want to give up the business? Fine!

1552
01:32:52.041 --> 01:32:53.375
Let's do it now!

1553
01:32:53.458 --> 01:32:54.458
Pack our things.

1554
01:32:54.541 --> 01:32:56.125
You are a heartless beast.

1555
01:32:56.833 --> 01:32:58.291
No wonder your dad looks down on you!

1556
01:32:58.916 --> 01:33:00.958
No wonder your girlfriend cheated on you!

1557
01:33:05.875 --> 01:33:07.375
You don't deserve to be called human!

1558
01:33:07.458 --> 01:33:08.583
Bastard.

<i>sooner or later. this day would come.</i>

1563
01:34:01.250 --> 01:34:04.083
<i>so I've prepared a letter for you two.</i>

1564
01:34:06.208 --> 01:34:08.875
<i>You shouldn't feel sad about my passing.</i>

1565
01:34:09.666 --> 01:34:13.166
<i>Everyone has to face this inevitability.</i>

1566

<i>San.</i>

<i>I'll leave

<i>Don't give me that big ceremony crap.</i>

1569
01:34:24.458 --> 01:34:26.375
<i>I've seen enough of that in my lifetime.</i>

1570
01:34:28.541 --> 01:34:31.541
<i>I want to leave this world clean and pure.</i>

1571
01:34:31.625 --> 01:34:33.958
<i>Just like how I came into this world.</i>

<i>I'm watching you.</i>

1575
01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:15.791
<i>I'd like a customized funeral</i>

1576
01:35:15.875 --> 01:35:18.000
<i>that's both dignified and inexpensive.</i>

1577
01:35:19.833 --> 01:35:22.125
<i>Instead of splashing
on a ceremonial casket.</i>

1578
01:35:22.208 --> 01:35:25.833
<i>I'd rather you spend
the money on a family feast.</i>

1579
01:35:25.916 --> 01:35:27.833
<i>After the cremation.</i>

1580
01:35:27.916 --> 01:35:31.041
<i>put me in that can.</i>

<i>And the dispatching of my remains.</i>

1582
01:35:34.791 --> 01:35:36.583
<i>I'll leave that to you.</i>

1583
01:35:36.666 --> 01:35:40.500
<i>Think of this as a test from your dad.</i>

1584
01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:45.000
<i>If you can't think of an answer.</i>

1585
01:35:45.083 --> 01:35:47.500
<i>I'll just stay in the can</i>

1586
01:35:47.583 --> 01:35:48.666

1587
01:36:10.291 --> 01:36:12.208
My sister. how should we do this?

1588
01:36:12.750 --> 01:36:13.791
How should we do what?

1589
01:36:15.125 --> 01:36:17.458
How do we dispatch Dad's remains?

1590
01:36:17.541 --> 01:36:19.458
Buried together with mom's. of course.

1591
01:36:20.125 --> 01:36:23.166
No. Dad was very clear in his will.

1592
01:36:23.250 --> 01:36:25.625
He said he wants a special funeral
that's different.

1593
01:36:25.708 --> 01:36:27.291
Well. how special can a funeral be?

1594
01:36:27.375 --> 01:36:29.125
Where else can we put it
if not underground?

1595
01:36:29.208 --> 01:36:30.500
In the sky?

1596
01:36:36.541 --> 01:36:37.500
