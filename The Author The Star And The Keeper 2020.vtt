00:02:24.318 --> 00:02:25.971
A man could get killed
in this storm.

22
00:02:26.015 --> 00:02:27.103
- Yes. he could.

23
00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:28.844
That's exactly why we're here.

00:02:28.887 --> 00:02:30.802

30
00:02:42.814 --> 00:02:46.818

remind you that our family

that aint gonna happen.

- You don't know what
you're talking about.

37
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.403
- We're here for the tourists.

38
00:03:06.447 --> 00:03:08.666

life used to be.

- Is something wrong. August?

50
00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:43.832
- No. I was just
thinking about--

51
00:03:43.875 --> 00:03:46.748
- Thinking of a way to thank
me for being the only manager

52
00:03:46.791 --> 00:03:49.272
that could get you out of
the national tour of the show

53
00:03:49.316 --> 00:03:51.405
that you made a Broadway hit
to get you to L.A. in time

54
00:03:51.448 --> 00:03:53.015
to star in the movie
based on the show

55
00:03:53.058 --> 00:03:54.277

[August chuckles]

57
00:03:55.757 --> 00:03:57.628
- Rhonda. you read my mind.

58
00:03:57.672 --> 00:03:59.021
- There's no need to thank me.

59
00:03:59.064 --> 00:04:00.283
It's my pleasure.

60
00:04:00.327 --> 00:04:02.807
Besides. the 30%
interest I own in you

61
00:04:02.851 --> 00:04:05.288
is all the thanks I need.

62
00:04:05.332 --> 00:04:07.551
You leave for L.A. tonight.

63
00:04:09.074 --> 00:04:10.032
- Tonight?

64
00:04:10.075 --> 00:04:10.859
Why tonight?

65
00:04:10.902 --> 00:04:12.382
- Why not tonight?

66
00:04:12.426 --> 00:04:15.124
- Rhonda. you know how
I feel about flying.

67
00:04:15.167 --> 00:04:17.344
- Did I mention your
ticket is First Class?

68
00:04:17.387 --> 00:04:19.259
- I just wanted one last night

69
00:04:19.302 --> 00:04:21.696
to celebrate with the cast.

70
00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.264
Give me one good reason why
we need to leave tonight.

71
00:04:24.307 --> 00:04:26.570
- I'll give you three
good reasons.

78
00:04:42.673 --> 00:04:43.935
- Writer?

79
00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.416
I've been doing this role
for seven years.

80
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.897
I can do the part in my sleep.

81
00:04:51.116 --> 00:04:52.901
The fact is. I probably have.

82
00:04:52.944 --> 00:04:56.165
- Exactly why we need to
get out of here.

83
00:04:56.208 --> 00:04:57.645
We need to change.

84
00:04:57.688 --> 00:05:01.736

- What's this for?

110

- Sign the wall.

111
00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:19.248
- Hey. Timmy. move
out of the way.

112

- No.

113

Always reach for the stars.

[gentle music]

116
00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:49.539
- Maybe I should
finish the tour.

117
00:06:49.583 --> 00:06:52.673
- Maybe you should leave
decisions like that to me.

118
00:06:52.716 --> 00:06:54.239
- Really. Rhonda?

119
00:06:54.283 --> 00:06:56.328

You told me I had a month
before the movie started.

Do you know how hard it
was to book you

00:07:48.816 --> 00:07:51.253
You're not exactly a
household name. not yet.

143

- Great. then let's
wait until I am.

145

00:09:12.203 --> 00:09:13.465
- What is this?

186
00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:15.076
- Your scheduled
appearances for the next--

187
00:09:15.119 --> 00:09:15.903
- Two weeks?

188
00:09:15.946 --> 00:09:16.425
- Sh!

189
00:09:17.687 --> 00:09:19.210
- [August] I didn't agree
to any of this.

190
00:09:19.254 --> 00:09:20.429
- Yes. we did.

191
00:09:28.089 --> 00:09:31.048
Remember. what's hot
today can just as easily

192
00:09:31.092 --> 00:09:33.311
become what's not tomorrow.

193
00:09:34.661 --> 00:09:38.099
I'm here to make sure that
doesn't happen.

194
00:09:40.057 --> 00:09:41.015
- If you change your mind.
let me know.

195
00:09:41.058 --> 00:09:42.016
My number's on the bottom.

196
00:09:42.059 --> 00:09:44.409
- [Bobby] Yeah. I will Tony.

197
00:09:44.453 --> 00:09:45.323
- [Woman] One minute August.

198
00:09:45.367 --> 00:09:46.455
- Thanks Kim.

199
00:09:49.632 --> 00:09:51.286
What's that about?

200
00:09:51.329 --> 00:09:52.200
- My cousin.

201
00:09:52.243 --> 00:09:54.942
He moves specialty cars.

202
00:09:54.985 --> 00:09:56.596
I was gonna take next week off

203
00:09:56.639 --> 00:09:58.685
and drive that down to
Vegas to a client of his.

204
00:09:58.728 --> 00:10:00.774
but someone who shall
remain nameless

205
00:10:00.817 --> 00:10:02.297
decided to quit the show.

206
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.038
So I requested to stay here

207
00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:05.692
and help the new guy for
the first week.

208
00:10:05.735 --> 00:10:06.518
- Sorry.

209
00:10:06.562 --> 00:10:07.911
Sweet ride though.

210
00:10:07.955 --> 00:10:09.304
- It is.

211
00:10:09.347 --> 00:10:11.698
And my cousin isn't one
for taking no.

212
00:10:11.741 --> 00:10:12.960
Hey!

213
00:10:13.003 --> 00:10:15.049
Hey kid. you old enough
to go to Vegas?

214
00:10:15.092 --> 00:10:17.312
Forget that. you old
enough to drive?

215
00:10:17.355 --> 00:10:18.443
- 20 seconds.

216
00:10:25.929 --> 00:10:27.061
- Tony!

217
00:10:27.104 --> 00:10:27.888
- Cue in five!

218
00:10:27.931 --> 00:10:28.976
- Okay. okay!

219
00:10:32.022 --> 00:10:32.806

- Waitress.

232
00:12:33.404 --> 00:12:34.841
- Waitress?

233
00:12:34.884 --> 00:12:37.017
It's worse than that. I
own the place.

234
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.192
- Sorry.

235
00:12:38.235 --> 00:12:40.063
- Can I help you?

236
00:12:40.107 --> 00:12:41.848
- Kate is it?

237
00:12:41.891 --> 00:12:43.153
- Great deduction.

238
00:12:43.197 --> 00:12:45.286
- Kate. I'll have a
skinny caramel latte

239
00:12:45.329 --> 00:12:46.809
with two shots of espresso.

240
00:12:46.853 --> 00:12:49.638

- Good morning to you too boss.

246
00:13:08.135 --> 00:13:10.006

was sent to pick you up

247
00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:12.008
at LAX says you weren't
on the plane.

248
00:13:12.052 --> 00:13:13.183

00:13:13.227 --> 00:13:14.619
Well. didn't I tell you?

00:13:17.144 --> 00:13:18.449

Okay. I knew he would
be messed up in this.

263
00:13:38.426 --> 00:13:39.688
What about the Parsons show?

264
00:13:39.731 --> 00:13:41.603

270
00:13:50.873 --> 00:13:51.743
I think it's a bad connection.

271
00:13:51.787 --> 00:13:52.962
- Don't give me that.

272
00:13:53.006 --> 00:13:54.442

perfectly well.

The administrator at the
Owl's Nest Nursing Home.

285
00:14:20.555 --> 00:14:22.252

- Excuse me?

287
00:14:23.123 --> 00:14:24.689

288
00:14:24.733 --> 00:14:25.952
- As a matter of fact. yes.

289
00:14:25.995 --> 00:14:26.778
- How far did he get this time?

290
00:14:26.822 --> 00:14:28.215
- To the harbor.

291
00:14:28.258 --> 00:14:30.173
- You guys really need a
better security system.

292
00:14:30.217 --> 00:14:32.262
- Mr. Star. I'm sorry
to inform you

293
00:14:32.306 --> 00:14:34.221
that there has been a
significant deterioration

294
00:14:34.264 --> 00:14:35.700
in your father's condition.

295
00:14:35.744 --> 00:14:37.398
- Oh.

- It's safe to say that tomorrow
won't be as good as today.

298
00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:43.795
He keeps asking for you.

299
00:14:43.839 --> 00:14:44.884
- For me?

300
00:14:44.927 --> 00:14:46.842
- I'm assuming you're Auggie?

301
00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:48.017
- Used to be.

302
00:14:48.061 --> 00:14:49.366
- If there is any way
you could find

303
00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:51.803
the time to come
visit your father.

304
00:14:51.847 --> 00:14:54.458
I would recommend you do it now.

305
00:14:56.765 --> 00:14:57.592

368
00:18:28.455 --> 00:18:32.241
- Well. for nearly being
run over by a car. not bad.

369
00:18:32.285 --> 00:18:33.460
- You were what?

370
00:18:33.503 --> 00:18:35.984
In seventh grade when
we were seniors?

371
00:18:36.027 --> 00:18:37.942
- Yeah. that sounds about right.

372
00:18:37.986 --> 00:18:40.075
- What's Roger up to these days?

373
00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:42.382
- He owns a marine dealership
down on Sturgeon Bay.

374
00:18:42.425 --> 00:18:43.470
- That figures.

375
00:18:43.513 --> 00:18:46.125
- Well. he always
liked the water.

376
00:18:46.168 --> 00:18:47.778
Not like some people we know.

377
00:18:47.822 --> 00:18:48.518
- Who?

378
00:18:48.562 --> 00:18:50.085
Me?

379
00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:51.956
- Roger said you couldn't
wait to get off Owl's Point.

380
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.567
- Can you blame me?

381
00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:55.090
Other than some summer
stock theater

382
00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:57.353
and the state park.
there isn't much

383
00:18:57.397 --> 00:19:00.269
opportunity for an
actor around here.

384
00:19:00.313 --> 00:19:02.184
- I heard you're making the
jump from stage to screen.

385
00:19:02.228 --> 00:19:03.446
congratulations.

386
00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:04.795
- Thanks.

387
00:19:04.839 --> 00:19:06.797
I'm on my way to L.A. now.

388
00:19:06.841 --> 00:19:08.886
- Owl's Point is sort
of a round about

389
00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:11.802
way to Hollywood.
wouldn't you say?

390
00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.155
It's nice to see you again.

391
00:19:16.198 --> 00:19:17.025
- Wait.

392
00:19:17.895 --> 00:19:19.636
Let my buy you lunch.

393
00:19:20.985 --> 00:19:21.943
- I just ate.

394
00:19:21.986 --> 00:19:23.640
- Okay. coffee than.

395
00:19:24.815 --> 00:19:25.642
I owe you.

396
00:19:28.384 --> 00:19:30.691
- Thanks. but I'm already late

397
00:19:30.734 --> 00:19:32.562
and you are procrastinating.

398
00:19:32.606 --> 00:19:35.130
Auggie. go see your Dad.
[horn honking]

399
00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:37.437
- How do you know I'm
here to see my Dad?

400
00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.265
- I work at the Owl's
Nest Nursing Home.

401
00:19:39.308 --> 00:19:40.831
- Really?

402
00:19:40.875 --> 00:19:42.920
Let me give you a ride.

403
00:19:42.964 --> 00:19:44.400
- The Nest is right
down the street.

404
00:19:44.444 --> 00:19:47.229
- Well then. let me
walk with you.

405
00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:51.102
- It's a free sidewalk.

406
00:19:54.105 --> 00:19:56.673
[horn honking]

407
00:20:02.288 --> 00:20:04.115
- Same old Owl's Point.

408
00:20:04.159 --> 00:20:04.986
- Yup.

409
00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:07.118
They're gonna change
the lighthouse

410
00:20:07.162 --> 00:20:09.164
into an observation tower.

411
00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:09.773
- Really?

412
00:20:09.817 --> 00:20:11.210
- Yup.

413
00:20:11.253 --> 00:20:11.819
Gonna replace the light
with the tower viewer.

414
00:20:11.862 --> 00:20:12.907
- A what?

415
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:13.995
- You know one of
those things you

416
00:20:14.038 --> 00:20:15.518
put money into to
look through to--

417
00:20:15.562 --> 00:20:16.432
- Oh. yeah!

418
00:20:17.912 --> 00:20:19.000
Wow.

419
00:20:19.043 --> 00:20:20.697
- Keeper isn't happy about it.

420
00:20:20.741 --> 00:20:22.351
- I bet not.

421
00:20:22.395 --> 00:20:24.745
- So how long has it been
since you've been back?

422
00:20:24.788 --> 00:20:25.615
- A few years.

423
00:20:25.659 --> 00:20:27.182
Maybe six or seven.

424
00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:29.837
After the show closed
on Broadway.

425
00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.447
we took it on tour.

426
00:20:32.753 --> 00:20:33.797
I haven't had much time off.

427
00:20:33.841 --> 00:20:35.016
- I see.

428
00:20:35.059 --> 00:20:36.931
- Besides. there
hasn't been a whole

429
00:20:36.974 --> 00:20:38.672
lot of reason to come back.

430
00:20:38.715 --> 00:20:39.629
- What about Keeper?

431
00:20:39.673 --> 00:20:40.239
- Keeper?

432
00:20:41.501 --> 00:20:43.851
My Dad and I don't exactly
see eye to eye.

433
00:20:43.894 --> 00:20:45.374
- Well how do you know
when you haven't been here

434
00:20:45.418 --> 00:20:47.376
to look him in the eye?

435
00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:50.379
- Let's just say that my
departure from Owl's Point

436
00:20:50.423 --> 00:20:52.686
did not meet with his approval.

437
00:20:52.729 --> 00:20:54.862
After all. who'd wanna
give up all this

438
00:20:54.905 --> 00:20:56.646
for life as an actor?

439
00:20:57.821 --> 00:21:00.171
- Is that a rhetorical question?

440
00:21:00.215 --> 00:21:01.347
- Don't get me wrong.

441
00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:04.480
Owl's Point is great
for some people.

442
00:21:04.524 --> 00:21:06.352
- For uninspired people like me.

443
00:21:06.395 --> 00:21:08.571
- Didn't you ever wanna
see what's out there?

444
00:21:08.615 --> 00:21:12.053
What's out beyond
that lighthouse?

445
00:21:12.096 --> 00:21:14.316
- Tell me. August the Star.

446
00:21:15.361 --> 00:21:16.362
what's out there?

447
00:21:17.798 --> 00:21:21.018
What's out there that
can't be found right here?

448
00:21:21.062 --> 00:21:23.412
- [August] To each their own.

449
00:21:30.985 --> 00:21:33.074
- And who are your own?

450
00:21:33.117 --> 00:21:34.380
The paparazzi?

451
00:21:34.423 --> 00:21:36.904
Fanatic fans. the
suffocating crowds?

452
00:21:36.947 --> 00:21:38.514
- Don't knock it til you try it.

453
00:21:38.558 --> 00:21:40.995
- What about the people
who really love you?

454
00:21:41.038 --> 00:21:42.431
- Really love me?

455
00:21:43.432 --> 00:21:45.042
What's. what's real?

456
00:21:46.217 --> 00:21:49.873
Real is what you
pretend real to be.

457
00:21:49.917 --> 00:21:51.266
I'm an actor remember?

458
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.572
- What about Keeper?

459
00:21:52.615 --> 00:21:54.225
He is real.

460
00:21:54.269 --> 00:21:55.488
- I pay for his care.

461
00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:00.057
- That's right. money
solves all ones problems.

462
00:22:00.101 --> 00:22:03.322
- It's a lot more than
some people do.

463
00:22:03.365 --> 00:22:07.151
Look. my Dad's nickname
is more than accurate.

464
00:22:08.892 --> 00:22:11.678
Especially when it comes to me.

465
00:22:11.721 --> 00:22:14.637
He saw his duty was not only
keeping that lighthouse.

466
00:22:14.681 --> 00:22:17.423
but keeping me locked in
it at all costs.

467
00:22:17.466 --> 00:22:20.904
Even at the cost of
my happiness.

468
00:22:20.948 --> 00:22:22.036
Is that love?

469
00:22:24.473 --> 00:22:26.214
- So you were abused?

470
00:22:28.608 --> 00:22:30.218
- Just detained.

471
00:22:30.261 --> 00:22:32.873
- Maybe Keeper thought he
knew what was best for you.

472
00:22:32.916 --> 00:22:35.397
We all make mistakes.

473
00:22:35.441 --> 00:22:37.312
- And some of us are able to

474
00:22:37.356 --> 00:22:39.445
admit to those mistakes.

475
00:22:39.488 --> 00:22:43.362
- Maybe the apple didn't
fall far from the lighthouse.

476
00:22:43.405 --> 00:22:45.320
- Maybe this walk wasn't
such a good idea.

477
00:22:45.364 --> 00:22:46.277
- Then maybe it's a
good thing we have

478
00:22:46.321 --> 00:22:48.845
arrived at the end of the line.

479
00:23:04.731 --> 00:23:05.688
Hi Carol.

480
00:23:05.732 --> 00:23:08.038
- [Carol] Hello. how are you?

481
00:23:10.737 --> 00:23:12.478
- It's nice to see you
again August.

482
00:23:12.521 --> 00:23:14.175
- Nice to see you Mandy.

483
00:23:14.218 --> 00:23:15.350
- You'll find Keeper's
room down the hall

484
00:23:15.394 --> 00:23:16.786
and to the right.

485
00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:17.787
Don't forget to sign in

486
00:23:17.831 --> 00:23:20.573
and sanitize your hands.

487
00:23:20.616 --> 00:23:22.096
- So. what are you?

488
00:23:22.139 --> 00:23:23.880
A secretary or something?

489
00:23:23.924 --> 00:23:25.316
- Something like that.

490
00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.579
Goodbye Auggie.

491
00:23:26.622 --> 00:23:28.015
Afternoon ladies.

492
00:23:29.495 --> 00:23:30.321
- Amanda.

493
00:23:31.453 --> 00:23:34.369
Mandy. of course
she'd be the boss.

494
00:23:39.026 --> 00:23:41.202
- Sorry. excuse me.

495
00:23:41.245 --> 00:23:42.029
- Hey Dan.

496
00:23:42.072 --> 00:23:43.900
- [Dan] Oh. hi ladies.

497
00:23:52.953 --> 00:23:55.564
[door knocking]

498
00:23:58.741 --> 00:23:59.525
- Dad?

499
00:24:06.227 --> 00:24:07.446
Dad?

500
00:24:07.489 --> 00:24:09.143
- Oh. he's sleeping.

501
00:24:10.318 --> 00:24:11.450
- Oh. I'm sorry.

502
00:24:11.493 --> 00:24:13.060
I thought he was alone.

503
00:24:13.103 --> 00:24:14.931
- I'm Mike. our caregiver.

504
00:24:14.975 --> 00:24:16.542
Keeper's one of my regulars.

505
00:24:16.585 --> 00:24:18.674
You must be August.

506
00:24:18.718 --> 00:24:19.762
- How did you know?

507
00:24:19.806 --> 00:24:21.634
- You just called him Dad.

508
00:24:21.677 --> 00:24:22.635
[August chuckling]

509
00:24:22.678 --> 00:24:23.853
- [August] Right.

510
00:24:23.897 --> 00:24:25.072
- It's nice to meet you.

511
00:24:25.115 --> 00:24:26.377
I've heard a lot about you.

512
00:24:26.421 --> 00:24:27.291
- Really?

513
00:24:27.335 --> 00:24:28.467
Anything you can repeat?

514
00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:29.642
[Mike laughing]

515
00:24:29.685 --> 00:24:31.165
- Well. actually all of it.

516
00:24:31.208 --> 00:24:34.298
I heard about your many
fishing excursions for bass.

517
00:24:34.342 --> 00:24:37.693
Right. your sailing
adventures to Willow Island.

518
00:24:37.737 --> 00:24:39.652
and oh. your hunts buried
pirate treasure

519
00:24:39.695 --> 00:24:41.001
along the shore.

520
00:24:42.219 --> 00:24:43.438
And how you and Keeper
worked together

521
00:24:43.482 --> 00:24:44.918
protecting the coast
by making sure

522
00:24:44.961 --> 00:24:47.007
the light never went out.

523
00:24:53.187 --> 00:24:55.842
- That was a long time ago.

524
00:24:55.885 --> 00:24:57.887
- Not to Keeper.

525
00:24:57.931 --> 00:25:00.411
To him. it happened yesterday.

526
00:25:04.328 --> 00:25:05.155
What is it?

527
00:25:05.199 --> 00:25:06.940
- Do we know each other?

528
00:25:06.983 --> 00:25:08.332
You look familiar.

529
00:25:08.376 --> 00:25:09.638
- Well. maybe for the
fact that I was witness

530
00:25:09.682 --> 00:25:10.770
to you nearly turning
the center's

531
00:25:10.813 --> 00:25:12.946
Administrator into a speed bump.

532
00:25:12.989 --> 00:25:14.469
- That's it!

533
00:25:14.513 --> 00:25:16.863
You were the guy that ran
in the middle of the road.

534
00:25:16.906 --> 00:25:17.820
- You seemed distracted.

535
00:25:17.864 --> 00:25:20.562
- Yeah. well. I thought I...

536
00:25:20.606 --> 00:25:22.738
You didn't see a man
and a boy in raincoats

537
00:25:22.782 --> 00:25:24.740
sitting outside the ice
cream parlor did you?

538
00:25:24.784 --> 00:25:26.394
- Well. I can't say I did.

539
00:25:26.437 --> 00:25:27.961
Why?

540
00:25:28.004 --> 00:25:29.049
- Nevermind.

541
00:25:29.092 --> 00:25:32.008
[slow paced music]

542
00:25:37.448 --> 00:25:38.798
I'll come back later.

543
00:25:38.841 --> 00:25:40.495
- Why later?

544
00:25:40.539 --> 00:25:42.453
- When he's awake.

545
00:25:42.497 --> 00:25:44.543
- What you see is what you get.

546
00:25:44.586 --> 00:25:45.805
- Really?

547
00:25:45.848 --> 00:25:47.328
- Pretty much.

548
00:25:47.371 --> 00:25:49.112
When you sleep 20 hours a day.

549
00:25:49.156 --> 00:25:51.506
losing 15 minutes is not
gonna make a big difference.

550
00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:52.420
Keeper.
[Keeper groans]

551
00:25:52.463 --> 00:25:53.464
- Keeper!
[Keeper groans]

552
00:25:53.508 --> 00:25:54.770
- Keeper wake up.

553
00:25:54.814 --> 00:25:56.555
I have a surprise for you.

554
00:25:56.598 --> 00:25:57.599
- [Keeper] What is it?

555
00:25:57.643 --> 00:25:59.122
- Look who's here.

556
00:26:00.297 --> 00:26:01.168
- It's about time.

557
00:26:01.211 --> 00:26:02.517
What took him so long?

558
00:26:02.561 --> 00:26:04.737
- Well better late than
never. right Keeper?

559
00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:06.434
- What's for dinner?

560
00:26:09.785 --> 00:26:12.048
- Lasagna. your favorite.

561
00:26:12.092 --> 00:26:13.746
Maybe August can join you.

562
00:26:13.789 --> 00:26:15.269
- Auggie!

563
00:26:15.312 --> 00:26:16.270
Where is he?

564
00:26:16.313 --> 00:26:17.706
- I'm right here.

565
00:26:19.012 --> 00:26:21.536
It's good to see you again Dad.

566
00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:22.537
- What's going on here?

567
00:26:22.581 --> 00:26:24.713
- It's me. August. Auggie.

568
00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:28.021
- I don't know you.

569
00:26:28.064 --> 00:26:30.023
- Keeper. it's your son.

570
00:26:31.111 --> 00:26:32.721
- That's not my son.

571
00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:36.029
Auggie's at school.

572
00:26:36.072 --> 00:26:38.422
- Keeper. August drove
all this way--

573
00:26:38.466 --> 00:26:41.251
- I told you. that
is not Auggie!

574
00:26:41.295 --> 00:26:42.383
- It's okay Mike.

575
00:26:42.426 --> 00:26:43.079
- Get him out of here!

576
00:26:43.123 --> 00:26:44.472
- But Keeper--

577
00:26:44.515 --> 00:26:45.821
- [Keeper] Look at him
what's wrong with you!

578
00:26:45.865 --> 00:26:47.388
- [August] I better leave.

579
00:26:47.431 --> 00:26:49.433
- Good. get out!

580
00:26:49.477 --> 00:26:50.304
Out!

581
00:26:52.175 --> 00:26:53.394
- Come back later.

582
00:26:53.437 --> 00:26:55.788
August. these things take time.

583
00:26:55.831 --> 00:26:57.050
He'll be fine when
he calms down.

584
00:26:57.093 --> 00:26:58.617
- Sure.

585
00:26:58.660 --> 00:26:59.618
See ya Mike.

586
00:27:00.923 --> 00:27:02.359
- Why did you let him in here?

587
00:27:02.403 --> 00:27:04.448
- [Mike] I'm sorry Keeper.

588
00:27:04.492 --> 00:27:05.928
- [Keeper] That's not Auggie.

589
00:27:05.972 --> 00:27:06.799
Auggie's at school!

590
00:27:06.842 --> 00:27:08.148
- [Mike] I know.

591
00:27:09.497 --> 00:27:10.890
- [Keeper] What's for dinner?

592
00:27:10.933 --> 00:27:11.804
- [Mike] Lasagna.

593
00:27:11.847 --> 00:27:14.067
- [Keeper] Oh. my favorite.

594
00:27:15.982 --> 00:27:17.766
[slow paced music]

595
00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:20.464
- Sir. don't forget to sign out.

596
00:27:26.209 --> 00:27:29.038
[rustling waters]

597
00:28:12.212 --> 00:28:15.128
[thunder rumbling]

598
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:19.828
- August. stop playing games!

599
00:28:19.872 --> 00:28:22.091
We got work to do. come on!

600
00:28:22.135 --> 00:28:24.920
- [August] I hate this place.

601
00:28:24.964 --> 00:28:26.530
- [Little Girl] Excuse me.

602
00:28:26.574 --> 00:28:27.662
Excuse me.

603
00:28:27.706 --> 00:28:28.924
- Oh. hi.

604
00:28:28.968 --> 00:28:30.273
Can I help you?

605
00:28:30.317 --> 00:28:31.927
- May I have your autograph?

606
00:28:31.971 --> 00:28:33.146
- My autograph?

607
00:28:33.189 --> 00:28:34.538
- Yes please.

608
00:28:34.582 --> 00:28:36.932
- Sure. I'd be happy to sign.

609
00:28:36.976 --> 00:28:37.977
What's your name?

610
00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:39.239
- Olivia.

611
00:28:39.282 --> 00:28:40.109
- Olivia.

612
00:28:41.154 --> 00:28:41.981
To Olivia.

613
00:28:45.201 --> 00:28:46.202
always reach

614
00:28:47.856 --> 00:28:48.988
for the stars.

615
00:28:54.384 --> 00:28:55.864
There ya go.

616
00:28:55.908 --> 00:28:57.387
- August Star. oh.

617
00:28:58.432 --> 00:28:59.346
- What is it?

618
00:28:59.389 --> 00:29:01.000
- I thought you were famous.

619
00:29:01.043 --> 00:29:02.305
- Famous huh?

620
00:29:02.349 --> 00:29:03.306
Who told you that?

621
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:04.743
- My Mom.

622
00:29:04.786 --> 00:29:07.484
- [August] Where is she?

623
00:29:07.528 --> 00:29:08.964
That's your Mom?

624
00:29:09.008 --> 00:29:10.661
- Yeah.

625
00:29:10.705 --> 00:29:12.533
Can I go play with my
friends now?

626
00:29:12.576 --> 00:29:13.403
- Sure.

627
00:29:13.447 --> 00:29:14.404
Stay away from the water.

628
00:29:14.448 --> 00:29:15.710
- [Olivia] Okay!

629
00:29:15.754 --> 00:29:17.973
- Here. let me take your
pen and notebook.

630
00:29:18.017 --> 00:29:19.192
- Thanks.

631
00:29:19.235 --> 00:29:22.586
You're a pretty good guy.
for a nobody.

632
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:23.936
[kids screaming]

633
00:29:23.979 --> 00:29:24.763
- Thanks.

634
00:29:25.981 --> 00:29:28.462
Yup. definitely related.

635
00:29:28.505 --> 00:29:29.985
No doubt about it.

636
00:29:32.335 --> 00:29:33.815
An autograph?

637
00:29:33.859 --> 00:29:35.251
- Oh. I didn't want
you to feel like

638
00:29:35.295 --> 00:29:38.951
a fish out of water here
in little old Owl's Point.

639
00:29:38.994 --> 00:29:40.779
I know how much you show
people you crave attention.

640
00:29:40.822 --> 00:29:41.649
- We do?

641
00:29:43.085 --> 00:29:44.304
- Yeah. you do.

642
00:29:45.609 --> 00:29:47.307
- That was my manager's doing.

643
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:48.830
- Oh.

644
00:29:48.874 --> 00:29:49.700
Of course.

645
00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:53.008
How was your visit with Keeper?

646
00:29:53.052 --> 00:29:54.096
- Good.

647
00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:55.358
- Really?

648
00:29:55.402 --> 00:29:55.794
- Yeah.

649
00:29:57.404 --> 00:30:01.974
- You're not gonna win any
awards with that performance.

650
00:30:02.017 --> 00:30:03.932
- All right. it could
have gone better.

651
00:30:03.976 --> 00:30:05.020
- For who. you or Keeper?

652
00:30:05.064 --> 00:30:06.152
- Excuse me?

653
00:30:06.195 --> 00:30:07.936
- You haven't been
here in how long?

654
00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:09.503
- So my leaving caused this?

655
00:30:09.546 --> 00:30:10.417
- No. this would've
happened to Keeper

656
00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:12.071
if you were here or not.

657
00:30:12.114 --> 00:30:13.550
But Auggie. you haven't been in

658
00:30:13.594 --> 00:30:16.597
his life in a long time.
have you?

659
00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.034
- I suppose not much.

660
00:30:19.078 --> 00:30:22.168
- Listen. this isn't a
scientific explanation.

661
00:30:22.211 --> 00:30:23.517
but it may help you understand

662
00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:25.519
what your Dad is going through.

663
00:30:25.562 --> 00:30:28.043
Picture the brain as a
head of lettuce.

664
00:30:28.087 --> 00:30:30.959
Memories from the past are
in the center of the head.

665
00:30:31.003 --> 00:30:34.267
and the more recent memories
are the leaves on the outside.

666
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:37.226
And as you peel those
leaves away.

667
00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:39.620
those memories just--

668
00:30:39.663 --> 00:30:41.100
- Disappear.

669
00:30:41.143 --> 00:30:41.927
- Yeah.

670
00:30:43.798 --> 00:30:46.540
Keeper does remember you Auggie.

671
00:30:46.583 --> 00:30:48.934
but to him you're a teenager.

672
00:30:50.239 --> 00:30:51.893
- [August] And your daughter?

673
00:30:51.937 --> 00:30:52.894
- [Amanda] What about her?

674
00:30:52.938 --> 00:30:54.853
- Olivia's Dad.

675
00:30:54.896 --> 00:30:57.246
Mr. Benson I presume?

676
00:30:57.290 --> 00:30:59.509
- You presume correctly.

677
00:30:59.553 --> 00:31:01.207
- How long have you
been married?

678
00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:05.211
- Next month. it would
have been 11 years.

679
00:31:05.254 --> 00:31:06.603
- So he left you?

680
00:31:06.647 --> 00:31:07.474
- He

681
00:31:08.997 --> 00:31:09.824
left me

682
00:31:10.956 --> 00:31:12.174
when his Humvee ran over

683
00:31:12.218 --> 00:31:14.960
an IED on a desert road
in Afghanistan.

684
00:31:16.483 --> 00:31:21.575
Rob was deployed five months
before Olivia was born.

685
00:31:21.618 --> 00:31:24.273
They never got a chance
to meet each other.

686
00:31:24.317 --> 00:31:25.013
Listen.

687
00:31:26.406 --> 00:31:28.712
I knew what I was doing
when I married the Army.

688
00:31:28.756 --> 00:31:31.759
and I would do it
all over again.

689
00:31:31.802 --> 00:31:34.240
Besides. Rob and
Olivia aren't the

690
00:31:34.283 --> 00:31:36.633
parent and child we need
to talk about right now.

691
00:31:36.677 --> 00:31:37.808
- Let's not go there.

692
00:31:37.852 --> 00:31:40.159
- Listen. I have an idea.

693
00:31:40.202 --> 00:31:42.465
- Hm. what kind of an idea?

694
00:31:42.509 --> 00:31:44.293
- A good one.

695
00:31:44.337 --> 00:31:45.642
At least

696
00:31:45.686 --> 00:31:49.255
I think it could possibly
be a good one.

697
00:31:49.298 --> 00:31:50.604
Maybe.

698
00:31:50.647 --> 00:31:52.214
- That's reassuring.

699
00:31:52.258 --> 00:31:53.041
- Just listen.

700
00:31:53.085 --> 00:31:54.521
- [August] I'm listening.

701
00:31:54.564 --> 00:31:56.349
- Miracles do happen.

702
00:31:56.392 --> 00:31:57.219
- Nice.

703
00:31:58.525 --> 00:32:00.179
- Just promise me that
you will drive

704
00:32:00.222 --> 00:32:02.659
that fancy car of yours
over to the Owl's Nest

705
00:32:02.703 --> 00:32:04.574
and nine a.m. tomorrow.

706
00:32:04.618 --> 00:32:05.401
- But I'm--

707
00:32:05.445 --> 00:32:06.228
- Promise?

708
00:32:09.014 --> 00:32:11.451
- All right. I promise.

709
00:32:11.494 --> 00:32:12.843
- Great.

710
00:32:12.887 --> 00:32:14.715
I'll see you tomorrow.

711
00:32:19.415 --> 00:32:21.678
August. where are you staying?

712
00:32:23.028 --> 00:32:27.293
- Frankly. I haven't
thought that far ahead.

713
00:32:27.336 --> 00:32:28.903
- Here. take these.

714
00:32:31.906 --> 00:32:35.518
- You're okay with me
staying at your place?

715
00:32:37.564 --> 00:32:41.263
- Those are Keeper's
keys to his house.

716
00:32:41.307 --> 00:32:42.830
Your home Auggie.

717
00:32:42.873 --> 00:32:44.310
- You know. maybe
staying at your place

718
00:32:44.353 --> 00:32:46.225
wasn't such a bad idea?

719
00:32:48.749 --> 00:32:50.185
- What's the matter.
are you uncomfortable?

720
00:32:50.229 --> 00:32:51.621
- Well--

721
00:32:51.665 --> 00:32:54.624
- Auggie. sometimes you
have to be uncomfortable

722
00:32:54.668 --> 00:32:56.148
to be comfortable.

723
00:32:58.628 --> 00:33:00.021
See you tomorrow.

724
00:33:01.109 --> 00:33:02.632
Nine a.m.

725
00:33:02.676 --> 00:33:03.503
- Right!

726
00:33:04.547 --> 00:33:06.071
Hey Mandy!

727
00:33:06.114 --> 00:33:07.072
- What!

728
00:33:07.115 --> 00:33:08.595
- What's the second key for?

729
00:33:08.638 --> 00:33:09.944
- I don't know.

730
00:33:09.988 --> 00:33:11.815
I'll see you tomorrow.

731
00:33:14.557 --> 00:33:17.212
[kids laughing]

732
00:33:22.435 --> 00:33:26.047
- [Mike] Is there

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:19.091
- I know you were.

919
00:44:19.134 --> 00:44:19.918
But she--

920
00:44:19.961 --> 00:44:21.223
- I hate her.

921
00:44:21.267 --> 00:44:22.877
As much as she must hate me.

922
00:44:22.921 --> 00:44:25.358
- No. no. no. no. no. Auggie.

923
00:44:25.401 --> 00:44:28.230
Don't hate her. if anything.
pray for her.

924
00:44:28.274 --> 00:44:29.144
- Pray?

925
00:44:29.188 --> 00:44:30.102
For her?

926
00:44:30.145 --> 00:44:31.625
- Yes.

927
00:44:31.669 --> 00:44:34.846
Pray that God brings his light

928
00:44:34.889 --> 00:44:36.456
into her life.

929
00:44:36.499 --> 00:44:39.285
Come on Auggie. after all.
she gave us

930
00:44:39.328 --> 00:44:41.156
something really special.

931
00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:42.767
- And what's that?

932
00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:44.290
- Each other.

933
00:44:44.333 --> 00:44:45.334
- Goodnight.

934
00:44:49.817 --> 00:44:50.644
- Goodnight.

935
00:44:51.776 --> 00:44:55.170
Oh. you ready to blow
out the lamp?

936
00:44:55.214 --> 00:44:56.041
Okay.

937
00:44:57.259 --> 00:44:58.739
One.

938
00:44:58.783 --> 00:44:59.609

939
00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:01.611

[guitar strumming]

943
00:46:23.171 --> 00:46:26.566
- Who in their right mind
plays the lute?

944
00:46:34.182 --> 00:46:35.401
Auggie's shows?

945
00:46:37.403 --> 00:46:38.230
What?

946
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:51.069
What in the world?

947
00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:05.474
Oh come on.

948
00:47:07.302 --> 00:47:08.695
Give me a signal.

949
00:47:11.698 --> 00:47:13.004
Oh. there we go.

950
00:47:20.141 --> 00:47:22.448
Rhonda. hey. this is August.

951
00:47:24.276 --> 00:47:27.888
Listen. I need a few
days. something's come up.

952
00:47:29.107 --> 00:47:32.327
I'm at home in Owl's Point.
Wisconsin.

953
00:47:32.371 --> 00:47:34.286
Do me a favor and tell
Tony I'm gonna

954
00:47:34.329 --> 00:47:37.245
be a few days late
delivering the car to Vegas.

955
00:47:37.289 --> 00:47:39.117
I'll fill you in on the
details later.

956
00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:39.987
I...

957
00:47:41.771 --> 00:47:43.208
See ya.

958
00:47:43.251 --> 00:47:44.818
- Owl's Point. why?

959
00:47:44.862 --> 00:47:46.559
- That's the
question of the day.

960
00:47:46.602 --> 00:47:49.867
Seems like a good place to hide.

961
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:51.042
I gotta tell your cousin.

962
00:47:51.085 --> 00:47:51.869
- Cousin!

963
00:47:51.912 --> 00:47:52.565
- Ow!

964
00:47:52.608 --> 00:47:53.392
Hey. why?

965
00:47:53.435 --> 00:47:54.567
Why would you do that?

966
00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:55.655
- You sent August out
in a hot car!

967
00:47:55.698 --> 00:47:56.917
- Whoa. the car ain't hot.

968
00:47:56.961 --> 00:47:59.093
- The car isn't hot--

969
00:47:59.137 --> 00:48:01.052
- It's the contraband
that's hidden in the car.

970
00:48:01.095 --> 00:48:01.966
That's hot.

971
00:48:02.009 --> 00:48:03.315
- See. the contraband is...

972
00:48:03.358 --> 00:48:04.185
Oh boy.

973
00:48:06.057 --> 00:48:07.536

[door banging]

975
00:48:13.064 --> 00:48:15.849
[chains clanking]

976
00:48:18.504 --> 00:48:20.767
- You two stay put.

977
00:48:20.810 --> 00:48:22.203
- Take your time.

978
00:48:30.646 --> 00:48:33.911
[Tony laughing]

979
00:48:33.954 --> 00:48:35.651
What's so funny?

980
00:48:35.695 --> 00:48:37.610
- I love this place.
I love my job.

981
00:48:37.653 --> 00:48:39.481
- Stop messing around!

982
00:48:41.614 --> 00:48:42.354
Your cousin?

983
00:48:43.572 --> 00:48:46.880
We're being held hostage
by your cousin?

984
00:48:47.837 --> 00:48:48.534
Nice family.

985
00:48:49.752 --> 00:48:51.711
- Listen Rhonda. I
didn't know anything

986
00:48:51.754 --> 00:48:52.842
about any contraband.

987
00:48:52.886 --> 00:48:53.887
You have to believe me.

988
00:48:53.931 --> 00:48:54.366
- Yeah right.

989
00:48:55.976 --> 00:48:59.893
- And. in fact. if we be in
it'd be safer for all of us

990
00:48:59.937 --> 00:49:01.242
if we didn't know.

991
00:49:01.286 --> 00:49:03.897
- Safer for all of us?

992
00:49:03.941 --> 00:49:05.072
What do you mean?

993
00:49:05.116 --> 00:49:06.595
- Well let's just hope

994
00:49:06.639 --> 00:49:08.467
that August doesn't stumble upon

995
00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:11.035
whatever is in that car.

996
00:49:11.078 --> 00:49:13.646
- So help me Tony. if we
get out of this alive.

997
00:49:13.689 --> 00:49:15.387
I'm going to kill you.

998
00:49:16.388 --> 00:49:19.957
[door knocking]
- Sit down.

999
00:49:23.134 --> 00:49:24.657
- Today's your lucky day.

1000
00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:28.748
We're taking a little
road trip to Wisconsin.

1001
00:49:28.791 --> 00:49:30.402
I love cheese curds.

1002
00:49:45.939 --> 00:49:48.855
[slow paced music]

1003
00:49:52.206 --> 00:49:54.295
- I'm here as promised.

1004
00:49:54.339 --> 00:49:57.168
- Keeper. I would like
you to meet someone.

1005
00:49:57.211 --> 00:49:58.473
- What's going on?

1006
00:49:58.517 --> 00:50:00.649
- This is Keeper's day
to go for a car ride

1007
00:50:00.693 --> 00:50:02.912
and he sure appreciates
the volunteers

1008
00:50:02.956 --> 00:50:04.088
who come every week.

1009
00:50:04.131 --> 00:50:05.002
Don't you keeper?

1010
00:50:05.045 --> 00:50:06.264
- I don't care.

1011
00:50:06.307 --> 00:50:07.613
- Oh. don't you wanna
see Owl's Point?

1012
00:50:07.656 --> 00:50:08.744
- I've seen it.

1013
00:50:08.788 --> 00:50:09.963
Can we go back inside?

1014
00:50:10.007 --> 00:50:11.399
- Oh come on. it'll be fun.

1015
00:50:11.443 --> 00:50:13.227
This nice mans name is

1016
00:50:17.101 --> 00:50:18.711
Harry.

1017
00:50:18.754 --> 00:50:19.625
- Thanks.

1018
00:50:21.192 --> 00:50:23.759
- Well Harry. she won't rest
until we get this over with.

1019
00:50:23.803 --> 00:50:25.413
- Tell me about it.

1020
00:50:25.457 --> 00:50:30.157
- Well what. are 12 clowns
gonna jump out of that tin can?

1021
00:50:39.558 --> 00:50:41.081
- You two have fun.

1022
00:50:42.952 --> 00:50:46.347
- [August] Hey. Mandy. I was
wondering if we could talk?

1023
00:50:46.391 --> 00:50:48.088
- Sure. what is it?

1024
00:50:48.132 --> 00:50:49.046
- Not here.

1025
00:50:50.482 --> 00:50:52.484
I've some questions about
Keeper that I was hoping

1026
00:50:52.527 --> 00:50:55.226
you might be able to shed
some light on.

1027
00:50:55.269 --> 00:50:56.444
- I mean. I really don't
know much about him

1028
00:50:56.488 --> 00:50:58.098
prior to his arrival
at the Nest.

1029
00:50:58.142 --> 00:51:00.274
- Any insight would
be appreciated.

1030
00:51:00.318 --> 00:51:00.927
- Okay.

1031
00:51:02.494 --> 00:51:04.713
Tell you what. Olivia's
staying with a friend tonight.

1032
00:51:04.757 --> 00:51:07.760
I can meet you at the
Bayview restaurant at seven.

1033
00:51:07.803 --> 00:51:08.587
We could talk then.

1034
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:09.457
- Great.

1035
00:51:09.501 --> 00:51:10.415
It's a date.

1036
00:51:10.458 --> 00:51:12.373
[horn honking]

1037
00:51:12.417 --> 00:51:14.723
- Hey. are we going or what?

1038
00:51:14.767 --> 00:51:16.464
- Yeah. yeah we're going.

1039
00:51:16.508 --> 00:51:17.726
Where. I don't know.

1040
00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:19.380
- Well get a map.

1041
00:51:19.424 --> 00:51:20.425
- [August] I have GPS.

1042
00:51:20.468 --> 00:51:21.600
- You have what?

1043
00:51:21.643 --> 00:51:25.821
- I said I have GPS!
[horns honking]

1044
00:51:25.865 --> 00:51:27.693
- He says he has GPS.

1045
00:51:27.736 --> 00:51:31.088
Is it legal to drive with
that condition?

1046
00:51:32.176 --> 00:51:34.917
[engine turning]

1047
00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:45.319
Stop!
[car screeching]

1048
00:51:45.363 --> 00:51:46.146
- [August] What?

1049
00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:46.973
What's wrong?

1050
00:51:47.016 --> 00:51:47.974
- [Keeper] Not here.

1051
00:51:48.017 --> 00:51:49.497
At the stop sign at the corner.

1052
00:51:49.541 --> 00:51:51.543
I didn't want you to miss it.

1053
00:51:51.586 --> 00:51:53.066
- [August] Thanks.

1054
00:51:55.503 --> 00:51:58.071
- [Keeper] What are you doing?

1055
00:51:58.115 --> 00:52:00.029
- [August] I have no idea.

1056
00:52:00.073 --> 00:52:02.815
- [Keeper] That's
what I thought.

1057
00:52:03.772 --> 00:52:05.818
Harry. what are we doing here?

1058
00:52:07.211 --> 00:52:09.430
- I thought we'd take a
trip down memory lane.

1059
00:52:09.474 --> 00:52:10.301
- Oh.

1060
00:52:15.262 --> 00:52:16.307
- [August] When'd you get that?

1061
00:52:16.350 --> 00:52:17.134
- 1972.

1062
00:52:18.657 --> 00:52:20.180
- You remember.

1063
00:52:20.224 --> 00:52:21.312
- It says it right here.

1064
00:52:21.355 --> 00:52:22.617
Can't you read?

1065
00:52:22.661 --> 00:52:24.793
"Regional Champions 1972."

1066
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:28.275
Boy. I had a 196 average.

1067
00:52:30.016 --> 00:52:31.974
- That's right. you did.

1068
00:52:33.324 --> 00:52:34.803
Who made this?

1069
00:52:34.847 --> 00:52:36.501
- Oh. Auggie and I.

1070
00:52:36.544 --> 00:52:38.111
Took us two months.

1071
00:52:39.591 --> 00:52:40.679
- An hour every night.

1072
00:52:40.722 --> 00:52:41.549
- Right.

1073
00:52:43.421 --> 00:52:45.466
Auggie must be at school.

1074
00:52:46.859 --> 00:52:48.121
- Yeah. school.

1075
00:52:56.564 --> 00:52:58.175
Hey.

1076
00:52:58.218 --> 00:52:59.088
what are these?

1077
00:52:59.132 --> 00:52:59.959
- Oh.

1078
00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:04.268
I don't know.

1079
00:53:04.311 --> 00:53:06.879
Never seen 'em before. garbage.

1080
00:53:15.235 --> 00:53:17.106
What are you doing?

1081
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:18.760
- I thought we'd take a
few things back.

1082
00:53:18.804 --> 00:53:19.848
- Back where?

1083
00:53:19.892 --> 00:53:21.937
- Back to your room.

1084
00:53:21.981 --> 00:53:25.027
- My room is right
through that door.

1085
00:53:26.899 --> 00:53:28.727
Auggie must be at school.

1086
00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:30.032
- Can't you see
Auggie is right--

1087
00:53:30.076 --> 00:53:31.904
- Harry. are you okay?

1088
00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:37.214
- Yeah.

1089
00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:39.477
I'm fine.

1090
00:53:47.441 --> 00:53:48.573
Hey. you know.

1091
00:53:49.791 --> 00:53:50.618
I think I know where we might

1092
00:53:50.662 --> 00:53:52.403
be able to find Auggie.

1093
00:53:52.446 --> 00:53:53.708
- Really?

1094
00:53:53.752 --> 00:53:54.970
Well. let's go.

1095
00:54:08.941 --> 00:54:11.770
[rustling waters]

1096
00:54:25.653 --> 00:54:27.916
- Come on. let's go take a look.

1097
00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:29.266
- [Keeper] What are
we doing here?

1098
00:54:29.309 --> 00:54:31.442
- Looking to see if
Auggie is here.

1099
00:54:31.485 --> 00:54:33.357
- You won't find him here.

1100
00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:34.183
- Why not?

1101
00:54:34.227 --> 00:54:36.360
- Auggie hates this place.

1102
00:54:48.676 --> 00:54:49.460
Oh yeah.

1103
00:54:51.592 --> 00:54:52.376
Yeah.

1104
00:54:57.250 --> 00:55:00.253
- Go figure. it burns out
right when we walk in.

1105
00:55:00.297 --> 00:55:02.255
- Oh. you see. right there.

1106
00:55:02.299 --> 00:55:04.126
Right there is where Auggie said

1107
00:55:04.170 --> 00:55:05.824
we were just actors.

1108
00:55:07.129 --> 00:55:09.306
Can you believe it?

1109
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:11.482
- Yeah. that's awful.

1110
00:55:11.525 --> 00:55:13.179
- What'd ya say?

1111
00:55:13.222 --> 00:55:16.574
- Oh. I just said that maybe
Auggie changed his mind.

1112
00:55:16.617 --> 00:55:19.707
Maybe he doesn't
hate this place.

1113
00:55:19.751 --> 00:55:20.273
Oh.

1114
00:55:21.492 --> 00:55:24.712
Looks like they started
the remodeling.

1115
00:55:26.758 --> 00:55:28.107
That's right. they took
the light out

1116
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:29.891
and they're gonna put
in an observation deck.

1117
00:55:29.935 --> 00:55:30.936
- Observation deck?

1118
00:55:30.979 --> 00:55:31.806
For what?

1119
00:55:31.850 --> 00:55:32.677
- For tourists.

1120
00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:34.331
- Tourists?

1121
00:55:34.374 --> 00:55:35.897
You're crazy.

1122
00:55:35.941 --> 00:55:36.942
They can't do that.

1123
00:55:36.985 --> 00:55:38.857
The light's too important.

1124
00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:40.554
- Times change.

1125
00:55:40.598 --> 00:55:41.512
- Yeah. yeah.

1126
00:55:42.556 --> 00:55:45.820
There's something
here for Auggie.

1127
00:55:45.864 --> 00:55:47.474
- What's here?

1128
00:55:47.518 --> 00:55:48.954
- The light.

1129
00:55:48.997 --> 00:55:51.260
- I just told you. the
light is gone.

1130
00:55:51.304 --> 00:55:54.655
- Remind me to tell Auggie
that it's here.

1131
00:55:54.699 --> 00:55:56.178
The light is here.

1132
00:55:58.180 --> 00:56:00.661
Well. come on Harry. let's go.

1133
00:56:05.536 --> 00:56:06.363
Harry!

1134
00:56:08.147 --> 00:56:10.323
- Yeah. I'm coming Keeper.

1135
00:56:14.371 --> 00:56:16.198
Well Keeper. we're back.

1136
00:56:16.242 --> 00:56:17.939
Did you enjoy your trip?

1137
00:56:17.983 --> 00:56:19.985
- Well. it wasn't the worst.

1138
00:56:21.247 --> 00:56:24.076
- Would you like to do it
again sometime?

1139
00:56:24.119 --> 00:56:25.207
- Maybe.

1140
00:56:25.251 --> 00:56:27.645
- Well. at least
that isn't a no.

1141
00:56:27.688 --> 00:56:28.602
Here. let's make sure you got

1142
00:56:28.646 --> 00:56:29.647
all your treasures--

1143
00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:31.039
[lighthouse clanking]

1144
00:56:31.083 --> 00:56:31.997
- Look what you made me do.

1145
00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:32.867
- Sorry.

1146
00:56:32.911 --> 00:56:34.347
Here. let me help.

1147
00:56:34.391 --> 00:56:35.914
- All right.

1148
00:56:35.957 --> 00:56:38.003
Wait. what's this?

1149
00:56:38.046 --> 00:56:39.396
- I don't know. what is it?

1150
00:56:39.439 --> 00:56:40.701
- It's my marbles!

1151
00:56:40.745 --> 00:56:42.268
[bag clanking]

1152
00:56:42.311 --> 00:56:44.792
I thought I'd lost my marbles.

1153
00:56:54.193 --> 00:56:56.761
[door ringing]

1154
00:56:59.633 --> 00:57:02.244
- [Kate] Can I help you?

1155
00:57:02.288 --> 00:57:04.638
- Yes. I'm Special Agent Ketchum

1156
00:57:04.682 --> 00:57:05.987
and this is Agent Howard.

1157
00:57:06.031 --> 00:57:07.424
We're with the FBI.

1158
00:57:07.467 --> 00:57:09.208
- Farm Bureau?

1159
00:57:09.251 --> 00:57:12.037
- Federal Bureau of
Investigation.

1160
00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:13.212
We're looking for someone who

1161
00:57:13.255 --> 00:57:15.344
may have past through
town recently.

1162
00:57:15.388 --> 00:57:16.998
- Agent Ketchum?

1163
00:57:17.042 --> 00:57:18.652
You're kidding. right?

1164
00:57:18.696 --> 00:57:20.872
- I don't understand.

1165
00:57:20.915 --> 00:57:23.309
- Of course you don't.

1166
00:57:23.352 --> 00:57:25.137
- We're looking for someone who

1167
00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:27.705
may have been driving this car.

1168
00:57:29.271 --> 00:57:31.012
- I didn't see any car.

1169
00:57:32.144 --> 00:57:33.711
- Well. anybody come
in that seemed

1170
00:57:33.754 --> 00:57:36.409
like he was from out of town?

1171
00:57:36.453 --> 00:57:39.020
- You mean espresso boy?

1172
00:57:39.064 --> 00:57:39.934
- Excuse me?

1173
00:57:41.283 --> 00:57:43.764
- The fella that left
you with that $50 tip.

1174
00:57:43.808 --> 00:57:47.159
- Oh yeah. there was this
handsome fella.

1175
00:57:47.202 --> 00:57:49.074
- He wore a baseball cap

1176
00:57:49.117 --> 00:57:50.554
and dark sunglasses.

1177
00:57:50.597 --> 00:57:52.251
- Sunglasses inside.

1178
00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:54.514
That's odd.

1179
00:57:54.558 --> 00:57:55.384
- You think?

1180
00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:58.910
Must've been trying to
hide something.

1181
00:57:58.953 --> 00:58:00.085
- What did he do?

1182
00:58:00.128 --> 00:58:01.434
- Just drank his coffee.

1183
00:58:01.478 --> 00:58:03.088
- Anything else?

1184
00:58:03.131 --> 00:58:05.003
- No. just drank his coffee

1185
00:58:05.046 --> 00:58:08.093
and talked on the phone
the entire time.

1186
00:58:08.136 --> 00:58:08.963
- To whom?

1187
00:58:09.007 --> 00:58:10.443
Who did he talk to?

1188
00:58:10.487 --> 00:58:12.750
- Well. if I recall.

1189
00:58:12.793 --> 00:58:16.188
the conversation was with
somebody he called boss.

1190
00:58:16.231 --> 00:58:17.668
- Boss?

1191
00:58:17.711 --> 00:58:21.802
- Said he was going to
make a drop in Las Vegas.

1192
00:58:21.846 --> 00:58:23.064
- Really?

1193
00:58:23.108 --> 00:58:24.413
Is that all?

1194
00:58:24.457 --> 00:58:26.241
- Well pretty much.

1195
00:58:26.285 --> 00:58:27.460
For that call.

1196
00:58:28.461 --> 00:58:29.593
- There was another call?

1197
00:58:29.636 --> 00:58:30.768
- Yup.

1198
00:58:30.811 --> 00:58:32.378
Someone thought it was important

1199
00:58:32.421 --> 00:58:35.512
that he knew there
was an escape.

1200
00:58:35.555 --> 00:58:36.382
- Escape?

1201
00:58:38.906 --> 00:58:39.690
Well. thank you.

1202
00:58:39.733 --> 00:58:41.779
You've been most helpful.

1203
00:58:44.521 --> 00:58:47.306
- You won't find him
in Las Vegas.

1204
00:58:50.396 --> 00:58:51.963
- And. why not son?

1205
00:58:53.704 --> 00:58:55.619
- Because I know where he went.

1206
00:58:55.662 --> 00:58:56.533
- [August] And do you
know how to get to

1207
00:58:56.576 --> 00:58:58.404
Owl's Point Wisconsin?

1208
00:59:00.058 --> 00:59:01.276
- [Boy] Oh yeah. yeah.

1209
00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:02.495
So what you're gonna do
is you're gonna

1210
00:59:02.539 --> 00:59:05.716
take this road down to
Highway 151 North.

1211
00:59:16.204 --> 00:59:17.031
- Evening.

1212
00:59:17.075 --> 00:59:18.119
- Hi. Mandy Benson?

1213
00:59:18.163 --> 00:59:19.599
- Yes. Benson right here.

1214
00:59:19.643 --> 00:59:20.948
- Thank you.

1215
00:59:20.992 --> 00:59:22.297
I'm sorry I'm late.

1216
00:59:22.341 --> 00:59:23.560
I wanted to pick
these up for you

1217
00:59:23.603 --> 00:59:26.171
to thank you for
everything you've done.

1218
00:59:26.214 --> 00:59:27.172
- How sweet of you.

1219
00:59:27.215 --> 00:59:29.261
They're beautiful.

1220
00:59:29.304 --> 00:59:30.392
But you shouldn't have.

1221
00:59:30.436 --> 00:59:32.264
- Hey. where are mine?

1222
00:59:33.526 --> 00:59:34.919
- August. this is Martha.

1223
00:59:34.962 --> 00:59:37.574
She is a resident at the
Owl's Rest Nursing Home.

1224
00:59:37.617 --> 00:59:40.577
She has known Keeper
for many years.

1225
00:59:41.795 --> 00:59:42.883
- Hi Auggie.

1226
00:59:42.927 --> 00:59:44.406
- Hi Martha.

1227
00:59:44.450 --> 00:59:45.277
- Have a seat.

1228
00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:46.626
Take a load off.

1229
00:59:54.112 --> 00:59:55.417
- I thought Martha could
shed some light

1230
00:59:55.461 --> 00:59:58.986
on Keeper's life after
you left Owl's Point.

1231
01:00:00.074 --> 01:00:00.901
Here's a menu.

1232
01:00:00.945 --> 01:00:01.728
- Thanks.

1233
01:00:01.772 --> 01:00:02.729
Good idea.

1234
01:00:02.773 --> 01:00:03.643
I guess.

1235
01:00:03.687 --> 01:00:05.558
- You were right Mandy.

1236
01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:06.254
- Right about what?

1237
01:00:06.298 --> 01:00:07.516
- Nothing.

1238
01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:10.476
- You are even better
looking in person.

1239
01:00:10.519 --> 01:00:11.346
- Really?

1240
01:00:12.826 --> 01:00:15.307
And so are you Martha.

1241
01:00:15.350 --> 01:00:16.177
- You dog!

1242
01:00:17.439 --> 01:00:20.138
Flattery will get
you everywhere.

1243
01:00:26.405 --> 01:00:29.408
- Martha. why don't you
take a look at the menu.

1244
01:00:29.451 --> 01:00:32.585
We should probably choose
what we're gonna eat tonight.

1245
01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:36.023
Although I've suddenly
lost my appetite.

1246
01:00:36.067 --> 01:00:37.938
- Until Keeper started to.

1247
01:00:37.982 --> 01:00:40.158
well. you know. forget things.

1248
01:00:41.550 --> 01:00:44.684
He could tell almost
anything about marine life

1249
01:00:44.728 --> 01:00:46.643
on the Great Lakes.

1250
01:00:46.686 --> 01:00:48.383
- Don't I know it.

1251
01:00:48.427 --> 01:00:51.386
- He would always say. "I don't
have to go see the world."--

1252
01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:53.388
- The world always
comes to see me.

1253
01:00:53.432 --> 01:00:54.607
- That's right.

1254
01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:56.914
From his advantage point

1255
01:00:56.957 --> 01:00:59.394
on top of that lighthouse.

1256
01:00:59.438 --> 01:01:03.572
he saw the ships from all
over the world.

1257
01:01:03.616 --> 01:01:06.227
He met Captains and their crews.

1258
01:01:07.533 --> 01:01:11.015
He insists that one time
during a full moon--

1259
01:01:11.058 --> 01:01:14.366
- In 1965. he spied a
Russian submarine.

1260
01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:17.325
Heard it!

1261
01:01:18.631 --> 01:01:21.373
- Look Auggie. I'm sorry
I can't provide you

1262
01:01:21.416 --> 01:01:24.550
with any new
information about Keeper.

1263
01:01:25.943 --> 01:01:28.728
- I'm sure August
appreciates your time

1264
01:01:28.772 --> 01:01:32.079
and for being a good
friend to Keeper.

1265
01:01:32.123 --> 01:01:33.124
- Yes. I do.

1266
01:01:35.866 --> 01:01:37.345
Thank you. Martha.

1267
01:01:38.782 --> 01:01:40.871
It's just that. well.

1268
01:01:40.914 --> 01:01:44.918
last night. I came across
these at Keepers cabin.

1269
01:01:48.661 --> 01:01:50.532
- They're theater tickets.

1270
01:01:50.576 --> 01:01:52.186
Unused.

1271
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:55.537
- For the opening night of
every city I've ever played.

1272
01:01:55.581 --> 01:01:57.583
- It was nice of you
to invite him.

1273
01:01:57.626 --> 01:02:00.151
- That's just it. I didn't.

1274
01:02:00.194 --> 01:02:01.630
- How do you think he got them?

1275
01:02:01.674 --> 01:02:03.415
- I don't know.

1276
01:02:03.458 --> 01:02:05.547
I don't mean to brag but.

1277
01:02:05.591 --> 01:02:08.289
most of these tickets
sold for a small fortune.

1278
01:02:08.333 --> 01:02:10.465
- I can see that.

1279
01:02:10.509 --> 01:02:11.902
- Martha. did Keeper ever
mention anything

1280
01:02:11.945 --> 01:02:13.686
to you about tickets?

1281
01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:16.907
- Not specifically.

1282
01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:18.430
- What do you mean. "not
specifically?"

1283
01:02:18.473 --> 01:02:21.389
- I mean. he never
mentioned tickets.

1284
01:02:21.433 --> 01:02:23.696
but he did always know
where you were.

1285
01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.350
what show you were in.

1286
01:02:25.393 --> 01:02:28.353
and how well you did
in the reviews.

1287
01:02:29.441 --> 01:02:31.051
- Power of the internet.

1288
01:02:31.095 --> 01:02:32.444
- Right.

1289
01:02:32.487 --> 01:02:34.054
The internet.

1290
01:02:34.098 --> 01:02:35.273
Keeper?

1291
01:02:35.316 --> 01:02:38.015
The closest he ever got
to a computer

1292
01:02:38.058 --> 01:02:41.105
was the timer on his
coffee maker.

1293
01:02:41.148 --> 01:02:44.238
And it usually started brewing
at three in the morning.

1294
01:02:44.282 --> 01:02:46.893
No. the net Keeper ever knew was

1295
01:02:48.025 --> 01:02:49.853
on a fishing boat.

1296
01:02:49.896 --> 01:02:52.333
- Well. then I guess
the case of the

1297
01:02:52.377 --> 01:02:56.076
unused theater tickets
will remain a mystery.

1298
01:02:59.732 --> 01:03:00.559
Who cares.

1299
01:03:02.082 --> 01:03:04.389
- It would seem that you do.

1300
01:03:08.219 --> 01:03:11.570
This place has the best
blueberry pie.

1301
01:03:11.613 --> 01:03:14.878
Are you sure you two
don't want a piece?

1302
01:03:17.097 --> 01:03:20.579
Have you tried contacting
Keeper's sister?

1303
01:03:21.928 --> 01:03:22.755
- What?

1304
01:03:24.713 --> 01:03:25.627
- [Martha] Keepers sister.

1305
01:03:25.671 --> 01:03:27.978
To shed light on the tickets.

1306
01:03:29.283 --> 01:03:31.590
- Martha. what are you
talking about?

1307
01:03:31.633 --> 01:03:33.679
- Keeper's sister.

1308
01:03:33.722 --> 01:03:35.855
You know. Auggie's mother.

1309
01:03:38.075 --> 01:03:39.032
- My mother?

1310
01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:45.212
- You didn't know that Keeper
is actually your Uncle.

1311
01:03:46.953 --> 01:03:47.780
did you?

1312
01:03:53.177 --> 01:03:54.743
More coffee please.

1313
01:04:02.969 --> 01:04:04.014
- [August] All right
Keeper of secrets.

1314
01:04:04.057 --> 01:04:04.841
you've got company.

1315
01:04:04.884 --> 01:04:05.842
- Sir!

1316
01:04:05.885 --> 01:04:07.104
Please sign in.

1317
01:04:08.757 --> 01:04:10.020
- When you sleep 20 hours a day

1318
01:04:10.063 --> 01:04:12.196
what's 15 minutes of lost rest?

1319
01:04:12.239 --> 01:04:12.849
Right?

1320
01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:15.286
All right. let's really
test your memory

1321
01:04:15.329 --> 01:04:18.811
and see what lies you
can muster this time.

1322
01:04:21.335 --> 01:04:22.119
[door knocking]

1323
01:04:22.162 --> 01:04:23.816
Keeper. it's August!

1324
01:04:30.344 --> 01:04:33.217
[slow paced music]

1325
01:05:17.478 --> 01:05:18.305
Keeper!

1326
01:05:25.095 --> 01:05:25.878
Keeper?

1327
01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:27.532
- Huh?

1328
01:05:27.575 --> 01:05:28.881
- Keeper. is that you?

1329
01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:30.404
- Auggie?

1330
01:05:30.448 --> 01:05:31.275
Watch out for the pirate.

1331
01:05:31.318 --> 01:05:32.406
- Pirate--

1332
01:05:32.450 --> 01:05:36.976
[hammer thudding]
[August grunting]

1333
01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:39.979
[thunder crackling]

1334
01:05:41.589 --> 01:05:43.548
- Auggie. hurry it up!

1335
01:05:43.591 --> 01:05:44.766
Time is short!

1336
01:05:44.810 --> 01:05:46.594
- [Auggie] I hate this place.

1337
01:05:46.638 --> 01:05:49.380
- And here comes the
next big thing.

1338
01:05:49.423 --> 01:05:51.164
August Star.

1339
01:05:51.208 --> 01:05:53.384
Remember. what's hot today

1340
01:05:53.427 --> 01:05:56.953
can just as easily become
what's not. tomorrow.

1341
01:05:56.996 --> 01:05:58.737
- If there is any time you could

1342
01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:00.434
come to visit your father.

1343
01:06:00.478 --> 01:06:03.046
I would recommend you do it now.

1344
01:06:03.089 --> 01:06:05.309
Owl's Point is sort
of a roundabout

1345
01:06:05.352 --> 01:06:07.050
way to Hollywood.
wouldn't you say.

1346
01:06:07.093 --> 01:06:10.531
Tell me August the Star.
what's out there?

1347
01:06:12.577 --> 01:06:14.840
What's out there that
can't be found right?

1348
01:06:14.883 --> 01:06:16.015
- What's real?

1349
01:06:17.408 --> 01:06:20.672
Real is what you
pretend real to be.

1350
01:06:20.715 --> 01:06:22.761
- I don't know you.

1351
01:06:22.804 --> 01:06:24.371
That's not my son.

1352
01:06:24.415 --> 01:06:25.416
What did he tell you!

1353
01:06:25.459 --> 01:06:26.591
Get him out of here!

1354
01:06:26.634 --> 01:06:29.115
- Keeper does remember you.
Auggie.

1355
01:06:29.159 --> 01:06:32.075
But to him you're a teenager.

1356
01:06:32.118 --> 01:06:33.728
Sometimes you have to
be uncomfortable

1357
01:06:33.772 --> 01:06:35.165
to be comfortable.

1358
01:06:35.208 --> 01:06:37.297
- You were thinking about
your Mother. but she--

1359
01:06:37.341 --> 01:06:38.124
- I hate her.

1360
01:06:38.168 --> 01:06:39.952
- You won't find him here.

1361
01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:40.779
- Why not?

1362
01:06:40.822 --> 01:06:43.434
- Auggie hates this place.

1363
01:06:43.477 --> 01:06:45.131
- Keeper's sister.

1364
01:06:45.175 --> 01:06:47.307
You know. Auggie's Mother.

1365
01:06:49.527 --> 01:06:51.485
- [August] My Mother?

1366
01:06:51.529 --> 01:06:54.227
[August coughing]

1367
01:06:54.271 --> 01:06:55.228
Ow. my head.

1368
01:06:56.708 --> 01:06:57.926
- Auggie?

1369
01:06:57.970 --> 01:06:59.624
Auggie is that you?

1370
01:06:59.667 --> 01:07:00.842
- Where are we?

1371
01:07:00.886 --> 01:07:02.279
- The lighthouse.

1372
01:07:03.715 --> 01:07:08.328
Red skies in the morning.
sailors take warning.

1373
01:07:08.372 --> 01:07:10.939
There's a storm a coming.

1374
01:07:10.983 --> 01:07:13.029
- I think it already hit.

1375
01:07:14.552 --> 01:07:16.423
- Those pirate friends of yours.

1376
01:07:16.467 --> 01:07:18.338
they play a little rough.

1377
01:07:18.382 --> 01:07:19.165
- Pirates?

1378
01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:23.300
- Not very creative though.

1379
01:07:23.343 --> 01:07:26.172
The best they could
come up with to say was.

1380
01:07:26.216 --> 01:07:27.608
"Where's the loot?

1381
01:07:27.652 --> 01:07:29.219
"Where's the loot?"

1382
01:07:30.829 --> 01:07:32.091
- Where are they?

1383
01:07:32.135 --> 01:07:34.528
- Well. I told them
where the loot was.

1384
01:07:34.572 --> 01:07:35.486
- Where?

1385
01:07:35.529 --> 01:07:36.922
- Where else?

1386
01:07:36.965 --> 01:07:38.706
In my treasure chest.

1387
01:07:42.667 --> 01:07:44.321
- Hey. what is this?

1388
01:07:48.934 --> 01:07:51.589
- It's kind of a dumb thing

1389
01:07:51.632 --> 01:07:54.026
to scavenger for though.

1390
01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:56.681
I can't remember the
last time I played it.

1391
01:07:56.724 --> 01:07:57.725
- Your lute.

1392
01:07:58.596 --> 01:07:59.945
- [Both Men] Oh!

1393
01:08:01.207 --> 01:08:01.990
- [August] Sorry.

1394
01:08:02.034 --> 01:08:04.210
- Auggie. are you okay?

1395
01:08:04.254 --> 01:08:06.299
- Why are you calling me Auggie?

1396
01:08:06.343 --> 01:08:08.040
- Well that's your name.

1397
01:08:08.084 --> 01:08:11.043
Are we being some kind
of characters?

1398
01:08:11.087 --> 01:08:12.349
Sir Francis Drake?

1399
01:08:13.698 --> 01:08:17.397
Sir Walter Raleigh how
can I be your service.

1400
01:08:19.138 --> 01:08:20.748
- No. Auggie's fine.

1401
01:08:20.792 --> 01:08:22.750
- Okay. as you wish sir.

1402
01:08:27.799 --> 01:08:29.017
- Dad.

1403
01:08:29.061 --> 01:08:30.541
- Huh?

1404
01:08:30.584 --> 01:08:31.803
- What happens when the
pirates figure out

1405
01:08:31.846 --> 01:08:34.066
that the loot is your lute?

1406
01:08:35.546 --> 01:08:36.590
- Well. they.

1407
01:08:37.548 --> 01:08:39.724
they said something about

1408
01:08:39.767 --> 01:08:42.727
coming back here to
finish the game.

1409
01:08:43.597 --> 01:08:44.990
I wish they would hurry.

1410
01:08:45.033 --> 01:08:47.035
It's cold. cold in here.

1411
01:08:48.559 --> 01:08:49.995
I'm tired.

1412
01:08:50.038 --> 01:08:51.344
- Hey. hang in there Dad.

1413
01:08:51.388 --> 01:08:53.346
- [Keeper] I'm so tired.

1414
01:08:58.438 --> 01:09:02.355
- It's been a long time
since I've been up there.

1415
01:09:02.399 --> 01:09:03.269
- Up where?

1416
01:09:04.618 --> 01:09:06.011
- The lantern room.

1417
01:09:06.054 --> 01:09:06.794
- Oh.

1418
01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:11.451
Not a big fan of
lighthouses. are you Auggie?

1419
01:09:11.495 --> 01:09:12.713
- I wouldn't say that.

1420
01:09:12.757 --> 01:09:13.584
- I would.

1421
01:09:14.628 --> 01:09:15.629
- [August] Well. it doesn't help

1422
01:09:15.673 --> 01:09:18.284
when you have a fear of heights.

1423
01:09:18.328 --> 01:09:19.981
- A fear of heights?

1424
01:09:20.895 --> 01:09:22.593
I never knew that.

1425
01:09:22.636 --> 01:09:24.334
- Yeah. I should have
told you earlier.

1426
01:09:24.377 --> 01:09:26.336
- Well. it doesn't matter.
does it?

1427
01:09:26.379 --> 01:09:27.163
- It does when you're supposed

1428
01:09:27.206 --> 01:09:29.295
to be a lighthouse keeper.

1429
01:09:29.339 --> 01:09:31.036
- Yeah. but.

1430
01:09:31.079 --> 01:09:33.778
you're never gonna be a
lighthouse keeper

1431
01:09:33.821 --> 01:09:35.083
are you Auggie?

1432
01:09:36.607 --> 01:09:37.434
- No Dad.

1433
01:09:39.479 --> 01:09:40.828
- Well good.

1434
01:09:40.872 --> 01:09:44.484
You have to follow your
dreams for your life.

1435
01:09:45.659 --> 01:09:47.879
not someone else's.

1436
01:09:47.922 --> 01:09:49.141
- My life?

1437
01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:49.924
- Yeah.

1438
01:09:50.882 --> 01:09:53.406
What is it you wanna do again?

1439
01:09:53.450 --> 01:09:54.755
- Act.

1440
01:09:54.799 --> 01:09:56.844
- Oh. that's right.

1441
01:09:56.888 --> 01:09:59.325
Well. [heavy breathing]

1442
01:09:59.369 --> 01:10:03.547
you were pretty good in
that last play of yours.

1443
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:04.417
- Really?

1444
01:10:04.461 --> 01:10:05.766
- Oh yeah. yeah.

1445
01:10:06.898 --> 01:10:08.073
I'll huff and I'll puff

1446
01:10:08.116 --> 01:10:11.381
and I'll blow your house down.

1447
01:10:11.424 --> 01:10:13.470
By golly. Auggie you did.

1448
01:10:14.862 --> 01:10:16.037
- Fifth grade.

1449
01:10:17.343 --> 01:10:18.910
Thanks.

1450
01:10:18.953 --> 01:10:22.043
- Auggie. there's one thing
you have to promise me.

1451
01:10:22.087 --> 01:10:23.523
- What's that?

1452
01:10:23.567 --> 01:10:26.134
- No matter where you go.

1453
01:10:26.178 --> 01:10:28.746
Auggie take the light with you.

1454
01:10:30.748 --> 01:10:32.837
- How is that even possible?

1455
01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:35.100
- Oh Auggie. all things are.

1456
01:10:36.275 --> 01:10:39.496
all things are
possible through Him.

1457
01:10:39.539 --> 01:10:41.411
who gives us strength.

1458
01:10:41.454 --> 01:10:43.369
- Even raising a kid
all by yourself?

1459
01:10:43.413 --> 01:10:45.284
- Well. I'm trying.

1460
01:10:45.328 --> 01:10:47.460
- You're doing a good job.

1461
01:10:50.768 --> 01:10:51.595
Hey.

1462
01:10:54.337 --> 01:10:57.557
what can you tell me
about your sister?

1463
01:10:59.864 --> 01:11:02.170
- Beautiful. beautiful girl.

1464
01:11:03.215 --> 01:11:04.042
Beautiful.

1465
01:11:05.783 --> 01:11:08.307
You know. my parents. after me.

1466
01:11:10.483 --> 01:11:13.617
I think they decided to
call it quits.

1467
01:11:16.446 --> 01:11:18.709
But eventually. I
guess they forgot

1468
01:11:18.752 --> 01:11:20.885
about all the trouble I was

1469
01:11:22.190 --> 01:11:25.629
and 16 years later. if you
can believe it.

1470
01:11:27.370 --> 01:11:28.675
along came Lily.

1471
01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:33.419
- Lily?

1472
01:11:33.463 --> 01:11:34.290
- Yeah.

1473
01:11:36.335 --> 01:11:37.945
- Where is she?

1474
01:11:37.989 --> 01:11:40.600
- Well. Lily herself in trouble.

1475
01:11:42.341 --> 01:11:45.823
She [Keeper coughing].

1476
01:11:45.866 --> 01:11:47.390
she made a mistake.

1477
01:11:48.608 --> 01:11:50.262
- Am I that mistake?

1478
01:11:52.743 --> 01:11:54.310
- No.

1479
01:11:54.353 --> 01:11:55.615
No.

1480
01:11:55.659 --> 01:11:56.877
You are my son.

1481
01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:03.319
Oh Auggie. I'm so tired.

1482
01:12:04.407 --> 01:12:05.408
- Stay with me Dad.

1483
01:12:05.451 --> 01:12:07.105
- So tired.

1484
01:12:07.148 --> 01:12:08.062
- Hey. Dad.

1485
01:12:09.281 --> 01:12:10.500
You remember this one?

1486
01:12:10.543 --> 01:12:11.631

- Rhonda?

1525
01:13:33.713 --> 01:13:34.540
What's going on?

1526
01:13:34.584 --> 01:13:35.541
- FBI.

1527
01:13:35.585 --> 01:13:36.847
- Thank God you're alive.

1528
01:13:36.890 --> 01:13:38.326
- How'd you find us?

1529
01:13:38.370 --> 01:13:41.242
- Well. brains don't exactly
run in Tony's family.

1530
01:13:41.286 --> 01:13:43.984
When the FBI went to
your Dad's house.

1531
01:13:44.028 --> 01:13:46.726
they found us and the car
in the driveway.

1532
01:13:46.770 --> 01:13:48.032
- And then you came here?

1533
01:13:48.075 --> 01:13:49.555
- No. the nursing home.

1534
01:13:49.599 --> 01:13:52.079
That little lighthouse lamp
you left in the window.

1535
01:13:52.123 --> 01:13:53.080
it was an awesome clue.

1536
01:13:53.124 --> 01:13:54.691
That was really great thinking.

1537
01:13:54.734 --> 01:13:57.650
- I didn't leave a lamp
in the window.

1538
01:13:57.694 --> 01:13:59.609
- He's burning up!
[Keeper groans]

1539
01:13:59.652 --> 01:14:00.436
- Auggie.

1540
01:14:01.654 --> 01:14:02.438
- Yeah.

1541
01:14:03.439 --> 01:14:04.701
- [Keeper] Is the game over?

1542
01:14:04.744 --> 01:14:05.876
- Yeah.

1543
01:14:05.919 --> 01:14:06.746
It's over.

1544
01:14:09.706 --> 01:14:10.837
- Who are you?

1545
01:14:12.535 --> 01:14:13.971
Where's Auggie!

1546
01:14:14.014 --> 01:14:16.321
- Let's get him out of here.

1547
01:14:22.283 --> 01:14:23.850
- The game is over.

1548
01:14:24.808 --> 01:14:26.636
- Not quite yet.

1549
01:14:26.679 --> 01:14:27.898
- Excuse me?

1550
01:14:27.941 --> 01:14:31.118
- Mr. Star. I have some
questions for you.

1551
01:14:31.162 --> 01:14:32.380
- Like?

1552
01:14:32.424 --> 01:14:35.471
- Like. for instance.
where are they?

1553
01:14:35.514 --> 01:14:36.907
- Where are what?

1554
01:14:38.778 --> 01:14:40.388
- The diamonds?

1555
01:14:40.432 --> 01:14:41.346
- Diamonds?

1556
01:14:53.358 --> 01:14:54.490
- What's going on over there?

1557
01:14:54.533 --> 01:14:55.447
- I don't know.

1558
01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:56.840
Some sort of interrogation?

1559
01:14:56.883 --> 01:15:01.497
- All right. let's calmly
try to go over this all.

1560
01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:03.020
- One more time.

1561
01:15:03.063 --> 01:15:05.065
We've been at this for hours.

1562
01:15:05.109 --> 01:15:08.068
We've searched the house.
Keeper's room.

1563
01:15:08.112 --> 01:15:10.201
the car. the lighthouse.

1564
01:15:10.244 --> 01:15:11.985
I have no idea where
the diamonds are!

1565
01:15:12.029 --> 01:15:14.466
- Mr. Star. if you
refuse to cooperate.

1566
01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:16.512
we'll just take you in
for further questioning.

1567
01:15:16.555 --> 01:15:17.338
- What?

1568
01:15:17.382 --> 01:15:18.688
Arrest me?

1569
01:15:18.731 --> 01:15:20.167
I'm a victim in all of this!

1570
01:15:20.211 --> 01:15:21.865
- The diamonds were in
your possession

1571
01:15:21.908 --> 01:15:23.040
when they disappeared.

1572
01:15:23.083 --> 01:15:25.085
- What do you mean.
"Disappeared?"

1573
01:15:25.129 --> 01:15:26.304
How can something disappear

1574
01:15:26.347 --> 01:15:28.088
that I never saw in
the first place?

1575
01:15:28.132 --> 01:15:29.481
- How convenient.

1576
01:15:29.525 --> 01:15:32.397
- Look. this is all a
big misunderstanding.

1577
01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:35.792
Why would I drive a car
full of hot diamonds

1578
01:15:35.835 --> 01:15:36.619
all the way to--

1579
01:15:36.662 --> 01:15:37.271
- Las Vegas!

1580
01:15:37.315 --> 01:15:38.664
- Vegas!

1581
01:15:38.708 --> 01:15:40.666
- So you admit you were
headed to Las Vegas?

1582
01:15:40.710 --> 01:15:42.276
- Yes. to deliver the car.

1583
01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:43.277
- With the diamonds.

1584
01:15:43.321 --> 01:15:44.714
- What diamonds?

1585
01:15:44.757 --> 01:15:46.629
- So you didn't go to Vegas?

1586
01:15:46.672 --> 01:15:47.630
- That's right.

1587
01:15:47.673 --> 01:15:48.544
- That was your mistake August!

1588
01:15:48.587 --> 01:15:50.589
The plan was to go to Vegas!

1589
01:15:50.633 --> 01:15:51.416
- The plan?

1590
01:15:51.459 --> 01:15:52.243
- There was--

1591
01:15:52.286 --> 01:15:53.113
- I see.

1592
01:15:53.157 --> 01:15:54.027
- There was no plan.

1593
01:15:54.071 --> 01:15:55.159
- Yes there was!

1594
01:15:55.202 --> 01:15:56.813
My cousin's plan!

1595
01:15:56.856 --> 01:15:58.945
Which obviously neither August

1596
01:15:58.989 --> 01:16:01.557
nor I had any part in planning.

1597
01:16:03.036 --> 01:16:04.690
I mean. just the execution.

1598
01:16:04.734 --> 01:16:06.039
- The execution?

1599
01:16:06.910 --> 01:16:07.737
I see.

1600
01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:09.521
- I see. you see nothing!

1601
01:16:09.565 --> 01:16:11.001
Tony!

1602
01:16:11.044 --> 01:16:12.480
Stop talking!

1603
01:16:12.524 --> 01:16:14.221
- Maybe you both should
stop talking.

1604
01:16:14.265 --> 01:16:16.484
At least until an
attorney is present.

1605
01:16:16.528 --> 01:16:17.660
I'll call Bernie.

1606
01:16:17.703 --> 01:16:20.358
- Bernie is an
entertainment lawyer.

1607
01:16:20.401 --> 01:16:23.274
We're not negotiating a
three picture deal here.

1608
01:16:23.317 --> 01:16:25.972
- Wait a minute. this
would make a great movie.

1609
01:16:26.016 --> 01:16:28.279
Whatever you do. do not
surrender the story rights.

1610
01:16:28.322 --> 01:16:29.759
- Hold on!

1611
01:16:29.802 --> 01:16:30.890
This is my story too. I
set the whole thing up!

1612
01:16:30.934 --> 01:16:33.980
- You heard him. he
just confessed.

1613
01:16:34.024 --> 01:16:34.633
Lock him up.

1614
01:16:34.677 --> 01:16:36.026
- Did not Rhonda!

1615
01:16:36.069 --> 01:16:37.941
You just wanna keep me
from a producers credit!

1616
01:16:37.984 --> 01:16:39.116
- Producers credit?

1617
01:16:39.159 --> 01:16:40.334
The day you get a
producer's credit--

1618
01:16:40.378 --> 01:16:42.859
- Can everyone please
just settle down?

1619
01:16:42.902 --> 01:16:44.382
You're agitating the residents.

1620
01:16:44.425 --> 01:16:46.689
- Oh. no need to stop
on our account.

1621
01:16:46.732 --> 01:16:48.255
We haven't had so much fun since

1622
01:16:48.299 --> 01:16:51.607
Homer knocked off the
pharmacy on Mardi Gras night!

1623
01:16:51.650 --> 01:16:54.653
- It was not one of our
finest hours.

1624
01:16:55.611 --> 01:16:57.134
- Back to your game boys.

1625
01:16:57.177 --> 01:16:58.178
- Yes ma'am.

1626
01:17:03.923 --> 01:17:06.839
- Homer only got away
with a case of laxatives.

1627
01:17:06.883 --> 01:17:08.145
It's not as bad as it sounds.

1628
01:17:08.188 --> 01:17:09.842
- It's not bad if you
want wall to wall--

1629
01:17:09.886 --> 01:17:12.105
- Back to your game Winnie.

1630
01:17:15.021 --> 01:17:16.327
- Well. without the
jewels in hand.

1631
01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:18.155
we can't let you go
until it is proven

1632
01:17:18.198 --> 01:17:19.417
that there was no colluding.

1633
01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:20.244
- Colluding?

1634
01:17:20.287 --> 01:17:22.333
- Or obstruction.

1635
01:17:22.376 --> 01:17:23.203
Gentlemen.

1636
01:17:24.335 --> 01:17:25.902
- What are you doing?

1637
01:17:25.945 --> 01:17:27.251
- You have a right to

1821
01:27:19.103 --> 01:27:20.409
Welcome.

1822
01:27:20.452 --> 01:27:21.758
- Oh. thank you.

1823
01:27:23.063 --> 01:27:24.848
- August Star I presume?

1824
01:27:24.891 --> 01:27:27.067
- Yeah. August Star senior.

1825
01:27:28.068 --> 01:27:30.332
Not to be confused with my son.

1826
01:27:30.375 --> 01:27:31.898
August Star junior.

1827
01:27:31.942 --> 01:27:35.641
- Believe me. I'll never
confuse you and Auggie.

1828
01:27:35.685 --> 01:27:37.991
How 'bout I call you Keeper?

1829
01:27:39.776 --> 01:27:41.473
- Well. all my friends do.

1830
01:27:41.517 --> 01:27:43.780
- Well then it's appropriate.

1831
01:27:43.823 --> 01:27:45.869
Please. come in. sit down.

1832
01:27:45.912 --> 01:27:49.525
[speaking foreign language]

1833
01:28:01.928 --> 01:28:03.147
Would you like a cup of tea?

1834
01:28:03.190 --> 01:28:06.629
I have an Oolong that's
out of your world.

1835
01:28:07.847 --> 01:28:09.022
That's a joke.

1836
01:28:10.850 --> 01:28:13.592
- No. no tea for me. thank you.

1837
01:28:13.636 --> 01:28:16.203
- Keeper. do you know who I am?

1838
01:28:17.509 --> 01:28:19.250
- You are the Author?

1839
01:28:19.294 --> 01:28:20.120
- I am.

1840
01:28:23.123 --> 01:28:24.037
What is it?

1841
01:28:24.081 --> 01:28:26.910
- Well. it's just that you.

1842
01:28:26.953 --> 01:28:27.780
I mean...

1843
01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:30.914
Forgive me.

1844
01:28:31.828 --> 01:28:33.177
- I already have.

1845
01:28:34.396 --> 01:28:35.962
- Right. right.

1846
01:28:36.006 --> 01:28:37.616
It's just you're not--

1847
01:28:37.660 --> 01:28:41.707
- Oh. you were expecting
Charlton Heston?

1848
01:28:41.751 --> 01:28:43.709
I get that all the time.

1849
01:28:44.928 --> 01:28:46.408
August Star senior.

1850
01:28:47.887 --> 01:28:49.367
this is your life.

1851
01:28:53.066 --> 01:28:55.504
Or should I say was your life.

1852
01:28:58.724 --> 01:28:59.986
- Look. I wanna apologize.

1853
01:29:00.030 --> 01:29:00.900
- For what?

1854
01:29:00.944 --> 01:29:03.207
- For this. my life.

1855
01:29:03.250 --> 01:29:06.297
- It's too late for
apologies Keeper.

1856
01:29:08.952 --> 01:29:09.561
Keeper.

1857
01:29:11.171 --> 01:29:14.740
Do you really believe what
you said you believe is true?

1858
01:29:14.784 --> 01:29:15.393
- Yes.

1859
01:29:16.742 --> 01:29:20.267
- Come with me. I wanna
show you something.

1860
01:29:24.184 --> 01:29:25.011
Please.

1861
01:29:28.493 --> 01:29:32.149
- "In the beginning. God created
the Heaven and the Earth."

1862
01:29:32.192 --> 01:29:34.891
- Not a bad opening if I
do say so myself.

1863
01:29:34.934 --> 01:29:37.850
[Keeper chuckling]

1864
01:29:45.945 --> 01:29:47.207
- "For I know the
thoughts that I think

1865
01:29:47.251 --> 01:29:49.166
"toward you sayeth the Lord.

1866
01:29:49.209 --> 01:29:51.473
"Thought of peace and
not of evil."

1867
01:29:51.516 --> 01:29:54.737
- [Author] To give you
an expected end.

1868
01:30:05.661 --> 01:30:08.707
- [Keeper] "Fear thou
not. for I am with thee.

1869
01:30:08.751 --> 01:30:12.624
- [Author] "Be not
dismayed. for I am thy God."

1870
01:30:12.668 --> 01:30:14.234
- [Keeper And Author]
"I will strengthen thee.

1871
01:30:14.278 --> 01:30:15.540
"ye will help thee.

1872
01:30:15.584 --> 01:30:17.499
"Ye I will uphold thee

1873
01:30:17.542 --> 01:30:21.024
"with the right hand of my
righteousness."

1874
01:30:28.205 --> 01:30:29.554
- [Keeper] "And we know
that all things

1875
01:30:29.598 --> 01:30:32.601
"work together for good
to them that love God.

1876
01:30:32.644 --> 01:30:34.298
- "To them who are called.

1877
01:30:34.341 --> 01:30:36.561
"according to His purpose."

1878
01:30:40.783 --> 01:30:45.004
Every great story deserves
a hero. don't you agree?

1879
01:30:50.532 --> 01:30:52.577
- "For God so loved the world

1880
01:30:52.621 --> 01:30:55.580
"that He gave His only
begotten son.

1881
01:30:55.624 --> 01:30:58.888
"That whosoever believeth
in Him should not perish.

1882
01:30:58.931 --> 01:31:01.238
"but have everlasting life."

1883
01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:04.502
- Do you believe Keeper?

1884
01:31:04.546 --> 01:31:06.678
- I do. with all my heart.

1885
01:31:08.201 --> 01:31:09.594
- It is finished.

1886
01:31:11.335 --> 01:31:12.989
Welcome home Keeper.

1887
01:31:18.821 --> 01:31:20.387
This is the point
where new arrivals

1888
01:31:20.431 --> 01:31:23.826
usually show a little more
excitement to be here.

1889
01:31:23.869 --> 01:31:26.568
- Yes. I'm very
happy to be here.

1890
01:31:27.525 --> 01:31:28.221
- But.

1891
01:31:29.571 --> 01:31:33.183
- But I lived my entire
life on Owl's Point.

1892
01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:36.186
I should've been out and about

1893
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:38.841
telling other people this story.

1894
01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:43.019
- Let me show you
something else.

1895
01:31:45.151 --> 01:31:46.805
Keeper. do you know
what these are?

1896
01:31:46.849 --> 01:31:47.632
- Books?

1897
01:31:49.678 --> 01:31:51.506
- Each book is a life.

1898
01:31:52.898 --> 01:31:53.725
- Wow.

1899
01:31:55.379 --> 01:31:56.815
How do you keep 'em
all straight?

1900
01:31:56.859 --> 01:31:57.903
- God only knows.

1901
01:31:59.252 --> 01:32:03.648
Hey. you tossed me the
ball. I had to hit it.

1902
01:32:03.692 --> 01:32:06.433
Anyway Keeper. these
are stories.

1903
01:32:07.304 --> 01:32:08.131
Lives.

1904
01:32:09.393 --> 01:32:11.264
In which you have
been a character

1905
01:32:11.308 --> 01:32:12.831
of great influence.

1906
01:32:16.748 --> 01:32:17.706
- All these?

1907
01:32:17.749 --> 01:32:18.663
- Every one.

1908
01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:24.713
Your story has intersected each
and every life you see here.

1909
01:32:26.018 --> 01:32:29.631
Some of the meetings
you don't even recall.

1910
01:32:29.674 --> 01:32:33.548
Nevertheless. by your
example. a sentence. a deed.

1911
01:32:34.679 --> 01:32:36.768
You helped to write
a new chapter

1912
01:32:36.812 --> 01:32:38.727
in all of these stories.

1913
01:32:39.858 --> 01:32:41.556
You helped to write
events that have

1914
01:32:41.599 --> 01:32:43.906
and continue to bring people

1915
01:32:45.124 --> 01:32:46.996
through that very door.

1916
01:32:49.215 --> 01:32:51.174
Keeper. you have
helped the light

1917
01:32:51.217 --> 01:32:53.132
to pierce the darkness

1918
01:32:53.176 --> 01:32:55.526
and guide many through the storm

1919
01:32:55.570 --> 01:32:58.573
far above your duties
at Owl's Point.

1920
01:32:59.965 --> 01:33:00.792
Well done.

1921
01:33:02.185 --> 01:33:03.795
- What about Auggie?

1922
01:33:05.101 --> 01:33:08.539
- Your sons story is
not yet complete.

1923
01:33:08.583 --> 01:33:11.542
There are many
chapters yet to come.

1924
01:33:16.634 --> 01:33:17.592
I can't tell you the ending.

1925
01:33:17.635 --> 01:33:19.071
that would be a spoiler.

1926
01:33:19.115 --> 01:33:21.117
- I wouldn't mind.

1927
01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:24.120
- Well. what I can tell you

1928
01:33:24.163 --> 01:33:27.863
is that the fire you helped
to kindle in Auggie's life

1929
01:33:27.906 --> 01:33:29.647
will continue to burn.

1930
01:33:31.301 --> 01:33:33.303
Your work is done.

1931
01:33:33.346 --> 01:33:34.652
- That's what worries me.

1932
01:33:34.696 --> 01:33:37.350
[bell ringing]

1933
01:33:37.394 --> 01:33:38.874
- No worries here.

1934
01:33:40.049 --> 01:33:42.617
Auggie is in good hands.

1935
01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:45.620
Now. how would you like
to take a little tour?

1936
01:33:45.663 --> 01:33:47.056
- Sure.

1937
01:33:47.099 --> 01:33:48.448
- [Author] Michael here
will show you the ropes.

1938
01:33:48.492 --> 01:33:49.580
- [Keeper] Mike!

1939
01:33:49.624 --> 01:33:52.017
- Good to see you Keeper.

1940
01:33:52.061 --> 01:33:54.019
- Is he dead too?

1941
01:33:54.063 --> 01:33:55.717
- Well. I. sort of work here.

1942
01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:57.283
Come on. I've got a
lot to show you.

1943
01:33:57.327 --> 01:33:59.068
- This place is full
of surprises.

1944
01:33:59.111 --> 01:34:00.809
- [Mike] You have no idea.

1945
01:34:00.852 --> 01:34:01.897
- Wait. wait.

1946
01:34:03.768 --> 01:34:04.595
Thank you.

1947
01:34:06.075 --> 01:34:08.730
- I'll see you at dinner.

1948
01:34:08.773 --> 01:34:09.600
And

1949
01:34:10.688 --> 01:34:11.994
try the lasagna.

1950
01:34:13.169 --> 01:34:15.388
- Oh. this really is heaven.

1951
01:34:16.476 --> 01:34:19.175
Come on. what are we
waiting for?

1952
01:34:47.116 --> 01:34:48.247
- I sent them.

1953
01:34:53.383 --> 01:34:57.343
An opening night ticket
for each and every city.

1954
01:34:59.215 --> 01:35:01.130
- I always wondered
why there was

1955
01:35:01.173 --> 01:35:04.046
an empty seat third row center.

1956
01:35:04.089 --> 01:35:06.309
- He was very proud
of you August.

1957
01:35:06.352 --> 01:35:07.136
He loved you like a--

1958
01:35:07.179 --> 01:35:08.006
- A son?

1959
01:35:10.748 --> 01:35:13.708
Did you love me like a son too.
Mom?

1960
01:35:26.024 --> 01:35:28.244
- I was 17 and alone.

1961
01:35:28.287 --> 01:35:31.290
I knew you were in good hands.

1962
01:35:31.334 --> 01:35:34.685
After all. he was the 5th
generation of Keepers.

1963
01:35:34.729 --> 01:35:36.339
and he needed a noble heir.

1964
01:35:36.382 --> 01:35:38.036
- I was a disappointment to him.

1965
01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:40.865
- No August. you gave
him purpose.

1966
01:35:42.432 --> 01:35:44.826
The light he cared about
was never this old thing.

1967
01:35:44.869 --> 01:35:45.740
It was you.

1968
01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:48.743
- And the Word.

1969
01:35:49.874 --> 01:35:52.181
I sort of turned that switch off

1970
01:35:52.224 --> 01:35:53.704
after I left here.

1971
01:35:55.227 --> 01:35:57.186
- He thought we might...

1972
01:36:00.537 --> 01:36:03.061
After a lot of
trouble he found me.

1973
01:36:03.105 --> 01:36:06.151
He told me you had gone
off to follow your dream.

1974
01:36:06.195 --> 01:36:07.457
And he thought it might
be a good time

1975
01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:09.764
for me to reenter your life.

1976
01:36:09.807 --> 01:36:11.853
I didn't know how.

1977
01:36:11.896 --> 01:36:14.943
But I thought you might
need a manager.

1978
01:36:14.986 --> 01:36:17.728
I sat through 12 of your
performances in four cities

1979
01:36:17.772 --> 01:36:21.166
before I got up the nerve
to pitch to you.

1980
01:36:21.210 --> 01:36:23.865
- At least I know where
I got my acting chops.

1981
01:36:23.908 --> 01:36:26.171
- I can't tell you how many
times I wanted to tell you.

1982
01:36:26.215 --> 01:36:27.172
- The truth?

1983
01:36:28.695 --> 01:36:29.914
Why didn't you?

1984
01:36:33.048 --> 01:36:35.180
- I didn't wanna lose you.

1985
01:36:36.747 --> 01:36:38.053
I figured at least as
your manager

1986
01:36:38.096 --> 01:36:40.664
I could be a part of your life.

1987
01:36:49.716 --> 01:36:50.630
Am I fired?

1988
01:36:56.898 --> 01:36:57.724
- Yes.

1989
01:36:59.248 --> 01:37:00.292
You're fired.

1990
01:37:03.861 --> 01:37:05.602
As my manager.

1991
01:37:05.645 --> 01:37:07.386
but not as my Mother.

1992
01:37:08.997 --> 01:37:13.131
I've let too much come
between me and family.

1993
01:37:13.175 --> 01:37:14.480
But not anymore.

1994
01:37:16.091 --> 01:37:18.745
- Can I have you as a reference?

1995
01:37:32.542 --> 01:37:33.717
I think there's someone else

1996
01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:36.938

word with you.

[bell ringing]

1998
01:38:05.401 --> 01:38:07.751
- [August] I know one
thing's for sure.

1999
01:38:07.794 --> 01:38:09.013
- What's that?

2000
01:38:09.057 --> 01:38:11.146
- I will never again
think of Owl's Point

2001
01:38:11.189 --> 01:38:13.670
as a remote. out of the
way. hole in the wall.

2002
01:38:13.713 --> 01:38:16.107
where nothing exciting
ever happens.

2003
01:38:16.151 --> 01:38:17.195
- Told ya so.

2004
01:38:17.239 --> 01:38:18.675
- You did.

2005
01:38:18.718 --> 01:38:19.937
You told me a lot.

2006
01:38:19.981 --> 01:38:21.852
- Sorry. I can be sort
of opinionated.

2007
01:38:21.896 --> 01:38:22.984
- That's a good thing.

2008
01:38:23.027 --> 01:38:24.942
- Not every time.

2009
01:38:24.986 --> 01:38:26.552
- Mandy. thank you.

2010
01:38:29.164 --> 01:38:32.123
You never gave up on Keeper.

2011
01:38:32.167 --> 01:38:32.950
Or me.

2012
01:38:35.170 --> 01:38:36.998
- Well. I've learned that

2013
01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:40.001
just because two people
can't talk to each other

2014
01:38:40.044 --> 01:38:44.222
doesn't mean they can't
still listen to each other.

2015
01:38:46.007 --> 01:38:49.053
Besides. it was good
training for me.

2016
01:38:50.272 --> 01:38:51.142
- Training?

2017
01:38:53.362 --> 01:38:56.017
- I think I'm gonna have
another wanderer on my hands

2018
01:38:56.060 --> 01:38:58.541
in the not too distant future.

2019
01:39:00.673 --> 01:39:05.591
- With your love. she'll
always find her way home.

2020
01:39:05.635 --> 01:39:07.028
- That's my part.

2021
01:39:10.509 --> 01:39:13.121
So. what's next for August Star?

2022
01:39:14.078 --> 01:39:15.123
- About that.

2023
01:39:16.994 --> 01:39:19.040
I've never been so uncertain.

2024
01:39:19.083 --> 01:39:20.911
- I bet for a control
freak that's kind of scary.

2025
01:39:20.955 --> 01:39:21.999
- Real scary.

2026
01:39:25.176 --> 01:39:25.960
- Well.

2027
01:39:29.050 --> 01:39:32.967
I've learned that whenever
I'm the most uncertain.

2028
01:39:33.010 --> 01:39:36.057
the answer is usually
right around the corner.

2029
01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:38.363
- That's what you found?

2030
01:39:38.407 --> 01:39:39.190
- Yeah.

2031
01:39:45.501 --> 01:39:48.373
- Well. I guess I
should get going.

2032
01:39:51.463 --> 01:39:52.290
- I guess.

2033
01:39:54.858 --> 01:39:56.251
- Mandy. could you do me a favor

2034
01:39:56.294 --> 01:39:58.122
and thank Mike for me?

2035
01:39:58.166 --> 01:39:59.471
I know how much he
meant to Keeper.

2036
01:39:59.515 --> 01:40:00.777
- Mike?

2037
01:40:00.820 --> 01:40:04.520
- Mike. Keeper's
caregiver at Owl's Nest.

2038
01:40:04.563 --> 01:40:07.436
- Auggie. we don't have a
Mike on staff.

2039
01:40:07.479 --> 01:40:10.439
But I mean. I can always
check one of the volunteers--

2040
01:40:10.482 --> 01:40:11.483
- Nevermind.

2041
01:40:12.919 --> 01:40:14.878
You know actors. sometimes
we have trouble

2042
01:40:14.921 --> 01:40:17.533
separating fantasy from reality.

2043
01:40:18.708 --> 01:40:20.536
You're real aren't you?

2044
01:40:20.579 --> 01:40:22.016
- Last I checked.

2045
01:40:29.632 --> 01:40:30.459
- Well.

2046
01:40:32.809 --> 01:40:34.811
I guess this is goodbye.

2047
01:40:36.769 --> 01:40:38.597
- Goodbye August Star.

2048
01:40:49.695 --> 01:40:53.177

be your best chapter.
