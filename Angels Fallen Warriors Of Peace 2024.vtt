I know everything
about you. Gabriel.

Born to Thomas and
Martha. B average student.

building and fixing things.

joined the Marines
straight out of high school

212
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:08.710
and served until they
left Iraq in 2011.

213
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:10.750
Then you took your
knack for fixing things

214
00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:14.850
and your lack of ambition.
and now you're working here.

this very conversation. doubted

219
00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.850

and his legion of demons.

Even if this was true. why me?

you wish you could take back?

Something that haunts you
at night to this very day?

235

What would I have to do?

238
00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:39.960
The archangel Michael has
closed the gates of hell.

239
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:44.610
and those lost souls
are trapped here.

240

He's using them to build an
army to rule over the living.

241
00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:52.490
If he is defeated. then the
gates of hell can reopen.

242
00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:56.680
Those lost souls can be
sent to where they belong.

01:36:15.950 --> 01:36:19.730
You will have your own circle
of hell to worry about.

1097
01:36:19.730 --> 01:36:23.330
My Lord. please.

1098
01:36:23.330 --> 01:36:24.150
It's not over.

1099
01:36:24.150 --> 01:36:25.610
I can still defeat them.

1100
01:36:25.610 --> 01:36:27.830
You had your chance.

1101
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:31.250
I knew I shouldn't
have trusted you.

1102
01:36:31.250 --> 01:36:33.680
That's twice you have failed.

1103
01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:36.750
There will not be a third time.

1104
01:36:36.750 --> 01:36:38.250
I'm an archangel.

1105
01:36:38.250 --> 01:36:41.680
I'm one of the most powerful
beings in the underworld.

1106
01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:44.600
Am I late to the party?

It's time. Michael.

1111
01:37:01.012 --> 01:37:03.422
I'll be seeing you again.

1112
01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:09.156
I'm not afraid.

1113
01:37:09.156 --> 01:37:09.990
We'll see.

1114
01:37:12.912 --> 01:37:15.280
Give the old man my regards.

1115
01:37:37.730 --> 01:37:41.420
So what now?

1116
01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:42.470
We go home.

1117
01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:44.650
You go home.

1118
01:37:44.650 --> 01:37:46.600
I've got nothing to go back to.

1119
01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:48.580
There are men down.

1120
01:37:48.580 --> 01:37:50.732
I'm staying.

1121
01:37:50.732 --> 01:37:51.690
What about your family?

1122
01:37:55.030 --> 01:37:56.025
This is my family now.

1123
01:38:00.220 --> 01:38:01.690
OK.

1124
01:38:01.690 --> 01:38:02.620
Thanks.

1125
01:38:02.620 --> 01:38:06.515
Not like we'll have much use
for one-handed warrior of piece.

1126
01:38:06.515 --> 01:38:07.765
Hey. man. it's just a scratch.

1127
01:38:10.530 --> 01:38:11.470
What do you mean?

1128
01:38:14.070 --> 01:38:15.960
Looks good. right?

1129
01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:16.720
Come on.

1130
01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:17.675
Do your magic thing.

1131
01:38:28.410 --> 01:38:29.015
Well done.

1132
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:37.470
I'm dead. aren't I?

1133
01:38:54.830 --> 01:38:55.935
You've always known.

1134
01:39:00.453 --> 01:39:01.495
I didn't want to believe.

1135
01:39:14.230 --> 01:39:16.640
I'm ready.

1136
01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:17.140

Are you Jasmine?

1139
01:40:00.150 --> 01:40:03.620
My parents say I'm not
supposed to talk to strangers.

1140
01:40:03.620 --> 01:40:05.480
Those are wise words to live by.

1141

But we came to give you a gift
from your neighbor. Gabriel.

Yes.

Wow.

Oh. my God.

Thank you so much.

1148

It's perfect.

1149

Do you like tea parties?

1150
01:40:27.770 --> 01:40:29.500
Yeah. more like I love them.
