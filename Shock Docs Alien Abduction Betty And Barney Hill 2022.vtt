3
00:00:08.206 --> 00:00:13.931
[narrator] It is the first and
most highly documented alien
abduction story ever told.

4
00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:21.241
Betty and Barney Hill.

5
00:00:21.275 --> 00:00:25.896
a couple in love were driving
back from their honeymoon...

6
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.793
when they were kidnapped
by a UFO.

7
00:00:38.137 --> 00:00:40.310
Now clasp your hands
in front of you.

8
00:00:40.344 --> 00:00:41.620
As they get tighter.
you're going to sleep.

9
00:00:41.655 --> 00:00:44.206
You're going to a deep.
deep sleep. Your eyes...

10
00:00:44.241 --> 00:00:46.758
[narrator] Rare interviews
under hypnosis.

11
00:00:46.793 --> 00:00:51.172
detail how alien beings
subjected the couple

12
00:00:51.206 --> 00:00:53.034
to disturbing experiments.

13
00:01:01.758 --> 00:01:03.413
[narrator]
Newly uncovered evidence

14
00:01:03.448 --> 00:01:07.137
and declassified government
documents confirm

15
00:01:07.172 --> 00:01:10.000
what happened to Betty
and Barney was real.

16
00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:17.620
[narrator] We are not alone.

17
00:01:17.655 --> 00:01:20.379
Extraterrestrials do exist.

18
00:01:23.137 --> 00:01:25.965
But what do they want from us?

19
00:01:52.551 --> 00:01:55.379
It was just an ordinary day
in America.

20
00:01:57.103 --> 00:02:02.241
Betty. a social worker and
Barney. a US postal employee

21
00:02:02.275 --> 00:02:06.275
were driving home after their
honeymoon in Niagara Falls.

22
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.413
A trip as their niece
Kathleen explains.

23
00:02:09.448 --> 00:02:12.068
they would never forget.

24
00:02:12.103 --> 00:02:15.068
Betty and Barney had
a wonderful time
in Niagara Falls.

25
00:02:19.034 --> 00:02:23.586
They spent the following
afternoon in Montreal.

26
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.172
They thought about spending
the night downtown.

27
00:02:27.206 --> 00:02:31.000
But they heard that there
was a hurricane
whirling up the coast.

28
00:02:32.206 --> 00:02:36.413
And they wanted to drive
through the night
if they could.

29
00:02:43.551 --> 00:02:48.448
I was 13 years old
and I had arrived home
from school in the afternoon.

30
00:02:53.206 --> 00:02:56.896
My mother was on the phone
with my aunt. Betty.

31
00:02:56.931 --> 00:03:01.413
And I heard my mother's side
of the conversation.

32
00:03:01.448 --> 00:03:04.000
When my mother hung up
the phone.

33
00:03:04.034 --> 00:03:06.931
she told me
that Betty and Barney

34
00:03:06.965 --> 00:03:11.344
had seen a flying saucer
up close the night before.

35
00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.724
they were concerned that they
might have been contaminated.

36
00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.482
I was in shock.

37
00:03:18.517 --> 00:03:21.172
I thought this was
very. very strange.

38
00:03:30.965 --> 00:03:33.758
[narrator]
This is a 1966 radio interview

39
00:03:33.793 --> 00:03:36.689
with Betty and Barney
in their own words.

40
00:03:37.482 --> 00:03:38.551
Now. as I understand it.

41
00:03:38.586 --> 00:03:41.034
we have to go back to 1961
to start this.

42
00:03:41.068 --> 00:03:43.103
this whole incident. don't we?

43
00:03:43.137 --> 00:03:46.068
Yes. that's right.
September 19th. 1961.

44
00:03:48.172 --> 00:03:51.965
[narrator] The night that
changed their lives forever.

45
00:04:56.103 --> 00:04:59.413
Betty had never seen
a satellite before.

46
00:04:59.448 --> 00:05:03.965
She knew that her father was
very interested in satellites.

47
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.655
And so. Betty wondered
could this be a satellite?

48
00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:12.000
But then. she thought.
no. it's not behaving
like a satellite.

49
00:05:14.758 --> 00:05:16.551
[Barney speaking]

50
00:05:26.517 --> 00:05:29.517
It's clear at this point.
this was not a satellite.

51
00:05:29.551 --> 00:05:31.379
It does a circle.

52
00:05:31.413 --> 00:05:36.068
It seems to fly away to the
west and then come back
directly towards them.

53
00:05:38.551 --> 00:05:41.344
Barney is coming up
with the other explanations.

54
00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:43.551
Maybe it's a passenger jet.

55
00:05:43.586 --> 00:05:45.862
Maybe it's a military
helicopter.

56
00:05:45.896 --> 00:05:50.103
He's got all these
explanations because
that's how he thinks.

57
00:06:23.965 --> 00:06:27.517
Privately. he knew
that this was unusual.

58
00:06:27.551 --> 00:06:33.000
But he said to Betty.
"Oh. it's just a piper cub
or a commercial airliner.

59
00:06:33.034 --> 00:06:37.103
Don't even think about that
and let's get home.

60
00:06:47.586 --> 00:06:50.310
[narrator] But then. as they
continue driving south.

61
00:06:50.344 --> 00:06:54.172
Betty notices the aircraft
appears to be stalking them.

62
00:06:55.793 --> 00:06:58.724
Betty said to Barney.
"It's coming closer. Barney."

63
00:06:58.758 --> 00:07:03.172
As they looked at it.
it flew in a zigzag pattern

64
00:07:03.206 --> 00:07:08.689
and then it appeared to bounce
back and forth in the sky
like a ping-pong ball.

65
00:07:11.068 --> 00:07:12.620
[narrator]
Barney starts to panic.

66
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.689
Up until now. the sighting
had been at quite a distance.

67
00:07:36.103 --> 00:07:40.413
But now that they've driven
down the road. several miles
and they look up.

68
00:07:41.206 --> 00:07:42.620
And it's still there.

69
00:07:43.724 --> 00:07:45.310
Fear starts to settle in.

70
00:07:46.517 --> 00:07:48.724
It knows that we're here.

71
00:07:48.758 --> 00:07:53.034
They're thinking this has
a particular interest in us.

72
00:07:53.068 --> 00:07:55.517
There's no other cars
on the highway.

73
00:07:55.551 --> 00:07:58.758
And this light is getting
brighter and it's getting
closer.

74
00:08:20.068 --> 00:08:22.000
[narrator]
The object. the metallic disc.

75
00:08:22.034 --> 00:08:24.413
the width and length
of a commercial airliner

76
00:08:24.448 --> 00:08:29.000
and as flat as a pancake
is now hovering over the road.

77
00:08:33.103 --> 00:08:37.172
Stunned and with nowhere
to go. Barney stops the car.

78
00:08:40.379 --> 00:08:44.241
Barney is now determined.
he's boiled over
not just with curiosity.

79
00:08:44.275 --> 00:08:47.103
but almost a sense of duty.

80
00:08:47.137 --> 00:08:48.862
I can't continue this trip

81
00:08:48.896 --> 00:08:52.620
until we get rid of this thing
or find out what it wants.

82
00:08:54.896 --> 00:08:56.758
So he gets out of the car

83
00:08:56.793 --> 00:08:59.482
and he starts walking
in the field to approach it.

84
00:09:01.379 --> 00:09:03.793
[Kathleen] Barney is
a confirmed skeptic.

85
00:09:05.379 --> 00:09:07.448
Barney does not believe

86
00:09:07.482 --> 00:09:14.137
that this planet could
possibly be visited by space
aliens from elsewhere.

87
00:09:36.896 --> 00:09:38.724
[narrator]
And then he sees them.

88
00:09:41.586 --> 00:09:45.275
Gray uniform
beings looking down.

89
00:09:46.758 --> 00:09:51.448
He sees occupants inside
of the craft. which is now
tilted towards him.

90
00:10:06.068 --> 00:10:09.103
[Kathleen] They're dressed
in shiny black uniforms.

91
00:10:10.965 --> 00:10:13.827
They were gray in complexion.

92
00:10:13.862 --> 00:10:16.758
They were completely hairless.

93
00:10:16.793 --> 00:10:20.068
They had eyes
that wrapped around

94
00:10:20.103 --> 00:10:24.517
to the sides of their faces
larger than human eyes.

95
00:10:26.965 --> 00:10:30.827
[Ben] We would describe
this as a Close Encounters
of the Third Kind.

96
00:10:30.862 --> 00:10:33.275
The witness is not just
seeing it at a distance.

97
00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:37.413
but they're actually seeing
occupants within the.
or outside of the craft.

98
00:10:39.448 --> 00:10:41.275
And windows are now visible

99
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:43.344
with the occupants
looking at Barney

100
00:10:43.379 --> 00:10:45.172
who's staring at them
through binoculars.

101
00:10:46.206 --> 00:10:47.310
There's a direct.

102
00:10:47.344 --> 00:10:53.068
it seems. communication
as if to say we came for you

103
00:10:53.103 --> 00:10:56.379
and we're not going to be
satisfied until we get
what we want.

104
00:11:16.586 --> 00:11:23.517
Little red lights started
to slide out from the craft
on fin-like structures.

105
00:11:23.551 --> 00:11:27.586
And something started to drop
down from the bottom
of the craft.

106
00:11:31.793 --> 00:11:37.068
[Ben] Suddenly. Barney sees
what appears to be a ramp
or a ladder.

107
00:11:37.103 --> 00:11:39.689
And now. it seems like
the craft is transforming

108
00:11:39.724 --> 00:11:41.689
as someone is planning
to come out.

109
00:11:54.655 --> 00:11:58.758
[narrator] Sensing danger.
Barney rushes back to the car.

110
00:11:58.793 --> 00:12:02.586
Barney somehow knew
that there was a plan

111
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:07.896
and that that plan
was to capture him
like. "a bug in a net."

112
00:12:07.931 --> 00:12:11.034
They had to get out of there
or they were going
to be captured.

113
00:12:24.758 --> 00:12:27.000
[narrator]
But it's already too late.

114
00:12:36.551 --> 00:12:40.172
[narrator] A close encounter
with a UFO sends Barney Hill

115
00:12:40.206 --> 00:12:42.275
and his wife. Betty.
into a panic.

116
00:12:46.413 --> 00:12:48.344
[Bryce] Betty and Barney
are now on the run.

117
00:12:48.379 --> 00:12:51.793
They know that something
is there that's not supposed
to be there.

118
00:12:51.827 --> 00:12:55.275
They know it's some kind
of flying saucer.

119
00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:58.275
They know that there are
creatures inside it.

120
00:13:32.413 --> 00:13:35.655
[narrator]
The beeps are unlike anything
they have ever heard.

121
00:13:46.413 --> 00:13:50.689
[narrator] Suddenly.
a tingling sensation comes
over both Betty and Barney.

122
00:13:59.931 --> 00:14:01.827
Then silence.

123
00:14:03.344 --> 00:14:06.689
As if suspended in a dream.

124
00:14:06.724 --> 00:14:09.586
[Kathleen] As if only a moment
had passed.

125
00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:14.586
Betty and Barney heard another
series of buzzing sounds.

126
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.931
This time.
they didn't see the craft.

127
00:14:16.965 --> 00:14:20.758
But it returned them
to full consciousness.

128
00:14:20.793 --> 00:14:25.241
And they realized that they
were 35 miles down the highway

129
00:14:25.275 --> 00:14:29.586
with very little memory
of what had occurred
in the interim.

130
00:14:58.758 --> 00:15:02.275
When people see extraordinary
things. they can often be
in denial.

131
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:05.827
You'd have to say that that
is possibly the case
with Barney Hill.

132
00:15:05.862 --> 00:15:09.620
He's still not believing it.
even though he's seen it
with his own eyes.

133
00:15:48.034 --> 00:15:51.172
[narrator]
After arriving home.
the Hills remain puzzled.

134
00:15:52.172 --> 00:15:55.000
They're both feeling
a little creeped out.

135
00:15:55.034 --> 00:15:57.896
You know how you feel grimy
after a long trip?

136
00:15:57.931 --> 00:16:00.000
They feel that.
but it's a little different.

137
00:16:01.206 --> 00:16:04.241
[Ben] Betty notices that her
dress has been ripped.

138
00:16:04.275 --> 00:16:09.103
She only bought this dress
just before and this is the
first time she's ever worn it.

139
00:16:09.137 --> 00:16:10.551
She takes it off.

140
00:16:10.586 --> 00:16:13.344
She feels like she doesn't
want to be associated with it

141
00:16:13.379 --> 00:16:17.413
and she puts it in her closet.
and never wears it again.

142
00:16:17.448 --> 00:16:19.862
He's just trying to figure out
what happened to him.

143
00:16:21.068 --> 00:16:22.793
And Barney doesn't
really know.

144
00:16:22.827 --> 00:16:25.000
And it's got him
deeply disturbed.

145
00:16:35.137 --> 00:16:38.827
[Kathleen] Betty was very
curious. She wanted
to learn more.

146
00:16:38.862 --> 00:16:42.586
But Barney said. Betty.
don't tell anyone.

147
00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.275
No good can ever come of this.

148
00:16:45.793 --> 00:16:47.241
And she disagreed.

149
00:16:47.275 --> 00:16:51.310
She walked to the phone
and she called my mother.

150
00:16:54.551 --> 00:16:56.758
We had a neighbor
who was a physicist.

151
00:16:56.793 --> 00:17:00.068
Betty was concerned
about the contamination.

152
00:17:00.103 --> 00:17:03.034
And so. she asked my mother
to call our neighbor

153
00:17:03.068 --> 00:17:06.172
to find out what she
and Barney should do.

154
00:17:06.206 --> 00:17:09.034
He told. Betty.
if she had a compass

155
00:17:09.068 --> 00:17:11.448
that she should take it out
to the car

156
00:17:11.482 --> 00:17:13.793
to see how the needle reacts.

157
00:17:13.827 --> 00:17:15.965
That's not going to measure
radiation.

158
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.482
that's going to measure
a magnetic field.

159
00:17:18.517 --> 00:17:22.068
So apparently.
he knew something about UFOs

160
00:17:22.103 --> 00:17:24.310
that Betty and Barney
didn't know.

161
00:18:19.275 --> 00:18:21.517
Betty called my mother again.

162
00:18:21.551 --> 00:18:26.482
And the former Chief of Police
of Newton. New Hampshire

163
00:18:26.517 --> 00:18:29.517
was at the house
having a cup of coffee.

164
00:18:30.931 --> 00:18:33.137
He was my father's
best friend.

165
00:18:33.172 --> 00:18:36.275
And he said to tell Betty

166
00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:40.413
that she and Barney
need to make a report
to Pease Air Force Base.

167
00:18:43.068 --> 00:18:47.310
Because they had notified
all of the police departments

168
00:18:47.344 --> 00:18:50.379
that if anyone had a UFO
sighting. they should
report it.

169
00:18:51.965 --> 00:18:55.551
[Bryce] Peace Air Force Base
is the local air force base

170
00:18:55.586 --> 00:18:59.344
in Portsmouth. New Hampshire
in 1961.

171
00:18:59.379 --> 00:19:03.620
Betty and Barney know people
that are involved
in the military there.

172
00:19:03.655 --> 00:19:06.310
She gets hold of somebody
at Peace Air Force Base

173
00:19:06.344 --> 00:19:10.965
who takes their story in
isn't that interested in it.

174
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.137
Until they start talking
about the extension wings

175
00:19:14.172 --> 00:19:15.448
and red lights coming out.

176
00:19:15.482 --> 00:19:18.344
then he's very interested
in it.

177
00:19:18.379 --> 00:19:22.862
The next day. they actually
hear from a captain
Paul Henderson at Peace

178
00:19:22.896 --> 00:19:26.310
who wants to know
the whole story in detail.

179
00:19:26.344 --> 00:19:30.758
So suddenly. they've told this
story that is now being
taken very seriously.

180
00:19:55.344 --> 00:20:00.310
[narrator] Incredibly.
the Hills are told of another
sighting reported that night.

181
00:20:00.344 --> 00:20:05.827
The officer said that
the controller at the tower
had reported

182
00:20:05.862 --> 00:20:12.827
there was an unusual craft
seen on radar at 2:14 a.m.

183
00:20:12.862 --> 00:20:15.896
on the night that Betty and
Barney had their experience.

184
00:20:16.482 --> 00:20:20.448
[indistinct chatter]

185
00:20:20.482 --> 00:20:22.310
[narrator]
Could the two be related?

186
00:20:28.137 --> 00:20:31.517
[Kathleen] The following day.
my parents and my two brothers

187
00:20:31.551 --> 00:20:35.275
and I drove to Portsmouth
to Betty's and Barney's home.

188
00:20:37.103 --> 00:20:43.827
I was excited in anticipation
of hearing their story
for myself.

189
00:20:43.862 --> 00:20:46.965
And we finally arrived there.

190
00:20:48.034 --> 00:20:50.655
We went into the kitchen
with Betty.

191
00:20:50.689 --> 00:20:54.586
And she told us
about the close encounter.

192
00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.068
She told us about
the buzzing sounds.

193
00:20:58.689 --> 00:21:01.965
We wanted to see the spots
on the trunk of the car.

194
00:21:05.103 --> 00:21:09.344
So she took us down
the hallway
and out to the vehicle.

195
00:21:11.413 --> 00:21:15.482
I could see
those very shiny spots.

196
00:21:15.517 --> 00:21:17.034
And I took my finger.

197
00:21:17.068 --> 00:21:20.586
And I attempted to rub
a spot off.

198
00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:24.793
My mother saw me and said.
"Don't touch it.
don't touch that spot.

199
00:21:24.827 --> 00:21:26.344
It might harm you."

200
00:21:26.379 --> 00:21:30.551
And very quickly.
I was taken back into Betty's
and Barney's house.

201
00:21:32.931 --> 00:21:35.379
It was sort of an epiphany
in the sense

202
00:21:35.413 --> 00:21:40.931
that here is something
that I had no idea existed.

203
00:21:40.965 --> 00:21:46.275
But suddenly. I was clued
into the fact
that it was real.

204
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:50.413
[narrator]
That epiphany will lead
Kathleen on a lifelong mission

205
00:21:50.448 --> 00:21:54.206
to uncover what really
happened to her aunt
and uncle that night...

206
00:21:56.103 --> 00:21:57.103
outside...

207
00:21:58.482 --> 00:22:02.551
and then inside the UFO.

208
00:22:16.068 --> 00:22:18.758
[narrator] Several days
after her UFO encounter.

209
00:22:18.793 --> 00:22:21.034
Betty Hill visits
her local library

210
00:22:21.068 --> 00:22:24.965
where she checks out
The Flying Saucer Conspiracy

211
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.896
by retired Marine Corps
major Donald Keyhoe.

212
00:22:29.655 --> 00:22:32.551
Widely regarded
as a leading UFO expert.

213
00:22:32.586 --> 00:22:37.310
major Keyhoe is a proponent
of various theories
explaining UFOs.

214
00:22:37.344 --> 00:22:38.896
government cover-ups.

215
00:22:38.931 --> 00:22:41.931
and the threat
of interplanetary war.

216
00:22:44.862 --> 00:22:47.965
Major Keyhoe as an authority
on flying saucers.

217
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.586
do you yourself believe
that they exist?

218
00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:53.413
Well. I'm positive they exist.

219
00:22:53.448 --> 00:22:57.517
The weight of the evidence
makes it impossible to arrive
at any other conclusion.

220
00:22:57.551 --> 00:23:00.379
What tangible evidence
do you have?

221
00:23:00.413 --> 00:23:03.241
Well. at least 800 reports
from trained observers.

222
00:23:03.275 --> 00:23:06.275
veteran pilots. radar men.
guided missile trackers.

223
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:10.551
weather bureau observers.
all people who are trained
to know things in the sky.

224
00:23:10.586 --> 00:23:13.862
who describe these objects
maneuvering under
intelligent control.

225
00:23:13.896 --> 00:23:15.827
There are hundreds
of those reports

226
00:23:15.862 --> 00:23:18.896
where the sightings
were confirmed visually
and by radar.

227
00:23:18.931 --> 00:23:21.000
and in some cases
by photograph.

228
00:23:21.034 --> 00:23:22.413
[Ben]
There's kind of an evolution

229
00:23:22.448 --> 00:23:25.310
that takes place with UFOs
in the United States.

230
00:23:26.241 --> 00:23:28.551
In the 40s and into the 50s.

231
00:23:28.586 --> 00:23:31.206
the government was primarily
concerned with the panic.

232
00:23:33.103 --> 00:23:36.482
They wanted to be able
to control the reaction
of the public.

233
00:23:38.551 --> 00:23:43.620
There was an official
government policy
to ridicule and debunk

234
00:23:43.655 --> 00:23:45.724
and really make
the witnesses feel

235
00:23:45.758 --> 00:23:48.793
as if they are the fringe.
they are the crazy ones.

236
00:23:48.827 --> 00:23:52.862
And they don't deserve any
merit because people really
aren't seeing these things.

237
00:23:52.896 --> 00:23:55.655
So when the. the Hill incident
happens.

238
00:23:55.689 --> 00:23:59.965
it's among all of this frenzy
of UFO activity.

239
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.448
But yet. people don't know
how to feel about it.

240
00:24:05.586 --> 00:24:08.379
[narrator] Curious to know
more about her own experience.

241
00:24:08.413 --> 00:24:10.172
Betty writes to major Keyhoe.

242
00:24:15.655 --> 00:24:19.517
She has begun. what will
become a lifelong search
for the truth.

243
00:24:23.517 --> 00:24:26.793
What she finds
will shock the world.

244
00:24:33.172 --> 00:24:35.586
Located an hour
north of Boston.

245
00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:38.310
Portsmouth is New Hampshire's
oldest settlement

246
00:24:38.344 --> 00:24:39.862
and only seaport.

247
00:24:43.551 --> 00:24:45.793
In addition to its historic
importance.

248
00:24:47.482 --> 00:24:50.758
by the 1960s.
the city and surrounding area

249
00:24:50.793 --> 00:24:53.000
had become noted
for its fishing industry...

250
00:24:54.448 --> 00:24:56.655
strategic military
importance...

251
00:25:00.103 --> 00:25:03.000
and beautiful beaches.

252
00:25:03.034 --> 00:25:07.103
[Kathleen] Betty was a child
welfare worker for the state
of New Hampshire.

253
00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:11.482
She cared for other people.

254
00:25:11.517 --> 00:25:15.517
She cared for children
who were being abused

255
00:25:15.551 --> 00:25:19.586
by their parents or children
who were being neglected.

256
00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:22.344
And then she worked
in adoption.

257
00:25:22.379 --> 00:25:26.724
She was eventually promoted
to the position of supervisor.

258
00:25:26.758 --> 00:25:28.517
She had an opinion
on everything.

259
00:25:28.551 --> 00:25:30.206
She loved to express it.

260
00:25:30.241 --> 00:25:33.413
And if you took her on
and you battled her about it.
she was even happier.

261
00:25:33.448 --> 00:25:37.068
She wanted to be part
of the world.

262
00:25:41.965 --> 00:25:45.275
[Kathleen] Betty met Barney at
Hampton Beach. New Hampshire.

263
00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:48.931
which was very close
to her home in Portsmouth.

264
00:25:48.965 --> 00:25:53.413
And she was working
during the summers down there
sometimes.

265
00:25:55.551 --> 00:26:01.206
Betty had friends
in Portsmouth
and they knew Barney.

266
00:26:01.241 --> 00:26:04.275
So they met
and she said to Barney.

267
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:09.896
well. I have an apartment
that I rent to tourists.

268
00:26:09.931 --> 00:26:14.310
And if you and your family
ever come up here again.

269
00:26:14.344 --> 00:26:16.413
I'd be happy to rent it
to you.

270
00:26:16.448 --> 00:26:19.896
So it was sort of
a congenial relationship.

271
00:26:23.379 --> 00:26:28.206
Barney was highly intelligent.
His IQ was 140.

272
00:26:28.241 --> 00:26:31.931
He wanted to go to college
to become an engineer.

273
00:26:31.965 --> 00:26:35.275
But he was told
that that was not something

274
00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:38.068
that he would ever be
able to do

275
00:26:38.103 --> 00:26:40.758
because of the color
of his skin.

276
00:26:40.793 --> 00:26:45.724
He ended up joining the army
before the outbreak
of World War II.

277
00:26:45.758 --> 00:26:49.103
He was a marksman.
He was a truck driver.

278
00:26:49.137 --> 00:26:52.310
And he ended up being wounded.

279
00:26:52.344 --> 00:26:55.896
He then was able to get a job
at the Post Office.

280
00:26:55.931 --> 00:26:59.689
And he worked for the US
Post Office for many years.

281
00:26:59.724 --> 00:27:04.931
He married. He had two sons.
But he and his wife divorced.

282
00:27:04.965 --> 00:27:09.724
So this is when he began
a relationship with Betty.

283
00:27:17.068 --> 00:27:19.586
[narrator] Barney eventually
moves to Portsmouth.

284
00:27:21.275 --> 00:27:25.896
And after dating for a few
years. he and Betty marry.

285
00:27:25.931 --> 00:27:29.827
They were one of the few mixed
marriages in Portsmouth.

286
00:27:29.862 --> 00:27:31.931
Although Portsmouth this time.

287
00:27:31.965 --> 00:27:35.862
there was fairly large
African-American population.

288
00:27:35.896 --> 00:27:38.379
But you don't want
to think of Portsmouth

289
00:27:38.413 --> 00:27:40.448
or pretty much
any New England town

290
00:27:40.482 --> 00:27:44.413
as being a northern town
without racism.

291
00:27:44.448 --> 00:27:48.551
I mean. systemic racism
is the name of the game

292
00:27:48.586 --> 00:27:51.827
as much through New England
really as the south.

293
00:27:51.862 --> 00:27:54.793
Barney was one of the people
fighting this with Betty.

294
00:27:54.827 --> 00:27:57.034
He was an activist
in the NAACP.

295
00:27:57.068 --> 00:28:00.586
He was doing what he could
to bring this to light.

296
00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:02.862
Always leading to the idea

297
00:28:02.896 --> 00:28:07.034
that to come out
as an abductee of aliens

298
00:28:07.068 --> 00:28:09.620
was a huge risk on his part.

299
00:28:09.655 --> 00:28:12.241
And he was very concerned
about his personality

300
00:28:12.275 --> 00:28:14.655
and how he was seen
by other people.

301
00:28:14.689 --> 00:28:16.586
So this was a massive risk
to him.

302
00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:18.344
which I think leads
to the idea

303
00:28:18.379 --> 00:28:22.827
of how much he and Betty's
story is actually.
a love story.

304
00:28:25.379 --> 00:28:28.965
[narrator]
But little do they know
the UFO incident is not over

305
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.103
and will continue
to haunt them.

306
00:28:34.137 --> 00:28:37.241
Ten days after their encounter
in the White Mountains.

307
00:28:37.275 --> 00:28:42.103
Betty suffers a series
of vivid dreams
that last over five nights.

308
00:28:44.689 --> 00:28:48.931
[Kathleen] In her dreams.
there was an encounter

309
00:28:48.965 --> 00:28:51.517
with very human-like entities.

310
00:28:56.586 --> 00:28:58.517
They surrounded the car

311
00:28:58.551 --> 00:29:03.103
and then they took Betty
and Barney onto the craft

312
00:29:03.137 --> 00:29:07.206
where they did highly
unusual physical examination.

313
00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:16.655
[narrator] In this rare
interview from 1968.

314
00:29:16.689 --> 00:29:21.068
Betty describes what happened
on board the alien craft.

315
00:29:21.103 --> 00:29:25.379
First. they took Barney
into one room and I went
into a second room.

316
00:29:25.413 --> 00:29:31.137
In this room. they did what
I would call a fairly simple
physical examination.

317
00:29:31.172 --> 00:29:37.103
They seem to have mostly
interest in my skin.

318
00:29:37.137 --> 00:29:40.758
I had the idea they were
taking pictures of my skin.

319
00:29:40.793 --> 00:29:44.482
Also. interest in my hands
and my feet.

320
00:29:44.517 --> 00:29:48.344
They also did a test
which they call checking
my nervous system.

321
00:29:48.379 --> 00:29:49.655
Throughout
the whole examination.

322
00:29:49.689 --> 00:29:52.448
it would be like picking up
some kind of a strange animal

323
00:29:52.482 --> 00:29:56.344
and looking it over.
giving it a checkup
and putting it back down again

324
00:29:56.379 --> 00:29:58.655
without any intentions
of harming it.

325
00:30:00.551 --> 00:30:05.000
[narrator] The vivid nature
of the dreams along with
the strange buzzing sounds

326
00:30:05.034 --> 00:30:08.551
are too much for Betty
to simply dismiss.

327
00:30:08.586 --> 00:30:14.206
She was wondering
if. if this somehow
represented reality.

328
00:30:16.103 --> 00:30:20.517
Now. she was a social worker.
She had studied psychology.

329
00:30:20.551 --> 00:30:25.827
And dreams that you have
just before you wake up
in the morning

330
00:30:25.862 --> 00:30:29.517
when you're sort of
in a hypnotic state

331
00:30:29.551 --> 00:30:33.689
can include information
that really occurred.

332
00:30:33.724 --> 00:30:37.172
Yet. there can be
fantasy added.

333
00:30:37.206 --> 00:30:41.655
Betty initially jotted her
dreams down on note paper.

334
00:30:41.689 --> 00:30:45.379
And she couldn't forget
about them.

335
00:30:45.413 --> 00:30:49.379
And she spoke to her
supervisor who said to her.

336
00:30:49.413 --> 00:30:53.655
Maybe this represents
what really happened to you

337
00:30:53.689 --> 00:30:56.068
between those buzzing sounds.

338
00:30:56.103 --> 00:31:01.344
And maybe this is what
happened during that period
that you can't remember.

339
00:31:01.379 --> 00:31:05.000
So Betty sat down and
she typed those dreams out.

340
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:12.275
[narrator]
Betty knew she and Barney saw
something that night.

341
00:31:14.413 --> 00:31:16.137
But what?

342
00:31:16.172 --> 00:31:18.551
What about those
buzzing sounds?

343
00:31:18.586 --> 00:31:22.448
Why did the car have those
strange shiny spots?

344
00:31:23.482 --> 00:31:26.000
Could her nightmares be true?

345
00:31:41.275 --> 00:31:46.344
[narrator] Betty Hill's letter
to Major Donald Keyhoe
generates interest at NICAP.

346
00:31:46.379 --> 00:31:50.517
the National Investigations
Committee on Aerial Phenomena.

347
00:31:50.551 --> 00:31:52.206
According to their records.

348
00:31:52.241 --> 00:31:54.758
similar looking
unidentified craft

349
00:31:54.793 --> 00:32:00.344
had been reported flying
over California. Kentucky
and Indiana.

350
00:32:00.379 --> 00:32:05.689
NICAP in the '50s and '60s
is one of the only legitimate
and true organizations

351
00:32:05.724 --> 00:32:09.517
dedicated to the scientific
study of UFOs.

352
00:32:09.551 --> 00:32:11.862
Now. Project Blue Book
is the government's arm

353
00:32:11.896 --> 00:32:14.241
of the air force officially
investigating.

354
00:32:14.275 --> 00:32:16.310
But as a citizen group.

355
00:32:16.344 --> 00:32:19.586
only NICAP and a few others
were those who brought in

356
00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:22.862
scientists.
medical professionals

357
00:32:22.896 --> 00:32:26.965
and had a very rigid way
of investigating these events.

358
00:32:32.965 --> 00:32:38.655
[narrator]
In October. 1961. Boston-based
NICAP investigator Walter Webb

359
00:32:38.689 --> 00:32:42.241
interviews the Hills
at their home in Portsmouth.
New Hampshire.

360
00:32:42.275 --> 00:32:46.068
[Kathleen] Walter Webb was an
investigator for NICAP.

361
00:32:46.103 --> 00:32:50.068
He wanted to know.
in as much detail as possible.

362
00:32:50.103 --> 00:32:53.551
where the sighting
occurred initially.

363
00:32:55.275 --> 00:32:57.586
How the craft reacted.

364
00:32:58.724 --> 00:33:01.793
How this changed
as they observed it.

365
00:33:03.068 --> 00:33:06.827
What Barney saw
as he stood in that field.

366
00:33:13.034 --> 00:33:17.896
Walter Webb believed their
story because they didn't
enlarge on it.

367
00:33:17.931 --> 00:33:21.965
They were serious
in retelling what happened.

368
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.551
They were consistent
in their details.

369
00:33:25.586 --> 00:33:30.172
Because he interviewed them
separately before he
interviewed them together.

370
00:33:30.206 --> 00:33:32.965
And so. everything meshed.

371
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:39.137
He thought that they were
reliable. intelligent
individuals.

372
00:33:39.172 --> 00:33:43.586
with no reason to want to
make something like this up.

373
00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:48.689
The scientific community. at
least those who are interested
in the subject. took note

374
00:33:48.724 --> 00:33:51.172
that we have some very
credible witnesses here.

375
00:33:51.206 --> 00:33:54.000
They're in high standing
in society.

376
00:33:54.034 --> 00:33:55.379
They have a lot to lose.

377
00:33:55.413 --> 00:33:57.724
And so.
given the credibility of it.

378
00:33:57.758 --> 00:34:02.000
it's kind of one of the first
times that many of them
had taken note

379
00:34:02.034 --> 00:34:05.655
that we should listen
to the alleged abductees.

380
00:34:12.758 --> 00:34:14.068
[narrator] A few weeks later.

381
00:34:14.103 --> 00:34:17.000
when another set
of investigators
question the Hills.

382
00:34:17.034 --> 00:34:19.034
they make a startling
revelation.

383
00:34:44.758 --> 00:34:48.862
[narrator]
What happened during those
two hours of missing time?

384
00:34:49.448 --> 00:34:52.413
[Barney speaking]

385
00:35:01.827 --> 00:35:03.517
[Bryce] Imagine you're
Betty and Barney.

386
00:35:03.551 --> 00:35:05.965
you've seen this UFO.
you've seen these creatures

387
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.137
and then you begin to realize
that there's a couple hours
that are unaccounted for.

388
00:35:10.172 --> 00:35:12.034
They started to get an inkling

389
00:35:12.068 --> 00:35:17.000
that maybe there was more
to that two-hour period
than it first met the eye.

390
00:35:22.275 --> 00:35:27.068
[narrator]
Could Betty's dreams be
nightmares of something real?

391
00:35:27.103 --> 00:35:32.344
Is it possible they
were abducted by aliens
during the missing time?

392
00:35:32.379 --> 00:35:35.034
Betty and Barney decide
to investigate further.

393
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:40.793
Shortly after Betty and Barney
met with Homan & Jackson.

394
00:35:40.827 --> 00:35:45.310
they made trips
up to the White Mountains.

395
00:35:45.344 --> 00:35:51.758
They were attempting
to remember more to jog their
memories of what had occurred.

396
00:35:56.413 --> 00:36:01.172
In Betty's dreams. she
remembered a huge fiery orb

397
00:36:01.206 --> 00:36:05.310
that seemed to be sitting
on the ground of a roadblock.

398
00:36:05.344 --> 00:36:08.206
But she didn't know where
or when that occurred

399
00:36:08.241 --> 00:36:12.172
of a dirt road with tall trees
all around.

400
00:36:12.206 --> 00:36:14.275
And this was very perplexing.

401
00:36:20.827 --> 00:36:23.862
[Ben]
The whole experience from the
days. the months and the years

402
00:36:23.896 --> 00:36:28.413
after the event took a major
toll on their relationship.

403
00:36:30.551 --> 00:36:35.172
Betty wanted to understand
this and to unlock
the secrets.

404
00:36:35.206 --> 00:36:37.586
if you will. of everything
that happened.

405
00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:40.137
What were the events
that were haunting her?

406
00:36:41.517 --> 00:36:43.344
Barney wanted to keep quiet.

407
00:36:43.379 --> 00:36:45.379
He didn't want it to affect
their public life

408
00:36:45.413 --> 00:36:47.620
and his standing
in the civil rights movements

409
00:36:47.655 --> 00:36:51.068
and everything
that they were involved in.

410
00:36:51.103 --> 00:36:56.413
Barney was still attempting
to forget about it.
but he wouldn't.

411
00:36:56.448 --> 00:37:03.275
It was really eating away at
him and was deeply troubling.

412
00:37:04.448 --> 00:37:06.655
[narrator] Concerned over
a worsening ulcer.

413
00:37:06.689 --> 00:37:10.068
Barney visits a psychiatrist
hoping to find relief.

414
00:37:56.655 --> 00:37:59.655
[narrator] Barney prepares
to go under hypnosis.

415
00:37:59.689 --> 00:38:03.068
After years of blocking out
what happened.

416
00:38:03.103 --> 00:38:07.137
will Barney finally come
face-to-face with his demons?

417
00:38:24.034 --> 00:38:27.448
[narrator] Two years
after the UFO encounter.

418
00:38:27.482 --> 00:38:30.551
Betty and Barney Hill travel
to Boston

419
00:38:30.586 --> 00:38:33.655
for a visit with one of the
country's leading experts

420
00:38:33.689 --> 00:38:37.827
in regressive hypnosis.
Dr. Benjamin Simon.

421
00:38:39.862 --> 00:38:44.344
Dr. Simon had earned a
reputation for himself when he
was a colonel in the army.

422
00:38:45.655 --> 00:38:47.758
He developed
a special technique

423
00:38:47.793 --> 00:38:52.793
using deep trance hypnosis
in order to resolve the trauma

424
00:38:52.827 --> 00:38:57.344
that soldiers who were
returning from the war
had experienced.

425
00:38:57.379 --> 00:39:00.103
That caused physiological
ailments.

426
00:39:00.137 --> 00:39:01.965
When I snapped my finger.
you'll be able to let go

427
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.379
and then you'll get sleepy and
your eyes are getting heavier.

428
00:39:07.413 --> 00:39:10.793
[narrator]
Is it possible that Betty and
Barney were experiencing

429
00:39:10.827 --> 00:39:14.103
post-traumatic stress
after their UFO encounter?

430
00:39:17.586 --> 00:39:19.931
And could Dr. Simon help them?

431
00:39:23.137 --> 00:39:27.827
In a rare interview. Dr. Simon
discusses his treatment
of the Hills.

432
00:40:01.448 --> 00:40:02.827
[narrator]
Over the next six months.

433
00:40:02.862 --> 00:40:06.724
both Betty and Barney undergo
a series of treatments.

434
00:40:06.758 --> 00:40:11.413
During these sessions.
Dr. Simon induces them
into a deep trance.

435
00:40:11.448 --> 00:40:15.586
Now. clasp your hands in front
of you tight. tight. tight.
tight. tight. tighter.

436
00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:17.172
As they get tighter.
you're going to sleep.

437
00:40:17.206 --> 00:40:19.034
You're going to a deep.
deep sleep.

438
00:40:19.068 --> 00:40:20.344
Your eyes are getting heavy.

439
00:40:20.379 --> 00:40:22.482
They're closing.
They're closing tight.

440
00:40:22.517 --> 00:40:25.724
Now. your hands are relaxed.
We're going back.

441
00:40:25.758 --> 00:40:30.310
We're going back to September
19th. 1961. when you were
returning from your vacation.

442
00:40:30.344 --> 00:40:33.275
We're going back to September
19th. 1961.

443
00:40:58.655 --> 00:41:00.103
[narrator]
While under hypnosis.

444
00:41:00.137 --> 00:41:03.724
Barney recalls everything
in his conscious memory.

445
00:41:03.758 --> 00:41:06.275
including the drive
through the White Mountains

446
00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:09.310
and seeing the strange light
up in the sky.

447
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.344
But when he gets to the part
about standing out in a field
and seeing a UFO.

448
00:41:17.379 --> 00:41:20.862
a mental block forms.
a panic sets in.

449
00:41:59.758 --> 00:42:05.206
When Dr. Simon pushes Barney
to go beyond

450
00:42:05.241 --> 00:42:08.172
that mental block
that he had developed.

451
00:42:08.206 --> 00:42:11.413
Barney says. "Please. doctor.
don't make me go there.

452
00:42:11.448 --> 00:42:13.379
please don't let me
remember that."

453
00:42:13.413 --> 00:42:16.827
And Dr. Simon said.
"You will remember that.

454
00:42:16.862 --> 00:42:18.344
It won't hurt you now."

455
00:42:49.034 --> 00:42:50.724
[Dr. Simon] Calm down.

456
00:42:50.758 --> 00:42:56.482
Barney had a very explosive
what's called an abreaction.

457
00:42:56.517 --> 00:43:00.896
where he released a great deal
of emotion.

458
00:43:04.551 --> 00:43:08.034
[narrator] Dr. Simon guides
Barney past his mental block.

459
00:43:08.068 --> 00:43:13.793
where he recalls for the first
time a powerful force
controlling him.

460
00:43:58.482 --> 00:44:01.034
[Bryce] Listening to Barney
is very difficult.

461
00:44:01.068 --> 00:44:03.103
He's hysterical.
He's screaming.

462
00:44:03.137 --> 00:44:07.724
He is reliving the most
terrifying moments
of his entire life.

463
00:44:07.758 --> 00:44:09.758
This is a man
that was in World War II.

464
00:44:13.137 --> 00:44:15.965
[narrator] Later. during
another hypnosis session.

465
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:22.275
Barney recalls hearing
the mysterious beeps
and what happens next.

466
00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:27.206
Suddenly. he's driving.
and he's driving.
and he's driving.

467
00:44:27.241 --> 00:44:29.896
And he makes a turn.

468
00:44:29.931 --> 00:44:36.379
And he says. "I don't know
why I had to make that turn."

469
00:44:36.413 --> 00:44:41.241
And then he finds himself
on a dirt road with tall trees
all around.

470
00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:54.758
There's a fiery orb
that he sees.

471
00:44:54.793 --> 00:45:01.241
And he sees these entities
standing in the road dressed
in shiny black uniforms.

472
00:45:01.275 --> 00:45:03.793
And then Barney says.
it's them.

473
00:45:07.931 --> 00:45:11.931
It's the ones I saw when
I was standing in the field

474
00:45:11.965 --> 00:45:14.586
looking through binoculars.

475
00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:19.689
[narrator] As the entities
close in on the car.
this time. there is no escape.

476
00:45:28.413 --> 00:45:34.068
[narrator] In early 1964.
two years
after her UFO encounter.

477
00:45:34.103 --> 00:45:39.034
Betty Hill also undergoes
hypnosis designed to recall
what happened that night.

478
00:45:45.862 --> 00:45:52.724
Under hypnosis. Betty
remembers everything that
she had conscious recall for.

479
00:45:52.758 --> 00:45:58.862
And then she remembers
Barney taking a sharp turn
in the road

480
00:45:58.896 --> 00:46:03.034
and they were then
on a dirt road with tall trees
all around.

481
00:46:32.793 --> 00:46:35.275
There were figures standing
in the road.

482
00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:38.413
And she observed
this huge fiery orb.

483
00:46:40.551 --> 00:46:44.586
And she's talking to Barney.
what is this?

484
00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:47.413
Are we being robbed?
Is there an accident ahead?

485
00:46:47.448 --> 00:46:50.241
Barney says to Betty.
"It's them."

486
00:46:54.068 --> 00:46:56.206
Betty becomes terrified.

487
00:46:56.241 --> 00:47:00.931
She has never been so
terrified in her entire life.

488
00:47:00.965 --> 00:47:02.758
She puts her hand on the door.

489
00:47:02.793 --> 00:47:05.517
She's going to run
into the woods to hide.

490
00:47:05.551 --> 00:47:09.482
but she's intercepted
and she loses consciousness.

491
00:47:12.413 --> 00:47:14.137
[narrator]
The next thing Betty remembers

492
00:47:14.172 --> 00:47:17.551
is the alien beings escorting
her through the woods

493
00:47:17.586 --> 00:47:19.689
and onto the spacecraft.

494
00:47:41.724 --> 00:47:46.413
[Kathleen] They're saying to
Betty. there's nothing to be
afraid of.

495
00:47:46.448 --> 00:47:49.034
we only need to do
a few simple tests.

496
00:47:49.068 --> 00:47:53.724
you won't be harmed
and then you'll very quickly
be on your way.

497
00:47:53.758 --> 00:47:55.103
She doesn't trust them.

498
00:47:57.275 --> 00:48:01.517
She kicks the one
who is beside her...

499
00:48:03.103 --> 00:48:05.586
and this tears the hem
on her dress down...

500
00:48:07.517 --> 00:48:11.724
and tears the lining of the
dress from waist to hemline.

501
00:48:11.758 --> 00:48:14.034
They've regained control
of her.

502
00:48:14.068 --> 00:48:18.137
And she is taken into an
examining room on the craft.

503
00:48:32.482 --> 00:48:36.275
[narrator] That's where Betty
meets someone she calls
the Examiner.

504
00:49:07.137 --> 00:49:13.827
They use some kind of stylus
pressing on the vertebrae
in her spine.

505
00:49:16.758 --> 00:49:18.931
They take skin samples.

506
00:50:07.827 --> 00:50:12.724
[sobbing]

507
00:51:26.862 --> 00:51:29.379
[narrator]
And then it was Barney's turn.

508
00:51:43.344 --> 00:51:46.551
[narrator] While under
hypnosis. Barney Hill recalls

509
00:51:46.586 --> 00:51:49.034
how after being abducted
by entities.

510
00:51:49.068 --> 00:51:51.896
he too was subjected
to a physical examination.

511
00:51:53.586 --> 00:51:57.413
Barney is placed on a table
and his clothes removed.

512
00:52:00.206 --> 00:52:05.206
They are interested in his
muscular structure as well.

513
00:52:05.241 --> 00:52:08.310
In his nervous system.
he's rolled over.

514
00:52:08.344 --> 00:52:14.310
He can feel what seems to be
something pushing along
the vertebrae in his spine.

515
00:52:51.172 --> 00:52:56.275
[Kathleen] Something slid
very easily
into Barney's rectum

516
00:52:56.310 --> 00:52:58.344
and then was removed
very rapidly.

517
00:52:58.379 --> 00:52:59.896
It wasn't painful.

518
00:52:59.931 --> 00:53:05.034
Then kind of a cup-like
device was placed
over his genitals.

519
00:53:05.068 --> 00:53:08.655
There was apparently
a sperm sample taken.

520
00:53:11.034 --> 00:53:12.655
[narrator]
And then it was over.

521
00:53:18.103 --> 00:53:20.482
After completing
their examinations.

522
00:53:20.517 --> 00:53:24.724
the entities escort
the Hills off the ship
and back to their car.

523
00:55:33.862 --> 00:55:38.344
[narrator] It is the most
extraordinary story
Dr. Simon has ever heard.

524
00:55:38.379 --> 00:55:40.862
[Betty] I've never been
so afraid in my life.

525
00:55:40.896 --> 00:55:43.241
[narrator]
Were these made-up memories?

526
00:55:43.275 --> 00:55:47.379
Or did Barney and Betty
really get abducted by aliens?

527
00:56:19.344 --> 00:56:22.241
[Bryce] Dr. Simon felt
that the best explanation

528
00:56:22.275 --> 00:56:24.344
might very well be
that the two of them

529
00:56:24.379 --> 00:56:27.000
had had some kind of
transference between them

530
00:56:27.034 --> 00:56:30.724
allowing them to sort of
create and build the story

531
00:56:30.758 --> 00:56:34.551
that Betty might have
had a stronger feeling
about this

532
00:56:34.586 --> 00:56:39.620
and her memories or dreams
contaminated Barney's memories
or dreams.

533
00:56:39.655 --> 00:56:41.655
But he wasn't accusing
them of hoaxing.

534
00:56:41.689 --> 00:56:45.034
He just felt that it was
a psychological condition.

535
00:56:47.344 --> 00:56:51.034
[narrator] While grateful
for the chance to tell their
stories through hypnosis.

536
00:56:51.068 --> 00:56:56.620
Betty and Barney disagree
with Dr. Simon's conclusions.

537
00:56:56.655 --> 00:57:00.793
They believe their independent
accounts or further
confirmation

538
00:57:00.827 --> 00:57:03.862
that what they experienced
was real.

539
00:57:06.344 --> 00:57:09.724
[Kathleen]
They couldn't go along
with Dr. Simon's suggestions

540
00:57:09.758 --> 00:57:15.000
that this had to be Barney's
absorbing Betty's dreams.

541
00:57:15.034 --> 00:57:19.758
And so. Barney just accepted
it as real.

542
00:57:19.793 --> 00:57:24.931
And he felt a lot better
because he had military
officers

543
00:57:24.965 --> 00:57:28.482
who were encouraging him.
who were telling him

544
00:57:28.517 --> 00:57:31.379
that. yes. all of these things
are true

545
00:57:31.413 --> 00:57:35.413
that we know there are
extraterrestrial craft coming
to visit our planet.

546
00:57:35.448 --> 00:57:37.172
And there's no reason
to believe

547
00:57:37.206 --> 00:57:39.448
that they're not
visiting humans.

548
00:57:39.482 --> 00:57:42.655
And so.
Barney felt much better.

549
00:57:45.413 --> 00:57:49.448
[narrator] While the Hills
are comforted that the truth
has come to light.

550
00:57:49.482 --> 00:57:51.448
they're determined
to keep it private.

551
00:57:54.689 --> 00:57:56.379
Little do they know.

552
00:57:56.413 --> 00:58:02.000
it's impossible to keep the
first and greatest abduction
story ever told.

553
00:58:02.034 --> 00:58:04.724
secret for long.

554
00:58:20.068 --> 00:58:25.862
By the fall of 1965.
four years have passed since
the Hill's UFO encounter.

555
00:58:26.965 --> 00:58:29.689
Their hypnosis sessions
too were in the past.

556
00:58:30.931 --> 00:58:32.758
Barney was now feeling better.

557
00:58:32.793 --> 00:58:36.793
And so. he and Betty had moved
on with their lives.

558
00:58:36.827 --> 00:58:41.551
[Kathleen] Barney was still
so involved
in the civil rights movement

559
00:58:41.586 --> 00:58:44.482
and his speaking engagements.

560
00:58:44.517 --> 00:58:49.655
Because that was what
he was really truly fighting
for. was civil rights.

561
00:58:51.965 --> 00:58:53.827
[narrator]
But then. in October...

562
00:58:55.137 --> 00:58:58.206
their lives turn upside down
once again

563
00:58:58.241 --> 00:59:02.068
when theBoston Traveler
prints a five-part series

564
00:59:02.103 --> 00:59:06.448
detailing the Hill's UFO
sighting and hypnosis
sessions.

565
00:59:08.793 --> 00:59:10.655
[Kathleen] It was
a huge story.

566
00:59:10.689 --> 00:59:13.655
It ran for five days
in the newspaper.

567
00:59:13.689 --> 00:59:17.137
Betty and Barney were
extremely distressed.

568
00:59:17.172 --> 00:59:19.827
The Boston Traveler
newspaper series.

569
00:59:19.862 --> 00:59:22.827
it blew the cover off
the story

570
00:59:22.862 --> 00:59:25.103
that they've been telling
a small group of people

571
00:59:25.137 --> 00:59:26.379
to a large group of people.

572
00:59:29.724 --> 00:59:31.344
When I first heard
about the story.

573
00:59:31.379 --> 00:59:36.758
I couldn't imagine that
somebody would either come up
with that or lie about it

574
00:59:36.793 --> 00:59:38.758
for several years.

575
00:59:38.793 --> 00:59:42.965
and meet with Air Force
officials and just make up
a story.

576
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:44.931
I mean. why would somebody
do that?

577
00:59:44.965 --> 00:59:50.034
And especially. two Portsmouth
people who were very
respectable and respected.

578
00:59:51.689 --> 00:59:56.448
There was a violation
of confidentiality in 1965.

579
00:59:58.034 --> 01:00:02.862
John Luttrell who was
a reporter for theBoston
Traveler in Boston

580
01:00:02.896 --> 01:00:08.758
had received
confidential information
from a friend of Betty's.

581
01:00:08.793 --> 01:00:11.896
And this woman had told him
everything that she knew

582
01:00:11.931 --> 01:00:14.862
about the encounter
and the hypnosis.

583
01:00:14.896 --> 01:00:18.482
He contacted Betty and Barney
and wanted to interview them.

584
01:00:18.517 --> 01:00:23.206
Betty and Barney said. no. we
do not want this story told.

585
01:00:30.482 --> 01:00:32.068
[narrator]
In this rare interview.

586
01:00:32.103 --> 01:00:35.241
award-winning investigative
reporter John Luttrell

587
01:00:35.275 --> 01:00:38.000
explains why he went ahead
with the story.

588
01:00:39.482 --> 01:00:42.862
These people deserved every
single consideration.

589
01:00:42.896 --> 01:00:46.137
But then. where do you draw
the line

590
01:00:46.172 --> 01:00:49.517
between maintaining a certain
degree of personal privacy

591
01:00:49.551 --> 01:00:52.344
or the public's right to know?

592
01:00:52.379 --> 01:00:54.586
And in making this decision.

593
01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:58.655
it had to be made abundantly
clear to all of the readers
that number one.

594
01:00:58.689 --> 01:01:02.655
the Hills themselves
did not initiate this
with theBoston Traveler.

595
01:01:02.689 --> 01:01:07.000
They have not chosen to talk
about any of the incidents
at all.

596
01:01:10.551 --> 01:01:13.137
[narrator] The sensational
tale of an alien abduction

597
01:01:13.172 --> 01:01:16.206
thrusts Betty and Barney
into the public spotlight.

598
01:01:18.172 --> 01:01:23.275
This had an impact
not only on Betty and Barney.
but on the entire family.

599
01:01:23.310 --> 01:01:29.241
We were a very respectable
family who had many
accomplishments.

600
01:01:29.275 --> 01:01:34.241
And we sat down and we talked
about how should we handle
this?

601
01:01:34.275 --> 01:01:37.034
Where will we go from here?

602
01:01:37.068 --> 01:01:42.793
And we decided as a family
that since it did
in fact happen

603
01:01:42.827 --> 01:01:49.103
and since the story had
been told that Betty and
Barney should tell the truth.

604
01:01:50.965 --> 01:01:54.000
[narrator] Unable to avoid
the intense media spotlight.

605
01:01:54.034 --> 01:01:57.862
the Hills cooperate
with author John Fuller
in the writing

606
01:01:57.896 --> 01:02:04.206
ofThe Interrupted Journey:
Two Lost Hours
Aboard a Flying Saucer.

607
01:02:04.241 --> 01:02:07.482
[Kathleen] The Interrupted
Journey
went worldwide.

608
01:02:07.517 --> 01:02:10.103
It was aNew York Times
bestseller.

609
01:02:10.137 --> 01:02:13.000
There was a tremendous
amount of public interest.

610
01:02:14.655 --> 01:02:18.206
[Bryce]
They literally shook the world
when their story came out.

611
01:02:26.965 --> 01:02:28.931
In today's terms.
The Interrupted Journey

612
01:02:28.965 --> 01:02:32.448
was like the final movie
in the AvengersSaga.

613
01:02:32.482 --> 01:02:33.793
I mean. it was huge.

614
01:02:33.827 --> 01:02:35.965
I mean. everybody
knew about it.

615
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.896
It was a book club selection.

616
01:02:37.931 --> 01:02:40.620
It was excerpted in newspapers
around the country.

617
01:02:40.655 --> 01:02:41.827
People couldn't get enough
of it.

618
01:02:41.862 --> 01:02:46.275
[screaming]

619
01:02:47.275 --> 01:02:51.310
Betty's story. which is
so dramatically told

620
01:02:51.344 --> 01:02:54.413
in which she's talking
to the aliens.

621
01:02:54.448 --> 01:02:56.620
There's all these things
that are going on.

622
01:02:56.655 --> 01:02:58.034
This story wrote itself.

623
01:02:59.689 --> 01:03:02.172
[Bryce] What makes
the Betty and
Barney case so extraordinary

624
01:03:02.206 --> 01:03:04.344
is it's just a case
about first.

625
01:03:04.379 --> 01:03:07.000
They were the first Americans
to claim to be abducted.

626
01:03:07.034 --> 01:03:10.862
It's the first time
that anyone had missing time.

627
01:03:11.551 --> 01:03:13.310
[indistinct]

628
01:03:13.344 --> 01:03:17.758
It's the first time that
hypnosis was used
to regress people

629
01:03:17.793 --> 01:03:19.172
to recover those memories.

630
01:03:19.206 --> 01:03:23.448
And it's also the first time
that anyone had described
the aliens

631
01:03:23.482 --> 01:03:27.000
as what is now popularly
known as the greys.

632
01:03:27.034 --> 01:03:31.068
So Betty and Barney
really just laid the template
out there.

633
01:03:36.103 --> 01:03:38.517
[narrator] The story explodes
into popular culture

634
01:03:38.551 --> 01:03:41.896
when book excerpts are
reprinted inLook Magazine.

635
01:03:43.034 --> 01:03:46.655
You got to remember that
if this is not like today.

636
01:03:46.689 --> 01:03:49.275
it's not like we each have
our own radio station

637
01:03:49.310 --> 01:03:52.655
and our own podcast and our
own TV channel that we watch
exclusively.

638
01:03:53.482 --> 01:03:55.482
There was minimum amount
of media.

639
01:03:55.517 --> 01:03:57.241
And so. they end up
inLook Magazine.

640
01:03:57.275 --> 01:03:58.379
That's huge.

641
01:04:03.275 --> 01:04:06.655
The book release changed
Betty's and Barney's lives.

642
01:04:06.689 --> 01:04:12.379
because Barney had been
appointed to the US Civil
Rights Commission.

643
01:04:12.413 --> 01:04:18.758
He also was very actively
involved in politics.
as was Betty.

644
01:04:18.793 --> 01:04:23.172
And they had to put
those activities aside
for the time being.

645
01:04:23.206 --> 01:04:29.689
And to publicize this book.
they took time off from work.

646
01:04:29.724 --> 01:04:32.655
So that they could travel
to do television shows.

647
01:04:32.689 --> 01:04:36.413
-What is your name. please?
-My name is Barney Hill.

648
01:04:36.448 --> 01:04:40.379
And they did many.
many radio shows as well.

649
01:04:41.517 --> 01:04:43.206
My name is Barney Hill.

650
01:04:45.241 --> 01:04:48.517
This was kind of exciting
to our family.

651
01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:51.068
Because at that point.

652
01:04:51.103 --> 01:04:56.068
we believed that finally
this was being acknowledged
as real.

653
01:04:56.103 --> 01:04:59.965
Which one of these
three gentlemen in truth
is Barney Hill?

654
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.827
Will the real Barney Hill
please stand up?

655
01:05:07.172 --> 01:05:10.344
[applauding]

656
01:05:15.655 --> 01:05:18.000
[narrator] The publicity
surrounding the abduction

657
01:05:18.034 --> 01:05:19.758
brings out a number
of skeptics

658
01:05:19.793 --> 01:05:25.793
who refuse to believe the
Hills. leaving many to wonder.
what really happened?

659
01:05:28.689 --> 01:05:33.931
It's a question Kathleen
has been trying to answer
since she was a teenager.

660
01:05:53.448 --> 01:05:57.931
For the past 40 years. Betty
and Barney's niece Kathleen

661
01:05:57.965 --> 01:06:01.517
has been investigating
the truth behind
the Hill abduction.

662
01:06:03.241 --> 01:06:05.758
[Kathleen] I decided
to investigate
this story

663
01:06:05.793 --> 01:06:11.551
because I was hearing
about it on television.

664
01:06:11.586 --> 01:06:17.034
I was reading about it
in magazine articles
and newspaper articles.

665
01:06:17.068 --> 01:06:22.034
But what I was reading was not
consistent with my memories
of what actually occurred.

666
01:06:24.379 --> 01:06:29.000
[narrator] In the process.
she has uncovered classified
documents kept secret

667
01:06:29.034 --> 01:06:32.206
and a government conspiracy
to hide the truth.

668
01:06:32.241 --> 01:06:37.034
I wanted to look at the
Project Blue Book documents

669
01:06:37.068 --> 01:06:41.137
that had been recorded
at Pease Air Force Base.

670
01:06:41.172 --> 01:06:44.379
but also the documents
that went to headquarters.

671
01:06:44.413 --> 01:06:49.034
I wanted to find any evidence
of further investigation

672
01:06:49.068 --> 01:06:52.344
that was done by the Air Force
and further documentation.

673
01:06:54.896 --> 01:07:00.931
I found that a false letter
was written in 1963

674
01:07:00.965 --> 01:07:05.862
that contradicted
the results of Betty's
and Barney's statements

675
01:07:05.896 --> 01:07:08.034
in the Project Blue Book
report.

676
01:07:09.896 --> 01:07:13.827
Betty and Barney talked about
the movement of the craft.

677
01:07:13.862 --> 01:07:20.379
how it moved erratically
in a zigzag fashion.
how it swooped down.

678
01:07:20.413 --> 01:07:25.965
So I wanted to compare that
to what was written in 1963.

679
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:32.551
In '63. it said that it was a
star-like object at all times

680
01:07:32.586 --> 01:07:35.724
and that there
was no movement.

681
01:07:36.517 --> 01:07:39.275
And so. that was just a lie.

682
01:07:39.310 --> 01:07:43.551
Over the years. there's
certainly been a lot of debate
back and forth

683
01:07:43.586 --> 01:07:46.068
about why doesn't
the government just tell us
what it knows.

684
01:07:46.103 --> 01:07:47.896
And the government has said.

685
01:07:47.931 --> 01:07:51.724
"Well. there's really nothing
to see here"
and tried to minimize it.

686
01:07:51.758 --> 01:07:54.000
And it's even worse
on the abduction phenomenon.

687
01:07:54.034 --> 01:07:58.965
which nobody seems to.
to want to talk about
on an official capacity.

688
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.896
And it's really not a surprise
because why would they.

689
01:08:01.931 --> 01:08:05.000
if what happened to Betty
and Barney has been repeated

690
01:08:05.034 --> 01:08:10.931
hundreds. thousands or tens of
thousands of times since 1961.

691
01:08:10.965 --> 01:08:15.068
What that says is we have
a really out of control
situation going on.

692
01:08:21.896 --> 01:08:25.689
One of the greatest pieces
of evidence that the Betty
and Barney Hill case

693
01:08:25.724 --> 01:08:31.551
could so desperately use would
be a bunch of witnesses
saying. I saw that thing too.

694
01:08:31.586 --> 01:08:34.137
And that is what
the original reporter

695
01:08:34.172 --> 01:08:37.137
for the Boston Traveler.
John Luttrell thought he had.

696
01:08:39.310 --> 01:08:44.241
[narrator] In 1976. John
Luttrell admitted to
interviewing these witnesses

697
01:08:44.275 --> 01:08:47.448
in a letter to nuclear
physicist
and UFO investigator.

698
01:08:47.482 --> 01:08:49.862
Stanton Friedman.

699
01:08:49.896 --> 01:08:55.586
Before Stanton Friedman passed
away. he gave me a letter
written by John Luttrell.

700
01:09:00.689 --> 01:09:07.793
And John Luttrell spoke
of 12 to 14 people
in the White Mountains

701
01:09:07.827 --> 01:09:11.551
who had observed a craft
by the same description

702
01:09:11.586 --> 01:09:14.689
on the same night
in the same time frame

703
01:09:14.724 --> 01:09:17.068
that Betty and Barney
saw this.

704
01:09:20.206 --> 01:09:22.896
His editors didn't feel that
that needed to be included

705
01:09:22.931 --> 01:09:26.517
in the five articles
that he wrote in 1965.

706
01:09:26.551 --> 01:09:29.655
Well. when Luttrell left
the Boston Traveler.

707
01:09:29.689 --> 01:09:34.827
he actually gave the file
to his editor with
all those witnesses in it.

708
01:09:34.862 --> 01:09:36.103
And guess what?

709
01:09:36.137 --> 01:09:38.482
That file has disappeared.

710
01:09:47.137 --> 01:09:49.241
[narrator] Perhaps the most
compelling clue

711
01:09:49.275 --> 01:09:53.172
is the dress Betty wore
the night of her abduction.

712
01:09:53.206 --> 01:09:55.620
[Kathleen] She had placed it
in her closet.

713
01:09:55.655 --> 01:10:00.862
And the next time she took it
out. she thought about
throwing the dress away.

714
01:10:00.896 --> 01:10:03.931
But on second thought.
she thought she would keep it

715
01:10:03.965 --> 01:10:07.206
because it might hold a clue
to what happened that night.

716
01:10:11.034 --> 01:10:14.482
[Ben] Over the years.
several tests
have been done on this dress.

717
01:10:14.517 --> 01:10:18.034
where there are areas where
it appears there are stains.

718
01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:27.724
Now. some of these results
indicate that there's an
organic material of some sort.

719
01:10:27.758 --> 01:10:31.586
But it wasn't until recently
when I re-examined the dress

720
01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:33.965
that I found something
very. very peculiar.

721
01:10:35.724 --> 01:10:39.620
Now. we knew about several
stains from the outside.

722
01:10:39.655 --> 01:10:42.413
But as I turn the dress
inside out.

723
01:10:42.448 --> 01:10:46.965
there's an inner lining to it.
where I found a series
of three spots.

724
01:10:49.068 --> 01:10:50.344
What's that from?

725
01:10:51.379 --> 01:10:53.896
The location of the stains
is important

726
01:10:53.931 --> 01:10:55.551
because some might say

727
01:10:55.586 --> 01:11:00.206
that it's. you know. residue
from female menstruation.
for example.

728
01:11:00.241 --> 01:11:03.275
But this area was higher up.

729
01:11:03.310 --> 01:11:07.827
It's higher in the abdomen
and pretty much
where I would expect

730
01:11:07.862 --> 01:11:11.517
if the story is true
that a needle was inserted.

731
01:11:11.551 --> 01:11:14.758
You've got different bodily
fluids that would have
leaked out.

732
01:11:14.793 --> 01:11:20.689
But from the inside.
staining the lining
of the dress on the inside

733
01:11:20.724 --> 01:11:23.137
and not going through
to the outside.

734
01:11:28.448 --> 01:11:32.344
We've confirmed that this
fluid does belong to Betty.

735
01:11:32.379 --> 01:11:35.551
and that she put this dress
away and never wore it again.

736
01:11:35.586 --> 01:11:41.137
To me. this is consistent with
the procedure of having put
the clothing back on

737
01:11:41.172 --> 01:11:46.310
or wearing it through
the procedure and indicating
it happened as she said.

738
01:11:49.793 --> 01:11:52.344
[Bryce] It seems pretty clear
what the aliens were doing

739
01:11:52.379 --> 01:11:57.586
based on the regression
tapes and the testimony
of Betty and Barney.

740
01:11:57.620 --> 01:12:00.310
They're taking a sperm sample
from Barney.

741
01:12:00.344 --> 01:12:03.551
They're testing Betty
to see if she's pregnant.

742
01:12:03.586 --> 01:12:08.034
Obviously. there's
a reproductive issue
that's being looked into.

743
01:12:08.068 --> 01:12:10.689
But they're also scraping
skin samples.

744
01:12:10.724 --> 01:12:12.965
It's clearly a medical exam.

745
01:12:23.206 --> 01:12:26.551
It seems like they want to
know more about our biology.

746
01:12:26.586 --> 01:12:29.241
Why else would they be
conducting medical
experiments?

747
01:12:35.206 --> 01:12:37.689
It seems like they don't
have all the answers.

748
01:12:37.724 --> 01:12:39.344
So. do they keep coming back?

749
01:12:39.379 --> 01:12:41.000
Have they gotten
what they want?

750
01:12:41.034 --> 01:12:42.586
Do they know everything
they need to know?

751
01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:44.310
Or is there a further motive?

752
01:12:48.551 --> 01:12:50.275
[narrator] In the 1970s.

753
01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:55.379
the controversy surrounding
the Hill abduction explodes
in the media once more.

754
01:12:55.413 --> 01:13:00.344
This time.
when a schoolteacher in Ohio
claims the Hill story is real

755
01:13:00.379 --> 01:13:04.137
and she knows
where the aliens came from.

756
01:13:14.448 --> 01:13:17.862
[narrator] One unanswered
question has always been.

757
01:13:17.896 --> 01:13:20.344
where did these entities
come from?

758
01:13:21.482 --> 01:13:24.068
[Bryce] During her dreams
and during hypnosis.

759
01:13:24.103 --> 01:13:27.275
Betty Hill described
seeing a star map

760
01:13:27.310 --> 01:13:30.413
that one of the alien
creatures had showed her
a map.

761
01:13:30.448 --> 01:13:34.517
a destination map of the
routes that had been traveled.

762
01:13:35.965 --> 01:13:39.896
She said to the Leader.
"I know you're not from
around here.

763
01:13:39.931 --> 01:13:42.241
Where's your home port?"

764
01:13:42.275 --> 01:13:47.724
And he produced this
three-dimensional star map.

765
01:15:01.206 --> 01:15:03.862
[narrator] Under instructions
from Dr. Simon.

766
01:15:03.896 --> 01:15:06.551
Betty later reproduced the map
from memory.

767
01:15:08.137 --> 01:15:15.103
Then in 1974. the school
teacher in Ohio claims to have
deciphered the map

768
01:15:15.137 --> 01:15:19.379
and located the star system
where the entities originated.

769
01:15:19.413 --> 01:15:23.482
Marjorie Fish was a brilliant
woman from Ohio.

770
01:15:23.517 --> 01:15:27.517
She had studied biology
in college.

771
01:15:27.551 --> 01:15:31.344
And she was an amateur
astronomer. a member of Mensa.

772
01:15:31.379 --> 01:15:33.586
Meaning that she had
a very high IQ.

773
01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:37.103
She saw Betty's star map
in the first book

774
01:15:37.137 --> 01:15:40.896
that was written
about the abduction.

775
01:15:40.931 --> 01:15:45.172
And she was interested in it.
She was skeptical.

776
01:15:45.206 --> 01:15:50.448
But she thought that
if this place really did exist
in our galaxy.

777
01:15:50.482 --> 01:15:52.206
that she'd be able to find it.

778
01:15:55.862 --> 01:16:00.655
[narrator] In order
to understand the perspective
from which the map was drawn.

779
01:16:00.689 --> 01:16:06.655
Fish constructed an elaborate
3D model using fishing line
and colored beads.

780
01:16:08.793 --> 01:16:12.862
[Marjorie] I set up
a number of criteria
when I started the search.

781
01:16:12.896 --> 01:16:15.551
One was that the sun
had to be in the pattern

782
01:16:15.586 --> 01:16:18.000
and it had be one of the stars
with a line to it.

783
01:16:18.034 --> 01:16:21.931
Because the one Betty called
the Leader had said.

784
01:16:21.965 --> 01:16:27.034
"Where are you in the map
and indicating that the sun
was in the map?"

785
01:16:27.068 --> 01:16:29.206
[Kathleen] And this
was difficult in those days.

786
01:16:29.241 --> 01:16:30.724
She didn't have a computer.

787
01:16:30.758 --> 01:16:34.620
She had to hand copy
all of the distance data

788
01:16:34.655 --> 01:16:39.517
that was available
on the stars in our local
galactic neighborhood.

789
01:16:39.551 --> 01:16:42.344
And the properties
of those stars

790
01:16:42.379 --> 01:16:46.862
out 54 light years from
our sun in every direction.

791
01:16:49.379 --> 01:16:52.965
In all.
she constructed 14 models.

792
01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.655
She still didn't have a match.

793
01:16:55.689 --> 01:17:00.241
But there was a new catalog
that was released.

794
01:17:00.275 --> 01:17:02.862
She took the new distance
data back.

795
01:17:02.896 --> 01:17:06.482
She constructed a model.
She found a match.

796
01:17:08.862 --> 01:17:14.000
[Marjorie] I had all 12 points
plus three background stars.

797
01:17:14.034 --> 01:17:17.758
And at this point. I was very
elated and very happy.

798
01:17:17.793 --> 01:17:19.172
I didn't sleep at all
that night.

799
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.034
[narrator]
According to her evidence.

800
01:17:24.068 --> 01:17:29.172
the beings that abducted the
Hills came from Zeta Reticuli.

801
01:17:29.206 --> 01:17:33.689
a binary star system located
39 light years from Earth.

802
01:17:36.241 --> 01:17:39.862
What we know about these stars
is that they're very similar
to our sun.

803
01:17:39.896 --> 01:17:41.896
They're called main
sequence stars.

804
01:17:41.931 --> 01:17:45.206
And so. they're the right age.
the right temperature.

805
01:17:45.241 --> 01:17:48.793
If there are planets revolving
around them.

806
01:17:48.827 --> 01:17:53.862
they could be at the perfect
what we call goldilocks.
you know. distance.

807
01:17:53.896 --> 01:17:55.482
where they could support life.

808
01:17:57.931 --> 01:18:01.482
[Kathleen]
We may never know for certain

809
01:18:01.517 --> 01:18:07.689
if there is indeed life on
planets around Zeta Reticuli
one and two.

810
01:18:07.724 --> 01:18:13.034
But there is a good
possibility that there is.

811
01:18:13.068 --> 01:18:19.620
We have discovered that
that area of space

812
01:18:19.655 --> 01:18:23.689
that these extraterrestrials
allegedly came from

813
01:18:23.724 --> 01:18:26.965
is rich in exoplanets.

814
01:18:30.241 --> 01:18:32.620
[Betty] For a long. long time.
I had the feeling

815
01:18:32.655 --> 01:18:36.344
that I had sort of lived
through a tragedy in some way.

816
01:18:36.379 --> 01:18:39.241
And sometimes. even now.
I still have this feeling.

817
01:18:39.275 --> 01:18:41.448
Because it's something
that's haunting.

818
01:18:42.655 --> 01:18:46.068
It's something
that's always on my mind.

819
01:18:46.103 --> 01:18:48.793
No matter where I go
or what I do.

820
01:18:48.827 --> 01:18:51.896
It's the last thing I think
of when I go to bed at night.

821
01:18:51.931 --> 01:18:56.655
And it's the first thing
I think of in the morning
when I wake up.

822
01:18:56.689 --> 01:19:01.310
And I expect
it'll probably be that way
for the rest of my life.

823
01:19:14.586 --> 01:19:18.068
Of course after this happened.
there's no doubt in my mind

824
01:19:18.103 --> 01:19:22.655
that these are real solid
crafts and they're astronauts
from another solar system

825
01:19:22.689 --> 01:19:24.379
because they told me
so themselves.

826
01:19:25.827 --> 01:19:29.275
[narrator] Today. six decades
after their UFO encounter...

827
01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:34.310
Betty Hill and her husband.
Barney are no longer with us.

828
01:19:39.172 --> 01:19:42.379
They are buried together
beside Betty's sister. Janet

829
01:19:42.413 --> 01:19:46.206
in a small picturesque
cemetery in Kingston.
New Hampshire.

830
01:19:49.793 --> 01:19:53.827
[Jim] These were
two people. long ago.
who lived in Portsmouth...

831
01:19:56.275 --> 01:19:58.862
who have now passed on.

832
01:19:58.896 --> 01:20:03.000
But they've left us
with a message of something
they experienced.

833
01:20:06.896 --> 01:20:11.517
There are aliens out there
who may be visiting us.

834
01:20:11.551 --> 01:20:15.551
might not be harmful.
might want to know about us.

835
01:20:15.586 --> 01:20:17.724
might want to examine us...

836
01:20:19.206 --> 01:20:23.241
and may just want to be
inquisitive about
what we're about.

837
01:20:23.275 --> 01:20:25.724
And maybe someday.
who knows when.

838
01:20:25.758 --> 01:20:28.413
But maybe someday.
they're going to say
hello.

839
01:21:00.103 --> 01:21:02.931
[Betty] The good question is.
why are they coming here?

840
01:21:02.965 --> 01:21:05.793
I don't think the government
knows any more than we do.

841
01:21:05.827 --> 01:21:07.620
They're just as puzzled
as we are.

842
01:21:09.310 --> 01:21:10.896
I mean. we know they're here.

843
01:21:10.931 --> 01:21:13.413
We know there are beings
on board.

844
01:21:13.448 --> 01:21:14.931
We don't know
why they're here.

845
01:21:16.172 --> 01:21:20.827
[conversation over PA]

846
01:21:23.310 --> 01:21:26.172
[narrator] This question of
why recently resurfaced

847
01:21:26.206 --> 01:21:31.172
following the 2017 release of
the so-called Tic-tac video.

848
01:21:31.206 --> 01:21:33.620
These images
of a purported UFO

849
01:21:33.655 --> 01:21:36.034
were captured
by a navy fighter jet

850
01:21:36.068 --> 01:21:40.793
and radar on board
the nuclear-powered aircraft
carrier. USS Nimitz.

851
01:21:40.827 --> 01:21:44.482
[conversation over PA]

852
01:21:47.241 --> 01:21:51.448
Peace Air Force Base located
in Portsmouth. New Hampshire.
in 1961.

853
01:21:51.482 --> 01:21:54.448
was the home
of the Strategic Air Command.

854
01:21:54.482 --> 01:21:58.344
And that's where the bombers
with the nuclear bombs
were housed.

855
01:21:58.379 --> 01:22:01.586
A few years earlier. in 1947.

856
01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:05.758
the Strategic Air Command
bombers were held at Roswell.

857
01:22:08.517 --> 01:22:12.793
So UFOs. aliens.
nuclear weapons

858
01:22:12.827 --> 01:22:14.931
kind of have this thing where
they're brought together.

859
01:22:14.965 --> 01:22:17.034
which would make me say.

860
01:22:17.068 --> 01:22:21.862
it's one reason to believe
that the Betty and Barney case
might not be random.

861
01:22:21.896 --> 01:22:24.137
but might be something
that's related to that

862
01:22:24.172 --> 01:22:27.551
since they lived very close
to this nuclear bomber base.

863
01:22:29.758 --> 01:22:34.206
[narrator]
Six decades after risking
their reputations and careers.

864
01:22:34.241 --> 01:22:39.931
many. no longer view Betty
and Barney Hill as frauds.
but as heroes.

865
01:22:41.068 --> 01:22:43.275
After UFOs are generally
acknowledged.

866
01:22:43.310 --> 01:22:45.793
you can call that disclosure
or whatever you want
to call it.

867
01:22:45.827 --> 01:22:49.034
But when the world is finally
saying. yeah. these things
are real.

868
01:22:49.068 --> 01:22:51.896
then the history books are
going to have to be rewritten.

869
01:22:51.931 --> 01:22:55.206
Betty and Barney Hill.
they're going to be in
history books.

870
01:22:55.241 --> 01:22:59.965
[Ben] I always remind people.
when I hear the skepticism of.

871
01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.275
well. there's no physical
evidence.

872
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:04.344
you could have
a murder conviction

873
01:23:04.379 --> 01:23:10.241
from one or two very credible
witnesses of seeing an event.

874
01:23:10.275 --> 01:23:15.034
Imagine the implications
of that or someone goes
to prison or is put to death.

875
01:23:15.068 --> 01:23:17.413
Yet. we ridicule somebody
who says

876
01:23:17.448 --> 01:23:21.620
that they had a very
fantastical story
of a UFO report.

877
01:23:21.655 --> 01:23:26.068
But. yet. this same
credibility exists
with these witnesses.

878
01:23:26.103 --> 01:23:27.551
I think we should
start listening.

879
01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:38.137
[Kathleen] I think
that if Betty
and Barney were alive today.

880
01:23:38.172 --> 01:23:42.241
they would be satisfied that
they had been vindicated.

881
01:23:42.275 --> 01:23:47.517
We know so much more
scientifically than we knew
in that time frame.

882
01:23:47.551 --> 01:23:53.620
And Betty's and Barney's
knowledge was consistent
with what we understand today.

883
01:24:00.172 --> 01:24:02.344
I'm Betty Hill.

884
01:24:02.379 --> 01:24:08.551
and my husband. Barney
and I were the first persons
on this planet

885
01:24:08.586 --> 01:24:12.413
to be abducted by astronauts
from another solar system.
