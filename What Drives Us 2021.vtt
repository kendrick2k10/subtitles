14
00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:39.914

moments on stage

connection to other people

DAVE: All of the biggest
bands in the world.

35
00:02:03.748 --> 00:02:05.124
they had to start somewhere.

36
00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:09.254
Everybody I know started
out like this. in a van.

37
00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:14.467
Yeah.

38
00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:15.969
DAVE: You know. you're crammed

39
00:02:16.052 --> 00:02:17.345
in there together for months

40
00:02:17.428 --> 00:02:20.306
and it can be totally
fucking disgusting

41
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.393
and absolutely
beautiful all at once.

42
00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.688
And what happens in the
van is the foundation

43
00:02:26.771 --> 00:02:28.022
of who we become.

44
00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:30.024
When are we gonna eat again?
We're gonna eat

45
00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:33.736
some clown meat tonight.
Clown meat. (laughing)

46
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.072
DAVE: And it creates
this unique perspective

47
00:02:36.155 --> 00:02:37.407
that we all share.

48
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.325
So yeah. this is the van.

49
00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:40.243
It's cool.

50
00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:41.995
It's not very comfortable.

51
00:02:42.078 --> 00:02:43.913
but you make it work.

52
00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:47.208
DAVE: Personally. I don't
think that I'd still be here

53
00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:50.587
if it weren't for
those early experiences

54
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.673
touring in the van.
touring with my friends.

55
00:02:53.756 --> 00:02:57.510
If it weren't for that old
van. I don't where I'd be.

56
00:02:57.594 --> 00:02:58.678
Remember the red van that we had

57
00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:01.556
that we sold to Brain Brown?
Yeah.

58
00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:03.182
Mm-hmm. that was your first van.

59
00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:06.185
That was my first van.
Where's it now?

60
00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.437
(upbeat rock music)

61
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.230
Guess what?

62
00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:10.481
I got it back.

63
00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:16.779
(door creaks)
(Dave mimics creaking)

64
00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:19.532
(engine starts)

65
00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:23.369
I gotta be honest.

66
00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:24.287
This van

67
00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:27.665
has stood the test of time.

68
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.880
It was brand spanking
new when we got it.

69
00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:36.716
And every time I take
a right I feel like

70
00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.135
I'm gonna fall out the door.

71
00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:41.971
It didn't used to be
like that. (laughing)

72
00:03:53.816 --> 00:03:56.402
Okay. so I'm making a
movie about van touring.

73
00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:57.904
Yeah.

74
00:03:57.987 --> 00:04:00.782
DAVE: And its importance
in spreading music around

75
00:04:00.865 --> 00:04:02.492
either the country or the world.

76
00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:03.660
right?
The world. Yeah.

77
00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:05.078
DAVE: It almost pollinates.

78
00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:06.496
It's like cross-pollination.

79
00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.249
Everyone we've talked to
basically has the same story.

80
00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:11.084
The van stories.

81
00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:12.835
DAVE: People are like.

82
00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.504
especially like
these big musicians.

83
00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:16.422
they're kind of proud
that they toured-

84
00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:17.840
Absolutely. yeah.

85
00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:21.636
DAVE: I just love that I
could talk to Ringo about it.

86
00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:22.971
talk to you about it.

87
00:04:23.054 --> 00:04:24.973
talk to the drummer
of Slayer about it.

88
00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:25.932
Yes.
Talk to Ian

89
00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:27.433
Mackaye about it.

90
00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:30.853
And it seems like everybody
has the same passion

91
00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.689
and the same drive
and whatever it takes.

92
00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:33.940
Okay.

93
00:04:34.023 --> 00:04:34.941
Can I just say one thing?
Yeah.

94
00:04:35.024 --> 00:04:36.526
I realized I was thinking

95
00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:37.860
while I was driving
over here going like

96
00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:39.278
what am I walking into?

97
00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:41.030
Oh. it's about van touring.

98
00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:43.199
And so I was just
revisiting all that.

99
00:04:43.282 --> 00:04:45.994
I realized I'd actually
never toured in van.

100
00:04:46.077 --> 00:04:47.620
Okay.
So can I go now?

101
00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:50.665
Yes. And cut.
(guys laughing)

102
00:04:50.748 --> 00:04:53.459
well. no. because it's
funny when we started this

103
00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:56.462
I thought. well. there'll
be a lot of great stories

104
00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:58.715
and people talking about the
logistics of touring in a van

105
00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:01.843
and anecdotes about turning
an a van and shit like that

106
00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:04.804
but then it sort of evolved
into something bigger

107
00:05:04.887 --> 00:05:06.389
that's more about people.

108
00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:08.975
Why the fuck people
leave everything behind

109
00:05:09.058 --> 00:05:13.062
and just sort of quit life
and start playing music

110
00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:14.564
and wandering around
with their friends.

111
00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:17.358
So. but tell me your name
and where you're from.

112
00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:20.153

We were home schooled.

164
00:07:05.424 --> 00:07:07.135
so there wasn't a lot to do

165
00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:09.345
besides listen to our
dad's record collection

166
00:07:09.428 --> 00:07:10.805
and kind of hang out.

167
00:07:10.888 --> 00:07:12.515
And we just got kind of bored
and were like all right.

168
00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:14.684
we can just kind of hang
out and play music together

169
00:07:14.767 --> 00:07:16.519
and We had plenty
of time to do that.

170
00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:18.938
And then pretty much
get out of St. Joe.

171
00:07:19.021 --> 00:07:21.858

get us out of our city.

00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:40.668
There's just no
music scene. really.

180
00:07:40.751 --> 00:07:42.295
Like we had to play out of town

181
00:07:42.378 --> 00:07:44.839
because people didn't
want to book us

182
00:07:44.922 --> 00:07:48.134
because they would say that
we don't book rap groups.

183
00:07:48.217 --> 00:07:50.887
but we had a CD. so they
never listened to the CD.

184
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.346
So yeah. we just
played outside it.

185
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.473
we played Kansas City.
Kansas and all that stuff

186
00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:57.393
until at some point. someone
booked us in St. Joe.

187
00:07:57.476 --> 00:08:00.146
♪ I just can't shake it ♪

188
00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:03.399
♪ I'm gonna take them away ♪

189
00:08:03.482 --> 00:08:05.151
DAVE: So is your
dad sort of like

190
00:08:05.234 --> 00:08:08.237
the tour manager/roadie/driver?

191
00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:09.488
Yes. Yes.

192
00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:11.824
And yeah. Dad hooked us
up with all the music

193
00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:15.369
we listened to. takes us
out on the road. you know.

194
00:08:15.453 --> 00:08:16.996
takes care of us to this day.

195
00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:18.539
It's really cool

196
00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:20.583
like there's not much of a
change from being at home

197
00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:22.919
so we can stay on the road
for a really long time.

198
00:08:23.002 --> 00:08:26.255
It's just crazy I've been
doing this is for nine years.

199
00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.424
Yep.
And we're still doing it.

200
00:08:28.507 --> 00:08:29.884
(laughing)

201
00:08:29.967 --> 00:08:31.427
They told me that your
kids are gonna start a band

202
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:34.597
and you can quit your
shitty Walmart job

203
00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.766
and be on the road touring
with your favorite band

204
00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:38.100
for the rest of your life.

205
00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:40.019
Be an amazing opportunity.

206
00:08:40.102 --> 00:08:41.354
It's just craziness.

207
00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:47.360
DAVE: What's great
about Radkey's story is

208
00:08:47.443 --> 00:08:50.446
that it's not that different
from everyone I know.

209
00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:55.451
My parents decided
move to Dublin

210
00:08:55.534 --> 00:08:58.996
when I was one to this
little town called Malahide

211
00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:02.875
and that's where I grew up
with my brother and my sister.

212
00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:06.212
The one downside of
living in the burbs

213
00:09:06.295 --> 00:09:10.132
outside of Dublin city was
often not a lot going on.

214
00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:13.427
So we would have to find
other ways to amuse ourselves

215
00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:16.472
and that's when we
got into explosives.

216
00:09:16.555 --> 00:09:18.474
(dramatic music)

217
00:09:18.557 --> 00:09:20.726
And that was a kind
of interesting phase.

218
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.895
We had a couple of summers

219
00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:24.230
having great fun
blowing things up.

220
00:09:24.313 --> 00:09:26.774
You're gonna lose
your global entry.

221
00:09:26.857 --> 00:09:28.818
(The Edge laughing)

222
00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:29.986
This is probably true.

223
00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:31.320
I don't know if
we'll use that part.

224
00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:32.989
Has U2 ever used pyro?

225
00:09:33.072 --> 00:09:34.156
I feel like you've
never fucking used-

226
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.493
No. we got over that
phase. you know. age 15.

227
00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:40.246
But you know. it's
like. you know.

228
00:09:40.329 --> 00:09:43.249
you're in this nice little
town. but not a lot happening

229
00:09:43.332 --> 00:09:45.459
so things went horribly wrong

230
00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:46.669
when I discovered rock and roll.

231
00:09:46.752 --> 00:09:47.920
(laughing)

232
00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:50.089
I was trying to
remember what it was

233
00:09:50.172 --> 00:09:51.799
that got me interested
in rock and roll

234
00:09:51.882 --> 00:09:54.760
and I think it was watching
"A Hard Day's Night."

235
00:09:54.844 --> 00:09:55.594
(upbeat music)

236
00:09:55.678 --> 00:09:56.596
(audience screaming)

237
00:09:56.679 --> 00:09:59.807

238
00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:03.311

239
00:10:03.394 --> 00:10:05.771

You get to do that?

241
00:10:07.356 --> 00:10:09.817

want to do that.

(audience cheering)

248
00:10:24.957 --> 00:10:27.001
It was just that time
with the Beatles.

249
00:10:27.084 --> 00:10:29.879
the storms. everything
was starting to happen.

250
00:10:29.962 --> 00:10:31.630
Nobody knew quite
what was happening

251
00:10:31.714 --> 00:10:32.840
but it was like grunge.

252
00:10:32.923 --> 00:10:34.842
What the fuck's happened?

253
00:10:34.925 --> 00:10:35.801
What was that?

254
00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:38.179
At 15 I had to leave school

255
00:10:38.262 --> 00:10:40.473
and start an apprenticeship
in a factory.

256
00:10:40.556 --> 00:10:43.142
There was 60 kids in
this apprentice group

257
00:10:43.225 --> 00:10:45.186
and everybody was
starting bands.

258
00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:47.563
"Brian. do you want
to start a band?"

259
00:10:47.646 --> 00:10:50.900
And I said. "Yeah. I
wanna be a drummer."

260
00:10:50.983 --> 00:10:53.402
I didn't like singing.
I want to be a drummer.

261
00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:55.905
and then I went to see
how much kit of drums was

262
00:10:55.988 --> 00:10:57.698
and that was the
end of that dream.

263
00:10:57.782 --> 00:10:59.533
It was just ridiculous.

264
00:10:59.617 --> 00:11:01.077
but you never felt poor.

265
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.995
You never felt poor because
everybody else was the same.

266
00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:05.664
In fact. the only way you
could get out of there

267
00:11:05.748 --> 00:11:10.252
was if you were a good
football player or music.

268
00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:12.755
(upbeat music)

269
00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:15.674
The first time I heard something
that just (indistinct) me.

270
00:11:15.758 --> 00:11:18.344
just jumped out at me.

271
00:11:18.427 --> 00:11:21.055
thought. well. off the floor
I was about 12 or something.

272
00:11:21.138 --> 00:11:24.725
the BBC television. there
was only one channel.

273
00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:26.685
Mix through. queue on two.

274
00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:29.355
Today we have a surprise for you

275
00:11:29.438 --> 00:11:30.773
because they all
talked like that

276
00:11:30.856 --> 00:11:34.110
with this awfully
posh English accent.

277
00:11:34.193 --> 00:11:36.946
And she said. "We have a
young man from America.

278
00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:41.659
a film of this young man and
it he's called Little Richard."

279
00:11:42.618 --> 00:11:45.287
And I was going Little Richard?

280
00:11:45.371 --> 00:11:48.165
And anyway. it just come
on and there was this

281
00:11:49.875 --> 00:11:51.627
peacock of a guy. you know?

282
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:55.423
Fucking hair. the suit
and he just went...

283
00:11:55.506 --> 00:11:57.883

288
00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.479
And I just went.
"What the fuck?"

289
00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:14.567
It just turned me on me tits.

290
00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:17.778
I just couldn't believe
anybody could sing like that.

291
00:12:17.862 --> 00:12:19.989
I just. I wanna sing
like that. you know?

292
00:12:20.072 --> 00:12:23.784
♪ Bop bopa-a-lu a whop bam boo ♪

293
00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:26.454
The music we had
was the car radio.

294
00:12:26.537 --> 00:12:29.999
And there was like Ray Charles
and you know. Johnny Cash

295
00:12:30.082 --> 00:12:32.793
and the Supremes and the
Beatles eventually and all that.

296
00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:35.921
There was no connection
between that and real life.

297
00:12:36.005 --> 00:12:37.173
There was no idea
like. you know what?

298
00:12:37.256 --> 00:12:38.799
I think I'll be
in a band someday.

299
00:12:38.883 --> 00:12:40.676
Like I want to be just
like Jimi Hendrix.

300
00:12:40.759 --> 00:12:41.927
maybe I learn to play guitar.

301
00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:44.597
That didn't happen in a
rural area of Illinois.

302
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.098
You didn't feel it.

303
00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:48.767
I mean. I think it's a
lot different now. Right?

304
00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:50.269
The last thing I
ever thought of.

305
00:12:50.352 --> 00:12:53.272
probably nun.

306
00:12:53.355 --> 00:12:54.607
teacher.

307
00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:56.108
mother.

308
00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:58.861
nurse. maybe if I didn't
tell anybody. stewardess.

309
00:12:58.944 --> 00:13:00.779
(plane roaring)

310
00:13:00.863 --> 00:13:03.866
In the projects in Morrison
Lane where we lived.

311
00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:07.703
my aunts would come
over and they would just

312
00:13:07.786 --> 00:13:09.872
have a couple of drinks
and started listening

313
00:13:09.955 --> 00:13:12.124
to like R&B.

314
00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:14.210
R&B. all the Detroit
sound. all the.

315
00:13:14.293 --> 00:13:16.128
Gladys Knight & the Pips.

316
00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:18.881
The Temptations. all that
stuff that came out of Motown.

317
00:13:18.964 --> 00:13:21.133
They would all sit
around and groove to it.

318
00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:23.344
And so as little kids we
would just kind of peer in

319
00:13:23.427 --> 00:13:24.803
and like. what are they doing?

320
00:13:24.887 --> 00:13:26.680
Well. they sure seem
to be having fun.

321
00:13:26.764 --> 00:13:28.390
Russell. this father
I grew up with.

322
00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:31.727
he did buy a Danelectro guitar.

323
00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:34.063
The one that came in
the case with the amp.

324
00:13:34.146 --> 00:13:36.482
He couldn't play it. but he
would just let us play it.

325
00:13:36.565 --> 00:13:39.485
And I would just get on
it and go. woo. woo. woo

326
00:13:39.568 --> 00:13:42.738
and just try to make
a fucking sound.

327
00:13:42.821 --> 00:13:45.199
And I was like
wow. this is cool.

328
00:13:45.282 --> 00:13:46.659
It makes a sound.
It makes a sound.

329
00:13:46.742 --> 00:13:50.579
I'm just making noise
but I was fascinated.

330
00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:54.333
(upbeat drum music)

331
00:13:54.416 --> 00:13:56.877
I was in the school
band. you know.

332
00:13:56.961 --> 00:14:00.005
Learn my paradiddles and
my single stroke roles.

333
00:14:00.089 --> 00:14:03.050
you know. just the basics.
but I got tired of it.

334
00:14:03.133 --> 00:14:06.595
And I felt that listening
to Zeppelin. you know.

335
00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:08.847
listening to the
Stones. you know.

336
00:14:08.931 --> 00:14:13.602
I learned more about
rhythm and song structure

337
00:14:13.686 --> 00:14:16.438
and melody than
somebody sitting there

338
00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:18.274
teaching me his own way.

339
00:14:18.357 --> 00:14:20.359
I wanted to have
a band by the time

340
00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.862
I got my first drum kit.

341
00:14:23.946 --> 00:14:27.116
That had to have been
like eighth grade.

342
00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:30.244
I got a drum kit when
I was maybe 11 or 12.

343
00:14:30.327 --> 00:14:31.870
And I would sit. I had
it modeled master after

344
00:14:31.954 --> 00:14:36.083
Ian Paice and John Coghlan.
the guy from Status Quo.

345
00:14:36.166 --> 00:14:37.793
My friends would come over.

346
00:14:37.876 --> 00:14:40.963
We'd take some tennis
rackets. they would do guitar.

347
00:14:41.046 --> 00:14:44.258
And then we would. we had
these. it was like an old house.

348
00:14:44.341 --> 00:14:47.052
It had like old school radiators

349
00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:48.971
and we would turn
the radiators up

350
00:14:49.054 --> 00:14:50.723
and then we would.
don't tell anybody this.

351
00:14:50.806 --> 00:14:52.725
We'd take our shirts off

352
00:14:52.808 --> 00:14:55.728
and then we would like sweat
and we would be on stage

353
00:14:55.811 --> 00:14:58.522
and we would be like in a
rock band. it was so cool.

354
00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:02.651
All right. we have to
cut it all the way back

355
00:15:02.735 --> 00:15:07.740
because my neighbors
were core punk rockers.

356
00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:10.784
They had the garage band

357
00:15:10.868 --> 00:15:13.996
in the 80s that drove
the entire neighborhood

358
00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:16.165
property values down.

359
00:15:16.248 --> 00:15:19.668
Pierced cheeks. mohawks
to the moon. right?

360
00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:22.921
And they actually had a super
influential punk rock band

361
00:15:23.005 --> 00:15:25.424
at the time called

362
00:15:28.177 --> 00:15:29.261
Christian Death.

363
00:15:29.345 --> 00:15:30.512
Those were your neighbors?
Yeah.

364
00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:32.306
Christian Death
were my neighbors.

365
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:34.016
So they would hear me playing

366
00:15:34.099 --> 00:15:37.186
like Casey Kasem
pop music next door.

367
00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:40.522
So I'd be blasting that
right out the window

368
00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:42.024
where they'd be
trying to rehearse.

369
00:15:42.107 --> 00:15:46.195
So one time they finally just
came in and mobbed me. right?

370
00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:50.115
So they came in. pulled
the wires on my receiver

371
00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:52.117
and just said. "Here.

372
00:15:52.201 --> 00:15:54.411
You need to start here. man.

373
00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:57.790
Here is a Clash record.

374
00:15:57.873 --> 00:16:00.542
Here is Paul Weller in The Jam.

375
00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:02.294
A handful of records. here.

376
00:16:02.378 --> 00:16:05.047
This is what. let's
start listening to this."

377
00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:08.133
I never had an older
brother or sister

378
00:16:08.217 --> 00:16:12.471
so my musical experiences
where. you know.

379
00:16:12.554 --> 00:16:15.224
I would gravitate to.
like Prince is my favorite

380
00:16:15.307 --> 00:16:18.644
and still to this
day is my favorite.

381
00:16:18.727 --> 00:16:22.231
And when I got in No Doubt.

382
00:16:22.314 --> 00:16:24.316
Eric Stefani. who
started the band

383
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.402
and the rest of the guys.
Chris Webb and all these guys

384
00:16:26.485 --> 00:16:27.653
exposed me like to the great.

385
00:16:27.736 --> 00:16:30.572
it was just like this
incredible moment

386
00:16:30.656 --> 00:16:33.075
of just like (upbeat music)

387
00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:35.494
Fishbone and Bad
Brains and the Peppers

388
00:16:35.577 --> 00:16:37.579
and everything at that time.

389
00:16:37.663 --> 00:16:39.498
And I was a sponge and it was
just like (mimics explosion).

390
00:16:39.581 --> 00:16:41.417
my whole world changed.

391
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:42.710
♪ Party at ground zero ♪

392
00:16:42.793 --> 00:16:45.045

DAVE: Do you feel like
you're musically inclined?

394
00:16:47.423 --> 00:16:49.341
I don't know if I ever
gave that much of a thought

395
00:16:49.425 --> 00:16:51.427
like I just enjoyed
it and it was fun

396
00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:54.179
and I'd kind of found a
thing and I was doing it.

397
00:16:55.848 --> 00:16:57.516
and I kept doing it.

398
00:16:57.599 --> 00:17:00.102
(upbeat music)

399
00:17:06.775 --> 00:17:08.193
The story of how U2 formed.

400
00:17:08.277 --> 00:17:11.572
having learned basic guitar
playing. like real basic.

401
00:17:11.655 --> 00:17:13.365
I had this idea that
maybe at some point

402
00:17:13.449 --> 00:17:15.868
I would join a garage band.

403
00:17:15.951 --> 00:17:19.204
A junior pupil had a drum kit
and he wants to form a band

404
00:17:19.288 --> 00:17:22.458
and had put a note on the
notice board of the school

405
00:17:23.834 --> 00:17:24.960
for musicians.

406
00:17:25.043 --> 00:17:28.714
So I found the note.

407
00:17:28.797 --> 00:17:31.800
took down the phone number.
called this young guy.

408
00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:33.594
Larry Mullen was his name.

409
00:17:33.677 --> 00:17:36.263
Found out there was a
meeting in his house.

410
00:17:36.346 --> 00:17:37.639
At that first meeting.
were all members of U2

411
00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:39.725
with like three other people.

412
00:17:39.808 --> 00:17:41.977
We started all
gathering instruments

413
00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:43.979
and then we got a
chance to play together.

414
00:17:44.062 --> 00:17:47.649
And that's when we realized that

415
00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:48.901
we had a lot of work
to do. (laughing)

416
00:17:48.984 --> 00:17:51.278
It was. it was just cacophony.

417
00:17:51.361 --> 00:17:54.406
No one could play in time.
no one could play in tune.

418
00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:56.658
it was not good.

419
00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:58.285
But I don't know what.

420
00:17:58.368 --> 00:18:00.496
we just decided to persevere.

421
00:18:00.579 --> 00:18:04.833
Over weeks and months slowly.
something starts to gel.

422
00:18:06.335 --> 00:18:09.922
Our slow increase in skill
suddenly met the Ramones.

423
00:18:10.005 --> 00:18:14.676
♪ Well. the girls are
frisky in old 'Frisco ♪

424

426
00:18:20.182 --> 00:18:22.351
And we. that's it.
this is the answer.

427
00:18:22.434 --> 00:18:25.187
This is the music
we need to play.

428
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:28.482
Simple. heavy cord guitar.

429
00:18:28.565 --> 00:18:29.775
But it's punk rock.

430
00:18:29.858 --> 00:18:31.276

(audience applauding)

435
00:18:40.452 --> 00:18:42.371
I know when I talked to
you about music before.

436
00:18:42.454 --> 00:18:44.873
you grew up loving classic rock.

437
00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:46.125
Good. great rock bands.

438
00:18:46.208 --> 00:18:46.959
Great drummers.

439
00:18:47.042 --> 00:18:48.460
You loved Zeppelin.

440
00:18:48.544 --> 00:18:50.879
You loved. you know. the great
rock band. Sabbath. you know.

441
00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:53.465
And for me. like when I
was a kid. I was just like.

442
00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:55.467
"Rock music is for dumb people.

443
00:18:55.551 --> 00:18:57.386
Rock music is for
people who like haircuts

444
00:18:57.469 --> 00:19:00.722
and clothes and they
don't care about music."

445
00:19:00.806 --> 00:19:05.060
You know. when I was a kid.
my life was very tumultuous.

446
00:19:05.144 --> 00:19:07.521
I was a complete
fuck up in school.

447
00:19:07.604 --> 00:19:10.065
I started doing drugs
when I was 11 years old.

448
00:19:10.148 --> 00:19:11.567
You know. I was
scared to be home.

449
00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:14.486
My stepdad was a junky
and wild and violent

450
00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:16.905
and it wasn't a safe
place. you know?

451
00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:21.869
And the one thing was I got
to play music in school.

452
00:19:21.952 --> 00:19:23.161
and I played trumpet.

453
00:19:23.245 --> 00:19:24.913
I had dreams of being
a jazz trumpet player

454
00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:27.666
or playing in a great symphony
orchestra when I grew up.

455
00:19:27.749 --> 00:19:30.335
and the feeling that I had
when I held that fucking thing

456
00:19:30.419 --> 00:19:32.671
to my lips and blew on it

457
00:19:32.754 --> 00:19:35.424
was like all the
chaos. all the fear.

458
00:19:35.507 --> 00:19:37.259
all the like hung over
because it was a crazy night

459
00:19:37.342 --> 00:19:38.886
and the cops came to my house

460
00:19:38.969 --> 00:19:41.221
and my stepdad just
shooting at them

461
00:19:41.305 --> 00:19:42.681
and threatening to kill himself.

462
00:19:42.764 --> 00:19:45.392
like all this stuff
all disappeared.

463
00:19:45.475 --> 00:19:46.852
(sirens wailing)

464
00:19:46.935 --> 00:19:48.520
And in that moment of playing.

465
00:19:48.604 --> 00:19:51.356
and like when I felt like
I made a beautiful sound.

466
00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.234
it was like. in that moment.
everything was all right.

467
00:19:54.318 --> 00:19:56.987
(trumpet music)

468
00:19:59.698 --> 00:20:01.700
I'll never forget.
I was like 18.

469
00:20:01.783 --> 00:20:06.788
And at 18. you are allowed to
do night shift at the factory.

470
00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:11.293
Night shift meant
you got double wages.

471
00:20:11.376 --> 00:20:12.419
Okay?

472
00:20:12.502 --> 00:20:14.296
And it was four nights a week

473
00:20:14.379 --> 00:20:16.882
and it was from nine
o'clock at night

474
00:20:16.965 --> 00:20:19.885
until something
the next morning.

475
00:20:19.968 --> 00:20:21.762
I was walking in with
me little hopper sack on

476
00:20:21.845 --> 00:20:23.221
with two other guys.

477
00:20:24.389 --> 00:20:27.100
And the sun. there was
actually a sunny sky

478
00:20:27.184 --> 00:20:28.310
and it was setting in

479
00:20:28.393 --> 00:20:30.979
and there was a big
orange glow in the sky

480
00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:34.232
and I stopped and looked
and I'm like (sighs).

481
00:20:34.316 --> 00:20:35.817
And he went. "What's
wrong with you?"

482
00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:38.987
And I said. "Just think
about the all of the things

483
00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:40.572
people are doing
around the world.

484
00:20:40.656 --> 00:20:44.159
and we're gonna walk into
that big black hole there

485
00:20:44.242 --> 00:20:47.996
and spend the night
working on that shit.

486
00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:50.749
And I don't want to do it."

487
00:20:50.832 --> 00:20:52.668
And they just looked at me.

488
00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:56.046
Mad. mad as a
(indistinct) and I was.

489
00:20:57.255 --> 00:20:58.507
I rather be out there
than going in here.

490
00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:00.175
earning double time.

491
00:21:06.014 --> 00:21:07.933
In my family. music
was the movement.

492
00:21:08.016 --> 00:21:10.102
Music was the revolution.

493
00:21:10.185 --> 00:21:12.604
You know. music
was social justice

494
00:21:12.688 --> 00:21:13.939
and social change and cultural.

495
00:21:14.022 --> 00:21:15.774
There's a lot that went into it.

496
00:21:15.857 --> 00:21:17.609
more than it just being music.

497
00:21:17.693 --> 00:21:19.027
You know. when you
have that moment

498
00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:20.654
where it kind of clarifies
who you want to be

499
00:21:20.737 --> 00:21:22.990
and what you want to do
and how you want to do it.

500
00:21:23.073 --> 00:21:24.950
And I heard Mississippi
John Hurt for the first time

501
00:21:25.033 --> 00:21:26.451
and I asked my
grandmother. I said.

502
00:21:26.535 --> 00:21:28.453
"Grandma. who were these guys?

503
00:21:28.537 --> 00:21:29.705
Who were these
two guys playing?"

504
00:21:29.788 --> 00:21:31.039
She's like. "No. no.
it's just one guy."

505
00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:32.207
You know. one thing
with the thumb.

506
00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:33.959
bass with the thumb.
melody with the fingers.

507
00:21:34.042 --> 00:21:35.836
I just. I just. that was it.

508
00:21:35.919 --> 00:21:37.796
I had to do that.

509
00:21:37.879 --> 00:21:41.216
How old were you?
19.

00:21:53.311 --> 00:21:56.231
because they want to. you know.

515
00:21:56.314 --> 00:21:59.484
be in the band and
travel and see the world.

516
00:21:59.568 --> 00:22:01.653
But with you. it seems
like you were really

517
00:22:01.737 --> 00:22:02.988
kind of born into it.

518
00:22:03.071 --> 00:22:05.657
I've been playing 75 years.

519
00:22:06.658 --> 00:22:08.368
And I learned off the road.

520
00:22:08.452 --> 00:22:10.662
the road taught me how to live.

521
00:22:10.746 --> 00:22:11.663
(upbeat music)

522
00:22:11.747 --> 00:22:13.415
Well. my name is
Charles Gabriel.

523
00:22:13.498 --> 00:22:15.167
I'm from to the
city of New Orleans.

524
00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:16.418
the great city of New Orleans.

525
00:22:16.501 --> 00:22:18.670
And my grandfather was
born in New Orleans

526
00:22:18.754 --> 00:22:21.506
and he was a cornet player.

527
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:24.342
And he had The National
the jazz band in 1920.

528
00:22:24.426 --> 00:22:25.927
And my father born
in New Orleans too

529
00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:31.016
and he was a drummer and
my father had five boys.

530
00:22:31.933 --> 00:22:34.269
five of us and five girls.

531
00:22:34.352 --> 00:22:38.732
And my mother and them decided
to go to Detroit in 1941.

532
00:22:38.815 --> 00:22:41.526
My dad told my mother. he said.

533
00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:43.028
"You can to take
them all to Detroit

534
00:22:43.111 --> 00:22:46.114
but you can't take Charlie.
'cause I'm teaching Charlie."

535
00:22:46.198 --> 00:22:48.784
Because he was teaching
me about seven years

536
00:22:48.867 --> 00:22:50.702
before I was able
to go to Detroit

537
00:22:50.786 --> 00:22:51.870
and join the rest of my family.

538
00:22:51.953 --> 00:22:54.289
And that's what I wanted to do.

539
00:22:54.372 --> 00:22:57.042
I wanted to become a musician.

540
00:22:57.125 --> 00:22:59.795
I prayed to God that I
can become a musician

541
00:22:59.878 --> 00:23:03.590
to qualify to play music
anywhere in the universe.

542
00:23:03.673 --> 00:23:05.717
To me it was it was just normal.

543
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:14.476
DAVE: When did you
become a musician?

544
00:23:16.978 --> 00:23:18.939
That's hopefully in a
couple of years from now.

545
00:23:19.022 --> 00:23:20.398
We're very close.

546
00:23:20.482 --> 00:23:23.235
There may be actually a
record deal around the corner

547
00:23:23.318 --> 00:23:26.488
which could make this Metallic
thing really take off.

548
00:23:26.571 --> 00:23:28.907
I know some people.
just so you know.

549
00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:32.494
Every Thursday there was
three hours of learning

550
00:23:32.577 --> 00:23:34.663
about religion
and about history.

551
00:23:35.831 --> 00:23:37.457
religious history
in the Danish school

552
00:23:37.541 --> 00:23:41.086
so we would go to
the Lutheran church

553
00:23:41.169 --> 00:23:42.629
down the street from the school.

554
00:23:42.712 --> 00:23:45.966
And I remember
clearly the priest

555
00:23:46.049 --> 00:23:49.261
going through everybody
and talking to them about

556
00:23:49.344 --> 00:23:51.304
what they imagined
their future being.

557
00:23:51.388 --> 00:23:54.266
And sitting there.
when it was my turn.

558
00:23:54.349 --> 00:23:57.310
I said. "I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

559
00:23:57.394 --> 00:24:00.522
but I know it's gonna
involve traveling

560
00:24:00.605 --> 00:24:03.650
and it's not gonna be
something that's stationary."

561
00:24:03.733 --> 00:24:04.860
(upbeat music)

562
00:24:04.943 --> 00:24:06.111
DAVE: When did you
move to America?

563
00:24:06.194 --> 00:24:07.362
I was 17.

564
00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:11.950
I put an ad in The
Recycler and I said.

565
00:24:12.033 --> 00:24:14.536
"Drummer. looking for
other people to perform

566
00:24:14.619 --> 00:24:15.996
hard rock heavy
metal band with."

567
00:24:16.079 --> 00:24:18.790
And then about six months
later. I got a call

568
00:24:18.874 --> 00:24:20.709
from a guy named James Hetfield.

569
00:24:20.792 --> 00:24:22.961
We became friends.

570
00:24:23.044 --> 00:24:26.882
When we became friends
and he sort of got bit

571
00:24:26.965 --> 00:24:28.967
by the new wave of British
heavy metal bug also.

572
00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:32.387
I mean. he was into Aerosmith
and Scorpions and Judas Priest

573
00:24:32.471 --> 00:24:33.513
and Iron Maiden and so on.

574
00:24:33.597 --> 00:24:35.348
but he didn't really know

575
00:24:35.432 --> 00:24:39.144
about Hollow Ground.
about Sledgehammer.

576
00:24:39.227 --> 00:24:41.479
And so when we've gone
into all that stuff

577
00:24:41.563 --> 00:24:44.733
he got sort of
obsessed with it also.

578
00:24:44.816 --> 00:24:47.569
And then it was
like. what can we do?

579
00:24:47.652 --> 00:24:50.322
And maybe we should start
writing our own songs

580
00:24:50.405 --> 00:24:53.325
and all that started happening.

581
00:24:53.408 --> 00:24:55.994
DAVE: Is this the only band
you've really ever been in?

582
00:24:56.077 --> 00:24:58.663
Metallica's the only band
I've ever been in. yes.

583
00:24:58.747 --> 00:24:59.706
(Dave laughing)

584
00:24:59.789 --> 00:25:00.665
What a dick.

585
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:03.752
How many years have
you been together?

586
00:25:03.835 --> 00:25:05.378
Well.

587
00:25:05.462 --> 00:25:07.589
if you count the earlier years.

588
00:25:07.672 --> 00:25:09.424
it's over 40 years.

589
00:25:10.467 --> 00:25:12.427
Yeah. It's a long time.

590
00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:13.720
It's like a fucking
arranged marriage.

591
00:25:13.803 --> 00:25:15.764
(The Edge laughing)

592
00:25:15.847 --> 00:25:17.390
What the fuck.
Yeah.

593
00:25:17.474 --> 00:25:19.392
How long before you actually
got in front of people

594
00:25:19.476 --> 00:25:20.435
and played a song?

595
00:25:20.519 --> 00:25:23.188
We were probably a year.

596
00:25:23.271 --> 00:25:25.941
I would think. or certainly
the guts of a year

597
00:25:26.024 --> 00:25:29.861
before we had the courage
to play in front of anyone.

598
00:25:29.945 --> 00:25:34.950
And it was a small gig in
the gymnasium of the school.

599
00:25:35.825 --> 00:25:37.410
Having like argued for ages

600
00:25:37.494 --> 00:25:39.120
about what we were gonna play.

601
00:25:39.204 --> 00:25:42.290
we ended up voting for a
song that Bono sang the best

602
00:25:42.374 --> 00:25:44.459
which was a Peter Frampton
song of all things.

603
00:25:44.542 --> 00:25:45.585
"Show Me the Way."

604
00:25:45.669 --> 00:25:49.631
♪ I wonder how you're feeling ♪

605
00:25:49.714 --> 00:25:52.133
♪ There's ringing in my ears ♪

606
00:25:52.217 --> 00:25:55.637
So we played "Show Me the
Way" and Bono nailed it.

607
00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.930
He's sang it really well

608
00:25:57.013 --> 00:26:00.809
and we kind of played
in tune and in time

609
00:26:00.892 --> 00:26:04.062
and the whole gymnasium
went completely bezerk.

610
00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.565
And I think that was
kind of the light went on

611
00:26:07.649 --> 00:26:09.067
pretty much at that moment.

612
00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:12.070
Everyone just went wow.

613
00:26:12.153 --> 00:26:14.990
No one really picks
up a guitar and says.

614
00:26:15.073 --> 00:26:17.200
"I want a million
dollar record contract."

615
00:26:18.326 --> 00:26:20.078
You pick up a guitar
and yeah. it'd be great

616
00:26:20.161 --> 00:26:21.496
to be able to feed your pie hole

617
00:26:21.579 --> 00:26:23.581
but people are responding
to the relationship

618
00:26:23.665 --> 00:26:27.085
you have with
yourself. your own soul

619
00:26:27.168 --> 00:26:28.586
and how it reflects to them.

620
00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:30.505
And they're responding
to the connection

621
00:26:30.588 --> 00:26:32.757
and commitment to the
sound you're making.

622
00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:35.885
The next logical step is

623
00:26:37.554 --> 00:26:38.680
you put a band together

624
00:26:40.015 --> 00:26:41.182
and get in a van.

625
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:43.852
And go out and
conquer the world.

626
00:26:43.935 --> 00:26:46.563
(upbeat music)

627
00:26:47.897 --> 00:26:52.902

DAVE: Every band story is unique

635
00:27:12.589 --> 00:27:16.134
but on some level
they're all the same.

636
00:27:16.217 --> 00:27:17.635
It's about connection.

637
00:27:17.719 --> 00:27:19.554
What were some of
the first gigs like?

638
00:27:19.637 --> 00:27:21.473
Well. our first
gig ever actually

639
00:27:21.556 --> 00:27:24.851
a band dropped off of a
Fishbone gig in Kansas.

640
00:27:24.934 --> 00:27:27.729
♪ Oh ♪

641
00:27:27.812 --> 00:27:29.564

You say it!

643
00:27:32.484 --> 00:27:34.152
The first gig ever was
super big and awesome.

644
00:27:34.235 --> 00:27:36.237
We were like. "Whoa. we gotta
book another gig like now.

645
00:27:36.321 --> 00:27:37.739
We're huge. Let's do this.

646
00:27:37.822 --> 00:27:41.826
And then next gig. fucking
like five people. you know?

647
00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:43.370
It was like the best because
then you never gave up

648
00:27:43.453 --> 00:27:44.746
because you're like. dude.

649
00:27:44.829 --> 00:27:46.915
'cause it can be
that first show.

650
00:27:46.998 --> 00:27:50.001
That show kind of showed
us that. you know.

651
00:27:50.085 --> 00:27:52.420
we could get to there someday.

652
00:27:52.504 --> 00:27:54.339
Like for real. you know.

653
00:27:54.422 --> 00:27:57.926
The few shows after
that was like oh.

654
00:27:58.009 --> 00:27:59.177
back to reality.

655
00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:02.347
(upbeat rock music)

656
00:28:04.849 --> 00:28:06.101
Touring is hard.
Mm-hmm.

657
00:28:06.184 --> 00:28:07.685
But you just can't find anything

658
00:28:07.769 --> 00:28:10.772
like pulling into a truck
stop at three in the morning.

659
00:28:10.855 --> 00:28:11.940
There's no way.

660
00:28:12.023 --> 00:28:14.192
Also touring is
such a necessity now

661
00:28:14.275 --> 00:28:18.238
because it's the only
real exposure you can get.

662
00:28:18.321 --> 00:28:21.032
(soft music)

663
00:28:21.116 --> 00:28:23.785
MAN: Load in at two o'clock.

664
00:28:26.329 --> 00:28:27.622
DAVE: You know.
when you're young

665
00:28:27.705 --> 00:28:29.874
and you pick up an instrument
for the first time.

666
00:28:29.958 --> 00:28:32.877
you really don't
imagine that someday

667
00:28:32.961 --> 00:28:35.088
you'll be the one
writing the songs

668
00:28:35.171 --> 00:28:39.050
and you'll be the one traveling
the country or the world

669
00:28:39.134 --> 00:28:42.053
sharing your music
with other people.

670
00:28:43.179 --> 00:28:45.390
What song are you gonna
open with tonight?

671
00:28:45.473 --> 00:28:46.975
DAVE: Uh. I don't
know the name of it.

672
00:28:47.058 --> 00:28:49.894
What's the name?
Oh. I'm sorry.

673
00:28:49.978 --> 00:28:51.604
DAVE: But then once
you start sharing it

674
00:28:51.688 --> 00:28:52.814
with other people

675
00:28:52.897 --> 00:28:55.650
and you see the
joy that it brings

676
00:28:55.733 --> 00:28:58.903
and you see the love and
everyone singing along

677
00:28:58.987 --> 00:29:02.073
and dancing. and that
becomes your mission.

678
00:29:02.157 --> 00:29:04.659
The connection to the
audience becomes your mission.

679
00:29:04.742 --> 00:29:06.953
(audience cheering)

680
00:29:07.036 --> 00:29:08.913
We're the Foo Fighters.

681
00:29:10.331 --> 00:29:13.251
This is the first
show of our tour.

682
00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:18.923
And we're gonna do a song
that we wrote three ago.

683
00:29:19.007 --> 00:29:22.927
To kick off our first
part of the tour.

684
00:29:23.011 --> 00:29:24.846
It's called "My Hero."

685
00:29:24.929 --> 00:29:26.598
(upbeat music)

686
00:29:26.681 --> 00:29:31.436
It's one of the reasons why
I still have the first van

687
00:29:31.519 --> 00:29:33.104
that the Foo Fighters toured in.

688
00:29:34.272 --> 00:29:36.900
I'm thankful that I
had those experiences

689
00:29:38.359 --> 00:29:42.655
just trying to get
the gear up on stage.

690
00:29:42.739 --> 00:29:44.949
be the best band
anyone's ever seen.

691
00:29:45.033 --> 00:29:47.952
get it back in the van and
make it to the next city.

692
00:29:48.036 --> 00:29:51.289
♪ There goes my hero ♪

693
00:29:51.372 --> 00:29:54.626
♪ Watch him as he goes ♪

694
00:29:54.709 --> 00:29:56.294
Because there's no guarantee

695
00:29:57.253 --> 00:29:59.214
that it will ever pay off.

696
00:30:01.591 --> 00:30:05.178
The reward has to
be the experience.

697
00:30:05.261 --> 00:30:07.305
Without there being
any career aspiration.

698
00:30:07.388 --> 00:30:08.806
why on earth would you do it?

699
00:30:11.226 --> 00:30:13.228
It's a drive to see other places

700
00:30:13.311 --> 00:30:14.896
and have different experiences.

701
00:30:14.979 --> 00:30:17.065
I mean. I think that was
part of American culture.

702
00:30:17.148 --> 00:30:18.316
That was one of the
really great things

703
00:30:18.399 --> 00:30:20.735
that was handed down
to us was this idea

704
00:30:20.818 --> 00:30:23.029
that you could go hitchhike.
you could go on a bus.

705
00:30:23.112 --> 00:30:25.573
you could go do all this stuff

706
00:30:25.657 --> 00:30:27.992
and see other parts of America

707
00:30:28.076 --> 00:30:30.995
which were different
than where you grew up.

708
00:30:31.079 --> 00:30:32.497
So I'm in a band.

709
00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:35.166
What would you say I would
have to do to make it?

710
00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:38.211
How many thousands of
times have you heard that?

711
00:30:38.294 --> 00:30:39.754
What's the answer?

712
00:30:39.837 --> 00:30:43.258
Well. you gotta. which will
be very hard to do nowadays.

713
00:30:43.341 --> 00:30:48.346
but you got to play clubs
until you can't anymore.

714
00:30:49.264 --> 00:30:50.098
Because you played clubs.

715
00:30:50.181 --> 00:30:52.100
not until you didn't want to.

716
00:30:52.183 --> 00:30:55.019
you had to until you got good.

717
00:30:55.103 --> 00:30:57.438
I will still to this day
talk to the band and go.

718
00:30:57.522 --> 00:31:00.525
"You guys. we have to
have a meeting together.

719
00:31:00.608 --> 00:31:01.943
Stop bullshit phone and lawyers.

720
00:31:02.026 --> 00:31:04.362
we gotta just get together."

721
00:31:04.445 --> 00:31:06.281
Because that's what this was.

722
00:31:06.364 --> 00:31:07.949
We would talk about
the show afterwards.

723
00:31:08.032 --> 00:31:11.369
you ride down the road and
suddenly it's fucking snowing.

724
00:31:11.452 --> 00:31:13.079
This is what we had.

725
00:31:13.162 --> 00:31:14.038
Look at those.

726
00:31:14.122 --> 00:31:16.541
Those are the windshield wipers.

727
00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:18.543
The fuck.

728
00:31:18.626 --> 00:31:21.045
You have to pound the payment.

729
00:31:21.129 --> 00:31:22.046
You have to put in the miles.

730
00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:24.799
There's no way to recreate

731
00:31:24.882 --> 00:31:29.554
or even initially create
that type of momentum

732
00:31:29.637 --> 00:31:34.642
without getting behind
the wheel of a vehicle.

733
00:31:35.476 --> 00:31:36.644
What used to be our Thomas Guide

734
00:31:36.728 --> 00:31:38.229
is now just a push
of a button. right?

735
00:31:38.313 --> 00:31:40.315
But you still have
to follow directions.

736
00:31:40.398 --> 00:31:42.734
follow instructions to
get to where you're going.

737
00:31:42.817 --> 00:31:45.653
I mean. nobody would
ever want to get in a van

738
00:31:45.737 --> 00:31:49.824
with their families and
drive for 20 minutes. right?

739
00:31:49.907 --> 00:31:51.451
But here you are and here we are

740
00:31:51.534 --> 00:31:54.579
getting in a Ford Econoline van

741
00:31:56.748 --> 00:31:57.999
and setting sail

742
00:32:00.418 --> 00:32:02.420
with complete strangers.

743
00:32:04.088 --> 00:32:05.673
For that moment.

744
00:32:06.674 --> 00:32:08.092
that is the dream.

745
00:32:08.176 --> 00:32:11.429
(upbeat music)

746
00:32:11.512 --> 00:32:12.680
You're pirates.

747
00:32:12.764 --> 00:32:16.434
Like you're fucking
pirates and you have

748
00:32:16.517 --> 00:32:19.937
decided that this is
gonna be your life

749
00:32:20.021 --> 00:32:23.107
and you don't see any
other alternatives.

750
00:32:23.191 --> 00:32:25.443
It's not like. well. I'll
do this for a little bit

751
00:32:25.526 --> 00:32:27.695
before I start my data entry job

752
00:32:27.779 --> 00:32:31.991
it really was like a clear
delineation of like okay.

753
00:32:32.075 --> 00:32:35.370
you're a freak and you're
choosing a crazy thing.

754
00:32:35.453 --> 00:32:39.457
And this is the straight life
over here and you swerved.

755
00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:42.168
♪ How can anybody have you ♪

756
00:32:42.251 --> 00:32:44.879
♪ How can anybody have
you and lose you ♪

757
00:32:44.962 --> 00:32:47.173
♪ How can anybody have
you and lose you ♪

758
00:32:47.256 --> 00:32:49.801
♪ And not lose
their minds. too ♪

759
00:32:49.884 --> 00:32:54.472
By week four or week five.
or sometimes even day five.

760
00:32:54.555 --> 00:32:58.559
you just get this sort
of tour crazies where

761
00:33:00.436 --> 00:33:04.232
you are part zombie
from the routine.

762
00:33:04.315 --> 00:33:06.317
like a cooped up little kid

763
00:33:06.401 --> 00:33:08.319
because you've been
sitting for eight hours

764
00:33:08.403 --> 00:33:10.446
or whatever in the
van so you just

765
00:33:11.489 --> 00:33:13.324
want to freak out.

766
00:33:13.408 --> 00:33:16.077
And it helps.

767
00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:19.372
It helps to have people
you can freak out with.

768
00:33:19.455 --> 00:33:24.335
I think a lot of the attraction

769
00:33:24.419 --> 00:33:26.587
to doing this was the unknown.

770
00:33:26.671 --> 00:33:28.589
Just not knowing. You know?

771
00:33:28.673 --> 00:33:30.007
You grow up. you live your life

772
00:33:30.091 --> 00:33:34.762
with certain responsibilities
and rules and routines.

773
00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:40.768
This to me seemed like it
just went against all of that.

774
00:33:41.686 --> 00:33:42.687
That you're free.

775
00:33:43.688 --> 00:33:44.856
You know?

776
00:33:44.939 --> 00:33:47.275
When the Foo Fighters
first started as a band.

777
00:33:47.358 --> 00:33:48.693
anyone that interviewed us

778
00:33:49.861 --> 00:33:52.155
really just wanted to
talk about our past.

779
00:33:53.781 --> 00:33:55.366
INTERVIEWER: The impetus
to create some stuff

780
00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:56.951
was not stemming at
all from Kurt's death

781
00:33:57.034 --> 00:33:58.202
but it was actually stemming

782
00:33:58.286 --> 00:33:59.746
from the fact that
Nirvana broke up.

783
00:33:59.829 --> 00:34:01.539
DAVE: Shit. it's a surprise
when anyone commits suicide

784
00:34:01.622 --> 00:34:03.750
even if they say they're
gonna do it. look at Darby.

785
00:34:03.833 --> 00:34:05.042
Yeah.

786
00:34:05.126 --> 00:34:06.544
Yeah. (laughing)

787
00:34:06.627 --> 00:34:08.212
DAVE: What? What was that?

788
00:34:08.296 --> 00:34:10.631
Just yeah. I'm not
interested in this part.

789
00:34:10.715 --> 00:34:12.425
And did you look
at sitting at home

790
00:34:12.508 --> 00:34:13.634
was a period of
mourning kind of thing

791
00:34:13.718 --> 00:34:14.969
and then then Foo
Fighters is it now.

792
00:34:15.052 --> 00:34:18.473
Well. of course. but yeah.

793
00:34:19.390 --> 00:34:20.725
Yeah. sure.

794
00:34:20.808 --> 00:34:24.395
We kind of felt like we needed
to have some experiences

795
00:34:24.479 --> 00:34:26.481
of our own. you know.

796
00:34:26.564 --> 00:34:27.565
go out and do stuff.

797
00:34:30.151 --> 00:34:30.985
So.

798
00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:34.155
the van just made perfect sense.

799
00:34:35.031 --> 00:34:36.157
We went on our first tour.

800
00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:38.493
It was. I mean.
it was bare bones.

801
00:34:38.576 --> 00:34:39.994
It wasn't. there was no

802
00:34:41.245 --> 00:34:44.290
rock royalty superstar review.

803
00:34:44.373 --> 00:34:45.374
I mean. it was like.

804
00:34:46.417 --> 00:34:48.503
we were hurting. you know?

805
00:34:48.586 --> 00:34:51.088
Look at Pat's feet!
Disgusting.

806
00:34:51.172 --> 00:34:52.256
DAVE: Oh!

807
00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:55.760
What?

808
00:34:55.843 --> 00:34:58.888
(upbeat rock music)

809
00:35:02.517 --> 00:35:04.393
Getting the big dick?

810
00:35:06.354 --> 00:35:09.440
That's the room. that's the
room penis. right there.

811
00:35:09.524 --> 00:35:12.860
No way.
That was the room penis.

812
00:35:12.944 --> 00:35:15.112
WOMAN: Hi. (laughing)

813
00:35:15.196 --> 00:35:17.198
Anything-
Let's get the boys

814
00:35:17.281 --> 00:35:18.115
changing now.

815
00:35:18.199 --> 00:35:19.367
Yeah. let's get the boys-

816
00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:22.203
Hi. I've got to put
on some dry clothes.

817
00:35:22.286 --> 00:35:25.540
WOMAN: Okay. Dave. we'll let
you have some privacy. Okay.

818
00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:31.462
PAT: Oh. it's like
kitchen is open.

819
00:35:31.546 --> 00:35:34.048
Peanut butter and
jelly sandwich.

820
00:35:39.887 --> 00:35:40.888
Can I have a bite?

821
00:35:42.723 --> 00:35:45.726
Rock over London.
rock on Chicago.

822
00:35:47.645 --> 00:35:49.146
Choosy mothers choose Jif.

823
00:35:50.606 --> 00:35:52.650
I like how the stools
are really small.

824
00:35:52.733 --> 00:35:55.403
I like that. that's great.

825
00:35:55.486 --> 00:35:56.988
Shooting the breeze
kind of this?

826
00:35:57.071 --> 00:35:58.239
Yeah.
Well. dude.

827
00:35:58.322 --> 00:35:59.156
You're social.

828
00:36:01.617 --> 00:36:02.493
What?

829
00:36:02.577 --> 00:36:05.580
Driving around the Midwest and-

830
00:36:05.663 --> 00:36:09.250
Actually Tanya Tucker's
tour bus From the 80s.

831
00:36:09.333 --> 00:36:10.918
We hustled into a van.

832
00:36:11.002 --> 00:36:12.837
I've never been in a
band where somebody

833
00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.256
loaded your gear for you
and set your shit up.

834
00:36:15.339 --> 00:36:17.758
But they had spray
painted their van silver.

835
00:36:17.842 --> 00:36:19.010
remember that?

836
00:36:19.093 --> 00:36:21.429
His car broke. he
had to borrow mine.

837
00:36:21.512 --> 00:36:22.680
But could you guys imagine

838
00:36:22.763 --> 00:36:25.266
if we would have started.

839
00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:28.519
done the first tour in a bus

840
00:36:28.603 --> 00:36:31.230
how different it
would have been?

841
00:36:31.314 --> 00:36:33.357
I think it goes back to
everything that you said

842
00:36:33.441 --> 00:36:37.778
that we had just become a
band and had we done that.

843
00:36:37.862 --> 00:36:39.780
we probably never would have
made it through the first year.

844
00:36:39.864 --> 00:36:41.866
To this day. we'll get
off the rental jet.

845
00:36:41.949 --> 00:36:45.119
the van with wings
and we all still cram

846
00:36:45.202 --> 00:36:47.163
in the same fucking
van so it's...

847
00:36:50.124 --> 00:36:50.958
Pat.

848
00:36:52.376 --> 00:36:54.211
Did you ever tour in a van
before the Foo Fighters?

849
00:36:54.295 --> 00:36:55.421
No.

850
00:36:55.504 --> 00:36:57.798
My first band tour
with you guys.

851
00:36:57.882 --> 00:36:58.966
So when you joined Nirvana.

852
00:36:59.050 --> 00:36:59.926
that was first time
you'd ever gone on tour?

853
00:37:00.009 --> 00:37:01.510
That was my first tour ever.

854
00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:06.807
Red delicious. you
got your ears on?

855
00:37:08.059 --> 00:37:10.895
That's a big 10-4. big buddy.

856
00:37:10.978 --> 00:37:13.648
Germs did a couple
our of town shows.

857
00:37:13.731 --> 00:37:16.150
which was like packing our shit

858
00:37:16.233 --> 00:37:19.487
in Chris Ashford's
two-door Buick Skylark.

859
00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:21.155
you know. drums and the amp.

860
00:37:21.239 --> 00:37:22.990
All we had was a
bass amp. a drum set.

861
00:37:23.074 --> 00:37:24.450
and a bass with no case.

862
00:37:24.533 --> 00:37:27.328
And all of us people
crammed in there

863
00:37:27.411 --> 00:37:29.622
and we'd drive to San Francisco
or San Diego or whatever.

864
00:37:29.705 --> 00:37:31.415
You didn't bring a guitar?

865
00:37:31.499 --> 00:37:33.292
I didn't have a guitar.
but then eventually...

866
00:37:33.376 --> 00:37:35.920
(laughing)

867
00:37:36.003 --> 00:37:37.421
Or an amp. so it made it easier

868
00:37:37.505 --> 00:37:40.091
to cram it all into
a Buick Skylark.

869
00:37:40.174 --> 00:37:41.259
♪ Give me. give me this ♪

870
00:37:41.342 --> 00:37:45.846
♪ Give me. give me that ♪

871
00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:48.599
♪ Give me it. now ♪

872
00:37:48.683 --> 00:37:51.310
♪ Give me it ♪

873
00:37:51.394 --> 00:37:53.854
None of us in the bands

874
00:37:53.938 --> 00:37:55.856
had even a thought of going
and doing it somewhere.

875
00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:59.443
And it wasn't till I
remember Black Flag

876
00:37:59.527 --> 00:38:02.029
started doing it more.
like you can do that?

877
00:38:02.113 --> 00:38:05.366
Like you can go around
the country and play
gigs everywhere?

878
00:38:05.449 --> 00:38:06.534
I just figured

879
00:38:06.617 --> 00:38:09.620
because every one of
my bands sucked so bad.

880
00:38:09.704 --> 00:38:12.373
why would I want to
take that anywhere else

881
00:38:12.456 --> 00:38:14.125
and make anyone else
have to listen to that?

882
00:38:14.208 --> 00:38:15.376
I had no idea that-

883
00:38:15.459 --> 00:38:17.044
That anyone would even
want to see it. right?

884
00:38:17.128 --> 00:38:18.963
Like why would we
go to another state?

885
00:38:19.046 --> 00:38:20.881
They don't know us.
they don't wanna see us.

886
00:38:20.965 --> 00:38:22.383
Yeah. and I just
didn't even know

887
00:38:22.466 --> 00:38:23.801
that the network existed.

888
00:38:23.884 --> 00:38:25.553
Do you wanna hear my take on

889
00:38:25.636 --> 00:38:28.514
the American punk
touring network

890
00:38:28.597 --> 00:38:30.975
and the vans that followed it?

891
00:38:31.058 --> 00:38:31.892
Okay.

892
00:38:31.976 --> 00:38:33.310
Band number one. D.O.A.

893
00:38:34.311 --> 00:38:37.398
(upbeat rock music)

894
00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:43.487
1979. D.O.A. from
Vancouver. Canada.

895
00:38:43.571 --> 00:38:44.739
they wanted to go play.

896
00:38:44.822 --> 00:38:47.199
Okay. so D.O.A. was
the first band to tour.

897
00:38:47.283 --> 00:38:50.036
First band that had a
band that had a band.

898
00:38:50.119 --> 00:38:51.162
IAN: They were connected

899
00:38:51.245 --> 00:38:53.164
to the Youth
International Party.

900
00:38:53.247 --> 00:38:56.917
They then knew that (indistinct)
so they booked a tour

901
00:38:57.001 --> 00:39:00.546
for D.O.A. that took them
around the country in 1979

902
00:39:00.629 --> 00:39:03.215
including here in
Washington at Madam's Organ.

903
00:39:03.299 --> 00:39:04.425
They did the circuit.

904
00:39:04.508 --> 00:39:06.510
They go through LA.
they meet Black Flag.

905
00:39:07.928 --> 00:39:09.013
And then they're like. "You
got to come to Vancouver."

906
00:39:09.096 --> 00:39:11.057
So Black Flag
makes their way up.

907
00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:14.351
They play San Francisco. maybe
Portland. Seattle. Vancouver.

908
00:39:14.435 --> 00:39:16.771
And they meet up
with the D.O.A. guys.

909
00:39:16.854 --> 00:39:19.106
And Bukowski sits down
with him and says.

910
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.441
"Can I get your numbers?"

911
00:39:20.524 --> 00:39:21.692
DURR: It was a sheet.

912
00:39:21.776 --> 00:39:24.028
And it had all the
clubs you could play.

913
00:39:24.111 --> 00:39:28.240
had the guy's number
who ran the club.

914
00:39:28.324 --> 00:39:30.201
It had like another number

915
00:39:30.284 --> 00:39:32.369
like a punk rock house
you could crash at.

916
00:39:33.454 --> 00:39:35.289
So then he starts booking a tour

917
00:39:35.373 --> 00:39:36.707
and he's exhaustively.

918
00:39:36.791 --> 00:39:38.209
they start booking and booking.

919
00:39:38.292 --> 00:39:41.420
And they're gonna do a trip
from LA to San Francisco.

920
00:39:41.504 --> 00:39:42.797
They're gonna stop
in San Luis Obispo.

921
00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:45.049
They're gonna just
fill in the blanks.

922
00:39:45.132 --> 00:39:47.051
They were going to for coverage.

923
00:39:47.134 --> 00:39:49.303
And Black Flag. their
first trip across.

924
00:39:49.386 --> 00:39:52.306
they just played so
many places nobody went.

925
00:39:52.389 --> 00:39:54.725
They did all the gig.
the dates they could find

926
00:39:54.809 --> 00:39:56.894
that were D.O.A.. but then
they started filling them in.

927
00:39:56.977 --> 00:39:57.895
Then they would get back to LA

928
00:39:57.978 --> 00:39:58.813
and they'd just turn around

929
00:39:58.896 --> 00:40:00.564
and go out and do their B tour.

930
00:40:00.648 --> 00:40:01.774
They just go round and round.

931
00:40:01.857 --> 00:40:04.485
but the whole time
they were developing

932
00:40:04.568 --> 00:40:06.070
like this network.

933
00:40:06.153 --> 00:40:08.239
D.O.A. came in
with the hatchets.

934
00:40:08.322 --> 00:40:10.658
And Black Flag came in
with like the steamer.

935
00:40:10.741 --> 00:40:13.327
(upbeat music)

936
00:40:14.829 --> 00:40:15.663
I don't wanna sound like I'm
blowing smoke up their ass.

937
00:40:15.746 --> 00:40:17.081
but them guys. man.

938
00:40:17.164 --> 00:40:19.750
I mean. a lot of what
I'm doing. I owe them.

939
00:40:19.834 --> 00:40:21.168
They had a different idea.

940
00:40:21.252 --> 00:40:24.130
The Flag guys were very
much a do it kind of thing.

941
00:40:24.213 --> 00:40:25.172
You would not believe
what college radio

942
00:40:25.256 --> 00:40:26.674
was like in them days.

943
00:40:26.757 --> 00:40:28.259
College radio was so terrible.

944
00:40:28.342 --> 00:40:30.427
but then they had a big switch

945
00:40:30.511 --> 00:40:33.013
and all of a sudden every
DJ had their own show

946
00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:34.265
and no playlist.

947
00:40:34.348 --> 00:40:36.183
But it wasn't like
that beginning. man.

948
00:40:36.267 --> 00:40:38.811
Punk wasn't really a
college thing for awhile.

949
00:40:38.894 --> 00:40:40.646
Touring the college circuit.

950
00:40:40.729 --> 00:40:43.023
a lot of that was through
the college radio circuit

951
00:40:43.107 --> 00:40:44.525
who were playing punk rock

952
00:40:44.608 --> 00:40:46.777
and so those where the
connections could be made

953
00:40:46.861 --> 00:40:47.862
so those were the towns.

954
00:40:47.945 --> 00:40:50.447
so they were developing
this network.

955
00:40:50.531 --> 00:40:52.867
The gig seemed like that was
the most control you had.

956
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:54.952
that situation.

957
00:40:55.035 --> 00:40:57.788
All the 23 hours it took
to get to there. wherever.

958
00:40:57.872 --> 00:40:59.832
for that one hour. the gig.

959
00:40:59.915 --> 00:41:02.168
So everything else is a
flyer. putting out records.

960
00:41:02.251 --> 00:41:04.378
having a band. you
know. put up a name.

961
00:41:04.461 --> 00:41:07.006
all this stuff is to
get people to the gig.

962
00:41:07.089 --> 00:41:08.174
Black Flag!

963
00:41:08.257 --> 00:41:11.635
(upbeat rock music)

964
00:41:11.719 --> 00:41:14.305
To be a punk rocker was
like doing everything

965
00:41:14.388 --> 00:41:16.891
you could to express yourself.

966
00:41:16.974 --> 00:41:19.977
(upbeat rock music)

967
00:41:22.646 --> 00:41:25.399
♪ Look at me. I look at you ♪

968
00:41:25.482 --> 00:41:27.234
♪ What the fuck you gonna do ♪

969
00:41:27.318 --> 00:41:30.738
When I first joined
Scream. I think I was 17

970
00:41:30.821 --> 00:41:33.324
or had just turned 18 years old.

971
00:41:33.407 --> 00:41:36.160
They were an established
band in Washington. DC.

972
00:41:36.243 --> 00:41:37.578
in Virginia. in America.

973
00:41:37.661 --> 00:41:41.749
They were kind of one
of those early American

974
00:41:41.832 --> 00:41:45.252
punk rock bands that traveled.

975
00:41:46.754 --> 00:41:50.674
I had looked at all these
pictures on album sleeves

976
00:41:52.343 --> 00:41:53.928
of punk rock bands

977
00:41:55.512 --> 00:41:57.264
with their sleeping bags
and all their equipment

978
00:41:57.348 --> 00:42:01.727
in a van and unloading
into a club out of the van.

979
00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:03.604
And that to me

980
00:42:04.688 --> 00:42:07.274
just seemed like a dream.

981
00:42:07.358 --> 00:42:11.862
Vans became sort of the
central mode for all the bands.

982
00:42:11.946 --> 00:42:12.863
You lived in your van.

983
00:42:12.947 --> 00:42:14.073
I wanted to be with people

984
00:42:14.156 --> 00:42:15.866
that wanted to
make music. record

985
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:19.119
and get in the van and
go experience the world.

986
00:42:19.203 --> 00:42:20.913
The physicality of
being in places.

987
00:42:20.996 --> 00:42:22.790
not just hearing about it.

988
00:42:22.873 --> 00:42:25.876
Your own first
person take on it.

989
00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.127
There's nothing like it.

990
00:42:27.211 --> 00:42:30.214
I think it's great for
the band in the van

991
00:42:30.297 --> 00:42:32.466
because you get to know
each other. you know.

992
00:42:32.549 --> 00:42:34.051
you're locked in.

993
00:42:34.134 --> 00:42:37.096
You know. I think that was
part of us coming together

994
00:42:37.179 --> 00:42:38.305
as the song says.

995
00:42:38.389 --> 00:42:40.474
You look at this van

996
00:42:40.557 --> 00:42:43.727
and it's like having a
newborn baby or something.

997
00:42:43.811 --> 00:42:48.440
like the amount of like
optimism. the possibilities.

998
00:42:48.524 --> 00:42:51.277
the infinite things that
we can get in this thing

999
00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:53.070
and we can go anywhere.

1000
00:42:53.153 --> 00:42:56.073
We can load all our
shit in here. our drums.

1001
00:42:56.156 --> 00:42:59.076
our amps. all our shit and go.

1002
00:43:00.869 --> 00:43:03.831
I have been able to live a life

1003
00:43:03.914 --> 00:43:06.500
where you could just play
music with your friends

1004
00:43:07.668 --> 00:43:09.795
in front of people and
travel around and do it.

1005
00:43:09.878 --> 00:43:11.922
It was like here's the
golden ticket to Oz.

1006
00:43:12.006 --> 00:43:14.341
Here's the fucking
golden brick pathway.

1007
00:43:14.425 --> 00:43:16.427
Your life is set.

1008
00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:17.845
Your winning.

1009
00:43:17.928 --> 00:43:20.931
(audience cheering)

1010
00:43:25.561 --> 00:43:28.605
(upbeat rock music)

1011
00:43:36.947 --> 00:43:38.365
DAVE: Well. I mean. at
this point in your life.

1012
00:43:38.449 --> 00:43:42.328
like were you just going out
to just go fucking have fun?

1013
00:43:42.411 --> 00:43:46.540
Were you aspiring to be
like a famous musician?

1014
00:43:46.623 --> 00:43:47.875
Were you just
throwing everything...

1015
00:43:47.958 --> 00:43:49.668
I was just being a punk.

1016
00:43:49.752 --> 00:43:52.046
It never occurred to me
to be famous or to be rich

1017
00:43:52.129 --> 00:43:53.297
or to think about it as a job.

1018
00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:55.215
It's sort of like this
would. we gotta go.

1019
00:43:55.299 --> 00:43:56.717
I just wanted to
meet the people.

1020
00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.010
I wanted to go. I wanted
to see what was out there.

1021
00:43:58.093 --> 00:44:00.804
You have to know like.
Rollins and I. in 1978

1022
00:44:00.888 --> 00:44:03.390
we took a Greyhound
Bus to California
just go skateboarding.

1023
00:44:03.474 --> 00:44:05.142
I was 16. he was 17.

1024
00:44:05.225 --> 00:44:07.728
So we were just like.
go. just go. go. go. go.

1025
00:44:07.811 --> 00:44:10.064
That was the mission. just go.

1026
00:44:10.147 --> 00:44:11.732
Jeff Nelson. drummer
of Minor Threat

1027
00:44:11.815 --> 00:44:16.403
and also very eccentric.
brilliant like builder.

1028
00:44:16.487 --> 00:44:21.158
He like got in the van.
came up with a design.

1029
00:44:21.241 --> 00:44:22.326
a deck design.

1030
00:44:22.409 --> 00:44:24.495
That was also a huge
part of all vans

1031
00:44:24.578 --> 00:44:27.873
is you've got to make
a really proper design.

1032
00:44:27.956 --> 00:44:30.000
DAVE: You know. every
band had that specific way

1033
00:44:30.084 --> 00:44:31.418
that they would pack
the back of the van.

1034
00:44:31.502 --> 00:44:34.088
You had one way to get the
fucking shit. it's like Tetris.

1035
00:44:34.171 --> 00:44:35.005
Yeah. yeah.
One way

1036
00:44:35.089 --> 00:44:35.839
to get the shit in there.

1037
00:44:35.923 --> 00:44:37.049
Like everything goes in-

1038
00:44:37.132 --> 00:44:38.425
Yeah. I was not that
guy who knew that.

1039
00:44:38.509 --> 00:44:41.095
(upbeat rock music)

1040
00:44:41.178 --> 00:44:42.262
Bands still do that?

1041
00:44:42.346 --> 00:44:43.972
Are they still doing that?
Yes.

1042
00:44:47.518 --> 00:44:49.269
So how long have
you had this one?

1043
00:44:49.353 --> 00:44:51.313
This is a rental.
Yeah.

1044
00:44:52.356 --> 00:44:53.607
This a rental?

1045
00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:54.942
You gonna return it like this?

1046
00:44:55.025 --> 00:44:56.110
Yep.
Yep. (laughing)

1047
00:44:56.193 --> 00:44:57.861
It's a necessity based thing

1048
00:44:57.945 --> 00:44:59.905
to manage the space of the van

1049
00:44:59.988 --> 00:45:02.950
'cause a big empty
hole isn't necessarily

1050
00:45:03.033 --> 00:45:04.785
the most efficient way to go.

1051
00:45:04.868 --> 00:45:07.663
Somehow you break up the space.

1052
00:45:09.289 --> 00:45:11.125
Some people will go horizontally

1053
00:45:11.208 --> 00:45:14.044
and have the equipment
in the back area.

1054
00:45:14.128 --> 00:45:15.546
It's a packed van.

1055
00:45:16.713 --> 00:45:17.548
With big fear all
the way at the top.

1056
00:45:17.631 --> 00:45:19.591
You can't see out the back.

1057
00:45:19.675 --> 00:45:20.884
It's not the safest.

1058
00:45:20.968 --> 00:45:22.636
DAVE: All right. show me
how you pack this thing.

1059
00:45:22.719 --> 00:45:24.054
Oh. yeah

1060
00:45:24.138 --> 00:45:25.806
Back in the day explain
how you would pack

1061
00:45:25.889 --> 00:45:27.307
and load your van.

1062
00:45:27.391 --> 00:45:30.269
First. man. (indistinct)

1063
00:45:30.352 --> 00:45:32.730
you unload all the
gear. man. right?

1064
00:45:32.813 --> 00:45:34.314
And then we take something

1065
00:45:34.398 --> 00:45:36.650
and we have to
throw the people out

1066
00:45:36.733 --> 00:45:38.610
and put a mattress there

1067
00:45:38.694 --> 00:45:40.737
so we can have place
to sleep. you see?

1068
00:45:40.821 --> 00:45:43.991
And then we move all
the gear in there.

1069
00:45:44.074 --> 00:45:47.536
And microwave built
and little how you say?

1070
00:45:49.204 --> 00:45:50.038
Loft.

1071
00:45:51.915 --> 00:45:55.836
Okay. Let's go for a 3000
mile trip around the country.

1072
00:45:55.919 --> 00:45:57.421
So how many miles are
you gonna put on this

1073
00:45:57.504 --> 00:45:58.589
before you bring it back?

1074
00:45:58.672 --> 00:46:00.257
Oh man. we're
gonna put probably.

1075
00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:05.012
probably put 6.000
on this. this trip.

1076
00:46:05.095 --> 00:46:06.597
Shit.

1077
00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:08.765
How many tours do you think
you've been on at this point?

1078
00:46:08.849 --> 00:46:10.768
Oh my God. I don't know.

1079
00:46:10.851 --> 00:46:12.936
50. 60. 70. more.

1080
00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:14.521
More. more probably.
I bet more.

1081
00:46:14.605 --> 00:46:15.689
Yeah.
How many tours

1082
00:46:15.772 --> 00:46:18.692
have you done in
America at this point?

1083
00:46:18.775 --> 00:46:19.776
US ones?

1084
00:46:21.445 --> 00:46:22.821
Probably more than
Europe. Right?

1085
00:46:22.905 --> 00:46:26.325
And I know if you call a
tour more than a month.

1086
00:46:26.408 --> 00:46:29.745
I just did 67 so maybe 35. 37?

1087
00:46:32.247 --> 00:46:34.041
DAVE: And this last tour?

1088
00:46:34.124 --> 00:46:37.836
This one was (indistinct)
tour. named after my pop.

1089
00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:39.963
it was 45 gigs. 45 days.

1090
00:46:40.047 --> 00:46:43.383
That's about 13.380 miles

1091
00:46:43.467 --> 00:46:44.968
and I drove every one of them.

1092
00:46:46.553 --> 00:46:50.474
I feel so grateful to
have had that experience.

1093
00:46:50.557 --> 00:46:52.559
to have like that have been.

1094
00:46:52.643 --> 00:46:54.478
like every step of the way of
the Chili Peppers. you know.

1095
00:46:54.561 --> 00:46:57.147
it's like we did every
little step. you know?

1096
00:46:57.231 --> 00:46:59.483
And first it was a van then
we moved up to the U-Hauls

1097
00:46:59.566 --> 00:47:00.901
then you could lay
down in the back

1098
00:47:00.984 --> 00:47:02.736
and you had like a little
mattress back there.

1099
00:47:02.819 --> 00:47:06.156
You know. you could sleep
with in Chad Smith's feet

1100
00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:07.157
in your fucking mouth.

1101
00:47:07.241 --> 00:47:08.408
You know what I mean?

1102
00:47:08.492 --> 00:47:11.245
But you'd get little
shut eye. you know?

1103
00:47:11.328 --> 00:47:13.372
And then. you know. then
we moved to the mobile home

1104
00:47:13.455 --> 00:47:16.333
and that was massive.
the Winnebago. you know.

1105
00:47:16.416 --> 00:47:19.253
And then the first shitty bus
with the crack head driver.

1106
00:47:19.336 --> 00:47:20.671
you know what I mean?

1107
00:47:20.754 --> 00:47:22.548
We were just driving
to pick up hitchhikers

1108
00:47:22.631 --> 00:47:23.674
and shit on a bus.

1109
00:47:23.757 --> 00:47:24.424
What?

1110
00:47:24.508 --> 00:47:25.717
When you go out there

1111
00:47:25.801 --> 00:47:26.927
and there's some like
weird methed out girls

1112
00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:28.512
in the front with the driver.

1113
00:47:28.595 --> 00:47:30.264
and you're like who is this?

1114
00:47:30.347 --> 00:47:33.517
We did the caravan of
cars. personal cars. right?

1115
00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.018
We got to experience
that part of the band.

1116
00:47:35.102 --> 00:47:38.438
Then we got to experience
the 15 passenger van

1117
00:47:38.522 --> 00:47:39.690
with a trailer.

1118
00:47:39.773 --> 00:47:41.525
Then we graduated
to 15 passenger van

1119
00:47:41.608 --> 00:47:42.859
with a cargo van.

1120
00:47:42.943 --> 00:47:46.405
Then we graduate to the
one bus. band and crew.

1121
00:47:46.488 --> 00:47:49.366
Then you graduate to two buses.

1122
00:47:49.449 --> 00:47:50.951
the band on one bus.
the crew on one.

1123
00:47:51.034 --> 00:47:53.870
And then you graduate
to everyone gets
their own bus. right?

1124
00:47:53.954 --> 00:47:56.373
So we kind of got to
experience all of that.

1125
00:47:56.456 --> 00:47:59.084
And it was all
bit by bit by bit.

1126
00:47:59.167 --> 00:48:00.919
So you appreciate it.

1127
00:48:01.003 --> 00:48:02.629
You appreciate the
fuck out of it.

1128
00:48:02.713 --> 00:48:05.215
That wow. I'm on my own bus.

1129
00:48:05.299 --> 00:48:06.633
You know?

1130
00:48:06.717 --> 00:48:08.302
And then when you can start
taking a crap on buses.

1131
00:48:08.385 --> 00:48:10.470
when that change happened.

1132
00:48:10.554 --> 00:48:11.888
that was massive.

1133
00:48:12.889 --> 00:48:14.766
The Shredder.
The Shredder.

1134
00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:15.642
DAVE: Dude. life changer.

1135
00:48:15.726 --> 00:48:17.269
It's a big deal.
I know.

1136
00:48:17.352 --> 00:48:18.729
That was a big deal.

1137
00:48:18.812 --> 00:48:20.230
Hey. remember this?

1138
00:48:20.314 --> 00:48:22.149
It's a 6140 Econoline.

1139
00:48:22.232 --> 00:48:23.650
the original modern day van.

1140
00:48:23.734 --> 00:48:26.653
And here's a new original.
the 7060 Econoline.

1141
00:48:26.737 --> 00:48:28.822
It's changing van history again.

1142
00:48:28.905 --> 00:48:30.073
Check it out.

1143
00:48:30.157 --> 00:48:32.242
It's the only van with
a strong. separate frame

1144
00:48:32.326 --> 00:48:34.328
and they moved the
engine forward 18 inches

1145
00:48:34.411 --> 00:48:36.997
for more freedom to move
around than in any other van.

1146
00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:38.999
And no matter how your
trick up your Ford.

1147
00:48:39.082 --> 00:48:41.585
there's lots of room
for bags and boats

1148
00:48:41.668 --> 00:48:43.420
and beauties.
Us?

1149
00:48:43.503 --> 00:48:45.672
No. these beauties.

1150
00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:49.926
I was taking my kids
to school one day.

1151
00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:54.348
My daughter Harper said.

1152
00:48:54.431 --> 00:48:56.850
"Dad. everybody's
looking at us."

1153
00:48:56.933 --> 00:48:58.518
And I said. "Yeah.

1154
00:48:58.602 --> 00:49:00.062
So why do you think that is?"

1155
00:49:01.521 --> 00:49:03.607
And she said. "Because all
new cars look the same."

1156
00:49:05.275 --> 00:49:07.277
I said. "Yeah. they kind of do."

1157
00:49:07.361 --> 00:49:12.199
She said. "They're all
gray or black or white.

1158
00:49:12.282 --> 00:49:13.950
There's no colorful cars anymore

1159
00:49:14.034 --> 00:49:16.036
and they're all kind
of the same shape."

1160
00:49:17.037 --> 00:49:18.622
And she was right.

1161
00:49:18.705 --> 00:49:21.083
But there was something
about the style

1162
00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:30.175
and the progression of
style that vans went through

1163
00:49:30.258 --> 00:49:33.387
from the 50 utility
vehicles to the 60s

1164
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:38.475
to the family vans. to the
70s. super 70 van culture.

1165
00:49:39.893 --> 00:49:42.729
They were such cool looking
machines and you know.

1166
00:49:42.813 --> 00:49:43.980
there's something about

1167
00:49:46.108 --> 00:49:50.445
that aesthetic where when
you're driving something

1168
00:49:51.571 --> 00:49:53.865
that has style.
it's like. you know.

1169
00:49:53.949 --> 00:49:55.742
it's like wearing a suit.

1170
00:49:58.578 --> 00:50:00.080
You can tell a
lot about a person

1171
00:50:00.163 --> 00:50:01.915
by what kind of van that drive.

1172
00:50:04.459 --> 00:50:05.836
Like this piece of shit.

1173
00:50:07.587 --> 00:50:11.258
AUDIENCE: Slayer!
Slayer! Slayer! Slayer!

1174
00:50:13.176 --> 00:50:14.052
DAVE: At what point did you guys

1175
00:50:14.136 --> 00:50:15.679
start to travel out of town?

1176
00:50:17.597 --> 00:50:19.850
We were traveling...

1177
00:50:19.933 --> 00:50:21.518
I would think it
was upon the release

1178
00:50:21.601 --> 00:50:25.272
of the first album is
when we started traveling.

1179
00:50:25.355 --> 00:50:27.023
One of the earliest trips

1180
00:50:27.107 --> 00:50:29.443
I believe we drove
our own vehicles

1181
00:50:29.526 --> 00:50:31.236
up to San Francisco.

1182
00:50:31.319 --> 00:50:33.238
We just did a couple of
shows. one at Ruthie's.

1183
00:50:33.321 --> 00:50:35.198
one at The Stone.

1184
00:50:36.032 --> 00:50:37.242
DAVE: Did you guys think

1185
00:50:37.325 --> 00:50:41.163
that you were going
to be a huge band?

1186
00:50:42.456 --> 00:50:44.374
No. but I knew there
was some special.

1187
00:50:44.458 --> 00:50:46.293
We were attracting fans.

1188
00:50:47.335 --> 00:50:48.879
People were interested.

1189
00:50:48.962 --> 00:50:53.049
And we were slowly beginning
to have a little following.

1190
00:50:53.133 --> 00:50:56.303
especially the clubs
playing in Orange County.

1191
00:50:56.386 --> 00:50:58.930
It was cool because
people were shocked

1192
00:50:59.014 --> 00:51:00.056
when they saw us.

1193
00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:03.143
(upbeat rock music)

1194
00:51:06.563 --> 00:51:09.900
(man screaming)

1195
00:51:09.983 --> 00:51:11.234
MAN: Slayer!

1196
00:51:11.318 --> 00:51:14.154
We were fearless.

1197
00:51:14.237 --> 00:51:18.158
You know. we were just
living life and enjoying it.

1198
00:51:18.241 --> 00:51:23.246
What it came down to was we
were like. we were Slayer.

1199
00:51:24.664 --> 00:51:27.000
We felt like we had this kind
of edge on everybody else.

1200
00:51:27.083 --> 00:51:29.002
on every other band there.

1201
00:51:29.085 --> 00:51:32.172
And it felt awesome.

1202
00:51:32.255 --> 00:51:35.258
(audience cheering)

1203
00:51:40.096 --> 00:51:43.183
(upbeat rock music)

1204
00:51:51.441 --> 00:51:53.193
What is it that makes someone

1205
00:51:53.276 --> 00:51:55.695
want to just jump in the van
with all of their friends

1206
00:51:55.779 --> 00:51:57.781
and disappear for
a couple months?

1207
00:51:57.864 --> 00:52:00.283
Yeah. I think it's
just about like fun.

1208
00:52:00.367 --> 00:52:04.830
Like you don't. it's also not
knowing what could happen.

1209
00:52:04.913 --> 00:52:06.832
Like it could either
be this amazing thing

1210
00:52:06.915 --> 00:52:08.125
or it's gonna be a
total train wreck.

1211
00:52:08.208 --> 00:52:09.709
but even with when
we've been on tour

1212
00:52:09.793 --> 00:52:12.379
and there's like train
wreck terrible moments

1213
00:52:12.462 --> 00:52:14.631
and terrible stories.
we laugh about it later.

1214
00:52:14.714 --> 00:52:17.801
(upbeat rock music)

1215
00:52:32.649 --> 00:52:35.986
God. the fucking days
of being like oh yeah.

1216
00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:41.074
somebody's out of town in
this like Philly row house.

1217
00:52:42.576 --> 00:52:44.202
and there's like a bed free

1218
00:52:44.286 --> 00:52:46.371
and you just find
yourself sleeping

1219
00:52:46.454 --> 00:52:50.083
in just some random gross
bed with like dirty sheets.

1220
00:52:50.166 --> 00:52:51.167
(laughing)

1221
00:52:51.251 --> 00:52:52.502
But it was great.

1222
00:52:52.586 --> 00:52:54.254
This was like. I'm
fucking living.

1223
00:52:54.337 --> 00:52:55.255
This is rad.

1224
00:52:55.338 --> 00:52:57.090
I'm in Philadelphia.

1225
00:52:57.173 --> 00:52:58.425
The third band in 92.

1226
00:52:58.508 --> 00:53:01.011
we went out and started
doing like the Midwest.

1227
00:53:01.094 --> 00:53:05.348
And I remember we played
in Oxford. Mississippi

1228
00:53:05.432 --> 00:53:08.768
and there was like
seven of us on stage

1229
00:53:10.687 --> 00:53:13.565
and no tickets sold to the show.

1230
00:53:13.648 --> 00:53:14.941
Zero. no one's gonna be there.

1231
00:53:15.025 --> 00:53:18.361
So Adrian met some
girls at the motel

1232
00:53:18.445 --> 00:53:20.322
and invited them
to show up on us.

1233
00:53:21.698 --> 00:53:23.116
So they came and so there
was like four of 'em.

1234
00:53:23.199 --> 00:53:26.202
So there's four people watching
the seven of us on stage.

1235
00:53:26.286 --> 00:53:30.415
There's more people on
stage than in the audience

1236
00:53:30.498 --> 00:53:31.750
and it was such a
small little bar

1237
00:53:31.833 --> 00:53:33.376
that like we would
literally take turns

1238
00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:34.920
going in the audience
to balance out

1239
00:53:35.003 --> 00:53:36.212
like how many
people were on stage

1240
00:53:36.296 --> 00:53:37.213
and how many people
were watching the band

1241
00:53:37.297 --> 00:53:39.466
or we watching ourselves.

1242
00:53:39.549 --> 00:53:41.217
Fucking awesome numbers.

1243
00:53:41.301 --> 00:53:44.137
(rain clattering)

1244
00:53:49.351 --> 00:53:51.061
Yeah! Yeah!
Oh. I got it!

1245
00:53:51.144 --> 00:53:52.270
DAVE: You never got
into an accident

1246
00:53:52.354 --> 00:53:53.146
or anything in
your van. did you?

1247
00:53:53.229 --> 00:53:54.481
I've almost died.

1248
00:53:54.564 --> 00:53:56.816
I never got into an
accident. but there was.

1249
00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:59.778
we were driving from. I
think somewhere in Ohio.

1250
00:53:59.861 --> 00:54:03.073
through West Virginia

1251
00:54:03.156 --> 00:54:04.950
and it was winter time.

1252
00:54:05.033 --> 00:54:06.910
We hit black ice
and I'm driving.

1253
00:54:06.993 --> 00:54:08.328
I'm listening to.

1254
00:54:08.411 --> 00:54:09.746
we're listening to Voivod.

1255
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:12.332
"War and Pain". never
forget. you know.

1256
00:54:12.415 --> 00:54:13.500
And all of a sudden.

1257
00:54:13.583 --> 00:54:15.669
Bam. it was hilarious. man.

1258
00:54:15.752 --> 00:54:18.338
I remember I hit my
head and I kind of.

1259
00:54:18.421 --> 00:54:21.007
it just went black
for a little bit.

1260
00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:23.468
And I opened my eyes. like
oh man. what's going on?

1261
00:54:23.551 --> 00:54:25.178
The car just starts spinning.

1262
00:54:25.261 --> 00:54:26.429
I'm like oh shit.

1263
00:54:26.513 --> 00:54:27.764
I lost control. There's
nothing I could do.

1264
00:54:27.847 --> 00:54:28.848
Music's off.

1265
00:54:28.932 --> 00:54:31.434
Everybody's sat up. you know.

1266
00:54:31.518 --> 00:54:33.979
truly white knuckling
the whole experience.

1267
00:54:34.062 --> 00:54:35.188
It was an hour.

1268
00:54:35.271 --> 00:54:36.439
I'm just driving along
and then suddenly

1269
00:54:36.523 --> 00:54:38.525
seeing a dead piglet on
the side of the road.

1270
00:54:38.608 --> 00:54:40.527
I'm like. "What the fuck?"

1271
00:54:40.610 --> 00:54:42.028
And then I can a couple.

1272
00:54:42.112 --> 00:54:44.781
maybe few seconds
later. another one.

1273
00:54:44.864 --> 00:54:46.032
I was like. "What happened?

1274
00:54:46.116 --> 00:54:47.867
Why are these little
dead piglets here?"

1275
00:54:47.951 --> 00:54:51.204
We're asleep on a mattress
in the back of the van.

1276
00:54:51.287 --> 00:54:53.206
We ended up driving straight

1277
00:54:53.289 --> 00:54:55.834
into an East German
military facility.

1278
00:54:55.917 --> 00:54:59.212
There was all these
truckers high on speed

1279
00:54:59.295 --> 00:55:01.548
and we said we needed
to get to Seattle.

1280
00:55:01.631 --> 00:55:06.636
And all the lads were out with
their machine guns and dogs

1281
00:55:08.138 --> 00:55:09.889
and looking for passports
from the driver and then-

1282
00:55:09.973 --> 00:55:12.475
There was this topless
girl in Detroit.

1283
00:55:12.559 --> 00:55:14.394
She took her leg off
and put a rose in it

1284
00:55:14.477 --> 00:55:15.895
and there's a picture of it.

1285
00:55:16.938 --> 00:55:17.814
You know what?

1286
00:55:17.897 --> 00:55:19.024
It's just how we live. Right?

1287
00:55:19.107 --> 00:55:21.484
And I realized at some
point they were sandbags

1288
00:55:21.568 --> 00:55:23.570
and I was tripping
my fucking brains out

1289
00:55:23.653 --> 00:55:25.238
because I was exhausted.

1290
00:55:25.321 --> 00:55:26.698
I hadn't slept.

1291
00:55:26.781 --> 00:55:28.992
For the whole time I kept
thinking these are dead piglets

1292
00:55:29.075 --> 00:55:31.995
every. who put a dead
piglet every 50 yards?

1293
00:55:32.078 --> 00:55:35.165
(laughing)

1294
00:55:35.248 --> 00:55:39.002
DAVE: What the fuck else in
the world would drive you

1295
00:55:39.085 --> 00:55:41.046
to such lengths to do anything?

1296
00:55:41.129 --> 00:55:43.673
Got to get to the gig. man.
Yeah.

1297
00:55:43.757 --> 00:55:47.177
Being in a van is
basic survival.

1298
00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:48.011
(laughing)

1299
00:55:48.094 --> 00:55:49.512
You know?

1300
00:55:49.596 --> 00:55:51.473
Like someone's gonna have
to learn to build a fire.

1301
00:55:52.849 --> 00:55:56.770
You get to be really.
really close with people.

1302
00:55:56.853 --> 00:56:00.356
like close in a way that
other fucking coworkers

1303
00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:03.276
at the bank couldn't
possibly know.

1304
00:56:03.359 --> 00:56:05.028
It's not that
glamorous to talk about

1305
00:56:05.111 --> 00:56:08.907
but it really takes like
a kind of immaturity

1306
00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:11.117
and innocence to be
on the road in a van

1307
00:56:11.201 --> 00:56:14.370
but also a type of maturity
where you can really tolerate.

1308
00:56:14.454 --> 00:56:17.791
see a bigger picture. have
patience. exercise kindness

1309
00:56:17.874 --> 00:56:20.877
to your fellows who
might be having issues

1310
00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:22.378
because when you're in a group

1311
00:56:22.462 --> 00:56:25.298
and you're in close quarters.
anything that's going on.

1312
00:56:25.381 --> 00:56:28.259
the group knows.
it's a group problem.

1313
00:56:28.343 --> 00:56:31.304
We've had band members who've
lost loved ones early on

1314
00:56:31.387 --> 00:56:32.555
and were in the van.

1315
00:56:32.639 --> 00:56:34.432
We've had people
with drug problems

1316
00:56:34.516 --> 00:56:36.059
getting clean in the van.

1317
00:56:36.142 --> 00:56:37.644
We've had people who were clean

1318
00:56:37.727 --> 00:56:39.562
having drug problems in the van.

1319
00:56:39.646 --> 00:56:41.981
It was really like I
have to deal with today.

1320
00:56:42.065 --> 00:56:44.984
And that's what the van
kind of meant for me.

1321
00:56:45.068 --> 00:56:47.237
You become each
other's support group

1322
00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:50.406
in so many different ways.

1323
00:56:50.490 --> 00:56:54.994
In some really crucial times
in your life. you know?

1324
00:56:55.078 --> 00:56:57.163
MAN: We got DH here.

1325
00:56:57.247 --> 00:56:58.164
I'm the bow legged brother

1326
00:56:58.248 --> 00:56:59.791
that you'll never be another.

1327
00:56:59.874 --> 00:57:01.417
And I still shoot soon.

1328
00:57:01.501 --> 00:57:02.669
(screaming)

1329
00:57:02.752 --> 00:57:04.754
DAVE: At what point did
you start getting high?

1330
00:57:04.838 --> 00:57:07.465
I think it started
with rock and roll.

1331
00:57:07.549 --> 00:57:09.008
(laughing)

1332
00:57:09.092 --> 00:57:10.343
15. I think I was 15.

1333
00:57:10.426 --> 00:57:13.721
I had a couple of beers
and I was like woo! Wow!

1334
00:57:15.098 --> 00:57:17.517
DAVE: And was there
alcoholism in the family?

1335
00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:20.854
It's weird because I never
met my biological father

1336
00:57:20.937 --> 00:57:23.648
but the father I grew up
with definitely an alcoholic.

1337
00:57:23.731 --> 00:57:26.276
Yeah. I mean. he would
drink and get drunk at night

1338
00:57:27.735 --> 00:57:31.447
and come into my room and
stick a shotgun in my face

1339
00:57:31.531 --> 00:57:33.366
and fucking ask
me if I was a man.

1340
00:57:33.449 --> 00:57:36.619
And that was a
typical Friday night.

1341
00:57:36.703 --> 00:57:38.121
"What the fuck. you
a man?" You know?

1342
00:57:38.204 --> 00:57:42.167
And he was just. he was
just. he was a drunk.

1343
00:57:42.250 --> 00:57:43.376
He was a periodic drunk

1344
00:57:43.459 --> 00:57:45.795
because he stayed drunk
for like the weekend.

1345
00:57:45.879 --> 00:57:48.798
and then he was a social
worker throughout the week.

1346
00:57:48.882 --> 00:57:51.926
(upbeat rock music)

1347
00:57:54.387 --> 00:57:57.348
DAVE: So you hit the road
with the Dead Kennedy's

1348
00:57:57.432 --> 00:57:58.725
but you hadn't really
traveled at that point?

1349
00:57:58.808 --> 00:58:00.018
I hadn't. no. I
hadn't been anywhere.

1350
00:58:00.101 --> 00:58:01.144
My first gig was in Sacramento

1351
00:58:01.227 --> 00:58:04.314
and we went across the US

1352
00:58:04.397 --> 00:58:07.692
and we hit the road and fucking
people just want to kill you

1353
00:58:07.775 --> 00:58:08.693
for the color of your skin.

1354
00:58:08.776 --> 00:58:11.362
It's insane. It was crazy.

1355
00:58:11.446 --> 00:58:13.656
Everybody's got a
right to free speech.

1356
00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:14.991
(audience cheering)

1357
00:58:15.074 --> 00:58:19.245
And this song is about
the fucking rednecks

1358
00:58:19.329 --> 00:58:21.247
and the fucking jocks

1359
00:58:21.331 --> 00:58:25.335
who bring in their bullshit
macho attitudes to these shows.

1360
00:58:26.502 --> 00:58:27.921
try to wreck 'em

1361
00:58:29.088 --> 00:58:32.175
by starting fights.

1362
00:58:32.258 --> 00:58:35.595
spreading around their
bullshit racist attitudes.

1363
00:58:35.678 --> 00:58:39.349
And that just fueled
my alcoholism.

1364
00:58:39.432 --> 00:58:40.934
I'm not gonna say that
that pushed me into it.

1365
00:58:41.017 --> 00:58:43.561
but it was quite a nudge

1366
00:58:43.645 --> 00:58:46.564
because then I didn't
talk as much to people

1367
00:58:46.648 --> 00:58:48.942
about like what's
going on internally

1368
00:58:49.025 --> 00:58:50.610
or I definitely didn't talk
to anybody in the band.

1369
00:58:50.693 --> 00:58:52.737
Like. "Hey man. you
know. I feel scared."

1370
00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:53.780
You know?

1371
00:58:53.863 --> 00:58:54.948
I didn't know you could do that.

1372
00:58:55.031 --> 00:58:58.534
Nazi Redneck assholes fuck off.

1373
00:58:58.618 --> 00:59:01.621

1378
00:59:09.879 --> 00:59:12.590
DAVE: Okay. So the Dead
Kennedy's are done.

1379
00:59:12.674 --> 00:59:13.800
Mm-hmm.

1380
00:59:13.883 --> 00:59:15.593
DAVE: And now where
does your life go?

1381
00:59:15.677 --> 00:59:19.430
I moved to Los
Angeles. California

1382
00:59:19.514 --> 00:59:22.308
and we got nothing going on.

1383
00:59:22.392 --> 00:59:25.812
So I'm drinking the morning.
drinking in the afternoon.

1384
00:59:25.895 --> 00:59:28.231
Then I joined the Chili Peppers.

1385
00:59:28.314 --> 00:59:32.485
And then that was like
trying to hide this facade.

1386
00:59:32.568 --> 00:59:36.489
this guy where I'm trying
to hide my addiction.

1387
00:59:36.572 --> 00:59:37.907
♪ In 1819. we took
a little trip ♪

1388
00:59:37.991 --> 00:59:39.742
♪ We went on down to
the mighty Mississippi ♪

1389
00:59:39.826 --> 00:59:42.161
♪ We got a little drunk
and we got a little wine ♪

1390
00:59:42.245 --> 00:59:44.330
♪ Next thing you know.

1391
00:59:44.414 --> 00:59:46.666

00:59:46.749 --> 00:59:49.794

1393

♪ Yeah ♪

1394
00:59:51.337 --> 00:59:53.506
So I just really leaned into it

1395
00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:56.092
and started fucking
shooting dope heavy.

1396
00:59:56.175 --> 00:59:57.844
Like then it was just
like nothing mattered.

1397
00:59:57.927 --> 01:00:01.681
And it started a
whirlwind of shit.

1398
01:00:01.764 --> 01:00:02.849
Now I'm selling shit.

1399
01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:04.309
Sold the van.

1400
01:00:04.392 --> 01:00:08.104
I had motorcycle. van.
classic guitars. muscle car.

1401
01:00:08.187 --> 01:00:10.106
I just sold everything.

1402
01:00:10.189 --> 01:00:13.276
I just didn't give
a shit anymore.

1403
01:00:13.359 --> 01:00:15.862
I started getting fucking
all these abscesses

1404
01:00:15.945 --> 01:00:17.613
and I went up in the hospital.

1405
01:00:17.697 --> 01:00:20.074
This is the first
one. it's about

1406
01:00:21.242 --> 01:00:23.536
it's on my hip. it's
about big as your.

1407
01:00:23.619 --> 01:00:25.038
yeah. like my fist.

1408
01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:27.707
You can see that and
you can see the whole.

1409
01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:29.792
like you can see your
whole hip socket.

1410
01:00:29.876 --> 01:00:33.129
The skin has started to fall
away and like getting rotted

1411
01:00:33.212 --> 01:00:35.798
and necrotic and just
shit was falling out.

1412
01:00:35.882 --> 01:00:39.719
Like I was really playing
in this band. bass. and

1413
01:00:40.928 --> 01:00:43.473
literally a piece of. a
chunk of meat just fell

1414
01:00:43.556 --> 01:00:46.476
down my leg and fell out of
my pants and on the floor.

1415
01:00:46.559 --> 01:00:48.478
They were like. "Dude. you
need to go to the hospital."

1416
01:00:48.561 --> 01:00:51.064
So. I kept bullshitting around.

1417
01:00:51.147 --> 01:00:53.191
I was like. "Yeah.
yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah."

1418
01:00:53.274 --> 01:00:55.401
And I would just wake up
in these pools of blood

1419
01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:59.989
with my pants soaked and
and just all fucked up.

1420
01:01:00.073 --> 01:01:01.324
Yeah. it ended.

1421
01:01:01.407 --> 01:01:03.242
Shit. the dope just took over.

1422
01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:05.828
And I would think about
that. I would go. yeah.

1423
01:01:05.912 --> 01:01:07.413
Wow. That was some times.

1424
01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:09.165
a lot of times
and a lot of years

1425
01:01:09.248 --> 01:01:11.542
where I didn't have
this food to eat.

1426
01:01:11.626 --> 01:01:14.712
like I literally wouldn't.
I just didn't eat

1427
01:01:14.796 --> 01:01:16.422
because I didn't have no
money. I didn't have food.

1428
01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:18.508
I spent all the money on dope

1429
01:01:18.591 --> 01:01:21.177
or I'd be in a homeless shelter

1430
01:01:23.304 --> 01:01:25.681
thinking that I'm a rock star.

1431
01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:27.016
I used to be a rockstar.

1432
01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:29.102
What the fuck has happened?

1433
01:01:29.185 --> 01:01:31.354
What the fuck has happened now?

1434
01:01:31.437 --> 01:01:33.731
Now I'm just a fucking
homeless piece of shit

1435
01:01:33.815 --> 01:01:36.692
with the rest of
these guys. you know?

1436
01:01:36.776 --> 01:01:39.529
So it was. ooh. it
was a mixed bag.

1437
01:01:46.285 --> 01:01:47.286
DAVE: How you doing?

1438
01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:49.288
(DH laughing)

1439
01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:50.581
Ugh!

1440
01:01:50.665 --> 01:01:52.125
I never been better
and I never had more.

1441
01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:55.002
It's not as much as
the struggle. because

1442
01:01:57.004 --> 01:01:58.923
I gave up the fight.

1443
01:01:59.006 --> 01:02:01.717
But to me. this is all winning.

1444
01:02:01.801 --> 01:02:04.262
And I do nothing but
really help people

1445
01:02:04.345 --> 01:02:07.473
more stay sober than not.

1446
01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:08.391
because it just helps me

1447
01:02:08.474 --> 01:02:09.767
because I see new people come in

1448
01:02:09.851 --> 01:02:13.729
and I know where they've been.

1449
01:02:13.813 --> 01:02:15.815
and I know how it feels.

1450
01:02:17.483 --> 01:02:22.488
and I know how it feels to
have somebody to reach out

1451
01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:25.158
and say. "Hey.
man. you all right?

1452
01:02:25.241 --> 01:02:26.492
Let's get a coffee."

1453
01:02:26.576 --> 01:02:27.910
Like nobody was
saying that shit.

1454
01:02:27.994 --> 01:02:29.996
Nobody was saying. "Hey.
let's go have coffee.

1455
01:02:30.079 --> 01:02:34.250
Let's go see a movie.
let's go hang out."

1456
01:02:35.668 --> 01:02:39.297
I discovered along with my
spirituality this whole sense

1457
01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:42.175
of love .

1458
01:02:42.258 --> 01:02:43.759
and self-love and

1459
01:02:45.678 --> 01:02:47.763
love for just fucking mankind.

1460
01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:51.809
I remember just getting sober

1461
01:02:51.893 --> 01:02:55.146
and everything looks so fresh.

1462
01:02:55.229 --> 01:02:56.689
So fresh and so new

1463
01:02:56.772 --> 01:02:59.901
and it's like hitting a
restart on your computer.

1464
01:03:04.197 --> 01:03:05.948
DAVE: Do you love yourself
a little more now?

1465
01:03:06.032 --> 01:03:06.866
A little more.

1466
01:03:07.867 --> 01:03:09.869
I love me a little more.

1467
01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:14.040
(laughing)

1468
01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:19.170

01:03:19.253 --> 01:03:23.966

1470
01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:28.304

1472
01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:34.477
What those close quarters do

1473
01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:35.853
for the comradery of the band.

1474
01:03:35.937 --> 01:03:37.563
It can do one of two things.

1475
01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:39.815
It can fucking make you
wanna kill each other

1476
01:03:39.899 --> 01:03:42.860
or it makes you. you
know. tight like a family.

1477
01:03:42.944 --> 01:03:44.362
Well. it's both.

1478
01:03:44.445 --> 01:03:45.988
Kind of like a family that
wants to kill each other

1479
01:03:46.072 --> 01:03:48.824
is pretty much okay.
so if you're in a van

1480
01:03:48.908 --> 01:03:50.326
and someone's annoying you.

1481
01:03:50.409 --> 01:03:54.413
you have to get over it
because you can't escape it.

1482
01:03:54.497 --> 01:03:57.166
It's like a marriage
of multiple people.

1483
01:03:57.250 --> 01:04:00.753
which in my experience
means it's really hard

1484
01:04:00.836 --> 01:04:03.089
to keep on the
same track forever.

1485
01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:05.925
I mean. you go through it
together and it's hard.

1486
01:04:06.008 --> 01:04:07.760
You go through a lot of shit

1487
01:04:07.843 --> 01:04:09.720
that you don't really
think about at the time.

1488
01:04:09.804 --> 01:04:13.891
but in hindsight. yeah.
you survived that together.

1489
01:04:13.975 --> 01:04:16.269
So it definitely
is a bonding thing

1490
01:04:17.645 --> 01:04:19.939
that you don't even
realize that's happening.

1491
01:04:20.022 --> 01:04:21.357
It was incredible.

1492
01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.859
It was an ultimate dream for me.

1493
01:04:23.943 --> 01:04:26.529
I had all that discomfort of
like getting some weird rash

1494
01:04:26.612 --> 01:04:29.073
because I'd been sweating
on a the stage going crazy

1495
01:04:29.156 --> 01:04:31.284
and then you don't
shower for six days

1496
01:04:31.367 --> 01:04:33.411
and then the van and
everyone's stinks

1497
01:04:33.494 --> 01:04:35.204
and you're fighting
and shitting your pants

1498
01:04:35.288 --> 01:04:37.915
and eating the worst food
you could ever imagine.

1499
01:04:37.999 --> 01:04:40.626
It's heaven. it's
fucking paradise.

1500
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:42.878
it's the greatest thing
you could ever do.

1501
01:04:42.962 --> 01:04:44.755
I just felt like we
were just like a roaming

1502
01:04:44.839 --> 01:04:46.090
band of gypsies.

1503
01:04:46.173 --> 01:04:47.800
We show up and we rock you.

1504
01:04:47.883 --> 01:04:50.136
♪ Rock you ♪

1505
01:04:51.178 --> 01:04:52.054
You know. we get
out of the world

1506
01:04:52.138 --> 01:04:53.431
and we play "Get Up and Jump"

1507
01:04:53.514 --> 01:04:54.890
and "True Men
Don't Kill Coyotes"

1508
01:04:54.974 --> 01:04:57.727
and we fucking we do it with
every fiber of our being

1509
01:04:57.810 --> 01:05:02.064
as hard as we can every night
and it means everything.

1510
01:05:02.148 --> 01:05:03.441
You know what was crazy?

1511
01:05:03.524 --> 01:05:05.735
We always drove home.

1512
01:05:05.818 --> 01:05:08.738
We never stayed in a
motel or in a tent.

1513
01:05:08.821 --> 01:05:10.948
We drove home and then we
got in the van the next day

1514
01:05:11.032 --> 01:05:12.742
and went to the next gig.

1515
01:05:12.825 --> 01:05:14.327
We were driving from London.

1516
01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:16.912
It's like the coldest
day ever in Britain.

1517
01:05:16.996 --> 01:05:20.750
coldest night in Britain.
freezing cold. snowing.

1518
01:05:20.833 --> 01:05:22.251
Just the worst.

1519
01:05:22.335 --> 01:05:27.340
And the windshield went
and it had the bench seat.

1520
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:31.093
And so we laid on top of
each other. The Beatles.

1521
01:05:31.177 --> 01:05:35.097
And if you got to the top.
you had a slug of whiskey

1522
01:05:35.181 --> 01:05:37.350
and then you moved
your way down again

1523
01:05:37.433 --> 01:05:39.018
and the next one had a slug

1524
01:05:39.101 --> 01:05:42.521
and that's how we got back
home without freezing to death.

1525
01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:45.775
And you think. ah. you
know. that's how it is.

1526
01:05:51.238 --> 01:05:54.450
(man speaking indistinctly)

1527
01:05:54.533 --> 01:05:55.868
DAVE: What was it
like to be stuck

1528
01:05:55.951 --> 01:05:57.620
in a fucking little van

1529
01:05:57.703 --> 01:06:01.624
with the same four or five
dudes for two and half months?

1530
01:06:01.707 --> 01:06:03.793
(laughing)

1531
01:06:03.876 --> 01:06:06.045
Well. I mean. you know.
it's like a little tribe

1532
01:06:06.128 --> 01:06:08.714
of nomads running around.

1533
01:06:10.132 --> 01:06:13.010
I think it's one of the
funnest things you can do.

1534
01:06:13.094 --> 01:06:16.055
Being in a gang. in a
band. in a collective.

1535
01:06:16.138 --> 01:06:18.849
in a commune. in a group.
whatever fucking word

1536
01:06:18.933 --> 01:06:20.393
you want to attach to it.

1537
01:06:20.476 --> 01:06:22.853
just being with other people
and sharing that experience

1538
01:06:22.937 --> 01:06:26.482
with other people. that
was paramount to anything.

1539
01:06:26.565 --> 01:06:29.110
Ill never forget there
was a guy in the band who.

1540
01:06:30.486 --> 01:06:32.947
I don't know if he had
food poisoning or something

1541
01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:39.495
but he was farting
the most like noxious.

1542
01:06:40.621 --> 01:06:43.416
like make you want
to puke farts.

1543
01:06:44.291 --> 01:06:45.710
And that's just how you live.

1544
01:06:45.793 --> 01:06:48.462
This is just like. I guess
this is my new reality is I.

1545
01:06:51.006 --> 01:06:54.510
I sit in a fart van. (laughing)

1546
01:06:54.593 --> 01:06:56.679
And get to Baltimore and
play for the bar staff.

1547
01:06:56.762 --> 01:06:58.681
Like it was awesome. (laughing)

1548
01:06:58.764 --> 01:07:00.683
DAVE: Did you know
that the Beatles fart?

1549
01:07:00.766 --> 01:07:01.517
No.

1550
01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:03.853
If you fart. admit it.

1551
01:07:03.936 --> 01:07:06.188
(laughing)

1552
01:07:07.356 --> 01:07:10.109
in the van. because it
causes so much trouble.

1553
01:07:10.192 --> 01:07:13.237
You know. eating curry
and then the flatulence

1554
01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:14.572
which followed in the van.

1555
01:07:14.655 --> 01:07:17.700
the fucking pong. get the fuck.

1556
01:07:17.783 --> 01:07:20.035
We had to put the
windscreen wipers on.

1557
01:07:20.119 --> 01:07:21.537
sometimes they were that bad.

1558
01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:24.915
And you know when you get
fallen over laughter fit

1559
01:07:24.999 --> 01:07:27.209
where you're on the
floor just giggling?

1560
01:07:27.293 --> 01:07:28.127
They're so rare.

1561
01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:29.462
And they're sort of special.

1562
01:07:29.545 --> 01:07:31.464
a lot of people it's
never happened to.

1563
01:07:31.547 --> 01:07:32.798
it's never happen to them.

1564
01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:34.300

When you get that full
done laughing feeling

1571
01:07:51.525 --> 01:07:52.651
and everybody's in.

1572
01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:55.905
you can't even start
a word before the.

1573
01:07:55.988 --> 01:07:58.407
you know. everybody's
back down again.

1574
01:07:58.491 --> 01:07:59.658
Fucking magic.

1575
01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:02.161
Oh my God. Anthony.

1576
01:08:02.244 --> 01:08:04.288
Oh my God.

1577
01:08:04.371 --> 01:08:05.831
Take the fucking picture.

1578
01:08:07.249 --> 01:08:08.501
Oh!

1579
01:08:08.584 --> 01:08:09.418
When you're in a band.

1580
01:08:09.502 --> 01:08:10.795
especially like you're in a van.

1581
01:08:10.878 --> 01:08:12.755
like you know. everyone's
pissing you off.

1582
01:08:12.838 --> 01:08:15.257
but you really fall in
love with everyone too.

1583
01:08:15.341 --> 01:08:16.759
You know?

1584
01:08:16.842 --> 01:08:19.261
And you show up and it's
just that feeling of like.

1585
01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:21.931
you know. we're gonna
fucking explode.

1586
01:08:22.014 --> 01:08:23.140
Like we're gonna up there
and I'm gonna go up there

1587
01:08:23.224 --> 01:08:25.267
and I'm gonna explode. you know?

1588
01:08:25.351 --> 01:08:28.270
'Cause I know this
like tense boiled.

1589
01:08:28.354 --> 01:08:32.441
this ball. tightly coiled
up inside of me all my life.

1590
01:08:32.525 --> 01:08:35.528
And it was like all of
a sudden I found a way

1591
01:08:35.611 --> 01:08:38.531
where. you know. 'cause I
had felt in so many ways

1592
01:08:38.614 --> 01:08:39.782
growing up like lesser than

1593
01:08:39.865 --> 01:08:42.451
and I was always small
and little and skinny

1594
01:08:42.535 --> 01:08:45.287
and I was scared of
girls and I was weird

1595
01:08:45.371 --> 01:08:47.456
and like a jazz nerd and
you know what I mean?

1596
01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:49.458
Like but I found this
thing and it was a place

1597
01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:51.627
where not only like all
this like tension inside me.

1598
01:08:51.710 --> 01:08:53.379
that I could release it.

1599
01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:56.549
but also that I was
discovering myself.

1600
01:08:56.632 --> 01:08:58.384
I was discovering my identity.

1601
01:08:58.467 --> 01:09:02.638
And I realize it not
only was like selfish.

1602
01:09:02.721 --> 01:09:04.974
like I'm able to
release all this stuff.

1603
01:09:05.057 --> 01:09:06.642
but I was looking at people

1604
01:09:06.725 --> 01:09:09.228
who are right there in front
of me and they were happy.

1605
01:09:09.311 --> 01:09:11.063
When we were doing
those van tours.

1606
01:09:11.146 --> 01:09:13.148
it was us against the world.

1607
01:09:13.232 --> 01:09:15.401
So we would hit the
stage in between

1608
01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:18.237
those fucking long drives.

1609
01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:20.531
And even if we're playing
for 10 people or 15 people

1610
01:09:20.614 --> 01:09:22.032
or 30 people.

1611
01:09:22.116 --> 01:09:25.494
you just hit the stage and
it's like this is what I do.

1612
01:09:25.578 --> 01:09:27.496
This is what we do together.

1613
01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:28.914
You're waiting
for those moments.

1614
01:09:28.998 --> 01:09:30.666
I always say like life is
just waiting for those moments

1615
01:09:30.749 --> 01:09:32.001
to get back on stage.

1616
01:09:32.084 --> 01:09:34.211
Everything else is kind
of passing the time.

1617
01:09:34.295 --> 01:09:36.171
(audience cheering)

1618
01:09:36.255 --> 01:09:38.799
(bell dinging)

1619
01:09:43.762 --> 01:09:46.473
DAVE: And you get on stage now

1620
01:09:47.933 --> 01:09:49.894
do you still get the
same feeling you had

1621
01:09:49.977 --> 01:09:51.437
the first time that
you got on stage?

1622
01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.188
Yeah. absolutely.

1623
01:09:53.272 --> 01:09:55.357
You can't be in a rock
and roll band and say.

1624
01:09:55.441 --> 01:09:57.693
"Well. I've got three
gigs this weekend.

1625
01:09:59.111 --> 01:10:02.031
I'll take it easy tonight
and save me energy."

1626
01:10:02.114 --> 01:10:04.199
You can't. it's impossible.

1627
01:10:04.283 --> 01:10:07.286
You have to go till
your throat's dead.

1628
01:10:07.369 --> 01:10:08.203
You know?

1629
01:10:08.287 --> 01:10:11.206
And even then. make an attempt.

1630
01:10:11.290 --> 01:10:12.708
And the crowd love you
all the more for it

1631
01:10:12.791 --> 01:10:15.294
'cause you're not giving
up or wimping out.

1632
01:10:15.377 --> 01:10:19.924
You go on with it otherwise
it's not rock and roll anymore.

1633
01:10:20.007 --> 01:10:24.970
It's somebody attempting
to be rock and roll.

1634
01:10:26.221 --> 01:10:27.765
Growing up. like going
to see a band live

1635
01:10:27.848 --> 01:10:29.642
was the way you
connected with them.

1636
01:10:29.725 --> 01:10:31.894
Now you can connect with them
in so many different ways

1637
01:10:31.977 --> 01:10:33.979
and everyone's connecting
with so many different things.

1638
01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:37.650
It's all just like. there's
so much stuff going on.

1639
01:10:37.733 --> 01:10:41.779
I just think it's just.
it's changed so much.

1640
01:10:41.862 --> 01:10:43.405
So now there's a lot
of live streaming

1641
01:10:43.489 --> 01:10:45.491
and you can watch
concerts at home.

1642
01:10:45.574 --> 01:10:48.160
You don't have to go
to a fucking concert.

1643
01:10:48.243 --> 01:10:52.456
I not only accept the
technology and where it's gone.

1644
01:10:52.539 --> 01:10:54.333
but I actually love it.

1645
01:10:54.416 --> 01:10:57.378
(upbeat rock music)

1646
01:11:09.181 --> 01:11:11.934
It's a completely different
playing field now.

1647
01:11:12.017 --> 01:11:14.353
There's so many different
ways of trying to see

1648
01:11:14.436 --> 01:11:17.773
if this new sort of.

1649
01:11:17.856 --> 01:11:19.525
with the way the
technology's working out

1650
01:11:19.608 --> 01:11:22.361
to get it to hit an
audience. to make it work.

1651
01:11:22.444 --> 01:11:23.278
You know?

1652
01:11:26.532 --> 01:11:28.784
It like started with like
you listen to one thing

1653
01:11:28.867 --> 01:11:30.619
from your parents and
then there's YouTube.

1654
01:11:30.703 --> 01:11:32.705
which is like you go down

1655
01:11:32.788 --> 01:11:37.126
and you can see every concert
from like 1977 or whatever.

1656
01:11:37.209 --> 01:11:38.711
And then it branches off

1657
01:11:38.794 --> 01:11:39.962
and you find out-

1658
01:11:40.045 --> 01:11:41.880
Other bands.
Other bands yourself.

1659
01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:44.133
But it just makes
you want to be there.

Maybe if it's on an
individual basis.

1672
01:12:18.333 --> 01:12:20.252
just a couple of people.

1673
01:12:20.335 --> 01:12:23.213
but it will actually
change somebody

1674
01:12:23.297 --> 01:12:24.923
and it did in my case.

1675
01:12:25.007 --> 01:12:27.760
(audience cheering)

1676
01:12:27.843 --> 01:12:29.011
Ladies and gentlemen!

1677
01:12:30.929 --> 01:12:34.850
A warm welcome please
from Dublin. Ireland. U2!

1678
01:12:36.143 --> 01:12:39.271
(audience cheering)

1679
01:12:40.689 --> 01:12:43.942
THE EDGE: This connection
with the live audience-

1680
01:12:44.026 --> 01:12:45.069
Good evening!

1681
01:12:45.152 --> 01:12:47.529
Really taught us
everything we just know

1682
01:12:47.613 --> 01:12:49.281
about being in a band.

1683
01:12:49.364 --> 01:12:52.284
Without the experience
of growing up

1684
01:12:52.367 --> 01:12:55.621
playing small little clubs
and learning how to do it.

1685
01:12:55.704 --> 01:12:57.790
I don't think our
band would've made it.

1686
01:12:57.873 --> 01:13:00.084
I don't think it would be
anything like it is now.

1687
01:13:00.167 --> 01:13:03.170
(upbeat rock music)

1688
01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:07.466
You can't put it in
words what the energy.

1689
01:13:07.549 --> 01:13:10.135
it's a whole different thing
that you can't describe

1690
01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:12.137
when you're actually
watching a band that you love

1691
01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:14.473
in the room versus
watching in on screen.

1692
01:13:14.556 --> 01:13:17.476
It's just a different
experience as we know.

1693
01:13:17.559 --> 01:13:18.811
What happens in your ears.

1694
01:13:18.894 --> 01:13:20.479
what happens through your eyes.

1695
01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:22.648
what happens to your body

1696
01:13:22.731 --> 01:13:24.399
in that energy in
the room. right?

1697
01:13:24.483 --> 01:13:28.070
It's just. it's a completely
different experience

1698
01:13:28.153 --> 01:13:32.491
that I'm so grateful that I
got to see all these bands

1699
01:13:32.574 --> 01:13:33.742
for so many years.

1700
01:13:33.826 --> 01:13:35.327
All these bands
that I love so much.

1701
01:13:35.411 --> 01:13:38.455
You say. one. two. three. Do it!

1702
01:13:38.539 --> 01:13:41.583
AUDIENCE: One. two. three!

1703
01:13:41.667 --> 01:13:44.962
(upbeat rock music)

1704
01:13:45.045 --> 01:13:47.256
To have people. to
see people singing

1705
01:13:47.339 --> 01:13:48.757
songs that we
wrote in the studio

1706
01:13:48.841 --> 01:13:51.677
and because we were in a good
mood and having a good time.

1707
01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.303
that's so great.

1708
01:13:53.387 --> 01:13:55.848
I think that's the
(indistinct) for me.

1709
01:13:55.931 --> 01:13:58.433
♪ Yeah ♪

1710
01:13:58.517 --> 01:14:01.520
(audience singing)

1711
01:14:10.863 --> 01:14:12.281
Who've I've become
by not growing up

1712
01:14:12.364 --> 01:14:16.201
is much bigger than anyone's
ever become growing up.

1713
01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:18.036
Do you ever think that sometimes

1714
01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:19.538
when you're playing on stage.

1715
01:14:19.621 --> 01:14:22.040
I can't believe I'm getting
paid for this right now?

1716
01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:23.375
Every-
Like this is-

1717
01:14:23.458 --> 01:14:24.543
Everyday.

1718
01:14:24.626 --> 01:14:27.546
(audience singing)

1719
01:14:39.766 --> 01:14:40.601
Okay.

1720
01:14:41.476 --> 01:14:43.896
(upbeat rock music)

1721
01:14:43.979 --> 01:14:44.813
Guess what?

1722
01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:52.738
This is exactly what I fucking
hoped would happen right now.

1723
01:14:52.821 --> 01:14:55.199
(audience cheering)

1724
01:14:55.282 --> 01:14:57.701
Dan. light 'em up.
I got to see 'em.

01:14:57.784 --> 01:14:59.745
Hey. Glastonbury!

1726
01:14:59.828 --> 01:15:00.662
Hey!

1727
01:15:03.916 --> 01:15:05.709
Thank you so much. you guys.

1728
01:15:05.792 --> 01:15:07.085
it's a been a beautiful evening.

1729
01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:09.046
(audience cheering)

1730
01:15:09.129 --> 01:15:11.006
I remember the great
shows that I've been to.

1731
01:15:11.089 --> 01:15:12.841
They changed my life. you know?

1732
01:15:12.925 --> 01:15:14.676
The Clash changed my life.

1733
01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:16.094

1737
01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:26.772
You see a lot of acts
that are just taking

1738
01:15:26.855 --> 01:15:27.940
what they did in the studio

1739
01:15:28.023 --> 01:15:29.399
and leading that to a stage

1740
01:15:29.483 --> 01:15:32.277
and expecting that that's
going to work and it doesn't.

1741
01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:36.365
So there's something about the
live concerts that. you know.

1742
01:15:36.448 --> 01:15:40.536
the honesty of it
that you can't hide.

1743
01:15:40.619 --> 01:15:44.456
That is the reason I think
that people go to shows.

They don't go to shows

1748
01:15:51.505 --> 01:15:53.799
to hear the music they
hear on the radio.

1749
01:15:53.882 --> 01:15:56.385
They want to see
something different

1750
01:15:56.468 --> 01:16:00.722
and something compelling.
something that is
going to connect

1751
01:16:00.806 --> 01:16:01.974
with them in a deep way.

1752
01:16:02.057 --> 01:16:04.393
And I think the
best acts do that.

1753
01:16:04.476 --> 01:16:07.145
but they're the ones that
have paid their dues.

1754
01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:08.230
(upbeat rock music)

1755
01:16:08.313 --> 01:16:10.399

soul that helps me

1766
01:16:43.015 --> 01:16:48.020
It's 2019 and the biggest
rock bands in the world.

1767
01:16:49.187 --> 01:16:51.440
all the same biggest
rock bands in the world

1768
01:16:51.523 --> 01:16:56.528
that were. you know.
1999 or 1989. you know.

1769
01:16:57.237 --> 01:16:58.697
Guns and Roses and AC/DC

1770
01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:03.368
and Iron Maiden and Aerosmith
and you guys and us and so on.

1771
01:17:04.536 --> 01:17:06.288
I mean. that's the
fucking crazy thing.

1772
01:17:06.371 --> 01:17:10.417
And so I think there's a whole
bunch of conversations about

1773
01:17:11.626 --> 01:17:15.380
why has that not changed?

1774
01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:16.673
It's funny because Thom Yorke

1775
01:17:16.757 --> 01:17:18.675
brought that point
up to me as well.

1776
01:17:18.759 --> 01:17:19.634
DAVE: What is that?

1777
01:17:19.718 --> 01:17:20.844
Well. he just said it was like.

1778
01:17:20.927 --> 01:17:22.346
'cause there's so few of us left

1779
01:17:22.429 --> 01:17:25.140
that can go play big places
all over the world. right?

1780
01:17:25.223 --> 01:17:28.060
We can go fill up arenas.
stadiums. all over the fucking.

1781
01:17:28.143 --> 01:17:29.811
At a certain point.
like in the 90s

1782
01:17:29.895 --> 01:17:33.690
or late 90s or something. it's
like they put up a big fence

1783
01:17:33.774 --> 01:17:35.901
or they drew a line
or made a big wall

1784
01:17:35.984 --> 01:17:37.694
and all of us that were
on one side of the wall

1785
01:17:37.778 --> 01:17:39.821
got to do it for the
rest of our lives.

1786
01:17:39.905 --> 01:17:41.907
and no one else can come in.

1787
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:44.826
And has anyone else come
in. in 20 years? Rock band?

1788
01:17:46.453 --> 01:17:47.829
Is there one?

1789
01:17:47.913 --> 01:17:51.708
I mean. I might be missing
it. but. no. right?

1790
01:17:51.792 --> 01:17:53.502
Why do you do this to yourself?

1791
01:17:53.585 --> 01:17:55.170
Why do you punish
yourself that much?

1792
01:17:55.253 --> 01:17:56.088
Punish myself?
Yeah.

1793
01:17:56.171 --> 01:17:57.506
You're talking about punishment.

1794
01:17:57.589 --> 01:17:58.673
Yeah.

1795
01:17:58.757 --> 01:18:00.509
I don't see the punishment.

1796
01:18:00.592 --> 01:18:03.345
Well. the enormous
volume of music.

1797
01:18:03.428 --> 01:18:05.889
the enormous amount of
energy that you take

1798
01:18:05.972 --> 01:18:07.099
and that you give.

1799
01:18:07.182 --> 01:18:08.892
That's not punishment.
That's pleasure.

1800
01:18:08.975 --> 01:18:10.102
Is it pleasure?
Yeah.

1801
01:18:10.185 --> 01:18:12.020
We're a band based on
the pleasure principle.

1802
01:18:12.104 --> 01:18:13.230
And when I go out there

1803
01:18:13.313 --> 01:18:14.689
and when I go out there
with my best friends

1804
01:18:14.773 --> 01:18:16.692
and we make beautiful
music that is sacred to us.

1805
01:18:16.775 --> 01:18:20.779
that's nothing but
ultimate glorious euphoria.

1806
01:18:20.862 --> 01:18:22.948
There is no pain
when you're on stage.

1807
01:18:23.031 --> 01:18:24.783
the pain comes during life

1808
01:18:24.866 --> 01:18:26.284
and that's a place to
fucking exorcize the pain

1809
01:18:26.368 --> 01:18:27.911
out of your body.

1810
01:18:27.994 --> 01:18:29.454
You have to want it.

1811
01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:30.956
You really have to want it

1812
01:18:31.039 --> 01:18:33.625
and you've just got to go
through the tough times

1813
01:18:33.708 --> 01:18:35.085
because it will be tough.

1814
01:18:35.168 --> 01:18:36.628
You're not gonna get an
easy ride. That's for sure.

1815
01:18:36.711 --> 01:18:40.382
It's hard and it's arduous
and it's fun as fuck.

1816
01:18:40.465 --> 01:18:42.717
When you're at a certain age

1817
01:18:42.801 --> 01:18:46.263
and you find something
beautiful that you love.

1818
01:18:46.346 --> 01:18:48.140
go for it with
everything you've got.

1819
01:18:48.223 --> 01:18:50.392
because it will serve
you your entire life.

1820
01:18:50.475 --> 01:18:53.895
Do you ever feel like
giving up and going home?

1821
01:18:53.979 --> 01:18:54.813
Never.

1822
01:18:56.064 --> 01:18:58.233
Never. never give up.

1823
01:18:58.316 --> 01:19:00.026
DAVE: Do you ever want to quit?

1824
01:19:01.528 --> 01:19:02.654
No.

1825
01:19:02.737 --> 01:19:04.072
That's crazy. No.

1826
01:19:04.156 --> 01:19:05.740
DAVE: Do you ever
feel like giving up?

1827
01:19:05.824 --> 01:19:07.075
No.

1828
01:19:07.159 --> 01:19:07.993
No.

1829
01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:11.997
The guys I was in the
van with 20 years ago

1830
01:19:13.373 --> 01:19:14.750
are still my band.

1831
01:19:16.418 --> 01:19:18.128
And I don't know
if they would be

1832
01:19:18.211 --> 01:19:21.256
if we didn't have that
experience together.

1833
01:19:21.339 --> 01:19:22.632
There's no greater gift

1834
01:19:22.716 --> 01:19:25.260
than to have your little crew

1835
01:19:26.386 --> 01:19:28.680
and you're in your
boat. working the town.

1836
01:19:30.015 --> 01:19:32.768
I really love it.
I really love it.

1837
01:19:33.935 --> 01:19:35.270
Our records have never
gone out of print.

1838
01:19:35.353 --> 01:19:38.231
We're still this real
band. still touring.

1839
01:19:39.524 --> 01:19:41.610
Still playing to young
people or old people

1840
01:19:41.693 --> 01:19:43.111
and all kinds of people.

1841
01:19:43.195 --> 01:19:46.448
It's amazing. It's like a
wow thing every night to me.

1842
01:19:46.531 --> 01:19:49.075
And we still tour in a van.

1843
01:19:50.035 --> 01:19:52.287
We have two vans now.

1844
01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:54.789
What is it that keeps you going?

1845
01:19:54.873 --> 01:19:57.292
Jazz musicians would just
fucking die on stage.

1846
01:19:59.127 --> 01:20:01.796
There doesn't have to
be an end to touring.

1847
01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:03.798
There doesn't have to
be an end to playing.

1848
01:20:03.882 --> 01:20:05.926
At the end of the day.

1849
01:20:07.052 --> 01:20:09.721
playing music. and
fucking writing songs

1850
01:20:10.764 --> 01:20:12.474
is what I love to do.

1851
01:20:12.557 --> 01:20:14.142
It's my favorite thing to do.

1852
01:20:14.226 --> 01:20:17.187
Like for me. the
answer is. it's simple.

1853
01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:20.190
and it's love and
that's the only answer.

1854
01:20:20.273 --> 01:20:22.817
DAVE: If you had advice for
the next generation of kids.

1855
01:20:22.901 --> 01:20:25.153
because I know that
you want to pass it on.

1856
01:20:25.237 --> 01:20:26.571
Yes.

1857
01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:29.074
DAVE: What would you
tell the next generation?

1858
01:20:31.493 --> 01:20:34.829
Be sincere about what
you're listening to.

1859
01:20:34.913 --> 01:20:38.500
And love what
you're trying to do.

1860
01:20:38.583 --> 01:20:40.835
that's what I would tell 'em.

1861
01:20:40.919 --> 01:20:44.005
What you tell 'em?
I'd like to know.

1862
01:20:44.089 --> 01:20:45.715
If we come back.
will you come back?

1863
01:20:45.799 --> 01:20:47.384
'Cause if you come
back. we'll come back.

1864
01:20:47.467 --> 01:20:48.426
That's the way it works.

1865
01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:52.180
(audience cheering)

1866
01:20:52.264 --> 01:20:53.014
cool.

1867
01:20:54.849 --> 01:20:55.684
I like that.

1868
01:20:57.018 --> 01:20:59.271
That means nobody
has to say goodbye

1869
01:20:59.354 --> 01:21:01.523
'cause we'll see each
other again sometime.

1870
01:21:03.650 --> 01:21:05.277
So we never say goodbye.

1871
01:21:06.862 --> 01:21:09.114
We just say this.

1872
01:21:09.197 --> 01:21:12.200
(upbeat rock music)

1873
01:21:15.787 --> 01:21:18.206
You just play till you die.

1874
01:21:19.207 --> 01:21:21.126
What else you gonna do?

1875
01:21:21.209 --> 01:21:24.963
(Dave speaking indistinctly)

1876
01:21:28.216 --> 01:21:30.302
Here we go! Ah!

1878
01:21:34.222 --> 01:21:36.391
It's really important
to find your thing.

1879
01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:40.437

01:22:31.696 --> 01:22:33.782
Get out in front
of a live audience.

1898
01:22:33.865 --> 01:22:35.116
It's so informative

1899
01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:40.121
and also making that
connection with an audience is.

1900
01:22:41.289 --> 01:22:42.624
I think that's what
makes a great band.

1901
01:22:42.707 --> 01:22:47.712
♪ If anything could ever
be this good again ♪

1902
01:22:48.797 --> 01:22:51.800
♪ The only thing I'll
ever ask of you ♪

1903
01:22:51.883 --> 01:22:56.554
♪ You've got to promise not
to stop when I say when ♪

1904
01:22:56.638 --> 01:22:57.806
♪ She sang ♪

1905
01:22:57.889 --> 01:23:00.558
You have to be
completely committed

1906
01:23:00.642 --> 01:23:04.145
and willing to fucking go
through hell and high water

1907
01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:05.146
to put it lightly.

1908
01:23:06.231 --> 01:23:08.191
Yeah. if you can't
breathe without doing it

1909
01:23:08.274 --> 01:23:10.360
then you're in the right place.

1910
01:23:10.443 --> 01:23:11.653
Really think about it

1911
01:23:11.736 --> 01:23:13.655
and say am I allowing
to give up everything?

1912
01:23:13.738 --> 01:23:14.656
How am I gear taken?

1913
01:23:14.739 --> 01:23:16.533
Have my guitar taken?

1914
01:23:16.616 --> 01:23:20.078
Lose it all for this dream.

1915
01:23:20.161 --> 01:23:23.665
Be yourself and
brace who you are.

1916
01:23:23.748 --> 01:23:27.585
and the greatest tragedy
that could ever be

1917
01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:30.505
is not singing your
song that's inside you.

1918
01:23:30.588 --> 01:23:32.924
(audience cheering)

1919
01:23:33.007 --> 01:23:35.593
♪ And she sang ♪

1920
01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:41.766
Your connecting to the music.

1921
01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:44.561
you're connecting to
your fellow band members

1922
01:23:44.644 --> 01:23:48.189
and you're connecting
to the audience.

1923
01:23:48.273 --> 01:23:51.192
That to me. is what
keeps me alive.

1924
01:23:52.193 --> 01:23:53.945
Are you ready!?

1925
01:23:54.028 --> 01:23:55.947
Let's fucking go.

1926
01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:56.823
Ah!

1927
01:23:59.117 --> 01:24:04.122
♪ If everything could ever
feel this real forever ♪

1928
01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:09.961
♪ If anything could ever
be this good again ♪

1929
01:24:11.129 --> 01:24:13.923
♪ The only thing I'll
ever ask of you ♪

1930
01:24:14.007 --> 01:24:19.012
♪ You've got to promise not
to stop when I say when ♪

1931
01:24:24.851 --> 01:24:27.854
(audience cheering)

1932
01:24:37.572 --> 01:24:41.409
(Dave speaking indistinctly)

1933
01:24:41.493 --> 01:24:44.579
(audience cheering)

1934
01:24:50.710 --> 01:24:51.920
You gotta get in the van

1935
01:24:52.003 --> 01:24:54.506
if you want to make
it in this business.

1936
01:24:55.757 --> 01:25:55.567
(upbeat rock music)
