and he couldn't.

in junior high school.
in civics class.

101
00:06:06.888 --> 00:06:08.498
We would have debates about

like. the race between
Eisenhower and Stevenson

103
00:06:10.892 --> 00:06:13.373
and I was
a closet Stevenson person.

104
00:06:14.896 --> 00:06:17.028
But the arguments
that Roger would make

105
00:06:17.072 --> 00:06:20.467
in favor of Eisenhower
were so persuasive

106
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.166
that I thought. "I don't agree
with you. but I see your point."

107

there was something historic

traditional or patriotic.

of being from Warren. Ohio.

117

was a factory foreman.

118
00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.431
and he was
a very important figure to him.

119
00:07:12.388 --> 00:07:14.956
He was like one of those
prophets from the Old Testament.

120

I was terrified.
but I loved my dad.

123
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.977
His father was a union man
who hated the unions.

124
00:07:36.847 --> 00:07:39.415
Who-- who was frightened
of the unions.

125
00:07:40.503 --> 00:07:43.071
He said to Roger.
"Mark my words.

126

The liberals
will destroy this town."

127
00:07:48.163 --> 00:07:50.861
Now. it's unfair to say
that they did that.

128
00:07:51.079 --> 00:07:54.474
but in the '70s.
that prophecy came true.

129
00:07:55.649 --> 00:07:57.694
And Roger saw

130
00:07:58.129 --> 00:08:00.480
all the industry move out.

131
00:08:01.089 --> 00:08:04.353
Their livelihood was gone.
Overnight.

132
00:08:05.833 --> 00:08:08.966

that people had

133
00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:10.838
disappearing too.

his whole life in fear.

136
00:08:24.286 --> 00:08:26.506
A physical. real fear

137
00:08:27.289 --> 00:08:28.812
of bleeding to death.

138
00:08:32.207 --> 00:08:34.949
He had hemophilia diagnosed

139
00:08:34.992 --> 00:08:36.820
when he was about
four years old.

140
00:08:38.387 --> 00:08:40.041
But he was a survivor.

141
00:08:41.129 --> 00:08:43.174
And he operated fearlessly.

142
00:08:44.349 --> 00:08:47.744
like a lot of people
who have real fears often do.

143
00:08:51.879 --> 00:08:54.838
Roger Ailes: I had a condition
that was passed through women.

144
00:08:54.882 --> 00:08:58.320
In other words. the mother
has to give you hemophilia.

145
00:09:00.061 --> 00:09:02.150
I don't know that that had
anything to do with it.

146
00:09:02.367 --> 00:09:05.893
but I was never particularly
physical with my mother.

147
00:09:06.589 --> 00:09:08.330
I think she was scared of it.

148
00:09:09.244 --> 00:09:11.507
She may have had some feeling

149
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:14.249
about the fact
that I got it from her.

150
00:09:20.908 --> 00:09:24.085
Austin Pendleton:
Roger's daily life
was a fear of annihilation.

151
00:09:25.129 --> 00:09:27.392
He said. "It's like
you walk around all your life

152
00:09:27.436 --> 00:09:29.177
with a time bomb in you."

153
00:09:30.526 --> 00:09:32.615
And I think this allowed him

154
00:09:32.659 --> 00:09:34.965

of other people.

00:10:50.519 --> 00:10:53.348
And we did it
five days a week live.

178
00:10:54.218 --> 00:10:56.786
♪ I bought it
At a second-hand store ♪

179
00:10:57.482 --> 00:10:59.702
I co-created
The Mike Douglas Show.

180
00:11:00.355 --> 00:11:02.313
and I booked all the big stars.

181
00:11:02.357 --> 00:11:04.838
Look. the pig that I am today.
[laughs]

182
00:11:04.881 --> 00:11:06.970
Kenneth Johnson:
Every actor in a movie.

183
00:11:07.014 --> 00:11:09.190
a lot of directors
would come through.

184
00:11:09.494 --> 00:11:11.366
Plus. there were animal acts.

185
00:11:11.714 --> 00:11:13.934
And. obviously. there were
a lot of dieting segments

186
00:11:13.977 --> 00:11:15.326
and that sort of thing.

187
00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:17.546
- Oh. something's on fire here.
- It'll go out.

188
00:11:17.938 --> 00:11:19.461
Launa Newman:
It was just fun.

189
00:11:23.378 --> 00:11:25.946
Kenneth Johnson:
Roger was an associate producer
on the show.

190
00:11:25.989 --> 00:11:27.817
and a guy named Larry Rosen

191
00:11:27.861 --> 00:11:30.298
was really next in line
to be the producer.

192
00:11:30.907 --> 00:11:33.518
Launa Newman: He was
the first producer hired.

193
00:11:33.562 --> 00:11:36.130
He'd been on the show
the longest. next to me.

194
00:11:36.173 --> 00:11:39.699
and it was obviously
gonna be Larry. Uh-uh.

195
00:11:40.569 --> 00:11:42.136
Kenneth Johnson:
Roger convinced Mike

196
00:11:42.179 --> 00:11:44.660
that he would be
the better producer than Larry.

197
00:11:44.965 --> 00:11:48.229
And Roger became the producer
of The Mike Douglas Show.

198
00:11:49.099 --> 00:11:51.014
And that was a big shock

199
00:11:51.754 --> 00:11:55.018
because you couldn't see him
maneuvering.

200
00:11:55.671 --> 00:11:58.674
[aircraft droning]

201
00:12:05.812 --> 00:12:08.902
The only person that I saw
Roger Ailes ever really hit on

202
00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:10.686
was Richard Nixon.

203
00:12:13.254 --> 00:12:16.823
Kenneth Johnson: In 1968. during
the presidential campaign.

204
00:12:16.866 --> 00:12:19.521
when he was going to be running
against Bobby Kennedy.

205
00:12:19.564 --> 00:12:22.959
Nixon came to Philadelphia
because. like all politicians

206
00:12:23.264 --> 00:12:26.180
he recognized the impact that
The Mike Douglas Show had

207
00:12:26.223 --> 00:12:28.225
on millions of people.

208
00:12:28.269 --> 00:12:29.879
Why. you look wonderful.

209
00:12:29.923 --> 00:12:32.012
You're suntanned.
you're rested-looking.

210
00:12:32.055 --> 00:12:33.143
Yes.

211
00:12:33.361 --> 00:12:35.711
Have you ever regretted
entering politics

212
00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:37.452
at such a. an early age?

213
00:12:38.627 --> 00:12:43.414
No. um. politics. of course.
is a. is a great battle.

214
00:12:43.458 --> 00:12:45.242
Uh. all of life
is a great battle.

215
00:12:45.286 --> 00:12:47.941
- Indeed. yes.
- You're really a riot.

216
00:12:47.984 --> 00:12:49.072
[laughing]

217
00:12:50.857 --> 00:12:52.510
Kenneth Johnson:
After the show was over.

218
00:12:52.554 --> 00:12:54.904
Roger pulled Nixon
into his office

219
00:12:54.948 --> 00:12:59.126
just the two of them. and said.
"You need a media advisor."

220
00:12:59.735 --> 00:13:01.345
"What's a media advisor. Roger?"

221
00:13:01.389 --> 00:13:05.567
And Roger said. "I am.
It's a title I just created.

222
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:08.048
You need someone
that can shape you.

223
00:13:08.091 --> 00:13:09.789
that can make you presentable

224
00:13:09.832 --> 00:13:12.487
and the most palatable
you can possibly be

225
00:13:12.748 --> 00:13:15.316
and get you elected president."

226
00:13:16.491 --> 00:13:18.406
And Nixon believed him.

227
00:13:18.667 --> 00:13:21.626
So Roger. very soon after.
left the show

228
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.499
and went off
to produce Richard Nixon.

229
00:13:26.588 --> 00:13:29.809
Roger Ailes:
Let's face it. a lot of people
think Nixon is dull.

230
00:13:29.852 --> 00:13:31.898
They think he's a bore.
a pain in the ass.

231
00:13:31.941 --> 00:13:33.813
We have a sound dollar...

232
00:13:33.856 --> 00:13:35.466
They look at him
as the kind of kid

233
00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:37.294
who always carried the book bag

234
00:13:37.338 --> 00:13:40.036
who was 42 years old
the day he was born.

235
00:13:41.037 --> 00:13:43.953
They figure other kids
got footballs for Christmas.

236
00:13:43.997 --> 00:13:45.825
Nixon got a briefcase.

237
00:13:45.868 --> 00:13:47.130
and he loved it.

238
00:13:47.174 --> 00:13:48.697
...projects that otherwise
would be feasible.

239
00:13:48.871 --> 00:13:50.960
Nixon needed someone
who had knowledge of

240
00:13:51.004 --> 00:13:54.007
and command
of the use of television.

241
00:13:54.224 --> 00:13:56.574
And that. of course.
was reinforced

242
00:13:56.618 --> 00:13:58.881
by what had happened to him
in 1960.

243
00:14:00.709 --> 00:14:02.667
Felycia Sugarman: That was
the Nixon-Kennedy debate

244
00:14:02.711 --> 00:14:04.495
where Nixon loses to Kennedy

245
00:14:04.539 --> 00:14:06.802
because he sweats on television.

246
00:14:07.107 --> 00:14:08.760
[Kennedy indistinctly speaking]

247
00:14:08.804 --> 00:14:11.676
Pat Buchanan: He looked bad.
He had not put on makeup.

248
00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.157
And even his own mother
was calling in

249
00:14:14.201 --> 00:14:17.465
and asking how her son was.
Was he okay?

250
00:14:18.248 --> 00:14:21.643
Felycia Sugarman:
And. of course. Kennedy went on
to become president.

251
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:24.385
So Roger told Nixon

252
00:14:25.081 --> 00:14:28.171
"If you don't take television
seriously this time

253
00:14:28.215 --> 00:14:29.520
you're gonna lose again."

254
00:14:30.695 --> 00:14:33.698
Roger Ailes:
I'm gonna fire this fucking
director right after the show.

255
00:14:33.742 --> 00:14:36.527
I mean. look at the positioning
of these cameras.

256
00:14:36.571 --> 00:14:39.879
I told him 50 times.
"I want close-ups."

257
00:14:39.922 --> 00:14:41.228
Close-ups.

258
00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:44.318
I wanna see faces.
I wanna see pores.

259
00:14:44.361 --> 00:14:47.060
That's what people are.
That's what television is.

260
00:14:47.364 --> 00:14:48.844
I don't give a fuck
about the seats.

261
00:14:49.105 --> 00:14:51.760
I gave up 30 seats
to get a tight show.

262
00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:56.373
Kenneth Johnson: Roger and I
had had many conversations

263
00:14:56.417 --> 00:14:59.855
about the power
of. uh. the media

264
00:15:00.464 --> 00:15:03.990
and particularly.
the great Nazi propaganda film

265
00:15:04.033 --> 00:15:06.557
by Leni Riefenstahl.
Triumph Of The Will.

266
00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:09.647
[speaking in German]

267
00:15:09.691 --> 00:15:11.519
And I talked to Roger a lot

268
00:15:11.562 --> 00:15:14.043
about the specific
camera angles that she used

269
00:15:14.087 --> 00:15:15.915
to make Hitler seem heroic

270
00:15:16.611 --> 00:15:19.266
and about putting it
in the right kind of setting

271
00:15:19.309 --> 00:15:21.746
which made it so powerful.

272
00:15:22.095 --> 00:15:24.097
And Roger told me
he really thought about that

273
00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.926
when he created for Nixon. um

274
00:15:26.969 --> 00:15:28.318
"The Man In The Arena."

275
00:15:29.798 --> 00:15:31.234
male announcer #2:
Tonight from Philadelphia.

276
00:15:31.278 --> 00:15:35.456
live and in color.
Nixon In Pennsylvania.

277
00:15:36.848 --> 00:15:39.416
Tonight. Richard Nixon.
in person. is going to face

278
00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:42.942
a panel of citizens asking
questions they want answered.

279
00:15:44.204 --> 00:15:47.642
Kenneth Johnson:
He put him in the arena
surrounded by the audience.

280
00:15:48.512 --> 00:15:51.951
And. uh. it was
an amazing propaganda piece.

281
00:15:52.821 --> 00:15:55.955
I'd like to stress the point
that this is a live program.

282
00:15:57.043 --> 00:16:00.263
male announcer #3:
No one has any idea
what questions will be asked.

283
00:16:00.829 --> 00:16:02.874
Mr. Nixon
cannot possibly know.

284
00:16:02.918 --> 00:16:05.747
male announcer #2:
Tonight from Atlanta.
The Nixon Answer.

285
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:09.229
You have to have the big stroke
of the federal government

286
00:16:09.272 --> 00:16:12.275
in order to handle
a particular problem like that.

287
00:16:12.319 --> 00:16:13.494
Richard Nixon.

288
00:16:15.104 --> 00:16:18.586
We've got the power. we've got
a wonderfully motivated people.

289
00:16:18.803 --> 00:16:20.109
male announcer #3:
Richard Nixon.

290
00:16:22.111 --> 00:16:23.330
Well. anyway. uh...

291
00:16:24.418 --> 00:16:27.377
male announcer #4:
With 287 electoral votes

292
00:16:27.595 --> 00:16:32.208
Richard Nixon goes over the top
to win the 1968 election.

293
00:16:32.513 --> 00:16:34.645
[crowd cheering]

294
00:16:40.129 --> 00:16:41.696
Good evening.
I'm Mike Wallace.

295
00:16:42.044 --> 00:16:44.655
For better or worse.
television has changed

296
00:16:44.699 --> 00:16:47.832
the nature of the political
process in the United States.

297
00:16:47.876 --> 00:16:49.312
- [applause]
- Right. Okay.

298
00:16:49.356 --> 00:16:51.749
This year.
another innovation was tried.

299
00:16:51.793 --> 00:16:54.143
The controlled discussion
with the questioners

300
00:16:54.361 --> 00:16:56.232
picked
by the candidate's producer.

301
00:16:56.667 --> 00:16:58.843
male anchor #2:
Roger Ailes was that producer.

302
00:16:58.887 --> 00:17:00.410
And in the book.
The Selling Of The President.

303
00:17:00.628 --> 00:17:02.325
he was given a good share
of the credit

304
00:17:02.369 --> 00:17:03.892
for the successful format.

305
00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:05.850
male #1: In your estimation.
is television

306
00:17:05.894 --> 00:17:07.678
the single most important factor

307
00:17:07.722 --> 00:17:09.376
in a winning political campaign?

308
00:17:09.724 --> 00:17:11.508
Let me put it this way.
I don't believe

309
00:17:11.552 --> 00:17:15.034
any. anyone will ever be elected

310
00:17:15.077 --> 00:17:16.948
to a major public office again

311
00:17:16.992 --> 00:17:19.386
including mayors of big cities

312
00:17:19.864 --> 00:17:22.041
without the skillful use
of television.

313
00:17:22.824 --> 00:17:24.260
And that skillful use

314
00:17:24.739 --> 00:17:27.263
is that an illumination
of the issues

315
00:17:27.655 --> 00:17:30.571
or an emotional sell
of the man involved?

316
00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.181
I think both.

317
00:17:33.095 --> 00:17:35.532
I think both. I don't think you
can isolate one or the other.

318
00:17:35.576 --> 00:17:37.230
I think that there's
an emotional reaction

319
00:17:37.273 --> 00:17:40.015
to what you see on the screen
regardless of what it is.

320
00:17:47.022 --> 00:17:49.720
John Cook: When I was first
reporting on Fox News

321
00:17:49.764 --> 00:17:52.201
everyone knew
what Roger Ailes' history was.

322
00:17:52.245 --> 00:17:54.464
That he was an aide to Nixon

323
00:17:54.682 --> 00:17:56.640
and-and other
Republican presidents.

324
00:17:56.684 --> 00:17:58.077
but it was kind of
below the radar.

325
00:17:59.165 --> 00:18:02.951
So I filed information requests
with the Nixon archives.

326
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:05.388
And one of the things
that I discovered

327
00:18:05.432 --> 00:18:07.738
was this astonishing document

328
00:18:07.782 --> 00:18:10.567
called A Plan
To Put The GOP On TV.

329
00:18:11.612 --> 00:18:13.396
Its author is unclear.

330
00:18:13.744 --> 00:18:15.268
However. the copy I obtained

331
00:18:15.572 --> 00:18:18.227
had Roger Ailes' handwriting
all over it

332
00:18:18.575 --> 00:18:21.491
in notes that were directed
to H.R. Haldeman.

333
00:18:21.709 --> 00:18:23.972
a-a top aide
in the Nixon White House.

334
00:18:25.321 --> 00:18:28.194
And the memo said
the liberal elite

335
00:18:28.237 --> 00:18:32.067
has a chokehold
on the national news networks.

336
00:18:32.372 --> 00:18:35.244
but local television stations
in Wisconsin

337
00:18:35.288 --> 00:18:37.986
and in Utah
have their own news programs

338
00:18:38.334 --> 00:18:40.815
and they are hungry
for footage.

339
00:18:42.773 --> 00:18:44.732
So it was a proposal

340
00:18:44.775 --> 00:18:47.952
that the Nixon White House.
with taxpayer dollars.

341
00:18:47.996 --> 00:18:51.304
fund an operation
that would interview

342
00:18:51.347 --> 00:18:54.655
Republican members of Congress.
in Washington.

343
00:18:55.003 --> 00:18:58.441
and fly the footage
to these local stations

344
00:18:58.485 --> 00:19:01.488
so that they can get a message
out to their constituents

345
00:19:01.749 --> 00:19:04.926
without having to rely
on the institutional press.

346
00:19:06.623 --> 00:19:09.844
And Roger Ailes is all over it
saying. "I can do this."

347
00:19:13.195 --> 00:19:16.155
Now. it never happened.
but the idea

348
00:19:16.198 --> 00:19:18.983
the germ goes straight into
what Fox News is all about.

349
00:19:19.201 --> 00:19:20.507
...our immigration could be...

350
00:19:20.768 --> 00:19:23.118
How do we get a message
to the people

351
00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:25.816
without having to go through
a critical press?

352
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.863
[indistinct chatter]

353
00:19:41.702 --> 00:19:44.661
I think that Roger
was a kind of genius.

354
00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.361
in the sense
that he created something

355
00:19:48.404 --> 00:19:50.232
that didn't exist before.

356
00:19:53.192 --> 00:19:56.586
And I think that there
is a "Citizen Kane" quality

357
00:19:56.804 --> 00:19:58.066
to his life.

358
00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.157
And I remember
he told me this story

359
00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:05.856
that when he was a boy.
he and his brother had bunk beds

360
00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.337
and Roger was on the top bunk

361
00:20:08.381 --> 00:20:10.339
and his dad walked in

362
00:20:10.383 --> 00:20:12.646
and opened up his arms and said

363
00:20:12.689 --> 00:20:14.474
"Jump. Roger. Jump."

364
00:20:14.517 --> 00:20:17.216
And Roger jumped
and his father stepped away

365
00:20:17.433 --> 00:20:19.696
and Roger fell on the ground.

366
00:20:21.263 --> 00:20:23.352
And his father
looked down on him and he said

367
00:20:23.396 --> 00:20:25.354
"Don't trust anybody."

368
00:20:28.096 --> 00:20:31.012
And I still have an image
of Roger's face

369
00:20:31.055 --> 00:20:32.579
when he would tell me that.

370
00:20:33.841 --> 00:20:35.321
I felt like he was searching.

371
00:20:35.364 --> 00:20:38.106
He was like. "How could my dad
do that to me?"

372
00:20:41.109 --> 00:20:43.111
So there was a lot anger.

373
00:20:43.503 --> 00:20:45.548
There was a lot of anger.

374
00:20:46.723 --> 00:20:49.117
And I think
he capitalized on that.

375
00:20:53.426 --> 00:20:55.558
male #1 on TV: Al D'Amato.
a family man fighting...

376
00:20:55.602 --> 00:20:57.865
male #2 on TV: Deukmejian.
the difference is leadership.

377
00:20:58.126 --> 00:21:00.781
I'm Dan Quayle. I'm very
optimistic about our future.

378
00:21:02.173 --> 00:21:04.915
Felycia Sugarman:
Ailes Communications did
political media consulting

379
00:21:04.959 --> 00:21:07.091
for congressional races.
senatorial races

380
00:21:07.135 --> 00:21:08.441
gubernatorial races.

381
00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:11.748
And we were a small team
doing 14 races

382
00:21:11.792 --> 00:21:13.794
in 14 different states
simultaneously.

383
00:21:15.012 --> 00:21:17.580
Stephen Rosenfield: We did
a lot of executive coaching

384
00:21:17.972 --> 00:21:20.235
and we did political coaching.

385
00:21:21.671 --> 00:21:24.065
And because
of the Nixon campaign

386
00:21:24.108 --> 00:21:26.589
and the fact that he had
pulled that thing off.

387
00:21:26.633 --> 00:21:29.679
you were lucky to get him
and you had to keep him happy.

388
00:21:29.984 --> 00:21:32.595
- man #1: How is that. Roger?
- man #2: Stand by.

389
00:21:32.639 --> 00:21:35.119
male anchor #3:
As Jefferson County Judge.
Mitch McConnell won

390
00:21:35.163 --> 00:21:37.296
national recognition
for exceptional leadership.

391
00:21:37.513 --> 00:21:39.298
Felycia Sugarman:
Mitch McConnell was a judge.

392
00:21:39.341 --> 00:21:41.300
He was way down in the polls.

393
00:21:41.561 --> 00:21:42.953
He was going to lose.

394
00:21:44.215 --> 00:21:47.480
And Roger was hired
to do a bunch of commercials.

395
00:21:48.916 --> 00:21:50.700
So we were doing
a fishing spot

396
00:21:51.179 --> 00:21:54.269
and we had him in the boat.
fishing rod in hand.

397
00:21:54.835 --> 00:21:58.795
We put a worm and a fish
on the hook

398
00:21:58.839 --> 00:22:00.449
reeled it into the water

399
00:22:00.493 --> 00:22:02.451
and then we hear
this little voice go

400
00:22:02.495 --> 00:22:05.628
"What do I do now. Rog?"
And it was Mitch McConnell.

401
00:22:05.672 --> 00:22:08.327
And Roger looks at me
and I look at him and Roger says

402
00:22:08.544 --> 00:22:10.633
you know. "Reel in the fucking
fish. Mitch." [laughs]

403
00:22:12.374 --> 00:22:17.205
Mitch didn't move
without listening to Roger.

404
00:22:19.207 --> 00:22:22.689
And a month later.
he's a U.S. senator.

405
00:22:26.649 --> 00:22:28.477
I'm here with Roger Ailes
who has been called

406
00:22:28.521 --> 00:22:31.350
the Ernest Hemingway
of campaign advisors.

407
00:22:32.002 --> 00:22:34.396
male anchor #4:
The bearded veteran
of many political wars

408
00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.746
Roger Ailes.
arrives early this morning

409
00:22:36.964 --> 00:22:38.531
for a final day of practice.

410
00:22:39.445 --> 00:22:41.534
Bo Dietl:
From 1984 to 1988

411
00:22:41.577 --> 00:22:45.102
Roger was the absolute number
one Republican strategist.

412
00:22:45.146 --> 00:22:47.409
male anchor #5: Roger Ailes.
former TV man for Nixon

413
00:22:47.453 --> 00:22:49.542
was seen here in South Dakota
this fall.

414
00:22:49.977 --> 00:22:52.545
Felycia Sugarman:
We were in every state
in the country

415
00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.504
and Roger was a pivotal figure

416
00:22:55.548 --> 00:22:57.419
in getting Ronald Reagan
elected.

417
00:22:58.246 --> 00:23:00.030
He was like a kingmaker.

418
00:23:00.727 --> 00:23:04.513
And he knew that he could blow
his opponents out of the water.

419
00:23:04.557 --> 00:23:05.775
And that's what he did.

420
00:23:16.569 --> 00:23:20.355
Stephen Rosenfield: I remember.
I came into the office one day.

421
00:23:20.616 --> 00:23:23.750
and he said. "You may have
to take over for a few days

422
00:23:24.359 --> 00:23:26.579
because I was arrested.

423
00:23:27.362 --> 00:23:30.409
Um. I was carrying a gun
in Central Park

424
00:23:31.018 --> 00:23:33.281
so I may go to jail."

425
00:23:34.543 --> 00:23:36.415
And I didn't know he had a gun.

426
00:23:37.503 --> 00:23:40.070
But Roger was.
you know. he was a maverick.

427
00:23:40.114 --> 00:23:42.943
he was a bad boy.
and. uh. he liked that.

428
00:23:46.425 --> 00:23:48.601
Roger Ailes: I know you've heard
people are afraid of me.

429
00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:51.125
I don't remember
threatening anybody.

430
00:23:52.256 --> 00:23:54.258
But if somebody comes to me
looking for a fight

431
00:23:54.302 --> 00:23:55.608
they might get one.

432
00:23:56.304 --> 00:23:58.219
My dad taught me how to fight.

433
00:23:58.654 --> 00:24:00.482
He said. "Remember. son.

434
00:24:00.526 --> 00:24:03.833
for them. it's a fight.
for you. it's life or death."

435
00:24:09.273 --> 00:24:11.101
female anchor #2: And now
to tonight's Focus '88 coverage

436
00:24:11.145 --> 00:24:12.712
of the race
for the White House.

437
00:24:12.755 --> 00:24:14.801
President Reagan
is stopping in Texas

438
00:24:14.844 --> 00:24:17.630
trying to help the George Bush
for president campaign.

439
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.459
female anchor #3: An NBC News-
Wall Street Journal poll

440
00:24:20.502 --> 00:24:22.112
shows Dukakis beating Bush

441
00:24:22.156 --> 00:24:24.985
by 15 points in a head-to-head.

442
00:24:25.289 --> 00:24:27.553
- Try with the glasses.
- producer: Five seconds.

443
00:24:27.596 --> 00:24:30.425
Bush has already initiated
damage control.

444
00:24:31.121 --> 00:24:34.473
Big Rog. how are you. pal?
I'm glad to see you.

445
00:24:34.516 --> 00:24:37.345
Diane Donati:
First thing I did was
with. uh. George H.W. Bush.

446
00:24:38.128 --> 00:24:40.609
Roger was running an ad
for a production manager.

447
00:24:40.653 --> 00:24:42.306
And when I realized what it was

448
00:24:43.046 --> 00:24:45.135
which was Republican commercials

449
00:24:45.179 --> 00:24:47.181
I said. "I don't think
I really want this."

450
00:24:47.442 --> 00:24:50.880
I was always very liberal.
but. um. I needed a job.

451
00:24:51.098 --> 00:24:52.621
[indistinct chatter]

452
00:24:52.665 --> 00:24:53.883
What's going on?

453
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:57.147
Vice President Bush
was a real gentleman.

454
00:24:57.496 --> 00:25:00.934
And I don't think he understood
the down and dirty.

455
00:25:00.977 --> 00:25:03.458
the world Roger could relate to.

456
00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:06.461
Roger always knew

457
00:25:06.505 --> 00:25:08.768
the lowest common denominator
in people.

458
00:25:08.811 --> 00:25:10.552
He knew how to strike at that.

459
00:25:12.032 --> 00:25:14.817
And I think
that's why George used Roger.

460
00:25:14.861 --> 00:25:17.037
He needed a bulldog.
he needed somebody

461
00:25:17.211 --> 00:25:19.126
who could play that game.

462
00:25:20.344 --> 00:25:22.346
And that might have been
the beginning of it.

463
00:25:22.738 --> 00:25:25.306
of the negative.
really negative ads.

464
00:25:25.524 --> 00:25:28.178
male #2:
Which candidate for president
gave weekend passes

465
00:25:28.222 --> 00:25:30.485
to first-degree murderers
who were not even eligible

466
00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:32.618
for parole? Michael Dukakis.

467
00:25:32.661 --> 00:25:35.229
male #3: Dukakis not only
opposes the death penalty

468
00:25:35.403 --> 00:25:36.839
he allowed
first-degree murderers

469
00:25:36.883 --> 00:25:39.189
to have weekend passes
from prison.

470
00:25:39.233 --> 00:25:41.975
One was Willie Horton
who murdered a boy in a robbery

471
00:25:42.018 --> 00:25:44.020
stabbing him 19 times.

472
00:25:44.064 --> 00:25:46.370
Despite a life sentence.
Horton received

473
00:25:46.414 --> 00:25:48.590
ten weekend passes from prison.

474
00:25:48.634 --> 00:25:51.462
Horton fled. kidnapped a young
couple. stabbing the man

475
00:25:51.506 --> 00:25:53.595
and repeatedly raping
his girlfriend.

476
00:25:53.639 --> 00:25:56.903
Weekend Prison Passes.
Dukakis On Crime.

477
00:25:58.426 --> 00:26:00.036
The message
of the Willie Horton ad was

478
00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.473
"If you elect Michael Dukakis.

479
00:26:02.517 --> 00:26:04.563
he's going to let all
these black men out of prison

480
00:26:04.606 --> 00:26:08.001
to come and stab your children.
rape your wives."

481
00:26:08.044 --> 00:26:09.611
- It's true.
- You think it's racist?

482
00:26:09.655 --> 00:26:12.048
No. I don't think it's racist.
I think the man I see there

483
00:26:12.092 --> 00:26:13.615
is neither black nor white.

484
00:26:13.659 --> 00:26:15.704
If you put a white man up there.
would that be racist?

485
00:26:15.748 --> 00:26:17.358
But it has that effect
of scaring the dickens

486
00:26:17.401 --> 00:26:19.752
- out of white people. right?
- Well. the Bush campaign

487
00:26:20.056 --> 00:26:21.710
had absolutely nothing to do
with that ad.

488
00:26:21.754 --> 00:26:24.583
In fact. I wish
it'd never have aired.

489
00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.020
Sarah Ellison: He says
he didn't do the first one

490
00:26:27.063 --> 00:26:29.196
the most controversial ad.

491
00:26:30.414 --> 00:26:33.069
But he certainly promoted
the entire storyline

492
00:26:33.113 --> 00:26:37.073
of Willie Horton
and scary black men.

493
00:26:37.117 --> 00:26:39.336
male #4: While out.
many committed other crimes.

494
00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:43.776
It was revolutionary
at the time. and it worked.

495
00:26:44.298 --> 00:26:45.952
male announcer #5:
Ladies and gentlemen.

496
00:26:45.995 --> 00:26:48.955
the president
of the United States.

497
00:26:49.216 --> 00:26:51.435
[crow cheering]

498
00:26:54.221 --> 00:26:57.616
Felycia Sugarman: There are only
a handful of people

499
00:26:57.659 --> 00:27:01.620
who can so critically

500
00:27:02.229 --> 00:27:05.449
affect the power in this country

501
00:27:06.276 --> 00:27:07.930
over decades.

502
00:27:07.974 --> 00:27:09.758
And Roger's
absolutely one of them.

503
00:27:11.673 --> 00:27:13.283
And when you think
about the people

504
00:27:13.327 --> 00:27:15.764
who are running the country
even now.

505
00:27:15.982 --> 00:27:18.245
all these senators
and congressmen.

506
00:27:18.506 --> 00:27:20.116
he put them there.

507
00:27:22.118 --> 00:27:23.772
Diane Donati:
That's definitely Roger

508
00:27:24.294 --> 00:27:26.470
because his story is about
Nixon or everybody else.

509
00:27:26.514 --> 00:27:31.171
It was what he did for them.
how he made them. you know.

510
00:27:31.345 --> 00:27:34.435
W-Without them. they would
not be where they are.

511
00:27:35.654 --> 00:27:39.658
Felycia Sugarman:
And so everyone wanted to be
in his sphere. Everybody.

512
00:27:40.571 --> 00:27:42.443
You know.
he. he was the big guy. right?

513
00:27:42.922 --> 00:27:46.186
Um. did he take advantage
of that?

514
00:27:46.447 --> 00:27:49.015
I don't. I don't know.
I don't know.

515
00:27:50.799 --> 00:27:52.322
Diane Donati:
"Everybody has an agenda."

516
00:27:52.671 --> 00:27:54.194
He used to say that a lot.

517
00:27:54.629 --> 00:27:58.154
And you have to see what it is
that they're after.

518
00:27:58.372 --> 00:28:00.374
And then you can manipulate them
that way.

519
00:28:01.854 --> 00:28:04.813
I think he liked to pick
on the people

520
00:28:04.857 --> 00:28:07.468
who needed him.
who were vulnerable.

521
00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:11.864
Not just women.
but women were easy targets.

522
00:28:12.691 --> 00:28:15.998
You know. and-and.
but anybody who looked up to him

523
00:28:16.042 --> 00:28:18.958
who wanted to be there.
you know. who thought

524
00:28:19.001 --> 00:28:21.134
"Oh. I'm at the.
you know. top of my game

525
00:28:21.177 --> 00:28:22.831
if I'm working with Roger."

526
00:28:24.354 --> 00:28:26.182
Like. Judy. his secretary.

527
00:28:27.053 --> 00:28:28.315
she worshipped him.

528
00:28:29.055 --> 00:28:31.622
And I knew
anything I said to her

529
00:28:31.666 --> 00:28:36.062
was basically talking in his ear
at the same time. so...

530
00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:38.194
Alexis:
Was she his mistress then?

531
00:28:38.238 --> 00:28:40.936
I can't say that I saw it

532
00:28:41.415 --> 00:28:44.766
specifically. but there were...

533
00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:48.857
I mean. it seemed
a universal acceptance

534
00:28:48.901 --> 00:28:51.555
that everybody knew it
and it was just a giggle.

535
00:28:52.643 --> 00:28:56.125
His wife. Norma. was already
staying at home a lot.

536
00:28:56.343 --> 00:28:58.824
She'd do a little bit
in the editing room and stuff.

537
00:28:58.867 --> 00:29:01.740
but Judy was in constant
contact with her.

538
00:29:02.479 --> 00:29:05.352
And I think that he kind of
liked that he could sort of

539
00:29:05.395 --> 00:29:09.138
play the mistress off the wife
and the wife off the mistress.

540
00:29:10.792 --> 00:29:12.576
I think he was very insecure.

541
00:29:13.316 --> 00:29:16.755
and he needed that feeling
of having a harem.

542
00:29:17.973 --> 00:29:19.888
You know. it's like.
"Look at me. Look at me.

543
00:29:19.932 --> 00:29:23.370
I got 'em both and they do
what I want 'em to do."

544
00:29:26.416 --> 00:29:28.941
Roger Ailes:
My assistant can look at a room

545
00:29:28.984 --> 00:29:32.379
and say. "Watch the fourth guy
on the left.

546
00:29:32.422 --> 00:29:33.772
He hates your guts."

547
00:29:34.642 --> 00:29:36.296
Oh. she can read a room.

548
00:29:36.644 --> 00:29:38.298
She goes in.
she's very friendly

549
00:29:38.994 --> 00:29:40.866
asks if they want coffee

550
00:29:40.909 --> 00:29:42.998
and they think
she's the secretary.

551
00:29:43.956 --> 00:29:46.480
But she's reading the room
before I go in.

552
00:30:00.668 --> 00:30:02.844
Kellie Boyle:
I was a big fan of Roger Ailes.

553
00:30:03.627 --> 00:30:06.848
I had read his book. and
in my industry. he was the man.

554
00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:10.243
My husband was working
with CNBC.

555
00:30:10.286 --> 00:30:11.940
And he said.
"Roger Ailes is coming in.

556
00:30:11.984 --> 00:30:13.159
Would you like to meet him?"

557
00:30:13.333 --> 00:30:14.813
So I thought
that sounded wonderful.

558
00:30:17.467 --> 00:30:20.122
We met in a restaurant
at Union Station

559
00:30:20.166 --> 00:30:21.994
and had a nice meeting.

560
00:30:22.342 --> 00:30:25.214
And I mentioned to Roger that
I was going to sign a contract

561
00:30:25.432 --> 00:30:27.477
with one
of the big national committees.

562
00:30:27.521 --> 00:30:29.653
And this was
a career-making contract.

563
00:30:29.697 --> 00:30:33.701
Um. o-once you hit that level.
uh. you'd made it.

564
00:30:35.355 --> 00:30:37.009
But once we got into his car

565
00:30:37.052 --> 00:30:39.489
we barely pulled away
from Union Station

566
00:30:39.533 --> 00:30:42.841
and he leaned over and said.
"I can really help you.

567
00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:45.321
but if you wanna play
with the big boys.

568
00:30:45.365 --> 00:30:47.193
you have to lay
with the big boys."

569
00:30:47.889 --> 00:30:49.064
[scoffs]

570
00:30:53.503 --> 00:30:57.856
It just came out of nowhere
and it was very transactional.

571
00:30:59.814 --> 00:31:01.860
So at one point.
I sort of sarcastically said.

572
00:31:01.903 --> 00:31:04.819
"Well. now. would I have to be
anybody else's special friend?"

573
00:31:05.254 --> 00:31:08.475
And he said. "Well. you might
have to give a few blowjobs

574
00:31:08.518 --> 00:31:10.912
here and there. but everyone
will know you're with me."

575
00:31:14.698 --> 00:31:16.265
And a million thoughts
are going through my head.

576
00:31:16.483 --> 00:31:17.614
How do I get out of this?

577
00:31:17.658 --> 00:31:18.964
Because I didn't wanna
offend him

578
00:31:19.007 --> 00:31:21.749
and risk some kind of struggle
in the backseat.

579
00:31:21.967 --> 00:31:23.533
So I just said. uh...

580
00:31:23.577 --> 00:31:25.666
"I'm-I'm gonna think about it
and I'll get back to you."

581
00:31:26.058 --> 00:31:28.712
And he said. "Well. you know.
if you don't agree now

582
00:31:28.756 --> 00:31:30.323
there's a good chance
you won't later on."

583
00:31:30.366 --> 00:31:33.108
And I said. "Well. we're just
gonna have to take that risk."

584
00:31:37.069 --> 00:31:39.288
So I dropped him off and. uh.

585
00:31:39.506 --> 00:31:43.727
I just remember.
uh. shaking on the way back

586
00:31:43.771 --> 00:31:47.122
thinking. "Oh... [scoffs]
why did that happen?

587
00:31:47.688 --> 00:31:51.213
What? Why do I have
to put up with that?

588
00:31:51.257 --> 00:31:53.128
Why? Why?" You know...

589
00:31:57.393 --> 00:31:59.656
So the next morning.
I thought. "That's behind me.

590
00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:01.223
I'm not gonna see him again."

591
00:32:01.267 --> 00:32:03.573
So I went to the national
committee for my meeting.

592
00:32:03.617 --> 00:32:05.619
which I had confirmed
the day before.

593
00:32:06.141 --> 00:32:08.230
And I got to the. uh.
the front desk.

594
00:32:08.274 --> 00:32:10.972
and they said. "Oh. he's busy."

595
00:32:11.799 --> 00:32:13.627
I said. "That's strange."

596
00:32:14.193 --> 00:32:16.717
And. um. the next day.

597
00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:19.763
I got a call from Roger Ailes
at home. my home.

598
00:32:19.807 --> 00:32:21.852
and he said.
"How did your meeting go?"

599
00:32:21.896 --> 00:32:25.595
And I said. "Well. very
strangely. it-it didn't happen."

600
00:32:25.639 --> 00:32:27.858
Um. and he said. "Oh.
you'll probably hear from them.

601
00:32:27.902 --> 00:32:29.817
Um. what did you decide?"

602
00:32:30.861 --> 00:32:33.734
And I said. um.
"I'm gonna have to pass. Roger.

603
00:32:33.777 --> 00:32:37.085
Uh. it's just not something
I'm comfortable with."

604
00:32:37.129 --> 00:32:39.609
And. uh. he said.
"Okay. that's. that's fine.

605
00:32:39.653 --> 00:32:41.611
Good luck with everything."

606
00:32:41.655 --> 00:32:43.700
I said.
"Yeah. fine. Okay. good."

607
00:32:43.744 --> 00:32:45.311
So. I hung up and. um

608
00:32:45.833 --> 00:32:47.617
didn't really think
a whole lot more about it

609
00:32:48.009 --> 00:32:50.881
except I wasn't getting
any of my calls returned

610
00:32:50.925 --> 00:32:52.318
to the national committee.

611
00:32:53.188 --> 00:32:55.451
And after a couple of weeks.
I thought

612
00:32:55.495 --> 00:32:56.975
"There's something wrong here."

613
00:32:57.366 --> 00:33:00.804
So I asked a friend
to ask around.

614
00:33:01.022 --> 00:33:03.807
and he called me back
very quickly afterwards

615
00:33:03.851 --> 00:33:06.288
and said.
"You're on a no-hire list."

616
00:33:07.072 --> 00:33:09.509
[scoffs]
I thought. "A no-hire list?"

617
00:33:10.162 --> 00:33:13.339
And then all of sudden.
it all fit into place.

618
00:33:13.774 --> 00:33:16.342
That's what Roger had done
and...

619
00:33:16.951 --> 00:33:18.387
[mumbles]

620
00:33:18.605 --> 00:33:20.389
...that was the end of my
career.

621
00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:33.663
If you wanna have
tremendous political influence

622
00:33:33.707 --> 00:33:36.666
and still be a womanizer.
drug abuser and alcoholic.

623
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:39.365
you only have one choice
of career and that's journalism.

624
00:33:39.713 --> 00:33:41.758
Because journalists
won't attack each other.

625
00:33:41.802 --> 00:33:43.673
They only attack
all the rest of us.

626
00:33:43.717 --> 00:33:44.805
[both laugh]

627
00:33:44.848 --> 00:33:47.199
And anybody who denies it
is lying.

628
00:33:54.336 --> 00:33:56.686
[camera shutter clicking]

629
00:33:59.907 --> 00:34:03.041
Glenn Meehan: I first met
Roger Ailes in the early '90s

630
00:34:03.563 --> 00:34:07.654
when he was starting
an all-talk network

631
00:34:07.697 --> 00:34:09.221
calledAmerica's Talking.

632
00:34:10.004 --> 00:34:12.963
And I think Roger wanted
to be known during this time

633
00:34:13.007 --> 00:34:17.229
as an incredible TV executive.
not a politician.

634
00:34:17.664 --> 00:34:19.231
We congratulate Roger
on his new position

635
00:34:19.448 --> 00:34:21.102
- as Geraldo Rivera's boss.
- [Roger laughs]

636
00:34:21.885 --> 00:34:23.061
I'm politically correct now.

637
00:34:23.104 --> 00:34:25.063
[laughing]

638
00:34:25.106 --> 00:34:26.673
It was an image thing

639
00:34:26.716 --> 00:34:29.415
and he really wanted
to bury his political past.

640
00:34:30.416 --> 00:34:32.548
First. I wanna ask you.
why a talk network?

641
00:34:32.592 --> 00:34:34.985
You know. it seems
that talk shows. uh. come and go

642
00:34:35.029 --> 00:34:37.031
the networks
are saturated with them.

643
00:34:37.075 --> 00:34:38.902
Why does this seem
a good direction to go?

644
00:34:38.946 --> 00:34:41.427
There is a certain segment
of our society

645
00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:44.778
uh. who-who really want to watch
other Americans

646
00:34:44.952 --> 00:34:46.562
talking about things
they care about.

647
00:34:46.954 --> 00:34:48.564
And. um.
I think you're gonna see

648
00:34:48.608 --> 00:34:50.958
a big audience develop
for this kind of thing.

649
00:34:51.437 --> 00:34:54.440
announcer: America's Talking.
a new form of news.

650
00:34:56.137 --> 00:34:59.271
America's Talking
was Roger's baby.

651
00:35:00.446 --> 00:35:03.101
And every single host.

652
00:35:03.144 --> 00:35:05.277
every single show idea.

653
00:35:05.625 --> 00:35:07.888
was from Roger's mind.

654
00:35:09.455 --> 00:35:12.066
He created 12 hours of TV live.

655
00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:16.114
[chuckles]
That's almost insane.

656
00:35:16.505 --> 00:35:18.116
E. Jean on TV:
Today onAsk E. Jean...

657
00:35:18.638 --> 00:35:20.727
And I would say
horrible. hideous stuff

658
00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:24.948
about how some women are able
to ejaculate like men.

659
00:35:25.645 --> 00:35:26.820
Roger didn't care.

660
00:35:28.213 --> 00:35:31.520
As long as the show was juicy
and interesting.

661
00:35:31.999 --> 00:35:33.305
he was all for it.

662
00:35:34.828 --> 00:35:36.612
Hello. I'm Terry Anzur...

663
00:35:36.656 --> 00:35:39.137
Short skirts were encouraged.

664
00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:42.270
and on America's Talking.
I had a see-through desk.

665
00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:45.273
And underneath were lights

666
00:35:45.317 --> 00:35:47.188
that shined on my legs.

667
00:35:48.624 --> 00:35:51.149
They didn't put the light
on Chris Matthews' legs.

668
00:35:51.192 --> 00:35:53.107
- Goodnight. Chris.
- Goodnight. Terry.

669
00:35:53.151 --> 00:35:54.761
You know. when I look back
at America's Talking

670
00:35:54.804 --> 00:35:57.155
I realize that there was so much

671
00:35:57.503 --> 00:35:59.853
that you saw on Fox later on.

672
00:36:00.114 --> 00:36:02.464
The mainstream media
in America

673
00:36:02.508 --> 00:36:04.510
is biased and abusive
in their...

674
00:36:04.988 --> 00:36:07.295
Glenn Meehan: A lot of people
don't know that Sean Hannity

675
00:36:07.339 --> 00:36:09.993
started onAmerica's Talking
covering the O.J. trial.

676
00:36:10.037 --> 00:36:11.908
Hello. I'm Bill O'Reilly.
Thank you for watching...

677
00:36:11.952 --> 00:36:14.433
And Bill O'Reilly was doing
Inside Edition.

678
00:36:14.476 --> 00:36:17.131
He would fill in for Roger
every once in a while

679
00:36:17.392 --> 00:36:19.525
and that's really how
they got to know each other.

680
00:36:20.265 --> 00:36:22.180
But I think deep down inside

681
00:36:22.223 --> 00:36:25.835
Roger wanted to be
in front of the camera.

682
00:36:25.879 --> 00:36:28.664
In fact. at America's Talking.
he gave himself a show.

683
00:36:29.056 --> 00:36:31.276
announcer: Straight Forward.
with Roger Ailes.

684
00:36:31.319 --> 00:36:33.452
My staff told you
I didn't want the drag queens.

685
00:36:33.495 --> 00:36:35.454
- Did they tell you that?
- It's cross-dressing.

686
00:36:35.497 --> 00:36:37.978
It's been going on
since the Mona Leo.

687
00:36:38.239 --> 00:36:40.285
I know. I'm-I'm.
for instance. a female.

688
00:36:40.328 --> 00:36:42.200
You would never guess that.

689
00:36:42.243 --> 00:36:44.811
- I've lived this long.
- That would be okay. [laughs]

690
00:36:45.028 --> 00:36:46.682
We'll be right back
with the first brother

691
00:36:46.726 --> 00:36:48.206
Roger Clinton. Stay with us.

Glenn Meehan: I think
Roger loved show business.

696
00:36:57.911 --> 00:36:59.608
He just loved the spotlight.

697
00:37:00.392 --> 00:37:02.045
You know.
he used to take tap dancing

698
00:37:02.089 --> 00:37:04.526
back in those days
for exercise.

699
00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:06.702
I think that's who
Roger really wanted to be.

700
00:37:07.268 --> 00:37:09.749
[tapping]

701
00:37:11.533 --> 00:37:13.187
Roger Ailes:
Right now. everybody thinks

702
00:37:13.231 --> 00:37:15.711
I'm the greatest guy
in the world.

703
00:37:15.755 --> 00:37:17.539
I'm sure
you've heard that a lot.

704
00:37:19.454 --> 00:37:22.022
My doctor told me
I'm old. fat and ugly.

705
00:37:22.457 --> 00:37:25.373
But none of those things
is gonna kill me immediately.

706
00:37:28.115 --> 00:37:30.204
Everybody fears the unknown.

707
00:37:30.248 --> 00:37:32.380
but I have a strong feeling

708
00:37:32.424 --> 00:37:34.252
there's something bigger
than us.

709
00:37:36.254 --> 00:37:39.779
E. Jean Carroll: Beth Tilson
was a CNBC executive

710
00:37:39.953 --> 00:37:43.870
who was promoted
to help runAmerica's Talking.

711
00:37:45.001 --> 00:37:47.526
Glenn Meehan: Before then.
it was always Roger and Judy.

712
00:37:47.569 --> 00:37:48.962
Roger's assistant.

713
00:37:49.441 --> 00:37:52.661
You almost said their two names
in the same breath always.

714
00:37:52.879 --> 00:37:54.141
Then it was Beth and Roger.

715
00:37:55.185 --> 00:37:56.665
E. Jean Carroll:
Beth was a cross

716
00:37:56.883 --> 00:37:59.755
between Marilyn Monroe
and a schoolmarm.

717
00:37:59.799 --> 00:38:02.976
and had eyes
for only one person

718
00:38:03.324 --> 00:38:04.630
and that was Roger.

719
00:38:10.505 --> 00:38:11.898
Oh. the wedding!

720
00:38:11.941 --> 00:38:15.380
Beth had a white suit with fur.
very elegant.

721
00:38:15.423 --> 00:38:16.685
Roger was in black.

722
00:38:17.599 --> 00:38:20.298
Giuliani was the officiant.

723
00:38:20.646 --> 00:38:22.822
And it was just me
and Barbara Walters.

724
00:38:23.388 --> 00:38:24.954
And Geraldo was there.

725
00:38:25.651 --> 00:38:28.175
And Roger. he was so happy.

726
00:38:34.181 --> 00:38:37.489
Terry Anzur:
We reached the magic number
of 20 million subscribers.

727
00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:39.969
And all of a sudden.

728
00:38:40.013 --> 00:38:42.320
it wasn't Roger's little
playground anymore.

729
00:38:43.146 --> 00:38:46.628
NBC went.
"Wow. this is a real channel

730
00:38:46.672 --> 00:38:49.544
and we should be getting
more value out of it."

731
00:38:52.939 --> 00:38:54.984
Glenn Meehan:
Now. the story goes

732
00:38:55.028 --> 00:38:57.857
that Bill Gates
wanted a news network.

733
00:38:58.727 --> 00:39:02.209
So he approached NBC
with his checkbook

734
00:39:02.601 --> 00:39:05.995
and NBC said. "We've got
this network over in Fort Lee

735
00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:08.868
calledAmerica's Talking.
It's yours."

736
00:39:11.392 --> 00:39:14.003
female anchor #4:
A new partnership
between NBC and Microsoft

737
00:39:14.047 --> 00:39:15.614
is heating up the media wars.

738
00:39:15.657 --> 00:39:17.442
The two companies
have announced a new

739
00:39:17.485 --> 00:39:20.445
24-hour. worldwide
cable TV news channel.

740
00:39:20.488 --> 00:39:22.708
It is called MSNBC.

741
00:39:22.751 --> 00:39:24.492
And NBC president Bob Wright

742
00:39:24.536 --> 00:39:26.712
says he hopes to have it
up and running by summer.

743
00:39:31.717 --> 00:39:34.937
Felycia Sugarman:
I got a phone call
from a friend of mine saying.

744
00:39:34.981 --> 00:39:37.505
"Your friend Roger
threw a chair across the room

745
00:39:37.549 --> 00:39:39.725
called the car and stormed out
of the building."

746
00:39:42.031 --> 00:39:45.208
So I called Roger in his car
and I said.

747
00:39:45.252 --> 00:39:48.386
"Hey. I heard something
went down. Are you okay?"

748
00:39:48.647 --> 00:39:52.041
And he said.
"Felycia. I'm gonna fuck them.

749
00:39:52.085 --> 00:39:54.914
I'm gonna fuck them like they
have never been fucked before."

750
00:39:58.004 --> 00:40:00.049
And I knew something
would be born

751
00:40:00.093 --> 00:40:02.269
out of this need for revenge.

752
00:40:04.402 --> 00:40:05.794

at such a short notice.

755
00:40:10.886 --> 00:40:12.888
I'd just like to say
how delighted I am

756
00:40:12.932 --> 00:40:14.368
that we've now reached
this moment

757
00:40:14.412 --> 00:40:16.239
when we can firmly announce

758
00:40:16.283 --> 00:40:19.199
uh. the starting
of a Fox News Channel.

759
00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:21.070
Uh. we've been very lucky
in being able

760
00:40:21.114 --> 00:40:24.247
to obtain the services
of Mr. Roger Ailes

761
00:40:24.291 --> 00:40:26.772
who has had
such a fantastic success.

762
00:40:26.815 --> 00:40:28.513
Uh. Mr. Ailes is here

763
00:40:28.556 --> 00:40:30.558
and. uh. he might like to add
a few words.

764
00:40:30.776 --> 00:40:32.604
but we'll be waiting
to take your questions.

765
00:40:32.647 --> 00:40:35.215
Uh. it really is exciting
to join what I think

766
00:40:35.258 --> 00:40:38.827
is. uh. the most dynamic.
uh. television company

767

Uh. and I've always admired
Mr. Murdoch's ability

00:40:43.832 --> 00:40:45.399
to get things done.

770
00:40:45.704 --> 00:40:47.270
It's a tough.

771
00:40:47.314 --> 00:40:49.621

773
00:40:55.844 --> 00:41:00.414
female reporter #3:
The all-news game has become
a serious and a nasty business

774
00:41:00.458 --> 00:41:02.416
as media mogul Rupert Murdoch

775
00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:04.766
enters the 24-hour
news competition

776
00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:06.768
with his Fox News Channel.

777
00:41:06.812 --> 00:41:08.640
male #7:
CNN's Ted Turner insisted

778
00:41:08.683 --> 00:41:12.252
he'd squish the Australian
tycoon like a bug.

779
00:41:13.949 --> 00:41:16.212
Rupert had wanted
to launch something

780
00:41:16.256 --> 00:41:17.823
like Fox News for years.

781
00:41:19.607 --> 00:41:21.783
He loved taking on taboos

782
00:41:21.827 --> 00:41:23.959
in his tabloids in London

783
00:41:25.221 --> 00:41:28.137
and had always wanted
to puncture the establishment.

784
00:41:29.835 --> 00:41:32.707
They wanted us to beat the crap
out of the other cable channels

785
00:41:33.012 --> 00:41:34.013
at their own game.

786
00:41:34.883 --> 00:41:38.147
And about ten weeks before Fox
actually went on the air.

787
00:41:38.191 --> 00:41:40.672
Roger had all of us
in the company come to New York.

788
00:41:41.368 --> 00:41:43.631
And he gave
this rip-roaring speech

789
00:41:43.675 --> 00:41:46.504
about how the networks
had been around for so long

790
00:41:46.547 --> 00:41:48.201
that they were antiquated.

791
00:41:48.462 --> 00:41:50.333
And that we were gonna be
a pirate ship

792
00:41:50.377 --> 00:41:52.510
that while everybody else
were these sort of battleships

793
00:41:52.553 --> 00:41:54.860
and aircraft carriers that would
take a long time to turn around.

794
00:41:55.208 --> 00:41:57.645
we were gonna be nimble.
we were gonna strike hard

795
00:41:57.689 --> 00:41:59.386
and we were gonna have
a whale of a time doing it.

796
00:42:00.909 --> 00:42:03.346
male #8 on TV: Good morning.
welcome to Fox News Channel.

797

[Fox News theme music plays]

798
00:42:10.397 --> 00:42:11.529
[indistinct chatter on TV]

799
00:42:11.572 --> 00:42:13.531
So far. so good. We're on.

800
00:42:14.357 --> 00:42:17.186
David Shuster:
Fox News was an absolute hoot
at the beginning.

801
00:42:17.578 --> 00:42:18.840
Hi. I'm Bill O'Reilly.

802
00:42:18.884 --> 00:42:21.321
Thank you for watching
on our very first day.

803
00:42:21.364 --> 00:42:22.888
There were people
who had worked with Roger

804
00:42:22.931 --> 00:42:25.020
atAmerica's Talking and CNBC.

805
00:42:25.325 --> 00:42:27.719
and some people who worked
with him in a political sphere.

806
00:42:27.762 --> 00:42:30.025
Welcome to Washington.
I'm Brit Hume...

807
00:42:30.069 --> 00:42:31.723
And to all of us who started.
it was like

808
00:42:31.766 --> 00:42:33.246
"Yes! This is great!"

809
00:42:33.551 --> 00:42:35.727
Well. we're going to try
to be different

810
00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:37.250
stimulating and a bit daring.

811
00:42:39.731 --> 00:42:42.777
Loyalty was a theme
that came up every day

812
00:42:43.038 --> 00:42:47.042
because all the people
around Roger would tell us

813
00:42:47.086 --> 00:42:49.305
"You know.
Roger really likes loyalty.

814
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:50.742
Loyalty is really important
to Roger."

815
00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:55.529
And people who would do
something nice for Roger

816
00:42:55.573 --> 00:42:57.357
would often pop up on the air.

817
00:42:57.662 --> 00:42:58.837
We did all sorts of segments

818
00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.578
that didn't make
any sense to me.

819
00:43:00.795 --> 00:43:04.103
They would say F-O-R.
Friend of Roger.

820
00:43:06.671 --> 00:43:09.412
Joe Muto:
It was imparted to me
right from the very beginning

821
00:43:09.456 --> 00:43:10.762
that it wasn't about journalism

822
00:43:10.936 --> 00:43:13.634
it was about drawing
the biggest audience possible.

823
00:43:14.243 --> 00:43:15.767
Uh. what do you got?

824
00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:17.943
A library board
in Helena. Montana

825
00:43:17.986 --> 00:43:20.423
voted unanimously
to keep the book

826
00:43:20.467 --> 00:43:22.730
The Joy Of Gay Sex
on the library shelves.

827
00:43:22.948 --> 00:43:26.604
Alright. that's good. Book that
for the D-block on. uh. Tuesday.

828
00:43:27.126 --> 00:43:29.345
We used to call it
riling up the crazies.

829
00:43:29.389 --> 00:43:30.477
That's what we were there to do.

830
00:43:30.825 --> 00:43:33.611
We were there
to stir up outrage

831
00:43:33.959 --> 00:43:35.961
because that's what
kept them watching.

832
00:43:36.135 --> 00:43:38.441
[intense music]

833
00:43:40.966 --> 00:43:42.924
female reporter #4: Whitewater
Independent Counsel Ken Starr

834
00:43:42.968 --> 00:43:45.013
is reported to have
a number of audio tapes

835
00:43:45.405 --> 00:43:48.103
on which a former White House
intern. Monica Lewinsky

836
00:43:48.147 --> 00:43:50.105
told fellow staff
that she was sexually involved

837
00:43:50.149 --> 00:43:51.846
with the president.

838
00:43:52.455 --> 00:43:54.544
They must have fallen
on their knees at Fox

839
00:43:54.588 --> 00:43:56.111
when the Lewinsky thing hit

840
00:43:56.155 --> 00:43:58.636
and never stopped thanking God

841
00:43:58.853 --> 00:44:00.246
for that blue dress

842
00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:04.772
because Roger and Beth.
they despised the Clintons

843
00:44:04.816 --> 00:44:06.774
and everything they stood for.

844
00:44:09.168 --> 00:44:13.694
Roger Ailes: Bill Clinton
is very slick. very glib.

845
00:44:14.042 --> 00:44:16.654
He has 15.000 press secretaries.

846
00:44:16.871 --> 00:44:20.309
and it's clear she's not gonna
get the Betty Crocker Award.

847
00:44:21.093 --> 00:44:23.051
I wouldn't stand
too close to her.

848
00:44:24.183 --> 00:44:26.098
Could President Clinton
have had an affair

849
00:44:26.141 --> 00:44:27.708
with an intern
and then try to cover it up?

850
00:44:28.187 --> 00:44:31.059
Fox News correspondent
David Shuster has the story.

851
00:44:31.625 --> 00:44:33.671
David Shuster:
Yesterday the White House
released a response

852
00:44:33.714 --> 00:44:36.195
to Kenneth Starr's
detailed report to Congress.

853
00:44:36.543 --> 00:44:38.937
David Shuster:
The Clinton scandal
was the rocket fuel

854
00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:42.027
that got Fox News
into the stratosphere.

855
00:44:42.767 --> 00:44:45.247
We were kicking
the networks' ass

856
00:44:45.291 --> 00:44:48.033
on this story
day in and day out.

857
00:44:48.207 --> 00:44:51.253
male reporter #2:
Fox News has learned it was
Linda Tripp who befriended...

858
00:44:51.297 --> 00:44:54.300
And within two or three months.
it was

859
00:44:54.343 --> 00:44:56.824
"Wow! Fox News
has something going."

860
00:44:56.868 --> 00:45:00.045
Attorney General has now started
a 90-day preliminary...

861
00:45:00.088 --> 00:45:02.525
...President of the United
States to testify under oath

862
00:45:02.569 --> 00:45:04.353
that he did. in fact. have
sex...

863
00:45:04.397 --> 00:45:06.181
male reporter #3:
Mr. Clinton is also accused

864
00:45:06.225 --> 00:45:08.096
of obstruction of justice.

865
00:45:08.314 --> 00:45:11.317
David Shuster: I remember it was
a huge celebration at Fox News

866
00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:13.623
in New York.
and I was asked to come up

867
00:45:13.667 --> 00:45:15.408
and meet with Roger Ailes
in his office.

868
00:45:16.801 --> 00:45:20.195
This was after we got the
information about the cigars

869
00:45:20.805 --> 00:45:22.850
and he says.
"What is this sex stuff?

870
00:45:22.894 --> 00:45:24.373
What was really going on?"

871
00:45:24.896 --> 00:45:28.377
And so I said. "Well. there
are some rumors about cigars

872
00:45:28.421 --> 00:45:30.989
or something that was involved
in their sexual play."

873
00:45:31.032 --> 00:45:32.686
And Roger loved it!

874
00:45:34.209 --> 00:45:36.603
He was scintillated by it.

875
00:45:37.996 --> 00:45:40.520
But the idea that Bill Clinton
would be sloppy.

876
00:45:40.955 --> 00:45:43.088
allow an intern
to blab to her friend.

877
00:45:43.958 --> 00:45:46.091
that's where that contempt came

878
00:45:46.787 --> 00:45:50.748
because Roger Ailes did not
respect people who got caught.

879
00:45:58.799 --> 00:46:01.584
[chuckles] "There's someone
in the room today

880
00:46:01.802 --> 00:46:04.805
whose wings
are much bigger than mine.

881
00:46:05.110 --> 00:46:10.115
His wings have a wide span
of generosity

882
00:46:10.768 --> 00:46:14.641
that every day
lifts up so many people.

883
00:46:15.294 --> 00:46:17.687
The one and only Roger Ailes."

884
00:46:17.731 --> 00:46:19.298
[applause]

885
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.089
I was beyond flattered

886
00:46:28.829 --> 00:46:32.267
that Roger Ailes
was talking to me like this.

887
00:46:32.311 --> 00:46:34.095
They feel a sense of relief...

888
00:46:34.139 --> 00:46:36.968
Since 11 years old.
I wanted to be a news reporter.

889
00:46:38.143 --> 00:46:40.319
I was working
at this little local TV station

890
00:46:41.059 --> 00:46:42.974
and I got a meeting
with Roger Ailes.

891
00:46:43.409 --> 00:46:47.761
So I went in there and sat at
the seat across from his desk.

892
00:46:47.805 --> 00:46:49.197
He said.
"No. no. come over here."

893
00:46:49.415 --> 00:46:51.591
And then he sat down on a couch

894
00:46:51.634 --> 00:46:54.463
and he patted right next to him.
and he said.

895
00:46:54.507 --> 00:46:55.638
"Come sit right next to me."

896
00:46:57.336 --> 00:46:59.729
He said to me.
"You know. here at Fox News

897
00:46:59.773 --> 00:47:02.471
in order to be beautiful.
it's not just waist up

898
00:47:02.689 --> 00:47:04.952
it is the entire package.

899
00:47:04.996 --> 00:47:08.521
People wanna see a woman
from. you know. head to toe."

900
00:47:09.043 --> 00:47:12.003
And he looked me up and down
admiringly and said.

901
00:47:12.307 --> 00:47:15.484
"You definitely are
beautiful enough to be here."

902
00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:17.878
And I said. "Thank you."
And then he said.

903
00:47:17.922 --> 00:47:19.793
"But I'm not a 100% sure."

904
00:47:19.837 --> 00:47:22.927
He said.
"Stand up and twirl for me.

905
00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:24.798
I-I wanna see everything."

906
00:47:26.539 --> 00:47:28.541
And I-I just looked at him
and laughed.

907
00:47:30.717 --> 00:47:33.763
And then a week later.
a friend of mine had dinner

908
00:47:33.807 --> 00:47:36.897
with Roger Ailes at this
Italian restaurant. midtown.

909
00:47:36.941 --> 00:47:39.204
and he said to me.
"Lidia. he's...

910
00:47:39.465 --> 00:47:42.424
"I talked to him about you.
He... I said...

911
00:47:42.468 --> 00:47:45.688
He-He wasn't. he's not serious
about bringing you on."

912
00:47:45.732 --> 00:47:47.168
I said.
"Well. what do you mean?"

913
00:47:47.212 --> 00:47:49.867
He said. "He. he asked
about you sexually.

914
00:47:50.128 --> 00:47:51.825
He asked
what kind of girl you were."

915
00:47:51.869 --> 00:47:53.000
And I said
you were a good girl.

916
00:47:56.221 --> 00:47:59.615
But I think that it was.
in a way. a test.

917
00:47:59.659 --> 00:48:02.357
I think I failed
because I didn't hear back.

918
00:48:06.884 --> 00:48:09.538
An axis of evil standoff
as Fox reports tonight.

919
00:48:09.756 --> 00:48:11.671
Hello. everyone.
I'm Alisyn Camerota.

920
00:48:11.714 --> 00:48:14.979
If you wanted something...
I wanted more opportunity.

921
00:48:15.022 --> 00:48:16.415
I wanted to try to anchor.

922
00:48:16.589 --> 00:48:19.766
I think that he saw that

923
00:48:20.245 --> 00:48:21.942
as "What do I get out of that?"

924
00:48:22.377 --> 00:48:26.381
And so when I went to him
to ask him for more opportunity

925
00:48:26.425 --> 00:48:27.730
he said.

926
00:48:28.427 --> 00:48:33.084
"Well. I would have to work
with you more closely.

927
00:48:33.562 --> 00:48:34.912
if that were to happen.

928
00:48:35.782 --> 00:48:37.697
I would have to train you

929
00:48:38.176 --> 00:48:40.743
give you sort of tutorials

930
00:48:40.787 --> 00:48:45.052
and. you know.
people might be jealous.

931
00:48:45.096 --> 00:48:46.749
And so we would have to...

932
00:48:46.793 --> 00:48:48.882
It would be best
if we did it away from here.

933
00:48:49.317 --> 00:48:52.407
Um. perhaps
at a hotel sometime.

934
00:48:54.018 --> 00:48:55.323
Do you know what I'm saying?"

935
00:48:57.151 --> 00:48:59.414
And I said. "Yeah. I think
I do know what you're saying."

936
00:48:59.458 --> 00:49:02.678
I mean. I knew I was never going
to go meet Roger at a hotel.

937
00:49:02.722 --> 00:49:05.768
That was unthinkable to me.
that was never going to happen.

938
00:49:05.812 --> 00:49:07.335
But I didn't know
what was gonna happen next.

939
00:49:07.553 --> 00:49:09.555
if I was gonna be
fired if I didn't do it.

940
00:49:09.598 --> 00:49:12.993
I didn't know how he was gonna
make that happen.

941
00:49:14.647 --> 00:49:16.562
I mean. Roger was the king.

942
00:49:16.823 --> 00:49:20.000
His assistant
was the head of HR.

943
00:49:20.479 --> 00:49:22.655
And so it didn't occur to me
that there was somebody

944
00:49:22.916 --> 00:49:25.832
higher than Roger who could have
done something. There wasn't.

945
00:49:26.702 --> 00:49:28.617
Alexis:
And weren't people at Fox News'

946
00:49:28.661 --> 00:49:31.185
putting out
salacious online material?

947
00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:32.970
There were many websites.

948
00:49:33.492 --> 00:49:36.625
Um. I think one was called
The Hot Women Of Fox.

949
00:49:36.974 --> 00:49:39.498
There were different websites
about different body parts.

950
00:49:40.194 --> 00:49:42.501
There were websites
dedicated to feet.

951
00:49:43.371 --> 00:49:45.243
Sarah Ellison:
They wanted people to think
of the network in that way.

952
00:49:45.286 --> 00:49:47.027
They were using the women
who worked there

953
00:49:47.332 --> 00:49:49.116
for a very specific purpose.

954
00:49:49.508 --> 00:49:52.990
Um. and it was to be sexualized
for their viewers.

955
00:49:53.033 --> 00:49:55.166
and. we learned later.
for the people in the building.

956
00:49:57.385 --> 00:50:00.998
Alisyn Camerota: And so that
was the culture of the time

957
00:50:01.041 --> 00:50:03.391
and there was nobody who was
willing to challenge it.

958
00:50:08.353 --> 00:50:11.138
If Fox News is the house
that Roger built

959
00:50:11.182 --> 00:50:13.184
with some help
from Rupert Murdoch.

960
00:50:13.227 --> 00:50:15.490
look at this group here
on this stage with you.

961
00:50:15.534 --> 00:50:17.884
Uh. w-why? Why'd you pick 'em?

962
00:50:18.232 --> 00:50:20.843
Somebody. uh. once asked me
how I hire talent.

963
00:50:21.409 --> 00:50:24.195
And there were...
I've made a list and it was...

964
00:50:24.238 --> 00:50:27.676
There were 27 things
on the list. a secret list.

965
00:50:27.894 --> 00:50:30.027
uh. which one day will come out

966
00:50:30.070 --> 00:50:32.029
in a book I'm writing
about all you people.

967
00:50:32.246 --> 00:50:34.553
[laughing]

968
00:50:35.206 --> 00:50:37.860
This is the deal.
Um. all of us are veterans

969
00:50:37.904 --> 00:50:40.037
uh. that we've worked
for other companies.

970
00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:42.909
and most of those companies
are horror shows.

971
00:50:43.431 --> 00:50:44.867
This company
is a little bit different

972
00:50:44.911 --> 00:50:48.393
because they let you...
They don't micromanage.

973
00:50:48.828 --> 00:50:51.396
And-And Roger Ailes hires people

974
00:50:51.439 --> 00:50:54.921
with whom he has confidence.
and then he lets them go.

975
00:50:55.878 --> 00:50:57.489
Chris: Alright. we have
to take a break here.

976
00:50:57.532 --> 00:50:59.839
and we're gonna be back
and talk about the milestones

977
00:50:59.882 --> 00:51:02.363
that changed Fox News
and changed our country.

978
00:51:11.546 --> 00:51:14.114
Joe Muto:
It was October. 2004.

979
00:51:15.072 --> 00:51:18.075
I came into work one evening.
I was working the evening shift

980
00:51:18.553 --> 00:51:20.077
and I look around the newsroom

981
00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:21.904
and every computer
in the newsroom

982
00:51:21.948 --> 00:51:25.778
was on this website
thesmokinggun.com.

983
00:51:26.431 --> 00:51:28.389
And my buddy is. he's like.
"Dude. you gotta.

984
00:51:28.433 --> 00:51:29.390
you gotta read this shit."

985
00:51:30.826 --> 00:51:33.394
male reporter #4:
It is an absolute bombshell
of an allegation.

986
00:51:33.438 --> 00:51:35.440
female reporter #5:
The sexual harassment case
against popular

987
00:51:35.483 --> 00:51:37.572
cable TV host. Bill O'Reilly.

988
00:51:37.616 --> 00:51:40.445
male reporter #5:
One of his associate producers.
Andrea Mackris

989
00:51:40.749 --> 00:51:42.925
alleges that
in one phone conversation

990
00:51:42.969 --> 00:51:46.103
O'Reilly fantasized. "You would
basically be in the shower.

991
00:51:46.146 --> 00:51:47.713
I would take
that little loofa thing

992
00:51:47.756 --> 00:51:49.715
and kinda soap up your back."

993
00:51:50.672 --> 00:51:52.935
I like the part
about you wanting to rub falafel

994
00:51:52.979 --> 00:51:54.415
on that lady's boobs.

995
00:51:54.633 --> 00:51:56.983
and. uh. the part about
how you love vibrators.

996
00:51:57.157 --> 00:51:58.941
and the part about
how you believed it

997
00:51:58.985 --> 00:52:02.293
when a prostitute told you
you had a big penis. [laughs]

998
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:04.208
You said yesterday
this is one of the most

999
00:52:04.251 --> 00:52:05.687
evil things
you've ever experienced.

1000
00:52:05.731 --> 00:52:07.907
Why so evil? Why do you think
she's doing this?

1001
00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:11.606
I have no clue. but my career
could be ruined

1002
00:52:11.824 --> 00:52:13.956
and I'm very well aware of that.

1003
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.480
But I can't let people do this.

1004
00:52:18.004 --> 00:52:20.659
Sarah Ellison:
What was interesting about
that case with Andrea Mackris

1005
00:52:20.833 --> 00:52:23.140
is she was somebody
who had evidence.

1006
00:52:23.966 --> 00:52:27.274
Multiple recordings of what was
obviously sexual harassment

1007
00:52:27.753 --> 00:52:30.669
and also threats
and intimidation.

1008
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:33.411
"If any woman
ever breathed a word

1009
00:52:33.454 --> 00:52:34.934
I'll make her pay so dearly

1010
00:52:34.977 --> 00:52:36.370
that she'll wish
she'd never been born.

1011
00:52:37.371 --> 00:52:39.852
I'll rake her through the mud.
bring up things in her life

1012
00:52:40.157 --> 00:52:42.507
and make her so miserable
that she'll be destroyed.

1013
00:52:43.203 --> 00:52:45.945
If you cross Fox News Channel.
it's not just me.

1014
00:52:45.988 --> 00:52:48.121
it's Roger Ailes
who will go after you.

1015
00:52:48.426 --> 00:52:50.645
Ailes operates
behind the scenes.

1016
00:52:50.689 --> 00:52:52.952
strategizes
and makes things happen

1017
00:52:52.995 --> 00:52:54.823
so that one day. bam!

1018
00:52:54.867 --> 00:52:56.521
The person gets
what's coming to them.

1019
00:52:56.564 --> 00:52:58.044
but never sees it coming."

1020
00:53:00.873 --> 00:53:03.223
Joe Muto:
It was apparent to everyone
that he was guilty.

1021
00:53:04.050 --> 00:53:05.834
But Bill O'Reilly
had the highest ratings.

1022
00:53:05.878 --> 00:53:07.662
He brought in the most money.

1023
00:53:07.706 --> 00:53:09.664
You know. he was kind of
the face of the network.

1024
00:53:10.187 --> 00:53:11.884
So Roger protected Bill.

1025
00:53:12.145 --> 00:53:16.802
You know. just like Roger
was Rupert Murdoch's cash cow.

1026
00:53:16.845 --> 00:53:19.239
Bill O'Reilly
was Roger Ailes' cash cow.

1027
00:53:21.241 --> 00:53:23.896
So he helped
smooth everything over.

1028
00:53:25.506 --> 00:53:27.682
You want the truth.
you hire Bo Dietl.

1029
00:53:27.726 --> 00:53:30.859
You want something else.
go hire Slime-O PI.

1030
00:53:30.903 --> 00:53:34.211
Find the truth. That's all I do
is find the truth.

1031
00:53:34.863 --> 00:53:38.345
John Cook:
Bo Dietl is a former NYPD cop

1032
00:53:38.389 --> 00:53:41.609
who became a regular
on Fox News.

1033
00:53:42.871 --> 00:53:45.309
He was the go-to guy
to defend stop-and-frisk

1034
00:53:45.352 --> 00:53:48.703
or argue that Trayvon Martin
deserved to die or whatever.

1035
00:53:48.747 --> 00:53:51.358
Where was he.
where was he when two officers

1036
00:53:51.402 --> 00:53:53.055
got killed in New York?

1037
00:53:53.099 --> 00:53:55.188
And he also had
this private eye business

1038
00:53:55.232 --> 00:53:58.060
where he worked for Roger

1039
00:53:58.104 --> 00:54:01.934
doing security and
investigations for Fox News.

1040
00:54:04.763 --> 00:54:08.419
Well. I'll say it right now.
I respected Roger Ailes

1041
00:54:08.462 --> 00:54:11.291
because the man did so much
for America

1042
00:54:11.335 --> 00:54:12.771
and for the people of Fox.

1043
00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:15.904
[indistinct chatter]

1044
00:54:15.948 --> 00:54:19.256
Bo Dietl: On the Mackris case.
we were assigned to follow her

1045
00:54:19.517 --> 00:54:22.346
and to gain any kind
of information we could

1046
00:54:22.389 --> 00:54:24.565
where it was detrimental
to the case.

1047
00:54:25.044 --> 00:54:28.352
Sarah Ellison:
They took the information
that Bo Dietl was digging up

1048
00:54:28.395 --> 00:54:30.310
and leaked it
to The New York Post.

1049
00:54:30.354 --> 00:54:33.139
which was owned
also by Rupert Murdoch.

1050
00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:37.796
Joe Muto:
They said Andrea Mackris
is a slut. She's a drunk.

1051
00:54:38.057 --> 00:54:40.799
She's trying to entrap
Bill O'Reilly.

1052
00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:42.583
Bo Dietl: This is gonna be
a message to people.

1053
00:54:42.627 --> 00:54:44.716
When you file
these frivolous lawsuits

1054
00:54:44.759 --> 00:54:46.587
and you think you're gonna get
people who are well-known

1055
00:54:46.631 --> 00:54:48.763
to give you money
for garbage like this

1056
00:54:48.807 --> 00:54:51.462
we're gonna investigate you.
We're gonna u-uncover things

that we've already
about your life

00:54:53.638 --> 00:54:56.293
so you're wide open right now.
So beware. people.

1059
00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:59.948
That was the tactic. like.
smear her. put pressure on her.

1060
00:55:00.688 --> 00:55:02.821
And as it turns out. it worked.

1061
00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:05.127
They settled it.
She can't talk.

1062
00:55:05.345 --> 00:55:08.087
And he skated.
His ratings went up from there.

1063
00:55:08.130 --> 00:55:09.784
His salary went up from there.

1064
00:55:11.133 --> 00:55:13.484
Fox News was making
so much money. no one cared.

00:55:16.269 --> 00:55:18.227
Good morning. everyone.
today is Thursday

I'm Gretchen Carlson.

Thanks so much for sharing
part of your day with us today.

1069
00:55:23.407 --> 00:55:25.147
Uh. so. Rupert.
what made you think

1070
00:55:25.191 --> 00:55:26.801
that this whole thing
would work?

1071
00:55:27.585 --> 00:55:29.282
I just had a hunch that.
you know

1072
00:55:29.326 --> 00:55:31.458
there was. uh. room
for another point of view

1073
00:55:31.502 --> 00:55:33.373
and. and another service.

1074
00:55:34.374 --> 00:55:37.595
Rupert Murdoch is a genius
in terms of media.

1075
00:55:37.638 --> 00:55:41.338
but. more importantly. what
he does is. he bets on people...

1076
00:55:41.903 --> 00:55:43.818
I don't think we ever had
a written business plan.

1077
00:55:43.862 --> 00:55:46.038
I think we talked through
what we were gonna do

1078
00:55:46.517 --> 00:55:49.650
and he backed it.
but really let me run it.

1079
00:55:49.694 --> 00:55:52.305
Now. if I'd screwed it up.
I'd be dead.

1080
00:55:52.349 --> 00:55:55.352

[indistinct chatter]

1082

E. Jean Carroll: Roger and Beth
were extremely impressed

1083
00:56:12.456 --> 00:56:13.718
with Rupert Murdoch.

1084
00:56:14.936 --> 00:56:17.112
I remember one time
Beth called me after spending...

1085
00:56:17.156 --> 00:56:19.158
had dinner at Rupert's house
with Wendi.

1086
00:56:19.201 --> 00:56:22.770
She couldn't believe the table
and the table setting.

1087
00:56:24.729 --> 00:56:27.688
They were pulled into a class

1088
00:56:27.732 --> 00:56:31.736
and circle of people
who were way above them.

1089
00:56:32.606 --> 00:56:34.695
So they had
a lot of catching up to do...

1090
00:56:35.174 --> 00:56:36.393
[alarm blaring]

1091
00:56:36.697 --> 00:56:38.395
...because Rupert
was really doing

1092
00:56:38.438 --> 00:56:40.440
what Roger
had pictured himself doing:

1093
00:56:41.441 --> 00:56:43.051
Conquering a new world.

1094
00:56:46.011 --> 00:56:49.014
So Rupert bought
The Wall Street Journal.

1095
00:56:49.754 --> 00:56:52.060
What's the name
of Roger's little newspaper?

1096
00:56:52.626 --> 00:56:54.802
Alexis: The Putnam County
News And Recorder.

1097
00:56:55.107 --> 00:56:57.501
Yeah. The Putnam County
News And Recorder.

1098
00:56:57.544 --> 00:57:00.242
There you go.
That says everything.

1099
00:57:09.426 --> 00:57:12.559
I was actually told about
the sale the night before.

1100
00:57:12.603 --> 00:57:16.607
And I... [scoffs] I think
the first thing I said was

1101
00:57:16.650 --> 00:57:18.260
"Has he seen this?"

1102
00:57:18.478 --> 00:57:20.437
Because it was a one-room

1103
00:57:20.741 --> 00:57:24.310
antiquated equipment.
little dinky thing.

1104
00:57:25.354 --> 00:57:27.182
At that time.
it was a very typical

1105
00:57:27.226 --> 00:57:29.358
sleepy. small-town
weekly newspaper

1106
00:57:29.402 --> 00:57:32.274
that reported on the school
board and the town board.

1107
00:57:32.797 --> 00:57:35.582
And Cold Spring itself
is 1900 people.

1108
00:57:36.496 --> 00:57:38.759
Alison Rooney:
There is definitely
an air of Americana about it.

1109
00:57:38.803 --> 00:57:41.719
It has that main street that's
leading down to the river

1110
00:57:41.762 --> 00:57:43.460
right across from West Point.

1111
00:57:43.851 --> 00:57:45.723
And the whole Cold Spring area

1112
00:57:45.766 --> 00:57:48.334
is steeped
in Revolutionary War history.

1113
00:57:49.727 --> 00:57:52.730
Michael Turton:
The community was shocked
that this media mogul

1114
00:57:52.773 --> 00:57:54.775
this. uh. political kingpin

1115
00:57:54.819 --> 00:57:57.125
would have any interest
in coming to Cold Spring

1116
00:57:57.169 --> 00:57:59.345
and buying
this little weekly newspaper.

1117
00:58:00.564 --> 00:58:02.522
And we thought. you know.
"Is he going to do

1118
00:58:02.566 --> 00:58:05.482
with this local paper
what he does at Fox News?"

1119
00:58:08.833 --> 00:58:12.271

wanted to become

after a meeting.

1128
00:58:45.478 --> 00:58:47.959

I had was

00:58:48.002 --> 00:58:50.875

He was convinced
we were gonna tell him

1132

he couldn't cut trees down.
he couldn't keep his view.

1133

with his attorney.

to the chair. sir?

1142
00:59:37.922 --> 00:59:40.402
Ailes walks up to me. let me
know he owned the newspaper

1143
00:59:40.446 --> 00:59:42.666
let me know he owns the courier
across the county

1144
00:59:42.709 --> 00:59:45.059
and essentially said.
"Look. if I'm not happy

1145

you're not gonna be happy."

1146
00:59:47.801 --> 00:59:50.543

It was like. "Yeah. okay. fine.

You know.
you own a newspaper. Great."

a little naive. [chuckles]

When Roger took over the paper.

to Roger than a battle.

Two minutes. Pass the word.

1178
01:01:30.774 --> 01:01:32.645
He was like John Wayne

1179

leading the Green Berets
through Vietnam.

1180
01:01:35.822 --> 01:01:37.650
And if there was no battle.

1181
01:01:37.694 --> 01:01:39.696
he would create the battle.

1182

with Fox News.

and the liberals.

that we were in a war

01:01:52.883 --> 01:01:56.495
against our way of life.
against evil.

1188
01:01:57.626 --> 01:02:01.065
And he was very moved
by stories of patriotism

1189
01:02:01.108 --> 01:02:02.414
and stories of heroes.

1190
01:02:03.067 --> 01:02:04.198
How is he?

1191
01:02:04.242 --> 01:02:05.896
Pretty bad. sir.
but still alive!

1192
01:02:06.592 --> 01:02:08.072
Alisyn Camerota:
He had hemophilia.

1193
01:02:08.115 --> 01:02:10.857
And he said. "I couldn't serve
in the military

1194
01:02:10.901 --> 01:02:12.946
and that's a big regret
of mine.

1195
01:02:13.425 --> 01:02:15.383
But I consider this

1196
01:02:15.949 --> 01:02:20.040
my... payment to the country.

1197
01:02:20.084 --> 01:02:22.826
And I consider this
my battle station.

1198
01:02:22.869 --> 01:02:24.610
And I'm not leaving
my battle station."

[applauding]

1200
01:02:28.005 --> 01:02:31.269
I'm afraid for our country
and for our children's futures.

1201
01:02:31.530 --> 01:02:34.228
It's just really a scary time
in history.

1202
01:02:34.272 --> 01:02:37.449
This is about the systematic
dismantling of this country.

1203
01:02:37.841 --> 01:02:39.930
People are fired up. They're
upset with the government.

1204
01:02:39.973 --> 01:02:41.322
Have I got that right?

1205
01:02:41.366 --> 01:02:43.760
[cheering]

1206
01:02:44.108 --> 01:02:46.719
Roger Ailes:
Americans love their families.

1207
01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:48.590
They love their flag.

1208
01:02:48.808 --> 01:02:50.549
They think schools
have gone off the edge

1209
01:02:50.592 --> 01:02:52.246
and killed American history.

1210
01:02:53.334 --> 01:02:56.773
I built Fox understanding
the pressures. worries

1211
01:02:56.816 --> 01:02:59.645
and aspirations
of average Americans.

1213
01:03:02.735 --> 01:03:04.432
Roger Ailes:
I love these people.

1214

Vivian:
This is Vivian in Cincinnati

1215
01:03:06.434 --> 01:03:08.567
and. uh. Roger Ailes.
we love you here.

1216
01:03:08.828 --> 01:03:10.656
Keep up the good work.

1217
01:03:10.699 --> 01:03:13.964
female TV viewer:
I want to thank Fox News
for bringing to light

1218
01:03:14.007 --> 01:03:17.141
issues that. uh. don't get
covered by the other networks.

1219
01:03:17.184 --> 01:03:19.186
male TV viewer: Mr. Ailes.
I'm missingFox And Friends

1220
01:03:19.404 --> 01:03:20.884
to see you this morning.

1221
01:03:20.927 --> 01:03:22.624
- Don't do that. [chuckles]
- [male TV viewer laughs]

1222
01:03:22.668 --> 01:03:25.802
We need all the viewers
we can get on Fox And Friends.

1223
01:03:25.845 --> 01:03:28.152
Turn me off immediately
and go to Fox And Friends.

1224
01:03:28.413 --> 01:03:29.501
[laughs]

1225
01:03:30.197 --> 01:03:31.808
E. Jean Carroll: Lots of people
are smarter than Roger Ailes.

1226
01:03:31.851 --> 01:03:35.768
Lots and lots. But nobody
was as canny as Roger.

1227
01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:37.596
He could read a person
very fast.

1228
01:03:37.639 --> 01:03:39.163
He could read a room very fast.

1229
01:03:39.206 --> 01:03:42.470
And. boy. did he get
the temperature of the country

1230
01:03:42.514 --> 01:03:44.603
uh. when nobody else did.

1231
01:03:45.386 --> 01:03:47.954
- That's nice. you see it?
- Oh. wow. that's great.

1232
01:03:47.998 --> 01:03:49.956
And his numbers
have been fantastic.

1233
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.915
Felycia Sugarman:
Roger absolutely understood

1234
01:03:51.958 --> 01:03:55.962
from all the time in politics
that frightening people

1235
01:03:56.006 --> 01:03:59.487
pouring. you know.
gasoline on that fire.

1236
01:03:59.531 --> 01:04:01.838
that gets people
glued to their television.

1237
01:04:03.883 --> 01:04:06.843
Glenn Beck:
That was the genius of Roger

1238
01:04:07.669 --> 01:04:09.367
knowing how to speak

1239
01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:12.022
the language of America.

1240
01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:14.459
More blood. More red meat.

1241
01:04:16.026 --> 01:04:18.680
"I gotta get you outraged.
so you watch more."

1242
01:04:20.204 --> 01:04:22.467
- Caution.
- Listen up. America.

1243
01:04:22.510 --> 01:04:24.338
It is happening. America.

1244
01:04:24.382 --> 01:04:26.645
I am telling you.
America as we know it.

1245
01:04:26.688 --> 01:04:28.690
freedom of speech.
as we know it. is over.

1246
01:04:28.908 --> 01:04:31.693
The left has been preparing
and indoctrinating.

1247
01:04:31.737 --> 01:04:33.826
They're gonna take away
your constitutional rights.

1248
01:04:34.087 --> 01:04:36.176
They sneer at you.
They have contempt for you.

1249
01:04:36.481 --> 01:04:38.744
Who's gonna stop this madness?
You?

1250
01:04:39.527 --> 01:04:41.529
Are you paying attention now?

1251
01:04:42.443 --> 01:04:44.881
When you're watching Fox News.
you think

1252
01:04:45.403 --> 01:04:49.711
these people are just
kind of peddling these theories

1253
01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:52.062
because they want more viewers

1254
01:04:52.105 --> 01:04:54.891
and they're catering
to their base.

1255
01:04:55.587 --> 01:04:57.371
But based on my conversation

1256
01:04:57.415 --> 01:04:59.765
with Roger Ailes.
he truly believed in it.

1257
01:04:59.939 --> 01:05:03.856
Barack Obama has
deep. emotional ties to Islam.

1258
01:05:04.161 --> 01:05:07.294
Lidia Curanaj:
He said to me. "Barack Obama.
he's really not a Christian.

1259
01:05:07.512 --> 01:05:09.862
He's a Muslim.
His father is Muslim.

1260
01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:12.256
Well. he could deny it all he
wants. but he has an agenda."

1261
01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:14.171
Alexis:
What do you think that was?

1262
01:05:14.214 --> 01:05:17.217
To ruin. to ruin America.
To bring it down.

1263
01:05:17.261 --> 01:05:18.915
I mean. that's...
He-He felt like

1264
01:05:18.958 --> 01:05:21.134
the president at the time
was a threat.

1265
01:05:21.787 --> 01:05:23.963
And it was almost like his duty

1266
01:05:24.007 --> 01:05:26.444
as the head of Fox News
to get the truth out.

1267
01:05:27.314 --> 01:05:30.013
Bill O'Reilly:
Barack Obama's father
who abandoned his family

1268
01:05:30.056 --> 01:05:33.277
was a Muslim
who eventually turned atheist.

1269
01:05:33.886 --> 01:05:36.062
male reporter: Barack Obama
has dozens of unelected

1270
01:05:36.106 --> 01:05:39.587
and unaccountable czars working
to execute his radical plan.

1271
01:05:39.631 --> 01:05:41.763
Let's give
his new green jobs czar.

1272
01:05:41.807 --> 01:05:44.941
The guy is. again.
black liberation theology.

1273
01:05:45.115 --> 01:05:46.551
a black nationalist.

1274
01:05:46.768 --> 01:05:49.075
This is part of the movement
that is trying to get Islam

1275
01:05:49.119 --> 01:05:50.947
and specifically. Sharia law

1276
01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:54.298
infused into
the American legal court system.

1277
01:05:54.341 --> 01:05:57.388
This president. I think.
has exposed himself as a guy

1278
01:05:57.431 --> 01:05:59.259
over and over and over again

1279
01:05:59.303 --> 01:06:03.089
who has a deep-seeded hatred
for white people

1280
01:06:03.133 --> 01:06:05.309
or the white culture.
I don't know what it is.

1281
01:06:08.138 --> 01:06:10.053
David Shuster:
Roger Ailes paved the way

1282
01:06:10.096 --> 01:06:13.970
for conspiracy theories
to go mainstream.

1283
01:06:15.058 --> 01:06:18.278
The idea that Barack Obama's
not American

1284
01:06:18.322 --> 01:06:20.367
Pizzagate. whatever it is

1285
01:06:20.585 --> 01:06:23.892
there's no shame now
in promoting this stuff.

1286
01:06:23.936 --> 01:06:27.635
And in fact. the benefit is
you get airtime.

1287
01:06:28.027 --> 01:06:30.334
And if you get airtime.
you become more famous.

1288
01:06:30.377 --> 01:06:32.379
Donald Trump is back here
with us.

1289
01:06:32.597 --> 01:06:34.120
- Thank you.
- Great to have you.

1290
01:06:34.164 --> 01:06:35.600
You are a man of action.

1291
01:06:35.817 --> 01:06:39.473
Trump is such a Foxy character
that if he hadn't been real.

1292
01:06:39.517 --> 01:06:42.824
Roger Ailes would've created
him... [laughs] in a lab.

1293
01:06:42.868 --> 01:06:44.913
Trump: He can say what he wants.
but the fact is

1294
01:06:44.957 --> 01:06:47.177
that this guy has not revealed
his birth certificate.

1295
01:06:47.394 --> 01:06:49.657
He just signs executive orders
all over the place.

1296
01:06:49.701 --> 01:06:51.137
then he'll be sued on that.

1297
01:06:51.181 --> 01:06:52.399
He'll be out on a golf course

1298
01:06:52.617 --> 01:06:54.358
in about three years
when it comes up.

1299
01:06:54.401 --> 01:06:57.970
Everything he touches
turns to trouble.

1300
01:06:58.536 --> 01:07:00.277
And I was gonna use
a worse word.

1301
01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:01.974
but I refuse to use that word.

1302
01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:05.282
Joe Muto: You know. Trump had
a personal relationship

1303
01:07:05.325 --> 01:07:07.501
with a lot of the people
at the network.

1304
01:07:07.545 --> 01:07:10.026
He was on every Fox show.
he was onO'Reilly.

1305
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:12.941
Hannity. Fox And Friends.
He was everywhere.

1306
01:07:12.985 --> 01:07:15.770
Uh. Donald Trump. welcome back.
It's Monday. it's time for you.

1307
01:07:15.814 --> 01:07:17.033
Trump [on phone]:
Good morning.

1308
01:07:17.207 --> 01:07:20.514
So Trump was a familiar voice

1309
01:07:20.558 --> 01:07:22.168
to the Fox News audience.

1310
01:07:22.212 --> 01:07:24.779
which I think
is what made him so palatable

1311
01:07:24.823 --> 01:07:26.912
you know.
during the Republican primary.

1312
01:07:28.392 --> 01:07:30.872
That was Roger's power
and influence.

1313
01:07:30.916 --> 01:07:33.919
[overlapping chatter on TV]

1314
01:07:38.924 --> 01:07:42.406
John Cook:
Roger Ailes is one of
the most consequential figures

1315
01:07:42.449 --> 01:07:44.930
in our cultural history.

1316
01:07:46.149 --> 01:07:49.500
And at a time when
the news business as a whole

1317
01:07:49.543 --> 01:07:51.110
was. like. dying and flailing.

1318
01:07:51.937 --> 01:07:54.113
he created one
of the most profitable

1319
01:07:54.461 --> 01:07:56.289
news ventures ever.

1320
01:07:58.335 --> 01:08:01.555
Alisyn Camerota:
He figured out that there was
this right-leaning market

1321
01:08:01.599 --> 01:08:03.340
that hadn't been cornered.

1322
01:08:03.383 --> 01:08:05.777
It aligned
with his own world view.

1323
01:08:06.299 --> 01:08:07.866
And in a short order. Fox News

1324
01:08:07.909 --> 01:08:09.824
became the number one
cable network.

1325
01:08:09.868 --> 01:08:12.262
Our cable news competition
has been destroyed.

1326
01:08:12.305 --> 01:08:14.699
Ratings for liberal TV news
are dismal.

1327
01:08:14.916 --> 01:08:17.919

Fox News Channel remained
the top cable news channel...

1328
01:08:17.963 --> 01:08:20.792
Alisyn Camerota:
And then all of his assumptions
have been proven right.

1329
01:08:20.966 --> 01:08:23.099
female anchor #5:
Ailes has signed
a new multi-year contract

1330
01:08:23.273 --> 01:08:24.361
with the company.

1331
01:08:24.404 --> 01:08:27.103
I mean. he was winning.
He was winning.

[train horn blaring]

1333
01:08:35.807 --> 01:08:38.636
I think when you look at
Roger Ailes in this community.

1334
01:08:39.158 --> 01:08:40.507
he tried to take it over.

1335
01:08:40.812 --> 01:08:42.422
but never really
became part of it.

1336
01:08:43.989 --> 01:08:46.948
And he may have been a genius
on the national scene.

1337
01:08:46.992 --> 01:08:49.212
but I think
he really did not get

1338
01:08:49.255 --> 01:08:51.257
what the local community was.

1339
01:08:53.651 --> 01:08:56.132
Roger Ailes: I moved up
to that quiet village.

1340
01:08:56.175 --> 01:08:59.004
but I had no idea there was
any intrigue up there.

1341
01:08:59.396 --> 01:09:02.660
I thought this was a normal.
nice community.

1342
01:09:04.183 --> 01:09:06.794
All of a sudden.
we find out. holy shit!

1343
01:09:06.838 --> 01:09:09.928
Reminds me of
the La Drang Valley in Vietnam.

1344
01:09:12.496 --> 01:09:15.586
Alison Rooney:
Working at the newspaper
with Roger and Beth.

1345
01:09:15.629 --> 01:09:18.284
it was always thinking
the worst of people.

1346
01:09:18.328 --> 01:09:21.026
always thinking that
someone was out to get them.

1347
01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:24.856
They relished
rousing and dividing.

1348
01:09:25.813 --> 01:09:28.990
And I just decided
I just can't take it anymore.

1349
01:09:30.296 --> 01:09:31.515
Got to get out.

1350
01:09:35.867 --> 01:09:38.696
A great number of people
in their staff left.

1351
01:09:39.697 --> 01:09:42.526
You know. it was sizable.
It was. you know. at least 50%.

1352
01:09:43.570 --> 01:09:46.704
And we all knew that they would
perceive it as an attack.

1353
01:09:52.057 --> 01:09:54.190
About three days
after I left there.

1354
01:09:54.712 --> 01:09:58.194
I began hearing from people

1355
01:09:58.237 --> 01:10:00.152
whom I had sent Facebook
messages to.

1356
01:10:00.370 --> 01:10:02.850
private Facebook messages
from my own account.

1357
01:10:03.416 --> 01:10:07.159
um. that... that they knew

1358
01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:09.379
that Roger Ailes
had looked at them.

1359
01:10:10.423 --> 01:10:14.297
And in one instance. the person
received a phone call

1360
01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:15.559
from Roger Ailes.

1361
01:10:16.168 --> 01:10:19.258
He picked up he said.
"This is Roger Ailes.

1362
01:10:19.302 --> 01:10:22.566
I hear that you've been making.
uh. threats about me."

1363
01:10:23.393 --> 01:10:27.353
And he quoted whatever
innocuous throwaway line.

1364
01:10:27.397 --> 01:10:30.400
He quoted verbatim
from my personal accounts.

1365
01:10:30.748 --> 01:10:33.925
All password protected.
signed into by me.

1366
01:10:35.274 --> 01:10:37.363
And it was
absolutely terrifying.

1367
01:10:38.843 --> 01:10:41.019
This feeling that there are
really powerful people

1368
01:10:41.062 --> 01:10:43.282
who live five minutes
from my door

1369
01:10:43.326 --> 01:10:45.632
who are out to destroy me
and my little life.

1370
01:10:47.721 --> 01:10:49.419
But I was just the copy editor.

1371
01:10:49.941 --> 01:10:51.769
Like. why does he care?

1372
01:10:55.773 --> 01:10:59.646
Richard Shea:
You know. during the election.
it got so ugly.

1373
01:10:59.907 --> 01:11:01.387
I remember at one point.
he said.

1374
01:11:01.431 --> 01:11:03.563
"I'll park a goddamn
Fox News truck

1375
01:11:03.607 --> 01:11:06.262
at the end of your driveway
and have them follow you

1376
01:11:06.305 --> 01:11:07.567
as long as I want."

1377
01:11:08.351 --> 01:11:09.874
And that's not the kind of thing

1378
01:11:09.917 --> 01:11:12.268
that you're expecting
in small-town politics.

1379
01:11:13.965 --> 01:11:16.402
You know. they put our house
on the front page

1380
01:11:16.446 --> 01:11:17.621
ofThe Putnam County News.

1381
01:11:18.839 --> 01:11:21.973
And. you know. I was getting
letters about abortion.

1382
01:11:23.279 --> 01:11:25.324
Then one guy told me
point-blank one time.

1383
01:11:25.368 --> 01:11:27.500
"If I ever see you cross
the street. I'll run you over."

1384
01:11:27.805 --> 01:11:31.809
And I was like.
"Man. this is nuts."

1385
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:41.949
But in the end.
the election wasn't close.

1386
01:11:41.993 --> 01:11:43.516
Not within 50%.

1387
01:11:43.821 --> 01:11:46.127
[chuckles] We're here
at Makaria Gallagher's house

1388
01:11:46.171 --> 01:11:47.912
celebrating a Democratic sweep.

1389
01:11:47.955 --> 01:11:50.567
The opposition's here. We've all
shook hands and made up.

1390
01:11:50.610 --> 01:11:52.612
So we're looking forward
to working for the town

1391
01:11:52.656 --> 01:11:54.701
and. you know. getting things
back to normal.

1392
01:11:59.010 --> 01:12:00.490
After winning the election.

1393
01:12:01.012 --> 01:12:03.144
we spent many.
many hours together.

1394
01:12:03.188 --> 01:12:04.929
He'd call me on
a lot of Fridays.

1395
01:12:04.972 --> 01:12:06.496
"Come on down.
I wanna talk to you."

1396
01:12:06.539 --> 01:12:07.801
You know. Friday afternoon.

1397
01:12:08.019 --> 01:12:09.977
It would be about local issues
and then it would

1398
01:12:10.021 --> 01:12:13.024
just morph into him
telling me about himself.

1399
01:12:13.372 --> 01:12:14.939
Trying to impress me.

1400
01:12:15.156 --> 01:12:17.158
He would always tell me
how much money he made.

1401
01:12:17.202 --> 01:12:20.379
You know. he just made a billion
dollars last year for Fox.

1402
01:12:20.423 --> 01:12:22.076
It was sad in a way.
I'm thinking

1403
01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:24.340
"Here's a guy.
all the money in the world.

1404
01:12:24.383 --> 01:12:26.733
could be anywhere.
be doing anything.

1405
01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:28.779
and we're sitting
in the offices

1406
01:12:28.822 --> 01:12:31.216
of The Putnam County News
having a chat.

1407
01:12:32.260 --> 01:12:35.873
I always wondered. "Does
this guy have actual friends?"

1408
01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:40.399
You know. "Don't you have
somewhere you'd rather be?"

1409
01:12:45.230 --> 01:12:46.971
He would come right out and say.

1410
01:12:47.014 --> 01:12:49.234
"Why do people hate me
so much here?"

1411
01:12:56.894 --> 01:13:03.814
Roger Ailes:

1412
01:13:07.513 --> 01:13:10.211
Keep your eyes on other people.
Watch what's going on.

1413
01:13:11.561 --> 01:13:14.912
Are they agreeing with you
or disagreeing?

1414
01:13:18.481 --> 01:13:21.353
I was told. my first week
on the job.

1415
01:13:21.919 --> 01:13:23.399
"Roger has this place bugged.

1416
01:13:24.661 --> 01:13:27.446
He's got the newsroom bugged.
He's got the elevators bugged.

1417
01:13:27.490 --> 01:13:30.275
He's got
all the talent offices bugged.

1418
01:13:30.667 --> 01:13:32.364
Don't talk shit about Roger.

1419
01:13:33.104 --> 01:13:34.497
Don't talk about. you know.

1420
01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:36.237
how much you love
Hillary Clinton

1421
01:13:36.281 --> 01:13:39.023
because they'll fire you if they
hear you talking like that."

1422
01:13:42.418 --> 01:13:46.160
Glenn Beck:
At one point. he called me
into his office and he said.

1423
01:13:46.204 --> 01:13:50.164
"You know. a lot of people
doing their homework on you."

1424
01:13:50.208 --> 01:13:51.470
I said. "I know."

1425
01:13:51.818 --> 01:13:54.691
And he said.
"So you have to be careful."

1426
01:13:54.734 --> 01:13:57.433
And I said. "Hmm. I know."

1427
01:13:58.216 --> 01:13:59.609
And he said.

1428
01:13:59.652 --> 01:14:03.961
"Look. there's a lot of stuff
out there."

1429
01:14:04.309 --> 01:14:07.573
And he reaches down and he pulls
up a stack of file folders

1430
01:14:07.617 --> 01:14:09.401
about this tall. literally.

1431
01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:11.795
He sits it right in front of him

1432
01:14:12.404 --> 01:14:14.101
and he just puts his hand
on there.

1433
01:14:14.624 --> 01:14:17.931
And he said... He sits there
and he looks at me for a while

1434
01:14:17.975 --> 01:14:19.150
and he said.

1435
01:14:20.586 --> 01:14:22.458
"It's always a shame

1436
01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:26.940
when a man has a wife
as wonderful as yours."

1437
01:14:27.767 --> 01:14:29.552
I was like. Oh. my gosh.

1438
01:14:29.595 --> 01:14:32.468
And I leaned up out of my chair
towards his desk

1439
01:14:32.511 --> 01:14:34.861
and I said. "Yes?"

1440
01:14:35.253 --> 01:14:37.429
And he said.
"It's always a shame

1441
01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:40.301
when a man does something
to hurt that woman."

1442
01:14:40.345 --> 01:14:42.521
And I said. "It is.

1443
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:47.613
and that's why I'm happy to say
nothing like that has happened."

1444
01:14:47.874 --> 01:14:50.529
And he stared at me
for about 30 seconds

1445
01:14:50.573 --> 01:14:53.358
and he put the files down.
and he said.

1446
01:14:53.924 --> 01:14:55.403
"But I just want you
to be careful."

1447
01:14:55.447 --> 01:14:58.494
He was fishing for something.

1448
01:14:59.625 --> 01:15:00.887
He was bluffing.

1449
01:15:01.105 --> 01:15:03.020
I think there was nothing
in those files.

1450
01:15:04.717 --> 01:15:09.374
That was Roger's way
of having control of people.

1451
01:15:11.202 --> 01:15:14.771
First thing I tell people at Fox
is. if you're not happy here

1452
01:15:14.814 --> 01:15:18.035
and you're not havin' fun here.
you need to get out of here

1453
01:15:18.949 --> 01:15:21.038
because we don't wanna be
around downers.

1454
01:15:22.082 --> 01:15:27.044
Negative people make
positive people physically ill.

1455
01:15:29.133 --> 01:15:33.180
All progress
depends on positive people.

1456
01:15:36.009 --> 01:15:39.404
Get away from the other ones.
They're gonna drag you down.

1457
01:15:42.668 --> 01:15:45.541
I was offered. um.
on three occasions

1458
01:15:45.584 --> 01:15:47.194
to go and work at Fox

1459
01:15:47.804 --> 01:15:50.241
and I turned them all down.

1460
01:15:50.763 --> 01:15:53.026
I think Roger
was a different person then.

1461
01:15:53.070 --> 01:15:57.422
And it wasn't a place
that I wanted to work.

1462
01:15:58.118 --> 01:16:01.687
And it's sad to me that
he went on to do what he did.

1463
01:16:02.079 --> 01:16:04.951
I think he probably
would have been happier

1464
01:16:05.604 --> 01:16:09.347
if America's Talkingcontinued.

1465
01:16:12.089 --> 01:16:16.049
Felycia Sugarman:
When I went up to visit him at
Fox. he seemed happy to see me.

1466
01:16:16.093 --> 01:16:18.225
I mean. he was married.
He had a son.

1467
01:16:18.269 --> 01:16:20.967
He talked a lot about his son.
Zach. when I saw him.

1468
01:16:21.794 --> 01:16:25.363
But I remember thinking
it was a little bit odd

1469
01:16:25.406 --> 01:16:27.495
because he had
the bulletproof glass.

1470
01:16:27.539 --> 01:16:30.063
the cameras that were feeding
into his office.

1471
01:16:30.107 --> 01:16:32.892
There was a steel
or some kind of reinforced door.

1472
01:16:32.936 --> 01:16:36.330
And he said that he's. you know.
had to protect himself

1473
01:16:36.374 --> 01:16:38.289
against the Libyans
or something.

1474
01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:43.424
Adasa Blanco:
Mr. Ailes wasn't favorable

1475
01:16:43.468 --> 01:16:46.253
towards people
of Middle-Eastern descent.

1476
01:16:47.298 --> 01:16:50.475
He kinda had these
preconceived ideas of them.

1477
01:16:52.303 --> 01:16:55.741
And there was one incident.
a horrible incident

1478
01:16:55.785 --> 01:16:58.788
that a coworker of mine. Musfik

1479
01:16:58.831 --> 01:17:01.921
he had to bring something
to the second floor

1480
01:17:01.965 --> 01:17:05.490
and wound up in Mr. Ailes area.

1481
01:17:06.186 --> 01:17:07.623
and all hell broke loose.

1482
01:17:08.972 --> 01:17:11.104
Next thing you know.
there was a wall built

1483
01:17:11.148 --> 01:17:15.108
so you had to go through a door
to get into his area.

1484
01:17:16.327 --> 01:17:18.982
And Musfik was upset.
He was in tears.

1485
01:17:19.417 --> 01:17:22.028
They revoked his access.
not to Mr. Ailes' area.

1486
01:17:22.246 --> 01:17:24.248
but to the second floor
entirely.

1487
01:17:27.468 --> 01:17:30.646
John Cook: Roger Ailes was
a profoundly paranoid person.

1488
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:33.474
He carried a gun at all times.

1489
01:17:33.518 --> 01:17:36.129
He was convinced that Al-Qaeda
was trying to kill him.

1490
01:17:36.173 --> 01:17:39.176
that gay terrorists
would come attack him.

1491
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:42.048
Um. Roger Ailes thought
that like

1492
01:17:42.527 --> 01:17:47.314
Osama Bin Laden was sitting
in his cave

1493
01:17:47.358 --> 01:17:49.621
and he had. like.
the list of people.

1494
01:17:49.665 --> 01:17:51.841
And it was like.
George W. Bush.

1495
01:17:52.842 --> 01:17:53.973
and then Roger Ailes.

1496
01:17:55.018 --> 01:17:57.934
He thought that he was
a world historical figure

1497
01:17:57.977 --> 01:17:59.805
worthy of
an assassination attempt.

1498
01:18:05.855 --> 01:18:07.857
[piano music plays]

1499
01:18:09.859 --> 01:18:11.817
Alisyn Camerota:
At the White House
Christmas party

1500
01:18:11.861 --> 01:18:13.689
I was directly behind Roger

1501
01:18:13.863 --> 01:18:17.214
in line to have our photos taken
with the president.

1502
01:18:17.649 --> 01:18:20.173
So I peeked around the curtain

1503
01:18:20.217 --> 01:18:23.699
and I watched
as Roger Ailes approached

1504
01:18:23.742 --> 01:18:26.353
and Barack Obama turned around
and held his arms out.

1505
01:18:26.397 --> 01:18:29.705
and saw Roger for the first time
and said.

1506
01:18:30.053 --> 01:18:34.013
"Roger Ailes.
the most powerful man in media.

1507
01:18:34.057 --> 01:18:35.580
step right up."

1508
01:18:36.450 --> 01:18:38.757
And Roger went up
and shook his hand

1509
01:18:38.801 --> 01:18:41.847
and they stood
and smiled for the camera

1510
01:18:41.891 --> 01:18:43.240
and took the shot.

1511
01:18:44.458 --> 01:18:47.374
I didn't know if they were
gonna insult each other

1512
01:18:47.418 --> 01:18:49.202
or. like. come to blows

1513
01:18:49.246 --> 01:18:53.424
because it had been so tense
for so long.

1514
01:18:54.251 --> 01:18:58.211
And so when we got back
the next day. I was back at Fox

1515
01:18:58.255 --> 01:19:01.562
and I ran into one of the
senior vice presidents who said.

1516
01:19:01.606 --> 01:19:03.390
"Did you have fun
at the Christmas party?"

1517
01:19:03.434 --> 01:19:05.392
I said. "I had a great time.
It was fascinating

1518
01:19:05.436 --> 01:19:09.005
because I was right behind Roger
for the photo taking."

1519
01:19:09.048 --> 01:19:11.703
He said. "Oh. then you heard
the big moment?"

1520
01:19:11.747 --> 01:19:14.837
And I said. "Yes. I did."
And he said. "Wasn't it crazy

1521
01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:17.840
to hear President Obama say.

1522
01:19:17.883 --> 01:19:21.278
'Roger Ailes. the most
powerful man in the world'?"

1523
01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:24.585
And I said.
"That's not what he said."

1524
01:19:24.629 --> 01:19:27.632
And he said. "Yes. it is."
And I said. "Uh-uh."

1525
01:19:28.415 --> 01:19:31.157
He said. "Roger Ailes.
the most powerful man in media."

1526
01:19:31.549 --> 01:19:34.247
But there was no point
in me going to. like. burst

1527
01:19:34.291 --> 01:19:37.903
Roger's bubble
or call bullshit on it with him

1528
01:19:37.947 --> 01:19:39.818
you know. one-on-one.
because I saw that

1529
01:19:39.862 --> 01:19:42.386
that was already
the new narrative.

1530
01:19:55.660 --> 01:19:58.837
Sarah Ellison:
Roger was definitely invested
in creating a myth

1531
01:19:58.881 --> 01:20:01.405
about who he was
and what he had come from.

1532
01:20:02.014 --> 01:20:04.843
And it was a myth
about overcoming adversity.

1533
01:20:04.887 --> 01:20:08.325
It was a myth about success.
It was a myth about power.

1534
01:20:10.327 --> 01:20:12.851
For example. the story of Roger
jumping to his father

1535
01:20:12.895 --> 01:20:16.768
and then being allowed
to fall flat on the ground

1536
01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:20.163
is such a well-known
literary trope.

1537
01:20:20.206 --> 01:20:22.992
The story of how
a father teaches his son

1538
01:20:23.035 --> 01:20:25.516
the hard lessons of life.

1539
01:20:26.212 --> 01:20:29.172
It's been used in literature
many. many times.

1540
01:20:30.521 --> 01:20:33.219
And the story happens
in the bedroom

1541
01:20:33.437 --> 01:20:35.308
he shares with his brother.

1542
01:20:35.352 --> 01:20:38.703
His brother denies
that that story is true.

1543
01:20:39.051 --> 01:20:43.099
But I think
it's Roger's effort to create

1544
01:20:43.142 --> 01:20:47.190
a kind of trust-no-one
victim narrative

1545
01:20:47.233 --> 01:20:48.844
that really fueled him.

1546
01:20:49.888 --> 01:20:52.195
and Roger really knew
how to manipulate that.

1547
01:20:57.722 --> 01:21:01.334
Glenn Beck:
It's hard when you actually
believe in something

1548
01:21:01.378 --> 01:21:04.250
and you.
you don't want to do harm.

1549
01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:07.732
but somehow or another.
you just keep doing harm.

1550
01:21:08.559 --> 01:21:12.041
announcer: Ladies and gentlemen.
Glenn Beck!

1551
01:21:12.650 --> 01:21:14.695
Hello. America!

1552
01:21:16.872 --> 01:21:18.874
I remember
when I was in Washington D.C.

1553
01:21:19.439 --> 01:21:21.224
It was after the big thing
on the mall.

1554
01:21:22.094 --> 01:21:24.792
And I remember
praying and hearing

1555
01:21:24.836 --> 01:21:26.664
"You're standing
in the wrong place."

1556
01:21:26.707 --> 01:21:28.492
We are truly humbled..

1557
01:21:28.535 --> 01:21:30.886
How am I now in this position

1558
01:21:31.103 --> 01:21:32.844
where I am the most polarizing

1559
01:21:32.888 --> 01:21:35.412
divisive figure in the country?

1560
01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:39.938
And it was the beginning
of give it all up.

1561
01:21:39.982 --> 01:21:42.071
Get out. get out.
get out. get out.

1562
01:21:44.073 --> 01:21:46.553
So I went into Roger's office
and I said. "I'm leaving."

1563
01:21:46.597 --> 01:21:48.251
And he said. "No. you're not.
Nobody leaves."

1564
01:21:48.294 --> 01:21:50.862
And I said. "Yeah. you know
what. before you say anything...

1565
01:21:52.603 --> 01:21:54.039
can I just say something

1566
01:21:54.083 --> 01:21:57.956
'cause I know
how this is gonna end here?

1567
01:21:58.217 --> 01:22:00.045
So just let me say this to you.

1568
01:22:00.089 --> 01:22:02.918
No matter what. thank you."

1569
01:22:03.788 --> 01:22:06.878
I said. "Thank you
for giving the conservatives

1570
01:22:07.096 --> 01:22:09.533
a chance to have a voice."

1571
01:22:10.577 --> 01:22:14.407
And I... And he looked at me
and his eyes welled up.

1572
01:22:14.451 --> 01:22:17.062
And that meant something to him

1573
01:22:17.106 --> 01:22:20.631
that somebody actually saw it
that way.

1574
01:22:23.286 --> 01:22:24.591
I said to Roger.

1575
01:22:24.896 --> 01:22:27.333
"So what are you.
what's next for you?"

1576
01:22:27.551 --> 01:22:29.248
I said.
"Why are you still here?"

1577
01:22:29.988 --> 01:22:34.732
And he said. "Still have a.
still have a president to pick."

1578
01:22:37.561 --> 01:22:40.825
"I still have a president
to pick."

1579
01:22:42.261 --> 01:22:43.349
Wow.

1580
01:22:48.964 --> 01:22:50.617
Roger Ailes:
We're in a storm.

1581
01:22:50.661 --> 01:22:53.011
Our mast is broken.
our compass is off

1582
01:22:53.055 --> 01:22:55.144
and there's a big damn hole
in the boat.

1583
01:22:56.710 --> 01:23:00.366
We've allowed ourselves
to be manipulated by others.

1584
01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:05.981
Is everything fair game today?

1585
01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:08.505
Is everything personal?

1586
01:23:15.512 --> 01:23:19.037
A sexual harassment scandal is
rocking the world of cable news.

1587
01:23:19.081 --> 01:23:20.952
Gretchen Carlson.
who until recently

1588
01:23:20.996 --> 01:23:22.475
was an anchor for Fox News

1589
01:23:22.519 --> 01:23:26.305
is suing the channel's
powerful CEO. Roger Ailes.

1590
01:23:26.349 --> 01:23:28.133
She accuses him of firing her

1591
01:23:28.177 --> 01:23:30.353
for refusing
his sexual advances.

1592
01:23:31.223 --> 01:23:33.704
Gretchen Carlson
was a former Miss America.

1593
01:23:34.052 --> 01:23:36.315
female announcer:
She's crying. that's obligatory.

1594
01:23:36.359 --> 01:23:39.405
Sarah Ellison:
She was a violin prodigy
and had used those talents

1595
01:23:39.623 --> 01:23:41.625
to get her
a Miss America crown.

1596
01:23:42.843 --> 01:23:45.890
But she also
had a kind of hard edge

1597
01:23:46.238 --> 01:23:48.066
and she was sophisticated

1598
01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:51.852
even though when she was on air
onFox And Friends.

1599
01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:53.593
she sort of played dumb.

1600
01:23:53.637 --> 01:23:55.987
We're not supposed to wear
the same color and I'm just..

1601
01:23:56.031 --> 01:23:58.946
- Just one of those mornings.
- [laughs] No kiddin'.

1602
01:23:58.990 --> 01:24:01.166
But she certainly
went into this prepared.

1603
01:24:01.210 --> 01:24:05.214
She had been recording
conversations with Roger

1604
01:24:05.562 --> 01:24:08.434
long before
her contract wasn't renewed.

1605
01:24:08.652 --> 01:24:11.524
female anchor:
She accused him
of ogling her in his office

1606
01:24:11.568 --> 01:24:15.528
and asking her to turn around
so he could view her posterior

1607
01:24:15.572 --> 01:24:17.095
claiming Ailes told her:

1608
01:24:28.933 --> 01:24:31.675
Sarah Ellison: There is a way
to operate in a crisis.

1609
01:24:31.936 --> 01:24:33.894
And there are
a group of professionals

1610
01:24:33.938 --> 01:24:35.896
who know how to do that.

1611
01:24:37.463 --> 01:24:40.118
When Roger is being accused
of sexual harassment

1612
01:24:40.162 --> 01:24:44.209
and needs to know
who he should hire

1613
01:24:44.253 --> 01:24:46.603
and who he should go to
for advice

1614
01:24:47.125 --> 01:24:49.475
who does he call
but Donald Trump?

1615
01:24:55.133 --> 01:24:56.482
Let me check your mic.

1616
01:24:58.441 --> 01:25:02.575
We operate in a very small space
called Crisis Communications.

1617
01:25:02.619 --> 01:25:04.751
but with clients that find
themselves. we always say

1618
01:25:04.795 --> 01:25:07.014
in difficult
or delicate situations.

1619
01:25:07.058 --> 01:25:09.930
So we get a lot of our work
through attorneys.

1620
01:25:12.585 --> 01:25:16.285
Karen Kessler: The day after
Gretchen's lawsuit was filed

1621
01:25:16.502 --> 01:25:18.374
I was on my way home
from the gym.

1622
01:25:18.417 --> 01:25:20.158
and it was about 7:30
in the morning.

1623
01:25:20.202 --> 01:25:22.117
and the phone rang.

1624
01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:25.424
and it was an attorney
that is a well-known litigator.

1625
01:25:25.468 --> 01:25:28.862
He said. "I work with
Donald Trump a great deal.

1626
01:25:28.906 --> 01:25:30.777
"Donald Trump
is looking to find someone

1627
01:25:30.821 --> 01:25:32.605
who can help his friend.
Roger Ailes."

1628
01:25:34.433 --> 01:25:35.956
And at that point.
we did not know

1629
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.785
much about Roger's history
with women.

1630
01:25:38.829 --> 01:25:42.441
and we walked in with the belief
that this was a legal case

1631
01:25:42.485 --> 01:25:45.183
and that they were gonna be
fighting it on the legal merits.

1632
01:25:46.967 --> 01:25:49.274
We pulled in
and we were greeted by a woman

1633
01:25:49.318 --> 01:25:52.625
who introduced herself
as Beth Ailes' sister.

1634
01:25:52.669 --> 01:25:55.106
And she took us
into the living room.

1635
01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:59.328
which was very heavy chintz:
florals. sofas.

1636
01:25:59.371 --> 01:26:02.766
And seated against the windows
in this huge armchair

1637
01:26:02.809 --> 01:26:05.116
was Roger himself.
larger than life

1638
01:26:05.377 --> 01:26:09.555
hooked up
to an intravenous... bag

1639
01:26:09.816 --> 01:26:14.169
uh. attached to one of those
long. those high metal stands.

1640
01:26:14.212 --> 01:26:17.694
And Beth said.
"Roger is getting his vitamins."

1641
01:26:18.347 --> 01:26:22.612
There was this whirlwind going
on around him and about him.

1642
01:26:22.655 --> 01:26:27.182
It was just this frenetic kind
of energy war room-like.

1643
01:26:27.356 --> 01:26:30.185
of phones ringing
people walking in and out.

1644
01:26:30.402 --> 01:26:32.491
You know. "I just heard
from Alan Dershowitz."

1645
01:26:32.535 --> 01:26:35.146
"Oh. that's so-and-so's
weighing in."

1646
01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:38.541
"I need to get on the phone.
Rudy Giuliani just called me."

1647
01:26:38.584 --> 01:26:41.239
Everybody was a guardian
at the gate

1648
01:26:41.283 --> 01:26:42.675
to protect Roger.

1649
01:26:42.719 --> 01:26:46.201
And I...
He really responded

1650
01:26:46.592 --> 01:26:48.507
I think. very well to that.

1651
01:26:48.551 --> 01:26:52.642
Which is one of the reasons
why it offended him

1652
01:26:52.685 --> 01:26:57.255
that Gretchen Carlson
had. uh. had sued him.

1653
01:26:57.299 --> 01:26:59.997
"This no-good. just sort
of a talentless reporter."

1654
01:27:00.258 --> 01:27:03.218
He said that really the lawsuit

1655
01:27:03.261 --> 01:27:05.568
wasn't about the money.

1656
01:27:05.611 --> 01:27:07.918
It was about getting attention.

1657
01:27:08.223 --> 01:27:11.878
And that she was desperate
to be on television.

1658
01:27:11.922 --> 01:27:15.012
And without being on television.
she had no reason to live.

1659
01:27:15.273 --> 01:27:18.363
And I said. "You know.
in the end. all these cases

1660
01:27:18.407 --> 01:27:21.975
usually settle because it's not
worth the negative publicity

1661
01:27:22.019 --> 01:27:23.760
and it's not worth
the career impact."

1662
01:27:24.021 --> 01:27:26.893
And when I said that. Beth Ailes
jumped out of her chair

1663
01:27:26.937 --> 01:27:29.896
furious. and she said.
with this look in her eyes.

1664
01:27:29.940 --> 01:27:33.030
"We will never ever
settle this case."

1665
01:27:33.813 --> 01:27:35.380
And she looked at us and said.

1666
01:27:35.424 --> 01:27:37.252
"You need
to understand something.

1667
01:27:37.295 --> 01:27:40.472
Roger is more important
than America."

1668
01:27:41.081 --> 01:27:42.909
I looked at Warren
and I looked at his pad

1669
01:27:42.953 --> 01:27:45.390
'cause Warren was taking notes.
and Warren said.

1670
01:27:45.434 --> 01:27:49.307
"I'm writing it down. Roger is
more important than America."

1671
01:27:54.791 --> 01:27:56.575
Shepard Smith:
Fox News chairman. Roger Ailes.

1672
01:27:56.793 --> 01:27:59.186
is responding
to a lawsuit filed by lawyers

1673
01:27:59.230 --> 01:28:00.753
for Gretchen Carlson

1674
01:28:00.797 --> 01:28:04.279
calling her accusations or
allegations false and offensive.

1675
01:28:04.453 --> 01:28:08.761
They said all statements will
be run through Irena Briganti.

1676
01:28:09.066 --> 01:28:11.590
the head of public relations
for Fox.

1677
01:28:11.634 --> 01:28:14.680
who he told us
was a stone killer.

1678
01:28:15.159 --> 01:28:17.335
And she was intensely focused

1679
01:28:17.379 --> 01:28:19.946
on getting
as many of the highest profile

1680
01:28:19.990 --> 01:28:23.210
and frankly.
best-looking women on Fox

1681
01:28:23.254 --> 01:28:25.648
to say that indeed
he was not a harasser.

1682
01:28:25.909 --> 01:28:27.867
And Irena was really proud
that in one day

1683
01:28:27.911 --> 01:28:30.435
she had been able to enlist
22 people to say--

1684
01:28:30.479 --> 01:28:32.263
- "We're up to 22."
- Right.

1685
01:28:32.307 --> 01:28:33.525
"We're up to 22. Roger."

1686
01:28:34.396 --> 01:28:37.573
female ABC anchor:
Several female Fox anchors
are coming to his defense

1687
01:28:37.616 --> 01:28:39.662
including Maria Bartiromo
who says:

1688
01:28:45.145 --> 01:28:48.192
Donald Trump:
It's very sad because
he's a very good person.

1689
01:28:48.584 --> 01:28:52.327
And I can tell you that some
of the women complaining

1690
01:28:52.370 --> 01:28:54.024
I-I know how much
he's helped them.

1691
01:28:55.417 --> 01:28:58.811
Sarah Ellison:
Beth called Kimberly Guilfoyle
who was one of the anchors

1692
01:28:58.855 --> 01:29:00.987
at something like 6:30
in the morning

1693
01:29:01.031 --> 01:29:02.815
the day
after the suit was filed.

1694
01:29:03.207 --> 01:29:05.818
The idea was to get Kimberly

1695
01:29:06.428 --> 01:29:10.736
to read a statement
of support on air

1696
01:29:10.954 --> 01:29:13.739
while a group of Fox News women

1697
01:29:13.957 --> 01:29:17.830
walked in behind her and formed
a sort of semi-circle behind her

1698
01:29:17.874 --> 01:29:20.180
as a show of support for him.

1699
01:29:21.225 --> 01:29:24.489
Karen Kessler:
They had a whole strategy.
and the more we pushed back

1700
01:29:24.533 --> 01:29:27.536
Irena would say things like.
"Stand down!"

1701
01:29:29.494 --> 01:29:32.671
So here's the deal. If somebody
is paying you a wage.

1702
01:29:32.715 --> 01:29:35.282
you owe that person
or company allegiance.

1703
01:29:35.326 --> 01:29:37.197
If you don't like what's
happening in the workplace.

1704
01:29:37.241 --> 01:29:39.504
go to Human Resources or leave.

1705
01:29:39.548 --> 01:29:41.985
But don't run down the concern
that supports you

1706
01:29:42.028 --> 01:29:43.856
by trying to undermine it.

1707
01:29:43.900 --> 01:29:46.381
Factor tip of the day.
loyalty is good.

1708
01:29:47.904 --> 01:29:49.384
reporter:
Mr. Ailes...

1709
01:29:49.427 --> 01:29:51.037
[indistinct chatter]

1710
01:29:51.429 --> 01:29:53.692
male CNN anchor:
Fox is Ailes' fiefdom.

1711
01:29:53.736 --> 01:29:56.478
But even he has a boss.
three bosses actually.

1712
01:29:56.521 --> 01:29:58.393
Rupert Murdoch
and his two sons.

1713
01:29:58.436 --> 01:30:00.743
And the Murdochs
are now involved.

1714
01:30:03.485 --> 01:30:05.922
Sarah Ellison:
Rupert had always
protected Roger.

1715
01:30:06.618 --> 01:30:09.404
But this time it was different
because Rupert's sons

1716
01:30:09.447 --> 01:30:12.885
James and Lachlan Murdoch.
who had never liked Roger.

1717
01:30:12.929 --> 01:30:14.887
Roger never liked them.

1718
01:30:14.931 --> 01:30:17.542
had decided to hire
an outside law firm

1719
01:30:17.586 --> 01:30:20.545
to investigate the claims
against Roger.

1720
01:30:23.026 --> 01:30:24.897
Karen Kessler:
He was so dismissive.

1721
01:30:25.855 --> 01:30:29.467
He really believed that as
annoying as these two kids were

1722
01:30:29.946 --> 01:30:31.904
you know.
he could flick them off.

1723
01:30:31.948 --> 01:30:34.429
And that's really why
he had to defend this lawsuit

1724
01:30:34.472 --> 01:30:36.692
so that they didn't use this
as the weapon

1725
01:30:36.735 --> 01:30:38.128
that they were looking for.

1726
01:30:40.609 --> 01:30:43.438
He told us
that most of the talent at Fox

1727
01:30:43.481 --> 01:30:46.484
had in their contract
that they had the right to walk

1728
01:30:46.528 --> 01:30:48.094
if anything were to happen
to him

1729
01:30:48.138 --> 01:30:50.227
and he were to have to leave.

1730
01:30:50.270 --> 01:30:52.751
And so he was really intent
on showing

1731
01:30:52.795 --> 01:30:56.842
that almost every notable name
on Fox was gonna leave with him.

1732
01:30:57.234 --> 01:30:59.454
Who with any kind
of fiduciary responsibility

1733
01:30:59.497 --> 01:31:00.933
allows that to happen?

1734
01:31:01.847 --> 01:31:05.764
That if the CEO leaves.
everyone else can leave?

1735
01:31:05.808 --> 01:31:08.114
All the key players can leave
and destroy the network?

1736
01:31:08.332 --> 01:31:09.812
Wow. That's... Wow!

1737
01:31:10.552 --> 01:31:13.119
I think that there was a part
of Roger

1738
01:31:13.468 --> 01:31:17.123
that wanted to be remembered
as the guy who built Fox

1739
01:31:17.167 --> 01:31:19.778
and as soon as he left.
the whole thing fell apart.

1740
01:31:20.997 --> 01:31:22.651
"Bill O'Reilly's gonna leave
if I leave.

1741
01:31:22.955 --> 01:31:24.653
Greta Van Susteren's gonna leave
if I leave.

1742
01:31:24.957 --> 01:31:26.785
Jeanine.."
He went through the whole list.

1743
01:31:26.829 --> 01:31:28.221
But when are we gonna
get Megyn?

1744
01:31:28.265 --> 01:31:29.962
When are we... Right.
What's with Megyn?

1745
01:31:30.006 --> 01:31:32.487
And Irena said. "We'll have
to discuss that offline."

1746
01:31:32.835 --> 01:31:35.141
- Right.
- And Beth was livid.

1747
01:31:35.185 --> 01:31:37.666
Livid that the answer
wasn't an immediate yes.

1748
01:31:39.276 --> 01:31:41.104
female NBC anchor:
Now. another Fox News anchor

1749
01:31:41.147 --> 01:31:43.498
Megyn Kelly.
has entered the controversy.

1750
01:31:43.541 --> 01:31:46.413
female anchor #7:
Kelly told investigators
Ailes harassed her

1751
01:31:46.457 --> 01:31:49.155
when she was a young
correspondent in Washington.

1752
01:31:49.373 --> 01:31:52.811
It was explicit.
quid pro quo sexual harassment

1753
01:31:52.855 --> 01:31:55.248
which was. you know.
"Basically. you sleep with me

1754
01:31:55.292 --> 01:31:56.554
and I'll give you a promotion."

1755
01:31:56.598 --> 01:31:58.425
Uh. but I had
to shove him off of me.

1756
01:31:58.469 --> 01:32:00.210
And he came back
and I shoved him again.

1757
01:32:00.471 --> 01:32:01.646
And he came back a third time.

1758
01:32:01.690 --> 01:32:03.300
When I shoved him off
the third time.

1759
01:32:03.343 --> 01:32:05.389
he asked me
when my contract was up.

1760
01:32:06.259 --> 01:32:09.175
Congratulations. Roger.
you've finally achieved

1761
01:32:09.219 --> 01:32:10.481
your ultimate fantasy.

1762
01:32:10.699 --> 01:32:13.179
Getting fucked
by two gorgeous employees

1763
01:32:13.223 --> 01:32:14.485
at the same time.

1764
01:32:14.703 --> 01:32:15.878
[audience cheering]

1765
01:32:17.923 --> 01:32:20.535
Sarah Ellison:
Gretchen had started
a hashtag Stand With Gretchen.

1766
01:32:21.318 --> 01:32:23.668
And more accusations
kept coming out.

1767
01:32:23.712 --> 01:32:25.540
female anchor #8:
Half a dozen additional women

1768
01:32:25.583 --> 01:32:27.193
claiming the Fox News chairman

1769
01:32:27.237 --> 01:32:29.413
sexually harassed them
years ago.

1770
01:32:29.935 --> 01:32:31.720
Sarah Ellison:
And the dam broke.

1771
01:32:32.068 --> 01:32:35.245
People who had been
afraid of him for decades

1772
01:32:35.724 --> 01:32:38.509
finally felt a little bit
more emboldened

1773
01:32:38.553 --> 01:32:41.381
to actually talk about him.

1774
01:32:46.865 --> 01:32:49.564
Marsha Callahan:
When Gretchen came forward

1775
01:32:49.868 --> 01:32:52.479
I said. "I have to support
this woman.

1776
01:32:52.523 --> 01:32:54.090
I have to let her know...

1777
01:32:55.221 --> 01:32:57.789
that this has happened
for 50 years with this man.

1778
01:32:58.094 --> 01:33:01.576
And I'm a little nobody.
but I... it happened to me

1779
01:33:01.793 --> 01:33:03.273
and I want you to know that."

1780
01:33:07.582 --> 01:33:09.235
I was just beginning to model

1781
01:33:09.279 --> 01:33:11.673
and I got a call
fromThe Mike Douglas Show

1782
01:33:11.716 --> 01:33:14.589
that they wanted me
to come down and audition.

1783
01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:17.940
And then I had a call
from Roger Ailes himself

1784
01:33:18.201 --> 01:33:21.726
telling me that he wanted me
to wear a garter belt

1785
01:33:21.944 --> 01:33:23.772
and stockings and high heels.

1786
01:33:23.989 --> 01:33:25.469
And I thought
it was a little odd.

1787
01:33:25.643 --> 01:33:28.080
but I was new in this career

1788
01:33:28.124 --> 01:33:30.256
so I put them on
and went to the audition.

1789
01:33:33.216 --> 01:33:36.219
And when I got there.
he took me in his office

1790
01:33:36.262 --> 01:33:38.787
closed the door and he said.

1791
01:33:39.135 --> 01:33:41.137
"I want you
to show me your legs."

1792
01:33:41.659 --> 01:33:45.271
And I said. "Well.
w-why would you want me to...

1793
01:33:45.315 --> 01:33:46.882
why would you want me
to do that?"

1794
01:33:46.925 --> 01:33:49.449
And he said. "No. no. no.
If your legs look good

1795
01:33:49.493 --> 01:33:50.799
in the stockings
and a garter belt

1796
01:33:50.842 --> 01:33:52.322
I know you have great legs."

1797
01:33:52.670 --> 01:33:54.280
[camera clicking]

1798
01:33:54.585 --> 01:33:57.936
Then he asked me to sit
on the sofa. pull my skirt up.

1799
01:33:57.980 --> 01:34:00.983
stand in different poses.
pull my skirt up.

1800
01:34:01.287 --> 01:34:03.507
while he was taking
Polaroids of me.

1801
01:34:07.163 --> 01:34:10.732
And then he said that
he would put me on the show.

1802
01:34:10.775 --> 01:34:12.821
but I had to go to bed with him.

1803
01:34:13.038 --> 01:34:15.475
And I just said kind of off-hand

1804
01:34:15.693 --> 01:34:17.782
"Yeah. right. you and who else?"

1805
01:34:17.826 --> 01:34:19.784
And he just said. "Just me

1806
01:34:19.828 --> 01:34:22.657
and a few
of my preferred friends."

1807
01:34:25.877 --> 01:34:28.314
He was treating me
like I was a whore.

1808
01:34:28.619 --> 01:34:30.186
That's how I felt.

1809
01:34:30.708 --> 01:34:33.189
And at that point. I just said

1810
01:34:34.190 --> 01:34:37.584
"No. No. I-I-I can't do that."

1811
01:34:37.628 --> 01:34:40.979
And he said. "No. pretty girls
like you are a dime a dozen."

1812
01:34:41.719 --> 01:34:44.635
And that's when I ended
the interview and left.

1813
01:34:47.333 --> 01:34:50.032
And it never entered my head
to tell anybody

1814
01:34:50.510 --> 01:34:52.687
until I h-heard about Gretchen.

1815
01:34:54.863 --> 01:34:56.647
My son said to me. "Mom...

1816
01:34:58.867 --> 01:34:59.998
be brave.

1817
01:35:01.565 --> 01:35:04.002
Thank you for standing up
for all the women...

1818
01:35:06.526 --> 01:35:07.876
that go through this."

1819
01:35:12.576 --> 01:35:14.578
That just really
touched me that...

1820
01:35:15.100 --> 01:35:16.885
that he was proud
that I was doing it.

1821
01:35:32.901 --> 01:35:34.903
I think the twist
in the knife for Roger

1822
01:35:34.946 --> 01:35:37.253
is when he realizes
that Rupert isn't behind him

1823
01:35:37.732 --> 01:35:39.211
and that he is gonna have to go.

1824
01:35:40.299 --> 01:35:42.562
But there's still
muscle memory for Roger

1825
01:35:42.606 --> 01:35:44.739
so he's still showing up
for work.

1826
01:35:46.741 --> 01:35:48.743
So he's on his way
to the office

1827
01:35:49.265 --> 01:35:52.703
and his driver gets a call
from the head of security.

1828
01:35:53.138 --> 01:35:56.402
He says. "Please drive him
around the block a few times."

1829
01:35:59.536 --> 01:36:01.233
So there's this absurd scene

1830
01:36:01.538 --> 01:36:03.888
where his driver
drives him around

1831
01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:08.284
and then gets word that he's
been locked out of the building.

1832
01:36:11.635 --> 01:36:13.419
It's such as ignominious end

1833
01:36:13.463 --> 01:36:16.422
to not even be able to come in
and collect your things

1834
01:36:16.466 --> 01:36:18.424
from the place
that you've created.

1835
01:36:20.905 --> 01:36:23.429
They took him out
like a drone strike.

1836
01:36:23.473 --> 01:36:27.477
They just wanted
to remove him from the equation.

1837
01:36:35.398 --> 01:36:37.704
Richard Shea:
Once there was that cascade
of allegations

1838
01:36:37.748 --> 01:36:39.445
and once Rupert Murdoch

1839
01:36:39.489 --> 01:36:42.666
obviously made the decision
to fire him. that was it.

1840
01:36:43.058 --> 01:36:44.973
You didn't see him anymore.
They were gone. They were done.

1841
01:36:48.324 --> 01:36:51.109
I don't think he wanted to show
his face around town which is...

1842
01:36:51.588 --> 01:36:53.851
He must have cared about
his reputation. obviously

1843
01:36:54.156 --> 01:36:55.331
and it was..

1844
01:36:56.375 --> 01:36:58.334
That sort of thing
is not good for your reputation.

1845
01:37:01.206 --> 01:37:04.993
I will admit. too. as woman
after woman came forward.

1846
01:37:05.036 --> 01:37:07.125
although I felt sorry
for the women.

1847
01:37:07.169 --> 01:37:09.693
at the same time.
I was like. "He's done."

1848
01:37:09.911 --> 01:37:11.869
It finally happened.
he's done.

1849
01:37:13.479 --> 01:37:16.569
And I was happy that
it happened while he was alive.

1850
01:37:16.613 --> 01:37:18.484
female anchor #9:
Fox settled with Carlson

1851
01:37:18.528 --> 01:37:21.183
agreeing to pay her
a staggering 20 million...

1852
01:37:21.226 --> 01:37:22.184
Karen Kessler:
Three weeks later.

1853
01:37:22.967 --> 01:37:26.144
Gretchen got her settlement.
and 14 more women came forward

1854
01:37:26.188 --> 01:37:27.842
and said. "What about me?

1855
01:37:27.885 --> 01:37:29.800
I've got a story
that's not very different."

1856
01:37:29.844 --> 01:37:31.933
And it wasn't just confined
to Roger Ailes.

1857
01:37:31.976 --> 01:37:35.240
"A sex-fueled
Playboy Mansion-like cult."

1858
01:37:35.632 --> 01:37:38.156
That's how former hosts
describe the Fox News Channel.

1859
01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:40.985
We were abused. We were...

1860
01:37:41.203 --> 01:37:44.206
Our careers w-were destroyed
and our lives were destroyed.

1861
01:37:44.467 --> 01:37:47.122
female anchor #10:
The case gets uglier
and uglier by the day.

1862
01:37:47.165 --> 01:37:49.994
female anchor #11:
Six more women now claim
Ailes sexually harassed them.

1863
01:37:50.212 --> 01:37:53.041
female anchor #12:
In shocking accounts
reported byNew York Magazine.

1864
01:37:53.084 --> 01:37:55.347
half a dozen additional women
claiming the...

1865
01:37:55.391 --> 01:37:57.349
Laura Luhn: I didn't realize
the extent to which

1866
01:37:57.697 --> 01:37:59.656
Roger really was..

1867
01:38:00.744 --> 01:38:01.876
a predator.

1868
01:38:02.615 --> 01:38:05.836
He would have me
get down on my knees

1869
01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:09.318
and tell me.
"You know what you are. Laura?

1870
01:38:09.361 --> 01:38:13.017
You're my whore.
you're my sex slave."

1871
01:38:13.061 --> 01:38:15.367
On Fox News. Megyn Kelly
has a new book coming out.

1872
01:38:15.411 --> 01:38:18.066
- Have you read it?
- No. Have not read it. though--

1873
01:38:18.109 --> 01:38:19.719
- You're in it.
- Um..

1874
01:38:19.981 --> 01:38:21.286
[all laughing]

1875
01:38:21.765 --> 01:38:24.159
Yeah. I'm not that interested
in this. okay?

1876
01:38:24.202 --> 01:38:28.293
I'm not interested in making
my network look bad at all.

1877
01:38:28.685 --> 01:38:31.514
That doesn't interest me
one bit.

1878
01:38:32.123 --> 01:38:35.866
Nobody could have predicted how
fast the house of cards fell.

1879
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:39.174
all: Fire Bill O'Reilly.
Fire Bill O'Reilly.

1880
01:38:39.217 --> 01:38:40.784
female anchor #13:
Bill O'Reilly settled

1881
01:38:41.002 --> 01:38:46.442
a sexual harassment claim to
the tune of 32 million dollars.

1882
01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:49.575
Thirty-two million dollars.
which is around the same amount

1883
01:38:49.619 --> 01:38:51.969
O.J. Simpson had to pay
the Goldman family

1884
01:38:52.013 --> 01:38:55.059
in a civil lawsuit
for murdering two people.

1885
01:38:55.755 --> 01:38:56.931
Alisyn Camerota:
Little did we know

1886
01:38:56.974 --> 01:38:58.584
it'd have this cascading effect.

1887
01:38:59.455 --> 01:39:02.284
and that in the space
of one year.

1888
01:39:02.545 --> 01:39:04.460
Roger would be ousted.

1889
01:39:04.721 --> 01:39:06.941
that Bill O'Reilly
would be ousted.

1890
01:39:06.984 --> 01:39:11.075
This was a hit job. a political
and financial hit job

1891
01:39:11.119 --> 01:39:13.643
to bring down Fox News and me.

1892
01:39:14.557 --> 01:39:16.951
Alexis: So does that mean
things have changed at Fox?

1893
01:39:18.996 --> 01:39:20.171
I don't know.

1894
01:39:22.652 --> 01:39:23.696
I don't know.

1895
01:39:28.788 --> 01:39:33.271
How harmful has
the whole raft of allegations

1896
01:39:33.315 --> 01:39:36.318
about sexual harassment at
Fox News been for the business?

1897
01:40:12.702 --> 01:40:15.400
Tamara Holder:
I think Rupert Murdoch
is a disgusting human being.

1898
01:40:16.271 --> 01:40:20.362
He allowed so many abuses
to take place.

1899
01:40:21.450 --> 01:40:25.497
And when Rupert
went on television and said

1900
01:40:25.845 --> 01:40:28.457
that what was going on
at Fox News

1901
01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:32.374
was flirting. nonsense.

1902
01:40:32.635 --> 01:40:34.245
only Roger Ailes.

1903
01:40:35.377 --> 01:40:38.249
I knew that I had to respond.

1904
01:40:38.554 --> 01:40:41.948
Hundreds of millions of dollars
has gone to settling cases

1905
01:40:41.992 --> 01:40:45.343
with women
over and over and over again.

1906
01:40:45.387 --> 01:40:47.519
and we've been told
that we have to shut up.

1907
01:40:47.563 --> 01:40:49.173
- True.
- We just wanted to work.

1908
01:40:49.217 --> 01:40:52.220
That's all we've ever
wanted to do was work.

1909
01:40:52.568 --> 01:40:54.091
That is not nonsense.

1910
01:40:54.657 --> 01:40:56.398
This is people's lives.

1911
01:40:56.746 --> 01:40:58.530
There have been
plenty of settlements

1912
01:40:58.574 --> 01:41:00.402
that none of us know about

1913
01:41:00.706 --> 01:41:02.708
and women
who've disappeared from there

1914
01:41:02.752 --> 01:41:05.842
because they're afraid
to say anything publicly.

1915
01:41:06.451 --> 01:41:08.236
That's how big this was.

1916
01:41:22.554 --> 01:41:26.254
As more and more stories have
come forth since Roger Ailes

1917
01:41:26.471 --> 01:41:29.648
you begin to realize
that people like Roger Ailes

1918
01:41:29.692 --> 01:41:31.215
can't get away
with all this stuff.

1919
01:41:31.476 --> 01:41:33.870
if there aren't a circle
of people around them

1920
01:41:33.913 --> 01:41:36.220
that make them look better
than they are.

1921
01:41:36.264 --> 01:41:39.441
that protect them legally.
that schedule those meetings.

1922
01:41:39.484 --> 01:41:43.053
that get rid of people that
are problems. and that's not us.

1923
01:41:43.097 --> 01:41:46.404
And that's why
this is the first time publicly

1924
01:41:46.448 --> 01:41:48.711
we've really spoken about it
at all.

1925
01:41:48.754 --> 01:41:52.106
We really don't talk
about our clients.

1926
01:41:52.149 --> 01:41:54.151
and our clients
expect us not to.

1927
01:41:54.456 --> 01:41:56.893
But in this case. not only
did we not have a contract.

1928
01:41:57.459 --> 01:41:59.200
not only did we not have an NDA.

1929
01:41:59.243 --> 01:42:01.593
not only did we not have any
legal reasons why we couldn't--

1930
01:42:01.637 --> 01:42:03.421
- Or get paid.
- Or get paid.

1931
01:42:03.639 --> 01:42:05.641
but it's wrong. It's so wrong.

1932
01:42:05.815 --> 01:42:07.295
And I can't be part of that.

1933
01:42:07.338 --> 01:42:09.123
Not only am I not
gonna be a part of that.

1934
01:42:09.340 --> 01:42:12.213
I'm gonna expose it
so that these men one day

1935
01:42:12.256 --> 01:42:14.867
can get some of what
they really deserve.

1936
01:42:14.911 --> 01:42:17.479
which is that there's justice
for their victims.

1937
01:42:33.190 --> 01:42:36.193
David Shuster:
Roger died within a year
of leaving Fox News.

1938
01:42:38.674 --> 01:42:41.851
Because Fox News was
such a big part of Roger Ailes

1939
01:42:42.417 --> 01:42:43.983
that when it all fell apart

1940
01:42:44.027 --> 01:42:45.507
there was nothing left
for Roger.

1941
01:42:46.508 --> 01:42:48.162
That's who he was.

1942
01:42:49.337 --> 01:42:50.773
He was...

1943
01:42:51.687 --> 01:42:52.992
chairman of Fox.

1944
01:43:00.130 --> 01:43:01.871
Our former CEO and chairman.

1945
01:43:02.263 --> 01:43:04.221
husband to Beth. father of Zach

1946
01:43:05.527 --> 01:43:08.182
fell at his home in Florida
and did not survive.

1947
01:43:10.314 --> 01:43:12.186
Roger Ailes was a patriot.

1948
01:43:12.403 --> 01:43:14.666
He was the biggest personality
and the most influential

1949
01:43:14.710 --> 01:43:17.016
and powerful man
I ever personally encountered.

1950
01:43:17.669 --> 01:43:18.888
I loved him.

1951
01:43:19.236 --> 01:43:20.846
Roger gave
every single one of us

1952
01:43:20.890 --> 01:43:22.544
on this couch an opportunity.

1953
01:43:22.587 --> 01:43:24.850
He put food on our table.
and. you know.

1954
01:43:25.416 --> 01:43:28.550
he went out in such a sad way.
But who doesn't have sins?

1955
01:43:28.854 --> 01:43:31.901
He will be missed on this
channel. He will be missed.

1956
01:43:33.294 --> 01:43:35.209
[sniffles]

1957
01:43:36.601 --> 01:43:39.213
[firecrackers crackling]

1958
01:43:46.045 --> 01:43:50.311
Alisyn Camerota:
There's no denying.
he was a powerful

1959
01:43:50.354 --> 01:43:53.401
influential person
who changed the country.

1960
01:43:56.317 --> 01:43:58.884
Glenn Meehan:
Roger knew what fear could do.

1961
01:43:58.928 --> 01:44:01.278
Roger knew
what paranoia could do

1962
01:44:01.844 --> 01:44:03.367
uh. to the audience.

1963
01:44:04.063 --> 01:44:05.587
You know. they kept comin' back.

1964
01:44:05.848 --> 01:44:07.502
[firecrackers crackling]

1965
01:44:07.545 --> 01:44:09.243
Felycia Sugarman:
The big disappointment was that

1966
01:44:09.286 --> 01:44:12.594
he used his talent
and his media savvy

1967
01:44:12.637 --> 01:44:15.292
to build something
that drove a wedge.

1968
01:44:16.250 --> 01:44:18.252
That's. to me.
that's pretty devastating.

1969
01:44:25.041 --> 01:44:27.086
Alisyn Camerota:
I thought that things
would be more different

1970
01:44:27.130 --> 01:44:28.392
after he was gone.

1971
01:44:28.436 --> 01:44:31.961
But he casts such a long shadow

1972
01:44:32.657 --> 01:44:36.748
that his vision
can actually go on without him.

1973
01:44:40.883 --> 01:44:43.407
[crowd cheering]

1974
01:44:52.764 --> 01:44:54.592
Brian Kilmeade:
Now. there is a report
out there. guys

1975
01:44:54.636 --> 01:44:56.290
that the president
of the United States

1976
01:44:56.333 --> 01:44:58.596
watches us at 7 a.m.
Eastern Time.

1977
01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:00.598
So let's take a look
at the White House right now.

1978
01:45:00.642 --> 01:45:02.426
If-if the president of the
United States is actually

1979
01:45:02.470 --> 01:45:05.647
watching. blink the lights
on and off. okay?

1980
01:45:07.605 --> 01:45:09.303
[all laughing]

1981
01:45:09.564 --> 01:45:12.001
