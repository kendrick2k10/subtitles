I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE SHORT.

367
00:18:51.857 --> 00:18:54.198

368
00:18:54.233 --> 00:18:56.530

384
00:19:32.601 --> 00:19:33.798
I DON'T OWN THIS PLACE.

ALL RIGHT. OK.
WELL. LET'S DO THIS.

390

WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT'S GOLD.

503
00:26:54.845 --> 00:26:57.208
BARBER: I DON'T KNOW

00:27:15.294 --> 00:27:18.999
WHOA. WHOA. WHOA. HOLD ON.

512
00:27:19.034 --> 00:27:22.299
THAT I CAN GIVE YOU
SOME MONEY FOR.

513
00:27:22.334 --> 00:27:25.907
NO. THIS IS A FAMILY HEIRLOOM.

514
00:27:25.942 --> 00:27:27.238
I'M GIVING IT TO MY DAUGHTER.

515
00:27:27.273 --> 00:27:28.679
AND SHE KNOWS I'M
GIVING IT TO HER.

516
00:27:28.714 --> 00:27:30.340
SO THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT
HAPPENING.

517
00:27:30.375 --> 00:27:33.079
BARBER: LIKE I JUST SAID.
WHAT ABOUT THE THAT GOLD RING?

518
00:27:33.114 --> 00:27:38.986
THAT'LL EASILY GO FOR $300
RIGHT NOW. BIG FACES.

519
00:27:41.485 --> 00:27:42.759
300?

520
00:27:45.423 --> 00:27:46.697
OHH.

00:27:48.327 --> 00:27:50.228
UM...

522
00:27:50.263 --> 00:27:52.263
THIS...WAS MY HUSBAND'S RING.

523
00:27:52.298 --> 00:27:53.396
UM...

524
00:27:56.368 --> 00:27:58.973
NO. ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN'T
GIVE ME ANYTHING FOR THIS.

525
00:27:59.008 --> 00:28:00.909
LIKE. ANYTHING?

526
00:28:00.944 --> 00:28:03.406
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

527
00:28:03.441 --> 00:28:04.913
I'LL GIVE YOU 5.00.

528
00:28:06.279 --> 00:28:08.114
GIVE ME $10.

529
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:09.720
BARBER: I CAN'T. I'M SORRY.

530
00:28:10.987 --> 00:28:12.954
TELL YOU WHAT. YOU CAME IN HERE
LOOKING ALL GOOD

531
00:28:12.989 --> 00:28:14.758

532
00:28:15.926 --> 00:28:18.025
I'LL GIVE YOU 7.00
AS LONG AS YOU SKATE OUT SLOW

533
00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:19.224
JUST THE WAY YOU CAME IN.

534
00:28:19.259 --> 00:28:20.896
JUST GIVE ME THE $7.00. PLEASE.

535
00:28:36.012 --> 00:28:37.308

BECAUSE YOU'RE CUTE.

536
00:28:38.916 --> 00:28:40.949
DANNY: ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

537
00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:43.952
I'LL BE HERE UNTIL 8:30

00:28:43.987 --> 00:28:45.888

00:28:49.927 --> 00:28:51.487
DANNY: UM. I'M NOT SELLING
THE RING.

542
00:28:51.522 --> 00:28:54.897
BUT I MIGHT COME BACK
WITH SOME OTHER STUFF. OK?

543
00:28:54.932 --> 00:28:56.096
-I'LL BE HERE.

544
00:28:56.131 --> 00:28:57.229
THANK YOU.

00:28:57.264 --> 00:28:58.868
MAKE SURE YOU BRING THEM SKATES.

547
00:29:08.275 --> 00:29:10.539
LAMAR: AGH! I CAN'T DO IT. MAN.

548
00:29:10.574 --> 00:29:14.312
I CAN'T DO IT. I CAN'T DO IT.
FUCK THAT JOB.

549
00:29:14.347 --> 00:29:16.314
BARBER: HEY. YOU WANT TO GET

00:29:21.387 --> 00:29:23.453
BARBER: HEY.

555
00:30:07.433 --> 00:30:09.906
UM. EXCUSE ME.

556
00:30:09.941 --> 00:30:12.601
-YEAH?
-WHERE ARE MY WONTONS?

557
00:30:12.636 --> 00:30:16.143
WONTONS. HOLD UP ONE SECOND.

558
00:30:16.178 --> 00:30:20.609
-IS THIS 13032?
-YEAH.

559
00:30:20.644 --> 00:30:22.985
NO. THERE'S NO WONTONS
ON THIS ORDER.

560
00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:26.582
HEH. THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.
I ALWAYS ORDER WONTONS.

561
00:30:26.617 --> 00:30:30.091

BUT MAYBE IF YOU CHECK THE APP.

562
00:30:30.126 --> 00:30:33.028
-YOU CAN CALL AND--
-WHY DON'T YOU CHECK?

563
00:30:33.063 --> 00:30:34.557
DANNY: YEAH. I DID.

564
00:30:34.592 --> 00:30:36.097
I JUST--THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.
I JUST DID.

565
00:30:36.132 --> 00:30:38.132
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
HOW TO CHECK YOUR PHONE?

568
00:30:43.667 --> 00:30:45.337
WOMAN: MAYBE YOU DROPPED THEM
WHILE YOU WERE SKATING.

569
00:30:45.372 --> 00:30:47.878
DANNY: YEAH. THAT'S NOT
REALLY POSSIBLE.

570
00:30:47.913 --> 00:30:49.539
IS THERE A SUPERVISOR
I CAN TALK TO?

571
00:30:49.574 --> 00:30:53.312

00:31:06.162 --> 00:31:08.030
DID SHE JUST KAREN ME?

577
00:31:08.065 --> 00:31:10.395
I CAN--SUCH BULLSHIT.

578
00:31:29.383 --> 00:31:30.888
POSTPALS.

579
00:31:37.028 --> 00:31:38.126
DANNY?

580
00:31:39.558 --> 00:31:41.129
JACOB.

581
00:31:43.067 --> 00:31:45.265
I THOUGHT YOU LIVED
IN NORTH HOLLYWOOD.

582
00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:49.500
I DID. BUT M-MY ABUELITA PASSED
AND LEFT ME HER PLACE.

583
00:31:49.535 --> 00:31:52.536
OH. MAN.
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

584
00:31:52.571 --> 00:31:55.242

YOU AND WES. I'M HERE.

597
00:32:19.499 --> 00:32:21.532

00:32:28.772 --> 00:32:37.581

BROOKLYNN: YOUR LITTLE CRAZY ASS

616
00:35:10.175 --> 00:35:11.801
DANNY: OH. MY GOD.

617
00:35:11.836 --> 00:35:13.407
BROOKLYNN: YOU BETTER GET IT.

618
00:35:13.442 --> 00:35:15.277
-HA HA HA!
-HEH HEH.

619
00:35:15.312 --> 00:35:17.312
IT'S BEEN--GIRL. DON'T

620
00:35:17.347 --> 00:35:19.578
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:35:19.613 --> 00:35:22.647
I'M GOOD. YOU KNOW.
UM. I'M COOL.

622
00:35:22.682 --> 00:35:24.286
BROOKLYNN: ALL RIGHT.

623
00:35:24.321 --> 00:35:26.486
YOU KNOW. I'M JUST TRYING
TO GET SOME WORK

624
00:35:26.521 --> 00:35:30.226
AND DOING PEOPLE'S HAIR
ON THEIR PORCHES.

625
00:35:30.261 --> 00:35:34.263
BUT I CAN'T--I'M TRYING
TO FIND SOMEONE TODAY.

626
00:35:34.298 --> 00:35:35.924
EEK.
HOW YOUR MAMA DOING?

627
00:35:35.959 --> 00:35:38.168
I MEAN. SHE'S COOL.
SHE MOVED.

628
00:35:38.203 --> 00:35:40.830
SHE'S OUT OF STATE NOW.
SO IT'S JUST ME AND WES.

629
00:35:40.865 --> 00:35:42.304
AW. HOW'S SHE?

630
00:35:42.339 --> 00:35:43.602
WES IS GOOD.

631
00:35:43.637 --> 00:35:45.307
SHE'S--
SHE'S GETTING REALLY BIG.

632
00:35:45.342 --> 00:35:46.902
AND SHE'S IN SCHOOL--

633
00:35:46.937 --> 00:35:48.541
WELL. NOT--
YOU KNOW. THEY'RE ONLINE.

634
00:35:48.576 --> 00:35:49.905
BUT SHE'S OVER AT CYNTHIA'S.

635
00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:51.775
-DO YOU REMEMBER CYNTHIA?
-YEAH. YEAH.

636
00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:55.185
YEAH. SO CYNTHIA'S BEEN COOL
IN HELPING ME WITH HER.

637
00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:58.386
AND. YOU KNOW. WE'RE FINE.

638
00:35:58.421 --> 00:35:59.915
SPEAKING OF WHICH.
I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE

639
00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:02.654
FOR NOT MAKING IT
TO SAM'S MEMORIAL.

640
00:36:02.689 --> 00:36:04.458
I JUST CAN'T DO STUFF LIKE THAT.

641
00:36:04.493 --> 00:36:07.362
YEAH. I MEAN. IT'S HARD--

642
00:36:07.397 --> 00:36:09.397
IT'S HARD TO GO
TO THOSE THINGS.

643
00:36:09.432 --> 00:36:11.630
I DON'T--I DON'T BLAME YOU.

644
00:36:11.665 --> 00:36:13.599
NOBODY LIKES MEMORIALS.

645
00:36:13.634 --> 00:36:15.436
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER
SEEN YOU AT A MEMORIAL.

646
00:36:15.471 --> 00:36:16.932
I COULDN'T TELL YOU
THE LAST TIME

647
00:36:16.967 --> 00:36:18.637
I'VE BEEN TO ONE.

648
00:36:18.672 --> 00:36:19.968
BUT JUST KNOW IT WASN'T
ANYTHING PERSONAL.

649
00:36:20.003 --> 00:36:22.212
I WAS THERE WITH YOU IN SPIRIT.

650
00:36:22.247 --> 00:36:24.973
YEAH.
WHAT YOU ABOUT TO DO?

651
00:36:25.008 --> 00:36:26.678
I GOT TO WAIT FOR MY CLOTHES.

652
00:36:26.713 --> 00:36:28.449
GIRL. LOOK. YOU AIN'T
WAITING FOR NOTHING.

653
00:36:28.484 --> 00:36:29.615
THEM DRYERS AIN'T WORKING.
ALL THIS STUFF WET.

654
00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:30.748
AND MY ARMS ABOUT TO FALL OFF.

655
00:36:30.783 --> 00:36:33.454
COME WITH ME REAL QUICK.

656
00:36:33.489 --> 00:36:34.917
ALL RIGHT.
BUT I GOT TO GET BACK.

657
00:36:34.952 --> 00:36:35.984
-IT'S OK. COME ON.
-DON'T KEEP ME. BROOKLYNN.

658
00:36:36.019 --> 00:36:37.821
I KNOW HOW YOU ARE.

659
00:36:37.856 --> 00:36:39.394
BROOKLYNN: IT'S ALL RIGHT.
BUT WE ALWAYS HAVE FUN.

660
00:36:39.429 --> 00:36:40.528
DANNY: I HOPE
MY DRYER'S WORKING.

661
00:36:40.564 --> 00:36:42.298
BROOKLYNN: I SEEN YOU OUT HERE
ON YOUR LITTLE SKATES

662
00:36:42.333 --> 00:36:43.695
AND YOUR BIKER PANTS.

663
00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:44.927
DANNY: YOU KNOW. WESLEY
PICKED THIS OUT.

664
00:36:44.962 --> 00:36:46.500
BROOKLYNN: I'M SURE SHE DID.

665
00:36:46.535 --> 00:36:48.502
SHE TRYING TO FIND HER
A NEW DADDY.

666
00:36:48.537 --> 00:36:50.702
-HA HA HA!
-GIRL. TAKE ONE OF THESE ARMS.

667
00:36:50.737 --> 00:36:52.000
THIS SHIT HEAVY AS HELL.

668
00:36:52.035 --> 00:36:53.540
OK.

669
00:36:53.575 --> 00:36:54.805
-GOD. THIS IS HEAVY.
-I TOLD YOU.

670
00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:55.938
BECAUSE THEY ALL WET.

671
00:36:55.973 --> 00:36:57.775
DAMN DRYERS.

672
00:36:57.810 --> 00:37:01.713
DANNY: WES--SHE REALLY
LOVES SCIENCE NOW AND MATH.

673
00:37:01.748 --> 00:37:03.286
THAT'S HER THING.

674
00:37:03.321 --> 00:37:05.013
BROOKLYNN: OH. THAT'S
SO AWESOME.

675
00:37:05.048 --> 00:37:07.257
WE NEED SOME MORE YOUNG
FEMALE SCIENTISTS IN THE WORLD.

676
00:37:07.292 --> 00:37:09.017
DANNY: YEAH. THAT'S WHAT
SHE WANTS TO BE.

677
00:37:09.052 --> 00:37:11.360
BROOKLYNN: I LOVE IT.
GIRLS ROCK.

678
00:37:11.395 --> 00:37:13.527
HOW ARE YOUR KIDS?

679
00:37:13.562 --> 00:37:15.727
OH. CHILD. STILL

00:37:17.797 --> 00:37:19.335
DANNY: YEAH. THAT'S TRUE.

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:20.369
BROOKLYNN: OH. GOODNESS.

700
00:38:00.345 --> 00:38:03.478
OK. HIS NAME'S NOT
ACTUALLY CHAD.

701
00:38:03.513 --> 00:38:05.073
IT'S MICHAEL.
BUT I CALL HIM CHAD

702
00:38:05.108 --> 00:38:06.613
BECAUSE HE'S AN ACCOUNTANT.

703
00:38:06.648 --> 00:38:07.911

704
00:38:07.946 --> 00:38:10.045

707
00:38:15.118 --> 00:38:17.052

BUT I HAVE TO ASK.

717
00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:44.453

SAM DIDN'T TAKE CARE

EXPECT TO DIE.

-I'MMA GET YOU SOME WATER.
-NO.

847
00:45:33.061 --> 00:45:37.294
-SO YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU--
-I GOT TO GO.

848
00:45:37.329 --> 00:45:38.966
I TOLD YOU--

849
00:45:39.001 --> 00:45:40.803
BROOKLYNN: OH. MY GOD.
I NEED SOME WATER.

850
00:45:40.838 --> 00:45:43.366
DANNY: I GOT TO GO.
BROOKLYNN: OH. GIRL.

851
00:45:43.401 --> 00:45:45.170
DANNY: I GOT TO GO.
BROOKLYNN: BUT WAIT.

852
00:45:45.205 --> 00:45:47.073
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU WATER.

853
00:45:47.108 --> 00:45:50.076
DANNY: I GOT TO GET UP.
BROOKLYNN: THESE MY TOWELS?

854
00:45:50.111 --> 00:45:51.913
DANNY: WHY ARE WE HERE?
BROOKLYNN: DID I NOT

855
00:45:51.948 --> 00:45:53.508
FOLD UP THE TOWELS?

856
00:45:53.543 --> 00:45:54.982
DANNY: HOW DID WE GET HERE?
BROOKLYNN: WHO TOLD US

857
00:45:55.017 --> 00:45:57.314
TO GET ON THE SLIDE?

858
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:59.250
DANNY: THAT WAS PROBABLY
YOUR IDEA. BROOKLYNN.

859
00:45:59.285 --> 00:46:01.087
BROOKLYNN: I THINK IT WAS.

860
00:46:01.122 --> 00:46:02.924
DANNY: ALL YOUR IDEAS
END UP LIKE THIS. BROOKLYNN.

861
00:46:02.959 --> 00:46:04.156
BROOKLYNN: I HAD ANOTHER IDEA.
THOUGH.

862
00:46:04.191 --> 00:46:05.520
WHAT WAS IT?

863
00:46:05.555 --> 00:46:07.324
DANNY: NO MORE IDEAS.
I GOT TO GO.

864
00:46:07.359 --> 00:46:09.392
BROOKLYNN: WATER.
I NEED TO GET YOU WATER. DANNY.

00:46:11.330 --> 00:46:12.560
DANNY: I GOT TO GO.

00:46:12.595 --> 00:46:14.067
BROOKLYNN: OK.

868
00:46:14.102 --> 00:46:15.497
OH. MY GOD.

869
00:46:15.532 --> 00:46:17.235
I DON'T THINK I CAN MOVE.

870
00:46:19.305 --> 00:46:21.536
THERE WAS SOMETHING
I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DOING.

871
00:46:21.571 --> 00:46:23.043
DANNY: BYE. BROOKLYNN.
BYE.

872
00:46:23.078 --> 00:46:25.078
BROOKLYNN: SELL THE RING. DANNY.

873
00:46:28.215 --> 00:46:30.281
WHAT DID I DO WITH MY JOINT?

874
00:46:58.608 --> 00:46:59.816

00:52:45.691 --> 00:52:47.889
WHAT WAS I DOING
WEARING THAT THING?

900
00:52:47.924 --> 00:52:49.396
I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS.

901
00:52:49.431 --> 00:52:50.925
DO YOU SEE IT ANYWHERE?

00:52:54.238 --> 00:52:55.699

SAM WAS MY BEST FRIEND.

OK.

00:57:00.913 --> 00:57:04.618
WES IS DOING REALLY WELL
IN SCHOOL.

00:57:04.653 --> 00:57:10.151
UH. WE LIVE IN A TENT
ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.

952
00:57:10.186 --> 00:57:13.088

953
00:57:15.796 --> 00:57:18.797
WELL. THAT'S OBVIOUS AND EASY.

954
00:57:18.832 --> 00:57:21.228

955
00:57:21.263 --> 00:57:22.636
DRINK.

959
00:57:37.917 --> 00:57:39.719
DANNY. WHAT THE HELL?

960
00:57:39.754 --> 00:57:42.150
WHY HAVEN'T YOU TOLD ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

961
00:57:42.185 --> 00:57:47.188
I MEAN...I HAVEN'T TOLD
ANYBODY ANYTHING.

962
00:57:47.223 --> 00:57:50.224
I DON'T--THAT'S WHY YOU
HAVEN'T SEEN ME.

963
00:57:50.259 --> 00:57:54.030
I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO KNOW.

964
00:57:54.065 --> 00:57:55.735
I MEAN. EXCEPT FOR BROOKLYNN.
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE

965
00:57:55.770 --> 00:57:57.539
SHE GOT ME HIGH. SO...

966
00:57:57.574 --> 00:58:00.641
BROOKLYNN? WHY WOULD YOU
TELL BROOKLYNN'S CRAZY ASS?

967
00:58:00.676 --> 00:58:02.203
I RAN INTO HER.

968
00:58:05.978 --> 00:58:07.241
DANNY. WHAT DO YOU NEED?

969
00:58:10.752 --> 00:58:13.247
WELL. I NEED $200.

970
00:58:13.282 --> 00:58:14.886
LIKE. I'M GOOD FOR IT.

971
00:58:14.921 --> 00:58:17.284
I HAVE CLIENTS LINED UP
ALL NEXT WEEK.

972
00:58:17.319 --> 00:58:19.726
IT'S JUST THAT...

973
00:58:19.761 --> 00:58:21.123
I GOT SHORTED TODAY.

974
00:58:21.158 --> 00:58:23.224
AND THAT'S WHY YOU SEE ME
GOING AROUND

975
00:58:23.259 --> 00:58:25.094
DOING POSTPALS AND EVERYTHING

976
00:58:25.129 --> 00:58:28.867
BECAUSE I JUST NEED TO
GET THIS APARTMENT.

977
00:58:28.902 --> 00:58:30.638

979
00:58:36.041 --> 00:58:39.306
AND--AND WE'LL FIGURE OUT
THE REST IN A FEW DAYS.

980
00:58:39.341 --> 00:58:40.978
I APPRECIATE THAT.

981
00:58:41.013 --> 00:58:45.719
I DO. BUT. UM...IT'S JUST NOT
GONNA WORK

982
00:58:45.754 --> 00:58:48.689
BECAUSE I HAVE TO GIVE HIM
THE MONEY TODAY.

983
00:58:48.724 --> 00:58:50.988
HE'S ONLY HOLDING IT...

984
00:58:51.023 --> 00:58:52.726
FOR ONE MORE DAY.

985
00:58:52.761 --> 00:58:54.596
HE'S BEEN HOLDING IT
FOR A REALLY LONG TIME.

986
00:58:54.631 --> 00:58:58.600
SO I JUST...I DON'T KNOW. MAN.

987
00:59:00.835 --> 00:59:06.674
WELL...WHAT IF YOU AND WES
JUST COME STAY WITH ME?

988
00:59:06.709 --> 00:59:09.171
YOU CAN...BE OFF THE STREET.

989
00:59:09.206 --> 00:59:10.942
AND YOU CAN SAVE
FOR AN APARTMENT.

990
00:59:10.977 --> 00:59:13.912
AND YOU DON'T GOT TO RUSH
AND JUST TAKE ANYTHING.

991
00:59:15.179 --> 00:59:16.684
YOU SERIOUS?

992
00:59:16.719 --> 00:59:18.950
JUST STAY IN MY GRANDMA'S
OLD ROOM.

993
00:59:18.985 --> 00:59:21.623
-THIS ONE HERE?
-YEAH. THAT ONE.

994
00:59:25.090 --> 00:59:26.287
-YOU'RE NOT KIDDING?
-NO.

995
00:59:26.322 --> 00:59:28.058
I WANT YOU--I WANT TO LOOK OUT

996
00:59:28.093 --> 00:59:29.862
SO YOU CAN STAY HERE.

997
00:59:31.932 --> 00:59:38.233
DANNY: OH. MY GOD.
I MEAN--YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

998
00:59:38.268 --> 00:59:40.873
I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA
HAVE TO TELL WES.

999
00:59:40.908 --> 00:59:43.744
YOU KNOW. I'VE BEEN
TELLING HER WE'VE BEEN CAMPING.

1000
00:59:43.779 --> 00:59:45.614
SO SHE THINKS
WE'VE BEEN CAMPING.

1001
00:59:45.649 --> 00:59:47.814
AND SHE JUST KEEPS SAYING
HOW MUCH SHE WANTS TO GO HOME.

1002
00:59:47.849 --> 00:59:52.247
AND I. LIKE--
I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH.

1003
00:59:52.282 --> 00:59:54.854
DANNY. COME ON.

OH. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO
THAT. THOUGH.

1012
01:00:15.943 --> 01:00:18.911
-IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.
-DANNY.

1013
01:00:18.946 --> 01:00:21.111
DANNY. I WANT YOU.

1014

1038
01:03:17.322 --> 01:03:18.387

BROOKLYNN: WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

1047
01:03:43.887 --> 01:03:44.985
WHY WOULD YOU JUST LEAVE THEM

1048
01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:47.218
IN MY FRONT YARD LIKE THIS?

1049
01:03:47.253 --> 01:03:50.584
THESE AREN'T NEW WASHERS.

1050
01:03:50.619 --> 01:03:52.619
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GET
WATER IN HERE?

1051
01:03:52.654 --> 01:03:54.291
HEY. BROOKLYNN.

1052
01:03:54.326 --> 01:03:55.292
BROOKLYNN: SEE. THIS IS WHY
I'M LEAVING.

1053
01:03:55.327 --> 01:03:56.931
GOOD-BYE.

1054
01:03:56.966 --> 01:03:58.229
DANNY: HEY!
BROOKLYNN: OHH. HEY. GIRL.

1055
01:03:58.264 --> 01:03:59.362
-THANKS FOR CALLING ME!

1056
01:03:59.397 --> 01:04:03.201
YOU GOT IT? WHAT ARE THESE?

1057
01:04:03.236 --> 01:04:06.006
APPARENTLY MY NEW WASHERS.

1058
01:04:06.041 --> 01:04:07.502
THESE ARE YOUR NEW WASHERS?

1059
01:04:07.537 --> 01:04:09.273
GIRL. HELL. NO. THEY AIN'T NEW.

1060
01:04:09.308 --> 01:04:10.978
NO. GHETTO-ASS LANDLORD.

1061
01:04:11.013 --> 01:04:12.243
THIS WHY I'M LEAVING.

1062
01:04:15.050 --> 01:04:17.952
I KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M THINKING RIGHT NOW.

1063
01:04:17.987 --> 01:04:21.186
YOU WENT AND GOT YOUR HAIR DONE?

1064
01:04:21.221 --> 01:04:23.023
HOW--YOU WENT AND GOT
IT BRAIDED?

1065
01:04:23.058 --> 01:04:24.354
YOU KNOW I COULD HAVE
BRAIDED IT.

1066
01:04:24.389 --> 01:04:26.389
I SAT THERE
AND TOLD YOU EVERYTHING.

1067
01:04:26.424 --> 01:04:29.491
AND YOU LEFT AND GOT IT BRAIDED.
AND YOU--

1068
01:04:29.526 --> 01:04:31.328
I HADN'T SEEN YOU IN AGES.

1069
01:04:31.363 --> 01:04:33.000
I DID NOT KNOW YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO BE HERE TODAY.

1070
01:04:33.035 --> 01:04:35.233
AND IN MY DEFENSE.
I DID NOT HAVE THE MONEY.

1071
01:04:35.268 --> 01:04:37.598
CHAD PAID FOR IT
BECAUSE. YOU KNOW. HE DON'T WANT

1072
01:04:37.633 --> 01:04:42.372
HIS WOMAN OUT IN CALABASAS
LOOKING CRAZY.

1073
01:04:42.407 --> 01:04:43.912
THESE EDGES ARE TOO TIGHT.

1074
01:04:43.947 --> 01:04:45.375
YOU'RE GONNA BE LOSING
YOUR HAIR.

1075
01:04:45.410 --> 01:04:47.575
CHAD--HE GONNA PAY
FOR YOUR REGROW. TOO?

1076
01:04:47.610 --> 01:04:50.512
THE SHADE OF IT ALL.
HA HA HA!

1077
01:04:50.547 --> 01:04:51.953
WHERE'S THE RING.

1078
01:04:51.988 --> 01:04:53.988
-BAM!
-EEH!

1079
01:04:54.023 --> 01:04:56.122
OH. MY GOD!
THANK YOU SO MUCH. BROOKLYNN.

1080
01:04:56.157 --> 01:04:58.289
I TOTALLY THOUGHT
I WAS GONNA...

1081
01:04:58.324 --> 01:04:59.994
NEVER SEE THIS AGAIN.

1082
01:05:00.029 --> 01:05:01.457
YEAH. GIRL. IT WAS CRAZY.
IT WAS STUCK. LIKE.

1083
01:05:01.492 --> 01:05:02.689

01:05:04.594 --> 01:05:07.463
DUDE. YEAH. GOD.

1086
01:05:07.498 --> 01:05:09.366
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
THIS MEANS TO ME. MAN.

1087
01:05:09.401 --> 01:05:12.072

NO. LIKE. BROOKLYNN.
I TOLD YOU

1093
01:05:24.284 --> 01:05:25.547
HOW MUCH THIS MEANS TO ME.

1094
01:05:25.582 --> 01:05:27.318
THIS IS SAM'S RING.

1095
01:05:27.353 --> 01:05:29.518
I GOT SOME OTHER THINGS
BACK WHERE I'M STAYING

1096
01:05:29.553 --> 01:05:32.026

AND I'M CERTAIN

1097
01:05:32.061 --> 01:05:34.457
I CAN GET. LIKE. 200
OR SOMETHING OFF OF IT

1098
01:05:34.492 --> 01:05:37.130
IF I--LISTEN. I GOT THIS.

1099
01:05:37.165 --> 01:05:39.594
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I DON'T NEED THAT FACE.

1100
01:05:39.629 --> 01:05:43.004
BROOKLYNN: WE FOUND THAT RING
IN THAT BASKET FOR A REASON.

1101
01:05:43.039 --> 01:05:44.599
THAT WAS A SIGN FROM SAM.

1102
01:05:44.634 --> 01:05:47.140
OK. LISTEN. PASTOR BROOKLYNN.

1103
01:05:47.175 --> 01:05:49.109

DON'T YOU WORRY.
I DON'T NEED YOUR PREACHING.

01:06:12.629 --> 01:06:14.398

01:10:05.994 --> 01:10:08.962
OH. SHIT. GIRL.
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

1136
01:10:08.997 --> 01:10:10.898
DO YOU HAVE A WASHCLOTH
OR SOMETHING?

1137
01:10:10.933 --> 01:10:13.934
YOU GOT INTO IT
WITH A ICE SKATER. DIDN'T YOU?

1138
01:10:13.969 --> 01:10:15.738
THAT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE
ANY SENSE.

1139
01:10:15.773 --> 01:10:17.476
BECAUSE I THOUGHT ICE SKATERS
AND ROLLER SKATERS

1140
01:10:17.511 --> 01:10:19.412
HAVE BEEF OR SOMETHING.

1141
01:10:19.447 --> 01:10:21.645
CAN YOU JUST GIVE ME
A WASHCLOTH?

1142
01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:24.318
YELLING AT ME BECAUSE YOU DONE
SKITCHED OUT ON YOUR SKATES?

1143
01:10:26.949 --> 01:10:28.685
I DIDN'T SKITCH OUT.

1144
01:10:33.461 --> 01:10:35.989

OR A DRY ONE.

1145
01:10:37.531 --> 01:10:40.466
-THANK YOU.
-BUT SERIOUSLY.

1146
01:10:40.501 --> 01:10:41.665
WHAT HAPPENED?

1147
01:10:43.064 --> 01:10:45.504
DANNY: DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT. MAN.

1148
01:10:45.539 --> 01:10:48.375
UGH. MY FEET HURT SO BADLY.

01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:50.773
BROOKLYNN: I GUESS SO.

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:55.448
OK. SO SERIOUSLY. DID YOU WIN
THE ROLLER DERBY BATTLE?

1151
01:10:57.078 --> 01:11:00.717
I'LL TELL YOU SOME OTHER TIME.
BROOKLYNN.

1152
01:11:00.752 --> 01:11:02.653
COULD I LEAVE THIS STUFF HERE?

1153
01:11:02.688 --> 01:11:04.853
EVER SINCE YOU BEEN HERE.
YOU BEEN ASKING ME TO DO SHIT.

1154
01:11:04.888 --> 01:11:07.361
COULD YOU PLEASE HELP ME?
I CAN COME GET IT LATER.

1155
01:11:07.396 --> 01:11:09.396
I JUST NEED TO FIGURE OUT
MY NEXT MOVE.

1156
01:11:09.431 --> 01:11:10.958
IT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE
LATER. GIRL.

1157
01:11:10.993 --> 01:11:13.664
I GOT PLANS. CHAD'S ON HIS WAY
TO COME GET ME.

1158
01:11:13.699 --> 01:11:17.602
ALL RIGHT. WELL. IS THERE
ANYTHING IN MY HAIR?

1159
01:11:17.637 --> 01:11:19.571
YOU GOT GRASS IN YOUR HAIR

01:11:19.606 --> 01:11:21.639

1161
01:11:21.674 --> 01:11:25.379

ALL RIGHT. IS IT OUT?

1163
01:11:26.811 --> 01:11:28.415
BROOKLYNN: WHO DO I NEED
TO CALL?

1164
01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:31.044
-OK. IS IT OUT?
-YES.

1165
01:11:31.079 --> 01:11:32.551
DO I LOOK OK?

1166
01:11:32.586 --> 01:11:34.047
I MEAN. I GUESS.

1167
01:11:34.082 --> 01:11:35.818
LEAVE YOU ALONE
FOR A FEW MINUTES.

1168
01:11:35.853 --> 01:11:38.821
YOU COMING BACK LOOKING
ALL BEAT UP AND TATTERED.

1169
01:11:38.856 --> 01:11:42.792
ALL RIGHT. I'LL BE BACK

1170
01:11:42.827 --> 01:11:44.761

01:11:53.607 --> 01:11:54.870
DANNY: THANK YOU.

1175

01:13:21.222 --> 01:13:22.859
YOU SHOULDN'T EVEN BE
WALKING AROUND HERE.

1187
01:13:22.894 --> 01:13:26.027
LET ALONE SKATING. HUH?

1188
01:13:26.062 --> 01:13:28.898
YOU MUST GOT SOMEBODY.

1189
01:13:28.933 --> 01:13:32.099
BECAUSE IF YOU WAS ON YOUR OWN.
YOU WOULD AT LEAST HAVE A CAR.

1190
01:13:32.134 --> 01:13:35.036
ASS LIKE THAT.
YOU'D HAVE A CAR. BOAT.

1191
01:13:35.071 --> 01:13:37.412
HELICOPTER. SOMETHING.

1192
01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:43.110
YOU DON'T NEED A CAR?

1193
01:13:45.114 --> 01:13:47.719
I MEAN. ALL YOU GOT TO DO
IS TALK TO ME.

1194
01:13:47.754 --> 01:13:49.622
IT'S COMMUNICATION. YOU KNOW?

1195
01:13:51.252 --> 01:13:52.823
QUIET TYPE. HUH?

1196
01:13:54.123 --> 01:13:56.926
THAT MEANS SMART.
THAT'S WHAT MY MOTHER SAYS.

1197
01:13:56.961 --> 01:13:58.961
SHE SAYS MOST WOMEN
THAT'S REAL QUIET.

1198
01:13:58.996 --> 01:14:01.601
IT MEAN THAT THEY REALLY SMART
BECAUSE THEY LISTEN.

1199
01:14:01.636 --> 01:14:04.164
THEY ABSORB STUFF LIKE
A SPONGE. YOU KNOW.

1200
01:14:04.199 --> 01:14:06.804
AND THAT'S GOOD. YOU KNOW.

1201
01:14:06.839 --> 01:14:07.937
BUT YOU OUT HERE SKATING.

1202
01:14:07.972 --> 01:14:11.875
THAT'S--SHOULDN'T BE DOING THAT.

1203
01:14:11.910 --> 01:14:13.107
YOU SHOULD COME WITH ME.

1204
01:14:14.847 --> 01:14:18.486
I GOT A NICE LITTLE PLACE
IN CALABASAS ALL BY MYSELF

1205
01:14:18.521 --> 01:14:19.586
WITH GOLDFISH.

1206
01:14:19.621 --> 01:14:21.522
-CHAD?
-REAL QUIET.

1207
01:14:21.557 --> 01:14:22.919
THEY DON'T TALK A LOT NEITHER.

1208
01:14:22.954 --> 01:14:25.526
HEH HEH!

1209
01:14:25.561 --> 01:14:27.759
I GOT A CAT. TOO. WITH 3 LEGS.

1210
01:14:27.794 --> 01:14:29.497
IT'S A RESCUE.

1211
01:14:29.532 --> 01:14:30.762
THAT'S WHAT THEY TOLD ME
I NEEDED TO DO.

1212
01:14:30.797 --> 01:14:33.567
I NEEDED TO HAVE A RESCUE PET

1213
01:14:33.602 --> 01:14:35.261
IN ORDER TO MAKE ME LOOK GOOD.

1214
01:14:35.296 --> 01:14:37.637
IT'S COOL. HE AIN'T FUN
BECAUSE HE CAN'T DO

1215
01:14:37.672 --> 01:14:41.036
WHAT OTHER CATS DO.
BUT HE ALL RIGHT.

1216
01:14:41.071 --> 01:14:43.038
COME ON. MAKE YOUR NEXT MOVE
YOUR BEST MOVE.

1217
01:14:43.073 --> 01:14:44.171
COME WITH ME.

1218
01:14:47.077 --> 01:14:48.241
I'LL GET YOU A CAR.

1219
01:14:50.982 --> 01:14:52.982
WELL. LOOK HERE.
GET YOU SOME NEW SKATES.

1220
01:14:55.987 --> 01:15:01.562
NO? YEAH.
YOU NEED THAT. RIGHT?

1221
01:15:01.597 --> 01:15:04.598
HUH? HOW THAT SOUND? NO?

1222
01:15:06.063 --> 01:15:09.031
BECAUSE YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

1223
01:15:09.066 --> 01:15:11.605
WELL. GOD BLESS YOU.

1224
01:15:32.155 --> 01:15:34.023
SKATES DON'T COST THAT MUCH.

1225
01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:38.093
THE LORD PROBABLY
GOT YOU ANYWAY.

1226
01:16:42.863 --> 01:16:44.995
MOMMY!

1227
01:16:45.030 --> 01:16:47.360
HA HA HA! OH. MY GOD!

1228
01:16:47.395 --> 01:16:50.165
HEY. LITTLE ONE. YOU OK?

1229
01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:51.298
-GOOD!

1230
01:16:51.333 --> 01:16:52.805
-MM-HMM.
-WHAT'D YOU DO?

1231
01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:55.170
WHAT DID I DO? LET'S SEE.

1232
01:16:55.205 --> 01:16:56.842
I DID SCIENCE.
I PLAYED WITH LUKE.

1233
01:16:56.877 --> 01:16:58.173
AND I DID MATH.

1234
01:16:58.208 --> 01:16:59.845
YEAH. SHE'S BEEN
PRETTY EXCITED TODAY

1235
01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:01.209
ABOUT SOME SURPRISE.

1236
01:17:01.244 --> 01:17:02.980
YEAH. WE'RE MOVING
TO A NEW HOUSE!

1237
01:17:03.015 --> 01:17:05.785
OH. NO. NO. WE'RE NOT.

1238
01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:08.216
WE'RE GET--IT'S A DOLLHOUSE
I'M GETTING HER.

1239
01:17:08.251 --> 01:17:10.284
AND A DOLLHOUSE?
CAN WE ALSO GET A FAN?

1240
01:17:10.319 --> 01:17:12.418
ALL RIGHT. SO THANK YOU.

1241
01:17:12.453 --> 01:17:14.893
YOU'RE WELCOME OF COURSE.
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW?

1242
01:17:14.928 --> 01:17:16.763
TOMORROW. TOMORROW SOUNDS GOOD.

1243
01:17:16.798 --> 01:17:18.259
CYNTHIA: ALL RIGHT.
DANNY: ALL RIGHT. BYE.

1244
01:17:18.294 --> 01:17:19.931
WES: BYE! I WANT TO
SHOW YOU MY DOLLHOUSE.

1245
01:17:19.966 --> 01:17:21.999
DANNY: ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

1246
01:17:22.034 --> 01:17:24.100
I THOUGHT WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO KEEP OUR SECRET SECRET.

1247
01:17:24.135 --> 01:17:26.102
WES: OH. YEAH. SORRY.

1248
01:17:27.369 --> 01:17:31.437
DANNY: IT'S OUR SECRET.

1249
01:17:31.472 --> 01:17:33.681
OH.

1250
01:17:33.716 --> 01:17:37.113
WES: MOMMY. WHY ARE WE HERE?
I'M HOT.

1251
01:17:37.148 --> 01:17:39.148
BARBER: LOOK WHO'S BACK.
DANNY: YEAH.

1252
01:17:39.183 --> 01:17:40.886
BARBER: BROUGHT YOUR MINI-ME.

1253
01:17:40.921 --> 01:17:42.217
DANNY: MM-HMM.
BARBER: GOT SOMETHING FOR ME?

1254
01:17:42.252 --> 01:17:45.187
-YES. I DO.
-FOLLOW ME.

1255
01:17:52.163 --> 01:17:53.294
DANNY: I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.

1256
01:17:53.329 --> 01:17:54.834
HAVE A SEAT RIGHT HERE. BABY.

1257
01:17:57.201 --> 01:17:58.200
LISTEN.

1258
01:18:00.237 --> 01:18:04.371
OK. BABY. I HAVE SOME
BUSINESS TO TAKE CARE OF.

1259
01:18:04.406 --> 01:18:09.046
BUT I WAS THINKING BEFORE I GO
WE CAN MAKE

1260
01:18:09.081 --> 01:18:11.114
ONE MORE ANGEL WISH.

1261
01:18:11.149 --> 01:18:12.918
-OK.
-OK.

1262
01:18:12.953 --> 01:18:14.689
I'LL MAKE MINE FIRST.

1263
01:18:17.419 --> 01:18:18.693
OK.

1264
01:18:22.127 --> 01:18:23.159
WAS IT A GOOD ONE?

1265
01:18:23.194 --> 01:18:24.259
-YEAH.
-YEAH?

1266
01:18:24.294 --> 01:18:25.392
BUT HOW DO WE KNOW THAT

1267
01:18:25.427 --> 01:18:27.999
ANGELS REALLY GRANT WISHES?

1268
01:18:30.069 --> 01:18:35.468
YOU'LL KNOW THAT ANGEL WISHES
WORK THROUGH DADDY

1269
01:18:35.503 --> 01:18:37.239
BECAUSE DADDY WILL SHOW YOU.

1270
01:18:37.274 --> 01:18:39.274
THAT'S WHAT HE DOES FOR ME.

1271
01:18:47.955 --> 01:18:50.857
DANNY: I KNOW YOU MIGHT FEEL
LIKE YOU'RE ALONE SOMETIMES.

1272
01:18:53.521 --> 01:18:56.093
YOU MIGHT FEEL THAT
THINGS AREN'T FAIR

1273
01:18:56.128 --> 01:19:00.130
OR THAT A PART OF YOU
IS MISSING

1274
01:19:00.165 --> 01:19:02.902
AND THAT MAYBE EVEN
DADDY LEFT US...

1275
01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:07.038
BUT HE HASN'T.

1276
01:19:07.073 --> 01:19:09.106
I PROMISE YOU HE HASN'T...

1277
01:19:09.141 --> 01:19:13.781
I SURRENDER
ALL MY STRENGTH

1278
01:19:17.116 --> 01:19:19.886
DANNY: BECAUSE HE'S ALL
AROUND US ALWAYS.

1279
01:19:23.188 --> 01:19:25.518
DANNY: HE'S IN THE TREES...

1280
01:19:25.553 --> 01:19:30.798
FIGHTING
ETERNAL DREAMS

1281
01:19:30.833 --> 01:19:33.064
DANNY:
AND LIKE THE ROOTS OF THE TREE.

1282
01:19:33.099 --> 01:19:34.802
WE MIGHT NOT SEE THEM...

1283
01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:42.271
DANNY: BUT WE KNOW THEY'RE
THERE ALWAYS SUPPORTING US.

1284
01:19:42.306 --> 01:19:44.339
SINGER:

1285
01:19:53.251 --> 01:19:55.449
DANNY: HE'S IN THE AIR.

1286
01:19:55.484 --> 01:19:58.188
WES: EVEN IN THE SKY?

1287
01:19:58.223 --> 01:20:00.388
DANNY: EVEN IN THE SKY...

1288
01:20:04.196 --> 01:20:07.835
DANNY: AND WHEN THE WIND
WRAPS AROUND YOU.

1289
01:20:07.870 --> 01:20:10.266
YOU'LL KNOW THAT THAT'S
DADDY'S EMBRACE.

1290
01:20:13.139 --> 01:20:16.206
SO THAT'S HOW I KNOW
ANGEL WISHES WORK

1291
01:20:16.241 --> 01:20:17.812
BECAUSE I KNOW...

1292
01:20:19.948 --> 01:20:22.575
MY WISH CAME TRUE.

1293
01:20:30.651 --> 01:20:33.619

01:20:46.942 --> 01:20:49.074
-AS PROMISED.

1299
01:20:49.109 --> 01:20:51.208

1358
01:28:01.541 --> 01:28:02.969
...
WITH A RUNNING GRIN

1359
01:28:03.004 --> 01:28:04.872
TO A MAN

1360
01:28:04.907 --> 01:28:06.841

1361
01:28:06.876 --> 01:28:08.909

1365
01:28:17.084 --> 01:28:19.326
SLAY THE DEMON

1366
01:28:19.361 --> 01:28:21.053
ACROSS THE GLOBE

1367
01:28:21.088 --> 01:28:23.330

1368
01:28:23.365 --> 01:28:25.398

01:28:27.435 --> 01:28:29.468
INTENTION SO THE

01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:57.364
NEW DAY-AY-AY-AY

1371
01:29:07.970 --> 01:29:13.809
DAY-AY-AY-AY
