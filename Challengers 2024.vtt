3
00:01:04.945 --> 00:01:07.545
Ladies and gentlemen.
this final round match will be

4
00:01:07.545 --> 00:01:10.682
the best of
three tie-break sets.

5
00:01:10.682 --> 00:01:13.882
To the right of my chair.
we have Patrick Zweig.

6
00:01:13.882 --> 00:01:15.787
- Yes. Patrick!

7
00:01:16.797 --> 00:01:18.157
To the left of my chair.

8
00:01:18.157 --> 00:01:20.325
we have Art Donaldson.

9
00:01:27.472 --> 00:01:30.472
Donaldson won the toss
and has elected to serve.

10
00:01:34.976 --> 00:01:35.972
First set.

11
00:01:37.747 --> 00:01:40.185
All right!
All right.
let's bring it!

12
00:01:40.185 --> 00:01:42.077
Hey.
we love you. Art!

13
00:01:48.321 --> 00:01:49.722
Donaldson to serve.

14
00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:59.930
Ready? Play.

15
00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:17.051
Out!

16
00:02:17.051 --> 00:02:18.619
Fifteen. love.

17
00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:22.524
That's our boy.
Go. go.

18
00:02:32.431 --> 00:02:33.502
Fifteen all.

19
00:03:09.476 --> 00:03:11.336
Let's go!

20
00:03:11.336 --> 00:03:12.508
Fifteen. 30.

21
00:04:43.064 --> 00:04:44.061
Let's go.

22
00:04:57.239 --> 00:04:59.083
<i>Every premiere event
and the...</i>

23
00:04:59.083 --> 00:05:00.777
Man.
that ankle's jammed.

24
00:05:00.777 --> 00:05:02.915
I'll just stretch it
from here.

25
00:05:04.418 --> 00:05:06.382
Good. Nice and relaxed.

26
00:05:06.382 --> 00:05:09.119
All right.
put a little pressure back
and I want you to inhale.

27
00:05:11.596 --> 00:05:12.991
<i>Okay.
let's check out today's</i>

28
00:05:12.991 --> 00:05:15.766
<i>first round matchups.
Mary Jo. let's be honest...</i>

29
00:05:15.766 --> 00:05:17.393
Again.

30
00:05:17.393 --> 00:05:18.566
<i>I mean. it's safe to say that
Donaldson is a huge favorite</i>

31
00:05:18.566 --> 00:05:20.601
<i>against the French teen.
Du Maurier.</i>

32
00:05:20.601 --> 00:05:21.900
<i>Well. on paper. he is.</i>

33
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.839
<i>But because
he had surgery
last year...</i>

34
00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:25.773
Bryan.
we have the practice court
booked at 8:00.

35
00:05:25.773 --> 00:05:27.739
so we should
probably head out
in about 15 minutes.

36
00:05:27.739 --> 00:05:29.505
Yep.
he'll be ready by then.

37
00:05:29.505 --> 00:05:31.314
<i>In your first two-fifty.
as a qualifier...</i>

38
00:05:31.314 --> 00:05:32.647
- Hey. Art? Just relax.
Lily.

39
00:05:32.647 --> 00:05:33.911
you have to have some fruit
with your breakfast.

40
00:05:33.911 --> 00:05:34.844
<i>If Art can start to get</i>

41
00:05:34.844 --> 00:05:36.411
<i>some confidence
and play well.</i>

42
00:05:36.411 --> 00:05:37.482
<i>This is a great opportunity
to end that losing streak</i>

43
00:05:37.482 --> 00:05:38.852
<i>going into the US Open.</i>

44
00:05:38.852 --> 00:05:40.148
<i>Feels like he needs this win.</i>

45
00:05:40.148 --> 00:05:41.918
<i>Remember what he's
going for this year.</i>

46
00:05:41.918 --> 00:05:43.624
<i>He's got the six
Grand Slam titles.</i>

47
00:05:43.624 --> 00:05:46.028
<i>two at Wimbledon.
two Aussie Opens.</i>

48
00:05:46.028 --> 00:05:47.330
<i>two French Opens.</i>

49
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.532
<i>but he has been
chasing in vain.</i>

50
00:05:49.532 --> 00:05:51.927
<i>for years.
that elusive
US Open title</i>

51
00:05:51.927 --> 00:05:54.100
<i>to complete
the Career Slam.</i>

52
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.441
<i>What do you think.
any shot that he
gets it this year?</i>

53
00:05:56.441 --> 00:05:57.871
<i>I mean.
it's not looking good.</i>

54
00:05:57.871 --> 00:05:59.935
<i>I mean. if we just go
on the results this season.</i>

55
00:05:59.935 --> 00:06:01.780
<i>it's going to be
tough for him.</i>

56
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.010
<i>But you can never
count a guy like Art
out of the conversation.</i>

57
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.285
<i>He's got himself back healthy.
he's in really good shape.</i>

58
00:06:07.285 --> 00:06:09.278
<i>he's got a great
support team around him.</i>

59
00:06:09.278 --> 00:06:12.213
<i>His coach. Tashi Donaldson.
who also is his wife.</i>

60
00:06:12.213 --> 00:06:14.022
<i>has added a couple
of people to his team.</i>

61
00:06:14.022 --> 00:06:16.361
<i>He's got a new physiotherapist.
and he's got
a new hitting partner.</i>

62
00:06:16.361 --> 00:06:18.795
<i>So everything's there
for him to do well.</i>

63
00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:21.125
<i>Now it's just the matter
can he get his game
back on track.</i>

64
00:06:21.125 --> 00:06:22.527
<i>Yeah.
his fans are hoping we'll start</i>

65
00:06:22.527 --> 00:06:23.796
<i>to see more of the...</i>

66
00:06:23.796 --> 00:06:25.503
All right. I'm going
to go check on the car.

67
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.506
Can you have pancakes?

68
00:06:29.107 --> 00:06:30.167
I don't know. can I?

69
00:06:31.744 --> 00:06:32.904
Feed me.

70
00:06:32.904 --> 00:06:35.137
- No. you're too old.
- No. who says that?

71
00:06:35.137 --> 00:06:36.980
- Who said I'm old?
You said that.

72
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.040
Here.
- No.

73
00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.251
grandmas can
have pancakes.
come on.

74
00:06:39.251 --> 00:06:40.516
<i>Just a matter of...</i>

75
00:06:40.516 --> 00:06:42.148
One bite.
I won't tell.

76
00:06:42.148 --> 00:06:43.687
<i>...if he can click
into that mindset.</i>

77
00:06:43.687 --> 00:06:44.816
<i>Exactly.
And you know he's got</i>

78
00:06:44.816 --> 00:06:46.316
<i>a lot of things
going for him here.</i>

79
00:06:46.316 --> 00:06:48.026
<i>He knows this tournament.
he likes this tournament.</i>

80
00:06:48.026 --> 00:06:49.492
<i>and he's won here a few times.</i>

81
00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:51.820
<i>And he's got
a great record on hard courts.</i>

82
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:52.990
<i>So. if he can somehow</i>

83
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.389
<i>- find a way to get...</i>

84
00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:55.764
Your mom and dad are
going to go to work.

85
00:06:55.764 --> 00:06:56.761
and then you and me
are gonna do
some reading.

86
00:06:56.761 --> 00:06:58.333
and then go swimming
at the pool.

87
00:06:58.333 --> 00:06:59.901
Can we watch a movie?

88
00:06:59.901 --> 00:07:01.863
Later.
first we're gonna
keep reading the book

89
00:07:01.863 --> 00:07:03.237
we started yesterday.

90
00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:06.101
The one about the giraffe?

91
00:07:06.101 --> 00:07:07.673
Mm. no.
we finished that one.

92
00:07:07.673 --> 00:07:09.177
We're gonna keep
reading the one...

93
00:07:09.177 --> 00:07:10.112
Inside out!

94
00:07:11.706 --> 00:07:12.781
Cross.

95
00:07:15.052 --> 00:07:15.883
Inside out.

96
00:07:17.616 --> 00:07:18.457
Down the line.

97
00:07:21.218 --> 00:07:22.857
There was
a massager in the car?

98
00:07:22.857 --> 00:07:25.086
You grabbed that. right?
- No. the other one.

99
00:07:25.086 --> 00:07:26.864
Oh. yeah.
it's in there.

100
00:07:26.864 --> 00:07:29.598
I want you to force him
into as many
backhand rallies as you can.

101
00:07:29.598 --> 00:07:31.060
He has one big weapon.
and he wants to use it

102
00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.801
against you.
so take it away from him.

103
00:07:36.267 --> 00:07:38.273
<i>The BB and T Atlanta Open</i>

104
00:07:38.273 --> 00:07:40.478
<i>is a non-smoking event.</i>

105
00:07:40.478 --> 00:07:43.238
<i>All use of tobacco products

106
00:07:43.238 --> 00:07:45.316

107
00:07:45.316 --> 00:07:46.616
<i>except for designated
smoking areas.</i>

108
00:07:46.616 --> 00:07:49.881
Mr. Donaldson...
Mr. Donaldson. would you?

109
00:07:49.881 --> 00:07:51.589
- Thank you so much.
No problem.

110
00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:53.316
I'm rooting for you.
- Did you see that look?

111
00:07:53.316 --> 00:07:55.783
- He's gonna crush me. huh?
- Don't think about it. Leo.

112
00:07:56.822 --> 00:07:58.662
Art. over here. over here!

113
00:08:41.535 --> 00:08:42.497
Yeah?

114
00:08:43.472 --> 00:08:44.708
They're ready for you.

115
00:08:50.378 --> 00:08:51.374
You ready?

116
00:08:58.488 --> 00:08:59.657
Decimate that little bitch.

117
00:09:55.078 --> 00:09:56.514
<i>Yeah.
this match is looking like</i>

118
00:09:56.514 --> 00:09:58.277
<i>what we've come to expect
from Donaldson.</i>

119
00:09:58.277 --> 00:10:00.216
<i>Just can't seem
to find his footing.</i>

120
00:10:00.216 --> 00:10:03.553
<i>And it's given Du Maurier
the confidence he needs.</i>

121
00:10:03.553 --> 00:10:04.749
<i>Out!</i>
<i>Ouch.</i>

122
00:10:04.749 --> 00:10:06.385
<i>this is getting brutal.</i>

123
00:10:06.385 --> 00:10:08.851
<i>You just can't
be missing shots like that.</i>

124
00:10:17.128 --> 00:10:18.693
<i>And there goes the racket.</i>

125
00:10:18.693 --> 00:10:20.529
<i>Yeah. you...</i>
- He was playing really well.

126
00:10:20.529 --> 00:10:21.604
<i>...can really see
the frustration setting in.</i>

127
00:10:21.604 --> 00:10:22.804
<i>I mean. I get it.</i>

128
00:10:22.804 --> 00:10:23.966
I'm pulling you
out of Cincinnati.

129
00:10:23.966 --> 00:10:25.243
- Baby.
- Might as well

130
00:10:25.243 --> 00:10:26.711
pull you out of the Open too.

131
00:10:26.711 --> 00:10:28.710
if this isn't gonna be
your year then.
why bother?

132
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:30.446
I'm just rusty.
It's a confidence thing.

133
00:10:30.446 --> 00:10:32.178
Get your fucking
confidence back.

134
00:10:33.153 --> 00:10:34.218
I can't do that for you.

135
00:10:34.218 --> 00:10:36.080
No one's asking you to.

136
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.348
When you play
like that. you are.

137
00:10:38.824 --> 00:10:40.920
I would've killed
to have a recovery
like yours.

138
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.327
I literally would
fucking stab someone.

139
00:10:43.327 --> 00:10:44.728
A child. an old lady. like...

140
00:10:44.728 --> 00:10:46.291
I think that
they're almost done. okay?

141
00:10:46.291 --> 00:10:48.062
Where are they?
In the living room.

142
00:10:48.062 --> 00:10:50.328
They're watching Daddy's match
from earlier today.

143
00:10:51.537 --> 00:10:52.835
Mom said
we could watch it.

144
00:10:52.835 --> 00:10:55.168
What do we need to do
to get you to play again?

145
00:10:57.169 --> 00:10:58.941
What do you
need me to do. hmm?

146
00:11:02.545 --> 00:11:04.142
- Hey. baby.
- Mommy?

147
00:11:04.142 --> 00:11:06.981
- What's up?
- Can we watch <i>Spider-Verse?</i>

148
00:11:06.981 --> 00:11:09.817
Of course we can.
Of course we can.
Come here.

149
00:11:09.817 --> 00:11:11.181
We're just talking about
tennis right now.

150
00:11:11.181 --> 00:11:13.289
But you're always
talking about tennis.

151
00:11:13.289 --> 00:11:15.155
I know. I know.

152
00:11:15.855 --> 00:11:17.352
Uh. ooh. how about this?

153
00:11:17.352 --> 00:11:18.858
How about you
start it with Grandma?

154
00:11:18.858 --> 00:11:20.458
And then.
I'll come in a second

155
00:11:20.458 --> 00:11:22.357
and we can
order some room service
and watch it together.

156
00:11:22.357 --> 00:11:24.025
- How about that?
What do they have

157
00:11:24.025 --> 00:11:25.196
for room service?

158
00:11:25.196 --> 00:11:26.831
I don't know.
I don't know. I...

159
00:11:33.742 --> 00:11:35.175
She likes it here.

160
00:11:38.317 --> 00:11:39.751
We can keep staying here.

161
00:11:43.484 --> 00:11:44.481
We can.

162
00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:51.562
We can stay here.
We can just be rich people.

163
00:11:51.562 --> 00:11:53.259
That's all you
think you can handle.

164
00:11:54.695 --> 00:11:56.225
We can travel.

165
00:11:56.225 --> 00:11:58.066
We can do
the foundation full-time.

166
00:12:00.099 --> 00:12:01.872
Or you keep being
a tennis player.

167
00:12:04.234 --> 00:12:06.536
Which is what you are. Still.

168
00:12:09.512 --> 00:12:10.408
What do you want?

169
00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.358
What do you want?

170
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.892
I'm gonna be a tennis player.

171
00:12:29.892 --> 00:12:32.736
Good. Good.

172
00:12:32.736 --> 00:12:34.338
Okay.
well. we need to get you

173
00:12:34.338 --> 00:12:35.570
some more match time then.

174
00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:37.069
I can play Cincinnati.

175
00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:39.272
No. No. you cannot.
Not like this.

176
00:12:40.477 --> 00:12:42.280
Okay. how about.

177
00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.309
how about New Rochelle?

178
00:12:46.411 --> 00:12:48.777
- That's a challenger.
- Yeah. I know that.

179
00:12:48.777 --> 00:12:51.383
It's in a couple of days.
Maybe we can get you
a wildcard.

180
00:12:54.722 --> 00:12:56.058
- Art?
- Hmm.

181
00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.654
You need to start winning.

182
00:13:00.659 --> 00:13:03.560
Right now.
you're getting crushed
by guys like Du Maurier.

183
00:13:05.405 --> 00:13:07.537
So we need to go somewhere.

184
00:13:07.537 --> 00:13:09.701
where there's absolutely nobody

185
00:13:09.701 --> 00:13:12.668
on the other side of the net
who can shake
your fucking confidence.

186
00:13:14.575 --> 00:13:16.139
Okay?

187
00:13:16.139 --> 00:13:18.541
That's why we're going to...

188
00:13:18.541 --> 00:13:21.820
- Phil's Tire Town Challenger.

189
00:13:24.122 --> 00:13:26.080
- Don't get knocked out
the first round.
- You're evil.

190
00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.490
Yeah. well. I'm gonna call Tom.
see if he can get you
in the draw.

191
00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:29.828
- Hey.
- Yeah.

192
00:13:31.087 --> 00:13:31.995
I love you.

193
00:13:33.297 --> 00:13:35.090
I know.

194
00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:36.626
<i>How much
do you think you'd pay
the first serve today?</i>

195
00:13:36.626 --> 00:13:38.292
<i>Honestly.
He looks like he doesn't</i>

196
00:13:38.292 --> 00:13:39.568
<i>even wanna be out there.</i>

197
00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:10.334
Hey!

198
00:14:10.334 --> 00:14:12.836
Can I pay tomorrow?

199
00:14:12.836 --> 00:14:16.336
I've been driving all day.
I'm exhausted.

200
00:14:16.336 --> 00:14:18.500
You know. if we gave out
a bed to every tired person

201
00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.873
who walked in here
asking for one...

202
00:14:20.873 --> 00:14:22.176
Right.

203
00:14:22.176 --> 00:14:24.810
...we'd be a homeless shelter
not a business.

204
00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:25.840
Uh-huh.

205
00:14:28.653 --> 00:14:30.878
Listen. I'm a tennis player.

206
00:14:30.878 --> 00:14:33.391
Hmm.
- You know the tournament
down the road?

207
00:14:33.391 --> 00:14:35.022
Oh. that. uh... The thing

208
00:14:35.022 --> 00:14:36.959
- at the country club.
- Right. right.

209
00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:39.961
- Yeah.
- Well. you get $7.000
if you win.

210
00:14:39.961 --> 00:14:43.196
And you get money
just for qualifying.

211
00:14:43.196 --> 00:14:45.461
I just...
I need a place
to stay tonight

212
00:14:45.461 --> 00:14:46.963
so I can rest before
my first match.

213
00:14:46.963 --> 00:14:50.133
Oh. I'm sorry.

214
00:14:50.133 --> 00:14:52.502
I need a card on file.

215
00:14:52.502 --> 00:14:54.411
What if I signed a racket
and gave it to you?

216
00:14:54.411 --> 00:14:55.703
- Sir.
- Mm-hmm.

217
00:14:55.703 --> 00:14:58.543
Sir. I don't know
who you are.

218
00:15:03.582 --> 00:15:04.886
I told you I'm...
- Look at this guy.

219
00:15:04.886 --> 00:15:05.986
...a professional
tennis player.

220
00:15:05.986 --> 00:15:07.517
- He's a disaster.
- I don't know.

221
00:15:07.517 --> 00:15:10.685
- I think he's kind of cute.
- Carl. he smells.

222
00:15:10.685 --> 00:15:12.060
- The racket alone...
He's an athlete.

223
00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:13.324
- ...is worth like...
He doesn't look

224
00:15:13.324 --> 00:15:14.858
like an athlete.
he looks like a hobo.

225
00:15:14.858 --> 00:15:15.931
...$300.

226
00:15:15.931 --> 00:15:17.494
Very tall.
very handsome hobo.

227
00:15:17.494 --> 00:15:19.668
You're like a dog.

228
00:15:19.668 --> 00:15:22.071
We need a card that works.

229
00:15:22.071 --> 00:15:24.036
Look at him.
he can't pay for the room.

230
00:15:24.036 --> 00:15:25.171
Should we invite him

231
00:15:25.171 --> 00:15:26.604
- to come stay with us?

232
00:15:29.414 --> 00:15:30.410
Hey!

233
00:15:31.482 --> 00:15:34.342
Hello! Name?

234
00:15:34.342 --> 00:15:36.218
Barry Gardner.

235
00:15:36.218 --> 00:15:39.087
You know.
this looks very different
from the website.

236
00:15:39.087 --> 00:15:41.125
Oh. we're doing
some renovations.

237
00:15:41.125 --> 00:15:43.692
I just think you should
maybe update your pictures

238
00:15:43.692 --> 00:15:44.962
to reflect. you know...

239
00:15:44.962 --> 00:15:48.031
<i>The Clinton campaign paid</i>

240
00:15:48.031 --> 00:15:52.795
<i>a million dollars
to use your GPS to hire...</i>

241
00:16:40.279 --> 00:16:41.679
Sir. you can't sleep here.

242
00:16:47.793 --> 00:16:49.088
I'm not.
I'm playing at the...

243
00:16:49.088 --> 00:16:51.126
Sir. this is a private club.

244
00:16:51.126 --> 00:16:52.289
- I'm gonna have to ask you...
No.

245
00:16:52.289 --> 00:16:53.358
- ...to leave.
- No. no. no.

246
00:16:53.358 --> 00:16:55.528
I'm in the Challenger.
I'm a player.

247
00:16:56.868 --> 00:16:59.334
- Oh. Well...

248
00:17:02.171 --> 00:17:03.635
You're a bit early
for check-in.

249
00:17:04.368 --> 00:17:05.806
We're just opening up.

250
00:17:22.919 --> 00:17:25.387
Just head right in there.
She's just setting up.

251
00:17:35.336 --> 00:17:37.741
Can I help you?

252
00:17:37.741 --> 00:17:39.935
I'm a tennis player.

253
00:17:42.374 --> 00:17:45.380
I'm playing
in the Challenger.

254
00:17:45.945 --> 00:17:47.517
Name?

255
00:17:47.517 --> 00:17:49.010
Patrick Zweig.

256
00:17:51.384 --> 00:17:53.489
Oh. wow!
That's right.

257
00:17:53.489 --> 00:17:55.588
You are!

258
00:17:58.557 --> 00:17:59.555
You probably
don't remember this.

259
00:17:59.555 --> 00:18:01.558
but I was
one of the line judges

260
00:18:01.558 --> 00:18:03.629
at the Junior US Open
back in '06.

261
00:18:06.966 --> 00:18:08.964
Huh. wow.

262
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:14.442
You hungry?

263
00:18:15.612 --> 00:18:16.807
Uh...

264
00:18:17.648 --> 00:18:18.875
Yeah. Yeah.

265
00:18:20.111 --> 00:18:21.251
Thanks.

266
00:18:26.416 --> 00:18:27.752
Mm-mm.

267
00:18:28.719 --> 00:18:30.524
Well. we're happy
to have you here.

268
00:18:30.524 --> 00:18:35.928
You got your first match
against Grosu this afternoon.

269
00:18:35.928 --> 00:18:38.597
Should be a nice tournament.
Supposed to get
a little windy mid-week.

270
00:18:38.597 --> 00:18:40.904
but hopefully it'll clear up
before the finals.

271
00:18:40.904 --> 00:18:42.604
- Fingers crossed.
- I was wondering.

272
00:18:42.604 --> 00:18:44.769
is there any chance
for an advance payment
on the prize money?

273
00:18:46.141 --> 00:18:48.374
- Oh.
- Just because I'm...

274
00:18:48.374 --> 00:18:50.474
I know I'm guaranteed
a minimum of $400

275
00:18:50.474 --> 00:18:52.249
even if I get
knocked out today.

276
00:18:52.249 --> 00:18:54.546
Well. generally. we don't give
out the winnings until

277
00:18:54.546 --> 00:18:55.883
player makes his way
through the tournament.

278
00:18:55.883 --> 00:18:57.384
Right. It's just...

279
00:18:57.384 --> 00:18:59.481
I had a problem
with my card at the hotel.

280
00:18:59.481 --> 00:19:01.255
- And...
- You could

281
00:19:01.255 --> 00:19:02.917
just always lose today...

282
00:19:02.917 --> 00:19:04.855
Then we'd have to cut
your check this evening.

283
00:19:09.028 --> 00:19:10.025
Right.

284
00:19:16.839 --> 00:19:18.402
By the way.

285
00:19:18.402 --> 00:19:20.010
there's a rumor
going around

286
00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:21.938
that we had
a last-minute wildcard.

287
00:19:24.343 --> 00:19:25.546
Wanna guess who it is?

288
00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:27.776
Who?

289
00:20:13.864 --> 00:20:15.497
Advantage. Donaldson.

290
00:20:22.732 --> 00:20:24.935
Come on!
Go. let's go!

291
00:20:29.244 --> 00:20:30.413
- Fault!

292
00:20:39.022 --> 00:20:40.588
- Fuck!

293
00:20:42.051 --> 00:20:44.552
Code violation.
audible obscenity.

294
00:20:44.552 --> 00:20:46.220
Warning. Donaldson.

295
00:20:47.797 --> 00:20:48.959
Deuce.

296
00:20:57.704 --> 00:20:59.134
All right.
Come on. Art.

297
00:21:09.743 --> 00:21:12.288
Advantage. Zweig.

298
00:21:12.288 --> 00:21:14.389
Get it together. Art.
You got this.

299
00:21:14.389 --> 00:21:16.591
He almost got
another penalty.

300
00:21:48.484 --> 00:21:49.921
Yeah!

301
00:21:50.321 --> 00:21:51.362
Yes!

302
00:21:52.591 --> 00:21:55.157
- Let's go!

303
00:21:56.701 --> 00:21:57.863
Yeah!

304
00:22:00.168 --> 00:22:01.498
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

305
00:22:01.498 --> 00:22:04.441
Come on. Come on. Come on.

306
00:22:06.311 --> 00:22:07.405
Hey. guys!
Hey. guys!

307
00:22:07.405 --> 00:22:08.805
Thank you. man.

308
00:22:08.805 --> 00:22:10.071
- Good play.
Good one. man.

309
00:22:10.071 --> 00:22:11.507
Nice meeting you.
- Good one. man.

310
00:22:11.507 --> 00:22:12.683
Yeah.

311
00:22:15.286 --> 00:22:16.787
Fire and Ice. baby.
Let's go!

312
00:22:16.787 --> 00:22:18.417
Take it off!

313
00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:27.494
- Can you do me a favor?
Mm-hmm.

314
00:22:27.494 --> 00:22:29.296
Can you not
demolish me tomorrow?

315
00:22:29.296 --> 00:22:30.665
- Shut the fuck up.
- Listen.

316
00:22:30.665 --> 00:22:32.861
I'm at peace with the fact
that you're going to win.

317
00:22:32.861 --> 00:22:34.502
- It's not a fact.
- I'm just saying.

318
00:22:34.502 --> 00:22:37.673
throw me
a couple of games.
maybe a set.

319
00:22:37.673 --> 00:22:39.966
If it matters to you so much.
I can just give it to you.

320
00:22:39.966 --> 00:22:41.274
Really?
Yeah.

321
00:22:41.274 --> 00:22:42.510
- Wow! Thanks.
- I mean.

322
00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:43.973
every once in a while
a kid who wins juniors

323
00:22:43.973 --> 00:22:45.943
turns out to be
an actually great player.

324
00:22:45.943 --> 00:22:48.546
but most of them end up
in. like. the top 300.

325
00:22:48.546 --> 00:22:50.181
- It's a curse.
- You said.

326
00:22:50.181 --> 00:22:52.520
you seemed pretty excited
about winning
the doubles trophy.

327
00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.957
That was different.
That was just you and me.

328
00:22:54.957 --> 00:22:56.086
This is really fun.

329
00:22:57.554 --> 00:22:58.726
Huh.

330
00:23:00.162 --> 00:23:01.399
All right. well...

331
00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.233
But you have to actually play.

332
00:23:04.233 --> 00:23:05.665
You know.
you can't just retire.

333
00:23:05.665 --> 00:23:07.337
I need it to look like
I really beat you.

334
00:23:07.337 --> 00:23:09.636
Mm. Have you got money
on this or something?

335
00:23:09.636 --> 00:23:11.671
No. My grandma.
she's gonna be watching

336
00:23:11.671 --> 00:23:13.472
with her nursing home.
She keeps calling me

337
00:23:13.472 --> 00:23:15.642
telling me
how proud she is.

338
00:23:15.642 --> 00:23:17.242
Don't guilt me
with your dying grandmother.

339
00:23:29.689 --> 00:23:31.321
Now entering the court...

340
00:23:31.321 --> 00:23:33.492
Did Mark tell you
about the party
on Long Island?

341
00:23:33.492 --> 00:23:35.025
- The Adidas thing?
- Yeah.

342
00:23:35.025 --> 00:23:36.767
Anna Mueller.
- Yeah. I'm not going.

343
00:23:36.767 --> 00:23:37.860
What? Why not?

344
00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:40.096
We have
a final tomorrow.

345
00:23:40.096 --> 00:23:42.572
- I just told you
I'd let you win.
Mm-hmm.

346
00:23:42.572 --> 00:23:45.906
- Don't you want
to meet Tashi Duncan?

347
00:23:45.906 --> 00:23:48.077
You don't get it. man.
You've never seen her
in person.

348
00:23:48.077 --> 00:23:49.447
She's in another league.

349
00:23:49.447 --> 00:23:50.944
And now entering...
- You mean her game?

350
00:23:50.944 --> 00:23:53.044
No. I mean.
she's the hottest woman
I've ever seen.

351
00:23:53.044 --> 00:23:55.885
And winner
of the Junior Australian Open.

352
00:23:55.885 --> 00:23:57.112
Tashi Duncan.

353
00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.253
Yeah. baby! Yeah!

354
00:24:23.847 --> 00:24:26.140
Ladies and gentlemen.

355
00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:28.484
will be the best
of three tie-break sets.

356

00:24:30.414 --> 00:24:32.248
Anna Mueller.

To the right of the chair.
from the United States.

359
00:24:34.385 --> 00:24:36.151
Tashi Duncan.

360
00:24:36.151 --> 00:24:38.652
Duncan won the toss
and elected to serve.

361
00:24:38.652 --> 00:24:39.794
Fuck.

362
00:24:48.001 --> 00:24:50.772
First set.
Duncan to serve.
Ready?

363
00:24:52.041 --> 00:24:52.873
Play.

364
00:25:07.116 --> 00:25:09.021
Look at that
fucking backhand.

365
00:25:13.626 --> 00:25:14.623
Fifteen. love.

366
00:25:38.484 --> 00:25:39.854
Forty. love.

367
00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.182
Come on!

368
00:26:12.421 --> 00:26:13.415
Forty. thirty.

369
00:27:10.477 --> 00:27:14.042
She's gonna
turn her whole family
into millionaires.

370
00:27:14.042 --> 00:27:16.043
She'll have a fashion line.

371
00:27:16.043 --> 00:27:17.787
a nutritional supplement.

372
00:27:18.453 --> 00:27:20.589
a foundation.

373
00:27:20.589 --> 00:27:22.591
The Tashi Duncan Center
for Girls.

374
00:27:22.591 --> 00:27:24.486
Taking at-risk youth
off the streets

375
00:27:24.486 --> 00:27:26.121
- and onto the courts.
- Come on. Don't make fun. man.

376
00:27:26.121 --> 00:27:27.656
She's a remarkable
young woman.

377
00:27:27.656 --> 00:27:29.599
I know.

378
00:27:29.599 --> 00:27:31.702
I know.
she's a pillar
of the community.

379
00:27:34.201 --> 00:27:37.103
I'd let her fuck me
with a racket.

380
00:27:41.137 --> 00:27:43.640
Oh. God.
Look. Anna Mueller.

381
00:28:31.659 --> 00:28:34.829
- Oh. my God.
- Oy.

382
00:28:34.829 --> 00:28:36.558
I'm gonna go get my drink.

383
00:28:43.708 --> 00:28:45.703
- Hey. I'm Patrick Zweig.
- Art Donaldson.

384
00:28:45.703 --> 00:28:47.041
I know who you are.

385
00:28:47.841 --> 00:28:49.071
You're Fire and Ice. right?

386
00:28:49.071 --> 00:28:50.748
- Oh. my God.
- In the flesh.

387
00:28:54.076 --> 00:28:55.317
Which one's which?

388
00:28:55.317 --> 00:28:56.710
What do you think?

389
00:28:58.085 --> 00:29:00.347
You were
fucking incredible today.

390
00:29:00.347 --> 00:29:01.425
- Thank you.
- No. really. I mean.

391
00:29:01.425 --> 00:29:03.417
it wasn't even.
like. tennis.

392
00:29:03.417 --> 00:29:05.085
It was an entirely
different game.

393
00:29:05.085 --> 00:29:06.892
I felt bad for Anna.

394
00:29:06.892 --> 00:29:08.555
Oh. uh. don't.
She's a sore loser

395
00:29:08.555 --> 00:29:10.196
- And a racist bitch.

396
00:29:12.699 --> 00:29:13.694
She'll be okay.

397
00:29:15.706 --> 00:29:17.032
You're going
to Stanford. right?

398
00:29:17.032 --> 00:29:18.402
Yeah. how'd you know that?

399
00:29:19.875 --> 00:29:22.741
Um...
I just accepted my offer

400
00:29:22.741 --> 00:29:24.281
and they mentioned you.

401
00:29:24.281 --> 00:29:25.372
- Really?
Yeah.

402
00:29:25.372 --> 00:29:26.641
Oh.
- You're not going pro?

403
00:29:28.714 --> 00:29:29.820
No. not yet.

404
00:29:31.923 --> 00:29:34.357
Why do you waste your time
playing college tennis?

405
00:29:34.357 --> 00:29:36.450
Baby...

406
00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:38.121
I need to steal you
for a second.

407
00:29:38.121 --> 00:29:39.995
- Over at the trophies.
- Uh. okay.

408
00:29:40.927 --> 00:29:42.566
I have to go
take pictures.

409
00:29:42.566 --> 00:29:45.225
So. um. it was nice
meeting you both.

410
00:29:45.225 --> 00:29:46.298
- Yeah.
Yeah.

411
00:29:49.505 --> 00:29:50.500
Okay.

412
00:30:10.095 --> 00:30:11.560
Now what?

413
00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:12.760
What do you mean?
That was it.

414
00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.592
You don't wanna
stick around.

415
00:30:14.592 --> 00:30:16.263
- try to talk to her again?
- No. no. that'll seem
too desperate.

416
00:30:16.263 --> 00:30:18.333
We should just wait
for the shuttle back
to the hotel.

417
00:30:18.333 --> 00:30:19.463
Yeah. sure.

418
00:30:20.369 --> 00:30:21.432
Okay.

419
00:30:23.204 --> 00:30:24.498
Bring it up
for me a little bit.

420
00:30:24.498 --> 00:30:27.042
All right.
Great. great.
Good job.

421
00:30:31.109 --> 00:30:33.048
- Let's go.
- Yeah. Let's go.

422
00:30:43.288 --> 00:30:45.922
Bye.
Miss Stanford University.

423
00:30:45.922 --> 00:30:47.029
Okay. bye.

424
00:30:49.565 --> 00:30:50.560
- Hey!
- Hi!

425
00:30:52.027 --> 00:30:53.068
Hi.

426
00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:56.003
You guys are still here.

427
00:30:56.003 --> 00:30:57.567
Great party!
Uh-huh. yeah.

428
00:30:58.133 --> 00:30:59.602
Thank you.

429
00:30:59.602 --> 00:31:01.868
Um. don't you guys
have a final?

430
00:31:01.868 --> 00:31:04.508
Shouldn't you be. like. um.
preparing or something?

431
00:31:04.508 --> 00:31:05.942
- Oh. it's just the juniors.
- I think we both know

432
00:31:05.942 --> 00:31:07.082
how it's gonna go.

433
00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.182
Okay. well. um.
it's cool that you stayed.

434
00:31:11.182 --> 00:31:12.349
- Yeah. I actually wanted...
- Yeah.

435
00:31:12.349 --> 00:31:13.480
...to ask you about
that point earlier--

436
00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.621
- Hey. do you smoke?
- Cigarettes?

437
00:31:15.621 --> 00:31:16.652
- Yeah.
- No.

438
00:31:17.857 --> 00:31:19.754
- Do you?
- Yeah.

439
00:31:20.896 --> 00:31:22.163
Want to go down
to the beach?

440
00:31:26.567 --> 00:31:27.804
Sure.

441
00:31:27.804 --> 00:31:29.203
This place is ridiculous.
isn't it?

442
00:31:29.203 --> 00:31:31.365
What do you mean?
What do you mean? It's nice.

443
00:31:31.365 --> 00:31:33.569
It's like a castle.

444
00:31:33.569 --> 00:31:35.506
Like. they wanna be
feudal lords or something.

445
00:31:35.506 --> 00:31:37.708
Oh. and what does
your parents' place look like?

446
00:31:37.708 --> 00:31:39.047
Exactly.

447
00:31:39.047 --> 00:31:40.816
Not like this.
No. it's bigger.

448
00:31:40.816 --> 00:31:44.179
No. I mean. yeah.
technically it is. Yeah.

449
00:31:49.425 --> 00:31:52.262
So.
I have to ask you about
this Stanford thing.

450
00:31:52.262 --> 00:31:53.359
Okay.

451
00:31:55.466 --> 00:31:57.825
What's the angle?

452
00:31:57.825 --> 00:32:00.167
Why do you want to go beat up
on a bunch of girls

453
00:32:00.167 --> 00:32:02.203
who were the best players
at their high schools?

454
00:32:08.539 --> 00:32:11.678
You know.
they offer classes
in college.

455
00:32:11.678 --> 00:32:14.479
I don't want
my only skill in life to be
hitting a ball with a racket.

456
00:32:15.748 --> 00:32:16.811
I get it.

457
00:32:19.416 --> 00:32:20.584
You're making us
wait for you.

458
00:32:22.959 --> 00:32:25.057
The 18-year-old
tennis phenomenon

459
00:32:25.057 --> 00:32:26.755
who cares about
her education.

460
00:32:28.096 --> 00:32:29.593
Is this why you
came to my party?

461
00:32:31.262 --> 00:32:33.231
It's brilliant. Seriously.

462
00:32:33.231 --> 00:32:35.434
I can already see
the Adidas campaign.

463
00:32:36.938 --> 00:32:38.107
And when are you going pro?

464
00:32:40.236 --> 00:32:41.506
Soon as I can.

465
00:32:42.771 --> 00:32:44.613
Hitting a ball with a racket
is a great way

466
00:32:44.613 --> 00:32:46.144
to avoid having a job.

467
00:32:46.144 --> 00:32:48.378
Well. that's also
your problem.

468
00:32:48.378 --> 00:32:50.116
'Cause you think
that tennis is about

469
00:32:50.116 --> 00:32:52.253
expressing yourself.
doing your thing.

470
00:32:52.253 --> 00:32:54.783
- That's why you
still have that serve.
- It works.

471
00:32:56.619 --> 00:32:58.325
Yeah. but you're not
a tennis player.

472
00:33:00.523 --> 00:33:02.032
You don't know
what tennis is.

473
00:33:03.192 --> 00:33:04.331
What is it?

474
00:33:05.834 --> 00:33:07.268
It's a relationship.

475
00:33:13.109 --> 00:33:14.770
Is that what you
and Anna Mueller
had today?

476
00:33:16.811 --> 00:33:18.048
It is. actually.

477
00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:22.775
For about 15 seconds there.
we were actually
playing tennis.

478
00:33:22.775 --> 00:33:24.950
and we understood
each other completely.

479
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:26.155
So did everyone watching.

480
00:33:27.626 --> 00:33:29.158
It was like we were in love.

481
00:33:33.895 --> 00:33:35.560
Or like we didn't exist.

482
00:33:39.471 --> 00:33:40.730
We went somewhere

483
00:33:41.805 --> 00:33:43.296
really beautiful together.

484
00:33:43.296 --> 00:33:44.239
You screamed.

485
00:33:50.681 --> 00:33:52.816
When you hit the winner.

486
00:33:52.816 --> 00:33:54.711
Never heard
anything like it before.

487
00:34:06.255 --> 00:34:07.457
I should go

488
00:34:07.457 --> 00:34:09.657
before my dad comes
looking for me.

489
00:34:09.657 --> 00:34:11.624
- I'll see you at school. Art.
- Wait.

490
00:34:11.624 --> 00:34:13.902
- are you on Facebook?
- What?

491
00:34:13.902 --> 00:34:15.204
He's asking
for your number.

492
00:34:16.364 --> 00:34:17.404
And so am I.

493
00:34:19.077 --> 00:34:21.205
- You both want my number?
- Very much so. yeah.

494
00:34:21.205 --> 00:34:23.145
Yeah.
- Okay. well.

495
00:34:23.145 --> 00:34:25.040
- I'm not a homewrecker.
- We don't live together.

496
00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.578
- It's an open relationship.
- Also. Patrick has
a girlfriend.

497
00:34:27.578 --> 00:34:30.053
I do not. Hey.
come hang out
with us later.

498
00:34:30.053 --> 00:34:32.716
They put you up at the hotel
in Flushing. right?

499
00:34:32.716 --> 00:34:35.087
- We're in Room 206.
- Want me to come
tuck you in?

500
00:34:35.087 --> 00:34:37.886
No. We just keep talking...

501
00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:39.855
About tennis.

502
00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:43.899
Good night.

503
00:34:43.899 --> 00:34:46.059
- We have beer.
Okay.

504
00:35:12.161 --> 00:35:14.792
I'm looking
in my bag right now.

505
00:35:14.792 --> 00:35:17.524
Did you look
in the small pocket
on the side?

506
00:35:17.524 --> 00:35:19.032
I promise that's in there.

507
00:35:24.436 --> 00:35:27.735
- It's broken.

508
00:35:27.735 --> 00:35:31.137
- And she's not coming.
- She might.

509
00:35:31.137 --> 00:35:33.377
You made it sound like
we wanted to fuck her in here.

510
00:35:33.377 --> 00:35:34.578
We do want to
fuck her in here.

511
00:35:34.578 --> 00:35:37.616
Okay. yeah. maybe.
But what was your plan?

512
00:35:37.616 --> 00:35:39.923
All right. let's say
she did come over.
Then what?

513
00:35:39.923 --> 00:35:41.752
We just like.
keep shooting our shot

514
00:35:41.752 --> 00:35:44.621
until she ends up making out
with one of us. hopefully.

515
00:35:44.621 --> 00:35:46.960
and the other one.
sits in the bathroom?

516
00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.662
Sure. if it came to that.

517
00:35:48.662 --> 00:35:51.228
- What?
You think that's beneath you?
- I think it's beneath her.

518
00:35:51.228 --> 00:35:52.563
What if she chooses you?

519
00:35:52.563 --> 00:35:54.099
You won't feel comfortable
sending me away?

520
00:35:54.099 --> 00:35:55.770
She's not coming. Patrick!

521
00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:14.288
Art!
What?

522
00:36:14.288 --> 00:36:15.854
Fucking ash!
I found it.

523
00:36:15.854 --> 00:36:16.886
Oh. dude.

524
00:36:21.665 --> 00:36:22.496
Wait.

525
00:36:23.061 --> 00:36:24.058
Oh. shit.

526
00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:26.863
- Hi!
- Hey!

527
00:36:28.571 --> 00:36:31.533
Did you guys go to. like.
Mommy And Me classes
together?

528
00:36:33.804 --> 00:36:35.545
What?
You just seem like brothers.

529
00:36:35.545 --> 00:36:38.706
Well. that's what
the Mark Rebellato
Tennis Academy will do for you.

530
00:36:38.706 --> 00:36:40.643
Oh. Right. right. right.

531
00:36:40.643 --> 00:36:42.184
You guys went
to boarding school.

532
00:36:42.184 --> 00:36:44.645
Mm.
We've been bunkmates
since we were 12.

533
00:36:44.645 --> 00:36:46.013
- So...
- That's really cute.

534
00:36:46.013 --> 00:36:47.714
You ever thought about
doing something like that?

535
00:36:47.714 --> 00:36:48.849
- Boarding school?
Mm.

536
00:36:48.849 --> 00:36:50.293
No. No. no. no.
We couldn't afford it.

537
00:36:50.293 --> 00:36:52.128
And even if I could get
a scholarship or something.

538
00:36:52.128 --> 00:36:53.558
there's no way that
my parents would want me

539
00:36:53.558 --> 00:36:55.331
coming of age
in an environment like that.

540
00:36:56.325 --> 00:36:57.494
Huh.

541
00:36:57.494 --> 00:36:59.368
Why? What were
they afraid of?

542
00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:05.241
- Oh. yeah.
- Right.

543
00:37:05.241 --> 00:37:07.700
So. um. is that
where you met your girlfriend?

544
00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:09.169
Oh. she's not my. um...

545
00:37:10.109 --> 00:37:11.510
Yeah. yeah.

546
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:13.046
And you?
Why aren't you pretending

547
00:37:13.046 --> 00:37:14.149
not to have a girlfriend?

548
00:37:14.149 --> 00:37:16.042
- Art's in between ladies.
- Oh. no. no.

549
00:37:16.042 --> 00:37:17.347
That makes it sound
like I'm some sort of...

550
00:37:17.347 --> 00:37:18.417
Player.
- Yeah.

551
00:37:18.417 --> 00:37:20.188
Yeah.
Art does fine
for himself.

552
00:37:20.188 --> 00:37:22.358
- I mean. look at him.

553
00:37:22.956 --> 00:37:23.953
So...

554
00:37:26.557 --> 00:37:28.097
How often
does this happen?

555
00:37:28.097 --> 00:37:30.198
- Uh...
- Going after the same girl.

556
00:37:30.198 --> 00:37:31.427
Not as often
as you think actually.

557
00:37:31.427 --> 00:37:32.427
- Really?
No.

558
00:37:32.427 --> 00:37:33.695
Yeah. no. we. uh...

559
00:37:33.695 --> 00:37:35.061
We usually have
different types.

560
00:37:35.061 --> 00:37:38.003
Hmm. So you're saying
I should be flattered?

561
00:37:38.003 --> 00:37:39.337
- Well...
- No.

562
00:37:39.337 --> 00:37:40.772
Aren't you
everybody's type?

563
00:37:47.314 --> 00:37:48.751
What about the two of you?

564
00:37:48.751 --> 00:37:50.111
What do you mean?

565
00:37:55.285 --> 00:37:56.690
Oh!

566
00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:57.792
No.

567
00:37:57.792 --> 00:37:59.494
No.

568
00:38:01.063 --> 00:38:02.959
Why? Is that surprising?

569
00:38:08.639 --> 00:38:09.804
What?

570
00:38:09.804 --> 00:38:11.132
- Well...
- No.

571
00:38:12.667 --> 00:38:14.538
- I mean...
- No.

572
00:38:14.538 --> 00:38:16.277
- Patrick. no.
Sorry.

573
00:38:16.277 --> 00:38:17.475
Yes. I think you need
to tell me now.

574
00:38:17.475 --> 00:38:19.105
- No.
- I think it's a sweet story.

575
00:38:19.105 --> 00:38:21.245
- Uh-huh. All right.
- Well. let's hear it.

576
00:38:21.245 --> 00:38:22.808
Yeah. no. go ahead.

577
00:38:22.808 --> 00:38:24.086
- Uh...

578
00:38:24.086 --> 00:38:27.247
I taught Art
how to jerk off. so.

579
00:38:30.591 --> 00:38:33.293
Okay. Patrick was
an early bloomer. okay?

580
00:38:33.293 --> 00:38:35.327
And I think
that I was on time.

581
00:38:35.327 --> 00:38:38.334
And one time.
when we were 12.

582
00:38:38.334 --> 00:38:41.437
he thought I was asleep
and he was. you know...

583
00:38:42.867 --> 00:38:44.107
- Jerking off.
- Jerking off. And. yeah...

584
00:38:44.107 --> 00:38:46.336
And I asked him.
"What are you doing?"

585
00:38:46.336 --> 00:38:47.505
And he told me.

586
00:38:47.505 --> 00:38:49.105
- He's jerking off.
- Jerking off.

587
00:38:49.105 --> 00:38:52.144
He asked me if
I had ever done it before
and I told him no.

588
00:38:52.144 --> 00:38:54.714
And so. he just...

589
00:38:55.314 --> 00:38:57.153
He showed me how.

590
00:39:00.324 --> 00:39:02.120
What do you mean
he showed you how?

591
00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:03.256
No. I mean...

592
00:39:03.256 --> 00:39:04.927
- Well...
I mean. he did it

593
00:39:04.927 --> 00:39:06.796
- on his bed.
- Okay.

594
00:39:06.796 --> 00:39:09.196
I did it on my bed.
We did it together.
but like on opposite sides...

595
00:39:09.196 --> 00:39:10.592
- in the room.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

596
00:39:10.592 --> 00:39:11.896
You know.

597
00:39:15.134 --> 00:39:16.037
Silent?

598
00:39:16.037 --> 00:39:17.372
- Oh. no. no.
- No. no.

599
00:39:17.372 --> 00:39:19.933
No. we were talking
about Kat. weren't we?

600
00:39:19.933 --> 00:39:21.109
- Kat Zimmerman.
- Patrick said

601
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:22.278
- it's always better...
- Yeah.

602
00:39:22.278 --> 00:39:23.444
...if you're like thinking
about somebody

603
00:39:23.444 --> 00:39:25.043
when you're doing it.
And so I asked him

604
00:39:25.043 --> 00:39:27.149
who you're thinking about.
and he was talking
about this girl.

605
00:39:27.149 --> 00:39:28.612
- Kat Zimmerman.
- Kat Zimmerman.

606
00:39:28.612 --> 00:39:31.344
And so. I thought
about her. too.

607
00:39:32.747 --> 00:39:34.146
- Wow.
- Yeah.

608
00:39:34.146 --> 00:39:37.325
Okay.
and who finished first?

609
00:39:37.325 --> 00:39:38.758
- Oh. I don't remember.
- I think you.

610
00:39:40.497 --> 00:39:44.466
And. well.
how was it afterwards?

611
00:39:44.466 --> 00:39:46.398
I think Art
was a little surprised

612
00:39:46.398 --> 00:39:48.294
by the whole thing.
He was...

613
00:39:48.294 --> 00:39:50.868
He was just sitting there
covered in all of it.

614
00:39:50.868 --> 00:39:52.538
What?
- He looked like a kid

615
00:39:52.538 --> 00:39:54.177
who'd spilled milk
all over his lap.

616
00:39:54.177 --> 00:39:56.542
Jesus. Patrick!

617
00:39:56.542 --> 00:39:57.905
I knew enough already
at this point

618
00:39:57.905 --> 00:40:00.072
- to have a sock nearby.
- Right.

619
00:40:00.072 --> 00:40:01.476
Forgot to tell Art
about that part.

620
00:40:01.476 --> 00:40:02.817
Yeah.

621
00:40:02.817 --> 00:40:03.783
Mm-hmm.

622
00:40:05.352 --> 00:40:06.385
Yeah. so.

623
00:40:06.385 --> 00:40:09.488
Yeah.
- Right. Okay.

624
00:40:09.488 --> 00:40:12.492
And what about
Miss Zimmerman?

625
00:40:12.492 --> 00:40:14.629
Whatever happened to her?
You guys...

626
00:40:15.757 --> 00:40:17.158
Neither of us...

627
00:40:17.158 --> 00:40:19.594
She got injured
a week later
and had to quit.

628
00:40:19.594 --> 00:40:20.998
Really?

629
00:40:20.998 --> 00:40:21.895
She wasn't
very good in the first place.

630
00:40:21.895 --> 00:40:23.071
- No. she sucked.
Yeah.

631
00:40:23.071 --> 00:40:25.398
Yeah.

632
00:40:25.398 --> 00:40:27.207
Yeah. no. you're right.
That is a very cute story.

633
00:40:27.207 --> 00:40:28.670
Thanks.

634
00:40:33.478 --> 00:40:34.649
We're out of beer.

635
00:40:43.124 --> 00:40:44.593
Um...

636
00:41:09.854 --> 00:41:10.850
Come here.

637
00:41:12.083 --> 00:41:14.150
- Which one of us would you...

638
00:43:41.633 --> 00:43:42.699
Okay.

639
00:43:47.441 --> 00:43:48.645
I'm going to bed.

640
00:43:51.039 --> 00:43:52.605
What about your number?

641
00:43:52.605 --> 00:43:54.816
- I told you.
I'm not a homewrecker.
Please.

642
00:43:55.647 --> 00:43:57.954
Um...

643
00:43:57.954 --> 00:44:00.115
Okay. uh...

644
00:44:00.115 --> 00:44:01.918
I will be watching
your match tomorrow.

645
00:44:01.918 --> 00:44:03.789
Whoever wins
can have my number.

646
00:44:03.789 --> 00:44:05.321
All right.

647
00:44:06.826 --> 00:44:08.990
You can beat him.
you know that.

648
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:10.499
You should
beat him actually.

649
00:44:10.499 --> 00:44:12.065
Are you saying
you want me to?

650
00:44:12.065 --> 00:44:14.061
I'm saying you're not going
to get my number if you don't.

651
00:44:14.061 --> 00:44:15.329
But what do you want?

652
00:44:15.329 --> 00:44:18.466
I want to watch
some good fucking tennis.

653
00:44:21.012 --> 00:44:22.008
Good night.

654
00:44:28.544 --> 00:44:30.343
Remember when you said
you'd let me win?

655
00:44:30.343 --> 00:44:32.115
That was
a lifetime ago.

656
00:44:32.115 --> 00:44:33.488
- What about my grandmother?
- Hope she has

657
00:44:33.488 --> 00:44:35.490
- a fucking stroke.

658
00:45:06.213 --> 00:45:08.219
- Wow.

659
00:45:11.887 --> 00:45:13.224
Thirty. forty.

660
00:45:15.694 --> 00:45:16.961
That's how you do it!

661
00:45:16.961 --> 00:45:20.099
Nice!
That's the way you play!

662
00:45:20.995 --> 00:45:21.936
Go!

663
00:45:42.687 --> 00:45:43.925
Thirty. love.

664
00:45:50.428 --> 00:45:52.230
Forty. love.
Come on. Art.
you got this!

665
00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:54.727
It's not over. Art!
Hang in there. Art!

666
00:45:56.139 --> 00:45:57.301
Fault!

667
00:46:09.277 --> 00:46:10.914
Game and first set. Zweig.

668
00:46:10.914 --> 00:46:14.054
Zweig leads one set to love.

669
00:47:05.602 --> 00:47:08.768
So stupid losing
to guys like this. Victor.

670
00:47:13.317 --> 00:47:14.846
Fucking idiot.

671
00:47:28.464 --> 00:47:29.459
Fuck.

672
00:47:44.505 --> 00:47:46.311
Nice match. Zweig.

673
00:47:48.418 --> 00:47:51.049
You too. Grosu.

674
00:47:51.049 --> 00:47:52.482
- Tough break.

675
00:47:58.350 --> 00:47:59.929
Calm. Victor.

676
00:48:15.772 --> 00:48:17.677
What are you doing
with your life?

677
00:48:17.677 --> 00:48:18.913
How did you get like this?

678
00:48:18.913 --> 00:48:21.913
You can't beat some
fucking loser like him?

679
00:48:21.913 --> 00:48:23.117
How can you call yourself...

680
00:48:37.132 --> 00:48:39.699
So. do you.
like. play at Wimbledon

681
00:48:39.699 --> 00:48:42.264
or the US Open or what?

682
00:48:42.264 --> 00:48:44.897
Yeah. sometimes.
When I qualify.

683
00:48:46.135 --> 00:48:47.871
- Really?
- Yeah.

684
00:48:47.871 --> 00:48:49.739
What does that mean?

685
00:48:49.739 --> 00:48:54.112
Well. those big tournaments
usually have spots
for 128 players.

686
00:48:54.112 --> 00:48:55.947
So if you're ranked
in the top 100.

687
00:48:55.947 --> 00:48:58.051
then you instantly get a spot.

688
00:48:58.051 --> 00:49:00.854
but everyone else has
to play a sort of. uh.

689
00:49:00.854 --> 00:49:02.547
tournament before
the tournament.

690
00:49:02.547 --> 00:49:04.624
- Okay.
- Some years I make it.

691
00:49:04.624 --> 00:49:06.554
some years I don't.

692
00:49:06.554 --> 00:49:08.622
But. um. if I win this thing
in New Rochelle.

693
00:49:08.622 --> 00:49:11.132
my ranking will be
high enough for the Open.

694
00:49:12.096 --> 00:49:13.230
So. you'll get a spot?

695
00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:16.236
I'll get a spot
in the qualifiers.

696
00:49:17.808 --> 00:49:20.009
- Oh. okay.

697
00:49:20.809 --> 00:49:22.506
I told you tennis is boring.

698
00:49:23.172 --> 00:49:24.778
No. really...

699
00:49:24.778 --> 00:49:26.743
It's. um. it's interesting.

700
00:49:26.743 --> 00:49:27.775
Excuse me.

701
00:49:29.313 --> 00:49:30.948
Can I get a tea
with some lemon?

702
00:49:30.948 --> 00:49:32.417
Coming right up.

703
00:49:37.587 --> 00:49:41.327
Uh. so. tell me
about real estate law.

704
00:49:43.327 --> 00:49:45.694
Uh. I don't know.
well. um...

705
00:49:46.669 --> 00:49:48.301
- My firm...
- Mm-hmm.

706
00:49:48.301 --> 00:49:50.973
Well. it's not my firm.
but the firm that I work for.

707
00:49:50.973 --> 00:49:52.971
we actually do something
called estate planning.

708
00:49:52.971 --> 00:49:54.671
Which is a little different.

709
00:49:54.671 --> 00:49:57.836
I used to do real estate law
with this firm in Hartsdale...

710
00:49:57.836 --> 00:49:59.277
which I don't know
if you know where that is

711
00:49:59.277 --> 00:50:00.342
- but it's just five minutes...
- Thank you.

712
00:50:00.342 --> 00:50:01.783
...down the road
if you're driving.

713
00:50:01.783 --> 00:50:03.178
but. um. yeah.
I left that firm.

714
00:50:03.178 --> 00:50:05.678
It was small. Anyway.

715
00:50:05.678 --> 00:50:09.185
- Um. I deal with trusts and...
- Trust.

716
00:50:09.185 --> 00:50:11.759
...uh. power of attorney...

717
00:50:11.759 --> 00:50:13.352
Go ask them about the beds.

718
00:50:13.352 --> 00:50:14.820
- Oh. okay.
- Okay.

719
00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:16.429
Do you want us to wait
to FaceTime with Dad?

720
00:50:16.429 --> 00:50:18.667
No. no. it's okay.
Do you mind taking this
upstairs for me?

721
00:50:18.667 --> 00:50:19.967
- Okay. Sure.
- Okay. Love you.

722
00:50:19.967 --> 00:50:21.030
- We'll be right up.
- All right. honey.

723
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:22.300
All right. see you.

724
00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:24.167
Anything that. you know.
you have to deal with

725
00:50:24.167 --> 00:50:27.043
when someone crosses over...

726
00:50:28.502 --> 00:50:31.206
- Are you okay?
- Huh?

727
00:50:31.206 --> 00:50:32.514
Are you... Are you okay?

728
00:50:32.514 --> 00:50:33.973
Uh. yeah. Yeah.

729
00:50:35.149 --> 00:50:37.515
Can you excuse me?
I just have to...

730
00:50:38.421 --> 00:50:39.418
Yeah.

731
00:50:47.392 --> 00:50:48.797
What the fuck
are you doing here?

732
00:50:48.797 --> 00:50:50.697
I'm playing
at the Challenger.

733
00:50:50.697 --> 00:50:52.296
Yeah. I know that.

734
00:50:52.296 --> 00:50:54.164
But you're not
staying here.
are you?

735
00:50:54.164 --> 00:50:56.632
No. Why are you staying here?

736
00:50:56.632 --> 00:50:58.833
I assumed you guys would
rent a villa or something.

737
00:50:59.708 --> 00:51:01.209
Lily likes hotels.

738
00:51:03.404 --> 00:51:04.873
Our daughter.

739
00:51:04.873 --> 00:51:06.575
Oh.

740
00:51:06.575 --> 00:51:08.245
Art can't see us together.
He already thinks

741
00:51:08.245 --> 00:51:09.910
I planned this
to humiliate him.

742
00:51:11.381 --> 00:51:13.716
- Didn't you?

743
00:51:14.459 --> 00:51:15.520
Not this part.

744
00:51:26.297 --> 00:51:27.896
Are you on a fucking date?

745
00:51:27.896 --> 00:51:29.199
No.

746
00:51:29.199 --> 00:51:31.107
Well. yeah. but it's not...

747
00:51:32.777 --> 00:51:34.209
I just need
a place to sleep.

748
00:51:35.205 --> 00:51:36.206
- What?
- Wow.

749
00:51:36.206 --> 00:51:37.579
Can't all stay at the Ritz.

750
00:51:37.579 --> 00:51:39.441
Mm. Okay. well.

751
00:51:39.441 --> 00:51:41.851
Can you seal the deal
and leave?

752
00:51:41.851 --> 00:51:43.517
You're on opposite sides
of the draw.

753
00:51:43.517 --> 00:51:46.879
You're not gonna
play each other unless
you're both in the final.

754
00:51:46.879 --> 00:51:48.552
I don't think we have
to worry about that.

755
00:51:48.552 --> 00:51:51.292
No. you typically fall apart
in the second round.

756
00:51:55.823 --> 00:51:57.028
Your mom looks good.

757
00:51:57.028 --> 00:51:58.893
I know she does. Patrick.

758
00:52:05.106 --> 00:52:06.401
Do me a favor.

759
00:52:06.401 --> 00:52:08.001
Stay the fuck
away from us.

760
00:52:21.153 --> 00:52:22.521
Sorry. that was a. uh...

761
00:52:23.857 --> 00:52:24.985
Uh. hey...

762
00:52:31.992 --> 00:52:33.331
<i>Junior training sessions</i>

763
00:52:33.331 --> 00:52:36.205

766

<i>Coach Stevens.</i>

767
00:52:47.479 --> 00:52:49.116
What do you mean
you won't say?

768
00:52:49.116 --> 00:52:51.012
- I don't kiss and tell.
- Since when?

769
00:52:51.012 --> 00:52:53.618
Since she told me
she'd stop seeing me
if I told anyone.

770
00:52:58.453 --> 00:52:59.690
And go!

771
00:53:00.955 --> 00:53:02.930
Yep. yep. good.
- All right.

772
00:53:04.465 --> 00:53:06.366
Right. but she had to know
that you were gonna talk to me.

773
00:53:06.366 --> 00:53:08.036
She didn't indicate that
there were any exceptions.

774
00:53:08.036 --> 00:53:11.038
All right. fine.
Then give me a signal.

775
00:53:11.038 --> 00:53:12.435
Isn't this hard
for you to hear?

776
00:53:12.435 --> 00:53:13.875
Like. wouldn't you
rather not?

777
00:53:13.875 --> 00:53:16.439
No. I'm very happy for you.

778
00:53:16.439 --> 00:53:18.043
I just don't wanna
feel left out.

779
00:53:21.851 --> 00:53:22.977
There you go!

780
00:53:26.251 --> 00:53:27.685
Okay. how about this?

781
00:53:27.685 --> 00:53:29.384
If the two of you
slept together.
do a normal serve.

782
00:53:29.384 --> 00:53:30.992
- Art.
- I'm not asking

783
00:53:30.992 --> 00:53:32.553
you to tell me.
I'm just saying.

784
00:53:32.553 --> 00:53:35.390
if you fucked.
serve like me.

785
00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:36.859
- Like you?
Yeah.

786
00:53:39.068 --> 00:53:41.232
You know you have
a tic. right?

787
00:53:41.232 --> 00:53:42.867
Before you throw the ball up

788
00:53:42.867 --> 00:53:44.933
you place it
in the exact center
of the neck of the racket.

789
00:53:53.612 --> 00:53:57.010
Okay. fine. yeah.
Do that.
If you fucked.

790
00:53:57.010 --> 00:53:58.417
I'm not telling you
anything. Art.

791
00:53:58.417 --> 00:54:00.454
You won't be
telling me anything.
Come on.

792
00:55:25.605 --> 00:55:27.901
- Everything okay?
- I'm okay. thank you.

793
00:55:27.901 --> 00:55:29.477
Excuse me. Tashi.
- No. it's okay.

794
00:55:37.847 --> 00:55:38.917
- Thank you.
Thank you.

795
00:55:38.917 --> 00:55:40.015
Of course.

796
00:55:46.186 --> 00:55:49.365
<i>Time. Second set.
Donaldson to serve.</i>

797
00:56:21.119 --> 00:56:22.827
There you go!

798
00:56:36.969 --> 00:56:39.479
He's pretty funny.

799
00:56:39.479 --> 00:56:41.216
He's. like.
always cracking jokes.

800
00:56:41.216 --> 00:56:43.017
It just sounds so hard.

801
00:56:43.017 --> 00:56:44.178
It's not.

802
00:56:45.588 --> 00:56:47.982
I don't know I feel.
like. out of all my classes...

803
00:56:47.982 --> 00:56:49.918
All right.
so when are you going pro?

804
00:56:49.918 --> 00:56:52.357
Um. well.
if we win the championship.

805
00:56:52.357 --> 00:56:54.691
- then I'll leave.
- So. May.

806
00:56:54.691 --> 00:56:57.590
- I said. if we win.
- Right. So. May.

807
00:56:57.590 --> 00:57:00.168
Um...

808
00:57:00.168 --> 00:57:01.502
Did Patrick tell you
he's coming

809
00:57:01.502 --> 00:57:04.371
- to the Pepperdine match?
- Hmm. Yeah. he told me.

810
00:57:04.371 --> 00:57:06.534
We should get dinner
or something.

811
00:57:06.534 --> 00:57:07.771
Sure. If you want.

812
00:57:10.979 --> 00:57:12.505
What's up?

813
00:57:12.505 --> 00:57:13.548
Nothing.

814
00:57:14.575 --> 00:57:15.649
Art.

815
00:57:18.049 --> 00:57:19.421
The whole thing you're doing.
you're not good at it.

816
00:57:19.421 --> 00:57:21.283
- It's fucking stupid.
- I'm not doing a thing.

817
00:57:21.283 --> 00:57:23.055
I'm just surprised that
you guys are
still seeing each other.

818
00:57:23.055 --> 00:57:23.921
That's all.

819
00:57:27.921 --> 00:57:29.091
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

820
00:57:32.502 --> 00:57:34.668
Why did you ask me
to come to lunch with you?

821
00:57:35.767 --> 00:57:37.105
I told you.
I had extra meal credits

822
00:57:37.105 --> 00:57:38.403
and they were
going to expire.

823
00:57:38.403 --> 00:57:39.635
Don't be such
a fucking pussy.

824
00:57:39.635 --> 00:57:40.869
Is he seeing other girls
on tour?

825
00:57:40.869 --> 00:57:42.170
- No. I mean...
- Is that what this is?

826
00:57:43.343 --> 00:57:44.411
- I don't know.
- What?

827
00:57:44.411 --> 00:57:45.477
That's not what
I'm trying to say.

828
00:57:45.477 --> 00:57:46.845
Then what are you
trying to say?

829
00:57:50.252 --> 00:57:51.619
- Okay.

830
00:57:55.125 --> 00:57:56.448
He's not in love
with you.

831
00:58:06.132 --> 00:58:08.262
What makes you think
I want someone
to be in love with me?

832
00:58:09.372 --> 00:58:10.570
Did I ever say I was
in love with him?

833
00:58:10.570 --> 00:58:11.968
- You didn't.
- So why would I give a fuck

834
00:58:11.968 --> 00:58:13.568
- if he loved me or not?
- I guess you wouldn't.

835
00:58:13.568 --> 00:58:14.675
- Cool.
- Cool.

836
00:58:16.038 --> 00:58:17.135
Don't you think
you deserve it?

837
00:58:17.135 --> 00:58:18.413
Jesus fucking Christ.

838
00:58:18.413 --> 00:58:19.977
I mean.
who wouldn't be
in love with you?

839
00:58:25.216 --> 00:58:26.755
Think you might be
the worst friend in the world.

840
00:58:26.755 --> 00:58:27.912
Maybe.

841
00:58:27.912 --> 00:58:29.019
Definitely!

842
00:58:30.358 --> 00:58:32.693
Thank you.
For lunch. Art.

843
00:58:43.372 --> 00:58:45.340
Whoo-hoo! Let's go!

844
00:58:45.340 --> 00:58:47.508
Who the fuck is this guy?

845
00:58:47.508 --> 00:58:49.337
- Does he go here?
I don't know.

846
00:58:49.337 --> 00:58:51.310
- I don't... I don't think so.
Come on. Donaldson.

847
00:58:51.310 --> 00:58:52.581
big serve! Big serve!

848
00:58:57.846 --> 00:58:58.881
That's right. baby!

849
00:58:58.881 --> 00:59:00.380
Show that motherfucker
who's boss.

850
00:59:02.886 --> 00:59:04.758
Finish it up. Donaldson.
come on.

851
00:59:11.826 --> 00:59:12.865
Whoa!

852
00:59:13.664 --> 00:59:14.735
All right.

853
00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:20.708
Come on. Come on. Come on.

854
00:59:24.276 --> 00:59:25.339
Art!

855
00:59:28.176 --> 00:59:29.215
Out of the way.
out of the way!

856
00:59:50.264 --> 00:59:51.706
So. how's the tour?

857
00:59:52.933 --> 00:59:54.038
No fun stuff?

858
00:59:54.736 --> 00:59:55.839
Like what?

859
00:59:55.839 --> 00:59:57.608
I don't know.
Are you seeing anybody?

860
00:59:57.608 --> 00:59:59.908
What do you mean?
I'm taken.

861
00:59:59.908 --> 01:00:01.045
What do you think
I'm doing here?

862
01:00:07.753 --> 01:00:09.053
You're not here
to visit me?

863
01:00:12.291 --> 01:00:13.453
What?

864
01:00:18.633 --> 01:00:19.965
You're really committing
to this thing?

865
01:00:21.633 --> 01:00:23.202
- To Tashi?
- Hmm.

866
01:00:23.202 --> 01:00:25.463
Yeah. I mean.

867
01:00:25.463 --> 01:00:27.500
we're taking it step by step.
but. you know...

868
01:00:28.506 --> 01:00:29.678
I like her.

869
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:33.814
I think she'd make me
an honest man.

870
01:00:37.652 --> 01:00:40.249
- You don't believe me?
- No. I'm just...

871
01:00:40.249 --> 01:00:43.489
I'm not sure how
she's thinking
about all of this.

872
01:00:43.489 --> 01:00:44.792
I don't want you
to get hurt.

873
01:00:47.218 --> 01:00:48.820
You don't want me to get hurt?

874
01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:49.863
Hmm.

875
01:00:53.162 --> 01:00:55.198
- Did she say something to you?
- No.

876
01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:58.968
I just got the impression
she's not thinking

877
01:00:58.968 --> 01:01:01.875
about this as
a serious relationship.

878
01:01:03.213 --> 01:01:04.642
You got that impression?

879
01:01:04.642 --> 01:01:06.114
From a conversation we had.

880
01:01:06.114 --> 01:01:08.046
- Huh!
- Hmm.

881
01:01:12.782 --> 01:01:14.289
You fucking snake.

882
01:01:14.289 --> 01:01:16.516
Honestly. I'm proud of you.

883
01:01:16.516 --> 01:01:19.088
- I'd be doing the same thing.
- I'm not doing anything.

884
01:01:19.088 --> 01:01:21.730
It's fine. It's exciting
to see you this way.

885
01:01:22.995 --> 01:01:24.130
It's what's been missing
from your tennis.

886
01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:26.425
What?

887
01:01:26.425 --> 01:01:29.702
It's nice to see you
lit up about something.

888
01:01:29.702 --> 01:01:31.168
Even if that something
is my girlfriend.

889
01:01:31.168 --> 01:01:32.766
That's what the two of you
are calling each other now?

890
01:01:32.766 --> 01:01:34.532
Hmm.

891
01:01:34.532 --> 01:01:36.338
You know this makes
it hotter for me. right?

892
01:01:37.513 --> 01:01:39.445
You sitting here
pining for her.

893
01:01:39.445 --> 01:01:40.614
I would never do anything

894
01:01:40.614 --> 01:01:41.778
- to get in the way of you...
- I know.

895
01:01:41.778 --> 01:01:43.283
- ...and your girlfriend.
- I know.

896
01:01:43.283 --> 01:01:44.544
It's not your style.

897
01:01:46.050 --> 01:01:47.646
You're playing
percentage tennis.

898
01:01:48.589 --> 01:01:49.890
Waiting for me to fuck up.

899
01:01:55.189 --> 01:01:56.930
Come on.
walk me over there.

900
01:02:39.441 --> 01:02:40.732
I missed you.

901
01:02:47.475 --> 01:02:49.745
You have any idea
how lonely it is on tour?

902
01:02:49.745 --> 01:02:51.345
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

903
01:02:51.345 --> 01:02:53.344
Is that why you haven't won
any challengers?

904
01:02:53.344 --> 01:02:55.219
I just told you I missed you.

905
01:03:12.169 --> 01:03:15.239
I watched
the Shinoda match online.

906
01:03:15.239 --> 01:03:16.970
And you could've won.
but then you started tanking

907
01:03:16.970 --> 01:03:18.308
in the third set.

908
01:03:19.679 --> 01:03:21.479
- Tashi. come on.
- What?

909
01:03:21.479 --> 01:03:22.609
Look at me.

910
01:03:24.083 --> 01:03:25.577
When were you gonna
tell me about Art?

911
01:03:25.577 --> 01:03:27.416
Thought you knew
about that.

912
01:03:28.322 --> 01:03:29.517
I mean...

913
01:03:31.189 --> 01:03:33.625
I feel bad because
I know he's in pain.

914
01:03:33.625 --> 01:03:35.688
- but...
- Right. but?

915
01:03:37.293 --> 01:03:39.000
What? You're not
intimidated by him?

916
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:39.959
No.

917
01:03:39.959 --> 01:03:42.230
- Really?
- No.

918
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:44.499
- Well. you should be.
- Uh-huh. Why?

919
01:03:46.168 --> 01:03:47.942
- Because he's smart.
- Yeah.

920
01:03:48.841 --> 01:03:50.943
- He's good looking.
- Yeah.

921
01:03:50.943 --> 01:03:53.141
And he's really
fucking good at tennis.

922
01:03:53.141 --> 01:03:54.947
Oh. he's always
been very good.

923
01:03:54.947 --> 01:03:57.352
Yeah.
but he's gotten a lot better

924
01:03:57.352 --> 01:03:58.645
since he's been here.

925
01:04:00.054 --> 01:04:01.820
Are the two of us
still playing for your number?

926
01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:04.057
- I thought I won.

927
01:04:05.329 --> 01:04:06.686
That's your problem.

928
01:04:06.686 --> 01:04:08.897
You always think you've won
before the match is over.

929
01:04:12.129 --> 01:04:13.561
Are we talking
about tennis?

930
01:04:15.463 --> 01:04:16.872
We're always
talking about tennis.

931
01:04:19.539 --> 01:04:20.667
Can we not?

932
01:04:27.348 --> 01:04:28.180
Sure.

933
01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:34.050
What are you doing?

934
01:04:34.050 --> 01:04:36.614
I'm getting ready
for my match.

935
01:04:36.614 --> 01:04:39.026
Start my routine.
I'll see you there.

936
01:04:40.594 --> 01:04:42.063
- Tashi.
- What?

937
01:04:42.063 --> 01:04:43.631
If you're not interested
in me fixing your game
for free.

938
01:04:43.631 --> 01:04:45.593
don't worry about it.
It's fine.

939
01:04:47.030 --> 01:04:48.627
Why do you care so much?

940
01:04:48.627 --> 01:04:50.168
Well. we're dating. right?
So. I don't know.

941
01:04:50.168 --> 01:04:51.835
Should be
a little embarrassing
if you suck.

942
01:04:51.835 --> 01:04:54.005
- I suck now?
- God.

943
01:04:54.005 --> 01:04:56.000
It's not college tennis
out there.

944
01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.580
We can't all walk around
calling ourselves
"The Duncanator."

945
01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:01.140
- Wow.
- I'm sorry. I just...

946
01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:03.311
Okay. No. it's fine.

947
01:05:03.311 --> 01:05:04.642
Look. I'm happy
they like you here.

948
01:05:04.642 --> 01:05:05.981
I just don't need you
to be my coach.

949
01:05:05.981 --> 01:05:07.417
Well. someone needs to be.

950
01:05:09.525 --> 01:05:10.757
Can we just start over?

951
01:05:10.757 --> 01:05:12.684
What do you think
you need from me?

952
01:05:12.684 --> 01:05:14.919
Honestly.
what do you think
you need from me?

953
01:05:14.919 --> 01:05:17.757
A cheerleader?
A girlfriend?
A fuck buddy?

954
01:05:17.757 --> 01:05:19.998
Like. there's plenty
of girls out here
that would

955
01:05:19.998 --> 01:05:21.896
love to be
your girlfriend. okay?

956
01:05:21.896 --> 01:05:23.600
You're charming.

957
01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:26.073
You're talented.
you got a big dick.
Just go be with one of them.

958
01:05:27.944 --> 01:05:29.909
Is this like.
a new strategy
you're using

959
01:05:29.909 --> 01:05:31.175
to pump yourself up
before the match?

960
01:05:31.175 --> 01:05:33.210
Have a little fight
to get the energy going?

961
01:05:33.210 --> 01:05:35.407
I don't need a fight
to get the energy going.

962
01:05:35.407 --> 01:05:37.181
No. Just an hour
of meditation.

963
01:05:37.181 --> 01:05:39.249
And what?
You think that's lame?

964
01:05:39.249 --> 01:05:40.745
I think it's unnecessary
given you're playing

965
01:05:40.745 --> 01:05:43.014
Sally Fucking Country Club
from Pepperdine.

966
01:05:43.014 --> 01:05:45.917
And how's coasting
by on talent going for you?

967
01:05:48.664 --> 01:05:50.126
You know
how ridiculous it is

968
01:05:50.126 --> 01:05:51.960
to hear you
call me every week.

969
01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:54.869
talking about all the ways
that you're getting
screwed over on tour?

970
01:05:54.869 --> 01:05:56.962
As if that's a good use
for my fucking time?

971
01:05:56.962 --> 01:06:00.767
- Well. excuse me
for inconveniencing you.
- You are. actually.

972
01:06:00.767 --> 01:06:02.871
I need to be alone.
So can I just
meet you there?

973
01:06:02.871 --> 01:06:04.742
- No.
- What?

974
01:06:04.742 --> 01:06:07.048
I'm not going to the match.
Not if you think you can just
dismiss me.

975
01:06:07.048 --> 01:06:09.245
I'm not some fucking lapdog
who's gonna sit around

976
01:06:09.245 --> 01:06:12.149
and let you punish me.
I'm not Art.

977
01:06:12.149 --> 01:06:13.880
Or maybe you need
someone like that.

978
01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:16.822
Someone who's
gonna hop on board
and be Mr. Tashi Duncan.

979
01:06:16.822 --> 01:06:18.087
Is that what
you think I want?

980
01:06:18.087 --> 01:06:20.754
Yeah. A member
of the fan club.

981
01:06:25.967 --> 01:06:27.530
You're not a member
of my fan club?

982
01:06:29.170 --> 01:06:31.905
I'm your peer.
I'm not your fucking groupie.

983
01:06:31.905 --> 01:06:33.437
And I'm definitely
not your student.

984
01:06:35.939 --> 01:06:36.869
All right.

985
01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:41.313
Good luck. champ.

986
01:07:27.993 --> 01:07:29.629
Come on.
- Hi.

987
01:07:29.629 --> 01:07:31.024
- Sorry.
- Hi.

988
01:07:31.024 --> 01:07:32.067
Thank you.

989
01:07:34.027 --> 01:07:38.001
<i>And now. your 2002. 2005.</i>

990
01:07:38.001 --> 01:07:41.800
<i>and 2006 NCAA champion.</i>

991
01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:44.039
<i>give it up for
Stanford Women's Tennis.</i>

992
01:07:44.039 --> 01:07:45.707
Go Stanford!

993
01:07:46.283 --> 01:07:47.577
Hey!

994
01:07:49.414 --> 01:07:51.449
Tashi!

995
01:07:52.454 --> 01:07:54.221
Tashi!

996
01:07:57.056 --> 01:07:59.688
Tashi! We love you. Tashi!

997
01:08:04.467 --> 01:08:06.464
Yeah. whoo!

998
01:08:07.801 --> 01:08:09.203
Tashi!

999
01:08:10.903 --> 01:08:12.140
Yeah. let's go!

1000
01:08:27.389 --> 01:08:30.551
<i>On court one.
Maria Foster from Pepperdine.</i>

1001
01:08:30.551 --> 01:08:33.219
<i>and from Stanford.
Tashi Duncan.</i>

1002
01:08:40.727 --> 01:08:42.896
We love you. Tashi!

1003
01:09:48.298 --> 01:09:49.935
Oh. my God. oh. my God.

1004
01:09:57.576 --> 01:10:00.641
Okay. Tashi.
you're okay. You're okay.

1005
01:10:00.641 --> 01:10:02.347
out of the way!

1006
01:10:02.347 --> 01:10:04.982
On your back.
Okay. try to breathe.

1007
01:10:04.982 --> 01:10:06.553
Okay. you're okay.

1008
01:10:08.821 --> 01:10:10.753
Okay. okay. okay.

1009
01:10:12.755 --> 01:10:15.062
Look at me.
Tashi. look at me. okay?

1010
01:10:15.062 --> 01:10:18.162
Just breathe.
Just breathe.
Breathe.

1011
01:10:18.162 --> 01:10:19.828
It's torn up pretty bad.

1012
01:10:19.828 --> 01:10:21.559
but we won't know for sure
until we get the X-rays

1013
01:10:21.559 --> 01:10:22.695
from the hospital.

1014
01:10:22.695 --> 01:10:24.170
Did you see it happen?

1015
01:10:24.170 --> 01:10:25.570
Yeah. it was pretty quick.

1016
01:10:25.570 --> 01:10:28.568
Just a slip and then
she landed on it
the wrong way.

1017
01:10:28.568 --> 01:10:30.236
That's all it takes.

1018
01:10:30.236 --> 01:10:33.776
Yeah.
Let's just hope
it's not as bad as it looks.

1019
01:10:35.216 --> 01:10:36.811
Did you get an ETA
on the ambulance?

1020
01:10:36.811 --> 01:10:38.885
Yeah. they said
they're on their way.

1021
01:10:42.583 --> 01:10:43.816
- I'm sorry.
- Out.

1022
01:10:43.816 --> 01:10:45.522
- Listen. Tashi! Tashi...
- Get out! Out!

1023
01:10:45.522 --> 01:10:46.995
- Tashi. Tashi. listen. please.
Out!

1024
01:10:46.995 --> 01:10:48.923
- Out!
- Patrick. get the fuck out!

1025
01:11:31.303 --> 01:11:32.939
- Out!

1026
01:11:32.939 --> 01:11:34.037
Thirty. love.

1027
01:11:34.037 --> 01:11:35.402
That was out!

1028
01:11:35.402 --> 01:11:36.943
That was way out!

1029
01:11:36.943 --> 01:11:39.079
The ball was called in.

1030
01:11:39.079 --> 01:11:40.447
- Are you blind?
Zweig!

1031
01:11:40.447 --> 01:11:42.247
Are you here to do your job.
or you're just excited

1032
01:11:42.247 --> 01:11:43.914
that Art Donaldson's
over there?

1033
01:11:43.914 --> 01:11:46.710
I'm going to give you
a code violation
if you don't stop this.

1034
01:11:46.710 --> 01:11:48.121
Hey. Art!

1035
01:11:48.121 --> 01:11:49.888
This lady wants
your autograph.

1036
01:11:53.084 --> 01:11:55.753
Code violation.
Unsportsmanlike conduct.

1037
01:11:55.753 --> 01:11:57.629
Point penalty. Zweig.

1038
01:11:59.161 --> 01:12:02.168
Come on. Patrick!
Just play the game.

1039
01:12:02.168 --> 01:12:03.798
This how you wanna
get your points?

1040
01:12:03.798 --> 01:12:06.335
- I'm ready to serve. Patrick.
- Yeah. I bet.

1041
01:12:06.335 --> 01:12:07.507
Forty. love.

1042
01:12:20.857 --> 01:12:22.555
Stop going easy on me.

1043
01:12:25.056 --> 01:12:26.119
I'm not.

1044
01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:40.964
Hit the ball!
- Tashi--

1045
01:12:40.964 --> 01:12:42.509
Actually fucking
hit the ball.

1046
01:12:44.174 --> 01:12:45.171
Come on.

1047
01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:49.417
You afraid you're
gonna hurt me?

1048
01:12:53.854 --> 01:12:54.851
Pussy.

1049
01:12:59.024 --> 01:13:00.021
Wait!

1050
01:13:05.228 --> 01:13:06.500
Okay?

1051
01:13:13.602 --> 01:13:15.003
And actually try to win.

1052
01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:18.743
Please.

1053
01:13:40.862 --> 01:13:42.331
Hey.
I'm fine.

1054
01:13:42.331 --> 01:13:43.295
You okay?

1055
01:13:46.801 --> 01:13:47.805
I'm good.
I'm okay.

1056
01:14:01.482 --> 01:14:02.314
I'm fine.

1057
01:14:03.550 --> 01:14:04.382
I'm okay.

1058
01:14:05.255 --> 01:14:06.285
I'm fine.

1059
01:14:07.125 --> 01:14:08.122
I'm okay.

1060
01:14:09.899 --> 01:14:11.527
Come here.

1061
01:14:11.527 --> 01:14:14.199
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1062
01:15:39.747 --> 01:15:40.918
More aggressive.

1063
01:15:45.423 --> 01:15:46.517
Little higher.

1064
01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:48.596
More aggressive.

1065
01:15:58.569 --> 01:16:00.003
Just invite her to serve.

1066
01:16:06.174 --> 01:16:08.041
Oh. come on. you can
sleep in tomorrow. right?

1067
01:16:08.041 --> 01:16:09.911
Katerina's match
isn't until nighttime.

1068
01:16:09.911 --> 01:16:11.352
No. Are you kidding?

1069
01:16:11.352 --> 01:16:12.650
I wake her up early
to run drills.

1070
01:16:12.650 --> 01:16:14.049
Oh. she's lucky
to have you.

1071
01:16:14.049 --> 01:16:16.015
You're getting
too much height

1072
01:16:16.015 --> 01:16:17.682
- on your ball toss.
I am?

1073
01:16:17.682 --> 01:16:19.823
Uh-huh. Yeah.
Whenever you guys
are ready.

1074
01:16:19.823 --> 01:16:21.255
Thanks.
- You're a great spot server.

1075
01:16:21.255 --> 01:16:24.392
but right now.
you're checking in
at like 129. 130.

1076
01:16:24.392 --> 01:16:26.458
But I think with. like.
a few adjustments.
you'd get to 135.

1077
01:16:29.099 --> 01:16:31.933
But you should listen to Karl.
He is your coach.

1078
01:16:31.933 --> 01:16:33.531
I'm just Katerina's
hitting partner.

1079
01:16:35.305 --> 01:16:38.613
Maybe you wanna jump ship?
Come be my assistant coach?

1080
01:16:39.741 --> 01:16:41.508
Oh. I get it.

1081
01:16:41.508 --> 01:16:44.284
You want to work
with someone who has
a little bit more potential.

1082
01:16:44.284 --> 01:16:46.082
No! No.
No. it's not that.

1083
01:16:46.082 --> 01:16:48.216
I mean. you have plenty
of potential. It's just...

1084
01:16:49.458 --> 01:16:51.087
You think that would be
a good idea?

1085
01:16:51.993 --> 01:16:52.924
Why not?

1086
01:16:57.832 --> 01:17:00.126
- That was a long time ago.
- It was not that long ago.

1087
01:17:00.126 --> 01:17:01.793
Well. it feels like
a long time ago.

1088
01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:06.905
So. you're saying
you're not in love
with me anymore?

1089
01:17:11.776 --> 01:17:13.612
I'm really
proud of you. Tashi.

1090
01:17:13.612 --> 01:17:15.382
- I'm serious. I'm serious.
- Oh. God.

1091
01:17:15.382 --> 01:17:17.080
- You're doing really well.
- Okay.

1092
01:17:18.477 --> 01:17:20.245
What?
You think I was
going to. like.

1093
01:17:20.245 --> 01:17:22.116
- kill myself
after the injury?
- No.

1094
01:17:22.116 --> 01:17:23.988
No. I'm just glad
that you didn't quit tennis.

1095
01:17:25.354 --> 01:17:28.087
Yeah. well. unfortunately.
my only skill in life

1096
01:17:28.087 --> 01:17:29.458
is hitting a ball
with a racket.

1097
01:17:35.097 --> 01:17:37.529
This is really stupid.
but. uh...

1098
01:17:40.366 --> 01:17:41.973
After your injury...

1099
01:17:44.038 --> 01:17:45.471
I couldn't help but just...

1100
01:17:46.845 --> 01:17:49.282
think about what
would have happened

1101
01:17:49.282 --> 01:17:51.180
if I had beaten Patrick.

1102
01:17:53.119 --> 01:17:54.821
So you want me
to join your team
because you feel guilty?

1103
01:17:56.057 --> 01:17:57.790
No.

1104
01:17:57.790 --> 01:17:59.826
I want you to join my team
because I want to win.

1105
01:18:02.962 --> 01:18:05.029
I think you'd beat him now
if you guys played.

1106
01:18:05.530 --> 01:18:06.833
Don't you think?

1107
01:18:08.730 --> 01:18:09.737
Don't know.

1108
01:18:11.336 --> 01:18:12.366
We. uh...

1109
01:18:13.908 --> 01:18:17.442
haven't played professionally.
and don't keep in touch.

1110
01:18:17.442 --> 01:18:20.038
- What?

1111
01:18:20.038 --> 01:18:21.078
Just...

1112
01:18:22.484 --> 01:18:24.851
I was a homewrecker.
wasn't I?

1113
01:18:31.556 --> 01:18:32.925
- Art.
- Yeah.

1114
01:18:35.889 --> 01:18:38.392
You never really said
if you're still
in love with me or not.

1115
01:18:44.338 --> 01:18:45.498
Who wouldn't be?

1116
01:19:15.798 --> 01:19:16.903
What?

1117
01:19:21.976 --> 01:19:25.241
I really wanna
kiss you right now.

1118
01:19:27.712 --> 01:19:29.178
But I'm afraid if I try.

1119
01:19:29.178 --> 01:19:31.445
you'll think I'm
the worst friend
in the world.

1120
01:19:42.955 --> 01:19:43.897
To who?

1121
01:20:16.664 --> 01:20:18.793
Oh. my...
Oh. my God!

1122
01:20:47.488 --> 01:20:49.356
Game and
second set. Donaldson.

1123
01:20:49.356 --> 01:20:51.195
- Six-two. Match is tied.

1124
01:20:51.195 --> 01:20:52.999
One set all.

1125
01:20:55.735 --> 01:20:57.905
Code violation. racket abuse.

1126
01:20:58.572 --> 01:21:00.534
Point penalty. Zweig.

1127
01:21:02.410 --> 01:21:04.444
Please. please.

1128
01:21:08.548 --> 01:21:10.607
New balls. please.

1129
01:21:22.493 --> 01:21:25.528
He's not bad. I've played him
at a few of these things.

1130
01:21:25.528 --> 01:21:27.666
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be
prostituting yourself

1131
01:21:27.666 --> 01:21:28.833
for a place
to sleep tonight?

1132
01:21:28.833 --> 01:21:32.700
I'm staying at
that girl's house.

1133
01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:35.475
- Mm. Must be the love.
- Hey. come have
a cigarette with me.

1134
01:21:35.475 --> 01:21:37.177
I have to talk to you.

1135
01:21:37.177 --> 01:21:40.343
Yeah. I don't smoke.
And I'm not talking to you.

1136
01:22:00.296 --> 01:22:01.768
I'm going to propose
something to you.

1137
01:22:01.768 --> 01:22:03.098
Can you blow it
away from me. please?

1138
01:22:03.098 --> 01:22:06.706
Sorry. It's gonna
make you angry.

1139
01:22:06.706 --> 01:22:08.536
It's gonna make you
very angry.

1140
01:22:13.714 --> 01:22:15.246
I want you to be my coach.

1141
01:22:18.319 --> 01:22:20.010
What?

1142
01:22:20.010 --> 01:22:23.785
Even if he wins the Open.
completes his
career Grand Slam.

1143
01:22:23.785 --> 01:22:28.092
Art's still gonna retire
as someone
who's just really. really good.

1144
01:22:28.092 --> 01:22:30.292
That's what you guys
will have done together.

1145
01:22:30.292 --> 01:22:33.094
But imagine if you could turn
Patrick Zweig

1146
01:22:33.094 --> 01:22:34.793
into a guy who wins a Slam.

1147
01:22:36.329 --> 01:22:38.198
I still have a season.

1148
01:22:38.198 --> 01:22:39.740
I still have
one good season.

1149
01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:41.503
and I need you
to bring it out of me.

1150
01:22:45.170 --> 01:22:46.145
So...

1151
01:22:47.812 --> 01:22:48.906
what do you think?

1152
01:22:50.147 --> 01:22:51.879
- How fucking dare you?

1153
01:22:51.879 --> 01:22:52.984
Jesus Christ!

1154
01:22:52.984 --> 01:22:54.547
You want my
best piece of advice?

1155
01:22:54.547 --> 01:22:55.949
- Do you want me
to coach you?
- Yeah.

1156
01:22:55.949 --> 01:22:57.825
Okay. quit.

1157
01:22:57.825 --> 01:23:00.455
Quit right now.
Right the fuck now. quit.

1158
01:23:00.455 --> 01:23:02.224
You know that when I'm good.
I'm one of the best

1159
01:23:02.224 --> 01:23:03.457
- in the world.
- You are 271st best

1160
01:23:03.457 --> 01:23:05.155
- in the fucking world.
- I still have a shot.

1161
01:23:05.155 --> 01:23:07.432
You're 31.
You have a better shot
with a handgun in your mouth.

1162
01:23:10.464 --> 01:23:12.764
I mean.
why don't you go home?

1163
01:23:12.764 --> 01:23:15.066
Go home. ask your parents
for a seat on the board.

1164
01:23:15.066 --> 01:23:17.744
or you know what.
matter of fact.
ask them for some money. Okay?

1165
01:23:17.744 --> 01:23:19.311
Go be like
any other spoiled kid

1166
01:23:19.311 --> 01:23:22.241
who has ever
amounted to nothing
in their fucking life.

1167
01:23:22.241 --> 01:23:23.774
and stop this performance

1168
01:23:23.774 --> 01:23:25.443
of being
a down-on-your-luck
professional.

1169
01:23:25.443 --> 01:23:26.745
- Tashi...
- No. you're not

1170
01:23:26.745 --> 01:23:28.682
20 years old anymore.
and it's not cute to be

1171
01:23:28.682 --> 01:23:30.520
walking around pretending
like you need to grind it out

1172
01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:33.120
at these bum-fuck tournaments.
and sleep in your fucking car.

1173
01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:35.589
And it is unforgivable

1174
01:23:35.589 --> 01:23:37.860
that you would ask me
to devote a single second

1175
01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:39.625
of my fucking time

1176
01:23:39.625 --> 01:23:41.359
to help you achieve
your fucking dreams.

1177
01:23:41.359 --> 01:23:43.136
What dreams. Patrick?

1178
01:23:43.802 --> 01:23:44.871
You never had any!

1179
01:23:44.871 --> 01:23:46.135
Is that what
you and Art
are doing?

1180
01:23:46.135 --> 01:23:47.035
- Living the dream?
- That is exactly

1181
01:23:47.035 --> 01:23:48.499
what the fuck we're doing.

1182
01:23:48.499 --> 01:23:50.077
Then how come
you hate him?

1183
01:23:52.743 --> 01:23:54.213
You do.

1184
01:23:55.584 --> 01:23:57.641
It's obvious. you do.

1185
01:23:57.641 --> 01:23:58.985
You can feel him
giving up already.

1186
01:23:58.985 --> 01:24:00.712
even though you know
he's not going to retire

1187
01:24:00.712 --> 01:24:02.615
- until you let him.
- He is a grown man.

1188
01:24:02.615 --> 01:24:04.155
- He can do
whatever he wants.
- Sure. sure.

1189
01:24:04.155 --> 01:24:07.324
but he doesn't.
He does whatever
you want.

1190
01:24:07.324 --> 01:24:10.290
Except now. he's not
even pretending to like it.

1191
01:24:10.290 --> 01:24:12.731
- He's dreaming about

1192
01:24:12.731 --> 01:24:15.002
eating hamburgers again.

1193
01:24:15.002 --> 01:24:16.928
Watching your daughter. um...

1194
01:24:18.397 --> 01:24:19.898
Uh. Lily. grow up.

1195
01:24:19.898 --> 01:24:23.033
Maybe doing some commentary
on the Tennis Channel.

1196
01:24:25.042 --> 01:24:26.542
He's ready to be dead.

1197
01:24:28.607 --> 01:24:29.807
And you're starting to realize

1198
01:24:29.807 --> 01:24:31.250
you might not want
to be buried with him.

1199
01:24:31.250 --> 01:24:34.352
'cause who is he to you
if he's not playing tennis?

1200
01:24:36.683 --> 01:24:38.521
So that's what
you think he is to me?

1201
01:24:39.562 --> 01:24:41.051
A racket and a dick.

1202
01:24:49.068 --> 01:24:50.698
Does Art know
about Atlanta?

1203
01:24:54.936 --> 01:24:57.474
You keep saying you came here
because Art needed matches.

1204
01:24:59.211 --> 01:25:01.038
I think you came
for something else.

1205
01:25:08.579 --> 01:25:09.915
You think
I came here for you?

1206
01:25:12.051 --> 01:25:15.261
You think I came here
to throw it all away for you?

1207
01:25:16.623 --> 01:25:18.165
Maybe you just
wanted to see me.

1208
01:25:18.930 --> 01:25:20.233
I have seen you.

1209
01:25:21.769 --> 01:25:22.961
You look like shit.

1210
01:25:25.905 --> 01:25:27.097
I'm going to beat him.

1211
01:25:30.572 --> 01:25:32.245
If we both
make it to the final.

1212
01:25:33.605 --> 01:25:35.573
I'm going to beat him.

1213
01:25:35.573 --> 01:25:37.107
Even if you could beat him.

1214
01:25:38.314 --> 01:25:39.813
it wouldn't change anything.

1215
01:25:42.121 --> 01:25:44.223
It'll break him.
You know it will.

1216
01:25:44.223 --> 01:25:47.260
It won't make you. Okay?
It's too late for that.

1217
01:25:53.827 --> 01:25:55.329
My number.
in case you
change your mind

1218
01:25:55.329 --> 01:25:56.764
- about the coaching.
- I won't.

1219
01:26:27.994 --> 01:26:29.593
Just text me.
I'll meet you by the car.

1220
01:27:01.998 --> 01:27:02.863
Time.

1221
01:27:10.835 --> 01:27:13.238
Final set.
Zweig to serve.

1222
01:27:13.238 --> 01:27:14.713
Love. one.

1223
01:27:16.074 --> 01:27:18.109
This is it!
Keep it up. champ.

1224
01:27:20.756 --> 01:27:22.289
Come on. man!

1225
01:27:24.422 --> 01:27:26.557
Let's go. let's go. Artie.

1226
01:28:58.948 --> 01:29:01.278
Grab those!
Make sure
that tent is secure.

1227
01:29:14.133 --> 01:29:15.369
Can you do me a favor?

1228
01:29:17.635 --> 01:29:20.198
Can you not. like.
demolish me tomorrow?

1229
01:29:23.602 --> 01:29:25.970
Hey. congrats on being

1230
01:29:25.970 --> 01:29:27.678
a Phil's Tire Town
Challenger finalist.

1231
01:29:28.817 --> 01:29:29.680
Yeah. you too.

1232
01:29:31.178 --> 01:29:32.844
Hopefully.
the wind dies down
before tomorrow

1233
01:29:32.844 --> 01:29:34.380
and we can have
a fair fight.

1234
01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:35.549
Yeah.

1235
01:29:35.549 --> 01:29:39.949
Art. Come on.
Can we talk?

1236
01:29:39.949 --> 01:29:41.793
Can you put
your dick away?

1237
01:29:43.557 --> 01:29:44.860
This is a sauna.

1238
01:29:47.063 --> 01:29:49.059
Look. we've been here
for a week
and we haven't said

1239
01:29:49.059 --> 01:29:51.862
two words to each other.
It's just...

1240
01:29:51.862 --> 01:29:54.572
It's silly. man.
it's dramatic.

1241
01:29:54.572 --> 01:29:58.038
I mean. really.
why are you
so angry with me?

1242
01:30:01.515 --> 01:30:03.747
Look. I don't buy
that it's because of Tashi.

1243
01:30:03.747 --> 01:30:05.880
or I don't think it's because
of what happened to her.

1244
01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:08.852
I think maybe you're still
just really disturbed

1245
01:30:08.852 --> 01:30:12.255
by the fact that she could've
been into someone like me.

1246
01:30:12.255 --> 01:30:14.021
When we were teenagers.

1247
01:30:16.128 --> 01:30:17.123
Huh!

1248
01:30:19.561 --> 01:30:22.165
When we were teenagers.

1249
01:30:22.165 --> 01:30:24.200
<i>...which will be taking place
tomorrow evening.</i>

1250
01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:25.735
<i>He has really been</i>

1251
01:30:25.735 --> 01:30:27.738
<i>in tip-top form this year.
hasn't he. Jason?</i>

1252
01:30:27.738 --> 01:30:29.099
<i>Yeah.
it's actually pretty remarkable</i>

1253
01:30:29.099 --> 01:30:30.909
<i>the difference
we've seen in his game.</i>

1254
01:30:30.909 --> 01:30:33.906
<i>He's far and away
the favorite right now
to win the US Open.</i>

1255
01:30:33.906 --> 01:30:35.612
<i>I completely agree.</i>

1256
01:30:35.612 --> 01:30:37.049
<i>And then. of course.
on the women's side</i>

1257
01:30:37.049 --> 01:30:38.374
<i>we have Anna Mueller.</i>

1258
01:30:38.374 --> 01:30:40.047
<i>who's already got
the Wimbledon title this year.</i>

1259
01:30:40.047 --> 01:30:41.881
<i>She's been having
a great season.</i>

1260
01:30:41.881 --> 01:30:43.921
<i>Absolutely incredible.</i>

1261
01:30:43.921 --> 01:30:46.590
<i>There just hasn't been
really anyone
on the women's side</i>

1262
01:30:46.590 --> 01:30:48.455
<i>who can give her
much of a challenge.</i>

1263
01:30:48.455 --> 01:30:50.227
<i>In the case of Donaldson.
what do you think it is that...</i>

1264
01:31:36.605 --> 01:31:37.808
It's his grandmother's.

1265
01:31:41.344 --> 01:31:42.472
How is she?

1266
01:31:44.115 --> 01:31:45.145
She died.

1267
01:31:46.887 --> 01:31:47.851
Stroke.

1268
01:32:24.255 --> 01:32:25.350
I miss you.

1269
01:32:50.876 --> 01:32:52.712
You're right.

1270
01:32:52.712 --> 01:32:54.186
I do find it disturbing.

1271
01:32:54.186 --> 01:32:55.589
There's no need. man.

1272
01:32:57.192 --> 01:32:58.588
Lots of girls were into me.

1273
01:32:58.588 --> 01:33:00.923
None of them
wanted to marry me.

1274
01:33:00.923 --> 01:33:03.058
- That's not what I was for.
- What were you for?

1275
01:33:19.043 --> 01:33:20.204
<i>You're exactly right. Jason.</i>

1276
01:33:20.204 --> 01:33:22.014
<i>Just to back you up
a little bit...</i>

1277
01:33:22.014 --> 01:33:26.852
<i>His first serve last year
was around 130.
which is excellent.</i>

1278
01:33:26.852 --> 01:33:31.615
<i>But now we're seeing him
get up to 135. 140 sometimes.</i>

1279
01:33:31.615 --> 01:33:33.958
<i>it's giving him a lot more
free points when he serves.</i>

1280
01:33:33.958 --> 01:33:36.459
<i>Yeah. it's just
little things like that...</i>

1281
01:33:36.459 --> 01:33:38.423
Art? Mr. Donaldson?

1282
01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:40.731
Oh. my God.
I can't believe my luck

1283
01:33:40.731 --> 01:33:42.860
that I would run
into you so late at night.

1284
01:33:42.860 --> 01:33:44.297
Um. would you. uh...

1285
01:33:45.997 --> 01:33:47.432
Sure. yeah.

1286
01:33:49.068 --> 01:33:50.067
- There you go.
- Thank you.

1287
01:33:50.067 --> 01:33:51.401
Thank you.
- Thank you.

1288
01:33:51.401 --> 01:33:53.207
<i>The edge
over the opponents.</i>

1289
01:33:53.207 --> 01:33:55.775
<i>That's often the difference
between a good player</i>

1290
01:33:55.775 --> 01:33:57.078
<i>and a great player.</i>

1291
01:33:57.078 --> 01:33:59.618
<i>And I think
Donaldson right now is</i>

1292
01:33:59.618 --> 01:34:01.315
<i>starting to look like
a great player.</i>

1293
01:34:01.315 --> 01:34:03.215
<i>That's for sure.
And I'll be very surprised</i>

1294
01:34:03.215 --> 01:34:04.887
<i>if he doesn't
come away tomorrow...</i>

1295
01:34:04.887 --> 01:34:06.752
Honestly.
I thought you'd be happy

1296
01:34:06.752 --> 01:34:08.321
I was in the draw.

1297
01:34:08.321 --> 01:34:11.397
I mean. you always wanted
to beat me in a tournament.

1298
01:34:11.397 --> 01:34:12.927
and a few weeks
before the Open.

1299
01:34:12.927 --> 01:34:14.732
that's the perfect
confidence booster.

1300
01:34:14.732 --> 01:34:16.668
I know what you're
trying to do right now.

1301
01:34:16.668 --> 01:34:18.296
I'm not trying
to do anything. Art.

1302
01:34:18.296 --> 01:34:20.432
This is a challenger.
I don't need to play

1303
01:34:20.432 --> 01:34:22.506
- mind games with you.
- Right. You don't give a shit.

1304
01:34:22.506 --> 01:34:24.535
I... Hey. I didn't say that.

1305
01:34:26.845 --> 01:34:28.775
We both know you have
considerably more

1306
01:34:28.775 --> 01:34:30.310
at stake here than I do.

1307
01:34:31.813 --> 01:34:33.280
- Do I?

1308
01:34:36.821 --> 01:34:39.459
What the...
Oh. fuck. where do get

1309
01:34:39.459 --> 01:34:42.288
- your swagger from. man?

1310
01:34:42.288 --> 01:34:44.663
I mean. you come in here
swinging your dick around

1311
01:34:44.663 --> 01:34:47.159
like I'm supposed
to be afraid of it. but...

1312
01:34:47.159 --> 01:34:49.467
Do you realize
how embarrassing it is

1313
01:34:49.467 --> 01:34:51.835
that you are here
right now?

1314
01:34:51.835 --> 01:34:53.866
Not quite as embarrassing
as you being here.

1315
01:34:53.866 --> 01:34:55.467
I'm just stopping by. man.

1316
01:34:56.508 --> 01:34:57.909
This is where you live.

1317
01:35:02.215 --> 01:35:04.377
You know...

1318
01:35:04.377 --> 01:35:08.116
I always tried to figure out
what happened to you.

1319
01:35:08.116 --> 01:35:10.388
but. you know. the more
I've thought about it.

1320
01:35:10.388 --> 01:35:12.491
the more I realize...

1321
01:35:12.491 --> 01:35:14.486
It's what didn't happen.

1322
01:35:15.262 --> 01:35:17.061
You never grew up.

1323
01:35:17.061 --> 01:35:19.895
You still think
you can talk to me
like you're my peer.

1324
01:35:19.895 --> 01:35:22.397
because we came
from the same place.

1325
01:35:22.397 --> 01:35:25.266
But it's not about
where you come from
in tennis. Patrick.

1326
01:35:26.406 --> 01:35:27.400
It's about winning.

1327
01:35:28.374 --> 01:35:30.601
And I do. A lot.

1328
01:35:34.042 --> 01:35:37.048
- You've never beaten me.
- So what?

1329
01:35:37.048 --> 01:35:40.380
I haven't beaten
most of the guys
who play at these things.

1330
01:35:40.380 --> 01:35:43.086
This is a game about winning
the points that matter.

1331
01:35:46.117 --> 01:35:47.288
I don't matter?

1332
01:35:51.732 --> 01:35:53.661
Not even to the most
obsessive tennis fan

1333
01:35:53.661 --> 01:35:55.263
in the entire world.

1334
01:35:58.638 --> 01:36:00.070
We're not talking
about tennis.

1335
01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:02.270
What the fuck else do I have
to talk to you about?

1336
01:36:13.219 --> 01:36:15.987
I wanted to come in here
and wish you luck. Art.

1337
01:36:21.725 --> 01:36:23.895
That makes no sense.

1338
01:36:23.895 --> 01:36:25.964
I wanted to say that
I'm looking forward to it.

1339
01:36:27.930 --> 01:36:29.429
And I miss playing with you.

1340
01:36:33.965 --> 01:36:34.808
Yeah.

1341
01:36:37.276 --> 01:36:39.041
Hmm.

1342
01:36:39.041 --> 01:36:42.442
Well. I don't miss
playing with you. man.

1343
01:36:43.483 --> 01:36:44.917
I'm too old for it.

1344
01:36:53.922 --> 01:36:55.251
Kiss for me.

1345
01:36:55.251 --> 01:36:57.120
Thank you. And Grandma.

1346
01:36:57.120 --> 01:36:58.457
Mwah!

1347
01:36:58.457 --> 01:36:59.896
Thanks. sweetheart
- Good night. honey.

1348
01:36:59.896 --> 01:37:01.992
All right.
tuck you both in.

1349
01:37:01.992 --> 01:37:03.898
Oh. there we go.

1350
01:37:03.898 --> 01:37:05.696
Night. sweetheart.

1351
01:37:11.203 --> 01:37:12.208
Good night.

1352
01:37:14.105 --> 01:37:15.342
Thank you.

1353
01:37:15.342 --> 01:37:16.848
What time you want me
to come get her tomorrow?

1354
01:37:16.848 --> 01:37:19.441
I'm saying. whenever.
whenever you want to

1355
01:37:19.441 --> 01:37:20.610
'cause she can
stay with Andrew

1356
01:37:20.610 --> 01:37:22.150
- while we're doing warm-ups.
- Okay. hon.

1357
01:37:22.150 --> 01:37:23.282
And you're talking
to Ralph in the morning?

1358
01:37:23.282 --> 01:37:24.923
Oh. thank...
Yes. I do.
I have that.

1359
01:37:24.923 --> 01:37:27.254
- Okay. Thank you. Mom.
- Okay. sleep tight. okay?

1360
01:37:27.254 --> 01:37:28.753
I love you.
- I love you. sweetie.

1361
01:37:28.753 --> 01:37:30.463
- Have you... Do you have it?
Okay. got my key.

1362
01:37:30.463 --> 01:37:32.088
- Yes. I do. Bye-bye.
- Okay.

1363
01:37:32.088 --> 01:37:33.130
Good night.

1364
01:38:26.444 --> 01:38:27.877
Tell me it doesn't matter.

1365
01:38:33.223 --> 01:38:36.358
Tell me it doesn't matter
if I win tomorrow.

1366
01:38:40.531 --> 01:38:41.528
No.

1367
01:38:45.229 --> 01:38:48.271
You tell me if it matters.
You're the professional
competitor. Art.

1368
01:38:50.702 --> 01:38:52.605
It can't be about
avoiding my judgment.

1369
01:38:55.376 --> 01:38:56.774
I'm not a nun.
I'm not your mommy.

1370
01:38:56.774 --> 01:38:59.046
I'm just asking
that you love me
no matter what.

1371
01:38:59.046 --> 01:39:00.945
What am I. Jesus?

1372
01:39:00.945 --> 01:39:02.054
Yeah.

1373
01:39:08.561 --> 01:39:09.556
You can beat him.

1374
01:39:11.729 --> 01:39:12.889
What if I don't?

1375
01:39:14.393 --> 01:39:15.526
How are you
gonna look at me

1376
01:39:15.526 --> 01:39:17.729
if I still can't beat
Patrick Zweig?

1377
01:39:20.936 --> 01:39:22.107
Just like this.

1378
01:39:34.349 --> 01:39:36.151
I'm going to
say something.

1379
01:39:36.151 --> 01:39:37.815
It's probably gonna
make you angry.

1380
01:39:40.355 --> 01:39:42.259
I need you to
hear me out. okay?

1381
01:39:47.432 --> 01:39:50.795
I wanna retire this year
whether we win the Open or not.

1382
01:39:54.497 --> 01:39:56.042
I'm still going to go for it.

1383
01:39:58.470 --> 01:40:00.178
I'm still going to try. but...

1384
01:40:03.978 --> 01:40:05.183
I'm tired.

1385
01:40:10.190 --> 01:40:12.789
I don't want to be
one of those guys
who doesn't know

1386
01:40:12.789 --> 01:40:14.487
when to walk away. okay?

1387
01:40:14.487 --> 01:40:16.286
It's embarrassing
to still be doing this shit

1388
01:40:16.286 --> 01:40:17.459
when you're 40.

1389
01:40:22.303 --> 01:40:23.498
Okay.

1390
01:40:25.735 --> 01:40:28.307
Okay?

1391
01:40:28.307 --> 01:40:30.709
If you wanna
quit playing tennis.
you can quit playing tennis.

1392
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:32.705
You don't need
my permission.

1393
01:40:57.332 --> 01:40:59.465
We've been
doing this together.

1394
01:40:59.465 --> 01:41:01.401
We've always been
doing this together.

1395
01:41:01.401 --> 01:41:03.502
I'm your coach.
Okay. I work for you.

1396
01:41:03.502 --> 01:41:05.441
- Coach me then.
- I am coaching you.

1397
01:41:08.850 --> 01:41:10.875
I'm playing
for both of us. Tashi.

1398
01:41:12.244 --> 01:41:13.548
I know that.

1399
01:41:21.721 --> 01:41:23.558
If you don't win tomorrow.
I'll leave you.

1400
01:41:28.361 --> 01:41:30.670
I'm serious.
Does that help you?

1401
01:43:35.395 --> 01:43:39.496
Can you just hold me
until I fall asleep. please?

1402
01:43:48.432 --> 01:43:49.440
Okay.

1403
01:46:16.351 --> 01:46:18.523
Advantage. Donaldson.

1404
01:46:31.963 --> 01:46:34.173
Game. Donaldson.

1405
01:46:34.173 --> 01:46:37.735
Donaldson leads
six games to five.

1406
01:47:02.132 --> 01:47:05.568
<i>Phil's Tire Town reminds you
to drink some water.</i>

1407
01:47:05.568 --> 01:47:08.034
<i>Beverages are available
at the snack bar.</i>

1408
01:47:24.081 --> 01:47:25.380
What are you doing?

1409
01:47:25.380 --> 01:47:27.086
I told him
you're an Uber driver.
Just drive.

1410
01:47:53.077 --> 01:47:54.476
I don't wanna be
parked here long.

1411
01:47:54.476 --> 01:47:55.978
Someone's gonna think
I'm a hooker and call the cops.

1412
01:47:55.978 --> 01:47:57.113
We can go back
to my hotel.

1413
01:47:57.113 --> 01:47:58.213
The money just came in
this afternoon.

1414
01:47:58.213 --> 01:47:59.881
I am not here
to fuck you. Patrick.

1415
01:47:59.881 --> 01:48:00.991
- You're not?
- No.

1416
01:48:00.991 --> 01:48:02.022
Uh.

1417
01:48:03.030 --> 01:48:04.926
- Well?

1418
01:48:09.994 --> 01:48:11.629
I want you
to lose tomorrow.

1419
01:48:11.629 --> 01:48:13.000
I'm aware of that.

1420
01:48:16.001 --> 01:48:18.434
I'm asking you
to lose tomorrow.

1421
01:48:26.710 --> 01:48:27.652
Fuck off.

1422
01:48:29.488 --> 01:48:31.815
He's doing really well
this week.

1423
01:48:31.815 --> 01:48:32.918
He's ready to come back.

1424
01:48:32.918 --> 01:48:34.184
He's ready to
make a shot at the Open.

1425
01:48:34.184 --> 01:48:35.660
and if he wins tomorrow.
he'll know he can do it.

1426
01:48:37.228 --> 01:48:38.129
He needs this.

1427
01:48:38.129 --> 01:48:39.994
- He needs this?
- Yes.

1428
01:48:41.794 --> 01:48:43.129
What about what I need?

1429
01:48:45.462 --> 01:48:47.969
I can't believe
you'd do this to him.

1430
01:48:48.842 --> 01:48:49.971
I mean.

1431
01:48:51.168 --> 01:48:52.673
fucking me
would be one thing.

1432
01:48:52.673 --> 01:48:54.809
but this?
This is unforgivable.

1433
01:48:54.809 --> 01:48:56.379
Actually. I'm being
incredibly fucking kind

1434
01:48:56.379 --> 01:48:57.881
to the both of you right now.

1435
01:48:57.881 --> 01:49:00.553
Okay?
I'm taking such good care
of my little white boys.

1436
01:49:02.056 --> 01:49:03.850
No. No fucking way.

1437
01:49:03.850 --> 01:49:06.389
Drive me back
to my fucking hotel.

1438
01:49:06.389 --> 01:49:07.891
Drive the fucking car. Patrick.

1439
01:49:07.891 --> 01:49:09.187
Hey. you know what the most
frustrating part of this is?

1440
01:49:09.187 --> 01:49:10.723
- What?
- You know what really
drives me crazy?

1441
01:49:10.723 --> 01:49:11.723
You did come here to fuck me.

1442
01:49:11.723 --> 01:49:13.322
but you're so full of shit

1443
01:49:13.322 --> 01:49:15.198
that you won't
even admit that to yourself.

1444
01:49:15.198 --> 01:49:17.229
If it's the only way
to get you to throw
the fucking match. then sure.

1445
01:49:18.434 --> 01:49:20.071
Go fuck yourself.

1446
01:49:20.071 --> 01:49:21.535
You absolute loser.

1447
01:49:21.535 --> 01:49:22.902
I'm the loser?

1448
01:49:22.902 --> 01:49:25.140
Yeah.
Yeah. you are.
Look at you.

1449
01:49:25.140 --> 01:49:27.206
Time for your Uber driver
to drop you back off
to your family.

1450
01:49:41.687 --> 01:49:42.595
Thirty. love.

1451
01:49:45.231 --> 01:49:46.093
Come on. Art.

1452
01:49:51.372 --> 01:49:53.903
- Unbelievable.
- I know. Let's go!

1453
01:50:11.488 --> 01:50:12.658
Fuck it. I'll do it.

1454
01:50:14.922 --> 01:50:16.087
- Why?
- What do you mean. why?

1455
01:50:16.087 --> 01:50:17.254
Because I want you
to actually do it.

1456
01:50:17.254 --> 01:50:19.097
so I need to know
that you understand why--

1457
01:50:19.097 --> 01:50:21.194
I'm not married to you. Tashi.
Just be happy
I'm doing what you want

1458
01:50:21.194 --> 01:50:23.464
- and shut up about it.
- You are such a fucking child.

1459
01:50:23.464 --> 01:50:25.132
Of course I am.

1460
01:50:25.132 --> 01:50:27.904
I spent my entire life
hitting a ball with a racket.

1461
01:50:29.508 --> 01:50:32.071
Why the fuck
am I in your car?

1462
01:50:32.071 --> 01:50:33.536
- Because you're stupid.
- You're stupid.

1463
01:50:33.536 --> 01:50:36.307
I know. I'm just not
as disturbed by it
as you are.

1464
01:50:36.307 --> 01:50:38.713
I don't have nearly that
high an opinion of myself.

1465
01:50:38.713 --> 01:50:40.310
You are the most
egotistical person

1466
01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:42.587
- I have ever met in my life.
- Oh. sure. sure.

1467
01:50:42.587 --> 01:50:44.081
But I've never been
confused about the fact

1468
01:50:44.081 --> 01:50:45.785
- that I'm a piece of shit.

1469
01:50:45.785 --> 01:50:46.886
That's what you like
about me.

1470
01:50:46.886 --> 01:50:48.219
I don't like
anything about you.

1471
01:50:48.219 --> 01:50:49.791
No. you like precisely
one thing about me

1472
01:50:49.791 --> 01:50:51.091
and it's that
I'm such a piece of shit

1473
01:50:51.091 --> 01:50:52.922
that I could actually see you
for what you are.

1474
01:50:52.922 --> 01:50:54.166
And what is that?

1475
01:50:54.166 --> 01:50:56.801
In reality? A really.

1476
01:50:58.668 --> 01:51:00.496
really insanely hot woman.

1477
01:51:00.496 --> 01:51:03.267
- Oh. fuck off.
- I guess now
you'd say a MILF.

1478
01:51:03.267 --> 01:51:05.003
- Pull over.
- Come on. don't be dramatic.

1479
01:51:05.003 --> 01:51:06.236
Pull the fucking
car over. Patrick.

1480
01:51:06.236 --> 01:51:08.178
- Fine. let me... Fine.
- Pull over.

1481
01:51:18.117 --> 01:51:21.186
Hey! Hey!
Your hotel's that way!

1482
01:51:39.304 --> 01:51:41.406
Are you gonna
hit me again. huh?

1483
01:55:06.513 --> 01:55:08.448
<i>I miss
watching you play. Tashi.</i>

1484
01:55:09.918 --> 01:55:11.550
<i>You're so beautiful.</i>

1485
01:55:14.291 --> 01:55:16.720
You have to make him feel
like he earned it tomorrow.

1486
01:55:19.065 --> 01:55:21.395
You can't just give up
in the middle of the match.

1487
01:55:24.595 --> 01:55:26.532
Are you sure
this is what you want?

1488
01:55:30.367 --> 01:55:31.801
What else could I want?

1489
01:55:41.417 --> 01:55:43.780
How am I supposed to know
if you're going to do it?

1490
01:55:46.491 --> 01:55:47.652
You won't.

1491
01:56:03.138 --> 01:56:04.540
All right.
Come on!

1492
01:56:38.639 --> 01:56:40.672
Thirty. forty.

1493
01:56:48.956 --> 01:56:50.880
All right.
Hang in there.

1494
01:56:52.382 --> 01:56:53.520
Let's go!

1495
01:56:55.725 --> 01:56:58.124
Yes. that's it. that's it!
Come on. Patrick.

1496
01:56:58.124 --> 01:56:59.996
Yes. yes. the deuce!

1497
01:56:59.996 --> 01:57:00.989
All right!
Yes!

1498
01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:24.118
Donaldson! Let's go!

1499
01:57:24.118 --> 01:57:25.689
Blame it on the court!

1500
01:57:25.689 --> 01:57:27.587
Whoo!

1501
01:57:54.514 --> 01:57:56.179
Fault!

1502
01:58:02.752 --> 01:58:04.228
Come on. get back in it.

1503
01:58:07.359 --> 01:58:10.102
No! Zweig!

1504
01:58:20.870 --> 01:58:23.148
Come on!
Whoo. whoo!

1505
01:58:55.609 --> 01:58:57.743
Come on. Patrick. let's play!

1506
01:59:32.876 --> 01:59:35.446
Time violation.
Warning. Zweig.

1507
02:00:53.698 --> 02:00:54.831
Deuce!

1508
02:01:32.268 --> 02:01:34.339
- Fuck off!

1509
02:01:35.769 --> 02:01:38.238
Code violation.
audible obscenity.

1510
02:01:38.238 --> 02:01:40.345
Point penalty. Donaldson.

1511
02:01:41.409 --> 02:01:42.743
Advantage. Zweig.

1512
02:02:12.810 --> 02:02:13.972
Art?

1513
02:02:18.675 --> 02:02:20.044
He can serve.

1514
02:02:20.977 --> 02:02:22.578
You need to
get into position.

1515
02:02:26.126 --> 02:02:27.854
Come on. Art.
Let's go!

1516
02:02:40.635 --> 02:02:42.473
Serve.

1517
02:03:02.857 --> 02:03:04.924
Game. Zweig.

1518
02:03:05.998 --> 02:03:07.993
Final set. tie break.

1519
02:03:15.768 --> 02:03:17.132
Come on.
let's do this.

1520
02:03:17.132 --> 02:03:20.236
Let's close it out.
Let's close it out. baby.

1521
02:06:55.488 --> 02:06:56.958
Come on!

1522
02:06:59.999 --> 02:07:01.424
Ah!
