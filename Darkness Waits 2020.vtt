and I applaud the effort.

1630
01:34:07.224 --> 01:34:09.661
But the difference
between wild speculations

1631
01:34:09.685 --> 01:34:12.688
and hard concrete evidence
in this case is vast.

1632
01:34:14.065 --> 01:34:15.834
The was we have to assess this...

1633
01:34:15.858 --> 01:34:16.209
[Thud]

1634
01:34:16.233 --> 01:34:17.233
- Ballistics.

1635
01:34:18.986 --> 01:34:20.988
- Travis's gun was registered
to his father.

1636
01:34:21.781 --> 01:34:22.781
I read the report.

1637
01:34:23.115 --> 01:34:25.534
So you read that
his gun was never fired.

1638
01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:28.162
It's factory new out of the box.

1639
01:34:30.581 --> 01:34:32.267
Look the big bad wolf is still out there.

1640
01:34:32.291 --> 01:34:35.503
And you're acting like the mayor of
Amity Island who won't close the beaches.

1641
01:34:36.212 --> 01:34:38.214
- This case is as good as closed.

1642
01:34:38.923 --> 01:34:40.508
You just have to make it so.

1643
01:34:41.133 --> 01:34:42.927
- Instead you choose
to drag it out.

1644
01:34:43.761 --> 01:34:45.930
As if the victims families
haven't suffered enough.

1645
01:34:47.932 --> 01:34:49.934
Days become years.

1646
01:34:50.768 --> 01:34:51.769
And for what?

1647
01:34:53.104 --> 01:34:55.707
The big bad wolf
isn't going anywhere.

1648
01:34:55.731 --> 01:34:56.731
That's a fact.

1649
01:34:57.942 --> 01:35:00.152
And nothing you can do can change that.

1650
01:35:02.363 --> 01:35:03.906
- He's been there from the beginning.

1651
01:35:04.865 --> 01:35:06.075
- And no matter what you do

1652
01:35:07.201 --> 01:35:09.179
The big bad wolf
always gonna be there Buck.

1653
01:35:09.203 --> 01:35:10.746
You have to wrap
your head around that.

1654
01:35:12.248 --> 01:35:13.488
- What the people don't know...

1655
01:35:15.334 --> 01:35:16.062
won't hurt them.

1656
01:35:16.086 --> 01:35:17.670
That's the way it's always been Buck.

1657
01:35:19.755 --> 01:35:22.025
- Because rest assured.
I'm not going to be made a fool of again.

1658
01:35:22.049 --> 01:35:23.049
You understand me?

1659
01:35:30.391 --> 01:35:31.684
Now what's it gonna be?

1660
01:35:39.483 --> 01:35:41.485
[ dramatic music ]

1661
01:35:42.027 --> 01:35:44.029
- Where the hell do you
think you are going?

1662
01:35:45.364 --> 01:35:46.508
Is it your turn.

1663
01:35:46.532 --> 01:35:49.177
to beat an innocent man
with a baseball bat.

1664
01:35:49.201 --> 01:35:51.704
in the name of vigilante justice?

1665
01:35:54.331 --> 01:35:56.727
You keep walking out that door
and turn your back on me

1666
01:35:56.751 --> 01:35:58.043
and you're finished!

1667
01:35:58.461 --> 01:35:59.461
You hear that?

1668
01:36:00.212 --> 01:36:01.338
You're finished!

1669
01:36:03.048 --> 01:36:04.508
You know what
your problem is Mayor?

1670
01:36:05.676 --> 01:36:07.916
You still think there is such a thing
as innocent people.

1671

[ dramatic music ]

1672
01:36:27.031 --> 01:36:29.783
(Reporter) Sheriff. whats going
on? What did the mayor say?

1673
01:37:08.572 --> 01:37:11.408
