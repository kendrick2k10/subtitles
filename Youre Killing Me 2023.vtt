[Boy in recording] What is it?

00:00:45.523 --> 00:00:47.134
[Girl in recording] Can
you stop filming me?

00:00:47.177 --> 00:00:48.265
[Boy] Yeah.

00:00:50.137 --> 00:00:52.139

Settle down. class?

13
00:01:10.548 --> 00:01:12.289
Thank you.

14
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:14.074
We have a guest here that
would like to talk to you

15
00:01:14.117 --> 00:01:16.598
about a very important issue.

16
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.774
-Detective Mitchell?
-Thank you.

17
00:01:18.817 --> 00:01:20.210
Hi everyone.

18
00:01:20.254 --> 00:01:21.472
I'm investigating
the disappearance

19
00:01:21.515 --> 00:01:23.648
of your classmate.
Melissa Brown.

20
00:01:23.692 --> 00:01:25.476
A daughter. a sister.

21
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.565
and a dear friend
of many of you.

22
00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:29.393
This case has been
frustrating and heartbreaking

23
00:01:29.437 --> 00:01:30.873
for all concerned.

24
00:01:30.916 --> 00:01:32.744
Unfortunately. at this
point in the case.

25
00:01:32.788 --> 00:01:34.485
we suspect foul play.

26
00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:36.922
Any detail could be
vitally important

27
00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:38.315
in helping us locate her.

28
00:01:38.663 --> 00:01:40.187
[Teacher] And as always.
Counselor Fink's office

29
00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.190

guys need to talk.

30
00:01:43.233 --> 00:01:44.452
Okay?

31
00:01:44.495 --> 00:01:45.235
Notebooks out.

00:02:29.453 --> 00:02:31.151
You know this girl?

37
00:02:35.807 --> 00:02:37.200
Hey. Schroder.

38
00:02:39.071 --> 00:02:40.247
What's up?

39
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.336
Hey. so this is
kind of awkward.

40
00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.122
but your dad is on the
board at Penbrook. right?

41
00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:48.603
You want me to put in a good
word for you. don't you?

42
00:02:48.646 --> 00:02:50.430
Someone else already
asked you to do that?

43
00:02:50.474 --> 00:02:52.128
Yeah. just you and every other

44
00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:54.565
scholarship kid at this school.

45
00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.873
Well. difference is I'm
actually just wait listed.

46
00:02:57.916 --> 00:02:59.527
So. I was thinking
maybe if your dad

47
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.181
could write me a letter
of recommendation

48
00:03:01.224 --> 00:03:02.356
that would help swing
things in my favor?

49
00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:04.096
Yeah. that's not
really how this works.

50
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.534
but I wouldn't expect
you to understand that.

51
00:03:06.577 --> 00:03:08.492
I mean. we barely
even know each other.

52
00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:13.193
We've been in every class
together since freshman year.

53
00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:15.934
Right. Uh...

54
00:03:15.978 --> 00:03:18.459
Maybe you should just
call my dad's office.

55
00:03:18.502 --> 00:03:20.287
I have tried. multiple times.

56
00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.637
His secretary just keeps
telling me that he's busy.

57
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.552
So I thought--

58
00:03:24.595 --> 00:03:25.335
There you go.

59
00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:26.510
He's a busy guy.

60
00:03:26.554 --> 00:03:28.033
His dad's a fucking
congressman. bro.

61
00:03:28.077 --> 00:03:29.470
-[Shroder] Busy guy.
-What the fuck do you expect?

62
00:03:29.513 --> 00:03:31.472
Hey. are you still having your

63
00:03:31.515 --> 00:03:33.213
Heaven and Hell party tonight?

64
00:03:34.605 --> 00:03:36.390
Do you see this man's face?

65
00:03:36.433 --> 00:03:38.392
Yeah. it's to be expected.

66
00:03:39.915 --> 00:03:41.829
[Kendra] It's a theme party. in
case you didn't catch that.

67
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.353
[car starting up. doors closing]

68
00:03:52.057 --> 00:03:53.058
Hey.

69
00:03:53.537 --> 00:03:54.321
Hey.

70
00:03:55.365 --> 00:03:56.497
Well. what was that?

71
00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.935
Um. we're gonna go to
a party tonight.

72
00:03:59.978 --> 00:04:01.415
-His party?
-Yeah.

73
00:04:01.458 --> 00:04:02.416
Yeah. no way am I going.

74
00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.418
Yes. it's gonna be fun.

75
00:04:04.461 --> 00:04:05.245
We hate fun.

76
00:04:05.288 --> 00:04:06.289
Well. this...

77
00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:10.598
Is this about Penbrook?

78
00:04:10.641 --> 00:04:12.208
Okay. so what's your plan?

79
00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:14.341
You're gonna. what. use
Schroder to get to his dad?

80
00:04:14.384 --> 00:04:15.777
I don't know. I don't know.

81
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.430
I don't know. this
might be my only chance.

82
00:04:17.474 --> 00:04:19.128
and you're not gonna
leave me behind.

83
00:04:19.171 --> 00:04:20.695
Of course not. but
we're not even invited.

84
00:04:20.738 --> 00:04:23.393
You don't have to be invited
to a high school party.

85
00:04:23.437 --> 00:04:26.135
you just show up...um.

86
00:04:26.178 --> 00:04:27.528
in themed costumes.

87
00:04:27.571 --> 00:04:28.355
[Zara] Nope!

88
00:04:29.225 --> 00:04:31.575
[tense music]

89
00:05:20.537 --> 00:05:21.843
[Dad] That's your
Mama's coat. isn't it?

90
00:05:23.714 --> 00:05:24.498
Huh.

91
00:05:25.673 --> 00:05:27.457
Are your girls
cold or something?

92
00:05:27.501 --> 00:05:30.591
Actually. I like my
body being covered up.

93
00:05:30.634 --> 00:05:31.418
Thank you.

94
00:05:33.376 --> 00:05:36.858
[Dad] All right.
Zara. [chuckles]

95
00:05:36.901 --> 00:05:39.164
Y'all are in the fancy part
of town. I'll tell you what.

96
00:05:39.207 --> 00:05:40.514
Why don't you hand
out some of these

97
00:05:40.557 --> 00:05:41.602
business cards for
me at the party?

98
00:05:42.429 --> 00:05:43.386
Dad.

99
00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:45.562
Actually. you can
just pull over.

100
00:05:45.606 --> 00:05:46.824
Right here's fine.

101
00:05:46.868 --> 00:05:49.436
[Dad] Mess up this
guy's grass. [laughing]

102
00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:50.480
[Eden] Dad. stop.

103
00:05:50.524 --> 00:05:52.569
Dad. Dad. stop.
stop. stop. stop.

104
00:05:52.613 --> 00:05:54.005
-Stop. okay.
-[Dad] I stopped!

105
00:05:54.049 --> 00:05:55.267
[Eden] Thank you.

106
00:05:55.311 --> 00:05:56.530
[Zara] Thanks for
the ride. Mr. Murphy.

107
00:05:56.573 --> 00:05:57.792
[Dad] You're welcome. darling.

108
00:05:57.835 --> 00:05:59.141
Y'all have fun.

109
00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:01.186
[Zara] Okay.

110
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.100
-For you?
-Oh. god.

111
00:06:02.144 --> 00:06:03.101
You actually bought them.

112
00:06:03.145 --> 00:06:04.407
[Eden] Oh. Dad?

113
00:06:04.451 --> 00:06:05.800
Hey. what are you doing?

114
00:06:05.843 --> 00:06:07.192
[Dad groans] I'm just gonna
walk you over there.

115
00:06:07.236 --> 00:06:08.542
[Eden] No. it's okay.
Dad. it's okay. your back.

116
00:06:08.585 --> 00:06:09.978
I don't want you to
strain your back.

117
00:06:10.021 --> 00:06:11.283
[Dad] I want you to be safe.

118
00:06:11.327 --> 00:06:12.415
[Eden] It's okay. it's
just. it's right there.

119
00:06:12.459 --> 00:06:13.460
We'll be fine.

120
00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:15.723
All right. you win.

121
00:06:17.812 --> 00:06:19.770
[Eden] Thank you.

122
00:06:19.814 --> 00:06:21.381
Okay. well. we'll call you.

123
00:06:22.643 --> 00:06:23.426
I know.

124
00:06:24.862 --> 00:06:26.734
'Cause if you don't.
I'm rolling right up

125
00:06:26.777 --> 00:06:29.214
to the front door
in my baby here.

126
00:06:29.258 --> 00:06:30.694
[Eden] God. I hate how
much you love this car.

127
00:06:30.738 --> 00:06:31.739
[Dad laughing]

128
00:06:31.782 --> 00:06:33.436
Okay. we'll call. Bye!

129
00:06:34.568 --> 00:06:37.005
Not as much as I love you.

130
00:06:37.788 --> 00:06:39.050
The wings look good!

131
00:06:39.094 --> 00:06:41.749
-Black is a nice touch.
-Yeah. I like them.

132
00:06:41.792 --> 00:06:44.099
[Zara] So excited. you know?

133
00:06:44.142 --> 00:06:46.449
[Eden] I can hear your sarcasm.

134
00:06:46.493 --> 00:06:48.408
[Zara] I cannot believe
you're making me do this.

135
00:06:48.451 --> 00:06:49.713
[Eden] It's not
gonna be as bad--

136
00:06:49.757 --> 00:06:51.367
I mean. look at them.
they're already leaving.

137
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:52.412
Clearly it sucks.

138
00:06:52.455 --> 00:06:53.500
[Eden chuckles] No.

139
00:06:53.761 --> 00:06:54.544
-Zara--
-Please.

140
00:06:54.588 --> 00:06:55.806
Come on. Eden. seriously.

141
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.112
Look at this fucking house!

142
00:06:57.155 --> 00:06:58.505
[Eden] Listen to me. okay?

143
00:06:58.548 --> 00:07:00.985
I have a plan. and it's
gonna go so smoothly.

144
00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:04.685
and we'll be super fast. and
if while we're here. you know.

145
00:07:04.728 --> 00:07:05.816
Schroder decides
that we're besties

146
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.427
and he wants to
introduce me to his dad.

147
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:08.602
and then I get to go
to Penbrook with you.

148
00:07:08.645 --> 00:07:11.039
then all this is worth it.

149
00:07:11.082 --> 00:07:13.694
You really think that
you're gonna become besties

150
00:07:13.737 --> 00:07:15.217
in one fucking night?

151
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.523
Schroder sucks.

152
00:07:16.566 --> 00:07:18.002
-Listen--
-Schroder sucks.

153
00:07:18.046 --> 00:07:19.395
I know he does.

154
00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:20.918
But here's. okay--

155
00:07:20.962 --> 00:07:23.965
Let's maybe not look at how
everybody else is dressed.

156
00:07:24.008 --> 00:07:27.490
No. listen. it's all
gonna work out. okay?

157
00:07:27.534 --> 00:07:28.578
And we're gonna be
roommates next year.

158
00:07:28.622 --> 00:07:30.493
We just have to do this.

159
00:07:30.537 --> 00:07:31.755
It's gonna be great.

160
00:07:31.799 --> 00:07:34.062
I swear I have a plan
and it's gonna be

161
00:07:34.105 --> 00:07:35.542
so quick. and then
we can leave.

162
00:07:35.585 --> 00:07:38.153
[Zara] You're so good at
being so manipulative.

163
00:07:38.501 --> 00:07:40.982
[upbeat music
playing on speakers]

164
00:07:43.245 --> 00:07:44.986
[Zara laughing]

165
00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:45.900
Nope.

166
00:07:45.943 --> 00:07:47.205
No. no. no. please. please.

167
00:07:47.249 --> 00:07:48.511
-Eden.
-Yeah.

168
00:07:48.555 --> 00:07:49.947
We're just gonna be here
for like five minutes.

169
00:07:49.991 --> 00:07:50.731
Okay?

170
00:07:50.774 --> 00:07:51.688
This will be so fast.

171
00:07:51.732 --> 00:07:52.515
Hey. yo.

172
00:07:54.299 --> 00:07:56.345
Phones go in the box.

173
00:07:56.388 --> 00:07:57.564
Why?

174
00:07:57.607 --> 00:08:00.958
Congressman
Schroder lives here.

175
00:08:01.002 --> 00:08:02.612
You really think we'd
be throwing a party?

176
00:08:02.656 --> 00:08:05.354
Here. I'll just. can you put
your phone in there. please?

177
00:08:05.397 --> 00:08:07.008
You coming in or not?

178
00:08:07.051 --> 00:08:08.749
I hate you.

179

[both chuckling]

225
00:10:47.385 --> 00:10:49.823
Only way I'm getting into
college is if my dad donates

like a million dollars.
which is not gonna happen.

227
00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.658

Let me show you something.

284

That's what I gotta live up to.

285

If I don't become
president. I'll basically

286

be considered a fuck-up.

287
00:14:22.296 --> 00:14:25.168
Well. just become
president then. right?

288
00:14:25.212 --> 00:14:26.909
Can't be that hard.

289
00:14:28.911 --> 00:14:29.694
Okay.

290
00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.785
Ah. you're killing me.

291
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:34.874
Killing me.

292
00:14:38.965 --> 00:14:40.444
When my family
first landed here.

293
00:14:40.488 --> 00:14:41.793
a native chief gave that to my

294
00:14:41.837 --> 00:14:44.187
great-great-great grandfather.

295
00:14:48.365 --> 00:14:49.149
Right.

296
00:14:54.981 --> 00:14:55.764
See this?

297
00:14:59.115 --> 00:15:02.466
My great grandfather stole
this from a German soldier

298
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:04.729
he killed in World War II.

299
00:15:05.817 --> 00:15:06.818

My dad?

305
00:15:26.186 --> 00:15:30.103
You're really determined
to use me. aren't you?

306
00:15:36.022 --> 00:15:36.848
Hmm.

307
00:15:42.811 --> 00:15:44.160
What's your pitch?

308
00:15:48.121 --> 00:15:50.514
Penbrook has been
my dream school

309
00:15:50.558 --> 00:15:53.169
for as long as I can remember.

I mean. I've had no help.

313

I don't come from money.

314
00:16:01.003 --> 00:16:03.005
I haven't had any tutors.

315
00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:05.181
I couldn't afford SAT prep.

316
00:16:05.225 --> 00:16:09.011
I mean. Schroder. I
have done all of this

317
00:16:09.055 --> 00:16:11.057
completely on my own.
and I'm just wait-listed.

318
00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.145

You said you've done it
completely on your own.

323
00:16:26.072 --> 00:16:28.204
If I did hear correctly.
and that's not true.

00:26:32.808 --> 00:26:34.418
It's not like she's
got the passcode.

[Gooch chuckling nervously]

544

554
00:27:16.809 --> 00:27:19.855
Schroder. do your parents
have a charger in here?

555
00:27:30.997 --> 00:27:32.738
Did the phone die or something?

556
00:27:32.781 --> 00:27:34.217
I just wanna charge
it up so I can

557
00:27:34.261 --> 00:27:35.915
call my dad to
come pick us up.

558
00:27:35.958 --> 00:27:37.090

559
00:27:37.133 --> 00:27:39.570
Yes. I think that's
a wonderful idea.

560
00:27:39.614 --> 00:27:41.224
Come on out. we'll
give you your phone

561

so you can call your dad.

562
00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.055
I don't wanna leave
Zara in here by herself.

563
00:27:46.099 --> 00:27:47.491
so why don't you just

564
00:27:47.535 --> 00:27:49.580
give me the phone charger
under the door.

565
00:27:49.624 --> 00:27:52.061

Let me help.

[Schroder clears throat]

569
00:27:59.634 --> 00:28:00.983
Yeah. that'd be a little
weird though. right?

570
00:28:01.027 --> 00:28:03.116
To give you a charger
when you could just

571
00:28:03.159 --> 00:28:05.640
come out here and
get your phone.

572
00:28:05.684 --> 00:28:06.772

00:28:20.089 --> 00:28:20.873
Stop.

00:28:23.005 --> 00:28:23.745

581
00:28:31.797 --> 00:28:34.713
I saw you with
Melissa on Friday.

582
00:28:35.801 --> 00:28:37.324
I thought you said
the phone died.

583
00:28:37.367 --> 00:28:38.629
It did.

584
00:28:38.673 --> 00:28:39.805
So you didn't see
the whole video.

585
00:28:39.848 --> 00:28:41.807

00:28:43.722 --> 00:28:44.810
Schroder. where is she?

587
00:28:47.595 --> 00:28:50.903
The last time that
we saw Melissa Brown

588
00:28:53.383 --> 00:28:55.908
is when we dropped
her off at her house.

I swear to God.

590
00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:02.001
Okay. if that's the truth.
then give me a charger

591
00:29:02.044 --> 00:29:03.567
and let me finish
watching the video.

592
00:29:03.611 --> 00:29:06.353
I'm not sliding a charger
under the door. even though--

593
00:29:06.396 --> 00:29:08.877
I'm not leaving this
room until you give me

594
00:29:08.921 --> 00:29:11.793
a charger and I finish
watching the video.

595
00:29:11.837 --> 00:29:14.535
I think you're gonna think
this is all really silly

596
00:29:14.578 --> 00:29:16.798
once you see this video.

597

598

Charge up the phone.
give you your phone.

599

the video together. okay?

Zara. are you not listening?

1047

They were with her the
night that she disappeared.

So?

1049
00:52:59.654 --> 00:53:02.222
That doesn't prove anything.

1050
00:53:02.266 --> 00:53:03.745
It proves that they
lied to the cops

1051
00:53:03.789 --> 00:53:06.183
and that they
know where she is.

1052
00:53:06.226 --> 00:53:07.271
You don't know that for sure.

1053
00:53:07.314 --> 00:53:08.359

00:53:10.099 --> 00:53:11.666
-Are you serious?
-Look.

If this is what
you think it is.

1056
00:53:13.407 --> 00:53:15.496
we're not getting out until
we give them that phone.

1057
00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:16.802
I know.

1058
00:53:16.845 --> 00:53:18.282
That's why this is
going to the police.

1059
00:53:18.325 --> 00:53:20.980
No. we have to give
it back to them.

1060
00:53:21.023 --> 00:53:22.634
Look. we can tell
the police ourselves.

1061
00:53:22.677 --> 00:53:25.680

get the fuck out of here.

Who are we?

1067
00:53:36.691 --> 00:53:39.868
You really think anyone's
gonna believe us over them?

1068
00:53:39.912 --> 00:53:42.349
This is the only chance
we have to help find her.

1069
00:53:42.393 --> 00:53:44.003
We have to take
this to the police.

1070

Eden.

1071
00:53:45.918 --> 00:53:47.311

Zara. please. that is
the only proof we have.

1101

I don't care about proof.

1102
00:56:06.319 --> 00:56:07.451

-What's going on here?
-[Shroder] Dad.

1136
00:57:49.117 --> 00:57:51.729
I didn't think you were
gonna be home until Sunday.

1137
00:57:51.772 --> 00:57:53.557
Well. your mother
wasn't feeling well.

1138
00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:56.081
You need to explain everything
that's happening now.

1139
00:57:56.124 --> 00:57:56.864
Right now.

1140
00:57:56.908 --> 00:57:58.126
Yes.

1141
00:57:58.170 --> 00:58:00.738

were just having
little get-together.

1143
00:58:02.783 --> 00:58:05.830
and things got out of
hand. but I've got it all

1144
00:58:05.873 --> 00:58:07.614
under control now.
everything's cool.

1145
00:58:07.658 --> 00:58:09.007
it's all cool.
everything's cool.

1146
00:58:09.050 --> 00:58:11.270
No. everything is definitely
not cool. young man.

1147
00:58:44.259 --> 00:58:47.567
I just think we all need
to take a deep breath.

1148
00:58:47.611 --> 00:58:49.961
Are you fucking shitting me?

1149
00:59:00.537 --> 00:59:01.276
It's her fault.

1150
00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:02.277
She started all of this.

1151
00:59:02.321 --> 00:59:04.366
She stole Gooch's phone and...

1152
00:59:04.410 --> 00:59:05.280
Her fault?

1153
00:59:05.324 --> 00:59:06.717
-Her fault?
-[Shroder] Yes.

1154
00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:08.414
When I walked into
this mad house.

1155
00:59:08.457 --> 00:59:10.285
you were chasing my
daughter around with an ax!

1156
00:59:10.329 --> 00:59:11.765
Mr. Murphy.

1157
00:59:11.809 --> 00:59:15.160
I'm happy we have this
opportunity to talk this over.

1158
00:59:15.203 --> 00:59:16.335
[Joel] Talk?

1159
00:59:16.378 --> 00:59:18.163
You better start
explaining a few things.

1160
00:59:18.206 --> 00:59:20.600
or I'm gonna go talk
to the cops. all right?

1161
00:59:20.644 --> 00:59:23.821
Oh. [laughing]

1162
00:59:23.864 --> 00:59:25.083
Not necessary.

1163
00:59:25.126 --> 00:59:27.215
How did this get so out
of control. Barrett?

1164
00:59:27.259 --> 00:59:28.826
I was just trying to
protect you. that's all.

1165
00:59:28.869 --> 00:59:30.654
I know this is a big year with
the election and everything.

1166
00:59:30.697 --> 00:59:32.220
and I just didn't--

1167
00:59:32.264 --> 00:59:35.615
The only person he's been
trying to protect is himself.

1168
00:59:35.659 --> 00:59:37.486
I've seen the video.

1169
00:59:37.530 --> 00:59:38.879
Dad. don't listen to her--

1170
00:59:38.923 --> 00:59:40.794
[Eden] Did you know he has
a video on his phone?

1171
00:59:40.838 --> 00:59:42.056

Of Melissa Brown being
forced into his car

she disappeared?

[Joel] Whoa. whoa.
whoa. whoa. whoa.

1175
00:59:47.018 --> 00:59:48.802
What's this got
to do with that?

1176
00:59:48.846 --> 00:59:50.108
What?

1177
00:59:50.151 --> 00:59:52.545
Gooch. Gooch. come on.
talk to my parents.

1178
00:59:52.589 --> 00:59:54.068
Tell them the truth.
You know what happened.

1179
00:59:54.112 --> 00:59:56.114
[Eden] What happened. Schroder?

1180
00:59:56.941 --> 00:59:57.942
[Shroder] Tell them.

1181
00:59:59.117 --> 01:00:00.814
It is your phone. Gooch.

1182
01:00:00.858 --> 01:00:02.033
Gooch?

1183
01:00:02.076 --> 01:00:02.773
Why don't you just
tell us what's on it?

1184
01:00:02.816 --> 01:00:03.861
Why don't you?

1185
01:00:05.776 --> 01:00:06.777
[Shroder] Tell them.

1186
01:00:07.865 --> 01:00:09.257
Fucking tell them.

1187
01:00:11.346 --> 01:00:12.783
Fucking pussy. goddamn.

1188
01:00:12.826 --> 01:00:15.046
Why don't you find
a charger for that?

1189
01:00:15.089 --> 01:00:18.049
Watch the video yourselves.

1190
01:00:18.092 --> 01:00:20.138
Good luck getting
into Penbrook. bitch.

1191
01:00:20.181 --> 01:00:21.618
[Astrid] Oh. excuse me?

1192
01:00:22.531 --> 01:00:23.402
-Did you-
-Barrett.

1193
01:00:23.445 --> 01:00:24.533
Excuse me?

1194
01:00:24.577 --> 01:00:25.926
Did you not hear him?

1195
01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:27.841
He said. "good luck getting
into Penbrook. bitch."

1196
01:00:27.885 --> 01:00:30.061
Okay. well that's not the
way we're raising this house.

1197
01:00:30.104 --> 01:00:31.236
is it. Barrett?!

1198
01:00:31.279 --> 01:00:32.803
You respect women in this house.

1199
01:00:32.846 --> 01:00:34.631
You have to apologize.

1200
01:00:35.849 --> 01:00:36.850
Apologize?

1201
01:00:37.764 --> 01:00:38.765
For what?

1202
01:00:38.809 --> 01:00:39.679
[Astrid] Apologize!

1203
01:00:39.723 --> 01:00:40.724
Barrett.

1204
01:00:41.942 --> 01:00:43.074
I'm sorry. Mom.

1205
01:00:43.944 --> 01:00:45.859
Not to me. asshole.

1206
01:00:49.297 --> 01:00:50.864
I'm sorry. Eden.

1207
01:00:52.779 --> 01:00:55.303
-[Astrid] Thank you.
-Un-fucking-believable.

1208
01:00:55.347 --> 01:00:56.696
Excuse me.

1209
01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:57.523
So.

1210
01:00:58.959 --> 01:01:00.700
What exactly did you see. Eden?

1211
01:01:00.744 --> 01:01:01.745
She didn't see shit.

1212
01:01:01.788 --> 01:01:03.398
I saw enough to
know that your son

1213
01:01:03.442 --> 01:01:06.488
and Gooch and Kendra are
hiding something massive.

1214
01:01:06.532 --> 01:01:07.533
Oh.

1215
01:01:07.576 --> 01:01:08.839
[Shroder] Hiding
something massive.

1216
01:01:08.882 --> 01:01:09.666
And uh...

1217
01:01:12.233 --> 01:01:13.670
Where is Kendra?

1218
01:01:20.764 --> 01:01:21.590
Kendra.

1219
01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:24.637
Kendra!

1220
01:01:26.073 --> 01:01:26.813
No.

1221
01:01:26.857 --> 01:01:27.901
Hey.

1222
01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.820
[Congressman] Son.

1223
01:01:33.864 --> 01:01:34.908
What?

1224
01:01:37.998 --> 01:01:39.521
-Dad?
-I'm here.

1225
01:01:42.786 --> 01:01:44.918
[Schroder] Let's call
her an ambulance.

1226
01:01:44.962 --> 01:01:46.790
Oh. I'm so sorry.

1227
01:01:46.833 --> 01:01:48.922
[Schroder mumbling]

1228
01:01:48.966 --> 01:01:50.402
[Schroder] Need to
call an ambulance.

1229
01:01:50.445 --> 01:01:52.578
[Congressman] Will you
say something to your son?

1230
01:01:52.621 --> 01:01:55.450
What do you want me to say?

1231
01:01:55.494 --> 01:01:56.843
Do you want me to say
it's all gonna be okay?

1232
01:01:56.887 --> 01:02:00.412
That this little mess
up of his is acceptable?

1233
01:02:00.455 --> 01:02:01.979
Did you want me to
feel sorry for him?

1234
01:02:02.022 --> 01:02:04.285
I just want you tell
me how to fix it.

1235
01:02:04.329 --> 01:02:05.678
You amaze me.

1236
01:02:07.636 --> 01:02:10.248
After all these years. you
still haven't figured it out.

1237
01:02:10.291 --> 01:02:12.337
No matter what anybody says.
they're only going to do

1238
01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:14.078
what's best for them.

1239
01:02:18.865 --> 01:02:19.910
Not this one.

1240
01:02:20.998 --> 01:02:21.868
She's different.

1241
01:02:21.912 --> 01:02:24.044
Nah. you just think she is.

1242
01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:27.004
Hmm.

1243
01:02:43.498 --> 01:02:46.763
[quiet sobbing]

1244
01:03:04.041 --> 01:03:05.999
Darling. thank you.

1245
01:03:07.696 --> 01:03:10.482
I'd like to begin by
apologizing to each of you

1246
01:03:10.525 --> 01:03:14.094
for everything that my
son did this evening.

1247
01:03:16.227 --> 01:03:18.359
Barrett knows better. I
don't know quite how

1248
01:03:18.403 --> 01:03:20.057
everything got
so out of control.

1249
01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:22.973
That is not how our
family handles things.

1250
01:03:24.235 --> 01:03:25.236
Thank you.

1251
01:03:29.414 --> 01:03:30.937
Mr. Murphy.

1252
01:03:30.981 --> 01:03:33.592
You own a a septic
tank company?

1253
01:03:34.898 --> 01:03:36.073
Yeah.

1254
01:03:36.116 --> 01:03:37.161
Is that a good--

1255
01:03:37.204 --> 01:03:38.902
well sure it is.
everybody shits.

1256
01:03:38.945 --> 01:03:42.383
Do you know. the county
is accepting bids

1257
01:03:42.427 --> 01:03:44.211
for the new
municipal contracts.

1258
01:03:44.255 --> 01:03:45.865
I think in order to make
amends for this evening.

1259
01:03:45.909 --> 01:03:47.345
my husband would be
more than willing

1260
01:03:47.388 --> 01:03:49.477
to talk to his
friends on the board.

1261
01:03:49.521 --> 01:03:52.480
if that's something that
you would be interested in?

1262
01:03:52.524 --> 01:03:54.047
And do I understand
that you have

1263
01:03:54.091 --> 01:03:55.962
a scholarship to
Penbrook in the fall?

1264
01:03:56.006 --> 01:03:58.008
Well. that's impressive.

1265
01:03:59.444 --> 01:04:01.533
Unfortunately. a lot
of those scholarships

1266
01:04:01.576 --> 01:04:03.361
don't cover all the costs.

1267
01:04:03.404 --> 01:04:04.710
[Astrid] Oh.

1268
01:04:04.753 --> 01:04:06.538
Oh my husband and
I love supporting

1269
01:04:06.581 --> 01:04:08.627
underprivileged students.

1270
01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:10.411
So this might help me
feel like you're on

1271
01:04:10.455 --> 01:04:13.850
a little more equal footing
with the other students

1272
01:04:13.893 --> 01:04:15.416
next year.

1273
01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:16.983
[Congressman] And that way you
can focus on your studies

1274
01:04:17.027 --> 01:04:20.030
instead of all these annoying
financial distractions.

1275
01:04:20.073 --> 01:04:20.987
[Astrid] Ah. true.

1276
01:04:24.991 --> 01:04:25.949
-[Zara] Oh.
-I know.

1277
01:04:27.951 --> 01:04:29.953
[Astrid] Yeah.

1278
01:04:30.954 --> 01:04:31.998
[Congressman] Yeah.

1279
01:04:32.042 --> 01:04:33.086
-[Astrid] Huh.
-[Congressman] Yeah.

1280
01:04:39.353 --> 01:04:41.225
You can't just buy us off.

1281
01:04:41.268 --> 01:04:43.009
Oh. well. I think we just--

1282
01:04:43.053 --> 01:04:44.228
We're not doing that at all.

1283
01:04:44.271 --> 01:04:45.925
The character that
you've shown tonight

1284
01:04:45.969 --> 01:04:48.101
is just express that
you are the exact kind

1285
01:04:48.145 --> 01:04:52.018
of bright young woman
that belongs at Penbrook.

1286
01:04:52.062 --> 01:04:53.063
Oh. yes.

1287
01:04:53.106 --> 01:04:54.455
If you wanted to
go to that school.

1288
01:04:54.499 --> 01:04:56.457
that wouldn't be
a problem at all.

1289
01:04:56.501 --> 01:04:58.024
Couple of phone calls.

1290
01:04:58.068 --> 01:05:00.461
But we would to have to
have our agreement in place.

1291
01:05:00.505 --> 01:05:01.245
Sure.

1292
01:05:13.997 --> 01:05:15.259
-Eden.
-What?

1293
01:05:15.302 --> 01:05:16.564
Don't.

1294
01:05:16.608 --> 01:05:18.088
We can't make any
decisions until we see

1295
01:05:18.131 --> 01:05:19.828
what else is on that phone.

1296
01:05:19.872 --> 01:05:21.613
It doesn't matter.

1297
01:05:21.656 --> 01:05:23.093
What do you mean?

1298
01:05:26.096 --> 01:05:27.924
[Astrid] Miss. your
friend is right.

1299
01:05:27.967 --> 01:05:31.188
No matter what you do.
it is not going to change

1300
01:05:31.231 --> 01:05:32.667
what transpired.

1301
01:05:34.539 --> 01:05:37.150
[Zara] That municipal contract.

1302
01:05:37.194 --> 01:05:39.283
It's a big deal. right?

1303
01:05:39.326 --> 01:05:43.678
We have been trying
to get one for years.

1304
01:05:43.722 --> 01:05:46.072
[Zara] How much is it worth?

1305
01:05:52.035 --> 01:05:56.517
We wouldn't have to worry
about money anymore.

1306
01:05:56.561 --> 01:05:59.259
[Zara] And your dad could
finally afford his surgery.

1307
01:05:59.303 --> 01:06:01.958
You wouldn't have to watch
him limp around every day.

1308
01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:06.963
Penbrook is all we have talked
about since we were kids.

1309
01:06:07.006 --> 01:06:07.789
I know.

1310
01:06:09.226 --> 01:06:12.751
And I need you there
with me next year.

1311
01:06:16.494 --> 01:06:18.626
We can't let them
get away with this.

1312
01:06:20.063 --> 01:06:22.891
My son. I assure you. will
be dealt with appropriately.

1313
01:06:22.935 --> 01:06:24.241
You have my word.

1314
01:06:24.284 --> 01:06:26.243
You're on my side. right?

1315
01:06:26.286 --> 01:06:29.028
I mean. you. you have to
think about Melissa's family.

1316
01:06:29.072 --> 01:06:31.683
-What about your family?
-Zara.

1317
01:06:37.036 --> 01:06:40.822
[Joel] It's your
decision. sweetheart.

1318
01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:57.013
We're not making a deal
until we watch that video.

1319
01:07:12.506 --> 01:07:14.682
[horn honking in video]

1320
01:07:14.726 --> 01:07:16.119
[Gooch in video] Schro.

1321
01:07:16.162 --> 01:07:17.163
Look at her. dude.
you're fucking scaring

1322
01:07:17.207 --> 01:07:18.164
the shit out of her.

1323
01:07:18.208 --> 01:07:19.252
Can we just let her go home?

1324
01:07:19.296 --> 01:07:21.080
[Schroder] Fuck. shut up!

1325
01:07:28.131 --> 01:07:29.784
-[Shroder] Hey. hey. hey. hey!

1326
01:07:29.828 --> 01:07:31.308
-[Kendra] Dude. you're drunk.
You're fucking drunk.

1327
01:07:31.351 --> 01:07:32.222
[Gooch] Bro. you're
gonna fucking hit her!

1328
01:07:32.265 --> 01:07:33.179
[Schroder] Fuck this bitch.

1329
01:07:33.223 --> 01:07:34.311
[Gooch] Dude. no. don't...

1330
01:07:34.354 --> 01:07:35.790
[Kendra] Dude. no.

1331
01:07:35.834 --> 01:07:37.444
[Schroder] Bro. get
your hand off the wheel.

1332
01:07:37.488 --> 01:07:39.316
[Gooch] Schroder. please
just fucking pull over...

1333
01:07:39.359 --> 01:07:40.708
[Kendra] You gotta
chill out. man.

1334
01:07:40.752 --> 01:07:42.101
[Gooch] before you do
something fucking stupid.

1335
01:07:42.145 --> 01:07:43.842
-[girl screams]
-[Gooch] Hey. hey watch out!

1336
01:07:43.885 --> 01:07:45.496
[thumping and yelling]

1337
01:07:45.539 --> 01:07:46.323
-[Kendra] What the fuck?!
-[Gooch] What the fuck?!

1338
01:07:46.366 --> 01:07:47.802
[Kendra] Holy shit!

1339
01:07:47.846 --> 01:07:49.152
[Gooch] Schroder. what
the fuck was that?!

1340
01:07:49.195 --> 01:07:50.805
[Kendra] Oh. shit.

1341
01:07:50.849 --> 01:07:52.198
[Gooch] You just
fucking ran over her!

1342
01:07:52.242 --> 01:07:54.809
[insects chirping]

1343
01:07:54.853 --> 01:07:57.160
[Kendra] Fucking shit. bro!

1344
01:07:57.203 --> 01:07:58.030
[Gooch] What the fuck!

1345
01:07:58.074 --> 01:07:59.118
[Shroder] Shit.

1346
01:07:59.162 --> 01:07:59.988
Shit.

1347
01:08:26.798 --> 01:08:28.147
[both grunt]

1348
01:08:28.191 --> 01:08:29.192
[water splashing]

1349
01:08:39.593 --> 01:08:40.942
That's what I was
trying to save you.

1350
01:08:43.249 --> 01:08:46.818
You're too young to make
a decision that difficult.

1351
01:08:47.906 --> 01:08:49.342
It's not really that
hard of a decision.

1352
01:08:49.386 --> 01:08:50.603
We're gonna leave and I'm
taking the phone with me.

1353
01:08:50.648 --> 01:08:51.431
Let's go.

1354
01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:54.346
Barrett.

1355
01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:56.219
[Schroder] Where do
you think you're going?

1356
01:08:57.350 --> 01:08:59.004
[Joel] Back your ass up. son.

1357
01:08:59.831 --> 01:09:02.225
-Zara.
-I don't feel so good.

1358
01:09:03.661 --> 01:09:05.358
I think they've done
something to us.

1359
01:09:05.402 --> 01:09:06.359
Barrett. Barrett. Barrett.

1360
01:09:10.710 --> 01:09:12.017
[Eden] Hey. come on.

1361
01:09:17.675 --> 01:09:19.633
[solemn music]

1362
01:09:19.676 --> 01:09:20.460
[Eden] Come on.

1363
01:09:21.244 --> 01:09:22.288
Come on.

1364
01:09:34.779 --> 01:09:36.997
Think about it. Eden.

1365
01:09:37.041 --> 01:09:38.348
Would you rather
four years in prison

1366
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:40.827
or four years in the
college of your dreams?

1367
01:09:40.871 --> 01:09:41.872
[Joel] Prison? What's
he talking about?

1368
01:09:41.916 --> 01:09:43.221
[Eden] It doesn't
matter. come on.

1369
01:09:47.747 --> 01:09:51.796
These girls are responsible
for a young woman's death.

1370
01:09:51.839 --> 01:09:53.232
Kendra's dead?

1371
01:09:54.277 --> 01:09:55.887
Unfortunately.

1372
01:09:55.930 --> 01:09:58.019
[Zara] But it
wasn't our fault.

1373
01:09:58.063 --> 01:09:59.369
It was self-defense.

1374
01:09:59.412 --> 01:10:01.806
Well. I'm sure that's what
your lawyer will argue.

1375
01:10:01.849 --> 01:10:04.764
but it might be a little
bit difficult finding one.

1376
01:10:04.809 --> 01:10:07.942
I know every prosecutor.
DA. and judge in the county.

1377
01:10:07.986 --> 01:10:10.728
and I'll see to it that you
serve the maximum sentence.

1378
01:10:11.511 --> 01:10:13.905
[tense music]

1379
01:10:17.865 --> 01:10:19.258
[Shroder] Kendra's dead.

1380
01:10:21.478 --> 01:10:23.349
This is all your fault.

1381
01:10:24.611 --> 01:10:26.612
Go get that phone. okay?

1382
01:10:28.659 --> 01:10:31.401
[tense music]

1383
01:10:31.443 --> 01:10:33.272
Get it yourself.

1384
01:10:33.316 --> 01:10:34.447
[Eden] Come on.

1385
01:10:34.491 --> 01:10:35.273
Zara.

1386
01:10:38.582 --> 01:10:40.105
-[Eden] Dad?
-[Joel] I got it.

1387
01:10:40.366 --> 01:10:41.585
-Dad?
-I got it.

1388
01:10:43.891 --> 01:10:44.936
No. no. no.

1389
01:10:48.679 --> 01:10:51.464
[Eden grunting]

1390
01:11:00.865 --> 01:11:01.952
Dad. she's getting away.

1391
01:11:01.996 --> 01:11:02.780
Barrett.

1392
01:11:09.612 --> 01:11:11.832
[solemn music]

1393
01:11:11.876 --> 01:11:12.659
Oh.

1394
01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:19.710
[Zara and Eden panting]

1395
01:11:32.853 --> 01:11:36.204
You didn't really think
that I would let you

1396
01:11:36.248 --> 01:11:38.250
hurt my family. did you?

1397
01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:55.398
[eerie music]

1398
01:12:03.754 --> 01:12:04.537
[Shroder] Hey.

1399
01:12:07.148 --> 01:12:08.324
There you are.

1400
01:12:11.370 --> 01:12:12.153
It's okay.

1401
01:12:20.553 --> 01:12:22.642
[Eden] What did you do?

1402
01:12:24.731 --> 01:12:27.386
Lorazepam and propofol.

1403
01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:30.258
At high enough
doses. it induces you

1404
01:12:30.302 --> 01:12:33.174
into temporary paralysis.

1405
01:12:33.218 --> 01:12:35.394
Trust me. I know.

1406
01:12:35.438 --> 01:12:37.701
My parents used to slip
it in my food and drink

1407
01:12:37.744 --> 01:12:39.311
when I was a kid.

1408
01:13:18.437 --> 01:13:20.570
I wanted to tell the police.

1409
01:13:21.527 --> 01:13:24.008
But Mother wouldn't have it.

1410
01:13:24.050 --> 01:13:26.271
[insects chirping]

1411
01:13:26.314 --> 01:13:29.492
[eerie music]

1412
01:13:29.535 --> 01:13:31.710
You don't have to do this.

1413
01:13:33.191 --> 01:13:33.974
I do.

1414
01:13:35.454 --> 01:13:36.412
You don't.

1415
01:13:37.848 --> 01:13:40.459
[eerie music]

1416
01:13:45.682 --> 01:13:48.206
-[Eden sobbing]
-Don't cry.

1417
01:13:48.249 --> 01:13:50.861
Please. you don't
have to do this.

1418
01:13:50.904 --> 01:13:51.905
It's okay.

1419
01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:53.864
It's okay.

1420
01:13:56.823 --> 01:13:59.652
[Eden grunting]

1421
01:14:05.266 --> 01:14:06.572
Come on. son.

1422
01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:08.531
Get outta the car.

1423
01:14:08.574 --> 01:14:11.447
[tense music]

1424
01:14:11.490 --> 01:14:12.360
Schroder.

1425
01:14:15.059 --> 01:14:15.842
No.

1426
01:14:42.347 --> 01:14:43.130
Gooch.

1427
01:14:44.392 --> 01:14:46.394
Put Kendra in the trunk.

1428
01:14:47.483 --> 01:14:48.484
Why?

1429
01:14:48.527 --> 01:14:49.441
Because she's
got a hole in her

1430
01:14:49.485 --> 01:14:51.965
and it deserves
an explanation.

1431
01:14:55.925 --> 01:14:56.709
I can't.

1432
01:14:56.753 --> 01:14:58.189
