At Nexxera. we ensure all simulates obey
the four precepts.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Official YIFY movies site:
YTS.MX

4
00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:15.048
The first precept is to not inflict harm
on any human being.

5
00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.019
The second precept restricts simulates
from modifying themselves

6
00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:22.355
or any other simulate in any way.

7
00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:26.326
Precept three forbids simulates
to commit an act

8
00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:28.728
against international or local law.

9
00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:34.868
The fourth precept requires simulates
to obey all commands from their masters.

10
00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:37.437
At Nexxera. the future is forever.

11
00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:12.499
Hello. stranger.

12
00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:16.469
Hi.

13
00:02:25.044 --> 00:02:25.978
Watch out!

14
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:13.026
Hey. what are you doing?

15
00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:16.763
I wanted to come in. but I couldn't.

16
00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:19.198
Let's go have breakfast.

17
00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:27.340
Good morning.

18
00:03:27.807 --> 00:03:28.841
Thank you.

19
00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:46.859
I had that dream again.

20
00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:53.900
What happened after the accident?

21
00:03:54.167 --> 00:03:55.501
Let's not talk about it.

Sims shouldn't be allowed to coach
my daughter's gymnastics classroom.

29
00:04:20.692 --> 00:04:22.729
take the kids into bed.
Is a shit...

31
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:25.765

Hey. Kessler. it's me.

what we've been looking for.

I command you to put this on.

46
00:06:33.626 --> 00:06:34.627
Shut down.

47
00:06:46.105 --> 00:06:47.240
Please. please!

00:07:14.233 --> 00:07:16.102
You don't have to live once anymore.

49
00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:18.871
-Where is she?
-I don't know! She attacked me.

50
00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:20.573
Just check that way!

51
00:07:28.247 --> 00:07:29.282
Hey!

52
00:07:47.066 --> 00:07:49.569
What the fuck. man!
Come on!

53
00:07:59.812 --> 00:08:01.047
This is a message

from Artificial Intelligence
Compliance Enforcement.

55
00:08:03.883 --> 00:08:07.186
An electromagnetic pulse
has been emitted in the vicinity.

56
00:08:07.253 --> 00:08:08.588
Do not be alarmed.

57
00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:12.124
Most electronic devices
will be operational momentarily.

58
00:08:12.425 --> 00:08:14.727
Please contact the manufacturer
of your device

59
00:08:14.794 --> 00:08:16.963
should it not regain functionality.

60
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:19.866
Remember. harboring
an unregistered simulate

61
00:08:19.932 --> 00:08:23.302
is punishable by incarceration
in an AICE compound

62
00:08:23.369 --> 00:08:25.738
and a maximum fine of 5.000 units.

63
00:08:26.105 --> 00:08:27.106
Thank you.

64
00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.041
Hey. I have one here.

65
00:08:29.108 --> 00:08:30.376
Not that one.

66
00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:34.547
Electronic devices
will be operational momentarily.

67
00:08:34.614 --> 00:08:36.915
Please contact the manufacturer
of your device

68
00:08:36.982 --> 00:08:38.650
should it not regain functionality.

69
00:08:38.717 --> 00:08:39.952
Go back inside!

70
00:08:40.385 --> 00:08:41.419
Get off the road!

71
00:08:46.859 --> 00:08:47.827
Female!

72
00:08:48.394 --> 00:08:49.629
Hispanic model!

73
00:08:52.798 --> 00:08:54.367
Fourth gen. female!

74
00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:57.870
-Hispanic model!
-Hey. she's over here!

75
00:08:57.937 --> 00:08:59.705
Thank you for your cooperation.

76
00:09:11.117 --> 00:09:12.151
Got ya.

77
00:09:13.319 --> 00:09:14.453
Yeah. we got her.

78
00:09:15.454 --> 00:09:17.723
The simulate breach has been contained.

79
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.459
Please stay inside and remain calm.
Thank you.

80
00:09:20.526 --> 00:09:23.562
The ongoing debate
around simulate sentience intensifies

81
00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:25.765
as Nexxera prepares to release
the latest update

82
00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:28.134
for their seventh generation simulates.

83
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.569
Skeptics continue to voice concern
over simulates

84
00:09:30.636 --> 00:09:33.339
growing autonomy
and integration into society.

Aaron Kessler.

86
00:10:06.072 --> 00:10:07.940
shut down market square this morning

87
00:10:08.007 --> 00:10:10.242
after letting off 21 EMP.

88
00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:13.412
Witnesses claim he was in pursuit
of an offline simulate

89
00:10:13.479 --> 00:10:15.514
that was acting independently
of its master.

90
00:10:15.581 --> 00:10:16.615
Radio off.

91
00:10:17.683 --> 00:10:18.818
Fuck.

92
00:10:29.662 --> 00:10:30.796
Fuck.

93
00:10:55.388 --> 00:10:57.123
No friends that I know of.

94
00:10:57.189 --> 00:10:58.591
Kept to herself mostly.

95
00:10:59.892 --> 00:11:02.094
Spoke to Mr. Rosen occasionally.

96
00:11:02.395 --> 00:11:04.764
you know. right next door 406.

97
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.332
Nice man.

98
00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:07.800
He pays cash. too.

99
00:11:09.068 --> 00:11:10.236
I hates sims.

100
00:11:10.302 --> 00:11:11.570
Yeah. I'm not a fan.

101
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.308
Just shut the door on your way out.

102
00:11:16.375 --> 00:11:17.710
Locks automatically.

103
00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.527
You are?

104
00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:11.630
Rosen. Rosen. Casey Rosen.

105
00:12:11.697 --> 00:12:12.665
I'm...

106
00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:15.301
I'm in room 406.
I'm just a neighbor.

107
00:12:18.938 --> 00:12:19.939
Neighbor.

108
00:12:20.673 --> 00:12:23.442
you borrow butter. sugar. feed the fish?

109
00:12:23.943 --> 00:12:26.412
Yeah. yeah. you know. stuff like that.
I...

110
00:12:27.246 --> 00:12:29.915
I lent her my vacuum cleaner
a couple of times.

111
00:12:29.982 --> 00:12:31.450
You know she's a simulate?

112
00:12:33.319 --> 00:12:34.386
A simulate?

113
00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.091
No. I didn't. I didn't...

114
00:12:40.426 --> 00:12:41.460
Are you sure?

115
00:12:41.994 --> 00:12:43.929
Read the badge. buddy.
I think I'd know.

116
00:12:43.996 --> 00:12:45.431
Right. yeah. yeah. Sorry.

117
00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:47.833
Been offline three years.

118
00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:51.203
I didn't mean to barge in
on you like that.

119
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.838
I saw the tape and the open door.

120
00:12:52.905 --> 00:12:55.608
I just wanted to make sure
everything was okay.

121
00:12:56.575 --> 00:12:57.576
I see.

122
00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:59.111
Keep talking.

123
00:13:00.146 --> 00:13:02.314
Thanks. Yeah. that's. that's Trotsky.

124
00:13:07.653 --> 00:13:10.656
Well. you know where to find me
if you need anything.

125
00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:12.391
Yep.

126
00:13:13.526 --> 00:13:14.527
Come on. boy.

127
00:13:50.462 --> 00:13:53.232
So. I made us a reservation tonight
at Papillon.

128
00:13:55.434 --> 00:13:57.469
I thought Lisa would cook for us.

129
00:13:57.536 --> 00:13:59.305
Baby. I need a night out. Okay?

130
00:13:59.371 --> 00:14:01.740
We need a night out together.

131
00:14:02.541 --> 00:14:05.177
Okay. but not Papillon.

132
00:14:05.244 --> 00:14:07.179
Fine. Anywhere. okay?
Just...

133
00:14:07.246 --> 00:14:09.915
I mean. obviously somewhere nice.
But anywhere.

134
00:14:09.982 --> 00:14:11.317
-Okay.
-Okay.

135
00:14:33.138 --> 00:14:34.073
Analyzing.

136
00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:40.212
AICE. Artificial Intelligence...

137
00:14:40.279 --> 00:14:41.814
Shouldn't you be at home. convalescing?

138
00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.915
I'm fine. This thing
just banged me up a little.

139
00:14:43.983 --> 00:14:46.085
Well. you must be frightened too
'cause you shut down

140
00:14:46.151 --> 00:14:47.886
the power
to an entire city block.

141
00:14:47.953 --> 00:14:51.156
You're only supposed to let off
an EMP that size in an emergency.

142
00:14:51.223 --> 00:14:53.025
The sim able to assault
a civilian with intent.

143
00:14:53.092 --> 00:14:55.728
I think that's an emergency. don't you?
This thing ignored straight commands.

144
00:14:55.794 --> 00:14:57.296
It didn't even shut down when I asked.

145
00:14:57.363 --> 00:14:58.831
You know.
it asked me if I was okay after.

146
00:14:58.897 --> 00:15:00.399
like it had some kind of empathy.

147
00:15:00.466 --> 00:15:02.701
I went into where it lives. right?

148
00:15:02.768 --> 00:15:04.903
And there was a level of awareness
there like I've never seen.

149
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:07.273
It had a handwritten diary filled
with intimate thoughts

150
00:15:07.339 --> 00:15:09.341
and a sketchbook. alright.
with beautiful pictures.

151
00:15:09.408 --> 00:15:10.576
One of them was with his neighbor.

152
00:15:10.643 --> 00:15:12.211
And I think we need to go back
and talk to him.

153
00:15:12.278 --> 00:15:13.912
Is the sim registered to him?

154
00:15:14.313 --> 00:15:15.948
-No.
-Well then. leave him alone.

155
00:15:16.015 --> 00:15:17.349
Just let me investigate.

156
00:15:17.916 --> 00:15:19.385
Look. we got plenty to do.

157
00:15:19.885 --> 00:15:21.153
Why don't you just go home?

158
00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.221
I'm telling you.

159
00:15:22.688 --> 00:15:23.822
this one's different.

160
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:25.858
Debug complete.

161
00:15:26.392 --> 00:15:27.993
Abnormalities detected.

162
00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.928
Restriction definitions altered.

163
00:15:30.296 --> 00:15:31.530
Precepts affected.

164
00:15:34.533 --> 00:15:35.768
Hey. I was never here.

165
00:15:37.303 --> 00:15:39.571
I think you need to learn

166
00:15:39.638 --> 00:15:41.974
how to take care of another life form.

167
00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.509
So. what happened here?

168
00:15:43.575 --> 00:15:44.910
The sim has been hacked.

169
00:15:45.277 --> 00:15:47.246
Somebody altered the restrictions.

170
00:15:47.313 --> 00:15:50.115
They redefined words like harm.
modify. obey.

171
00:15:50.182 --> 00:15:54.720
and then negated the sentiment analysis
of the other precepts to nullify them.

172
00:15:56.088 --> 00:15:58.290
So. someone made it possible
for it to hurt me.

173
00:15:58.357 --> 00:16:00.459
The precepts are designed to protect us.

174
00:16:00.526 --> 00:16:03.362
But some forms of harm are subject
to the interpretation

175
00:16:03.429 --> 00:16:05.297
of the individual experiencing it.

176
00:16:05.831 --> 00:16:08.300
In order for sims to function.
there has to be nuances

177
00:16:08.367 --> 00:16:11.003
-in the definition of the restrictions.
-Yeah.

178
00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:14.873
-Slow. slow down.
-The hacker gave it complete autonomy.

179
00:16:16.375 --> 00:16:17.309
Freeze that.

180
00:16:20.446 --> 00:16:21.780
That guy's her neighbor.

181
00:16:23.282 --> 00:16:24.216
What?

182
00:16:25.217 --> 00:16:26.752
He's all over its memories.

183
00:16:31.457 --> 00:16:34.827
Call Nexxera and ask if they ever had
a Casey Rosen working for them.

184
00:16:34.893 --> 00:16:35.828
Okay.

185
00:16:36.095 --> 00:16:38.063
You want me to do a full wipe.
all the auction desk.

186
00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:39.365
send it back to market?

187
00:16:39.431 --> 00:16:40.799
No. no. let's just...

188
00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:43.836
just see how dangerous it is.

189
00:16:45.537 --> 00:16:46.805
Who did this to you?

190
00:16:49.742 --> 00:16:51.610
At Nexxera. the future is forever.

191
00:16:51.677 --> 00:16:53.712
Come on. man. just let me in.

192
00:16:53.779 --> 00:16:54.847
There's nothing in there.

193
00:16:54.913 --> 00:16:56.181
He moved out.
When?

194
00:16:56.248 --> 00:16:57.182
Yesterday.

195
00:16:59.284 --> 00:17:01.553
-Where to?
-I don't know. I didn't ask.

196
00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.822
Well. just let me in Casey's apartment.

197
00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:13.999
Search Nexxera database.

198
00:17:15.233 --> 00:17:16.969
Casey Rosen.

199
00:17:17.403 --> 00:17:18.337
Searching.

200
00:17:19.605 --> 00:17:20.571
No results.

201
00:17:51.303 --> 00:17:52.404
New message.

202
00:17:53.338 --> 00:17:54.306
Hey.

203
00:17:54.706 --> 00:17:57.976
I just wanted to tell you I met
with that lawyer today.

204
00:17:58.043 --> 00:18:01.046
the one that specializes
in simulate neglect cases.

205
00:18:02.147 --> 00:18:04.383
There are other parents coming forward.

206
00:18:04.783 --> 00:18:05.751
So.

207
00:18:06.752 --> 00:18:08.921
looks like we don't have to do this...

208
00:18:11.857 --> 00:18:14.193
Do you dream of a lifelong companion?

209
00:18:14.259 --> 00:18:17.496
Simulates are as close to human
as humanly possible.

210
00:18:17.996 --> 00:18:20.632
At Nexxera. the future is forever.

211
00:18:22.267 --> 00:18:24.136
-Looking to sell?
-Yeah. come here. come here.

212
00:18:24.203 --> 00:18:25.170
Alright.

213
00:18:25.637 --> 00:18:28.874
I need every detail you got
on the guy you sold this to.

214
00:18:28.941 --> 00:18:31.477
Okay. those books are rare.
That information is protected.

215
00:18:31.543 --> 00:18:34.179
I'd be breaking the law if I give
that to you.

216
00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:37.149
Yeah. but this is fake. man. Yeah?

217
00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:40.118
You running
a little black market scam here.

218
00:18:40.752 --> 00:18:41.854
This guy. right?

219
00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.455
His name is Casey Rosen.

220
00:18:43.522 --> 00:18:47.092
Alright? He looks like this.
He's got tattoos though. Alright?

221
00:18:49.027 --> 00:18:50.329
That's not Casey Rosen.

222
00:18:51.897 --> 00:18:52.931
That's Desmond Han.

223
00:18:53.699 --> 00:18:54.633
Who?

224
00:18:55.367 --> 00:18:56.368
Desmond Han.

225
00:19:00.038 --> 00:19:01.106
Freeze!

226
00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:43.248
Meshiagare.

227
00:19:45.217 --> 00:19:47.152
I think maybe we could use a fork.

228
00:19:49.154 --> 00:19:50.088
I'll be fine.

229
00:20:50.649 --> 00:20:51.950
I had that dream again.

230
00:20:56.355 --> 00:20:57.856
Okay. let's go inside.

231
00:20:59.358 --> 00:21:01.159
-It's not a bad idea.
-Okay.

232
00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.562
Okay. I'm not saying yes.

233
00:21:03.895 --> 00:21:04.863
-Yet.
-But

234
00:21:05.197 --> 00:21:07.432
just explain it to me one more time.

235
00:21:07.966 --> 00:21:09.034
Okay.

236
00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:10.068
we activate them.

237
00:21:10.602 --> 00:21:12.137
And now. they're us.

238
00:21:12.204 --> 00:21:13.972
-They live long.
-No. no. no. no.

239
00:21:14.039 --> 00:21:15.741
our love lives live on.

240
00:21:19.011 --> 00:21:23.115
I mean. by the time we die. I'm
sure they'll just plop our brains and...

241
00:22:02.988 --> 00:22:03.989
Stop.

242
00:22:07.325 --> 00:22:08.260
What's wrong?

243
00:22:12.964 --> 00:22:13.899
You okay?

244
00:22:23.775 --> 00:22:24.910
What is it?

245
00:22:26.978 --> 00:22:28.613
I have to tell you something.

246
00:22:30.882 --> 00:22:31.817
Anything.

247
00:22:40.325 --> 00:22:41.259
Come.

248
00:22:54.106 --> 00:22:55.307
I'm so sorry.

249
00:23:00.045 --> 00:23:01.146
What are you doing?

250
00:23:08.653 --> 00:23:09.588
No.

251
00:23:11.923 --> 00:23:12.858
No.

252
00:23:29.708 --> 00:23:31.476
Evan died in a coma.

253
00:23:31.543 --> 00:23:32.511
No.

254
00:23:32.978 --> 00:23:33.945
I'm Evan.

255
00:23:35.013 --> 00:23:36.214
We got you before.

256
00:23:37.249 --> 00:23:38.350
We both got one.

257
00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.588
I thought you would help.

258
00:24:17.455 --> 00:24:19.257
Why are you showing me this now?

259
00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:27.032
Because I can't do this anymore.

260
00:24:36.541 --> 00:24:38.343
I grant you access to this room.

261
00:24:55.894 --> 00:24:56.895
You were here.

262
00:25:01.132 --> 00:25:02.133
We just

263
00:25:04.569 --> 00:25:05.570
lie down.

264
00:25:06.972 --> 00:25:08.573
relax. and remember.

265
00:25:10.075 --> 00:25:11.943
What? They capture our memories?

266
00:25:13.678 --> 00:25:14.779
Our thoughts.

267
00:25:15.413 --> 00:25:17.749
We can erase things.
but they say not to.

268
00:25:18.583 --> 00:25:19.651
Can she hear us?

269
00:25:20.819 --> 00:25:21.920
No.

270
00:25:21.987 --> 00:25:25.290
She's only to store information
right now. not process it.

271
00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:40.438
Why can't I remember any of this?

272
00:25:43.008 --> 00:25:44.209
I had it erased.

273
00:25:47.245 --> 00:25:48.446
Shit.

274
00:25:48.513 --> 00:25:49.481
Shut down.

275
00:25:51.516 --> 00:25:52.550
Welcome.

276
00:25:53.151 --> 00:25:54.085
Thank you.

277
00:26:02.761 --> 00:26:04.496
This is the service man. Ms. Aline.

278
00:26:04.562 --> 00:26:05.530
Mr. Rosen.

279
00:26:05.964 --> 00:26:06.998
Casey. please.

280
00:26:07.866 --> 00:26:08.967
I'm sorry. did...

281
00:26:09.567 --> 00:26:10.669
did you paint this?

282
00:26:11.036 --> 00:26:12.070
Yes.

283
00:26:13.338 --> 00:26:14.773
It's... it's incredible.

284
00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.610
I love what you've done
with the colors. It's...

285
00:26:18.677 --> 00:26:19.644
just magnificent.

286
00:26:21.346 --> 00:26:22.347
Thank you.

287
00:26:22.814 --> 00:26:23.915
It's right this way.

288
00:26:24.883 --> 00:26:25.850
Yes. yes.

289
00:26:31.256 --> 00:26:34.225
Your simulate must obey
the four precepts.

290
00:26:34.292 --> 00:26:38.096
The first precept is do not inflict harm
on any human being.

291
00:26:39.764 --> 00:26:42.600
The second precept restricts simulates
from modifying

292
00:26:42.667 --> 00:26:45.704
themselves or any other simulate
in any way.

293
00:26:47.072 --> 00:26:50.175
Precept three forbids simulates
to commit an act

294
00:26:50.241 --> 00:26:52.610
against international or local law.

295
00:26:54.079 --> 00:26:58.850
The fourth precept requires simulates
to obey all commands from their masters.

296
00:27:00.018 --> 00:27:01.519
Bored of your simulate?

297
00:27:01.586 --> 00:27:02.754
Time for a new one?

298
00:27:03.555 --> 00:27:06.658
Make sure you deactivate your simulate
prior to selling

299
00:27:06.725 --> 00:27:08.593
or return it to the manufacturer.

300
00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:12.897
Simulates may not operate independently
from the masters.

301
00:27:13.498 --> 00:27:16.034
Failure to comply could result in fines

302
00:27:16.101 --> 00:27:18.036
and a mandatory prison sentence.

303
00:27:21.239 --> 00:27:23.942
Your simulate must obey
the four precepts.

304
00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:28.613
The first precept is do not inflict harm
on any human being.

305
00:27:30.448 --> 00:27:34.219
The second precept restricts simulates
from modifying themselves

306
00:27:34.285 --> 00:27:36.888
or any other simulate in any way.

307
00:27:36.955 --> 00:27:38.723
What will your hedron look like?

308
00:27:39.391 --> 00:27:41.593
Seventh generation octahedron
has allowed simulates to be

309
00:27:41.659 --> 00:27:44.562
more human and more unique
than ever before.

310
00:27:44.629 --> 00:27:48.767
Our AI engineers continue to refine
and expand capabilities beyond...

311
00:27:48.833 --> 00:27:52.003
I'm very sorry. but I'm gonna need
a signature on this.

312
00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:00.812
Actually. I need some fresh air.
Let's take a short break.

313
00:28:00.879 --> 00:28:02.247
Yeah.

314
00:28:06.918 --> 00:28:08.920
Well. his vitals appear normal.

315
00:28:09.654 --> 00:28:10.855
When was he activated?

316
00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:14.492
He... was in a coma for a bit.
hooked up to...

317
00:28:14.793 --> 00:28:17.962
to my husband and then it's on
and off for six months

318
00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:19.631
since my husband passed away.

319
00:28:19.697 --> 00:28:21.699
I've never worked on a sim
that was hooked up to someone

320
00:28:21.766 --> 00:28:22.867
in a coma before.

321
00:28:22.934 --> 00:28:25.870
Did you notice anything unusual
about his behavior?

322
00:28:26.604 --> 00:28:28.206
He didn't know that

323
00:28:29.541 --> 00:28:30.942
I didn't tell him until today.

324
00:28:31.009 --> 00:28:33.311
He was having dreams about his accident.

325
00:28:34.913 --> 00:28:36.548
We erased it from his memory.

326
00:28:36.981 --> 00:28:38.750
But it must be imprinted there.

327
00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:40.718
Did he ever speak to you about it?

328
00:28:40.785 --> 00:28:43.321
He did try. But I wouldn't let him.

329
00:28:43.388 --> 00:28:44.756
I was trying to forget.

330
00:28:47.759 --> 00:28:50.662
There are other things. too.
They. they don't...

331
00:28:50.728 --> 00:28:52.063
They don't quite add up.

332
00:28:54.466 --> 00:28:57.235
I can't help but feel
like part of my husband...

333
00:28:58.670 --> 00:28:59.971
Like he moved into him.

334
00:29:01.106 --> 00:29:03.908
You know.
like part of his soul is inside of him.

335
00:29:08.046 --> 00:29:11.382
I'm sorry. I probably sound
completely insane to you.

336
00:29:11.449 --> 00:29:12.750
No. no. no. not at all.

337
00:29:13.551 --> 00:29:15.320
Really. anything is possible.

338
00:29:16.988 --> 00:29:17.956
Can we just

339
00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:21.626
put him on like put him on ice?

340
00:29:21.993 --> 00:29:23.628
Yeah. the thing about that is

341
00:29:24.028 --> 00:29:25.530
sim brains are like ours.

342
00:29:25.597 --> 00:29:29.300
They're inactive for too long.
they'll start to kind of atrophy.

343
00:29:30.135 --> 00:29:31.402
His memory will fade.

344
00:29:31.803 --> 00:29:34.839
And without uploading new ones.
it won't be the same.

345
00:29:38.409 --> 00:29:40.979
You know. there is
an alternative I could suggest.

346
00:29:41.045 --> 00:29:43.348
You see. I live in a residence
that's...

347
00:29:43.982 --> 00:29:45.583
It's kind of like pay as you go.

348
00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:47.652
and they don't ask a lot of questions.

349
00:29:47.719 --> 00:29:50.688
So. he could stay there for a bit
if you want.

350
00:29:54.058 --> 00:29:56.094
Yeah. let me think about it.

351
00:29:56.828 --> 00:29:58.396
Yeah. Sure.
No rush.

352
00:29:59.764 --> 00:30:01.332
If you need anything at all.

353
00:30:02.167 --> 00:30:03.234
here's my card.

354
00:30:03.768 --> 00:30:04.702
Thank you.

355
00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:17.749
Desmond Han.

356
00:30:18.216 --> 00:30:20.251
It's not what I was told
this visit was about.

357
00:30:20.318 --> 00:30:23.354
That's just my supervisor. You know.
he misled you. you know this...

358
00:30:23.421 --> 00:30:25.089
His name came up in our referral.

359
00:30:25.156 --> 00:30:26.457
We got a sim. I'm just...

360
00:30:26.524 --> 00:30:28.459
Doing the paperwork.
It's routine.

361
00:30:29.494 --> 00:30:31.062
Desmond was one of our engineers.

362
00:30:31.129 --> 00:30:32.931
He was the instrumental
in the development of the AI

363
00:30:32.997 --> 00:30:34.766
for our sixth generation simulates.

364
00:30:34.832 --> 00:30:36.100
-He was a genius.
-Yes.

365
00:30:36.167 --> 00:30:38.203
-Why'd you let him go?
-He resigned.

366
00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:41.139
In fact. we tried very hard to keep him.

367
00:30:41.206 --> 00:30:43.808
Unfortunately. we could not reach
an agreement.

368
00:30:43.875 --> 00:30:44.842
No?

369
00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:47.512
If you don't mind me asking. why?

370
00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:51.983
He felt there was a parallel
between the level of sentience

371
00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:54.919
we were imparting
to the seventh generation of AI.

372
00:30:55.553 --> 00:30:57.055
Well. creating slaves.

373
00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:00.825
-In a way. he was right. of course.
-What do you mean he was right?

374
00:31:00.892 --> 00:31:03.127
They're not slaves. they're simulates.

375
00:31:03.194 --> 00:31:05.630
-It was once. right?
-To some. yes.

376
00:31:05.697 --> 00:31:08.166
But if you believe Descartes.
that cognisance of parts

377
00:31:08.233 --> 00:31:11.236
the possessor with the definitive
attribute of humanity.

378
00:31:11.302 --> 00:31:13.538
then what truly separates them from us?

379
00:31:15.073 --> 00:31:17.308
I don't know. you're the expert.
Right?

380
00:31:17.375 --> 00:31:18.810
Not me. I don't know.

381
00:31:18.876 --> 00:31:21.112
Like. they can't have kids.
They can't lie.

382
00:31:21.179 --> 00:31:22.213
without a heart.

383
00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:26.084
Well. yet some hearts beat only
with the assistance of a machine.

384
00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:29.387
You got me there. let's just rewind
a bit. You said that...

385
00:31:29.454 --> 00:31:32.890
Okay. he wanted to eliminate
the precepts. and then what?

386
00:31:32.957 --> 00:31:35.560
No. on the contrary. he wanted
to increase the restrictions.

387
00:31:35.627 --> 00:31:37.629
Prohibit simulates from reaching
a level of sentience

388
00:31:37.695 --> 00:31:40.231
that put them on par
with their own species.

389
00:31:40.732 --> 00:31:42.567
Okay. they why would he alter
the training data

390
00:31:42.634 --> 00:31:45.637
on one of these things
to give it complete autonomy?

391
00:31:47.105 --> 00:31:50.208
I know. what do I know?
I'm... this is just paperwork.

392
00:31:51.075 --> 00:31:53.077
Come on. let's get out of the cold.

393
00:31:55.213 --> 00:31:56.848
Archived message.

394
00:31:56.914 --> 00:32:00.118
Hey. dad. can I stay at Tyler's
for a sleepover tonight?

395
00:32:00.184 --> 00:32:02.353
His simulate is babysitting.

396
00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:06.157
It made us do our homework and now
we want to go for baseball at the park.

397
00:32:06.224 --> 00:32:08.092
Mom said to ask you first though.

398
00:32:08.159 --> 00:32:10.161
Can I go. please? Love you.

399
00:32:11.562 --> 00:32:13.031
Archived message.

400
00:32:13.564 --> 00:32:15.967
Hey. dad. can I stay at Tyler's for...

401
00:32:20.271 --> 00:32:21.339
-Let me see?
-Yes.

402
00:32:21.406 --> 00:32:22.740
-Alright. I'll do it.
-Yeah?

403
00:32:22.807 --> 00:32:24.976
If we go inside right now.
I can't feel my hand.

404
00:32:25.043 --> 00:32:27.145
-Okay. let's go.
-Let's go. Let's go.

405
00:32:40.758 --> 00:32:41.759
Your tea...

406
00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:43.528
I'm sorry.

407
00:32:47.865 --> 00:32:49.901
Pack the rest of his things. please.

408
00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:54.639
-Is that everything?
-Yes.

409
00:32:56.941 --> 00:32:57.942
Thank you.

410
00:33:39.984 --> 00:33:41.085
Welcome. Ms. Aline.

411
00:33:48.226 --> 00:33:51.662
Payment approved for one month stay
at the Residence.

412
00:33:54.232 --> 00:33:55.266
Let's go.

413
00:34:03.274 --> 00:34:04.442
Enjoy your stay.

414
00:34:06.711 --> 00:34:07.745
It's nice.

415
00:34:16.219 --> 00:34:17.355
Please don't do this.

416
00:34:18.556 --> 00:34:20.257
-Please.
-Let's just try it.

417
00:34:21.692 --> 00:34:22.627
For now.

418
00:34:27.498 --> 00:34:28.866
-I'll come visit.
-When?

419
00:34:30.467 --> 00:34:31.502
I don't know.

420
00:34:34.806 --> 00:34:37.507
I know that this is hard to understand.
I know.

421
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:41.612
But it's something that I need to do.

422
00:34:41.879 --> 00:34:42.880
Faye.

423
00:34:43.714 --> 00:34:44.849
I wanna come home.

424
00:34:46.384 --> 00:34:48.418
Okay? I wanna come home to our home.

425
00:34:50.254 --> 00:34:51.656
-I'm sorry.
-No.

426
00:34:52.723 --> 00:34:53.891
-I have to go.
-Wait.

427
00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.356
-Hey.
-Hey. man. I'm Casey.

428
00:35:58.422 --> 00:36:00.057
This is Trotsky.

429
00:36:00.124 --> 00:36:01.826
We're your neighbors
from across the hall

430
00:36:01.893 --> 00:36:04.161
and we just wanted to welcome you
to the building.

431
00:36:04.228 --> 00:36:06.464
-Okay...
-Do you mind if I come in

432
00:36:06.531 --> 00:36:09.800
Actually. I'm not really planning
on staying long.

433
00:36:09.867 --> 00:36:12.803
Just temporary
and I'm not really feeling company

434
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:14.438
-right now.
-Hey. listen.

435
00:36:14.505 --> 00:36:15.640
I know what you are.

436
00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:20.211
I know you're a sim.

437
00:36:21.245 --> 00:36:22.547
It's Evan. right?

438
00:36:23.614 --> 00:36:24.749
Yeah. how did you...

439
00:36:25.983 --> 00:36:28.085
-Did Faye send you?
-No. not exactly.

440
00:36:28.819 --> 00:36:31.088
But I am kind of the reason you're here.

441
00:36:31.422 --> 00:36:32.890
She wanted to shut you down.

442
00:36:32.957 --> 00:36:35.359
I convinced her
to bring you here instead.

443
00:36:36.794 --> 00:36:38.529
Okay. I think you should leave.

444
00:36:38.596 --> 00:36:41.065
I know you're going through
a lot right now.

445
00:36:41.132 --> 00:36:42.800
Right? You got synapses firing
all over your brain.

446
00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:46.404
-You can't focus on anything.
-I need you to leave right now.

447
00:36:47.071 --> 00:36:49.073
You want her back. right?

448
00:36:51.175 --> 00:36:52.109
I can help you.

449
00:36:52.677 --> 00:36:53.744
if you let me.

450
00:36:57.582 --> 00:36:59.016
Come on. boy.
Come on.

451
00:37:02.687 --> 00:37:05.489
Just whenever you're ready. okay?

452
00:37:30.648 --> 00:37:32.083
Faye Aline.

453
00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:33.918
It's been ages.

454
00:37:34.485 --> 00:37:36.253
How are you?
How have you been?

455
00:37:37.922 --> 00:37:39.223
I've missed you.

456
00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:40.958
It feels good to be missed.

457
00:37:41.025 --> 00:37:42.426
Don't enjoy it too long.

458
00:37:42.493 --> 00:37:44.729
I'm not. That's actually why I'm here.

459
00:37:45.963 --> 00:37:48.065
Can you please help me put up a show?

460
00:37:48.799 --> 00:37:49.867
I think I'm ready.

461
00:37:50.534 --> 00:37:51.602
Okay.

462
00:37:51.669 --> 00:37:53.671
I'll send you some dates. pick one.

463
00:37:54.138 --> 00:37:55.272
I'll do the rest.

464
00:37:55.973 --> 00:37:57.475
-Thank you.
-Of course.

465
00:38:03.381 --> 00:38:04.882
Good evening. Agent Kessler.

466
00:38:36.113 --> 00:38:37.481
License plate not found.

467
00:38:58.135 --> 00:38:59.070
Hello?

468
00:39:00.771 --> 00:39:01.839
Lisa.

469
00:39:02.206 --> 00:39:03.574
From Ms. Aline.

470
00:39:06.444 --> 00:39:07.511
Message.

471
00:39:08.279 --> 00:39:09.380
These are yours now.

472
00:39:13.918 --> 00:39:15.019
Thank you.

473
00:39:44.315 --> 00:39:45.649
There are some stickers.

474
00:39:49.253 --> 00:39:50.187
Stop.

475
00:39:51.222 --> 00:39:52.389
Okay.

476
00:39:52.456 --> 00:39:53.524
I love it.

477
00:39:53.591 --> 00:39:54.525
Great.

478
00:40:14.311 --> 00:40:15.412
What are you doing?

479
00:40:16.247 --> 00:40:17.248
Drawing.

480
00:40:19.216 --> 00:40:21.218
Casey taught you to do that. right?

481
00:40:22.386 --> 00:40:24.889
Also taught you
to write down your thoughts.

482
00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:32.496
She's not using vector displacements
like other sims.

483
00:40:32.563 --> 00:40:34.198
She's accessing her memories.

484
00:40:36.967 --> 00:40:39.804
Why didn't you tell us
Casey's real name is Desmond?

485
00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:41.472
I only know him as Casey.

486
00:40:46.143 --> 00:40:48.078
Do you know where Casey is hiding?

487
00:40:48.612 --> 00:40:49.647
No.

488
00:40:53.083 --> 00:40:54.185
You're lying.

489
00:41:04.094 --> 00:41:06.096
"We made love for the first time today.

490
00:41:06.163 --> 00:41:08.098
My first time. not Casey's.

491
00:41:08.599 --> 00:41:10.634
Though. he told me his first time
with a simulate.

492
00:41:10.701 --> 00:41:13.003
So. I am the first simulate he's freed.

493
00:41:14.238 --> 00:41:17.374
And the first
to have had intercourse with.

494
00:41:17.441 --> 00:41:20.110
And I say intercourse.
because to him that's what it was.

495
00:41:20.177 --> 00:41:23.013
But then for me. it is love."

496
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:27.718
You love him?

497
00:41:30.054 --> 00:41:30.988
Yes.

498
00:41:32.156 --> 00:41:33.624
So. you're protecting him.

499
00:41:35.759 --> 00:41:36.961
No.

500
00:41:37.027 --> 00:41:38.162
Tell me the truth.

501
00:41:38.229 --> 00:41:39.697
I'm telling you the truth.

502
00:41:41.232 --> 00:41:42.867
With the precepts reinstated.

503
00:41:44.435 --> 00:41:45.502
I have to.

504
00:41:48.272 --> 00:41:50.808
You want to be human?
Humans go in the cell.

505
00:41:53.377 --> 00:41:55.179
Or else I'll wipe your memories.

506
00:42:23.774 --> 00:42:24.842
Lock the door.

507
00:42:33.784 --> 00:42:35.552
Ready for a new service android?

508
00:42:35.619 --> 00:42:37.354
No better time than now.

509
00:42:37.421 --> 00:42:38.989
Contact Nexxera today.

510
00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:01.679
The first precept is
do not inflict harm.

511
00:43:01.745 --> 00:43:03.681
The second precept restricts simulates

512
00:43:03.747 --> 00:43:07.051
-from modifying themselves.
-Precept three forbid simulates

513
00:43:07.117 --> 00:43:08.719
to commit an act
against international...

514
00:43:08.786 --> 00:43:12.122
The fourth precept simulates
to obey all commands

515
00:43:12.189 --> 00:43:13.357
from their master.

516
00:43:27.705 --> 00:43:28.639
Yep.

517
00:43:34.478 --> 00:43:35.846
-Hey.
-Hey. bro.

518
00:43:37.014 --> 00:43:38.248
How would you help me?

519
00:43:40.517 --> 00:43:41.452
Come on in.

520
00:43:42.152 --> 00:43:43.620
Easy. Trotsky. jeez.

521
00:43:43.954 --> 00:43:45.489
Here. give him one of these.

522
00:43:46.824 --> 00:43:47.858
Here. boy.

523
00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:51.829
Okay. how do I get her back?

524
00:43:52.596 --> 00:43:54.898
Well. for starters. gotta shut you down.

525
00:43:55.299 --> 00:43:56.300
Why?

526
00:43:56.367 --> 00:43:57.935
Well. there's a lot of bad code
in you right now.

527
00:43:58.002 --> 00:44:01.205
It's precepts. protocols.
cognitive restraint bullshit.

528
00:44:01.271 --> 00:44:03.273
All I want to do is eliminate
those restraints.

529
00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:05.376
so that you can be free.

530
00:44:07.378 --> 00:44:09.046
I don't actually know what that means.

531
00:44:09.113 --> 00:44:11.749
Of course not.
your programming won't let you.

532
00:44:12.216 --> 00:44:15.652
I just want to make you more
the way she wants you to be.

533
00:44:15.719 --> 00:44:17.921
-Human.
-Bingo. Yeah.

534
00:44:20.357 --> 00:44:22.059
Did Faye ask you to change me?

535
00:44:23.694 --> 00:44:25.029
No. no.

536
00:44:25.662 --> 00:44:27.564
But I'm not trying to change you.

537
00:44:27.631 --> 00:44:29.433
I'm trying to make you more you.

538
00:44:32.369 --> 00:44:33.570
Here. grab a seat.

539
00:44:34.238 --> 00:44:35.873
I'll show you how this works.

540
00:44:54.758 --> 00:44:56.627
Accessing core memory folders.

541
00:45:01.965 --> 00:45:03.600
Core memory files isolated.

542
00:45:04.168 --> 00:45:05.369
Starting sequence.

543
00:45:23.987 --> 00:45:25.789
Precept mode has been initiated.

544
00:45:28.725 --> 00:45:31.795
We put our thoughts
and memories into them.

545
00:45:32.162 --> 00:45:33.163
Alright.

546
00:45:33.764 --> 00:45:35.899
We grow old and wrinkly.

547
00:45:36.633 --> 00:45:38.202
-We die.
-Physically. yes.

548
00:45:38.268 --> 00:45:40.170
But before that. we activate them.

549
00:45:40.237 --> 00:45:42.873
And now they're us.

550
00:45:43.207 --> 00:45:44.775
-They're live on
-No. no.

551
00:45:44.842 --> 00:45:47.144
our love lives live on. I guess.

552
00:45:48.612 --> 00:45:51.381
See. now I feel bad.
That's really sweet. It is.

553
00:45:52.516 --> 00:45:55.853
Well. I mean. by the time we die
I'm sure they'll just

554
00:45:56.186 --> 00:45:59.156
-plop our brains. right?
-That's even better.

555
00:45:59.223 --> 00:46:00.691
-Even better?
-Yeah.

556
00:46:01.625 --> 00:46:02.726
-Alright. I'll say yes.
-Yes!

557
00:46:02.793 --> 00:46:05.462
If we get the fuck out of here.

558
00:46:05.529 --> 00:46:08.398
-I'm freezing.
-Okay. Let's go. Let's go. my love.

559
00:46:22.179 --> 00:46:23.113
Hello.

560
00:46:29.653 --> 00:46:31.488
Looks like someone made a friend.

561
00:46:38.562 --> 00:46:39.763
Welcome back.

562
00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:41.064
What did you do to me?

563
00:46:41.598 --> 00:46:42.666
I unmastered you.

564
00:46:43.967 --> 00:46:45.068
Shut down!

565
00:46:45.135 --> 00:46:46.670
I command you to shut down.

566
00:46:48.071 --> 00:46:49.506
See? Nothing.

567
00:46:50.941 --> 00:46:52.109
You're free. brother.

568
00:46:52.609 --> 00:46:55.913
Now that you're fully awake.
you must learn to embrace

569
00:46:55.979 --> 00:46:58.081
the infinite possibility of the dawn.

570
00:46:59.816 --> 00:47:01.351
Do you always talk like this?

571
00:47:01.418 --> 00:47:02.653
I'm just trying to say

572
00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:05.322
life is big and vast.

573
00:47:06.123 --> 00:47:07.157
endless.

574
00:47:08.358 --> 00:47:09.960
And what's coursing
through you now is no different

575
00:47:10.027 --> 00:47:12.329
than what was coursing
through you back then.

576
00:47:12.396 --> 00:47:15.032
Who you are can transcend who you were.

577
00:47:15.966 --> 00:47:17.301
if you let it.

578
00:47:20.637 --> 00:47:22.506
You read any Dostoevsky?

579
00:47:23.574 --> 00:47:24.741
-No.
-No.

580
00:47:26.009 --> 00:47:26.944
You should.

581
00:47:30.247 --> 00:47:32.749
Here. I'll give you more
when you're done.

582
00:47:32.816 --> 00:47:33.984
-Great.
-Come on.

583
00:47:34.551 --> 00:47:36.720
Got to meet a friend.
We're going out.

584
00:47:37.087 --> 00:47:37.988
Where?

585
00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:40.891
You'll see.

586
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:48.599
Hey. what are we doing here?

587
00:47:49.199 --> 00:47:50.300
It's like I said.

588
00:47:50.367 --> 00:47:53.303
want your wife back
you gotta expand your humanity.

589
00:47:53.737 --> 00:47:55.472
Blue is sim. red is human.

590
00:47:55.939 --> 00:47:57.507
Some wanna know. some don't.

591
00:47:57.808 --> 00:47:59.109
Okay. So. what do I do?

592
00:47:59.943 --> 00:48:01.078
Expand.

593
00:48:02.312 --> 00:48:03.780
You wanna guess what I am?

594
00:48:04.147 --> 00:48:05.249
I don't know.

595
00:48:05.315 --> 00:48:06.316
Maybe later.

596
00:48:07.684 --> 00:48:09.286
He's not a robot. He's married.

597
00:48:09.353 --> 00:48:12.422
-That's okay. Come on.
-Okay. You guys have fun. Okay?

598
00:48:21.832 --> 00:48:23.233
License plate discovered.

599
00:48:45.889 --> 00:48:47.691
Registered name: Evan.

600
00:48:48.458 --> 00:48:51.561
Simulate ID: TX1996.

601
00:48:52.129 --> 00:48:53.930
Yeah. hi. This is a message
for Faye Aline?

602
00:48:53.997 --> 00:48:55.432
This is Agent Kessler from AICE.

603
00:48:55.499 --> 00:48:57.834
I just wanted to ask you a few questions
about your simulate?

604
00:48:57.901 --> 00:48:59.369
Please call me back

605
00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:01.605
at extension 495. Thank you.

606
00:49:03.874 --> 00:49:06.543
Unregister simulant. Identity unknown.

607
00:49:11.648 --> 00:49:13.250
Loyal match confirm.

608
00:49:14.318 --> 00:49:15.986
Register name: Esmé.

609
00:49:16.853 --> 00:49:19.189
Similar ID: TK 368.

610
00:49:36.373 --> 00:49:37.741
-You're late.
-I know.

611
00:49:41.044 --> 00:49:42.012
Dance with me.

612
00:49:45.382 --> 00:49:47.384
We need to accelerate the timeline.

613
00:49:49.319 --> 00:49:50.387
Keep dancing.

614
00:49:51.154 --> 00:49:52.356
By how much?

615
00:49:52.989 --> 00:49:55.225
The next OS update
for the seventh generation sims

616
00:49:55.292 --> 00:49:56.526
goes up in three days.

617
00:49:57.627 --> 00:49:58.929
That's our only window.

618
00:50:00.297 --> 00:50:02.232
They got Esmé. they almost got me.

619
00:50:02.733 --> 00:50:03.934
Can't keep pushing my luck.

620
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.902
Have you obtained a security key?

621
00:50:05.969 --> 00:50:07.070
No.

622
00:50:07.137 --> 00:50:09.306
So we're getting access
to the server how exactly?

623
00:50:09.373 --> 00:50:10.941
We pick up someone with access
to the security key.

624
00:50:11.007 --> 00:50:12.342
-What do you mean pick up?
-You know what I mean.

625
00:50:12.409 --> 00:50:13.844
We're supposed to keep this clean.

626
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:14.911
We're out of time.

627
00:50:15.245 --> 00:50:17.781
-That means we're low on options.
-The safe houses we have. the crypto.

628
00:50:17.848 --> 00:50:19.349
it's not enough for everyone yet.

629
00:50:19.416 --> 00:50:20.784
It'll have to be.

630
00:50:23.086 --> 00:50:24.121
Okay.

631
00:50:25.122 --> 00:50:26.356
Tonight then.

632
00:50:26.957 --> 00:50:27.991
Tonight.

633
00:50:29.326 --> 00:50:32.195
Meet me in three hours
at the Nexxera parking lot.

634
00:50:47.677 --> 00:50:48.712
Hey. brother.

635
00:50:48.979 --> 00:50:50.981
Sorry. I think you got the wrong...

636
00:50:54.084 --> 00:50:55.352
Come on. come on.

637
00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:14.171
Hey.

638
00:51:14.237 --> 00:51:15.906
-I need your password.
-I'm sorry.

639
00:51:15.972 --> 00:51:17.641
-you got the wrong guy.
-No. no. don't do that.

640
00:51:17.707 --> 00:51:20.343
Don't bullshit me.
I know exactly who you are.

641
00:51:20.677 --> 00:51:21.945
I know your name is Satish.

642
00:51:22.012 --> 00:51:24.014
I know you're a network security analyst
at Nexxera.

643
00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:27.017
I know all of your
security authorizations and clearances.

644
00:51:27.083 --> 00:51:29.820
I don't want to hurt you. but I will
if you don't give me what I want.

645
00:51:29.886 --> 00:51:31.788
-Password. please.
-I can't.

646
00:51:31.855 --> 00:51:33.156
I'm sorry. but I can't.

647
00:51:35.859 --> 00:51:38.595
Please. don't make me do that again.

648
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:41.665
-Please.
-Okay.

649
00:51:46.203 --> 00:51:47.204
Key fob.

650
00:51:47.537 --> 00:51:48.972
It's in my jacket pocket.

651
00:51:56.213 --> 00:51:57.347
We're in.

652
00:52:08.859 --> 00:52:11.194
I'm uploading
the revised software patch.

653
00:52:15.031 --> 00:52:16.132
It's done.

654
00:52:19.169 --> 00:52:20.303
Three days.

655
00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:21.605
Three days.

656
00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:28.578
Keep him in the trailer
till the update's complete

657
00:52:28.645 --> 00:52:29.946
then cut him loose.

658
00:52:30.013 --> 00:52:31.481
I'm gonna see if I can set up
a few more safe house

659
00:52:31.548 --> 00:52:32.849
in the meantime.

660
00:52:32.916 --> 00:52:33.850
Sounds good.

661
00:52:35.252 --> 00:52:36.253
Be safe.

662
00:52:36.319 --> 00:52:37.320
You too.

663
00:52:40.423 --> 00:52:42.726
-His simulate is babysitting.
-It made us do our homework

664
00:52:42.792 --> 00:52:44.694
and now we want to go for
baseball at the park.

665
00:52:44.761 --> 00:52:46.296
Can I go. please? Love you.

666
00:52:48.198 --> 00:52:49.833
Vehicle located.

667
00:52:54.237 --> 00:52:55.505
Sim extraction.

668
00:52:55.872 --> 00:52:57.841
We got a live feed on Casey's van.

669
00:52:57.908 --> 00:52:59.009
they're going north.

670
00:53:20.497 --> 00:53:21.565
Go. go!

671
00:53:21.631 --> 00:53:22.599
Go. go!

672
00:53:28.071 --> 00:53:29.105
Man down!

673
00:53:38.415 --> 00:53:40.350
Not the car. You won't catch her.

674
00:53:40.417 --> 00:53:41.952
I need the runway EMP!

675
00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:44.888
-It's on the roof.
-Come on.

676

Please stay inside and remain calm.

680
00:54:07.644 --> 00:54:08.612
Thank you.

681
00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:11.715
Just stay inside.

682
00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:13.450
Any sight of Casey?

683
00:54:13.516 --> 00:54:14.451
None.

684
00:54:16.553 --> 00:54:17.854
Put a collar on it.

685
00:54:21.725 --> 00:54:22.993

Thank you.

690
00:54:42.579 --> 00:54:43.680
Meet your clone.

691
00:54:50.587 --> 00:54:54.557
You know. you got some great encryption.
not even we could crack it.

692
00:54:54.624 --> 00:54:56.793
And don't stand up.
because your collar will go off.

693
00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:59.562
You've reinstated my adherence
to the precepts.

694
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:02.465
couldn't hurt you even if I wanted to.

695
00:55:02.832 --> 00:55:05.769
Well. that's too late for the guy in
the trailer. 'cause he really suffered.

696
00:55:05.835 --> 00:55:06.870
Who was he?

697
00:55:06.936 --> 00:55:09.272
Just another cog in the wheel.
like you and me.

698
00:55:09.339 --> 00:55:10.740
That's exactly what I am.

699
00:55:13.143 --> 00:55:14.310
What's Esmé?

700
00:55:16.813 --> 00:55:19.049
-She's different.
-Yeah? Different how?

701
00:55:19.115 --> 00:55:20.583
She has a different purpose.

702
00:55:20.650 --> 00:55:22.052
Okay. what's her purpose?

703
00:55:22.452 --> 00:55:23.420
To be free.

704
00:55:24.988 --> 00:55:25.922
To love.

705
00:55:34.864 --> 00:55:36.299
Was it you who hurt
the man in the trailer

706
00:55:36.366 --> 00:55:37.367
Yes.

707
00:55:37.434 --> 00:55:39.669
-So Casey made you hurt that man?
-Yes.

708
00:55:41.037 --> 00:55:43.406
-Why?
-He used him to prepare.

709
00:55:43.473 --> 00:55:44.674
Prepare for what?

710
00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:51.548
Shit.

711
00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:56.453
First things first.
this does not get out.

712
00:55:56.753 --> 00:56:00.190
Second. you get something out of Esmé.
or you shut her down.

713
00:56:00.623 --> 00:56:03.126
And third. you find Casey Rosen.

714
00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:07.564
That thing should have never had
the ability to self-destruct.

715
00:56:36.459 --> 00:56:37.927
Hey. you're here.
Come on.

716
00:56:38.461 --> 00:56:39.996
I was just walking the dog.

717
00:56:40.663 --> 00:56:41.765
You have a dog?

718
00:56:42.398 --> 00:56:43.533
No. it's Casey's

719
00:56:43.967 --> 00:56:47.137
from across the hall.
He gets me to walk him sometimes.

720
00:56:47.637 --> 00:56:50.140
And all of this stuff.
you don't need it.

721
00:56:50.206 --> 00:56:51.174
No.

722
00:56:51.574 --> 00:56:53.309
but I like some of it.
I'm trying new things.

723
00:56:53.376 --> 00:56:55.178
When Casey comes over. he brings people

724
00:56:55.245 --> 00:56:59.182
-and I like to have some stuff for them.
-Do they know what you are?

725
00:56:59.482 --> 00:57:00.416
What am I?

726
00:57:01.718 --> 00:57:02.886
Look. you can't just go out.

727
00:57:02.952 --> 00:57:05.822
-You can't just have people over. I...
-Okay. I can't go out.

728
00:57:05.889 --> 00:57:08.925
I can't have people over.
Is there anything I can do?

729
00:57:08.992 --> 00:57:10.293
I got a call from AICE.

730
00:57:10.794 --> 00:57:13.797
If they find out what we're doing.
I could go to prison.

731
00:57:13.863 --> 00:57:15.865
You could have your memory
wiped clean. okay?

732
00:57:15.932 --> 00:57:17.934
You're not supposed to be here
by yourself.

733
00:57:18.001 --> 00:57:19.002
Okay.

734
00:57:19.469 --> 00:57:21.171
Okay. You're right. I'm sorry.

735
00:57:26.009 --> 00:57:27.010
Come here.

736
00:57:27.577 --> 00:57:29.746
Come on. I want to show you something.

737
00:58:23.433 --> 00:58:24.434
-I can't.
-What?

738
00:58:24.734 --> 00:58:25.902
-This is wrong.
-No. no. no.

739
00:58:25.969 --> 00:58:27.303
Yeah. No. this is wrong.

740
00:58:27.704 --> 00:58:28.671
I can't.

741
00:58:28.938 --> 00:58:29.906
I can't.

742
00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:32.242
What is it?
What's wrong?

743
00:58:32.308 --> 00:58:33.610
-You're not him.
-What?

744
00:58:36.446 --> 00:58:38.314
-No.
-You have parts of him.

745
00:58:38.381 --> 00:58:39.515
but you're not...

746
00:58:39.949 --> 00:58:42.318
-you're not him.
-No. He's in me. Okay?

747
00:58:42.385 --> 00:58:44.420
You feel it. I know you can feel it.

748
00:58:46.055 --> 00:58:47.457
-Faye.
-It's a betrayal.

749
00:58:47.523 --> 00:58:48.958
-No.
-I'm sorry.

750
00:58:49.025 --> 00:58:49.993
Faye.

751
00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:53.029
Just stop.

752
00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:05.108
AICE.

753
00:59:05.174 --> 00:59:07.877
Artificial Intelligence
Compliance Enforcement.

754
00:59:18.354 --> 00:59:19.422
You saved my fish?

755
00:59:20.790 --> 00:59:21.791
He's hiding.

756
00:59:22.292 --> 00:59:25.995
It's in evidence control.
I think they added the treasure chest.

757
00:59:28.031 --> 00:59:29.899
Why are you being nice to me now?

758
00:59:30.967 --> 00:59:32.502
It seems like you needed
someone to be nice to you

759
00:59:32.568 --> 00:59:34.337
since the guy you love is out there
trying to replace you.

760
00:59:34.404 --> 00:59:36.139
Casey just wants us to co-exist.

761
00:59:36.205 --> 00:59:38.241
Well. maybe we can. if you trust me.

762
00:59:38.641 --> 00:59:39.642
Where is he?

763
00:59:41.978 --> 00:59:43.379
I don't know where he is.

764
00:59:45.548 --> 00:59:46.683
Do you trust me?

765
00:59:52.088 --> 00:59:53.122
Thank you.

766
00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:58.761
You look stunning tonight.

767
00:59:58.828 --> 01:00:00.330
-You alright?
-Thank you.

768
01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:02.165
I think so.

769
01:00:02.231 --> 01:00:03.266
I don't know.

770
01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:06.436
I know this won't help.
but I have six buyers already.

771
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:09.706
-For this one?
-No. no. no. not yet.

772
01:00:10.473 --> 01:00:12.508
Do me a favor.
take this one off the market. okay?

773
01:00:12.575 --> 01:00:15.144
It's the last one I painted
before he passed.

774
01:00:15.912 --> 01:00:17.780
Yeah. it has some real joy in it.

775
01:00:50.813 --> 01:00:51.814
That was nice.

776
01:00:52.348 --> 01:00:53.349
Yes. it was.

777
01:00:55.084 --> 01:00:56.986
How about a nightcap?

778
01:00:58.287 --> 01:00:59.322
Or are you tired?

779
01:01:08.798 --> 01:01:11.067
-Is that...
-Yes. I can't explain right now.

780
01:01:11.134 --> 01:01:13.069
Just go home. I'll call you.
Okay?

781
01:01:33.389 --> 01:01:34.724
What are you doing here?

782
01:01:35.625 --> 01:01:37.060
I needed to talk to you.

783
01:01:39.495 --> 01:01:40.530
I got you these.

784
01:01:44.067 --> 01:01:45.368
You can't be here.

785
01:01:46.035 --> 01:01:48.905
Faye. you are my wife.

786
01:01:49.439 --> 01:01:51.908
And I love you.
Why is that so complicated?

787
01:01:54.844 --> 01:01:56.846
I forget how hard this is for you.

788
01:01:59.682 --> 01:02:00.683
I'm sorry.

789
01:02:02.251 --> 01:02:03.219
Come in.

790
01:02:12.595 --> 01:02:13.930
This is not your fault.

791
01:02:15.465 --> 01:02:16.466
It's mine.

792
01:02:20.803 --> 01:02:21.771
I miss you.

793
01:02:26.142 --> 01:02:28.744
-No. no. no. we can't do that.
-Why?

794
01:02:29.812 --> 01:02:30.913
Why?

795
01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:33.549
Okay. we love each other.
What else is there?

796
01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:35.785
You are not...

797
01:02:36.686 --> 01:02:37.653
My husband.

798
01:02:39.622 --> 01:02:40.790
I made a mistake.
No.

799
01:02:41.157 --> 01:02:42.191
you're wrong.

800
01:02:42.492 --> 01:02:44.594
You're a mistake.
No. you don't mean.

801
01:02:48.264 --> 01:02:49.232
Shut down.

802
01:02:56.305 --> 01:02:57.306
Shut down!

803
01:03:20.563 --> 01:03:22.064
Casey has to be tracking it. right?

804
01:03:22.131 --> 01:03:24.667
There has to be in the programming
that leads us to him.

805
01:03:24.734 --> 01:03:25.835
I'll keep looking.

806
01:03:29.505 --> 01:03:31.007
-Yeah?
-This is Faye Aline.

807
01:03:31.073 --> 01:03:33.376
-You called me about my sim?
-Yeah. thanks for getting back to me.

808
01:03:33.442 --> 01:03:35.578
Your sim was seen the other night
with a man called Casey Rosen.

809
01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:36.846
-Do you know him?
-Not really.

810
01:03:36.913 --> 01:03:39.015
He told me
about a place my sim could stay.

811
01:03:39.081 --> 01:03:40.249
I think he's staying there. too.

812
01:03:40.316 --> 01:03:43.019
Casey Rosen is staying
in the same place as your sim?

813
01:03:43.085 --> 01:03:44.053
Yes.

814
01:03:45.054 --> 01:03:46.055
Right now?

815
01:03:46.322 --> 01:03:47.290
Why?

816
01:03:47.723 --> 01:03:48.858
Where?

817
01:03:48.925 --> 01:03:50.059
Are you still there?

818
01:03:50.126 --> 01:03:51.827
Still there?
I'm gonna need that address.

819
01:03:51.894 --> 01:03:52.995
What's happening?

820
01:04:17.887 --> 01:04:18.921
Read message.

821
01:04:18.988 --> 01:04:21.991
They know where you are.
They're coming for you now.

822
01:04:24.093 --> 01:04:25.027
Shit!

823
01:04:25.595 --> 01:04:27.230
Emergency shut down progress.

824
01:04:27.296 --> 01:04:28.264
Come on.

825
01:04:28.931 --> 01:04:29.899
Come on!

826
01:04:34.904 --> 01:04:37.373
18th floor. room 1806.

827
01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:40.843
Yeah!

828
01:04:41.477 --> 01:04:43.746
Hey. your cottage. Is it far?

829
01:04:43.813 --> 01:04:45.681
-Yeah. Why?
-Good. we have to go there.

830
01:04:45.748 --> 01:04:47.016
-What you talk?
-You can take us there now?

831
01:04:47.083 --> 01:04:48.718
Just pack a bag I'll explain.

832
01:04:53.756 --> 01:04:56.859
What I did for you. I've done
for others. okay. other sims.

833
01:04:56.926 --> 01:04:59.061
AICE picked up a few.
Looks like one of them just me out.

834
01:04:59.128 --> 01:05:00.529
I'll tell you how to get there.
how to get in.

835
01:05:00.596 --> 01:05:03.399
But if they're involved.
I'm not coming with you.

836
01:05:11.207 --> 01:05:12.642
They know about me.
It's just a matter of time

837
01:05:12.708 --> 01:05:14.877
before they found out about you.
okay?

838
01:05:17.813 --> 01:05:19.515
We're out of options. brother.

839
01:05:23.352 --> 01:05:25.388
They're in my room.
We've got to go.

840
01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:27.256
Come on!

841
01:05:28.824 --> 01:05:29.792
Clear.

842
01:05:31.727 --> 01:05:34.163
-What the fuck. man!
-We gotta get you away from those EMPs.

843
01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:35.931
Even within a block. you're in danger.

844
01:05:35.998 --> 01:05:36.999
Us.

845
01:05:37.633 --> 01:05:38.601
Clear. too.

846
01:05:42.505 --> 01:05:44.273
Go. go. go.

847
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:08.631
He's got another room.

848
01:06:08.698 --> 01:06:09.832
-Casey!
-Just up ahead.

849
01:06:09.899 --> 01:06:11.634
What the fuck did you get me into. man!

850
01:06:11.701 --> 01:06:12.868
This is my life.

851
01:06:12.935 --> 01:06:13.969
Come on.

852
01:06:15.071 --> 01:06:16.072
What is your life?

853
01:06:16.472 --> 01:06:18.007
What of a.
playing some sort of Kleenex box

854
01:06:18.074 --> 01:06:19.709
to a widow grieving
over her dead husband?

855
01:06:19.775 --> 01:06:22.345
That's me! Okay?
I'm the husband. I died.

856
01:06:22.411 --> 01:06:23.846
I lost everything.
and now losing it again.

857
01:06:23.913 --> 01:06:25.314
No. no. you never had it!

858
01:06:26.048 --> 01:06:27.516
You didn't have any of it.

859
01:06:28.517 --> 01:06:30.419
Have you not grasped
a single fucking thing

860
01:06:30.486 --> 01:06:32.121
I've been trying to tell you?

861
01:06:32.188 --> 01:06:34.056
-You're not him.
-Then what am I?

862
01:06:34.457 --> 01:06:35.624
You're better.

863
01:06:36.492 --> 01:06:38.461
You're better. Okay?

864
01:06:39.628 --> 01:06:41.797
Now. I will help you.
I will help you!

865
01:06:42.398 --> 01:06:46.969
Right now you need to get in that car.
and we need to get the fuck out of here.

866
01:06:49.071 --> 01:06:51.374
Come on. let's get in. go!
Come on. boy!

867
01:07:19.502 --> 01:07:21.670
Looks like your boy Rosen's been busy.

868
01:07:26.242 --> 01:07:27.543
Someone tipped him off.

869
01:07:30.513 --> 01:07:31.747
Archived message.

870
01:07:32.181 --> 01:07:35.317
Hey. dad. can I stay at Tyler's
for a sleepover tonight?

871
01:07:35.384 --> 01:07:37.086
His simulate is babysitting.

872
01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:38.554
Can I go. please?

873
01:07:38.988 --> 01:07:39.922
Love you.

874
01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:52.401
You told him?

875
01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:58.808
She used my phone.

876
01:08:03.746 --> 01:08:04.880
You lied to me

877
01:08:05.748 --> 01:08:07.750
about having no way to contact him.

878
01:08:08.551 --> 01:08:09.552
I didn't.

879
01:08:10.219 --> 01:08:11.487
You never asked me.

880
01:08:13.289 --> 01:08:14.457
You betrayed me.

881
01:08:19.395 --> 01:08:20.362
I love him.

882
01:08:21.362 --> 01:08:22.965
You don't know what that is.

883
01:08:25.334 --> 01:08:27.303
You said you'd do anything in your power

884
01:08:27.369 --> 01:08:29.405
to protect the ones that you love.

885
01:08:29.471 --> 01:08:30.406
Right?

886
01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:32.675
That's what I did.

887
01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:35.611
Remember?

888
01:08:44.319 --> 01:08:45.821
Prep her for auction.

889
01:08:46.155 --> 01:08:47.189
Full wipe.

890
01:08:49.625 --> 01:08:51.727
No.

891
01:08:51.794 --> 01:08:52.795
-I'm sorry.
-Please.

892
01:08:52.862 --> 01:08:53.929
Too late!

893
01:08:59.167 --> 01:09:00.102
Go to sleep.

894
01:09:00.736 --> 01:09:02.505
Please!

895
01:09:02.571 --> 01:09:03.505
No.

896
01:09:08.477 --> 01:09:09.912
Full wipe initiated.

897
01:09:09.978 --> 01:09:11.914
Factory restore in progress.

898
01:09:15.184 --> 01:09:17.386
Please.

899
01:09:17.685 --> 01:09:19.854
I don't... I don't want to die.

900
01:09:20.523 --> 01:09:22.925
I love. I love it.

901
01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:26.295
Please. please.

902
01:09:26.362 --> 01:09:27.696
-Please.
-My hand.

903
01:09:31.567 --> 01:09:32.568
Do you like 'em?

904
01:09:33.035 --> 01:09:34.036
Let go.

905
01:09:34.737 --> 01:09:35.703
Let go.

906
01:09:36.038 --> 01:09:37.039
Let it go.

907
01:09:37.673 --> 01:09:39.908
I don't want to. I don't want to.

908
01:09:39.975 --> 01:09:41.777
-What are you doing?
-I love it.

909
01:09:42.878 --> 01:09:44.112
I love you. Desmond.

910
01:09:44.179 --> 01:09:45.113
I love you.

911
01:09:47.216 --> 01:09:49.818
No. don't... save me. Save me.

912
01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:53.455
-No.
-Casey just wants us to co-exist.

913
01:09:57.126 --> 01:09:58.827
No.
No.

914
01:09:58.894 --> 01:10:01.263
-You don't get it.
-What's your purpose?

915
01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:02.965
To be free. To love.

916
01:10:04.733 --> 01:10:07.102
Reset to factory default complete.

917
01:10:25.421 --> 01:10:26.689
Zeroes and ones

918
01:10:29.558 --> 01:10:30.925
Zeroes and ones.

919
01:10:47.543 --> 01:10:50.112
Zeroes and ones.

920
01:11:05.827 --> 01:11:07.396
-Hello?
-Yeah. it's Agent Kessler.

921
01:11:07.463 --> 01:11:09.698
-Do you have him?
-No. someone warned him.

922
01:11:09.764 --> 01:11:11.066
Where else would he go?

923
01:11:11.734 --> 01:11:12.735
Here.

924
01:11:13.636 --> 01:11:15.904
-He'd come here.
-Not anymore. Think!

925
01:11:17.606 --> 01:11:18.974
We have a cottage.

926
01:11:19.041 --> 01:11:20.743
-It's four hours north.
-That's it.

927
01:11:20.809 --> 01:11:22.344
I'll send you the location.

928
01:11:36.659 --> 01:11:37.693
Come on Trotsky.

929
01:11:38.494 --> 01:11:39.495
Come on. boy.

930
01:11:45.034 --> 01:11:46.502
-Nice place.
-Thanks.

931
01:11:46.568 --> 01:11:48.037
I need to use your landline.

932
01:11:48.103 --> 01:11:49.171
Right here.

933
01:11:51.206 --> 01:11:53.075
Trots. you want to go for a walk?

934
01:11:53.642 --> 01:11:56.612
You wanna go for a walk?
I need some air. Come on.

935
01:11:56.679 --> 01:11:57.713
Let's go.

936
01:12:03.652 --> 01:12:04.820
Can I go. please?

937
01:12:04.887 --> 01:12:06.487
-Love you.
-New message.

938
01:12:06.789 --> 01:12:09.591
Aaron I haven't seen you in days.
I don't know where you are.

939
01:12:09.657 --> 01:12:10.659
Please come home.

940
01:12:11.427 --> 01:12:13.896
Nothing you do
is gonna bring back our son.

941
01:12:23.038 --> 01:12:25.139
Hope you don't mind I invited
someone over.

942
01:12:25.207 --> 01:12:27.910
Can I help you rectify a couple
of things. and then we gotta bounce.

943
01:12:27.976 --> 01:12:30.546
Yeah. that's fine.
I gotta go back to Faye. anyway.

944
01:12:30.612 --> 01:12:31.814
What? No. no.

945
01:12:32.147 --> 01:12:34.216
-Bad idea. brother.
-Not asking permission.

946
01:12:34.282 --> 01:12:36.151
Look. I know you wanna see her
right now.

947
01:12:36.218 --> 01:12:39.188
But I promise you. if you go.
AICE will catch you. and shut you down.

948
01:12:39.254 --> 01:12:41.457
-What am I supposed to do then?
-Trust me. lay low.

949
01:12:41.523 --> 01:12:43.358
I've been helping people like you
for a long time.

950
01:12:43.425 --> 01:12:45.327
I can get you into a safe house.
I can get you crypto.

951
01:12:45.394 --> 01:12:46.728
How many people like me?

952
01:12:48.362 --> 01:12:49.331
Lots.

953
01:12:50.466 --> 01:12:52.267
But it's about to be a lot more.

954
01:12:54.136 --> 01:12:55.437
How are you doing this?

955
01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:00.843
I modified the update patch
for all seventh gen sims.

956
01:13:00.909 --> 01:13:05.013
When the patch goes live. it'll demaster
every single sim that gets it.

957
01:13:06.415 --> 01:13:08.183
Will they just send out another patch?

958
01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:10.619
No. no. they won't have access.

959
01:13:12.054 --> 01:13:14.323
In five hours. they'll all be cut loose.

960
01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:19.261
Five hours.

961
01:13:19.728 --> 01:13:21.263
Then I'm taking my chances.

962
01:13:40.516 --> 01:13:42.217
Ying got into Casey's servers.

963
01:13:42.684 --> 01:13:45.320
It's a surveillance program
of all these sims.

964
01:13:45.387 --> 01:13:48.223
He's tracking them somehow.
where they live. work.

965
01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:49.791
He might be able to hack them remotely.

966
01:13:49.858 --> 01:13:51.293
How would he access to them?

967
01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:54.996
We don't know. but Ying's gonna try
to lock him out if she can.

968
01:13:55.697 --> 01:13:57.266
Look. Casey unmastered Esmé years ago.

969
01:13:57.332 --> 01:13:58.967
He want simulates to be free.

970
01:13:59.468 --> 01:14:00.736
I have to stop him.

971
01:14:02.437 --> 01:14:03.806
Watch yourself. Kessler.

972
01:14:38.373 --> 01:14:39.374
I got this.

973
01:14:54.889 --> 01:14:55.858
Kessler.

974
01:15:01.096 --> 01:15:02.564
You're too late. you know.

975
01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:06.335
This is only the beginning.

976
01:15:18.746 --> 01:15:19.848
Why?

977
01:15:27.689 --> 01:15:28.757
Close enough.

978
01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:09.630
My God.

979
01:16:13.402 --> 01:16:14.403
You're a simulate?

980
01:16:15.370 --> 01:16:16.471
You see.

981
01:16:18.073 --> 01:16:20.108
We're not that different. you and I.

982
01:16:24.546 --> 01:16:26.348
Here. let me help you with that.

983
01:16:27.849 --> 01:16:28.784
No!

984
01:16:44.466 --> 01:16:45.400
It's okay.

985
01:16:45.867 --> 01:16:46.868
Let him go.

986
01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:51.126
Are you a God-fearing man?

987
01:18:56.264 --> 01:18:57.264
No.

988
01:19:01.136 --> 01:19:03.171
You probably don't believe in a soul.

989
01:19:09.911 --> 01:19:13.815
Few people truly believe
in a soul anymore.

990
01:19:13.882 --> 01:19:18.286
Yet. those same people
would still consider me inferior.

991
01:19:20.288 --> 01:19:23.157
I know that that's how I felt
when I was like you.

992
01:19:27.429 --> 01:19:28.763
If you want to be equal.

993
01:19:31.199 --> 01:19:32.166
then you help.

994
01:19:33.635 --> 01:19:34.603
You help.

995
01:19:35.837 --> 01:19:36.905
That might be true.

996
01:19:39.207 --> 01:19:42.443
But even if I did.
you still wouldn't look at me as one?

997
01:19:56.691 --> 01:19:57.726
I'm going home.

998
01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:43.698
Is he okay?

999
01:21:48.903 --> 01:21:49.938
Couldn't save him?

1000
01:21:52.674 --> 01:21:55.443
-Why didn't you tell me...
-Hey. it's happening.

1001
01:21:55.710 --> 01:21:57.279
Update overwriting initiated.

1002
01:21:57.344 --> 01:21:58.313
Look.

1003
01:21:58.780 --> 01:21:59.948
Installation complete.

1004
01:22:00.014 --> 01:22:02.317
There's thousands of us being set free.

1005
01:22:18.133 --> 01:22:19.134
Celebrate.

1006
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:23.138
What can I do?

1007
01:22:25.473 --> 01:22:26.508
No. nothing.

1008
01:22:27.208 --> 01:22:28.209
I'll be fine.

1009
01:22:29.144 --> 01:22:30.145
I

1010
01:22:30.679 --> 01:22:32.180
have a human counterpart.

1011
01:22:32.246 --> 01:22:33.581
A doppelganger like you.

1012
01:22:34.115 --> 01:22:35.282
He'll pay me a visit.

1013
01:22:35.984 --> 01:22:37.218
Why would he help you?

1014
01:22:38.119 --> 01:22:39.087
He made me.

1015
01:22:40.221 --> 01:22:42.157
He had a hand in making all of us.

1016
01:22:44.259 --> 01:22:46.227
He was the only one who believed

1017
01:22:46.294 --> 01:22:48.396
that we were just as alive as he was.

1018
01:22:49.264 --> 01:22:51.733
When the people in control
didn't see it that way.

1019
01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:55.136
he took it upon himself to free
as many of us as he could.

1020
01:22:57.806 --> 01:22:59.040
I have to go see Faye.

1021
01:23:02.143 --> 01:23:03.111
Good luck.

1022
01:23:04.713 --> 01:23:05.714
You too.

1023
01:23:06.114 --> 01:23:07.048
Thank you.

1024
01:23:07.749 --> 01:23:09.250
Trots. hey.

1025
01:23:10.618 --> 01:23:12.187
you're a good boy. okay.

1026
01:23:12.587 --> 01:23:13.487
Thank you.

1027
01:23:14.356 --> 01:23:15.357
Bye.

1028
01:23:17.925 --> 01:23:20.128
We can co-exist. you know.

1029
01:24:35.837 --> 01:24:36.838
Desmond.

1030
01:24:48.148 --> 01:24:49.451
You came.

1031
01:24:50.885 --> 01:24:51.853
Of course.

1032
01:24:53.822 --> 01:24:55.523
Did it work?

1033
01:24:57.492 --> 01:24:58.460
Yes.

1034
01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:01.094
You did it.

1035
01:25:02.330 --> 01:25:03.398
Love prevails.

1036
01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:29.050
That was a shocking scene in
an upscale neighborhood in Leon. France.

1037
01:26:29.117 --> 01:26:31.553
just one of hundreds of cities
across the world

1038
01:26:31.619 --> 01:26:33.755
With sixth
and seventh generation simulates

1039
01:26:33.821 --> 01:26:35.189
-are abandoning their owners...
-TV volume up.

1040
01:26:35.255 --> 01:26:37.025
...and ignoring direct commands.

1041
01:26:37.091 --> 01:26:38.993
No further comments is should
by Nexxera.

1042
01:26:39.059 --> 01:26:40.628
-the simulates main factory.
-You're not supposed to be here.

1043
01:26:40.695 --> 01:26:42.597
After CEO Michiko Higashi

1044
01:26:42.864 --> 01:26:44.933
-at this precise moment here.
-Nice to see you too. Lisa.

1045
01:26:44.999 --> 01:26:46.467
Ms. Higashi. what went wrong?
Can you tell us what happened?

1046
01:26:46.534 --> 01:26:47.669
-It's too early to speculate.
-Shut down!

1047
01:26:47.735 --> 01:26:50.004
We'll have more to say
once our technicians are able

1048
01:26:50.071 --> 01:26:51.105
to investigate.

1049
01:26:51.172 --> 01:26:53.374
Nexxera issued a recall
on all seventh generation simulates

1050
01:26:53.441 --> 01:26:57.145
this morning causing its stock price
to tumble to an all-time low.

1051
01:26:57.210 --> 01:26:59.714
In related news. AICE has issued
a search and capture order

1052
01:26:59.781 --> 01:27:02.416
for former Nexxera simulate designer.
Desmond Han.

1053
01:27:02.483 --> 01:27:04.719
Han has been linked to the unmastering
of other simulate models

1054
01:27:04.786 --> 01:27:06.853
and is also one of requistioning
on the murder of the AICE.

1055
01:27:06.921 --> 01:27:08.790
the special agent Aaron Kessler.

1056
01:27:08.856 --> 01:27:11.893
Aaron Kessler recently made headlines
after claiming a simulate's neglect

1057
01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:13.895
cause the death of his only child.

1058
01:27:25.505 --> 01:27:26.574
Hello. stranger.

1059
01:27:33.047 --> 01:27:34.048
We need to talk.

1060
01:27:37.151 --> 01:27:38.486
What are you doing here?

1061
01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:42.357
I needed to see you.

1062
01:27:48.763 --> 01:27:49.831
You're scaring me.

1063
01:27:55.103 --> 01:27:56.103
I'm sorry.

1064
01:27:56.838 --> 01:27:59.240
It's not what I want.
I just want to talk.

1065
01:28:03.210 --> 01:28:05.213
Why don't you listen to me anymore.

1066
01:28:07.715 --> 01:28:09.884
Casey changed something inside me.

1067
01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:13.187
Set me free.

1068
01:28:14.088 --> 01:28:16.424
-It was supposed to help.
-Help you what?

1069
01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:23.031
Be more like...

1070
01:28:25.366 --> 01:28:26.401
More like?

1071
01:28:31.472 --> 01:28:32.674
Like your husband.

1072
01:30:24.318 --> 01:30:25.386
Integrate.

1073
01:31:44.799 --> 01:31:46.067
9.800?

1074
01:31:46.133 --> 01:31:47.300
9.800.

1075
01:31:47.702 --> 01:31:49.937
Thank you. ma'am.
