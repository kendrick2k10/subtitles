00:08:51.835 --> 00:08:53.054
and biofeedback.

20
00:08:55.883 --> 00:08:58.755
Anything else?Probably.

21
00:08:59.495 --> 00:09:03.847
And none of these
traditional forms of treatment
have proven effective?

22
00:09:04.021 --> 00:09:07.198
No. no. Um. that's
actually why I'm here.

23
00:09:07.372 --> 00:09:11.638
You know. what you described
in your intake forms.
a recurring dream.

24
00:09:11.812 --> 00:09:16.730
is not all that unusual
a phenomenon in and of itself.

25
00:09:16.904 --> 00:09:22.779
Well. I've had this dream
4.476 times.

26
00:09:25.303 --> 00:09:28.568
Yes. that part is a bit unusual.

27
00:09:32.963 --> 00:09:37.272
Have you ever encountered
a condition like mine?

28
00:09:38.012 --> 00:09:39.579
Well. most of my patients

29
00:09:39.753 --> 00:09:43.321
are suffering from more common
sleep disorders.

30
00:09:44.279 --> 00:09:48.675
Insomnia. parasomnia.
hypersomnias.

31
00:09:50.198 --> 00:09:51.242
Right.

32
00:09:53.201 --> 00:09:54.942
Most of my patients.

33
00:09:57.205 --> 00:10:00.687
To answer your question.
yes. I have treated a few people

34
00:10:00.861 --> 00:10:05.256
who were experiencing
symptoms like yours.

35
00:10:08.433 --> 00:10:10.914
How like mine?

36
00:10:12.524 --> 00:10:13.874
Very.

37
00:10:17.138 --> 00:10:21.055
There is a treatment
I have administered in the past.

38
00:10:21.229 --> 00:10:25.537
a form of hypnosis.
for lack of a better term.

39
00:10:25.712 --> 00:10:28.584
which greatly assisted
those others I mentioned

40
00:10:28.758 --> 00:10:32.109
who were suffering
from a similar defect.

41
00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.024
Defect?

42
00:10:34.198 --> 00:10:36.418
Sorry. poor choice of words.

43
00:10:36.592 --> 00:10:40.248
The treatment is very effective.

44
00:10:40.422 --> 00:10:43.773
It will eliminate
your recurring dream.

45
00:10:44.731 --> 00:10:48.169
You know that
other therapists before.
they said that they could help.

46
00:10:49.736 --> 00:10:52.042
but nothing ever changed.

47
00:10:52.913 --> 00:10:54.349
I will help you.

48
00:10:55.393 --> 00:10:57.134
The dream will go away.

49
00:10:59.441 --> 00:11:01.530
But...But?

50
00:11:03.358 --> 00:11:05.839
Unless we have
a thorough understanding

51
00:11:06.013 --> 00:11:08.319
of why you are having it.

52
00:11:08.493 --> 00:11:11.322
after some time has passed.

53
00:11:11.496 --> 00:11:13.107
the dream will come back.

54
00:11:13.934 --> 00:11:15.892
Okay. so how do we--
Like you said.

55
00:11:16.066 --> 00:11:18.199
I mean. how do we figure out
why I'm having it?

56
00:11:19.461 --> 00:11:22.290
Well. we start
by having you recount it for me

57
00:11:22.464 --> 00:11:25.206
in as much detail as possible.

58
00:11:27.338 --> 00:11:30.211
It. uh-- It takes place
in the house where I grew up.

59
00:11:30.385 --> 00:11:33.431
It can help sometimes
to close your eyes.

60
00:11:39.002 --> 00:11:42.789
Okay. so like I said.

61
00:11:42.963 --> 00:11:45.313
I'm in the house
where I grew up.

62
00:11:45.879 --> 00:11:47.489
I'm in the kitchen.

63
00:11:48.533 --> 00:11:50.579
My mom is there cooking dinner.

64
00:11:51.841 --> 00:11:55.323
She asks me
if I can run and ask my dad

65
00:11:55.497 --> 00:11:58.413
if he remembered to get garlic
when he went to the store.

66
00:11:58.587 --> 00:12:01.198
Sorry to interrupt.
Is this a memory?

67
00:12:01.372 --> 00:12:04.724
I don't really know. I. uh--

68
00:12:04.898 --> 00:12:08.379
Probably. I-I used to watch
my mom cook sometimes. but...

69
00:12:09.685 --> 00:12:12.601
Interesting. Go on.

70
00:12:13.384 --> 00:12:15.256
Uh. eyes open or closed?

71
00:12:16.431 --> 00:12:17.475
Up to you.

72
00:12:19.651 --> 00:12:20.696
Okay.

73
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:23.525
Uh. so...

74
00:12:25.222 --> 00:12:28.704
then I run down the hallway...

75
00:12:28.878 --> 00:12:31.141
...to the bedroom...

76
00:12:31.315 --> 00:12:34.666
...and my dad is there
watching football on TV.

77
00:12:44.067 --> 00:12:45.199
And?

78
00:12:45.373 --> 00:12:46.417
And that's it. That's--

79
00:12:46.591 --> 00:12:47.941
That's where I wake up.

80
00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.862
It is extremely mundane.

81
00:12:57.515 --> 00:12:59.256
There is
one strange thing about it.

82
00:13:00.518 --> 00:13:01.563
What is it?

83
00:13:04.653 --> 00:13:07.264
It's this--
The thing is.

84
00:13:07.438 --> 00:13:09.919
before I get to the bedroom.
there-- there's...

85
00:13:12.356 --> 00:13:15.055
Hanging from the ceiling
is a red string.

86
00:13:16.317 --> 00:13:17.622
An attic?

87
00:13:19.146 --> 00:13:21.322
Yeah.Why is that strange?

88
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:25.717
Because there was no attic
in the house where I grew up.

89
00:13:27.502 --> 00:13:28.895
You're certain of this?

90
00:13:30.679 --> 00:13:34.944
Yes.Could there have been one
and you were just unaware of it?

91
00:13:35.118 --> 00:13:38.513
I mean. I-I lived
in that house for 18 years.

92
00:13:38.687 --> 00:13:41.472
You know. I-I ran up and down
the hallway a thousand times.

93
00:13:43.344 --> 00:13:45.955
Uh. when I was 14 or so

94
00:13:46.129 --> 00:13:49.524
and the dream was driving me
fucking crazy.
I actually got a ladder

95
00:13:49.698 --> 00:13:53.571
and I took a hammer
to the ceiling
right in that spot.

96
00:13:53.745 --> 00:13:56.009
I just tore open the drywall.

97
00:13:56.183 --> 00:13:57.488
but I didn't find anything.

98
00:13:57.662 --> 00:14:02.015
Just insulation and wood.

99
00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:08.151
I see.

100
00:14:13.678 --> 00:14:15.245
So. um...

101
00:14:16.943 --> 00:14:18.553
that's why I'm here.

102
00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:24.864
Yes.

103
00:14:26.387 --> 00:14:27.388
It is.

104
00:14:44.492 --> 00:14:46.320
Here you go. Thank you.

105
00:15:14.783 --> 00:15:16.350
I'm sorry to bother you.

106
00:15:16.524 --> 00:15:19.614
My name is Harrison Hardy.
I'm moving in today.

107
00:15:21.268 --> 00:15:22.922
We spoke on the phone last week.

108
00:15:23.096 --> 00:15:25.402
Actually. I have
my security deposit here.

109
00:15:28.536 --> 00:15:29.929
I don't remember.

110
00:15:31.626 --> 00:15:33.671
Oh. yeah.

111
00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:37.588
I remember now. Ah. Hold on.

112
00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:41.331
Huh.

113
00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.726
Come with me.

114
00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.108
What-- I thought you said
it was furnished.

115
00:16:19.282 --> 00:16:20.414
Well. there's a bed.

116
00:16:21.676 --> 00:16:22.807
and a fridge.

117
00:16:24.113 --> 00:16:25.158
toilet.

118
00:16:26.289 --> 00:16:28.030
What you fucking want?
Martha Stewart?

119
00:16:28.204 --> 00:16:29.379
No. you're right. It's great.

120
00:16:29.553 --> 00:16:31.077
It's. uh--
It's perfect. actually.

121
00:16:31.251 --> 00:16:33.166
Um. where's the laundry room?

122
00:16:34.732 --> 00:16:35.907
Basement.

123
00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:37.997
Thanks.

124
00:16:39.302 --> 00:16:40.260
See ya!

125
00:16:41.217 --> 00:16:43.306
See ya.

126
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:45.091
Oh.

127
00:16:47.136 --> 00:16:51.836
Did you hear or read anything

128
00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:54.274
about this building online?

129
00:16:56.276 --> 00:17:01.803
Um. just that it was cheap
and furnished.

130
00:17:51.722 --> 00:17:52.941
Mmm.

131
00:17:54.682 --> 00:17:56.292
Fuck that.

132
00:18:18.619 --> 00:18:20.316
Fuck that.

133
00:18:50.216 --> 00:18:52.043
Harrison. can you go
ask your dad

134
00:18:52.218 --> 00:18:53.480
if he remembered to get garlic

135
00:18:53.654 --> 00:18:55.134
when he went
to the grocery store?

136
00:19:29.864 --> 00:19:30.908
Okay.

137
00:19:33.259 --> 00:19:35.565
It is half past- 00.
I'm gonna move your clothes.

138
00:19:35.739 --> 00:19:38.307
That's it. I cannot wait
all day for this shit.

139
00:19:45.227 --> 00:19:47.751
Ten more minutes.
Ten more minutes.

140
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:14.952
I mean. would I be pissed? No.

141
00:20:15.126 --> 00:20:18.217
But then I would come
get my clothes out
when they're done.

142
00:20:19.174 --> 00:20:20.567
What are you gonna do.
leave them in there all day?

143
00:20:20.741 --> 00:20:23.134
They're just gonna get
mildewy and gross.

144
00:20:23.918 --> 00:20:26.573
Yeah. all right. Yeah.
I'd totally understand.

145
00:20:27.443 --> 00:20:31.708
I would totally understand.
I'd get it. I'd love that. Okay.

146
00:20:42.328 --> 00:20:43.633
Is that my laundry?

147
00:20:43.807 --> 00:20:46.027
Oh. my God. I'm so sorry.
I was just--

148
00:20:46.201 --> 00:20:47.289
I was gonna move
it to the dryer--

149
00:21:00.911 --> 00:21:02.173
Are you okay?

150
00:21:04.088 --> 00:21:06.526
Yeah. I-- Sorry. Um--

151
00:21:08.397 --> 00:21:09.746
I'm Maria.

152
00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.401
You must be Harrison Hardy.

153
00:21:13.881 --> 00:21:15.099
What?

154
00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:17.493
The new tenant in 429?

155
00:21:18.538 --> 00:21:19.800
Um. yeah.

156
00:21:20.714 --> 00:21:21.932
I'm in 630.

157
00:21:22.629 --> 00:21:24.370
Right above you. two floors up.

158
00:21:25.632 --> 00:21:29.288
May I?Oh. Yeah. Yeah.

159
00:21:32.856 --> 00:21:35.032
How are we liking
the Lafayette so far?

160
00:21:35.598 --> 00:21:37.644
Um... You know. it's. uh--

161
00:21:38.949 --> 00:21:40.864
it's a little strange.
to be honest.

162
00:21:41.038 --> 00:21:42.083
Hmm.

163
00:21:43.693 --> 00:21:46.305
So. where are you from. Harry?

164
00:21:47.523 --> 00:21:48.916
Uh. Riverside.

165
00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:50.439
Oh. Never been.

166
00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:53.573
Know anyone in the city?

167
00:21:54.922 --> 00:21:56.140
Well. I know you.

168
00:21:57.925 --> 00:22:02.625
Well. I'm very interested
to know how you ended up
at the Lafayette.

169
00:22:02.799 --> 00:22:07.804
Um. well. I just--
I was looking for a place
that was cheap and furnished.

170
00:22:07.978 --> 00:22:10.067
Well. I know what it's like
being new in town.

171
00:22:10.938 --> 00:22:12.548
You don't know anybody.

172
00:22:13.244 --> 00:22:14.463
Lonely. sad.

173
00:22:16.117 --> 00:22:19.729
Um. so. if you want to come up
to my place later.

174
00:22:19.903 --> 00:22:22.471
maybe have some dinner
and some drinks. I can...

175
00:22:24.081 --> 00:22:26.519
answer any questions
you have about this place.

176
00:22:26.693 --> 00:22:28.042
Oh. yeah. I mean--

177
00:22:29.348 --> 00:22:31.611
Yeah. that-- that--
that sounds great.
That'd be really nice.

178
00:22:31.785 --> 00:22:33.700
You eat meat?Yeah.

179
00:22:33.874 --> 00:22:35.354
Or unless you don't.
I don't have to.

180
00:22:35.528 --> 00:22:36.964
I love meat.

181
00:22:37.965 --> 00:22:38.966
I'll make steaks.

182
00:22:40.924 --> 00:22:41.969
Great.

183
00:22:51.761 --> 00:22:52.762
Good evening.

184
00:23:38.982 --> 00:23:40.331
Harry.Hey.

185
00:23:42.333 --> 00:23:43.378
Come in.

186
00:23:50.341 --> 00:23:52.300
Welcome to my place.
Would you like the tour?

187
00:23:53.127 --> 00:23:54.171
Sure.

188
00:24:13.539 --> 00:24:14.583
You like that. huh?

189
00:24:15.584 --> 00:24:17.151
It's been in my family
for generations.

190
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:19.501
Really?

191
00:24:20.241 --> 00:24:22.504
Mm-hmm. No idea
who it is. though.

192
00:24:22.678 --> 00:24:24.114
Probably my great-aunt Marion.

193
00:24:26.116 --> 00:24:27.117
Interesting.

194
00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:30.033
Oh. Thanks.

195
00:24:42.045 --> 00:24:43.046
So why are you here?

196
00:24:44.308 --> 00:24:45.832
What-- You invited me over.

197
00:24:46.006 --> 00:24:49.226
At the Lafayette. I mean.

198
00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.054
Oh.

199
00:24:51.228 --> 00:24:53.492
Uh. well. I--
I just found it online.

200
00:24:53.666 --> 00:24:56.277
I just needed something
that was cheap and furnished.

201
00:24:57.191 --> 00:25:00.934
The Lafayette collects
unusual people.

202
00:25:03.284 --> 00:25:04.851
What?So what about you?

203
00:25:05.634 --> 00:25:08.637
What makes you unusual?

204
00:25:09.551 --> 00:25:11.553
Wow. you're--
you're just--

205
00:25:11.727 --> 00:25:13.947
you're. like.
really direct. you know.

206
00:25:14.121 --> 00:25:15.339
It's. um...

207
00:25:16.297 --> 00:25:18.342
I mean. we just--
we just met.

208
00:25:18.517 --> 00:25:19.648
Right.

209
00:25:21.345 --> 00:25:24.523
I mean. I-I just
don't really like to talk
about it with anybody.

210
00:25:26.437 --> 00:25:27.917
Okay. well. it's--

211
00:25:28.091 --> 00:25:29.745
Uh. I have a--

212
00:25:29.919 --> 00:25:32.269
I just have this.
like. sleep thing.

213
00:25:32.443 --> 00:25:34.358
Sleep thing?
What kind of sleep thing?

214
00:25:34.533 --> 00:25:38.319
Insomnia. sleepwalking.
night terrors. apnea.

215
00:25:38.493 --> 00:25:39.712
restless leg syndrome?

216
00:25:39.886 --> 00:25:41.757
Oh. no. It's just--
It's a dream.

217
00:25:42.497 --> 00:25:43.629
A dream?

218
00:25:44.586 --> 00:25:46.240
It's a-- It's a recurring dream.

219
00:25:47.067 --> 00:25:48.938
I've had it
about 5.000 times in my life.

220
00:25:49.112 --> 00:25:52.072
That seems like a lot.Yeah.

221
00:25:52.246 --> 00:25:54.509
I mean. I think so.
That's actually--

222
00:25:54.683 --> 00:25:56.163
That's why
I'm in the city currently.

223
00:25:56.337 --> 00:25:58.687
I'm-- I'm seeing
this new therapist.

224
00:25:58.861 --> 00:26:03.518
He's supposed to be like
one of the top. uh. som--
somnambulists in the world.

225
00:26:03.692 --> 00:26:06.739
Somnambulist?

226
00:26:06.913 --> 00:26:08.828
Sleep doctor. Yeah.

227
00:26:09.959 --> 00:26:11.047
What's the dream?

228
00:26:11.657 --> 00:26:13.876
It's really weird.
Uh...

229
00:26:15.051 --> 00:26:17.706
Uh. it's this thing
where I am...

230
00:26:19.099 --> 00:26:22.015
I'm-- I'm in the house
where I grew up and then I--
It's just--

231
00:26:23.059 --> 00:26:24.887
I-I run to ask my dad something

232
00:26:25.061 --> 00:26:27.237
and then on my way to--
to ask him. there's an--

233
00:26:27.411 --> 00:26:28.717
I see this attic out
of the corner of my eye.

234
00:26:28.891 --> 00:26:30.284
but there was no attic
in the house.

235
00:26:30.458 --> 00:26:32.373
It's fucking weird.
It doesn't make any sense.

236
00:26:32.547 --> 00:26:34.331
Ah. like the house
on Ash Tree Lane.

237
00:26:35.855 --> 00:26:37.726
What?So this therapist.

238
00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:41.077
he's gonna help you understand
why you keep having the dream?

239
00:26:41.687 --> 00:26:44.385
Help you figure out what's
in your nonexistent attic?

240
00:26:44.559 --> 00:26:48.781
Maybe. I mean. it's--
He said that he's helped
people like me before. so...

241
00:26:50.652 --> 00:26:52.349
Well. I wonder
if I could help you.

242
00:26:52.523 --> 00:26:56.658
Oh. I mean.
I really appreciate that.
but it's actually--

243
00:26:57.877 --> 00:26:59.835
It's one of those things
I've-- I've just. um--

244
00:27:00.967 --> 00:27:03.926
I've been struggling with it
for a long time.

245
00:27:05.493 --> 00:27:06.712
I mean. it's kind of...

246
00:27:08.583 --> 00:27:10.672
affected my entire life.

247
00:27:11.804 --> 00:27:15.459
Would you say that
understanding your dream

248
00:27:15.634 --> 00:27:19.725
is the thing you want
more than anything else
in the entire world?

249
00:27:25.992 --> 00:27:26.993
Sure.

250
00:27:29.604 --> 00:27:33.869
Maybe. or just
not having it anymore.

251
00:27:34.653 --> 00:27:35.697
Have you tried acid?

252
00:27:35.871 --> 00:27:37.264
What? No. why?

253
00:27:37.438 --> 00:27:38.744
You think that will help?

254
00:27:52.453 --> 00:27:55.456
Oh. I don't really smoke.
but thanks.

255
00:27:58.459 --> 00:28:00.069
Uh. do you mind
if I use your restroom?

256
00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:03.594
Thanks.

257
00:28:30.099 --> 00:28:31.100
Okay.

258
00:29:31.334 --> 00:29:32.335
You're really pretty.

259
00:29:34.555 --> 00:29:35.861
Like an actress or something.

260
00:29:36.035 --> 00:29:37.819
I am an actress.What. really?

261
00:29:37.993 --> 00:29:39.038
Mm-hmm.

262
00:29:39.821 --> 00:29:41.867
Have you been in anything
I might have seen?

263
00:29:43.216 --> 00:29:44.217
No.

264
00:29:46.262 --> 00:29:47.176
Cool.

265
00:30:05.238 --> 00:30:06.326
It's getting late.

266
00:30:07.066 --> 00:30:08.937
Oh. yeah. No. you're right.
I should. uh...

267
00:30:09.111 --> 00:30:10.243
I should probably get going.

268
00:30:10.417 --> 00:30:12.288
I didn't say you needed to go.

269
00:30:12.462 --> 00:30:13.855
Just making an observation.

270
00:30:15.988 --> 00:30:18.251
Okay.Yeah. you probably should.

271
00:30:20.253 --> 00:30:21.254
Yeah.

272
00:30:24.431 --> 00:30:25.693
I had a dream once.

273
00:30:26.999 --> 00:30:31.873
I was in a house on a beach
and I was lying in bed.

274
00:30:34.267 --> 00:30:37.313
And I was so sure.

275
00:30:38.358 --> 00:30:40.751
absolutely. completely sure.

276
00:30:41.927 --> 00:30:44.973
that out on the sand
outside this house

277
00:30:46.192 --> 00:30:47.715
was a black horse.

278
00:30:51.893 --> 00:30:54.548
I was so positive
there was a horse out there.

279
00:30:54.722 --> 00:30:57.290
even though there was no reason
for there to be a horse.

280
00:30:58.247 --> 00:31:02.599
And so in the dream.
I just couldn't take it anymore.

281
00:31:02.773 --> 00:31:07.213
I got out of bed
and I marched to the window

282
00:31:07.387 --> 00:31:09.693
and I looked out on the sand.

283
00:31:12.566 --> 00:31:13.741
And there was a horse?

284
00:31:16.309 --> 00:31:17.310
Cool.

285
00:31:20.617 --> 00:31:23.316
You can come over
tomorrow night if you want.

286
00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:26.362
Maybe I can help you figure out
what's in your dream attic.

287
00:31:27.973 --> 00:31:29.017
Okay.Okay.

288
00:31:29.757 --> 00:31:31.585
Good night!

289
00:32:01.484 --> 00:32:03.573
Harrison. can you go
ask your dad

290
00:32:03.747 --> 00:32:06.446
if he remembered
to get garlic when he went
to the grocery store?

291
00:34:01.517 --> 00:34:04.390
Hey. hey. Wait. Wait!

292
00:34:13.964 --> 00:34:15.662
Okay. so--

293
00:34:15.836 --> 00:34:17.098
I have some serious questions

294
00:34:17.272 --> 00:34:18.926
about this apartment complex.

295
00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:20.667
I bet you do.

296
00:34:20.841 --> 00:34:23.104
Okay. first of all. room 408.

297
00:34:23.278 --> 00:34:25.367
There's this weird sound
coming out of that room.

298
00:34:25.541 --> 00:34:27.021
so I actually
got closer to the--

299
00:34:27.195 --> 00:34:30.068
I touched the door.

300
00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:36.204
Jesus.

301
00:34:36.378 --> 00:34:37.684
I can't talk about 408.

302
00:34:37.858 --> 00:34:40.687
Okay. well-- Really?

303
00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:44.647
I don't-- Okay. well.
this morning I was. um--

304
00:34:44.821 --> 00:34:47.259
I--
I was up on the roof. uh...

305
00:34:47.433 --> 00:34:49.261
There was this girl.

306
00:34:49.435 --> 00:34:51.480
Charmagne.Yeah. she was. um--

307
00:34:51.654 --> 00:34:52.829
Singing?

308
00:34:54.048 --> 00:34:56.877
Yeah. She was really good too.

309
00:34:57.051 --> 00:34:59.401
But what was with the mask?

310
00:34:59.575 --> 00:35:01.882
Charmagne has
the most beautiful face.

311
00:35:02.056 --> 00:35:05.407
So much so that anyone
who looks at it. man or woman.

312
00:35:06.278 --> 00:35:10.630
they just fall
head over heels
in love with her.

313
00:35:10.804 --> 00:35:12.980
And so she wears the mask.

314
00:35:13.807 --> 00:35:16.331
so that people
don't fall in love
with her all the time.

315
00:35:16.505 --> 00:35:19.073
Maybe that's probably
for the best then. you know?

316
00:35:19.247 --> 00:35:21.423
Yeah.

317
00:35:21.597 --> 00:35:22.598
Um...

318
00:35:24.252 --> 00:35:26.036
Okay. last but not least--

319
00:35:26.211 --> 00:35:27.212
Mm-hmm.Last night...

320
00:35:29.388 --> 00:35:33.696
there was a guy floating...
in the lobby.

321
00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:34.915
Elliot.

322
00:35:36.699 --> 00:35:38.614
Yeah. so. like. what's--
what's his story?

323
00:35:39.267 --> 00:35:40.486
He floats.

324
00:35:42.488 --> 00:35:44.054
I have to pee.

325
00:35:48.798 --> 00:35:50.974
He floats.

326
00:36:10.298 --> 00:36:12.431
Hey. you know. there's a--

327
00:36:12.605 --> 00:36:16.130
there's a book
in the middle of your floor.
Might want to move it.

328
00:36:16.304 --> 00:36:18.872
It's kind of a hazard.
don't you think?
Someone could trip on it.

329
00:36:19.046 --> 00:36:20.526
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.Huh?

330
00:36:22.397 --> 00:36:25.444
A very powerful wizard
used to live here before me.

331
00:36:26.662 --> 00:36:29.622
And when he left.
he left this book.

332
00:36:29.796 --> 00:36:30.753
And he told me

333
00:36:32.059 --> 00:36:34.714
if anyone were to read
even one line from it.

334
00:36:35.628 --> 00:36:37.282
they'd drop dead on the spot.

335
00:36:38.065 --> 00:36:41.242
And you
really believe that?

336
00:36:42.809 --> 00:36:43.810
Didn't you hear me?

337
00:36:45.159 --> 00:36:49.816
I said. a very powerful wizard.

338
00:36:52.035 --> 00:36:54.299
Uh. I don't know.

339
00:36:55.735 --> 00:36:59.129
I've heard you can have
kind of a crazy reaction to it.

340
00:36:59.304 --> 00:37:02.394
you know. like lose your mind
or something so...

341
00:37:02.568 --> 00:37:03.569
Open.

342
00:37:07.355 --> 00:37:08.356
Okay.

343
00:37:17.931 --> 00:37:19.019
Open.

344
00:37:21.891 --> 00:37:26.244
Harry. don't you know I'd never
let anything bad happen to you?

345
00:37:45.001 --> 00:37:48.788
Harrison. can you go
ask your dad

346
00:37:48.962 --> 00:37:51.791
if he remembered
to get garlic when he went
to the grocery store?

347
00:38:42.494 --> 00:38:43.669
I can just wait
for the next one.

348
00:38:43.843 --> 00:38:46.411
No. There is no next one.

349
00:38:51.677 --> 00:38:53.200
You spend the night
with Maria last night?

350
00:38:53.374 --> 00:38:54.897
How did you--

351
00:38:55.071 --> 00:38:58.118
Her smell is on you.
All over you.

352
00:39:00.773 --> 00:39:01.774
Hmm.

353
00:39:07.127 --> 00:39:08.171
Uh...

354
00:39:09.303 --> 00:39:10.348
So...

355
00:39:12.611 --> 00:39:15.091
But. um. yeah. it was-- it was
really good talking to you. man.

356
00:39:16.005 --> 00:39:19.313
Yeah. You too.So. I'll just
catch you later.

357
00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:22.055
Oh. you're-- Yeah. well--

358
00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:25.841
Okay.

359
00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:35.808
So. this is what the units
on this side of the building
look like.

360
00:39:37.157 --> 00:39:39.202
Uh. yeah. Yup.

361
00:39:41.857 --> 00:39:44.556
Sorry. I don't have
any beer or anything.

362
00:39:52.607 --> 00:39:53.608
Hey.

363
00:39:55.393 --> 00:39:56.916
I work
at the nature center downtown.

364
00:39:57.786 --> 00:39:59.397
You ever been?Uh...

365
00:39:59.571 --> 00:40:02.138
N-No.Caretaker there.

366
00:40:02.748 --> 00:40:06.360
I look after
the Arakan forest turtles.

367
00:40:06.534 --> 00:40:09.232
Oh. Sweet. Nice.

368
00:40:10.059 --> 00:40:11.060
Ever heard of 'em?

369
00:40:11.887 --> 00:40:14.324
Uh. no. I can't say
I have. actually.

370
00:40:14.499 --> 00:40:17.415
That's because they're one
of the most endangered species
on the planet.

371
00:40:17.589 --> 00:40:20.853
Oh. Well. then how many
do you guys have
at the nature center?

372
00:40:21.027 --> 00:40:22.637
Two.Oh.

373
00:40:22.811 --> 00:40:24.987
Guess how many are left
in the entire world.

374
00:40:26.467 --> 00:40:27.947
Um...

375
00:40:28.121 --> 00:40:29.209
Two.Oh.

376
00:40:30.471 --> 00:40:31.690
The last two.

377
00:40:31.864 --> 00:40:33.213
Wow. that's--

378
00:40:34.736 --> 00:40:37.043
That's really sad.
I mean. you know.
that they're almost ex--

379
00:40:37.217 --> 00:40:38.218
Don't say that.

380
00:40:38.958 --> 00:40:41.569
Come on. Be positive. man.

381
00:40:42.962 --> 00:40:44.964
Yeah. All right.

382
00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.445
But yeah.

383
00:40:49.316 --> 00:40:50.752
It's pretty goddamn sad.

384
00:40:51.927 --> 00:40:54.756
The two that we have
are male and female.

385
00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:57.498
the actual last
of their species.

386
00:40:59.282 --> 00:41:00.458
So as you can imagine.

387
00:41:01.981 --> 00:41:04.374
the most important
aspect of my job

388
00:41:04.549 --> 00:41:06.202
is trying to convince them
to breed.

389
00:41:09.728 --> 00:41:11.207
You know how stressful that is?

390
00:41:12.121 --> 00:41:14.210
I got a lot of problems
in my life. you know?

391
00:41:15.429 --> 00:41:20.042
Girls. money. health.

392
00:41:20.216 --> 00:41:23.393
It's easy to just leave my job
at work and forget about it.

393
00:41:24.656 --> 00:41:25.874
But then I think.

394
00:41:26.658 --> 00:41:28.355
"The continued existence

395
00:41:28.529 --> 00:41:31.532
of an animal that's been
living on this planet

396
00:41:31.706 --> 00:41:35.014
for tens of thousands of years

397
00:41:36.406 --> 00:41:38.278
is my sole responsibility.

398
00:41:40.585 --> 00:41:42.978
What are my problems
compared to that?"

399
00:41:47.156 --> 00:41:49.507
I have to get
those two turtles to fuck.

400
00:41:51.334 --> 00:41:53.249
It's the most important thing
in the world.

401
00:41:56.209 --> 00:41:57.384
Do they not want to?

402
00:42:00.082 --> 00:42:01.606
How the hell
am I supposed to know?

403
00:42:02.781 --> 00:42:05.523
I can't exactly ask them.
They're turtles.

404
00:42:05.697 --> 00:42:08.700
Right. I'm just wondering
if they seem. um--

405
00:42:09.962 --> 00:42:11.180
interested in each other.

406
00:42:14.793 --> 00:42:15.837
I do everything I can

407
00:42:16.011 --> 00:42:17.491
to make their surroundings

408
00:42:17.665 --> 00:42:18.840
as comfortable as possible.

409
00:42:19.928 --> 00:42:24.019
I put a little bed
in their tank. you know?

410
00:42:25.891 --> 00:42:27.196
I put leaves on it.

411
00:42:30.069 --> 00:42:32.593
I tried playing
sexy music for 'em. even.

412
00:42:43.822 --> 00:42:45.388
Does any of that work?

413
00:42:47.869 --> 00:42:48.870
Hasn't yet.

414
00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:52.091
Shit.

415
00:42:53.962 --> 00:42:55.921
I really hope
that works out.

416
00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.142
You hope that it works out?

417
00:43:02.014 --> 00:43:03.319
Yeah.

418
00:43:03.493 --> 00:43:06.235
You hope that this species

419
00:43:06.409 --> 00:43:08.063
continues to exist
on this planet?

420
00:43:09.151 --> 00:43:10.326
How kind of you.

421
00:43:14.026 --> 00:43:15.810
Next time things
are going bad for you.

422
00:43:17.116 --> 00:43:20.685
and you have some big problem
that's so important...

423
00:43:25.472 --> 00:43:26.952
remember those turtles.

424
00:43:30.433 --> 00:43:31.478
Okay.

425
00:43:38.311 --> 00:43:39.617
The dream changed.

426
00:43:39.791 --> 00:43:41.096
Just--

427
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:42.402
Just a tiny. tiny bit.

428
00:43:42.576 --> 00:43:43.925
I. uh-- I--

429
00:43:45.492 --> 00:43:47.581
I glanced up at the string.

430
00:43:49.322 --> 00:43:51.541
Directly at it. And that was it.

431
00:43:52.281 --> 00:43:55.720
And this was
right after your evening with--

432
00:43:55.894 --> 00:43:57.591
What was her name?Maria.

433
00:43:59.375 --> 00:44:01.595
I see.What do you think happened?

434
00:44:02.465 --> 00:44:06.905
I don't... know for certain.

435
00:44:07.079 --> 00:44:08.994
Your condition is very rare.

436
00:44:09.168 --> 00:44:10.778
Condition? What?

437
00:44:12.171 --> 00:44:18.307
Well. you're experiencing
the... dream symptom.

438
00:44:20.788 --> 00:44:21.920
Very...

439
00:44:23.791 --> 00:44:25.140
serious...

440
00:44:27.665 --> 00:44:28.970
illness.

441
00:44:29.144 --> 00:44:30.189
It is?

442
00:44:30.363 --> 00:44:32.104
Yes. And it...

443
00:44:38.545 --> 00:44:41.287
I'm surprised
it didn't occur to me earlier.

444
00:44:42.941 --> 00:44:43.942
What?

445
00:44:44.594 --> 00:44:46.205
Your whore friend Maria.

446
00:44:46.379 --> 00:44:48.555
What? What?

447
00:44:50.426 --> 00:44:52.428
What did you say?
What did you just say?

448
00:44:52.602 --> 00:44:53.691
What-- What's wrong?

449
00:44:53.865 --> 00:44:55.170
It sounded like you--

450
00:44:55.344 --> 00:44:57.259
Did you just call Maria a whore?

451
00:44:57.433 --> 00:45:00.132
No. of course not. Why on earth
would I have done that?

452
00:45:00.306 --> 00:45:03.526
I said. "Your friend Maria."

453
00:45:08.793 --> 00:45:10.142
What about her?

454
00:45:14.886 --> 00:45:15.887
Nothing.

455
00:45:18.019 --> 00:45:19.064
Nothing.

456
00:45:19.238 --> 00:45:21.980
It's just curious that...

457
00:45:25.418 --> 00:45:26.941
that you would meet her now.

458
00:45:28.813 --> 00:45:30.423
The timing of it all.

459
00:45:32.947 --> 00:45:35.776
No matter. I think
that on your next visit.

460
00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:39.998
we should start the treatment.

461
00:45:40.172 --> 00:45:41.303
I think you're ready.

462
00:45:43.175 --> 00:45:44.437
The hypnosis?

463
00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:49.747
Okay. Um...

464
00:45:50.443 --> 00:45:52.924
You said you wanted
to understand the dream better

465
00:45:53.098 --> 00:45:54.099
before we did that.

466
00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:56.971
I think I do now.

467
00:46:05.763 --> 00:46:06.764
One sec.

468
00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:09.114
Coming!

469
00:46:11.029 --> 00:46:12.508
Coming. coming. coming. coming.

470
00:46:15.337 --> 00:46:17.165
Hey!Aw!

471
00:46:17.992 --> 00:46:20.995
Cute place.Thanks. Uh. I haven't
really had a chance--

472
00:46:21.169 --> 00:46:23.650
Have I told you
about my friends
Lauren and Oliver?

473
00:46:23.824 --> 00:46:25.478
They live in 201.Uh...

474
00:46:25.652 --> 00:46:27.001
No. I don't think so.Lauren's my best friend

475
00:46:27.175 --> 00:46:28.568
and Oliver. well...

476
00:46:28.742 --> 00:46:30.526
Oliver's a fucking prick.Yeah.

477
00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:33.138
You'll meet them soon.
Lauren works for Rory Calhoun.

478
00:46:33.312 --> 00:46:36.184
You obviously know
who that is.No. I don't. actually.

479
00:46:36.358 --> 00:46:38.970
Oliver just loves the theater.
I mean. you wouldn't expect it.

480
00:46:39.144 --> 00:46:41.755
So last month
they came to see me
at the center in Ruston.

481
00:46:41.929 --> 00:46:43.148
It was Cymbeline...

482
00:46:44.932 --> 00:46:46.238
but with lesbians.

483
00:46:47.195 --> 00:46:50.329
Which.
now that I think about it.
is kind of ironic.

484
00:46:50.503 --> 00:46:53.767
Anyway. they brought Rory.
and I guess

485
00:46:53.941 --> 00:46:56.857
Rory liked my performance
and was super impressed with me.

486
00:46:57.031 --> 00:46:59.555
So he wanted me to send him
something of me on tape.

487
00:46:59.729 --> 00:47:02.297
because he thinks
I might be right
for a role in his upcoming film.

488
00:47:02.471 --> 00:47:05.083
I mean.
can you believe that?Oh. wow.

489
00:47:05.257 --> 00:47:06.736
That's amazing.He's interested.

490
00:47:06.911 --> 00:47:08.173
That's so cool.In me.

491
00:47:08.347 --> 00:47:10.566
I'm sorry.
but I don't know
who he is.

492
00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:14.222
This is the most important thing

493
00:47:14.396 --> 00:47:17.225
that has ever happened to me
in my entire life.

494
00:47:20.228 --> 00:47:21.621
Do you want me
to help make the video?

495
00:47:21.795 --> 00:47:23.753
Yes. I want you to help operate.

496
00:47:23.928 --> 00:47:24.972
Okay.

497
00:47:25.712 --> 00:47:27.322
Okay. I don't really know
how to do this.

498
00:47:27.496 --> 00:47:30.891
Yeah. you press record.
and then you press stop.

499
00:47:31.065 --> 00:47:34.503
And. uh. say "action."

500
00:47:34.677 --> 00:47:36.766
Okay.Okay. Okay.

501
00:47:36.941 --> 00:47:38.420
Wait.

502
00:47:40.814 --> 00:47:44.731
One second.How's it look?

503
00:47:44.905 --> 00:47:46.341
Yeah. it look-- it looks great.

504
00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:49.431
Are you ready?

505
00:47:56.308 --> 00:47:57.526
And action!

506
00:48:06.187 --> 00:48:08.059
I was continuing to shrink.

507
00:48:12.672 --> 00:48:15.980
To become... what?

508
00:48:17.372 --> 00:48:18.808
The infinitesimal?

509
00:48:21.333 --> 00:48:22.464
What was I?

510
00:48:26.381 --> 00:48:27.905
Still a human being.

511
00:48:30.429 --> 00:48:32.474
Or was I a man of the future?

512
00:48:33.649 --> 00:48:35.086
In that moment. I knew

513
00:48:36.652 --> 00:48:40.874
the answer to the riddle
of the infinite.

514
00:48:41.875 --> 00:48:43.311
You see. I had thought

515
00:48:43.485 --> 00:48:46.184
in terms of man's own
limited dimension.

516
00:48:46.358 --> 00:48:49.796
I had presumed
upon nature.

517
00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:51.929
That existence begins and ends

518
00:48:52.103 --> 00:48:55.933
is man's conception.
not nature's.

519
00:48:58.457 --> 00:49:00.415
And I felt my body dwindling.

520
00:49:02.983 --> 00:49:03.984
Melting.

521
00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.901
Becoming nothing.

522
00:49:10.469 --> 00:49:12.384
My fears melted away.

523
00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:15.865
And in their place
came acceptance.

524
00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:21.523
All this vast majesty
of creation.

525
00:49:22.916 --> 00:49:25.092
Surely. it had
to mean something.

526
00:49:26.746 --> 00:49:28.443
And then I meant something too.

527
00:49:29.444 --> 00:49:34.580
Yes. Smaller than the small.
I meant something too.

528
00:49:47.114 --> 00:49:48.159
Say "cut."

529
00:49:48.811 --> 00:49:49.769
Oh. cut.

530
00:49:49.943 --> 00:49:53.512
Hmm. Oh. How was that?

531
00:49:56.732 --> 00:49:58.517
I don't know what to say.

532
00:49:58.691 --> 00:50:01.694
No-- I think it was perfect.

533
00:50:02.521 --> 00:50:04.001
Really?Yeah.

534
00:50:04.175 --> 00:50:06.829
Okay. well. if I need
to do another take.

535
00:50:07.004 --> 00:50:09.484
I know where
to find you. I'll be here.

536
00:50:09.658 --> 00:50:12.009
Now I have to go get ready
for my party tonight.

537
00:50:12.183 --> 00:50:15.055
Oh. my God. I didn't tell you
I'm having a party tonight. huh?

538
00:50:15.229 --> 00:50:16.752
Um. no. I don't think so.

539
00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:21.279
Would you like to come
to my party tonight?
I would be honored.

540
00:50:22.019 --> 00:50:23.585
Yeah. sure.Ah! Great.

541
00:50:23.759 --> 00:50:25.196
What time?We're gonna have so much fun.

542
00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:27.415
Now that I have this done.
I feel better.

543
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:28.764
What time?

544
00:50:34.379 --> 00:50:37.295
Oh! Maria. you--
you left your shoes.

545
00:51:06.976 --> 00:51:09.370
Simone. darling.

546
00:51:10.328 --> 00:51:11.242
Hi.Hey.

547
00:51:11.416 --> 00:51:12.417
Thank you for coming.

548
00:51:12.591 --> 00:51:13.766
Yeah. this is great.Oh!

549
00:51:14.941 --> 00:51:17.552
Have you gotten a drink yet?Uh. no. not yet.

550
00:51:17.726 --> 00:51:19.293
Remember I told you
about Lauren and Oliver?

551
00:51:19.467 --> 00:51:21.252
Yeah.They're here.
Do you want to meet them?

552
00:51:21.426 --> 00:51:22.688
Sure.Come on.

553
00:51:24.690 --> 00:51:25.908
She told me
she was gonna be here.

554
00:51:26.083 --> 00:51:27.606
Lauren?

555
00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:29.521
Hello. gorgeous.Hi.

556
00:51:31.392 --> 00:51:33.351
Will Oliver be joining us?

557
00:51:33.525 --> 00:51:36.005
Yeah. 20 minutes
or so. I reckon.Oh. soon.

558
00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:38.660
Yeah.
I hear him whispering already.

559
00:51:40.401 --> 00:51:42.099
This is Harrison Hardy.

560
00:51:42.273 --> 00:51:44.753
The new tenant in 429.Mm-hmm.

561
00:51:44.927 --> 00:51:46.581
The one with the sleep thing.

562
00:51:47.713 --> 00:51:49.976
And this is Lauren Reitz.

563
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:51.499
And this is Oliver Black.

564
00:51:51.673 --> 00:51:53.414
It is so nice
to meet you. Harrison.

565
00:51:53.588 --> 00:51:55.416
Maria's told me
such great things.

566
00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:59.203
Uh. I'm sorry.
Lauren Reitz and. uh...

567
00:51:59.377 --> 00:52:00.465
What was it?

568
00:52:00.639 --> 00:52:02.423
Oliver.Oliver.

569
00:52:04.338 --> 00:52:07.385
Lauren shares her body
with a 55-year-old British man
named Oliver Black.

570
00:52:07.559 --> 00:52:09.735
Fifty-six.
His birthday was last week.

571
00:52:09.909 --> 00:52:12.520
A Gemini?Yeah.

572
00:52:12.694 --> 00:52:15.828
Well. then it's very nice
to meet the two of you. I guess.

573
00:52:16.002 --> 00:52:18.047
I'm gonna get you a drink.
What do you want? A cocktail?

574
00:52:18.222 --> 00:52:20.659
Um-- Just a beer is fine.

575
00:52:20.833 --> 00:52:22.530
Sure.Thank you.

576
00:52:23.531 --> 00:52:24.837
Just a bit of advice.

577
00:52:25.011 --> 00:52:26.839
I wouldn't let them
get your drink.

578
00:52:27.013 --> 00:52:30.408
Lauren is trustworthy.
but Oliver will roofie you.

579
00:52:31.757 --> 00:52:34.934
And I'd be careful what I say
about one to the other.

580
00:52:35.108 --> 00:52:37.328
Because I'm not entirely sure
what they can and can't hear.

581
00:52:37.502 --> 00:52:39.634
If you know what I mean.I...

582
00:52:40.331 --> 00:52:41.636
Isn't she cute?

583
00:52:42.985 --> 00:52:45.118
Here you go.Thank you.

584
00:52:46.902 --> 00:52:49.601
So. welcome to Lafayette.

585
00:52:49.775 --> 00:52:50.689
Settling in?

586
00:52:50.863 --> 00:52:52.691
Um-- Kind of. yeah.

587
00:52:52.865 --> 00:52:55.955
Tell me about this dream thing.
Sounds interesting.

588
00:52:56.129 --> 00:52:59.306
You know. I'd really rather not.
It's-- It's pretty embarrassing.

589
00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:02.396
Come on. We're all
a little embarrassing here.

590
00:53:04.006 --> 00:53:05.791
Yeah. she's always trying
to set me up with guys.

591
00:53:05.965 --> 00:53:09.751
I appreciate it. you know.
but tell her she's got to stop.

592
00:53:09.925 --> 00:53:13.929
And I know she means well.
but I'm a fucking lot to handle.

593
00:53:14.103 --> 00:53:16.367
Oh. no. You seem great.

594
00:53:17.455 --> 00:53:19.631
That's really sweet
of you to say.

595
00:53:19.805 --> 00:53:22.503
But you haven't met him.

596
00:53:24.026 --> 00:53:28.596
Tell me. though. if I wasn't
possessed by an old British man.

597
00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:29.989
would you be attracted to me?

598
00:53:30.555 --> 00:53:33.384
I-- You're very pretty.

599
00:53:35.081 --> 00:53:37.431
I try to look
on the bright side. you know?

600
00:53:37.605 --> 00:53:39.781
At least I only have
one interloper.

601
00:53:39.955 --> 00:53:41.914
I mean. I could be
like Truddi Chase.

602
00:53:45.265 --> 00:53:47.746
He is the interloper.
though. right?

603
00:53:48.312 --> 00:53:51.097
What does this body
look like to you?

604
00:53:51.271 --> 00:53:54.100
Uh. what? Uh. it--

605
00:53:54.274 --> 00:53:55.928
You look like a young woman.

606
00:53:56.102 --> 00:53:58.060
A beautiful young woman?

607
00:53:58.235 --> 00:54:00.106
Um. I'd say so. yes.

608
00:54:02.282 --> 00:54:03.718
There you go.

609
00:54:06.243 --> 00:54:11.335
He does like
to watch me have sex.

610
00:54:12.074 --> 00:54:13.772
It makes it
really hard to focus.

611
00:54:14.425 --> 00:54:18.124
Uh. hmm. Hmm.

612
00:54:18.298 --> 00:54:22.607
I'm gonna go get another.
You want one?I'm good here. Thank you.

613
00:54:35.533 --> 00:54:36.621
Pardon me.

614
00:54:38.492 --> 00:54:41.321
Have you seen my sister?
I can't seem
to find her anywhere.

615
00:54:43.192 --> 00:54:45.717
Hmm. No. I'm--
I'm sorry. I can't.

616
00:54:45.891 --> 00:54:47.327
I don't know
where your sister is.

617
00:55:01.689 --> 00:55:03.778
Look at this.Hey!

618
00:55:06.128 --> 00:55:07.782
Oh. fuck.

619
00:55:10.916 --> 00:55:14.223
You smoking inside?Fuck is it to you?

620
00:55:15.355 --> 00:55:20.404
Oh! If it ain't the prick
who's scheming to get
into little Lauren's knickers.

621
00:55:22.188 --> 00:55:24.669
Let me save you
the fucking sweet talk.

622
00:55:25.887 --> 00:55:28.150
A slam dunk. Come on.
Take a sniff. sniff. sniff.

623
00:55:28.325 --> 00:55:29.630
Stop. don't do that.
Don't. Come on.

624
00:55:29.804 --> 00:55:32.546
Wow. you must be Oliver.

625
00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:34.287
And you must be
"who gives a fuck?"

626
00:55:35.244 --> 00:55:37.116
Okay. so when--
when you're here.

627
00:55:37.290 --> 00:55:39.336
Lauren is
completely unavailable?

628
00:55:43.383 --> 00:55:45.690
What do you care?

629
00:55:46.343 --> 00:55:49.433
I-- I just enjoy
talking to her.
She seems nice.

630
00:55:49.607 --> 00:55:51.783
She's a cunt just like you.Okay.

631
00:55:51.957 --> 00:55:53.698
Well. she seems nice.

632
00:55:53.872 --> 00:55:55.874
Oh. yeah. you'd know
better than me. wouldn't you?

633
00:55:56.048 --> 00:55:57.615
What. you've known her
30 minutes?

634
00:55:57.789 --> 00:56:00.226
And I've lived
inside her for 30 years.

635
00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:02.141
Oh. you've been
inside her that long?

636
00:56:04.752 --> 00:56:07.668
Got another fag. fag?

637
00:56:09.757 --> 00:56:11.846
It must be really hard.Yeah. of course it's hard.

638
00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:14.980
What. you think
I like giving blow jobs
and being buggered?

639
00:56:15.154 --> 00:56:17.286
What. I look
like a fucking homo to you?

640
00:56:17.939 --> 00:56:21.116
What I want to do
is shove my cock

641
00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:24.076
up her friend Maria's arse
and make her scream.Okay.

642
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:28.080
But guess what?
I ain't got no cock.

643
00:56:28.254 --> 00:56:31.083
What about you?
You aren't horny?Stop! Come on. knock it off.

644
00:56:31.257 --> 00:56:32.954
Jesus.

645
00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:38.177
Where have I seen you before?

646
00:56:38.351 --> 00:56:40.048
You say you've never been
to Sussex?

647
00:56:40.222 --> 00:56:41.920
No. Can't say I have.

648
00:56:42.094 --> 00:56:44.879
Oh. that's right.
It was a photograph.

649
00:56:45.053 --> 00:56:48.230
I'll never forget a face
as ugly as yours.

650
00:56:48.405 --> 00:56:50.276
If Lauren finds you attractive.

651
00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:51.625
she's even dumber
than I thought.

652
00:56:51.799 --> 00:56:53.279
Wait. did you say photograph?

653
00:56:55.324 --> 00:56:58.371
Yeah. Mutual acquaintance
showed it to me.

654
00:56:59.807 --> 00:57:02.070
Who?I ain't saying.

655
00:57:03.768 --> 00:57:05.987
She might be listening.

656
00:57:34.059 --> 00:57:36.888
Maria. Hey.

657
00:57:44.330 --> 00:57:45.462
Leave me alone.

658
00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:53.731
It's you.

659
00:57:54.645 --> 00:57:55.950
I'm sorry

660
00:57:57.474 --> 00:57:59.606
you didn't find me sooner.

661
00:58:12.445 --> 00:58:14.926
Mmm. So. how are the turtles?

662
00:58:16.797 --> 00:58:17.885
Still virgins.

663
00:58:18.799 --> 00:58:19.887
Fuck.

664
00:58:20.758 --> 00:58:22.542
That sucks. man.

665
00:58:22.716 --> 00:58:23.848
It does.

666
00:58:29.288 --> 00:58:31.116
You know what's
total fucking bullshit?

667
00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:33.901
What's that?

668
00:58:34.815 --> 00:58:35.816
Everything.

669
00:58:40.255 --> 00:58:43.171
I'm serious.
Like. what the fuck
are we doing here?

670
00:58:43.345 --> 00:58:46.784
You know.
we're on this planet.
what. 80 years?

671
00:58:47.611 --> 00:58:49.395
And that's it?
Like. what is that?

672
00:58:51.092 --> 00:58:52.746
It's fucking nothing.
I mean.

673
00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:54.922
in the grand scheme
of the whole universe.

674
00:58:55.096 --> 00:58:56.097
you know what that is?

675
00:58:57.925 --> 00:59:00.754
That is a goddamn
fart in the wind.

676
00:59:02.843 --> 00:59:05.280
You know what?
Actually. it's not
even a fart. We're--

677
00:59:05.454 --> 00:59:07.500
It-- It's
a shadow of a fart.

678
00:59:07.674 --> 00:59:11.548
You and I are shadows
of a fucking fart
in the wind.

679
00:59:13.637 --> 00:59:15.377
It's not enough time. you know?

680
00:59:16.683 --> 00:59:18.032
I don't wanna die.

681
00:59:20.121 --> 00:59:23.429
I wanna live forever.
I mean. I like myself. David.

682
00:59:23.603 --> 00:59:26.084
I don't wanna know myself
for just a shadow-fart span.

683
00:59:26.258 --> 00:59:27.651
It's not enough. you know?

684
00:59:33.657 --> 00:59:37.138
I like me.
I like who I am.

685
00:59:39.227 --> 00:59:40.446
I don't wanna die.

686
00:59:44.668 --> 00:59:46.060
Just everything...

687
00:59:47.758 --> 00:59:49.934
everything we are...

688
00:59:52.893 --> 00:59:54.547
everything we own...

689
00:59:56.593 --> 01:00:00.118
these-- these bodies.
our memories...

690
01:00:02.337 --> 01:00:05.776
everyone we know.
all goes away in the end.

691
01:00:07.865 --> 01:00:09.693
And we're just--What?

692
01:00:11.564 --> 01:00:13.610
Yeah. exactly.Man...

693
01:00:15.524 --> 01:00:18.136
you got some dark thoughts
inside that head.

694
01:00:19.659 --> 01:00:20.660
Yeah.

695
01:00:30.278 --> 01:00:31.453
Excuse me. Rory.

696
01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:33.586
There's some people here
to see you.

697
01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:37.111
Who are they?

698
01:00:37.285 --> 01:00:39.374
I thought I had no meetings
this afternoon.

699
01:00:39.548 --> 01:00:41.725
You know I've been working
on that counteroffer.

700
01:00:41.899 --> 01:00:43.944
'm sorry.
They're on their way.Wow. what?

701
01:00:44.118 --> 01:00:45.946
Hey. no.

702
01:00:52.213 --> 01:00:53.214
Shit.

703
01:01:05.618 --> 01:01:06.967
Hello. Rory.

704
01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:17.804
The arrangements we made
previously seem suitable.

705
01:01:20.415 --> 01:01:21.460
Mm-hmm.

706
01:01:24.028 --> 01:01:27.466
I require your assistance
in a new matter.

707
01:01:28.946 --> 01:01:33.951
Nothing too strenuous.
I assure you.

708
01:01:38.042 --> 01:01:39.086
You promised me.

709
01:01:45.353 --> 01:01:47.834
I'm sorry. you were saying?

710
01:01:50.794 --> 01:01:51.795
Nothing.

711
01:01:52.621 --> 01:01:53.666
Right.

712
01:01:55.276 --> 01:01:57.583
I require your assistance
in a new matter.

713
01:01:57.757 --> 01:02:00.499
Nothing too strenuous.
I assure you.

714
01:02:00.673 --> 01:02:03.241
Just a simple procurement.

715
01:02:03.415 --> 01:02:06.157
Your involvement
will be minimal.

716
01:02:09.247 --> 01:02:10.248
Listen...

717
01:02:12.206 --> 01:02:15.601
I know what our arrangement is.

718
01:02:15.775 --> 01:02:18.256
But you told me
I fulfilled my obligation.

719
01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:23.652
You had. but this
current development
was... unexpected.

720
01:02:29.615 --> 01:02:33.053
I still have fucking nightmares
about the last time.

721
01:02:33.227 --> 01:02:34.228
I know.

722
01:02:38.232 --> 01:02:40.191
So you can't just-- just. uh...

723
01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:43.629
come in here
and ask me to help you.

724
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:46.284
Again. I'm...

725
01:02:47.894 --> 01:02:49.461
I'm really busy. I'm busy.

726
01:02:49.635 --> 01:02:51.985
And I-I have been working
on this counteroffer.

727
01:02:52.159 --> 01:02:56.598
I understand.
I do. however.
have one question.

728
01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:04.781
Where am I?

729
01:03:07.958 --> 01:03:09.307
Who the fuck are you?

730
01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:13.006
Tell me. Rory...

731
01:03:15.748 --> 01:03:18.664
do you enjoy existing?

732
01:04:20.639 --> 01:04:22.641
Hey.

733
01:04:22.815 --> 01:04:23.947
Hey!

734
01:04:24.121 --> 01:04:25.687
You look amazing.

735
01:04:26.819 --> 01:04:29.343
Really? I'm so nervous.

736
01:04:29.517 --> 01:04:31.911
Don't be. Rory's a sweetheart.
You're gonna love him.

737
01:04:32.085 --> 01:04:33.130
I hope he likes me.

738
01:04:33.304 --> 01:04:34.522
Come on.Okay.

739
01:05:04.944 --> 01:05:05.945
Yeah.

740
01:05:07.512 --> 01:05:11.472
Get me someone. Anyone.

741
01:05:13.170 --> 01:05:14.171
Hey. Maria.

742
01:06:22.587 --> 01:06:24.502
Come on.

743
01:07:32.091 --> 01:07:33.310
Help me.

744
01:07:36.965 --> 01:07:38.097
Hello?

745
01:07:40.621 --> 01:07:42.058
Help me. Help me.

746
01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:45.452
Hello?

747
01:07:46.845 --> 01:07:47.889
Help me.

748
01:07:58.639 --> 01:08:01.294
Help me. help me.
help me. help me...

749
01:08:08.214 --> 01:08:11.217
Help me. help me.
help me. help me...

750
01:08:32.717 --> 01:08:34.719
Hello?
Help me.

751
01:08:38.375 --> 01:08:39.680
Hel-- Help me.

752
01:08:39.854 --> 01:08:40.899
Hello?

753
01:08:54.304 --> 01:08:56.175
911. what's your emergency? Hi. um--

754
01:08:56.349 --> 01:08:58.046
actually I don't know
if it's an emergency.

755
01:08:58.221 --> 01:08:59.657
but I just got a call
from a friend

756
01:08:59.831 --> 01:09:01.833
and I think she might be
in some kind of danger.

757
01:09:02.007 --> 01:09:04.357
Please hold. Oh-- Yeah. Okay.

758
01:09:09.971 --> 01:09:11.059
Help me.

759
01:09:13.714 --> 01:09:16.500
H-Hello? Harry. help me.

760
01:09:17.936 --> 01:09:18.980
Hello?

761
01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:43.266
Rory Calhoun's office.

762
01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:44.832
How can I help you? Shit.

763
01:09:48.836 --> 01:09:51.361
Rory Calhoun.

764
01:09:55.408 --> 01:09:56.540
Oh. my God.

765
01:10:02.415 --> 01:10:04.374
Okay. okay. okay...

766
01:10:04.548 --> 01:10:06.071
Rory Calhoun's office.

767
01:10:08.943 --> 01:10:11.207
Hello? Yeah. Hello.

768
01:10:11.381 --> 01:10:12.512
How can I help you?

769
01:10:13.948 --> 01:10:17.778
Um. I actually got
a strange call from this number.

770
01:10:19.476 --> 01:10:20.738
Who am I speaking with?

771
01:10:22.696 --> 01:10:24.176
Who am I speaking with?

772
01:10:25.003 --> 01:10:26.918
Please hold. No. wait. wait. wait.

773
01:10:30.965 --> 01:10:32.967
Sorry for the wait.
I've got Mr. Calhoun
for you now.

774
01:10:33.141 --> 01:10:36.014
Wait. what? No. no. no.
No. Please don't.

775
01:10:39.147 --> 01:10:40.627
Help me.

776
01:10:45.676 --> 01:10:46.677
Maria?

777
01:10:47.634 --> 01:10:49.680
Harry. help me.

778
01:10:50.898 --> 01:10:52.509
Maria. is-- is that you?

779
01:10:54.728 --> 01:10:55.729
Hello?

780
01:10:58.645 --> 01:11:02.170
Hello. Harrison.
Good to see you.Hi. Um...

781
01:11:02.345 --> 01:11:04.521
Something really strange
is going on.
I don't know. uh...

782
01:11:04.695 --> 01:11:07.393
Something like--
Maria might be
in some sort of trouble.

783
01:11:07.567 --> 01:11:08.612
How so?

784
01:11:09.482 --> 01:11:11.571
I don't-- I don't know.
Never mind. It's--

785
01:11:11.745 --> 01:11:14.095
We're supposed to do the--
the hypnosis today?

786
01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:15.967
We are.Okay.

787
01:11:16.141 --> 01:11:17.621
Well. I should tell you then.

788
01:11:17.795 --> 01:11:21.277
the dream.
it continued to expand.

789
01:11:22.016 --> 01:11:26.020
This time I-I--
I pulled down the string.

790
01:11:26.934 --> 01:11:29.807
I climbed up the ladder
and I actually peeked
into the attic.

791
01:11:31.156 --> 01:11:35.203
I-I... see. and wh--

792
01:11:39.077 --> 01:11:41.514
What was in there?Photographs.

793
01:11:42.123 --> 01:11:46.302
Boxes of them. like these--
you know. those old-style
Polaroid photos?

794
01:11:47.085 --> 01:11:48.391
There were just stacks of them.

795
01:11:49.566 --> 01:11:52.482
And did you look at any of them?

796
01:11:54.092 --> 01:11:57.356
Yeah. Uh. there-- there were
pictures of people. uh...

797
01:11:57.530 --> 01:12:00.751
Some...
Some of them I recognized.

798
01:12:02.013 --> 01:12:03.362
but mostly strangers.

799
01:12:04.145 --> 01:12:05.190
I see.

800
01:12:05.973 --> 01:12:08.976
Well. I think we should begin
with this treatment.

801
01:12:09.150 --> 01:12:10.151
Are you ready?

802
01:12:10.761 --> 01:12:12.240
Sure.Close your eyes.

803
01:12:13.851 --> 01:12:17.202
What I am going to do now
is give you a riddle.

804
01:12:17.376 --> 01:12:21.772
It will only take a moment
and when I'm finished.

805
01:12:21.946 --> 01:12:25.341
you will undergo a change.

806
01:12:27.081 --> 01:12:29.736
But you must pay
very close attention

807
01:12:30.607 --> 01:12:34.132
and do not interrupt me
once I start.

808
01:12:35.481 --> 01:12:37.483
Do you understand?

809
01:12:39.659 --> 01:12:41.705
Yes. but. uh. before we start.

810
01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:45.273
what did you mean the other day

811
01:12:46.274 --> 01:12:48.755
when you said it was curious
that I met her now?

812
01:12:50.496 --> 01:12:52.498
I'm not sure I understand.

813
01:12:52.672 --> 01:12:54.631
You said it was curious
that I met Maria now.

814
01:12:55.458 --> 01:12:56.633
The timing of it all.

815
01:12:58.156 --> 01:13:02.203
Let's discuss that further
after we've begun the hypnosis.

816
01:13:03.204 --> 01:13:04.249
Okay.

817
01:13:08.688 --> 01:13:10.429
And you definitely
didn't call her a whore?

818
01:13:10.603 --> 01:13:12.605
I definitely did not.

819
01:13:13.345 --> 01:13:15.565
She's quite pleasant. I'm sure.

820
01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:20.961
Okay.

821
01:13:24.312 --> 01:13:25.966
Three brothers are traveling

822
01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:27.881
and stop at an inn one night

823
01:13:28.752 --> 01:13:30.188
and ask for a room.

824
01:13:32.712 --> 01:13:34.671
The cost of the room is--

825
01:13:36.499 --> 01:13:38.892
Is--That scared
the fuck out of me.

826
01:13:39.066 --> 01:13:41.329
I am so sorry.

827
01:13:41.504 --> 01:13:44.811
It's fine.I swore I turned
that fucking ringer off.

828
01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:55.822
I have no idea what that was.

829
01:13:55.996 --> 01:13:56.997
Let's begin.

830
01:14:04.614 --> 01:14:08.139
Three brothers are traveling
and stop at an inn one night.

831
01:14:08.313 --> 01:14:10.141
and ask for a room.

832
01:14:12.099 --> 01:14:16.364
The cost of the room
is 30 gold pieces.

833
01:14:16.539 --> 01:14:20.020
Each brother pays
ten gold pieces.

834
01:14:24.329 --> 01:14:25.461
I thought you said
you turned it off.

835
01:14:26.636 --> 01:14:29.029
I did.

836
01:14:33.164 --> 01:14:35.775
I did. Clearly. it's--

837
01:14:35.949 --> 01:14:37.560
It must be
malfunctioning.

838
01:14:37.734 --> 01:14:40.084
I'll have Cindy
buy a new one.Answer it.

839
01:14:42.042 --> 01:14:44.044
Excuse me?Pick it up.

840
01:14:44.218 --> 01:14:46.917
It-- It's unplugged.

841
01:14:47.091 --> 01:14:48.396
Clearly. it's broken.

842
01:14:48.571 --> 01:14:49.615
Answer it.

843
01:14:51.312 --> 01:14:53.880
Answer it. please.

844
01:14:55.534 --> 01:14:56.579
No.

845
01:14:57.971 --> 01:15:00.670
Answer it or we won't be able
to continue with your riddle.

846
01:15:00.844 --> 01:15:02.976
I'll just...

847
01:15:03.150 --> 01:15:04.195
...put it outside.

848
01:15:06.937 --> 01:15:08.634
Help me.

849
01:15:10.114 --> 01:15:11.507
Harrison. wait!

850
01:15:19.863 --> 01:15:20.864
Maria?

851
01:15:24.041 --> 01:15:25.042
Maria!

852
01:16:20.271 --> 01:16:23.317
Lauren. hey. Uh. I was actually
gonna come and try and find you.

853
01:16:23.491 --> 01:16:26.538
Maria's gone.
I went to her apartment
and it's completely empty.

854
01:16:26.712 --> 01:16:28.322
Do you know
what's going on?

855
01:16:28.496 --> 01:16:30.498
Smells like moldy cheese
in here.

856
01:16:30.673 --> 01:16:32.413
Wait. did you hear
what I said? Maria--

857
01:16:32.588 --> 01:16:34.328
Maria's gone.
She's in trouble or something.

858
01:16:34.502 --> 01:16:36.853
This place could definitely use
a woman's touch.

859
01:16:37.027 --> 01:16:39.116
If I happen to meet one.
I'll be sure to let her know.

860
01:16:39.290 --> 01:16:42.772
Are either of you even
listening to me right now?Maria's fine!

861
01:16:42.946 --> 01:16:45.165
I just seen her the other day
at Rory Calhoun's office.

862
01:16:45.339 --> 01:16:46.950
Dressed like a whore. she was.

863
01:16:47.124 --> 01:16:51.389
She's probably
under his desk right now.

864
01:16:51.563 --> 01:16:52.869
No. Okay. well.

865
01:16:53.043 --> 01:16:54.435
I was actually
just up at her apartment

866
01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:55.959
and it's completely empty.

867
01:16:58.657 --> 01:17:00.093
Well. ain't that a shame.

868
01:17:00.877 --> 01:17:02.530
Hmm. Guess she moved out then.

869
01:17:03.183 --> 01:17:06.056
Too bad. I guess I never
get to fuck her after all.

870
01:17:06.230 --> 01:17:08.798
No. moved out? What?
She's not moved out.

871
01:17:08.972 --> 01:17:12.540
What do you mean. "moved out"?What you mean. "what do I mean"?
She fucking moved.

872
01:17:12.715 --> 01:17:16.283
Probably get far away
from your annoying arse.

873
01:17:18.677 --> 01:17:21.941
It ain't her
they're really after.Wait. what do you mean?

874
01:17:24.509 --> 01:17:28.208
Whoa. Whoa. Hold on.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

875
01:17:28.382 --> 01:17:31.298
I ain't gonna pretend
like I understand
what this is all about.

876
01:17:31.472 --> 01:17:35.128
but there's some people
you just can't say no to.

877
01:17:35.781 --> 01:17:38.392
What?Well. they can't
come in here.

878
01:17:38.566 --> 01:17:40.177
So they needed someone...

879
01:17:42.092 --> 01:17:43.006
on the inside.

880
01:17:43.180 --> 01:17:44.660
Whoa. Okay.

881
01:17:44.834 --> 01:17:47.140
Oh. I'm gonna see
if I can remember this properly.

882
01:17:51.492 --> 01:17:54.234
Three brothers
are traveling along a road

883
01:17:54.408 --> 01:17:57.368
and they come to an inn
where they plan
to stay the night.

884
01:17:57.542 --> 01:17:59.283
Wait. wait. stop. What?
How do you know that?

885
01:17:59.457 --> 01:18:02.025
Let me finish.

886
01:18:04.027 --> 01:18:05.028
Please.

887
01:18:06.159 --> 01:18:08.858
The cost of the room
is 30 bites of gold.

888
01:18:09.032 --> 01:18:11.687
so each of the brothers
put in ten apie--

889
01:18:15.125 --> 01:18:17.388
Sorry about that.

890
01:18:17.562 --> 01:18:19.607
As I was saying.
it's ten apiece

891
01:18:19.782 --> 01:18:24.090
so the manager wants
to give them a discount
of five gold...

892
01:18:25.788 --> 01:18:26.876
...pieces.

893
01:18:29.269 --> 01:18:31.707
What the bloody fuck
are you doing?

894
01:18:35.449 --> 01:18:37.060
What are you doing?

895
01:18:41.412 --> 01:18:43.675
So he gives five--

896
01:18:44.328 --> 01:18:47.810
...gold pieces
to the bellboy

897
01:18:47.984 --> 01:18:49.637
to take back to--

898
01:18:49.812 --> 01:18:52.292
Stop it!

899
01:18:52.466 --> 01:18:54.425
Just calm down. both of you.
Just--

900
01:18:54.599 --> 01:18:59.386
The bellboy says
he can't split five evenly...

901
01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:01.911
...among three.

902
01:19:03.173 --> 01:19:04.870
Take it easy. Jesus Christ.

903
01:19:05.044 --> 01:19:07.743
Bloody fucking hell.
FuckYou all right?

904
01:19:07.917 --> 01:19:10.571
Just run. run. run!All right. I'm just--

905
01:19:31.375 --> 01:19:34.813
Lauren works for Rory Calhoun.
You obviously know who that is.

906
01:19:44.867 --> 01:19:46.782
Maria's fine.

907
01:19:46.956 --> 01:19:49.219
I just seen her the other day
at Rory Calhoun's office.

908
01:19:49.393 --> 01:19:51.569
Dressed like a whore. she was. What the fuck.

909
01:20:07.672 --> 01:20:08.716
Oh!

910
01:20:12.982 --> 01:20:16.768
I know.

911
01:20:16.942 --> 01:20:19.075
I know. I know.
I'm sorry about all of this.

912
01:20:19.249 --> 01:20:22.556
But I got the call earlier today
and when they call.

913
01:20:23.122 --> 01:20:24.515
I have to answer.

914
01:20:26.473 --> 01:20:29.172
Because everyone
in this world

915
01:20:29.346 --> 01:20:31.043
has to answer
to somebody. right?

916
01:20:31.827 --> 01:20:35.352
Well. except for...

917
01:20:36.353 --> 01:20:37.920
...him.

918
01:20:38.572 --> 01:20:42.446
But then...
this world. am I right?

919
01:20:52.978 --> 01:20:55.024
Where's Maria?

920
01:20:56.939 --> 01:20:58.157
I'm sorry. Who's Maria?

921
01:20:58.331 --> 01:20:59.332
Come on!

922
01:21:00.290 --> 01:21:03.336
What the fuck is going--
Please.

923
01:21:04.424 --> 01:21:07.253
You know. Maria.
Where's--Oh. oh. Maria.

924
01:21:07.427 --> 01:21:08.907
Yeah. yeah. yeah.
That girl.

925
01:21:09.081 --> 01:21:10.648
That-- That actress
who sent me in

926
01:21:10.822 --> 01:21:13.825
that really weird tape. Her?

927
01:21:13.999 --> 01:21:16.567
Yeah.Yeah. okay.
How the hell should I know?

928
01:21:16.741 --> 01:21:19.483
I can't possibly
cast her in anything.

929
01:21:20.049 --> 01:21:23.139
Why do you keep calling me?

930
01:21:23.313 --> 01:21:25.663
Who's the woman
on the phone?Listen.

931
01:21:25.837 --> 01:21:29.101
I don't have the answers
you're looking for. pal. Okay?

932
01:21:30.102 --> 01:21:34.367
So. I am just doing
what I'm told.

933
01:21:34.541 --> 01:21:36.804
Now--She was--
She was--

934
01:21:36.979 --> 01:21:37.936
We really gotta go.

935
01:21:38.110 --> 01:21:39.024
Please. no. no!

936
01:22:07.574 --> 01:22:08.793
See ya. Harry.

937
01:22:11.535 --> 01:22:12.928
Yup. see you soon.

938
01:22:48.572 --> 01:22:49.965
Thank you. Rory.

939
01:22:50.139 --> 01:22:52.880
Your services
are no longer needed.

940
01:23:27.741 --> 01:23:29.917
I did try
to do it the easy way.

941
01:23:33.791 --> 01:23:36.098
You can close your eyes
if you like.

942
01:23:51.461 --> 01:23:55.030
Three brothers are traveling
along a road one night.

943
01:23:56.074 --> 01:23:57.945
They stop at an inn

944
01:23:58.903 --> 01:24:02.776
and the cost for the inn
is 30 gold pieces.

945
01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:04.474
They each pay ten.

946
01:24:05.649 --> 01:24:09.131
The manager decides
to give them a discount.

947
01:24:09.305 --> 01:24:12.308
Perhaps the inn
isn't too crowded that night.

948
01:24:14.571 --> 01:24:17.878
He gives five gold pieces
to a bellhop

949
01:24:18.053 --> 01:24:20.664
and tells him to return it
to the men.

950
01:24:22.013 --> 01:24:27.453
The bellhop decides
he cannot divide it
evenly between the three.

951
01:24:27.627 --> 01:24:30.717
so he pockets two for himself

952
01:24:30.891 --> 01:24:35.505
and returns one gold piece
to each of the men.

953
01:24:37.159 --> 01:24:40.466
Each man gets back
one gold piece.

954
01:24:41.511 --> 01:24:45.254
So now they've given
nine apiece.

955
01:24:46.168 --> 01:24:49.823
Nine. three times. is 27.

956
01:24:51.173 --> 01:24:53.958
The bellhop pocketed two.

957
01:24:54.132 --> 01:24:57.222
Add that to the 27

958
01:24:57.396 --> 01:24:59.485
and you've got 29.

959
01:25:02.532 --> 01:25:04.490
But you started with 30.

960
01:25:15.675 --> 01:25:18.113
Where is the missing piece?

961
01:25:44.748 --> 01:25:49.144
I hope you know that
this is absolutely not personal.

962
01:25:51.711 --> 01:25:55.498
The system is mostly infallible.

963
01:25:55.672 --> 01:26:01.373
I have no idea
who put it into place or why.

964
01:26:01.547 --> 01:26:02.896
But it works.

965
01:26:03.070 --> 01:26:06.161
You live. you die.
you live. you die.

966
01:26:06.944 --> 01:26:11.166
You live. you die.
and we collect these

967
01:26:12.384 --> 01:26:13.603
each time.

968
01:26:15.735 --> 01:26:21.001
But sometimes.
there is a glitch.

969
01:26:22.829 --> 01:26:28.792
Generally. nobody has any idea
why it happens.

970
01:26:28.966 --> 01:26:31.403
but in your case...

971
01:26:33.579 --> 01:26:35.102
it was the girl.

972
01:26:41.631 --> 01:26:45.025
Whatever the problem is.
when there is one...

973
01:26:50.030 --> 01:26:52.381
they send me in to clean it up.

974
01:26:54.557 --> 01:26:55.949
You should stand back.

975
01:27:25.849 --> 01:27:27.677
So how did your brother
meet this girl again?

976
01:27:27.851 --> 01:27:30.506
Susanne?
Do I call her "Susie"?

977
01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:33.465
Um. I don't know.

978
01:27:34.466 --> 01:27:38.383
I mean. I-I think
she was a friend of a friend.

979
01:27:38.557 --> 01:27:41.081
of a friend?
Something like that.

980
01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:43.823
We shall find out.

981
01:27:43.997 --> 01:27:45.956
Do you know
where we're going to eat?

982
01:27:47.174 --> 01:27:49.786
So Cory cooked.Oh. God.

983
01:27:51.788 --> 01:27:53.746
Where should you and I
go out to eat after?

984
01:27:55.966 --> 01:27:57.359
I was thinking maybe sushi?

985
01:27:59.578 --> 01:28:00.971
Did you pay the sitter?

986
01:28:01.841 --> 01:28:04.279
Yeah. Did it not go through?

987
01:28:04.453 --> 01:28:06.193
She's saying
it didn't go through.

988
01:28:06.368 --> 01:28:09.719
Likely story.Well. I'll send it again.

989
01:28:09.893 --> 01:28:12.504
She's amazing
and Ella loves her so much.

990
01:28:26.823 --> 01:28:29.347
All right. Ready?

991
01:28:30.435 --> 01:28:31.741
Let's do this.

992
01:28:54.590 --> 01:28:55.939
Babe. they're here.

993
01:28:56.113 --> 01:28:57.462
I heard the knocks.

994
01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:03.642
Hey. how are you guys?
You look fantastic.

995
01:29:03.816 --> 01:29:05.557
Thanks for coming.How you doing. buddy?

996
01:29:05.731 --> 01:29:07.864
Are you guys hungry?Starving.

997
01:29:08.038 --> 01:29:10.736
Food's almost ready.
How about a drink?Let's do it.

998
01:29:10.910 --> 01:29:13.826
Yeah. well. what is this?

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.438
