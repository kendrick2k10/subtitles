to be really flourishing.</i>

336
00:21:28.721 --> 00:21:32.034
<i>The music department
with the trio was traveling</i>

337
00:21:32.058 --> 00:21:34.225
<i>all over the United States
and giving concerts.</i>

338
00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:39.730
There was a telegram.
would we consider recording

339
00:21:39.798 --> 00:21:42.600
the Schubert Trio in B flat
for Capitol Records?

340
00:21:47.339 --> 00:21:50.608
<i>The English department was
publishing its own books.</i>

341
00:21:50.675 --> 00:21:52.543
<i>The science people were getting</i>

342
00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:54.889
<i>government grants
to do research.</i>

343
00:21:54.913 --> 00:21:57.548
<i>The drama department was
bringing in directors</i>

344
00:21:57.615 --> 00:22:01.385
<i>from England and Ireland
to do plays with our students.</i>

345
00:22:05.557 --> 00:22:08.025
Of course. by that time
the biggest excitement

346
00:22:08.093 --> 00:22:11.362
and publicity was centered
around the art department.

347
00:22:11.429 --> 00:22:14.332
<i>where Corita
was doing her serigraphs.</i>

348
00:22:53.138 --> 00:22:59.588
[Mickey]<i> I think that what drove
Corita to become an artist was</i>

349
00:22:59.612 --> 00:23:02.079
<i>the circumstance
that she found herself in.</i>

350
00:23:02.147 --> 00:23:05.816
She was part of a community.
and she needed to make

351
00:23:05.884 --> 00:23:07.863
a contribution
to that community.

352
00:23:07.887 --> 00:23:12.089
And this is what came
naturally to her.

353
00:23:12.157 --> 00:23:15.893
<i>In the early days. especially.
I was trying to make quote.</i>

354
00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:20.698
<i>"religious art" that would be not quite
as repulsive as what was around.</i> [laughs]

355
00:23:26.371 --> 00:23:31.242
<i>The work that Corita did was
dealing with religious subjects</i>

356
00:23:31.309 --> 00:23:33.210
<i>in a very unusual way.</i>

357
00:23:38.116 --> 00:23:41.919
So. this piece is representative
of Corita's earlier work.

358
00:23:41.986 --> 00:23:43.621
It's called <i>At Cana of Galilee.</i>

359
00:23:47.526 --> 00:23:51.840
<i>Corita's early work
is very biblical.</i>

360
00:23:51.864 --> 00:23:58.202
<i>very much the product of
someone who is exploring spirituality.</i>

361
00:24:00.271 --> 00:24:04.608
<i>The usual classical pictures
of Mary and the saints</i>

362
00:24:04.676 --> 00:24:07.912
<i>and Jesus were totally
different in her eyes.</i>

363
00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:18.322
The negative reaction from the
archdioceses happened right away.

364
00:24:22.694 --> 00:24:25.463
[Marian]<i> The cardinal</i>
<i>couldn't stand Corita's art.</i>

365
00:24:26.431 --> 00:24:29.366
<i>His idea of a Christmas card was</i>

366
00:24:29.434 --> 00:24:32.214
<i>the child Jesus in the
manger with the shepherds.</i>

367
00:24:32.238 --> 00:24:34.883
<i>and Corita's idea of
a Christmas card was a splash</i>

368
00:24:34.907 --> 00:24:39.176
<i>of red. black. blue. green.
or gold. and calligraphy.</i>

369
00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:44.315
They were very. very nice
cards. we thought.

370
00:24:45.283 --> 00:24:46.550
Well. the cardinal didn't.

371
00:24:46.618 --> 00:24:49.420
but then he had no idea
what was good art.

372
00:24:57.295 --> 00:25:00.498
<i>There are letters from the
Archdiocese asking Corita</i>

373
00:25:00.565 --> 00:25:06.548
<i>not to depict the holy family because
it was disturbing to parishioners.</i>

374
00:25:06.572 --> 00:25:10.174
<i>So. she is kind of forced
to move into the direction</i>

375
00:25:10.241 --> 00:25:13.622
<i>that she moved into with her work.
where she was using a lot more text</i>

376
00:25:13.646 --> 00:25:16.291
<i>and she was using figures
because she was forbidden</i>

377
00:25:16.315 --> 00:25:18.582
<i>from depicting
the holy family. specifically.</i>

378
00:25:25.189 --> 00:25:27.791
The '60s were a time
when people were saying.

379
00:25:27.859 --> 00:25:30.060
"Open up your minds
to what's going on."

380
00:25:31.663 --> 00:25:35.777
<i>And the college was very
much part of that world.</i>

381
00:25:35.801 --> 00:25:38.869
<i>But this was a very
conservative Catholic community</i>

382
00:25:38.937 --> 00:25:40.181
<i>in southern California.</i>

383
00:25:40.205 --> 00:25:41.872
<i>to the degree
that good Catholics</i>

384
00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:44.542
<i>were not sending their daughters
to Immaculate Heart College</i>

385
00:25:44.609 --> 00:25:47.044
because they felt it
was a little dangerous.

386
00:25:51.016 --> 00:25:56.687
So. at a certain point. the cardinal
started censoring the faculty.

387
00:26:00.091 --> 00:26:04.028
[Francis]<i> The problem with
Immaculate Heart College was that it was</i>

388
00:26:04.095 --> 00:26:07.275
<i>very difficult for many
Catholics to endure</i>

389
00:26:07.299 --> 00:26:10.901
because the one thing
people hate is change.

390
00:26:19.244 --> 00:26:22.446
<i>It's very ordinary
for churches and schools</i>

391
00:26:22.513 --> 00:26:26.784
who are Catholic to celebrate
a day in May in honor of Mary.

392
00:26:29.254 --> 00:26:31.455
[Marian]<i> Mary's Day had
been a very formal occasion.</i>

393
00:26:31.522 --> 00:26:33.857
The students all wore
cap and gown

394
00:26:33.925 --> 00:26:36.727
and carried white lilies.
It was quite dreadful.

395
00:26:42.467 --> 00:26:44.379
<i>I guess it was
the first year that</i>

396
00:26:44.403 --> 00:26:46.737
I was president of the college.

397
00:26:46.804 --> 00:26:50.207
<i>Corita herself came along
and said...</i>

398
00:26:55.813 --> 00:26:59.461
And she said. "Isn't
Mary's Day kind of trite

399
00:26:59.485 --> 00:27:04.933
and traditional. and not
utilizing all of our talents?"

400
00:27:04.957 --> 00:27:08.336
<i>And I said. "Well. yeah.
probably that's so.</i>

401
00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.628
<i>Are you willing to plan
something better?"</i>

402
00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:25.643
Well. this Mary's Day. I guess
you could say that about all

403
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:29.246
Mary's Day. that we begin by.

404
00:27:29.313 --> 00:27:32.961
we tried to in the art
department to make things

405
00:27:32.985 --> 00:27:35.452
which will give the campus
a different look.

406
00:27:46.197 --> 00:27:48.132
<i>We would try to have
a theme each year.</i>

407
00:27:48.199 --> 00:27:51.669
<i>and in those years especially.
I think there was</i>

408
00:27:51.736 --> 00:27:54.849
<i>so much happening that it was
usually a social justice theme</i>

409
00:27:54.873 --> 00:27:56.273
<i>underlying it.</i>

410
00:28:24.436 --> 00:28:26.870
<i>Mary's Day was lots of fun.</i>

411
00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:33.644
I loved. you know. getting
those flowers around my habit

412
00:28:33.711 --> 00:28:36.447
<i>and doing
the dance on the lawn and...</i>

413
00:28:38.583 --> 00:28:41.362
<i>I thought it was the kind
of celebration that churches</i>

414
00:28:41.386 --> 00:28:43.454
<i>ought to have regularly.</i>

415
00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:49.571
<i>We did all these things
to visually represent how Mary</i>

416
00:28:49.595 --> 00:28:52.240
<i>was seen by the people
at the college.</i>

417
00:28:52.264 --> 00:28:56.066
<i>which was as an inspiration
to all things good and holy.</i>

418
00:29:30.501 --> 00:29:34.883
<i>It was picked up very quickly by
the newspapers and magazines.</i>

419
00:29:34.907 --> 00:29:37.908
<i>That. of course.
drew much criticism</i>

420
00:29:37.975 --> 00:29:39.610
<i>from the cardinal's office.</i>

421
00:29:40.578 --> 00:29:42.446
[gasps] They thought it
was blasphemous.

422
00:29:43.848 --> 00:29:45.849
[foreboding music playing]

423
00:29:51.322 --> 00:29:55.926
<i>The cardinal talked about Mary's
Day being a scandalous thing.</i>

424
00:29:58.129 --> 00:30:00.464
<i>Offensive to the faithful.</i>

425
00:30:03.735 --> 00:30:07.715
<i>It wasn't his cup of</i>
<i>tea. shall we say.</i> [laughs]

426
00:30:07.739 --> 00:30:11.141
<i>And he kept saying
that our alumni</i>

427
00:30:11.209 --> 00:30:13.054
<i>were complaining to him.</i>

428
00:30:13.078 --> 00:30:14.511
<i>And that's quite possible.</i>

429
00:30:14.545 --> 00:30:17.759
<i>There were some very
conservative alumni.</i>

430
00:30:17.783 --> 00:30:21.285
<i>But he had something in
for Corita. so the fact that</i>

431
00:30:21.352 --> 00:30:25.266
<i>she was involved in the
planning of it didn't help.</i>

432
00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:27.558
Clouds were gathering
over that congregation.

433
00:30:27.625 --> 00:30:30.661
I mean. that cardinal was not
gonna put up with those uppity women.

434
00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:36.477
<i>The Immaculate Heart sisters.
and all of these new ideas.</i>

435
00:30:36.501 --> 00:30:40.548
<i>all became irritants to his
perception of what should be</i>

436
00:30:40.572 --> 00:30:42.139
<i>and what ought to be.</i>

437
00:30:43.641 --> 00:30:45.242
[woman]<i> And then</i>
<i>the following summer.</i>

438
00:30:45.309 --> 00:30:49.646
<i>Corita developed these
series of her prints.</i>

439
00:30:53.551 --> 00:30:57.487
<i>That series was received
publicly like wildfire.</i>

440
00:31:00.024 --> 00:31:03.293
[man]<i> The one that drove him</i>
<i>berserk was that one of Mary.</i>

441
00:31:03.361 --> 00:31:06.296
<i>"She scrawled across it. " Mary.</i>

442
00:31:06.364 --> 00:31:11.034
<i>the juiciest tomato
of them all."</i> [laughing]

443
00:31:11.102 --> 00:31:12.870
Well. at that point.
he had had enough.

444
00:31:18.576 --> 00:31:21.979
<i>The most dramatic moment
of Cardinal McIntyre's</i>

445
00:31:22.046 --> 00:31:26.149
<i>disapproval was he had announced
that he was coming to visit us.</i>

446
00:31:29.387 --> 00:31:32.256
<i>The general counsel was having
its meeting and the cardinal</i>

447
00:31:32.323 --> 00:31:37.527
<i>came in upon it and told us
that we were becoming</i>

448
00:31:37.595 --> 00:31:41.732
<i>much too modern. that we would
have to follow what he said.</i>

449
00:31:41.799 --> 00:31:44.445
<i>He scared me most when he said.</i>

450
00:31:44.469 --> 00:31:47.804
<i>"If this goes on. I shall
have to close the college."</i>

451
00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:51.653
<i>At the end of
the conversation he said.</i>

452
00:31:51.677 --> 00:31:53.810
<i>"You will suffer for this."</i>

453
00:31:59.884 --> 00:32:01.985
[church bell rings]

454
00:32:03.955 --> 00:32:05.689
[Clement]<i> He was afraid.</i>

455
00:32:05.756 --> 00:32:07.424
<i>He was afraid for the church.</i>

456
00:32:09.627 --> 00:32:13.541
Because the whole issue
was caught in the middle

457
00:32:13.565 --> 00:32:16.733
of a much. much larger contest.

458
00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:26.955
<i>I think that we have to trace
our entire movement</i>

459
00:32:26.979 --> 00:32:32.293
back to our precedent
breaking event. Vatican II.

460
00:32:32.317 --> 00:32:38.188
There came about a period of
profound discovery in our church.

461
00:32:38.255 --> 00:32:42.971
First of all. I think it was a
discovery of the modern world.

462
00:32:42.995 --> 00:32:45.062
[man]<i> The Vatican Ecumenical</i>
<i>Council.</i>

463
00:32:45.129 --> 00:32:47.531
<i>This is only the second
in 400 years.</i>

464
00:32:47.598 --> 00:32:51.935
<i>The council's immediate aim is to make church
laws more compatible with modern times.</i>

465
00:32:54.238 --> 00:32:57.452
[man 2]<i> The council produced</i>
<i>16 documents designed</i>

466
00:32:57.476 --> 00:33:00.610
<i>to modernize the role of
the church in world affairs.</i>

467
00:33:01.946 --> 00:33:07.617
All the decrees of Vatican II
brought enormous change

468
00:33:07.685 --> 00:33:10.420
<i>to the culture of the church.</i>

469
00:33:10.488 --> 00:33:15.603
<i>For instance. the mass changed
to be set in the local language</i>

470
00:33:15.627 --> 00:33:18.028
<i>instead of in Latin.</i>

471
00:33:18.095 --> 00:33:21.031
<i>And in the pre-Vatican II days
there was this whole thing</i>

472
00:33:21.098 --> 00:33:24.101
<i>about women's blood
being polluting.</i>

473
00:33:24.168 --> 00:33:28.816
<i>And so. women were not
allowed into the sanctuary.</i>

474
00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:35.423
<i>But. you suddenly had women
serving in the area around the altar.</i>

475
00:33:35.447 --> 00:33:37.381
That sent shockwaves.

476
00:33:43.054 --> 00:33:46.656
- Depends on what the question is.
- [all laughing]

477
00:33:46.724 --> 00:33:50.304
[Pat]<i> Cardinal McIntyre had been
at the Second Vatican Council.</i>

478
00:33:50.328 --> 00:33:54.931
<i>We think he voted against every
single document that was passed.</i>

479
00:33:54.999 --> 00:33:58.112
There would only be about 11
votes against these beautiful

480
00:33:58.136 --> 00:34:01.671
documents and we was sure
his was one of them. [laughs]

481
00:34:01.739 --> 00:34:04.318
<i>That was a hard transition.</i>

482
00:34:04.342 --> 00:34:07.855
And I don't think that
Cardinal McIntyre.

483
00:34:07.879 --> 00:34:11.348
people of his generation.
were reasonably prepared

484
00:34:11.415 --> 00:34:13.550
for the radical nature
of the change.

485
00:34:20.157 --> 00:34:21.669
[Clement]<i> People were polarized.</i>

486
00:34:21.693 --> 00:34:23.760
<i>The church was polarized.</i>

487
00:34:23.828 --> 00:34:26.096
I'm really not happy
with the change.

488
00:34:26.163 --> 00:34:31.479
It's very distracting. these new
modern methods they have for mass.

489
00:34:31.503 --> 00:34:33.236
I think the church has
a right to change.

490
00:34:33.304 --> 00:34:37.507
There can be no change
in the divine institution

491
00:34:37.575 --> 00:34:40.210
and constitution of the church.

492
00:34:48.519 --> 00:34:51.432
[Helen]<i> In the face of all
that was going on in the world.</i>

493

<i>we were in danger of becoming
somewhat irrelevant</i>

494
00:34:54.726 --> 00:34:57.661
and of taking the easy way.

495
00:34:57.728 --> 00:35:01.131
Do what you're told.
Don't rock the boat.

496
00:35:01.198 --> 00:35:03.578
And. uh. clearly we were
in a boat that

497
00:35:03.602 --> 00:35:05.435

later for her.

650
00:46:21.545 --> 00:46:25.882
It seemed like more late-'60s
that there was a little bit

It's all representative
of her style of work.

but you have a piece
like<i> The American Sampler.</i>

intense criticism of Vietnam.

<i>that she created.

669
00:47:32.149 --> 00:47:34.661
<i>by a group of parish priests.</i>

670
00:47:34.685 --> 00:47:38.465
<i>which would have been
impossible for Corita</i>

671
00:47:38.489 --> 00:47:40.756
<i>and would have caused a good
deal of laughter. really.</i>

672
00:47:44.861 --> 00:47:48.842
<i>The way she took things like
that was always as a joke.</i>

673
00:47:48.866 --> 00:47:50.177
It didn't mean anything to her.

674
00:47:50.201 --> 00:47:51.845
You know. she would
just not do it.

675
00:47:51.869 --> 00:47:52.702
[no audio]

676
00:48:01.211 --> 00:48:03.190
<i>The negative attention
that she was getting</i>

677
00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:06.749
<i>from the Archdiocese just
fueled the fire and just really kept</i>

678
00:48:06.816 --> 00:48:10.052
<i>the snowball of her fame
and her recognition going.</i>

679
00:48:14.625 --> 00:48:16.692
<i>Corita's work was being sold.</i>

680
00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:19.095
<i>It was on the covers
of magazines.</i>

681
00:48:21.431 --> 00:48:24.367
<i>She was having exhibits
all over the world.</i>

682
00:48:29.506 --> 00:48:32.842
<i>She was on the Christmas</i>
<i>issue of</i> Newsweek<i> magazine.</i>

683
00:48:32.909 --> 00:48:35.945
as the literal cover girl
for the modern nun.

684
00:48:37.647 --> 00:48:39.693
[man]<i> As she was becoming</i>
<i>more and more famed.</i>

685
00:48:39.717 --> 00:48:41.851
<i>she was also becoming braver.</i>

686
00:48:41.918 --> 00:48:44.387
I suppose that
if you're devious enough.

687
00:48:44.454 --> 00:48:47.390
I think you can work
it to your own end.

688
00:48:47.457 --> 00:48:48.969
To your own end.

689
00:48:48.993 --> 00:48:50.904
Yes. I think sister Corita
has given us

690
00:48:50.928 --> 00:48:53.663
the sense that nothing
need be taboo.

691
00:48:55.598 --> 00:49:01.337
[woman]<i> Corita was fortunate to
be one of a dynamic group of women.</i>

692
00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:08.188
They were highly educated
women who were tasting freedom

693
00:49:08.212 --> 00:49:09.478
and liking the taste.

694
00:49:17.087 --> 00:49:18.799
Is it thought to
be a characteristic

695
00:49:18.823 --> 00:49:20.867
of nuns that they should
have pride?

696
00:49:20.891 --> 00:49:23.092
[gasps] Oh. no. Not at all.

697
00:49:23.159 --> 00:49:26.429
Humility is considered really
the basic virtue

698
00:49:26.496 --> 00:49:31.678
of the so-called religious virtues
or virtues of the religious life.

699
00:49:31.702 --> 00:49:33.336
- But. see-- - [man] You
don't agree with that. do you?

700
00:49:34.304 --> 00:49:36.572
Well. I do.
if you define humility

701
00:49:36.639 --> 00:49:38.841
<i>rather carefully as truth.</i>

702
00:49:38.908 --> 00:49:42.356
<i>And in that comes a very
simple acknowledgment</i>

703
00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:44.513
<i>of what you are and what
you are supposed to do.</i>

704
00:49:44.581 --> 00:49:47.450
<i>But if you think of humility
as a kind of cloak.</i>

705
00:49:47.517 --> 00:49:52.299
<i>of kind of subservience.
conformity. that looks good.</i>

706
00:49:52.323 --> 00:49:56.370
but it's very easy to look
humble and not be at all.

707
00:49:56.394 --> 00:49:58.171
How does one judge humility.
you know?

708
00:49:58.195 --> 00:49:59.795
I mean. how do you measure it?

709
00:49:59.863 --> 00:50:01.998
Um. which people
really are humble?

710
00:50:02.065 --> 00:50:03.032
It's hard to say.

711
00:50:13.276 --> 00:50:16.078
[man]<i> In keeping with the
modernization of Catholic liturgy</i>

712
00:50:16.146 --> 00:50:18.825
<i>and ecumenical thought.
the tradition-bound</i>

713
00:50:18.849 --> 00:50:21.217
<i>dress of nuns is being
altered radically.</i>

714
00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:26.600
<i>The official document that
came out of Vatican II said.</i>

715
00:50:26.624 --> 00:50:28.224
<i>"experiment in stages."</i>

716
00:50:30.693 --> 00:50:34.141
<i>And then after a few years.
good scientific method.</i>

717
00:50:34.165 --> 00:50:36.143
<i>you re-examine them again.</i>

718
00:50:36.167 --> 00:50:40.970
<i>So. as all the little changes
and experiments continued.</i>

719
00:50:41.905 --> 00:50:43.305
<i>we began to see more</i>

720
00:50:43.339 --> 00:50:45.508
<i>and more discussion
on the issue of the habit.</i>

721
00:50:47.644 --> 00:50:51.625
Why dressing as
a medieval woman dresses

722
00:50:51.649 --> 00:50:55.362
would make one
more Christian. more holy?

723
00:50:55.386 --> 00:50:58.632
It's hard now to figure out.

724
00:50:58.656 --> 00:51:01.257
<i>We have to drive cars.
we have to board planes.</i>

725
00:51:01.324 --> 00:51:03.437
<i>We have to do all
kinds of things</i>

726
00:51:03.461 --> 00:51:05.628
<i>that make this out of place.</i>

727
00:51:08.465 --> 00:51:10.066
[Pat speaking]

728
00:51:22.079 --> 00:51:24.591
[man]<i> Until recently. the nuns</i>
<i>had no personal possessions</i>

729
00:51:24.615 --> 00:51:25.548
<i>and no money.</i>

730
00:51:28.751 --> 00:51:31.420
<i>Now they are given $20 a month
to dress as modern women.</i>

731
00:51:31.488 --> 00:51:34.223
Did you look at the 14s down
here or did you just look at the 12s?

732
00:51:34.290 --> 00:51:35.691
I think we only looked at 12s.

733
00:51:36.493 --> 00:51:38.227
Let's go down this way. then.

734
00:51:40.764 --> 00:51:42.932
[woman]<i> It wasn't universal</i>
<i>at first.</i>

735
00:51:42.966 --> 00:51:45.401
<i>Certain groups would try
this and try that.</i>

736
00:51:52.642 --> 00:51:55.077
<i>And then it was to be voted on.</i>

737
00:51:59.516 --> 00:52:02.896
[Anita]<i> Somehow now with the
changing into contemporary clothing.</i>

738
00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:06.255
<i>the habit has become
a symbol of a whole system</i>

739
00:52:06.322 --> 00:52:08.724
<i>of uniformity and conformity</i>

740
00:52:08.791 --> 00:52:12.461
<i>in which we no longer believe
as we did before.</i>

741
00:52:12.529 --> 00:52:15.865
I personally would find it
very difficult to return.

742
00:52:25.709 --> 00:52:27.643
[man] How long is it since
you've worn the habit?

743
00:52:29.479 --> 00:52:33.949
Since last October. which I
guess is about six months. isn't it?

744
00:52:34.017 --> 00:52:35.996
[man] And now that you've got
your habit on again.

745
00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:38.420
do you really feel exactly
the same dressed like that

746
00:52:38.488 --> 00:52:40.333
as you do
in your ordinary clothes?

747
00:52:40.357 --> 00:52:41.190
No.

748
00:52:42.892 --> 00:52:45.272
I never realized that
till just now. I don't think.

749
00:52:45.296 --> 00:52:46.673
but no. I don't.

750
00:52:46.697 --> 00:52:50.210
<i>That experience with him.
just in a few minutes...</i>

751
00:52:50.234 --> 00:52:54.236
was a lesson for me because I
had actually argued against changing

752
00:52:54.304 --> 00:52:56.082
the habit in the beginning
of the whole thing.

753
00:52:56.106 --> 00:52:59.575
I thought it was
a kind of silly issue.

754
00:52:59.642 --> 00:53:04.113
[man] Does anybody here feel that it's
a pity that they've removed the habit?

755
00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:07.850
Well. I know that
having a woman in some

756
00:53:07.917 --> 00:53:12.365
kind of dress from completely
another period automatically

757
00:53:12.389 --> 00:53:13.722
does put up a barrier.

758
00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:15.724
In this way.
you know that they are people.

759
00:53:15.792 --> 00:53:17.526
They are now people.

760
00:53:17.594 --> 00:53:19.239
[man] I find you completely
different.

761
00:53:19.263 --> 00:53:21.664
I find my response to you
totally different now.

762
00:53:23.533 --> 00:53:24.844
And I've seen you
and talked to you

763
00:53:24.868 --> 00:53:26.112
in your civilian clothes.

764
00:53:26.136 --> 00:53:28.404
I would want to ask you what
you mean by totally different?

765
00:53:29.272 --> 00:53:31.051
I feel a certain kind of...

766
00:53:31.075 --> 00:53:34.187
uh. an awareness of the fact
that you won't ever be able

767
00:53:34.211 --> 00:53:35.522
to agree with any point of view

768
00:53:35.546 --> 00:53:37.791
that I may hold on
any serious subject

769
00:53:37.815 --> 00:53:42.017
that will always be modified
by the odor of sanctity.

770
00:53:42.085 --> 00:53:45.487
And secondly. that I have got
to censor my speech.

771
00:53:45.555 --> 00:53:48.624
my activities.
and the way I express things

772
00:53:48.691 --> 00:53:51.660
so as not to put you
in an awkward position.

773
00:54:16.319 --> 00:54:18.520
- Abstinence.
- [all laughing]

774
00:54:18.588 --> 00:54:21.590
[Lenore]<i> On the one hand.</i>
<i>it was an exciting time.</i>

775
00:54:21.658 --> 00:54:26.895
<i>but there were also some sisters
who did not approve of the changes.</i>

776
00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:47.016
<i>It was pretty scary.
because we knew that among us</i>

777
00:54:47.083 --> 00:54:52.321
there was the sabotage
of our plans.

778
00:54:57.427 --> 00:55:02.975
[Pat]<i> Gatherings of a small group
were being held in our own premises.</i>

779
00:55:02.999 --> 00:55:06.413
<i>The two people who led
that group. Sister Joanne.</i>

780
00:55:06.437 --> 00:55:11.151
and Sister Eileen.
were hypocrites.

781
00:55:11.175 --> 00:55:13.286
Excuse me.
but they were hypocrites.

782
00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:18.180
[Marian]<i> They said what they
wanted was to restore the original</i>

783
00:55:18.247 --> 00:55:21.628
religious spirit in the
community. which struck me

784
00:55:21.652 --> 00:55:24.520
as being rather strange.
because they didn't always turn up

785
00:55:24.587 --> 00:55:26.955
for prayers
when the rest of us did.

786
00:55:29.859 --> 00:55:32.795
[Rita]<i> Sister Eileen kept</i>
<i>Cardinal McIntyre</i>

787
00:55:32.862 --> 00:55:35.864
<i>totally in touch
with what was happening.</i>

788
00:55:35.932 --> 00:55:37.644
I know she did.

789
00:55:37.668 --> 00:55:41.937
Because she would tell us the
different things that she was telling him.

790
00:55:43.206 --> 00:55:47.787
<i>They were like little spies
inside the community that</i>

791
00:55:47.811 --> 00:55:50.079
<i>reported all the little changes</i>

792
00:55:50.146 --> 00:55:52.348
<i>and experiments to the cardinal.</i>

793
00:55:54.684 --> 00:55:58.087
<i>She had him around
her little finger</i>

794
00:55:58.154 --> 00:56:00.489
<i>and he called her
his little angel.</i>

795
00:56:00.556 --> 00:56:02.858
And I mean. it's just "blech."

796
00:56:04.827 --> 00:56:07.596
<i>It's like having
an enemy within your camp.</i>

797
00:56:09.899 --> 00:56:13.869
They just decided. I guess.
that there would be a conflict.

798
00:56:14.637 --> 00:56:15.704
which there was.

799
00:56:22.445 --> 00:56:24.157
[man clears throat]

800
00:56:24.181 --> 00:56:28.417
[man]<i> Do you know why your
community is being investigated?</i>

801
00:56:29.719 --> 00:56:34.590
The cardinal decided on
a new method of bringing.

802
00:56:34.657 --> 00:56:37.259
um. correction
into the community.

803
00:56:37.326 --> 00:56:41.374
And that was by sending
a group of priests

804
00:56:41.398 --> 00:56:43.977
<i>to interrogate
every sister about</i>

805
00:56:44.001 --> 00:56:46.846
<i>what she thought of the way
the community was going.</i>

806
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:48.270
[man]<i> Don't you think</i>
<i>it will take</i>

807
00:56:48.337 --> 00:56:51.807
<i>too much time to fix your hair if
you were to change your habit?</i>

808
00:56:51.874 --> 00:56:54.187
[man 2]<i> Is the rule of silence</i>
<i>being kept?</i>

809
00:56:54.211 --> 00:56:56.545
[man 3]<i> Where will</i>
<i>all of this experimentation</i>

810
00:56:56.612 --> 00:56:58.013
<i>lead your community?</i>

811
00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:02.451
Each of us were interviewed several
times by different representatives.

812
00:57:05.755 --> 00:57:08.891
I prefer not to go
into the details

813
00:57:08.958 --> 00:57:11.671
because they are really
rather embarrassing.

814
00:57:11.695 --> 00:57:13.807
[man]<i> Do you think</i>
<i>the sisters' sex life</i>

815
00:57:13.831 --> 00:57:15.408
<i>is affected by reading novels?</i>

816
00:57:15.432 --> 00:57:18.434
[man 2]<i> Do you know how</i>
<i>pornographic</i> Ulysses<i> is?</i>

817
00:57:18.501 --> 00:57:21.470
[man 3]<i> Do you want to look like
a floozy on Hollywood Boulevard?</i>

818
00:57:26.776 --> 00:57:31.380
[Anita]<i> And then they relayed
the message back to the cardinal</i>

819
00:57:31.447 --> 00:57:34.761
<i>that our community
was moving too fast</i>

820
00:57:34.785 --> 00:57:39.154
and that we were very much
determined on our progression.

821
00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:51.533
<i>By the time we came to 1967.</i>

822
00:57:51.601 --> 00:57:54.470
we had an assembly
for the community

823
00:57:54.537 --> 00:57:58.651
as a whole to vote
for all the changes

824
00:57:58.675 --> 00:58:01.076
<i>that we had been introducing.</i>

825
00:58:02.745 --> 00:58:04.413
[speaking]

826
00:58:07.083 --> 00:58:10.686
Everybody had been studying
the issues and we were quite

827
00:58:10.753 --> 00:58:12.688
well-prepared for this assembly.

828
00:58:28.104 --> 00:58:30.372
I had trepidation
only. you know.

829
00:58:30.439 --> 00:58:32.007
for politically
what might happen to us.

830
00:58:49.392 --> 00:58:52.572
<i>We knew Cardinal McIntyre
had told us very early that</i>

[Anita]<i> Yeah.</i>

834
00:59:16.485 --> 00:59:21.023
[Lenore]<i> My feeling was that
those in authority in the Archdiocese</i>

835
00:59:21.090 --> 00:59:23.792
were intrusive and unjust.

836
00:59:24.494 --> 00:59:28.074
And that as women religious.

837
00:59:28.098 --> 00:59:31.700
<i>we could determine
our own destiny.</i>

838
00:59:31.734 --> 00:59:34.747
[woman]<i> It was time to just
take the bull by the horns</i>

839
00:59:34.771 --> 00:59:38.307

851
01:00:37.367 --> 01:00:38.500

858
01:01:06.729 --> 01:01:08.975

If you look back on it now.
I feel it's really a marvelous.

861
01:01:19.875 --> 01:01:21.743

[woman]<i> It must have been a
terrible shock for the cardinal.</i>

866
01:01:43.365 --> 01:01:46.535
Because he'd never come up
against anything like this before.

867

[man speaking]

868
01:01:59.648 --> 01:02:02.228
[man]<i> It would appear</i>
<i>the action of the chapter</i>

869
01:02:02.252 --> 01:02:06.455
<i>presents to the Archdiocese
of Los Angeles an ultimatum.</i>

870
01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:12.260
<i>Our policy as stated
is that we wish sisters</i>

871
01:02:12.328 --> 01:02:16.843
<i>teaching in our parochial
schools to wear a uniform habit</i>

872
01:02:16.867 --> 01:02:20.513
<i>that is immediately recognizable
as the garb of a woman</i>

873
01:02:20.537 --> 01:02:24.717
<i>dedicated to the service
of God in religion.</i>

874
01:02:24.741 --> 01:02:29.678
They were expected
to wear a habit in teaching

875
01:02:29.745 --> 01:02:31.546
because they'd always
worn a habit.

876
01:02:31.614 --> 01:02:34.393
[man]<i> It is evident</i>
<i>therefore that the decision</i>

877
01:02:34.417 --> 01:02:36.618
<i>rests with your community.</i>

878
01:02:40.289 --> 01:02:43.736
[Anita]<i> Changing clothes

01:02:46.629 --> 01:02:49.231
So why is that
so important to him?

881
01:02:51.033 --> 01:02:52.211
<i>It was important to him</i>

882
01:02:52.235 --> 01:02:56.682
<i>because the habit signified
that we belonged to the church</i>

883
01:02:56.706 --> 01:03:00.008
<i>and therefore we belonged
under his authority also.</i>

884
01:03:01.644 --> 01:03:05.958
We just knew that nothing we
would do or explain would ever

885
01:03:05.982 --> 01:03:08.049
<i>make sense to him.</i>

886
01:03:08.117 --> 01:03:11.453
[woman]<i> Your eminence.</i>
<i>we did not close our ears</i>

<i>to your request

888
01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:17.503
<i>We struggled. however.
to find some way in which</i>

889
01:03:17.527 --> 01:03:21.196
<i>your authority and our
autonomy might be reconciled.</i>

890
01:03:22.798 --> 01:03:25.778
<i>At this time
we conclude reluctantly</i>

01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:28.603
<i>that we are indeed
at an impasse.</i>

[man]<i> My dear Mother Humiliata.</i>

894
01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:42.595

01:03:42.619 --> 01:03:45.798
<i>we shall proceed to arrange

897
01:03:49.792 --> 01:03:52.227
This was like a bombshell.

898
01:03:52.294 --> 01:03:53.739
[Marian]<i> I couldn't believe it.</i>

899
01:03:53.763 --> 01:03:56.498
And some people took it.
I think. very hard.

900
01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:09.110
He fired us from the schools.
and that's a whole

901
01:04:09.178 --> 01:04:11.290
lot of schools
and a whole lot of people.

902
01:04:11.314 --> 01:04:12.247
Two hundred some people.

903
01:04:13.515 --> 01:04:17.052
<i>For him. our leaving
the schools was not good.</i>

904
01:04:17.119 --> 01:04:19.721
<i>because he had to fill
all the positions</i>

905
01:04:19.788 --> 01:04:21.690
<i>in the schools that we left.</i>

906
01:04:28.731 --> 01:04:30.065
[Rosa] That was my class.

907
01:04:35.071 --> 01:04:36.805
<i>From six years of age on.</i>

908
01:04:36.872 --> 01:04:39.808
<i>I wanted to be with
the Immaculate Heart sisters.</i>

909
01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:42.210
<i>So. I went
to Queen of Angels Elementary</i>

910
01:04:42.278 --> 01:04:44.346
<i>and Queen of Angels High School.</i>

911
01:04:44.413 --> 01:04:47.682
During the time of the changes
in their group.

912
01:04:48.550 --> 01:04:49.417
There.

913
01:04:50.886 --> 01:04:54.890
<i>They helped me to expand
what I knew about the world</i>

914
01:04:54.957 --> 01:04:56.191
<i>and to think critically.</i>

915
01:04:56.959 --> 01:04:59.895
<i>to question authority.</i>

916
01:04:59.962 --> 01:05:02.097
<i>I think that that was
a very important thing for...</i>

917
01:05:03.098 --> 01:05:07.435
for young women of color
to be able to absorb.

918
01:05:08.704 --> 01:05:10.016
[man]<i> This Catholic high school</i>

919
01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:13.085
<i>in downtown Los Angeles
will be closed for lack of staff</i>

920
01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:17.023
<i>when the sisters of the Immaculate
Heart leave the classrooms.</i>

921
01:05:17.047 --> 01:05:21.149
<i>The school specializes in giving
chances to children from racial minorities.</i>

922
01:05:22.651 --> 01:05:25.765
[Rosa]<i> It was easier. I guess.</i>
<i>to close that school down.</i>

923
01:05:25.789 --> 01:05:28.768
<i>than to close down another
place where there were people</i>

924
01:05:28.792 --> 01:05:30.125
<i>with more resources.</i>

925
01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:33.161
[man speaking]

926
01:05:39.401 --> 01:05:41.069
- No. Not at all.
- No. Not at all.

927
01:05:41.804 --> 01:05:43.582
Yes. I know those girls.

928
01:05:43.606 --> 01:05:46.385
<i>Although it does hurt us.
and it hurts us very deeply.</i>

929
01:05:46.409 --> 01:05:47.586
We welcome it in a way.

930
01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:49.855
because we know
that this change has been...

931
01:05:49.879 --> 01:05:52.414
It's been a long time coming.
and we need it.

932
01:05:52.481 --> 01:05:56.128
When I was there. we had books
that were falling apart in our hands.

933
01:05:56.152 --> 01:05:58.064
and they were very outdated.

934
01:05:58.088 --> 01:06:00.088
<i>And the classes were crowded.</i>

935
01:06:00.155 --> 01:06:03.024
<i>fifty kids plus to one teacher.</i>

936
01:06:03.092 --> 01:06:07.028
<i>And many times that teacher
was fresh out of high school herself.</i>

937
01:06:07.096 --> 01:06:09.364
<i>We're still willing to do it
because we know that</i>

938
01:06:09.431 --> 01:06:12.945
the sisters are a very small
part of a large movement

939
01:06:12.969 --> 01:06:15.337
that has to take place
and is going to take place.

940
01:06:20.042 --> 01:06:23.244
<i>These girls were demonstrating
in front of the Chancery Office</i>

941
01:06:23.312 --> 01:06:26.492
<i>to ask the cardinal
to leave our school open.</i>

942
01:06:26.516 --> 01:06:28.183
<i>They said that he met with them</i>

943
01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:29.784
<i>but he had nothing
to say to them</i>

944
01:06:29.852 --> 01:06:31.987
except. "May God have
mercy on your soul."

945
01:06:32.054 --> 01:06:34.656
and sent them on their way.
and they came down in tears

946
01:06:34.723 --> 01:06:37.959
because the school was gonna
be closed no matter what.

947
01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:44.799
I downright hated the cardinal
for several years.

948
01:06:46.735 --> 01:06:51.406
I would say that that whole
incident taught me that

949
01:06:51.473 --> 01:06:55.510
the church could manipulate
words and human lives.

950
01:06:57.312 --> 01:07:00.915
<i>But I'm not the only one
that got hurt by an institution.</i>

951
01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:14.874
After we were fired from
the schools. I went to Rome.

952
01:07:14.898 --> 01:07:19.167
<i>to the Vatican. and presented
our case against the cardinal.</i>

953
01:07:22.971 --> 01:07:25.373
[Mary]<i> Other communities</i>
<i>were very supportive.</i>

954
01:07:25.441 --> 01:07:27.486
<i>They were right behind us.</i>

955
01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:31.357
You know. I was mobbed by
various sisters of various communities.

956
01:07:31.381 --> 01:07:33.415
"Tell us. what's the latest?
What's happening?"

957
01:07:37.586 --> 01:07:43.035
And then. in November of 1967.
we were sent notice

958
01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:47.228
<i>from Rome that they were
sending a priest to us.</i>

959
01:07:48.597 --> 01:07:52.000
<i>This priest visited.
His name was Father Gallagher.</i>

960
01:07:52.067 --> 01:07:53.579
<i>And when he came.</i>

961
01:07:53.603 --> 01:07:58.206
we were immediately struck
by his lack of friendliness

962
01:07:58.273 --> 01:08:01.743
and we knew that he was
going to be very critical of us.

963
01:08:04.279 --> 01:08:09.317
<i>After some months. he sent what
became a rather historical document.</i>

964
01:08:10.219 --> 01:08:12.654
<i>the famous Four Points.</i>

965
01:08:24.166 --> 01:08:29.815
<i>This document was shaking.
because it became widely publicized.</i>

966
01:08:29.839 --> 01:08:32.885
<i>It was not just a letter
destined solely for us</i>

967
01:08:32.909 --> 01:08:35.287
<i>as Immaculate Heart sisters.</i>

968
01:08:35.311 --> 01:08:37.579
it was a letter
to the whole United States.

969
01:08:37.646 --> 01:08:39.114
every sister
in the United States.

970
01:08:43.852 --> 01:08:47.922
<i>By order of Rome. these
were the points to be followed.</i>

971
01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:51.493
[woman speaking]

972
01:08:53.529 --> 01:08:57.866
[Anita]<i> It said we had to
follow the same prayer schedule</i>

973
01:08:57.933 --> 01:09:00.335
<i>for everybody at the same time.</i>

974
01:09:06.876 --> 01:09:10.478
<i>In other words. every sister
was to be a teacher.</i>

975
01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:20.421
<i>We were to follow the
regulations of the cardinal.</i>

976
01:09:21.423 --> 01:09:23.658
<i>He was the boss.</i>

977
01:09:26.695 --> 01:09:29.430
Wear a uniform habit.

978
01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:40.375
<i>The sisters were shaken that
an outside force could tell us</i>

979
01:09:40.442 --> 01:09:41.976
<i>what to do.</i>

980
01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:45.157
When the Immaculate Heart
situation occurred.

981
01:09:45.181 --> 01:09:49.851
it was necessary then to set out
guidelines which would influence

982
01:09:49.918 --> 01:09:52.787
the other religious
communities of women.

983
01:09:52.854 --> 01:09:57.192
The Immaculate Heart sisters
really set the tone for a lot

984
01:09:57.259 --> 01:09:59.661
of other nuns. and that
was really the big problem.

985
01:10:00.929 --> 01:10:03.932
Um. because the. um...

986
01:10:03.999 --> 01:10:05.800
You know...

987
01:10:06.569 --> 01:10:08.469
They drifted away from authority

988
01:10:08.537 --> 01:10:09.804
and then you're really
in trouble.

989
01:10:10.739 --> 01:10:12.307
[church bell rings]

990
01:10:17.879 --> 01:10:22.016
[woman]<i> After that. the
cardinal requested from Rome</i>

991
01:10:22.084 --> 01:10:25.397
<i>a team of bishops who
were going to come and see</i>

992
01:10:25.421 --> 01:10:29.324
<i>whether they could convince us
to do what we were told to do.</i>

993
01:10:30.892 --> 01:10:33.539
<i>We were all invited down
to the old convent parlor.</i>

994
01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:35.341
We were all sitting around
the parlor.

995
01:10:35.365 --> 01:10:38.277
<i>There were questions
and answers back and forth.</i>

996
01:10:38.301 --> 01:10:41.436
So. what these bishops
told us to do

997
01:10:41.503 --> 01:10:44.372
was to just really pretend.

998
01:10:46.842 --> 01:10:49.444
<i>To say that we had a habit.
but don't wear it.</i>

999
01:10:49.511 --> 01:10:50.889
<i>Just leave it in the closet.</i>

1000
01:10:50.913 --> 01:10:53.292
<i>Say that we had a uniform
schedule of prayers.</i>

1001
01:10:53.316 --> 01:10:54.515
<i>but don't follow it.</i>

1002
01:10:56.585 --> 01:10:57.719
<i>I mean. why should we lie?</i>

1003
01:10:57.786 --> 01:11:01.422
<i>Why should we pretend
something that wasn't true?</i>

1004
01:11:02.858 --> 01:11:08.630
To suggest those ways of going
about it was just...

1005
01:11:10.132 --> 01:11:11.132
It was just too much.

1006
01:11:14.269 --> 01:11:16.537
[Anita]<i> We said</i>
<i>we did not feel that this</i>

1007
01:11:16.605 --> 01:11:20.208
<i>was in line with the present
way we were thinking.</i>

1008
01:11:20.275 --> 01:11:25.457
so the bishop said that if we
were going to rebel against

1009
01:11:25.481 --> 01:11:27.949
the Four Points
or not follow them

1010
01:11:28.016 --> 01:11:31.719
that we could not
be accounted real sisters.

1011
01:11:33.088 --> 01:11:37.269
<i>That meant that we were
faced with the possibility of</i>

1012
01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:42.163
<i>giving up the vows which we
had pronounced years before.</i>

1013
01:11:45.234 --> 01:11:48.614
[Mary]<i> At that point. Corita
raised her hand and she said.</i>

1014
01:11:48.638 --> 01:11:50.305
<i>"I have one question.</i>

1015
01:11:51.239 --> 01:11:52.740
<i>What would Jesus say?"</i>

1016
01:11:53.776 --> 01:11:55.754
One of them went... [mouths]

1017
01:11:55.778 --> 01:12:00.048
With his mouth and he was
quite taken aback by that.

1018
01:12:02.851 --> 01:12:05.097
They told us. well.
we should make up our minds

1019
01:12:05.121 --> 01:12:09.457
and announce
our decision to Rome.

1020
01:12:26.007 --> 01:12:27.653
[Ann] It was hard.

1021
01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:29.254
They didn't want us to change.

1022
01:12:29.278 --> 01:12:30.678
They didn't want us to change.

1023
01:12:30.746 --> 01:12:34.816
They couldn't figure out why
we are making such a fuss about.

1024
01:12:34.883 --> 01:12:36.617
well. just hang the habit
in the closet.

1025
01:12:36.685 --> 01:12:40.265
But it wasn't just the habit.

1026
01:12:40.289 --> 01:12:42.000
It was a lot of things.

1027
01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:45.537
If you can imagine going
into the classroom and trying

1028
01:12:45.561 --> 01:12:48.429
to teach fifth grade science
when you have no idea

1029
01:12:48.497 --> 01:12:51.165
what the fifth-grade science.
except what the book tells you.

1030
01:12:51.233 --> 01:12:56.571
- [all chuckling] - And we just
felt that we were doing something

1031
01:12:56.638 --> 01:12:59.574
that we believed in
for the good of our community

1032
01:12:59.641 --> 01:13:01.553
and for the good of the church.

1033
01:13:01.577 --> 01:13:06.024
We relished the whole idea of.
if we are going to move ahead.

1034
01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:07.315
we are moving ahead.

1035
01:13:07.382 --> 01:13:10.162
We are not gonna be
old-fashioned nuns anymore.

1036
01:13:10.186 --> 01:13:13.165
And once you start changing...

1037
01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:15.100
you don't put the genie
back in the bottle.

1038
01:13:15.124 --> 01:13:16.702
You can't go back.

1039
01:13:16.726 --> 01:13:18.126
- [woman 1] Yes.
- [woman 2] Yes.

1040
01:13:31.473 --> 01:13:35.053
You know. we fought
for three years. in the press.

1041
01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:37.589
in Rome. everywhere we could.

1042
01:13:37.613 --> 01:13:40.325
<i>And then the decision came
down. you either have to obey</i>

1043
01:13:40.349 --> 01:13:42.683
<i>the cardinal
or you cannot be nuns.</i>

1044
01:13:47.689 --> 01:13:49.668
We had a huge meeting.

1045
01:13:49.692 --> 01:13:53.739
TV cameras were outside
and newspaper reporters.

1046
01:13:53.763 --> 01:13:56.431
One of the crucial disputes
over modernization

1047
01:13:56.498 --> 01:13:58.232
of the Catholic Church
has centered here

1048
01:13:58.300 --> 01:14:01.302
<i>at the Immaculate Heart
convent in Hollywood.</i>

1049
01:14:01.369 --> 01:14:05.006
They nuns will now be polled
to see how they will divide up.

1050
01:14:08.444 --> 01:14:10.778
Sister Eileen got up and cried.

1051
01:14:10.846 --> 01:14:13.158
She could cry very easily.

1052
01:14:13.182 --> 01:14:16.317
And she cried and said
something like.

1053
01:14:16.384 --> 01:14:19.787
<i>"There are many sisters
who want to stay with me"</i>

1054
01:14:19.855 --> 01:14:22.924
<i>and want to have the kind
of religious life</i>

1055
01:14:22.991 --> 01:14:24.659
<i>"they entered the community for."</i>

1056
01:14:28.864 --> 01:14:31.632
<i>And then. I remember
Anita herself</i>

1057
01:14:32.267 --> 01:14:33.835
<i>at that meeting said...</i>

1058
01:14:35.537 --> 01:14:39.207
"This decision has come
to us as a community."

1059
01:14:39.274 --> 01:14:43.455
What that means in the
plan of God. I do not know.

1060
01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:46.325
[woman]<i> I have felt for some</i>
<i>time that the IHMs</i>

1061
01:14:46.349 --> 01:14:51.997
<i>are being asked to read the
signs of the times. to forge ahead.</i>

1062
01:14:52.021 --> 01:14:56.090
<i>to begin with enthusiasm to
work at a community of hope.</i>

1063
01:14:57.626 --> 01:14:59.605
<i>It is possible that such a group</i>

1064
01:14:59.629 --> 01:15:02.697
<i>will have to ask for
dispensation from public vows.</i>

1065
01:15:02.764 --> 01:15:08.280
<i>Our decrees pledge us to an
unending search for personhood.</i>

1066
01:15:08.304 --> 01:15:13.374
<i>vigilant and constant concern with
the destructive forces in our society.</i>

1067
01:15:13.441 --> 01:15:15.643
<i>a willingness
to welcome diversity.</i>

1068
01:15:15.710 --> 01:15:18.846
<i>not merely to tolerate it.
and a condemnation</i>

1069
01:15:18.914 --> 01:15:22.884
<i>with the clarity of Christ of
the primary evil. hypocrisy.</i>

1070
01:15:23.852 --> 01:15:26.254
<i>especially religious hypocrisy.</i>

1071
01:15:27.522 --> 01:15:29.657
<i>With confidence and peace...</i>

1072
01:15:29.724 --> 01:15:32.971
I will carry out
what I think is my duty.

1073
01:15:32.995 --> 01:15:36.397
<i>"It's up to you to make a
conscientious personal decision."</i>

1074
01:15:44.272 --> 01:15:48.854
They sent out a paper
and you had.

1075
01:15:48.878 --> 01:15:52.480
I don't know. maybe two or
three weeks to make up your mind

1076
01:15:52.547 --> 01:15:53.915
before you sent
the paper back in.

1077
01:15:57.352 --> 01:15:59.186
<i>It was not an easy decision.</i>

1078
01:16:01.156 --> 01:16:04.202
<i>It wasn't change
I objected to. but.</i>

1079
01:16:04.226 --> 01:16:09.397
I knew it was a choice between
having vows and not having vows.

1080
01:16:10.098 --> 01:16:14.212
And I wanted to live

1081
01:16:14.236 --> 01:16:17.538
<i>a vow of life.
so I did not sign.</i>

1082
01:16:20.442 --> 01:16:23.444
<i>Some of them said they believed
everything that we were doing.</i>

1083
01:16:23.511 --> 01:16:26.047
<i>but they couldn't bring
themselves to sign the paper.</i>

1084
01:16:26.648 --> 01:16:27.748
And...

1085
01:16:30.919 --> 01:16:33.154
That was really very moving.

1086
01:16:39.194 --> 01:16:42.129
<i>This was a community
that I'd given my life to.</i>

1087
01:16:42.197 --> 01:16:43.976
it was the work
I'd given my life to.

1088
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.766
and I saw it breaking apart.

1089
01:16:48.937 --> 01:16:52.306
<i>I had friends who simply
left around that time.</i>

1090
01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:56.054
<i>I remember walking down
the driveway</i>

1091
01:16:56.078 --> 01:17:00.748
and we were all talking about
what was going to happen

1092
01:17:00.815 --> 01:17:06.454
<i>and Corita said to me that she
was going on a sabbatical in Boston.</i>

1093
01:17:07.289 --> 01:17:09.123
[man speaking]

1094
01:17:23.838 --> 01:17:26.841
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Okay. yeah.

1095
01:17:26.908 --> 01:17:29.877
- Um...
<i>- I was shocked when Corita didn't come back.</i>

1096
01:17:32.981 --> 01:17:35.483
[man]<i> She left not only the
order. she left the church.</i>

1097
01:17:36.584 --> 01:17:39.854
She was scandalized by
what had gone on

1098
01:17:39.921 --> 01:17:41.789
and what was done to her
and the others.

1099
01:17:46.662 --> 01:17:51.065
I think she really thought that the
church did not deserve our devotion.

1100
01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:59.140
We did take vows. poverty.
chastity. and obedience.

1101
01:18:00.876 --> 01:18:06.591
<i>But there came a point
where conscience said...</i>

1102
01:18:06.615 --> 01:18:12.853
we will not be dictated to or
shaped by a power that oppresses.

1103
01:18:16.291 --> 01:18:19.493
[woman]<i> I heard someone
comment about us earlier. and by us.</i>

1104
01:18:19.561 --> 01:18:23.698
<i>I mean the sisters. but it wasn't
so important that we survived.</i>

1105
01:18:23.765 --> 01:18:25.766
<i>but that we should
survive with style.</i>

1106
01:18:27.102 --> 01:18:28.703
<i>And that if you
couldn't do it with style.</i>

1107
01:18:28.770 --> 01:18:30.771
<i>it would be better
not to survive.</i>

1108
01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:40.381
[Patrice]<i> I remember sitting</i>
<i>at the table</i>

1109
01:18:40.448 --> 01:18:44.852
<i>and. um. reading it
over and over.</i>

1110
01:18:44.919 --> 01:18:48.923
<i>And I kept saying.
"Hey. I've got to sign this.</i>

1111
01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:50.758
[chuckles]<i> This is it."</i>

1112
01:18:51.326 --> 01:18:52.904
You know?

1113
01:18:52.928 --> 01:18:57.698
And yet. you know. how sad
that this has to happen.

1114
01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.601
but I signed it.

1115
01:19:25.026 --> 01:19:27.428
Should I address you
as Sister Kelley.

1116
01:19:27.495 --> 01:19:29.274
or President Kelley today?

1117
01:19:29.298 --> 01:19:32.566
Well. Sister Kelley is
appropriate I think. still.

1118
01:19:32.634 --> 01:19:34.746
How do you think the
Roman Catholic community

1119
01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:36.670
in Los Angeles
will react to this?

1120
01:19:37.305 --> 01:19:38.750
Mixed.

1121
01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:41.753
I think. a number of lay Catholics
would like it to stay the way it was.

1122
01:19:41.777 --> 01:19:44.756
Everything else is moving.
why can't the sisters at least

1123
01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:48.449
stand still and give us
some indication of stability?

1124
01:19:48.516 --> 01:19:51.485
Well. I do think that's
the way to be stable anymore.

1125
01:19:53.455 --> 01:19:55.790
[Mary]<i> We didn't know how</i>
<i>many sisters would sign</i>

Nearly the whole community
dispensed from their vows

to still form a new community.

1134

that's happening in the world

1324
01:35:06.534 --> 01:35:08.813
is the fact that we're realizing

1325
01:35:08.837 --> 01:35:11.404
more deeply that awful things
are happening in the world.

1326
01:35:12.573 --> 01:35:14.641
<i>Because we all know
what happens to things</i>

1327
01:35:14.708 --> 01:35:16.843
<i>that are buried under the rug.</i>

1328
01:35:16.910 --> 01:35:20.280
They don't just stay there.
they get worse.

1329
01:35:23.984 --> 01:35:27.765
[Patrice]<i> I get teary-eyed</i>
<i>just thinking about recent</i>

1330
01:35:27.789 --> 01:35:30.423
<i>awful things that happened.</i>

1331
01:35:33.393 --> 01:35:38.398
I remember I burst into tears
when I was watching it on the TV.

1332
01:35:40.534 --> 01:35:43.169
<i>And that just brought back
a lot of memories.</i>

1333
01:35:45.873 --> 01:35:51.878
<i>And I kept saying.
"God. it hasn't changed much."</i>

1334
01:35:54.849 --> 01:35:58.518
<i>But when you bring the
horrible things up to view.</i>

1335
01:36:01.088 --> 01:36:04.591
<i>then you have people who say.
"Let's do something about it."</i>

1336
01:36:05.826 --> 01:36:07.360
<i>And they start to do it."</i>

1337
01:36:10.097 --> 01:36:13.032
[Pat]<i> It's not just a gender</i>
<i>issue for me.</i>

1338
01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:18.149
because I see
the interconnection between

1339
01:36:18.173 --> 01:36:22.153
sexism. racism. ageism.

1340
01:36:22.177 --> 01:36:25.311
<i>homophobia. colonialism.</i>

1341
01:36:25.379 --> 01:36:29.816
<i>All of those forms
of domination are interlinked.</i>

1342
01:36:33.654 --> 01:36:36.122
<i>If our survival is
to be truly stylish.</i>

1343
01:36:36.190 --> 01:36:38.358
<i>the cautions are to
be interjected.</i>

1344
01:36:39.927 --> 01:36:42.506
<i>It is a plea for protest
not without anger.</i>

1345
01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:44.998
<i>but without hatred or contempt.</i>

1346
01:36:47.267 --> 01:36:49.647
<i>Protest exercised
through ridicule.</i>

1347
01:36:49.671 --> 01:36:51.938
<i>no matter how effective.
seems to me</i>

1348
01:36:52.005 --> 01:36:54.774
<i>to be sowing the seeds
of backlash and new hatred.</i>

1349
01:36:58.078 --> 01:37:00.947
<i>Here. at least. today at least.</i>

1350
01:37:01.014 --> 01:37:05.396
<i>our protests ought to be
celebrated in joy.</i>

1351
01:37:05.420 --> 01:37:09.656
<i>Such protest with joy has the power
to transform all who are party to it.</i>

1352
01:37:13.828 --> 01:37:18.498
It was the genesis of an egalitarian
spirit that moved these women.

1353
01:37:19.834 --> 01:37:21.701
<i>It's easier to see that now.</i>

1354
01:37:24.738 --> 01:37:26.573
<i>If you fit in.
you are not a prophet.</i>

1355
01:37:34.348 --> 01:37:35.682
They didn't fit in.

[Helen]<i> The passion</i>
