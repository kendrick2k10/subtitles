00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:43.625
[birds chirping]

00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:56.708
-[man laughing]
-[indistinct chatter]

6
00:00:56.791 --> 00:00:58.416
[woman] Okay. Tell me what you're tasting.

7
00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:02.625
[man] Cherry. raspberry.

8
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:05.291
and what is that?

9
00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:07.291
[cutlery clinking]

10
00:01:07.375 --> 00:01:08.583
Spice and tobacco.

11
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.708
-Exactly. You nailed it.
-Ah.

12
00:01:10.791 --> 00:01:13.083
It's a red burgundy. but to me.

13
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:15.125
it's a passport to a travel experience.

14
00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:19.416
You know. I'm suddenly transported
to a chateau garden outside of Dijon

15
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.791
on a warm Autumn day.

16
00:01:20.875 --> 00:01:22.708
[both chuckling lightly]

17
00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:24.125
Smart of you to fly up.

18
00:01:24.208 --> 00:01:26.416
Mythos Wines was almost off my list.

19
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.250
Speaking of. I'm so sorry
the previous wine rep went MIA.

20
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:31.333
I will personally handle
your account from now on.

21
00:01:31.416 --> 00:01:32.875
Good. Stay for lunch.

22
00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:35.291
Hand-torn pasta with porcini and herbs.

23
00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:37.833
Oh. You're evil. I wish.

24
00:01:37.916 --> 00:01:41.666
I have to catch a flight
back to L.A. in… oh. now.

25
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.375
When are you gonna stop
racing around California 24/7.

26
00:01:45.458 --> 00:01:46.916
putting out fires for your boss?

27
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.541
Ugh. Calder's not that bad.

28
00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:50.833
[scoffing] Okay. Yeah. he is.

29
00:01:50.916 --> 00:01:53.833
He's terrible. but I'm angling
for Regional Sales Director.

30
00:01:53.916 --> 00:01:56.666
I would like to see
Lola Alvarez running her own show.

31
00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.416
with her own wine import company.

32
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.208
So. just got back from my Sydney house.

33
00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:04.125
[Lola] Uh-huh.

34
00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:08.625
Tried some new wines by Hazel Vaughn.

35
00:02:08.708 --> 00:02:11.083
-Oh. Hamish. no. not another--
-[Hamish] I know. I know.

36
00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:14.000
Another Fortune 500 CEO
with a vanity wine label.

37
00:02:14.916 --> 00:02:16.083
Just try it.

38
00:02:17.791 --> 00:02:20.833
It's a pétillant naturel wine.

39
00:02:20.916 --> 00:02:22.291
The ancient technique.

40
00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:23.208
[Lola] Ooh.

41
00:02:23.291 --> 00:02:25.208
Bubbles before it's bottled.

42
00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:27.833
Mm-hmm. Hazel doesn't have a US importer.

43
00:02:28.916 --> 00:02:32.041
If you get Mythos a contract
for Vaughn Wines.

44
00:02:32.125 --> 00:02:36.125
I'd put it on my list
for all of my restaurants.

45
00:02:36.625 --> 00:02:39.708
[Lola] Well. if Ms. Vaughn's office
isn't available. I'll leave word.

46
00:02:39.791 --> 00:02:41.166
Okay. Are you ready?

47
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.041
-310-555-0143.
-[indistinct chatter]

48
00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:46.458
[whispering] Thanks. Okay.

49
00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:49.208
-Hi. Oh…
-First-Class souvenir.

50
00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:51.541
-I am so jealous of your life.
-[Lola chuckling]

51
00:02:51.625 --> 00:02:53.791
I just ate lunch from the vending machine.

52
00:02:54.291 --> 00:02:55.666
He's on a tear today.

53
00:02:56.166 --> 00:02:57.791
He even made the FedEx lady cry.

54
00:02:57.875 --> 00:02:59.458
Ramona? Who makes Ramona cry?

55
00:02:59.541 --> 00:03:01.541
I know. I've been on the phone
with Kroger all day.

56
00:03:01.625 --> 00:03:04.000
They stocked our Lone Elk Merlot
on the bottom shelf.

57
00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:07.250
Okay. Nobody looks at the grocery store
bottom shelf. Eye-level only.

58
00:03:07.333 --> 00:03:08.375
I got creative.

59
00:03:08.458 --> 00:03:12.541
I traded them a multi-case discount
on Pink Lady Rosé for a better facing.

60
00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:14.208
Daryl from Kroger was all over it.

61
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:16.041
I'm pretty sure
he thought it was his idea.

62
00:03:16.125 --> 00:03:18.166
Nice work. girl. Love it.

63
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.708
[woman] I took a page
out of the Lola playbook.

64
00:03:20.791 --> 00:03:22.791
[woman chattering indistinctly]

65
00:03:24.875 --> 00:03:26.875
[woman] Remember we love our jobs.

66
00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:30.750
May I remind you
this is a place of business.

67
00:03:30.833 --> 00:03:32.375
not a Chuck E. Cheese?

68
00:03:32.458 --> 00:03:33.666
Oh. [chuckling lightly]

69
00:03:35.708 --> 00:03:36.583
[grunts]

70
00:03:38.333 --> 00:03:40.625
Lola. update me on the King account.

71
00:03:40.708 --> 00:03:44.166
Saved it. And our Burgundy was
successfully added to his wine list.

72
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.833
You know me. go big or go home.

73
00:03:45.916 --> 00:03:47.500
That's why you're my number one.

74
00:03:47.583 --> 00:03:49.916
-If only everyone was as motivated.
-[balloon popping]

75
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.291
[struggling]

76
00:03:52.375 --> 00:03:53.500
-[balloon pops]
-[woman 2] Ow!

77
00:03:53.583 --> 00:03:56.208
I want new ideas at the town hall
tomorrow. No resting on laurels.

78
00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:58.791
Oh. no. I know. I hate laurels. Ugh.

79
00:03:58.875 --> 00:04:00.083
Oh. I'm actually gonna be late.

80
00:04:00.166 --> 00:04:01.958
I finally scored a sit-down
with Wine Barn.

81
00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:05.708
Fine. Just. uh. don't pitch me any
of that all-female Uruguayan

82
00:04:05.791 --> 00:04:07.291
wine collective nonsense again.

83
00:04:07.375 --> 00:04:08.750
I know it's small batch.

84
00:04:08.833 --> 00:04:10.541
but it's these
really incredible women who--

85
00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:13.625
I'm in the wine business.
not the whining business.

86
00:04:13.708 --> 00:04:14.916
[woman] Oh… [chuckling]

87
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.333
[chuckling nervously]

88
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.958
He's gonna fire me.
I can feel it. [clears throat]

89
00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:23.625
-Okay. okay. Deep breaths. Here we go.
-[woman breathing heavily]

90
00:04:23.708 --> 00:04:27.041
[exhaling slowly] Okay. you have an entire
night to find something to pitch.

91
00:04:27.125 --> 00:04:28.583
-[woman] Yeah. Okay.
-Don't worry.

92
00:04:28.666 --> 00:04:30.291
-[cell phone ringing]
-Oh. uh. one second.

93
00:04:30.375 --> 00:04:31.208
[woman] Okay.

94
00:04:33.375 --> 00:04:34.458
Lola Alvarez.

95
00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:35.875
[phones ringing]

96
00:04:37.583 --> 00:04:38.458
A month?

97
00:04:39.333 --> 00:04:42.125
Well. can I schedule a meeting
for when Ms. Vaughn returns?

98
00:04:43.291 --> 00:04:45.625
Yeah. I'll send over materials. Okay.

99
00:04:45.708 --> 00:04:47.750
Great. Sounds good. Speak soon. Thanks.

100
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.333
[whispering] Yes.

101
00:04:49.416 --> 00:04:50.250
That sounded big.

102
00:04:51.125 --> 00:04:52.958
-[Lola chuckling]
-[woman] What's up?

103
00:04:53.041 --> 00:04:53.916
Oh…

104
00:04:55.166 --> 00:04:58.000
Oh. Come on. work wife. Spill. [chuckling]

105
00:04:58.083 --> 00:05:01.291
Okay. Vaughn Family Wines.
Out of Australia.

106
00:05:01.375 --> 00:05:04.125
Started as a celebrity label
made at a custom crush facility.

107
00:05:04.208 --> 00:05:08.166
But now Hazel Vaughn has her own vineyards
and brought in an award-winning winemaker.

108
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.083
What? Sweet find. [chuckling]

109
00:05:11.166 --> 00:05:12.625
Uh. how… how can I help?

110
00:05:12.708 --> 00:05:14.708
Right now.
Hazel's on sabbatical for a month.

111
00:05:14.791 --> 00:05:17.333
so just keep this between you and I
until I get a meeting set.

112
00:05:17.416 --> 00:05:18.500
Okay. [chuckling]

113
00:05:18.583 --> 00:05:20.666
Thanks. Gotta run.

114
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.416
One last client drop-in until I'm facedown
on my couch in sweatpants.

115
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.583
[mouthing]

116
00:05:25.666 --> 00:05:27.666
[contemplative music playing]

117
00:05:31.375 --> 00:05:33.541
-[man laughing loudly]
-[indistinct chatter]

118
00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.791
[all laughing]

119
00:05:37.875 --> 00:05:38.708
That's good.

120
00:05:42.125 --> 00:05:43.625
Get on in here.

121
00:05:43.708 --> 00:05:46.083
Made pizzas from scratch.
We got leftovers.

122
00:05:46.166 --> 00:05:47.208
[Lola] Hey. Dad.

123
00:05:51.541 --> 00:05:53.250
Hello.

124
00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.625
So. what is the neighborhood book club
pretending to discuss this month?

125
00:05:57.708 --> 00:06:02.458
[laughing] Oh. honey. You know we only
walk over to Carlos's for the free rosé.

126
00:06:02.541 --> 00:06:04.750
Mm. And we are loving this one.

127
00:06:04.833 --> 00:06:06.833
Oh. I can see. You guys work fast.

128
00:06:06.916 --> 00:06:09.500
Mm. Deep gratitude for the wine hookup.

129
00:06:09.583 --> 00:06:12.458
Mm. Speaking of hookups. spill.

130
00:06:13.166 --> 00:06:14.291
Oh. [sighing heavily]

131
00:06:14.375 --> 00:06:17.041
[woman] Come on.
we've already finished the other gossip.

132
00:06:17.125 --> 00:06:17.958
Here we go.

133
00:06:18.041 --> 00:06:21.416
Can't you just discuss my love life
behind my back. like normal people?

134
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.708
-Uh. no.
-[Carlos] No.

135
00:06:22.791 --> 00:06:24.333
-[woman] We can't do that.
-No.

136
00:06:24.416 --> 00:06:25.958
Not our style. No.

137
00:06:26.041 --> 00:06:27.791
How long since that divorce. Lola?

138
00:06:27.875 --> 00:06:29.666
Um. two years.

139
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.375
Why? Who's counting?

140
00:06:31.458 --> 00:06:32.833
-Me.
-[Lola sighing]

141
00:06:32.916 --> 00:06:34.708
Grandkids don't make themselves.

142
00:06:34.791 --> 00:06:36.541
Oh. Dad. really? What?

143
00:06:36.625 --> 00:06:39.208
-Honestly we're gonna go there tonight?
-[woman laughing]

144
00:06:39.291 --> 00:06:40.375
[sirens wailing]

145
00:06:40.458 --> 00:06:43.333
Sweetie. while not subtle.
book club has a point.

146
00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.875
Tyler let a damn good thing go.

147
00:06:46.458 --> 00:06:47.958
It's time to move on. like he did.

148
00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:51.458
Tyler didn't turn out to be the person
that I thought he was. Okay?

149
00:06:52.125 --> 00:06:53.791
Not every man is a liar.

150
00:06:54.375 --> 00:06:56.083
Look at me. I'm perfect.

151
00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:57.333
[Lola scoffing]

152
00:06:57.416 --> 00:06:59.750
You always see the best in people.
Don't stop now.

153
00:06:59.833 --> 00:07:00.791
[scoffing]

154
00:07:00.875 --> 00:07:03.416
Your heart got broken.
you pressed pause on your love life.

155
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.708
It's time to press play.

156
00:07:05.208 --> 00:07:07.333
You got to learn to trust again.

157
00:07:09.875 --> 00:07:14.500
I project a year-over-year increase
in sales. placing these wines in…

158
00:07:14.583 --> 00:07:16.416
-[Lola] Excuse me.
-…upscale restaurants…

159
00:07:17.083 --> 00:07:19.625
-Hi.
-[woman] …and specialty bottle shops.

160
00:07:19.708 --> 00:07:23.208
Plus. the Australian government
offers a substantial financial package.

161
00:07:23.291 --> 00:07:24.750
um. to export.

162
00:07:24.833 --> 00:07:26.708
so it's a win-win.

163
00:07:26.791 --> 00:07:27.875
[melancholy music playing]

164
00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.333
In summation. Calder.

165
00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.833
I have secured you a pitch meeting
four weeks from today

166
00:07:32.916 --> 00:07:35.500
with Hazel Vaughn herself.

167
00:07:35.583 --> 00:07:36.458
[clearing throat]

168
00:07:36.541 --> 00:07:37.666
[Lola scoffing]

169
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.708
Hmm. You got a passport. Audra?

170
00:07:39.791 --> 00:07:41.250
Mm-hmm. Yep.

171
00:07:41.333 --> 00:07:42.833
You're coming to Sydney with me.

172
00:07:43.416 --> 00:07:45.875
Close this deal.
we're talking Regional Sales Director.

173
00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.166
-Oh.
-[cell phone ringing]

174
00:07:48.166 --> 00:07:50.833
Uh. short break. everybody.
I gotta take this.

175
00:07:53.416 --> 00:07:54.583
[breathing heavily]

176
00:07:55.416 --> 00:07:56.541
I… I didn't…

177
00:07:58.458 --> 00:08:01.333
Sugar-pops. I got the opera tickets.

178
00:08:02.125 --> 00:08:03.416
[chuckling] Okay. ciao.

179
00:08:04.541 --> 00:08:06.208
Vaughn Family Wines is my find.

180
00:08:06.291 --> 00:08:08.291
Well. Audra pitched it and now it's hers.

181
00:08:08.375 --> 00:08:10.125
Okay. only because I told her about it.

182
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:12.875
Well. that was
your big mistake now. Wasn't it?

183
00:08:13.541 --> 00:08:15.666
We learn lessons the hard way. Lola.

184
00:08:18.791 --> 00:08:19.708
[Lola sighing]

185
00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:23.291
Lola's up next. everybody. Let's go.

186
00:08:23.375 --> 00:08:25.375
[indistinct chatter]

187
00:08:25.458 --> 00:08:27.333
[man clearing throat. sighing]

188
00:08:28.625 --> 00:08:29.916
[Calder] This should be good.

189
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.833
[Calder clearing throat]

190
00:08:33.666 --> 00:08:34.541
[Lola sighing]

191
00:08:35.125 --> 00:08:35.958
Hmm?

192
00:08:36.583 --> 00:08:37.500
[inhaling sharply]

193
00:08:37.583 --> 00:08:40.541
You know. it's no secret you're not
the most warm and fuzzy boss. Calder.

194
00:08:40.625 --> 00:08:42.291
[employees murmuring]

195
00:08:42.375 --> 00:08:45.125
But hey. I get it.
You know. wine is a tough business.

196
00:08:45.208 --> 00:08:48.000
and I told myself you were setting
a high bar for good reason.

197
00:08:48.083 --> 00:08:51.958
But nope. turns out
you are a garden-variety snob.

198
00:08:52.041 --> 00:08:54.375
-You mistake cruelty for cleverness.
-[employees gasping]

199
00:08:54.458 --> 00:08:57.583
When it comes to wine. you barely know
a Petit Verdot from a Petit Syrah.

200
00:08:57.666 --> 00:08:59.000
You're not fooling anyone.

201
00:08:59.083 --> 00:09:00.458
Don't be emotional. Lola.

202
00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:03.416
If this is about
the Regional Sales Director position--

203
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.166
[chuckling] Audra can have it.
I've been saving your butt for years.

204
00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:07.083
I'm done!

205
00:09:07.708 --> 00:09:09.375
[muttering] What are you doing?

206
00:09:09.458 --> 00:09:11.958
Oh. isn't it obvious? I'm quitting.

207
00:09:12.041 --> 00:09:13.416
[Calder laughing]

208
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.625
Uh. no. you can't leave.
I decide when someone leaves.

209
00:09:16.708 --> 00:09:19.916
Oh. Not today. pal. You fall straight
into the category of "life is too short."

210
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.875
You know what? I would rather sell
margaritas in a can at a suburban 7-Eleven

211
00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.500
than work another minute for you.

212
00:09:25.583 --> 00:09:27.041
[employees murmuring]

213
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.583
Bye. hon. Good luck finding
someone else's ideas to steal.

214
00:09:33.041 --> 00:09:33.916
Take care. team.

215
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.875
Oh. and. uh. I have a stash of Girl Scout
cookies in my bottom desk drawer.

216
00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.791
so parting gift. [clicking tongue]

217
00:09:38.875 --> 00:09:41.041

-[mouthing] Bye.

221
00:09:46.458 --> 00:09:47.791
-Morning.
-Morning.

222
00:09:47.875 --> 00:09:50.333
Oh. Who knew quitting
would be so inspiring?

223
00:09:50.416 --> 00:09:53.750
[inhales deeply] And terrifying.
It's a really interesting combo.

224
00:09:53.833 --> 00:09:55.291
-[laughing]
-[exhaling sharply] Okay.

225
00:09:55.375 --> 00:09:58.916
How is this for my new company logo?

226
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.625
-[man] Wow.
-I sketched it last night.

227
00:10:02.208 --> 00:10:03.541
-[Dad] I love it.
-[Lola] Really?

228
00:10:03.625 --> 00:10:06.375
It's barely day one of your own company
and you're already crushing it?

229
00:10:06.458 --> 00:10:08.166
I'm proud of you. sweetie. It's time.

230
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:09.208
Use a coaster.

231
00:10:09.291 --> 00:10:10.125
Thanks. Dad.

232
00:10:10.208 --> 00:10:12.625
But so far my company
is just an elaborate doodle

233
00:10:12.708 --> 00:10:14.666
and some lovely Uruguayan ladies.

234
00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:18.750
And with my savings on the line.
I really need a big account ASAP.

235
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.750
I need Vaughn Family Wines.

236
00:10:22.833 --> 00:10:23.875
Uh-oh.

237
00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.625
I know this tone of voice.

238
00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:27.708
Hold on to your butts. everyone.

239
00:10:27.791 --> 00:10:28.625
[keyboard clacking]

240
00:10:28.708 --> 00:10:30.416
-Calder's meeting's in four weeks.
-[Dad] Mm.

241
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.833
I did some Internet sleuthing.
That sabbatical Hazel's on?

242
00:10:32.916 --> 00:10:35.708
She spends every year
at her family's sheep farm in Australia.

243
00:10:35.791 --> 00:10:38.000
Like a "stay in touch
with her roots" kinda thing.

244
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.166
Hazel Vaughn's farm also…

245
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:41.208
[keyboard clacking

246
00:10:41.291 --> 00:10:43.041
…has an Airbnb cottage.

247
00:10:44.125 --> 00:10:47.416
Yeah. I'll rent the cottage.
and pitch my company to Hazel first.

248
00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.666
Boom. It's a matter of principle now.

249
00:10:50.166 --> 00:10:52.416
Wow. Australia!

250
00:10:52.916 --> 00:10:54.375
That sounds kind of

251
00:10:55.375 --> 00:10:56.208
far.

252
00:10:56.291 --> 00:10:57.541
Yeah. I know.

253
00:10:57.625 --> 00:10:59.291
Gah. Is this too bold?

254
00:10:59.375 --> 00:11:02.458
I don't know. like.
am I brave or just. like. really crazy?

255
00:11:03.041 --> 00:11:05.666
-[Lola sighing heavily]
-Is your gut telling you to do this?

256
00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:07.625
Yes.

257
00:11:08.208 --> 00:11:09.791
Strangely. it just…

258
00:11:10.625 --> 00:11:12.291
It feels right to me.

["Traveling Song" by Timber Bones playing]

260
00:11:14.208 --> 00:11:18.750
Then I say. let's go a lot of bold
and a little crazy.

261
00:11:19.833 --> 00:11:20.791
[yelling happily]

262
00:11:21.291 --> 00:11:24.333

Well. good morning. Australia. Hi.

266

I'm all good now.

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:32.375
And time to go.

Hi.

288
00:13:47.666 --> 00:13:51.666
Can I help you find something?
Combination to the safe maybe.

289
00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:54.083
Yes. De-- No! No. no. no. no.

290
00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:56.208
No. I'm sorry. No combination needed.

291
00:13:56.291 --> 00:13:57.666
That will not be necessary.

292
00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:59.833
Hi. I. um… I… I booked the Airbnb.

293
00:13:59.916 --> 00:14:02.875
Yeah. I figured.
I've been expecting you. Just not here.

294
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:04.375
Oh. Weird.

295
00:14:04.458 --> 00:14:07.291
So you're saying that this isn't
the cottage that I rented. huh?

296
00:14:07.375 --> 00:14:08.666
Whoo. Imagine that. [laughing]

297
00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:11.958
All right. If there's nothing else
on your "breaking and entering" agenda.

298
00:14:12.041 --> 00:14:14.708
let me show you
to your slightly more modest lodging

299
00:14:14.791 --> 00:14:16.166
before the boss gets home. okay?

300
00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:18.958
Oh. wait. If by boss
you mean Hazel Vaughn.

301
00:14:19.041 --> 00:14:21.708
could you. um. help a girl get introduced?

302
00:14:22.333 --> 00:14:26.000
Uh. right. That's why
you're snooping around her house.

303

-Um. not snooping. Sure.
-[man] Come on. Let's go.

to score face time with the Hazel Vaughn.

Come on. Please?

Look. enjoy the cottage.
Take some selfies with the sheep.

308
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.958
Just don't bother Hazel Vaughn.

[man 2] Excuse me. Mate. we got issues.

310
00:14:45.458 --> 00:14:46.375
Miss.

311
00:14:46.458 --> 00:14:49.291
That new jackaroo Peter? He's just quit.

312
00:14:49.375 --> 00:14:50.208
Done.

313
00:14:50.291 --> 00:14:52.791
[sighing heavily] It's not like
that bludger did any work.

314
00:14:52.875 --> 00:14:55.291
I always had to send him off
to sober up under a tree.

315
00:14:55.375 --> 00:14:58.291
Oh. but I saw that guy.
He took my airport van to the pub.

316
00:14:58.375 --> 00:15:00.708
[man 2 chuckling] That sounds about right.

317
00:15:00.791 --> 00:15:03.791
I've been calling everywhere.
No one has any workers to spare.

318
00:15:03.875 --> 00:15:07.958
Not even a bloody backpacker.
Anyway. gotta get back to the sheep.

319
00:15:08.458 --> 00:15:09.291
Righto.

00:15:11.041 --> 00:15:12.458

00:15:12.541 --> 00:15:14.083
Let's get you situated. right?

323
00:15:27.458 --> 00:15:29.000
[man] Hey. Stop.

324
00:15:30.708 --> 00:15:33.083
Hi. Hi. Lola Alvarez.

325
00:15:33.166 --> 00:15:35.958
I am very excited
about your wine. Ms. Vaughn.

326
00:15:36.041 --> 00:15:38.541
And since you're only considering
American importers personally.

327
00:15:38.625 --> 00:15:42.166
I figured a self-made lady boss would
appreciate another self-made lady boss--

328
00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:44.083
-Sorry. Hazel. She's--
-Not done talking.

329
00:15:44.666 --> 00:15:46.291
My company. Salud Imports.

330
00:15:46.375 --> 00:15:48.583
is a newly established
California importer--

331
00:15:48.666 --> 00:15:50.916
I've never heard of them. How new?

332
00:15:51.583 --> 00:15:54.916
So far. it's only me. and I'm still
in the process of getting licensed.

333
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.750
-Doesn't that take months?
-[Lola] 60 days.

334
00:15:56.833 --> 00:16:00.208
And I can also guarantee placement
with the world-famous chef Hamish King.

335
00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:02.375
Whoa. Let me stop you right there.

336
00:16:02.458 --> 00:16:04.666
Despite the ambush. I admire your moxie.

337
00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:06.500
And Hamish King
is an impressive name-drop.

338
00:16:06.583 --> 00:16:08.416
so I'll be just as straight
with you in return.

339
00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.750
You've clearly done your research.

340
00:16:10.833 --> 00:16:12.708
Vaughn Family Wines is my baby.

341
00:16:12.791 --> 00:16:16.458
so there is absolutely no way
I will go with a first-time importer.

342
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:18.916
Sorry you wasted an airline flight.

343
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.458
Yeah. look. while I got ya. bad news.

344
00:16:21.541 --> 00:16:23.000
Jackaroo bailed on us today.

345
00:16:23.083 --> 00:16:25.875
-[Hazel] It's shearing season.
-[man] Yeah. Same as neighboring stations.

346
00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:28.208
-Everyone's shorthanded.
-Well. I… I could do it.

347
00:16:30.208 --> 00:16:31.083
Could do what?

348
00:16:31.166 --> 00:16:33.875
The job. I mean. how long
do you need someone? A few days?

349
00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:36.000
About two weeks. Also. no.

350
00:16:36.083 --> 00:16:39.083
Well. why not? I'm here and I'm willing.
I can be your jackaroo.

351
00:16:39.916 --> 00:16:42.166
Yeah. nah. You'd. uh… you'd be a jillaroo.

352
00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:43.791
Gendered terms. Cute. Whatever works.

353
00:16:43.875 --> 00:16:46.291
Look. we need someone
with real station experience.

354
00:16:46.375 --> 00:16:47.916
not an Airbnb tourist.

355
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.666
Look. I came all this way
to show Ms. Vaughn I go the extra mile.

356
00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:53.750
This is the extra mile.

357
00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:56.875
I'm a hard worker.
And I will hit the ground running.

358
00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:59.458
just as I will
when I'm working with your wine.

359
00:17:00.583 --> 00:17:01.500
[inhaling deeply]

360
00:17:01.583 --> 00:17:04.875
Well. a pair of hands is a pair of hands.

361
00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.125
If Max here agrees.

362
00:17:06.208 --> 00:17:09.833
He's this station's boss cocky.
so what he says. goes.

363
00:17:09.916 --> 00:17:12.875
You will never have to send me off
to sober up under a tree.

364
00:17:13.375 --> 00:17:14.375
I pay attention.

365
00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:16.333
[birds chirping]

366
00:17:18.333 --> 00:17:21.166
[scoffing] I can't believe
it's come to this.

367
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:23.875
-[Hazel] Looks like your lucky day.
-[grunts happily]

368
00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:26.916
And since my sabbatical
always includes endless work calls.

369
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.166
Max here will be in charge of training you

370
00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:31.666
starting today.

371
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:32.791
Today?

372
00:17:33.375 --> 00:17:35.958
No. I can't spend the next two weeks
babysitting some newbie.

373
00:17:36.041 --> 00:17:37.916
[Hazel] That's busy farm life for you.

374
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.458
-Yeah. Tim can do it.
-The person I trust is you.

375
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:46.916
[scoffing]

376
00:17:47.708 --> 00:17:49.208
I hope you're worth the trouble.

377
00:17:49.791 --> 00:17:52.208
Lola Alvarez. give us all you've got.

378
00:17:52.916 --> 00:17:56.125
If you pass muster at mustering.
then we can talk wine.

379
00:17:57.291 --> 00:17:58.291
Deal.

380
00:17:58.875 --> 00:17:59.708
Thank you.

381
00:18:01.041 --> 00:18:01.916
[whispering] Yes.

382
00:18:04.208 --> 00:18:05.291
[exhaling sharply]

383
00:18:05.375 --> 00:18:06.541
[sighing heavily]

384
00:18:06.625 --> 00:18:08.000
Might as well get started then.

385
00:18:08.875 --> 00:18:09.750
[upbeat music playing]

386
00:18:09.833 --> 00:18:12.541
-Wait. like. right now?
-No time like the present.

387
00:18:12.625 --> 00:18:15.291
Well. I mean. Don't I need
to drop my bag off at the cottage first?

388
00:18:15.375 --> 00:18:18.500
Leave it. And no more cottage.
Workers stay in the shearers' quarters.

389
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.333
Well. I… I mean. I can't just leave
my bag here. What if it gets stolen?

390
00:18:22.416 --> 00:18:24.708
We're 200 kilometers away from anything.

391
00:18:24.791 --> 00:18:25.958
Who's gonna steal it?

392
00:18:26.458 --> 00:18:28.750
Wait. What? Uh…

393
00:18:28.833 --> 00:18:30.958
[sheep bleating]

394
00:18:31.041 --> 00:18:33.000
[Max] Sheep pens. Shearing shed.

395
00:18:33.083 --> 00:18:35.958
When you're running livestock.
you wanna make sure they're safe.

396
00:18:36.041 --> 00:18:38.125
fed. you know. watered.

397
00:18:38.208 --> 00:18:40.333
Keep up on diseases and pregnancies.

398
00:18:40.416 --> 00:18:43.375
Sounds like things get pretty wild here
on a Saturday night.

399
00:18:43.458 --> 00:18:44.291
[Lola chuckling]

400
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:45.833
Yeah.

401
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.041
[Lola grunting]

402
00:18:54.833 --> 00:18:58.375
[Max] Uh. so. during the season.
we shear about 500 sheep a day.

403
00:18:58.458 --> 00:19:01.500
Ah. Okay.
So that's where the action happens.

404
00:19:01.583 --> 00:19:02.416
Uh. yeah. nah.

405
00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:05.875
You won't be doing any sheep work.
That's for the experienced hands.

406
00:19:06.375 --> 00:19:08.166
Okay. So. what will I be doing?

407
00:19:08.916 --> 00:19:11.500
Chores. Grunt work. Hard yakka.

408
00:19:12.541 --> 00:19:14.208
Hey. you volunteered for it.

409
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:17.041
Not complaining. I love grunt work.

410
00:19:17.125 --> 00:19:18.750
Whoo! Bring it on.

411
00:19:18.833 --> 00:19:20.041
That's good to hear.

412
00:19:20.708 --> 00:19:22.875
We'll start you off
with some fence mending.

413
00:19:24.791 --> 00:19:27.791
We have kangaroos out here.
constantly making holes.

414
00:19:28.291 --> 00:19:32.250
Kangaroos? Like. boing-boing ones
with pouches? Will I get to see some?

415
00:19:32.333 --> 00:19:35.708
Yeah. That "boing-boing one"
will kick you flat on your back.

416
00:19:35.791 --> 00:19:37.125
What about koalas?

417
00:19:37.208 --> 00:19:38.333
Uh. they scratch.

418
00:19:38.416 --> 00:19:40.416
Huge claws. like this.

419
00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.416
Oh. So disappointing.

420
00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.291
Do you have to burst every bubble?

421
00:19:44.375 --> 00:19:46.250
-[engine sputtering]
-[Max] Maybe.

422
00:19:46.833 --> 00:19:48.166
[engine rattling]

423
00:19:49.958 --> 00:19:52.250
[Max] Hey. don't-- Lazza. don't.

424
00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:55.625
-Lazza. don't keep--
-[Lola] Oh. [chuckles]

425
00:19:55.708 --> 00:19:58.458
[groaning] Lazza.
don't quit on me here. Come on.

426
00:19:59.708 --> 00:20:01.416
[engine backfires. dies]

427
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.041
[keys turning]

428
00:20:04.125 --> 00:20:05.000
[steam hissing]

429
00:20:07.791 --> 00:20:10.000
Busted radiator. Gotta walk back.

430
00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.166
Wait. Can't you call a tow truck?

431
00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:14.833
[chuckles] Yeah. nah.
There's no reception out here.

432
00:20:14.916 --> 00:20:16.375
Oh. great. [scoffing]

433
00:20:16.458 --> 00:20:18.208
Station life is unpredictable.

434
00:20:18.708 --> 00:20:21.958
As they say. "If you jump
in the saddle. be ready for the ride."

435
00:20:22.458 --> 00:20:25.166
-Was that a cowboy wisdom quote?
-Stockman. No cowboys here.

436
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:26.291
Then what's a jackaroo?

437
00:20:26.375 --> 00:20:27.416
[Max chuckling]

438
00:20:28.125 --> 00:20:31.333
Well. it's technically a cowboy.
but it's a term for newbies like you.

439
00:20:31.416 --> 00:20:33.583
-Are they all you got?
-My ankle boots?

440
00:20:33.666 --> 00:20:35.125
Uh. um…

441
00:20:35.708 --> 00:20:37.708
-Oh. I have sneakers too.
-Oh. that's no good.

442
00:20:38.208 --> 00:20:39.791
-Flip-flops?
-It's rough land out here.

443
00:20:39.875 --> 00:20:42.000
You'll need Blunnies to protect your feet.

444
00:20:42.666 --> 00:20:44.208
And you didn't even bring a hat.

445
00:20:44.291 --> 00:20:46.041
It was kinda supposed
to be a two-night stay.

446
00:20:46.125 --> 00:20:47.458
-Right.
-You guys got a gift shop?

447
00:20:47.541 --> 00:20:49.291
[chuckling] That's very funny.

448
00:20:49.375 --> 00:20:51.083
-Here. Take mine. [laughing]
-Oh! No. no. no.

449
00:20:51.166 --> 00:20:53.666
Okay. Oh. right.

450
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:55.041
Well. then. thank you.

451
00:20:55.125 --> 00:20:57.000
This is… This is fine. I'm fine.

452
00:20:57.083 --> 00:20:58.875
[Max] Well. you won't be in an hour or so.

453
00:20:58.958 --> 00:21:01.041
Australian sun shows no mercy.

454
00:21:01.541 --> 00:21:03.166
We'll start back training tomorrow.

455
00:21:03.666 --> 00:21:05.666
[Lola] This is gonna be fun. [chuckling]

456
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:08.041
[peaceful music playing]

457
00:21:08.125 --> 00:21:08.958
[Lola] What?

458
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.250
[Max] Sixty days. huh?

459
00:21:12.083 --> 00:21:15.375
-[Lola] To get my wine importer's license?
-[Max] I pay attention.

460
00:21:15.916 --> 00:21:16.875
[Lola] Huh.

461
00:21:16.958 --> 00:21:20.666
Yeah. There's no way Hazel's gonna go
for a company that doesn't exist yet.

462
00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:23.125
You do realize how absurd that is. right?

463
00:21:24.083 --> 00:21:26.208
Well. sometimes you have to take risks.

464
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.041
Believe in yourself.

465
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.416
You know. go big or go home.

466
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.291
Yeah. Well. good on ya.

467
00:21:33.833 --> 00:21:35.416
But I wouldn't get my hopes up.

468
00:21:36.291 --> 00:21:39.166
Okay. Well.
thank you for the encouragement.

469
00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:40.666
I'm just being practical.

470
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:42.666
Practical isn't really my style.

471
00:21:43.875 --> 00:21:45.000
[exhaling sharply]

472
00:21:45.666 --> 00:21:47.625
Is it always so hot here?

473
00:21:47.708 --> 00:21:48.541
Nah.

474
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.541
Gets heaps hotter in the arvo.

475
00:21:53.416 --> 00:21:55.541
-Arvo?
-[Max] Means "afternoon."

476
00:21:56.083 --> 00:21:57.583
[indistinct chatter]

477
00:21:57.666 --> 00:21:59.083
[dog barking]

478
00:21:59.166 --> 00:22:01.416
[keyboard clacking]

479
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.750
[indistinct clamoring]

480
00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:06.458
[woman] Who's the one
who lives in the van?

481
00:22:06.541 --> 00:22:08.791
[woman 2] No.
The blonde one from last Saturday.

482
00:22:08.875 --> 00:22:09.708
[woman 2 chuckling]

483
00:22:09.791 --> 00:22:12.583
[woman 2] He's the only shaggable man
within 200 kilometers.

484
00:22:12.666 --> 00:22:14.333
[woman] This is why I'm glad
I'm not single.

485
00:22:14.416 --> 00:22:15.708
Hi. Lola from L.A.

486
00:22:15.791 --> 00:22:17.875
Your new roomie. [chuckling]

487
00:22:17.958 --> 00:22:18.916
Hi.

488
00:22:24.041 --> 00:22:25.958
Oh. impromptu mobile office.

489

[all chuckling]

490
00:22:31.375 --> 00:22:33.083
I got a Skype-date with Heidi.

491
00:22:33.166 --> 00:22:35.416
Yeah. Lockie hasn't messaged
me back since Tuesday.

492
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.291
He's definitely ghosting me.

493
00:22:37.375 --> 00:22:38.750
Ugh. men.

494
00:22:38.833 --> 00:22:39.791
[chuckling]

495
00:22:39.875 --> 00:22:42.541
I'm Breeze. And don't worry about them.

496
00:22:43.125 --> 00:22:45.166
Takes a while to earn their trust.

497
00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:49.291
Oh. Yeah. I'm only here for two weeks.
I'm not trying to steal their jobs. so…

498
00:22:49.375 --> 00:22:51.458
Reckon that airport van'll
be back here in no time.

499
00:22:51.541 --> 00:22:53.333
Bet you ten bucks
she doesn't last the week.

500
00:22:53.416 --> 00:22:54.958
-[chuckles] Deal.
-[shower knob squeaks]

501
00:22:55.666 --> 00:22:56.500

-Oh!

504
00:22:59.958 --> 00:23:02.625
[man] Oh no!
Somebody used all the hot water!

505
00:23:02.708 --> 00:23:04.708
-What? Are you kidding?
-Are you serious?

506
00:23:04.791 --> 00:23:09.250
Sorry. It was a 14-hour flight.
I really needed that long shower.

507
00:23:09.333 --> 00:23:12.083
-[scoffing]
-Heidi. Hi. baby.

508
00:23:12.166 --> 00:23:13.875

Well. that is just brilliant.

1551
01:10:25.083 --> 01:10:29.125
Hmm. I'd actually been consulting
with a rival winery.

1552
01:10:29.208 --> 01:10:32.875
Then Hazel lured me away
when she expanded Vaughn Family Wines.

1553
01:10:32.958 --> 01:10:37.208
Oh. I can see why. It's amazing here.
And you said all the wines are organic?

1554
01:10:37.291 --> 01:10:39.416
-Yes. And biodynamic.
-Wow.

1555
01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:41.541
No chemicals. no manipulations.

1556
01:10:41.625 --> 01:10:42.500
just grapes.

1557
01:10:43.791 --> 01:10:46.458
-So. my specialty is blends.
-[Lola] Hmm.

1558
01:10:46.541 --> 01:10:50.375
Vaughn Family Wines have really unique
flavor profiles found nowhere else.

1559
01:10:50.458 --> 01:10:53.541
The varietals both complement
and contrast in the glass.

1560
01:10:53.625 --> 01:10:55.291
-[Felix] Mm-hmm.
-Hmm. Okay.

1561
01:10:55.375 --> 01:10:57.041
I'll get you to try this.

1562
01:10:57.125 --> 01:10:58.541
This is a Shiraz blend

1563
01:10:58.625 --> 01:11:00.916
from the cooler climate
of the Yarra Valley.

1564
01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.583
Oh. Mm.

1565
01:11:02.666 --> 01:11:04.208
[sniffing] Okay.

1566
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.250
Oh.

1567
01:11:10.333 --> 01:11:13.041
It's like I'm in a rustic mountain cabin.

1568
01:11:13.125 --> 01:11:14.875
warming myself
next to a wood-burning fire.

1569
01:11:14.958 --> 01:11:16.708
cozy under a cashmere blanket.

1570
01:11:16.791 --> 01:11:18.458
Mm. Beautifully put.

1571
01:11:18.541 --> 01:11:21.375
We've also produced a Chardonnay blend
from the same region.

1572
01:11:21.875 --> 01:11:23.458
It's my special reserve.

1573
01:11:23.541 --> 01:11:25.250
Citrus and mineral.

1574
01:11:25.333 --> 01:11:27.250
Ooh. Sign me up for that.

1575
01:11:27.333 --> 01:11:29.583
It's 200 dollars a bottle.

1576
01:11:30.208 --> 01:11:33.250
Um. sign me up
for the email list instead. maybe.

1577
01:11:33.333 --> 01:11:36.166
I could break one open for a wee taste.

1578
01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:37.583
Max?

1579
01:11:38.583 --> 01:11:41.916
Uh. yeah. another time.
Yeah. We still have work to do.

1580
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.250
-Mm. Hmm.
-[Max] Mm-hmm.

1581
01:11:44.333 --> 01:11:46.708
-I'll pack you some wine to-go.
-Cool. thanks.

1582
01:11:48.625 --> 01:11:52.416
So. how does this work?
I mean. you're obviously a regular here.

1583
01:11:53.416 --> 01:11:55.166
I like the way you talk about wine.

1584
01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.708
Yeah. How it transports you.

1585
01:12:00.625 --> 01:12:02.958
Well. I believe that wine
should be a vacation.

1586
01:12:03.041 --> 01:12:04.583
Or should I say holiday?

1587
01:12:04.666 --> 01:12:05.666
[Max chuckling]

1588
01:12:06.416 --> 01:12:07.500
[Lola] Mm.

1589
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:08.916
[glass clinking]

1590
01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:12.291
Is this the official label
for all the Vaughn Family Wines?

1591
01:12:12.375 --> 01:12:15.291
Uh. think so. yeah. Felix would know.

1592
01:12:16.083 --> 01:12:18.083
I wonder why it's called
Vaughn Family Wines.

1593
01:12:18.166 --> 01:12:20.500
I mean. Hazel kinda seems like a solo act.

1594
01:12:20.583 --> 01:12:21.958
[dramatic music playing]

1595
01:12:22.833 --> 01:12:23.791
[Lola] Hmm.

1596
01:12:24.416 --> 01:12:26.625
Where is my notebook?

1597
01:12:26.708 --> 01:12:28.666
This place is giving me ideas.

1598
01:12:30.583 --> 01:12:31.833
[Max sighing]

1599
01:12:36.291 --> 01:12:39.875
[Max] Hey. last night. uh.
you said something at the pub.

1600
01:12:39.958 --> 01:12:41.458
-Oh God. what?
-[Max chuckling]

1601
01:12:41.541 --> 01:12:44.541
-Actually. no. Don't tell me.
-[Max] Nah. it's too late.

1602
01:12:44.625 --> 01:12:47.000
Uh. you said I seem lonely.

1603
01:12:47.625 --> 01:12:48.791
[birds chirping]

1604
01:12:49.291 --> 01:12:50.833
-Yikes.
-[Max] Mm-hmm.

1605
01:12:50.916 --> 01:12:52.958
I guess. uh… [inhales deeply]

1606
01:12:53.041 --> 01:12:55.375
in vino veritas?

1607
01:12:55.458 --> 01:12:56.541
Boozy truth?

1608
01:12:57.291 --> 01:12:58.541
You know. I always chalked it up

1609
01:12:58.625 --> 01:13:01.458
to most women
not liking life out in the bush.

1610
01:13:01.541 --> 01:13:04.625
It's hot. remote. dangerous.

1611
01:13:04.708 --> 01:13:06.750
[scoffing] It is not
for the faint of heart.

1612
01:13:06.833 --> 01:13:12.000
Yeah. but rugged loner is just a way
of making excuses for myself.

1613
01:13:14.291 --> 01:13:17.000
You know. when my mum died.
I promised I'd do better.

1614
01:13:17.083 --> 01:13:20.166
but I've just been playing it safe.

1615
01:13:21.375 --> 01:13:22.291
[chuckling]

1616
01:13:22.375 --> 01:13:23.708
Unlike someone I know.

1617
01:13:25.166 --> 01:13:26.916
Wow. Okay.

1618
01:13:27.458 --> 01:13:30.916
Turns out my drunken babbling
wasn't such a disaster after…

1619
01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.333
[gasping] Oh.

1620
01:13:32.416 --> 01:13:34.041
Kangaroo! A baby kangaroo.

1621
01:13:34.125 --> 01:13:36.625
-[Max sighing] A juvenile.
-[Lola] Baby kangaroo.

1622
01:13:36.708 --> 01:13:39.500
See. I bet its mum made this hole
in the fence. They're everywhere.

1623
01:13:39.583 --> 01:13:42.791
Okay. Can I not just enjoy
this one stereotypical Aussie moment?

1624
01:13:42.875 --> 01:13:44.458
Oh my God. [gasping]

1625
01:13:45.958 --> 01:13:48.500
Are you serious? That is your lock screen?

1626
01:13:48.583 --> 01:13:51.250
Excuse me. sir. This is a private photo
of me and my best friend.

1627
01:13:51.333 --> 01:13:52.791
-[Max] Ugh.
-[gasping]

1628
01:13:53.708 --> 01:13:55.208
-[camera shutter clicking]
-[Lola] Aww.

1629
01:13:55.291 --> 01:13:57.833
Now I just need to see a koala.
You promised.

1630
01:13:57.916 --> 01:13:59.166
I did no such thing.

1631
01:13:59.250 --> 01:14:00.458
-[Lola] Yes. you did.
-Nope.

1632
01:14:00.541 --> 01:14:02.041
Remember the other day?

1633
01:14:02.125 --> 01:14:04.500
-[Max] I don't. 'cause it didn't happen.
-You said it.

1634
01:14:05.291 --> 01:14:06.250
Better make it happen.

1635
01:14:06.333 --> 01:14:08.958
You're making…
You better fix that fence right now.

1636
01:14:09.041 --> 01:14:10.208
[Lola laughing]

1637
01:14:10.291 --> 01:14:11.416
It's so cute.

1638
01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:12.916
[magical music playing]

1639
01:14:22.083 --> 01:14:23.041
[Lola exhaling sharply]

1640
01:14:24.333 --> 01:14:25.625
Wow. [chuckles]

1641
01:14:26.166 --> 01:14:28.625
Australia showing off again.

1642
01:14:32.416 --> 01:14:34.750
Thank you. Australia!

1643
01:14:35.833 --> 01:14:37.208
[both laughing]

1644
01:14:39.375 --> 01:14:40.250
[Lola sighing]

1645
01:14:47.583 --> 01:14:48.500
[Max groaning]

1646
01:14:49.250 --> 01:14:51.166
[Max] What are you scribbling so intently?

1647
01:14:52.166 --> 01:14:54.375
-[Lola] I was inspired by our field trip.
-[Max] Hmm.

1648
01:14:54.458 --> 01:14:57.208
I have new ideas to pitch to Hazel.

1649
01:14:57.291 --> 01:14:58.458
[crickets chirping]

1650
01:15:00.250 --> 01:15:01.541
[Max] Ah. [chuckling]

1651
01:15:02.041 --> 01:15:03.000
Sybylla Vaughn.

1652
01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:05.000
Yep. A new label.

1653
01:15:05.083 --> 01:15:06.875
Every bottle should tell her story.

1654
01:15:08.208 --> 01:15:09.791
[romantic music playing]

1655
01:15:10.375 --> 01:15:12.541
Look. Lola.
the funny thing about Sybylla is--

1656
01:15:12.625 --> 01:15:15.166
Sybylla is what makes Vaughn Family Wines.

1657
01:15:15.250 --> 01:15:17.666
She's the key. I mean.
she can create a personal relationship

1658
01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:19.708
between the winemaker
and the wine drinker.

1659
01:15:19.791 --> 01:15:22.750
Sybylla is an aspirational inspiration
to all.

1660
01:15:27.625 --> 01:15:29.333
That's a really great idea.

1661
01:15:31.125 --> 01:15:32.833
I've been feeling really creative.

1662
01:15:33.333 --> 01:15:35.625
[sighing] I think it's
from my time here at Waratah Station.

1663
01:15:35.708 --> 01:15:39.708
-I don't know how to put it. but--
-It's revived your senses. maybe?

1664
01:15:39.791 --> 01:15:41.000
-Yes!
-Yeah. [chuckling]

1665
01:15:41.083 --> 01:15:42.333
[chuckling] Exactly.

1666
01:15:43.333 --> 01:15:47.791
Air smells fresher.
Food tastes better. I sleep like a log.

1667
01:15:47.875 --> 01:15:51.083
[chuckles] Okay.
Well. I can drink to that.

1668
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:54.875
Wait. is that the…

1669
01:15:54.958 --> 01:15:57.125
is that the 200-dollar bottle
of Chardonnay?

1670
01:15:57.208 --> 01:15:59.541
I had Felix put it on ice.

1671
01:15:59.625 --> 01:16:01.916
You… You said you wanted to try it.

1672
01:16:03.250 --> 01:16:04.333
Just say cheers.

1673
01:16:05.250 --> 01:16:06.083
Okay.

1674
01:16:06.750 --> 01:16:07.583
Salud.

1675
01:16:08.916 --> 01:16:09.833
[Lola chuckles]

1676
01:16:13.041 --> 01:16:14.083
[Max sighing]

1677
01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:15.583
Oh.

1678
01:16:15.666 --> 01:16:16.500
Yeah.

1679
01:16:16.583 --> 01:16:17.958
[Lola laughing]

1680
01:16:18.583 --> 01:16:21.416
And we're also celebrating
sparing your sheep.

1681
01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:23.083
Blah Blah whatever its name is.

1682
01:16:23.166 --> 01:16:24.916
-It won't be Sunday supper. Oh God.
-Baaabra?

1683
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.208
-Yeah. It won't
-Really?

1684
01:16:26.291 --> 01:16:27.291
Yeah. nah.

1685
01:16:27.375 --> 01:16:30.833
Was that more on the "yeah." or the "nah"?
Or just a meaningless "yeah. nah"?

1686
01:16:30.916 --> 01:16:33.041
[laughs] Yeah. nah.
You won me over. All right?

1687
01:16:33.125 --> 01:16:35.208
-Can we put a cute scarf around her neck?
-[Max] No.

1688
01:16:35.291 --> 01:16:38.083
-And a… and a name plaque on her pen?
-Oh my goodness.

1689
01:16:38.166 --> 01:16:39.166
[both laughing]

1690
01:16:39.250 --> 01:16:41.000
-[Max] Settle down.
-Please?

1691
01:16:41.083 --> 01:16:41.916
Nah.

1692
01:16:45.875 --> 01:16:46.916
[Lola] Mm.

1693
01:16:48.583 --> 01:16:50.375
I don't want today to end…

1694
01:16:50.916 --> 01:16:52.291
-[Lola yawning]
-[Max chuckling]

1695
01:16:52.375 --> 01:16:54.583
…but bed is calling my name.

1696
01:16:54.666 --> 01:16:55.916
[Max] Swag check.

1697
01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.500
-[Lola groaning]
-[Max] Hey.

1698
01:16:58.708 --> 01:17:00.166
Oh!

1699
01:17:00.250 --> 01:17:02.083
Oh. it's just a harmless tree snake.

1700
01:17:02.166 --> 01:17:04.333
Likes to warm up in the bedroll. don't ya?

1701
01:17:04.416 --> 01:17:05.375
[breath shuddering]

1702
01:17:05.458 --> 01:17:07.750
Just when I was starting
to like this place.

1703
01:17:07.833 --> 01:17:09.958
There you go. buddy.

1704
01:17:14.333 --> 01:17:15.291
Okay.

1705
01:17:15.833 --> 01:17:16.833
[breathing shakily]

1706
01:17:16.916 --> 01:17:17.958
[Max chuckling]

1707
01:17:18.041 --> 01:17:20.166
-Wow. [chuckles nervously]
-[Max] It's all good.

1708
01:17:20.250 --> 01:17:22.500
-Whatever you say.
-Whatever I say.

1709
01:17:22.583 --> 01:17:23.875
[Lola sighing]

1710
01:17:23.958 --> 01:17:24.833
[Max grunting]

1711
01:17:24.916 --> 01:17:26.916
Oh. okay. Hello?

1712
01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.375
-[Max] You all right? [laughs]
-[laughing] Yeah.

1713
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:30.875
Oh.

1714
01:17:31.416 --> 01:17:33.541
The stars are amazing here.

1715
01:17:34.166 --> 01:17:35.250
[Lola sighing]

1716
01:17:35.333 --> 01:17:38.583
That's Alpha Centauri there.

1717
01:17:39.541 --> 01:17:42.541
and. uh. that's the Southern Cross.

1718
01:17:44.458 --> 01:17:45.291
Hey.

1719
01:17:46.375 --> 01:17:47.958
What if that snake comes back?

1720
01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:57.625
We will have safety in numbers.

1721
01:18:04.833 --> 01:18:06.125

how you worked for him for years.

and how devastated he was that you decided
to strike out on your own.

you went to to get this account.

to visit the winery.

draw up the contracts.

01:26:41.208 --> 01:26:43.083
[gasping] Before I forget.

1891
01:26:45.625 --> 01:26:48.041
-Returning the loaners.
-Thank you.

1892
01:26:48.541 --> 01:26:50.750
-Aw. Perfect condition.
-For you.

1893
01:26:50.833 --> 01:26:51.875
How did you do that?

1894
01:26:51.958 --> 01:26:54.250
I. um… I cleaned them.

1895
01:26:54.333 --> 01:26:55.750
-That checks out. yeah.
-Right. Yeah.

1896
01:26:55.833 --> 01:26:56.666
[Sam] Yeah.

1897
01:26:57.625 --> 01:26:58.541
One more thing.

1898
01:27:01.041 --> 01:27:03.208
-[gasping] Ooh. ooh. What is this?
-Oh. Okay.

1899
01:27:03.291 --> 01:27:05.250
-Open it.
-What is it?

1900
01:27:05.333 --> 01:27:07.000
It's a… it's a FLATOUTbear.

1901
01:27:07.083 --> 01:27:10.083
I've never really heard of them.
but it's… it's a thing here.

1902
01:27:10.166 --> 01:27:11.000
Yeah.

1903
01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:15.791
And I love it.

1904
01:27:15.875 --> 01:27:18.291
My. uh… My dad's my best friend.

1905
01:27:18.375 --> 01:27:21.083
He's got a lot of opinions
about a lot of things. but I love it.

1906
01:27:21.166 --> 01:27:22.250
And. um…

1907
01:27:22.333 --> 01:27:24.708
and I know
you're gonna be amazing too. so…

[Sam sighing]

1909
01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:27.708
[Lola] Aw.

1910
01:27:29.375 --> 01:27:31.541

-We'll see you later. Yup. see ya.
-Yeah.

1916

[Sam] Ooh.

1917
01:27:54.583 --> 01:27:56.083
So. all that to just…

1918
01:27:58.083 --> 01:27:59.083
To walk away?

1919
01:28:00.083 --> 01:28:01.500
Staying true to myself.

1920
01:28:02.541 --> 01:28:04.083
I'll figure it out. [inhales deeply]

and neither do I.

1923
01:28:12.041 --> 01:28:13.375
Look. about us. I just--

1924
01:28:13.458 --> 01:28:14.791
There is no us. Okay?

1925
01:28:16.416 --> 01:28:18.916
I'm a Yank career gal
heading home to the big smoke

1926
01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.750
and you're here
doing your undercover boss thing.

1927
01:28:22.833 --> 01:28:23.666
It would…

1928
01:28:24.333 --> 01:28:25.333
It would never work.

1929
01:28:27.083 --> 01:28:28.375
And for the record.

1930
01:28:28.875 --> 01:28:31.125
I never cared what your last name was.

1931
01:28:32.916 --> 01:28:34.125
I never even asked.

01:28:39.625 --> 01:28:40.458
No. uh.

1935
01:28:43.458 --> 01:28:44.375
Nah.

01:28:48.625 --> 01:28:49.541

Goodbye. Max Vaughn.

1939

1942
01:29:23.166 --> 01:29:26.583
Why doesn't your company buy
its own darn coffee machine?

1943
01:29:26.666 --> 01:29:30.125
Oh please. Dad.
you love being unofficial officer manager.

1944
01:29:30.208 --> 01:29:32.250
-Hmm. Use a coaster.
-Okay.

1945
01:29:32.333 --> 01:29:34.666
-Refill. Audra?
-Oh. Yes. please.

1946
01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:36.750
You know.
when you rented that nice apartment. Lola.

1947
01:29:36.833 --> 01:29:39.916
I was hoping to turn this
into a yoga studio.

1948
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.166
Dad. when have you ever done yoga?

1949
01:29:42.250 --> 01:29:46.208
Uh. I was voted
most flexible Latino in high school.

1950

1952
01:29:49.041 --> 01:29:50.541
I still got some tricks.

-Wow.
-Namaste.

[both laugh]

1955
01:29:54.375 --> 01:29:58.041
I wonder if. um. Hazel's gonna end up
going with the Sybylla wine label.

1956
01:29:59.208 --> 01:30:01.541
Yeah. Like. speaking of.

1957
01:30:02.041 --> 01:30:04.291
it's all over the wine trade websites.

1958
01:30:04.375 --> 01:30:05.291
[Lola] Hmm?

1959
01:30:05.375 --> 01:30:07.833
Mythos and Vaughn Family Wines
have parted ways.

1960
01:30:09.333 --> 01:30:10.416
-Wow.
-[Audra] Yeah.

1961
01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:11.416
That was quick.

1962
01:30:11.916 --> 01:30:15.083
[Audra] Yeah. Like. still in
the contractual grace period. apparently.

1963
01:30:15.166 --> 01:30:18.541
Um. the official reason is
they had. like. different working styles.

1964
01:30:18.625 --> 01:30:20.000
but you know.

1965
01:30:20.083 --> 01:30:22.208
I mean. AKA.
they got to know Calder better. right?

1966
01:30:22.291 --> 01:30:23.125
[Lola] Ugh.

1967
01:30:23.791 --> 01:30:27.791
So. like. should…
should we go after Vaughn Wines?

1968
01:30:27.875 --> 01:30:29.375
I mean. it was your idea.

1969
01:30:30.416 --> 01:30:31.833
Let's focus on new business.

1970
01:30:32.541 --> 01:30:34.583
Have you even tried calling Max?

1971
01:30:34.666 --> 01:30:35.541
[scoffing]

1972
01:30:36.291 --> 01:30:37.125
No.

1973
01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.458
Look. it took me a while
to figure this out.

1974
01:30:40.541 --> 01:30:44.000
but it's not even
that he lied. you know? I…

1975
01:30:44.916 --> 01:30:46.000
[exhaling sharply]

1976
01:30:46.083 --> 01:30:49.250
I don't know. I just…
I don't think he knows who he is yet.

1977
01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:55.708
Sure. but what if his way
to change that was to share it

1978
01:30:55.791 --> 01:30:59.375
with someone he really trusted.
and that was you?

1979
01:30:59.458 --> 01:31:00.958
[dramatic music playing]

1980
01:31:01.458 --> 01:31:02.291
[scoffing]

1981
01:31:02.791 --> 01:31:04.458
So when did you get so wise?

1982
01:31:05.333 --> 01:31:07.541
Since you gave me a second chance.

1983
01:31:10.125 --> 01:31:11.833
You see the best in people. Lola.

1984
01:31:12.666 --> 01:31:14.291
Even when they don't deserve it.

1985
01:31:14.875 --> 01:31:17.958
You believing in them
makes them want to be that best version.

1986
01:31:20.041 --> 01:31:20.875
Yeah.

1987
01:31:22.083 --> 01:31:23.125
I just. uh…

1988
01:31:24.125 --> 01:31:27.291
When we said goodbye.
he didn't step up for me.

1989
01:31:28.583 --> 01:31:31.208
So. in Max's Pinterest wisdom.

1990
01:31:31.291 --> 01:31:34.125
the horse is already out of the barn.

1991
01:31:41.333 --> 01:31:43.958
Well. actually. Uruguay
is a rising star in the wine world.

1992
01:31:44.041 --> 01:31:47.125
Its mild maritime climate is ideal
for grape growing.

1993

And the women
of the wine collective we're representing

1994
01:31:49.833 --> 01:31:51.208
are known for their red varietals.

1995
01:31:51.291 --> 01:31:54.125

is through the roof.

what Vaughn Family Wines needs.

2032
01:33:33.958 --> 01:33:34.791
I did.
