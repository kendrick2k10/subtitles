3
00:03:54.656 --> 00:03:57.427
Lookin' good. Sarah.
You make that
look too easy.

4
00:03:57.526 --> 00:04:00.130
Thanks. Chad. Hey.
I got somethin' for you.

5
00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.697
No shit!

6
00:04:01.798 --> 00:04:04.868
This got ripped
off my helmet
on a skydive yesterday.

7
00:04:04.968 --> 00:04:05.802
And survived!

8
00:04:05.902 --> 00:04:07.770
I just found it
in the landing area.

9
00:04:07.871 --> 00:04:10.340
- You're welcome.
- Thanks.

10
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.308
That was a pretty
sick landing. Sarah.

11
00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:14.310
Thanks.

12
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:17.213
- Did you enjoy your solo?
- I did.

13
00:04:17.313 --> 00:04:20.083
You know. you'd have
a lot more fun
jumping with us.

14
00:04:20.582 --> 00:04:21.918
So you keep telling me.

15
00:04:22.718 --> 00:04:23.920
Just 'cause you're
the new girl

16
00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.655
doesn't mean
you can't make friends.

17
00:04:26.755 --> 00:04:28.224
You should come out
with us some time.

18
00:04:29.392 --> 00:04:30.726
Is that
your way of asking?

19
00:04:30.827 --> 00:04:33.997
Well. yeah.
I'm not not-asking.

20
00:04:34.097 --> 00:04:35.664
Wow.

21
00:04:35.764 --> 00:04:38.201
I can't say I've ever
heard that line before.

22
00:04:39.502 --> 00:04:41.137
You're not gonna make
this easy on me.

23
00:04:41.237 --> 00:04:42.906
Where's the fun in that?

24
00:04:44.541 --> 00:04:47.709
- You mind if I leave this
here for Kris?
- Yeah. no doubt.

25
00:04:53.416 --> 00:04:54.716
That was classic.

26
00:04:54.818 --> 00:04:57.854
I've never seen Payson
get shut down before.

27
00:04:57.954 --> 00:05:00.857
I don't think it's ever
happened. to be honest.

28
00:05:00.957 --> 00:05:04.194
Just another
cocky Skygod.

29
00:05:04.294 --> 00:05:06.129
Every drop zone has one.

30
00:05:08.131 --> 00:05:09.799
You done
with that packing weight?

31
00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:11.301
Um. yup.

32
00:05:16.672 --> 00:05:18.374
Who was that?

33
00:05:18.475 --> 00:05:19.708
That's Kris.

34
00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:22.412
He's been packing
parachutes
a long time.

35
00:05:22.512 --> 00:05:24.646
- Does he jump?
- Used to.

36
00:05:24.746 --> 00:05:27.951
They say he was
pretty bad-ass
back in the day.

37
00:05:28.051 --> 00:05:30.253
Guess he decided to quit
while he was ahead.

38
00:05:30.353 --> 00:05:32.555
<i>Load 5. gear up.</i>
<i>You're on five-minute call.</i>

39
00:05:32.654 --> 00:05:33.923
<i>Load 5.</i>

40
00:05:34.723 --> 00:05:38.727
Dude. give it up.
It's never gonna happen.

41
00:05:39.728 --> 00:05:41.998
I'm with Wade.
She's never gonna
come around.

42
00:05:42.465 --> 00:05:45.135
You've been trying
to get her to jump with us
since she got here.

43
00:05:45.235 --> 00:05:47.403
What's so special
about her. anyway?

44
00:05:47.504 --> 00:05:48.905
You don't know
who that is?

45
00:05:50.106 --> 00:05:52.142
Skydiving runs
in that girl's blood.

46
00:05:52.242 --> 00:05:55.311
We need a sixth. Lisa.
And she's the one.

47
00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:59.415
Whatever.

48
00:06:17.766 --> 00:06:20.937
- Payson!
- Sorry. sorry.

49
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:24.407
- I have
a confession to make.
- Oh?

50
00:06:24.507 --> 00:06:27.877
Since when do they
allow women
into the priesthood?

51
00:06:27.977 --> 00:06:29.646
I need something from you.

52
00:06:29.745 --> 00:06:30.947
I just know talent
when I see it.

53
00:06:31.047 --> 00:06:33.917
and right now.
the team could use you.

54
00:06:35.385 --> 00:06:37.921
You ever heard of the phrase.
"I don't want to belong
to any club

55
00:06:38.021 --> 00:06:40.156
that would have me
as a member?"

56
00:06:40.256 --> 00:06:43.493
Yeah. Groucho Marx.

57
00:06:43.593 --> 00:06:46.362
You get points
for knowing that.

58
00:06:46.462 --> 00:06:48.798
Doesn't change the fact
that I like to jump alone.

59
00:06:55.371 --> 00:06:57.907
Jumping alone is
kind of like masturbating.

60
00:06:58.007 --> 00:07:01.678
It'll do in a pinch.
but it's kinda depressing.

61
00:07:01.777 --> 00:07:03.913
Maybe you don't
masturbate right.

62
00:07:13.456 --> 00:07:15.124
Mm-hmm?

63
00:07:15.225 --> 00:07:17.093
A group of us are going
to church later.

64
00:07:17.427 --> 00:07:18.995
You ever been?

65
00:07:19.095 --> 00:07:21.197
What self-respecting girl
hasn't been to church
a few times?

66
00:07:21.864 --> 00:07:23.299
So I'll see you there?

67
00:07:24.434 --> 00:07:26.970
I'll say... maybe.

68
00:07:41.317 --> 00:07:42.185
They missed you.

69
00:07:44.354 --> 00:07:46.022
They're just ducks. Mom.

70
00:07:47.991 --> 00:07:49.259
They don't miss me.

71
00:07:52.595 --> 00:07:53.830
You like it?

72
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:55.865
It's a new blend
I've been working on.

73
00:07:57.567 --> 00:07:58.901
Yeah.

74
00:07:59.002 --> 00:08:03.772
It's like a mix
between tree bark
and peat moss.

75
00:08:03.873 --> 00:08:05.774
It's healthy.
Just drink it.

76
00:08:13.616 --> 00:08:15.151
It's good
to have you back.

77
00:08:16.452 --> 00:08:18.054
It's good
to be back...

78
00:08:19.188 --> 00:08:20.456
I think.

79
00:08:23.192 --> 00:08:25.995
I was hoping
we could fix things.

80
00:08:27.897 --> 00:08:29.565
I would like that.

81
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.904
Look. before you left.
I let my emotions
get the best of me.

82
00:08:37.373 --> 00:08:39.609
I was angry.

83
00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:41.177
I hope you can
understand that.

84
00:08:48.451 --> 00:08:49.585
Are you still jumping?

85
00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.188
We're talking
about fixing things.

86
00:08:52.288 --> 00:08:54.390
and that's where
you want to go?

87
00:08:56.192 --> 00:08:58.728
I'm staying safe.
Mom. don't worry.

88
00:08:58.828 --> 00:09:00.129
What I worry about

89
00:09:00.229 --> 00:09:03.099
is you moving
from place to place.
all by yourself.

90
00:09:03.199 --> 00:09:06.135
You don't stick around
in one place long enough
to make any friends.

91
00:09:06.235 --> 00:09:09.138
I got invited to hang out
with some people tonight.

92
00:09:09.238 --> 00:09:12.442
Well. good.
I hope you're gonna go.

93
00:09:12.542 --> 00:09:14.110
I haven't decided.

94
00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:17.947
Sarah...
you should go.

95
00:09:18.881 --> 00:09:20.483
You need it.

96
00:09:59.122 --> 00:10:01.224
There she is.

97
00:10:02.191 --> 00:10:03.993
Ah. shit.
Thanks a lot.

98
00:10:04.093 --> 00:10:05.595
Guess that means
I'm going first.

99
00:10:05.695 --> 00:10:07.263
Nice to meet you. too.

100
00:10:07.363 --> 00:10:09.399
That's Greg. He bet me
you wouldn't show.

101
00:10:09.499 --> 00:10:12.335
I think he's got
a little crush.

102
00:10:12.435 --> 00:10:13.903
That's Evan.

103
00:10:14.003 --> 00:10:15.138
- Yo.
- Hey.

104
00:10:15.238 --> 00:10:17.173
- Wade. Lisa.
- 'Sup.

105
00:10:18.608 --> 00:10:20.009
What is she
doing here?

106
00:10:20.109 --> 00:10:23.579
Come on. Lisa.
church is for everyone.

107
00:10:23.679 --> 00:10:26.149
Yeah. I still don't get
why they call this church.

108
00:10:26.249 --> 00:10:27.750
'Cause this is where you go
to pray for your life.

109
00:10:27.851 --> 00:10:30.286
Damn. dude.
that's dark.

110
00:10:32.021 --> 00:10:33.990
Welcome
to church. Sarah.

111
00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:36.559
- Yeah!
- Whoo!
He cheats death again.

112
00:10:36.659 --> 00:10:37.693
Whoo-whoo.

113
00:10:39.228 --> 00:10:41.030
So. uh. I hear
you might be joining us

114
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:44.167
for some formation jumps
tomorrow.

115
00:10:44.267 --> 00:10:45.501
I don't know about that.

116
00:10:45.601 --> 00:10:47.503
I've never done
any formation jumps before.

117
00:10:47.603 --> 00:10:48.638
What?

118
00:10:48.738 --> 00:10:50.406
What do you do
when you skydive?

119
00:10:50.506 --> 00:10:52.375
What. do you just play
"Princess of the Sky"

120
00:10:52.475 --> 00:10:54.010
up there all by yourself?

121
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:56.814
I guess I've just always
kept to myself.

122
00:10:56.914 --> 00:10:58.114
I like it that way.

123
00:10:58.214 --> 00:11:00.483
I wonder if other people
like it that way. too.

124
00:11:01.885 --> 00:11:03.786
So. listen. uh.

125
00:11:03.887 --> 00:11:06.924
now that we finally
have six people...

126
00:11:07.023 --> 00:11:08.691
I think we should
try "The Hex."

127
00:11:12.094 --> 00:11:14.063
You guys gonna jump
or what?

128
00:11:15.231 --> 00:11:18.334
That seems like a bad idea.
but what do I know?

129
00:11:18.434 --> 00:11:19.702
Let's go. Wade.

130
00:11:20.736 --> 00:11:22.004
See ya.

131
00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:25.876
Bombs away.

132
00:11:26.008 --> 00:11:27.443
Whoo!

133
00:11:29.745 --> 00:11:32.381
Go. go. go!

134
00:11:32.482 --> 00:11:35.017
- Ooo!
-  - Hurry up and land. Wade.

135
00:11:35.117 --> 00:11:37.353
Coming in hot. Lisa.

136
00:11:42.793 --> 00:11:44.327
So. hey...

137
00:11:45.995 --> 00:11:48.331
- The Hex?
- Yeah.

138
00:11:49.867 --> 00:11:51.300
For real?
I mean. come on.

139
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.536
I'd expect this
from Wade. but not you.

140
00:11:54.805 --> 00:11:56.472
It's just--

141
00:11:56.572 --> 00:11:59.475
I mean. we've all
heard the stories.

142
00:11:59.575 --> 00:12:02.745
I mean. you believe every story
you hear at the drop zone?

143
00:12:02.846 --> 00:12:04.714
Hey. trust me.

144
00:12:04.815 --> 00:12:07.016
Have I ever
steered you wrong?

145
00:12:10.553 --> 00:12:11.787
Okay.

146
00:12:21.731 --> 00:12:23.432
Have a good jump. Sarah.

147
00:12:23.533 --> 00:12:24.667
Thanks.

148
00:12:33.877 --> 00:12:35.411
Whoo.

149
00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:38.314
Whoo!

150
00:12:38.414 --> 00:12:41.317
Listen. I didn't mean
to assume anything.

151
00:12:41.417 --> 00:12:43.954
I know you haven't agreed
to jump with us.

152
00:12:44.053 --> 00:12:47.657
And I'm sorry I said
jumping alone was lame.

153
00:12:47.757 --> 00:12:49.058
Uh. it's okay.

154
00:12:49.158 --> 00:12:51.795
I'm sorry I questioned
your masturbating skills.

155
00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:57.333
So. what's the Hex?

156
00:12:57.433 --> 00:13:00.003
It's this jump
I've always wanted to do.

157
00:13:00.102 --> 00:13:02.071
but you need six people.

158
00:13:02.171 --> 00:13:04.307
- Six talented people.
- Ah.

159
00:13:05.241 --> 00:13:06.843
What do you say?

160
00:13:12.315 --> 00:13:14.083
See you in the morning.

161
00:13:15.953 --> 00:13:17.054
Whoo.

162
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:54.256
This jump? It's true.
you need six people.

163
00:13:54.357 --> 00:13:56.125
But the reason
it's called the Hex

164
00:13:56.225 --> 00:13:59.562
is a couple of people
have died trying it.

165
00:13:59.662 --> 00:14:01.031
Seriously?

166
00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:02.899
That's
just an urban legend.

167
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.469
Nobody's ever died
doing the Hex.

168
00:14:06.569 --> 00:14:08.738
We can do something else
if you're uncomfortable. Sarah.

169
00:14:09.171 --> 00:14:10.573
You could just film us.

170
00:14:10.673 --> 00:14:13.409
I'm not much
of a bystander. Lisa.
Thanks. though.

171
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:14.878
That's what I'm talking about!

172
00:14:14.978 --> 00:14:16.345
No. not the white board!

173
00:14:16.445 --> 00:14:18.115
I hate
the white board.

174
00:14:18.214 --> 00:14:21.018
Yes. Wade. I know you do.
and I thought you might
have a hard time

175
00:14:21.118 --> 00:14:23.452
visualizing
this particular jump.

176
00:14:23.552 --> 00:14:24.620
So here...

177
00:14:26.789 --> 00:14:29.026
I made this just for you.

178
00:14:29.126 --> 00:14:30.359
Ooh.

179
00:14:30.459 --> 00:14:32.595
- Really?
- We fly like this.

180
00:14:32.695 --> 00:14:34.296
and on my key...

181
00:14:35.932 --> 00:14:39.635
Key... huh?

182
00:14:41.203 --> 00:14:43.106
Hardy-fucking-har.

183
00:14:44.473 --> 00:14:46.375
Fuck me. this actually
does help. though.

184
00:14:46.475 --> 00:14:48.411
Just try not to...

185
00:14:48.511 --> 00:14:51.048
Oh. my God.
Oh. my God. baby.

186
00:14:51.148 --> 00:14:53.116
Oh. no. don't do it.

187
00:15:05.128 --> 00:15:08.932
Remember. a collision
at these speeds
can knock you out cold.

188
00:15:09.032 --> 00:15:10.934
Err on the side of caution.

189
00:15:11.034 --> 00:15:12.568
We all have to die.

190
00:15:12.668 --> 00:15:15.738
But we don't have
to die today!

191
00:15:17.406 --> 00:15:20.911
That's right.
smart asses. Gear up.

192
00:15:23.579 --> 00:15:25.548
Looks like your altimeter's
sticking.

193
00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:29.452
Yeah. it does that
sometimes.

194
00:15:29.552 --> 00:15:32.455
It's all right.
My eyes can be my altimeter.

195
00:15:32.555 --> 00:15:35.192
I really don't think Sarah
should be center.

196
00:15:35.291 --> 00:15:36.860
It's her first time doing
any kind of formation.

197
00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.963
and you're putting her right
in the most dangerous slot.

198
00:15:40.063 --> 00:15:41.131
She'll be fine.

199
00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:44.000
Try thinking
with your other head?

200
00:15:44.101 --> 00:15:47.737
If anything happens to her.
it's gonna be your fault.

201
00:15:47.838 --> 00:15:49.139
Um. hi. guys.

202
00:15:49.238 --> 00:15:50.841
You know. I'm sitting
right here.

203
00:15:50.941 --> 00:15:54.010
Don't let her rattle you.
Lisa can be a little
overdramatic at times.

204
00:15:54.111 --> 00:15:55.578
Eat a dick. Greg.

205
00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:57.814
You'll be great.

206
00:15:57.914 --> 00:16:00.349
Yeah. and if you really
want to be great.

207
00:16:00.449 --> 00:16:02.018
you can flash
the pilot your boobs.

208
00:16:02.119 --> 00:16:03.954
and he'll give us
some extra altitude!

209
00:16:04.054 --> 00:16:05.021
In your dreams.

210
00:16:08.724 --> 00:16:11.228
All right.
everybody on comms!

211
00:16:11.327 --> 00:16:13.662
- Let's do this!
- Aw. yeah.

212
00:16:14.798 --> 00:16:18.467
Hey. Payson. what's
the capital of Thailand?

213
00:16:18.567 --> 00:16:19.702
What?

214
00:16:19.803 --> 00:16:21.370
- Bang Cock!
- Never gets old.

215
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:24.841
Ow. fucker. Just get
in the damn door. Evan.

216
00:16:24.941 --> 00:16:25.809
Let's get it on.

217
00:16:36.352 --> 00:16:38.387
Ready. set. go!

218
00:16:48.764 --> 00:16:50.466
<i>Nice and easy. Sarah.</i>

219
00:16:50.566 --> 00:16:53.435
<i>Nice and easy yourself.</i>
<i>I am in my slot.</i>

220
00:16:58.108 --> 00:17:01.044
<i>Okay. looking good.</i>
<i>everybody.</i>

221
00:17:02.611 --> 00:17:04.413
<i>Watch your levels.</i>

222
00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:10.686
<i>Ready... and...</i>

223
00:17:10.786 --> 00:17:12.555
<i>key!</i>

224
00:17:12.655 --> 00:17:14.423
<i>Oh. shit.</i>
<i>I'm losing it.</i>

225
00:17:14.523 --> 00:17:16.193
<i>Whoa. whoa.</i>
<i>whoa! Fuck! Shit!</i>

226
00:17:16.293 --> 00:17:18.394
<i>What the hell?!</i>

227
00:17:18.494 --> 00:17:20.329
<i>Well. guys.</i>
<i>that sucked.</i>

228
00:17:20.429 --> 00:17:22.598
<i>Break off.</i>
<i>Break off.</i>

229
00:17:35.011 --> 00:17:36.179
<i>Everybody good?</i>

230
00:17:36.279 --> 00:17:37.981
- <i>Greg's fine.</i>
<i>- Roger.</i>

231
00:17:38.081 --> 00:17:40.851
- <i>Go for Wade.</i>
<i>- Sarah's good.</i>

232
00:17:40.951 --> 00:17:42.085
<i>Is she. though?</i>

233
00:17:42.185 --> 00:17:44.687
<i>All right.</i>
<i>see you guys on the ground.</i>

234
00:17:49.893 --> 00:17:50.827
Whoo.

235
00:18:19.856 --> 00:18:21.358
How'd it go?

236
00:18:21.457 --> 00:18:23.026
Good enough.

237
00:18:23.827 --> 00:18:25.795
We can do better.
though.

238
00:18:42.212 --> 00:18:44.214
Here she comes.
She's coming. She's coming.

239
00:18:44.314 --> 00:18:45.648
Sorry about that. guys.

240
00:18:45.748 --> 00:18:47.583
My foot clipped Wade's head.
and I-I kinda bugged out.

241
00:18:47.683 --> 00:18:49.352
Hey. hey. no sweat.

242
00:18:49.451 --> 00:18:50.954
I got somethin' for ya.

243
00:18:52.389 --> 00:18:53.455
Homie hat!

244
00:18:56.458 --> 00:18:59.495
Ah. don't worry about it.
It's like a skydiving
dunce cap.

245
00:18:59.595 --> 00:19:01.364
- Yeah. it is.
- We've all been there.

246
00:19:01.463 --> 00:19:03.599
- Looks good on her.
- Was that seriously your first formation?

247
00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.769
Why. so you can make
a bunch of virgin jokes?

248
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.204
I told you that
last night.

249
00:19:08.305 --> 00:19:10.840
No. because
if it really
was your first time.

250
00:19:10.941 --> 00:19:12.809
then that means...

251
00:19:12.909 --> 00:19:15.011
Sarah's buying!

252
00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:25.121
So. are you stoked
on that jump or what?

253
00:19:25.221 --> 00:19:26.722
Yes.

254
00:19:26.823 --> 00:19:29.525
I mean. it-it does suck
that I messed it up.

255
00:19:29.625 --> 00:19:30.827
but...

256
00:19:30.927 --> 00:19:32.528
maybe I shouldn't expect
much on my first try.

257
00:19:32.628 --> 00:19:33.997
Nah. don't even sweat it.

258
00:19:34.097 --> 00:19:36.532
This crew's been jumping
together a while now.

259
00:19:36.632 --> 00:19:39.369
If I had a dollar
for every jump
that I fucked up.

260
00:19:39.468 --> 00:19:40.636
I could pay
for this beer...

261
00:19:40.736 --> 00:19:43.139
...and some pizza.

262
00:19:46.376 --> 00:19:48.144
- Who's that?
- My mother.

263
00:19:48.244 --> 00:19:49.545
If she knows
I've been out jumping

264
00:19:49.645 --> 00:19:51.414
and hasn't heard from me
by sunset.

265
00:19:51.513 --> 00:19:53.016
she tends
to assume the worst.

266
00:19:53.116 --> 00:19:54.516
Why's that?

267
00:19:54.616 --> 00:19:57.120
Did you have
a friend go in
or something?

268
00:19:58.587 --> 00:20:00.489
Something like that.

269
00:20:01.825 --> 00:20:04.294
Somebody close to you?

270
00:20:04.394 --> 00:20:05.661
Yeah.

271
00:20:06.896 --> 00:20:09.199
Is that why
you jump alone?

272
00:20:09.299 --> 00:20:10.834
That's part of it.

273
00:20:10.934 --> 00:20:12.268
I've only been jumping
a couple of years.

274
00:20:12.369 --> 00:20:15.939
I never had a friend
die skydiving.

275
00:20:16.039 --> 00:20:17.273
You will.

276
00:20:19.309 --> 00:20:21.111
Eventually. we all do.

277
00:20:56.578 --> 00:20:58.547
All right. guys.
Now listen up.

278
00:21:00.817 --> 00:21:02.185
Hang on. Wait a second.

279
00:21:02.285 --> 00:21:04.686
All right. so I want to run
the Hex again tomorrow.

280
00:21:04.787 --> 00:21:06.588
This time.
with no mistakes.

281
00:21:06.688 --> 00:21:09.725
I think we can all agree
that we put a little
too much stress on Sarah

282
00:21:09.826 --> 00:21:11.494
by putting her in the middle.

283
00:21:11.593 --> 00:21:13.662
I think we can also agree
that somebody already tried
to tell you that.

284
00:21:13.762 --> 00:21:16.632
Which is why
I'm going to be
taking the center.

285
00:21:16.732 --> 00:21:18.835
- Whoo!
- Sarah...

286
00:21:20.103 --> 00:21:22.272
You'll be right here
across from me.

287
00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.675
Evan...
you're right here.

288
00:21:28.044 --> 00:21:28.978
Greg...

289
00:21:29.079 --> 00:21:35.018
you'll be right here
between Lisa and Wade.

290
00:21:37.287 --> 00:21:40.924
Guys. if this was easy.
everyone would do it.

291
00:21:43.293 --> 00:21:46.296
Get some rest.
and I'll see you
at the ass-crack of dawn.

292
00:21:50.033 --> 00:21:51.501
All right.
see you. Payson.

293
00:21:55.405 --> 00:21:58.908
Whatever. Wade.
come on. let's go.

294
00:21:59.008 --> 00:22:04.380
I guess we're leaving.
I'm riding with you.
I'm out. bro.

295
00:22:04.481 --> 00:22:06.049
Lisa. wait up.

296
00:22:06.149 --> 00:22:07.783
She loves me.

297
00:22:08.985 --> 00:22:11.020
Don't take it
too personally.

298
00:22:11.121 --> 00:22:12.721
Lisa's just jealous.

299
00:22:12.822 --> 00:22:15.992
And she doesn't have
a terribly high emotional IQ.

300
00:22:16.092 --> 00:22:19.395
That's stupid.
She's just as good
a skydiver as I am.

301
00:22:19.496 --> 00:22:21.630
Not that. Payson.

302
00:22:24.534 --> 00:22:26.102
Are they a thing?

303
00:22:26.202 --> 00:22:29.771
Used to be. Lisa still
wants them to be.

304
00:22:29.873 --> 00:22:31.975
But that was never
gonna work out.

305
00:22:32.075 --> 00:22:35.211
They don't seem
exactly compatible.

306
00:22:36.279 --> 00:22:38.214
She's fucking crazy!

307
00:22:38.314 --> 00:22:40.316
Oh. good.

308
00:22:43.253 --> 00:22:46.122
You take the bad
with the good. I guess.

309
00:22:46.222 --> 00:22:49.159
She deals with enough
of our shit.
that's for sure.

310
00:22:52.362 --> 00:22:53.997
See ya dark and early.

311
00:23:19.923 --> 00:23:23.393
Hey. You want a beer?

312
00:23:23.493 --> 00:23:25.195
Much obliged.

313
00:23:28.531 --> 00:23:30.433
I saw you guys
tried the Hex today.

314
00:23:33.303 --> 00:23:37.874
Yeah. but I fucked it up.
Obviously.

315
00:23:39.509 --> 00:23:40.977
No shame in that.

316
00:23:41.544 --> 00:23:43.446
The Hex is
a tough formation.

317
00:23:44.447 --> 00:23:47.850
Maybe a handful
of people in the world
that could pull it off.

318
00:23:49.519 --> 00:23:50.987
Have you seen it done?

319
00:23:52.222 --> 00:23:53.289
I have.

320
00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:56.993
Trying it again tomorrow.

321
00:23:58.127 --> 00:23:59.429
Wow!

322
00:24:01.331 --> 00:24:03.166
Good luck.

323
00:24:07.503 --> 00:24:08.438
Thanks.

324
00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.795
Do you know how bad
those things are for you?

325
00:24:32.895 --> 00:24:35.064
Yeah. well. we're all
gonna croak sometime.

326
00:24:35.164 --> 00:24:39.235
Yeah. but taurine overdose
seems like a pretty
stupid reason.

327
00:24:39.335 --> 00:24:42.538
Yeah. well. you die
your way. cupcake.
I'll die mine.

328
00:24:49.245 --> 00:24:51.481
All right.
skydive! Whoo!

329
00:24:51.581 --> 00:24:52.849
Oh!

330
00:24:57.587 --> 00:24:58.621
How's it going. Jerry?

331
00:24:58.721 --> 00:25:00.223
Payson!
How you doing. man?

332
00:25:00.323 --> 00:25:03.559
Not quite as well as you.
by the looks of things.

333
00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:04.627
And what's your name?

334
00:25:04.727 --> 00:25:05.762
Her name's Ingrid.

335
00:25:05.862 --> 00:25:07.764
Only speaks
a few words of English.

336
00:25:07.864 --> 00:25:09.732
Ingrid. huh?

337
00:25:09.832 --> 00:25:11.467
You lucky bastard.

338
00:25:12.635 --> 00:25:13.736
Come on. let's load up.

339
00:25:25.581 --> 00:25:28.217
Good morning. L.A. center.
jump 2 is lighting up.

340
00:25:28.318 --> 00:25:31.020
We'll be climbing
at 12.000 feet this mornin'.

341
00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.889
Appreciate any advisories.

342
00:25:34.724 --> 00:25:37.827
<i>Jump 2. L.A.</i>
<i>center. good morning.</i>

343
00:25:37.927 --> 00:25:42.899
<i>Advise when you're wheels up.</i>
<i>Expect clear skies</i>
<i>from one to two thousand.</i>

344
00:25:42.999 --> 00:25:45.201
<i>Be advised moderate</i>
<i>to severe turbulence reported</i>

345
00:25:45.301 --> 00:25:48.604
<i>all the way to 15.000 feet.</i>

346
00:25:48.705 --> 00:25:51.841
<i>Buckle up. jump 2.</i>
<i>It's gonna be a bumpy ride.</i>

347
00:25:53.276 --> 00:25:55.311
<i>Copy that. We're rolling.</i>

348
00:26:26.109 --> 00:26:27.443
Hey. Jer.

349
00:26:27.543 --> 00:26:30.446
what about getting
a little extra altitude. huh?

350
00:26:30.546 --> 00:26:32.148
I'm not askin' her.

351
00:26:33.015 --> 00:26:36.352
Hey. Ingrid. do you want
the plane to go higher?

352
00:26:36.452 --> 00:26:39.756
Yeah. Ingrid.
have a longer skydive?

353
00:26:39.857 --> 00:26:40.957
Yeah. sure.
Okay.

354
00:26:41.057 --> 00:26:42.925
All you have to do is....

355
00:26:43.025 --> 00:26:44.494
Show the boobs
to the pilot.

356
00:26:44.594 --> 00:26:47.630
and he'll take us up
an extra thousand feet.

357
00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:49.399
I-I wouldn't lie to you.

358
00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:52.034
Yo. Andy!

359
00:26:52.135 --> 00:26:54.103
Ingrid wants
to show you something!

360
00:27:02.779 --> 00:27:04.213
Sorry about that. folks!

361
00:27:04.313 --> 00:27:06.516
I think the man upstairs
gave us some turbulence

362
00:27:06.616 --> 00:27:09.519
just to make those beautiful
titties bounce!

363
00:27:09.619 --> 00:27:12.588
I'd say that's definitely
worth some extra altitude!

364
00:27:15.826 --> 00:27:16.993
What'd I miss?

365
00:27:25.836 --> 00:27:27.303
Crouch down for me.

366
00:27:27.403 --> 00:27:30.239
Here we go!
Ready. steady. go!

367
00:27:41.551 --> 00:27:43.286
All right. guys.
Here we go.

368
00:27:43.386 --> 00:27:45.588
Ready. set. go!

369
00:28:22.558 --> 00:28:24.760
<i>All right. guys.</i>
<i>here we go.</i>

370
00:28:24.862 --> 00:28:27.263
<i>Ready... key!</i>

371
00:28:29.699 --> 00:28:32.268
<i>And key!</i>

372
00:28:33.102 --> 00:28:34.872
<i>Come on. guys. you got it.</i>

373
00:28:34.972 --> 00:28:36.706
<i>Come on. don't let go.</i>

374
00:28:36.807 --> 00:28:38.474
<i>Holy shit. we did it.</i>

375
00:28:38.574 --> 00:28:39.575
<i>Yeah.</i>

376
00:28:40.944 --> 00:28:42.678
<i>Yeah. you!</i>
<i>Ha-ha! All right!</i>

377
00:28:42.778 --> 00:28:44.213
<i>Yeah! Whoo!</i>

378
00:28:44.313 --> 00:28:45.916
<i>That's what I'm</i>
<i>talking about!</i>

379
00:28:46.015 --> 00:28:47.818
<i>Yeah! Awesome!</i>
<i>We got it guys!</i>

380
00:28:47.918 --> 00:28:51.387
- <i>Holy shit.</i>
<i>that was bad-ass.</i>

381
00:28:51.487 --> 00:28:53.322
<i>Good job. guys.</i>
<i>Good shit.</i>

382
00:28:54.323 --> 00:28:55.959
<i>What the fuck</i>
<i>just happened?</i>

383
00:28:56.058 --> 00:28:57.895
- <i>Did I just</i> <i>fucking see that?
- </i> - <i>Oh. my God!</i>

384
00:28:57.995 --> 00:29:00.162
<i>- </i> <i>What the fuck. man?</i>
<i>- Does anyone see him?</i>

385
00:29:00.263 --> 00:29:02.331
<i>We gotta go.</i>
<i>We gotta go. Break off!</i>

386
00:29:15.578 --> 00:29:17.413
<i>Evan. do you</i>
<i>see him anywhere?</i>

387
00:29:17.513 --> 00:29:19.248
<i>I don't see</i>
<i>his parachute.</i>

388
00:29:19.348 --> 00:29:21.450
<i>I don't see him.</i>

389
00:29:28.658 --> 00:29:31.761
- Where's Payson?
- I don't know.

390
00:29:31.862 --> 00:29:33.396
- Where the hell is he?
- He's gone.

391
00:29:33.496 --> 00:29:35.032
All of a sudden.
he was just gone!

392
00:29:35.131 --> 00:29:36.566
Guys. guys.

393
00:29:36.666 --> 00:29:38.701
It was like he was there
one second. and then
he wasn't.

394
00:29:38.802 --> 00:29:40.236
He must have pulled early.

395
00:29:40.336 --> 00:29:42.005
If he pulled early.
we'd be able to see
his canopy.

396
00:29:42.104 --> 00:29:43.840
Unless it didn't open.

397
00:29:53.182 --> 00:29:54.550
- Disappeared?
- Yeah.

398
00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:56.285
Bill. I know
how this sounds.
but I saw what I saw.

399
00:29:56.385 --> 00:29:58.554
Guys. I've owned
this drop zone
for 22 years.

400
00:29:58.654 --> 00:30:00.256
Nobody has ever
just disappeared.

401
00:30:00.356 --> 00:30:02.491
But that's what happened.

402
00:30:02.592 --> 00:30:04.527
Here's what we'll do.
I'll grab a bunch of people.

403
00:30:04.627 --> 00:30:06.462
We'll get them out
in their cars
searching for him.

404
00:30:06.562 --> 00:30:08.698
We'll find him
on the side of the road
packing his parachute.

405
00:30:08.799 --> 00:30:11.001
Somebody should call
the cops. or the paramedics
or whatever.

406
00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:12.501
Man. we don't even know
if he's injured.

407
00:30:12.602 --> 00:30:14.071
He could be stuck
in a tree somewhere

408
00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:15.538
or landed
in someone's backyard.

409
00:30:15.638 --> 00:30:17.173
Right. I can drive.
I can help look.

410
00:30:17.273 --> 00:30:19.342
- I'll go with you.
- All right. let's go.

411
00:30:21.845 --> 00:30:24.480
It's just--
I consider myself
a rational person.

412
00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:26.917
and I'm having
a really hard time with this.

413
00:30:27.017 --> 00:30:29.552
I mean. what did you see?

414
00:30:29.652 --> 00:30:31.654
I saw what you saw.

415
00:30:33.289 --> 00:30:35.458
I guess it's possible
he could have just...

416
00:30:35.558 --> 00:30:37.828
I don't know.
had some sort
of canopy malfunction

417
00:30:37.928 --> 00:30:39.228
and had to cut away.

418
00:30:39.328 --> 00:30:41.764
I just feel like one of us
would have seen something.

419
00:30:44.233 --> 00:30:46.036
That's my worst nightmare.

420
00:30:46.135 --> 00:30:47.904
Having to cut away.

421
00:30:48.005 --> 00:30:50.439
- You never had to?
- Nope.

422
00:30:51.374 --> 00:30:53.209
Not that big
of a deal. really.

423
00:30:53.309 --> 00:30:55.979
I mean. when it happens.
it's like time slows way down.

424
00:30:56.079 --> 00:30:57.780
You know what I mean?

425
00:30:57.881 --> 00:30:59.049
And then you just...

426
00:30:59.148 --> 00:31:00.516
Pull your cut-away handle
to lose the mess.

427
00:31:00.616 --> 00:31:03.053
pull your reserve handle
to save your life.

428
00:31:03.152 --> 00:31:05.889
Everyone has to do it.
sooner or later.

429
00:31:05.989 --> 00:31:08.758
There's a part of me
that just wishes
it would happen.

430
00:31:08.859 --> 00:31:11.560
Then maybe it wouldn't
scare me so much.

431
00:31:12.929 --> 00:31:14.163
It wakes me up at night.

432
00:31:14.263 --> 00:31:16.133
My canopy malfunctions.
and for whatever reason.

433
00:31:16.232 --> 00:31:19.535
I can't control it.
I can't cut away.

434
00:31:19.635 --> 00:31:21.537
I used to have
dreams like that.

435
00:31:21.637 --> 00:31:22.605
Used to?

436
00:31:22.705 --> 00:31:24.373
Now I have nightmares
we're about to crash.

437
00:31:24.473 --> 00:31:27.343
I'm stuck inside the plane
and can't get out the door.

438
00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.548
Hey. stop here.

439
00:31:55.105 --> 00:31:56.639
If we don't find him soon.

440
00:31:56.739 --> 00:32:00.077
the chances of finding him
at all are gonna be
pretty slim.

441
00:32:00.177 --> 00:32:03.379
Damn it. Payson.
Where the hell are you?

442
00:32:06.549 --> 00:32:07.884
Come on.

443
00:32:26.268 --> 00:32:28.404
<i>We covered</i>
<i>as much as we could.</i>

444
00:32:28.504 --> 00:32:29.772
<i>There's no sign of him.</i>

445
00:32:29.873 --> 00:32:31.540
All right. copy that.

446
00:32:35.611 --> 00:32:37.848
Andy circled with a spotter
'til it got dark.

447
00:32:37.948 --> 00:32:39.015
They didn't see anything.

448
00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:41.650
- And the cops?
- Nothin'.

449
00:32:42.819 --> 00:32:43.987
They're waiting inside.

450
00:32:44.087 --> 00:32:46.255
Sarah. they want
to talk to you.

451
00:32:55.232 --> 00:32:59.401
Yeah. that's. uh.
pretty much what I heard
from everyone else.

452
00:32:59.502 --> 00:33:01.204
Now. I have to ask.

453
00:33:01.303 --> 00:33:04.473
Did any of you partake
in any controlled substances
when you went up?

454
00:33:06.408 --> 00:33:09.179
We weren't high.
if that's what you're asking.

455
00:33:09.278 --> 00:33:13.682
Okay. Well. maybe it was
an alien abduction.

456
00:33:13.783 --> 00:33:16.219
Maybe a UFO swooped in
and scooped him up

457
00:33:16.318 --> 00:33:17.821
with a tractor beam.

458
00:33:17.921 --> 00:33:20.157
You think this is funny?

459
00:33:20.257 --> 00:33:21.657
Not at all.

460
00:33:21.757 --> 00:33:23.827
He could be dead or--
or dying out there
somewhere.

461
00:33:23.927 --> 00:33:26.662
and you're sitting here
cracking jokes?

462
00:33:26.762 --> 00:33:27.696
Maybe.

463
00:33:28.697 --> 00:33:29.866
Or maybe...

464
00:33:29.966 --> 00:33:32.135
I don't know. he's sipping
Mai Tais in Palm Springs.

465
00:33:32.235 --> 00:33:33.302
What do you think?

466
00:33:33.904 --> 00:33:36.006
What the hell
are you talking about?

467
00:33:36.106 --> 00:33:37.573
Look at the video!

468
00:33:37.673 --> 00:33:39.508
Oh. I have them all
right here.

469
00:33:40.409 --> 00:33:41.912
How about this video?

470
00:33:47.184 --> 00:33:48.717
This one?

471
00:33:51.487 --> 00:33:52.989
What about this one?

472
00:33:55.892 --> 00:33:58.761
Your friend's not
on any of these videos.

473
00:34:00.063 --> 00:34:01.798
He may very well be missing.

474
00:34:01.898 --> 00:34:05.068
But something
about your story's
not checking out.

475
00:35:58.982 --> 00:36:00.383
<i>Get up.</i>

476
00:36:06.455 --> 00:36:08.158
Another point for me.

477
00:36:09.159 --> 00:36:11.027
I shut her down again.

478
00:36:28.445 --> 00:36:29.813
Oh!

479
00:36:53.569 --> 00:36:54.838
Payson?

480
00:37:08.485 --> 00:37:09.819
Jesus fucking Christ!

481
00:37:10.786 --> 00:37:11.955
Payson. what the--

482
00:37:12.055 --> 00:37:13.156
Get up!

483
00:37:17.394 --> 00:37:19.262
What the fuck?

484
00:38:47.517 --> 00:38:49.052
Shit!

485
00:39:15.512 --> 00:39:17.080
<i>Hurry.</i>

486
00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:22.178
Open the door.

487
00:40:22.278 --> 00:40:23.813
Payson! Oh. my God!

488
00:40:26.816 --> 00:40:27.749
Payson.

489
00:40:53.042 --> 00:40:55.144
That's the dumbest story
I ever heard.

490
00:40:56.546 --> 00:40:57.779
You had a bad dream
last night

491
00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.415
because of what happened
yesterday.

492
00:40:59.515 --> 00:41:00.817
That's it.

493
00:41:00.917 --> 00:41:02.986
I didn't sleep great
last night either.

494
00:41:03.086 --> 00:41:05.455
This is more
than just a bad dream. Lisa.

495
00:41:06.823 --> 00:41:08.091
Show her.

496
00:41:10.827 --> 00:41:12.328
This is Payson's. isn't it?

497
00:41:13.363 --> 00:41:15.098
Just found it
on the ground last night.

498
00:41:15.198 --> 00:41:17.200
What the fuck. Wade?
How do you have
his altimeter?

499
00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:18.401
I don't know.

500
00:41:18.501 --> 00:41:20.903
I'm pretty sure he had it
on the jump yesterday.

501
00:41:21.004 --> 00:41:22.405
Yeah. he definitely
had it.

502
00:41:22.505 --> 00:41:24.941
I remember because I noticed
it was sticking the other day.

503
00:41:25.041 --> 00:41:26.442
It was stuck on zero.

504
00:41:26.542 --> 00:41:29.078
Well. you guys jump
if you want to. I'm out of here.

505
00:41:33.782 --> 00:41:36.185
She's fine.
She'll be back tomorrow.

506
00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:40.123
What do you think. Evan?
You've been pretty quiet.

507
00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:43.059
Payson.

508
00:41:45.495 --> 00:41:47.063
Do we think he's dead?

509
00:41:48.031 --> 00:41:51.467
And if he is.
who did you guys
see last night?

510
00:41:51.567 --> 00:41:52.969
All right. look.

511
00:41:53.069 --> 00:41:54.871
We still don't know
what happened to Payson.

512
00:41:54.971 --> 00:41:57.507
But whatever happened.
he's not haunting us.

513
00:42:02.011 --> 00:42:04.013
I didn't think you guys
would make it in today.

514
00:42:04.113 --> 00:42:06.249
Well. we're all
about getting back
on the horse.

515
00:42:06.349 --> 00:42:09.018
- All right.
Be safe out there.
- Will do.

516
00:42:15.091 --> 00:42:17.327
It's our own fault.
you know?

517
00:42:17.427 --> 00:42:20.697
- For trying the Hex.
- Come on. a cursed skydive?

518
00:42:20.798 --> 00:42:22.065
Are you kidding me?

519
00:42:22.165 --> 00:42:24.100
It wasn't the formation.

520
00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:26.035
and we don't even know
for sure Payson's even dead.

521
00:42:26.135 --> 00:42:29.706
I'm sure. I saw him
last night. too.

522
00:42:29.807 --> 00:42:31.507
Only he said something to me.

523
00:42:39.515 --> 00:42:40.583
What'd he say.
dude?

524
00:42:43.553 --> 00:42:45.421
He said.
"You're next. Evan."

525
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:49.959
Like next. next?

526
00:42:51.961 --> 00:42:53.797
Guys. okay. May-maybe
Lisa's right.

527
00:42:53.896 --> 00:42:57.133
We're probably just suffering
from some sort of post-traumatic
stress or something.

528
00:43:13.049 --> 00:43:14.650
You guys want
to make a plan or what?

529
00:43:14.751 --> 00:43:17.954
No. I'm doing a solo.

530
00:43:27.964 --> 00:43:29.132
Think you can catch me?

531
00:43:29.232 --> 00:43:31.334
With one arm tied
behind my back.

532
00:43:31.434 --> 00:43:33.503
I'll even give you
a head start.

533
00:43:57.727 --> 00:43:58.961
<i>Oh. come on. Evan.</i>

534
00:43:59.061 --> 00:44:01.164
<i>You got to make me work</i>
<i>for it a little bit.</i>

535
00:44:02.732 --> 00:44:04.267
<i>Evan?</i>

536
00:44:05.968 --> 00:44:07.703
<i>Come on. Evan.</i>
<i>stop playing around.</i>

537
00:44:09.372 --> 00:44:10.440
<i>Evan?</i>

538
00:44:11.441 --> 00:44:12.675
<i>This isn't funny.</i>

539
00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:15.244
<i>Evan?</i>

540
00:44:16.245 --> 00:44:17.747
<i>Evan?</i>

541
00:44:17.848 --> 00:44:19.817
<i>Evan! Oh. my God!</i>

542
00:44:19.917 --> 00:44:21.517
<i>Evan!</i>

543
00:44:21.617 --> 00:44:22.952
<i>Come on!</i>

544
00:44:24.253 --> 00:44:25.856
<i>Come on. Evan!</i>

545
00:44:29.659 --> 00:44:31.661
<i>No! Shit!</i>

546
00:44:38.601 --> 00:44:39.635
<i>Evan!</i>

547
00:44:42.305 --> 00:44:44.574
<i>Evan. I'm gonna</i>
<i>jump you out.</i>

548
00:44:44.674 --> 00:44:46.175
<i>Come on. wake up.</i>

549
00:44:46.275 --> 00:44:48.211
<i>Come on. wake up!</i>

550
00:44:48.311 --> 00:44:49.312
<i>Come on!</i>

551
00:45:04.994 --> 00:45:07.730
<i>Evan. you've got to fly</i>
<i>your parachute.</i>

552
00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:12.702
<i>Evan. can you hear me?</i>

553
00:45:15.438 --> 00:45:17.673
<i>Come on. Evan.</i>
<i>you've got to wake up.</i>

554
00:45:32.054 --> 00:45:33.422
Evan!

555
00:45:33.523 --> 00:45:35.558
Oh. God. Evan!

556
00:45:35.658 --> 00:45:36.659
Oh!

557
00:45:38.361 --> 00:45:39.495
Shit!

558
00:45:39.595 --> 00:45:40.864
Guys. help!

559
00:45:40.964 --> 00:45:42.231
- Sarah!
- What happened?

560
00:45:42.331 --> 00:45:45.601
- Is he okay?
- Oh. my God!
Oh. my God!

561
00:45:45.701 --> 00:45:47.670
Fuck! Help!

562
00:45:50.139 --> 00:45:52.041
Oh. my God!
What the fuck?!

563
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:55.177
Hey! Evan! Hey. hey!

564
00:45:58.214 --> 00:46:00.249
His heart
isn't beating. Evan!

565
00:46:00.349 --> 00:46:01.784
Oh. man. this is bad.

566
00:46:01.885 --> 00:46:03.152
Holy shit.
He's not breathing.

567
00:46:03.252 --> 00:46:07.690
- Dude. he's not breathing.
- Evan!

568
00:46:30.047 --> 00:46:32.114
Wade went to tell Lisa
what happened.

569
00:46:33.249 --> 00:46:35.251
You did everything
you could.

570
00:46:37.086 --> 00:46:38.688
The paramedics said
it was cardiac arrest.

571
00:46:38.788 --> 00:46:42.025
He was probably dead
before he even hit
the ground.

572
00:46:42.124 --> 00:46:43.459
Cardiac arrest?

573
00:46:47.064 --> 00:46:49.131
Doesn't sound
very likely. does it?

574
00:46:50.232 --> 00:46:52.268
How long have you
been jumping. Greg?

575
00:46:54.203 --> 00:46:57.607
About five
or six years. Why?

576
00:46:57.707 --> 00:47:01.544
And have you ever heard
of anything like this
happening before?

577
00:47:01.644 --> 00:47:03.379
To someone his age?

578
00:47:06.083 --> 00:47:07.350
No.

579
00:47:27.104 --> 00:47:28.571
Is this who I think it is?

580
00:47:29.338 --> 00:47:30.941
That's me and my Dad.

581
00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:33.910
That's the last picture
we ever took together.

582
00:47:34.978 --> 00:47:37.446
I've just heard
so many awesome stories
about him.

583
00:47:38.949 --> 00:47:41.417
Yeah. There's
a lot of those.

584
00:47:42.752 --> 00:47:46.056
He designed some of the best
freefly formations ever.

585
00:47:46.155 --> 00:47:47.223
He's a legend.

586
00:47:47.858 --> 00:47:50.861
I take it he's the reason
you started skydiving?

587
00:47:51.094 --> 00:47:52.628
Yeah.

588
00:47:52.728 --> 00:47:55.398
He and his friends
made it look
so cool. you know?

589
00:47:55.498 --> 00:47:58.434
Even when I was little.
I wanted to be just like him.

590
00:47:59.235 --> 00:48:01.170
I'm sure he'd be
proud of you.

591
00:48:03.106 --> 00:48:04.975
I wish my mom
thought that way.

592
00:48:05.775 --> 00:48:09.612
After I made my first jump.
I think she was ready
to disown me.

593
00:48:10.613 --> 00:48:13.382
I think that's
a typical reaction
from a mom. though. isn't it?

594
00:48:14.717 --> 00:48:18.788
It was more than just that.
So I left.

595
00:48:20.857 --> 00:48:22.525
Yeah. and now
you're back.

596
00:48:24.226 --> 00:48:25.361
Yeah.

597
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:29.265
Great timing. huh?

598
00:48:34.037 --> 00:48:36.439
I don't think
these last two days
have even hit me yet.

599
00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:39.742
It's not going to be easy
when it does.

600
00:48:43.512 --> 00:48:45.481
I just can't believe
what's happened.

601
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:16.146
That was...
unexpected.

602
00:49:16.847 --> 00:49:20.016
- Are you complaining?
- Not at all.

603
00:49:22.618 --> 00:49:25.321
So. what took you so long
to jump with us?

604
00:49:27.423 --> 00:49:29.558
It's not
that I didn't want to.

605
00:49:30.093 --> 00:49:30.994
It's just...

606
00:49:31.761 --> 00:49:33.629
I've never been
good at making friends.

607
00:49:34.263 --> 00:49:35.464
Why not?

608
00:49:39.035 --> 00:49:40.904
If I don't let anyone
get close...

609
00:49:42.505 --> 00:49:44.406
I can't leave
anyone behind.

610
00:49:47.177 --> 00:49:49.146
Shouldn't you let the people
who want to get close to you

611
00:49:49.246 --> 00:49:51.614
decide whether or not
they want to take
that chance?

612
00:49:53.282 --> 00:49:55.218
Maybe.

613
00:49:55.317 --> 00:49:56.987
But there's also
the flip side.

614
00:49:57.087 --> 00:49:58.521
When somebody dies
at the drop zone.

615
00:49:58.621 --> 00:50:03.592
it's easier
if it's... just some guy.

616
00:50:04.995 --> 00:50:06.830
Harder when it's
your friend...

617
00:50:08.064 --> 00:50:09.498
like Evan.

618
00:50:11.201 --> 00:50:13.502
Or Payson.

619
00:50:16.106 --> 00:50:20.277
Listen.
what happened to Evan
was just bad luck.

620
00:50:20.643 --> 00:50:22.745
And yeah. the timing is
a little weird. I admit.

621
00:50:22.979 --> 00:50:25.314
But we're gonna find out
what happened to Payson.

622
00:50:26.549 --> 00:50:28.018
And if he's dead?

623
00:50:29.152 --> 00:50:32.354
Then at least he died
doing something
that he loved.

624
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:35.158
That's such
a fucking cop-out.

625
00:50:36.259 --> 00:50:39.662
Don't you think
that Evan would be happy
to never make another skydive

626
00:50:39.762 --> 00:50:41.965
if it meant that he
could still be alive?

627
00:51:09.125 --> 00:51:10.392
<i>Hurry!</i>

628
00:51:46.296 --> 00:51:48.397
<i>Open the door.</i>

629
00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:05.815
- Sarah!
- Greg!

630
00:52:10.686 --> 00:52:12.488
Greg. open the door!

631
00:52:27.603 --> 00:52:30.340
Oh. my God!

632
00:52:50.994 --> 00:52:53.729
Don't seem to have much luck
with the fellas. do you?

633
00:52:55.131 --> 00:52:57.968
Two dead guys
and one missing
in so many days.

634
00:52:59.235 --> 00:53:01.670
- And?
- And I'm just saying.

635
00:53:02.272 --> 00:53:04.506
Doesn't exactly paint you
in the most flattering light.

636
00:53:21.458 --> 00:53:22.658
Listen...

637
00:53:23.994 --> 00:53:25.761
I don't think
that you did this.

638
00:53:26.963 --> 00:53:29.065
But it did happen
under your roof.

639
00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:34.237
Are you sure
there's nothing else
you want to tell me?

640
00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:39.042
I've told you everything.

641
00:53:42.711 --> 00:53:44.280
I'll be in touch.

642
00:53:54.424 --> 00:53:55.892
Lisa!

643
00:53:55.992 --> 00:53:58.495
- You happy now?
- What the hell
is your problem?

644
00:53:58.594 --> 00:54:00.897
You! You're
everyone's problem!

645
00:54:00.997 --> 00:54:03.366
All of this started
when you came
to the drop zone!

646
00:54:03.466 --> 00:54:04.434
You show up.

647
00:54:04.533 --> 00:54:05.768
First Payson disappears.

648
00:54:05.869 --> 00:54:07.237
Evan has a heart attack.

649
00:54:07.337 --> 00:54:09.772
Greg goes home with you
and somehow manages to break

650
00:54:09.873 --> 00:54:12.442
every bone in his body
in the middle of the night.

651
00:54:12.541 --> 00:54:15.577
I don't know what your deal is.
but there is something
very wrong with you.

652
00:54:15.677 --> 00:54:18.214
Come on. Lisa.
Just take it easy.

653
00:54:18.314 --> 00:54:20.450
Take it easy?
Fuck easy!

654
00:54:20.549 --> 00:54:23.286
How do you explain it.
Wade?

655
00:54:23.386 --> 00:54:24.521
I don't know!

656
00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:28.291
El Niño?

657
00:54:31.727 --> 00:54:34.030
Stay the hell away from me.

658
00:54:36.066 --> 00:54:37.566
Let's go. Wade.

659
00:54:45.241 --> 00:54:46.910
Are you fucking serious?

660
00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:48.812
She's not the bad guy
here. Lisa.

661
00:54:51.548 --> 00:54:54.317
Keep telling
yourself that.

662
00:55:02.724 --> 00:55:03.993
You okay?

663
00:55:05.028 --> 00:55:07.230
I need to get the hell
out of this house.

664
00:55:20.543 --> 00:55:21.845
What's up. guys?

665
00:55:22.678 --> 00:55:25.647
What are you
doing here? Two.

666
00:55:25.747 --> 00:55:28.852
What else are you gonna do
when no one wants to jump?

667
00:55:28.952 --> 00:55:30.920
Guess we're
in the right place. then.

668
00:55:35.791 --> 00:55:38.027
Sarah. you okay?

669
00:55:38.895 --> 00:55:41.131
Dude. Lisa went off on her.

670
00:55:41.564 --> 00:55:42.866
Told her
that she was a jinx.

671
00:55:43.133 --> 00:55:45.235
said that everything
that happened was her fault.

672
00:55:46.603 --> 00:55:47.669
That's stupid.

673
00:55:47.769 --> 00:55:48.972
I know. right?
That's what I told her.

674
00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:53.543
- It's not you. Sarah.
- Mm-mm.

675
00:55:53.642 --> 00:55:55.044
It's the Hex.

676
00:55:55.145 --> 00:55:57.847
Oh. come on. Andy!

677
00:55:57.947 --> 00:55:59.315
Not this horseshit again.

678
00:55:59.415 --> 00:56:00.416
- Hey!
- No.

679
00:56:00.517 --> 00:56:03.086
I can't name
one team. not one.

680
00:56:03.186 --> 00:56:05.822
that's done it
and is still alive.

681
00:56:05.922 --> 00:56:07.490
And I've been
here a while.

682
00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:10.260
I mean. heck. Kris.
you've been here
longer than I have.

683
00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:11.928
Can you?

684
00:56:13.263 --> 00:56:14.730
Nope.

685
00:56:16.332 --> 00:56:20.136
Okay. look. I'm-I'm
as superstitious
as anyone.

686
00:56:20.236 --> 00:56:21.905
I touch the wing
of the plane before I get in.

687
00:56:22.005 --> 00:56:24.274
I-I-I don't take
pictures before I jump.

688
00:56:24.374 --> 00:56:27.310
but I don't believe
in any stupid Hex curse.
Come on!

689
00:56:28.645 --> 00:56:32.348
That's what Payson said
when I asked him not to do it.

690
00:56:32.448 --> 00:56:34.017
He laughed at me.

691
00:56:35.251 --> 00:56:38.354
He said. "Don't put
that bad juju
in people's heads."

692
00:56:39.989 --> 00:56:41.891
He said you'd
mess up the jump.

693
00:56:43.426 --> 00:56:44.994
So. I kept my mouth shut.

694
00:56:46.029 --> 00:56:48.097
You could have said
something.

695
00:56:49.265 --> 00:56:50.433
Would you have listened?

696
00:56:52.969 --> 00:56:54.470
That's the problem
with you guys.

697
00:56:54.571 --> 00:56:58.274
I mean. just the idea
of death makes things
more enticing.

698
00:56:58.374 --> 00:56:59.943
Oh. come on. Andy!

699
00:57:00.043 --> 00:57:02.412
It sounds like
total bullshit to me.

700
00:57:03.613 --> 00:57:05.982
Where--
where are you going?

701
00:57:06.082 --> 00:57:09.018
To find out
if we're cursed or not.
Are you coming?

702
00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:29.239
When you said
that we were gonna find
some spiritual help.

703
00:57:29.339 --> 00:57:32.008
I thought you meant
hire an exorcist or something.

704
00:57:32.108 --> 00:57:34.310
Why? It's not like
we're being possessed.

705
00:57:35.845 --> 00:57:37.313
Okay. that's a good point.

706
00:57:39.916 --> 00:57:43.186
I'm not very flexible.
Just FYI.

707
00:57:44.454 --> 00:57:45.989
Thanks. Dianne.

708
00:57:47.290 --> 00:57:49.359
Sarah?

709
00:57:52.095 --> 00:57:53.997
Are you okay?
What's going on?

710
00:57:54.097 --> 00:57:56.866
Hi. Mom. This is
my friend. Wade.

711
00:57:57.834 --> 00:57:59.636
- Hmm.
- You got a minute?

712
00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:03.039
Um... of course.
You guys come on back.

713
00:58:07.076 --> 00:58:09.212
What did the police say?

714
00:58:10.013 --> 00:58:12.582
Nothing.
Guy's worthless.

715
00:58:12.682 --> 00:58:15.952
I think I'm
their prime suspect.
if that tells you anything.

716
00:58:18.621 --> 00:58:20.423
We need some help. Mom.

717
00:58:21.457 --> 00:58:25.962
Well. I'm not sure
I can be much help. but...

718
00:58:28.898 --> 00:58:31.668
let's start by centering
ourselves.

719
00:58:33.803 --> 00:58:35.104
Find a comfortable
seated position.

720
00:58:35.204 --> 00:58:37.206
something you can hold
for a while.

721
00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:46.182
You can lie down.
if that's easier.

722
00:58:47.684 --> 00:58:50.286
Ah! This is good.

723
00:58:50.386 --> 00:58:54.023
Close your eyes
and try to relax.

724
00:58:54.123 --> 00:58:57.660
- breathing easily
and deeply...

725
00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:02.365
repeating the Sanskrit mantra
<i>So Hum</i> in your mind.

726
00:59:03.933 --> 00:59:09.038
<i>So</i> on the inhale.
<i>Hum </i> on the exhale.

727
00:59:10.773 --> 00:59:13.443
<i>So... hum.</i>

728
00:59:22.085 --> 00:59:23.653
Yo. Andy!

729
00:59:23.753 --> 00:59:26.289
Ingrid wants
to show you something!

730
00:59:29.192 --> 00:59:31.194
What the fuck was that?

731
00:59:31.294 --> 00:59:32.362
Everybody out!

732
00:59:32.462 --> 00:59:33.463
Open the door!

733
00:59:35.331 --> 00:59:37.633
What happened?
Did I pass out?

734
00:59:38.836 --> 00:59:42.271
You didn't just pass out.
You had like a full-on seizure.

735
00:59:45.408 --> 00:59:46.476
What did you see?

736
00:59:49.879 --> 00:59:51.948
It was the day
we did the Hex.

737
00:59:52.048 --> 00:59:54.150
The last time
we saw Payson.

738
00:59:55.718 --> 00:59:57.520
Only it was different.

739
00:59:58.421 --> 01:00:01.124
Something went wrong
with the plane.

740
01:00:02.826 --> 01:00:05.128
Mom? What's wrong?
What is it?

741
01:00:07.530 --> 01:00:08.731
It's. uh...

742
01:00:08.832 --> 01:00:12.135
it's just been a long time
since I've heard that name.

743
01:00:13.871 --> 01:00:15.438
What name?

744
01:00:16.973 --> 01:00:18.408
The Hex.

745
01:00:19.475 --> 01:00:21.477
Wait. why does your mom
know the Hex?

746
01:00:21.711 --> 01:00:24.247
- How do you know the Hex?
- Mom?

747
01:00:27.316 --> 01:00:29.887
After your father died.
people watched the video
of his death

748
01:00:29.986 --> 01:00:32.488
over and over again
to see what went wrong.

749
01:00:34.323 --> 01:00:36.426
But it was
just an accident.

750
01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:39.362
It wasn't anyone's fault.

751
01:00:40.396 --> 01:00:42.765
Sarah. if she's saying
that your dad died
doing the Hex.

752
01:00:42.866 --> 01:00:43.966
I'm gonna flip my shit!

753
01:00:44.066 --> 01:00:46.002
What I'm saying...

754
01:00:46.102 --> 01:00:48.538
is it wasn't always
called the Hex.

755
01:00:49.873 --> 01:00:52.175
Your father never
called it the Hex.

756
01:00:53.242 --> 01:00:57.046
They only started
calling it that
after the other deaths.

757
01:00:57.146 --> 01:00:59.282
The unexplained ones.

758
01:01:01.484 --> 01:01:03.119
Unexplained deaths?

759
01:01:03.219 --> 01:01:05.421
All but one
of your father's team.

760
01:01:06.556 --> 01:01:09.559
And the other teams
stupid enough to try it.

761
01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:12.695
They didn't all
necessarily die
on a skydive.

762
01:01:12.796 --> 01:01:14.664
but it never ended well.

763
01:01:16.165 --> 01:01:17.767
Eventually.
it just became...

764
01:01:18.836 --> 01:01:22.305
the thing that people
talked about
around a bonfire.

765
01:01:22.405 --> 01:01:25.141
Why didn't you ever
tell me any of this?

766
01:01:25.241 --> 01:01:26.309
You had a hard enough time

767
01:01:26.409 --> 01:01:28.077
dealing
with your father's death.

768
01:01:29.345 --> 01:01:31.481
I thought I was
protecting you.

769
01:01:37.086 --> 01:01:38.488
Take this.

770
01:01:38.588 --> 01:01:41.724
Why? To meditate?

771
01:01:42.525 --> 01:01:45.061
Just tell me what the hell
we're supposed to do now.

772
01:01:46.529 --> 01:01:48.097
I wish I could.

773
01:01:58.374 --> 01:01:59.475
So?

774
01:02:01.377 --> 01:02:03.446
So what?

775
01:02:03.546 --> 01:02:05.581
So. what do you think?

776
01:02:07.383 --> 01:02:10.286
Are you sure that your mom's
not some New Age weirdo?

777
01:02:10.954 --> 01:02:13.289
Talking about things
from like ten years ago?

778
01:02:14.357 --> 01:02:16.325
That can't be
what's happening.

779
01:02:16.425 --> 01:02:18.694
Do you really believe that?

780
01:02:20.530 --> 01:02:23.099
Next time. we go
to the exorcist.

781
01:02:35.311 --> 01:02:39.215
Bet those solo skydives
look really good
right about now.

782
01:02:41.384 --> 01:02:42.318
Nah.

783
01:02:44.855 --> 01:02:47.456
Jumping alone
all those years...

784
01:02:49.058 --> 01:02:50.760
I was missing out.

785
01:02:54.430 --> 01:02:56.566
I'm glad
we're in this together.

786
01:02:58.301 --> 01:03:00.770
Fuckin' A.
Can't make it alone.

787
01:03:06.509 --> 01:03:09.312
I wish Lisa
were here right now.

788
01:03:09.412 --> 01:03:12.315
Why. so she could knock
some teeth out this time?

789
01:03:12.415 --> 01:03:15.819
No. I just feel--
I feel bad.

790
01:03:16.887 --> 01:03:18.521
She's part of the team.

791
01:03:19.823 --> 01:03:21.691
You know. whatever's
left of it.

792
01:03:24.895 --> 01:03:28.364
I just feel like we should
stick together. you know?

793
01:03:47.416 --> 01:03:49.251
I told you
not to come near me.

794
01:03:49.352 --> 01:03:51.487
Look. we wanted
to warn you.

795
01:03:52.154 --> 01:03:53.589
About what?

796
01:03:54.523 --> 01:03:56.392
You-you might need this.

797
01:03:56.827 --> 01:04:01.230
They-they are beads.
you know? Like beads.

798
01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:07.336
I think the plane
was supposed to crash
the day we did the Hex.

799
01:04:08.771 --> 01:04:10.306
Is that right?

800
01:04:12.375 --> 01:04:16.412
And maybe
it was supposed to crash
because we did the Hex.

801
01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:18.614
So. you're basing this

802
01:04:18.714 --> 01:04:21.283
on a vision you had
while doing yoga?

803
01:04:22.819 --> 01:04:24.720
- Yeah.
- Wow.

804
01:04:24.955 --> 01:04:26.355
And you. Wade?

805
01:04:27.057 --> 01:04:28.892
I was just
kinda lyin' there.

806
01:04:28.992 --> 01:04:30.794
Okay.

807
01:04:30.894 --> 01:04:34.031
Well. forgive me
if I don't take it
all that seriously.

808
01:04:34.597 --> 01:04:37.767
Nothing strange
has happened to you. Lisa.

809
01:04:37.868 --> 01:04:39.602
since Payson disappeared?

810
01:04:41.938 --> 01:04:43.205
Shit! Are you okay?

811
01:04:45.042 --> 01:04:46.308
I'm fine.

812
01:04:46.409 --> 01:04:48.310
Listen. I've heard enough.

813
01:04:48.411 --> 01:04:51.480
So. thanks for checking in.
but I'm good.
You should go.

814
01:04:53.083 --> 01:04:54.617
Lisa. come with us.

815
01:04:54.717 --> 01:04:56.185
You shouldn't have
to do this by yourself.

816
01:04:56.285 --> 01:04:57.753
None of us
should be alone.

817
01:04:57.854 --> 01:05:02.025
All I am doing is looking
for a little peace and quiet.

818
01:05:02.125 --> 01:05:03.526
Please.

819
01:05:31.654 --> 01:05:33.656
<i>Lisa...</i>

820
01:05:36.459 --> 01:05:40.429
<i>Lisa... Now you... Lisa...</i>

821
01:05:47.570 --> 01:05:50.539
<i>Lisa. Lisa. Lisa. Lisa...</i>

822
01:05:52.742 --> 01:05:54.510
Leave me alone!

823
01:06:03.719 --> 01:06:06.223
There's definitely something
she's not telling us.

824
01:06:12.929 --> 01:06:14.263
So now what?

825
01:06:15.331 --> 01:06:16.499
Wade.

826
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:54.703
How's our favorite Sheriff?

827
01:06:56.006 --> 01:06:58.809
He says I'm a person
of interest
in an ongoing case.

828
01:06:58.909 --> 01:07:01.544
and now I'm not supposed
to leave town.

829
01:07:03.612 --> 01:07:05.447
What the fuck
are we gonna do. Wade?

830
01:07:05.548 --> 01:07:08.251
Look. I knew that your turn
in there was gonna take
longer than mine.

831
01:07:08.350 --> 01:07:10.854
and so I found myself
back at the bar.

832
01:07:10.954 --> 01:07:12.923
Well. have you ever looked
at any of the old pictures

833
01:07:13.023 --> 01:07:14.456
hanging on the wall in there?

834
01:07:15.357 --> 01:07:16.960
Yeah. yeah.
I guess. Why?

835
01:07:17.060 --> 01:07:20.063
Well. I don't know.
I never really paid
attention until today.

836
01:07:22.598 --> 01:07:24.935
I found this hanging
on the wall in there.

837
01:07:25.035 --> 01:07:27.636
- You stole a picture
off the wall?
- Look at it.

838
01:07:28.805 --> 01:07:30.941
That's your dad's
old team. isn't it?

839
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:34.911
Does anybody
look familiar?

840
01:07:39.282 --> 01:07:40.616
Yeah.

841
01:08:19.488 --> 01:08:21.024
What're you doing here?

842
01:08:22.092 --> 01:08:23.759
What's-what--
what's that for?

843
01:08:25.262 --> 01:08:28.731
Gophers and other pests.

844
01:08:31.034 --> 01:08:33.502
Now. piss off.

845
01:08:34.304 --> 01:08:35.704
I don't take visitors.

846
01:08:35.805 --> 01:08:38.008
We want to ask you
about the Hex.

847
01:08:41.344 --> 01:08:42.178
Why me?

848
01:08:43.646 --> 01:08:45.849
Because we know
you did it. too.

849
01:08:48.852 --> 01:08:49.986
All right. then.

850
01:08:52.956 --> 01:08:54.024
Come on.

851
01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:58.427
Sit.

852
01:09:04.367 --> 01:09:06.136
I'm more of a beer guy.

853
01:09:07.137 --> 01:09:08.204
Suit yourself.

854
01:09:12.641 --> 01:09:15.912
You survived
the Hex. How?

855
01:09:17.546 --> 01:09:19.015
You knew
that we were gonna do it.

856
01:09:19.115 --> 01:09:22.518
Why didn't you warn us.
or-or try to stop us?

857
01:09:26.289 --> 01:09:28.158
Both good questions.

858
01:09:29.692 --> 01:09:31.861
I ever tell you
about my first jump?

859
01:09:32.796 --> 01:09:35.832
You've never said
more than two words
to any of us.

860
01:09:39.102 --> 01:09:40.703
I was as good as dead...

861
01:09:41.603 --> 01:09:43.974
the first time
I jumped out of an airplane.

862
01:09:45.442 --> 01:09:48.178
All I had to do
to live again was pull.

863
01:09:49.079 --> 01:09:51.147
That's intoxicating.

864
01:09:51.948 --> 01:09:54.017
I went right back up again...

865
01:09:55.584 --> 01:09:57.486
and it just wasn't
the same.

866
01:09:59.422 --> 01:10:00.689
Get to your point.

867
01:10:03.426 --> 01:10:05.829
To even come close
to that feeling again.

868
01:10:06.528 --> 01:10:09.799
I had to push my limits
further and further.

869
01:10:11.935 --> 01:10:13.003
Didn't help
that I wasn't born

870
01:10:13.103 --> 01:10:15.271
with any natural talent
for anything.

871
01:10:17.173 --> 01:10:19.976
Nah. My luck was going
to run out eventually.

872
01:10:21.378 --> 01:10:22.812
I needed help.

873
01:10:24.247 --> 01:10:26.816
Help? From who?

874
01:10:27.783 --> 01:10:32.088
I prayed to God.
the Devil.

875
01:10:34.924 --> 01:10:38.128
Out loud. hell.
even in my dreams.

876
01:10:40.662 --> 01:10:42.499
In the end.

877
01:10:42.598 --> 01:10:45.001
I think it was my soul
that conjured the demon.

878
01:10:47.603 --> 01:10:49.973
You. just like that.
you conjured a demon?

879
01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:52.708
Not "just like that"!

880
01:10:56.479 --> 01:11:00.316
Lanithro.
the demon of the air.

881
01:11:01.484 --> 01:11:03.053
showed me
how we could use the Hex

882
01:11:03.153 --> 01:11:04.720
to take what we wanted.

883
01:11:07.057 --> 01:11:09.893
You want to know
how I survived the Hex?

884
01:11:12.462 --> 01:11:14.164
I created it.

885
01:11:15.298 --> 01:11:19.235
You... made the Hex?

886
01:11:19.701 --> 01:11:22.738
Just imagine
what it feels like to know

887
01:11:22.839 --> 01:11:25.607
that you've got
lives to spare.

888
01:11:26.910 --> 01:11:31.881
I could... take any chance
I wanted. try anything...

889
01:11:32.648 --> 01:11:34.918
consequences be damned.

890
01:11:35.919 --> 01:11:37.821
I was given freedom...

891
01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:40.656
freedom from death itself.

892
01:11:42.724 --> 01:11:45.161
Because the lives of anyone
who tries the Hex...

893
01:11:46.863 --> 01:11:48.764
then belong to you.

894
01:11:51.468 --> 01:11:52.502
They're the sacrifice.

895
01:11:52.601 --> 01:11:54.037
More.

896
01:11:55.505 --> 01:11:59.275
I took more than their lives.
I-I took their abilities.

897
01:12:00.910 --> 01:12:03.012
Lanithro took their souls.

898
01:12:04.047 --> 01:12:08.451
It's a game he created
and never grew tired of.

899
01:12:08.551 --> 01:12:10.220
You lying son-of-a-bitch!

900
01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:11.620
Wade!

901
01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:14.057
What the fuck
did you really do?

902
01:12:14.157 --> 01:12:15.258
Wade! Enough!

903
01:12:15.358 --> 01:12:17.227
Get off of him!

904
01:12:26.069 --> 01:12:28.404
It was only ever supposed
to be one jump.

905
01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:32.275
And then.
the rumors got started.

906
01:12:33.543 --> 01:12:35.812
Human nature
was impossible to control.

907
01:12:36.913 --> 01:12:39.149
People just had to see
for themselves.

908
01:12:39.249 --> 01:12:42.152
I couldn't warn them.
and I couldn't warn you.

909
01:12:44.521 --> 01:12:45.754
It became known as the Hex.

910
01:12:45.955 --> 01:12:48.757
If that were true.
then you would be
immortal by now.

911
01:12:49.459 --> 01:12:52.061
What are you still doing
in this busted-ass trailer?

912
01:12:53.229 --> 01:12:54.931
That's not how it works.

913
01:12:56.032 --> 01:12:58.902
I mean. do I look like someone
who's gonna live forever?

914
01:13:00.803 --> 01:13:04.874
All those lives
are just second chances.

915
01:13:06.876 --> 01:13:08.845
And I wasted all of them.

916
01:13:10.547 --> 01:13:12.781
All I had left was my own.

917
01:13:14.184 --> 01:13:18.454
Once that happened.
I quit skydiving altogether.

918
01:13:20.023 --> 01:13:22.225
So. there's no way
to stop it?

919
01:13:22.325 --> 01:13:24.294
How many deaths are you
responsible for?

920
01:13:29.032 --> 01:13:30.967
Are you responsible
for my father?

921
01:13:31.868 --> 01:13:32.969
Sarah. get out of the way.

922
01:13:33.069 --> 01:13:34.337
Wade. what are you doing?

923
01:13:34.437 --> 01:13:36.005
Do you believe him?

924
01:13:38.474 --> 01:13:40.709
I don't know
what's happening.
but I know one thing.

925
01:13:40.810 --> 01:13:41.911
I take him out.
and I end it.

926
01:13:42.011 --> 01:13:43.880
You don't know that!

927
01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:45.048
What do you think. Kris?

928
01:13:45.148 --> 01:13:46.482
Think this'll end it?

929
01:13:47.550 --> 01:13:49.285
Please. Wade. Don't.

930
01:13:50.353 --> 01:13:51.321
No. no. no.

931
01:13:52.255 --> 01:13:53.289
No. let him.

932
01:13:53.389 --> 01:13:54.457
I want this.

933
01:13:55.258 --> 01:13:57.260
I want this to end.

934
01:13:58.561 --> 01:14:00.029
Wait.

935
01:14:02.899 --> 01:14:04.901
You never
answered my question.

936
01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:09.205
Your father was
a good man. Sarah.

937
01:14:09.806 --> 01:14:11.608
He didn't deserve
what happened to him.

938
01:14:11.708 --> 01:14:12.909
- I'm sorry.
- No.

939
01:14:13.009 --> 01:14:15.044
You motherfucker.

940
01:14:29.659 --> 01:14:31.060
Sarah...

941
01:14:32.161 --> 01:14:33.096
Sarah.

942
01:14:33.563 --> 01:14:35.064
Open the door.

943
01:14:36.232 --> 01:14:37.100
What?

944
01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:39.302
Open the door!

945
01:14:45.508 --> 01:14:49.012
Sarah. where were you?

946
01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:52.215
I don't know.

947
01:14:55.818 --> 01:14:59.188
Uh... I was on the plane.

948
01:14:59.689 --> 01:15:01.190
Before you did the Hex?

949
01:15:01.658 --> 01:15:04.494
Yeah. I think so.

950
01:15:07.130 --> 01:15:10.199
We were supposed to crash.
weren't we?

951
01:15:11.134 --> 01:15:13.503
The plane wasn't
supposed to crash.

952
01:15:15.004 --> 01:15:18.241
The plane is crashing.
Right now.

953
01:15:20.410 --> 01:15:21.811
What?

954
01:15:21.911 --> 01:15:23.780
This is how it happens.

955
01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:25.915
This is how the Hex works.

956
01:15:26.849 --> 01:15:29.252
You are not
where you think you are

957
01:15:29.352 --> 01:15:31.954
or even <i>when</i> you think
you are.

958
01:15:32.422 --> 01:15:34.190
You're occupying
the space and time

959
01:15:34.290 --> 01:15:38.361
between when you know
you're going to die
and when you die.

960
01:15:38.461 --> 01:15:42.098
And that space and time
can stretch out further
than you can imagine.

961
01:15:44.067 --> 01:15:45.501
That's impossible.

962
01:15:46.002 --> 01:15:47.236
You will continue to slip

963
01:15:47.337 --> 01:15:51.174
between this waking nightmare
and reality

964
01:15:51.507 --> 01:15:53.142
until you're dead.

965
01:15:58.147 --> 01:16:00.216
You're running out of time.

966
01:16:00.483 --> 01:16:02.885
but there is a way
if you'll let me help you.

967
01:16:02.985 --> 01:16:04.822
That's impossible.

968
01:16:05.088 --> 01:16:07.256
Do you have the altimeter?

969
01:16:08.958 --> 01:16:12.295
Payson's altimeter.
do you have it?

970
01:16:33.416 --> 01:16:34.283
Let's go!

971
01:16:38.588 --> 01:16:39.956
Fuck. his seatbelt!

972
01:16:45.595 --> 01:16:47.296
There's no time! Let's go!

973
01:16:47.397 --> 01:16:48.664
Evan. you're next!

974
01:17:02.678 --> 01:17:03.646
Andy!

975
01:17:03.746 --> 01:17:04.981
Thank God
you're still here.

976
01:17:05.081 --> 01:17:08.251
Yeah. I'm here. I'm
just puttin' away the plane.

977
01:17:08.351 --> 01:17:11.587
Holy Jesus. what happened?
Is that blood?

978
01:17:11.687 --> 01:17:13.322
Whoa! Whoa!

979
01:17:15.525 --> 01:17:18.094
What's the matter with you?
Let's go. let's go!

980
01:17:27.905 --> 01:17:29.539
Lost the right engine!

981
01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:32.375
We're losing altitude fast!

982
01:17:32.475 --> 01:17:34.343
We're super low!
Pull right away. guys!

983
01:17:40.818 --> 01:17:44.888
Hey. Hey.
you're all right.

984
01:17:44.987 --> 01:17:47.557
Just kinda faded
on me there
for a second.

985
01:17:48.124 --> 01:17:51.160
You were right
about the Hex.

986
01:17:51.260 --> 01:17:53.596
- We never should
have tried it.
- What?

987
01:17:54.197 --> 01:17:55.998
Is that what this
is all about?

988
01:17:56.299 --> 01:17:59.702
Andy. please.
I have to go now.

989
01:17:59.969 --> 01:18:01.370
I have to jump.

990
01:18:03.005 --> 01:18:05.208
It's the only way.

991
01:18:08.144 --> 01:18:10.179
I hope you know
what you're doin'.

992
01:18:51.587 --> 01:18:53.723
Would you all
kindly get the fuck
out of my plane?

993
01:18:53.824 --> 01:18:55.558
Lisa. now you!

994
01:19:00.196 --> 01:19:02.164
Fuck!

995
01:19:37.567 --> 01:19:39.168
Sarah. run.

996
01:19:57.955 --> 01:19:59.288
Oh. my God.

997
01:20:04.061 --> 01:20:05.194
No!

998
01:20:06.797 --> 01:20:08.397
Come on!

999
01:20:09.765 --> 01:20:11.567
Come on.

1000
01:20:58.882 --> 01:20:59.950
You made it.

1001
01:21:00.449 --> 01:21:04.821
You have no idea.
You have no fucking idea!

1002
01:21:04.921 --> 01:21:06.756
What the fuck
is happening?

1003
01:21:09.425 --> 01:21:10.793
You still don't know?

1004
01:21:16.066 --> 01:21:17.834
So what's the Hex?

1005
01:21:26.910 --> 01:21:28.411
We've all
heard the stories.

1006
01:21:38.454 --> 01:21:41.590
A cursed skydive?
Are you kidding me?

1007
01:21:45.494 --> 01:21:48.531
That seems like a bad idea.
but what do I know?

1008
01:21:50.633 --> 01:21:53.469
But I don't believe
in any stupid Hex curse.
Come on.

1009
01:22:01.744 --> 01:22:04.346
<i>You are not</i>
<i>where you think you are.</i>

1010
01:22:08.885 --> 01:22:13.489
<i>You will continue to slip</i>
<i>between this waking</i>
<i>nightmare...</i>

1011
01:22:13.589 --> 01:22:15.458
<i>...and reality...</i>

1012
01:22:17.593 --> 01:22:19.595
<i>...until you're dead.</i>

1013
01:22:52.195 --> 01:22:53.562
What'd you tell her?

1014
01:22:53.662 --> 01:22:55.932
I told her
if she wanted to survive.

1015
01:22:56.398 --> 01:22:58.768
she had to jump
with your altimeter.

1016
01:23:02.338 --> 01:23:05.541
Gullible.
Just like her dad.

1017
01:23:08.044 --> 01:23:09.311
And this thing's
not a toy.

1018
01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:13.049
How else are you gonna know
how many lives
you're workin' with?

1019
01:23:16.887 --> 01:23:20.556
That look on her face
was priceless. though.

1020
01:23:21.390 --> 01:23:23.894
You are one sadistic bastard.
do you know that?

1021
01:23:24.393 --> 01:23:26.395
You're definitely
goin' to hell.

1022
01:23:30.834 --> 01:23:32.969
And maybe
I can show you around.

1023
01:23:33.536 --> 01:23:35.771
Not anytime soon. Lanithro.
