Yeah.

21
00:02:16.653 --> 00:02:19.311
All right. I'll be right there.

22
00:02:21.244 --> 00:02:23.143
Mikey.

23
00:02:27.492 --> 00:02:30.115
So. uh. Mrs. Colefield says
that--

24
00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:32.152
- Alleges.
- Daisy.

25
00:02:32.255 --> 00:02:33.739
What? It's her
word against mine.

26
00:02:33.843 --> 00:02:35.638
Give it a rest. She hasn't
gotten five words out.

27
00:02:35.741 --> 00:02:37.502
And honestly. I don't think
we should be trusting a woman

28
00:02:37.605 --> 00:02:40.712
who uses the word "irregardless"
in a school setting.

29
00:02:40.815 --> 00:02:42.196
a professional educator.

30
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.751
Uh. she alleges
that Daisy pushed her.

31
00:02:45.855 --> 00:02:46.856
- Ow.
- That didn't hurt.

32
00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.064
You can't tell me what hurts.

33
00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:49.514
Pushed. as in?

34
00:02:49.617 --> 00:02:52.965
Physically. two hands.
in front of the class.

35
00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.278
- Is that true?
- No.

36
00:02:55.382 --> 00:02:58.661
I tried to go to the bathroom.
which is my human right.

37
00:02:58.764 --> 00:03:02.285
and she used her disgusting
body to block my way.

38
00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:04.943
Ask anyone in that
class. Ask Bailey.

39
00:03:05.046 --> 00:03:09.568
They'll all tell you that
I asked nicely three times.

40
00:03:09.672 --> 00:03:11.743
She actually said I couldn't go.

41
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.779
I mean. like. what?

42
00:03:13.883 --> 00:03:15.333
You just want me to pee right
here in this seat?

43
00:03:15.436 --> 00:03:17.507
- Okay.
- Are you gonna clean it up?

44
00:03:18.405 --> 00:03:20.165
And I didn't shove.

45
00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.616
Shoving is this. "Bitch. move."

46
00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:24.134
- Hey.
- Hey.

47
00:03:24.238 --> 00:03:26.620
I did this--

48
00:03:26.723 --> 00:03:30.589
"Will you move your
gross body. please?"

49
00:03:35.353 --> 00:03:36.768
Fuck this.

50
00:03:42.118 --> 00:03:43.878
Maria. I'm so sorry.

51
00:03:43.982 --> 00:03:45.535
So is she suspended or...

52
00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:48.400
For physically
assaulting a teacher.

53
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.852
it's a mandatory expulsion.

54
00:03:53.612 --> 00:03:55.373
I better check on her.

55
00:03:55.476 --> 00:03:58.238
No. I'll do it.
You stay.

56
00:04:02.138 --> 00:04:03.553
I'm sorry. Dan.

57
00:04:03.657 --> 00:04:07.385
I know you all have
a lot on your plate.

58
00:04:07.488 --> 00:04:12.148
Look. uh. i-is there
anything. anything we can do?

59
00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:17.291
Uh. community service.
letter of apology?

60
00:04:18.016 --> 00:04:19.189
Can I give you a kidney?

61
00:04:20.674 --> 00:04:22.986
It's just that St. Mary's
tuition is--

62
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.438
Maybe under the circumstances.

63
00:04:26.542 --> 00:04:28.647
I can try to talk
to Mrs. Colefield.

64
00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:32.996
and if she's amenable to it.
which I'm not sure she will be.

65
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.827
we might be able to
transmute Daisy's expulsion

66
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.484
to a two-week suspension.

67
00:04:37.587 --> 00:04:38.623
Oh. thank you so much.

68
00:04:38.726 --> 00:04:40.935
I haven't talked to her yet.

69
00:04:41.557 --> 00:04:44.629
Daisy has had plenty
of chances already.

70
00:04:45.457 --> 00:04:46.838
This is her last one.

71
00:04:48.322 --> 00:04:51.394
Did you reach out to the
therapist I recommended?

72
00:04:54.777 --> 00:04:58.159
I have
no idea what to do.

73
00:04:58.263 --> 00:04:59.920
Come on. get
out of the street.

74
00:05:00.023 --> 00:05:01.715
Are you kidding?

75
00:05:05.443 --> 00:05:08.066
Do we send her to one of
those military schools?

76
00:05:09.585 --> 00:05:12.484
I just hate the idea of
somebody screaming in her face.

77
00:05:14.003 --> 00:05:16.039
Maria said. if she
sees the counselor.

78
00:05:16.143 --> 00:05:18.110
she could just suspend her.

79
00:05:19.077 --> 00:05:21.735
Okay. then we gotta do that.

80
00:05:24.185 --> 00:05:25.842
How are we gonna do that?

81
00:05:31.538 --> 00:05:33.712
What are you doing?
- Hey.

82
00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:38.372
Whoo. whoo.

83
00:05:43.964 --> 00:05:44.999
Hey.

84
00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:50.522
Hey. hello.

plan to end this shit?

Uh. we go until 6:00.

87
00:05:57.598 --> 00:05:59.220
We can't hear ourselves think.

88
00:05:59.324 --> 00:06:01.878
It's-- It's not really
my call.

89
00:06:01.982 --> 00:06:04.294
Can you be quieter?

90
00:06:04.398 --> 00:06:06.676
Uh...

91
00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.438
I. uh. I d-- I--
I don't think so.

92
00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:13.027
That's just great.
So what are we gonna do now?

Uh. I need your
help with something.

179
00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.259
Shit.

180
00:13:36.263 --> 00:13:37.368
Come on.

181
00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:52.452
What-- What i-- What's--
What's this?

182
00:13:54.281 --> 00:13:55.938
Your salvation.

183
00:13:57.181 --> 00:13:59.424
I'm kidding.
We're rehearsing a play.

184
00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.289
Everyone. this is...

185
00:14:03.635 --> 00:14:04.913
Dan.

186
00:14:05.016 --> 00:14:06.915
Dan is the new Aaron.

187
00:14:07.018 --> 00:14:09.055
Everyone is replaceable.

188
00:14:09.158 --> 00:14:11.954
Here's a space.
dear heart. Come on.

189
00:14:12.058 --> 00:14:13.507
- Uh. no. I-I--
- Oh. come on.

190
00:14:13.611 --> 00:14:15.889
I'm not--
I-I don't-- I'm not an actor.

191
00:14:16.717 --> 00:14:18.616
Can you read?

192
00:14:18.719 --> 00:14:20.169
Did he audition?

193
00:14:20.273 --> 00:14:21.964
Do you have
a monologue we can see?

194
00:14:22.068 --> 00:14:23.724
Something classic?

195
00:14:23.828 --> 00:14:25.243
I should. uh--

196
00:14:25.347 --> 00:14:27.314
What?
Where do you have to be?

197
00:14:28.384 --> 00:14:30.835
Sit down and play
pretend for an hour.

198
00:14:30.939 --> 00:14:32.561
and then you can...
- Yeah.

199
00:14:32.664 --> 00:14:34.390
...go back to your life.

200
00:14:46.023 --> 00:14:48.059
Strike them down!
Beat them down!

201
00:14:48.163 --> 00:14:51.856
Part. fools.
Put up your swords.

202
00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.685
You know not what you do.

203
00:14:53.789 --> 00:14:55.653
Peace? I hate the word.

204
00:14:55.756 --> 00:14:57.275
That's cut. Lucian.
you know that.

205
00:14:57.379 --> 00:15:00.589
As I hate hell. all Montagues.

206
00:15:02.522 --> 00:15:04.731
- Aah!
- Ohh!

207
00:15:04.834 --> 00:15:07.113
And Capulet enters.

208
00:15:13.671 --> 00:15:14.844
That's your line.

209
00:15:14.948 --> 00:15:16.570
That's you.
- Oh.

210
00:15:18.987 --> 00:15:20.471
What noise--
- Louder.

211
00:15:20.574 --> 00:15:22.956
Remember. all the way
to the back of the house.

212
00:15:24.647 --> 00:15:26.235
What noise is this?

213
00:15:26.339 --> 00:15:28.858
Give me my long sword. ho.

214
00:15:28.962 --> 00:15:30.308
Okay.

215
00:15:31.792 --> 00:15:33.553
Seriously?

216
00:15:33.656 --> 00:15:39.593
Uh. the hardest part is
getting the first line out.

217
00:15:39.697 --> 00:15:41.492
After that. it's all downhill.

218
00:15:44.667 --> 00:15:46.773
- No phones. Jesus Christ.
- Phones on silent. please.

219
00:15:49.638 --> 00:15:51.191
- Hey. hun.
<i>- Hi. honey.</i>

220
00:15:51.295 --> 00:15:52.641
How'd it-- How'd it go?

221
00:15:52.744 --> 00:15:54.677
<i>Okay. just finished.</i>

222
00:15:54.781 --> 00:15:58.612
<i>Deposition date is set.
the 12th of next month.</i>

223
00:16:02.409 --> 00:16:04.170
<i>Are you there?</i>
- Yeah.

224
00:16:04.273 --> 00:16:06.586
Uh. that's great news.

225
00:16:06.689 --> 00:16:08.139
<i>Where are you?</i>

226
00:16:08.243 --> 00:16:10.038
Uh. I'm finishing
up at the site.

227
00:16:10.141 --> 00:16:12.523
Hey. are you in or out?

228
00:16:12.626 --> 00:16:14.145
<i>Is that Mikey?</i>

229
00:16:14.249 --> 00:16:17.597
Uh. I'll pick up some
champagne on the way home.

230
00:16:24.742 --> 00:16:27.503
And end of act two.

231
00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:30.644
God. how is there
still so much left?

232
00:16:30.748 --> 00:16:33.647
All right. act three tomorrow.
Everybody. please be on time.

233
00:16:33.751 --> 00:16:35.339
Welcome aboard. sir.

234
00:16:35.442 --> 00:16:37.617
- Good work today. Daniel.
- Uh. I'm not. uh. going--

235
00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.930
So rehearsal schedules. we
work. uh. evenings and weekends

236
00:16:41.034 --> 00:16:42.449
because everyone's
got real jobs.

237
00:16:42.553 --> 00:16:43.933
I hope they told
you it doesn't pay.

238
00:16:44.037 --> 00:16:45.073
- Well. I don't--
- Actually.

239
00:16:45.176 --> 00:16:46.557
it ends up being a loss.

240
00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.076
Do you have a family?
It's better if you don't.

241
00:16:48.179 --> 00:16:49.387
Just helping out for tonight.

242
00:16:49.491 --> 00:16:51.424
That's what I said
three years ago.

243
00:16:51.527 --> 00:16:53.840
Any interest in
running the light board?

244
00:16:53.943 --> 00:16:55.704
- Uh...
- Ah. had to ask.

245
00:16:55.807 --> 00:16:57.602
Good to meet you. Dave.
- Other people's props.

246
00:16:57.706 --> 00:16:59.535
It's just a plastic sword.
What am I--

247
00:16:59.639 --> 00:17:01.503
So what? It has nothing to do
with it being plastic.

248
00:17:01.606 --> 00:17:04.023
You're not supposed to
touch other people's props.

249
00:17:04.126 --> 00:17:05.369
You're not supposed to
play with the props.

250
00:17:05.472 --> 00:17:06.991
Okay. okay.

251
00:17:14.792 --> 00:17:17.381
Give me my long sword. ho.

252
00:17:23.318 --> 00:17:25.699
Give me my long sword. ho.

253
00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.288
Ho. ho.

254
00:17:29.841 --> 00:17:32.223
Ho-ho.

255
00:17:35.882 --> 00:17:38.195
- Want more?
- No. this is gross.

256
00:17:38.298 --> 00:17:40.093
I don't even know
how anyone eats it.

257
00:17:40.197 --> 00:17:44.097
Jim said-- he said we need
a few prep meetings

258
00:17:44.201 --> 00:17:45.961
before the actual deposition

259
00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:48.895
to go over any questions
they might ask.

260
00:17:48.998 --> 00:17:51.208
Do I get to testify?

261
00:17:51.311 --> 00:17:53.106
They're gonna depose all of us.

262
00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:54.452
- Hell. yeah.
- You shouldn't have

263
00:17:54.556 --> 00:17:56.109
to say anything.
- Look. look. look.

264
00:17:56.213 --> 00:17:57.593
All we need to do is
just tell the truth.

265
00:17:57.697 --> 00:17:59.906
I can't wait.
I'm so fucking ready.

266
00:18:00.009 --> 00:18:02.150
- Hey.
- Hey. come on.

267
00:18:02.253 --> 00:18:03.875
That's it. You're--
You're grounded.

268
00:18:03.979 --> 00:18:05.256
I'm already grounded.

269
00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.086
Then you're grounded
till you're 18.

270
00:18:08.501 --> 00:18:10.330
Can I get a pant suit?

271
00:18:10.434 --> 00:18:13.299
I don't think I have anything
really courtroom appropriate.

272
00:18:13.402 --> 00:18:15.680
What about the
dress you wore to GG's funeral?

273
00:18:15.784 --> 00:18:18.994
No. that just screams
bereaved little girl.

274
00:18:19.098 --> 00:18:21.030
not power bitch.

275
00:18:21.134 --> 00:18:22.687
- Oh. oh. come on.
- Hey. hey. hey.

276
00:18:22.791 --> 00:18:24.655
Come on. come on.

277
00:18:24.758 --> 00:18:26.795
I just wanted a sip.

278
00:18:29.211 --> 00:18:31.800
I'm gonna say it
all right to her.

279
00:18:31.903 --> 00:18:34.285
like. "That's it. look at me."

280
00:18:40.602 --> 00:18:41.637
<i>Okay. honey.</i>

281
00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.157
Come in.

282
00:18:44.261 --> 00:18:46.642
- Night. honey.
- Night.

283
00:18:50.577 --> 00:18:55.306
Hey. uh. do you know this
play. "Romeo and Juliet"?

284
00:18:56.376 --> 00:18:58.551
Two households
both alike in dignity

285
00:18:58.654 --> 00:19:01.278
in fair Verona where
we lay our scene

286
00:19:01.381 --> 00:19:03.659
from ancient grudge
break new mutiny

287
00:19:03.763 --> 00:19:06.628
where civil blood makes
civil hands unclean.

288
00:19:06.731 --> 00:19:09.527
From forth the fatal
loins of these two foes.

289
00:19:09.631 --> 00:19:13.152
a pair of star-crossed
lovers take their life

290
00:19:13.255 --> 00:19:15.637
whose misadventured
piteous overthrows

291
00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:19.986
doth. with their death.
bury their parents' strife.

292
00:19:20.089 --> 00:19:21.436
Whew. whoa.

293
00:19:21.539 --> 00:19:23.023
We had to learn
it for AP English.

294
00:19:23.127 --> 00:19:25.923
Well. uh. I--
I've never seen it.

295
00:19:26.026 --> 00:19:28.857
Seriously?
The movie's a classic.

296
00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.824
It's old. but you
know. it's good.

297
00:19:39.902 --> 00:19:43.492
Leonardo DiCaprio does not
look like that anymore.

298
00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:53.744
Hmm. they're so young.

299
00:19:53.847 --> 00:19:56.298
They're. like. my age.

300
00:19:56.402 --> 00:19:59.853
<i>♪ Missing you</i>

301
00:19:59.957 --> 00:20:02.718
<i>♪ Oh</i>

302
00:20:06.895 --> 00:20:07.930
Hey.

303
00:20:10.312 --> 00:20:12.935
I told you he was a narcissist.

304
00:20:14.661 --> 00:20:15.869
Dad.

305
00:20:15.973 --> 00:20:17.802
He's probably a sociopath.

306
00:20:17.906 --> 00:20:20.391
He. like. never yawns
when anyone else does.

307
00:20:22.945 --> 00:20:25.569
What happens to them?

308
00:20:25.672 --> 00:20:27.053
You don't know?

309
00:20:27.156 --> 00:20:29.331
I know they get together.

310
00:20:29.435 --> 00:20:31.885
I just told you
in the prologue.

311
00:20:31.989 --> 00:20:33.922
Here's a hint.

312
00:20:34.025 --> 00:20:35.475
It's a tragedy.

313
00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:42.931
Oh. yeah. a really
high percentage. too.

314
00:20:43.034 --> 00:20:45.036
like one in 10 people you know.

315
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:53.459
Can you put that
on silent. please?

316
00:20:53.562 --> 00:20:55.633
I don't know how.

317
00:21:02.088 --> 00:21:04.504
Dad. this place is for kids.

318
00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.853
Daisy. please come in.

319
00:21:12.961 --> 00:21:15.239
Uh. am I supposed
to go in there or something?

320
00:21:15.343 --> 00:21:18.656
Some parents choose to.
It's really up to you.

321
00:21:20.934 --> 00:21:23.040
I'll be back in an hour.

322
00:22:17.784 --> 00:22:22.410
It's just like the island
of misfit toys. right?

323
00:22:22.513 --> 00:22:24.170
Shake it. shake it. shake
it. shake it. shake it.

324
00:22:24.273 --> 00:22:26.103
shake it. shake it.

325
00:22:26.206 --> 00:22:28.830
They're good people. really.
I'm the only asshole.

326
00:22:30.176 --> 00:22:32.143
You don't seem
like an asshole.

327
00:22:32.247 --> 00:22:33.904
See. you are a good actor.

328
00:22:34.007 --> 00:22:35.388
I almost believed that.

329
00:22:37.252 --> 00:22:39.323
Uh. how. uh. long

330
00:22:39.427 --> 00:22:43.154
have you all been doing skits?

331
00:22:43.258 --> 00:22:44.742
A few years.

332
00:22:44.846 --> 00:22:46.434
I used to do this professionally.

333
00:22:46.537 --> 00:22:49.368
but when I moved home.
I didn't wanna stop.

334
00:22:54.476 --> 00:22:56.720
It's not all just
Shakespeare. you know.

335
00:22:59.688 --> 00:23:02.139
Well. uh. good luck.

336
00:23:06.385 --> 00:23:10.734
Hey. Dan. you know
why I asked you to help?

337
00:23:12.011 --> 00:23:14.496
'Cause I can read.

338
00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:19.432
It seemed like you
might want a chance

339
00:23:19.536 --> 00:23:24.679
of being somebody
else for a while.

340
00:23:45.458 --> 00:23:46.804
How'd it go?

341
00:23:46.908 --> 00:23:48.496
She said that we
could just sit there

342
00:23:48.599 --> 00:23:51.050
for. like. a whole hour
in silence if I wanted.

343
00:23:51.153 --> 00:23:54.502
I bet no one's ever
actually done that before.

344
00:23:54.605 --> 00:23:56.365
Look. next time
you have to talk.

345
00:23:56.469 --> 00:23:57.850
No. I don't.

346
00:23:57.953 --> 00:23:59.334
Yeah. uh. we're
paying 150 a session.

347
00:23:59.438 --> 00:24:00.680
- You are?
- Yes.

348
00:24:00.784 --> 00:24:03.027
- Well. stop doing that.
- We can't.

349
00:24:04.408 --> 00:24:06.617
Well. I think it's
a bad investment.

350
00:24:08.654 --> 00:24:10.587
Oh. I drew you something.

351
00:24:28.294 --> 00:24:30.020
You know my friend. Anastasia?

352
00:24:30.123 --> 00:24:32.850
Her whole family goes
to family therapy.

353
00:24:34.438 --> 00:24:36.716
She says it's
mortifying. but it helps.

354
00:24:38.131 --> 00:24:39.892
She says that they
all go as a group.

355
00:24:39.995 --> 00:24:42.722
and they all talk about
their feelings together.

356
00:24:43.896 --> 00:24:46.554
Because she's not
the only problem.

357
00:24:56.771 --> 00:24:59.118
What is she doing?

358
00:25:02.397 --> 00:25:04.123
Dad?

359
00:25:08.955 --> 00:25:10.094
Dad.

360
00:25:13.546 --> 00:25:15.652
What is this?
What are you doing?

361
00:25:15.755 --> 00:25:18.344
They had an end-of-season
sale at Home Depot.

362
00:25:18.447 --> 00:25:19.897
I thought a garden
would be nice.

363
00:25:20.001 --> 00:25:21.830
Well. you can't plant
anything in there now.

364
00:25:21.934 --> 00:25:24.074
It-- I-I-It'll
frost over in a month.

365
00:25:24.177 --> 00:25:26.525
So we'll have
a nice yard for a month.

366
00:25:26.628 --> 00:25:28.665
No. no. no. no. no. no.
no. we're not doing this.

367
00:25:28.768 --> 00:25:30.943
- Dan.
- Nah. ya didn't ask.

368
00:25:31.046 --> 00:25:32.531
I didn't know I
needed your permission.

369
00:25:32.634 --> 00:25:34.222
- Yeah.
- Dad. no. I think this is nice.

370
00:25:34.325 --> 00:25:35.844
- No.
- Mom. this is cool.

371
00:25:35.948 --> 00:25:39.607
You know. I-- I don't like to
look at it all the time.

372
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:41.712
Think if we plant some
wildflowers or something-

373
00:25:41.816 --> 00:25:43.956
- Get the fuck outta there!
- Dan!

374
00:25:47.684 --> 00:25:49.306
Oh. so you're just leaving?

375
00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:52.240
Honey. it's okay.

376
00:25:52.343 --> 00:25:54.138
No. none of this is okay!

377
00:25:54.242 --> 00:25:56.658
Daisy.

378
00:26:01.767 --> 00:26:03.527
Put your
hand on your diaphragm

379
00:26:03.631 --> 00:26:05.598
and feel yourself
expand with breath.

380
00:26:10.741 --> 00:26:13.641
Dan. welcome.

381
00:26:14.711 --> 00:26:17.299
Why didn't you lie down?
We're doing breathing.

382
00:26:18.231 --> 00:26:21.234
- Breathing.
- Yeah.

383
00:26:50.194 --> 00:26:51.886
And inhale.

384
00:26:54.336 --> 00:26:56.684
And on the exhale. we're
gonna just let it all go

385
00:26:56.787 --> 00:26:58.513
on one big. shared sigh.

386
00:26:58.617 --> 00:27:00.515
Here we go.

387
00:27:11.146 --> 00:27:14.563
All right. just
dance. just dance.

388
00:27:14.667 --> 00:27:16.048
Don't care how you look.

389
00:27:16.151 --> 00:27:19.120
Just look silly. look
sexy. look stupid.

390
00:27:19.223 --> 00:27:20.708
Who cares?

391
00:27:20.811 --> 00:27:22.606
Just use your body to
express how ya feel.

Part of our job as actors
is emotional intelligence.

413
00:28:21.769 --> 00:28:25.393
to be able to recognize
what others feel.

414
00:28:25.496 --> 00:28:27.015
to have that affect us.

415
00:28:27.119 --> 00:28:30.018
and to be able to express
our own emotions. okay?

416
00:28:30.122 --> 00:28:33.539
So this exercise is called
provocative questions.

417
00:28:33.642 --> 00:28:34.989
Oh. I love this one.

418
00:28:35.092 --> 00:28:37.474
And I'm going to
need two volunteers.

419
00:28:38.475 --> 00:28:42.203
Lucian and... Dan.

420
00:28:44.653 --> 00:28:47.277
Please stand here
and face your partner.

421
00:28:51.833 --> 00:28:56.700
Okay. so your partner
is your lifeline.

422
00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:00.014
They are your oxygen.
and no one else exists.

423
00:29:00.117 --> 00:29:02.326
Don't look at me.
- Don't look at her.

424
00:29:04.432 --> 00:29:07.090
All right. so. Dan.
you're going to start

425
00:29:07.193 --> 00:29:09.092
by asking Lucian a question

426
00:29:09.195 --> 00:29:11.163
that you could never
ask him in real life.

427
00:29:11.266 --> 00:29:15.029
something intentionally
provocative. okay?

428
00:29:15.132 --> 00:29:17.790
And when you see
an emotional rise in him.

429
00:29:17.894 --> 00:29:21.863
you articulate it by
telling him what you see.

430
00:29:23.658 --> 00:29:24.935
Like?

431
00:29:26.005 --> 00:29:29.768
Like. "You're
angry." if he's angry.

432
00:29:30.492 --> 00:29:31.700
Clear?
- I can take it.

433
00:29:31.804 --> 00:29:33.081
You can really hit me.

434
00:29:33.185 --> 00:29:34.634
- I-I-I don't know.
- Don't look at me. okay?

435
00:29:34.738 --> 00:29:37.258
- Don't look at her. Look at me.
- Okay.

436
00:29:37.361 --> 00:29:41.365
So. many of us live our lives
repressing our emotions

437
00:29:41.469 --> 00:29:44.230
because out there.
they can be a liability.

438
00:29:44.334 --> 00:29:46.094
But in here. we are
in a safe space.

439
00:29:46.198 --> 00:29:49.132
And we can put those
emotions into good use.

440
00:29:49.235 --> 00:29:50.719
So I ask...

441
00:29:50.823 --> 00:29:52.514
A provocative question.

442
00:29:53.999 --> 00:29:58.417
Um. you like Michael Jordan?

443
00:30:00.868 --> 00:30:03.180
- What do I--
- His emotion.

444
00:30:03.284 --> 00:30:04.733
- I don't know.
- Disappointed.

445
00:30:04.837 --> 00:30:06.218
I was disappointed.
- Here. okay.

446
00:30:06.321 --> 00:30:07.944
- I saw that.
- Okay. okay. um. ensemble.

447
00:30:08.047 --> 00:30:10.498
was that a brave.
provocative question?

448
00:30:10.601 --> 00:30:13.950
- No. no. no. no.
- Weak. weak.

449
00:30:14.053 --> 00:30:16.055
Okay. Lucian.
it's your turn.

450
00:30:16.159 --> 00:30:17.436
Yeah.

451
00:30:19.369 --> 00:30:21.026
When you masturbate.
do you fantasize

452
00:30:21.129 --> 00:30:22.613
about having your nipples
chewed until they bleed?

453
00:30:22.717 --> 00:30:23.994
What? No!
What--

454
00:30:24.098 --> 00:30:25.340
- Don't answer.
- He's embarrassed.

455
00:30:25.444 --> 00:30:26.825
- Don't answer.
- He's embarrassed.

456
00:30:26.928 --> 00:30:29.068
Dan. repeat.
"I'm embarrassed."

457
00:30:29.758 --> 00:30:31.899
I'm embarrassed.

458
00:30:32.002 --> 00:30:33.279
There you go.

459
00:30:33.383 --> 00:30:37.318
Hey. yeah.

460
00:30:37.421 --> 00:30:40.010
Now we're gonna
go a little deeper.

461
00:30:40.562 --> 00:30:45.533
Lucian. I want you to ask Dan
something more vulnerable.

462
00:30:45.636 --> 00:30:46.914
Hmm.

463
00:30:54.438 --> 00:30:55.992
Are you lonely?

464
00:30:57.614 --> 00:30:59.064
You're surprised.

465
00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.343
Repeat.

466
00:31:03.654 --> 00:31:05.725
I'm surprised.

467
00:31:05.829 --> 00:31:07.141
See that?

468
00:31:07.244 --> 00:31:08.590
See that? That's the truth.

469
00:31:08.694 --> 00:31:09.764
Yep.

470
00:31:09.868 --> 00:31:11.973
- Yes.
- Whoo!

471
00:31:12.077 --> 00:31:13.664
Give it up.

472
00:31:29.888 --> 00:31:31.303
Daisy.

473
00:31:31.406 --> 00:31:32.994
Go away.

474
00:31:33.098 --> 00:31:35.686
Wanna bust some balls?

475
00:31:40.864 --> 00:31:42.314
- Oh. word.
- That's a homer.

476
00:31:42.417 --> 00:31:44.903
Yeah. that is. Where'd it go?

477
00:31:48.251 --> 00:31:51.012
That one's right
behind ya still.

478
00:31:51.116 --> 00:31:52.876
Ooh. a swing and a miss.

479
00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:54.429
- All right. you don't--
- All right.

480
00:31:54.533 --> 00:31:56.949
Uh. just. uh. stand
your ground like this.

481
00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:03.128
That's it. There ya go.

482
00:32:07.995 --> 00:32:09.893
What?

483
00:32:09.997 --> 00:32:12.896
- You're happy.
- Okay. weirdo.

484
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.243
- Again?
- Yeah.

485
00:32:15.347 --> 00:32:17.452
Let's go at the same time.
- All right.

486
00:32:21.077 --> 00:32:22.526
I should have said you
only have to dress up

487
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:23.942
for the actual deposition.

488
00:32:24.045 --> 00:32:25.012
- Told you.
- It's okay.

489
00:32:25.115 --> 00:32:27.704
Uh. it's casual Friday.

490
00:32:27.807 --> 00:32:29.844
My wife is obsessed

491
00:32:29.948 --> 00:32:34.090
with this. um.
um. makeover show.

492
00:32:34.193 --> 00:32:38.646
Okay. so. um. how this will work

493
00:32:38.749 --> 00:32:42.581
is. uh. we'll go over what
to expect at the deposition.

494
00:32:42.684 --> 00:32:44.790
um. procedures. et cetera.

495
00:32:44.893 --> 00:32:47.275
And. uh. we'll also practice
me asking you questions

496
00:32:47.379 --> 00:32:49.519
so you'll be more
comfortable on the day.

497
00:32:49.622 --> 00:32:50.899
Uh. hopefully.
we'll only need. uh.

498
00:32:51.003 --> 00:32:52.418
one or two of these meetings.

499
00:32:52.522 --> 00:32:54.179
I know we wanna keep
billable hours low.

500
00:32:54.282 --> 00:32:56.077
And I'm not a cheap date.

501
00:32:57.492 --> 00:33:00.599
Is she gonna be
there. Christine?

502
00:33:00.702 --> 00:33:01.945
Uh. we don't know.

503
00:33:02.049 --> 00:33:03.326
Uh. Illinois code
of civil procedure

504
00:33:03.429 --> 00:33:05.155
doesn't prohibit
her from attending.

505
00:33:05.259 --> 00:33:08.365
Uh. if she does opt to
join. it's-- it's likely

506
00:33:08.469 --> 00:33:10.540
that her parents
will be there. too.

507
00:33:13.474 --> 00:33:15.096
Okey dokey then.

508
00:33:19.238 --> 00:33:21.102
How has this time been for you?

509
00:33:21.861 --> 00:33:25.037
It's been... difficult.

510
00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:28.006
More than difficult.

511
00:33:31.043 --> 00:33:35.599
I know it's impossible. but
I just want my family back.

512
00:33:39.638 --> 00:33:41.812
That's all. Mrs. Mueller.
thank you.

513
00:33:43.987 --> 00:33:46.403
And that's it.
Fantastic. really nice.

514
00:33:46.507 --> 00:33:48.509
It was clear. uh. non-combative.

515
00:33:48.612 --> 00:33:51.305
emotional undercurrent
but in a controlled way.

516
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:54.239
I'm exhausted.

517
00:33:54.342 --> 00:33:55.895
Who wants to go next?

518
00:33:55.999 --> 00:33:58.346
Daisy. all right.

519
00:33:58.450 --> 00:33:59.796
Okay.

520
00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:03.765
Uh. Daisy.
can you tell me.

521
00:34:03.869 --> 00:34:06.699
when did you first meet
Christine Hawthorne?

522
00:34:06.803 --> 00:34:08.149
It was at Thanksgiving.

523
00:34:08.253 --> 00:34:09.771
She had dinner with us.

524
00:34:09.875 --> 00:34:12.084
And what was her
relationship with your brother?

525
00:34:12.188 --> 00:34:14.949
They were coupled
in a romantic fashion.

526
00:34:15.053 --> 00:34:19.264
- Simpler.
- Um. she was his girlfriend.

527
00:34:19.367 --> 00:34:21.473
Uh. um.

528
00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:23.958
Yeah. uh. keep going.

529
00:34:24.062 --> 00:34:25.994
I just have to pee.

530
00:34:47.671 --> 00:34:49.432
- Rude as fuck!
- It doesn't matter.

531
00:34:49.535 --> 00:34:51.054
If you become aggressive--
- No. what are you even on about?

532
00:34:51.158 --> 00:34:52.400
That was so rude.
- Daisy.

533
00:34:52.504 --> 00:34:53.988
I'm not being aggressive
to you.

534
00:34:54.092 --> 00:34:55.541
Hey. what happened?

535
00:34:55.645 --> 00:34:57.267
He's making it seem like
it's all Brian's fault.

536
00:34:57.371 --> 00:34:59.166
That's what their
defense attorney's gonna do.

537
00:34:59.269 --> 00:35:00.719
They're gonna try
to throw you off.

538
00:35:00.822 --> 00:35:02.583
If you become combative--
- You're being combative.

539
00:35:02.686 --> 00:35:03.963
- This is we're practicing.
- I'm not being defensive!

540
00:35:04.067 --> 00:35:05.482
Daisy.

541
00:35:05.586 --> 00:35:07.139
You need to get used
to keeping your cool.

542
00:35:07.243 --> 00:35:09.072
I can't be a robot
when I talk about this.

543
00:35:09.176 --> 00:35:11.247
I don't know how you two can.

544
00:35:20.152 --> 00:35:22.085
Should we. uh.
pause for the day?

545
00:35:22.189 --> 00:35:24.329
We're paying for the hour.

546
00:35:24.432 --> 00:35:26.365
We should use the time.

547
00:35:26.469 --> 00:35:27.504
Dan?

548
00:35:37.618 --> 00:35:39.344
Okay. so--
- I-I-I think

549
00:35:39.447 --> 00:35:42.519
we should stop for Daisy.

550
00:35:46.696 --> 00:35:49.043
If I profane with
my unworthiest hand

551
00:35:49.147 --> 00:35:52.702
this holy shrine.
the gentle sin is this.

552
00:35:52.805 --> 00:35:55.567
And. Tyler.
reach out your hand to her.

553
00:35:58.708 --> 00:36:02.401
My lips. two
blushing pilgrims.

554
00:36:02.505 --> 00:36:06.888
ready stand to smooth that
rough touch with a tender kiss.

555
00:36:09.408 --> 00:36:12.756
Um. sorry. I-- I can smell
cigarettes on your breath.

556
00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:15.414
I'm just-- I'm very allergic.
- To smells?

557
00:36:15.518 --> 00:36:18.106
Uh. just keep. Rita. please.

558
00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:28.289
Good pilgrim. you do
wrong your hand too much.

559
00:36:28.393 --> 00:36:30.222
Isn't the language gorgeous?

560
00:36:30.326 --> 00:36:32.535
Yeah. I just wish
I knew what it meant.

561
00:36:32.638 --> 00:36:33.501
Me. too.

562
00:36:35.503 --> 00:36:38.092
For saints have hands that
pilgrims' hands do touch.

563
00:36:38.196 --> 00:36:40.922
and palm to palm is
holy palmers' kiss.

564
00:36:41.026 --> 00:36:45.203
Saints do not move. though
grant for prayer's sake.

565
00:36:45.306 --> 00:36:48.413
Then move not. while
my prayers effect I take.

566
00:36:48.516 --> 00:36:50.829
And this is when you kiss.

567
00:36:54.902 --> 00:36:56.835
I'm sorry. are we gonna
have an intimacy coordinator?

568
00:36:58.354 --> 00:37:00.425
We always had one at ISU.
- Intimacy what?

569
00:37:00.528 --> 00:37:02.185
It-- It. uh. it's-- it's
like a fight choreographer

570
00:37:02.289 --> 00:37:03.600
but for physical intimacy.

571
00:37:03.704 --> 00:37:05.084
- Never heard of it.
- Not surprising.

572
00:37:05.188 --> 00:37:06.672
I read about it
in "The Times."

573
00:37:06.776 --> 00:37:08.674
We don't need it. We can
figure it out ourselves.

574
00:37:08.778 --> 00:37:10.814
Well. it's-- it's
industry standard.

575
00:37:10.918 --> 00:37:12.885
maybe not when you were
acting professionally.

576
00:37:12.989 --> 00:37:14.577
Are we gonna get a
fight choreographer?

577
00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:15.716
- No.
- No.

578
00:37:16.682 --> 00:37:18.408
The audience lives through us.

579
00:37:18.512 --> 00:37:20.410
We owe them something real.

580
00:37:21.515 --> 00:37:23.758
I'm not doing that.

581
00:37:23.862 --> 00:37:25.381
Also...

582
00:37:26.174 --> 00:37:28.936
Look. go ahead. Tyler.

583
00:37:29.488 --> 00:37:32.250
Whatever you have to say.
this is a safe space.

584
00:37:32.353 --> 00:37:34.355
I think the age difference
is a problem here.

585
00:37:34.459 --> 00:37:36.046
Does anybody else
think it's weird

586
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:38.290
that Juliet is my mom's age?

587
00:37:38.394 --> 00:37:40.568
R and J are supposed
to be young.

588
00:37:40.672 --> 00:37:43.053
That's the point.
- Tyler.

589
00:37:43.157 --> 00:37:44.814
This is our cast.

590
00:37:44.917 --> 00:37:46.781
This is who auditioned.

591
00:37:46.885 --> 00:37:51.234
And Rita got the role because
she was excellent in her read.

592
00:37:51.338 --> 00:37:54.341
She's a very skilled
and accomplished actor.

593
00:37:54.444 --> 00:37:56.964
Who is too old for the part.

594
00:37:57.896 --> 00:37:59.346
I'm not being a dick.

595
00:37:59.449 --> 00:38:01.934
Kids are. like. impulsive.

596
00:38:02.038 --> 00:38:06.767
It's just not the same
story if Juliet's...

597
00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:08.734
50.

598
00:38:08.838 --> 00:38:12.428
I thought we were supposed
to be honest in here.

599
00:38:25.199 --> 00:38:26.269
Ohh!
- Rita.

600
00:38:26.373 --> 00:38:29.307
- Oh.
- Oh. my God! Ah!

601
00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:30.653
- Damn it.
- Ah!

602
00:38:30.756 --> 00:38:33.103
Oh. Tyler.
Tyler. oh. shit.

603
00:38:33.207 --> 00:38:35.140
I am so. so sorry.

604
00:38:35.243 --> 00:38:38.005
This will not happen
again... probably.

605
00:38:38.108 --> 00:38:39.386
Drama.

606
00:38:42.216 --> 00:38:44.667
How's the hand?

607
00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:46.669
Do you know that.
when was young.

608
00:38:46.772 --> 00:38:49.637
we had to make out in auditions?

609
00:38:50.673 --> 00:38:52.364
You don't know how
many older actors stuck

610
00:38:52.468 --> 00:38:54.780
their filthy tongues
down my throat.

611
00:38:55.816 --> 00:38:57.921
And not even on
stage always either.

612
00:39:04.272 --> 00:39:06.723
I'm old school.
- Me. too.

613
00:39:07.724 --> 00:39:08.794
And old.

614
00:39:10.244 --> 00:39:11.521
Me. too.

615
00:39:14.421 --> 00:39:17.216
I've wanted to play
Juliet my whole life.

616
00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:23.533
but I was-- I was
never delicate enough.

617
00:39:23.637 --> 00:39:26.640
never light enough.

618
00:39:26.743 --> 00:39:30.678
Well. it's all pretend anyway. right?

619
00:39:31.403 --> 00:39:34.993
Besides. you're good.

620
00:39:38.514 --> 00:39:39.929
- Tyler.
- No.

621
00:39:40.999 --> 00:39:43.104
I have an agent.

622
00:39:47.212 --> 00:39:50.180
Rita. may I speak with you?

623
00:40:04.988 --> 00:40:08.060
Hey. uh. let me
ask you something.

624
00:40:08.164 --> 00:40:12.996
How'd you memorize all those
lines for the school plays?

625
00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:14.826
And you never seem
stressed about it.

626
00:40:14.929 --> 00:40:16.621
Dad. asking an actor how
they memorized lines is.

627
00:40:16.724 --> 00:40:19.313
like. the most basic question.

628
00:40:19.417 --> 00:40:21.004
The lines are the easy part.

629
00:40:21.108 --> 00:40:23.800
The hard part is
the emotional journey.

630
00:40:23.904 --> 00:40:26.320
living truthfully in
imaginary circumstances.

631
00:40:26.424 --> 00:40:27.873
blah. blah. blah.

632
00:40:30.497 --> 00:40:32.740
It's easier if it has a rhythm.

633
00:40:32.844 --> 00:40:35.053
Then. you can think
of 'em like a song.

634
00:40:35.881 --> 00:40:38.677
And Shakespeare has a rhythm?

635
00:40:38.781 --> 00:40:41.473
Ba. da. ba. da.
ba. da. ba. da.

636
00:40:41.577 --> 00:40:45.512
"Two houses both alike
in dignity"-- easy.

637
00:40:46.409 --> 00:40:47.893
Huh.

638
00:40:49.516 --> 00:40:52.208
Ba. da. ba. da. ba. da. ba. da.

639
00:40:54.279 --> 00:40:55.694
Hey. Mike.
- What's up?

640
00:40:55.798 --> 00:40:58.041
Not that she would.
but if Sharon asks.

641
00:40:58.145 --> 00:41:01.942
can you say we. uh. grabbed
a beer tonight together?

642
00:41:02.045 --> 00:41:05.842
Uh. the-- the lawyer wants
to go over my testimony.

643
00:41:05.946 --> 00:41:08.155
and. uh. I don't wanna tell her

644
00:41:08.258 --> 00:41:12.366
'cause it's more billable hours.

645
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:14.299
Oh. where is Romeo?

646
00:41:14.402 --> 00:41:16.646
Saw you him today?

647
00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:19.856
Right glad I am he
was not at this fray.

648
00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:23.101
Madam. an hour
before the worshiped sun--

649
00:41:23.204 --> 00:41:24.551
Oh. wait. hold.

650
00:41:24.654 --> 00:41:26.518
Oh. this isn't gonna work.

651
00:41:26.622 --> 00:41:29.003
Lucian. you can't be
Romeo and Benvolio.

652
00:41:29.107 --> 00:41:30.729
You can't do scenes
with your son.

653
00:41:30.833 --> 00:41:32.455
No. no. I have
a plan for that.

654
00:41:32.559 --> 00:41:34.906
Just...
Good morrow. cousin.

655
00:41:35.803 --> 00:41:37.287
Is the day so young?
- No.

656
00:41:37.391 --> 00:41:38.737
Can I have a hat. too?

657
00:41:42.845 --> 00:41:45.399
- Silence in the house.
- Line.

658
00:41:45.503 --> 00:41:48.333
Damn. I was in flow.
- Just stay in it.

659
00:41:48.436 --> 00:41:49.852
Line.

660
00:41:49.955 --> 00:41:52.613
Was that my father
that went hence so fast?

661
00:41:57.169 --> 00:42:00.241
Was that my father
that went hence so fast?

662
00:42:01.277 --> 00:42:04.556
Lady. lady.

663
00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:07.317
oh. alas. alas.

664
00:42:07.421 --> 00:42:09.837
Help. help. my lady's dead.

665
00:42:09.941 --> 00:42:12.460
O. lamentable day.
- What is the matter?

666
00:42:12.564 --> 00:42:15.602
O. tired day.

667
00:42:15.705 --> 00:42:19.502
O. me. o. me. my child.

668
00:42:19.606 --> 00:42:24.196
my only child. revive. look up.

669
00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:26.820
or I will die with thee.

670
00:42:26.923 --> 00:42:28.269
Okay.

671
00:42:30.824 --> 00:42:33.274
Dan. that's you.
- Sorry.

672
00:42:36.312 --> 00:42:37.727
Ha. let me see her out.

673
00:42:37.831 --> 00:42:39.971
Alas. she's cold.

674
00:42:40.074 --> 00:42:42.870
Her blood is settled.
and her joints are stiff.

675
00:42:42.974 --> 00:42:45.942
Life and these lips
have long been separate--

676
00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.568
- ...ted
- ...ted. ted.

677
00:42:52.086 --> 00:42:54.054
Death lies on her
like an untimely frost

678
00:42:54.157 --> 00:42:55.780
upon the sweetest flower...
- Oh.

679
00:42:55.883 --> 00:42:57.713
- ...in all the fields.
- Oh. lamentable day.

680
00:42:57.816 --> 00:42:59.473
Oh. woeful time.

681
00:42:59.577 --> 00:43:01.164
Greg. stop cutting me off.

682
00:43:01.268 --> 00:43:05.272
Death. that hath ta'en
her hence to make me well.

683
00:43:05.375 --> 00:43:07.999
ties up my tongue and
will not let me speak.

684
00:43:09.794 --> 00:43:11.243
Okay. let's hold there.

685
00:43:12.072 --> 00:43:14.212
You've really found the rhythm.

686
00:43:14.937 --> 00:43:18.043
Well. it-- it-- it helps if
you learn it like a song.

687
00:43:18.147 --> 00:43:22.323
Okay. but now let's
make it real. okay?

688
00:43:22.427 --> 00:43:24.015
Come here.

689
00:43:26.673 --> 00:43:28.606
Do you have kids?

690
00:43:28.709 --> 00:43:30.159
How many?

691
00:43:30.262 --> 00:43:32.057
- Two.
- Perfect.

692
00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:36.752
I want you to imagine--
close your eyes...

693
00:43:38.305 --> 00:43:41.895
...finding your child dead.

694
00:43:43.137 --> 00:43:46.900
You see their body.
and it's them but not.

695
00:43:47.003 --> 00:43:49.903
You touch their
skin. and it's cold.

696
00:43:50.006 --> 00:43:53.354
You try to shake them awake.
and their limbs are stiff.

697
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:56.564
It's-- It's like a nightmare.

698
00:43:56.668 --> 00:43:59.602
You wanna wake up.
but you can't.

699
00:43:59.706 --> 00:44:01.949
Can you imagine that?

700
00:44:05.677 --> 00:44:07.265
Fantastic. great.

701
00:44:07.368 --> 00:44:10.026
All right. we'll hit this
again tomorrow. all right?

702
00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:12.788
Okay. everybody. I wanna. uh.
go back to the Paris scene.

703
00:44:12.891 --> 00:44:14.168
I wanna cut it.

704
00:44:14.272 --> 00:44:15.687
- No.
- Lucian. Lucian.

705
00:44:15.791 --> 00:44:17.068
if you're so invested
in Paris. you know what?

706
00:44:17.171 --> 00:44:18.794
You can do it in
the wings during--

707
00:44:18.897 --> 00:44:20.243
You're really gonna cut Paris
from the show?

708
00:44:20.347 --> 00:44:21.969
- Yes. I'm going. I'm going--
- No. like--

709
00:44:22.073 --> 00:44:23.591
- Nobody cares about it.
- I-- I care about Paris.

710
00:44:23.695 --> 00:44:25.455
Just let it go.

711
00:44:28.251 --> 00:44:30.357
Honey?

712
00:45:11.605 --> 00:45:14.297
Come on in. Daisy.

713
00:45:17.887 --> 00:45:20.718
Dan. why don't you join us. too?

714
00:45:23.548 --> 00:45:27.690
Daisy asked if we could meet
together. the three of us.

715
00:45:27.794 --> 00:45:29.485
I thought that was a great idea.

716
00:45:29.588 --> 00:45:31.176
Is that okay with you. Dan?

717
00:45:34.421 --> 00:45:37.838
So. last week. we spent most

718
00:45:37.942 --> 00:45:40.185
of our session
talking about Brian.

719
00:45:41.359 --> 00:45:44.638
It's a terrible thing

720
00:45:44.742 --> 00:45:47.192
for a family to
have to experience.

721
00:45:47.296 --> 00:45:49.781
- My dad won't talk about it.
- That's not true.

722
00:45:50.644 --> 00:45:52.473
Uh. it's not good to dwell.

723
00:45:52.577 --> 00:45:55.131
That's what Daisy
said at first.

724
00:45:55.235 --> 00:45:58.479
But recently. she's
begun sharing about him.

725
00:45:58.583 --> 00:46:03.691
not just his death but
who he was in his life.

726
00:46:03.795 --> 00:46:05.832
It's painful. I know.

727
00:46:05.935 --> 00:46:07.903
Ultimately--
- It helps. Dad.

728
00:46:08.006 --> 00:46:10.008
We're all just pretending
like he never existed.

729
00:46:10.112 --> 00:46:11.838
No. we talk about
him all the time.

730
00:46:11.941 --> 00:46:13.632
It's-- It's costing me
a fortune

731
00:46:13.736 --> 00:46:15.013
to talk about it so much.
- Oh. my God.

732
00:46:15.117 --> 00:46:16.843
That's not the same.

733
00:46:16.946 --> 00:46:20.225
Daisy. why don't you
tell your dad how you feel

734
00:46:20.329 --> 00:46:24.091
using the language
we've been working on?

735
00:46:28.233 --> 00:46:29.787
I just...

736
00:46:31.029 --> 00:46:34.481
I feel like I'm not
allowed to be sad.

737
00:46:35.723 --> 00:46:38.278
And I'm sad all the time.

738
00:46:38.381 --> 00:46:43.835
But if me or mom talk
about him...

739
00:46:44.905 --> 00:46:48.598
...I'm worried you'll
blow up or leave.

740
00:46:52.948 --> 00:46:57.055
I miss him so much.

741
00:46:58.367 --> 00:47:01.059
And I don't know if you
feel guilty or angry.

742
00:47:01.163 --> 00:47:03.096
I-- I don't know how you feel.

743
00:47:03.199 --> 00:47:05.546
All right. all right.
I-I gotta go to work.

744
00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:07.583
I can't just...

745
00:47:07.686 --> 00:47:09.136
Do your job.

746
00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:10.344
Help her.

747
00:47:14.901 --> 00:47:16.834
Fucking knew it.

748
00:47:22.391 --> 00:47:23.910
- Hey.
- What up?

749
00:47:24.013 --> 00:47:25.981
Uh. Patrick needs to see you.

750
00:47:30.192 --> 00:47:33.057
<i>The fuck
outta the road.</i>

751
00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:35.059
- Yeah.
<i>- Stop. stop. stop.</i>

752
00:47:35.162 --> 00:47:36.543
That's you. right?

753
00:47:36.646 --> 00:47:39.132
<i>- Stop.</i>
- Look. Dan.

754
00:47:39.235 --> 00:47:41.030
I know you've been
going through a lot.

755
00:47:41.134 --> 00:47:43.895
- No. There are no excuses.
- But we cannot afford a lawsuit.

756
00:47:43.999 --> 00:47:45.690
Hey. I didn't narc.

757
00:47:45.793 --> 00:47:48.106
Some-- Some teenager posted it
trying to go viral. you know.

758
00:47:48.210 --> 00:47:50.591
This generation. man.
- No. It's my-- It's my fault.

759
00:47:50.695 --> 00:47:52.731
I should have reported
it to you immediately.

760
00:47:52.835 --> 00:47:55.251
It shouldn't have
happened. full stop.

761
00:47:55.355 --> 00:47:57.391
I've also heard. not from Mikey.

762
00:47:57.495 --> 00:48:00.463
that you've been
leaving early some days?

763
00:48:01.533 --> 00:48:04.019
Well. the-- the
deposition's coming up.

764
00:48:04.122 --> 00:48:05.572
What deposition?

765
00:48:06.849 --> 00:48:08.506
It's-- It's for his kid.

766
00:48:08.609 --> 00:48:11.026
They're. uh. suing the-- the
parents and the-- the girl.

767
00:48:13.718 --> 00:48:16.445
- You should take some leave.
- I can't afford it.

768
00:48:16.548 --> 00:48:19.689
We can't afford to have
you. you're a liability.

769
00:48:19.793 --> 00:48:22.520
I-I'm-- I'm fine.

770
00:48:22.623 --> 00:48:25.005
See?

771
00:48:25.109 --> 00:48:28.871
Oh. my love. my wife.

772
00:48:28.975 --> 00:48:31.184
death that had taken the--

773
00:48:31.287 --> 00:48:35.015
death that had taken
thy honey of thy breath

774
00:48:35.119 --> 00:48:38.881
hath had no power
yet upon thy beauty.

775
00:48:38.985 --> 00:48:41.711
Here. here I will remain...

776
00:48:41.815 --> 00:48:43.230
You all right. dear heart?

777
00:48:43.334 --> 00:48:46.302
...with worms that are thy--
Don't tell me.

778
00:48:47.165 --> 00:48:49.961
- Chambermaids.
- Chambermaids.

779
00:48:50.824 --> 00:48:54.310
Eyes. look your last.

780
00:48:54.897 --> 00:48:58.280
Arms. take your last
embrace. and lips.

781
00:48:58.383 --> 00:49:03.733
oh. you the doors of breath.
seal with a righteous kiss.

782
00:49:12.018 --> 00:49:13.640
Here's to my love.

783
00:49:25.169 --> 00:49:28.137
Aah!

784
00:49:28.241 --> 00:49:30.519
Oh. that's-- that's great.
That's good.

785
00:49:30.622 --> 00:49:32.590
Okay.

786
00:49:40.115 --> 00:49:43.049
What's here?

787
00:49:43.601 --> 00:49:46.776
A cup closed in my
true love's hand?

788
00:49:47.363 --> 00:49:51.816
Poison. I see. hath
been his timeless end.

789
00:49:51.919 --> 00:49:54.232
I will kiss thy lips.

790
00:49:54.336 --> 00:49:57.339
Hap'ly some poison
doth hang in them.

791
00:50:00.825 --> 00:50:02.723
Thy lips are warm.

792
00:50:02.827 --> 00:50:06.106
- You're shaking.
- I will be brief.

793
00:50:06.210 --> 00:50:09.627
Oh. happy dagger.
this is thy sheath.

794
00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:14.942
There rust. and let me die.

795
00:50:19.257 --> 00:50:22.157
And they're dead.
thank Christ.

796
00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:25.194
Okay. good job.
everybody. that was great.

797
00:50:25.298 --> 00:50:26.678
Really good.

798
00:50:26.782 --> 00:50:30.199
So. Lucian. Rita. great.
you can take a break.

799
00:50:30.303 --> 00:50:32.891
We're gonna set up for
the parental forgiveness scene.

800
00:50:32.995 --> 00:50:35.722
So. oh. I need my
Capulets. right?

801
00:50:35.825 --> 00:50:39.933
So. Greg. Dan. uh. Lady Monta--
No. wait. you're dead.

802
00:50:40.037 --> 00:50:41.383
- Oh. good.
- Yes.

803
00:50:41.486 --> 00:50:43.178
Uh. but we didn't assign anybody

804
00:50:43.281 --> 00:50:44.765
the first watch line.
- No. no. that was Lucian.

805
00:50:44.869 --> 00:50:46.284
Oh. really? Let's cut it.

806
00:50:46.388 --> 00:50:47.872
Where do you want me?
Am I here? Am I--

807
00:50:47.975 --> 00:50:49.425
Uh. up a little bit.
Up a little bit.

808
00:50:49.529 --> 00:50:51.462
- Can we. uh. wait? Can we--
- Yeah. what is it. Dan?

809
00:50:51.565 --> 00:50:54.568
Uh. we can't end it that way.

810
00:50:54.672 --> 00:50:56.260
Oh. that's not
really the end. though.

811
00:50:56.363 --> 00:50:58.400
because we have the--
- They should wake up.

812
00:51:01.748 --> 00:51:03.784
Yeah.

813
00:51:03.888 --> 00:51:05.027
Oh.

814
00:51:05.131 --> 00:51:08.617
Well. they can't wake up.

815
00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:10.205
Didn't you see me die?

816
00:51:10.308 --> 00:51:12.172
I got poisoned.
She stabbed herself.

817
00:51:12.276 --> 00:51:13.484
Well. it's ridiculous.

818
00:51:13.587 --> 00:51:15.175
They've only known
each other a week.

819
00:51:15.279 --> 00:51:17.212
- That's the story. It's classic.
- It's stupid.

820
00:51:17.315 --> 00:51:18.937
- It's romantic.
- It's tragic.

821
00:51:19.041 --> 00:51:20.353
- But they're young.
- Supposed to be.

822
00:51:20.456 --> 00:51:22.596
- And in love.
- Let's change it. okay?

823
00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:25.151
I mean. we can do that. right.
since it's all made up.

824
00:51:25.254 --> 00:51:27.153
It's make believe.
We can do whatever we want.

825
00:51:27.256 --> 00:51:29.155
We're not changing the ending
to "Romeo and Juliet."

826
00:51:29.258 --> 00:51:30.846
- Why not?
- It's Shakespeare.

827
00:51:30.949 --> 00:51:33.228
Who gives a fuck?!

828
00:51:52.143 --> 00:51:55.629
My... s-son...

829
00:51:58.598 --> 00:52:00.600
...Brian...

830
00:52:06.399 --> 00:52:08.470
died last year.

831
00:52:08.573 --> 00:52:10.334
He was 17.

832
00:52:13.785 --> 00:52:15.787
He did it himself.

833
00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:23.140
I should. uh...

834
00:52:31.182 --> 00:52:32.839
I just...

835
00:52:34.703 --> 00:52:37.706
liked that y'all didn't
look at me weird.

836
00:53:21.646 --> 00:53:22.992
Is that Dad?

837
00:53:55.301 --> 00:53:57.682
- All right. uh--
- Bad news.

838
00:53:57.786 --> 00:53:59.788
Lucian.

839
00:53:59.891 --> 00:54:03.101
And he-- he's making
presence felt in a way.

840
00:54:03.205 --> 00:54:04.517
in a powerful way.

841
00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:08.210
Right. yes. exactly.

842
00:54:08.314 --> 00:54:12.318
- Oh. I can do that.
- Congratulations.

843
00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:14.665
Thank you.

844
00:54:14.768 --> 00:54:16.287
Okay. um.
all right. everybody.

845
00:54:16.391 --> 00:54:18.047
can we. uh. take our seats?

846
00:54:18.151 --> 00:54:19.566
Quick announcement.

847
00:54:21.327 --> 00:54:24.053
So we are making
a casting change.

848
00:54:24.157 --> 00:54:25.538
- Another one?
- Iago.

849
00:54:25.641 --> 00:54:28.334
Lucian has suggested--

850
00:54:28.437 --> 00:54:30.577
The hat thing does not work.

851
00:54:30.681 --> 00:54:32.959
He's going to be
stepping down as Romeo

852
00:54:33.062 --> 00:54:35.651
with Dan stepping in.
- What?

853
00:54:35.755 --> 00:54:36.790
- Yeah.
- Yes.

854
00:54:36.894 --> 00:54:38.102
If we were recasting.

855
00:54:38.205 --> 00:54:39.931
I would like to have
been considered.

856
00:54:40.035 --> 00:54:42.727
- Me. too.
- Lady MacB.

857
00:54:42.831 --> 00:54:44.833
No. I'm
not right for this.

858
00:54:44.936 --> 00:54:46.731
I'm too old.
- So am I.

859
00:54:46.835 --> 00:54:48.733
Oh. I think
you'd be wonderful.

860
00:54:48.837 --> 00:54:51.909
I'm sorry. Dan.
Rita said you wanted this.

861
00:54:52.012 --> 00:54:53.773
Yeah.

862
00:55:15.898 --> 00:55:18.384
There. Now this...

863
00:55:18.487 --> 00:55:21.248
this makes sense.

864
00:55:36.298 --> 00:55:38.196
- See you later.
- Wh-Where are you going?

865
00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:40.785
Uh. I'm meeting
Mikey for a beer.

866
00:55:40.889 --> 00:55:42.269
Again?

867
00:55:42.373 --> 00:55:45.203
Well. uh. he's having
relationship problems.

868
00:55:46.653 --> 00:55:48.448
Can I get a ride?

869
00:55:48.552 --> 00:55:50.554
Wesley Crane said that he
would help me study for trig

870
00:55:50.657 --> 00:55:53.004
if I met him in town.

871
00:55:54.247 --> 00:55:55.800
But you're grounded.

872
00:55:58.596 --> 00:56:01.530
I think if it's for
school. she can go.

873
00:56:15.544 --> 00:56:16.787
Where are you meeting him?

874
00:56:16.890 --> 00:56:19.479
Buzzed. Where are
you meeting Mikey?

875
00:56:19.583 --> 00:56:22.827
Farragut's.
Call me when you're done.

876
00:56:22.931 --> 00:56:24.035
Mm-hmm.

877
00:57:10.288 --> 00:57:11.393
Where is everyone?

878
00:57:17.917 --> 00:57:21.368
Could you. um. both
come have a seat here

879
00:57:21.472 --> 00:57:24.717
on the white blanket. please?

880
00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:27.409
Okay.

881
00:57:27.513 --> 00:57:31.689
Dan. you can sit here.
Rita. over here.

882
00:57:31.793 --> 00:57:34.209
Uh. shoes off. please.

883
00:57:40.353 --> 00:57:44.288
I think that Tyler had a point

884
00:57:44.391 --> 00:57:47.325
about an intimacy coordinator.

885
00:57:47.429 --> 00:57:49.293
Obviously. we can't afford one.

886
00:57:49.396 --> 00:57:51.882
but I have done some research.

887
00:57:53.815 --> 00:57:56.887
I really do want this
to be a safe space.

888
00:57:57.819 --> 00:58:02.202
Okay. um. first step is

889
00:58:02.306 --> 00:58:07.380
to just get comfortable
looking at each other. okay?

890
00:58:07.484 --> 00:58:10.832
So if you could both
sit facing each other.

891
00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:18.633
Okay.

892
00:58:19.875 --> 00:58:23.707
And make eye contact
with each other. please.

893
00:58:26.192 --> 00:58:29.264
And keep-- keep-- keep looking
into each other's eyes.

894
00:58:37.686 --> 00:58:40.275
Okay. that's step one.

895
00:58:48.214 --> 00:58:50.837
Okay. now we're gonna get
comfortable with touch.

896
00:58:50.941 --> 00:58:55.359
So. Rita. you're going
to ask Dan if it's okay

897
00:58:55.462 --> 00:58:57.706
to put your hand
on his shoulder.

898
00:58:59.777 --> 00:59:02.297
Can I put my hand
on your shoulder?

899
00:59:10.547 --> 00:59:12.583
Dan. is that comfortable?

900
00:59:14.896 --> 00:59:17.139
See if you can relax a little.

901
00:59:23.111 --> 00:59:27.149
Okay. now. Dan. you
do the same to Rita.

902
00:59:27.253 --> 00:59:30.290
Mm.

903
00:59:30.394 --> 00:59:32.085
That okay?

904
00:59:41.474 --> 00:59:43.200
That's good. okay. good.

905
00:59:43.303 --> 00:59:47.342
Uh. so now. if you wanna scooch
a little closer to each other

906
00:59:47.445 --> 00:59:50.966
and-- and lean in so just
your foreheads are touching.

907
00:59:53.693 --> 00:59:56.523
Mm. c-can-- can I ask.
what's the point of this?

908
00:59:56.627 --> 00:59:58.836
We're trying to build trust.

909
00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:00.735
little by little. step by step.

910
01:00:00.838 --> 01:00:03.220
the three of us first
and then the two of you

911
01:00:03.323 --> 01:00:06.948
because you're the ones who
are actually gonna be doing it.

912
01:00:07.051 --> 01:00:08.190
Doing what?

913
01:00:08.294 --> 01:00:09.916
- Kissing.
- Falling in love.

914
01:00:11.573 --> 01:00:13.092
I'm married.

915
01:00:13.195 --> 01:00:15.370
Well. good for you.

916
01:00:15.473 --> 01:00:16.958
It's not real.

917
01:00:24.482 --> 01:00:26.139
Okay. lean in.

918
01:00:28.314 --> 01:00:33.215
Okay. and just feel
each other breathing.

919
01:01:07.871 --> 01:01:10.252
Okay. now. Dan. open your eyes.

920
01:01:11.978 --> 01:01:14.153
And you're going to kiss her.

921
01:01:15.706 --> 01:01:18.709
Um. where?

922
01:01:18.813 --> 01:01:20.711
On the lips.

923
01:01:28.926 --> 01:01:31.377
- Hey. asshole!
- Hey. Daisy.

924
01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:32.861
- Yes.
- Say hi to mom. cheater.

925
01:01:32.965 --> 01:01:34.863
- Nothing is happening!
- And who do we have...

926
01:01:34.967 --> 01:01:36.071
- Hey.
- ...here?

927
01:01:36.175 --> 01:01:37.486
- Hey. hey. hey.
- Get ready

928
01:01:37.590 --> 01:01:39.350

- Hey.

929
01:01:39.454 --> 01:01:40.627
Is this your daughter?

930
01:01:40.731 --> 01:01:42.629
She's lovely.

931
01:01:42.733 --> 01:01:45.011
You knew he had kids?

932
01:01:46.599 --> 01:01:48.187
How could you do this?

933
01:01:48.290 --> 01:01:50.327
Excuse me.

934
01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:58.611
Oh. God. is this a threesome?

935
01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:00.509
I-It's fake.

936
01:02:00.613 --> 01:02:02.719
It's for a play.

937
01:02:08.552 --> 01:02:10.105
What play?

938
01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:13.591
- ♪ When the night

live in New York?

944

- ♪ No I won't be afraid
- 16 years.

945
01:02:30.125 --> 01:02:32.783
That's as long as I've
been alive.

946
01:02:32.887 --> 01:02:34.578
I'm gonna move there
when I turn 18.

947
01:02:34.681 --> 01:02:36.545
- Uh. maybe.
- We visited New York

948
01:02:36.649 --> 01:02:39.100
when I was a freshman.
I loved it.

949
01:02:39.203 --> 01:02:41.412
We saw "Phantom of the Opera."

950
01:02:41.516 --> 01:02:43.207
Ticket's cost 180 bucks each.

951
01:02:43.311 --> 01:02:44.933
I had a roommate
who was in "Phantom."

952
01:02:45.037 --> 01:02:46.452
- In the cast?
- Mm-hmm.

953
01:02:46.555 --> 01:02:48.005
How much do you make
on a job like that?

954
01:02:48.109 --> 01:02:49.593
Dad. it's not about the money.

955
01:02:49.696 --> 01:02:50.974
Broadway minimum
is two grand a week.

956
01:02:51.077 --> 01:02:52.769
- Fuck. yeah.
- Hey.

957
01:02:52.872 --> 01:02:54.701
But two grand
is nothing there.

958
01:02:54.805 --> 01:02:57.325
That city just takes and takes

959
01:02:57.428 --> 01:03:00.293
until you're a husk
with 80 grand of debt

960
01:03:00.397 --> 01:03:02.054

Hey. you know what
I like about you?

964
01:03:09.130 --> 01:03:11.339
- What?
- You've got character.

965
01:03:11.442 --> 01:03:12.719
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

966
01:03:12.823 --> 01:03:14.445
And personality.
- Right?

967
01:03:14.549 --> 01:03:16.137
And you know. that's good

968
01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:19.588
because the ingenue phase
lasts about three seconds.

969
01:03:19.692 --> 01:03:21.936
- I love playing the weirdos.
- Yeah.

970
01:03:22.039 --> 01:03:23.938
I auditioned for
"Oklahoma" last year.

971
01:03:24.041 --> 01:03:25.560
And. well. first. I was bummed

972
01:03:25.663 --> 01:03:29.219
because the role of Laurey
went to Chelsea Nussbaum.

973
01:03:29.322 --> 01:03:31.324
She was a senior.

974
01:03:31.428 --> 01:03:32.981
Oh. you have to get
used to the politics.

975
01:03:33.085 --> 01:03:34.396
It's all political.

976
01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:37.089
Yeah. but then I
loved playing Ado Annie.

977
01:03:37.192 --> 01:03:39.436
Because she's the more
interesting character.

978
01:03:39.539 --> 01:03:42.922
- Yeah. she-- she was great.
- He has to say that.

979
01:03:43.026 --> 01:03:44.475

No. watching her on stage
is my favorite thing.

986

Okay. I'm gonna re-up.
um. beers all around?

01:07:00.292 --> 01:07:03.088
- Yeah. right.
- Well. I'm suspended.

1047
01:07:05.331 --> 01:07:09.163
Think about it.
any part you want.

1048
01:07:16.170 --> 01:07:18.137
Your friends are
surprisingly fun.

1049
01:07:18.241 --> 01:07:20.036
Well. they're not
really my friends.

1050
01:07:20.139 --> 01:07:21.796
They're more like coworkers.

1051
01:07:21.899 --> 01:07:24.626
I think you have to be
being paid for it to be a job.

1052
01:07:24.730 --> 01:07:28.699
I can't believe Lanora
wants me to be in the show.

1053
01:07:28.803 --> 01:07:30.667
Well. she needs talent.

1054
01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:33.532
With you. there'd be two
talented people in the cast.

1055
01:07:33.635 --> 01:07:34.740
You and me?

1056
01:07:34.843 --> 01:07:37.087
You and Rita.

1057
01:07:41.436 --> 01:07:43.818
You remember when
I played Rizzo.

1058
01:07:43.921 --> 01:07:45.923
and Marcus Waldrop
played Kenickie.

1059
01:07:46.027 --> 01:07:49.099
and we had to spend that whole
scene making out upstage?

1060
01:07:49.203 --> 01:07:50.687
Yeah. I still don't know
why that was necessary...

1061
01:07:50.790 --> 01:07:52.447
- It was weird because...
- ...for a high school play.

1062
01:07:52.551 --> 01:07:55.416
...I never saw Marcus
like that.

1063
01:07:55.519 --> 01:07:58.384
But then. in the show.
I started liking him.

1064
01:07:58.488 --> 01:08:01.905
and I would get all
cute for rehearsal.

1065
01:08:02.008 --> 01:08:03.700
and my hands would be sweaty.

1066
01:08:03.803 --> 01:08:07.152
And when we kissed. we would
pass candy back and forth.

1067
01:08:08.567 --> 01:08:11.052
We tried to date after closing.

1068
01:08:11.156 --> 01:08:14.055
Didn't work. classic showmance.

1069
01:08:14.159 --> 01:08:17.265
Rizzo loved Kenickie.
but turns out

1070
01:08:17.369 --> 01:08:19.543
Daisy thinks Marcus
is a real tool.

1071
01:08:22.167 --> 01:08:24.686
It's supposed to be fake.

1072
01:08:24.790 --> 01:08:28.690
but the feelings can
feel real sometimes.

1073
01:08:28.794 --> 01:08:30.313
And that's-- that's fine.

1074
01:08:30.416 --> 01:08:32.315
It's even fun sometimes.

1075
01:08:35.145 --> 01:08:37.596
As long as you don't act on it.

1076
01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:51.127
Dad.

1077
01:08:52.473 --> 01:08:54.026
I think it's really great

1078
01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:56.166
that you found
a place where you feel.

1079
01:08:57.685 --> 01:09:00.136
I just don't wanna
screw that up for you.

1080
01:09:05.796 --> 01:09:08.178
Well...

1081
01:09:08.765 --> 01:09:16.669
...let's not tell your mom just
yet about <i>our</i> play.

1082
01:09:19.155 --> 01:09:20.432
I'm gonna be so good.

1083
01:09:20.535 --> 01:09:22.123
It's gonna be legendary.

1084
01:09:22.227 --> 01:09:24.539
I already know what
part I want.

1085
01:09:28.681 --> 01:09:29.786
Uh-oh.

1086
01:09:31.305 --> 01:09:32.927
- Daisy. go to your room.
- What's wrong?

1087
01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:35.343
Go!

1088
01:09:35.447 --> 01:09:37.759
What happened?

1089
01:09:39.934 --> 01:09:41.625
- You motherfucker!
- Hey.

1090
01:09:41.729 --> 01:09:44.076
Do you know who came
to see me tonight?

1091
01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:45.491
Fucking Mikey.

1092
01:09:45.595 --> 01:09:47.252
- Shit.
- I was mortified.

1093
01:09:47.355 --> 01:09:48.736
Let me explain.

1094
01:09:48.839 --> 01:09:51.152
You're on mandatory leave?
Who is she?

1095
01:09:51.256 --> 01:09:52.912
- Who?
- Whoever it is

1096
01:09:53.016 --> 01:09:54.155
you've been sneaking
around with.

1097
01:09:54.259 --> 01:09:55.674
I'm-- There's nobody.

1098
01:09:55.777 --> 01:10:00.782
Oh. my-- Oh. my God.
Daisy and I saw you.

1099
01:10:00.886 --> 01:10:04.890
You know. people told me
that this would happen.

1100
01:10:04.993 --> 01:10:06.650
that-- that couples
who have been through

1101
01:10:06.754 --> 01:10:08.204
what we have...
- Listen. sweetheart.

1102
01:10:08.307 --> 01:10:10.033
...they don't make it.
It's too hard.

1103
01:10:10.136 --> 01:10:11.862
I'm in a play!

1104
01:10:14.624 --> 01:10:16.281
What?

1105
01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:21.527
I'm in a play.

1106
01:10:21.631 --> 01:10:25.566
I've been going to
play practice. uh...

1107
01:10:26.636 --> 01:10:30.191
...for this community
theater production

1108
01:10:30.295 --> 01:10:35.472
of...
"Romeo and Juliet."

1109
01:10:37.923 --> 01:10:40.166
No. ya haven't.

1110
01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:42.099
It's true. Mom.

1111
01:10:42.203 --> 01:10:44.343
I thought he was messing
around on us. too.

1112
01:10:44.447 --> 01:10:47.070
But then I followed him. and...

1113
01:10:47.173 --> 01:10:49.417
he's playing Romeo.

1114
01:10:56.286 --> 01:10:58.012
You're too old.

1115
01:11:02.327 --> 01:11:04.260
Why didn't you tell me?

1116
01:11:05.122 --> 01:11:07.297
'Cause it's embarrassing.

1117
01:11:09.782 --> 01:11:11.991
- You should have told me.
- I know.

1118
01:11:16.410 --> 01:11:18.550
Takes my mind off things.

1119
01:11:25.626 --> 01:11:27.869
Say some of your lines for me.

1120
01:11:27.973 --> 01:11:30.078
- No.
- Come on.

1121
01:11:30.182 --> 01:11:31.701
I won't judge.

1122
01:11:34.013 --> 01:11:36.395
Well. you can't look
at me when I say them.

1123
01:11:36.499 --> 01:11:39.225
I mean it.

1124
01:11:39.329 --> 01:11:41.297
Close your eyes.

1125
01:11:42.436 --> 01:11:43.954
Close them.

1126
01:11:51.134 --> 01:11:55.759
What lady is that

1127
01:11:55.863 --> 01:11:59.660
which doth enrich
the hand of yonder knight?

1128
01:12:00.971 --> 01:12:04.043
Oh. she doth teach
the torches to burn bright.

1129
01:12:05.286 --> 01:12:07.046
Did my heart love till now?

1130
01:12:08.496 --> 01:12:10.049
Forswear it. sight.

1131
01:12:11.844 --> 01:12:15.054
For I never saw true
beauty till this night.

1132
01:12:22.545 --> 01:12:26.134
I'm not gonna say it like that.

1133
01:12:46.672 --> 01:12:48.467
Best agrees with knight.

1134
01:12:48.571 --> 01:12:50.745
Come. civil knight.

1135
01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:54.611
All right. hey.

1139
01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:03.517

Lamb beef. ba-dah-dah.

- Hold it.
- All right. everybody.

1147
01:13:19.671 --> 01:13:21.362
- Who has what ball?
- I don't know what happened

1148
01:13:21.466 --> 01:13:22.812
to mine.
- I don't have a ball.

1149
01:13:22.915 --> 01:13:24.192
I passed it on.
- All right. everybody.

1150
01:13:24.296 --> 01:13:25.539
let's start over.
- Red ball.

1151
01:13:25.642 --> 01:13:26.850
Red ball. thank you.
Red ball.

1152
01:13:26.954 --> 01:13:29.025

1153
01:13:29.128 --> 01:13:30.923
School house. ba-dah-dah.

Let's stay in it.
Let's stay in it.

1156
01:13:37.378 --> 01:13:38.655
Rita.
- Crap.

1157
01:13:38.759 --> 01:13:41.486
- Cow.
- Cow crap. ba-dah-dah.

1158
01:13:46.939 --> 01:13:48.078
Hello.

1159
01:13:49.942 --> 01:13:51.634
- They're so old.
- Look at these losers. yo.

1160
01:13:51.737 --> 01:13:53.601
- Excuse me.
- They're so old.

1161
01:13:55.569 --> 01:13:58.364
One more.
Aah! There.

1162
01:14:03.231 --> 01:14:05.371
Aah!

1163
01:14:05.475 --> 01:14:08.305
There you go. That was good.

1164
01:14:08.409 --> 01:14:10.929
Okay. everybody. that's time.

1165
01:14:11.032 --> 01:14:12.102
That's time.

1166
01:14:12.206 --> 01:14:15.865
Be off book tomorrow for real.

1167
01:14:15.968 --> 01:14:18.315
And if you forget
your line. improvise.

1168
01:14:18.419 --> 01:14:21.077
- In iambic pentameter.
- Ah.

1169
01:14:21.871 --> 01:14:23.286
Hey. hun.

1170
01:14:23.389 --> 01:14:24.632
I wasn't sure
if I should come in.

1171
01:14:24.736 --> 01:14:26.427
No. come on in
and meet the team.

1172
01:14:26.531 --> 01:14:28.671
- Hi.
- This is Jonah and Greg.

1173
01:14:28.774 --> 01:14:31.018
Lucian. and-- and that's Moira.

1174
01:14:31.121 --> 01:14:32.916
- I'm Sharon.
- My mom.

1175
01:14:33.779 --> 01:14:35.125
And that's Lanora. our director.

1176
01:14:35.229 --> 01:14:36.575
- Hello.
- And Rita.

1177
01:14:36.679 --> 01:14:39.095
she plays Juliet.
- Hi.

1178
01:14:40.752 --> 01:14:45.204
- It's so nice to meet you.
- Oh. you. too.

1179
01:14:45.308 --> 01:14:47.137
I can't wait to see the show.

1180
01:14:47.241 --> 01:14:48.863
It will be happening.

1181
01:14:48.967 --> 01:14:50.693
Uh. where's
the performance gonna be?

1182
01:14:50.796 --> 01:14:53.350
- Here.
- No. really?

1183
01:14:53.454 --> 01:14:55.283
- It's intimate.
- That blows.

1184
01:14:55.387 --> 01:14:56.595
- Hey.
- Hey.

1185
01:14:56.699 --> 01:14:58.045
- I mean. it's so small.
- Mm-hmm.

1186
01:14:58.148 --> 01:15:00.496
It's mad hot.
and the bathrooms suck.

1187
01:15:00.599 --> 01:15:02.290
- Oh. it's not that bad.
- Stop. stop. stop.

1188
01:15:02.394 --> 01:15:05.017
All right. all right.

1189
01:15:05.121 --> 01:15:06.743
We deserve a stage.

1190
01:15:06.847 --> 01:15:08.676
Well. we tried many
different spaces.

1191
01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:10.851
We tried the park.
- There was a tornado.

1192
01:15:10.954 --> 01:15:12.577
- Mm-hmm.
- We tried a church.

1193
01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:14.440
She got in
a fight with a priest.

1194
01:15:14.544 --> 01:15:16.304
- Ah.
- That's right.

1195
01:15:16.408 --> 01:15:17.582
I may know of a place.

1196
01:15:34.391 --> 01:15:36.048
This would
be perfect. wouldn't it?

1197
01:15:36.152 --> 01:15:37.498
Whoo.

1198
01:15:37.602 --> 01:15:40.570
No pressure to use
it. it's nothing fancy.

1199
01:15:40.674 --> 01:15:44.022
Oh. it's gorgeous.
This is just gorgeous.

1200
01:15:44.125 --> 01:15:46.438
How much?

1201
01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:48.129
- Free.
- Whoo.

1202
01:15:48.233 --> 01:15:50.338
- She said it's free.
- When will you need it?

1203
01:15:50.442 --> 01:15:54.377
Uh. um. dress rehearsal's
Thursday. curtain up Friday.

1204
01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:57.691
- Next Friday?
- One night only.

1205
01:15:57.794 --> 01:16:00.556
- Big day.
- This is unbelievable.

1206
01:16:00.659 --> 01:16:02.212
This'll work.

1207
01:16:11.705 --> 01:16:13.016
No. don't bite him.

1208
01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:14.570
I didn't bite him.
I was kissing him.

1209
01:16:14.673 --> 01:16:16.192
You get a prize.
What do you want?

1210
01:16:16.295 --> 01:16:17.883
Oh. oh. I want the panda.
How many for the panda?

1211
01:16:17.987 --> 01:16:19.402
- You need 20.
- You sure? Check your pockets.

1212
01:16:19.505 --> 01:16:20.886
- Yeah. I'm sure.
- Here you go.

1213
01:16:20.990 --> 01:16:22.578
I checked my pockets
like three times.

1214
01:16:22.681 --> 01:16:23.855
- Uh. there we go.
- Right there.

1215
01:16:23.958 --> 01:16:26.927
- Panda. please.
- Panda. please.

1216
01:16:28.618 --> 01:16:30.102
- Here we go.
- Yay.

1217
01:16:30.206 --> 01:16:32.518
- For my lady.
- Aw.

1218
01:16:35.004 --> 01:16:36.799
Mm.

1219
01:16:36.902 --> 01:16:38.973
Oh.

1220
01:16:47.292 --> 01:16:49.881
- Hun. what's wrong?
- What's the matter?

1221
01:16:52.228 --> 01:16:53.678
Daisy. wait.

1222
01:16:55.956 --> 01:17:00.167
Daisy. honey. honey.

1223
01:17:03.066 --> 01:17:06.069
Sweetheart.
- Where are my keys?

1224
01:17:06.173 --> 01:17:09.348
I-- I-I'll be right there.
I'm coming.

1225
01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:17.978
Mr. Mueller.

1226
01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:21.913
Sorry. the guy back there
was looking for you.

1227
01:17:26.572 --> 01:17:29.437
How are you? How's Daisy?

1228
01:17:31.129 --> 01:17:33.994
You know. not good.

1229
01:17:34.857 --> 01:17:37.066
Where are your parents?

1230
01:17:37.169 --> 01:17:39.620
I told them
I had to use the bathroom.

1231
01:17:39.724 --> 01:17:41.104
- I gotta go.
- Can I--

1232
01:17:42.416 --> 01:17:44.729
Um...

1233
01:17:44.832 --> 01:17:47.697
I don't
really know what to say.

1234
01:17:49.319 --> 01:17:51.218
We're not supposed
to be talking at all.

1235
01:17:51.321 --> 01:17:53.151
I know.

1236
01:17:56.154 --> 01:17:58.121
I'm so sorry.

1237
01:18:00.710 --> 01:18:02.056
And I know that's. like.

1238
01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:04.403
the stupidest
possible thing to say.

1239
01:18:06.336 --> 01:18:09.201
Uh. did you. uh. did
you all get my letters?

1240
01:18:10.444 --> 01:18:12.239
You can't contact us.

1241
01:18:14.448 --> 01:18:16.174
I know you hate me.

1242
01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:20.143
I hate me. too.

1243
01:18:20.247 --> 01:18:22.283
I'm gonna hate myself
for the rest of my life.

1244
01:18:22.387 --> 01:18:25.252
- Christine.
- I-I didn't mean to wake up.

1245
01:18:31.568 --> 01:18:36.194
Um. do you think-- Could I
apologize to Mrs. Mueller?

1246
01:18:37.643 --> 01:18:40.163
No. that
wouldn't be a good idea.

1247
01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:44.996
Um. uh. could you maybe just
give this to Daisy from me?

1248
01:18:52.210 --> 01:18:53.487
Thanks.

1249
01:19:21.653 --> 01:19:23.793
Okay.

1250
01:19:27.141 --> 01:19:28.936
- You got it?
- Yeah. I got it.

1251
01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:30.731
- Beauty.
- I got it.

1252
01:19:30.835 --> 01:19:33.423
- You gotta go all the way down.
- All the way down? All right.

1253
01:19:36.116 --> 01:19:38.704
Yeah. that's-- that moves
a little quicker from there.

1254
01:19:38.808 --> 01:19:40.603
Mm. maybe like that.

1255
01:19:40.706 --> 01:19:42.639
There's a section.

1256
01:19:46.126 --> 01:19:49.819
One. two. three.

1257
01:19:49.923 --> 01:19:53.512
- Ah.
- Flapping our arms.

1258
01:19:53.616 --> 01:19:56.308
When we flap our arms. we're
opening up our up lungs.

1259
01:19:56.412 --> 01:19:57.585
Gonna open up our lungs.

1260
01:19:57.689 --> 01:20:00.588
- One. two.
- Uh. red ball.

1261
01:20:00.692 --> 01:20:02.901
Red ball to you.

1262
01:20:03.005 --> 01:20:04.972
- Cool. yeah.
- Red ball.

1263
01:20:05.076 --> 01:20:06.732
- Oh.
- Thank you.

1264
01:20:08.665 --> 01:20:11.565
Red ball.

1265
01:20:11.668 --> 01:20:13.015
- Yeah.
- Oh. yeah.

1266
01:20:13.118 --> 01:20:15.327
- That's good.
- Oh. yeah.

1267
01:20:15.431 --> 01:20:17.019
Yeah. better.

1268
01:20:20.919 --> 01:20:25.406
Oh. she's cold.

1269
01:20:27.029 --> 01:20:29.065
Her-- Her blood is settled.

1270
01:20:29.169 --> 01:20:33.967
and her joints are stiff.

1271
01:20:36.383 --> 01:20:40.214
Life and these lips have
long been separated.

1272
01:20:43.079 --> 01:20:47.739
Death has lain upon her
like an untimely frost

1273
01:20:47.843 --> 01:20:53.503
upon the sweetest
flower of the field.

1274
01:20:53.607 --> 01:20:57.404
O. child. O. child.

1275
01:20:58.784 --> 01:21:01.477
My soul and not my child.

1276
01:21:02.996 --> 01:21:05.653
Dead thou art. alack.

1277
01:21:05.757 --> 01:21:08.104
My child is dead.

1278
01:21:12.937 --> 01:21:14.455
- You got this?
- Yeah.

1279
01:21:14.559 --> 01:21:18.874
And with my child.
my joys are buried.

1280
01:21:42.276 --> 01:21:47.454
Uh. oh. my-- my love. my wife.

1281
01:21:47.557 --> 01:21:49.076
Louder.

1282
01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:51.492
Uh. sorry. sorry.

1283
01:21:51.596 --> 01:21:54.599
There's no calling for lines.
Just make something up.

1284
01:21:56.566 --> 01:21:58.396
- Uh...
- Are you okay?

1285
01:21:58.499 --> 01:22:00.743
Sorry. sorry.

1286
01:22:00.846 --> 01:22:02.296
Are you
having a panic attack?

1287
01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:03.988
Someone get him
some ice to hold.

1288
01:22:04.091 --> 01:22:07.715
Uh. I. uh. I don't--
I don't understand.

1289
01:22:07.819 --> 01:22:11.512
- What the-- the language or--
- Remember your folio clues.

1290
01:22:11.616 --> 01:22:14.136
- Locking up.
- Just five minutes. please.

1291
01:22:14.239 --> 01:22:15.792
You gonna pay for it?

1292
01:22:15.896 --> 01:22:18.036
We'll talk about it after
the run. Finish the scene.

1293
01:22:18.140 --> 01:22:20.418
You're almost dead.
You are so close.

1294
01:22:21.591 --> 01:22:23.179
Lanora. we need to hold.

1295
01:22:23.283 --> 01:22:25.630
Look. I'm not kidding ya.
I'll lock you all in here.

1296
01:22:25.733 --> 01:22:27.597
- What the hell?
- Okay. okay.

1297
01:22:36.779 --> 01:22:40.403
We have five minutes.
I gave him $10. so. Dad--

1298
01:22:40.507 --> 01:22:42.405
Hey. look. Daisy. this
doesn't concern you.

1299
01:22:42.509 --> 01:22:45.167
- Fuck it doesn't.
- Hey. I don't wanna talk.

1300
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:48.584
No shit. When things get hard.
you either blow up or bail.

1301
01:22:48.687 --> 01:22:50.275
It's a bad habit.

1302
01:22:50.379 --> 01:22:52.105
Daisy.

1303
01:23:00.113 --> 01:23:02.494
It makes sense how painful
this is for you. Dan.

1304
01:23:02.598 --> 01:23:06.291
and. Daisy. I'm guessing it's
not easy for you either.

1305
01:23:08.949 --> 01:23:11.952
You told them?

1306
01:23:12.056 --> 01:23:14.196
I would never do
something like this.

1307
01:23:14.299 --> 01:23:16.853
That's the problem-- you're
still thinking as yourself.

1308
01:23:16.957 --> 01:23:18.200
Well. who am I
supposed to think as?

1309
01:23:18.303 --> 01:23:20.064
Him.

1310
01:23:21.927 --> 01:23:25.310
I-It won't work
if you're judging him.

1311
01:23:25.414 --> 01:23:28.417
You can't worry
about the ending yet.

1312
01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:31.144
Don't anticipate.
Just focus on the love.

1313
01:23:33.629 --> 01:23:35.631
It's dangerous
to romanticize--

1314
01:23:35.734 --> 01:23:37.840
I'm not.

1315
01:23:37.943 --> 01:23:39.497
I can't condone what they did.

1316
01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:41.499
You're not saying that
what they're doing is right.

1317
01:23:41.602 --> 01:23:45.503
Can't you just think about
how he felt for five minutes?

1318
01:23:45.606 --> 01:23:49.093
He-- He felt trapped
a-and alone.

1319
01:23:49.196 --> 01:23:50.887
How do you know that?

1320
01:23:50.991 --> 01:23:53.649
I think about
him all the time.

1321
01:23:57.756 --> 01:24:03.210
Dad. you get to be him
for a couple of hours.

1322
01:24:06.006 --> 01:24:10.114
Okay. start by thinking...

1323
01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:15.567
"I would never kill
myself unless"...

1324
01:24:17.638 --> 01:24:19.468
And then you imagine.

1325
01:24:20.814 --> 01:24:24.680
But by doing this.
he doesn't get her back.

1326
01:24:24.783 --> 01:24:26.716
I.

1327
01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:33.551
I don't get her back.

1328
01:24:38.073 --> 01:24:40.385
Time's up.

1329
01:24:42.146 --> 01:24:44.251
- Come on. let's go.
- Okay. okay.

1330
01:24:44.355 --> 01:24:45.977
We're gonna be late.
We're always late.

1331
01:24:46.081 --> 01:24:48.807
We're always late.
- Okay.

1332
01:24:48.911 --> 01:24:51.362
- Come on. guys.
- Okay. okay.

1333
01:24:51.465 --> 01:24:54.019
Are you gonna shave?
- Shit. all right.

1334
01:24:54.123 --> 01:24:55.366
Might as well shave now.

1335
01:24:55.469 --> 01:24:57.126
No. we-- Look. we
don't have time.

1336
01:24:57.230 --> 01:24:59.887
We just don't have time.
- What'd you bring it up for?

1337
01:25:05.962 --> 01:25:07.999
What?

1338
01:25:08.103 --> 01:25:10.346
You got something
on your face.

1339
01:25:21.978 --> 01:25:23.704
Showtime.

1340
01:25:39.927 --> 01:25:42.171
Wait. oh. here they are.

1341
01:26:07.196 --> 01:26:09.578
Uh. Mr. Mueller. um. my
name is Joan Spencer.

1342
01:26:09.681 --> 01:26:11.442
and I'm representing
the Hawthornes

1343
01:26:11.545 --> 01:26:13.616
in the wrongful
death suit that you

1344
01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:16.792
and Mrs. Mueller have
filed against them.

1345
01:26:16.895 --> 01:26:20.140
I'm just gonna ask you
a series of questions today

1346
01:26:20.244 --> 01:26:22.315
regarding your son.
Brian Mueller.

1347
01:26:22.418 --> 01:26:26.526
and his death on May
25th of last year.

1348
01:26:27.699 --> 01:26:31.186
So could you start
by describing Brian

1349
01:26:31.289 --> 01:26:33.947
to us before he
met Miss Hawthorne?

1350
01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:36.501
What-- Wh-What do you mean?

1351
01:26:36.605 --> 01:26:38.227
You know.
like. what was he like?

1352
01:26:38.331 --> 01:26:39.987
Was he. uh. outgoing. introverted.

1353
01:26:40.091 --> 01:26:42.197
um. popular. cerebral?

1354
01:26:43.405 --> 01:26:46.994
He was smart. shy.

1355
01:26:47.098 --> 01:26:50.550
sweet.

1356
01:26:50.653 --> 01:26:53.518
Could he have been
described as sensitive?

1357
01:26:54.933 --> 01:26:56.383
Sensitive like?

1358
01:26:56.487 --> 01:26:59.662
Like. would things
get to him easily?

1359
01:26:59.766 --> 01:27:03.252
- Well. he had big feelings.
- How so?

1360
01:27:05.392 --> 01:27:10.604
Uh. I'm-- I-I-I'm old school.

1361
01:27:10.708 --> 01:27:14.125
I-- I'm-- I'm not--
I don't get the therapy.

1362
01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:17.059
and the-- the talking
and the...

1363
01:27:17.162 --> 01:27:18.992
Oh. uh.
verbally please.

1364
01:27:20.511 --> 01:27:21.995
I don't-- I don't
know what normal is.

1365
01:27:22.098 --> 01:27:26.413
I. uh-- You know. both
my kids are dramatic.

1366
01:27:26.517 --> 01:27:29.347
They don't get it from me.

1367
01:27:29.451 --> 01:27:31.487
Would you
say he was depressed?

1368
01:27:32.971 --> 01:27:34.801
Not as--

1369
01:27:34.904 --> 01:27:39.254
Not always.
- Oh. not that you noticed?

1370
01:27:39.357 --> 01:27:41.428
Only at the end of his life.

1371
01:27:43.396 --> 01:27:46.847
Um. could you
tell us about Brian

1372
01:27:46.951 --> 01:27:49.505
once he met Miss Hawthorne?

1373
01:27:53.854 --> 01:27:58.376
- He was pretty obsessed.
- Like. in an unhealthy way?

1374
01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:01.448
Again. I-- I don't know what...

1375
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.382
I proposed to Sharon
after our first date.

1376
01:28:04.486 --> 01:28:07.420
and. uh. that's crazy to me now.

1377
01:28:08.904 --> 01:28:10.423
He seemed happy.

1378
01:28:10.526 --> 01:28:13.357
Okay. and when
did that change?

1379
01:28:16.808 --> 01:28:20.502
Uh. Christine's family
was moving to Arizona.

1380
01:28:20.605 --> 01:28:24.989
and. uh. Christine didn't
wanna go because of Brian.

1381
01:28:25.092 --> 01:28:27.681
but she didn't have a choice.

1382
01:28:27.785 --> 01:28:30.305
Brian told us he
wanted to go with her

1383
01:28:30.408 --> 01:28:33.342
and. uh. finish high
school out there with her.

1384
01:28:34.412 --> 01:28:37.760
We wouldn't--
I-I wouldn't allow it.

1385
01:28:37.864 --> 01:28:40.418
He-- He wasn't 18.
He was still a kid.

1386
01:28:42.972 --> 01:28:47.218
And there were blowups.
got pretty bad.

1387
01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:50.117
We told him he couldn't
see her anymore.

1388
01:28:53.086 --> 01:28:55.019
He tried to run away.

1389
01:28:55.122 --> 01:28:58.885
and we took away his phone.

1390
01:28:58.988 --> 01:29:01.543
Uh. we hid the car
keys. credit cards.

1391
01:29:03.683 --> 01:29:05.650
Did he ever get violent?

1392
01:29:08.826 --> 01:29:10.586
He-- He shoved me once
trying to get out the door.

1393
01:29:10.690 --> 01:29:12.381
but he-- he's skinny.

1394
01:29:12.485 --> 01:29:15.764
It wasn't-- wasn't real.

1395
01:29:18.422 --> 01:29:21.183
Mr. Mueller.
can you take us

1396
01:29:21.286 --> 01:29:23.358
through the night of May 25th?

1397
01:29:24.497 --> 01:29:27.258
Uh...

1398
01:29:27.362 --> 01:29:29.087
Uh...

1399
01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:36.198
It was Daisy's opening
night of "Oklahoma."

1400
01:29:36.301 --> 01:29:40.444
Uh. she was so good in it.

1401
01:29:42.031 --> 01:29:45.069
And Brian played oboe
in the orchestra.

1402
01:29:46.035 --> 01:29:48.521
And we all went
to Friday's after.

1403
01:29:50.005 --> 01:29:52.904
Uh. Brian was quiet.

1404
01:29:55.010 --> 01:29:56.667
We came home.

1405
01:29:56.770 --> 01:29:58.393
Sharon and Daisy went to bed.

1406
01:29:58.496 --> 01:30:01.603
I went to turn out
the back porch light.

1407
01:30:02.983 --> 01:30:07.229
I saw Brian sitting in
the backyard on the trampoline.

1408
01:30:07.332 --> 01:30:09.680
like how we would do when he...

1409
01:30:16.065 --> 01:30:18.654
...when he was a kid.

1410
01:30:18.758 --> 01:30:20.863
Um...

1411
01:30:20.967 --> 01:30:25.661
When I asked if
he was coming in.

1412
01:30:25.765 --> 01:30:27.629
he said. "In a minute."

1413
01:30:29.562 --> 01:30:33.497
Next morning. I-I-I
was up early for work.

1414
01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:36.189
and I saw two...

1415
01:30:36.292 --> 01:30:42.229
I-I-I-I thought there
were animals maybe sleeping.

1416
01:30:42.333 --> 01:30:44.784
lying on the trampoline.

1417
01:30:46.337 --> 01:30:48.926
It-- It was Brian and. uh...

1418
01:30:50.272 --> 01:30:53.102
- Verbally. please.
- Christine.

1419
01:31:03.112 --> 01:31:04.666
They had empty...

1420
01:31:08.393 --> 01:31:11.155
...prescription
bottles around them.

1421
01:31:11.258 --> 01:31:15.780
uh. Klonopin. Xanax.

1422
01:31:15.884 --> 01:31:19.612
Uh. they were her mother's.
I guess. uh. Mrs. Hawthorne.

1423
01:31:21.510 --> 01:31:24.064
I called an ambulance.

1424
01:31:24.168 --> 01:31:27.551
I performed CPR
until they got there.

1425
01:31:30.657 --> 01:31:32.245
Christine woke up.

1426
01:31:37.181 --> 01:31:41.047
I'm very sorry for your loss.

1427
01:31:43.463 --> 01:31:47.294
And you blame Miss Hawthorne
for providing the drugs

1428
01:31:47.398 --> 01:31:51.678
and Mr. and Mrs. Hawthorne for
not keeping them more secure?

1429
01:31:57.581 --> 01:31:59.479
I think Christine
having access

1430
01:31:59.583 --> 01:32:01.861
to those substances
made it easier.

1431
01:32:01.964 --> 01:32:05.140
I'm not sure they woulda gone
through with it otherwise.

1432
01:32:05.243 --> 01:32:07.798
But they may have.
I mean. you can't be sure.

1433
01:32:07.901 --> 01:32:10.939
I-I find it difficult to
understand any of what they did.

1434
01:32:17.635 --> 01:32:20.120
I'm trying to understand...

1435
01:32:24.953 --> 01:32:27.645
...how bad you two
must have felt...

1436
01:32:29.647 --> 01:32:32.650
...t-to do-- to do something
like that.

1437
01:32:39.139 --> 01:32:42.971
I know it isn't easy.
and if it had gone differently.

1438
01:32:43.074 --> 01:32:45.801
we could be sitting on
that side of the table.

1439
01:32:52.912 --> 01:32:56.778
I'm angry with you.
and you. and him.

1440
01:32:56.881 --> 01:33:00.264
and myself!

1441
01:33:06.615 --> 01:33:08.824
I'm heartbroken.

1442
01:33:14.381 --> 01:33:16.625
I'm not sorry you woke up.

1443
01:33:20.215 --> 01:33:22.044
I just wish he had. too.

1444
01:33:30.605 --> 01:33:32.641
It's not your fault.

1445
01:33:50.486 --> 01:33:52.005
Sharon. wait.

1446
01:33:52.109 --> 01:33:56.389
Why did you make us
do this. all this time.

1447
01:33:56.492 --> 01:34:00.635
this emotional-- so much
money that we don't have?

1448
01:34:00.738 --> 01:34:04.017
No! You don't think that
I wanna disappear

1449
01:34:04.121 --> 01:34:08.090
every time shit gets
hard. to scream?

1450
01:34:09.505 --> 01:34:11.128
I am exhausted.

1451
01:34:11.231 --> 01:34:14.131
I've been holding this
family together by a thread.

1452
01:34:16.305 --> 01:34:20.206
I want to mourn him.

1453
01:34:21.621 --> 01:34:24.037
I haven't gotten to start.

1454
01:34:34.082 --> 01:34:36.084
It's not fair that
you get to be the hero

1455
01:34:36.187 --> 01:34:38.327
when you haven't
done any of the work.

1456
01:34:43.091 --> 01:34:44.609

Don't fuck up.

1482
01:36:45.351 --> 01:36:47.491
- Don't fuck up!
- Don't fuck up!

1483
01:36:54.912 --> 01:36:57.950
- Good luck. honey.
- You don't say "good luck."

1484
01:37:03.058 --> 01:37:05.164
It's break a leg.

1485
01:37:07.580 --> 01:37:09.409
Break a leg.

1486
01:37:24.183 --> 01:37:26.806
Shh. shh. shh. shh. shh.

1487
01:37:40.199 --> 01:37:44.444
Two households.
both alike in dignity

1488
01:37:44.548 --> 01:37:47.620
in fair Verona where
we lay our scene.

1489
01:37:47.723 --> 01:37:50.105
From ancient grudge
break new mutiny

1490
01:37:50.209 --> 01:37:53.971
where civil blood makes
civil hands unclean.

1491
01:37:54.075 --> 01:37:57.009
From forth the fatal
loins of these two foes.

1492
01:37:57.112 --> 01:38:01.496
a pair of star-crossed
lovers take their life

1493
01:38:01.599 --> 01:38:04.982
whose misadventured
piteous overthrows doth.

1494
01:38:05.086 --> 01:38:08.399
with their death. bury
their parents' strife.

1495
01:38:10.056 --> 01:38:12.817
You bite your
thumb at us. sir?

1496
01:38:12.921 --> 01:38:14.750
I do bite my thumb. sir.

1497
01:38:14.854 --> 01:38:16.960
You bite
your thumb at us. sir?

1498
01:38:17.063 --> 01:38:18.547
Do you quarrel. sir?

1499
01:38:18.651 --> 01:38:20.584
Draw if you be men.

1500
01:38:20.687 --> 01:38:22.137
Back up. Daisy.

1501
01:38:27.418 --> 01:38:29.973
Halt. fools.
Put up your swords.

1502
01:38:30.076 --> 01:38:32.527
You know not what you do.

1503
01:38:32.630 --> 01:38:34.632
Oh. where is Romeo?

1504
01:38:34.736 --> 01:38:36.462
Saw you him today?

1505
01:38:37.428 --> 01:38:40.017
Hardest part is
the first line. right?

1506
01:38:40.121 --> 01:38:41.743
All downhill from there.

1507
01:38:46.265 --> 01:38:49.924
- Good morrow. cousin.
- Is the day so young?

1508
01:38:50.027 --> 01:38:53.168
- But new struck nine.
- Aye. me.

1509
01:38:53.272 --> 01:38:54.963
sad hours seem long.

1510
01:38:55.067 --> 01:38:57.690
Whoo. Danny!

1511
01:39:27.202 --> 01:39:29.860
If I profane with
my unworthiest hand

1512
01:39:29.964 --> 01:39:33.105
this holy shrine.
the gentle sin is this.

1513
01:39:33.208 --> 01:39:34.865
my lips two blushing pilgrims.

1514
01:39:34.969 --> 01:39:39.214
ready stand to smooth that
rough touch with a gentle kiss.

1515
01:40:03.411 --> 01:40:05.447
Romeo.

1516
01:40:05.551 --> 01:40:09.727
O. Romeo.

1517
01:40:09.831 --> 01:40:12.109
wherefore art thou. Romeo?

1518
01:40:13.248 --> 01:40:16.803
Soft. what light through
yonder window breaks?

1519
01:40:18.115 --> 01:40:21.739
It is the east.
and Juliet is the sun.

1520
01:40:31.887 --> 01:40:33.268
I am too bold.

1521
01:40:35.063 --> 01:40:36.823
Dan. uh. you okay. bro?

1522
01:40:38.584 --> 01:40:40.241
I'm good.

1523
01:40:43.347 --> 01:40:46.316
Did you hear that applause?
I love that sound.

1524
01:40:46.419 --> 01:40:48.145
Oh. Dan. you were on fire.

1525
01:40:48.249 --> 01:40:50.182
Oh. so were you
with that sword fight.

1526
01:40:51.735 --> 01:40:53.633
- All right. just don't breathe.
- I'm not.

1527
01:40:53.737 --> 01:40:55.325
I'm gonna be late
for my entrance. Come on.

1528
01:40:55.428 --> 01:40:57.051
I know. I know. I know.
It's almost good.

1529
01:40:57.154 --> 01:40:58.362
And. Jonah. your Capulet.

1530
01:40:58.466 --> 01:40:59.846
I ad-libbed a little.
Could you tell?

1531
01:40:59.950 --> 01:41:01.365
- Yes.
- Okay. that's good.

1532
01:41:01.469 --> 01:41:02.884
That's good. Let's go. let's go.
- Okay. go. go. go.

01:42:39.291 --> 01:42:41.465
Courage. man.

1556
01:42:41.569 --> 01:42:43.916
The hurt can't be much.

1557
01:42:47.609 --> 01:42:52.545
A plague on both your houses.

1558
01:43:13.773 --> 01:43:17.708
I am fortune's fool.

1559
01:43:25.026 --> 01:43:26.786
Are you okay?
- Yeah. are you?

1560
01:43:26.890 --> 01:43:29.479
Let's bring this baby home.

1561
01:43:34.932 --> 01:43:39.420
Hold. daughter. I do
spy a kind of hope.

1562
01:43:52.156 --> 01:43:54.573
Come on. Dan.

1563
01:44:11.728 --> 01:44:13.454
Oh. my love.

1564
01:44:36.304 --> 01:44:40.032
Death that hath sucked

1565
01:44:40.135 --> 01:44:43.587
the honey of thy breath...

1566
01:44:45.555 --> 01:44:48.558
...hath had no power
yet upon thy beauty.

1567
01:44:52.941 --> 01:44:55.703
Why art thou yet so fair?

1568
01:45:11.235 --> 01:45:16.620
Here. here will I remain.

1569
01:45:16.724 --> 01:45:21.522
here I will set up
my everlasting rest.

1570
01:45:27.493 --> 01:45:31.048
Eyes. look your last.

1571
01:45:35.087 --> 01:45:37.745
Arms. take your last embrace.

1572
01:45:46.581 --> 01:45:50.758
And lips. oh. you
the doors of breath...

1573
01:45:52.380 --> 01:45:54.520
...seal with a righteous kiss.

1574
01:46:27.242 --> 01:46:29.175
Here's to my love.

1575
01:46:57.169 --> 01:46:58.550
Romeo.

1576
01:47:02.001 --> 01:47:03.417
What's here?

1577
01:47:06.074 --> 01:47:09.975
Poison I see hath
been his timeless end.

1578
01:47:10.078 --> 01:47:14.013
drunk all and left no friendly
drop to help me after.

1579
01:47:19.363 --> 01:47:23.195
Oh. happy dagger.

1580
01:47:23.298 --> 01:47:26.440
this is thy sheath.

1581
01:47:26.543 --> 01:47:29.753
There rust. and let me die.

1582
01:47:52.776 --> 01:47:56.642
A glooming peace this
morning with it brings.

1583
01:47:56.746 --> 01:48:00.543
The sun for sorrow
shall not show its head.

1584
01:48:02.579 --> 01:48:05.996
Some will be pardoned
and some punished.

1585
01:48:08.482 --> 01:48:11.277
For never was there
a story of more woe...

1586
01:48:13.107 --> 01:48:16.110
...than this of Juliet

1587
01:48:16.213 --> 01:48:17.870
and her Romeo.

1588
01:49:07.644 --> 01:49:09.301
- Hi.
- That was really. really great.

1589
01:49:09.404 --> 01:49:12.200
Thanks.

1590
01:49:12.304 --> 01:49:14.617
Dan. that was amazing.

1591
01:49:15.618 --> 01:49:18.828
Holy cow. dude.

1592
01:49:22.970 --> 01:49:24.765
Congrats.

1593
01:49:37.191 --> 01:49:39.573
Mom.

1594
01:49:39.676 --> 01:49:42.472
- You were fantastic.
- Yeah?

1595
01:49:45.371 --> 01:49:47.235
No more plays where you die.

1596
01:50:17.611 --> 01:50:19.682
I'm not even tired.

1597
01:50:19.785 --> 01:50:21.994
Bye. guys. bye.

1598
01:50:28.345 --> 01:50:29.657

1599
