3
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.833
You recording? ERIC: Yep.

4
00:00:24.834 --> 00:00:27.420
Okay. so basically we're
out in Itaewon right now.

5
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.297
This is where the
Colosseum takes place.

6
00:00:29.297 --> 00:00:31.424
The underground fight
club we've been looking for.

7
00:00:31.716 --> 00:00:34.844
We're going to be walking
around Itaewon and see if there is

8
00:00:34.844 --> 00:00:37.013
anybody who can lead
us in the right direction.

9
00:00:37.138 --> 00:00:38.640
So let's head out.

10
00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:42.626
Yea I just followed my
friend but it was too brutal.

11
00:00:42.644 --> 00:00:44.229
So. I don't want
to go there again.

12
00:00:44.646 --> 00:00:47.399
Look for the guys'
that. you know.

13
00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.945
Around asking so many people about this.
Especially like. oh who told you by the way

14
00:01:01.121 --> 00:01:03.498
You have to have friends
to get into the dark web

15
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.127
You have to already know the IP
addresses to get into the dark web.

16
00:01:07.127 --> 00:01:08.128
Then

17
00:01:10.213 --> 00:01:13.049
Yeah. there's all these
secret clubs societies.

18
00:01:20.223 --> 00:01:22.517
I'm just saying like when you
go out and ask people about

19
00:01:22.517 --> 00:01:23.968
a fight club you
gotta be careful.

20
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.638
You're not sure what you
might get yourself into.

21
00:01:29.024 --> 00:01:30.041
What's the Colosseum?

22
00:01:30.608 --> 00:01:34.612
It's complex
intricate system that

23
00:01:35.238 --> 00:01:36.948
Will just continue to evolve.

24
00:01:37.115 --> 00:01:38.433
Hey welcome back this is Fonzo.

25
00:01:38.508 --> 00:01:43.680
I didn't sleep that well last night.
But there's a big reason why.

26
00:01:43.721 --> 00:01:48.685
And I can say that finally I got an
interview with him after more than a year.

27
00:01:48.726 --> 00:01:51.020
The one who invented
the Colosseum.

28
00:01:51.212 --> 00:01:52.238
Enjoy.

29
00:01:54.924 --> 00:01:56.209
Let's see how it's going to be.

30
00:01:58.136 --> 00:02:00.347
There he is. So just get ready.

31
00:02:03.433 --> 00:02:04.726
I'm gonna do you a favor here.

32
00:02:04.726 --> 00:02:06.644
I'm gonna do you a
real good favor here and

33
00:02:06.644 --> 00:02:07.720
I'm gonna tell you

34
00:02:07.812 --> 00:02:08.855
Oh. ok

35
00:02:09.647 --> 00:02:10.731
Yes.

36
00:02:10.807 --> 00:02:13.893
We are having an interview and

37
00:02:13.893 --> 00:02:14.894
You are?

38
00:02:14.894 --> 00:02:17.063
I'm Olga. nice to meet you.

39
00:02:21.743 --> 00:02:23.203
So this is all we have so far?

40
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:31.728
What's up. everybody?

41
00:02:31.728 --> 00:02:34.022
My name is James Boss.

42
00:02:36.132 --> 00:02:40.011
So where do I where do I begin?

43
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.517
I decided to document
this to show the world what it

44
00:02:45.517 --> 00:02:49.646
really means to pursue your
dream what it really means to

45
00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:55.735
take yourself and push
yourself to the edge to go as far

46
00:02:56.111 --> 00:02:57.128
as we can.

47
00:02:57.237 --> 00:02:59.072
You know. I don't
know what it's going to

48
00:02:59.114 --> 00:03:00.740
come out of this.

49
00:03:00.824 --> 00:03:03.910
I don't know what I'm gonna
be. you know filming what I'm

50
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.746
going to be shooting but I
can assure you that it's gonna

51
00:03:06.746 --> 00:03:10.542
be an exciting journey. Martial
arts is something that I've

52
00:03:10.542 --> 00:03:11.626
always been pursuing.

53
00:03:12.043 --> 00:03:17.340
That's when I met Abel.
I met Pedro. I met Eric.

54
00:03:18.716 --> 00:03:21.236
It's probably they're probably
the reason why I'm still here.

55
00:03:21.428 --> 00:03:24.931
Yeah. we're just about to get some
training in ya know light workouts

56
00:03:24.931 --> 00:03:26.023
get in shape.

57
00:03:26.433 --> 00:03:28.143
So yeah. what's up I'm Pedro.

58
00:03:28.143 --> 00:03:30.311
Oh I came from South Africa.

59
00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:32.939
And right now I'm
living out here in Seoul.

60
00:03:37.318 --> 00:03:39.446
Hello my name is Abel Ryu.

61
00:03:39.446 --> 00:03:41.906
I'm from Seoul. South Korea.

62
00:03:41.906 --> 00:03:47.579
My goal is to be the
one. Nice to meet you.

63
00:03:50.665 --> 00:03:53.084
I'm Eric Park. I'm from Chicago.

64
00:03:53.793 --> 00:03:56.045
It's really finding who you are.

65
00:03:56.045 --> 00:03:59.424
Cause that’s all that matters
at the end of your life you know.

66
00:03:59.424 --> 00:04:01.718
Someone else cannot
live a life for you.

67
00:04:01.718 --> 00:04:04.415
I actually find it really
disrespectful when

68
00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:07.515
people kinda condescend
like my life direction.

69
00:04:07.515 --> 00:04:12.645
Typical life of go to a good
University get a good degree.

70
00:04:13.313 --> 00:04:15.148
AAhhhhh!!

71
00:04:15.356 --> 00:04:17.066
My day to day job again.

72
00:04:17.442 --> 00:04:20.236
Yeah. I don't think this
is really my environment.

73
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.446
I don't really belong here.

74
00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:26.618
I saw Bruce Wayne and you
know. I saw Batman and how huge

75
00:04:26.618 --> 00:04:30.205
and jacked he was and I was like.
you know. I want to be like that guy.

76
00:04:44.886 --> 00:04:48.014
JAMES: A lot of people.
they focus on offense.

77
00:04:48.014 --> 00:04:52.281
PEDRO: Yea JAMES: They always
wanna hit harder come in stronger.

78
00:04:52.435 --> 00:04:54.521
JAMES: Defense is
probably more important.

79
00:04:54.521 --> 00:04:57.732
That’s the reason why
Mayweather is undefeated.

80
00:04:57.732 --> 00:04:59.835
PEDRO: Either wear out.
or they're gonna slip up and

81
00:04:59.859 --> 00:05:02.111
there's gonna be an opening.
And then we gonna catch 'em.

82
00:05:02.211 --> 00:05:03.262
One. two. three.

83
00:05:03.312 --> 00:05:06.149
Have proper distance
to be aware of

84
00:05:06.824 --> 00:05:09.327
Right here he can attack me.
Right here then I can hit him

85
00:05:09.827 --> 00:05:11.454
Or I can keep moving.

86
00:05:16.918 --> 00:05:17.919
ABEL: Woah!

87
00:05:44.988 --> 00:05:48.741
This is who I am and I can't
feel bad just to be who I am.

88
00:05:48.908 --> 00:05:55.164
But another side of me is kind of
like can I take on this responsibility?

89
00:05:55.456 --> 00:05:59.919
I think we've got about
two months..two months left.

90
00:06:00.378 --> 00:06:04.215
left to just practice and
try to find a Fight Club.

91
00:06:04.549 --> 00:06:08.636
I know it's a it's not the ideal
situation for us to be practicing

92
00:06:08.636 --> 00:06:11.598
because we don't
have a dojo or anything

93
00:06:11.723 --> 00:06:13.808
We gotta do what we gotta do so.

94
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.643
One. two. three. Fighting! Yea!

95
00:06:22.233 --> 00:06:24.360
Oh hi. how are you!

96
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.361
JAMES: Good good.

97
00:06:25.361 --> 00:06:26.362
JAMES: Long time no see

98
00:06:27.322 --> 00:06:28.397
You doing well?

99
00:06:28.397 --> 00:06:29.473
JAMES: Yea I'm doing good.

100
00:06:30.783 --> 00:06:33.161
I think you're a
bit early but yea.

101
00:06:33.578 --> 00:06:34.587
Let's go.

102
00:06:34.654 --> 00:06:35.746
JAMES: Yea

103
00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:37.915
So that's the place.

104
00:06:39.334 --> 00:06:42.086
I think it's better I
go first. talk to him.

105
00:06:55.433 --> 00:06:59.020
So it's it's pretty expensive
like my services cost money.

106
00:06:59.646 --> 00:07:04.359
But like if you have enough money.
I can become your personal spy

107
00:07:05.109 --> 00:07:06.127
If you need it.

108
00:07:10.114 --> 00:07:14.827
So the cheapest thing the
minimum so it starts like from

109
00:07:14.827 --> 00:07:16.245
0.2 BTC.

110
00:07:16.829 --> 00:07:20.124
It's like for tracking
people then it goes up.

111
00:07:20.249 --> 00:07:23.920
Like I can tell you how much
money people have on the bank

112
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.548
accounts like. you know.
everybody is using internet banking

113
00:07:27.548 --> 00:07:28.632
these days.

114
00:07:29.817 --> 00:07:33.613
I can tell you like really
personal information about people.

115
00:07:34.247 --> 00:07:37.542
I can snatch some files from
the personal computers right?

116
00:07:37.642 --> 00:07:42.814
So if you if you decide to
contact me. this is how you can

117
00:07:42.814 --> 00:07:43.856
contact me.

118
00:07:51.197 --> 00:07:53.116
Guys too slow!

119
00:07:58.413 --> 00:07:59.914
ABEL: Hurry up! Hurry up!

120
00:08:01.541 --> 00:08:02.959
ABEL: James! Pedro!

121
00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:04.085
ABEL: 1. 2. 1. 2!

122
00:08:04.335 --> 00:08:05.744
Let me hold the camera. ABEL: Ok

123
00:08:06.212 --> 00:08:07.763
PEDRO: James hold
up! JAMES: Yea yea

124
00:08:09.298 --> 00:08:10.357
ABEL: Whoo!

125
00:08:18.975 --> 00:08:21.642
ERIC: What the fuck. yo what
the f.. PEDRO: Yo. check that out.

126
00:08:22.603 --> 00:08:23.604
JAMES: Hey!

127
00:08:28.443 --> 00:08:30.403
ERIC: Hey! Stop stop stop stop!

128
00:08:33.865 --> 00:08:35.074
ERIC: Stop stop stop

129
00:08:35.742 --> 00:08:36.767
ERIC: Oh shit

130
00:08:36.801 --> 00:08:38.553
ERIC: Hey hey hey.
don't touch that shit.

131
00:08:39.537 --> 00:08:40.713
ERIC: Get off. get off

132
00:08:43.541 --> 00:08:44.542
ABEL: Help!

133
00:08:47.462 --> 00:08:48.563
JAMES: No just get him out

134
00:08:50.965 --> 00:08:51.966
HOOLIGAN: Let me go!

135
00:08:52.717 --> 00:08:53.734
PEDRO: backup!

136
00:09:10.902 --> 00:09:12.628
Get him out of here.
get him out of here!

137
00:09:12.628 --> 00:09:13.796
ERIC: Hey hey. move!

138
00:09:20.787 --> 00:09:22.413
HOOLIGAN: Hey. bring him here!

139
00:09:29.921 --> 00:09:32.006
JAMES: Make sure
they're not following us.

140
00:10:08.584 --> 00:10:13.172
We did meet a person named X

141
00:10:13.172 --> 00:10:16.843
and he said that he can give
us information but we have to

142
00:10:16.843 --> 00:10:20.346
pay him and I think he's kind
of expensive I think maybe

143
00:10:20.346 --> 00:10:24.809
we can survive for like a month
or month and a half maybe.

144
00:10:27.144 --> 00:10:29.480
And then we have to go
back to working. you know.

145
00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:33.317
Yo what about the guy we saw at
the forest who was filming also like.

146
00:10:33.317 --> 00:10:34.377
What about him.

147
00:10:34.527 --> 00:10:37.405
I mean. he said he knows some
stuff about the dark web too.

148
00:10:37.947 --> 00:10:38.947
Oh. okay.

149
00:10:39.073 --> 00:10:41.534
Maybe I could try
to talk to him or

150
00:10:42.118 --> 00:10:43.953
he might have some connections.

151
00:10:43.953 --> 00:10:45.154
I mean. I don't trust him.

152
00:10:45.288 --> 00:10:46.539
JAMES: Abel. I understand.

153
00:10:46.747 --> 00:10:48.165
Yeah. I'm a little bit worried.

154
00:10:48.165 --> 00:10:51.752
We got..we can just wait.
We still have a month ok.

155
00:10:51.752 --> 00:10:53.796
PEDRO: Noo…our
money is going down.

156
00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.341
Well. it is going down but I'm
saying we can try to get more

157
00:10:57.341 --> 00:10:58.968
information because

158
00:10:58.968 --> 00:11:00.803
We just get information
from him and

159
00:11:00.845 --> 00:11:04.515
then we just leave
that's it just information.

160
00:11:04.515 --> 00:11:05.725
That's all that's all we need.

161
00:11:05.725 --> 00:11:06.725
Right?

162
00:11:06.742 --> 00:11:08.828
So maybe Pedro
can set up a meeting.

163
00:12:11.165 --> 00:12:12.183
ERIC: Abel wake up.

164
00:12:12.875 --> 00:12:15.086
Yea she was training
heavily the other day.

165
00:12:15.628 --> 00:12:18.214
Yeah every day every day.

166
00:12:18.214 --> 00:12:19.214
Yeah.

167
00:12:29.392 --> 00:12:30.718
PEDRO: Do you
guys work together?

168
00:12:35.523 --> 00:12:37.083
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.

169
00:12:44.865 --> 00:12:45.933
Sales.

170
00:12:45.941 --> 00:12:47.276
JAMES: Sales? Oh.

171
00:12:56.168 --> 00:12:57.169
PEDRO: Long time.

172
00:12:57.169 --> 00:12:58.170
Long time?

173
00:13:16.022 --> 00:13:17.056
Nice meeting you.

174
00:14:26.092 --> 00:14:29.220
So it's erased so that we

There's like 3. 4. 5
things going on at once.

178
00:15:31.949 --> 00:15:33.033

00:16:42.311 --> 00:16:46.148
Okay. let's make

00:17:22.518 --> 00:17:23.811
Oh. yeah. Pedro run.

187
00:17:26.939 --> 00:17:28.015
No. no.

188
00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.483
No. it wasn't.

189
00:17:32.027 --> 00:17:36.824
Sorry Pedro! Was me but
you know miscommunication.

190
00:17:36.824 --> 00:17:37.825
It happens all the time.

191
00:17:37.825 --> 00:17:40.619
So remember last
time I was sweating.

192
00:17:40.828 --> 00:17:43.664
I'm going to make him
sweat. you know. Ready?!

193
00:17:45.249 --> 00:17:46.308
No. not yet.

194
00:17:46.625 --> 00:17:48.711
I want to see more
action. you know.

195
00:18:06.937 --> 00:18:07.938
Okay?

196
00:18:33.839 --> 00:18:35.132
Oh yea!

197
00:18:35.132 --> 00:18:36.733
You know when Pedro
was runnin down hill.

198
00:18:36.733 --> 00:18:38.385
He was like 'oh my
knee's my knee's.

199
00:18:58.155 --> 00:18:59.323
Yes!

200
00:18:59.698 --> 00:19:00.699
Kung fu.

201
00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:03.911
It's me!

202
00:19:24.973 --> 00:19:26.475
For sure. Woo!

203
00:19:52.709 --> 00:19:54.627
Good. Cool It's looking good Yea

204
00:19:54.711 --> 00:19:56.046
It's just the first video.

205
00:19:56.338 --> 00:19:59.341
Yea I mean. I think.
let's upload this and

206
00:19:59.925 --> 00:20:00.926
Let's see.

207
00:20:01.427 --> 00:20:04.930
If we can get a fight. Do you think
people will actually like

208
00:20:05.055 --> 00:20:09.560
Yea how do you think the people at the
Colosseum would think after watching this.

209
00:20:10.519 --> 00:20:14.606
Do you think they will be
scared? To tell you the truth. I think

210
00:20:16.108 --> 00:20:19.319
Are we making us look tough
and so that they want to challenge us

211
00:20:19.319 --> 00:20:23.449
or we look just okay to
fight so that they're like yeah

212
00:20:23.449 --> 00:20:25.826
I can win this guy and
then you know make us

213
00:20:25.826 --> 00:20:28.745
I think like from watching
the videos we look kind of

214
00:20:28.745 --> 00:20:31.623
tough but not super tough.
Yeah.

215
00:20:31.623 --> 00:20:32.624
That might be good

216
00:20:32.833 --> 00:20:34.710
Yea that's a good thing

217
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:41.216
I think they will underestimate us
yeah so. Let's upload this and let's

218
00:20:41.216 --> 00:20:45.971
see let's see if we could get a
fight going. Okay all right. Cool.

219
00:20:46.221 --> 00:20:50.184
From the outside. it may sound
crazy. From the outside looking in

220
00:20:50.184 --> 00:20:52.227
you may look somebody
and think they are crazy.

221
00:20:52.603 --> 00:20:55.105
But we live in a world that is

222
00:20:56.899 --> 00:21:00.486
skewed. stacked
against people like me.

223
00:21:02.154 --> 00:21:04.615
But I've created a world
of my own right now.

224
00:21:06.325 --> 00:21:09.411
Where I can live. walk and
roam free and do what I will.

225
00:21:10.245 --> 00:21:11.538
I set the rules.

226
00:21:11.747 --> 00:21:13.540
It's my universe my kingdom.

227
00:21:14.416 --> 00:21:16.502
I'm Thanos here. I
can do whatever I want.

228
00:21:16.752 --> 00:21:17.753
I had basic

229
00:21:18.712 --> 00:21:21.840
programming skills that
helped me out of the beginning.

230
00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.009
But other than that.

231
00:21:25.511 --> 00:21:29.640
The tough thing was basically
getting the first few fights.

232
00:21:29.932 --> 00:21:31.808
And then getting people to bet.

233
00:21:33.227 --> 00:21:34.811
Finding big rollers.

234
00:21:34.811 --> 00:21:37.940
That was one of the key things
so I had to keep team pretty

235
00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:42.110
small to begin with and then
after a few things happened.

236
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:43.111
you know.

237
00:21:44.947 --> 00:21:47.241
News began to spread
on the the dark web.

238
00:21:53.622 --> 00:21:55.322
Okay. We got one minute.

239
00:21:59.753 --> 00:22:00.879
My mask.

240
00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:08.011
Do I look. do I
look kinda weird?

241
00:22:09.346 --> 00:22:11.139
All right. let's try this.

242
00:22:17.646 --> 00:22:18.822
What's going on?

243
00:22:21.441 --> 00:22:22.534
What is this?

244
00:22:23.318 --> 00:22:29.032
What's what's what we're
supposed to talk about the fight.

245
00:22:29.032 --> 00:22:30.216
Yeah. Yeah.

246
00:22:30.242 --> 00:22:33.620

me to you. but look.

247
00:22:34.913 --> 00:22:38.625

249
00:22:41.545 --> 00:22:42.637

253
00:22:47.426 --> 00:22:48.435
Anyway.

254
00:22:48.518 --> 00:22:51.847
Yeah. so I saw some of your
trailers Soowoo showed me some of

255
00:22:51.847 --> 00:22:54.808
your trailers and I don't know
if I can work with that man.

256
00:22:54.808 --> 00:22:58.020
I mean. they're cool and
everything but you know.

257
00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.814
it's not a movie that
you're making right?

258
00:23:01.148 --> 00:23:05.944
Yeah me that's it's it's what
we were able to work with right

259
00:23:05.944 --> 00:23:08.739
now at this moment. but you
know. we've been we've been ready

260
00:23:08.739 --> 00:23:09.823
for this all our lives.

261
00:23:10.032 --> 00:23:11.049
You have to

262
00:23:11.325 --> 00:23:14.328
You got a day job you
and your friends got like

263
00:23:14.745 --> 00:23:15.829
day jobs and stuff.

264
00:23:16.622 --> 00:23:17.631
Not anymore.

265
00:23:17.631 --> 00:23:20.417
No. I mean we're
like we're all in.

266
00:23:20.417 --> 00:23:21.543
We're all in this man.

267
00:23:21.627 --> 00:23:24.338
We just need our first break.

268
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:29.384
So looking for a promoter who
can put this together. you know.

269
00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:31.136
Oh wow.

270
00:23:31.345 --> 00:23:32.428
Oh wow. All right.

271
00:23:33.138 --> 00:23:34.640
No. I know I got it.

272
00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:35.715
I got it.

273
00:23:35.715 --> 00:23:37.008
You know. I was there too.

274
00:23:37.017 --> 00:23:39.728
You know how it
works is the fighters

275
00:23:39.728 --> 00:23:41.654
JAMES: So the way that
this game works. ERIC: Yea

276
00:23:41.655 --> 00:23:43.500
JAMES: I just found out
yesterday while talking

277
00:23:43.524 --> 00:23:45.167
to one of the guys.
one of the managers.

278
00:23:45.208 --> 00:23:50.614
ERIC: Okay JAMES: Is there's.
so people who are betting online

279
00:23:50.614 --> 00:23:54.910
they can make around
twice. two times what they bet.

280
00:23:54.910 --> 00:24:01.208
But people who are fighting. we
invest our own money in the fight

281
00:24:01.291 --> 00:24:07.047
We invest in ourselves. but if we win.
we can win up to 10 times what we invest.

282
00:24:07.047 --> 00:24:09.091
So the way I calculated it

283
00:24:09.132 --> 00:24:11.093
is we have

284
00:24:12.761 --> 00:24:14.137
$2.000 right now.

285
00:24:14.221 --> 00:24:17.641
Yeah. this is our money.
right if we win our first fight

286
00:24:17.724 --> 00:24:21.019
we turn that into $20.000.

287
00:24:21.144 --> 00:24:23.814
Yeah. right then from here.

288
00:24:23.939 --> 00:24:26.316
So I'm trying to play safe so
we don't lose too much money.

289
00:24:26.733 --> 00:24:31.113
And that will give us a
total of 4 million dollars.

290
00:24:34.032 --> 00:24:37.119
So that's one two.
three. four five fights.

291
00:24:37.327 --> 00:24:42.916
We have four million dollars
and each of us can leave this

292
00:24:42.916 --> 00:24:44.209
game with a million dollars.

293
00:24:44.209 --> 00:24:46.336
So one mill each.

294
00:24:46.336 --> 00:24:51.133
Wow. what do you think Pedro.
you down. it's a million dollars each.

295
00:24:51.133 --> 00:24:54.720
That's that's that's pretty much.
Dude 5 fights and you

296
00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:59.808
have a million dollar in
your pocket Just five fights?

297
00:25:00.225 --> 00:25:03.478
one. two. three. four five. but
we have to win all of these fights.

298
00:25:03.645 --> 00:25:05.439
Can you win. Wow. I'm gonna win.

299
00:25:05.522 --> 00:25:06.614
Yes.

300
00:25:07.232 --> 00:25:10.819
But just know that you lose a fight
you don't walk away with anything.

301
00:25:11.403 --> 00:25:13.530
I see all or nothing.

302
00:25:14.322 --> 00:25:15.323
It is all or nothing.

303
00:25:16.241 --> 00:25:17.743
So do what you got to do buddy.

Now. you're gonna
find a real man for once.

314
00:25:42.726 --> 00:25:43.935

This is real men

Nothing can happen.

318
00:25:49.649 --> 00:25:51.443
Nothing can bad happen to me.

319
00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:54.946
Nobody can broke me. I can
broke everybody with the real will.

320
00:25:55.238 --> 00:25:57.616
I'm gonna show you that I'm
fearless you're gonna see that

321
00:25:57.616 --> 00:26:00.035
soon. I don't have
any fear from anyone.

322
00:26:01.244 --> 00:26:02.304
Fucking bitch.

323
00:26:52.838 --> 00:26:55.632
JAMES: Nasiir he has
really good boxing skills.

324
00:26:56.049 --> 00:27:00.136
JAMES: When he throws kicks. it's usually
jump kicks or kinda like flashy kicks.

325
00:27:00.136 --> 00:27:03.181
PEDRO: Yeah JAMES:He kind of
seems to neglect below the waist.

326
00:27:03.849 --> 00:27:06.226
JAMES: And he doesn't
seem to guard himself very well.

327
00:27:06.226 --> 00:27:07.427
Let's say this is his thigh.

328
00:27:09.312 --> 00:27:11.898
And then suddenly
PEDRO: And then I move up?

329
00:27:11.982 --> 00:27:14.309
Yea you move up. Boom boom
boom. keep attacking his head.

330
00:27:14.376 --> 00:27:16.419
PEDRO: I think cause I
have a reach advantage too.

331
00:27:16.503 --> 00:27:18.738
I can keep him at
Bay by throwing kicks.

332
00:27:18.738 --> 00:27:20.115
He tries to come too close.

333
00:27:20.115 --> 00:27:22.325
And working at close range.

334
00:27:22.617 --> 00:27:23.927
I can just keep throwing kicks.

335
00:27:26.913 --> 00:27:29.040
Arm out and then go in.

336
00:27:49.686 --> 00:27:53.231
Boom you grab him.
boom you elbow him.

337
00:27:59.029 --> 00:28:00.121
Okay one more.

338
00:28:01.448 --> 00:28:02.449
It's just familiarity.

339
00:28:04.117 --> 00:28:05.452
Familiar with stuff.

340
00:28:25.013 --> 00:28:29.226
Basically. we've been
waiting for this moment and I'm not

341
00:28:29.726 --> 00:28:34.522
good at these motivational
speeches. but basically let's

342
00:28:35.231 --> 00:28:39.319
stick to the plan and
let's make it happen.

343
00:28:39.319 --> 00:28:40.528
Just don't get injured.

344
00:28:40.737 --> 00:28:45.492
Don't get exhausted stay focused
and I know you guys could do it.

345
00:28:46.284 --> 00:28:47.911

Let's go

375
00:31:10.637 --> 00:31:11.729
Come on.

376
00:31:17.811 --> 00:31:18.861
Oh shit!

377
00:31:39.666 --> 00:31:44.337
Yes. that's what I'm talking
about yes. clean shot.

378
00:31:45.672 --> 00:31:46.673
Oh shit.

379
00:34:22.912 --> 00:34:23.930
Okay. take a break.

380
00:34:24.013 --> 00:34:25.014
It's ok harder harder.

381
00:34:25.415 --> 00:34:27.632
I don't wanna. no I don't
want to. It's ok I got it.

382
00:34:27.709 --> 00:34:28.718
All right.

383
00:34:28.718 --> 00:34:32.013
Well. he said it
right I'm going.

384
00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:33.131
Ready.

385
00:34:39.804 --> 00:34:41.922
I think you need to duck
your head a little more.

386
00:34:46.644 --> 00:34:48.503
And then he's gonna
throw a couple punches.

387
00:34:48.938 --> 00:34:49.939
Yea like that.

388
00:34:56.446 --> 00:34:57.447
Stun. knock out

389
00:35:01.617 --> 00:35:03.494
I'm gonna go boxing.

390
00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:07.165
And then throw
the kicks in later.

391
00:35:07.649 --> 00:35:10.043
And hopefully I could get him
off guard and get like a nice

392
00:35:10.043 --> 00:35:11.044
kick to the face.

393
00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:15.615
He's usually more with his
hands and I think I should be good.

394
00:35:21.679 --> 00:35:22.930
JAMES: How do you feel Eric?

395
00:35:23.431 --> 00:35:24.432
I'm good man.

396
00:35:35.151 --> 00:35:38.696
JAMES: So this is our
fight location for today.

397
00:35:51.459 --> 00:35:52.460
JAMES: It's ok.

398
00:35:56.255 --> 00:35:58.165
JAMES: What do you
think. I can just fight.

399
00:36:17.902 --> 00:36:21.364
You can call it off man. I mean
you don't. It's gambling man.

400
00:36:21.364 --> 00:36:22.949
You don't want
to lose this fight.

403
00:36:52.645 --> 00:36:56.232
I think James is
going to win. I think so.

404
00:37:14.917 --> 00:37:17.128
Oh. oh. oh. oh. No.

405

00:47:44.129 --> 00:47:46.799
ABEL: Eric get
out. get out. Eric!

522
00:47:47.508 --> 00:47:48.509
ABEL: Eric?!

523
00:47:52.137 --> 00:47:53.138
ABEL: Eric?!

524
00:47:58.727 --> 00:47:59.728
JAMES: Oh damn.

525
00:47:59.728 --> 00:48:01.730
JAMES: Eric? Eric.

526
00:48:03.065 --> 00:48:05.192
JAMES: That's ok.
just give him some time.

527
00:48:06.110 --> 00:48:07.119
JAMES: He's gonna recover

528
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:11.573
JAMES: He's
breathing he's breathing.

529
00:48:11.573 --> 00:48:12.582
It's ok?

530
00:48:13.283 --> 00:48:14.284
JAMES: Jesus.

531
00:48:17.621 --> 00:48:18.639
I'm all right.

532
00:48:18.914 --> 00:48:20.040
It's an honor to meet you.

533
00:48:20.541 --> 00:48:21.625
It's an honor to meet you.

534
00:48:24.545 --> 00:48:25.637
I got to admit.

535
00:48:25.637 --> 00:48:30.834
I didn't think much of you the
first time but your boy Pedro.

536
00:48:30.926 --> 00:48:32.136
I think he's got something.

537
00:48:33.345 --> 00:48:35.439
I think we can make
something interesting happened.

538
00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:36.614
What do you say?

539
00:48:36.849 --> 00:48:37.908
Yeah. definitely.

540
00:48:38.016 --> 00:48:39.434
I'm all in for it.

541
00:48:40.144 --> 00:48:41.219
Okay very good.

542
00:48:41.436 --> 00:48:44.648
I think we need something next
week and I could put up a good fight.

543
00:48:45.315 --> 00:48:48.986
I have this guy Hitman. and I
think they make a really good show.

544
00:48:49.695 --> 00:48:50.712
Okay.

545
00:48:50.946 --> 00:48:53.323
Okay. just curious.

546
00:48:53.323 --> 00:48:57.119
But you know. is there
any way that I can get any

547
00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:02.416
previous footage of Hitman's
fights like previous fights.

548
00:49:02.416 --> 00:49:03.433
Is that possible?

549
00:49:05.043 --> 00:49:06.311
I can make that happen for you.

550
00:49:07.629 --> 00:49:09.715
But I need Pedro
ready in 5 days.

551
00:49:10.841 --> 00:49:11.849
Okay. Can you do that?

552
00:49:11.925 --> 00:49:14.178
Yeah. I'll definitely do that.

553
00:49:15.137 --> 00:49:16.138
PEDRO: Be humble

554
00:49:26.648 --> 00:49:27.649
Are you Joshua?

555
00:49:27.649 --> 00:49:28.650
Yes I am Joshua.

556
00:49:28.650 --> 00:49:29.651
Your name is?

557
00:49:30.027 --> 00:49:31.445
James? Nice to meet you James.

558
00:49:33.614 --> 00:49:34.740
I think it's better.

559
00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:35.949
I introduce myself.

560
00:49:36.533 --> 00:49:39.870
So my name is Josh and
I'm sent here by Mr Bix.

561
00:49:41.121 --> 00:49:44.249
Yes. and my purpose
here is to find Pedro.

562
00:49:44.249 --> 00:49:45.417
I believe it's you.

563
00:49:45.834 --> 00:49:48.361
Nice to meet you And the
gentleman over here. what's your name?

564
00:49:48.545 --> 00:49:50.839
Soowoo Soowoo?
Nice to meet you too

565
00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:56.929
Now. what we're going to do
is go to a studio. which I rented

566
00:49:56.929 --> 00:49:59.139
outside and for about one hour.

567
00:49:59.139 --> 00:50:01.767
I think we should be able to
shoot a very nice promotional.

568
00:50:01.876 --> 00:50:03.085
video for you.

569
00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:05.451
Mr.Pedro Yeah. I need you
all to be excited about this.

570
00:50:07.113 --> 00:50:08.323
Yeah. Are you guys excited?

571
00:50:08.649 --> 00:50:09.741
Let's go.

572
00:50:09.741 --> 00:50:10.742
Okay. let's do it.

573
00:50:16.031 --> 00:50:19.826
I'm going to need you to make
me. you know different poses.

574
00:50:20.035 --> 00:50:21.119
Maybe punch.

575
00:50:21.127 --> 00:50:22.629
I may need a punch.

576
00:50:32.214 --> 00:50:33.306
What's Happening here?

577
00:50:52.109 --> 00:50:54.438
After this first fight.
after my first victory

578
00:50:54.462 --> 00:50:56.738
I feel like I just wanna
keep on doing this.

579
00:50:57.823 --> 00:51:01.326
I want to fight again as soon
as possible get back to training.

580
00:51:01.535 --> 00:51:02.661
I just want to keep going.

581
00:51:20.762 --> 00:51:23.432
To really be about that
life is a different story

582
00:51:31.231 --> 00:51:34.609
Yeah. let's just practice some
hand traps and some Judo moves.

583
00:51:35.027 --> 00:51:37.612
A lot of people who
fight bigger people

584
00:51:37.612 --> 00:51:39.323
They usually try to
get them on the back.

585
00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:42.117
So I think if you get him
on his back then I think

586
00:51:42.117 --> 00:51:43.327
we have a good chance.

587
00:51:44.328 --> 00:51:45.328
All right.

588
00:51:47.122 --> 00:51:48.139
Yeah.

589
00:51:52.544 --> 00:51:56.631
The force that you're generating.
Your kinda going with that force.

590
00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:58.467
So your just kinda going boom.

591
00:51:58.884 --> 00:51:59.985
It's kinda like a bear hug.

592
00:52:00.135 --> 00:52:03.930
Put you leg right here and boom.

593
00:52:09.227 --> 00:52:14.816
You can punch. but bring
it down after you punch.

594
00:52:14.816 --> 00:52:16.610
We never know exactly
how it's gonna go.

595
00:52:16.610 --> 00:52:20.030
So these are kind of emergency
moves that were just gonna

596
00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:21.114
prepare.

597
00:52:28.038 --> 00:52:34.211
This time let's try going for
the punch and then grapple.

598
00:52:34.211 --> 00:52:38.215
it feels like I'm getting
more power more energy.

599
00:52:39.424 --> 00:52:41.843
And even this like
everything right now.

600
00:52:41.843 --> 00:52:43.345
It doesn't look real to me.

601
00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:45.013
Like are we doing?

602
00:52:45.013 --> 00:52:46.247
Okay? I know I don't think so.

603
00:52:46.339 --> 00:52:48.141
This is like a joke.

604
00:52:48.141 --> 00:52:49.434
It's not like serious training.

605
00:52:49.434 --> 00:52:53.146
It's not like formal training
that we have to go through.

606
00:52:53.313 --> 00:52:58.318
The undefeated champion
of the dark web. Soowoo.

607
00:52:58.777 --> 00:52:59.778
You feel good? Yea.

608
00:53:01.405 --> 00:53:04.116
I just need you to really be
careful you know because

609
00:53:04.616 --> 00:53:07.035
I don't think you've ever
fought a guy this big before.

610
00:53:07.119 --> 00:53:11.248
Yeah. and I don't know if you
can if you can adjust to that

611
00:53:11.248 --> 00:53:12.324
kind of mass.

612
00:53:12.349 --> 00:53:14.626
Yeah. as long as my
mind is in the right place.

613
00:53:14.626 --> 00:53:15.627
I should be all right.

614
00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:16.744
Yeah.

615
00:53:18.839 --> 00:53:22.801
I just think you need to
be a little more. you know

616
00:53:24.094 --> 00:53:25.145
careful.

617
00:53:25.211 --> 00:53:27.714
Yeah next time just I'll
I'll train harder and better.

618
00:53:27.722 --> 00:53:28.849
Let's see what happens.

619
00:53:29.224 --> 00:53:30.508
I'm just gonna win it. you know.

620
00:53:31.643 --> 00:53:34.020
That's what McGregor
said. you know. fuck it.

621
00:53:35.522 --> 00:53:38.942
You know how like a some
fighters do flips after they win?

622
00:53:38.942 --> 00:53:40.235
Yeah. I'm gonna do a flip.

623
00:53:40.735 --> 00:53:41.827
Okay.

624
00:53:43.321 --> 00:53:44.322
Whoa.

625
00:53:49.244 --> 00:53:50.245
SOOWOO: Awesome

626
00:56:28.236 --> 00:56:30.864
Hey I just got back from
fighting the Hitman but

627
00:56:30.864 --> 00:56:34.868
so far it was the toughest
fight I've had in my life and

628
00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:38.705
I won I came out victorious.

629
00:56:40.373 --> 00:56:43.251
And yea I did
sustain some injuries.

630
00:56:45.045 --> 00:56:46.329
That's part of the fight game.

631
00:56:46.329 --> 00:56:47.747
That's what it's about.

632
00:56:48.214 --> 00:56:50.216
Like. we know what
we signed up for.

633
00:56:50.216 --> 00:56:57.349
So we did everything we could
yeah. we came out on top even

634
00:56:57.349 --> 00:57:02.437
though it was a really tough
fight and I did sustain some

635
00:57:02.437 --> 00:57:04.731
injuries. but it's
nothing too bad.

636
00:57:06.316 --> 00:57:10.612
It's kind of bad actually.
like my wrist can get better.

637
00:57:10.612 --> 00:57:13.239
But like there's a chance.

638
00:57:13.239 --> 00:57:16.910
It's not even going to heal so
well and same for my shoulder.

639
00:57:17.327 --> 00:57:19.287
It's torn pretty badly.

640
00:57:19.746 --> 00:57:22.582
And he said I actually
shouldn't fight anymore.

641
00:57:25.377 --> 00:57:28.963
Like my body is completely
going against me right now.

642
00:57:30.548 --> 00:57:32.133
That's just the reality.

643
00:57:37.639 --> 00:57:38.648
All right.

644
00:57:41.434 --> 00:57:47.732
Just hope nobody no one else
gets injured and I think everything

645
00:57:47.732 --> 00:57:48.733
will be okay.

646
00:58:02.414 --> 00:58:03.431
Ok take care of yourself.

647
00:58:03.431 --> 00:58:04.682
Yea Have a safe flight. and yea

648
00:58:04.833 --> 00:58:06.292
Okay. and I'll be healthy.

649
00:58:06.584 --> 00:58:07.585
Try not to get injured.

650
00:58:08.545 --> 00:58:09.795
Don't go too hard on yourself.

651
00:58:10.213 --> 00:58:11.423
I need to hurry up.

652
00:58:11.631 --> 00:58:13.925
Yeah. I need to make sure
my luggage is not overweight.

653
00:58:20.098 --> 00:58:22.809
Ok ok Take care of the guys and

654
00:58:23.977 --> 00:58:24.978
Abel's not coming? or

655
00:58:25.478 --> 00:58:26.938
I don't think so.

656
00:58:27.147 --> 00:58:29.149
I mean she's not
picking up her phone.

657
00:58:29.232 --> 00:58:30.324
Yeah.

658
00:59:13.693 --> 00:59:14.694
Alright bro.

659
00:59:14.861 --> 00:59:15.862
I'm a head out now.

660
00:59:15.862 --> 00:59:16.863
For sure.

661
00:59:17.572 --> 00:59:18.615
I'll hit you up Yea.

662
00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:20.316
Yea.

663
00:59:30.418 --> 00:59:31.836
ERIC: Like 3 p.m.

664
00:59:33.505 --> 00:59:34.506
Yea I know.

665
00:59:36.132 --> 00:59:37.133
Nothing.

666
00:59:37.133 --> 00:59:38.835
Just couldn't sleep.

667
00:59:39.010 --> 00:59:40.637
There's this red room

668
00:59:41.763 --> 00:59:43.932
and I found something shady

669
00:59:44.933 --> 00:59:47.644
Just getting like bunch
of invitations and stuff.

670
00:59:48.436 --> 00:59:51.397
And I found something
I don't know interesting.

671
00:59:53.191 --> 00:59:55.985
You know. you remember
back in like a couple of years ago.

672
00:59:56.069 --> 00:59:58.404
You fought this big
guy called Jaehyung.

673
00:59:59.239 --> 01:00:03.618
Ok yea Umm..I think I found him.

674
01:00:03.993 --> 01:00:04.994
Really.

675
01:00:06.329 --> 01:00:08.131
Yes. I think he's the
champion or something.

676
01:00:08.139 --> 01:00:10.975
Like. he's got the title.

677
01:00:13.711 --> 01:00:18.341
Well for me. I guess I would like
to become legit and bare-knuckle

678
01:00:18.341 --> 01:00:19.717
fighting is the ultimate.

679
01:00:20.343 --> 01:00:22.136
It's the highest risk. Legit

680
01:00:22.136 --> 01:00:25.849
MMA competitions it's
difficult to get into those

681
01:00:25.849 --> 01:00:28.434
cards. The money
is also not as good.

682
01:00:28.518 --> 01:00:32.230
The reward is worth the
risk of bare knuckle fighting.

683
01:00:32.522 --> 01:00:36.426
I'm trying to win and get the
submission with doing the least amount

684
01:00:36.426 --> 01:00:37.443
of damage possible.

685
01:00:37.443 --> 01:00:41.239
So playing the rubber guard.
you know. lock down electric

686
01:00:41.239 --> 01:00:44.325
chair any of that kind of
stuff omopalate gogopalate

687
01:00:44.325 --> 01:00:47.245
triangle get them an arm
bar submit them. it's exciting.

688
01:00:47.245 --> 01:00:52.125
It's a challenge. Make sure you
know what I'm bringing because

689
01:00:52.709 --> 01:00:55.712
I'll catch you when you don’t
expect it. you think that you

690
01:00:55.712 --> 01:00:57.213
can just smash me.

691
01:00:57.722 --> 01:01:00.333
You can try you might get a few
shots. but you better be careful.

692
01:01:00.333 --> 01:01:02.835
My friends and my family.
it's number one for me.

693
01:02:31.224 --> 01:02:32.809
James. why the call?

694
01:02:33.309 --> 01:02:35.969
I'm wondering if we can
create some kind of package

695
01:02:35.993 --> 01:02:38.439
deal where we can fight
some of your fighters.

696
01:02:38.856 --> 01:02:41.067
Okay. who are your people?

697
01:02:41.609 --> 01:02:43.111
I'm sure you've seen our fights.

698
01:02:45.029 --> 01:02:46.113
Yea yea yea.

699
01:02:50.535 --> 01:02:52.120
Alright. I think we
can do something.

700
01:02:52.412 --> 01:02:56.833
Ok. so Alright. I
got my boy Nemesis.

701
01:02:57.208 --> 01:02:58.226
Okay familiar.

702
01:02:58.626 --> 01:03:01.838
Hmm you and Nemesis I
think will be pretty good.

703
01:03:02.547 --> 01:03:03.840
Let me be honest with you here.

704
01:03:03.923 --> 01:03:09.637
So I got a fighter Sammy. she's
the toughest girl I have all right.

705
01:03:11.347 --> 01:03:14.517
Nah. Abel's not quite up to par.

706
01:03:16.019 --> 01:03:17.069
So

707
01:03:18.146 --> 01:03:19.230
I don't know.

708
01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:21.315
I need to see at least
one more fight out of Abel.

709
01:03:22.233 --> 01:03:23.234
All right.

710
01:03:23.818 --> 01:03:27.447
Yeah. she's really got to show
me that she has what it takes

711
01:03:27.447 --> 01:03:28.531
to go up against Sammy.

712
01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:33.327
Abel. she's really gotta come
through. really gotta impress me.

713
01:03:33.327 --> 01:03:34.328
Before I put Sammy.

714
01:03:34.746 --> 01:03:36.080
I don't wanna waste Sammy's time.

715
01:03:36.122 --> 01:03:37.540
I don't waste my time.

716
01:03:37.623 --> 01:03:41.836
All right. make sure you
and your girl understand that.

717
01:03:42.336 --> 01:03:47.675
Throw in 13%. 1
week. for the first fight

718
01:03:47.675 --> 01:03:48.676
13 percent?

719
01:03:48.718 --> 01:03:49.718
And you got my deal.

720
01:03:51.637 --> 01:03:52.847
We'll work with that.

721
01:03:53.723 --> 01:03:59.729
This is what matters. The atmosphere
induces a sense of calmness.

722
01:04:04.817 --> 01:04:06.110
When I come here I can think.

723
01:04:09.030 --> 01:04:11.949
When I come here. I
have space. I have time.

724
01:04:16.746 --> 01:04:17.830
Everything sits still.

725
01:04:20.708 --> 01:04:24.712
I'm the youngest of three. three
brothers. two older successful

726
01:04:24.712 --> 01:04:27.131
brothers. you know. I was
always an under-shadow.

727
01:04:27.924 --> 01:04:32.345
I always had to work twice as
hard especially to get my father's

728
01:04:32.345 --> 01:04:37.642
attention. you know. I was
so driven into this into this

729
01:04:37.642 --> 01:04:39.018
rage that I forgot

730
01:04:39.644 --> 01:04:42.021
who even won the fight and
that wasn't important. it didn't

731
01:04:42.021 --> 01:04:43.030
even matter.

732
01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:48.945
What mattered was the feeling
that I had. the urge the drive

733
01:04:49.445 --> 01:04:50.530
just to win.

734
01:04:51.322 --> 01:04:52.532
I never felt that before.

735
01:04:53.616 --> 01:04:57.036
But I'm looking more into new
styles. styles that fit my type.

736
01:04:57.620 --> 01:05:00.832
My body. my speed. my strengths.

737
01:05:03.126 --> 01:05:08.631
Looking more into Krav Maga.
Even the defense set you up for

738
01:05:08.631 --> 01:05:09.632
the counter.

739
01:05:15.429 --> 01:05:17.932
Steady diet and
lots of meditation.

740
01:05:18.224 --> 01:05:24.230
I'm all in it for Self-satisfaction
and if you're smart competitor.

741
01:05:25.022 --> 01:05:26.440
you'll be studying me right now.

742
01:05:28.025 --> 01:05:30.518
ERIC: What's the risk like?
Yeah. what you going to do James.

743
01:05:30.544 --> 01:05:31.611
ERIC: Like I don't know.

744
01:05:31.636 --> 01:05:32.820
What is that?

745
01:05:35.741 --> 01:05:38.244
ERIC: You can see
like bleeding and stuff.

746
01:05:43.249 --> 01:05:47.420
Whoa man. I wouldn't
do that for a million bucks.

747
01:05:48.629 --> 01:05:50.463
Let's catch up to X.

748
01:05:53.092 --> 01:05:54.302
X: Nemesis owns this club.

749
01:05:55.678 --> 01:05:56.679
Don't let him see you.

750
01:05:57.513 --> 01:05:58.531
Don't talk to him.

751
01:05:58.639 --> 01:05:59.715
Don't interact with him.

752
01:06:00.433 --> 01:06:02.435
And if anything happens
you don't know me.

753
01:06:02.935 --> 01:06:04.145
Alright man.

754
01:06:29.212 --> 01:06:30.338
Okay. James.

755
01:06:30.421 --> 01:06:32.215
We got our camera back.

756
01:06:32.715 --> 01:06:34.133
Let's get the fuck out of here.

757
01:06:36.219 --> 01:06:39.180
I got this alright. ERIC:
Dude. you don't. dude.

758
01:06:40.431 --> 01:06:42.049
ERIC: You don't know
what's in there man.

759
01:06:42.308 --> 01:06:44.352
ERIC: You don't have to
fight like this I'm fighting

760
01:06:44.376 --> 01:06:46.420
this guy anyways. so let
me just get this over with.

761
01:06:46.462 --> 01:06:48.964
ERIC: Dude you’re going to
fight in the future. don't fight now

762
01:06:49.014 --> 01:06:51.749
ERIC: Why do you want to
JAMES: I want to get this over with. Okay.

763
01:06:51.816 --> 01:06:54.194
Right now is the time.

764
01:06:54.904 --> 01:06:56.614
Ahh..bad decision.

765
01:07:01.619 --> 01:07:02.628
So sketchy.

766
01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.042
I’m not

767
01:07:21.347 --> 01:07:22.414
Are you serious?

768
01:07:45.413 --> 01:07:46.414
James?

769
01:08:47.725 --> 01:08:50.728
Dude James your
done man. Let's go man.

770
01:08:52.063 --> 01:08:54.148
Your fine. almost
there. One more floor

771
01:08:54.899 --> 01:08:57.151
Oh sh.. yo. You’re bleeding.

772
01:09:04.116 --> 01:09:05.442
Let's just get out of here man.

773
01:09:09.121 --> 01:09:10.239
Mr Bix.

774
01:09:12.917 --> 01:09:13.918
So what happened buddy?

775
01:09:15.711 --> 01:09:18.839
I was just I don't know.

776
01:09:18.839 --> 01:09:24.140
I don't know. I'm still trying to remember
exactly what happened

777
01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:25.237
It was.

778
01:09:26.347 --> 01:09:30.768
Somehow I bumped
into Nemesis and

779
01:09:31.143 --> 01:09:33.145
we just ended up fighting
right then and there.

780
01:09:35.439 --> 01:09:38.109
You somehow bumped

781
01:09:38.109 --> 01:09:39.318
I'm a little hazy right now

782
01:09:39.527 --> 01:09:40.694
into Nemesis.

783
01:09:42.321 --> 01:09:46.909
And your recollection is hazy.

784
01:09:48.828 --> 01:09:50.246
Yeah come on James.

785
01:09:51.122 --> 01:09:52.331
You can do better than that.

786
01:09:53.833 --> 01:09:59.713
You motherfucker you
cock sucking motherfucker.

787
01:09:59.839 --> 01:10:03.509
Do you have any fucking idea?

788
01:10:04.427 --> 01:10:09.223
What you have done. do you
have any fucking idea how much

789
01:10:09.348 --> 01:10:10.349
you have lost me?

790
01:10:10.433 --> 01:10:15.438
How much you have cost me.
My reputation you motherfucker.

791
01:10:20.609 --> 01:10:21.618
Mr Bix.

792
01:10:22.111 --> 01:10:25.531
I'll make it up to you.
You are through you are never

793
01:10:25.823 --> 01:10:28.325
ever working with us ever again.

794
01:10:28.826 --> 01:10:29.835
Goodbye.

795
01:10:31.245 --> 01:10:32.246
Get yourself together.

796
01:10:37.835 --> 01:10:38.911
I mean I won the fight

797
01:10:38.911 --> 01:10:40.713
I feel I felt great
at the moment.

798
01:10:40.713 --> 01:10:41.730
I felt good.

799
01:10:41.730 --> 01:10:44.341
I felt like I did the right
thing and I don't know there's

800
01:10:44.341 --> 01:10:48.220
something about myself
that I don't even understand.

801
01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:52.349
Other than that.
Was a good fight.

802
01:10:52.808 --> 01:10:54.935
Good work.
Guys actually impressed me.

803
01:10:54.935 --> 01:10:57.730
I didn't think you guys were
gonna put on the show that you

804
01:10:57.730 --> 01:10:59.648
did but everybody seemed happy.

805
01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:02.142
What do you think you ready
for round two. you want to

806
01:11:02.142 --> 01:11:03.644
make you wanna make
some more money.

807
01:11:03.736 --> 01:11:07.531
You've ever heard
of a guy named the Mongolian?

808
01:11:42.525 --> 01:11:48.322
He actually went up against
the champ Jae-hyung and I'm not

809
01:11:48.322 --> 01:11:52.326
going to lie. he came pretty close
to doing some serious damage.

810
01:11:52.743 --> 01:11:55.913
So with that comes a lot of
betting with that comes a lot

811
01:11:55.913 --> 01:11:56.930
of money.

812
01:11:56.930 --> 01:12:03.128
What I'm thinking is you
and him. This next fight

813
01:12:03.128 --> 01:12:04.547
was one that
actually came to me.

814
01:12:05.214 --> 01:12:09.635
Okay the girl named Sammy
Sammy wants to take on Abel.

815
01:12:11.528 --> 01:12:13.570
I do this shit because I'm
good at this shit.

816
01:12:13.639 --> 01:12:14.757
That's why I do this shit.

817
01:12:15.224 --> 01:12:16.642
I was born a weak kid.

818
01:12:16.642 --> 01:12:18.352
I got in and out of the hospital.

819
01:12:18.519 --> 01:12:20.563
I had to fight
just to stay alive.

820
01:12:20.563 --> 01:12:21.564
From like day one.

821
01:12:23.649 --> 01:12:26.235
My body just couldn't take
it and then I forced my body

822
01:12:26.235 --> 01:12:30.823
to take it. Now turns out my
dad was a motherfucker. And like

823
01:12:30.823 --> 01:12:35.119
to beat the shit out of us. And I
learned real quick like you can

824
01:12:35.119 --> 01:12:38.539
bow you can take it you can
bow but no matter how low you

825
01:12:38.539 --> 01:12:44.837
bow. They only stop hitting
you when you get back.

826
01:12:45.546 --> 01:12:48.841
is Sammy]

827
01:12:48.841 --> 01:12:53.012
I'm a fighter from this
part of town.

828
01:12:53.929 --> 01:12:55.014
I'm here for fight.

829
01:12:55.139 --> 01:12:59.018
What do you want me to
do sit in a cubicle type a little

830
01:12:59.018 --> 01:13:01.937
on the fucking computer when
I get to travel the world kick

831
01:13:01.937 --> 01:13:03.939
motherfuckers ass
get paid go party.

832
01:13:05.441 --> 01:13:10.529
Like why. is a good life. Well
I've studied a bunch of disciplines.

833
01:13:10.529 --> 01:13:15.242
but Definitely Muay Thai Fighter
like it's I've trained in Thailand.

834
01:13:15.409 --> 01:13:16.619
The art of the eight limbs.

835
01:13:16.619 --> 01:13:22.124
So you got like piss your
elbows your knees your kicks.

836
01:13:22.249 --> 01:13:25.336
So the eight limbs in half an
hour. you can teach everyone

837
01:13:25.336 --> 01:13:31.008
the moves and then it's
just repeat repeat repeat.

838
01:13:31.008 --> 01:13:34.553
It's simple. but it's clean.
Come here and take my punch.

839
01:13:35.846 --> 01:13:37.348
Oh you want to do a swing

840
01:13:37.348 --> 01:13:38.349
All right. that's cool.

841
01:13:38.432 --> 01:13:41.727
I'm gonna give you a
baseball bat of a leg to the head.

842
01:13:41.727 --> 01:13:46.231
See how well that works.
It's effective. Like this isn't

843
01:13:46.231 --> 01:13:47.316
martial arts.

844
01:13:47.441 --> 01:13:48.609
This is combat.

845
01:13:50.319 --> 01:13:51.695
This is street fighting.

846
01:13:52.905 --> 01:13:53.906
Nice pop.

847
01:13:58.160 --> 01:13:59.662
Ohh..that girl can hit.

848
01:14:00.871 --> 01:14:01.872
Like yea. I can hit.

849
01:14:02.873 --> 01:14:04.500
Now let's get this on.

850
01:14:05.793 --> 01:14:07.252
I run around the world.

851
01:14:08.212 --> 01:14:09.713
Flying country to country

852
01:14:26.313 --> 01:14:29.525
The reason why I'm a little
bit hesitant on this because

853
01:14:29.525 --> 01:14:31.919
you know. even though I don't
care about drama and whatnot.

854
01:14:31.919 --> 01:14:34.713
I do care about butting heads
with other managers that are

855
01:14:35.447 --> 01:14:36.523
running around.

856
01:14:36.523 --> 01:14:38.525
We're kind of working
in the same circles.

857
01:14:38.534 --> 01:14:40.619
You know what I mean.
For this one.

858
01:14:40.619 --> 01:14:45.249
I'm gonna have to
write in twenty percent.

859
01:14:45.416 --> 01:14:48.210
If you can do me a favor if
you can do me one more favor.

860
01:14:48.210 --> 01:14:53.716
then I'll give you your 20
which is I have a well I have

861
01:14:53.716 --> 01:14:54.733
another fighter.

862
01:14:54.733 --> 01:14:59.638
His name is Eric and he's
been on a losing streak and I've

863
01:14:59.638 --> 01:15:01.849
been having a hard
time getting a fight.

864
01:15:02.349 --> 01:15:04.143
I think I do have
some guys that could.

865
01:15:06.311 --> 01:15:08.814
I do think yeah. I think I
got a group that'll that'll work.

866
01:15:10.816 --> 01:15:16.238
Decent crew decent guys.
Pretty much all about business.

867
01:15:16.238 --> 01:15:18.415
All about money just
so everything's on the table.

868
01:15:18.507 --> 01:15:20.300
They're gyopos like you.

869
01:15:21.326 --> 01:15:22.327
They're here.

870
01:15:22.745 --> 01:15:26.832
One of those guys actually
he's got kind of Eric's build.

871
01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:28.533
Now that I'm really
thinking about it.

872
01:15:28.917 --> 01:15:31.044
They do have a similar style.

873
01:15:31.044 --> 01:15:34.590
So then at least the
fight will be entertaining.

874
01:17:15.023 --> 01:17:16.483
We're all in good condition so

875
01:17:17.651 --> 01:17:19.377
I don't think there's
gonna be any problem.

876
01:17:19.411 --> 01:17:20.528
You're smart guy.

877
01:17:20.529 --> 01:17:24.825
Maybe you won't make the
mistake that the other ones make.

878
01:17:26.034 --> 01:17:28.829
What do you mean?
The fight is the easy part.

879
01:17:30.747 --> 01:17:33.333
It's knowing when to cash out
and walk away is the hard part.

880
01:17:34.334 --> 01:17:36.411
But I don't think you're
going to make that mistake.

881
01:17:41.633 --> 01:17:43.367
JAMES: Abel.
Are you okay?

882
01:17:46.305 --> 01:17:47.305
You ready?

883
01:17:49.141 --> 01:17:50.634
Tell me what
you're thinking here.

884
01:17:51.310 --> 01:17:52.519
This is your first fight.

885
01:17:53.437 --> 01:17:54.437
Yes.

886
01:17:55.439 --> 01:17:56.531
What are you thinking?

887
01:17:57.566 --> 01:17:58.567
I don't know.

888
01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:07.242
Remember remember this
this look this feeling Okay. this

889
01:18:07.242 --> 01:18:08.619
is what you need right now.

890
01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:16.919
Right you got this.

891
01:20:15.912 --> 01:20:16.930
Wait. just wait.

892
01:20:42.397 --> 01:20:43.565
Fuck.

893
01:20:50.113 --> 01:20:51.222
Wait. wait. wait.

894
01:20:57.037 --> 01:20:58.038
Don't touch.

895
01:20:58.288 --> 01:21:00.665
We're going to wait until
James comes so wait.

896
01:21:07.255 --> 01:21:09.091
Yes he's my mom so just wait.

897
01:21:09.591 --> 01:21:10.592
James is. whatever

898
01:21:11.718 --> 01:21:12.719
He's running late.

899
01:21:12.969 --> 01:21:15.597
Yes my mom. yes my mom.

900
01:21:17.516 --> 01:21:18.841
You ready?

901
01:21:18.934 --> 01:21:20.018
What?

902
01:21:20.018 --> 01:21:21.311
Man!

903
01:21:21.311 --> 01:21:23.522
He's a man!

904
01:21:23.522 --> 01:21:24.522
I'm a man

905
01:21:24.547 --> 01:21:26.216
Okay just wait for James.

906
01:21:41.915 --> 01:21:43.215
You ready?
You ready to fight.

907
01:21:43.792 --> 01:21:45.335

909
01:23:02.245 --> 01:23:03.321
Hey.

911
01:23:08.210 --> 01:23:09.210
You okay?

912
01:23:13.131 --> 01:23:14.148
Yo.

913
01:23:14.883 --> 01:23:15.967
What happened.

914
01:23:17.135 --> 01:23:18.236
Are you ok?

915
01:23:31.024 --> 01:23:32.024

01:31:34.340 --> 01:31:35.341
What's up.

925
01:31:43.516 --> 01:31:45.601
I think you need to work
on more hooks maybe.

926
01:31:45.727 --> 01:31:47.437
Right hook is very weak buddy.

927
01:31:47.812 --> 01:31:52.316
I think mine is weaker but I'm
kinda developing this new technique

928
01:31:52.316 --> 01:31:55.737
where you know. I can
like lunge and like punch.

929
01:31:56.112 --> 01:32:00.241
So one. like this you know but
you know. we'll see how it works.

930
01:32:00.658 --> 01:32:05.371
Get dressed and let's train! I say
your right hook needs to be worked on!

931
01:32:05.538 --> 01:32:06.622
Okay. let's go.

932
01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:11.627

933
01:32:19.552 --> 01:32:20.762
Hey keep your distance Eric.

01:32:27.643 --> 01:32:29.395
Lighter on your feet.

01:32:29.937 --> 01:32:31.038
Lighter on your feet Eric.

936
01:32:33.441 --> 01:32:35.318
Check it. check it
yea there you go.

937
01:32:36.194 --> 01:32:37.278
Good.

938
01:32:37.987 --> 01:32:38.988
Distance.

939
01:32:44.827 --> 01:32:47.038
Maneuver Get out
of that position.

940
01:32:53.795 --> 01:32:55.713
You're doin good. pace yourself.

941
01:33:01.886 --> 01:33:03.095
This is a sparring match man.

942
01:33:03.346 --> 01:33:04.347
What are you doing.

943
01:33:08.059 --> 01:33:09.260

944
01:33:11.521 --> 01:33:14.899
Hey! At least help
the guy up man.

945
01:33:17.860 --> 01:33:18.869
Are you ok?

946
01:33:20.154 --> 01:33:22.114
It's not a fucking easy
sparring. what the fuck.

947
01:34:25.219 --> 01:34:26.253
Pedro?

948
01:34:26.253 --> 01:34:28.547

01:34:34.437 --> 01:34:35.821
Yeah. I don't know.

952
01:34:59.795 --> 01:35:02.881
Like. almost two
weeks. Two weeks?

953
01:35:03.049 --> 01:35:04.124
Yeah.

954
01:35:26.864 --> 01:35:29.617
Maybe I'm over thinking things.
But I don't know what to do.

955
01:35:32.828 --> 01:35:33.921
You guys fight?

956
01:35:33.946 --> 01:35:35.322
No. we didn't fight.

957
01:35:35.748 --> 01:35:36.840
We didn't fight.

958
01:35:37.041 --> 01:35:40.836
It's just all of a sudden it's
really weird it's really strange.

959
01:35:42.213 --> 01:35:43.230
I will try.

960
01:35:43.714 --> 01:35:44.924
I will try everyday.

961
01:36:32.346 --> 01:36:33.514
Fucking piece of shit.

962
01:36:33.514 --> 01:36:35.433
I know you fucking
back-stabbed us.

963
01:36:35.433 --> 01:36:37.435
All right. I'm gonna
fucking kill you.

964
01:36:37.810 --> 01:36:39.145
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

965
01:36:39.145 --> 01:36:41.212
Do you understand?
I'm gonna fucking

966
01:37:05.629 --> 01:37:07.113
Hey man. How's it going.

967
01:37:07.298 --> 01:37:09.175
No no let's just make
it quick this time.

968
01:37:09.508 --> 01:37:10.576
Alright.

969
01:37:20.519 --> 01:37:22.396
That's all the information
that I have on him.

970
01:37:31.072 --> 01:37:34.658
Alright so by the way I
heard you're in trouble.

971
01:37:35.451 --> 01:37:37.912
If you need some money. you
know I can organize any fight.

972
01:37:40.539 --> 01:37:42.249
I'm not in a position
to fight right now.

973
01:37:42.917 --> 01:37:44.919
Just use your friends money.

974
01:37:46.420 --> 01:37:47.529
What are you talking about?

975
01:37:48.756 --> 01:37:51.008
Your friend that was with
you last time. From Chicago.

976
01:37:51.926 --> 01:37:53.310
He's fighting pretty big fight.

977
01:37:53.344 --> 01:37:54.520
You can use that money.

978
01:37:55.638 --> 01:37:57.739
He's fighting a fight?
X: Did you know?

979
01:37:57.848 --> 01:38:01.644
No I lost touch with him
for about a week and a half.

980
01:38:02.978 --> 01:38:04.004
Oh.

981
01:38:05.439 --> 01:38:06.523
Okay.

982
01:38:07.608 --> 01:38:10.535

fight like where it's taking place in?

the right direction.

the locations and I didn't

JAMES: Eric c'mon.

994
01:45:08.237 --> 01:45:10.531
JAMES: Remember when
we use to ride in the car.

995
01:45:10.531 --> 01:45:13.408
JAMES: You were the only one
that couldn't fit in. you use to jog.

996
01:45:14.910 --> 01:45:16.011
JAMES:You were the only one.

997
01:45:16.328 --> 01:45:18.330
JAMES: You use
to take care of us.

998
01:45:21.542 --> 01:45:23.085

01:45:36.807 --> 01:45:37.808
Give me the knife.

1006
01:45:38.433 --> 01:45:41.299
Don't you remember that.
don't you remember all the good

1007
01:45:41.323 --> 01:45:44.189
times we had when practicing.
That's what it's all about.

1008
01:45:46.233 --> 01:45:47.234
It's all about us.

1009
01:45:47.234 --> 01:45:49.069

1010
01:45:49.945 --> 01:45:51.071
C'mon Eric.

1011
01:45:51.572 --> 01:45:52.573
I need you.

1012
01:45:54.533 --> 01:45:57.619
I need you to be with me. I need
you to stay with me. Just drop the knife.

1013
01:45:59.037 --> 01:46:00.038
RIVAL: Hey hey hey

1014
01:46:01.915 --> 01:46:03.500
Just drop the knife please.

1015
01:46:04.501 --> 01:46:05.577
Abel went home.

1016
01:46:05.602 --> 01:46:06.603
Pedro went home.

1017
01:46:06.628 --> 01:46:07.879
Let's go home.

1018
01:46:10.382 --> 01:46:11.717
Eric. Eric sit down.

1019
01:46:13.552 --> 01:46:14.845
JAMES: Eric sit down please.

1020
01:46:14.845 --> 01:46:15.846
JAMES: Just 5 minutes.

1021
01:46:18.348 --> 01:46:22.108
Eric just drop it. you don't need to
do this! Eric you don't need to do this!

1022
01:46:27.649 --> 01:46:28.733
Come on.

1023
01:47:21.353 --> 01:47:24.247
More than prove something to the
world. share something with the world.

1024
01:47:24.247 --> 01:47:28.001
I feel like I have something
in me. That I have to manifest.

1025
01:47:28.627 --> 01:47:33.006
And once that's manifest then I
feel like that's gonna benefit the world.

1026
01:47:33.507 --> 01:47:34.841
Through my knowledge.

1027
01:47:34.841 --> 01:47:37.928
I can share my learnings from
my journeys around the world.

1028
01:47:37.928 --> 01:47:41.848
So I feel like this
is my duty in my life.

1029
01:47:41.848 --> 01:47:45.435
Like I need to I need to
follow this desire that I have.

1030
01:47:46.019 --> 01:47:48.230
We need a nickname
though James something.

1031
01:47:49.940 --> 01:47:52.567
I'm a champ I'm a champ
I'm a champ!

1032
01:47:52.567 --> 01:47:56.196
What we have in common is like

1033
01:47:56.238 --> 01:48:00.617
we are willing to take
anything to reach our goal.

1034
01:48:00.617 --> 01:48:02.244
I think that's the
fundamental thing.

1035
01:48:02.244 --> 01:48:06.748
And that's what we have.
Everyone in our team have in common.

1036
01:48:08.709 --> 01:48:10.544
Come on. don't run away.

1037
01:48:10.877 --> 01:48:13.088
Oh it hit my balls

1038
01:48:14.131 --> 01:48:15.132
The ball hit my balls.

1039
01:48:27.811 --> 01:48:28.887
The Colosseum?

1040
01:48:29.646 --> 01:48:30.647
What is the Colosseum?

1041
01:48:32.149 --> 01:48:35.235
The Colosseum is where the
toughest fighters in the world

1042
01:48:35.235 --> 01:48:39.531
unite to become
the best in the world.

1043
01:48:40.449 --> 01:48:43.326
And if you don't know
what you're doing.

1044
