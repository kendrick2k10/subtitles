You're gonna have
to put yourself on tape.

101
00:05:19.587 --> 00:05:23.290

Uh...

107
00:05:50.083 --> 00:05:52.453
Is this-- is this for real?

108
00:05:52.586 --> 00:05:55.122
Our video must
really be getting out there.

109
00:05:55.656 --> 00:05:57.958
Wow. I mean. you're really
taking this in stride.

110
00:05:58.125 --> 00:06:00.461
No. I'm-- I'm just
as shocked as you are.

111
00:06:00.628 --> 00:06:03.997
I mean. that's why
it's even more incredible that
our video got to him somehow.

112
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:08.135
Yeah. somehow is right.
I mean. I didn't even know
that guy was still alive.

113
00:06:08.836 --> 00:06:11.138
Maybe he's trying to
turn his life around.

114
00:06:12.005 --> 00:06:13.641
I mean. he always
was a great athlete.

115
00:06:13.774 --> 00:06:16.477
Yeah. well. whatever he used
to be. he's clearly not anymore.

116
00:06:16.644 --> 00:06:18.979
What. he thinks-- he thinks
he can just pop into our lives

117
00:06:19.112 --> 00:06:21.014
after all these years
and jump on our team?

118
00:06:21.148 --> 00:06:24.852
Cammy. everyone deserves
a second chance.

119
00:06:24.985 --> 00:06:27.020
I mean. isn't that
what we're all about?

120
00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.992
I know. I was there.

121
00:06:32.826 --> 00:06:35.028
But everyone deserves
a second chance.

122
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.734
All right.

123
00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:44.171
Okay. All right. yeah. he'll--

124
00:06:45.038 --> 00:06:47.708
he'll get his shot.
but I doubt he'll even show.

125
00:06:48.876 --> 00:06:50.177
Just like last time.

126
00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:55.015
Yo. Toph! On the rings. buddy.

127
00:06:55.148 --> 00:06:56.383
[Andy] Oh. my God.

128
00:06:56.517 --> 00:06:58.519
Oh. we're gonna miss
you guys so much.

129
00:06:58.686 --> 00:07:01.755
Hold on. hold on. hold on.
It's not a eulogy.
guys. all right?

130
00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:03.691
We-- we got seven months.

131
00:07:03.857 --> 00:07:06.660
and if we make the Games...
[sighs]

132
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.197
But I saw the submissions.
Cammy. There's not one snatch
amongst them.

133
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.900
It'll be a challenge. but...

134
00:07:13.033 --> 00:07:15.202
[Zeke] I love you guys so much.

135
00:07:15.368 --> 00:07:17.204
-[both] We know.
-[Zeke] No. but I do.

136
00:07:17.337 --> 00:07:18.872
-I mean. I really do.
-Guys. can we just--

137
00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:21.041
-Let's do the shot.
-Yeah.

138
00:07:21.174 --> 00:07:23.443
-All right. here we go.
-Actually. wait a second.

139
00:07:23.577 --> 00:07:25.345
I have-- I have a little speech.

140
00:07:28.549 --> 00:07:30.183
Did you forget
your speech. Andy?

141
00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:31.752
-I did. I--
-[all laugh]

142
00:07:31.885 --> 00:07:34.387
[Andy] I forgot my speech.
I got it.

143
00:07:35.122 --> 00:07:38.258
Seven years ago. you opened up
The Hollywood Box on a--

144
00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:41.428
on a patch of land in the park.

145
00:07:42.195 --> 00:07:44.632
You slept on the gym floor
to keep it open for us.

146
00:07:44.765 --> 00:07:47.901
You gave me a place to train
for nationals for free.

147
00:07:48.068 --> 00:07:50.203
I never would've placed
at nationals without you.

148
00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:52.205
You-- you guys
made this community

149
00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:55.108
an amazing place
because of your sacrifices.

150
00:07:55.242 --> 00:07:56.877
Oh. that's so beautiful. Andy.

151
00:07:56.977 --> 00:07:58.579
[Andy] All right. I'm not done.

152
00:07:59.446 --> 00:08:01.414
I've thought a lot
about this. guys.

153
00:08:01.549 --> 00:08:05.252
I know I'm not a-- a Metcon guy
or a functional fitness expert.

154
00:08:05.385 --> 00:08:06.920
but I wanna be part of the team.

155
00:08:07.655 --> 00:08:10.791
I wanna bring
whatever I have to offer...

156
00:08:10.924 --> 00:08:12.826
to make this a reality for you.

157
00:08:14.662 --> 00:08:17.264
I just don't wanna see
The Hollywood Box close down.

158
00:08:19.633 --> 00:08:21.301
I don't know what to say. man.

159
00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:24.137
To best friends.

160
00:08:24.271 --> 00:08:25.639
-[Aimee] Yes!
-[Zeke] Damn.

161
00:08:25.773 --> 00:08:26.974
-Salut.
-[Cam] I love you. dude.

162
00:08:27.107 --> 00:08:28.642
[all] Cheers.

163
00:08:28.776 --> 00:08:31.579
-I love you guys.
-Best shot ever.

164
00:08:32.445 --> 00:08:35.015
[Cam] We are losing our gym
in seven months.

165
00:08:35.148 --> 00:08:37.450
Actually. Cammy's just
a little too humble to say it.

166
00:08:37.618 --> 00:08:40.353
but. um. we've been paying
his brother's medical bills

167
00:08:40.487 --> 00:08:43.791
for the past five years.
and that's why we're broke.

168
00:08:43.957 --> 00:08:45.292
Well. I'm not trying
to be humble.

169
00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:47.427
I'm just-- you know.
just not trying to brag.

170
00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:49.663
Well. I know.
but it's for the documentary.

171
00:08:49.797 --> 00:08:51.131
so we have to say it as it is.

172
00:08:51.298 --> 00:08:53.433
You know. I mean.
this is the confessional.

173
00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:54.501
We have to confess.

174
00:08:54.635 --> 00:08:56.103
The light bulb went off.

175
00:08:56.203 --> 00:08:58.606
and we decided that
it was time to make a choice.

176
00:08:58.706 --> 00:09:00.808
Yes. So we're making a movie.

177
00:09:00.974 --> 00:09:03.143
and we are taking
a team to the Games.

178
00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:05.145
You know.
after seven months. we--

179
00:09:05.278 --> 00:09:06.614
we might not have our gym.

180
00:09:06.714 --> 00:09:08.548
but at the very least.

181
00:09:08.682 --> 00:09:11.151
we'll at least-- [chuckles]
At the very least.

182
00:09:11.284 --> 00:09:13.486
At the very least.
we will have done

183
00:09:13.654 --> 00:09:14.988
what we set out to do.

184
00:09:15.689 --> 00:09:16.990
Yeah.

185
00:09:17.858 --> 00:09:19.292
And we'll have each other.

186
00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.063
Well. we will always
have each other.

187
00:09:23.196 --> 00:09:25.165
Oh. good. [chuckles]

188
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.869
Okay. that's gonna
have to be cut out.

189
00:09:29.002 --> 00:09:30.337
[Cam] That's not getting cut.

190
00:09:33.506 --> 00:09:36.009
[Aimee] Hi. I'm Aimee Lansbury.

191
00:09:36.176 --> 00:09:37.845
I just wanted to. um.

192
00:09:37.978 --> 00:09:40.748
take this time
to submit myself for the team.

193
00:09:41.481 --> 00:09:43.350
I've never really
been in any sports.

194
00:09:43.483 --> 00:09:46.553
but I'm the general manager
at the-- The Hollywood Box.

195
00:09:46.687 --> 00:09:50.423
and. uh. I mean. you already
know that. obviously--

196
00:09:51.725 --> 00:09:53.694
[Cam] What's up. man?
Thanks for coming out.

197
00:09:53.861 --> 00:09:56.329
Marcus. what's going on. dude?
You got some new ink?

198
00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:59.399
-[Marcus] Got some new ink. bro.
-[Cam] Good. Lookin' good. girl.

199
00:10:00.367 --> 00:10:02.035
-Heath. right?
-How's it going?

200
00:10:02.202 --> 00:10:04.204
Dude. awesome.
We're so glad to have you here.

201
00:10:04.371 --> 00:10:06.073
-Tiara.
-It's Tara.

202
00:10:06.206 --> 00:10:07.374
-Tara?
-Yeah.

203
00:10:07.507 --> 00:10:09.242
-It's Tara.
-Sorry. Tara.

204
00:10:09.376 --> 00:10:11.211
Thanks for bringing
your girl. dude.

205
00:10:11.344 --> 00:10:12.880
[Romy] Oh. no. big daddy.
I'm trying out.

206
00:10:13.013 --> 00:10:14.447
What-- what about your box?

207
00:10:14.581 --> 00:10:16.616
You're paying.
I'm playing. player.

208
00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:20.587
All right. Ooh. [exclaims]

209
00:10:20.721 --> 00:10:22.222
No. just kidding. Awesome.

210
00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:24.958
Hey. I'm so glad--
You had an awesome interview.

211
00:10:25.092 --> 00:10:29.062
Glad to have with us. man.
Awesome. man.
Well. thank you for coming out.

212
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:33.701
Dude! What are you doing. man?
Come here.

213
00:10:33.801 --> 00:10:35.368
I thought you were punkin' me.

214
00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:37.137
Come on. bro.
You know I got your back.

215
00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:39.372
-Yeah.
-This is where it's going down?

216
00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:42.575
Yeah. this is it.
I feel pretty good about it.

217
00:10:43.076 --> 00:10:45.145
-Let's make it happen.
-All right. man.

218
00:10:46.579 --> 00:10:47.948
Showtime?

219
00:10:50.951 --> 00:10:52.252
He's not coming.

220
00:11:00.894 --> 00:11:02.129
Coming in?

221
00:11:09.937 --> 00:11:12.105
All right. guys.
So in about ten minutes here.

222
00:11:12.272 --> 00:11:14.174
we're gonna put you through
a little workout.

223
00:11:14.307 --> 00:11:16.576
and it's gonna be
a 25-minute time cap.

224
00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:18.779
And if you aren't able to
finish in that amount of time.

225
00:11:18.912 --> 00:11:21.581
unfortunately. you're gonna
be automatically disqualified.

226
00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:23.751
However.
it's important to remember

227
00:11:23.851 --> 00:11:27.620
that we're not just picking
based on your scores.

228
00:11:27.755 --> 00:11:29.622
We're also looking at
who you are.

229
00:11:29.757 --> 00:11:32.259
I don't think there's any better
way to figure out who you are

230
00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:33.660
than to see how you compete.

231
00:11:33.794 --> 00:11:35.996
So let's give it your best shot.

232
00:11:36.129 --> 00:11:39.867
leave it all on the floor. and.
uh. see what you're made of.

233
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.469
[intense music playing]

234
00:11:49.977 --> 00:11:51.478
Nice. nice. Yeah.

235
00:11:51.644 --> 00:11:53.947
Keep winking at me. baby.
I like it.

236
00:11:54.047 --> 00:11:58.551
Jesus. Look at Heath.
Dude's a frickin' beast. man.

237
00:11:58.685 --> 00:12:00.988
-[grunting]
-[Cam] Watch it. buddy.

238
00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:02.689
You're gonna get
somebody hurt. man.

239
00:12:02.823 --> 00:12:05.658
Oh. you're round. man. You're
gonna throw your back out

240
00:12:05.793 --> 00:12:07.828
before you even start.
That a boy.

241
00:12:07.961 --> 00:12:11.664
[Cam] Man. if we can score
Andy and Romy and Tara.

242
00:12:11.832 --> 00:12:13.400
which is huge.
then we're in good shape.

243
00:12:13.533 --> 00:12:15.168
[Laney] I can't believe
Tara's still here.

244
00:12:15.335 --> 00:12:17.670
-[Cam] Two. three. four.
-Stop the count.

245
00:12:17.805 --> 00:12:18.972
All right.

246
00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:22.575
You guys are all
gonna be movie stars!

247
00:12:22.709 --> 00:12:26.213
Here we go. Don't forget
who you are. One minute.

248
00:12:26.346 --> 00:12:28.681
You've got to get that chin
over the bar. Kemp.

249
00:12:28.849 --> 00:12:30.918
-[Kemp grunts]
-Go back. Go back.

250
00:12:31.051 --> 00:12:33.153
Chin over the bar. Get one more.

251
00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:35.989
Go back. Go all the way up.

252
00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:37.757
[grunts]

253
00:12:37.891 --> 00:12:40.327
I love it how
he's the military dude.

254
00:12:40.427 --> 00:12:42.395
and he doesn't even do
a full pull-up.

255
00:12:42.529 --> 00:12:44.697
[Laney] I think he can get
in shape really fast. one.

256
00:12:44.832 --> 00:12:47.500
and two. he would be
amazing for the video.

257
00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.770
[Cam] I think he's already
in pretty good shape.
but he's average all around.

258
00:12:50.904 --> 00:12:53.941
He doesn't specialize
in anything. He's not really
gonna help the team.

259
00:12:54.908 --> 00:12:57.410
[Laney] I just don't think that
we should count him out yet.

260
00:12:57.544 --> 00:12:59.847
That's all I'm saying.
Just keep an open mind about it.

261
00:12:59.947 --> 00:13:04.417
[*]

262
00:13:04.551 --> 00:13:06.386
[grunts]

263
00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:08.121
-You all right?
-Yeah. dude.

264
00:13:11.892 --> 00:13:14.862
All right. guys.
Ten seconds till that cap.

265
00:13:14.962 --> 00:13:16.463
Here we go. Kemp. Here we go.

266
00:13:16.596 --> 00:13:18.231
Five...

267
00:13:18.365 --> 00:13:21.534
-[timer beeping]
-...two. one.

268
00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:23.303
Time.

269
00:13:27.574 --> 00:13:29.376
Yo. your boy pushed me. man.

270
00:13:30.911 --> 00:13:32.779
-Did you push him?
-I didn't see anything.

271
00:13:32.913 --> 00:13:34.481
You can't disqualify
someone for a rumor.

272
00:13:34.614 --> 00:13:36.416
-Did you push him?
-[man] Dude. he pushed me!

273
00:13:36.549 --> 00:13:37.985
You know what. guys?
Great workout.

274
00:13:38.118 --> 00:13:40.587
Um. we'll be back in 30
to announce the selections.

275
00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:45.292
Laney. I think there's something
that. uh. you need to see
in the emails over there.

276
00:13:46.493 --> 00:13:48.428
We can't pay these athletes.

277
00:13:48.561 --> 00:13:50.263
Yeah. no.
we're not paying anyone.

278
00:13:50.397 --> 00:13:51.899
No. I mean. it's. uh.

279
00:13:51.999 --> 00:13:55.235
something about the videos
with. um. all expenses paid.

280
00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:58.438
Uh. excuse me. Did-- did you
just say that you can't pay us?

281
00:13:58.571 --> 00:14:02.275
Okay. apparently there's been
some kind of mix-up about
what we're doing here. but--

282
00:14:02.442 --> 00:14:04.311
-No pay. no play.
-[Laney] No. guys. come on.

283
00:14:04.444 --> 00:14:07.080
If you guys wanna be
a part of a good team.

284
00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.748
come to Pulsar.

285
00:14:09.449 --> 00:14:12.352
-[Cam] Romy. come on. man.
-Fuck off.

286
00:14:13.786 --> 00:14:16.789
Fuck off? [chuckles]
That's cute.

287
00:14:16.924 --> 00:14:20.027
Um. is-- is this because
I'm getting too big for you?

288
00:14:20.928 --> 00:14:23.596
I told you that I wanted to
be a part of Hollywood's team

289
00:14:23.696 --> 00:14:25.966
-for a reason.
-Yeah. no. I get it.

290
00:14:26.133 --> 00:14:27.767
You wanna be a big star.

291
00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:31.471
[laughs]
Have fun with these losers.

292
00:14:31.638 --> 00:14:35.442
And you know what?
Stop freeloading off me. too.

293
00:14:37.044 --> 00:14:39.846
Hey. we didn't--
we didn't want that guy anyways.

294
00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.615
Guys. come on. I promise.
it's gonna be worth it.

295
00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:44.851
-[Laney] Come on.
-[Cam] We need team spirit.

296
00:14:46.019 --> 00:14:48.388
Andy. man.
Come on. we still got this. bud.

297
00:14:48.521 --> 00:14:50.023
Yeah. look. um...

298
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.826
look. I agree
Romy's a douche and all.

299
00:14:53.994 --> 00:14:55.328
but guy's got a point.

300
00:14:55.462 --> 00:14:56.829
-I mean. you guys--
-What?

301
00:14:56.997 --> 00:14:58.531
You never told me this.

302
00:14:58.665 --> 00:15:00.667
I mean. you never--
you never said we--

303
00:15:01.368 --> 00:15:03.003
I'm just--
Bro. I got bills to pay.

304
00:15:03.136 --> 00:15:05.638
We can-- we can throw you
some-- some meals.

305
00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:07.540
and we'll take care
of you as best we can.

306
00:15:07.674 --> 00:15:10.043
We need you for the--
for the team. man. come on.

307
00:15:10.177 --> 00:15:12.379
-We were counting on you.
-I'm out.

308
00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:14.314
Sorry.

309
00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:18.485
[somber music playing]

310
00:15:22.855 --> 00:15:24.157
[Cam sighs]

311
00:15:25.025 --> 00:15:27.694
Well. I-- I guess we should
just tell 'em to go home.

312
00:15:30.397 --> 00:15:31.698
Right?

313
00:15:33.066 --> 00:15:34.401
Did Frederica give up?

314
00:15:35.168 --> 00:15:36.703
-Oh. geez.
-What?

315
00:15:36.836 --> 00:15:38.505
I feel like we can
learn a lot from that duck.

316
00:15:38.605 --> 00:15:40.873
What. about how not to fly?

317
00:15:41.041 --> 00:15:42.209
No.

318
00:15:42.342 --> 00:15:44.877
About persistence
and resilience.

319
00:15:45.012 --> 00:15:49.582
I-- I can't believe
that we're talking about
Fred the Duck right now.

320
00:15:49.716 --> 00:15:51.218
[Laney] Frederica.
She was a girl.

321
00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:53.853
Yeah. well. she was
pretty clumsy for being a girl.

322
00:15:53.953 --> 00:15:56.623
No. she was tenacious.
like her owner.

323
00:15:56.756 --> 00:15:59.526
She waddled all the way
after us after we dropped her
off at that lake.

324
00:15:59.626 --> 00:16:02.795
-She only waddled because
she didn't know how to fly.
-But she learned to.

325
00:16:02.929 --> 00:16:06.566
Yeah. after we dropped her
off a hill 476 times.

326
00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:08.735
Are you guys
talking about ducks?

327
00:16:10.403 --> 00:16:12.072
They're talking about ducks.

328
00:16:12.239 --> 00:16:15.575
[Cam] These guys know nothing
about functional fitness.
nothing.

329
00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:20.413
Look. when we graduated
from college.

330
00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.482
we had a choice. right?

331
00:16:22.615 --> 00:16:24.084
I mean. you could've
become your brother.

332
00:16:24.217 --> 00:16:27.554
You could've entered the draft
and made the NFL.

333
00:16:28.488 --> 00:16:29.822
But you didn't.

334
00:16:29.956 --> 00:16:32.392
It would've made your dad happy.
but not you.

335
00:16:33.426 --> 00:16:37.430
This is the challenge that your
whole life has prepared you for.

336
00:16:37.597 --> 00:16:40.167
I mean. this is everything
that we were asking for.

337
00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.002
We've got raw material there.

338
00:16:43.136 --> 00:16:44.971
Like. really raw.

339
00:16:45.105 --> 00:16:48.341
But you can mold them
and you can work with them.

340
00:16:48.475 --> 00:16:50.110
I know you can.

341
00:16:52.312 --> 00:16:55.782
This is your chance to be
the leader that I know you are.

342
00:16:58.985 --> 00:17:01.588
[Cam] All right. Thank you guys
so much for sticking around.

343
00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:03.123
This should only
take a couple of minutes.

344
00:17:03.256 --> 00:17:04.757
[Laney] Actually. it might
take a little bit longer.

345
00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:06.826
I gotta get
a quick picture for Instagram.

346
00:17:09.196 --> 00:17:12.432
Take it. I need to get
a promotional photo

347
00:17:12.532 --> 00:17:13.966
of the selected team.
and I need you in it.

348
00:17:14.134 --> 00:17:16.669
Hey. it's. uh.
nice to see you. Laner.

349
00:17:17.804 --> 00:17:19.339
I don't go by
that nickname anymore.

350
00:17:19.472 --> 00:17:20.807
Well. you don't
choose your nickname.

351
00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:22.642
Either way.
I need you to take the shirt.

352
00:17:22.809 --> 00:17:24.644
-No. I didn't come here--
-Okay. fine.

353
00:17:24.811 --> 00:17:26.513
-Step aside.
-No. babe. I-- I got it.

354
00:17:26.646 --> 00:17:28.281
Here we go.

355
00:17:29.015 --> 00:17:33.520
Seems like your team spirit
is the same as it ever was. huh?

356
00:17:33.653 --> 00:17:35.322
Well. I just wanted you
to look pretty.

357
00:17:35.488 --> 00:17:36.656
-[Cam chuckles]
-Look at that.

358
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:39.392
-Thank you.
-Fits those big guns.

359
00:17:39.526 --> 00:17:40.827
Big guns.

360
00:17:40.993 --> 00:17:42.495
Didn't know we were
the same size.

361
00:17:42.662 --> 00:17:44.197
Well. you know. I figured--

362
00:17:44.331 --> 00:17:47.033
figured it might be good
to have a contingency plan.

363
00:17:47.167 --> 00:17:51.538
So. uh. all right. let's move
it in. Here. come on. get in.

364
00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:53.840
[Laney] Feet up. There we go.

365
00:17:54.006 --> 00:17:55.508
[Cam] Every team
always needs a black sheep.

366
00:17:55.675 --> 00:17:57.144
-Oh.
-[all chuckle]

367
00:17:57.244 --> 00:17:59.179
Get it on. guys. Flex.

368
00:17:59.312 --> 00:18:01.348
Oh. you're naughty. Cam.

369
00:18:01.481 --> 00:18:03.015
["Who You Are"
by Lost City playing]

370
00:18:03.183 --> 00:18:07.019
* Oh. how the years
Have crippled my love *

371
00:18:07.154 --> 00:18:10.757
* Down deep beneath
The surface *

372
00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:13.860

00:18:13.993 --> 00:18:16.163
* Feel things

* When we were young
That's what they told you *

375
00:18:25.405 --> 00:18:28.040
* But it's so hard

376
00:18:28.175 --> 00:18:33.713
* To find who you are now... *

377
00:18:33.846 --> 00:18:35.848
-[Cam] All right. let's do it.
-All right.

378
00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:37.284
So. you're a Jersey girl. huh?

379
00:18:37.417 --> 00:18:38.751
Yeah. Jersey girl.

380
00:18:38.885 --> 00:18:40.787
Went to Penn State.
What about you guys?

381
00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.789
-[both] Georgia.
-[laughing]

382
00:18:42.922 --> 00:18:44.791
-Bulldogs.
-Bulldogs. Nice. Nice.

383
00:18:44.924 --> 00:18:47.260
-[Hillary chuckles]
-Oh. that is Big Jim.

384
00:18:47.394 --> 00:18:50.697
-He's our local security guard.
-And awesome roommate.

385
00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:53.132
Anyway. we normally
go in the back here.

386
00:18:53.266 --> 00:18:54.734
[dog barking]

387
00:18:54.901 --> 00:18:56.803
Don't be surprised if he gets
a little cuddly at night.

388
00:18:56.936 --> 00:18:58.771
All right. he's just--
just there to keep you warm.

389
00:18:58.905 --> 00:19:02.609
No. it's fine.
Thank you guys so much
for letting me crash with you.

390
00:19:02.742 --> 00:19:04.577
-Of course.
-It's super generous.

391
00:19:04.711 --> 00:19:06.913
Yes. sugar.
We got to do whatever
we can do to keep you around.

392
00:19:07.046 --> 00:19:10.250
Yeah. you would think with
all of your achievements
in judo. it would pay better.

393
00:19:10.383 --> 00:19:12.285
Yeah. I mean. I wish.

394
00:19:12.419 --> 00:19:13.986
but unfortunately.

395
00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.822
you're kind of
on your own for that. so.

396
00:19:15.955 --> 00:19:17.224
Well. you have us
as your family now.

397
00:19:17.324 --> 00:19:19.926
so I think this is
a group hug opportunity.

398
00:19:20.092 --> 00:19:22.462
He is so gross. Don't let him
flirt with you like this.

399
00:19:22.595 --> 00:19:23.963
[laughs] It's fine. I just--

400
00:19:24.096 --> 00:19:25.965
I hope I don't get
into your guys' hair.

401
00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:28.100
No. you can get
all up in our hair.

402
00:19:28.235 --> 00:19:31.170
We need some of that mojo
to rub off on us.
Got a winner in the house.

403
00:19:31.304 --> 00:19:34.941
You can set yourself up in here.
I know it's not ideal.
but it's what we got. so.

404
00:19:35.107 --> 00:19:37.277
-It's perfect.
-Okay. well.
make yourself at home.

405
00:19:37.444 --> 00:19:40.747
and why don't you come help me
get some stuff out of the car?

406
00:19:42.114 --> 00:19:43.983
Oh. remember
when you were in the--

407
00:19:44.116 --> 00:19:45.985
when you were in the annex
at lunch earlier?

408
00:19:46.118 --> 00:19:49.021
-Andre wanted to have
another little chat.
-Oh. boy.

409
00:19:49.155 --> 00:19:50.957
Yeah. and you know how
he looks through everything

410
00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:52.792
with the lens
of Eastern mythology.

411
00:19:52.959 --> 00:19:55.495
Yeah. well. his fitness
is a myth. that's for sure.

412
00:19:55.628 --> 00:19:57.330
Well. now that
he's started coaching.

413
00:19:57.464 --> 00:20:00.199
he says he doesn't have
enough time to train anymore.

414
00:20:00.333 --> 00:20:01.934
I can't believe
that guy's a coach.

415
00:20:02.034 --> 00:20:04.271
[snickers] It's so ridiculous.

416
00:20:04.371 --> 00:20:05.838
Well. you hired him.

417
00:20:05.972 --> 00:20:07.974
Yeah. well. that's because
we needed cheap help.

418
00:20:08.808 --> 00:20:12.812
Anyway. his point was that
he's had some kind of
spiritual realization

419
00:20:12.979 --> 00:20:16.148
that he was in the worst shape
of his life a year ago.
and now he's in the best.

420
00:20:16.316 --> 00:20:18.851
and he could continue
getting in better shape.
but what's the point?

421
00:20:18.985 --> 00:20:21.120
-Because that story is over.
-I don't understand

422
00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.790
how Andre even knew
his story started. Laney.

423
00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:26.058
I don't know. but he says
that now all those hours

424
00:20:26.192 --> 00:20:29.195
are going back into
giving to people.

425
00:20:29.996 --> 00:20:31.498
So what are you saying?

426
00:20:31.664 --> 00:20:33.966
He's gonna quit coaching?
I've got to find a replacement?

427
00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:36.669
No. Cammy.
he's quitting training.

428
00:20:36.803 --> 00:20:38.805
That's the end of that story.

429
00:20:40.006 --> 00:20:41.173
Do you not want me to compete?

430
00:20:41.308 --> 00:20:43.142
No. this has nothing
to do with that.

431
00:20:43.242 --> 00:20:45.845
Okay. Because if
anybody's gonna suffer.

432
00:20:46.012 --> 00:20:48.648
it's gonna be me. all right?
And they need me. baby.

433
00:20:48.748 --> 00:20:50.583
We've got a bunch
of inexperienced athletes.

434
00:20:50.717 --> 00:20:52.385
and we're trying to
get to the Games.

435
00:20:52.519 --> 00:20:54.854
Can you trust me on this?

436
00:20:56.823 --> 00:20:58.591
I know they need you.

437
00:20:58.725 --> 00:21:00.560
-And I trust you.
-Good.

438
00:21:00.693 --> 00:21:02.028
And this isn't
gonna go as planned.

439
00:21:02.161 --> 00:21:05.264
so I'm just gonna
think outside of the box.

440
00:21:06.366 --> 00:21:07.767
[chuckles] Come here.

441
00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.437
Oh. God. That was disgusting.

442
00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:12.439
[laughs]

443
00:21:12.572 --> 00:21:14.206
Did he just join the team?

444
00:21:14.374 --> 00:21:17.377
Yeah. that's not a conflict
of interest or anything.

445
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:19.912
I wonder which one
of the four he'll pick.

446
00:21:20.046 --> 00:21:22.048
[Amari] So. guys. Topher's
letting me stay with him.

447
00:21:22.214 --> 00:21:25.718
-I only did this
because I'm a team player.
-Team. my ass.

448
00:21:25.885 --> 00:21:30.056
So. I gave them all mini cameras
so they can film
their own confessionals.

449
00:21:30.189 --> 00:21:32.124
Ah. Here.

450
00:21:32.258 --> 00:21:33.760
Here. here at last.

451
00:21:33.893 --> 00:21:35.294
They're in black and white.

452
00:21:35.428 --> 00:21:37.063
I know. it's artsy. ehh.

453
00:21:37.196 --> 00:21:38.931
but I think it could
be really beautiful.

454
00:21:39.065 --> 00:21:41.401
We're gonna turn these around
and then see later.

455
00:21:41.568 --> 00:21:42.902
[Laney] Cam won't see them.

456
00:21:43.069 --> 00:21:44.904
so they can air
their grievances and whatever.

457
00:21:45.071 --> 00:21:46.272
Cam seems really nice.

458
00:21:46.406 --> 00:21:48.875
I bet his workouts
will be real functional.

459
00:21:48.975 --> 00:21:51.744
Talking about Cam
and stuff like that.

460
00:21:53.413 --> 00:21:56.248
I can't even speak.
That's how excited I am.
[laughs]

461
00:21:56.416 --> 00:21:59.318
They're literally letting me
stay in their home.

462
00:21:59.452 --> 00:22:03.823
I'm a little worried about
Cam joining the team. [sighs]

463
00:22:03.956 --> 00:22:06.058
Thank you. Laney. [chuckles]

464
00:22:06.158 --> 00:22:10.162
I'm just worried
he's gonna overextend himself.

465
00:22:10.296 --> 00:22:11.564
[Cam] Oh. man.

466
00:22:11.664 --> 00:22:13.600
Sometimes when I do this.
I feel like I'm gonna fart.

467
00:22:13.766 --> 00:22:15.435
[Hillary laughs]

468
00:22:15.568 --> 00:22:17.136
Oh. God. I know. I know.

469
00:22:17.269 --> 00:22:19.338
We just do the same thing
over and over.

470
00:22:19.472 --> 00:22:23.443
[laughs] It's okay.
We get to watch TV.

471
00:22:23.576 --> 00:22:26.413
[Cam sighs] Isn't it funny?
Like. do you ever think about

472
00:22:26.513 --> 00:22:29.749
how much time we voluntarily
spend in pain?

473
00:22:29.849 --> 00:22:32.084
Well. I certainly
don't feel it anymore.

474
00:22:32.184 --> 00:22:33.285
Oh. I do.

475
00:22:34.086 --> 00:22:35.788
-Ow. Stop it.
-[Hillary chuckles]

476
00:22:35.922 --> 00:22:37.189
What are you doing? Quit that.

477
00:22:37.323 --> 00:22:39.792
I don't want you
to feel any pain anymore.

478
00:22:39.959 --> 00:22:41.594
-Right.
-I'm gonna toughen you up.

479
00:22:41.694 --> 00:22:43.530
Oh.

480
00:22:43.663 --> 00:22:45.131
[camera beeps]

481
00:22:47.266 --> 00:22:49.035
[sighs]

482
00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:52.472
Well...

483
00:22:54.974 --> 00:22:58.511
I've always dedicated
my success to Jack.

484
00:22:58.645 --> 00:23:00.480
[somber music playing]

485
00:23:01.948 --> 00:23:04.884
Yeah. Jack played
football like a--

486
00:23:06.653 --> 00:23:09.221
He played like a guy
from the newspaper era.

487
00:23:10.957 --> 00:23:13.826
He fired up
the imagination so high

488
00:23:13.993 --> 00:23:16.328
that you could
only write about him.

489
00:23:16.463 --> 00:23:19.031
because video surely
wouldn't do him justice.

490
00:23:20.967 --> 00:23:24.303
He deserved tall tales.

491
00:23:26.005 --> 00:23:27.339
Breathless campfire legends

492
00:23:27.507 --> 00:23:29.842
that old men
pass on to their sons.

493
00:23:31.911 --> 00:23:33.212
He was...

494
00:23:35.347 --> 00:23:36.483
pure.

495
00:23:40.152 --> 00:23:41.888
He didn't belong in this era.

496
00:23:45.992 --> 00:23:47.894
Uh... [grunts]

497
00:23:48.027 --> 00:23:51.263
So. I'm-- I'm just--

498
00:23:51.397 --> 00:23:52.999
I'm not trying
to replace him or anything.

499
00:23:53.099 --> 00:23:54.433
I'm trying to honor him.

500
00:23:55.935 --> 00:23:59.672
Because I didn't really wanna
join the team as an athlete.

501
00:23:59.772 --> 00:24:01.373
You know.
I just wanted to coach the guys.

502
00:24:01.541 --> 00:24:04.110
so anything.
it's-- it's a sacrifice.

503
00:24:07.514 --> 00:24:10.249
So... [sighs]

504
00:24:12.785 --> 00:24:14.053
No.

505
00:24:16.222 --> 00:24:17.890
I would definitely not say

506
00:24:18.024 --> 00:24:20.059

to be my brother.

I think I'm gonna actually
switch up the workout. guys.

522
00:25:00.066 --> 00:25:03.002

and keep my eye on it.

I know we're not prepped for it.

524

and do one rep max cleans

00:25:08.274 --> 00:25:11.844
and establish
our baselines today. okay?

to get him on board.

wanna be. [sighs]

528

Well. talk to him. find a way.

It's not that--
it's not that simple. Laney.

530
00:25:24.857 --> 00:25:26.258
[Laney] I think it could be.

531
00:25:26.358 --> 00:25:28.628
I think you just need
to say something to him

532
00:25:28.761 --> 00:25:29.862
that makes him feel welcome.

533
00:25:29.996 --> 00:25:32.431
We're not-- we're not dating.

534
00:25:32.531 --> 00:25:34.634
Okay. if he-- if he wants
to be a part of the team.

535
00:25:34.767 --> 00:25:36.302
then he can participate.

536
00:25:37.103 --> 00:25:38.370
[Laney]
Maybe make him feel welcome

537
00:25:38.504 --> 00:25:40.306
and he will participate.
that's all I'm saying.

538
00:25:40.439 --> 00:25:42.875
No. I shouldn't
have to go to him.

539
00:25:43.009 --> 00:25:44.644
I shouldn't have to talk to him.

540
00:25:47.513 --> 00:25:48.881
[Kemp] Thanks.

541
00:25:52.151 --> 00:25:54.687
Well. thanks for coming
to grab a drink with me.

yourself in pretty good shape.

You're picking me for the team.

Nah. Fuck football.

to the park and--

haven't popped out a kid yet?

00:33:03.615 --> 00:33:05.251
Am I worried?

673
00:33:06.052 --> 00:33:07.453
["Take 2 Or 3"
by Tim Blane playing]

674
00:33:07.586 --> 00:33:09.288
Am I worried?

675
00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:12.458
That's all I am today.

676
00:33:14.926 --> 00:33:16.095
[coughs]

677
00:33:26.505 --> 00:33:28.807
-What's up?
-Hey.

678
00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:30.642
Yo. Cam.

679
00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:33.512
What's with this programming.
man? You trying to kill us?

680
00:33:33.645 --> 00:33:37.616
Come on. Morris.
You know you love those
beach muscle workouts. baby.

681
00:33:37.749 --> 00:33:40.286
Yeah. I think that was
for your other team.

682
00:33:41.187 --> 00:33:44.423
Oh. man. did I-- did
I switch up the programming?

683
00:33:44.523 --> 00:33:46.792
It's cool. Careful. man.

684
00:33:46.925 --> 00:33:48.327
If you stop appreciating us.

685
00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:50.362
we'll just take our stuff
over to Pulsar.

686
00:33:52.798 --> 00:33:54.133
[Laney] Bill. [chuckles]

687
00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.135
Could you do take care
of these for me. Aimee?

688
00:33:56.268 --> 00:33:58.837
Oh. Aimee. I got those.

689
00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:00.506
I think Laney needs
your help more.

690
00:34:00.639 --> 00:34:01.807
so I'll take care of it.

691
00:34:01.973 --> 00:34:03.975
-Thank you.
-[phone ringing]

692
00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:05.511
Hey. Rory.

693
00:34:08.647 --> 00:34:10.949
Hey. Ames. can you-- uh.
can you e-mail the members

694
00:34:11.049 --> 00:34:13.352
and let them know that
we're gonna open up gym hours

695
00:34:13.485 --> 00:34:14.653
during the day this week?

696
00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:17.489
Yeah. isn't that
when the team trains?

697
00:34:17.623 --> 00:34:20.459
Yeah. well.
we're gonna switch it up. so.

698
00:34:21.993 --> 00:34:23.495
Thank you.

699
00:34:25.831 --> 00:34:27.499
Yo. team.
come check it out. guys.

700
00:34:27.666 --> 00:34:29.635
[Laney]
Zeke is such a sweetheart.

701
00:34:29.735 --> 00:34:31.537
I can't believe
he told you about the team.

702
00:34:32.338 --> 00:34:35.040
Oh. you were impressed
by the submissions video?

703
00:34:35.174 --> 00:34:36.808
Thanks.

704
00:34:36.908 --> 00:34:39.478
Uh. yeah. no.
it's looking great.

705
00:34:39.578 --> 00:34:40.979
Uh. the--

706
00:34:41.079 --> 00:34:44.516
Oh. yeah. the athletes
are looking. um. great.

707
00:34:46.084 --> 00:34:48.019
This afternoon?

708
00:34:48.154 --> 00:34:49.155
No. no. no. no. no.

709
00:34:49.255 --> 00:34:51.423
Uh. if you want to meet me.

710
00:34:51.557 --> 00:34:53.359
we'll make it work.

711
00:34:53.492 --> 00:34:54.860
Okay. yeah. great.

712
00:34:55.026 --> 00:34:56.428
Uh. see you soon.

713
00:34:56.562 --> 00:34:57.829
Bye.

714
00:34:57.929 --> 00:35:01.032
[Kemp] Smart move. Laner.
Not FaceTiming.

715
00:35:01.833 --> 00:35:03.902
They would've seen
your tell for sure.

716
00:35:05.371 --> 00:35:06.838
Someone's jumpy.

717
00:35:06.938 --> 00:35:09.040
When you startle someone.
they jump.

718
00:35:09.175 --> 00:35:12.077
When you hide someone.
their presence is startling.

719
00:35:12.211 --> 00:35:13.512
Shh.

720
00:35:15.881 --> 00:35:17.883
-What is it?
-There.

721
00:35:18.884 --> 00:35:19.918
What?

722
00:35:21.587 --> 00:35:24.790
When you get nervous. you switch
the phone to your right hand.

723
00:35:24.923 --> 00:35:25.857
And shake.

724
00:35:25.957 --> 00:35:28.727
Something about switching lanes.

725
00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:31.197
trying to control
your artistic side.

726
00:35:32.898 --> 00:35:34.633
You can't just
walk back into my life

727
00:35:34.766 --> 00:35:36.802
after all these years
and pretend that you know me.

728
00:35:36.935 --> 00:35:39.438
Well. I didn't just
walk back into your life.

729
00:35:40.272 --> 00:35:41.573
You invited me.

730
00:35:43.809 --> 00:35:45.577
Why'd you invite me. Lane?

731
00:35:47.879 --> 00:35:49.781
Why didn't you say goodbye?

732
00:35:54.253 --> 00:35:56.422
[distant chatter]

733
00:35:56.588 --> 00:35:58.924
-I did not invite you.
-Fine.

734
00:35:59.925 --> 00:36:00.992
For you.

735
00:36:02.093 --> 00:36:03.229
For now.

736
00:36:07.633 --> 00:36:09.235
All righty. guys.
we'll meet at the park

737
00:36:09.335 --> 00:36:10.469
at 3:00 p.m.. all right?

738
00:36:10.602 --> 00:36:13.104
-All right.
-All righty. see ya.

739
00:36:13.272 --> 00:36:14.240
-Go eat.
-Hi. Coach.

740
00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:15.441
[Cam] Hydrate later.

741
00:36:15.574 --> 00:36:16.942
Where is everyone going?

742
00:36:17.843 --> 00:36:19.945
Well. I'm just throwing
a little wrench in their gears

743
00:36:20.111 --> 00:36:21.780
with a five-day
Nature Workout Challenge.

744
00:36:21.913 --> 00:36:24.149
-A Nature Workout Challenge?
-That's right.

745
00:36:24.283 --> 00:36:26.285
You got functional fitness.
gotta be prepared for

746
00:36:26.418 --> 00:36:27.653
the unknown and the unknowable.

747
00:36:27.786 --> 00:36:28.987
Do I really have time for

748
00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:31.189
a functional
fitness maxim right now?

749
00:36:31.323 --> 00:36:33.959
What. is there
something wrong with right now?

750
00:36:34.092 --> 00:36:37.629
No. it's just--
I got a call from Rory.

751
00:36:37.763 --> 00:36:40.131
He's a pretty big producer.
you know?

752
00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:43.435
Which one's the producer again?

753
00:36:43.535 --> 00:36:45.637
Anyway. we heard about the team

754
00:36:45.771 --> 00:36:47.639
and he wants to take
a meeting with us.

755
00:36:47.773 --> 00:36:49.040
About a deal.

756
00:36:49.174 --> 00:36:50.876
Well. you seem
kind of tense about it.

757
00:36:51.009 --> 00:36:53.812
Yeah. I am.
This is a big meeting for us.

758
00:36:53.945 --> 00:36:56.548
-I'm going?
-Of course. This afternoon.

759
00:36:56.682 --> 00:36:58.517
Well. no. hon.
I can't go this afternoon.

760
00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:01.320
-I gotta take the team out.
-No. I need you to come with me.

761
00:37:01.487 --> 00:37:04.856
Plus. I need them
getting more footage anyway.
I mean. what were you thinking?

762
00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:08.894
Well. that's exactly what I was
thinking about. We're gonna be
out in nature. you know?

763
00:37:09.027 --> 00:37:10.829
Spectacular visuals.
swinging off vines.

764
00:37:10.962 --> 00:37:12.364
jumping creeks.
tossing boulders.

765
00:37:12.498 --> 00:37:13.532
What is this. Tarzan?

766
00:37:13.665 --> 00:37:15.233
No. this is nature.

767
00:37:16.034 --> 00:37:17.336
I-- I did this for you.

768
00:37:18.136 --> 00:37:23.342
I see. And. um. how are you
planning on videoing out there?

769
00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:25.344
Hmm.

770
00:37:26.512 --> 00:37:30.549
Maybe-- maybe Rory has
some extra GoPros I can borrow.

771
00:37:32.418 --> 00:37:34.052
I guess I'm coming
to this meeting with you.

772
00:37:34.185 --> 00:37:36.655
And maybe in the future
you'll consult me

773
00:37:36.755 --> 00:37:38.824
before you make
any more decisions?

774
00:37:40.158 --> 00:37:43.061
[laughs] Wait.
so no one can see you?

775
00:37:43.194 --> 00:37:45.497
We don't care
if anybody sees us.

776
00:37:46.231 --> 00:37:48.534
Do you know
how sexy you guys are?

777
00:37:48.667 --> 00:37:51.002
You are so sexy that we can
get you a deal for the show.

778
00:37:51.102 --> 00:37:55.073
-Nice.
-It's not actually a show.

779
00:37:55.206 --> 00:37:58.209
Yeah. it is now. See.
I talked with a friend at ESPN.

780
00:37:58.344 --> 00:37:59.911
and. you know.
functional fitness is hot.

781
00:38:00.045 --> 00:38:01.713
They own the Games.
It makes sense now.

782
00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.215
You're at the right time.
You're at the right place.

783
00:38:04.383 --> 00:38:06.718
Nothing to do with you guys.
No offense.

784
00:38:06.852 --> 00:38:08.354
-[Cam] None taken.
-Okay.

785
00:38:08.454 --> 00:38:11.089
And I guess it could be
reconceived as a show.

786
00:38:11.222 --> 00:38:13.892
Oh. don't be
so artsy-fartsy. Lane.

787
00:38:14.059 --> 00:38:16.362
-So-- so they made an offer?
-[Rory] Well. no.

788
00:38:16.462 --> 00:38:18.196
-No. they didn't make an offer.
-I'm sorry.

789
00:38:18.296 --> 00:38:20.432
-I don't think I follow.
-This is an opportunity.

790
00:38:20.566 --> 00:38:22.701
You shoot this thing
on spec with your own dollar.

791
00:38:22.801 --> 00:38:25.571
You follow the team
for the season. you make
the Games. you make the Games.

792
00:38:25.737 --> 00:38:29.240
and I have a friend at ESPN
who's really keen on
making this a reality show.

793
00:38:29.408 --> 00:38:30.742
A reality show?

794
00:38:30.909 --> 00:38:32.744
-And only if we make the Games.
-[Zeke] Yeah.

795
00:38:32.911 --> 00:38:35.881
Who wants to watch a bunch
of random functional fitness
people anyway?

796
00:38:35.981 --> 00:38:38.083
Yeah. right? Zeke's right.
I mean. you win the Games.

797
00:38:38.249 --> 00:38:40.318
we get something to talk about.
You don't. what do we have?

798
00:38:40.452 --> 00:38:42.954
We have a bunch of hot
white people having sex.
Give me the CW. you know?

799
00:38:43.088 --> 00:38:45.891
-[Zeke] Or porn.
-Or porn.

800
00:38:46.758 --> 00:38:49.728
S-- Yeah. Well?

801
00:38:49.828 --> 00:38:52.263
-[both laughing]
-So we have a deal?

802
00:38:53.432 --> 00:38:54.500
Quick question.

803
00:38:55.434 --> 00:38:58.003
You guys happen to have
any GoPros you could loan us?

804
00:39:03.442 --> 00:39:04.743
It's 3:00 p.m.

805
00:39:04.843 --> 00:39:06.177
We're here.

806
00:39:06.311 --> 00:39:07.779
Where's Coach?

807
00:39:12.651 --> 00:39:14.352
[Cam] GoPros!

808
00:39:14.486 --> 00:39:16.422
Courtesy of ESPN. Why?

809
00:39:16.522 --> 00:39:19.791
Because they like the concept.
but not necessarily the cast.

810
00:39:19.925 --> 00:39:21.493
They wanna see
you guys in motion.

811
00:39:21.627 --> 00:39:23.762
If you're trying to threaten us.
the first thing they'll replace

812
00:39:23.862 --> 00:39:26.798
is the captain when
they figure out how dangerous
this programming is.

813
00:39:26.965 --> 00:39:28.634
What are we gonna do?
Handstands off a cliff?

814
00:39:28.767 --> 00:39:30.001
Five workouts.

815
00:39:30.135 --> 00:39:31.637
Win. and you guys
are granted immunity.

816
00:39:31.803 --> 00:39:34.139
Wow. We're playing Survivor.

817
00:39:34.272 --> 00:39:36.307
Come in last.
and you might get cut.

818
00:39:36.475 --> 00:39:39.811
Teammates are:
B-Man Heath and Tara.

819
00:39:39.978 --> 00:39:44.282
Topher and Amari.
Hillsbills and Kempers.

820
00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:47.152
All right. let's do it. guys.
Here we go.

821
00:39:50.321 --> 00:39:52.390
[Hillary]
It's actually kind of spooky.

822
00:39:53.825 --> 00:39:56.127
Sorry. I'm too busy training.

823
00:39:57.463 --> 00:40:02.000
Unbelievable. He sends us to
a tourist trap to do a workout.

824
00:40:02.167 --> 00:40:05.904
Because maybe they wanna see
the lead-up to the event.

825
00:40:06.037 --> 00:40:08.306
I'm sure they wanna
see the event. too.

826
00:40:08.406 --> 00:40:09.841
Wait. I'm sorry.

827
00:40:10.008 --> 00:40:11.743
You're not gonna
turn the GoPro on at all?

828
00:40:11.877 --> 00:40:14.580
-It's required.
-I don't think it is.

829
00:40:15.481 --> 00:40:17.483
I'm glad to know
I can count on you.

830
00:40:17.583 --> 00:40:21.352
[rock music playing]

831
00:40:23.722 --> 00:40:25.056
Yes!

832
00:40:26.692 --> 00:40:28.527
You're done.

833
00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:30.028
[Hillary] Oh. Kemp.

834
00:40:30.161 --> 00:40:32.030
Wanna have a conversation
about Kemp?

835
00:40:32.163 --> 00:40:33.999
He sucks.
He doesn't do anything.

836
00:40:34.099 --> 00:40:37.503
No. actually. he does.
He just sucks at it.

837
00:40:37.603 --> 00:40:40.071
You're gonna need
your hands on this one.

838
00:40:40.872 --> 00:40:42.508
Opposable thumbs.

839
00:40:42.608 --> 00:40:46.411
[*]

840
00:40:46.545 --> 00:40:48.714
After two days
of nature workouts.

841
00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:52.017
we have all gotten
beautiful tans.

842
00:40:52.117 --> 00:40:56.555
We got sandbag carries
up the hill to tree climb.

843
00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:00.792
Nice. Go. go. go. go. go.

844
00:41:02.293 --> 00:41:05.764
Seriously. Laney. you need
to take control of your team.

845
00:41:05.897 --> 00:41:07.699
You need to fire Kemp.

846
00:41:07.799 --> 00:41:12.904
[*]

847
00:41:20.812 --> 00:41:22.247
Come on. dude.

848
00:41:24.983 --> 00:41:26.618
-Great work.
-Great workout.

849
00:41:26.752 --> 00:41:29.387
Yeah. it would be a fantastic
workout if you did it right.

850
00:41:29.487 --> 00:41:31.089
[Hillary] No wonder
you got discharged.

851
00:41:31.222 --> 00:41:32.490
Hey. you don't know
anything about that.

852
00:41:32.624 --> 00:41:34.626
I don't need to know
anything about that.

853
00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:37.563
All I need you to realize
is that you're on my team.

854
00:41:37.663 --> 00:41:39.097
Act like it!

855
00:41:40.431 --> 00:41:43.101
[Cam] He's got to go.
He's got to go.

856
00:41:43.735 --> 00:41:46.271
I'm gonna have to pull
the trigger on this one.

857
00:41:50.141 --> 00:41:52.477
It's our final workout.
so we got Laney here

858
00:41:52.611 --> 00:41:54.946
to watch and capture video.

859
00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:58.449
I'm gonna jump in with you guys
for this one. so if I beat any--

860
00:41:58.617 --> 00:41:59.851
-What?
-[Cam] What?

861
00:41:59.985 --> 00:42:02.020
Are you a coach
or are you a competitor?

862
00:42:02.153 --> 00:42:03.622
Uh. I'm a player coach.

863
00:42:03.789 --> 00:42:05.290
I thought
we had established that.

864
00:42:05.456 --> 00:42:07.525
-Pick a side.
-Wow. Okay.

865
00:42:07.659 --> 00:42:10.696
So I know that we paced it out
on some of our workouts

866
00:42:10.829 --> 00:42:13.464
when we're training.
but this is our last
nature workout.

867
00:42:13.599 --> 00:42:15.133
So I want you guys
to redline it.

868
00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.102
up that intensity
as high as you can.

869
00:42:17.202 --> 00:42:19.705
and really treat this one
like a competition. all right?

870
00:42:19.838 --> 00:42:22.808
So for workout number five.
we are going to be doing

871
00:42:22.974 --> 00:42:26.277
a modified Murph.
the original Hero WOD.

872
00:42:26.377 --> 00:42:29.681
Okay. we're going to substitute
kettlebell swings for pull-ups.

873
00:42:29.815 --> 00:42:32.984
and you're going to carry
your partner on the last leg.

874
00:42:33.151 --> 00:42:34.720
so that should be fun.

875
00:42:34.853 --> 00:42:36.622
And then. come on. come on.

876
00:42:37.689 --> 00:42:39.157
-Let's go.
-Come on.

877
00:42:40.726 --> 00:42:42.027
You got it.

878
00:42:44.329 --> 00:42:45.997
One more. one more. come on.

879
00:42:47.633 --> 00:42:48.700
All right. let's go.

880
00:42:49.868 --> 00:42:53.905
Nice. Nice.
Get it. get it. get it.
that's how it's done.

881
00:42:54.873 --> 00:42:57.008
Here we go. See that?

882
00:42:57.175 --> 00:42:58.376
This is dog and pony show.

883
00:42:58.509 --> 00:43:00.045
You're an athlete.
a real athlete.

884
00:43:00.178 --> 00:43:02.080
You wanna flip over
so I can rub your belly?

885
00:43:02.213 --> 00:43:04.182
You see what happens
when you do things right?

886
00:43:04.349 --> 00:43:05.751
-What? What happens?
-It hurts.

887
00:43:05.884 --> 00:43:07.418
[scream]

888
00:43:13.925 --> 00:43:16.494
Cam. you. you did this.

889
00:43:16.594 --> 00:43:18.429
Tara. can I please
just go check on Amari?

890
00:43:18.563 --> 00:43:20.666
Now you're concerned?
I told you from the get-go.

891
00:43:20.766 --> 00:43:23.702
These are ridiculous drills
so that you can act
like a leader.

892
00:43:23.869 --> 00:43:27.272
You have no control
over your team.
no control over your gym.

893
00:43:27.405 --> 00:43:30.942
-You should quit. really.
-No. Tara. you should quit.

894
00:43:32.277 --> 00:43:34.212
-[Kemp] You okay?
-Sweet ride.

895
00:43:35.714 --> 00:43:37.916
-Excuse me?
-I'm kicking you off the team.

896
00:43:38.049 --> 00:43:40.919
Are you fucking kidding me?
I'm the only one that
can do anything.

897
00:43:41.052 --> 00:43:44.222
-Babe. can we talk about this?
-You're wrong.
you can't do anything.

898
00:43:44.355 --> 00:43:46.391
Because you're not a member
of this team anymore.

899
00:43:46.557 --> 00:43:48.794
Just because you can lip
like a dude doesn't mean

900
00:43:48.927 --> 00:43:50.228
you have to act like a douche.

901
00:43:50.361 --> 00:43:51.730
We'd probably be
disqualified anyway

902
00:43:51.897 --> 00:43:54.065
if we kept you around
when the tests come back.

903
00:43:54.232 --> 00:43:56.067
and show that you're
carrying Y chromosomes.

904
00:43:56.201 --> 00:44:00.638
Get out of here.
and don't ever talk
to my husband that way again.

905
00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:03.441
The tribe has spoken.

906
00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:06.444
You are--

907
00:44:08.146 --> 00:44:09.748
It's Tara.

908
00:44:10.248 --> 00:44:12.951
Ah. GoPros.

909
00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:17.756
[sensual music playing]

910
00:44:21.259 --> 00:44:25.463
There's something
about the way you act to Tara.

911
00:44:25.596 --> 00:44:26.664
Yeah?

912
00:44:28.166 --> 00:44:29.667
You like it when I get hard?

913
00:44:29.801 --> 00:44:33.104
God. baby. when you get hard.
it makes me so hard.

914
00:44:38.143 --> 00:44:41.112
Stop being so soft.
you little bitch.

915
00:44:43.581 --> 00:44:45.250
Kiss me.

916
00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:46.517
What the hell. Laney?

917
00:44:47.418 --> 00:44:51.122
What? I was just
trying to turn you on.
I thought we were role playing.

918
00:44:52.657 --> 00:44:53.691
Soft?

919
00:44:55.026 --> 00:44:58.329
No. I thought that you
liked it when I took control.

920
00:44:59.865 --> 00:45:01.132
What?

921
00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:06.371
I'm not soft.

922
00:45:09.808 --> 00:45:12.978
-I know.
-I was about to make
a cut of my own.

923
00:45:13.111 --> 00:45:14.813
Until you jumped in there.

924
00:45:15.814 --> 00:45:18.817
You make me look like a fool.
and now you're calling me soft?

925
00:45:20.618 --> 00:45:22.620
I think it worked out just fine.

926
00:45:24.022 --> 00:45:26.024
Compared to what alternative?

927
00:45:28.126 --> 00:45:30.728
-Nothing.
-No. tell me what
you're thinking. Laney.

928
00:45:32.831 --> 00:45:34.232
Please. elaborate.

929
00:45:36.334 --> 00:45:38.403
I'm thinking I'm sorry.

930
00:45:39.805 --> 00:45:43.474
And that you can
make the decisions.

931
00:45:43.574 --> 00:45:47.745
And will you please forgive me?

932
00:45:49.848 --> 00:45:53.484
No. no. I really won't.

933
00:45:53.584 --> 00:45:54.419
Please?

934
00:45:54.552 --> 00:45:56.721
-Not now.
-[Laney] Cam.

935
00:45:58.523 --> 00:46:00.091
Where are you going?

936
00:46:01.927 --> 00:46:03.228
[door clicks closed]

937
00:46:21.712 --> 00:46:23.849
[clattering]

938
00:46:26.885 --> 00:46:31.122
[sirens wailing]

939
00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:37.262
[weights bang on floor]

940
00:46:38.063 --> 00:46:39.397
What are you doing here?

941
00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:44.569
Did you--
Did you leave the door open?

942
00:46:46.404 --> 00:46:47.738
Did you sneak in?

943
00:46:50.275 --> 00:46:53.111
This is insubordinate behavior.

944
00:46:54.712 --> 00:46:57.582
-Don't do that.
-[weights bang on floor]

945
00:46:57.715 --> 00:46:58.749
What?

946
00:46:58.884 --> 00:47:00.785
You don't know
anything about that.

947
00:47:00.919 --> 00:47:02.888
I know that you were
dishonorably discharged.

948
00:47:02.988 --> 00:47:04.755
Well. you don't have
the slightest clue.

949
00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:06.457
Which is funny
'cause you don't seem

950
00:47:06.591 --> 00:47:08.126
like the best teammate either.

951
00:47:08.259 --> 00:47:10.128
You read a couple
of Google search results.

952
00:47:10.261 --> 00:47:11.997
suddenly.
you think you're an expert.

953
00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:15.433
You think you know all
there is to know about a person.

954
00:47:16.734 --> 00:47:18.436
If you let
this team down in any way--

955
00:47:18.603 --> 00:47:22.607
What? What?
What are you going to do?

956
00:47:22.773 --> 00:47:24.442
Are you going to kick me out?

957
00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:26.912
Sorry.
but I already got the key.

958
00:47:27.012 --> 00:47:28.279
How'd you get that?

959
00:47:29.447 --> 00:47:30.982
-Stay here.
-Give me the key. Kemp.

960
00:47:31.116 --> 00:47:32.350
-This was given to me.
-By who?

961
00:47:32.483 --> 00:47:33.784
Who do you think?

962
00:47:35.286 --> 00:47:36.287
Why would she do that?

963
00:47:36.421 --> 00:47:37.956
I needed a place to stay.

964
00:47:38.089 --> 00:47:40.291
But why would she do that?

965
00:47:43.794 --> 00:47:46.364
You'll have to ask
your wife that question.

966
00:47:47.498 --> 00:47:50.936
[contemplating
instrumental playing]

967
00:48:01.879 --> 00:48:04.649
[Laney] He needed
a place to stay.
he was living on the street.

968
00:48:04.815 --> 00:48:07.953
-Then why didn't
you just tell me?
-Because it wasn't a big deal.

969
00:48:08.053 --> 00:48:10.655
If it wasn't a big deal.
then why didn't you
just tell me?

970
00:48:10.788 --> 00:48:12.823
[Laney]
Because it wasn't a big deal.

971
00:48:14.993 --> 00:48:18.229
-[Cam] Then
why didn't you just tell me?
-Because it wasn't a big deal.

972
00:48:18.363 --> 00:48:22.667
-If it wasn't a big deal.
then why didn't you tell me?
-Because it wasn't a big deal!

973
00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:31.242
You know what. you're right.

974
00:48:32.377 --> 00:48:35.813
I just-- I've been
feeling so much pressure.

975
00:48:35.913 --> 00:48:38.049
especially
with this reality show demands.

976
00:48:38.183 --> 00:48:41.352
and then I thought
he would be good for the movie.

977
00:48:41.486 --> 00:48:45.523
And you've been
pulling so much weight

978
00:48:45.656 --> 00:48:48.193
with that cool nature video
and all the extra members

979
00:48:48.359 --> 00:48:50.261
that signed up
because of it. and I--

980
00:48:52.197 --> 00:48:54.699
I just wanted to do my part.

981
00:48:54.832 --> 00:48:58.336
But you know what.
I'm-- I'm sorry.

982
00:48:59.504 --> 00:49:01.739
I shouldn't keep
secrets from you.

983
00:49:05.876 --> 00:49:08.613
No. No. I can't.

984
00:49:08.746 --> 00:49:10.448
I can't get away with that.

985
00:49:13.118 --> 00:49:14.919
I should be the one apologizing.

986
00:49:15.053 --> 00:49:17.188
[laughs] For what?

987
00:49:17.288 --> 00:49:20.358
Laney. I didn't take
the team out just for training.

988
00:49:21.226 --> 00:49:24.262
I took them out
to open up hours in the gym.

989
00:49:24.395 --> 00:49:26.397
We've been losing members.

990
00:49:28.133 --> 00:49:29.900
How many?

991
00:49:30.035 --> 00:49:32.537
Enough that
we can't last to the games.

992
00:49:33.571 --> 00:49:36.307
-Oh. my God.
-I have ideas and plans.

993
00:49:36.441 --> 00:49:38.743
-No. just stop.
-Shh. listen to me.
I can make it.

994
00:49:38.876 --> 00:49:42.747
No. no. no. no.
There's no I or me or you.

995
00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:45.416
It's just--
See. that's the problem.

996
00:49:45.583 --> 00:49:48.286
Everyone's feeling
so disenfranchised.

997
00:49:48.419 --> 00:49:51.422
Yeah. I know. I--
I definitely feel that.

998
00:49:51.556 --> 00:49:55.093
We need something
that will bring us together.

999
00:49:55.226 --> 00:49:56.327
We need to forge a moment

1000
00:49:56.461 --> 00:49:59.597
of solidarity between us

1001
00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:03.401
and the team and the gym and--

1002
00:50:03.501 --> 00:50:07.338
It's just--
What brings people together?

1003
00:50:09.607 --> 00:50:10.941
A paleo party?

1004
00:50:11.909 --> 00:50:15.080
I'm sorry. guys.
I kind of live here too.

1005
00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:17.315
That's an awesome idea.

1006
00:50:17.448 --> 00:50:18.816
It's a great idea.

1007
00:50:18.949 --> 00:50:21.286
And can I make
another suggestion?

1008
00:50:21.419 --> 00:50:23.921
Well. I know you guys were
looking to make some money.

1009
00:50:24.021 --> 00:50:27.358
and something
we used to do at my school
was offer date auctions.

Laney. baby! [laughing]

1031
00:51:46.504 --> 00:51:49.540
Oh. don't be so formal.
it's unsexy.

1032
00:51:49.674 --> 00:51:51.709
Sorry. just a little
nervous around you--

1033
00:51:51.842 --> 00:51:53.578
Shh. less is more.

1034
00:51:53.711 --> 00:51:56.046
Come on. be drunk with me.
let's be a friend.

1035
00:51:56.181 --> 00:51:57.715
Okay. are you having fun?

No. oh. you guys
want to see some of the footage?

1041
00:52:19.404 --> 00:52:22.573
-Absolutely.
-I have cameras
all over the place.

1042
00:52:22.707 --> 00:52:24.074
That's not creepy.

1043
00:52:24.242 --> 00:52:26.411
No. it's because a party

1044
00:52:26.544 --> 00:52:27.912
is so good for a show. you know?

1045
00:52:28.078 --> 00:52:31.148
-All right.
-No. hold on. hold on. hold on.

1046
00:52:31.282 --> 00:52:34.285
There's the porch with the pool.

1047
00:52:34.419 --> 00:52:36.221
And. oh. game room.

1048
00:52:36.321 --> 00:52:37.655
Oh. there's Cam.

00:52:40.558 --> 00:52:41.592
He's so cute.

1050
00:52:41.759 --> 00:52:43.160
-I know.
-Oh. yeah.

1051
00:52:43.294 --> 00:52:45.730
I thought you were
gonna be like Bruce Lee.

1052
00:52:45.830 --> 00:52:49.099
-Ever seen that video
of him playing with nunchucks?
-That's not real.

1053

-Yes. it is.
-[laughs] No. it's not.

1054
00:52:50.935 --> 00:52:54.272
-Oh. you're so gullible.
-Me?

1055
00:52:54.405 --> 00:52:56.741
You're the--
You're the innocent one.

1056
00:52:56.841 --> 00:52:59.076
[Hillary] Oh. no.
I'm just hustling you.

00:53:02.347 --> 00:53:04.515
You little hustler.

1059
00:53:04.649 --> 00:53:08.286
Come on. give me a break.
There's not a hustling bone
in your body.

1060
00:53:08.419 --> 00:53:10.621
I know. [laughs]

1061
00:53:14.525 --> 00:53:16.126
You're doing it again.

1062
00:53:18.296 --> 00:53:21.299
Sorry. I was just--

1063
00:53:21.466 --> 00:53:23.100
just wandered off.

1064
00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:26.136
You know me.
always flitting about.

be watching this.
-Fuck that. we're watching this.

-She's always probing.
probe more.
-[Hillary laughing]

1067
00:53:32.877 --> 00:53:35.713
You don't ask me for anything.

1068
00:53:35.846 --> 00:53:38.816
so I feel like
I can tell you everything.

1069
00:53:39.817 --> 00:53:41.686
-Like how I admire you.
-[Hillary laughing]

1070

You're what
I want to be when I grow up.

1071
00:53:44.154 --> 00:53:46.291
[Hillary] Oh. well.
you make me feel the same.

1072
00:53:46.391 --> 00:53:49.627
No. you're not allowed
to feel that way. missy.

1073
00:53:49.727 --> 00:53:51.362
Oh. but I do.

1074
00:53:51.496 --> 00:53:54.332
I feel like you're super brave.

1075
00:53:54.465 --> 00:53:56.301
-No. I'm not.
-You are.

1076
00:53:56.401 --> 00:53:57.702
I mean. the fact
that you gave up

1077
00:53:57.835 --> 00:54:00.538
an entire career in the NFL

1078
00:54:00.671 --> 00:54:03.240
just so you could
help other people
follow their dreams.

1079
00:54:03.374 --> 00:54:05.976
-I mean. you're an inspiration.
-I'm not an inspiration.

1080
00:54:06.076 --> 00:54:08.479
-You so are.
-I'm not an inspiration.

1081
00:54:08.579 --> 00:54:12.750
No. you are. I mean.
you made so many
sacrifices for everyone.

1082
00:54:12.883 --> 00:54:16.020
-And everything you do is just--
-It's not true.

1083
00:54:18.323 --> 00:54:21.426
Yeah. I didn't
give up an NFL career.

1084
00:54:21.559 --> 00:54:25.363
Found out I wasn't
going to get drafted.
and so I didn't enter.

1085
00:54:27.898 --> 00:54:29.567
I was never good enough.

1086
00:54:30.868 --> 00:54:32.870
I'm not toasting to that.

1087
00:54:34.339 --> 00:54:37.107
Yeah. you know--
You know who was good enough?

1088
00:54:37.241 --> 00:54:38.843
My brother. Jack.

1089
00:54:39.577 --> 00:54:43.047
So. do it with me.
in honor of Jack.

1090
00:54:56.193 --> 00:54:57.962
You want to know
the truth. Hill?

1091
00:55:00.365 --> 00:55:04.402
It was the night
of the state championship game.

1092
00:55:04.569 --> 00:55:07.137
and it-- it was the last play.

1093
00:55:07.271 --> 00:55:10.240
So. my brother.
he throws it long

1094
00:55:10.408 --> 00:55:12.276
to his favorite receiver.

1095
00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:14.912
a guy named Kemp.

1096
00:55:15.079 --> 00:55:18.749
So Kemp runs the wrong route.
and he calls my brother.

1097
00:55:18.916 --> 00:55:20.117
and it's perfect season.

1098
00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:22.753
so. you know.
we go out drinking after

1099
00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:24.489
in backwoods of Georgia.

1100
00:55:24.622 --> 00:55:26.991
wash it all away like kids do.

1101
00:55:27.124 --> 00:55:30.828
And so I tag along
with my big bro.

1102
00:55:31.762 --> 00:55:35.265
And so Jack starts drinking.

1103
00:55:35.433 --> 00:55:39.103
and like everything else.
he was good at it.

1104
00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:41.939
Yeah. no matter
how many shots he had.

1105
00:55:42.072 --> 00:55:43.941
you could never tell
that he was drunk.

1106
00:55:44.108 --> 00:55:46.477
He just-- He just
wouldn't let you see it.

1107
00:55:46.611 --> 00:55:48.012
And so that night.

1108
00:55:48.145 --> 00:55:50.781
the final high school
football game is done.

1109
00:55:50.915 --> 00:55:52.917
and he is just breaking
all the records.

1110
00:55:53.751 --> 00:55:57.455
The truth is. every kid
in that town worshipped him.

1111
00:55:57.622 --> 00:56:00.791
And the way he's
throwing them back that night.

1112
00:56:00.958 --> 00:56:02.493
he turned into a god.

1113
00:56:02.627 --> 00:56:05.129
And so they start chanting.
and they start pushing him

1114
00:56:05.262 --> 00:56:07.097
and pushing him
and pushing him. you know?

1115
00:56:07.197 --> 00:56:10.000
-And he's out for it. because--
-[glass clatters on floor]

1116
00:56:10.134 --> 00:56:11.469
Fuck!

1117
00:56:14.304 --> 00:56:17.975
The-- the only guy
that could keep up with him

1118
00:56:18.108 --> 00:56:20.678
was. you know. Kemp.

1119
00:56:21.479 --> 00:56:22.780
So they went at it.

1120
00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:24.615
and I-- I tried
to get them to stop.

1121
00:56:24.715 --> 00:56:27.818
but they wouldn't listen to me.
so I just piped down.

1122
00:56:27.952 --> 00:56:30.688
and I let everybody
worship Jack.

1123
00:56:31.989 --> 00:56:34.124
I should have made them stop.

1124
00:56:34.224 --> 00:56:36.827
But. you know.
I just-- I watched.

1125
00:56:36.961 --> 00:56:38.295
[sniffles]

1126
00:56:39.229 --> 00:56:41.799
And the next thing you know.

1127
00:56:41.899 --> 00:56:44.234
shot after shot. and then--

1128
00:56:49.006 --> 00:56:51.175
And he just never woke back up.

1129
00:56:53.043 --> 00:56:55.412
I think he was. you know--
he was taking painkillers

1130
00:56:55.546 --> 00:56:58.082
or something to cope with
the pressure of being perfect.

1131
00:56:58.215 --> 00:57:01.151
-Always probing for what?
-Babe. there you are.

1132
00:57:01.251 --> 00:57:04.021
Yeah. don't worry.
I'm done flitting about.

1133
00:57:06.924 --> 00:57:08.325
Are you spying on me?

1134
00:57:08.425 --> 00:57:09.994
I'm filming you.

1135
00:57:10.728 --> 00:57:12.096
[Cam] Unbelievable.

1136
00:57:12.229 --> 00:57:14.064
Yeah. that you
can't open up to me. it is.

1137
00:57:14.198 --> 00:57:17.735
Talking to you is like being
interviewed by TMZ. Laney.

1138
00:57:17.868 --> 00:57:19.704
I mean. you point
that thing in my face

1139
00:57:19.837 --> 00:57:21.506
every second
of our lives together.

1140
00:57:21.606 --> 00:57:24.542
Maybe if you
didn't hide your demons.
maybe if you opened up--

1141
00:57:24.675 --> 00:57:26.043
My demons?

1142
00:57:27.077 --> 00:57:29.213
How about your secrets?

1143
00:57:29.379 --> 00:57:32.049
-What about Kemp?
-I knew it.

1144
00:57:33.050 --> 00:57:36.386
-I knew you were jealous.
-Well. what would I
have to be jealous of?

1145
00:57:36.554 --> 00:57:38.055
Because I invited him.

1146
00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:44.061
Where is he?

1147
00:57:46.697 --> 00:57:48.799
-Where is that guy?
-Cam.

1148
00:57:50.635 --> 00:57:51.902
Cam.

1149
00:57:52.036 --> 00:57:55.239
[suspenseful
instrumental playing]

1150
00:58:02.279 --> 00:58:05.415
[Cam] Hey. Kemp.
I got a question for you. man.

1151
00:58:06.116 --> 00:58:07.918
Why'd you come back here?

1152
00:58:09.053 --> 00:58:10.254
I got my reasons.

1153
00:58:10.387 --> 00:58:12.289
Do that have
anything to do with her?

1154
00:58:13.090 --> 00:58:15.593
-A lot. Yeah.
-Yeah.

1155
00:58:15.726 --> 00:58:19.564
Mm-hmm. you always regretted
the one that got away. huh?

1156
00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:27.004
-I didn't come here
to steal my girl back.
-"My-- my girl"? "My girl"?

1157
00:58:27.137 --> 00:58:30.307
My bad.
I was never the one who
stole her in the first place.

1158
00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:31.976
You know that you left.
don't you?

1159
00:58:32.109 --> 00:58:33.844
That we had to
go on without you?

1160
00:58:33.978 --> 00:58:35.445
-Here it comes.
-Here what comes?

1161
00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:37.247
I know
you've been wanting to say this

1162
00:58:37.347 --> 00:58:39.249
the whole time
since I've gotten back here.

1163
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:41.686
You wouldn't know what I want.
'cause you weren't around

1164
00:58:41.819 --> 00:58:44.989
to know
what it was like afterwards.
me and her had to band together.

1165
00:58:45.122 --> 00:58:46.757
because we were all that we had.

1166
00:58:46.857 --> 00:58:49.093
-Is that why it happened?
-[Cam] Yeah.

1167
00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:53.530
It happened because
we were scared and alone.

1168
00:58:53.664 --> 00:58:57.802
Well. it's a good thing
you had each other
to band up with then. isn't it?

1169
00:58:57.968 --> 00:59:00.671
We did
what we had to do to survive.

1170
00:59:00.805 --> 00:59:03.641
Norcross. Georgia.
Dangerous place.

1171
00:59:03.808 --> 00:59:06.510
You act like you're the only one
who's been through some shit.

1172
00:59:06.644 --> 00:59:09.146
Don't you question
what I have been through. okay?

1173
00:59:09.279 --> 00:59:11.181

Go ahead. and blame me
for everything that happened.

for what happened.
-Go ahead and blame me for that.

-Yeah. you did.

-You fucking blamed me for it.
-[Cam] I never blamed you. man.

I lost one of them.

our lives have all been
a mess since that night.

But I just thought that maybe
if I invited you back.

you could help us
straighten things out again.

Well. it doesn't matter
what I believe.

All that matters
is the evidence.

con me into thinking

-I don't know that word.

It's in here.

1237
01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:47.331
You don't know me anymore.
I'm telling you who I am.

discharged soldier.

Well. if that's how you see
yourself. then it must be true.

1240
01:02:55.505 --> 01:02:59.243
I'm an idiot for thinking
that I see more in you.

How do you see yourself. Laney?

1242
01:03:04.348 --> 01:03:07.751
I mean. you tell me
that I'm detached.

1243
01:03:07.885 --> 01:03:10.554
but all you do is

1244
01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.222

1247
01:03:18.896 --> 01:03:20.730
you never reached out to me.

1248
01:03:21.531 --> 01:03:24.601
-[Laney] I'm reaching out
to you now.
-Why?

1249
01:03:24.734 --> 01:03:26.636
Why now?

1250
01:03:28.705 --> 01:03:31.141
Because it was a good excuse.

1251
01:03:37.047 --> 01:03:39.449
Just stop hiding from me.

1252
01:03:40.317 --> 01:03:42.452
Talk to me. please.

1253
01:03:44.554 --> 01:03:47.224
Laney. I know what
you're doing here. and I--

1254
01:03:47.324 --> 01:03:48.825
Tell me a story.

1255
01:03:49.927 --> 01:03:52.129
You want me to tell you
a cute little story?

1256
01:03:52.262 --> 01:03:53.663
[Laney] Yes.

1257
01:03:53.797 --> 01:03:56.133
Oh. jeez.

1258
01:03:56.266 --> 01:03:58.268
All right. Um...

1259
01:04:00.337 --> 01:04:03.807
My best one is Afghanistan.

1260
01:04:05.943 --> 01:04:08.312
I'm over there
with my buddy Davey.

1261
01:04:08.445 --> 01:04:10.948
and we're crushing raw eggs.

1262
01:04:11.081 --> 01:04:15.119
and playing Madden.
you know. guy stuff.

1263
01:04:15.252 --> 01:04:17.187
And he starts to just--
He takes a dump.

1264
01:04:17.321 --> 01:04:19.689
a big-- leaves the door open.

1265
01:04:19.823 --> 01:04:21.358
I try to get away
from the smell.

1266
01:04:21.491 --> 01:04:23.627
so I open up the door.

1267
01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:26.830
and I see a bottle of pills
lying right by there.

1268
01:04:26.964 --> 01:04:28.765
Valiums. [scoffs]

1269
01:04:28.865 --> 01:04:31.668
And I might have
a certain personal
association with Valiums.

1270
01:04:31.801 --> 01:04:34.204
and so I take them.
and I try to do the right thing.

1271
01:04:34.338 --> 01:04:35.305
snatch them.

1272
01:04:35.472 --> 01:04:37.975
And later that night.

1273
01:04:38.108 --> 01:04:40.844
I wake up to the sound

1274
01:04:40.978 --> 01:04:42.779
of mortar fire.

1275
01:04:42.879 --> 01:04:44.648
[imitates mortar fire]

1276

just pounding on my door.

1277
01:04:47.484 --> 01:04:50.620
It's like.
"Do you think I'm an addict?
You don't trust me?"

1278
01:04:51.956 --> 01:04:53.623
I felt bad.

1279
01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:57.527
So in a lifetime
full of bad decisions.

1280
01:04:57.661 --> 01:05:00.330
I made the second
worst one of my life.

1281
01:05:01.999 --> 01:05:04.701
I gave him back.
I not only gave him back.

1282
01:05:04.834 --> 01:05:08.038
I did one myself.
I mean. I didn't want him

1283
01:05:08.172 --> 01:05:10.140
to think I didn't trust him.

1284
01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:11.741
So the next morning.

1285
01:05:11.875 --> 01:05:13.843
we go wheels up.
just Davey suddenly runs out.

1286
01:05:14.011 --> 01:05:16.180
and goes to a wall
for a better vantage point.

1287
01:05:16.313 --> 01:05:18.315
He made no sense.

1288
01:05:18.415 --> 01:05:20.684
And I yell at him to get back.

1289
01:05:22.019 --> 01:05:23.988

1290
01:05:27.157 --> 01:05:28.392

There were no last words.

1293
01:05:45.042 --> 01:05:46.376

-Hmm?

that my brother was on pills?

with the first one.

01:21:00.123 --> 01:21:02.258
And I never told anyone.

1518
01:21:03.026 --> 01:21:05.794
Not even myself. I shut it out.

1519
01:21:05.929 --> 01:21:09.132
I made it
that it didn't even happen.

1520
01:21:09.298 --> 01:21:12.035
And I just wanted so bad...

1521
01:21:12.168 --> 01:21:15.471
[Cam whining]

1522
01:21:15.604 --> 01:21:17.440
...to make it okay.

1523
01:21:19.108 --> 01:21:22.811
I've always known.
and I can feel the gap.

1524
01:21:22.979 --> 01:21:24.347
I can feel the--

1525
01:21:25.148 --> 01:21:27.984
I hope that you can see me now.

1526
01:21:29.018 --> 01:21:30.153
[Laney] Oh. my God.

1527
01:21:30.286 --> 01:21:32.155
[Cam] I'm not my brother.

1528
01:21:32.288 --> 01:21:33.322
[Laney] Somebody help me!

1529
01:21:33.489 --> 01:21:34.857
Oh. my God.

1530
01:21:34.991 --> 01:21:38.227
And I've always tried to be him.

1531
01:21:40.129 --> 01:21:41.464
What happened?

1532
01:21:41.564 --> 01:21:44.633
[Cam] I tried to be perfect.

1533
01:21:44.733 --> 01:21:47.836
[indistinct chatter over phone]

1534
01:21:52.075 --> 01:21:53.709
Yes. thank you.

1535
01:21:53.842 --> 01:21:57.880
[fire crackling]

1536
01:22:08.891 --> 01:22:10.693
I tried to fill the gap.

1537
01:22:22.705 --> 01:22:25.941
[soft instrumental playing]

1538
01:23:02.245 --> 01:23:06.482
