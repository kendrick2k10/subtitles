5
00:00:15.867 --> 00:00:19.066
(upbeat bright music)

6
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.600
(waves crashing)

7
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.600
- Okay. Marco. it's time.

8
00:00:31.734 --> 00:00:33.700
You have one heart left
to give out tonight.

9
00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:35.900
What's going through your mind?

10
00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:37.433
- To be honest. Emily. so much.

11
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.266
Every one of these women are
special in their own way.

12
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.567
- I'd hate to fumble
the opening kickoff.

13
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.934
if you know what I mean.

14
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.000
- I'd hate to fumble
the opening kickoff.

15
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:47.333
if you know what I mean.

16
00:00:47.467 --> 00:00:49.433
- Using a football
analogy. Nice touch.

17
00:00:49.567 --> 00:00:51.166
- I thought so myself.

18
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.600
- I know this is
hard for you. Marco.

19
00:00:53.734 --> 00:00:55.033
Still. you have to choose.

20
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.667
Who's it gonna be?

21
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.400
(dramatic music)

22
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:05.800
Candace. will you step forward?

23
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.600
Will you accept this heart.

24
00:01:11.734 --> 00:01:13.333
continue this journey with me?

25
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.333
- (sobbing) I'm sorry.

26
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.934
(dramatic music)

27
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.266
- Cut. Resetting.

28
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.433
We'll pick it up from
Emily's question.

29
00:01:24.567 --> 00:01:26.467
- Resetting everybody.
Back to one.

30
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.166
- Don't even think about
cutting that camera.

31
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.233
Follow that contestant.

32
00:01:29.367 --> 00:01:31.000
- We don't have time.
We're losing the light.

33
00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:32.800
We've got to complete
this set up by sundown.

34
00:01:32.934 --> 00:01:34.166
- Just keep going. I'll get it.

35
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.333
- What was that Keith?

36
00:01:35.467 --> 00:01:36.967
- What's the big deal?

37
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.967
- The biggest drama of the
night just ran off in tears

38
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.767
and you stopped rolling.

39
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:39.600
That's the big deal.

40
00:01:39.734 --> 00:01:40.600
- Who cares?

41
00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:41.367
It's episode one.

42
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.967
Just have him pick someone else.

43
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.867
Props!

44
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.967
Let's get a fresh
heart out here.

45
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.033
- You're absolutely right.

46
00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:49.033
We could use a little
freshening up out here.

47
00:01:52.567 --> 00:01:55.066
- [Marco] Candace.
will you step forward?

48
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.066
Will you accept this heart.

49
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.667
continue this journey with me?

50
00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.800
- [Candace] (sobbing) I'm sorry.

51
00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:01.133
- It's the first episode.

52
00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:01.867
We can't end it with
Marco getting rejected.

53
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.200
It'll ruin his whole image.

54
00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:05.300
- Yeah. it's not a great look.

55
00:02:05.433 --> 00:02:06.500
- Maybe we can fix it.

56
00:02:09.767 --> 00:02:10.400
How are you feeling?

57
00:02:10.533 --> 00:02:12.200
You ready to talk?

58
00:02:12.333 --> 00:02:16.100
- (sobbing) I'm
just so embarrassed.

59
00:02:17.333 --> 00:02:19.166
I thought this would
help me get over my Ex.

60
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.100
but it just made
me miss him more.

61
00:02:23.433 --> 00:02:25.467
- [Luke] What would you say to
Marco if you had the chance?

62
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.266
- He's a really great guy

63
00:02:28.467 --> 00:02:31.467
and he deserves
someone really special.

64
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.900
- You shot this in high
resolution. I assume.

65
00:02:34.033 --> 00:02:34.900
- Do you even need to ask?

66
00:02:35.033 --> 00:02:36.233
- No. but the audio's suspect.

67
00:02:36.367 --> 00:02:37.834
We'll have to subtitle it.

68
00:02:37.967 --> 00:02:39.300
- Tough crowd.

69
00:02:39.433 --> 00:02:40.400
- Still...

70
00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:42.233
it works.

71
00:02:42.367 --> 00:02:44.000
Look at you Romeo.

72
00:02:44.133 --> 00:02:45.667
saving the episode.

73
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.367
- Just gotta run it by Keith.

74
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.867
- That might be difficult.

75
00:02:52.367 --> 00:02:53.266
- You fired him?

76
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.967
- Found his lack of respect
to be bit troubling.

77
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.533
I'm the executive producer.

78
00:02:57.667 --> 00:02:59.867
not an unpaid intern.

79
00:03:00.066 --> 00:03:01.900
- (scoffs) Who's
gonna take his place?

80
00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:05.400
- I have someone in mind.

81
00:03:07.166 --> 00:03:08.633
That is. if you
think they'll fit.

82
00:03:11.333 --> 00:03:12.967
- (scoffs) Uh...

83
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.200
(chuckles)

84
00:03:15.333 --> 00:03:16.300
- Don't let me down.

85
00:03:19.667 --> 00:03:22.400
(gentle music)

86
00:03:25.266 --> 00:03:26.967
- [Announcer] Welcome
back to another season

87
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.934
of "Heart Choices."

88
00:03:29.066 --> 00:03:31.934
It's time to meet this
year's King of Hearts.

89
00:03:32.066 --> 00:03:33.300
- [Marco] My name is Marco Tate.

90
00:03:33.433 --> 00:03:36.133
I'm 32 years old and
I'm ready to find love.

91
00:03:36.266 --> 00:03:37.767
- You're on a
dating show. buddy.

92
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.066
You better be.

93
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.900
- Shh! This is the
most important part.

94
00:03:41.033 --> 00:03:43.400
- I'm a former pro football
player from Columbus. Ohio.

95
00:03:43.533 --> 00:03:44.900
I'm super competitive.

96
00:03:45.033 --> 00:03:47.300
but I have a soft side as well.

97
00:03:47.433 --> 00:03:49.033
Here's to finding the
queen of my heart.

98
00:03:49.166 --> 00:03:49.767
Cheers.

99
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.467
- [All Girls] Cheers!

100
00:03:52.066 --> 00:03:53.033
- Athlete from the Midwest.

101
00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:55.900
Please. they could at at
least make it challenging.

102
00:03:56.033 --> 00:03:58.200
These are gonna be the easiest
fantasy picks I ever made.

103
00:03:58.333 --> 00:03:59.700
- He said like two words.

104
00:03:59.834 --> 00:04:01.266
How do you know who
he's gonna pick?

105
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.800
- We all have our skills.

106
00:04:02.934 --> 00:04:05.533
Mine just happens
to be a useless one.

107
00:04:05.667 --> 00:04:08.200
- [Announcer] Stay tuned
to meet the 16 lucky ladies

108
00:04:08.333 --> 00:04:09.934
that will fight for his hand

109
00:04:10.066 --> 00:04:13.467
on this season of
"Heart Choices."

110
00:04:15.433 --> 00:04:18.500
- None of you guys
are here for Marco.

111
00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:20.033
- They're gonna make
this one the villain.

112
00:04:20.166 --> 00:04:21.333
- And how do you know this?

113
00:04:21.467 --> 00:04:23.000
- The villains are
always pointing.

114
00:04:23.133 --> 00:04:24.433
- People think that I'm shallow.

115
00:04:24.567 --> 00:04:26.767
but I'm actually. I'm deep.

116
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.333
I'm talking. I'm ocean deep.

117
00:04:28.467 --> 00:04:31.367
- And always have
non-existent jobs.

118
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.600
- My favorite animal of the sea
would have to be the dolphin

119
00:04:34.734 --> 00:04:36.433
because they seem
sweet and innocent.

120
00:04:36.567 --> 00:04:38.633
but they can kill sharks.

121
00:04:38.767 --> 00:04:39.500
So.

122
00:04:39.633 --> 00:04:40.967
- I'm keeping my
eye on this one.

123
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.667
She's a shoo-in for the semis.

124
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.300
- [Candace] It's
my absolute passion

125
00:04:44.433 --> 00:04:46.266
to bring delectable
treats to people.

126
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.433
And I can't wait for
Marco to try them.

127
00:04:48.567 --> 00:04:49.667
- Okay. hot shot.

128
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.300
what's gonna happen
with Candace D?

129
00:04:52.433 --> 00:04:54.433
- Oh. she's a top
five pick for me.

130
00:04:54.567 --> 00:04:56.367
but I smell a secret.

131
00:04:58.433 --> 00:05:00.400
- I know this is
hard for you. Marco.

132
00:05:00.533 --> 00:05:01.834
Still. you have to choose.

133
00:05:01.967 --> 00:05:03.100
Who's it gonna be?

134
00:05:03.233 --> 00:05:05.266
- Candace. will
you step forward?

135
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.400
- Here it comes.

136
00:05:07.533 --> 00:05:08.500
Wait for it.

137
00:05:08.633 --> 00:05:09.834
- Will you accept this heart.

138
00:05:09.967 --> 00:05:11.567
continue this journey with me?

139
00:05:12.467 --> 00:05:15.367
- (sobbing) I'm sorry.

140
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.734
- [Announcer] Can the
King of Hearts recover

141
00:05:19.867 --> 00:05:21.934
from unexpected rejection?

142
00:05:22.066 --> 00:05:26.166
Tune in next week to find
out on "Heart's Choices?"

143
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.367
- Did I call it or what?

144
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.900
- I never should have
doubted you. well done.

145
00:05:32.033 --> 00:05:34.900
- Well done yourself.
It's gorgeous.

146
00:05:35.033 --> 00:05:36.233
- You think so?

147
00:05:36.367 --> 00:05:37.500
I'm so nervous about
my meeting tomorrow

148
00:05:37.633 --> 00:05:39.233
that I thought I should at least
put one more look together.

149
00:05:39.367 --> 00:05:40.200
- Oh. my gosh.

150
00:05:40.333 --> 00:05:42.266
Your investor meeting.
that's tomorrow?

151
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.333
- Katie Creighton of
Creighton Metro Capital.

152
00:05:44.467 --> 00:05:45.934
3:00 PM sharp.

153
00:05:46.066 --> 00:05:48.867
- I'm officially the
worst. I completely forgot.

154
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.367
I never would've made you
watch mindless TV with me.

155
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.266
- Oh. no. It's fine.

156
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.367
I needed something
to distract me.

157
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.600
My head is in a million
places right now.

158
00:05:56.734 --> 00:05:59.266
- Your designs are unique and
your business plan is solid.

159
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.567
Your golden.

160
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:01.333
- Thank you.

161
00:06:01.467 --> 00:06:03.066
I'm trying to not be nervous.

162
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.667
but after all the work
I've put into this.

163
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.066
it's hard to not worry
about the rejection.

164
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.467
Not to mention how badly I
want to stop waiting tables

165
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.567
and put all my energy into this.

166
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:12.600
- You'll get there.

167
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.500
- You really think so?

168
00:06:15.633 --> 00:06:16.467
- I know so.

169
00:06:19.533 --> 00:06:22.000
(gentle music)

170
00:06:25.567 --> 00:06:27.600
- The designs feel
fresh. That's a start.

171
00:06:28.467 --> 00:06:29.667
- Thanks.

172
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.667
- Production could
use a little work.

173
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.600
- Okay.

174
00:06:32.734 --> 00:06:33.467
- Who makes your patterns?

175
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.000
- I do actually.

176
00:06:35.133 --> 00:06:36.333
- Hmm.

177
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.333
How do you plan to scale?

178
00:06:38.467 --> 00:06:39.400
- Well. as you'll see
in my business plan.

179
00:06:39.533 --> 00:06:40.467
once I get seed money.

180
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.934
I'm going to focus a healthy
portion on marketing.

181
00:06:43.066 --> 00:06:45.800
- I guess my biggest
question is. why?

182
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.633
Why should women buy from you?

183
00:06:48.767 --> 00:06:50.500
How do you rise above the noise?

184
00:06:50.633 --> 00:06:52.967
- Well. on page 8 of
my pitch deck there's-

185
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.467
- This isn't something you
can find in a pitch deck.

186
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.400
This is something you have
to go out there and earn.

187
00:06:57.533 --> 00:06:59.266
You're very talented.

188
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.433
I don't think you're quite
what we're looking for at CMC.

189
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.000
- So what exactly
are you looking for?

190
00:07:07.133 --> 00:07:08.667
- If you expect us to
go above and beyond

191
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.400
to make Silver Halo
a household name.

192
00:07:10.533 --> 00:07:12.533
we expect you to
be doing the same.

193
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.567
(Hayley sighs)

194
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.700
(gentle music)

195
00:07:19.834 --> 00:07:24.433
(door creaks open)
- Congratulations!

196
00:07:27.834 --> 00:07:29.066
How did she not invest?

197
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.900
Your designs are next level.

198
00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:32.967
- Apparently my
work ethic isn't.

199
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.633
- You're the hardest
worker I know.

200
00:07:34.767 --> 00:07:37.033
- She doesn't think I'm
willing to go above and beyond

201
00:07:37.166 --> 00:07:37.967
for my brand.

202
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.467
What does that even mean?

203
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.333
- It means you'll
find another partner.

204
00:07:41.467 --> 00:07:42.367
Someone better.

205
00:07:43.467 --> 00:07:44.333
- You're the best.

206
00:07:49.867 --> 00:07:52.567
Okay. Spill it.

207
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:53.667
- Okay. fine.

208
00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.166
But I feel bad telling
you when you're so sad.

209
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.834
- I will feel a lot
worse if you don't.

210
00:07:56.967 --> 00:07:57.900
- Okay.

211
00:07:58.033 --> 00:07:59.867
So I happened to be
browsing a few fan sites

212
00:08:00.066 --> 00:08:01.900
for "Heart Choices."
as I am known to do.

213
00:08:02.033 --> 00:08:05.533
And I may have stumbled
on a special announcement.

214
00:08:05.667 --> 00:08:06.633
- And?

215
00:08:06.767 --> 00:08:08.266
- They're coming to the Bay Area

216
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.433
to cast mid-season
replacements tomorrow.

217
00:08:11.567 --> 00:08:12.400
I'm totally going.

218
00:08:12.533 --> 00:08:13.633
- You're totally kidding. right?

219
00:08:13.767 --> 00:08:15.400
(quirky music)

220
00:08:15.533 --> 00:08:17.300
Oh. okay.

221
00:08:17.433 --> 00:08:18.600
- Yay!

222
00:08:18.734 --> 00:08:21.300
(both giggling)

223
00:08:23.433 --> 00:08:24.734
I still can't believe
you're doing this.

224
00:08:24.867 --> 00:08:26.367
- Why?

225
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:27.033
You're the one who said
I needed to get out more.

226
00:08:27.166 --> 00:08:28.033
- Not like this.

227
00:08:28.166 --> 00:08:29.633
- Hayley. if I get this.

228
00:08:29.767 --> 00:08:31.533
I'll be wearing evening
gowns half the time.

229
00:08:31.667 --> 00:08:32.600
your evening gowns.

230
00:08:32.734 --> 00:08:34.433
Do you know how much that
could help your sales?

231
00:08:34.567 --> 00:08:35.767
- Yeah. all for the
price of my best friend.

232
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:36.567
Sold.

233
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.233
- Don't be so dramatic.

234
00:08:38.367 --> 00:08:39.734
It's a game.

235
00:08:39.867 --> 00:08:42.200
a game I'm gonna
be really good at.

236
00:08:42.333 --> 00:08:43.633
- Hold up. What's this?

237
00:08:43.767 --> 00:08:45.467
- Relax. it's a photo release.

238
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.700
Just means if we're
on the premises.

239
00:08:46.834 --> 00:08:47.700
we're agreeing to be filmed.

240
00:08:47.834 --> 00:08:49.100
- What? I never agreed to that.

241
00:08:49.233 --> 00:08:52.066
- If you're so paranoid.
just wait outside.

242
00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.467
But. if you are the
least bit curious

243
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.667
to peek behind the curtain.

244
00:08:57.734 --> 00:08:59.800
I'll be on the seventh floor.

245
00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.633
- The right to edit or alter.

246
00:09:02.767 --> 00:09:03.800
What?

247
00:09:06.934 --> 00:09:08.600
- You here for the casting?

248
00:09:08.734 --> 00:09:10.000
- No. no. my friend is.

249
00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:11.700
I'm just here for moral support.

250
00:09:11.834 --> 00:09:12.834
- Oh.

251
00:09:12.967 --> 00:09:14.867
Well. you can't provide a
whole lot of moral support

252
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.533
from down here. can you?

253
00:09:16.667 --> 00:09:18.767
- True. but there's a part of me

254
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.300
that wants to
protest her decision.

255
00:09:20.433 --> 00:09:22.200
and I haven't decided
which side is gonna win.

256
00:09:22.333 --> 00:09:25.200
- Hmm. must not be a big
fan of the show then. huh?

257
00:09:25.333 --> 00:09:26.667
- I mean. it's fine.

258
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.467
if you want to veg
out for two hours.

259
00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.433
But the overall concept
is pretty ridiculous.

260
00:09:32.567 --> 00:09:33.433
Love is something
that just happens.

261
00:09:33.567 --> 00:09:34.467
it can't be staged.

262
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.667
- Well. you'd be amazed
at what we can do

263
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.467
in the editing room.

264
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.767
- You're with the show?

265
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.667
- Come to the seventh
floor. and find out.

266
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.533
(quirky music)

267
00:09:49.667 --> 00:09:50.700
Wow. Great.

268
00:09:50.834 --> 00:09:52.133
Really great stuff. Carla.

269
00:09:52.266 --> 00:09:52.934
thank you so much.

270
00:09:53.066 --> 00:09:54.700
Really unique.

271
00:09:54.834 --> 00:09:55.700
We'll let you know
if we need you.

272
00:09:55.834 --> 00:09:57.600
- Oh. what about me?

273
00:09:57.734 --> 00:09:59.934
- Oh. hey. don't worry. Darla.

274
00:10:00.066 --> 00:10:01.200
you're in the mix. too.

275
00:10:02.667 --> 00:10:05.066
- [Darla The Dummy] Bye-bye.

276
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.934
- Puppet girls out. I take it.

277
00:10:10.066 --> 00:10:12.433
- Unfortunately her dummy
was way more interesting

278
00:10:12.567 --> 00:10:13.233
than she was.

279
00:10:13.367 --> 00:10:14.600
- It is slim pickings out here.

280
00:10:14.734 --> 00:10:16.300
Are you sure this
was a good idea?

281
00:10:16.433 --> 00:10:17.700
- I had to do something.

282
00:10:17.834 --> 00:10:19.367
Emily is expecting
big things out of me.

283
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.633
I have to deliver.

284
00:10:20.767 --> 00:10:21.367
- Well. if you
could hurry it up.

285
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.700
I'd appreciate it.

286
00:10:22.834 --> 00:10:24.367
- Hey. you are in one
of my favorite cities

287
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.300
with one of your favorite
co-workers. okay.

288
00:10:26.433 --> 00:10:27.934
Try and enjoy yourself.

289
00:10:28.066 --> 00:10:30.100
- I would if I thought
this was going to pay off.

290
00:10:30.233 --> 00:10:31.667
So far it's a bust
and you know it.

291
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.834
- Just sip your latte
and be patient. okay.

292
00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:35.767
She's out there. I feel it.

293
00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.834
- Uh. you know. I
don't do feelings.

294
00:10:38.667 --> 00:10:39.667
- Next!

295
00:10:41.133 --> 00:10:43.166
(quirky music)

296
00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.433
I'm gonna take five.

297
00:10:44.567 --> 00:10:45.400
This is all you.

298
00:10:48.834 --> 00:10:49.834
- Hi.

299
00:10:50.734 --> 00:10:51.700
Oh. Wow.

300
00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.333
- I knew you'd come.

301
00:10:56.467 --> 00:10:57.533
- Of course. you knew.

302
00:10:57.667 --> 00:10:58.834
What was my tell?

303
00:10:58.967 --> 00:11:00.567
- Just that you love me

304
00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:01.700
and you secretly want to
help me crush this thing.

305
00:11:01.834 --> 00:11:04.333
- Okay. Well. let's get to work.

306
00:11:04.467 --> 00:11:05.700
- Okay.

307
00:11:05.834 --> 00:11:07.533
- Why do you want
to be with Marco?

308
00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:08.600
- Free vacation to Hawaii.

309
00:11:08.734 --> 00:11:10.834
- Whoa. way too honest.

310
00:11:10.967 --> 00:11:12.600
- Because we're
destined to be together.

311
00:11:12.734 --> 00:11:14.734
- Lot of conviction for
a man you've never met.

312
00:11:14.867 --> 00:11:17.033
Maybe we try something
like in the middle.

313
00:11:17.166 --> 00:11:18.567
- I'm willing to do
the work that it takes

314
00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.033
to build a long and
lasting relationship.

315
00:11:21.166 --> 00:11:22.667
If Marco shares those values.

316
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.667
then it was meant to be.

317
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.367
- Well. now you're scaring me.

318
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:27.734
- I told you. I'm good at this.

319
00:11:27.867 --> 00:11:29.700
- So go on a game
show and win a car.

320
00:11:29.834 --> 00:11:31.500
- Or go on this
and win a fiance.

321
00:11:31.633 --> 00:11:32.567
- Cars are a lot
easier to trade in.

322
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.166
- Look. you've made it
clear this is a bad idea.

323
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:36.567
- Terrible idea. but go on.

324
00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.200
- But I'll be doing it
all in your dresses.

325
00:11:39.333 --> 00:11:40.834
building a following
for your line.

326
00:11:40.967 --> 00:11:43.000
- Eh. I'll find some other
way to reach the masses.

327
00:11:43.133 --> 00:11:45.900
- Okay. look. it's
not only about you.

328
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.200
I have a plan.

329
00:11:49.333 --> 00:11:52.533
I don't want to win. I
want first runner up.

330
00:11:52.667 --> 00:11:53.767
- Because?

331
00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:54.667
- Because first runner up

332
00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.900
becomes Queen of
Hearts next season.

333
00:11:57.033 --> 00:11:58.767
And statistically
couples last longer

334
00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.300
when the woman picks.

335
00:12:00.433 --> 00:12:02.734
Move over. Marco.
it's my time to shine.

336
00:12:02.867 --> 00:12:04.967
- Bree Manford!

337
00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:05.834
- That's me.

338
00:12:07.433 --> 00:12:09.800
- Why don't you have your
friend come in as well.

339
00:12:09.934 --> 00:12:11.467
You know. for moral support.

340
00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:14.000
- Please.

341
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.600
- [Luke] You've got it.

342
00:12:19.734 --> 00:12:20.934
- [Both] Are you serious?

343
00:12:21.066 --> 00:12:22.800
- I wouldn't joke about
offering you a spot

344
00:12:22.934 --> 00:12:24.333
on "Heart Choices."

345
00:12:24.467 --> 00:12:26.633
- (chuckles) But her audition
hasn't even started yet.

346
00:12:26.767 --> 00:12:28.600
- Well. let's just
say we've seen enough.

347
00:12:28.734 --> 00:12:29.834
- Great.
- How?

348
00:12:29.967 --> 00:12:31.800
- Well. casting for
a show like this

349
00:12:31.934 --> 00:12:33.767
is more of an art
than a science.

350
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:34.734
I got to go with my gut.

351
00:12:34.867 --> 00:12:36.734
And so far. my gut
has not let me down.

352
00:12:36.867 --> 00:12:39.433
I really think Marco
and all of Heart Nation

353
00:12:39.567 --> 00:12:41.100
will be very interested in you.

354
00:12:42.066 --> 00:12:43.800
Now for the contracts.

355
00:12:43.934 --> 00:12:44.800
- Awfully thick.

356
00:12:44.934 --> 00:12:46.800
- Well. that's because
there's two of them.

357
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.834
One for each of you.

358
00:12:49.967 --> 00:12:50.834
The network likes the idea

359
00:12:50.967 --> 00:12:53.567
of best friends going
on the show together.

360
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.000
- By the network. you mean you?

361
00:12:55.133 --> 00:12:58.400
- Well. I represent
the network. so yes.

362
00:12:58.533 --> 00:13:02.300
Usually the women on the
show are frenemies at best.

363
00:13:02.433 --> 00:13:03.967
I think it would be
great to showcase

364
00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:05.200
a true friendship. for once.

365
00:13:05.333 --> 00:13:06.533
- So why not just
get two best friends

366
00:13:06.667 --> 00:13:07.967
who are actually
fans of the show?

367
00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:10.000
I mean. I already told
you how I feel about it.

368
00:13:10.133 --> 00:13:12.066
- Well. I think it
would be refreshing

369
00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.667
to have a skeptic on the show.

370
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.133
have a contestant that
the other half of America

371
00:13:16.266 --> 00:13:17.100
will relate to.

372
00:13:18.033 --> 00:13:19.967
- I'm sorry. but
it's not happening.

373
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.500
at least not for me.

374
00:13:21.633 --> 00:13:25.367
- Well. unfortunately we
have to take both of you

375
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:26.967
or neither of you.

376
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.467
So the choice is yours.

377
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.200
(quirky music)

378
00:13:32.333 --> 00:13:33.500
- Can we have a minute?

379
00:13:34.367 --> 00:13:34.934
- Absolutely.

380
00:13:37.867 --> 00:13:39.367
- Uh. with the camera off.

381
00:13:41.633 --> 00:13:42.500
Thanks.

382
00:13:44.367 --> 00:13:45.700
- Hayley. this is great.

383
00:13:45.834 --> 00:13:47.500
We can both wear your dresses.

384
00:13:47.633 --> 00:13:49.967
the promotion will be priceless.

385
00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.133
- You don't think it
feels too fake. too weird.

386
00:13:51.266 --> 00:13:52.567
- It's a week in Hawaii with me.

387
00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:53.633
How bad can it get?

388
00:13:53.767 --> 00:13:55.900
- I don't know if you
want me to answer that.

389
00:13:56.033 --> 00:13:58.300
- Don't think of it as anything
but a business decision.

390
00:13:58.433 --> 00:13:59.066
That's all.

391
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.934
That investor you met with asked

392
00:14:01.066 --> 00:14:03.700
if you would go above and
beyond for your business.

393
00:14:03.834 --> 00:14:04.700
what do you call this?

394
00:14:04.834 --> 00:14:06.967
- This is beyond. beyond.

395
00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:08.934
But yeah. I see your point.

396
00:14:09.066 --> 00:14:10.767
Maybe this is a way to prove

397
00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.133
that I am willing to
think outside the box

398
00:14:13.266 --> 00:14:14.633
to promote my brand.

399
00:14:14.767 --> 00:14:15.867
- Yes!

400
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.567
- But still I
don't love the idea

401
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:18.867
of putting our
privacy in the hands

402
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.600
of that scheming producer.

403
00:14:20.734 --> 00:14:22.400
- You two done
talking about me yet?

404
00:14:22.533 --> 00:14:23.734
So. what's it gonna be?

405
00:14:23.867 --> 00:14:26.400
(Hayley sighs)

406
00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:29.100
(bright music)

407
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.433
- Wow.

408
00:14:45.567 --> 00:14:47.700
Can you believe this?

409
00:14:47.834 --> 00:14:48.967
It's beautiful.

410
00:14:49.867 --> 00:14:51.700
- What have we done.

411
00:14:51.834 --> 00:14:54.266
(bright music)

412
00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.066
- I made a flow chart of how
the next week could play out

413
00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.200
on the flight.

414
00:14:57.333 --> 00:14:58.900
If we stick to the plan
we all get what we want

415
00:14:59.033 --> 00:15:00.300
and no one gets hurt.

416
00:15:00.433 --> 00:15:01.533
- This really is a game to you.

417
00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:03.600
- Eyes on the prize. baby.

418
00:15:03.734 --> 00:15:05.667
eyes on the prize.
- Oh boy.

419
00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.033
what am I gonna do with you?

420
00:15:11.934 --> 00:15:14.133
Hi. I'm Hayley. if you remember.

421
00:15:14.266 --> 00:15:15.967
I think we met briefly
at the audition.

422
00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.867
- I appreciate the refresher.

423
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:18.867
Now. cough it up.

424
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.467
- She wants your phone.

425
00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.100
- Oh. look. somebody read
their welcome packet.

426
00:15:23.233 --> 00:15:24.433
For those of you who forgot.

427
00:15:24.567 --> 00:15:27.100
My name is Marie and
I am your first AD.

428
00:15:27.233 --> 00:15:29.300
aka Assistant Director.

429
00:15:29.433 --> 00:15:32.166
aka your worst nightmare
if you don't do what I say.

430
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.367
Have you read your contracts?

431
00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.533
Nope. No one does.

432
00:15:35.667 --> 00:15:36.633
So I'll sum it up.

433
00:15:36.767 --> 00:15:37.633
Rule number one.

434
00:15:37.767 --> 00:15:39.967
for the next seven
days you belong to us.

435
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:42.834
No devices. no news.
no social media.

436
00:15:42.967 --> 00:15:45.834
We shoot the episodes a
few weeks before they air.

437
00:15:45.967 --> 00:15:48.767
So whatever goes down on
set. keep it to yourself.

438
00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:49.900
- What if we slip up
and say something?

439
00:15:50.033 --> 00:15:53.000
- You see how many people
piled out on that golf cart?

440
00:15:53.133 --> 00:15:56.166
We have three times as many
lawyers back at the studio.

441
00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:59.100
So that thought along
with this riveting speech

442
00:15:59.233 --> 00:16:01.734
should keep you
from slipping up.

443
00:16:01.867 --> 00:16:05.166
Rule two. the minute you
step out of your bungalow.

444
00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.867
the cameras are
on. mics are live.

445
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:07.900
If you don't want to filmed.

446
00:16:08.033 --> 00:16:08.934
don't say it.

447
00:16:09.066 --> 00:16:11.567
Three. stay away from Marco...

448
00:16:12.467 --> 00:16:14.100
unless we're here to film it.

449
00:16:14.233 --> 00:16:16.100
I do not like secret rendezvous.

450
00:16:16.233 --> 00:16:17.667
You did not come
here for privacy.

451
00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.433
so get that out
of your head now.

452
00:16:19.567 --> 00:16:20.400
Rule number four.

453
00:16:20.533 --> 00:16:22.266
stay away from the fountains.

454
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.266
- Wait. what's in the fountains?

455
00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.166
- A mixture of arsenic
and sulfuric acid.

456
00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:27.066
- Serious.

457
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.133
- Of course not.

458
00:16:28.266 --> 00:16:30.367
But I'm serious about
staying away from them.

459
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.100
- Right? Sorry. I
was just curious.

460
00:16:32.233 --> 00:16:33.433
- Don't be curious.

461
00:16:33.567 --> 00:16:36.066
That's not a rule. but
still that annoys me.

462
00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.000
Believe me. life is much
better when I'm not annoyed.

463
00:16:39.133 --> 00:16:40.433
Rule number five.

464
00:16:40.567 --> 00:16:42.533
your best friend around here is-

465
00:16:42.667 --> 00:16:43.600
- Let me guess?

466
00:16:43.734 --> 00:16:46.734
You. (chuckles)

467
00:16:46.867 --> 00:16:47.533
Okay.

468
00:16:47.667 --> 00:16:48.867
Sorry. Yeah.

469
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:49.367
I sometimes like to
joke. but I won't...

470
00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.033
I won't do that.

471
00:16:50.166 --> 00:16:51.934
- It's your call sheet.

472
00:16:52.066 --> 00:16:54.166
It lists out a personal
schedule of where you should be

473
00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.500
and when you should be there.

474
00:16:55.633 --> 00:16:57.867
What's the first
thing your says?

475
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.166
- "Bree. lobby B-roll. 1:30."

476
00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.600
Perfect. I'll have time
to do some yoga first.

477
00:17:03.734 --> 00:17:05.734
- Oh. good call. I could
use a good stretch.

478
00:17:05.867 --> 00:17:06.800
- Oh. really? So could I.

479
00:17:06.934 --> 00:17:09.233
I would love to breathe
in some good intentions.

480
00:17:09.367 --> 00:17:11.266
Too bad our call
sheet says otherwise.

481
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:15.767
- Uh. "Hayley interview.
overlook noon."

482
00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.100
That's in ten minutes.

483
00:17:17.233 --> 00:17:19.266
- Mm. best lighting
in the whole place.

484
00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.667
Better take some selfies.

485
00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.000
- I can't though.
you took my phone.

486
00:17:22.133 --> 00:17:23.100
- I know.

487
00:17:23.233 --> 00:17:24.433
(Marie laughs)

488
00:17:24.567 --> 00:17:26.100
Sometimes I like to joke. too.

489
00:17:26.233 --> 00:17:29.166
(quirky music)
(both awkwardly laughing)

490
00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.834
- [Bree] We got to hurry.

491
00:17:30.967 --> 00:17:31.800
You don't want to be late
for your first interview.

492
00:17:31.934 --> 00:17:34.467
- Live mics. golf
carts full of lawyers.

493
00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:35.467
Are we really doing this?

494
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:36.433
- Oh. come on.

495
00:17:36.567 --> 00:17:38.166
What happened to going
above and beyond?

496
00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:40.233
- I'm trying. there's
just one problem.

497
00:17:40.367 --> 00:17:42.967
How am I gonna pretend to
be smitten with Marco Tate

498
00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.100
of Columbus. Ohio?

499
00:17:45.233 --> 00:17:47.133
I don't know how
long I can fake this.

500
00:17:47.266 --> 00:17:48.433
- Might not be much longer.

501
00:17:48.567 --> 00:17:50.967
There's an elimination
ceremony tonight.

502
00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:53.533
Three girls get a heart.
three girls get sent home.

503
00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.333
- "Formal attire required."

504
00:17:59.567 --> 00:18:01.800
There's a way I can win tonight.

505
00:18:01.934 --> 00:18:03.300
I'll wear one of my
best evening gowns.

506
00:18:03.433 --> 00:18:05.300
get my dress noticed
by millions of people.

507
00:18:05.433 --> 00:18:07.133
get eliminated
and get sent home.

508
00:18:07.266 --> 00:18:08.667
- Well. what if Marco
gives you a heart?

509
00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.233
- He won't. I'll
make sure of it.

510
00:18:11.367 --> 00:18:14.734
If anyone can blow their chances
with America's heartthrob.

511
00:18:14.867 --> 00:18:16.166
it's yours truly.

512
00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:17.734
(both laughing)

513
00:18:17.867 --> 00:18:19.500
- Enough chit-chat lady.
(golf cart honking)

514
00:18:19.633 --> 00:18:22.166
time to go!
- Oh. boy.

515
00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:24.500
- Well. good luck.

516
00:18:24.633 --> 00:18:25.400
- Thanks.

517
00:18:26.834 --> 00:18:28.100
(sighs) Here we go.

518
00:18:35.033 --> 00:18:36.233
I have a question.

519
00:18:36.367 --> 00:18:38.266
Well. I have several. actually.

520
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.433
- How about I just call
you Curious from now on?

521
00:18:40.567 --> 00:18:43.166
- I just need to know what
this interview is all about.

522
00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:45.767
- We use it to introduce
you to the audience.

523
00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:47.233
Hayley. 20-something.

524
00:18:47.367 --> 00:18:49.266
why you want to be with Marco?

525
00:18:50.533 --> 00:18:53.000
- Why I want to be with Marco?

526
00:18:54.233 --> 00:18:56.900
I hadn't really thought
about that too deeply.

527
00:18:57.033 --> 00:19:00.467
- Well. you got about a 10
seconds while they mic you up.

528
00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.467
You'll think of something.

529
00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.567
- Is there someone else
who can interview me?

530
00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:05.900
- Honey. Luke is the showrunner.

531
00:19:06.033 --> 00:19:06.967
you might as well
get used to him.

532
00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.166
- I just feel like he
manipulates the questions

533
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.867
to make you say what he wants.

534
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.066
- Welcome to reality TV.

535
00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.400
(gentle guitar music)

536
00:19:19.433 --> 00:19:20.233
- Perfect.

537
00:19:20.367 --> 00:19:21.667
You ready?

538
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:22.467
- [Hayley] Yup.

539
00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:23.333
Ready as I'll ever be.

540
00:19:23.467 --> 00:19:24.367
- All right.

541
00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:25.266
Right here. Here we go.

542
00:19:29.367 --> 00:19:32.567
(gentle serene music)

543
00:19:37.767 --> 00:19:39.300
- Can I ask what
you're doing. exactly.

544
00:19:39.433 --> 00:19:41.967
- Just doing a little
yoga while I have a break.

545
00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:45.133
- Yeah. I could see that.
but why are you blindfolded?

546
00:19:45.266 --> 00:19:48.467
- Partly to prevent distractions
from random strangers.

547
00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.734
- My bad.

548
00:19:49.867 --> 00:19:52.233
- But mostly to
strengthen my core.

549
00:19:52.367 --> 00:19:55.533
With your eyes closed. it's
much harder to balance.

550
00:19:55.667 --> 00:19:57.567
- To be honest. nothing
about that looks hard.

551
00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:59.233
- Well give it a try tough guy.

552
00:19:59.367 --> 00:20:00.900
- I thought you'd never ask.

553
00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:04.233
(gentle guitar music)

554
00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.734
All right. I am blindfolded.

555
00:20:12.867 --> 00:20:14.033
What now?

556
00:20:14.166 --> 00:20:14.967
- Put your hands
in prayer position

557
00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:16.834
and bend your right knee.

558
00:20:16.967 --> 00:20:19.066
Rest your right foot
on your left knee

559
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.000
or on the upper thigh.

560
00:20:21.133 --> 00:20:23.000
And just hold that
as long as you can.

561
00:20:24.166 --> 00:20:25.867
(both chuckling)

562
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.734
- You weren't
kidding. That is hard.

563
00:20:27.867 --> 00:20:29.834
Thanks for showing me. Who knew?

564
00:20:29.967 --> 00:20:32.300
- Glad I could be your
impromptu instructor.

565
00:20:32.433 --> 00:20:33.500
- I haven't seen you around.

566
00:20:33.633 --> 00:20:34.700
Are you new to the crew?

567
00:20:34.834 --> 00:20:35.800
- You could say that. Yes.

568
00:20:35.934 --> 00:20:37.734
- Well. thanks for the pointers.

569
00:20:37.867 --> 00:20:39.533
definitely need to do more yoga.

570
00:20:39.667 --> 00:20:42.000
at least to help me de-stress.

571
00:20:42.133 --> 00:20:43.900
especially before
these eliminations.

572
00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.333
I'm Marco. by the
way. what's your name?

573
00:20:47.467 --> 00:20:49.467
- I'm late...

574
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.467
for something important.

575
00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.233
Bye.

576
00:20:52.367 --> 00:20:52.934
- For real?

577
00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:57.500
It's nice to meet you. too!

578
00:21:03.433 --> 00:21:07.133
(upbeat guitar music)

579
00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:08.533
- Okay. instead of an interview.

580
00:21:08.667 --> 00:21:12.367
let's have more of a
rapid-fire conversation.

581
00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:13.567
Favorite street food?

582
00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:14.600
- Tacos.

583
00:21:14.734 --> 00:21:15.467
- Favorite drink?

584
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:16.533
- Rosé.

585
00:21:16.667 --> 00:21:17.467
- Favorite first date?

586
00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:18.600
- A short one.

587
00:21:19.433 --> 00:21:20.367
- Why is that?

588
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:21.934
- You always have the
option to extend a date

589
00:21:22.066 --> 00:21:22.734
if it's going well.

590
00:21:22.867 --> 00:21:24.066
but if it's not.

591
00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.367
somehow it feels like
time's in slow motion.

592
00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.700
- I can see that.

593
00:21:27.834 --> 00:21:30.300
It sounds like my job
description sometimes.

594
00:21:30.433 --> 00:21:31.467
- Interesting.

595
00:21:34.433 --> 00:21:35.400
So how am I doing right now?

596
00:21:35.533 --> 00:21:37.967
Is this okay or is it
like watching paint dry?

597
00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:40.633
- Hey. now. I ask the
questions around here.

598
00:21:40.767 --> 00:21:41.600
Okay?

599
00:21:41.734 --> 00:21:43.033
- Fine.

600
00:21:43.166 --> 00:21:45.233
- Why did your last
relationship end?

601
00:21:45.367 --> 00:21:47.967
- Apparently I deflect
too much. Why did yours?

602
00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.867
- She didn't like my job.

603
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.967
Hey. now. stop doing that.

604
00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.033
(both chuckling)

605
00:21:55.166 --> 00:21:56.533
Um. okay.

606
00:21:56.667 --> 00:21:58.900
Do you think you're ready
to meet Marco tonight?

607
00:21:59.934 --> 00:22:01.400
- Why else would I be here?

608
00:22:02.266 --> 00:22:03.467
(Luke chuckles)

609
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.800
- Hey Luke.

610
00:22:04.934 --> 00:22:06.834
Emily wants to show you
my latest string out.

611
00:22:06.967 --> 00:22:08.367
- Uh. just tell her
I'm finishing up here.

612
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:09.834
- I think you better come now.

613
00:22:11.767 --> 00:22:14.166
- Sounds serious.
- Excuse me.

614
00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.800
(bright music)

615
00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:21.333
- There's a way I
can win tonight.

616
00:22:21.467 --> 00:22:22.633
I'll wear one of my
best evening gowns.

617
00:22:22.767 --> 00:22:25.166
get my dress noticed
by millions of people

618
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:26.834
and get eliminated and go home.

619
00:22:26.967 --> 00:22:28.533
- Well. what if Marco
gives you a heart?

620
00:22:28.667 --> 00:22:31.266
- He won't. I'll
make sure of it.

621
00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.400
- I told you she had a story.

622
00:22:32.533 --> 00:22:35.100
- Well. it's a rather short
one if she leaves tonight.

623
00:22:35.233 --> 00:22:36.633
- Emily. please. have
a little faith. okay.

624
00:22:36.767 --> 00:22:38.033
She's gonna stick around.

625
00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:40.667
I got this.

626
00:22:42.633 --> 00:22:43.800
- Run it back.
- Sure.

627
00:22:43.934 --> 00:22:47.133
(quirky music)

628
00:22:47.266 --> 00:22:48.233
(camera shuttering)

629
00:22:48.367 --> 00:22:49.600
- We're all set. Thanks.
- Yeah. Is that good?

630
00:22:49.734 --> 00:22:50.934
Okay.

631
00:22:51.066 --> 00:22:52.600
- [Bree] Looking good. Hayley.

632
00:22:52.734 --> 00:22:53.500
- Trying.

633
00:22:53.633 --> 00:22:54.800
(Bree laughs)

634
00:22:54.934 --> 00:22:56.533
- So we've been here
just over an hour

635
00:22:56.667 --> 00:22:58.700
and I already broke
rule number three.

636
00:22:58.834 --> 00:23:00.100
- Which rule is that again?

637
00:23:00.233 --> 00:23:01.266
There's too many. it's
hard to keep track.

638
00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.166
- I met Marco. Alone.

639
00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.500
- You did?

640
00:23:04.633 --> 00:23:05.600
- Well. he thought I was
a crew member on break

641
00:23:05.734 --> 00:23:07.433
and he joined me for yoga.

642
00:23:07.567 --> 00:23:08.900
- You little rule breaker.

643
00:23:09.033 --> 00:23:10.166
- I didn't know it was him.

644
00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.767
I was doing my
blindfolded practice.

645
00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:13.066
- As only you do.

646
00:23:14.166 --> 00:23:15.266
Oh. sorry. Go on.

647
00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.066
- Anyway. Once I realized it
was him. I totally freaked.

648
00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.600
My flowchart went
out the window.

649
00:23:19.734 --> 00:23:21.266
- So what did you do?

650
00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.266
- I ran away.

651
00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.266
- No. you did not.

652
00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.367
- But then I realized

653
00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.233
that was actually the best
thing I could have done.

654
00:23:26.367 --> 00:23:27.867
With all these girls
fawning over him.

655
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.567
playing hard to get could
be the key to winning.

656
00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.567
- There's just one problem...

657
00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:34.600
you don't want to win.

658
00:23:34.734 --> 00:23:37.333
- True. But you
know what I mean?

659
00:23:37.467 --> 00:23:38.867
- So what was he like?

660
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.033
- Mm. a little cocky. but fun.

661
00:23:41.166 --> 00:23:43.333
And even cuter in
person than he is on TV.

662
00:23:43.467 --> 00:23:45.233
- Ladies. you know it's
not nice to talk about me

663
00:23:45.367 --> 00:23:46.433
behind my back.

664
00:23:46.567 --> 00:23:48.433
- It's also not nice to sneak
up on people and scare them.

665
00:23:48.567 --> 00:23:50.667
- Sorry. We have
a schedule change.

666
00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:54.500
We need you two on the patio
with the contestants in...

667
00:23:54.633 --> 00:23:55.667
20 minutes.

668
00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:56.767
- "Pool-side wine tasting."

669
00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:58.934
- Whoa! Whoa. what happened
to the formal dinner?

670
00:23:59.066 --> 00:24:02.500
- Well. it's a lot of effort
to get dressed up every night.

671
00:24:02.633 --> 00:24:03.467
we thought we'd
give y'all a break.

672
00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.000
keep it casual.

673
00:24:05.133 --> 00:24:07.166
- (laughing awkwardly)
That is very sweet of you.

674
00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:10.266
But. um. when will we be getting
dressed up in evening wear?

675
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.367
- Well. with all these
schedule changes.

676
00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:13.900
it looks like you won't be
able to do that until...

677
00:24:14.033 --> 00:24:16.333
Yeah. the finale.

678
00:24:17.533 --> 00:24:19.734
(quirky music)

679
00:24:19.867 --> 00:24:20.700
See you in 20 minutes.

680
00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:22.767
- Uh...

681
00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:23.667
Well.

682
00:24:26.934 --> 00:24:28.567
- (sighs) It's like he
knew what my plan was

683
00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.467
and totally thwarted it.

684
00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:31.667
- We gotta be more careful.

685
00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:32.734
- Careful?

686
00:24:32.867 --> 00:24:35.567
- Those cameras outside.
they must've heard us.

687
00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:38.300
- Great. And now I'm
stuck till the finale.

688
00:24:38.433 --> 00:24:39.633
- Look at it this way.

689
00:24:39.767 --> 00:24:40.633
Every minute you're on-screen

690
00:24:40.767 --> 00:24:43.834
means more eyeballs
on you and your brand.

691
00:24:43.967 --> 00:24:45.500
- Wearing what?

692
00:24:45.633 --> 00:24:48.000
Luke nixed all the evening
wear events till the end.

693
00:24:48.133 --> 00:24:50.667
- "Wine tasting.
pool-side casual."

694
00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.567
Just wear one of
your sun dresses.

695
00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.266
- No. I can do better.

696
00:24:55.467 --> 00:24:56.834
I just need my sewing kit.

697
00:24:57.633 --> 00:25:02.767
(bright music)

698
00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:05.600
music)

699
00:25:19.166 --> 00:25:20.967
- Hey. you're late.

700
00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:21.734
Where's Hayley.

701
00:25:21.867 --> 00:25:23.567
- Uh. she's coming.

702
00:25:28.233 --> 00:25:31.734
- Sorry. it took me a minute
to improvise something.

703
00:25:32.767 --> 00:25:34.133
- Very ambitious.

704
00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:36.600
Okay. let's go. We're rolling.

705
00:25:36.734 --> 00:25:37.500
Come on.

706
00:25:41.233 --> 00:25:42.734
- Well...

707
00:25:42.867 --> 00:25:43.734
they seem nice.

708
00:25:44.867 --> 00:25:47.066
- I'm gonna guess no one
told them we were coming.

709
00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.367
- Also. why are
there four of them?

710
00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:49.500
Weren't there 10 in
the last episode?

711
00:25:49.633 --> 00:25:51.734
- Well. they shot a bunch
of episodes in-between them.

712
00:25:51.867 --> 00:25:53.967
These ladies have been
through the ringer.

713
00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:55.734
- That explains why they're
staring daggers at us.

714
00:25:55.867 --> 00:25:58.400
- More like broadswords.

715
00:25:58.533 --> 00:25:59.800
Should we kill
them with kindness?

716
00:25:59.934 --> 00:26:01.700
- Famous last words.

717
00:26:01.834 --> 00:26:02.767
- Who's gonna take Vanessa.

718
00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:03.834
- Not it.

719
00:26:03.967 --> 00:26:05.300
I'd rather deal with
two Skylars and a Luanne

720
00:26:05.433 --> 00:26:06.367
than deal with her.

721
00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:07.633
- Okay. fine.

722
00:26:07.767 --> 00:26:09.367
I'll take one for the team.

723
00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:10.667
On the plus side.

724
00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:11.934
she's next to the
cheese platter.

725
00:26:12.066 --> 00:26:13.800
I'm starving.
(Hayley laughing)

726
00:26:13.934 --> 00:26:16.367
- All right. Silver
Halo on three.

727
00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:17.700
- Ready? Break.

728
00:26:19.233 --> 00:26:22.400
(gentle guitar music)

729
00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:24.700
- Is this seat taken?

730
00:26:24.834 --> 00:26:25.867
- It is now.

731
00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.100
I'm Luanne.

732
00:26:28.233 --> 00:26:29.700
- I saw the season premiere.

733
00:26:29.834 --> 00:26:32.333
You were so brave
on that zip-line.

734
00:26:32.467 --> 00:26:33.600
- Thanks.

735
00:26:33.734 --> 00:26:35.100
I'm Hayley B. I
just got here today.

736
00:26:35.233 --> 00:26:36.100
- We noticed.

737
00:26:36.233 --> 00:26:38.567
Vanessa warned us. but
I didn't believe it.

738
00:26:39.834 --> 00:26:43.133
So. what are you a fashion
designer or something?

739
00:26:43.266 --> 00:26:44.800
- Actually. Yes.

740
00:26:44.934 --> 00:26:46.400
- That's typical.

741
00:26:49.667 --> 00:26:51.700
- I think I'm gonna go
get some Chardonnay.

742
00:26:51.834 --> 00:26:53.467
- [Luanne] Mm-hmm.

743
00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.800
- Well. well. well. if
it isn't the Skylar's.

744
00:26:58.934 --> 00:27:01.200
(Hayley chuckles)

745
00:27:01.333 --> 00:27:02.233
Yeah.

746
00:27:02.367 --> 00:27:04.100
I'm Hayley. I'm not Skylar.

747
00:27:06.166 --> 00:27:06.800
Okay.

748
00:27:06.934 --> 00:27:09.900
- So. how's it going with Marco?

749
00:27:10.033 --> 00:27:10.934
- Amazing.

750
00:27:11.066 --> 00:27:13.200
We formed a strong
foundation from day one

751
00:27:13.333 --> 00:27:15.233
and we've continued
to build from there.

752
00:27:15.367 --> 00:27:17.000
And the chemistry. well...

753
00:27:17.133 --> 00:27:17.900
you can't fake that.

754
00:27:18.033 --> 00:27:20.600
- That pottery date
was so romantic.

755
00:27:20.734 --> 00:27:22.200
- You've been watching the show?

756
00:27:22.333 --> 00:27:24.200
Do people think that
I'm a front runner?

757
00:27:24.333 --> 00:27:25.900
- You're definitely
a household name.

758
00:27:26.033 --> 00:27:28.734
- (sighs) Who are they painting
as the villain this season?

759
00:27:28.867 --> 00:27:30.767
It's Skylar B. isn't
it. You can tell me.

760
00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.400
(Bree chuckles)

761
00:27:32.533 --> 00:27:33.200
- Hi.

762
00:27:33.333 --> 00:27:34.834
- Vanessa. have you met Hayley?

763
00:27:34.967 --> 00:27:36.233
- Best friends. I take it?

764
00:27:36.367 --> 00:27:37.533
- Since we were 8 years old.

765
00:27:37.667 --> 00:27:39.767
- How cute? Here for each other.

766
00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:41.834
Me. I'm here for Marco.

767
00:27:41.967 --> 00:27:44.266
and I am not leaving
this island without him.

768
00:27:47.567 --> 00:27:49.333
- Uh. and what just happened?

769
00:27:49.467 --> 00:27:51.100
- She's playing the clip game.

770
00:27:52.066 --> 00:27:53.166
Every time she gets a clip.

771
00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:54.400
good or bad.

772
00:27:54.533 --> 00:27:56.100
makes her role bigger.

773
00:27:56.233 --> 00:27:57.700
- So people remember her?

774
00:27:57.834 --> 00:27:59.333
- And she stays on the show.

775
00:27:59.467 --> 00:28:00.300
- Oh.

776
00:28:01.433 --> 00:28:04.166
(quirky music)

777
00:28:05.967 --> 00:28:07.300
- Marco!

778
00:28:07.433 --> 00:28:08.633
Hey. man.

779
00:28:08.767 --> 00:28:10.567
Okay. let's use the
earpiece sparingly.

780
00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:13.400
all right. we don't want
it to sound too canned.

781
00:28:13.533 --> 00:28:14.467
- Are people saying
that it does?

782
00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.667
- No. we always smooth
things out in editing.

783
00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:17.967
it just always sounds better

784
00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:19.066
when it's from the
heart. you know.

785
00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.367
Yours. not mine.

786
00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.600
- I'm sorry. man.
It's muscle memory.

787
00:28:23.734 --> 00:28:25.233
I mean all those years of
my coach on the headset.

788
00:28:25.367 --> 00:28:26.667
calling in the plays.

789
00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.667
and this is a lot
more stressful.

790
00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.934
- Well. we're gonna
mix things up tonight.

791
00:28:31.066 --> 00:28:32.266
So look. I trust you.

792
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.300
Just roll with it. Have fun.

793
00:28:34.433 --> 00:28:36.967
Don't be afraid to
call an audible.

794
00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:38.100
- Are you sure?

795
00:28:38.233 --> 00:28:40.066
'Cause Keith always said to
just say what she told me.

796
00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.000
- Well. Keith
isn't here anymore.

797
00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:44.867
You'll be great.

798
00:28:49.033 --> 00:28:51.467
(gentle music)

799
00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.467
(bright music)

800
00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.800
- And now it's time
for the King of Hearts

801
00:28:54.934 --> 00:28:56.767
to meet some new faces.

802
00:28:58.467 --> 00:29:01.033
(bright music)

803
00:29:11.367 --> 00:29:14.100
- Hi.
- Hi. (laughs)

804
00:29:15.834 --> 00:29:19.300
- Bree. it feels like
we've met before.

805
00:29:19.433 --> 00:29:20.834
- I know what you mean.

806
00:29:20.967 --> 00:29:21.600
- Where would it have been?

807
00:29:21.734 --> 00:29:25.066
A concert or a coffee shop...

808
00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:25.834
A yoga class?

809
00:29:25.967 --> 00:29:27.066
- If you keep me around awhile

810
00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.000
I'm sure we'll figure it out.

811
00:29:30.667 --> 00:29:32.533
- So I hear that
you're a risk assessor

812
00:29:32.667 --> 00:29:34.033
for a large insurance firm.

813
00:29:35.166 --> 00:29:36.467
What's that like?

814
00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.967
- A matter of life and death.

815
00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:40.166
(both laughing)

816
00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:41.834
- I like a girl with
a good sense of humor.

817
00:29:41.967 --> 00:29:43.567
- I like a guy
with a great laugh.

818
00:29:44.667 --> 00:29:45.967
- Fill in the blank.

819
00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:46.967
- Okay.

820
00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.800
- I don't want to leave
this island without-

821
00:29:48.934 --> 00:29:50.400
- Seeing a rainbow.

822
00:29:50.533 --> 00:29:51.734
- Wait. you've never
seen a rainbow?

823
00:29:51.867 --> 00:29:52.967
- Not a Hawaiian rainbow.

824
00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:54.367
- What's the difference?

825
00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.467
- They're supposed
to be magical.

826
00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:59.033
I mean. this is the
rainbow state after all.

827
00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.066
- I'll keep my eyes
peeled for you.

828
00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.200
- Thank you.

829
00:30:04.934 --> 00:30:06.433
- Last question.
- Okay.

830
00:30:08.667 --> 00:30:10.934
- Describe your
perfect first date?

831
00:30:12.266 --> 00:30:14.400
- Something relaxed but active.

832
00:30:14.533 --> 00:30:17.066
Chill. but also challenging.

833
00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:20.066
Have you ever heard
of blindfolded yoga?

834
00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.333
- I'll have to check it out.

835
00:30:22.467 --> 00:30:25.000
(chuckles) Well. I'm
really looking forward

836
00:30:25.133 --> 00:30:26.233
to getting to know
you more. Bree.

837
00:30:26.367 --> 00:30:27.166
- Me. too.

838
00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:33.967
- Was that all him?

839
00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:35.000
- Every word.

840
00:30:35.133 --> 00:30:36.033
- Way to go. Marco.

841
00:30:36.166 --> 00:30:37.567
- Might not need that
earpiece after all.

842
00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:39.900
- Right. Go for Marie.

843
00:30:40.033 --> 00:30:41.700
- Why does he need an ear piece?

844
00:30:41.834 --> 00:30:42.600
- You scared me.

845
00:30:43.934 --> 00:30:45.133
- Well. now you
know how it feels.

846
00:30:45.266 --> 00:30:46.834
But seriously. is he
wearing an earpiece?

847
00:30:46.967 --> 00:30:48.567
- It's just precautionary.

848
00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:51.033
- Are you feeding him his lines?

849
00:30:51.166 --> 00:30:52.233
- No!

850
00:30:52.367 --> 00:30:56.033
Sometimes we like to give a.
you know. a romantic assist.

851
00:30:56.166 --> 00:30:56.934
That's all.

852
00:30:57.066 --> 00:30:59.867
- If only dating
was a team sport.

853
00:31:00.066 --> 00:31:02.033
- Well around here.
it kind of is.

854
00:31:02.166 --> 00:31:04.567
- Anybody got eyes on Hayley B?

855
00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:06.266
- Five. four. three-

856
00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.233
- What?

857
00:31:07.367 --> 00:31:08.467
- What are you doing back here?

858
00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.567
Talent is not allowed
in video village.

859
00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:11.767
- Oh. you called me Talent.

860
00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:12.867
I thought my name was Curious.

861
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.433
- I don't care what your
name is. Get out of here.

862
00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:19.467
- So how do I know if I'm
talking to you or him out there?

863
00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.200
- Ooh. you don't.

864
00:31:21.333 --> 00:31:22.133
- Time is money!

865
00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:33.300
(bright music)

866
00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.233
- Marco. Hi.
- Hi.

867
00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:40.934
- So nice to meet you.

868
00:31:41.066 --> 00:31:41.834
- You too.

869
00:31:41.967 --> 00:31:44.033
- Ask her where
she got the dress.

870
00:31:44.166 --> 00:31:45.567
- Where'd you get your dress?

871
00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:49.133
- Oh. I actually made it
myself this afternoon.

872
00:31:49.266 --> 00:31:51.433
- Amazing. How long did it take?

873
00:31:51.567 --> 00:31:53.133
- How long did it take you?

874
00:31:53.266 --> 00:31:55.700
- About 27 minutes.

875
00:31:55.834 --> 00:31:56.767
I had something else planned.

876
00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.500
but you know. had to make
a game-time decision.

877
00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.333
- Well. you look
absolutely stunning.

878
00:32:03.467 --> 00:32:06.700
- Well. you look
absolutely stunning.

879
00:32:06.834 --> 00:32:08.333
- Let's just say
you inspired me.

880
00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:13.066
(soft guitar music)

881
00:32:19.133 --> 00:32:19.934
- Marie. do you copy?

882
00:32:20.066 --> 00:32:21.500
- [Marie] Go for Marie.

883
00:32:21.633 --> 00:32:23.233
- Over to channel two. please.

884
00:32:27.266 --> 00:32:28.633
- Hey.
- Hey. don't look at me.

885
00:32:28.767 --> 00:32:31.200
these are the names Emily
gave over the walkie.

886
00:32:32.166 --> 00:32:34.633
- (sighs) You sure
you heard it right?

887
00:32:35.567 --> 00:32:38.000
- Well. it was a lot of static.

888
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.166
Luke. whatever you're doing.

889
00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:43.066
I didn't see it.

890
00:32:45.467 --> 00:32:46.300
- Thank you.

891
00:32:55.834 --> 00:32:59.166
sic)

892
00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.166
- And now this adventure
will come to an end

893
00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.567
for three of these
lovely ladies.

894
00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:06.433
Marco. are you ready to
make some heart choices?

895
00:33:06.567 --> 00:33:07.834
- Here we go.

896
00:33:07.967 --> 00:33:10.533
(dramatic music)

897
00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:16.367
Vanessa...

898
00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:18.200
would you step forward?

899
00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:24.100
No one can deny that
you're your own woman.

900
00:33:24.233 --> 00:33:25.800
(Vanessa chuckles)

901
00:33:25.934 --> 00:33:26.734
And every time I see you.

902
00:33:26.867 --> 00:33:28.266
I can't help but wonder...

903
00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:29.333
what's gonna happen next.

904
00:33:29.467 --> 00:33:31.100
(Hayley chuckles)

905
00:33:31.233 --> 00:33:33.300
Will you accept this heart?

906
00:33:33.433 --> 00:33:34.100
- Of. course.

907
00:33:34.233 --> 00:33:37.633
(Vanessa chuckles)

908
00:33:37.767 --> 00:33:40.467
(dramatic music)

909
00:33:48.367 --> 00:33:49.166
- Bree...

910
00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:50.433
will you step forward?

911
00:33:55.467 --> 00:33:57.300
I know I just barely met you.

912
00:33:57.433 --> 00:33:59.934
but somehow I feel like
we've always known each other

913
00:34:00.133 --> 00:34:02.867
and I'd hate for you to
not see that rainbow.

914
00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.300
Will you accept this heart?

915
00:34:07.433 --> 00:34:08.100
- I...

916
00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:10.467
Yes.

917
00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.800
(both giggling)

918
00:34:13.934 --> 00:34:16.600
(dramatic music)

919
00:34:23.467 --> 00:34:24.233
- Luanne...

920
00:34:24.367 --> 00:34:26.533
would you step forward?

921
00:34:30.133 --> 00:34:33.233
Your knowledge of
astrology is...

922
00:34:33.367 --> 00:34:34.367
well. astronomical.

923
00:34:36.467 --> 00:34:38.467
I always knew that
I was a Cancer.

924
00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.400
but without you I
never would have known

925
00:34:40.533 --> 00:34:42.700
that my moon was in Virgo.

926
00:34:42.834 --> 00:34:45.500
Let alone the fact that
my Venus was in Gemini.

927
00:34:45.633 --> 00:34:48.033
(Luanne chuckles)

928
00:34:48.166 --> 00:34:51.467
Ironically. the more you
taught me about my chart.

929
00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:55.033
the more I realized that our
stars don't actually align.

930
00:34:56.467 --> 00:34:58.800
I may have never realized
that without you.

931
00:34:58.934 --> 00:35:00.467
So. thank you.

932
00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:01.433
- You're welcome.

933
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.467
- Unfortunately. I don't
have a heart for you tonight.

934
00:35:07.567 --> 00:35:10.166
(dramatic music)

935
00:35:16.834 --> 00:35:17.600
Hayley...

936
00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:19.934
can you step forward?

937
00:35:26.333 --> 00:35:29.200
You're smart. ambitious.

938
00:35:29.333 --> 00:35:31.467
word on the street is
you're also very curious.

939
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.633
I haven't been able to spend
much time with you yet.

940
00:35:34.767 --> 00:35:39.600
so I'm curious to find out
who the real Hayley is.

941
00:35:41.433 --> 00:35:43.300
Will you accept this heart?

942
00:35:43.433 --> 00:35:46.400
(dramatic music)

943
00:35:47.533 --> 00:35:48.767
- Marco I'd...

944
00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.433
love for you to get
to know the real me.

945
00:35:53.567 --> 00:35:55.900
but in order for that to happen.

946
00:35:56.033 --> 00:35:57.367
this needs to go both ways.

947
00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:00.967
You can't be the only
one asking the questions.

948
00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:04.767
Relationships are
based on trust.

949
00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:06.166
If you want me to
be open with you.

950
00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:07.967
I need you to be
open with me. too.

951
00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:10.066
Is that fair?

952
00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:12.667
- Absolutely.

953
00:36:14.133 --> 00:36:17.033
(Hayley chuckles)

954
00:36:19.734 --> 00:36:21.200
- You did it.

955
00:36:21.333 --> 00:36:24.100
We made it through our
first heart ceremony.

956
00:36:24.233 --> 00:36:25.467
- Thanks. I think.

957
00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:28.600
- I can't believe
I'm holding an actual

958
00:36:28.734 --> 00:36:32.367
"Heart Choice's" ceremonial
heart with my name on it.

959
00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:34.266
I can't wait to show
the girls my bracket.

960
00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.533
they're gonna freak.

961
00:36:37.233 --> 00:36:39.533
Wait. what happened to yours?

962
00:36:46.333 --> 00:36:48.700
- I think I have a
pretty good theory.

963
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.800
- Let me guess another
one of your gut feelings.

964
00:36:53.934 --> 00:36:55.100
- Isn't that why you hired me?

965
00:36:55.233 --> 00:36:56.133
- Surprises are
for the audience.

966
00:36:56.266 --> 00:36:57.467
not the host. Luke.

967
00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.533
- Look. Luanne has had
five episodes to pop.

968
00:36:59.667 --> 00:37:01.200
Her story was played out.

969
00:37:01.333 --> 00:37:03.900
I had a hunch that Hayley
would deliver tonight

970
00:37:04.033 --> 00:37:05.333
so I changed the play.

971
00:37:05.467 --> 00:37:07.500
Honestly. I think Marco
was really intrigued

972
00:37:07.633 --> 00:37:08.433
by her response.

973
00:37:08.567 --> 00:37:09.900
- You sure he's the
one who's intrigued?

974
00:37:10.033 --> 00:37:12.266
- Look. you hired
me to run this show.

975
00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:13.934
You have to trust me.

976
00:37:14.066 --> 00:37:15.533
- Okay.

977
00:37:15.667 --> 00:37:18.000
But if at any point I feel
like things are slipping away.

978
00:37:18.133 --> 00:37:19.500
I will snatch that
golden headset from you

979
00:37:19.633 --> 00:37:20.500
as quick as I gave it.

980
00:37:20.633 --> 00:37:21.600
Understand.

981
00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:26.300
- Loud and clear.

982
00:37:27.233 --> 00:37:29.100
- A romantic assist.

983
00:37:29.233 --> 00:37:30.433
Gross.

984
00:37:30.567 --> 00:37:31.367
- Luke said it's
not all the time.

985
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.367
but Marco definitely
wears an earpiece

986
00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:35.000
during the elimination ceremony.

987
00:37:35.133 --> 00:37:36.934
You can see it if
you look close.

988
00:37:37.066 --> 00:37:38.400
- That's crazy.

989
00:37:38.533 --> 00:37:40.000
For a minute it felt so organic.

990
00:37:40.133 --> 00:37:42.433
It almost felt real.

991
00:37:42.567 --> 00:37:43.367
- To be fair.

992
00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:44.367
I did hear him tell Marie

993
00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:45.767
that he specifically
was not coaching Marco

994
00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:47.567
during your meet and greet.

995
00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.200
but there were times
during mine when I swear

996
00:37:49.333 --> 00:37:51.867
Luke was talking directly to me.

997
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.867
- Interesting.

998
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.667
Well. at least we know
what we're dealing with.

999
00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:57.734
Speaking of.

1000
00:37:57.867 --> 00:38:00.433
we should go over the
next phase of the plan.

1001
00:38:00.567 --> 00:38:02.467
Tomorrow. if it's a group date.

1002
00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:03.433
let Vanessa drive the train.

1003
00:38:03.567 --> 00:38:05.467
- Drive the train
or the train wreck?

1004
00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:06.467
- Exactly.

1005
00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:07.367
Let her go down in flames.

1006
00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:10.000
And we look like
the better choice.

1007
00:38:10.133 --> 00:38:11.066
If it's a one-on-one.

1008
00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.633
play the ambivalent card harder.

1009
00:38:12.767 --> 00:38:13.834
make Marco work for it.

1010
00:38:13.967 --> 00:38:15.100
- And if it's a double?

1011
00:38:15.233 --> 00:38:16.500
- That's where
things get tricky.

1012
00:38:16.633 --> 00:38:18.266
- (sighs) I'm really
struggling. Bree.

1013
00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:19.600
The more I think about it.

1014
00:38:19.734 --> 00:38:20.533
I feel like Luke's
wardrobe curveball

1015
00:38:20.667 --> 00:38:22.734
may have put us in a
lose-lose situation.

1016
00:38:22.867 --> 00:38:23.667
- What do you mean?

1017
00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:24.967
- Say everything
goes to plan. right?

1018
00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:26.266
Vanessa gets eliminated.

1019
00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.367
We both make it to
the final ceremony.

1020
00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:30.400
We look stunning in our
Silver Halo evening wear-

1021
00:38:30.533 --> 00:38:32.333
- Sounds pretty great so far.

1022
00:38:32.467 --> 00:38:35.500
- Until he gives
out the final heart.

1023
00:38:35.633 --> 00:38:36.667
Neither of us wants to win.

1024
00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.667
but inevitably he is going
to give one of us the heart.

1025
00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.400
We can't both be second place.

1026
00:38:40.533 --> 00:38:42.567
- Shoot. You're right.

1027
00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:45.333
And I definitely don't have a
flow chart for that scenario.

1028
00:38:45.467 --> 00:38:46.266
- What do we do?

1029
00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:48.633
- I don't know yet.

1030
00:38:48.767 --> 00:38:49.934
We'll figure it out.

1031
00:38:50.066 --> 00:38:52.266
And whatever it is.
we do it together.

1032
00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:53.200
- There's nobody on earth

1033
00:38:53.333 --> 00:38:55.333
I'd rather face
nationally broadcasted

1034
00:38:55.467 --> 00:38:56.900
primetime humiliation with.

1035
00:38:57.033 --> 00:38:58.967
- That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

1036
00:38:59.100 --> 00:38:59.934
- Hmm.

1037
00:39:00.133 --> 00:39:02.967
(knock on door)

1038
00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:03.867
What's that?

1039
00:39:04.934 --> 00:39:05.867
"Nice work. H.

1040
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:06.800
Could be nicer.

1041
00:39:06.934 --> 00:39:08.533
Meet me in the garden
to find out how.

1042
00:39:08.667 --> 00:39:11.233
Come alone or not at all."

1043
00:39:11.367 --> 00:39:12.467
No signature.

1044
00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:14.567
- Not official show stationary.

1045
00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:16.967
This is black ops or
a trap or something.

1046
00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:17.867
You shouldn't go.

1047
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.166
I wouldn't if I were you.

1048
00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:23.333
- Yeah. but your
nickname isn't Curious.

1049
00:39:26.834 --> 00:39:27.567
Hello?

1050
00:39:30.333 --> 00:39:31.100
Hello?

1051
00:39:32.934 --> 00:39:34.133
Okay. Good one.

1052
00:39:34.266 --> 00:39:34.900
You got me.

1053
00:39:35.033 --> 00:39:36.700
Although I'm a very easy mark.

1054
00:39:36.834 --> 00:39:39.633
so don't be too
proud of yourself.

1055
00:39:39.767 --> 00:39:41.834
- You don't give
yourself enough credit.

1056
00:39:41.967 --> 00:39:43.900
Even I underestimated you.

1057
00:39:44.033 --> 00:39:46.367
Challenging Marco with
that speech about trust

1058
00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:47.700
was a pro-level move.

1059
00:39:47.834 --> 00:39:49.967
Brava. my dear. Brava.

1060
00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:51.000
- Vanessa. we shouldn't be-

1061
00:39:51.133 --> 00:39:52.166
- No need to whisper.

1062
00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:53.967
the fountain
scrambles the audio.

1063
00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:56.500
Why else would there
be a no fountains rule?

1064
00:39:56.633 --> 00:39:59.734
This is the only place us
girls can tell secrets.

1065
00:39:59.867 --> 00:40:01.967
I'd like to propose
a partnership-

1066
00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:04.233
- With me?
- As arch rivals. of course.

1067
00:40:04.367 --> 00:40:06.667
If we up the ante together.

1068
00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:08.233
we could send the
ratings through the roof.

1069
00:40:08.367 --> 00:40:09.667
- Define upping the ante?

1070
00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:10.734
- Don't be coy.

1071
00:40:10.867 --> 00:40:12.633
You know exactly what I mean.

1072
00:40:12.767 --> 00:40:15.333
The nice girl persona
will only get you so far.

1073
00:40:15.467 --> 00:40:16.567
If you want to
make an impression.

1074
00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:18.367
you need to show some edge.

1075
00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:19.600
Throw a tantrum.

1076
00:40:19.734 --> 00:40:22.166
lock yourself in your bathroom
and refuse to come out.

1077
00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:23.367
Toss wine in my face.

1078
00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:24.300
(Hayley laughs)

1079
00:40:24.433 --> 00:40:26.633
What? You don't think
I could take it?

1080
00:40:26.767 --> 00:40:27.900
- Oh. no. no. it's not that.

1081
00:40:28.033 --> 00:40:29.333
- You think that
I can dish it out.

1082
00:40:29.467 --> 00:40:31.367
but I'm too prissy to
get my hands dirty.

1083
00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:32.133
- I assure you.
that's not what I-

1084
00:40:32.266 --> 00:40:33.700
- Throw your wine in my face.

1085
00:40:33.834 --> 00:40:35.633
- I'm not going to do that.
- Oh. come on.

1086
00:40:35.767 --> 00:40:37.000
It's a safe space.

1087
00:40:37.133 --> 00:40:39.066
No cameras. no Marco.

1088
00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:42.000
Give it a go. Let me prove
it that I mean business.

1089
00:40:42.133 --> 00:40:43.066
Do it!

1090
00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:46.333
- Eh!
(drink splashing)

1091
00:40:46.467 --> 00:40:49.834
- Hmm. not bad
for your first go.

1092
00:40:49.967 --> 00:40:51.633
Next time keep your eyes open

1093
00:40:51.767 --> 00:40:52.700
and make sure to follow through.

1094
00:40:52.834 --> 00:40:55.300
- Uh!
(drink splashing)

1095
00:40:55.433 --> 00:40:56.633
- Think about my offer.

1096
00:40:56.767 --> 00:40:58.800
It won't last much longer.

1097
00:40:58.934 --> 00:41:00.367
You know where to find me?

1098
00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:01.233
- Yep.

1099
00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:03.233
Yeah.

1100
00:41:15.934 --> 00:41:17.433
- Should I be sad that Vanessa

1101
00:41:17.567 --> 00:41:19.667
didn't want to form
an alliance with me?

1102
00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.767
- (chuckles) Go ahead.
She's all yours.

1103
00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:22.834
She probably thinks
you're a threat

1104
00:41:22.967 --> 00:41:24.934
if she thinks she needs
help taking you down.

1105
00:41:25.066 --> 00:41:26.700
- Look at you figuring
out the strategy.

1106
00:41:26.834 --> 00:41:28.133
- (laughs) I learned
from the best.

1107
00:41:28.266 --> 00:41:30.100
- You mean me or Vanessa?

1108
00:41:30.233 --> 00:41:33.000
- Oh. now I guess both.

1109
00:41:33.133 --> 00:41:35.533
By the way. did you see her
name wasn't on the call sheet

1110
00:41:35.667 --> 00:41:36.834
for the group date.

1111
00:41:36.967 --> 00:41:38.300
She's gonna be so
mad she missed out.

1112
00:41:38.433 --> 00:41:40.100
- They must be playing
up the drama of...

1113
00:41:40.233 --> 00:41:43.000
"Two best friends buying
for the same man."

1114
00:41:43.133 --> 00:41:44.133
- Que dramatic drumbeat.

1115
00:41:44.266 --> 00:41:45.533
- (laughs) Little do they know.

1116
00:41:45.667 --> 00:41:47.166
we are the ones playing them.

1117
00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:48.066
- Dun. dun. dun!

1118
00:41:49.834 --> 00:41:50.934
- Okay. cowgirls.

1119
00:41:51.066 --> 00:41:53.834
I hope you like horses because
it's time to saddle up.

1120
00:41:53.967 --> 00:41:55.500
- I love horses.

1121
00:41:55.633 --> 00:41:56.867
I grew up with them.

1122
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.834
- And I'm deathly
allergic to them.

1123
00:41:58.967 --> 00:41:59.967
- Oh.

1124
00:42:00.166 --> 00:42:02.367
A police horse nuzzled her
at a parade in fifth grade.

1125
00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:04.500
She had to go to the ER.

1126
00:42:04.633 --> 00:42:06.033
- And you're just
telling me this now?

1127
00:42:06.166 --> 00:42:08.867
What did you think a
10:00 AM ride meant?

1128
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.400
- Mountain biking?
(horse neighing)

1129
00:42:11.533 --> 00:42:14.767
(quirky music)
(Bree awkwardly chuckles)

1130
00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:16.333
- We have an issue.

1131
00:42:16.467 --> 00:42:19.734
Hayley is severely
allergic to horses.

1132
00:42:19.867 --> 00:42:23.533
- (scoffs) Well. there goes
our double date dramatics.

1133
00:42:23.667 --> 00:42:24.834
- Oh. yeah. Too bad.

1134
00:42:24.967 --> 00:42:27.834
So that's an early
wrap then. huh?

1135
00:42:27.967 --> 00:42:29.100
- Yeah. Nice try.

1136
00:42:29.233 --> 00:42:30.367
No. we'll just have to. uh...

1137
00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:31.667
we'll have to
divide and conquer.

1138
00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:32.867
- I don't have the
crew or the gear

1139
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.767
to run two separate units.

1140
00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:36.066
- Right.

1141
00:42:37.367 --> 00:42:39.100
Okay. well I'll run camera here.

1142
00:42:39.233 --> 00:42:40.734
continue my interview
with Hayley.

1143
00:42:40.867 --> 00:42:44.100
And you. you can direct the
main unit with Bree and Marco.

1144
00:42:45.967 --> 00:42:47.367
What's the matter?

1145
00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.100
You worried you won't be
able to fill my cowboy boots?

1146
00:42:49.233 --> 00:42:51.266
- I'm worried you're gonna
leave the lens cap on.

1147
00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:52.734
- Ouch.

1148
00:42:52.867 --> 00:42:54.900
I may be rusty. but it
hasn't been that long.

1149
00:42:55.033 --> 00:42:58.500
- How about I do the
interview with Hayley

1150
00:42:58.633 --> 00:43:00.433
so you can stay with first team?

1151
00:43:00.567 --> 00:43:03.834
Unless you have a preference.

1152
00:43:03.967 --> 00:43:05.567
- Why?

1153
00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:07.000
What does it seem like I do?

1154
00:43:07.133 --> 00:43:09.000
- Guess we'll tune in
next week to find out.

1155
00:43:13.233 --> 00:43:14.400
We all set cameras?

1156
00:43:14.533 --> 00:43:15.967
All right. let's do this.

1157
00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:17.033
When I call action.

1158
00:43:17.166 --> 00:43:19.834
you're gonna walk the horse
and slowly towards me.

1159
00:43:19.967 --> 00:43:22.166
then look back at Bree like
you're infatuated with her

1160
00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:23.934
and then Bree you do the same.

1161
00:43:24.066 --> 00:43:26.100
then we'll reset
till we get it right!

1162
00:43:26.233 --> 00:43:27.433
- That was a lot of information.

1163
00:43:27.567 --> 00:43:29.000
Did you get all that?

1164
00:43:29.133 --> 00:43:30.967
- They have a very specific way
of doing things around here.

1165
00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:33.066
It can be really annoying.

1166
00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:33.900
- I don't get it.

1167
00:43:34.033 --> 00:43:35.467
You're the star.

1168
00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:37.433
Why don't you just tell
them you want to improvise?

1169
00:43:37.567 --> 00:43:39.000
- Because every time
I try they yell.

1170
00:43:39.133 --> 00:43:40.300
"Quiet on the set!"

1171
00:43:40.433 --> 00:43:41.233
- Well. maybe if you just-

1172
00:43:41.367 --> 00:43:43.333
- [Marie] Quiet on the set!

1173
00:43:43.467 --> 00:43:44.500
- Told you.

1174
00:43:44.633 --> 00:43:47.000
- Hold the roll.
we're reloading.

1175
00:43:47.133 --> 00:43:47.967
- Honestly. I'm
pretty used to it.

1176
00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:49.467
- What do you mean?

1177
00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:50.767
Ever since the peewee leagues

1178
00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:51.900
I've always had a
coach in my ear.

1179
00:43:52.033 --> 00:43:55.467
And then in the pros. I
got a physical trainer.

1180
00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:58.900
diet consultant. a
financial planner.

1181
00:43:59.033 --> 00:44:00.300
The list goes on and on.

1182
00:44:00.433 --> 00:44:01.467
It gets to the point
you don't do anything

1183
00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:03.133
without asking someone first.

1184
00:44:03.266 --> 00:44:05.633
- Maybe it's time
to call a reverse.

1185
00:44:05.767 --> 00:44:07.300
- Oh. just gallop off
in the other direction.

1186
00:44:07.433 --> 00:44:08.567
never let them catch me?

1187
00:44:10.467 --> 00:44:11.633
I grew up in Downtown Columbus.

1188
00:44:11.767 --> 00:44:13.800
I have never
galloped in my life.

1189
00:44:13.934 --> 00:44:17.266
- Do you trust me?
(horse neighing)

1190
00:44:19.333 --> 00:44:22.033
(bright music)

1191
00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:28.667
- Oscar!

1192
00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.633
Get me my golf cart. now!

1193
00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:37.800

far away from me ♪

1194
00:44:37.934 --> 00:44:41.567

(energetic music)

1200
00:45:01.166 --> 00:45:03.266
- [Hayley] Okay. but.
um. more importantly.

1201
00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:07.033
I do think we need to talk
about your dating life.

1202
00:45:07.166 --> 00:45:08.567
- Oh. my dating life. Okay.
- Yes.

1203
00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:10.200
- [Hayley] What's your M.O.?

1204
00:45:10.333 --> 00:45:11.200
Do you like to be friends first?

1205
00:45:11.333 --> 00:45:12.867
- Ha-ha!

1206
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.133
You know. I don't
believe in M.Os.

1207
00:45:14.266 --> 00:45:15.633
I think if you got
something good.

1208
00:45:15.767 --> 00:45:18.934
then friendship goes in the
back burner pretty fast.

1209
00:45:19.066 --> 00:45:20.100
- Okay. Okay.

1210
00:45:20.233 --> 00:45:21.066
Keep going.

1211
00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:21.967
Ideal woman.

1212
00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:23.300
- Ideal woman.

1213
00:45:24.333 --> 00:45:26.567
I don't know how to
describe her per se.

1214
00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:30.100
All I know is when I
meet her. I'll feel it.

1215
00:45:30.233 --> 00:45:31.934
Okay. What about you?

1216
00:45:32.066 --> 00:45:35.367
Describe for me
Hayley B's ideal man.

1217
00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:36.100
- Okay.

1218
00:45:37.667 --> 00:45:40.867
Well. he makes me laugh and...

1219
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.133
he's there when I cry.

1220
00:45:42.266 --> 00:45:43.266
He's passionate.

1221
00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:44.600
He's not threatened by a partner

1222
00:45:44.734 --> 00:45:46.934
who wants something
more in life as well.

1223
00:45:47.867 --> 00:45:49.333
And most importantly. he...

1224
00:45:50.266 --> 00:45:51.767
has his priorities straight.

1225
00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:53.834
He'd moved mountains to
make sure we're together.

1226
00:45:56.333 --> 00:45:58.200
What? You don't like my answer?

1227
00:45:58.333 --> 00:45:59.433
- I can work with that.

1228
00:46:02.467 --> 00:46:04.800
- So when is the real
interview gonna start?

1229
00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:08.300
- That's the beauty. it's done.

1230
00:46:08.433 --> 00:46:09.533
- What?

1231
00:46:09.667 --> 00:46:12.100
But where were those
loaded questions

1232
00:46:12.233 --> 00:46:15.033
and clever turns of
phrase you're so fond of?

1233
00:46:15.166 --> 00:46:16.033
- I have a list in my notebook.

1234
00:46:16.166 --> 00:46:17.100
if you want me to get it out.

1235
00:46:17.233 --> 00:46:19.967
- No. no. you don't need
to grab your notebook.

1236
00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:21.166
This is much more...

1237
00:46:22.333 --> 00:46:23.367
open.

1238
00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:26.967
- Thanks for the reminder
at the ceremony last night.

1239
00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:28.200
I really needed it.

1240
00:46:28.333 --> 00:46:29.834
- You're welcome.

1241
00:46:29.967 --> 00:46:31.600
- Made me think about why
I got into this business

1242
00:46:31.734 --> 00:46:33.033
in the first place.

1243
00:46:33.166 --> 00:46:36.033
I mean. not reality TV.
but just filmmaking.

1244
00:46:36.166 --> 00:46:37.867
Documentaries specifically.

1245
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.100
That's what I studied
in college. at least.

1246
00:46:40.233 --> 00:46:41.934
- And now you're doing this?

1247
00:46:42.066 --> 00:46:42.767
- I know.

1248
00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:44.033
(laughs) I know.

1249
00:46:44.166 --> 00:46:46.200
I've turned to the
dark side. I get it.

1250
00:46:47.266 --> 00:46:49.967
But in a way you did too. right?

1251
00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:52.033
- I don't want to talk about it.

1252
00:46:52.166 --> 00:46:54.033
- Well. good because I
already packed the camera

1253
00:46:54.166 --> 00:46:54.967
and everything up.

1254
00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:56.500
so I'm not getting
all that back out.

1255
00:46:56.633 --> 00:46:58.333
(Hayley laughing)

1256
00:46:58.467 --> 00:46:59.633
- I would hate

1257
00:46:59.767 --> 00:47:00.433
to inconvenience you.
- Yeah. no. come on.

1258
00:47:00.567 --> 00:47:02.367
I'm done for the day.

1259
00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:05.400
(romantic music)

1260
00:47:08.133 --> 00:47:09.166
- [Bree] I learned
something new today.

1261
00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:10.400
- [Marco] What's that?

1262
00:47:10.533 --> 00:47:12.233
- Horses are faster
than golf carts.

1263
00:47:12.367 --> 00:47:14.400
(both laughing)

1264
00:47:14.533 --> 00:47:16.767
- I am never gonna hear
the end of this from Marie.

1265
00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:19.333
but it's so worth it.

1266
00:47:19.467 --> 00:47:22.367
Ah. it's so nice to not
have a camera in my face.

1267
00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:24.100
- Which kind of
begs the question.

1268
00:47:24.233 --> 00:47:25.567
Why did you come
on a reality show?

1269
00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:27.533
- What. you didn't buy my line?

1270
00:47:27.667 --> 00:47:30.400
It's a journey I've never
been more ready to take.

1271
00:47:31.633 --> 00:47:33.900
- I swear every King of
Hearts has said that same line

1272
00:47:34.033 --> 00:47:35.033
since season one.

1273
00:47:35.166 --> 00:47:37.266
- Oh. so you do watch the show?

1274
00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:38.567
- Like when I have time.

1275
00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:41.233
(both laughing)

1276
00:47:41.367 --> 00:47:42.900
- When I blew out my knee.

1277
00:47:43.033 --> 00:47:46.166
I knew that football wasn't
in the cards for me anymore.

1278
00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:48.834
My agent thought it would
be a good idea to do it.

1279
00:47:48.967 --> 00:47:51.233
to keep me in the
spotlight. he said.

1280
00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:54.834
I know how that sounds.
but I'm just being honest.

1281
00:47:54.967 --> 00:47:57.266
I was worried that people
would forget about me.

1282
00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:59.033
- You were all pro in
your rookie season.

1283
00:47:59.166 --> 00:48:01.500
I don't think you have
to worry about that.

1284
00:48:01.633 --> 00:48:03.433
- So. you're a sports fan. too?

1285
00:48:04.734 --> 00:48:05.533
- I dabble.

1286
00:48:07.934 --> 00:48:09.934
- All Right. What about you?

1287
00:48:10.066 --> 00:48:11.100
You seem like a deep person.

1288
00:48:11.233 --> 00:48:14.467
why would you go on a
notoriously shallow dating show?

1289
00:48:15.433 --> 00:48:18.333
(Hayley chuckles)

1290
00:48:18.467 --> 00:48:19.467
- Wait. do you see that?

1291
00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:20.767
- [Marco] What?

1292
00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:22.066
- It looks like it's
raining over there

1293
00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:24.400
and it's still sunny over here.

1294
00:48:24.533 --> 00:48:27.133
- Right. You're
on rainbow watch.

1295
00:48:27.266 --> 00:48:28.633
- Do you see one?

1296
00:48:30.133 --> 00:48:31.333
- Maybe it's one of those
things you can't find

1297
00:48:31.467 --> 00:48:33.200
until you stop looking for it.

1298
00:48:34.633 --> 00:48:36.166
- Maybe you're right.

1299
00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:39.000
(romantic music)

1300
00:48:40.233 --> 00:48:41.834
We should probably
start heading back.

1301
00:48:43.433 --> 00:48:44.800
- Just a few more minutes.

1302
00:48:47.033 --> 00:48:47.800
- Okay. fine.

1303
00:49:04.567 --> 00:49:06.033
- You could have killed
the King of Hearts.

1304
00:49:06.166 --> 00:49:07.233
What were you thinking?

1305
00:49:07.367 --> 00:49:08.433
- He said he'd
never ridden before.

1306
00:49:08.567 --> 00:49:09.934
but he was fine.

1307
00:49:10.066 --> 00:49:11.867
A total natural.

1308
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.200
We found the best view
and just sat and talked.

1309
00:49:15.333 --> 00:49:16.367
Still didn't see
a rainbow though.

1310
00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:17.600
- I have faith in you.

1311
00:49:19.433 --> 00:49:21.300
- This is gonna
sound really cliche

1312
00:49:21.433 --> 00:49:22.367
given the circumstances.

1313
00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:26.400
But. I actually feel a
real connection with him.

1314
00:49:26.533 --> 00:49:27.934
- Interesting.

1315
00:49:28.066 --> 00:49:29.934
- He really opened
up to me today.

1316
00:49:30.066 --> 00:49:32.533
It was refreshing to see
a guy be so vulnerable.

1317
00:49:32.667 --> 00:49:33.633
It caught me off guard.

1318
00:49:33.767 --> 00:49:36.367
- This is so meta right
now. it's freaking me out.

1319
00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:38.200
- I know I promised
I wouldn't let myself

1320
00:49:38.333 --> 00:49:39.266
get sucked into this.

1321
00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:42.400
but honestly I can't
stop thinking about him.

1322
00:49:42.533 --> 00:49:43.300
Is that insane?

1323
00:49:43.433 --> 00:49:46.433
- No. but this is...

1324
00:49:46.567 --> 00:49:49.600
Gin. again. that's
three games in a row.

1325
00:49:49.734 --> 00:49:51.767
- No deflecting. I need
your help with this.

1326
00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:52.934
- Okay. Sorry. sorry.

1327
00:49:53.066 --> 00:49:54.967
I totally understand.

1328
00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:57.433
Partly because I had a
great time with Luke today.

1329
00:49:57.567 --> 00:49:58.734
- Not you. too.

1330
00:49:58.867 --> 00:50:00.600
- We spent two hours
together at the ranch

1331
00:50:00.734 --> 00:50:01.767
and it felt like
it was 20 minutes.

1332
00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:03.100
- I know what that means.

1333
00:50:03.233 --> 00:50:04.066
- It's the worst.

1334
00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:05.000
A sure sign that
you're in to somebody.

1335
00:50:05.133 --> 00:50:07.800
(sighs) How did we
let them get to us?

1336
00:50:07.934 --> 00:50:09.600
We totally caved to
their manipulations.

1337
00:50:09.734 --> 00:50:11.200
- You know what. no.

1338
00:50:11.333 --> 00:50:12.433
we have to give ourselves
more credit than that.

1339
00:50:12.567 --> 00:50:14.400
What we're feeling
could be real.

1340
00:50:14.533 --> 00:50:16.900
We just have to make sure
we're vetting it properly.

1341
00:50:17.033 --> 00:50:17.900
- Exactly.

1342
00:50:18.033 --> 00:50:19.000
And we'll help each
other stay extra aware

1343
00:50:19.133 --> 00:50:21.367
so we don't get distracted
by the hype of the show.

1344
00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:22.133
- Right?

1345
00:50:22.266 --> 00:50:23.300
(knocking on door)

1346
00:50:23.433 --> 00:50:27.100
- Oh. my gosh. a heart!
- I hope it's a fantasy date!

1347
00:50:27.233 --> 00:50:29.967
- Marco's taking you on the
deserted island fantasy date?

1348
00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:31.533
- Don't be too offended.

1349
00:50:31.667 --> 00:50:33.400
it's not like these
dates are Marco's idea.

1350
00:50:33.533 --> 00:50:36.533
More likely this came from Luke.

1351
00:50:36.667 --> 00:50:39.934
- Well. don't make it personal.
He's just doing his job.

1352
00:50:40.066 --> 00:50:41.200
- You're right.

1353
00:50:41.333 --> 00:50:42.266
No need to get
distracted. right?

1354
00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:43.333
I mean. we can't control
what's gonna happen.

1355
00:50:43.467 --> 00:50:45.433
but we can make sure we
stay on an even keel.

1356
00:50:45.567 --> 00:50:46.767
- Right?

1357
00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:50.100
(upbeat lively music)

1358
00:50:56.934 --> 00:50:59.200
- So where's Marco and
the rest of the crew?

1359
00:50:59.333 --> 00:51:00.967
- Had to drop them off early

1360
00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:03.533
to make sure Luke
got all his B-roll.

1361
00:51:03.667 --> 00:51:05.600
We're a splinter unit
today. Single camera.

1362
00:51:05.734 --> 00:51:06.533
(water sloshing)

1363
00:51:06.667 --> 00:51:08.433
- And a single boat. I guess.

1364
00:51:08.567 --> 00:51:11.533
- Well. there's only one
person insured to drive talent.

1365
00:51:11.667 --> 00:51:12.633
I'll give you a
hint who that is.

1366
00:51:12.767 --> 00:51:15.433
She's walking beside you
and smells like gasoline.

1367
00:51:15.567 --> 00:51:16.367
- Oh.

1368
00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:21.467
Uh. do I have to
do cross-fit. too?

1369
00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:24.967
- No. you are all booked
up for a romantic walk

1370
00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:26.533
on the beach.

1371
00:51:26.667 --> 00:51:28.467
Romantic shell collecting
and a romantic lunch.

1372
00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:29.967
- Okay. everybody.

1373
00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:31.533
We got two hours to shoot this

1374
00:51:31.667 --> 00:51:34.333
before the swell gets to
be too big the S.S. Minnow.

1375
00:51:34.467 --> 00:51:38.433
So. let's do fantasy
speed date. Okay?

1376
00:51:38.567 --> 00:51:40.667
We'll just do rapid
fire. No brakes.

1377
00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:41.500
All right. Let's move.

1378
00:51:41.633 --> 00:51:42.834
Come on.

1379
00:51:42.967 --> 00:51:44.900
- He really takes all
the romance out of it.

1380
00:51:45.767 --> 00:51:47.333
- Keep telling yourself that.

1381
00:51:52.266 --> 00:51:54.333
- And action!

1382
00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:58.600
- Here. What do you think?

1383
00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:01.667
- Oh. that'll look great
on the necklace I'm making.

1384
00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:03.667
- You make jewelry. too.

1385
00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:04.633
- I dabble.

1386
00:52:04.767 --> 00:52:06.567
- I swear. you and
Bree are like twins.

1387
00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:07.533
- (laughs) Really?

1388
00:52:07.667 --> 00:52:08.600
- Yeah.

1389
00:52:08.734 --> 00:52:10.033
You both say some of
the same little phrases.

1390
00:52:10.166 --> 00:52:11.200
and some of the same mannerisms.

1391
00:52:11.333 --> 00:52:12.767
It's really cute.

1392
00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:14.433
- Well it makes sense.

1393
00:52:14.567 --> 00:52:16.667
We have been attached at the
hips since the third grade.

1394
00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:17.600
- That long. huh?

1395
00:52:17.734 --> 00:52:19.333
- Well. there was
a brief separation

1396
00:52:19.467 --> 00:52:21.433
in February of seventh grade.

1397
00:52:21.567 --> 00:52:22.433
But other than that. yes.

1398
00:52:22.567 --> 00:52:24.433
- Uh. oh. What was the drama?

1399
00:52:24.567 --> 00:52:25.700
(Hayley laughs)

1400
00:52:25.834 --> 00:52:30.166
- A boy she liked sent me a
cookie gram for Valentine's Day.

1401
00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:31.233
It was a whole thing.

1402
00:52:31.367 --> 00:52:32.266
- I can imagine.

1403
00:52:33.467 --> 00:52:36.433
- Since then we vowed never
to let a boy come between us.

1404
00:52:36.567 --> 00:52:38.433
- Until now at least.

1405
00:52:38.567 --> 00:52:39.467
- Nice try.

1406
00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:41.667
We came here in solidarity
and whatever happens

1407
00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:43.066
we're gonna leave her
stronger than ever.

1408
00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:44.567
- Well. we can't use that clip.

1409
00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:45.367
- Just let it play out.

1410
00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:46.633
- Emily's gonna lose it

1411
00:52:46.767 --> 00:52:49.233
if these girls keep themselves
in this friendship bubble.

1412
00:52:49.367 --> 00:52:50.767
- I think it's endearing.

1413
00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:52.500
- Making necklaces
for each other.

1414
00:52:52.633 --> 00:52:54.433
Don't they know they
on a reality show?

1415
00:52:54.567 --> 00:52:55.700
- What's the matter.

1416
00:52:55.834 --> 00:52:57.100
You never had a
best friend before?

1417
00:52:57.233 --> 00:52:58.200
- I did once.

1418
00:52:58.333 --> 00:53:00.600
but then he got obsessed
with somebody at work

1419
00:53:00.734 --> 00:53:02.300
and faded into obscurity.

1420
00:53:03.767 --> 00:53:05.600
Oh. boy. it's worse
than I thought.

1421
00:53:05.734 --> 00:53:07.333
- Hey. everybody
out of the water.

1422
00:53:07.467 --> 00:53:08.633
- What's wrong?

1423
00:53:08.767 --> 00:53:09.367
(dramatic music)
- Think I saw a...

1424
00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:11.767
(Marco screams)
- Jellyfish.

1425
00:53:13.867 --> 00:53:16.400
Hey. we got a medic at
the dock waiting for you.

1426
00:53:16.533 --> 00:53:17.433
Okay. You're gonna be all right.

1427
00:53:17.567 --> 00:53:18.500
- Ah! It really hurts.

1428
00:53:18.633 --> 00:53:21.100
- Well. at least it
wasn't a box jellyfish.

1429
00:53:21.233 --> 00:53:23.000
But I am glad we got
you out when we did.

1430
00:53:23.133 --> 00:53:24.300
Hey. hey. you getting all this?

1431
00:53:24.433 --> 00:53:25.567
- Seriously?

1432
00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:28.000
- Hey. we can't
all go in one trip.

1433
00:53:28.133 --> 00:53:29.934
This boat maxes out
at three people.

1434
00:53:30.066 --> 00:53:31.934
I gotta drive.
Oscar's gotta shoot.

1435
00:53:32.066 --> 00:53:34.066
We can't let today
be a total wash.

1436
00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:35.633
- Okay. Well. I can stay.
- I'll stay.

1437
00:53:35.767 --> 00:53:37.333
- Is that okay. Hayley?

1438
00:53:37.467 --> 00:53:38.133
- Of course.

1439
00:53:38.266 --> 00:53:40.000
- Great.

1440
00:53:40.133 --> 00:53:42.066
If there's any trouble.

1441
00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:43.967
it's plenty of
supplies in the hut.

1442
00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:45.500
- Wait. what kind of supplies?

1443
00:53:45.633 --> 00:53:47.133
- Wine. catered lunch.

1444
00:53:47.266 --> 00:53:49.433
a whole lot of tiki torches.

1445
00:53:49.567 --> 00:53:50.633
- Oh.

1446
00:53:50.767 --> 00:53:55.633
(quirky music)
(boat engine firing)

1447
00:54:00.633 --> 00:54:01.467
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1448
00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:02.567
- Okay.
- Okay.

1449
00:54:09.133 --> 00:54:10.800
(Marco groaning)

1450
00:54:10.934 --> 00:54:12.633
- The doctor thinks you'll
be walking within the hour.

1451
00:54:12.767 --> 00:54:13.633
That's a relief.

1452
00:54:13.767 --> 00:54:14.667
- For me or for the show?

1453
00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:17.233
- Marco. please. What
do you take me for?

1454
00:54:17.367 --> 00:54:20.633
Say the word and I will
cancel the rest of the day.

1455
00:54:20.767 --> 00:54:24.300
We can definitely postpone the
paint and sip with Vanessa.

1456
00:54:24.433 --> 00:54:25.033
- Thank you.

1457
00:54:26.467 --> 00:54:27.467
- Marie. can you let her know?

1458
00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:28.633
- You're the boss.

1459
00:54:28.767 --> 00:54:29.734
- And when you're done.

1460
00:54:29.867 --> 00:54:31.367
will you let Bree know that
her golf date with Marco

1461
00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:32.500
isn't going to happen.

1462
00:54:32.633 --> 00:54:35.066
I'm sure she'll be upset.
so break it to her gently.

1463
00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:37.667
- You know what? I
think I'll manage.

1464
00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:39.300
It's already feeling better

1465
00:54:39.433 --> 00:54:40.500
and I don't want to put
you guys behind schedule.

1466
00:54:40.633 --> 00:54:41.400
So-

1467
00:54:41.533 --> 00:54:42.467
- What a trooper. Thank you.

1468
00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:43.533
- No problem.

1469
00:54:43.667 --> 00:54:45.500
- Now where's. Luke. I
need an updated shot list.

1470
00:54:45.633 --> 00:54:47.633
- We had to leave them on
the island with Hayley.

1471
00:54:47.767 --> 00:54:49.800
The capacity maxes
out at three people.

1472
00:54:49.934 --> 00:54:51.967
- The boat fits five people.

1473
00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:52.734
- I did not know that.

1474
00:54:52.867 --> 00:54:53.667
- Well. now that you do.

1475
00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:55.500
why don't you go get them?

1476
00:54:55.633 --> 00:54:57.033
- Copy that.

1477
00:54:57.166 --> 00:54:59.533
Just as soon as the
tide's back out.

1478
00:55:02.367 --> 00:55:05.567
(upbeat bright music)

1479
00:55:08.233 --> 00:55:11.867
- Hey. it looks like
Marco's recovering nicely...

1480
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.734
and Marie's gonna come back as
soon as the swell dies down.

1481
00:55:14.867 --> 00:55:15.700
- No cameras.

1482
00:55:15.834 --> 00:55:17.200
a private beach.

1483
00:55:17.333 --> 00:55:19.266
catering. wine...

1484
00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:20.400
Unacceptable.

1485
00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:23.567
- Is this a new one?

1486
00:55:24.367 --> 00:55:25.433
(Hayley laughs)

1487
00:55:25.567 --> 00:55:26.767
- I made it this morning.

1488
00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:27.734
Nothing you can't
do with scissors.

1489
00:55:27.867 --> 00:55:29.300
safety pins and hem tape.

1490
00:55:29.433 --> 00:55:30.700
- How did you even
get into all that?

1491
00:55:30.834 --> 00:55:32.233
- Designing my own clothes?

1492
00:55:33.367 --> 00:55:34.967
It sprang from desperation.

1493
00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:38.767
My mom made all my dance teams
outfits in middle school.

1494
00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:40.033
but then she bought this thing

1495
00:55:40.166 --> 00:55:42.700
that blinged out
your leotard and...

1496
00:55:42.834 --> 00:55:44.734
I'm sure you have no
idea what I'm talking.

1497
00:55:44.867 --> 00:55:46.767
- Are you kidding me?
I've got twin sisters.

1498
00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:49.233
Their closet was
fully bedazzled.

1499
00:55:49.367 --> 00:55:52.734
- Oh. I stand corrected.
(Luke laughs)

1500
00:55:52.867 --> 00:55:57.400
So anyway. I took over on
dance wear and it just clicked.

1501
00:55:57.533 --> 00:55:59.433
I love helping people
look their best.

1502
00:55:59.567 --> 00:56:01.300
And then I got a scholarship
to fashion school

1503
00:56:01.433 --> 00:56:02.967
and the rest is history.

1504
00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:03.867
Well...

1505
00:56:05.433 --> 00:56:07.433
except for the part where
I haven't been able to find

1506
00:56:07.567 --> 00:56:09.667
investors or successfully
launch my line.

1507
00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:11.166
That part is kind of TBD.

1508
00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:11.967
- It'll happen.

1509
00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:13.433
I mean...

1510
00:56:13.567 --> 00:56:15.033
it takes a lot of resilience
to do what you do.

1511
00:56:15.166 --> 00:56:16.934
People like you don't give up.

1512
00:56:17.066 --> 00:56:18.300
- You mean. people like us?

1513
00:56:18.433 --> 00:56:20.834
- Mm. I don't know about that.

1514
00:56:20.967 --> 00:56:23.600
- You're the hardest
worker on this set.

1515
00:56:23.734 --> 00:56:24.800
Well. maybe except for Marie.

1516
00:56:24.934 --> 00:56:25.967
- Fair.

1517
00:56:27.133 --> 00:56:29.000
- I mean. come on you're
show running a network show.

1518
00:56:29.133 --> 00:56:31.367
you wear the golden headphones.

1519
00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:33.300
you've already succeeded.

1520
00:56:33.433 --> 00:56:34.767
- Yeah. but it's
not what I wanted.

1521
00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:36.700
It's not what I set out to do.

1522
00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:39.767
- Okay. then what did
you set out to do?

1523
00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:42.200
- You sure you want to
know. it's a long story.

1524
00:56:44.734 --> 00:56:45.834
- I think I have time.

1525
00:56:45.967 --> 00:56:48.533
(Luke chuckles)

1526
00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.967
- I'm glad we have
this alone time.

1527
00:57:00.166 --> 00:57:02.200
I started to feel
so distant from you

1528
00:57:02.333 --> 00:57:04.967
ever since. you know
who came on the show.

1529
00:57:05.934 --> 00:57:07.834
- I think it through
us all for a loop.

1530
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:10.767
- None of that matters now.

1531
00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:12.734
It's just me and you...

1532
00:57:12.867 --> 00:57:14.800
and the canvas. of course.

1533
00:57:14.934 --> 00:57:17.867
I'm dying to see what the
muse has inspired you to do.

1534
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.967
- Oh. I think we
might have to manage

1535
00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:21.734
your expectations a bit.

1536
00:57:21.867 --> 00:57:22.967
- I'm sure it'll be great.

1537
00:57:24.166 --> 00:57:26.800
As a thalassophile-

1538
00:57:26.934 --> 00:57:27.934
- Thalasso-what?

1539
00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:31.767
- Excuse me. it means
lover of the sea.

1540
00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:34.633
Naturally I draw my
inspiration from the deep.

1541
00:57:35.867 --> 00:57:37.967
But this time I was
inspired by something

1542
00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:40.066
equally as intriguing...

1543
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:41.767
You.

1544
00:57:44.767 --> 00:57:46.200
Marco?

1545
00:57:46.333 --> 00:57:47.400
- Hmm.

1546
00:57:47.533 --> 00:57:48.900
- Did you hear what I said?

1547
00:57:49.033 --> 00:57:50.767
- Yeah. totally.

1548
00:57:52.266 --> 00:57:53.934
I'm sorry. Can you say it again?

1549
00:57:54.066 --> 00:57:57.533
- Look. it's okay.
No need to apologize.

1550
00:57:57.667 --> 00:57:59.734
You've had a really
stressful day.

1551
00:57:59.867 --> 00:58:00.700
- Yeah.

1552
00:58:01.633 --> 00:58:03.500
- I'm ready to show
you my painting.

1553
00:58:04.467 --> 00:58:07.433
(quirky music)

1554
00:58:07.567 --> 00:58:08.834
What do you think?

1555
00:58:08.967 --> 00:58:09.734
- Wow!

1556
00:58:11.934 --> 00:58:12.667
That is something.

1557
00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:13.934
- I know.

1558
00:58:14.066 --> 00:58:14.834
- The detail.

1559
00:58:14.967 --> 00:58:17.100
- The scales are
perfectly to scale.

1560
00:58:17.233 --> 00:58:18.700
That was the hardest part.

1561
00:58:18.834 --> 00:58:20.367
- This is not good.

1562
00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:22.033
- It's better than
anything I could do.

1563
00:58:22.166 --> 00:58:23.533
- I'm not talking
about the Merman.

1564
00:58:23.667 --> 00:58:24.834
I'm talking about the fact

1565
00:58:24.967 --> 00:58:25.867
that they've been
painting for an hour

1566
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.934
and he said a total
of five words to her.

1567
00:58:28.066 --> 00:58:30.800
He's losing all interest in
our highest-rated contestant.

1568
00:58:30.934 --> 00:58:32.533
- Well. maybe it's just
the jellyfish incident.

1569
00:58:32.667 --> 00:58:33.600
that really shook him up.

1570
00:58:33.734 --> 00:58:34.867
- What shook him up was
Bree coming on the show.

1571
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.266
You saw the way that he reacted
when I canceled their date.

1572
00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:38.667
a complete 180.

1573
00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:40.333
He's falling in love with her.

1574
00:58:40.467 --> 00:58:41.934
- Isn't that the point?

1575
00:58:42.066 --> 00:58:44.300
- Not when you could see
it coming from a mile away.

1576
00:58:44.433 --> 00:58:46.300
America wants a surprise ending.

1577
00:58:46.433 --> 00:58:47.667
They want to be shocked.

1578
00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:50.200
We're gonna have
to tip the scales.

1579
00:58:55.333 --> 00:58:58.500
- It's a docu-series where we
take people 100 years or older

1580
00:58:58.633 --> 00:59:01.734
and we do a featurette
on their lives.

1581
00:59:01.867 --> 00:59:02.567
their history.

1582
00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:04.166
the impact they've made.

1583
00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:05.567
it's called "Centurions."

1584
00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:07.667
It's kind of a play words.

1585
00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:09.200
- I would totally
binge watch that.

1586
00:59:09.333 --> 00:59:10.667
- Really?
- Yeah.

1587
00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:12.433
I mean think about the
collective knowledge they have.

1588
00:59:12.567 --> 00:59:14.033
- Right?

1589
00:59:14.166 --> 00:59:14.967
Like think about all the
stories that they must have.

1590
00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:16.200
And you know. a whole
goal would be...

1591
00:59:16.333 --> 00:59:20.166
to capture their lives and
preserve their memories forever.

1592
00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:21.266
- That is a great idea.

1593
00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:22.834
You should definitely do it.

1594
00:59:22.967 --> 00:59:24.567
- Well. it's easier
said than done.

1595
00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:26.233
- I know the feeling
all too well.

1596
00:59:26.367 --> 00:59:28.266
- I mean. I swore that
I wouldn't do this show

1597
00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:29.066
after the first season.

1598
00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:31.266
and here I am five years later.

1599
00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:33.033
- Well. you got promoted.
That's a big deal.

1600
00:59:33.166 --> 00:59:34.000
- No. it is. Yeah.

1601
00:59:34.133 --> 00:59:36.600
And if the network
likes what I do here.

1602
00:59:36.734 --> 00:59:39.166
they might take a risk on
my series in the future.

1603
00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:40.100
Who knows.

1604
00:59:40.233 --> 00:59:41.600
- That's great.

1605
00:59:41.734 --> 00:59:43.266
- It's a lot of pressure.

1606
00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:45.433
- Pressure can turn
coal into diamonds.

1607
00:59:47.467 --> 00:59:48.734
- [Luke] Hmm.

1608
00:59:48.867 --> 00:59:53.867
(bright music)
(golf cart engine running)

1609
00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:59.433
(Marco laughing)

1610
01:00:00.667 --> 01:00:02.333
- They gave you
your own golf cart?

1611
01:00:02.467 --> 01:00:04.700
- Only after I was
attacked by a wild animal.

1612
01:00:04.834 --> 01:00:06.834
- Well. I'm happy
you're out and about.

1613
01:00:06.967 --> 01:00:10.066
but we should probably
cancel the golf date. right?

1614
01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:12.700
- I was actually wondering if
we could head up there early.

1615
01:00:12.834 --> 01:00:14.200
get there before
the cameras arrive.

1616
01:00:14.333 --> 01:00:16.934
- Okay. But where
are the golf clubs?

1617
01:00:17.867 --> 01:00:19.066
- Don't worry about it.

1618
01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.000
- How are we gonna golf
with no golf clubs?

1619
01:00:21.133 --> 01:00:22.233
- Do you trust me?

1620
01:00:24.333 --> 01:00:26.867
(Bree chuckles)

1621
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.066
- Hang on.
- Okay.

1622
01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:32.000
Whoa!

1623
01:00:32.133 --> 01:00:34.333
(laughs) Why are going so fast?

1624
01:00:34.467 --> 01:00:35.600
- [Marco] Because I
don't want to miss it?

1625
01:00:35.734 --> 01:00:36.533
Coming up.

1626
01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.100
- [Bree] Slow down.

1627
01:00:39.233 --> 01:00:40.033
(Bree laughs)

1628
01:00:40.166 --> 01:00:41.066
- [Marco] Come on.
come on. Come on.

1629
01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:42.400
10 more seconds.

1630
01:00:42.533 --> 01:00:43.934
- [Bree] What are we
waiting for exactly?

1631
01:00:44.066 --> 01:00:45.066
- [Marco] For your wildest
dream to come true.

1632
01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:46.734
- This better be good.

1633
01:00:46.867 --> 01:00:47.533
- All right.

1634
01:00:47.667 --> 01:00:48.333
5...

1635
01:00:48.467 --> 01:00:49.166
4...

1636
01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:49.934
3...

1637
01:00:50.066 --> 01:00:51.033
2...

1638
01:00:51.166 --> 01:00:54.266
(water spattering)

1639
01:00:55.133 --> 01:00:55.967
Ta-da!

1640
01:00:57.133 --> 01:00:58.500
Hawaiian rainbows...

1641
01:00:58.633 --> 01:00:59.533
just like you asked for.

1642
01:00:59.667 --> 01:01:01.600
I told you I'd find you one.

1643
01:01:01.734 --> 01:01:04.166
- It's so beautiful. but...

1644
01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:05.233
I don't think it counts.

1645
01:01:05.367 --> 01:01:06.467
- Oh. come on.

1646
01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:08.967
Do I at least get
credit for effort?

1647
01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:10.900
- Extra credit.

1648
01:01:11.033 --> 01:01:13.700
(romantic music)

1649
01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:18.433
So...

1650
01:01:18.567 --> 01:01:19.633
what do we do now?

1651
01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:22.567
- There's only one option
as far as I'm concerned.

1652
01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:26.433
(both laughing and screaming)

1653
01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:30.800
(romantic music)

1654
01:01:41.533 --> 01:01:43.734
- [Hayley] So. what
did you decide?

1655
01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:44.667
- [Luke] What do you mean?

1656
01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:46.567
- About the next elimination?

1657
01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:47.834
No. one's around.

1658
01:01:47.967 --> 01:01:48.767
You can tell me.
who's it gonna be?

1659
01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:50.500
- You'll have to ask Marco.

1660
01:01:50.633 --> 01:01:51.834
- Oh. come on.

1661
01:01:51.967 --> 01:01:53.133
You don't have to
play coy with me.

1662
01:01:53.266 --> 01:01:54.133
I know you're the one
pulling the strings.

1663
01:01:54.266 --> 01:01:55.967
- Oh yeah. Okay. proof it.

1664
01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:59.100
- Oh. well first it was
the wardrobes switcheroo.

1665
01:01:59.233 --> 01:02:00.533
Then it was the earpiece reveal.

1666
01:02:00.667 --> 01:02:02.200
And then the clincher was

1667
01:02:02.333 --> 01:02:04.066
my name and what I'm
assuming was your handwriting

1668
01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:06.000
on the heart that Marco gave me.

1669
01:02:06.133 --> 01:02:07.133
- Very good. counsel.

1670
01:02:07.266 --> 01:02:08.400
You have any further evidence?

1671
01:02:08.533 --> 01:02:10.200
- Just tell me who
you're sending home.

1672
01:02:10.333 --> 01:02:11.100
Vanessa or me?

1673
01:02:11.233 --> 01:02:12.133
- How do you know
it's not. Bree?

1674
01:02:12.266 --> 01:02:14.133
- Well. you'd be stupid
to send Bree home.

1675
01:02:14.266 --> 01:02:15.633
she's the only one with any
actual chemistry with Marco.

1676
01:02:15.767 --> 01:02:18.467
- Why do you want to know
so bad? Are you nervous?

1677
01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:20.300
- Yeah. I'm nervous
I'm gonna get a heart.

1678
01:02:20.433 --> 01:02:21.900
I don't want to
be in the finale.

1679
01:02:22.033 --> 01:02:23.333
- What happened to
wearing your evening gown

1680
01:02:23.467 --> 01:02:24.400
on national television?

1681
01:02:24.533 --> 01:02:26.867
- It's not worth getting
pitted against Bree.

1682
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:27.800
Even though it's fake drama.

1683
01:02:27.934 --> 01:02:29.200
it feels so seventh grade.

1684
01:02:29.333 --> 01:02:30.500
- Cookie gate part two.

1685
01:02:30.633 --> 01:02:31.500
- Exactly.

1686
01:02:31.633 --> 01:02:34.700
Just send me gracefully
into the night.

1687
01:02:34.834 --> 01:02:36.533
I'll find a better way
to promote my brand.

1688
01:02:36.667 --> 01:02:38.867
- So you want me to get
you eliminated. huh?

1689
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.233
- Mm-hmm.

1690
01:02:40.367 --> 01:02:42.333
- Well. there's just
one problem with that.

1691
01:02:42.467 --> 01:02:43.700
- Oh. yeah. What's that?

1692
01:02:44.533 --> 01:02:46.934
- I don't want you to leave.

1693
01:02:48.266 --> 01:02:50.533
- Hey. you two!
(boat engine roaring)

1694
01:02:50.667 --> 01:02:52.033
What I miss!

1695
01:02:52.166 --> 01:02:52.934
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

1696
01:02:53.066 --> 01:02:55.367
- [Marie] Okay.
then. all aboard!

1697
01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:06.734
- Ma'am?

1698
01:03:06.867 --> 01:03:08.467
- Can this wait? I'm
in meditation here.

1699
01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:09.567
- Sorry to bother you.

1700
01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:11.467
But I think I found what
you were looking for.

1701
01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:15.266
(dramatic music)

1702
01:03:28.633 --> 01:03:32.033
- Uh! Well. thanks for the ride.

1703
01:03:32.166 --> 01:03:33.500
- No problem.

1704
01:03:33.633 --> 01:03:35.133
- Hey. so get some
sleep tonight.

1705
01:03:35.266 --> 01:03:36.367
Big day tomorrow.

1706
01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:37.867
- I will. Thanks.

1707
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:38.867
- Good night.

1708
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.166
- Good night.
- Good night.

1709
01:03:45.934 --> 01:03:48.500
Anytime you want to
thank me. I'm right here.

1710
01:03:48.633 --> 01:03:52.266
- Thank you. for killing the
moment with your water rescue.

1711
01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:53.367
- No. Did I really?

1712
01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:54.500
- No. it's not your fault.

1713
01:03:54.633 --> 01:03:56.333
But your timing was uncanny.

1714
01:03:56.467 --> 01:03:59.967
- You had six hours
for a moment to happen.

1715
01:04:00.166 --> 01:04:01.367
That's on you.

1716
01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:02.400
- I didn't know I
was on the clock.

1717
01:04:02.533 --> 01:04:03.934
Usually I'm the one
pulling the heartstrings.

1718
01:04:04.066 --> 01:04:04.867
How long you've been
planning that one.

1719
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.834
- That was pure inspiration.

1720
01:04:06.967 --> 01:04:08.834
I saw an opportunity
and I pounced.

1721
01:04:08.967 --> 01:04:11.433
- Well. it was some next level
scheming and manipulation

1722
01:04:11.567 --> 01:04:13.266
on your part. I must say.

1723
01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:15.934
- Maybe I'm gunning for
your golden headsets.

1724
01:04:16.066 --> 01:04:18.600
- Well. they might be available
sooner than you might think.

1725
01:04:18.734 --> 01:04:20.000
How's Emily?

1726
01:04:20.133 --> 01:04:21.367
- Meant to warn you about that.

1727
01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:22.934
I'm not sure what was going on.

1728
01:04:23.066 --> 01:04:24.533
but she's got that
look in her eyes.

1729
01:04:24.667 --> 01:04:26.033
- Oh. no.

1730
01:04:26.166 --> 01:04:27.200
The. "I'm gonna take
matters into my own hands."

1731
01:04:27.333 --> 01:04:28.000
crazy eyes?

1732
01:04:28.133 --> 01:04:28.900
- Yup. That's the one.

1733
01:04:29.033 --> 01:04:31.266
- I know it all too well.

1734
01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:33.867
(upbeat music)

1735
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.233
- Not bad having my
own personal stylist.

1736
01:04:40.367 --> 01:04:41.200
(Hayley laughs)

1737
01:04:41.333 --> 01:04:43.100
You really are a genius.

1738
01:04:43.233 --> 01:04:44.600
- I'm glad somebody thinks so.

1739
01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:48.033
I think blue for tomorrow.

1740
01:04:48.166 --> 01:04:49.767
Definitely.
- Okay.

1741
01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:52.834
I'm sad that the world will
have to wait to see you

1742
01:04:52.967 --> 01:04:55.367
don your amazing evening gown.

1743
01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:57.734
- I'm not sad at all.

1744
01:04:57.867 --> 01:04:59.266
- You sure?

1745
01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:03.000
- Honestly. I'm glad I
came to support you. and...

1746
01:05:03.133 --> 01:05:05.667
it's been really nice
getting to know Luke.

1747
01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:06.934
but when I think
about the anxiety

1748
01:05:07.066 --> 01:05:08.033
of standing up
there next to you.

1749
01:05:08.166 --> 01:05:09.667
pretending I want Marco
to choose me over you.

1750
01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:11.433
It just feels...

1751
01:05:11.567 --> 01:05:12.667
wrong.

1752
01:05:13.767 --> 01:05:14.800
It doesn't matter how
many dresses I would sell.

1753
01:05:14.934 --> 01:05:16.400
it's not worth it.

1754
01:05:16.533 --> 01:05:18.300
- Well. I mean. assuming
he picks me for the finale.

1755
01:05:18.433 --> 01:05:20.433
at least one of your
dresses will be featured.

1756
01:05:20.567 --> 01:05:22.567
- Oh. okay.

1757
01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:25.333
Uh. there's no assuming here.

1758
01:05:25.467 --> 01:05:27.000
I talked to Luke.

1759
01:05:27.133 --> 01:05:28.433
he said he would eliminate me

1760
01:05:28.567 --> 01:05:30.433
and Marco's obsessed with you.

1761
01:05:30.567 --> 01:05:32.967
So. yeah. you're gonna
be in the finale.

1762
01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:35.967
- Oh. I can't believe
I'm actually falling

1763
01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:37.667
for the King of Hearts.

1764
01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:40.500
- Just call him Marco. it
sounds way more normal.

1765
01:05:40.633 --> 01:05:42.567
- Right? Totally.

1766
01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:44.934
- (laughs) That's odd. Huh?

1767
01:05:45.066 --> 01:05:48.133
I don't see any like kissing
Marco in the sprinklers

1768
01:05:48.266 --> 01:05:49.433
on your big plan.

1769
01:05:49.567 --> 01:05:51.967
- I guess I can throw
that out the window.

1770
01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:53.467
- Oh. I think you can burn it.

1771
01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:55.900
It's the last remaining evidence
of your diabolical plan.

1772
01:05:56.033 --> 01:05:57.433
- Yes. definitely destroy it.

1773
01:05:57.567 --> 01:05:58.333
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1774
01:05:58.467 --> 01:05:59.200
It's gone.

1775
01:05:59.333 --> 01:06:01.567
- Thank you.
- We're done with that.

1776
01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:04.200
(lively music)

1777
01:06:08.633 --> 01:06:11.533
(balls clacking)

1778
01:06:13.333 --> 01:06:14.200
- Marco.

1779
01:06:14.333 --> 01:06:15.200
- Hey.

1780
01:06:15.333 --> 01:06:16.000
- Hi.

1781
01:06:16.133 --> 01:06:17.633
- Everything okay?

1782
01:06:17.767 --> 01:06:19.500
- I'll let you be
the judge of that.

1783
01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:28.033
- [Announcer] On the next
episode of "Heart Choices."

1784
01:06:28.166 --> 01:06:29.033
Will...

1785
01:06:29.166 --> 01:06:29.834
he...

1786
01:06:29.967 --> 01:06:30.633
find...

1787
01:06:30.767 --> 01:06:32.233
out?

1788
01:06:32.367 --> 01:06:34.734
- It's a game. a game I'm
gonna be really good at.

1789
01:06:34.867 --> 01:06:36.300
I have a plan.

1790
01:06:36.433 --> 01:06:39.400
I don't want to win. I
want to be first runner up.

1791
01:06:39.533 --> 01:06:42.333
First runner up becomes
Queen of Hearts next season.

1792
01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.667
Move over. Marco.
it's my time to shine.

1793
01:06:46.967 --> 01:06:49.600
(dramatic music)

1794
01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:52.400
- Did she really say all that?

1795
01:06:52.533 --> 01:06:53.166
- You saw the tape?

1796
01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:54.734
Listen. I don't usually do this.

1797
01:06:54.867 --> 01:06:56.667
but I thought you
deserved to know

1798
01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:58.166
before the heart ceremony.

1799
01:06:59.633 --> 01:07:00.467
- I appreciate that.

1800
01:07:02.367 --> 01:07:04.700
- This isn't a
reflection of you. Okay.

1801
01:07:04.834 --> 01:07:06.367
America loves you.

1802
01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:08.633
They're gonna back
your decision 100%.

1803
01:07:15.333 --> 01:07:17.133
(dramatic music)

1804
01:07:17.266 --> 01:07:19.433
- [Luke] Hey. handsome.
You ready for tonight?

1805
01:07:19.567 --> 01:07:20.333
- Yup.

1806
01:07:21.934 --> 01:07:22.600
- Everything okay?

1807
01:07:22.734 --> 01:07:24.600
Yeah. Just got my game face on.

1808
01:07:24.734 --> 01:07:25.400
- Ah. okay.

1809
01:07:25.533 --> 01:07:26.600
Well. you know the deal.

1810
01:07:29.367 --> 01:07:31.533
- Thanks. but I don't think
I'll be needing that tonight.

1811
01:07:31.667 --> 01:07:32.333
- You sure?

1812
01:07:32.467 --> 01:07:33.767
- I don't want to sound canned.

1813
01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:35.133
- What?

1814
01:07:35.266 --> 01:07:35.900
Well. you don't have to use it.

1815
01:07:36.033 --> 01:07:37.133
You know. it's just a backup.

1816
01:07:37.266 --> 01:07:38.467
- You said it sounds better

1817
01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:39.633
when it comes from
the heart. right?

1818
01:07:41.533 --> 01:07:42.600
That's what I'm gonna do.

1819
01:07:44.567 --> 01:07:45.533
- Okay. All right.

1820
01:07:45.667 --> 01:07:47.700
Well. here are your hearts.

1821
01:07:47.834 --> 01:07:50.200
I think you'll be
pleased with the choices.

1822
01:07:50.333 --> 01:07:53.734
(gentle poignant music)

1823
01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:04.533
- [Marie] All
right! Quiet on set!

1824
01:08:04.667 --> 01:08:06.700
And we're rolling!

1825
01:08:06.834 --> 01:08:08.166
- And action!

1826
01:08:09.467 --> 01:08:10.700
- We welcome all of Heart Nation

1827
01:08:10.834 --> 01:08:13.633
back to tonight's
elimination ceremony.

1828
01:08:13.767 --> 01:08:14.934
Two contestants will
leave with a heart.

1829
01:08:15.066 --> 01:08:17.767
and one with there's broken.

1830
01:08:17.900 --> 01:08:20.767
Marco. what's going through
your head right now?

1831
01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:22.000
- A lot of reflection.

1832
01:08:23.166 --> 01:08:24.100
You know. so much has happened
over the last few days

1833
01:08:24.233 --> 01:08:27.200
and I just keep going
through it all in my mind.

1834
01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:30.166
I've spent what I thought
was some real quality time

1835
01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:31.767
with these three women.

1836
01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:33.633
And I've learned a
lot about who they are

1837
01:08:33.767 --> 01:08:35.233
and what makes them tick.

1838
01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:39.767
And I think in return. I've
shared a lot about myself.

1839
01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:40.667
So now I have...

1840
01:08:42.266 --> 01:08:43.033
a big decision to make.

1841
01:08:43.166 --> 01:08:44.800
- You certainly do.

1842
01:08:44.934 --> 01:08:47.533
So. what is your Heart's Choice?

1843
01:08:49.467 --> 01:08:51.100
- Okay. stick to the
game plan. Marco.

1844
01:08:51.233 --> 01:08:52.066
don't let me down.

1845
01:08:53.767 --> 01:08:54.934
- Bree...

1846
01:08:55.066 --> 01:08:56.633
can you step forward?

1847
01:08:56.767 --> 01:08:58.100
- Of course.

1848
01:08:58.233 --> 01:08:58.800
- Yes.

1849
01:09:02.166 --> 01:09:04.500
- Everything changed for me

1850
01:09:04.633 --> 01:09:06.600
the day that you
came on this show.

1851
01:09:06.734 --> 01:09:08.533
Before that I was in my head.

1852
01:09:08.667 --> 01:09:10.500
I was self-conscious.

1853
01:09:10.633 --> 01:09:13.166
All I could think about was
how I was being perceived.

1854
01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:14.734
in truth I wasn't being me.

1855
01:09:15.734 --> 01:09:17.166
but you changed all that.

1856
01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:20.233
You pushed me to
do what I wanted

1857
01:09:20.367 --> 01:09:22.367
and to just be who I am.

1858
01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:27.467
to open up myself
to you. completely.

1859
01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:32.200
which is why it hurt me so badly

1860
01:09:32.333 --> 01:09:34.533
when I found out that
the only real reason

1861
01:09:34.667 --> 01:09:36.600
you came on this
show was for a chance

1862
01:09:36.734 --> 01:09:38.600
to be next year's
Queen of Hearts.

1863
01:09:38.734 --> 01:09:41.700
(dramatic music)

1864
01:09:41.834 --> 01:09:43.367
- Oh. no.

1865
01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:47.200
- Now this may be a game
to you. but it's not to me.

1866
01:09:47.333 --> 01:09:48.900
I need to know if that's true

1867
01:09:50.166 --> 01:09:51.734
and I need you to
be honest with me.

1868
01:09:51.867 --> 01:09:53.867
- Marco. you have to understand-

1869
01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.767
- Yes or no...

1870
01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:58.600
was that your plan all along?

1871
01:09:58.734 --> 01:10:01.700
(dramatic music)

1872
01:10:06.467 --> 01:10:07.233
- Yes.

1873
01:10:08.266 --> 01:10:10.867
- Well. then you've
made my choice for me.

1874
01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.100
Goodbye. Bree.

1875
01:10:12.233 --> 01:10:14.834
(dramatic music)

1876
01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:20.200
- And just like that.

1877
01:10:20.333 --> 01:10:23.567
we're down to our
final two contestants.

1878
01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:26.533
Tune in next week to see Marco
make his final Heart Choice.

1879
01:10:30.567 --> 01:10:32.000
- That wasn't
supposed to happen.

1880
01:10:32.133 --> 01:10:33.000
- Sure. it wasn't.

1881
01:10:33.133 --> 01:10:35.467
Well. I hope you get
your precious ratings.

1882
01:10:36.867 --> 01:10:38.000
- Cut!

1883
01:10:38.133 --> 01:10:39.233
- Oh no. no. no.

1884
01:10:39.367 --> 01:10:40.400
don't cut those cameras.

1885
01:10:40.533 --> 01:10:41.567
You keep rolling.

1886
01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:42.600
Don't you dare stop.

1887
01:10:42.734 --> 01:10:43.767
You keep rolling.

1888
01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:45.767
And you. don't even think about-

1889
01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:48.100
- Ah!
(water splashing)

1890
01:10:48.233 --> 01:10:49.233
- Hey. hey. hey.

1891
01:10:49.367 --> 01:10:50.033
Come here. Come here.

1892
01:10:50.166 --> 01:10:53.166
Come on. Come on.

1893
01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:54.533
There's a towel
right over there.

1894
01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:56.266
- Hayley!

1895
01:10:57.734 --> 01:11:00.867
(knocking on door)

1896
01:11:02.633 --> 01:11:05.800
I promise I had no idea
Marco was gonna do that.

1897
01:11:05.934 --> 01:11:07.834
- You sure it wasn't
a romantic assist

1898
01:11:07.967 --> 01:11:10.967
from one of your
trustee gut instincts.

1899
01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:12.900
- He didn't even wear
the earpiece tonight.

1900
01:11:13.033 --> 01:11:14.166
He refused to. Okay.

1901
01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:15.433
That was all him.

1902
01:11:15.567 --> 01:11:16.734
- So then what
did you say to him

1903
01:11:16.867 --> 01:11:17.734
to make him talk
to Bree like that?

1904
01:11:17.867 --> 01:11:19.467
- Nothing. I swear.

1905
01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:23.400
- Uh-huh.

1906
01:11:23.533 --> 01:11:24.400
And how do I know
you're not lying?

1907
01:11:24.533 --> 01:11:25.900
- He's telling the truth.

1908
01:11:26.033 --> 01:11:27.400
They must've filmed
our conversation

1909
01:11:27.533 --> 01:11:29.166
in the waiting room
of the audition.

1910
01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:30.100
Remember?

1911
01:11:32.367 --> 01:11:33.467
- You were filming that?

1912
01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:34.800
- We film everything.

1913
01:11:34.934 --> 01:11:37.400
Like if there was any
dirt in that footage.

1914
01:11:37.533 --> 01:11:38.467
Emily's minions were gonna find.

1915
01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:41.433
- And if Marco heard what
I said about the show.

1916
01:11:42.633 --> 01:11:44.667
he had every right
to be mad at me.

1917
01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:47.834
- Heaven forbid
you let a private
conversation go to waste?

1918
01:11:47.967 --> 01:11:49.600
- I'm gonna go pack my things.

1919
01:11:50.633 --> 01:11:51.700
- I'm so sorry.

1920
01:11:52.967 --> 01:11:54.467
- Don't be.

1921
01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:56.667
We knew what this was. it
was a game and we lost.

1922
01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:00.300
We should've never let ourselves
get caught up like this.

1923
01:12:00.433 --> 01:12:01.533
- Well. let me go talk to Marco.

1924
01:12:01.667 --> 01:12:02.967
Let me see if I can fix this.

1925
01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:04.300
- It'll still be fake.

1926
01:12:04.433 --> 01:12:05.834
Nothing you can do
will change the fact

1927
01:12:05.967 --> 01:12:07.400
that none of this is real.

1928
01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:10.166
- No. I guess you were right.

1929
01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:13.700
I guess the best love
stories can't be staged.

1930
01:12:13.834 --> 01:12:14.667
they just happen.

1931
01:12:15.967 --> 01:12:18.834
(sighs) Again. I'm sorry.

1932
01:12:19.834 --> 01:12:23.000
(gentle poignant music)

1933
01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:27.900
- So what are you gonna do now?

1934
01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:30.867
- I'm leaving with you.

1935
01:12:32.533 --> 01:12:34.200
- I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

1936
01:12:35.967 --> 01:12:37.834
- Listen. Hayley. you've
got two choices here.

1937
01:12:37.967 --> 01:12:40.200
Either play ball. show up
to the finale tomorrow.

1938
01:12:40.333 --> 01:12:42.567
wearing whatever you
want. by the way.

1939
01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:45.233
Or you go home and Bree now.

1940
01:12:45.367 --> 01:12:47.000
get sued by the studio and...

1941
01:12:47.967 --> 01:12:49.233
you'll cost Luke his job.

1942
01:12:51.633 --> 01:12:53.433
I'm sure you'll make
the right decision.

1943
01:12:57.700 --> 01:12:58.600
- You were so right.

1944
01:12:58.734 --> 01:13:01.700
This is a lose-lose
situation for both of us.

1945
01:13:01.834 --> 01:13:04.467
- It's fine. I can
fake it for one hour.

1946
01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:05.533
I'll put on a smile.

1947
01:13:05.667 --> 01:13:06.934
I'll play their little game.

1948
01:13:07.066 --> 01:13:08.600
I mean. sure it'll kill
a piece of my soul. but-

1949
01:13:08.734 --> 01:13:10.767
- I'm not talking
about the show.

1950
01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:12.734
I'm talking about
Marco and Luke.

1951
01:13:16.033 --> 01:13:17.967
- Maybe it doesn't have to be.

1952
01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:18.934
- What do you mean?

1953
01:13:19.066 --> 01:13:20.233
- Maybe it's time
we give them a dose

1954
01:13:20.367 --> 01:13:21.934
of their own reality.

1955
01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:39.066
(blow dryer humming)
(knocking on door)

1956
01:13:45.567 --> 01:13:47.967
- So what's all this about?

1957
01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:49.867
- I've been thinking a
lot about the alliance

1958
01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:50.934
you talked about earlier.

1959
01:13:51.066 --> 01:13:52.934
- You're a little late
for that one. sweetie.

1960
01:13:53.066 --> 01:13:56.500
- What if it meant I could
guarantee you come out on top.

1961
01:13:56.633 --> 01:13:57.667
- Interesting.

1962
01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:01.166
But how do I know that this
isn't some sort of trick?

1963
01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:03.533
- I think this will
prove I'm serious.

1964
01:14:03.667 --> 01:14:04.600
I was saving it for myself.

1965
01:14:04.734 --> 01:14:07.266
but to be honest. it'll
look better on you.

1966
01:14:09.233 --> 01:14:10.266
- I'm listening.

1967
01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:18.066
- [Hayley] Marie. do you copy?

1968
01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:19.033
I'm in need of assistance.

1969
01:14:19.166 --> 01:14:20.200
Repeat. Do you copy?

1970
01:14:20.333 --> 01:14:22.066
This is Curious. Over.

1971
01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:24.500
- One. how'd you get
a walkie and two.

1972
01:14:24.633 --> 01:14:25.600
this better be good.

1973
01:14:25.734 --> 01:14:26.533

This is our last day.

1990
01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:18.734
so let's finish strong. okay?

1991
01:15:18.867 --> 01:15:21.100
I know that we all really
need a break after this.

1992
01:15:21.233 --> 01:15:23.400
but let's not forget why we
got into this business. okay.

1993
01:15:23.533 --> 01:15:24.400
Let's roll cameras.

1994
01:15:24.533 --> 01:15:25.367
- Rolling!

1995
01:15:28.133 --> 01:15:29.834
- Waiting on you. Luke.

1996
01:15:29.967 --> 01:15:32.467
- And action.

1997
01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:34.333
- Aloha and welcome
to the episode

1998
01:15:34.467 --> 01:15:36.066
you've all been waiting for.

1999
01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:39.133
where Marco will make a Heart
Choice for the last time.

2000
01:15:39.266 --> 01:15:41.233
Are you ready to decide?

2001
01:15:41.367 --> 01:15:42.400
- Absolutely.

2002
01:15:42.533 --> 01:15:44.233
- Let's bring out our ladies.

2003
01:15:44.367 --> 01:15:47.266
(dramatic music)

2004
01:15:52.567 --> 01:15:53.900
- Wow.

2005
01:15:54.033 --> 01:15:56.066
- You want to tell
me what's going on?

2006
01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:57.200
- Nope.

2007
01:16:01.533 --> 01:16:04.500
- Vanessa. You look stunning.

2008
01:16:04.633 --> 01:16:05.867
May I ask who you're wearing?

2009
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.166
- Of course.

2010
01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:09.133
This is a dress
from Silver Halo.

2011
01:16:09.266 --> 01:16:11.700
my new favorite brand
from my favorite designer.

2012
01:16:11.834 --> 01:16:12.934
- I can see why.

2013
01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:15.500
And Hayley. Wow.

2014
01:16:15.633 --> 01:16:17.300
I did say you could wear
whatever you wanted.

2015
01:16:17.433 --> 01:16:19.200
but I see you took
it quite literally.

2016
01:16:19.333 --> 01:16:20.734
May I ask why you chose that?

2017
01:16:20.867 --> 01:16:23.166
- I'd tell you. but
it's a surprise.

2018
01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:24.867
- You know. I don't
like surprises.

2019
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.066
- Yeah. you'll see soon enough.

2020
01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:27.000
(Hayley laughs)

2021
01:16:27.133 --> 01:16:27.834
- Okay.

2022
01:16:27.967 --> 01:16:28.834
Well then.

2023
01:16:28.967 --> 01:16:30.233
let's get to it shall we.

2024
01:16:30.367 --> 01:16:33.266
Marco. make a Heart Choice.

2025
01:16:40.433 --> 01:16:41.367
- Vanessa...

2026
01:16:46.367 --> 01:16:50.133
we might not have had as much
in common out of the gate.

2027
01:16:50.266 --> 01:16:54.367
but the one thing that I
noticed in you was consistency.

2028
01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:57.900
You never wavered in
you're interest in me

2029
01:16:58.934 --> 01:17:00.100
and that gives me the confidence

2030
01:17:00.233 --> 01:17:03.066
that you will always
be in my corner.

2031
01:17:05.266 --> 01:17:06.633
I'm not ready to
propose to you today.

2032
01:17:06.767 --> 01:17:09.500
but I hope that you
will accept this heart

2033
01:17:10.934 --> 01:17:12.767
and continue on this
journey with me.

2034
01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:15.767
- Marco. I'd love to.

2035
01:17:18.066 --> 01:17:19.667
but unfortunately I can't.

2036
01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:24.433
You see. I agree with
everything that you said.

2037
01:17:24.567 --> 01:17:27.500
I have been unwavering
in my interest in you.

2038
01:17:27.633 --> 01:17:30.300
but I deserve a man who
feels the same way about me.

2039
01:17:31.867 --> 01:17:34.467
It's clear to me that your
heart is with someone else.

2040
01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:39.500
(sobbing) Will I ever get
a real chance at love?

2041
01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:46.500
(horse neighing)

2042
01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:53.600
- Bree has a lot to say
about what you saw yesterday.

2043
01:17:53.734 --> 01:17:55.333
I hope you'll give her
the chance to explain.

2044
01:17:55.467 --> 01:17:57.266
I know she would do
the same for you.

2045
01:17:58.533 --> 01:17:59.767
- Do you know where
I can find her?

2046
01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:01.867
- No. but she says that you do.

2047
01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:05.700
Take Duke. he's a lot
faster than a golf cart.

2048
01:18:05.834 --> 01:18:08.934
(gentle upbeat music)

2049
01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.166
- What are we doing here?

2050
01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:17.567
Follow the horse!

2051
01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:20.500
- You heard the
woman. Let's move!

2052
01:18:23.166 --> 01:18:25.700
- Looks like you're gonna
need these more than I will.

2053
01:18:25.834 --> 01:18:27.500
- Bout time you realized that.

2054
01:18:28.967 --> 01:18:30.166
- You're gonna be great.

2055
01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:31.233
- You know I don't do feelings.

2056
01:18:31.367 --> 01:18:34.000
Come on.
(Luke laughs)

2057
01:18:34.133 --> 01:18:36.233
Oscar! My cart
better be loaded up!

2058
01:18:36.367 --> 01:18:37.400
Let's go!

2059
01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:49.500
(romantic music)
(horse neighing)

2060
01:18:58.600 --> 01:18:59.867
- I'm so sorry. Marco.

2061
01:19:00.066 --> 01:19:01.066
I didn't mean to hurt you.

2062
01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:04.934
I just never thought I'd
actually find something real

2063
01:19:05.066 --> 01:19:06.233
on a show like this.

2064
01:19:06.367 --> 01:19:07.100
- It's okay.

2065
01:19:08.433 --> 01:19:09.700
Maybe it's one of those
things you can't find

2066
01:19:09.834 --> 01:19:11.433
until you stop looking for it.

2067
01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:17.066
(romantic music)

2068
01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:29.633
- [Hayley] Woo.

2069
01:19:29.767 --> 01:19:30.934
Ahchoo!

2070
01:19:31.066 --> 01:19:33.066
- Whoa. Gesundheit.

2071
01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:35.400
You weren't kidding about
that horse allergy. were you?

2072
01:19:35.533 --> 01:19:36.467
- Oh. I was not.

2073
01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:37.767
It is a very good thing

2074
01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:39.266
that wardrobe had
that laying around.

2075
01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:40.467
- Yeah. I mean. it
definitely made an impression

2076
01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:41.800
that's for sure.

2077
01:19:43.567 --> 01:19:44.767
I have to ask...

2078
01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:47.467
out of everything that
you just pulled off.

2079
01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:49.400
how did you get Vanessa onboard?

2080
01:19:49.533 --> 01:19:50.967
- Uh. I kind of convinced her

2081
01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:52.133
that she'd be the
next Queen of Hearts

2082
01:19:52.266 --> 01:19:54.800
and promised her custom
dresses for the whole season.

2083
01:19:54.934 --> 01:19:56.400
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

2084
01:19:56.533 --> 01:19:58.467
- Well. if that's not going
above and beyond for your brand.

2085
01:19:58.600 --> 01:19:59.600
I don't know what it is.

2086
01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:04.200
- I gotta say this reality
stuff is exhausting.

2087
01:20:04.333 --> 01:20:06.033
I don't know how you do it.

2088
01:20:06.166 --> 01:20:07.633
- You mean did it?

2089
01:20:07.767 --> 01:20:09.734
Yeah. today was my last day.

2090
01:20:09.867 --> 01:20:11.900
Successful or not. I
can't do it anymore.

2091
01:20:12.767 --> 01:20:14.266
And I look at you and you know.

2092
01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:19.400
I see that you're genuine
and passionate and real...

2093
01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:22.900
and that's who I want to be.

2094
01:20:24.233 --> 01:20:25.934
And it's who I want to be with.

2095
01:20:26.066 --> 01:20:27.567
- Wow. hold up.

2096
01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:29.033
you can't give out
hearts just yet.

2097
01:20:29.166 --> 01:20:30.767
we haven't even been
on an official date.

2098
01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:32.367
- Maybe we can change that

2099
01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:34.900
since I'll be spending
more time in the Bay Area.

2100
01:20:35.033 --> 01:20:36.200
- Wait. why?

2101
01:20:36.333 --> 01:20:37.100
- San Francisco's
my favorite city

2102
01:20:37.233 --> 01:20:39.767
and it happens to
be a good place

2103
01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:41.400
to start off my docu-series.

2104
01:20:41.533 --> 01:20:43.433
- You know. what's weird
is it also happens to be

2105
01:20:43.567 --> 01:20:44.734
the place where I live.

2106
01:20:44.867 --> 01:20:46.200
- Is it? Did you mention that?

2107
01:20:46.333 --> 01:20:47.400
- Maybe once or twice?

2108
01:20:47.533 --> 01:20:48.433
- I swear. I didn't know.

2109
01:20:48.567 --> 01:20:49.934
(Hayley laughs)

2110
01:20:50.066 --> 01:20:51.500
- I think it's a great idea.

2111
01:20:52.867 --> 01:20:55.266
- Well. I may not be moving
mountains to be near you.

2112
01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:56.767
but I am crossing an ocean.

2113
01:20:56.900 --> 01:20:58.600
So I hope that still counts.

2114
01:20:58.734 --> 01:20:59.967
- I can work with that.

2115
01:21:01.066 --> 01:21:02.133
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

2116
01:21:02.266 --> 01:21:05.333
♪ Love is where you are ♪

2117
01:21:05.467 --> 01:21:09.367
♪ Just know that love
is wherever you are ♪

2118
01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:13.333
♪ It will never be too far ♪

2119
01:21:13.467 --> 01:21:15.467
♪ Oh no ♪

2120
01:21:19.834 --> 01:21:23.033
(gentle upbeat music)
