<i>Contact and capture confirmed.</i>

4
00:08:54.952 --> 00:08:55.786
Hello.

5
00:09:00.249 --> 00:09:02.918
I hear we'll be working closely.

6
00:21:29.247 --> 00:21:31.874
<i>ISS Crew requesting information
from the ground.</i>

7
00:21:46.264 --> 00:21:49.225
I have to know if the kids are okay.

8
00:22:29.724 --> 00:22:31.017
Any news from the United States?

9
00:22:32.018 --> 00:22:32.852
Not yet.

10
00:22:34.896 --> 00:22:36.731
You nervous?

11
00:22:46.866 --> 00:22:50.286
I have a bottle of vodka taped under
the SSRMS control console.

12
00:23:01.005 --> 00:23:02.298
Thank you.

13
00:47:07.116 --> 00:47:08.326
What...

14
00:47:10.286 --> 00:47:12.539
What happened? Lyosha?

15
00:47:13.498 --> 00:47:14.290
Kolya?

16
00:47:17.877 --> 00:47:19.587
You wouldn't have wanted to know.

17
00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:21.923
I don't understand.

18
00:47:23.424 --> 00:47:25.051
I didn't know...

19
00:47:25.885 --> 00:47:27.804
Nicholai promised.

20
00:47:29.264 --> 00:47:32.559
Before the radios failed...

21
00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:35.270
We received orders from the ground.

22
00:47:37.188 --> 00:47:41.067
There's a war between us
and the Americans.

23
00:47:41.693 --> 00:47:44.362
We have been told...

24
00:47:47.031 --> 00:47:49.617
We have been told to take the ISS.

25
00:47:50.034 --> 00:47:51.744
At all costs.

26
00:47:52.829 --> 00:47:54.831
I replaced it with a dummy wire.

27
00:47:55.164 --> 00:47:55.957
What?

28
00:47:56.082 --> 00:47:57.584
No one will know.

29
00:47:58.543 --> 00:47:59.460
No...

30
00:48:00.837 --> 00:48:03.381
I didn't know what Nicholai
was going to do.

31
00:48:03.506 --> 00:48:04.841
Tell her.

32
00:48:04.966 --> 00:48:06.134
No. Lyosha.

33
00:48:06.718 --> 00:48:08.469
Tell her!

34
00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:10.555
Nicholai!

35
00:48:16.728 --> 00:48:19.939
It was just supposed to cut off
their communication.

36
00:48:20.648 --> 00:48:22.400
Look at me.

37
00:48:23.568 --> 00:48:25.570
You can't have thought--

38
00:48:27.947 --> 00:48:29.115
I'm sorry.

39
00:48:30.074 --> 00:48:31.367
I don't want your sorry.

40
00:48:31.492 --> 00:48:34.037
Weronika. they were going to do it to us.

41
00:48:34.621 --> 00:48:37.290
We have to assume this.

42
00:48:38.124 --> 00:48:40.168
You're a monster. Nicholai.

43
00:48:42.045 --> 00:48:43.588
Yeah. I'm a monster...

44
00:48:43.921 --> 00:48:46.007
I understand why you'd say that.

45
00:48:46.591 --> 00:48:49.719
Sorry you don't want to hear that
right now. but it's the truth.

46
00:48:52.639 --> 00:48:53.973
You're my friend.

47
00:48:56.225 --> 00:48:57.769
He's not dead.

48
00:48:59.228 --> 00:49:00.271
He's not dead.

49
00:49:02.273 --> 00:49:04.817
Lyosha. he's not dead!

50
00:49:04.942 --> 00:49:09.030
If his suit held up. then his life support
should keep him alive until it fails!

51
00:49:09.405 --> 00:49:10.865
Lyosha. please!

52
00:49:11.908 --> 00:49:14.243
If we don't move quickly.

53
00:49:14.369 --> 00:49:16.746
he's going to be drowning out there
for the next eight hours!

54
00:49:16.871 --> 00:49:18.289
We need to try.

55
00:49:24.087 --> 00:49:26.130
I'm telling the Americans.

56
00:49:27.590 --> 00:49:30.343
If you won't help me. they will.

57
00:49:30.468 --> 00:49:31.594
He's gone.

58
00:49:32.512 --> 00:49:34.847
There was no one on the tether. was there?

59
00:49:34.972 --> 00:49:36.724
He must have undone it himself...

60
00:49:36.849 --> 00:49:39.018
We don't have eyes on him anymore. either.

61
00:49:39.644 --> 00:49:40.645
Nika...

62
00:49:41.437 --> 00:49:42.480
It's over.

63
00:49:42.605 --> 00:49:46.484
There are two other Americans on board.
you son of a bitch!

64
00:49:47.068 --> 00:49:49.404
Do you intend to murder them too?

65
00:49:53.491 --> 00:49:56.994
No one deserves what you did to Gordon.

66
00:50:02.375 --> 00:50:04.794
No one.

67
00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:04.190
What are you doing?

68
00:58:08.986 --> 00:58:10.863
Don't you get it?

69
00:58:11.572 --> 00:58:12.823
We're scientists.

70
00:58:13.407 --> 00:58:14.617
We're not dogs.

71
00:58:18.621 --> 00:58:20.206
But if it's this easy to forget...

72
00:58:21.457 --> 00:58:23.459
...what's the difference?

73
00:58:23.584 --> 00:58:24.877
Weronika...

74
00:58:26.128 --> 00:58:28.255
That's pure oxygen in those vents.

75
00:58:31.008 --> 00:58:33.219
If you activate that.
you'll torch the whole station.

76
00:58:34.803 --> 00:58:36.180
Lyosha. get in here!

77
00:58:37.806 --> 00:58:39.975
I understand it's hard for you now.

78
00:58:40.434 --> 00:58:43.354
I know what you're going through.

79
00:58:43.479 --> 00:58:47.024
But we can still talk about this.
can't we?

80
00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:50.653
Listen to me...

81
00:58:50.778 --> 00:58:51.737
Brother...

82
00:58:52.404 --> 00:58:53.280
Nika...

83
00:58:54.156 --> 00:58:55.741
Don't do this.

84
00:58:56.367 --> 00:58:58.410
You don't know what I want.

85
00:58:59.787 --> 00:59:01.330
Gordon knew...

86
00:59:01.830 --> 00:59:03.249
now I know--

87
00:59:04.917 --> 00:59:05.834
Stay away!

88
00:59:07.628 --> 00:59:09.672
- You're going to get us all killed!
- Stay away!

89
00:59:59.138 --> 01:00:00.139
Listen to me.

90
01:00:00.264 --> 01:00:01.390
Why should I?

91
01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:07.313
The important thing is that
we stick together.

92
01:00:14.445 --> 01:00:17.114
Talk to me about your sister.

93
01:00:19.366 --> 01:00:21.160
Her children...

94
01:00:22.328 --> 01:00:23.495
Maxim...

95
01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:26.248
...and Elena.

96
01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:31.962
Don't do this.

97
01:00:32.421 --> 01:00:33.797
Think about them.

98
01:00:33.922 --> 01:00:35.883
I am doing this for them.

99
01:00:36.008 --> 01:00:37.009
Nika...

100
01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:38.635
Stay away!

101
01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:48.687
I understand if I ended
our friendship today.

102
01:00:50.606 --> 01:00:53.650
But I don't believe
you want to hurt anyone.

103
01:00:59.031 --> 01:01:01.283
We can still resolve things peacefully.

104
01:01:01.617 --> 01:01:03.077
- Lyosha.
- Nika.

105
01:01:03.202 --> 01:01:05.537
You were always a good friend.

106
01:01:10.959 --> 01:01:13.003
But I don't believe any of that.

107
01:01:16.298 --> 01:01:17.299
Nika...

108
01:01:20.886 --> 01:01:21.804
Lyosha. I'm so sorry--

109
01:01:38.112 --> 01:01:39.029
Nika!

110
01:01:39.154 --> 01:01:41.073
Come on! Wake up!

111
01:01:41.532 --> 01:01:43.075
Nika. wake up! Wake up!

112
01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.660
Lyosha. get her out of here!

113
01:01:45.953 --> 01:01:47.704
We have to get her out of here!

114
01:03:53.539 --> 01:03:55.374
I'm finishing this.

115
01:03:57.125 --> 01:03:58.877
What does that mean?

116
01:03:59.545 --> 01:04:01.463
You know what it means.

117
01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:06.760
You're not a murderer.

118
01:04:06.885 --> 01:04:08.554
Don't be an idiot.

119
01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:12.015
I'm trying to save lives here.

120
01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:16.019
These people killed our friend.

121
01:04:17.563 --> 01:04:18.605
No...

122
01:04:19.982 --> 01:04:22.067
We killed our friend.

123
01:04:26.572 --> 01:04:28.282
You know Lyosha...

124
01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:32.244
There's a word for that.

125
01:04:33.078 --> 01:04:34.037
What?

126
01:04:35.622 --> 01:04:36.957
Duty.

127
01:04:43.714 --> 01:04:44.840
You...

128
01:04:48.594 --> 01:04:50.679
...are a good son of your country.

129
01:04:52.514 --> 01:04:54.516
A son of your people.

130
01:04:56.143 --> 01:04:57.769
A good son.

131
01:05:01.607 --> 01:05:03.525
You're my brother.

132
01:05:07.195 --> 01:05:08.780
Remember that.

133
01:08:35.445 --> 01:08:36.655
No...

134
01:08:37.322 --> 01:08:39.991
Come on. come on!

135
01:10:30.852 --> 01:10:32.604
Found anyone?

136
01:10:33.855 --> 01:10:35.649
What do you think?

137
01:12:15.915 --> 01:12:18.001
She's gone.

138
01:22:34.784 --> 01:22:38.454
Would you mind giving Dr. Foster and me
a moment in private?

139
01:22:38.871 --> 01:22:42.750
There's something she feels
she needs to tell me.

140
01:22:44.377 --> 01:22:45.753
No offense.

141
01:23:01.769 --> 01:23:03.270
The important thing...

142
01:23:03.396 --> 01:23:06.107
is that we stick together.

143
01:23:14.365 --> 01:23:16.033
The important things...

144
01:23:16.701 --> 01:23:19.704
is that we stick together.

145
01:23:19.829 --> 01:23:22.498
Alexey. a moment please.

146
01:23:30.715 --> 01:23:32.967
I froze the life support...

147
01:23:33.092 --> 01:23:35.094
but I can fix it.

148
01:23:37.596 --> 01:23:40.141
I know how to reverse the process.

149
01:23:49.567 --> 01:23:51.485
So do I.
