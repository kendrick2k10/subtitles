3
00:01:18.904 --> 00:01:19.862
Stop.

4
00:01:19.905 --> 00:01:21.733
Wait. Time out.

5
00:01:26.782 --> 00:01:29.001
Before we get started.
you should know

6
00:01:29.045 --> 00:01:31.917
this is my story
that I had to piece together

7
00:01:31.961 --> 00:01:34.137
from three different
time continuums.

8
00:01:34.181 --> 00:01:37.009
You would never know that
any of this has ever happened

9
00:01:37.053 --> 00:01:39.099
unless you heard it from me.

10
00:01:39.142 --> 00:01:42.928
Because. well.
when time continuums change.

11
00:01:42.972 --> 00:01:46.106
everything changes
and your present time

12
00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:47.716
isn't the same as mine.

13
00:01:48.456 --> 00:01:51.633
Before I enlighten you.
let me ask you something.

14
00:01:53.156 --> 00:01:55.898
What would you do
if you could travel in time?

15
00:01:56.812 --> 00:01:59.249
Would you manipulate
the stock market and get rich?

16
00:02:00.076 --> 00:02:04.559
Or maybe you'd pursue
a more noble purpose
and help those in need?

17
00:02:04.602 --> 00:02:08.258
Would you save people
from natural disasters

18
00:02:08.302 --> 00:02:10.478
or horrible accidents?

19
00:02:10.956 --> 00:02:15.657
Maybe you would say goodbye
to that special loved one

20
00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:20.314
or fix your past mistakes
that hurt yourself or others?

21
00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:23.969
Perhaps you would
sneak a peek at the future?

22
00:02:25.057 --> 00:02:29.323
Would you go back and change
anything about your life

23
00:02:29.714 --> 00:02:33.675
or just accept everything
as God's will?

24
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.506
Some people say that they
wouldn't change anything at all

25
00:02:39.246 --> 00:02:42.162
and that their life
experiences. good and bad.

26
00:02:42.205 --> 00:02:44.512
have made them who they are.

27
00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:48.646
But what if someone else
changed time?

28
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:52.737
What if they went back
and changed a pivotal event

29
00:02:52.781 --> 00:02:56.350
that completely changed
the course of history.

30
00:02:56.872 --> 00:03:02.878
so much so that you and millions
of others never existed?

31
00:03:06.316 --> 00:03:11.191
Three. two. one. Engage.

32
00:03:30.993 --> 00:03:32.255
I've got him.

33
00:03:36.694 --> 00:03:40.220
If you really are
the son of God...

34
00:03:41.612 --> 00:03:43.484
...you can stop these bullets.

35
00:03:49.098 --> 00:03:50.926
This is for taking my family.

36
00:04:09.684 --> 00:04:12.556
That's me. Ram Goldstein.

37
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.559
the most brilliant genius
since Einstein.

38
00:04:15.603 --> 00:04:18.258
I'm not bragging.
it's just fact.

39
00:04:18.954 --> 00:04:21.261
My story is
a little hard to follow

40
00:04:21.304 --> 00:04:24.438
for even the most avid
time traveler fans.

41
00:04:24.481 --> 00:04:28.398
but don't be disheartened.
I'll help you follow along.

42
00:04:29.486 --> 00:04:31.314
When two quantum objects photons

43
00:04:31.358 --> 00:04:32.620
share the same wave functions

44
00:04:32.663 --> 00:04:33.925
and occupy the same
space and time.

45
00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:36.276
they are... identical.

46
00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:39.801
What happens to one. in theory.
would happen to the other.

47
00:04:40.454 --> 00:04:42.282
Yes. Oh. sorry.

48
00:04:42.717 --> 00:04:44.022
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

49
00:04:46.416 --> 00:04:47.722
That's Amy.

50
00:04:47.765 --> 00:04:49.419
She's a genius too!

51
00:04:49.463 --> 00:04:52.074
It was love at first sight.

52
00:04:52.901 --> 00:04:53.815
Stay.

53
00:04:55.338 --> 00:04:58.254
Okay. well. at least it was
for one of us.

54
00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:02.563
Back to Amy. we actually
fell in love in my basement.

55
00:05:02.606 --> 00:05:05.174
I won her over
with my flair for fashion.

56
00:05:05.217 --> 00:05:09.657
incredibly good looks.
and my dancing skills.

57
00:05:13.051 --> 00:05:15.358
I'm really sorry.
I get hyper focused

58
00:05:15.402 --> 00:05:17.578
and sometimes self-absorbed.

59
00:05:18.361 --> 00:05:20.624
I get it. That might have been

60
00:05:20.668 --> 00:05:22.626
the toughest test
I've ever taken.

61
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.062
Pretty sure I aced it.

62
00:05:24.498 --> 00:05:27.239
No one's ever
going to ace this test.

63
00:05:27.283 --> 00:05:28.197
I'll be the first.

64
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.590
Oh. really?

65
00:05:29.633 --> 00:05:30.982
And just who are you?

66
00:05:31.026 --> 00:05:32.593
Ram Goldstein.

67
00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:34.464
Amy Lee.

68
00:05:35.378 --> 00:05:36.988
If you're so brilliantly smart.

69
00:05:37.032 --> 00:05:38.512
how come I've
never heard of you?

70
00:05:38.555 --> 00:05:41.384
I graduated MIT
over five years ago.

71
00:05:41.428 --> 00:05:43.386
I do contract work
out of my basement.

72
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.127
So you live with your parents?

73
00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:49.827
Well. it's kind of like
a financial arrangement.

74
00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:51.438
um. more like they live with me.

75
00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:54.136
Well. maybe if you're
in the top four scores.

76
00:05:54.179 --> 00:05:57.705
you can make
half a million a year.
you can afford to move out.

77
00:05:57.748 --> 00:05:59.402
It's actually reduction
in my income.

78
00:05:59.446 --> 00:06:01.970
but I'm fascinated
by the prospect.

79
00:06:02.013 --> 00:06:02.971
Hmm.

80
00:06:04.451 --> 00:06:07.410
Bet you dinner tonight
you didn't ace the test. Deal?

81
00:06:07.454 --> 00:06:09.499
Yes. No. I mean.

82
00:06:09.543 --> 00:06:11.458
the scores won't
be tabulated until next week.

83
00:06:11.501 --> 00:06:15.113
-we won't be able to--
-Ram. it wasn't really
about the scores.

84
00:06:17.594 --> 00:06:18.943
And you're buying.

85
00:06:25.036 --> 00:06:27.952
That's Brandt.
He was a real bad ass.

86
00:06:27.996 --> 00:06:30.955
a decorated war hero
that single-handedly saved

87
00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:33.523
15 hostages
from an overrun embassy.

88
00:06:33.567 --> 00:06:37.701
But. right after that.
he retired and became
a family man.

89
00:06:37.745 --> 00:06:40.095
Now he's a security director
at the facility.

90
00:06:42.793 --> 00:06:46.188
You may not be saving the world.
but you're a hero to them.

91
00:06:47.494 --> 00:06:49.931
And you're my hero too. darling.

92
00:06:52.455 --> 00:06:53.978
That British accent.

93
00:06:58.505 --> 00:07:01.333
Hey. you okay?

94
00:07:01.377 --> 00:07:05.642
I'm having this feeling

95
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:08.950
that God is going
to do something...

96
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.388
...really miraculous
through you.

97
00:08:09.227 --> 00:08:11.360
No--

98
00:08:29.247 --> 00:08:31.467
It took them three months
to make the announcement.

99
00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:34.078
-but we're finally famous!
-Oh. yeah. about time

100
00:08:34.122 --> 00:08:35.950
somebody recognized
my greatness.

101
00:08:35.993 --> 00:08:37.691
You mean. besides yourself?

102
00:08:37.734 --> 00:08:38.953
That's Simon.

103
00:08:38.996 --> 00:08:40.911
He's my best genius friend.

104
00:08:40.955 --> 00:08:42.522
He's funny and cool.

105
00:08:42.565 --> 00:08:45.742
but his attitude gets us
into a lot of trouble.

106
00:08:45.786 --> 00:08:46.874
There's a picture!

107
00:08:47.831 --> 00:08:48.963
They made me hide Happy.

108
00:08:49.006 --> 00:08:50.442
That's Felix.

109
00:08:50.486 --> 00:08:52.575
He's your stereotype genius.

110
00:08:52.619 --> 00:08:56.231
Even carries around
a stuffed penguin called Happy.

111
00:08:56.274 --> 00:08:58.668
This is gonna look great
on our résumés.

112
00:08:58.712 --> 00:09:01.584
We won't be needing résumés
if we can't get this completed.

113
00:09:02.063 --> 00:09:03.717
How about getting back to work?

114
00:09:04.979 --> 00:09:06.937
Ram. if you're
the smartest dude in the world.

115
00:09:07.416 --> 00:09:09.374
how come you can't figure out
that we just need to chill out

116
00:09:09.418 --> 00:09:12.247
-every now--
-Simon. can you focus
for just a few minutes?

117
00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:13.988
I really need to test
this algorithm.

118
00:09:14.031 --> 00:09:16.425
You always got
some big new idea.

119
00:09:16.468 --> 00:09:20.342
a bunch of flashing lights
and nothing moves.

120
00:09:22.649 --> 00:09:24.520
I bet you a steak dinner
nothing happens.

121
00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:25.739
Don't be messing around.

122
00:09:25.782 --> 00:09:27.523
The one time
this works and boom.

123
00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:30.482
you're molecules
will be splattered
all over the universe.

124
00:09:30.526 --> 00:09:31.571
Clear.

125
00:09:34.399 --> 00:09:35.966
Seriously. Simon. clear!

126
00:09:42.059 --> 00:09:43.670
-The chair!

127
00:09:43.713 --> 00:09:44.801
It ain't going nowhere.

128
00:09:44.845 --> 00:09:46.673
Put the rubber ball on the pad.

129
00:09:46.716 --> 00:09:48.849
Remember. we get
a two million dollar bonus

130
00:09:48.892 --> 00:09:50.372
if we get this thing to work.

131
00:09:50.415 --> 00:09:51.939
Transport the chair!

132
00:09:56.247 --> 00:09:58.685
Every time you pray
and nothing ever happens.

133
00:09:58.728 --> 00:10:00.382
-Don't mock me.
-You're right.

134
00:10:00.425 --> 00:10:02.471
I'm sorry. Just because
I believe in science

135
00:10:02.514 --> 00:10:04.604
doesn't give me the right
to make fun of your belief.

136
00:10:04.647 --> 00:10:06.736
God works in mysterious ways.

137
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.043
And he might
just be working through you.

138
00:10:09.086 --> 00:10:10.566
Have you ever thought
about that?

139
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.176
Yeah. For about this long.

140
00:10:13.787 --> 00:10:15.397
Okay. let's give it a shot.

141
00:10:16.528 --> 00:10:17.486
Come on. steak dinner.

142
00:10:30.804 --> 00:10:31.761
Get down!

143
00:10:54.175 --> 00:10:55.872
Daddy. look at that one!

144
00:10:55.916 --> 00:10:57.395
Looks like an elephant!

145
00:10:57.918 --> 00:10:59.659
God...

146
00:11:00.747 --> 00:11:01.661
why?

147
00:11:37.609 --> 00:11:39.002
But I served you.

148
00:11:40.221 --> 00:11:42.658
I played this life
by your rules.

149
00:11:43.354 --> 00:11:46.096
I've done everything
that you've ever asked me.

150
00:11:47.228 --> 00:11:51.101
You take my family.
What kind of God are you?

151
00:11:56.193 --> 00:11:58.500
-

152
00:12:02.983 --> 00:12:04.288
You're nasty.

153
00:12:05.812 --> 00:12:07.552
Can I at least get cleaned up?

154
00:12:07.596 --> 00:12:09.119
You are not to speak to anyone

155
00:12:09.598 --> 00:12:11.818
or leave this area
until Ahmed arrives.

156
00:12:11.861 --> 00:12:14.168
This is so bad.
Ahmed himself is coming.

157
00:12:14.603 --> 00:12:17.780
Less than three months
on the job and we are toast.

158
00:12:18.433 --> 00:12:20.087
At least we're alive.

159
00:12:20.914 --> 00:12:22.698
This was a good gig for me.

160
00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:24.308
I'm sorry. guys. this is on me.

161
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.398
I'll take the blame and maybe
they'll keep you guys on board.

162
00:12:27.442 --> 00:12:30.488
Blowing up a lab
doesn't necessarily mean
we're being fired. right?

163
00:12:31.315 --> 00:12:34.275
I mean. it's what
scientists do sometimes.

164
00:12:34.623 --> 00:12:37.060
Hey. don't worry. Ram.

165
00:12:37.626 --> 00:12:38.758
Ahmed is a good man.

166
00:12:39.454 --> 00:12:42.283
He always takes
care of his people. eh.

167
00:12:50.682 --> 00:12:52.336
You guys blew up my lab.

168
00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.816
-It was my fault.

169
00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.339
I should've followed
the protocol.

170
00:12:55.905 --> 00:12:59.082
I accept the consequences
for my actions.

171
00:12:59.604 --> 00:13:01.215
Ram Goldstein.

172
00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:03.434
the man who aced my test.

173
00:13:04.261 --> 00:13:06.307
It makes perfect sense
that you would do this.

174
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:08.396
And they didn't know
what I was doing.

175
00:13:10.702 --> 00:13:13.793
Maybe you should tell me
what the consequences should be.

176
00:13:14.706 --> 00:13:16.143
Watch this video and tell me

177
00:13:16.578 --> 00:13:18.710
exactly how you think
I should handle this.

178
00:13:18.754 --> 00:13:19.799
Press play.

179
00:13:24.891 --> 00:13:26.414
It moved to the other pad!

180
00:13:26.457 --> 00:13:28.764
Two quantum objects
occupying the same wave

181
00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:30.287
should co-exist.

182
00:13:30.331 --> 00:13:32.376
What happens to one
happens to the other.

183
00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.596
-Both chairs were--
-You four have done something

184
00:13:34.639 --> 00:13:36.250
in less than three months

185
00:13:36.293 --> 00:13:38.992
that none of my best teams
have been able to do in years.

186
00:13:39.035 --> 00:13:41.037
-Sabeer.

187
00:13:41.081 --> 00:13:44.084
seal this room exactly as it is.

188
00:13:44.693 --> 00:13:46.390
This is history in the making.

189
00:13:46.913 --> 00:13:51.352
You four will be famous
for creating matter transfer.

190
00:13:52.005 --> 00:13:55.008
Follow me.
You are now my top team.

191
00:13:57.401 --> 00:13:59.142
Happy. we're gonna be famous!

192
00:13:59.186 --> 00:14:00.448
Hey. Ram? You know I was kidding

193
00:14:00.491 --> 00:14:01.449
about that steak dinner. right?

194
00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:15.376
Oh. snaps! This is nice!

195
00:14:15.767 --> 00:14:17.378
This is your new home.

196
00:14:17.421 --> 00:14:19.032
You'll have the finest equipment

197
00:14:19.075 --> 00:14:21.817
and all the resources you need
to pull this off.

198
00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:24.733
and there will be a ten million
dollar bonus for each of you.

199
00:14:24.776 --> 00:14:26.909
Oh. I'm down for that.

200
00:14:26.953 --> 00:14:28.389
Each? Let's get started.

201
00:14:28.432 --> 00:14:30.478
I think a shower is in order.

202
00:14:30.521 --> 00:14:32.828
And then take
the rest of the evening off.

203
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.439
You expect Ram
to take the night off?

204
00:14:35.483 --> 00:14:37.789
That would be great.
wouldn't it. Ram?

205
00:14:37.833 --> 00:14:41.010
-Or we could
start getting to work now.
-

206
00:14:41.924 --> 00:14:43.230
It's a big project. Uh...

207
00:14:43.752 --> 00:14:45.058
Okay. we'll take the night off.

208
00:14:47.843 --> 00:14:49.105
- Come in.

209
00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:56.025
Reporting for duty. sir.

210
00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:58.723
Captain Brandt.
Please. sit down.

211
00:15:01.857 --> 00:15:04.729
Again. we're sorry for the loss
of your wife and daughters.

212
00:15:04.773 --> 00:15:05.948
Yeah.

213
00:15:05.992 --> 00:15:07.602
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

214
00:15:12.085 --> 00:15:13.695
It's only been a few weeks.

215
00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:16.785
-Don't you need
some more time off?
-If it's alright with you. sir.

216
00:15:16.828 --> 00:15:17.829
-I'd prefer to stay busy.
-

217
00:15:17.873 --> 00:15:19.092
Enter!

218
00:15:21.572 --> 00:15:23.923
What do you need me to do
about the explosion?

219
00:15:23.966 --> 00:15:25.576
I've got it handled.

220
00:15:26.186 --> 00:15:28.144
Sabeer. I wasn't talking to you.

221
00:15:28.623 --> 00:15:31.365
Look. we're on the verge
of something big.

222
00:15:31.408 --> 00:15:34.020
Nothing is more important than
the secrecy of this project.

223
00:15:34.063 --> 00:15:35.673
I'll make sure
that it stays secure.

224
00:15:36.413 --> 00:15:38.763
Did you hire the security team
that I advised?

225
00:15:38.807 --> 00:15:40.243
-Yes.
-Perfect.

226
00:15:40.287 --> 00:15:42.593
I'll take over
coordinating them with our team.

227
00:15:42.637 --> 00:15:43.551
That's fine.

228
00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:44.944
I just don't want them knowing

229
00:15:44.987 --> 00:15:46.206
anything about our project.

230
00:15:46.771 --> 00:15:47.859
Keep them on the perimeter.

231
00:15:48.599 --> 00:15:50.688
Seriously.
take all the time you need.

232
00:15:51.124 --> 00:15:52.690
It is important to grieve.

233
00:15:55.389 --> 00:15:57.652
The more time I take
to think about it...

234
00:16:00.089 --> 00:16:02.004
...the angrier I get with God.

235
00:16:02.048 --> 00:16:03.397
Because he did not stop it?

236
00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:07.096
He didn't stop it.
Caused it. allowed it.

237
00:16:08.054 --> 00:16:09.229
It doesn't really matter.

238
00:16:11.535 --> 00:16:13.537
My family is dead
and he did nothing.

239
00:16:14.582 --> 00:16:16.497
No father
should ever have to bury...

240
00:16:17.628 --> 00:16:20.718
-...his own children--
-Again. we're sorry
for your loss.

241
00:16:21.937 --> 00:16:25.985
I felt the same way
when I lost my parents.

242
00:16:26.681 --> 00:16:28.770
-

243
00:16:29.205 --> 00:16:30.815
Father God.

244
00:16:30.859 --> 00:16:32.034
have mercy.

245
00:16:32.687 --> 00:16:34.471
No! No. no!

246
00:16:34.515 --> 00:16:36.212
No! Mom!

247
00:16:36.256 --> 00:16:38.084
-No! No!
-

248
00:16:42.175 --> 00:16:44.394
-

249
00:16:57.842 --> 00:16:59.061
Bring him.

250
00:16:59.975 --> 00:17:01.020
He will pay for this.

251
00:17:02.412 --> 00:17:03.239
If it's alright with you.
sir. can we--

252
00:17:03.283 --> 00:17:04.545
can we please move on?

253
00:17:05.546 --> 00:17:06.764
Sure.

254
00:17:07.504 --> 00:17:09.463
While you were away.
I put Sabeer in charge.

255
00:17:09.506 --> 00:17:11.378
Let's keep it that way
for a few weeks.

256
00:17:11.421 --> 00:17:13.032
That way you can come
and go without stress.

257
00:17:13.075 --> 00:17:14.337
Sir. I don't think it's smart

258
00:17:14.381 --> 00:17:15.817
to have Sabeer
in charge of anything.

259
00:17:17.123 --> 00:17:19.429
-Ever.
-It's only for a few more weeks.

260
00:17:20.735 --> 00:17:21.649
You're the boss.

261
00:17:43.627 --> 00:17:46.717
This is
a lot harder than I thought.

262
00:17:47.762 --> 00:17:51.244
It's only been a few weeks.
Don't be so hard on yourself.

263
00:17:56.292 --> 00:18:00.601
You know. I think
I might know the problem.

264
00:18:09.827 --> 00:18:11.220
Come look at this.

265
00:18:18.967 --> 00:18:20.316
Hey. Hey!

266
00:18:26.279 --> 00:18:27.584
What are they doing?

267
00:18:30.979 --> 00:18:33.199
Working in the server room
is my favorite part of the day.

268
00:18:33.242 --> 00:18:34.461
So this is work?

269
00:18:34.504 --> 00:18:35.984
Don't twist my words.

270
00:18:36.027 --> 00:18:37.246
you know what I mean.

271
00:18:37.768 --> 00:18:39.030
Seriously.

272
00:18:39.074 --> 00:18:40.423
why do we have to hide?

273
00:18:40.467 --> 00:18:43.992
There are cameras
and microphones everywhere.

274
00:18:44.035 --> 00:18:45.211
it's just awkward.

275
00:18:46.951 --> 00:18:48.039
Get some mics in there.

276
00:18:49.606 --> 00:18:51.347
-I want to know
what they're saying.
- Okay.

277
00:19:04.273 --> 00:19:06.362
-That's perplexing.
-What?

278
00:19:07.102 --> 00:19:08.625
I'm about to find out.

279
00:19:10.018 --> 00:19:11.150
What are you doing?

280
00:19:12.238 --> 00:19:13.369
Someone's using a secure line

281
00:19:13.413 --> 00:19:15.415
to communicate with the outside.

282
00:19:15.458 --> 00:19:16.894
I'm gonna find out who.

283
00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:21.072
Oh my gosh.
-That's Rashaad Amir.

284
00:19:21.116 --> 00:19:24.337
Rashaad Amir is the most wanted
terrorist in the world.

285
00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:28.819
-He orchestrated the attack
of 12 embassies in one day.
-Give me a progress report.

286
00:19:28.863 --> 00:19:31.822
We can use it in its current
state. but it's not stable.

287
00:19:31.866 --> 00:19:34.782
How is the situation
with the American?

288
00:19:34.825 --> 00:19:37.088
-He's under control.
-

289
00:19:37.132 --> 00:19:40.309
Everything explodes
when you transfer it.

290
00:19:40.353 --> 00:19:41.832
Isn't that what we want?

291
00:19:41.876 --> 00:19:44.705
Yes. But if these kids
keep doing their job.

292
00:19:44.748 --> 00:19:48.535
it won't be long
before we can transfer
supplies. bombs and more.

293
00:19:48.578 --> 00:19:50.885
We can strike
any GPS coordinate.

294
00:19:52.539 --> 00:19:55.803
-Make sure you get this right.
-Got it.

295
00:19:56.325 --> 00:19:58.632
Extremists killed
Ahmed's parents.

296
00:19:58.675 --> 00:20:00.242
Why would he work with them?

297
00:20:00.286 --> 00:20:02.288
It must be Stockholm syndrome.

298
00:20:02.331 --> 00:20:03.811
We have to tell the FBI.

299
00:20:03.854 --> 00:20:06.596
Wait. if they find out.
they'll kill us.

300
00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.598
I know they trace
our phone calls and texts.

301
00:20:09.338 --> 00:20:10.644
Just act like nothing happened.

302
00:20:12.298 --> 00:20:13.560
Once we're off the property.
I'll contact Homeland Security.

303
00:20:22.612 --> 00:20:26.225
I'm fried. This is hopeless.

304
00:20:26.268 --> 00:20:28.314
Einstein. test item 435.

305
00:20:29.097 --> 00:20:32.231
-Initiate.
- Initiating transfer.

306
00:20:36.539 --> 00:20:38.846
-I don't know what's wrong.
-What's wrong is
you keep trying

307
00:20:38.889 --> 00:20:41.065
the same equations
over and over again.

308
00:20:41.109 --> 00:20:43.807
Huh? Isn't that
the definition of insanity?

309
00:20:44.591 --> 00:20:45.505
You're right.

310
00:20:46.897 --> 00:20:48.943
Let me see if I can think
of something else to try.

311
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:54.253
Weight. distance.
photons. matter. volume.

312
00:20:54.296 --> 00:20:56.907
Transfer
from there to here

313
00:20:56.951 --> 00:20:59.736
requires energy. wave length.
distance and GPS coordinates.

314
00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:01.390
I've covered every variation.

315
00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:03.131
What's missing?

316
00:21:04.741 --> 00:21:06.787
I carried the ball over

317
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:08.267
and it took--

318
00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:11.966
It's gonna take
a few seconds for the ball...

319
00:21:12.358 --> 00:21:15.012
...to get from there to here.

320
00:21:16.536 --> 00:21:18.581
If I don't compensate
for those seconds.

321
00:21:18.625 --> 00:21:20.017
then I'm trying
to send the ball...

322
00:21:21.845 --> 00:21:23.804
...into the past.

323
00:21:25.588 --> 00:21:27.068
Uh. you guys look fried.

324
00:21:27.111 --> 00:21:27.982
I have an idea.

325
00:21:28.461 --> 00:21:29.984
-Lunchtime!

326
00:21:31.028 --> 00:21:32.421
What? It's only 11!

327
00:21:32.465 --> 00:21:33.727
-Yeah. but--
-Hey!

328
00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:35.816
I'm hungry. aren't you?

329
00:21:36.338 --> 00:21:37.470
Come on. let's go.

330
00:21:38.079 --> 00:21:39.341
Here we go.

331
00:21:40.995 --> 00:21:43.040
I'd like to use the restroom.
I'll meet you guys down there.

332
00:21:47.828 --> 00:21:49.351
What are you doing?

333
00:21:49.395 --> 00:21:51.919
I can do it.
-No. you can't.

334
00:21:53.486 --> 00:21:55.314
Do you know what happens
if you're successful?

335
00:21:55.357 --> 00:21:58.317
Don't worry.
they won't catch me.

336
00:22:00.188 --> 00:22:01.842
Be careful.

337
00:22:14.028 --> 00:22:15.682
Einstein. test item 436.

338
00:22:15.725 --> 00:22:18.075
-Initiate.
-Initiating transfer.

339
00:22:19.207 --> 00:22:20.817
1.45. two seconds.

340
00:22:21.688 --> 00:22:23.777
If I want matter to transfer.
I have to compensate.

341
00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:26.649
I know they're watching me.
so I'll just set the ball

342
00:22:26.693 --> 00:22:28.825
on the outside edge
of the field perimeter

343
00:22:28.869 --> 00:22:31.393
and use a little
unnoticeable eraser

344
00:22:31.437 --> 00:22:33.047
as the real test item.

345
00:22:36.442 --> 00:22:38.400
Einstein. test item 437.

346
00:22:38.879 --> 00:22:41.403
-Initiate.
-Initiating transfer.

347
00:22:56.244 --> 00:22:57.898
He's hiding something.

348
00:22:59.465 --> 00:23:01.162
Get me some more camera angles.

349
00:23:08.256 --> 00:23:09.388
Another one.

350
00:23:23.445 --> 00:23:24.533
Time travel.

351
00:23:40.941 --> 00:23:43.247
Step away from the computer!

352
00:23:43.291 --> 00:23:44.597
He said step away!

353
00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:51.821
You have some explaining to do.

354
00:23:52.866 --> 00:23:55.434
This makes me rather curious.

355
00:23:56.173 --> 00:23:58.567
In my wildest expectations.
I would've never figured

356
00:23:58.611 --> 00:24:00.439
that you would create
time travel.

357
00:24:00.482 --> 00:24:03.137
And yet. somehow you've done it.

358
00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:06.749
My mind is racing
with the possibilities.

359
00:24:07.315 --> 00:24:11.275
You're going to be famous
and very. very rich.

360
00:24:11.667 --> 00:24:12.929
It's not gonna happen.

361
00:24:12.973 --> 00:24:13.843
Look.

362
00:24:13.887 --> 00:24:15.497
You've been working for me.

363
00:24:15.541 --> 00:24:16.846
you've been compensated by me.

364
00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:19.109
Everything you create
belongs to me.

365
00:24:19.153 --> 00:24:21.634
Your contract makes
that very clear.

366
00:24:21.677 --> 00:24:23.810
Transferring matter
was bad enough.

367
00:24:23.853 --> 00:24:25.638
but time travel in your hands...

368
00:24:26.334 --> 00:24:28.771
I guess Sabeer
and Kabil were right.

369
00:24:28.815 --> 00:24:30.599
You've been spying on me.

370
00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:32.949
But don't get me wrong.

371
00:24:33.776 --> 00:24:36.039
All I want is to go back
in time and stop the men

372
00:24:36.083 --> 00:24:38.389
that killed my parents.
Surely you would do the same

373
00:24:38.433 --> 00:24:40.217
if someone killed
your parents. wouldn't you?

374
00:24:40.261 --> 00:24:41.392
Of course.

375
00:24:41.436 --> 00:24:42.829
But changing time would create

376
00:24:42.872 --> 00:24:44.221
an overriding time continuum.

377
00:24:44.265 --> 00:24:46.223
So no one will know
the difference. Who cares?

378
00:24:46.267 --> 00:24:48.835
If you change history
in the slightest way.

379
00:24:48.878 --> 00:24:51.490
you. me.
we might not even exist.

380
00:24:51.533 --> 00:24:53.492
The benefits outweigh the risks.

381
00:24:53.883 --> 00:24:57.191
What if I could kill Hitler
before he came to power?
Wouldn't you do that?

382
00:24:57.234 --> 00:24:59.367
Imagine the world today
without Hitler.

383
00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:02.370
Who's to say the next guy
wouldn't be even more
destructive?

384
00:25:02.413 --> 00:25:05.460
Perhaps Allah wants me
to work through him
to make things right.

385
00:25:05.504 --> 00:25:09.246
Perhaps you can explain
why Allah let Hitler rise
to power in the first place

386
00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:11.597
if he now has to use you
to correct his mistake.

387
00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.163
How dare you insult Allah!

388
00:25:19.866 --> 00:25:21.302
I thought I could be reasonable.

389
00:25:22.956 --> 00:25:25.393
I guess I'll have to resort
to something much more painful.

390
00:25:25.436 --> 00:25:28.048
-It doesn't matter--

391
00:25:29.615 --> 00:25:31.530
Take him
to the confinement room.

392
00:25:31.573 --> 00:25:32.792
I've got to talk to Rashaad.

393
00:25:33.357 --> 00:25:35.882
A time machine
changes everything.

394
00:25:48.242 --> 00:25:51.114
-

395
00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.251
-What? I can't hear you.

396
00:25:58.861 --> 00:26:00.167
If you're gonna gag somebody.

397
00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:01.472
you should probably
tie their hands

398
00:26:01.516 --> 00:26:03.344
behind their backs. imbecile.

399
00:26:04.911 --> 00:26:06.260
-

400
00:26:10.917 --> 00:26:12.396
Come on. come on.
What do we have?

401
00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.441
I can't get anything.

402
00:26:13.484 --> 00:26:15.269
He encrypted and deleted it.

403
00:26:15.748 --> 00:26:17.401
And he shredded it too.

404
00:26:17.445 --> 00:26:18.881
There's no way to get it back.

405
00:26:19.621 --> 00:26:21.580
You're useless! All of you. out!

406
00:26:22.624 --> 00:26:25.714
Go! You too. get out!

407
00:26:34.418 --> 00:26:35.594
Meet me in the warehouse.

408
00:26:35.942 --> 00:26:37.900
Sir. Brandt is on campus.

409
00:26:38.553 --> 00:26:39.598
Bring him.

410
00:26:41.338 --> 00:26:42.383
Brandt.

411
00:26:43.819 --> 00:26:46.605
We have a problem.
Ram is on the contract with us.

412
00:26:46.648 --> 00:26:48.650
Anything he creates
is our property.

413
00:26:48.694 --> 00:26:52.828
He was successful.
but he destroyed the code
and erased the data.

414
00:26:52.872 --> 00:26:54.743
He won't divulge
any information.

415
00:26:54.787 --> 00:26:56.745
It is my intellectual property.

416
00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:58.878
If he gets out.
he can sell it for billions.

417
00:26:58.921 --> 00:27:00.140
We have to stop him.

418
00:27:00.183 --> 00:27:01.402
Tell me what you want me to do.

419
00:27:01.445 --> 00:27:02.882
I need him to talk.

420
00:27:03.622 --> 00:27:05.145
You have the means. right?

421
00:27:05.798 --> 00:27:06.886
I...

422
00:27:09.628 --> 00:27:10.803
I'll get you what you need.

423
00:27:14.371 --> 00:27:17.331
He's not answering.
He's not here.

424
00:27:17.723 --> 00:27:19.333
Something is very wrong.

425
00:27:19.376 --> 00:27:22.205
Don't worry. He's probably
doing a mad scientist thing.

426
00:27:24.991 --> 00:27:26.209
We'll find him.

427
00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:30.518
Good news!

428
00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:33.086
Ram has made
an incredible discovery

429
00:27:33.129 --> 00:27:35.958
and the US Military has
classified it as top secret.

430
00:27:36.002 --> 00:27:37.960
The bad news is
none of you have clearance.

431
00:27:38.004 --> 00:27:40.049
so you'll no longer
be able to work with him.

432
00:27:40.093 --> 00:27:41.703
Is it the matter transfer?

433
00:27:41.747 --> 00:27:43.313
As I said. it is top secret.

434
00:27:43.357 --> 00:27:45.751
Suffice it to say you can
no longer work on this project

435
00:27:45.794 --> 00:27:47.143
until we give you that approval.

436
00:27:47.187 --> 00:27:49.319
What? Are we going to get paid?

437
00:27:49.363 --> 00:27:51.452
Each of you
will receive your bonus.

438
00:27:51.495 --> 00:27:52.496
But let me be clear.

439
00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:54.020
This is classified.

440
00:27:55.848 --> 00:27:58.285
You cannot contact anyone
outside of this institute
for any reason.

441
00:27:58.328 --> 00:28:00.548
You may not leave
until we give you permission.

442
00:28:01.114 --> 00:28:02.724
Right now. you need
to turn in your cell phones

443
00:28:02.768 --> 00:28:04.552
and all other
electronic devices.

444
00:28:04.595 --> 00:28:06.119
Wait. where's Ram?

445
00:28:06.554 --> 00:28:09.731
Don't worry. Ram is working
with the US Military's finest.

446
00:28:09.775 --> 00:28:10.819
He's perfectly safe.

447
00:28:11.602 --> 00:28:13.343
-

448
00:28:15.128 --> 00:28:16.564
-

449
00:28:16.607 --> 00:28:17.696
Tell me!

450
00:28:20.742 --> 00:28:21.961
Progress report.

451
00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:24.441
He's got
some strong convictions.

452
00:28:24.485 --> 00:28:26.748
But I'll get your code. just
a matter of time. he'll break.

453
00:28:26.792 --> 00:28:28.576
Let's see
if we can speed time up.

454
00:28:33.886 --> 00:28:36.018
Sit.
- I seem to recall.

455
00:28:36.062 --> 00:28:37.759
you said if someone
killed your parents.

456
00:28:37.803 --> 00:28:39.979
you would go back
in time to save them.

457
00:28:42.068 --> 00:28:43.852
Any last words for your parents?

458
00:28:46.594 --> 00:28:48.030
-No.
-Just give me

459
00:28:48.074 --> 00:28:49.597
what is rightfully mine

460
00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.381
and everyone walks away.

461
00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:53.819
If I tell you.
you'll still kill us.

462
00:28:55.081 --> 00:28:56.473
It's your choice.

463
00:28:57.257 --> 00:29:00.042
Go ahead and live
and die by your logic.

464
00:29:01.827 --> 00:29:03.524
I didn't sign up for this.

465
00:29:05.265 --> 00:29:06.396
You work for me.

466
00:29:06.919 --> 00:29:08.442
In the hallway. now.

467
00:29:20.454 --> 00:29:22.282
We aren't really going
to kill them.

468
00:29:22.325 --> 00:29:24.980
I'm just being persuasive.
And even if I did.

469
00:29:25.024 --> 00:29:26.939
we can just use the time machine
to bring them back.

470
00:29:26.982 --> 00:29:28.636
-That's the point.
-Time machine?

471
00:29:29.289 --> 00:29:31.334
You're telling me
he invented a time machine?

472
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:35.295
Just give me
a little bit more time.

473
00:29:36.296 --> 00:29:37.950
You've been
through a tough time.

474
00:29:38.689 --> 00:29:39.908
You lost your family.

475
00:29:40.779 --> 00:29:42.084
I understand.

476
00:29:43.042 --> 00:29:45.305
Take your mind off things.
go back to the office.

477
00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:46.828
We'll handle this.

478
00:30:02.888 --> 00:30:07.370
I'm going to kill
your father in seven seconds
if you don't give me the code.

479
00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:11.418
Six. five...

480
00:30:11.897 --> 00:30:14.943
No.
Anything. anything. Please.
-...four. three...

481
00:30:15.509 --> 00:30:18.120
-No. No! No!
-...two. one!

482
00:30:18.164 --> 00:30:19.426
-Shoot the father!
- No!

483
00:30:19.469 --> 00:30:22.255
- No! No!

484
00:30:22.298 --> 00:30:24.126
-Wait. No!
- Ready to talk?

485
00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:26.389
-Or do I kill your mother?
-Fuck--

486
00:30:29.871 --> 00:30:33.353
-Look at me. Ram!
-

487
00:30:33.396 --> 00:30:34.528
Don't worry.

488
00:30:35.137 --> 00:30:37.923
He'll only be dead
in this time continuum.

489
00:30:40.142 --> 00:30:42.405
Five seconds! Four.

490
00:30:42.449 --> 00:30:44.364
three. two...

491
00:30:44.755 --> 00:30:46.366
-...look at them. One.
-No!

492
00:30:46.409 --> 00:30:47.889
Shoot the mother.
-No!

493
00:30:53.373 --> 00:30:55.027
I know your pain.

494
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:58.117
I've been there.
But you can change it all back.

495
00:31:00.249 --> 00:31:02.164
Watching your parents die

496
00:31:02.208 --> 00:31:05.515
was a piece of cake
compared to what's next.

497
00:31:07.474 --> 00:31:08.388
Sabeer.

498
00:31:09.519 --> 00:31:11.217
keep him comfortable
until I return.

499
00:31:32.325 --> 00:31:34.153
This is not my fault.

500
00:31:36.895 --> 00:31:38.679
I am not the bad guy here.

501
00:31:44.424 --> 00:31:46.426
This is because of you. God!

502
00:31:48.776 --> 00:31:51.605
You made me this way.
you put me in this position.

503
00:31:54.434 --> 00:31:56.479
If you want me to believe...

504
00:31:57.567 --> 00:32:01.093
...in you. I need proof.
I need something. anything.

505
00:32:01.484 --> 00:32:05.358
How can I trust in you
if you won't even show up?

506
00:32:12.931 --> 00:32:17.152
Anything that happens
from this moment on...

507
00:32:18.849 --> 00:32:20.025
...that's on you.

508
00:32:21.765 --> 00:32:23.680
It has come to my attention
that you have developed

509
00:32:23.724 --> 00:32:26.379
a bit of an attraction
for your coworker.

510
00:32:28.381 --> 00:32:29.948
You know I won't talk.

511
00:32:29.991 --> 00:32:32.124
Oh. you're mistaken.

512
00:32:32.951 --> 00:32:34.996
I learned this lore of torture.

513
00:32:35.866 --> 00:32:37.259
Day after day.

514
00:32:37.303 --> 00:32:41.133
slowly cutting off pieces
of Amy's beautiful body.

515
00:32:42.482 --> 00:32:45.615
Blinding her beautiful eyes...

516
00:32:46.138 --> 00:32:50.490
-...and eventually
peeling her skin off.
-

517
00:32:50.925 --> 00:32:51.839
Let's see.

518
00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:54.450
Let's start
by sticking an ice pick

519
00:32:54.494 --> 00:32:56.104
into one of Amy's eyes.

520
00:32:56.148 --> 00:32:57.540
How long will you hold out?

521
00:32:57.584 --> 00:33:00.761
Watching your Amy
tortured every day.

522
00:33:00.804 --> 00:33:02.545
knowing that you were the cause.

523
00:33:03.242 --> 00:33:05.113
You have five seconds.

524
00:33:05.157 --> 00:33:08.508
Four. three. two--

525
00:33:08.943 --> 00:33:09.857
Wait!

526
00:33:10.945 --> 00:33:12.816
I don't know
if I can control time.

527
00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:15.297
I have no way of knowing
if I can send humans through it.

528
00:33:15.341 --> 00:33:17.430
If you can't send
humans back in time.

529
00:33:17.473 --> 00:33:19.301
you can never save your parents.

530
00:33:19.345 --> 00:33:23.610
-Three. two--
-Stop! Just stop.

531
00:33:24.785 --> 00:33:27.135
If you let me go back in time
and save my parents.

532
00:33:27.179 --> 00:33:29.050
then I will finish
the time machine.

533
00:33:30.008 --> 00:33:31.792
Just no more violence.

534
00:33:31.835 --> 00:33:34.360
Of course you can save
your parents.

535
00:33:34.403 --> 00:33:37.015
It'll take time.
Different molecular structures

536
00:33:37.058 --> 00:33:38.407
will need to be calibrated.

537
00:33:38.451 --> 00:33:40.322
transferring a human
is gonna be complex.

538
00:33:40.366 --> 00:33:42.107
You have three days.

539
00:33:54.119 --> 00:33:56.860
Try anything
even remotely suspicious

540
00:33:57.339 --> 00:33:59.863
or attempt to let
anyone know what is happening

541
00:33:59.907 --> 00:34:01.387
-and Amy--
-I got it.

542
00:34:03.432 --> 00:34:05.652
This is his home
for the next three days.

543
00:34:06.044 --> 00:34:07.958
Don't ever leave him alone.

544
00:34:08.002 --> 00:34:10.178
Keep the cameras
on him full time.

545
00:34:10.222 --> 00:34:12.876
I want two people
watching him 24/7.

546
00:34:13.399 --> 00:34:15.401
-Got it?
-Yes. sir.

547
00:34:17.925 --> 00:34:19.187
Three days.

548
00:34:20.014 --> 00:34:21.146
No stalling.

549
00:34:21.798 --> 00:34:23.104
And no games.

550
00:34:30.068 --> 00:34:32.157
I know that
once I get this built

551
00:34:32.722 --> 00:34:35.899
they will no longer
have use for Amy. Simon.

552
00:34:35.943 --> 00:34:37.597
Felix or myself.

553
00:34:39.729 --> 00:34:42.471
I'm sure they've already
made plans for us to die

554
00:34:42.515 --> 00:34:45.213
in an unfortunate lab explosion.

555
00:34:46.606 --> 00:34:48.390
I only have one hope.

556
00:34:48.434 --> 00:34:50.436
I have to create
the time machine

557
00:34:50.479 --> 00:34:52.481
without letting them know
it's functional

558
00:34:52.525 --> 00:34:55.049
and then sneak back in time
to change all of this.

559
00:34:55.093 --> 00:34:57.791
But they are watching
my every move.

560
00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:01.838
I'm hoping
that I can bore them to death

561
00:35:01.882 --> 00:35:03.579
or lull them to sleep.

562
00:35:27.299 --> 00:35:28.474
Fire it up.

563
00:35:33.087 --> 00:35:34.958
It's only partially functional.

564
00:35:35.002 --> 00:35:36.830
There are still incongruencies

565
00:35:36.873 --> 00:35:39.659
-and I haven't completed
all the safe--
-Fire it up.

566
00:35:42.227 --> 00:35:44.011
Initiating transfer.

567
00:35:47.188 --> 00:35:48.320
Step up.

568
00:35:50.322 --> 00:35:52.150
But. sir.
maybe the kid should step up

569
00:35:52.193 --> 00:35:55.588
-because he made it
and he might--
-Get on the time pad.

570
00:35:56.197 --> 00:35:57.677
Hang on.
he's gonna need one of these.

571
00:35:58.591 --> 00:36:01.289
Einstein. initiate
timestamp on retriever.

572
00:36:01.333 --> 00:36:03.639
Completed at 11:50 pm.

573
00:36:03.683 --> 00:36:04.597
What's this?

574
00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:05.989
The retrievers are needed

575
00:36:06.033 --> 00:36:08.253
to travel into the past
or the future.

576
00:36:08.296 --> 00:36:09.950
Without one. you can transfer.

577
00:36:09.993 --> 00:36:12.692
but your molecules
will explode within seconds.

578
00:36:13.083 --> 00:36:14.563
It also tracks your vitals.

579
00:36:14.607 --> 00:36:17.175
so if you were to perish.
it would reclaim his body.

580
00:36:17.218 --> 00:36:21.004
-Wait. would ha-- what?
Wha-- say that again.
-Step into the field.

581
00:36:48.293 --> 00:36:50.208
How do you feel?
-

582
00:36:50.251 --> 00:36:51.948
-I didn't feel anything.
-Walk around.

583
00:36:56.257 --> 00:36:58.346
It's good! Everything is good.

584
00:36:59.739 --> 00:37:02.524
Good job everyone! We did it!

585
00:37:04.091 --> 00:37:05.658
Initiating transport.

586
00:37:10.837 --> 00:37:12.055
Oh. Ram.

587
00:37:13.056 --> 00:37:14.493
You didn't think that
we saw you programming

588
00:37:14.536 --> 00:37:16.495
while pretending to be asleep?

589
00:37:17.322 --> 00:37:18.540
You're so predictable.

590
00:37:20.063 --> 00:37:21.369
-I'll take that.
-Well. just at least
let me finish it.

591
00:37:21.413 --> 00:37:23.371
So you can try and sneak
back in time again?

592
00:37:23.415 --> 00:37:24.329
I don't think so.

593
00:37:24.372 --> 00:37:25.939
What about my parents?

594
00:37:25.982 --> 00:37:27.201
Seriously. Ram?

595
00:37:28.811 --> 00:37:29.856
You thought that I would keep
my word for a split second?

596
00:37:29.899 --> 00:37:32.250
-Bastard!
-You're dumber than you look.

597
00:37:32.293 --> 00:37:34.513
-

598
00:37:35.601 --> 00:37:36.950
Take him to confinement.

599
00:37:46.046 --> 00:37:48.701
You're still mad at God
for your wife and family. right?

600
00:37:51.312 --> 00:37:52.226
Yeah.

601
00:37:53.314 --> 00:37:54.620
I have
the perfect mission for you.

602
00:37:55.011 --> 00:37:56.186
You're mad at Jesus.

603
00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:59.189
But wouldn't it be great to know
if he was the real deal

604
00:37:59.233 --> 00:38:01.017
or just a myth?

605
00:38:01.496 --> 00:38:02.628
And how would you prove that?

606
00:38:04.064 --> 00:38:07.459
Prepare a full combat team
and let me enlighten you.

607
00:38:11.985 --> 00:38:14.553
Take a break.
You two. stay here.

608
00:38:15.205 --> 00:38:18.121
Don't be judgmental
or hating on Muslims.

609
00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.559
Ahmed is an extremist.

610
00:38:20.602 --> 00:38:22.038
There's a big difference.

611
00:38:25.694 --> 00:38:26.826
We can't kill him.

612
00:38:27.217 --> 00:38:28.958
Jesus is a prophet.
we should honor him.

613
00:38:29.002 --> 00:38:31.526
Yes. and that's
what we will be doing.

614
00:38:31.918 --> 00:38:34.790
When he died. his disciples
created the resurrection myth.

615
00:38:34.834 --> 00:38:36.966
which gave birth
to Christianity.

616
00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:40.143
-We can correct that.
-But if we kill him.
we'll all be cursed.

617
00:38:40.187 --> 00:38:43.103
Just the opposite.
Allah would honor us.

618
00:38:43.146 --> 00:38:45.758
We would be correcting
the greatest deception
of all time.

619
00:38:46.193 --> 00:38:48.717
He will be remembered
as a great prophet.

620
00:38:48.761 --> 00:38:52.199
but not as the son of God.
Jesus would want that.

621
00:38:52.242 --> 00:38:55.594
And we will be effectively
dismantling Christianity.

622
00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:58.161
If we get caught.
we are going to be so fired.

623
00:38:58.205 --> 00:39:00.076
That's the least
of our concerns.

624
00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:01.643
We have to find him.

625
00:39:01.687 --> 00:39:04.342
Release the other cameras
and keep this room looping.

626
00:39:05.212 --> 00:39:07.562
-Presto.
-Search for Ram.

627
00:39:08.781 --> 00:39:10.435
I don't see him anywhere.

628
00:39:10.478 --> 00:39:11.697
Try our lab.

629
00:39:13.786 --> 00:39:17.093
Guys. what are Ahmed
and those combat guys doing?

630
00:39:17.137 --> 00:39:20.053
They're using Einstein.
but for what?

631
00:39:20.836 --> 00:39:22.664
If Ram created matter transfer.

632
00:39:22.708 --> 00:39:25.841
they can go anywhere
GPS coordinates can take them.

633
00:39:27.234 --> 00:39:29.454
-They did it. they're gone!
-

634
00:39:29.497 --> 00:39:33.371
-Oh. what?
We're gonna get some money!
-It doesn't matter.

635
00:39:33.414 --> 00:39:34.937
Focus on finding Ram.

636
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:39.768
Bingo!
-Where is he?

637
00:39:39.812 --> 00:39:41.379
Uh. that's the south warehouse.

638
00:39:41.422 --> 00:39:42.467
Checking for guards.

639
00:39:43.816 --> 00:39:45.992
-None.
-Can you clear a path
to get us there?

640
00:39:46.471 --> 00:39:48.429
-No problem.
-Okay.

641
00:39:55.175 --> 00:39:57.046
-Are you okay?
-We have a problem.

642
00:39:57.525 --> 00:40:00.180
Ahmed killed my parents
and he was going to torture
and kill you guys.

643
00:40:00.223 --> 00:40:02.835
-so I agreed to build
a time machine.
- A time machine?

644
00:40:02.878 --> 00:40:05.141
-Yeah. Long story.
-They already did it.

645
00:40:05.185 --> 00:40:07.492
They sent Brandt
and a team somewhere already.

646
00:40:09.058 --> 00:40:11.583
If they transfer back in time.
they'll alter history.

647
00:40:12.584 --> 00:40:13.672
We have to go.

648
00:40:36.477 --> 00:40:37.347
All good?

649
00:40:37.783 --> 00:40:38.958
-Check.
-Yes. sir.

650
00:40:39.567 --> 00:40:40.786
-Yeah.
-Find him.

651
00:40:49.185 --> 00:40:50.186
Got them.

652
00:41:07.073 --> 00:41:09.075
Target acquired. Rally on me.

653
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:12.644
You two. on Sabeer.
Flank him. Go.

654
00:41:14.167 --> 00:41:15.647
You two. on me.

655
00:41:20.565 --> 00:41:21.827
Need to verify target.

656
00:41:28.311 --> 00:41:29.617
Target verified.

657
00:41:31.184 --> 00:41:35.493
Three. two. one. Engage.

658
00:41:55.425 --> 00:41:56.601
I've got him.

659
00:41:57.602 --> 00:41:58.690
Kill the rest.

660
00:42:02.824 --> 00:42:04.217
If you really are...

661
00:42:05.218 --> 00:42:06.262
...the son of God...

662
00:42:07.786 --> 00:42:09.439
...you can stop these bullets.

663
00:42:09.918 --> 00:42:12.138
Unless I allow it.

664
00:42:12.181 --> 00:42:13.313
No.

665
00:42:13.835 --> 00:42:15.620
You are not giving me your life.

666
00:42:15.663 --> 00:42:17.273
I am taking it from you!

667
00:42:17.709 --> 00:42:19.362
I have already died for you.

668
00:42:20.755 --> 00:42:23.105
Do what you must.

669
00:42:27.893 --> 00:42:29.764
This is for taking my family.

670
00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:40.688
Bag him.

671
00:42:45.998 --> 00:42:48.261
Leave the arm with the time
retriever hanging out.

672
00:42:52.744 --> 00:42:54.354
Did he just speak English?

673
00:42:56.008 --> 00:42:58.750
In 33 A.D.? Don't be a moron.

674
00:43:02.449 --> 00:43:05.974
You smart off to me
like that again. you will be
picking up your teeth.

675
00:43:11.371 --> 00:43:14.330
We've done
what we came to do. Let's go.

676
00:43:20.685 --> 00:43:21.773
Transfer now.

677
00:43:36.788 --> 00:43:39.965
I wanted you to stop it.

678
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:45.187
Now you know...

679
00:43:46.536 --> 00:43:47.668
...what I feel.

680
00:44:06.513 --> 00:44:10.169
Hey. hey. hey. hey. hey!
Look! They came back.

681
00:44:10.212 --> 00:44:12.998
-They're wearing my retrievers.
-Retrievers?

682
00:44:13.041 --> 00:44:14.826
Without the retrievers.
they can transfer.

683
00:44:14.869 --> 00:44:16.654
but their molecules
would explode.

684
00:44:17.437 --> 00:44:19.004
Is that a body?

685
00:44:19.831 --> 00:44:21.789
Uh. it sure looks like one.

686
00:44:23.486 --> 00:44:26.228
This could be our chance.
I'll go back in time.

687
00:44:26.272 --> 00:44:28.709
expose Ahmed. make sure
time travel never happens.

688
00:44:28.753 --> 00:44:31.494
Felix. can you clear a path
to lab one and loop
all the cameras?

689
00:44:31.538 --> 00:44:33.671
I can't believe
you guys keep asking

690
00:44:33.714 --> 00:44:35.324
such obvious questions.

691
00:44:41.548 --> 00:44:43.158
Felix. disable the door.

692
00:44:43.202 --> 00:44:45.726
Ahmed changed time
depending on the circumstances.

693
00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:47.815
-we might not exist
in a few minutes.
- Say what?

694
00:44:47.859 --> 00:44:50.775
Look. if whatever he did
affected us. wouldn't we
have changed already?

695
00:44:50.818 --> 00:44:52.515
Time doesn't change
instantaneously.

696
00:44:52.559 --> 00:44:54.604
-it has to rewrite itself.
-Rewrite itself?

697
00:44:54.648 --> 00:44:56.955
It's like the speed of light.
It appears to move instantly.

698
00:44:56.998 --> 00:45:00.175
-but light has a speed.
-So that's why everything
was blowing up on the time pad.

699
00:45:00.219 --> 00:45:03.048
Exactly. We were inadvertently
splitting the time continuum.

700
00:45:03.091 --> 00:45:05.006
So time must
have catched up with itself.

701
00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:07.226
Exactly. like overwriting data
in a hard drive.

702
00:45:07.269 --> 00:45:09.010
The old time continuum
is written over

703
00:45:09.054 --> 00:45:11.491
as the new data is received.
That could take minutes.

704
00:45:11.534 --> 00:45:12.840
hours. possibly longer.

705
00:45:12.884 --> 00:45:14.450
depending on how far back
in time they went.

706
00:45:14.494 --> 00:45:16.148
Got it. Doors are secured.

707
00:45:16.583 --> 00:45:19.151
So you're telling me
it's possible that
it already happened

708
00:45:19.194 --> 00:45:20.456
and we're already
in a new time continuum?

709
00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.458
Sure. if they changed
something minor.

710
00:45:22.502 --> 00:45:24.373
But if Ahmed killed
someone important.

711
00:45:24.809 --> 00:45:26.114
we might cease to exist.

712
00:45:28.073 --> 00:45:30.075
- Access denied.

713
00:45:30.118 --> 00:45:31.859
-Can you get us out of here?

714
00:45:31.903 --> 00:45:33.643
Einstein. initiate retrievers.

715
00:45:33.687 --> 00:45:36.124
Initialized timecode. 1:50 am.

716
00:45:36.168 --> 00:45:37.386
Quick. come put these on.

717
00:45:40.738 --> 00:45:42.130
Override door locks at lab one.

718
00:45:42.174 --> 00:45:44.567
-Coordinates denied.

719
00:45:44.611 --> 00:45:46.787
-What?
-Access denied.

720
00:45:46.831 --> 00:45:48.746
They went
really far back in time.

721
00:45:48.789 --> 00:45:50.399
-We're gonna have
to go back further.
-

722
00:45:50.443 --> 00:45:52.227
Hurry. Ram.
they're overriding me!

723
00:45:52.271 --> 00:45:54.186
Einstein. program
last known coordinates.

724
00:45:54.229 --> 00:45:55.970
Initiating transfer.

725
00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:14.293
-Sorry.
-Thanks.

726
00:46:18.123 --> 00:46:19.559
I don't know about you guys...

727
00:46:20.038 --> 00:46:21.953
-I'm going this way.
- Yeah.

728
00:46:25.391 --> 00:46:27.567
Hold on. Hold-- hold on.

729
00:46:28.002 --> 00:46:30.352
Yo. what are we running for?

730
00:46:31.136 --> 00:46:32.615
What was that light?

731
00:46:32.659 --> 00:46:33.965
Must have been Ahmed's guys.

732
00:46:34.008 --> 00:46:35.705
This is the same time
they materialized.

733
00:46:36.794 --> 00:46:39.840
Are we safe from the time
continuum overwriting?

734
00:46:40.319 --> 00:46:41.233
Uh...

735
00:46:42.364 --> 00:46:44.410
...we transferred
from continuum A

736
00:46:44.453 --> 00:46:47.065
and materialized in continuum B.
which is a part of continuum A.

737
00:46:47.108 --> 00:46:50.677
but by being here.
in theory we're creating
a new continuum. C.

738
00:46:51.069 --> 00:46:52.635
Time can't loop itself.
we should be fine.

739
00:46:52.679 --> 00:46:55.769
Wait. hol-- slow that down
and say that again.

740
00:46:56.291 --> 00:46:58.250
If B overwrites A.
then there won't be

741
00:46:58.293 --> 00:47:00.121
a time continuum
for us to return to.

742
00:47:00.165 --> 00:47:01.862
Nothing to go back to?

743
00:47:01.906 --> 00:47:04.082
We're just stuck here?

744
00:47:04.734 --> 00:47:05.823
I don't know yet.

745
00:47:15.528 --> 00:47:16.529
It's Jesus.

746
00:47:34.112 --> 00:47:35.461
Stop running!

747
00:47:37.376 --> 00:47:39.552
I get it. Eliminate Christianity

748
00:47:39.595 --> 00:47:41.684
by killing Jesus
before the resurrection.

749
00:47:41.728 --> 00:47:44.470
Ahmed just killed off every
Christian that ever existed.

750
00:47:44.513 --> 00:47:46.602
Why would Muslims do that?
It makes no sense!

751
00:47:46.646 --> 00:47:49.127
They wouldn't. But Ahmed
is part of an extremist group.

752
00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:50.519
This can't be happening.

753
00:47:50.563 --> 00:47:53.000
Jesus is God.
he can't be killed by men.

754
00:47:53.044 --> 00:47:54.262
That's not factually correct.

755
00:47:54.306 --> 00:47:56.047
he was actually killed by men.

756
00:47:56.090 --> 00:47:58.179
He wouldn't allow it
to happen this way.

757
00:47:58.701 --> 00:48:01.661
Okay. let's look at this
from your perspective.

758
00:48:01.704 --> 00:48:04.882
If Jesus is God. then he would
only allow this to happen

759
00:48:04.925 --> 00:48:06.187
if he had
another purpose. right?

760
00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:09.190
If he can control time.
then he can inherently create

761
00:48:09.234 --> 00:48:11.018
-several time continuums.
each one different.
-Guys.

762
00:48:11.062 --> 00:48:12.890
can we talk theology later?

763
00:48:12.933 --> 00:48:15.327
-We need to get home
before time changes.
-Okay.

764
00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:17.720
If continuum B
has overwritten continuum A.

765
00:48:17.764 --> 00:48:19.418
there's nothing for us
to go back to.

766
00:48:19.461 --> 00:48:21.899
Our genes will be splattered
across the universe.

767
00:48:22.247 --> 00:48:24.162
However. it's safe to assume

768
00:48:24.205 --> 00:48:27.730
that 2.000 years is
an enormous amount of data
to overwrite itself.

769
00:48:28.122 --> 00:48:31.343
That could take anywhere
from a year to...

770
00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:34.259
-...maybe ten minutes?
-Ten minutes?

771
00:48:34.302 --> 00:48:35.869
What are we waiting for.
man? Let's go.

772
00:48:35.913 --> 00:48:38.263
Our chances of success improve
if we split into groups.

773
00:48:38.306 --> 00:48:41.092
Amy and I will go first.
then you two follow.

774
00:48:41.135 --> 00:48:42.658
They might be waiting for us.

775
00:48:42.702 --> 00:48:45.923
If we're killed.
it'll be up to you two.

776
00:48:46.532 --> 00:48:48.403
Let's say you guys
do get killed. right?

777
00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:50.405
How do we fix this?

778
00:48:50.449 --> 00:48:51.929
There's a default code
I programmed

779
00:48:51.972 --> 00:48:53.060
while pretending to be asleep.

780
00:48:53.626 --> 00:48:56.846
Say to Einstein.
"Mom and Dad default."

781
00:48:56.890 --> 00:48:58.283
It takes you back
to the warehouse

782
00:48:58.326 --> 00:49:00.546
about ten minutes before
they killed my parents.

783
00:49:01.025 --> 00:49:03.766
You'll have to stop them.
and free me.

784
00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:06.639
Oh. man. this--

785
00:49:08.119 --> 00:49:10.164
All right. man.

786
00:49:12.253 --> 00:49:13.602
Let's do this.

787
00:49:14.821 --> 00:49:16.475
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay.

788
00:49:16.823 --> 00:49:18.172
Hold down both simultaneously.

789
00:49:18.216 --> 00:49:21.306
-Ready.
-Three. two. one.

790
00:49:47.158 --> 00:49:48.028
Hurry!

791
00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:49.812
Mine's not working. try yours.

792
00:49:50.248 --> 00:49:51.640
-

793
00:49:52.772 --> 00:49:54.992
-What are we gonna do?
-I don't know yet.

794
00:49:55.035 --> 00:49:57.864
Let's hope we're a good enough
distraction for Simon and Felix.

795
00:49:57.907 --> 00:49:59.387
This might still be operational.

796
00:50:00.171 --> 00:50:01.650
If I can reprogram
this first machine.

797
00:50:01.694 --> 00:50:03.870
I might be able
to transfer us out of here.

798
00:50:06.046 --> 00:50:08.048
-What happened here?
-We're prepping the machine.

799
00:50:08.092 --> 00:50:10.224
and Ram and Amy just appeared
on the transfer pad.

800
00:50:10.268 --> 00:50:12.183
-What?
-That's impossible.

801
00:50:12.226 --> 00:50:14.054
I locked him in the cell myself.

802
00:50:14.098 --> 00:50:16.187
Take the team. track them down.

803
00:50:17.188 --> 00:50:19.494
Lock it down.
Nobody comes or goes.

804
00:50:19.538 --> 00:50:23.020
Lockdown. lockdown. Apprehend
Ram Goldstein and Amy Lee.

805
00:50:24.804 --> 00:50:25.848
Say again.

806
00:50:27.850 --> 00:50:31.115
They found them. They've
barricaded themselves in lab 19.

807
00:50:31.724 --> 00:50:32.681
Get out of my way!

808
00:50:38.861 --> 00:50:39.732
Get the saw!

809
00:50:41.081 --> 00:50:42.517
This is inaccurate.

810
00:50:42.561 --> 00:50:45.303
We must be in an alternate
time continuum. but how?

811
00:50:45.346 --> 00:50:47.348
What time did Einstein
program our retrievers?

812
00:50:47.392 --> 00:50:50.308
-It was 1:50 am.
-No. it's only 1:20 am. now.

813
00:50:50.351 --> 00:50:51.570
We came back before we left?

814
00:50:51.613 --> 00:50:53.311
If we were gone for 30 minutes.

815
00:50:53.354 --> 00:50:54.877
we should have roughly returned
around 2:20 am.

816
00:50:54.921 --> 00:50:57.837
Wait. daylight savings time.
It started tonight.

817
00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:00.535
Einstein's clock resets at 2:20.
it must have overcompensated

818
00:51:00.579 --> 00:51:02.059
and sent us back an hour early.

819
00:51:08.543 --> 00:51:09.979
Give me your time retriever.

820
00:51:10.023 --> 00:51:11.372
These won't work anymore.

821
00:51:11.416 --> 00:51:13.070
-I need to sync them with...
-

822
00:51:14.723 --> 00:51:15.681
...this phone.

823
00:51:17.683 --> 00:51:20.468
1:20 I was... oh!

824
00:51:22.731 --> 00:51:24.820
-What are you doing?
-You're not
the only genius here.

825
00:51:24.864 --> 00:51:28.389
As soon as she figured out
the daylight savings time issue.

826
00:51:28.433 --> 00:51:31.610
she knew that the other Amy.
Felix and Simon

827
00:51:31.653 --> 00:51:34.047
were in the server room
searching for me.

828
00:51:34.091 --> 00:51:37.311
-That was in the original
time continuum.
-"Ahmed used...

829
00:51:38.225 --> 00:51:39.835
...Ram's time machine

830
00:51:39.879 --> 00:51:43.317
to go back in time
and kill Jesus!

831
00:51:43.361 --> 00:51:47.147
You must free Ram from the south
warehouse and stop them.

832
00:51:47.539 --> 00:51:50.759
Ahmed does not know
that you exist. Hurry!"

833
00:51:52.457 --> 00:51:55.155
-Okay. I'm almost done.

834
00:51:55.199 --> 00:51:56.374
Get on the time pad.

835
00:52:01.814 --> 00:52:02.728
I'm dead.

836
00:52:03.642 --> 00:52:06.297
No. you just warned yourself.

837
00:52:06.819 --> 00:52:08.690
We got to free Ram
and change this.

838
00:52:08.734 --> 00:52:09.778
Targets are down.

839
00:52:12.825 --> 00:52:13.739
Let's go.

840
00:52:18.135 --> 00:52:19.701
I got him. Let's go get him.

841
00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:21.138
All right.

842
00:52:23.227 --> 00:52:26.317
-Get out. Get up. Get out now.
- Come on. Let's go!

843
00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:28.057
-Let's go!
-Go!

844
00:52:28.101 --> 00:52:30.799
Get you-- get your-- get out!

845
00:52:30.843 --> 00:52:32.671
You. get out!

846
00:52:33.062 --> 00:52:36.109
-

847
00:52:36.153 --> 00:52:38.285
-This might take a few minutes.
-We don't have a few minutes.

848
00:52:38.329 --> 00:52:40.940
-Hurry. Ram. I don't know
if I can hold them out!

849
00:52:40.983 --> 00:52:43.812
Setting destination.
Ten minutes prior
to the last transfer.

850
00:52:43.856 --> 00:52:45.510
Initiating transfer.

851
00:52:45.553 --> 00:52:48.208
-Initiate time retriever.
-Confirmed. 1:40 am.

852
00:52:48.252 --> 00:52:49.209
Quick. come put these on!

853
00:52:49.253 --> 00:52:50.341
What are these?

854
00:52:50.384 --> 00:52:51.733
Uh. time retrievers.

855
00:52:51.777 --> 00:52:53.213
Just put one on
if you want to live.

856
00:52:53.257 --> 00:52:54.606
And get into the time field.

857
00:53:00.264 --> 00:53:02.004
Hey. we gotta go.

858
00:53:02.353 --> 00:53:04.616
Ram and Amy have been waiting
for you for like 30 minutes now.

859
00:53:04.659 --> 00:53:06.487
No. you go. I'll stay here.

860
00:53:06.531 --> 00:53:08.707
We talked about this.

861
00:53:09.098 --> 00:53:10.187
That's not an option.

862
00:53:11.492 --> 00:53:13.712
Everything's gonna be
all right. I got you.

863
00:53:15.366 --> 00:53:18.238
Besides. Happy needs you.

864
00:53:18.282 --> 00:53:19.239
Yeah. Happy needs me.

865
00:53:19.283 --> 00:53:21.110
-Yeah.
-

866
00:53:21.546 --> 00:53:23.635
What these are gonna do
against their guns?

867
00:53:25.114 --> 00:53:26.551
Look. I said I got you. okay?

868
00:53:26.986 --> 00:53:28.901
Now. come on.
let's go. On three.

869
00:53:29.336 --> 00:53:33.601
One... two... three.

870
00:53:42.219 --> 00:53:45.570
Oh. no! No. no. no. no. no!

871
00:54:00.019 --> 00:54:00.933
How did you get here?

872
00:54:02.151 --> 00:54:04.241
Scotty beamed me down
from the Enterprise.

873
00:54:04.719 --> 00:54:06.634
-

874
00:54:07.766 --> 00:54:10.377
You two. keep working.
Find out what happened.

875
00:54:10.812 --> 00:54:13.772
The rest of you.
bring Felix with me.

876
00:54:21.475 --> 00:54:22.911
How did you get into my lab?

877
00:54:23.651 --> 00:54:25.827
Don't you really know?
Time travel.

878
00:54:34.271 --> 00:54:35.794
Oh. man. it started.

879
00:54:35.837 --> 00:54:37.796
What is this? What started?

880
00:54:38.536 --> 00:54:41.582
Your men went back in time and
killed Jesus and his disciples.

881
00:54:41.626 --> 00:54:44.716
-Liar. we did not do this.
-Yes. you did.

882
00:54:45.543 --> 00:54:47.936
Now the timeline
is overriding itself.

883
00:54:57.076 --> 00:54:58.295
This is your world.

884
00:54:59.165 --> 00:55:00.819
This can't be right.

885
00:55:01.385 --> 00:55:03.300
The world that you created.

886
00:55:04.126 --> 00:55:05.519
A world without forgiveness.

887
00:55:43.165 --> 00:55:46.865
Remember us using the time
machine and fleeing lab one?

888
00:55:46.908 --> 00:55:48.432
-It worked!
-Well.

889
00:55:48.475 --> 00:55:51.086
this is us landing in 33 A.D.

890
00:55:51.130 --> 00:55:54.046
I programmed us to arrive
ten minutes before Ahmed
and his guys.

891
00:55:54.394 --> 00:55:55.787
We'll have
the element of surprise.

892
00:55:56.135 --> 00:55:58.442
And how is that supposed
to help us against their guns?

893
00:55:58.877 --> 00:56:01.358
I have an idea.
but they'll only be vulnerable

894
00:56:01.401 --> 00:56:02.663
while they're materializing.

895
00:56:04.361 --> 00:56:05.579
Everybody geared up.
strapped up. locked and loaded.

896
00:56:05.623 --> 00:56:07.276
We don't know
what we'll be stepping into.

897
00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:09.017
Oh. yeah!

898
00:56:09.453 --> 00:56:11.106
It's time to get dirty.

899
00:56:30.038 --> 00:56:31.039
No. no. no!

900
00:56:32.476 --> 00:56:33.868
Did any of them get away?

901
00:56:33.912 --> 00:56:36.262
Uh... Brandt and Sabeer
went off the cliff.

902
00:56:36.305 --> 00:56:39.221
-The rest are dead.
-Go after them. Ram.

903
00:56:39.265 --> 00:56:41.267
Don't let them kill Jesus.

904
00:56:41.310 --> 00:56:42.268
I can't leave you.

905
00:56:46.228 --> 00:56:47.926
I added a safety protocol.

906
00:56:47.969 --> 00:56:50.232
If the retriever detects
no pulse--

907
00:56:50.276 --> 00:56:53.453
Ram. you have to make sure.

908
00:56:53.932 --> 00:56:55.368
Save Jesus!

909
00:56:55.412 --> 00:56:58.066
If Jesus is God. I think
he can take care of himself.

910
00:56:58.110 --> 00:56:59.416
Make sure!

911
00:57:02.593 --> 00:57:03.724
Okay.

912
00:57:08.555 --> 00:57:09.556
I see one of them.

913
00:57:16.476 --> 00:57:21.089
-I don't want to leave you.
-Please... do this for me.

914
00:57:23.396 --> 00:57:24.702
-Okay.
-

915
00:57:24.745 --> 00:57:27.748
Okay. Let's stop the bleeding.

916
00:57:44.635 --> 00:57:45.984
This is gonna hurt.

917
00:57:52.164 --> 00:57:55.994
Okay. just don't--
just don't die. okay?

918
00:57:58.170 --> 00:57:59.650
I'll come back.

919
00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:16.623
Brandt. is that you?

920
00:58:46.392 --> 00:58:47.524
It would be me.

921
00:58:47.567 --> 00:58:48.655
Remember Simon

922
00:58:48.699 --> 00:58:50.352
that got stuck in the past?

923
00:58:50.396 --> 00:58:51.832
He's been there a full day

924
00:58:51.876 --> 00:58:53.617
and getting a little testy.

925
00:58:54.879 --> 00:58:57.751
Ram. listen. if you can hear me.

926
00:58:57.795 --> 00:59:00.580
I'm still stuck down here
and I would really like
to go home.

927
00:59:00.624 --> 00:59:02.147
so can you please beam me up?

928
00:59:07.718 --> 00:59:09.067
Country. please.

929
00:59:30.088 --> 00:59:33.482
Uh. hey. uh. are you okay?

930
00:59:35.659 --> 00:59:39.271
Uh... No speako Grieco?

931
00:59:43.884 --> 00:59:45.712
Has my father sent you?

932
00:59:45.756 --> 00:59:47.714
What? You speak English?

933
00:59:50.456 --> 00:59:51.631
Are you Jesus?

934
00:59:54.025 --> 00:59:54.939
It is I.

935
00:59:59.465 --> 01:00:01.859
What is your purpose here?

936
01:00:02.773 --> 01:00:04.122
Purpose? Uh...

937
01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:07.952
...I think I'm here to save you.

938
01:00:08.735 --> 01:00:11.520
Listen. if you go back
to your camp.

939
01:00:11.564 --> 01:00:13.305
men will come and shoot you.

940
01:00:13.914 --> 01:00:16.134
You know it. shooting. shoot.

941
01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:17.831
I'm sorry. Jesus.

942
01:00:17.875 --> 01:00:20.442
What you describe cannot be so.

943
01:00:20.965 --> 01:00:22.749
It's a lot better
than the other way.

944
01:00:23.794 --> 01:00:26.710
Listen. a mob comes.

945
01:00:26.753 --> 01:00:28.102
and they take you.

946
01:00:28.146 --> 01:00:29.364
and then they beat you.

947
01:00:29.408 --> 01:00:30.801
and then they whip you.

948
01:00:31.149 --> 01:00:32.977
and then they nail spikes
through your hands and feet.

949
01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:34.631
and they hang you on a cross.

950
01:00:35.501 --> 01:00:36.502
It ain't pretty.

951
01:00:37.155 --> 01:00:39.418
How do you know
all these things?

952
01:00:40.724 --> 01:00:43.422
Well. uh... I'm from the future.

953
01:00:44.815 --> 01:00:46.120
And I've seen your movie.

954
01:00:46.425 --> 01:00:47.818
We got it on bootleg.

955
01:00:49.602 --> 01:00:50.690
Forgive me. Lord. I'm sorry.

956
01:00:51.386 --> 01:00:54.476
But. uh.
they mess you up pretty bad.

957
01:00:57.436 --> 01:00:59.003
And what of my disciples?

958
01:01:00.787 --> 01:01:04.095
Well. if they don't get
slaughtered by the assassins.
then...

959
01:01:04.965 --> 01:01:08.403
...I think Peter
gets crucified upside down.

960
01:01:13.757 --> 01:01:17.064
Father.
please don't let this be.

961
01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:22.983
If it is already so
you can still change things.

962
01:01:23.027 --> 01:01:24.768
For the sake of one.

963
01:01:26.247 --> 01:01:28.641
You are the creator of all time.

964
01:01:29.033 --> 01:01:32.123
You can change
whatever you desire.

965
01:01:33.559 --> 01:01:35.430
Please grant me this.

966
01:01:36.605 --> 01:01:38.738
Allow Peter to live.

967
01:01:39.391 --> 01:01:42.873
Listen. don't get bummed out.
all right? I--

968
01:01:43.395 --> 01:01:45.310
I might be wrong
about the whole Peter thing.

969
01:01:45.789 --> 01:01:48.748
I kind of turned off your movie
when your flesh
starts flying around

970
01:01:48.792 --> 01:01:50.402
and sticking and stuff.

971
01:01:51.533 --> 01:01:53.927
What else do you know
of me in your future?

972
01:01:54.406 --> 01:01:56.147
The book that you wrote.
the Bible?

973
01:01:56.582 --> 01:01:58.715
It's the most read book
in history.

974
01:01:58.758 --> 01:02:01.805
I mean. you--
you have millions of believers.

975
01:02:04.895 --> 01:02:06.418
Praise you. Father.

976
01:02:08.376 --> 01:02:10.814
Thank you for sharing
this with me.

977
01:02:14.818 --> 01:02:16.515
Your words are encouraging.

978
01:02:17.342 --> 01:02:20.519
-You have given me strength.
-Gosh.

979
01:02:20.562 --> 01:02:24.523
I must now lay down my life
for the sins of this world.

980
01:02:24.566 --> 01:02:27.831
What?
That's not even close
to what I said. man.

981
01:02:28.919 --> 01:02:30.485
I'm trying to help you escape.

982
01:02:30.921 --> 01:02:34.402
If there was another way.
I would welcome it.

983
01:02:35.012 --> 01:02:36.317
But there is not.

984
01:02:41.279 --> 01:02:43.281
What you doing.
some mind reading? Okay.

985
01:02:45.022 --> 01:02:50.157
Simon. If I do not give my life.
you will die

986
01:02:50.201 --> 01:02:52.116
and never be with me in heaven.

987
01:02:57.295 --> 01:03:00.341
Well. if that's the case.
go ahead and do your thing.
It's your life.

988
01:03:00.385 --> 01:03:02.039
No. no. no. no.
Jesus. Jesus. Jesus.

989
01:03:02.082 --> 01:03:03.344
Hey. it's a joke. Jesus.

990
01:03:03.388 --> 01:03:04.955
Don't do it.
I'm just joking with you.

991
01:03:05.477 --> 01:03:07.784
Thank you for helping me
tomorrow.

992
01:03:11.091 --> 01:03:14.921
Seriously. man.
don't do this to yourself.

993
01:03:16.183 --> 01:03:18.795
Look. giving away your life
is one thing. but...

994
01:03:19.404 --> 01:03:21.710
...knowing that they
about to put the hurt on you?

995
01:03:21.754 --> 01:03:24.148
There's gotta be
another way to save the world.

996
01:03:24.191 --> 01:03:26.628
Ju-- just gotta be. man.

997
01:03:26.672 --> 01:03:28.935
I know what is going
to happen to me...

998
01:03:30.023 --> 01:03:32.417
...and if you had finished
my movie.

999
01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:33.722
you would know

1000
01:03:33.766 --> 01:03:35.159
that I'll be back.

1001
01:03:40.512 --> 01:03:41.513
"I'll be back?"

1002
01:03:42.862 --> 01:03:44.168
That ain't even your movie.

1003
01:03:49.303 --> 01:03:51.697
Sabeer. I'm gonna find you.
you coward.

1004
01:04:10.281 --> 01:04:11.935
Why are you making this so hard?

1005
01:04:46.795 --> 01:04:47.840
Peter?

1006
01:04:47.884 --> 01:04:49.015
With Jesus?

1007
01:04:50.495 --> 01:04:51.888
-Peter with Yeshua.

1008
01:04:54.803 --> 01:04:56.893
I saw you with that sword.

1009
01:04:56.936 --> 01:04:58.459
You cut off the guy's ear.

1010
01:05:13.953 --> 01:05:15.302
It's gonna be okay.

1011
01:05:55.342 --> 01:05:57.214
Stop. don't go that way.

1012
01:05:57.736 --> 01:05:58.998
They'll kill you.

1013
01:06:00.173 --> 01:06:02.132
Stop. they'll kill you.

1014
01:06:06.266 --> 01:06:07.702
What happened here?

1015
01:06:08.138 --> 01:06:09.530
We don't know what happened...

1016
01:06:11.141 --> 01:06:12.272
...but they're all dead.

1017
01:06:16.059 --> 01:06:17.974
Gunshot wounds to the kids.

1018
01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:20.193
Sticks in our guys.

1019
01:06:20.237 --> 01:06:21.890
This is strange.

1020
01:06:22.848 --> 01:06:24.806
Brandt and Sabeer
must have sent the bodies back.

1021
01:06:24.850 --> 01:06:26.808
Is it possible to retrieve
any of them here?

1022
01:06:27.548 --> 01:06:31.639
No. but I think I can disable
Amy and Ram's time retrievers.

1023
01:06:31.683 --> 01:06:33.119
That will keep them
from returning.

1024
01:06:33.163 --> 01:06:35.426
Do it and clean up this mess.

1025
01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:11.549
Team report.

1026
01:07:12.289 --> 01:07:13.638
It's Sabeer.

1027
01:07:14.291 --> 01:07:16.206
I thought you were a goner.

1028
01:07:17.163 --> 01:07:18.686
I'm glad you're wrong.

1029
01:07:21.124 --> 01:07:22.603
And the team?

1030
01:07:22.647 --> 01:07:23.343
All dead.

1031
01:07:24.866 --> 01:07:26.390
I don't know
how many of the geniuses died.

1032
01:07:26.825 --> 01:07:30.176
After we fell off the cliff.
Ram came after me.

1033
01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:32.091
You mean after you
pulled me off the cliff?

1034
01:07:35.747 --> 01:07:40.882
-And Ram?
-He... sort of got my weapon.

1035
01:07:40.926 --> 01:07:42.623
Why does that not surprise me?

1036
01:07:46.105 --> 01:07:47.498
Did you find Jesus?

1037
01:07:47.541 --> 01:07:49.587
A-- a bunch of soldiers
came and took him.

1038
01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:51.589
That's what's supposed
to happen. right?

1039
01:07:52.459 --> 01:07:54.809
I'm gonna check
on your injuries. okay?

1040
01:07:59.205 --> 01:08:01.425
We have to return
and get you to a hospital.

1041
01:08:01.468 --> 01:08:03.514
They'll kill us as soon
as we materialize.

1042
01:08:03.557 --> 01:08:08.388
Perhaps. But if we stay here.
you won't have a chance.

1043
01:08:08.432 --> 01:08:10.390
I'm not gonna let
you risk your life--

1044
01:08:10.434 --> 01:08:13.480
I'd rather die trying
to save you than live
knowing that I didn't.

1045
01:08:14.264 --> 01:08:15.787
We have to try.

1046
01:08:15.830 --> 01:08:18.094
No. Ram. No.

1047
01:08:18.137 --> 01:08:20.618
Three. two. one.

1048
01:08:21.836 --> 01:08:22.794
What?

1049
01:08:24.187 --> 01:08:25.231
No. no. no. no.

1050
01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:27.625
Oh. they must have
deactivated them.

1051
01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:29.844
What does that mean?

1052
01:08:31.455 --> 01:08:34.806
We're stranded here
with no way to get back.

1053
01:08:35.328 --> 01:08:37.330
Ram. I'm cold.

1054
01:08:37.374 --> 01:08:38.940
Please hold me.

1055
01:09:03.313 --> 01:09:05.663
-Let's just go.
-No.

1056
01:09:06.490 --> 01:09:08.492
Finish what we came here to do.

1057
01:09:12.235 --> 01:09:15.281
-Why aren't you taking your gun?
-No guns.

1058
01:09:15.325 --> 01:09:16.500
It's recon only.

1059
01:09:20.243 --> 01:09:21.461
Cover that up.

1060
01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:29.339
Hurry up already.

1061
01:09:55.016 --> 01:09:56.322
It's just a tomato.

1062
01:10:04.983 --> 01:10:07.159
-Back off.
-

1063
01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:09.596
I said back off.

1064
01:11:19.362 --> 01:11:21.494
-

1065
01:11:34.681 --> 01:11:39.295
Why? Why you going
to go through with this?

1066
01:11:39.904 --> 01:11:41.253
Stay down. okay?

1067
01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:46.345
I can't.
I have to finish this.

1068
01:11:46.389 --> 01:11:49.305
I must... finish.

1069
01:11:50.697 --> 01:11:53.831
-Hey. stop hitting him.

1070
01:11:57.051 --> 01:11:59.750
Help me. please.
-Come on. man.

1071
01:12:00.359 --> 01:12:01.534
Come on. man.

1072
01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:09.934
I got you. all right?

1073
01:12:13.285 --> 01:12:14.460
I got you.

1074
01:12:46.666 --> 01:12:47.754
Help.

1075
01:12:50.409 --> 01:12:52.193
Doctor? Healer?

1076
01:12:52.237 --> 01:12:55.588
-Physician?

1077
01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:30.797
No. I said I need a doctor!

1078
01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:34.540
Baby. Baby.

1079
01:13:38.588 --> 01:13:44.420
Well. if you're who you say
you are. then please heal her.

1080
01:13:47.771 --> 01:13:49.773
She risked her life for you.

1081
01:13:51.992 --> 01:13:54.473
Do you even understand
what I'm saying?

1082
01:13:55.996 --> 01:13:58.129
You're wasting your time.

1083
01:13:59.435 --> 01:14:00.523
Sabeer.

1084
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:06.964
He can't even save himself.

1085
01:14:17.278 --> 01:14:18.758
We deserve this fate.

1086
01:14:24.329 --> 01:14:25.809
He's done nothing wrong.

1087
01:14:28.812 --> 01:14:33.033
He's dying just like us.

1088
01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:35.906
He is nothing but a criminal.

1089
01:14:35.949 --> 01:14:38.865
- Jesus...

1090
01:14:45.263 --> 01:14:46.612
...please. forgive me.

1091
01:14:53.271 --> 01:14:54.664
Remember me...

1092
01:14:58.668 --> 01:15:00.060
...when you enter your kingdom.

1093
01:15:10.897 --> 01:15:12.682
You will be with me...

1094
01:15:13.334 --> 01:15:14.684
...in paradise.

1095
01:15:17.556 --> 01:15:19.993
He tried to kill you!

1096
01:15:20.037 --> 01:15:21.299
And me!

1097
01:15:21.342 --> 01:15:23.040
He shot Amy!

1098
01:15:24.215 --> 01:15:26.957
If you're God.
wouldn't you know that?

1099
01:15:27.392 --> 01:15:29.437
And now you're forgiving him?

1100
01:15:29.481 --> 01:15:32.049
Your forgiveness means nothing!

1101
01:15:32.832 --> 01:15:34.530
Prove that you're God!

1102
01:15:34.921 --> 01:15:37.968
Come down off that cross
and heal Amy!

1103
01:15:39.186 --> 01:15:42.189
You're supposed
to be a genius...

1104
01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:45.149
...and you're asking him
for help.

1105
01:15:45.192 --> 01:15:46.542
Shut up. Sabeer.

1106
01:15:48.369 --> 01:15:49.762
Please!

1107
01:15:50.284 --> 01:15:52.330
Please. save her.

1108
01:15:54.245 --> 01:15:55.681
Please.

1109
01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:02.688
You're nothing but a fraud.

1110
01:16:03.907 --> 01:16:06.344
And now she's gonna die
because of you.

1111
01:16:22.447 --> 01:16:24.101
To save Amy.

1112
01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:27.974
you must forgive Brandt.

1113
01:16:29.497 --> 01:16:30.934
I'll never forgive him.

1114
01:16:32.457 --> 01:16:33.589
Or you.

1115
01:17:06.578 --> 01:17:09.494
Ram! Ram!
-Simon?

1116
01:17:09.537 --> 01:17:11.104
Man. where have you been?

1117
01:17:12.671 --> 01:17:13.629
What happened to Amy?

1118
01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:14.934
They killed you. How--

1119
01:17:14.978 --> 01:17:16.806
What? Back it up.

1120
01:17:17.197 --> 01:17:18.851
I'm still alive. man.
Nobody killed me.

1121
01:17:19.243 --> 01:17:22.333
-I've been stuck here.
-Stuck here? You came with me.

1122
01:17:23.508 --> 01:17:26.206
Wait. were you
with the first me? The other me?

1123
01:17:26.816 --> 01:17:28.774
First me?
What are you talking about?

1124
01:17:28.818 --> 01:17:30.689
The original me returned
from the past

1125
01:17:30.733 --> 01:17:33.257
and then I sent us back here
to save Jesus. And we did.

1126
01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:35.651
But now we're stuck here.
Why are you here?

1127
01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:38.131
You gave me
the cereal box version

1128
01:17:38.175 --> 01:17:40.656
and it blew up on me
like three times. man.

1129
01:17:42.832 --> 01:17:44.007
Solar eclipse.

1130
01:17:44.355 --> 01:17:46.139
Man. you know.
all this historical stuff

1131
01:17:46.183 --> 01:17:47.793
is incredibly accurate.

1132
01:17:47.837 --> 01:17:50.448
-It doesn't prove that he's God.
-Yo. hold up.

1133
01:17:50.927 --> 01:17:52.363
I was with him. all right?

1134
01:17:53.190 --> 01:17:55.714
Just because
Jesus may not be God.

1135
01:17:55.758 --> 01:17:57.237
doesn't mean
he doesn't think he is.

1136
01:17:59.152 --> 01:18:02.286
God or man. he's worthless
if he doesn't care about
the ones who love him.

1137
01:18:02.329 --> 01:18:05.028
I'm telling you.
there's something special
about this dude.

1138
01:18:05.855 --> 01:18:10.381
He even knows English.
English! It hasn't
even been created yet.

1139
01:18:10.424 --> 01:18:11.556
It doesn't matter!

1140
01:18:12.078 --> 01:18:14.211
Ahmed deactivated
our retrievers.

1141
01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:17.649
We need to find the ones
that Brandt and Sabeer
were using.

1142
01:18:18.041 --> 01:18:19.433
Or we'll never get home.

1143
01:18:24.787 --> 01:18:26.832
-How did this get here?
-I don't know.

1144
01:18:26.876 --> 01:18:29.008
They just materialized
on the transfer pad.

1145
01:18:29.052 --> 01:18:30.923
It is Brandt or Sabeer's.

1146
01:18:33.491 --> 01:18:36.015
Reprogram the machine
and send another team back.

1147
01:18:36.059 --> 01:18:37.364
Find Ram and kill him.

1148
01:18:37.408 --> 01:18:40.498
I can't.
All the retrievers are fried.

1149
01:18:40.541 --> 01:18:41.891
This is our only one.

1150
01:18:44.589 --> 01:18:48.027
Then I will go.
His body will be in the tomb.

1151
01:18:48.071 --> 01:18:49.986
When they come to steal it.
I'll kill them all.

1152
01:18:50.029 --> 01:18:51.161
You should let me go.

1153
01:18:51.204 --> 01:18:53.772
No. this is an honor I want.

1154
01:18:54.338 --> 01:18:58.342
Jesus might have been a prophet.
but he isn't God.
I can prove it.

1155
01:19:28.676 --> 01:19:30.330
Dead as dead can be.

1156
01:19:32.202 --> 01:19:34.334
Now I'll wait for your friends
to show up.

1157
01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:39.862
There'll be nobody
to remember you.

1158
01:19:47.608 --> 01:19:48.479
Simon.

1159
01:19:49.828 --> 01:19:50.916
Simon?

1160
01:19:52.309 --> 01:19:53.179
What?

1161
01:19:54.485 --> 01:19:56.661
How could he forgive Brandt
and not save Amy?

1162
01:19:56.704 --> 01:19:59.185
And then tell me that I have
to forgive Brandt too.

1163
01:20:00.273 --> 01:20:02.580
-Who are you talking about?
-Jesus!

1164
01:20:02.623 --> 01:20:03.581
That's what he told me.

1165
01:20:05.713 --> 01:20:06.758
What? He talked to you?

1166
01:20:08.542 --> 01:20:09.935
You were just gonna leave me
hanging as if I was
the only fool

1167
01:20:09.979 --> 01:20:11.632
that heard him speaking English?

1168
01:20:12.111 --> 01:20:15.114
Assuming just for a second
that he could be God.

1169
01:20:15.854 --> 01:20:19.466
why would he allow all of this
to happen? It's perplexing.

1170
01:20:19.858 --> 01:20:22.382
-Perhaps Brandt--
-Brandt is dead.

1171
01:20:22.426 --> 01:20:24.907
That's what I'm saying.
And I still can't forgive him.

1172
01:20:25.342 --> 01:20:29.868
Maybe you should just do what
the man says and just let it go.

1173
01:20:30.347 --> 01:20:31.435
I'm trying.

1174
01:20:32.218 --> 01:20:34.655
I say I forgive him.

1175
01:20:35.004 --> 01:20:36.135
but it's not real.

1176
01:20:42.359 --> 01:20:43.273
I'm here.

1177
01:20:45.710 --> 01:20:47.538
How long have I been asleep?

1178
01:20:48.626 --> 01:20:49.540
Long time.

1179
01:20:51.934 --> 01:20:53.196
Simon?

1180
01:20:53.892 --> 01:20:55.111
You're not dead.

1181
01:20:56.764 --> 01:21:00.246
Apparently the other timeline
didn't have much luck for me.

1182
01:21:01.073 --> 01:21:03.032
Are you hurt?

1183
01:21:04.337 --> 01:21:09.168
Uh. no. this is...
This is actually Jesus' blood.

1184
01:21:10.561 --> 01:21:11.910
What happened?

1185
01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:14.434
Can you take me to him?

1186
01:21:14.957 --> 01:21:16.045
It's too late.

1187
01:21:16.828 --> 01:21:18.569
He died on a cross.

1188
01:21:19.004 --> 01:21:22.312
-When?
-The day before yesterday.

1189
01:21:22.965 --> 01:21:24.183
Can you...

1190
01:21:24.749 --> 01:21:26.794
...take me to his tomb?

1191
01:21:27.534 --> 01:21:29.797
I want to see the resurrection.

1192
01:21:29.841 --> 01:21:32.409
-Resurrection?
-Please.

1193
01:21:34.977 --> 01:21:36.195
Help me get her up.

1194
01:21:45.770 --> 01:21:48.599
I really would have liked
to have killed you myself.

1195
01:21:57.738 --> 01:21:59.131
No need for concern.

1196
01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:07.270
Just getting
a little DNA for my lab.

1197
01:22:15.191 --> 01:22:17.628
Hey. that's gotta be it.

1198
01:22:20.239 --> 01:22:23.939
Amy. wake up. Hey. we're here.

1199
01:22:26.071 --> 01:22:27.420
That's it.

1200
01:22:34.993 --> 01:22:37.256
Hey. uh. are you feeling this?

1201
01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:39.215
It's happening.

1202
01:23:00.845 --> 01:23:01.846
He's risen.

1203
01:23:03.326 --> 01:23:05.937
It looks kind of like
a time transfer. I wonder if--

1204
01:23:05.981 --> 01:23:07.286
He's alive.

1205
01:23:08.157 --> 01:23:09.506
Go check it out.

1206
01:23:11.725 --> 01:23:13.727
Yeah. Come on.

1207
01:23:24.303 --> 01:23:26.131
Ahmed's men must
have stolen the body.

1208
01:23:27.089 --> 01:23:28.481
Man. you are in denial.

1209
01:23:28.873 --> 01:23:31.136
Why would Ahmed come in here.
steal the body.

1210
01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:33.138
and then neatly
fold up the linens?

1211
01:23:33.182 --> 01:23:34.618
Well. someone from
the future was here.

1212
01:23:34.661 --> 01:23:36.446
There are
glow sticks everywhere.

1213
01:23:36.837 --> 01:23:37.882
We have to clean this up.

1214
01:23:39.405 --> 01:23:40.319
Why. is that gonna mess
with the time continuum journey?

1215
01:23:40.363 --> 01:23:42.017
Yes. Exactly.

1216
01:23:50.895 --> 01:23:52.244
No...

1217
01:23:58.294 --> 01:24:00.035
It's okay. Amy.

1218
01:24:01.384 --> 01:24:03.386
It doesn't hurt anymore.

1219
01:24:04.865 --> 01:24:06.215
Thank you.

1220
01:24:08.565 --> 01:24:09.740
Why?

1221
01:24:11.176 --> 01:24:13.004
I don't understand.

1222
01:24:13.439 --> 01:24:16.747
Suppose a man has 100 sheep.

1223
01:24:17.748 --> 01:24:19.489
and one strays away.

1224
01:24:21.447 --> 01:24:25.495
Will he not leave the others
for a time to find the one?

1225
01:24:28.106 --> 01:24:29.629
And when he finds the one

1226
01:24:30.413 --> 01:24:32.589
and returns him safely home...

1227
01:24:33.938 --> 01:24:35.766
...will he not celebrate?

1228
01:24:53.610 --> 01:24:56.091
Ah. be careful.

1229
01:24:56.134 --> 01:24:58.354
You might be changing history.

1230
01:24:59.398 --> 01:25:01.705
Gone. Not here.

1231
01:25:03.228 --> 01:25:04.664
He has risen.

1232
01:25:09.930 --> 01:25:10.801
Yes.

1233
01:25:18.939 --> 01:25:20.115
Amy.

1234
01:25:20.985 --> 01:25:21.899
Hey.

1235
01:25:25.598 --> 01:25:26.469
Amy?

1236
01:25:53.322 --> 01:25:54.888
Ram. Ram!

1237
01:25:57.761 --> 01:25:58.718
Muchas gracias.

1238
01:26:03.201 --> 01:26:04.333
Thank you.

1239
01:26:08.511 --> 01:26:09.816
I can save her.

1240
01:26:13.907 --> 01:26:15.735
What are the odds
of that happening?

1241
01:26:17.172 --> 01:26:18.695
About a billion to one.

1242
01:26:19.522 --> 01:26:21.306
How did she end up
with a time retriever?

1243
01:26:21.959 --> 01:26:24.396
It must have been
Sabeer's or Brandt's.

1244
01:26:32.404 --> 01:26:34.232
It's time for my own
resurrection.

1245
01:26:37.148 --> 01:26:38.802
Ho-- hold on-- wait. hol--

1246
01:26:40.064 --> 01:26:41.326
You're not leaving me behind.

1247
01:26:41.370 --> 01:26:43.198
We could attempt
a double retrieval.

1248
01:26:43.981 --> 01:26:46.201
You mean. like.
when we retrieve for two people?

1249
01:26:47.071 --> 01:26:50.335
Mathematically. the odds
of that working are slim.

1250
01:26:50.379 --> 01:26:52.294
We might transfer into thin air.

1251
01:26:52.946 --> 01:26:55.297
And if we return successfully.
Ahmed will be waiting for us.

1252
01:26:55.340 --> 01:26:57.386
All right. stop sugar-coating.
let's go.

1253
01:27:00.737 --> 01:27:01.738
Take this.

1254
01:27:08.397 --> 01:27:09.746
Put your hand in here.

1255
01:27:13.184 --> 01:27:15.317
Three. two. one.

1256
01:27:22.498 --> 01:27:24.935
Hey! Oh. no. Simon.

1257
01:27:25.805 --> 01:27:27.590
I'll help you.

1258
01:27:27.633 --> 01:27:28.765
Oh.

1259
01:27:34.118 --> 01:27:36.425
Hang on.
I gotta deactivate the doors.

1260
01:27:50.613 --> 01:27:53.093
Don't worry. If I can run
the default program.

1261
01:27:53.137 --> 01:27:55.922
then none of what has happened
will have happened.

1262
01:27:56.314 --> 01:27:58.011
All these time continuums
will erase.

1263
01:28:01.101 --> 01:28:03.321
Einstein. initiate
mom and dad default.

1264
01:28:03.365 --> 01:28:04.583
Coordinates authorized.

1265
01:28:04.627 --> 01:28:06.150
Einstein. resync my retriever.

1266
01:28:06.193 --> 01:28:07.673
Retriever synced.

1267
01:28:11.155 --> 01:28:14.898
I gotta go.
The second I'm gone.
you have to destroy Einstein.

1268
01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:16.508
Fire into the hard drive.

1269
01:28:17.857 --> 01:28:19.642
Wait. Hey.

1270
01:28:22.601 --> 01:28:24.864
-Do you think he's legit?
-Who?

1271
01:28:26.039 --> 01:28:26.997
Jesus.

1272
01:28:28.346 --> 01:28:29.913
You're asking the wrong guy.

1273
01:28:40.271 --> 01:28:41.794
He said he believed he was God.

1274
01:28:43.013 --> 01:28:47.017
If he believed it.
then maybe you should too.

1275
01:28:48.801 --> 01:28:49.846
Should I?

1276
01:28:50.368 --> 01:28:51.891
He spoke English to you. man.

1277
01:28:52.501 --> 01:28:53.763
Who else could do that?

1278
01:28:57.201 --> 01:28:59.464
I'm mad at God for all of this.

1279
01:29:00.639 --> 01:29:03.294
How could I be mad
at something that doesn't exist?

1280
01:29:03.816 --> 01:29:06.471
Yeah. that's Ram logic.

1281
01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:11.346
I'm gonna fix this.

1282
01:29:12.216 --> 01:29:13.435
But if I can't...

1283
01:29:14.784 --> 01:29:17.047
...I'm sure he's got a place
for you in heaven.

1284
01:29:18.962 --> 01:29:22.705
It's probably a frat house...

1285
01:29:23.532 --> 01:29:25.360
...with lots of beer.

1286
01:29:27.274 --> 01:29:28.798
And sexy angels.

1287
01:29:32.715 --> 01:29:34.673
I think I like that.

1288
01:29:38.155 --> 01:29:39.112
Simon.

1289
01:29:40.418 --> 01:29:41.550
Simon!

1290
01:29:45.075 --> 01:29:46.468
I love you. brother.

1291
01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:56.956
-

1292
01:29:58.436 --> 01:29:59.524
Go after him!

1293
01:30:03.136 --> 01:30:04.442
You too. go.

1294
01:30:28.335 --> 01:30:29.554
Hmm.

1295
01:30:30.337 --> 01:30:32.383
You're so pathetic.

1296
01:30:32.427 --> 01:30:34.907
It's empty. imbecile.

1297
01:30:45.135 --> 01:30:46.179
Drop it.

1298
01:31:07.897 --> 01:31:10.987
Any last words before
I wipe that smirk off your face?

1299
01:31:11.378 --> 01:31:13.685
Chronologically speaking.

1300
01:31:13.729 --> 01:31:16.732
that would be an inaccurate
sequence of events.

1301
01:31:17.428 --> 01:31:18.908
You should go first.

1302
01:31:20.997 --> 01:31:23.608
-

1303
01:31:28.178 --> 01:31:32.269
-

1304
01:31:32.312 --> 01:31:33.444
Please.

1305
01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:35.664
I will kill your father
in seven seconds

1306
01:31:35.707 --> 01:31:37.622
if you do not give me that code.

1307
01:31:38.275 --> 01:31:40.799
Six. five...

1308
01:31:47.197 --> 01:31:48.633
Get down!

1309
01:31:53.638 --> 01:31:55.422
Hey. you alright?

1310
01:31:55.466 --> 01:31:58.164
We're fine. I've got a knife
in my front pocket.

1311
01:31:58.208 --> 01:31:59.601
Cut us loose.

1312
01:31:59.644 --> 01:32:01.820
Are you okay? What is going on?

1313
01:32:01.864 --> 01:32:03.561
I created a time machine.

1314
01:32:03.605 --> 01:32:05.824
-Ahmed used it to kill Jesus.
- What?

1315
01:32:05.868 --> 01:32:07.304
I have to go back
and kill Ahmed.

1316
01:32:07.347 --> 01:32:08.435
What?

1317
01:32:09.785 --> 01:32:11.787
-What are you talking about?
-I don't have time.

1318
01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:14.137
My time in this continuum
is expiring.

1319
01:32:14.572 --> 01:32:15.704
Bye.

1320
01:32:16.618 --> 01:32:17.662
Oh my God.

1321
01:32:20.056 --> 01:32:23.015
-Get Amy.
bring her to my office.
-I'm on it.

1322
01:32:24.408 --> 01:32:28.281
And you. I need proof.
I need something. Anything.

1323
01:32:28.717 --> 01:32:30.240
How can I trust in you?

1324
01:32:30.719 --> 01:32:32.329
You won't even show up.

1325
01:32:36.855 --> 01:32:40.424
Anything that happens
from this moment...

1326
01:32:42.644 --> 01:32:44.689
Brandt. meet me in my office.

1327
01:32:44.733 --> 01:32:46.909
Ram has escaped
and he's trying to kill me.

1328
01:33:24.468 --> 01:33:25.904
Toss your weapon over there.

1329
01:33:27.427 --> 01:33:28.385
Okay.

1330
01:33:34.913 --> 01:33:36.132
Get over there.

1331
01:33:36.959 --> 01:33:39.614
-Move.
-Be careful. be careful.

1332
01:33:42.965 --> 01:33:45.489
You killed my parents.
Now you're gonna pay.

1333
01:33:45.881 --> 01:33:48.318
I don't know what you're
talking about. It wasn't me.

1334
01:33:48.666 --> 01:33:49.928
You killed Amy.

1335
01:33:50.712 --> 01:33:52.670
Kid. I...
I haven't killed anyone.

1336
01:33:52.714 --> 01:33:54.367
You haven't done it yet.

1337
01:33:54.411 --> 01:33:55.455
But you're going to.

1338
01:33:55.804 --> 01:33:58.633
I would shoot you
right now but...

1339
01:34:00.069 --> 01:34:02.027
...but I can't get his words
out of my head.

1340
01:34:02.462 --> 01:34:03.420
Whose words?

1341
01:34:04.987 --> 01:34:06.205
All I was trying to do

1342
01:34:07.729 --> 01:34:09.339
is get trade secrets from you.
that you were stealing.

1343
01:34:10.296 --> 01:34:14.083
Whatever else happened...
that wasn't me.

1344
01:34:16.215 --> 01:34:17.173
Look. I...

1345
01:34:17.564 --> 01:34:19.001
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

1346
01:34:19.392 --> 01:34:21.699
You're just saying that
because I have a gun on you.

1347
01:34:28.750 --> 01:34:29.664
Kid.

1348
01:34:30.926 --> 01:34:32.971
I've lost everything
that I've ever loved.

1349
01:34:34.407 --> 01:34:36.018
I lost my wife.

1350
01:34:37.846 --> 01:34:39.804
I lost my little girls.

1351
01:34:40.849 --> 01:34:42.415
I'm doing things now that...

1352
01:34:44.635 --> 01:34:46.985
...I know that they would be
ashamed of me for.

1353
01:34:50.859 --> 01:34:52.077
Maybe you're right.

1354
01:34:52.121 --> 01:34:54.036
Maybe I do kill Amy. I--

1355
01:34:54.645 --> 01:34:56.081
I don't know anymore.

1356
01:34:58.736 --> 01:35:00.259
But you pulling that trigger?

1357
01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.393
You'll be doing me a favor.

1358
01:35:06.483 --> 01:35:07.397
So do it.

1359
01:35:08.572 --> 01:35:09.399
Do it.

1360
01:35:10.443 --> 01:35:12.228
You don't deserve
my forgiveness.

1361
01:35:14.578 --> 01:35:15.797
You hurt me.

1362
01:35:17.059 --> 01:35:18.408
You killed Amy.

1363
01:35:19.801 --> 01:35:21.280
You're right.

1364
01:35:22.804 --> 01:35:23.892
Please...

1365
01:35:26.633 --> 01:35:27.896
...send me to my family.

1366
01:35:28.331 --> 01:35:29.245
Shoot me.

1367
01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:31.464
Please.

1368
01:35:32.465 --> 01:35:34.859
Just do it. do it. do it.

1369
01:35:38.645 --> 01:35:42.737
I have to do this... for me.

1370
01:35:43.650 --> 01:35:44.956
For Amy.

1371
01:35:45.435 --> 01:35:46.784
I--

1372
01:35:49.091 --> 01:35:50.919
I forgive you.

1373
01:35:52.094 --> 01:35:55.793
I-- I for-- I forgive you.

1374
01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:04.106
I forgive you.

1375
01:36:12.636 --> 01:36:13.768
I did it.

1376
01:36:19.556 --> 01:36:21.471
Stay down. Stay down.

1377
01:36:27.956 --> 01:36:29.479
Dad. stop.

1378
01:36:30.523 --> 01:36:31.916
I chased Ahmed in here.

1379
01:36:40.882 --> 01:36:45.843
Drop your weapons
or I'll splatter her brains
all over the room.

1380
01:36:45.887 --> 01:36:47.671
Put your gun down
or I'll kill Brandt.

1381
01:36:51.544 --> 01:36:53.285
Be my guest.

1382
01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:57.768
- Ram!

1383
01:36:58.334 --> 01:36:59.465
Get the gun.

1384
01:37:04.166 --> 01:37:07.386
You know I'll stop at nothing
to get the secret
to time travel.

1385
01:37:09.998 --> 01:37:11.564
We've been through this before.

1386
01:37:13.088 --> 01:37:14.393
Go ahead and kill them.

1387
01:37:15.090 --> 01:37:17.483
He is lying. Let me just--

1388
01:37:18.441 --> 01:37:21.009
Forgive me
if I don't believe you.

1389
01:37:22.053 --> 01:37:24.142
-

1390
01:37:24.186 --> 01:37:25.927
- No!

1391
01:37:28.712 --> 01:37:30.888
-Either give me the code.

1392
01:37:30.932 --> 01:37:33.325
or his next shot will be
in her kneecaps.

1393
01:37:33.369 --> 01:37:34.370
Which is it?

1394
01:37:36.894 --> 01:37:37.852
Fine by me.

1395
01:37:39.070 --> 01:37:42.378
-Six. five...
- Stop. please. stop.

1396
01:37:45.250 --> 01:37:47.209
Who... who's talking to me?

1397
01:37:47.252 --> 01:37:49.341
Stop playing games.

1398
01:37:50.255 --> 01:37:52.649
No game.
I'm hearing a woman's voice.

1399
01:37:56.218 --> 01:37:58.394
She wants me
to deliver a message.

1400
01:37:59.395 --> 01:38:01.876
Okay. I'll play
your little game.

1401
01:38:01.919 --> 01:38:03.486
What's the message?

1402
01:38:10.058 --> 01:38:11.233
"Be a hero."

1403
01:38:12.451 --> 01:38:15.541
How sweet.
but totally irrelevant.

1404
01:38:15.585 --> 01:38:19.545
-Four. three...
-Stop. please. Just...

1405
01:38:19.589 --> 01:38:20.764
Change of heart?

1406
01:38:20.807 --> 01:38:23.419
Yes. yes.

1407
01:38:24.681 --> 01:38:25.551
Yes.

1408
01:38:28.903 --> 01:38:31.340
Please. I forgave Brandt.

1409
01:38:31.731 --> 01:38:35.257
If you're ever gonna show up.
now is the time.

1410
01:38:35.692 --> 01:38:36.911
Please.

1411
01:38:37.433 --> 01:38:39.043
-

1412
01:38:40.218 --> 01:38:41.611
How touching.

1413
01:38:41.959 --> 01:38:43.961
Two. one.

1414
01:38:54.232 --> 01:38:56.191
If you die before telling me.

1415
01:38:57.018 --> 01:39:01.457
I guarantee you they'll be
cursing your name from day
after day of torture.

1416
01:39:02.284 --> 01:39:06.331
No matter what I do...
you will still kill us all.

1417
01:39:09.856 --> 01:39:10.901
True.

1418
01:39:12.207 --> 01:39:15.427
But if you give me my code.
they die quickly.

1419
01:39:15.471 --> 01:39:18.082
Say goodbye to your mother.

1420
01:39:19.475 --> 01:39:21.042
No.
- Please.

1421
01:39:30.355 --> 01:39:32.618
You forgave Brandt! Forgive me!

1422
01:39:32.662 --> 01:39:36.971
Don't worry. you'll only be dead
in this time continuum.

1423
01:39:52.029 --> 01:39:53.683
Someone...

1424
01:39:54.249 --> 01:39:55.554
...roll me over.

1425
01:39:58.905 --> 01:40:00.516
Are you unable?

1426
01:40:01.908 --> 01:40:03.475
I-- I can't feel anything.

1427
01:40:08.828 --> 01:40:10.047
Move my head.

1428
01:40:12.180 --> 01:40:14.704
-Push the button on my jacket.
- Okay.

1429
01:40:16.053 --> 01:40:17.011
Urgent.

1430
01:40:17.533 --> 01:40:19.361
Everyone lay down your weapons.

1431
01:40:19.796 --> 01:40:21.145
Dr. McCoy.

1432
01:40:21.189 --> 01:40:23.278
-Yes. sir. I'm here.
- It's okay.

1433
01:40:24.496 --> 01:40:26.716
Ahmed. Sabeer. Kabil...

1434
01:40:28.892 --> 01:40:32.809
...and the in-house agents
are part of a terrorist network.

1435
01:40:34.245 --> 01:40:35.768
Champion Nashville...

1436
01:40:36.465 --> 01:40:38.815
-...is now in control.
-Copy that. sir. We're on it.

1437
01:40:41.078 --> 01:40:43.689
-

1438
01:40:48.172 --> 01:40:49.434
Ram?

1439
01:40:51.132 --> 01:40:52.394
Was it her?

1440
01:40:52.872 --> 01:40:54.787
-Who?
-Diane?

1441
01:40:56.702 --> 01:40:57.747
My wife.

1442
01:40:58.182 --> 01:41:00.271
Was she the voice you heard?

1443
01:41:01.272 --> 01:41:02.360
I-- I don't know.

1444
01:41:05.102 --> 01:41:06.451
British accent?

1445
01:41:09.237 --> 01:41:10.412
It's her.

1446
01:41:11.804 --> 01:41:14.285
Hang on. we're gonna get you
some help.

1447
01:41:14.329 --> 01:41:15.765
I don't have much time.

1448
01:41:16.244 --> 01:41:17.593
I need to know something.

1449
01:41:18.333 --> 01:41:19.595
Did I fix time?

1450
01:41:21.292 --> 01:41:22.728
Was it broken?

1451
01:41:22.772 --> 01:41:24.600
Yeah. badly.

1452
01:41:25.253 --> 01:41:29.431
Use your bible app
to read to me what happened
when they captured Jesus.

1453
01:41:34.131 --> 01:41:35.263
Okay.

1454
01:41:36.133 --> 01:41:39.093
"The man sees Jesus
and arrested him.

1455
01:41:39.136 --> 01:41:40.964
Then one of those standing near

1456
01:41:41.007 --> 01:41:44.750
drew his sword and struck
the servant of the high priest.

1457
01:41:44.794 --> 01:41:45.795
cutting off his ear."

1458
01:41:46.404 --> 01:41:47.884
Good. keep going.

1459
01:41:48.276 --> 01:41:50.843
"'Am I leading a rebellion?'.
said Jesus.

1460
01:41:51.192 --> 01:41:53.150
'that you have
come out with swords--'"

1461
01:41:53.194 --> 01:41:54.543
Skip that part.

1462
01:41:55.674 --> 01:41:57.676
"Then everyone
deserted him and fled.

1463
01:41:58.286 --> 01:42:03.160
A young man. wearing nothing
but a linen garment.
was following Jesus.

1464
01:42:03.639 --> 01:42:06.163
When they seized him.
he fled naked.

1465
01:42:06.207 --> 01:42:08.339
leaving his garment behind."

1466
01:42:11.299 --> 01:42:15.259
Tell him...
that we made history.

1467
01:42:16.042 --> 01:42:17.479
Tell who?

1468
01:42:29.969 --> 01:42:33.843
Remember the me
that was tied to the chair
in the original timeline?

1469
01:42:33.886 --> 01:42:36.106
Hey. guys. I think
you're gonna want to see this.

1470
01:42:36.150 --> 01:42:37.977
Well. this is me.

1471
01:42:46.334 --> 01:42:47.683
What just happened?

1472
01:42:48.162 --> 01:42:49.511
It's complicated.

1473
01:42:51.208 --> 01:42:52.992
I can't believe I let
you guys talk me into this.

1474
01:42:53.036 --> 01:42:55.473
Amy is convinced
that God allowed

1475
01:42:55.517 --> 01:42:56.909
everything that happened.

1476
01:42:56.953 --> 01:42:58.650
so that one man. Brandt.

1477
01:42:58.694 --> 01:43:00.435
would find his way back to God.

1478
01:43:00.478 --> 01:43:03.307
But he is now a paraplegic.

1479
01:43:03.351 --> 01:43:05.004
Not that I cared
that much about Brandt.

1480
01:43:05.048 --> 01:43:07.703
but from a purely
scientific perspective.

1481
01:43:07.746 --> 01:43:09.661
even the slightest
changes we made

1482
01:43:09.705 --> 01:43:12.838
traveling into the past
might have changed the present.

1483
01:43:12.882 --> 01:43:15.580
So if I could change
one small event

1484
01:43:15.624 --> 01:43:19.367
and restore everything
exactly the way it was. then...

1485
01:43:19.410 --> 01:43:21.630
-Hey. Be careful.
-...shouldn't I?

1486
01:43:22.500 --> 01:43:24.198
I'm like the smartest man
in the world.

1487
01:43:24.241 --> 01:43:25.373
What could possibly go wrong?

1488
01:43:25.416 --> 01:43:27.462
Okay. smartest man in the world.

1489
01:43:27.505 --> 01:43:29.115
Aren't you forgetting something?

1490
01:43:29.681 --> 01:43:31.857
I'm sorry. I love you.

1491
01:43:31.901 --> 01:43:35.426
And I love you.
but that's not
what you're forgetting.

1492
01:43:36.819 --> 01:43:39.038
That's not what
you're forgetting either.

1493
01:43:39.082 --> 01:43:40.562
Oh! You want to pray.

1494
01:43:41.084 --> 01:43:44.914
I probably should be praying
for you right now. but...

1495
01:43:49.397 --> 01:43:51.747
Right. thank God for you.

1496
01:43:52.356 --> 01:43:53.792
You should try to remember that.

1497
01:43:54.271 --> 01:43:56.317
Theoretically. I won't be able
to remember any of this

1498
01:43:56.360 --> 01:43:58.449
since the time continuum
is gonna--

1499
01:44:02.323 --> 01:44:04.586
Get off me. man. Get off me.

1500
01:44:06.892 --> 01:44:08.503
-Go.
-Okay.

1501
01:44:09.155 --> 01:44:10.244
Felix. fire it up.

1502
01:44:23.909 --> 01:44:25.476
I'm so sorry.

1503
01:44:27.435 --> 01:44:31.265
This job requires you
to have the ability
to do things that you can't.

1504
01:44:32.309 --> 01:44:33.571
I didn't know.

1505
01:44:34.485 --> 01:44:36.357
But I promise
I'll keep you in mind

1506
01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:38.097
if we ever need
an online consultant.

1507
01:44:38.446 --> 01:44:39.534
That's fine.

1508
01:44:43.146 --> 01:44:44.408
Video off.

1509
01:44:47.324 --> 01:44:48.412
Back to.

1510
01:44:54.157 --> 01:44:55.854
I'm the hero to others.

1511
01:44:59.162 --> 01:45:00.468
But I get nothing.

1512
01:45:06.343 --> 01:45:07.475
Please...

1513
01:45:09.607 --> 01:45:10.826
...have mercy.

1514
01:45:15.526 --> 01:45:16.875
Take me home.

1515
01:45:23.186 --> 01:45:24.622
You may not be saving the world.

1516
01:45:25.101 --> 01:45:26.668
but you're a hero to them

1517
01:45:27.625 --> 01:45:30.498
and you're my hero too. darling.

1518
01:45:32.543 --> 01:45:34.153
That British accent.

1519
01:45:38.897 --> 01:45:39.855
Hey...

1520
01:45:40.638 --> 01:45:41.987
...you okay?

1521
01:45:42.727 --> 01:45:45.556
I'm having this feeling...

1522
01:45:46.383 --> 01:45:52.781
...that God is going to do
something really
miraculous through you.

1523
01:45:55.436 --> 01:45:58.569
-

1524
01:46:05.402 --> 01:46:07.448
-You guys okay?
-We are.

1525
01:46:14.933 --> 01:46:17.936
-Am I seeing things?
-No. I saw him too.

1526
01:46:18.459 --> 01:46:21.549
Me too. He saved us. Daddy.

1527
01:46:22.201 --> 01:46:23.202
Was he an angel?

1528
01:46:24.465 --> 01:46:26.597
Girl. I don't know
what that was.

1529
01:46:27.598 --> 01:46:29.295
It is from Goldstein.

1530
01:46:29.687 --> 01:46:33.082
I think he's one of the kid
geniuses from the lab.

1531
01:46:37.739 --> 01:46:42.744
"Confidential. You are going
to need the FBI
and Homeland Security.

1532
01:46:44.093 --> 01:46:45.137
PS..."

1533
01:46:49.577 --> 01:46:51.013
"Time to be a hero."

1534
01:46:56.671 --> 01:46:58.629
Girls. I don't know what
just happened. but...

1535
01:46:59.413 --> 01:47:01.589
...I think God was
looking out for our family.

1536
01:47:20.651 --> 01:47:22.436
Stop! Wait.

1537
01:47:25.613 --> 01:47:31.401
On the back of the stop sign.
there was a second envelope
addressed to me.

1538
01:47:31.445 --> 01:47:35.666
The jump drive inside had
all the encrypted secrets
to time travel.

1539
01:47:36.319 --> 01:47:40.192
So I secretly built
another time machine.

1540
01:47:40.236 --> 01:47:43.108
This time I used it
to make billions.

1541
01:47:43.152 --> 01:47:48.070
So I could buy a starter home
and a small boat.

1542
01:47:48.462 --> 01:47:53.031
Curiosity overwhelmed me
and I sneaked a peek
at the future.

1543
01:47:53.075 --> 01:47:57.601
Recall when they gunned down
Amy and myself in lab 19?

1544
01:47:57.645 --> 01:47:59.560
Well...

1545
01:48:03.564 --> 01:48:05.000
What is she doing?

1546
01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:07.829
Sign language.

1547
01:48:08.482 --> 01:48:10.353
Okay. but what is she saying?

1548
01:48:11.093 --> 01:48:13.835
She is saying you're a moron.

1549
01:48:15.053 --> 01:48:17.012
How would she even know that?

1550
01:48:25.890 --> 01:48:27.022
Targets are down.

1551
01:48:28.589 --> 01:48:29.677
Let's go.

1552
01:48:48.391 --> 01:48:49.871
Amy.

1553
01:48:55.529 --> 01:48:56.704
Amy?

1554
01:49:01.447 --> 01:49:04.407
I'm gonna fix this.
I'm gonna get you help.

1555
01:49:17.333 --> 01:49:18.726
30 years into the future.

1556
01:49:19.117 --> 01:49:24.949
Emergency entrance.
Metro City Community Hospital.

1557
01:49:26.995 --> 01:49:30.912
Initiate in one minute.
Delete all files.

1558
01:49:42.663 --> 01:49:43.925
I got you.

1559
01:49:53.891 --> 01:49:57.721
We transferred
to the future.
but we weren't the only ones.

1560
01:49:57.765 --> 01:50:00.158
The Ahmed that was
in Jesus' tomb

1561
01:50:00.202 --> 01:50:03.901
also transported
before his timeline expired.

1562
01:50:03.945 --> 01:50:07.209
He brought Jesus' DNA with him.

1563
01:50:07.252 --> 01:50:10.778
Well. he was able
to clone Jesus.

1564
01:50:11.343 --> 01:50:13.911
Now this new Jesus
can raise the dead.

1565
01:50:13.955 --> 01:50:16.435
levitate objects.
manipulate the weather.

1566
01:50:16.479 --> 01:50:19.221
change molecular
structures and more.

1567
01:50:19.830 --> 01:50:22.572
Only one big problem:

1568
01:50:23.138 --> 01:50:26.663
he's quite
the opposite of Jesus.

1569
01:50:27.533 --> 01:50:29.753
That must be why they call him

1570
01:50:30.493 --> 01:50:32.321
the Anti-Christ.
