3
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.094
What do
you know about marijuana?

4
00:00:51.225 --> 00:00:53.009
What do you think you know?

5
00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.273
It's come a long way since
dime bags and Cheech and Chong.

6
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.885
For starters. it's becoming
a 200 billion dollar industry

7
00:01:00.016 --> 00:01:02.627
as well as the number one
agricultural crop in California.

8
00:01:04.107 --> 00:01:05.369
I'm a dispensary
owner in Los Angeles.

9
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.067
meaning. I sell weed.

10
00:01:07.197 --> 00:01:08.372
and California knows about it.

11
00:01:10.635 --> 00:01:12.246
We don't call
it marijuana anymore. though.

12
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:13.943
It's called flower.

13
00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:15.988
like the plant you give
your mother or cannabis.

14
00:01:18.426 --> 00:01:21.994
That's Franco. a working-class
dude just like the rest of us.

15
00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:24.258
except he grows for one
of the best suppliers in LA.

16
00:01:24.388 --> 00:01:25.781
- Looks good.
- I know.

17
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.219
You'd be bounded too if you saw
the profit margin on this stuff.

18
00:01:38.054 --> 00:01:40.012
The demand was so high
I had to hire delivery drivers.

19
00:01:40.143 --> 00:01:41.884
You show ID. you get your weed.

20
00:01:42.014 --> 00:01:43.320
It was that simple.

21
00:01:43.451 --> 00:01:44.582
No longer have to
feel like a schmuck

22
00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:45.844
doing deliveries in my car.

23
00:01:45.931 --> 00:01:48.238
The money was just pouring in.

24
00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.849
It was like the wild west and
the heavy one was staking
their claims.

25
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.329
We even called
it. the green rush.

26
00:01:54.201 --> 00:01:55.376
Here's a normal
day buying wholesale.

27
00:01:55.506 --> 00:01:57.508
Flying the Cessna
was my buddy. Cada.

28
00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:59.945
I'd meet him at
Santa Paula Airport at 9 AM

29
00:02:00.076 --> 00:02:02.122
and we could either
go to Humboldt County

30
00:02:02.252 --> 00:02:04.559
or Inland Farm County by 11.

31
00:02:04.646 --> 00:02:06.561
Today. we're going Inland.

32
00:02:06.691 --> 00:02:09.216
When I started as
a grower 5 years ago.

33
00:02:09.346 --> 00:02:12.262
I never would have imagined
it would turn out to be
something like this.

34
00:02:12.393 --> 00:02:14.786
Farming technology
has advanced immeasurably.

35
00:02:14.917 --> 00:02:16.658
and these Inland growers
have given the folks in Humboldt

36
00:02:16.788 --> 00:02:18.616
a run for their their money.

37
00:02:18.747 --> 00:02:21.663
They're harvesting buttloads
of stuff in the desert.

38
00:02:21.793 --> 00:02:23.795
Think of the sand
where water doesn't exist.

39
00:02:23.926 --> 00:02:25.928
Man. the crops
are great this year.

40
00:02:26.015 --> 00:02:29.149
Thank you. this is tricom
production like donkey dicks.

41
00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:31.890
At noon. I buy
a barrel straight from one

42
00:02:32.021 --> 00:02:33.675
of the friendly local growers.

43
00:02:33.805 --> 00:02:36.199
have it packed into
a van and driven down to LA.

44
00:02:36.286 --> 00:02:39.507
Why bother growing it when it's
as easy to get your hands on
this stuff?

45
00:02:39.637 --> 00:02:41.248
You see that plastic bag?

46
00:02:41.378 --> 00:02:43.554
That's 50 pounds of dried bud

47
00:02:43.685 --> 00:02:46.731
and behind me.
a 197 barrels full of them.

48
00:02:46.862 --> 00:02:49.995
Street value. $19 million.

49
00:02:50.126 --> 00:02:52.694
You could fit a small
body in one of those barrels.

50
00:02:52.824 --> 00:02:55.175
I hop back on
a plane. shoot back to LA.

51
00:02:55.305 --> 00:02:57.699
buy a couple of bags off
the runway just because I could.

52
00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.919
And then I'm back in time to
grab a late lunch at
Santa Monica.

53
00:03:01.006 --> 00:03:02.921
I had this down to a science.

54
00:03:03.052 --> 00:03:05.446
Keep in mind. absolutely none
of this was federally legal.

55
00:03:07.056 --> 00:03:08.753
I met this young
kid. Bobby. at court.

56
00:03:08.884 --> 00:03:10.102
He was there for
beating up this guy

57
00:03:10.233 --> 00:03:11.843
who beat up his little sister.

58
00:03:11.974 --> 00:03:13.193
Good kid and he came
with some valuable skills.

59
00:03:14.585 --> 00:03:17.022
Just the kind of guy I needed.

60
00:03:17.153 --> 00:03:19.547
We quickly bonded and after
a few months.
he started working for me.

61
00:03:22.071 --> 00:03:24.029
He also worked in collections.

62
00:03:24.116 --> 00:03:25.509
So I asked him to do the job
they didn't want to do anymore.

63
00:03:27.163 --> 00:03:28.860
On the streets.
where there are no rules.

64
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.865
it's important people respect
you and pay their debts on time.

65
00:03:33.952 --> 00:03:35.519
I was never a dealer before

66
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.478
and I still don't
consider myself as one.

67
00:03:37.565 --> 00:03:39.784
It was only after my
mother and me moved out west

68
00:03:39.915 --> 00:03:42.091
that I started growing
vegetables for some sort of
therapy.

69
00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:44.049
I was pretty good at it

70
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.530
so I stopped picking the weeds
and started growing them.

71
00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:49.881
The money was so good
that I stop growing altogether
and just sold it.

72
00:03:50.012 --> 00:03:53.320
No longer that I need
a plan B. this was my only plan.

73
00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.236
So how could
something so right go so wrong?

74
00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:00.762
We want to turn to
the historic night here in
California.

75
00:04:00.892 --> 00:04:02.894
What affects you the most?

76
00:04:02.981 --> 00:04:05.157
Yeah. voters legalized the
recreational use of marijuana.

77
00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:08.030
Here's a look at
the Prop 64 results.

78
00:04:08.117 --> 00:04:10.337
You think weed turning
legal would be a good thing.

79
00:04:10.467 --> 00:04:11.599
Think again.

80
00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:12.817
My sales tank.

81
00:04:12.904 --> 00:04:14.384
my drivers are leaving.

82
00:04:14.515 --> 00:04:16.125
and I can't get
a dispensary license

83
00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:18.562
even though the state
promised thousands of them.

84
00:04:18.693 --> 00:04:21.043
So then. people started telling
me. "Get a loan. Try to stay
afloat."

85
00:04:21.173 --> 00:04:22.653
Not a chance.

86
00:04:22.784 --> 00:04:24.307
Cannabis may now be
legal on a state level

87
00:04:24.394 --> 00:04:26.004
but not on the federal level.

88
00:04:26.135 --> 00:04:28.137
Things won't even
give you a lollipop

89
00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:29.617
for walking through the front
door and nonetheless a loan.

90
00:04:29.747 --> 00:04:30.748
Of course. there
was money involved in it.

91
00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:32.184
This is politics.

92
00:04:32.315 --> 00:04:33.273
Politics. pot.
money. okay?

93
00:04:33.403 --> 00:04:35.275
Then the big shot politicians

94
00:04:35.405 --> 00:04:37.189
add testing regulations

95
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.191
which up all
the prices for everyone.

96
00:04:39.322 --> 00:04:41.933
Look. I get it.
California wants to be legit

97
00:04:42.064 --> 00:04:43.718
and people want safe weed

98
00:04:43.805 --> 00:04:45.154
but the folks
growing your genetically

99
00:04:45.241 --> 00:04:47.069
modified breakfast cereals.

100
00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.027
have less red tape to
cut through than my industry.

101
00:04:51.116 --> 00:04:52.683
So I'm forced to pay off
these shady cameras inspectors.

102
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.034
back alleys.
just so I can stay open.

103
00:04:56.121 --> 00:04:58.167
Maybe it's time to
pull up the stakes and move on

104
00:04:58.254 --> 00:05:00.561
because the end of
the green rush was within sight.

105
00:05:23.801 --> 00:05:25.455
I think I need a plan B.

106
00:05:27.065 --> 00:05:28.980
You just got to
get your swagger back.

107
00:05:30.634 --> 00:05:32.288
Who said I lost my swagger?

108
00:05:34.246 --> 00:05:35.291
You got this.

109
00:05:54.484 --> 00:05:55.616
Someone had an order?

110
00:05:55.746 --> 00:05:56.878
You're the delivery guy?

111
00:05:59.271 --> 00:06:00.316
Marcus here?

112
00:06:00.447 --> 00:06:01.709
Yeah. Come in.

113
00:06:03.145 --> 00:06:06.017
Marcus.
the delivery guy is here.

114
00:06:24.558 --> 00:06:25.689
I got this. ladies.

115
00:06:29.084 --> 00:06:30.738
Delivery guy.

116
00:06:30.868 --> 00:06:31.739
You ordered an ounce?

117
00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:32.740
Yes. I did.

118
00:06:34.524 --> 00:06:36.396
I need a card and ID.

119
00:06:36.526 --> 00:06:38.049
What are you talking about?

120
00:06:38.136 --> 00:06:39.311
ID. I need to
make sure it's you.

121
00:06:41.313 --> 00:06:42.402
Here we go like the only
company with some shit. man.

122
00:06:43.664 --> 00:06:45.405
Yeah. I do.

123
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:49.539
Fine. yeah. Yeah. my bad.

124
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:51.149
Hey. Britney!

125
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.587
Britney. bring my
ID up here. Please.

126
00:06:56.024 --> 00:06:57.721
Girls. man. Right?

127
00:06:59.244 --> 00:07:00.768
So this place is yours. huh?

128
00:07:00.898 --> 00:07:03.510
Yeah. man. Yeah. Paid
in full. Very sick. huh?

129
00:07:04.772 --> 00:07:05.773
Hey. thank you.

130
00:07:08.645 --> 00:07:09.777
Lastly. my card.

131
00:07:09.907 --> 00:07:11.213
Got it.

132
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:13.345
There's that.

133
00:07:13.476 --> 00:07:14.259
Alright. - Appreciate you.

134
00:07:16.218 --> 00:07:17.132
Okay. hold on
a minute. I have a tip for you.

135
00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.831
That's balcony for my
show tonight. Come through. man.

136
00:07:20.962 --> 00:07:22.920
Good times. bring
a friend. Lots of girls.

137
00:07:23.051 --> 00:07:23.530
Yeah.

138
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:24.400
Bye.

139
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:27.534
Let's get high.

140
00:07:46.944 --> 00:07:49.556
Hey. thanks for meeting up.

141
00:07:49.686 --> 00:07:50.600
You bet.

142
00:07:50.731 --> 00:07:52.428
Just to be clear.

143
00:07:52.515 --> 00:07:53.864
this is going to cover
all my unregulated products

144
00:07:53.995 --> 00:07:55.736
and no bureau coming
by for routine checks.

145
00:07:55.866 --> 00:07:57.868
Why do you want to ask
me specific shit like that. man?

146
00:07:57.955 --> 00:07:59.087
Makes me feel
like you're tapped.

147
00:07:59.217 --> 00:08:00.741
Are you serious?

148
00:08:02.046 --> 00:08:03.178
You got the cash? Come here.

149
00:08:04.396 --> 00:08:05.049
Here.

150
00:08:07.312 --> 00:08:09.184
Okay. This will
cover you for 6 months.

151
00:08:09.314 --> 00:08:11.316
No regulations will be enforced.

152
00:08:11.447 --> 00:08:13.057
Yeah. but I can
sell any flower I want.

153
00:08:13.188 --> 00:08:15.277
Yes. Just don't be stupid.

154
00:08:15.407 --> 00:08:17.366
I still have to
come by for inspections.

155
00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:18.889
But only you. right?

156
00:08:21.196 --> 00:08:21.370
I don't want to have to pay
off any other inspectors. again.

157
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:23.459
Only me.

158
00:08:25.069 --> 00:08:26.288
Hey. what about
my dispensary license?

159
00:08:26.418 --> 00:08:27.550
What about it?

160
00:08:27.681 --> 00:08:28.943
When's
it going to get approved?

161
00:08:31.032 --> 00:08:32.816
You still got
your delivery license. right?

162
00:08:32.947 --> 00:08:35.471
Yeah. but my business.
it depends on the dispensary
license.

163
00:08:37.255 --> 00:08:38.518
I don't make
the rules of the state. buddy.

164
00:08:38.605 --> 00:08:39.780
I just enforce them.

165
00:08:42.783 --> 00:08:43.523
Keep applying.

166
00:08:57.624 --> 00:08:58.755
What's up?

167
00:08:58.842 --> 00:09:01.062
The AC is broken again. Vince.

168
00:09:01.149 --> 00:09:01.932
Get off your phone.

169
00:09:03.368 --> 00:09:05.196
Look. I don't know.

170
00:09:05.327 --> 00:09:07.895
You had 10. You come
back with 7 and the money for 2?

171
00:09:08.025 --> 00:09:09.592
It must have gotten lost.

172
00:09:10.637 --> 00:09:11.507
What is going on?

173
00:09:11.638 --> 00:09:12.508
He lost a bag.

174
00:09:12.595 --> 00:09:13.770
How big?

175
00:09:13.857 --> 00:09:15.729
An 8? He's gonna break my arm.

176
00:09:15.859 --> 00:09:17.513
Okay. Jesus. man. Let him go.

177
00:09:17.644 --> 00:09:18.601
Are you serious?

178
00:09:18.732 --> 00:09:20.081
Let him go.

179
00:09:22.692 --> 00:09:24.128
Cumming. go look in your car.

180
00:09:24.259 --> 00:09:25.565
See if you can find it.

181
00:09:25.695 --> 00:09:26.435
He smoked it.
He's not going to

182
00:09:26.522 --> 00:09:27.262
fucking find it. Vince.

183
00:09:27.349 --> 00:09:27.915
Just go look.

184
00:09:29.177 --> 00:09:30.091
Thank you. Vince.

185
00:09:31.788 --> 00:09:32.528
Get the fuck out of here.

186
00:09:33.529 --> 00:09:34.225
What the fuck?

187
00:09:36.401 --> 00:09:38.012
He's our last driver.

188
00:09:38.142 --> 00:09:39.579
He's probably
going to fucking quit.

189
00:09:39.709 --> 00:09:41.624
That was his fourth time.

190
00:09:41.755 --> 00:09:43.017
You've got to let these
people know who's running shit.

191
00:09:43.147 --> 00:09:44.235
The guy's got
a kid. for God's sake.

192
00:09:44.366 --> 00:09:45.933
That's not my problem.

193
00:09:46.063 --> 00:09:46.760
We are running
the business. right?

194
00:09:48.283 --> 00:09:49.676
Where the fuck
is Samson? He quit?

195
00:09:49.806 --> 00:09:51.068
Yeah. he quit.

196
00:09:52.853 --> 00:09:55.595
Hey. look. I love
you. You know this. right?

197
00:09:55.725 --> 00:09:57.858
I brought you in
here as my partner to help.

198
00:09:57.988 --> 00:10:01.426
Right now. financially.
we're getting fucking crushed.

199
00:10:01.557 --> 00:10:02.732
Okay?

200
00:10:02.863 --> 00:10:07.302
Hey. hey. just help us. Okay?

201
00:10:10.131 --> 00:10:11.393
Fine.

202
00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:28.628
Oh. dandelions.

203
00:10:30.368 --> 00:10:31.369
Yeah. I feel like
I've never been there.

204
00:10:31.456 --> 00:10:32.849
Yo. I'm telling you.

205
00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.329
These regulations
are killing us even with

206
00:10:34.459 --> 00:10:36.592
the help of the Cannabis Bureau.

207
00:10:36.723 --> 00:10:39.247
But I meant these
Armenians that have good quality

208
00:10:39.377 --> 00:10:40.596
bud that we can buy.

209
00:10:40.727 --> 00:10:41.466
Cheap.

210
00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:43.294
That quickly. huh?

211
00:10:43.425 --> 00:10:44.469
I like Armenians.

212
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.862
And we can sell it for triple.

213
00:10:47.168 --> 00:10:48.169
I'm trying to set up a meeting.

214
00:10:49.953 --> 00:10:51.215
How long you known these guys?

215
00:10:51.868 --> 00:10:52.956
Not long.

216
00:10:54.436 --> 00:10:55.916
But they are all
over the street though.

217
00:10:57.961 --> 00:10:58.962
I get the feeling you're
gonna set up no matter what.

218
00:10:59.093 --> 00:11:00.355
What the fuck?

219
00:11:00.485 --> 00:11:02.531
What are you looking at?

220
00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:03.663
I've been looking for this
motherfucker everywhere.
Hold on.

221
00:11:03.793 --> 00:11:04.751
Is he serious?

222
00:11:06.013 --> 00:11:07.144
Here's Ricky.

223
00:11:07.275 --> 00:11:09.103
Who's Ricky?

224
00:11:09.233 --> 00:11:10.365
He's this Junior Agent
with ICM. I'll be back.

225
00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:16.327
You want some?

226
00:11:18.155 --> 00:11:19.330
I'm good. Enjoy.

227
00:11:44.007 --> 00:11:44.660
Hide this.

228
00:11:46.749 --> 00:11:48.272
I'll text you tomorrow
with the Armenians info.

229
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:50.187
Really?

230
00:11:55.105 --> 00:11:56.106
That was really
good seeing you again.

231
00:11:56.237 --> 00:11:57.281
Yeah. Thanks again.

232
00:11:58.848 --> 00:12:00.415
No problem.

233
00:12:00.502 --> 00:12:02.286
Go ahead and give me
a call. We'll set it up.

234
00:12:02.417 --> 00:12:03.592
I will. Thanks again
for helping. I appreciate it.

235
00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:04.636
No problem. - Okay.

236
00:12:06.813 --> 00:12:07.814
Hey. baby. - Hey. babe.

237
00:12:08.858 --> 00:12:10.425
What's going on?

238
00:12:10.555 --> 00:12:11.469
I don't know.

239
00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:14.429
That guy looks
like he's injured.

240
00:12:14.559 --> 00:12:16.039
Nah. you think so?

241
00:12:16.126 --> 00:12:18.172
Yeah. we should
probably get out of here.

242
00:12:18.302 --> 00:12:19.651
That's a very good idea.

243
00:12:33.709 --> 00:12:34.579
So are you going to
meet with those Armenians?

244
00:12:36.364 --> 00:12:37.452
I don't know.
I got to find out some more

245
00:12:37.582 --> 00:12:38.192
information with these guys.

246
00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:39.802
I mean you should.

247
00:12:39.889 --> 00:12:41.151
It'd be good for your business.

248
00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.155
Don't worry about my
business. I gotta handle this.

249
00:12:47.418 --> 00:12:48.593
Okay. I mean I'm just
looking towards the future.

250
00:12:49.681 --> 00:12:50.770
Me too.

251
00:12:52.641 --> 00:12:53.773
Speaking of. what's up
with Ricky with his suit jacket?

252
00:12:56.558 --> 00:12:58.125
Ricky. he just wanted to talk
to me. see if I was interested
in a part.

253
00:12:58.212 --> 00:12:59.169
A part?

254
00:13:00.867 --> 00:13:02.303
Yeah. he saw my
reel and was curious.

255
00:13:02.433 --> 00:13:04.174
I mean. what is
this. 21 Questions?

256
00:13:04.261 --> 00:13:05.654
No. I'm just curious.

257
00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:07.177
No. you're
not. You're probing.

258
00:13:08.744 --> 00:13:09.658
Tab. I'm not
probing. - Yes. you are.

259
00:13:10.354 --> 00:13:12.095
Fuck. Vince.

260
00:13:12.226 --> 00:13:14.794
Hey. hey. I'm sorry.
alright? I trust you. I-

261
00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:18.406
Things are just crazy right now.

262
00:13:18.493 --> 00:13:20.800
Yeah. with
work? I mean. I can tell.

263
00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:22.845
It's taken a toll on
you and it's taken a toll on us.

264
00:13:25.543 --> 00:13:26.675
Yeah. I know.

265
00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:28.764
I don't think you do.

266
00:13:30.374 --> 00:13:32.899
I mean. why don't you let
Bobby take over for a while?

267
00:13:33.029 --> 00:13:35.597
What? No. no no. I think I've
worked way too hard for this
business.

268
00:13:37.381 --> 00:13:39.035
You've done it all. baby.

269
00:13:39.122 --> 00:13:40.515
There's nothing left to prove.

270
00:13:44.345 --> 00:13:45.389
Yeah.

271
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.477
Come on.

272
00:13:59.229 --> 00:14:00.622
And. by the way.

273
00:14:00.752 --> 00:14:02.363
What the fuck was
that the other night?

274
00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:03.320
At the club?

275
00:14:04.321 --> 00:14:05.018
Silas.

276
00:14:06.323 --> 00:14:07.672
He's fine. I got him in the arm.

277
00:14:10.284 --> 00:14:11.676
I thought
your debt was settled?

278
00:14:11.807 --> 00:14:13.591
They are. That's
the good thing about capitalism.

279
00:14:13.678 --> 00:14:15.245
You get new ones.

280
00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.292
What did you do
with the screwdriver?

281
00:14:18.422 --> 00:14:19.946
I threw it in
the park trash can.

282
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:22.862
Nice. - No. not nice.

283
00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:26.735
Your partner brings
me all kinds of new business.

284
00:14:27.997 --> 00:14:29.651
Yeah. he's got a unique style.

285
00:14:31.696 --> 00:14:33.220
You want some Armenian coffee?

286
00:14:33.307 --> 00:14:35.048
No. thanks.

287
00:14:35.178 --> 00:14:36.049
It's the strongest
thing you can drink around here.

288
00:14:46.494 --> 00:14:47.799
So. you're looking to
buy some Humboldt weed?

289
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:49.976
We can sell you 200 pounds.

290
00:14:51.673 --> 00:14:52.804
We don't really do
anything less than that.

291
00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:55.242
Okay. how much?

292
00:15:00.856 --> 00:15:03.076
You're looking at about
a hundred thousand dollars.

293
00:15:05.774 --> 00:15:06.993
I know a lot of
guys up in Humboldt.

294
00:15:08.298 --> 00:15:09.517
Who're you getting it from?

295
00:15:11.301 --> 00:15:12.389
Excuse me?

296
00:15:14.217 --> 00:15:15.262
The 200 pounds
of flowers' a lot.

297
00:15:15.392 --> 00:15:16.741
maybe I know the grower.

298
00:15:18.613 --> 00:15:21.616
It's this
hippie guy by the coast.

299
00:15:21.746 --> 00:15:23.444
A lot of
hippie guys by the coast.

300
00:15:25.663 --> 00:15:27.274
There's no buying any less?

301
00:15:27.404 --> 00:15:29.450
My friend.
this is a good deal.

302
00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.452
We can't sell you this for less.

303
00:15:31.539 --> 00:15:33.062
It'll cost us money.

304
00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:38.459
Yeah. she's
a big chunk of change.

305
00:15:40.548 --> 00:15:41.766
Well. maybe you're in
the wrong business then? Hmm?

306
00:15:43.507 --> 00:15:45.814
Nah. I don't
think that's the case.

307
00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:48.382
What's your background?

308
00:15:48.512 --> 00:15:50.775
Used to be a grower upstate.

309
00:15:50.906 --> 00:15:54.910
Explains your questions.
But what about before that?

310
00:15:55.041 --> 00:15:56.477
I was a dancer.

311
00:16:01.482 --> 00:16:04.441
I used to fight. box.

312
00:16:04.572 --> 00:16:06.966
A boxer? Very cool.

313
00:16:08.097 --> 00:16:08.750
I love the

314
00:16:10.099 --> 00:16:12.754
barbaric nature of the sport.

315
00:16:12.841 --> 00:16:15.409
I hope you didn't get
hit on the head too many times.

316
00:16:15.539 --> 00:16:17.541
because selling
this will make you five

317
00:16:17.672 --> 00:16:19.587
times as much as
what we are charging you.

318
00:16:19.717 --> 00:16:21.241
So why don't
you sell it yourself?

319
00:16:25.114 --> 00:16:26.724
This isn't a negotiation.

320
00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:30.641
And you're
starting to try my patience.

321
00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.037
Vince.

322
00:16:35.168 --> 00:16:37.735
You can't do that man. You can't
talk to them dudes like that.

323
00:16:37.866 --> 00:16:39.172
What? I can't ask questions?

324
00:16:39.259 --> 00:16:40.782
Yeah. you can.

325
00:16:40.912 --> 00:16:42.001
But look. they're
giving us non-compliant

326
00:16:42.131 --> 00:16:44.046
weed that can't get sold. right?

327
00:16:44.438 --> 00:16:45.439
So you got
the regulators on our side.

328
00:16:47.093 --> 00:16:48.355
Fortune favors the bold.

329
00:16:49.356 --> 00:16:49.791
Yeah. it does. But

330
00:16:51.401 --> 00:16:52.968
we don't have
that kind of money.

331
00:16:53.099 --> 00:16:54.796
I can flip
a hundred thousand in a week.

332
00:16:54.926 --> 00:16:55.927
We don't have
it in the business?

333
00:16:56.928 --> 00:16:57.625
No.

334
00:16:59.061 --> 00:16:59.844
Hey.

335
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:02.195
Don't quit your side jobs.

336
00:17:21.997 --> 00:17:23.172
It's all here?

337
00:17:23.259 --> 00:17:24.826
Just bring the bag back.

338
00:17:26.654 --> 00:17:28.264
What? -Don't act like
you don't know. alright?

339
00:17:28.351 --> 00:17:30.353
The bag. The black bag.
no one ever brings them back.

340
00:17:30.484 --> 00:17:32.399
You know how much
I spent a month on those things?

341
00:17:33.704 --> 00:17:34.575
Is this really a thing?

342
00:17:36.229 --> 00:17:38.187
Yeah. it adds up.

343
00:17:41.321 --> 00:17:42.278
So. how's business?

344
00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:44.019
Slowly dying. You?

345
00:17:46.239 --> 00:17:48.937
Less runs. mostly swapping out
a legal flower for regulatory.

346
00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:50.069
Crazy how things change. huh?

347
00:17:51.809 --> 00:17:52.680
Guess it's just
a matter of time. right?

348
00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:54.029
I guess so.

349
00:17:55.683 --> 00:17:56.379
I don't know.

350
00:17:57.946 --> 00:17:59.339
I think I will
go back to growing.

351
00:17:59.469 --> 00:18:00.905
Maybe go back
East on my own indoor.

352
00:18:02.255 --> 00:18:03.038
Tabitha would move there?

353
00:18:03.952 --> 00:18:05.084
No.

354
00:18:05.214 --> 00:18:06.563
I'm thinking. you know.

355
00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:09.000
maybe on my own for a while.

356
00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:11.829
Find someone more
stable. less quincy.

357
00:18:12.265 --> 00:18:13.440
What? Like you?

358
00:18:15.659 --> 00:18:17.226
Go marry that girl. Vince.

359
00:18:17.313 --> 00:18:18.662
If you are thinking of leaving.

360
00:18:18.793 --> 00:18:20.751
I got guys back East
always looking to buy.

361
00:18:20.882 --> 00:18:21.752
Really. - Yep.

362
00:18:23.667 --> 00:18:24.799
Just let me know.
I'll make the contact.

363
00:18:24.929 --> 00:18:26.279
Yeah. that'll be great.

364
00:18:28.846 --> 00:18:30.979
Thanks. - Yeah man.
you got it. Oh. wait a minute.

365
00:18:32.763 --> 00:18:37.290
Look at this. -
I remember this day. Where'd you

366
00:18:37.377 --> 00:18:40.989
find this? - Some old box.
It's the good old days. huh?

367
00:18:41.076 --> 00:18:42.382
Yeah.

368
00:18:42.512 --> 00:18:43.861
Back when
you could kick my ass.

369
00:18:45.167 --> 00:18:46.255
I could still kick your ass.

370
00:19:45.401 --> 00:19:47.534
We're shutting down
the business at the end of
the summer.

371
00:19:47.621 --> 00:19:49.013
I ran the numbers.

372
00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:50.276
You sure you can
flip this hundred grand?

373
00:19:50.406 --> 00:19:52.191
Of course.

374
00:19:52.321 --> 00:19:53.801
I wouldn't have suggested it.

375
00:19:53.888 --> 00:19:55.716
How well do
you know these guys?

376
00:19:55.803 --> 00:19:58.632
Pretty well. Known
them for like a few weeks.

377
00:19:58.762 --> 00:20:00.895
We have some kind
of relationship now.

378
00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:03.680
Yeah. we need this deal.

379
00:20:03.811 --> 00:20:04.638
I know.

380
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:09.120
Look. I want
to talk to your guy.

381
00:20:09.251 --> 00:20:10.644
My guy?

382
00:20:10.774 --> 00:20:12.559
The big guy.
The guy you collect for.

383
00:20:12.689 --> 00:20:14.213
That guy? No. no way.
That's out of the question.

384
00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:15.692
We can't do that. Vince.

385
00:20:15.823 --> 00:20:17.781
Yeah. I don't
see any more options.

386
00:20:17.912 --> 00:20:19.392
Listen. Vince. You don't
want to mess with these dudes.

387
00:20:19.522 --> 00:20:20.697
You saw what they had me
do. What'd I do on the old what?

388
00:20:20.828 --> 00:20:21.655
Two Gs?

389
00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:23.570
What other choice do we have?

390
00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.224
Let the place go broke?

391
00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:27.574
I mean. it ain't
got to be like that.

392
00:20:27.661 --> 00:20:31.708
But it is. Look.
I work my entire life.

393
00:20:31.839 --> 00:20:33.232
I'm in my 40s and
I have nothing to show for it.

394
00:20:33.362 --> 00:20:34.842
I still live in an apartment.

395
00:20:34.972 --> 00:20:36.322
Hey. apartments ain't bad.

396
00:20:36.452 --> 00:20:37.975
Not to you. you're a kid.

397
00:20:38.062 --> 00:20:39.847
Just setup
a meeting with your guy. okay?

398
00:20:56.733 --> 00:21:00.084
This looks awfully suspect.

399
00:21:00.215 --> 00:21:01.738
You said you wanted to
meet. This is the meeting spot.

400
00:21:06.047 --> 00:21:07.962
Fellas.

401
00:21:12.183 --> 00:21:13.663
I never heard
from you the other day.

402
00:21:14.621 --> 00:21:16.318
Uh. my phone died.

403
00:21:16.753 --> 00:21:18.973
I need you to
stay in contact with me.

404
00:21:21.192 --> 00:21:22.106
Understood.

405
00:21:23.543 --> 00:21:25.284
This is uh-

406
00:21:25.414 --> 00:21:29.070
Vince. And you're
here to borrow some money. ya?

407
00:21:30.332 --> 00:21:33.161
Yeah. Maybe we can go
talk about this in private?

408
00:21:34.815 --> 00:21:36.077
You're amongst friends here.

409
00:21:36.207 --> 00:21:37.383
How much are you looking for?

410
00:21:39.733 --> 00:21:40.690
A hundred thousand.

411
00:21:42.344 --> 00:21:43.780
Hundred thousand
dollars is a lot of money.

412
00:21:46.043 --> 00:21:46.827
Yeah. I know.

413
00:21:46.957 --> 00:21:47.567
but we're good for it.

414
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:52.789
But I don't know you.
Him. I unfortunately know.

415
00:21:54.008 --> 00:21:56.619
I'm going to need some sort
of reassurance or collateral.

416
00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:58.317
Just in case
you can't pay me back.

417
00:21:58.447 --> 00:22:00.188
Then we're good for.

418
00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:02.146
How much did
you business make last year?

419
00:22:02.277 --> 00:22:03.626
A quarter of
a million dollars.

420
00:22:03.757 --> 00:22:04.366
And lately?

421
00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:07.804
Slightly less.

422
00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:18.032
I don't like to lose Vince.

423
00:22:22.166 --> 00:22:23.254
We'll get back to you.

424
00:22:29.304 --> 00:22:30.349
Bobby.

425
00:22:34.788 --> 00:22:35.789
Keep your phone on.

426
00:22:57.288 --> 00:22:58.899
What the fuck?

427
00:23:04.034 --> 00:23:04.818
I really
appreciate you giving me time.

428
00:23:04.905 --> 00:23:06.123
No problem.

429
00:23:06.254 --> 00:23:07.429
That's fine. But
you're paying next time.

430
00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:08.387
I sure hope so.

431
00:23:08.517 --> 00:23:09.910
What's going on here?

432
00:23:10.345 --> 00:23:11.868
Oh. hey Ricky
was just telling me by.

433
00:23:11.999 --> 00:23:13.304
What?

434
00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.176
We went to
the showcase tonight for actors.

435
00:23:15.306 --> 00:23:16.656
It was way too far
for me to Uber back. so

436
00:23:16.743 --> 00:23:17.831
he brought me.

437
00:23:19.528 --> 00:23:20.877
I should probably get going.

438
00:23:21.008 --> 00:23:21.530
Yeah. you should.

439
00:23:23.967 --> 00:23:27.188
I'm sorry.
thank you. I appreciate it.

440
00:23:30.365 --> 00:23:33.107
Seriously? You just
embarrass me like that?

441
00:23:33.237 --> 00:23:34.282
What're you talking about?

442
00:23:34.413 --> 00:23:35.588
He's trying to get me work.

443
00:23:35.718 --> 00:23:37.328
It's not what he wants.

444
00:23:37.459 --> 00:23:39.243
If you would look
at your phone like you

445
00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:40.767
do for everyone else.
you would see that I text you.

446
00:23:41.855 --> 00:23:43.857
Vince. I know
you have a lot going on. but

447
00:23:43.987 --> 00:23:45.641
I want to feel
like a priority to you.

448
00:23:45.728 --> 00:23:46.425
You are a prio-

449
00:23:51.908 --> 00:23:53.606
What's going on between us?

450
00:23:53.693 --> 00:23:55.651
Nothing. we're fine.

451
00:23:55.738 --> 00:23:56.609
Are we?

452
00:23:58.262 --> 00:23:58.872
What are you talking about?

453
00:24:01.004 --> 00:24:04.094
I just- Sometimes I just...
I don't know.

454
00:24:04.181 --> 00:24:05.139
I feel like we're
two different people.

455
00:24:05.269 --> 00:24:07.054
Yeah. we are and that's why

456
00:24:07.184 --> 00:24:08.185
this works.

457
00:24:11.188 --> 00:24:12.102
I just feel
like it should be more.

458
00:24:12.189 --> 00:24:14.278
Yeah. I agree.

459
00:24:14.365 --> 00:24:15.497
Maybe we both want things
that we don't have right now.

460
00:24:16.759 --> 00:24:17.717
I'll be upstairs.

461
00:25:02.457 --> 00:25:05.199
Yo. Vince. This is
Bobby. So I talked to the guy.

462
00:25:05.329 --> 00:25:06.722
he said he's in. So it's
your call if you still want

463
00:25:06.853 --> 00:25:09.290
to go through with
this. If so. we meet up with

464
00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:11.510
him tomorrow. Let me know.

465
00:25:56.032 --> 00:26:00.384
The terms are standard.
One week to repay. 15% interest.

466
00:26:00.515 --> 00:26:03.300
If you can't pay
it back. you put up collateral.

467
00:26:03.431 --> 00:26:05.302
What kind of collateral?

468
00:26:06.042 --> 00:26:08.088
Twenty five percent of your
business for the next 10 years.

469
00:26:08.175 --> 00:26:09.350
To recoup the interest.

470
00:26:10.481 --> 00:26:11.874
And I want your license.

471
00:26:12.005 --> 00:26:13.180
My license?

472
00:26:13.963 --> 00:26:16.226
Your delivery license.
I hear it's worth 50.000.

473
00:26:16.357 --> 00:26:19.316
Somewhat like 80. You want
me to transfer my license?

474
00:26:21.667 --> 00:26:23.494
Perhaps you feel like
you've been treated unfairly.

475
00:26:30.458 --> 00:26:31.981
Excuse us for a minute.

476
00:26:48.432 --> 00:26:49.912
What're you thinking?

477
00:26:50.043 --> 00:26:51.044
I don't know
what the fuck to think.

478
00:26:52.262 --> 00:26:53.612
They don't have many choices.

479
00:26:55.526 --> 00:26:56.615
You can walk away.

480
00:26:57.528 --> 00:26:58.965
Fine. go broke?

481
00:26:59.095 --> 00:27:00.706
I lose the business
If I can't pay him back.

482
00:27:00.836 --> 00:27:02.882
I lose if I don't
borrow. Either way. fucked.

483
00:27:05.188 --> 00:27:06.625
You got the guy
that can move this. right?

484
00:27:06.755 --> 00:27:09.366
Yeah. We'll
get it back in a week.

485
00:27:10.019 --> 00:27:11.368
Rest is ours.

486
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.328
What's the problem?

487
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:19.246
Is I see these people
living their lives. you know?

488
00:27:19.333 --> 00:27:23.903
Nice family.
good homes. good jobs. 401ks.

489
00:27:26.079 --> 00:27:26.906
Who want that?

490
00:27:28.777 --> 00:27:29.865
Tide walked around a few.

491
00:27:31.867 --> 00:27:33.739
Fortune favors the bold. right?

492
00:27:35.958 --> 00:27:36.959
Fuck it. Let's do it.

493
00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:38.091
Fuck it.

494
00:28:28.707 --> 00:28:32.188
My friends. welcome. I'm
glad you came to your senses.

495
00:28:34.538 --> 00:28:35.452
Is that my money?

496
00:28:36.192 --> 00:28:37.716
Got our flower?

497
00:28:38.325 --> 00:28:39.456
It's in
the back of that truck.

498
00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:43.896
It smells amazing.
Telly's finest. Check it out.

499
00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:55.342
200 pounds. If we're
a little off on the weight.

500
00:28:55.429 --> 00:28:56.169
you can charge us.

501
00:29:03.263 --> 00:29:03.829
It's all there?

502
00:29:05.744 --> 00:29:08.964
Whoo! It smells
good as fuck back here. man.

503
00:29:09.095 --> 00:29:10.183
It's good stuff.

504
00:29:11.184 --> 00:29:12.098
It's good shit. bitch.

505
00:29:20.671 --> 00:29:23.109
I'll send someone for
the truck. Don't scratch it.

506
00:29:24.893 --> 00:29:26.286
You're not going to count it?

507
00:29:26.416 --> 00:29:27.809
I trust you.

508
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:34.207
Con velez.

509
00:30:01.582 --> 00:30:02.322
We're taking
a right. right here. right?

510
00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:05.194
Alright.

511
00:30:09.808 --> 00:30:10.678
I've been thinking
about what I want to do with

512
00:30:10.809 --> 00:30:11.679
the money after we sell. man.

513
00:30:13.159 --> 00:30:15.596
Yeah? What? You gonna
have a party?

514
00:30:15.726 --> 00:30:18.381
Oh. man. I want to
give it to my sister.

515
00:30:19.339 --> 00:30:20.949
That's kinda new.

516
00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:24.431
Yeah. man. Hey.
just give her an edge. you know?

517
00:30:24.561 --> 00:30:26.346
I mean. we can run this game for

518
00:30:26.476 --> 00:30:30.263
a while. but she needs to
go to college. man. They won't

519
00:30:30.393 --> 00:30:33.440
be much. but it'll
pay for a semester or two.

520
00:30:34.397 --> 00:30:36.704
Someone's tagging
along. Head on. Bobby.

521
00:30:36.791 --> 00:30:39.707
This is the right thing to do.

522
00:30:39.838 --> 00:30:41.100
But I'm still doing our part.

523
00:30:42.188 --> 00:30:43.145
Sure you are.

524
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:09.476
Hey. Franco. Thanks. brother.

525
00:31:09.563 --> 00:31:10.520
No worries. man.

526
00:31:11.739 --> 00:31:13.654
Hey. I got a hot date tonight.
She charges by the hour.

527
00:31:15.003 --> 00:31:15.874
Have fun with that.

528
00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:19.355
Hello.

529
00:31:20.226 --> 00:31:20.922
Alright. we'll see
you early in the morning.

530
00:31:21.009 --> 00:31:23.316
7 AM. 6:30 for you.

531
00:31:35.371 --> 00:31:36.938
Let's get this money.

532
00:31:46.382 --> 00:31:47.035
What's wrong?

533
00:31:57.176 --> 00:31:58.133
What's up?

534
00:32:01.223 --> 00:32:03.399
You see the two
dudes. across the street?

535
00:32:05.401 --> 00:32:06.402
Yeah.

536
00:32:13.932 --> 00:32:16.021
I don't know.
maybe I'm just being neurotic.

537
00:32:16.673 --> 00:32:19.154
Probably just
looking for hookers or

538
00:32:19.285 --> 00:32:20.416
get drugs or some shit.

539
00:32:23.898 --> 00:32:24.594
Sure.

540
00:32:25.552 --> 00:32:26.901
Yeah. it's nothing.

541
00:32:57.801 --> 00:32:59.020
Hey. I'm going to head out.

542
00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:00.500
Okay.

543
00:33:01.718 --> 00:33:02.589
You okay?

544
00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:04.286
Yeah. I'm okay.

545
00:33:05.287 --> 00:33:07.768
Are we okay?

546
00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:11.511
Yeah. yeah. we're okay.

547
00:33:11.946 --> 00:33:14.079
Okay. I'll be out in a second.

548
00:33:31.661 --> 00:33:33.968
Yo. Is Bobby coming?

549
00:33:34.099 --> 00:33:35.100
Yeah. he's supposed to.

550
00:33:36.057 --> 00:33:37.624
Alright. Well. let's go.

551
00:33:50.158 --> 00:33:50.898
What?

552
00:33:57.513 --> 00:33:59.341
What the fuck?
Where's the truck. man?

553
00:33:59.994 --> 00:34:01.996
Is this a joke?
This is a joke. right?

554
00:34:02.127 --> 00:34:04.564
No. it's not a fucking
joke. The gate was open.

555
00:34:04.694 --> 00:34:07.349
The gate was open!

556
00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:08.698
What the fuck. man?!

557
00:34:11.049 --> 00:34:11.701
It's alright. dude.

558
00:34:13.703 --> 00:34:17.403
Calm down. Whatever
happened. I got it on camera.

559
00:34:23.452 --> 00:34:25.063
Maybe one of your guys
forgot to lock the doors.

560
00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:26.020
Not a chance.

561
00:34:26.151 --> 00:34:27.500
How do you know?

562
00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:29.371
Because I'm
the guy who locks it.

563
00:34:30.546 --> 00:34:31.852
Okay.

564
00:34:31.982 --> 00:34:33.288
Wait a second. Right here.

565
00:34:34.681 --> 00:34:35.377
Got it.

566
00:34:38.163 --> 00:34:40.295
Who the fuck is that?

567
00:34:41.253 --> 00:34:43.472
Never seen him before.
He's coming out the back of the

568
00:34:43.603 --> 00:34:45.648
truck. man. It's
not one of your guys?

569
00:34:45.779 --> 00:34:47.520
No.

570
00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:47.998
You didn't check
all the barrels in the

571
00:34:48.129 --> 00:34:49.261
back of the van?

572
00:34:49.609 --> 00:34:50.088
Fuck.

573
00:34:51.393 --> 00:34:54.266
I got to call Bobby. Fuck.

574
00:34:57.443 --> 00:34:58.226
Pick up. pick up. pick up.

575
00:34:59.140 --> 00:34:59.923
Fuck.

576
00:35:01.186 --> 00:35:01.969
Hey man. the weeds' gone.

577
00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:04.667
We're fucked. call me.

578
00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:24.165
Yo. Bobby?

579
00:35:24.992 --> 00:35:25.775
Hello?

580
00:35:25.906 --> 00:35:26.907
Is Bobby home?

581
00:35:27.037 --> 00:35:27.603
Who are you?

582
00:35:28.648 --> 00:35:30.171
No. I have not seen him.

583
00:35:30.258 --> 00:35:30.737
You cannot just
walk in here like this.

584
00:35:30.867 --> 00:35:31.999
Bobby?!

585
00:35:35.176 --> 00:35:36.221
Can I help you something?

586
00:35:36.351 --> 00:35:37.135
No. Bobby!

587
00:35:39.137 --> 00:35:39.876
Jackie. the door!

588
00:35:41.269 --> 00:35:42.314
Oh. - Hey!

589
00:35:42.444 --> 00:35:44.098
Do you know where Bobby is?

590
00:35:44.229 --> 00:35:45.534
No. I don't know.
He left this morning.

591
00:35:45.665 --> 00:35:47.232
Did he say where he's going?

592
00:35:47.362 --> 00:35:48.798
I don't know.
He got a call when he left.

593
00:35:48.929 --> 00:35:49.712
Get the hell out of here!

594
00:35:50.322 --> 00:35:51.410
Fuck!

595
00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:53.063
Did he say you can come over?

596
00:35:53.151 --> 00:35:55.414
You just walk at
people's houses like you own it?

597
00:35:55.544 --> 00:35:57.372
You just going to
keep on walking. huh?

598
00:36:00.549 --> 00:36:01.637
Fucking white boys.

599
00:36:29.317 --> 00:36:31.972
Hey.

600
00:36:32.102 --> 00:36:33.191
Hi. can I help you?

601
00:36:33.843 --> 00:36:35.323
Yeah. I'm looking
for some guys who were

602
00:36:35.454 --> 00:36:36.716
doing business out
of here the other day?

603
00:36:36.846 --> 00:36:38.718
Oh. Um. whoever was here left.

604
00:36:38.848 --> 00:36:40.589
The lease was up yesterday.

605
00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:44.593
Is there somebody else
that has their. did they give

606
00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:46.421
their contact?
Anything I can get?

607
00:36:46.552 --> 00:36:49.424
We're a short-term lease
company. So. I wouldn't know.

608
00:36:49.511 --> 00:36:51.731
What somebody else? Like
maybe there's another manager or

609
00:36:51.861 --> 00:36:52.993
like somebody
else in the office?

610
00:36:53.123 --> 00:36:54.473
Look. I don't know.

611
00:36:54.603 --> 00:36:55.952
I mean. I'm
sure there's somebody.

612
00:36:56.083 --> 00:36:56.910
I'm so sorry.
I can't help you.

613
00:36:56.997 --> 00:36:58.085
Yeah. Okay. listen.

614
00:36:58.216 --> 00:36:59.042
I'm sure there's somebody there.

615
00:36:59.173 --> 00:36:59.695
No. I need you to leave.

616
00:37:00.043 --> 00:37:01.393
Okay. Hey. hey. hey.

617
00:37:02.611 --> 00:37:03.699
What the fuck is wrong? Hey!

618
00:37:26.809 --> 00:37:28.246
How many days you have left?

619
00:37:28.333 --> 00:37:30.465
Six? - Come
on. man. That's crazy!

620
00:37:30.552 --> 00:37:32.032
Borrow it was less.

621
00:37:32.162 --> 00:37:33.599
Where'd you get
that? On his website?

622
00:37:33.686 --> 00:37:35.035
Come on man.
I'm fucked right now.

623
00:37:35.165 --> 00:37:36.863
You're not fucked.
You got to think. man.

624
00:37:36.993 --> 00:37:38.473
Watch the buds.
Watch the buds. man. They

625
00:37:38.604 --> 00:37:41.215
get harvested next
week. Who owes you money?

626
00:37:41.346 --> 00:37:44.218
Bobby collected
whatever little debt was owed.

627
00:37:44.305 --> 00:37:46.176
See that's bullshit. dude.

628
00:37:46.307 --> 00:37:48.440
That's why we need safe
banking. Growers. dispensaries

629
00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:51.834
can't get any kind of bank
accounts. No loans.
it's bullshit.

630
00:37:51.965 --> 00:37:53.445
Fuck. man.

631
00:37:53.575 --> 00:37:54.054
I think I'm
going to go talk to him.

632
00:37:54.184 --> 00:37:54.707
Talk to who?

633
00:37:54.837 --> 00:37:56.361
The guy!

634
00:37:56.491 --> 00:37:57.100
And what? Tell
him you can't pay him?

635
00:37:57.666 --> 00:37:58.972
No. no. If he's
a businessman. he's gonna

636
00:37:59.102 --> 00:38:00.582
want to work something out.

637
00:38:00.713 --> 00:38:02.497
Yeah. break your legs.

638
00:38:14.204 --> 00:38:15.380
Your call has
been forwarded to an

639
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:16.772
automatic voice message system.

640
00:38:16.903 --> 00:38:17.686
Fuck.

641
00:39:19.574 --> 00:39:21.446
Vincent Spinano. welcome.

642
00:39:23.491 --> 00:39:24.144
Where's your partner?

643
00:39:25.319 --> 00:39:25.928
Bobby couldn't make it.

644
00:39:28.757 --> 00:39:29.671
He's a busy guy.
What can I do for you?

645
00:39:31.934 --> 00:39:32.935
We had some
complications. you and I.

646
00:39:34.197 --> 00:39:35.982
The exchange went well.

647
00:39:36.112 --> 00:39:38.114
We just got crossed
and lost the product.

648
00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:39.420
What do
you mean lost the product?

649
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:42.684
It's gone.
There's a guy in the back of

650
00:39:42.771 --> 00:39:44.556
the truck. We get
back to the warehouse.

651
00:39:44.686 --> 00:39:46.514
he got out. drove off with it.

652
00:39:46.645 --> 00:39:48.951
Like a trojan horse.

653
00:39:49.038 --> 00:39:50.388
You think it was the guy
that sold you the flower?

654
00:39:50.475 --> 00:39:51.563
Yeah. it had to be.

655
00:39:52.477 --> 00:39:53.042
Where'd they go?

656
00:39:55.393 --> 00:39:57.220
I don't know. Went by
their place. everyone was gone.

657
00:39:57.351 --> 00:39:58.874
Is Bobby with you?

658
00:39:58.961 --> 00:39:59.701
No.

659
00:40:03.357 --> 00:40:04.793
And you've come here
because you can't pay me back.

660
00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.839
No. we're
going to pay you back.

661
00:40:06.969 --> 00:40:10.843
Well. you have a week. Where's
the five days now? Surely you

662
00:40:10.973 --> 00:40:14.716
can come up with something by
then. Maybe even a bit of story.

663
00:40:16.022 --> 00:40:17.545
We got it on tape.

664
00:40:17.676 --> 00:40:19.025
Should probably go
to the police then. huh?

665
00:40:19.155 --> 00:40:22.637
Look. I came by here
to meet you face to face.

666
00:40:22.768 --> 00:40:25.814
We could work something out.

667
00:40:25.901 --> 00:40:29.252
Maybe renegotiate
the payments or the terms.

668
00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:34.910
I think you have
me confused with a bank.

669
00:40:35.041 --> 00:40:36.129
You know what it's
like if it gets out that

670
00:40:36.259 --> 00:40:37.783
I'm giving away. grace periods

671
00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:40.742
and amending deals?
It makes me look soft.

672
00:40:42.091 --> 00:40:43.266
You know our street critters?

673
00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:44.964
Yeah. of course.

674
00:40:45.355 --> 00:40:46.444
Then stop fucking with me.

675
00:40:49.011 --> 00:40:50.970
How do you know your partner
is not involved in all this?

676
00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:52.580
Nah. Bobby wouldn't do this.

677
00:40:53.233 --> 00:40:54.974
He works with
a lot of people. that guy.

678
00:40:55.104 --> 00:40:58.281
Find the guys. find
your partner. you understand?

679
00:40:58.760 --> 00:40:59.979
You have five days.

680
00:41:02.547 --> 00:41:03.199
Yeah. okay.

681
00:41:04.287 --> 00:41:05.071
Hey. Vincent.

682
00:41:06.899 --> 00:41:07.552
Plan on seeing Bobby?

683
00:41:09.292 --> 00:41:10.337
Yeah. at some point.

684
00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:13.209
I might have a deal for you.

685
00:41:15.647 --> 00:41:16.430
Fuck. fuck!

686
00:41:22.828 --> 00:41:24.699
Pick up. pick up. pick up.

687
00:41:25.874 --> 00:41:26.527
Pick up.

688
00:41:28.007 --> 00:41:29.312
No one is
available to pick up-

689
00:41:42.325 --> 00:41:43.065
What's wrong?

690
00:41:43.979 --> 00:41:44.850
Nothing.

691
00:41:45.415 --> 00:41:47.026
Doesn't look like nothing.

692
00:41:47.156 --> 00:41:47.809
Just work stuff.

693
00:41:48.636 --> 00:41:49.376
Yeah?

694
00:41:50.029 --> 00:41:51.465
Yeah.

695
00:41:52.161 --> 00:41:53.249
Okay. because
I want to show you something

696
00:41:53.336 --> 00:41:55.338
but I don't
want you to get upset.

697
00:41:56.296 --> 00:41:57.036
Okay.

698
00:41:57.471 --> 00:41:58.254
Okay.

699
00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:10.310
So.

700
00:42:11.964 --> 00:42:14.096
I've been
thinking a lot about us

701
00:42:14.183 --> 00:42:16.708
and we're not
getting any younger

702
00:42:16.838 --> 00:42:19.145
and I just
needed some solid ground.

703
00:42:19.275 --> 00:42:21.495
So I took a test the other day.

704
00:42:21.626 --> 00:42:22.540
when you saw me.

705
00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:28.197
I mean. I just
think this is a sign.

706
00:42:29.721 --> 00:42:30.983
Just promise you won't get mad.

707
00:42:31.113 --> 00:42:32.158
Yeah. promise.

708
00:42:34.639 --> 00:42:35.901
Look. after what happened
today everything's downhill.

709
00:42:36.031 --> 00:42:37.772
Okay.

710
00:42:37.903 --> 00:42:39.731
So the test.
it came back a little faint.

711
00:42:39.861 --> 00:42:41.515
So I took another one today.

712
00:42:44.083 --> 00:42:46.389
And before I even
looked at it I just thought.

713
00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:49.001
what is it that I want to see?

714
00:42:49.131 --> 00:42:50.742
I don't know if it's right but

715
00:42:56.530 --> 00:42:57.400
Shit! Shit!

716
00:42:59.968 --> 00:43:00.578
Shit!

717
00:43:11.414 --> 00:43:13.025
Hey! Where
the fuck have you been?

718
00:43:15.201 --> 00:43:15.767
Are you alone?

719
00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:19.771
Yeah.

720
00:43:19.858 --> 00:43:20.815
Fine.

721
00:43:20.946 --> 00:43:21.599
I'll see you there in 10.

722
00:43:41.488 --> 00:43:42.750
Hey.

723
00:43:42.881 --> 00:43:45.231
Where the fuck
have you been. man?

724
00:43:45.318 --> 00:43:46.667
This wasn't
supposed to happen. Alright?

725
00:43:46.798 --> 00:43:47.799
Are you working
with these guys?

726
00:43:47.929 --> 00:43:49.801
Yes. but not on our job.

727
00:43:49.931 --> 00:43:52.586
Alright. they fucked me.
But I swear I didn't know man.

728
00:43:52.717 --> 00:43:54.196
You don't know what the guys
in the back of the truck.

729
00:43:54.327 --> 00:43:56.721
No. They were
rolling over other dealers

730
00:43:56.851 --> 00:43:58.766
but they weren't supposed to
roll us. That was never
the plan.

731
00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.595
I had to make ends meet
Vince. You've been hurting.

732
00:44:01.726 --> 00:44:02.988
Fuck. Bobby.

733
00:44:04.946 --> 00:44:07.035
You know where they are now?

734
00:44:07.166 --> 00:44:08.602
I don't know. man. Armenia.
Paris. Italy. I don't know.

735
00:44:08.733 --> 00:44:10.299
They got their money and
they left. That was their plan.

736
00:44:13.346 --> 00:44:15.609
The girl at your house.
she said you got a call.

737
00:44:15.696 --> 00:44:17.393
Did you know before me?

738
00:44:18.699 --> 00:44:23.225
You went to my house? A buddy
of mine got screwed. too.

739
00:44:24.183 --> 00:44:26.141
He calls me. I have to go see
him. I can't see him and
see you.

740
00:44:26.272 --> 00:44:28.143
So you fucking let
me discover by myself?!

741
00:44:28.274 --> 00:44:29.797
I didn't mean for this shit.

742
00:44:29.928 --> 00:44:31.843
I didn't mean for
this shit to happen. Vince

743
00:44:31.973 --> 00:44:32.713
I swear!

744
00:44:36.717 --> 00:44:39.677
By the way. your other
boss is looking for you. too.

745
00:44:42.941 --> 00:44:44.682
You saw him?

746
00:44:44.812 --> 00:44:45.204
Yeah. I saw him. I couldn't
get in touch with you.

747
00:44:47.336 --> 00:44:50.165
Why would you do
that? What did you tell him?

748
00:44:51.384 --> 00:44:54.692
I told him we got screwed.
Asked to cut us a deal. but

749
00:44:54.779 --> 00:44:57.782
that ain't happening. Instead.
he tells me I deliver you

750
00:44:57.869 --> 00:44:59.131
he'll cut me a deal.

751
00:45:00.567 --> 00:45:01.699
Vince. no.

752
00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:05.703
He wants to kill me. man.

753
00:45:07.052 --> 00:45:08.270
I screwed up. Vince.

754
00:45:11.665 --> 00:45:15.669
Okay. Look.
look. look. look. Hey!

755
00:45:15.756 --> 00:45:17.497
I never fucking found you.

756
00:45:17.627 --> 00:45:20.152
Nobody's here.
Nobody's going to know.

757
00:45:20.282 --> 00:45:22.981
He's gonna know.
He's gonna know. man.

758
00:45:23.111 --> 00:45:24.896
I don't know how
he just has his ways.

759
00:45:25.461 --> 00:45:26.245
Look. he's a crazy motherfucker.

760
00:45:26.375 --> 00:45:27.376
He will kill both of us.

761
00:45:30.292 --> 00:45:32.468
You know. what?
It's not your fault.

762
00:45:34.688 --> 00:45:37.299
I'll go meet him. I'll
talk to him. it'll be fine.

763
00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:41.129
Hey. Look.
we got to stick together.

764
00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:42.348
You're too fucking young. kid.

765
00:45:43.784 --> 00:45:44.872
We stick
together in this. Bobby.

766
00:45:46.047 --> 00:45:46.787
I know.

767
00:45:49.703 --> 00:45:52.662
You've always been
like a brother to me. Vince.

768
00:45:52.793 --> 00:45:53.794
But you got to trust
that I can handle this.

769
00:45:55.927 --> 00:45:57.276
I'll talk to him.

770
00:45:58.538 --> 00:45:59.104
It's gonna be fine.

771
00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:01.584
Bobby.

772
00:46:22.214 --> 00:46:23.302
It's positive.

773
00:46:38.578 --> 00:46:40.275
Sorry.

774
00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:43.409
Yeah. May I grab this?

775
00:46:43.539 --> 00:46:44.497
Okay.

776
00:47:20.576 --> 00:47:21.360
Get in. Vince.

777
00:47:47.299 --> 00:47:48.126
So? how's it going?

778
00:47:50.302 --> 00:47:51.085
It's going.

779
00:47:52.086 --> 00:47:53.740
It's a beautiful day out.

780
00:47:54.523 --> 00:47:58.440
So hey. it's nice out
everyday. Some people that suck.

781
00:47:59.311 --> 00:48:02.096
Oh. that's not very nice.
Vince. Have you seen
Bobby lately?

782
00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:05.795
No.

783
00:48:26.381 --> 00:48:27.687
What are we doing here?

784
00:48:28.296 --> 00:48:29.732
We're gonna
need your cellphone.

785
00:48:30.124 --> 00:48:31.647
Give me the fucking phone.

786
00:48:31.778 --> 00:48:33.171
Why?

787
00:48:33.301 --> 00:48:33.998
How about shut
your yapper and give me

788
00:48:34.085 --> 00:48:35.303
the fucking phone?

789
00:48:47.359 --> 00:48:49.274
I get this feeling I'm going
for a long walk off
a short pier.

790
00:48:51.145 --> 00:48:53.626
I want to show you one
of my new favorite spots.

791
00:49:17.911 --> 00:49:19.957
We had a telling
you the last time we met. Vince.

792
00:49:21.132 --> 00:49:22.437
We're going to pay you.

793
00:49:23.743 --> 00:49:24.874
I know you won't.

794
00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:26.876
Get over there.
Get on your fucking knees.

795
00:49:28.008 --> 00:49:30.054
Go down there.
You heard what the fuck I said.

796
00:49:31.142 --> 00:49:33.405
Come on. guys.
We've got 4 more days. okay?

797
00:49:33.535 --> 00:49:34.754
Don't fucking hurt
him. He's just a kid.

798
00:49:34.884 --> 00:49:36.234
We got some money. okay?

799
00:49:36.364 --> 00:49:37.670
I don't like
being lied to. Vince.

800
00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.411
Just give us
a couple more days

801
00:49:39.541 --> 00:49:40.934
and we will get
you your money. please.

802
00:49:43.458 --> 00:49:44.459
Come on. come on. No!

803
00:49:47.506 --> 00:49:48.986
It's my turn.
hand me the fucking knife.

804
00:49:51.466 --> 00:49:52.163
Fuck!

805
00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:54.600
No. no! Don't do it!

806
00:49:54.948 --> 00:49:55.644
Street cred. Vince.

807
00:50:00.388 --> 00:50:01.607
No!

808
00:50:16.274 --> 00:50:17.188
Put him down and
push him in the water.

809
00:50:19.581 --> 00:50:20.713
Let's go.

810
00:50:21.931 --> 00:50:23.020
You have four days. Vince.

811
00:50:46.565 --> 00:50:48.349
911. what's your emergency?

812
00:50:49.002 --> 00:50:50.177
Yeah.

813
00:52:17.395 --> 00:52:18.352
Pregnancy.

814
00:53:04.616 --> 00:53:05.704
What's wrong?

815
00:53:30.555 --> 00:53:32.209
Glad you called me.

816
00:53:32.339 --> 00:53:34.080
Look. she can stay
with me as long as you need.

817
00:53:34.211 --> 00:53:35.995
Alright. I got the extra bed
in the hangar. it's no problem.

818
00:53:36.125 --> 00:53:37.518
Thanks.

819
00:53:38.389 --> 00:53:39.564
Can't even begin to imagine
what you're going through.

820
00:53:42.436 --> 00:53:43.568
I'm so screwed
I don't know what to do.

821
00:53:44.525 --> 00:53:46.310
You find the money.

822
00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:47.963
Guys like this are
twisted and they're not normal.

823
00:53:48.050 --> 00:53:49.356
They're going to
come after me no matter what.

824
00:53:49.487 --> 00:53:50.705
They want
the money and the license.

825
00:53:50.836 --> 00:53:52.359
You don't know that.

826
00:53:52.490 --> 00:53:55.014
I signed a contract.
I pay them. they kill me.

827
00:53:55.144 --> 00:53:56.145
They have them both.

828
00:53:58.365 --> 00:54:00.149
You haven't been to
something like this before?

829
00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:02.369
Not to this
extent. but something like it.

830
00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:04.241
Whoa. what'd you do?

831
00:54:05.764 --> 00:54:06.678
I hired someone.

832
00:54:06.808 --> 00:54:07.679
Who?

833
00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:08.723
Buddy Houston.

834
00:54:10.377 --> 00:54:12.336
You still got his info?

835
00:54:12.423 --> 00:54:14.512
But you got to contact
someone who contact someone

836
00:54:14.642 --> 00:54:17.428
to contact this guy. Look Vince.
maybe you can find the

837
00:54:17.558 --> 00:54:19.734
money. Just focus on that.

838
00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:21.954
I've been trying.
It's impossible. man.

839
00:54:22.084 --> 00:54:23.303
It's too much money to raise.

840
00:54:25.610 --> 00:54:28.526
This fucking guy.
he doesn't have an army.

841
00:54:28.656 --> 00:54:30.223
He has a few
hired men around him.

842
00:54:30.354 --> 00:54:33.226
That's it. Go in
there and take them all out.

843
00:54:33.357 --> 00:54:35.968
No retaliation.
no trace or nothing.

844
00:54:37.056 --> 00:54:38.536
Ah. fuck. I don't
know what I'm thinking.

845
00:54:38.666 --> 00:54:40.146
You're thinking
ahead. That's good.

846
00:54:40.277 --> 00:54:42.322
I mean. come on.
You know. we're not accountants.

847
00:54:42.453 --> 00:54:44.498
Sometimes we have to do things.
other people don't have to.

848
00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:48.807
Yeah. Thanks.

849
00:54:49.111 --> 00:54:50.025
I always got your back.

850
00:54:50.156 --> 00:54:50.852
Alright.

851
00:54:52.027 --> 00:54:52.550
I'll be back.

852
00:55:01.733 --> 00:55:02.908
Are we safe?

853
00:55:03.778 --> 00:55:06.520
Yeah. they don't
know about Connor.

854
00:55:06.607 --> 00:55:08.217
Or where
he lives. so we're good.

855
00:55:08.305 --> 00:55:10.350
Why can't we just
go to the police then?

856
00:55:10.481 --> 00:55:12.309
We can't. I'm in too deep
and besides these guys. they're

857
00:55:12.439 --> 00:55:14.485
crazy. They'll come
after me and everything I love.

858
00:55:16.574 --> 00:55:17.879
I'm scared. Vince.

859
00:55:18.706 --> 00:55:20.795
I know. I'm sorry
for putting you through this.

860
00:55:22.971 --> 00:55:24.669
This isn't how
we're supposed to live.

861
00:55:36.724 --> 00:55:38.291
I'll fix this. I promise.

862
00:55:38.422 --> 00:55:39.118
You have to.

863
00:57:43.982 --> 00:57:46.463
Yeah. I'd like to withdraw
my money and close my account.

864
00:57:47.028 --> 00:57:47.942
Thank you.

865
00:58:04.655 --> 00:58:07.353
I feel bad. I wish I could
have given you the entire loan.

866
00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:09.181
but my money's
tied up in this place.

867
00:58:11.357 --> 00:58:12.184
It's all good. I just
feel a fucking idiot to be

868
00:58:12.314 --> 00:58:13.402
leaving that fucking truck here.

869
00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:15.666
How much you raised so far?

870
00:58:15.796 --> 00:58:16.536
Not enough.

871
00:58:17.581 --> 00:58:18.364
Not enough.

872
00:58:19.365 --> 00:58:22.281
Well. I want to give you 5k.

873
00:58:22.847 --> 00:58:24.239
No. no. no. Frank. I'm
not here to get money.

874
00:58:24.370 --> 00:58:25.676
I got the money
all ready for you.

875
00:58:25.806 --> 00:58:27.591
I can't take
your money. brother.

876
00:58:27.721 --> 00:58:29.767
Dude. take the money.
We'll figure it out.

877
00:58:32.770 --> 00:58:33.771
Thanks brother.

878
00:58:33.858 --> 00:58:34.511
No worries.

879
00:58:37.949 --> 00:58:39.298
Hey Franco.

880
00:58:40.691 --> 00:58:43.389
Sorry to ask for another
favor. brother.
but I really came

881
00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:44.956
by to see if
I could get one of your guns.

882
00:58:45.913 --> 00:58:48.786
Come on. man.
You don't go mess with no guns.

883
00:58:48.916 --> 00:58:50.222
I don't want
to. but I mean. after

884
00:58:50.352 --> 00:58:52.180
what happened to
Bobby. I just gotta protect

885
00:58:52.267 --> 00:58:53.747
myself. You still got them?

886
00:58:53.878 --> 00:58:55.357
I mean. yeah.
I still got them.

887
00:58:55.488 --> 00:58:57.142
I just can't give you my
guns. they're registered to me.

888
00:58:57.272 --> 00:58:58.752
Something happens. I'm fucked.

889
00:58:59.492 --> 00:59:00.058
Sure someone in
your line of work knows someone

890
00:59:00.188 --> 00:59:01.407
who has one? Maybe go there.

891
00:59:02.451 --> 00:59:04.018
Yeah. yeah. Maybe.

892
00:59:05.890 --> 00:59:07.152
How you doing. baby?

893
00:59:07.282 --> 00:59:09.458
I'd like to be
home but I'm holding up.

894
00:59:09.546 --> 00:59:13.506
I know. I'm sorry.
Look at you doing great.

895
00:59:13.637 --> 00:59:16.161
I've been thinking. I don't
know if your lifestyle is

896
00:59:16.291 --> 00:59:17.423
suited to raising a family.

897
00:59:18.555 --> 00:59:20.252
What do you mean?

898
00:59:20.382 --> 00:59:22.210
Maybe it is. But
just not mine. I'm putting an

899
00:59:22.297 --> 00:59:24.343
option out there. okay?
If you're looking for an out.

900
00:59:24.473 --> 00:59:25.257
I'm giving you one.

901
00:59:25.562 --> 00:59:26.824
You don't mean that.

902
00:59:27.389 --> 00:59:28.956
I just wish you were here.

903
00:59:31.002 --> 00:59:31.655
Me too.

904
00:59:32.699 --> 00:59:34.396
Hey. I'll see you soon.

905
01:00:28.494 --> 01:00:29.277
Hey.

906
01:00:31.236 --> 01:00:31.976
Hey.

907
01:00:33.717 --> 01:00:34.326
Can I help you?

908
01:00:36.502 --> 01:00:37.155
Yes. ah...

909
01:00:38.678 --> 01:00:39.418
Is Ruth around?

910
01:00:40.375 --> 01:00:41.028
Who are you?

911
01:00:43.378 --> 01:00:44.466
Vince.

912
01:00:47.687 --> 01:00:49.036
Yeah. She's out back.

913
01:00:49.341 --> 01:00:50.037
Ah. good.

914
01:00:59.438 --> 01:01:00.178
So. how long
have you been here?

915
01:01:00.308 --> 01:01:02.397
Plus six months.

916
01:01:06.053 --> 01:01:07.533
We don't get many visitors.

917
01:01:10.405 --> 01:01:11.058
Ruth.

918
01:01:11.842 --> 01:01:12.494
[horse neighing

919
01:01:30.121 --> 01:01:31.905
I was wondering
when I'd see you.

920
01:01:33.733 --> 01:01:34.603
It's been a while.

921
01:01:35.604 --> 01:01:36.257
Staying for dinner?

922
01:01:38.433 --> 01:01:40.740
Huh. I don't know. Maybe.

923
01:01:54.798 --> 01:01:56.016
So where you coming in from?

924
01:01:57.278 --> 01:01:58.323
LA.

925
01:01:59.672 --> 01:02:00.325
What's in LA?

926
01:02:02.631 --> 01:02:04.503
Ah. my work and my girlfriend.

927
01:02:06.418 --> 01:02:07.462
Why didn't she come with you?

928
01:02:08.899 --> 01:02:09.334
She's staying with a friend.

929
01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:12.424
Same one from a few years ago?

930
01:02:12.772 --> 01:02:14.556
Yeah. Tabatha.

931
01:02:15.296 --> 01:02:16.384
I liked her.

932
01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:21.302
She was very sweet. You talking
about moving in together?

933
01:02:21.433 --> 01:02:22.173
Yeah. we did.

934
01:02:23.348 --> 01:02:24.088
Oh.

935
01:02:28.962 --> 01:02:30.050
I'm gonna come
back out to the stables.

936
01:02:30.181 --> 01:02:30.834
Okay. honey.

937
01:02:38.058 --> 01:02:41.758
Clara joined us about
six months ago from Minnesota.

938
01:02:42.715 --> 01:02:44.151
There's another
one in the back house.

939
01:02:44.282 --> 01:02:45.413
but he's just passing through.

940
01:02:48.155 --> 01:02:49.896
She's been real helpful.
Getting the barn things cleaned

941
01:02:50.027 --> 01:02:50.941
up around here.

942
01:02:54.466 --> 01:02:55.946
How're the horses. Ma?

943
01:02:56.511 --> 01:02:58.296
Most of them
died from the drought.

944
01:02:59.558 --> 01:03:00.907
Sorry.

945
01:03:01.516 --> 01:03:03.692
It's fine. You didn't know.

946
01:03:04.693 --> 01:03:05.825
I tried calling.

947
01:03:06.739 --> 01:03:07.740
I know.

948
01:03:15.139 --> 01:03:16.531
Something's wrong?

949
01:03:20.013 --> 01:03:21.536
Everything's wrong right now.

950
01:03:21.667 --> 01:03:23.669
I know. I knew
before you said hi.

951
01:03:26.063 --> 01:03:27.499
Is it money you need?

952
01:03:27.586 --> 01:03:31.242
No. Yeah.
but that's not why I came.

953
01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:32.896
Why did you come?

954
01:03:34.201 --> 01:03:35.246
Just gonna grab some stuff.

955
01:03:36.551 --> 01:03:38.815
Stuff? What's. what stuff?

956
01:03:38.945 --> 01:03:40.120
It's just some stuff. Ma.

957
01:03:42.209 --> 01:03:43.602
There you go.
It's the same shit

958
01:03:43.732 --> 01:03:45.386
your father used to pull.

959
01:03:45.473 --> 01:03:47.171
Don't compare me to him.

960
01:03:47.301 --> 01:03:48.737
I don't know what kind of

961
01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:49.738
trouble you're
in. but walk away.

962
01:03:50.391 --> 01:03:52.306
I can't.

963
01:03:52.437 --> 01:03:54.178
This is about
that dope you deal. isn't it?

964
01:03:54.265 --> 01:03:55.875
I know your father
didn't give you kids

965
01:03:56.006 --> 01:03:58.399
any direction and
I blame him for your brother.

966
01:03:58.922 --> 01:04:00.184
Ma. don't bring him up.

967
01:04:00.271 --> 01:04:01.533
It's true!

968
01:04:01.968 --> 01:04:04.797
Don't be like him!
Look how he wound up.

969
01:04:06.277 --> 01:04:08.018
Know when to
say enough is enough.

970
01:04:33.130 --> 01:04:34.174
So nice out here. huh?

971
01:04:34.261 --> 01:04:35.001
Yeah.

972
01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:36.916
You mind?

973
01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:40.137
Where are you going with it?

974
01:04:40.441 --> 01:04:41.355
Inside.

975
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:52.584
Over here's fine.

976
01:04:54.673 --> 01:04:55.630
Huh.

977
01:04:56.066 --> 01:04:58.329
Um. have a seat if you want.

978
01:05:00.853 --> 01:05:02.376
I am gonna go get changed.

979
01:05:15.781 --> 01:05:18.131
Hey. have
you seen a rifle around?

980
01:05:19.350 --> 01:05:21.787
Ah. the Bold action?

981
01:05:24.877 --> 01:05:27.314
Yeah. that's the one.

982
01:05:27.445 --> 01:05:31.318
Yeah. Um. we use
it to kill the coyotes.

983
01:05:31.449 --> 01:05:32.841
You guys still need it?

984
01:05:33.625 --> 01:05:38.369
Ah. no. I can get it for you.

985
01:05:38.499 --> 01:05:39.370
That'd be great. Thanks.

986
01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:48.945
Sorry. It's
so dusty out there.

987
01:06:00.478 --> 01:06:01.218
You smoke?

988
01:06:02.175 --> 01:06:03.046
No.

989
01:06:03.872 --> 01:06:05.526
Did you find
that a little ironic?

990
01:06:05.613 --> 01:06:06.745
My mom told you what I do?

991
01:06:08.573 --> 01:06:09.269
Yep.

992
01:06:14.622 --> 01:06:16.189
I hope you don't mind if I do.

993
01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:17.234
No. that's fine.

994
01:06:26.286 --> 01:06:28.071
You don't know
what you're missing.

995
01:06:32.814 --> 01:06:34.642
Wanna hear some music?

996
01:06:35.034 --> 01:06:36.731
No. I actually. you know what?

997
01:06:36.862 --> 01:06:37.863
That rifle would be great.

998
01:06:39.517 --> 01:06:40.997

How do I look at you?

1008
01:07:36.704 --> 01:07:37.705
You know how.

1009

No one's gonna know.

1010
01:08:11.696 --> 01:08:14.002
Next time. stay longer.

1011
01:08:16.657 --> 01:08:18.181
It's awfully
friendly around here.

Listen. I'm sorry.
I just get a little emotional.

1013
01:08:25.971 --> 01:08:26.711
I love you.

1014
01:08:27.625 --> 01:08:28.800
I love you too. Ma.

1015
01:08:32.934 --> 01:08:33.892
Here you go.

1016
01:08:34.022 --> 01:08:35.763
No. no.

1017
01:08:35.894 --> 01:08:37.113
It's just a couple
of thousand. It'll help you.

1018
01:08:37.243 --> 01:08:38.114
I'm good.

1019
01:08:38.244 --> 01:08:39.202
Just take it.

1020
01:08:39.332 --> 01:08:41.900
Please. I'm okay. Promise.

1021
01:08:42.030 --> 01:08:44.424
I want you to
have some peace. You don't

1022
01:08:44.555 --> 01:08:46.731
always have to
be chasing something.

1023
01:08:46.818 --> 01:08:50.038
You can settle down.
I want some grandkids!

1024
01:08:52.302 --> 01:08:53.216
I love you. Ma.

1025
01:10:02.502 --> 01:10:03.329
Are you okay?

1026
01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:04.548
As best I can be.

1027
01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:09.248
I'm sorry. Is Scott around?

1028
01:10:09.553 --> 01:10:10.771
He's in the hangar.

1029
01:10:10.902 --> 01:10:11.642
Come on.

1030
01:10:13.731 --> 01:10:15.602
Talk to
the guy. He give me tonight.

1031
01:10:17.038 --> 01:10:18.344
Sure you want to do this?

1032
01:10:18.475 --> 01:10:19.563
Absolutely.

1033
01:10:32.706 --> 01:10:34.055
Is that him?

1034
01:10:35.492 --> 01:10:36.362
Yeah. that's him.

1035
01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:55.251
Thanks for coming.

1036
01:10:55.381 --> 01:10:56.034
Sure thing.

1037
01:10:58.210 --> 01:11:00.865
Here's
the pictures and informational.

1038
01:11:02.562 --> 01:11:03.259
Great.

1039
01:11:04.738 --> 01:11:06.566
Any home security
I should know about?

1040
01:11:06.697 --> 01:11:08.089
Guards? Dogs?

1041
01:11:09.439 --> 01:11:12.093
There's only a couple of
guys. One large. tatted up guy.

1042
01:11:12.224 --> 01:11:14.008
I didn't see any dogs.

1043
01:11:14.139 --> 01:11:16.097
I imagine there's cameras
but I can't say for certain.

1044
01:11:16.228 --> 01:11:16.968
That's fine.

1045
01:11:19.231 --> 01:11:23.279
I don't take
Bitcoin. Cash only. 25.000.

1046
01:11:23.409 --> 01:11:25.498
10.000 for anyone
else I have to takeout.

1047
01:11:26.978 --> 01:11:27.935
Yeah.

1048
01:11:28.066 --> 01:11:28.719
That's good.

1049
01:11:29.502 --> 01:11:30.198
Half upfront.

1050
01:11:37.858 --> 01:11:40.034
Good. I'd be in
touch with you guys.

1051
01:11:40.948 --> 01:11:42.733
What if we need to
get in touch with you?

1052
01:11:42.863 --> 01:11:45.649
You know? So how do
we know where you are?

1053
01:11:45.779 --> 01:11:49.000
Only my protégé knows. GPS.

1054
01:11:49.130 --> 01:11:51.307
And I'll call you guys
once the day in check in.

1055
01:11:57.748 --> 01:11:58.357
Wow.

1056
01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:01.012
Fuck.

1057
01:13:36.629 --> 01:13:38.718
Who are you working with?!

1058
01:13:38.849 --> 01:13:40.503
Hard to refresh
some guy. I don't know.

1059
01:13:41.286 --> 01:13:43.462
Give us the name or
this is gonna last all day.

1060
01:13:43.897 --> 01:13:45.159
I don't know.
just fucking some guy.

1061
01:13:45.246 --> 01:13:47.379
Old man.
who are you working with?

1062
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:51.383
Alright. it's
Scott. You know this Carter?

1063
01:13:51.514 --> 01:13:52.732
Who's Carter?

1064
01:13:52.863 --> 01:13:54.342
How do I fucking know?

1065
01:13:54.734 --> 01:13:55.779
That answers your question?

1066
01:13:55.909 --> 01:13:57.433
Let me go! Let me go!

1067
01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:58.346
This is gonna hurt.

1068
01:13:58.738 --> 01:14:00.436
No!

1069
01:14:00.566 --> 01:14:01.306
Better get your ass
moving if you wanna see

1070
01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:03.264
your girlfriend alive. Vince.

1071
01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:27.348
Nice job. Fredo. What the
fuck? You missed a spot. man.

1072
01:15:27.479 --> 01:15:28.959
Cover it up.

1073
01:15:29.089 --> 01:15:30.961
You know how hard
it is to clean that up?

1074
01:15:31.091 --> 01:15:31.744
What the fuck.

1075
01:15:34.747 --> 01:15:35.400
Where the fuck's my girl?

1076
01:15:36.619 --> 01:15:37.750
I'm ready.

1077
01:15:37.837 --> 01:15:39.099
Good.

1078
01:15:39.491 --> 01:15:41.319
You fucking
assholes! Where is she?

1079
01:15:41.406 --> 01:15:44.583
She's fine. The boss want
to have some fun with her first.

1080
01:15:45.671 --> 01:15:49.414
Look. you got what
you wanted. Just let her go.

1081
01:15:49.545 --> 01:15:53.026
You tried to kill our boss.
You tried to steal our money.

1082
01:15:53.157 --> 01:15:57.248
Look at where
you're at. Look around.

1083
01:15:57.944 --> 01:16:00.033
The problem
with the world today.

1084
01:16:00.164 --> 01:16:03.776
is people like you think
you're owned something.

1085
01:16:05.125 --> 01:16:09.173
You're not owning anything.
You're about to choke to death

1086
01:16:09.303 --> 01:16:12.611
on your own blood at
the hands of this artist.

1087
01:16:12.742 --> 01:16:17.355
I'm really sorry you didn't get
to watch his master work with

1088
01:16:17.485 --> 01:16:18.399
your friend. Bobby.

1089
01:16:18.486 --> 01:16:19.662
Fucking assholes!

1090
01:16:24.101 --> 01:16:24.971
It's time to go.

1091
01:16:27.626 --> 01:16:28.584
Hey. look.

1092
01:16:29.541 --> 01:16:33.327
You got what
you want. Just let her go.

1093
01:17:00.354 --> 01:17:01.051
What the fuck?

1094
01:17:03.401 --> 01:17:05.272
Don't fucking move.

1095
01:17:06.578 --> 01:17:07.274
Who the fuck are you?

1096
01:17:09.886 --> 01:17:10.887
Who's that over there?

1097
01:17:11.017 --> 01:17:12.062
Somebody that got in the way.

1098
01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:25.989
Did you hire my father?

1099
01:17:26.076 --> 01:17:27.164
Yeah.

1100
01:17:27.294 --> 01:17:28.644
How much did it cost?

1101
01:17:28.774 --> 01:17:30.428
It's 25 grand. 10.000

1102
01:17:30.558 --> 01:17:31.995
for anyone else
that gets in the way.

1103
01:17:38.262 --> 01:17:40.481
Jesus. How
the hell did you find us?

1104
01:17:40.612 --> 01:17:45.661
He keeps a tracker
in his belt. Doesn't give me

1105
01:17:45.791 --> 01:17:47.488
all the details.
but may I see how is that?

1106
01:17:59.283 --> 01:17:59.718
Fuck.

1107
01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:03.679
What are you doing?

1108
01:18:04.418 --> 01:18:07.117
Checking their phones.
Check the GPS history.

1109
01:18:08.161 --> 01:18:11.599
See if I can find my
girlfriend. God damn it.

1110
01:18:11.730 --> 01:18:13.776
There's
somebody else responsible?

1111
01:18:13.906 --> 01:18:14.994
Yeah. these guys have a boss.

1112
01:18:16.648 --> 01:18:18.258
What about your dad's tracker?

1113
01:18:18.389 --> 01:18:19.912
No. it's just
a tracking device.

1114
01:18:20.043 --> 01:18:21.392
It doesn't have a history.

1115
01:18:21.479 --> 01:18:22.480
Fuck.

1116
01:18:22.610 --> 01:18:23.350
Try the car.

1117
01:18:32.272 --> 01:18:32.882
I'm sorry.

1118
01:18:34.144 --> 01:18:36.450
He knew the game. We all do.

1119
01:18:39.932 --> 01:18:42.021
Hey. Are you gonna kill him?

1120
01:18:43.806 --> 01:18:44.937
I don't know.

1121
01:18:45.242 --> 01:18:47.897
Well. if
you do. consider us even.

1122
01:22:39.606 --> 01:22:40.303
boot thumps]

1123
01:23:04.414 --> 01:23:05.458
Oh. babe.

1124
01:23:05.589 --> 01:23:06.938
Babe.

1125
01:23:10.507 --> 01:23:11.290
Babe!

1126
01:23:24.521 --> 01:23:25.478
Ah!

1127
01:23:37.925 --> 01:23:40.276
Funny enough.
I think today was your deadline.

1128
01:23:43.496 --> 01:23:45.411
Consider our agreement paid..

1129
01:24:02.994 --> 01:24:03.821
Babe!

1130
01:24:55.046 --> 01:24:55.960
Ah.

1131
01:24:56.352 --> 01:24:57.657
Are you okay?

1132
01:24:58.615 --> 01:25:01.661
I made a mistake. Should have
hired you as my hitman?

1133
01:25:07.014 --> 01:25:07.798
I love you.

1134
01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:18.374
Now get me to a hospital.

1135
01:25:18.504 --> 01:25:19.462
Oh.

1136
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:24.902
In the end.
I probably should have just

1137
01:25:25.032 --> 01:25:26.338
gone out of
business. It would have been way

1138
01:25:26.469 --> 01:25:29.689
easier that way.
But it is what it is.

1139
01:25:44.356 --> 01:25:46.489
The business completely changed.

1140
01:25:46.576 --> 01:25:48.578
As legalization picked up.
no longer did

1141
01:25:48.665 --> 01:25:50.623
anyone need the dealer.
nor our deliveries.

1142
01:25:51.537 --> 01:25:54.323
It was now big business.com kids
or White Collar professionals

1143
01:25:54.453 --> 01:25:58.979
running the show. Everyone
wanted in on the action.

1144
01:25:59.066 --> 01:26:01.156
You want a delivery? There's an
app for that. You have a problem

1145
01:26:01.286 --> 01:26:04.768
with the supplier? Call
your lawyer. You want to own a

1146
01:26:04.898 --> 01:26:07.901
part of a cannabis company?
There's an overpriced
stock on Wall

1147
01:26:08.032 --> 01:26:10.904
Street. I was squeezed
out of business I was on the

1148
01:26:10.991 --> 01:26:14.038
forefront of. And even
worse. no one ever known.

1149
01:26:14.169 --> 01:26:15.909
Nor paid me for it.

1150
01:26:15.996 --> 01:26:19.783
But I was never owed
anything. Maybe I should have

1151
01:26:19.913 --> 01:26:24.701
been. When I was breaking
the law. I have a family with

1152
01:26:24.788 --> 01:26:28.574
Tabitha now. and I went back to
doing what I do best. Growing.

1153
01:26:29.445 --> 01:26:32.230
Even better. I was working
in what got deemed an essential

1154
01:26:32.361 --> 01:26:36.930
business. Job security. go
figure. I'm making enough money

1155
01:26:37.061 --> 01:26:40.107
that I paid for Bobby's sister's
college education. I know

1156
01:26:40.238 --> 01:26:42.284
he would have appreciated that.

1157
01:26:43.328 --> 01:26:46.113
Cannabis. flower.
hemp. marijuana. whatever

1158
01:26:46.244 --> 01:26:49.552
you want to call it. it became
the highest revenue-generating

1159
01:26:49.682 --> 01:26:54.165
agricultural crop in California.
And I know how to grow it.

1160
01:26:55.949 --> 01:27:00.563
I went full circle.
And that's my story.
