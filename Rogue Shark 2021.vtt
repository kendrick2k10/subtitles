wound than Justine.

204

But being such a young girl
with such a major bite there

205
00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.720
was every chance that she
was not going to make it.

are quite different than

GAVIN (off-screen): There's
only been six confirmed.

261
00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:29.560
unprovoked bites
by tiger sharks in
Australian waters in

262
00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:34.120
the past 20 years and only
two of those have been fatal.

263
00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:40.760
So. in a country where
there are so many bites.

264
00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.880
the fraction that are
due to tiger sharks is

265
00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.920
actually quite small.

266
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.960
They'll feed on birds.
they feed on turtles.

267
00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.080
they feed on marine mammals.

268
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.400
So. they're not
really specialist feeders.

269
00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:55.520
And so. this plays into the
idea that tiger sharks could

270
00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:59.560
be opportunistically
biting people.

271
00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:02.520
Certainly. the first bite
was of a large animal.

272
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.920
But the intent and the
severity of the bite and

273
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.080
the speed that it must have
occurred is not typically

274
00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.320

ADAM: Something strange is
going on here in this bay.

335
00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:59.000
I mean it's unusual
to get three bites
in such a short time.

336
00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.080
but also in
such a small area.

337
00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.200
We really need to get
to the bottom of it and

338

we need to get to
the bottom of it fast.

354
00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.360
RICHARD: So. there are some
distinct patterns that have

355
00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.640
happened with the
bites in Cid Harbour.

356
00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.440
First is the time of day.

357
00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.480
They were all
in the afternoon.

358
00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.560
The other really interesting
one is that they've all

359
00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:00.560
occurred in an area about
the size of a football field.

360
00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.920
That is really unusual.

361
00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:07.000
The other thing is that the
bites have happened almost

362
00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.800
instantaneously after
the victims have jumped in

363
00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.640
the water and splashed.

364
00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.600
<i>NARRATOR: Like Gavin. Richard</i>
<i>thinks the evidence points</i>

365
00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.840
<i>away from tiger sharks.</i>

366
00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.360
RICHARD (off-screen):
Whatever has done it
has reacted straight away.

367
00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.400
That's not tiger behavior.

368
00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.120
They're a bit cautious in
how they approach things.

369
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:30.360
They tend to be a
bit slower in how they
react to baits and pray.

370
00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:33.040
So. this leads us to think
it's possibly something else.

It's showing the turbid waters
versus the clearer waters.

438
00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.840
And as you can see. most
of the Whitsundays region

439
00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.120
itself is quite turbid.

Including Cid Harbour in here.

You don't get the bluer waters
until you move off shore.

442
00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:42.480
These turbid waters are
probably driven by the

443
00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.600
actual sediments
coming off the land and

444

out of these river systems.

445

Now the interesting thing
about these river systems is

446
00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:52.240
that these are pretty key
habitats for bull sharks.

<i>they can make mistakes.</i>

453

GAVIN (off-screen):
Most shark bites are
cases of mistaken identity.

454

If you live in an environment
where you can't see very well

455
00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:29.040
you have to be very. very
quick and very decisive.

456
00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:33.400
So. they'll bite quickly and
sort of ask questions later.

457
00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:37.640
So. this is
consistent with at least

458
00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.480
the first bite in Cid Harbour.

459
00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:44.520

493
00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:23.240
<i>Could this be</i>

494
00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:24.960
ADAM (off-screen):
It definitely was
a turning point.

495
00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.600
You start putting two
and two together of like.

496
00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:28.000
okay these people
are jumping off a boat

497
00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.640
or falling off
a paddleboard and

498
00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.640
getting bit straight away
and there's reports of lots of

499
00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:33.560
food going in the water.

500
00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.440
Lots of boats.

501
00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.680
RICHARD: If you imagine being
a shark in that situation.

502
00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:40.840
you're cruising around.

503
00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.360
there's food scraps
thrown in the water.

504
00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.960
Smell can drift for long.
long distances as well.

505
00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:47.520
So. they could be following
that up current to its source

506
00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.200
thinking what's
happening here.

507
00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.640
As more scraps go in the
water then they can feel the

508
00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:55.600
commotion of little
bait fish zipping around and

509
00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:57.440
going for a feed and
all that kind of stuff.

510
00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:00.360
So. there's a lot of
stimulus in the water.

511
00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:04.120
When they switch into feeding
mode they're like a bit more

512
00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.240
on edge and they're. you know.

513
00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:06.240
"Oh. okay where is this.

514
00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.360

515
00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:10.200
I'm trying to find the source.

516
00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.120
The visibility is bad.

517
00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:13.720
You can't really see around.

518
00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.920
There's a huge shadow above me
but something's under it and

519
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.680
then splash boom. oh cool.

520
00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.360
I'm going to go for it.

521
00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:28.400
And unfortunately if
it's a person that's
jumped in at that stage.

522
00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:32.560
they will come through
at high speed and bite.

523

<i>NARRATOR: The possibility that</i>
<i>human activity could trigger</i>

524
00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:46.600
<i>the attacks is</i>

ANDREW: The other thing that a
boat does is it provides you

529
00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.440
with a hiding spot. right?

530
00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:05.000
So you have this
big thing of shade that

531
00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.040
hangs over you with structure.

532
00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:11.760
It's kind of like a movable
ambush point for a shark.

533
00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:15.800
And it's
interesting that many of
the shark bite accounts

534
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:18.240

535

been implicated in
bites around the world.

567
00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:55.480
Mostly in association with
spear fishing and fishing.

568
00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:57.840
Sometimes they can
come up to boats and

GAVIN (off-screen): Given
the size of Justine's wounds.

575

I think that we can
discount a lot of the
smaller whaler sharks like

576
00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:24.120
black tip sharks because the
diameter of the bite marks

577
00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:28.840
on the first victim
were just simply too large.

578
00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:32.960
That said. the much smaller
bite on the second victim

579
00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:36.960
could indeed have been.
uh. a bite from one of

these smaller whalers.

581
00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:42.280

Yeah. look. it's pretty
clear from this data that our.

657
00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:08.040
one of our tagged
sharks was not there
at the time of the bite.

658
00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:12.000
(screaming)

659
00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:15.800
<i>NARRATOR: The</i>
<i>identity of the most recent</i>
<i>attacker remains unknown.</i>

660
00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:21.240
<i>But as 18 months’</i>
<i>worth of data is analyzed.</i>

661
00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:23.560
<i>some surprising</i>
<i>patterns emerge.</i>

662
00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:27.360
<i>shedding new light on this</i>
<i>tragic cluster of incidents.</i>

663
00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:31.400
<i>By far the most common</i>
<i>large shark showing up</i>

664
00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.600
<i>in Cid Harbour is the tiger.</i>

665
00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:37.040
ADAM: It's
recorded 18 individuals.

666
00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:40.040
<i>NARRATOR: And their</i>
<i>movement patterns make them</i>

667
00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:42.640
<i>a prime suspect once again.</i>

668
00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.200
ADAM: This is. um. a
shark we called Ingo.

669
00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:48.960
It's a juvenile male. one
of the first ones we tagged.

670
00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.920
Um. you can see it
starts of in Cid Harbour.

671
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.120
moves widely over
the Whitsundays.

672
00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.520
but you see it keeps
on looping back through

673
00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:58.000
Cid Harbour
out again. back again.

674
00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:59.560
coming back. coming back.

675
00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.880
RICHARD: So what we see of
Ingo is actually not unusual.

676
00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:06.000
When you zoom out
wider and look at. uh. a
few of the other tigers.

677
00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.800
we're seeing that
they're doing the same thing

678
00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:11.640
of going out on these
big swims out to these

679
00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:13.360
other potential feeding areas.

680
00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.440
But you see them always
looping back through

681
00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.760
the Cid Harbour area.

682
00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:24.840
So the question is.
why are these tiger sharks

683
00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:28.280
focused on the
Cid Harbour area?

684
00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:34.760
ADAM: We've seen a lot
of shark prey in the bay.

685
00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:36.440
you know. there's stingrays.
there's turtles.

686
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.880
there's lots of other fish
that smaller sharks that

687
00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:39.920
the bigger sharks eat.

688
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.880
So. there's
definitely food in the bay.

689
00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.200
But we're not seeing
anything that you might think.

690
00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.520
"Oh. that's going
to attract a lot of
sharks in. you know."

691
00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.000
That's the thing. there's
nothing unusual about the bay.

692
00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:51.800
The most unusual thing
about the bay probably is that

693
00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:54.640
there's 100 boats in the
peak season mooring there and

694
00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.720
throwing stuff in the water.

695
00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:00.600
<i>NARRATOR: Next.</i>
<i>the team analyzes the</i>
<i>data on bull sharks.</i>

696
00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:03.600
<i>With just seven caught.</i>
<i>they're not as common</i>

697
00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:05.440
<i>in Cid Harbour as expected.</i>

698
00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.040
RICHARD (off-screen):
One of the first
bull sharks we tagged was

699
00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:12.560
as big 3.2 meter male.
that we called Bevin.

700
00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:16.240
So. he was tagged in July and
he has swum over 1.500 miles

701
00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:19.400
to the very tip
of Queensland and

702
00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.120
back in a three-month period.

703
00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:25.040
I mean that's a
substantial swim.

704
00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:28.080
ADAM (off-screen): We tagged
seven. seven bull sharks and

705
00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:30.600
most of them showed
really large-scale movements

706
00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.320
up and down the coast.

707
00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.680
They returned
to Cid Harbour but

708
00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:36.400
for very short periods.
passing through.

709
00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:39.560
You probably sort of want to
dismiss them based on that.

710
00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:42.680
But we had one shark. it
was the last shark we tagged.

711
00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:46.240
Uh. that animal
actually didn't make any
large-scale movements.

712
00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:48.440
It hung around the
Whitsundays area in general.

713
00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:52.120
It spent about 50% of
its time moving through or

714
00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:54.720
staying in Cid Harbour.

715
00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.160
Out of the biggest
sharks we've tagged.

716
00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:57.520
this is the only
one that's really shown

717
00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:59.400
some sort of
short-term residency.

718
00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:02.320
So. we'd be silly to
actually rule him out as

719
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:05.920
possibly being responsible
for at least one of the bites.

720
00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:09.480
<i>NARRATOR: Along</i>
<i>with tigers and bulls.</i>

721
00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:13.640
<i>only one other</i>
<i>group of sharks could be</i>
<i>involved in the attacks.</i>

722
00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:15.560
ADAM: The only other shark
that actually spent quite a

723
00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:18.600
bit of time in Cid Harbour
itself was a. was a...

724
00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:20.080
one of the
spot-tails we tagged.

725
00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.960
And they spend about 50%
of its time in Cid Harbour.

726
00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:24.400
but it's not getting
picked up on any of
these other locations

727
00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:26.280
we had receivers
around the Whitsundays.

728
00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:29.880
So. it looks like it spent
a lot of time in the bay.

729
00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:32.960
<i>NARRATOR: With such a small</i>
<i>number of sharks in the study.</i>

730
00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:37.440
<i>exactly who was</i>
<i>responsible for the</i>
<i>attacks may never be known.</i>

731
00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:41.520
<i>But with tigers. bulls and</i>
<i>small whalers all spending</i>

732
00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:46.160
<i>time at the attack site.</i>
<i>none can be ruled out.</i>

733
00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.840
GAVIN (off-screen): Every time
we see a cluster of bites.

734
00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:58.720
in the same area of the world
over a short period of time.

735
00:40:58.800 --> 00:40:59.800
everybody jumps
to conclusions and

736
00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:02.600
it's one individual
that's responsible.

737
00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:05.880
Every time we drill
down and looked into it.

738
00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:10.200
we can't find any scientific
evidence to support that.

739
00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:14.520
Instead. we find increasing
evidence that it's likely to

740
00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:15.960
be different individuals.

741
00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:18.400
sometimes even
different species.

742
00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:22.760
I think something similar
is going on in Cid Harbour.

743
00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:27.720
The medical examination
suggested that the first bite

744
00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:30.120
was by a very
large animal and

745
00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:32.720
the second bite was
much. much smaller.

746
00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:38.720
So. clearly we're not
looking at one rogue shark.

747
00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:44.080
Something in Cid Harbour is
causing different sharks to

748
00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.080
act in this peculiar way.

749
00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.520
ADAM (off-screen): You
know it's not the be all
and end all what did it.

750
00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.160
It's like well. why?

751
00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.600
So. I think that's the
more interesting question.

752
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.120
Is it the perfect storm?

753
00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:58.680
Because Cid Harbour's
got a lot of natural pray.

754
00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:00.920
so it makes sense that sharks
are moved through there.

755
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.280
It's got very bad visibility.

756
00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:05.200
There's people in
there like dumping scraps.

757
00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:08.840
attracting sharks for fun.
you know. there's fishing. uh.

758
00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.680
cleaning their catch
so they can eat it.

759
00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:13.200
Then you've got other people
that are swimming. snorkeling.

760
00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:16.680
paddle boarding. jumping
off boats and splashing.

761
00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:17.720
ANDREW (off-screen):
Sharks are smart.

762
00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.480
They will learn.

763
00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:23.320
So. when something falls.
splash into the water.

764
00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:24.920
they're going to strike at it.

765
00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:33.440
ADAM: I think the
interesting thing is that
it's not just Cid Harbour.

766
00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.120
this is happening
in other places.

767
00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.840
There's other bays up and
down the Great Barrier Reef.

768
00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:39.240
and probably around the world.

769
00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:42.200
that humans are doing
very similar behavior and

770
00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:44.320
some of these places
are probably just

771
00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.800
next in line to have some
sort of shark incident if

772
00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:49.160
they keep on going
the way they're going.

773
00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:51.920
RICHARD: It's important that
we learn from this experience.

774
00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:53.400
and we are.

775
00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:55.520
You know. there's a
lot of changes happening.

776
00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:56.720
ANDREW: If you're on a boat.

777
00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:58.480
don't throw your
stuff overboard.

778
00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:00.520
don't throw
your waste overboard.

779
00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:02.600
don't fish where
people are swimming.

780
00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:05.000
They're just not
compatible activities.

781
00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:07.400
It's not worth the risk.

782
00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:09.600
RICHARD: You know. what we're
talking about is common sense.

783
00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:13.960
So it's just having people
think and become shark smart.
