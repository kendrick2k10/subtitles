00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.480
Now. I want to see love.

3
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.160
passion. happy.

5
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.720
You're just married.

6
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.920
The fighting doesn't start
before the honeymoon.

7
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.280
so smile.

8
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.720
Those pants are way too low.

9
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.080
I like it.

10
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.080
Head up. Shoulders back.

11
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.640
Chest out. Throw your chest out!

12
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.960
Coffee!

13
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.040
And Sumi...

14
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.480
It's Sunny.

15
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.840
It's supposed to be.

16
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.560
You can go.

17
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.720
I'm here to actually...

18
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.320
I know. and I don't need you.

19
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.720
Tell your editor

20
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.960
they'll get the pictures
when they're ready.

21
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.800
If they're late. that's because of you.

22
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.920
Run for your life.

23
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.480
Coffee.

24
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.440
Amanda! Here.

25
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.880
Oh. Amanda.

26
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.400
I need a fresh cup of coffee.

27
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.640
Pronto. Fast!

28
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.040
Are we done?

29
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.600
Oh. okay. Well...

30
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.280
Excellent work today.

31
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.360
"Excellent?"

32
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.920
Try "barely adequate".

33
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.080
Coffee.

34
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.960
And...

35
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.120
they'd better not have skimped
on the sugar.

36
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.920
No. there's five in there.

37
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.640
-Just how you like it. Ms. Bitterly.
-Good.

38
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.440
And tell Better Ways & Weddings

39
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.800
if they expect me to shoot
another cover for their magazine.

40
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.240
they are not to send that horrid assistant

41
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.920
to their assistant editor ever again.

42
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.200
Okay.

43
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.200
Good.

44
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.640
When you started working for me. what.

45
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.040
three to five years ago.

46
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.920
would you ever have imagined
you would go from a lowly intern.

47
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.680
fetching coffee and getting people's mail.
to being my personal assistant?

48
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.400
You're on the ladder. my dear.

49
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.520
On the ladder.

50
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.320
Which way you go now is up to you.

51
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.880
My mail.

52
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.120
My mail. I said.

53
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.960
Tell me if there's anything important.

54
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.960
This is from a Thomas at Christies.

55
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.120
I don't do donations. Next.

56
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.600
This is from Marigold.

57
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.480
Wow. that's a check.
I'll take that. Thank you.

58
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.280
This is from...

59
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.600
Pantria? Pantrea?

60
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.000
King Buckley?

61
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.040
I don't know him. Tell me more.

62
00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.280
It says. "Dear Ms. Beatrice Bitterly.

63
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.280
"you are cordially invited
to my kingdom of Pantrea

64
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.120
"as a guest of the Royal Family.

65
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.880
"to partake in and document
our Five Days of Christmas Celebration.

66
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.360
"This world-renowned event commences
on December 21st.

67
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.760
"All travel and expenses will be covered.

68
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.400
"I hope you can attend.

69
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.760
"Sincerely. King Buckley."

70
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.760
There's a royal stamp
and an RSVP email address.

71
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:21.720
Not interested.

72
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.800
Throw it away.

73
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.000
I'll see you here
in 2 weeks after Christmas.

74
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.200
And...

75
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.240
I'm not to be disturbed until I return.

76
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.480
Okay.

77
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.320
Have fun at your beach house.
Ms. Bitterly.

78
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.320
You'll bet I'll have.

79
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.520
Happy holidays.

80
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.360
You know. cocoa's better
if you drink it. not sleep in it.

81
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.320
You should add peppermint.
and maybe sugar.

82
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.440
No. it's my dad's recipe.
And I'm not a sugar fiend.

83
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.800
Wow. I am so tired.

84
00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.480
Well. that's what you get
when you're a minion

85
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.040
for the queen of the underworld.

86
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.960
I swear. your boss is a love-child

87
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.520
of the Grinch
and the Wicked Witch of the West.

88
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.280
If so. she'd be greener.

89
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.680
-Ever seen her without makeup?
-Oh. stop.

90
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.560
I feel like if I'm patient with her.

91
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.280
then I will get my shot.

92
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.640
Mandy.

93
00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.040
you are a great photographer.

94
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.400
But no one'll know
unless you do something.

95
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.120
Stand up to her.

96
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.880
Like. now's the time.

97
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.960
The writing's on the wall.

98
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.240
On the wall...

99
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.960
Which wall? I have a headache

100
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.280
You need an Aspirin.

101
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.360
I do.

102
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.200
You know what that wall reminds me of?

103
00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:56.960
That wall.

104
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.320
What's with beastly Bitterly's mail?

105
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.400
Oh. I forgot to throw it out.

106
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.240
And what about this all-expenses paid trip

107
00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.920
to the kingdom of Pantrea?

108
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.440
Bitterly doesn't want to go.

109
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.600
This is just what you need.

110
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.480
No. I need my bed.

111
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.800
And a trip out of town.

112
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.280
You know you can cover this event.

113
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.160
Yeah. I can do it. But I'm not invited.

114
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.400
Go to sleep.

115
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.480
We can soon change that.

116
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.840
"Dear King Buckley.

117
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.600
"I would be honored
to attend your festival."

118
00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.720
What is it?

119
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.560
-Is something the matter. Richard?
-Yes.

120
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.800
Why do I keep getting older.

121
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.400
while you keep looking younger?

122
00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.760
Perhaps it's your failing eyesight.
my dear.

123
00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.200
Or that you're incapable
of accepting compliments.

124
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.560
Yes?

125
00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.960
It is I. Stanley Bishop.
your Chief of Protocol.

126
00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.320
Come in. Stanley. We know who you are.

127
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.160
My King.

128
00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.400
-I come...
-Good evening. Stanley.

129
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.520
My Queen.

130
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.640
I come bearing good news.

131
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.080
Beatrice Bitterly accepted your invitation

132
00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.640
and is coming to Pantrea.

133
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.560
Excellent news. indeed.

134
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.840
I want you personally attending
to all her needs.

135
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.400
and you may pick her up

136
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.760
in the new royal vehicle.

137
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.160
The new car?

138
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.640
Won't she find it a bit...

139
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.160
you know...

140
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.880
We must use it for something.

141
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.240
We don't want Catherine's father
thinking we don't appreciate his gift.

142
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.200
Besides. would you ride in it?

143
00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.480
-Certainly not.
-Neither do I.

144
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.320
So. it's settled.

145
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.560
Of course. Sire.

146
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.280
One more thing. Sire.

147
00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.400
It appears Ms. Bitterly
will be travelling incognito.

148
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.520
under the name of Amanda Eastman.

149
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.440
as to avoid the paparazzi.

150
00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.480
Thank you. that will be all.

151
00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.120
Sire. Madam.

152
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.400
A photographer plagued
by fellow photographers?

153
00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.440
At least we don't have that problem.

154
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.480
She must know what she's doing.

155
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.840
There are barely any photos of her online.

156
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.120
A woman of mystery.

157
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.480
Okay. So...

158
00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.520
It's Friday. Wake me up on Sunday.

159
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.520
No time.

160
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.440
Beatrice changed her mind
about the Pantrea trip.

161
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.720
-What? She's going?
-No. you're going.

162
00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.480
She wants to keep her ties
with the Pantreans.

163
00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.280
so she assigned you the job.

164
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.080
You're going to cover the event.

165
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.520
Are you kidding?

166
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.680
This is my shot!

167
00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.960
So. let's get you packed!

168
00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.240
Hi.

169
00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.160
Hello.

170
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.320
And you are?

171
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.320
-Amanda. Amanda Eastman.
-How lovely.

172
00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.320
I'm expecting a Ms. Beatrice...

173
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.920
I hope you will forgive me.

174
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.400
I completely forgot.

175
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.120
But I assure you.
your secret is safe with me.

176
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:53.960
What secret?

177
00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.160
What secret. indeed.

178
00:08:58.760 --> 00:08:59.760
May I?

179
00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.360
Yes. thank you.

180
00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.320
Right this way. Madam.

181
00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.320
It's cold.

182
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.160
Yes.

183
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:18.600
Madam.

184
00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.000
So. what? You're. like...

185
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.800
the King's personal driver?

186
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:27.840
No. Madam.

187
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.680
I am the Chief of Protocol.
Stanley Bishop. at your service.

188
00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.880
Oh. okay.

189
00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.320
It's really beautiful here.

190
00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.120
We like to call it home.

191
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.560
I think I'm a little underdressed.

192
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.080
I'm sure you will do just fine. Madam.

193
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.640
Please.

194
00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.720
I am pleased to announce
Ms. Amanda Eastman has arrived.

195
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.560
May I present
King Buckley and Queen Gloriana.

196
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.080
Your Highnesses.

197
00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.720
We are honored
to have you in our presence.

198
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.640
I know you are a busy woman.

199
00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:30.960
Oh. not really.

200
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.080
Please. call me Amanda.

201
00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.880
If you wish. But I can assure you.

202
00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.920
there are no paparazzi spies in Pantrea.

203
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.600
Great.

204
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.760
Coffee? We've had some made for you.

205
00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.440
Yes. I would love some. Thank you.

206
00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.160
That is...

207
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.440
really strong.

208
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.600
Extremely sweet.

209
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:08.560
Five sugars.

210
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.880
just as you like it.

211
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.320
I read up on you. Ms. Bitterly.
and on your reputation.

212
00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.720
Oh. no. I'm not...

213
00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.680
Mother. Father. about this...

214
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.480
dance...

215
00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.680
Who are you?

216
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.120
Someone special. Sire.

217
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.160
Leopold. this is Beatrice Bitterly.

218
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.400
World-class photographer from America.

219
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.320
She will document the holiday festivities

220
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.000
to share with the world.

221
00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:46.040
Your father believes her pictures
will boost Pantrea's tourist trade.

222
00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.440
So you could say our kingdom's future

223
00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.640
relies on your talented hands and eyes.

224
00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.880
Then I suppose it's only fitting

225
00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.560
that I meet you on my knees.

226
00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.520
Hi.

227
00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.880
Amanda. our son.

228
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.240
Prince Leopold.

229
00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.400
Who is not usually this clumsy.

230
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.400
Leo?

231
00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:12.720
What is all this?

232
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.920
Catherine. this is Beatrice Bitterly.

233
00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.520
world-renowned photographer from America.

234
00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.000
Wait. is it Beatrice or Amanda?

235
00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.600
That is the question.

236
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.520
And this is Duchess Catherine of Carthia.

237
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:43.640
Charmed.

238
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.960
I rode in your dowry.

239
00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:48.920
Very cool.

240
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.680
Thank you.

241
00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.800
Leo. I figured it out.

242
00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.240
We'll rig the raffle.
so you only have to dance with me.

243
00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.480
We shall do no such thing.

244
00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.560
I forbid any dishonesty in my kingdom.

245
00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:04.200
If I catch anyone
doing anything underhand.

246
00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.280
off with their head.

247
00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.640
He just likes to say that.

248
00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.040
It's a king thing.

249
00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.560
Actually. it's a queen thing.

250
00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.160
I feel sick.

251
00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.560
You must be exhausted.

252
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.520
Stanley.
please show Ms. Bitterly to her room

253
00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.440
to freshen up
before dinner and the festivities.

254
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.040
-I'm staying here?
-Of course.

255
00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.560
You are our guest.

256
00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:32.800
Okay.

257
00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.040
Thank you.

258
00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:39.960
Ta-ta.

259
00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.240
"Ta-ta?"

260
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.800
Intriguing woman.

261
00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.760
Savages.

262
00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.920
Will Madam be needing anything else?

263
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:03.840
No.

264
00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.640
The only thing missing
is a hang-glider for a quick escape.

265
00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.880
The kingdom does have a small helicopter.

266
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.320
should you wish to take some aerial shots.

267
00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.960
I will bear that in mind.

268
00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.480
Very well.
I shall call you when dinner is ready.

269
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.080
Stanley!

270
00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.520
My secretary RSVP'd
for me when I confirmed the trip.

271
00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.880
What did the email say?

272
00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.440
Just curious.

273
00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.520
It stated you were honored to be invited

274
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:35.280
and would be travelling incognito
under the name Amanda Eastman.

275
00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.920
I. Beatrice Bitterly. would be attending

276
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.160
as Amanda Eastman?

277
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.520
That is correct.

278
00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.280
Thanks. Stanley.

279
00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:47.920
Madam.

280
00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.600
Sunny. you little bitch.

281
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.880
Do you know what time it is here?

282
00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.760
Yeah. time for me
to come over there and kill you.

283
00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.680
You told them that I was Beatrice!

284
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.520
I told them to call you Amanda.

285
00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.120
As a fake name.

286
00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.680
They think I'm her.

287
00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.720
Posing as yourself.

288
00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.000
So...

289
00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.800
I'm supposed to pretend to be her.
pretending to be me?

290
00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.120
It's way too early for this.

291
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.160
It's too late.

292
00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.960
you mean.
The royal family needs Beatrice...

293
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.480
needs me to save the kingdom.

294
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.400
If they find out.
they'll chop off my head.

295
00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:46.760
And when they do. I'm going to haunt you
for the rest of your life.

296
00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.720
Calm down.

297
00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.320
You're just as good as Beastly Bitterly.

298
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.560
You just need to believe in yourself.

299
00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.320
But I'm not myself.

300
00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.920
I'm herself.

301
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.240
Look. Beastly's a photographer.
you're a photographer.

302
00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:04.840
She's a woman. so are you.
The only difference is reputation.

303
00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.800
Unfortunately. in this world.
you can't get

304
00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.640
a reputation without having a reputation.

305
00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.920
Are you even speaking English?

306
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.760
It's time to show them what you can do.

307
00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.000
As her!

308
00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.400
Eventually. the truth will come out.

309
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.280
And when it does. I'm dead.

310
00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.360
Just be yourself. You know what I mean.

311
00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.560
I've got to sleep. I love you.

312
00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:31.480
I'm sorry.

313
00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:32.800
Speak soon.

314
00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.880
I can't do this.

315
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.720
I am Beatrice Bitterly.

316
00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.800
world-renowned photographer.

317
00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:46.960
I'm talented.

318
00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.800
I'm creative.

319
00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.520
I'm mean.

320
00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.080
I can't do this.

321
00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.840
I know your father loves
the holiday celebrations.

322
00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:04.440
but we really must start preparing
for our marriage as well.

323
00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.960
Like choosing a date. to begin with?

324
00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.840
Yes. and we should do just that.

325
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.840
But after the holidays.

326
00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.440
It's important
for our kingdoms' alliances.

327
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.520
Ever since I was younger.
I dreamt of being...

328
00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.760
A princess.

329
00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.120
Princesses are a dime a dozen.

330
00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.880
Queen was always the goal.

331
00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:25.960
Ruler of the land.

332
00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.360
Which happens by marrying Prince Charming.

333
00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.520
Soon-to-be King Charming. Exactly.

334
00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.160
But just think. once we're married.

335
00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:39.520
I won't have to trek
from my castle to yours every day.

336
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.760
I guess that's why
they call it settling down.

337
00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.040
I think you're right.

338
00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.000
I've never thought of it that way.

339
00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.800
Good evening. Catherine.

340
00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.040
My King.

341
00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.280
No need for that. We're all family here.

342
00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.000
Thank you.

343
00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.760
Well. I am famished.

344
00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:58.920
Do not fear.

345
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.960
you are far from
withering away to nothing.

346
00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.400
Has Stanley summoned...

347
00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.440
Ms. Bitterly.

348
00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.160
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

349
00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.960
-I trust your room is suitable?
-Yes. it is.

350
00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.320
You know. I must apologize again

351
00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.080
about what happened earlier.

352
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.600
Oh no. it's fine.

353
00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.840
May I say. you look lovely.

354
00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.360
Oh. I know.

355
00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:21.760
I mean. thank you.

356
00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.360
So I hear you're a woman of many names.

357
00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.920
What shall we call you?

358
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.160
Amanda is fine.

359
00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.720
Let's stick with that.
it's easier for everyone.

360
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.040
Especially me.

361
00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.000
Do you use that pseudonym often?

362
00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.520
All my life.
So is this where we're eating?

363
00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:38.440
Indeed.

364
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.040
-Let's sit.
-I'm hungry.

365
00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.200
Why not skip the coffee next time

366
00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:01.960
and serve me a cup of sugar?

367
00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.600
That can be arranged. Madam.

368
00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.760
And to think I used to prefer tea.

369
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.120
So. there are seven events
leading up to Christmas.

370
00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.920
Baking. decorations.

371
00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.960
and gift-wrapping?

372
00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:18.960
Yes.

373
00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:22.560
All funds collected are for
the Children of Pantrea Foundation.

374
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.560
providing toys for the holidays.

375
00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.240
-That sounds like a great cause.
-It is.

376
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.920
I love the little toddlers.

377
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.240
I can't wait to have some of my own.

378
00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.440
Princes and princesses everywhere.

379
00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.240
Just like us way back when. Remember. Leo?

380
00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.160
You used to braid my hair.

381
00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.240
Only after you pulled mine.

382
00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:44.600
Our union was written in the stars.

383
00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.400
Call it fate or destiny...

384
00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.920
Call it "an arranged marriage."

385
00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.080
Nothing wrong with that.

386
00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.000
Don't you agree. Beat...

387
00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:54.920
I mean. Amanda?

388
00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.560
Sure.

389
00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.120
I think romance is overrated anyway.

390
00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.760
Not for everyone. For some. obviously.
it works. Just. I'm...

391
00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.160
more career-focused.

392
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.720
An admirable attitude. my dear.

393
00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.920
-Thanks.
-But tell us more. Tell us...

394
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.080
something that is not online.

395
00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.040
There's hardly anything about me online.

396
00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.920
So modest. Ms. Bitterly.

397
00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.200
Well. you know how it is.

398
00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.000
Journalists often just exaggerate.

399
00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.800
Sometimes they make things up entirely.

400
00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:32.720
So.

401
00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.600
who is the real you?

402
00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.640
I've asked myself that question
a lot lately.

403
00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:43.200
Speaking of. it is getting late.
The townsfolk must be gathered outside.

404
00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.680
Catherine is right.

405
00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.640
Let us adjourn to the garden.

406
00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.200
Madam. To keep you warm.

407
00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:01.360
Extra-strong.

408
00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:02.720
Awesome.

409
00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:06.080
You know what?
I won't be able to take photos

410
00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.680
and drink at the same time.

411
00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:08.720
I'll hold it.

412
00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:15.480
So. what's the deal
between the Duchess and the Prince?

413
00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:16.960
The real deal?

414
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.640
I told you. They're to be married.

415
00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:23.440
The royal family set it in motion
when they were still very young.

416
00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.320
so as to unite both kingdoms.

417
00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.160
But have they set a date yet?

418
00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.520
Not as of yet. Madam.

419
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.480
And what about you and the Duchess?

420
00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.400
Why. nothing. Madam. I just...

421
00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.600
Admire from afar?

422
00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.600
-Serve the royal family.
-Gotcha.

423
00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:40.880
Right.

424
00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.040
Dear citizens of Pantrea.

425
00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.760
I am delighted to announce
the commencement

426
00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.280
of the Five Days of Christmas Celebration.

427
00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.800
Now. this year will be very special.

428
00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.640
Not only do these events
sponsor a good cause.

429
00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:06.000
but we have a welcomed guest from America

430
00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.120
documenting our festivities
and traditions.

431
00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.120
Now please.
do not be shy around her camera.

432
00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:16.960
I want the world to see

433
00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.800
what Pantrea has to offer.

434
00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:22.440
The gift-wrapping competition
is in 20 minutes in the library.

435
00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.520
So. all those competing: sign up.

436
00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:29.440
make your donations. see Henry.
in charge of our donations box.

437
00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.680
and may the best wrapper win.

438
00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.600
Amanda.

439
00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.000
come take pictures of us by the lights.

440
00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.320
She's not here to photograph us.

441
00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.120
Oh. one or two won't hurt.

442
00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.800
I want a world-famous photographer
to shoot us.

443
00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.680
We could hire her for our wedding.

444
00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:54.160
Take my left side.

445
00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.160
-It's my better angle.
-Okay.

446
00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.360
Okay.

447
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.360
I need you to stop moving.

448
00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.520
just so I can focus.

449
00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.600
Okay. stop moving.

450
00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.440
We're not moving.

451
00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.040
It's cold. right?

452
00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.640
It'll be better on a tripod anyway.

453
00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.920
The contest is about to begin inside.

454
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.360
So Catherine. Leo. Amanda. shall we?

455
00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.840
Inside. where it's warm.

456
00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.280
I don't see what's so interesting
about wrapping presents.

457
00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:38.840
Nor do I.

458
00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.720
I find you are
a much more interesting subject. Madam.

459
00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:44.720
Thank you. Stanley.

460
00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:58.520
So. you all have 3 minutes

461
00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.880
to wrap your gifts as best you can.

462
00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.040
On your marks.

463
00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.520
get set. go!

464
00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.560
Do you have enough wrapping paper?

465
00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.520
Yeah.

466
00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.680
Careful of the end. there.

467
00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.240
It's sticking out a bit.

468
00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:35.280
Okay. I'm going to go and...

469
00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.440
-Hello.
-Hi.

470
00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.520
I'm going to give you a hand here.

471
00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.360
If we work really hard...

472
00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.480
Oh no.

473
00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:48.840
Good luck. boys.

474
00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.520
You have 2 minutes.

475
00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.040
How do we put this on?

476
00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:56.400
Alright. another piece. Now put that here.

477
00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.040
-A little here.
-Yeah. another there.

478
00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.080
Hey. is it cheating?

479
00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.440
Well. it's our Christmas secret.

480
00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.240
More paper.

481
00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.560
-Okay.
-Oh no!

482
00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.600
-Are you ready?
-No.

483
00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.000
-I'm not done.
-Three...

484
00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.480
-two...
-Quick!

485
00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:19.440
one...

486
00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.480
Stop wrapping!

487
00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:24.720
Well.

488
00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:28.440
I declare contestant number two
to be the winner.

489
00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.600
Congratulations.

490
00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.240
All of these gifts are yours.

491
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:51.880
Hey!

492
00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.520
Those pictures you sent me
are really good.

493
00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.240
-Really? You really think so?
-No doubt about it.

494
00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:59.560
Tell me:

495
00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.560
who is the hunk?

496
00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.640
I assume you're referring
to Prince Leopold?

497
00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.760
He's a prince? Nice.

498
00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:09.880
And he's engaged.

499
00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.600
-To whom?
-To a Duchess.

500
00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.520
Not that I care or anything. because...

501
00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.720
I'm just here to work. Do my job.

502
00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.520
Well. Bitterly's job.

503
00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.760
That's right. Keep your eye

504
00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.240
on the prize and don't get distracted.

505
00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.520
I'm not.

506
00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.400
Good. You know.

507
00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.120
single. handsome princes come and go

508
00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.560
every day.

509
00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.320
Exactly. What do I care he's engaged?

510
00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:36.200
You already said that.

511
00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.040
Right. So let's drop it.

512
00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.840
Dropped. Now. what's up next?

513
00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.840
The Christmas Baking Competition.

514
00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.400
Best dessert wins.

515
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.480
Hey. you could do
your dad's chocolate recipe.

516
00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.200
Maybe add a little bit of sugar.

517
00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.200
Do not talk to me about sugar.

518
00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:55.000
You should see what they do
to the coffee here.

519
00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.360
And no. I won't be competing.
because I am here to shoot.

520
00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:01.320
You're a woman of many talents. Mandy.

521
00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.200
Don't forget it.

522
00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:06.280
Yeah. and currently of many identities.
thanks to you.

523
00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:09.920
Just go with the flow. You'll be fine.
I love you.

524
00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.240
What flow?

525
00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.120
There is no flow.

526
00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.320
All right.

527
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.840
Good match. Sven.

528
00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.200
That's enough for today. Next!

529
00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.400
Sorry.

530
00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.200
I think I distracted you.

531
00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.800
Yes. You certainly are a distraction.

532
00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.800
But these are just friendly matches.
And I won the first 14.

533
00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.560
So. what brings you here?

534
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.240
Your dad said you'd be here.

535
00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.080
Everybody's baking.
so I thought I'd come check you out.

536
00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.160
I did not mean that like that.

537
00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:12.760
I meant. check out the gym. check out

538
00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:14.440
the space. the location.

539
00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.040
It's big.

540
00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.000
And anyway.

541
00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.320
everybody is making desserts

542
00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:24.160
and there is nothing much to take
photographs of until they're done.

543
00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.520
Oh. yes. I think even

544
00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:29.800
Catherine is making
her famous gingerbread cookies.

545
00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:31.600
Do you bake?

546
00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.120
A little bit.

547
00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:36.200
My dad was actually
the chef of the family.

548
00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.960
He cooked his way through college.

549
00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.200
Oh. so your mother's the photographer?

550
00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.320
No. she teaches first grade.

551
00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:45.640
I don't know
why I got into photography. I guess...

552
00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.000
I don't know. to see the world
through different eyes.

553
00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.600
The definition of a true artist.

554
00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.160
-Thank you.
-Leo!

555
00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.520
Oh. dear. Are you alright?

556
00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:05.720
I think I became dizzy
slaving over the hot stove all morning.

557
00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.080
I baked cookies. Gingerbread.

558
00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.760
They sound delicious.

559
00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.840
-I don't suppose you cook?
-Well. on occasion.

560
00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:16.240
Well you should join
the baking competition.

561
00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.960
But I do warn you.
my cookies are hard to beat.

562
00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.080
I've got to take pictures.

563
00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:25.720
Yes. but not until after the guests
arrive with their desserts.

564
00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.400
You have time.

565
00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.760
And my permission.

566
00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:34.000
And to be willing
to get your hands dirty. like me.

567
00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.440
Okay. Lead me to the kitchen.

568
00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.280
Leopold.

569
00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.120
what are you doing?

570
00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:54.000
I was just going to help Amanda.

571
00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:58.360
Kitchen work is not the duty of princes.

572
00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:00.120
Amanda's father was a famous chef.

573
00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.680
Oh. I never said that.

574
00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.080
Be that as it may.

575
00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.640
Amanda's father
will never be king of Pantrea.

576
00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.680
It's okay. I've got this.

577
00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.280
My dad would make a terrible king.

578
00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.680
He loves mowing his own lawn.

579
00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.560
Shouldn't you be photographing
this event. my dear?

580
00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:20.640
Yes.

581
00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:23.680
On it.

582
00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:30.360
Welcome. one and all.
to the second day of our competition.

583
00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:34.640
The best holiday sweet maker will win
a stocking full of goodies

584
00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.400
to hang over the fireplace.

585
00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.080
So. let the judging begin.

586
00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:42.320
I can be the official taster. Sire.

587
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.320
No. Stanley.

588
00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.320
This is definitely a job for the King.

589
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.480
Ah. gingerbread. My favorite.

590
00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:52.600
I know.

591
00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.440
Very...

592
00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.440
very nice. Catherine.

593
00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.480
A little crunchy. perhaps.

594
00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:10.160
Crunchy? That's ridiculous.

595
00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.280
Fruity.

596
00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:22.720
My. my.

597
00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.800
Yes. a little dry maybe.

598
00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.240
I did try to warn him.

599
00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:50.680
Nice.

600
00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:53.560
Oh. look at this.

601
00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.440
What an awful lot of effort.

602
00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.360
Very good. Very good. indeed.

603
00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.000
A for effort. I would say.

604
00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:01.680
Congratulations.

605
00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.240
Now. what have we here?

606
00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.720
Be careful. It's really hot.

607
00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:20.200
What an unusual flavor.

608
00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:23.040
Sweet and...

609
00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.240
amazing.

610
00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:25.920
Yes. it's...

611
00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:30.160
That is absolutely delicious.

612
00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:33.280
I declare Amanda Eastman's hot cocoa
the winner.

613
00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:34.840
Well done.

614
00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:38.120
Bravo. Please. please. Come try.

615
00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.120
Come try.

616
00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:40.840
More cups. please.

617
00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.240
Well done. Here we are.

618
00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.200
Yes. please.

619
00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.320
One for you. Would you like to try that?

620
00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:54.400
Stanley.

621
00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.240
Yes. my Duchess?

622
00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.960
Can I ask you a favor?

623
00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.400
Anything. any time.

624
00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.320
Ah. here we are.

625
00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:02.640
Now...

626
00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.840
Keep your eyes on that girl.
I do not trust her.

627
00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:07.720
Would you like a taste?

628
00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.000
Beatrice Bitterly?

629
00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.560
I thought her name was Amanda?

630
00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.200
Yes. but she travels incognito.

631
00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.120
Interesting.

632
00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:23.120
Now. remember.

633
00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:26.760
All those competing in the next event.
Build the Best Snowman.

634
00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:29.080
change into your snow gear

635
00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.640
and meet up at Pantrea's Peak in one hour

636
00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:35.160
where I. your King.
will be joining the competing teams.

637
00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.480
Which you promised not to do.

638
00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:40.840
I promised no such thing.

639
00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.000
It's not right for the King

640
00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:46.400
-to take part in this.
-Nonsense.

641
00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:50.000
A king should always stay connected
to his community.

642
00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.800
I would not take photographs

643
00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:55.200
of this particular moment.

644
00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:56.680
Oh. right. Yeah.

645
00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:00.080
Even a king and queen
have marital spats now and then.

646
00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.200
Unfortunately. over the last few years.

647
00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:04.480
it's become far more "now" than "then".

648
00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:07.640
You should see my parents go at it.
It's totally normal.

649
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.800
Love always wins out in the end.

650
00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.360
I hope so.

651
00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:13.680
Besides.

652
00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:17.880
I don't consider your obsession
with this movie. Frozen.

653
00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.760
to be a healthy one.

654
00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:21.800
Let it go. Glory.

655
00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:23.280
Let it go.

656
00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:27.560
Darling.

657
00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:30.880
can I speak with you a moment?
I'm not feeling so well.

658
00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:32.640
What is it. Catherine?

659
00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:34.360
Just this.

660
00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:37.800
What?

661
00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:39.840
What was that for?

662
00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.880
I wanted to show you how much I love you

663
00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:44.320
and how much of a perfect couple we make.

664
00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.720
These public displays of affection
are not proper

665
00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:52.920
for the royal family.

666
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.240
Yes. mother.

667
00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.800
But aren't public displays of disagreement

668
00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:59.400
between a king and queen
also frowned upon?

669
00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:04.640
Catherine. might I have a moment?

670
00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.120
Certainly. my Queen.

671
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.920
You love my son. do you not?

672
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.400
Oh. I do. my Queen.

673
00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:13.560
And he. in turn. loves you?

674
00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:14.840
He'd be a fool not to.

675
00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.960
I mean. yes. I'm sure that he does.
He tells me so often.

676
00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:21.720
Then why has a wedding date
not been announced?

677
00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.760
Because the Prince is a very busy man.

678
00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:27.560
He's not that busy.

679
00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:29.400
I'm working on it.

680
00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:31.640
Work harder.

681
00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.320
This marriage is important
for both our kingdoms.

682
00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.800
Yes. I'm all for it. Ready and willing.

683
00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:39.680
Chomping at the bit.
as they say in the royal stables.

684
00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:41.440
You know. to the horses.

685
00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.960
I trust you do not chomp. my dear.

686
00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.760
Just ride. occasionally.

687
00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.600
in a very regal manner.

688
00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.760
I've actually taken lots of pictures.

689
00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.320
Some great ones of your dad.

690
00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:13.400
No need to apologize.
This is why you're here.

691
00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.800
Yes. This is why I'm here:
to take pictures.

692
00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:20.920
And not get distracted.

693
00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:22.680
What was that?

694
00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:24.440
I was just saying.

695
00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:27.200
it's distracting how beautiful it is.

696
00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.240
It's perfect.

697
00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.080
You know.

698
00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:37.120
in the summertime. they call this spot

699
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.760
Lovers' Paradise.

700
00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:43.560
Right.

701
00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:46.160
I really know how to pick them.

702
00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:47.880
-You have a good eye.
-So do you.

703
00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:50.840
Two in fact. Great cheekbones.
nice nose and cute lips.

704
00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:55.480
Thank you.

705
00:36:58.520 --> 00:36:59.840
-Amanda.
-Yes?

706
00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:03.280
I was wondering
if I could ask you a favor.

707
00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.400
Oh boy. Here it comes.

708
00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:07.360
Excuse me?

709
00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.080
I know where this is going.

710
00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:13.280
I'm not sure I'm following you.

711
00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:20.240
You're getting married to Catherine.
the Duchess of Canterbury.

712
00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.400
-Carthia.
-Close enough.

713
00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.560
Right... So?

714
00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:25.640
What does...

715
00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:28.040
Catherine have to do with any of this?

716
00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.520
I was just going to ask

717
00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:34.760
if you'd be so kind as
to not take any pictures

718
00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:36.400
of tomorrow night's event.

719
00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:37.920
At least.

720
00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.560
avoid photographing me.

721
00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:44.720
Why? What's tomorrow night?

722
00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.200
The raffle.

723
00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:48.480
The...

724
00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:52.120
winner gets a dance with the Prince.

725
00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.280
Me.

726
00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.720
Oh. because you can't dance?

727
00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.360
I don't dance in public

728
00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:02.000
with everyone watching me.

729
00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.720
I freeze up.

730
00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:06.600
I've been freezing since I got here.

731
00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:09.920
Dancing is easy.
Just move your arms and shake your body.

732
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.160
It's not like you've got to do a waltz.

733
00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.200
Well. I mean...

734
00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:16.480
it is a...

735
00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:19.200
royal ball. Amanda.

736
00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:22.040
It will be a waltz.

737
00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:28.200
Then I can't help you.

738
00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:32.960
I'm afraid I'll make a fool of myself
in front of the entire kingdom.

739
00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.160
Have you ever seen The King and I?

740
00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:42.200
The King and you? Doing what?

741
00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:45.480
No. it was a play and then a movie.
Never mind.

742
00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.720
The thing about dancing is. you just

743
00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:50.000
have to focus on the other person. so...

744
00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:51.400
hold eye contact.

745
00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:55.840
It's just all about you and her.

746
00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:58.480
Eye contact. you say?

747
00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.840
And now. just focus on me.

748
00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:06.360
It's a lot like fencing. except you have
to get closer to your opponent

749
00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.440
and you try not to stab them
with your sword.

750
00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:18.680
Let's forget that analogy.

751
00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:23.720
So you hum a waltz.

752
00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:25.880
and take the lead.

753
00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:31.520
Eye contact.

754
00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:47.040
Prince Leopold!

755
00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:49.040
Are you quite all right. Sire?

756
00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:52.120
Madam! Is anyone hurt?

757
00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:54.840
We're fine.
Amanda was just giving me some pointers.

758
00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:56.800
My Prince.

759
00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:59.640
you are needed to judge the best snowman.

760
00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:03.920
The King isn't able to
since he is in the competition himself.

761
00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.160
Duty calls.

762
00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:09.680
Sire. you are. of course.
free to choose any snowman you like.

763
00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.960
Any one at all. that goes without saying.

764
00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:15.640
But may I remind you.
the King is the lord of the land

765
00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:19.200
and as it also happens. your father.

766
00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:21.920
But I don't want to appear
to be picking favorites.

767
00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.520
Picking a favorite...
that would be too obvious.

768
00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:32.480
Shall we. Sire?

769
00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:33.960
Yeah. go on. Let's.

770
00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:34.960
Madam?

771
00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:38.200
Yeah. You go. Stanley.

772
00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.960
"Stab her with your sword?"

773
00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:47.480
God!

774
00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:57.760
I'm not in love. It's an infatuation.

775
00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:58.920
He's a prince.

776
00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.520
He's a man. Amanda.

777
00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.640
Like. you danced with him

778
00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:05.360
in the snow.

779
00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.480
They were dancing in the snow?

780
00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:10.920
Yes. But to be fair. Prince Leopold said

781
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.040
she was giving him pointers for the ball.

782
00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:14.440
I bet she was.

783
00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:17.920
From now on. if anyone
is giving Leo pointers. it'll be me.

784
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.560
Besides. I've got better pointers
than she does.

785
00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:21.920
Bigger ones. too.

786
00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:24.520
I'm a Duchess. She's an American.

787
00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:25.920
There's no contest.

788
00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:29.440
Well. I couldn't agree more. Madam.

789
00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:32.160
I do not understand
what is upsetting you so.

790
00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:35.400
Beatrice is a very nice
and talented young woman.

791
00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.680
Have you seen her photographs?
They are beautiful.

792
00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:42.840
It's not right for our son
to be gallivanting around with the help.

793
00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.240
She is a guest. Glory.

794
00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:48.160
What she is. is a distraction.

795
00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:51.480
I heard the two of them were alone
in the gymnasium earlier.

796
00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.120
I sent her to take photos.
What's wrong with that?

797
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.600
It's not how things are done.

798
00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:59.080
Nor was the way we first met.

799
00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:00.560
Have you forgotten?

800
00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:02.560
This isn't about us.

801
00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:05.400
It's about the future alliances
of Pantrea. our son.

802
00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:07.440
and that... girl.

803
00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.400
I don't even know if he's into me.

804
00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:13.560
Well. why don't you find out?

805
00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:17.200
It's not my place. He's engaged.
I told you.

806
00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.440
Third time. now.

807
00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:21.240
What's that supposed to mean?

808
00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:23.400
It means he's still single.

809
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.320
Men have been known to change their minds.

810
00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:29.160
And I'm sure princes have. too.

811
00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:31.120
I am not having this conversation.

812
00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:33.440
You are a bad influence.

813
00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.680
Sometimes it's good to be bad.

814
00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:37.800
You're ridiculous.

815
00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:42.760
I'm very confident that Leo loves me
and wants what's best for the kingdom.

816
00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:45.600
There's not a doubt in my mind.
Not one single doubt.

817
00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:47.000
But tomorrow.

818
00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:50.800
Leo will not be dancing
with anyone else but me.

819
00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:54.640
Madam. the King has made it clear

820
00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:56.800
there's to be
no tampering with the raffle.

821
00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.200
But there won't be any tampering.

822
00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:02.720
Just find out what time
the tickets go on sale and let me know.

823
00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:06.240
You can do that. Stanley. can't you?

824
00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:13.680
Being the Chief of Protocol does give me
access to certain privy information.

825
00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:14.960
I know.

826
00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.280
And I know I can trust you
to be very discrete.

827
00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:21.920
I'm sure our son will do

828
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.640
the right thing. just as his father did
many years ago.

829
00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:27.440
-That's what worries me.
-Really?

830
00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.000
You have regrets?

831
00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:30.800
Of course not.

832
00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:33.440
Don't confuse the issue.

833
00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:36.240
I just want what's best for the kingdom.

834
00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:37.520
So do I.

835
00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:39.720
And for Leo to be happy.

836
00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:43.120
I'm sure Catherine will see to that.

837
00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:46.880
And the alliance of these two families
is what the kingdom needs.

838
00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.000
Now.

839
00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:50.600
it's getting late.

840
00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:52.800
Big day. tomorrow.

841
00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.840
Okay. okay. You do what's right

842
00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:01.680
and live happily ever after...

843
00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:02.800
by yourself.

844
00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:04.560
Good night. Sunny.

845
00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:07.480
But seriously. those pictures you sent
are incredible.

846
00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:11.000
Especially the one with the kingdom.
like. from the hillside.

847
00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:15.480
If it's okay with you.
I want to submit it to my editor.

848
00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:17.480
Like. it's cover-worthy.

849
00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:19.080
Really?

850
00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:24.760
Wait. whose name are you going to use?

851
00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:26.200
Why. yours. of course.

852
00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:28.440
Beatrice Bitterly!

853
00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:29.920
It's Amanda.

854
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.920
Amanda! Amanda. Sunny.

855
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.080
I've got to go.

856
00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:49.280
Oh. hello you.

857
00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:52.000
I mean. my Prince... the Prince.

858
00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:56.000
-Mr. Prince?
-Please. call me Leopold.

859
00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:58.040
Actually.

860
00:44:58.120 --> 00:44:59.560
I prefer Leo.

861
00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:01.600
So do I.

862
00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.920
Right. Well. I just wanted

863
00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:10.280
to thank you again

864
00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:12.240
for the lesson this afternoon.

865
00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.000
It was very helpful.

866
00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:15.560
You're welcome.

867
00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:17.080
Any time.

868
00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:20.040
Oh. I wanted to...

869
00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:23.360
to give you this.

870
00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:26.440
A raffle ticket?

871
00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:28.000
For the ball tomorrow night.

872
00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:30.440
It's the least I could do.

873
00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:36.120
-I'm honored.
-It's just one.

874
00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:38.240
Like I said.

875
00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:39.560
I don't play favorites.

876
00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:43.280
No.

877
00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:45.760
because that wouldn't be proper.

878
00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.800
And "proper" is very important

879
00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:51.680
to many in this household.

880
00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:54.560
Especially my mother.
as I'm sure you've overheard.

881
00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:57.320
Yes. well. that's all moms.

882
00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:59.920
-It's not just a queen thing.
-Yes. but...

883
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.560
in America they surely don't tell you
who you'll spend your life with.

884
00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:06.120
I can see the advantages
of an arranged marriage.

885
00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:09.600
It takes all the pressure off of you
having to make a decision. right?

886
00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:14.120
That is entirely not true.

887
00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:18.200
Well. at least you get
to avoid the dating scene.

888
00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:20.400
I mean. in America. it's a mess.

889
00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:22.920
The games. the constant mixed-messages.

890
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000
"Is he interested in me? Is he not?

891
00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:27.040
"Should it be a kiss or handshake?"

892
00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:29.400
Nobody knows what to do
so they stand around.

893
00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:31.520
awkwardly staring at each other. trying...

894
00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:33.920
to decide.

895
00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:39.520
Well...

896
00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:41.960
Good night.

897
00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:45.080
Good night.

898
00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:05.480
Good morning. You're here early.

899
00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:07.760
I came straight from my castle
this morning.

900
00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:09.360
How many tickets are available?

901
00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:12.320
I believe at the moment.
we have them all: 349.

902
00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.520
Great. I'll purchase them all.

903
00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:21.760
Thank you.

904
00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:25.040
The children will appreciate
your donation and this kind gesture.

905
00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:30.120
Oh yes. of course. The children.

906
00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:34.560
I guess I gotta go home.

907
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.040
Come in.

908
00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:50.680
It's open!

909
00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:20.640
Smile. Leo.

910
00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:24.280
You might at least pretend
to be happy to be here.

911
00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:45.400
That's much better.

912
00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:53.320
Breathtaking.

913
00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:57.360
Yeah. it is. actually.
I can't breathe at all.

914
00:48:58.440 --> 00:48:59.880
I'm really glad you came.

915
00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:01.840
Really?

916
00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:10.760
Hi.

917
00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:13.880
Catherine is here.

918
00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:15.760
Leopold.

919
00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:17.320
your fiancée has arrived.

920
00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:20.560
Oh. I should greet her. Excuse me.

921
00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:25.200
Catherine.

922
00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:27.080
you look

923
00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:29.280
quite striking.

924
00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:31.160
Oh. I just threw this on.

925
00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:33.600
I hope you're in the mood for dancing.
I am.

926
00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:36.360
Good evening. one and all. and welcome.

927
00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:38.960
Thank you for coming to the palace
this evening

928
00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:41.520
to celebrate our fourth Christmas event.

929
00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:43.280
And for contributing

930
00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:45.640
so generously to the Children's Fund.

931
00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:48.920
I'm told we've raised
a tidy sum this year.

932
00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:56.920
And that brings us on

933
00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.760
to tonight's raffle.

934
00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:02.560
The winning ticket will get to dance
with the future king:

935
00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.440
our son. Prince Leopold.

936
00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:13.880
And now. our Chief of Protocol. Stanley.

937
00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.800
will announce the winner.

938
00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:27.080
The winner is two hundred and...

939
00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:28.040
That's me!

940
00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:32.520
-Two hundred and five.
-Yeah. that's also me.

941
00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:36.000
It... It's me.

942
00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:41.440
Will the winner
please step forward for confirmation?

943
00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:47.040
It seems we have a winner!

944
00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:48.800
Congratulations. Madam.

945
00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:53.040
And now Ms. Amanda Eastman will join
Prince Leopold on the dance floor.

946
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:56.960
Thank you.

947
00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:05.080
I swear. I did not rig this.

948
00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:06.760
-I believe you.
-You do?

949
00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:08.960
No. But I don't mind.

950
00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:18.880
Look in my eyes.

951
00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:20.360
I am.

952
00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:31.280
May I please have your attention?

953
00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:34.320
Ladies and Gentlemen.
her Majesty. Queen Gloriana.

954
00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:37.160
Well.

955
00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:39.800
that was simply lovely.

956
00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:43.720
And now I have a very special
announcement to make:

957
00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:45.840
our son. Prince Leopold.

958
00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:48.520
will be before you again
on January the 5th.

959
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:53.840
when he takes Duchess Catherine
of Carthia's hand in holy matrimony.

960
00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:07.400
I didn't know you'd set a date.

961
00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:09.040
Neither did I.

962
00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:23.880
How was it. dancing with the prince?

963
00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:25.400
It was a dream.

964
00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:31.480
Just a dream.

965
00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:40.080
Two minutes left.

966
00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:42.440
Then the best Christmas card
will be awarded.

967
00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:48.120
Amanda. you have to believe me.

968
00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:51.000
I had no idea
Mother would announce a date last night.

969
00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:52.240
We'd not agreed upon it.

970
00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:53.960
It's fine. I'm not mad at you.

971
00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:55.320
Well.

972
00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:57.200
you seem pretty mad.

973
00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:00.960
-Do I? I'm not. I'm mad at myself.
-Why? You did nothing wrong.

974
00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:04.480
I don't understand.

975
00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:06.840
Well. it's probably better that way.

976
00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:11.120
One minute remains.
Please finish your cards.

977
00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:18.600
I really wish you'd just talk to me.

978
00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:19.760
Leopold!

979
00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:22.080
I'm feeling a bit faint.

980
00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:26.840
Would you like to lie down?

981
00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:29.480
No.

982
00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:31.800
I think I feel better
now that you're near.

983
00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:36.320
We should discuss the arrangements.
It's less than 2 weeks away.

984
00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:37.760
And.

985
00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:41.240
you shouldn't keep fraternizing

986
00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:43.600
with the help. It's beneath you. darling.

987
00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:45.520
And one must keep up appearances.

988
00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:48.200
You know you sound just like my mother.

989
00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:51.040
I take that as a compliment.

990
00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:52.920
It's not.

991
00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:58.240
And the time is up.

992
00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:00.280
Good. Let us see

993
00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:02.440
what Christmas magic has been created.

994
00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:12.320
"I think that I shall never see

995
00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:15.120
"a card as lovely as a Christmas tree!"

996
00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:17.240
Nice.

997
00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:31.120
I bet little-miss-perfect
is not so perfect.

998
00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:57.680
Dude! I've been trying
to reach you for days.

999
00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:01.960
Hello? Where are you?

1000
00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:05.280
Are you still mad at me? Is that it?

1001
00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:09.480
Well then.
I've got some great news for you.

1002
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:14.040
I showed your photographs to my editor
and he loved them.

1003
00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:15.440
He's going to use them.

1004
00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:19.320
And guess who he's giving
full photograph credit to?

1005
00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:21.920
Amanda Eastman! That's you. girl.

1006
00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:23.760
The real you.

1007
00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:28.840
What do you think about that?

1008
00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:31.520
Thank you.

1009
00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:34.440
What?

1010
00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:44.120
Hi. I'm looking for a number
in the United States.

1011
00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:46.440
in the State of California.

1012
00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:50.320
The name is Beatrice Bitterly.

1013
00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:57.160
And the best card goes to...

1014
00:56:57.800 --> 00:56:58.640
Billy Wilkins.

1015
00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:01.120
Congratulations. Billy. Well done.

1016
00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:05.520
Isn't that good?
Really. well done. indeed.

1017
00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:10.200
I really think we need to talk.

1018
00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:13.480
I don't think there's anything
to talk about.

1019
00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:19.080
Last night was wonderful.

1020
00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:21.120
It really was.

1021
00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:25.400
But we need to get back to the real world.

1022
00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:29.120
I have a job to do
and you have a duchess to marry.

1023
00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:34.360
Let's not complicate things.

1024
00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:37.960
But feelings matter. Amanda.

1025
00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:39.040
Don't they?

1026
00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:44.240
I can't do this.

1027
00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:52.600
I just need to change my camera card.
I'll be back.

1028
00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:18.720
Focus.

1029
00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:33.760
No. no. no!

1030
00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:37.040
Where are my pictures?

1031
00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:40.040
Gone.

1032
00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:44.600
Is something wrong. son?

1033
00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:46.960
Yeah.

1034
00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:50.440
I need to talk to you about this wedding.

1035
00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:53.560
I believe she's upstairs
working on the invitation list.

1036
00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:54.600
Okay.

1037
00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:57.720
Father...

1038
00:58:57.800 --> 00:59:00.280
You're having reservations
about the marriage.

1039
00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:04.960
Are you and Mother happy. Father?

1040
00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:07.000
Of course. we are. I love your mother.

1041
00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:09.920
-But I always hear you arguing.
-We do not argue.

1042
00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:13.800
We have disagreements.
but when you live with one for so long.

1043
00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:16.080
it is bound to happen.
In any relationship.

1044
00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:18.360
It doesn't mean we don't love each other.

1045
00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:22.240
Are you worried that once married.

1046
00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:24.720
you and Catherine
will stop loving each other?

1047
00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:30.280
Or perhaps you love another?

1048
00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:32.000
What?

1049
00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:33.720
No. I...

1050
00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:38.840
I don't know.

1051
00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:40.440
Yes.

1052
00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:41.920
you do.

1053
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:45.000
I just don't want
to let you or Mother down.

1054
00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:47.520
Oh. you'll never let us down. Leo.

1055
00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:48.440
Never.

1056
00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:57.040
You may enter.

1057
00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:02.440
Hi. Sorry to disturb you. your Majesty.

1058
01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:04.600
Was there a power outage earlier?

1059
01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:08.200
Not that I'm aware of. Why do you ask?

1060
01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:12.400
Something happened with my computer
and I lost a lot of my files.

1061
01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:16.280
All the pictures I've been taking.

1062
01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:19.160
-Do you not make backups?
-Oh. I do.

1063
01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.680
And I was when my computer crashed.

1064
01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:26.320
I was just wondering
if I could borrow your system

1065
01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.160
and download the pictures for today.

1066
01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:31.240
It shouldn't take longer
than 30. 40 minutes tops.

1067
01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:32.640
Very well.

1068
01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:48.040
I can just... Oh. okay. Thank you.

1069
01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:07.680
Your stay here is coming to an end soon.

1070
01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:12.200
Yep. right after
the last two festivities are over.

1071
01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:16.320
I trust your visit has been satisfactory?

1072
01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:19.320
It's been wonderful.

1073
01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:24.400
Then why do I detect an air of sadness?

1074
01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:29.080
Me?

1075
01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:31.320
No. I'm fine. really.

1076
01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.880
You have a magnificent palace here.

1077
01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:43.000
and a wonderful husband
and loyal servants.

1078
01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:46.680
It really is the dream.

1079
01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:53.320
And I'm sure the Prince and the Duchess
will follow gloriously in your footsteps

1080
01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:55.400
and live happily ever after.

1081
01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:57.480
That is the plan.

1082
01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:00.040
Yes. and it's a top-notch plan.

1083
01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:01.880
I couldn't be happier for them.

1084
01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:15.880
This is going to take a while. so...

1085
01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.920
I'll come back. I have to...

1086
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.320
clean my lenses.

1087
01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:51.520
Welcome. one and all.

1088
01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:53.200
Christmas Eve is upon us.

1089
01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:55.000
as are the final two competitions.

1090
01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:59.240
This evening is
the Christmas Tree Decorating Contest:

1091
01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:01.480
the most festive decorating wins.

1092
01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:05.680
And tomorrow.

1093
01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.320
Christmas day.

1094
01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:09.160
everyone can take part

1095
01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:11.160
in our Spirit of Christmas Competition.

1096
01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:14.360
Pictures. sculptures. costumes...

1097
01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:16.800
Anything that best represents

1098
01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:19.480
the joy of our community
this holiday season

1099
01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:21.400
will win a special award.

1100
01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:26.680
Oh. and contributions
are still being accepted

1101
01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:30.040
to our Children's Fund.
so please. do give what you can.

1102
01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:33.200
Good luck.
and may the most festive spirit win.

1103
01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:36.880
Thank you.

1104
01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:38.520
I'll take over

1105
01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.280
Forget about her. Leo.

1106
01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:51.400
She's not who you think she is.

1107
01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:53.280
What do you mean by that?

1108
01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:54.360
You'll see.

1109
01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:56.200
Everyone will.

1110
01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.200
We must discuss Leo and Catherine.

1111
01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:00.760
Oh. not now.

1112
01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:02.840
There's so much to do.

1113
01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:12.520
We've got so much to plan. it's important.
Our families are counting on it.

1114
01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:15.320
Catherine. weddings should not be
about families.

1115
01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:18.760
It should be about two people in love.

1116
01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:20.680
That's what makes them special.

1117
01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:24.440
I agree. but ours is even more special
because it unites our kingdoms.

1118
01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:27.120
Is that how you feel
or how your parents feel?

1119
01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:29.720
Can't it be both?

1120
01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:32.160
I suppose so.

1121
01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:36.400
Catherine. please. stop.

1122
01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:39.040
I need to do this alone.

1123
01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:40.640
Do what?

1124
01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:42.600
Use the restroom facilities.

1125
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.920
Oh. of course. By all means.

1126
01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:47.760
Hurry back!

1127
01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:50.080
Miss you already!

1128
01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:03.040
You think you're so clever. don't you?

1129
01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:07.240
That's not something
I've ever been accused of.

1130
01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:10.080
Interesting choice of words...

1131
01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.280
"Accused."

1132
01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:17.840
I'm just here doing my job.

1133
01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:20.560
After tomorrow. I'm gone
and the Prince is all yours.

1134
01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:22.960
Oh. he was always mine.

1135
01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:26.560
I do hope you weren't foolish enough
to believe otherwise.

1136
01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:36.320
Yeah. Of course not.

1137
01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:46.840
Add more on this one.

1138
01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:48.920
Good evening. Stanley.

1139
01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:51.920
Duchess. How can I be of service?

1140
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.640
Actually. a hot cup of cocoa
would be wonderful.

1141
01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:55.760
Would you be a dear?

1142
01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:59.120
Well. you could ask Amanda

1143
01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:01.040
to make you one. I hear she's...

1144
01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:07.360
I'd love to. but I'm not supposed
to leave the box unattended. Madam.

1145
01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:10.560
I'll wait right here.

1146
01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:15.080
Be back in a jiffy.

1147
01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.280
Beautiful.

1148
01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:33.680
Hi.

1149
01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:40.240
Can I? Last batch.

1150
01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:42.000
Computer still not working?

1151
01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:45.240
Well. I don't want to take any chances.

1152
01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:46.720
Thank you.

1153
01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:51.880
Okay.

1154
01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:56.400
I must admit...

1155
01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:00.000
your work really is very good.

1156
01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:03.680
You've captured the heart
and soul of Pantrea.

1157
01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:06.160
Your work is full of emotion.

1158
01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:08.920
Thank you. your Majesty.

1159
01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.520
You're very kind.

1160
01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:15.880
I think my husband and my son
would disagree with you.

1161
01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:17.160
I doubt that.

1162
01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:20.320
I know you want
what's best for the kingdom.

1163
01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:22.560
You're very observant. my dear.

1164
01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:24.000
Occupational hazard.

1165
01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:29.760
What a pleasant sight to behold.

1166
01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:30.680
Richard.

1167
01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:33.800
come and see these photographs.
They are quite stunning.

1168
01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:39.360
Oh. this file is quite big.

1169
01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:42.080
I'll come back
when it's finished downloading.

1170
01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:44.840
You'll join us for brunch tomorrow?

1171
01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:46.440
Oh my gosh. no!

1172
01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:48.240
I wouldn't want to intrude.

1173
01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:49.440
Nonsense.

1174
01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:52.280
It is Christmas.
And while you're here. you're family.

1175
01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:54.040
Yes. do join us.

1176
01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:56.880
Oh. wow. That is really so nice of you.

1177
01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:59.080
OK. Thank you.

1178
01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:00.920
I'll see you tomorrow.

1179
01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:02.400
Ta-ta!

1180
01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:03.840
Ta-ta. indeed.

1181
01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:10.960
I'm glad to see you getting on so well.

1182
01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:13.880
I've nothing against the girl.

1183
01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:16.360
She's lovely and talented.

1184
01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:18.840
-But she's...
-Not of royal blood?

1185
01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:20.320
Exactly.

1186
01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:22.720
And you want what is best for our son?

1187
01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:23.720
Correct.

1188
01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:26.160
No matter if his heart loves another?

1189
01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:28.560
Has he told you that?

1190
01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:31.960
Not in so many words. but...

1191
01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:36.480
He's only just met the girl.

1192
01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:38.560
He is in love.

1193
01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:41.760
And Catherine is a duchess

1194
01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:44.240
and will make an excellent queen someday.

1195
01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:45.600
And a suitable wife.

1196
01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:49.840
But if you recall.
I refused my suitable bride

1197
01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:51.720
who came from royal blood.

1198
01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:53.120
And why?

1199
01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:56.000
Because I met a beautiful.

1200
01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:58.520
young. vibrant girl.

1201
01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:03.360
Do you remember how brave
we both had to be then?

1202
01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:07.040
They said our marriage wasn't allowed.
and yet.

1203
01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:08.200
here we are.

1204
01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:11.920
Just as in love today
as the day we first met.

1205
01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:15.680
That was a different time.

1206
01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:19.080
Time is the only difference.

1207
01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.640
She's an American.

1208
01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.200
Americans are people. too.

1209
01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:29.240
Or so I've heard.

1210
01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:38.240
Thank you for everything.

1211
01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:45.680
Am I in the wrong castle?

1212
01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:47.640
Why would you say that?

1213
01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:49.960
Smiling. laughing.

1214
01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:51.320
Not squabbling.

1215
01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:54.760
-We can squabble if you want. Leo.
-This is nice.

1216
01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:57.600
-Will Catherine be joining us?
-Sooner or later.

1217
01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:00.160
She said she has some sort of errand

1218
01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:01.400
to attend to first.

1219
01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:03.400
Would you like to fetch Amanda?

1220
01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:06.160
I don't think she wants anything
to do with me.

1221
01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:08.400
I think just the opposite.

1222
01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:14.360
Merry Christmas.

1223
01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:15.480
Merry. indeed.

1224
01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:17.720
I really must speak with you.

1225
01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:20.960
Yes. before you do.
there's something I have to say

1226
01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:22.040
to all of you.

1227
01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:23.240
What is it. my dear?

1228
01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:24.880
Well. firstly.

1229
01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:26.800
thank you.

1230
01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:29.520
You've all been so kind.
inviting me into your home

1231
01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:32.360
and you've treated me
like an honored guest.

1232
01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:37.440
At first. I was confused
because I thought you were expecting me.

1233
01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:39.120
-We were.
-No. you weren't.

1234
01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:40.680
Not "me" me.

1235
01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:42.640
Who's Mimi?

1236
01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:43.880
Another pseudonym?

1237
01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:46.440
No. there's no Mimi. Just me. me.

1238
01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:47.760
Beatrice Bitterly?

1239
01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:49.040
Present.

1240
01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:52.840
Who is this woman?

1241
01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:55.320
Amanda Eastman.

1242
01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:58.240
-You're Amanda Eastman?
-No. She is.

1243
01:10:58.560 --> 01:10:59.840
I am Beatrice Bitterly.

1244
01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:02.240
I am confused.

1245
01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:07.040
That woman has been lying to us
by pretending to be this woman:

1246
01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:09.640
the real Beatrice Bitterly.

1247
01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:12.680
And I'm bitterly disappointed. Amanda.

1248
01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
She's my assistant.

1249
01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:17.120
Was my assistant.

1250
01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:20.360
As soon as I received a call
from the Duchess

1251
01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:22.920
telling me what Amanda was up to.

1252
01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.760
I hopped on the first plane

1253
01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:26.000
to set things right.

1254
01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:27.120
You lied to me?

1255
01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:30.640
No. I actually asked you all
to call me Amanda.

1256
01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:33.840
But we never thought your real name
was your real name.

1257
01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:37.640
It was just a case of mistaken identity
that spiraled out of control.

1258
01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:39.520
You were dishonest from the start.

1259
01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:43.000
Capitalizing on a famous name
to make a name for yourself.

1260
01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:46.520
Did you really think
King Buckley would invite you.

1261
01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:49.560
a lowly assistant. into his royal palace?

1262
01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:52.280
-You could've told me.
-I tried.

1263
01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:55.520
I tried to try. but it was...

1264
01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:59.800
I'm afraid
we have a bit of an issue. Sire.

1265
01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:06.720
Who in this kingdom
would steal from children?

1266
01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:08.600
I wonder?

1267
01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:21.840
No. no. no.

1268
01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:23.960
I have nothing to do with this.

1269
01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:25.560
And why should we believe you?

1270
01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:27.720
You probably stole that dress.

1271
01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:29.960
No. I didn't. This was a gift.

1272
01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:37.200
I guess?

1273
01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:40.280
You can search me.

1274
01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:41.840
Search my things and my room!

1275
01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:43.560
I think that's a very good idea.

1276
01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:58.680
You have to...

1277
01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:13.640
Stanley?

1278
01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:21.040
Okay.

1279
01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:30.960
The room is clear.

1280
01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:39.360
It's all here.

1281
01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:46.720
You did this. You set me up.

1282
01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:48.080
Me?

1283
01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:50.560
I don't know what you're talking about.

1284
01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:52.320
I'd have this woman arrested.

1285
01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:56.200
A liar and a thief? Really. Amanda?

1286
01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:58.760
It's like I don't even know you.

1287
01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:00.160
None of us do.

1288
01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:02.480
Well. we have retrieved the money.

1289
01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:04.960
We needn't involve the authorities.

1290
01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.080
No.

1291
01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:08.520
The last thing this kingdom needs
is a scandal.

1292
01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:10.200
I'm shocked. Unbelievable.

1293
01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:12.280
You'll never get hired again.

1294
01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:14.480
The best thing would be if Amanda...

1295
01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:15.600
It is Amanda?

1296
01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:18.360
...if she got
the first flight back to the States.

1297
01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:19.280
I concur.

1298
01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:21.560
Stanley. you'll see
she gets to the airport?

1299
01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:22.640
Very well. Sire.

1300
01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:23.680
Come on. Leo.

1301
01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:26.520
We've wasted enough time on this...
this woman.

1302
01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:30.040
Madam.

1303
01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:34.760
I didn't do this. you know.

1304
01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:40.600
You're welcome to dine with us.
Ms. Bitterly.

1305
01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:43.720
Well. thank you. I'm starved.

1306
01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:46.200
I can never eat that airplane food.

1307
01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:50.720
Do let me know when you are ready.

1308
01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:52.440
Thanks. Stanley.

1309
01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:26.560
I didn't take that money. you know.

1310
01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:31.280
I believe you. Madam.

1311
01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:33.600
I truly do.

1312
01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:42.280
I love them. Leo. Thank you so much.

1313
01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:43.680
They're beautiful.

1314
01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:46.160
I told you. they're not from me.

1315
01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:49.880
Don't be ridiculous.
Who else would be my secret admirer?

1316
01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:52.160
I never even said goodbye to her.

1317
01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:55.360
You're not still going on
about that silly little thief. are you?

1318
01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:00.400
She was a menace.
We should celebrate being rid of her.

1319
01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.800
She got off easy.
I would've had her serving time.

1320
01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:05.760
It's Christmas. Catherine.

1321
01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:09.040
A time for giving and forgiving.

1322
01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:12.680
And this is my den.

1323
01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:16.480
So clean and tidy.

1324
01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:18.240
You should see mine.

1325
01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:21.440
It's cluttered.
But 'tis the life of an artist.

1326
01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:35.720
She's left her pictures behind.

1327
01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:37.400
I'm sure they're horrible.

1328
01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:41.240
The poor girl probably didn't know
which end of the camera to shoot from.

1329
01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:43.680
Actually. we found her photographs
rather good.

1330
01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:45.160
Excellent. I would say.

1331
01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:49.080
Richard. come here.

1332
01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:55.040
How do you enlarge a photograph?

1333
01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:57.000
Oh. well you just hit this key.

1334
01:16:58.040 --> 01:16:59.680
What is it you want to enlarge?

1335
01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:04.160
Is that?

1336
01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:06.640
I think it is.

1337
01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:10.160
You're breaking up with me?

1338
01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:13.080
-You'll find another prince.
-Where?

1339
01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:14.520
I love you!

1340
01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:16.320
Catherine. honestly.

1341
01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:18.880
I think you love the idea
of being a queen.

1342
01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:20.520
But me.

1343
01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:22.400
not so much.

1344
01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:26.760
And if I'm being really honest
with myself.

1345
01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:30.080
I'm in love with Amanda.

1346
01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:32.920
But she's a liar.

1347
01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:37.160
You were promised to me and I to you
when we were children.

1348
01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:40.240
I can't believe
you're in love with a thief.

1349
01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:43.920
There's only one thief in this palace.

1350
01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:49.200
And it is not Amanda Eastman.

1351
01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:11.720
Oh. we should...

1352
01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:14.560
Madam.

1353
01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:18.280
may I say.
I regret things had to end this way.

1354
01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:21.000
Me too. Stanley.

1355
01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:23.920
But I guess Christmas wishes
are just that. huh?

1356
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.040
Wishes.

1357
01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:31.200
Stanley Bishop. Chief of Protocol.

1358
01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:34.200
Yes. we're almost there. Sire.

1359
01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:38.360
Yes. of course.

1360
01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:40.120
Absolutely. Sire.

1361
01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:41.360
Right away.

1362
01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:07.680
-Am I in trouble again?
-Yes.

1363
01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:09.920
There's one more competition to judge:

1364
01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:12.240
Pantrea's Spirit of Christmas.

1365
01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:16.880
The submissions are in the great hall
and you haven't photographed there yet.

1366
01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:20.480
I can photograph this.
I'll charge you half my normal rate.

1367
01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:21.720
No. thank you.

1368
01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:23.640
We want Amanda.

1369
01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:26.440
-You do?
-I do.

1370
01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:30.840
I don't understand.

1371
01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:33.240
We saw your pictures.

1372
01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:41.080
It was my money in that stupid raffle.

1373
01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:45.040
I just want to be queen.
Is that too much to ask?

1374
01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:46.560
It is in Pantrea.

1375
01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:49.120
Well. when my father hears
about this. he will...

1376
01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:54.520
He will demand
you return his wedding gift.

1377
01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:56.840
That alone is cause to celebrate.

1378
01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:00.640
Would you like us to lock her up?

1379
01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:03.600
After all. it's what she wanted us
to do with you.

1380
01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:05.440
No. it's Christmas.

1381
01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:07.560
And besides. she returned the money

1382
01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:09.760
when she pointed out where to find it.

1383
01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:11.000
That's true.

1384
01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:12.360
Let her go.

1385
01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:14.480
Thank you. your Royal Highness.

1386
01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:17.600
I didn't mean to do any harm.
I just wanted to be queen

1387
01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:20.360
to make my parents proud.
It's how I was raised.

1388
01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:22.400
And now you all hate me.

1389
01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:24.640
I don't hate you. Catherine.

1390
01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:27.600
You're just not the right one for me.

1391
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.720
But I think I know who is.

1392
01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:35.640
Amanda. I...

1393
01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:40.120
Looks like I've fallen for you.

1394
01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:41.640
That's the third time.

1395
01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:43.640
You know what they say:

1396
01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:45.320
"Third time's the charm."

1397
01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:55.360
-Can you ever forgive me?
-For what?

1398
01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:56.640
For doubting you.

1399
01:20:57.800 --> 01:21:00.240
Stanley told me how special you are.

1400
01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:01.520
I should have listened.

1401
01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:04.160
Just hold that thought.

1402
01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:07.040
Stanley.

1403
01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:10.640
so you brought me the dresses
the other night?

1404
01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:12.800
I couldn't really say. Madam.

1405
01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:14.720
And the winning ticket?

1406
01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:20.960
It would be a nice gesture.

1407
01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:22.360
for helping you.

1408
01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:26.120
The winning raffle ticket is 205.

1409
01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:28.240
You little matchmaker. you.

1410
01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:30.160
Things we do for love.

1411
01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:38.400
I think the Duchess
might need a ride home.

1412
01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:41.160
I believe you may be right. Madam.

1413
01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:46.440
Sire.

1414
01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:49.160
I believe the Duchess

1415
01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:51.080
might need a ride back to her kingdom.

1416
01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:54.080
You're right. Stanley. could you?

1417
01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:57.680
It would be my pleasure. Sire. Madam.

1418
01:21:57.760 --> 01:21:59.240
Thank you. Stanley.

1419
01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:06.120
I wonder who did send me these earrings.

1420
01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:07.680
A secret admirer?

1421
01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:13.080
Perhaps we could figure
that one out together.

1422
01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:22.400
Well. I think we found the winner

1423
01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:24.680
that best represents
the spirit of Christmas.

1424
01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:27.000
Yes!

1425
01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:34.560
Finally! Did you get the package
I sent you?

1426
01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:35.840
Yes!

1427
01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:37.240
It's an advanced copy.

1428
01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:40.520
The magazine hits the stands next week.

1429
01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:44.560
All photos credited to you. baby.

1430
01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:48.200
Amanda Eastman!

1431
01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:50.640
So...

1432
01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:53.120
you know how to take a picture?

1433
01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:55.600
You're never working for me again.

1434
01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:58.520
Well. with all due respect. Beatrice.

1435
01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:00.840
I don't need to. I have my own name now.

1436
01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:04.040
And you're sticking to it?

1437
01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:07.040
Yeah. I wouldn't want to be anyone else.

1438
01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:09.800
How about Princess Amanda?

1439
01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:13.120
Princess Amanda.

1440
01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:14.920
