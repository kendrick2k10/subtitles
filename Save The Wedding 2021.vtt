Oh. yeah. that would explain
why the plastic wrap's off

by about an inch and a half
on the left side.

00:01:28.044 --> 00:01:30.090
-Hm.
-Is it that noticeable?

21
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.354
-Uh. a-a little.
-Oh. perfect timing.

22
00:01:33.484 --> 00:01:36.270
Don't panic!
I can treat the stain.

Where does your mom
keep her white vinegar?

00:01:38.837 --> 00:01:40.578
I don't know if she has that.

25
00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:43.451
Okay. I'll just get mine
out of my bag. then.

26
00:01:43.581 --> 00:01:45.322
You carry around white vinegar?

27
00:01:45.453 --> 00:01:46.584
Uh. do you know
how many different things

28
00:01:46.715 --> 00:01:48.238
this can be used for?
Never mind.

29
00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.110
We don't even have time
for that.

30
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.937
I packed your dinner-rehearsal
dress and two extras.

31
00:01:52.068 --> 00:01:54.331
they're hanging up
in your closet. I am positive

32
00:01:54.462 --> 00:01:55.941
I can get this stain out
in time. but. you know.

00:01:57.769 --> 00:01:59.075

-I love you.
-Oh. I love you more.

36
00:02:01.338 --> 00:02:03.906
Oh. just don't mention this
to Claire.

37
00:02:04.036 --> 00:02:05.560
She already thinks
I'm such a klutz.

38
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.604
Oh. that's not true.

39
00:02:06.735 --> 00:02:08.171
She asked if I needed a lid

40
00:02:08.302 --> 00:02:10.608
for my drink.
She thinks I need a sippy cup.

41
00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.567
She asked everyone that. I'm
sure she's probably just worried

42
00:02:12.697 --> 00:02:14.699
about her expensive floors.

43
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.615
She also had a mini melt down
because I grabbed paper napkins

44
00:02:17.746 --> 00:02:19.530
instead of cloth
for the snack table.

45
00:02:19.661 --> 00:02:21.141
Just look at the bright side.
I mean.

46
00:02:21.271 --> 00:02:23.534
at least it's in the comfort
of your own home.

47
00:02:23.665 --> 00:02:25.536
Besides. you love her son.

48
00:02:25.667 --> 00:02:27.973
He makes you the happiest girl
in the world.

49
00:02:28.104 --> 00:02:29.932
so at least she did that right.

50
00:02:30.062 --> 00:02:31.542
See! Look at that charming face!

51
00:02:31.673 --> 00:02:33.457
Hey. wifey!

52
00:02:35.677 --> 00:02:37.548
-Hey. Meg. how's it goin'?
-Hey.

Bride-to-be.

54
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.074
You're stressed. Is my mom
driving you crazy again?

55
00:02:42.205 --> 00:02:44.599
I-I promise. she's just
super excited about everything.

56
00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:46.688
Excited is one word for it.

57
00:02:46.818 --> 00:02:49.386
And we had a stain situation.
but Meg has it under control.

58
00:02:49.517 --> 00:02:51.736
Oh. Meg once again
saves the day. huh?

59
00:02:51.867 --> 00:02:53.434
Per usual.

60
00:02:53.564 --> 00:02:56.306
Hey. did you. um. did you talk
to her about the--

61
00:02:56.437 --> 00:02:57.873
Talked to me about what?

62
00:02:59.962 --> 00:03:02.312
-[Meg] I don't know. El.
-Consider it a wedding gift.

63
00:03:02.443 --> 00:03:04.445
No. you cannot play
the bride card on this one.

64
00:03:04.575 --> 00:03:05.707
Why not?

65
00:03:05.837 --> 00:03:06.795
Because you know
I don't like you

66
00:03:06.925 --> 00:03:08.231

67
00:03:08.362 --> 00:03:09.928

68
00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:11.495
Sam thinks
he'd be a great fit for you.

69
00:03:11.626 --> 00:03:13.410
And he's the best man.

70
00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:15.282
That doesn't make me feel
any better.

71
00:03:15.412 --> 00:03:17.936
And why is that always a thing.
setting up the bachelor best man

72
00:03:18.067 --> 00:03:19.677

maid of honor?

73
00:03:19.808 --> 00:03:21.723
You have to get back
on the horse sometime.

74
00:03:21.853 --> 00:03:24.421
Ellie. I told you. horses aren't
in the budget for this one.

-[doorknob rattling]
-[chuckles]

76
00:03:27.424 --> 00:03:30.427

ready five minutes ago.

77
00:03:30.558 --> 00:03:33.169
The ladies from my bridge club
will be here any moment.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.302
-I'll get ready right now.
-The bride can't be late.

79
00:03:35.432 --> 00:03:37.782
It sets a bad precedent
for your big day.

80
00:03:37.913 --> 00:03:38.957
I'll be right there.

00:03:39.088 --> 00:03:40.176
That was a lovely shower you

82
00:03:40.307 --> 00:03:41.221
put together. though. Claire.

83
00:03:41.351 --> 00:03:42.657
Oh. yes.

84
00:03:42.787 --> 00:03:45.181
I noticed
you rearranged the snack table

85
00:03:45.312 --> 00:03:46.835
and the picture display.

86
00:03:46.965 --> 00:03:49.054
Sorry. sometimes
I just can't help myself.

87
00:03:50.665 --> 00:03:52.275
The clock is ticking.

88
00:03:53.972 --> 00:03:55.409
And that is my cue to leave.

89
00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:57.933
-Already?
-Yeah. Work.

Claire does not want me here.

She may think
that you're a klutz.

92
00:04:01.415 --> 00:04:03.547
but she thinks
I put my hands on everything.

93
00:04:03.678 --> 00:04:06.028
It's my house.
and I want you here.

94
00:04:06.158 --> 00:04:07.377
Elle. I will be here
this afternoon

95
00:04:07.508 --> 00:04:10.989
when the real guests arrive.
Okay?

96
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.253
Oh. and your dress is dry.

97
00:04:15.298 --> 00:04:18.083
No. of course. we can do
a plated dinner. a buffet

98
00:04:18.214 --> 00:04:19.955
and any kind of cuisine
you want.

99
00:04:21.173 --> 00:04:23.132
Yes. of course. Okay.

100
00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:26.440
Well. I am looking forward
to it. Okay. you. too. Bye.

101
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.181
-Lovely. Do you have a second?
-Oh. yeah. anything for you.

102
00:04:29.312 --> 00:04:30.574
Have you heard
from the bakery? I mean...

103
00:04:30.705 --> 00:04:32.054
The order was supposed to be
here an hour ago

104
00:04:32.184 --> 00:04:34.230
and I guess the driver's MIA.

105
00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:36.885
This donut wall is turning
into an epic disaster.

106
00:04:37.015 --> 00:04:38.930
There's going to be a wall.
no donuts.

107
00:04:39.061 --> 00:04:40.410
so something
needs to be done now.

108
00:04:40.541 --> 00:04:42.456
Yes. uh. Gary blew out
his back tire.

109
00:04:42.586 --> 00:04:44.893
but I called The Donut Hole
and they are dispatching

110
00:04:45.023 --> 00:04:47.243
a new driver to pick up
the goods. so all is good.

111
00:04:47.374 --> 00:04:50.290
-Okay. Well done.
-Don't mention it.

112
00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.639
So this isn't the only reason
that I wanted

113
00:04:51.769 --> 00:04:53.162
to talk to you. though.

just fell through.

you can handle it.

but this is
a huge opportunity for us.

134

We haven't had someone
this big since ever.

135
00:05:41.776 --> 00:05:44.648
Rest assured. there is plenty
of room on my plate.

I'm hungry. Starving.

137

Good. 'cause she's in my office.
Now let's go.

-Wait. what?
-Now. Move it.

139
00:05:52.613 --> 00:05:53.657
So how long do you think we need

140
00:05:53.788 --> 00:05:55.616
to get this thing
up and running?

141
00:05:55.746 --> 00:05:57.313
Ten to fourteen months
seems to be the sweet spot

142
00:05:57.444 --> 00:05:58.706
for most of our clients.

143
00:05:58.836 --> 00:06:00.447
I'd prefer something
a bit sooner.

144
00:06:00.577 --> 00:06:02.449
I was hoping to get married
next month.

145
00:06:02.579 --> 00:06:05.234
Can you work with that?
That's doable. right?

146
00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:07.149
I don't wanna give the press
too much notice.

147
00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:09.804
Um. yes. uh. we would just
really have to move fast.

148
00:06:09.934 --> 00:06:11.153
Uh. what is your head count?

149
00:06:11.283 --> 00:06:12.284
I trimmed the guest list down

150
00:06:12.415 --> 00:06:14.983
to about 500 or so.

151
00:06:15.113 --> 00:06:20.380
Uh. wow. You are having a giant
celebration. That's fantastic.

152
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.079
I'm in love! I want to shout it
from the rooftops!

153
00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:27.735
I've met my forever person.
and I've waited my entire life.

154
00:06:27.865 --> 00:06:29.911
I don't wanna wait any longer.
You know what I mean?

155
00:06:30.041 --> 00:06:32.348
Yeah. I know what you mean.
It's. like. love.

156
00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:36.918
It. it blossoms every day. Uh...

157
00:06:37.048 --> 00:06:40.138
I want everyone from my mail
carrier to my hairstylist

158
00:06:40.269 --> 00:06:42.053
to share our love.

159
00:06:42.184 --> 00:06:44.969
Oh. and I've decided to cover
all expenses for my guests.

160
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.928
so if you could organize
flights and hotels

161
00:06:47.058 --> 00:06:48.756
when the RSVPs come in...

162
00:06:48.886 --> 00:06:52.281
Yeah. I would just need a list
with numbers. and I'm on it.

163
00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:53.587
There will also be
a lot of children.

164
00:06:53.717 --> 00:06:55.502
and I'd like to
keep them occupied.

165
00:06:55.632 --> 00:06:57.068
So if you could put together.
like. a carnival

166
00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:58.635
or a petting zoo or something...

167
00:06:58.766 --> 00:07:01.725
Yeah. kid-friendly attractions
are a great idea.

168
00:07:01.856 --> 00:07:06.164
I would also love some Hawaiian
fire dancers for the reception.

169
00:07:06.295 --> 00:07:08.863
Fire dancers? Okay.

170
00:07:08.993 --> 00:07:11.126
I would also contact
the fire department

171
00:07:11.256 --> 00:07:15.130
for reviews and permits.
On it.

172
00:07:19.526 --> 00:07:22.572
Oh. Ellie.
I'm so glad you're here.

173
00:07:22.703 --> 00:07:24.531
-Guess what I just found out.
-What?

174
00:07:24.661 --> 00:07:27.142
I am doing
Valerie Ford's wedding.

175
00:07:27.272 --> 00:07:30.188
-Congratulations!
-Thank you.

176
00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:34.149
[sighs] But enough about me.
How was shower number one?

177
00:07:34.279 --> 00:07:36.760
Better than expected. The ladies
from the bridge club adored me.

178
00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:39.676
Well. that's no surprise.

179
00:07:39.807 --> 00:07:41.852
I just have a few things that
I'd like to finalize with you.

180
00:07:41.983 --> 00:07:44.638
Like what? You've been on top of
everything since the proposal.

181
00:07:44.768 --> 00:07:46.988
I know you weren't able to
really commit to a color palette

182
00:07:47.118 --> 00:07:49.730
for dinner. and you liked yellow
'cause it went with the flowers.

183
00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.558
but we weren't able to commit
to a pink.

184
00:07:51.688 --> 00:07:53.777
I commit to pink.
It sounds pretty.

185
00:07:53.908 --> 00:07:56.867
Uh. Ellie. that doesn't
narrow it down. like. at all.

186
00:07:56.998 --> 00:07:58.260
Light pink?

187
00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:59.827
I have an entire binder here.

188
00:07:59.957 --> 00:08:03.831
-Full of pink swatches.
-Hm.

189
00:08:03.961 --> 00:08:06.529
You know. I trust you to make
these kind of decisions.

190
00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.184
You're not only my wedding
planner. you're my best friend.

191
00:08:09.314 --> 00:08:12.361
And I can't wait to be there for
the biggest day of your life.

192
00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:15.495
-Wow. it crept up quickly!
-Imagine how I feel.

193
00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:18.062
-A bundle full of nerves?
-Uh...

194
00:08:18.193 --> 00:08:21.588
-All brides-to-be are.
-Yeah. you're probably right.

195
00:08:21.718 --> 00:08:24.112
I just. I haven't been able
to sleep too well. either.

196
00:08:24.242 --> 00:08:27.028
Well. you are going to be
so happy that you decided

197
00:08:27.158 --> 00:08:29.552
to stay local as opposed
to a summer destination wedding.

198
00:08:29.683 --> 00:08:32.337
I mean. yeah. the beach backdrop
is beautiful.

199
00:08:32.468 --> 00:08:35.166
but people tend to forget that
sand is like nature's glitter

200
00:08:35.297 --> 00:08:36.646
and it just gets everywhere.

201
00:08:36.777 --> 00:08:41.564
-[chuckles]
-So are you excited for tonight?

202
00:08:41.695 --> 00:08:46.047
You mean. the part you planned?
Obviously. Are you excited?

203
00:08:46.177 --> 00:08:49.354
You get to meet the best man.
He's coming by later with Sam.

204
00:08:49.485 --> 00:08:51.835
Oh. Can't wait.

205
00:08:51.966 --> 00:08:54.751
Thank you so much. everybody.
for coming to attend

206
00:08:54.882 --> 00:08:56.405
our Ellie's bridal shower.

207
00:08:56.536 --> 00:09:00.322
-Um. uh. second.
-[Meg] Second bridal shower.

208
00:09:00.452 --> 00:09:02.106
If anyone would like
to say a few words

209
00:09:02.237 --> 00:09:03.804
about our beautiful bride.

210
00:09:03.934 --> 00:09:06.894
we should have a few minutes
right after we open gifts.

211
00:09:07.024 --> 00:09:09.026
Oh. and if anyone has moved
in the past three months.

212
00:09:09.157 --> 00:09:10.985
I do not have your address
on file. so come see me

213
00:09:11.115 --> 00:09:12.856
before you leave this eve.

214
00:09:14.336 --> 00:09:16.033
I'll start with this one!

215
00:09:17.513 --> 00:09:18.862
Okay.

216
00:09:21.648 --> 00:09:23.214
-Thank you! I love it.
-Oh!

217
00:09:23.345 --> 00:09:25.869
Well. now you can make smoothies
all the time at home.

218
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.132
You know. the green ones
that you like.

219
00:09:28.263 --> 00:09:30.657
Add a little almond milk
add a little blueberry.

220
00:09:30.787 --> 00:09:33.355
a coconut milk. She's
lactose intolerant. you know?

221
00:09:33.485 --> 00:09:36.532
Okay. this one is from me.
and it is so awesome.

222
00:09:36.663 --> 00:09:39.404
I think I might have to take
two swag bags in return.

223
00:09:39.535 --> 00:09:43.060
Aww. thank you.
[gasps] I love it!

224
00:09:43.191 --> 00:09:45.802
It's a fairy tiara
for your wedding.

225
00:09:45.933 --> 00:09:48.979
-It's so cute!
-[laptop keys clacking]

226
00:09:59.816 --> 00:10:02.297
Oh. Sorry.

227
00:10:02.427 --> 00:10:04.647
I'll go get the desserts ready.

228
00:10:06.823 --> 00:10:08.999
[indistinct chatter]

229
00:10:15.876 --> 00:10:17.486
What are you doing?

230
00:10:18.574 --> 00:10:20.271
Tyler?

231
00:10:20.402 --> 00:10:23.231
Hey. It's been a while.

232
00:10:23.361 --> 00:10:25.668
What are you doing here?

233
00:10:25.799 --> 00:10:28.410
I'm the best man.
What are you doing here?

234
00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.760
Of course you are. just my luck.

235
00:10:30.891 --> 00:10:32.283
And can you please get out
of those?

236
00:10:32.414 --> 00:10:33.937
I was just about to bring
these out to the party.

237
00:10:34.068 --> 00:10:35.765
What-what are you.
like. the-the wedding planner?

238
00:10:35.896 --> 00:10:38.376
Yeah. and the maid of honor.
thank you very much.

239
00:10:38.507 --> 00:10:39.987
Of course you are.
Well. you need help?

240
00:10:40.117 --> 00:10:43.643
-I-I can take this for you.
-No. no. no. it's fine.

241
00:10:43.773 --> 00:10:46.907
Only now I need to replace two
of the cupcakes that you ate.

242
00:10:47.037 --> 00:10:48.735
Thankfully.
I have extras in the fridge.

243
00:10:48.865 --> 00:10:51.563
Or we could make some slight

244
00:10:51.694 --> 00:10:54.001
modifications
and nobody else will know.

245
00:10:54.131 --> 00:10:56.917
-Hands off the cakes. Tyler.
-I'm only trying to help.

246
00:10:57.047 --> 00:10:59.397
That's exactly what
the best man does.

247
00:10:59.528 --> 00:11:01.138
Not only were these
color coordinated.

248
00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:03.140
but they are also organized
by dietary restrictions.

249
00:11:03.271 --> 00:11:06.143
And guess what? You just
cross-contaminated everything.

250
00:11:06.274 --> 00:11:08.537
-Uh. that's not good.
-Yeah. it's not ideal.

251
00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:12.323
But I can fix it. if you don't
mind giving me a little space?

252
00:11:12.454 --> 00:11:14.151
-Or we can move it over here--
-No. no. no.

253
00:11:14.282 --> 00:11:15.849
-Please. just put it back down.
-It'll be so much easier.

254
00:11:15.979 --> 00:11:17.981
-Tyler. Tyler. please. please...
-Whoa.

255
00:11:18.112 --> 00:11:19.635
[Tyler] Uh...

256
00:11:19.766 --> 00:11:22.725
This isn't happening.

257
00:11:22.856 --> 00:11:24.161
Hey. how's the desserts
coming along?

258
00:11:24.292 --> 00:11:25.815
Claire's already asking.
of course.

259
00:11:25.946 --> 00:11:27.774
[gasps] Look. it's Tyler.

260
00:11:27.904 --> 00:11:30.124
This is the guy
we've been telling you about.

261
00:11:30.254 --> 00:11:31.734
Yeah. I know Tyler.

262
00:11:31.865 --> 00:11:34.171
And if he would
just listen to me for once--

263
00:11:34.302 --> 00:11:36.913
Or if you can consider
an outside opinion for once.

264
00:11:37.044 --> 00:11:39.176
It doesn't have to always be
Meg Mooreland's mottos.

265
00:11:39.307 --> 00:11:41.178
These floor cakes
are your fault.

266
00:11:41.309 --> 00:11:43.528
And I bet
they taste really good.

267
00:11:43.659 --> 00:11:46.009
You two do remember each other.

268
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.925
Aw. it's just like old times.

269
00:11:53.669 --> 00:11:56.019
I still can't believe
you tried to set me up with him.

270
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:57.891
You know we've bumped heads
since college.

271
00:11:58.021 --> 00:12:00.023
I had no idea. I thought
that was just the way

272
00:12:00.154 --> 00:12:01.590
you two flirted.

273
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:03.897
We had Economics together.

274
00:12:04.027 --> 00:12:06.203
[sighs] We had to work
on this group project.

275
00:12:06.334 --> 00:12:08.815
Well. I worked on it 'cause
I had to redo all of his work

276
00:12:08.945 --> 00:12:10.860
because he was just so lazy.

277
00:12:10.991 --> 00:12:13.123
And the only time he wasn't lazy
is whenever he would

278
00:12:13.254 --> 00:12:14.995
argue any point
that I made in class

279
00:12:15.125 --> 00:12:17.780
because he thought
I was a know-it-all.

280
00:12:17.911 --> 00:12:20.478
Yeah. He does like to get a rise
out of people.

281
00:12:20.609 --> 00:12:23.046
And he dropped your dessert.

282
00:12:25.005 --> 00:12:28.704
Okay. now
on to the important stuff.

283
00:12:28.835 --> 00:12:31.489
I know that you passed on
a bachelorette party.

284
00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:34.797
but I was thinking. since
everyone from the bridal party's

285
00:12:34.928 --> 00:12:36.668
gonna be under one roof
at the chalet.

286
00:12:36.799 --> 00:12:39.236
that we just have like a
little makeshift one. you know?

287
00:12:39.367 --> 00:12:42.762
Mm. that's a sweet gesture. but
I don't think it's necessary.

288
00:12:42.892 --> 00:12:44.807
Just think of it
like a sleepover.

289
00:12:44.938 --> 00:12:46.504
-You know. we can play games.
-Yeah.

290
00:12:46.635 --> 00:12:48.202
But it's extra work for you

291
00:12:48.332 --> 00:12:51.466
and I'm already overwhelmed
as it is. you know?

292
00:12:54.164 --> 00:12:57.472
You already planned
all the games. haven't you?

293
00:12:57.602 --> 00:12:59.822
-Maybe a few.
-[both chuckling]

294
00:12:59.953 --> 00:13:02.129
Okay. fine.
We can play some games.

295
00:13:02.259 --> 00:13:05.349
Great. then all I need from you

296
00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.570
is to just fill out
this little questionnaire.

297
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.355
Super simple. Shoe size.
favorite movie. first date.

298
00:13:11.486 --> 00:13:13.314
And then we see
who knows you the best.

299
00:13:13.444 --> 00:13:17.057
Okay. but I don't think anyone's
gonna know any of these answers.

300
00:13:17.187 --> 00:13:18.275
I did.

301
00:13:18.406 --> 00:13:20.190
You know more about me
than I do.

302
00:13:20.321 --> 00:13:21.931
You were my little sister
in our sorority.

303
00:13:22.062 --> 00:13:23.933
It was kind of my job.

304
00:13:24.064 --> 00:13:25.456
Besides. why do you think
Sam calls me

305
00:13:25.587 --> 00:13:27.371
asking for date recommendations?

306
00:13:27.502 --> 00:13:30.026
Speaking of.
Sam was supposed to be here

307
00:13:30.157 --> 00:13:31.898
half an hour ago
to work on vows.

308
00:13:32.028 --> 00:13:33.464
Ah. I'm sure he'll be here soon.
he's probably

309
00:13:33.595 --> 00:13:34.988
just stuck at your parents'.

310
00:13:35.118 --> 00:13:36.816
No. he texted me earlier
when he left.

311
00:13:36.946 --> 00:13:38.992
He said he was gonna grab a
quick bite with Tyler and then--

312
00:13:39.122 --> 00:13:41.211
Oh. that's why.

313
00:13:41.342 --> 00:13:43.344
-What?
-He's with Tyler.

314
00:13:43.474 --> 00:13:45.650
He could be
halfway around the world by now.

315
00:13:45.781 --> 00:13:50.003
-Oh. come on. he's not that bad.
-Let me ask you a question.

316
00:13:50.133 --> 00:13:53.136
Would you eat sushi
if it wasn't that bad?

317
00:13:53.267 --> 00:13:57.097
[laughs] Okay. I know you have
strong opinions about him.

318
00:13:57.227 --> 00:14:00.796
but you have to get along.
at least for the next week.

319
00:14:00.927 --> 00:14:04.539
[sighs] Okay. fine.
I will try my best.

320
00:14:04.669 --> 00:14:06.584
Thank you.

321
00:14:06.715 --> 00:14:09.587
-[laughs]
-[cell phone beeps]

322
00:14:09.718 --> 00:14:13.548
-Finally. They just parked.
-See. I told you.

323
00:14:13.678 --> 00:14:15.071
Now you just figure your vows

324
00:14:15.202 --> 00:14:17.378
and I will finish the packing
for us.

325
00:14:23.732 --> 00:14:25.777
Need a hand?

326
00:14:25.908 --> 00:14:28.737
Uh. yeah. actually. if you could
pack these up in the trunk

327
00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:30.826
once I'm done.
that would be amazing.

328
00:14:30.957 --> 00:14:33.176
And it would help me save
some time in the morning.

329
00:14:33.307 --> 00:14:35.831
-Okay. Sure thing.
-[Meg] Thanks.

330
00:14:35.962 --> 00:14:38.138
I assume you don't trust me
with anything else.

331
00:14:38.268 --> 00:14:39.966
Your assumption's accurate.

332
00:14:40.096 --> 00:14:42.446
That was a great shower
you put on for Ellie. though.

333
00:14:42.577 --> 00:14:44.579
You know. pretty and perfect.
like I know you like it.

334
00:14:44.709 --> 00:14:47.625
Ah. yeah.
Not even you could ruin it.

335
00:14:47.756 --> 00:14:49.627
Well. if you didn't get
so grabby in the kitchen...

336
00:14:49.758 --> 00:14:51.281
You know. I was just trying
to be the best man

337
00:14:51.412 --> 00:14:53.109
and compliment the party
you put together.

338
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.460
Um. it's my job to put my hands
on things. okay?

339
00:14:56.591 --> 00:14:59.246
I am the maid of honor.
slash wedding planner.

340
00:14:59.376 --> 00:15:02.640
You're not the only one around
here to have a fancy title.

341
00:15:02.771 --> 00:15:04.381
Okay. but if you wanna be
a good best man.

342
00:15:04.512 --> 00:15:05.817
you have to listen
to the wedding planner.

343
00:15:05.948 --> 00:15:07.602
Oh. I can do that.
if she wouldn't mind

344
00:15:07.732 --> 00:15:09.082
listening to some of my ideas.

345
00:15:09.212 --> 00:15:11.258
Mm. Maybe you just
follow my lead.

346
00:15:11.388 --> 00:15:15.044
Look. Sam is super sentimental.
and he keeps these trinkets

347
00:15:15.175 --> 00:15:16.698
and mementos.
and I was thinking--

348
00:15:16.828 --> 00:15:19.309
Tyler. I have it all
under control. okay?

349
00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.443
Okay. Well. are the bags ready?
'Cause I need to get going.

350
00:15:22.573 --> 00:15:26.534
Uh. yes. just one minute.
Valerie. hi.

351
00:15:26.664 --> 00:15:29.537
-Hey. Meg. do you have a sec?
-Yeah. No. it's a great time...

352
00:15:29.667 --> 00:15:31.147
[Valerie]
The RSVPs have been rolling in

353
00:15:31.278 --> 00:15:33.323
and people want
their travel itineraries.

354
00:15:33.454 --> 00:15:35.151
Could you get that sorted ASAP?

355
00:15:35.282 --> 00:15:37.545
I have a few cousins
coming all the way from Greece.

356
00:15:37.675 --> 00:15:39.503
Yeah. I-I'm on it.
if you could just text me

357
00:15:39.634 --> 00:15:41.462
all the names
so I can prioritize them?

358
00:15:41.592 --> 00:15:44.030
And I'll have everything
emailed and booked ASAP.

359
00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.032
[Valerie] Thank goodness.
they'll also

360
00:15:46.162 --> 00:15:47.903
need a guide
for things to do around town.

361
00:15:48.034 --> 00:15:50.210
Oh. yeah. I mean.
you gotta keep them busy.

362
00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.821
I will have everything to you
by tomorrow morning. I promise.

363
00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:55.258
No. it was definitely February.

364
00:15:55.389 --> 00:15:59.132
Uh. I-I don't think so.
That seems kind of quick.

365
00:15:59.262 --> 00:16:01.177
Yeah.
it was definitely your birthday.

366
00:16:01.308 --> 00:16:03.049
Seriously. you don't remember
the first time

367
00:16:03.179 --> 00:16:04.050
you met my parents?

368
00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:05.181
[Sam] Hey. o-okay.

369
00:16:05.312 --> 00:16:07.227
I-I didn't forget meeting them.

370
00:16:07.357 --> 00:16:11.361
It's just. the time of year
is just. you know. fuzzy.

371
00:16:11.492 --> 00:16:13.450
You stuffed your jacket pocket
with those heart-shaped mints

372
00:16:13.581 --> 00:16:16.105
from the hostess because
I said I liked them. remember?

373
00:16:16.236 --> 00:16:18.847
It was definitely February.
My birthday's in the summer.

374
00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:23.243
Oh. yeah. it's. uh. yeah. it's
kinda coming back to me now.

375
00:16:23.373 --> 00:16:25.680
What other important things
do you not remember?

376
00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:27.943
Hey. I...

377
00:16:28.074 --> 00:16:31.251
I haven't forgotten
how much I love you.

378
00:16:31.381 --> 00:16:33.949
Sam. we need to be on
the same page with these vows.

379
00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.473
or otherwise what's the point?

380
00:16:36.604 --> 00:16:38.127
[exhales sharply]

381
00:16:38.258 --> 00:16:41.478
Okay. you. too. Bye.

382
00:16:41.609 --> 00:16:43.393
Ellie and Sam
are fighting again.

383
00:16:43.524 --> 00:16:45.004
Have you noticed them
bickering lately?

384
00:16:45.134 --> 00:16:47.484
That's weddings for you.
They're fine.

385
00:16:47.615 --> 00:16:50.531
-They don't look fine.
-They're doing their vows.

386
00:16:50.661 --> 00:16:52.098
It's a sweet gesture.
but it's definitely opening up

387
00:16:52.228 --> 00:16:53.751
a new can of stress.

388
00:16:53.882 --> 00:16:55.971
It's normal. I promise.
They're fine.

389
00:16:56.102 --> 00:16:58.234
Well. I hope that's all it is.

390
00:16:58.365 --> 00:16:59.670
So you gonna take out
the bags today

391
00:16:59.801 --> 00:17:01.759
or are they too heavy for you?

392
00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:02.891
Yes.

393
00:17:04.936 --> 00:17:07.896
[instrumental music]

394
00:17:14.424 --> 00:17:16.470
Oh. Hey. You got here fast.

395
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.733
Yeah. I think
I missed rush hour.

396
00:17:18.863 --> 00:17:21.388
Have a seat. Thank you
for coming on such short notice.

397
00:17:21.518 --> 00:17:24.347
Yeah. of course.
I can see you're the last one

398
00:17:24.478 --> 00:17:26.175
left at work. as always.

399
00:17:26.306 --> 00:17:29.352
Well. you kinda have to be when
you do all the work yourself.

400
00:17:29.483 --> 00:17:33.835
You wanted to. You thought group
project meant Meg project.

401
00:17:33.965 --> 00:17:36.359
However you wanna remember it.

402
00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:37.969
I would have given these to you
sooner. but the jeweler

403
00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.059
just called a few hours ago.

404
00:17:40.189 --> 00:17:43.192
-Wow. You trust me with these?
-You literally have one job.

405
00:17:43.323 --> 00:17:45.238
Guard these with your life.

406
00:17:46.978 --> 00:17:48.589
Okay. sure. Copy that.

407
00:17:48.719 --> 00:17:51.026
-I have something for you. too.
-Oh?

408
00:17:51.157 --> 00:17:52.984
It's a box I took
from Sam's place.

409
00:17:53.115 --> 00:17:54.247
Remember I was telling you
earlier about

410
00:17:54.377 --> 00:17:55.813
how he likes keepsakes?

411
00:17:55.944 --> 00:17:58.860
I was thinking maybe you could
do something nice

412
00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:02.864
with it for Ellie. I don't know.
It's good to have.

413
00:18:02.994 --> 00:18:06.433
Aww. that's really sweet.
Thank you. Tyler.

414
00:18:06.563 --> 00:18:07.825
You're welcome.

415
00:18:09.479 --> 00:18:11.264
Well. uh. I'll let you
get back to work.

416
00:18:11.394 --> 00:18:12.482
Thanks.

417
00:18:13.657 --> 00:18:15.572
And try and get some sleep.

418
00:18:15.703 --> 00:18:17.313
You know.
we got a big day tomorrow.

419
00:18:17.444 --> 00:18:19.402
Oh. you do not have to worry
about me.

420
00:18:19.533 --> 00:18:21.839
I know. I don't.

421
00:18:30.674 --> 00:18:34.591
Can you not pace? It's making me
more anxious than I already am.

422
00:18:34.722 --> 00:18:36.027
Sorry.

423
00:18:38.595 --> 00:18:40.989
I didn't get much sleep
last night.

424
00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.079
Valerie wants the world.
and I'm just not sure

425
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:47.387
I can get the world
ready in time.

426
00:18:47.517 --> 00:18:49.302
Were you able to finish the vows
with Sam?

427
00:18:49.432 --> 00:18:51.782
Sort of...

428
00:18:51.913 --> 00:18:54.089
-Not really.
-Why not?

429
00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:55.830
It's easy. right? I love you.

430
00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.484
I take you to be
my lawfully wedded wife.

431
00:18:57.614 --> 00:18:59.225
-Right?
-[cell phone beeps]

432
00:18:59.355 --> 00:19:00.617
I'm struggling to say
how I feel.

433
00:19:00.748 --> 00:19:02.793
Something doesn't make sense.

434
00:19:04.926 --> 00:19:08.103
Sorry. that was the petting zoo.

435
00:19:08.234 --> 00:19:09.670
I just. I don't know what to do.

436
00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.062
Every time I start to write.
I think.

437
00:19:11.193 --> 00:19:12.847
"What is Claire gonna say
about that?"

438
00:19:12.977 --> 00:19:14.153
[cell phone beeps]

439
00:19:18.722 --> 00:19:20.289
Well. you will have plenty
of time to figure it out

440
00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:24.511
on the way to the chalet.
Are you. uh. ready to go?

441
00:19:24.641 --> 00:19:26.469
Yeah. Sam said
Tyler is on his way over

442
00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:27.905
and asked if we could caravan
together and grab--

443
00:19:28.036 --> 00:19:29.603
Wait. what? Why?
No. No. no. no.

444
00:19:29.733 --> 00:19:32.258
He's gonna seriously put us
way behind schedule.

445
00:19:32.388 --> 00:19:35.783
-[doorbell rings]
-Looks like he's on time.

446
00:19:35.913 --> 00:19:38.873
Maybe you should give him
some more credit.

447
00:19:39.003 --> 00:19:41.049
[Ellie] Kathy? Hey!
How are you? Come on in.

448
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:44.400
Hi. ladies. I am so glad
I caught you before you left.

449
00:19:44.531 --> 00:19:46.402
Meg. you haven't been
answering your phone.

450
00:19:46.533 --> 00:19:48.448
Oh. yeah. sorry.
It's been in use nonstop today.

451
00:19:48.578 --> 00:19:50.189
Wedding. wedding. weddings!
You know how it is.

452
00:19:50.319 --> 00:19:53.627
Yes. weddings.
That's why I'm here. actually.

453
00:19:53.757 --> 00:19:57.805
Um. I have some good news
and some bad news.

454
00:19:57.935 --> 00:19:59.720
What's going on?

455
00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:01.939
See. um.
I overbooked your rental.

456
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.637
Overbooked it?
How is that even possible?

457
00:20:03.767 --> 00:20:05.465
I literally put in a reservation
months ago.

458
00:20:05.595 --> 00:20:09.033
I know. I'm so sorry.
This has never happened before.

459
00:20:09.164 --> 00:20:11.819
I think it was this intern
I had. She wasn't that great.

460
00:20:11.949 --> 00:20:15.518
Anyway. this group of guests
arrived for a family reunion

461
00:20:15.649 --> 00:20:18.565
and I called about the keys.
and I just lost it.

462
00:20:18.695 --> 00:20:21.089
I promise I will find you
another great venue.

463
00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.353
Okay. but this is her wedding.
Can't you just move the reunion?

464
00:20:24.484 --> 00:20:26.877
I tried. It's 20 people.

465
00:20:27.008 --> 00:20:30.011
Twenty very unmoving people.

466
00:20:30.141 --> 00:20:31.621
Hey. What's going on?

467
00:20:31.752 --> 00:20:34.711
An overbooking.
I can't believe it.

468
00:20:34.842 --> 00:20:37.584
I'll issue you
a full refund ASAP.

469
00:20:37.714 --> 00:20:40.804
But on to the good news.
we have options!

470
00:20:40.935 --> 00:20:43.154
-The show must go on!
-Let me see that.

471
00:20:43.285 --> 00:20:46.070
Anything in there.
20 percent discounted.

472
00:20:47.115 --> 00:20:48.769
[door opens]

473
00:20:50.205 --> 00:20:53.339
-What's going on. guys?
-Not much.

474
00:20:53.469 --> 00:20:55.384
We got to find a new venue.

475
00:20:55.515 --> 00:20:57.865
Do you have anything nicer?

476
00:20:57.995 --> 00:21:02.217
It's wedding season. and all
our other venues are booked.

477
00:21:02.348 --> 00:21:03.653
Why don't we just have it
at Sam's parents' house

478
00:21:03.784 --> 00:21:05.307
where we're all staying
this weekend?

479
00:21:05.438 --> 00:21:08.223
Your parents will be fine
with that. right. Sam?

480
00:21:08.354 --> 00:21:10.486
Oh. yeah. you know.
Claire will just love that.

481
00:21:10.617 --> 00:21:13.446
Hey. look. honey. I-I don't
think we have much of a choice.

482
00:21:13.576 --> 00:21:14.795
I mean...

483
00:21:15.926 --> 00:21:17.145
[cell phone beeps]

484
00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:23.630
[instrumental music]

485
00:21:53.355 --> 00:21:54.661
Wow!

486
00:21:54.791 --> 00:21:58.882
-This place is stunning!
-Yeah. not bad. huh?

487
00:21:59.013 --> 00:22:01.145
I can't believe we're getting
married at your parents' house.

488
00:22:01.276 --> 00:22:04.018
-The other place had a sauna.
-Well. weddings are stressful.

489
00:22:04.148 --> 00:22:07.369
I mean. people will sweat enough
on their own. you know?

490
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.371
Hey. I... Wa...

491
00:22:14.245 --> 00:22:16.247
I feel like
I've let Ellie down.

492
00:22:16.378 --> 00:22:18.685
Losing the venue
is just a tiny roadblock.

493
00:22:18.815 --> 00:22:21.514
If I know you. this wedding's
gonna go off without a hitch.

494
00:22:21.644 --> 00:22:24.038
Yeah. maybe you're right.

495
00:22:24.168 --> 00:22:25.692
only now
I have a lot of people to call

496
00:22:25.822 --> 00:22:27.346
and let know
the new venue address.

497
00:22:27.476 --> 00:22:30.479
Well. maybe I can help.
Take the reigns somewhere.

498
00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:32.220
Ah. we'll see.

499
00:22:36.398 --> 00:22:37.356
[Meg sighs]

500
00:22:38.922 --> 00:22:43.057
Okay. so the rental fiasco

501
00:22:43.187 --> 00:22:46.365
set us back about 41 minutes.

502
00:22:46.495 --> 00:22:48.715
Thankfully. that only
cut into our unpacking time.

503
00:22:48.845 --> 00:22:50.630
Your mom and dad
should be here any minute now.

504
00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.153
and Lauren within the hour.

505
00:22:52.283 --> 00:22:53.894
Oh. and I called everyone
on the guest list

506
00:22:54.024 --> 00:22:56.766
and let them know the new
address. so crisis averted.

507
00:22:56.897 --> 00:23:00.074
[sighs] Well. thanks to Tyler
having that bright idea.

508
00:23:00.204 --> 00:23:01.641
Oh. my gosh. I can't believe
I just said that.

509
00:23:01.771 --> 00:23:03.730
Ah. See? Maybe he's changed.

510
00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:07.560
Uh. no. One bright idea
does not make a changed man.

511
00:23:11.868 --> 00:23:15.785
[sighs] Well. maybe Sam will
stop driving me crazy. too.

512
00:23:22.488 --> 00:23:24.359
Hey. have you seen
a small jewelry pouch?

513
00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:26.535
I'm positive I packed it
on the side of my suitcase.

514
00:23:26.666 --> 00:23:28.668
No. I don't think so.

515
00:23:28.798 --> 00:23:31.018
That's strange.
It was just right here.

516
00:23:31.148 --> 00:23:32.802
Okay. well. can we look for it
a little bit later?

517
00:23:32.933 --> 00:23:34.804
Janine is about to be here
to finalize the cake order.

518
00:23:34.935 --> 00:23:36.632
No. we have to find it
right now. Meg.

519
00:23:36.763 --> 00:23:38.895
Yeah. well. maybe it just fell
out when you were in the car.

520
00:23:39.026 --> 00:23:40.810
-No. it's my something blue.
-Okay. well...

521
00:23:40.941 --> 00:23:42.638
It'll be easier to search when
we're not in such a time crunch.

522
00:23:42.769 --> 00:23:44.335
You don't understand.
It was my grandmother's.

523
00:23:44.466 --> 00:23:46.947
My mom will freak out
when she finds out it's gone.

524
00:23:47.077 --> 00:23:48.862
-[doorbell rings]
-[Ellie sighs]

525
00:23:48.992 --> 00:23:50.167
I will help you
search for it tonight.

526
00:23:50.298 --> 00:23:52.474
but now we gotta get going.

527
00:23:52.605 --> 00:23:54.955
Oh. b-but you're still gonna
wear it for the wedding. though.

528
00:23:55.085 --> 00:23:57.610
-We were in a rush. mom.
-And it's still being cleaned.

529
00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:00.874
Oh. You don't miss a beat. Meg.

530
00:24:01.004 --> 00:24:03.833
It feels like just yesterday
that I was watching you two

531
00:24:03.964 --> 00:24:08.708
play in the backyard. and now my
little girl is getting married.

532
00:24:08.838 --> 00:24:11.798
Mom. you say that
every time we're together.

533
00:24:11.928 --> 00:24:13.626
Well. your mother
still sees you as a toddler

534
00:24:13.756 --> 00:24:15.192
running around in the backyard.

535
00:24:15.323 --> 00:24:19.022
Well. I have to admit.
this place is pretty perfect.

536
00:24:19.153 --> 00:24:20.981
I'm not surprised. I'm sure
that Claire has been waiting

537
00:24:21.111 --> 00:24:23.636
her entire life for this moment.

538
00:24:23.766 --> 00:24:26.116
-[doorbell rings]
-I've got it!

539
00:24:26.247 --> 00:24:27.901
[gasps] Ooh. that should be
Janine with the cakes.

540
00:24:28.031 --> 00:24:29.163
[Meg chuckles]

541
00:24:32.688 --> 00:24:35.778
Oh. Meg. I'm so sorry. We have
a problem with the cakes.

542
00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:38.041
A problem? Like. what?

543
00:24:38.172 --> 00:24:42.959
-Like. there are no cakes.
-No cakes?

544
00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:44.831
[Janine] They didn't have our
cake order in their system--

545
00:24:44.961 --> 00:24:47.137
What are you talking about?
I-I put it online months ago!

546
00:24:47.268 --> 00:24:49.183
-I-I even have a receipt--
-I get there's a receipt.

547
00:24:49.313 --> 00:24:51.881
But that still doesn't mean
there's a cake.

548
00:24:52.012 --> 00:24:54.710
They're trying to work one in.
I told them to put a rush on it.

549
00:24:54.841 --> 00:24:56.756
A rush on it? Like. today?

550
00:24:56.886 --> 00:24:59.498
W-what if
we just made the cakes?

551
00:24:59.628 --> 00:25:02.196
Oh. no. no. no. no. no. Ellie
needs a proper bride's cake.

552
00:25:02.326 --> 00:25:05.329
These things happen.
It's fixable.

553
00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:08.028
Janine. call again. Just make
sure that we will have a cake.

554
00:25:08.158 --> 00:25:10.465
Okay. even two tiers
we will make do.

555
00:25:10.596 --> 00:25:13.947
And. Debbie. have you ever made
chocolate cake?

556
00:25:14.077 --> 00:25:16.036
Sam's cake is supposed to be
red velvet.

557
00:25:16.166 --> 00:25:17.472
Well. red velvet
is chocolate cake

558
00:25:17.603 --> 00:25:18.821
just with some food coloring.

559
00:25:18.952 --> 00:25:21.041
I can do that. It'll be yummy.

560
00:25:21.171 --> 00:25:23.652
You know. your mom makes
a pretty decent cake.

561
00:25:23.783 --> 00:25:24.827
-Thanks. Debs.
-[Debbie] Yeah. Oh.

562
00:25:24.958 --> 00:25:25.915
Claire. why don't we have a look

563
00:25:26.046 --> 00:25:27.395
at what you have
in your kitchen?

564
00:25:27.526 --> 00:25:29.615
Oh. I don't know
what we have in the kitchen.

565
00:25:29.745 --> 00:25:33.488
I don't cook. so my guess
is as good as yours.

566
00:25:33.619 --> 00:25:36.273
-But let's see.
-Hm. Okay.

567
00:25:36.404 --> 00:25:38.058
It's gonna be okay. honey.

568
00:25:40.321 --> 00:25:42.453
Look. everything's
gonna be fine.

569
00:25:42.584 --> 00:25:44.064
Is it? 'Cause I'm not convinced.

570
00:25:44.194 --> 00:25:46.066
Yeah. it will. I promise.

571
00:25:46.196 --> 00:25:48.764
Let's just go look and see where
your ceremony's gonna be. huh?

572
00:25:48.895 --> 00:25:50.070
[chuckles]

573
00:25:53.552 --> 00:25:56.816
Okay. so I was thinking
the arch goes here.

574
00:25:56.946 --> 00:26:01.124
and then the guests go here.
facing this way.

575
00:26:01.255 --> 00:26:04.345
-Uh. can we fit everyone?
-Yeah.

576
00:26:04.475 --> 00:26:07.000
Tightly. but. yes. I think so.

577
00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:09.089
[Debbie screaming]

578
00:26:09.219 --> 00:26:13.006
Oh. okay. look. Meg. I love
my mom. but she does this thing

579
00:26:13.136 --> 00:26:14.921
where she announces
everything she sees

580
00:26:15.051 --> 00:26:17.401
and narrates everything that's
going on as it's happening.

581
00:26:17.532 --> 00:26:20.274
Can you please
not let that happen?

582
00:26:20.404 --> 00:26:22.798
It drives me so crazy. Meg.
so crazy.

583
00:26:22.929 --> 00:26:26.889
[laughs] Look
at this beautiful garden!

584
00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:30.458
Oh. It's so peaceful and serene!

585
00:26:30.589 --> 00:26:32.373
The gardeners do a lovely job.
don't they?

586
00:26:32.503 --> 00:26:34.897
The ladies and I play bridge
out here sometimes. too.

587
00:26:35.028 --> 00:26:37.073
Oh. wow. I can just see Ellie

588
00:26:37.204 --> 00:26:39.119
walking in
from right over there.

589
00:26:39.249 --> 00:26:41.121
-Yes. hon. Very cute.
-[laughs]

590
00:26:41.251 --> 00:26:43.602
And look at this
for the seating area.

591
00:26:43.732 --> 00:26:47.649
it's just so tiny
and adorable.

592
00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:49.608
Oh. we'll sit right there.

593
00:26:49.738 --> 00:26:51.740
-Yay!
-[Debbie laughs]

594
00:26:51.871 --> 00:26:53.133
Oh...

595
00:26:56.266 --> 00:26:57.572
Play ball.

596
00:26:57.703 --> 00:26:59.487
-There you guys are!
-Whoa!

597
00:26:59.618 --> 00:27:02.708
-Hey! It's so good to see you.
-Hi. Greg. how are you doing?

598
00:27:02.838 --> 00:27:03.970
-Hi. Greg.
-Good to see you.

599
00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:05.101
-Meg.
-Where have you two been?

600
00:27:05.232 --> 00:27:06.537
Just deciding on wedding stuff

601
00:27:06.668 --> 00:27:07.974
because I didn't know
where you were.

602
00:27:08.104 --> 00:27:09.889
We're always out here.
you know that.

603
00:27:10.019 --> 00:27:11.325
I'm sorry.
it's just with my parents

604
00:27:11.455 --> 00:27:12.718
and your mom.
it's a lot to handle.

605
00:27:12.848 --> 00:27:15.895
Well. I hope
at least the cakes arrived.

606
00:27:16.025 --> 00:27:17.723
Do you need a new caterer?

607
00:27:17.853 --> 00:27:19.768
'Cause I know
the best brisket guy

608
00:27:19.899 --> 00:27:21.465
in all of Southern California.

609
00:27:21.596 --> 00:27:23.337
[chuckles]
No. thanks. we're good.

610
00:27:23.467 --> 00:27:25.165
You know everything's
gonna be okay. right?

611
00:27:25.295 --> 00:27:26.775
I know. It's just still
a lot to do.

612
00:27:26.906 --> 00:27:28.690
Well. do you need our help?

613
00:27:28.821 --> 00:27:30.518
No. we just have
a few kinks to work out.

614
00:27:30.649 --> 00:27:33.303
-Are you sure?
-Yeah. we'll be fine.

615
00:27:33.434 --> 00:27:34.957
You just go work on your vows.

616
00:27:35.088 --> 00:27:36.524
And then in just three days

617
00:27:36.655 --> 00:27:38.657
I get to marry
the love of my life.

618
00:27:38.787 --> 00:27:40.354
Aww...

619
00:27:41.877 --> 00:27:44.706
[instrumental music]

620
00:27:47.927 --> 00:27:49.798
Did you double-check the car?

621
00:27:49.929 --> 00:27:52.018
I don't know if I could do this.

622
00:27:52.148 --> 00:27:54.498
Why not?
Did I. did I lock it again?

623
00:27:54.629 --> 00:27:57.284
I mean. go through
with the wedding.

624
00:27:57.414 --> 00:27:59.939
El. that seems a tad extreme.

625
00:28:00.069 --> 00:28:01.157
Oh. my gosh.
are you being serious?

626
00:28:01.288 --> 00:28:03.377
Does it look like I'm joking?

627
00:28:03.507 --> 00:28:05.509
Maybe it's just the-the
pre-wedding jitters. I mean.

628
00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.729
you said earlier that maybe
you were experiencing them.

629
00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:11.341
It's just. nothing is going
right. Maybe it's a sign?

630
00:28:11.472 --> 00:28:14.867
This whole thing. it just.
it doesn't feel okay.

631
00:28:14.997 --> 00:28:19.262
-Ellie. just try to breathe.
-Maybe we're not meant to be.

632
00:28:19.393 --> 00:28:21.047
You and Sam are perfect
for each other.

633
00:28:21.177 --> 00:28:23.527
You guys were made
to be together.

634
00:28:23.658 --> 00:28:26.052
So why am I struggling
with the vows so hard?

635
00:28:26.182 --> 00:28:27.488
Writing your own is a struggle.

636
00:28:27.618 --> 00:28:29.882
I mean.
you're practically condensing

637
00:28:30.012 --> 00:28:32.362
your entire love story
into just a few words.

638
00:28:32.493 --> 00:28:33.886
Okay. but what about
everything else?

639
00:28:34.016 --> 00:28:35.670
The chalet.
the bracelet. the cake.

640
00:28:35.801 --> 00:28:38.499
It's like life is telling me
it's not the right time.

641
00:28:38.629 --> 00:28:40.153
So then what do you wanna do?

642
00:28:40.283 --> 00:28:42.808
Maybe take a walk out back.

643
00:28:42.938 --> 00:28:45.332
-Think things over.
-That's a good idea.

644
00:28:45.462 --> 00:28:46.768
But I do appreciate this

645
00:28:46.899 --> 00:28:48.727
beautiful wedding
you've planned for me.

646
00:28:48.857 --> 00:28:50.903
Of course.
What are best friends for?

647
00:28:51.033 --> 00:28:52.992
I'd feel awful
if we called it off.

648
00:28:53.122 --> 00:28:55.951
No. you just focus
on what's best for you. okay?

649
00:28:56.082 --> 00:28:57.736
[Lauren sneezing]

650
00:28:57.866 --> 00:29:00.913
Sounds like Lauren has arrived.

651
00:29:01.043 --> 00:29:02.871
Meg. she. she can't see me
like this.

652
00:29:03.002 --> 00:29:05.961
[sighs] Okay. you-you go. I'll.
I'll take care of Lauren. okay?

653
00:29:06.092 --> 00:29:07.746
Thank you.

654
00:29:10.836 --> 00:29:13.012
-Hey. How was the drive?
-[sneezes]

655
00:29:13.142 --> 00:29:16.363
-Ah.
-You okay?

656
00:29:16.493 --> 00:29:18.757
[sniffs] It's nature.
So I'm highly allergic.

657
00:29:18.887 --> 00:29:21.411
Oh. no.
We have flowers everywhere.

658
00:29:21.542 --> 00:29:24.023
Whatever happened to the chalet?

659
00:29:24.153 --> 00:29:26.155
I was really looking forward
to the sauna.

660
00:29:26.286 --> 00:29:29.202
It was just
a terrible mix-up is all.

661
00:29:29.332 --> 00:29:31.334
[Lauren] You really should
let me help with the planning.

662
00:29:31.465 --> 00:29:33.554
You always bite off
more than you can chew.

663
00:29:33.684 --> 00:29:35.469
It was an issue with the agency.

664
00:29:35.599 --> 00:29:39.255
Hm. I was dreaming
about that sauna.

665
00:29:39.386 --> 00:29:40.735
It's really good
for head congestion.

666
00:29:40.866 --> 00:29:42.302
Why don't I show you
to your room?

667
00:29:42.432 --> 00:29:45.174
And you can freshen up
before we eat.

668
00:29:45.305 --> 00:29:47.133
-Where's Ellie. though?
-Yeah.

669
00:29:47.263 --> 00:29:48.699
I was. uh. wondering
the same thing.

670
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:51.006
We were gonna review our vows
before dinner.

671
00:29:51.137 --> 00:29:53.182
Meg. wh...

672
00:29:53.313 --> 00:29:56.969
Oh. you know. I think she just
stepped out for a second.

673
00:29:57.099 --> 00:29:59.580
[chuckles] That's so weird. I
thought she was right behind me.

674
00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:02.365
[sneezes]

675
00:30:02.496 --> 00:30:05.804
So is anybody else hungry?
'Cause I'm starving.

676
00:30:05.934 --> 00:30:07.893
-Where's dinner again?
-In town in two hours.

677
00:30:08.023 --> 00:30:10.809
But if you're hungry now.
we have peanut butter and jelly

678
00:30:10.939 --> 00:30:12.593
in the kitchen.

679
00:30:12.723 --> 00:30:14.900
Sorry. caterer comes tomorrow.

680
00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:16.379
He'll make food
for the entire weekend.

681
00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:19.513
[instrumental music]

682
00:30:34.223 --> 00:30:38.010
Mm. Your peanut butter and jelly
was a huge hit with Greg.

683
00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:39.620
He asked if you could do more
for the wedding.

684
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:42.492
-Mm.
-Mm.

685
00:30:42.623 --> 00:30:44.625
It's getting chaotic in there.

686
00:30:44.755 --> 00:30:46.583
Greg and Walter are fighting
over the last half sandwich

687
00:30:46.714 --> 00:30:50.109
and Debbie put on a movie.
but just keeps spoiling it.

688
00:30:50.239 --> 00:30:54.156
[chuckles] Yeah. well.
it's gonna be a full house

689
00:30:54.287 --> 00:30:56.376
all weekend. I'm afraid.

690
00:30:56.506 --> 00:30:58.639
Yup.

691
00:30:58.769 --> 00:31:00.815
This was a really nice idea
that you had though.

692
00:31:00.946 --> 00:31:03.862
so thank you.

693
00:31:03.992 --> 00:31:05.994
Yeah. It's a gorgeous place
for a wedding.

694
00:31:06.125 --> 00:31:07.213
Yeah.

695
00:31:09.389 --> 00:31:10.694
How are you doing?

696
00:31:12.131 --> 00:31:14.263
[sighs] I don't know.

697
00:31:15.656 --> 00:31:18.746
I'm kind of worried.
to be honest.

698
00:31:18.877 --> 00:31:21.705
I think you were right
about Sam and Ellie.

699
00:31:21.836 --> 00:31:24.317
She's having second thoughts.
and I'm afraid

700
00:31:24.447 --> 00:31:25.666
she's gonna call off
the wedding.

701
00:31:25.796 --> 00:31:28.712
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

702
00:31:28.843 --> 00:31:31.541
-Sam would be crushed.
-Yeah. so would Ellie.

703
00:31:31.672 --> 00:31:33.630
But. I don't know. she's just
not dealing with everything

704
00:31:33.761 --> 00:31:36.068
that's coming at her too well.
and then she's hiding it

705
00:31:36.198 --> 00:31:39.854
from Sam. probably 'cause
she doesn't wanna burden him

706
00:31:39.985 --> 00:31:41.638
or have Claire step in.

707
00:31:41.769 --> 00:31:43.814
Is there anything I can do
to help?

708
00:31:43.945 --> 00:31:45.947
-Maybe talk to Sam?
-No. no. no. please.

709
00:31:46.078 --> 00:31:48.645
-You cannot say anything yet.
-Okay. okay.

710
00:31:48.776 --> 00:31:50.256
But I can't just sit back
and watch my best friend

711
00:31:50.386 --> 00:31:52.084
get blindsided either.

712
00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:59.265
I just. I don't know what to do
at this point beyond mitigation.

713
00:32:00.657 --> 00:32:02.877
I don't know.
maybe Ellie's right.

714
00:32:03.008 --> 00:32:05.793
All signs at this point
just point to a big disaster.

715
00:32:05.924 --> 00:32:07.490
The chalet rental
wasn't your fault.

716
00:32:07.621 --> 00:32:11.581
It doesn't matter.
Doesn't fix anything.

717
00:32:11.712 --> 00:32:13.670
And I don't think anything will.

718
00:32:13.801 --> 00:32:15.629
Ellie has never backed out
of anything.

719
00:32:15.759 --> 00:32:18.545
Hey. look. look what you've done
for Ellie so far.

720
00:32:18.675 --> 00:32:21.504
you know. putting
this whole thing together.

721
00:32:21.635 --> 00:32:26.292
She is very lucky
to have a friend like you. Okay?

722
00:32:26.422 --> 00:32:30.731
And if there's anyone I know
who can fix it. it's you.

723
00:32:30.861 --> 00:32:33.516
Miss Can Do.
Miss Meg Knows Best.

724
00:32:33.647 --> 00:32:35.431
I hated it
when you called me that.

725
00:32:35.562 --> 00:32:38.130
-Yeah. I know.
-[Meg sighs]

726
00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:39.392
Where is Ellie. anyway?

727
00:32:39.522 --> 00:32:42.873
-She took a walk out back.
-Huh.

728
00:32:43.004 --> 00:32:44.092
Well. maybe what she needs
to be doing

729
00:32:44.223 --> 00:32:46.138
is talking a walk down
memory lane.

730
00:32:46.268 --> 00:32:48.618
remembering why her and Sam
fell in love in the first place.

731
00:32:48.749 --> 00:32:50.620
That's it. That's it!

732
00:32:50.751 --> 00:32:52.709
I can't believe I'm gonna say
this. but you are a genius.

733
00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.450
Wait. wait. hold up.
What is it?

734
00:32:54.581 --> 00:32:56.235
That is what Ellie needs.

735
00:32:56.365 --> 00:32:58.802
To be reminded
the meaning of her marriage.

736
00:32:58.933 --> 00:33:01.109
Strip away all this
wedding stuff. and show them

737
00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.372
why they fell in love
in the first place.

738
00:33:03.503 --> 00:33:06.680
-I'm a genius.
-Oh. I regret saying that.

739
00:33:08.638 --> 00:33:11.337
So what is the plan of attack?

740
00:33:13.078 --> 00:33:14.209
I don't know.

741
00:33:16.081 --> 00:33:20.563
Maybe we need to recreate
their first date or something?

742
00:33:20.694 --> 00:33:24.480
Something that is special
to them. and their love story.

743
00:33:25.916 --> 00:33:28.223
What do you remember?

744
00:33:28.354 --> 00:33:31.705
I remember exactly
when Sam tried to take Ellie

745
00:33:31.835 --> 00:33:33.315
out for dinner
for their first date..

746
00:33:33.446 --> 00:33:35.796
Oh. he. he was a wreck.

747
00:33:35.926 --> 00:33:37.885
Was that the Philamena's fail?

748
00:33:38.016 --> 00:33:40.018
Yes. Philamena's.

749
00:33:40.148 --> 00:33:42.890
Oh. only the classiest Italian
restaurant just off campus.

750
00:33:43.021 --> 00:33:45.501
Oh. my mouth just waters
thinking about

751
00:33:45.632 --> 00:33:46.894
their homemade ravioli.

752
00:33:47.025 --> 00:33:50.419
Yup. and sadly.
there's no ravioli to be had

753
00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:52.813
as Sam didn't understand
the concept of a reservation.

754
00:33:52.943 --> 00:33:55.250
[chuckles] Right. nor did
he understand the concept

755
00:33:55.381 --> 00:33:58.427
of overcooking pasta when he
tried to make dinner for Ellie.

756
00:33:58.558 --> 00:34:00.212
but instead
set off the fire detectors.

757
00:34:00.342 --> 00:34:02.170
[laughs] Well. he gets
an A for effort.

758
00:34:02.301 --> 00:34:04.129
even if the meal was inedible.

759
00:34:04.259 --> 00:34:05.956
Yeah. he sure does.

760
00:34:06.087 --> 00:34:08.698
I remember Ellie called me
right after she had that date.

761
00:34:08.829 --> 00:34:10.787
She said it was the best pasta
she's ever had

762
00:34:10.918 --> 00:34:15.183
because it was made with nothing
but water. powder and laughter.

763
00:34:15.314 --> 00:34:18.186
-Classic Sam.
-[singsong] Classic.

764
00:34:18.317 --> 00:34:20.319
So what are we gonna do?

765
00:34:20.449 --> 00:34:24.018
We can't replicate
our old place. It was a dump.

766
00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:29.545
True. but I think a little
mac 'n' cheese throwback

767
00:34:29.676 --> 00:34:30.764
could be just the trick.

768
00:34:30.894 --> 00:34:33.114
Okay. then.
we're gonna have to get

769
00:34:33.245 --> 00:34:35.421
some lettuce. croutons
and dressing.

770
00:34:35.551 --> 00:34:38.076
Sam went a bit ambitious
with that side salad.

771
00:34:38.206 --> 00:34:42.080
Okay. so we can go
grocery shopping.

772
00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:44.473
we will get everyone out of
the house headed to that dinner.

773
00:34:44.604 --> 00:34:46.084
Tell Ellie and Sam to hang back

774
00:34:46.214 --> 00:34:48.738
for a little
fashionably-late entrance

775
00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:50.523
and then we'll set up
when everyone's gone.

776
00:34:50.653 --> 00:34:53.003
Sounds good. and if needed.

777
00:34:53.134 --> 00:34:55.528
I have a lot of tricks
up my sleeve.

778
00:34:55.658 --> 00:34:58.922
Okay. but let's try and stick
to the plan. okay?

779
00:34:59.053 --> 00:35:00.228
Okay.

780
00:35:03.144 --> 00:35:06.104
[instrumental music]

781
00:35:10.369 --> 00:35:13.633
-[sighs] There they are.
-Hey. are you okay?

782
00:35:13.763 --> 00:35:15.591
[sighs] It's just a little
migraine. I think.

783
00:35:15.722 --> 00:35:17.158
I'm probably just dehydrated.

784
00:35:17.289 --> 00:35:18.551
I'm sorry. honey.
that's terrible.

785
00:35:18.681 --> 00:35:20.466
I'll. um. I'll get you
some water. okay?

786
00:35:20.596 --> 00:35:21.945
Thank you.

787
00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:25.645
Okay. you go in.
get things started.

788
00:35:25.775 --> 00:35:28.082
I'll talk to Elle and make sure
everyone is out for dinner.

789
00:35:28.213 --> 00:35:30.693
Okay.

790
00:35:30.824 --> 00:35:34.436
Hey. you. How was your walk?
Are you feeling any better?

791
00:35:34.567 --> 00:35:36.873
Not feeling better.
I just got even more stressed

792
00:35:37.004 --> 00:35:39.267
and now Sam is upset with me
because he couldn't find me.

793
00:35:39.398 --> 00:35:41.530
so I just told him
I had a headache.

794
00:35:41.661 --> 00:35:43.271
But you don't have
a headache. do you?

795
00:35:43.402 --> 00:35:45.969
What else was I supposed to say?

796
00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:48.972
Meg. I keep pushing him away.

797
00:35:49.103 --> 00:35:51.932
It would crush him
if he found out

798
00:35:52.062 --> 00:35:55.022
I was having second thoughts.
but you can't tell anyone.

799
00:35:55.153 --> 00:35:57.024
My mom. his mother.
they would be devastated.

800
00:35:57.155 --> 00:35:59.809
Uh. you're fine. El.
I mean. who would I tell?

801
00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:02.508
At this point you're
the only person I can trust.

802
00:36:02.638 --> 00:36:05.815
Lauren is allergic to
everything. including secrets.

803
00:36:05.946 --> 00:36:07.991
And now I have to put a face
on for everyone and talk about

804
00:36:08.122 --> 00:36:10.516
how excited I am
for this dumb dinner.

805
00:36:10.646 --> 00:36:12.126
Nope. You don't have to do that.

806
00:36:12.257 --> 00:36:14.346
Why not?

807
00:36:14.476 --> 00:36:17.131
Let's just say
the wedding party's gonna have

808
00:36:17.262 --> 00:36:19.394
their own little dinner tonight.

809
00:36:19.525 --> 00:36:20.787
Tyler and I have
something special planned

810
00:36:20.917 --> 00:36:22.310
for the two of you.

811
00:36:22.441 --> 00:36:23.703
You and Tyler?

812
00:36:23.833 --> 00:36:25.444
Yeah. well.
we spent the afternoon together.

813
00:36:25.574 --> 00:36:27.881
Okay.
Nothing makes sense anymore.

814
00:36:28.011 --> 00:36:30.840
Just meet me at the den 7 p.m.

815
00:36:30.971 --> 00:36:33.191
That is
your new reservation time.

816
00:36:33.321 --> 00:36:34.235
Okay.

817
00:36:38.283 --> 00:36:41.590
I spoke to Greg and they're all
at dinner. so we are good to go.

818
00:36:41.721 --> 00:36:44.419
Perfect. so we have
about an hour to two

819
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:47.117
to make Ellie and Sam
fall back in love.

820
00:36:47.248 --> 00:36:50.599
How's that. uh. side salad
coming along?

821
00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:52.340
Oh!

822
00:36:52.471 --> 00:36:54.734
-Oh. you forgot?
-I am going. okay?

823
00:36:54.864 --> 00:36:56.083
Yup.

824
00:36:59.217 --> 00:37:02.655
Wow. That mac 'n' cheese
definitely looks overcooked now.

825
00:37:02.785 --> 00:37:04.918
Uh. how about
you mind your own business?

826
00:37:05.048 --> 00:37:08.008
You have one job. and here
you are. supervising mine.

827
00:37:08.138 --> 00:37:10.053
Well. that's because I couldn't
make bad mac 'n' cheese

828
00:37:10.184 --> 00:37:12.230
if I tried. so it fell on you.

829
00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:14.362
Mm-hmm.

830
00:37:14.493 --> 00:37:17.496
Also. my menus are adorable.

831
00:37:17.626 --> 00:37:19.193
What? When did you have time
to do that?

832
00:37:19.324 --> 00:37:21.108
Like. ten minutes ago.
I just used the same program

833
00:37:21.239 --> 00:37:22.762
I used
for Val's wedding invitations.

834
00:37:22.892 --> 00:37:25.373
Oh. it was easy.
The salad. right.

835
00:37:25.504 --> 00:37:27.419
Yeah. The. uh. dressing.

836
00:37:27.549 --> 00:37:29.247
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

837
00:37:31.771 --> 00:37:35.992
Wow! You need help and you need
salad for that dressing.

838
00:37:36.123 --> 00:37:39.387
-Uh. Sam is the chef. remember?
-Mm-hmm. Yeah. yeah. Good cover.

839
00:37:39.518 --> 00:37:40.997
It needs to be authentic.

840
00:37:42.564 --> 00:37:43.957
We just have to remind them
how compatible

841
00:37:44.087 --> 00:37:46.220
they are together. you know?
Like Sam.

842
00:37:46.351 --> 00:37:48.004
He hits a roadblock
and he keeps going.

843
00:37:48.135 --> 00:37:51.181
Ellie loves that about him. and
she finds his mistakes endearing

844
00:37:51.312 --> 00:37:53.271
and him to be funny.

845
00:37:53.401 --> 00:37:56.970
-He and I have that in common.
-Yeah. except. you're not funny.

846
00:37:59.581 --> 00:38:00.495
Okay.

847
00:38:02.149 --> 00:38:04.020
Here. let me give it a shot.

848
00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:09.635
Uh. okay.

849
00:38:09.765 --> 00:38:12.115
-I should go get Ellie.
-Yeah.

850
00:38:19.209 --> 00:38:22.430
-Nice apron.
-Why. thank you.

851
00:38:22.561 --> 00:38:25.477
And welcome to Philamena's.

852
00:38:25.607 --> 00:38:26.608
-Hey. you feelin' better?
-Yeah.

853
00:38:26.739 --> 00:38:28.349
Is your entire party present?

854
00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:31.047
I think so. yeah.

855
00:38:31.178 --> 00:38:32.440
And your name. sir?

856
00:38:32.571 --> 00:38:35.356
-I'm Sam...
-Sam?

857
00:38:37.619 --> 00:38:41.319
Hm. Could it be
under another name?

858
00:38:43.364 --> 00:38:45.061
-[whispers] Just go with it.
-Try Ellie.

859
00:38:45.192 --> 00:38:48.674
Ellie? Okay.

860
00:38:48.804 --> 00:38:52.242
Yeah. um. I'm not finding it
anywhere here.

861
00:38:52.373 --> 00:38:54.288
Are you sure
you made a reservation?

862
00:38:54.419 --> 00:38:57.465
[chuckles] Uh. maybe I forgot?

863
00:38:57.596 --> 00:38:58.858
It wouldn't be the first time.

864
00:38:58.988 --> 00:39:01.077
Hey. it was only
our first date.

865
00:39:01.208 --> 00:39:04.037
Yeah. I'm so sorry. but I can't
seat you here tonight.

866
00:39:04.167 --> 00:39:06.126
Guess you'll just have
to go home and whip something up

867
00:39:06.256 --> 00:39:07.432
in the kitchen.

868
00:39:07.562 --> 00:39:08.868
[chuckles]

869
00:39:10.826 --> 00:39:13.438
Our first date. You burned
your hand for me and everything.

870
00:39:13.568 --> 00:39:16.658
Yeah. that burn was painful.
Left a mark.

871
00:39:16.789 --> 00:39:18.443
You did a great job
playing it cool.

872
00:39:18.573 --> 00:39:21.184
Oh. I wanted to impress you.

873
00:39:21.315 --> 00:39:23.012
[Tyler] Dinner's coming
right up.

874
00:39:25.972 --> 00:39:28.409
[Meg gasps] Oh. no!

875
00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:32.108
You don't wanna set off
the fire detectors.

876
00:39:32.239 --> 00:39:33.545
[coughing]

877
00:39:36.896 --> 00:39:40.943
Ma'am. Sir.

878
00:39:41.074 --> 00:39:44.251
Nice job. That is almost
as disgusting as I remember it.

879
00:39:44.382 --> 00:39:46.427
[both] Bon appetit.

880
00:39:46.558 --> 00:39:47.820
[chuckles]

881
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:49.343
-[doorbell rings]
-Ooh!

882
00:39:49.474 --> 00:39:51.650
And this is the part
where Sam orders

883
00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:53.869
the yummy pepperoni pizza.

884
00:39:56.698 --> 00:39:57.612
Mm...

885
00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:01.399
Worked like a charm.

886
00:40:01.529 --> 00:40:02.922
Mm-hmm.

887
00:40:03.052 --> 00:40:06.099
"Mm-hmm?" The date.
It worked like a charm.

888
00:40:06.229 --> 00:40:08.841
Yeah. it was a...

889
00:40:08.971 --> 00:40:11.104
-It was a great idea. huh?
-Yeah.

890
00:40:11.234 --> 00:40:15.195
I'm so glad it worked. though.
I was kinda worried it wouldn't.

891
00:40:15.325 --> 00:40:18.894
But I might be able to pull off
this wedding after all.

892
00:40:19.025 --> 00:40:21.070
Wemight be able
to pull this off.

893
00:40:21.201 --> 00:40:24.117
Mm. if by we you mean me.
then. yes.

894
00:40:24.247 --> 00:40:26.206
You're just
a sufficient sidekick so far.

895
00:40:26.336 --> 00:40:27.599
-Oh. really?
-Mm-hmm.

896
00:40:27.729 --> 00:40:28.904
So I haven't helped inspire you

897
00:40:29.035 --> 00:40:30.602
in any of this?

898
00:40:30.732 --> 00:40:32.386
Nope.

899
00:40:32.517 --> 00:40:33.822
Can I get a muse credit?

900
00:40:35.041 --> 00:40:36.564
I'll think about it.

901
00:40:39.959 --> 00:40:41.743
Do you think
we're in the clear yet?

902
00:40:43.615 --> 00:40:46.356
Hard to tell. but it is nice
to see Ellie smile again.

903
00:40:46.487 --> 00:40:50.404
Yeah. They have
their perfect love story.

904
00:40:50.535 --> 00:40:52.885
Yeah. I wish I could find
what they have.

905
00:40:53.015 --> 00:40:54.190
Don't we all?

906
00:40:55.975 --> 00:40:58.847
Where did you even find
a fog machine?

907
00:40:58.978 --> 00:41:02.372
That was an incredibly random.
but. but very nice touch.

908
00:41:02.503 --> 00:41:05.201
I had it packed
in the back of my car.

909
00:41:05.332 --> 00:41:07.421
I thought it might be cool
to. you know. use it

910
00:41:07.552 --> 00:41:09.379
when the groomsmen walk out.
Like. pssh.

911
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:11.294
Oh. yeah.
That wasn't gonna happen.

912
00:41:11.425 --> 00:41:12.818
-No?
-Mm-mm.

913
00:41:12.948 --> 00:41:14.428
I'm glad it found some use.
though.

914
00:41:14.559 --> 00:41:17.475
Yeah. well. I do have
a few tricks up my sleeve.

915
00:41:18.824 --> 00:41:19.825
[cell phone beeps]

916
00:41:21.479 --> 00:41:24.046
[sighs] It's work.

917
00:41:24.177 --> 00:41:25.700
But it's not urgent.

918
00:41:29.487 --> 00:41:31.227
[Ellie]
Thanks again for dinner.

919
00:41:31.358 --> 00:41:33.882
That was actually really sweet
what you did.

920
00:41:34.013 --> 00:41:36.102
I could tell it meant a lot
to Sam. too.

921
00:41:36.232 --> 00:41:38.800
And it was nice seeing
you and Tyler getting along.

922
00:41:38.931 --> 00:41:40.541
Uh. yeah. don't be used to that.

923
00:41:40.672 --> 00:41:42.369
-[both chuckling]
-And don't mention it.

924
00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:44.632
I'm just so glad that you and
Sam are back to normal again.

925
00:41:44.763 --> 00:41:46.199
Yeah. Me. too.

926
00:41:46.329 --> 00:41:47.679
I mean. I saw the sparks flying

927
00:41:47.809 --> 00:41:48.984
between the two of you tonight.

928
00:41:49.115 --> 00:41:50.290
The problem is the wedding.

929
00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:52.640
It just. it doesn't feel real.

930
00:41:52.771 --> 00:41:54.903
I feel so overwhelmed.

931
00:41:55.034 --> 00:41:58.777
Well. I mean. you know.
it's normal to feel overwhelmed.

932
00:41:58.907 --> 00:42:00.648
Yeah. it's just. with all
these people coming here

933
00:42:00.779 --> 00:42:03.303
for this wedding. I just
don't wanna disappoint them.

934
00:42:03.433 --> 00:42:05.305
Well. I think
you just need to relax.

935
00:42:05.435 --> 00:42:08.047
And we can downsize if you're
still feeling overwhelmed.

936
00:42:08.177 --> 00:42:10.092
You can have a tiny wedding
if you want to.

937
00:42:10.223 --> 00:42:13.182
You don't have to have
Cinderella's big ball.

938
00:42:13.313 --> 00:42:15.663
I'm already doing one of those.
happy to forfeit the other.

939
00:42:15.794 --> 00:42:19.145
-So you think I should forfeit?
-No. that's not what I meant...

940
00:42:19.275 --> 00:42:22.975
I. I just meant. with Valerie's
wedding. I'm overwhelmed.

941
00:42:23.105 --> 00:42:26.892
so I get how you would be
overwhelmed. I...

942
00:42:27.022 --> 00:42:30.809
Look. trust me when I say

943
00:42:30.939 --> 00:42:32.550
there's no one else's wedding
in the world

944
00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:35.509
I would rather plan
than yours. okay?

945
00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:37.772
You're my best friend.
and I'd do anything for you.

946
00:42:37.903 --> 00:42:40.079
-I love you.
-I love you. too.

947
00:42:45.475 --> 00:42:48.783
Aww. look at our little Ellie.

948
00:42:48.914 --> 00:42:51.699
Baby of the group
and the first to get married?

949
00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:53.309
I thought for sure
it would be me.

950
00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:56.008
[Ellie and Lauren chuckling]

951
00:42:56.138 --> 00:42:59.489
And you. you aren't even close
to getting married.

952
00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:00.969
You need to put yourself
out there more.

953
00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:03.276
[Ellie] So what's the sitch
with you and Greg?

954
00:43:03.406 --> 00:43:07.715
[Lauren] Huh. Please. He is
married to the sports channel.

955
00:43:07.846 --> 00:43:11.806
-And who keeps texting you?
-Uh. Valerie Ford.

956
00:43:11.937 --> 00:43:15.462
Her wedding is becoming
quite the event.

957
00:43:15.593 --> 00:43:16.898
Details got leaked to the press.
so she wants

958
00:43:17.029 --> 00:43:18.204
to push up even further.

959
00:43:18.334 --> 00:43:19.988
Val Ford?

960
00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:23.470
I love her.

961
00:43:23.601 --> 00:43:26.429
How did you even end up
scoring her wedding?

962
00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:28.780
This is crazy.
What is she like...

963
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:30.651
More importantly. can I crash?

964
00:43:30.782 --> 00:43:33.436
[chuckles] Uh.
she's actually very nice.

965
00:43:33.567 --> 00:43:35.917
She just has a very unique
vision for her wedding.

966
00:43:36.048 --> 00:43:39.747
and it involves everything.
It's a nightmare.

967
00:43:39.878 --> 00:43:42.750
And. yes. she's invited so many
people that I seriously doubt

968
00:43:42.881 --> 00:43:44.143
she would notice you
stalking her.

969
00:43:44.273 --> 00:43:45.666
[chuckles]

970
00:43:45.797 --> 00:43:48.060
Well. I hope that she's gonna
have better luck

971
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:52.020
than this one. 'cause
this one's having problems.

972
00:43:52.151 --> 00:43:53.674
I mean. it's definitely the
biggest wedding that I've dealt

973
00:43:53.805 --> 00:43:56.242
with. but you know. I'm always
up for the challenge.

974
00:43:56.372 --> 00:43:59.332
Something tells me
that Val's is gonna be easier.

975
00:44:00.594 --> 00:44:03.205
[sneezes]
Hm.

976
00:44:04.467 --> 00:44:06.600
Oh. almost forgot.

977
00:44:06.731 --> 00:44:08.471
Ellie. oh. m-my nails are wet.

978
00:44:08.602 --> 00:44:11.605
but your mom gave me
picture charms at dinner.

979
00:44:11.736 --> 00:44:15.435
-Oh. perfect. Yeah.
-Oh. for your something old?

980
00:44:15.565 --> 00:44:18.046
Yeah. I'm wrapping small
pictures of my grandparents

981
00:44:18.177 --> 00:44:19.700
into the bouquet.

982
00:44:19.831 --> 00:44:22.137
Aww. I love that!

983
00:44:22.268 --> 00:44:24.574
Oh. and your mom. she gave me
her diamond earrings earlier

984
00:44:24.705 --> 00:44:27.752
today for your something
borrowed. Thanks. Debs.

985
00:44:27.882 --> 00:44:30.189
So that just leaves
your something blue.

986
00:44:30.319 --> 00:44:33.888
Yeah. that's supposed to be my
bracelet. but I can't find it.

987
00:44:34.019 --> 00:44:37.413
I've zero clue where it is. I've
ripped this whole house apart.

988
00:44:37.544 --> 00:44:38.632
[Lauren] You could have
left it at home.

989
00:44:38.763 --> 00:44:40.634
I triple checked.
It was in my bag.

990
00:44:40.765 --> 00:44:42.549
You mean.
that beaded blue bracelet?

991
00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:44.290
-[Ellie] Hm.
-Oh.

992
00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:45.987
-We'll find it. El.
-[Ellie] I hope so.

993
00:44:46.118 --> 00:44:48.816
'Cause I don't think
I can get married without it.

994
00:44:55.214 --> 00:44:59.609
I brought everything we had
in stock. Any of these match?

995
00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:01.524
They're all the blue ones
I could find.

996
00:45:01.655 --> 00:45:06.529
[sighs] Well.
this one is sort of similar.

997
00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:09.576
It's just Ellie thinks that
we're still gonna find hers.

998
00:45:09.707 --> 00:45:11.056
But I'm just gonna let her
believe it

999
00:45:11.186 --> 00:45:13.406
'cause she does not need
any more stress.

1000
00:45:13.536 --> 00:45:15.190
This is as close to the real
thing as we're gonna get.

1001
00:45:15.321 --> 00:45:17.453
-I think.
-Shall I have her try it on?

1002
00:45:17.584 --> 00:45:19.586
No. let's just pull it
and hold it here.

1003
00:45:19.717 --> 00:45:21.153
Thanks. Janine.

1004
00:45:21.283 --> 00:45:22.545
-Um. a little bit to the left.
-This way?

1005
00:45:22.676 --> 00:45:24.809
-No. the other left. That one.
-Oh.

1006
00:45:24.939 --> 00:45:28.943
A little bit. smidge.
No. too far. Okay. right there.

1007
00:45:29.074 --> 00:45:30.902
-Perfect.
-[Tyler] Fine.

1008
00:45:34.775 --> 00:45:37.909
I just still feel
really guilty. though.

1009
00:45:38.039 --> 00:45:40.389
Like. what if in the craze of
putting together Ellie's wedding

1010
00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:43.218
and Valerie's simultaneously
that I misplaced it somewhere?

1011
00:45:43.349 --> 00:45:44.829
So we'll keep looking for it.

1012
00:45:44.959 --> 00:45:47.135
You know. we're not gonna
give up hope yet.

1013
00:45:47.266 --> 00:45:49.311
Only we're officially way
behind schedule at this point.

1014
00:45:49.442 --> 00:45:51.923
So I'll drive back to the city
and look for it again.

1015
00:45:52.053 --> 00:45:54.099
No. weddings need to stay
on schedule.

1016
00:45:55.709 --> 00:45:58.146
That other bracelet
will have to do

1017
00:45:58.277 --> 00:46:00.932
even though
it's more clear than blue.

1018
00:46:01.062 --> 00:46:03.935
[sighs] Ellie is just gonna be
so upset if we can't find it.

1019
00:46:04.065 --> 00:46:05.980
I think we need to recreate
another date.

1020
00:46:06.111 --> 00:46:09.027
What? No. no. no. I thought
for sure we nailed that dinner.

1021
00:46:09.157 --> 00:46:13.422
Yeah. we did. but...

1022
00:46:13.553 --> 00:46:15.381
I talked to her last night
and I think she just needs

1023
00:46:15.511 --> 00:46:17.470
a little more reassurance.

1024
00:46:19.733 --> 00:46:21.691
Okay. what do you have in mind?

1025
00:46:21.822 --> 00:46:24.390
Three little words.

1026
00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:25.870
[laughs]

1027
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.872
Am I meant to be familiar
with those words?

1028
00:46:28.002 --> 00:46:30.875
You should be.

1029
00:46:31.005 --> 00:46:31.963
I love you.

1030
00:46:32.093 --> 00:46:36.141
Aww. I love you. too.

1031
00:46:36.271 --> 00:46:39.535
I'm talking about the first time
they said it to each other.

1032
00:46:39.666 --> 00:46:41.755
I will fill you in on
the details as soon as I'm done

1033
00:46:41.886 --> 00:46:43.148
making these calls for Val.

1034
00:46:43.278 --> 00:46:45.541
No. You can't leave me hanging.

1035
00:46:45.672 --> 00:46:47.761
Fine. I'll show you.

1036
00:46:47.892 --> 00:46:50.242
But all I can say now is
it's just gonna remind them

1037
00:46:50.372 --> 00:46:53.158
how much fun
they really have together.

1038
00:46:53.288 --> 00:46:55.290
Wow. you're just like
a walking live feed.

1039
00:46:55.421 --> 00:46:57.597
[sighs]
Val is on the verge again.

1040
00:46:57.727 --> 00:46:59.381
Verge of what?

1041
00:46:59.512 --> 00:47:01.601
I don't know.
an emotional breakdown?

1042
00:47:01.731 --> 00:47:04.082
Overjoyed with happiness?
It changes by the minute.

1043
00:47:04.212 --> 00:47:06.824
But she is always on the verge.
always.

1044
00:47:06.954 --> 00:47:10.218
Uh-huh. You sure you didn't bite
off more than you could chew?

1045
00:47:12.394 --> 00:47:14.614
-Help me with this.
-Say please.

1046
00:47:14.744 --> 00:47:17.965
-[Meg] Just do it.
-Okay.

1047
00:47:18.096 --> 00:47:21.490
Let me tell you something.
my multi-tasking talents.

1048
00:47:21.621 --> 00:47:23.753
they have no limitations
or thresholds.

1049
00:47:23.884 --> 00:47:26.147
-Oh? Is that right?
-Obviously.

1050
00:47:26.278 --> 00:47:29.759
Are you sure you're not gonna
look back some day and feel bad

1051
00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:33.111
for not giving yourself
entirely to your best friend?

1052
00:47:33.241 --> 00:47:35.200
[scoffs] Excuse me?

1053
00:47:35.330 --> 00:47:38.203
Why don't you just stick
to your baby steps rule of thumb

1054
00:47:38.333 --> 00:47:40.814
and leave the big stuff
to the big kids. okay?

1055
00:47:40.945 --> 00:47:42.729
[Tyler] Okay.

1056
00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:46.037
-[Tyler sighs]
-Perfect.

1057
00:47:46.167 --> 00:47:49.344
I am doing just fine
juggling both. obviously.

1058
00:47:49.475 --> 00:47:51.433
You know. you're not gonna be
able to pull out that phone

1059
00:47:51.564 --> 00:47:53.305
standing next to Ellie
at the altar.

1060
00:47:53.435 --> 00:47:55.002
I won't need to. I'll just
put it in her bouquet.

1061
00:47:55.133 --> 00:47:58.005
[chuckles] Okay.

1062
00:47:58.136 --> 00:47:59.615
So are you gonna show me

1063
00:47:59.746 --> 00:48:02.009
what the next
deep-down memory lane is?

1064
00:48:03.837 --> 00:48:05.273
Okay. let's go.

1065
00:48:11.845 --> 00:48:14.500
Yeah. that's not what
that's used for. Can we focus?

1066
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:16.502
Please?

1067
00:48:16.632 --> 00:48:17.895
-Thank you.
-Sure.

1068
00:48:20.201 --> 00:48:21.942
I can't even remember
the last time

1069
00:48:22.073 --> 00:48:26.599
I even went to a movie theater.
Feels like another lifetime.

1070
00:48:26.729 --> 00:48:29.602
I went the past weekend. Twice.

1071
00:48:29.732 --> 00:48:32.039
Wow. Must be nice
having such freedom.

1072
00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:34.868
Yeah. last time I checked.
it's a free country.

1073
00:48:34.999 --> 00:48:40.482
You know. the only person
tying you down is... you.

1074
00:48:40.613 --> 00:48:43.355
Wow. Thank you.
personal self-help guru.

1075
00:48:43.485 --> 00:48:45.705
[chuckles] Anytime.

1076
00:48:45.835 --> 00:48:49.143
Anyways. the movie theater
is where Sam and Ellie

1077
00:48:49.274 --> 00:48:51.754
first said "I love you"
to each other.

1078
00:48:51.885 --> 00:48:54.279
During the movie? Really?

1079
00:48:55.584 --> 00:48:58.326
-Sam never told me that.
-[Meg] Yeah.

1080
00:48:58.457 --> 00:49:02.113
Hm. I-I hope it wasn't during
the one of those stupid

1081
00:49:02.243 --> 00:49:04.898
true-crime shows
that he watches all the time.

1082
00:49:05.029 --> 00:49:07.814
No. no. no. it-it was sweet.
actually. It was a rom-com.

1083
00:49:07.945 --> 00:49:09.381
-A chick flick?
-Yeah.

1084
00:49:09.511 --> 00:49:12.123
Oh. Sam. Ooh.

1085
00:49:12.253 --> 00:49:14.560
He said he never went
to a chick flick with Ellie.

1086
00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:16.910
Oh. then he told you lies.

1087
00:49:17.041 --> 00:49:19.130
You know your-your friend Cliff?

1088
00:49:20.783 --> 00:49:22.133
-Cliff? Oh. yeah. yeah. yeah.
-Yeah.

1089
00:49:22.263 --> 00:49:23.917
We used to play
basketball together.

1090
00:49:24.048 --> 00:49:26.441
Right. well.
Cliff is the manager

1091
00:49:26.572 --> 00:49:29.488
at the Great Hills Theater.
they had this huge plan.

1092
00:49:29.618 --> 00:49:33.622
they were gonna sneak him in
late. have kettle corn and wine

1093
00:49:33.753 --> 00:49:38.062
and Ellie's favorite candy.
Uh...

1094
00:49:38.192 --> 00:49:41.630
He's kinda sweet. though.
Still gonna tease him for it.

1095
00:49:41.761 --> 00:49:43.806
Aha. but there's a twist.

1096
00:49:43.937 --> 00:49:45.939
They didn't even watch
the rom-com.

1097
00:49:46.070 --> 00:49:47.506
Ellie got sick.

1098
00:49:47.636 --> 00:49:53.033
so Sam set up his star projector
at home instead.

1099
00:49:55.209 --> 00:49:59.474
So he did weasel his way
out of the movie. Classic Sam.

1100
00:50:00.867 --> 00:50:02.564
[Lauren] It's true. though.

1101
00:50:04.827 --> 00:50:08.048
-Howdy.
-Hello.

1102
00:50:08.179 --> 00:50:12.270
Ms. Ellie and Mr. Sam.
we request your presence

1103
00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:14.489
this way
to the outdoor amphitheater.

1104
00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:17.753
Wait. why don't you request
our presence?

1105
00:50:17.884 --> 00:50:21.235
Uh. because you can't get
tickets to the show.

1106
00:50:22.323 --> 00:50:25.805
-Uh. what show?
-Hm.

1107
00:50:25.935 --> 00:50:30.418
The show
that we are about to show.

1108
00:50:30.549 --> 00:50:32.768
-[Sam chuckles]
-Well. how do we get tickets?

1109
00:50:32.899 --> 00:50:35.684
-You can't get tickets.
-[Greg] Why not?

1110
00:50:35.815 --> 00:50:38.383
Because

1111
00:50:38.513 --> 00:50:42.300
it is sold out.

1112
00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:43.518
-Mm-hmm.
-Sold out.

1113
00:50:43.649 --> 00:50:45.172
-[Lauren] Sold out?
-Yeah.

1114
00:50:45.303 --> 00:50:46.956
Well. then who else bought them?

1115
00:50:47.087 --> 00:50:51.396
It's a privately booked event.
I am so sorry.

1116
00:50:51.526 --> 00:50:53.659
Well. who booked?

1117
00:50:53.789 --> 00:50:57.184
Uh. the maid of honor

1118
00:50:57.315 --> 00:50:59.404
and the best man. of course.

1119
00:50:59.534 --> 00:51:01.754
[chuckles]
Bride and groom only. Let's go.

1120
00:51:05.627 --> 00:51:07.064
Just like college.

1121
00:51:07.194 --> 00:51:10.067
So I'm stuck with you
for two hours.

1122
00:51:10.197 --> 00:51:11.764
-[Greg] Ping-Pong?
-No.

1123
00:51:14.158 --> 00:51:16.943
-[chuckles]
-[gasps]

1124
00:51:17.074 --> 00:51:19.206
Wow! This is beautiful.
just like--

1125
00:51:19.337 --> 00:51:21.252
Oh. that date at Great Hills.

1126
00:51:22.775 --> 00:51:25.560
I like that nebula.
It's a nice nebula.

1127
00:51:25.691 --> 00:51:27.562
How do you know
what a nebula is?

1128
00:51:27.693 --> 00:51:29.303
Uh. I took an astronomy class

1129
00:51:29.434 --> 00:51:31.349
back in our Economics days.
all right?

1130
00:51:31.479 --> 00:51:34.787
Oh. and you actually
learned something? Shocker.

1131
00:51:34.917 --> 00:51:36.832
Guys. this is actually
really sweet.

1132
00:51:36.963 --> 00:51:38.747
Thank you so much.
I can't believe it.

1133
00:51:38.878 --> 00:51:41.315
It's nice to take a break from
the craziness of the wedding.

1134
00:51:41.446 --> 00:51:44.057
And revisit some of our most
special moments in our history.

1135
00:51:44.188 --> 00:51:47.234
But this isn't even
the best part yet.

1136
00:51:47.365 --> 00:51:52.196
I didn't forget you had
your very own concession stand.

1137
00:51:52.326 --> 00:51:55.155
Stars and snacks.
what more could you want?

1138
00:51:55.286 --> 00:51:57.288
-Go! Go!
-Come on!

1139
00:51:57.418 --> 00:51:58.767
[Tyler] Ready. set. go!

1140
00:52:04.817 --> 00:52:07.211
Sam. hello. I have a wedding
dress I have to fit into.

1141
00:52:07.341 --> 00:52:09.387
You're already two pounds
under your goal weight

1142
00:52:09.517 --> 00:52:11.345
for the wedding.
Haven't you suffered enough?

1143
00:52:11.476 --> 00:52:14.348
-You should eat.
-You remembered my goal weight.

1144
00:52:14.479 --> 00:52:17.569
I mean. you'd still be perfect
no matter how many pounds

1145
00:52:17.699 --> 00:52:20.789
you gain. but all bets are off
for the honeymoon.

1146
00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:24.663
Yes. Italy. Delicious pizza
and wine every day.

1147
00:52:24.793 --> 00:52:26.099
-I can't wait.
-I know.

1148
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:27.448
We're gonna be watching
the stars

1149
00:52:27.579 --> 00:52:29.798
from the beautiful field
in Tuscany.

1150
00:52:29.929 --> 00:52:32.758
only. this time for real.

1151
00:52:32.888 --> 00:52:34.281
-Hey.
-Hm?

1152
00:52:34.412 --> 00:52:35.369
Do you remember what happened

1153
00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:37.589
that night at the theater?

1154
00:52:37.719 --> 00:52:41.288
You told me you loved me.
I miss dates like this.

1155
00:52:41.419 --> 00:52:43.421
We should do this kinda thing
more often.

1156
00:52:43.551 --> 00:52:44.683
Yeah.

1157
00:52:49.818 --> 00:52:51.820
I think we scored.

1158
00:52:51.951 --> 00:52:55.781
-You hungry?
-Always.

1159
00:52:55.911 --> 00:52:59.306
Ice cream and kettle corn.
Oh. my favorite.

1160
00:53:00.786 --> 00:53:02.527
Yeah. I can tell.

1161
00:53:02.657 --> 00:53:04.137
Honestly.
I do kinda miss being 13

1162
00:53:04.268 --> 00:53:05.486
and just eating whatever I want.

1163
00:53:05.617 --> 00:53:09.316
I know. right?
Those were the days.

1164
00:53:09.447 --> 00:53:13.755
Can you imagine having
a gallon-sized slushy now?

1165
00:53:13.886 --> 00:53:16.062
-Oh! The sugar rush.
-Calories?

1166
00:53:16.193 --> 00:53:18.282
The painful.
permanent brain freeze.

1167
00:53:18.412 --> 00:53:19.674
-Oh.
-Oh!

1168
00:53:19.805 --> 00:53:22.155
You know.
they really have worked hard

1169
00:53:22.286 --> 00:53:24.201
to get where they are.

1170
00:53:24.331 --> 00:53:27.204
They've always made it so easy.

1171
00:53:27.334 --> 00:53:29.467
Uh. nothing is easy
when you're marrying the son

1172
00:53:29.597 --> 00:53:31.338
of Claire the control bear.

1173
00:53:31.469 --> 00:53:33.297
[laughs] True.

1174
00:53:33.427 --> 00:53:36.169
Yeah. but it must be nice
to have someone on your team.

1175
00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:38.954
Yeah. They do make
great teammates.

1176
00:53:39.085 --> 00:53:41.348
Sam makes Ellie feel like
she can be young forever

1177
00:53:41.479 --> 00:53:43.002
and she knows
that he is definitely

1178
00:53:43.132 --> 00:53:44.438
gonna be a great dad someday.

1179
00:53:44.569 --> 00:53:47.746
Right. And kids love Sam.
no doubt.

1180
00:53:47.876 --> 00:53:49.356
They're gonna make great parents
someday.

1181
00:53:49.487 --> 00:53:50.618
Yeah.

1182
00:53:52.577 --> 00:53:53.795
Hm.

1183
00:53:56.494 --> 00:54:00.149
Uh. whoa. whoa. whoa!
What are you doing?

1184
00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:03.022
You're gonna ruin
a perfectly good hot dog

1185
00:54:03.152 --> 00:54:04.241
that only needs mustard.

1186
00:54:04.371 --> 00:54:06.634
Uh. but ketchup
goes on everything.

1187
00:54:06.765 --> 00:54:08.070
Uh. ketchup does not go
on everything.

1188
00:54:08.201 --> 00:54:10.029
Ketchup does not go
on a hot dog.

1189
00:54:10.159 --> 00:54:14.599
-Mustard goes on a dog.
-Says who?

1190
00:54:14.729 --> 00:54:17.079
Says the National Hot Dog
And Sausage Council.

1191
00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:20.866
Oh. made up of. uh. you and you?

1192
00:54:20.996 --> 00:54:23.738
Yeah. Me. Try it.

1193
00:54:23.869 --> 00:54:26.524
Uh. no. thank you.
Mr. Councilman.

1194
00:54:26.654 --> 00:54:28.221
Jeez. next thing I know
you're gonna be forcing

1195
00:54:28.352 --> 00:54:29.788
your little kettle corn
inside my Ben And Jerry's.

1196
00:54:29.918 --> 00:54:32.007
Only if you knew
what was good for you.

1197
00:54:32.138 --> 00:54:34.009
Hey. I'm just trying
to help you.

1198
00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:37.970
I'm from Chicago. and we take
our dogs very seriously.

1199
00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:39.841
Wait. you're from Chicago?

1200
00:54:39.972 --> 00:54:41.626
I just thought you moved there
after school.

1201
00:54:41.756 --> 00:54:43.671
It's an easy detail to miss.
I'm sure

1202
00:54:43.802 --> 00:54:46.457
we weren't exactly
tight friends.

1203
00:54:46.587 --> 00:54:47.806
Yeah.

1204
00:54:50.243 --> 00:54:55.161
Okay. maybe I shouldn't have
been so hard on you back then.

1205
00:54:55.292 --> 00:54:57.337
I just like
to take over projects

1206
00:54:57.468 --> 00:55:00.601
and I expect everyone to be
on the same page as me.

1207
00:55:00.732 --> 00:55:03.387
And I could've

1208
00:55:03.517 --> 00:55:06.999
probably. maybe.

1209
00:55:07.129 --> 00:55:10.045
s-sort of

1210
00:55:10.176 --> 00:55:12.700
been more of a team player.

1211
00:55:12.831 --> 00:55:17.270
Wow. I'm sure that was
really hard for you to say that.

1212
00:55:17.401 --> 00:55:19.664
But you still admitted
you were wrong.

1213
00:55:19.794 --> 00:55:22.057
I did not admit it. I just said

1214
00:55:22.188 --> 00:55:24.059
that I could've been

1215
00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:28.760
more a team player.

1216
00:55:28.890 --> 00:55:32.111
Okay. sure. I probably needed
the push most of the time.

1217
00:55:32.241 --> 00:55:34.809
-See? Exactly.
-What?

1218
00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:36.115
-You heard me.
-Nope.

1219
00:55:36.245 --> 00:55:39.640
Fine. I'll try your mustard.

1220
00:55:39.771 --> 00:55:40.859
Okay.

1221
00:55:55.221 --> 00:55:57.266
-Hm.
-Hm.

1222
00:55:57.397 --> 00:56:00.487
Okay.
Good call. Mr. Councilman.

1223
00:56:00.618 --> 00:56:03.447
I'm not saying I'm wrong
about the ketchup. though.

1224
00:56:03.577 --> 00:56:06.754
This is just a compromise.
nothing more.

1225
00:56:06.885 --> 00:56:10.541
Speaking of compromise.
I might have to adopt

1226
00:56:10.671 --> 00:56:13.848
the West Coast ways
of using ketchup on my hot dog

1227
00:56:13.979 --> 00:56:15.110
fairly soon myself.

1228
00:56:15.241 --> 00:56:16.808
Why do you say that?

1229
00:56:16.938 --> 00:56:19.419
I have a job offer out here.

1230
00:56:19.550 --> 00:56:22.379
It's a huge career shift. but
I think it's a good opportunity

1231
00:56:22.509 --> 00:56:25.120
to move
into broadcasting. though.

1232
00:56:25.251 --> 00:56:26.774
Yeah. I might have to. uh.

1233
00:56:26.905 --> 00:56:29.255
say goodbye to the Windy City
after all.

1234
00:56:31.736 --> 00:56:33.651
Uh. do Sam and Ellie know?

1235
00:56:33.781 --> 00:56:37.132
I haven't told Sam yet.
but I haven't made up my mind.

1236
00:56:37.263 --> 00:56:40.353
Well. your secret
will be safe with me.

1237
00:56:40.484 --> 00:56:43.661
-When will you know?
-A week or so after the wedding.

1238
00:56:43.791 --> 00:56:48.100
I need to decide if I'm gonna
sign on the dotted line or not.

1239
00:56:51.625 --> 00:56:53.410
-Oh. they're coming.
-Oh.

-Ellie got hungry again. so...
-[Tyler] Oh. sure.

1241
00:56:59.677 --> 00:57:03.115
-[Meg] Please. help yourself.
-[Tyler laughs]

1242
00:57:03.245 --> 00:57:05.030
-We're just the help.
-So...

What were you two whispering
all quiet over here?

1244
00:57:07.946 --> 00:57:11.036
-Nothing.
-Okay. well. uh. we...

1245
00:57:11.166 --> 00:57:12.646
We just wanted to thank you

and getting along

Wait. Our differences?

1249
00:57:17.738 --> 00:57:21.786
Meg said you guys couldn't
stand each other back in school.

1250
00:57:21.916 --> 00:57:24.571
Uh. people have
their differences sometimes.

1251
00:57:24.702 --> 00:57:27.139
I mean. who even says
we're getting along?

his mustard-made agenda

onto my hot dog.

And you compared him
to bad sushi.

1255

-I didn't! That wasn't me.
-[Sam] Okay. whatever.

1256
00:57:37.932 --> 00:57:40.413
Um. we're actually gonna
go work on our vows.

1257

still hasn't finished hers.

1258

[Ellie] Yeah.
they're a work in progress.

1259
00:57:44.243 --> 00:57:46.114
Probably too much
wedding excitement. right?

1260
00:57:46.245 --> 00:57:49.640
Yeah. but at least they kept mom
and Claire at the shops all day.

1261
00:57:49.770 --> 00:57:51.816
Yes. Yes.
Thank you for that. too.

-It was taken out of context.
-Mm-hmm.

Yeah. I bet you don't even
put wasabi in your soy sauce.

01:01:56.321 --> 01:01:59.498
and maid of honor. Meg. for
everything she's contributed

1340
01:01:59.628 --> 01:02:01.587
to-to make this
an unforgettable wedding.

1341
01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:05.460
She's always been there for me.

1342
01:02:05.591 --> 01:02:09.377
although. I don't know
where she is right now.

1343
01:02:09.508 --> 01:02:13.120
Well. uh. that's really it.
Enjoy.

1344
01:02:14.426 --> 01:02:16.558
And cheers to that.

1345
01:02:16.689 --> 01:02:20.040
-[Debbie] Cheers.
-Cheers.

1346
01:02:20.171 --> 01:02:21.912
-[Tyler] Cheers.
-[indistinct chatter]

1347
01:02:24.871 --> 01:02:29.484
Hey. You feelin' all right?
You. you did amazing up there.

1348
01:02:29.615 --> 01:02:31.835
I. I just feel sick.

1349
01:02:31.965 --> 01:02:34.881
No. I-I've got this. Grace.
I-I promise.

1350
01:02:35.012 --> 01:02:38.319
-Yes. Mm-hmm.
-[footsteps approaching]

1351
01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:39.756
Yeah.

1352
01:02:40.713 --> 01:02:41.758
Okay.

1353
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:47.764
Sorry. that was work. again.

1354
01:02:47.894 --> 01:02:49.374
You missed the end
of Ellie's speech.

1355
01:02:49.504 --> 01:02:51.463
Oh. I'm sure she was great.

1356
01:02:51.593 --> 01:02:53.117
Yeah. Yeah. she was.

1357
01:02:53.247 --> 01:02:55.641
She thanked you. You were gone.

1358
01:02:55.772 --> 01:02:57.730
[sighs]
Is she upset?

1359
01:02:57.861 --> 01:02:59.906
Not as much
as I would have been.

1360
01:03:00.037 --> 01:03:01.429
And I thought we were gonna help

1361
01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:02.866
Ellie and Sam
make things better.

1362
01:03:02.996 --> 01:03:04.519
Ellie gets it. okay?

1363
01:03:04.650 --> 01:03:06.478
Look. I don't need
or expect you to understand

1364
01:03:06.608 --> 01:03:08.872
just how important this other
wedding opportunity is for me.

1365
01:03:09.002 --> 01:03:10.438
You didn't see
the look on her face when she

1366
01:03:10.569 --> 01:03:12.440
turned around and you were gone.

1367
01:03:12.571 --> 01:03:15.966
Yeah. you're gonna miss out
on some really important moments

1368
01:03:16.096 --> 01:03:17.271
if you don't shift
your priorities

1369
01:03:17.402 --> 01:03:18.882
for the people you love.

1370
01:03:19.012 --> 01:03:22.189
Wait. suddenly
you're Mr. Responsible?

1371
01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:24.148
Meg. you were working
on someone else's wedding

1372
01:03:24.278 --> 01:03:27.194
during your best friend's
speech. About you.

1373
01:03:27.325 --> 01:03:30.241
Because that was my boss
getting on to me about

1374
01:03:30.371 --> 01:03:32.286
neglecting this other wedding
all day

1375
01:03:32.417 --> 01:03:34.811
just so I could make today
perfect for Ellie.

1376
01:03:34.941 --> 01:03:36.813
And if it wasn't for all
the hard work that I put in

1377
01:03:36.943 --> 01:03:38.466
for her today.
she probably would've

1378
01:03:38.597 --> 01:03:40.120
called off the wedding by now.

1379
01:03:40.251 --> 01:03:42.079
You know. Meg. you're.
you're just. you're the same

1380
01:03:42.209 --> 01:03:44.821
as you were in college.
you know. caring way more about

1381
01:03:44.951 --> 01:03:47.301
perfecting the work itself
than the actual people

1382
01:03:47.432 --> 01:03:49.042
you're working so hard
to please.

1383
01:03:49.173 --> 01:03:50.870
Excuse me?

1384
01:03:51.001 --> 01:03:52.916
You know. you are
the last person on Earth

1385
01:03:53.046 --> 01:03:55.570
to give advice
about work ethics.

1386
01:03:55.701 --> 01:03:58.095
You can't even hold down a job
that you excel in

1387
01:03:58.225 --> 01:03:59.966
because you're off
chasing the next great thing.

1388
01:04:00.097 --> 01:04:03.361
Well. maybe I was chasing
the next great thing...

1389
01:04:05.667 --> 01:04:09.193
but maybe that thing
isn't so great after all.

1390
01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:13.762
[instrumental music]

1391
01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:21.422
[door lock clicks]

1392
01:04:22.771 --> 01:04:24.251
[Meg] Hey. El?

1393
01:04:26.253 --> 01:04:27.559
[Meg sighs]

1394
01:04:31.171 --> 01:04:34.958
I am so sorry that I missed
the end of your speech.

1395
01:04:35.088 --> 01:04:37.525
Grace was practically
threatening my job

1396
01:04:37.656 --> 01:04:39.179
if I didn't answer right then.

1397
01:04:39.310 --> 01:04:40.920
How did it go?

1398
01:04:41.051 --> 01:04:44.315
[sighs] You missed it.
That's how it went.

1399
01:04:44.445 --> 01:04:47.927
It's fine. I know you have
couture dresses and carnivals

1400
01:04:48.058 --> 01:04:49.102
and petting zoos
you're dealing with--

1401
01:04:49.233 --> 01:04:52.584
No. I'm so sorry.

1402
01:04:52.714 --> 01:04:54.673
-I'm here now. okay?
-That was it.

1403
01:04:54.803 --> 01:04:56.283
That was the last sign I needed.

1404
01:04:56.414 --> 01:04:58.372
I said to myself.
"If one more thing happens..."

1405
01:04:58.503 --> 01:05:00.287
And that was it.
You weren't there.

1406
01:05:00.418 --> 01:05:02.028
What are you talking about?
I am here.

1407
01:05:02.159 --> 01:05:03.943
I've-I've always been
right here for you. Ellie.

1408
01:05:04.074 --> 01:05:07.251
You should have seen the look on
Claire's face. like. I'm a mess.

1409
01:05:07.381 --> 01:05:11.037
I'm sure you're just
imagining things. El.

1410
01:05:11.168 --> 01:05:15.912
Look. I know that things
haven't really made sense

1411
01:05:16.042 --> 01:05:20.220
or been as perfect
as your proposal was...

1412
01:05:23.049 --> 01:05:27.227
but tomorrow is going to be
the biggest day of your life.

1413
01:05:29.447 --> 01:05:31.884
Janine confirmed the cake
this afternoon.

1414
01:05:32.015 --> 01:05:34.060
she's picking it up tomorrow.

1415
01:05:34.191 --> 01:05:37.281
We found a replacement for
your something-blue bracelet.

1416
01:05:37.411 --> 01:05:39.674
and we did cut down
the guest list

1417
01:05:39.805 --> 01:05:42.503
by more than half.

1418
01:05:42.634 --> 01:05:46.290
And I. for one.
cannot wait to watch

1419
01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:49.684
my best friend
walk down the aisle.

1420
01:05:49.815 --> 01:05:52.992
If I can do it. Meg.

1421
01:05:53.123 --> 01:05:55.081
I just don't know anymore.

1422
01:05:55.212 --> 01:05:58.780
Hey.
Everything is gonna be okay.

1423
01:05:58.911 --> 01:06:01.740
I think you just need
a good night's sleep is all.

1424
01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:03.785
Everything will be better
tomorrow.

1425
01:06:03.916 --> 01:06:05.309
I hope so.

1426
01:06:09.530 --> 01:06:12.272
This looks great. um. let's
just do a few more wisteria

1427
01:06:12.403 --> 01:06:14.057
on each of the aisle-side
seatbacks. please.

1428
01:06:14.187 --> 01:06:16.885
-You got it.
-Thank you.

1429
01:06:17.016 --> 01:06:18.583
Meg. darling.
where can the photographer

1430
01:06:18.713 --> 01:06:19.845
set up out of the way?

1431
01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:22.108
Oh. yes. Hi.
Just right over there.

1432
01:06:22.239 --> 01:06:24.545
[cell phone ringing]

1433
01:06:25.459 --> 01:06:28.071
Grace. Hi.

1434
01:06:28.201 --> 01:06:32.118
No. I'm just waiting on
one last call from Gala Affairs

1435
01:06:32.249 --> 01:06:34.381
and then we are golden.

1436
01:06:34.512 --> 01:06:36.296
Yeah. no. the-the deposit's
already been paid.

1437
01:06:38.733 --> 01:06:40.692
Aww! You look so good!

1438
01:06:40.822 --> 01:06:42.215
Thank you.

1439
01:06:42.346 --> 01:06:44.391
Those allergy pills
finally kicked in.

1440
01:06:44.522 --> 01:06:49.135
-I'm golden.
-Good. Where's El?

1441
01:06:49.266 --> 01:06:50.615
I don't know.
I haven't seen her.

1442
01:06:50.745 --> 01:06:52.486
Claire was looking for her
earlier. too.

1443
01:06:52.617 --> 01:06:54.706
Hm. Wonder where she could be.

1444
01:06:54.836 --> 01:06:57.970
-[Sam] Meg! Meg!
-Yeah. I'm in here.

1445
01:06:58.101 --> 01:07:00.277
-W-what is it?
-It's Ellie.

1446
01:07:00.407 --> 01:07:03.454
-She called off the wedding.
-Wait. what?

1447
01:07:03.584 --> 01:07:05.543
-What exactly did she say?
-I have no idea.

1448
01:07:05.673 --> 01:07:08.067
E-everything's a blur after
she said the wedding was off.

1449
01:07:08.198 --> 01:07:10.722
I. I can't even feel my knees.
okay? I-I have no legs.

1450
01:07:10.852 --> 01:07:12.463
Okay. calm down.
I don't think she meant it.

1451
01:07:12.593 --> 01:07:14.508
She told her parents first.

1452
01:07:14.639 --> 01:07:16.380
Uh. Debbie's crying
in the kitchen

1453
01:07:16.510 --> 01:07:18.382
and. and Walter is crying
even harder.

1454
01:07:18.512 --> 01:07:20.166
Wait. why would she tell them
and not me?

1455
01:07:20.297 --> 01:07:22.212
She said she tried to.
last night.

1456
01:07:22.342 --> 01:07:23.648
-No. she didn't!
-Maybe she did.

1457
01:07:23.778 --> 01:07:25.389
And you just didn't listen.

1458
01:07:25.519 --> 01:07:28.827
You have selective hearing
sometimes. Meg. You know you do.

1459
01:07:28.957 --> 01:07:32.439
-So where's El right now?
-See? Selective hearing.

1460
01:07:32.570 --> 01:07:35.138
Uh. she went on a walk
out back. I-I think. I...

1461
01:07:35.268 --> 01:07:36.574
[Sam] Hey. she didn't wanna talk
to anyone.

1462
01:07:36.704 --> 01:07:39.707
I am not just anyone.
I'm her maid of honor.

1463
01:07:39.838 --> 01:07:43.320
-[Sam sighs]
-Breathe.

1464
01:07:43.450 --> 01:07:45.365
-[exhales sharply]
-Deep breath.

1465
01:07:46.584 --> 01:07:48.064
Ellie...

1466
01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:52.546
Oh. honey.

1467
01:07:52.677 --> 01:07:55.375
I need to be alone
right now. Meg.

1468
01:07:55.506 --> 01:07:57.247
Well. there's a lot of people
out front waiting for you.

1469
01:07:57.377 --> 01:07:59.249
so I don't really think
that's gonna happen.

1470
01:07:59.379 --> 01:08:01.120
So tell them to leave already.

1471
01:08:01.251 --> 01:08:02.600
Look. if you didn't want
this day to happen.

1472
01:08:02.730 --> 01:08:04.254
you would've canceled it
by now. don't you think?

1473
01:08:04.384 --> 01:08:05.864
I tried to. you wouldn't listen.

1474
01:08:05.994 --> 01:08:08.258
You're just so stubborn!

1475
01:08:08.388 --> 01:08:09.650
-El--
-Forget it. I...

1476
01:08:09.781 --> 01:08:12.305
-This day is ruined.
-Wait. come back!

1477
01:08:33.805 --> 01:08:36.808
[instrumental music]

1478
01:09:05.445 --> 01:09:06.664
[gasps]

1479
01:09:08.361 --> 01:09:11.147
[cell phone ringing]

1480
01:09:12.496 --> 01:09:13.758
Hi. Grace.

1481
01:09:13.888 --> 01:09:15.716
What's taking so long
to send the files?

1482
01:09:15.847 --> 01:09:17.805
I'm sorry. I told you
that I had my hands full

1483
01:09:17.936 --> 01:09:20.808
with another super-important
wedding today already.

1484
01:09:20.939 --> 01:09:23.594
Okay. but Valerie's wedding
is super important. too.

1485
01:09:23.724 --> 01:09:25.900
and she wants to know
the status of her llamas.

1486
01:09:26.031 --> 01:09:27.554
Well. you know. Beth can answer
all those questions.

1487
01:09:27.685 --> 01:09:30.122
She has access to all
of my emails as we discussed.

1488
01:09:30.253 --> 01:09:31.906
She wants to hear it
from you directly.

1489
01:09:32.037 --> 01:09:34.300
Well. I told her that I'm not
gonna be available today.

1490
01:09:34.431 --> 01:09:36.607
so she's just gonna
have to wait.

1491
01:09:36.737 --> 01:09:39.175
I have to go now. Grace.
I really am sorry.

1492
01:09:39.305 --> 01:09:41.002
But I kind of have
a wedding to save.

1493
01:09:41.133 --> 01:09:42.482
[Grace on phone] But. Meg. I...

1494
01:09:49.576 --> 01:09:52.492
So Claire and Deb
are stalling the guests

1495
01:09:52.623 --> 01:09:55.147
and Walter is about to speak.
so we have a little time.

1496
01:09:55.278 --> 01:09:57.410
but we do need to move fast.

1497
01:09:57.541 --> 01:09:58.846
Now. what are
some of the best memories

1498
01:09:58.977 --> 01:10:01.022
that you've shared with Ellie?

1499
01:10:01.153 --> 01:10:02.981
Everything's just blurred
right now.

1500
01:10:03.111 --> 01:10:06.027
Sam. think.
The clock is ticking.

1501
01:10:06.158 --> 01:10:09.553
Uh. we went bowling one time and
I-I tripped and broke a tooth.

1502
01:10:09.683 --> 01:10:13.513
No bodily injuries.
Think romantic.

1503
01:10:13.644 --> 01:10:16.081
Oh. what about that time
you guys went to that

that I used to work at--

1505
01:10:18.039 --> 01:10:20.825
No. Lauren. Bigger than dinner.

1506
01:10:20.955 --> 01:10:22.130
Didn't she surprise you
with football tickets when

1507
01:10:22.261 --> 01:10:23.306
you guys were visiting me
in New York?

1508
01:10:23.436 --> 01:10:26.047
No sports. either.

1509
01:10:26.178 --> 01:10:28.006
All right. well. I-I don't know
what to day. all right?

1510
01:10:28.136 --> 01:10:30.138
I-I can't even think straight.
My brain is fried.

1511
01:10:30.269 --> 01:10:33.490
Okay. well. Sam.
you need to think harder.

1512
01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:36.144
You know. we have to go big
or go home on this one.

1513
01:10:36.275 --> 01:10:38.756
Your life is counting on it.

1514
01:10:38.886 --> 01:10:41.454
I just want everything to be
like the perfect day. you know?

1515
01:10:41.585 --> 01:10:45.371
Like. like summer
our senior year.

1516
01:10:45.502 --> 01:10:48.505
Summer senior year. That's it.

1517
01:10:48.635 --> 01:10:51.943
A perfect summer day
just like we had on campus.

1518
01:10:53.466 --> 01:10:55.163
I know what we have to do.

1519
01:11:01.735 --> 01:11:02.736
Oh.

1520
01:11:04.651 --> 01:11:07.001
Not surprised to see you
by the food.

1521
01:11:07.132 --> 01:11:09.047
I am surprised
you don't have a phone.

1522
01:11:09.177 --> 01:11:11.789
That's fair.

1523
01:11:11.919 --> 01:11:14.748
Look. I wanted to apologize
about last night.

1524
01:11:14.879 --> 01:11:19.362
You were right. You have been
right a lot. actually.

1525
01:11:19.492 --> 01:11:21.799
Oh.

1526
01:11:21.929 --> 01:11:25.237
I put planning a flashy wedding
ahead of being there

1527
01:11:25.368 --> 01:11:28.196
for my best friend
when she needed me most.

1528
01:11:28.327 --> 01:11:29.894
And I pushed you away
when you were just trying

1529
01:11:30.024 --> 01:11:32.462
to get me to see that.

1530
01:11:32.592 --> 01:11:35.247
And if I'd listened to you. uh.

1531
01:11:35.378 --> 01:11:37.162
there'd probably
still be a wedding.

1532
01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:39.295
Yeah. well.
it's a bit late for that now.

1533
01:11:39.425 --> 01:11:42.167
A shame. though.
It would have been incredible.

1534
01:11:43.821 --> 01:11:46.824
Well. I still think
there's a chance.

1535
01:11:46.954 --> 01:11:49.000
only. I gotta admit
I kinda need your help.

1536
01:11:50.567 --> 01:11:53.439
Okay. I've needed your help
this whole time.

1537
01:11:55.920 --> 01:12:00.011
Got to admit. you inspire me.

1538
01:12:00.141 --> 01:12:02.883
-Oh?
-I wish I used it sooner.

1539
01:12:03.014 --> 01:12:06.844
[exhales] Okay. sure.
What do you have in mind?

1540
01:12:06.974 --> 01:12:09.325
Just recreating one last date.

1541
01:12:09.455 --> 01:12:11.283
-Okay. sure. I'm in.
-Great.

1542
01:12:11.414 --> 01:12:14.852
Because we are about
to recreate a hot summer day

1543
01:12:14.982 --> 01:12:18.246
just like we had on campus.
we need to hide this box.

1544
01:12:18.377 --> 01:12:19.857
I see.

1545
01:12:19.987 --> 01:12:23.339

on west campus.

1546

everything up?

You-you. you have nothing
to apologize for. okay? I...

Truth is. I shouldn't have
given you any doubts

about writing my vows
in the first place.

really was great with words.

to just one paragraph. you know?

01:18:52.771 --> 01:18:56.340
Every day I just know
that there's nowhere else

1620
01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:58.951
I'd rather be than with you.

1621
01:18:59.082 --> 01:19:01.824
That's all I wanted to say.
I just...

1622
01:19:01.954 --> 01:19:03.956
I just didn't know
how to make something so big

1623
01:19:04.087 --> 01:19:06.089
fit into something so small.
you know?

1624
01:19:06.219 --> 01:19:08.221
Not that the vows were small. I
just didn't have a lot of time.

1625
01:19:08.352 --> 01:19:12.051
No. I. I totally get it.
And I do need to apologize.

perfect for everyone else

reminded us.

01:19:22.322 --> 01:19:24.760
And now I know that perfect
is only what you make of it.

1631

because it's ours.
