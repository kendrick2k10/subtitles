and you're probably wondering why Meekah
and I are being chased by a T-Rex.

Well. let's start at the very beginning.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.800
[Meekah] Earlier that day…

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.160
Hey. hey. hey! It's me. Blippi.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.720
And me. Meekah.

84
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.960
And today we're here at T-Rex Ranch.

85
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.200
a really cool place
with tons of real dinosaurs!

-[both roar]
-[chuckles] Yeah!

87
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.360
Park Ranger Asher told us to get here
as quickly as we could.

88
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.760
because there's been a big dinosaur
emergency that he needs our help with.

89
00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:23.280
Well. what do you think it is. Meekah?

90
00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.120
Hmm. It definitely has something
to do with dinosaurs.

91
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.560
Oh. maybe he needs us to track
something down for the dinos.

92
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.760
-Oh yeah. Hmm.
-[dinosaur growling]

93
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.440
Whoa! Meekah. look!

94
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.640
A dinosaur. And it's huge!

95
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.080
I can't believe it!

96
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.800
No! A real spinosaurus!

97
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.600
It was the largest carnivore
to walk or crawl on earth.

98
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.040
Oh. it was about 50 feet long.

99
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.440
Whoa. that's really. really. really.
really. really. really long.

100
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.880
Do you think this is what
we're supposed to help with?

101
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.720
It doesn't look like it needs our help.

102
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.480
-Just enjoying the nice walk in the sun.
-[chuckles] Aw.

Am I glad you're here.

[both] Hi. Park Ranger Asher.

109
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.880
You haven't seen a T-Rex go by. have you?

110
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.920
I wish. Only a Spinosaurus.

111
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.880
Does the T-Rex need our help?
Was that the big emergency?

112
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.640
-We came as soon as we got your message.
-[dinosaur growling]

113
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.040
Did I say it was a big emergency?

114
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.360
Ha. I meant small. Like. dino-egg small.

115
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.120
[whispers] Okay.

116
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.760
Here's what really happened.

117
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.040
I took the dinosaurs and eggs
off the ranch

118
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.880
for a little fun adventure.

119
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.160
and I didn't mean to.

120
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.720
but I kinda lost some of the dino eggs
along the way.

121
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.840
-[both] Oh no!
-Lost eggs?

122
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.000
Yeah. Not my finest work.

123
00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.160
But then I thought.

124
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.240
maybe my friends Blippi and Meekah
can help me find the missing eggs.

125
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.880
Did you retrace your steps?

126
00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.160
That's something we do
when we lose something.

127
00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.640
-Great idea.
-[chuckles]

128

129
00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.280
Uh-oh. I'd better hurry.

130
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.320
I don't want mama T-Rex
noticing they're gone.

131
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.520
She's very protective of all the dino eggs
at T-Rex Ranch.

132
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.520
Okay. Blippi and I will retrace
those dino stomps.

133
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.800
Where exactly did you take them?

134
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.800
Here's a map of everywhere we went

135
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.360
and each egg that went missing
at each location.

136
00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.920
Oh. I see.

137
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.320
So we just need to read the map
and retrace your stomps.

138
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.600
and we'll find all the eggs missing
in each place.

139
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.560
Exactly.
Our first stop was this playground.

140
00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.080
[Blippi] Oh yeah. Well. there are a lot of
fun slides for a little egg to roll down.

141
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.440
Yeah. So make sure to check all of them.

142
00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.640
-Oh. check all the slides. If you insist.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.960
This is gonna be so much fun!

173
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:52.440
All we need to do is follow the map
and retrace their steps exactly!

174
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.520
You're right! Also. I packed my binoculars
in my jam pack.

175
00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.240
That way. we can take a closer look
at the location to find those eggs.

176
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.200
Good idea. Meekah.
Well. we'd better hop in. Come on!

177
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.640
-Whoo!
-[chuckles] Whoa. Here I go.

178
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.920
Ooh. watch your step.

179
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.120
Whoa! Whoa! [laughs]
And don't forget to buckle up.

180
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.640
-Yep. First things first. Safety first.
-Mm-hmm. [chuckles]

181
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.560
Blippi and Meekah. do you copy?

182
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.080
Yeah. Park Ranger Asher. we copy.

183
00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.400
[dinosaur roaring]

184
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.320
Please hurry. This mama T-Rex
does not look happy.

185
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.000
She's looking for those eggs.

186
00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.560
We need them back ASAP. before they hatch.

187
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.440
Park Ranger Asher. over and out.

188
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.559
I almost forgot!

189
00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.600
-We have less than an hour!
-Yeah. that's not a lot of time. but--

190
00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:39.600
[gasps] Oh. I have an idea.
I'll set a timer on my compass watch.

191
00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:42.760
-That way. it'll keep us on track.
-Okay. The countdown starts in…

192
00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.480
[both] Three. two. one!

193
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.840
Here we go! Whoo-hoo!

194
00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.080
[chuckles] Well. here we are.
I can't wait to go in.

195
00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.840
-Let's take off our shoes.
-Oh yeah.

196
00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.360
First things first.

197
00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.520
We want to play in our socks.

198
00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.240
One shoe. two shoes!

199
00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.720
And. Meekah.
we should probably take off our vests.

200
00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.480
We've already lost an egg.
We don't want to lose our tools.

201
00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.640
Yeah. Great thinking. Blippi.

202
00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.480
[chuckles] Whoa. Meekah.
look at these colorful horses!

203
00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.920
Yeah. This is so fun!

204
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.120
I wonder if the dinos have fun
spinning around too.

205
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.280
Wait. Meekah! The dino eggs!

206
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.200
I was having so much fun.
I completely forgot about the search.

207
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.280
Oh. you're right. Blippi.

208
00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.800
We have to find that egg.
The clock is ticking.

209
00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.960
Okay. We need to find

210
00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.920
this egg right here.

211
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.680
It has yellow shapes on it.

212
00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.520
Ooh! Will you help us find
the first yellow egg?

213
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.440
Ah. cool! Hurry. Meekah. We've gotta go!

214
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.560
[both exclaiming]

215
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.120
Egg number one. here we come!

216
00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.760
Let's go! Whoo!

217
00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.240
-Oh. Meekah! Look at what it is!
-Wow! A fire truck!

218
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.600
Whoa. Yeah. This fire truck looks
really. really fast!

219
00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.600
Yes. I like the bright-red color.
Just like an apple.

220
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.080
Yeah. And look.
This truck is the number 65.

221
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.920
-Oh. cool!
-Whoa. yeah.

222
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.200
That's so that they know
which fire truck is which.

223
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.240
Hey. you want to get inside
and go find those eggs?

224
00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.520
-Yeah. that's a great idea. Meekah.
-I'll drive.

225
00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.680
-Okay. Here we go.
-Whoo!

226
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.520
Oh. and. Meekah.
don't forget to buckle up.

227
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.400
Oh yeah. First things first. Safety first.

228
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.320
Yeah. And you want to wear a helmet too.

229
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.040
All right. Let's go!

230
00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.640
[imitating siren wailing]

231
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.520
-Firefighter Blippi!
-Whoa. this is so cool!

232
00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.080
Yeah. Whoa. I love being a firefighter.

233
00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.520
Do you like being a firefighter too?

234
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.920
Yeah. Firefighters are so brave.

235
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.800
-They are brave. And strong!
-Mm-hmm!

236
00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.360
[grunting]

237
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.400
Hey. friends. check out that tree.

238
00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.680
Oh. a tree? Ooh. maybe the egg's there.

239
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.480
Ooh. maybe in a nest.

240
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.480
Yeah. I see a bird. but no eggs.

241
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.520
No eggs. Okay. I'm turning right.

242
00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.840
My compass watch says to go south.

243
00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.360
[Blippi exclaiming]

244
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.520
You like to drive this fire truck
really fast. Meekah.

245
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.800
-I gotta go fast! It's a rescue mission!
-We're going so fast.

246
00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.720
Whoa. We'd better turn on the sirens.

247
00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.240
-[imitating siren wailing]
-Lost egg! Lost egg!

248
00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.320
[imitating siren wailing]
Lost egg! Lost egg!

249
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.000
Lost egg! [chuckles] Hmm.

250
00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.720
Wait. I see some stores.

251
00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:37.920
Maybe they're in there.

252
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.040
Oh yeah. I bet if we check inside.
we might find it.

253
00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.640
-Yes. Let's park this rescue vehicle.
-Mm-hmm.

254
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.720
Click. click!

255
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.760
Okay. Here we go.

256
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.680
-Whee!
-Whoo!

257
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.880
[chuckles] Come on!

258
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.720
Whoa! Meekah. maybe they went in here.

259
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.760
Ooh. a supermarket.

260
00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:58.040
-Maybe there are superheroes inside.
-Yeah!

261
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.720
-Super Blippi!
-And Super Meekah!

262
00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.560
[whoops. chuckles] Super fast!

263
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.600
-Super strong!
-And super smart.

264
00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.840
Yeah. Super duper!

265
00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.880
Our superhero here is silly.
But there are groceries.

266
00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.480
[gasps] Maybe the dinos stopped here
for a snack.

267
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.920
Oh. maybe they did.
Well. I definitely need a snack

268
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
-after all that firefighting.
-[laughing]

269
00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.720
-We should probably go inside.
-Let's go.

270
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.680
[Blippi chuckles] Whoa!

271
00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.520
Whoa. check it out!

272
00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.120
Wow!

273
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.560
-Mmm!
-So many healthy foods!

274
00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.080
-Mmm! Look at that.
-Mmm.

275
00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.320
-Whoa. [giggles]
-Let's see. We have bell peppers

276
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.240
-and…
-[gasps]

277
00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.400
…carrots.

278
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.360
-Yummy.
-And…

279
00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.640
-A pretzel? That's not a vegetable.
-A pretzel.

280
00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.840
No. And a pumpkin.

281
00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.280
Ooh. Pumpkins are spooky.

282
00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:51.200
[gasps] Ooh. you know who would love
these healthy fruits and vegetables?

283
00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.560
-Mmm?
-An herbivore.

284
00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.760
Oh yeah.
Herbivores love their leafy greens.

285
00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.520
-Mm-hmm.
-[both imitating chomping]

286
00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.560
And carnivores eat meat.

287
00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:05.920
Whoa. yeah. Hmm. It looks like
these are just fruits and vegetables.

288
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.720
Hey! They're my two favorite colors!

289
00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.160
[gasps] Yellow and purple!

290
00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.600
-Oh yeah. look. There's some corn…
-And an eggplant.

291
00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:15.880
[sobbing]

292
00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.600
Oh. don't cry. Blippi. It's just an onion.

293
00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.400
It's just an onion? I'm so happy.

294
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.800
-That's silly.
-Some grapes.

295
00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:25.920
And…

296
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.200
a banana.

297
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.760
You don't want to leave a peel around.
You might slip.

298
00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.200
Ooh not safe.

299
00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:34.000
-Hey. you want me to check you out?
-Yeah. that'd be great.

300
00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.640
I think with all these fruits
and vegetables.

301
00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.280
we can make a tasty dinner.

302
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.560
Okay. here.
We'll put all the vegetables down.

303
00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.280
-and then we'll keep adding them.
-Yeah. [chuckles]

304
00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.240
Meekah. they're going the wrong way!

305
00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.840
-Oh. wow!
-[exclaiming]

306
00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.280
There's so many! Whoa.

307
00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.400
Well. maybe we'll go grocery shopping
another time.

308
00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.360
-Do you have everything you need?
-Mmm. I think so.

309
00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.560
-[Meekah] "Dino food."
-[both] "Please take one."

310
00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.640
[Blippi] Okay.

311
00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.480
Oh. Well. one for you.

312
00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:04.560
Thank you.

313
00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:05.960
And one for me.

314
00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.480
Carnivores would really love this
because they eat meat.

315
00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.960
Well. how about I put these
in my backpack for later?

316
00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.440
Maybe we can feed a dino.

317
00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:14.920
Maybe a T-Rex.

318
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.360
[roars]

319
00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.200
-Okay. I'll put these in my backpack.
-Perfect.

320
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.680
Hmm. Well. I think I have
just about everything.

321
00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.760
Yes. You sure you need some eggs?

322
00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.920
[both] Eggs?

323
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.320
-[gasps]
-[both] Dino eggs!

324
00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.040
-We should continue our search.
-I completely forgot.

325
00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.960
Well. I don't see any dino eggs here.
so I think we need to keep moving on.

326
00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.240
-Let's go.
-Whoo-hoo! Whoo!

327
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.960
Wait. Meekah. I wonder
where we should look next.

328
00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.040
Uh…

329
00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.160
Oh. how about this doctor's office?

330
00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.280
Oh yeah. Look. It says "Mini Clinic."

331
00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.440
Oh. and look! There's a mini triceratops.

332
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.480
Aw. it's so cute!

333
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.760
Oh. that makes sense.
A mini dino for a mini clinic.

334
00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.200
I'd like to be a vet
and give him a checkup.

335
00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:04.000
Yeah. We'd better go inside and make sure
it's okay. Come on. [giggles]

336
00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.680
Aw! Look at him!

337
00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.160
This is one really cute triceratops.

338
00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.240
-Yeah. he looks nervous.
-Oh yeah.

339

and I lost all the eggs.

512
00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.280
Right. Mission: Egg search.
[gasps] On a time crunch!

513
00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.400
-Ready. Blippi?
-Ready!

514
00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:20.840
[chortles]

515
00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:21.920
Hurry back!

516
00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.920
So. Meekah. you know how to get there?

517
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.520
I know "egg-xactly" how to get there.

518
00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:31.360
Good one.

519
00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:38.680
Oh!

520
00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:41.960
This looks like a place where
we can use the tools in our vest.

521
00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.040
Yeah. And I have the Blippi mobile
parked away.

522
00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:47.880
-That means we can search and play!
-[both whooping]

523
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.240
[gasps] Hey. let's see which egg
we're looking for.

524
00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:55.880
Mm-hmm. Yeah. The egg
might not be in the lost-and-found.

525
00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.520
but will you help us look around?

526
00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.320
-Great!
-Oh. great!

527
00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.440
What color is this egg?

528
00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:02.840
[Meekah] Right here.

529
00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:06.720
[Blippi] Oh. it has stripes on it.
and it's the color green.

530
00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:10.800
Okay. green egg.
we're coming to take you back home.

531
00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.640
Oh!
Maybe the egg is playing hide-and-seek.

532
00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:17.040
Oh! Ready or not. here we come!

533
00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.400
Keep looking for that egg. Hmm.

534
00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.400
There we go.

535
00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.360
I don't see it anywhere yet.

536
00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.560
Do you?

537
00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.920
Hmm.

538
00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.160
[gasps] But you know what I do see?

539
00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.640
Check it out!

540
00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.160
[both] A dinosaur!

541
00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:37.240
You know. I love dinosaurs. but do you
know what I love more than dinosaurs?

542
00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.320
-What?
-Pretending to be dinosaurs!

543
00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.320
[both imitating dinosaurs growling]

544
00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.840
-I'm a T-Rex!
-Whoa!

545
00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:46.720
[screams. laughs]

546
00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.360
-[growling]
-So silly.

547
00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.840
-Oh. I have a great idea.
-Oh. what's that?

548
00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:54.040
-Let's play a game of charades.
-Whoa. I love charades.

549
00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:56.560
Yeah. That's where one person
acts something out.

550
00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.560
and the other person guesses.

551
00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.840
Okay. How about I pretend to be
a dinosaur. and you guess what kind it is.

552
00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:02.920
All right.

553
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.160
Okay.

554
00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:06.480
[roaring]

555
00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.000
-I have three horns on my head.
-Uh-huh.

556
00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.640
-[roars]
-Can I have another hint?

557
00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:15.160
I love vegetables! [roars]

558
00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.400
I know!

559
00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.720
Do you know what kind of dinosaur
Blippi's pretending to be?

560
00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.400
[Blippi growling]

561
00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.880
-A triceratops!
-Yeah!

562
00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.200
[both growling]

563
00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:28.600
Hey. Meekah. look at what it is!

564
00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.480
-[gasps]
-A triceratops!

565
00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.920
[both exclaiming]

566
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.800
Check out these horns.

567
00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:36.760
-Whoa.
-Ooh.

568
00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.280
These are so cool and pointy.
Oh. and. Meekah.

569
00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:43.720
did you know that a triceratops has horns
that are made of keratin?

570
00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.600
Yeah. It has a keratin part

571
00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.160
that is made of the same thing
as our nails.

572
00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:52.040
[gasps] So if it breaks off.
would it grow back. just like our nails?

573
00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.840
Yeah. the keratin part will. [chuckles]

574
00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.680
Whoa. you are one nice dinosaur.

575
00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.760
Okay. now it's your turn to pretend.

576
00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.080
-Okay! I'll give you some hints.
-Okay.

577
00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.600
[gibbering]

578
00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.960
-I have a crest on my head…
-Hmm.

579
00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.880
-…and I love to eat vegetables.
-Oh.

580
00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.280
-I'm an herbivore. Honk. honk!
-Oh. [laughs]

581
00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:17.160
-A honking sound? I know!
-Honk. honk. honk!

582
00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.840
I bet you're a parasaurolophus.

583
00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.600
Oh. that's right. Blippi! Great job.

584
00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.200
Yeah. Oh. good job pretending.

585
00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:27.560
-Uh-huh.
-And speaking of parasaurolophus…

586
00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.280
-Meekah!
-Oh!

587
00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.640
Check it out! A parasaurolophus!

588
00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:35.440
[Blippi] Oh yeah. This is a nice dino.
And do you see the head crest?

589
00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.520
Yeah. Some paleontologists say

590
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.360
that they use their crests
to communicate to each other.

591
00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:42.640
Oh. Meekah. I think you're right.
Honk. honk.

592
00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:45.760
-Honk. honk. honk. I'm hungry.
-Honk. honk. Me too.

593
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.280
Oh. honk. honk.
Here's some veggies for food.

594
00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.480
-Oh. yum!
-[both chewing noisily]

595
00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.240
-Honk. honk. honk. honk!
-Nom. nom. nom.

596
00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.040
-That's one funny dinosaur.
-Yeah.

597
00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.160
-Okay. My turn to pretend some more.
-Okay.

598
00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.920
Okay. Ooh! I know.

599
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.160
This dinosaur has big plates
on its back for protection.

600
00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:07.320
-Here we go. [exclaims]
-Here we go.

601
00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:11.320
And I have a really long tail
with a hammer on the end.

602
00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.480
-Whoa!
-Meekah. can you guess what dinosaur I am?

603
00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:17.720
[gasps] Oh. I know! An ankylosaurus?

604
00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.280
Yeah. that's right!

605
00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:22.360
Yeah. An ankylosaurus has
a tail like a hammer

606
00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.240
and bony plates for protection all over.

607
00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:26.800
Whoa. check it out!

608
00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.440
An ankylosaurus!

609
00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.440
Yeah. a baby ankylosaurus.

610
00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:32.920
They're really. really tough.

611
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
It even has it on its eyelids.

612
00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.120
-Oh. to protect its eyes?
-Yeah.

613
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.600
And on its head. and on its neck.
and on its back…

614
00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.840
-Oh. everywhere! On its tail too.
-It's so bumpy!

615
00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:49.120
Oh. But. Meekah. we need to
keep looking for the dino egg.

616
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.600
[gasps] I see some eggs over there!

617
00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.800
-Maybe that's the dino egg.
-Let's check it out.

618
00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:54.880
Okay.

619
00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.000
Meekah. look. Dinosaur eggs.

620
00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.200
But wait a minute.

621
00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:02.280
The egg we were looking for
is the color green.

622
00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.560
These eggs are not the color green.

623
00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.240
Meekah. maybe you can find the egg
by using your binoculars.

624
00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.560
-Yeah. Maybe I can find them that way.
-Okay.

625
00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.600
Keep your eyes open.

626
00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.960
-No eggs.
-Mmm. no eggs here.

627
00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.040
Ooh. maybe we need to check inside.

628
00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:22.440
Yeah. Let me check my map and make sure.

629
00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.920
-[Blippi] Hmm.
-Oh! We're looking for a fossil dig.

630
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.280
A fossil dig? Oh yeah!

631
00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.960
Maybe we'll find the egg
in the dirt in the fossil dig.

632
00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:32.200
All right.

633
00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.280
Let's go take a closer look inside.

634
00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:37.560
Mm-hmm. And we can pretend
to be flying dinosaurs.

635
00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.400
-Tyrannodon!
-[both squawking]

636
00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.000
That was fun being dinosaurs.

637
00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.960
I was the mighty tyrannodon.
flying through the sky.

638
00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.360
[squawks. chuckles]

639
00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:53.200
And I was the mighty chicken! [clucking]

640
00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:54.680
Meekah. why were you a chicken?

641
00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:59.280
Because chickens are the closest
living relatives to dinosaurs.

642
00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.560
Oh. I didn't know that.
That's pretty neat.

643
00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:06.040
Whoa! But look at this dino!
It's an allosaurus!

644
00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:09.200
-Hello. allosaurus.
-Aw. Yeah. he's so nice.

645
00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.760
-So colorful.
-Mm-hmm.

646
00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:14.240
-Oh. look. The color yellow.
-Oh. one of my favorites.

647
00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:17.840
-[gasps] Oh. and orange!
-One of my two favorites.

648
00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:19.320
And of course. the color green.

649
00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.720
And red too.

650
00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.240
Wow. You are so colorful.

651
00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:27.040
Well. Meekah and I were looking for
the fossil dig to find a missing egg.

652
00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.440
Have you seen any fossils around here.
Mr. Dino?

653
00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.840
-[dinosaur roars]
-What's that?

654
00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.440
[both] Uh-huh.

655
00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.560
-Nope.
-No fossils.

656
00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.000
Well. thanks anyway. [chuckles]

657
00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:40.880
-Check out these little dinosaurs.
-"Little dinosaurs"?

658
00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:44.120
Whoa! It's the ones we saw outside. Look!

659
00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.760
-Whoa!
-[both roaring]

660
00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:47.920
Oh. but. Meekah.

661
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.960
we saw these outside.
but we didn't hear them.

662
00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.280
Okay. Let's take a listen.

663
00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.040
Can you guess what dinosaur this is?
Are you ready?

664
00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:58.360
[dinosaur roaring]

665
00:29:58.440 --> 00:29:59.520
Whoa!

666
00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:03.840
I know by the honking horn sound
that it's a parasaurolophus.

667
00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:07.080
Oh. good guess.
Okay. let's try another one.

668
00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.640
-[dinosaur roaring]
-[gasps]

669
00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:13.560
Whoa! I know that one! It's a T-Rex!

670
00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:15.600
-[shrieks. laughs]
-Oh. right.

671
00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:18.440
We were supposed to be looking for
mama T-Rex's egg.

672
00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:21.120
Hmm. We need to find
that fossil dig somewhere.

673
00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.480
Oh. look.
I see a place for digging over there.

674
00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.240
I bet we'll find the egg. Come on!

675
00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:33.000
[gasps] Wow!

676
00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:36.560
-Meekah. it's the…
-[both] Fossil dig!

677
00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.920
-I bet we'll find the egg here.
-Oh yes.

678
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.440
Okay. Let's get all ready.

679
00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:42.000
What kind of tools do we have?

680
00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.720
Well. I brought some gloves for you.

681
00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.280
-Oh. thanks. friend.
-Yeah. some purple ones for you.

682
00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.640
-And some orange for me.
-Oh. nice.

683
00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.760
Oh yeah. ̋This is gonna get a little messy.

684
00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:54.280
-so we want to keep our hands clean.
-[giggling]

685
00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.520
And. Meekah. look what else I have.

686
00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:57.920
-What?
-Some…

687
00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.720
Ooh! [gasps]

688
00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:00.800
-What's in there?
-Shovels!

689
00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.000
-Oh. some shovels.
-Oh.

690
00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.680
Oh. but I have an idea.

691
00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:07.440
-Let's use our brushes instead.
-Oh yeah.

692
00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:10.240
When you're looking for fossils.
fossils can be delicate.

693
00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.560
so you don't want to damage them
with hard metal shovels.

694
00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:16.920
And we are just pretending.
but we use brushes for fun too.

695
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.560
-Let's be extra careful.
-Okay. Here we go.

696
00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.880
Time to get out
our paleontologist brushes.

697
00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.440
-Oh yeah.
-Let's see what fossils we'll find.

698
00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:27.520
-Come on.
-Cheers.

699
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:28.840
-Cheers.
-Happy digging.

700
00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.440
Happy digging.

701
00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.480
Whoa!
Look at all these layers of sediment.

702
00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:35.520
Oh yeah. We're digging in the dirt.

703
00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:38.560
but this is actually very.
very deep in the ground.

704
00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:41.520
See? Some topsoil
and all the different layers.

705
00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:42.880
Whoa.

706
00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.760
And look. The fossils!

707
00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:46.560
-[Meekah] Whoa.
-Oh.

708
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.440
-[Meekah gasps] I found one!
-Whoa. me too!

709
00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.880
[both chuckle]

710
00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.320
-Whoa. These are heavy.
-Oh. very heavy.

711
00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:55.360
Yeah. Whoa. I found a tooth.

712
00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:58.600
And I found a-- What is it?
A tooth? A fang?

713
00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.480
-Ooh. looks like a claw.
-Oh. a claw.

714
00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.200
[squawks] Maybe to a raptor.

715
00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.000
Ooh. Or a tyrannodon.

716
00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:06.080
Oh. that would be so cool!

717
00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.800
Mmm. let's see what else we can find.

718
00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.040
[Blippi] Whoa. I found one!

719
00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:11.480
[Meekah] Oh. me too!

720
00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.720
[Blippi] Wait a minute.
Meekah. look at this.

721
00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:15.240
[gasps] That's a…

722
00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:16.760
-Leaf?
-Leaf!

723
00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:18.600
I didn't know plants could be fossils.

724
00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:23.200
Oh yeah. Fossils can be plants
or bones or skulls.

725
00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.280
-Or bugs.
-[laughing]

726
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.520
Well. let's see what else.

727
00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:28.680
-[Blippi] Did you find one?
-Look what I found.

728
00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.680
Whoa! What's that?

729
00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:32.480
It's an ammonite shell.

730
00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.880
Oh. An ammonite shell.

731
00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:35.960
Wow.

732
00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:37.520
Ammonites are cool.

733
00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:40.000
Kinda looks like a snail. but not a snail.

734
00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.920
Really spirally.

735
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.080
And this one's heavy.

736
00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.960
-[Blippi] Hmm.
-Anything else?

737
00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:50.360
Whoa. Meekah. look!
I found another fossil.

738
00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.800
-Whoa.
-It's a seashell.

739
00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.360
Hey. and this fossil's pretty light.

740
00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.200
[gasps] I have an idea! Let's play…

741
00:32:58.280 --> 00:32:59.760
[both] Sink or Float!

742
00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.760
Yeah. And we can see
how dense all the fossils are

743
00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:05.160
and if they sink or if they float.

744
00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:08.520
Oh. Let's go see if we can find
any water nearby.

745
00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.920
Yeah. And then we can tell the museum
which fossils sink or float.

746
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.400
and we'll make sure to return them
after we play with them.

747
00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.800
Uh-huh. I'll put them in my jam pack.

748
00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:19.080
Okay. I'll put these in my backpack.

749
00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:21.280
and I think we are good to go.

750
00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:22.800
-Ready?
-Come on!

751
00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:23.880
Whoo!

752
00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:41.280
Whoa! This tank of water
will be perfect for a game of…

753
00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.600
[both] Sink or Float!

754
00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:45.000
We'll test the item's density.

755
00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:48.160
That's how closely packed
the particles are inside the item.

756
00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:51.400
Mm-hmm. yeah. We can use
all the things in my backpack and…

757
00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.280
-My jam pack.
-Yeah.

758
00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.400
Ooh. let's start with these fossils.

759
00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:57.560
Oh yeah. Here. do you mind if I try some?

760
00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.600
-Of course. friend.
-Okay.

761
00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:03.400
Whoa! Yeah. we found all of these fossils.

762
00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:05.040
so let's see how dense they are.

763
00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:07.680
If they're really dense.
that means they'll sink.

764
00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:11.000
But if they're not so dense. yeah.
they'll float to the top.

765
00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.080
-Whoa.
-Okay. Here we go.

766
00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:14.360
On the count of three.

767
00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.520
[both] One. two. three.

768
00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:17.679
Whoo-hoo!

769
00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.120
-Whoa!
-Oh!

770
00:34:19.199 --> 00:34:21.159
-Check it out!
-They sank!

771
00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:23.960
Whoa! Hello. fossils.

772
00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:27.080
-Whoo!
-Fossils are really heavy.

773
00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:29.760
-Yeah. and really dense.
-Mm-hmm.

774
00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:33.480
Yeah. must be from all that dirt
packing in and preserving those fossils

775
00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:36.080
-after a really. really. really long time.
-Yep. must be.

776
00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:38.520
-Oh. hey. Let's try some other things.
-Okay.

777
00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.320
Whoa. What about this water bottle?

778
00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:42.199
-All right.
-Hey. look what's on it.

779
00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.040
-Oh. dinosaurs!
-And me.

780
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.120
-That's silly. Oh yeah.
-My best friend. Blippi.

781
00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:51.480
Okay. do you think this water bottle
will sink or float?

782
00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:53.679
Let's see!

783
00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.480
Here we go! Whoo!

784
00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.640
-Whoa! It floats! Hmm.
-Oh!

785
00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.560
I wonder if we open it up a little bit.
if it will still float?

786
00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:03.200
Here we go.

787
00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:04.680
[Meekah gasps]

788
00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.680
-Well…
-Well… Oh!

789
00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.440
Oh. check it out!

790
00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:13.440
When we opened it up.
the water bottle sank to the bottom.

791
00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:14.960
But when the lid was on.

792
00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.040
it floated.

793
00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:18.160
Mm-hmm. That's because it's full of water.

794
00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.120
Whoa. That is really cool.

795
00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.640
-Let's try something else. Okay.
-Okay. Whatcha got?

796
00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:23.920
Hmm.

797
00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.720
[chuckles] There are
so many things in here. Whoa. okay.

798
00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.760
-Here. One for you…
-Oh. thank you.

799
00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.760
-…and one for me.
-Ooh. a sponge.

800
00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.000
And a ball pit ball.

801
00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.320
-Wait a minute. Meekah…
-Yes?

802
00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.120
…look at what colors these are.

803
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:40.000
-[gasps] Your two favorite colors!
-Blue and orange!

804
00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.360
Yeah. We have an orange ball pit ball.
a blue sponge…

805
00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.120
-Mm-hmm.
-Let's see if they sink or float.

806
00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:45.760
-Okay. pal.
-Here we go!

807
00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.640
-Whoo-hoo!
-Whoo!

808
00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.000
-Whoa. look!
-Wow!

809
00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.120
They float. Whoa. Whoa.

810
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:53.920
[chuckles] Whoa.

811
00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:56.800
Okay. Let's try another one.

812
00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.440
Okay. What else is in there?

813
00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:00.560
[both roaring]

814
00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:05.600
Whoa! Dinosaurs! Yeah.

815
00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.880
Let's see if these toy dinosaurs
sink or float.

816
00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:10.280
Okay. Here we go.
They want to go swimming.

817
00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:12.600
[both roaring]

818
00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:14.840
[laughing]

819
00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:16.840
Whoa. They love swimming at the top.

820
00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.680
-Yeah. they float.
-Yep.

821
00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:21.200
[roaring softly] Whoa. yeah.

822
00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:24.160
Those dinosaurs are toys.
so they're not very dense.

823
00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:28.040
but if they were real dinosaurs.
hmm. maybe they would sink.

824
00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:29.800
Oh. definitely.

825
00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:32.000
Oh. Hey. Meekah. Here you go.

826
00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:34.680
What's in there? Oh. a race car!

827
00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:36.680
[imitating motor revving]

828
00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:41.960
What do you think?
Will this race car sink or float?

829
00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:45.600
-Let's give it a try!
-Okay. ready?

830
00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:50.080
Whoa! Whoa!

831
00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:53.080
-Oh no!
-Oh. look. It floats.

832
00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:56.040
Look. Even when I push it down. like this…

833
00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:01.680
-It still wants to float.
-Yeah. Comes back to the top.

834
00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.880
Well. that was cool. Oh. Mmm.

835
00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:05.680
-Anything else? Oh!
-What else we got?

836
00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:06.760
Here you go.

837
00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.560
Ooh. a carrot. Perfect.

838
00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.480
And a little shovel. [gasps]

839
00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.280
-Crunchy.
-[laughing]

840
00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:15.720
Okay. let's try the carrot
and the little shovel.

841
00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:18.280
Okay. On the count of three.
One. two. three.

842
00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.360
Whoo-hoo!

843
00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:23.720
Whoa! No way! They sank to the bottom!

844
00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:26.480
-Whoa! Whoa!
-Whoa!

845
00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:27.920
[exclaiming]

846
00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.760
That's pretty cold. Whoa!

847
00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:32.880
Yeah. They were really dense.

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:26.240
-There you go. friend.
-Okay. Here we go.

1018
00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:29.680
-Time to operate the excavator.
-I'll look for the egg with my binoculars.

1019
00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.800
[both exclaiming]

1020
00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:35.680
Driving an excavator can be
a little tricky sometimes.

1021
00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:37.960
-Yes. it is. But you've got it.
-Okay.

1022
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.840
Here we go. [screeching]

1023
00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:45.040
Scoop 'em up!

1024
00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:47.920
-Great job. Blippi!
-Yeah!

1025
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.680
[both exclaim]

1026
00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:54.520
-Is there an egg in there. Meekah?
-Um. no.

1027
00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:56.960
-No egg.
-Mmm. yeah.

1028
00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:59.400
Still doesn't look like
there's an egg in here.

1029
00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:02.080
Well. time is ticking.
so we should keep looking.

1030
00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:05.360
Mm-hmm. Let's keep on looking.
and the best way to keep looking

1031
00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:07.280
is to pretend to be an excavator.

1032
00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:09.040
Oh. great idea!

1033
00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:11.160
Hey. will you pretend with us?

1034
00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:16.160
[laughs] Awesome. Okay.
All you need to do is bring up your arm

1035
00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:20.560
to be the arm. the boom and the bucket
and start to scoop.

1036
00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.160
[imitating excavator]

1037
00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:24.560
-Hey. dirt…
-See you later.

1038
00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:27.120
-Come on!
-Scoop. scoop!

1039
00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.720
-Whoa! Whoa!
-Scoop. scoop.

1040
00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:33.800
[Blippi] Whoa!

1041
00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:37.960
-[Blippi] Excavators.
-[imitating excavator]

1042
00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:44.040
Whoa. Meekah! Look at what it is!

1043
00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:46.200
[both] A conveyor belt!

1044
00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:51.440
Whoa. Yeah.
Conveyor belts are really useful machines

1045
00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:53.880
that get really heavy things
from the ground

1046
00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:56.360
up to a very. very tall place.

1047
00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:00.680
Hmm. And maybe this conveyor belt can
move some of these heavy bricks.

1048
00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:03.920
Oh. how about you go to the top.

1049
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.240
and I'll load the bricks
on to the conveyor belt.

1050
00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:07.440
and you can receive them?

1051
00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:10.240
-That's a good plan. See you at the top.
-See you. friend.

1052
00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:11.840
Whoo! [chuckles]

1053
00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:13.480
Oh. I almost forgot.

1054
00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:14.880
I want to take off my shoes.

1055
00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:16.640
One…

1056
00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:18.640
and two.

1057
00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:20.400
[chuckles] See you at the top.

1058
00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:30.680
Turning my wheel so the bricks go
all the way up to Blippi.

1059
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:32.040
[gasps]

1060
00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:33.920
Do you know what this shape is?

1061
00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:37.680
That's right. It's a rectangle.

1062
00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:39.800
Oh. with another shape too.

1063
00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:41.320
A circle.

1064
00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:42.760
Let's count the circles.

1065
00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:44.640
One circle.

1066
00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:45.960
two circles.

1067
00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:47.720
three circles!

1068
00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:49.280
Wow!

1069
00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.720
Okay. Blippi. here they come.

1070
00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:55.200
Okay. Meekah. I'm at the top.

1071
00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:57.360
Whoa! Check it out.

1072
00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:59.480
There are so many bricks up here.

1073
00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:02.080
Meekah. what do you think
we should build with all these bricks?

1074
00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.800
Ooh. how about a post office?

1075
00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:06.520
Yeah. Or maybe a little house.

1076
00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:09.680
-Or maybe a library.
-Ooh. that's a good idea.

1077
00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:12.160
Meekah. do you see any eggs down there?

1078
00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:14.480
No eggs here. Just lots of bricks.

1079
00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:17.280
Well. there are no eggs up here either.

1080
00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:19.840
Ooh. but I do see some blocks
in the corner there.

1081
00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:23.200
Maybe we should check underneath those
blue blocks to see if there's an egg.

1082
00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:25.920
Oh. great idea. I'll race you there.

1083
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.120
Race you there.

1084
00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:31.480
Oh! Blippi. you forgot your shoes!

1085
00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:53.280
-That was fun.
-You win!

1086
00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:55.560
-I win? Yeah!
-Uh-huh. And you get a prize.

1087
00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:57.760
-A prize for me?
-Uh-huh.

1088
00:48:57.840 --> 00:48:58.960
Your shoes!

1089
00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:02.000
Oh. Okay. Thanks. Meekah.

1090
00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:03.480
[both] Whoa!

1091
00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:05.440
Look at all these blocks.

1092
00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:06.520
Cool!

1093
00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:07.960
So many different shapes.

1094
00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:09.480
and they're all the color blue.

1095
00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:15.000
Look at this square!

1096
00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:16.640
-Whoa!
-With a circle!

1097
00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:19.160
Look at this circle… with two circles.

1098
00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:21.040
-Hello.
-Hello!

1099
00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:22.560
-Whoo!
-Whee!

1100
00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:26.360
-Whoa. And there's all kinds of shapes.
-Whoa. like a trapezoid.

1101
00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:28.160
Whoa. Yeah.

1102
00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:30.080
Look. I have a trapezoid too.

1103
00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:31.840
They make very nice hats.

1104
00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:34.000
Oh. what else do we have?

1105
00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:36.440
Ooh. a parallelogram.

1106
00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:39.760
Whoa. That's a pretty big name
for a shape. Whoo!

1107
00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:42.000
Oh. and a cylinder.

1108
00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:44.400
Ooh. and this is a tiny noodle.

1109
00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:46.600
[chuckles]
A really long and small cylinder.

1110
00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:48.080
Oh!

1111
00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.920
This shape is a hexagon.

1112
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.920
Mm-hmm. Yeah. and this is
one cool-looking hexagon.

1113
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.960
Look how many sides it has.

1114
00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:56.920
[both] One. two…

1115
00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.000
Three…

1116
00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:00.520
[both] Four. five. six.

1117
00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:03.120
-Six sides!
-That's a lot of sides for a shape.

1118
00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.360
Whoo! [laughs]

1119
00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:06.280
Oh. and look at this shape.

1120
00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:08.440
Do you know what this is?

1121
00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:11.880
-It's a triangle!
-Yes. just like a roof on a house.

1122
00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:14.400
-Whoo!
-Hey. I have an idea.

1123
00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:17.640
You should look for the eggs
in this big sack of blue blocks.

1124
00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:19.440
Okay. Time to climb on in.

1125
00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:20.960
-Okay.
-Here I go.

1126
00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:29.640
-[roars]
-[screams] A dinosaur! Run!

1127
00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:33.440
Yeah. I just found me being a T-Rex.

1128
00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:35.800
Yeah. well. I don't see any eggs here.

1129
00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:37.680
-Nope.
-Just more blue blocks.

1130
00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:39.000
Blue blocks.

1131
00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:41.640
-Whoo! [chuckles]
-Oh. Blippi.

1132
00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:44.080
I see something really fun over there!

1133
00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:45.960
-Maybe that's where the egg is.
-Maybe!

1134
00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:47.800
Okay. let's go. Whoo-hoo!

1135
00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.840
[Blippi imitating dinosaur roaring]

1136
00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:59.440
Hmm.

1137
00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:01.760
Well. I still don't see the egg anywhere.

1138
00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:04.560
but. Meekah. I do see tractors!

1139
00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:06.640
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

1140
00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:09.120
-[both] Tractor race!
-Let's go!

1141
00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:10.440
Whoo-hoo!

1142
00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:15.200
Drivers. start your pedals!

1143
00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:16.520
Whoo!

1144
00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:35.240
[laughing. cheering]

1145
00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:36.680
[both] Whoa!

1146
00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:42.240
-Meekah. you win the race!
-Yay! I won!

1147
00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:44.280
-And you win a prize.
-Oh. what is it?

1148
00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:47.200
-The Best Friend award.
-Awesome!

1149
00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:49.880
-And two high-fives.
-All right!

1150
00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:53.560
Wait. Blippi. we're supposed to be
looking for the blue-and-purple egg.

1151
00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:55.800
That's right.
We don't have much time left.

1152
00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:57.960
Where have we not checked? Hmm.

1153
00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:01.120
[both muttering]

1154
00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:03.560
Oh. wait! Meekah. look!
A place we haven't checked yet.

1155
00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:05.000
-Come on!
-Come on!

1156
00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:08.680
[both laughing]

1157
00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:10.360
-Wow!
-Whoa!

1158
00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:12.040
What's this?

1159
00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:14.400
It looks like… building supplies?

1160
00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:16.400
Yeah. I love to tinker and build.

1161
00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:18.480
-Can I help you out?
-Yes. please.

1162
00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:21.680
Okay. Well. what do we have here?
We have some wheels…

1163
00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:24.480
-Ooh. and some screws.
-Yeah.

1164
00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:26.400
-A rope.
-What if we make a cart?

1165
00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:29.840
[gasps] Great idea.
And then we can roll around in it.

1166
00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:33.160
Yeah. First we need to attach
these L thingies to some wheels.

1167
00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:34.240
Great.

1168
00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:44.600
And now we should take these wheels
and put them on a platform.

1169
00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:46.640
-Okay.
-Here. How about I hold it up.

1170
00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:48.160
and you can screw them together?

1171
00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:54.640
And tighten the bolt so the wheels don't
fall off when you're dragging it around.

1172
00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:58.360
-Nice and tight.
-Oh. cool. We have one of the wheels done.

1173
00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:01.920
-Okay. let's do another wheel.
-Second wheel. Here we go.

1174
00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:07.880
-We need two more wheels.
-Okay.

1175
00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:11.320
Here. let's put
this red piece on top. and…

1176
00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:12.760
Here's a wheel for you.

1177
00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:15.040
-And here is a wheel for you.
-I'll hold the back.

1178
00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:16.760
-Thank you.
-Okay. You can hold up the wagon.

1179
00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:18.840
and I'll start screwing in
some more of these wheels.

1180
00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:19.920
Sure.

1181
00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:30.240
Nice and tight.
and we're ready for a ride.

1182
00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:32.240
-Okay. Here we go.
-Whoo!

1183
00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:38.680
Okay. Are you ready. Meekah?

1184
00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:40.760

Is that an excavator track?

And then we get to put it
down the racetrack!

1203
00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:26.960
Okay.

we were looking for dino eggs.

We gotta go!

1226

Whoa! Meekah. look at this!

1227
00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:45.320
Oh. I know what this is.
It's a pulley system.

1228

-Oh. cool.
-Mm-hmm.

1229
00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:49.840
A pulley is basically
a rope tied to a wheel.

1230
00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:54.280
and it changes the lifting force.
so you can easily lift heavy things.

1231
00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:57.640
Oh yeah. And basically.
you can put things in this bag.

1232
00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:59.320
-Yup.
-And it will do the heavy lifting for you.

1233
00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:01.680
Oh. should we try it
with this stuff in this crate?

1234
00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:03.120
Yeah. What's in there?

1235
00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:06.400
We have a yellow
