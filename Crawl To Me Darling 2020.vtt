00:33:04.016 --> 00:33:06.985
[dark guitar music]

188
00:33:07.019 --> 00:33:07.986
Millie!

189
00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:10.229
[grunting]

190
00:33:11.886 --> 00:33:13.508
It's okay. it's okay.

191
00:33:13.543 --> 00:33:16.684
Millie. shhh. I'm
trying to help you.

192
00:33:16.718 --> 00:33:19.066
- What the fuck
have you done to me?

193
00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:20.619
- It's a side effect
of the drugs. Millie.

194
00:33:20.653 --> 00:33:24.209
it's a loss of strength.
a loss of coordination.

195
00:33:24.243 --> 00:33:26.245
I want to stop
giving them to you

196
00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.936
but you have to start listening.

197
00:33:27.971 --> 00:33:29.869
- What do you want?

198
00:33:29.904 --> 00:33:31.043
You want to fuck
me. then fuck me.

199
00:33:31.078 --> 00:33:32.631
If you want to kill
me. just end it.

200
00:33:32.665 --> 00:33:34.288
just fucking do it now.

201
00:33:37.843 --> 00:33:42.606
- Millie. Millie. there's
so much more than that.

202
00:33:44.919 --> 00:33:46.472
Millie. I want you.

203
00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:49.544
I want all of you.

204
00:33:52.651 --> 00:33:56.206
But you have to start
listening to what I say.

205
00:33:56.241 --> 00:33:58.381
It will be so much easier.

206
00:34:00.038 --> 00:34:02.695
- You should listen to yourself.

207
00:34:15.846 --> 00:34:17.538
Don't you think it's
a bit late for that?

208
00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:27.548
- Millie. I'm gonna
have to hurt you now.

209
00:34:27.582 --> 00:34:28.445
I am so sorry.

210
00:34:31.759 --> 00:34:35.314
I don't want to hurt
you but I have to.

211
00:34:35.349 --> 00:34:39.215
You're going to
wake up every day

212
00:34:39.249 --> 00:34:41.803
from a nightmare
covered in sweat

213
00:34:41.838 --> 00:34:44.910
but it won't be my
face that you see.

214
00:34:47.257 --> 00:34:50.778
The mask is more
important than you think.

215
00:35:07.864 --> 00:35:10.522
[ominous music]

216
00:37:04.532 --> 00:37:05.361
Bite this.

217
00:37:08.571 --> 00:37:11.263
I don't want you chewing
through your tongue again.

218
00:37:27.659 --> 00:37:28.832
This is going to hurt. Millie.

219
00:37:34.286 --> 00:37:36.530
But this is our last chance.

220
00:37:37.634 --> 00:37:40.741
[heartbeat pounding]

221
00:37:49.715 --> 00:37:52.615
[zapping]

222
00:37:52.649 --> 00:37:54.996
I'm trying to help you.

223
00:37:55.031 --> 00:37:57.275
[groaning]

224
00:37:59.035 --> 00:38:00.174
- [Millie] Wait.

225
00:38:00.208 --> 00:38:01.382
[zapping]

226
00:38:01.417 --> 00:38:02.590
- [Masked Man] You're
going to be so happy

227
00:38:02.625 --> 00:38:05.006
but you just have to let me in.

228
00:38:05.041 --> 00:38:07.285
[grunting]

229
00:38:09.459 --> 00:38:11.012
[zapping]

230
00:38:11.047 --> 00:38:13.187
Why are you making
me do this. Millie?

231
00:38:13.221 --> 00:38:15.534
[grunting]

232
00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:21.782
It shouldn't have
to be this way.

233
00:38:25.717 --> 00:38:27.166
[zapping]

234
00:38:27.201 --> 00:38:29.341
It should be easy. Millie.

235
00:38:30.342 --> 00:38:33.069
Stop making me do this.

236
00:38:33.103 --> 00:38:35.347
[zapping]

237
00:38:35.382 --> 00:38:36.555
Stop making me hurt you.

238
00:38:38.385 --> 00:38:39.938
This is your fault. Millie.

239
00:38:41.526 --> 00:38:43.321
You're making this
more difficult

240
00:38:43.355 --> 00:38:44.322
than it ever needed to be.

241
00:38:46.185 --> 00:38:49.292
[heartbeat pounding]

242
00:38:52.537 --> 00:38:54.711
[zapping]

243
00:40:11.926 --> 00:40:13.652
- You're awake. good.

244
00:40:14.722 --> 00:40:15.861
Millie. can you hear me?

245
00:40:15.896 --> 00:40:17.104
Yeah?

246
00:40:17.138 --> 00:40:19.313
Millie. Millie talk to me.

247
00:40:21.557 --> 00:40:23.593
I managed to break the
lock on the door. okay.

248
00:40:23.628 --> 00:40:25.595
you're out now. you're safe.

249
00:40:27.977 --> 00:40:29.150
- Who are you?

250
00:40:30.566 --> 00:40:32.084
- I'm your friend.

251
00:40:34.984 --> 00:40:35.916
Can you walk?

252
00:40:37.262 --> 00:40:38.608
Millie. can you walk?

253
00:40:40.334 --> 00:40:41.162
Come on up. use me.

254
00:40:42.301 --> 00:40:45.270
[breathing heavily]

255
00:40:46.685 --> 00:40:47.893
Millie look at me.

256
00:40:47.928 --> 00:40:49.412
okay it's just
one straight road.

257
00:40:49.447 --> 00:40:50.102
All right. you need to just
go straight down there.

258
00:40:50.137 --> 00:40:51.172
- What happened?

259
00:40:51.207 --> 00:40:52.691
- We've gone for a while yet.

260
00:40:52.726 --> 00:40:54.486
Now's your chance to leave?

261
00:40:54.521 --> 00:40:55.349
- I can't.

262
00:40:56.592 --> 00:40:57.558
- Yes you can.

263
00:40:57.593 --> 00:40:58.835
- I can't.
- Yes you can.

264
00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:59.905
- I can't run from this.

265
00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:00.975
- You can. yes you can.

266
00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:02.045
Yes. you can.

267
00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:03.737
- I can't leave him.

268
00:41:07.672 --> 00:41:09.294
- What did you say?

269
00:41:10.537 --> 00:41:12.297
- I don't want to go.

270
00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:26.311
- It worked.

271
00:41:32.559 --> 00:41:35.216
[ominous music]

272
00:41:46.642 --> 00:41:47.470
- She just left me there.

273
00:41:56.099 --> 00:41:57.031
I had no idea where I was

274
00:41:57.066 --> 00:41:58.343
and I wasn't gonna follow her.

275
00:42:06.075 --> 00:42:07.179
I looked around for
a road or a sign

276
00:42:07.214 --> 00:42:09.216
but I couldn't find any.

277
00:42:13.634 --> 00:42:15.498
And then I followed the
tracks back to the house.

278
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:20.468
- But you were gone for hours?

279
00:42:23.437 --> 00:42:25.922
- It's okay. I liked the walk.

280
00:42:37.658 --> 00:42:42.663
- And you still came
back all by yourself.

281
00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:48.531
- I was testing her.

282
00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:53.156
You did it. well done.

283
00:42:55.538 --> 00:42:56.643
- You were testing her?

284
00:43:02.338 --> 00:43:03.581
How were you testing her?

285
00:43:06.135 --> 00:43:07.343
- To see if she'd run.

286
00:43:17.215 --> 00:43:20.114
- Do you think she
was testing you?

287
00:43:23.255 --> 00:43:24.084
- No.

288
00:43:36.096 --> 00:43:38.719
- You could've
ruined everything.

289
00:43:39.755 --> 00:43:42.171
- She's already done that.

290
00:43:42.205 --> 00:43:43.966
- But anything could
have happened to her.

291
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.209
- No. there's no way
she would have left.

292
00:43:46.244 --> 00:43:48.246
The grounds are far too big.

293
00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:49.212
It just wouldn't have
worked. you know that.

294
00:43:49.247 --> 00:43:50.213
- Give me the ring.

295
00:43:55.287 --> 00:43:56.081
- What?

296
00:43:59.429 --> 00:44:01.086
You don't mean that.

297
00:44:03.123 --> 00:44:04.055
- Give me the ring.

298
00:44:09.647 --> 00:44:10.924
Give me the ring.

299
00:44:10.958 --> 00:44:14.375
- Please. please
you don't mean this.

300
00:44:14.410 --> 00:44:17.655
No. no you don't mean
it you don't mean it.

301
00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:20.761
Stop please stop.

302
00:44:21.762 --> 00:44:23.384
Please look.

303
00:44:23.419 --> 00:44:26.077
[gentle music]

304
00:44:40.885 --> 00:44:42.127
- [Masked Man] Millie.
I want you to marry me.

305
00:44:44.958 --> 00:44:46.476
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.

306
00:44:48.962 --> 00:44:51.378
Millie. you now have
free reign of the house.

307
00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:55.796
I will get you your
list of duties.

308
00:44:55.831 --> 00:44:57.936
Our wedding is set for two days.

309
00:45:00.318 --> 00:45:01.491
Make sure you're ready.

310
00:45:09.983 --> 00:45:12.744
[ominous music]

311
00:45:20.476 --> 00:45:23.962
You have two days to alter
your dress to fit Millie

312
00:45:26.137 --> 00:45:28.415
and then I'll decide
what to do with you.

313
00:45:33.454 --> 00:45:36.112
[ominous music]

314
00:46:03.795 --> 00:46:05.935
[ticking]

315
00:46:07.419 --> 00:46:10.768
Dear Millie. my
requests are as follows.

316
00:46:12.114 --> 00:46:14.633
At six a.m.. I want
you up and out of bed.

317
00:46:16.049 --> 00:46:19.017
At 6:30. you should be dressed
and presentable for the day.

318
00:46:22.055 --> 00:46:24.057
You will serve breakfast
after my shower

319
00:46:25.403 --> 00:46:27.923
consisting of a
slice of brown toast.

320
00:46:29.683 --> 00:46:30.546
a boiled egg.

321
00:46:32.134 --> 00:46:35.965
a cup of black coffee and a
pear by seven o'clock sharp.

322
00:46:38.450 --> 00:46:40.452
Then you are to attend
to the household.

323
00:46:43.283 --> 00:46:45.975
You are to clean the main
bathroom twice a day.

324
00:46:49.565 --> 00:46:52.982
Once after my shower and another
at a time that suits you.

325
00:46:56.779 --> 00:46:59.851
The kitchen will be
spotless at all times.

326
00:46:59.886 --> 00:47:00.887
even whilst cooking.

327
00:47:07.445 --> 00:47:08.549
I do not ask for much.

328
00:47:13.934 --> 00:47:16.247
only to be respected

329
00:47:16.281 --> 00:47:18.318
and for our home to be
regarded in the same manner.

330
00:47:26.498 --> 00:47:29.225
Zoe will be fitting you
for your wedding dress

331
00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:31.227
and she will also
officiate on the day.

332
00:47:38.648 --> 00:47:40.547
She is only here on
a temporary basis.

333
00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:49.556
After the wedding. I will
decide on how to dispose of her.

334
00:47:55.424 --> 00:47:56.874
But for now. pay no
attention to her.

335
00:48:01.637 --> 00:48:05.227
Yours faithfully. your
darling husband to be.

336
00:48:06.745 --> 00:48:09.852
[lighthearted music]

337
00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:49.365
[Zoe yelling]

338
00:50:19.119 --> 00:50:21.328
- I came to make some
adjustments to the dress

339
00:50:21.363 --> 00:50:23.192
and I just found it like this.

340
00:50:23.227 --> 00:50:25.677
She doesn't deserve the ring.

341
00:50:31.269 --> 00:50:32.270
- It's okay.

342
00:50:33.927 --> 00:50:36.895
It's okay. okay calm down.

343
00:50:36.930 --> 00:50:38.656
come here. it's okay.

344
00:50:44.489 --> 00:50:46.526
When I first saw you.
I was speechless.

345
00:50:53.774 --> 00:50:55.845
You were the most beautiful
girl I'd ever seen.

346
00:51:00.988 --> 00:51:01.955
So I followed you

347
00:51:05.338 --> 00:51:06.166
to your house.

348
00:51:08.341 --> 00:51:09.169
to your work.

349
00:51:14.174 --> 00:51:16.625
I had to be sure that you
were who you said you were.

350
00:51:19.869 --> 00:51:21.078
I had to do my research.

351
00:51:24.909 --> 00:51:28.464
I spent months planning

352
00:51:28.499 --> 00:51:31.018
and thinking what it
would be like to have you

353
00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:33.124
and when I finally got you

354
00:51:33.159 --> 00:51:35.022
I truly believed that
it would be perfect.

355
00:51:48.829 --> 00:51:51.522
But perhaps I made
some mistakes.

356
00:51:57.148 --> 00:51:58.115
I am so sorry.

357
00:51:59.288 --> 00:52:01.635
[dark music]

358
00:52:04.535 --> 00:52:07.296
[Zoe struggling]

359
00:52:12.957 --> 00:52:15.960
Millie. I promise I will
never let this happen to you.

360
00:52:22.139 --> 00:52:23.209
- I tore up the dress.

361
00:52:28.697 --> 00:52:30.561
- You tore up the dress?

362
00:52:30.595 --> 00:52:31.700
- I tore up the dress.

363
00:52:38.362 --> 00:52:39.190
- Why?

364
00:52:42.228 --> 00:52:44.471
- Because it was her dress
and it's my wedding day

365
00:52:44.506 --> 00:52:46.749
and I don't want to wear
her dress on my day.

366
00:52:56.932 --> 00:52:58.071
- That's fair.

367
00:53:35.867 --> 00:53:37.973
[crying]

368
00:53:59.926 --> 00:54:02.549
[ominous music]

369
00:55:19.039 --> 00:55:21.318
[knocking]

370
00:55:24.873 --> 00:55:25.701
- You can't sleep either?

371
00:55:29.049 --> 00:55:30.879
- You should try
turning the lights off.

372
00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:36.263
[dark gentle music]

373
00:55:59.252 --> 00:56:00.667
Millie. I'm sorry.

374
00:56:04.015 --> 00:56:05.016
- It's okay.

375
00:56:05.051 --> 00:56:06.535
- No. no it isn't.

376
00:56:08.399 --> 00:56:09.366
- It's okay.

377
00:56:14.301 --> 00:56:15.510
- Are you okay?

378
00:56:33.044 --> 00:56:34.770
Why did you stop him?

379
00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:43.917
- I didn't think
you deserved it.

380
00:56:46.472 --> 00:56:48.232
- [Zoe] I think I do.

381
00:56:49.958 --> 00:56:50.786
- Why?

382
00:56:53.927 --> 00:56:56.482
[gentle music]

383
00:57:02.729 --> 00:57:05.939
- For a time he was good to me.

384
00:57:10.599 --> 00:57:13.499
We would walk around for
hours through the grounds

385
00:57:13.533 --> 00:57:15.052
just to find the perfect spot.

386
00:57:16.398 --> 00:57:19.056
[gentle music]

387
00:57:48.326 --> 00:57:50.363
Just me and him.

388
00:57:50.397 --> 00:57:51.640
We would have lunch there

389
00:57:54.471 --> 00:57:57.163
and spend the day
just doing nothing.

390
00:58:05.896 --> 00:58:06.724
nothing at all.

391
00:58:14.283 --> 00:58:16.941
[gentle music]

392
00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:44.451
We had it all to ourselves

393
00:58:44.486 --> 00:58:47.869
and it was just the
right place to escape.

394
00:58:48.939 --> 00:58:51.597
[gentle music]

395
00:58:57.603 --> 00:59:00.571
But I couldn't
see past his face.

396
00:59:00.606 --> 00:59:01.468
I couldn't sleep

397
00:59:02.608 --> 00:59:04.126
without dreaming of him
trying to pin me down

398
00:59:05.265 --> 00:59:07.302
or him chasing me down
through the woods.

399
00:59:13.653 --> 00:59:15.413
I couldn't tell
them apart anymore.

400
00:59:16.622 --> 00:59:19.072
I would wake up covered in sweat

401
00:59:19.107 --> 00:59:21.558
terrified of which one
was sleeping next to me.

402
00:59:28.841 --> 00:59:30.221
His hands that were
stroking my hair

403
00:59:30.256 --> 00:59:32.016
were the same ones
that tied me down.

404
00:59:34.709 --> 00:59:37.470
[ominous music]

405
00:59:42.371 --> 00:59:45.823
the same ones that
shocked me half to death.

406
00:59:47.514 --> 00:59:50.276
[ominous music]

407
00:59:56.247 --> 00:59:58.422
The same ones that held me

408
01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:02.737
and the same ones that loved me.

409
01:00:10.676 --> 01:00:12.470
And it tore me apart.

410
01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:21.825
I couldn't kill one
without killing the other

411
01:00:21.859 --> 01:00:25.829
so I chose not to lose either.

412
01:00:28.521 --> 01:00:32.870
but it was too late.
I lost him anyway.

413
01:00:40.706 --> 01:00:42.500
And then he found you.

414
01:00:50.025 --> 01:00:51.924
[gentle music]

415
01:00:51.958 --> 01:00:55.997
He'll forgive you. you
know. but he won't forget.

416
01:00:58.516 --> 01:01:00.311
People forget. not him.

417
01:01:06.973 --> 01:01:09.562
[gentle music]

418
01:01:17.259 --> 01:01:19.745
Millie. can you do me a favor?

419
01:01:20.987 --> 01:01:21.816
- Yeah.

420
01:01:24.784 --> 01:01:26.199
- Look after him.

421
01:01:29.893 --> 01:01:31.791
- Of course. promise.

422
01:01:31.826 --> 01:01:34.449
[gentle music]

423
01:01:38.004 --> 01:01:41.180
- Is there anything
I can do for you?

424
01:01:43.251 --> 01:01:44.183
- You can give me some sleep.

425
01:01:49.050 --> 01:01:52.709
- I'll leave something behind
the mirror for you tomorrow.

426
01:01:52.743 --> 01:01:54.918
But take it in small doses.

427
01:01:56.816 --> 01:01:57.644
- Thanks.

428
01:02:03.754 --> 01:02:07.654
- I'm gonna make you
look so pretty tomorrow.

429
01:02:07.689 --> 01:02:09.449
I'll make sure of it.

430
01:02:17.216 --> 01:02:19.874
I'll turn the light off for you.

431
01:02:21.082 --> 01:02:22.083
- Night Zoe.

432
01:02:59.051 --> 01:03:01.950
[dark gentle music]

433
01:07:20.898 --> 01:07:22.072
- [Zoe] She's not waking up.

434
01:07:22.107 --> 01:07:23.039
- [Masked Man] What
did you give her?

435
01:07:23.073 --> 01:07:24.281
- [Zoe] Just a small bottle.

436
01:07:24.316 --> 01:07:26.766
I told her only to
take a small dose.

437
01:07:26.801 --> 01:07:29.286
- [Masked Man] An entire bottle?

438
01:07:29.321 --> 01:07:32.082
- [Zoe] She needed
help sleeping.

439
01:07:32.117 --> 01:07:34.015
- [Masked Man] Where
did you get it from?

440
01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:35.430
- [Zoe] The safe.

441
01:07:37.156 --> 01:07:38.019
- [Masked Man] This is it.

442
01:07:39.641 --> 01:07:41.954
If she doesn't wake up.
then neither will you.

443
01:07:43.818 --> 01:07:44.750
- She will.

444
01:07:46.510 --> 01:07:49.168
[ominous music]

445
01:08:59.583 --> 01:09:01.723
Millie. repeat after me.

446
01:09:03.725 --> 01:09:05.900
I take thee to be
my wedded husband.

447
01:09:07.212 --> 01:09:09.248
- I take thee to be
my wedded husband.

448
01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:15.565
- To have and to hold
from this day forward.

449
01:09:15.599 --> 01:09:18.533
- To have and to hold
from this day forward.

450
01:09:18.568 --> 01:09:21.260
- [Zoe] For better. for
worse. for richer. for poorer.

451
01:09:22.468 --> 01:09:24.988
- For better. for worse.
for richer. for poorer.

452
01:09:25.022 --> 01:09:26.783
- [Zoe] In sickness
and in health.

453
01:09:28.819 --> 01:09:30.304
- In sickness and in health.

454
01:09:34.825 --> 01:09:37.173
- To love.

455
01:09:37.207 --> 01:09:38.035
- To love.

456
01:09:40.762 --> 01:09:41.591
- To cherish.

457
01:09:44.318 --> 01:09:45.181
- To cherish.

458
01:09:47.079 --> 01:09:48.391
- [Zoe] To obey.

459
01:09:52.153 --> 01:09:52.981
- To obey.

460
01:09:55.501 --> 01:09:57.020
- Till death do us part.

461
01:09:58.987 --> 01:10:00.989
- Till death do us part.

462
01:10:30.295 --> 01:10:31.848
- You may now kiss the bride.

463
01:10:33.643 --> 01:10:36.232
[birds cawing]

464
01:11:38.604 --> 01:11:41.676
[heartbeat pounding]

465
01:12:24.788 --> 01:12:26.376
- You're not hungry?

466
01:12:26.411 --> 01:12:29.483
[heartbeat pounding]

467
01:12:37.387 --> 01:12:38.423
Well try it at least.

468
01:12:42.599 --> 01:12:43.566
- I'm fine. really.

469
01:12:52.437 --> 01:12:53.472
- Zoe made you a cake.

470
01:13:03.171 --> 01:13:05.726
The least you can do is try it.

471
01:13:13.561 --> 01:13:14.390
- Okay.

472
01:13:58.123 --> 01:14:01.091

[throwing up]

475
01:19:01.046 --> 01:19:02.220
- How much did you use?

476
01:19:02.254 --> 01:19:04.498
How much did you use?

477
01:19:04.532 --> 01:19:05.741
- How much of what?

478
01:19:05.775 --> 01:19:07.639
- How much did you
put in the cake?

479
01:19:07.673 --> 01:19:09.503
- I didn't make the cake.

480
01:19:09.537 --> 01:19:10.953
- [Millie] I did.

481
01:19:38.670 --> 01:19:40.258
- Stop!

482
01:19:40.292 --> 01:19:41.121
Stop!

483
01:19:49.198 --> 01:19:50.475
Stop.

484
01:19:50.509 --> 01:19:51.338
Stop.

485
01:19:52.201 --> 01:19:53.547
Please stop.

It's okay. it's okay.

Talk to me. talk to me.

491
01:20:33.207 --> 01:20:34.381
Okay.

492
01:20:34.415 --> 01:20:37.246
Talk to me. talk to me.

493
01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:39.213
Talk to me. talk to me.

494
01:20:40.663 --> 01:20:41.526
Talk to me.
