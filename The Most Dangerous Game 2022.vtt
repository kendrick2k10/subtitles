3
00:02:25.782 --> 00:02:26.715
- No.

4
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.552
- Checkmate.

5
00:02:28.587 --> 00:02:29.784
- Unbelievable.

6
00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.357
- Did you lose or win?

7
00:02:32.294 --> 00:02:33.623
- I lost.

8
00:02:33.658 --> 00:02:34.855
- Do you play the game?

9
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.593
- I do not play the game.

10
00:02:36.628 --> 00:02:37.891
- You do not play the game.

11
00:02:37.926 --> 00:02:39.365
- Can't you tell?

12
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.927
That's why I lost.
- I can tell.

13
00:02:40.962 --> 00:02:42.434
I mean. I like the way you
move the pieces around.

14
00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:44.931
but I mean. you're
actually playing a game?

15
00:02:44.966 --> 00:02:46.504
- I am doing my very best.

16
00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:48.737
- Oh my God. you did
poorly. trust me.

17
00:02:48.772 --> 00:02:50.838
- I think he
played the game.

18
00:02:50.873 --> 00:02:52.774
- And Marcus. let me
ask you a question.

19
00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:54.545
Would you say

20
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.009
that this whole location's
a little out of the way.

21
00:02:57.044 --> 00:02:58.714
even for you?

22
00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:00.287
- Well.

23
00:03:00.322 --> 00:03:01.915
If you're looking
for Kodiak bears.

24
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.587
there's only one place to go.

25
00:03:04.788 --> 00:03:06.953
- And you've said that before.

26
00:03:06.988 --> 00:03:09.890
but what I don't understand
is what makes 'em so special.

27
00:03:11.093 --> 00:03:15.896
- They can stand 10 feet tall.
weigh up to 1.500 pounds.

28
00:03:15.931 --> 00:03:17.898
run 30 miles an hour.

29
00:03:17.933 --> 00:03:20.868
climb any tree that
can hold their weight.

30
00:03:20.903 --> 00:03:24.740
they're not afraid of man.
and they like how we taste.

31
00:03:26.414 --> 00:03:27.743
- And do they have guns?

32
00:03:30.847 --> 00:03:32.352
- The bears?

33
00:03:32.387 --> 00:03:32.979
- Yeah.

34
00:03:33.014 --> 00:03:34.552
- Come on. Whit.

35
00:03:34.587 --> 00:03:36.323
What are you talking about?

36
00:03:36.358 --> 00:03:38.050
- Well. you want it to be
a fair fight. don't you?

37
00:03:38.085 --> 00:03:40.294
How's it a fair fight
if he's not armed?

38
00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.958
- Oh. oh. so. so an unarmed
man fighting a Kodiak bear

39
00:03:44.993 --> 00:03:45.926
is a fair fight?

40
00:03:46.895 --> 00:03:48.764
- It's a fight a hell
of a lot of people.

41
00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.062
including myself and you.

42
00:03:50.097 --> 00:03:51.866
would pay a lot
of bucks to watch.

43
00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:55.507
Even him with the tacky
sweater on would pay to see it.

44
00:03:55.542 --> 00:03:56.970
- My wife bought me this sweater

45
00:03:57.005 --> 00:03:59.478
and hunting is the best
sport in the world.

46
00:03:59.513 --> 00:04:01.843
- Well. for the hunter. for you.

47
00:04:01.878 --> 00:04:04.747
You enjoy hunting. you
enjoy that part of it

48
00:04:04.782 --> 00:04:06.386
when the bear's looking at you

49
00:04:06.421 --> 00:04:08.454
and you don't think
he feels pain.

50
00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.621
or you don't think he feels fear

51
00:04:10.656 --> 00:04:14.020
or any goddamn thing like that.
like every other human being

52
00:04:14.055 --> 00:04:16.759
or every other being
at all that's alive?

53
00:04:16.794 --> 00:04:19.960
- Look. you can humanize
the bear all you like.

54
00:04:19.995 --> 00:04:21.599
But at the end of the day.

55
00:04:21.634 --> 00:04:23.898
it's just looking at
us as their next meal.

56
00:04:23.933 --> 00:04:25.933
- Let me ask you a question.

57
00:04:25.968 --> 00:04:28.804
Are you trying to tell
me when you're armed

58
00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:32.346
and you're heading for a bear

59
00:04:32.381 --> 00:04:35.811
that he doesn't know
what you're up to?

60
00:04:35.846 --> 00:04:39.650
That he doesn't
know for a second

61
00:04:39.685 --> 00:04:43.753
that you might kill
him and take his life?

62
00:04:43.788 --> 00:04:48.791
- Whit. the Kodiak bear
is a cunning predator.

63
00:04:50.531 --> 00:04:51.827
an apex killer.

64
00:04:53.061 --> 00:04:56.898
but almost all of his
behavior is instinctual.

65
00:04:59.001 --> 00:05:00.671
The only circumstance
that might provide him

66
00:05:00.706 --> 00:05:02.838
with a. you know.
current lesson.

67
00:05:03.907 --> 00:05:05.445
mating season maybe.

68
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.105
- Mating season.

69
00:05:07.647 --> 00:05:08.613
I'll drink to that.

70
00:05:11.145 --> 00:05:12.012
- Okay.

71
00:05:13.983 --> 00:05:15.785
I'll drink to that.

72
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.424
but how many drinks have you
had while we're counting?

73
00:05:17.459 --> 00:05:18.986
- This is my very first one.

74
00:05:19.021 --> 00:05:20.922
- You
lying piece of shit.

75
00:05:20.957 --> 00:05:23.991
- And by the way. I
couldn't see your point earlier.

76
00:05:24.026 --> 00:05:25.399
- Sanger.

77
00:05:25.434 --> 00:05:26.059
Did we wake you?

78
00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:28.897
- No. Father. I'm okay.

79
00:05:28.932 --> 00:05:30.767
- Bad dreams?

80
00:05:30.802 --> 00:05:31.834
- No.

81
00:05:31.869 --> 00:05:33.407
Maybe.

82
00:05:33.442 --> 00:05:34.441
- How about a drink?

83
00:05:34.476 --> 00:05:35.805
- Yeah.

84
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.411
- I got an extra one
always on standby.

85
00:05:37.446 --> 00:05:38.071
- Okay. yeah.

86
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.912
So we past the island yet?

87
00:05:43.947 --> 00:05:44.946
- No. sir.

88
00:05:44.981 --> 00:05:45.782
- Soon.

89
00:05:48.853 --> 00:05:51.755
- What is it about this island
that's got you all nervous?

90
00:05:52.857 --> 00:05:55.561
- Its reputation. bad one.

91
00:05:55.596 --> 00:05:57.431
- It's mostly rumor
and superstition.

92
00:05:59.028 --> 00:06:00.599
- Does anybody notice

93
00:06:00.634 --> 00:06:01.798
how the captain's
nerves have been shaky

94
00:06:01.833 --> 00:06:03.129
while on this voyage?

95
00:06:03.164 --> 00:06:04.702
Saw the charts we drew up

96
00:06:04.737 --> 00:06:06.099
and he knew where
we're headed wasn't

97
00:06:06.134 --> 00:06:07.474
for the faint of heart.

98
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.477
- Don't question this
captain's courage.

99
00:06:11.942 --> 00:06:13.810
I know he seems
like an old prick

100
00:06:13.845 --> 00:06:16.681
and he doesn't know what he's
doing and he may be afraid.

101
00:06:16.716 --> 00:06:19.046
but even afraid. he'd go
right up to the devil.

102
00:06:19.081 --> 00:06:23.919
look him in the eye. and
say. "Give me a light. bud."

103
00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:26.757
That's who he is.

104
00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.925
- Captain was acting
a bit funny earlier.

105
00:06:31.027 --> 00:06:32.466
Some of the crew as well.

106
00:06:33.964 --> 00:06:35.469
He is afraid of something.

107
00:06:36.934 --> 00:06:39.066
- Probably rumor
masquerading as fact.

108
00:06:41.004 --> 00:06:43.576
- No. I felt it.

109
00:06:44.975 --> 00:06:46.678
I was out on the rail earlier.

110
00:06:47.615 --> 00:06:48.845
There was no breeze.

111
00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:54.950
As if there was a poisonous
sensation in the air.

112
00:06:56.591 --> 00:06:59.053
chill and wet feeling
that stuck to me.

113
00:06:59.088 --> 00:07:01.792
- Well. buy a fucking
coat. Jesus Christ.

114
00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:03.794
You're shit-faced.

115
00:07:03.829 --> 00:07:05.895
- No.
- Oh. you're shit-faced.

116
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:06.995
Oh. come on.

117
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:08.733
- No. first one. first drink.

118
00:07:08.768 --> 00:07:10.262
- Go to nappy's house.

119
00:07:10.297 --> 00:07:11.098
- Okay.

120
00:07:25.147 --> 00:07:27.048
- Mr. Rainsford.
- Captain.

121
00:07:27.083 --> 00:07:30.051
- We've sounded two horns for
we're about in the bottleneck.

122
00:07:30.086 --> 00:07:31.921
- Bottleneck?

123
00:07:31.956 --> 00:07:34.022
- That's right. The only way
to go at it from this way is

124
00:07:34.057 --> 00:07:37.058
to come close to the island.

125
00:07:37.093 --> 00:07:39.830
sliding through the
bottleneck between the island

126
00:07:39.865 --> 00:07:42.965
and a large reef.
shoals all around.

127
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.606
We've slowed to a crawl.

128
00:07:46.641 --> 00:07:48.102
In 30 minutes. it'll be
the shallows of the island

129
00:07:48.137 --> 00:07:50.775
to the left and nothing
but reef to the right.

130
00:07:51.911 --> 00:07:55.879
The island's beaches will
be no more than 100 meters

131
00:07:55.914 --> 00:07:59.784
from our port side. so if you
believe in a God. gentlemen.

132
00:08:01.117 --> 00:08:01.984
start praying to him.

133
00:08:03.152 --> 00:08:05.922
- Thank you.
- Thank you. captain.

134
00:08:05.957 --> 00:08:07.253
- Thank you.

135
00:08:10.291 --> 00:08:13.699
- There's still time to turn
the boat and go around. sir.

136
00:08:13.734 --> 00:08:15.327
- We already had
this discussion.

137
00:08:15.362 --> 00:08:17.967
We don't have the three
days to go around the island

138
00:08:18.002 --> 00:08:22.037
and I'm not gonna let
superstition rule the day.

139
00:08:22.072 --> 00:08:23.577
Thank you.

140
00:08:23.612 --> 00:08:25.810
- I hope the hunt is
worth it. Mr. Rainsford.

141
00:08:31.147 --> 00:08:32.553
- He's lost his nerve.

142
00:08:33.853 --> 00:08:35.182
- Like I said.

143
00:08:35.217 --> 00:08:37.052
Hey. Sanger. you
find God in that war?

144
00:08:38.088 --> 00:08:39.725
- No. sir.

145
00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.056
God left us to die there.

146
00:08:44.292 --> 00:08:45.225
I'm going back to bed.

147
00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:46.325
- Sanger. one second.

148
00:08:48.802 --> 00:08:52.837
Throughout history. men have
done horrible things to men

149
00:08:52.872 --> 00:08:54.168
for a myriad of reasons.

150
00:08:55.875 --> 00:09:00.647
Do not let your war
experience control

151
00:09:00.682 --> 00:09:02.077
your whole life afterwards.

152
00:09:03.718 --> 00:09:05.685
The war is over. Sanger.

153
00:09:06.688 --> 00:09:07.588
Do you understand?

154
00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.220
- I appreciate the
effort. Father.

155
00:09:13.255 --> 00:09:14.089
I do.

156
00:09:16.797 --> 00:09:17.598
- Get some rest.

157
00:09:18.293 --> 00:09:19.633
Tomorrow's a big day.

158
00:09:22.935 --> 00:09:25.034
- Good
night. gentlemen.

159
00:09:25.069 --> 00:09:25.969
- Good night. son.

160
00:09:34.309 --> 00:09:35.880
- He'll be okay. Marcus.

161
00:09:35.915 --> 00:09:37.376
This trip will be good for him.

162
00:09:37.411 --> 00:09:38.311
- Yeah.

163
00:09:38.346 --> 00:09:41.149
Well. we shall see.

164
00:09:41.184 --> 00:09:42.117
- You'll see.

165
00:11:50.412 --> 00:11:52.214
- Sanger?

166
00:11:52.249 --> 00:11:53.182
Sanger!

167
00:11:53.217 --> 00:11:54.986
Oh. my boy. oh my God.

168
00:11:55.923 --> 00:11:57.186
Thought you were lost to me.

169
00:11:57.221 --> 00:11:58.352
Oh. my boy. my boy.

170
00:11:58.387 --> 00:11:59.859
Are you okay. are you okay?

171
00:11:59.894 --> 00:12:02.257
- I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

172
00:12:05.295 --> 00:12:06.558
What happened?

173
00:12:06.593 --> 00:12:08.395
- My best guess is
the boiler blew.

174
00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:10.397
Only thing that makes sense
in this kind of situation.

175
00:12:10.432 --> 00:12:12.003
- No. no. no. no. no. no.

176
00:12:12.038 --> 00:12:13.367
No. that doesn't make
any sense at all.

177
00:12:13.402 --> 00:12:14.434
There's no way the
captain hires people

178
00:12:14.469 --> 00:12:15.534
that can't maintain his boiler.

179
00:12:15.569 --> 00:12:17.140
It's gotta be something else.

180
00:12:17.175 --> 00:12:18.207
- Well. I'm at
a loss then. Marcus.

181
00:12:18.242 --> 00:12:19.538
because the only thing on a ship

182
00:12:19.573 --> 00:12:20.913
that should explode like
that is the boilers.

183
00:12:22.378 --> 00:12:24.114
- Captain Nielsen. where is he?

184
00:12:25.854 --> 00:12:27.414
Wait. Whit?

185
00:12:29.891 --> 00:12:31.286
- Drowned.

186
00:12:31.321 --> 00:12:32.188
Right next to me.

187
00:12:35.226 --> 00:12:37.160
- We don't know how long
we're gonna be here.

188
00:12:37.195 --> 00:12:39.327
We have to see what we
could salvage from the ship.

189
00:12:39.362 --> 00:12:43.067
Okay. we're gonna need
food stuff. fresh water.

190
00:12:43.102 --> 00:12:45.300
Okay. we're gonna need anything
we can use to build a fire.

191
00:12:45.335 --> 00:12:46.906
to maintain the fire.

192
00:12:46.941 --> 00:12:48.369
Maybe something we could
build a shelter out of.

193
00:12:48.404 --> 00:12:50.041
We need some rope

194
00:12:50.076 --> 00:12:51.405
and any sharp edged
instrument we can find.

195
00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.307
Okay. ready?

196
00:12:53.376 --> 00:12:54.408
Okay?

197
00:12:54.443 --> 00:12:55.442
- This is it. isn't it. Marcus?

198
00:12:55.477 --> 00:12:56.311
- Ah.

199
00:12:57.347 --> 00:12:59.083
Yes. this is it.

200
00:12:59.118 --> 00:13:01.514
- Well. maybe superstition
isn't so unbelievable after all.

201
00:13:01.549 --> 00:13:04.055
- Well. superstition
didn't blow up the boat.

202
00:13:06.521 --> 00:13:09.159
- There may be more survivors.

203
00:13:09.194 --> 00:13:10.996
- Okay. who is there?

204
00:13:11.031 --> 00:13:14.329
The three of us and Whitney.
the captain. four crewmen.

205
00:13:16.465 --> 00:13:18.498
- Two of the crew are dead.

206
00:13:18.533 --> 00:13:19.499
- How do you know that?

207
00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:23.338
- They washed on
the shore with me.

208
00:13:24.407 --> 00:13:25.241
- Damn.

209
00:13:30.545 --> 00:13:31.478
Marcus?

210
00:13:31.513 --> 00:13:32.919
- Yes. that was a rifle.

211
00:13:33.614 --> 00:13:35.053
Sounded like a...

212
00:13:35.088 --> 00:13:35.988
- A Mazda.

213
00:13:36.023 --> 00:13:37.286
- A Mazda. that's right.

214
00:13:37.321 --> 00:13:38.320
Well. that means there's
someone else here.

215
00:13:38.355 --> 00:13:39.486
This is good news.

216
00:13:40.687 --> 00:13:42.357
- Sure about that. Father?

217
00:13:42.392 --> 00:13:43.963
- Yeah.

218
00:13:43.998 --> 00:13:45.965
We're at the edge of the
Aleutian Territory. son.

219
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.329
There's nobody out here.

220
00:13:47.364 --> 00:13:48.902
The fact we heard
another rifle means

221
00:13:48.937 --> 00:13:51.069
there's gotta be
another hunter. right?

222
00:13:52.974 --> 00:13:54.303
This is good.
there'll be a camp.

223
00:13:54.338 --> 00:13:57.405
there'll be food.
there'll be dry clothes.

224
00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.011
- Maybe there's a plane.

225
00:13:59.046 --> 00:14:00.111
Maybe there's a landing
strip somewhere.

226
00:14:00.146 --> 00:14:01.508
- That's right.

227
00:14:01.543 --> 00:14:04.049
- That rifle shot was
about a mile away.

228
00:14:04.084 --> 00:14:06.414
- You know. that rifle shot
was about half a mile away.

229
00:14:06.449 --> 00:14:07.547
We'd better go.

230
00:14:07.582 --> 00:14:08.614
Come on. come on. let's go.

231
00:14:08.649 --> 00:14:10.550
Let's go to the sound. come on.

232
00:14:10.585 --> 00:14:12.387
Come on. Sanger. we can do this.

233
00:14:12.422 --> 00:14:14.389
We can do it. Sanger.
we've got this.

234
00:14:45.323 --> 00:14:46.421
Something's been shot.

235
00:14:55.102 --> 00:14:56.497
- 7.9 millimeter.

236
00:14:58.237 --> 00:14:59.071
- Wowza.

237
00:15:01.174 --> 00:15:02.338
- What are they hunting?

238
00:15:03.506 --> 00:15:05.308
- Okay.

239
00:15:05.343 --> 00:15:06.672
Keep your eyes open.

240
00:15:06.707 --> 00:15:07.541
Pay attention.

241
00:15:30.632 --> 00:15:31.466
Oh.

242
00:15:34.108 --> 00:15:34.733
Civilization.

243
00:15:43.414 --> 00:15:44.479
- Not savages then.

244
00:15:45.548 --> 00:15:46.382
Good.

245
00:15:47.051 --> 00:15:49.055
I was beginning to get worried.

246
00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:51.486
- Oh. Rex. I didn't think
you were scared of anything.

247
00:15:52.522 --> 00:15:54.621
- Scared of my wife.

248
00:15:54.656 --> 00:15:56.557
She wants me back
home in one piece.

249
00:15:56.592 --> 00:15:57.492
- Okay.

250
00:16:00.365 --> 00:16:02.497
Let's see if we can get
off this island. huh?

251
00:16:25.522 --> 00:16:27.621
All right. they've got fire.

252
00:16:27.656 --> 00:16:30.195
- Okay. so you're right
again. they're not savages.

253
00:16:31.495 --> 00:16:32.626
Jesus!

254
00:16:35.631 --> 00:16:36.465
- Oh.

255
00:16:37.336 --> 00:16:38.731
We mean you no harm.

256
00:16:38.766 --> 00:16:39.699
We are unarmed.

257
00:16:41.538 --> 00:16:44.143
Our ship sank last night.

258
00:16:44.178 --> 00:16:47.179
We are marooned on your island?

259
00:16:48.743 --> 00:16:51.348
This is my friend. Rex Alan.

260
00:16:52.681 --> 00:16:53.746
That's my son Sanger.

261
00:16:53.781 --> 00:16:55.352
I am Marcus Rainsford.

262
00:16:58.291 --> 00:16:59.125
You are?

263
00:17:07.597 --> 00:17:08.431
- Welcome.

264
00:17:09.764 --> 00:17:11.236
I must assume you
are the survivors

265
00:17:11.271 --> 00:17:12.402
of the boat I
heard have a mishap

266
00:17:12.437 --> 00:17:13.568
in the middle of the night.

267
00:17:13.603 --> 00:17:14.602
- Yes.

268
00:17:14.637 --> 00:17:15.801
Yes. we are.

269
00:17:15.836 --> 00:17:17.572
- Please excuse Ivan there.

270
00:17:19.312 --> 00:17:20.146
He is a mute.

271
00:17:21.545 --> 00:17:23.545
And also deaf quite
a bit of the time.

272
00:17:25.483 --> 00:17:26.416
You must be hungry.

273
00:17:28.882 --> 00:17:30.486
Ivan will show you

274
00:17:30.521 --> 00:17:32.224
to what I hope will be
acceptable quarters.

275
00:17:32.259 --> 00:17:35.491
And we will discuss your
dilemma over dinner after a bit.

276
00:17:35.526 --> 00:17:37.163
- Thank you.

277
00:17:37.198 --> 00:17:39.495
- Most certainly I will
be able to help you.

278
00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:40.364
Excuse me.

279
00:17:50.706 --> 00:17:52.244
- You guys okay?

280
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.304
Oh.

281
00:18:19.339 --> 00:18:21.141
- Isn't exactly
the Waldorf. is it?

282
00:18:23.211 --> 00:18:25.772
- This place is fine until
we get off the island. okay?

283
00:18:26.742 --> 00:18:28.445
- How you doing?

284
00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.777
- Something about this
place doesn't feel right.

285
00:18:30.812 --> 00:18:33.285
- So. what give it away for you?

286
00:18:34.288 --> 00:18:36.717
Frankenstein out there
or the casual demeanor

287
00:18:36.752 --> 00:18:38.917
in which our host
accepted us in?

288
00:18:38.952 --> 00:18:41.491
- Let's prepare for dinner.

289
00:19:05.385 --> 00:19:07.550
This is a beautiful moose.

290
00:19:11.424 --> 00:19:13.655
Should be hung on the wall.

291
00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:16.295
- Must have taken a few
shots to bring it down.

292
00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.826
- Yes. it was quite the task.

293
00:19:21.027 --> 00:19:23.434
- Did he charge you?

294
00:19:24.833 --> 00:19:27.966
- Held me against the
tree. fractured my skull.

295
00:19:28.001 --> 00:19:29.902
But at last. at
the end of the day.

296
00:19:29.937 --> 00:19:32.311
I proclaimed to be the victor.

297
00:19:32.346 --> 00:19:34.005
- Well. the moose is
a formidable opponent

298
00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.446
during mating season.

299
00:19:36.878 --> 00:19:40.517
but the most dangerous is
the Cape Water Buffalo.

300
00:19:40.552 --> 00:19:43.784
- Here at my preserve. I hunt
even more dangerous game.

301
00:19:43.819 --> 00:19:45.621
- No.

302
00:19:45.656 --> 00:19:48.492
- You have big game
here on the island?

303
00:19:48.527 --> 00:19:49.691
- The most dangerous.

304
00:19:50.628 --> 00:19:52.826
- Huh. isn't that a coincidence?

305
00:19:52.861 --> 00:19:54.498
- What could that be?

306
00:19:54.533 --> 00:19:55.796
- It's not here
naturally. of course.

307
00:19:55.831 --> 00:19:57.402
I have to stock the island.

308
00:19:57.437 --> 00:19:58.271
- Of course.

309
00:19:59.736 --> 00:20:02.407
- Please. sir. let
me introduce myself.

310
00:20:02.442 --> 00:20:03.936
I'm Baron Carl Von Wolf.

311
00:20:03.971 --> 00:20:05.003
- And I'm Marcus-

312
00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:06.906
- You need no introduction. sir.

313
00:20:06.941 --> 00:20:08.611
I have read all of your books.

314
00:20:08.646 --> 00:20:10.316
I know of your adventures.

315
00:20:10.351 --> 00:20:11.647
I too am a hunter.

316
00:20:11.682 --> 00:20:12.483
- Yes.

317
00:20:13.915 --> 00:20:15.618
- Where are my manners?

318
00:20:15.653 --> 00:20:17.653
Please. shall we sit.
drink wine. eat good food?

319
00:20:17.688 --> 00:20:20.590
You all deserve a bit of
conversation and relaxation.

320
00:20:20.625 --> 00:20:22.592
- Uh. I don't mind if I do.

321
00:20:22.627 --> 00:20:23.659
- After you.

322
00:20:23.694 --> 00:20:24.759
- Thank you. Baron.

323
00:20:32.604 --> 00:20:34.802
Baron. what is the animal

324
00:20:34.837 --> 00:20:36.870
that you have imported
here to your island?

325
00:20:36.905 --> 00:20:38.608
Lions. tigers?

326
00:20:40.381 --> 00:20:44.515
- I'm afraid tigers ceased to
interest me a long time ago.

327
00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:47.617
They would not survive in
this climate. I might add.

328
00:20:47.652 --> 00:20:49.751
However. I exhausted their
possibilities. you see.

329
00:20:49.786 --> 00:20:53.392
There was no real thrill
there. no real danger.

330
00:20:53.427 --> 00:20:55.922
And I'm afraid
danger is something

331
00:20:55.957 --> 00:20:57.528
that has been forged into me.

332
00:20:57.563 --> 00:20:59.057
Maybe because of my
military background.

333
00:21:00.533 --> 00:21:03.633
I am familiar with the
New Yorker. Rex Allen.

334
00:21:04.603 --> 00:21:06.064
if I'm not mistaken.

335
00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:07.769
- You are correct. sir.

336
00:21:09.476 --> 00:21:11.806
- You made your riches
in stocks. I believe.

337
00:21:13.513 --> 00:21:15.579
I've once read in
one of your stories

338
00:21:15.614 --> 00:21:19.044
about you taking down a mighty
elk with a muzzle loader.

339
00:21:19.079 --> 00:21:22.916
coincidentally in your own home
state. if I'm not mistaken.

340
00:21:22.951 --> 00:21:24.786
- You are correct. sir.

341
00:21:24.821 --> 00:21:25.688
- Impressive.

342
00:21:26.625 --> 00:21:27.459
You.

343
00:21:29.892 --> 00:21:32.431
I have no idea of your exploits.

344
00:21:33.863 --> 00:21:36.699
- I don't have any.

345
00:21:36.734 --> 00:21:38.602
- Nonsense.

346
00:21:38.637 --> 00:21:41.869
My son Sanger is a
decorated war hero.

347
00:21:41.904 --> 00:21:42.936
- Is that so?

348
00:21:42.971 --> 00:21:43.772
- Father.

349
00:21:45.446 --> 00:21:46.940
I'd rather not talk about it.

350
00:21:49.483 --> 00:21:51.450
- Never be afraid of the
things that you have done

351
00:21:51.485 --> 00:21:52.616
in this life. Sanger.

352
00:21:53.718 --> 00:21:54.783
They're what define us.

353
00:21:54.818 --> 00:21:56.719
That is something to embrace.

354
00:21:56.754 --> 00:21:57.555
- Well said.

355
00:22:03.992 --> 00:22:06.894
- I am most glad to
have your company here.

356
00:22:06.929 --> 00:22:08.467
although I am terribly sorry

357
00:22:08.502 --> 00:22:10.832
that it's under such
sad circumstances.

358
00:22:10.867 --> 00:22:13.439
- Yes. we lost a
very good friend.

359
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.936
- The whole crew too.

360
00:22:15.971 --> 00:22:17.443
It's all a damn shame.

361
00:22:20.811 --> 00:22:22.877
- We still have three
people unaccounted for.

362
00:22:24.518 --> 00:22:26.551
And yeah. it's terrible.

363
00:22:28.049 --> 00:22:29.114
Life lost for no reason.

364
00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.055
- I have a ship.

365
00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:39.696
It is off island for
another several days.

366
00:22:39.731 --> 00:22:40.862
getting supplies. you see.

367
00:22:42.096 --> 00:22:44.899
When it returns. you
shall all voyage home.

368
00:22:45.902 --> 00:22:46.967
- Thank you. Baron.

369
00:22:47.002 --> 00:22:48.001
Very gracious.

370
00:22:49.741 --> 00:22:50.641
- That's good news.

371
00:22:52.007 --> 00:22:53.578
- Baron. you were speaking

372
00:22:53.613 --> 00:22:55.206
of the game here on
the island earlier.

373
00:22:55.241 --> 00:22:58.880
- Yes. well. we shall all
hunt while you are here. no?

374
00:22:58.915 --> 00:23:00.750
You will be amused. I think.

375
00:23:00.785 --> 00:23:02.686
I've done a rare thing.

376
00:23:02.721 --> 00:23:05.216
I have invented a new sensation.

377
00:23:05.251 --> 00:23:06.657
Ivan. more port.

378
00:23:09.695 --> 00:23:12.124
- You don't happen to have
any whiskey there. do you?

379
00:23:14.128 --> 00:23:17.195
Okay. all right.
just thought I'd ask.

380
00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:18.636
Take it easy. big fella.

381
00:23:21.872 --> 00:23:23.938
- Port makes some men
poets. Mr. Rainsford.

382
00:23:25.238 --> 00:23:29.042
Some it makes
kings. some beggers.

383
00:23:29.077 --> 00:23:30.208
He made us hunters. didn't he?

384
00:23:30.243 --> 00:23:31.110
- Yes. he did.

385
00:23:32.718 --> 00:23:36.555
- This hand was made for
the trigger. my father said.

386
00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:38.018
He was a very rich man.

387
00:23:38.053 --> 00:23:40.658
He owned a quarter of a
million acres in Poland.

388
00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:43.221
When I was five.

389
00:23:44.895 --> 00:23:47.060
he gave me a little gun
to shoot sparrows with.

390
00:23:48.329 --> 00:23:52.967
When I shot his prize turkeys
instead. he did not punish me.

391
00:23:53.002 --> 00:23:54.672
No.

392
00:23:54.707 --> 00:23:57.807
Instead he complimented
me on my marksmanship.

393
00:23:58.876 --> 00:24:01.547
My whole life has
been one prolonged hunt.

394
00:24:03.012 --> 00:24:05.012
I mean. I've been into the
army as what was expected

395
00:24:05.047 --> 00:24:06.882
from an nobleman's son.

396
00:24:06.917 --> 00:24:10.083
And for a time I commanded a
division of men that. well.

397
00:24:10.118 --> 00:24:13.218
later we be referred
to as the Wolf Pack.

398
00:24:13.253 --> 00:24:17.728
But my real interest
was always the hunt.

399
00:24:19.699 --> 00:24:22.931
- Baron. excuse me if
I'm off the mark here.

400
00:24:22.966 --> 00:24:27.001
but I'd wager a bet
you're from Germany?

401
00:24:28.268 --> 00:24:30.268
- I left the country
for it was imprudent

402
00:24:30.303 --> 00:24:32.072
for an officer of the
Reich to stay there.

403
00:24:32.107 --> 00:24:35.108
especially as myself
never cared much for war

404
00:24:35.143 --> 00:24:36.076
nor the man leading it.

405
00:24:39.081 --> 00:24:40.652
Many lost everything.

406
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:47.593
Luckily. I had invested
heavily in American securities.

407
00:24:48.761 --> 00:24:50.860
So naturally. I
continued my hunt.

408
00:24:50.895 --> 00:24:54.831
Crocodiles in the Ganges.
rhinoceros in East Africa.

409
00:24:54.866 --> 00:24:57.933
And eventually I left
to hunt the famed jaguar

410
00:24:58.804 --> 00:25:00.298
in the infamous Amazon.

411
00:25:01.267 --> 00:25:03.169
It was a creature of
great disappointment.

412
00:25:03.204 --> 00:25:04.841
- What?

413
00:25:04.876 --> 00:25:07.140
The jaguar is the most
revered cat there is.

414
00:25:08.649 --> 00:25:09.714
- I assure you. sir.

415
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:13.817
there is nothing interesting
about the hunt of the jaguar.

416
00:25:13.852 --> 00:25:15.753
a dumb animal. really.

417
00:25:15.788 --> 00:25:17.656
- I'm sorry about
Rex's outburst.

418
00:25:17.691 --> 00:25:21.825
but he has been desperate
to hunt the jaguar

419
00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:23.893
for probably 10 years now.

420
00:25:23.928 --> 00:25:26.192
- I will offer a
better alternative.

421
00:25:26.227 --> 00:25:27.259
I can assure you of that.

422
00:25:27.294 --> 00:25:29.129
- Oh yeah. right. of course.

423
00:25:29.164 --> 00:25:31.131
probably the secret beast you
have somewhere hidden here

424
00:25:31.166 --> 00:25:32.836
on your wretched island. right?

425
00:25:32.871 --> 00:25:34.299
- Rex.
- Sanger.

426
00:25:34.334 --> 00:25:36.609
You've been strangely quiet.

427
00:25:37.711 --> 00:25:39.073
- I'm just listening. Father.

428
00:25:41.308 --> 00:25:42.241
- Observation.

429
00:25:44.113 --> 00:25:46.619
A trait from the war. I gather.

430
00:25:46.654 --> 00:25:48.115
- A trait any man
should acquire.

431
00:25:51.021 --> 00:25:52.086
- If only they all did.

432
00:25:53.793 --> 00:25:55.793
What was your
speciality. Sanger?

433
00:25:55.828 --> 00:25:57.091
In the war. I mean.

434
00:25:57.126 --> 00:25:58.125
- I was a marksman.

435
00:25:59.194 --> 00:26:00.666
- Have you hunted much?

436
00:26:00.701 --> 00:26:02.063
- No.

437
00:26:02.098 --> 00:26:03.966
That's why I invited him
to join us on this trip.

438
00:26:04.001 --> 00:26:06.166
- The kid's a crack
shot from 500 yards.

439
00:26:06.201 --> 00:26:08.267
Beats me on my best day.

440
00:26:08.302 --> 00:26:09.103
- Thousand.

441
00:26:09.974 --> 00:26:10.775
- Huh?

442
00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:11.644
- Pardon?

443
00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.108
- Thousand yards
is my best shot.

444
00:26:25.385 --> 00:26:26.692
There we are.

445
00:27:02.092 --> 00:27:04.895
- There is no greater
bore than perfection.

446
00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:05.896
is there. Sanger?

447
00:27:09.198 --> 00:27:12.232
See. I became the
perfect hunter.

448
00:27:13.202 --> 00:27:14.300
No quarry could match me.

449
00:27:14.335 --> 00:27:17.875
No animal stood a chance.

450
00:27:20.748 --> 00:27:23.441
Boredom found me very easily.

451
00:27:26.479 --> 00:27:30.349
Then one day. it
just came to me.

452
00:27:31.858 --> 00:27:32.450
- What did?

453
00:27:35.356 --> 00:27:37.829
- I had to invent
something new to hunt.

454
00:27:39.932 --> 00:27:43.769
This island is a
perfect preserve.

455
00:27:45.234 --> 00:27:50.237
Trees. streams.
hills. mountains.

456
00:27:54.848 --> 00:27:59.015
I had to hunt something
that had courage. cunning.

457
00:28:00.414 --> 00:28:04.284
and above all else. it
had to be able to reason.

458
00:28:05.958 --> 00:28:07.859
- No animal can reason.

459
00:28:11.425 --> 00:28:12.259
- There is but one.

460
00:28:16.067 --> 00:28:17.066
- Not man.

461
00:28:17.904 --> 00:28:19.101
That's murderous.

462
00:28:21.171 --> 00:28:25.470
- I refuse to believe that
such modern and civilized men

463
00:28:27.408 --> 00:28:32.411
would have romantic ideals
about the value of human life.

464
00:28:35.955 --> 00:28:40.958
Especially one such as yourself
that tasted it. felt it.

465
00:28:44.392 --> 00:28:45.391
- War is war.

466
00:28:47.065 --> 00:28:48.328
It didn't make me a murderer.

467
00:28:50.134 --> 00:28:51.001
- No. boy.

468
00:28:52.466 --> 00:28:53.839
It made you a hunter.

469
00:28:55.502 --> 00:28:58.074
- This is some kind
of sick joke. right?

470
00:28:59.473 --> 00:29:01.814
- I do not joke about my hunts.

471
00:29:01.849 --> 00:29:05.279
- Baron. if what you
are saying is serious.

472
00:29:05.314 --> 00:29:08.084
then this is murder.

473
00:29:08.988 --> 00:29:10.086
- That word again.

474
00:29:15.324 --> 00:29:18.226
I would wager that you
will forget that notion

475
00:29:18.261 --> 00:29:19.997
once you go hunting with me.

476
00:29:20.032 --> 00:29:23.297
You will have a genuine
thrill in store for you.

477
00:29:23.332 --> 00:29:25.299
Correct me if I
am wrong. Sanger.

478
00:29:25.334 --> 00:29:29.303
but there is no hunting
like the hunting of man.

479
00:29:29.338 --> 00:29:31.844
Those who have hunted
armed men for long enough

480
00:29:31.879 --> 00:29:35.441
and liked it never cared for
anything else thereafter.

481
00:29:37.247 --> 00:29:39.379
- I've never found pleasure
in taking any life.

482
00:29:41.449 --> 00:29:44.087
Never mind another person's.

483
00:29:44.122 --> 00:29:46.320
- This is barbarism.

484
00:29:47.422 --> 00:29:49.290
- It's all a joke.

485
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:52.997
The old Baron here is
just trying to scare us

486
00:29:53.032 --> 00:29:55.967
with some of his
German fear tactics.

487
00:29:56.970 --> 00:30:00.400
- Your American humor is
beginning to unnerve me.

488
00:30:03.372 --> 00:30:08.342
Life is for the strong.
to be lived by the strong.

489
00:30:09.983 --> 00:30:12.984
And it may be taken
by the strong.

490
00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.218
The weak of the
fold were put here

491
00:30:16.253 --> 00:30:17.351
for the strong's pleasure.

492
00:30:17.386 --> 00:30:18.924
And I am strong.

493
00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:23.027
I survived the war. even
though my people lost.

494
00:30:27.396 --> 00:30:30.100
Why should I not be
able to use my gift?

495
00:30:30.135 --> 00:30:32.938
If I wish to hunt.

496
00:30:32.973 --> 00:30:36.172
why should I not be able
to continue to do so?

497
00:30:36.207 --> 00:30:37.239
- Because they're human.

498
00:30:37.274 --> 00:30:38.537
- Precisely.

499
00:30:41.542 --> 00:30:43.311
Men can reason.

500
00:30:47.482 --> 00:30:50.318
That makes them a
worthy adversary.

501
00:30:50.353 --> 00:30:51.957
That makes them dangerous.

502
00:30:53.455 --> 00:30:54.388
- A worthy adversary?

503
00:30:57.063 --> 00:31:00.361
Tell me. Baron. were
they worthy adversaries

504
00:31:00.396 --> 00:31:02.429
when you locked us
up in the camps?

505
00:31:02.464 --> 00:31:04.530
- I was against that.

506
00:31:04.565 --> 00:31:06.466
The camps were a waste of time.

507
00:31:06.501 --> 00:31:10.107
They cost too much money and
were a waste of resources.

508
00:31:10.142 --> 00:31:14.606
- Where do these
lost souls come from?

509
00:31:14.641 --> 00:31:16.575
- How did you get
here. Mr. Rainsford?

510
00:31:19.085 --> 00:31:21.151
It's a small channel.

511
00:31:21.186 --> 00:31:25.551
It is just small enough.
yet just deep enough

512
00:31:25.586 --> 00:31:28.455
that sea mines prove
an effective tool

513
00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:30.160
against unsuspecting ships.

514
00:31:30.195 --> 00:31:31.524
- You blew us up.

515
00:31:31.559 --> 00:31:33.999
- I created the event
that got you here. yeah.

516
00:31:34.034 --> 00:31:37.563
but I had no way of knowing
who's on board the vessel.

517
00:31:37.598 --> 00:31:39.631
It is by sheer coincidence
that you are here

518
00:31:39.666 --> 00:31:42.106
and much to my delight.

519
00:31:42.141 --> 00:31:45.472
So we go hunting tomorrow. yes?

520
00:31:45.507 --> 00:31:46.539
- No.

521
00:31:46.574 --> 00:31:48.211
- Hell no.

522
00:31:48.246 --> 00:31:50.708
- We are not going to
participate whatsoever

523
00:31:50.743 --> 00:31:52.083
in your murder hunt.

524
00:31:54.252 --> 00:31:55.284
- Hypocrites!

525
00:32:10.631 --> 00:32:12.367
A fresh kill from this morning.

526
00:32:13.733 --> 00:32:15.172
Took three shots.

527
00:32:16.571 --> 00:32:18.109
The first two wounded him.

528
00:32:19.508 --> 00:32:21.739
the third made him close
his eyes for the final time.

529
00:32:24.282 --> 00:32:26.645
He will make an adequate
addition to my collection.

530
00:32:28.616 --> 00:32:29.483
- Your collection?

531
00:32:34.622 --> 00:32:35.654
- Jesus Christ.

532
00:32:42.366 --> 00:32:43.497
- There's a game. you see.

533
00:32:45.237 --> 00:32:50.207
I give them supplies. food.
an excellent hunting knife.

534
00:32:51.375 --> 00:32:53.507
They get three
hours of start time.

535
00:32:54.376 --> 00:32:57.346
I follow. armed
only with my rifle.

536
00:32:59.251 --> 00:33:02.648
If my quarry eludes me
for three whole days.

537
00:33:02.683 --> 00:33:03.517
they win the game.

538
00:33:05.422 --> 00:33:08.489
If I find them. he loses.

539
00:33:09.358 --> 00:33:12.163
- Okay. and suppose
they refuse to hunt?

540
00:33:13.562 --> 00:33:16.299
- Ivan's torturous methods
are quite unbearable.

541
00:33:17.566 --> 00:33:20.237
It is his own idea of sport.

542
00:33:21.636 --> 00:33:24.802
Those who have refused
have never survived longer

543
00:33:24.837 --> 00:33:27.805
than a night in his care.

544
00:33:28.707 --> 00:33:31.512
And although to date.
I have not lost.

545
00:33:32.548 --> 00:33:36.088
and only on one occasion did
my quarry choose an ending

546
00:33:36.123 --> 00:33:38.321
of the suicidal variety.

547
00:33:38.356 --> 00:33:39.652
The coward. shamefully.

548
00:33:39.687 --> 00:33:43.392
He seemed like a
worthy opponent.

549
00:33:44.659 --> 00:33:47.528
- Yes. well. Baron. I'm sorry.

550
00:33:47.563 --> 00:33:50.696
but we are not going to
participate in your murder hunt.

551
00:34:06.879 --> 00:34:08.252
- Be quick.

552
00:34:08.287 --> 00:34:09.385
- Father.
- Please go.

553
00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:10.716
- Father.
- Be quiet.

554
00:34:11.818 --> 00:34:13.587
You are a Rainsford.

555
00:34:23.665 --> 00:34:25.269
- Apologies. my boy.

556
00:34:26.503 --> 00:34:27.601
But they refused.

557
00:34:28.637 --> 00:34:30.538
I suppose you will not.

558
00:34:33.642 --> 00:34:34.608
Three days. Sanger.

559
00:34:38.251 --> 00:34:42.616
Although. I guess you are
now the Mr. Rainsford?

560
00:34:44.323 --> 00:34:45.157
Ah.

561
00:34:48.789 --> 00:34:49.623
Ah.

562
00:34:50.593 --> 00:34:52.164
This is good.

563
00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:53.627
Fire in your eyes.

564
00:34:55.202 --> 00:34:55.827
Ah.

565
00:34:57.468 --> 00:35:00.799
I'm excited to see what kind
of adversary you will be.

566
00:35:04.706 --> 00:35:05.540
Here.

567
00:35:07.742 --> 00:35:08.576
Put these on.

568
00:35:32.338 --> 00:35:35.240
Here we all are now. Sanger.

569
00:35:35.275 --> 00:35:37.869
I would like to introduce you
to Miss Mary. Mr. Quinlan.

570
00:35:39.411 --> 00:35:41.378
They have been here
for a few weeks now.

571
00:35:41.413 --> 00:35:44.546
I've been waiting for the most
opportune moment to use them.

572
00:35:45.648 --> 00:35:47.714
I think now. paired with you.

573
00:35:47.749 --> 00:35:50.684
will make the game
much more interesting.

574
00:35:53.623 --> 00:35:54.721
Do you have your supplies?

575
00:35:56.296 --> 00:35:58.329
Some fresh water. food.

576
00:35:58.364 --> 00:36:02.201
enough of such to last for
three days if rationed properly.

577
00:36:05.569 --> 00:36:07.206
I will give you three hours.

578
00:36:08.175 --> 00:36:10.671
Plenty enough time for
a good solid head start.

579
00:36:12.774 --> 00:36:15.742
You engaged in
the war years ago.

580
00:36:15.777 --> 00:36:17.513
That was not yours
to interrupt in.

581
00:36:18.846 --> 00:36:23.585
Today. we continue the
battle. Mr. Rainsford.

582
00:36:25.853 --> 00:36:26.720
Ah.

583
00:36:28.328 --> 00:36:28.953
Let us play.

584
00:36:31.958 --> 00:36:32.792
Run.

585
00:36:38.932 --> 00:36:41.735
I will see you
soon. Mr. Rainsford.

586
00:36:45.411 --> 00:36:46.773
Let the hunt begin.

587
00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:40.695
- Come on. come on.

588
00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:41.993
Let's go.

589
00:37:42.028 --> 00:37:44.336
No. no. Mary. Mary.
we can't stop.

590
00:37:44.371 --> 00:37:46.063
We have to keep moving.

591
00:37:46.098 --> 00:37:47.933
Come on.
- Where are we gonna go?

592
00:37:47.968 --> 00:37:48.967
We don't even have a plan.

593
00:37:51.378 --> 00:37:54.742
- The plan is just to
keep moving. all right?

594
00:37:54.777 --> 00:37:55.809
We have to go. come on.

595
00:37:56.779 --> 00:37:58.042
Whoa. whoa.

596
00:37:58.077 --> 00:38:02.013
Look.

597
00:38:02.048 --> 00:38:04.389
- I'm afraid we
didn't have a chance

598
00:38:04.424 --> 00:38:06.787
to properly introduce
ourselves back there.

599
00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:13.057
- Yeah. well. I don't
think it matters right now.

600
00:38:14.863 --> 00:38:15.829
- It matters.

601
00:38:16.665 --> 00:38:18.799
Look. if we're gonna
survive together.

602
00:38:18.834 --> 00:38:20.933
it's not gonna hurt to
know each other's names.

603
00:38:21.902 --> 00:38:24.871
And I'm sorry. I didn't
catch yours back there

604
00:38:24.906 --> 00:38:26.510
in the middle of that chaos.

605
00:38:26.545 --> 00:38:29.843
I was a bit distracted.

606
00:38:32.551 --> 00:38:33.682
- My name is Mary.

607
00:38:40.658 --> 00:38:41.492
- Quin.

608
00:38:42.528 --> 00:38:43.527
- My name is Sanger.

609
00:38:44.926 --> 00:38:47.091
- Sanger. how did you
come about the island?

610
00:38:48.567 --> 00:38:50.864
- I can only assume
the same as you two.

611
00:38:50.899 --> 00:38:54.131
traveling on a ship that
had no business sailing

612
00:38:54.166 --> 00:38:55.572
into these waters.

613
00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:02.612
What can you tell
me about the Baron?

614
00:39:02.647 --> 00:39:04.515
- He's a very evil man.

615
00:39:06.211 --> 00:39:07.012
- Calculated.

616
00:39:09.951 --> 00:39:11.654
- He leaves with people like us

617
00:39:11.689 --> 00:39:14.184
and he always comes back alone.

618
00:39:14.219 --> 00:39:16.461
- And usually with a
bloody canvas sack.

619
00:39:19.158 --> 00:39:22.434
- For his trophies and
his wall nonetheless.

620
00:39:23.833 --> 00:39:24.667
- His wall?

621
00:39:26.704 --> 00:39:27.934
- Yeah.

622
00:39:27.969 --> 00:39:29.936
Never mind. it's not important.

623
00:39:31.841 --> 00:39:33.874
- So how did you come
about these waters?

624
00:39:34.843 --> 00:39:37.812
- Me and my father. we
were on a hunting trip.

625
00:39:38.815 --> 00:39:41.948
We were going to a place
called Kodiak to hunt bear.

626
00:39:43.215 --> 00:39:44.049
And...

627
00:39:46.889 --> 00:39:49.989
Yes. I'm familiar
with hunting tactics

628
00:39:50.024 --> 00:39:51.628
and how to track prey.

629
00:39:52.697 --> 00:39:54.092
- So what do you suggest we do?

630
00:39:57.966 --> 00:40:02.903
- Well. I'd say we
follow this water.

631
00:40:03.972 --> 00:40:06.742
I can't tell you exactly the
type of hunter the Baron is.

632
00:40:08.273 --> 00:40:11.615
I mean. he talks as if he's
the most experienced hunter

633
00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:15.212
and I can only assume
he is quite the tracker.

634
00:40:15.247 --> 00:40:17.016
given his experience in the war.

635
00:40:18.624 --> 00:40:20.085
You know. if we stay
inside this water.

636
00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:22.494
it'll mask our
scent and our trail.

637
00:40:26.159 --> 00:40:28.995
- So do you think we'll survive?

638
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:31.965
- I think we have
a fighting chance.

639
00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:35.870
And that's something I
know a little bit about.

640
00:40:38.842 --> 00:40:40.578
How do you two know each other?

641
00:40:40.613 --> 00:40:41.876
- Quinlan is my brother.

642
00:40:42.846 --> 00:40:43.581
- I see.

643
00:40:44.881 --> 00:40:46.947
- We were heading north
to see our father.

644
00:40:48.951 --> 00:40:49.851
- He's very sick.

645
00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:53.954
And unfortunately he
doesn't have much time.

646
00:40:56.255 --> 00:41:00.059
- He's been working the fishing
docks down by the territory.

647
00:41:00.094 --> 00:41:02.534
We chartered a
vessel to get here.

648
00:41:02.569 --> 00:41:03.667
- And let me guess.

649
00:41:04.903 --> 00:41:06.967
Cutting through the channel
near the island would've saved

650
00:41:07.002 --> 00:41:09.101
a few extra days.

651
00:41:09.136 --> 00:41:11.037
- Yes. exactly.

652
00:41:11.072 --> 00:41:12.104
- All right then.

653
00:41:12.139 --> 00:41:15.140
What do you say we keep moving?

654
00:41:15.175 --> 00:41:17.010
Let's not let this
guy catch up to us.

655
00:41:17.045 --> 00:41:18.649
Yeah?

656
00:41:18.684 --> 00:41:19.518
- Okay.

657
00:41:52.311 --> 00:41:53.981
- This looks like a good spot.

658
00:41:55.886 --> 00:41:57.314
Let's rest up here
in this brush.

659
00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:03.221
- Well. we're sleeping
in those bushes?

660
00:42:03.256 --> 00:42:04.794
- Yeah.

661
00:42:04.829 --> 00:42:07.698
Look. we've been
walking a good while.

662
00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.228
Our scent shouldn't
be traceable.

663
00:42:10.263 --> 00:42:12.571
We've done a decent
job with our tracks.

664
00:42:14.168 --> 00:42:16.069
I say we rest up here
for a little while.

665
00:42:16.104 --> 00:42:19.743
Come nightfall. we'll
get back on the trail.

666
00:42:21.142 --> 00:42:22.944
- Where did you learn
about this sort of thing?

667
00:42:24.849 --> 00:42:26.079
- My father.

668
00:42:27.181 --> 00:42:28.081
- Where's he?

669
00:42:31.086 --> 00:42:32.052
- Baron shot him.

670
00:42:34.122 --> 00:42:35.726
- I'm sorry.

671
00:42:35.761 --> 00:42:36.661
- Yeah. me too.

672
00:42:37.323 --> 00:42:38.157
- He shot him?

673
00:42:39.226 --> 00:42:40.093
Where?

674
00:42:41.668 --> 00:42:46.671
- We were at dinner
before I met you two.

675
00:42:48.675 --> 00:42:51.302
and my father refused
to hunt with him.

676
00:42:53.273 --> 00:42:54.140
- That's not like him.

677
00:42:55.143 --> 00:42:56.879
- What do you mean?

678
00:42:59.048 --> 00:43:00.718
- He doesn't shoot anyone

679
00:43:00.753 --> 00:43:03.622
unless he takes him out
here into the forest.

680
00:43:05.758 --> 00:43:07.120
So why did he keep you alive?

681
00:43:10.191 --> 00:43:11.025
- I'm not sure.

682
00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:16.228
- Yeah. well. it probably
would've been better

683
00:43:16.263 --> 00:43:17.130
to die over there.

684
00:43:18.333 --> 00:43:21.398
- Being shot there doesn't give
you a chance to fight back.

685
00:43:23.072 --> 00:43:24.973
- And you know
something about that?

686
00:43:25.008 --> 00:43:25.842
- I do.

687
00:43:27.274 --> 00:43:30.913
- What. are you a
soldier or something?

688
00:43:30.948 --> 00:43:31.782
- I was.

689
00:43:33.049 --> 00:43:33.949
Look. enough of that.

690
00:43:33.984 --> 00:43:34.983
Let's get some rest.

691
00:43:36.283 --> 00:43:37.887
For both of you.

692
00:43:37.922 --> 00:43:39.284
If we're gonna survive
the next three days.

693
00:43:39.319 --> 00:43:41.154
we're gonna need all
the rest we can get.

694
00:43:42.157 --> 00:43:42.991
Let's go.

695
00:43:44.324 --> 00:43:46.192
Enough talking.

696
00:45:18.319 --> 00:45:19.318
Nobody move.

697
00:45:40.605 --> 00:45:43.078
Quinlan. control yourself.

698
00:45:46.281 --> 00:45:47.346
- He's gone.

699
00:45:47.381 --> 00:45:48.952
He's gone.

700
00:45:48.987 --> 00:45:50.085
We have to go. we
have to go right now.

701
00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:50.954
- No.

702
00:45:53.288 --> 00:45:54.287
- Do not move.

703
00:45:55.994 --> 00:45:57.059
- We must run.

704
00:45:57.094 --> 00:45:58.258
Let's go.

705
00:45:58.293 --> 00:45:59.391
- Stop.

706
00:45:59.426 --> 00:46:00.931
Quinlan. stop.

707
00:46:00.966 --> 00:46:02.097
- We must run.

708
00:46:04.035 --> 00:46:04.869
- Damn it.

709
00:46:06.004 --> 00:46:07.432
- Come on. we gotta go. guys.

710
00:46:07.467 --> 00:46:08.972
Come on. come on.

711
00:46:55.416 --> 00:46:56.415
- Run. run!

712
00:47:19.539 --> 00:47:21.209
- Let's go.

713
00:47:25.578 --> 00:47:30.383
- The game is much more fun
when you run. Mr. Rainsford!

714
00:47:40.725 --> 00:47:42.461
Go.

715
00:47:42.496 --> 00:47:43.902
Tend your wounds.

716
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:46.168
They will leave a trail

717
00:47:46.203 --> 00:47:47.466
that Rainsford might
be able to follow.

718
00:47:47.501 --> 00:47:49.468
And we certainly
do not need that.

719
00:47:49.503 --> 00:47:50.337
Go.

720
00:47:55.245 --> 00:47:56.640
Bullet went into your lung. boy.

721
00:47:59.986 --> 00:48:01.645
That's why you are
short of breath.

722
00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:03.152
Beginning to suffocate.

723
00:48:05.057 --> 00:48:07.387
Soon. you will drown
in your own blood.

724
00:48:07.422 --> 00:48:08.960
Horrible way to die. I say.

725
00:48:10.392 --> 00:48:13.426
You proved nothing of a
worthy adversary. I'm afraid.

726
00:48:14.462 --> 00:48:15.428
I'm bored.

727
00:48:18.730 --> 00:48:20.433
- Please.

728
00:48:21.535 --> 00:48:23.040
- You aren't worth the bullet.

729
00:48:46.329 --> 00:48:51.035
But the faint hope of
mercy is worth the report.

730
00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:51.695
- Got it.

731
00:48:56.537 --> 00:48:58.273
- He didn't suffer.

732
00:48:58.308 --> 00:48:59.142
- What?

733
00:49:00.409 --> 00:49:02.145
- That was a kill shot.

734
00:49:03.313 --> 00:49:05.082
A shot meant to show
mercy on an animal

735
00:49:05.117 --> 00:49:07.612
if the previous shot from a
distance wasn't entirely fatal.

736
00:49:09.418 --> 00:49:10.681
- Mercy?

737
00:49:10.716 --> 00:49:13.222
That man has no mercy.

738
00:49:13.257 --> 00:49:15.026
- We don't have time for
this right now. okay?

739
00:49:15.061 --> 00:49:16.522
The only thing your brother
would want is for you to survive

740
00:49:16.557 --> 00:49:19.030
and in order to do that.
we have to keep moving.

741
00:49:19.065 --> 00:49:20.691
We can grieve him later.

742
00:49:20.726 --> 00:49:23.661
Right now. we need to create
distance between him and us.

743
00:49:24.763 --> 00:49:26.334
- Distance?

744
00:49:26.369 --> 00:49:27.203
Why?

745
00:49:29.075 --> 00:49:30.668
- Because I need
time to set a trap.

746
00:49:51.196 --> 00:49:52.525
This looks like a good spot.

747
00:49:59.534 --> 00:50:00.368
Yeah.

748
00:50:07.410 --> 00:50:08.805
Right here is good.

749
00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:09.674
Let's rest up.

750
00:50:35.669 --> 00:50:36.569
Hey.

751
00:50:38.573 --> 00:50:39.605
Can I ask you a question?

752
00:50:42.874 --> 00:50:47.811
After seeing your father.
would you have gone back

753
00:50:49.254 --> 00:50:52.585
to wherever it is
that you came from?

754
00:50:55.359 --> 00:50:56.160
- No.

755
00:50:56.888 --> 00:50:57.821
- Why not?

756
00:51:03.565 --> 00:51:05.598
- I'm from a small
town in Colorado

757
00:51:06.534 --> 00:51:09.701
and it's lovely there.
but there's no future.

758
00:51:12.409 --> 00:51:13.672
So my brother and I.

759
00:51:16.413 --> 00:51:19.645
we were gonna go
to the east coast

760
00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:21.680
to start a business together.

761
00:51:21.715 --> 00:51:22.747
- Entrepreneur.

762
00:51:24.454 --> 00:51:25.288
Okay.

763
00:51:27.754 --> 00:51:28.654
What kind of business?

764
00:51:32.792 --> 00:51:33.626
- I make chocolate.

765
00:51:35.399 --> 00:51:37.531
Seems ridiculous now. but...

766
00:51:37.566 --> 00:51:38.796
- Who doesn't like chocolate?

767
00:51:40.338 --> 00:51:43.174
I'd kill somebody right
now for some chocolate.

768
00:51:47.213 --> 00:51:48.509
- What about you?

769
00:51:48.544 --> 00:51:49.840
Have you ever been
to the east coast?

770
00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:53.646
- Yeah. yeah.

771
00:51:53.681 --> 00:51:54.647
I live there.

772
00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:56.451
New York.

773
00:51:58.554 --> 00:51:59.355
- Wow.

774
00:52:01.392 --> 00:52:04.195
I've never seen a big
city like New York before.

775
00:52:06.496 --> 00:52:07.660
What's that like?

776
00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:14.304
- Lots of people

777
00:52:15.802 --> 00:52:16.801
who love chocolate.

778
00:52:20.444 --> 00:52:22.939
And tall buildings
take all the sky.

779
00:52:24.646 --> 00:52:29.649
automobiles rumble and grumble
night and day. and rats.

780
00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:36.194
Lots of fucking rats.

781
00:52:41.432 --> 00:52:43.696
- I would really like
to see New York someday.

782
00:52:44.798 --> 00:52:46.369
- I'll tell you what.

783
00:52:46.404 --> 00:52:47.733
We get out of this.
I promise you will.

784
00:52:47.768 --> 00:52:49.339
I'll take you there myself.

785
00:52:50.705 --> 00:52:52.342
- That's kind of you.

786
00:52:52.377 --> 00:52:53.739
but we're in no place
to make any promises.

787
00:52:56.282 --> 00:52:56.940
- I'm a Rainsford.

788
00:52:58.779 --> 00:53:00.977
I know where I'm going. ma'am.

789
00:53:02.981 --> 00:53:04.585
- Honor.

790
00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:05.454
That's admirable.

791
00:53:07.953 --> 00:53:08.787
- Now.

792
00:53:12.925 --> 00:53:15.728
If I can find a
particular tree...

793
00:54:31.069 --> 00:54:32.739
- Did I do okay?

794
00:54:32.774 --> 00:54:35.346
- You did perfect.
- You think we got him?

795
00:54:43.686 --> 00:54:44.685
- Rainsford!

796
00:54:49.054 --> 00:54:49.888
Rainsford!

797
00:54:51.793 --> 00:54:52.627
Rainsford!

798
00:54:53.861 --> 00:54:54.794
Did I hit you?

799
00:54:55.995 --> 00:55:00.965
Oh. if so. it must
barely be an abrasion!

800
00:55:03.937 --> 00:55:06.839
If you can still hear
the sound of my voice.

801
00:55:08.513 --> 00:55:12.383
which I suppose you can. I
want to congratulate you!

802
00:55:13.815 --> 00:55:16.684
Not many men know how to
make a Malay mancatcher.

803
00:55:25.662 --> 00:55:28.960
A trap learned from
your father. I gather.

804
00:55:32.504 --> 00:55:36.836
Lucky for me. I
hunted in Morocco too.

805
00:55:42.041 --> 00:55:42.875
Rainsford.

806
00:55:43.713 --> 00:55:44.547
Rainsford!

807
00:55:46.518 --> 00:55:51.521
You have proved a very worthy
and very fun adversary.

808
00:55:52.491 --> 00:55:53.820
Mr. Rainsford.

809
00:56:03.029 --> 00:56:05.898
I'm going to go get
my wound dressed.

810
00:56:05.933 --> 00:56:07.768
It's only a slight one.

811
00:56:08.969 --> 00:56:11.706
but it may keep me
from aiming straight.

812
00:56:15.646 --> 00:56:16.909
But I will be back. sir.

813
00:56:25.557 --> 00:56:26.820
I will be back.

814
00:56:31.156 --> 00:56:31.990
Rainsford!

815
00:56:34.632 --> 00:56:36.599
Rainsford!

816
00:56:43.707 --> 00:56:45.069
I'll be coming back.

817
00:56:51.583 --> 00:56:52.208
Rainsford!

818
00:56:53.552 --> 00:56:55.948
Rainsford. I'm coming for you!

819
00:57:17.235 --> 00:57:18.740
- We have to bandage that.

820
00:57:21.206 --> 00:57:22.040
- Yeah. we do.

821
00:57:30.853 --> 00:57:31.984
- He left behind a trail?

822
00:57:33.251 --> 00:57:34.085
- Yeah.

823
00:57:38.058 --> 00:57:41.026
- Oh. I'm sorry I can't do more.

824
00:57:41.061 --> 00:57:41.895
- Hey.

825
00:57:43.162 --> 00:57:44.766
You have no reason to apologize.

826
00:57:46.066 --> 00:57:47.934
This isn't your fault.

827
00:57:47.969 --> 00:57:50.673
Why would you ever think you'd
be in a situation like this?

828
00:57:53.172 --> 00:57:55.040
- I've been thinking
about the large man.

829
00:57:56.780 --> 00:57:59.550
- The one he calls Ivan.
- Yes. Ivan.

830
00:57:59.585 --> 00:58:02.245
Back home. men used dogs
to chase the game birds

831
00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:04.115
and the mountain
cats from the woods.

832
00:58:05.756 --> 00:58:09.560
Do you suppose the Baron
uses the mute like a dog?

833
00:58:14.127 --> 00:58:15.027
- Yes.

834
00:58:16.162 --> 00:58:17.865
That's an accurate observation.

835
00:58:19.297 --> 00:58:21.704
Don't know how I
didn't see that.

836
00:58:21.739 --> 00:58:23.101
But you did.

837
00:58:23.136 --> 00:58:24.102
Well done. Mary.

838
00:58:26.205 --> 00:58:27.743
Hold on.

839
00:58:27.778 --> 00:58:29.173
- The Baron says he has a boat.

840
00:58:29.208 --> 00:58:30.680
I suggest we go find it.

841
00:58:32.046 --> 00:58:33.650
- The Baron's a liar.

842
00:58:33.685 --> 00:58:35.718
We don't know how many
men he actually has.

843
00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:37.786
where the ship would be.

844
00:58:39.988 --> 00:58:41.592
or if it even exists.

845
00:58:43.189 --> 00:58:47.224
- I overheard him talking
about bringing back supplies.

846
00:58:47.259 --> 00:58:48.632
- As did I.

847
00:58:48.667 --> 00:58:49.963
- So then it must be true.

848
00:58:53.969 --> 00:58:54.803
- Yeah.

849
00:58:56.972 --> 00:58:57.806
I suppose so.

850
00:58:59.403 --> 00:59:00.237
- Hey!

851
00:59:02.175 --> 00:59:03.273
Go back the other way.

852
00:59:04.243 --> 00:59:05.781
- The other way?
- Go!

853
00:59:08.016 --> 00:59:09.246
- We're not going back there.

854
00:59:10.381 --> 00:59:11.589
We're dead if we do.

855
00:59:15.188 --> 00:59:16.022
Who are you?

856
00:59:18.290 --> 00:59:21.126
- I am someone who tricked him.

857
00:59:21.161 --> 00:59:22.930
That's who I am.

858
00:59:22.965 --> 00:59:26.802
And nobody. but nobody will
compromise my hiding spot here.

859
00:59:26.837 --> 00:59:27.671
You understand?

860
00:59:28.839 --> 00:59:30.102
- Your ship sank here too.

861
00:59:31.677 --> 00:59:32.302
- Sank?

862
00:59:33.712 --> 00:59:35.140
Sank?

863
00:59:35.175 --> 00:59:37.241
Sank. what are you
talking about. sank?

864
00:59:37.276 --> 00:59:39.144
It was booby trapped.

865
00:59:39.179 --> 00:59:41.718
My men were hunted down
like pigs to the slaughter.

866
00:59:43.854 --> 00:59:46.250
But I. I survived.

867
00:59:46.285 --> 00:59:47.119
I fooled him.

868
00:59:49.354 --> 00:59:51.288
Now you two. go on. go.

869
00:59:53.996 --> 00:59:55.831
- Wait. please.

870
00:59:55.866 --> 00:59:56.997
We need your help.

871
01:00:01.267 --> 01:00:02.167
- I can't help you.

872
01:00:05.139 --> 01:00:05.973
- Yes. you can.

873
01:00:07.174 --> 01:00:08.943
You don't have any supplies.

874
01:00:08.978 --> 01:00:12.144
anything to clean and dress
this wound before it's infected?

875
01:00:12.179 --> 01:00:14.784
Anything. please.

876
01:00:19.285 --> 01:00:20.086
- Bugs.

877
01:00:20.988 --> 01:00:23.155
Bugs and dirt are
gonna get on that soon.

878
01:00:24.356 --> 01:00:25.795
Oh. this God forsaken place.

879
01:00:25.830 --> 01:00:27.159
Jesus Christ!

880
01:00:28.262 --> 01:00:31.097
If the Baron don't get you.
then the infection does.

881
01:00:36.808 --> 01:00:37.774
I had a...

882
01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:39.941
A daughter.

883
01:00:43.243 --> 01:00:45.210
I had a daughter. she...

884
01:00:45.245 --> 01:00:46.717
I have a daughter.

885
01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:50.083
She'd be about your age now.

886
01:00:55.761 --> 01:00:56.353
Come on.

887
01:01:52.851 --> 01:01:54.279
Yeah. it's pretty safe up here

888
01:01:54.314 --> 01:01:56.314
because the Baron
doesn't come around much.

889
01:01:57.856 --> 01:01:59.350
Those that he's hunting.

890
01:01:59.385 --> 01:02:00.956
he usually catches on
the first or second days.

891
01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:03.420
Most of those idiots. anyway.

892
01:02:03.455 --> 01:02:06.027
go rushing to the beaches
like a bunch of tourists.

893
01:02:07.063 --> 01:02:09.800
But unlike me.

894
01:02:09.835 --> 01:02:12.429
they didn't venture into
the interior of the island.

895
01:02:12.464 --> 01:02:14.167
But as you can see from here.

896
01:02:15.874 --> 01:02:18.501
I can see anyone coming
from a long distance.

897
01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:22.505
Now.

898
01:02:24.377 --> 01:02:25.783
Come on.

899
01:02:43.627 --> 01:02:44.461
See?

900
01:02:45.431 --> 01:02:46.837
I can see everything.

901
01:02:49.303 --> 01:02:51.237
Over there is where
they wash ashore

902
01:02:51.272 --> 01:02:55.879
after the Baron's seed mines
blow them to smithereens.

903
01:02:57.509 --> 01:02:59.916
And the Baron's hunting
lodge is over there.

904
01:03:01.513 --> 01:03:04.019
And up there over on the
other side is the valley

905
01:03:04.054 --> 01:03:05.317
where they all try to escape.

906
01:03:09.059 --> 01:03:10.322
- What was this place?

907
01:03:12.392 --> 01:03:14.161
- Well. as far as I can reckon.

908
01:03:14.196 --> 01:03:17.560
I think someone
lived here years ago

909
01:03:17.595 --> 01:03:19.331
with cattle of some sort.

910
01:03:19.366 --> 01:03:23.973
but it's a pretty sturdy
little structure actually.

911
01:03:24.976 --> 01:03:26.602
- Where did all this come from?

912
01:03:26.637 --> 01:03:31.145
- Oh. it washed ashore from
the boats that got blown up

913
01:03:32.348 --> 01:03:37.085
and. you know. then the tides
would just kind of move it

914
01:03:38.054 --> 01:03:41.925
around the island and
then I'd scavenge for it

915
01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:44.961
when he wasn't
out there hunting.

916
01:03:47.328 --> 01:03:49.933
- Earlier. you said
that you tricked him.

917
01:03:52.333 --> 01:03:53.497
- Yeah. I did.

918
01:03:55.336 --> 01:03:59.404
He hunted for me for three days.

919
01:04:00.979 --> 01:04:04.013
which under his rules
would've made me the victor.

920
01:04:04.048 --> 01:04:08.215
but the Wolf is not
an honorable man.

921
01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:12.054
And he doesn't like being
bested at his own game.

922
01:04:12.089 --> 01:04:14.452
- So he had zero intention
to let you on that ship.

923
01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:17.224
Assuming there is one.

924
01:04:18.128 --> 01:04:19.963
- Oh. there is a ship.

925
01:04:19.998 --> 01:04:24.363
It's anchored in the bay right
next to his hunting lodge.

926
01:04:24.970 --> 01:04:26.563
But no. no.

927
01:04:26.598 --> 01:04:28.532
there was no way he was gonna
let me get on that ship.

928
01:04:30.569 --> 01:04:32.569
At the end of the third day.

929
01:04:32.604 --> 01:04:37.013
he had me cornered
on top of this bluff.

930
01:04:37.048 --> 01:04:38.410
overlooking the ocean.

931
01:04:39.512 --> 01:04:40.412
And I...

932
01:04:43.615 --> 01:04:44.614
I jumped.

933
01:04:47.091 --> 01:04:49.388
Guess he thought I
committed suicide.

934
01:04:50.622 --> 01:04:53.194
He must have really
been disappointed.

935
01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:58.100
- Why have you not
gone to get the ship?

936
01:05:01.204 --> 01:05:06.141
- Well. I didn't really want
to give up my position here.

937
01:05:07.573 --> 01:05:09.573
And besides. I mean. it
takes more than one person

938
01:05:09.608 --> 01:05:12.114
to run a ship that size. right?

939
01:05:12.149 --> 01:05:14.578
And then. oh. then
there's the mute.

940
01:05:16.219 --> 01:05:17.185
- Ivan.

941
01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:18.615
- Yeah. the big Ruskie.

942
01:05:18.650 --> 01:05:20.584
He's insane.

943
01:05:20.619 --> 01:05:22.289
Insane. I'm telling you.

944
01:05:25.558 --> 01:05:27.459
And he's strong as
a bull. I might add.

945
01:05:28.395 --> 01:05:30.495
- You have
grenades and bullets.

946
01:05:30.530 --> 01:05:33.696
- Yeah. nothing to shoot
the bullets with though.

947
01:05:33.731 --> 01:05:36.039
The grenades. I don't know.

948
01:05:36.074 --> 01:05:39.636
I just haven't really
figured an opportune time to.

949
01:05:39.671 --> 01:05:40.978
or way to use them.

950
01:05:42.443 --> 01:05:43.475
- Trip wire.

951
01:05:45.050 --> 01:05:45.675
- Pardon me?

952
01:05:47.811 --> 01:05:50.020
- You can make trip
wires from grenades.

953
01:05:52.090 --> 01:05:53.518
Simple trap.

954
01:05:53.553 --> 01:05:55.355
- Yeah.

955
01:05:55.390 --> 01:05:56.488
That ain't a bad idea.

956
01:05:58.228 --> 01:06:00.492
What are you. some kind
of soldier or something?

957
01:06:01.429 --> 01:06:02.263
- I was.

958
01:06:04.399 --> 01:06:05.233
- Oh.

959
01:06:06.731 --> 01:06:09.732
Well. let's take a look at this.

960
01:06:09.767 --> 01:06:11.701
See what we can do.

961
01:06:11.736 --> 01:06:13.175
- What's your name. sir?

962
01:06:14.442 --> 01:06:19.445
- Oh. Benjamin Colt.
but you can call me Ben.

963
01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:21.513
Yeah.

964
01:06:23.121 --> 01:06:25.055
- And what do you do
for a living. Ben?

965
01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:27.387
- Well. would you believe it?

966
01:06:28.654 --> 01:06:30.654
I'm a doctor.

967
01:06:30.689 --> 01:06:32.524
Dr. Ben Colt.

968
01:06:33.758 --> 01:06:36.660
Hello.

969
01:06:48.179 --> 01:06:50.773
So where were you
actually headed to?

970
01:06:52.612 --> 01:06:54.282
- Really doesn't
matter much now.

971
01:06:56.715 --> 01:06:58.550
- No. I
suppose it doesn't.

972
01:07:00.158 --> 01:07:01.817
- How are we gonna
get off this island?

973
01:07:03.425 --> 01:07:08.098
- Well. I've never seen
two other survivors before.

974
01:07:10.267 --> 01:07:12.102
and least of all a soldier.

975
01:07:12.137 --> 01:07:16.436
but now that there's
three of us together.

976
01:07:17.637 --> 01:07:19.703
I think there's a
pretty good chance

977
01:07:19.738 --> 01:07:23.608
that we can take that boat.

978
01:07:23.643 --> 01:07:25.214
What do you think. soldier boy?

979
01:07:28.846 --> 01:07:30.582
- I say. at first
light. we move.

980
01:07:32.718 --> 01:07:34.817
Take this rag. mix
it with some water.

981
01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:38.689
make a trail to
divert the Baron.

982
01:07:38.724 --> 01:07:42.495
and then double back and
meet and bolt on the ship.

983
01:07:43.795 --> 01:07:47.368
- Remember. he's a sly
and cunning bastard.

984
01:07:48.668 --> 01:07:49.502
- I can do it.

985
01:07:51.638 --> 01:07:52.670
- Okay then.

986
01:07:52.705 --> 01:07:53.737
We have a plan.

987
01:07:59.679 --> 01:08:02.845
- But I am gonna need those
grenades. if you don't mind.

988
01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:04.583
- What for?

989
01:08:05.619 --> 01:08:06.882
- I just wanna leave our
host a little parting gift

990
01:08:06.917 --> 01:08:07.883
before we leave.

991
01:08:09.656 --> 01:08:10.622
For the both of us.

992
01:08:14.727 --> 01:08:18.663
- You know. I would reckon
to venture that you...

993
01:08:18.698 --> 01:08:23.635
You two have both lost
loved ones close to you. hm?

994
01:08:26.673 --> 01:08:30.312
Kind of a union
of rage and grief.

995
01:08:31.181 --> 01:08:33.777
Rather poetic metaphor.
don't you think?

996
01:08:33.812 --> 01:08:36.417
- There's nothing
poetic about it.

997
01:08:36.452 --> 01:08:39.750
He took our loved ones
and killed them for sport.

998
01:08:39.785 --> 01:08:41.257
He's a monster.

999
01:08:43.294 --> 01:08:44.656
- Yeah.

1000
01:08:44.691 --> 01:08:48.561
Well. love. men are
like that sometimes.

1001
01:08:48.596 --> 01:08:53.599
And occasionally we have to
just bear our fangs and claws

1002
01:08:55.273 --> 01:08:56.635
or otherwise we're no better

1003
01:08:56.670 --> 01:08:58.373
than the bugs beneath
our feet. are we?

1004
01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:02.674
- Only the strong
were made to survive.

1005
01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:04.709
- Got that right. soldier boy.

1006
01:09:04.744 --> 01:09:05.974
You're all good.
you're good now.

1007
01:09:06.009 --> 01:09:07.778
Hold on.

1008
01:09:07.813 --> 01:09:08.911
Let me put this on here.

1009
01:09:10.585 --> 01:09:11.749
- Thanks. doc.

1010
01:09:11.784 --> 01:09:12.684
- Mm-hm.

1011
01:09:17.592 --> 01:09:18.426
Okay.

1012
01:09:19.858 --> 01:09:20.692
There you go.

1013
01:09:45.785 --> 01:09:46.619
Good night.

1014
01:10:02.736 --> 01:10:03.966
- Do you think we'll make it?

1015
01:10:08.445 --> 01:10:09.609
- I made you a promise.

1016
01:10:12.878 --> 01:10:14.581
- Yes. and as I said.

1017
01:10:14.616 --> 01:10:16.880
we are not in a situation
to make any promises.

1018
01:10:21.854 --> 01:10:24.393
- Look. I'm gonna
get you on that ship

1019
01:10:25.462 --> 01:10:26.923
and you're gonna
see your father.

1020
01:10:29.928 --> 01:10:31.466
- If he's even still alive.

1021
01:10:38.376 --> 01:10:42.642
- Wish I was afforded the
doubt you take for granted.

1022
01:10:47.913 --> 01:10:52.784
The chance to talk
to him one more time.

1023
01:10:59.397 --> 01:11:00.363
- I'm sorry.

1024
01:11:02.631 --> 01:11:04.532
- You know the worst
part about death?

1025
01:11:07.966 --> 01:11:09.306
It's when it's unexpected.

1026
01:11:14.577 --> 01:11:15.411
You...

1027
01:11:18.647 --> 01:11:20.042
You don't get a proper goodbye.

1028
01:11:23.883 --> 01:11:25.817
- The stars never leave the sky.

1029
01:11:27.018 --> 01:11:29.557
Even in daylight. when
we can't see them.

1030
01:11:29.592 --> 01:11:30.591
they're still there.

1031
01:11:35.697 --> 01:11:37.763
- It's why we're gonna live.

1032
01:11:37.798 --> 01:11:38.830
It's why we must live.

1033
01:11:41.098 --> 01:11:42.669
It's why he's alive.

1034
01:11:43.969 --> 01:11:44.968
Okay?

1035
01:11:45.003 --> 01:11:45.804
- Okay.

1036
01:11:49.909 --> 01:11:52.074
- Just say your prayers
and go to sleep.

1037
01:12:00.788 --> 01:12:02.887
- Should probably get some rest.

1038
01:12:02.922 --> 01:12:03.756
- Yeah.

1039
01:12:05.155 --> 01:12:05.989
Yeah.

1040
01:12:13.130 --> 01:12:16.835
Say it.

1041
01:12:16.870 --> 01:12:18.441
- Say what?

1042
01:12:18.476 --> 01:12:20.905
- Say he's alive.

1043
01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:23.039
- He's alive. okay?

1044
01:12:23.074 --> 01:12:23.974
- Say it like you mean it.

1045
01:12:24.009 --> 01:12:25.008
- All right.

1046
01:12:25.912 --> 01:12:27.978
- I don't believe you.

1047
01:12:28.013 --> 01:12:29.111
- He's alive.

1048
01:12:29.146 --> 01:12:30.519
- I can't hear you.

1049
01:12:30.554 --> 01:12:31.652
- He's alive.

1050
01:12:36.219 --> 01:12:38.153
- You're goddamn right.

1051
01:13:35.685 --> 01:13:36.486
What is it?

1052
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:40.182
- The man's like
a damn bloodhound!

1053
01:13:42.593 --> 01:13:44.054
- I thought you said he
never came in this far.

1054
01:13:45.024 --> 01:13:46.892
- No.

1055
01:13:46.927 --> 01:13:49.994
What I said is he never had
any reason to come over here.

1056
01:13:51.163 --> 01:13:53.833
but now he's tracking new
prey. we've left a blood trail.

1057
01:13:53.868 --> 01:13:55.637
it's like a map right to us.

1058
01:13:55.672 --> 01:13:58.541
I shouldn't have been so stupid
as to go along with that.

1059
01:13:59.577 --> 01:14:00.169
- It's my fault.

1060
01:14:01.678 --> 01:14:02.743
I was careless.

1061
01:14:04.142 --> 01:14:05.713
Fuck.

1062
01:14:05.748 --> 01:14:07.682
I should have taken
better precautions.

1063
01:14:09.752 --> 01:14:10.982
I know better than that.

1064
01:14:19.157 --> 01:14:19.991
- Ivan.

1065
01:14:21.797 --> 01:14:23.126
There are three sets of tracks.

1066
01:14:25.966 --> 01:14:29.099
Somehow they found
a third person.

1067
01:14:31.004 --> 01:14:32.036
Who could that be?

1068
01:14:39.111 --> 01:14:43.014
I can only think of one
whose body I never found.

1069
01:14:48.351 --> 01:14:49.218
Flush them out.

1070
01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:56.797
I already cut out your tongue.

1071
01:14:58.328 --> 01:15:01.032
Yet your hesitation
speaks volumes.

1072
01:15:02.101 --> 01:15:04.233
As does your
concentration on me.

1073
01:15:06.875 --> 01:15:08.644
Shall I tear out
your eyes as well?

1074
01:15:12.210 --> 01:15:13.044
Go.

1075
01:15:15.818 --> 01:15:16.652
Go!

1076
01:15:27.192 --> 01:15:28.763
- Oh. now where did he go?

1077
01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:30.897
- I don't know.

1078
01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:34.065
But I don't like being
trapped in like this.

1079
01:15:38.170 --> 01:15:39.972
- What's happening?

1080
01:15:41.371 --> 01:15:42.304
- The Baron's here.

1081
01:15:43.241 --> 01:15:44.141
He's watching us.

1082
01:15:48.081 --> 01:15:49.619
- Oh God.

1083
01:15:49.654 --> 01:15:50.719
What are we gonna do?

1084
01:15:51.855 --> 01:15:54.151
- Well. the only other
option is to go out the back.

1085
01:15:54.186 --> 01:15:55.790
that's a 20 foot drop.

1086
01:15:57.288 --> 01:15:59.860
And then you're in the
range of his rifle fire.

1087
01:16:04.427 --> 01:16:07.098
I guess we wait for the
Wolf to come for us.

1088
01:16:08.134 --> 01:16:08.935
I don't know.

1089
01:17:55.142 --> 01:17:55.976
Hey!

1090
01:18:06.351 --> 01:18:07.515
- We have to go!

1091
01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:08.890
- We can't leave him.

1092
01:18:08.925 --> 01:18:10.287
- Get outta here!

1093
01:18:10.322 --> 01:18:11.827
- Come on.
it's our only chance.

1094
01:18:31.948 --> 01:18:34.113
- Ah. the hunt is back on.

1095
01:19:01.978 --> 01:19:06.574
- I suppose everyone
must lose a loyal dog

1096
01:19:06.609 --> 01:19:08.246
at some point in their lives.

1097
01:19:15.024 --> 01:19:15.858
Rainsford!

1098
01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:17.992
I'm coming for you!

1099
01:19:18.027 --> 01:19:19.059
- Where are we going?

1100
01:19:21.393 --> 01:19:22.865
- Well. if we're gonna assume

1101
01:19:24.264 --> 01:19:26.396
that the doctor just left
Ivan that parting gift

1102
01:19:31.007 --> 01:19:35.944
and the Baron is without
his beloved bloodhound.

1103
01:19:37.574 --> 01:19:39.310
I say we make a
run for that ship.

1104
01:19:40.412 --> 01:19:41.246
- Okay.

1105
01:19:41.281 --> 01:19:42.082
Okay. let's go.

1106
01:19:57.528 --> 01:19:58.428
It's okay.

1107
01:19:58.463 --> 01:19:59.363
- Oh. are you sure?

1108
01:19:59.398 --> 01:20:00.969
- Yes.

1109
01:20:01.004 --> 01:20:03.169
- Okay. okay. just
hold on. stop moving.

1110
01:20:03.204 --> 01:20:04.907
Gimme a second. I'm gonna
get you outta there.

1111
01:20:24.225 --> 01:20:25.587
- Sanger. you have to go.

1112
01:20:26.997 --> 01:20:28.458
- Mary. I'm not leaving you.

1113
01:20:28.493 --> 01:20:30.361
- You have to.

1114
01:20:30.396 --> 01:20:31.560
We can't let him win.

1115
01:20:33.399 --> 01:20:36.367
- I made a promise to you
and I intend on keeping it.

1116
01:20:36.402 --> 01:20:38.501
- The only way you're
gonna keep that promise is

1117
01:20:38.536 --> 01:20:40.470
if you survive.

1118
01:20:46.577 --> 01:20:48.379
He's aiming for you. not me.

1119
01:20:48.414 --> 01:20:50.348
You're the one he's hunting.

1120
01:20:52.319 --> 01:20:53.384
- I'm coming back for you.

1121
01:21:20.479 --> 01:21:21.412
- Get back!

1122
01:21:22.481 --> 01:21:24.646
- Such a futile attempt.

1123
01:21:24.681 --> 01:21:27.990
You've been captured. my
dear. and there is no escape.

1124
01:21:31.061 --> 01:21:31.686
I must say.

1125
01:21:33.690 --> 01:21:37.494
Mr. Rainsford and you have
been quite fun to chase.

1126
01:21:40.598 --> 01:21:41.465
- Is he dead?

1127
01:21:42.634 --> 01:21:44.567
- I've learned that if I
can't physically see the body

1128
01:21:44.602 --> 01:21:47.108
of my prey. I must
assume them alive.

1129
01:21:51.147 --> 01:21:53.378
That is where this
little hunt of ours

1130
01:21:54.282 --> 01:21:56.150
has become quite interesting.

1131
01:21:58.055 --> 01:21:58.988
- What do you mean?

1132
01:22:00.618 --> 01:22:01.991
- Well. I too am good at traps.

1133
01:22:02.026 --> 01:22:03.421
as you can see for yourself.

1134
01:22:05.227 --> 01:22:07.491
When I knew you were
holed up in that shack.

1135
01:22:07.526 --> 01:22:09.460
I set several around the area.

1136
01:22:09.495 --> 01:22:12.496
not knowing precisely
which way you would flee.

1137
01:22:15.171 --> 01:22:17.633
This has given
way to a new idea.

1138
01:22:19.802 --> 01:22:24.079
much like how the Indians
taught me how to hunt a tiger.

1139
01:22:26.281 --> 01:22:31.284
One must use live bait
sometimes to catch big game.

1140
01:22:33.585 --> 01:22:35.255
And bait you are. my dear.

1141
01:24:30.801 --> 01:24:34.275
In India. in Africa.

1142
01:24:35.674 --> 01:24:38.774
they use a stake to tie off
a little pig or lamb to.

1143
01:24:41.878 --> 01:24:44.714
Live bait for big game. you see.

1144
01:24:45.684 --> 01:24:46.782
Dangerous game.

1145
01:24:48.489 --> 01:24:49.884
The most dangerous game.

1146
01:24:52.625 --> 01:24:54.295
And like I said.

1147
01:24:54.330 --> 01:24:58.497
humans can reason. but
they also have empathy.

1148
01:25:00.798 --> 01:25:03.700
And the fear of
leaving one behind is

1149
01:25:03.735 --> 01:25:05.537
too great a burden for some.

1150
01:25:08.212 --> 01:25:10.245
I think it weakness.
quite frankly.

1151
01:25:11.809 --> 01:25:12.742
- You are heartless!

1152
01:25:14.944 --> 01:25:16.647
- Oh yes. I've
heard this before.

1153
01:25:17.815 --> 01:25:18.649
But no matter.

1154
01:25:19.852 --> 01:25:23.753
A lion need not listen to
the opinion of a little lamb.

1155
01:25:27.660 --> 01:25:29.297
We will wait.

1156
01:25:29.332 --> 01:25:31.662
And we will see if
Rainsford comes for you.

1157
01:25:32.830 --> 01:25:34.500
- I hope he doesn't
come back at all.

1158
01:25:35.866 --> 01:25:37.965
- Why would you
say such a thing?

1159
01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.703
- So that you know defeat.

1160
01:25:40.906 --> 01:25:44.411
So that you feel the loss of
the greatest hunt of your life.

1161
01:25:51.519 --> 01:25:54.289
- It is the greatest
hunt of my life.

1162
01:25:56.986 --> 01:25:58.491
but I will win. my dear.

1163
01:26:00.627 --> 01:26:02.726
and Rainsford's head
will find my wall.

1164
01:26:04.796 --> 01:26:06.895
- That is never gonna happen.

1165
01:26:06.930 --> 01:26:08.567
He will not come back.

1166
01:26:11.836 --> 01:26:12.670
- We will see.

1167
01:26:15.675 --> 01:26:16.509
We will see.

1168
01:26:18.711 --> 01:26:19.710
Oh. Rainsford!

1169
01:26:43.868 --> 01:26:45.736
- Hate to say I told you so.

1170
01:26:46.772 --> 01:26:47.738
- Be quiet.

1171
01:26:49.511 --> 01:26:52.611
- Sanger is much.
much smarter than you.

1172
01:26:52.646 --> 01:26:53.744
Stronger too.

1173
01:26:54.945 --> 01:26:55.944
- I said. be quiet.

1174
01:26:57.147 --> 01:27:00.685
- He's probably found your boat
by now and already set sail.

1175
01:27:03.822 --> 01:27:05.327
- It takes two to operate.

1176
01:27:08.860 --> 01:27:10.695
He's still here.

1177
01:27:10.730 --> 01:27:11.795
He's just being a coward!

1178
01:27:13.502 --> 01:27:14.765
- He is no coward.

1179
01:27:16.439 --> 01:27:18.032
How's Ivan doing. by the way?

1180
01:27:18.936 --> 01:27:20.771
Man's best friend.

1181
01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:27.778
- You know. when the lion
or tiger doesn't come

1182
01:27:27.813 --> 01:27:32.321
for the bait. they stick it.

1183
01:27:33.357 --> 01:27:34.488
So it bleeds.

1184
01:27:37.559 --> 01:27:39.460
Maybe we stick your
little piggy here!

1185
01:27:40.663 --> 01:27:44.762
Maybe her screams and her
squeals will make you come out

1186
01:27:44.797 --> 01:27:46.995
and face your fate!

1187
01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:57.379
Bullets coming down with no arc.

1188
01:27:59.977 --> 01:28:01.317
Where are you?

1189
01:28:10.625 --> 01:28:12.053
There you are. there you are.

1190
01:28:14.926 --> 01:28:17.993
That must
have been you!

1191
01:28:18.028 --> 01:28:19.335
I must have hit you!

1192
01:28:26.168 --> 01:28:28.003
I must have got him.
I must have got him.

1193
01:28:32.878 --> 01:28:35.516
How did he get a rifle anyhow?

1194
01:28:35.551 --> 01:28:37.045
Where. where?

1195
01:28:39.049 --> 01:28:39.850
Damn you!

1196
01:28:47.024 --> 01:28:48.661
He has to. he has to
be out of bullets.

1197
01:28:48.696 --> 01:28:50.058
He has to. right?

1198
01:28:57.771 --> 01:28:59.936
He has to reload.
he has to reload!

1199
01:29:19.991 --> 01:29:20.825
Rainsford.

1200
01:29:24.193 --> 01:29:25.896
You're more quiet
than the jaguar.

1201
01:29:27.064 --> 01:29:28.767
A true beast of prey.

1202
01:29:30.969 --> 01:29:32.408
- Baron Von Wolf.

1203
01:29:36.172 --> 01:29:39.778
- I must say. it looks
like you have won the game.

1204
01:29:42.244 --> 01:29:46.554
Shall we have some port and
discuss how I will get you home?

1205
01:29:48.591 --> 01:29:49.425
- Home?

1206
01:29:51.825 --> 01:29:54.661
A few days ago. I
watched my father die

1207
01:29:54.696 --> 01:29:57.895
in this chair by your hand.

1208
01:30:00.999 --> 01:30:04.000
Now I'm gonna watch
you die by mine.

1209
01:30:19.985 --> 01:30:20.951
- I see.

1210
01:30:24.990 --> 01:30:29.960
Well. one of us will
feed the birds tonight.

1211
01:30:32.767 --> 01:30:37.066
And the other shall sleep
in my very comfortable bed.

1212
01:30:45.109 --> 01:30:48.077
En garde. Mr. Rainsford.

1213
01:31:59.183 --> 01:31:59.984
- We made it.

1214
01:32:01.086 --> 01:32:02.052
Thank God.

1215
01:32:04.254 --> 01:32:05.957
- It's not over yet.

1216
01:32:05.992 --> 01:32:06.826
- What?

1217
01:32:10.799 --> 01:32:12.062
- I made a promise to you.

1218
01:32:14.165 --> 01:32:19.069
Look. again. after
seeing your father.

1219
01:32:22.305 --> 01:32:25.273
are you gonna go back
to wherever it is
you came from. or...

1220
01:32:30.148 --> 01:32:32.621
- I've never seen
New York before.
