12
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.310
- What are you doing here?

13
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.880
- Wanna go to the park with me?

14
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.060
- I don't know. it's really late out

15
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.850
and my dad's on patrol.

16
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.820
- That's even better. we won't get caught.

17
00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.690
- Anyway. it's too cold out.
I'd rather stay in the house.

18
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.540
- Don't be such a baby.

19
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.890
- I'm not being a baby.
I'm just obeying my father.

20
00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.780
- Fine. I'm going to the park.

21
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.103
You know where to find me.

22
00:05:54.369 --> 00:05:55.773

40
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:42.965
Nice car.

41
00:09:42.965 --> 00:09:45.935
I really appreciate the ride.

42
00:09:45.935 --> 00:09:48.602
Can you drop me off at the town?

43
00:09:50.688 --> 00:09:52.958
You don't talk much.

44
00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.068
Are you okay?

45
00:09:54.068 --> 00:09:56.549

(whimpers)

47
00:09:59.827 --> 00:10:01.606
- [Michelle] Mandy. Mandy. let me in!

48
00:10:01.606 --> 00:10:03.260
Hurry. let me in. Mandy!

49
00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.303
- What. what. what's wrong with you?

50
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.317
- There was a monster with a black cloak

51
00:10:08.317 --> 00:10:09.948
in the woods. in the woods!
- What are you talking about?

52
00:10:09.948 --> 00:10:11.155
Just calm down. come on.
- In a black cloak!

53
00:10:11.155 --> 00:10:13.463
- Come on. let's go to my
room. I'll call my dad.

54
00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.620
- I was going through the
woods to get to the park.

55
00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.540
and I kept hearing these weird noises.

56
00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:23.070
And then I felt like
something was watching me.

57
00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:26.560
So I made it to the park.
but the sound followed me.

58
00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.540
and I kept hearing the noises.

59
00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.690
And then something grabbed me.

60
00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.870
And then I couldn't move.

61
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.850
And then I kept hearing this
screeching. and I blacked out.

62
00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.390
And I woke up on the ground.

63
00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:40.390
and I just came here as fast as I could.

64
00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.640
- Someone tried to kidnap you?

65
00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.160
I gotta tell my dad.

66
00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.440
- No. don't tell your dad.

67
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.350
He'll tell my parents.

68
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:49.520
and then I'll get in
trouble for sneaking out.

69
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.280
- Don't worry. he won't tell your parents.

70
00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.650
but I do have to tell him.

71
00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:55.533
- Okay. you're right.

72
00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.583
You should know best.

73
00:11:01.087 --> 00:11:03.837
(radio chatters)

74
00:11:13.231 --> 00:11:16.200
- Who taught this guy to drive?

75
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.117
(foreboding music)

76
00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.870
Who runs a stop sign
in a residential area?

77
00:11:52.426 --> 00:11:55.259
(car door closes)

78
00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:02.610
How's it going tonight?

79
00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:04.510
I'm Sheriff Clark.

80
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:05.343
I stopped you because

81
00:12:05.343 --> 00:12:08.941
you rolled that stop sign.
(phone rings)

82
00:12:08.941 --> 00:12:13.670
Hold on a second.

83
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:15.841
- Dad. I need you to come home now.

84
00:12:15.841 --> 00:12:17.990
Someone just tried to kidnap Michelle.

85
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:19.210
I don't know who it was.

86
00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:22.010
She's in shock right now
and really terrified.

87
00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:24.150
- Okay. all right. I'll be right there.

88
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:25.510
All right buddy. this is your lucky night.

89
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:26.920
Go ahead and go.

90
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.093
Watch those stop signs.

91
00:12:30.617 --> 00:12:33.534
(foreboding music)

92
00:12:53.017 --> 00:12:53.850
Mandy!

93
00:12:55.179 --> 00:12:57.909
- [Mandy] In here. Dad!

94
00:12:57.909 --> 00:13:00.409
- Okay. tell me what happened.

95
00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.630
- I was walking through the woods.

96
00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:05.640
and I kept hearing these noises.

97
00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.007
And then I heard them
when I got to the park.

98
00:13:08.007 --> 00:13:11.570
And then I saw this figure.

99
00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:14.117
- I need to know what he looked like.

100
00:13:14.117 --> 00:13:16.167
- [Michelle] All I saw was a black cloak.

101
00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:19.660
- Did you see his face?

102
00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:20.593
- Not really.

103
00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.303
- Okay. the good thing is
that you're not hurt. okay?

104
00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.090
This just happened at the park?

105
00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:31.210
- Yes.

106
00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.770
- Okay. I'm gonna head out to the park

107
00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:34.270
and see what I can find. okay?

108
00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:36.370
You stay here with Mandy.

109
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:39.423
When I get back. I'm gonna
take you to your parents.

110
00:13:41.272 --> 00:13:42.323
Okay.
- All right.

111
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.030
- All right.

112
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:47.630
You two stay here. I'll be back.

113
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.210
Don't answer the door for anyone.

114
00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.497
Wait till I get back.

115
00:13:57.497 --> 00:14:00.414
(foreboding music)

116
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.440
- I didn't tell your dad. but I swear

117
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.760
that thing in the cloak was an alien.

118
00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:23.110
- You don't really
believe in aliens. do you?

119
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:26.143
- Of course not. but
that thing was inhuman.

120
00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.740
I'd never been so scared before.

121
00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:32.223
It tried to kill me.

122
00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:36.543
- Well. you're safe here. my dad's a hero.

123
00:14:36.543 --> 00:14:39.460
(foreboding music)

124
00:14:57.954 --> 00:14:58.787
Dad?

125
00:14:59.652 --> 00:15:02.152
(tense music)

126
00:15:29.491 --> 00:15:31.991
(tense music)

127
00:15:51.699 --> 00:15:54.699
(suspenseful music)

128
00:16:01.779 --> 00:16:03.946
(screams)

129
00:16:07.192 --> 00:16:09.461
The thing in the cloak that
you saw on the playground.

130
00:16:09.461 --> 00:16:11.090
the thing that attacked you.
it's in the house right now!

131
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:13.159
I don't know how it got in. but it's in!

132
00:16:13.159 --> 00:16:14.571
It's in here now!

133
00:16:14.571 --> 00:16:16.372
I saw it. you were right!

134
00:16:16.372 --> 00:16:19.033
(girls scream)

135
00:16:19.033 --> 00:16:20.616
- What is going on?

136
00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:26.070
Look. I know there's been
a lot going on tonight.

137
00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:28.610
I think we all just need some rest.

138
00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:29.870
- There was a monster in the house. Dad.

139
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:33.690
There was a monster in
the house. I saw it.

140
00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:35.870
- There's no such thing
as monsters. Mandy.

141
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.080
- I heard a noise. and then
I went to check it out.

142
00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.160
The door was wide open.

143
00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.123
- The door was locked.

144
00:16:41.123 --> 00:16:43.590
I unlocked the door when I came in.

145
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:46.650
- I kept hearing this weird whisper.

146
00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:49.600
almost like a whispering
noise. in my ear or something.

147
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.630
I can't really explain it.
but I went to the kitchen.

148
00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:54.923
and then it was just standing there.

149
00:16:55.839 --> 00:16:57.400
I didn't really get a good luck at it.

150
00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.780
I just saw that there was a black cloak.

151
00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:02.870
and I just got scared
and ran to the bedroom

152
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:04.920
as fast as I could.
- Look.

153
00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.130
I think we all just need some rest.

154
00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:09.630
- But Dad. I'm telling the truth.

155
00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:12.010
- Michelle. I'm gonna take you home.

156
00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:13.233
Mandy. you come with us.

157
00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:16.053
There's no such thing as monsters.

158
00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.170
Come on. girls.

159
00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:22.810
- Please. Mr. Clark. can I
just stay with y'all tonight?

160
00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:25.252
My mom's working overnight
at the general store.

161
00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:27.643
- That's fine.

162
00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.930
All right. you can stay here tonight.

163
00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.130
Just call your mother and let her know.

164
00:17:36.536 --> 00:17:39.840
And stop thinking about
monsters. there's no such thing.

165
00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.227
(ominous music)

166
00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:33.710
(phone rings)

167
00:18:43.064 --> 00:18:44.182
Sheriff.

168
00:18:44.182 --> 00:18:48.543
- [Mrs. Jones] Sheriff
Clark. this is Mrs. Jones.

169
00:18:48.543 --> 00:18:50.453
I wanted to call you.

170
00:18:50.453 --> 00:18:54.790
Stanley is missing.
- Okay. calm down. Mrs. Jones.

171
00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:56.803
- On High Street.
- Stanley's missing.

172
00:18:58.410 --> 00:18:59.410
How long has he been gone?

173
00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:02.210
- [Mrs. Jones] He's been
gone for four hours.

174
00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:03.043
- Four hours.

175
00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:06.247
Let's just give it some
time. Ms. Jones. okay?

176
00:19:06.247 --> 00:19:08.060
- Okay.
- Maybe he'll show back up

177
00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:08.900
in a little bit.

178
00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.956
- [Mrs. Jones] I have given
it time. I'm just worried

179
00:19:11.956 --> 00:19:12.789
about my husband.
- I have to wait 24 hours

180
00:19:12.789 --> 00:19:14.343
to do a missing persons report.

181
00:19:16.464 --> 00:19:19.490
- [Mrs. Jones] He was
going up to the store.

182
00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:22.403
and I don't know where he could have went

183
00:19:22.403 --> 00:19:25.400
and what could have happened to him.

184
00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.620
- If he doesn't come back. call me back.

185
00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:30.530
I'll go out. I'll find him.

186
00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:32.900
Right now I'm the only
law enforcement officer

187
00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:34.410
in the county.

188
00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:37.390
I have to get some rest. I've
been out all day. all night.

189
00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:40.606
- [Mrs. Jones] You should
be more sympathetic.

190
00:19:40.606 --> 00:19:43.850
- I am being sympathetic. I do care.

191
00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:45.740
But if I don't get any
rest. I won't be any good

192
00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:47.640
to anybody.
- I was just worried

193
00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.490
and hoping he wasn't in that fire.

194
00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:51.594
- [Clark] A fire?

195
00:19:51.594 --> 00:19:53.900
- [Mrs. Jones] Yes. there was a fire.

196
00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.080
- [Clark] I didn't even get
a call about a fire tonight.

197
00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.170
- [Mrs. Jones] Near the water.

198
00:19:57.170 --> 00:20:00.890
I could see it from my window.

199
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:02.990
- All right. check back in
with me in the morning. okay?

200
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:04.410
I'm sure he's gonna show up.

201
00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:06.653
- [Mrs. Jones] Okay. but if you find him.

202
00:20:06.653 --> 00:20:08.957
please bring him home.
- Okay. take care. Ms. Jones.

203
00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:15.353
A fire.

204
00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:19.363
What's going on in this town?

205
00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:22.933
I need a break.

206
00:20:34.674 --> 00:20:37.591
(foreboding music)

207
00:20:39.693 --> 00:20:43.693
- [Anchor] You are watching
WCB TV News at Nine.

Today's headline is gonna
be lights in the sky.

209
00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:52.323
Lights in the sky for two days.

210
00:20:53.906 --> 00:20:55.406
- [Alien] Help me.

211
00:20:56.983 --> 00:20:58.066
Help me.

212
00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:03.080

Maine have had several claims

213
00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:06.593

00:21:07.652 --> 00:21:09.152
- [Alien] Help me.

215
00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.370

217
00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:25.230

218
00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:30.373
and a explanation of
the lights in the sky.

219
00:21:30.373 --> 00:21:33.040
(ominous music)

220
00:21:55.259 --> 00:21:56.759
- [Alien] Help me.

221
00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:03.040
(tense music)

222
00:23:00.198 --> 00:23:03.115
(foreboding music)

223
00:23:32.038 --> 00:23:35.038
(suspenseful music)

224
00:24:53.521 --> 00:24:54.354
- Mandy!

225
00:24:57.101 --> 00:24:57.934
Mandy!

226
00:25:02.007 --> 00:25:03.007
Get in here.

227
00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:07.750
What are you doing out there. young lady?

228
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:10.890
- I heard a voice. and it was
saying "Help me. help me."

229
00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:12.700
so I went outside to check it out.

230
00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.380
and then I turned around the house.

231
00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.833
and I saw an alien. there
was an alien out there.

232
00:25:16.833 --> 00:25:20.240
- There's no such thing as aliens.

233
00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.483
- It was calling me.

234
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.750
It didn't sound threatening at all.

235
00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:36.253
More like it was sad. scared.
and didn't know what to do.

236
00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:40.140
- There's no such thing as aliens.

237
00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:42.850
- Yeah. I know it sounds
crazy. but it's true.

238
00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:43.945
There was an alien out there.

239
00:25:43.945 --> 00:25:45.800
- And why didn't you come get me then?

240
00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.560
Who told you you could
just go out of the house

241
00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:48.703
without asking me?

242
00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:51.490
With what happened to your friend.

243
00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:53.100
there's crazy people running around.

244
00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:55.307
Anything could've happened to you.

245
00:25:55.307 --> 00:25:57.860
- It didn't sound threatening.
it sounded scared.

246
00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:59.560
- Look. I know things have been hard

247
00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.660
since your mother passed away.

248
00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:03.830
But aliens. come on now.

249
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:07.200
- I'm not crazy. I promise.
it was really there.

250
00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.850
- [Clark] We're not
talking about it anymore.

251
00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:10.530
- But it talked to me.

252
00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:14.700
- Let's go get some rest. and
do not leave this house again

253
00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.620
without my permission.

254
00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:17.453
You got it?

255
00:26:18.866 --> 00:26:21.777
All right. it's bed time.

256
00:26:21.777 --> 00:26:22.610
Let's go.

257
00:26:55.728 --> 00:26:57.723
- Sheriff Clark.

258
00:26:57.723 --> 00:27:00.570
- Who called the press
to a tow truck scene?

259
00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:02.510
- Have you found Stanley yet?

260
00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:04.618
- How'd you find out about Mr. Jones?

261
00:27:04.618 --> 00:27:06.170
- It's a small town.

262
00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:08.240
There's no secrets in small towns.

263
00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:11.330
- Look. I haven't even
started the investigation yet.

264
00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:13.240
I'm still on the tow truck.

265
00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.800
- They're in an uproar.

266
00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.060
They want answers.

267
00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:17.570
- I don't care if they want answers.

268
00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:19.267
If I had answers. I'd give it to them.

269
00:27:19.267 --> 00:27:21.440
- You gotta give me something.

270
00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:23.645
- You're not my boss.

271
00:27:23.645 --> 00:27:25.170
Don't you have something better to do?

272
00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:26.833
- I'm not trying to be your boss.

273
00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:32.140
I'll let you handle your job.
take care of this tow truck.

274
00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:34.880
but you better give me a
call so I can handle mine.

275
00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.970
- You might wanna move that vehicle

276
00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:38.623
unless you wanna get impounded.

277
00:27:39.956 --> 00:27:42.206
(chuckles)

278
00:27:43.995 --> 00:27:46.662
(tires screech)

279
00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:09.650
- Thank you. Sheriff. we'll
get this back to the yard.

280
00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:11.843
- All right. Scott. I'll see you later.

281
00:28:17.647 --> 00:28:19.330
(phone rings)
- Captain Wright.

282
00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:20.970
- [Clark] Hey Captain.
this is Sheriff Clark

283
00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:23.290
here at the Sheriff's Office.

284
00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:26.240
I had a few reports of maybe something

285
00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.230
crashing into the ocean. or...

286
00:28:29.458 --> 00:28:31.959
I don't know. a boat on fire.

287
00:28:31.959 --> 00:28:33.527
Have you had any reports?

288
00:28:33.527 --> 00:28:35.040
- [Wright] No. we haven't had any calls

289
00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.440
for service in over a month.

290
00:28:37.416 --> 00:28:39.135
- [Clark] Can you do me a favor?

291
00:28:39.135 --> 00:28:42.240
Can you send a quick
patrol around the pier

292
00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.960
and the surrounding
area. look for any debris

293
00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.930
or any signs of a crash?

294
00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:51.670
- [Wright] I'll get the boys
together. send them out.

295
00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:53.400
- [Clark] Okay. I appreciate it.

296
00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.850
Hey. give me a holler back
if you find something.

297
00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:57.420
- Yes. sir.
- Okay.

298
00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:59.253
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

299
00:29:01.567 --> 00:29:04.484
(foreboding music)

300
00:29:39.508 --> 00:29:43.210
- You would not believe the
day at school I had today.

301
00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:46.500
Mrs. Bumstead got onto me
for falling asleep in class.

302
00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:47.970
but it wasn't my fault.

303
00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:50.403
I keep having nightmares about that alien.

304
00:29:51.698 --> 00:29:53.550
(sighs) I just don't
know what I'm gonna do.

305
00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:55.573
I've been too scared to tell my parents.

306
00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:01.710
- Well. I actually talked to the alien

307
00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:02.543
and met it.

308
00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.070
- What?

309
00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:08.070
- I went outside in the
middle of the night.

310
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:11.670
and it talked to me.

311
00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:14.810
It kept whispering inside my head.

312
00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:17.960
like. I honestly don't know.

313
00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.150
I've never heard anything like it before.

314
00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:22.633
It showed me something.

315
00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.300
I kind of felt like I had fallen asleep.

316
00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:29.120
but then woken up again in a split second.

317
00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:32.720
It was weird. but it didn't
really seem like the thing

318
00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.730
that I had met in my house.

319
00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:38.530
It didn't seem scary.

320
00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:42.580
I was scared at first. but I don't know.

321
00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:43.940
it wasn't threatening.

322
00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:45.620
- What do you mean. it wasn't threatening?

323
00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:48.013
It was an alien. it tried to kill me!

324
00:30:48.013 --> 00:30:49.820
Did you tell your dad?

325
00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:51.990
- I did tell him. but
he didn't believe me.

326
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:54.610
- Parents never believe anything.

327
00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:57.400
You've gotta get some proof or something.

328
00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:00.850
- Yeah. I know. but how
exactly do I get proof?

329
00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:02.860
- Well. see if it left a clue.

330
00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:05.130
or if you can find a footprint.

331
00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:08.090
And if you find anything.
then show it to your dad.

332
00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:11.690
- I guess. but he probably
still wouldn't believe me.

333
00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:15.030
Just accuse me of making it myself.

334
00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:17.920
What about you. did you tell
your parents what happened?

335
00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:19.770
- Are you crazy?

336
00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:22.490
No way. I haven't told them anything.

337
00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:25.040
- I guess I better get
inside and do my chores

338
00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.570
before my dad comes home tonight.

339
00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:28.450
- Yeah. I'm gonna get home too.

340
00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:30.370
I don't wanna be caught in the dark again.

341
00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:31.823
Make sure you lock your door.

342
00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:35.010
I've been make suring
all my doors are locked.

343
00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:36.483
Same thing with the windows.

344
00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.760
- All right. I'll see you
tomorrow after school.

345
00:31:43.695 --> 00:31:46.612
(foreboding music)

346
00:32:37.747 --> 00:32:39.166
- [Clark] Hey. this is the sheriff.

347
00:32:39.166 --> 00:32:41.180
Hey. shout at me on my cell phone.

348
00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:43.647
I'm gonna be out at the
state park for a little bit.

349
00:33:07.005 --> 00:33:09.505
(tense music)

350
00:35:28.174 --> 00:35:31.070
(eerie music)

351
00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:32.120
- I'm gonna call 911.

352
00:35:35.113 --> 00:35:37.113
- [Operator] 911. what's your emergency?

353
00:35:38.036 --> 00:35:38.869
- Yes.

354
00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:43.330
I just saw someone dash
across our yard in all black.

355
00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:47.600
I don't know who it was.
but I just saw someone.

356
00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:50.143
- [Operator] Just stay
inside. lock your door.

357
00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:52.880
What's your address. hon?

358
00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.430
- [Elizabeth] Five Ferris Street.

359
00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:56.950
- [Operator] I'll have the
sheriff come by immediately.

360
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:59.030
I'm gonna send him right over.

361
00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:00.030
- Thank you.

362
00:36:35.625 --> 00:36:36.650
The sheriff's here. Grandma.

363
00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:39.523
I'm gonna answer the door.
(knocking)

364
00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:42.410
Thanks for coming. Sheriff.

365
00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:44.690
- I came as quick as I
could. are you two okay?

366
00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:49.370
- Me and my grandma saw
someone in a black cloak

367
00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:51.150
dart across our yard.

368
00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:52.630
- A black cloak. okay.

369
00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:54.150
- We didn't know who it was.

370
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:57.810
and Grandma's still
really scared right now.

371
00:36:57.810 --> 00:37:01.090
- You two don't have to be
scared anymore. I'm here now.

372
00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:03.660
I didn't see anything when I walked up.

373
00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:06.470
I'm gonna do an extra
check around the perimeter.

374
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:09.957
and if it's all clear. I'm gonna
head back home for tonight.

375
00:37:09.957 --> 00:37:11.557
But if you need me. you call me.

376
00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:15.052
and I'll get right back as fast as I can.

377
00:37:15.052 --> 00:37:16.170
- Okay.

378
00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:18.257
Thank you.

379
00:37:18.257 --> 00:37:19.657
- You two have a good night.

380
00:37:26.167 --> 00:37:28.250
(knocks)

381
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:32.600
- [Laura] I came as soon as I heard.

382
00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:33.800
- Okay.

383
00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.890
- Ms. Anderson.

384
00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:38.870
- Have you been listening
to the scanner again?

385
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:40.270
- Guilty.

386
00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:41.320
- [Clark] Come on in.

387
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:46.123
Well. have a seat.

388
00:37:47.527 --> 00:37:51.540
- So she saw a black cloak.

389
00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:53.440
- You need to stop
listening to the scanner.

390
00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:56.153
I came out to Ms. Anderson's.

391
00:37:56.153 --> 00:37:58.640
No one was there. no
signs of a black cloak.

392
00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:01.570
There was no prowler.
there was nothing there.

393
00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:04.290
- Hey. that's in my amendment
rights. okay. buddy?

394
00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:05.853
I've been doing some research.

395
00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:09.250
I think it's aliens.

396
00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:11.564
- Look. there's no such thing as aliens.

397
00:38:11.564 --> 00:38:13.580
- I don't think you
should be that skeptical.

398
00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:15.930
- Can you and the town just
give me five minutes to relax?

399
00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:18.600
I just got home. I just got changed.

400
00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:19.980
I'm trying to finish some paperwork.

401
00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:23.105
and then here you come
talking about aliens.

402
00:38:23.105 --> 00:38:24.670
- What happened to Stanley?

403
00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:26.170
- I don't know what happened to Stanley.

404
00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:27.830
- Where's Magnar?

405
00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:29.470
Why was his car left there?

406
00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:31.800
- I don't know what happened to Magnar.

407
00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.360
- You were supposed to call me.

408
00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:35.750
and I told you I would be back.

409
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:38.053
- I got nothing to tell you.
why am I gonna call you?

410
00:38:38.053 --> 00:38:40.130
- Even if you don't
have anything to report.

411
00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:42.400
you could at least give me a courtesy call

412
00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:45.190
to say you don't have anything to report.

413
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:49.003
- I investigated the beach.
the woods. the park. nothing.

414
00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:51.483
- The town needs to know.

415
00:38:51.483 --> 00:38:53.450
What do you plan on telling them?

416
00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:54.880
- The town doesn't need to know.

417
00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.710
It's my discretion and
I don't want the town

418
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:57.980
to panic at all.

419
00:38:57.980 --> 00:38:59.830
- If you're not gonna tell anyone.

420
00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:02.210
what do you plan on doing about this?

421
00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:03.920
- I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

422
00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:07.820
Starting tomorrow. no one's
allowed out past 9 p.m.

423
00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:09.783
It's gonna be a new county curfew.

424
00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:13.900
The only one out should be me.

425
00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:15.103
- I'm gonna go home.

426
00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:20.980
But I'm telling you there are aliens.

427
00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:24.680
And aliens are here terrorizing this town.

428
00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:26.543
whether you wanna believe it or not.

429
00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.770
- I told you. I told you!

430
00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:30.820
I knew aliens were real.
- Mandy. what are you doing

431
00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:32.510
in here interrupting grownups?

432
00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:34.902
- See. I told him. I
knew aliens were real.

433
00:39:34.902 --> 00:39:36.400
- Here we go. aliens.

434
00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.560
- You believe me. right?

435
00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:39.020
- [Laura] Of course I do.

436
00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:40.530
- There's no such thing as aliens.

437
00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:43.200
I don't wanna hear this.
we're not doing this. you two.

438
00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.210
What were you doing.
eavesdropping again. Mandy?

439
00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:47.460
- Yes. I was eavesdropping.

440
00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:50.120
and I'm sorry for interrupting you two.

441
00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:51.710
- Mandy. back to your room.

442
00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:54.280
- I'll go to bed now.
- And you can leave.

443
00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:55.610
- Goodnight. Ms. Laura.

444
00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:57.623
- [Laura] Goodnight. I believe you.

445
00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:00.533
Okay. I'll leave.

446
00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:07.060
But don't expect me to leave you alone.

447
00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:08.201
(alarm beeps)

448
00:40:08.201 --> 00:40:11.118
(foreboding music)

449
00:40:30.943 --> 00:40:33.693
(radio chatters)

450
00:41:32.902 --> 00:41:35.235
- That woman has some nerve.

451
00:41:38.117 --> 00:41:39.963
Can never trust the press.

452
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:50.120
All right. Laura. I
read the article. yeah.

453
00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:53.080
- Tommy?
- Okay. you wanna be enemies?

454
00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:55.467
- [Laura] How'd you like it?
- No. this is the sheriff.

455
00:41:55.467 --> 00:41:57.010
- [Laura] You know we've been best friends

456
00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:58.340
since high school.

457
00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:00.380
What. you didn't have your coffee today?

458
00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:03.040
- Well look. I know you
came from Texas. okay.

459
00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:05.200
but we're not corrupt up here.

460
00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:07.250
We're honest law enforcement.

461
00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:08.580
We don't just make up charges

462
00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:10.380
and go around arresting people.

463
00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:12.210
You need probable cause.

464
00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:13.770
And I don't care who my friends are.

465
00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:16.430
I won't get a judge to sign anything

466
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:18.230
unless there's facts or evidence involved.

467
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:19.830
- [Laura] If you can't give me facts.

468
00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:21.030
what am I supposed to write about?

469
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:22.226
- I don't have anything. okay?

470
00:42:22.226 --> 00:42:23.360
- Don't be so sensitive.
- I still don't know what

471
00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:24.920
happened to Stanley or Magnar.
- Why don't you be

472
00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:25.950
like a real man?

473
00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:27.480
- I need to be a real man?

474
00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:30.110
Look. I'll show you who a real man is.

475
00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:32.270
I'm gonna prove to you and the town

476
00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:34.220
that I'm gonna take care of this issue.

477
00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:37.235
and that the town is safe.

478
00:42:37.235 --> 00:42:40.735
(melancholy guitar music)

479
00:43:13.906 --> 00:43:15.739
Why aren't you eating?

480
00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:18.523
- It's my fault Mom died.

481
00:43:20.326 --> 00:43:22.560
- What?

482
00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:24.660
Why would you think that?

483
00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:28.210
- The night before she
died. I had a dream.

484
00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:29.763
I saw her at the wheel.

485
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:36.000
And I saw her. she fell
asleep. and I saw the wreck.

486
00:43:37.350 --> 00:43:38.850
Her head was bleeding.

487
00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:43.253
and I didn't say anything.

488
00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:46.240
If I would have told you.

489
00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:48.740
you wouldn't have let her
go into work that night.

490
00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:51.563
She wouldn't have crashed.

491
00:43:52.439 --> 00:43:54.439
(sighs)

492
00:43:59.298 --> 00:44:00.948
- It's not your fault. it's mine.

493
00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:07.653
If I didn't spend so
many hours on the job.

494
00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:10.203
I would've been home more.

495
00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:12.320
I would've been here for her.

496
00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:14.570
I would've been helping
her around the house.

497
00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:19.190
She wouldn't have been so tired.

498
00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:25.970
Look. I know I need to spend
more time at the house.

499
00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:27.663
and not so much time at work.

500
00:44:29.271 --> 00:44:30.403
But it's a small town.

501
00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:34.083
I have to protect the town and my family.

502
00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:38.360
and it's not that easy to be
able to juggle both of those.

503
00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:44.960
And sometimes you lose
others on the other side.

504
00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:48.590
and sometimes you're gonna lose someone

505
00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:53.733
on this side. in your family.

506
00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:02.623
Look. I made a call.

507
00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:06.023
and I set up an
appointment for both of us.

508
00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:11.283
We're gonna head down to
Portman and get some counseling.

509
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:17.173
I think both of us need it.

510
00:45:18.453 --> 00:45:20.393
I guess it's time to call it a night.

511
00:45:22.415 --> 00:45:24.580
(phone rings)

512
00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:25.693
Spoke too soon.

513
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.280
I have to take this.

514
00:45:31.268 --> 00:45:32.237
Sheriff.

515
00:45:32.237 --> 00:45:34.150
- [Mike] This is Mike over at dispatch.

516
00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:35.530
We got a call coming in for you.

517
00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:38.290
- I just had a curfew.
no one out past 9 p.m.

518
00:45:38.290 --> 00:45:39.848
- [Mike] Yeah. I know. I know.

519
00:45:39.848 --> 00:45:41.897
but someone else has
gone missing. Sheriff.

520
00:45:41.897 --> 00:45:43.897
- Another person.
- Yeah.

521
00:45:45.214 --> 00:45:46.456
- Okay.
- Henry Stevens. sir.

522
00:45:46.456 --> 00:45:48.340
- Okay. I was just having
dinner with my daughter.

523
00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:49.495
Can you give me five minutes?

524
00:45:49.495 --> 00:45:51.193
- [Mike] I got a 101 on 4th Street.

525
00:45:51.193 --> 00:45:53.026
- Okay. I'll be there.

526
00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:01.130
I know I just said I'm
gonna start being home more.

527
00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:03.383
but I have to go.

528
00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:08.330
Another person went missing.

529
00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:15.490
You're gonna have to clean up.

530
00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:17.033
go to bed by yourself tonight.

531
00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:22.000
Lock up. wait till I get back.

532
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.133
Don't answer the door. don't go outside.

533
00:46:25.450 --> 00:46:26.283
Okay?

534
00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:29.713
I love you.

535
00:46:31.752 --> 00:46:34.252
(eerie music)

536
00:46:42.348 --> 00:46:43.871
- [Alien] Help me.

537
00:46:43.871 --> 00:46:46.788
(foreboding music)

538
00:47:00.035 --> 00:47:01.452
Help me.

539
00:48:05.347 --> 00:48:06.597
Help me.

540
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:50.023
- I hear you calling to me.

541
00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:53.153
I can understand you.

542
00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:57.447
Why do you keep coming to see me?

543
00:48:57.447 --> 00:49:01.745
- I need your help.
- How could I help you?

544
00:49:01.745 --> 00:49:03.920
- [Alien] Only you can hear me.

545
00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:06.688
- So I'm the only one
who can understand you.

546
00:49:06.688 --> 00:49:09.930
- [Alien] There is another who is evil.

547
00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:12.887
- You mean there's two of you?

548
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.331
You're not the one killing everyone?

549
00:49:16.331 --> 00:49:18.321
- [Alien] I do no harm.

550
00:49:18.321 --> 00:49:19.735
I come in peace.

551
00:49:19.735 --> 00:49:21.781
- You're the good one?
- My ship crashed

552
00:49:21.781 --> 00:49:22.690
in the ocean.

553
00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:25.333
- In the ocean. it crashed?

554
00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:28.850
That's what everybody was fussing about.

555
00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:30.570
That's what those lights in the sky were.

556
00:49:30.570 --> 00:49:33.803
- I am here to stop the evil one.

557
00:49:34.725 --> 00:49:36.710
- What do you want me to do?
- [Alien] Follow me.

558
00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:39.950
- But if you want me to follow you.

559
00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:41.570
you have to tell me where we're going.

560
00:49:41.570 --> 00:49:42.730
- [Alien] Trust me.

561
00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:45.880
- Okay. I believe you can protect me.

562
00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:47.933
I trust you.
- We must leave soon.

563
00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:50.970
- I'm ready to go. but we have to hurry

564
00:49:50.970 --> 00:49:53.950
before my dad gets back. because
he doesn't believe in you.

565
00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:56.253
and if he saw you. he would kill you.

566
00:49:56.253 --> 00:49:57.967
- I must destroy the evil one.

567
00:49:59.529 --> 00:50:03.980
And I need your help. because
your mind is the only one

568
00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:04.880
he cannot control.

569
00:50:07.733 --> 00:50:09.983
Together we can defeat him.

570
00:50:10.821 --> 00:50:11.654
Follow me.

571
00:50:16.158 --> 00:50:19.075
(foreboding music)

572
00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:51.093
- Mandy.

573
00:50:52.458 --> 00:50:55.143
I told that girl to stay in the house.

574
00:50:57.698 --> 00:51:00.781
What is she doing going in the woods?

575
00:51:17.112 --> 00:51:18.944
Mandy. Mandy!

576
00:51:18.944 --> 00:51:20.247
(tense music)

577
00:51:20.247 --> 00:51:22.283
- [Alien] He is here.

578
00:51:22.283 --> 00:51:23.950
Do not be afraid.

579
00:51:29.570 --> 00:51:30.970
- Why did you bring me here?

580
00:51:32.014 --> 00:51:32.847
- [Alien] I need your help.

581
00:51:34.986 --> 00:51:36.236
- What do I do?

582
00:51:37.368 --> 00:51:38.363
Just tell me something!

583
00:51:38.363 --> 00:51:40.913
What do you want me to
do against that thing?

584
00:51:42.434 --> 00:51:43.735
(yelps)

585
00:51:43.735 --> 00:51:45.317
No!

586
00:51:45.317 --> 00:51:46.417
- Mandy!

587
00:51:46.417 --> 00:51:49.417
(suspenseful music)

588
00:51:50.361 --> 00:51:52.611
- [Alien] Can't defeat him.

589
00:51:55.089 --> 00:51:57.256
(screams)

590
00:52:02.482 --> 00:52:05.065

591
00:52:14.568 --> 00:52:17.151
(Clark groans)

592
00:52:42.061 --> 00:52:44.940
(gun fires)

593
00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:47.750
(Clark groans)

594
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:49.417
- Mandy. Mandy!

595
00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:54.043
Are you okay?

596
00:53:02.007 --> 00:53:04.090
You saved my life. Mandy.

597
00:53:05.715 --> 00:53:08.010
We gotta get going.

598
00:53:08.010 --> 00:53:10.410
We gotta hide this thing.
I can't tell the town.

599
00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:13.383
I can't tell the town.

600
00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:16.383
I got a shovel in my pickup. come on.

601
00:53:24.370 --> 00:53:26.757
All right. we gotta bury him.

602
00:53:28.606 --> 00:53:30.456
I'm gonna go see. you stay back here.

603
00:53:31.753 --> 00:53:34.253
(tense music)

604
00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:40.213
All right. it's dead.

605
00:53:40.213 --> 00:53:41.046
It's dead.

606
00:53:50.972 --> 00:53:52.055
- She's gone.

607
00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:54.490
- [Clark] What do you mean she's gone?

608
00:53:54.490 --> 00:53:56.350
- She's not here anymore.

609
00:53:56.350 --> 00:53:58.070
- Where'd she go?

610
00:53:58.070 --> 00:54:01.590
- She was only here to make
sure the bad alien stopped.

611
00:54:01.590 --> 00:54:04.113
So now do you believe in aliens?

612
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:09.684
- No.
(Mandy laughs)

613
00:54:09.684 --> 00:54:11.103
I don't believe in aliens.

614
00:54:13.390 --> 00:54:14.543
We never had an alien.

615
00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:18.550
And the town is never gonna know.

616
00:54:20.110 --> 00:54:22.610
- Okay.
- There were no aliens.

617
00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:25.600
- No aliens.
- No aliens.

618
00:54:29.546 --> 00:54:32.463
(melancholy music)

619
00:54:44.138 --> 00:54:47.055
- [Alien] Thank you for helping me.

620
00:54:51.551 --> 00:54:53.634
- Dad. can we have a pet?

621
00:54:55.730 --> 00:54:57.920
- Sure. you can have a pet.

622
00:54:59.982 --> 00:55:01.930
Maybe it'll keep you in the house.

623
00:55:01.930 --> 00:55:04.243

625
00:56:10.627 --> 00:56:13.490
- [Man] You can't help
but try to figure it out.

626
00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:18.490

Daddy.

646
00:57:32.026 --> 00:57:35.853

your reaction to this movie?

(cries)

648
00:57:38.613 --> 00:57:42.285

I almost. I just wanna throw up almost.

00:58:26.237 --> 00:58:29.100
I don't know I'm gonna tell the wife.

659
00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:31.100
I'll check in with you when I can. okay?

660
00:58:32.028 --> 00:58:34.063

661

662
00:58:39.894 --> 00:58:42.851
- [Woman] There's been a
lot of activity going on.

663
00:58:42.851 --> 00:58:45.518
- [Man] I don't know what to do.

664
00:58:47.383 --> 00:58:51.383
- I heard some people

665
00:58:52.959 --> 00:58:54.587
do an exorcism on the house

666
00:58:54.587 --> 00:58:57.337
when something like this happens.

667
00:59:00.932 --> 00:59:03.682

(roaring)

680
01:00:02.158 --> 01:00:04.991
- [Man] Wise man once told me

681
01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:11.085
that a man searches his
whole life to find true love.

682
01:00:11.085 --> 01:00:13.434
(dramatic piano music)

683
01:00:13.434 --> 01:00:15.423
That love is sacrificial.

684
01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:20.600
And it is for love that a man

685
01:00:21.948 --> 01:00:24.558
would walk through Hell.

686
01:00:24.558 --> 01:00:26.076
Don't worry. the baby's gonna be fine.

687
01:00:26.076 --> 01:00:27.100
To keep it.

689
01:00:47.389 --> 01:00:50.257
- [Anna] Thanks for taking me on the trip.

690
01:00:50.257 --> 01:00:53.609
- This property should
be around here somewhere.

691
01:00:53.609 --> 01:00:55.442
Well. the map said so.

692
01:00:56.310 --> 01:00:58.599
It's worth the money. we have to take it.

693
01:00:58.599 --> 01:01:01.516
(foreboding music)

694
01:01:04.018 --> 01:01:05.101
- I love you.

695
01:01:07.018 --> 01:01:10.119
- I'm gonna go see if the door's open.

696
01:01:10.119 --> 01:01:11.202
I'll be back.
