00:23:07.951 --> 00:23:09.910
For the flashback. which one?

534
00:23:09.997 --> 00:23:11.302
- Neither.
- Both.

535
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.217
- Um. so. tomorrow's a big day.
- Yeah.

536
00:23:13.304 --> 00:23:15.481
And I'm thinking
for that scene. um--

537
00:23:15.568 --> 00:23:17.570
Okay. hold on a second. Trevor.
I've got to ask you something.

538
00:23:17.657 --> 00:23:19.136
- Alright.
- Tell me.

539
00:23:19.223 --> 00:23:20.486
Talk to me. I'm here.

540
00:23:20.573 --> 00:23:22.966
That girl today
from the audition.

541
00:23:23.053 --> 00:23:25.578
- The wild. muddy mess.
- Pig Girl?

542
00:23:25.665 --> 00:23:27.841
Don't...please don't
call her that.

543
00:23:27.928 --> 00:23:32.019
No. no. no! I don't call her
that. That's what they call her.

544
00:23:32.106 --> 00:23:33.760
They call her "Pig Girl."
I would never call her that.

545
00:23:33.847 --> 00:23:35.979
Look. listen. um..

546
00:23:36.066 --> 00:23:38.634
Do you think we can find
out who she is?

547
00:23:38.721 --> 00:23:40.897
- You think we should sue her?
- No.

548
00:23:40.984 --> 00:23:43.683
No. I. look. I-I-I just can't
get her out of my head.

549
00:23:45.685 --> 00:23:47.556
Why? You spent. like.
20 seconds with her.

550
00:23:47.643 --> 00:23:50.124
Okay. and it was the first
real 20 seconds I've had

551
00:23:50.211 --> 00:23:51.604
since I started this business.

552
00:23:55.651 --> 00:23:58.262
Aw. come on. man.

553
00:23:58.349 --> 00:24:00.395
You little sucker. come on.

554
00:24:00.482 --> 00:24:03.093
Okay. Trev. look. I-I-I don't
mean it like that. Alright?

555
00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.008
What I mean i-is this..

556
00:24:05.095 --> 00:24:06.749
...all of this nonsense

557
00:24:06.836 --> 00:24:09.404
alright. it does.
it doesn't speak to me.

558
00:24:09.491 --> 00:24:11.972
That beautiful girl back there
with the pig. she spoke to me.

559
00:24:14.148 --> 00:24:15.932
Okay. Jackson.

560
00:24:16.019 --> 00:24:19.153
Listen. you want to go frolic
in a pigsty..

561
00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.415
...I want that for you.

562
00:24:20.502 --> 00:24:22.548
I think it's important. okay?

563
00:24:22.635 --> 00:24:25.115
But right now we gotta focus.
It's a lot of pressure.

564
00:24:25.202 --> 00:24:26.508
This is a big movie
and we're going to do this

565
00:24:26.595 --> 00:24:28.641
because we're a team. right?

566
00:24:28.728 --> 00:24:30.338
We're going to finish
this movie

567
00:24:30.425 --> 00:24:33.646
and then you and I are gonna
dive into my next movie.

568
00:24:33.733 --> 00:24:36.257
And then. you are going to be
an A-list star

569
00:24:36.344 --> 00:24:39.782
and you can pick
any chick you want.

570

They all called me "Pig Girl."

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:03.502
Yeah.

579
00:25:05.591 --> 00:25:07.288

00:25:31.355 --> 00:25:33.401
You're lucky they didn't
ban us from auditioning

after your little stunt. Ow!

589
00:25:36.056 --> 00:25:38.362
You have any idea what a day
like that can cost production?

590
00:25:38.449 --> 00:25:40.408
100k. easy.

591
00:25:40.495 --> 00:25:43.237
Okay. well. they don't even
know that we're related. Kale.

592
00:25:43.324 --> 00:25:44.847
Okay. let's keep it that way.

593

- Stop!
- Hold still.

594
00:25:46.762 --> 00:25:48.285
If anyone finds out
you're Pig Girl

595
00:25:48.372 --> 00:25:49.548
you'll ruin it for all of us.

596

Wow.

00:25:52.115 --> 00:25:53.421

Okay. don't wait up for us.

602
00:26:03.126 --> 00:26:05.259
I'm sure we'll be invited
to the after-party.

Oh. there's no after-party.

604

finish the job.

There's something about it
that I just--

612
00:26:44.515 --> 00:26:45.691
- I'll be back.
- This is pretty cool.

literally said to me

that he never wants to see
my face again.

00:31:03.252 --> 00:31:04.993
[sniffles]

707
00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.168
Yeah.

708
00:31:14.873 --> 00:31:16.744
What? Sorry.

709
00:31:16.831 --> 00:31:19.965
That. that's it. That. that's
all I got for the monologue.

710
00:31:20.052 --> 00:31:22.402
[Finley clears throat]

711
00:31:22.489 --> 00:31:24.360
[applauding]

712
00:31:29.888 --> 00:31:31.280
[chuckles]

713
00:31:31.367 --> 00:31:32.716
- So..
- That's "Fuller House."

714
00:31:32.803 --> 00:31:35.806
That was. ah. that was
surprisingly good.

715
00:31:35.894 --> 00:31:37.634
Real nice work. man.

716
00:31:37.721 --> 00:31:39.288
That was my favorite
show growing up.

717
00:31:41.073 --> 00:31:42.726
What's your name. kid?

718
00:31:42.813 --> 00:31:45.381
Huh. Fin...Fin..

719
00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:48.602
[coughs]

720
00:31:48.689 --> 00:31:51.779
Uh. last name. Finn.

721
00:31:51.866 --> 00:31:53.302
First name. uh..

722
00:31:53.389 --> 00:31:57.045
[clears throat]
...Huckleberry?

723
00:31:57.132 --> 00:31:58.177
Yeah.

724
00:31:58.264 --> 00:31:59.874
You know. my-my parents were

725
00:31:59.961 --> 00:32:02.181
real Mark Twain fans. you know?
So..

726
00:32:02.268 --> 00:32:03.182
- Oh..
- Alright.

727
00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:05.314
You know. Yeah. yeah.

728
00:32:06.054 --> 00:32:08.143
But. um..

729
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:09.536
...you all can call me "Huck."

730
00:32:10.754 --> 00:32:12.669
- Okay.
- Huck.

731
00:32:14.889 --> 00:32:16.804
So. the following people
have been chosen

732
00:32:16.891 --> 00:32:18.066
Caletta Rose..

733
00:32:18.153 --> 00:32:19.285
[screaming]

734
00:32:19.372 --> 00:32:20.547
Great. Great. great. great.

735
00:32:20.634 --> 00:32:22.418
And. uh. Saffron Tremaine..

736
00:32:22.505 --> 00:32:23.637
[screaming]

737
00:32:23.724 --> 00:32:26.335
And Huck Finn.
Great.

738
00:32:26.422 --> 00:32:29.338
Oops. sorry. folks.
Hold tight. just a second.

739
00:32:29.425 --> 00:32:30.687
Yes?

740
00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.255
What?

741
00:32:34.648 --> 00:32:36.563
How?

742
00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:38.826
[instrumental music]

743
00:32:40.088 --> 00:32:42.134
- I can't wait..
- Ahh! A-ahem!

744
00:32:42.221 --> 00:32:43.483
To work you.

745
00:32:44.832 --> 00:32:47.182
You mean. work with me.

746
00:32:48.923 --> 00:32:50.272
Whatever.

747
00:32:53.058 --> 00:32:55.669
We lost the farm house.

748
00:32:55.756 --> 00:32:57.149
What do you mean
we lost the farm house?

749
00:32:57.236 --> 00:32:59.499
- Where did it go?
- It collapsed.

750
00:32:59.586 --> 00:33:01.501
I just saw it yesterday. Bernie.

751
00:33:01.588 --> 00:33:02.893
Well. it's gone today.

752
00:33:02.981 --> 00:33:04.591
We shoot the farm house
in two days!

753
00:33:04.678 --> 00:33:06.288
How are we going to
find another location?

754
00:33:06.375 --> 00:33:07.811
We're going to
figure something out.

755
00:33:07.898 --> 00:33:10.945
Ah-ah-ah!
If-if I may? Hi.

756
00:33:11.032 --> 00:33:13.121
Um. just happened to overhear.

757
00:33:13.208 --> 00:33:15.123
She's a patron of the arts.

758
00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:18.561
Yes. yes and I want
to proposition you.

759
00:33:21.173 --> 00:33:25.525
- She has a proposition for you.
- Yes.

760
00:33:25.612 --> 00:33:29.616
I just happen to be the owner of
a historical country farm house.

761
00:33:29.703 --> 00:33:31.444
True.

762
00:33:31.531 --> 00:33:37.711
And we have a barn. and a
chicken coop. chickens. goats

763
00:33:37.798 --> 00:33:40.018
filing cabinets.
hay. lots of hay..

764
00:33:40.105 --> 00:33:41.802
Big property.
It's a big property.

765
00:33:41.889 --> 00:33:43.760
The kind that you would need
for a production of this size.

766
00:33:43.847 --> 00:33:45.980
Brass tacks. boys.

767
00:33:46.067 --> 00:33:47.590
How much is it going
to cost me

768
00:33:47.677 --> 00:33:49.114
to have you shoot
your movie at my place?

769
00:33:49.201 --> 00:33:51.768
No. no. she's kidding.
she's kidding.

770
00:33:51.855 --> 00:33:53.727
They pay us. not
the other way around.

771
00:33:53.814 --> 00:33:55.903
Why don't we just say
that you give us. uh..

772
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:58.297
I don't know. 125 percent of
what you were going to pay

773
00:33:58.384 --> 00:34:02.823
the house that you lost. throw
in some...catered lunches

774
00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:05.347
hot. then you have
yourself a deal.

775
00:34:09.569 --> 00:34:10.786
Sure.

776
00:34:10.873 --> 00:34:13.181
[instrumental music]

777
00:34:25.193 --> 00:34:26.237
Guys!

778
00:34:28.327 --> 00:34:29.502
They're here.

779
00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:32.199
Saffron?

780
00:34:33.549 --> 00:34:34.594
Kale?

781
00:34:34.681 --> 00:34:36.726
[instrumental music]

782
00:34:44.864 --> 00:34:46.735
- Morning.
- Oh. have a seat. have a seat.

783
00:34:49.696 --> 00:34:51.610
[clears throat]

784
00:34:51.697 --> 00:34:54.657
You know. I actually
saw your last movie.

785
00:34:54.744 --> 00:34:56.659
- Oh. yeah?
- Yeah.

786
00:34:59.923 --> 00:35:01.186
- Okay.
- Seen the PR.

787
00:35:01.273 --> 00:35:02.796
That you're doing
for this one here.

788
00:35:02.883 --> 00:35:04.058
It's my house. actually.

789
00:35:04.145 --> 00:35:07.583
Oh. You got a real
nice piece of land.

790
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:10.412
- Say. how many horses do you..
- I don't know.

791
00:35:10.499 --> 00:35:12.936
I figure I should
be managing you.

792
00:35:13.023 --> 00:35:14.590
- How's that?
- Well. do you have a manager?

793
00:35:14.677 --> 00:35:16.114
- I do not.
- You do now.

794
00:35:18.464 --> 00:35:19.813
What type of managing
do you do?

795
00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:21.902
Ever heard of Wanda's Waffle
and Sushi House?

796
00:35:21.989 --> 00:35:23.425
I can't say I've
had the pleasure.

797
00:35:23.512 --> 00:35:25.297
You will.
Listen. are you a meat guy?

798
00:35:25.384 --> 00:35:27.690
You could be the face
of Jon Ham Bacon.

799
00:35:27.777 --> 00:35:29.605
It's kind of a side
project I'm working on.

800
00:35:29.692 --> 00:35:32.260
Look. I. um. I don't think
I really need a manager.

801
00:35:32.347 --> 00:35:34.784
Not a meat guy?
Surprising.

802
00:35:34.871 --> 00:35:36.482
Uh. how about tractors?

803
00:35:36.569 --> 00:35:38.788
I'm working on a deal
with a local company here.

804
00:35:38.875 --> 00:35:40.442
Uh. thank you. but no.

805
00:35:40.529 --> 00:35:41.878
No. Okay moving on.
moving on.

806
00:35:41.965 --> 00:35:43.184
I got you. though.
I got you with this one?

807
00:35:43.271 --> 00:35:45.752
- Hmm?
- Money.

808
00:35:45.839 --> 00:35:48.233
Everybody likes money. right?
I'm in with the banks.

809
00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.409
"Need a loan.
call Jackson Stone."

810
00:35:50.496 --> 00:35:52.280
This is all from my head. man.
I'm just winging it.

811
00:35:52.367 --> 00:35:53.455
- I'm winging it. man.
- Wow.

812
00:35:53.542 --> 00:35:55.327
- Apologies. apologies.
- Okay. yup.

813
00:35:57.155 --> 00:35:58.504
You're a little all over
the place. ain't ya?

814
00:36:01.376 --> 00:36:03.596
You need an animal like me
in your corner. Jackson.

815
00:36:04.945 --> 00:36:06.033
Hmm.

816
00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:08.775
[sighs]

817
00:36:12.431 --> 00:36:13.432
Let's do this.

818
00:36:13.519 --> 00:36:14.781
[cellphone chimes]

819
00:36:19.742 --> 00:36:21.788
[sighing]

820
00:36:21.875 --> 00:36:24.573
Wish me luck. Jon Ham.
Love you.

821
00:36:25.966 --> 00:36:27.228
Okay. Jackson.

822
00:36:27.315 --> 00:36:29.752
So. you just shot
all these guys.

823
00:36:29.839 --> 00:36:31.406
Pow. pow. pow. pow. pow.

824
00:36:31.493 --> 00:36:32.842
- And now you're out of ammo.
- Hmm.

825
00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.931
Right? Okay.

826
00:36:35.018 --> 00:36:37.151
And from behind you
comes this guy.

827
00:36:37.238 --> 00:36:40.067
- Yeah. Hey. buddy.
- Kenny.

828
00:36:40.154 --> 00:36:42.722
Okay. A one-on-one.
So. uh. Kenny?

829
00:36:42.809 --> 00:36:44.158
You just. you just grab him.

830
00:36:44.245 --> 00:36:45.290
Okay. How do you want me
to approach it?

831
00:36:45.377 --> 00:36:47.161
I could do. like. a step over

832
00:36:47.248 --> 00:36:49.859
toe-hold sleeper. or-or I could
do a figure-four arm lock.

833
00:36:49.946 --> 00:36:52.558
Yeah. that-that's great.
You just go for him.

834
00:36:52.645 --> 00:36:55.996
Just...just come for me. Kenny.

835
00:36:56.083 --> 00:36:57.867
That's hot. that's hot.
that's hot. that's hot.

836
00:36:57.954 --> 00:37:00.130
- No. uh. um..
- Hi!

837
00:37:00.218 --> 00:37:03.438
I'm just not really
comfortable winging it.

838
00:37:05.048 --> 00:37:06.224
Okay.

839
00:37:07.225 --> 00:37:08.313
Fine.

840
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:11.229
Huck!

841
00:37:11.316 --> 00:37:12.578
Huck. hey. Hello?

842
00:37:14.188 --> 00:37:16.059
Oh. Ahem.

843
00:37:16.146 --> 00:37:18.714
Yeah. uh. I'm so.
so sorry. folks.

844
00:37:18.801 --> 00:37:21.587
Huck. Huck is here.
Yeah.

845
00:37:21.674 --> 00:37:22.892
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

846
00:37:22.979 --> 00:37:24.242
Uh. you ever do any stunts?

847
00:37:25.199 --> 00:37:27.288
Oh. yeah.

848
00:37:27.375 --> 00:37:30.117
Two. two years
of gymnastics. so.

849
00:37:30.204 --> 00:37:32.598
That's. that's good.
Uh. go for him.

850
00:37:32.685 --> 00:37:34.469
Uh. he's not.
he's not in the union...

851
00:37:34.556 --> 00:37:35.862
No. that's fine.
Thanks. Kenny.

852
00:37:35.949 --> 00:37:37.255
Just go.
Just go for him.

853
00:37:37.342 --> 00:37:39.387
Uh-uh. okay.

854
00:37:39.474 --> 00:37:40.649
- Yeah. Right now?
- Yeah.

855
00:37:40.736 --> 00:37:41.868
- Alright.
- From back there.

856
00:37:41.955 --> 00:37:43.304
Yeah.

857
00:37:44.436 --> 00:37:45.611
- Ready?
- Yes. I am.

858
00:37:45.698 --> 00:37:46.786
Ready.

859
00:37:48.962 --> 00:37:50.485
- Yeah.
- That's perfect.

860
00:37:50.572 --> 00:37:52.095
- That's great. that's great.
- Alright.

861
00:37:52.182 --> 00:37:54.620
Oh. well. i-it's okay.
You see. I could do that!

862
00:37:54.707 --> 00:37:56.361
I just thought you
wanted something..

863
00:37:56.448 --> 00:37:58.711
- Mm-hmm.
- Good.

864
00:37:58.798 --> 00:38:01.061
Actually. I'm thinking.
Kenny. maybe you. uh

865
00:38:01.148 --> 00:38:02.628
might want to have
a break there.

866
00:38:02.715 --> 00:38:04.847
- Cool. Cool. cool. cool. cool.
- Yeah. yeah.

867
00:38:04.934 --> 00:38:07.110
Yeah. It's probably tired from
all that work. Thanks. buddy.

868
00:38:09.939 --> 00:38:13.595
Uh. thank you. you know.
for going easy on me.

869
00:38:13.682 --> 00:38:16.381
Ah. well. you know.
I got little cousins

870
00:38:16.468 --> 00:38:17.643
we used to play fight
all the time.

871
00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:19.297
That's all this is.
you know?

872
00:38:19.384 --> 00:38:22.212
- Yeah.
- Anyhow. you're a lightweight.

873
00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.389
What do you weigh?
About 130-135?

874
00:38:24.476 --> 00:38:26.129
123. thank..

875
00:38:26.216 --> 00:38:29.829
[clears throat]
Thank you very much.

876
00:38:29.916 --> 00:38:32.527
- That was a joke.
- I gotcha.

877
00:38:32.614 --> 00:38:34.355
You were so good.

878
00:38:34.442 --> 00:38:35.878
[Trevor]
'Let's shoot this.'

879
00:38:35.965 --> 00:38:38.533
And remember. we're going
to do this in a one-er.

880
00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:41.188
Which means we're going to shoot
the whole scene in one shot.

881
00:38:41.275 --> 00:38:44.322
Okay? Everyone. remember here.
timing is everything.

882
00:38:44.409 --> 00:38:46.062
So. if even one piece
of the puzzle is off

883
00:38:46.149 --> 00:38:47.281
the whole thing falls apart.

884
00:38:47.368 --> 00:38:48.717
So that's. so. what is

885
00:38:48.804 --> 00:38:50.415
what is that?
Is that a phone?

886
00:38:50.502 --> 00:38:52.939
- Bernie. Bernie. Bernie!
- Phones off! Please!

887
00:38:53.026 --> 00:38:54.549
- Come on. guys.
- Sorry. guys. Sorry.

888
00:38:54.636 --> 00:38:56.508
- That's alright. We get it.
- All good.

889
00:38:56.595 --> 00:38:59.032
So. Jackson. I want you
to enter from over there. okay?

890
00:38:59.119 --> 00:39:01.295
And. Huck. uh. you can
go around the corner

891
00:39:01.382 --> 00:39:04.298
and wait for your cue. okay?
Now. listen. don't miss this.

892
00:39:04.385 --> 00:39:06.387
If you miss it. you're going
to screw up the whole take

893
00:39:06.474 --> 00:39:08.041
and then I'll have to beat
the crap out of you.

894
00:39:10.391 --> 00:39:12.350
[chuckles]
I'm joking. I'm joking.

895
00:39:12.437 --> 00:39:14.526
But I will fire you.

896
00:39:14.613 --> 00:39:16.832
So there's that.
you could get fired.

897
00:39:16.919 --> 00:39:18.660
- That's not a joke.
- No. that one's not joking.

898
00:39:18.747 --> 00:39:20.096
- Yes.
- Okay. good. Good luck.

899
00:39:20.183 --> 00:39:21.881
See you on the other side.
Here we go.

900
00:39:21.968 --> 00:39:23.143
Let's try one.

901
00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:26.059
Okay. lock it up!
Roll sound!

902
00:39:28.496 --> 00:39:29.584
Oh. my gosh.

903
00:39:29.671 --> 00:39:31.194
- 'And action.'
- Hi. Okay.

904
00:39:31.281 --> 00:39:33.501
I know I look
very. very strange.

905
00:39:33.588 --> 00:39:36.243
I'm going to have to do
this real quick.

906
00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:39.202

916

[Valerian]
Where are you?
Where have you been?

917
00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:17.371
You told me to milk the cow.
so I'm milking the cow.

918
00:40:17.458 --> 00:40:18.677
Is that what you're doing?

919
00:40:18.764 --> 00:40:20.983
- Yeah.
- That is disgusting.

920
00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:23.943
Yeah. Yeah.

921
00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:25.335
You know what? It only gets

922
00:40:25.423 --> 00:40:26.772
really worse from here.
so you should probably

923
00:40:26.859 --> 00:40:29.905
just go. like. right now.
Like. right now!

924
00:40:29.992 --> 00:40:32.952
- You should go.
- Fine. I'm leaving.

925
00:40:33.039 --> 00:40:35.171
There's got to be a better
way to get the milk out.

'Hi!'

That's what I'm talking about.

00:42:46.302 --> 00:42:48.130
I'm sorta freaking out
that Trevor let me do

975
00:42:48.217 --> 00:42:50.350
that scene with you.

976
00:42:50.437 --> 00:42:53.875
Listen. listen. He let you
do it because you're good.

977
00:42:53.962 --> 00:42:55.529
Alright. you're not afraid
to just go for it.

978

Oh. ah..

Hmm.

Man..

992
00:43:38.137 --> 00:43:41.401
You must just wake up and pinch
yourself every single day.

993
00:43:43.708 --> 00:43:45.013
Now how's that?

I-I mean. you-you get to travel
the world. you know. for free.

of every single actor.

these great parts

working with the
best directors.

998

- It's..
- Hmm.

999
00:43:59.419 --> 00:44:02.422
Nah. look the truth is..

1000
00:44:04.293 --> 00:44:05.904
...I'd give all this up

1001
00:44:05.991 --> 00:44:07.688
to be back at my uncle's ranch.

Hey. Jackson. I'm sorry.
I. I gotta ask. um..

1006
00:44:24.662 --> 00:44:26.272
How did you get here?

1007
00:44:27.577 --> 00:44:29.536
Ah. well. ah..

1008
00:44:31.059 --> 00:44:33.671

and his wife showed up

1010

Now I got two more movies
lined up after this one. and..

1012
00:44:42.854 --> 00:44:45.073

is get back on the ranch. so..

1013

gonna do. right?

00:47:09.174 --> 00:47:11.437
So. whaddya got goin'

1054
00:47:12.264 --> 00:47:14.222
[chuckles]

1055
00:47:14.309 --> 00:47:17.008
Day off? I. um..

1056
00:47:17.095 --> 00:47:19.271
I haven't really had one
of those in a real long time.

1057
00:47:19.358 --> 00:47:21.403
Hmm. Nah. look. look. look

1058
00:47:21.490 --> 00:47:23.101
you gotta take advantage of 'em.

1059
00:47:23.188 --> 00:47:25.755
Alright? These long days on set
will catch up with you.

1060
00:47:25.843 --> 00:47:27.888
[Bernie]
'Please do not play
with your prop guns.'

1061
00:47:27.975 --> 00:47:30.935
[Jackson]
'Well. I'm going
to sleep in tomorrow'

1062
00:47:31.022 --> 00:47:32.501
and then I'm going
to check out this town.

1063
00:47:33.415 --> 00:47:34.721
I like it here.

1064
00:47:36.505 --> 00:47:37.811
[Bernie]
'Let's do this!'

1065
00:47:37.898 --> 00:47:39.813
'Let's get this show
on the road!'

1066
00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:41.380
[Trevor]
'Okay. full out
on this rehearsal here.'

1067
00:47:41.467 --> 00:47:42.860
'Nice. with the legs.'

1068
00:47:42.947 --> 00:47:45.514
Then we cut to Saffron.
She sexy-walks in.

1069
00:47:45.601 --> 00:47:46.907
We'll fix that later.

1070
00:47:46.994 --> 00:47:48.604
Then steady-cam onto the piano

1071
00:47:48.691 --> 00:47:51.694
pushing to the saloon girls.
Slide up the leg.

1072
00:47:51.781 --> 00:47:53.131
And now we're doing
a Busby Berkeley.

1073
00:47:53.218 --> 00:47:54.262
- Busby Berkeley.
- Bugsy..

1074
00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:56.047
B-Busby Berkeley.

1075
00:47:56.134 --> 00:47:58.136
[Trevor]
Then the piano flies out..
Whoosh! Good!

1076
00:47:58.223 --> 00:47:59.702
Then we whip-pan
right to these guys.

1077
00:47:59.789 --> 00:48:00.921
Give me that wheel kick.

1078
00:48:01.008 --> 00:48:02.618
'Then we clap it. Laser focus.'

1079
00:48:02.705 --> 00:48:03.663


1080
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:05.273
'Saffron sees him.'

1081
00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:07.885
'She's going to do
some sexy-time with the hands.'

1082
00:48:07.972 --> 00:48:11.149
'This is weird.
Now they kiss. Ah!'

1083
00:48:11.236 --> 00:48:13.586
'Now Kenny's got the lasso
finale. Okay?' The lasso..'

1084
00:48:13.673 --> 00:48:15.893
'Kenny. you've got to have
that lasso spinning. Kenny.'

1085
00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:18.069
You gotta.. Oh. cut!

1086
00:48:18.156 --> 00:48:19.200
[Kenny]
'That was close. though.'

1087
00:48:19.287 --> 00:48:21.115
Kenny. it-it was a mess. man.

1088
00:48:21.202 --> 00:48:22.900
No. no. no. no. no.
I got. I got it. I got it.

1089
00:48:22.987 --> 00:48:24.249
I just have to..

1090
00:48:24.336 --> 00:48:26.294
...make the knot tighter.

1091
00:48:26.381 --> 00:48:28.993
Uh. a-actually. all you gotta do
is loosen the hondu.

1092
00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:30.864
[laughs]
Okay. I think..

1093
00:48:30.951 --> 00:48:32.692
I think I know a little bit more
about stunt-roping

1094
00:48:32.779 --> 00:48:36.174
than this guy.
Right. Mr. Gymnastics?

1095
00:48:36.261 --> 00:48:37.871
Hey. Kenny.

1096
00:48:37.958 --> 00:48:40.047
Uh. Huck's right. You gotta..

1097
00:48:40.134 --> 00:48:41.831
You gotta loosen the hondu.

1098
00:48:41.919 --> 00:48:43.442
Okay. Huck. could.. Huck.

1099
00:48:43.529 --> 00:48:44.747
Could you come down here
and please

1100
00:48:44.834 --> 00:48:45.966
just do this for us. please?

1101
00:48:46.053 --> 00:48:48.316
Uh. yeah. sure.

1102
00:48:48.403 --> 00:48:49.535
[clears throat]

1103
00:48:51.493 --> 00:48:54.148
I'm just..

1104
00:48:54.235 --> 00:48:56.237
Uh. I'm just going to take it
for a second.

1105
00:48:56.324 --> 00:48:58.065
[Trevor]
Kenny?

1106
00:48:58.152 --> 00:48:59.893
Let go of the rope. Kenny.

1107
00:49:01.155 --> 00:49:03.114
Like. letting go.

1108
00:49:03.201 --> 00:49:04.898
And you're buh-bying.

1109
00:49:04.985 --> 00:49:06.247
'Thank you. Strong work. Kenny.'

1110
00:49:06.334 --> 00:49:07.727
If you could just step on back.

1111
00:49:10.034 --> 00:49:11.949
So. whaddya- whaddya want
from him?

1112
00:49:12.036 --> 00:49:13.341
Whaddya got?

1113
00:49:13.428 --> 00:49:16.170
[instrumental music]

1114
00:49:16.257 --> 00:49:17.345
Well. uh..

1115
00:49:17.432 --> 00:49:18.520
Ahem.

1116
00:49:18.607 --> 00:49:20.087
Usually. I like to start off

1117
00:49:20.174 --> 00:49:22.524
with a little bit
of a Texas Foot Stomp.

1118
00:49:28.052 --> 00:49:30.619
And then. uh.
when I'm done with that

1119
00:49:30.706 --> 00:49:32.056
I usually like to kick it off

1120
00:49:32.143 --> 00:49:34.536
with a little bit
of a Round The World.

1121
00:49:34.623 --> 00:49:36.060
[Trevor]
'Oh. yeah. I love that. yeah.'

1122
00:49:36.147 --> 00:49:37.583
[Bernie]
'Oh. yeah!'

1123
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:39.672
And then I usually
like to finish things off

1124
00:49:39.759 --> 00:49:41.543
by going back
into The Wedding Ring.

1125
00:49:43.632 --> 00:49:46.505
[all cheering]

1126
00:49:52.685 --> 00:49:54.817
He's like that girl
from the audition.

1127
00:49:54.904 --> 00:49:56.297
That girl wishes
she could do that.

1128
00:49:56.384 --> 00:49:58.604
Huck. buddy. that was insane.

1129
00:49:58.691 --> 00:50:01.085
Y-you keep surprising me.
I'm telling you.

1130
00:50:01.172 --> 00:50:02.956
[Finley]
You'd be surprised
how surprising I could be.

1131
00:50:03.043 --> 00:50:04.653
Kenny. you switch with Huck.

1132
00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:07.395
Uh. and. Huck. let's start
with the kiss.

1133
00:50:07.482 --> 00:50:10.268
What? What?

1134
00:50:10.355 --> 00:50:12.531
[Bernie]
Okay. people. we're starting
with the kiss.

1135
00:50:12.618 --> 00:50:13.793
[Trevor]
Yeah. big smooch. Let's do it.

1136
00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:15.012
Right. right. We're gonna..

1137
00:50:15.099 --> 00:50:16.970
Oh! Ahem! Hello.

1138
00:50:17.057 --> 00:50:19.059
Well. yeah. We're gonna..

1139
00:50:19.146 --> 00:50:21.322
What if. what if.. Hear me out.

1140
00:50:21.409 --> 00:50:23.194
What if we do the kiss. you know

1141
00:50:23.281 --> 00:50:24.891
after rehearsal. you know

1142
00:50:24.978 --> 00:50:26.936
once we're saving it. you know

1143
00:50:27.024 --> 00:50:29.026
for-for when the cameras
are-are rolling.

1144
00:50:29.113 --> 00:50:30.810
- You know?
- That's funny. Okay. let's go.

1145
00:50:32.029 --> 00:50:33.334
Anytime.

1146
00:50:33.421 --> 00:50:36.076
I just. I-I-I
I don't really know if..

1147
00:50:36.163 --> 00:50:37.556
He's probably
never kissed a girl before.

1148
00:50:37.643 --> 00:50:39.210
What? No!

1149
00:50:39.297 --> 00:50:40.733
No. Kenny.

1150
00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:42.387
I have kissed..

1151
00:50:43.475 --> 00:50:45.738
...tons of. of. of girls

1152
00:50:45.825 --> 00:50:47.392
ladies before.

1153
00:50:47.479 --> 00:50:49.307
Uh. like. so many.

1154
00:50:49.394 --> 00:50:51.657
So. so. so many. Uh..

1155
00:50:51.744 --> 00:50:54.703
...including my-my cousin..

1156
00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:56.444
Okay..

1157
00:50:56.531 --> 00:50:59.143
[Jackson]
Look. look. um. I get it.

1158
00:50:59.230 --> 00:51:00.796
I get it. alright?
It's weird to just

1159
00:51:00.883 --> 00:51:02.624
jump in and kiss
a total stranger.

1160
00:51:02.711 --> 00:51:04.278
Yeah! Yeah. yeah. yeah. Yeah.

1161
00:51:04.365 --> 00:51:06.150
That's-that's-that's
exactly what I'm saying.

1162
00:51:06.237 --> 00:51:08.152
That-that is the only reason
that this is..

1163
00:51:08.239 --> 00:51:09.457
That this is

1164
00:51:09.544 --> 00:51:10.893
well. weird.

1165
00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:12.243
[Jackson]
'Well-well. I'd say'

1166
00:51:12.330 --> 00:51:13.983
you just do a cheat kiss.

1167
00:51:14.071 --> 00:51:15.507
You don't even gotta touch.

1168
00:51:15.594 --> 00:51:17.509
A cheat kiss?
That-that's amazing.

1169
00:51:17.596 --> 00:51:18.510
Yeah. let's do.
let's do a cheat kiss.

1170
00:51:18.597 --> 00:51:20.033


1171
00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:21.556
That-that sounds like. uh..
we should do it.

1172
00:51:21.643 --> 00:51:23.993
- I mean. Trevor--
- No. no. no.

1173
00:51:24.081 --> 00:51:25.691
Guys. I can't have any of that

1174
00:51:25.778 --> 00:51:26.996
fake crap on my set.

1175
00:51:27.084 --> 00:51:28.259
I need authenticity.

1176
00:51:28.346 --> 00:51:30.130
I have to have the real deal.

1177
00:51:30.217 --> 00:51:32.524
And here I am. Kiss me. Huck.

1178
00:51:32.611 --> 00:51:33.786
And you can. like .
really go for it.

1179
00:51:33.873 --> 00:51:35.962
Like. hey. totally go for it.

1180
00:51:36.049 --> 00:51:37.311
Right. right.

1181
00:51:37.398 --> 00:51:38.878
All the. all the things
you need to do.

1182
00:51:38.965 --> 00:51:40.184
- Yeah.
- I'm here for it.

1183
00:51:40.271 --> 00:51:41.576
Alright. yeah.

1184
00:51:41.663 --> 00:51:43.491

00:51:44.971 --> 00:51:46.451
I'm gonna go for it right now.

1187
00:51:46.538 --> 00:51:48.192
I'm gonna.. Kenny. your rope.

1188
00:51:48.279 --> 00:51:50.411


1189
00:51:50.498 --> 00:51:52.674
Trevor. I'm just gonna

00:51:57.897 --> 00:51:59.333
Be right.. Oh my God!

1193
00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:00.769
What am I doing freaking out?

1194
00:52:00.856 --> 00:52:02.510
I can't do this. I just..

1195
00:52:02.597 --> 00:52:04.208
This is so..
You're fine. you're fine.

1196
00:52:04.295 --> 00:52:05.861
You're just gonna

Go in there and just gonna Huck

Huck. just grab her

1203
00:52:19.745 --> 00:52:20.920
Right.

1204
00:52:21.747 --> 00:52:23.966
Okay. Okay.

1205
00:52:24.793 --> 00:52:25.794
[sighs]

1206
00:52:25.881 --> 00:52:27.492
Anytime now.

1207
00:52:27.579 --> 00:52:30.103
[breathing deeply]

1208
00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:33.106
[dramatic music]

1209
00:52:40.157 --> 00:52:42.115
Oh. God..

1210
00:52:42.202 --> 00:52:43.551
That was so..

1211
00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:46.511
I loved that.

1212
00:52:46.598 --> 00:52:48.382
Yeah. that was weirdly hot

1213
00:52:48.469 --> 00:52:50.167
yet not hot.

1214
00:52:50.254 --> 00:52:51.603
- So we're good?
- 'Yeah.'

1215
00:52:51.690 --> 00:52:52.995
Let's do one again
for the camera

1216
00:52:53.082 --> 00:52:53.996
so they can see it.

1217
00:52:54.083 --> 00:52:55.694
Yeah!

1218
00:52:55.781 --> 00:52:58.087
- One more time?
- Anytime.

1219
00:52:59.263 --> 00:53:01.178
[doorbell rings]

1220
00:53:09.011 --> 00:53:10.317
She's here.

1221
00:53:13.581 --> 00:53:15.017
Come in!

1222
00:53:15.931 --> 00:53:18.934
Oh. hello.

1223
00:53:19.021 --> 00:53:21.241
So. this is the main house.

1224
00:53:21.328 --> 00:53:23.243
[chuckles]

But if you take a little lookie.

1396
01:00:11.433 --> 01:00:12.913
[snorts]Right?

1397
01:00:14.436 --> 01:00:15.742


1398
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:17.875
but I think you'll see
where I'm going with it.

1399
01:00:17.962 --> 01:00:19.790
- I see something.
- Mm-hmm. yeah.

1400
01:00:19.877 --> 01:00:21.618
Okay. listen. um..

1401
01:00:21.705 --> 01:00:23.750
- Hey. Kale?
- Yeah. buddy?

1402
01:00:23.837 --> 01:00:25.143
Who is that girl over there?

1403
01:00:28.189 --> 01:00:29.974
[Kale]
'Oh. God. why?'

1404
01:00:30.061 --> 01:00:33.151
Well. I think that's the girl
from the audition. no?

1405
01:00:33.238 --> 01:00:34.631
Oh. yes. Yeah.

1406
01:00:34.718 --> 01:00:36.284
Yeah. That's Pig Girl.

1407
01:00:36.371 --> 01:00:37.938
Just a muddy little nobody.

1408
01:00:38.025 --> 01:00:39.374
Tragic. really.

1409
01:00:39.461 --> 01:00:41.725
Listen. I-I-I think
I hear them calling for me.

1410
01:00:41.812 --> 01:00:43.857
Alright? You hold onto this.
I-I love the idea.

1411
01:00:43.944 --> 01:00:45.729
Wonderful work.
I'll catch up with you later.

1412
01:00:45.816 --> 01:00:46.947
I was just hoping
maybe you'd take a look

1413
01:00:47.034 --> 01:00:49.689
at this contract that I drew up.

1414
01:00:49.776 --> 01:00:51.082
[Jackson]
'Hey. hey. hey. hold on now.'

1415
01:00:51.169 --> 01:00:52.257
Hold on to this water
for me. too. bud.

1416
01:00:52.344 --> 01:00:53.737
Thanks. I'll be right with you.

1417
01:00:53.824 --> 01:00:55.042
Well. I'll hold that.
I'll be right here.

1418
01:00:55.129 --> 01:00:56.435
And she rides. too.

1419
01:00:56.522 --> 01:00:57.784
[Finley]
You want me? Come and get me.

1420
01:00:59.177 --> 01:01:01.266
- Hold on.
- 'Come on. boy.'

1421
01:01:01.353 --> 01:01:02.746
Let's go. Come on. boy.

1422
01:01:02.833 --> 01:01:04.095
Let's go. Come on.

1423
01:01:04.182 --> 01:01:06.184
[horse neighs]

1424
01:01:06.271 --> 01:01:08.142
Come on. let's go. Come on. Hey.

1425
01:01:10.405 --> 01:01:13.278
[instrumental music]

1426
01:01:18.892 --> 01:01:20.285
[Jackson]
Come on. Hyah! Hyah!

1427
01:01:25.246 --> 01:01:26.334
[Jackson]
Hyah! Come on.

1428
01:01:27.596 --> 01:01:28.989
[Finley]
Come on. boy.

1429
01:01:29.076 --> 01:01:30.382
[Jackson]
Hey. hey. hold up!

1430
01:01:32.166 --> 01:01:35.039
[horses galloping]

1431
01:01:38.825 --> 01:01:40.435
It's okay. it's okay.
it's alright.

1432
01:01:43.308 --> 01:01:44.613
Who are you?

1433
01:01:46.485 --> 01:01:48.226
I think we might have
a little bit of a problem

1434
01:01:48.313 --> 01:01:50.228
with Jackson and Finley.

1435
01:01:50.315 --> 01:01:52.273
The only problem we have

1436
01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:54.362
is that you haven't managed
to sign him yet.

1437
01:01:54.449 --> 01:01:56.277
God. mom. that is so unfair.

1438
01:01:56.364 --> 01:01:57.931
He's impossible to get to.

1439
01:01:58.018 --> 01:01:59.977
He's either on set working
or hanging out with Huck.

1440
01:02:00.064 --> 01:02:01.935
I'm starting to honestly think
that those two might be..

1441
01:02:02.022 --> 01:02:03.328
...you know.
which would be very cute.

1442
01:02:03.415 --> 01:02:06.026
Um. that is totally ridiculous.

1443
01:02:06.113 --> 01:02:08.246
I happen to know
Huck is into girls

1444
01:02:08.333 --> 01:02:11.031
because when he kissed me.
it was so..

1445
01:02:13.294 --> 01:02:15.775
Right. There's also something
fishy going on

1446
01:02:15.862 --> 01:02:17.168
between Finley and Huck.

1447
01:02:17.255 --> 01:02:18.647
[chuckles]
Okay.

1448
01:02:18.735 --> 01:02:21.694
Huck would never
be interested in Finley!

1449
01:02:21.781 --> 01:02:24.001
I didn't say
Huck was interested in Finley

1450
01:02:24.088 --> 01:02:25.742
I said Jackson was.

1451
01:02:27.569 --> 01:02:30.007
[Valerian]
Oh! Oh..

1452
01:02:30.094 --> 01:02:31.922
I don't think we need to worry

1453
01:02:32.009 --> 01:02:34.489
about the Pig Girl.

1454
01:02:34.576 --> 01:02:37.579
Okay. listen. I can only hear
one conversation at a time.

1455
01:02:37.666 --> 01:02:40.104
Does anyone have eyes
on Jackson and Huck?

1456
01:02:41.235 --> 01:02:42.454
Alright.

1457
01:02:44.108 --> 01:02:46.588
There we go. there we go.

1458
01:02:46.675 --> 01:02:47.851
It's okay. Oh! Ow!

1459
01:02:49.156 --> 01:02:52.029
Come on. Come on. Attaboy.

1460
01:02:52.116 --> 01:02:54.466
Ah. she got away from us
this time.

1461
01:02:54.553 --> 01:02:57.512
That's alright.
We'll get her next time.

1462
01:02:57.599 --> 01:02:58.992
You're a good horse.

1463
01:03:01.081 --> 01:03:03.431
You're a good boy. alright?

1464
01:03:03.518 --> 01:03:05.390
You're alright. You just shied
away from that jump today.

1465
01:03:05.477 --> 01:03:07.261
It's okay.

1466
01:03:07.348 --> 01:03:08.959
'I can teach you.'

1467
01:03:09.046 --> 01:03:11.526
'You know. I had a gelding
just like you back home.'

1468
01:03:11.613 --> 01:03:13.006
How about a treat?

1469
01:03:13.093 --> 01:03:14.312
Let's get you a treat.

1470
01:03:17.054 --> 01:03:18.359
Yeah. these will do.

1471
01:03:20.927 --> 01:03:22.276
What do you say. hmm?

1472
01:03:22.363 --> 01:03:25.976
Yeah. There you go.

1473
01:03:26.063 --> 01:03:28.413
I can do almost everything.
but I can't control the weather

1474
01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:31.024
so just get me
a rain-cover set ASAP.

1475
01:03:31.111 --> 01:03:32.634
- Bernie!
- Oh!

1476
01:03:32.721 --> 01:03:34.549
Okay. I've got Huck.

1477
01:03:34.636 --> 01:03:37.988
I still need a 20 on Jackson.
Trevor's been looking for you.

1478
01:03:38.075 --> 01:03:39.990
Please don't wander off
like that again. okay?

1479
01:03:40.077 --> 01:03:42.122
Yeah. I won't.
I am so sorry about that. Sorry.

1480
01:03:42.209 --> 01:03:43.907
- Go talk to him.
- Oh. everything. though..

1481
01:03:43.994 --> 01:03:45.517
- Everything is great.
- Okay.

1482
01:03:48.259 --> 01:03:50.130
- Jackson.
- Hey. where ya been?

1483
01:03:50.217 --> 01:03:52.567
Where have you been?

1484
01:03:52.654 --> 01:03:54.004
I've just been
checking out the property.

1485
01:03:54.091 --> 01:03:56.310
Mm. yeah. it's a..

1486
01:03:56.397 --> 01:03:58.617
...real nice piece of land.

1487
01:03:58.704 --> 01:04:00.401
Beautiful. you could say. yeah.

1488
01:04:00.488 --> 01:04:02.099
Yeah. real beautiful.

1489
01:04:02.186 --> 01:04:04.318
I'd like to find me
a place like this some day.

1490
01:04:04.405 --> 01:04:05.798
That would be real nice.
real nice.

1491
01:04:05.885 --> 01:04:07.365
Jackson? Huck?

1492
01:04:07.452 --> 01:04:09.323
- Mm?
- Let's huddle up.

1493
01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:11.325
I heard "Huddle up."
That's me. right?

1494
01:04:11.412 --> 01:04:12.936
You guys need me for this one?

1495
01:04:13.023 --> 01:04:14.589
No. Kenny. we're fine.

1496
01:04:14.676 --> 01:04:15.982
- Yeah. let's go.
- Alright.

1497
01:04:17.027 --> 01:04:18.202
Alright.

1498
01:04:21.466 --> 01:04:22.859
[clears throat]

1499
01:04:24.599 --> 01:04:26.036
Okay.

1500
01:04:26.123 --> 01:04:27.559
Ah-ah-ah!

1501
01:04:31.345 --> 01:04:33.695
The chemistry
between you two on camera..

1502
01:04:34.696 --> 01:04:37.351
...is-is-is magical.

1503
01:04:39.310 --> 01:04:41.138
It's weird.

1504
01:04:43.401 --> 01:04:46.360
So. I'm going to take
a chance on you. Huck.

1505
01:04:46.447 --> 01:04:48.449
I'm giving you the part
that I was going to give Kenny.

1506
01:04:50.538 --> 01:04:52.149
So..

1507
01:04:52.236 --> 01:04:54.629
...this is
for the big finale scene.

1508
01:04:55.456 --> 01:04:57.763
Take it.

1509
01:04:57.850 --> 01:04:59.678
Now. we have
a company day off tomorrow

1510
01:04:59.765 --> 01:05:02.333
so you go home. you work hard.
you memorize those lines

1511
01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:04.117
and don't be late again.

1512
01:05:04.204 --> 01:05:06.728
- No!
- Alright.

1513
01:05:06.815 --> 01:05:08.817
No. no. sir. I-I won't.

1514
01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:11.733
I promise.
This is everything to me.

1515
01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:13.953
Well. well. you can thank
your pal. Jackson. here

1516
01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:15.433
because it was his idea.

1517
01:05:17.174 --> 01:05:18.566
There it is. Good luck!

1518
01:05:18.653 --> 01:05:20.090
Bernie. shut it down.

1519
01:05:20.177 --> 01:05:21.656
- 'Okay. we are moving on.'
- See you. Trev.

1520
01:05:22.744 --> 01:05:24.050
Ahem.

1521
01:05:27.053 --> 01:05:29.099
- Jackson. uh..
- What's up?

1522
01:05:31.188 --> 01:05:32.929
Thank you.

1523
01:05:33.016 --> 01:05:35.061
I don't even know what to say.

1524
01:05:35.148 --> 01:05:36.976
No thanks needed.

1525
01:05:37.063 --> 01:05:40.023
Ah. look. I-I owe you.

1526
01:05:40.110 --> 01:05:42.547
Look. you saved me from having
to do the scene with Kenny.

1527
01:05:42.634 --> 01:05:44.462
Alright?

1528
01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:46.943
Uh. I-I really shouldn't
laugh at that

1529
01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:49.902
because I really feel bad
for the poor guy. you know?

1530
01:05:49.989 --> 01:05:51.512
Right.

1531
01:05:52.383 --> 01:05:53.645
Uh..

1532
01:05:54.428 --> 01:05:55.690
Huck. y-y-your..

1533
01:05:55.777 --> 01:05:57.562
your-your mustache
is a little askew.

1534
01:06:00.173 --> 01:06:01.653
Yeah.

1535
01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:02.959
Oh. um..

1536
01:06:05.787 --> 01:06:07.093
[chuckles]

1537
01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:10.618
You know. Huck. I. uh

1538
01:06:10.705 --> 01:06:12.011
I figured as much.

1539
01:06:19.888 --> 01:06:21.194
You did?

1540
01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:23.066
Yeah.

1541
01:06:25.372 --> 01:06:26.983
You can't grow facial hair.

1542
01:06:27.070 --> 01:06:28.288
So what?

1543
01:06:30.247 --> 01:06:33.032
Yeah. yeah. Uh..

1544
01:06:33.119 --> 01:06:35.687
I-I can't grow facial hair. I..

1545
01:06:35.774 --> 01:06:37.689
Oh. it feels good to get that
off my chest. you know that?

1546
01:06:37.776 --> 01:06:39.343
- You got that.
- Alright.

1547
01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:41.258
It's 'cause I got such a.
such a babyface.

1548
01:06:41.345 --> 01:06:42.911
You know what I mean?
To get the part

1549
01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:44.391
I had to. had to look the part

1550
01:06:44.478 --> 01:06:46.698
but. you know. you got me.

1551
01:06:46.785 --> 01:06:48.961
Well. look. you're lucky.

1552
01:06:49.048 --> 01:06:51.398
I'll tell you what. I feel like
I'm shaving this every day

1553
01:06:51.485 --> 01:06:53.183
morning. noon and night.
you know what I'm saying?

1554
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:55.228
- One day.
- Right. right.

1555
01:06:55.315 --> 01:06:56.882
Well. I'll tell you what. look

1556
01:06:56.969 --> 01:06:59.363
your secret's safe with me.
Okay?

1557
01:06:59.450 --> 01:07:01.321
Alright. That's good news.
yeah.

1558
01:07:01.408 --> 01:07:02.583
I'll catch you later.

1559
01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:03.976
- Thank you.
- See you. bud.

1560
01:07:07.458 --> 01:07:08.589
[sighs]

1561
01:07:10.156 --> 01:07:11.462
Oh. God.

1562
01:07:12.332 --> 01:07:13.638
Oh. my God.

1563
01:07:14.987 --> 01:07:17.033
[instrumental music]

1564
01:07:18.556 --> 01:07:20.166
The best part is that
even though

1565
01:07:20.253 --> 01:07:22.516
the lighting was really bad
the selfie was still really good

1566
01:07:22.603 --> 01:07:23.952
and I just felt like.
I don't know--

1567
01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:26.346
I. I am. I was gonna go
fishing tomorrow

1568
01:07:26.433 --> 01:07:28.957
since. you know.
it's my day off. Sorry.

1569
01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:30.220
You don't have a day off.

1570
01:07:31.482 --> 01:07:33.266
I meant your day off.

1571
01:07:33.353 --> 01:07:35.747
- Of filming. you know?
- Oh.

1572
01:07:35.834 --> 01:07:37.009
I'll make breakfast first.

1573
01:07:37.096 --> 01:07:38.837
- I want French Toast.
- Okay.

1574
01:07:38.924 --> 01:07:40.839
Fine. whatever.
Just stop talking.

1575
01:07:40.926 --> 01:07:42.058
Okay.

1576
01:07:43.581 --> 01:07:45.626
Saffron. if the director

1577
01:07:45.713 --> 01:07:47.367
pegged you as "Talent"

1578
01:07:47.454 --> 01:07:49.152
why hasn't he given you
a bigger part?

1579
01:07:49.239 --> 01:07:50.501
Mm!

1580
01:07:50.588 --> 01:07:52.459
You don't know anything. mom.

1581
01:07:52.546 --> 01:07:55.288
This is how
the film business works.

1582
01:07:55.375 --> 01:07:58.335
Oh. I know
how monkey business works.

1583
01:07:58.422 --> 01:08:00.859
What?

1584
01:08:00.946 --> 01:08:04.123
Boys like Jackson
are only after one thing.

1585
01:08:04.210 --> 01:08:05.864
[Finley]
That is not true!

1586
01:08:05.951 --> 01:08:07.648
What is not true?

1587
01:08:07.735 --> 01:08:09.911
How would youeven know?

1588
01:08:09.998 --> 01:08:11.696
Yes. Finley. How would you?

1589
01:08:12.697 --> 01:08:14.786


1590
01:08:14.873 --> 01:08:17.267
Because I. um..

1591
01:08:19.486 --> 01:08:22.184
I overheard
Jackson and Huck talking

1592
01:08:22.272 --> 01:08:24.100
when they were by the barn

1593
01:08:24.187 --> 01:08:25.274
and they said
the director thinks

1594
01:08:25.362 --> 01:08:26.885
Saffron is really talented

1595
01:08:26.971 --> 01:08:28.495
and he wants
to make her part bigger.

1596
01:08:28.582 --> 01:08:30.018
[laughs]

1597
01:08:30.106 --> 01:08:31.497
[Valerian]
I knew it.

1598
01:08:31.585 --> 01:08:33.413
Yeah. I don't buy it.

1599
01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:35.415
I mean. no offense.
but we've all seen you act.

1600
01:08:35.502 --> 01:08:37.068
Don't be jelly.

1601
01:08:37.156 --> 01:08:39.593
Kale. she's right.

1602
01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:41.769
It's not about
how you play the game

1603
01:08:41.856 --> 01:08:43.902
it's about
whether or not you win.

1604
01:08:43.988 --> 01:08:46.252
Potato potato.

1605
01:08:46.339 --> 01:08:48.166
You do know
you have to say them differently

1606
01:08:48.254 --> 01:08:49.690
for that phrase to work. right?

1607
01:08:51.170 --> 01:08:54.085
[instrumental music]

1608
01:09:00.048 --> 01:09:02.964
[Finley singing softly]

1609
01:09:09.406 --> 01:09:10.885
[Jackson]
Do you mind if I join you?

1610
01:09:10.971 --> 01:09:12.452
I'm so sorry!
I didn't know you were..

1611
01:09:14.411 --> 01:09:16.978
Um..

1612
01:09:17.065 --> 01:09:19.023
Do you know. the. uh.
the-the-the fish

1613
01:09:19.111 --> 01:09:21.460
they just they're-they're really
not biting over here at all.

1614
01:09:21.548 --> 01:09:24.029
I think if you. you know.
go up the lake a little bit

1615
01:09:24.116 --> 01:09:26.596
like way down.
it would be better.

1616
01:09:26.684 --> 01:09:29.381
Yeah. I think
I'll. uh. take my chances.

1617
01:09:32.429 --> 01:09:33.473
Great.

1618
01:09:35.606 --> 01:09:36.781
Um..

1619
01:09:37.912 --> 01:09:39.435
Okay. well. um..

1620
01:09:39.523 --> 01:09:41.002
have a. have a good day.

1621
01:09:41.089 --> 01:09:42.874
- You leaving already?
- Yeah. yeah.

1622
01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:44.657
- Is it something I said?
- No. No. no.

1623
01:09:44.745 --> 01:09:47.226
Uh. no. no you. uh. you are..

1624
01:09:47.313 --> 01:09:49.576
..fine. I. um..

1625
01:09:49.663 --> 01:09:52.405
Good luck. you know.
with. uh. everything.

1626
01:09:52.492 --> 01:09:53.841
Come on. now.
please don't go.

1627
01:09:53.928 --> 01:09:56.148
I-I have to.
You know. I forgot my bait.

1628
01:09:56.235 --> 01:09:57.496
You mean this bait?

1629
01:10:00.457 --> 01:10:01.545
Yup.

1630
01:10:02.327 --> 01:10:04.678
Yup. that. um..

1631
01:10:04.764 --> 01:10:07.507
That'll be the one.
If you could just. you know..

1632
01:10:07.594 --> 01:10:10.815
- Just right. Yeah.
- Thank you.

1633
01:10:10.902 --> 01:10:12.295
Now you're probably wishing
you had that horse

1634
01:10:12.382 --> 01:10:13.600
right about now. huh?

1635
01:10:16.429 --> 01:10:17.822
And you're probably
thinking to yourself

1636
01:10:17.909 --> 01:10:19.780
"Can I outrun him?"

1637
01:10:19.867 --> 01:10:21.304
I don't think so.

1638
01:10:21.391 --> 01:10:22.434
Look..

1639
01:10:23.871 --> 01:10:26.004
I know it's you.

1640
01:10:26.091 --> 01:10:28.441
- It isn't me.
- Yeah. it is.

1641
01:10:28.528 --> 01:10:30.094
- No. it isn't--
- Yes. it is.

1642
01:10:30.182 --> 01:10:32.271
- No. it isn't!
- Yes. it is.

1643
01:10:32.358 --> 01:10:34.273
Fine.

1644
01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:35.621
Yes. it's me.

1645
01:10:37.885 --> 01:10:39.278
I'm so embarrassed right now.

1646
01:10:39.365 --> 01:10:40.540
Embarrassed?

1647
01:10:41.454 --> 01:10:42.499
For what?

1648
01:10:43.848 --> 01:10:47.068
Sorry. do you not remember me?

1649
01:10:47.155 --> 01:10:49.245
I'm the girl
that fell flat on her face

1650
01:10:49.332 --> 01:10:51.202
when she was trying
to wrangle her pig.

1651
01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:54.337
And I thought that was
some mighty fine pig wrangling.

1652
01:10:54.424 --> 01:10:56.513
Okay. I wasn't there
to wrangle a pig.

1653
01:10:57.905 --> 01:11:00.125
I was there to get
a part in your movie.

1654
01:11:00.212 --> 01:11:01.735
Well. look.

1655
01:11:01.822 --> 01:11:04.041
You're-you're going to get
another shot.

1656
01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:07.654
Yeah. a plain girl
from Dreary. Idaho

1657
01:11:07.741 --> 01:11:09.352
isn't getting another chance.

1658
01:11:11.832 --> 01:11:13.443
Man..

1659
01:11:13.530 --> 01:11:15.445
Look at me. Go on.

1660
01:11:18.273 --> 01:11:20.014
There is nothing plain
about you.

1661
01:11:23.366 --> 01:11:25.063
Now. will you come sit
and fish with me?

1662
01:11:27.326 --> 01:11:29.067
I was here first. so.

1663
01:11:32.897 --> 01:11:34.942
Yeah. keep staring at me.
I'll sell you both.

1664

1665

Shouldn't you be.
like. a sandwich

1675
01:12:06.887 --> 01:12:07.844

that I could do that

So. we're going to go
with Kenny.

1923
01:24:36.897 --> 01:24:38.029
Mm-hmm.

1924
01:24:39.074 --> 01:24:40.423
We gotta shoot.

1925
01:24:40.510 --> 01:24:41.815
[Trevor]
I understand. Bernie.

1926
01:24:41.902 --> 01:24:43.861
Oh. this is your chance!

1927
01:24:43.948 --> 01:24:45.384
Really?

1928
01:24:45.471 --> 01:24:47.343
- Get over there.
- Really?

1929
01:24:47.430 --> 01:24:49.475
Don't blow it again.

1930
01:24:49.562 --> 01:24:51.521
[grunts]

1931
01:24:51.608 --> 01:24:52.957
You're very hard on her.

1932
01:24:56.395 --> 01:24:58.353
- Hi!
- Hi..

1933
01:24:58.441 --> 01:24:59.659
Howdy. howdy. howdy.

1934
01:24:59.746 --> 01:25:01.139
Oh. Ew.

1935
01:25:01.226 --> 01:25:02.967
Listen. now is really
not the time.

1936
01:25:03.054 --> 01:25:04.795
Oh. but. um..

1937
01:25:04.882 --> 01:25:06.188

to make my part bigger..

1938
01:25:06.275 --> 01:25:07.276
...and yes.

1939
01:25:07.362 --> 01:25:08.625
I'm sorry. what?

1940
01:25:08.712 --> 01:25:10.105
No. no. that's right.
that's right.

1941
01:25:10.192 --> 01:25:12.019
You mentioned that.
Uh. you guys discuss

that right now. alright?
I'm gonna go..

1943
01:25:13.412 --> 01:25:15.284
You're not. Don't do this to me.

1946
01:25:25.468 --> 01:25:26.512
What?

1947
01:25:27.818 --> 01:25:29.124
Are you..

1948
01:25:30.777 --> 01:25:32.127
What is that?

1949
01:25:33.867 --> 01:25:35.391
Again. I want to say

1953
01:25:41.092 --> 01:25:42.833
My mom would like
to discuss the game plan

1954
01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:44.443
for selling the property.

1955
01:25:44.530 --> 01:25:45.879
Things have changed. and..

1956
01:25:45.966 --> 01:25:48.708

[Bernie]
We're just waiting
on one more cast member.

1958
01:25:51.276 --> 01:25:52.364
Hey. Huck?

...youare my hero.

1969
01:26:27.530 --> 01:26:28.835
It's showtime.

1970

[dramatic music]

1977
01:26:47.985 --> 01:26:49.029
Yes!

[set bell rings]

1979
01:26:50.553 --> 01:26:51.728
And..

1980
01:26:52.946 --> 01:26:53.947
...action!

1981
01:26:55.906 --> 01:26:58.169
Everything you said was a lie.

1982
01:26:59.431 --> 01:27:01.781
It may've been a lie. Billy..

1983
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.480
...but..

1984
01:27:04.567 --> 01:27:06.438
Uh. but. uh..

1985
01:27:08.048 --> 01:27:09.833
I am so sorry. I. I..

1986
01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:11.094
Can I get the line?
Can we go back?

1987
01:27:11.182 --> 01:27:12.749
I forgot. I forgot the line.

1988
01:27:12.835 --> 01:27:14.794
- Going again!
- 'Sorry.'

1989
01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:16.231
[panting]

[instrumental music]

01:27:27.242 --> 01:27:28.721
[Trevor]
And..

1992
01:27:28.808 --> 01:27:29.853
...action!

1993
01:27:32.159 --> 01:27:34.335
Everything you said was a lie.

1994
01:27:35.511 --> 01:27:36.816
Oh..

1995
01:27:36.903 --> 01:27:39.341
It may have been a lie.
Billy. but..

1996
01:27:39.428 --> 01:27:40.559
Oh!

1997
01:27:40.646 --> 01:27:42.257
[all gasp]

1998
01:27:42.344 --> 01:27:43.996
Aah!

1999
01:27:44.084 --> 01:27:45.041
I think that's broken.

2000
01:27:45.129 --> 01:27:46.304
[groans]

2001
01:27:49.133 --> 01:27:50.874
- That was close.
- Ooh!

2002
01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:53.442
Don't touch him. He's fine.

2003
01:27:53.529 --> 01:27:55.357
Your. uh. your-your tooth.

2004
01:27:56.358 --> 01:27:57.359
Gone.

2005
01:27:59.448 --> 01:28:00.710
Is it noticeable?

2006
01:28:02.842 --> 01:28:04.931
- Let's go again.
- Go.. Uh..

2007
01:28:05.018 --> 01:28:06.281
- He's missing a tooth.
- I don't care.

2008
01:28:06.368 --> 01:28:09.022
We didn't establish teeth.
Get him up!

2009
01:28:09.109 --> 01:28:10.894
Okay. let me go again.

2010
01:28:10.981 --> 01:28:12.635
- Up you go.
- 'Up I go.'

2011
01:28:12.722 --> 01:28:14.767
Yup. Oh. Kenny's alright.

2012
01:28:14.853 --> 01:28:17.466
Coach. we're okay.

2013
01:28:17.553 --> 01:28:19.032
I-I got this.
I'll just go again.

2014
01:28:19.119 --> 01:28:20.425
[Trevor]
'Okay.'

2015
01:28:20.512 --> 01:28:21.948
I'm going to make you proud!

2016
01:28:22.035 --> 01:28:24.081
'Okay. Ooh. I feel good.'

2017
01:28:24.168 --> 01:28:25.996
- Okay. we should go.
- Okay. let's go. then.

2018
01:28:26.083 --> 01:28:27.344
Here we go. and rolling.

2019
01:28:27.432 --> 01:28:28.955
Rolling!

2020
01:28:30.522 --> 01:28:31.480
Action.

2021
01:28:31.567 --> 01:28:33.612
Everything you said was a lie.

2022
01:28:35.092 --> 01:28:36.528
[gagging]

2023
01:28:36.615 --> 01:28:39.487
[retching]

2024
01:28:41.490 --> 01:28:43.273
- We got this. we got this.
- This isn't going to work.

2025
01:28:43.361 --> 01:28:44.406
It's going to work.

2026
01:28:45.145 --> 01:28:46.321
Ugh..

2027
01:28:46.930 --> 01:28:48.844
No.

2028
01:28:48.932 --> 01:28:50.150
[Bernie]
'Should we cut?'

2029
01:28:50.237 --> 01:28:51.587
No. we're not going to cut.

2030
01:28:51.674 --> 01:28:53.240
Give him the line again. please.

2031
01:28:53.327 --> 01:28:55.286
- Really?
- Yes. Yes. sir. Yes. sir.

2032
01:28:55.373 --> 01:28:56.505
Okay. Uh..

2033
01:28:58.637 --> 01:29:01.423
Everything you said was a lie.

2034
01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:03.207
[Finley as Huck]
'It may have been
a lie. Billy..'

2035
01:29:07.733 --> 01:29:09.300
It's all been a lie.

2036
01:29:12.956 --> 01:29:15.306
[as Finley]
But I never meant to hurt you.

2037
01:29:15.393 --> 01:29:16.742
What's going on with his voice?

2038
01:29:19.005 --> 01:29:21.486
I should have told you

2039
01:29:21.573 --> 01:29:22.791
at the lake.

2040
01:29:24.315 --> 01:29:26.969
Lake? What lake? What lake?

2041
01:29:27.057 --> 01:29:29.451
Right. we shoulda..

2042
01:29:29.538 --> 01:29:32.454
We shoulda talked at the lake.

2043
01:29:32.541 --> 01:29:34.064
But I was too afraid to.

2044
01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:37.067
I was..

2045
01:29:37.154 --> 01:29:38.764
...too scared of..

2046
01:29:41.201 --> 01:29:42.550
...what might happen.

2047
01:29:44.248 --> 01:29:45.597
Is he taking off his clothes?

2048
01:29:46.990 --> 01:29:48.905
But I am sick

2049
01:29:48.992 --> 01:29:51.081
and tired..

2050
01:29:51.168 --> 01:29:52.778
...of being afraid.

2051
01:29:55.868 --> 01:29:57.566
You know our friend. Huck..

2052
01:29:59.045 --> 01:30:00.743
...he made me realize

2053
01:30:00.830 --> 01:30:03.398
that I could either
stay invisible..

2054
01:30:05.661 --> 01:30:07.314
...or I could be remarkable.

2055
01:30:09.099 --> 01:30:11.406
So. if coming clean..

2056
01:30:12.581 --> 01:30:14.234
...means losing everything..

2057
01:30:20.371 --> 01:30:21.719
[gasps]

2058
01:30:21.807 --> 01:30:23.940
...then it just wasn't
in the cards.

2059
01:30:25.637 --> 01:30:27.552
[chuckles]

2060
01:30:27.639 --> 01:30:28.771
Who are you?

2061
01:30:32.601 --> 01:30:33.776
That's a good question.

2062
01:30:35.778 --> 01:30:38.041
Some people call me "Pig Girl."

2063
01:30:39.956 --> 01:30:42.088
My daddy. though. he called me
"Princess."

2064
01:30:45.483 --> 01:30:49.139
All I know is that
I have got one chance..

2065
01:30:49.226 --> 01:30:51.663
...and even if I end up
with mud on my face

2066
01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:53.360
I am going to take it.

2067
01:30:56.625 --> 01:30:57.582
Jackson..

2068
01:30:59.366 --> 01:31:01.499
I'm so sorry
that I didn't tell you sooner.

2069
01:31:03.066 --> 01:31:04.023
Um..

2070
01:31:06.809 --> 01:31:08.201
This is a lot to take in.

2071
01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:10.508
Yeah. I know.

2072
01:31:13.250 --> 01:31:14.556
Can you forgive me?

2073
01:31:17.036 --> 01:31:18.210
I don't know.

2074
01:31:23.521 --> 01:31:26.175
[instrumental music]

2075
01:31:28.918 --> 01:31:30.659
And cut!

2076
01:31:30.746 --> 01:31:32.574
Yes!

2077
01:31:32.661 --> 01:31:34.139
[Trevor]
'Okay. I don't know
what that was.'

2078
01:31:34.227 --> 01:31:35.794
I don't know what that was.
but I'm loving that.

2079
01:31:35.880 --> 01:31:37.666
I am.. Oh!

2080
01:31:37.753 --> 01:31:38.928
You..

2081
01:31:39.014 --> 01:31:40.320
...are extraordinary.

2082
01:31:42.192 --> 01:31:44.150
I thought you were a.. Um..

2083
01:31:44.237 --> 01:31:45.761
- But you're a. you're a--
- 'Girl!'

2084
01:31:45.848 --> 01:31:48.023
- Yeah.
- A badass girl.

2085
01:31:48.111 --> 01:31:49.591
[Kenny]
'I knew it!'

2086
01:31:49.678 --> 01:31:50.896
I knew there was something
weird about--

2087
01:31:50.983 --> 01:31:52.681
Shut up. Kenny.

2088
01:31:52.768 --> 01:31:54.552
I'm gonna put you
in my next movie.

2089
01:31:55.553 --> 01:31:56.772
The one starring Jackson.

2090
01:31:59.383 --> 01:32:01.166
You're not putting her anywhere.

2091
01:32:05.693 --> 01:32:08.261
You can't stop me from going.
Valerian.

2092
01:32:08.348 --> 01:32:10.481
Well. I guess if you want
to say goodbye..

2093
01:32:10.568 --> 01:32:12.048
...to your childhood home.

2094
01:32:14.702 --> 01:32:16.705
And the first thing to go..

2095
01:32:16.791 --> 01:32:19.142
...will be that little pig.

2096
01:32:19.228 --> 01:32:21.361
Straight to the slaughterhouse.

2097
01:32:23.362 --> 01:32:25.148
I don't really think
that you would do that.

2098
01:32:27.150 --> 01:32:29.413
Because I think
that there is a heart

2099
01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:31.110
in there somewhere. Valerian.

2100
01:32:34.374 --> 01:32:36.159
- For crying out loud. Louise?
- 'Yeah?'

2101
01:32:36.246 --> 01:32:38.335
Please.

2102
01:32:38.422 --> 01:32:40.076
- 'Louise?'
- Yes?

2103
01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:45.081
We'll take the first offer
you get.

2104
01:32:46.996 --> 01:32:50.041
Well. I'd have to get the
owner's approval to do that.

2105
01:32:50.129 --> 01:32:51.348
I just gave it to you.

2106
01:32:51.434 --> 01:32:53.132
'Oh. well. after our meeting..'

2107
01:32:53.219 --> 01:32:55.134
I did some digging
and it turns out

2108
01:32:55.221 --> 01:32:59.138
that Mr. Tremaine left
the property to his daughter.

2109
01:32:59.225 --> 01:33:01.401
He left it to me?

2110
01:33:01.487 --> 01:33:02.620
[scoffs]
Not you.

2111
01:33:02.707 --> 01:33:04.187
His real daughter.

2112
01:33:04.273 --> 01:33:05.884
So. you'd have to ask her.

2113
01:33:11.585 --> 01:33:12.848
Is that true. Louise?

2114
01:33:12.934 --> 01:33:13.892
It is.

2115
01:33:15.807 --> 01:33:16.982
So. you're saying..

2116
01:33:17.068 --> 01:33:18.723
You've got squat.

2117
01:33:21.246 --> 01:33:22.684
Ahh..

2118
01:33:22.771 --> 01:33:25.208
I want this more than anything.

2119
01:33:27.166 --> 01:33:28.254
You guys have no idea

2120
01:33:28.341 --> 01:33:31.170
but I. I can't leave my farm

2121
01:33:31.257 --> 01:33:32.476
my animals. my home--

2122
01:33:32.563 --> 01:33:34.826
Hold on now.

2123
01:33:34.913 --> 01:33:36.523
I might be able to help you out
there.

2124
01:33:36.611 --> 01:33:38.830
- Hey. Trev?
- 'Yeah?'

2125
01:33:38.916 --> 01:33:39.918
Come here. bud.

2126
01:33:40.005 --> 01:33:41.616
What's up?

2127
01:33:41.702 --> 01:33:42.965
Look. I got...

2128
01:33:43.052 --> 01:33:44.662
I got good news
and I got bad news.

2129
01:33:44.749 --> 01:33:46.446
- Okay.
- Bad news is..

2130
01:33:46.532 --> 01:33:47.925
...you're gonna have to find a
new lead for your film.

2131
01:33:48.013 --> 01:33:49.058
Uh. excuse me?

2132
01:33:49.145 --> 01:33:50.059
The good news is...

2133
01:33:51.321 --> 01:33:52.714
Huck here is your star.

2134
01:33:54.454 --> 01:33:55.673
My name's Finley.

2135
01:33:57.457 --> 01:33:59.198
Now. that is a great name.

2136
01:33:59.285 --> 01:34:01.244
[Trevor]
Think that really is.

2137
01:34:01.331 --> 01:34:03.376
Well. you know. it was written
for a male.

2138
01:34:03.463 --> 01:34:05.552
- It-it's an action film.
- Right.

2139
01:34:05.639 --> 01:34:07.903
But I'm thinking right now

2140
01:34:07.990 --> 01:34:10.688
that it would be so much better
with a female.

2141
01:34:10.775 --> 01:34:12.385
Finley.

2142
01:34:12.472 --> 01:34:13.822
Geez.

2143
01:34:13.909 --> 01:34:15.954
- I'm making calls.
- Okay.

2144
01:34:18.434 --> 01:34:19.478
And. Miss Finley

2145
01:34:19.566 --> 01:34:22.004
if it was okay by you..

2146
01:34:22.091 --> 01:34:23.309
Hm..

2147
01:34:23.396 --> 01:34:25.572
I could hang back

2148
01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:27.662
look after your farm.

2149
01:34:27.749 --> 01:34:29.576
Keep them horses in shape.

2150
01:34:29.664 --> 01:34:31.969
You know. since my step-family

2151
01:34:32.057 --> 01:34:34.016
won't be living here anymore..

2152
01:34:35.757 --> 01:34:37.715
I will need someone
to look after Jon Ham.

2153
01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:41.414
Right. Hey. Kale?

2154
01:34:41.501 --> 01:34:43.764
Yeah. buddy. Yeah.

2155
01:34:43.852 --> 01:34:45.505
Listen. I won't be needing
a manager anymore

2156
01:34:45.592 --> 01:34:48.421
but if you're interested

2157
01:34:48.508 --> 01:34:51.163
I will need someone to shovel
Jon Ham's poop.

Alrighty then.

2161
01:34:58.170 --> 01:34:59.868
- I'm not picking up poop.
- No..

2162
01:34:59.955 --> 01:35:01.913
- You're picking up poop.
- I'm not picking up pig poop.
