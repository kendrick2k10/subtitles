3
00:00:14.318 --> 00:00:17.234
Hurry. please! Hurry! No!

4
00:00:17.365 --> 00:00:20.107
I swear to God. if you don't
start telling me the truth.

5
00:00:20.237 --> 00:00:22.152
you're gonna be--
- All right. all right.

6
00:00:22.283 --> 00:00:25.155
I will tell you the truth.
The truth is... that...

7
00:00:25.286 --> 00:00:28.463
the truth is that I just feel
like you haven't been paying

8
00:00:28.593 --> 00:00:30.465
enough attention to me.
- No. you're lying.

9
00:00:30.595 --> 00:00:32.728
- And I missed you. and I just--
- Lies! You're just lying.

10
00:00:32.858 --> 00:00:35.165
you're saying this.
You're twisting it!

11
00:00:35.296 --> 00:00:37.602
Just to placate me like
I'm some kind of idiot.

12
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:40.083
Do you understand?
I'm not going back to jail!

13
00:00:41.128 --> 00:00:43.260
- You need to be taught a lesson.
- No.

14
00:00:43.391 --> 00:00:46.176
- Yeah. oh yeah.
- No. Larry. please don't!

15
00:00:58.145 --> 00:01:00.451
Guys. I am so far in
front of you. like--

16
00:01:00.582 --> 00:01:01.844
Dan. she's right in front!

17
00:01:01.974 --> 00:01:04.107
- Ah-ha! Oh!
- Okay. okay.

18
00:01:04.238 --> 00:01:05.326
I am so passed you guys.

19
00:01:05.456 --> 00:01:06.936
Okay. Claud.
stop trying so hard.

20
00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.546
Well. why don't you
try to keep up?

21
00:01:08.677 --> 00:01:10.461
Like. she's gonna try hard.

22
00:01:10.592 --> 00:01:12.594
I can't believe you chose that
sword. Dan. It's the lamest one.

23
00:01:12.724 --> 00:01:13.899
I can't believe you're still
wearing that hoodie. Claudia.

24
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.031
What is this. day ten?

25
00:01:15.162 --> 00:01:16.467
You are correct.

26
00:01:16.598 --> 00:01:18.948
Um. are we not going
to class today. guys?

27
00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.342
Yeah! Yeah!

28
00:01:23.344 --> 00:01:25.302
Let me guess. you guys
had chips for breakfast.

29
00:01:25.433 --> 00:01:27.087
Yeah. I mean. it was
either that or ramen.

30
00:01:27.217 --> 00:01:28.740
Yeah. or the last teaspoon
of peanut butter.

31
00:01:28.871 --> 00:01:30.438
Talk about failure to launch.

32
00:01:30.568 --> 00:01:32.570
I mean. whose turn is it to go
into town to do groceries?

33
00:01:32.701 --> 00:01:35.704
- I don't know. I'm really busy.
- Right. right.

34
00:01:35.834 --> 00:01:38.228
Isabella. can you please tell
Talia that we're really busy

35
00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:41.231
doing our homework. I mean.
theoretical physics and math?

36
00:01:41.362 --> 00:01:43.668
- What were we thinking?
- Kinda love our classes.

37
00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.280
And by the way. Claud. my dad
can teach you how to do laundry.

38
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.500
Your dad. Your dad's
getting out today.

39
00:01:49.631 --> 00:01:52.068
Uh. correction.
he's out and he's on his way.

40
00:01:52.199 --> 00:01:53.896
- He'll be here like. any minute.
- What? Tal. that's amazing.

41
00:01:54.026 --> 00:01:54.679
I know!

42
00:02:02.774 --> 00:02:05.386
Honey boy!

43
00:02:05.516 --> 00:02:09.477
Honey girl. come here!
Come here! Oh!

44
00:02:09.607 --> 00:02:13.133
Aw. yeah. That's...
you're... geez.

45
00:02:13.263 --> 00:02:15.744
You're enormous.
You're enormous.

46
00:02:15.874 --> 00:02:19.095
Oh. God.

47
00:02:19.226 --> 00:02:22.403
- Hello.
- He's here.

48
00:02:22.533 --> 00:02:24.970
How ya doin'? Hello.

49
00:02:25.101 --> 00:02:26.668

50
00:02:26.798 --> 00:02:28.235
- Isabella. how are ya?
- Larry!

51
00:02:28.365 --> 00:02:29.366
Good to see you. Hey.

52
00:02:29.497 --> 00:02:31.151
You met on Skype
that one time.

53
00:02:31.281 --> 00:02:32.674
Thank you for looking
after Tal while I was--

54
00:02:32.804 --> 00:02:34.154
She's told me so
much about you.

55
00:02:34.284 --> 00:02:36.025
- Yeah. she did?
- And this is Dan and Santos.

56
00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:37.592
- Hi. how ya goin'?
- Hey.

57
00:02:37.722 --> 00:02:39.333
- Hey. good to see you.
- Oh. hey. Yeah.

58
00:02:39.463 --> 00:02:41.683
- How ya doin'? How's it goin'?
- Oh.

59
00:02:41.813 --> 00:02:44.512
Hey. Wait a minute. hold on
now. which one is which here?

60
00:02:44.642 --> 00:02:46.209
Same hairdresser.
Hi. I'm Claudia.

61
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.125
Hey. Okay. we'll do that.
Hi. Claudia.

62
00:02:49.256 --> 00:02:51.214
Well. we gotta work
on that shake. don't we?

63
00:02:51.345 --> 00:02:52.781
Dad. I hope you don't mind

64
00:02:52.911 --> 00:02:54.783
but I've been raving about you
to everyone.

65
00:02:54.913 --> 00:02:56.611
Oh. yeah?

66
00:02:56.741 --> 00:02:58.656
She's been telling us all
about how you singlehandedly

67
00:02:58.787 --> 00:03:00.092
nailed Bernie Kerik?

68
00:03:00.223 --> 00:03:02.356
Oh yeah. that was fun.

69
00:03:02.486 --> 00:03:04.532
The grand exalted Commissioner
of Police

70
00:03:04.662 --> 00:03:06.751
for the great City of New York.

71
00:03:06.882 --> 00:03:09.493
No one knew what a corrupt loser
he was

72
00:03:09.624 --> 00:03:13.715
until I clued in the FBI.
Had him thrown in jail.

73
00:03:13.845 --> 00:03:17.153
He was so close to becoming
Secretary of Homeland Security.

74
00:03:17.284 --> 00:03:19.024
Our national security would
have been in that liar's hands

75
00:03:19.155 --> 00:03:21.201
if it weren't for Dad.

76
00:03:21.331 --> 00:03:24.247
I mean. it says here that
Bernie Kerik stepped down

77
00:03:24.378 --> 00:03:26.423
from Secretary of Homeland
Security

78
00:03:26.554 --> 00:03:28.469
because he once hired
an undocumented nanny.

79
00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.558
I mean. that's not exactly
corruption.

80
00:03:30.688 --> 00:03:32.864
Claudia. are you
questioning my dad?

81
00:03:32.995 --> 00:03:34.692
Shh. no. no listen. she
has every right to question

82
00:03:34.823 --> 00:03:37.086
anything and anyone she wants.

83
00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:40.785
Fact of the matter is I was a
victim of conspiracy against me.

84
00:03:40.916 --> 00:03:43.919
I was unjustly accused of
defying a custody order.

85
00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.356
- I defied nothing.
- Nope.

86
00:03:46.487 --> 00:03:51.187
Tal's mother. my ex-wife.
genius of light that she is.

87
00:03:51.318 --> 00:03:53.145
wanted to keep her away from me.

88
00:03:53.276 --> 00:03:56.105
It's called parental
alienation. She's a monster.

89
00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:59.717
Yeah. So. she teams up with
none other than Bernie Kerik.

90
00:03:59.848 --> 00:04:01.937
And then they had
me put in prison.

91
00:04:02.067 --> 00:04:03.634
- Mm-hmm.
- Sorry. I was just asking.

92
00:04:03.765 --> 00:04:07.116
Listen. you ask.
Ask anything you want.

93
00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:10.772
I'm an open book here.
And you kids.

94
00:04:10.902 --> 00:04:12.730
if you've got anything
you wanna talk about.

95
00:04:12.861 --> 00:04:15.864
you can come to me.
Tal's friends are my friends.

96
00:04:18.214 --> 00:04:21.913
So. guess what? I'm gonna
cook you a steak dinner

97
00:04:22.044 --> 00:04:25.569
like you've never seen it. I'm
talking like three inches thick.

98
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.354
There's a butcher in Bronxville.

99
00:04:27.484 --> 00:04:28.833
Go ahead.

100
00:04:28.964 --> 00:04:30.444
Get anything you want.
all right?

101
00:04:30.574 --> 00:04:32.054
And you probably don't have
a car.

102
00:04:32.184 --> 00:04:34.056
I didn't let go of my driver.
You can take the limo and...

103
00:04:34.186 --> 00:04:36.232
- Limo?
- There's a limo?

104
00:04:36.363 --> 00:04:39.235
That. they're excited about.

105
00:04:39.366 --> 00:04:42.630
Thanks again for having me.
It's been an absolute pleasure.

106
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.197
And um. what's next
for you. sir?

107
00:04:45.328 --> 00:04:47.243
A shower.

108
00:04:47.374 --> 00:04:49.201
- I'll show you where it is.
- Thanks.

109
00:04:50.377 --> 00:04:53.858
And what I should've been doing
for the last two years

110
00:04:53.989 --> 00:04:57.427
and that's taking care of my
baby girl. Thanks a lot.

111
00:04:57.558 --> 00:04:59.211
- Thanks for dinner.
- No. thank you.

112
00:05:08.395 --> 00:05:10.222
And that's what I do.

113
00:05:10.353 --> 00:05:14.139
So. I was part of developing
Quest for Potential

114
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.707
with a philosopher buddy
of mine.

115
00:05:16.838 --> 00:05:18.840
I'm gonna demonstrate
it for you.

116
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.147
But first we're gonna maybe
check it out. right. Claudia?

117
00:05:22.278 --> 00:05:24.411
Make sure it's the real thing?

118
00:05:24.541 --> 00:05:30.330
So uh. Santos. you and I were
talking privately.

119
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.638
- May I share with everyone?
- Yeah. no... go for it.

120
00:05:34.769 --> 00:05:38.860
Okay. So. we were talking
about your father.

121
00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:44.431
What's his name?

122
00:05:45.823 --> 00:05:47.825
Uh... Santos. Senior.

123
00:05:47.956 --> 00:05:49.740
Seriously?

124
00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:51.263
Yes.

125
00:05:51.394 --> 00:05:53.396
Santos. how are you supposed
to self-define

126
00:05:53.527 --> 00:05:55.398
and self-realize if. if you
don't even have your own name?

127
00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:57.748
Geez.

128
00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:02.797
Okay. little Santos. what do
you feel about big Santos?

129
00:06:02.927 --> 00:06:08.324
Uh. I don't know.
He's tried his best. I suppose.

130
00:06:08.455 --> 00:06:12.415
Oh. my God what a bullshit
answer that is. Okay.

131
00:06:12.546 --> 00:06:16.158
Feel. How do you feel about him?

132
00:06:16.288 --> 00:06:19.683
So. was he uh. ugly?

133
00:06:19.814 --> 00:06:21.772
- No.
- Was he stinky?

134
00:06:21.903 --> 00:06:23.905
- No.
- Was he short? Was he fat?

135
00:06:24.035 --> 00:06:25.776
- Was he bald like me?
- No. No. it's--

136
00:06:25.907 --> 00:06:28.518
- Oh. what. what is it?
- No. it's me.

137
00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:30.085
- Okay.
- Me.

138
00:06:31.739 --> 00:06:34.611
Um. I'm the one who stinks.

139
00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:40.835
Uh. in high school I was kind
of a mess emotionally

140
00:06:40.965 --> 00:06:42.793
and I...

141
00:06:42.924 --> 00:06:46.449
I blame my parents for it.
For my mental health stuff.

142
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:51.585
Yeah. That was bad.
and this is good.

143
00:06:51.715 --> 00:06:56.154
But it's not good enough. But I
think there's more here. right?

144
00:06:56.285 --> 00:06:57.634
There's more he's not telling
us. that he's not.

145
00:06:57.765 --> 00:06:59.331
you're not connecting.
- Uh--

146
00:06:59.462 --> 00:07:01.812
- Entirely with--
- No. I think I just said it.

147
00:07:01.943 --> 00:07:03.423
I don't know.
I don't think so.

148
00:07:03.553 --> 00:07:05.120
I think you're holding back
because like. you said it.

149
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.820
right. which is a very rational
reaction and mind thought it

150
00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:11.648
and your mouth spoke it but you
didn't...

151
00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:14.042
may I?
- Yeah.

152
00:07:14.172 --> 00:07:17.349
There's more you're hiding
in here. You're blocked here.

153
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.439
What do you got from here? What
are you holding back right here?

154
00:07:19.569 --> 00:07:21.136
What are you holding back.
Santos?

155
00:07:21.266 --> 00:07:24.139
My parents sacrificed
everything.

156
00:07:24.269 --> 00:07:26.228
They lived through stuff
you can't imagine

157
00:07:26.358 --> 00:07:27.882
coming to this country and...

158
00:07:29.187 --> 00:07:32.930
When things got a little tough
for me. What did I do?

159
00:07:33.931 --> 00:07:35.629
I tried to kill myself.

160
00:07:37.239 --> 00:07:41.156
I didn't fight the way
my dad did. His whole life.

161
00:07:42.984 --> 00:07:45.073
I just ran away.

162
00:07:46.117 --> 00:07:50.034
And... I'm afraid...

163
00:07:50.165 --> 00:07:52.472
and I'm afraid this is how
I'm always gonna be.

164
00:07:53.516 --> 00:07:55.997
A coward. pathetic and...

165
00:08:02.786 --> 00:08:06.268
It's all right.
That's a good boy.

166
00:08:06.398 --> 00:08:09.227
That's a good boy right there.

167
00:08:09.358 --> 00:08:12.013
Right. that's Q4P working.

168
00:08:16.757 --> 00:08:20.282
I can help all you kids
with this.

169
00:08:20.412 --> 00:08:23.546
You're all thrust into
this world

170
00:08:25.113 --> 00:08:27.376
with all this baggage and
there's no guidance to help you

171
00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:29.857
learn how to become adults.
That's... it's...

172
00:08:32.076 --> 00:08:35.427
Well. take advantage
of me while I'm here.

173
00:08:35.558 --> 00:08:37.386
I'll be happy to help any way
I can.

174
00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:40.084
Are you staying much longer?

175
00:08:40.215 --> 00:08:42.783
Uh...

176
00:08:42.913 --> 00:08:46.003
I'll be moving into
the city pretty soon.

177
00:08:46.134 --> 00:08:50.965
All right. reveille. 0600.
that's 6 a.m. to you civilians.

178
00:08:51.095 --> 00:08:53.141
Oh. come here. Oh.

179
00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:54.969
- Good night. Dad.
- Good night. baby.

180
00:08:56.666 --> 00:08:59.843
Hey. uh Larry. I uh. I wanted
to take you up on the offer.

181
00:08:59.974 --> 00:09:01.279
you know. to talk.

182
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:03.543
- Yeah. sure. anytime Dan.
- Yeah. okay. yeah.

183
00:09:03.673 --> 00:09:05.762
- All right. have a seat.
- Yeah. sounds good.

184
00:09:05.893 --> 00:09:07.329
Um. I'm just gonna
tidy my room up a bit.

185
00:09:07.459 --> 00:09:08.939
- All right. You got it.
- Thank you.

186
00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:10.637
Perfect.

187
00:09:35.879 --> 00:09:37.446
Izzy?

188
00:09:45.889 --> 00:09:49.676
Hey. Can I come in?

189
00:09:51.112 --> 00:09:52.766
You all right?

190
00:10:09.173 --> 00:10:12.176
You are making a
pretty big assumption right now.

191
00:10:12.307 --> 00:10:14.570
No. I just...

192
00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.139
Spit it out. You wanna
say something. say it.

193
00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:22.317
Nothing.
I'm half asleep over here.

194
00:10:25.146 --> 00:10:28.018
You're not a very good liar.

195
00:10:28.149 --> 00:10:30.934
Hmm. Why. are you an expert?

196
00:10:33.502 --> 00:10:36.636
- Oh. morning honey boy.
- Morning. honey girl.

197
00:10:41.379 --> 00:10:44.252
Mr. Gilman. it's bizarre
and disturbing.

198
00:10:44.382 --> 00:10:47.690
Mm-hmm. And you're saying
he's one of the students' dads?

199
00:10:47.821 --> 00:10:51.128
Yes. he's the father of Talia
Ray. And he's an ex-con.

200
00:10:51.259 --> 00:10:53.130
Did I forget to mention that?

201
00:10:53.261 --> 00:10:56.525
So. not only is he sleeping on
the couch in my daughter's dorm.

202
00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:58.658
he's also spending nights in
one of the girls' bedrooms.

203
00:10:58.788 --> 00:11:00.660
- What's her name again?
- Isabella.

204
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:02.574
And Isabella's really sensitive.

205
00:11:02.705 --> 00:11:05.012
so I just really worry
about her.

206
00:11:05.142 --> 00:11:08.798
Yeah. Claudia. have you seen

207
00:11:08.929 --> 00:11:11.235
or heard anything that makes
you think your dorm mate

208
00:11:11.366 --> 00:11:13.455
is being abused?

209
00:11:13.585 --> 00:11:14.848
Have you?

210
00:11:16.197 --> 00:11:18.025
I'm not a hundred percent.

211
00:11:18.155 --> 00:11:20.941
Well. I will certainly send
this up the email chain

212
00:11:21.071 --> 00:11:22.682
with a big red flag.

213
00:11:22.812 --> 00:11:25.859
But you will block him
from campus. right?

214
00:11:25.989 --> 00:11:31.473
Uh... I do appreciate your
very natural concern

215
00:11:31.603 --> 00:11:34.171
but parents are allowed to visit
their kids on campus

216
00:11:34.302 --> 00:11:36.870
and the students are
legally the age of consent.

217
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.569
So. unless there's a criminal
complaint. my hands are tied.

218
00:11:42.963 --> 00:11:44.878
Well. I hope you're locking
your door at night

219
00:11:45.008 --> 00:11:46.836
so he doesn't try anything funny
with you.

220
00:11:46.967 --> 00:11:49.143
Yeah. but it's not me
I'm worried about. Mom.

221
00:11:49.273 --> 00:11:50.884
Ah. okay. Well.
let's go have some lunch.

222
00:11:51.014 --> 00:11:52.842
You wanna go to the pub.
the cafeteria. Bronxville?

223
00:11:52.973 --> 00:11:55.236
- Show me your haunts.
- Mom. I told you on the phone.

224
00:11:55.366 --> 00:11:58.108
I've got a class.
And I can't miss it.

225
00:11:58.239 --> 00:11:59.849
I thought you could play
hooky with your mom.

226
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.634
I know. but the prof
is giving us a test. so.

227
00:12:02.765 --> 00:12:04.985
All right. well let me
walk you to class anyway.

228
00:12:07.161 --> 00:12:09.859
Hey.
What's going on with you?

229
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:11.905
Is there something else
you wanna tell me about. love?

230
00:12:13.602 --> 00:12:15.343
It's just this weirdness
with Larry.

231
00:12:15.473 --> 00:12:18.041
I mean. it's like he's the life
of the party.

232
00:12:18.172 --> 00:12:21.305
Everybody loves him. And I don't
know how I can avoid him

233
00:12:21.436 --> 00:12:23.655
without losing all my friends.

234
00:12:23.786 --> 00:12:26.571
I felt like I was finally
finding my people.

235
00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:31.054
You are an amazing
young woman

236
00:12:31.185 --> 00:12:33.622
at one of the best colleges
in the United States. okay?

237
00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:36.277
So. stay positive
and go ace that test.

238
00:12:36.407 --> 00:12:37.365
Okay.

239
00:12:45.939 --> 00:12:48.028
Right now.
from this position.

240
00:12:48.158 --> 00:12:50.291
- I can take 'em to the left.
- Yeah.

241
00:12:50.421 --> 00:12:52.249
I can take 'em
to the right.

242
00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.511
- I can take 'em to the movies.
- Yeah!

243
00:12:56.253 --> 00:12:57.864
- Or I can take him down.
- Take him down!

244
00:12:57.994 --> 00:12:59.517
Take him down!

245
00:12:59.648 --> 00:13:01.302
Take him down!

246
00:13:01.432 --> 00:13:03.304
- Claudia. come!
- Larry's teaching us

247
00:13:03.434 --> 00:13:05.001
how to take down a bigger man
than us.

248
00:13:05.132 --> 00:13:07.221
There is no bigger
man than you. Santos.

249
00:13:07.351 --> 00:13:09.310
Show her the one that
you showed me and Tal.

250
00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.616
- Yeah. Yeah. yeah. yeah.
- Okay. yeah. okay.

251
00:13:11.747 --> 00:13:14.358
We used this in the Marines.
It's based on hapkido.

252
00:13:14.489 --> 00:13:16.926
So. uh. if a man puts
his hands on you.

253
00:13:17.057 --> 00:13:18.493
what you do is you grab him
with that hand.

254
00:13:18.623 --> 00:13:20.364
and grab around the thumb.
And now.

255
00:13:20.495 --> 00:13:22.453
when you twist there's
nothing he can do.

256
00:13:22.584 --> 00:13:23.672
She can take me down.

257
00:13:25.935 --> 00:13:27.937
One down! Finish him!

258
00:13:29.069 --> 00:13:30.766
You call me fat?

259
00:13:36.859 --> 00:13:39.601
- Claud!
- What?

260
00:13:39.731 --> 00:13:43.344
That was good though. That was
really good. Good job. good job.

261
00:13:43.474 --> 00:13:45.520
- Keep practicing.
- Okay. okay. now.

262
00:13:49.393 --> 00:13:54.094
All right. you win.
Claudia. why do you hate me?

263
00:13:54.224 --> 00:13:56.183
Oh. I don't hate you.

264
00:13:57.532 --> 00:14:00.840
I've extracted intel out
of terrorists. kid. okay?

265
00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:03.407
I know when I'm being lied to.

266
00:14:04.408 --> 00:14:07.107
It's just. it's strange
and disturbing

267
00:14:07.237 --> 00:14:10.588
for a 50-year-old man
to be spending all night

268
00:14:10.719 --> 00:14:15.028
in his daughter's best friend's
room. It's... I...

269
00:14:15.158 --> 00:14:18.205
It's what. perverted?
It's gross? Is that it?

270
00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:22.383
Okay. first of all.
I sleep on Izzy's floor.

271
00:14:23.906 --> 00:14:25.560
And second she...

272
00:14:27.257 --> 00:14:31.261
Izzy shared with me some pretty
devastating details

273
00:14:31.392 --> 00:14:34.482
about sexual abuse she suffered
in early childhood.

274
00:14:34.612 --> 00:14:36.658
So. I figured she needed
the attachment parenting

275
00:14:36.788 --> 00:14:38.747
that she never got growing up.

276
00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:41.576
- Oh. that's terrible. I--
- Right?

277
00:14:41.706 --> 00:14:43.273
- I didn't know.
- Yeah.

278
00:14:43.404 --> 00:14:45.275
So. let's not let
anyone know. okay?

279
00:14:45.406 --> 00:14:47.669
Let's just keep this
between you and me. Please?

280
00:14:47.799 --> 00:14:49.758
- Of course.
- Yeah.

281
00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:54.284
So. could we just bury the
hatchet. you and me? We good?

282
00:14:54.415 --> 00:14:55.416
Yeah.

283
00:14:57.809 --> 00:15:00.073
Look at that.
Like butta.

284
00:15:00.203 --> 00:15:03.598
Look at that heartstopper.

285
00:15:07.819 --> 00:15:09.473
What is it?

286
00:15:09.604 --> 00:15:11.606
Yeah. you're like. anxious
all the time.

287
00:15:11.736 --> 00:15:13.390
Even now. What's goin' on?

288
00:15:13.521 --> 00:15:16.393
It's like you're carrying this
heavy secret around with ya.

289
00:15:18.178 --> 00:15:20.267
I guess I just worry a lot.

290
00:15:20.397 --> 00:15:22.573
You know. I don't feel
very confident.

291
00:15:22.704 --> 00:15:24.488
you know. as an adult.

292
00:15:24.619 --> 00:15:27.361
No. I think... I think it's
something else.

293
00:15:27.491 --> 00:15:29.711
I think... you wanna know
how I know?

294
00:15:29.841 --> 00:15:33.019
'Cause you. you've been
blocking me. Mentally.

295
00:15:33.149 --> 00:15:34.803
And you're not eatin'.

296
00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.981
Yeah. you know.
I think I changed my mind.

297
00:15:39.112 --> 00:15:40.983
I can get it to go.
I'll take it home.

298
00:15:41.114 --> 00:15:43.290
I'll share it with everybody.
It could feed us for a week.

299
00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:46.293
Come on.
Thank you for treating me.

300
00:15:46.423 --> 00:15:48.338
What are you talking?
Do me a favor.

301
00:15:48.469 --> 00:15:50.688
pick up your knife and fork.

302
00:15:50.819 --> 00:15:52.734
I really don't know.

303
00:15:52.864 --> 00:15:54.344
Well. just one bite.
Just grab your fork.

304
00:15:54.475 --> 00:15:56.433
grab your knife.
Do what normal people do.

305
00:15:56.564 --> 00:15:58.044
Put that thing in your mouth.

306
00:16:00.176 --> 00:16:03.092
Do it. Just do it.
Just do it. Just chew.

307
00:16:03.223 --> 00:16:06.966
And there it is. and the
shoulders drop. Am I wrong?

308
00:16:07.096 --> 00:16:08.968
I wanna get back to what we were
talking about.

309
00:16:09.098 --> 00:16:10.970
these crappy feelings
you were having.

310
00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.842
Stems from early childhood
trauma. I can guarantee it.

311
00:16:15.583 --> 00:16:17.498
I mean. I don't remember
anything too traumatic.

312
00:16:17.628 --> 00:16:19.891
Yeah. all right that is uh.

313
00:16:20.022 --> 00:16:24.070
that is classic suppressed
memory syndrome. CSMS.

314
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:29.249
In order to confront it
you gotta really dig down.

315
00:16:31.294 --> 00:16:33.383
Tell me what comes up.

316
00:16:33.514 --> 00:16:35.429
- Just come on. Tell me.
- I've... I don't know.

317
00:16:35.559 --> 00:16:36.952
- You do know. just dig deep.
- No.

318
00:16:37.083 --> 00:16:38.693
Trust me on this.
This is. come on.

319
00:16:38.823 --> 00:16:41.000
this is the meat right here
we're goin' for. all right?

320
00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.610
Chew. chew. chew.
and now spit it out.

321
00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.177
My dead sister.

322
00:16:44.307 --> 00:16:47.093
Okay. okay. But first thing.
my condolences.

323
00:16:47.223 --> 00:16:49.573
I'm sorry to hear about that.
but what about her?

324
00:16:49.704 --> 00:16:51.184
- Um...
- Spit it out.

325
00:16:51.314 --> 00:16:53.751
- Spit out the rest. Come on.
- My parents had a baby.

326
00:16:53.882 --> 00:16:55.927
- Okay.
- And she died.

327
00:16:56.058 --> 00:17:00.715
She was a stillborn. And when
I came along years later.

328
00:17:00.845 --> 00:17:05.372
I... I was never her.
You know? I...

329
00:17:07.765 --> 00:17:10.594
It's like they transferred
their heartbreak on to me.

330
00:17:10.725 --> 00:17:14.381
Like. they'd never see me.
They'd just see her.

331
00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:23.825
But they never gave you the
attention you deserved. Right?

332
00:17:25.218 --> 00:17:28.569
See? I think you just had
a breakthrough.

333
00:17:32.312 --> 00:17:33.617
I'm proud of ya.

334
00:17:33.748 --> 00:17:35.880
- You know what we should do?
- Hmm.

335
00:17:36.011 --> 00:17:39.362
You should come and stay with
Tal and me in the city.

336
00:17:39.493 --> 00:17:42.931
We've got an apartment in the
Upper East Side for the summer.

337
00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:46.543
Your friends are coming.
They're coming up there.

338
00:17:46.674 --> 00:17:48.284
They're staying there rent free.

339
00:17:48.415 --> 00:17:50.982
We're gonna keep workin' on all
the great work that we're doing.

340
00:17:51.113 --> 00:17:53.681
You could work on this. I mean.
we just. you know.

341
00:17:53.811 --> 00:17:55.335
tip of the iceberg here.
but we're not done.

342
00:17:55.465 --> 00:17:56.901
But I'm tellin' you.

343
00:17:57.032 --> 00:18:01.776
I can't. Larry. thank you.
but...

344
00:18:01.906 --> 00:18:04.518
I think I need to go home and
work this out with my parents.

345
00:18:04.648 --> 00:18:06.433
I mean. I owe them that.

346
00:18:06.563 --> 00:18:11.002
Well. I think that they will
gaslight you.

347
00:18:11.133 --> 00:18:16.007
I think you will tell them
the truth

348
00:18:16.138 --> 00:18:18.793
and they will say you are
overreacting.

349
00:18:19.924 --> 00:18:22.362
As you said. they live nearby.
right? Close.

350
00:18:26.279 --> 00:18:27.802
I'm just sayin'.

351
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.502
So. are you dating someone?

352
00:18:32.633 --> 00:18:35.201
- Oh.
- Why would you ask that?

353
00:18:35.331 --> 00:18:37.638
I don't know. you've just
been. you know. MIA

354
00:18:37.768 --> 00:18:39.683
and we haven't seen you
in a while.

355
00:18:39.814 --> 00:18:41.424
- Yeah. well--
- I thought maybe...

356
00:18:41.555 --> 00:18:44.688
I've been really busy
with exams. And um. you know.

357
00:18:44.819 --> 00:18:47.169
actually I've been in therapy.

358
00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.519
Therapy? Wow.

359
00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:51.086
Well. you haven't been asking
for any extra allowance

360
00:18:51.217 --> 00:18:53.784
or anything.
- I haven't been paying for it.

361
00:18:53.915 --> 00:18:55.743
- Oh.
- How does that work?

362
00:18:55.873 --> 00:18:57.875
Is some psych student messing
with your head?

363
00:18:59.703 --> 00:19:01.575
Uh. actually.
Larry's been helping me.

364
00:19:01.705 --> 00:19:03.142
Larry?

365
00:19:03.272 --> 00:19:05.709
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Larry Ray?

366
00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.624
Is he still living
with you kids at the dorm?

367
00:19:07.755 --> 00:19:12.281
Yeah. he um... you know.
he cooks us healthy dinners.

368
00:19:12.412 --> 00:19:14.457
- He teaches us to be responsible.
- Wait. wait. wait. wait.

369
00:19:14.588 --> 00:19:16.111
What's going on with Isabella?

370
00:19:16.242 --> 00:19:18.287
Oh. well it turns out
with Isabella

371
00:19:18.418 --> 00:19:20.681
that we'd actually completely
misread it. Mom.

372
00:19:20.811 --> 00:19:23.118
And he was actually helping her
through a really tough time.

373
00:19:23.249 --> 00:19:26.382
And he's been helping me.
you know.

374
00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:30.299
I've been remembering
a lot of traumatic things

375
00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:33.302
from my childhood and things
that are really hard for me

376
00:19:33.433 --> 00:19:34.738
to talk to you about.

377
00:19:35.652 --> 00:19:38.394
Okay. sweetie.
this man's a criminal.

378
00:19:38.525 --> 00:19:40.048
He's my best friend. Dad.

379
00:19:41.528 --> 00:19:44.095
If you feel that your
childhood

380
00:19:44.226 --> 00:19:46.315
was anything close
to traumatic.

381
00:19:46.446 --> 00:19:48.883
I would say that's a bit
of an overreaction.

382
00:19:49.927 --> 00:19:51.494
Wouldn't you?

383
00:19:54.323 --> 00:19:57.065
You know what? I'll just um...

384
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:10.818
You were right about
my parents. I tried--

385
00:20:10.948 --> 00:20:12.950
Come on. Come on.
forget about them.

386
00:20:13.081 --> 00:20:16.563
We're here for you.
We love ya. Trauma and all.

387
00:20:16.693 --> 00:20:18.478
All right. who owes me
five bucks?

388
00:20:22.699 --> 00:20:26.225
It's 0600.
I wanna see some crunches!

389
00:20:26.355 --> 00:20:29.228
Come on. good mornin'!
Top o' the mornin' to ya!

390
00:20:29.358 --> 00:20:31.273
You don't build
your core strength.

391
00:20:31.404 --> 00:20:33.536
you are not gonna be
battle ready.

392
00:20:33.667 --> 00:20:36.278
All right. I wanna see 200.
Who's gonna give me 200?

393
00:20:36.409 --> 00:20:38.149
- We will!
- Come on. you wusses.

394
00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.674
- I can't hear ya. Who's gonna?
- We will!

395
00:20:40.804 --> 00:20:42.632
- Who's gonna give me more?
- We will!

396
00:20:42.763 --> 00:20:46.157
- Who wants to grow the hell up?
- We do!

397
00:20:46.288 --> 00:20:47.942
Have I called you wusses
already this morning?

398
00:20:48.072 --> 00:20:49.422
Yes.

399
00:20:52.294 --> 00:20:54.949
All right. hold. hold on a
minute. Break it down.

400
00:20:57.691 --> 00:20:59.040
Dan. what's wrong?

401
00:20:59.693 --> 00:21:01.782
Um...

402
00:21:03.044 --> 00:21:05.133
Nothing.
No. I'm sorry.

403
00:21:06.134 --> 00:21:10.791
Well. looks like Dan

404
00:21:10.921 --> 00:21:14.577
is having a bit of a
personal issue. huh?

405
00:21:18.277 --> 00:21:23.543
Tal. Iz. and uh. Claud.
give Dan a hug.

406
00:21:23.673 --> 00:21:26.894
Oh. come here. It's okay.

407
00:21:27.024 --> 00:21:29.070
Does it feel disgusting
hugging Dan?

408
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.593
- No.
- No.

409
00:21:30.724 --> 00:21:32.378
No? You sure?
'Cause he's kinda sweaty there.

410
00:21:32.508 --> 00:21:35.555
I'm just wondering.

411
00:21:35.685 --> 00:21:38.384
Nice. Dan. how's it feel
having all those ladies

412
00:21:38.514 --> 00:21:40.429
pressing up against your body
like that?

413
00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:43.954
Um. it feels nice. I guess.

414
00:21:44.085 --> 00:21:46.870
Yeah? You gettin'... you
gettin' aroused there. big guy?

415
00:21:47.001 --> 00:21:49.133
It's a possibility.

416
00:21:49.264 --> 00:21:51.527
Well. there ya go.

417
00:21:51.658 --> 00:21:52.963
And you said you were having
trouble with uh...

418
00:21:53.094 --> 00:21:55.096
your sexual orientation.

419
00:21:56.750 --> 00:22:00.057
Never use tears to get outta
my exercise regimen. son.

420
00:22:00.188 --> 00:22:05.106
Claudia. I think you should
have sex with Dan.

421
00:22:06.107 --> 00:22:08.544
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. I'm serious.

422
00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:15.334
What did you said? You said you
thought you were unattractive?

423
00:22:15.464 --> 00:22:17.510
Right? What was that.
what was that...

424
00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.294
you said you
were feeling insecure.

425
00:22:19.425 --> 00:22:21.949
but there was a word you used
to get out. to... be called...

426
00:22:22.079 --> 00:22:24.168
Oompa Loompa.

427
00:22:24.299 --> 00:22:25.735
Remember?

428
00:22:25.866 --> 00:22:28.738
Well. how else do you think

429
00:22:28.869 --> 00:22:30.349
you're gonna get over
your insecurities?

430
00:22:31.219 --> 00:22:33.352
You know. loosen up?

431
00:22:33.482 --> 00:22:37.660
Sex is liberating. It's freeing.

432
00:22:49.324 --> 00:22:52.066
What? Get outta your heads.
get into your bodies.

433
00:23:26.622 --> 00:23:29.408
Hi. I'm Claudia.

434
00:23:29.538 --> 00:23:33.542
Hey. I'm uh. Santos' sister.
Felicia.

435
00:23:33.673 --> 00:23:35.979
Larry invited me to
come stay for a while.

436
00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:37.851
Does Santos know you're here?

437
00:23:37.981 --> 00:23:41.158
Yeah. He introduced Larry
to me a while ago

438
00:23:41.289 --> 00:23:42.638
and we've been dating.

439
00:23:42.769 --> 00:23:44.031
Oh. wow.

440
00:23:44.161 --> 00:23:46.163
Online and on
the phone. but yeah.

441
00:23:46.294 --> 00:23:49.036
Buenas dias. hermanita.

442
00:23:49.166 --> 00:23:51.908
I used to be his go-to when
he was feeling upset.

443
00:23:52.039 --> 00:23:54.911
Remember that. bonito? Hmm? I'd
have to talk you off the ledge.

444
00:23:55.042 --> 00:23:57.914
Well. I take full credit
for my superstar hermanita

445
00:23:58.045 --> 00:23:59.525
for her PhD in psychiatry.

446
00:24:02.005 --> 00:24:04.094
You guys are so cute.

447
00:24:04.225 --> 00:24:08.838
Anyway. I'm so grateful he's
getting help from Larry now.

448
00:24:08.969 --> 00:24:11.058
Are you gonna be staying
here for long or?

449
00:24:11.188 --> 00:24:15.715
Yeah. Uh. I don't feel
safe in L.A.

450
00:24:15.845 --> 00:24:17.368
I'm putting my career
on hold for a while.

451
00:24:17.499 --> 00:24:19.066
Oh. really?

452
00:24:19.196 --> 00:24:22.286
I started getting followed
recently in L.A.

453
00:24:22.417 --> 00:24:23.810
Spied on.

454
00:24:24.811 --> 00:24:26.508
When I was...

455
00:24:26.639 --> 00:24:29.642
I mean. anyone in Larry's orbit
is at risk of being targeted.

456
00:24:29.772 --> 00:24:31.078
I started receiving
death threats.

457
00:24:31.208 --> 00:24:34.429
Wow. Oh. are you serious?
You gotta be kidding.

458
00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:38.085
No. Paranoia's through
the roof.

459
00:24:38.215 --> 00:24:41.784
Can't focus at work.
I can't... I can't sleep.

460
00:24:41.915 --> 00:24:45.440
Well. who would it be? Do you
think it would be Bernie Kerik

461
00:24:45.571 --> 00:24:47.398
or Larry's ex-wife who would be
targeting?

462
00:24:47.529 --> 00:24:48.965
I don't know.

463
00:24:49.096 --> 00:24:53.100
But Larry is the only person
who can protect us.

464
00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:57.365
My ears are burning. You met
my future wife. Felicia.

465
00:24:57.496 --> 00:25:00.542
- Hi. bunny.
- Oh. I missed that curly hair.

466
00:25:00.673 --> 00:25:03.632
Look at that. I gotta borrow
some of that. Oh. my God.

467
00:25:03.763 --> 00:25:06.026
So. I guess we better make
room for Izzy out here. huh?

468
00:25:06.156 --> 00:25:08.028
Nah. Izzy's fine where she is.

469
00:25:08.898 --> 00:25:10.857
But there's only
one bed in there.

470
00:25:10.987 --> 00:25:12.815
We'll all share the bed.

471
00:25:12.946 --> 00:25:15.470
Until Isabella's feeling ready
to detach from Lar.

472
00:25:15.601 --> 00:25:17.733
I'm not going to get in the way
of her healing.

473
00:25:17.864 --> 00:25:19.256
I told ya.
she has a dirty mind.

474
00:25:19.387 --> 00:25:20.997
No. I don't.

475
00:25:21.128 --> 00:25:22.782
I'm working on it.

476
00:25:30.703 --> 00:25:34.097
Zhang. the man! You're here
for the rent. I assume?

477
00:25:34.228 --> 00:25:36.186
Pink.

478
00:25:36.317 --> 00:25:40.277
Yep. and all on my dime.
You'll love it when I'm done.

479
00:25:40.408 --> 00:25:41.975
You're two months behind.
Larry.

480
00:25:42.105 --> 00:25:43.585
Why are you putting
money into this?

481
00:25:43.716 --> 00:25:45.674
All right. don't get your
knickers in a knot. Geez.

482
00:25:48.503 --> 00:25:50.549
You're gonna get your money.

483
00:25:52.812 --> 00:25:54.901
All right. now there's $1.000
of it. And the rest--

484
00:25:55.031 --> 00:25:56.511
Morning.
Just getting started. Lar.

485
00:25:56.642 --> 00:25:58.469
Morning. that's...

486
00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.168
- You're short.
- You're short. okay?

487
00:26:01.298 --> 00:26:02.952
Now. listen. I got some stuff
I gotta move around.

488
00:26:03.083 --> 00:26:04.650
I'm gonna switch some accounts

489
00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:06.739
and you'll get it as soon
as we can.

490
00:26:06.869 --> 00:26:08.784
- You got something on your back.
- Tomorrow. Larry.

491
00:26:08.915 --> 00:26:10.656
I'll be here at seven p.m.
sharp. Got it?

492
00:26:10.786 --> 00:26:14.573
Yeah. I got it. Your words
were spoken. Heard 'em.

493
00:26:21.971 --> 00:26:23.582
- Morning.
- Morning.

494
00:26:25.975 --> 00:26:27.542
What the hell is this?

495
00:26:27.673 --> 00:26:28.978
- Uh--
- What is that?

496
00:26:29.109 --> 00:26:30.327
- I. I. I'm sorry.
- Get down here.

497
00:26:30.458 --> 00:26:32.460
- That was just an accident.
- Get down.

498
00:26:32.591 --> 00:26:34.680
There is no such thing
as accidents.

499
00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:36.203
- How many times I gotta tell ya?
- I know.

500
00:26:36.333 --> 00:26:38.379
What I gotta do to get
that into your head?

501
00:26:38.509 --> 00:26:40.555
Felicia. see what's happening
with your brother here?

502
00:26:40.686 --> 00:26:43.340
He's doing it again. I
don't even know where to start!

503
00:26:43.471 --> 00:26:46.517
- Okay. explain?
- He sabotages everything!

504
00:26:46.648 --> 00:26:49.564
My belongings and my apartment.
How? Tell her how.

505
00:26:49.695 --> 00:26:51.218
I'll tell her how.

506
00:26:51.348 --> 00:26:54.090
By spilling paint in my hallway!
Right there.

507
00:26:54.221 --> 00:26:56.789
Can you...

508
00:26:56.919 --> 00:27:00.923
Do I have permission to deal
with him in a Q4P kinda way?

509
00:27:01.054 --> 00:27:03.273
- Of course. Larry. I trust you.
- Okay. fine.

510
00:27:03.404 --> 00:27:06.537
Instead of jumping out the
window and killin' himself.

511
00:27:06.668 --> 00:27:08.757
robbin' us all of his
precious life.

512
00:27:08.888 --> 00:27:11.194
Santos is just gonna sabotage
stuff. okay?

513
00:27:11.325 --> 00:27:13.719
You all in agreement with that?
He's gonna sabotage your things.

514
00:27:13.849 --> 00:27:16.199
That's what you're gonna do.
isn't it? Isn't it?

515
00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:17.548
Right. that's right.

516
00:27:17.679 --> 00:27:18.985
I. I'm sorry. I'm. I'm--

517
00:27:19.115 --> 00:27:21.901
You're flinchin'. Right?

518
00:27:23.293 --> 00:27:25.165
But you still haven't learned
how not to flinch.

519
00:27:25.295 --> 00:27:26.601
Okay. so we're gonna do this.
right?

520
00:27:26.732 --> 00:27:27.994
- Okay.
- We're gonna do this.

521
00:27:28.124 --> 00:27:29.560
- Yeah.
- Okay. look me in the eye.

522
00:27:29.691 --> 00:27:31.171
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

523
00:27:31.301 --> 00:27:33.608
Why did you spill...

524
00:27:33.739 --> 00:27:35.784
He's flinchin'. Why'd you spill
that expensive paint?

525
00:27:35.915 --> 00:27:39.005
Uh. I think this time it was
truly just an accident. Larry.

526
00:27:39.135 --> 00:27:40.963
No such things...

527
00:27:41.094 --> 00:27:43.444
...as accidents! Come on. man!

528
00:27:43.574 --> 00:27:46.055
Listen. it's just unresolved
trauma. kid.

529
00:27:46.186 --> 00:27:47.840
- Yeah.
- You understand?

530
00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:50.103
- Mm-hmm.
- Which manifests itself into...

531
00:27:50.233 --> 00:27:52.627
into certain behaviors.
So. my question to you is.

532
00:27:52.758 --> 00:27:54.803
what is your behavior. Santos?

533
00:27:54.934 --> 00:27:56.936
Uh. I have destructive
behavior

534
00:27:57.066 --> 00:27:59.982
because I blame everyone else
for me being a coward.

535
00:28:00.113 --> 00:28:02.681
My parents and my upbringing.
most of all.

536
00:28:02.811 --> 00:28:05.379
And I don't have the guts
to take accountability for--

537
00:28:05.509 --> 00:28:06.859
- Here it is.
- ...for my own actions.

538
00:28:06.989 --> 00:28:08.469
- Yes. my man! All right!
- Yeah.

539
00:28:08.599 --> 00:28:10.123
God damn. that's right!
You gettin' this?

540
00:28:10.253 --> 00:28:12.821
- This is gold.
- Yes.

541
00:28:12.952 --> 00:28:15.084
Is that not right there.
Felicia? Is that right?

542
00:28:15.215 --> 00:28:16.216
- Is that accurate?
- Yeah.

543
00:28:16.346 --> 00:28:17.565
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

544
00:28:17.696 --> 00:28:19.698
This is my home.
which is your home.

545
00:28:19.828 --> 00:28:22.178
- Thank you.
- Why? 'Cause you are surrounded

546
00:28:22.309 --> 00:28:24.354
with people who love you.
- I know.

547
00:28:24.485 --> 00:28:27.880
I proud of ya. Relax.
All right.

548
00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:30.578
So. what Santos is gonna do
right now

549
00:28:30.709 --> 00:28:32.754
is he's gonna make a list.
He's gonna email me a list

550
00:28:32.885 --> 00:28:36.149
of all the things that he's
broken. that he's ruined.

551
00:28:36.279 --> 00:28:38.934
so I have a record
to know exactly

552
00:28:39.065 --> 00:28:41.110
what his repairs need to be.

553
00:28:41.241 --> 00:28:43.460
Got it. yeah. you're
addressing the intentional

554
00:28:43.591 --> 00:28:45.288
manifestation
of childhood trauma.

555
00:28:45.419 --> 00:28:47.900
Oh. my God. she's good.
We got a doctor in the house.

556
00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:50.119
I tell ya.
Who wants waffles?

557
00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:52.905
I do! And thank you so much

558
00:28:53.035 --> 00:28:55.124
for pushing me even further.
Larry.

559
00:28:55.255 --> 00:28:58.084
No. listen. I got you. kid.
I got ya.

560
00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:00.956
- That's it.
- Look at that.

561
00:29:01.087 --> 00:29:02.915
that's a professional operation
right there.

562
00:29:03.524 --> 00:29:05.482
Anytime. Larry.

563
00:29:05.613 --> 00:29:07.354
Well. thank you. Joe.

564
00:29:10.052 --> 00:29:12.272
And thank you for uh.
for the deal you gave me

565
00:29:12.402 --> 00:29:14.143
on the sander there.

566
00:29:14.274 --> 00:29:16.450
You can pay my boss with
a credit card. Good?

567
00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:18.669
Credit card?
Yeah. I've heard of 'em.

568
00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.193
Bet they heard of you.

569
00:29:23.544 --> 00:29:25.459
C'mere.

570
00:29:25.589 --> 00:29:27.156
- Go after him.
- What?

571
00:29:27.287 --> 00:29:29.376
Go after him.
You should catch up to him.

572
00:29:29.506 --> 00:29:31.465
- And say what?
- And do. listen to me.

573
00:29:31.595 --> 00:29:33.336
This is a teachable moment here.
Claud.

574
00:29:33.467 --> 00:29:34.903
- What would I even say?
- Say...

575
00:29:35.034 --> 00:29:36.731
- Hey.
- How's it goin'. buddy?

576
00:29:38.951 --> 00:29:41.083
Nah. you just give
the guy a BJ.

577
00:29:41.214 --> 00:29:43.346
- Out on the street?
- No. dummy. in his truck.

578
00:29:43.477 --> 00:29:45.827
- But--
- Just proposition the guy.

579
00:29:45.958 --> 00:29:48.134
Look. call me. I'll talk
you through it.

580
00:29:49.352 --> 00:29:50.745
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

581
00:29:50.876 --> 00:29:53.052
And you're still standing
here. Go. go. go. go.

582
00:29:53.617 --> 00:29:55.706
Hi. Larry.

583
00:29:55.837 --> 00:29:58.622
Hey. Claudia.

584
00:29:59.972 --> 00:30:04.280
Um... hi. Joe. Uh. I have
Larry on the phone.

585
00:30:04.411 --> 00:30:06.848
- Joe. you there?
- Uh. yeah. I'm here.

586
00:30:06.979 --> 00:30:10.156
Uh. so Claudia's probably
acting uh...

587
00:30:10.286 --> 00:30:12.549
kinda shy and bizarre right
now. right?

588
00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:14.377
Yeah. pretty much.

589
00:30:14.508 --> 00:30:16.249
Uh. Claudia.

590
00:30:16.379 --> 00:30:20.079
so. this ain't brain surgery.
You. you uh...

591
00:30:20.209 --> 00:30:23.909
you just climb in the truck
and unzip Joe's pants.

592
00:30:26.085 --> 00:30:29.044
This was all Claudia's idea.
by the way. Joe.

593
00:30:29.175 --> 00:30:32.352
- Um. may I?
- Uh yeah. you can.

594
00:30:32.482 --> 00:30:34.963
Okay. now once the prince
is ready.

595
00:30:35.094 --> 00:30:36.965
the king will tell you
what to do with him.

596
00:30:37.096 --> 00:30:38.140
Am I right. Joe?

597
00:30:39.098 --> 00:30:40.273
Uh. yeah.

598
00:30:48.498 --> 00:30:49.499
Thank you.

599
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:52.851
Um. yeah. yeah. Bye.

600
00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:02.730
How ya doin'. Claudia?

601
00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:04.863
Um. I'm not sure
I did a good job.

602
00:31:04.993 --> 00:31:06.777
Did he finish?

603
00:31:06.908 --> 00:31:08.127
Yeah.

604
00:31:08.257 --> 00:31:09.650
You did a good job.

605
00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:11.782
So. why do I feel so gross?

606
00:31:11.913 --> 00:31:14.960
'Cause you're pushing past
your comfort zone.

607
00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:16.962
And I'm proud of you.

608
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.970
Come on now.

609
00:31:25.971 --> 00:31:27.102
I wanna see an improvement
in your lean body mass.

610
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:31.193
I'm looking at 90 % here.
Listen...

611
00:31:31.324 --> 00:31:32.934
You guys...

612
00:31:33.065 --> 00:31:35.328
have been sitting
on the train too long.

613
00:31:35.458 --> 00:31:37.460
School and back.
You're getting fat.

614
00:31:40.507 --> 00:31:42.335
Hold on.
don't unclench.

615
00:31:43.727 --> 00:31:46.252
Hold that position.

616
00:31:48.167 --> 00:31:50.430
Course it's you knocking that
loud. Zhang I can't. all right.

617
00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:51.387
I'm gonna get to you tomorrow.
okay?

618
00:31:51.518 --> 00:31:53.215
Pay the rent.

619
00:31:53.346 --> 00:31:55.261
What if I can't pay the rent?

620
00:31:55.391 --> 00:31:56.740
Then get an attorney.

621
00:31:58.438 --> 00:32:01.702
That is some latent
aggression you're showing.

622
00:32:01.832 --> 00:32:04.923
I can help you with that.
If I wanted to.

623
00:32:08.274 --> 00:32:10.450
What are you doin'?
Get outta there.

624
00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:12.234
No. no. come on.
That's enough of that.

625
00:32:12.365 --> 00:32:13.801
That's enough of that.

626
00:32:13.932 --> 00:32:17.457
All right. gather round.
Sit down.

627
00:32:17.587 --> 00:32:20.721
Got new lesson for ya.

628
00:32:20.851 --> 00:32:23.767
It's a life lesson
you gotta carry with you.

629
00:32:23.898 --> 00:32:25.378
It's gonna be the most important
thing you're gonna ever learn.

630
00:32:25.508 --> 00:32:29.382
It's about personal
responsibility. okay?

631
00:32:29.512 --> 00:32:32.907
I'm gonna need you to make
an itemized list. okay.

632
00:32:33.038 --> 00:32:36.606
of all the things that you have
broken in this apartment.

633
00:32:36.737 --> 00:32:38.347
Like the email
that Santos made.

634
00:32:38.478 --> 00:32:41.611
Exactly. Exactly. Thank you.
So on point.

635
00:32:41.742 --> 00:32:43.222
You feelin' it?
You understand what's happenin'?

636
00:32:43.352 --> 00:32:48.140
So. just like the list
that Santos and Felicia...

637
00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:49.968
- ow. that was. she's--
- She got you.

638
00:32:50.098 --> 00:32:52.753
Seriously? This girl packs
a punch.

639
00:32:52.883 --> 00:32:55.190
Um. just like the list
that they made. um.

640
00:32:55.321 --> 00:32:57.105
but Claudia. I'm gonna start
with you. okay?

641
00:32:57.236 --> 00:32:59.325
- Uh. the oven door.
- Mm-hmm.

642
00:32:59.455 --> 00:33:01.066
...is worth about like.
800 bucks in parts.

643
00:33:01.196 --> 00:33:02.110
- Oh. okay.
- Okay?

644
00:33:02.241 --> 00:33:03.720
No. Larry. that door
was like

645
00:33:03.851 --> 00:33:05.374
that way before Claudia even
cooked that dinner.

646
00:33:05.505 --> 00:33:07.333
No. thank you. Dan. Okay?

647
00:33:07.463 --> 00:33:09.639
You worry about your own willful
damage to my valuable things.

648
00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:11.946
Uh. but right now I got it.

649
00:33:12.077 --> 00:33:16.777
If your student loans can't pay
for it. or your jobs. right.

650
00:33:16.907 --> 00:33:18.387
I'm gonna need you to go to
your parents.

651
00:33:18.518 --> 00:33:21.260
I will pay for the oven
door. Larry. Of course.

652
00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:23.740
Claudia. thank you.
I knew I could rely on you

653
00:33:23.871 --> 00:33:26.004
to do the right thing.

654
00:33:26.134 --> 00:33:29.790
I just want you to know. you are
all 100 % worth it.

655
00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:31.226
I could kick you outta here
any time

656
00:33:31.357 --> 00:33:32.880
and have much more
peace and quiet.

657
00:33:33.011 --> 00:33:35.796
God. you're noisy.
you're stinky.

658
00:33:35.926 --> 00:33:38.277
Gosh.

659
00:33:38.407 --> 00:33:40.192
I don't know. that doesn't
smell bad to me.

660
00:33:40.322 --> 00:33:42.672
I didn't wanna look at him
when I said it but. stinky.

661
00:33:42.803 --> 00:33:45.197
Santos.

662
00:33:45.327 --> 00:33:46.502
All right?
Let's put it all in.

663
00:33:46.633 --> 00:33:48.722
Come on. all in. All in. huh?

664
00:33:48.852 --> 00:33:51.594

00:33:51.725 --> 00:33:53.292

00:33:53.422 --> 00:33:54.336
- Yeah. yeah.

667
00:33:54.467 --> 00:33:55.642
P!

668
00:33:58.558 --> 00:34:00.647
- You got everything?
- Yeah. I think so.

669
00:34:00.777 --> 00:34:02.866
- Oh. don't be a stranger. okay?
- Yeah.

670
00:34:02.997 --> 00:34:05.521
We wanna see you more often.
Come to just. you know.

671
00:34:05.652 --> 00:34:09.656
wash your clothes or. I don't
know. just to say hi.

672
00:34:09.786 --> 00:34:12.180
Yeah. I know.
But you'll be happy to know

673
00:34:12.311 --> 00:34:14.313
that I'm feeling much stronger.

674
00:34:14.443 --> 00:34:15.923
Larry's got us doing
all these exercises.

675
00:34:16.054 --> 00:34:17.490
And I've even been
journaling.

676
00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:19.796
- Wow. Proud of you.
- That's... that's great.

677
00:34:19.927 --> 00:34:21.363
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

678
00:34:21.494 --> 00:34:23.452
Yeah. you know. and Larry
just pays for everything

679
00:34:23.583 --> 00:34:25.672
so I really wanted
to contribute.

680
00:34:25.802 --> 00:34:27.978
Of course. So. we'll
see you soon. yeah?

681
00:34:28.109 --> 00:34:29.415
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay?

682
00:34:29.545 --> 00:34:30.851
- Okay.
- Bye. guys.

683
00:34:30.981 --> 00:34:33.158
- Love you.
- Love you. Bye!

684
00:34:39.207 --> 00:34:40.774
I don't know.

685
00:34:41.992 --> 00:34:43.690
I don't know.

686
00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:46.606
They're giving me $5.000.
which is more than I owe you!

687
00:34:48.999 --> 00:34:51.872
Yeah. that's great. kid.
I really uh. yeah.

688
00:34:52.002 --> 00:34:54.048
I appreciate uh. all the hard
work you're puttin' in.

689
00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:55.919
Well. it's gonna be in
my account tomorrow

690
00:34:56.050 --> 00:34:57.312
and it feels so good to pay
you back

691
00:34:57.443 --> 00:34:58.748
after everything
you've done for me.

692
00:35:00.576 --> 00:35:03.231
Yeah. Santos. you've
really stepped up.

693
00:35:03.362 --> 00:35:06.887
This. I mean. you did good.
Very impressive.

694
00:35:07.017 --> 00:35:11.065
Thank you. Huh? Look at that.
Ain't that somethin'?

695
00:35:12.414 --> 00:35:13.589
Well. Felicia helped me
convince our parents

696
00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.113
that we needed it.

697
00:35:15.243 --> 00:35:16.766
Of course you had something
to do with this

698
00:35:16.897 --> 00:35:19.769
'cause you are such an angel.
Thank you. Thank you both so...

699
00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:24.209
...much.
Really. it's amazing.

700
00:35:24.339 --> 00:35:26.254
Yeah?

701
00:35:26.385 --> 00:35:29.083
Uh. there's a man called
Gordon Ray here to see ya?

702
00:35:29.214 --> 00:35:32.434
Uh. send him up.

703
00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:39.833
Uh. my uh... my stepdad's
comin' up.

704
00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:46.927
Don't tell me you didn't wish
this day would come. Lawrence.

705
00:35:48.798 --> 00:35:51.410
I've always wanted
what's best for you.

706
00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:54.152
And knowing my mother

707
00:35:54.282 --> 00:35:56.719
and I know you didn't marry
the best woman in the world.

708
00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:58.417
So. I have your support then?

709
00:35:58.547 --> 00:36:01.811
Of course. Yeah.

710
00:36:01.942 --> 00:36:06.773
But you gotta know she...
she's not gonna divorce you.

711
00:36:06.903 --> 00:36:09.341
She is gonna take you
for everything you got. sir.

712
00:36:10.211 --> 00:36:11.778
Well. I'm homeless.

713
00:36:12.822 --> 00:36:14.084
What?

714
00:36:14.215 --> 00:36:16.043
And she said if I tried
to divorce her.

715
00:36:16.174 --> 00:36:17.697
she'll fight tooth and nail
to keep

716
00:36:17.827 --> 00:36:19.438
the North Carolina property.

717
00:36:19.568 --> 00:36:20.700
Uh. okay...

718
00:36:22.136 --> 00:36:25.531
No. No. not that.

719
00:36:26.749 --> 00:36:29.404
That is the only...

720
00:36:29.535 --> 00:36:33.321
only place that I consider home.

721
00:36:34.757 --> 00:36:36.933
You made that place a safe
space for me. okay?

722
00:36:37.064 --> 00:36:38.370
And I'm not gonna let her
do that.

723
00:36:39.719 --> 00:36:43.940
You were kind and that's why
I took his last name.

724
00:36:44.071 --> 00:36:45.290
I took his last name.

725
00:36:46.073 --> 00:36:47.814
And I'm proud of it.

726
00:36:47.944 --> 00:36:50.730
All right. so we gotta figure
out how to make sure this woman

727
00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:53.080
does not get her hands
on anything of value.

728
00:36:53.211 --> 00:36:54.734
- Value?
- Yeah.

729
00:36:54.864 --> 00:36:57.737
That whole property's gone
to pot.

730
00:36:57.867 --> 00:36:59.608
Especially since
I've had my heart attacks.

731
00:36:59.739 --> 00:37:01.044
What? What are you
talking about?

732
00:37:01.175 --> 00:37:03.133
Doctors told me if I have one
more heart attack.

733
00:37:03.264 --> 00:37:04.091
it'd be my last.

734
00:37:04.222 --> 00:37:05.788
Okay.

735
00:37:07.834 --> 00:37:10.358
What's this now?

736
00:37:12.099 --> 00:37:13.883
- Oh. my God.
- What?

737
00:37:14.014 --> 00:37:15.450
- Oh. my God.
- What?

738
00:37:15.581 --> 00:37:17.060
- Answer it.
- No. I'm not gonna answer it.

739
00:37:17.191 --> 00:37:18.671
Is that her? Is that her?!

740
00:37:18.801 --> 00:37:20.803
- Answer it.
- Why is she calling me here?

741
00:37:20.934 --> 00:37:22.283
- Answer it.
- What. I'm not answering it!

742
00:37:22.414 --> 00:37:23.502
Answer it!

743
00:37:25.112 --> 00:37:27.114
Yes. sir.
Dad.

744
00:37:28.637 --> 00:37:31.466
Tell your father
to get down here. now!

745
00:37:31.597 --> 00:37:33.555
Get away from here!
You gotta leave me alone!

746
00:37:33.686 --> 00:37:36.689
How the hell did she call me?
Why. what did you do?

747
00:37:36.819 --> 00:37:38.995
What did you do? How does she
know that I'm here?

748
00:37:39.126 --> 00:37:40.693
- Dad. it's okay. she can--
- I'm sorry. Lawrence.

749
00:37:40.823 --> 00:37:42.172
She must have snooped
on my phone.

750
00:37:42.303 --> 00:37:44.174
She can't get up here.
It's okay.

751
00:37:44.305 --> 00:37:46.046
She can't get up here today.
Did any...

752
00:37:46.176 --> 00:37:47.743
I haven't spoken to her in 23
years. What's she doing here?!

753
00:37:47.874 --> 00:37:49.354
Dad. it's okay.

754
00:37:49.484 --> 00:37:51.704
It's not okay. What are you
talking about okay?

755
00:37:51.834 --> 00:37:55.011
She's here and she's here!
Which means soon she'll be...

756
00:37:55.142 --> 00:37:56.752
ah. for the love of God!

757
00:38:00.365 --> 00:38:03.759
Listen. you psycho bitch.
get the hell off my property!

758
00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:06.196
There's a woman here that
claims to be your mother.

759
00:38:06.327 --> 00:38:07.894
She wants to come up.

760
00:38:08.024 --> 00:38:10.810
Yeah. well. you tell her she
can't come up. all right?

761
00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:13.073
Tell her to get the hell away
from me!

762
00:38:13.203 --> 00:38:15.075
You've always been
a disappointment.

763
00:38:16.468 --> 00:38:19.558
All right. you...

764
00:38:40.187 --> 00:38:41.188
- Dad.
- You okay?

765
00:38:41.319 --> 00:38:42.581
Stop it. Leave me alone.

766
00:38:42.711 --> 00:38:46.149
All right. I got it.
We're good. we're good.

767
00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.891
You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna fix. ugh.

768
00:38:49.022 --> 00:38:52.547
we're gonna fix it.
C'mere. C'mere. guys. C'mere.

769
00:38:52.678 --> 00:38:55.333
Kids. here. You're gonna help us
out. all right?

770
00:38:55.463 --> 00:38:58.640
We're gonna help you.
you and me. we're gonna show...

771
00:38:58.771 --> 00:39:01.164
we're gonna show the courts that
you and your stepson

772
00:39:01.295 --> 00:39:02.818
fixed this place up.

773
00:39:02.949 --> 00:39:04.994
That it's something that
she can't get her hands on.

774
00:39:05.125 --> 00:39:07.127
You understand what I'm saying?
And these kids.

775
00:39:07.257 --> 00:39:08.998
these amazing kids.
they're gonna help us. right?

776
00:39:09.129 --> 00:39:10.957
You're gonna...
you're gonna look after my dad.

777
00:39:11.087 --> 00:39:12.741
- Promise me you're gonna look...
- Yeah.

778
00:39:12.872 --> 00:39:16.049
Okay. The rest of us we're
gonna go down to North Carolina.

779
00:39:16.179 --> 00:39:20.619
You ever been? And what we're
gonna do is we're gonna...

780
00:39:20.749 --> 00:39:22.534
we're gonna bust our asses
'cause we're good at it.

781
00:39:22.664 --> 00:39:24.449
You see these tools?
We're builders.

782
00:39:24.579 --> 00:39:26.189
And we're gonna build the crap
outta this house.

783
00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:30.629
I'm tellin' ya. Whew.
So... we're gonna...

784
00:39:49.125 --> 00:39:51.737
Claudia. Claudia.
what are you doin'?

785
00:39:51.867 --> 00:39:55.044
What are you doin'?
Use a wheelbarrow.

786
00:39:55.175 --> 00:39:58.091
Ah. sorry. I'm not an idiot.
I'm just a city girl.

787
00:39:58.221 --> 00:40:00.354
Well. listen. city girl.

788
00:40:00.485 --> 00:40:01.964
your job ain't done 'til
the trench is filled.

789
00:40:02.095 --> 00:40:03.618
- Okay.
- All the way up.

790
00:40:03.749 --> 00:40:05.838
I just want you to know
that I might not be able

791
00:40:05.968 --> 00:40:07.274
to get the trench filled
by dinner time.

792
00:40:07.405 --> 00:40:08.884
Did you not volunteer
to come here?

793
00:40:09.015 --> 00:40:11.583
- Yeah.
- Did you not offer

794
00:40:11.713 --> 00:40:14.673
to help my stepfather and me
to fix this place up?

795
00:40:14.803 --> 00:40:16.718
- Yes.
- Okay then. if we do not...

796
00:40:16.849 --> 00:40:19.547
do this job properly.
- Hey.

797
00:40:19.678 --> 00:40:22.158
Then the only parent
that cared about me

798
00:40:22.289 --> 00:40:23.986
is gonna have a fatal
heart attack!

799
00:40:24.117 --> 00:40:25.510
Mm-hmm. yes. I do.
I am sorry.

800
00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.816
- I did not mean to complain.
- I know. Come here.

801
00:40:27.947 --> 00:40:30.515
- Listen. you got this.
- Mm-hmm.

802
00:40:30.645 --> 00:40:34.127
All right? And the key
is you... look at Felicia.

803
00:40:34.257 --> 00:40:36.956
She's... she understands that
the pride that you take

804
00:40:37.086 --> 00:40:41.003
in achieving this gives you such
a sense of accomplishment.

805
00:40:41.134 --> 00:40:43.136
and that's what we're trying
to get here.

806
00:40:43.266 --> 00:40:47.053
That is the whole point
that is Q4P!

807
00:41:01.328 --> 00:41:04.810
Felicia. you done?

808
00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:06.420
Yes.

809
00:41:06.551 --> 00:41:08.466
All right. you can go
back to your porch.

810
00:41:13.035 --> 00:41:14.341
Where's she going?

811
00:41:14.472 --> 00:41:16.691
- She's sleeping on the porch.
- Why?

812
00:41:16.822 --> 00:41:19.738
Because that's what she thinks
is best for her right now.

813
00:41:19.868 --> 00:41:21.174
Are you done?

814
00:41:22.349 --> 00:41:23.916
All right. then get inside.

815
00:41:27.876 --> 00:41:31.358
Now. look. careful. all right?
Look at this. You--

816
00:41:31.489 --> 00:41:32.794
- Oh. my God. Larry.
- Look at that.

817
00:41:32.925 --> 00:41:34.927
You should go to the doctor.

818
00:41:35.057 --> 00:41:37.669
The stress of making sure
this place is perfect

819
00:41:37.799 --> 00:41:39.540
is wreaking havoc
on my immune system.

820
00:41:39.671 --> 00:41:41.194
Well. I'll try harder
tomorrow. I will.

821
00:41:41.324 --> 00:41:43.283
Good. 'cause I need you to
understand how important it is

822
00:41:43.413 --> 00:41:45.328
that we make this place perfect.

823
00:41:46.721 --> 00:41:48.636
If we don't fix this.
Gordon's gonna lose it all

824
00:41:48.767 --> 00:41:50.899
in the divorce. and then
my sick. selfish mother.

825
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:52.771
she's gonna win
and we can't let that happen.

826
00:41:52.901 --> 00:41:54.120
And I need to know you
understand that.

827
00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:56.339
- I do!
- No. you don't understand.

828
00:41:56.470 --> 00:42:00.082
That woman was a monster! She
used to put poison in my food

829
00:42:00.213 --> 00:42:01.867
and she used to stay up
all night

830
00:42:01.997 --> 00:42:04.260
and laugh at me while
I was vomiting.

831
00:42:04.391 --> 00:42:06.654
- All right? You understand that?
- I. I understand.

832
00:42:06.785 --> 00:42:08.395
We will not let her win. Larry!
I promise!

833
00:42:08.526 --> 00:42:10.179
- You got that right!
- Yeah!

834
00:42:16.055 --> 00:42:18.144
They want me to set up a
meeting with Giuliani.

835
00:42:18.274 --> 00:42:21.321
So. I do. He's late for
the meeting.

836
00:42:21.451 --> 00:42:24.367
Why? Wants to go to
Radio City Music Hall

837
00:42:24.498 --> 00:42:26.979
and meet the Rockettes.
Hmm.

838
00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:29.198
So. why does she
wanna stay outside?

839
00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:32.811
Dad! Dad. Dad. Dad.
in the garage.

840
00:42:32.941 --> 00:42:34.247
What? What. yeah?

841
00:42:34.377 --> 00:42:35.901
In the garage the...
I was parking the car

842
00:42:36.031 --> 00:42:38.120
and I got out and there was
a massive spider.

843
00:42:38.251 --> 00:42:40.645
Look. Look! Look!

844
00:42:43.038 --> 00:42:45.780
That's... that's a Sydney
Weaver spider.

845
00:42:45.911 --> 00:42:48.174
That's the worst of the
worst kid. That's...

846
00:42:48.304 --> 00:42:52.613
Dad. The rash on your arms.
Could be spider bites.

847
00:42:52.744 --> 00:42:54.180
I mean. how poisonous
are these things?

848
00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:55.355
Oh. just... Isabella!

849
00:42:56.443 --> 00:42:58.793
C'mere! Wake up Felicia!

850
00:42:58.924 --> 00:43:00.882
There is a giant spider
in the garage.

851
00:43:01.013 --> 00:43:03.145
I need you to go get it
and I need you to kill it.

852
00:43:03.276 --> 00:43:05.757
You need to crush that thing.
Find it. Show 'em.

853
00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:10.675
We've looked under everything.

854
00:43:12.111 --> 00:43:14.200
Yeah. maybe it made its home
somewhere else. hey?

855
00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:16.332
Maybe it escaped. Lar?

856
00:43:16.463 --> 00:43:18.683
How'd it get in here in
the first place

857
00:43:18.813 --> 00:43:20.032
is what I need to know.

858
00:43:25.124 --> 00:43:28.562
Claudia. my rash didn't
erupt until you arrived.

859
00:43:28.693 --> 00:43:30.564
Yeah. yeah. that's true.

860
00:43:30.695 --> 00:43:33.698
Claudia. is there something
you wanna confess to me?

861
00:43:35.395 --> 00:43:38.267
Larry. are you thinking that
I brought it here from New York?

862
00:43:38.398 --> 00:43:39.878
That I could bring
a deadly spider--

863
00:43:40.008 --> 00:43:42.141
Did my mother come
to see you. Claudia?

864
00:43:42.271 --> 00:43:44.317
No. I stayed at
my parents' place.

865
00:43:44.447 --> 00:43:46.362
Claudia. did you stay
at our place ever

866
00:43:46.493 --> 00:43:47.929
while Grandpa Ray was there?

867
00:43:49.452 --> 00:43:52.673
Um... yeah. Yeah. yeah. yeah.
the last night. I stayed with...

868
00:43:52.804 --> 00:43:54.501
Santos because he wasn't
feeling well.

869
00:43:54.632 --> 00:43:56.677
I mean. so you were there
with Gordon

870
00:43:56.808 --> 00:43:59.375
and you were with Santos.
And who else?

871
00:43:59.506 --> 00:44:00.986
- No one.
- No. who else was there?

872
00:44:01.116 --> 00:44:03.641
No one. It was just
the three of us.

873
00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.774
I can't imagine the kind
of person you've become

874
00:44:06.905 --> 00:44:08.558
if you are lying
to me right now.

875
00:44:09.690 --> 00:44:12.562
Make sure the dirt to rock
ratio is right.

876
00:44:12.693 --> 00:44:15.653
You got more rock than
you got dirt! Use more dirt!

877
00:44:15.783 --> 00:44:18.177
You got too much dirt.
you need...

878
00:44:18.307 --> 00:44:20.527
I mean. too much rock!
You need more--

879
00:44:20.658 --> 00:44:22.660
You have got to be kidding me.

880
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:24.444
- I am so sorry. Larry.
- Are you kidding me?

881
00:44:24.574 --> 00:44:26.054
I'm so sorry.
I was just shovel--

882
00:44:26.185 --> 00:44:28.317
Now. don't... this arm was
going like this. Why?

883
00:44:28.448 --> 00:44:29.536
'Cause it's picking up dirt!

884
00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:31.016
What are you doin' with
the wheelbarrow?

885
00:44:31.146 --> 00:44:32.626
No. I was just shoveling
the dirt!

886
00:44:32.757 --> 00:44:34.715
I don't need you to shovel!
No one needs you to shovel!

887
00:44:34.846 --> 00:44:36.325
- That's a giant shovel!
- I'm so sorry!

888
00:44:36.456 --> 00:44:37.849
It was an accident!

889
00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:41.069
What did...
what did you just say?

890
00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:42.854
- It was just an accident.
- What did you just say?

891
00:44:42.984 --> 00:44:45.378
You said the word?

892
00:44:45.508 --> 00:44:47.119
Accident?
That was an accident!

893
00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:52.951
Ah. listen.
Just relax. would ya?

894
00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:57.607
First she brings my mother's
hate down here and then she...

895
00:44:57.738 --> 00:45:00.349
she destroys the most expensive
piece of equipment!

896
00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:01.742
- Would you go after her?
- Yes!

897
00:45:01.873 --> 00:45:03.265
- What are you doin'?
- Got it!

898
00:45:03.396 --> 00:45:04.832
Standin' there. Go! Go!
I'll get my car.

899
00:45:04.963 --> 00:45:06.616
I'll cut her off in a minute.

900
00:45:06.747 --> 00:45:08.706
All right.

901
00:45:20.326 --> 00:45:21.588
Claudia!

902
00:45:23.851 --> 00:45:25.723
Claudia. quit runnin'!

903
00:45:29.204 --> 00:45:31.206
Claudia. stop!

904
00:45:39.649 --> 00:45:41.042
Hi. Claud.

905
00:45:43.697 --> 00:45:47.309
He's up there. If we go
now we can outrun him.

906
00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:49.572
Claud. we're not going to run.

907
00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:52.750
It's like he's lost his mind.
Izzy.

908
00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:54.360
I mean. he's paranoid.
he's abusive.

909
00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:55.491
He's not abusive.

910
00:45:55.622 --> 00:45:56.971
He pushed me

911
00:45:57.102 --> 00:45:58.320
and said horrible.
vicious things to me.

912
00:45:58.451 --> 00:46:01.933
Well. you destroyed a very.
very expensive

913
00:46:02.063 --> 00:46:05.371
piece of heavy machinery. Okay?

914
00:46:05.501 --> 00:46:08.330
He overreacted. yeah.
but he's not abusive.

915
00:46:08.461 --> 00:46:11.333
I just. I can't believe
you're defending him.

916
00:46:11.464 --> 00:46:14.902
The way he's treating Felicia
like she's a dog.

917
00:46:15.033 --> 00:46:16.991
You're feeling sorry
for Felicia?

918
00:46:17.122 --> 00:46:20.038
She's been impossible to deal
with down here.

919
00:46:20.168 --> 00:46:24.520
I just can't. I can't.
I wanna go home.

920
00:46:27.175 --> 00:46:31.310
Then go! You're all free.
Everyone is free to go!

921
00:46:32.702 --> 00:46:37.882
What... what is home? Claud.
what is it? Where is it?

922
00:46:38.012 --> 00:46:40.406
Who is home?
You think it's your parents?

923
00:46:40.536 --> 00:46:43.322
You think... that is who
you are running from.

924
00:46:44.889 --> 00:46:48.631
The Claudia they knew.
she doesn't exist anymore.

925
00:46:48.762 --> 00:46:53.071
This Claudia. this one right
here. she is loved.

926
00:46:54.333 --> 00:46:58.816
She's adored. And she is
treasured by a real family.

927
00:47:00.513 --> 00:47:02.254
I was cruel today.

928
00:47:03.342 --> 00:47:06.780
I admit it.
I'm only human.

929
00:47:06.911 --> 00:47:09.957
Always had your back.
Question is. who's got my back?

930
00:47:10.088 --> 00:47:14.005
Thing about loyalty. If
loyalty is not shared equally.

931
00:47:14.135 --> 00:47:16.790
you know. then you should go.

932
00:47:16.921 --> 00:47:22.100
And frankly. I want you to go
because I love you too much.

933
00:47:23.579 --> 00:47:26.104
And it hurts too much.

934
00:47:29.977 --> 00:47:31.457
I don't wanna go.

935
00:47:44.862 --> 00:47:48.691
Hello. Anybody home?
We're back!

936
00:47:48.822 --> 00:47:50.780
- We're here.
- Surprise!

937
00:47:50.911 --> 00:47:53.392
- Oh. geez. Oh.
- Welcome home.

938
00:47:53.522 --> 00:47:55.350
- Aw. thanks.
- I made some canapes.

939
00:47:55.481 --> 00:47:58.353
It has some... a little mint
on top. I know you like mint.

940
00:47:58.484 --> 00:48:01.008
So. what did Gordon think of
the work you did on the place?

941
00:48:02.009 --> 00:48:03.837
Ah. he was real grateful.

942
00:48:03.968 --> 00:48:05.752
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I mean. geez. we...

943
00:48:07.232 --> 00:48:09.538
we pulled off a miracle.
didn't we?

944
00:48:09.669 --> 00:48:11.540
Yeah. place looks amazing.

945
00:48:13.542 --> 00:48:14.761
All right. where's Dan?

946
00:48:15.936 --> 00:48:19.070
Um... uh. sorry. Larry.

947
00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:20.854
Dan decided to go
a couple weeks ago.

948
00:48:20.985 --> 00:48:22.116
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

949
00:48:22.247 --> 00:48:23.422
Go where?

950
00:48:23.552 --> 00:48:25.598
I think he went back
to his parents.

951
00:48:25.728 --> 00:48:27.034
Oh.

952
00:48:28.514 --> 00:48:30.124
Why would he do that?

953
00:48:30.255 --> 00:48:32.257
I think he had a change
of heart

954
00:48:32.387 --> 00:48:35.390
about being part of your...
our family.

955
00:48:37.175 --> 00:48:38.654
Will you sit down there
with the kids for a minute?

956
00:48:38.785 --> 00:48:40.265
Thanks a lot.

957
00:48:41.005 --> 00:48:44.008
So. yeah. um... c'mere. Sorry.

958
00:48:47.185 --> 00:48:51.102
Did Dan talk to Claudia
while she was down there?

959
00:48:52.146 --> 00:48:53.713
They... may have kept
in touch.

960
00:48:53.843 --> 00:48:55.062
- Yeah?
- I don't know.

961
00:48:58.022 --> 00:49:00.589
Hey. Tal. can I talk to you
in the bedroom for a minute?

962
00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:01.939
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

963
00:49:05.464 --> 00:49:08.423
- What? What is it?
- I think Claudia got to Dan.

964
00:49:09.555 --> 00:49:10.730
- Really?
- Yeah.

965
00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:12.340
- Tainted his opinion of me.
- No way.

966
00:49:12.471 --> 00:49:14.125
Yeah way.

967
00:49:14.255 --> 00:49:15.648
And I thought that you
two worked things out

968
00:49:15.778 --> 00:49:17.955
after she ran away?
- Listen to me.

969
00:49:18.085 --> 00:49:20.870
You keep your friends close
but your enemies closer.

970
00:49:21.001 --> 00:49:23.395
She is only pretending
to be loyal.

971
00:49:23.525 --> 00:49:26.528
She owes me a lot of money
for the Bobcat that she broke.

972
00:49:26.659 --> 00:49:29.444
Right? She takes me down.
she doesn't have to pay.

973
00:49:29.575 --> 00:49:31.751
This is what I want you to do.
I want you to take her out.

974
00:49:31.881 --> 00:49:33.144
I want you to take her
for a drink.

975
00:49:33.274 --> 00:49:35.059
I want you to get her talkin'.
okay?

976
00:49:35.189 --> 00:49:38.279
And then if she's hidin'
somethin'. which I know she is.

977
00:49:38.410 --> 00:49:40.020
You will find it.
You will hear it.

978
00:49:40.151 --> 00:49:41.239
Yeah.

979
00:49:41.369 --> 00:49:42.501
And you will let me know.
Okay?

980
00:49:42.631 --> 00:49:43.676
- For sure.
- Canapes.

981
00:49:43.806 --> 00:49:44.633
Let's do it.

982
00:49:47.985 --> 00:49:50.248
Larry! Larry! Talia's sick!

983
00:49:50.378 --> 00:49:52.467
Tal. no. Where's Tal?

984
00:49:52.598 --> 00:49:54.861
I don't know. I just brought
her home and we were at the bar

985
00:49:54.992 --> 00:49:56.602
and she ordered a lot of wine
and she got very drunk.

986
00:49:56.732 --> 00:49:58.169
Where's my baby girl?

987
00:49:58.299 --> 00:50:00.606
She's in the bathroom.
She's vomiting.

988
00:50:00.736 --> 00:50:03.478
She's vomiting? Why is she
vomiting? What'd you do to her?

989
00:50:08.962 --> 00:50:10.398
Did you roofie her?

990
00:50:10.529 --> 00:50:12.574
You're the only one I told
my mother poisoned me!

991
00:50:12.705 --> 00:50:14.185
I wouldn't do it!

992
00:50:16.752 --> 00:50:18.493
Again.

993
00:50:18.624 --> 00:50:21.757
I went into the bar
and I ordered a rum and Coke.

994
00:50:21.888 --> 00:50:25.457
And then Talia came in
and she ordered a red wine.

995
00:50:25.587 --> 00:50:27.546
And at what point did
you decide to harm Tal?

996
00:50:27.676 --> 00:50:30.853
What? I wouldn't harm
Talia. What... ow!

997
00:50:30.984 --> 00:50:33.508
Don't use that tone with me.
I'll tell you why.

998
00:50:33.639 --> 00:50:35.380
Because you owe me 100 grand!

999
00:50:36.511 --> 00:50:38.209
I didn't know it
was that much.

1000
00:50:38.339 --> 00:50:42.517
That is what I owe the rental
company! Because of you. Claud!

1001
00:50:42.648 --> 00:50:46.173
And I know what your plan is.
You poison Tal.

1002
00:50:46.304 --> 00:50:48.610
you poison me. then you don't
have to pay us back!

1003
00:50:48.741 --> 00:50:52.701
That's what you're doin'!
I'm not dumb!

1004
00:50:57.228 --> 00:50:58.838
You gotta choose. Claudia.

1005
00:51:00.057 --> 00:51:03.495
You gotta confess
to what you did.

1006
00:51:04.409 --> 00:51:06.106
Come clean.

1007
00:51:07.499 --> 00:51:11.198
Or I call my lawyer and I sue
you and your parents

1008
00:51:11.329 --> 00:51:12.895
for the 100 grand you owe me!

1009
00:51:15.115 --> 00:51:16.899
Can you just tell me
what to say

1010
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:18.858
and how to say it. Larry?

1011
00:51:18.988 --> 00:51:22.427
Because I keep trying
and I keep getting it wrong.

1012
00:51:24.733 --> 00:51:28.868
Hey. wake up! Who was it who
got to ya?

1013
00:51:28.998 --> 00:51:31.914
My ex? My mother?

1014
00:51:32.045 --> 00:51:34.003
Huh. who you in cahoots with?

1015
00:51:34.134 --> 00:51:35.701
Kerik?

1016
00:51:35.831 --> 00:51:38.095
Are you in bed with
those vicious bastards?

1017
00:51:39.574 --> 00:51:42.621
You know you done something
morally wrong.

1018
00:51:44.884 --> 00:51:49.280
Your mind has chosen to forget.

1019
00:51:50.977 --> 00:51:55.460
So. I'm giving you the chance
to come clean. And remember...

1020
00:51:59.551 --> 00:52:02.119
Yeah. I. I do remember now.

1021
00:52:02.249 --> 00:52:05.774
I remember that I did wanna hurt
you and Talia.

1022
00:52:06.775 --> 00:52:10.170
Okay.
Now we are getting somewhere.

1023
00:52:10.301 --> 00:52:14.522
How did you hurt me and Talia?

1024
00:52:14.653 --> 00:52:19.266
I poisoned you. I got lots of
different harmful substances

1025
00:52:19.397 --> 00:52:21.616
and I...

1026
00:52:21.747 --> 00:52:27.579
I used microdoses of mercury
poisoning and I used rat poison.

1027
00:52:27.709 --> 00:52:31.757
And I... it's how much
attention I need. It's my fault.

1028
00:52:31.887 --> 00:52:33.628
Uh-huh.

1029
00:52:34.977 --> 00:52:37.023
You're recording this. right?
Don't see my hammer.

1030
00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:40.157
Who put you up to it?

1031
00:52:40.287 --> 00:52:43.986
Your mom.
And... and Talia's mom.

1032
00:52:44.117 --> 00:52:46.293
- Uh-huh.
- And Bernie Kerik.

1033
00:52:46.424 --> 00:52:50.471
Your mom gave me the spider. And
I brought it to North Carolina

1034
00:52:50.602 --> 00:52:53.170
so that you could be poisoned.

1035
00:52:54.693 --> 00:52:56.956
More than I expected.
but that's good.

1036
00:52:57.086 --> 00:52:59.524
We're finally gettin' the truth.
huh? How's it feel?

1037
00:53:00.394 --> 00:53:01.700
To speak truth?

1038
00:53:02.309 --> 00:53:03.571
It feels good.

1039
00:53:03.702 --> 00:53:06.139
Right? Listen. you did good.

1040
00:53:07.488 --> 00:53:12.058
You did good. Claudia. C'mere.
Oh. God. Right there.

1041
00:53:18.064 --> 00:53:22.416
So. we finally get to meet
the Larry Ray.

1042
00:53:22.547 --> 00:53:24.244
To what do we owe the honor?

1043
00:53:25.724 --> 00:53:28.422
Well. Claudia asked me to come
here today to speak for her.

1044
00:53:28.553 --> 00:53:31.512
Because Claudia can't
speak for herself?

1045
00:53:31.643 --> 00:53:34.428
Well no. because Claudia
owes me a lot of money.

1046
00:53:34.559 --> 00:53:36.256
And she's having trouble
with confrontation.

1047
00:53:36.387 --> 00:53:37.823
Does she?

1048
00:53:37.953 --> 00:53:39.651
It's really serious this
time. Dad.

1049
00:53:39.781 --> 00:53:42.828
I broke a really important piece
of heavy machinery.

1050
00:53:42.958 --> 00:53:44.873
I doubt that's true.

1051
00:53:45.004 --> 00:53:47.267
So. you've come to gouge us
for more money. That's it?

1052
00:53:47.398 --> 00:53:50.227
- Gouge?
- Well. we don't have it.

1053
00:53:50.357 --> 00:53:53.186
I'm sure Claudia's told you that
her mother and I

1054
00:53:53.317 --> 00:53:54.709
are getting a divorce so.
all our money is...

1055
00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:56.929
I haven't told her that yet.

1056
00:53:58.452 --> 00:54:00.541
- I haven't told her that.
- I'm sorry. I can't do this.

1057
00:54:00.672 --> 00:54:03.762
Claudia. I love you. but if I'm
in the presence of this man

1058
00:54:03.892 --> 00:54:07.026
for another minute. I don't know
what I'm gonna do. You creep.

1059
00:54:07.156 --> 00:54:08.810
I thought that you guys were
having a separation?

1060
00:54:08.941 --> 00:54:10.682
That you were seeing
a counselor?

1061
00:54:10.812 --> 00:54:12.988
Claudia. just... we've been
struggling and I'm just...

1062
00:54:13.119 --> 00:54:15.904
I'm sorry. God dammit.
get your hands off of her.

1063
00:54:16.035 --> 00:54:21.214
May I tell you something?
Claudia suffers from harm OCD.

1064
00:54:21.345 --> 00:54:24.348
Okay? Which means she
obsessively has to harm people.

1065
00:54:24.478 --> 00:54:27.438
She has been poisoning
my daughter and me.

1066
00:54:27.568 --> 00:54:30.702
Oh. God! What?
That can't be true.

1067
00:54:30.832 --> 00:54:32.530
- She confessed to it.
- Yes. it's true.

1068
00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:34.619
- I don't believe you.
- It's true.

1069
00:54:34.749 --> 00:54:37.448
He's making this up.
He's... he's feeding you lies!

1070
00:54:37.578 --> 00:54:39.450
I know about your stillborn.

1071
00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:45.412
And how Claudia. your living
daughter. who is right here.

1072
00:54:45.543 --> 00:54:47.196
could never live up--

1073
00:54:47.327 --> 00:54:48.589
You are a horrible.
horrible man.

1074
00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:50.025
- ...into your dead baby.
- Come on.

1075
00:54:50.156 --> 00:54:52.158
Claudia. Claudia. no!
Don't listen to him.

1076
00:54:52.289 --> 00:54:54.595
Hey. hey!
What's going on here?

1077
00:54:54.726 --> 00:54:56.554
I'm not dragging here away.

1078
00:54:56.684 --> 00:54:58.207
Claudia. Claudia.
don't listen to him.

1079
00:54:58.338 --> 00:54:59.905
Am I dragging
your daughter away?

1080
00:55:00.035 --> 00:55:01.994
- Claudia. please listen to us.
- Is she coming on her own

1081
00:55:02.124 --> 00:55:04.736
volition? I think so.
- Claudia. please don't.

1082
00:55:04.866 --> 00:55:06.433
Please don't go.

1083
00:55:14.963 --> 00:55:16.313
Oh. God.

1084
00:55:18.097 --> 00:55:19.838
What is happening?

1085
00:55:29.717 --> 00:55:33.286
I shouldn't have done it.
I ruined everything.

1086
00:55:38.247 --> 00:55:40.467
What's that. huh?

1087
00:55:42.643 --> 00:55:44.079
Did you take these?

1088
00:55:44.210 --> 00:55:45.994
You take all of these?

1089
00:55:46.125 --> 00:55:49.128
You kidding me?
Are you all right? Come on!

1090
00:55:54.612 --> 00:55:55.352
- No. no.
- I am so sorry.

1091
00:55:55.482 --> 00:55:58.703
No. no. no. Shh.

1092
00:55:58.833 --> 00:56:03.316
For being a huge
burden on you.

1093
00:56:03.447 --> 00:56:05.362
- Oh no. listen to me.
- And on everybody.

1094
00:56:05.492 --> 00:56:11.237
Listen to me. You. you...
are a precious human soul.

1095
00:56:11.368 --> 00:56:14.501
And you've never been a burden.

1096
00:56:14.632 --> 00:56:18.984
Not to me. not... any...
I'll be right back.

1097
00:56:19.114 --> 00:56:22.509
Hi. hi. we're here
to see Claudia Drury.

1098
00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:24.729
- Claudia Drury. oh um--
- I'm sorry. nurse.

1099
00:56:24.859 --> 00:56:26.948
these people are not allowed
into Claudia Drury's room.

1100
00:56:27.079 --> 00:56:28.515
What?

1101
00:56:28.646 --> 00:56:30.909
- Oh. your names?
- Christian and Tom Drury.

1102
00:56:31.039 --> 00:56:34.129
Did this man tell you that we
cannot see our own daughter?

1103
00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:35.522
No. ma'am. it was
your daughter

1104
00:56:35.653 --> 00:56:37.089
who signed the do not admit.

1105
00:56:37.219 --> 00:56:38.699
What? I'd like to
see that. please.

1106
00:56:38.830 --> 00:56:40.005
Take a look all you want.

1107
00:56:40.135 --> 00:56:41.659
There is no way that
she signed this

1108
00:56:41.789 --> 00:56:43.225
without being coerced.
- I'm sorry.

1109
00:56:43.356 --> 00:56:46.490
But it is a patient's legal
right to refuse visitors.

1110
00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:49.231
If you would've spent
a little more time

1111
00:56:49.362 --> 00:56:51.973
focusing on your daughter
instead of your marital issues--

1112
00:56:52.104 --> 00:56:53.322
What?

1113
00:56:53.453 --> 00:56:55.150
...Claudia wouldn't
be here right now.

1114
00:56:55.281 --> 00:56:57.979
- How dare you?
- I wanna see your supervisor.

1115
00:56:58.110 --> 00:56:59.764
Everything okay?

1116
00:57:01.243 --> 00:57:03.115
Made damn sure that it was.

1117
00:57:05.770 --> 00:57:08.729
I don't wanna be like this
anymore. Larry.

1118
00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:10.427
I need to change.

1119
00:57:19.653 --> 00:57:21.307
I know what you need.

1120
00:57:23.004 --> 00:57:25.093
You need a direction.

1121
00:57:25.224 --> 00:57:28.532
And... you need a focus.

1122
00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:32.536
You need to take back the power

1123
00:57:32.666 --> 00:57:34.842
that the world's taken away
from you.

1124
00:57:34.973 --> 00:57:37.018
And you need to be in
the driver's seat.

1125
00:57:37.149 --> 00:57:38.716
Of your own life again.

1126
00:57:38.846 --> 00:57:40.195
'cause we're goin' up. kid.

1127
00:57:40.326 --> 00:57:41.675
We're goin' up!

1128
00:57:49.901 --> 00:57:52.381
Psst. psst. psst.

1129
00:57:52.512 --> 00:57:55.341
How ya feeling. champ?

1130
00:57:55.472 --> 00:57:57.778
Hmm. still a bit
fragile but better.

1131
00:57:57.909 --> 00:57:59.388
Good.

1132
00:57:59.519 --> 00:58:01.521
Is that my journal?

1133
00:58:01.652 --> 00:58:03.305
- What journal?
- That one.

1134
00:58:03.436 --> 00:58:05.394
Oh. this one here? Yeah. Um.
oh you mean your senior journal.

1135
00:58:05.525 --> 00:58:06.918
Yeah.

1136
00:58:07.048 --> 00:58:09.660
Which means it's your
journal time. isn't it?

1137
00:58:09.790 --> 00:58:12.358
- My turn?
- Yeah. move over. move over.

1138
00:58:12.489 --> 00:58:15.100
All right. c'mere. c'mere.
Okay. okay.

1139
00:58:15.230 --> 00:58:17.406
Oh. this was that thing you
wrote when you met that guy.

1140
00:58:17.537 --> 00:58:18.669
- Oh.
- At that place.

1141
00:58:18.799 --> 00:58:20.105
- The one that. who--
- With the thing.

1142
00:58:20.235 --> 00:58:21.759
He liked rope play?

1143
00:58:21.889 --> 00:58:23.325
I believe
it's called a tie-up.

1144
00:58:23.456 --> 00:58:25.502
Is it not called a tie-up?

1145
00:58:25.632 --> 00:58:29.680
Well. once upon a tie-up...

1146
00:58:29.810 --> 00:58:35.642
"It was amazing. I felt opened
up in this completely new way

1147
00:58:35.773 --> 00:58:39.994
like. oh wow. this is who I am.
And it was even better

1148
00:58:40.125 --> 00:58:44.390
because he was a stranger."

1149
00:58:47.393 --> 00:58:48.742
I mean. you clearly felt
more like.

1150
00:58:48.873 --> 00:58:50.918
free during this encounter
than most.

1151
00:58:51.049 --> 00:58:52.920
Yeah. it was a wild night.

1152
00:58:53.051 --> 00:58:54.487
Yeah.

1153
00:58:54.618 --> 00:58:56.707
What is this about. though?

1154
00:59:00.232 --> 00:59:02.408
We totally think you
should get into escort.

1155
00:59:02.539 --> 00:59:04.192
What?

1156
00:59:04.323 --> 00:59:05.890
- I'm serious.
- Seriously!

1157
00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:08.196
What like...
like prostitution?

1158
00:59:08.327 --> 00:59:09.502
- Not prostitution.
- No!

1159
00:59:09.633 --> 00:59:11.417
No. no. no. sex work.

1160
00:59:11.548 --> 00:59:14.072
Specifically BDSM sex work
'cause...

1161
00:59:14.202 --> 00:59:15.421
Just because I liked it once

1162
00:59:15.552 --> 00:59:17.771
doesn't mean that I'll like
it again.

1163
00:59:17.902 --> 00:59:20.208
- Or for... money.
- You sure about that?

1164
00:59:20.339 --> 00:59:22.036
- Huh. wait for it.
- It gets better.

1165
00:59:22.167 --> 00:59:25.039
Wait for it. "I know
this makes no sense

1166
00:59:25.170 --> 00:59:28.173
but having him completely
take over.

1167
00:59:28.303 --> 00:59:33.831
having to surrender.
made me feel more powerful.

1168
00:59:33.961 --> 00:59:35.397
But it was cathartic."

1169
00:59:36.616 --> 00:59:37.922
- I wrote that.
- Yeah.

1170
00:59:38.052 --> 00:59:39.271
You did.

1171
00:59:39.401 --> 00:59:41.882
That was you.
I mean. that was you.

1172
00:59:42.013 --> 00:59:43.841
You wrote that with... when no
one was looking.

1173
00:59:43.971 --> 00:59:45.669
So. that means
that was your truth.

1174
00:59:48.541 --> 00:59:52.240
Look. I know you hate yourself
'cause you harmed Tal.

1175
00:59:52.371 --> 00:59:56.331
I know you hate yourself 'cause
you owe me a lot of money.

1176
00:59:56.462 --> 00:59:57.811
And I know you hate yourself

1177
00:59:57.942 --> 00:59:59.987
'cause your parents' marriage
exploded.

1178
01:00:00.118 --> 01:00:04.818
But instead of being
the basket case. you know.

1179
01:00:04.949 --> 01:00:08.517
why don't you flip that
self-loathing into...

1180
01:00:08.648 --> 01:00:10.563
into self-empowerment?

1181
01:00:10.694 --> 01:00:14.045
'Cause you would crush it
in the BDSM scene.

1182
01:00:14.175 --> 01:00:17.309
I'm tellin' ya.
You scrubbed perfect. kid.

1183
01:00:17.439 --> 01:00:18.832
- You're the girl next door.
- Mm-hmm.

1184
01:00:18.963 --> 01:00:23.445
Super clean cut. God.
They'd pay a fortune for this.

1185
01:00:23.576 --> 01:00:25.926
I'm just sayin'. And you could
get. you can go shopping

1186
01:00:26.057 --> 01:00:29.364
for outfits with Izzy. right?
You can get outfits.

1187
01:00:29.495 --> 01:00:31.192
What else they have?
They have like. props.

1188
01:00:31.323 --> 01:00:34.152
and they got toys. I'm just
sayin'. it'd be fun.

1189
01:00:50.951 --> 01:00:54.520
- Fiona?
- Greyson. right? Come on in.

1190
01:01:04.573 --> 01:01:06.401
I like what you're wearing.

1191
01:01:06.532 --> 01:01:08.795
Under the robe. I mean.

1192
01:01:10.057 --> 01:01:11.493
Take it off.

1193
01:01:14.322 --> 01:01:18.326
Could you show me what... show
me what you'd like me to do?

1194
01:01:23.941 --> 01:01:26.160
Come over here. Fiona.

1195
01:01:35.169 --> 01:01:37.781
There's our star player now.

1196
01:01:37.911 --> 01:01:40.435
Well. you were generous
with your time.

1197
01:01:40.566 --> 01:01:41.828
What are you... okay. what are
you doing?

1198
01:01:41.959 --> 01:01:43.700
Put that... no. give it to me.

1199
01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:45.876
But I don't want
your purse. Gimme the...

1200
01:01:46.006 --> 01:01:48.313
You don't hand money
around like that.

1201
01:01:48.443 --> 01:01:50.010
Gotta be discreet.
This is a class joint.

1202
01:01:53.448 --> 01:01:54.580
You ready for another one?

1203
01:01:55.624 --> 01:01:56.930
Right now?

1204
01:01:57.061 --> 01:01:59.106
Yeah. this guy's
in town for one night.

1205
01:01:59.237 --> 01:02:01.282
He wanted something special.
right? He wants--

1206
01:02:01.413 --> 01:02:03.458
He wants the service
that costs eight grand.

1207
01:02:08.115 --> 01:02:11.902
So. after tonight I will
owe you $14.000 less.

1208
01:02:12.032 --> 01:02:13.817
I believe that
is the math. yeah.

1209
01:02:13.947 --> 01:02:14.818
Yes.

1210
01:02:18.256 --> 01:02:20.519
Right. Yeah.

1211
01:02:20.649 --> 01:02:23.348
I predict beautiful things.
personally.

1212
01:02:23.478 --> 01:02:26.264
I mean I think. I think you got
a hell of a season ahead of ya.

1213
01:02:34.925 --> 01:02:37.231
No. I'm not gonna tell you
where the chocolate chips are.

1214
01:02:37.362 --> 01:02:39.146
Because your mother will kill
me. that's why.

1215
01:02:39.277 --> 01:02:41.322
Okay. they're in the breadbox.
Oh. my gosh.

1216
01:02:41.453 --> 01:02:43.107
I can't believe I let that slip.

1217
01:02:43.237 --> 01:02:45.283
Okay. but only have ten though.
okay? Okay. I gotta go.

1218
01:02:45.413 --> 01:02:48.286
I love you. Okay. bye.
Uh. Fiona. sorry.

1219
01:02:48.416 --> 01:02:50.244
- It's okay.
- Uh. if you're Fiona...

1220
01:02:50.375 --> 01:02:52.725
- I am.
- Okay. I uh...

1221
01:02:52.856 --> 01:02:55.206
I thought I recognized you from
your... from your picture.

1222
01:02:56.381 --> 01:02:57.861
You're early.

1223
01:02:57.991 --> 01:02:59.514
I am.

1224
01:03:00.211 --> 01:03:01.516
Um... do you wanna come on up?

1225
01:03:01.647 --> 01:03:03.127
Okay.

1226
01:03:08.654 --> 01:03:10.003
Sorry about the awkward
meeting.

1227
01:03:10.134 --> 01:03:11.831
It's fine.

1228
01:03:11.962 --> 01:03:14.094
This is what you wear
in your downtime?

1229
01:03:14.225 --> 01:03:15.661
Yeah. I can go change.

1230
01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:18.142
No. No. I like you
dressed like this.

1231
01:03:18.272 --> 01:03:19.752
So. you're into punishment?

1232
01:03:20.884 --> 01:03:24.452
Actually I would uh. I would
prefer if you took charge.

1233
01:03:24.583 --> 01:03:26.585
You know I'm a sub. right?

1234
01:03:26.715 --> 01:03:28.935
That's what your ad
said. yeah.

1235
01:03:29.066 --> 01:03:31.068
But your photo on your website.
something about your face.

1236
01:03:31.198 --> 01:03:33.810
I thought you might make
an exception.

1237
01:03:37.465 --> 01:03:40.338
I have 175 employees.

1238
01:03:41.643 --> 01:03:46.518
I am the bossman all day.
every day. It's too much power.

1239
01:03:52.393 --> 01:03:54.004
This is about balance.

1240
01:03:55.309 --> 01:03:56.833
I need...

1241
01:03:58.617 --> 01:04:00.445
radical surrender.

1242
01:04:23.642 --> 01:04:25.600
See you tomorrow.
Uncle Bill.

1243
01:04:27.385 --> 01:04:28.386
Bye.

1244
01:04:30.083 --> 01:04:32.216
Uh. Ms. Claudia Drury?

1245
01:04:32.346 --> 01:04:33.608
Yeah?

1246
01:04:33.739 --> 01:04:35.001
I'm here to perform
a wellness check.

1247
01:04:35.132 --> 01:04:36.568
I'd like to come in
and have a look around.

1248
01:04:36.698 --> 01:04:38.396
Sure. yeah.

1249
01:04:38.526 --> 01:04:39.876
Make sure you're not in any
danger. alive and well.

1250
01:04:40.659 --> 01:04:42.008
Why?

1251
01:04:43.705 --> 01:04:48.101
I mean. how did you know I...
I was here? Who sent you?

1252
01:04:48.232 --> 01:04:51.409
A concerned citizen
came to our precinct.

1253
01:04:51.539 --> 01:04:53.150
Worried for your safety.

1254
01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:54.847
Was it my mom?

1255
01:04:54.978 --> 01:04:57.676
I can't tell you that but if
you're missing your mom.

1256
01:04:57.806 --> 01:05:01.854
maybe you should call her.
Or if you don't wanna call her.

1257
01:05:01.985 --> 01:05:03.987
then call me. Okay?

1258
01:05:05.379 --> 01:05:06.554
Sure.

1259
01:05:10.210 --> 01:05:11.516
Bye.

1260
01:05:13.039 --> 01:05:14.519
Bye.

1261
01:05:31.275 --> 01:05:34.060
It's not just this month.
Look at this year versus last.

1262
01:05:35.496 --> 01:05:38.630
All right. she's slacked off
before but what.

1263
01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:40.023
is she playing favorites here?

1264
01:05:40.153 --> 01:05:41.938
She giving discounts
or something?

1265
01:05:42.068 --> 01:05:46.333
Okay well. okay.
here's a guy. Yeah. oh my God.

1266
01:05:46.464 --> 01:05:48.379
He's been booking with her
three times a week

1267
01:05:48.509 --> 01:05:51.730
for the last six months.
Calls himself David.

1268
01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:53.514
And he's been one of her
clients since the beginning.

1269
01:05:53.645 --> 01:05:55.255
How much is she
charging David?

1270
01:05:55.386 --> 01:05:58.824
Three grand a pop. Everyone
else is doing six to nine.

1271
01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:00.957
In prime time. In prime time!

1272
01:06:01.087 --> 01:06:02.654
Yeah. and he's booking
overnights. too.

1273
01:06:02.784 --> 01:06:04.612
Oh. Overnight for three grand?

1274
01:06:04.743 --> 01:06:06.832
What. does he think he's her
boyfriend or something?

1275
01:06:08.051 --> 01:06:09.748
When's the next appointment?

1276
01:06:09.878 --> 01:06:12.881
I'm in heels.
I can't stand here all day.

1277
01:06:13.012 --> 01:06:15.014
He's ten minutes late.

1278
01:06:15.145 --> 01:06:17.495
Some boyfriend.
Has he canceled?

1279
01:06:19.453 --> 01:06:21.151
She's coming down
dressed to go out.

1280
01:06:22.065 --> 01:06:23.675
- Hi.
- Hey.

1281
01:06:23.805 --> 01:06:25.372
Oh. now. where...
where they...

1282
01:06:25.503 --> 01:06:27.026
what are they gonna do it in
the park?

1283
01:06:27.157 --> 01:06:28.680
Follow her.

1284
01:06:28.810 --> 01:06:30.377
Oh. my God. he's hugging her.

1285
01:06:30.508 --> 01:06:33.119
So. he... he's hot for her.

1286
01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:36.993
It's not what it looks like.
It looks like affection.

1287
01:06:37.123 --> 01:06:40.039
Ah. geez. Ah. geez.

1288
01:06:41.214 --> 01:06:43.564
What... what. Stay. I wanna hear
what they're saying.

1289
01:06:43.695 --> 01:06:44.870
You stay with them!

1290
01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:47.568
I brought you something.

1291
01:06:47.699 --> 01:06:49.440
When did you have
time to go shopping?

1292
01:06:49.570 --> 01:06:52.051
He's giving her a present
in a little box.

1293
01:06:52.182 --> 01:06:53.661
What. is he proposing now?

1294
01:06:53.792 --> 01:06:55.359
Hmm. it's a crane.

1295
01:06:55.489 --> 01:06:57.100
It's your spirit animal.

1296
01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:59.102
It'll watch over you.

1297
01:06:59.232 --> 01:07:00.886
God knows I need it.

1298
01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:04.672
You know what? Actually. can we
just change the subject?

1299
01:07:04.803 --> 01:07:07.980
- Yeah. to what?
- Lunch is always a safe option.

1300
01:07:08.111 --> 01:07:09.938
Lar...

1301
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:11.940
Oh God. that Larry
sounds bad. What?

1302
01:07:12.071 --> 01:07:14.639
It's worse. He's taking
her to lunch.

1303
01:07:14.769 --> 01:07:18.991
Are you... the L word?
You... lunch?

1304
01:07:29.915 --> 01:07:32.787
All right. This David guy.
is he your favorite?

1305
01:07:32.918 --> 01:07:34.224
What? No.

1306
01:07:34.354 --> 01:07:36.182
You're giving him
a discounted rate. Claud.

1307
01:07:36.313 --> 01:07:37.792
The numbers don't lie.

1308
01:07:37.923 --> 01:07:39.272
What's this?

1309
01:07:39.403 --> 01:07:41.013
That was just...
they're gifts.

1310
01:07:41.144 --> 01:07:42.971
They're just gifts from like
a stockbroker um... Ryan.

1311
01:07:43.102 --> 01:07:45.931
- What's in the box?
- They're just scissors.

1312
01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:50.283
Sci... scissors?
That's a stupid gift.

1313
01:07:50.414 --> 01:07:52.938
Stupid scissors
from stupid David?

1314
01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:54.940
Yeah. they're from David.

1315
01:07:58.030 --> 01:07:59.945
At least you're being honest.

1316
01:08:00.076 --> 01:08:03.035
Nothing gets by us.
You understand that.

1317
01:08:03.166 --> 01:08:04.602
Honesty is imperative.

1318
01:08:04.732 --> 01:08:07.257
I am always honest with
you. Larry. Always.

1319
01:08:07.387 --> 01:08:09.172
You're getting too close
to this David guy.

1320
01:08:10.347 --> 01:08:12.436
And he's not paying enough!

1321
01:08:12.566 --> 01:08:14.481
You talk to him about me?

1322
01:08:14.612 --> 01:08:17.702
No. I don't tell him anything
about you or my... I don't even.

1323
01:08:17.832 --> 01:08:20.705
he doesn't even know my real
name. okay? No one does.

1324
01:08:20.835 --> 01:08:23.925
You are gonna dump this guy.
You understand?

1325
01:08:24.056 --> 01:08:28.234
You are gonna dump him or I will
put his name on your webpage.

1326
01:08:28.365 --> 01:08:32.064
I will D-O-double...
I will dox him so hard.

1327
01:08:32.195 --> 01:08:33.631
No. You know what
I'm gonna do? I'm gonna...

1328
01:08:33.761 --> 01:08:35.415
I'm gonna go to the police.
That's what I'm gonna do.

1329
01:08:35.546 --> 01:08:37.722
- No. Larry. Larry!
- I'm going to the police.

1330
01:08:37.852 --> 01:08:40.899
I'm gonna tell 'em how you
poisoned me and my daughter.

1331
01:08:41.029 --> 01:08:42.944
What. Listen.
you know what I have?

1332
01:08:43.075 --> 01:08:46.209
I got a confession by you.
That's what I got!

1333
01:08:46.339 --> 01:08:47.862
No. I will dump him!
I will dump him!

1334
01:08:47.993 --> 01:08:49.821
- This may be on you.
- He means nothing to me.

1335
01:08:49.951 --> 01:08:52.128
He does not mean anything to me!
He means nothing to me!

1336
01:09:09.057 --> 01:09:10.972
- Oh. my God. Larry. please!
- I swear to God.

1337
01:09:11.103 --> 01:09:12.800
Please!

1338
01:09:12.931 --> 01:09:15.977
If you do not start telling
me the truth. I'm gonna...

1339
01:09:16.108 --> 01:09:17.457
Where the hell
are the burgers?

1340
01:09:17.588 --> 01:09:19.111
They'll be here in a minute.

1341
01:09:19.242 --> 01:09:21.722
Larry. I was just with him
because he loaned me money.

1342
01:09:21.853 --> 01:09:24.769
Just shut up!

1343
01:09:24.899 --> 01:09:27.598
I have pictures of you two
outside of your apartment. okay?

1344
01:09:27.728 --> 01:09:29.643
He wasn't on your schedule
for that time.

1345
01:09:29.774 --> 01:09:32.472
so stop lying. Claudia!
- All right! All right!

1346
01:09:32.603 --> 01:09:36.259
All right. I will tell you
the truth. The truth is that...

1347
01:09:36.389 --> 01:09:39.305
the truth is. is that I just
feel like you haven't been

1348
01:09:39.436 --> 01:09:41.873
paying enough attention to me.
And I missed you.

1349
01:09:42.003 --> 01:09:45.877
And I just... I wanted to make
you jealous or something.

1350
01:09:46.007 --> 01:09:47.574
And I wanted you to pay
attention to me.

1351
01:09:47.705 --> 01:09:49.272
- I was just using--
- Lies! Lies! Lies!

1352
01:09:49.402 --> 01:09:51.099
You are lying to me right now!
You're lying to me

1353
01:09:51.230 --> 01:09:52.927
and you're twisting logic.
- No!

1354
01:09:53.058 --> 01:09:54.538
You are. That's... I know
you've been feeding

1355
01:09:54.668 --> 01:09:55.669
your boyfriend bullshit
about me!

1356
01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:57.280
No. I wouldn't.

1357
01:09:57.410 --> 01:09:59.717
Why. why? You are. You're
trying to make me think

1358
01:09:59.847 --> 01:10:03.242
like I'm... what I'm like. some
kinda criminal or something.

1359
01:10:03.373 --> 01:10:06.637
Let me tell you this.
There's no way.

1360
01:10:06.767 --> 01:10:10.031
there's just no way. It's not
happening. You understand?

1361
01:10:10.162 --> 01:10:11.381
I'm not going back to jail!

1362
01:10:11.511 --> 01:10:14.558
I know.
I wouldn't want you to.

1363
01:10:16.516 --> 01:10:18.083
You gotta be taught a lesson.

1364
01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:19.650
That's it. You gotta be taught
a lesson.

1365
01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:22.522
No. No. no!
Larry. please. don't!

1366
01:10:24.742 --> 01:10:27.005
Did you tell this man you're
being held against your will?

1367
01:10:27.135 --> 01:10:28.441
- No!
- Huh?

1368
01:10:28.572 --> 01:10:31.009
Did you tell him
that you wanna give up sex work?

1369
01:10:31.139 --> 01:10:32.532
And run away with him? Huh?

1370
01:10:32.663 --> 01:10:33.968
- No!
- That what you said?

1371
01:10:34.099 --> 01:10:39.322
No! Larry. please.
I'm so cold.

1372
01:10:39.452 --> 01:10:42.542
Cold? This is nothing.

1373
01:10:42.673 --> 01:10:45.502
It's on medium.
I can turn it up if you want.

1374
01:10:45.632 --> 01:10:47.852
I don't wanna die.

1375
01:10:47.982 --> 01:10:49.680
You don't wanna die.

1376
01:10:51.072 --> 01:10:52.117
It's the food.

1377
01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:53.423
Go get it.

1378
01:10:58.645 --> 01:10:59.951
Quiet.

1379
01:11:02.649 --> 01:11:04.390
Quiet.

1380
01:11:04.521 --> 01:11:06.044
Should I be recording this?

1381
01:11:06.174 --> 01:11:07.872
Just the audio.

1382
01:11:09.090 --> 01:11:11.441
I'm gonna ask you one
more time.

1383
01:11:11.571 --> 01:11:17.534
Did you tell David that you were
gonna run away with him

1384
01:11:17.664 --> 01:11:19.579
and quit sex trade?

1385
01:11:19.710 --> 01:11:21.146
Did ya?

1386
01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:23.453
Did ya?!

1387
01:11:27.587 --> 01:11:28.806
No. No!

1388
01:11:32.679 --> 01:11:33.724
No.

1389
01:11:35.943 --> 01:11:38.946
- Larry.
- Sounds like she's snorting.

1390
01:11:41.993 --> 01:11:43.951
At least she got
the message. Huh?

1391
01:11:44.082 --> 01:11:46.214
Sure did.

1392
01:11:46.345 --> 01:11:48.739
No. No. Larry.

1393
01:11:48.869 --> 01:11:50.218
Hey.

1394
01:11:52.873 --> 01:11:55.006
What? Why the long face?

1395
01:11:57.225 --> 01:12:02.100
Um. Lar the... uh. last night
when you were with Claudia

1396
01:12:02.230 --> 01:12:04.407
there's a um...

1397
01:12:04.537 --> 01:12:06.452
What? Spit it out?

1398
01:12:06.583 --> 01:12:09.063
Um. there. I think we all got
the same email.

1399
01:12:09.194 --> 01:12:12.937
There's a reporter. He wants
us to go on record.

1400
01:12:13.067 --> 01:12:16.244
- For what?
- Well. it's unbelievable.

1401
01:12:16.375 --> 01:12:17.550
He's writing a story about
Sarah Lawrence

1402
01:12:17.681 --> 01:12:21.032
and Slonim Woods 9 and...
and you.

1403
01:12:22.207 --> 01:12:23.991
Me?

1404
01:12:24.122 --> 01:12:26.951
- Yeah.
- Why me?

1405
01:12:27.081 --> 01:12:30.084
Well. maybe he wants to dig up
some negative story about you.

1406
01:12:30.215 --> 01:12:32.391
- And all of us.
- Negative story?

1407
01:12:32.522 --> 01:12:35.351
On what? Huh?

1408
01:12:35.481 --> 01:12:37.527
Why. how I helped
you all with your mental health?

1409
01:12:39.224 --> 01:12:41.705
Gave ya... gave ya free room
and board?

1410
01:12:41.835 --> 01:12:43.228
Get back up there. will ya?

1411
01:12:47.275 --> 01:12:50.975
What they do? They find the...
the gun I held to your head?

1412
01:12:51.105 --> 01:12:52.977
Huh? Did they dredge
the East River?

1413
01:12:53.107 --> 01:12:55.980
Find the gun I threw in there?
Huh.

1414
01:12:57.982 --> 01:13:00.419
Give me the phone. Let me call
this guy. What is it?

1415
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:02.378
Dad. are you sure
that's a good idea?

1416
01:13:04.205 --> 01:13:06.773
No. I'm not sure. You dial it
and put it next to my face.

1417
01:13:06.904 --> 01:13:10.342
This guy. Who is it?

1418
01:13:11.735 --> 01:13:13.563
What's his name?

1419
01:13:13.693 --> 01:13:15.565
What's this liar's name?

1420
01:13:18.132 --> 01:13:19.612
Fiona.

1421
01:13:20.091 --> 01:13:22.180
Fiona. can we talk? Please?

1422
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:24.878
You can't be near me. David.
People might be watching us.

1423
01:13:25.009 --> 01:13:26.880
Okay. I just. I haven't heard
from you in a week

1424
01:13:27.011 --> 01:13:29.709
and I just can't shake this.
This sickening feeling that...

1425
01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:31.668
that you're not doing this work
of your own free will.

1426
01:13:32.843 --> 01:13:34.322
Are you being sex trafficked.

1427
01:13:34.453 --> 01:13:37.630
What? No. Of course not.
I just... I owe someone

1428
01:13:37.761 --> 01:13:40.328
a lot of money and we're getting
too close

1429
01:13:40.459 --> 01:13:42.418
and it's distracting
me from paying off my debts.

1430
01:13:42.548 --> 01:13:44.420
If you owe someone money
and the person is forcing you

1431
01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:47.335
in the sex trade. that is the
definition of sex trafficking.

1432
01:13:47.466 --> 01:13:51.035
Come with me. right now.
No packing. no hesitating.

1433
01:13:51.165 --> 01:13:53.080
just come with me to Hartford.
I will put you up somewhere.

1434
01:13:53.211 --> 01:13:54.995
You can hide and be safe.
I will help you get help.

1435
01:13:55.126 --> 01:13:57.911
David. I can't go
anywhere. okay?

1436
01:13:58.042 --> 01:13:59.565
This man. he has things on me

1437
01:13:59.696 --> 01:14:02.176
and he'll either send me
to jail or he'll kill me.

1438
01:14:02.307 --> 01:14:04.265
And he's threatened to tell
your family about us.

1439
01:14:04.396 --> 01:14:06.093
so just go back to your family.

1440
01:14:06.224 --> 01:14:10.010
Go back and leave me
and all of this behind you.

1441
01:14:10.141 --> 01:14:13.753
Okay. Fiona. hey. I will...
I will deal with my crap.

1442
01:14:13.884 --> 01:14:16.060
Let me help you. Fiona.

1443
01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:23.459
My name is Claudia.

1444
01:14:26.157 --> 01:14:30.030
Claudia. Wow. it suits you.

1445
01:14:31.118 --> 01:14:34.252
Come with me. Okay?
This can all be over.

1446
01:14:34.382 --> 01:14:35.819
Just no strings attached.

1447
01:14:41.085 --> 01:14:43.783
Total shit job.

1448
01:14:43.914 --> 01:14:46.699
Not to mention screaming
bullshit.

1449
01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:48.527
Okay. listen to this.

1450
01:14:48.658 --> 01:14:51.138
"Mr. Ray exerted
cult-like control

1451
01:14:51.269 --> 01:14:53.445
over his students' lives.

1452
01:14:53.576 --> 01:14:55.882
He repeated stories
of sexual domination.

1453
01:14:56.013 --> 01:14:58.581
And of his emotionally
unstable charges."

1454
01:14:58.711 --> 01:15:00.974
Oh. fancy word for you.

1455
01:15:01.105 --> 01:15:05.239
"Ray himself freely admitted
to accepting money from Claudia

1456
01:15:05.370 --> 01:15:08.678
while she was working as a...
as a prostitute."

1457
01:15:08.808 --> 01:15:10.418
Sex worker. you...

1458
01:15:10.549 --> 01:15:11.985
Oh. my God.

1459
01:15:14.248 --> 01:15:17.948
Nothing sells like
white kids in peril. right?

1460
01:15:19.427 --> 01:15:21.821
I mean. all the. all the
reporters. boy.

1461
01:15:21.952 --> 01:15:23.823
they're gonna sink their teeth
into this thing right here.

1462
01:15:23.954 --> 01:15:25.695
which is why we gotta
stop Claudia

1463
01:15:25.825 --> 01:15:28.349
from adding to this shit show
right now.

1464
01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:31.962
Lar. did you admit that
Claudia gave you money?

1465
01:15:32.092 --> 01:15:33.398
Yeah. so what?

1466
01:15:36.009 --> 01:15:38.490
So what? So what?
Is it a crime to...

1467
01:15:38.621 --> 01:15:40.536
to accept recompense from
someone who owes you money?

1468
01:15:40.666 --> 01:15:43.060
- Please!
- But Larry...

1469
01:15:43.190 --> 01:15:45.497
it might be a crime.

1470
01:15:45.628 --> 01:15:49.501
Might be a crime.
She. she poisoned me.

1471
01:15:49.632 --> 01:15:51.590
She... I have... she
confessed to it on tape.

1472
01:15:51.721 --> 01:15:54.245
Come on! She owes.
she owes me...

1473
01:15:54.375 --> 01:15:55.507
why am I even telling you any
of this?

1474
01:15:55.638 --> 01:15:57.117
Will you do me a favor

1475
01:15:57.248 --> 01:15:58.989
and get your coats so we can go
see her right now?

1476
01:15:59.119 --> 01:16:02.296
Okay. well obviously Dan
talked to them

1477
01:16:02.427 --> 01:16:04.037
and Santos didn't.

1478
01:16:04.168 --> 01:16:07.780
But it's really damning.
I mean. that's good. right?

1479
01:16:07.911 --> 01:16:11.175
I mean... everybody
I've ever known. like.

1480
01:16:11.305 --> 01:16:14.570
millions of people.
are going to read this.

1481
01:16:33.545 --> 01:16:36.374
Hi. Can I uh. can I help you?

1482
01:16:36.504 --> 01:16:39.029
You must be David.
David Wells?

1483
01:16:39.159 --> 01:16:40.900
Yeah. yeah. that's me.

1484
01:16:41.031 --> 01:16:42.989
We're trying to track
down Claudia Drury.

1485
01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:44.904
Who?

1486
01:16:45.035 --> 01:16:48.038
We have CCTV footage of the
Eden Park Hotel lobby

1487
01:16:48.168 --> 01:16:50.823
in New York City. where you and
Claudia were talking

1488
01:16:50.954 --> 01:16:53.304
about a week ago.
I can assure you.

1489
01:16:53.434 --> 01:16:55.306
she's not in any trouble.
Either are you.

1490
01:16:55.436 --> 01:16:57.351
Uh yeah. I just. I don't...

1491
01:16:57.482 --> 01:16:59.440
I don't know where she is.
so I'm sorry.

1492
01:16:59.571 --> 01:17:01.660
I'm the lead investigator in
the sex trafficking department

1493
01:17:01.791 --> 01:17:03.314
at the FBI.

1494
01:17:03.444 --> 01:17:06.143
I'm trying to fast-track
the arrest of Larry Ray.

1495
01:17:08.406 --> 01:17:10.147
Yeah. um. come in.

1496
01:17:15.631 --> 01:17:17.328
Claudia?

1497
01:17:18.329 --> 01:17:20.461
I'm Agent Maguire.

1498
01:17:20.592 --> 01:17:22.638
I'm heading up an investigation
into Larry Ray.

1499
01:17:25.249 --> 01:17:29.557
I have reason to believe he's
guilty of over 15 felony charges

1500
01:17:29.688 --> 01:17:33.387
and I'm really hoping you might
talk to me about his activities.

1501
01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:40.090
From what I'm learning. Larry
coerced you. exploited you.

1502
01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:42.788
trafficked you.
all for his own gain.

1503
01:17:43.702 --> 01:17:46.444
Claudia. my forensic
analysts told me

1504
01:17:46.574 --> 01:17:48.446
that in a four-year period.

1505
01:17:48.576 --> 01:17:51.275
you paid him over
two million dollars.

1506
01:17:52.363 --> 01:17:54.104
Did you know that?

1507
01:17:58.238 --> 01:18:00.284
Could you come out and
talk to me. Claudia. please?

1508
01:18:00.414 --> 01:18:02.939
Just a chat. I promise.

1509
01:18:04.157 --> 01:18:06.072
No.

1510
01:18:06.203 --> 01:18:09.119
No! No!

1511
01:18:09.249 --> 01:18:13.863
Okay. Maybe you're not ready.
I get that.

1512
01:18:15.821 --> 01:18:18.563
But Claudia.
Larry is still out there.

1513
01:18:18.694 --> 01:18:21.522
He's living with two
of your friends

1514
01:18:21.653 --> 01:18:25.831
and he needs to be stopped. You
know that even more than I do.

1515
01:18:25.962 --> 01:18:28.878
I'm just... he'll kill me.

1516
01:18:30.401 --> 01:18:33.839
He will torture and kill me.

1517
01:18:33.970 --> 01:18:35.449
We won't let him do that.

1518
01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:37.060
You don't know him.

1519
01:18:39.149 --> 01:18:45.285
And the things that I've done
will come out

1520
01:18:45.416 --> 01:18:47.418
and I just...

1521
01:18:47.548 --> 01:18:51.901
I just want...
I just want to disappear.

1522
01:18:53.772 --> 01:18:55.600
So. please go!

1523
01:18:56.601 --> 01:18:59.735
Okay. I will.

1524
01:19:01.649 --> 01:19:05.871
But Claudia.
you are the victim here.

1525
01:19:06.002 --> 01:19:10.920
And the FBI knows that. So. I
will leave my card with David.

1526
01:19:11.050 --> 01:19:12.835
But please. if you have a change
of heart.

1527
01:19:12.965 --> 01:19:15.620
time is of the essence.
Thank you.

1528
01:19:24.977 --> 01:19:26.587
- Claudia?
- Sorry.

1529
01:19:26.718 --> 01:19:30.940
Claudia. you here? Honey?
You in the uh... powder room?

1530
01:19:32.332 --> 01:19:34.857
It's dead. Clearly she
doesn't have her phone.

1531
01:19:34.987 --> 01:19:36.772
Wherever she is.

1532
01:19:38.121 --> 01:19:40.210
Tomorrow she's scheduled
to check out. What a shame.

1533
01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:43.213
Really. That's... I didn't
know about that.

1534
01:19:43.343 --> 01:19:46.564
May I ask. can you clear out
her belongings by then?

1535
01:19:46.694 --> 01:19:49.480
Actually. you know what?
How about immediately?

1536
01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:02.101
You read the expose?

1537
01:20:02.232 --> 01:20:04.625
It made me physically sick.

1538
01:20:05.626 --> 01:20:07.715
Do you have enough to take him
down now?

1539
01:20:07.846 --> 01:20:09.761
Not by a long shot.

1540
01:20:10.936 --> 01:20:12.503
That's why we called you in.

1541
01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:17.421
Claudia won't go on the record.
Won't talk to the FBI.

1542
01:20:17.551 --> 01:20:18.770
That's because this filth
of a man

1543
01:20:18.901 --> 01:20:20.859
still has control over her.

1544
01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:24.820
Not anymore. She's left him.
She's gone into hiding.

1545
01:20:31.174 --> 01:20:32.436
She got away.

1546
01:20:32.566 --> 01:20:34.220
Yes.

1547
01:20:34.351 --> 01:20:36.919
Why hasn't she called me?

1548
01:20:38.616 --> 01:20:42.925
She is deeply. deeply ashamed
of what she's been through.

1549
01:20:43.055 --> 01:20:45.405
And she's terrified of him.

1550
01:20:45.536 --> 01:20:48.495
But if you can help convince her
that we can keep her safe

1551
01:20:48.626 --> 01:20:50.976
and that she has nothing to be
ashamed of--

1552
01:20:51.107 --> 01:20:52.543
Why would she listen to me?

1553
01:20:54.762 --> 01:20:56.329
We've gotta try everything
we can.

1554
01:21:03.902 --> 01:21:06.122
- Yes?
- Hi. um I'm Christian Drury.

1555
01:21:06.252 --> 01:21:08.602
Claudia Drury's mother
and this is her father.

1556
01:21:08.733 --> 01:21:12.128
We were hoping to talk to her?

1557
01:21:13.477 --> 01:21:15.305
Um. yeah. Yeah.

1558
01:21:19.091 --> 01:21:20.223
Thank you.

1559
01:21:28.231 --> 01:21:30.233
Oh baby. we missed
you so much.

1560
01:21:31.799 --> 01:21:35.281
The FBI just wants to talk
you into testifying.

1561
01:21:35.412 --> 01:21:37.675
- That's why you're here.
- Oh. sweetie.

1562
01:21:37.805 --> 01:21:42.245
If he gets locked up. he can
never hurt you or anybody else.

1563
01:21:43.376 --> 01:21:44.595
That's right.

1564
01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:51.602
Whatever happened to you. you
are not a criminal. You are--

1565
01:21:51.732 --> 01:21:53.430
- Yes. I am!
- No. you are not.

1566
01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:55.214
Yeah. I am!

1567
01:21:55.345 --> 01:21:58.348
No. No. You are the victim.

1568
01:21:58.478 --> 01:22:02.961
And meeting Larry Ray was just
a sick twist of fate.

1569
01:22:04.963 --> 01:22:06.660
It was just an accident.

1570
01:22:06.791 --> 01:22:11.187
No. No. it wasn't.
Larry was right.

1571
01:22:11.317 --> 01:22:13.406
About what. sweetie?

1572
01:22:13.537 --> 01:22:18.629
He's right about accidents.
That... that there aren't any.

1573
01:22:18.759 --> 01:22:20.674
Like. he didn't put any bars
on those windows.

1574
01:22:20.805 --> 01:22:22.850
- I was the one who did it.
- No.

1575
01:22:22.981 --> 01:22:26.115
I did all those things.
It was me. It was me.

1576
01:22:26.245 --> 01:22:27.768
No. Claudia. no.

1577
01:22:29.596 --> 01:22:34.210
Do you think that even if I
did it. I could still undo it?

1578
01:22:36.299 --> 01:22:37.735
Yeah.

1579
01:22:37.865 --> 01:22:40.346
Even if he's...

1580
01:22:40.477 --> 01:22:43.959
if he can't hurt me.
then I still have to testify.

1581
01:22:44.089 --> 01:22:48.137
I still have to say all those
things. My journals.

1582
01:22:48.267 --> 01:22:50.313
They're gonna... they're gonna
read my journals out.

1583
01:22:50.443 --> 01:22:52.141
Sweetie.

1584
01:22:52.271 --> 01:22:54.882
His lawyers will read them
and then everyone will know

1585
01:22:55.013 --> 01:22:56.493
the kind of person I am.

1586
01:22:56.623 --> 01:22:58.277
It's okay.

1587
01:22:58.408 --> 01:23:01.454
I don't know if I can do it.

1588
01:23:32.398 --> 01:23:36.707
Who is ready
for crepes a la Ray?

1589
01:23:39.318 --> 01:23:41.625
You know they're special when
they're savory. right?

1590
01:23:41.755 --> 01:23:45.672
But you know they're extra
special. extra. extra Ray

1591
01:23:45.803 --> 01:23:50.199
when savory means caviar.

1592
01:23:50.329 --> 01:23:53.376
What... the heck is that?

1593
01:23:53.506 --> 01:23:56.596
It's for the best for my loyal
customers. that's why.

1594
01:23:56.727 --> 01:24:01.427
But Dan. and Santos
and Claudia. well that was...

1595
01:24:01.558 --> 01:24:02.820
I wonder what they're
having for breakfast right now?

1596
01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:04.343
That's. that's what I wonder.

1597
01:24:04.474 --> 01:24:07.868
Well. Claudia. I don't know.
Maybe Talia knows?

1598
01:24:07.999 --> 01:24:11.611
Tal... Talia is with her
grandfather in North Carolina.

1599
01:24:11.742 --> 01:24:14.832
And Santos is finishing
school and Dan.

1600
01:24:14.962 --> 01:24:17.356
I... I don't know. I think
he's writing something.

1601
01:24:18.836 --> 01:24:20.794
You know what I was thinking?
I think we should get a cat.

1602
01:24:20.925 --> 01:24:22.927
FBI. open the door!

1603
01:24:23.058 --> 01:24:24.537
- Larry?
- Don't open that door.

1604
01:24:24.668 --> 01:24:27.105
Don't you open that door.

1605
01:24:27.236 --> 01:24:29.325
- Larry!
- Let them pound. Go ahead.

1606
01:24:29.455 --> 01:24:31.501
You run you little chickens.

1607
01:24:31.631 --> 01:24:33.590
You go ahead.

1608
01:24:39.074 --> 01:24:40.945
Crepes a la Ray.

1609
01:25:36.392 --> 01:25:39.438
Subtitling: difuze
