Leo is at my dad's house in Palm Springs. I just dropped him off.

3
00:02:29.366 --> 00:02:30.672
Why did you do this?

4
00:02:34.937 --> 00:02:36.504
I just wanted to see him.

5
00:02:43.337 --> 00:02:44.903

Yeah. Uh. hi. I'm looking
for Mr. Garcia-Marquez.

9
00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:16.343
Charlie Bond.

10

Okay. Yeah. Could you please
just let him know
that I-- I have the item

11
00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:25.482

00:04:27.354 --> 00:04:29.138
That's great.
Thank you. Thank you.

Yes. And if-- if I could.

00:05:07.394 --> 00:05:11.049

Thank you.

20
00:07:11.866 --> 00:07:14.608
-Got your punk ass.
-Come on. guys.

21
00:07:14.912 --> 00:07:17.045
-Trying to get away. huh?
- What're you gonna
say now. punk?

22
00:07:17.088 --> 00:07:19.351
-Where's my money. bitch?
-I don't have it.

23
00:07:19.395 --> 00:07:21.919
-You told me that last week.
-I don't owe you guys anything.

24
00:07:21.963 --> 00:07:25.532
You owe me money.
We made a bet and you lost.
Pay up.

25
00:07:25.575 --> 00:07:27.708
-I don't have any money.
-Get his phone.

26
00:07:27.751 --> 00:07:29.449
-Phone is mine. bitch.
-Stop it.

27
00:07:29.492 --> 00:07:30.972
-Where's your phone?
-I'm tired of waiting for you.

28
00:07:31.015 --> 00:07:33.627
-You lost the bet. Pay up now.
-Get off me!

29
00:07:34.366 --> 00:07:36.673
-Pay up or you're dead.
-Hey! Hey. hey.

30
00:07:37.805 --> 00:07:38.849
Are you okay?

31
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.808
What's the problem?

32
00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:43.506
All right.

33
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.247
Lucky his daddy saved him.

34
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.249
Yeah. lucky. Get out of here.

35
00:07:51.079 --> 00:07:52.472
Hey. you okay?

36
00:07:54.517 --> 00:07:55.475
Whatever.

37
00:07:59.566 --> 00:08:02.133
Leo. hold up.
Let me give you a ride.

38
00:08:02.786 --> 00:08:04.266
I don't want to go with you.

39
00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:06.442
Oh. really?

40
00:08:07.269 --> 00:08:08.792
You wanna go with them?

41
00:08:10.968 --> 00:08:12.492
Does Mom even know you're here?

42
00:08:13.275 --> 00:08:14.581
Of course she does.

43
00:08:17.453 --> 00:08:18.585
Let's go.

44
00:08:19.194 --> 00:08:20.195
Come on.

45
00:08:27.028 --> 00:08:29.073
- What was that about?
- Nothing.

46
00:08:30.118 --> 00:08:31.423
Didn't look like nothing.

47
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.037
I'm fine. Okay?

48
00:09:06.763 --> 00:09:08.199
Why are you here. anyway?

49
00:09:10.898 --> 00:09:12.334
Sound disappointed.

50
00:09:12.769 --> 00:09:14.292
I just saved your ass.

51
00:09:17.295 --> 00:09:19.994
I was in the area.
I thought it would be fun
if I picked you up.

52
00:09:20.037 --> 00:09:21.343
Yeah. wow.

53
00:09:24.476 --> 00:09:27.349
You gonna tell me what happened?
They were gonna beat you up.

54
00:09:27.392 --> 00:09:29.960
-I could've handled it.
-Oh. really?

55
00:09:31.353 --> 00:09:33.529
You don't wanna get caught up
in that kind of thing.
All right?

56
00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:35.749
Trust me.
It'll do you no good.

57
00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.229
What do you mean.
"It'll do you no good"?

58
00:09:38.273 --> 00:09:40.014
You don't even know
what happened.

59
00:09:42.451 --> 00:09:43.539
Tell me then.

60
00:09:47.412 --> 00:09:48.544
I lost a bet.

61
00:09:49.632 --> 00:09:50.894
Now I owe him money.

62
00:09:52.069 --> 00:09:54.115
-Okay. How much?
-Three hundred.

63
00:09:54.681 --> 00:09:57.335
-Three hundred dollars?
-Whatever.

64
00:09:58.206 --> 00:09:59.599
What were you betting on?

65
00:10:03.559 --> 00:10:04.821
Baseball.

66
00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:11.872
-That was Mom's street.
-I know. I just gotta make
a quick stop.

67
00:10:21.185 --> 00:10:22.273
Anton?

68
00:10:22.839 --> 00:10:23.710
Yes?

69
00:10:39.769 --> 00:10:41.684
Hey. Charlie.
You're up late.

70
00:10:41.728 --> 00:10:44.426
-Wouldn't miss this.
Sold out yet?
-It's looking good.

71
00:10:54.262 --> 00:10:55.480
Shut the door.

72
00:10:57.352 --> 00:10:58.527
So. it came in?

73
00:10:59.571 --> 00:11:00.616
Sure did.

74
00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:02.705
"The Eclipse."

75
00:11:03.227 --> 00:11:05.795
I thought
it was the "Mondschein."

76
00:11:05.839 --> 00:11:08.319
That's what
the Nazis called it
after they stole it.

77
00:11:08.798 --> 00:11:10.713
That's what
I'm going to call it.

78
00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:14.064
- You got a buyer yet?
-Perhaps.

79
00:11:15.196 --> 00:11:18.286
You know. Anton.
if you wait two more years.
it's gonna be worth double.

80
00:11:18.329 --> 00:11:21.506
Would you wait two years
for your commission?

81
00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:23.291
You are ethically challenged.
my friend.

82
00:11:23.334 --> 00:11:26.424
And you are
financially challenged.
my friend.

83
00:11:26.468 --> 00:11:28.688
That is because
of the people I work with.

84
00:11:28.731 --> 00:11:30.907
Speaking of which.
do you have my commission
for the Rivas painting?

85
00:11:30.951 --> 00:11:32.256
Call me tomorrow.

86
00:11:33.301 --> 00:11:36.391
Um. Larry Greenburg. please.

87
00:11:39.002 --> 00:11:40.003
Yes.

88
00:11:46.793 --> 00:11:49.578
Do me a favor. all right?
See that gallery down there?

89
00:11:50.797 --> 00:11:53.103
It's closed now.
But there's a guy inside.
His name is Anton.

90
00:11:53.147 --> 00:11:54.714
He's got a check for me.

91
00:11:56.628 --> 00:11:57.586
So?

92
00:11:58.761 --> 00:12:00.328
So. just knock
on the door and get it.

93
00:12:00.371 --> 00:12:01.982
Why do I have to get it?

94
00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:05.463
Because. Just do it. okay?
I need the check.

95
00:12:06.334 --> 00:12:08.858
-You get it yourself.
-I get it. you get it.

96
00:12:08.902 --> 00:12:11.121
What does it matter?
Why are you giving me
a hard time. Leo?

97
00:12:11.643 --> 00:12:13.428
It's payment for your mom.

98
00:12:18.825 --> 00:12:20.043
You're a jerk.

99
00:12:55.383 --> 00:12:56.776
We are closed.

100
00:12:57.559 --> 00:12:59.213
You have a check for my dad.

101
00:12:59.866 --> 00:13:01.737
- Who are you?
-Leo Jackson.

102
00:13:02.172 --> 00:13:03.695
-Who?
-Leo Jackson.

103
00:13:03.739 --> 00:13:05.741
I'm Charlie Bond's son.

104
00:13:07.221 --> 00:13:08.091
Really?

105
00:13:26.631 --> 00:13:28.329
Why can't you just
give me the check?

106
00:13:36.119 --> 00:13:38.295
Because I don't know you.

107
00:13:42.734 --> 00:13:45.781
-Get out of here. punk.
-Hey. No. wait up.

108
00:13:55.965 --> 00:13:57.184
Come on. let's go!

109
00:13:59.316 --> 00:14:01.884
-That guy is a jerk.
-Yeah. Did you get the check?

110
00:14:01.928 --> 00:14:04.582
-No. He said get it yourself.
-Okay. That's fine.
I'll do that.

111
00:14:04.626 --> 00:14:07.107
-All right. let's go.
-What about your check?

112
00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:09.239
I'll get it tomorrow.
Come on. let's go.
You hungry?

113
00:14:09.283 --> 00:14:11.328
-So. you're not gonna get it?
-No.

114
00:14:11.372 --> 00:14:13.983
I will get it later.
You hungry? Let's get
something to eat.

115
00:14:14.636 --> 00:14:15.506
Yeah.

116
00:14:35.962 --> 00:14:37.224
It's good to see you.

117
00:14:38.225 --> 00:14:39.791
It means a lot to me.

118
00:14:41.793 --> 00:14:43.317
I know it's been a while.

119
00:14:44.144 --> 00:14:46.581
Something's happened.
nothing to do with you.

120
00:14:48.278 --> 00:14:49.801
And I've got to deal with it.

121
00:14:52.674 --> 00:14:53.718
What happened?

122
00:15:18.743 --> 00:15:20.093
What are you doing here?

123
00:15:20.136 --> 00:15:21.572
Can I come in?

124
00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.010
No. you can't.

125
00:15:24.967 --> 00:15:26.969
Please. We need to talk.

126
00:15:27.883 --> 00:15:29.450
This is important.

127
00:15:29.493 --> 00:15:31.408
If you needed to talk.
why didn't you call?

128
00:15:31.452 --> 00:15:35.586
I was going to. but I thought
that we should speak in person.

129
00:16:09.316 --> 00:16:10.404
Where's the opener?

130
00:16:11.492 --> 00:16:13.146
Nope. We're not doing that.

131
00:16:13.494 --> 00:16:14.495
Hey.

132
00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:20.283
What do you want?

133
00:16:24.679 --> 00:16:26.724
I'd like to take Leo
for the weekend.

134
00:16:29.423 --> 00:16:30.337
Really?

135
00:16:32.339 --> 00:16:34.994
-Well. that's not gonna happen.
-He's my son too.

136
00:16:35.037 --> 00:16:38.171
What are you talking about?
You haven't seen him in a year.

137
00:16:38.214 --> 00:16:41.348
Yeah. well. I had my reasons.
I don't expect you
to believe me.

138
00:16:41.391 --> 00:16:42.958
But I'm sorry.

139
00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:44.438
Are you sorry
for not making your payments?

140
00:16:46.918 --> 00:16:50.313
You're a fucking piece of work.
You think you can just
walk in and out of his life.

141
00:16:50.357 --> 00:16:52.272
because you have a moment.

142
00:16:53.534 --> 00:16:54.448
Come on.

143
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:57.538
Let me take him for a few days.

144
00:17:02.195 --> 00:17:04.588
We had this conversation
in court.

145
00:17:04.632 --> 00:17:06.068
I'd like you to leave.

146
00:17:08.766 --> 00:17:10.333
-Oh. really?
-Really.

147
00:17:13.815 --> 00:17:15.164
This isn't about us.

148
00:17:15.904 --> 00:17:18.211
You can hate me all you want.
That's fine.

149
00:17:18.254 --> 00:17:20.082
Maybe I deserved it.
maybe I didn't.

150
00:17:20.126 --> 00:17:23.781
This is about him.
this is about him!
This is about his future!

151
00:17:23.825 --> 00:17:27.089
Oh. his future?
You're not in his future.

152
00:17:27.133 --> 00:17:29.570
-You didn't want this family.
-This is bullshit.

153
00:17:29.613 --> 00:17:31.963
And you're not gonna keep me
from seeing my son!

154
00:17:32.007 --> 00:17:33.269
Watch me.

155
00:17:33.313 --> 00:17:35.402
-Hey. stop.
-Don't touch me!

156
00:17:37.882 --> 00:17:38.840
Get out.

157
00:17:39.406 --> 00:17:40.450
Get out!

158
00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:07.695
That's me.

159
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.827
Leave it. Leave it.

160
00:18:10.524 --> 00:18:11.394
Leo.

161
00:18:12.395 --> 00:18:14.136
-Don't answer.
-It's Mom.

162
00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:15.181
-Yeah. Don't answer.
-Mom.

163
00:18:15.224 --> 00:18:16.138
Give me that.

164
00:18:21.883 --> 00:18:22.753
Shit!

165
00:18:24.581 --> 00:18:25.669
Hello?

166
00:18:25.713 --> 00:18:27.541
Dammit. What are you doing?

167
00:18:27.584 --> 00:18:28.890
Sof. what?

168
00:18:28.933 --> 00:18:31.110
Charlie. what's going on?
Where are you?

169
00:18:31.545 --> 00:18:33.634
We're just having
a hamburger. okay?
It's all good.

170
00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:37.507
Put Leo on the phone.
Put him on the phone.

171
00:18:37.551 --> 00:18:39.248
-You can talk to him--
-I want to talk to Mom.

172
00:18:39.292 --> 00:18:41.032
-You can talk to him later.
-I want to talk to Mom!

173
00:18:41.076 --> 00:18:43.122
Listen. we're just spending
a little time together.

174
00:18:43.165 --> 00:18:45.211
No. you're not.
You're bringing him
home right now.

175
00:18:45.254 --> 00:18:46.212
Shut up.

176
00:18:47.648 --> 00:18:49.650
-My phone. That was mine.
-I will buy you a new one.

177
00:18:49.693 --> 00:18:51.739
-Turn back now.

178
00:19:01.749 --> 00:19:03.011
I'm gonna get my phone.

179
00:19:03.925 --> 00:19:05.056
Stop it.

180
00:19:06.493 --> 00:19:08.016
-Leo.
-What?

181
00:19:09.191 --> 00:19:10.714
Just help me out here. okay?

182
00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:17.417
License and registration.

183
00:19:17.721 --> 00:19:19.114
Uh. yeah.

184
00:19:20.898 --> 00:19:23.597
-Here. That's everything.
-Do you know why
I stopped you. sir?

185
00:19:24.337 --> 00:19:26.643
No. Officer.

186
00:19:26.687 --> 00:19:28.341
You swerved into oncoming
traffic back there.
almost caused an accident.

187
00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:32.040
Yeah. I'm sorry.
We had a situation
with the food.

188
00:19:34.085 --> 00:19:35.391
You okay?

189
00:19:35.435 --> 00:19:36.871
Looks like you got
in a mess there.

190
00:19:37.524 --> 00:19:39.134
I couldn't help it.

191
00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:41.223
My dad punched me in the throat
when I wasn't looking.

192
00:19:43.704 --> 00:19:45.009
Is that a joke. son?

193
00:19:46.272 --> 00:19:47.664
Is your face a joke?

194
00:19:51.929 --> 00:19:52.974
Wait here.

195
00:19:57.152 --> 00:19:58.197
What are you doing?

196
00:19:58.849 --> 00:20:00.416
You ruined my favorite pants.

197
00:20:03.898 --> 00:20:05.291
Don't say anything else. okay?

198
00:20:25.006 --> 00:20:27.226
Ever hear the saying
"clothes make the man"?

199
00:20:28.314 --> 00:20:29.228
What about these?

200
00:20:30.141 --> 00:20:31.360
Are those for bingo night?

201
00:20:32.056 --> 00:20:34.276
Well... not for nothing.

202
00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:37.366
I do know
a thing or two about trends.
It is what I do for a living.

203
00:20:39.847 --> 00:20:43.416
-So what do you do for a living?
-I'm an art dealer.

204
00:20:43.459 --> 00:20:46.636
I find struggling artists.
and I make them successful.

205
00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.159
How do you do that?

206
00:20:49.073 --> 00:20:51.902
Well... people listen to me.

207
00:20:51.946 --> 00:20:54.383
I can tell if a painting
has something to say.

208
00:20:54.427 --> 00:20:55.732
if it's relevant or not.

209
00:20:55.776 --> 00:20:58.300
It's a skill.
and people pay me for it.

210
00:20:58.344 --> 00:21:00.781
How do you tell
if something has value?

211
00:21:01.216 --> 00:21:02.391
It's a feeling.

212
00:21:03.871 --> 00:21:05.481
And if you don't feel it.
that means it's worthless?

213
00:21:07.744 --> 00:21:09.050
I could be wrong.

214
00:21:11.922 --> 00:21:15.883
Mom said you tried to be
a painter. but your art
was too shitty to sell.

215
00:21:15.926 --> 00:21:17.667
And you never got over it.

216
00:21:18.538 --> 00:21:19.756
She would say that.

217
00:21:25.414 --> 00:21:26.850
No way.

218
00:21:37.992 --> 00:21:39.036
Charlie?

219
00:21:45.739 --> 00:21:46.783
You're kidding. right?

220
00:21:47.175 --> 00:21:48.524
You would never wear that.

221
00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:50.134
Wanna bet?

222
00:22:07.543 --> 00:22:08.718
Where's my money?

223
00:22:11.242 --> 00:22:12.461
Do you want to double up?

224
00:22:13.854 --> 00:22:14.855
Sure.

225
00:22:14.898 --> 00:22:16.160
-Okay.
-What's the bet?

226
00:22:19.033 --> 00:22:21.252
I bet you can't spend
the whole day with me.

227
00:22:24.908 --> 00:22:26.083
I can't do that.

228
00:22:26.823 --> 00:22:28.172
Mom would never let me.

229
00:22:30.436 --> 00:22:31.393
Wanna triple it?

230
00:22:34.004 --> 00:22:36.267
-Three hundred?
-Mm-hmm. that's right.

231
00:22:43.449 --> 00:22:44.493
What are we doing?

232
00:22:45.799 --> 00:22:47.975
-Just a little trip.
-Where to?

233
00:22:49.193 --> 00:22:50.673
You'll know
when we get there.

234
00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.443
Good evening.
How can I help you?

235
00:23:21.487 --> 00:23:23.358
Uh. we would like a room
for the night.

236
00:23:28.319 --> 00:23:30.234
This place
has not changed a bit.

237
00:23:30.887 --> 00:23:33.934
I haven't been here since
I was a kid. Maybe a couple
years younger than you.

238
00:23:34.761 --> 00:23:37.938
My dad used to rave
about the. uh. the Negronis.

239
00:23:38.808 --> 00:23:40.244
You still serve that?

240
00:23:40.288 --> 00:23:41.942
Yes. I believe so. sir.

241
00:23:42.943 --> 00:23:44.727
The restaurant is open
until 9:00.

242
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:47.251
Let's go.

243
00:23:56.435 --> 00:23:57.436
She's staring at us.

244
00:24:01.744 --> 00:24:04.878
Don't look.
She's probably a prostitute.

245
00:24:05.139 --> 00:24:07.271
-Like your friend?

246
00:24:07.924 --> 00:24:09.404
Like my friend. who?

247
00:24:09.448 --> 00:24:11.841
-The one Mom caught you with.
-Brooke?

248
00:24:14.148 --> 00:24:16.542
No. Brooke is not a prostitute.

249
00:24:17.673 --> 00:24:19.762
Brooke is somebody
I used to work with.

250
00:24:20.937 --> 00:24:22.286
That's what Mom called her.

251
00:24:28.815 --> 00:24:29.903
Mmm.

252
00:24:29.946 --> 00:24:31.295
I remember that snake.

253
00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:35.212
It was here when my dad
took me on a road trip.

254
00:24:35.865 --> 00:24:38.302
He wanted to show me a house
he was gonna buy.

255
00:24:39.608 --> 00:24:40.870
Because he was leaving us.

256
00:24:40.914 --> 00:24:42.306
And he only told me.

257
00:24:43.873 --> 00:24:46.876
And he said it was our secret
and that I couldn't tell her.

258
00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:49.879
He said he'd tell her
when he was ready.

259
00:24:49.923 --> 00:24:51.402
'Cause he met someone else.

260
00:24:53.535 --> 00:24:55.363
I watched my father...

261
00:24:56.843 --> 00:24:57.931
pretend...

262
00:24:58.932 --> 00:25:00.107
for a month.

263
00:25:02.588 --> 00:25:04.503
Pretend to care
about my mother.

264
00:25:05.242 --> 00:25:06.983
Pretend that we were normal.

265
00:25:07.593 --> 00:25:09.899
And that that's the way
it was always gonna be.

266
00:25:11.031 --> 00:25:12.162
Just pretended.

267
00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.123
I started to hate him.

268
00:25:18.952 --> 00:25:23.478
I hated him more than anybody
in my whole life.

269
00:25:27.961 --> 00:25:30.224
Then he told her.
"We're getting a divorce."

270
00:25:30.267 --> 00:25:32.356
And he left us
on the same day.

271
00:25:33.619 --> 00:25:35.142
My mom didn't even know
what hit her.

272
00:25:35.185 --> 00:25:38.406
I remember... going to bed...

273
00:25:39.625 --> 00:25:43.367
and as I was falling asleep.
I could hear my mother...

274
00:25:45.021 --> 00:25:46.936
in the living room. crying.

275
00:25:54.596 --> 00:25:55.641
But here we are.

276
00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:02.604
-You guys all done here?
-Uh. yeah. Thanks.

277
00:26:02.648 --> 00:26:04.345
-Okay.

278
00:26:06.173 --> 00:26:07.566
Let me show you something.

279
00:26:13.267 --> 00:26:15.399
That is our destination.

280
00:26:18.577 --> 00:26:21.057
- Where is that?
-Mexico.

281
00:26:21.101 --> 00:26:22.232
Mexico?

282
00:26:22.972 --> 00:26:24.191
- Yeah.
-That's far.

283
00:26:24.234 --> 00:26:26.672
Yeah.
But it's only for the weekend.

284
00:26:27.716 --> 00:26:28.761
But. hey...

285
00:26:29.805 --> 00:26:32.460
this is only between us.

286
00:26:32.503 --> 00:26:36.725
You can't say anything
to anybody. including your mom.

287
00:26:38.988 --> 00:26:40.773
That is my casita.

288
00:26:40.816 --> 00:26:44.254
-That's yours?
-Yeah. that's mine.

289
00:26:44.864 --> 00:26:47.214
This is
the most amazing beach...

290
00:26:49.085 --> 00:26:50.739
that you will ever see.

291
00:26:51.435 --> 00:26:53.699
And the water
is so crystal clear

292
00:26:53.742 --> 00:26:56.049
that you can see the fish
even at night.

293
00:26:57.703 --> 00:27:00.270
But you don't have to go
if you don't want to. you know?

294
00:27:00.314 --> 00:27:02.795
And I would totally--
I'll totally understand.

295
00:27:03.926 --> 00:27:05.406
You know. it's your call.

296
00:27:14.807 --> 00:27:15.895
I'm going.

297
00:27:28.124 --> 00:27:29.560
One too many.

298
00:28:03.551 --> 00:28:04.639
Charlie?

299
00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:07.773
Hey. it's me.

300
00:28:08.817 --> 00:28:10.384
Where are you?

301
00:28:10.427 --> 00:28:12.168
We're at a hotel.
I can't say where.

302
00:28:12.212 --> 00:28:13.735
I'm not supposed
to be calling you.

303
00:28:13.779 --> 00:28:15.824
but I just wanted
to let you know
that I'm okay.

304
00:28:15.868 --> 00:28:18.740
You need to come home.
Your father doesn't have
my permission to see you.

305
00:28:18.784 --> 00:28:20.568
He has my permission.

306
00:28:20.611 --> 00:28:23.571
-Excuse me?
-I said he has my permission.

307
00:28:23.614 --> 00:28:26.139
I don't even know
what you're doing.
Where are you?

308
00:28:27.183 --> 00:28:30.796
Your dad
is in some trouble right now.
and he's not being rational.

309
00:28:30.839 --> 00:28:33.363
I'm worried about you.
You need to tell me
where you are.

310
00:28:33.407 --> 00:28:35.757
-We're going
to his house in Mexico.
-Mexico?

311
00:28:36.758 --> 00:28:37.628
Yes.

312
00:28:38.325 --> 00:28:39.761
You need to listen to me.

313
00:28:39.805 --> 00:28:42.633
Your father doesn't have
a house in Mexico.

314
00:28:45.114 --> 00:28:46.768
He doesn't have anything.

315
00:28:46.812 --> 00:28:48.552
All he's got is debt.
He just owes people money.

316
00:28:48.596 --> 00:28:50.206
He doesn't have a house.

317
00:28:52.034 --> 00:28:54.167
-Then what's he doing?
-He would say anything.

318
00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:56.430
-Why am I here?
-I don't know.

319
00:28:56.473 --> 00:28:58.737
-But he's obviously
having some problems.
-I don't believe you.

320
00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:00.651
-You're lying.
-No. I'm not.

321
00:29:00.695 --> 00:29:03.176
Would you please just tell me
where you are?

322
00:29:59.972 --> 00:30:00.973
Charlie?

323
00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:13.681
What are those?

324
00:30:15.248 --> 00:30:16.902
Leo. none of your business.

325
00:30:18.773 --> 00:30:20.035
Why did you throw up?

326
00:30:21.645 --> 00:30:22.777
Get out!

327
00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:46.714
Good night.

328
00:31:27.233 --> 00:31:29.800
-How long
since you've been back there?
-Where?

329
00:31:30.366 --> 00:31:31.846
The house on the beach.

330
00:31:34.196 --> 00:31:35.937
Um. um...

331
00:31:37.286 --> 00:31:38.548
A couple years.

332
00:31:39.985 --> 00:31:40.942
That long?

333
00:31:42.465 --> 00:31:44.250
Yeah. I've been busy.

334
00:31:46.295 --> 00:31:49.777
It's a shame.
but I've got somebody
watching the place.

335
00:31:51.431 --> 00:31:52.780
Do they know we're coming?

336
00:31:53.781 --> 00:31:55.826
Do they know we're coming?
There's really no need.

337
00:31:56.392 --> 00:31:57.959
Maybe we'll just
surprise them.

338
00:32:40.741 --> 00:32:42.221
I wanna drive.

339
00:32:42.264 --> 00:32:43.352
No way.

340
00:32:43.744 --> 00:32:45.093
Then I wanna go home.

341
00:32:47.008 --> 00:32:47.878
Why?

342
00:32:47.922 --> 00:32:48.967
Because.

343
00:32:50.446 --> 00:32:52.492
Are you kidding?

344
00:32:52.927 --> 00:32:55.843
-It's totally illegal.
-There's nobody around.

345
00:32:56.583 --> 00:32:59.064
You don't know how.
I don't have time
to teach you.

346
00:32:59.107 --> 00:33:00.979
-Let's go. come on.
-I already know.

347
00:33:01.414 --> 00:33:02.806
So you don't have to teach me.

348
00:33:04.591 --> 00:33:05.809
I doubt that.

349
00:33:06.245 --> 00:33:07.420
It's your call then.

350
00:33:07.463 --> 00:33:10.423
But if you drive. we go back.

351
00:33:25.264 --> 00:33:27.005
Okay? Feel all right?

352
00:33:27.831 --> 00:33:28.919
Good?

353
00:33:30.356 --> 00:33:32.836
All right. keep it at 55. okay?
Five-five. You got it?

354
00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.490
-What are you gonna keep it at?
-Fifty-five.

355
00:33:34.534 --> 00:33:36.057
That's right. 55. Good.

356
00:33:39.104 --> 00:33:40.975
All right.

357
00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:43.108
Good. Now. right here.
Look. Second gear.
keep your hand on here.

358
00:33:43.151 --> 00:33:45.240
Right here.
Second gear is gonna stick.

359
00:33:45.284 --> 00:33:48.591
So. when you pull that down.
you're gonna ease off
the clutch. okay?

360
00:33:48.635 --> 00:33:50.071
Keep eyes on the road. Okay.

361
00:33:50.115 --> 00:33:52.421
Look. look. right here.
Leo. watch the potholes.

362
00:33:53.248 --> 00:33:55.033
-See them? Oh!

363
00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:05.869
-You okay?
-Yeah.

364
00:34:05.913 --> 00:34:06.870
Okay.

365
00:34:08.872 --> 00:34:10.744
All right.
take this right up here.

366
00:34:12.963 --> 00:34:14.922
I don't wanna get pulled over
by the cops again.

367
00:34:31.112 --> 00:34:32.940
Your mom ever tell you
why we broke up?

368
00:34:37.336 --> 00:34:38.772
-Huh?
-Yes.

369
00:34:38.815 --> 00:34:40.556
Yeah? Tell me what she said.

370
00:34:44.256 --> 00:34:46.345
She said
you're an evil maniac.

371
00:34:48.173 --> 00:34:49.435
Egomaniac.

372
00:34:50.131 --> 00:34:51.872
No. Evil maniac.

373
00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:55.354
She said you're
a borderline personality.

374
00:34:55.397 --> 00:34:58.096
You started sleeping around.
because you thought we weren't
good enough for you

375
00:34:58.139 --> 00:34:59.575
and that you could do better.

376
00:35:01.229 --> 00:35:03.144
She says that
you're an empty person
who lies and cheats

377
00:35:03.188 --> 00:35:05.059
-and that you're not a real man.
-Okay.

378
00:35:07.235 --> 00:35:08.802
I'm glad she's so objective.

379
00:35:11.239 --> 00:35:13.023
When you realized
you were a shitty painter.

380
00:35:13.067 --> 00:35:16.157
you started to hate yourself.
and then you blamed us.

381
00:35:16.636 --> 00:35:18.159
You wanna know why
I left your mom?

382
00:35:18.203 --> 00:35:19.769
I left her
because life is short

383
00:35:19.813 --> 00:35:21.858
and you only have
one life to live.

384
00:35:33.696 --> 00:35:38.092
Look. your mom is angry.
which is understandable
to an extent.

385
00:35:38.136 --> 00:35:41.269
Okay? But she's not rational.
There's two sides to a story.

386
00:35:43.706 --> 00:35:45.839
-Hey.

387
00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:48.494
-I'm talking to you. okay?

388
00:35:48.537 --> 00:35:50.104
This is important.

389
00:35:50.844 --> 00:35:53.151
-Hey. I said turn it off!

390
00:35:53.673 --> 00:35:56.110
-Not when I'm talking. okay?

391
00:35:56.154 --> 00:35:58.199
-I said turn it off
and keep that shit off.

392
00:35:58.243 --> 00:36:00.158
-Hey! Turn it off!

393
00:36:01.768 --> 00:36:03.857
And don't turn it on
until I say.

394
00:36:18.263 --> 00:36:19.829
-Pull over.
-What just happened?

395
00:36:19.873 --> 00:36:20.961
Pull over.

396
00:36:28.795 --> 00:36:29.796
Wait here.

397
00:36:44.202 --> 00:36:45.551
Son of a bitch.

398
00:37:13.535 --> 00:37:14.623
Can you fix it?

399
00:37:15.276 --> 00:37:16.886
What do you think
I'm trying to do?

400
00:37:29.943 --> 00:37:32.119
Goddamn it!

401
00:37:34.339 --> 00:37:35.427
Is it broken?

402
00:37:40.997 --> 00:37:43.086
Goddamn it!

403
00:37:49.005 --> 00:37:50.572
No signal.

404
00:37:54.097 --> 00:37:55.403
No signal.

405
00:37:56.752 --> 00:37:58.711
You were the one who told me
to come down this road.

406
00:37:58.754 --> 00:38:00.800
Yeah. and who was messing
with the radio?

407
00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:16.555
What are you doing?

408
00:38:18.208 --> 00:38:19.645
If you can't fix it. I will.

409
00:38:21.037 --> 00:38:23.779
Fix what?
You don't even know
what you're fixing.

410
00:38:40.492 --> 00:38:41.449
What's this?

411
00:38:43.843 --> 00:38:45.801
It's a spare key.
Give it to me.

412
00:38:52.417 --> 00:38:55.115
Come on. stop. Get up.
Get up. You don't know
what you're doing. Get up.

413
00:38:57.639 --> 00:39:01.034
Why do you drive
this shitty car. anyway?
Do you think it's cool?

414
00:39:01.077 --> 00:39:02.688
It's a piece of shit.

415
00:39:02.731 --> 00:39:04.472
You're not gonna talk to me
like that. I'm your father.

416
00:39:04.516 --> 00:39:07.301
-Since when?
-Always have been.
always will be.

417
00:39:07.345 --> 00:39:08.824
and that ain't ever
gonna change.

418
00:39:08.868 --> 00:39:11.218
You're not my dad.
You're just an accident.

419
00:39:12.698 --> 00:39:14.700
-You know what?
-Get the hell away from me!

420
00:39:15.875 --> 00:39:17.529
What are you--
Are you gonna hit me?

421
00:39:17.572 --> 00:39:19.661
Yeah? Is this like
some kind of man-to-man thing?

422
00:39:19.705 --> 00:39:21.576
You lied.
You're nothing but a liar.

423
00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:23.273
Lied about what?
I've never lied--

424
00:39:23.317 --> 00:39:25.406
-Leo!
-Your house!

425
00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:26.929
You don't have one.

426
00:39:27.408 --> 00:39:28.453
Liar!

427
00:39:29.062 --> 00:39:30.193
Mom told me.

428
00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:32.413
You don't have anything.

429
00:39:34.676 --> 00:39:36.199
Why are you doing this?

430
00:39:39.289 --> 00:39:40.900
What do you want from me?

431
00:39:46.384 --> 00:39:47.472
What are you doing?

432
00:39:49.212 --> 00:39:50.475
Where do you think
you're going?

433
00:39:53.478 --> 00:39:54.522
Leo?

434
00:40:00.267 --> 00:40:01.573
Leo. come here!

435
00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:03.966
Where are you going?

436
00:41:00.632 --> 00:41:01.676
Leo...

437
00:41:02.547 --> 00:41:03.983
Le...

438
00:42:10.092 --> 00:42:12.138
Thank you. Thank you.

439
00:42:17.186 --> 00:42:19.275
Hey. Someone's coming.

440
00:43:09.587 --> 00:43:11.240
I can hear that axle.

441
00:43:15.462 --> 00:43:17.029
You know.
I don't blame your mom.

442
00:43:18.073 --> 00:43:20.162
I don't like what you said...

443
00:43:22.077 --> 00:43:24.210
but she has the right
to be angry. you know? I...

444
00:43:25.907 --> 00:43:27.474
I did some stupid stuff.

445
00:43:33.523 --> 00:43:34.612
You know. she's...

446
00:43:37.266 --> 00:43:38.441
She's a good person.

447
00:43:42.141 --> 00:43:44.622
I. um...
I guess I just. uh...

448
00:43:45.797 --> 00:43:46.798
I don't know.

449
00:43:48.364 --> 00:43:50.149
I shouldn't have said
that stuff and...

450
00:43:53.282 --> 00:43:55.110
I shouldn't have said it.

451
00:43:55.589 --> 00:43:57.547
Do you have a girlfriend?
Boyfriend?

452
00:44:03.684 --> 00:44:04.772
-No.
-No.

453
00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:07.079
No further questions.

454
00:45:03.918 --> 00:45:04.832
Right here.

455
00:45:10.272 --> 00:45:11.317
All right.

456
00:45:12.318 --> 00:45:13.972
-Hey. How goes it?
-Hey. How are you?

457
00:45:14.015 --> 00:45:16.801
-Uh. I would like a room
for my son and I.
-All right.

458
00:45:17.584 --> 00:45:19.673
Just fill that out
for me here.

459
00:45:19.717 --> 00:45:21.893
No. I'm not sharing
a room with him.

460
00:45:23.068 --> 00:45:24.199
I want my own.

461
00:45:25.331 --> 00:45:27.115
That's fine?
Are you gonna pay for it?

462
00:45:30.031 --> 00:45:31.206
-That's good.
-Okay.

463
00:45:36.646 --> 00:45:38.039
- All right.
- Here you go.

464
00:45:38.605 --> 00:45:41.564
We have 121 for you. 121.

465
00:45:41.608 --> 00:45:42.783
Excellent.
Thank you very much.

466
00:45:53.272 --> 00:45:54.752
You might wanna
change out of that.

467
00:45:57.232 --> 00:45:58.277
I'm good.

468
00:45:59.844 --> 00:46:00.758
All right.

469
00:46:02.063 --> 00:46:04.500
Uh. well. I'm gonna
take the car down and. uh--

470
00:46:05.197 --> 00:46:08.243
I'm gonna get it looked at.
see if I can get that
rattling sound fixed.

471
00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:11.681
Maybe when I get back.
we'll. uh. grab some dinner?
Cool?

472
00:46:14.075 --> 00:46:15.033
Okay.

473
00:46:15.555 --> 00:46:16.817
All right. Um...

474
00:46:17.687 --> 00:46:20.212
Oh. There you go.
Watch some TV.

475
00:46:20.255 --> 00:46:21.343
No porn.

476
00:47:23.579 --> 00:47:24.493
Charlie?

477
00:47:24.537 --> 00:47:25.625
Anton. what's up?

478
00:47:26.017 --> 00:47:27.583
I met your son.

479
00:47:28.062 --> 00:47:30.891
Yeah. so I heard.
You make a great impression.

480
00:47:31.979 --> 00:47:35.983
-I'm sitting here
with Gemini. Charlie.
-Hey. Charlie.

481
00:47:38.377 --> 00:47:39.944
My man. how's it going?

482
00:47:40.683 --> 00:47:43.817
Everything is everything.
-Yeah. Right?

483
00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:47.908
How are we going to do this?

484
00:47:51.259 --> 00:47:52.391
Here's the thing.

485
00:47:54.175 --> 00:47:55.263
You're out of luck.

486
00:47:56.351 --> 00:47:58.353
I'm already gone.

487
00:47:58.397 --> 00:48:00.616
-Who are you gonna sell it to?
-I don't give a shit anymore.

488
00:48:01.574 --> 00:48:04.794
Charlie. I spoke
to Mr. Wilson today.

489
00:48:04.838 --> 00:48:07.188
Mr. Wilson. Fantastic.
Who's that?

490
00:48:07.232 --> 00:48:09.843
He's your son's
English teacher.

491
00:48:10.757 --> 00:48:12.541
At Spring Valley Middle School.

492
00:48:12.585 --> 00:48:14.892
Do you know
what he got on his midterm?

493
00:48:17.242 --> 00:48:19.070
No. Gemini. Tell me.

494
00:48:19.113 --> 00:48:20.375
He got an A.

495
00:48:24.423 --> 00:48:25.467
Shit.

496
00:48:33.345 --> 00:48:34.215
Leo?

497
00:48:35.042 --> 00:48:36.957
Leo. Hey. I'm back.

498
00:48:49.665 --> 00:48:52.364
Excuse me. Um. I checked in
with my son earlier today.

499
00:48:52.407 --> 00:48:54.757
-You haven't seen him. have you?
-I haven't. sir.

500
00:49:02.374 --> 00:49:03.331
Leo?

501
00:49:05.464 --> 00:49:06.465
Leo?

502
00:49:09.033 --> 00:49:09.947
Leo.

503
00:49:19.043 --> 00:49:21.219
Leo. do me a favor.

504
00:49:21.262 --> 00:49:24.222
For the rest of this trip.
I don't want you leaving
the room without telling me.

505
00:49:24.265 --> 00:49:26.398
Okay? I was looking
all over for you.

506
00:49:27.573 --> 00:49:28.530
Hey.

507
00:49:28.835 --> 00:49:30.663
Hey. I'm talking to you.
Look at me.

508
00:49:33.057 --> 00:49:34.145
What did you do?

509
00:49:35.668 --> 00:49:36.843
Did you go swimming?

510
00:49:39.237 --> 00:49:41.761
I think we should
stay the night.
and in the morning...

511
00:49:42.718 --> 00:49:45.591
I think--
I think we should go home.

512
00:49:50.074 --> 00:49:51.031
Go home?

513
00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:54.774
Is that a joke?

514
00:49:56.689 --> 00:49:58.343
I don't think
this is a good idea.

515
00:49:58.691 --> 00:50:00.693
You mom is really upset
right now.

516
00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:05.132
So. you are lying?

517
00:50:06.568 --> 00:50:07.439
No.

518
00:50:08.875 --> 00:50:10.398
You don't have a house.

519
00:50:12.139 --> 00:50:14.272
Leo. here's the thing. okay?
It's complicated. but I know--

520
00:50:14.315 --> 00:50:17.057
What? Did you meet a girl?

521
00:50:17.492 --> 00:50:19.407
-No.
-You need some space?

522
00:50:19.451 --> 00:50:20.887
-Listen to me--
-Get off!

523
00:50:21.366 --> 00:50:22.932
Hey. relax.

524
00:50:23.455 --> 00:50:25.718
Can I help you?
Is everything okay?

525
00:50:25.761 --> 00:50:28.416
Yes. Yeah.
We just ordered some fries.

526
00:50:30.723 --> 00:50:32.812
What is wrong with you?
What is this? Hey!

527
00:50:32.855 --> 00:50:34.553
What are you doing?
Where did you get this?

528
00:50:34.596 --> 00:50:36.598
-What do you care?
-Hey!

529
00:50:36.642 --> 00:50:37.730
You're an asshole!

530
00:50:41.603 --> 00:50:43.692
Leo. Leo. wait.

531
00:50:43.736 --> 00:50:46.217
Come here. Leo.
I need to talk to you now.

532
00:50:46.695 --> 00:50:47.957
Leo. stop!

533
00:50:48.567 --> 00:50:49.568
Will you please...

534
00:50:50.699 --> 00:50:52.440
Will you listen to me? Leo.

535
00:50:54.573 --> 00:50:56.836
Leo. talk to me! Leo. stop!

536
00:50:56.879 --> 00:50:59.360
Just go! Leave me alone!

537
00:50:59.404 --> 00:51:01.710
Why are you causing a scene?
You're embarrassing me.

538
00:51:01.754 --> 00:51:03.321
I'm embarrassing you?

539
00:51:04.191 --> 00:51:07.847
This is my dad. everyone.
Right here!

540
00:51:07.890 --> 00:51:10.980
He cheated on my mom.
He lied to me!

541
00:51:11.024 --> 00:51:13.983
No! He's a pathetic loser!

542
00:51:16.073 --> 00:51:18.988
But other than that.
he's a great guy.

543
00:51:19.032 --> 00:51:19.946
Leo. no...

544
00:51:19.989 --> 00:51:21.208
You win.

545
00:51:21.817 --> 00:51:23.384
Leave me alone!

546
00:53:49.356 --> 00:53:50.401
Mr. Bond.

547
00:53:52.185 --> 00:53:53.534
How are you feeling
this morning?

548
00:53:55.014 --> 00:53:56.668
Can you see me clearly?

549
00:53:57.625 --> 00:53:58.844
Yeah.

550
00:53:58.887 --> 00:54:00.280
Do you have a headache?

551
00:54:00.715 --> 00:54:02.543
No. Where's my son?

552
00:54:02.587 --> 00:54:05.111
He's here at the hospital.
He spent the night
in the guest room.

553
00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:12.031
I. um...

554
00:54:13.511 --> 00:54:15.817
-I spoke to your doctor.

555
00:54:20.387 --> 00:54:22.955
I understand that you have
a stage 4 brain tumor.

556
00:54:25.218 --> 00:54:27.046
You really should be
in treatment.

557
00:54:28.482 --> 00:54:29.875
You're a very sick man.

558
00:54:30.876 --> 00:54:32.269
I'm not sick.

559
00:54:32.791 --> 00:54:34.271
I'm dying.

560
00:54:37.970 --> 00:54:39.711
You could save yourself
a lot of pain.

561
00:54:40.494 --> 00:54:42.583
Thank you.

562
00:54:53.768 --> 00:54:57.250
Can I ask you. um.
is your son aware?

563
00:54:58.207 --> 00:55:00.558
He'll know... soon enough.

564
00:55:02.516 --> 00:55:04.388
I would advise you
to think this through.

565
00:55:05.432 --> 00:55:06.738
Every single day counts.

566
00:55:07.739 --> 00:55:10.655
And this...
doesn't just affect you.

567
00:55:11.612 --> 00:55:12.961
It affects
everyone around you.

568
00:55:17.618 --> 00:55:19.228
Oh. Well. there he is.

569
00:55:21.187 --> 00:55:22.841
I want to run a few more tests.
and then we'll speak again.
All right?

570
00:55:23.842 --> 00:55:24.669
Come on in.

571
00:55:25.104 --> 00:55:25.974
Come in.

572
00:55:33.068 --> 00:55:34.505
How's the hangover?

573
00:55:36.463 --> 00:55:37.638
What's wrong with you?

574
00:55:41.163 --> 00:55:43.122
I just gotta take it easy
for a while.

575
00:55:44.515 --> 00:55:46.473
No more punches to the face.

576
00:55:46.952 --> 00:55:48.127
Sorry I hit you.

577
00:55:52.871 --> 00:55:54.046
I think I deserved it.

578
00:55:56.831 --> 00:55:58.093
Did it feel good?

579
00:56:01.967 --> 00:56:03.447
-I don't remember.

580
00:56:08.147 --> 00:56:10.367
The hotel put your car
in the parking lot.

581
00:56:15.328 --> 00:56:16.503
Can I have this?

582
00:56:17.417 --> 00:56:18.287
Yes. you can.

583
00:56:41.833 --> 00:56:43.487
Excuse me.

584
00:56:43.530 --> 00:56:46.490
I just want to let you know
your cousin is on the way up.

585
00:56:47.404 --> 00:56:48.317
Cousin?

586
00:56:48.709 --> 00:56:50.407
-Who?
-Anton.

587
00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:53.888
I forgot.

588
00:56:54.976 --> 00:56:57.414
He called last night.
Is he your cousin?

589
00:56:58.893 --> 00:57:00.591
He wanted to give you
the paycheck.

590
00:57:05.204 --> 00:57:08.120
-Where's the car?
-Second level. way in the back.

591
00:57:08.163 --> 00:57:10.905
Okay. Where's...
Where's my phone?

592
00:57:11.819 --> 00:57:12.994
No. no. keep it.

593
00:57:13.038 --> 00:57:14.431
Um...

594
00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:18.347
Okay. listen.
I need you to listen to me.
All right?

595
00:57:19.261 --> 00:57:20.393
He can't see you.

596
00:57:21.046 --> 00:57:23.440
All right.
Okay. I need you to do this.

597
00:57:23.483 --> 00:57:24.876
Why can't they see me?

598
00:57:25.485 --> 00:57:28.227
I'll take care of this.
but if I'm not back in an hour.

599
00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:30.708
Leo. you need to call your mom.
She's gonna come pick you up.

600
00:57:31.578 --> 00:57:34.102
What do you mean if
you're not back in an hour?
Shouldn't I call the cops?

601
00:57:34.146 --> 00:57:37.845
No. do not call the police.
If you call the police.
I go to jail. Okay?

602
00:58:21.367 --> 00:58:22.499
Here we are.

603
00:58:26.938 --> 00:58:28.330
Is everything all right?

604
00:58:30.202 --> 00:58:31.159
I'm fine.

605
00:58:44.042 --> 00:58:46.827
Garcia was
the first call I made.

606
00:58:49.308 --> 00:58:50.178
Well?

607
00:58:52.529 --> 00:58:54.052
He's not going to buy it.

608
00:59:02.843 --> 00:59:03.888
Do you have it?

609
00:59:06.107 --> 00:59:07.152
It's right here.

610
00:59:07.674 --> 00:59:08.545
Where?

611
00:59:08.936 --> 00:59:09.850
In the back.

612
00:59:32.046 --> 00:59:33.526
Any damage?

613
00:59:34.135 --> 00:59:35.441
Never took it out.

614
00:59:37.399 --> 00:59:38.879
What do you say?

615
00:59:40.751 --> 00:59:41.665
Excuse me?

616
00:59:42.927 --> 00:59:45.016
What do you say
if someone punches your neck?

617
00:59:47.148 --> 00:59:48.149
Charlie.

618
00:59:54.460 --> 00:59:56.810
Charlie. Charlie...

619
00:59:57.376 --> 00:59:58.856
You have to improve
your vocab--

620
01:00:05.166 --> 01:00:06.211
Get down!

621
01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:07.865
Leo.

622
01:00:08.692 --> 01:00:10.607
Leo. Leo. put down the gun.

623
01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:12.173
- Listen to your dad.
- On the ground!

624
01:00:12.217 --> 01:00:14.001
- Leo!
- Do it!

625
01:00:15.089 --> 01:00:17.091
Leo. put down the gun
and walk away.

626
01:00:17.135 --> 01:00:18.310
Why?

627
01:00:18.353 --> 01:00:19.659
-What's that?
- Nothing.

628
01:00:19.703 --> 01:00:21.530
-Shut up!
-It belongs to me.

629
01:00:25.273 --> 01:00:26.448
Get their keys.

630
01:00:27.145 --> 01:00:28.712
Listen to your daddy. kid.

631
01:00:29.495 --> 01:00:31.410
Check their pockets
and get their keys.

632
01:00:31.889 --> 01:00:33.804
- Leo. listen.
-Do it.

633
01:00:33.847 --> 01:00:37.503
-Give me the gun.
You don't wanna do this.
-Kid. put the gun down.

634
01:00:38.286 --> 01:00:39.853
-Put it down.
- Leo.

635
01:00:40.854 --> 01:00:42.464
You don't wanna do this.

636
01:00:44.423 --> 01:00:45.598
Do it!

637
01:00:54.738 --> 01:00:56.870
- Whoa!

638
01:00:56.914 --> 01:00:58.089
Who were those guys?

639
01:00:58.959 --> 01:01:01.527
-Are they gonna come after us?

640
01:01:03.050 --> 01:01:03.964
Charlie?

641
01:01:24.332 --> 01:01:25.682
Goddamn it.

642
01:01:28.597 --> 01:01:29.555
Shit!

643
01:01:30.861 --> 01:01:32.427
-What's the matter?
-Why would you do that?

644
01:01:35.256 --> 01:01:38.695
When I tell you to do something.
you do it! Okay?

645
01:01:39.347 --> 01:01:41.610
-They were gonna hurt you!
-Who cares?

646
01:01:43.482 --> 01:01:44.613
It's not your problem.

647
01:01:46.441 --> 01:01:48.966
-I saved you!
-No. you didn't.

648
01:01:49.009 --> 01:01:52.273
No one can save me.
You worry about yourself.

649
01:01:52.317 --> 01:01:53.797
That's all you can do.

650
01:02:42.149 --> 01:02:43.368
What did you get in English?

651
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:45.587
What?

652
01:02:46.371 --> 01:02:47.851
On your midterm?

653
01:02:48.590 --> 01:02:50.854
-Last semester?
-Yeah. whatever.

654
01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:53.378
I got an A.

655
01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:57.948
That's pretty good.

656
01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:04.128
All right. listen.
we have to make a detour.

657
01:03:08.567 --> 01:03:10.090
Are we still going to Mexico?

658
01:03:11.570 --> 01:03:12.789
I'm working on it.

659
01:04:15.895 --> 01:04:17.331
My mom was a painter.

660
01:04:18.767 --> 01:04:21.640
I'd come up here with her.
and we'd stake out a spot.

661
01:04:24.034 --> 01:04:26.819
Get here early in the morning
right when the sun
was coming up.

662
01:04:30.518 --> 01:04:32.172
The thing about painting is

663
01:04:32.216 --> 01:04:34.305
when you're doing it.
you get so involved that...

664
01:04:35.523 --> 01:04:36.873
just lose track of time.

665
01:04:43.618 --> 01:04:45.316
I used to think
my mom was a failure

666
01:04:45.359 --> 01:04:47.796
because she never sold
a painting in her life.

667
01:04:51.278 --> 01:04:52.323
She loved it.

668
01:04:59.417 --> 01:05:02.724
That's all that counts...
in life.

669
01:05:02.768 --> 01:05:05.989
That's all that counts.
and everything else is nonsense.

670
01:05:22.875 --> 01:05:26.096
This painting was stolen
during World War II.

671
01:05:26.705 --> 01:05:28.446
Original owner was killed.

672
01:05:28.489 --> 01:05:31.275
It was found in Argentina.
then it went missing again.

673
01:05:31.318 --> 01:05:33.407
It's been selling
on the black market for years.

674
01:05:33.451 --> 01:05:35.540
Anton was gonna get
a million for it.

675
01:05:38.151 --> 01:05:40.110
A million bucks.

676
01:05:40.153 --> 01:05:42.721
A piece of art is worth
whatever a buyer
will pay for it.

677
01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:46.420
What would you do
with a million bucks?

678
01:05:49.641 --> 01:05:50.947
What would you do?

679
01:05:56.256 --> 01:05:58.519
All right. Come on.

680
01:05:58.563 --> 01:06:00.957
I gotta make one more stop
because there's somebody
I want you to meet.

681
01:06:40.822 --> 01:06:43.216
I haven't even spoken to him
since my mom's funeral.

682
01:06:44.043 --> 01:06:45.610
Are you sure
he still lives here?

683
01:06:54.097 --> 01:06:55.533
-Hey.
-Hey. Dad.

684
01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:02.148
What are you doing here?

685
01:07:04.063 --> 01:07:06.370
I just need to talk
for a few minutes. Please.

686
01:07:08.154 --> 01:07:10.417
-What. did you get lost
or something?
-No.

687
01:07:13.899 --> 01:07:15.031
Can we come in?

688
01:07:18.077 --> 01:07:20.079
-Yeah. yeah. Come on in.
-Thanks.

689
01:07:24.866 --> 01:07:27.478
-Do you want a drink?
-No. No. thanks.

690
01:07:27.521 --> 01:07:28.957
-No?
-Don't have the time.

691
01:07:29.741 --> 01:07:30.959
It's okay.

692
01:07:32.222 --> 01:07:33.962
Is this your mom?

693
01:07:34.006 --> 01:07:37.140
Yes. She would've been 68.

694
01:07:37.183 --> 01:07:38.402
Last week.

695
01:07:40.099 --> 01:07:42.667
-I'm sorry to drop in like this.
-No problem.

696
01:07:43.276 --> 01:07:44.843
It's only been a few years.

697
01:07:46.758 --> 01:07:49.326
-So. are you gonna be around
for a few days or what?
- Um...

698
01:07:49.804 --> 01:07:50.762
Are you okay?

699
01:07:52.111 --> 01:07:53.243
Yeah.

700
01:07:54.287 --> 01:07:56.115
I will be.

701
01:07:56.159 --> 01:07:58.683
Uh. things are a little
messed up right now.
but I'm fixing it.

702
01:07:58.726 --> 01:08:00.641
I needed somebody to watch him
for a couple of hours.

703
01:08:00.685 --> 01:08:02.513
Oh. sure.
That's cool.

704
01:08:02.556 --> 01:08:04.993
So. uh. what is it?
It's Leo. right?

705
01:08:05.690 --> 01:08:07.909
Yeah.

706
01:08:07.953 --> 01:08:10.869
You know. I remember when
you were about that big.
You remember that?

707
01:08:11.522 --> 01:08:13.350
No? That's okay.

708
01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:16.614
-How'd you like a drink?
-Sure.

709
01:08:18.006 --> 01:08:19.269
I'll be right back.

710
01:08:27.015 --> 01:08:30.149
I'll see you later.
I'll just be at a hotel
down the road.

711
01:08:31.019 --> 01:08:32.412
Are you meeting those guys?

712
01:08:32.717 --> 01:08:34.458
Of course not.

713
01:08:35.937 --> 01:08:37.243
Don't worry about that.

714
01:08:38.505 --> 01:08:40.159
That's gonna get taken care of.

715
01:08:44.859 --> 01:08:46.644
- Dad?
-Yeah?

716
01:08:51.649 --> 01:08:53.172
Are you sure
you're okay with him?

717
01:08:53.216 --> 01:08:54.913
Oh. yeah. I'm fine.

718
01:08:54.956 --> 01:08:56.654
Sofia. how's she doing?

719
01:08:59.570 --> 01:09:01.093
We're not together anymore.

720
01:09:02.834 --> 01:09:04.140
When did that happen?

721
01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:07.882
Five years ago.

722
01:09:10.102 --> 01:09:11.625
-Five years.
-Yeah.

723
01:09:14.237 --> 01:09:15.803
History repeats itself.

724
01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:18.980
I'm really sorry
to hear that.

725
01:09:20.156 --> 01:09:21.287
I'm sorry too.

726
01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:25.073
But... she's a survivor.

727
01:09:26.205 --> 01:09:27.293
So is Leo.

728
01:09:30.644 --> 01:09:31.819
You're looking good. Dad.

729
01:09:33.908 --> 01:09:36.607
I forgot
it was Mom's birthday
last week. I miss her.

730
01:09:37.477 --> 01:09:38.739
I miss her a lot.

731
01:09:49.272 --> 01:09:50.534
I miss her too.

732
01:10:16.734 --> 01:10:19.693
-You like a room?
-Yeah. just for a few hours.

733
01:10:19.737 --> 01:10:21.782
Doesn't matter.
It's thirty bucks.

734
01:10:22.696 --> 01:10:23.654
Fine.

735
01:10:44.370 --> 01:10:45.937
Why did you do this?

736
01:10:49.375 --> 01:10:50.942
I just wanted to see him.

737
01:10:52.291 --> 01:10:54.946
You never wanted to see him.
Why now?

738
01:11:00.821 --> 01:11:02.475
You gonna tell me
what's going on?

739
01:11:07.959 --> 01:11:09.569
Charlie. are you okay?

740
01:11:15.967 --> 01:11:20.363
You don't have to
wait for dinnertime to enjoy
the famed Scarlet O'Hara.

741
01:11:20.885 --> 01:11:23.714
Enchanting as its namesake.

742
01:11:23.757 --> 01:11:25.890
Here's a drink
that tastes great anytime.

743
01:11:26.456 --> 01:11:27.457
Ah. boy.

744
01:11:34.028 --> 01:11:35.291
Hello.

745
01:11:36.379 --> 01:11:37.249
Sofia?

746
01:11:39.512 --> 01:11:41.166
-Is that Mom?
-Yeah.

747
01:11:41.819 --> 01:11:43.951
No. go ahead.
Yeah. it's okay.

748
01:11:45.518 --> 01:11:46.519
What's wrong?

749
01:11:54.745 --> 01:11:55.702
Right.

750
01:11:59.010 --> 01:11:59.967
Okay.

751
01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:06.512
Turn around. Charlie.

752
01:13:22.267 --> 01:13:23.355
No.

753
01:13:35.672 --> 01:13:36.803
Where is it?

754
01:13:39.545 --> 01:13:40.503
Where is it?

755
01:13:43.462 --> 01:13:44.768
Is this a joke?

756
01:13:45.464 --> 01:13:46.552
Get back!

757
01:13:49.512 --> 01:13:50.469
Get back.

758
01:13:55.779 --> 01:13:57.041
Leo!

759
01:14:02.002 --> 01:14:03.090
Charlie.

760
01:14:04.048 --> 01:14:04.962
Wake up.

761
01:14:05.832 --> 01:14:07.747
-Charlie.

762
01:14:07.791 --> 01:14:09.053
Can you hear me?

763
01:14:09.619 --> 01:14:10.576
Wake up.

764
01:14:12.622 --> 01:14:13.666
Where are we?

765
01:14:14.798 --> 01:14:16.190
They put us in the truck.

766
01:14:19.019 --> 01:14:21.239
- You okay?
-Yeah.

767
01:14:26.853 --> 01:14:27.985
Is it true?

768
01:14:30.074 --> 01:14:33.077
I just couldn't--
I just couldn't tell you.

769
01:14:34.208 --> 01:14:35.645
I didn't know how.

770
01:14:37.255 --> 01:14:38.474
I wanted to...

771
01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:42.042
I wanted to tell you
when we got there.

772
01:15:10.897 --> 01:15:11.985
Charlie.

773
01:15:13.421 --> 01:15:14.510
Charlie.

774
01:15:19.558 --> 01:15:20.472
Charlie!

775
01:15:21.038 --> 01:15:22.082
Get up!

776
01:15:26.609 --> 01:15:28.567
I want to show you something.

777
01:15:37.184 --> 01:15:38.185
Are you okay?

778
01:15:39.012 --> 01:15:41.232
-He's not a part of this.
-He is now.

779
01:15:41.275 --> 01:15:42.712
- Get off!
-Sit down.

780
01:15:43.147 --> 01:15:45.236
-No!
- Back the hell off!

781
01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:51.372
Take that gun off him.
Take that gun off him!

782
01:15:51.416 --> 01:15:53.984
Charlie... where is it?

783
01:15:54.941 --> 01:15:57.944
Let me talk to my son.
and I'll take you to it.

784
01:15:57.988 --> 01:15:59.119
Take me where?

785
01:15:59.729 --> 01:16:00.947
First. let him go.

786
01:16:01.687 --> 01:16:03.428
Please. Anton.

787
01:16:15.919 --> 01:16:16.963
You all right?

788
01:16:18.748 --> 01:16:20.924
I gotta take them there.
I need you to stay here.

789
01:16:20.967 --> 01:16:22.926
-I'm not staying.
I wanna go with you.
-No!

790
01:16:23.230 --> 01:16:25.885
No. You need to stay here.
I can't have you going with us.

791
01:16:25.929 --> 01:16:28.888
-They're gonna kill you.
-No. they're not. I promise.

792
01:16:28.932 --> 01:16:30.977
I'm going to give them
the painting. and it's over.

793
01:16:31.499 --> 01:16:33.066
You can't be serious?

794
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:35.416
-You want to leave your kid--
-He'll be fine.

795
01:16:37.723 --> 01:16:39.551
Remember when we got stuck
in the desert?

796
01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:40.900
When we broke down.

797
01:16:41.597 --> 01:16:42.946
you tried to fix it?

798
01:16:45.992 --> 01:16:47.733
Yeah. I remember.

799
01:16:49.517 --> 01:16:50.823
But what about you?

800
01:16:52.782 --> 01:16:54.174
- Charlie.
-Don't worry.

801
01:16:54.218 --> 01:16:55.698
Let's get it done.

802
01:16:55.741 --> 01:16:57.308
You drive the car.

803
01:16:58.831 --> 01:16:59.702
Move!

804
01:17:07.318 --> 01:17:08.449
Enjoy the sun. kid.

805
01:17:09.712 --> 01:17:11.017
You could use a tan.

806
01:18:17.083 --> 01:18:18.694
How far are we going?

807
01:18:19.825 --> 01:18:22.132
Just a little bit further.
Relax.

808
01:18:44.197 --> 01:18:46.286
Why are we taking
this dirt road?

809
01:18:48.027 --> 01:18:49.812
He asked you
a question. Charlie.

810
01:19:44.257 --> 01:19:45.563
Drive carefully.

811
01:19:57.183 --> 01:19:58.315
You okay?

812
01:19:59.011 --> 01:19:59.882
I'm fine.

813
01:20:00.970 --> 01:20:02.101
Are you hungry?

814
01:20:06.192 --> 01:20:08.020
Leo? Leo?

815
01:20:09.935 --> 01:20:11.981
You left your book bag
in the house.

816
01:20:14.897 --> 01:20:15.811
Okay.
