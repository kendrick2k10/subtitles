I've always been obsessed with the idea
of a one-man-band.

215
00:16:34.203 --> 00:16:39.041
to use one person

I chose Danzón

226

The importance of <i>Coco</i> is beyond belief

344
00:32:17.813 --> 00:32:22.067
because I was privileged enough
to voice Papa Rivera in the movie.

345
00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:23.944
I play Miguel's dad in the movie.

346
00:32:24.027 --> 00:32:28.073
So I worked very closely with Lee Unkrich
and Adrian Molina.

347
00:32:28.156 --> 00:32:33.287
What they did
to really play homage to our culture.

348
00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:35.998
to the celebration of <i>Día de Muertos.</i>
was insane.

349
00:32:36.081 --> 00:32:40.627
They flew to Mexico and they went
to these celebrations in Morelia.

350
00:32:40.711 --> 00:32:42.713
in Guanajuato. in Patzcuaro.

351
00:32:42.796 --> 00:32:46.383
and they really. really
learned the culture.

352
00:32:46.466 --> 00:32:48.010
So when you see <i>Coco.</i>

353
00:32:48.093 --> 00:32:52.639
you actually see my culture
depicted very accurately

354
00:32:52.723 --> 00:32:56.560

when we celebrate this beautiful holiday.

<i>Coco </i>is a film that’s all about music
and it celebrates music

388
00:35:31.381 --> 00:35:34.176
but there actually aren't many songs
in the movie.

389
00:35:34.259 --> 00:35:37.513
So when we were trying to figure out
how to mount the movie live

390
00:35:37.596 --> 00:35:38.805
at the Hollywood Bowl.

391
00:35:38.889 --> 00:35:41.391
one of the things
that the director Felipe brought

392
00:35:41.475 --> 00:35:45.354
was the idea of including a lot of songs
that weren't actually in the film.

393
00:35:45.771 --> 00:35:49.608
So I decided to include
some Mexican iconic songs

394
00:35:49.691 --> 00:35:52.986
that were already in the soundtrack
for Latin America.

395

What it all adds up into

396
00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:58.116
