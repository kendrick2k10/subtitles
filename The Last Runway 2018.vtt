BRAZIL. PONTA PORÃ

00:00:55.583 --> 00:00:56.416
WELCOME

00:00:58.666 --> 00:00:59.500
WELCOME

6
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.791
SENAD SPECIAL AGENT

7
00:01:46.208 --> 00:01:48.875
INSPIRED BY REAL EVENTS

8
00:01:58.916 --> 00:02:01.625
I can't even listen to the match in peace.

9
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.375
How are you doing?

10
00:02:09.708 --> 00:02:13.166
Come on. Lizard Face. please. untie him.

11
00:02:13.583 --> 00:02:14.666
Untie him!

12
00:02:20.416 --> 00:02:22.500
Look. Miranda. I'm sorry.

13
00:02:23.791 --> 00:02:25.833
We've seen each other. how many times now?

14
00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:28.458
Three. four times?

15
00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:32.750
And it seems to me that you're
a gentleman. a righteous man.

16
00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:36.375
I'm willing to make you an offer.

17
00:02:36.833 --> 00:02:40.000
I already told you I know nothing.

18
00:02:41.625 --> 00:02:46.208
I haven't even told you what I need.
I haven't asked you any questions yet.

19
00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:49.666
Look. let's work it out this way.

20
00:02:50.583 --> 00:02:53.833
I ask you something and you answer.

21
00:02:54.416 --> 00:02:55.250
Okay?

22
00:02:58.333 --> 00:02:59.166
Good.

23
00:02:59.458 --> 00:03:01.291
What's the name of the man...

24
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.000
leaking information to the police?

25
00:03:07.125 --> 00:03:10.958
There is someone.
but I don't know his name or...

26
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.541
who he's been talking to.

27
00:03:14.041 --> 00:03:15.916
He reaches out to us once a week.

28
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.625
but I swear to God I don't know who he is.

29
00:03:21.625 --> 00:03:23.583
That wasn't too hard. was it?

30
00:03:23.666 --> 00:03:25.875
You can go home now. let's go.

31
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:27.958
It's not enough.

32
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:31.625
Let's see.

33
00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:38.166
Let's talk about the future.

34
00:03:39.625 --> 00:03:41.208
but not yours or mine.

35
00:03:41.875 --> 00:03:43.291
Let's talk about her future.

36
00:03:48.875 --> 00:03:50.708
We know your child needs treatment.

37
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.375
And a father would do anything to save

38
00:03:54.458 --> 00:03:56.125
the life of his child. wouldn't he?

39
00:03:57.833 --> 00:04:00.625
We know you have to take her away
if you want to save her. right. daddy?

40
00:04:01.916 --> 00:04:02.791
To the States...

41
00:04:03.791 --> 00:04:05.333
-or Cuba.
-Cuba.

42
00:04:06.041 --> 00:04:09.583
I've sent people there
and they do have the best technology.

43
00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:13.250
We also know you don't have a dime.

44
00:04:15.625 --> 00:04:16.625
I'll pay for everything.

45
00:04:23.083 --> 00:04:25.541
Here's the ticket fare.

46
00:04:26.875 --> 00:04:28.791
This would be for housing.

47
00:04:29.833 --> 00:04:32.458
And all of these are the treatment costs.

48
00:04:33.875 --> 00:04:36.666
If money is the problem.
then it's already been solved.

49
00:04:37.541 --> 00:04:42.208
Miranda. I know you're loyal
to your people.

50
00:04:42.791 --> 00:04:44.500
and that goes a long way.

51
00:04:47.541 --> 00:04:49.916
But I think
the most important thing in life

52
00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:52.583
is family.

53
00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.541
You've been given the chance

54
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.625
to save the life of your daughter.

55
00:04:59.083 --> 00:05:00.916
All you have to do is give me a name.

56
00:05:02.083 --> 00:05:04.166
And tomorrow. your daughter
will be on her way to Cuba.

57
00:05:04.791 --> 00:05:06.125
The doctors are expecting her.

58
00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:10.125
There's something I don't get. you know?

59
00:05:10.833 --> 00:05:15.625
I'm supposed to be the drug trafficker.

60
00:05:17.291 --> 00:05:18.500
the son of a bitch.

61
00:05:19.166 --> 00:05:20.291
the killer.

62
00:05:21.666 --> 00:05:24.833
And you're supposed to be the good guy.

63
00:05:25.916 --> 00:05:29.458
but you're still not giving me a name.
Even if it means saving your child's life.

64
00:05:30.875 --> 00:05:32.833
Tell us the name. damn it! Shit!

65
00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:35.458
-Relax.
-Shit!

66
00:05:43.083 --> 00:05:45.083
-Julio.
-Come again?

67
00:05:48.041 --> 00:05:49.208
Julio Santana.

68
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.166
Julio Santana.
isn't that our man "Capote"?

69
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.166
He would talk about his mother.

70
00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.333
who's a patient at the IPS-Geriatric.

71
00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.416
He said he goes to visit her
once a week on Mondays.

72
00:06:05.708 --> 00:06:06.791
but it's all a lie.

73
00:06:08.083 --> 00:06:09.916
That's when he gets in touch with us.

74
00:06:18.208 --> 00:06:19.791
They're going to double-check that now.

75
00:06:21.166 --> 00:06:23.541
I'm so proud of you.

76
00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.041
Well done. Miranda.

77
00:06:27.208 --> 00:06:28.250
Well done. indeed.

78
00:06:33.875 --> 00:06:34.958
Oh. good!

79
00:06:35.833 --> 00:06:37.791
I love happy endings.

80
00:06:38.041 --> 00:06:40.250
Now this man will go to his house.

81
00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:42.750
pick up his daughter.
then straight to the airport.

82
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.083
Wait. you have to ask
for a special permission

83
00:06:48.458 --> 00:06:50.375
to leave work.

84
00:06:50.458 --> 00:06:53.666
Come on. give me a hug.

85
00:07:03.166 --> 00:07:04.000
Go.

86
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.333
Actually. change of plans. motherfucker.

87
00:07:46.875 --> 00:07:52.000
<i>-Red. 2. 99. Alpha. in position.
-Copy that. in position. Proceed.</i>

88
00:07:52.083 --> 00:07:53.000
Come on. guys.

89
00:08:02.916 --> 00:08:03.750
OPERATING DOCK

90
00:08:06.791 --> 00:08:08.166
Shit. the media are here!

91
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.750
What are they doing?
Come on. quick! Let's go!

92
00:08:16.875 --> 00:08:19.791
-Halt!
-Come on in. please. come on in.

93
00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:21.125
Come on in.

94
00:08:24.166 --> 00:08:26.083
-What's happening?
-We're waiting for you. please.

95
00:08:26.208 --> 00:08:28.708
-What is this?
-Please.

96
00:08:28.791 --> 00:08:29.625
What's going on?

97
00:08:29.791 --> 00:08:30.791
No press!

98
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:34.500
Ortiz. what's going on?

99
00:08:34.916 --> 00:08:38.166
I can't talk right now. please.
Please. leave.

100
00:08:41.458 --> 00:08:42.833
Ortiz. I said no press. shit!

101
00:08:42.916 --> 00:08:44.000
Vacate the premises!

102
00:08:44.083 --> 00:08:46.375
Clear the area now. damn it! Come on!

103
00:08:54.583 --> 00:08:55.958
<i>We'll continue our broadcast</i>

104
00:08:56.041 --> 00:08:57.583
<i>live nationwide.</i>

105
00:08:57.666 --> 00:08:59.875
<i>of what is considered
the greatest operation</i>

106
00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.000
<i>performed by SENAD agents this year.</i>

107
00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:04.000
<i>amidst their ongoing war
on drug trafficking.</i>

108
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.791
<i>However. we're sadly used to informing</i>

109
00:09:05.875 --> 00:09:08.041
<i>that they failed
and haven't found anything.</i>

110
00:09:08.125 --> 00:09:09.541
<i>Once again. our agents endure</i>

111
00:09:09.625 --> 00:09:11.750
<i>being mocked and ridiculed.</i>

112
00:09:11.833 --> 00:09:13.916
<i>We've been here since 6 a.m.</i>

113
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.916
<i>I'm going to turn around.
because I am hearing a lot of yelling...</i>

114
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.708
<i>The SENAD agents are actually brawling.</i>

115
00:09:19.791 --> 00:09:23.041
<i>apparently. due to their anger
and frustration.</i>

116
00:09:23.125 --> 00:09:25.125
<i>We are going to try to talk
to the agents...</i>

117
00:09:25.208 --> 00:09:29.125
-<i>later. but at this moment not...</i>
<i>-It's a shame.</i>

118
00:09:30.166 --> 00:09:31.208
Not again.

119
00:09:32.666 --> 00:09:34.083
They're a bunch of morons.

120
00:09:34.166 --> 00:09:37.375
<i>...from the SENAD in this warehouse...</i>

121
00:09:39.208 --> 00:09:41.208
The whole country is laughing at them.

122
00:09:41.291 --> 00:09:43.791
<i>They entered and found
a table full of snacks.</i>

123
00:09:44.583 --> 00:09:45.500
Ibañez?

124
00:09:46.541 --> 00:09:47.541
Holy shit!

125
00:09:47.625 --> 00:09:49.583
Not even Ibañez is exempted.

126
00:09:50.333 --> 00:09:52.750
Ibañez. they deceived you. boy!

127
00:09:52.833 --> 00:09:55.000
<i>We are going to stay here
for the rest of the day...</i>

128
00:09:55.666 --> 00:09:56.833
Shit.

129
00:09:57.791 --> 00:09:59.000
Motherfucker!

130
00:10:12.333 --> 00:10:13.625
NATIONAL ANTI-DRUG MINISTRY

131
00:10:26.208 --> 00:10:27.291
MINISTER OF THE SENAD

132
00:10:27.375 --> 00:10:31.250
Ibañez. that whole media stunt

133
00:10:31.333 --> 00:10:33.791
was a low. low blow.

134
00:10:34.541 --> 00:10:36.666
How is it possible for a piece of intel

135
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.000
to have been leaked like that?

136
00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.000
To make matters even worse.
you were brawling.

137
00:10:42.125 --> 00:10:43.916
You punched each other in public.

138
00:10:44.375 --> 00:10:45.666
It's a shame. Ibañez!

139
00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.333
You want to know
how the operation was leaked?

140
00:10:48.416 --> 00:10:49.458
Let's see!

141
00:10:49.541 --> 00:10:50.708
Once the operation was over.

142
00:10:50.791 --> 00:10:52.500
I asked everyone to hand me
their cellphones.

143
00:10:53.375 --> 00:10:55.333
It seems that everybody texted someone.

144
00:10:55.541 --> 00:10:57.750
revealing they're going home for dinner.

145
00:10:58.458 --> 00:11:00.875
Most of these numbers
are from burner phones.

146
00:11:02.333 --> 00:11:04.125
Some of them texted directly to the press.

147
00:11:04.208 --> 00:11:07.208
Everybody told someone else we were
going to execute this operation.

148
00:11:09.625 --> 00:11:11.666
Minister. this can't go on like this.

149
00:11:12.541 --> 00:11:13.958
and I'm not talking about me.

150
00:11:14.125 --> 00:11:16.291
this isn't about my reputation.

151
00:11:17.083 --> 00:11:18.666
They're all laughing at us. Minister.

152
00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.750
Public service is like that. Ibañez.

153
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:32.458
Sometimes you win. sometimes you lose.

154
00:11:32.541 --> 00:11:34.500
It's a bit like soccer. don't you get it?

155
00:11:35.083 --> 00:11:37.708
Some days our team can't score at all.

156
00:11:38.291 --> 00:11:40.708
and some others. they score from midfield.

157
00:11:41.375 --> 00:11:46.333
Maybe this time the informants failed us.

158
00:11:46.833 --> 00:11:51.541
but next time. we'll be successful.

159
00:11:52.416 --> 00:11:53.833
I'm not talking about an informer.

160
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:55.958
I'm not talking about a single snitch.

161
00:11:56.875 --> 00:12:00.333
I'm talking about all the force
being rotten to the core.

162
00:12:01.333 --> 00:12:03.625
Why don't we summon the press next time?

163
00:12:04.708 --> 00:12:07.125
So that we can prepare ourselves
to look good on camera.

164
00:12:11.375 --> 00:12:12.875
BORDERING DEPARTMENT

165
00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:13.833
PARAGUAY. BRAZIL

166
00:12:17.041 --> 00:12:18.541
Take care of him José. okay?

167
00:12:18.625 --> 00:12:21.625
He's your son. but he's my baby.

168
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.083
Angie. don't you worry.

169
00:12:26.541 --> 00:12:27.958
We're just going to work.

170
00:12:28.458 --> 00:12:30.500
It's his first trip with me and the boys.

171
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.833
If you have a problem with that.

172
00:12:32.916 --> 00:12:34.416
then we should let him decide.

173
00:12:35.458 --> 00:12:36.291
Seba.

174
00:12:37.666 --> 00:12:40.541
your mom and I
had always wanted you to study.

175
00:12:40.791 --> 00:12:42.416
Well. your mother a bit more than I.

176
00:12:43.416 --> 00:12:45.458
but you. what do you want?

177
00:12:45.708 --> 00:12:47.083
You want to stay at home?

178
00:12:47.208 --> 00:12:48.333
Or you want to come with me?

179
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:51.458
Mom. you know I don't like studying.

180
00:12:51.666 --> 00:12:54.125
Besides. what's better than going
to work with the old man?

181
00:12:54.666 --> 00:12:57.166
-Watch out. those people are dangerous.
-Seba.

182
00:12:58.291 --> 00:13:00.583
-this is for you.
-Are you out of your mind. José?

183
00:13:01.125 --> 00:13:04.791
-Is that really necessary?
-You either have the balls to carry it.

184
00:13:05.583 --> 00:13:07.458
or you better just shit in your pants.

185
00:13:08.458 --> 00:13:09.875
Bye. take care.

186
00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:13.708
Of course. I've got the balls. Dad.

187
00:13:24.125 --> 00:13:25.083
Hear me out. my friend.

188
00:13:25.916 --> 00:13:28.166
these guys already know
that we want more money.

189
00:13:29.416 --> 00:13:32.833
What they don't know is that we're
going to ask for a slice of cake.

190
00:13:32.916 --> 00:13:34.416
Understand? You know why?

191
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:37.625
Because that's
where the real money is. get it?

192
00:13:38.125 --> 00:13:40.416
If they refuse.
no more airstrips for them.

193
00:13:46.416 --> 00:13:48.625
Mendoza. why the hell
are we going this way?

194
00:13:48.916 --> 00:13:51.791
Because of the police. Sir.
the farmers are closing the roads...

195
00:13:51.875 --> 00:13:54.500
Police? Stop here. damn it!

196
00:14:22.125 --> 00:14:23.083
Fuck!

197
00:14:44.291 --> 00:14:45.500
What happened here?

198
00:14:50.083 --> 00:14:51.083
It's the son.

199
00:14:54.791 --> 00:14:56.666
What the hell happened. motherfucker?

200
00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:59.916
We didn't know. boss.

201
00:15:04.666 --> 00:15:05.833
And you. Turkish.

202
00:15:12.083 --> 00:15:13.916
You. move your ass.

203
00:15:36.666 --> 00:15:37.875
That's more like it.

204
00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:42.333
May I help you?

205
00:15:42.416 --> 00:15:45.291
Good morning. ma'am.
I'm looking for Colonel Fernandez.

206
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.875
Retired Colonel. you mean.

207
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:49.791
May I ask what this is about?

208
00:15:50.333 --> 00:15:51.500
Who wants to speak with him?

209
00:15:51.583 --> 00:15:53.958
My superiors want to have
a word with him. ma'am.

210
00:15:54.125 --> 00:15:56.583
He's quite busy at the moment.

211
00:15:57.125 --> 00:15:58.875
it has to be another day. boy.

212
00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.375
-Who is it. Elvira?
-Nobody. honey.

213
00:16:01.458 --> 00:16:04.541
Colonel. I am Lieutenant Basilio Aldana.

214
00:16:04.625 --> 00:16:09.625
Aldana. are you related
to Lieutenant Apolonio Aldana?

215
00:16:10.375 --> 00:16:11.666
He was my father. Colonel.

216
00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:13.416
You don't say...

217
00:16:14.666 --> 00:16:17.416
Your father was a great man.
and an even greater soldier.

218
00:16:19.458 --> 00:16:20.750
Thank you. Colonel.

219
00:16:22.166 --> 00:16:25.375
You are needed at the Armed Forces
headquarters. Colonel.

220
00:16:25.458 --> 00:16:27.208
The headquarters? Well. let's go!

221
00:16:27.291 --> 00:16:29.708
What? Why?

222
00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:32.958
You can't go looking like that.

223
00:16:33.041 --> 00:16:35.000
But it's an urgent matter!
Isn't it. Private?

224
00:16:35.083 --> 00:16:35.958
Affirmative. sir.

225
00:16:36.041 --> 00:16:37.041
See that. Elvira?

226
00:16:37.625 --> 00:16:38.625
-Let's go.
-Yes. sir.

227
00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.958
Oh my God. this man!

228
00:16:43.791 --> 00:16:45.791
You told me we were going
to the headquarters.

229
00:16:46.708 --> 00:16:47.750
Affirmative. Colonel.

230
00:16:48.625 --> 00:16:50.458
If that's the case.

231
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.791
then why are we making a detour?

232
00:16:56.291 --> 00:16:57.583
Aldana. do you hear me?

233
00:16:59.041 --> 00:17:00.750
I have orders to take you there. Colonel.

234
00:17:01.708 --> 00:17:03.208
Is the Air Conditioner working?

235
00:17:03.291 --> 00:17:05.291
Open the window. it's hot in here.

236
00:17:06.791 --> 00:17:08.291
Don't tease me. Private.

237
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.541
The only reason I won't shoot you
right now. is because of your father.

238
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.583
You're dealing with a Colonel here.

239
00:17:17.041 --> 00:17:18.916
Answer the question.
where are you taking me?

240
00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.875
We're already here. sir.

241
00:17:23.291 --> 00:17:26.083
GOVERNMENT PALACE

242
00:17:30.041 --> 00:17:33.083
Some of you might be thinking.

243
00:17:34.208 --> 00:17:35.791
"A bad penny always turns up."

244
00:17:37.125 --> 00:17:38.458
Just like I did. after many years.

245
00:17:39.208 --> 00:17:40.875
Here I oversee the SENAD.

246
00:17:41.541 --> 00:17:44.333
appointed by the President.

247
00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.791
I am thankful
for my predecessor's collaboration

248
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:50.083
to leave me his place.

249
00:17:50.583 --> 00:17:53.083
Let's see. all those who know who I am.
raise your hands.

250
00:17:56.125 --> 00:17:57.333
Aren't you...

251
00:17:57.416 --> 00:17:59.875
Special Agent Ibañez. at your disposal.

252
00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:02.166
What's wrong with you?
Why didn't you raise your hand?

253
00:18:02.625 --> 00:18:04.958
I didn't think it was needed. Minister.

254
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:08.041
Gentlemen. listen up.

255
00:18:09.041 --> 00:18:11.916
My first command is.
when we break formation.

256
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:16.083
everyone present takes a day off.

257
00:18:18.791 --> 00:18:22.416
Only guards on duty
shall remain in position.

258
00:18:23.916 --> 00:18:26.375
Starting tomorrow. we open a new chapter.

259
00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:29.750
I want all of you to be well-rested.

260
00:18:31.666 --> 00:18:33.750
Good afternoon. At ease.

261
00:18:38.791 --> 00:18:40.458
They told me you wanted to go take a leak.

262
00:18:40.916 --> 00:18:41.750
What?

263
00:18:42.125 --> 00:18:44.708
Go to the bathroom now.
wait until everyone is gone.

264
00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:45.875
And then come to my office.

265
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.625
-Understood?
-Yes. sir.

266
00:18:48.333 --> 00:18:49.458
Aldana. come with me.

267
00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.166
I don't trust anyone. boy.

268
00:18:57.291 --> 00:18:59.916
Some people are
either corrupt or incompetent.

269
00:19:00.833 --> 00:19:02.416
some people are both.

270
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:05.333
That last operation

271
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:07.791
was shameful.

272
00:19:08.625 --> 00:19:10.125
Quite embarrassing.

273
00:19:12.125 --> 00:19:15.541
I was in charge of that operation.
and I take full responsibility. sir.

274
00:19:15.833 --> 00:19:19.125
You were fooling around
live on national TV.

275
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.250
brawling in public.

276
00:19:21.708 --> 00:19:23.333
What the hell is wrong with you?

277
00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.458
Legally. sir. what needs to be done is

278
00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:29.041
to shuffle all the cards
and deal them all over again.

279
00:19:29.541 --> 00:19:31.791
Shuffle and deal the cards?
No way. Ibañez.

280
00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:34.000
What needs to be done
is ditch the whole batch

281
00:19:34.083 --> 00:19:35.666
and start all over again!

282
00:19:36.833 --> 00:19:39.583
I've already given an order to send
all of those who were responsible...

283
00:19:40.583 --> 00:19:42.708
to be in exile. I don't want them here.

284
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.083
I gave the order to Aldana.

285
00:19:45.625 --> 00:19:47.583
They'll be sent off
to Lagerenza or to the Chaco.

286
00:19:47.666 --> 00:19:50.208
anywhere else but here.
let them fry in the desert.

287
00:19:50.833 --> 00:19:51.875
That's okay. sir.

288
00:19:52.375 --> 00:19:54.791
I don't understand how we're
going to pull this off on our own.

289
00:19:55.208 --> 00:19:57.041
if you are sending
half the force to the desert.

290
00:19:58.208 --> 00:19:59.541
I have full clearance. Private.

291
00:20:00.541 --> 00:20:03.375
All of you are beneath me.
only the President stands above me.

292
00:20:04.166 --> 00:20:06.208
We are going to build a new force.

293
00:20:07.791 --> 00:20:10.791
It's time to recruit.

294
00:20:12.208 --> 00:20:13.416
And I know where to start.

295
00:20:15.708 --> 00:20:17.916
VIÑAS CUÉ JAIL
MILITARY PRISON

296
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.958
Halt! Who's there?

297
00:20:20.583 --> 00:20:22.083
Where do you think you two are going?

298
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.791
Show some respect. don't you realize

299
00:20:24.875 --> 00:20:26.833
you are talking to the new Minister
of SENAD here?

300
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.250
Great! Now we have some
old military geezer as Minister.

301
00:20:41.458 --> 00:20:45.916
Ibañez. I'd like to introduce you
to the worst sergeant in all history.

302
00:20:46.583 --> 00:20:47.916
and the best friend I've ever had.

303
00:20:48.208 --> 00:20:49.625
Command Sergeant Major Fariña.

304
00:20:50.083 --> 00:20:51.250
-Agent Ibañez.
-Fariña.

305
00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:53.916
Nice to meet you.
you don't have to be grumpy.

306
00:20:55.708 --> 00:20:57.208
Fariña is helping us with recruiting.

307
00:20:57.291 --> 00:21:02.000
It doesn't matter if they're veterans.
jarheads. or from another planet.

308
00:21:03.041 --> 00:21:05.375
What matters most
is that they have to be good people.

309
00:21:05.791 --> 00:21:07.875
Understood. Fariña? Loyal people.

310
00:21:12.125 --> 00:21:14.125
-Inmate Gorostiaga.
-Colonel.

311
00:21:15.416 --> 00:21:16.291
At ease.

312
00:21:22.125 --> 00:21:24.208
What is your problem with Agent Ibañez?

313
00:21:25.791 --> 00:21:29.250
I don't have any issues
with Agent Ibañez. Colonel.

314
00:21:30.041 --> 00:21:34.166
Though he was in charge of intel
in an embarrassing operation.

315
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.166
I regretfully took part of it recently.

316
00:21:38.625 --> 00:21:40.750
apart from that.
I don't have any issues with Ibañez.

317
00:21:41.583 --> 00:21:44.666
Yes. that operation
reflected poorly on all of us.

318
00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:46.708
That's why we're here.

319
00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:51.000
I'm here because I broke
Lieutenant Colonel Ortiz's face.

320
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.791
Are you here for the same reason?

321
00:21:53.875 --> 00:21:57.083
Don't be a smart-ass. Gorostiaga.
show some respect. damn it.

322
00:21:57.166 --> 00:22:00.333
Your file tells me
you're not a bad soldier.

323
00:22:00.416 --> 00:22:04.666
Quite the opposite.
you graduated the academy with honors.

324
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:08.166
Instructed by the U.S. Army.

325
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.916
Certified by the Navy SEALs.

326
00:22:11.041 --> 00:22:14.333
Studied in Brazil. Bolivia. Colombia.

327
00:22:16.416 --> 00:22:19.333
It seems that your only problem
is dealing with authority.

328
00:22:21.125 --> 00:22:24.583
From a soldier to another.
and with all due respect. Colonel...

329
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.166
When those in command can't feel shame.

330
00:22:27.291 --> 00:22:29.416
one tends to lose respect for authority.

331
00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.625
That's not the proper attitude.

332
00:22:35.875 --> 00:22:37.208
And that's why we chose you.

333
00:22:38.208 --> 00:22:41.666
Can I know exactly what you
chose me for. Colonel?

334
00:22:44.916 --> 00:22:48.125
Do you like being screwed by those

335
00:22:48.208 --> 00:22:50.750
damn narcs like they've
been doing for such a long time?

336
00:22:51.875 --> 00:22:54.583
Aren't you tired of losing
over and over again?

337
00:22:54.833 --> 00:22:57.625
Or is it that you only have balls
to hit a useless superior?

338
00:22:57.708 --> 00:23:01.541
You don't need balls or brains for that.

339
00:23:03.291 --> 00:23:04.500
It's not a matter of balls.

340
00:23:05.375 --> 00:23:06.708
it is a sense of what is right.

341
00:23:07.791 --> 00:23:09.250
and as long as someone disrespects

342
00:23:09.333 --> 00:23:11.708
a member of my unit or myself.

343
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:16.625
I won't hesitate to retaliate. sir.

344
00:23:16.708 --> 00:23:17.791
Are you insane?

345
00:23:18.583 --> 00:23:19.958
I am crazier than you.

346
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:24.083
be thankful that I'm not teaching
you a lesson right now.

347
00:23:25.708 --> 00:23:27.833
What's your damn problem?
You got trust issues?

348
00:23:30.125 --> 00:23:32.958
Colonel. I only trust people
who speak right to my face.

349
00:23:33.916 --> 00:23:35.708
like what you're doing right now.

350
00:23:36.958 --> 00:23:39.541
The rest of them. I don't care.

351
00:23:41.208 --> 00:23:43.750
That's precisely
the attitude I'm looking for.

352
00:23:45.625 --> 00:23:48.625
You're going to work
hand in hand with Ibañez.

353
00:23:48.708 --> 00:23:51.416
You'll create a new Special Ops Unit.

354
00:23:52.833 --> 00:23:53.791
and you'll be in charge.

355
00:23:56.375 --> 00:23:59.666
All of us will stand before God's Justice.

356
00:24:00.083 --> 00:24:01.375
For it is written.

357
00:24:01.958 --> 00:24:06.250
"As surely as I live. says the Lord.
every knee will bow before me.

358
00:24:06.791 --> 00:24:08.833
and every tongue will confess
and give praise to God.

359
00:24:09.208 --> 00:24:13.125
so then. each of us will give
an account of ourselves to God."

360
00:24:14.125 --> 00:24:16.500
-The word of God.
-We praise thee. Lord.

361
00:24:22.583 --> 00:24:27.333
Angelita. I want you to know
that I'll always be here for you.

362
00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:32.375
And your family will always
be well taken care of.

363
00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.166
My family is buried in the ground.

364
00:24:38.666 --> 00:24:42.125
All they need is peace now.

365
00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:52.083
RANCHING GROUP

366
00:24:52.166 --> 00:24:56.375
ASSAD FAMILY

367
00:25:02.416 --> 00:25:04.000
Let's pretend that that's the only

368
00:25:04.083 --> 00:25:06.125
dirt you threw at my family.

369
00:25:08.208 --> 00:25:10.000
It's not my fault they're dead.

370
00:25:11.041 --> 00:25:12.541
but it is my burden they're not alive.

371
00:25:14.916 --> 00:25:18.791
Don't try to fool me. Salcedo.
I know how things really are.

372
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000
I don't want you to be alone.
that's not good for anyone.

373
00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:32.875
I pray to the Virgin Mary.
so that she may guide you.

374
00:25:35.958 --> 00:25:41.250
and you finally find the right path.

375
00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:24.791
I like my coffee black with no sugar.

376
00:26:31.625 --> 00:26:33.708
What a player our boss is. my friend!

377
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.958
The bodies of Assad
and his son are still fresh in the grave.

378
00:26:37.041 --> 00:26:40.625
and the guy is already
screwing the widow there.

379
00:26:41.833 --> 00:26:43.375
That's why I always say. my friend.

380
00:26:43.875 --> 00:26:45.583
women are not human beings.

381
00:26:45.833 --> 00:26:47.375
You have to pay attention.

382
00:26:47.916 --> 00:26:49.500
You have to be really careful.

383
00:26:50.125 --> 00:26:54.291
or they'll leave you and not long after.
they'll be with another guy.

384
00:26:54.458 --> 00:26:57.291
I have lots of experience with women.

385
00:26:58.375 --> 00:26:59.291
Here comes the boss.

386
00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:23.541
Dude. you're out! Go home. buddy.

387
00:27:24.333 --> 00:27:27.375
Fariña. these four guys
you brought me are useless.

388
00:27:27.458 --> 00:27:30.833
I found them all in five minutes.
They're a bunch of amateurs.

389
00:27:31.041 --> 00:27:31.875
Is this all you got?

390
00:27:31.958 --> 00:27:33.833
No serious candidate to show me?

391
00:27:34.833 --> 00:27:36.583
Four? I chose five.

392
00:27:36.958 --> 00:27:38.000
Five?

393
00:27:44.916 --> 00:27:47.833
There's the fifth one.
You missed that one. buddy.

394
00:27:50.458 --> 00:27:52.916
Private. get up and say your name.

395
00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:58.208
What's wrong. Private?
Do you even speak Spanish?

396
00:27:59.958 --> 00:28:01.208
He's telling you to come out.

397
00:28:04.333 --> 00:28:07.125
He understands Spanish. but it's better
to speak to him in Guaraní.

398
00:28:13.333 --> 00:28:14.541
Permission to speak. sir!

399
00:28:15.125 --> 00:28:16.500
Sniper Chamorro. at your command!

400
00:28:16.583 --> 00:28:17.583
Very well. Chamorro.

401
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.750
Private. introduce yourself.

402
00:29:03.833 --> 00:29:05.125
Sergeant Ayala. Captain. sir.

403
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:07.583
But all my comrades know me as "Shakes."

404
00:29:12.583 --> 00:29:14.291
How come you shoot like that. Shakes?

405
00:29:14.916 --> 00:29:16.708
Everybody asks me that. Captain. sir.

406
00:29:17.333 --> 00:29:19.791
the trembling is gone the moment
I put my finger on the trigger.

407
00:29:22.166 --> 00:29:24.125
So. you have a problem. soldier.

408
00:29:25.708 --> 00:29:28.291
Just a nuisance. sir.

409
00:29:30.875 --> 00:29:34.583
This is a good soldier. he's crazy.
but he's the best we've got.

410
00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:36.208
At ease. Shakes.

411
00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:38.958
This one's coming with us. Fariña.

412
00:29:39.291 --> 00:29:40.166
Yes. sir.

413
00:30:04.541 --> 00:30:07.458
Fariña. who's our guy here?

414
00:30:09.458 --> 00:30:11.708
Russian. come here.

415
00:30:19.916 --> 00:30:22.208
This one looks like he has
a few screws loose. Fariña.

416
00:30:28.458 --> 00:30:30.125
Let's see. Russian. show the Captain.

417
00:30:32.958 --> 00:30:36.291
Trust me. Captain.
we're going to need this one.

418
00:30:43.916 --> 00:30:45.541
Amazing. blondie!

419
00:30:46.666 --> 00:30:48.083
May I go on. Sergeant?

420
00:30:50.333 --> 00:30:51.625
He's strong!

421
00:30:54.041 --> 00:30:57.208
NATIONAL ANTI-DRUG MINISTRY
ASUNCIÓN HEADQUARTERS

422
00:31:22.125 --> 00:31:23.833
-Gorostiaga.
-What?

423
00:31:24.041 --> 00:31:26.583
This team of yours
doesn't look too disciplined.

424
00:31:27.875 --> 00:31:29.625
These new guys
you brought here for example.

425
00:31:29.708 --> 00:31:30.916
what do you know about them?

426
00:31:32.916 --> 00:31:35.916
They're young. recently graduated.

427
00:31:37.333 --> 00:31:38.708
and they're not corrupted.

428
00:31:40.458 --> 00:31:42.625
Furthermore. they are highly recommended.

429
00:31:43.666 --> 00:31:47.583
the only one I know
from way back is Espínola.

430
00:31:57.791 --> 00:31:58.666
What is this?

431
00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:00.833
I found something important.

432
00:32:01.708 --> 00:32:03.375
I thought I'd made myself clear.

433
00:32:03.916 --> 00:32:05.625
when I asked you for the transcriptions.

434
00:32:06.291 --> 00:32:07.333
Three copies each.

435
00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:11.375
I just wanted to save time and paper.
The data in there is very important.

436
00:32:12.958 --> 00:32:14.041
Look. miss.

437
00:32:15.083 --> 00:32:16.791
I get this is your first week at work.

438
00:32:16.958 --> 00:32:19.583
but it's time someone explains to you
how we run things around here.

439
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.333
That guy over there is Ibañez.

440
00:32:22.416 --> 00:32:25.458
he is our boss.
he gives me an order and I follow it.

441
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:30.333
because he is my superior.
Same thing applies to you.

442
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.041
When I give you an order.
you must follow it at once.

443
00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:35.000
Because I outrank you.

444
00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:36.416
Understood?

445
00:32:44.208 --> 00:32:46.583
Sir. can I talk to you for a second?

446
00:32:46.666 --> 00:32:47.500
Yes.

447
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.791
Did you not hear what I just told you?

448
00:32:51.416 --> 00:32:53.875
I'm Agent Jara.
I've got something to inform you. sir.

449
00:32:54.833 --> 00:32:55.666
Betty. am I right?

450
00:32:57.708 --> 00:33:01.375
Well. Betty. I realize you're not very
used to the chain of command.

451
00:33:02.125 --> 00:33:03.708
I'm sorry to tell you that here at SENAD.

452
00:33:03.791 --> 00:33:05.875
everything flows
through the chain of command.

453
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.458
I thought we already talked about it.

454
00:33:08.541 --> 00:33:10.625
Yes. sir. understood.

455
00:33:10.916 --> 00:33:14.125
However. you also said
that if the information was urgent.

456
00:33:14.333 --> 00:33:16.000
you'd rather get it as fast as possible.

457
00:33:16.083 --> 00:33:18.666
What could be so urgent
that shouldn't go through me first?

458
00:33:21.458 --> 00:33:23.166
Let's see. I translated all the words

459
00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:26.791
that are different in meaning and usage.

460
00:33:26.875 --> 00:33:29.708
which implies a phrase could have
several meanings simultaneously.

461
00:33:29.791 --> 00:33:32.333
depending on who's talking
or to whom it is intended.

462
00:33:32.416 --> 00:33:33.541
Some copies are missing here.

463
00:33:34.375 --> 00:33:36.666
I found expressions
and slangs in these recordings

464
00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:40.000
which. depending on their origins.
could mean something totally different.

465
00:33:40.083 --> 00:33:42.083
I translated from Guaraní.
Portuguese. "Portuñol".

466
00:33:42.166 --> 00:33:43.916
I wrote down
all the possible meanings. I also

467
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.791
-rebuilt parts of the information...
-Agent.

468
00:33:45.875 --> 00:33:47.041
...that were inaudible.

469
00:33:47.125 --> 00:33:48.416
-I also found something...
-Agent.

470
00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.416
that seems to be important enough
for you to know.

471
00:33:50.833 --> 00:33:52.250
Go do your job.

472
00:33:52.583 --> 00:33:55.500
-It's an order.
-Juan. shut up for a second. my friend.

473
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.416
Betty. stop blabbering.
what's the information?

474
00:34:01.125 --> 00:34:02.916
In two nights. all the phones

475
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.541
that we have bugged
will meet at the same place.

476
00:34:49.625 --> 00:34:51.583
Everyone on the ground!

477
00:34:51.666 --> 00:34:54.125
On the ground. damn it!

478
00:34:54.666 --> 00:34:56.916
On the ground! Clear!

479
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:57.833
Clear!

480
00:34:57.916 --> 00:34:59.041
Everything clear!

481
00:34:59.125 --> 00:35:00.250
Last room!

482
00:35:00.333 --> 00:35:03.375
Impressive. a very thorough work.

483
00:35:03.458 --> 00:35:06.166
There should be more women
in this building.

484
00:35:06.416 --> 00:35:08.208
Did they give the coordinates
of the meeting?

485
00:35:08.291 --> 00:35:10.000
How many languages do you speak?
Six. seven?

486
00:35:10.416 --> 00:35:12.083
I don't understand why they'd all meet.

487
00:35:12.166 --> 00:35:14.000
How did you learn so many languages?

488
00:35:14.291 --> 00:35:15.791
Did they talk about an informant?

489
00:35:15.875 --> 00:35:17.041
Can I ask you something?

490
00:35:18.625 --> 00:35:20.750
One at a time. please.

491
00:35:22.416 --> 00:35:25.000
They're going to meet at Assad's Ranch.

492
00:35:25.958 --> 00:35:28.125
I speak 5 languages.
but I can understand 8.

493
00:35:28.833 --> 00:35:30.166
It seems to be a wedding.

494
00:35:30.583 --> 00:35:33.041
I don't think it'd be the widow's.
because she's still grieving.

495
00:35:33.666 --> 00:35:36.583
I had to learn. sir. or else
I would miss out on everything.

496
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.333
No. Ibañez.
they didn't mention an informant.

497
00:35:40.666 --> 00:35:42.375
Why did you accept this job?

498
00:35:43.458 --> 00:35:45.375
Actually.
I applied for a job at the UN. sir.

499
00:35:45.833 --> 00:35:47.208
but they didn't call back yet.

500
00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:48.875
I have to work.

501
00:35:49.291 --> 00:35:51.750
my parents aren't here anymore
and I live with my sick grandpa.

502
00:35:51.833 --> 00:35:52.875
I didn't have a choice.

503
00:35:54.041 --> 00:35:59.750
Betty. do you know who's talking here?
Who's he talking to?

504
00:36:02.333 --> 00:36:04.458
I can't figure it out
just with the voices.

505
00:36:04.833 --> 00:36:08.916
It would be nice to be able to link
everything I listen to with their faces.

506
00:36:09.291 --> 00:36:11.708
That's the only way I could link
all the conversations.

507
00:36:18.458 --> 00:36:19.708
Can I ask you something?

508
00:36:23.208 --> 00:36:26.125
What if you send someone to that wedding?

509
00:36:27.291 --> 00:36:30.375
Listen to this. it's a wedding.

510
00:36:30.666 --> 00:36:32.583
you have guests at weddings.

511
00:36:33.958 --> 00:36:37.791
Maybe you could pose as guests.

512
00:36:38.125 --> 00:36:39.708
and I could go with you.

513
00:36:40.291 --> 00:36:42.791
That's the only way I'm going
to understand the recordings.

514
00:36:42.875 --> 00:36:45.875
I need to see their faces
and match them to their voices.

515
00:36:45.958 --> 00:36:47.375
I am certain this will work.

516
00:36:47.458 --> 00:36:51.208
Betty. look. we are really proud
of your work here.

517
00:36:52.083 --> 00:36:55.000
but you're talking about a job
meant for field agents.

518
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:56.833
Not for an analyst.

519
00:36:57.291 --> 00:37:02.583
But it's a wedding.
people go to weddings with a date.

520
00:37:02.666 --> 00:37:04.708
Isn't that right?
Would you rather go alone?

521
00:37:05.833 --> 00:37:09.333
If I go as your date.
we'll save us a lot of time.

522
00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:12.875
You are totally nuts. Ibañez.

523
00:37:12.958 --> 00:37:15.916
No way. it's an unnecessary risk.

524
00:37:17.208 --> 00:37:19.416
Of course. it's risky.
like everything else we do here.

525
00:37:20.666 --> 00:37:22.666
The thing is.
we'll be able to gather so much intel.

526
00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:24.958
we'll save so much time.
That's what this is all about.

527
00:37:25.333 --> 00:37:28.375
There's no way I'm going to have
a civilian under my command.

528
00:37:28.666 --> 00:37:30.625
she's not trained.
she's not a field agent.

529
00:37:30.708 --> 00:37:33.041
I cannot be responsible
for whatever may happen out there.

530
00:37:33.541 --> 00:37:35.666
I don't know why we're wasting time
arguing about this.

531
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.958
You don't even have a plan
to get us in. do you?

532
00:37:38.958 --> 00:37:40.208
I do have a plan.

533
00:37:41.083 --> 00:37:43.958
Betty figured out
who's going to perform that night.

534
00:37:45.625 --> 00:37:46.833
Guess who's playing?

535
00:38:30.375 --> 00:38:31.208
Dickheads!

536
00:38:31.541 --> 00:38:32.916
Motherfuckers! Idiots!

537
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.708
I can't rehearse like that. man!

538
00:38:34.791 --> 00:38:36.208
I can't do it!

539
00:38:36.458 --> 00:38:39.333
Asshole. you're not on the right key!
What's wrong with you?

540
00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:42.375
You. my friend.
put the sandwiches down. moron.

541
00:38:42.958 --> 00:38:45.291
Come on. if we play like this live.
they're going to kill us.

542
00:38:45.583 --> 00:38:48.541
Stupid idiots! I am Roberto Vallejos.
step up. you fucking morons.

543
00:38:48.625 --> 00:38:50.750
There are only three fucking chords!
Come on!

544
00:38:52.875 --> 00:38:56.125
I'm going to go take a break now.
and when I come back

545
00:38:56.375 --> 00:38:58.333
you better play it right!

546
00:38:58.416 --> 00:39:00.875
No mistakes. got it?

547
00:39:01.208 --> 00:39:03.958
Got it. you idiot? Wake up. motherfucker!

548
00:39:06.625 --> 00:39:08.000
What are you looking at. asshole?

549
00:39:08.666 --> 00:39:11.458
Here. shove it right up your ass.
let's see if it wakes you up.

550
00:39:13.791 --> 00:39:16.416
They're a bunch of retarded morons.
I'm going to kick their asses

551
00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:17.750
and get myself a new band.

552
00:39:18.083 --> 00:39:20.375
Roberto Vallejos. it's me
and my music. damn it.

553
00:39:27.166 --> 00:39:28.291
Where did I leave my joints?

554
00:39:28.375 --> 00:39:29.666
I know I had some stashed here.

555
00:39:46.291 --> 00:39:47.541
Thought you were a cop.

556
00:39:49.416 --> 00:39:50.708
You scared me. Want some?

557
00:39:52.708 --> 00:39:56.375
Special Agent Ibañez. narcotics.

558
00:40:04.333 --> 00:40:07.291
He is Captain Gorostiaga. Special Ops.

559
00:40:07.583 --> 00:40:08.541
Hi.

560
00:40:10.458 --> 00:40:12.833
Mr. Vallejos. big fan of yours.

561
00:40:12.916 --> 00:40:15.250
-Really?
-No. not a chance.

562
00:40:17.333 --> 00:40:19.791
EVERY SATURDAY PARTY

563
00:40:25.041 --> 00:40:26.375
This is medicinal.

564
00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:36.166
Are you going out. honey?

565
00:40:37.666 --> 00:40:39.916
I told you it's only for work. Grandpa.

566
00:40:42.708 --> 00:40:45.708
You're so jealous. Grandpa.
Were you like this with my mother too?

567
00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:49.875
Yes. I used to scare
the hell out of your father.

568
00:40:50.791 --> 00:40:55.916
Whenever he called and I picked up.
he would immediately hang up.

569
00:40:56.125 --> 00:40:57.833
He was scared of me.

570
00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:05.125
I don't like that you work
at nights. honey.

571
00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:07.875
What are you doing lately?

572
00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:11.625
The only job I know
that is done at night is...

573
00:41:11.708 --> 00:41:14.500
Enough. Grandpa. you got it all wrong.

574
00:41:14.583 --> 00:41:16.541
I already told you I'm going to a wedding.

575
00:41:16.875 --> 00:41:20.250
I'm going with a coworker.
his cousin is getting hitched.

576
00:41:20.333 --> 00:41:22.541
Things haven't really changed
that much from your time.

577
00:41:22.625 --> 00:41:23.791
guys still ask girls out

578
00:41:23.875 --> 00:41:25.625
to go to weddings.

579
00:41:27.708 --> 00:41:29.250
Are you dating your boss?

580
00:41:30.291 --> 00:41:33.125
If he's married. he'll fool you.

581
00:41:33.208 --> 00:41:36.333
he'll tell you he's going
to leave his family for you.

582
00:41:36.416 --> 00:41:37.791
Grandpa!

583
00:41:38.041 --> 00:41:41.000
Don't get into trouble. darling.

584
00:41:42.125 --> 00:41:43.416
Leave him.

585
00:41:43.583 --> 00:41:46.958
Enough. Grandpa. I'm not dating

586
00:41:47.041 --> 00:41:49.666
my boss or anyone else.

587
00:41:49.833 --> 00:41:52.250
You also know that in case I get married.

588
00:41:52.333 --> 00:41:54.791
and have a thousand kids.
you're coming to live with me.

589
00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:57.666
Take care. sweetie.

590
00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:03.125
Don't worry. I'll stay out of trouble.

591
00:42:39.958 --> 00:42:41.250
Good evening. ladies.

592
00:42:41.333 --> 00:42:43.291
Are you having a good time? Thanks. man.

593
00:42:45.791 --> 00:42:47.500
Excuse me. boss. Everything okay?

594
00:42:47.833 --> 00:42:49.541
Guests are arriving and I want to know

595
00:42:49.625 --> 00:42:52.750
if you want any special attention
for any of them.

596
00:42:53.083 --> 00:42:56.333
-You have to relax.
-Have a good time. drink some rum.

597
00:42:56.416 --> 00:42:57.958
fuck a girl. I don't know.

598
00:42:58.041 --> 00:43:00.750
want some blow? Whatever you want.

599
00:43:00.833 --> 00:43:01.916
this is a party!

600
00:43:02.625 --> 00:43:04.750
Thank you. boss.
I'll make a toast for you.

601
00:43:05.041 --> 00:43:05.958
Excuse me.

602
00:43:06.458 --> 00:43:08.375
I don't know why you keep this rat alive.

603
00:43:09.416 --> 00:43:11.375
He's lucky he's alive. motherfucker.

604
00:43:11.458 --> 00:43:13.833
Never let him know what you really think.

605
00:43:14.333 --> 00:43:15.583
There's no point in killing him.

606
00:43:16.041 --> 00:43:18.041
Let's just give some meaning to his life.

607
00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:22.583
Where's your girl?

608
00:43:23.166 --> 00:43:24.125
Only God knows.

609
00:43:26.791 --> 00:43:29.708
Mom. please.
I don't want to do this. please.

610
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.250
I'd rather kill myself.

611
00:43:33.083 --> 00:43:34.458
Kill yourself. María José?

612
00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:38.958
They killed your dad. your brother.
they took everything from us.

613
00:43:40.291 --> 00:43:42.750
Look at me. every time you open your legs.

614
00:43:43.041 --> 00:43:44.541
I want you to think of one thing only.

615
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:45.666
Revenge.

616
00:43:48.291 --> 00:43:49.833
Because it is written. María José.

617
00:43:50.083 --> 00:43:51.666
blood is paid with blood.

618
00:43:56.208 --> 00:44:00.583
Look. You will be able
to do it to her every day.

619
00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:04.208
-Do you like her?
-What a woman. Come on. go.

620
00:44:07.416 --> 00:44:10.708
I thought you backed down from this.

621
00:44:11.416 --> 00:44:13.250
Like we had that chance.

622
00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:16.541
You smell so good. darling.

623
00:44:17.416 --> 00:44:20.583
I can't believe what you're doing to me.
I just can't. I can't believe it.

624
00:44:20.875 --> 00:44:24.000
Not only is my life at risk now.
but also my reputation.

625
00:44:24.083 --> 00:44:26.541
I am Roberto Vallejos. proud Argentinian.
I can't believe this.

626
00:44:26.625 --> 00:44:28.416
you are nuts. completely nuts.

627
00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:31.041
You can't give me any woman
to pretend she's my girlfriend.

628
00:44:31.125 --> 00:44:32.750
No man. you're wrong.

629
00:44:33.041 --> 00:44:34.125
Look at this place.

630
00:44:34.541 --> 00:44:36.666
I can't even imagine
what kind of woman lives inside.

631
00:44:37.208 --> 00:44:39.208
You screwed me. screwed me really bad.

632
00:44:39.291 --> 00:44:40.666
I'm going to be in every newspaper.

633
00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:42.333
Please. shut up.

634
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:44.625
Please. shut the fuck up!

635
00:44:48.375 --> 00:44:49.458
-Want some?
-Yes.

636
00:44:50.958 --> 00:44:52.208
What are you doing? Are you mad?

637
00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:05.666
-Roberto Vallejos. in the flesh.
-Yes.

638
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:07.291
I've heard a lot about you.

639
00:45:07.375 --> 00:45:08.333
Yes. I get that a lot.

640
00:45:08.416 --> 00:45:10.458
Maybe because of my hit songs.

641
00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:12.083
<i>Inside</i>

642
00:45:12.166 --> 00:45:13.833
Yes. I've heard the recordings.

643
00:45:13.916 --> 00:45:15.875
you're always talking to your friends.

644
00:45:15.958 --> 00:45:18.208
buying drugs all the time.

645
00:45:18.333 --> 00:45:20.500
That's what I told Ibañez and Gorostiaga.

646
00:45:20.583 --> 00:45:25.083
"Everyone says Roberto Vallejos
smokes the best weed in the country."

647
00:45:25.583 --> 00:45:26.750
I get that a lot too.

648
00:45:27.083 --> 00:45:28.625
Can you take a picture of us?

649
00:45:29.916 --> 00:45:30.750
Here.

650
00:45:37.333 --> 00:45:38.416
Let's take a better selfie.

651
00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:42.500
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

652
00:45:43.166 --> 00:45:46.291
So. you're a cumbia fan?
Cool! Betty. right?

653
00:45:48.583 --> 00:45:51.166
Don't fool me. Gorostiaga.
you know my name.

654
00:45:51.541 --> 00:45:54.083
You know nothing about me. though.

655
00:45:56.416 --> 00:45:57.291
Hey.

656
00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:02.583
try these on.

657
00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:05.875
Betty. what are you doing here?
This is too dangerous.

658
00:46:06.916 --> 00:46:09.125
This is an intel mission. Gorostiaga.

659
00:46:09.208 --> 00:46:10.083
Intel?

660
00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:14.583
You'll wear these glasses.
you look smart with them.

661
00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:18.375
There's a camera in the middle.
everything you see. we see. Got that?

662
00:46:18.916 --> 00:46:20.500
I'll be careful where to look.

663
00:46:20.583 --> 00:46:23.041
Yes. try not to stare at me all the time.

664
00:46:23.125 --> 00:46:26.083
I know I look good in this suit.
but behave yourself.

665
00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:31.041
I can tell it's rented.

666
00:46:39.541 --> 00:46:40.375
Take care.

667
00:46:43.666 --> 00:46:45.166
Come on in.

668
00:46:50.375 --> 00:46:51.875
Salcedo. my friend!

669
00:46:52.291 --> 00:46:54.208
My favorite artist.

670
00:46:55.166 --> 00:46:57.708
-Looking good!
-Thank you very much.

671
00:46:57.791 --> 00:46:59.541
Ma'am. how are you doing?
It's my pleasure.

672
00:47:00.125 --> 00:47:02.166
Roberto Vallejos. proud Argentinian.

673
00:47:05.291 --> 00:47:08.250
Betty. Betty is...

674
00:47:08.333 --> 00:47:10.750
-I'm his girlfriend. since not long ago.
-My girlfriend. yes.

675
00:47:10.833 --> 00:47:12.291
How are you? Nice to meet you.

676
00:47:12.375 --> 00:47:16.916
-We love each other.
-It's my pleasure. you are beautiful.

677
00:47:17.708 --> 00:47:18.625
How are you?

678
00:47:20.416 --> 00:47:23.916
Come on. man.
Are you playing for us or what?

679
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.708
Go there. sing and dance.
I'll take care of this beauty if you want.

680
00:47:26.791 --> 00:47:31.041
-Really? But...
-There's no need. I love parties.

681
00:47:31.125 --> 00:47:33.166
particularly the ones
where I don't know anybody.

682
00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:35.666
one can only guess
how it's all going to end.

683
00:47:36.416 --> 00:47:39.291
-My love. play one for me. okay?
-Exactly.

684
00:47:40.291 --> 00:47:42.291
-Okay.
-Excuse me.

685
00:47:43.916 --> 00:47:45.916
You are a lucky man.

686
00:47:46.708 --> 00:47:50.083
if that woman cooks like she walks.

687
00:47:51.083 --> 00:47:52.750
I'd eat her up...

688
00:48:04.458 --> 00:48:07.916
That's Anibal. I recognized
him from the recordings.

689
00:48:09.041 --> 00:48:12.875
I think he works at the Chaco region.
to be honest. I'm not really sure yet.

690
00:48:20.291 --> 00:48:24.083
That's little Braulio.
I thought he was taller.

691
00:48:25.583 --> 00:48:27.208
He and Salcedo hate each other.

692
00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:29.958
The thing is. they need each other.

693
00:48:36.958 --> 00:48:38.833
Tell me something. Salcedo.

694
00:48:39.541 --> 00:48:42.375
now that he's married to Assad's daughter.

695
00:48:43.625 --> 00:48:45.166
does that mean you own the airstrips?

696
00:48:47.291 --> 00:48:48.500
It's getting fishy in here.

697
00:48:49.666 --> 00:48:53.875
Little Braulio.
you can call it whatever you like.

698
00:48:54.375 --> 00:48:57.000
the only thing I'm telling you
from now on.

699
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.666
is that your family
and mine are going to do better

700
00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:02.500
business than our fathers did.

701
00:49:03.291 --> 00:49:06.041
Hold on a moment. Salcedo.

702
00:49:08.541 --> 00:49:10.583
I already paid Assad everything.

703
00:49:11.625 --> 00:49:13.500
I have to pay you now?

704
00:49:15.375 --> 00:49:16.833
Have you lost your mind?

705
00:49:19.083 --> 00:49:21.958
I was thinking about a new business model.

706
00:49:24.958 --> 00:49:31.541
from now on. 50% of everything
going through my airstrips is mine.

707
00:49:31.625 --> 00:49:32.875
Are you nuts?

708
00:49:42.166 --> 00:49:45.750
You either take that or you can land
at the Pettirossi Airport.

709
00:49:55.375 --> 00:49:57.416
All of the guys you see here

710
00:49:58.375 --> 00:49:59.666
are fighting each other to see

711
00:50:00.083 --> 00:50:02.750
who's the new "Master of the skies".

712
00:50:04.125 --> 00:50:07.250
I'm telling you. Salcedo has already won.

713
00:50:09.291 --> 00:50:11.166
You know what bothers me the most?

714
00:50:11.958 --> 00:50:14.416
Salcedo let us see them
like he doesn't care.

715
00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:15.333
Why?

716
00:50:16.166 --> 00:50:19.500
Are we that useless to him
that he doesn't care about what we know?

717
00:50:21.833 --> 00:50:24.541
Nice party. right?

718
00:50:26.083 --> 00:50:28.458
Very nice. sir. congratulations.

719
00:50:29.125 --> 00:50:30.458
Well. thank you.

720
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:33.791
So. you work with Roberto?

721
00:50:33.875 --> 00:50:35.583
Mr. Roberto is my boss. yes.

722
00:50:36.041 --> 00:50:39.083
Good. wouldn't you like a change of air?

723
00:50:39.208 --> 00:50:40.708
I mean. to work under me.

724
00:50:41.416 --> 00:50:42.666
A very generous offer.

725
00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:45.541
but I'm loyal to Mr. Vallejos.

726
00:50:45.625 --> 00:50:46.500
he's good to me.

727
00:50:47.458 --> 00:50:49.666
No. asshole.
I'm not talking about Vallejos.

728
00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:51.958
I'm talking about Minister Fernandez.

729
00:50:52.041 --> 00:50:55.125
I've got a long list
of people working for me on the inside.

730
00:50:55.458 --> 00:50:56.625
they all work for me

731
00:50:56.708 --> 00:51:00.083
and I give them some serious cash.

732
00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:01.416
It's guaranteed.

733
00:51:02.041 --> 00:51:04.416
Look. I'm going to give you a cell phone.

734
00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:07.083
if you're interested in this line of work.

735
00:51:09.041 --> 00:51:12.291
Again. a very generous offer.

736
00:51:12.791 --> 00:51:15.875
but you got the wrong guy.

737
00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:26.166
Well. you know something?
I have huge respect

738
00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:30.291
for men with real courage.

739
00:51:30.750 --> 00:51:32.541
unlike those other wimps.

740
00:51:33.625 --> 00:51:35.541
I like people with zero bullshit.

741
00:51:35.791 --> 00:51:37.833
Javier. are you coming for the pictures?

742
00:51:37.916 --> 00:51:43.208
Yes. my love. whatever you say. come here.

743
00:51:44.166 --> 00:51:46.208
Hug me. Like that.

744
00:51:46.291 --> 00:51:47.458
See you. mustache.

745
00:51:49.791 --> 00:51:52.166
One moment. please.
may I have your attention?

746
00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:53.500
I'd like to say a few words.

747
00:51:53.583 --> 00:51:56.000
I want to make a toast.
I see so much love here.

748
00:51:56.083 --> 00:51:57.500
so much love in everyone's faces!

749
00:51:57.666 --> 00:51:59.666
So. let's raise our glasses.

750
00:51:59.750 --> 00:52:02.041
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

751
00:52:02.333 --> 00:52:04.583
Music. please! Come on. guys!

752
00:52:04.666 --> 00:52:07.000
Our cover is blown. let's get out of here.

753
00:52:13.208 --> 00:52:14.666
At that moment. we had no chance

754
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:16.416
but to abort the mission and leave.

755
00:52:17.291 --> 00:52:19.958
Well. at least
we have them all identified.

756
00:52:20.083 --> 00:52:21.375
which will be useful somehow.

757
00:52:21.958 --> 00:52:22.958
It'll be of so much use.

758
00:52:23.916 --> 00:52:26.291
Salcedo's move blew his own cover.

759
00:52:27.333 --> 00:52:30.833
I didn't know we needed
their faces to match their voices.

760
00:52:33.291 --> 00:52:35.625
One of them is Santana.

761
00:52:35.708 --> 00:52:38.500
our informant. Minister.
but he can't be trusted.

762
00:52:39.958 --> 00:52:41.583
Like Gorostiaga says.

763
00:52:42.291 --> 00:52:45.041
they don't even care about
what we may or may not know.

764
00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:46.750
You know why that is?

765
00:52:47.291 --> 00:52:48.958
Because we never truly messed them up.

766
00:52:49.708 --> 00:52:51.375
This time. we're going to destroy them.

767
00:52:52.458 --> 00:52:54.291
Now that we know all their faces.

768
00:52:55.291 --> 00:52:57.208
our brave Agent Betty will interpret

769
00:52:57.291 --> 00:52:59.208
the remaining recordings.

770
00:52:59.833 --> 00:53:01.833
and once we have
all the necessary information.

771
00:53:02.666 --> 00:53:05.833
we're going to kick
Javier Salcedo's ass so hard.

772
00:53:05.916 --> 00:53:09.291
even his grandchildren
won't be able to sit properly.

773
00:53:15.916 --> 00:53:17.666
-<i>Operation is a go.</i>
-Roger that.

774
00:53:20.875 --> 00:53:21.708
ARMY

775
00:53:38.333 --> 00:53:39.833
AIR FORCE

776
00:53:49.833 --> 00:53:50.916
Truck incoming.

777
00:53:55.875 --> 00:53:56.750
Green light.

778
00:54:05.333 --> 00:54:09.458
-To the floor! Hands over your head!
-Hands over your head! To the floor!

779
00:54:14.375 --> 00:54:15.416
Boss. is everything okay?

780
00:54:16.125 --> 00:54:17.750
Can I help you with something. boss?

781
00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:24.958
You can help me
in 141 million different ways.

782
00:54:27.041 --> 00:54:30.666
What's wrong?
Why are you doing this to me. boss?

783
00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:33.375
What's wrong? I don't understand.

784
00:54:33.583 --> 00:54:36.666
Sit down. shut up and listen.

785
00:54:38.416 --> 00:54:40.500
I want to know something important.

786
00:54:40.958 --> 00:54:43.625
which ones are the bugged phones?

787
00:54:43.958 --> 00:54:46.416
I also want to know if they already

788
00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:48.208
cracked the codes or not.

789
00:54:49.083 --> 00:54:50.791
I don't know
what you're talking about. boss.

790
00:54:50.916 --> 00:54:52.875
I swear I don't know.

791
00:54:52.958 --> 00:54:56.583
Come on. you want me to get mad at you?

792
00:54:56.791 --> 00:54:58.375
-No. boss.
-You want me pissed.

793
00:54:58.458 --> 00:54:59.708
No. boss.

794
00:54:59.791 --> 00:55:01.125
I already know you're a rat.

795
00:55:01.208 --> 00:55:02.958
and you work for SENAD.

796
00:55:05.125 --> 00:55:09.166
In fact. I've known for quite some time

797
00:55:09.250 --> 00:55:10.250
that you work for SENAD.

798
00:55:10.333 --> 00:55:12.458
I just wanted to see
how far you would take it.

799
00:55:16.583 --> 00:55:18.875
Look. this is simple.

800
00:55:20.125 --> 00:55:22.125
There's something
I still don't understand.

801
00:55:23.458 --> 00:55:26.000
If you didn't know about the shipments.

802
00:55:26.125 --> 00:55:29.000
how come the SENAD learned about them?

803
00:55:29.083 --> 00:55:29.916
Answer me.

804
00:55:30.916 --> 00:55:32.125
-Come on.
-I don't know. boss.

805
00:55:34.166 --> 00:55:35.625
I don't know much. boss.

806
00:55:37.791 --> 00:55:39.125
I swear I don't.

807
00:55:41.291 --> 00:55:43.833
I work for them as an insider.
an informant.

808
00:55:45.458 --> 00:55:47.958
But it's been a long time
since I've made contact with them.

809
00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:49.750
Dante. please.

810
00:55:50.458 --> 00:55:52.250
I swear I've got nothing to do with it.

811
00:55:52.708 --> 00:55:54.291
I'm family...

812
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:59.041
-I'm your family!
-Shut the fuck up!

813
00:56:02.625 --> 00:56:04.083
It breaks my heart. you know.

814
00:56:05.791 --> 00:56:08.666
because I really liked you.

815
00:56:09.625 --> 00:56:11.083
Relax.

816
00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:16.333
Your life has little value to me.

817
00:56:16.583 --> 00:56:17.750
Please.

818
00:56:20.333 --> 00:56:23.125
You're like a lamb.

819
00:56:25.375 --> 00:56:29.666
Ten thousand will fall to my left
and a thousand more to my right...

820
00:56:34.416 --> 00:56:36.041
In the name of Christ...

821
00:56:41.125 --> 00:56:42.541
Good morning. Mom.

822
00:56:43.541 --> 00:56:45.750
How are you? Got some coffee?

823
00:56:56.250 --> 00:56:57.083
Milk?

824
00:57:00.166 --> 00:57:01.625
I didn't know you were home.

825
00:57:01.958 --> 00:57:02.958
I didn't hear you come.

826
00:57:06.166 --> 00:57:07.125
I came in late.

827
00:57:09.375 --> 00:57:13.458
Is there something wrong?

828
00:57:15.125 --> 00:57:17.166
Can't a man spend the night

829
00:57:17.458 --> 00:57:21.083
with his wife in his own house?

830
00:57:37.125 --> 00:57:38.833
Holy shit!

831
00:57:40.166 --> 00:57:41.666
Shit. fuck!

832
00:57:43.916 --> 00:57:44.916
Hi. beautiful.

833
00:57:47.958 --> 00:57:48.875
This is unbelievable!

834
00:57:51.375 --> 00:57:52.750
Are you coming home for dinner?

835
00:57:55.375 --> 00:57:56.541
Don't worry.

836
00:57:57.166 --> 00:57:58.541
I'm going to be out for a few days.

837
00:57:58.750 --> 00:58:00.166
there's a shipment coming.

838
00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:02.583
by air. you know?

839
00:58:09.791 --> 00:58:11.083
They're all a bunch of idiots.

840
00:58:11.166 --> 00:58:12.416
motherfuckers.

841
00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:14.958
I'm going to fire their asses.
those motherfuckers.

842
00:58:16.375 --> 00:58:17.666
Holy fucking shit! What?

843
00:58:18.166 --> 00:58:21.916
Oh. excuse me. I didn't know it was you.

844
00:58:49.708 --> 00:58:51.583
Freeze! Drop the gun!

845
00:58:51.666 --> 00:58:52.791
-Hands up!
-Drop the gun!

846
00:58:52.875 --> 00:58:55.375
-Hands where I can see them. damn it!
-Hands up!

847
00:58:56.041 --> 00:58:58.041
-Drop the gun!
-Drop the gun!

848
00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:01.750
Freeze! To the floor!

849
00:59:05.291 --> 00:59:10.416
-Hands where I can see them!
-Freeze. motherfucker!

850
00:59:33.041 --> 00:59:35.208
-Be careful.
-Sorry.

851
00:59:35.458 --> 00:59:37.708
Glue is still wet. Gorostiaga.

852
00:59:38.291 --> 00:59:40.250
Cool. is it yours?

853
00:59:41.291 --> 00:59:44.375
The Minister made so many.
he doesn't know where to store them.

854
00:59:44.916 --> 00:59:46.083
I don't think that's why.

855
00:59:46.416 --> 00:59:48.416
I think he's so grateful
with what you've been doing.

856
00:59:48.541 --> 00:59:50.958
that this is his way of thanking you.

857
00:59:52.208 --> 00:59:53.416
-You think so?
-Yes.

858
00:59:54.583 --> 00:59:56.250
I think you are the ones
doing all the work.

859
00:59:58.958 --> 01:00:01.333
We're just out there fighting.

860
01:00:01.416 --> 01:00:03.708
that's the only thing we know how to do.

861
01:00:05.125 --> 01:00:08.125
What you do here. the intel you give us.

862
01:00:08.458 --> 01:00:09.916
without that. we're completely blind.

863
01:00:11.375 --> 01:00:12.958
Thank you. Gorostiaga.

864
01:00:14.916 --> 01:00:19.666
Still. I think I don't do enough.

865
01:00:21.416 --> 01:00:23.208
Well. I suppose
that's what we all feel. right?

866
01:00:25.833 --> 01:00:27.041
Thanks. anyway.

867
01:00:30.708 --> 01:00:31.666
Are you almost done?

868
01:00:34.166 --> 01:00:35.333
What? Why?

869
01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.041
I don't know. if you're about to leave

870
01:00:38.125 --> 01:00:39.125
and I'm also leaving.

871
01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:41.083
I can walk you home. It's pretty late.

872
01:00:41.791 --> 01:00:44.541
Don't worry. I always walk home alone...

873
01:00:44.666 --> 01:00:45.625
It doesn't matter.

874
01:00:46.208 --> 01:00:47.708
Yes. I realized that.

875
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.041
You always walk alone
and I want to go with you.

876
01:00:52.666 --> 01:00:53.583
Is that okay with you?

877
01:00:57.291 --> 01:00:59.083
Well. yes.

878
01:01:01.166 --> 01:01:02.250
Okay.

879
01:01:02.666 --> 01:01:05.125
-I'm going to go get my jacket...
-Okay.

880
01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:10.875
What's up. Ibañez?

881
01:01:14.375 --> 01:01:15.208
Now?

882
01:01:15.916 --> 01:01:18.583
Ibañez. can't it wait until tomorrow?
First thing in the morning?

883
01:01:20.791 --> 01:01:21.875
Well. okay. it's okay.

884
01:01:21.958 --> 01:01:25.708
I'll be there in 15 minutes. Ibañez.

885
01:01:31.625 --> 01:01:32.458
Betty...

886
01:01:32.625 --> 01:01:34.708
Go ahead. don't worry about me.

887
01:01:34.791 --> 01:01:35.958
I still have to wait here.

888
01:01:36.041 --> 01:01:38.125
Until the glue of the model plane dries.

889
01:01:38.208 --> 01:01:39.291
Just go. don't worry.

890
01:01:41.625 --> 01:01:42.458
Bye.

891
01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:08.375
That thing you said. that sometimes
you don't feel like doing

892
01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:10.833
-enough here.
-Yes?

893
01:02:12.291 --> 01:02:16.958
I don't know. it reminded me
of something my grandpa used to say.

894
01:02:19.333 --> 01:02:22.666
He wasn't a religious man.

895
01:02:23.541 --> 01:02:26.541
and this is the closest to a prayer

896
01:02:26.625 --> 01:02:30.541
I've heard him say once. he repeated it
and it stuck with me ever since.

897
01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:33.750
He used to say...

898
01:02:38.583 --> 01:02:40.666
"I am a little part of the universe.

899
01:02:43.166 --> 01:02:45.125
but the universe
is incomplete without me."

900
01:02:51.833 --> 01:02:52.833
Good night. Betty.

901
01:03:33.041 --> 01:03:35.458
What's wrong with you. sweetheart?

902
01:03:35.541 --> 01:03:36.458
Are you okay?

903
01:03:36.541 --> 01:03:37.916
Yes. Grandpa. you just startled me.

904
01:03:38.041 --> 01:03:41.375
What is that plane. darling?

905
01:03:41.458 --> 01:03:43.625
It's just something from work.
Grandpa. it's nothing.

906
01:03:43.708 --> 01:03:44.666
Yes. but...

907
01:03:52.041 --> 01:03:54.291
Proud Argentinian! What's up. player?

908
01:03:54.375 --> 01:03:55.958
-Nice hair.
-Leave it.

909
01:03:56.041 --> 01:03:57.750
Stop it. I'm not in the mood for jokes.

910
01:03:58.208 --> 01:03:59.083
Well. what's going on?

911
01:03:59.416 --> 01:04:00.750
I called you here because there's

912
01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:03.041
someone who wants to talk to you.

913
01:04:03.125 --> 01:04:03.958
Who is it?

914
01:04:07.333 --> 01:04:09.208
I don't like it. Ibañez.
I don't like it at all.

915
01:04:09.291 --> 01:04:11.500
Stop it. keep that. chump.

916
01:04:11.583 --> 01:04:13.458
hide it!

917
01:04:13.708 --> 01:04:15.750
You think I'd call you here
to get you killed?

918
01:04:15.833 --> 01:04:17.291
You're out of your mind. I work here.

919
01:04:17.375 --> 01:04:19.083
We can expect anything
from someone like you.

920
01:04:19.166 --> 01:04:21.250
-Well. not here. Stop.
-Okay. let's go.

921
01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.208
They want to talk to him alone.

922
01:04:31.041 --> 01:04:32.500
If anything happens to my partner.

923
01:04:32.583 --> 01:04:33.875
it's on you.

924
01:04:53.958 --> 01:04:56.583
You know why my husband and son are dead?

925
01:04:57.083 --> 01:04:58.708
Mrs. Assad. what are you doing here?

926
01:04:58.791 --> 01:05:00.708
My husband and son are dead

927
01:05:00.791 --> 01:05:03.541
because they messed
with those motherfuckers.

928
01:05:04.166 --> 01:05:05.833
So. why did you call us?

929
01:05:06.916 --> 01:05:08.708
My husband believed those people

930
01:05:08.791 --> 01:05:12.333
were capable of anything
as long as they used our airstrips.

931
01:05:12.583 --> 01:05:16.041
and you know what? He was wrong.

932
01:05:16.791 --> 01:05:18.458
Now my son is dead.

933
01:05:19.708 --> 01:05:22.541
Look. ma'am.
I'm really sorry for your loss.

934
01:05:24.125 --> 01:05:25.666
There's a shipment coming.

935
01:05:27.375 --> 01:05:29.125
a very important shipment.

936
01:05:31.125 --> 01:05:33.125
and they're going to land it
on one of my airstrips.

937
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:36.125
Am I supposed to believe you?

938
01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:40.291
Dante is your son-in-law.

939
01:05:41.291 --> 01:05:43.583
-What a relative. right?
-Yes. right.

940
01:05:44.625 --> 01:05:48.291
It's okay. don't believe me.
go do your job. okay?

941
01:05:48.958 --> 01:05:51.500
Of course. leave that to me.

942
01:06:03.583 --> 01:06:06.166
A toast. gentlemen. for the new SENAD.

943
01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:07.416
-For the new SENAD.
-New SENAD.

944
01:06:09.041 --> 01:06:10.166
Fariña. how many were they?

945
01:06:10.541 --> 01:06:12.500
At the warehouse.
there were roughly eight of them.

946
01:06:13.083 --> 01:06:15.166
-How many were you?
-Five.

947
01:06:16.166 --> 01:06:19.166
Let me explain something to you.
when you catch a narc red-handed.

948
01:06:19.416 --> 01:06:23.208
they shit their pants.
Nobody wants to die. not even us.

949
01:06:23.833 --> 01:06:24.833
I'm not making this up.

950
01:06:25.708 --> 01:06:27.333
What do you say. Betty?

951
01:06:28.375 --> 01:06:31.000
I don't know. Gorostiaga. I believe

952
01:06:31.083 --> 01:06:34.958
that death smiles upon us every day.
and the least we can do

953
01:06:35.041 --> 01:06:36.666
is smile back.

954
01:06:38.916 --> 01:06:40.000
What are you talking about?

955
01:06:40.208 --> 01:06:43.291
You tell me. It was written
on your Facebook timeline.

956
01:06:43.458 --> 01:06:46.541
Your thoughts run deep. Gorostiaga.

957
01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:48.541
-Hello.
-Hello.

958
01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:50.833
A toast. to Minister Fernandez.

959
01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:52.875
Fariña. what does this mean?

960
01:06:52.958 --> 01:06:55.000
Drinking at work?

961
01:06:55.916 --> 01:06:56.916
Don't do that. my friend.

962
01:06:58.083 --> 01:07:00.416
I've known the Minister for 20 years.

963
01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:01.666
he's a party pooper.

964
01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:04.125
I don't like celebrating prematurely.

965
01:07:05.125 --> 01:07:06.333
There's still a long way to go.

966
01:07:06.791 --> 01:07:07.958
there's no time for parties.

967
01:07:08.625 --> 01:07:09.458
Sit down.

968
01:07:12.166 --> 01:07:16.833
Minister. Gorostiaga and I got intel
about an important shipment

969
01:07:17.083 --> 01:07:18.833
which would be arriving by air

970
01:07:18.916 --> 01:07:20.750
between tomorrow and October 24th.

971
01:07:20.833 --> 01:07:21.916
Do we know where it'll land?

972
01:07:22.541 --> 01:07:25.041
According to our informant.
it'll be on one of Assad's airstrips.

973
01:07:26.458 --> 01:07:28.041
We know there are ten of them.

974
01:07:28.833 --> 01:07:30.000
they all belong to Assad.

975
01:07:30.083 --> 01:07:32.041
well. to the widow now.

976
01:07:33.833 --> 01:07:38.791
These three are flooded.
so they're ruled out.

977
01:07:39.083 --> 01:07:42.000
so. only these are left.
Vakareta. Laguna Tuerta.

978
01:07:42.083 --> 01:07:46.666
Old John. Villa Emilia. Toro Rey.
Kuarahy and Poncho Azul.

979
01:07:47.375 --> 01:07:50.958
The thing is. the airstrips are
several kilometers away from each other.

980
01:07:51.791 --> 01:07:54.583
The only way to get to them and really

981
01:07:54.875 --> 01:07:57.541
keep an eye on them is going deep
into the woods. right here.

982
01:07:58.250 --> 01:08:01.541
Besides. we have to consider
that pilots. when they land.

983
01:08:01.625 --> 01:08:03.666
they keep the engine running.

984
01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:06.458
Sometimes they turn them off. but anyway.

985
01:08:06.541 --> 01:08:08.250
they load and unload
in a matter of minutes.

986
01:08:08.916 --> 01:08:13.166
If we don't know their landing time
and place exactly.

987
01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:14.833
it'll be impossible for us to catch them.

988
01:08:15.083 --> 01:08:17.458
Unless those codes are cracked.

989
01:08:18.375 --> 01:08:19.916
We're still on it.

990
01:08:20.208 --> 01:08:22.000
they've changed their phones. Gorostiaga.

991
01:08:22.083 --> 01:08:23.833
but we're working day and night on it.

992
01:08:24.541 --> 01:08:27.541
Betty and the guys are going
to tap all of their phones.

993
01:08:27.666 --> 01:08:30.083
Yes. sir. it's just a matter of time.

994
01:08:30.750 --> 01:08:33.666
I hope so. because we're blind right now.

995
01:08:33.750 --> 01:08:36.333
and whatever is happening.
it's happening right now.

996
01:08:37.208 --> 01:08:38.291
Look. Gorostiaga. what I do

997
01:08:38.375 --> 01:08:41.291
is not as simple and basic
as picking up a gun.

998
01:08:41.375 --> 01:08:42.833
aim and fire.

999
01:08:44.166 --> 01:08:46.458
Not even the pilot knows
where he's going to land.

1000
01:08:46.541 --> 01:08:48.541
he gets a message.
only a few minutes in advance.

1001
01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:51.250
and it's always encrypted.
Here. we cross-reference all the messages.

1002
01:08:51.333 --> 01:08:54.041
the key is always changing.
they never say the same things twice.

1003
01:08:54.125 --> 01:08:54.958
Meaning?

1004
01:08:55.166 --> 01:08:58.166
We won't be able to intercept
that shipment on time.

1005
01:09:02.333 --> 01:09:06.333
There are seven airstrips. why don't
we try to eliminate as many as we can?

1006
01:09:06.666 --> 01:09:07.791
How's that possible?

1007
01:09:08.916 --> 01:09:11.625
These here are
in the middle of plantations.

1008
01:09:11.708 --> 01:09:14.416
That's true. there are at least 400 acres

1009
01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:16.500
of marijuana plantations there. Minister.

1010
01:09:16.583 --> 01:09:19.916
Exactly. what if we go there
and set them on fire?

1011
01:09:20.875 --> 01:09:23.166
Between the smoke
and our presence in the area.

1012
01:09:23.250 --> 01:09:25.041
those three airstrips will be disabled.

1013
01:09:26.375 --> 01:09:27.875
So we have only Vakareta.

1014
01:09:27.958 --> 01:09:29.916
Laguna Tuerta. Poncho Azul
and Old John left.

1015
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.166
They're reduced to four.
this is deep into the woods.

1016
01:09:32.250 --> 01:09:33.958
I can go here with my unit.

1017
01:09:34.916 --> 01:09:35.958
and wait for instructions.

1018
01:09:36.041 --> 01:09:38.125
Betty is going to crack those codes.

1019
01:09:38.208 --> 01:09:41.041
and you'll get your instructions then.
Gorostiaga.

1020
01:09:42.333 --> 01:09:43.291
Is that so. Betty?

1021
01:09:43.375 --> 01:09:44.500
Of course. Minister.

1022
01:09:44.958 --> 01:09:45.958
What's wrong. Espínola?

1023
01:09:46.916 --> 01:09:48.416
-Come on in.
-Espínola. what's going on?

1024
01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.083
- They sent you this. Minister.
- What is that?

1025
01:09:52.833 --> 01:09:56.083
-Son of a bitch!
-Holy shit!

1026
01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:01.875
Fariña. light up those fields immediately!

1027
01:10:02.208 --> 01:10:05.083
Gorostiaga.
get ready to mobilize your troops.

1028
01:10:05.166 --> 01:10:06.041
Yes. sir.

1029
01:10:06.125 --> 01:10:08.083
And you. Ibañez.
get me that airstrip's name.

1030
01:10:08.416 --> 01:10:09.250
Yes. sir.

1031
01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:15.875
TRANSFERRED
RED ZONE

1032
01:10:51.541 --> 01:10:54.250
It's hot as hell here at night!

1033
01:10:55.625 --> 01:10:57.625
It seems like the first night
is always the toughest.

1034
01:10:57.750 --> 01:10:59.916
No. Shakes. all nights are the same here.

1035
01:11:02.458 --> 01:11:05.083
-Shit. Russian. buddy!
-Russian.

1036
01:11:05.958 --> 01:11:08.291
-What's up?
-I'm hungry.

1037
01:11:14.375 --> 01:11:18.166
Russian. you're lucky I brought this.

1038
01:11:19.375 --> 01:11:22.125
to give some taste
to what you're cooking there.

1039
01:11:24.875 --> 01:11:25.708
Here. Russian.

1040
01:11:27.875 --> 01:11:29.333
Not like that. you idiot.

1041
01:11:30.375 --> 01:11:31.500
You have to put it there.

1042
01:11:34.375 --> 01:11:35.291
Do you smell that?

1043
01:11:36.791 --> 01:11:37.875
It's like a public restroom.

1044
01:11:37.958 --> 01:11:41.791
-Holy shit. Chamorro!
-You smell bad. damn it!

1045
01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:45.333
What's going on in Vakareta. Chamorro?

1046
01:11:45.791 --> 01:11:47.750
Only golden rain. Captain.

1047
01:11:49.041 --> 01:11:51.208
What are you smelling?

1048
01:11:55.166 --> 01:11:56.000
Damn it!

1049
01:12:11.916 --> 01:12:15.791
-Russian. do the Little Feet.
-What?

1050
01:12:17.291 --> 01:12:18.125
Little Feet.

1051
01:12:20.291 --> 01:12:21.666
Don't you know what Little Feet is?

1052
01:12:24.875 --> 01:12:25.875
Come on. I'll show you.

1053
01:12:30.666 --> 01:12:31.500
Watch.

1054
01:12:32.708 --> 01:12:34.083
Russian. look at me.

1055
01:12:35.625 --> 01:12:38.666
Put your hands like this.
I put my foot there.

1056
01:12:39.666 --> 01:12:43.291
you lift me. I go up here.

1057
01:12:44.666 --> 01:12:45.500
Little Feet.

1058
01:12:46.208 --> 01:12:47.666
Isn't it more like "lifts"?

1059
01:12:49.125 --> 01:12:50.250
Come on.

1060
01:13:07.583 --> 01:13:08.833
Holy shit. Russian!

1061
01:13:08.916 --> 01:13:10.791
What the fuck did you do?
You got me backwards?

1062
01:13:14.166 --> 01:13:17.416
You're doing it wrong. my friend.

1063
01:13:18.708 --> 01:13:21.375
-Russian.
-To hell with you. I'm leaving!

1064
01:13:33.625 --> 01:13:36.083
Command. base here. Do you copy?

1065
01:13:38.041 --> 01:13:40.333
<i>Base. command here. Roger.</i>

1066
01:13:40.625 --> 01:13:42.000
Everything's quiet here.

1067
01:13:42.958 --> 01:13:45.666
standing by for intel.

1068
01:13:47.125 --> 01:13:51.541
And very grateful for all the work

1069
01:13:52.458 --> 01:13:54.958
<i>you're doing out there. Over.</i>

1070
01:13:55.041 --> 01:13:58.583
Roger. No news around here.

1071
01:13:59.250 --> 01:14:01.125
but very grateful for your work
as well. soldier.

1072
01:14:01.833 --> 01:14:02.750
Over and out.

1073
01:14:04.541 --> 01:14:05.625
It is them. right?

1074
01:14:06.041 --> 01:14:06.958
Are they all right?

1075
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.791
They're fine. go home.
we'll finish this tomorrow. okay?

1076
01:14:13.458 --> 01:14:16.791
They're over there. the least
we can do is be here for them.

1077
01:14:19.208 --> 01:14:22.708
Holy shit. Gorostiaga. my friend!

1078
01:14:23.625 --> 01:14:25.250
They say ugly men are the luckiest.

1079
01:14:25.708 --> 01:14:28.375
Chamorro. where are you from?

1080
01:14:28.875 --> 01:14:30.791
- I'm from Pilar. Captain.
- Really?

1081
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.041
Where the most beautiful
Paraguayans are born.

1082
01:14:36.875 --> 01:14:39.333
You were born
in the wrong town then. Chamorro.

1083
01:14:40.458 --> 01:14:42.208
Yes. sure. handsome.

1084
01:14:45.458 --> 01:14:46.791
Don't pay any attention to him.

1085
01:14:47.166 --> 01:14:50.416
Tell me. You learned
to hide there? In Pilar?

1086
01:14:51.041 --> 01:14:52.541
I'm just going to tell you. Captain.

1087
01:14:52.625 --> 01:14:55.833
let's pretend the coast is clear.

1088
01:14:56.666 --> 01:15:00.708
My grandpa once told me the story

1089
01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.333
of the Chaco War. he was head

1090
01:15:04.416 --> 01:15:07.708
of a scouting patrol on the front.
he was a wise man.

1091
01:15:08.250 --> 01:15:09.500
He knows how to hide.

1092
01:15:10.291 --> 01:15:16.541
He killed tigers. wild boars.
he was good at tracking scents.

1093
01:15:17.875 --> 01:15:21.708
So. that's how he taught me
how to hunt a tiger.

1094
01:15:22.625 --> 01:15:24.000
How to hunt a tiger?

1095
01:15:24.916 --> 01:15:26.000
Yes. Captain.

1096
01:15:27.791 --> 01:15:31.083
He would drench his clothes in cow's piss.

1097
01:15:31.458 --> 01:15:36.916
because a tiger just wants
to eat whatever meat they can find.

1098
01:15:37.666 --> 01:15:41.125
"Tigers are cunning. son."
he used to tell me.

1099
01:15:42.208 --> 01:15:45.250
because they can smell anything
from far. far away

1100
01:15:48.708 --> 01:15:51.458
and with that scent
they know what's on their way.

1101
01:15:53.291 --> 01:15:57.750
Tigers can tell if it's a person
or a cockroach.

1102
01:15:59.666 --> 01:16:04.875
To kill it.
you have to climb up a tall tree.

1103
01:16:05.958 --> 01:16:09.875
and you wait for it. watch its movements.

1104
01:16:11.166 --> 01:16:17.250
And when it gets closer.
and closer still...

1105
01:16:19.666 --> 01:16:22.375
that's when you put a bullet

1106
01:16:22.875 --> 01:16:27.000
between its eyes.

1107
01:16:29.416 --> 01:16:30.291
Bye. tiger.

1108
01:16:32.625 --> 01:16:36.375
That's why nobody is able
to track me easily. Captain.

1109
01:16:37.458 --> 01:16:40.791
So. you're hunter and prey
at the same time.

1110
01:16:41.458 --> 01:16:42.625
That's right. Captain.

1111
01:16:43.708 --> 01:16:45.541
Golden rain runs in the family. then.

1112
01:16:46.166 --> 01:16:47.416
Son of a bitch. Shakes.

1113
01:16:50.291 --> 01:16:52.708
-Captain...
-Ration that.

1114
01:16:54.166 --> 01:16:55.458
When is the wedding?

1115
01:16:55.583 --> 01:16:56.833
What wedding? Whose?

1116
01:16:59.833 --> 01:17:00.666
Mine?

1117
01:17:01.458 --> 01:17:04.833
No. soldier. that's not my thing.

1118
01:17:05.416 --> 01:17:07.958
Not even with the brave one. Captain?

1119
01:17:08.458 --> 01:17:11.625
The one that likes to solve puzzles?

1120
01:17:12.875 --> 01:17:16.458
I don't know what you're talking about.
You might as well be speaking in Japanese.

1121
01:17:16.541 --> 01:17:17.916
It's obvious that she likes you.

1122
01:17:18.125 --> 01:17:19.166
It's too obvious.

1123
01:17:19.666 --> 01:17:22.708
You know what. Captain?

1124
01:17:23.250 --> 01:17:27.958
Her eyes are all heart-shaped.
like the WhatsApp emoji.

1125
01:17:30.125 --> 01:17:30.958
Really?

1126
01:17:33.666 --> 01:17:35.958
-Told you. you owe me 100 bucks.
-No. you idiot.

1127
01:17:36.125 --> 01:17:37.125
Sons of bitches. you two!

1128
01:17:37.916 --> 01:17:39.875
What about you. Russian?
Do you have a girlfriend?

1129
01:17:40.208 --> 01:17:41.041
No. Captain.

1130
01:17:42.125 --> 01:17:43.708
No? Do you live with your family?

1131
01:17:44.291 --> 01:17:45.208
I live alone.

1132
01:17:46.125 --> 01:17:47.083
What about your parents?

1133
01:17:50.208 --> 01:17:51.958
They died when I was a kid.

1134
01:17:52.291 --> 01:17:53.625
Mine too. Private.

1135
01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.000
How did you end up in Special Ops?

1136
01:18:02.583 --> 01:18:04.250
Thanks to Sergeant Major Fariña.

1137
01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:06.791
He was my mom's best friend.

1138
01:18:07.541 --> 01:18:09.625
he adopted me after the accident.

1139
01:18:10.250 --> 01:18:11.500
that's how I got here.

1140
01:18:12.125 --> 01:18:13.416
Fariña is a great man.

1141
01:18:17.625 --> 01:18:18.458
Captain.

1142
01:18:20.666 --> 01:18:21.708
seriously.

1143
01:18:22.583 --> 01:18:26.000
I think Betty likes your skin.

1144
01:18:28.583 --> 01:18:30.208
You're a bunch of idiots!

1145
01:18:30.291 --> 01:18:33.000
Well. I'll take first guard.

1146
01:18:34.416 --> 01:18:36.416
Get some rest.
Tomorrow's going to be a long day.

1147
01:18:36.541 --> 01:18:38.416
-Good night.
-Good night.

1148
01:18:48.625 --> 01:18:50.500
Russian!

1149
01:18:51.666 --> 01:18:55.916
Cow piss to hunt a tiger.

1150
01:18:56.666 --> 01:19:00.708
and human piss to hunt other things.

1151
01:19:41.833 --> 01:19:44.666
Base. Gorostiaga. testing comms.

1152
01:19:46.541 --> 01:19:47.375
Roger.

1153
01:20:28.375 --> 01:20:29.458
Good night. guys.

1154
01:20:43.791 --> 01:20:47.083
Dude. spare some change?

1155
01:21:10.166 --> 01:21:11.000
Jackass.

1156
01:21:40.708 --> 01:21:42.166
What's wrong. buddy?

1157
01:21:42.250 --> 01:21:44.625
Are those birds distracting you?

1158
01:21:45.166 --> 01:21:46.750
Stop joking. dude.

1159
01:21:47.333 --> 01:21:49.000
You know how it is out here.

1160
01:21:49.583 --> 01:21:52.291
The quieter the woods seems.
the more dangerous it can become.

1161
01:21:53.458 --> 01:21:56.958
Easy. buddy.
we're going to take care of this.

1162
01:22:16.250 --> 01:22:20.625
Leave everything. Go to your homes.

1163
01:22:23.041 --> 01:22:24.375
Go to your families.

1164
01:22:28.250 --> 01:22:31.583
Rest assured you have
my support and consideration.

1165
01:22:34.208 --> 01:22:35.333
I'll be here...

1166
01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:39.875
to carry on with the operation.

1167
01:22:54.750 --> 01:22:57.208
You're not guilty of his murder.

1168
01:23:00.291 --> 01:23:01.791
If I'm not guilty.

1169
01:23:03.625 --> 01:23:04.458
then who is?

1170
01:23:05.708 --> 01:23:09.125
He was at the academy
and I went searching for him.

1171
01:23:10.916 --> 01:23:14.541
He had fulfilled his duty.
he was already resting.

1172
01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:17.666
I went there.

1173
01:23:19.208 --> 01:23:21.416
You gave Ricardo his life back.

1174
01:23:22.083 --> 01:23:25.958
<i>he was a soldier.
he needed to live like a soldier.</i>

1175
01:23:27.166 --> 01:23:29.041
<i>you gave him an opportunity.</i>

1176
01:23:30.375 --> 01:23:32.583
<i>he chose to follow you. my love.</i>

1177
01:23:34.416 --> 01:23:37.500
What's the point? He's dead now.

1178
01:23:40.333 --> 01:23:42.666
He would never hold anything
against you. Ramón.

1179
01:23:45.291 --> 01:23:46.958
Those motherfucking narcs

1180
01:23:48.875 --> 01:23:50.541
are changing all the rules.

1181
01:23:54.375 --> 01:23:55.625
I'm afraid. Elvira.

1182
01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:59.333
if something happens to you. I will die.

1183
01:24:00.958 --> 01:24:03.416
Do you think I would leave your side

1184
01:24:04.333 --> 01:24:06.083
after all these years?

1185
01:24:06.791 --> 01:24:09.833
Never. my love!

1186
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.916
Why don't you go to sleep. sweetheart?

1187
01:24:23.916 --> 01:24:25.875
I can't. Grandpa. I have to work.

1188
01:24:26.583 --> 01:24:28.208
There's a lot of people depending on this.

1189
01:24:28.666 --> 01:24:32.250
Are you assembling
a Brazilian soccer team. honey?

1190
01:24:32.416 --> 01:24:33.875
What are you talking about. Grandpa?

1191
01:24:34.125 --> 01:24:36.833
I can tell from the list you're making.

1192
01:24:38.958 --> 01:24:40.166
I'm talking about this.

1193
01:24:40.458 --> 01:24:45.583
Balú. he played right fullback
for Cruzeiro for a long time.

1194
01:24:46.416 --> 01:24:47.416
he was a good player.

1195
01:24:47.625 --> 01:24:51.416
Then Adilio. Adilio was a great player

1196
01:24:51.791 --> 01:24:55.750
he was skilled. but nobody knows him.

1197
01:24:55.833 --> 01:24:58.416
because he was shadowed by Zico.

1198
01:24:58.958 --> 01:25:02.291
Tostao. he was center forward.

1199
01:25:02.458 --> 01:25:05.208
These two are goalkeepers.
Zeti and Gilmar.

1200
01:25:05.291 --> 01:25:09.583
These are midfielders. these three.

1201
01:25:10.708 --> 01:25:14.666
Five defenders. these were defenders.

1202
01:25:15.083 --> 01:25:18.000
Cafú was a great right fullback.

1203
01:25:19.791 --> 01:25:24.041
Why didn't you tell me
you were interested in soccer?

1204
01:25:34.875 --> 01:25:36.291
Minister. good morning.

1205
01:25:36.375 --> 01:25:37.500
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

1206
01:25:37.583 --> 01:25:39.166
Good morning. Minister.

1207
01:25:39.708 --> 01:25:40.666
We're all here. sir.

1208
01:25:41.166 --> 01:25:42.208
Betty is missing.

1209
01:25:44.083 --> 01:25:45.625
Not just Betty. Minister.

1210
01:25:46.291 --> 01:25:47.833
We've lost contact with the whole squad.

1211
01:25:48.583 --> 01:25:50.625
<i>Gorostiaga made a SATCOM call.</i>

1212
01:25:50.708 --> 01:25:52.250
but it stopped out of nowhere.

1213
01:25:53.583 --> 01:25:54.708
They're off the grid. sir.

1214
01:25:55.625 --> 01:25:58.583
It's done. the names are the key!

1215
01:25:59.333 --> 01:26:00.291
My grandpa helped me.

1216
01:26:01.166 --> 01:26:03.125
The key is soccer.

1217
01:26:03.208 --> 01:26:05.125
they're all Brazilian soccer players.

1218
01:26:05.208 --> 01:26:10.458
Look. Balú. Alemao. Aldair.

1219
01:26:10.708 --> 01:26:14.500
-the key is here.
-Can you repeat those names?

1220
01:26:14.583 --> 01:26:19.541
Yes. Balú. Aldair. Alemao.

1221
01:26:20.041 --> 01:26:21.416
then Mazinho...

1222
01:26:21.708 --> 01:26:23.875
In that case. it has to follow a pattern.

1223
01:26:24.625 --> 01:26:27.833
the order of the airstrips with some
typical soccer formation.

1224
01:26:27.916 --> 01:26:31.416
It can be 4-4-2. this is a typical 4-3-3.

1225
01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:32.375
if you look here.

1226
01:26:33.083 --> 01:26:35.291
This is right fullback.
this is left fullback.

1227
01:26:35.375 --> 01:26:38.000
the defense line. two center-backs here.

1228
01:26:38.083 --> 01:26:41.541
Midfielders. right midfielder.
left midfielder.

1229
01:26:41.625 --> 01:26:43.416
and this is center forward.

1230
01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:46.166
So. what we have to do is pay attention

1231
01:26:46.250 --> 01:26:47.916
to the name of some soccer player

1232
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.500
in any of these positions.

1233
01:26:49.875 --> 01:26:50.791
That's right.

1234
01:26:51.666 --> 01:26:52.958
Perfect. good job. agents.

1235
01:26:53.916 --> 01:26:57.583
How do we get this info
to Gorostiaga and his squad?

1236
01:26:57.666 --> 01:26:59.500
What? Why? What happened?

1237
01:26:59.583 --> 01:27:02.750
They're isolated in the middle
of nowhere with no comms.

1238
01:27:03.583 --> 01:27:05.250
Someone has to tell them.

1239
01:27:15.958 --> 01:27:18.583
OPERATION PURE SMOKE

1240
01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:28.250
<i>Attention. sniper. Sniper 1. sniper 2.
ready to board.</i>

1241
01:27:29.833 --> 01:27:36.291
<i>Sniper. Attention. sniper 1. sniper 2.
Moving to second position.</i>

1242
01:27:38.583 --> 01:27:42.166
<i>Sniper ready and in position.</i>

1243
01:28:05.166 --> 01:28:06.000
ARMY

1244
01:28:26.166 --> 01:28:28.333
Stay put. let them pass!

1245
01:28:28.625 --> 01:28:30.041
They're just going to their farms.

1246
01:28:31.791 --> 01:28:35.333
Easy. these people help us
at the plantations.

1247
01:29:00.875 --> 01:29:02.666
Stay calm. Shakes. my friend.

1248
01:29:03.250 --> 01:29:04.375
It's me. Ibañez.

1249
01:29:05.708 --> 01:29:06.833
Are you lost?

1250
01:29:07.333 --> 01:29:10.708
Holy shit! Luckily. I found you. damn it.

1251
01:29:14.958 --> 01:29:16.333
Somebody has to tell him.

1252
01:29:17.666 --> 01:29:19.625
I think it's better if we tell him.

1253
01:29:20.708 --> 01:29:22.250
Shakes and I as his partners.

1254
01:29:24.166 --> 01:29:29.583
Fariña was a jaguar.
these motherfuckers made a mistake.

1255
01:29:35.583 --> 01:29:37.750
It means a lot that you came here

1256
01:29:38.833 --> 01:29:42.708
to tell us. Ibañez.
and thanks for the intel too.

1257
01:29:44.416 --> 01:29:48.000
It's my job.
we have to thank Betty for the intel.

1258
01:29:48.208 --> 01:29:50.083
You both did a great job then.

1259
01:29:52.541 --> 01:29:54.666
Is there a confirmation
on Dante being the murderer?

1260
01:29:55.875 --> 01:29:56.916
-Yes.
-Yes.

1261
01:29:59.041 --> 01:30:01.458
Dante is the one
who used to patrol the fields.

1262
01:30:02.125 --> 01:30:03.041
The same one.

1263
01:30:05.083 --> 01:30:06.333
Well. this is the plan then.

1264
01:30:07.958 --> 01:30:11.916
Tomorrow. when we get
the green light on the airstrip.

1265
01:30:13.916 --> 01:30:14.958
we're going to go there.

1266
01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:18.875
I'll place Shakes 200 meters from there.

1267
01:30:21.041 --> 01:30:23.791
and we'll kill all those sons of bitches.

1268
01:30:24.041 --> 01:30:25.250
without leaving a trace.

1269
01:30:26.958 --> 01:30:28.166
Then we'll go home.

1270
01:30:29.625 --> 01:30:30.833
That's the plan. Ibañez.

1271
01:30:36.333 --> 01:30:37.458
If we're going to do that.

1272
01:30:38.458 --> 01:30:40.791
we better get ourselves a good lawyer.

1273
01:30:42.125 --> 01:30:46.083
because we're all going to jail
for homicide.

1274
01:30:58.541 --> 01:31:00.958
FORMATION 4-3-3

1275
01:31:52.458 --> 01:31:53.375
Djalma S.

1276
01:31:53.458 --> 01:31:55.375
Check it. Djalma S.

1277
01:31:55.458 --> 01:31:58.083
Djalma Santos. he played for Palmeiras.

1278
01:31:59.208 --> 01:32:02.708
he was a right fullback.

1279
01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:08.208
but also a center fullback. Shit!

1280
01:32:10.583 --> 01:32:11.791
At that time.

1281
01:32:11.875 --> 01:32:14.125
fullbacks didn't play
as aggressively as they do now.

1282
01:32:16.958 --> 01:32:18.375
If the code is correct.

1283
01:32:18.916 --> 01:32:20.625
it must be right fullback. for sure.

1284
01:32:20.708 --> 01:32:21.541
Vakareta.

1285
01:32:21.958 --> 01:32:24.750
Well. deliver the info safely and quickly.

1286
01:32:24.833 --> 01:32:26.416
come on. there's no time to waste.

1287
01:32:27.166 --> 01:32:28.000
Betty!

1288
01:32:29.125 --> 01:32:32.875
<i>Djalma S.. I repeat. Djalma S.</i>

1289
01:32:46.791 --> 01:32:47.833
Do you copy? Base here.

1290
01:32:51.041 --> 01:32:54.583
Roger that. Vakareta. Over and out.

1291
01:32:57.333 --> 01:33:00.125
Captain! We have a go. It's Vakareta.

1292
01:33:00.250 --> 01:33:01.291
Wake everybody up!

1293
01:33:01.375 --> 01:33:04.166
Ibañez! Everybody up! Now!

1294
01:33:04.250 --> 01:33:05.250
Come on. Ibañez.

1295
01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:16.083
VAKARETA TRACK

1296
01:33:30.833 --> 01:33:33.833
Hello. Mr. Dante.
Are you using the airstrip today?

1297
01:33:34.375 --> 01:33:37.166
That's none of your business.
get back inside your shack.

1298
01:33:37.250 --> 01:33:39.750
-Go away. get out!
-Come on! Get out!

1299
01:33:40.750 --> 01:33:41.916
Fucking peasant.

1300
01:33:57.833 --> 01:34:00.375
Attention. everybody. pay attention.

1301
01:34:01.791 --> 01:34:03.041
Shipment is arriving.

1302
01:34:13.708 --> 01:34:15.083
Three trucks on the field.

1303
01:34:15.541 --> 01:34:16.958
five to six armed men.

1304
01:34:17.458 --> 01:34:18.916
carrying both long and short weapons.

1305
01:34:24.708 --> 01:34:26.875
Shakes. give Ibañez your M4.

1306
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.708
This is the field.

1307
01:34:36.541 --> 01:34:37.625
We're here.

1308
01:34:39.166 --> 01:34:40.833
First truck is here.

1309
01:34:41.583 --> 01:34:45.291
Trucks two and three here.
This is the shack.

1310
01:34:46.916 --> 01:34:47.958
Russian. Chamorro.

1311
01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.916
step in from here
and secure car number one.

1312
01:34:52.208 --> 01:34:54.708
Ibañez. you come with me.
we're going around the shack.

1313
01:34:54.791 --> 01:34:56.083
we secure cars two and three.

1314
01:34:57.166 --> 01:35:00.541
Shakes. you secure
the perimeter from here.

1315
01:35:01.583 --> 01:35:03.666
-Ready?
-Ready.

1316
01:35:03.750 --> 01:35:05.541
-Jaguar?
-Jaguar!

1317
01:35:05.625 --> 01:35:07.583
-The fist. Ibañez.
-Fuck you. Shakes!

1318
01:35:07.875 --> 01:35:09.375
-Jaguar!
-Jaguar!

1319
01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.583
Go! The plane has arrived!

1320
01:35:23.916 --> 01:35:24.750
Front!

1321
01:35:31.708 --> 01:35:33.250
Faster. damn it!

1322
01:35:38.708 --> 01:35:39.583
Faster!

1323
01:35:49.250 --> 01:35:50.500
Come on! Damn it!

1324
01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:54.125
-Are you ready?
-Ready.

1325
01:36:01.458 --> 01:36:05.041
-Freeze. narcotics!
-Freeze!

1326
01:36:05.125 --> 01:36:08.375
-Stay down! Shit!
-Don't move!

1327
01:36:08.541 --> 01:36:11.500
-Stay down. motherfuckers!
-I said. down!

1328
01:36:11.583 --> 01:36:14.416
-Put that down!
-Motherfucker.

1329
01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:18.083
-Drop your weapons!
-Freeze! Don't move!

1330
01:36:18.166 --> 01:36:21.916
-Stay down. motherfuckers!
-Down! Don't move! Drop the weapon.

1331
01:36:23.708 --> 01:36:25.166
Come on. damn it!

1332
01:37:00.958 --> 01:37:03.833
-Stop! Freeze!
-Stay down!

1333
01:37:47.083 --> 01:37:48.750
Look at me!

1334
01:37:49.083 --> 01:37:51.291
Remember me? Do you remember me?

1335
01:37:51.375 --> 01:37:53.500
Son of a bitch. loyal rat.

1336
01:37:53.583 --> 01:37:55.416
The same one.

1337
01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:57.625
The man you killed days ago.

1338
01:37:57.958 --> 01:38:00.291
with two shots in the back.
you remember him. right?

1339
01:38:00.375 --> 01:38:03.958
Fariña. that asshole is already in hell.

1340
01:38:04.541 --> 01:38:05.916
You know who that asshole was?

1341
01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:11.083
He was my friend.
my friend. Sergeant Major Fariña!

1342
01:38:11.958 --> 01:38:13.958
Come on. kill me. damn it!

1343
01:38:14.041 --> 01:38:17.416
You're the same piece of shit as I am.

1344
01:38:17.708 --> 01:38:19.583
Come on! Pull the trigger!

1345
01:38:19.750 --> 01:38:21.333
The same piece of shit!

1346
01:38:21.416 --> 01:38:23.166
Come on! Pull the trigger!

1347
01:38:29.833 --> 01:38:31.541
You have no balls. motherfucker.

1348
01:38:31.833 --> 01:38:33.208
No balls! You're useless!

1349
01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:37.250
You know what? You're right.
I'm a piece of shit.

1350
01:38:37.833 --> 01:38:39.708
-But I've got balls!
-But we're not the same.

1351
01:38:51.708 --> 01:38:53.208
Black with no sugar.

1352
01:39:05.583 --> 01:39:07.833
What does your lap dog want?

1353
01:39:11.333 --> 01:39:13.500
Household things. Javier. don't worry.

1354
01:39:19.958 --> 01:39:20.958
Hello...

1355
01:39:28.583 --> 01:39:29.416
How?

1356
01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:31.916
Where the hell is Dante?

1357
01:39:33.125 --> 01:39:33.958
What?

1358
01:39:36.208 --> 01:39:37.625
No. I'm going there.

1359
01:39:48.833 --> 01:39:49.958
What's wrong?

1360
01:39:54.625 --> 01:39:55.666
What's wrong. Javier?

1361
01:39:58.958 --> 01:40:00.750
Now all the clowns are here.

1362
01:40:01.708 --> 01:40:05.583
Aren't you supposed to be at
Pettirossi Airport sucking a cop's dick?

1363
01:40:12.208 --> 01:40:15.916
Gentlemen. from now on. I'm in charge
of all things related to the airstrips.

1364
01:40:16.291 --> 01:40:17.166
Got it?

1365
01:40:18.791 --> 01:40:20.166
Fine by me. ma'am.

1366
01:40:21.041 --> 01:40:21.916
My respect.

1367
01:40:31.875 --> 01:40:36.541
<i>Attention. Dragon.
We request air security immediately.</i>

<i>Situation in the operations zone.

1369
01:40:42.500 --> 01:40:48.500
<i>I repeat. one injured.
We have one injured.</i>

1370
01:40:50.833 --> 01:40:53.833
<i>I request confirmation of arrival</i>

1371
01:40:53.916 --> 01:40:57.000
<i>one minute before getting to
the operations zone. Over.</i>

1372
01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.250
<i>This is Dragon. Roger. We are on the way.</i>

1373
01:41:00.333 --> 01:41:01.333

DRUG GANG FALLS
SEVERE BLOW TO DRUG TRAFFICKING BY SENAD

1376
01:41:19.875 --> 01:41:21.750
-Congratulations. guys.
-Thank you. Minister.

1377
01:41:21.833 --> 01:41:23.125
I'm so sorry for Russian.

1378
01:41:23.333 --> 01:41:25.375
It's hard to believe Fariña

1379
01:41:25.458 --> 01:41:27.208
is not here with us anymore.

1380
01:41:28.375 --> 01:41:29.333
No. Gorostiaga.

1381
01:41:30.083 --> 01:41:32.666
us crazies and dreamers are always here.

1382
01:41:33.416 --> 01:41:34.958
wherever we are.

1383
01:41:37.875 --> 01:41:40.708
Blondie. my grandpa
runs faster than you. my friend.

1384
01:41:40.791 --> 01:41:43.541
Russian. Little Feet.

1385
01:41:44.625 --> 01:41:46.458
When I get out of here.
I'll give you Fists.

1386
01:41:47.375 --> 01:41:48.291
Gorostiaga...

1387
01:41:57.166 --> 01:41:58.708
Betty. what are you doing here?

1388
01:41:58.791 --> 01:41:59.833
