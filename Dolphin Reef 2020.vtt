3
00:00:28.904 --> 00:00:33.659
Tiny Polynesian islands
in the middle of a vast ocean.

4
00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:38.163
These lonely. remote outcroppings

5
00:00:38.664 --> 00:00:41.333
provide the backdrop for an amazing story.

6
00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:45.546
with characters
as fantastical as any fairy tale.

7
00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:48.549
but as real as you and me.

8
00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:53.262
To find them.

9
00:00:53.637 --> 00:00:56.932
we must leave behind
the world of land and sky.

10
00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:01.353
of sun-drenched beaches
and tropical flora.

11
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:10.279
This world operates
under a different set of rules.

12
00:02:34.805 --> 00:02:37.849
Some dolphins
just aren't that into surfing.

13
00:02:41.812 --> 00:02:43.522
This is Echo.

14
00:02:44.064 --> 00:02:46.441
a three-year-old bottlenose dolphin.

15
00:02:49.236 --> 00:02:51.279
Unlike the other members of his pod.

16
00:02:51.988 --> 00:02:55.075
he tends to shy away
from group activities.

17
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.999
He is very handy with a shell though.

18
00:03:11.758 --> 00:03:14.886
Unfortunately.
these are not the kinds of skills

19
00:03:15.053 --> 00:03:18.098
he's going to need to grow up
and survive on his own.

20
00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:24.604
Until recently. he's relied solely
on his mother. Kumu.

21
00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:26.648
to feed him and protect him...

22
00:03:29.443 --> 00:03:31.820
but now. he's being weaned off
mother's milk.

23
00:03:32.738 --> 00:03:35.699
and Kumu is trying to teach him
how to catch his own food.

24
00:03:37.993 --> 00:03:40.662
It's not easy when the kid is so...

25
00:03:41.872 --> 00:03:43.540
preoccupied all the time.

26
00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:53.425
When it's time to head home.
Kumu has to coax Echo to come with her.

27
00:03:57.053 --> 00:03:59.556
but he is not leaving without that shell.

28
00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.360
Kumu and Echo join up with the rest
of the pod on their way home.

29
00:04:16.698 --> 00:04:19.910
Echo loves his large extended family.

30
00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:22.954
If he could hug them. he would.

31
00:04:23.622 --> 00:04:26.792
but he can't. so he does this instead.

32
00:04:34.132 --> 00:04:37.344
Dolphins crave physical contact
with one another.

33
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.852
They're actually very similar to humans
in many ways.

34
00:04:49.022 --> 00:04:51.441
They talk to each other
in a complex language

35
00:04:51.608 --> 00:04:53.068
of squeaks and clicks.

36
00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:56.530
They even have best friends
they prefer to hang out with.

37
00:05:03.286 --> 00:05:06.957
Teamwork and collaboration
are key to their survival.

38
00:05:13.338 --> 00:05:17.050
Kumu has been trying to teach Echo
some of this group cooperation.

39
00:05:17.884 --> 00:05:19.594
but it takes time and effort.

40
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.348
and Echo is not a model student.

41
00:05:32.148 --> 00:05:35.360
If you really want to understand
someone's upbringing though.

42
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.280
you need to start with their home.

43
00:05:43.577 --> 00:05:45.704
This is Echo's home.

44
00:05:51.376 --> 00:05:55.338
A coral reef that encircles
an entire island.

45
00:06:10.562 --> 00:06:15.609
Echo's favorite pastime
is just cruising the boulevards.

46
00:06:22.282 --> 00:06:26.453
He shares this underwater metropolis
with millions of fellow citizens.

47
00:06:27.537 --> 00:06:31.374
and every single one of them
has its own role to play

48
00:06:31.625 --> 00:06:33.835
in maintaining the health of the reef.

49
00:06:37.422 --> 00:06:40.342
The reef provides a safe haven
for its residents.

50
00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.263
But for Echo.
it's also a welcome distraction

51
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:48.391
from all the pressures
his mom is now placing on him.

52
00:06:54.022 --> 00:06:58.026
To him. this place is like
one big carnival.

53
00:07:19.923 --> 00:07:23.051
Whoa! Here we go. Echo knows this guy.

54
00:07:27.055 --> 00:07:29.391
It's his completely
normal-looking neighbor.

55
00:07:29.933 --> 00:07:31.643
the peacock mantis shrimp.

56
00:07:34.854 --> 00:07:35.981
It's amazing.

57
00:07:36.231 --> 00:07:41.528
These creatures live entirely underwater.
yet seem to be constantly taking showers.

58
00:07:54.374 --> 00:07:57.252
Echo is fascinated
by his eccentric neighbor.

59
00:08:00.213 --> 00:08:02.048
who just so happens to own

60
00:08:02.132 --> 00:08:04.801
one of the best pieces
of real estate on the reef.

61
00:08:09.222 --> 00:08:11.683
And he is obsessive
about keeping it clean.

62
00:08:25.488 --> 00:08:28.950
These rockmover wrasse
do not make his life any easier.

63
00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:33.496
They're very hard workers.

64
00:08:33.913 --> 00:08:38.418
but not the kind of neighbors
you want to invite to a party.

65
00:08:43.006 --> 00:08:44.549
They operate as a team.

66
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:49.012
One lifts up a chunk of debris.
while the other pounces

67
00:08:49.179 --> 00:08:51.139
on whatever prey is hiding underneath.

68
00:08:53.224 --> 00:08:55.769
They do a great job
of stirring up the sediment.

69
00:08:58.605 --> 00:09:00.023
but for Mr. Mantis...

70
00:09:01.566 --> 00:09:04.778
they are the ultimate nightmare neighbors.

71
00:09:14.412 --> 00:09:17.582
It's hard to wrap your head
around the countless interactions

72
00:09:17.749 --> 00:09:20.085
and relationships
that make up this community.

73
00:09:21.586 --> 00:09:25.215
So. here is how the whole reef thing works
in a nutshell.

74
00:09:28.051 --> 00:09:30.011
It all starts with the corals.

75
00:09:30.553 --> 00:09:34.140
They're the foundation
on which this entire living.

76
00:09:34.307 --> 00:09:36.601
breathing city of color is built.

77
00:09:38.394 --> 00:09:39.729
On top of the coral.

78
00:09:40.105 --> 00:09:43.274
millions of extraordinary plants
and creatures grow.

79
00:09:47.737 --> 00:09:50.657
But if left to grow unchecked.

80
00:09:50.907 --> 00:09:54.410
they would literally smother the corals.
and kill the reef.

81
00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.250
So. enter the gardeners.

82
00:10:00.458 --> 00:10:05.255
who eat up all this lush growth.
and prevent it from smothering the corals.

83
00:10:07.966 --> 00:10:09.717
The thing with gardeners is.

84
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.096
they'll eat virtually everything
that grows on the corals.

85
00:10:15.473 --> 00:10:19.519
In fact. if left to their own devices.
they would strip the entire reef

86
00:10:19.686 --> 00:10:21.813
and knock the whole system
out of balance.

87
00:10:27.986 --> 00:10:32.740
So. enter the predators.
who eat the gardener fish.

88
00:10:33.324 --> 00:10:35.910
and prevent them
from stripping the corals.

89
00:10:39.789 --> 00:10:42.500
You may be familiar
with this dramatic character.

90
00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.713
He plays the villain in lots of movies
and TV shows.

91
00:10:47.547 --> 00:10:48.798
but here in reality.

92
00:10:49.549 --> 00:10:53.344
the reef sharks are just doing their part
to maintain the balance of the reef.

93
00:10:57.432 --> 00:10:58.433
Oops! Sorry.

94
00:11:01.686 --> 00:11:03.688
Now. this may be hard to believe.

95
00:11:03.938 --> 00:11:07.192
but dolphins actually play
the exact same role

96
00:11:07.358 --> 00:11:08.985
as sharks in the food chain.

97
00:11:15.033 --> 00:11:18.119
All the same. Echo doesn't like
to be associated with sharks.

98
00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:21.664
They're way too serious.

99
00:11:24.083 --> 00:11:27.420
Echo sees himself
as more of a happy predator.

100
00:11:32.884 --> 00:11:35.720
And who keeps the dolphins
and reef sharks in check?

101
00:11:47.649 --> 00:11:51.778
Meet the tiger shark.
the shark that eats sharks.

102
00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:56.366
And Echo. if he's not careful.

103
00:12:00.203 --> 00:12:03.039
Any reef that loses its sharks is doomed.

104
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:08.211
Damage the community
and you damage the reef.

105
00:12:13.466 --> 00:12:17.512
Here on the outer fringes.
the residents have vanished.

106
00:12:18.554 --> 00:12:20.306
and the reef is dying.

107
00:12:25.979 --> 00:12:30.608
But if all the species of the reef
are left alone to live their lives.

108
00:12:31.985 --> 00:12:34.904
they can keep their home healthy
and in balance.

109
00:12:47.458 --> 00:12:50.545
It's midday. and the reef is still.

110
00:12:54.215 --> 00:12:56.384
The perfect time for a siesta.

111
00:12:59.971 --> 00:13:02.265
One of the amazing things about dolphins

112
00:13:02.849 --> 00:13:05.601
is even when they're asleep.
they have to remember

113
00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:07.937
to keep going to the surface for air.

114
00:13:08.688 --> 00:13:12.066
So. they sleep with only one-half
of their brain at a time.

115
00:13:14.193 --> 00:13:18.072
and they sleep with one eye open
to keep a lookout for danger.

116
00:13:26.289 --> 00:13:27.999
It's synchronized sleeping.

117
00:13:49.604 --> 00:13:52.690
This highly specialized
group sleeping behavior

118
00:13:53.024 --> 00:13:55.568
is essential for dolphins' health
and safety.

119
00:13:58.821 --> 00:14:02.867
But young Echo doesn't always feel
like napping.

120
00:14:05.244 --> 00:14:06.913
He'd rather be exploring.

121
00:14:09.374 --> 00:14:12.085
Good thing he's on his mom's
sleeping eye side.

122
00:14:23.304 --> 00:14:26.557
There's a strange sound
coming from out at sea.

123
00:14:31.604 --> 00:14:32.772
Hmm.

124
00:14:33.314 --> 00:14:38.152
He should probably get back in formation
with the napping grownups.

125
00:14:39.445 --> 00:14:40.822
but he's not going to.

126
00:14:41.823 --> 00:14:44.283
He is going to follow
this mysterious sound

127
00:14:44.867 --> 00:14:46.327
into the deep ocean.

128
00:14:47.787 --> 00:14:49.497
where he's never been before.

129
00:15:11.018 --> 00:15:12.145
Meet Mo'orea.

130
00:15:13.938 --> 00:15:16.274
A 40-foot female humpback whale.

131
00:15:17.442 --> 00:15:20.027
And her newborn calf. Fluke.

132
00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:42.216
Mo'orea has migrated thousands of miles
from the polar regions to give birth

133
00:15:42.383 --> 00:15:45.553
to her daughter
in these warm tropical waters.

134
00:16:04.947 --> 00:16:07.909
Mo'orea has come here every year
since she was born.

135
00:16:09.076 --> 00:16:12.163
but this year. she needs to find
a male partner.

136
00:16:12.747 --> 00:16:16.000
A protector who will help her
keep her calf safe

137
00:16:16.375 --> 00:16:18.836
until it is strong enough
to make the return journey

138
00:16:19.128 --> 00:16:20.713
back to the polar waters.

139
00:16:22.089 --> 00:16:26.260
Just like Echo's pod.
humpbacks find security in numbers.

140
00:16:32.767 --> 00:16:35.186
Echo can't believe his eyes.

141
00:16:37.605 --> 00:16:40.942
At his young age.
he's never been this far out to sea.

142
00:16:41.234 --> 00:16:42.818
So. he's never seen a whale.

143
00:16:54.121 --> 00:16:57.166
Fluke doesn't seem too sure
about this nosy newcomer.

144
00:17:01.128 --> 00:17:03.589
Echo. on the other hand.
is having a blast.

145
00:17:05.591 --> 00:17:08.177
He's just figured out
how to ride the big front wave

146
00:17:08.344 --> 00:17:10.763
Mo'orea creates as she pushes
through the water.

147
00:17:15.893 --> 00:17:20.106
But while Echo is out horsing around.
his mother has come looking for him.

148
00:17:23.067 --> 00:17:26.904
She knows it's not safe for him
to be out in the open ocean by himself.

149
00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:43.963
Kumu calls out for him.

150
00:17:45.172 --> 00:17:47.675
Uh-oh! Echo knows that tone.

151
00:17:55.683 --> 00:17:59.061
If he doesn't learn to stick with the pod
and do what his mother says.

152
00:17:59.478 --> 00:18:01.272
he's putting his life at risk.

153
00:18:09.071 --> 00:18:10.656
Dolphin or whale.

154
00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:13.200
the relationship between a mother
and her calf

155
00:18:13.367 --> 00:18:16.120
is one of the strongest bonds in nature.

156
00:18:24.337 --> 00:18:26.380
Now Mo'orea hears whale sounds.

157
00:18:31.469 --> 00:18:34.722
This is the thing she most wants
to hear right now.

158
00:18:36.474 --> 00:18:38.809
It means protection for her calf.

159
00:18:43.064 --> 00:18:47.401
The source of this reassuring call
is several islands away.

160
00:18:58.412 --> 00:19:02.249
A male humpback.
singing a beautiful whale song.

161
00:19:08.798 --> 00:19:12.218
Like Mo'orea. he's migrated
an enormous distance

162
00:19:12.593 --> 00:19:15.012
from his own faraway polar retreat.

163
00:19:18.933 --> 00:19:21.727
He is going to do everything in his power

164
00:19:21.977 --> 00:19:25.648
to win the right to be Fluke's
and Mo'orea's protector.

165
00:19:29.652 --> 00:19:32.571
His music has drawn in
a fellow male traveler.

166
00:19:33.489 --> 00:19:34.865
a potential rival.

167
00:19:38.994 --> 00:19:40.788
Soon. more males arrive.

168
00:19:41.122 --> 00:19:43.708
Each of them hoping to become
Mo'orea's champion.

169
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.762
Despite their rivalry.
these migratory mammoths

170
00:19:57.012 --> 00:20:01.350
will often come together
after their long journey and dance.

171
00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.238
Every year. they travel to these islands.

172
00:20:57.698 --> 00:21:01.494
Every year. their gathering is magical.

173
00:21:03.287 --> 00:21:07.041
And every year. a champion will emerge.

174
00:21:14.423 --> 00:21:18.135
Not far from Echo's home.
behind a neighboring reef.

175
00:21:19.094 --> 00:21:23.015
there's a quiet sandy area
where the dolphins go to hunt.

176
00:21:35.277 --> 00:21:40.616
Kumu always brings Echo along.
so he can practice and hone his skills.

177
00:21:43.118 --> 00:21:47.414
She needs him to learn how to find
his own food. and soon!

178
00:21:48.332 --> 00:21:50.125
Or he won't make it to adulthood.

179
00:21:54.255 --> 00:21:58.968
Dolphins use a highly sophisticated
kind of sonar. called echolocation.

180
00:21:59.677 --> 00:22:02.763
that allows them to locate things
buried under the sand.

181
00:22:10.062 --> 00:22:13.774
This kind of pinpoint detection
takes years to master.

182
00:22:16.944 --> 00:22:19.822
And Echo still hasn't figured it out.

183
00:22:21.991 --> 00:22:23.868
Everyone else is having success.

184
00:22:34.336 --> 00:22:36.547
As they all head to the surface for air.

185
00:22:38.048 --> 00:22:41.594
the hidden tasty treats
finally reveal themselves:

186
00:22:44.054 --> 00:22:45.097
Razorfish!

187
00:22:47.182 --> 00:22:49.268
Sneaky little devils.

188
00:22:51.478 --> 00:22:54.607
When no one's around.
it's like a party down there.

189
00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.409
But when Echo dives down
to try to catch one.

190
00:23:05.951 --> 00:23:06.952
poof!

191
00:23:14.251 --> 00:23:16.545
He's got the echolocation part down.

192
00:23:17.212 --> 00:23:19.506
it's his follow-through
he's got to work on.

193
00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:27.389
Oh! Oh! I got one!

194
00:23:28.807 --> 00:23:29.808
Or not.

195
00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:33.228
Ah. so close.

196
00:23:34.229 --> 00:23:35.522
Here. Watch your mom.

197
00:23:37.775 --> 00:23:40.361
You got to feel the Razorfish.

198
00:23:40.486 --> 00:23:43.402
and boom. see?

199
00:23:47.326 --> 00:23:48.327
Try again.

200
00:23:50.496 --> 00:23:53.165
Yes. No. Oh. Echo!

201
00:23:58.045 --> 00:24:01.382
And that's about the limit
of his attention span.

202
00:24:10.265 --> 00:24:13.352
Back at the reef.
more trouble for Mr. Mantis.

203
00:24:16.105 --> 00:24:18.357
His whole neighborhood is in a shambles.

204
00:24:24.738 --> 00:24:28.409
There's only so much tidying and arranging
a mantis shrimp can do.

205
00:24:32.246 --> 00:24:35.708
Clearly. the gardeners in this area
have not been doing their jobs.

206
00:24:37.376 --> 00:24:41.588
The reef is falling out of balance.
and the corals are dying.

207
00:24:44.675 --> 00:24:48.053
At a time like this.
the community needs a hero.

208
00:24:50.806 --> 00:24:52.516
But who will emerge as a savior?

209
00:24:52.933 --> 00:24:56.395
Who will step forward
and put duty before self?

210
00:24:58.147 --> 00:25:01.191
The bumphead parrotfish.
that's who.

211
00:25:16.749 --> 00:25:21.378
Parrotfish. believe it or not.
are the single most important creatures

212
00:25:21.712 --> 00:25:24.465
when it comes to protecting
the health of the reef.

213
00:25:26.592 --> 00:25:29.470
They chomp up dead
and algae-covered coral.

214
00:25:30.262 --> 00:25:34.433
allowing fresh coral to grow in its place
and rebuild the reef.

215
00:25:38.854 --> 00:25:44.234
Without parrotfish.
the entire reef would die very quickly.

216
00:25:45.527 --> 00:25:48.739
So. every creature who depends
on the reef for survival.

217
00:25:49.045 --> 00:25:53.869
including Mr. Mantis.
owes its life to the parrotfish.

218
00:25:57.581 --> 00:25:59.625
Now. if you chomp coral all day.

219
00:26:00.334 --> 00:26:02.461
you swallow a lot of rock.

220
00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:07.424
and the rock turns into sand poop.

221
00:26:24.483 --> 00:26:29.738
A single parrotfish can produce
five tons of sand per year.

222
00:26:31.532 --> 00:26:33.408
Five tons.

223
00:26:37.704 --> 00:26:38.914
Given enough time.

224
00:26:39.456 --> 00:26:42.501
parrotfish can poop
entire tropical beaches.

225
00:26:46.296 --> 00:26:48.757
It may be great
for replenishing the sediment.

226
00:26:49.383 --> 00:26:51.718
but raining sand poop from above

227
00:26:52.052 --> 00:26:54.930
is generally a bad thing for neat freaks.

228
00:27:02.396 --> 00:27:03.981
To make matters worse.

229
00:27:04.231 --> 00:27:07.609
all the sand has attracted a squatter
on the front lawn.

230
00:27:15.492 --> 00:27:19.538
You probably think old Mr. Mantis here
is just a harmless homebody.

231
00:27:20.706 --> 00:27:22.457
but you would be mistaken.

232
00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:24.751
See these two clubs?

233
00:27:25.919 --> 00:27:27.921
You do not wanna mess with these.

234
00:27:39.183 --> 00:27:40.392
You want some more. pal?

235
00:27:41.185 --> 00:27:42.519
Yeah?

236
00:27:46.106 --> 00:27:50.277
Mantis shrimp have the fastest.
most powerful predatory strike

237
00:27:50.444 --> 00:27:52.613
of any creature in the ocean.

238
00:27:53.113 --> 00:27:56.867
If humans could hit this hard.
they could punch through steel.

239
00:27:59.661 --> 00:28:00.787
Stay off my lawn!

240
00:28:08.128 --> 00:28:09.129
Oh. no.

241
00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:13.300
The commotion has attracted
some very unwanted attention.

242
00:28:21.642 --> 00:28:24.269
It's the reef's most insidious resident.

243
00:28:29.691 --> 00:28:32.736
The strange and mysterious
broadclub cuttlefish.

244
00:28:38.408 --> 00:28:41.995
The creatures of the reef know very little
about this monster.

245
00:28:43.497 --> 00:28:46.458
Probably because most of the encounters
creatures have with it

246
00:28:46.708 --> 00:28:48.961
are the last encounters they ever have.

247
00:28:52.547 --> 00:28:55.717
It has miraculous. mesmerizing powers.

248
00:28:56.885 --> 00:28:59.596
Its skin flashes like a strobe.

249
00:29:00.347 --> 00:29:02.391
hypnotizing its prey.

250
00:29:18.699 --> 00:29:20.450
You don't mess with a cuttlefish.

251
00:29:27.082 --> 00:29:28.667
Off the edge of the reef.

252
00:29:29.126 --> 00:29:32.087
a new menacing sound rings out
in the distance.

253
00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:39.928
Orcas.

254
00:29:42.556 --> 00:29:45.517
They're approaching the islands.
looking for prey.

255
00:29:49.813 --> 00:29:52.316
They are the ocean's greatest hunters.

256
00:29:55.902 --> 00:29:58.280
They specialize in hunting dolphins.

257
00:30:00.824 --> 00:30:02.326
And whale calves.

258
00:30:11.626 --> 00:30:14.171
Mo'orea hears the orcas' cries as well.

259
00:30:15.589 --> 00:30:17.591
They are a direct threat to Fluke.

260
00:30:20.677 --> 00:30:23.889
It's time for her to make contact
with the male humpbacks.

261
00:30:37.486 --> 00:30:40.489
The sound travels from miles
across the ocean.

262
00:30:42.991 --> 00:30:44.785
A male hears her call and responds.

263
00:30:47.704 --> 00:30:48.997
Another male joins in.

264
00:30:50.624 --> 00:30:51.625
then another.

265
00:30:54.127 --> 00:30:56.838
All of them are letting Mo'orea know
they're here for her.

266
00:31:21.405 --> 00:31:25.534
Mo'orea's goal is to draw the males in.
and find the strongest of them.

267
00:31:28.412 --> 00:31:31.373
He will help her defend her calf
against the orcas.

268
00:31:34.543 --> 00:31:37.546
Her call triggers a massive response
from the male humpbacks.

269
00:31:43.301 --> 00:31:45.011
They all begin racing toward her.

270
00:31:59.401 --> 00:32:01.945
As they build up speed.
they trumpet their fervor

271
00:32:02.154 --> 00:32:04.239
with huge streams of bubbles.

272
00:32:10.412 --> 00:32:14.541
The great contest
to be Mo'orea's champion has begun.

273
00:32:34.102 --> 00:32:35.479
It's cleaning day on the reef...

274
00:32:37.272 --> 00:32:38.940
and not just for Mr. Mantis.

275
00:32:41.318 --> 00:32:44.321
Kumu is bringing Echo
to a very special cleaning spot

276
00:32:44.863 --> 00:32:47.324
to take part
in an ancient dolphin ritual.

277
00:32:57.459 --> 00:33:00.295
This unique coral is called a gorgonian.

278
00:33:00.712 --> 00:33:03.715
and it only grows in this one spot
on the reef.

279
00:33:11.848 --> 00:33:14.309
It feels fantastic on the skin.

280
00:33:15.519 --> 00:33:17.187
But that's not why it's so special.

281
00:33:19.439 --> 00:33:21.733
Some corals have medicinal properties.

282
00:33:35.413 --> 00:33:38.333
Dolphins get cuts and bites
that can become infected.

283
00:33:39.125 --> 00:33:43.672
but gorgonians like these have chemicals
that help heal skin infections.

284
00:33:58.853 --> 00:34:01.481
Echo needs a lot more
than just mom's herbal remedies

285
00:34:01.648 --> 00:34:02.649
to survive though.

286
00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:07.529
A clean body
doesn't do you much good.

287
00:34:07.977 --> 00:34:10.352
if you still haven't learned
to feed yourself.

288
00:34:19.416 --> 00:34:22.502
The practice of personal hygiene
is a whole different ordeal

289
00:34:22.669 --> 00:34:25.338
for the bumphead parrotfish.

290
00:34:25.589 --> 00:34:29.301
Being the savior of marine kind
carries a cost.

291
00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.429
Their teeth become filthy.

292
00:34:34.431 --> 00:34:38.435
So. every day. they travel
to what's called a cleaning station.

293
00:34:38.935 --> 00:34:42.731
where a tiny cleaner wrasse
remove parasites and debris

294
00:34:42.897 --> 00:34:44.357
from all over their bodies.

295
00:34:46.276 --> 00:34:47.944
It's a bit invasive.

296
00:34:49.154 --> 00:34:51.156
but it's essential for their health.

297
00:34:56.494 --> 00:34:59.748
The customers have to wait in line here
at the cleaning station.

298
00:35:01.374 --> 00:35:04.836
Entire shoals of fish
are lining up for service.

299
00:35:09.382 --> 00:35:12.260
The wrasse cater
to a wide variety of clients

300
00:35:12.844 --> 00:35:14.304
from all across the reef.

301
00:35:18.141 --> 00:35:19.893
And there's an unwritten rule here.

302
00:35:21.436 --> 00:35:22.771
no eating the help.

303
00:35:28.276 --> 00:35:30.654
This little guy is off
to his own cleaning station.

304
00:35:35.825 --> 00:35:37.827
Welcome to turtle rock.

305
00:35:53.718 --> 00:35:55.261
He's trying to find a good spot.

306
00:35:55.428 --> 00:35:58.723
but space is very limited here
on cleaning day.

307
00:36:02.143 --> 00:36:06.898
And unlike the wrasse cleaning station.
turtles hate waiting in line.

308
00:36:11.486 --> 00:36:13.446
Oh. boy. turtle fight.

309
00:36:18.993 --> 00:36:20.829
Ugh. now. he'll never get a spot.

310
00:36:45.061 --> 00:36:48.273
The crotchety. old guys
finally swim off in a huff.

311
00:36:49.774 --> 00:36:52.152
clearing the way for our little friend.

312
00:37:02.829 --> 00:37:04.581
Mmm.

313
00:37:11.796 --> 00:37:15.383
Mo'orea. on the other hand.
cannot afford to relax right now.

314
00:37:16.718 --> 00:37:20.305
She and Fluke are still alone
and vulnerable on the open ocean.

315
00:37:23.016 --> 00:37:27.270
Luckily. there's company on the way.

316
00:37:28.897 --> 00:37:30.023
Lots of company.

317
00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:38.198
Mo'orea's calls have sparked the fire
of competition.

318
00:37:38.573 --> 00:37:40.784
and the males are stampeding
toward her.

319
00:37:52.879 --> 00:37:54.881
As they catch up
with the mother and calf.

320
00:37:55.298 --> 00:37:58.051
the great contest
that this has all been building toward

321
00:37:58.426 --> 00:37:59.719
finally begins.

322
00:38:03.139 --> 00:38:06.893
Now. it's time to prove to Mo'orea
who is the strongest.

323
00:38:23.117 --> 00:38:27.497
These 40-ton giants crash into each other.
and try to push each other down.

324
00:38:31.292 --> 00:38:32.669
Smashing and splashing.

325
00:38:33.294 --> 00:38:36.256
each of them vying
to be Mo'orea's trusty protector.

326
00:39:04.617 --> 00:39:07.412
When the long grueling contest is over.

327
00:39:08.204 --> 00:39:12.417
the last challenger sinks.
exhausted beneath the waves.

328
00:39:19.591 --> 00:39:22.302
And a single victor remains.

329
00:39:51.581 --> 00:39:55.589
Mo'orea now has her champion.

330
00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:58.421
the strongest of the male humpbacks.

331
00:39:59.088 --> 00:40:01.257
to help her protect Fluke from the orcas.

332
00:40:22.612 --> 00:40:25.573
It's been a long. tiring day for Echo...

333
00:40:28.284 --> 00:40:29.702
But Kumu is on edge.

334
00:40:31.454 --> 00:40:33.706
She hears dolphins chattering.

335
00:40:40.755 --> 00:40:42.966
These are unfamiliar voices to Echo.

336
00:40:47.387 --> 00:40:49.430
Outsiders have arrived on the reef.

337
00:40:54.102 --> 00:40:58.356
Sometimes. groups of males will gang up
on other isolated dolphins.

338
00:41:04.821 --> 00:41:08.449
This is not a good time for Echo
and his mom to be caught alone.

339
00:41:13.454 --> 00:41:15.665
The intruders spot them and attack.

340
00:41:18.418 --> 00:41:22.463
Echo sticks close to his mother's side
as she turns to face her attackers.

341
00:41:29.554 --> 00:41:31.848
Echo is bitten and rammed repeatedly.

342
00:41:41.441 --> 00:41:43.401
Kumu cries out to him to run away...

343
00:41:53.369 --> 00:41:54.746
But Kumu is surrounded.

344
00:42:03.921 --> 00:42:08.342
Then. from out of the blue.
Echo's pod has come to the rescue.

345
00:42:17.602 --> 00:42:19.062
They repel the attackers.

346
00:42:30.031 --> 00:42:31.157
But where is Echo?

347
00:42:33.785 --> 00:42:35.078
His mom whistles to him.

348
00:42:41.626 --> 00:42:42.794
There's no reply.

349
00:43:14.784 --> 00:43:19.455
Kumu and the rest of the pod spend hours
searching for Echo in the storm.

350
00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:36.347
But as darkness takes hold. Echo is lost.

351
00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:51.195
He's never been alone
at nighttime before.

352
00:43:54.574 --> 00:43:55.783
This is not good.

353
00:43:58.077 --> 00:44:02.582
Night is when the hunters come out.

354
00:44:13.467 --> 00:44:16.637
Lionfish.

355
00:44:19.432 --> 00:44:24.228
Their ghostly fins and venomous spines
hide their shape from their prey.

356
00:45:07.605 --> 00:45:10.191
The sharks are gathering
for their night patrol.

357
00:45:12.151 --> 00:45:15.196
to clear the reef of residents
who are weak or sick.

358
00:45:22.161 --> 00:45:24.163
But even the healthy residents hide...

359
00:45:25.831 --> 00:45:26.832
just in case.

360
00:45:56.821 --> 00:45:58.322
The sharks work as a team.

361
00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:03.202
Waiting until they have sufficient numbers
before springing their attack.

362
00:46:09.667 --> 00:46:11.669
This seems way more than sufficient.

363
00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:22.930
The nervous fish panic
and abandon their hiding spots.

364
00:46:24.849 --> 00:46:26.183
Terrible idea.

365
00:46:33.482 --> 00:46:35.818
Echo wants no part of this.

366
00:47:18.277 --> 00:47:21.489
Echo is forced to flee into a dark canyon.

367
00:47:23.407 --> 00:47:24.742
He's completely lost...

368
00:47:26.118 --> 00:47:27.620
and completely alone.

369
00:47:50.393 --> 00:47:53.479
Without his mother or his pod
to guide him to safety.

370
00:47:54.855 --> 00:47:56.440
Echo follows this turtle.

371
00:48:19.255 --> 00:48:23.134
They descend into a deep.
hidden labyrinth.

372
00:48:41.777 --> 00:48:46.407
Echo is enveloped by the neon lights
of an alien underworld.

373
00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:16.270
Now they sink even deeper.

374
00:49:18.314 --> 00:49:20.983
farther and farther away from the surface.

375
00:49:38.792 --> 00:49:42.796
Turtles who get trapped down here
suffocate and drown.

376
00:49:53.224 --> 00:49:54.892
They're both running out of air.

377
00:50:04.693 --> 00:50:06.487
There! There's moonlight.

378
00:50:47.111 --> 00:50:48.779
Dawn at last.

379
00:50:52.324 --> 00:50:56.912
Echo's mom has been searching
and calling out for him all night.

380
00:51:13.137 --> 00:51:14.930
Finally. she finds him.

381
00:51:26.317 --> 00:51:30.821
Being lost in an ocean at night
gives you a whole new appreciation

382
00:51:30.988 --> 00:51:31.989
for your mother.

383
00:51:35.576 --> 00:51:38.120
It's also been a huge wakeup call
for Echo.

384
00:51:39.747 --> 00:51:40.789
Time has run out.

385
00:51:41.832 --> 00:51:45.252
he simply cannot rely on Kumu
to take care of him anymore.

386
00:51:47.588 --> 00:51:51.091
He's going to have to learn from her
how to take care of himself...

387
00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:54.049
once and for all.

388
00:51:56.722 --> 00:51:59.933
Kumu is going to take Echo
on the ultimate fishing trip.

389
00:52:00.559 --> 00:52:02.895
to the pod's favorite
group hunting ground.

390
00:52:03.395 --> 00:52:05.648
the legendary muddy shallows.

391
00:52:14.657 --> 00:52:17.451
They're not waiting around for the rest
of the group today. though.

392
00:52:18.285 --> 00:52:19.453
They need to get to work.

393
00:52:20.287 --> 00:52:22.873
There's some critical skills
Echo needs to learn

394
00:52:23.248 --> 00:52:24.541
before the others get there.

395
00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:40.683
The first stop on their journey
is Banzai Beach.

396
00:52:45.145 --> 00:52:49.900
Here. Kumu is going to teach Echo
her special trick for corralling fish.

397
00:53:10.087 --> 00:53:12.381
She's developed
a unique sprinting technique

398
00:53:12.798 --> 00:53:14.258
that is key to the whole thing.

399
00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:28.147
With this high-speed hydroplaning.
she shows Echo

400
00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:30.482
how you can actually outmaneuver
the fish.

401
00:53:30.899 --> 00:53:33.110
and force them to go
where you want them to.

402
00:53:40.056 --> 00:53:43.162
The trick is to not get yourself beached.

403
00:53:54.047 --> 00:53:58.135
This shallow. high-speed corralling tactic
is no easy feat.

404
00:53:59.094 --> 00:54:02.264
but Echo will need to master it
if he's going to have any success

405
00:54:02.431 --> 00:54:03.557
at the muddy shallows.

406
00:54:08.729 --> 00:54:12.191
Next. Kumu needs to take Echo across
the small channel.

407
00:54:13.358 --> 00:54:16.403
But this is not a good time to be out
on the open water.

408
00:54:22.201 --> 00:54:24.453
The orcas are combing the islands.

409
00:54:28.457 --> 00:54:30.834
And they're shifting into stealth mode.

410
00:54:37.674 --> 00:54:42.221
They hunt without making a sound.
so their prey won't hear them coming.

411
00:54:52.731 --> 00:54:54.608
While they're silently stalking.

412
00:54:55.692 --> 00:55:00.489
they're also listening
for every little squeak and splash.

413
00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:17.047
They make it across the channel.

414
00:55:18.590 --> 00:55:22.219
but now. they have to pass through
a mysterious murky area.

415
00:55:44.338 --> 00:55:46.285
Paranoia rules here.

416
00:55:53.417 --> 00:55:55.878
But what on earth are they so afraid of?

417
00:55:58.755 --> 00:56:02.384
Oh. right. Giant stingrays.

418
00:56:08.056 --> 00:56:11.393
Kumu knows that these guys
can actually be helpful though.

419
00:56:12.436 --> 00:56:16.899
Stingrays hunt using electrical sensors
that dolphins don't have.

420
00:56:18.525 --> 00:56:23.071
So. if you follow one. it can lead you
to food that's buried in the sand.

421
00:56:26.283 --> 00:56:29.244
But Echo needs to be very wary
of these creatures.

422
00:56:30.579 --> 00:56:33.624
If they strike you
with that razor-sharp venomous tail.

423
00:56:34.041 --> 00:56:35.042
it's all over.

424
00:56:41.048 --> 00:56:46.803
Echo needs to learn how to catch food.
but this is no place for beginners.

425
00:57:04.321 --> 00:57:07.908
At last. Echo and his mom
arrive at their destination.

426
00:57:09.034 --> 00:57:11.078
the legendary muddy shallows.

427
00:57:11.954 --> 00:57:13.664
for Echo's greatest test.

428
00:57:16.013 --> 00:57:20.738
Here. he will need to really focus
and learn his mother's craft.

429
00:57:24.299 --> 00:57:28.053
There was a time when this bird
would have completely distracted Echo.

430
00:57:30.305 --> 00:57:32.724
but since his recent
scary nighttime ordeal.

431
00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:35.394
and his renewed commitment
to following his mother's...

432
00:57:36.645 --> 00:57:38.642
Oh. never mind.

433
00:57:40.899 --> 00:57:42.567
Can we get back to the lesson. please?

434
00:57:51.618 --> 00:57:56.415
Now. Kumu is going to teach Echo
her most advanced hunting technique.

435
00:57:58.125 --> 00:58:00.043
if he can pay attention long enough.

436
00:58:02.129 --> 00:58:04.047
It's an extremely rare maneuver.

437
00:58:04.548 --> 00:58:06.925
that combines all the skills
she's been teaching him.

438
00:58:09.553 --> 00:58:11.013
She starts out slow.

439
00:58:12.055 --> 00:58:15.684
then turns on the power thrusters.
just like she did at the beach.

440
00:58:17.352 --> 00:58:19.521
She kicks up the mud in a perfect circle.

441
00:58:31.408 --> 00:58:35.495
She does one more. so.
Echo can really observe the technique.

442
00:58:46.798 --> 00:58:49.509
Okay. Now. it's Echo's turn.

443
00:58:56.058 --> 00:58:58.018
Good. keep turning.

444
00:58:59.478 --> 00:59:01.271
Other way. Ah!

445
00:59:02.355 --> 00:59:03.356
One more time.

446
00:59:05.442 --> 00:59:06.443
Yup.

447
00:59:07.319 --> 00:59:08.320
No.

448
00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:15.994
Looks like Echo just isn't getting it.

449
00:59:26.838 --> 00:59:29.758
Wait a minute. this one looks good.

450
00:59:32.969 --> 00:59:34.513
A perfect mud ring.

451
00:59:40.852 --> 00:59:44.314
It's a big achievement.
but the job's not done yet.

452
00:59:45.129 --> 00:59:46.817
They need the rest of the pod now.

453
00:59:47.901 --> 00:59:50.445
The next part requires serious teamwork.

454
01:00:02.624 --> 01:00:04.543
Echo is safe in the shallows now.

455
01:00:05.710 --> 01:00:09.256
But Mo'orea and her calf are still exposed
on the open water.

456
01:00:27.774 --> 01:00:30.152
The orcas have found Mo'orea and Fluke.

457
01:00:38.451 --> 01:00:42.372
Mo'orea realizes they've been ambushed.
and braces for a fight.

458
01:00:44.958 --> 01:00:47.586
She strikes out at the attackers
with her tail.

459
01:00:50.881 --> 01:00:53.842
Fluke rides up onto her mother's back
for protection.

460
01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:04.060
But where is Mo'orea's champion?

461
01:01:06.771 --> 01:01:08.565
Fluke is barely hanging on.

462
01:01:18.783 --> 01:01:20.493
The orcas are relentless.

463
01:01:21.036 --> 01:01:24.372
They rush past creating waves
to knock Fluke off.

464
01:01:33.673 --> 01:01:37.677
At last. the male champion arrives
to defend his new family.

465
01:01:56.696 --> 01:02:00.408
With two adults. Fluke is protected
on both sides.

466
01:02:07.123 --> 01:02:12.087
The orcas regroup and attack head on.
to split the humpbacks' defenses.

467
01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:19.219
Working as a pack. they overwhelm
the mother and calf.

468
01:02:21.304 --> 01:02:23.556
The humpbacks are losing the fight.

469
01:02:28.770 --> 01:02:33.233
Then. Mo'orea's champion begins slamming
his tail against the water.

470
01:02:39.114 --> 01:02:41.032
It's a call to arms.

471
01:02:43.326 --> 01:02:45.787
He's reaching out to his defeated rivals.

472
01:02:48.748 --> 01:02:50.083
In times of crisis.

473
01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:53.753
humpbacks rise above their differences.
and band together.

474
01:02:57.897 --> 01:03:00.072
The males charge to the rescue.

475
01:03:02.012 --> 01:03:03.596
But will they make it in time?

476
01:03:06.308 --> 01:03:08.351
Fluke won't last much longer.

477
01:03:25.410 --> 01:03:27.996
Fluke is struggling to stay on top
of her mother.

478
01:03:28.243 --> 01:03:30.623
It's the only safe place left for her.

479
01:03:42.677 --> 01:03:44.971
Finally. the rescue pod arrives.

480
01:03:49.142 --> 01:03:52.729
Now. Mo'orea and Fluke are protected
on all sides.

481
01:04:06.493 --> 01:04:09.788
Not even orcas stand a chance
against a herd of humpbacks

482
01:04:09.954 --> 01:04:11.414
when they're working together.

483
01:04:15.835 --> 01:04:17.837
The attackers are forced to flee...

484
01:04:19.547 --> 01:04:20.548
empty handed.

485
01:04:30.308 --> 01:04:33.520
For Mo'orea. this victory is a vindication

486
01:04:33.686 --> 01:04:37.023
of the long journey she makes every year
to these islands.

487
01:04:39.150 --> 01:04:44.280
This annual tradition of migration.
competition and collaboration

488
01:04:44.739 --> 01:04:47.033
is precisely what kept her calf safe.

489
01:04:48.910 --> 01:04:51.413
Fluke owes her life
to her fellow humpbacks

490
01:04:51.579 --> 01:04:52.747
who've journeyed here.

491
01:05:09.347 --> 01:05:12.392
Echo's pod have now come to join him
and his mom

492
01:05:12.559 --> 01:05:15.437
at the muddy shallows for the big hunt.

493
01:05:18.857 --> 01:05:22.819
This is Echo's chance
to show off everything he's learned.

494
01:05:27.838 --> 01:05:30.563
They all fan out across the lagoon.

495
01:05:34.747 --> 01:05:37.459
Kumu takes Echo and breaks away
from the group.

496
01:05:38.042 --> 01:05:40.086
hunting for the elusive treasure.

497
01:05:55.768 --> 01:05:57.395
Then. Echo spots it.

498
01:05:58.396 --> 01:05:59.898
A big shoal of fish.

499
01:06:02.025 --> 01:06:05.278
This is where Kumu's corralling tactic
comes into play.

500
01:06:07.447 --> 01:06:10.783
He charges in
and paints a perfect mud ring.

501
01:06:11.159 --> 01:06:12.660
just like his mother taught him.

502
01:06:16.164 --> 01:06:21.920
Then suddenly. the fish trapped inside
the ring try to escape by leaping out.

503
01:06:23.087 --> 01:06:26.090
straight into the jaws of Echo
and his mom.

504
01:06:27.865 --> 01:06:30.915
This was the whole purpose
of the mud ringing.

505
01:06:33.746 --> 01:06:37.221
The rest of the pod races over to join
the hunt.

506
01:06:41.689 --> 01:06:43.525
Echo fires up another mud ring.

507
01:06:49.322 --> 01:06:53.785
The other dolphins help coral the fish.
straight into Echo's trap.

508
01:06:55.943 --> 01:06:58.993
And this time. they all share the bounty.

509
01:08:08.568 --> 01:08:13.698
Mr. Mantis is adding the final touches
to his broken coral masterpiece.

510
01:08:14.866 --> 01:08:17.243
Hmm. Let's see.

511
01:08:18.286 --> 01:08:20.538
Ah! He knows what he needs.

512
01:08:22.165 --> 01:08:23.791
He needs more broken coral.

513
01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:28.171
to throw on top of his other broken coral.

514
01:08:34.344 --> 01:08:35.386
Oh. no.

515
01:08:37.221 --> 01:08:40.808
The master of disguise sneaks up
on the mantis.

516
01:08:41.142 --> 01:08:44.062
and activates his coral camouflage.

517
01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:51.986
Just put this coral here next
to this other coral.

518
01:09:03.039 --> 01:09:05.750
The mantis can sense
something's not right...

519
01:09:08.586 --> 01:09:09.754
but it's too late.

520
01:09:24.602 --> 01:09:29.273
The mantis is transfixed
by the pulsating blob of death.

521
01:09:48.876 --> 01:09:51.379
But wait. Echo is back from the shallows.

522
01:09:53.881 --> 01:09:56.134
Cuttlefish don't have many predators.

523
01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:59.137
but dolphins are one of them.

524
01:10:14.569 --> 01:10:16.696
Echo has finally come of age.

525
01:10:17.655 --> 01:10:21.284
and no longer has to rely solely
on his mother to provide for him.

526
01:10:23.369 --> 01:10:25.872
He's become a valued member
of his community.

527
01:10:29.625 --> 01:10:31.085
When everyone plays their part.

528
01:10:32.170 --> 01:10:33.671
the community thrives.

529
01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:40.470
All around the world.

530
01:10:40.887 --> 01:10:43.139
there are countless stories
just like these.

531
01:10:46.017 --> 01:10:49.979
The tale of this reef. is just a microcosm
of the epic saga

532
01:10:50.146 --> 01:10:52.690
that encompasses all of earth's oceans.

533
01:10:56.402 --> 01:10:58.321
The intricate natural balance.

534
01:10:58.738 --> 01:11:01.657
that holds Echo's tiny isolated reef
together.

535
01:11:02.366 --> 01:11:05.661
is the same balance
that keeps all marine communities

536
01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:06.954
alive and healthy.

537
01:11:13.628 --> 01:11:15.463
Both Fluke and Echo

538
01:11:15.838 --> 01:11:21.636
rely on their remarkable extended families
for comfort. safety. and survival.

539
01:11:28.014 --> 01:11:31.314
And now. they need to rely on us as well.

540
01:11:34.867 --> 01:11:37.902
Their world is our world.

541
01:12:53.269 --> 01:12:54.729
Woo-hoo!
