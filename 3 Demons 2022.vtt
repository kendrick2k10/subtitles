3
00:00:40.413 --> 00:00:42.215
This is Dr. Evelyn Sawyer.

4
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.415
The date is March 13.

5
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.849
I'm here with James
Fisher. prisoner ID B1359.

6
00:00:49.884 --> 00:00:51.422
Continuing
psychological assessment

7
00:00:51.457 --> 00:00:56.724
for criminal court
case 21-1-90305

8
00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:58.099
at the behest of the state.

9
00:01:04.932 --> 00:01:06.767
James. I need a few
more details about what

10
00:01:06.802 --> 00:01:09.275
took place last summer.

11
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.376
Sounds great.

12
00:01:11.411 --> 00:01:13.180
This is the last time.

13
00:01:13.215 --> 00:01:14.874
I promise.

14
00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.515
I feel like I've
heard that before.

15
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.221
I'd like to talk
about motivation.

16
00:01:21.256 --> 00:01:23.388
Can we start with
the assignment?

17
00:01:23.423 --> 00:01:25.456
Sure.

18
00:01:25.491 --> 00:01:27.293
OK.

19
00:01:27.328 --> 00:01:32.595
In your own words. please
describe it for me.

20
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.531
I was instructed
to protect a body.

21
00:01:40.308 --> 00:01:42.374
Did anything seem
out of the ordinary.

22
00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.213
either about the assignment
or anything in general?

23
00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.321
I'm trying to help you James.

24
00:01:55.356 --> 00:01:55.783
Are you?

25
00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:00.623
I'm your last chance
to save yourself.

26
00:02:06.433 --> 00:02:08.334
All of it.

27
00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:08.796
Excuse me?

28
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.244
All of it felt out
of the ordinary.

29
00:02:25.683 --> 00:02:27.650
Winters left.

30
00:02:27.685 --> 00:02:29.916
Broke protocol.

31
00:02:29.951 --> 00:02:31.291
And I didn't have a vehicle.

32
00:02:35.396 --> 00:02:37.297
Don't stop.

33
00:02:37.332 --> 00:02:38.826
We're close.

34
00:02:38.861 --> 00:02:40.300
You've got to keep digging.

35
00:02:54.547 --> 00:02:57.680
What did you just say?

36
00:02:57.715 --> 00:03:00.617
You're holding something back.

37
00:03:00.652 --> 00:03:01.552
Help me see it.

38
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.325
Help you see it?

39
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:11.298
OK.

40
00:03:26.876 --> 00:03:31.582
This is MAtia Ableman. 43.

41
00:03:31.617 --> 00:03:34.519
Hikers found her last night.

42
00:03:34.554 --> 00:03:37.753
Lucky they did. people don't
come through here often.

43
00:03:37.788 --> 00:03:38.919
What the hell was she doing?

44
00:03:43.057 --> 00:03:45.761
When does the coroner get here?

45
00:03:45.796 --> 00:03:47.532
Hes doesn't.

46
00:03:47.567 --> 00:03:49.600
What?

47
00:03:49.635 --> 00:03:51.030
Why not?

48
00:03:51.065 --> 00:03:52.867
When we notified
her family they said

49
00:03:52.902 --> 00:03:54.737
they needed to come pick her up.

50
00:03:54.772 --> 00:03:56.574
Nobody else.

51
00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.378
Can they do that?

52
00:03:58.413 --> 00:04:01.579
According to their
lawyer they can.

53
00:04:01.614 --> 00:04:05.748
But the ME said that she
died from natural causes.

54
00:04:05.783 --> 00:04:08.751
so it doesn't really matter.

55
00:04:08.786 --> 00:04:14.889
So we just hang out
and babysit a DB?

56
00:04:14.924 --> 00:04:17.463
Yep.

57
00:04:17.498 --> 00:04:20.829
Family was adamant that nothing
happen to her until then.

58
00:04:20.864 --> 00:04:24.030
Happens to her?

59
00:04:24.065 --> 00:04:26.670
What else could happen
to her. she's dead.

60
00:04:26.705 --> 00:04:28.540
No disrespect.

61
00:04:28.575 --> 00:04:31.576
For Christ sake's Fisher.

62
00:04:31.611 --> 00:04:33.644
They asked us to watch
her so we watch her.

63
00:04:46.593 --> 00:04:48.087
You OK?

64
00:04:48.122 --> 00:04:49.594
Yeah.

65
00:04:50.432 --> 00:04:50.793
Fine.

66
00:04:53.831 --> 00:04:55.600
Is there something
you're not telling me?

67
00:04:58.803 --> 00:04:59.406
Sure?

68
00:05:02.807 --> 00:05:03.410
No.

69
00:05:06.811 --> 00:05:09.449
It's just really odd.

70
00:05:11.717 --> 00:05:13.079
The way that they said it.

71
00:05:15.622 --> 00:05:20.020
There was real urgency.

72
00:05:23.828 --> 00:05:26.994
Protect the body.

73
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.899
They emphasized
that a few times.

74
00:05:31.165 --> 00:05:33.539
Protect the body from what?

75
00:05:34.641 --> 00:05:36.509
I don't know.

76
00:05:37.138 --> 00:05:38.137
They didn't say.

77
00:05:38.172 --> 00:05:39.380
You didn't ask?

78
00:05:53.022 --> 00:05:55.121
Look Fisher. if
this was your sister

79
00:05:55.156 --> 00:05:56.496
would you want her
out here alone?

80
00:06:00.535 --> 00:06:02.502
It's the least we could do.

81
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:04.834
That is the job.

82
00:06:06.772 --> 00:06:08.442
Serve and Protect.

83
00:06:32.567 --> 00:06:35.568
This is Mobile Unit
1. copy that 10-96.

84
00:06:35.603 --> 00:06:36.536
Is this a Code 1?

85
00:06:36.571 --> 00:06:36.932
Over.

86
00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:38.736
Code 1.

87
00:06:38.771 --> 00:06:39.503
Over.

88
00:06:41.268 --> 00:06:42.773
We gotta get these
planes for Lucy.

89
00:06:42.808 --> 00:06:44.544
Come on.

90
00:06:44.579 --> 00:06:46.612
Dig.

91
00:06:46.647 --> 00:06:47.943
All right Fisher.
looks like you're

92
00:06:47.978 --> 00:06:50.748
going to have to keep
watch until I get back.

93
00:06:51.113 --> 00:06:52.750
Wait. what?

94
00:06:58.252 --> 00:06:58.855
Alone?

95
00:07:03.961 --> 00:07:06.533
Looks like it.

96
00:07:06.568 --> 00:07:07.600
OK. fine.

97
00:07:07.635 --> 00:07:11.703
But what are the rules?

98
00:07:11.738 --> 00:07:12.539
Rules.

99
00:07:12.574 --> 00:07:12.935
Yeah.

100
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:18.545
Protect the body.

101
00:07:21.616 --> 00:07:21.977
Got it.

102
00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:30.249
I'll be back to help
in a couple of hours.

103
00:07:50.007 --> 00:07:51.138
It's you and me.

104
00:07:59.885 --> 00:08:01.247
Relax Fisher. it could be worse.

105
00:08:30.883 --> 00:08:34.588
Really. five minutes in
and we're doing this?

106
00:08:37.153 --> 00:08:40.352
OK Fisher. come on.

107
00:08:40.387 --> 00:08:44.862
Everything had a
feeling to it that day.

108
00:08:44.897 --> 00:08:47.062
Wrong feeling.

109
00:08:47.097 --> 00:08:55.301
That circle she was in. the
woods. the truck. that cabin.

110
00:08:55.336 --> 00:08:56.335
All of it.

111
00:08:58.878 --> 00:09:00.141
Wrong.

112
00:09:00.814 --> 00:09:01.681
How?

113
00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:06.345
It was alive.

114
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.820
Alive?

115
00:09:08.855 --> 00:09:10.217
Yeah.

116
00:09:10.252 --> 00:09:11.922
They put those flowers there.

117
00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:17.730
The red poppy?

118
00:09:17.765 --> 00:09:21.261
The one you mentioned
in the report?

119
00:09:21.296 --> 00:09:23.901
It was a puzzle piece.

120
00:09:23.936 --> 00:09:27.168
Lucy collected flowers.

121
00:09:27.203 --> 00:09:28.004
She had this list.

122
00:09:31.438 --> 00:09:35.374
And you believe
it was put there.

123
00:09:35.409 --> 00:09:37.750
It couldn't have
just been there?

124
00:09:52.426 --> 00:09:53.062
No way.

125
00:09:56.265 --> 00:09:59.101
Winters should have never left.

126
00:09:59.136 --> 00:10:02.236
Do you blame her?

127
00:10:02.271 --> 00:10:06.108
Everything changed after that.

128
00:10:06.143 --> 00:10:09.078
They wanted me to
go into that truck.

129
00:10:09.113 --> 00:10:12.444
They had something to show me.

130
00:10:12.479 --> 00:10:16.118
Who are we talking about James?

131
00:10:16.153 --> 00:10:16.723
Who are they?

132
00:10:20.289 --> 00:10:21.761
The keepers of the puzzle.

133
00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.832
The ones who control the game.

134
00:10:29.837 --> 00:10:32.772
Are we talking about
God and the devil?

135
00:10:37.306 --> 00:10:39.911
Sure.

136
00:10:39.946 --> 00:10:42.309
If that helps you understand.

137
00:10:53.454 --> 00:10:59.194
Were these keepers
controlling you?

138
00:11:14.882 --> 00:11:21.887
Ah. Oh. Oh. Jesus.

139
00:11:28.896 --> 00:11:29.730
Oh my God.

140
00:11:46.914 --> 00:11:47.880
Asshole bird.

141
00:11:58.893 --> 00:12:00.321
What did you eat?

142
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.393
Oh God. it's in my eye.

143
00:12:55.378 --> 00:12:58.115
Matia Ableman.

144
00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.414
Curator of Occult Antiquities.

145
00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:09.621
Antiquities.

146
00:13:09.656 --> 00:13:10.055
Really?

147
00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:10.996
That's a job?

148
00:13:21.041 --> 00:13:22.909
What is this?

149
00:13:26.277 --> 00:13:27.848
What in the world?

150
00:13:34.021 --> 00:13:34.987
Soul gathering.

151
00:13:57.209 --> 00:14:00.012
What?

152
00:14:00.047 --> 00:14:01.442
Oh. you're kidding me.

153
00:14:06.218 --> 00:14:09.516
What the hell were you
doing out here Mrs Ableman?

154
00:14:23.169 --> 00:14:25.499
Whoa.

155
00:14:25.534 --> 00:14:28.469
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

156
00:14:32.409 --> 00:14:32.913
Weird shit.

157
00:15:02.505 --> 00:15:03.240
Winters. that you?

158
00:15:03.275 --> 00:15:04.109
Over.

159
00:15:07.444 --> 00:15:10.115
Winters. what time did you say
they were going to get her?

160
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:10.582
Over.

161
00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:14.383
You there partner?

162
00:15:14.418 --> 00:15:17.683
Come back.

163
00:15:17.718 --> 00:15:19.223
Unit. report your call sign.

164
00:15:19.258 --> 00:15:22.094
Over.

165
00:15:22.129 --> 00:15:23.062
Call sign?

166
00:15:23.097 --> 00:15:24.393
Let's see. callsign.

167
00:15:24.428 --> 00:15:27.264
How about Tweedle Dee.

168
00:15:27.299 --> 00:15:28.232
Which would make you--

169
00:15:28.267 --> 00:15:29.266
Unit. please report.

170
00:15:29.301 --> 00:15:30.762
Over.

171
00:15:30.797 --> 00:15:31.429
Nope.

172
00:15:31.465 --> 00:15:33.303
That would be Tweedle Dumb.

173
00:15:33.338 --> 00:15:35.734
Sir. this is an
official channel.

174
00:15:35.769 --> 00:15:37.340
You need to desist immediately.

175
00:15:37.375 --> 00:15:38.143
Over.

176
00:15:41.115 --> 00:15:42.411
Desist.

177
00:15:42.446 --> 00:15:45.117
First rodeo then?

178
00:15:45.152 --> 00:15:48.450
Sir. this is a
restricted frequency.

179
00:15:48.485 --> 00:15:50.254
What you're doing
is against the law.

180
00:15:50.289 --> 00:15:52.223
Over.

181
00:15:52.258 --> 00:15:54.093
OK. OK cowboy.

182
00:15:54.128 --> 00:15:56.293
Just though you could use
a second pair of eyes.

183
00:15:56.328 --> 00:15:58.163
That's all.

184
00:15:58.198 --> 00:16:00.297
Help you see what
you're not seeing.

185
00:16:00.332 --> 00:16:03.531
Sir. you need to keep
this frequency clear.

186
00:16:03.566 --> 00:16:04.664
Over and out.

187
00:18:52.702 --> 00:18:55.967
This is important to
clarify for the jury.

188
00:18:56.002 --> 00:19:00.840
From that moment. when you
touched the deceased's hand.

189
00:19:00.875 --> 00:19:02.347
is that when they took control?

190
00:19:05.946 --> 00:19:06.516
Control.

191
00:19:11.721 --> 00:19:14.656
I would flash from one place to
another with no memory of how

192
00:19:14.691 --> 00:19:17.494
I got there.

193
00:19:17.529 --> 00:19:18.297
Things just happened.

194
00:19:21.995 --> 00:19:23.533
Why didn't you call for help?

195
00:19:25.834 --> 00:19:28.835
They wouldn't let me.

196
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:31.574
Did you talk to them?

197
00:19:31.609 --> 00:19:33.939
No.

198
00:19:33.974 --> 00:19:36.216
Then how did you know what
they wanted you to do?

199
00:19:39.045 --> 00:19:46.688
I could feel them inside.
worming around. poking at me.

200
00:19:50.925 --> 00:19:52.232
And you couldn't stop them?

201
00:19:54.566 --> 00:19:55.400
Clearly.

202
00:20:02.904 --> 00:20:06.873
James. is it your
belief that you are

203
00:20:06.908 --> 00:20:09.315
possessed by a demonic entity?

204
00:20:15.455 --> 00:20:18.423
Hey. you're the expert.

205
00:21:02.029 --> 00:21:03.028
Holy shit.

206
00:21:14.811 --> 00:21:15.612
Winter. come back.

207
00:21:15.647 --> 00:21:16.481
Over.

208
00:21:19.915 --> 00:21:20.683
Winters. come in.

209
00:21:20.718 --> 00:21:21.486
Over.

210
00:21:25.855 --> 00:21:27.459
Shit. where are you?

211
00:21:42.674 --> 00:21:45.906
Throw the ball daddy. Throw it.

212
00:21:55.654 --> 00:21:56.015
Lucy.

213
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:02.626
Lucy.

214
00:22:02.661 --> 00:22:03.022
Lucy.

215
00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:06.366
Lucy.

216
00:23:14.634 --> 00:23:15.061
Oh. shit.

217
00:26:05.035 --> 00:26:08.366
Did you want to hurt yourself?

218
00:26:08.401 --> 00:26:11.237
Every day.

219
00:26:11.272 --> 00:26:15.615
You blame yourself for
Lucy's death. the drowning?

220
00:26:19.379 --> 00:26:23.953
I think it's important that
we talk about Lucy and Mary.

221
00:26:26.892 --> 00:26:27.253
Why?

222
00:26:29.455 --> 00:26:34.293
Well James. to be
blunt. I'm wondering

223
00:26:34.328 --> 00:26:38.770
if their deaths are what
precipitated this leap into--

224
00:26:42.941 --> 00:26:45.271
Madness.

225
00:26:45.306 --> 00:26:48.912
I'd use the term disassociation.

226
00:26:48.947 --> 00:26:50.716
Oh. OK.

227
00:26:53.853 --> 00:26:59.120
Do you think these keepers.
these entities that you saw out

228
00:26:59.155 --> 00:27:03.157
there. could they just be a
manifestation of your guilt?

229
00:27:07.328 --> 00:27:08.327
What does the folder say?

230
00:27:17.305 --> 00:27:18.106
OK.

231
00:27:18.141 --> 00:27:19.910
All right.

232
00:27:19.945 --> 00:27:20.746
Right there.

233
00:27:28.954 --> 00:27:30.756
Stay right there Mrs Ableman.

234
00:27:45.168 --> 00:27:46.332
Protect the body.

235
00:27:49.535 --> 00:27:50.842
This is insane.

236
00:27:59.017 --> 00:28:02.183
OK. sure.

237
00:28:32.116 --> 00:28:33.016
Jesus Christ.

238
00:28:33.051 --> 00:28:36.019
Get it together Fisher.

239
00:28:36.054 --> 00:28:37.823
No.

240
00:28:37.858 --> 00:28:41.090
I saw you.

241
00:28:41.125 --> 00:28:41.893
You were moving.

242
00:30:21.489 --> 00:30:23.357
OK.

243
00:30:23.392 --> 00:30:24.589
You're shot.

244
00:30:24.624 --> 00:30:25.260
I'm shot.

245
00:30:30.498 --> 00:30:34.401
How about we just hang
in for a bit Mrs Ableman.

246
00:30:34.436 --> 00:30:35.336
What do you say?

247
00:30:46.316 --> 00:30:47.513
Hey. it's me.

248
00:30:47.548 --> 00:30:49.053
Before you come home
tonight. will you

249
00:30:49.088 --> 00:30:51.352
make sure to send that
check to Three Rivers?

250
00:30:51.387 --> 00:30:55.422
I just-- I really want to make
sure it gets there on time. OK?

251
00:30:55.457 --> 00:30:56.291
See you soon.

252
00:30:56.326 --> 00:30:56.896
I love you.

253
00:31:00.231 --> 00:31:12.208
So I told him one
thing at a time I suppose.

254
00:31:12.243 --> 00:31:15.340
I need to let him get his
head wrapped around it.

255
00:31:19.415 --> 00:31:21.921
Things haven't been
great since Lucy.

256
00:31:26.356 --> 00:31:28.224
Well. I know that.

257
00:31:28.259 --> 00:31:29.423
But try telling him.

258
00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:34.560
Trust me.

259
00:31:34.595 --> 00:31:36.232
It's not as easy as that.

260
00:31:36.267 --> 00:31:39.103
You can't snap your fingers
and make it go away.

261
00:31:43.736 --> 00:31:46.407
Yeah. he's out back. digging.

262
00:34:03.744 --> 00:34:05.183
What are you doing?

263
00:34:08.386 --> 00:34:10.089
Jesus. you scared me.

264
00:34:16.361 --> 00:34:17.129
Checking the time.

265
00:34:20.233 --> 00:34:23.861
In the decedents car?

266
00:34:23.896 --> 00:34:25.401
Yeah.

267
00:34:25.436 --> 00:34:27.865
Just use your phone.

268
00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:28.503
Right.

269
00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:36.181
Fisher?

270
00:34:36.216 --> 00:34:36.577
Uh huh?

271
00:34:40.484 --> 00:34:41.186
Where's the body?

272
00:34:47.425 --> 00:34:48.589
I moved it into the house.

273
00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:58.302
And is there a
reason you did that?

274
00:35:01.769 --> 00:35:03.274
Yes.

275
00:35:03.309 --> 00:35:05.276
Wait.

276
00:35:05.311 --> 00:35:06.211
Just.

277
00:35:06.246 --> 00:35:07.872
Look.

278
00:35:07.907 --> 00:35:10.578
Just.

279
00:35:10.613 --> 00:35:11.678
Wait. wait. wait. wait. look.

280
00:35:11.713 --> 00:35:15.286
Look. look. look.

281
00:35:15.321 --> 00:35:15.748
I found it.

282
00:35:19.523 --> 00:35:22.392
Uh huh.

283
00:35:22.427 --> 00:35:24.295
It was taped to this.

284
00:35:30.303 --> 00:35:30.664
OK.

285
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:35.933
I found it in one of her books.

286
00:35:40.676 --> 00:35:41.840
One of whose books?

287
00:35:47.584 --> 00:35:50.420
Mrs Ableman's.

288
00:35:50.455 --> 00:35:50.816
I see.

289
00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:58.560
Listen Nancy Drew.

290
00:35:58.595 --> 00:36:00.628
I came here to let you
know the family's running

291
00:36:00.663 --> 00:36:02.795
a little bit behind schedule.

292
00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:05.435
OK.

293
00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:07.767
But I'm having serious
second thoughts about having

294
00:36:07.802 --> 00:36:09.208
you stay up here alone.

295
00:36:12.037 --> 00:36:12.469
Why?

296
00:36:16.349 --> 00:36:17.645
Call it intuition.

297
00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:20.615
Winters. look.

298
00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:23.948
I know how horsey this looks
but I promise you. I'm fine.

299
00:36:23.983 --> 00:36:25.554
OK?

300
00:36:25.589 --> 00:36:27.655
I'm fine.

301
00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:29.822
All right.

302
00:36:29.857 --> 00:36:31.659
Why haven't you been
answering your radio?

303
00:36:35.401 --> 00:36:38.369
My radio hasn't gone on.

304
00:36:38.404 --> 00:36:42.032
I've been calling you every
15 minutes for the past hour.

305
00:36:42.067 --> 00:36:43.539
You could have
saved me this trip.

306
00:36:43.574 --> 00:36:44.540
I don't know.

307
00:36:44.575 --> 00:36:44.969
It's on.

308
00:36:48.513 --> 00:36:49.545
Just make sure it's on.

309
00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:50.645
Yeah. of course.

310
00:36:57.390 --> 00:36:57.722
Shit.

311
00:36:57.757 --> 00:36:58.752
I forgot.

312
00:36:58.787 --> 00:37:01.524
I got you something.

313
00:37:01.559 --> 00:37:04.560
Got me something?

314
00:37:04.595 --> 00:37:07.497
Uh huh.

315
00:37:07.532 --> 00:37:09.598
I know I'm a few weeks late.

316
00:37:09.633 --> 00:37:12.865
I'm shit with this stuff.

317
00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:14.273
Happy birthday anyway.

318
00:37:17.674 --> 00:37:18.409
Here. take them.

319
00:37:22.613 --> 00:37:25.779
It's opera.

320
00:37:25.814 --> 00:37:29.717
Experiences are
the latest thing.

321
00:37:29.752 --> 00:37:33.721
I could have bought you a
desk lamp but it would break.

322
00:37:33.756 --> 00:37:36.724
Experiences stick with you.

323
00:37:36.759 --> 00:37:37.923
So the logic goes.

324
00:37:42.732 --> 00:37:46.932
There's a-- there's two of them.

325
00:37:46.967 --> 00:37:48.703
You know. I think I
figured out how you

326
00:37:48.738 --> 00:37:52.773
graduated top of the academy.

327
00:37:52.808 --> 00:37:54.841
Call a friend.

328
00:37:54.876 --> 00:37:58.383
Heard the term?

329
00:37:58.418 --> 00:37:59.648
No. it's good.

330
00:37:59.683 --> 00:38:00.616
It's good.

331
00:38:00.651 --> 00:38:02.783
I can do that.

332
00:38:02.818 --> 00:38:07.458
Listen. if you can't find
someone to throw with. call me.

333
00:38:07.493 --> 00:38:11.792
I could use a night out.

334
00:38:11.827 --> 00:38:15.631
Would it be OK with Brad?

335
00:38:15.666 --> 00:38:16.665
Fuck Brad.

336
00:38:21.573 --> 00:38:22.341
OK.

337
00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:28.512
Thanks Amy.

338
00:38:28.547 --> 00:38:33.385
Seriously. you deserve
to have a life.

339
00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:35.354
You've put it on pause
for long enough. yeah?

340
00:38:43.661 --> 00:38:45.958
Hey boss?

341
00:38:45.993 --> 00:38:47.993
Where's your car?

342
00:38:48.028 --> 00:38:51.865
I left it down by the road.

343
00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:55.506
Needed to stretch my legs. soak
up the sunshine while it lasts.

344
00:39:17.222 --> 00:39:18.562
Found your ball.

345
00:39:31.742 --> 00:39:33.038
Keep that radio on.

346
00:39:40.014 --> 00:39:42.850
Throw the ball daddy.

347
00:39:42.885 --> 00:39:45.853
Throw it.

348
00:39:45.888 --> 00:39:47.690
Did I lose you?

349
00:39:47.725 --> 00:39:49.021
Come on.

350
00:39:49.056 --> 00:39:51.661
We gotta get these planted.

351
00:39:51.696 --> 00:39:53.157
For Lucy.

352
00:39:53.192 --> 00:39:53.762
Dig.

353
00:40:47.917 --> 00:40:49.114
Keep digging.

354
00:41:06.804 --> 00:41:10.135
Let's get back to your
family for a brief moment.

355
00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:12.643
The police report said
you saw both Lucy and Mary

356
00:41:12.678 --> 00:41:13.809
out there that day.

357
00:41:13.844 --> 00:41:15.239
Yes.

358
00:41:15.274 --> 00:41:18.748
But you know that's
not possible.

359
00:41:18.783 --> 00:41:20.684
Yes.

360
00:41:20.719 --> 00:41:23.720
Can you explain how those
two statements can coexist?

361
00:41:23.755 --> 00:41:26.954
They make you see what
they want you to see.

362
00:41:26.989 --> 00:41:29.990
Are they here now?

363
00:41:30.025 --> 00:41:32.157
Not anymore.

364
00:41:32.192 --> 00:41:35.699
But they were before?

365
00:41:35.734 --> 00:41:37.096
They come and they go.

366
00:41:40.706 --> 00:41:41.903
I see.

367
00:41:41.938 --> 00:41:43.575
No you don't.

368
00:41:49.682 --> 00:41:50.175
But you will.

369
00:41:52.817 --> 00:41:54.146
Just like you asked.

370
00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:53.804
Shit.

371
00:44:28.038 --> 00:44:29.136
Hey partner.

372
00:44:29.171 --> 00:44:30.808
You out there?

373
00:44:30.843 --> 00:44:32.711
I could really use
someone to talk to.

374
00:44:35.881 --> 00:44:38.310
Sir. I told you to keep
this frequency clear.

375
00:44:38.345 --> 00:44:41.115
Over.

376
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:42.116
OK. bud.

377
00:44:42.151 --> 00:44:43.282
Calm down.

378
00:44:43.317 --> 00:44:44.448
Look. if we're
going to be friends.

379
00:44:44.483 --> 00:44:45.988
can we skip the formalities?

380
00:44:46.023 --> 00:44:47.187
Maybe drop the overs?

381
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.897
Who are you?

382
00:44:58.838 --> 00:44:59.804
Nobody really.

383
00:44:59.839 --> 00:45:01.201
A friend I guess.

384
00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:07.042
you OK friend?

385
00:45:07.077 --> 00:45:08.175
You sound kind of rattled.

386
00:45:13.116 --> 00:45:14.852
It's nothing.

387
00:45:14.887 --> 00:45:17.184
It's just a--

388
00:45:17.219 --> 00:45:21.353
I thought I saw something.

389
00:45:21.388 --> 00:45:23.894
Bad dream I guess.

390
00:45:23.929 --> 00:45:27.359
Yeah. but I've
been seeing things.

391
00:45:27.394 --> 00:45:30.527
I can't keep track of time.

392
00:45:33.202 --> 00:45:36.368
Something's happening
out here to me.

393
00:45:36.403 --> 00:45:38.876
I'm not there right now.

394
00:45:38.911 --> 00:45:42.407
OK. so I wasn't telling
you the full truth earlier.

395
00:45:45.247 --> 00:45:46.785
I'm out here
watching over a body.

396
00:45:50.054 --> 00:45:53.088
Protecting it.

397
00:45:53.123 --> 00:45:54.419
No. it's different.

398
00:45:54.454 --> 00:45:58.588
It's like-- OK. look. I
know this sounds insane.

399
00:45:58.623 --> 00:46:06.596
but thoughts in my head.
feelings. memories.

400
00:46:06.631 --> 00:46:08.972
they're becoming--

401
00:46:09.007 --> 00:46:09.808
God. I don't know.

402
00:46:13.979 --> 00:46:14.912
Yeah. OK.

403
00:46:18.610 --> 00:46:20.379
Yeah. that's
probably a good idea.

404
00:46:33.493 --> 00:46:35.966
You told the police you
were speaking with a Park

405
00:46:36.001 --> 00:46:36.868
Ranger on the radio.

406
00:46:41.171 --> 00:46:42.599
Yes.

407
00:46:42.634 --> 00:46:45.173
Did they tell you there wasn't
a park Ranger within 100

408
00:46:45.208 --> 00:46:47.109
miles of where you were?

409
00:46:47.144 --> 00:46:50.277
They would have been out
of range of radio signal.

410
00:46:50.312 --> 00:46:53.181
Yeah. they did.

411
00:46:53.216 --> 00:46:56.118
And do you believe them?

412
00:46:56.153 --> 00:46:57.152
Sure.

413
00:46:57.187 --> 00:46:57.889
Why not?

414
00:47:03.028 --> 00:47:07.261
So if that's the case.
who were you talking to?

415
00:47:29.252 --> 00:47:30.119
You there partner?

416
00:47:30.154 --> 00:47:30.614
Come back.

417
00:48:03.088 --> 00:48:04.648
Hey partner. I made
it back to the cabin.

418
00:48:04.683 --> 00:48:05.253
Come back.

419
00:48:11.195 --> 00:48:15.428
I can't talk right now James.

420
00:48:15.463 --> 00:48:16.231
Yeah. copy that.

421
00:48:16.266 --> 00:48:16.693
Over and out.

422
00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:24.635
Hey Winters. you out there?

423
00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:25.075
Come back.

424
00:49:19.659 --> 00:49:20.592
OK. come Mrs Ableman.

425
00:49:20.627 --> 00:49:24.233
Come on. up you go.

426
00:49:24.268 --> 00:49:25.432
OK.

427
00:49:25.467 --> 00:49:26.763
I got you.

428
00:49:26.798 --> 00:49:28.006
There we go.

429
00:49:41.351 --> 00:49:42.350
Oh. hell no.

430
00:50:17.453 --> 00:50:18.320
Witness.

431
00:50:18.355 --> 00:50:18.749
Come back.

432
00:50:18.784 --> 00:50:21.191
Over.

433
00:50:21.226 --> 00:50:25.360
Winters. come the fuck
back right fucking now.

434
00:50:25.395 --> 00:50:25.789
Over.

435
00:50:29.366 --> 00:50:29.727
OK.

436
00:50:32.732 --> 00:50:34.204
Hi.

437
00:50:34.239 --> 00:50:36.536
Did I lose you?

438
00:50:36.571 --> 00:50:39.539
We gotta get these
planted. for Lucy.

439
00:51:12.277 --> 00:51:14.706
No family. huh?

440
00:51:14.741 --> 00:51:17.577
No.

441
00:51:17.612 --> 00:51:19.546
Don't you hate
waiting on people?

442
00:51:22.485 --> 00:51:26.421
Can we-- can we go now?

443
00:51:26.456 --> 00:51:27.125
Not yet.

444
00:51:28.788 --> 00:51:31.426
Any idea how much longer?

445
00:51:31.461 --> 00:51:31.855
Soon.

446
00:51:35.927 --> 00:51:43.504
Winters. something's been
happening to me up here.

447
00:51:43.539 --> 00:51:45.737
How do you mean?

448
00:51:45.772 --> 00:51:48.245
I don't know exactly.

449
00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:53.580
Everything's been twisty
since you left this morning.

450
00:51:58.488 --> 00:52:02.721
Well. I'm sure it's just--

451
00:52:02.756 --> 00:52:04.624
something in the air.

452
00:52:09.829 --> 00:52:13.633
That thing gives me the creeps.

453
00:52:13.668 --> 00:52:14.304
Shit detail.

454
00:52:17.342 --> 00:52:21.575
What do you say you help
me move it out of here?

455
00:52:21.610 --> 00:52:24.479
What?

456
00:52:24.514 --> 00:52:26.448
Come on.

457
00:52:26.483 --> 00:52:28.648
Don't make me do this by myself.

458
00:52:28.683 --> 00:52:31.321
We're supposed to
be protecting it.

459
00:52:31.356 --> 00:52:33.521
You've done a bang up
job of that so far.

460
00:52:33.556 --> 00:52:34.753
Whoa. but you said--

461
00:52:34.788 --> 00:52:37.492
I say a lot of things.

462
00:52:37.527 --> 00:52:40.363
Come on.

463
00:52:40.398 --> 00:52:41.958
No.

464
00:52:41.993 --> 00:52:43.960
Seriously.

465
00:52:43.995 --> 00:52:45.665
Come on.

466
00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:47.370
I said no.

467
00:52:55.413 --> 00:52:58.546
She'll probably just
come back anyway.

468
00:52:58.581 --> 00:53:01.351
Her?

469
00:53:01.386 --> 00:53:02.385
The dead body?

470
00:53:05.852 --> 00:53:06.290
Yep.

471
00:53:12.331 --> 00:53:13.759
What are you doing?

472
00:53:13.794 --> 00:53:14.991
Would you dance with me?

473
00:53:18.568 --> 00:53:20.931
What?

474
00:53:20.966 --> 00:53:22.438
Please?

475
00:53:22.473 --> 00:53:24.374
It's been such a long
time since I've danced.

476
00:53:28.512 --> 00:53:30.644
I can't.

477
00:53:30.679 --> 00:53:31.711
You owe it to yourself.

478
00:53:40.755 --> 00:53:43.426
That's an order Deputy Fisher.

479
00:53:47.399 --> 00:53:47.760
Come on.

480
00:53:51.370 --> 00:53:51.731
Trust me.

481
00:54:47.723 --> 00:54:50.625
Jesus. Fisher.

482
00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:53.463
Holy shit.

483
00:54:53.498 --> 00:54:53.863
Let's go.

484
00:54:53.899 --> 00:54:55.058
Follow him.

485
00:54:55.093 --> 00:54:55.927
I'll cut him off around back.

486
00:54:55.962 --> 00:54:56.664
No. no. no. no. no.

487
00:54:56.699 --> 00:54:57.632
It's a bad idea.

488
00:54:57.667 --> 00:54:58.666
We need to stick together.

489
00:54:58.701 --> 00:54:59.502
What the hell's wrong with you?

490
00:54:59.537 --> 00:54:59.766
Just do your job.

491
00:55:02.771 --> 00:55:03.341
Oh. shit.

492
00:55:13.683 --> 00:55:15.617
Winters.

493
00:55:15.652 --> 00:55:18.015
James. you there?

494
00:55:18.050 --> 00:55:20.116
You need to get off
the line right now.

495
00:55:20.151 --> 00:55:23.020
No James. you need
to listen to me.

496
00:55:23.055 --> 00:55:25.759
You need to get off
this line immediately.

497
00:55:25.794 --> 00:55:27.090
Winters.

498
00:55:27.125 --> 00:55:28.927
She's not who she says she is.

499
00:55:31.569 --> 00:55:33.096
Excuse me?

500
00:55:33.131 --> 00:55:37.969
Your boss. she's lying to you.

501
00:55:38.004 --> 00:55:39.135
She's been lying to you.

502
00:55:41.876 --> 00:55:43.810
About what?

503
00:55:43.845 --> 00:55:44.976
She seem right to you?

504
00:55:45.011 --> 00:55:49.552
Is she acting normal?

505
00:55:53.789 --> 00:55:57.527
James. stop.

506
00:55:57.562 --> 00:55:59.760
Winters.

507
00:55:59.795 --> 00:56:03.126
Stop right now.

508
00:56:03.161 --> 00:56:04.127
It's a trap.

509
00:56:08.606 --> 00:56:09.572
Holt shit.

510
00:56:12.907 --> 00:56:14.874
Hey. calm down.

511
00:56:14.909 --> 00:56:15.677
Winters. it's Fisher.

512
00:56:15.712 --> 00:56:16.645
It's me.

513
00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:18.713
It's Fisher.

514
00:56:18.748 --> 00:56:20.847
Calm down.

515
00:56:20.882 --> 00:56:22.684
What the fuck happened to you?

516
00:56:22.719 --> 00:56:23.718
What the fuck happened?

517
00:56:23.753 --> 00:56:25.951
You fucking happened you freak.

518
00:56:25.986 --> 00:56:26.721
Shh.

519
00:56:26.756 --> 00:56:27.689
Okay. okay.

520
00:56:29.561 --> 00:56:31.759
What the hell
are you talking about?

521
00:56:31.794 --> 00:56:33.497
Okay. I'm gonna get you out.

522
00:56:42.607 --> 00:56:43.705
Wait. wait...

523
00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:32.655
What happened to
Sheriff Winters?

524
00:57:35.319 --> 00:57:36.560
She died.

525
00:57:39.565 --> 00:57:43.699
The autopsy says
the cause of death

526
00:57:43.734 --> 00:57:48.506
was due to penetrating
injuries to the abdomen.

527
00:57:51.610 --> 00:57:52.268
Did you do it?

528
00:57:55.306 --> 00:57:57.845
I was the only one out there.

529
00:57:57.880 --> 00:57:59.308
Right?

530
00:57:59.343 --> 00:58:02.586
I mean. that's what
you keep telling me.

531
00:58:05.349 --> 00:58:08.185
Did you have a
relationship with her?

532
00:58:08.957 --> 00:58:10.121
Nope.

533
00:58:12.323 --> 00:58:15.830
Did you want to have a
relationship with her?

534
00:58:15.865 --> 00:58:18.327
Come on. Doc.

535
00:58:18.362 --> 00:58:20.197
You got to do better than that.

536
00:59:41.379 --> 00:59:43.621
Why don't you shoot her James?

537
00:59:48.452 --> 00:59:50.793
I was you put them
in your pocket.

538
00:59:59.133 --> 01:00:01.265
I saw you dance with her.

539
01:00:03.335 --> 01:00:05.742
You never danced with me.

540
01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:11.748
Do you love her?

541
01:00:11.783 --> 01:00:13.783
Is she prettier than me?

542
01:00:14.313 --> 01:00:15.653
Stop.

543
01:00:17.921 --> 01:00:18.986
Stop.

544
01:00:19.351 --> 01:00:22.660
Am I so easy to forget?

545
01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:25.157
I'm sorry.

546
01:02:04.093 --> 01:02:04.520
Daddy?

547
01:02:14.433 --> 01:02:15.905
Why did you let me go?

548
01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:22.406
Why didn't you save me?

549
01:02:26.082 --> 01:02:30.414
I can't breathe.

550
01:02:30.449 --> 01:02:33.054
I can't breathe daddy.

551
01:02:33.089 --> 01:02:33.450
Baby.

552
01:02:39.293 --> 01:02:40.589
It's so dark here.

553
01:02:40.624 --> 01:02:41.023
I can't see you.

554
01:02:41.058 --> 01:02:42.899
Where are you?

555
01:02:42.934 --> 01:02:44.593
Why are you hiding?

556
01:02:44.628 --> 01:02:45.803
Where are you?

557
01:02:49.303 --> 01:02:52.271
You're not Lucy.

558
01:02:52.306 --> 01:02:53.976
This isn't real.

559
01:02:56.376 --> 01:02:58.475
Mommy's here.

560
01:02:58.510 --> 01:02:59.916
She wants to talk to you.

561
01:03:07.926 --> 01:03:08.287
Where?

562
01:03:11.457 --> 01:03:14.392
She won't stop coughing.

563
01:03:14.427 --> 01:03:17.593
I want to .

564
01:03:17.628 --> 01:03:18.836
Go that way.

565
01:03:36.614 --> 01:03:37.184
Lucy.

566
01:04:07.711 --> 01:04:12.219
I know you will
fuck me for sure.

567
01:04:12.254 --> 01:04:16.190
I see the way you watch me.

568
01:04:16.225 --> 01:04:17.059
Fuck you.

569
01:04:19.723 --> 01:04:20.898
You're not real.

570
01:06:00.164 --> 01:06:00.591
Fisher.

571
01:06:50.148 --> 01:06:50.509
Daddy?

572
01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:59.518
Lucy?

573
01:06:59.553 --> 01:07:00.519
It's so dark here.

574
01:07:05.163 --> 01:07:06.162
Lucy. wait.

575
01:07:14.403 --> 01:07:15.204
Why aren't you helping?

576
01:07:27.548 --> 01:07:29.416
Why didn't you save me?

577
01:07:29.451 --> 01:07:31.517
Lucy?

578
01:07:31.552 --> 01:07:32.518
Where are you?

579
01:09:00.773 --> 01:09:02.641
They're still out there.

580
01:09:02.676 --> 01:09:04.313
I'm not sure that's
a good idea partner.

581
01:09:09.848 --> 01:09:10.286
Yeah.

582
01:09:15.018 --> 01:09:17.953
I'm not so sure about
anything anymore.

583
01:09:17.988 --> 01:09:20.824
You have to confront this James.

584
01:09:20.859 --> 01:09:22.760
Who is the Park Ranger
you were speaking to?

585
01:09:26.865 --> 01:09:29.833
OK. let me see your pencil.

586
01:09:29.868 --> 01:09:31.571
Why?

587
01:09:31.606 --> 01:09:33.672
Because I'm going to stab
you in the neck with it.

588
01:09:36.545 --> 01:09:39.645
It's not funny James.

589
01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:41.350
I'm just kidding.

590
01:09:41.385 --> 01:09:43.649
Come on. let me see it.

591
01:09:43.684 --> 01:09:45.618
I can't do that.

592
01:09:45.653 --> 01:09:49.952
Let me see it.

593
01:10:00.338 --> 01:10:01.337
Paper too please.

594
01:10:09.072 --> 01:10:10.280
Thank you.

595
01:10:30.599 --> 01:10:31.400
What is that?

596
01:10:36.407 --> 01:10:39.672
That's the answer
to your question.

597
01:10:39.707 --> 01:10:41.542
Who I was talking to.

598
01:10:41.577 --> 01:10:44.677
Hey. do you see what he's
holding behind his back?

599
01:10:47.781 --> 01:10:48.747
There's nothing there.

600
01:10:52.687 --> 01:10:54.852
Sure there is.

601
01:10:54.887 --> 01:10:58.625
But you've got to
use your imagination.

602
01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:00.792
Just because you
can't see the knife

603
01:11:00.827 --> 01:11:02.860
doesn't mean it's not there.

604
01:12:08.158 --> 01:12:08.761
James.

605
01:12:11.733 --> 01:12:14.129
Hello?

606
01:12:14.164 --> 01:12:16.670
Jimmy.

607
01:12:16.705 --> 01:12:18.606
Hi.

608
01:12:18.641 --> 01:12:19.541
Did I lose you?

609
01:12:19.576 --> 01:12:21.136
Fucking finish it already.

610
01:12:56.877 --> 01:13:01.715
OK. OK. OK.

611
01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:02.683
OK Fisher.

612
01:13:02.718 --> 01:13:03.552
They're fucking with you.

613
01:13:03.587 --> 01:13:04.916
That's what they do.

614
01:13:10.726 --> 01:13:13.056
OK.

615
01:13:13.091 --> 01:13:14.563
Hey Winters. come back.

616
01:13:16.765 --> 01:13:17.665
Winters. it's Fisher.

617
01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:18.567
Come back.

618
01:13:29.074 --> 01:13:31.844
Why did you let me go?

619
01:13:31.879 --> 01:13:32.845
Why didn't you save me?

620
01:14:09.147 --> 01:14:10.245
Sheriff's Department.

621
01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:10.883
Open up.

622
01:14:14.823 --> 01:14:15.624
I know you're in there.

623
01:14:20.730 --> 01:14:21.289
Winters.

624
01:14:21.324 --> 01:14:21.689
Winters.

625
01:14:21.725 --> 01:14:22.664
No. no. no.

626
01:14:22.699 --> 01:14:23.258
It's me.

627
01:14:23.293 --> 01:14:23.962
Open your eyes.

628
01:14:23.997 --> 01:14:24.666
Look at me.

629
01:14:24.701 --> 01:14:25.832
Back off.

630
01:14:25.867 --> 01:14:26.668
No. no. no. they're
doing something.

631
01:14:26.703 --> 01:14:27.262
Back the fuck up.

632
01:14:27.297 --> 01:14:28.296
Listen to me.

633
01:14:28.331 --> 01:14:29.000
Put your hands behind your head.

634
01:14:29.035 --> 01:14:29.770
Look at me.

635
01:14:29.805 --> 01:14:30.133
Look at me.

636
01:14:30.168 --> 01:14:30.804
OK?

637
01:14:30.839 --> 01:14:32.069
Back up.

638
01:14:32.104 --> 01:14:32.773
They're doing something
something to you.

639
01:14:32.808 --> 01:14:33.807
I promise.

640
01:14:33.842 --> 01:14:34.203
Put your hands behind your head.

641
01:14:34.238 --> 01:14:35.578
OK.

642
01:14:35.613 --> 01:14:36.612
Winters. it's me.

643
01:14:36.647 --> 01:14:37.107
It's Fisher.

644
01:14:37.142 --> 01:14:38.779
OK?

645
01:14:38.814 --> 01:14:40.143
Sit.

646
01:14:40.178 --> 01:14:41.078
Amy.

647
01:14:41.113 --> 01:14:41.782
What did you call me?

648
01:14:41.817 --> 01:14:42.981
Sheriff.

649
01:14:43.016 --> 01:14:43.916
I'm telling you.

650
01:14:43.951 --> 01:14:45.148
They're doing something.

651
01:14:45.183 --> 01:14:48.217
You've got to-- you
have to listen. OK?

652
01:14:48.252 --> 01:14:49.592
Sit.

653
01:14:49.627 --> 01:14:49.922
Now.

654
01:14:49.957 --> 01:14:50.923
Hold on.

655
01:14:50.958 --> 01:14:51.825
I'm going.

656
01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:52.694
I'm going.

657
01:14:52.729 --> 01:14:54.223
Please. please. please.

658
01:14:54.258 --> 01:14:55.631
OK?

659
01:14:55.666 --> 01:14:57.963
I want you to put
the gun away. OK?

660
01:14:57.998 --> 01:14:59.635
Jesus Christ Amy.

661
01:14:59.670 --> 01:15:02.000
Take your fucking
finger off the trigger.

662
01:15:02.035 --> 01:15:02.836
Put that on.

663
01:15:02.871 --> 01:15:03.837
What?

664
01:15:03.872 --> 01:15:05.773
Now.

665
01:15:05.808 --> 01:15:07.302
OK.

666
01:15:07.337 --> 01:15:09.271
Hold on.

667
01:15:09.306 --> 01:15:09.876
Hold on.

668
01:15:12.848 --> 01:15:13.847
Amy.

669
01:15:13.882 --> 01:15:15.178
Why do you keep calling me that?

670
01:15:15.213 --> 01:15:19.149
Put the fucking gun away.

671
01:15:19.184 --> 01:15:20.689
What have you been
doing in here?

672
01:15:23.727 --> 01:15:24.319
Jesus Christ.

673
01:15:46.948 --> 01:15:49.817
All right.

674
01:15:49.852 --> 01:15:50.587
Start talking.

675
01:15:53.086 --> 01:15:54.184
Start talking about what?

676
01:15:57.255 --> 01:15:59.156
You're bad at this game.

677
01:16:02.227 --> 01:16:06.328
Was I not clear about the rules?

678
01:16:06.363 --> 01:16:12.037
Tell me. what happened with
our little friend over here?

679
01:16:20.179 --> 01:16:22.080
I don't know.

680
01:16:22.115 --> 01:16:23.279
Oh. come on.

681
01:16:27.252 --> 01:16:29.692
You can do better than
that you old snoop you.

682
01:16:34.094 --> 01:16:36.358
You did something.

683
01:16:40.298 --> 01:16:41.968
You finished what
she had started.

684
01:16:47.239 --> 01:16:49.107
I gave you one rule.

685
01:16:52.244 --> 01:16:55.443
Do you remember
what that rule was?

686
01:16:55.478 --> 01:16:57.951
Yeah.

687
01:16:57.986 --> 01:16:58.985
I remember the rule.

688
01:17:01.957 --> 01:17:02.318
Say it.

689
01:17:06.995 --> 01:17:07.829
Say it.

690
01:17:13.496 --> 01:17:16.200
Protect the body.

691
01:17:16.235 --> 01:17:17.135
And have you?

692
01:17:20.338 --> 01:17:22.107
She's still there isn't she?

693
01:17:37.322 --> 01:17:40.461
Everything has to be
just your way doesn't it?

694
01:17:44.329 --> 01:17:47.836
Everything in neat little rows.

695
01:17:52.370 --> 01:17:55.811
Did you exert your
authority over her. pervert?

696
01:18:09.387 --> 01:18:10.727
You want to know what I heard?

697
01:18:15.327 --> 01:18:17.228
I hear he killed his family.

698
01:18:22.367 --> 01:18:26.534
The whole lot of them.

699
01:18:26.569 --> 01:18:29.405
That's not true.

700
01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:30.879
Why would I lie about that?

701
01:18:34.049 --> 01:18:37.149
We have a 10-96 in progress
at Midland Heights.

702
01:18:37.184 --> 01:18:38.513
Over.

703
01:18:38.548 --> 01:18:40.449
This is Mobile Unit 1 dispatch.

704
01:18:40.484 --> 01:18:43.892
Copy that.

705
01:18:43.927 --> 01:18:44.926
Look at that.

706
01:18:51.264 --> 01:18:52.802
Saved by the bell.

707
01:19:10.415 --> 01:19:12.283
Guess we need to wrap this up.

708
01:19:14.958 --> 01:19:16.122
What are you doing?

709
01:19:16.157 --> 01:19:17.189
What are you doing.

710
01:19:17.224 --> 01:19:17.585
Stop.

711
01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:20.192
Stop.

712
01:19:20.227 --> 01:19:21.259
I know what you're doing.

713
01:19:24.330 --> 01:19:25.527
I know what you want me to do.

714
01:19:30.237 --> 01:19:30.939
Go ahead.

715
01:19:34.109 --> 01:19:36.571
Take her.

716
01:19:36.606 --> 01:19:39.244
Do you hear me?

717
01:19:39.279 --> 01:19:39.816
You can have her.

718
01:19:43.613 --> 01:19:44.282
I don't care.

719
01:19:48.222 --> 01:19:48.990
Take her.

720
01:20:00.201 --> 01:20:00.903
Oh. sweetie.

721
01:20:04.007 --> 01:20:04.874
They already did.

722
01:20:20.023 --> 01:20:20.956
Tell me who you are.

723
01:20:25.358 --> 01:20:26.192
An admirer.

724
01:20:30.330 --> 01:20:30.999
A coveter.

725
01:20:35.467 --> 01:20:37.038
I don't understand.

726
01:20:42.474 --> 01:20:44.045
You finished what I started.

727
01:20:47.083 --> 01:20:49.545
I've wanted nothing
more than to gaze

728
01:20:49.580 --> 01:20:55.551
upon them. to bask in their
all consuming darkness.

729
01:20:58.391 --> 01:20:59.962
It's been my life's work.

730
01:21:03.396 --> 01:21:07.629
But your aura. it's so shadow.

731
01:21:11.041 --> 01:21:13.305
The deepest black
I've ever seen.

732
01:21:21.117 --> 01:21:29.057
All this work. a lifetime.
they still want you.

733
01:21:36.396 --> 01:21:39.694
This is your fault.

734
01:21:39.729 --> 01:21:43.170
That would be easy. wouldn't it?

735
01:21:43.205 --> 01:21:45.271
So clean.

736
01:21:45.306 --> 01:21:45.942
But no.

737
01:21:59.353 --> 01:22:00.550
Keep digging.

738
01:22:17.503 --> 01:22:18.975
What time is it?

739
01:22:29.581 --> 01:22:31.119
Did I fall asleep?

740
01:22:38.359 --> 01:22:40.458
What were we talking about?

741
01:22:45.366 --> 01:22:46.398
I remember.

742
01:22:58.478 --> 01:23:00.148
Out baby's name.

743
01:23:04.748 --> 01:23:07.452
I always liked the name Lucy.

744
01:23:18.168 --> 01:23:19.200
It won't be long now.

745
01:23:21.666 --> 01:23:23.501
Just the three of us.

746
01:24:05.248 --> 01:24:06.148
What's the matter James?

747
01:24:10.418 --> 01:24:11.252
Aren't you happy?

748
01:24:20.263 --> 01:24:21.196
Don't be afraid.

749
01:24:55.529 --> 01:24:56.726
Keep digging.

750
01:26:09.702 --> 01:26:11.273
Hey there partner.

751
01:26:13.035 --> 01:26:15.343
When's the last time you ate?

752
01:26:15.642 --> 01:26:18.379
You look horrible.

753
01:26:18.414 --> 01:26:20.480
You've got to keep
your strength up James.

754
01:26:20.515 --> 01:26:22.812
There's work to be done.

755
01:26:23.518 --> 01:26:25.320
Not hungry.

756
01:26:33.660 --> 01:26:36.892
I didn't do those things.

757
01:26:37.367 --> 01:26:38.960
I didn't kill them.

758
01:26:42.064 --> 01:26:46.000
Like you want me
to believe I did.

759
01:26:46.035 --> 01:26:49.036
You've got to watch
Lucy a little closer.

760
01:26:49.071 --> 01:26:52.039
Mary thought you were
watching her didn't she?

761
01:26:52.074 --> 01:26:55.515
You said you were
always watching.

762
01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:59.684
I hear her screaming out
for you all the time.

763
01:26:59.719 --> 01:27:01.983
Begging for you to make it stop.

764
01:27:02.018 --> 01:27:04.425
Can you do that for her James?

765
01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:05.921
Can you make it stop?

766
01:27:08.860 --> 01:27:13.027
I never asked for any of this.

767
01:27:13.062 --> 01:27:16.569
You have to confront this James.

768
01:27:16.604 --> 01:27:18.769
No.

769
01:27:18.804 --> 01:27:20.276
I was following orders.

770
01:27:23.105 --> 01:27:25.578
Protect the body.

771
01:27:25.613 --> 01:27:26.909
What happened to
Sheriff Winters?

772
01:27:29.815 --> 01:27:30.913
I broke the rule.

773
01:27:30.948 --> 01:27:32.717
When you touched
the deceased hand.

774
01:27:32.752 --> 01:27:36.919
is that when they took control?

775
01:27:36.954 --> 01:27:40.054
So I never had control.

776
01:27:40.089 --> 01:27:41.858
Then even.

777
01:27:41.893 --> 01:27:43.365
Tell me. did you love her?

778
01:27:45.930 --> 01:27:48.766
Do you think she knew it?

779
01:27:48.801 --> 01:27:52.374
Did you tell her
enough while you could?

780
01:27:52.409 --> 01:27:54.937
I'm not so sure.

781
01:27:54.972 --> 01:27:56.906
She's here with me you know?

782
01:27:56.941 --> 01:27:59.744
Here in the dark.

783
01:27:59.779 --> 01:28:02.615
Lucy too.

784
01:28:02.650 --> 01:28:05.750
You want to know a secret?

785
01:28:05.785 --> 01:28:10.590
She actually thinks
you can save her.

786
01:28:10.625 --> 01:28:13.560
Break time's almost over.

787
01:28:13.595 --> 01:28:14.792
Eat up.

788
01:28:14.827 --> 01:28:17.729
then let's get back to it. huh?

789
01:29:04.679 --> 01:29:06.041
Good bye James.

790
01:29:36.843 --> 01:29:37.413
James.

791
01:31:04.997 --> 01:31:07.129
This is it my friend.

792
01:31:07.164 --> 01:31:10.264
This is where we part ways.

793
01:31:10.299 --> 01:31:12.266
Don't worry.

794
01:31:12.301 --> 01:31:15.071
There's nothing left to say.

795
01:31:15.106 --> 01:31:16.644
But I hear you anyway.

796
01:31:16.679 --> 01:31:18.272
I've always heard you.

797
01:31:41.836 --> 01:31:43.836
Yeah.

798
01:31:43.871 --> 01:31:45.541
Yes. you--

799
01:31:48.205 --> 01:31:50.139
Can
we meet in the dark?

800
01:31:50.174 --> 01:31:54.242
We don't have to say much.

801
01:31:54.277 --> 01:31:58.015
If you have to go. have to go.

802
01:32:02.318 --> 01:32:04.692
If we didn't know what we know.

803
01:32:10.733 --> 01:32:15.164
It's the end of the world
at the palm of my hand.

804
01:32:19.401 --> 01:32:23.007
When it all goes to Hell
will you still be my friend?

805
01:32:28.784 --> 01:32:32.214
My my face to the sea.
my back's to the land.

806
01:32:36.792 --> 01:32:41.157
If you can't come with
me. I'll understand.

807
01:32:45.130 --> 01:32:47.064
Can we Meet in the dark?

808
01:32:47.099 --> 01:32:49.099
We don't have to say much.

809
01:32:53.677 --> 01:32:55.710
And if you have
to go. have to go.

810
01:33:02.246 --> 01:33:04.620
I'll let you go. let you go.

811
01:33:08.054 --> 01:33:10.021
I'll let you go. let you go.

812
01:33:12.993 --> 01:33:15.631
If we didn't know what we know.

813
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:27.676
Cause when you travel light.
some things are left behind.

814
01:33:36.852 --> 01:33:39.050
It's the end of the world
at the palm of my hand.

815
01:33:44.992 --> 01:33:50.127
When it all goes to Hell
will you still be my friend?

816
01:33:55.167 --> 01:33:58.399
My face to the sea.
my back to the land.

817
01:34:03.340 --> 01:34:06.847
If you can't come with
me I'll understand.

818
01:34:14.450 --> 01:34:17.957
Well. this is it for us James.

819
01:34:17.992 --> 01:34:19.453
Did you get what you needed?

820
01:34:19.488 --> 01:34:22.126
Enough.

821
01:34:22.161 --> 01:34:23.259
I truly wish you the best.

822
01:34:26.968 --> 01:34:28.264
That's so kind of you.

823
01:34:57.031 --> 01:34:58.195
Did you drop something?

824
01:35:04.434 --> 01:35:07.743
Mr Fisher. I need that back.
