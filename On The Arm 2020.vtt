00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.800
- The Valley. as it is today.

7
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.200
Look at it. the air still
stinks of corruption.

8
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.940
The aftermath of nearly
seven decades of greed.

9
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.520
The capitalists controlled
every aspect of this steel town.

10
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.770
Laying waste to anything good in its path.

11
00:01:20.295 --> 00:01:21.904
(dog barking)

12
00:01:21.904 --> 00:01:26.160
I was born into it. product
of my environment they say.

13
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.020
I knew better. but it
still swallowed me whole.

14
00:01:37.364 --> 00:01:39.880
My family was big in
these parts back then.

15
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.380
Especially where yours is from.

16
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.870
This is what built and
destroyed this town.

17
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.080
Time changes everything.

18
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.400
In order to move forward.
you gotta go back.

19
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.050
See all those mountains that you climbed.

20
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.500
only then can you truly
appreciate the destination.

21
00:03:05.038 --> 00:03:06.020
- [Charlie] Your mom's
not gonna be too happy

22
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.870
when she finds out. you know.

23
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.560
- He started it. he
stole my baseball glove.

24
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.540
- Son. violence is the last resort.

25
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.400
You gotta learn to keep your cool

26
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.970
till it's time not too.

27
00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.200
- [Man In Suit] Shut up. shut up!

28
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.160
Your mother's talking to you. shut up!

29
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.993
- [Lady] It wasn't his fault.

30
00:03:20.993 --> 00:03:22.830
- [Man In Suit] What the hell
is the matter with you. huh?

31
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:23.779
- [Lady] It wasn't his fault.

32
00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:25.880
- Shut up!
- He called you a coward

33
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.880
for trying to leave the family.

34
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.380
- [Charlie] Don't you fight my
battles for me. you hear me?

35
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.213
- Yes sir.

36
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.920
- Besides. it was coming
from his drunk of a father.

37
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.108
- Shut up

38
00:03:36.108 --> 00:03:36.941
- It wasn't his fault.

39
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:37.940
- [Dad] What you wanna. you wanna mess

40
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:38.773
with your old man now?

41
00:03:38.773 --> 00:03:39.760
Is that the best you got?

42
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.694
- [Lady] No. don't Billy.

43
00:03:40.694 --> 00:03:41.707
(man grunting)
(body thudding)

44
00:03:41.707 --> 00:03:42.540
- You stay here. you hear me.

45
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.500
- Stop. stop.
- Huh?

46
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.791
- [Man] I said shut up. I'm sick of this!

47
00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:46.727
(skin smacking)
(lady groaning)

48
00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:48.625
(lady whimpering)

49
00:03:48.625 --> 00:03:52.090
Well. isn't it the yellow
belly Enzo to the rescue.

50
00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.395
(skin smacking)

51
00:03:56.395 --> 00:03:57.794
(body thudding)

52
00:03:57.794 --> 00:04:00.160
(man laughing)

53
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.190
- Jimbo's not gonna like you
messing around in our affairs.

54
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.860
- You two get in the
car. I'll take you home

55
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:05.810
after he sobers up.

56
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.280
- Hey. Tommy Gun Soreno.
I'm talking to you.

57
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.330
- [Charlie] I'll tell you what Michael.

58
00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.760
I'm gonna give your dumb
Cleveland ass a pass on this one

59
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.940
because you can't help yourself.

60
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.988
But if I hear about any more
bruises on Jeff over there.

61
00:04:24.988 --> 00:04:27.620
or if I hear about any more on your wife.

62
00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.050
your gonna need more than Jimbo's help.

63
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.330
'Cause I'm gonna break every
fucking bone in your body.

64
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.670
one by fucking one!

65
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.210
- Yeah. well all your ghost
stories don't scare me.

66
00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:49.820
- Sorry that had to happen to your boy

67
00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:50.970
and you too Mrs. Torin.

68
00:04:52.358 --> 00:04:54.470
- (sobbing) He's getting worse.

69
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:55.950
- You two can stay with us on the farm

70
00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.536
as long as you'd like.

71
00:04:57.536 --> 00:04:59.210
- Thank you Charlie.

72
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.450
- You're welcome ma'am.

73
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.760
Son. apologize to Jeff.

74
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.593
- But--

75
00:05:05.593 --> 00:05:06.910
- No buts.

76
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.980
- Fine. I'm sorry Jeffery.

77
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.560
- I'm sorry too Lou.
for stealing your glove

78
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.710
and you too Mr. Soreno.

79
00:05:14.943 --> 00:05:15.776
- That's okay.

80
00:05:16.654 --> 00:05:18.600
You see. friends again.

81
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.540
(dramatic music)

82
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.240
- You're gonna get yours
Tommy Soreno. soon.

83
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.560
(explosion booming)

84
00:06:03.275 --> 00:06:05.942
(phone ringing)

85
00:06:13.686 --> 00:06:14.519
- Hello?

86
00:06:16.239 --> 00:06:18.080
Yeah. hold on a second.

87
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.190
Honey. it's Jimmy.

88
00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:24.443
Hold on.

89
00:06:32.228 --> 00:06:33.211
When are you gonna quit smoking

90
00:06:33.211 --> 00:06:35.290
those disgusting things?

91
00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.450
- Maybe when you start putting out again.

92
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.873
Yeah. Jim.

93
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:13.063
He did what?

94
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.210
You tell him to meet me
out at the rock mine.

95
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:25.960
Have Tim and Johnny pick me up.

96
00:07:27.707 --> 00:07:30.374
(phone dinging)

97
00:07:37.344 --> 00:07:40.177
(thunder booming)

98
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:43.920
- [Reporter] Breaking news.

99
00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.220
terror strikes at the heart of yet

100
00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:47.640
another Youngstown family.
- Oh shit. (laughs)

101
00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.570
- [Reporter] Bringing the total

102
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.710
to 23 victims this past year.

103
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:52.470
For the second time this week.

104
00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.820
this has been showed by a car bomb.

105
00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.260
This time taking the lives of two.

106
00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.900
a father and son. and severely
injuring his second boy.

107
00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.510
Police are scouring the
streets to find the suspect.

108
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:07.290
But little hope is given
to find the mad bomber.

109
00:08:08.293 --> 00:08:10.084
- These freaking lops. (laughs)

110
00:08:10.084 --> 00:08:12.834
(engine roaring)

111
00:08:22.804 --> 00:08:25.740
(laughs) Boom. did you see that?

112
00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.060
Of course you did. everyone did.

113
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.510
They left a crater. (laughs)

114
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.230
Man. I wish I could've found that Tommy.

115
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:33.063
but oh well.

116
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.250
Mr. Mancini. you have to be pleased.

117
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:40.690
- Pleased. yeah pleased.

118
00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.020
Well I am not fucking pleased!

119
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:50.800
I said just Charlie. huh. what did you to?

120
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.159
What did you do?

121
00:08:52.159 --> 00:08:54.159
Blow up his two kids while you're at it.

122
00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.073
Get him up.

123
00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:06.028
Sick fuck!
(man groaning)

124
00:09:06.028 --> 00:09:08.760
- But Mr. Mancini. I did what you asked.

125
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.240
- [Mr. Mancini] I did
not ask for this okay.

126
00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.770
you know the fucking rules.

127
00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:13.930
- But you owe me.

128
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.790
- I owe you. (chuckles) owe you.

129
00:09:19.875 --> 00:09:22.175
Hey. who the fuck's this
guy think he is. huh?

130
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.190
You know who I fucking owe now?

131
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:28.150
Charlie's family. for life.

132
00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.060
I not only took out that woman's husband.

133
00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.210
but her eldest son too.

134
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.080
God only knows if the
youngest one will survive.

135
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.280
That's who I fucking
owe. you piece of shit.

136
00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.670
- [Killer] Mr. Mancini.

137
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:49.710
- Jim. get rid of pyromaniac child killer.

138
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.780
I got no more use for him.

139
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.730
You send him to hell. burn
him. where he belongs.

140
00:09:58.660 --> 00:09:59.510
- [Jim] Yes boss.

141
00:10:04.718 --> 00:10:07.218
(gun banging)

142
00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:09.603
- Funny thing.

143
00:10:09.603 --> 00:10:10.591
- [Mobster] Jim. get me
the gas can and the flares.

144
00:10:10.591 --> 00:10:12.370
- After that night. someone pulled my mom

145
00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:13.620
into a side room as the hospital

146
00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:14.914
and told her that all my medical bills

147
00:10:14.914 --> 00:10:17.120
had been paid for by an anonymous donor.

148
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.810
By the time we got home.
the garage was fixed.

149
00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:22.890
along with the side of the house.

150
00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:26.556
Plus. a few weeks later.
she received a contribution

151
00:10:26.556 --> 00:10:29.170
from the neighborhood. just
to get us back on our feet.

152
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.320
Never did find out who
was behind all that.

153
00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.450
but it was a nice homecoming.

154
00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:37.900
taking into consideration
what we'd been through.

155
00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:40.400
By the time I was healthy.

156
00:10:42.003 --> 00:10:43.820
good old Vito took me under his wing.

157
00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:49.047
So it began my journey into the abyss.

158
00:10:49.047 --> 00:10:54.047

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.280
- [Louis] Time changes everything.

193
00:14:58.140 --> 00:14:59.840
As fate would have it. I wound up

194
00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.290
back under the steel curtain.

195
00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.510
- You shoulda seen that guy.

196
00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:06.600
all dressed in his new
JCPenney catalog suit.

197
00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.430
- Louis] There's my pal. Jeffery Torin.

198
00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:11.070
- He laid down all his money
on the table and guess what?

199
00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:12.380
- [Both] Flop!

200
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.050
- [Louis] Ah Jeff. my
fest friend and partner.

201
00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.420
After my father and brother were killed.

202
00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:20.110
his mom and brothers
used to stop by the house

203
00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:22.389
and bring us dinner now and then.

204
00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:24.370
And my mom really appreciated that.

205
00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:25.790
His dad. of course. never came around.

206
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:27.190
which wasn't too big a loss.

207
00:15:28.164 --> 00:15:30.700
And we used to play in
the backyard for hours.

208
00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.320
Running around and
getting into adventures.

209
00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.300
Jeff really helped me get through

210
00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:35.630
some tough times in my life

211
00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:37.730
and he's been there for me more than once.

212
00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:39.980
- The dice were fucking loaded.

213
00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.960
- [Louis] Of course they were.

214
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.020
I bet that made Mancini happy.

215
00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:45.420
- It did. tell the scumbag tried to grab

216
00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.280
all his lost money and
get the fuck outta there.

217
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.844
- Aw.

218
00:15:48.844 --> 00:15:49.950
- You do that back in
the day at Jungle Inn.

219
00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:51.809
they'll be feeding you to fucking Wilbur.

220
00:15:51.809 --> 00:15:54.226
(man laughs)

221
00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:04.296
- Bet that new Penney suit'll
need some dry cleaning.

222
00:16:04.296 --> 00:16:06.782
- That and he won't be
able to play the clarinet

223
00:16:06.782 --> 00:16:10.030
very well for a while. (chuckles)

224
00:16:13.253 --> 00:16:17.000
- You see. in this town.
didn't matter who you were.

225
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.880
You obey capo law to the letter or else.

226
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:23.833
- [Jeffery] Oh.

227
00:16:23.833 --> 00:16:26.170
- Whoa. hey Jeff. Lou.

228
00:16:27.131 --> 00:16:28.762
You guys scared me.

229
00:16:28.762 --> 00:16:30.280
What can I do for you fellas?

230
00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.820
- [Jeff] Mancini wants to see you.

231
00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:33.893
Come on.

232
00:16:42.207 --> 00:16:43.830
- It wasn't unusual for
us to entertain people

233
00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:44.930
who opposed capo law.

234
00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.400
But tonight. it felt a little different.

235
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.879
You caught on quick to
keep your mouth shut

236
00:16:50.879 --> 00:16:52.740
or you wound up with lead poisoning.

237
00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:58.590
- So Mr. Mancini. what can I do you for?

238
00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:01.250
- I think we're having some
trouble with our communication.

239
00:17:02.753 --> 00:17:05.540
- What. what. what do you mean?

240
00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.250
- You took it upon yourself
to violate our agreements.

241
00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:10.250
- [Bill] Agreements. no.

242
00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:11.083
- No. sir.

243
00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:13.840
- [Bill] Yes. sorry.

244
00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:17.560
Sorry. no sir.

245
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:23.530
- Well then why did you try

246
00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:25.620
and shoot the fleeing DeFrange here?

247
00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.240
When he pulled that botched

248
00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.890
jewelry store robbery a week ago.

249
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.850
- You said because of that thing.

250
00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:37.840
The Chicago thing.

251
00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:39.683
- Chicago?

252
00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.120
Did something happen in Chicago?

253
00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:49.670
I pay you to protect my interests.

254
00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.200
When I give a man a job.

255
00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.150
that means I'm instilling in
them a certain level of trust.

256
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
So am I trusting the wrong person. Bill?

257
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:02.111
- No.

258
00:18:02.111 --> 00:18:03.620
- Because I thought you could
handle a simple little job

259
00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:04.850
to protect my interests.

260
00:18:06.037 --> 00:18:07.820
If I can't trust you to protect it.

261
00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.790
how can you trust me to protect you?

262
00:18:13.401 --> 00:18:16.710
- Yes. yes I understand.
I understand completely.

263
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:18.130
You can trust me. please
give me another chance.

264
00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:18.963
Mr. Mancini.
- Yeah I know. Bill.

265
00:18:18.963 --> 00:18:20.690
I know. Bill. people make mistakes.

266
00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:26.040
The secret is to learn from them

267
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.840
so we don't repeat those mistakes.

268
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:31.690
Yeah. I'll give you a second chance.

269
00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:36.340
But you will have to apologize.

270
00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:39.340
- Yes. I'm sorry. I'm
very sorry Mr. Mancini.

271
00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:40.810
It will never happen again.

272
00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:44.730
- There we go. all settled.

273
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:48.880
You just go on back to business as usual.

274
00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:50.860
Don't worry about Mr. DeFrange here.

275
00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.670
Oh cheer up. Johnny boy.

276
00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:57.970
He said he was sorry.

277
00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:01.360
Take him back to work boys.

278
00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:02.410
- [Mobster] Let's go.

279
00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:04.960
- [Mr. Mancini] You too. Johnny.

280
00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.010
I'm through with you.

281
00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:08.910
Oh hey. Louie.

282
00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:09.743
- [Louie] Yeah. boss.

283
00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:15.130
- Could you give this to your
mom when you get a chance?

284
00:19:15.996 --> 00:19:16.829
- Yeah.

285
00:19:17.691 --> 00:19:20.050
- I didn't want to forget her anniversary.

286
00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:23.450
That's a little something
special from Dianne and I.

287
00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:24.810
- [Louis] Thank you Mr. Mancini.

288
00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:27.740
(upbeat jazzy music)

289
00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:29.390
- Now get the fuck outta here. huh.

290
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:32.350
Wait over there for us.

291
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:38.240
- Mancini always had this
clever charm about him.

292
00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:43.240
That brought out the best
and the worst in people.

293
00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:45.620
- Jeffery. you coming to
Dianne's party tomorrow?

294
00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.020
- Of course I'm coming boss.

295
00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:51.163
- All right. I'll talk to you then.

296
00:19:51.163 --> 00:19:54.240
- Okay. thank you.

297
00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:57.150
Hey Lou. you wanna get some eat in

298
00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:58.890
after we drop his ass off?

299
00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:00.400
- Definitely.

300
00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.570
- [Agent] Look at that prick.
smiling at the cameras.

301
00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:05.100
- Yeah. keep waving asshole.

302
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:09.420
It's only a matter of time.

303
00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:10.630
- [Louis] Everyone knew
to keep their mouths shut

304
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:13.500
about business when the
flower truck was around.

305
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.490
I still don't know why
they weren't less obvious.

306
00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:18.990
Hey. so what's he wanna
see you 'bout tomorrow?

307
00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:21.660
- Probably business at
the club or something.

308
00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:22.493
Said something 'bout bringing

309
00:20:22.493 --> 00:20:24.280
some dancing girls in from Kansas.

310
00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.026
You know Diane fancy the erotic. huh.

311
00:20:26.026 --> 00:20:26.859
(men laughing)

312
00:20:26.859 --> 00:20:28.030
- Yeah. that's for sure.

313
00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.800
- Hey ma'am. could you top her off please?

314
00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.460
- Sure. yeah one sec.

315
00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.080
- Thank you.

316
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:34.913
She's beautiful.

317
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.900
It doesn't matter anyway. 'cause Maggie

318
00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.081
wanted to go to Diane's
after to celebrate.

319
00:20:41.081 --> 00:20:44.240
Said she wanted some new
expensive China set or some shit.

320
00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.842
You know how women are.

321
00:20:45.842 --> 00:20:47.120
- [Louis] Yeah.

322
00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.250
- Speaking of Maggie. I
actually gotta give her a call.

323
00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.289
Thank you.

324
00:20:51.289 --> 00:20:54.390
- Sure no problem. how
'bout you. want some?

325
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:55.350
- Uh.
- Have another cup.

326
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:58.055
I gotta call her. you know
how she freaks out right?

327
00:20:58.055 --> 00:20:59.076
- Yeah.

328
00:20:59.076 --> 00:20:59.926
- I'll take that.

329
00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:01.670
- Thank you.

330
00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:05.420
- Yeah. so what are
you guys up to tonight?

331
00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:06.770
- Ah. not much.

332
00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:08.220
You know we just had to go
pick a couple of things up

333
00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:10.100
and drop 'em off.

334
00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.125
- So you're just like
errand boys? (laughs)

335
00:21:13.125 --> 00:21:15.540
- No. I wouldn't say that's all we are.

336
00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.770
- Well. you're getting more
interesting by the minute.

337
00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.352
- Hey. what about you?

338
00:21:20.352 --> 00:21:21.560
I haven't seen you in here before.

339
00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.470
Normally it's good old
chain-smoking Doris.

340
00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:25.610
- Well. come back more
often and you'll find out.

341
00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.190
Excuse me. sir.
- Excuse me.

342
00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:31.060
Oh sorry sir.

343
00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:32.060
- Fuck your sorries.

344
00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:33.893
- What?

345
00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:37.893
- Hey Jeff.

346
00:21:43.831 --> 00:21:45.430
- Can you believe this fucking guy?

347
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:46.263
- Fuck him.

348
00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.830
- Can I get some service
around here or what?

349
00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:52.140
- [Waitress] One second. so sorry.

350
00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:53.640
- [Customer] And a coffee?

351
00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.473
- Yeah. sure.

352
00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.156
Sorry. it's just really
late and we're short-handed.

353
00:21:57.156 --> 00:22:00.213
- Yeah. come on with this.
- What's wrong with this guy?

354
00:22:00.213 --> 00:22:02.930
- Good job.
- Yeah. for sure.

355
00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:08.180
- Hey. could you do your damn job

356
00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:10.090
and get me a creamer that's not curdled?

357
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:13.210
- I'm so sorry. I'll be right back.

358
00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:16.420
- You ready to go?

359
00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.430
- What the fuck do you want?

360
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:29.290
- Just paying my bill.

361
00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:30.927
- Well you can go stand
somewhere else queer bait.

362
00:22:30.927 --> 00:22:31.760
(Louis gasping)

363
00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:32.788
- Queer. how?

364
00:22:32.788 --> 00:22:34.225
(men groaning)
(glass breaking)

365
00:22:34.225 --> 00:22:35.683
(upbeat music)

366
00:22:35.683 --> 00:22:38.410
Come on lil fuck. huh.

367
00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:41.150
Get up. what you gonna do now. huh?

368
00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:43.103
- Yeah. what now bitch.

369
00:22:43.103 --> 00:22:45.690
- You motherfucker. who's
the fucking queer. huh?

370
00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:49.370
Apologize Super Mario.
apologize. let's go.

371
00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:50.940
Come on Lou. let's go.

372
00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:51.980
Come with me. baby.

373
00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.520
- Whoa. what the hell happened out here?

374
00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.160
- Nothing. just paying my bill ma'am.

375
00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.230
Oh. I mean Wendy.

376
00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:04.554
- Well the owner actually said your bills

377
00:23:04.554 --> 00:23:06.360
are on the arm.

378
00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.490
- Well yeah. but that doesn't mean

379
00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:09.078
I can't tip for good service.

380
00:23:09.078 --> 00:23:10.210
- [Waitress] Good service?

381
00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:11.670
- Yeah. I mean none has been better.

382
00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:15.216
Oh and hey. the gentleman
that was sitting here.

383
00:23:15.216 --> 00:23:16.049
- [Waitress] Yeah.

384
00:23:16.049 --> 00:23:16.910
- He had to beat it.

385
00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:19.920
He accidentally spilled
his coffee on his way out.

386
00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.680
I don't know what his problem is.

387
00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.660
- Really.

388
00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:25.410
- Yeah. oh and actually left
you this for your trouble.

389
00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:27.770
- [Waitress] I don't believe you.

390
00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:29.600
- Hey. Scout's honor.

391
00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.179
- Yeah. you're no Boy Scout.

392
00:23:31.179 --> 00:23:33.650
- (laughs) Oh yeah. you caught me there.

393
00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:34.950
Hey. but the rest is true.

394
00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:40.280
And you know what. let me
help you pick up the mess.

395
00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.730
- So you can stare at my ass?

396
00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:44.680
- Why else?

397
00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:45.950
- Let me go get a mop.

398
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:47.303
- [Jeff] You hear me?

399
00:23:47.303 --> 00:23:49.970
(men screaming)

400
00:23:55.066 --> 00:23:57.150
- I have all the big glass pieces.

401
00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:58.830
- Well thank you. I'm sorry. your name.

402
00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:01.010
- [Lou] Louis. you can call me Lou.

403
00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:05.010
- Well I guess you can run
off with your friend. Lou.

404
00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:08.180
I got the rest. but thank you. really.

405
00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.013
- [Lou] Sure.

406
00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.610
- Hey. why don't you come back

407
00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:15.990
and we can talk some more.

408
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:18.011
- To you. I'll be back every night.

409
00:24:18.011 --> 00:24:20.844
(Wendy chuckling)

410
00:24:22.584 --> 00:24:23.501
- Oh great.

411
00:24:24.986 --> 00:24:26.204
(man screaming)

412
00:24:26.204 --> 00:24:27.560
- Why. you're not such a
fucking tough guy now. huh?

413
00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:28.393
- [Customer] Please.

414
00:24:28.393 --> 00:24:29.980
- It's not right to pick on a woman.

415
00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:31.880
I ever see you in that fucking
diner again. I'll kill you!

416
00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.180
I like that fucking diner!

417
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:35.200
I ain't the bad guy!

418
00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.310
What took you so long?

419
00:24:37.469 --> 00:24:39.430
- What are we gonna do
with the fucking trash?

420
00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:40.780
- I don't know man. he
look like he can't even

421
00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:43.680
take a beating like a
fucking man. fucking pussy!

422
00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:44.847
Tough guy!

423
00:24:44.847 --> 00:24:48.440
I say we drop his ass over an overpass.

424
00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:52.390
Huh. overpass. ass. fucking rhymes.

425
00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:55.370
- You're fucking crazy bro.
- Shit.

426
00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:56.380
- Let's just take him to the station

427
00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:57.950
and let Bill handle it.

428
00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:00.880
- What. when did you become
such a softy. Lou. fuck?

429
00:25:01.954 --> 00:25:03.320
- [Customer] Help.
please. I'll do anything.

430
00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:04.490
- Shut up. bitch!
- One thing you learn

431
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:07.870
being in Mancini's crew. always
treat women with respect.

432
00:25:08.782 --> 00:25:10.332
Jeff really took that to heart.

433
00:25:11.497 --> 00:25:14.164
(man screaming)

434
00:25:16.264 --> 00:25:18.784
Now Jeff was determined to be
different than his old man.

435
00:25:18.784 --> 00:25:21.790
Though. the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree sometimes.

436
00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.340
as he was never home for Maggie.

437
00:25:42.648 --> 00:25:44.893
(Jeff snoring)

438
00:25:44.893 --> 00:25:46.924
(glass breaking)

439
00:25:46.924 --> 00:25:48.406
- [Maggie] Where the fuck
have you been Jeffery?

440
00:25:48.406 --> 00:25:49.490
(Jeffery coughing)

441
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:51.210
- [Jeffery] Jesus Christ.

442
00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:52.060
- [Maggie] Where?

443
00:25:53.405 --> 00:25:56.020
- Jesus. I'm home aren't I?

444
00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:57.260
- [Maggie] Where. what. were you out

445
00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:59.140
fucking one of your whores?

446
00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.210
- No. no I wasn't!

447
00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:04.570
- [Maggie] You knew I had a
special night planned for us.

448
00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:06.360
I spent all day cooking.

449
00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.550
- Cooking?

450
00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:08.383
- [Maggie] Yeah. you piece of shit.

451
00:26:08.383 --> 00:26:10.825
- Babe. I'm sorry.

452
00:26:10.825 --> 00:26:14.269
- Babe. don't you babe me.
Jeff. don't you babe me.

453
00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:15.102
(glass breaking)

454
00:26:15.102 --> 00:26:17.730
- Oh my god. you psycho!

455
00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:19.720
Babe. I'm sorry.

456
00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.342
Don't you fucking throw
that at me. don't you dare.

457
00:26:22.342 --> 00:26:23.175
- I'm pissed.

458
00:26:23.175 --> 00:26:24.008
- [Jeff] No. don't.

459
00:26:24.008 --> 00:26:24.841
(body thudding)

460
00:26:24.841 --> 00:26:25.674
Aw. goddammit!

461
00:26:25.674 --> 00:26:27.140
Maggie. I had to work.

462
00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.740
- You always have to work.

463
00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:31.940
You're always putting the
family's needs before ours.

464
00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:34.321
- I'll put our needs first.
is that what you want?

465
00:26:34.321 --> 00:26:38.321
- Yeah. good.

466
00:26:38.321 --> 00:26:39.154
- Just calm down.

467
00:26:39.154 --> 00:26:41.750
Oh my God. dammit Maggie!

468
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:44.610
Vito had me doing things for
him. I couldn't get away.

469
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:46.180
- I don't care. you promised!

470
00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.150
- [Jeff] I love you. babe. you...

471
00:26:50.974 --> 00:26:52.391
Dammit. yes I do.

472
00:26:53.856 --> 00:26:55.273
Maggie. yes I do.

473
00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:00.570
- If you did. you would've
been home. (sobbing)

474
00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:04.560
Tonight was special Jeffery.
it was our anniversary.

475
00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:06.900
- Babe. what are you talking about?

476
00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:09.340
We got married on New Year's
six year ago. and it's July.

477
00:27:10.282 --> 00:27:12.660
- Not our wedding anniversary you dipshit.

478
00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.260
Our engagement anniversary.

479
00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:16.710
- Come on Maggie. are you serious?

480
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:19.955
Who the fuck remembers engagement
anniversaries honestly?

481
00:27:19.955 --> 00:27:23.210
- Well that's just it Jeffery.
you don't remember anything.

482
00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:25.840
- That's not true. I remember
Diane's birthday today.

483
00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.360
- Diane's birthday party.
you fucking remember

484
00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:29.810
Diane's birthday party!

485
00:27:30.886 --> 00:27:32.696
- Oh. for you I remember it.

486
00:27:32.696 --> 00:27:37.670
- For me. for me?

487
00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:40.210
You probably just said that because Vito

488
00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:41.690
had to remind you last night.

489
00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:42.870
- [Jeff] That's not true.

490
00:27:45.453 --> 00:27:46.286
- Really?

491
00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:49.455
- Really.

492
00:27:49.455 --> 00:27:52.205
(Maggie sobbing)

493
00:28:00.412 --> 00:28:02.912
I remember something else too.

494
00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:05.133
- Oh yeah?

495
00:28:07.128 --> 00:28:07.961
What?

496
00:28:16.377 --> 00:28:19.294
- I remember exactly what you like.

497
00:28:27.769 --> 00:28:30.026
(Maggie gasping)

498
00:28:30.026 --> 00:28:34.140
- You did remember.

499
00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:38.270
Oh Jeff.

500
00:28:41.401 --> 00:28:43.057
(phone buzzing)

501
00:28:43.057 --> 00:28:45.724
(Phone ringing)

502
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:53.100
- The life of a. I'll say businessman

503
00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:55.390
can be trying at times.

504
00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:58.930
Long hours spent in dark alleyways

505
00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:01.370
can really take a toll on ya.

506
00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:02.820
Both mentally and physically.

507
00:29:06.587 --> 00:29:07.420
Hello.

508
00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.480
Yeah Ma. I'll be there.

509
00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:23.307
But then again. so can your own family.

510
00:29:24.815 --> 00:29:27.982
(soft dramatic music)

511
00:30:04.063 --> 00:30:06.450
I've been in and out of a
lot of houses my entire life.

512
00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:07.900
both in town and out of town.

513
00:30:08.875 --> 00:30:11.910
But one thing always
remains a constant. my mom.

514
00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:14.870
- Took you long enough.
where have you been?

515
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:15.703
- [Lou] I'm here.

516
00:30:15.703 --> 00:30:16.970
- Oh. (kissing loudly). come on.

517
00:30:18.267 --> 00:30:19.290
Let's go. we're gonna be late.

518
00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:20.520
- I got you flowers.

519
00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:23.410
- Oh sweetheart. they're beautiful.

520
00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:25.610
They're perfect for your
father and your brother.

521
00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:26.550
- I got them for you.

522
00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:30.110
- Oh stop it. is traffic bad?

523
00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:31.540
- No. it was fine.

524
00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:44.060
- Happy anniversary. my love.

525
00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:52.890
- You see. after my dad
and brother passed away.

526
00:30:54.476 --> 00:30:55.926
we were left out on our feet.

527
00:31:00.875 --> 00:31:03.375
(mom sobbing)

528
00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:09.360
Even though my father didn't
get along with Mr. Mancini.

529
00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:12.890
he still took us under
his wing after Pop died.

530
00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:18.540
We owe everything to him.

531
00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.980
- I thought you'd like
another one of your toys

532
00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:22.030
to play with. Johnny.

533
00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:34.570
You're lucky Louis. lucky
they didn't take you that day.

534
00:31:35.904 --> 00:31:38.830
- I know. Mom. I know.

535
00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:50.641
- [Ma] You know. your
dad never really wanted

536
00:31:50.641 --> 00:31:52.020
any of the is for you.

537
00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:55.588
He worked so hard trying to get out.

538
00:31:55.588 --> 00:31:57.350
- Yeah Ma. I know.

539
00:31:57.350 --> 00:32:00.250
- That's why we started that
farm. he loved those animals.

540
00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:05.829
Why can't you just. why can't
you just find a nice girl.

541
00:32:05.829 --> 00:32:07.970
settle down somewhere warm.

542
00:32:09.462 --> 00:32:10.640
- I don't know. it's tough.

543
00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.158
Mancini really expects a lot.

544
00:32:12.158 --> 00:32:14.320
(Ma sighing)

545
00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.330
He really helped us out a
lot when Dad and Johnny died.

546
00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:17.820
He didn't have to.

547
00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:20.170
- Your dad just always
thought he was a puppet.

548
00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:24.900
You know what I'd really like to see?

549
00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:26.080
- [Lou] No Ma. what?

550
00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.860
- [Ma] You. happy again.

551
00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:32.083
- Ma. I am happy.

552
00:32:32.083 --> 00:32:37.049
♪ Happy birthday dear Diane ♪

553
00:32:37.049 --> 00:32:40.382
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

554
00:32:41.318 --> 00:32:46.318
(everyone cheering)
(everyone clapping)

555
00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:48.670
- Vito Mancini was known

556
00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:50.550
for conducting meetings during events.

557
00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:52.540
It allows him to kill
two birds with one stone.

558
00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:54.400
Spend time with his friends and family.

559
00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.400
while making it absolutely
fucking impossible

560
00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.600
for audio surveillance.

561
00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:01.550
- [Jeff] Thank you so much for having us.

562
00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:04.010
Maggie's really excited to be here.

563
00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:05.850
- Diane wouldn't have it any other way.

564
00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:07.480
- Was it it you wanted to see me about?

565
00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:10.181
- [Vito] Straight to the point.

566
00:33:10.181 --> 00:33:11.014
(static buzzing)

567
00:33:11.014 --> 00:33:11.847
Respect.

568
00:33:16.961 --> 00:33:18.180
- You know this would be
a hell of a lot easier

569
00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:19.740
if you didn't use the damn cell phone

570
00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:21.610
around all this gear.

571
00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:23.960
- Hey Princess Leia. I'm
trying to call my kid.

572
00:33:26.353 --> 00:33:27.660
- I'm just saying. doesn't really help

573
00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:28.760
with the interference.

574
00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:31.420
- Can't really see anything.

575
00:33:32.763 --> 00:33:34.690
Could you have parked any further away?

576
00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:37.200
- Yeah. go fuck yourself.

577
00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.850
- Would everyone just shut up.

578
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:46.370
- Jeffery it seems we
have a rat in our midst.

579
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:49.350
- [Jeff] You believe what the
cop was saying about DeFrange?

580
00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:55.480
- I don't need to believe him.
I sent him there to kill him.

581
00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:57.950
- You telling me you knew DeFrange

582
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:59.730
was an informant from beforehand?

583
00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:02.400
- Jeffery. things under my
watch don't go unnoticed.

584
00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:06.910
I suspected DeFrange's
allegiance was elsewhere.

585
00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:09.560
After I got word that his cousin

586
00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.810
from the Windy City was nabbed.

587
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:13.310
no charges ever filed on him.

588
00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.210
I have many moles Jeffery.

589
00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:20.810
They keep me apprise of
all my family matters.

590
00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:27.344
- Thank you Honey Bunny for
the gifts and the party.

591
00:34:27.344 --> 00:34:29.430
- Mmm. oh you are welcome.

592
00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:31.800
Oh. would you get me another

593
00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.660
while I finish up talking to Jeff here?

594
00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:34.493
- Of course.

595
00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:37.980
- You're a lucky man.

596
00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:40.300
- Jesus. don't I know it.

597
00:34:43.833 --> 00:34:44.666
- Let me ask ya.

598
00:34:44.666 --> 00:34:45.499
- [Vito] Hmm?

599
00:34:45.499 --> 00:34:46.400
- Why didn't you just
whack DeFrange at the house

600
00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.200
last night by yourself?

601
00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:51.050
- [Vito] 'Cause I want
you to dispose of it.

602
00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:52.250
- Vito. I can't do that.

603
00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:55.320
I'm. he's a made guy.

604
00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.020
He's got a wife and kids. what about them?

605
00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:00.170
- Yes. I know it. Jeff.

606
00:35:01.541 --> 00:35:02.870
I'll take care of it.

607
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:04.790
- Come on. we gonna get this audio or not?

608
00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:06.893
- I'm trying.

609
00:35:06.893 --> 00:35:09.000
- Jesus.
- Jesus. I'm trying.

610
00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:11.970
- Why is she even here?

611
00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:13.080
She's worthless.

612
00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:15.610
- You know why. Agent Burns.

613
00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:17.660
She was the best young
trainee out of Quantico.

614
00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:19.457
Just like you were a few years ago.

615
00:35:20.675 --> 00:35:23.425
(static buzzing)

616
00:35:25.761 --> 00:35:28.560
- And I talked to the
families about the matter.

617
00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:31.901
They want it done quietly.
so as not to arouse

618
00:35:31.901 --> 00:35:36.630
any attention from the FBI. (laughs)

619
00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:39.020
- When you want this to be done?

620
00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:39.870
- [Vito] Tonight.

621
00:35:44.347 --> 00:35:45.899
- [Diane] Here's a drink for my big man.

622
00:35:45.899 --> 00:35:50.899
(Vito laughing)
(kissing loudly)

623
00:35:55.910 --> 00:36:00.300
- Oh. oh. you are the devil. oh.

624
00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:06.479
- Hey salud huh.

625
00:36:06.479 --> 00:36:07.568
(audience laughing)

626
00:36:07.568 --> 00:36:08.401
- Salud.

627
00:36:10.661 --> 00:36:14.444
(Jeff speaking in foreign language)

628
00:36:14.444 --> 00:36:17.031
- Oh damn. she is smoking hot.

629
00:36:17.031 --> 00:36:19.700
- Yeah well. she stonewalled
us the other night.

630
00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:20.533
- Bitch.

631
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:23.460
- We've got the feds so pissed off

632
00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.010
at the newly wed Diane Mancini.

633
00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:28.351
It was not that she didn't talk.

634
00:36:28.351 --> 00:36:30.205
but how she went about doing it.

635
00:36:30.205 --> 00:36:32.788
(upbeat music)

636
00:36:37.582 --> 00:36:42.582
- Inhale. reach in low.

637
00:36:44.835 --> 00:36:45.668
Gently start to fall.

638
00:36:45.668 --> 00:36:49.418
(music drowning out speaker)

639
00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:57.290
Walk your hands forward.

640
00:37:11.658 --> 00:37:14.325
(door slamming)

641
00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:19.660
- [Agent] Mrs. Mancini. we need to talk.

642
00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:22.570
- Who the fuck are you?

643
00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:24.930
- We're with the FBI. have a few questions

644
00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:27.510
about your husband. Vincent Mancini.

645
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:29.550
- I should have known
by the two fucking suits

646
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:31.080
and the tacky shoes.

647
00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:32.790
- [Agent] Mrs. Mancini. how aware of you

648
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:34.100
of your husband's affairs?

649
00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:37.110
- Oh I'd say I'm pretty aware
of my husband's affairs.

650
00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:38.400
- Oh well then you are pretty aware

651
00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:40.950
of just how dangerous a
man your husband really is.

652
00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:43.820
Look. you wanna share what you know.

653
00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:45.540
and we could offer you a deal.

654
00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:47.291
Maybe even protection.

655
00:37:47.291 --> 00:37:50.041
(Diane laughing)

656
00:37:56.425 --> 00:37:58.925
- You know. you're awful
tense for a man your age.

657
00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:06.530
Maybe I could help you find your center.

658
00:38:08.284 --> 00:38:11.910
I could teach you ways to find relaxation

659
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:14.210
in that tight body of yours.

660
00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:16.760
- [Agent] Mrs. Mancini.

661
00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:18.188
- Yes.

662
00:38:18.188 --> 00:38:22.110
- Okay. Mrs. Mancini. you
can stop with the games.

663
00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:23.510
You've got two choices here.

664
00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:26.770
One. you can help us put Vincent Mancini

665
00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:29.610
away for a long time
and you get a new name

666
00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:32.410
and a nice house out in
Who-gives-a-fucksville.

667
00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:36.060
Or if you're lucky. you'll be charged

668
00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:38.490
as an accomplice when we
bring him down without you.

669
00:38:38.490 --> 00:38:41.150
And I say lucky because Vincent Mancini

670
00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:43.680
isn't the kind of man who likes lose ends.

671
00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:46.040
You do know what happened

672
00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:48.260
to the former Mrs. Mancini don't you?

673
00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:52.250
Probably the same thing
that'll happen to you

674
00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:53.640
once your end gets loose.

675
00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.410
- What's that supposed to mean?

676
00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:57.243
- That he had her killed

677
00:38:57.243 --> 00:38:59.320
on a shopping trip to New York City.

678
00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:01.390
Hey. that's right around the time

679
00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:04.020
he met the current Mrs. Mancini wasn't it?

680
00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:06.310
- I believe that's right. whoa.

681
00:39:08.194 --> 00:39:09.027
- Fuck you.

682
00:39:09.027 --> 00:39:10.180
You actually think you can harass me

683
00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.310
into talking with your bullshit?

684
00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:13.810
- [Agent] Bullshit. come here.

685
00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:17.380
You call this bullshit?

686
00:39:19.237 --> 00:39:20.880
The sick bastard had his own wife killed

687
00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.690
while she was in the bathtub.

688
00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:24.811
Strangled to death with her fucking bra.

689
00:39:24.811 --> 00:39:25.644
(lady gasping)

690
00:39:25.644 --> 00:39:27.890
Thrashing. fighting. till her last breath.

691
00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:31.550
They didn't find her till
the following afternoon.

692
00:39:32.521 --> 00:39:34.090
And don't think for one second

693
00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:35.790
he won't do the same thing to you.

694
00:39:36.627 --> 00:39:39.060
I am offering you a way out here.

695
00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:41.370
Help us before he decides toss you aside.

696
00:39:41.370 --> 00:39:43.720
Do you really wanna go to jail?

697
00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:47.213
Or worse. tits up strangled
with your own goddamn underwear?

698
00:39:47.213 --> 00:39:50.071
(dramatic music)

699
00:39:50.071 --> 00:39:51.371
- I rarely wear underwear.

700
00:39:55.618 --> 00:40:00.618
- Oh. you see what the
FBI didn't realize is.

701
00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:05.260
Diane Mancini knew exactly
who her husband was.

702
00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:07.860
And trust me. she was
no damsel in distress

703
00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:08.760
who needed saving.

704
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.249
Now they met back in Chicago
when Vito was on business

705
00:40:12.249 --> 00:40:14.610
and she was in this artsy play.

706
00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:18.370
You know. the kind where they
wear more skin than costume.

707
00:40:19.893 --> 00:40:23.020
Anyways. for the highlight of the show.

708
00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:25.860
she comes out center stage.

709
00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:27.900
up on a pedestal completely naked.

710
00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:31.400
For Vito. it was love at first sight.

711
00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.020
And it wasn't too soon after that.

712
00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:36.550
that she felt the same way about him.

713
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:39.210
Only problem was. Vito's wife.

714
00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:41.710
And who wants to deal
with a messy divorce?

715
00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:44.707
I'll give you one guess whose idea it was.

716
00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:50.560
- Well this has been fun boys.

717
00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:53.060
but I've got things to do.
so if you'll excuse me.

718
00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:01.363
Night boys.

719
00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:09.340
- Well that didn't go as
well as I would have liked.

720
00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:11.900
- That's okay. we'll
wear her down eventually.

721
00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:16.530
- No. you won't.

722
00:41:19.632 --> 00:41:22.860
(upbeat music)

723
00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:25.320
John DeFrange. a pretty funny guy

724
00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:27.756
if you weren't on the
butt end of his jokes.

725
00:41:27.756 --> 00:41:30.000
He was always trying to
be the life of the party.

726
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.700
Got in him trouble a few
time. but luckily for him

727
00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:35.200
the family was always
there to get his back.

728
00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.770
Although lately. seemed
to be getting rather close

729
00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:40.600
to Mancini and pushing
hard against Jeffery Torin.

730
00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:42.764
That's pretty big no-nos.
since Jeff's whole family

731
00:41:42.764 --> 00:41:45.100
had been taken by mob
heads during the Cold War

732
00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:46.360
between Cleveland and Pittsburgh.

733
00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:48.000
But that was before the family united

734
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.160
against the common goal.
ridding the town of the FBI.

735
00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:55.550
- Well look. I it ain't the
two cornholers. (laughs)

736
00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:59.750
So. what has old Vito
got us doing tonight?

737
00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:00.790
- Mancini wants us to get--

738
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:03.011
- Hey. hey. hey. why
don't you grab me a pint.

739
00:42:03.011 --> 00:42:04.470
while I talk to these guys.

740
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:05.680
- Why don't you kiss my ass.

741
00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:09.090
- I better get my shots first! (laughs)

742
00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:12.450
- You finish being a show clown?

743
00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:14.140
- She felt like a he-she anyways.

744
00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:17.640
Never mind me. it's not a penis

745
00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:21.830
it's just my oversized
clitoris! (laughing)

746
00:42:23.841 --> 00:42:26.173
You ever fuck one of those things before?

747
00:42:26.173 --> 00:42:27.006
(man whistling)

748
00:42:27.006 --> 00:42:28.310
It'll give you nightmares for a month.

749
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:32.080
What. not funny?

750
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:35.140
Okay. okay. all work and no play.

751
00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:36.470
- Mancini wants us to scare

752
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:38.820
this country club worker a little bit.

753
00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:40.000
- So what. we bop the guy?

754
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.240
- No. we don't bop the guy.

755
00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:42.640
- Are you crazy. motherfucker?

756
00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.080
- [John] People scare
better when they're dying.

757
00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:44.913
that's all I'm saying.

758
00:42:44.913 --> 00:42:46.780
- Okay Henry Fonda. look we ride together.

759
00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:48.150
You're driving. your riding shotgun.

760
00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:49.800
you're just so trigger happy man.

761
00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:52.490
- That's the best you got?

762
00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:54.320
That's not even an insult.

763
00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:58.390
I love Steve McQueen
motherfuckers. lets ride! (laughs)

764
00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:09.510
- Summer nights were crisp and dark

765
00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:11.660
perfect for the underworld's dealings

766
00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:13.310
of scaring the shit outta people.

767
00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:17.380
But that night. Jeff has
something different in mind.

768
00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:20.740
I still don't understand
why he didn't tell me prior.

769
00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:24.163
- Make a left over here.

770
00:43:24.163 --> 00:43:25.110
we're gonna go in the back way

771
00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:26.640
so he won't see us coming.

772
00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:27.660
- Bt the club isn't for another mile.

773
00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:29.356
- Just fucking do it. Lou!

774
00:43:29.356 --> 00:43:32.260
- Okay. that's gonna
be a long fucking walk.

775
00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:34.490
- I need the fresh air anyway.

776
00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:36.320
DeFrange hand me your gun.

777
00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:37.830
- Fuck you. why?

778
00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:39.870
- Because. I don't want
you killing anybody

779
00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:41.710
'cause you're a fucking lunatic.

780
00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:43.760
Plus Mancini wants this
to be done delicately.

781
00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:46.250
- Well fuck him too. I'm not
giving you my gun cocksuckers.

782
00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:47.870
- [Lou] Just fucking do it.

783
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:50.030
The sooner we get this done.
the sooner we can get home.

784
00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:51.700
- Take it easy. Lou.

785
00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:53.190
Fine. take the fucking gun.

786
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:54.770
I don't care. but I want it returned

787
00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:55.930
in the order in which it was received.

788
00:43:55.930 --> 00:43:57.010
- How 'bout I shove it up your ass

789
00:43:57.010 --> 00:43:58.250
and pull the trigger. motherfucker?

790
00:43:58.250 --> 00:43:59.500
- You wanna do it right now. cocksucker?

791
00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:00.560
- Let's go.
- Let's go then.

792
00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:03.290
Let's go. huh. kick your
ass. motherfucker. (laughs)

793
00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:05.410
- [Lou] Sit the fuck down.

794
00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:07.957
Jesus fucking Christ. I'm trying to drive.

795
00:44:07.957 --> 00:44:09.000
Fucking bitch.

796
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.200
- [Jeff] Fucking Christ.

797
00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:14.090
Lou. this is good. pull over here.

798
00:44:15.250 --> 00:44:20.250
- [Lou] All right.

799
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:33.130
- DeFrange knew his fate.

800
00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:35.230
he just wasn't allowing himself to see it.

801
00:44:36.713 --> 00:44:38.360
And I knew too.

802
00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:40.570
The moment we turned down
this godforsaken road.

803
00:44:42.338 --> 00:44:43.171
Oh fuck.

804
00:44:43.171 --> 00:44:44.004
- [John] Cut that shit out Jeff.

805
00:44:44.004 --> 00:44:44.910
- [Jeff] How's your little cousin doing

806
00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:46.750
after Chicago these days?

807
00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:48.247
- [John] What the fuck you talking about?

808
00:44:48.247 --> 00:44:49.080
(gun cocking)

809
00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:51.090
Whoa. whoa. whoa. hey. but how did you?

810
00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:52.432
- No buts. Mancini found out

811
00:44:52.432 --> 00:44:54.630
and you know what's coming.

812
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:56.080
- [John] Jeff. I've got a wife and kids.

813
00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:57.590
- [Jeff] That you treat like shit.

814
00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:01.170
Now fucking stop giving
me crybaby bullshit.

815
00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:02.390
- [John] Lou. Lou.

816
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:04.320
- Hey. don't look at me.

817
00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:05.153
This Jeff's show.

818
00:45:05.153 --> 00:45:06.730
- [Jeff] He had nothing to do with this.

819
00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:08.310
Mancini wants this to be done quietly

820
00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:09.470
as the not arouse the attention

821
00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:11.860
of your little FBI buddies you queer.

822
00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:13.830
- [John] That was my little
cousin. I had to do it.

823
00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:14.663
He would never

824
00:45:14.663 --> 00:45:15.496
make it inside.
- Not my concern.

825
00:45:15.496 --> 00:45:16.640
open the trunk!

826
00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:18.620
- Wait. wait. wait. what the
fuck did you put in my trunk?

827
00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:19.453
- [Jeff] Don't worry about it.

828
00:45:19.453 --> 00:45:20.850
open the fucking goddamn trunk now!

829
00:45:23.027 --> 00:45:23.860
Move!

830
00:45:25.045 --> 00:45:26.860
- In our line of work.
its only a few things

831
00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:28.010
that can be in a trunk.

832
00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:32.320
Golf clubs and a shovel.

833
00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:33.850
- [Jeff] Pick it up!

834
00:45:33.850 --> 00:45:36.340
- Fitting. gangster's burial. so to speak.

835
00:45:38.793 --> 00:45:40.720
Now that I look back at it. kinda sad.

836
00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:44.750
Yo. yo. yo. yo. you
sure you wanna do this?

837
00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:45.583
He's fucking made.

838
00:45:45.583 --> 00:45:47.340
- You don't think I know that Lou?

839
00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:49.380
Mancini's orders. the family has spoken.

840
00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:52.390
- Okay. but I'm not gonna be the one

841
00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:54.180
buying his kids fucking
Christmas presents.

842
00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:56.170
- Mancini's got that taken care of.

843
00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:58.600
Hey you green tie joker bastard fuck.

844
00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:01.610
you ready to be my bitch
caddy for the night. huh?

845
00:46:01.610 --> 00:46:02.930
If you're lucky. maybe I'll let you live

846
00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:04.690
to play all 18. huh.

847
00:46:04.690 --> 00:46:06.830
Don't be scared. get on
your knees and crawl bitch.

848
00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:08.340
get on your knees and crawl!

849
00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:10.150
Go. move. move!

850
00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:15.853
- Fuck.

851
00:46:24.314 --> 00:46:26.094
It never felt right to me.

852
00:46:26.094 --> 00:46:27.494
A man digging his own grave.

853
00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:30.170
Torture. especially in my line of work.

854
00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:31.320
it gets a man thinking.

855
00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:34.490
Has him just waiting for the inevitable.

856
00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:37.430
I'd rather die in the streets.

857
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:39.000
At least go out with some fucking dignity.

858
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.170
That's what this was all about.

859
00:46:41.170 --> 00:46:44.110
A no name grave. swallowed whole.

860
00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:45.510
dead in a fucking sand trap.

861
00:46:46.377 --> 00:46:49.377
(DeFrange grunting)

862
00:46:52.734 --> 00:46:54.210
- [Jeff] All right. that's enough.

863
00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:55.043
Don't get tired.

864
00:46:55.043 --> 00:46:57.050
- [John] I'm not done yet.

865
00:46:58.390 --> 00:47:01.860
- [Jeff] I don't care John.
show some dignity. get out!

866
00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:06.720
- [John] Please Jeffy. hey
Jeff. you don't have to do this.

867
00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:08.970
I could go away. no one'll ever know.

868
00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:11.100
You'll never see me again.

869
00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:12.010
- Johnny. really?

870
00:47:12.010 --> 00:47:13.146
- Yeah.

871
00:47:13.146 --> 00:47:13.979
- You don't have to do this?

872
00:47:13.979 --> 00:47:14.812
- [John] No. no.

873
00:47:14.812 --> 00:47:15.645
- You hear that. I don't have to do this.

874
00:47:15.645 --> 00:47:16.730
- [John] Yeah.

875
00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:17.563
- Fuck you. I'm doing it.

876
00:47:17.563 --> 00:47:18.600
You have any words you want to say

877
00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:20.097
before I fucking kill you?

878
00:47:20.097 --> 00:47:23.182
- [John] Yeah. you. fuck you.

879
00:47:23.182 --> 00:47:26.040
- Fuck me. huh. huh?

880
00:47:26.962 --> 00:47:28.389
(gun banging)

881
00:47:28.389 --> 00:47:29.683
Fuck you!

882
00:47:29.683 --> 00:47:32.001
Fuck you!
(gun banging)

883
00:47:32.001 --> 00:47:33.501
Fuck you and the fucking boss!

884
00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:36.070
Fuck you!

885
00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:36.903
- [Lou] Do you think you could've

886
00:47:36.903 --> 00:47:39.210
given him some time to finish?

887
00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:42.450
- Yeah sure. salivate a
little more. don't you think?

888
00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:46.580
Fucking hungry. starving.
Maggie made some chicken parm.

889
00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:48.370
wanna get the fuck outta here.

890
00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:50.070
There's leftovers. you wanna come?

891
00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:52.700
- Couldn't you have at least shot him

892
00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:54.850
so he fell all the way
in the fucking hole?

893
00:47:56.570 --> 00:47:58.050
- Got the hammer and snips?

894
00:47:58.050 --> 00:47:59.380
- [Lou] No. why the
fuck would I have that?

895
00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:01.180
I didn't even know this
was going on tonight.

896
00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:03.729
- [Jeff] If you're gonna
fucking bitch at me.

897
00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:04.910
I'll go get 'em.

898
00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:06.340
- [Lou] Jeff. you really
need to see somebody.

899
00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:07.960
- [Jeff] What are you talking 'bout?

900
00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:09.210
- [Lou] A fucking shrink.

901
00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:13.520
Jeff and I have dealt with
situations in the past.

902
00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:15.590
But none so close to home.

903
00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:17.350
I mean whacking one of our own.

904
00:48:17.350 --> 00:48:19.210
that hasn't been done in a while.

905
00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:21.340
And Jeff keeping me out of the loop.

906
00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:23.280
that gives me knots in my
stomach just thinking about

907
00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:25.100
what else might be planned in the future.

908
00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:31.650
- Easy there Mr. Soreno. it's the tin man.

909
00:48:31.650 --> 00:48:33.697
I just wanna talk for a few minutes.

910
00:48:33.697 --> 00:48:35.050
- [Lou] Go fuck yourself.

911
00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:36.300
That'll do you some good.

912
00:48:39.806 --> 00:48:41.106
- I'd rather fuck my wife.

913
00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:44.070
Listen. if you cooperate. I'll leave.

914
00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:47.850
Must've been a real dirty job last night.

915
00:48:49.070 --> 00:48:52.560
Well. if you ever wanna talk
about it. I'll be around.

916
00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:54.370
Just think of me as your priest.

917
00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:56.620
confess all and you shall be redeemed.

918
00:48:59.323 --> 00:49:00.850
- I'm not getting on my knees for you.

919
00:49:15.448 --> 00:49:17.955
- Hmm. well if it isn't
my favorite customer.

920
00:49:17.955 --> 00:49:20.130
What can I get cha?

921
00:49:20.130 --> 00:49:22.180
- Uh. I'll just have a cup of coffee.

922
00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:24.559
- Black?
- Yeah. yeah.

923
00:49:24.559 --> 00:49:27.300
- [Wendy] Cool.

924
00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:29.390
What's wrong. is everything okay?

925
00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:30.680
- [Lou] Not exactly.

926
00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:31.513
- Okay.

927
00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:34.340
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

928
00:49:35.608 --> 00:49:37.280
- Is it Sunday already. jeez.

929
00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:39.881
- [Wendy] What do you mean?

930
00:49:39.881 --> 00:49:43.230
- Hmm. it reminds me of my
mom after my dad passed.

931
00:49:44.170 --> 00:49:45.710
She always used to take me to breakfast

932
00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:46.940
every Sunday morning before church.

933
00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:49.624
It was just us you
know. kind of our thing.

934
00:49:49.624 --> 00:49:51.850
- Hmm. reminds me of my family too.

935
00:49:51.850 --> 00:49:54.270
minus the breakfast though. we was poor.

936
00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:55.103
Be right back.

937
00:49:55.103 --> 00:49:55.936
- [Lou] Okay.

938
00:49:58.264 --> 00:49:59.781
- [Wendy] Hey. what can I get you guys?

939
00:49:59.781 --> 00:50:00.834
- [Mom] I'll have a water please.

940
00:50:00.834 --> 00:50:01.667
- [Wendy] A water.

941
00:50:01.667 --> 00:50:02.500
- [Child] Chocolate milk for me please.

942
00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:04.011
- [Wendy] Chocolate.

943
00:50:04.011 --> 00:50:05.910
- Orange pop for me.

944
00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:08.100
- [Wendy] Awesome. I
shall get that for you

945
00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:09.570
with extra chocolate.

946
00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:13.420
- [Lou] Hey ah.

947
00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:14.640
- Yep.

948
00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:16.746
- I got their bill covered.
get 'em whatever they want.

949
00:50:16.746 --> 00:50:18.090
- Really?
- Yeah.

950
00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:19.470
- [Wendy] Why?

951
00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:21.610
- Being a single mom can't be easy.

952
00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:24.770
Lord knows mine had it pretty tough.

953
00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:26.108
And I always had somebody
there to help me out.

954
00:50:26.108 --> 00:50:27.708
so just kinda paying it forward.

955
00:50:30.006 --> 00:50:31.570
Hey. I was looking at that.

956
00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:35.584
- Well look like you could
use a home-cooked breakfast.

957
00:50:35.584 --> 00:50:37.290
- Yeah. I could.

958
00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:42.360
- Why don't you come out
with me to the country.

959
00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:44.760
And I'll cook you something good.

960
00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:47.780
Here you go. chocolate milk. what.

961
00:50:49.379 --> 00:50:51.780
- It's funny. in a blink of an eye

962
00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:53.850
sometimes things can
change for the better.

963
00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:59.780
So when you say nice country breakfast.

964
00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:01.870
what exactly do you mean?

965
00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:03.880
- The best damn breakfast you ever had.

966
00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:06.180
- [Lou] But why me?

967
00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:08.015
- Hmm. just paying it forward.

968
00:51:08.015 --> 00:51:10.150
(both laughing)

969
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:11.964
- Okay then. plus I haven't
been out to the country

970
00:51:11.964 --> 00:51:14.400
in a long time. since I was a kid.

971
00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:15.300
- Really?
- Yeah.

972
00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:22.760
- So uh. how does a girl like
you afford a place like this?

973
00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:24.546
- What. a waitress can't afford it?

974
00:51:24.546 --> 00:51:25.700
- [Lou] Uh.

975
00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:29.590
- No. my grandfather passed
away a few years back

976
00:51:29.590 --> 00:51:32.690
and I inherited it from him.

977
00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:35.140
And it's been really hard to
take care of this place alone.

978
00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:38.200
- So what about your parents?

979
00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:39.520
Why don't they help out?

980
00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:41.310
- You mean my Petri dish
father. who I never met?

981
00:51:41.310 --> 00:51:43.550
He left before I was born.

982
00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:45.230
My mother. that's another story.

983
00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:46.330
She was a drug addict.

984
00:51:47.230 --> 00:51:49.430
Overdosed in front of me when I was four.

985
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:50.800
I rant out into the street screaming

986
00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:52.790
for someone to help. but nobody came.

987
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:56.090
My grandfather picked me up

988
00:51:56.090 --> 00:51:57.940
at the police station and took me in.

989
00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:00.540
He was always so good to me.

990
00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.050
He raised me to be a good person.

991
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.870
God knows where I'd be without him.

992
00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:10.150
Anyway. enough of my dismal past.

993
00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:11.520
So how is the food. any good?

994
00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:13.630
- Ah. it's amazing.

995
00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:15.751
I haven't had a meal
this good in a long time.

996
00:52:15.751 --> 00:52:17.820
- Good. (chuckles)

997
00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:20.900
- So. actually what am I supposed to do

998
00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:22.610
to pay you back for this?

999
00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:26.120
- That's a surprise. so you better eat up.

1000
00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:28.210
- Okay. (chuckles)

1001
00:52:37.873 --> 00:52:40.270
How do you feel about doing some cleaning?

1002
00:52:40.270 --> 00:52:42.270
- Hey for the chef. anything.

1003
00:52:43.330 --> 00:52:47.720
- Wheelbarrow's over there.
and the two back stalls.

1004
00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:48.812
- Aren't you gonna supervise?

1005
00:52:48.812 --> 00:52:53.812
- [Chuckles] I will. I'll be right back.

1006
00:52:54.005 --> 00:52:59.005
- Okay.

1007
00:53:03.236 --> 00:53:08.236
Oh man.

1008
00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:11.800
Man I must be seeing things.

1009
00:53:17.850 --> 00:53:21.990
Just like Frankie's song.
you're just too good to be true.

1010
00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:23.240
- Well hey there. cowboy.

1011
00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:28.370
Why don't you take a break and
take Cisco here for a ride.

1012
00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:30.570
- Okay. but I'm warning
you. it's been a long time

1013
00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:31.820
since I've been on one of these.

1014
00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:34.240
- I figured a man like you
knew how to take the reigns.

1015
00:53:37.268 --> 00:53:40.018
(relaxing music)

1016
00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:46.412
- Well. do you really
like your kind of work?

1017
00:53:46.412 --> 00:53:48.780
- Ah. it can be trying at times.

1018
00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:49.750
- What do you mean?

1019
00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:53.440
- Well I've never really
had a choice in the matter.

1020
00:53:56.530 --> 00:54:00.050
You see. my pop was brought
out here by the company.

1021
00:54:01.233 --> 00:54:04.120
and he ended up dying on the
job along with my brother.

1022
00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:04.953
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1023
00:54:09.334 --> 00:54:11.360
- I don't get it though.
it doesn't seem like

1024
00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:13.500
this type of work suits
a caring guy like you.

1025
00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:15.370
I mean why. why don't you just leave?

1026
00:54:16.253 --> 00:54:18.640
- (chuckles) I wish I could.

1027
00:54:21.488 --> 00:54:22.990
I don't have anywhere to go.

1028
00:54:22.990 --> 00:54:25.290
I owe so much of my existence
to a friend of the family.

1029
00:54:25.290 --> 00:54:28.320
I mean he did so much for
us through the hard times.

1030
00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:31.000
He basically gave my mom the
house that she lives in now.

1031
00:54:32.181 --> 00:54:34.760
Plus if I did go. I'd be all alone.

1032
00:54:36.697 --> 00:54:39.430
You know at least here. I
have my friend Jeff and you.

1033
00:54:41.142 --> 00:54:45.010
- (laughs) Me. oh gosh. well yeah.

1034
00:54:45.010 --> 00:54:47.417
you're growing on me a little bit too.

1035
00:54:47.417 --> 00:54:48.470
- Oh thank you.

1036
00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:51.290
- So are you hot?

1037
00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:54.400
- Yeah. I mean it's kinda muggy.

1038
00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:58.770
- I have a surprise. I
think you'll like it.

1039
00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:01.460
I'm gonna go get Jasper. follow me.

1040
00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:02.293
- Okay.

1041
00:55:25.444 --> 00:55:26.277
Oh man.

1042
00:55:29.816 --> 00:55:33.440
This place certainly is beautiful.

1043
00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:35.870
I haven't been this relaxed in a long tie.

1044
00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:38.330
So how'd you ever found this spot?

1045
00:55:38.330 --> 00:55:40.624
- See that path right over there?

1046
00:55:40.624 --> 00:55:41.457
- Yeah.

1047
00:55:41.457 --> 00:55:43.210
- My grandfather took me for rides

1048
00:55:43.210 --> 00:55:46.030
and then he'd lead me here
to cool off in the water.

1049
00:55:47.450 --> 00:55:50.054
It used to be like my
own private vacation.

1050
00:55:50.054 --> 00:55:53.080
- [Lou] Oh. it certainly is amazing.

1051
00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:55.580
- [Wendy] Yeah. it reminds
me of better times.

1052
00:55:55.580 --> 00:55:58.080
Not that today is turning
out to be rather special.

1053
00:55:58.080 --> 00:55:59.710
- Oh yeah. you really mean that?

1054
00:55:59.710 --> 00:56:01.270
- Of course I do.

1055
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:04.270
Look. I don't do things
that don't make me happy.

1056
00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:08.050
except my job. it's an income.
that's its only purpose.

1057
00:56:08.050 --> 00:56:11.790
and it puts you in my
freaking break in the morning.

1058
00:56:11.790 --> 00:56:14.220
- [Lou] Yeah. well we
all have to do things

1059
00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:15.930
that we don't want to do.

1060
00:56:15.930 --> 00:56:17.980
You know just to get ahead.

1061
00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:20.128
- Is that what you're
trying to do. get some head?

1062
00:56:20.128 --> 00:56:21.980
- (laughs) Who me. nah?

1063
00:56:24.533 --> 00:56:26.810
- Well what are you
expecting out of today?

1064
00:56:26.810 --> 00:56:28.210
- I don't know. you tell me.

1065
00:56:29.450 --> 00:56:30.620
I just took a beautiful waitress out

1066
00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:33.410
for some much need R&R out in the country.

1067
00:56:33.410 --> 00:56:34.800
- You really mean that?

1068
00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:37.400
- Of course I do. I wouldn't
have said it otherwise.

1069
00:56:38.327 --> 00:56:40.727
Good advice I learned
from a new friend of mine.

1070
00:56:41.590 --> 00:56:43.731
- [Wendy] Cute. cute. stealing the words

1071
00:56:43.731 --> 00:56:45.950
right out my mouth. yeah. (laughs)

1072
00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:47.250
- I'd rather steal a kiss.

1073
00:56:48.606 --> 00:56:49.500
- Then why don't you?

1074
00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:55.010
- Nah. I don't want to
make it too easy for ya.

1075
00:56:55.010 --> 00:56:56.870
Just stay here with me for
a lil while longer. okay?

1076
00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:06.700
I could've sat there
forever with her in my arms.

1077
00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:08.760
I was watching the water
cascade over the rocks

1078
00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:10.550
into the pool below.

1079
00:57:10.550 --> 00:57:13.533
It seemed peace had finally come over me.

1080
00:57:13.533 --> 00:57:15.480
It had been such a long time.

1081
00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:17.429
We had connected deep that day.

1082
00:57:17.429 --> 00:57:21.030
In a way that couldn't
be expressed into words.

1083
00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:24.000
The time. it seemed to
slow down to a stop.

1084
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.250
So. I drank it in.

1085
00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:39.730
Walking up to my apartment.
I began to realize something.

1086
00:57:39.730 --> 00:57:41.450
Hope. (sighs)

1087
00:57:43.515 --> 00:57:45.430
I fucking thought I smelled bacon.

1088
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:46.940
- Welcome home Mr. Soreno.

1089
00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:47.773
- [Lou] How'd you even--

1090
00:57:47.773 --> 00:57:48.942
- Hey you.

1091
00:57:48.942 --> 00:57:49.775
- Oh for fuck's sake.

1092
00:57:49.775 --> 00:57:50.608
- [Agent] I hope you don't mind.

1093
00:57:50.608 --> 00:57:51.490
I made myself a cup of coffee.

1094
00:57:51.490 --> 00:57:52.830
- [Agent] Oh and checked out your place.

1095
00:57:52.830 --> 00:57:54.230
- Do you have a permit for all those guns.

1096
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:55.880
- Do you have a permit for being a cunt?

1097
00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:57.280
- [Agent] Oh. well yes I do.

1098
00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:00.090
- [Lou] So what the fuck do you want?

1099
00:58:00.090 --> 00:58:02.830
- Oh. it's not to be jerked
off. I can tell you that.

1100
00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:05.140
I fucked around enough with you dumb lops.

1101
00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:07.230
- Oh. you're tired of
being a little bitch?

1102
00:58:07.230 --> 00:58:08.730
Don't be tearing up on me now.

1103
00:58:12.146 --> 00:58:14.010
If any of you think I'm
gonna flip on Mancini--

1104
00:58:14.010 --> 00:58:15.160
- [Agent] And Degorgio.

1105
00:58:16.038 --> 00:58:17.220
- (chuckles) Speaking of jerking off.

1106
00:58:17.220 --> 00:58:19.300
Is that why you brought her along?

1107
00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:21.270
Yeah. you with the dick
sucking lips back there.

1108
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:22.710
I bet you could cut the balls in a--

1109
00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:23.820
- Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

1110
00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:26.140
- Whoa honey. I was talking 'bout him.

1111
00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:26.973
- [Agent] Oh.

1112
00:58:26.973 --> 00:58:28.370
- Plus I can tell you know
your way around a cock

1113
00:58:28.370 --> 00:58:29.660
since you seem to have one.

1114
00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:31.510
- We know what you fellas
have been doing here.

1115
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:32.890
With the illegal gambling.

1116
00:58:32.890 --> 00:58:34.860
We've had our ears to the
ground for a while now.

1117
00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:37.040
but suddenly it went deaf.

1118
00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:38.320
You know anything about that?

1119
00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:41.530
- Ears to the ground. what are
you fucking Indians now too?

1120
00:58:41.530 --> 00:58:42.880
It's feathers. not dots.

1121
00:58:43.810 --> 00:58:46.240
Fuck you. you had an
informant in our crew.

1122
00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:47.640
You think we didn't know that?

1123
00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:48.810
- Oh didn't you?

1124
00:58:48.810 --> 00:58:50.545
- Look. I'm giving you an out here.

1125
00:58:50.545 --> 00:58:52.200
- If you don't start cooperating.

1126
00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:53.860
we're gonna have to
throw every book at you.

1127
00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:55.870
- Oh yeah. what about the "Bible"?

1128
00:58:55.870 --> 00:58:57.470
Pretty sacrilegious don't you think.

1129
00:58:57.470 --> 00:58:59.370
since the three of you
were sworn in on it.

1130
00:58:59.370 --> 00:59:01.310
- Well it's not like
you even read it anyway.

1131
00:59:01.310 --> 00:59:03.320
I'm sure your father would be proud.

1132
00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:05.150
- Okay. I think it's about time

1133
00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:06.750
you get the fuck outta my house.

1134
00:59:08.148 --> 00:59:09.563
And if you ever think I'm
gonna flip on the family.

1135
00:59:09.563 --> 00:59:11.613
you're as sorely mistaken as his asshole.

1136
00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:13.963
Or hers.

1137
00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:17.730
- Oh family. is that what you call 'em?

1138
00:59:17.730 --> 00:59:19.170
Well mine never gave my dad and brother

1139
00:59:19.170 --> 00:59:20.250
a Youngstown tune-up.

1140
00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:21.310
- [Lou] Excuse you?

1141
00:59:21.310 --> 00:59:22.310
- Yeah. you didn't know?

1142
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:24.020
Mancini's the one who put
a hit out on your pops.

1143
00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:25.300
- [Lou] What the fuck you say?

1144
00:59:26.290 --> 00:59:29.250
- Well. I wouldn't wanna be
serving a caretaker like that.

1145
00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:35.240
Yeah. we had evidence on the
hit he put out on your pop.

1146
00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:37.650
But. the box seems to have gone missing

1147
00:59:37.650 --> 00:59:39.200
due to corruption in the force.

1148
00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:43.880
Anyway. you have yourself a
good day there. Mr. Soreno.

1149
00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:45.250
- [Lou] It's Soreno.

1150
00:59:45.250 --> 00:59:46.980
- Oh. say hi to your ma for me.

1151
00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:49.150
And to that waitress. Wendy. too.

1152
00:59:49.150 --> 00:59:51.420
She's got a great ass!

1153
00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:53.401
When I see an ass like that. I don't know.

1154
00:59:53.401 --> 00:59:55.470
something comes outta me.

1155
00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:56.710
I fucking love Pacino.

1156
00:59:56.710 --> 00:59:58.650
- That was pretty close that time.

1157
00:59:58.650 --> 00:59:59.483
Bye-bye.

1158
01:00:00.798 --> 01:00:01.748
- I need a new job.

1159
01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.120
Shotgun.
- As if.

1160
01:00:07.298 --> 01:00:10.850
- The fucking prick with
the mind games. (scoffs)

1161
01:00:10.850 --> 01:00:12.350
No way he's telling the truth.

1162
01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:15.640
Nah. he just wants me to flip.

1163
01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:20.196
In fucking losing my edge.

1164
01:00:20.196 --> 01:00:24.472
I need to get some sleep.

1165
01:00:24.472 --> 01:00:26.972
(Lou sighing)

1166
01:00:29.290 --> 01:00:31.228
(intense banging)

1167
01:00:31.228 --> 01:00:36.228
In-fucking-credible.

1168
01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:40.290
Goddammit. who is it?

1169
01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:48.030
- Good fucking morning sunshine.

1170
01:00:48.030 --> 01:00:49.490
merry fucking Christmas.

1171
01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:51.910
Happy holidays. what's
with you locking the door

1172
01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:53.108
and not answering your phone?

1173
01:00:53.108 --> 01:00:54.437
- Ah.

1174
01:00:54.437 --> 01:00:56.000
- Ah. what are you gonna
do. lounge around all day

1175
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.800
in your underwear. get dressed.
Mancini wants to see us.

1176
01:01:01.210 --> 01:01:05.210
Oh. get dressed. Maggie's
waiting in the car.

1177
01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:06.060
- [Lou] What for?

1178
01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:08.377
- I don't know. he probably
wants to talk to us

1179
01:01:08.377 --> 01:01:09.860
about last night or something.

1180
01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:11.740
He wants us over for dinner.

1181
01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:12.720
- Ah. okay.

1182
01:01:14.955 --> 01:01:15.960
- What. did you have
a hooker banging party

1183
01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:16.793
in here last night?

1184
01:01:16.793 --> 01:01:19.870
Why do you always fucking look
like a slob. Jesus Christ?

1185
01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:21.530
- Yeah. it's a long fucking story.

1186
01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:22.980
Seems I'm never here anyways.

1187
01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.300
- Look at me. Romeo. you don't look good.

1188
01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:30.330
Those beautiful eyes of
yours. they're slacking.

1189
01:01:30.330 --> 01:01:33.200
You need some sleep and
we need to get you laid.

1190
01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:35.860
- Yeah. I'm working on it.

1191
01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:39.440
Let's fucking go.

1192
01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:40.273
- Get your heat.

1193
01:01:46.221 --> 01:01:48.470
- [Lou] Hey. let's grab a
bottle of something on our way.

1194
01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:49.390
- [Jeff] Yeah. I'll grab a two liter

1195
01:01:49.390 --> 01:01:50.358
bottle of soda. that's it.

1196
01:01:50.358 --> 01:01:52.941
(Lou laughing)

1197
01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:56.800
- Normally it's an honor being
served from the boss' table.

1198
01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:59.050
but tonight. it felt a little different.

1199
01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:02.560
Made me on edge after the
whole John DeFrange thing.

1200
01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:18.720
Oh. amazing meal Mrs.
Mancini. it was delicious.

1201
01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:20.070
- Yes. thank you ma'am.

1202
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.150
- Superb. I'm gonna have to get

1203
01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:22.870
the recipe from on on that dish.

1204
01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:26.050
- How 'bout right now.
it was my pleasure boys.

1205
01:02:26.050 --> 01:02:27.210
- [Vito] Thank you. honey.

1206
01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:28.640
- You're welcome.

1207
01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:31.510
Hey. Maggie and I are gonna
get desert ready for these two

1208
01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:35.335
and yours my dear. will be a little later.

1209
01:02:35.335 --> 01:02:38.770
- Ooh. (laughs) oh you
know exactly what I like.

1210
01:02:38.770 --> 01:02:40.020
- Yes I do.
- Don't you?

1211
01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:45.640
Sorry. just a bit of banter.

1212
01:02:47.470 --> 01:02:52.330
Anyway. I wanted to thank
you two for indulging

1213
01:02:52.330 --> 01:02:53.790
in my wishes last night.

1214
01:02:53.790 --> 01:02:54.930
- [Jeff] No problem. boss.

1215
01:02:54.930 --> 01:02:56.160
- Yeah boss. no problem.

1216
01:02:57.290 --> 01:02:58.690
- And I wanted to apologize.

1217
01:03:01.281 --> 01:03:03.131
for not letting you in the loop. Lou.

1218
01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:06.906
Yeah. I find it best if only one person

1219
01:03:06.906 --> 01:03:08.760
knows it's a hit.

1220
01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.210
- Thank you.

1221
01:03:10.210 --> 01:03:11.760
- It doesn't complicate things.

1222
01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:17.110
Especially if it's a
slippery snake like DeFrange.

1223
01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:20.950
You can never trust a rat.

1224
01:03:22.070 --> 01:03:23.470
His whole family are vermin.

1225
01:03:24.730 --> 01:03:26.000
Even his cousin David.

1226
01:03:31.070 --> 01:03:31.920
But I digress.

1227
01:03:33.270 --> 01:03:38.270
You two did real good. so good in fact.

1228
01:03:40.570 --> 01:03:45.000
management. both Cleveland and Pittsburgh

1229
01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:48.070
have decided to promote you.

1230
01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:50.330
- Promote?
- What?

1231
01:03:51.770 --> 01:03:54.190
- You two knuckleheads are
gonna be the first two made

1232
01:03:54.190 --> 01:03:56.070
in the last 12 years.

1233
01:03:56.070 --> 01:03:58.060
- That's fucking amazing.

1234
01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:00.540
- Mr. Mancini. we're honored. thank you.

1235
01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:03.350
- Don't thank me. you thank Paul Degorgio.

1236
01:04:03.350 --> 01:04:05.540
He's the one that approved the order.

1237
01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:09.690
- Lou. congratulations. congratulations.

1238
01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:15.600
- And you. young Jeffery.
better thank Francis Trimbou

1239
01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:17.170
when you see him on Friday.

1240
01:04:18.054 --> 01:04:19.550
It was his idea.

1241
01:04:19.550 --> 01:04:21.220
- What do you mean Friday?

1242
01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:24.400
- [Vito] That's when the
ceremony's gonna take place.

1243
01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.233
- Maggie!

1244
01:04:25.233 --> 01:04:26.066
(man laughing)

1245
01:04:26.066 --> 01:04:27.630
- [Maggie] What's going on baby?

1246
01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:29.630
- Lou and I are being made.

1247
01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:30.463
- [Maggie] What?

1248
01:04:30.463 --> 01:04:31.296
- Thanks Boss. thanks.

1249
01:04:31.296 --> 01:04:32.586
- [Maggie] Oh my god.

1250
01:04:32.586 --> 01:04:34.570
(soft piano music)

1251
01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:37.910
- Louis. I'm sorry your father
couldn't be here to see this.

1252
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:38.810
He was a good man.

1253
01:04:40.302 --> 01:04:42.210
- Yeah. yeah he was.

1254
01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:45.430
I really miss him.

1255
01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:47.080
- Yeah. he'd be proud. I know it.

1256
01:04:57.888 --> 01:05:00.388
- It's hard to tell what
could've. should've been.

1257
01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:04.624
but one things for sure.
Mancini really plays his cards

1258
01:05:04.624 --> 01:05:05.810
close to the chest.

1259
01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:48.636

01:05:48.636 --> 01:05:53.636

(upbeat music)

1273
01:07:31.736 --> 01:07:33.530
- I only heard stories
about this as a kid.

1274
01:07:33.530 --> 01:07:35.900
Never did I think I'd actually
get to be a part of it.

1275
01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:38.940
It was the highest honor to
be inducted as a wise guy.

1276
01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:40.610
Ceremony that dates back all the way

1277
01:07:40.610 --> 01:07:42.170
to the founders in Sicily.

1278
01:07:42.170 --> 01:07:43.620
Grand enough to befit a king.

1279
01:07:44.690 --> 01:07:46.800
With an almost spiritual undertone.

1280
01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:49.880
Unlike anything I've ever seen before.

1281
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:54.950
- We are gathered here
today to bear witness

1282
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:57.320
to the making of two new family members.

1283
01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:01.040
I feel like they're my own sons.

1284
01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:05.330
This is not a ritual we choose lightly.

1285
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:07.990
There has been many years

1286
01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:09.780
since a worthy soul has come forth.

1287
01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:15.950
Today my family. we have two righteous men

1288
01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:18.340
ready to take that pledge.

1289
01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:23.990
Louis Soreno and Jeffery Torin.

1290
01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:30.630
Both have seen much loss in
our senseless war for power.

1291
01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:36.110
Louis. with his father and his brother.

1292
01:08:37.390 --> 01:08:40.430
Jeffery. with his two older brothers.

1293
01:08:43.630 --> 01:08:47.990
Nothing is greater than a united front.

1294
01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:51.980
That's why both families are here today.

1295
01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:57.710
Paul and Francis. and their two knights.

1296
01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:04.320
Paul. please choose Lou's saint.

1297
01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:14.840
- [Lou] Paul Degorgio.
one of the most feared

1298
01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:17.620
higher ups in the New York crime family.

1299
01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:19.120
He was appointed at a young age top run

1300
01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:21.720
the Pittsburgh faction because
of his ruthless demeanor

1301
01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:23.040
and no nonsense attitude.

1302
01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:27.350
He once had his entire crew
killed and their families.

1303
01:09:27.350 --> 01:09:30.230
for not bringing back all
the money from a bank heist.

1304
01:09:30.230 --> 01:09:31.730
They say he's mellowed out with age.

1305
01:09:31.730 --> 01:09:33.480
but I wouldn't test him.

1306
01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:41.580
- Wisely chosen. St George.
the patron saint of courage.

1307
01:09:43.410 --> 01:09:47.780
He was in a battle between
good and evil. good won.

1308
01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:54.010
Frank. please choose Jeffery's saint.

1309
01:09:55.730 --> 01:09:58.285
- [Lou] Frank Trimbou. direct
connection of the Chicago

1310
01:09:58.285 --> 01:10:01.160
crime family through
the Cleveland faction.

1311
01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:03.122
He was responsible for
ordering dozens of car bombings

1312
01:10:03.122 --> 01:10:06.370
throughout Youngstown during
the feud between the families.

1313
01:10:06.370 --> 01:10:07.815
Motherfucker practically
coined the phrase.

1314
01:10:07.815 --> 01:10:10.950
Youngstown tune-up by himself.

1315
01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:13.200
This guy. he was a real son-of-a-bitch.

1316
01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:21.770
- St Thomas Becket. the
patron saint of wealth.

1317
01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:26.739
He rose to power and
riches. but was cut down

1318
01:10:26.739 --> 01:10:28.990
by the king's men before his time.

1319
01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:37.350
Paul. Frank. as a baby. you
were baptized by your parents

1320
01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:41.330
into the Catholic faith.

1321
01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:47.091
But today we baptize you
into the family by blood.

1322
01:10:47.091 --> 01:10:49.924
(Jeffery gasping)

1323
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:59.040
Paul. Frank. this drop of blood

1324
01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:01.060
symbolizes your birth into the family.

1325
01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:05.201
We are one until death.

1326
01:11:05.201 --> 01:11:07.951
(dramatic music)

1327
01:11:12.390 --> 01:11:17.110
This flame symbolizes your flesh.

1328
01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:23.140
As the saint burns. so will burn your soul

1329
01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.710
if you betray this family.

1330
01:11:27.890 --> 01:11:31.760
You enter here freely. but
only leave through death.

1331
01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:37.890
There are five rules that all
most follow in the family.

1332
01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:41.270
Number one. be loyal.

1333
01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:45.680
Number two. be rational.

1334
01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:49.960
Number three. be a man of honor.

1335
01:11:51.595 --> 01:11:55.400
Number four. be a stand out guy.

1336
01:11:57.270 --> 01:12:01.880
And finally number five. show some class

1337
01:12:03.370 --> 01:12:04.560
and be independent.

1338
01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:10.460
In front of you both
sits the gun and dagger.

1339
01:12:11.930 --> 01:12:14.210
These are yours to carry at all times.

1340
01:12:14.210 --> 01:12:17.980
You enter the family by gun and dagger.

1341
01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:21.900
you protect the family by gun and dagger.

1342
01:12:23.670 --> 01:12:28.000
you shall die by gun and dagger.

1343
01:12:30.650 --> 01:12:35.650
Lou. Jeffery. welcome to the family.

1344
01:12:36.610 --> 01:12:39.610
(everyone clapping)

1345
01:12:45.919 --> 01:12:47.240
(soft jazzy music)

1346
01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:50.930
- So Louie. how you enjoying
it here in Youngstown?

1347
01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:52.940
- Well you know things are--

1348
01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:56.090
- He's been working so
hard I hardly see him.

1349
01:12:56.090 --> 01:12:58.390
- [Paul] I'm sure his
father would be proud.

1350
01:12:58.390 --> 01:13:00.969
- No. actually he wouldn't.

1351
01:13:00.969 --> 01:13:04.000
What do have him doing exactly?

1352
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:04.850
- Ma. please.

1353
01:13:04.850 --> 01:13:06.810
- Oh. well what he needs is a good woman

1354
01:13:06.810 --> 01:13:07.643
to take care of him.

1355
01:13:07.643 --> 01:13:09.610
Lord knows he's lost without one.

1356
01:13:09.610 --> 01:13:12.630
All right. all right. I'll shut up.

1357
01:13:12.630 --> 01:13:14.840
- No. no. no. that's quite
all right. Mrs. Soreno.

1358
01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:17.530
I really appreciate
the inside information.

1359
01:13:17.530 --> 01:13:19.910
Otherwise I'd never hear anything at all.

1360
01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:24.910
Besides. like your husband.
every prince needs a princess.

1361
01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:29.970
But. not every king needs a queen.

1362
01:13:31.465 --> 01:13:32.820
At least in my opinion.

1363
01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:33.710
Continue please.

1364
01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:39.830
- Well. things have been.
they've been running smoothly.

1365
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:41.530
Except for a few loose
screws in the machine

1366
01:13:41.530 --> 01:13:43.180
that Mr. Mancini had us fix.

1367
01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:46.040
- Yeah. yeah. yeah.
yeah. I heard about that.

1368
01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:47.990
That's a good thing we caught it early.

1369
01:13:49.050 --> 01:13:50.150
So Lou. let me ask you something.

1370
01:13:50.150 --> 01:13:53.030
How do you feel the
operation is running now?

1371
01:13:54.138 --> 01:13:56.510
Do you feel that we're
getting you properly prepared

1372
01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:58.660
for future involvement?

1373
01:13:58.660 --> 01:14:00.180
- Yeah. yeah. I guess so.

1374
01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:01.820
- The reason I'm asking
is because New York's

1375
01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:04.280
been pushing harder for more involvement.

1376
01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:07.440
They feel the situation
needs to be a little more

1377
01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:09.000
equitable than it currently is.

1378
01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.510
while still giving Vito his
leash. of course for now.

1379
01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:17.856
(glass chiming)

1380
01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:24.840
- After speaking with my wife and Francis

1381
01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:29.600
over the past few months. we decided

1382
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:33.880
this would be a good time
to look into retirement.

1383
01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:39.030
I have been given control of this town

1384
01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:45.350
for nearly three decades. it's
time to give over the reigns

1385
01:14:45.624 --> 01:14:49.730
to a close personal family friend of ours.

1386
01:14:51.870 --> 01:14:56.292
I would like to announce my
successor. Jeffery Torin.

1387
01:14:56.292 --> 01:14:58.324
(everyone clapping)
(everyone cheering)

1388
01:14:58.324 --> 01:15:00.666
(Vito laughing)

1389
01:15:00.666 --> 01:15:01.962
Come here. come here.

1390
01:15:01.962 --> 01:15:04.043
- Hey. hey. hey that's
excuse me. excuse me.

1391
01:15:06.381 --> 01:15:10.298
(speaking in foreign language)

1392
01:15:11.490 --> 01:15:13.390
Francis. don't you guys think
you should've spoke to me

1393
01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:15.340
before making this little announcement?

1394
01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:20.520
- What do you mean Mr. Degorgio. huh?

1395
01:15:27.030 --> 01:15:29.940
- It was our original understanding

1396
01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:31.560
that a successor was to be named

1397
01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:34.020
by the person in charge at the time.

1398
01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:35.090
For he would best know

1399
01:15:35.090 --> 01:15:37.484
who was competent enough to take over.

1400
01:15:37.484 --> 01:15:40.430
- Oh. as you wish.

1401
01:15:47.010 --> 01:15:51.720
Mr. Torin. congratulations. I
wanna wish you all the luck.

1402
01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:02.581
- Thank you.

1403
01:16:02.581 --> 01:16:03.414
- Let's get the fuck outta here.

1404
01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:11.650
- Hey. you coming out tonight right?

1405
01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:14.500
- [Lou] Yeah. yeah. yeah. I guess so.

1406
01:16:16.429 --> 01:16:18.110
- What do you mean. you guess so?

1407
01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:19.480
What do you mean. and
don't make me order you.

1408
01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:21.299
- [Lou] Are you gonna play
that card already. come on now.

1409
01:16:21.299 --> 01:16:22.207
Come on.

1410
01:16:22.207 --> 01:16:23.040
(men laughing)

1411
01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:24.480
- I just want you to
come out and celebrate.

1412
01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:25.860
That's it. that's all I'm asking.

1413
01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:26.820
- Yeah. I know. I know.

1414
01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:28.537
I just gotta take her home
and I'll be out. okay?

1415
01:16:28.537 --> 01:16:30.370
- Hey Ms. Soreno. how are you?

1416
01:16:30.370 --> 01:16:32.350
I'll see you tonight. all right?

1417
01:16:32.350 --> 01:16:33.183
- Sounds good.

1418
01:16:34.350 --> 01:16:35.590
- Love you so much. thank you.

1419
01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:37.375
- [Lou] Hey. come here brother.

1420
01:16:37.375 --> 01:16:38.651
one more time for last night.

1421
01:16:38.651 --> 01:16:40.721
- I know. you deserved
it Lou. you deserved it.

1422
01:16:40.721 --> 01:16:44.301
- See you.

1423
01:16:44.301 --> 01:16:45.545
(thunder crackling)

1424
01:16:45.545 --> 01:16:46.378
It was supposed to be a day for me

1425
01:16:46.378 --> 01:16:47.580
to have a go down in
the book of the family

1426
01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:49.160
dating all the way back to Sicily.

1427
01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:51.440
but honestly. it felt like I was

1428
01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:53.520
an even bigger social outcast.

1429
01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:54.930
I could feel the tension in the family

1430
01:16:54.930 --> 01:16:56.530
brewing even deeper than before.

1431
01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:04.530
Now he was planning to
make a move. but what?

1432
01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:07.175
Now he certainly had that look.

1433
01:17:07.175 --> 01:17:10.560
The kinda look of a man that
you knew you couldn't trust.

1434
01:17:12.778 --> 01:17:15.361
(upbeat music)

1435
01:17:40.111 --> 01:17:40.944
Nope.

1436
01:17:42.807 --> 01:17:44.390
- [Man] Ooh. funny.

1437
01:17:45.730 --> 01:17:48.310
- [Jeff] Stop. love you.

1438
01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:52.620
- [Damn] Damn. here you go Jeff.

1439
01:17:52.620 --> 01:17:53.909
- [Jeff] Thank you. Lou.

1440
01:17:53.909 --> 01:17:54.742
- [Lou] It's a double.

1441
01:17:54.742 --> 01:17:55.575
- Thank you. Lou.

1442
01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:59.170
Lou. your pops would be
so proud of you brother.

1443
01:17:59.170 --> 01:18:01.110
You really made something of yourself.

1444
01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:02.800
- Hey. your brothers would be too. pal.

1445
01:18:03.770 --> 01:18:05.170
We've really come a long way.

1446
01:18:05.170 --> 01:18:06.003
- Yes we have.

1447
01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:08.500
You know. I wish my pops were around

1448
01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:09.500
right about now too.

1449
01:18:10.350 --> 01:18:12.430
So I could bash his
fucking skull in myself.

1450
01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:14.180
He put my mom through so much shit.

1451
01:18:15.030 --> 01:18:16.680
- [Lou] Hey. I'm sorry 'bout that. bro.

1452
01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:17.780
And your brothers too.

1453
01:18:19.710 --> 01:18:23.413
- Don't be. we got each other now.

1454
01:18:23.413 --> 01:18:24.246
- [Men] Whoo!

1455
01:18:24.246 --> 01:18:26.270
- And this beautiful
chick on stage right now.

1456
01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:27.871
- [Man] Whoo. yeah!

1457
01:18:27.871 --> 01:18:30.168
(men catcalling)

1458
01:18:30.168 --> 01:18:31.480
- [Jeff] Oh my god. get over here.

1459
01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:33.893
This chick.

1460
01:18:35.422 --> 01:18:36.750
Lou. did you see that fucking move?

1461
01:18:40.141 --> 01:18:42.500
Oh my god. look at these
titties. I love you.

1462
01:18:45.203 --> 01:18:46.790
Now why the fuck can't Maggie do that?

1463
01:18:47.850 --> 01:18:50.183
Do that and I'll be home on
my hands and knees every night

1464
01:18:50.183 --> 01:18:53.000
begging for fucking (yelling). whoo!

1465
01:18:55.230 --> 01:18:57.780
- [Both] Ass like a 10 year old boy.

1466
01:18:57.780 --> 01:18:58.613
- [Jeff] Whoo!

1467
01:18:59.590 --> 01:19:00.600
- Gotta love Bill Paxton.

1468
01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:01.689
- [Jeff] He's in everything.

1469
01:19:01.689 --> 01:19:03.830
(Lou laughing)

1470
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:07.350
- Hey. so speaking about Maggie.

1471
01:19:08.477 --> 01:19:10.190
how's she been?

1472
01:19:10.190 --> 01:19:12.420
See seemed kinda pissed off
at the ceremony this morning.

1473
01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:14.140
- Yeah. she was giving
me some line of bullshit

1474
01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:16.260
like she didn't feel like going.

1475
01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:17.630
Even went as far as puking this morning.

1476
01:19:17.630 --> 01:19:18.830
act like she was sick.

1477
01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:19.663
- What?

1478
01:19:21.210 --> 01:19:23.200
- Fucking pissed about something.

1479
01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:24.250
Such a grudge holder.

1480
01:19:25.130 --> 01:19:27.430
Gives me the shit about
the formal family bullshit.

1481
01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:28.480
she hates that stuff.

1482
01:19:29.970 --> 01:19:32.700
Like how Diane practically
eye fucks the shit outta Vito

1483
01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:33.850
every waking second.

1484
01:19:33.850 --> 01:19:35.960
- [Lou] Yeah. you notice that too?

1485
01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:37.010
- Speak of the devil.

1486
01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:40.630
How Vito lucked into that.
I'll never fucking know.

1487
01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:42.953
Boss.

1488
01:19:44.650 --> 01:19:49.540
- Lou. Jeff. what are
you doing down here Jeff?

1489
01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:54.700
- I was just. celebrating huh. I guess.

1490
01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:57.720
- You can't celebrate down here. Jeff.

1491
01:20:08.110 --> 01:20:10.840
These lovely ladies
are gonna help you out.

1492
01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:12.090
- Thank you. Mr. Mancini.

1493
01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:16.980
- We'll take good care of him.

1494
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.130
- I bet you will.

1495
01:20:20.130 --> 01:20:22.560
- [Jeff] Am I. oh shit. be right back.

1496
01:20:25.129 --> 01:20:28.129
(upbeat rock music)

1497
01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:37.333
Shit!

1498
01:20:41.859 --> 01:20:43.640
(laughs) Holy shit!

1499
01:20:49.068 --> 01:20:51.810
- Hey. hey. hey. you're
next. you know. (laughs)

1500
01:20:51.810 --> 01:20:53.370
- Ooh. can I help?

1501
01:20:54.510 --> 01:20:56.980
- Oh baby. anything you want.

1502
01:20:56.980 --> 01:21:00.550
- I wanna give him
something to remember me by.

1503
01:21:01.930 --> 01:21:05.880
- Ooh. oh she's calling in begging.

1504
01:21:08.530 --> 01:21:09.880
- Hey. I really can't Vito.

1505
01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:13.500
- Yeah the fuck you can.

1506
01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:16.840
And that's till mister to you. you prick.

1507
01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:19.790
Just because you're made now.

1508
01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:21.740
doesn't mean you get to disobey orders.

1509
01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:25.940
- I'm sorry. Mr. Mancini.

1510
01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:29.330
- I bet you are. but you
need to apologize to Diane.

1511
01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:32.510
- Mrs. Mancini. I'm sorry.

1512
01:21:32.510 --> 01:21:34.330
- That's okay. really.

1513
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:38.793
- It's just. I recently found someone

1514
01:21:38.793 --> 01:21:41.350
that I really connect with her.

1515
01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:44.390
- [Diane] That's so cute.

1516
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:46.970
- She ain't here right now. okay.

1517
01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:50.400
Don't start acting like your father

1518
01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:52.200
and being all higher than thou art.

1519
01:21:54.380 --> 01:21:55.290
You're one of us.

1520
01:22:09.702 --> 01:22:11.441
- [Lou] I'll be right back.

1521
01:22:11.441 --> 01:22:12.370
Gonna get some fresh air.

1522
01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:16.670
- [Vito] Oh well. you
better hurry on back.

1523
01:22:17.959 --> 01:22:20.570
I don't know how long I can contain

1524
01:22:20.570 --> 01:22:23.890
this sexual firecracker on top of me.

1525
01:22:25.262 --> 01:22:28.095
(Jeff vocalizing)

1526
01:22:29.014 --> 01:22:30.030
- Do you like that. Daddy?

1527
01:22:30.030 --> 01:22:30.980
- I love it. Mommy.

1528
01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:33.970
Lou. look at me now. baby!

1529
01:22:33.970 --> 01:22:35.510
Look at me now. Louie!

1530
01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:38.750
I'm the boss. I'm the boss. whoo!

1531
01:22:48.577 --> 01:22:49.910
- Oh. I'm sorry.

1532
01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:51.424
- That's okay.

1533
01:22:51.424 --> 01:22:52.440
- I just didn't see you there.

1534
01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:56.470
Do you need a light?

1535
01:22:57.620 --> 01:22:58.740
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1536
01:22:58.740 --> 01:22:59.573
- [Lou] Thank you.

1537
01:23:01.230 --> 01:23:02.780
- So word is. you've been made.

1538
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:07.880
- Yeah. it's no big deal.

1539
01:23:09.210 --> 01:23:11.920
- What's poking through those
pants seems to beg to differ.

1540
01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:16.690
Anyways. my boss tells me
I need to make this night

1541
01:23:16.690 --> 01:23:17.740
special for you guys.

1542
01:23:19.050 --> 01:23:19.883
- Oh yeah?

1543
01:23:19.883 --> 01:23:24.600
- Yeah. does Mr. Soreno
wanna come out and play?

1544
01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:27.840
- Oh babe. thank you. but I can't.

1545
01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:30.070
- Oh sure you can. Big Time.

1546
01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:35.850
Well. she's a lucky. lucky girl then.

1547
01:23:35.850 --> 01:23:37.230
- Who?

1548
01:23:37.230 --> 01:23:38.680
- You know who.

1549
01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:39.640
Most guys don't give a shit

1550
01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:41.850
about their wives or
girlfriends that come in here.

1551
01:23:44.090 --> 01:23:47.510
Well. since you're not
made. I'll take the lighter.

1552
01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:52.970
- [Lou] Hey. how do you
know I'm not single.

1553
01:23:52.970 --> 01:23:55.780
- Because most single men
can't refuse my touch.

1554
01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:57.380
You should go see her.

1555
01:23:57.380 --> 01:23:59.220
Good guys like you
shouldn't be here anyway.

1556
01:24:00.330 --> 01:24:01.163
- Hey. thanks.

1557
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:09.370
It's about time I made a change
in my life. for the better.

1558
01:24:26.290 --> 01:24:27.140
There she is.

1559
01:24:28.899 --> 01:24:30.383
(sighs) A wave of relief hits me

1560
01:24:30.383 --> 01:24:32.480
when she recognizes my mug.

1561
01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:35.673
Oh man.

1562
01:24:37.594 --> 01:24:39.620
- I didn't expect to see you here so soon.

1563
01:24:39.620 --> 01:24:44.070
- Yeah. it's been a little hectic. sorry.

1564
01:24:45.210 --> 01:24:46.080
- Sorry.

1565
01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:49.024
- It's okay. it's better
that I'm now here with you.

1566
01:24:49.024 --> 01:24:51.362
- (chuckles) I thought
you were on the outs.

1567
01:24:51.362 --> 01:24:55.460
- Yeah. that's a little complicated now.

1568
01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:56.888
- Complicated.

1569
01:24:56.888 --> 01:24:57.721
- Well I mean.

1570
01:24:58.738 --> 01:25:01.038
- Oh my god. like what
happened to your hands?

1571
01:25:02.230 --> 01:25:03.520
- It's a family ritual.

1572
01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:06.467
- [Wendy] It's more like demonic.

1573
01:25:06.467 --> 01:25:07.580
- Oh no.

1574
01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:08.710
- Really. just cover it.

1575
01:25:08.710 --> 01:25:09.770
I don't want to look at it.

1576
01:25:09.770 --> 01:25:10.603
- Fine.

1577
01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:15.493
Thank you.

1578
01:25:17.550 --> 01:25:19.650
- So you really enjoy working for the mob?

1579
01:25:20.916 --> 01:25:22.115
- Well...

1580
01:25:22.115 --> 01:25:23.210
- You think I'm that stupid?

1581
01:25:24.057 --> 01:25:25.360
- I mean I couldn't tell you.

1582
01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:27.510
- You are. I mean the way
you guys walked around

1583
01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:30.640
this place in your fancy
suits. the late nights.

1584
01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:32.100
and the owner seemed to only be scared

1585
01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:33.700
when the two of you were around.

1586
01:25:35.050 --> 01:25:36.720
- He doesn't have anything
to be scared about.

1587
01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:38.560
He pays for protection.

1588
01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:39.860
- Protection from what?

1589
01:25:47.608 --> 01:25:49.709
What was that for?

1590
01:25:49.709 --> 01:25:51.220
- For fixing my hand.

1591
01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:53.140
Plus I like you. Wendy. a lot.

1592
01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:57.720
I've been wanting to kiss
you since the waterfall.

1593
01:25:57.720 --> 01:25:58.820
- Well why didn't you?

1594
01:25:59.836 --> 01:26:01.350
- I don't know. I was scared.

1595
01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:05.600
I've never met anyone like you.
plus you look sexy as hell.

1596
01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:07.810
- I thought I'd find you here.

1597
01:26:07.810 --> 01:26:09.240
- Not now. dickhead.

1598
01:26:12.292 --> 01:26:14.042
If I throw a stick. will you leave?

1599
01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:17.520
- Why are you here.
you're missing all the fun

1600
01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:19.820
with the fam down at the nudy club.

1601
01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:21.090
- [Lou] Don't you two
vampires have someone

1602
01:26:21.090 --> 01:26:22.240
else's leg to hum?

1603
01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:26.050
- Ooh. better watch out
Charles. he's a wise guy now.

1604
01:26:26.050 --> 01:26:28.845
- Ooh. he's got me quaking in my boots.

1605
01:26:28.845 --> 01:26:29.870
(agents laughing)

1606
01:26:29.870 --> 01:26:32.680
- [Lou] Look asshole. I've
had about enough of your...

1607
01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:38.400
- [Agent] Where the hell
did this gorilla come from?

1608
01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:40.280
- [Agent] Yeah actually
the zoo just called

1609
01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:41.690
and you're due back by nine.

1610
01:26:42.695 --> 01:26:43.680
(upbeat music)

1611
01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:45.371
- Well who the fuck are you?

1612
01:26:45.371 --> 01:26:48.130
We were having a conversation
here before you barged in.

1613
01:26:48.130 --> 01:26:49.456
- I gotta go. Wendy.

1614
01:26:49.456 --> 01:26:51.140
- Wait Lou. where are you going?

1615
01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:51.973
- I'm sorry.

1616
01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:59.510
- [Agent] Yeah okay. well
nice talking to you drago.

1617
01:27:00.530 --> 01:27:02.230
- They're on your ass now boy.

1618
01:27:03.454 --> 01:27:04.700
(agents laughing)

1619
01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:08.160
Can I get two coffees over here?

1620
01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:09.210
- Normally a car ride somewhere

1621
01:27:09.210 --> 01:27:10.380
with two members of the family.

1622
01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:12.630
I say I have a 95% chance of coming back.

1623
01:27:12.630 --> 01:27:15.780
But with the feds there. it's 50/50.

1624
01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:18.280
You gotta go where you're
told when Degorgio asks.

1625
01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:56.341
My mom and dad used to live in Pittsburgh.

1626
01:28:56.341 --> 01:28:59.529
They had a house up in Troy Hill.

1627
01:28:59.529 --> 01:29:03.107
Man. I wonder if it's even still standing.

1628
01:29:03.107 --> 01:29:05.331
But a lot has changed since then.

1629
01:29:05.331 --> 01:29:08.471
and a lot'll continue to change.

1630
01:29:08.471 --> 01:29:11.804
The dismal tide that washes over us all.

1631
01:29:40.199 --> 01:29:42.616
- [Paul] Immaculate isn't it?

1632
01:29:46.749 --> 01:29:48.332
- Yes. it truly is.

1633
01:29:52.468 --> 01:29:55.281
- I mean this could all be yours one day

1634
01:29:55.281 --> 01:29:57.670
if things continue like
they are in New York.

1635
01:29:57.670 --> 01:30:01.736
But for now you've got
Youngstown to deal with.

1636
01:30:01.736 --> 01:30:03.783
- [Lou] What do you mean. sir?

1637
01:30:03.783 --> 01:30:07.300
- I just got off the
phone with management.

1638
01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:09.449
and they're flying me in
to discuss the future.

1639
01:30:09.449 --> 01:30:11.489
It's even necessary you take
charge before we lose it again

1640
01:30:11.489 --> 01:30:13.489
for another few decades.

1641
01:30:16.156 --> 01:30:18.608
- Well Mancini already
named his successor.

1642
01:30:18.608 --> 01:30:21.691
- [Paul] Yeah. without our blessings.

1643
01:30:23.961 --> 01:30:24.794
- [Lou] But how are we--

1644
01:30:24.794 --> 01:30:27.380
- Okay. no need to concern
yourself with that. okay?

1645
01:30:27.380 --> 01:30:30.750
We want to be the first to let
you know. no more surprises.

1646
01:30:34.870 --> 01:30:37.477
- Thank you Mr. Degorgio.

1647
01:30:37.477 --> 01:30:39.770
- Don't be too thrilled. huh kid.

1648
01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:46.150
- I am. just a shock.

1649
01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:50.810
Does Jeff know about this yet?

1650
01:30:52.140 --> 01:30:54.780
- There's no need to concern
yourself with Jeff. okay?

1651
01:30:54.780 --> 01:30:58.020
He'll be asked to step
down. it's just politics.

1652
01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:00.970
- But what if he doesn't?

1653
01:31:02.496 --> 01:31:07.496
- (scoffs) Oh yeah. he will.

1654
01:31:13.190 --> 01:31:15.280
- Mr. Degorgio. Jeff's my friend.

1655
01:31:16.300 --> 01:31:17.802
He's been my friend my entire life.

1656
01:31:17.802 --> 01:31:21.570
- Louie. you need to
think about your future.

1657
01:31:21.570 --> 01:31:24.400
Okay. every action has a consequence.

1658
01:31:25.370 --> 01:31:27.550
Every wise guy knows this. every.

1659
01:31:30.290 --> 01:31:34.230
Let's say that somebody was
to intervene in my plans.

1660
01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:37.950
well I might not be able to protect them

1661
01:31:37.950 --> 01:31:39.410
or their loved ones.

1662
01:31:39.410 --> 01:31:44.230
Now I don't like it. but it's
the cost of doing business.

1663
01:31:51.290 --> 01:31:54.020
- Well you won't find me
standing in your way. sir.

1664
01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:58.670
- Good. why don't we go get a drink?

1665
01:31:59.730 --> 01:32:02.120
I'd like to hash a couple
of things over with you.

1666
01:32:03.540 --> 01:32:04.373
- Okay.

1667
01:32:09.645 --> 01:32:12.562
(soft jazzy music)

1668
01:32:15.130 --> 01:32:18.620
Then we usually take the case over to Vic.

1669
01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:20.630
he's the one that sends it on out.

1670
01:32:20.630 --> 01:32:23.390
That's pretty much how Mancini
has us run collections.

1671
01:32:23.390 --> 01:32:27.380
- I see. I'll have Marco here
swing by and pick you up.

1672
01:32:27.380 --> 01:32:28.630
run you through the new process.

1673
01:32:28.630 --> 01:32:30.906
It's much more efficient.

1674
01:32:30.906 --> 01:32:34.187
- Thank you.

1675
01:32:34.187 --> 01:32:35.020
Ooh.

1676
01:32:40.890 --> 01:32:45.810
- So. my sources tell me

1677
01:32:48.460 --> 01:32:49.680
that you've been having some trouble

1678
01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:51.720
with the feds around town lately.

1679
01:32:54.660 --> 01:32:55.493
Is that true?

1680
01:32:58.090 --> 01:33:02.490
- Well yeah. they are pretty persistent.

1681
01:33:04.450 --> 01:33:07.190
But I haven't told 'em a thing.

1682
01:33:07.190 --> 01:33:10.520
- Don't worry 'bout that.
you're third generation capos.

1683
01:33:12.070 --> 01:33:15.450
Consider that situation taken care of.

1684
01:33:15.450 --> 01:33:16.980
- We don't need somebody snooping around.

1685
01:33:16.980 --> 01:33:20.190
sticking their big nose
where it don't belong.

1686
01:33:20.190 --> 01:33:25.190
Especially the new boss in town.

1687
01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:28.560
- [Lou] I noticed how the
feds were off putting.

1688
01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:35.440
- In this case New York is
gonna make an exception.

1689
01:33:35.510 --> 01:33:37.480
Hey Louie. let me ask you something.

1690
01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:42.750
You got a girlfriend or a
fiance or something like that.

1691
01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:44.640
that I don't know about?

1692
01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:47.400
I mean these things can be a distraction.

1693
01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:49.513
- No. sir.

1694
01:33:53.070 --> 01:33:54.920
- Good. just checking.

1695
01:33:58.100 --> 01:34:01.080
- Well you know. I mean nobody consistent.

1696
01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:04.620
- [Marco] Yeah. I bet
you don't. lover boy.

1697
01:34:05.825 --> 01:34:07.520
- Why don't you like the adults talk.

1698
01:34:09.330 --> 01:34:12.346
It's best to keep your love
life out of this business.

1699
01:34:12.346 --> 01:34:14.220
- [Marco] Yeah. you don't
wanna let the broads

1700
01:34:14.220 --> 01:34:15.720
get you all twisted up inside.

1701
01:34:17.570 --> 01:34:22.123
Mr. Degorgio. sir with all due respect.

1702
01:34:22.123 --> 01:34:23.490
won't don't you tell Mr. Soreno here.

1703
01:34:23.490 --> 01:34:25.820
why. why you didn't get married.

1704
01:34:27.075 --> 01:34:30.230
(glass banging)

1705
01:34:30.230 --> 01:34:31.780
- Was I fucking talking to you?

1706
01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:33.580
Was I talking to you?

1707
01:34:33.580 --> 01:34:34.413
- No. but I was talking--

1708
01:34:34.413 --> 01:34:35.450
- Well then shut the fuck up.

1709
01:34:35.450 --> 01:34:37.600
Go sit at the fucking
kids table right now.

1710
01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:40.610
Stupid fucking idiot. get outta here.

1711
01:34:42.580 --> 01:34:45.895
Hey Lou. you don't mind
if I call you Lou. do you?

1712
01:34:45.895 --> 01:34:48.460
Let me tall you a little
something about the broads. okay?

1713
01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:52.000
You get involved with
'em. everything's good.

1714
01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.450
then next thing you know.

1715
01:34:53.450 --> 01:34:55.460
they take you for
everything you fucking got.

1716
01:34:55.460 --> 01:34:57.420
Everything. they leave you with nothing.

1717
01:34:57.420 --> 01:34:58.920
And I've fucking seen it. I...

1718
01:35:01.637 --> 01:35:06.637
(laughs) Yeah. I know. yeah.

1719
01:35:08.184 --> 01:35:10.104
Lighten up kid. you'll
have your time in the sun

1720
01:35:10.104 --> 01:35:15.104
with no pesky interruptions.

1721
01:35:15.431 --> 01:35:20.431
- Thank you. Mr. Degorgio. thank you.

1722
01:35:20.530 --> 01:35:24.206
- Sure thing kid.

1723
01:35:24.206 --> 01:35:27.550
Yeah. yeah. yeah. where you going?

1724
01:35:27.550 --> 01:35:30.037
- I gotta hit the head.

1725
01:35:30.037 --> 01:35:35.037
I'll be back. sir.

1726
01:35:53.308 --> 01:35:58.308
- Fuck.

1727
01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:21.080
- [Valet] Yo. hey!

1728
01:36:29.762 --> 01:36:32.345
(upbeat music)

1729
01:36:35.603 --> 01:36:38.663
- [Jeff] I'm the fucking king
now. I'm the fucking boss.

1730
01:36:38.663 --> 01:36:40.540
You're the boss. I'm the second boss.

1731
01:36:40.540 --> 01:36:43.457
(mancini laughing)

1732
01:37:11.736 --> 01:37:14.569
(tires squealing)

1733
01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:21.073
- Where's Jeff?

1734
01:37:22.700 --> 01:37:23.533
You?

1735
01:37:25.428 --> 01:37:27.450
- You're back. told you. you
couldn't resist my touch.

1736
01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:31.216
- Don't flatter yourself. where's Jeff?

1737
01:37:31.216 --> 01:37:33.200
- Listen. I'm paying for this. buddy.

1738
01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:37.890
- Jesus Louie. this a paying customer.

1739
01:37:37.890 --> 01:37:38.723
- Fuck him.

1740
01:37:39.610 --> 01:37:40.880
Where is he?

1741
01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:42.601
- I don't know. he left
with the older man.

1742
01:37:42.601 --> 01:37:47.046
with the girl in the red dress.

1743
01:37:47.046 --> 01:37:47.977
Hey. he said something about

1744
01:37:47.977 --> 01:37:52.977
taking the party back to his place.

1745
01:38:07.990 --> 01:38:10.492
- [Vito] It's good to be back
in our neck of the woods.

1746
01:38:10.492 --> 01:38:12.590
- Surely. I'm exhausted.

1747
01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:16.790
- Not yet you're not.

1748
01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:19.680
In all seriousness you need
to go home to your wife.

1749
01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:22.090
- Flowers and chocolates
would be a nice touch.

1750
01:38:22.090 --> 01:38:24.330
- Show here you care about her tonight.

1751
01:38:24.330 --> 01:38:27.820
Fun and games are over.
Jeff. school's out.

1752
01:38:51.818 --> 01:38:54.090
You'll find having a
strong woman beside you

1753
01:38:54.090 --> 01:38:56.560
helps ease your mind. keep your cool.

1754
01:38:57.510 --> 01:38:58.460
now more than ever.

1755
01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:04.600
Now. go home and fuck your wife.

1756
01:39:06.150 --> 01:39:07.500
It'll do you a lot of good.

1757
01:39:13.194 --> 01:39:15.119
- What are you gonna do. Mr. Mancini?

1758
01:39:15.119 --> 01:39:19.664
- Oh me. if she can
hear me coming already.

1759
01:39:19.664 --> 01:39:21.570
(Vito groaning)

1760
01:39:21.570 --> 01:39:23.898
(men laughing)

1761
01:39:23.898 --> 01:39:25.499
- Have fun Mr. Mancini.

1762
01:39:25.499 --> 01:39:27.249
Vito. have fun. Vito.

1763
01:39:28.588 --> 01:39:31.300
- All right. see ya.

1764
01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:35.550
Well. where's my pussy?

1765
01:39:38.550 --> 01:39:39.540
Where's my pussy?

1766
01:40:20.008 --> 01:40:21.091
- [Lou] Fuck.

1767
01:40:30.441 --> 01:40:31.822
- [Vito] You're not gonna take my wife.

1768
01:40:31.822 --> 01:40:33.381
(gun banging)

1769
01:40:33.381 --> 01:40:34.578
You son-of-a-bitch!

1770
01:40:34.578 --> 01:40:35.504
(gun banging)

1771
01:40:35.504 --> 01:40:38.184
- [Lou] Mr. Mancini. it's me Lou.

1772
01:40:38.184 --> 01:40:39.031
- [Vito] Lou!

1773
01:40:39.031 --> 01:40:40.914
- [Lou] Yeah!

1774
01:40:40.914 --> 01:40:45.407
- [Vito] Help me get
Diane out. she been shot.

1775
01:40:45.407 --> 01:40:48.407
Louie. come on. help me get her out.

1776
01:40:49.529 --> 01:40:51.105
- [Lou] Oh fuck.

1777
01:40:51.105 --> 01:40:52.090
- [Vito] She been shot.

1778
01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:56.650
Oh no. no. no. oh my poor sweet Diane.

1779
01:41:01.006 --> 01:41:03.256
Oh. who did this. oh Diane.

1780
01:41:04.980 --> 01:41:05.813
- What happened?

1781
01:41:08.283 --> 01:41:09.790
- That prick. Degorgio.

1782
01:41:09.790 --> 01:41:11.690
He sent that fuck to finish us off.

1783
01:41:13.220 --> 01:41:14.350
He wants control.

1784
01:41:15.484 --> 01:41:17.240
- Come on. let me help you up.

1785
01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:18.240
- [Vito] No. no. no.

1786
01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:20.750
I'm pretty well bugged.

1787
01:41:21.850 --> 01:41:22.980
- Mr. Mancini. don't say that.

1788
01:41:22.980 --> 01:41:24.890
Come on. the ambulance is coming.

1789
01:41:24.890 --> 01:41:27.980
- No don't fucking call
'em. don't call 'em.

1790
01:41:27.980 --> 01:41:29.480
I don't deserve their respect.

1791
01:41:30.346 --> 01:41:31.300
- What?

1792
01:41:32.370 --> 01:41:35.350
- Louie. Louie there's
something I need to tell you.

1793
01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:38.680
- [Louie] That can wait. come on.

1794
01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:40.680
- No you need to know. you need to know.

1795
01:41:44.410 --> 01:41:49.410
20 years ago. I followed orders
to have your dad taken out.

1796
01:41:52.128 --> 01:41:53.860
(suspenseful music)

1797
01:41:53.860 --> 01:41:54.860
- What. no.

1798
01:42:00.090 --> 01:42:02.540
So it's. it's true?

1799
01:42:04.037 --> 01:42:05.020
- Yeah.
- No.

1800
01:42:09.970 --> 01:42:11.720
- Your dad and I were friends. Lou.

1801
01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:14.500
He stepped on too many toes.

1802
01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:21.230
I lived with that anguish
since that night. Lou.

1803
01:42:22.270 --> 01:42:24.600
I tried to pay back what
I could and reconcile

1804
01:42:26.082 --> 01:42:27.032
to you and your Ma.

1805
01:42:30.180 --> 01:42:34.570
But a debt like that
could never be repaid.

1806
01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:37.830
Forgive me. son.

1807
01:42:41.180 --> 01:42:42.013
Forgive me.

1808
01:42:45.009 --> 01:42:46.500
- Don't you fucking call me son.

1809
01:42:48.188 --> 01:42:49.400
I fucking looked up to you.

1810
01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:53.480
- Do me one final justice.

1811
01:42:56.660 --> 01:42:58.010
I can't live without Diane.

1812
01:42:59.220 --> 01:43:00.940
No. I can't live without her.

1813
01:43:02.970 --> 01:43:06.257
I want you to shoot me. shoot me Lou.

1814
01:43:17.340 --> 01:43:18.173
Do it!

1815
01:43:22.260 --> 01:43:23.093
- No.

1816
01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:29.440
- Do it!

1817
01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:33.227
Do it. don't e a fucking
pussy like your father!

1818
01:43:34.795 --> 01:43:36.610
- Fine!
(gun banging)

1819
01:43:36.610 --> 01:43:41.350
- Shit. shit. you shot
me in the fucking leg!

1820
01:43:42.185 --> 01:43:43.310
- You wanted me to shoot you.

1821
01:43:43.310 --> 01:43:45.135
- [Vito] Not in the fucking leg!

1822
01:43:45.135 --> 01:43:47.021
- You worthless fucking coward.

1823
01:43:47.021 --> 01:43:48.740
You motherfucker. if I would have shot you

1824
01:43:48.740 --> 01:43:51.055
in that fucked up. corrupt brain of yours.

1825
01:43:51.055 --> 01:43:52.126
you never would have been able to live

1826
01:43:52.126 --> 01:43:55.913
for the fucked up shit
you don't to everybody.

1827
01:43:55.913 --> 01:43:58.593
- Yeah. I gave you every reason.

1828
01:43:58.593 --> 01:44:01.530
End me now. Lou.

1829
01:44:01.530 --> 01:44:04.148
So why. Lou?

1830
01:44:04.148 --> 01:44:09.148
Louie. Louie!

1831
01:44:09.575 --> 01:44:14.225
Louie. please.

1832
01:44:14.225 --> 01:44:17.182
Louie. Lou!

1833
01:44:17.182 --> 01:44:19.932
(dramatic music)

1834
01:44:40.706 --> 01:44:41.837
(sirens wailing)

1835
01:44:41.837 --> 01:44:46.837
- [Louis] Oh fuck. Jeff. oh fuck.

1836
01:45:18.925 --> 01:45:19.790
- [Jeff] How are you?

1837
01:45:19.790 --> 01:45:22.060
- [Clerk] Good. so who's the lucky lady?

1838
01:45:22.060 --> 01:45:23.760
- My wife. it's a surprise.

1839
01:45:25.327 --> 01:45:27.250
What do you got here?

1840
01:45:27.250 --> 01:45:29.000
- [Clerk] Um. how 'bout these ones?

1841
01:45:31.010 --> 01:45:32.930
- If you say so. let me smell 'em.

1842
01:45:33.910 --> 01:45:35.730
Ah. these are definitely to die for.

1843
01:45:37.730 --> 01:45:40.580
You know what. keep the change.

1844
01:45:40.580 --> 01:45:42.320
- [Clerk] Thank you.

1845
01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:43.570
Good luck with your wife.

1846
01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:46.193
- Thank you.

1847
01:45:47.090 --> 01:45:47.990
- [Clerk] Good night.

1848
01:46:16.907 --> 01:46:19.657
(dramatic music)

1849
01:46:24.657 --> 01:46:27.240
(Jeff humming)

1850
01:46:51.047 --> 01:46:53.272
- [Maggie] It's about time you got home.

1851
01:46:53.272 --> 01:46:54.560
- You must be feeling better honey bunny.

1852
01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:55.680
You're still up. eh.

1853
01:46:56.970 --> 01:47:01.510
- Turns out. I'm not even sick. Daddy.

1854
01:47:03.110 --> 01:47:05.710
- [Jeff] You're fucking kidding me.

1855
01:47:05.710 --> 01:47:06.543
- No.

1856
01:47:06.543 --> 01:47:08.214
- Oh my god!

1857
01:47:08.214 --> 01:47:09.209
(gun banging)

1858
01:47:09.209 --> 01:47:12.126
(Maggie screaming)

1859
01:47:13.367 --> 01:47:15.867
(gun banging)

1860
01:47:23.299 --> 01:47:25.966
(clock ticking)

1861
01:47:34.915 --> 01:47:36.915
- Maggie. call for help.

1862
01:47:38.162 --> 01:47:40.478
It's all right. brother.
help is on the way.

1863
01:47:40.478 --> 01:47:43.145
(Jeff coughing)

1864
01:47:44.070 --> 01:47:45.550
- Widows and orphans.

1865
01:47:46.910 --> 01:47:47.743
- [Louie] What?

1866
01:47:49.150 --> 01:47:50.520
- [Jeff] Is that bullets.

1867
01:47:53.128 --> 01:47:56.380
After you left. Lou. Vito said orphans.

1868
01:48:01.890 --> 01:48:03.390
- Everything is gonna be okay.

1869
01:48:04.290 --> 01:48:08.110
Don't you worry. you can't leave me now.

1870
01:48:08.110 --> 01:48:10.230
You gotta be here for me and Timmy.

1871
01:48:12.622 --> 01:48:14.433
- Timmy. Timmy. I like that.

1872
01:48:22.900 --> 01:48:27.470
- No. no. no. no. no. no.

1873
01:48:28.830 --> 01:48:31.460
Goddammit Jeffery. you're
a fighter. so fight!

1874
01:48:33.430 --> 01:48:35.462
No! (sobbing)

1875
01:48:35.462 --> 01:48:36.295
- Fuck.

1876
01:48:38.550 --> 01:48:41.266
Maggie. I'm sorry.

1877
01:48:41.266 --> 01:48:44.230
- Go. just go.

1878
01:48:44.230 --> 01:48:46.980
(Maggie sobbing)

1879
01:48:53.130 --> 01:48:56.000
- I remember in that moment.
not fully understanding

1880
01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:59.200
what Jeff meant. until all
the pieces came together.

1881
01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:02.760
Jeff. he was adding to
a long list of widows

1882
01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:04.960
and orphans that his
life leads in its wake.

1883
01:49:05.870 --> 01:49:09.950
Him. me. even DeFrange's wife and kids.

1884
01:49:09.950 --> 01:49:12.730
I mean hell. even the fathers that live.

1885
01:49:12.730 --> 01:49:14.720
they're not really there.

1886
01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:16.913
That is when I knew. I had to get out.

1887
01:49:17.867 --> 01:49:20.617
(sirens wailing)

1888
01:49:26.260 --> 01:49:27.093
Hey.

1889
01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:30.440
- Hey. what happened to you?

1890
01:49:32.372 --> 01:49:33.422
Do you wanna come in?

1891
01:49:43.302 --> 01:49:45.210
- I hope it's okay. me
coming over like this.

1892
01:49:45.210 --> 01:49:46.770
- Sure. I was up anyway.

1893
01:49:46.770 --> 01:49:47.820
Can I get you a drink or something?

1894
01:49:47.820 --> 01:49:48.653
- No. I'm okay.

1895
01:49:53.203 --> 01:49:54.036
[Wendy] So...

1896
01:49:55.490 --> 01:49:56.323
- So...

1897
01:49:58.200 --> 01:49:59.900
- Do I have to drag it out of you?

1898
01:50:01.530 --> 01:50:04.080
- I gotta call. I had to be somewhere.

1899
01:50:06.870 --> 01:50:08.550
- [Wendy] Just leave at the drop of a hat.

1900
01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:13.040
- Yeah. seems so.

1901
01:50:15.170 --> 01:50:20.170
They. uh. want me to
take over. in Youngstown.

1902
01:50:29.930 --> 01:50:31.180
They fucking killed Jeff.

1903
01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:33.193
- What?
- Yeah.

1904
01:50:35.088 --> 01:50:36.070
They put a hit on him.

1905
01:50:37.290 --> 01:50:39.534
shot him right in front
of his fucking wife.

1906
01:50:39.534 --> 01:50:40.600
- What?

1907
01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:41.780
- Hell. there's more.

1908
01:50:41.780 --> 01:50:44.320
- No Lou. I don't wanna know more.

1909
01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:46.200
This is so crazy.

1910
01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:48.750
- I'm not who you think I am. Wendy.

1911
01:50:48.750 --> 01:50:49.850
I'm not a good person.

1912
01:50:51.090 --> 01:50:54.960
I've hurt a lot of people
for some bullshit cause.

1913
01:50:56.430 --> 01:50:58.180
- It's not about what you've done okay.

1914
01:50:58.180 --> 01:51:00.680
it matters who you are now.

1915
01:51:00.680 --> 01:51:02.630
And you are a good person.

1916
01:51:02.630 --> 01:51:04.500
I've always seen that in you.

1917
01:51:05.490 --> 01:51:06.940
- [Louie] No. I'm really not.

1918
01:51:06.940 --> 01:51:07.950
- Yes. you are.

1919
01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:11.151
- It's just. you don't--

1920
01:51:11.151 --> 01:51:14.710
- I don't nothing. it's what
you want in this life now.

1921
01:51:15.630 --> 01:51:17.260
That's what matters.

1922
01:51:17.260 --> 01:51:18.260
- All I want is you.

1923
01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:20.520
- Of course you want me.

1924
01:51:22.970 --> 01:51:24.660
- I remember once when I was a kid.

1925
01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:29.715
I was up in the loft of our
barn playing with my brother.

1926
01:51:29.715 --> 01:51:30.548
it was just us.

1927
01:51:32.820 --> 01:51:36.020
My dad was out by the lake
and he was fixing the fence.

1928
01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:39.640
I remember 'cause I took a breath

1929
01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:41.070
and I wanted to see the horses.

1930
01:51:42.514 --> 01:51:45.610
I saw my mom taking a
drink. she sat it down.

1931
01:51:47.155 --> 01:51:47.988
and he just grabbed her by the waist

1932
01:51:47.988 --> 01:51:49.580
and lifted her up and kissed her.

1933
01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:56.260
They went sat by the water
and they were just so happy.

1934
01:51:59.210 --> 01:52:00.410
Not a care in the world.

1935
01:52:03.300 --> 01:52:07.420
I was thinking. that's exactly how I feel

1936
01:52:08.490 --> 01:52:09.390
when I'm with you.

1937
01:52:10.430 --> 01:52:11.263
- [Wendy] Really?

1938
01:52:11.263 --> 01:52:14.910
- Yeah. all this bad shit
that keeps happening.

1939
01:52:14.910 --> 01:52:18.623
I don't care about any
of it when I'm with you.

1940
01:52:25.774 --> 01:52:27.027
- [Wendy] I'm really sorry.

1941
01:52:27.027 --> 01:52:28.928
- For what?

1942
01:52:28.928 --> 01:52:31.678
(dramatic music)

1943
01:53:15.100 --> 01:53:17.488
- [Wendy] What were you
thinking about just now?

1944
01:53:17.488 --> 01:53:18.672
- [Louie] Run away with me. Wendy.

1945
01:53:18.672 --> 01:53:19.649
- (chuckles) What. where?

1946
01:53:19.649 --> 01:53:22.420
- I'm serious. we can go right now.

1947
01:53:23.460 --> 01:53:24.460
- You're crazy. Lou.

1948
01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:26.710
- We could start a new life together.

1949
01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:30.250
Just you. me. my mom.

1950
01:53:30.250 --> 01:53:32.510
- Oh my gosh. your mom. I
haven't even met her yet.

1951
01:53:32.510 --> 01:53:33.620
- Well I can't just leave her.

1952
01:53:33.620 --> 01:53:34.870
We can remedy that today.

1953
01:53:36.161 --> 01:53:38.199
- What about my horses?

1954
01:53:38.199 --> 01:53:39.145
- They could come too.

1955
01:53:39.145 --> 01:53:40.090
- (laughs) Really?

1956
01:53:40.090 --> 01:53:40.923
- Yeah.

1957
01:53:42.623 --> 01:53:43.456
- Okay.

1958
01:53:44.295 --> 01:53:45.441
- Okay. what?

1959
01:53:45.441 --> 01:53:46.680
- All right. let's do it.

1960
01:53:46.680 --> 01:53:47.580
- Really?
- Yeah.

1961
01:53:49.224 --> 01:53:50.990
- All right. you're not gonna regret this.

1962
01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:52.840
- I'm sure I won't.

1963
01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:54.510
- What's that supposed to mean.

1964
01:53:54.510 --> 01:53:58.481
- What do you mean. what's
that supposed to mean?

1965
01:53:58.481 --> 01:54:01.231
(dramatic music)

1966
01:54:04.430 --> 01:54:06.330
- You sure you wanna do this?

1967
01:54:06.330 --> 01:54:07.580
- Of course.

1968
01:54:07.580 --> 01:54:09.560
- Okay. I'm just warning you.

1969
01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:11.670
she can be a little abrasive at times.

1970
01:54:11.670 --> 01:54:16.670
- Yeah. I think I can manage. (laughs)

1971
01:54:27.431 --> 01:54:28.335
- [Louie] You excited?

1972
01:54:28.335 --> 01:54:29.585
- [Wendy] Yeah.

1973
01:54:32.359 --> 01:54:34.470
- I feel like a captain abandoning ship.

1974
01:54:34.470 --> 01:54:36.410
leaving my best friend here to die.

1975
01:54:37.250 --> 01:54:39.900
The way I see it. there's only two roads

1976
01:54:39.900 --> 01:54:41.950
out of this godforsaken town.

1977
01:54:41.950 --> 01:54:45.160
One towards Paul Degorgio and the other.

1978
01:54:47.215 --> 01:54:50.885
where she's right by my side.

1979
01:54:50.885 --> 01:54:54.380
You take your pick.

1980
01:54:55.390 --> 01:54:56.814
Last chance.

1981
01:54:56.814 --> 01:54:58.300
(both laughing)

1982
01:54:58.300 --> 01:54:59.340
- Where the hell have you been?

1983
01:54:59.340 --> 01:55:00.960
The cops have kept me up all night

1984
01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:03.583
with flashing lights and
did you hear about Jeff?

1985
01:55:03.583 --> 01:55:08.570
Oh. (laughs) well I didn't
know you brought home a stray.

1986
01:55:08.570 --> 01:55:09.920
Are you gonna introduce me?

1987
01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:13.550
It isn't often we get some company coming.

1988
01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:15.470
- Mom. this is Wendy.

1989
01:55:15.470 --> 01:55:16.350
- Pleasure.

1990
01:55:16.350 --> 01:55:18.100
- Oh. well the pleasure's all mine.

1991
01:55:18.100 --> 01:55:19.890
Believe me. please come in.

1992
01:55:19.890 --> 01:55:20.980
- Thank you.

1993
01:55:20.980 --> 01:55:23.050
- Straight back this way.

1994
01:55:23.050 --> 01:55:24.930
- Wow. your place is really nice.

1995
01:55:24.930 --> 01:55:25.763
- Aww. thanks.

1996
01:55:26.725 --> 01:55:27.558
We're gonna have to talk later.

1997
01:55:27.558 --> 01:55:28.391
- Okay.

1998
01:55:29.430 --> 01:55:32.460
- It isn't often Louis brings
somebody home for a visit.

1999
01:55:37.494 --> 01:55:38.327
- [Wendy] You mind if I use your bathroom?

2000
01:55:38.327 --> 01:55:39.780
- Oh sure. it's just down the hall.

2001
01:55:39.780 --> 01:55:41.276
first door on the left.

2002
01:55:41.276 --> 01:55:44.750
- Left.

2003
01:55:44.750 --> 01:55:47.420
- So Lou. what's really going on here?

2004
01:55:47.420 --> 01:55:49.850
I mean it's not like I don't mind a visit

2005
01:55:49.850 --> 01:55:52.080
from my son and his girlfriend.

2006
01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:56.730
- Mom. after everything
that's been going on

2007
01:55:56.730 --> 01:56:00.280
in the past few days. I can't stay.

2008
01:56:02.190 --> 01:56:03.900
I can't keep living this
life that's not my own.

2009
01:56:03.900 --> 01:56:06.150
- [Mom] I'm so glad you realize that.

2010
01:56:07.130 --> 01:56:08.495
- Wendy and I. we decided to get out now.

2011
01:56:08.495 --> 01:56:09.990
And while we still can.

2012
01:56:11.270 --> 01:56:13.300
I want you to come with us.

2013
01:56:13.300 --> 01:56:16.820
- You think it's just a
fucking fairy tale ending?

2014
01:56:19.020 --> 01:56:22.280
- But Dad always wanted us to get out.

2015
01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:26.640
- Dad wanted you alive. Louis. alive.

2016
01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:29.410
- Mom. I am alive. right now!

2017
01:56:32.530 --> 01:56:35.470
- I'm not sure what he's
told you about what he does

2018
01:56:35.470 --> 01:56:40.383
or did. but 24 hours ago

2019
01:56:41.230 --> 01:56:43.170
he swore a fucking blood oath

2020
01:56:43.170 --> 01:56:46.690
to those fucking vampires.

2021
01:56:46.690 --> 01:56:48.250
- Mom. it's going away--

2022
01:56:48.250 --> 01:56:52.860
- Mom nothing. do you think
they're gonna forget about you?

2023
01:56:52.860 --> 01:56:53.693
- I can't keep working

2024
01:56:53.693 --> 01:56:55.410
for that fucking murderous psychopath.

2025
01:56:56.930 --> 01:56:59.020
- No. and I don't want you to either.

2026
01:56:59.020 --> 01:57:04.020
But. I don't know what
to do. I really don't.

2027
01:57:04.620 --> 01:57:06.000
But I know that if you run.

2028
01:57:07.070 --> 01:57:12.070
you'll never be safe from the
family or the cops. (sighs)

2029
01:57:16.540 --> 01:57:18.860
- Well then. will you still

2030
01:57:18.860 --> 01:57:21.040
just come with us for a few days?

2031
01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:22.290
Let everything blow over.

2032
01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:26.390
It'll give me time to come
up with some kind of a plan.

2033
01:57:30.430 --> 01:57:33.720
- Okay. sure. sure.

2034
01:57:35.310 --> 01:57:38.170
There's nothing I wouldn't
do for my little boy.

2035
01:57:40.110 --> 01:57:43.180
But. we better get going.

2036
01:57:45.300 --> 01:57:47.150
It's already dark and they're probably

2037
01:57:47.150 --> 01:57:49.740
coming for you sooner. rather than later.

2038
01:57:49.740 --> 01:57:50.573
- [Louie] Well.

2039
01:57:50.573 --> 01:57:53.500
- I just have to get my things around.

2040
01:57:53.500 --> 01:57:55.420
So you think you can go to the attic

2041
01:57:55.420 --> 01:57:57.250
and grab me a suitcase?

2042
01:57:57.250 --> 01:57:58.083
- [Louie] Yeah sure. Ma.

2043
01:57:58.083 --> 01:57:58.916
- Okay great.

2044
01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:14.830
It should be up there somewhere honey.

2045
01:58:14.830 --> 01:58:16.540
I haven't been up there in ages.

2046
01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:28.510
(dramatic music)

2047
01:58:35.541 --> 01:58:36.490
- [Wendy] Do you need any help. Lou?

2048
01:58:36.490 --> 01:58:39.340
- No. I've got 'em.

2049
01:58:42.150 --> 01:58:42.983
Coming down now.

2050
01:58:51.640 --> 01:58:52.904
- [Ma] You know we
should get some supplies

2051
01:58:52.904 --> 01:58:56.122
before we head out.

2052
01:58:56.122 --> 01:58:58.955
(Wendy murmuring)

2053
01:59:06.451 --> 01:59:07.951
- Maybe this one. ooh so sexy.

2054
01:59:22.156 --> 01:59:24.573
(Ma sighing)

2055
02:00:30.309 --> 02:00:31.659
- Where else do you wanna go?

2056
02:00:31.659 --> 02:00:35.748
- Uh. I've always been
particular on a beach.

2057
02:00:35.748 --> 02:00:38.111
Especially since I've only
seen it on TV when I was a kid.

2058
02:00:38.111 --> 02:00:40.020
- [Wendy] So how do you
know you'll like it?

2059
02:00:40.020 --> 02:00:42.693
- [Louie] Because I get to see
you in a bikini all the time.

2060
02:00:42.693 --> 02:00:44.450
- (laughs) Check things out.

2061
02:00:44.450 --> 02:00:46.082
- [Louie] Yeah.

2062
02:00:46.082 --> 02:00:48.286
Anything to get you outta those clothes.

2063
02:00:48.286 --> 02:00:51.119
(Wendy chuckling)

2064
02:01:00.382 --> 02:01:01.215
- [Louie] Here. for you.

2065
02:01:01.215 --> 02:01:02.590
- [Wendy] Thank you.

2066
02:01:02.590 --> 02:01:03.670
- [Louie] Mom. we're back.

2067
02:01:09.270 --> 02:01:10.520
- [Wendy] Oh my god. Lou.

2068
02:01:14.144 --> 02:01:19.144
- [Louie] Mom. no Mom!

2069
02:01:43.460 --> 02:01:44.960
- Tell me you did it.

2070
02:01:50.453 --> 02:01:52.453
Get the fuck outta here.

2071
02:01:55.333 --> 02:01:58.290
(sighs) I would have
killed to see the look

2072
02:01:58.290 --> 02:02:01.792
on the cocksucker Mancini's
face when it went down.

2073
02:02:01.792 --> 02:02:03.690
(laughs)

2074
02:02:03.690 --> 02:02:04.990
That's the price of power.

2075
02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:07.720
I gotta miss out on all the fun.

2076
02:02:19.310 --> 02:02:24.083
This is for you. that's
yours. you've earned it.

2077
02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:31.730
Oh. and I sweetened the deal a little bit

2078
02:02:31.730 --> 02:02:34.580
for taking care of the
suits and Mrs. Soreno.

2079
02:02:34.580 --> 02:02:36.850
Yeah. I know how you
feel about the contracts

2080
02:02:36.850 --> 02:02:40.620
involving broads. but can't
have her pulling Louie

2081
02:02:40.620 --> 02:02:42.880
out of operations. can't have it.

2082
02:02:46.390 --> 02:02:48.580
A woman's work is never done.

2083
02:02:50.683 --> 02:02:53.210
(laughs) But in her case. I'd say it is.

2084
02:02:59.905 --> 02:03:00.738
Oh my god.

2085
02:03:02.598 --> 02:03:06.130
You don't have a problem with that. right?

2086
02:03:06.130 --> 02:03:07.990
Rob. you don't have a problem here right?

2087
02:03:12.750 --> 02:03:16.040
Good. let's consider this
contract closed then.

2088
02:03:19.270 --> 02:03:20.510
I got a plane picking me up

2089
02:03:20.510 --> 02:03:22.050
to go to Long Island in two hours.

2090
02:03:30.200 --> 02:03:35.200
Oh Rob. I got a couple more
gifts for you out by the pool.

2091
02:03:36.220 --> 02:03:38.970
(dramatic music)

2092
02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:08.040
- Lucky bastard. huh?

2093
02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:10.880
- Yep. he show the fuck is.

2094
02:05:37.108 --> 02:05:40.608
- [Wendy] Louie. we have to call somebody.

2095
02:05:41.786 --> 02:05:42.619
- Who?

2096
02:05:44.261 --> 02:05:46.580
- [Wendy] I don't know. a priest.

2097
02:05:46.580 --> 02:05:48.470
the fucking cops. an ambulance.

2098
02:05:50.940 --> 02:05:52.590
- We do that and we're both dead.

2099
02:05:54.530 --> 02:05:58.690
Well we are. they own the fucking cops.

2100
02:06:00.890 --> 02:06:02.690
They own everything in this fucking town.

2101
02:06:03.740 --> 02:06:05.080
- [Wendy] We can't leave her here.

2102
02:06:05.080 --> 02:06:06.190
- No fucking shit!

2103
02:06:11.428 --> 02:06:12.443
I'm sorry. I just...

2104
02:06:28.730 --> 02:06:30.060
Can you hand me that towel?

2105
02:06:50.350 --> 02:06:53.680
Stay here. I'll be right back.

2106
02:07:02.790 --> 02:07:03.840
You bet your ass.

2107
02:07:19.312 --> 02:07:21.157
- You're not gonna tell me
what you're doing. are you?

2108
02:07:22.550 --> 02:07:23.500
- Call this number.

2109
02:07:27.750 --> 02:07:31.750
- FBI. that's it. you're
not even a goodbye?

2110
02:07:32.920 --> 02:07:34.270
You're just like my father.

2111
02:07:36.065 --> 02:07:37.660
- What do you want me to say. Wendy?

2112
02:07:37.660 --> 02:07:38.493
That I'm sorry?

2113
02:07:39.830 --> 02:07:42.820
Okay. I'm fucking sorry
for getting you involved.

2114
02:07:42.820 --> 02:07:44.960
- You're a fucking asshole!

2115
02:07:44.960 --> 02:07:45.793
Fuck you.

2116
02:07:52.428 --> 02:07:55.670
- You want me to tell you that I'm scared?

2117
02:07:55.670 --> 02:07:59.130
I'm scared. but what do
you do with the dead?

2118
02:08:00.790 --> 02:08:04.170
You bury 'em. that's it. you move on.

2119
02:08:07.580 --> 02:08:10.480
But if I come back and I
walk through that door.

2120
02:08:10.480 --> 02:08:12.430
you'll know that
everything's gonna be okay.

2121
02:08:17.060 --> 02:08:20.450
I've only got one chance
at keeping us safe.

2122
02:08:23.582 --> 02:08:26.860
(Wendy sobbing)

2123
02:08:26.860 --> 02:08:31.860
If not. well then say goodbye.

2124
02:08:33.424 --> 02:08:35.210
- No. no.(sobbing)

2125
02:08:37.755 --> 02:08:40.205
- At least know one thing.
I've always loved you.

2126
02:08:47.390 --> 02:08:50.750
Okay. every since the
first time in the diner.

2127
02:08:54.303 --> 02:08:55.290
A lot's changed in our lives.

2128
02:08:55.290 --> 02:08:58.160
but the greatest thing's been you.

2129
02:08:59.211 --> 02:09:00.100
- Really?
- Yeah.

2130
02:09:03.800 --> 02:09:08.800
- I'm so scared. I don't know what to do.

2131
02:09:16.581 --> 02:09:17.414
I love you.

2132
02:09:17.414 --> 02:09:22.360
- Hey. hey. hey.
everything's gonna be okay.

2133
02:09:23.707 --> 02:09:28.707
Okay. I promise.

2134
02:09:35.204 --> 02:09:36.037
Call.

2135
02:09:52.030 --> 02:09:54.697
(phone ringing)

2136
02:09:55.985 --> 02:09:59.760
- [Charles] Charles
Finley. FBI. who's calling?

2137
02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:00.661
Hello?

2138
02:10:00.661 --> 02:10:03.661
- Um. this is gonna sound crazy. um.

2139
02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:07.890
- I've been pushed. now
I have to push back.

2140
02:10:09.004 --> 02:10:12.000
Now I'll know this'll
probably be a one-way trip.

2141
02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.200
but I've gotta end this once and for all.

2142
02:10:20.180 --> 02:10:21.480
- Excuse me. Mr. Degorgio.

2143
02:10:24.850 --> 02:10:27.510
Your car's ready and your
plane's being fueled as we speak.

2144
02:10:27.510 --> 02:10:30.280
- Good. thank you Marco. I'll
meet you right out there.

2145
02:10:30.280 --> 02:10:32.430
I gotta take care of a
couple things right here.

2146
02:10:32.430 --> 02:10:36.680
- [Marco] Yes. sir.

2147
02:10:36.680 --> 02:10:38.720
- Eh. you can never be too careful. huh.

2148
02:11:04.479 --> 02:11:07.062
(man grunting)

2149
02:11:43.697 --> 02:11:44.530
- I want to talk to you

2150
02:11:44.530 --> 02:11:45.930
about that situation the other night.

2151
02:11:45.930 --> 02:11:46.940
- That situation.

2152
02:11:46.940 --> 02:11:49.070
- Yeah. a fucking mess.

2153
02:11:49.070 --> 02:11:50.340
- Mess indeed.

2154
02:11:50.340 --> 02:11:55.320
- It's bad for business
Marco. which got me thinking.

2155
02:11:57.060 --> 02:11:59.140
Maybe next time I send you to do the job

2156
02:11:59.140 --> 02:12:01.852
instead of contracting out to some joker.

2157
02:12:01.852 --> 02:12:05.170
- Really? (speaking in foreign language)

2158
02:12:05.170 --> 02:12:09.840
Mr. Degorgio. I'd be honored. sir.

2159
02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:14.260
- Ah. (speaking in foreign
language). I bet you would.

2160
02:12:14.260 --> 02:12:16.380
You know where have all the real men gone?

2161
02:12:16.380 --> 02:12:18.910
We've raised such a pussy generation.

2162
02:12:18.910 --> 02:12:20.890
I gotta contract out every single time

2163
02:12:20.890 --> 02:12:24.040
for a new set of balls
and it's wearing me thin.

2164
02:12:24.040 --> 02:12:27.450
But. I got a good feeling about tonight.

2165
02:12:27.450 --> 02:12:28.720
Marco. I got a good feeling.

2166
02:12:28.720 --> 02:12:30.345
- Yeah. me too.

2167
02:12:30.345 --> 02:12:32.240
(upbeat music)

2168
02:12:32.240 --> 02:12:33.590
- Catch the Fires game last night?

2169
02:12:33.590 --> 02:12:34.440
- [Gangster] Yeah. how 'bout that turn

2170
02:12:34.440 --> 02:12:35.930
from right field to third?

2171
02:12:35.930 --> 02:12:36.780
- Beautiful.

2172
02:12:36.780 --> 02:12:37.977

- So was my dad.

2252
02:15:55.450 --> 02:15:57.320

2258
02:16:10.905 --> 02:16:12.056
How 'bout it?

2259
02:16:12.056 --> 02:16:13.750
(Louie laughing)

2260
02:16:13.750 --> 02:16:15.167
- No fucking chance!

2261
02:16:15.167 --> 02:16:16.870
(gun banging)

2262
02:16:16.870 --> 02:16:19.520
- [Paul] Hey Louie. I'm
trying to be reasonable here.

2263
02:16:20.362 --> 02:16:22.710
(Paul laughing)

2264
02:16:22.710 --> 02:16:25.010
You really think you're
gonna kill all my men.

2265
02:16:26.090 --> 02:16:27.910
Fucking do now. fuck.

2266
02:16:27.910 --> 02:16:30.667
- No. just you.

2267
02:16:30.667 --> 02:16:33.167
(gun banging)

2268
02:16:38.990 --> 02:16:41.440
- Where's Robert. Mr. Degorgio?

2269
02:16:41.440 --> 02:16:42.860
Sir. I think you gotta hand it.

2270
02:16:45.497 --> 02:16:48.440
- When he does. you make a
break for the corridor back.

2271
02:16:48.440 --> 02:16:49.610
you get me the fuck outta here.

2272
02:16:49.610 --> 02:16:52.033
- Yes. sir.

2273
02:16:52.033 --> 02:16:52.910
Hey Louie!

2274
02:16:55.520 --> 02:16:58.660
If you want me. you gotta
fucking come and get me!

2275
02:17:00.256 --> 02:17:02.756
(gun banging)

2276
02:17:04.620 --> 02:17:06.243
- No problem.

2277
02:17:06.243 --> 02:17:07.771
(gun banging)

2278
02:17:07.771 --> 02:17:10.354
(upbeat music)

2279
02:18:00.629 --> 02:18:03.612
(Louie grunting)

2280
02:18:03.612 --> 02:18:05.274
(bones cracking)

2281
02:18:05.274 --> 02:18:07.857
(men grunting)

2282
02:18:43.171 --> 02:18:45.671
(gun banging)

2283
02:19:18.724 --> 02:19:22.641
- Just fucking do it. I
don't got nothing left.

2284
02:19:24.050 --> 02:19:26.128
(Paul yelling)
(tires squealing)

2285
02:19:26.128 --> 02:19:27.878
That fucking bastard.

2286
02:19:51.194 --> 02:19:52.027
Why?

2287
02:19:54.396 --> 02:19:56.979
(Rob coughing)

2288
02:19:58.843 --> 02:20:00.093
- Better hurry.

2289
02:20:02.682 --> 02:20:06.265
He's about to take the
red-eye out of here.

2290
02:20:17.610 --> 02:20:20.360
(sirens wailing)

2291
02:20:33.685 --> 02:20:35.222
- [Dispatcher] Arriving
officers. please be aware.

2292
02:20:35.222 --> 02:20:36.666
federal detectives in pursuit of suspects

2293
02:20:36.666 --> 02:20:38.665
leaving the facility.

2294
02:20:38.665 --> 02:20:40.469
Do not follow. secure the perimeter

2295
02:20:40.469 --> 02:20:42.219
and wait for S.W.A.T.

2296
02:20:44.238 --> 02:20:47.417
- Get me to the fucking
airport now. hurry.

2297
02:20:47.417 --> 02:20:48.250
Goddammit!

2298
02:20:51.434 --> 02:20:53.002
- How is it?

2299
02:20:53.002 --> 02:20:55.386
- It fucking hurts. what
do you mean how is it?

2300
02:20:55.386 --> 02:20:56.219
Fuck!

2301
02:20:57.448 --> 02:20:59.992
- [Marco] Okay we're coming
up. we're coming close.

2302
02:20:59.992 --> 02:21:02.335
- I should've whacked that
fuck when I had a chance.

2303
02:21:02.335 --> 02:21:03.547
- Oh fuck 'em. we'll get him.

2304
02:21:03.547 --> 02:21:05.591
We're gonna get that dirty son-of-a-bitch.

2305
02:21:05.591 --> 02:21:07.265
- [Paul] Okay. come on. come on. come on.

2306
02:21:07.265 --> 02:21:09.139
Let's go. let's go. go. go. go.

2307
02:21:09.139 --> 02:21:12.074
Come on. come on. come on.

2308
02:21:12.074 --> 02:21:14.491
All right I got it. I got it.

2309
02:21:15.369 --> 02:21:16.494
Fuck.
- Oh my god.

2310
02:21:16.494 --> 02:21:17.394
- [Paul] What are you doing?

2311
02:21:17.394 --> 02:21:18.306
- [Marco] Wait.

2312
02:21:18.306 --> 02:21:19.206
- [Paul] Come on!

2313
02:21:19.206 --> 02:21:20.123
- I'm coming fuck. hold on.

2314
02:21:20.123 --> 02:21:21.056
Go. go. go.

2315
02:21:21.056 --> 02:21:21.957
Ah. come on.

2316
02:21:21.957 --> 02:21:22.855
Get up. get up.
(Paul yelling)

2317
02:21:22.855 --> 02:21:24.272
Come on. come on.

2318
02:21:27.128 --> 02:21:29.961
- All right. all right. all right.

2319
02:21:30.880 --> 02:21:33.070
Let's get this thing in the air. let's go.

2320
02:21:33.070 --> 02:21:33.903
- [Pilot] Yes. sir.

2321
02:21:35.660 --> 02:21:39.150
- Marco. when we get up in the air.

2322
02:21:39.150 --> 02:21:40.410
I want you to go and get the med kit

2323
02:21:40.410 --> 02:21:41.660
from the back for me.

2324
02:21:41.660 --> 02:21:42.493
- Yes sir.

2325
02:21:42.493 --> 02:21:44.110
- I want you to get me
a doctor when we land.

2326
02:21:44.110 --> 02:21:46.041
- Yes sir.

2327
02:21:46.041 --> 02:21:48.870
- I swear to God if it's
the last thing I fucking do.

2328
02:21:48.870 --> 02:21:51.610
I'm gonna get that
son-of-a-bitch. I swear to God.

2329
02:21:51.610 --> 02:21:53.910
- I'm gonna blow his
motherfucking brains out.

2330
02:21:55.628 --> 02:21:59.128
(airplane engine roaring)

2331
02:22:00.102 --> 02:22:02.852
(sirens wailing)

2332
02:22:08.894 --> 02:22:10.561
- FBI.
- Louis. stop.

2333
02:22:11.849 --> 02:22:14.049
You're not gonna catch him now anyway.

2334
02:22:14.049 --> 02:22:17.010
Put the gun down and put
your hands behind your head.

2335
02:22:17.010 --> 02:22:17.843
- What for?

2336
02:22:20.190 --> 02:22:21.690
I can't just let him get away.

2337
02:22:23.970 --> 02:22:27.480
He fucking killed my
mom and my best friend.

2338
02:22:29.940 --> 02:22:30.850
My only friend.

2339
02:22:37.130 --> 02:22:42.130
My father was right. once they
sink their talons into you.

2340
02:22:48.950 --> 02:22:51.140
oh fuck. I wish I could
see him one more time.

2341
02:22:53.030 --> 02:22:54.930
So I could see how disappointed he is.

2342
02:22:58.560 --> 02:23:02.477
This place is like a lead
veil. suffocating you.

2343
02:23:04.260 --> 02:23:05.410
keeping you on the arm.

2344
02:23:08.860 --> 02:23:11.530
No one's safe. and it can't stay that way.

2345
02:23:13.930 --> 02:23:15.730
- It's up to you how this end's pal.

2346
02:23:17.110 --> 02:23:20.270
Do the smart thing here.
we'll bring him down together.

2347
02:23:36.296 --> 02:23:37.960
He killed my friend too.

2348
02:23:37.960 --> 02:23:41.020
He's not gonna get away
with it. if you help us.

2349
02:23:44.310 --> 02:23:45.910
- I'll do whatever I have to do.

2350
02:23:47.800 --> 02:23:50.590
Let's pull the whole
fucking steel curtain back.

2351
02:23:50.590 --> 02:23:54.920
- Good. I will.

2352
02:23:58.540 --> 02:24:00.320
So. Wendy seemed nice.

2353
02:24:01.941 --> 02:24:03.920
I didn't see her falling
for somebody like you.

2354
02:24:03.920 --> 02:24:08.920
but it didn't turn out half-bad.

2355
02:24:09.956 --> 02:24:12.450
(Louie grunting)

2356
02:24:12.450 --> 02:24:15.490
Oh. call an ambulance.
he's bleeding pretty bad.

2357
02:24:16.560 --> 02:24:17.690
You better hang your ass in there

2358
02:24:17.690 --> 02:24:20.520
if you wanna bring down
Degorgio and the rest of 'em.

2359
02:24:20.520 --> 02:24:23.060
- Fuck off. get me up.

2360
02:24:23.060 --> 02:24:25.411
- Here I thought you were
gonna puss out on me.

2361
02:24:25.411 --> 02:24:27.022
- (laughs) Fuck you.

2362
02:24:27.022 --> 02:24:28.180
(men laughing)

2363
02:24:28.180 --> 02:24:29.180
- That's the spirit.

2364
02:24:31.427 --> 02:24:33.377
Come on. let's go get Rambo patched up.

2365
02:24:34.866 --> 02:24:37.533
(upbeat music)

2366
02:24:55.258 --> 02:24:58.120
- The next few months.
things around town changed.

2367
02:24:58.120 --> 02:25:00.700
After I got out of the hospital.
I spend most of my time

2368
02:25:00.700 --> 02:25:02.960
in and out of witness protection

2369
02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:04.160
and testifying in court.

2370
02:25:09.679 --> 02:25:12.450
I've never seen so many
pissed off people in my life.

2371
02:25:15.220 --> 02:25:17.670
All in all. I single handedly brought down

2372
02:25:17.670 --> 02:25:19.820
two of the largest kingpins of our time.

2373
02:25:19.820 --> 02:25:22.080
Mancini and Degorgio.

2374
02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:23.600
Plus about 14 others.

2375
02:25:23.600 --> 02:25:24.840
but what did that get me?

2376
02:25:26.270 --> 02:25:29.610
Four years in the federal
pen. for what you ask?

2377
02:25:29.610 --> 02:25:33.092
Well. illegally possessing
an automatic firearm.

2378
02:25:33.092 --> 02:25:34.680
My dad's Tommy gun.

2379
02:25:37.397 --> 02:25:40.241
(man laughing)

2380
02:25:40.241 --> 02:25:42.190
And a whole slew of other
gun charge bullshit.

2381
02:25:42.190 --> 02:25:43.940
The fucking judge. he was no saint.

2382
02:25:45.480 --> 02:25:49.260
But. I guess it was a lot more
than Wendy could bargain for.

2383
02:25:49.260 --> 02:25:51.720
After only a few months.
she stopped visiting.

2384
02:26:30.740 --> 02:26:32.720
So now you're probably asking yourself.

2385
02:26:32.720 --> 02:26:35.220
is he really sorry for
everything that he's done?

2386
02:26:35.220 --> 02:26:37.450
Did I repay my debt to society?

2387
02:26:38.520 --> 02:26:40.660
I mean. I'm a bad guy right?

2388
02:26:40.660 --> 02:26:42.160
At least in your eyes anyways.

2389
02:26:43.120 --> 02:26:46.490
I killed. stole. lied.
and cheated for the mob.

2390
02:26:47.860 --> 02:26:50.940
not to mention I lost
my dad. mom. brother.

2391
02:26:51.920 --> 02:26:53.170
hell even my best friend.

2392
02:26:54.090 --> 02:26:58.020
But. hi mamacita.

2393
02:27:05.801 --> 02:27:09.218
So. the answer's pretty simple. fuck you.

2394
02:27:11.658 --> 02:27:13.091
how 'bout that?

2395
02:27:13.091 --> 02:27:15.674
(upbeat music)

2396
02:28:56.723 --> 02:28:59.306
(upbeat music)

2397
02:31:04.803 --> 02:31:07.211
(horn honking)

2398
02:31:07.211 --> 02:31:10.378
(movie reel clicking)
