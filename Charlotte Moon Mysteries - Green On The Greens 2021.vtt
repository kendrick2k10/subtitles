asleep in the guest room.

if she knew you were
running around out here.

-What's this?
-It's a tie.

like you running around
with his nice tie.

You're gonna be late

Open this door
or I'm telling Mom

43
00:03:46.965 --> 00:03:49.577
that you wore her Chanel dress
to that party last weekend!

You wouldn't dare!

Oh. yes. I would.

What happened
to Dad's golf cart?

51
00:04:22.436 --> 00:04:24.655
I know. what have I done?

00:04:25.787 --> 00:04:28.093
[scoffs] Oh. my gosh!

53
00:04:28.137 --> 00:04:30.792
Dad is gonna be so pissed.

54
00:04:30.835 --> 00:04:33.664
Nope. Panic. I'm feeling
panic right now. Dalton.

55
00:04:33.707 --> 00:04:36.754
I'm-- I'm gonna be grounded
forever after this. okay?

56
00:04:36.798 --> 00:04:39.975
He's gonna take away my phone.
he's gonna take away my car.

00:04:44.675 --> 00:04:45.676
What happened?

60
00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:49.637
Dalton and I went joyriding
in the golf course last night.

61
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.074
and I kind of lost control.

62
00:04:52.117 --> 00:04:54.816
Ouch. There it is.
ripped off like a Band-Aid.

63
00:04:55.817 --> 00:04:59.473
[chuckles] It is so jacked.

64
00:04:59.516 --> 00:05:01.823
What exactly did you hit?

65
00:05:01.866 --> 00:05:06.915
I think it was. like. a fairway
sign or maybe it was a fence.

66
00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.004
It just happened so fast.

67
00:05:09.047 --> 00:05:12.007
Aubrey. You are so dead.

68
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.271
She's so right too.
I mean. we can't take it
to the club for maintenance.

69
00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.795
They're--
they're just gonna recognize it.

70
00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:20.842
But don't worry. I'm sure
we can figure something out.

71
00:05:20.885 --> 00:05:22.409
Right now I gotta go to work.

72
00:05:22.452 --> 00:05:26.500
I gotta start loading
the beer cart. I'm sorry.

73
00:05:26.543 --> 00:05:28.066
[Aubrey]
Wait. you're
just gonna leave me?

74
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.982
-Yeah. um. sorry. I gotta go.
-Dalton!

75
00:05:32.462 --> 00:05:34.943

Do not leave me like he did.

76
00:05:34.986 --> 00:05:36.423
You have to help me with this!

77
00:05:36.466 --> 00:05:39.556
Okay. Alright.
I'll give you some advice.

78
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.298
Pack your Gucci bags
and book a flight.

79
00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:44.344

when he gets back from D.C.

80
00:05:44.387 --> 00:05:46.868
Charlotte. I am serious. okay?

81
00:05:46.911 --> 00:05:49.784
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do with this.
Please. help me!

82
00:05:49.827 --> 00:05:53.831
[sighs] Alright. alright.
We'll figure it out.
But after tennis.

83
00:05:53.875 --> 00:05:56.747
You know. you are really pushing
the bounds of sisterhood here.

84
00:05:57.792 --> 00:05:59.576
Alright. I got it.

85
00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.013
Meet me at the gazebo at 1:00.

86
00:06:02.057 --> 00:06:03.580
We don't want Mom
to hear our noise.

87
00:06:03.624 --> 00:06:05.452
-Now. help me cover this.
-Okay.

00:06:20.118 --> 00:06:20.989
Okay.

[sighs] No. thanks.

95
00:06:44.012 --> 00:06:45.230
I feel like I'm gonna puke.

96
00:06:45.274 --> 00:06:47.407
I've got so much to lose here.

97
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.105
Okay. so. I've been
thinking about it
and I have two plans in mind.

98
00:06:50.148 --> 00:06:52.455
Do you want to hear
plan A or plan B?

99
00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:54.414
Plan A. I guess.

100
00:06:54.457 --> 00:06:56.503
Right. So you're going to tell
your friends to come over here

101
00:06:56.546 --> 00:06:57.982
with all the money they've got.

102
00:06:58.026 --> 00:06:59.767
Uh. cash. credit cards.

103
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.856
Starbucks gift cards.
kidneys to sell. anything.

104
00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:05.250
Okay. I think I have
about $60 in here.

105
00:07:05.294 --> 00:07:08.210
Good. That's good. because
you're gonna need to sweet-talk

106
00:07:08.253 --> 00:07:10.168
that creep Tucker up the street.

107
00:07:10.212 --> 00:07:12.170
His dad owns Teed Up Golf Carts.

108
00:07:12.214 --> 00:07:15.043
they'll probably be able
to get it picked up and fixed.

109
00:07:15.086 --> 00:07:17.524
But you're gonna have to
pay him a little extra
to keep it a secret.

110
00:07:17.567 --> 00:07:22.180
Wait. what?
You expect me to seduce
Tucker Gates into helping me?

111
00:07:22.224 --> 00:07:25.096
-He'll never fall for it.
-Oh. yeah. he will.

112
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.534
He's had a crush on you
since. like. ever.

113
00:07:27.577 --> 00:07:30.145
Now go on. put your big girl
panties on and run over there.

114
00:07:30.188 --> 00:07:32.408
And be like. what? "Hi. Tucker.

115
00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:34.671
I know I've always treated you
like you've had herpes.

116
00:07:34.715 --> 00:07:36.847
but will you please
help me now?"

117
00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:40.503
Uh. yeah. Do you want to live
to see your junior prom?

118
00:07:40.547 --> 00:07:43.375
[sighs] Listen. I'm telling you.
you have to go over there.

119
00:07:43.419 --> 00:07:45.769
Be his damsel in distress.
you know?

120
00:07:45.813 --> 00:07:49.077
[fake crying] "Tucker.
sweet sweet Tucker.

121
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.601
Please. hold me.
You just have to be my hero."

122
00:07:51.645 --> 00:07:54.822
No. No.
I won't be able to do it.

123
00:07:54.865 --> 00:07:56.345
[sighs] What's plan B?

124
00:07:58.129 --> 00:08:01.611
Uh. plan B is kind
of like the truth.
but a little bit twisted.

125
00:08:01.655 --> 00:08:04.092
-You know. like
how the devil does it.
-Ah!

126
00:08:04.135 --> 00:08:07.574
Mom will be so proud
you're putting your Sunday
school lessons to good use.

127
00:08:07.617 --> 00:08:11.055
But I'm desperate.
so let's hear it.

128
00:08:11.099 --> 00:08:13.536
We're going to have to
get rid of the golf cart.

129
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.277
and pretend it was stolen.

130
00:08:17.192 --> 00:08:21.501
Wow. That's actually
a really good idea
if we can pull it off that is.

131
00:08:21.544 --> 00:08:24.242
Yeah. Yeah. it'll be simple.
We'll just have to
go when it's dark.

132
00:08:24.286 --> 00:08:27.985
and push the golf cart
across the golf course
and sink it into the lake.

133
00:08:28.029 --> 00:08:31.032
And tell Mom that you parked
in the driveway or something.

134
00:08:31.075 --> 00:08:33.381
Alright. That sounds doable.

135
00:08:33.424 --> 00:08:36.472
You're gonna have to
get Dalton to come to
the utility doors at midnight.

136
00:08:36.515 --> 00:08:39.039
-and be dressed
for stealth mode.
-Okay.

137
00:08:39.082 --> 00:08:41.695
Wait. but Brynn is
still staying with us.

138
00:08:41.738 --> 00:08:44.306
-What are we gonna
do with her?
-She'll be fine. You know her.

139
00:08:44.349 --> 00:08:46.787
She'll be completely tuned out
with a movie on.

140
00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.006
Ah. thank you so much. sis.

141
00:08:51.095 --> 00:08:54.142
[suspenseful music]

142
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:57.928
[knocking on door]

143
00:09:01.671 --> 00:09:03.368
Finn. you came.

144
00:09:03.412 --> 00:09:06.850
Well. you sounded
pretty desperate. So here I am.

145
00:09:06.894 --> 00:09:09.984
What's up with the Goth look?
You said to wear camouflage.

146
00:09:10.027 --> 00:09:12.943
-Are we going to
a rave or something?
-Yeah. I wish.

147
00:09:15.424 --> 00:09:17.382
That's who you sent out
to help us?

148
00:09:17.426 --> 00:09:19.602
I'm pretty sure
I'm stronger than he is!

149
00:09:19.646 --> 00:09:21.865
Aubrey. be nice.

150
00:09:21.909 --> 00:09:23.737
I don't see Dalton here helping.

151
00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:26.087
Yeah. you're right.

152
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.219
I should be glad that
you found a replacement.

153
00:09:28.263 --> 00:09:30.308
Finn. thank you
so much for coming out.

154
00:09:30.352 --> 00:09:32.006
I'm pretty sure you're
stronger than you look.

155
00:09:32.049 --> 00:09:34.617
You know. one day
I'm going to fill out

156
00:09:34.661 --> 00:09:37.228
and you will be drooling
at the sight of me.

157
00:09:37.272 --> 00:09:41.276
Right. Okay. now. Come back here
and help me push this.

158
00:09:45.062 --> 00:09:47.282
[Finn]
Alright. You think
Dalton could do this?

159
00:09:47.325 --> 00:09:50.677
[Aubrey scoffs]
Probably. if he didn't ditch me.

160
00:09:51.678 --> 00:09:52.722
Whatever.

161
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.073
It's fine. Alright.

162
00:09:58.075 --> 00:09:59.294
[Charlotte]
Keep pushing.

163
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.601
Stop!

164
00:10:06.344 --> 00:10:08.172
[Scarlet]
Charlotte. Charlotte.

165
00:10:09.086 --> 00:10:10.261
[Charlotte]
Scarlet?

166
00:10:11.828 --> 00:10:13.917
-What are you doing here?
-I know you said not to come.

167
00:10:13.961 --> 00:10:16.659
but we figured you'd need
all the help you can get.

168
00:10:16.703 --> 00:10:18.922
We can't just sit by

00:18:33.938 --> 00:18:36.158
I'm totally coming
with you to see Tanner.

336
00:18:36.202 --> 00:18:38.378
[both chuckle]

337
00:18:46.647 --> 00:18:49.650
-Morning. Helen.
-[Helen] Oh. Chief Bud!

338
00:18:49.693 --> 00:18:51.478
You're not at church with Bunny?

339
00:18:51.521 --> 00:18:53.306
No. it's been a busy morning.

340
00:18:53.349 --> 00:18:55.177
Choir is gonna have
to do without me today.

341
00:18:56.178 --> 00:19:00.095
Dixie radioed me and tells me
your golf cart's gone missing.

342
00:19:00.139 --> 00:19:02.097
Yes. And I can't
believe it. I mean.

343
00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:04.795
I've never heard of anything
like that happening around here.

344
00:19:04.839 --> 00:19:08.799
Well. it's rare.
but sometimes things do have
a way of wandering off.

345
00:19:08.843 --> 00:19:10.149
When's the last time you saw it?

346
00:19:11.715 --> 00:19:14.544
Oh. well. Jack's out of town.
Of course. I don't use it.

347
00:19:14.588 --> 00:19:16.546
Um. the girls like
to use it though. actually.

348
00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:18.809
Aubrey was the last one
to use it a couple days ago.

349
00:19:18.853 --> 00:19:20.985
She said she left it
parked in the driveway.

350
00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:22.509
Is that right? You were driving?

351
00:19:22.552 --> 00:19:23.640
Yes.

352
00:19:25.076 --> 00:19:27.862
And when you parked it.
you left the key in it?

353
00:19:27.905 --> 00:19:29.951
Yeah. I mean.
we always leave the key in it.

354
00:19:29.994 --> 00:19:32.910
I was gonna move it down to
the utility room in the morning.

355
00:19:32.954 --> 00:19:36.044
And you didn't think about it
at all yesterday?

356
00:19:36.087 --> 00:19:40.788
Um. no. actually
I forgot all about it.

357
00:19:41.919 --> 00:19:44.574
-So you figure it's
been missing over 24 hours?
-Yeah.

358
00:19:44.618 --> 00:19:47.838
-Charlotte noticed
it was gone this morning.
-[Bud] Mm-hmm.

359
00:19:47.882 --> 00:19:51.233
-What does it look like?
-[Helen] Uh. well. it's white.

360
00:19:51.277 --> 00:19:53.888
It has Carolina Panthers
stickers on it.

361
00:19:53.931 --> 00:19:56.847
[chuckles] You know. Jackie
just loves his football.

362
00:19:56.891 --> 00:19:59.154
Well. I think I already
found it this morning.

363
00:19:59.198 --> 00:20:02.505
Oh. that's wonderful.
You know. I just figured
some kids took a joyriding.

364
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:05.682
-Probably hadn't gone far.
-No. no. it didn't.

365
00:20:05.726 --> 00:20:09.338
But it looks like
it might have been involved
in a bit of an incident.

366
00:20:09.382 --> 00:20:12.602
So. I have to hold on to it
for a few days.

367
00:20:12.646 --> 00:20:15.649
Oh. it's nothing serious.
I hope.

368
00:20:15.692 --> 00:20:18.826
-[Dixie on radio]
Chief Bud. you there?
-Yes. Dixie. I'm here.

369
00:20:20.784 --> 00:20:24.397
[Dixie on radio]
Bunny called. She said you left
your cell phone at home again.

370
00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.616
She wants you to pick up
some vanilla wafers

371
00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:29.315
with a banana pudding
on your way home.

372
00:20:29.358 --> 00:20:30.968
Alrighty. darling. Will do.

373
00:20:33.406 --> 00:20:37.061
I'm not sure what to make of
what happened to your cart
right now.

374
00:20:37.105 --> 00:20:40.804
But when Jack gets back.
just have him give me a call.

375
00:20:40.848 --> 00:20:43.764
That's all for now.
You all have a nice day.

376
00:20:43.807 --> 00:20:46.201
Alright. Chief Bud. Thank you!

377
00:20:48.203 --> 00:20:50.292
Mom? You okay?

378
00:20:50.336 --> 00:20:51.728
Oh. yeah.

379
00:20:53.643 --> 00:20:56.777
I guess we'll just have to start
locking things up around here.

380
00:21:03.087 --> 00:21:06.003
[birds chirping]

381
00:21:06.047 --> 00:21:09.050
[footsteps approaching]

382
00:21:09.093 --> 00:21:12.532
-Hey. Tanner.
-Hey. baby girl. how are you?

383
00:21:12.575 --> 00:21:14.360
I'm good. How's your mama?

384
00:21:14.403 --> 00:21:18.538
Oh. you know her. Stirring
the pot around town as usual.

385
00:21:18.581 --> 00:21:20.322
Do you remember my friend Roxi?

386
00:21:20.366 --> 00:21:23.369
Yes. ma'am.
How are you doing. Miss Roxie?

387
00:21:23.412 --> 00:21:25.806
Hotter than ever. Ooh!

388
00:21:25.849 --> 00:21:30.941
[chuckles] Well. if you mean
the weather. it is. um. humid.

389
00:21:30.985 --> 00:21:33.379
[chuckles softly]
So what'd you bring me?

390
00:21:33.422 --> 00:21:35.468
You know I'm a slave
to your baking talent.

391
00:21:35.511 --> 00:21:37.513
Your favorite. lemon pound cake.

392
00:21:37.557 --> 00:21:39.210
Oh. yes. [chuckles]

393
00:21:41.082 --> 00:21:42.997
[sighs]

394
00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.781
Hello. Officer Hart.

395
00:21:44.825 --> 00:21:46.653
Looks like you have
some good company today.

396
00:21:46.696 --> 00:21:48.481
Good afternoon. ma'am.

397
00:21:48.524 --> 00:21:50.787
-You're working on a Sunday?
-Oh. no. not really.

398
00:21:50.831 --> 00:21:54.574
I just remembered something
that I needed to talk
to Chief Bud about.

399
00:21:54.617 --> 00:21:57.359
Well. I'm sorry.
he's not here right now. Uh...

400
00:21:57.403 --> 00:22:01.668
-Can I help you?
-Oh. gosh. no. No. thank you.

401
00:22:03.234 --> 00:22:06.368
I'm Scarlet. Tanner's cousin.
This is my friend Roxi.

402
00:22:06.412 --> 00:22:09.415
Oh! Hello! Dr. Sarah Owens.

403
00:22:09.458 --> 00:22:11.547
The county's
new medical examiner.

404
00:22:11.591 --> 00:22:13.375
So nice to meet both of you.

405
00:22:13.419 --> 00:22:15.377
Would you like to have some
lemonade and cake with us?

406
00:22:15.421 --> 00:22:17.510
Oh. gosh. I couldn't.

407
00:22:17.553 --> 00:22:20.251
But. uh-- but thank you
so much. [chuckles]

408
00:22:20.295 --> 00:22:21.470
[chuckles softly]

409
00:22:22.819 --> 00:22:24.560
You just got some. uh...

410
00:22:25.648 --> 00:22:28.085
...some feather. Right here.

411
00:22:28.129 --> 00:22:31.872
Oh! Oh my. How embarrassing.

412
00:22:31.915 --> 00:22:37.181
Thank you. Um... [stutters]
I'll be back... tomorrow.

413
00:22:37.225 --> 00:22:39.488
-Have a good day. Doctor Owens.
-Bye.

414
00:22:39.532 --> 00:22:43.057
[birds chirping]

415
00:22:45.189 --> 00:22:50.934
So... [sighs] you mentioned
I had to earn your cake.

416
00:22:52.501 --> 00:22:54.198
What is it you want exactly?

417
00:22:54.242 --> 00:22:56.026
Nothing big.

418
00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:57.941
Just a little information

419
00:22:57.985 --> 00:23:00.944
-on a recent death
in my neighborhood.
-Uh-huh.

420
00:23:00.988 --> 00:23:03.686
You mean
the demise of Harley Trudeau.

421
00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:06.733
Well. it is the talk
of the town in the station.

422
00:23:06.776 --> 00:23:09.126
Well then. I'm sure
it's not hard to hear

423
00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:12.086
a few tidbits in that
tiny office you all share?

424
00:23:12.129 --> 00:23:13.653
True.

425
00:23:13.696 --> 00:23:15.132
So. what's on your mind?

426
00:23:15.176 --> 00:23:18.788
Well. we're wondering
what killed him.

427
00:23:18.832 --> 00:23:22.270
Is it natural or otherwise?

428
00:23:22.313 --> 00:23:25.404
Yeah. so weird him dying out
on the golf course

429
00:23:25.447 --> 00:23:26.579
in the middle of the night.

430
00:23:29.625 --> 00:23:33.194
What morbidly curious minds
you do have. little ladies.

431
00:23:33.237 --> 00:23:37.241
[chuckles] I like it.
but it's gonna cost you.

432
00:23:39.069 --> 00:23:42.072
This pound cake. a...

433
00:23:43.073 --> 00:23:46.860
...peach cobbler next week and
a pecan pie the week after that.

434
00:23:46.903 --> 00:23:50.080
And I want a free
cup of coffee every day.

435
00:23:50.124 --> 00:23:53.606
Miss Roxie is working
from that Java joint
until the end of that period.

436
00:23:53.649 --> 00:23:55.477
[inhales]

437
00:23:55.521 --> 00:23:57.697
Mm. Agreed?

438
00:24:01.004 --> 00:24:03.224
Drive a hard bargain.
Officer Hart.

439
00:24:04.965 --> 00:24:06.967
-Agreed.
-[chuckles]

440
00:24:08.447 --> 00:24:11.493
Yay! Call me later
with the details.

441
00:24:11.537 --> 00:24:15.715
You've been saying that medical
examiner lady is sweet on you.
it shouldn't be hard.

442
00:24:15.758 --> 00:24:17.456
Alright now. Never you mind.

443
00:24:19.022 --> 00:24:20.720
[Tanner]
Oh. I got my ways.

444
00:24:22.112 --> 00:24:24.463
Y'all stay out of trouble now.
Alright?

445
00:24:24.506 --> 00:24:25.855
Oh. we will.

446
00:24:25.899 --> 00:24:27.204
-Bye.
-Bye.

447
00:24:27.248 --> 00:24:28.162
Bye.

448
00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:32.645
Hey. what you got?

449
00:24:32.688 --> 00:24:35.517
Oh. no. Hands off. Hands off.

450
00:24:35.561 --> 00:24:38.302
You're like a vacuum. Em.
Don't you dare. don't you dare.

451
00:24:38.346 --> 00:24:40.740
Come on. share.

452
00:24:40.783 --> 00:24:43.394
Why do you always get
the goodies and the girls?

453
00:24:43.438 --> 00:24:47.181
-Poor Em gets nothing!
Don't you feel sad for me?
-[sighs]

454
00:24:47.224 --> 00:24:50.663
Yeah. Yeah. as a matter of fact.
I do feel sorry for you

455
00:24:50.706 --> 00:24:55.102
all the time. because you're
nothing but a pathetic beggar.

456
00:24:55.145 --> 00:24:57.104
And don't you be eyeballing
those girls. alright?

457
00:24:57.147 --> 00:24:59.759
-That's my cousin
and her friend.
-Oh. I know that.

458
00:24:59.802 --> 00:25:01.282
Well. they're just kids.

459
00:25:01.325 --> 00:25:03.545
Jeez. what kind of person
do you think I am?

460
00:25:03.589 --> 00:25:05.547
I'm not talking
about them either.

461
00:25:05.591 --> 00:25:08.681
I'm talking about
proper young ladies
that come around here.

462
00:25:08.724 --> 00:25:11.161
You're always catching
their eyes. and I'm just like

463
00:25:11.205 --> 00:25:13.424
grandma's wallpaper.
just kind of hanging there.

464
00:25:13.468 --> 00:25:15.339
Alright. Alright.

465
00:25:15.383 --> 00:25:17.428
You can have a piece of cake.

466
00:25:17.472 --> 00:25:19.735
Just quit whining.
You're ruining my appetite.

467
00:25:19.779 --> 00:25:20.867
Would you open the door?

468
00:25:23.522 --> 00:25:24.958
Where's Cal?

469
00:25:25.001 --> 00:25:27.003
He doesn't want
to join our roundtable?

470
00:25:27.047 --> 00:25:29.353
No. He's sticking
close to home these days.

471
00:25:29.397 --> 00:25:31.573
His mom was pretty upset
he was out so late.

472
00:25:31.617 --> 00:25:33.967
I think he's grounded.
He couldn't talk when I called.

473
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:37.579
Oh. no boyf' for a few days?
How will you survive?

474
00:25:37.623 --> 00:25:39.842
Don't tease me. Roxi.

475
00:25:39.886 --> 00:25:42.758
He had a traumatic experience
and I wasn't there
to hug him through it.

476
00:25:42.802 --> 00:25:45.805
You can give me a hug
if you want. I'm short of hugs.

477
00:25:45.848 --> 00:25:48.242
Actually. I'm pretty sure
my hug jar is empty.

478
00:25:48.285 --> 00:25:51.201
Finn. you desire
actual human contact?

479
00:25:51.245 --> 00:25:53.682
[laughs] Ouch!

480
00:25:53.726 --> 00:25:55.075
Hilarious. Roxi.

481
00:25:56.206 --> 00:25:57.947
Oh. get this.

482
00:25:57.991 --> 00:26:02.125
Dish is. the victim.
is Harley Trudeau.

483
00:26:03.039 --> 00:26:04.867
The notorious lawyer
on fourth floor?

484
00:26:04.911 --> 00:26:06.521
It didn't look like him
in the pond.

485
00:26:06.565 --> 00:26:09.045
That's because his face
is all frozen like...

486
00:26:09.089 --> 00:26:11.787
Oh. come on.
His face wasn't that bad.

487
00:26:11.831 --> 00:26:13.223
Okay. That is not funny.

488
00:26:13.267 --> 00:26:14.573
That was the most
horrific experience

489
00:26:14.616 --> 00:26:16.531
I've ever had in my life. okay?

490
00:26:16.575 --> 00:26:19.403
And I saw the Sawmovies.
It's different when it's real.

491
00:26:19.447 --> 00:26:23.494
Come on. Can we please just
remember that Aubrey. you...

492
00:26:24.452 --> 00:26:27.542
...correction. "we" are
in big. big trouble here.

493
00:26:28.804 --> 00:26:31.894
-What else did you find out?
-Tanner said the victim is
in his early sixties.

494
00:26:31.938 --> 00:26:35.550
obese and known to be
a heavy smoker and drinker.

495
00:26:35.594 --> 00:26:40.424
Also. his body is believed
to have wounds from both
strangulation and hit and run.

496
00:26:40.468 --> 00:26:42.426
-[gasps]
-[Scarlet] Yeah.

497
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:45.081
So. the golf cart.

498
00:26:45.125 --> 00:26:49.303
your golf cart is what Chief Bud
thinks he was hit with.

499
00:26:49.346 --> 00:26:52.654
Oh. sugar. honey. ice tea.
This is what I get for lying!

500
00:26:52.698 --> 00:26:56.571
Chief Bud is probably wondering
if the driver was Aubrey
or a thief. right?

501
00:26:56.615 --> 00:26:59.574
He doesn't know for sure.
or else Aubrey would
already be arrested.

502
00:26:59.618 --> 00:27:01.881
Oh. gracious.
I'm going to the big house.

503
00:27:01.924 --> 00:27:04.187
No. no. no. no. no. come on.

504
00:27:04.231 --> 00:27:06.015
I'm sure that's not the case.

505
00:27:06.059 --> 00:27:08.452
I mean. Chief Bud knows
our family from church.

506
00:27:08.496 --> 00:27:10.585
so that probably helps.

507
00:27:10.629 --> 00:27:13.327
And it'll take him a few days
to come to his final decision.

508
00:27:15.329 --> 00:27:18.811
So... all we need to do is

509
00:27:18.854 --> 00:27:21.335
figure out who killed
Harley Trudeau

510
00:27:21.378 --> 00:27:23.598
before Chief Bud can
jump to the wrong conclusion.

511
00:27:23.642 --> 00:27:25.644
No. we have to tell the truth.

512
00:27:25.687 --> 00:27:27.994
Giving my college money
to your dad to fix the cart

513
00:27:28.037 --> 00:27:32.302
is better than going
to prison for murder
and then getting f'ed there.

514
00:27:32.346 --> 00:27:35.131
You know what? I know
when it's time to get out.

515
00:27:35.175 --> 00:27:37.438
and that time is now.

516
00:27:37.481 --> 00:27:42.573
But I'm sorry. Char. but fight
or flight. I gotta fly. Later.

517
00:27:42.617 --> 00:27:46.752
Finn. come on.
we can do this. Guys?

518
00:27:46.795 --> 00:27:49.711
It's not over
till the fat lady sings.

519
00:27:49.755 --> 00:27:52.671
Or until one of us
gets arrested. but...

520
00:27:52.714 --> 00:27:54.324
...three days is all I'm asking.

521
00:27:56.239 --> 00:27:59.329
Chief Bud is gonna need
some time to conduct
his investigation. right?

522
00:27:59.373 --> 00:28:00.287
Who's with me?

523
00:28:01.418 --> 00:28:03.464
-I am.
-I am.

524
00:28:04.465 --> 00:28:06.641
-We are.
-Okay. We're in.

525
00:28:06.685 --> 00:28:08.774
So. where do we start?

526
00:28:11.907 --> 00:28:13.735
[sighs]

527
00:28:13.779 --> 00:28:16.956
-You sure this is
the Trudeau House.
-Yep.

528
00:28:16.999 --> 00:28:19.741
I don't see any other cars.
except for Harley's Jag.

529
00:28:19.785 --> 00:28:21.917
I don't see their cart either.

530
00:28:21.961 --> 00:28:23.702
Maybe she's just out to dinner.

531
00:28:23.745 --> 00:28:27.183
Yeah. We should just probably
wait it out for a bit.

532
00:28:27.227 --> 00:28:28.532
[sighs] I agree.

533
00:28:41.632 --> 00:28:43.591
Do I hear someone coming?

534
00:28:43.634 --> 00:28:45.071
No. that's probably fine.

535
00:28:50.598 --> 00:28:52.861
Well. that-- I guess
that could be--

536
00:28:52.905 --> 00:28:55.429
[whispering] Oh. well. they're
coming this way. get down.

537
00:29:00.826 --> 00:29:02.131
You think he saw us?

538
00:29:02.175 --> 00:29:03.829
No. I don't think so. That's--

539
00:29:03.872 --> 00:29:05.569
That's Larson. her son.
but I mean.

540
00:29:05.613 --> 00:29:07.136
he doesn't live at home anymore.

541
00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:08.137
[Aubrey]
What is he doing here?

542
00:29:08.181 --> 00:29:09.530
I don't know.

543
00:29:10.749 --> 00:29:12.359
-Let's go check it out.
-Okay.

544
00:29:40.256 --> 00:29:42.781
[footsteps approaching]

545
00:29:52.442 --> 00:29:54.575
-Can you see him?
-Oh. my gosh. There he is.

546
00:29:56.316 --> 00:29:58.840
[whispering] I don't think
he saw us yet.

547
00:29:58.884 --> 00:30:00.755
Okay. He's right there.
He's right there.

548
00:30:04.672 --> 00:30:07.022
Shoot! Someone's coming.
Come on. come on.
let's go. Come on.

549
00:30:21.297 --> 00:30:24.561
[whispering] Get down. get down.
Shh. I don't want my son to see.

550
00:30:26.999 --> 00:30:28.957
I'll be right back. sweetheart.

551
00:30:29.001 --> 00:30:29.958
Be right back.

552
00:30:37.531 --> 00:30:38.967
-[Larson] Where is it?
-[Winona] Where's what?

553
00:30:39.011 --> 00:30:40.055
[Larson]
Where's Dad's will?

554
00:30:40.099 --> 00:30:41.230
I know you know where it is.

555
00:30:43.102 --> 00:30:46.061
[indistinct chatter]

556
00:30:46.975 --> 00:30:48.759
[Aubrey]
Who is that guy?

557
00:30:48.803 --> 00:30:51.284
That's Foster. he's one
of the bartenders at the club.

558
00:30:52.154 --> 00:30:54.635
-What is he doing here?
-I don't know.

559
00:30:55.941 --> 00:30:59.292
-[Larson] You know what. you're
worthless. Just forget it!
-[Winona] Sweetheart.

560
00:31:00.989 --> 00:31:03.513
Oh. yeah. Just go to
your little. happy place. your--

561
00:31:03.557 --> 00:31:05.254
Whatever it is
you do these days.

562
00:31:11.957 --> 00:31:13.784
Dad's always been
an asshole to me.

563
00:31:13.828 --> 00:31:16.048
The least you can do
is go find that will.

564
00:31:19.703 --> 00:31:20.835
When I get home...

565
00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.446
...they'll be on my side.

566
00:31:33.021 --> 00:31:36.242
Come here. sugar.
It's time to play.

567
00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:38.722
Oh. my goodness.

568
00:31:38.766 --> 00:31:40.507
Did I see what
I thought I just saw?

569
00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:42.770
[chuckles] I think so.

570
00:31:42.813 --> 00:31:45.033
Mrs. Trudeau
doesn't seem too bereaved.

571
00:31:50.691 --> 00:31:51.953
[whispering] Alright. Let's go.

572
00:31:53.912 --> 00:31:56.915
[Aubrey]
Alright. Let me see
what's going on here.

573
00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:02.268
-Can you see them?
-[Aubrey] Not yet.

574
00:32:02.311 --> 00:32:03.747
Oh. there's Foster.

575
00:32:04.792 --> 00:32:06.881
Alright. What is he up to?

576
00:32:10.319 --> 00:32:12.539
-[Dalton] What's he doing?
-[Aubrey] Oh.

577
00:32:12.582 --> 00:32:15.107
It looks like. um.
he's making them some drinks.

578
00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:16.369
Alright.

579
00:32:17.674 --> 00:32:19.459
[sighs] Where's Mrs. Trudeau?

580
00:32:21.026 --> 00:32:22.375
Oh. there she is!

581
00:32:23.332 --> 00:32:25.900
Looks like she's
in some sort of robe.

582
00:32:25.944 --> 00:32:26.945
Okay.

583
00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.469
Alright.

584
00:32:32.298 --> 00:32:36.606
Oh. looks like some
swaying and canoodling.

585
00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:39.566
-Canoodling?
-You know. like fun cuddling.

586
00:32:39.609 --> 00:32:40.828
Just let me see.

587
00:32:45.311 --> 00:32:46.355
Oh.

588
00:32:48.618 --> 00:32:52.144
"Hello. bartender.
It's ever so hot.

589
00:32:52.187 --> 00:32:54.537
I'm burning up
just looking at you."

590
00:32:54.581 --> 00:32:56.975
"Oh. why yes. Mrs. Trudeau?

591
00:32:57.018 --> 00:33:00.152
I've got exactly
what you're thirsty for."

592
00:33:00.195 --> 00:33:03.851
"Oh. perfect.
But please call me Winona."

593
00:33:03.894 --> 00:33:05.853
Stop!

594
00:33:05.896 --> 00:33:07.376
Alright.

595
00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:10.336
Oh. Oh. jeez.

596
00:33:10.379 --> 00:33:11.815
She's really going for it.

597
00:33:13.165 --> 00:33:14.818
Oh. I don't think
I can watch this.

598
00:33:15.732 --> 00:33:17.778
I feel like
an unfortunate fly on the wall.

599
00:33:17.821 --> 00:33:19.606
-Let me see.
-No. No!

600
00:33:19.649 --> 00:33:21.521
-Dalton!
-I just don't want you
to see that.

601
00:33:21.564 --> 00:33:22.696
Just let me see.

602
00:33:24.915 --> 00:33:25.786
Oh.

603
00:33:27.005 --> 00:33:28.658
Yeah. Okay.

604
00:33:28.702 --> 00:33:30.617
Um. let's just get out of here.

605
00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:33.576
and you can check up on her
in the morning. Alright.

606
00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:48.678
[rock hits the window]

607
00:33:52.117 --> 00:33:53.031
[rock hits the window]

608
00:33:57.905 --> 00:33:59.037
[rock hits the window]

609
00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.346
[Grant whispering]
Hey. Did I wake you?

610
00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:06.609
No. What are you
doing here. Grant?

611
00:34:06.653 --> 00:34:09.177
I don't think you've thrown
rocks at my window
since we were. like. ten.

612
00:34:09.221 --> 00:34:10.918
I just want to talk.

613
00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.746
Cal said you are in trouble
but he won't say what.

614
00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:16.228
[scoffs] We're fine.
We're fixing it.

615
00:34:16.271 --> 00:34:18.186
You tell Cal to shut up!

616
00:34:19.187 --> 00:34:20.971
Come on. Why don't you trust me?

617
00:34:21.014 --> 00:34:23.277
I mean. we've been friends
since the fourth grade.

618
00:34:23.322 --> 00:34:25.498
and ever since we hit. like.

619
00:34:25.541 --> 00:34:27.587
puberty. you just
stopped talking to me.

620
00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:29.154
Come on. Charlotte.
What's going on?

621
00:34:29.197 --> 00:34:33.592
No. Grant. I don't need you.
Now go home!

622
00:34:33.636 --> 00:34:36.161
Charlotte! Charlotte!

623
00:34:37.945 --> 00:34:39.947
Charlotte Margaret Moon!

624
00:34:39.989 --> 00:34:43.123
Grant. only my mother
calls me by my full name.

625
00:34:43.168 --> 00:34:44.516
Now go home.

626
00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.693
-But--
-Go home.

627
00:34:55.614 --> 00:34:57.269
-Did you take your medicine?
-Yes.

628
00:34:57.312 --> 00:35:00.141
Alright. good. Uh. bathroom.
Did you use the bathroom?

629
00:35:00.185 --> 00:35:02.012
-Yeah.
-Alright.

630
00:35:02.056 --> 00:35:03.884
-[unintelligible yelling]
-Do you need some help?

631
00:35:03.927 --> 00:35:06.278
-[mumbles]
-Yeah. yeah. yeah. I got it.

632
00:35:20.379 --> 00:35:23.947
[mischievous music]

633
00:35:40.834 --> 00:35:41.878
[pants]

634
00:35:43.706 --> 00:35:44.925
Alright. That's good.

635
00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:48.494
Oh. oh.

636
00:35:48.537 --> 00:35:49.582
[grunts]

637
00:35:56.719 --> 00:36:00.462
-[Brynn mumbles]
-Alright. Let's. uh.
let's sit here for a second.

638
00:36:02.421 --> 00:36:03.378
Brynn.

639
00:36:05.163 --> 00:36:06.555
-Do you have your drink?
-Yes.

640
00:36:06.599 --> 00:36:08.383
Alright. good.

641
00:36:08.427 --> 00:36:10.211
I'm. uh. I'm gonna go
look at something real quick.

642
00:36:10.255 --> 00:36:13.780
-You... find some bugs.
-Okay.

643
00:36:18.872 --> 00:36:22.528
[mischievous music continues]

644
00:37:03.743 --> 00:37:06.354
Charlotte. what are you doing?

645
00:37:06.398 --> 00:37:08.226
I'm. uh. looking for bugs.

646
00:37:09.314 --> 00:37:10.663
Looks like there's none here.

647
00:37:11.925 --> 00:37:13.883
Come on. Brynn. Let's. uh.

648
00:37:13.927 --> 00:37:16.016
let's go look someplace else.

649
00:37:16.059 --> 00:37:19.889
Here. you can use
your binoculars
and look for some birds.

650
00:37:19.933 --> 00:37:21.717
-Okay.
-Alright.

651
00:37:21.761 --> 00:37:24.590
Just. uh. stay here
and I'll be right back.

652
00:37:28.376 --> 00:37:33.076
[mischievous music continues]

653
00:37:38.299 --> 00:37:39.257
[groans]

654
00:38:16.685 --> 00:38:18.818
You are so silly.

655
00:38:18.861 --> 00:38:20.515
[Charlotte]
Brynn. stay hidden.

656
00:38:20.559 --> 00:38:23.301
-You don't want
to scare the bugs.
-What?

657
00:38:23.344 --> 00:38:25.215
[Charlotte]
Brynn. uh. hand me your spade.

658
00:38:26.086 --> 00:38:27.870
The-- the tiny shovel
in your hand.

659
00:38:27.914 --> 00:38:29.176
Give it to me.

660
00:38:29.219 --> 00:38:30.133
Come on.

661
00:38:33.659 --> 00:38:34.964
Careful. careful.

662
00:38:35.008 --> 00:38:38.054
[mischievous music continues]

663
00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.277
Okay.

664
00:39:29.584 --> 00:39:31.543
Alright. Brynn. It's time to go.

665
00:40:00.006 --> 00:40:01.268
Mm.

666
00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:40.394
[peeing]

667
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:19.999
Well. hello there.

668
00:41:20.042 --> 00:41:23.089
Usually it's older men
on the golf course
staring in my windows.

669
00:41:23.132 --> 00:41:25.700
But this is a nice surprise.

670
00:41:25.744 --> 00:41:27.833
Have you come here
to comfort me?

671
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:31.097
I'm flattered.

672
00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:35.362
Usually I like a younger man's
attention. but. uh...

673
00:41:35.405 --> 00:41:39.932
...I think you might be
a little bit too young for me.

674
00:41:39.975 --> 00:41:42.064
Now. shoot before
I call your parents

675
00:41:42.108 --> 00:41:44.545
and tell them
what their precious little.
baby boy has been up to.

676
00:41:49.028 --> 00:41:50.899
[woman]
Don't tell me
there's such a thing.

677
00:41:53.423 --> 00:41:55.382
You mean the kind of like...

678
00:41:56.296 --> 00:42:01.214
[indistinct chatter]

679
00:42:02.824 --> 00:42:04.434
Hi. Mr. and Mrs. Carver.

680
00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:08.003
Good morning.
Judge Talbott. Mrs. Talbott.

681
00:42:08.047 --> 00:42:09.614
Ms. Wyatt. I love your hat.

682
00:42:13.052 --> 00:42:14.836
Is there anyone here
you don't know?

683
00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.883
Very few. But if your family
lived here as long as mine.

684
00:42:17.926 --> 00:42:21.234
you'd know everyone too.
or at least their business.

685
00:42:21.277 --> 00:42:22.888
Alright. well.
I'll be right back.

686
00:42:22.931 --> 00:42:24.672
I'm going to go
to the bathroom. Okay?

687
00:42:25.978 --> 00:42:29.459
-Hey. Sullivan. Hey. Birdie.
-Hi. Scarlet.

688
00:42:29.503 --> 00:42:32.027
I saw your boyfriend
running across the golf course
the other night.

689
00:42:32.071 --> 00:42:34.813
Shh! Don't tell on Cal.

690
00:42:34.856 --> 00:42:35.814
Morning. Mrs. Kelly.

691
00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:39.252
-Hello. Scarlet. How are you?
-[Scarlet] I'm good.

692
00:42:39.295 --> 00:42:40.775
Not sure I'm too hungry though.

693
00:42:40.819 --> 00:42:42.995
Especially after
hearing about Mr. Trudeau.

694
00:42:43.038 --> 00:42:45.737
Oh. I know.
Isn't that just so awful?

695
00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:47.347
Yes. It's hard to believe.

696
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:49.610
I just feel bad
for Mrs. Trudeau and Larson.

697
00:42:51.394 --> 00:42:54.354
Sullivan. how about you take
Birdie to get some more waffles?

698
00:42:54.397 --> 00:42:56.182
Okay. Mom. Come on. Birdie.

699
00:42:56.225 --> 00:42:58.576
Help me get lots of
whipped cream this time.

700
00:43:00.752 --> 00:43:05.539
-Sadly. I don't think
they'll be missing him much.
-Really?

701
00:43:05.583 --> 00:43:07.846
I'm not saying
Winona did him in.

702
00:43:07.889 --> 00:43:10.544
I think Harley is worth
more to her alive than dead.

703
00:43:10.588 --> 00:43:12.851
But they did
get into it pretty good

704
00:43:12.894 --> 00:43:15.941
at the club's cocktail party
the other evening.

705
00:43:15.984 --> 00:43:18.987
Oh. that party.
It was such a pretty sight.

706
00:43:19.031 --> 00:43:23.296
There were flowers
and candles and garden lights
around the tables.

707
00:43:23.339 --> 00:43:25.777
I took lots of pictures
and I had a--

708
00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:28.823
You were-- you were
saying about the Trudeaus?

709
00:43:28.867 --> 00:43:33.480
Oh. yes. So-- so. toward the end
of the night. um. about ten.

710
00:43:33.523 --> 00:43:37.702
they took off on their golf
cart. just ranting and raving.

711
00:43:37.745 --> 00:43:39.442
From what I hear.

712
00:43:39.486 --> 00:43:43.446
their son Larson is a bit
of a spender and a gambler.

713
00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:46.101
He and his daddy used
to argue quite a bit about it.

714
00:43:47.581 --> 00:43:51.150
Wouldn't surprise me
if Larson did him in.

715
00:43:51.193 --> 00:43:53.326
He's got a temper on him.

716
00:43:53.369 --> 00:43:54.632
Kind of like his daddy.

717
00:44:06.818 --> 00:44:08.341
Hey. I'm back.

718
00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:13.433
I just heard Mrs. Kelly say
she took lots of pictures
of the club cocktail party.

719
00:44:13.476 --> 00:44:14.608
Really?

720
00:44:15.696 --> 00:44:16.654
Mm.

721
00:44:19.874 --> 00:44:20.745
[Scarlet]
Be right back.

722
00:44:28.274 --> 00:44:30.972
[man]
Can you check on--
can you check on my jacket?

723
00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:37.457
[indistinct chatter]

724
00:44:55.954 --> 00:44:56.998
[clears throat]

725
00:45:12.797 --> 00:45:17.192
Well. I for one.
won't be missing that man's
big mouth around the club.

726
00:45:17.236 --> 00:45:18.977
Ranger. my ass.

727
00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:20.892
I don't know. Colonel.

728
00:45:20.935 --> 00:45:22.850
Mr. Trudeau had some
pretty good war stories.

729
00:45:23.938 --> 00:45:27.507
I'm telling you.
there's no way he served.

730
00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:31.511
I served for 30 years. 30 years!

731
00:45:31.554 --> 00:45:34.035
Trust me. he's an impostor.

732
00:45:34.906 --> 00:45:37.038
His tales' as tall as my boat.

733
00:45:39.084 --> 00:45:41.260
I expect you're right. Colonel.

734
00:45:41.303 --> 00:45:43.653
Now. Carlos.
one of the groundskeepers.

735
00:45:43.697 --> 00:45:46.569
says the same thing.
You know he served?

736
00:45:46.613 --> 00:45:49.442
Yes. I do.
Now that's a good soldier.

737
00:45:50.791 --> 00:45:53.446
There's nothing burns me up more

738
00:45:53.489 --> 00:45:55.709
than a prideful bastard

739
00:45:55.753 --> 00:46:00.235
who steals somebody's respect
and glory who rightfully served.

740
00:46:01.236 --> 00:46:04.326
Carlos said he often had
run ins with Mr. Trudeau.

741
00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:06.720
especially at night
on the golf course.

742
00:46:06.764 --> 00:46:08.809
You catch him out there
drinking. pissing.

743
00:46:08.853 --> 00:46:10.811
tosses empties on the greens.

744
00:46:10.855 --> 00:46:13.814
-You believe that?
-Yeah. I believe it.

745
00:46:16.948 --> 00:46:20.734
Why Winona ever hooked up
with a guy like that?

746
00:46:22.127 --> 00:46:23.389
I'd never know.

747
00:46:25.391 --> 00:46:26.784
She deserves better.

748
00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:31.614
I agree. Colonel. I agree.

749
00:46:34.487 --> 00:46:36.228
Let me check
on that breakfast for you.

750
00:46:41.886 --> 00:46:44.192
You are not gonna believe
what I just heard.

751
00:46:44.236 --> 00:46:46.542
Well. you're not gonna
believe what I just did.

752
00:46:47.587 --> 00:46:51.156
I AirDropped her pictures
from the club cocktail party
to my phone.

753
00:46:51.199 --> 00:46:52.940
You are so awesome.

754
00:46:52.984 --> 00:46:55.638
I know. Let's get out of here.

755
00:46:55.682 --> 00:46:57.945
We gotta go visit
my mom at the bank.

756
00:46:57.989 --> 00:47:01.949
[indistinct chatter]

757
00:47:01.993 --> 00:47:06.432
[upbeat music]

758
00:47:14.048 --> 00:47:15.528
Hey. Gina. Going for me?

759
00:47:16.572 --> 00:47:18.183
-No.
-Ouch.

760
00:47:22.578 --> 00:47:23.536
Hey. Char.

761
00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:36.201
Well. hello. lovely lady.

762
00:47:36.244 --> 00:47:39.073
-You come here often?
-Hello. Cal.

763
00:47:39.117 --> 00:47:41.510
Hi. Finn. I see you
both recovered.

764
00:47:41.554 --> 00:47:45.166
Oh. no. The emotional
scars still there.

765
00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:47.690
Well. I'm glad
to hear you're a survivor.

766
00:47:47.734 --> 00:47:50.084
Yeah. And Mom's got me
on a short leash now.

767
00:47:50.128 --> 00:47:52.130
-Thank you very much.
-Yeah.

768
00:47:52.173 --> 00:47:54.872
But I really do
appreciate the sacrifice.

769
00:47:54.915 --> 00:47:57.439
You should. because now he's
grounded from his girlfriend

770
00:47:57.483 --> 00:48:02.009
and other unsuitable
influences...
[coughs] Charlotte.

771
00:48:02.053 --> 00:48:05.883
Uh-huh. Cal.
you have a big mouth.

772
00:48:05.926 --> 00:48:08.537
Yeah. I know.
Anyways. enough chatter.

773
00:48:08.581 --> 00:48:12.454
You want to play some
touch football with us?

774
00:48:12.498 --> 00:48:15.849
No. thanks. I don't want
to touch you at all. you freak.

775
00:48:15.893 --> 00:48:17.503
Anchors aweigh!

776
00:48:17.546 --> 00:48:20.071
-[water splashing]
-Cannonball!

777
00:48:23.683 --> 00:48:26.642
Hey! You know what?
Cal. you're a real gentleman.

778
00:48:26.686 --> 00:48:28.906
Scarlet will be so pleased you
treat her best friend like this.

779
00:48:28.949 --> 00:48:30.690
I don't know why she dates you!

780
00:49:03.462 --> 00:49:06.465
Hey. kid.
you're in my personal space.

781
00:49:07.509 --> 00:49:08.423
Yeah.

782
00:49:09.642 --> 00:49:12.297
-Hey.
-Oh. I don't like.

783
00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:15.778
Hey. don't mind her.
Getting your space is
her way of being friendly.

784
00:49:15.822 --> 00:49:16.954
She's autistic.

785
00:49:18.216 --> 00:49:19.521
Uh-huh.

786
00:49:21.045 --> 00:49:23.047
Hey. Larson.

787
00:49:23.090 --> 00:49:24.874
So. can I get you anything?

788
00:49:24.918 --> 00:49:27.616
-I got soda. beer...
-[Larson] No. thanks.

789
00:49:36.016 --> 00:49:38.410
Oh. you can get me something.

790
00:49:39.324 --> 00:49:41.804
Or am I too poor?

791
00:49:54.165 --> 00:49:55.079
Hello.

792
00:49:58.082 --> 00:49:59.431
I said not to call.

793
00:50:02.042 --> 00:50:03.130
I will get it.

794
00:50:04.088 --> 00:50:05.611
Dude. I will get it.

795
00:50:08.005 --> 00:50:09.267
Stop calling me!

796
00:50:20.713 --> 00:50:22.454
Come on. Jill. let's go.

797
00:50:22.497 --> 00:50:24.412
Babe. we just got here.

798
00:50:24.456 --> 00:50:27.111
-Jill. now. come on. let's go.
-Okay. Just give me one second.

799
00:50:29.113 --> 00:50:30.810
I hate when you're so grouchy.

800
00:50:52.049 --> 00:50:54.094
[exhales] She's fine.

801
00:50:54.138 --> 00:50:55.661
She's tough.

802
00:50:55.704 --> 00:50:58.359
I just took my eyes off her
for a second.

803
00:50:58.403 --> 00:51:00.100
Come on. Brynn.

804
00:51:00.144 --> 00:51:03.669
-Ow!
-It can happen fast.
That's why I'm here.

805
00:51:03.712 --> 00:51:05.105
-Okay.
-[Vonne] Hey. Hey. Brynn.

806
00:51:05.149 --> 00:51:07.281
Uh. you swallowed any water?

807
00:51:08.543 --> 00:51:10.415
-What?
-You swallowed any water?

808
00:51:10.458 --> 00:51:12.808
-No.
-Um...

809
00:51:12.852 --> 00:51:15.028
-What's your name?
-Brynn.

810
00:51:15.072 --> 00:51:16.769
[Vonne]
How many fingers
am I holding up. Brynn?

811
00:51:16.812 --> 00:51:18.771
-Three.
-High five.

812
00:51:20.512 --> 00:51:22.296
[sighs]

813
00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:24.777
Come on. Brynn. I think that's
enough swimming for today.

814
00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:28.476
Hey. When you see Dalton
with your sister.
tell him to call me.

815
00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:30.652
I want to go later for pizza.

816
00:51:30.696 --> 00:51:33.307
That is if you can pull him
somewhere away from
his girlfriend.

817
00:51:33.351 --> 00:51:34.569
Yeah. Okay.

818
00:51:38.312 --> 00:51:40.227
Later. loser!

819
00:51:40.271 --> 00:51:41.620
[Brynn laughs]

820
00:51:41.663 --> 00:51:43.056
-Come on. Brynn.
-[Brynn] Okay.

821
00:51:46.233 --> 00:51:49.018
Wow. Brynn and you were
busy little detectives. huh?

822
00:51:49.062 --> 00:51:51.456
[chuckles] I admit
it was pretty cool.

823
00:51:51.499 --> 00:51:54.502
Uh. this is everyone we have
in our suspect list so far.

824
00:51:54.546 --> 00:51:56.243
[Cal]
Hey. guys.

825
00:51:56.287 --> 00:51:58.158
Did you guys
solve the murder yet?

826
00:51:58.202 --> 00:51:59.725
Glad you could join us. Cal.

827
00:51:59.768 --> 00:52:01.944
I'm on parole.
So. it's good to be here.

828
00:52:01.988 --> 00:52:04.164
Alright. So based on what
I found in the golf course.

829
00:52:04.208 --> 00:52:06.993
it seems that Harley
was killed in the sand trap

830
00:52:07.036 --> 00:52:09.256
and had his body dragged
into the cove.

831
00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:12.346
Yeah. I think you're right.
But who on your list
could have done that?

832
00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:15.088
-Not Winona.
-But Winona has a motive.

833
00:52:15.132 --> 00:52:19.092
We saw her come home
all liquored up and happy
with a bartender from the club.

834
00:52:19.136 --> 00:52:20.876
Yeah. Foster Davis.

835
00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:23.618
-Foster is a friend of Tanner's.
-Mm.

836
00:52:24.663 --> 00:52:26.926
[Roxi]
So. they're having an affair?

837
00:52:28.057 --> 00:52:30.669
Foster is known to be a favorite
with the club cougars.

838
00:52:30.712 --> 00:52:33.889
I think I might be a favorite
with the club cougars.

839
00:52:33.933 --> 00:52:37.154
-Winona caught me outside
her house this morning.
-[all] What?

840
00:52:37.197 --> 00:52:39.417
Yeah. I thought she was
gonna pull Mrs. Robinson on me.

841
00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:42.550
-[girls] Ew!
-Yeah. but she saw me packing
this. It was alright.

842
00:52:42.594 --> 00:52:45.553
That earring that Charlotte
found in the sand trap
could be hers.

843
00:52:45.597 --> 00:52:48.556
Mrs. Kelly doesn't think
Winona would kill Harley.

844
00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:50.558
He was worth more
to her alive than dead.

845
00:52:50.602 --> 00:52:52.081
And it definitely wasn't Foster.

846
00:52:52.125 --> 00:52:53.648
I mean. he might
entertain wealthy women.

847
00:52:53.692 --> 00:52:56.129
but he definitely
would not kill for them.

848
00:52:56.173 --> 00:52:59.480
Well. unless they have alibis.
they're staying on the list.

849
00:52:59.524 --> 00:53:02.527
Ms. Kelly does see
their son Larson doing it.

850
00:53:02.570 --> 00:53:05.704
He's known for his temper
and blowing off his money.

851
00:53:05.747 --> 00:53:08.141
-That earring could
be his fiancée's.
-Yeah.

852
00:53:08.185 --> 00:53:10.926
And the other day at the pool.
I heard him take a phone call.

853
00:53:10.970 --> 00:53:13.712
He seemed really mad about it.
Something about money.

854
00:53:13.755 --> 00:53:16.105
-The Colonel was
mad at brunch today.
-Yeah.

855
00:53:16.149 --> 00:53:20.632
I guess Harley boasted
at the club that he was
a part of the Army Rangers.

856
00:53:20.675 --> 00:53:22.938
The Colonel didn't believe it.
called Harley a liar.

857
00:53:22.982 --> 00:53:25.027
Veterans could take
a serious offense to fakes.

858
00:53:25.071 --> 00:53:28.596
It's called "stolen valor."
It can even get violent.

859
00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:32.383
Well. it sounds like
the Colonel is going to
be added to our list too.

860
00:53:32.426 --> 00:53:34.950
Wait. Well. what about
the fights between Harley

861
00:53:34.994 --> 00:53:37.170
-and the greenskeeper?
-Carlos?

862
00:53:37.214 --> 00:53:39.520
Yeah. he lives in a trailer
behind the ninth hole.

863
00:53:39.564 --> 00:53:43.002
He would have been
on the greens that night
because he patrols it.

864
00:53:43.045 --> 00:53:44.395
I don't see him
killing some rich asshole

865
00:53:44.438 --> 00:53:45.744
just because
he let him get to him.

866
00:53:45.787 --> 00:53:47.789
No. Put him on the list.

867
00:53:47.833 --> 00:53:50.009
There are times
where I'm sneaking across
the golf course at night

868
00:53:50.052 --> 00:53:52.403
to Scarlet's house
and he chases me.

869
00:53:52.446 --> 00:53:54.753
You know. Ms. Kelly said

870
00:53:54.796 --> 00:53:57.930
the Trudeaus were
at the club cocktail party
the night Harley died.

871
00:53:57.973 --> 00:54:01.760
She said they got in a fight
and left together on their
golf cart about ten.

872
00:54:01.803 --> 00:54:04.110
-Oh. I got their party pics.
-Awesome.

873
00:54:06.504 --> 00:54:09.028
Yeah. It looks like
all our suspects were there.

874
00:54:10.551 --> 00:54:13.206
Yeah. And all of them drive
their own carts to the parties.

875
00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:16.818
Yeah. or in Foster's case.
have access to carts.

876
00:54:16.862 --> 00:54:19.691
Scarlet and I went
to my mom's office at the bank.

877
00:54:19.734 --> 00:54:23.260
I'd say Harley doesn't look
like he's hurting for money.

878
00:54:23.303 --> 00:54:27.481
My dad said Harley
and his business partner
had a pretty good relationship.

879
00:54:27.525 --> 00:54:29.875
Alright. we'll take
them off the list for now.

880
00:54:32.486 --> 00:54:35.576
So that leaves us
with Winona. Larson and Jill.

881
00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:37.970
Foster. The Colonel and Carlos.

882
00:54:38.013 --> 00:54:41.408
Well. we do know what time
Harley and Winona
left the party.

883
00:54:41.452 --> 00:54:43.715
Yeah. So. Scarlet.
go back to Ms. Kelly's

884
00:54:43.758 --> 00:54:46.457
and ask her what time all
the other guests left the party.

885
00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:48.676
-Maybe she'll know.
-Oh. she'll know.

886
00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:51.984
When she gets a babysitter. she
stays out as late as she can.

887
00:54:52.027 --> 00:54:55.030
So. we just have to find out
what each suspect was doing

888
00:54:55.074 --> 00:54:57.468
from the time that the Trudeaus
left the party at ten.

889
00:54:57.511 --> 00:55:00.209
and when we found
Harley's body at 12:30.

890
00:55:00.253 --> 00:55:04.475
-Uh. Roxi. do you want
to stake out Carlos with me?
-Sure.

891
00:55:04.518 --> 00:55:07.565
Don't you have a friend
in a lab or something?

892
00:55:07.608 --> 00:55:10.350
Oh. my cousin. Stacy.
She works at a gene lab.

893
00:55:10.394 --> 00:55:12.352
Cool. Do you think
she can run a test on this

894
00:55:12.396 --> 00:55:14.398
and see if it's
a match to Harley?

895
00:55:14.441 --> 00:55:16.400
Sure. She's cool.

896
00:55:17.836 --> 00:55:20.099
And. uh. can you two
follow up on Winona?

897
00:55:20.142 --> 00:55:21.753
Oh. I can't.

898
00:55:21.796 --> 00:55:23.755
I gotta go to the barn
tomorrow and then to work.

899
00:55:24.712 --> 00:55:27.019
Well. I guess
it's just you. Dalton.

900
00:55:27.062 --> 00:55:29.369
-You take Winona.
-Take her where?

901
00:55:29.413 --> 00:55:32.372
Cinderella's ball.
Hello? Are you listening?

902
00:55:32.416 --> 00:55:34.200
Oh. yeah. sorry.
I'm-- I'm just hungry.

903
00:55:34.243 --> 00:55:35.723
I'm actually gonna
go meet Vonne for pizza.

904
00:55:35.767 --> 00:55:37.595
-so I'll see y'all later.
-Wait. Dalton.

905
00:55:37.638 --> 00:55:39.248
I thought we were gonna
get dinner together.

906
00:55:39.292 --> 00:55:40.772
[Dalton]
Oh. no. it's bro time.

907
00:55:40.815 --> 00:55:42.339
and I gotta talk to him
about the Jet Ski.

908
00:55:44.428 --> 00:55:48.040
Can we have snacks at our next
meeting of the minds please?

909
00:55:48.083 --> 00:55:49.955
Hello? Focus!

910
00:55:49.998 --> 00:55:52.784
Alright. I'm-- I'll
take Larson and the fiancée.

911
00:55:52.827 --> 00:55:55.613
Jill works at the wine store
next to the coffee shop.

912
00:55:55.656 --> 00:55:58.093
They come in
after she's done. around two.

913
00:55:58.137 --> 00:56:00.835
Great. Um. I can go over there
and see if they drop any clues.

914
00:56:00.879 --> 00:56:03.708
Scarlet. um. you talk to Tanner.
see if he can. I don't know.

915
00:56:03.751 --> 00:56:06.885
"bro talk" Foster into
telling him what's up
with him and Winona.

916
00:56:06.928 --> 00:56:09.104
Okay. I can talk
to the Colonel too.

917
00:56:09.148 --> 00:56:11.063
-He's friends with my dad.
-Great.

918
00:56:11.106 --> 00:56:13.021
[claps] Excellent. we're done.

919
00:56:13.065 --> 00:56:16.242
Okay. Dance off time.
us two versus you two. You in?

920
00:56:16.285 --> 00:56:18.462
You two are on. Come on. Char.

921
00:56:21.595 --> 00:56:24.642
[upbeat Latin dance music]

922
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:29.298
Ew. Could you pick
a cleaner hiding spot?

923
00:56:29.342 --> 00:56:31.083
No. We have to hide!

924
00:56:31.126 --> 00:56:33.999
-[groans]
-And. you know.
blend with nature.

925
00:56:34.042 --> 00:56:36.828
Well. I don't want
to be one with nature.

926
00:56:36.871 --> 00:56:38.960
You know nature and I
don't mix very well.

927
00:56:39.004 --> 00:56:41.572
I know. but you're also
one of my very best friends

928
00:56:41.615 --> 00:56:43.878
who'll do anything
to support me.

929
00:56:43.922 --> 00:56:45.053
This is true.

930
00:56:47.708 --> 00:56:51.320
Oh. This maintenance cart
doesn't seem to have
any damage to it.

931
00:56:52.626 --> 00:56:56.021
It is so romantic to see a guy
speaking softly in Spanish.

932
00:56:56.935 --> 00:56:59.633
[singing in Spanish]

933
00:56:59.677 --> 00:57:00.808
Here comes Carlos.

934
00:57:02.593 --> 00:57:05.857
[groans] I can't tell
what he's saying
but he seems really upset.

935
00:57:06.901 --> 00:57:10.601
[speaking in Spanish]

936
00:57:10.644 --> 00:57:14.735
"I'm telling you. man.
stuff keeps going
missing around here."

937
00:57:14.779 --> 00:57:16.476
[speaking in Spanish]

938
00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:19.653
"I get up the next morning.
and more parts are gone."

939
00:57:19.697 --> 00:57:21.481
[Carlos speaking in Spanish]

940
00:57:21.525 --> 00:57:24.571
"I'll never get this Chevy
running again at this rate."

[speaking in Spanish]

942
00:57:26.617 --> 00:57:27.966
"You got to see my golf cart."

943

[Carlos groans]
Bro...

-[Roxi] "Bro. I'm totally
messed it up."

00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:40.544
"I hit him so hard.

947
00:57:40.587 --> 00:57:42.763
There was blood everywhere."

948
00:57:42.807 --> 00:57:44.504
Holy sugar. Roxi!

Hey. who's there?

[Latin dance music continues]

955

-[Charlotte] Hey. Gigi.
-[Roxi] Later. Grant.

956
00:58:10.182 --> 00:58:12.271
I know what
you're up to. Charlotte.

957
00:58:12.314 --> 00:58:14.839
If you think
Cal didn't tell me.
you're crazier than you look.

958
00:58:18.277 --> 00:58:19.713
[both panting]

959
00:58:19.757 --> 00:58:21.367
Carlos made it passed the dog.

960
00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:22.673
-Thank God.
-Good.

961
00:58:26.067 --> 00:58:29.680
-Oh! It's your crush.
-Shh!

962
00:58:29.723 --> 00:58:33.118
Hey. Char.
What are you two doing?

963
00:58:33.161 --> 00:58:34.380
Running from the boogeyman?

964
00:58:34.423 --> 00:58:36.338
[laughs] Good one!

965
00:58:36.382 --> 00:58:37.557
What are you doing around here?

966
00:58:37.601 --> 00:58:38.993
I was just over at Dalton's.

967
00:58:39.037 --> 00:58:41.561
He and I are going in
on a Jet Ski.

968
00:58:41.605 --> 00:58:43.345
Cool. Those are fun.

969
00:58:43.389 --> 00:58:45.652
You want a ride?
Drop you off at Char's house.

970

00:59:12.897 --> 00:59:15.073
-Yeah. Mom?
-Oh. it's almost ten.

974
00:59:15.116 --> 00:59:17.945
I've got to go
show a couple homes.
but I'll be back by lunch.

975
00:59:17.989 --> 00:59:20.034
-Okay. Mom.
-Oh. Charlotte.

976
00:59:20.078 --> 00:59:21.470
While I was at the ship's store.

977
00:59:21.514 --> 00:59:22.689
I signed you up
for sailing lessons.

978
00:59:22.733 --> 00:59:24.169
I mean. they were pretty full.

979
00:59:24.212 --> 00:59:25.736
but they had this
last minute cancellation.

980
00:59:25.779 --> 00:59:27.912
-so I was able to get you in.
-[scoffs] Mom.

981

What did I tell you
about signing me up for things?

982
00:59:30.088 --> 00:59:31.916
Oh. Come on. Charlotte.

983
00:59:31.959 --> 00:59:33.831
You know
how much I love sailing.

984
00:59:33.874 --> 00:59:35.963
and just like Jane Aubrey.
I want you to learn.

985
00:59:36.007 --> 00:59:38.139
Alright. but am I going
to be in a group lesson

986
00:59:38.183 --> 00:59:39.793
with a bunch of little kids?

987
00:59:39.837 --> 00:59:42.448
Mm. No worries. I signed
you up for private lessons.

988
00:59:42.491 --> 00:59:45.494
Okay. Is. uh. is Jay coming
home for the weekend?

989
00:59:45.538 --> 00:59:46.626
I haven't seen him all summer.

990

classes all summer long.

-Bye. I love you too.

So glad Mama is gone.

996
01:00:01.859 --> 01:00:04.731
I don't want to face her until
after this craziness is over.

997
01:00:04.775 --> 01:00:08.909
Well. that'll be hard.
Mom wants us to go to
the country club's next party.

998

Oh. yeah. Dalton promised
we'd go together.

ditching me a lot.
but hope it will be fun.

01:00:14.959 --> 01:00:16.656
No... [scoffs] it won't.

1001
01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:18.919
Ah. cheer up. sis!

1002
01:00:18.963 --> 01:00:22.531
Oh. um. Carlos chased me
and Roxi last night.

1003
01:00:22.575 --> 01:00:25.360
-He's looking very suspicious.
-He chased you?

1004
01:00:25.404 --> 01:00:26.623
[phone beeping]

1005
01:00:29.582 --> 01:00:32.585
Scarlet texted the list
of the times our suspects
left the party.

1006
01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:35.240
According to Ms. Kelly.
the Trudeaus left about ten.

1007
01:00:35.283 --> 01:00:40.375
The Colonel at 10:30. and Larson
and his fiancée around 10:45.

1008
01:00:40.419 --> 01:00:42.900
Mrs. Kelly stayed
till the party ended at 11.

1009
01:00:42.943 --> 01:00:44.815
And as she was walking home.
she saw Foster

1010
01:00:44.858 --> 01:00:47.295
driving out of the neighborhood
about 11:15.

1011
01:00:47.339 --> 01:00:50.472
So. does that mean
Foster is off the suspect list?

1012
01:00:50.516 --> 01:00:53.258
No. because
he just could come back.

1013
01:00:53.301 --> 01:00:56.043
Hopefully Tanner has
something to tell us today.

1014
01:00:56.087 --> 01:00:58.263
Well. tell me about Carlos.

1015
01:00:58.306 --> 01:01:01.527
But you have to hurry it up.
I got to get to the barn soon.

1016
01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:05.879
Well. it was both terrifying
and fun all at the same time.

1017
01:01:05.923 --> 01:01:09.274
-But I'll tell you everything
once everyone's here tonight.
-Okay.

1018
01:01:11.537 --> 01:01:13.626
Hey. Get a load of this.

1019
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:15.584
"Chief Graham still
investigating the death

1020
01:01:15.628 --> 01:01:18.413
of prominent local lawyer
Harley Trudeau.

1021
01:01:18.457 --> 01:01:20.633
Mr. Trudeau's body
was found in a cove

1022
01:01:20.677 --> 01:01:23.854
along The Queen's Crown Golf
Course early Sunday morning.

1023
01:01:23.897 --> 01:01:26.857
Mr. Trudeau is believed
to have passed sometime between

1024
01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:29.555
11 p.m. and 1:00 a.m. Saturday.

1025
01:01:29.598 --> 01:01:33.080
Few details have been released
regarding the suspicious death.

1026
01:01:33.124 --> 01:01:35.343
but Mr. Trudeau appears
to have been the victim

1027
01:01:35.387 --> 01:01:37.737
of a hit and run
by a small vehicle.

1028
01:01:37.781 --> 01:01:41.349
Sources also report
a resident of the exclusive
neighborhood came forward

1029
01:01:41.393 --> 01:01:43.177
saying he was out late
walking the court

1030
01:01:43.221 --> 01:01:45.702
sometime around midnight
on the night in question

1031
01:01:45.745 --> 01:01:49.793
when he saw a unicorn
chasing a white fox."

1032
01:01:49.836 --> 01:01:51.751
-Brynn and Muffin.
-Brynn and Muffin.

1033
01:01:51.795 --> 01:01:53.274
"This is a curious case indeed.

1034
01:01:53.318 --> 01:01:55.233
The investigation is ongoing."

1035
01:01:55.276 --> 01:01:58.149
Well... no news is good news.

1036
01:01:58.192 --> 01:02:00.629
They haven't said
anything about you... yet.

1037
01:02:00.673 --> 01:02:02.762
[sighs]

1038
01:02:02.806 --> 01:02:05.852
[engine rumbling]

1039
01:02:08.681 --> 01:02:11.292
-Hey there.
-Hey. This cart's kinda flat.

1040
01:02:11.336 --> 01:02:13.425
I keep filling it up
but it just gets slow again.

1041
01:02:13.468 --> 01:02:14.905
Maybe you should
go get cart two.

1042
01:02:14.948 --> 01:02:16.776
It's fine.
I'll fill it when I come back.

1043
01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:19.387
No. um. you should
probably go get cart two.

1044
01:02:19.431 --> 01:02:20.519
[groans]

1045
01:02:20.562 --> 01:02:21.912
[Dalton]
Are you alright?

1046
01:02:21.955 --> 01:02:22.869
[Gina]
I'm not sure.

1047
01:02:22.913 --> 01:02:24.653
It's just really hot.

1048
01:02:24.697 --> 01:02:26.394
Are you gonna be okay to work?

1049
01:02:27.569 --> 01:02:29.833
So kind of you to worry.

1050
01:02:29.876 --> 01:02:31.748
Well. now I'm afraid
to let you go.

1051
01:02:31.791 --> 01:02:33.575
Then don't.

1052
01:02:33.619 --> 01:02:35.926
Admit it. you want me.

1053
01:02:37.971 --> 01:02:41.148
Dalton. make no mistake.

1054
01:02:41.192 --> 01:02:45.631
I'm a woman
and I'm nothing like that little
teenybopper girlfriend of yours.

1055
01:02:46.501 --> 01:02:48.373
So the question is...

1056
01:02:48.416 --> 01:02:50.810
...is the man in you
ready for me?

1057
01:02:50.854 --> 01:02:52.943
I think I'd like to find out.

1058
01:02:52.986 --> 01:02:56.598
And the little princess.
you'd dump her for me. right?

1059
01:02:56.642 --> 01:02:57.556
Maybe.

1060
01:03:00.646 --> 01:03:04.432
[Gina]
So. why did you do this job
when I hear you're rich?

1061
01:03:05.303 --> 01:03:07.087
My parents have money. not me.

1062
01:03:07.131 --> 01:03:09.220
And I'd say we're well-off.

1063
01:03:09.263 --> 01:03:11.048
Plus. rich is relative.

1064
01:03:12.353 --> 01:03:14.834
Well. relative to me.
you're rich.

1065
01:03:14.878 --> 01:03:16.618
Well. I'm not a trust fund kid.

1066
01:03:16.662 --> 01:03:18.403
I have to make my own way
like my dad did.

1067
01:03:18.446 --> 01:03:21.319
Oh. How boring.

1068
01:03:21.362 --> 01:03:23.930
And here I was
briefly interested in you.

1069
01:03:25.062 --> 01:03:26.063
[Dalton scoffs]

1070
01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:29.457
[engine rumbling]

1071
01:03:30.328 --> 01:03:31.808
Hey. buddy.

1072
01:03:31.851 --> 01:03:33.853
Oh. Uh. hey. what's the word?

1073
01:03:34.941 --> 01:03:38.031
The word... spider.

1074
01:03:38.075 --> 01:03:39.685
Just don't get caught up
in her web.

1075
01:03:44.081 --> 01:03:46.910
[soft music playing]

1076
01:03:46.953 --> 01:03:50.522
Hey. Foster. Nice to see you.

1077
01:03:50.565 --> 01:03:53.264
Hey. long time. man.

1078
01:03:53.307 --> 01:03:54.874
What you been up to?

1079
01:03:54.918 --> 01:03:56.702
I hope you ain't been
working all the time.

1080
01:03:56.745 --> 01:03:59.923
I've been squeezing in
time for fun. you know me.

1081
01:03:59.966 --> 01:04:02.055
Yeah. [chuckling] Yeah. I do.

1082
01:04:02.099 --> 01:04:04.362
Ever since you dated
my sister in high school.

1083
01:04:04.405 --> 01:04:06.930
[chuckles softly] Yeah.
Ouch. Don't remind me.

1084
01:04:08.279 --> 01:04:10.803
You know. high school is
further back for me than you.

1085
01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:15.112
Well. uh. speaking matters
of the heart and. uh...

1086
01:04:15.155 --> 01:04:16.504
...other body parts...

1087
01:04:18.202 --> 01:04:21.031
...heard you and Ms. Trudeau
are an item.

1088
01:04:21.074 --> 01:04:23.468
Uh. where'd you hear that?

1089
01:04:25.339 --> 01:04:27.211
The winds of gossip.

1090
01:04:27.254 --> 01:04:28.473
Isn't that true?

1091
01:04:28.516 --> 01:04:31.911
Yeah. Yeah. that's true.

1092
01:04:31.955 --> 01:04:34.827
Been going on for. uh.
a few months now.

1093
01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:37.874
I mean. it's nothing
serious. but. uh.

1094
01:04:37.917 --> 01:04:39.571
don't tell anyone. Alright?

1095
01:04:39.614 --> 01:04:41.921
[chuckles] Dude.

1096
01:04:41.965 --> 01:04:43.314
What's up with that?

1097
01:04:43.357 --> 01:04:45.577
She's got. like. what.
25 years on you.

1098
01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:46.970
What can I say?

1099
01:04:47.013 --> 01:04:49.624
I mean.
she was offering and really.

1100
01:04:49.668 --> 01:04:51.713
you know. she's a blast.

1101
01:04:51.757 --> 01:04:52.845
Okay.

1102
01:04:55.239 --> 01:04:59.025
And what about her. uh.
husband's suspicious death?

1103
01:04:59.069 --> 01:05:00.418
That don't worry you now?

1104
01:05:01.375 --> 01:05:04.030
Nah. she's a genuine sweetie.

1105
01:05:04.074 --> 01:05:06.119
I've known some sly women.

1106
01:05:06.163 --> 01:05:07.468
She's not one of them.

1107
01:05:09.253 --> 01:05:11.995
It's weird though... her husband
winding up in the lake

1108
01:05:12.038 --> 01:05:13.735
while she's waiting
for me in my place.

1109
01:05:15.259 --> 01:05:16.651
You sure about that?

1110
01:05:16.695 --> 01:05:18.740
Yeah. man. I mean...

1111
01:05:18.784 --> 01:05:20.873
...Winona and Harley
left the club cocktail party.

1112
01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:22.440
uh. about ten or so.

1113
01:05:22.483 --> 01:05:24.790
You know.
same time I sent Gina home.

1114
01:05:24.833 --> 01:05:27.924
By 10:25. she was sending me
pics from my condo.

1115
01:05:29.447 --> 01:05:30.752
Check these out.

1116
01:05:34.017 --> 01:05:35.322
You see the time stamp?

1117
01:05:36.976 --> 01:05:39.196
You know. they estimate Harley's
time of death after 11. So...

1118
01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:43.287
Besides. Chief Bud
found Harley's golf cart
back at the club.

1119
01:05:43.330 --> 01:05:45.332
Not a scratch on it.

1120
01:05:45.376 --> 01:05:46.420
True.

1121
01:05:48.466 --> 01:05:50.076
So you just went
right home after work?

1122
01:05:51.512 --> 01:05:52.731
Yeah. briefly.

1123
01:05:54.646 --> 01:05:58.041
[chuckles nervously] You're
asking all this officially
or unofficially?

1124
01:05:58.084 --> 01:06:00.565
Unofficially. Of course.

1125
01:06:00.608 --> 01:06:01.914
Of course.

1126
01:06:03.785 --> 01:06:06.963
Well. I'll tell you the same
thing I told Chief Bud. Yeah.

1127
01:06:07.006 --> 01:06:10.444
Got home 11:20.
changed. then. uh...

1128
01:06:10.488 --> 01:06:12.533
...Winona and I went out
to the Chill Martini.

1129
01:06:12.577 --> 01:06:14.971
Got there about 20 to midnight.

1130
01:06:15.014 --> 01:06:16.755
When did you leave?

1131
01:06:16.798 --> 01:06:18.278
Stayed till closing at two.

1132
01:06:20.193 --> 01:06:23.022
You know. you ask a lot of these
unofficial questions. man.

1133
01:06:23.066 --> 01:06:25.372
[chuckles] No worries. man.

1134
01:06:25.416 --> 01:06:27.940
I-- just out of curiosity.

1135
01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:31.422
-Yeah.
-Chief Bud's working
the case. not me.

1136
01:06:31.465 --> 01:06:34.512
Ah. Yeah. Alright.
I doubt that. Tanner.

1137
01:06:34.555 --> 01:06:36.993
I mean. you're trying to
beat Chief Bud to the punch
on this?

1138
01:06:38.559 --> 01:06:41.954
I admit I'd like him to trust me
a little more. but. uh...

1139
01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:44.217
No. that's not it.

1140
01:06:46.045 --> 01:06:47.742
This is so unusual.

1141
01:06:47.786 --> 01:06:50.223
Harley dying out there
on the golf course like that.

1142
01:06:50.267 --> 01:06:53.531
Yeah. Well.
I'm not surprised. I mean...

1143
01:06:53.574 --> 01:06:57.187
Don't let these luxury homes
and manicured lawns fool you.

1144
01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:58.666
I see and hear plenty.

1145
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:05.630
Sure you do. my friend.

1146
01:07:06.674 --> 01:07:07.936
Sure you do.

1147
01:07:14.421 --> 01:07:16.945
Why do I keep letting you
talk me into this stuff?

1148
01:07:16.989 --> 01:07:20.253
Because I didn't want to go
alone. and you're my friend.

1149
01:07:20.297 --> 01:07:22.995
You torture me. Charlotte.
I felt a lot braver last night

1150
01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:24.127
when we were playing
Call of Duty.

1151
01:07:24.170 --> 01:07:26.042
but I'm just tired.

1152
01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:29.045
Here. Have my latte.

1153
01:07:32.439 --> 01:07:34.746
This is my payment
for being your bodyguard?

1154
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:37.575
-Half a latte?
-Do you want my cookie?

1155
01:07:39.533 --> 01:07:40.491
Yes.

1156
01:07:41.492 --> 01:07:43.189
So. what are we supposed to do?

1157
01:07:43.233 --> 01:07:45.844
Just talk and act like
we don't notice them.

1158
01:07:47.367 --> 01:07:50.153
-But what do we talk about?
-Same thing we always do.

1159
01:07:50.196 --> 01:07:52.546
You know. like video games.
skateboarding.

1160
01:07:52.590 --> 01:07:54.418
anime stuff-- Here they come.

1161
01:07:55.593 --> 01:07:57.595
You sure you'll be ready?
I mean...

1162
01:07:57.638 --> 01:07:59.945
-Maybe we just need to postpone.
-I'm fine. Jill.

1163
01:07:59.988 --> 01:08:01.425
We're not postponing.

1164
01:08:05.429 --> 01:08:08.171
My dad and I...
weren't close anymore.

1165
01:08:09.172 --> 01:08:11.391
Okay. if you say so.

1166
01:08:14.046 --> 01:08:17.484
Oh. shoot. I think they messed
up my drink order again.

1167
01:08:17.528 --> 01:08:21.444
You did order me
a skinny soy ginger latte
with organic whip. right?

1168
01:08:21.487 --> 01:08:23.228
-Of course.
-Mm.

1169
01:08:23.273 --> 01:08:26.841
It tastes funny for some reason.
Oh. my gosh.

1170
01:08:26.885 --> 01:08:29.496
I just remembered. I had
the best idea for our wedding.

1171
01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:32.237
-Okay...
-Let's decorate your go-kart

1172
01:08:32.282 --> 01:08:34.762
to be the escape vehicle
for our reception!

1173
01:08:36.242 --> 01:08:38.288
Sorry. hun. I got rid of it.

1174
01:08:38.331 --> 01:08:41.769
-What? Why? We had
so much fun on that car.
-I'm sorry. babe.

1175
01:08:41.813 --> 01:08:43.206
I had to sell it.

1176
01:08:43.249 --> 01:08:44.816
[Jill]
I don't understand. why?

1177
01:08:44.859 --> 01:08:47.166
Just trust me. Jill.
I had to get rid of it.

1178
01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:51.344
Okay. Jeez. it's like one of
those little trust exercises.

1179
01:08:51.388 --> 01:08:55.086
But after our marriage.
no more secrets. okay. babe?

1180
01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:58.656
-Just kiss me. beautiful.
-Ah. Sorry. babe. can't yet.

1181
01:08:58.699 --> 01:09:02.442
-I'm serious about us taking
a break until after our big day.
-[groans]

1182
01:09:02.486 --> 01:09:05.184
Jill. we lived together
for two years now. Come on.

1183
01:09:05.228 --> 01:09:08.969
I know. but if we take
a little break it will be
just that much more special.

1184
01:09:09.014 --> 01:09:11.886
-You know. our first time
as husband and wife.
-[grunting]

1185
01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:14.280
Come on now. babe. No pouting.

1186
01:09:15.237 --> 01:09:17.718
Hey. Good news.

1187
01:09:17.762 --> 01:09:21.200
I've got enough money to pay for
both trips to Paris and Venice.

1188
01:09:21.244 --> 01:09:25.422
-Mm. [chuckles]
-And in every country we'll be
doing it along the way.

1189
01:09:25.465 --> 01:09:27.859
Please. Larson.
Okay. your cart was awesome.

1190
01:09:27.902 --> 01:09:31.122
-but it's not enough
to fund our honeymoon. babe.
-No. of course not.

1191
01:09:32.733 --> 01:09:34.692
Don't worry.
I've taken care of it.

1192
01:09:34.735 --> 01:09:36.433
We're gonna have
plenty of money soon.

1193
01:09:37.956 --> 01:09:42.916
I have-- It's another
trust exercise. Okay?

1194
01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:43.917
Okay.

1195
01:09:45.268 --> 01:09:47.747
-Happy?
-[chuckles] Super!

1196
01:09:47.791 --> 01:09:49.663
Let's take a walk down
to the bridal shop.

1197
01:09:49.707 --> 01:09:52.578
and you show me what outrageous
dresses you picked out

1198
01:09:52.622 --> 01:09:54.712
-to torture
those bridesmaids with.
-Yes! [chuckles]

1199
01:09:54.755 --> 01:09:56.844
Oh. now.
What are we going to wear

1200
01:09:56.888 --> 01:09:59.325
to the club's
cocktail party tomorrow night?

1201
01:09:59.369 --> 01:10:02.154
Oh. wait. I know. I'll wear
floral. you wear gingham.

1202
01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:04.809
-We'll look as fresh
as a summer picnic!
-Come on. Jill!

1203
01:10:24.655 --> 01:10:25.786
[gasps]

1204
01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:27.309
Bill!

1205
01:10:27.353 --> 01:10:29.746
This looks ridiculous!

1206
01:10:30.748 --> 01:10:35.448
Now you know you can afford
to have the name properly
painted on there.

1207
01:10:35.492 --> 01:10:38.016
I will. I will.

1208
01:10:40.844 --> 01:10:42.585
Your knee still aching?

1209
01:10:43.848 --> 01:10:48.068
Bill. I have told you a hundred
times ago. get that looked at.

1210
01:10:48.112 --> 01:10:50.071
Now. why haven't you gone yet?

1211
01:10:50.115 --> 01:10:53.249
Marilyn. I've been busy.

1212
01:10:53.291 --> 01:10:57.688
I forget it hurts
until it hurts. You know me.

1213
01:10:57.731 --> 01:11:00.255
Yes. I do know you.

1214
01:11:00.299 --> 01:11:02.648
So if you need me to call
and make an appointment for you.

1215
01:11:02.693 --> 01:11:05.391
I will.
You just got to tell me when.

1216
01:11:05.434 --> 01:11:10.178
Marilyn. thanks.
but I don't need you
to make no appointment for me.

1217
01:11:10.222 --> 01:11:12.702
I do it when I do it.

1218
01:11:12.746 --> 01:11:15.793
You just fussing
because you want me
to finish your to-do list.

1219
01:11:15.835 --> 01:11:18.404
-My to-do list?
-Yes.

1220
01:11:18.448 --> 01:11:20.058
Our to-do list.

1221
01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:23.931
Now. we may be divorced. Bill.
but you promised me

1222
01:11:23.975 --> 01:11:26.064
you'd help me take care
of our family home.

1223
01:11:26.107 --> 01:11:28.066
So I'm gonna hold you to that.

1224
01:11:28.109 --> 01:11:31.243
And besides. Jill's wedding
will be here before you know it.

1225
01:11:31.287 --> 01:11:35.334
And I know you don't want
to let your baby girl down.
I know that.

1226
01:11:35.378 --> 01:11:37.205
So. get that knee looked at.

1227
01:11:37.249 --> 01:11:39.338
because you don't do
anybody any good

1228
01:11:39.382 --> 01:11:41.427
sitting around
on your bum all day.

1229
01:11:41.471 --> 01:11:42.559
Yes. ma'am.

1230
01:11:45.388 --> 01:11:47.955
-Hi. Ms. Connor.
-Hi. Scarlet.

1231
01:11:47.999 --> 01:11:49.261
Have a good day.

1232
01:11:50.130 --> 01:11:51.263
Hello. Colonel.

1233
01:11:51.307 --> 01:11:53.874
Hey. Miss Lady. what you up to?

1234
01:11:53.918 --> 01:11:56.398
Looking for someone to share
my coconut cupcakes with.

1235
01:11:56.442 --> 01:11:58.966
I made them for Daddy. but
he had to fly off to New York.

1236
01:11:59.010 --> 01:12:01.404
If that's an offer.
I'd love one.

1237
01:12:01.447 --> 01:12:03.231
Think your mom would want one?

1238
01:12:03.275 --> 01:12:05.146
Oh. you know her.
she's on a diet.

1239
01:12:06.147 --> 01:12:08.280
I should be on
one myself. but...

1240
01:12:09.412 --> 01:12:12.371
...you only live once and I
don't want to have any regrets.

1241
01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:16.288
Mm.

1242
01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:19.422
-Miss. you are
one of the best bakers I know.
-Thank you.

1243
01:12:19.465 --> 01:12:21.206
It's like it's your super power.

1244
01:12:23.164 --> 01:12:26.603
So. Colonel. I noticed
your golf cart isn't
in its usual parking space.

1245
01:12:27.517 --> 01:12:31.259
Well. uh. I had--
I had an incident and. uh...

1246
01:12:31.303 --> 01:12:33.349
-...sent her off for repairs.
-Oh. my!

1247
01:12:33.392 --> 01:12:35.655
Um. what happened?

1248
01:12:35.699 --> 01:12:38.309
Uh. well. it was late

1249
01:12:38.353 --> 01:12:41.094
and dark and I was coming
back from the club.

1250
01:12:41.139 --> 01:12:43.663
and. you know. I--
I hit something.

1251
01:12:43.707 --> 01:12:46.449
Oh. my. I sure hope
it wasn't a person.

1252
01:12:46.492 --> 01:12:49.407
Oh. God. No. it was.
gracious. no. it was--

1253
01:12:49.452 --> 01:12:51.671
It was like. uh. it was like a.

1254
01:12:51.715 --> 01:12:54.370
you know. it was like a post.
you know. in the parking lot.

1255
01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:57.111
-You know?
-Oh.

1256
01:12:57.155 --> 01:13:00.724
Oh. oh. yeah. yeah. And anyhow.
take this out. I got to--

1257
01:13:00.767 --> 01:13:03.422
I gotta go get dressed
for dinner and. uh...

1258
01:13:03.466 --> 01:13:05.903
-[unintelligible]
-No. no. no.
I understand that. but hey.

1259
01:13:05.946 --> 01:13:08.166
Yeah. it's time for you to go.
young lady. and. uh...

1260
01:13:08.209 --> 01:13:11.343
Yeah. Yeah. And I-- I'll be
seeing you and your parents

1261
01:13:11.387 --> 01:13:14.520
tomorrow night at the club.
Hey. you have-- Yeah.

1262
01:13:14.564 --> 01:13:16.522
-Yeah. You have a good night.
-Okay. Bye. Thank you.

1263
01:13:16.566 --> 01:13:19.786
Oh. yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Bye.

1264
01:13:24.922 --> 01:13:27.577
[calm music]

1265
01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:28.621
[Vonne]
Okay.

1266
01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:33.887
Oh. hey. Char. You've finally
come to learn from the master.

1267
01:13:33.931 --> 01:13:36.499
Uh. you're
my sailing instructor?

1268
01:13:36.541 --> 01:13:38.239
I know. right? Lucky.

1269
01:13:38.282 --> 01:13:41.373
Um. alright. So I am
going to take us for a sail.

1270
01:13:41.416 --> 01:13:43.593
Uh. I'll just teach you parts
of the boat. sailing terms

1271
01:13:43.636 --> 01:13:45.638
while we're out on the water.
Is that cool?

1272
01:13:45.682 --> 01:13:47.814
-Okay.
-Alright.

1273
01:13:47.858 --> 01:13:49.425
First things first.
Life jacket on.

1274
01:13:49.468 --> 01:13:52.297
Safety rule numero uno.Got it?

1275
01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:54.212
[chuckles]

1276
01:13:54.255 --> 01:13:55.822
Alright.

1277
01:13:55.866 --> 01:13:58.608
There is not much wind
in here right now.

1278
01:13:58.651 --> 01:14:01.219
So. I hope you like the paddle.

1279
01:14:01.262 --> 01:14:02.481
You need-- you need help?

1280
01:14:03.743 --> 01:14:05.832
-You got it?
-Yeah. I got it.

1281
01:14:05.876 --> 01:14:07.225
They just crossed--

1282
01:14:08.618 --> 01:14:10.532
No. like this one--
This one goes here.

1283
01:14:11.925 --> 01:14:14.580
One there. Two...

1284
01:14:14.624 --> 01:14:17.452
Sweet. Alright. How much
strength you got in these arms?

1285
01:14:17.496 --> 01:14:20.673
-Uh...
-It'll do. Alright.
You want to help me pushing it?

1286
01:14:20.717 --> 01:14:22.370
Alright. let's go.

1287
01:14:22.414 --> 01:14:23.937
[grunts] Okay then.
we're straight.

1288
01:14:25.809 --> 01:14:27.853
Alright. So. the front
is called the bow.
back is called the stern.

1289
01:14:27.898 --> 01:14:30.943
Left side is port.
right side is starboard. Got it?

1290
01:14:30.987 --> 01:14:32.642
-I guess.
-Don't worry.

1291
01:14:32.684 --> 01:14:34.469
The more you sail.
easier it's going to get.

1292
01:14:34.513 --> 01:14:37.559
-Hey. you know why
this is called the boom?
-No.

1293
01:14:37.603 --> 01:14:40.998
-Why?
-So. when we cross wind.
if you don't duck.

1294
01:14:41.041 --> 01:14:43.566
that's the sound is gonna make
when it hits you in the face.

1295
01:14:47.526 --> 01:14:48.701
[boom]

1296
01:14:54.141 --> 01:14:57.754
[romantic music]

1297
01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:41.798
[Aubrey]
Hey. Scarlet. I want you
to invite another person

1298
01:15:41.841 --> 01:15:43.234
to Charlotte's dinner party
tomorrow night.

1299
01:15:43.277 --> 01:15:45.584
-Okay. Who?
-Grant.

1300
01:15:45.628 --> 01:15:47.891
-Why?
-Well...

1301
01:15:47.934 --> 01:15:49.501
I think it'd be
really nice if she sees him.

1302
01:15:49.545 --> 01:15:51.547
[phone ringing]

1303
01:15:52.678 --> 01:15:54.245
Hey. Dalton. where are you?

1304
01:15:55.289 --> 01:15:58.858
[Dalton]
Um. I'm helping my dad
rebuild the deck.

1305
01:15:58.902 --> 01:16:01.034
He's probably not
going to let me go right now.

1306
01:16:01.077 --> 01:16:02.645
Oh. that sucks.

1307
01:16:03.559 --> 01:16:06.083
[Dalton]
And I've just been
working a lot.

1308
01:16:06.126 --> 01:16:07.911
-We've got to get this done.
-Oh. yeah.

1309
01:16:07.954 --> 01:16:10.566
Okay. I understand.

1310
01:16:10.609 --> 01:16:13.612
Scarlet and I were just
talking about Char's
dinner party tomorrow night.

1311
01:16:13.656 --> 01:16:15.222
You are coming. right?

1312
01:16:15.266 --> 01:16:17.398
[Dalton]
I'll be there. I promise.

1313
01:16:17.442 --> 01:16:18.748
Okay. Bye.

1314
01:16:20.793 --> 01:16:23.535
Okay. So. Roxi
can't come tonight.

1315
01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:25.624
But we have Finn here with us.

1316
01:16:25.668 --> 01:16:28.627
-New cut and all.
-Please. hold your applause.

1317
01:16:28.671 --> 01:16:30.020
Dalton can't make it tonight.

1318
01:16:30.063 --> 01:16:31.674
We already know
who killed Harley.

1319
01:16:31.717 --> 01:16:33.284
It was totally Carlos.

1320
01:16:33.327 --> 01:16:34.938
Char even said that the cart
was all banged up

1321
01:16:34.981 --> 01:16:36.504
and had blood all over it.

1322
01:16:36.548 --> 01:16:38.332
Case closed.

1323
01:16:38.376 --> 01:16:40.508
Maybe. But speaking of blood.

1324
01:16:40.552 --> 01:16:43.424
Roxi's cousin
was able to test
the blood from the sand trap.

1325
01:16:43.468 --> 01:16:45.383
Turns out it was
a match to Harley.

1326
01:16:45.425 --> 01:16:48.473
-So we do know where he died.
-Then we're done.

1327
01:16:48.516 --> 01:16:51.084
We know who and we know where.
We got to call Chief Bud.

1328
01:16:51.128 --> 01:16:54.522
I don't know just yet.
Carlos seems like
a pretty smart guy.

1329
01:16:54.566 --> 01:16:57.656
If he were to kill Harley.
he wouldn't leave the cart
next to his camper.

1330
01:16:57.700 --> 01:16:59.745
He would have dumped it.

1331
01:16:59.789 --> 01:17:03.401
Yeah. but you know who did
get rid of his cart really fast?

1332
01:17:03.443 --> 01:17:06.273
-Larsen.
-That's right. We overheard him
say that he sold it.

1333
01:17:06.317 --> 01:17:09.799
He told his fiancée.
Jill that he's going to have
some big money coming in.

1334
01:17:09.842 --> 01:17:13.411
I knew it.
Larson killed his father
so he could take his money.

1335
01:17:13.454 --> 01:17:17.241
That earring
could belong to Jill.
if they were working together.

1336
01:17:17.284 --> 01:17:20.070
I think we need
to do a little bit more
investigating on Larson

1337
01:17:20.112 --> 01:17:21.853
before we go call Chief Bud.

1338
01:17:21.898 --> 01:17:23.594
I don't think
Jill's involved though.

1339
01:17:23.639 --> 01:17:25.858
She plays a pretty
clueless bride-to-be.

1340
01:17:26.859 --> 01:17:29.209
Maybe the earring
isn't related at all.

1341
01:17:29.253 --> 01:17:32.952
The cart manager did tell Dalton
that one of the beer carts
was off for repairs.

1342
01:17:32.996 --> 01:17:35.346
He said it was weird because
they usually do it in-house.

1343
01:17:35.389 --> 01:17:37.565
What about Foster and Winona?

1344
01:17:37.609 --> 01:17:39.698
Are we sure
that they are both clear?

1345
01:17:39.742 --> 01:17:43.702
Based on what Tanner said.
Foster and Winona
sound pretty innocent.

1346
01:17:43.746 --> 01:17:45.922
You know. Roxi knows the
managers at the Chill Martini's.

1347
01:17:45.965 --> 01:17:47.924
Some of her art
is displayed there.

1348
01:17:47.967 --> 01:17:51.014
We can have her go and
find out what time they left.

1349
01:17:51.057 --> 01:17:54.887
What about the Colonel?
He sounded pretty guilty.

1350
01:17:54.931 --> 01:17:58.848
Aubrey. you should tell Dalton
to track down the Colonel's cart
at the local repair shops.

1351
01:17:58.891 --> 01:18:01.241
-See if he can find out
what happened to it.
-Okay.

1352
01:18:01.285 --> 01:18:02.982
And it has to be
done by tomorrow

1353
01:18:03.026 --> 01:18:06.029
because our three days
ends tomorrow night.

1354
01:18:06.072 --> 01:18:08.901
If any of you
find anything. text me.

1355
01:18:08.945 --> 01:18:11.034
Maybe we'll see some
of the suspects at the club.

1356
01:18:11.077 --> 01:18:14.472
Yeah. it's true.
We could probably spy on them
at Char's dinner.

1357
01:18:14.514 --> 01:18:16.255
[sighs] I don't know
why my mother insists

1358
01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:18.563
on giving me a birthday party
at the Country Club.

1359
01:18:18.606 --> 01:18:20.347
Not exactly my scene.

1360
01:18:20.391 --> 01:18:22.045
Because the food is awesome.

1361
01:18:22.088 --> 01:18:23.742
and you know she likes
a reason to get dressed up.

1362
01:18:23.786 --> 01:18:26.484
Alright.
I want to play some COD.

1363
01:18:26.527 --> 01:18:27.615
-[Finn] Yes.
-[Aubrey] Yes.

1364
01:18:27.659 --> 01:18:28.704
I'll go get snacks.

1365
01:18:32.969 --> 01:18:35.666
[Aubrey]
I'm so happy we finally
get to spend some time together.

1366
01:18:35.710 --> 01:18:36.755
Mm-hmm.

1367
01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:43.240
Dalton. Do you think this is
going to turn out okay?

1368
01:18:43.282 --> 01:18:46.373
I hope so. It's your little
joyride is gonna cost us all.

1369
01:18:46.416 --> 01:18:48.985
Hey! I wasn't out there alone.

1370
01:18:49.028 --> 01:18:50.769
-I thought we were
in this together.
-Yeah.

1371
01:18:50.813 --> 01:18:53.032
Rapping to the point
where we both go to prison.

1372
01:18:53.076 --> 01:18:55.731
-[Vonne] Hey. love birds.
-What are you doing here?

1373
01:18:55.773 --> 01:18:58.124
It's called chasing
you down for your half
of the Jet Ski money.

1374
01:18:58.168 --> 01:19:00.474
We've only got. like. two
hours till I lose my deposit.

1375
01:19:00.518 --> 01:19:02.346
Yeah. Um...

1376
01:19:02.389 --> 01:19:05.175
So. this is where you're
always running off to.

1377
01:19:05.218 --> 01:19:07.830
[chuckles softly]
Yeah. Come meet
my secret love. Chanel.

1378
01:19:11.224 --> 01:19:13.835
Be scared?
It's just a horse. man.

1379
01:19:13.879 --> 01:19:15.184
Just a horse?

1380
01:19:15.228 --> 01:19:17.361
She's my baby and we're a team.

1381
01:19:17.404 --> 01:19:20.843
I trust her that she will
take care of me over the jumps.

1382
01:19:20.886 --> 01:19:22.670
She's pretty cool.

1383
01:19:22.714 --> 01:19:25.456
But I admit. I've never. um...

1384
01:19:25.499 --> 01:19:28.154
I've never been
around a horse before.

1385
01:19:28.198 --> 01:19:30.809
Oh. So you do have
holes in your armor.

1386
01:19:30.853 --> 01:19:32.768
Don't be afraid.
She's the sweetest.

1387
01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:40.645
It's okay. Here.
Just right there. Yeah.

1388
01:19:40.688 --> 01:19:41.994
Oh. she's actually soft.

1389
01:19:42.038 --> 01:19:44.954
Yeah. Here.
You can give her a treat.

1390
01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:48.784
Here.

1391
01:19:48.827 --> 01:19:51.395
So. just right there.

1392
01:19:52.962 --> 01:19:54.920
-There you go.
-I just like that one.

1393
01:19:54.964 --> 01:19:57.096
Okay. I think that's
enough fun on the farm time.

1394
01:19:57.139 --> 01:19:59.882
-Let's go.
-That's right.
We got business to do.

1395
01:19:59.925 --> 01:20:02.188
You keep dodging me.
I'm gonna be out $1.000.

1396
01:20:02.232 --> 01:20:04.538
I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

1397
01:20:04.582 --> 01:20:07.150
-See you tonight. babe.
-Oh!

1398
01:20:07.193 --> 01:20:08.193
Okay.

1399
01:20:11.807 --> 01:20:14.722
-[Vonne] Almost forgot these.
-Oh. thank you.

1400
01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:17.856
Thanks for showing me
your secret love.

1401
01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:19.075
She's beautiful.

1402
01:20:25.951 --> 01:20:29.825
[calm music]

1403
01:20:36.962 --> 01:20:40.139
Well. Hello. Aubrey.
Can I help you?

1404
01:20:40.183 --> 01:20:41.619
Hello. Mrs. Graham.

1405
01:20:41.662 --> 01:20:43.055
I've got groceries
for the food pantry.

1406
01:20:43.099 --> 01:20:44.883
Oh. great!

1407
01:20:44.927 --> 01:20:47.668
We can set them on back there
by the other boxes.

1408
01:20:52.369 --> 01:20:55.067
I'll make sure it gets
with the rest of the donations.

1409
01:21:00.550 --> 01:21:03.815
We were going to bring
them on Sunday. but then...

1410
01:21:03.859 --> 01:21:05.948
Well. that's okay.

1411
01:21:05.991 --> 01:21:07.862
It's not too late.

1412
01:21:07.906 --> 01:21:10.387
The food bank
hasn't even picked up yet.

1413
01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:12.389
I've got more
in the front of my truck.

1414
01:21:12.432 --> 01:21:14.130
Great. I'll help you.

1415
01:21:16.262 --> 01:21:18.656
So. how are you. dear?

1416
01:21:18.699 --> 01:21:21.005
I hear you had some trouble
with your golf cart.

1417
01:21:21.050 --> 01:21:22.660
Oh. Yeah.

1418
01:21:28.273 --> 01:21:30.102
You know...

1419
01:21:30.146 --> 01:21:33.932
...when I have things
on my heart weighing me down.

1420
01:21:33.976 --> 01:21:36.239
I bring my words to God.

1421
01:21:36.282 --> 01:21:39.503
There's nothing your
Heavenly Father can't handle.

1422
01:21:39.546 --> 01:21:40.896
Just talk to Him.

1423
01:21:42.985 --> 01:21:48.338
How about if you take
a quiet moment and go inside

1424
01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:50.121
and sit down in the sanctuary?

1425
01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:53.255
If you can't find the words...

1426
01:21:53.299 --> 01:21:55.344
Well. that's okay.

1427
01:21:55.388 --> 01:21:57.564
You don't need to speak.

1428
01:21:57.608 --> 01:21:59.044
He hears your heart.

1429
01:22:02.004 --> 01:22:03.135
Okay.

1430
01:22:04.267 --> 01:22:05.137
Thank you.

1431
01:22:13.145 --> 01:22:14.364
[phone beeping]

1432
01:22:35.994 --> 01:22:37.300
Hey. did you see the text?

1433
01:22:39.128 --> 01:22:40.999
We're close now. Yay!

1434
01:22:41.043 --> 01:22:43.784
Hey. are Dalton and you okay?

1435
01:22:43.827 --> 01:22:46.222
Actually. I'm not sure.

1436
01:22:46.264 --> 01:22:49.268
Sometimes he's great and
the next thing I know he's gone.

1437
01:22:49.312 --> 01:22:51.575
Yeah. I can see
why you feel that way.

1438
01:22:51.618 --> 01:22:54.230
I tried to be patient
and he's always focused
on trying to pay

1439
01:22:54.273 --> 01:22:56.580
for half of his college tuition
like his dad wants.

1440
01:22:56.623 --> 01:23:00.148
But honestly. I think he's
over me and hasn't told me yet.

1441
01:23:00.192 --> 01:23:02.151
But are you
really that into him?

1442
01:23:02.193 --> 01:23:03.848
I'm starting to wonder.

1443
01:23:03.891 --> 01:23:06.023
But I am looking forward
to seeing him tonight.

1444
01:23:06.068 --> 01:23:08.157
Are you looking forward
to see anyone tonight?

1445
01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:10.986
-No.
-Maybe you should
open your eyes more.

1446
01:23:11.029 --> 01:23:13.989
You got some sweet friends
that would make some
good boyfriend material.

1447
01:23:14.032 --> 01:23:18.036
-No. Aubrey.
-Okay. if you say so.

1448
01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:19.777
Hey. will help me with my hair?

1449
01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:20.778
Sure.

1450
01:23:23.346 --> 01:23:26.958
[calm music]

1451
01:23:27.002 --> 01:23:29.874
Ah. Mom texted.
She's running a bit late.

1452
01:23:29.916 --> 01:23:31.267
Dad's flight
was diverted to Raleigh.

1453
01:23:31.309 --> 01:23:32.964
She's going there
to pick him up.

1454
01:23:33.008 --> 01:23:36.054
Okay. Uh.
shouldn't Dalton be here by now?

1455
01:23:36.098 --> 01:23:38.143
Yeah. he's coming. he promised.

1456
01:23:40.232 --> 01:23:43.627
[indistinct chatter]

1457
01:23:43.670 --> 01:23:46.891
Oh. I guess
he's not coming after all.

1458
01:23:46.934 --> 01:23:47.892
Excuse me.

1459
01:23:48.849 --> 01:23:50.112
Aubrey. it will be okay.

1460
01:23:51.764 --> 01:23:55.204
-Hey. Brynn. I like your onesie.
-[Betsy] Brynn. don't run off.

1461
01:23:55.246 --> 01:23:56.814
Oh. excuse me!

1462
01:23:56.857 --> 01:23:59.034
-Hey. Betsy.
-Hey. sweetie.

1463
01:23:59.077 --> 01:24:02.514
I could not get her
to put on her dress.
so I just finally gave up.

1464
01:24:02.559 --> 01:24:06.519
You know. with autism. you have
to pick your battles carefully.
because there's so many.

1465
01:24:06.563 --> 01:24:09.434
Right. Well. I like it.
She looks party ready.

1466
01:24:09.478 --> 01:24:12.090
I know I am. I need a drink.

1467
01:24:12.134 --> 01:24:14.484
I'll be right back.
I need to find Brynn.

1468
01:24:14.527 --> 01:24:17.835
[indistinct chatter]

1469
01:24:17.878 --> 01:24:19.489
[whispering] Why is Grant here?

1470
01:24:19.532 --> 01:24:20.968
Oh. Scarlet invited him.

1471
01:24:22.187 --> 01:24:24.189
Roxi! I love your dress.

1472
01:24:24.233 --> 01:24:27.279
Thanks. Hey. Finn.
Charlotte pulled you out again.

1473
01:24:27.323 --> 01:24:30.108
Well. I've been
in high demand lately.

1474
01:24:30.152 --> 01:24:32.371
Lucky Finn.
isn't he the popular one?

1475
01:24:32.415 --> 01:24:34.895
Grant. You clean up nicely.

1476
01:24:34.939 --> 01:24:37.811
Thanks. I'm. uh. trying to get
noticed by someone special.

1477
01:24:40.118 --> 01:24:42.728
Come on. Grant.
let's go grab drinks
for everyone while we wait.

1478
01:24:42.773 --> 01:24:44.383
Sure.

1479
01:24:44.427 --> 01:24:46.646
[Charlotte chuckles]
Is. uh. is this a thing?

1480
01:24:46.690 --> 01:24:49.300
No. this is not a thing.

1481
01:24:49.344 --> 01:24:50.563
Are you jealous?

1482
01:24:51.521 --> 01:24:53.653
Are you flirting with me?

1483
01:24:54.959 --> 01:24:57.179
That's what it takes
to get your attention?

1484
01:24:57.222 --> 01:24:58.397
Then yeah.

1485
01:25:02.445 --> 01:25:05.012
Oh. This is interesting.

1486
01:25:06.188 --> 01:25:09.147
Uh. come on. Roxi. let's--
let's go get those sodas.

1487
01:25:09.191 --> 01:25:12.107
Oh. right. Yeah. I love
a good root beer.

1488
01:25:14.761 --> 01:25:16.894
Actually. I can't stay.

1489
01:25:16.937 --> 01:25:19.592
My uncle's visiting. so I have
to have dinner with my family.

1490

Did Scarlet put you up to this?

-and root beer. right?
-Yeah.

1512
01:26:20.392 --> 01:26:21.871
I really do like root beer.

1513
01:26:21.915 --> 01:26:22.960
Alright. You got it.

-Hey. What are you doing here?

[chuckles] Of course.

01:26:39.455 --> 01:26:41.630
That's my favorite type.
Why are you here?

1521
01:26:41.674 --> 01:26:43.981
Uh. we're celebrating
Char's birthday.

1522
01:26:44.023 --> 01:26:46.201
Uh. where's Dalton?
Is he not your date?

1523
01:26:46.244 --> 01:26:50.727
Um. he bailed on me again.

1524
01:26:50.770 --> 01:26:52.684
I'm pretty sure we're over.

1525
01:26:52.728 --> 01:26:54.905
You know. if that's true.
he should man up and tell you.

1526
01:26:56.254 --> 01:26:57.995
Look. you're not
the only one getting dumped.

1527
01:26:58.038 --> 01:27:00.215
He completely left me hanging
on the Jet Ski deal.

1528
01:27:00.258 --> 01:27:02.652
Oh. I'm sorry.
You lost your deposit?

1529
01:27:02.695 --> 01:27:04.044
Yeah. Well...

1530
01:27:06.046 --> 01:27:09.441

really pretty tonight.

Oh. Thanks.

1532
01:27:12.314 --> 01:27:14.359
I'm sorry.
he made you come alone.

1533
01:27:15.447 --> 01:27:16.840
Whatever his reasons.

1534
01:27:16.883 --> 01:27:18.710
I hope it was
pretty damn important.

1535
01:27:18.755 --> 01:27:20.931

Mom. I did what you asked.

1544
01:27:54.704 --> 01:27:58.273
Really? You wouldn't
lie to me now. would you?

1545
01:27:58.316 --> 01:28:00.100
Your daddy used
to lie to me and I--

1546
01:28:00.144 --> 01:28:02.668
-I know you wouldn't lie to me.
-I'm not!

You paid off
all your gambling debts.

all of it. like we agreed?

1549
01:28:06.933 --> 01:28:11.198
Yes. I sold my boat. Jet Skis
and the golf cart to do it.

That's my good boy.

Of course. baby.

What can I do for you?

I think you know.

Alright. Winona. simmer down.

1563

I'm gonna go home
and pack an overnight bag.

and then I'm gonna
head on over to your house.

isn't the killer. Gina is.

Yes. And I have proof.
Gina killed Harley.

I'm in the bathroom now. hurry.

[suspenseful music]

1585
01:30:35.299 --> 01:30:37.693
Gina is the killer. Her and
Harley were having an affair.

-What? Are you sure?
-Yes. I'm sure.

1587
01:30:39.869 --> 01:30:41.610
And I think
Brynn witnessed the murder.

1588
01:30:41.653 --> 01:30:44.047
She was on the golf course
the night Harley died.

1589
01:30:44.090 --> 01:30:45.962
Gina's after her.
and we have to find her.

Take her in.

back from the airport.

Did you send your friends home?

1603
01:31:46.065 --> 01:31:48.198
Yeah. Their parents
are picking them up now.

1605
01:31:58.034 --> 01:32:00.384
Brynn. Oh. I was so worried.

1606
01:32:02.081 --> 01:32:03.300
Alright. Charlotte.

1607
01:32:04.954 --> 01:32:09.393
We did find Miss Young pursuing
your cousin rather aggressively.

1608
01:32:09.436 --> 01:32:11.874
I had Sergeant Hart
take her back to the station.

1609
01:32:12.831 --> 01:32:17.749
Now. How about you telling me
what's got you so worried?

1610
01:32:17.793 --> 01:32:20.360
I know that Gina
killed Harley Trudeau.

1611
01:32:20.404 --> 01:32:21.623
And you know this how?

1612
01:32:23.014 --> 01:32:25.017
I've got pics of Harley
and her together.

1613
01:32:25.061 --> 01:32:26.584
I got them off of her phone.

1614
01:32:26.628 --> 01:32:28.281
I'm pretty sure
they were having an affair.

1615
01:32:29.718 --> 01:32:32.329
Okay. Anything else?

1616
01:32:32.371 --> 01:32:34.112
See those expensive earrings?

1617
01:32:34.157 --> 01:32:36.376
Pretty sure
Harley gave them to her.

1618
01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:39.728
-Go on.
-She had them on
at the club cocktail party

1619
01:32:39.771 --> 01:32:41.599
the night that he was killed.

1620
01:32:41.643 --> 01:32:43.383
Brynn was outside
playing around the golf course.

1621
01:32:43.427 --> 01:32:44.559
and she found the earring

1622
01:32:44.602 --> 01:32:45.907
in a sand trap
near the crime scene.

1623
01:32:51.522 --> 01:32:53.611
And that's where I also found...

1624
01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:55.960
...its match.

1625
01:32:59.878 --> 01:33:01.401
You're gonna want
this sandbag too.

1626
01:33:03.228 --> 01:33:05.536
Harley's body
was hit by a small car.

1627
01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:07.973
a cart in this case.
Look at this.

1628
01:33:08.017 --> 01:33:11.237
I took pics of the tracks
around the sand trap.
just after the murder.

1629
01:33:11.281 --> 01:33:14.632
Two cart tracks lead into
the trap. three tracks lead out.

1630
01:33:14.675 --> 01:33:17.287
And you'll find
Harley's blood soaked
into the sand. if you dig.

1631
01:33:20.638 --> 01:33:23.335
See the tracks here? And here?

1632
01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:26.469
In this pic. Gina and Harley.
look at his tie.

1633
01:33:30.039 --> 01:33:32.650
This is the tie Harley
was wearing the night he died.

1634
01:33:32.693 --> 01:33:34.696
You can see it
in the party pics.

1635
01:33:34.739 --> 01:33:38.351
I'm sure that Brynn saw Gina
run over Harley with the cart.

1636
01:33:38.395 --> 01:33:40.005
That's why Brynn's been
running away from her.

1637
01:33:40.049 --> 01:33:42.617
And that's why
Gina chased after her.

1638
01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:44.923
Harley's body
was found in the cove.

1639
01:33:44.967 --> 01:33:47.621
That's why there are three track
marks leading out of the trap.

1640
01:33:47.665 --> 01:33:50.059
and why he had
strangle marks on his neck.

1641
01:33:50.102 --> 01:33:52.670
Gina tied his necktie
to the cart hitch.

1642
01:33:52.714 --> 01:33:55.499
-and dragged him to the pond.
-[gasps]

1643
01:33:55.541 --> 01:33:59.590
Oh. good Lord!
It's no wonder his head
didn't pop off like a grape.

1644
01:33:59.634 --> 01:34:03.159
We've heard enough. Brynn and I
are gonna wait for you outside.

1645
01:34:03.202 --> 01:34:04.726
Come on. Brynn.
let's go outside.

1646
01:34:08.730 --> 01:34:10.557
Charlotte. you were saying?

1647
01:34:10.601 --> 01:34:14.648
So. after Gina
put his body into the lake.

1648
01:34:14.692 --> 01:34:16.781
she lost the tie
and lost the earrings.

1649
01:34:16.825 --> 01:34:19.001
And that's when
Brynn came and found them.

1650
01:34:19.044 --> 01:34:23.701
Your evidence does
suggest that she's guilty.
But what's her motive?

1651
01:34:23.745 --> 01:34:27.923
Easy. Everyone at the club
has seen how Gina chases
after the wealthy man.

1652
01:34:27.966 --> 01:34:30.925
She finally caught one.
or so she thought.

1653
01:34:30.969 --> 01:34:35.103
Harley must have betrayed her.
and she turned to a jilted
lover. green with envy.

1654
01:34:35.147 --> 01:34:37.584
She wanted to be
the new Mrs. Trudeau.

1655
01:34:37.628 --> 01:34:40.500
You form a convincing theory.
Charlotte.

1656
01:34:40.544 --> 01:34:44.374
So good in fact.
I'd say it matches nicely
with our own findings.

1657
01:34:44.416 --> 01:34:47.464
Well. what about Carlos Harris?
Did he help Gina? I mean.

1658
01:34:47.507 --> 01:34:50.335
Charlotte saw his cart all
beat-up with blood all over it.

1659
01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:54.166
Carlos reported that he hit
a deer with his cart a week ago.

1660
01:34:55.210 --> 01:34:56.473
His story checks out.

1661
01:34:57.909 --> 01:35:01.521
So. I sent Sergeant Hart
to take a visit to the dump.

1662
01:35:03.175 --> 01:35:06.657
Beer cart number two was found
behind the trash heap.

1663
01:35:06.701 --> 01:35:10.487
And it had the damage you would
expect from hitting Harley.

1664
01:35:10.530 --> 01:35:13.359
-Well. what now?
-First off.

1665
01:35:13.403 --> 01:35:17.059
while I appreciate your sharp
and inquisitive minds.

1666
01:35:17.102 --> 01:35:20.540
and your courage and trying
to keep Aubrey from getting
in trouble...

1667
01:35:21.803 --> 01:35:23.805
...you need
to let me handle this.

1668
01:35:25.327 --> 01:35:28.374
Second off. you and your friends

1669
01:35:28.418 --> 01:35:30.898
need to come down
to the station tomorrow

1670
01:35:30.942 --> 01:35:33.335
and give me a full statement.

1671
01:35:33.379 --> 01:35:34.859
[Dixie on radio]
Chief Bud. you there?

1672
01:35:37.906 --> 01:35:39.385
Yes. Dixie. I'm here.

1673
01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:43.563
[Dixie on radio]
Tanner says Miss Young
is singing like a bird.

1674
01:35:43.607 --> 01:35:44.913
You better get back here.

1675
01:35:45.914 --> 01:35:47.437
Alright. Dixie. I'm coming.

1676
01:35:49.091 --> 01:35:53.008
Alright. So you two.
get home safe and sound.

1677
01:35:53.050 --> 01:35:56.054
and please try
to stay out of trouble.

1678
01:35:57.752 --> 01:35:58.753
You have a good night.

1679
01:36:01.016 --> 01:36:03.975
[crickets chirping]

1680
01:36:21.862 --> 01:36:23.386

1681
01:36:32.525 --> 01:36:33.612
[sighs]

1682

[suspenseful music]

1683
01:36:40.882 --> 01:36:42.579
[Winona]
So now you know. my love...

1684
01:36:43.710 --> 01:36:45.582
...why I did what I had to do.

1685
01:36:47.062 --> 01:36:48.454
And why I couldn't tell you.

1686
01:36:53.633 --> 01:36:55.635
I will miss you terribly.

1687
01:36:56.898 --> 01:36:58.943
You made me feel alive again.

1688
01:36:59.987 --> 01:37:03.687
I've never felt
so beautiful and happy...

1689
01:37:04.906 --> 01:37:05.950
...and for that...

1690
01:37:07.038 --> 01:37:08.605
...I'll be forever grateful.

1691
01:37:09.562 --> 01:37:12.434
[suspenseful music continues]

1692
01:37:23.489 --> 01:37:25.273
I couldn't have
had a better alibi.

1693
01:37:26.492 --> 01:37:27.537
A lover.

1694
01:37:33.804 --> 01:37:34.761
Winona.

1695
01:37:35.632 --> 01:37:36.675
Winona!

1696
01:37:48.862 --> 01:37:49.994
[sighs]

1697
01:37:51.387 --> 01:37:52.736
[sighs deeply]

1698
01:38:06.445 --> 01:38:07.751
[phone beeping]

1699
01:38:11.581 --> 01:38:15.019
[loud upbeat music playing]

1700
01:38:49.793 --> 01:38:51.142
-Hey.
-Hey.

1701
01:39:04.851 --> 01:39:07.898
[loud upbeat music continues]

1702
01:39:31.878 --> 01:39:34.142
-Oh. guys!
-Going somewhere. Foster?

1703
01:39:34.184 --> 01:39:35.404
[Foster]
Hold on. Whoa.

1704
01:39:36.927 --> 01:39:39.321
-Stop.
-[Tanner] Why don't you
take a seat?

1705
01:39:42.063 --> 01:39:44.674
Looks like you've had
quite a night. Mr. Davis?

1706
01:39:46.241 --> 01:39:48.591
Where's Winona Trudeau?

1707
01:39:48.634 --> 01:39:49.940
I don't know!

1708
01:39:50.941 --> 01:39:52.898
Like. she left
about 20 minutes ago.

1709
01:39:52.943 --> 01:39:55.076
She's getting away.
She's the one you want.

1710
01:39:55.119 --> 01:39:57.034
Better put an APB out on her.

1711
01:39:59.123 --> 01:40:02.474
You know. we've been talking to
Gina Young down at the station.

1712
01:40:02.518 --> 01:40:05.260
I swear. I had nothing
to do with Harley's death.

1713
01:40:05.303 --> 01:40:06.782
Winona fooled me too.

1714
01:40:06.826 --> 01:40:08.741
Is that right?

1715
01:40:08.785 --> 01:40:10.960
It looks like she left you
a nice little parting gift.

1716
01:40:11.005 --> 01:40:12.353
all wrapped in ribbon.

1717
01:40:12.397 --> 01:40:14.878
Take it.
I want nothing to do with this.

1718
01:40:14.921 --> 01:40:16.227
[Bud]
Alright. Mr. Davis.

1719
01:40:18.099 --> 01:40:20.623
How about you give us
a short version of
what went on here tonight?

1720
01:40:20.666 --> 01:40:22.451
Winona tricked me.

1721
01:40:22.494 --> 01:40:24.322
I thought
we were playing a game.

1722
01:40:24.366 --> 01:40:26.237
Next thing I know.
I'm tied to a chair

1723
01:40:26.281 --> 01:40:28.065
and she's pointing a gun at me.

1724
01:40:28.109 --> 01:40:29.849
[chuckles]

1725
01:40:29.893 --> 01:40:32.068
What. you didn't see
that one coming?

1726
01:40:32.112 --> 01:40:33.114
Continue.

1727
01:40:34.289 --> 01:40:36.682
Winona has said that
about a month ago.

1728
01:40:36.726 --> 01:40:39.946
Harley told her
he was going divorce her
and marry his secretary.

1729
01:40:39.990 --> 01:40:41.687
Winona signed a prenup.

1730
01:40:41.731 --> 01:40:44.342
And over the years. Larson
lost favor with his daddy.

1731
01:40:44.386 --> 01:40:46.692
So she was determined
to do whatever it took

1732
01:40:46.736 --> 01:40:48.433
to maintain their lifestyle.

1733
01:40:48.477 --> 01:40:50.478
How'd Gina Young get involved?

1734
01:40:50.522 --> 01:40:52.959
Winona said that her revenge
will be even sweeter

1735
01:40:53.003 --> 01:40:55.309
if she had one of Harley's
flings do the dirty work.

1736
01:40:55.353 --> 01:40:57.964
She said. she was killing
two birds with one stone.

1737
01:40:58.008 --> 01:40:59.531
So. she approached Gina.

1738
01:40:59.575 --> 01:41:01.577
And you had no part in this?

1739
01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:03.231
No. I didn't!

1740
01:41:04.362 --> 01:41:07.757
Winona told Gina that Harley
has been cheating on her.

1741
01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:10.325
And how he's planning
to run off with his latest
flavor of the month.

1742
01:41:10.368 --> 01:41:12.240
That was enough
to fuel the fire.

1743
01:41:12.282 --> 01:41:14.329
I mean. Gina went nuts!

1744
01:41:14.371 --> 01:41:16.418
Then all Winona had to do

1745
01:41:16.460 --> 01:41:18.159
was offer to pay Gina
to kill him.

1746
01:41:18.202 --> 01:41:20.117
And that was enough
to seal his fate.

1747
01:41:20.161 --> 01:41:22.684
Did she tell you the plan?

1748
01:41:22.728 --> 01:41:26.384
Just said. Winona made sure
the drinks kept flowing
to Harley's direction

1749
01:41:26.428 --> 01:41:28.647
last Friday
at the club cocktail.

1750
01:41:28.691 --> 01:41:31.563
She knew he'd get drunk
and that they'd get fighting.

1751
01:41:31.607 --> 01:41:34.871
and then he'd go looking
for Gina after he dropped
her off at home.

1752
01:41:34.914 --> 01:41:37.568
And sure enough.
he found Gina leaving the club.

1753
01:41:38.788 --> 01:41:41.746
Then... Gina took him
for a ride on the beer cart.

1754
01:41:41.791 --> 01:41:44.663
She pushed him out of the cart.
and he's stumbling around.

1755
01:41:44.707 --> 01:41:48.189
so she chases him down into
the sand pit and runs him over.

1756
01:41:48.232 --> 01:41:51.931
According to Winona.
one groan and he's gone.

1757
01:41:51.975 --> 01:41:53.889
That sounds about right.

1758
01:41:53.933 --> 01:41:55.370
Don't you think so. Tanner?

1759
01:41:55.413 --> 01:41:57.763
I'd say so.

1760
01:41:57.807 --> 01:42:00.070
Same story Gina
told us at the station.

1761
01:42:01.157 --> 01:42:03.334
You're a lucky man. Foster.

1762
01:42:03.378 --> 01:42:08.644
You got an alibi.
Gina claims Winona didn't
want you mixed up in all this.

1763
01:42:08.687 --> 01:42:10.514
Thank God.

1764
01:42:11.777 --> 01:42:13.910
[Bud]
That's all for tonight.
Mr. Davis.

1765
01:42:14.954 --> 01:42:17.653
But I'm gonna need you
to come down to the station
in the morning

1766
01:42:17.696 --> 01:42:20.264
to give us your full statement.

1767
01:42:20.308 --> 01:42:21.960
Tanner.

1768
01:42:22.005 --> 01:42:23.659
Collect that for me. will you?

1769
01:42:23.702 --> 01:42:25.661
Yes. sir. Mm.

1770
01:42:37.368 --> 01:42:38.456
Toodles. Foster.

1771
01:42:45.376 --> 01:42:48.423
