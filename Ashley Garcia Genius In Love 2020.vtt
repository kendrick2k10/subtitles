[in Spanish] <i>¡Feliz Navidad!</i>

4
00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:16.141
Gingerbread. carols.

5
00:00:16.224 --> 00:00:17.142
lights?

6
00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:19.227
It's the most wonderful time of the year!

7
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.521
-[girls and Stick] Merry Christmas.
-[flatly] Ho ho ho.

8
00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:24.607
Okay. grinches.

9
00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:27.360
You didn't wanna decorate the tree.
you didn't wanna sing carols.

10
00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:29.529
and I had to make the tamales
all by myself.

11
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.240
Hey. we said we'd help you eat 'em.

12
00:00:32.907 --> 00:00:36.077
What could you possibly be doing
that's more important

13
00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:37.245
than Christmas?

14
00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:40.832
"Application
for the Astronaut Training Program."

15
00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:42.667
Well. la-di-da.

16
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.298
Look. I see your application is due
at the end of the year.

17
00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:50.050
but it's Christmas Eve.

18
00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:52.802
Ash. it's important to share in a moment

19
00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:54.929
with friends and family
when you have the time.

20
00:00:55.013 --> 00:00:56.431
We're sharing the Wi-Fi.

21
00:00:57.974 --> 00:00:59.309
Don't worry. Coach. I'll help you

22
00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:01.770
as soon as I finish editing
my latest short film.

23
00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:04.898
You know how some people put GoPros
on their dogs or cats?

24
00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:05.982
I put one on my mom.

25
00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:10.487
She goes down some weird roads.

26
00:01:12.197 --> 00:01:13.948
And I'm making my football highlight reel.

27
00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:16.493
Did you guys know
I'm really good at football?

28
00:01:17.535 --> 00:01:19.788
And I gotta finish
my Christmas Insta Story:

29
00:01:19.954 --> 00:01:22.791
"How to Apply a Foundation
That Will Resist Lipstick Transfer

30
00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:24.667
When Getting Kissed by Your Grandma."

31
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.086
Oh. come on. guys.

32
00:01:26.544 --> 00:01:28.296
None of that is more important...

33
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.631
than this!

34
00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:33.885
Christmas Togetherness Funtime
Gingerbread House!

35
00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:36.846
I'm... not intrigued.

36
00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:40.517
Oh. no! This application says

37
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.437
I need a reference from my supervisor.
and Dr. Ling is still annoyed at me

38
00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:48.399
for accidentally eating
her prescription yogurt out of the fridge.

39
00:01:49.025 --> 00:01:50.777
I better call her and apologize.

40
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.488
You call her on Christmas Eve.
you're gonna have to apologize.

41
00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:55.782
No. no. this is the best time to call her.

42
00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:56.908
She loves Christmas.

43
00:01:56.991 --> 00:01:57.867
It's her...

44
00:01:58.743 --> 00:02:02.205
well. Christmas.
She'll be in a very forgiving mood.

45
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.668
But...
we have to build this gingerbread house.

46
00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:09.963
We're not always gonna be
all together like this.

47
00:02:10.046 --> 00:02:11.756
<i>Tío. </i>it's fine. Nobody's going anywhere.

48
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.176
There's plenty of time.
This says it's good until... 2028.

49
00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:17.470
Ugh! What is in this?

50
00:02:19.514 --> 00:02:20.807
Happiness and memories...

51
00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:23.309
and a lot of preservatives.

52
00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:27.814
Dr. Ling. I needed to discuss a matter--

53
00:02:27.897 --> 00:02:28.898
No. too formal.

54
00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:32.694
Ling! Lingster! [chuckles]

55
00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:34.279
Yeah. that's it.

56
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.283
I needed to talk to you
about a possible recommendation letter.

57
00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:40.577
But first. about your yogurt.

58
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.705
Condensation can lead to names
on food being blurred.

59
00:02:43.788 --> 00:02:45.999
so I didn't technically see your name
on it.

60
00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:47.417
I made a mistake.

61
00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:49.085
or in modern parlance.

62
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.461
"I done goofed."

63
00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:54.465
Thank you so much for understanding.
Happy holidays.

64
00:02:55.383 --> 00:02:56.593
I'm so ready. [exhales]

65
00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:58.469
Let's do this for reals.

66
00:02:58.553 --> 00:02:59.679
-[sighs] Okay.
-[dialing]

67
00:02:59.762 --> 00:03:01.723
-[line ringing]
-[on voice mail] <i>It's Dr. Ling.</i>

68
00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:04.100
<i>I'm not here.</i>
<i>and if this is another robocall.</i>

69
00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:05.768
<i>just know that I'm developing</i>

70
00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:07.103
<i>a robot to destroy you.</i>

71
00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:08.646
-[bangs loudly]
-[voice mail beeps]

72
00:03:10.064 --> 00:03:12.066
[chimes play]

73
00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:14.444
[automated voice] <i>Welcome home. Victor.</i>

74
00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:18.239
<i>How was the 2027 solo concert tour?</i>

75
00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:19.324
Amazing. [sighs]

76
00:03:19.407 --> 00:03:20.575
Sellouts every night.

77
00:03:20.658 --> 00:03:22.869
They love me everywhere. [exhales]

78
00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:26.122
Except for that one guy in Boston
who threw a flashlight at me.

79
00:03:27.081 --> 00:03:28.541
Thanks for asking. Houseminder.

80
00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:31.836
[Houseminder] <i>Part of my programming.</i>
<i>I don't really care.</i>

81
00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:35.715
<i>Now that you're home.</i>
<i>here's your to-do list for today.</i>

82
00:03:35.798 --> 00:03:38.593
<i>December 23. 2027.</i>

83
00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:42.555
<i>Item number one of 18.612:</i>

84
00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.682
<i>Change smoke alarm battery.</i>

85
00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:47.477
[scoffs] Maybe you could've done that
the year I was gone.

86
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:49.896
I'm exhausted. [sighs]

87
00:03:50.104 --> 00:03:52.148
I'm looking forward to a quiet Christmas
at home.

88
00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:53.650
all by myself.

89
00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:55.902
[Houseminder]
<i>You could have just said. "Mute."</i>

90
00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:57.779
<i>I don't actually care.</i>

91
00:03:58.363 --> 00:04:01.115
-[door opens]
-[Ashley] <i>Tío </i>Victor! It's me! I'm home!

92
00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:02.700
-Ashley?
-[door closes]

93
00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:06.287
[Houseminder] <i>Your niece gets home today</i>
<i>from her six-year mission to Mars.</i>

94
00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:07.914
<i>-I would have told you--</i>
-Mute!

95
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:09.749
Ashley?

96
00:04:09.832 --> 00:04:11.417
<i>-Tío! </i>[giggling]
-[Victor] Aw!

97
00:04:11.793 --> 00:04:12.669
Oh!

98
00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:14.796
So. how was Mars?

99
00:04:15.338 --> 00:04:16.381
It was nice.

100
00:04:16.464 --> 00:04:19.884
Who knew the entire planet smelled
like hot dogs? [sighs]

101
00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:23.054
-But there's really no place like home.
-So. you're staying through Christmas?

102
00:04:23.137 --> 00:04:24.847
Absolutely. [chuckles]

103
00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:26.182
[sighs happily]

104
00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:29.519
I was hoping to have Stick.
Brooke. and Tad over to celebrate.

105
00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:31.354
[sighs] I miss my friends so much.

106
00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:34.482
I wasn't able to talk to anyone back home
while I was on the mission.

107
00:04:34.565 --> 00:04:38.361
Once you get past the Apollo asteroids.
the roaming charges are outrageous.

108
00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:40.363
How is everybody?

109
00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:42.407
Well. Tad's starting quarterback

110
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.285
for one of the newest NFL teams.
the Walmart Greeters.

111
00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:49.122
Stick won an Oscar
with his last documentary.

112
00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:52.375
And Brooke is now the leading style guru
on the planet.

113
00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:54.168
after Kylie Jenner became a nun.

114
00:04:55.503 --> 00:04:58.298
Oh. I knew my friends would go on
to do great things.

115
00:04:58.381 --> 00:04:59.674
Have you seen any of them?

116
00:04:59.757 --> 00:05:01.551
No. They don't come into Pat's anymore.

117
00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:03.720
Last time I saw Tad.
he said they'd all lost touch.

118
00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:05.972
Well. I'm gonna get everyone
back together.

119
00:05:06.055 --> 00:05:07.056
I don't know. Ash.

120
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.725
It may not be that easy.

121
00:05:09.058 --> 00:05:12.228
It'll be fine. We're all best friends.
and it's Christmas.

122
00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:15.106
[Houseminder]
<i>Victor. aren't you going to introduce me?</i>

123
00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:16.524
I said. "Mute." Houseminder.

124
00:05:16.607 --> 00:05:17.608
I'd get rid of her.

125
00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:20.028
but she's the only one that knows
how to work the AC.

126
00:05:20.903 --> 00:05:22.113
<i>Tío. </i>I can show you.

127
00:05:22.196 --> 00:05:24.991
[Houseminder]
<i>Humans--they're always taking our jobs.</i>

128
00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:29.203
[theme music playing]

129
00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:34.667
[exhales] I dug up
some more Christmas things

130
00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:36.127
I haven't taken out in years.

131
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.296
I forgot how much fun Christmas could be.

132
00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:41.466
-It's not the same when you're alone.
-It's not the same on Mars. either.

133
00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:42.425
Although. last year.

134
00:05:42.508 --> 00:05:44.886
we invited the Martians
into the station to celebrate.

135
00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:46.012
They're usually very quiet.

136
00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:48.389
but once those little guys got
into the eggnog... [chuckles]

137
00:05:48.473 --> 00:05:49.349
Whoa!

138
00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:52.810
Seriously. there's life on Mars?

139
00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:54.395
[chuckling] There sure was that night.

140
00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:55.396
Whoo!

141
00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.902
What would you say
to some Christmas tamales?

142
00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:03.696
I'd say. "Hello. tamales.
Get in my tum-tum."

143
00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:05.782
I'll get some started.

144
00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:06.699
I'll be right in.

145
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.701
[Brooke gasps] Ashley!

146
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.286
Brooke?

147
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.496
[Brooke] Oh. right.

148
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.041
[both scream. giggle]

149
00:06:15.124 --> 00:06:17.043
[Brooke] I can't believe
you're really here.

150
00:06:17.126 --> 00:06:18.419
I missed you so much.

151
00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:20.171
What is that visor thing?

152
00:06:20.254 --> 00:06:23.549
Oh! It's my newest product
to protect against the sun's rays.

153
00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:25.009
-That's amazing.
-[Brooke] Mm-hmm.

154
00:06:25.093 --> 00:06:26.302
What's the science behind it?

155
00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:29.597
The science is
I sold four million of those last year.

156
00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:32.975
How have you been?

157
00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:34.685
-So good. So busy.
-[giggles]

158
00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:36.229
I'm so glad you made time for me.

159
00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:37.522
Oh! You're my bestie.

160
00:06:37.605 --> 00:06:39.273
Of course I made time for you.

161
00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:42.110
But I do have to make
my Christmas Eve Insta Story

162
00:06:42.193 --> 00:06:43.444
while I'm here.

163
00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:45.905
-You're okay with that. right?
-Of course.

164
00:06:45.988 --> 00:06:48.074
If I don't post.
the president won't know what to do

165
00:06:48.157 --> 00:06:49.367
with her eye shadow.

166
00:06:50.034 --> 00:06:50.993
You're so famous!

167
00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:52.036
I know!

168
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.704
[both giggle]

169
00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:55.790
Those six years when I was up in space

170
00:06:55.873 --> 00:06:57.834
were the longest time we were ever apart.

171
00:06:57.917 --> 00:07:00.878
[sighs] Even longer
than when you went away to college.

172
00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:02.797
You know. I never told you this.

173
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.467
but when you left. I was kind of afraid
you would never come back.

174
00:07:07.176 --> 00:07:08.177
Oh. Brooke. don't cry.

175
00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:09.303
You'll ruin your makeup.

176
00:07:09.387 --> 00:07:10.263
Don't worry.

177
00:07:10.346 --> 00:07:13.141
I've trained myself to cry without tears.
[chuckles]

178
00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:15.810
[crying] Oh. no.

179
00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:18.020
I guess it doesn't work with happy tears.

180
00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:21.190
Oh!

181
00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:23.818
[sighs] I'm so happy to have you back.

182
00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:25.403
Now we can do this all the time.

183
00:07:25.486 --> 00:07:27.280
Tonight's just gonna be
like the old times:

184
00:07:27.363 --> 00:07:28.656
you. me. Stick. and Tad.

185
00:07:28.739 --> 00:07:31.993
Wait. Stick and Tad a-are coming here?

186
00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:33.786
At the same time?

187
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:34.787
[door opens]

188
00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.081
-Ashley!
-Stick!

189
00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:38.499
-Brooke!
-Stick!

190
00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:39.625
Ashley!

191
00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:41.127
-[Ashley] Tad!
-Brooke!

192
00:07:41.335 --> 00:07:43.087
-Tad.
-Stick!

193
00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:44.088
Tad!

194
00:07:46.507 --> 00:07:50.970
Is the person whose name is the same
as a piece of wood going to be staying?

195
00:07:51.387 --> 00:07:53.598
Because if so. I'm outta here.

196
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.892
Tell the person who just spoke

197
00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:58.853
that I cracked the code.
and I know he's talkin' about me.

198
00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:00.271
And I'm outta here first.

199
00:08:00.354 --> 00:08:03.274
Whoa. Tad. Stick.
you guys were inseparable.

200
00:08:03.357 --> 00:08:04.317
Why are you fighting?

201
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.819
-I'm not talkin' about it.
-I'm not talking about it more.

202
00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:10.698
Well. it is Christmas. and you're staying.
so that's that.

203
00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:12.492
Well. I really shouldn't.

204
00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:14.243
I'm editing my latest documentary.

205
00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.037
My art is calling me.

206
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.790
And I am negotiating
several big product-endorsement deals

207
00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:23.044
as I am a very famous football player
here in the future.

208
00:08:24.712 --> 00:08:26.422
My money is calling me.

209
00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:29.717
But it's Christmas.
and we're best friends. Right. Brooke?

210
00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:33.095
Oh. I'll be under here
until this blows over.

211
00:08:35.431 --> 00:08:37.308
We can have some Christmas fun.

212
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.602
How about we build this...

213
00:08:39.685 --> 00:08:41.812
[grunts] ...giant gingerbread house?

214
00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:43.272
Doesn't that sound great?

215
00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:45.816
We almost did this a long time ago.
remember?

216
00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:47.610
Christmas Togetherness Funtime?

217
00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:49.529
It says so right here. Right above...

218
00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:51.364
"May contain rat feces."

219
00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:56.494
Well. who am I to argue with the box?
I'll stay.

220
00:08:56.577 --> 00:08:57.912
You can go. Stick.

221
00:08:57.995 --> 00:08:59.830
Who says I'm going? Ashley invited me too.

222
00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:02.041
-I'm staying.
-Now. I think we should start

223
00:09:02.124 --> 00:09:02.959
with the walls.

224
00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:04.919
Tad. Stick. can you find
the pieces like this?

225
00:09:05.002 --> 00:09:06.671
Oh. no. I'm not working with him.

226
00:09:06.754 --> 00:09:08.881
-But you guys said you were staying.
-Well. not anymore.

227
00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:10.299
I'm afraid I'll have to leave.

228
00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:12.635
-I'm afraid I'll have to leave first.
-Whoa! Wait. wait!

229
00:09:12.718 --> 00:09:15.513
Tad. you can work on the roof
in the kitchen.

230
00:09:15.596 --> 00:09:17.723
and Stick.
you can build the walls in here.

231
00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:18.641
Fine.

232
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:19.976
Finer.

233
00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:22.853
[gasps] Ooh. nice save.

234
00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:24.397
No. this is awful.

235
00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:25.731
All I thought about in space

236
00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:28.651
was how badly I wanted to come back
and see all my friends.

237
00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:29.569
And nachos.

238
00:09:30.695 --> 00:09:32.905
And now I come back.
and none of you are friends.

239
00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:34.532
-We have to fix this.
-[sighs]

240
00:09:34.615 --> 00:09:37.243
Can you hang on just a second?
The pope just DM'd me.

241
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.036
She got some really bad bangs.

242
00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:42.582
[sighs] She needs me...
and probably a headband.

243
00:09:50.214 --> 00:09:52.508
You got the whole gang back together.
Ash. you're amazing.

244
00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:55.303
Only. they're not together.
Stick and Tad had some fight.

245
00:09:55.386 --> 00:09:57.680
and they won't tell me what happened
or be in the same room.

246
00:09:57.763 --> 00:09:59.974
I'll handle this. Guys!

247
00:10:01.183 --> 00:10:02.476
I'm gonna ask you one question.

248
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.313
and if you still feel like fighting
after you answer it.

249
00:10:05.688 --> 00:10:06.856
I won't bother you anymore.

250
00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:09.734
Blurt out the first thing
that comes to mind when I ask.

251
00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:11.652
What is the true meaning of Christmas?

252
00:10:11.736 --> 00:10:13.112
-Toys!
-I'm Jewish.

253
00:10:17.241 --> 00:10:20.202
Fine. I will tell you
what the true meaning of Christmas is.

254
00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:21.412
I said toys.

255
00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.666
Christmas is not about fighting.

256
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.501
Everything you need to know
about Christmas

257
00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:29.128
is in the movie <i>Home Alone.</i>

258
00:10:29.211 --> 00:10:30.046
<i>Home Alone?</i>

259
00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:32.173
That movie is just about fighting.

260
00:10:33.716 --> 00:10:34.675
That sick kid

261
00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:36.969
took a blowtorch
to that poor burglar's head.

262
00:10:37.553 --> 00:10:38.554
A blowtorch?

263
00:10:38.804 --> 00:10:40.431
For a property crime? Come on.

264
00:10:41.807 --> 00:10:43.976
I'm talking about the scary neighbor.

265
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.479
Kevin helps him reunite with his family

266
00:10:46.562 --> 00:10:47.480
because...

267
00:10:48.022 --> 00:10:52.151
he knows Christmas is about being
with the people you love.

268
00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:55.529
And nothing could keep me
from being here today.

269
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.949
-Aw. <i>tío. </i>that was so--
-[ringtone playing]

270
00:10:59.033 --> 00:11:00.618
Hold on. It's my manager.

271
00:11:00.826 --> 00:11:02.370
-[cell phone clicks]
-What's up. Showman?

272
00:11:02.453 --> 00:11:04.413
[Showman] <i>Yo. yo. yo. Garcia. baby.</i>

273
00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:07.124
<i>Pitbull just pulled out of</i>
<i>his Christmas show in Vegas.</i>

274
00:11:07.208 --> 00:11:09.502
<i>Last minute.</i>
<i>he decides he wants to be with his family.</i>

275
00:11:09.585 --> 00:11:11.504
<i>Can you fill in for him?</i>
<i>Playing a venue this size</i>

276
00:11:11.587 --> 00:11:13.506
<i>could take your career</i>
<i>to the next level. Vickie.</i>

277
00:11:13.589 --> 00:11:15.299
<i>You could be Mr. Worldwide.</i>

278
00:11:15.383 --> 00:11:18.094
You want me to fill in for Pitbull
on Christmas?

279
00:11:18.177 --> 00:11:20.805
-[scoffs]
-Uh. yeah. I'm not doing anything.

280
00:11:21.555 --> 00:11:24.350
<i>-Tío </i>Victor--
-Ash. I'm talking to my manager.

281
00:11:25.434 --> 00:11:28.479
This is the best Christmas ever.
I love you. Showman. Gotta pack.

282
00:11:28.562 --> 00:11:29.897
But what about tamales?

283
00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.732
Oh. right.
I left the stuff on the counter.

284
00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:34.318
Houseminder. Google a tamale recipe
for Ashley. [snaps]

285
00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:37.238
[Houseminder] <i>He never says please.</i>

286
00:11:37.655 --> 00:11:39.407
<i>I give. and I give...</i>

287
00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:40.324
[Victor] Mute!

288
00:11:42.493 --> 00:11:46.205
Listen. if Young Weasel made it
through 2024.

289
00:11:46.288 --> 00:11:47.498
you can make it through this.

290
00:11:48.916 --> 00:11:50.167
I love you too. Oprah.

291
00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.546
Aw... [laughs]

292
00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:55.840
...you're one of <i>my </i>favorite things.

293
00:11:56.757 --> 00:11:57.925
Okay. Ciao.

294
00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:01.345
-[cell phone clicks]
<i>-Tío </i>Victor's bailing.

295
00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:04.056
Stick and Tad can't even be
in the same room together.

296
00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.267
This is not the Christmas
I was hoping to have!

297
00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:09.228
I think I have a plan on how to get Stick
and Tad back together.

298
00:12:09.311 --> 00:12:10.688
but I'm gonna need your help.

299
00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:15.735
Well. I do have
200 million followers anxiously waiting

300
00:12:15.818 --> 00:12:16.902
for my post tonight.

301
00:12:17.486 --> 00:12:20.030
but... I only have one best friend.

302
00:12:20.614 --> 00:12:22.408
And don't tell Lizzo. but it's you.

303
00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:26.245
Aw. Okay. here's what I was thinkin'.

304
00:12:26.328 --> 00:12:27.747
[gasps] Oh. my God.

305
00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:29.373
Are we capering?

306
00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.709
[chuckles] I have so missed this.

307
00:12:31.792 --> 00:12:32.668

00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:34.044
[whispering inaudibly]

309
00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.213
[chuckling]
Of course I wanna take your money.

310
00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:38.299
I mean. endorse your product.

311
00:12:38.799 --> 00:12:40.718
Now. tell me. what does it do again?

312
00:12:41.343 --> 00:12:42.303
Right. right.

313
00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:44.096
Bottled water.

314
00:12:45.806 --> 00:12:47.183
Great. then we have a deal.

315
00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:50.019
-[cell phone clicks]
-Wow.

316
00:12:50.102 --> 00:12:52.605
Tad.
the roof is really starting to look great.

317
00:12:52.688 --> 00:12:55.566
That's because I drink
Mountain Spring bottled water.

318
00:12:55.649 --> 00:12:57.818
the only bottled water
that comes in a bag.

319
00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:02.156
Sorry. just practicing
for the endorsement deal I just made.

320
00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:05.117
Hello. underwater condo in Miami.

321
00:13:08.287 --> 00:13:11.457
Stick. if they gave Oscars
for gingerbread houses.

322
00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.250
you'd totally get one.

323
00:13:13.334 --> 00:13:15.044
I veered from the instructions.

324
00:13:15.127 --> 00:13:17.713
I'm kind of like the bad boy of Christmas.

325
00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:21.217
Ooh. an artist and a rebel.

326
00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:26.847
Stick is really looking forward to putting
the roof and the walls together

327
00:13:26.931 --> 00:13:28.933
so that he can get to the real fun part:

328
00:13:29.141 --> 00:13:31.477
adding the Christmas flair to the house.

329
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.645
That <i>is </i>the most fun.

330
00:13:33.896 --> 00:13:35.272
Everybody knows that.

331
00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:39.151
Tad's just not an artist.

332
00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:40.736
He could ruin your whole creation

333
00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.656
once he starts decorating
with his big ham hands.

334
00:13:45.324 --> 00:13:46.575
Not on my watch.

335
00:13:49.787 --> 00:13:52.790
[both] We are decorating
this house together!

336
00:13:53.123 --> 00:13:55.584
-It worked.
-Mission accomplished.

337
00:13:55.918 --> 00:13:57.211
I'll work on it for ten seconds.

338
00:13:57.294 --> 00:14:00.214
then you'll work on it for ten seconds.
and we'll alternate until it's done.

339
00:14:00.297 --> 00:14:02.216
Mission not so accomplished.

340
00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:04.426
That's not really working together.

341
00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:06.595
I'm here to make sure
he doesn't destroy my vision.

342
00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:09.390
And I'm here for some of that sweet.
sweet fun.

343
00:14:11.225 --> 00:14:14.436
How do we get them to remember
what good friends they were?

344
00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.314
Sorry. Ash. I'd love to help.
but I can't keep ignoring my followers.

345
00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:18.232
They need me.

346
00:14:18.315 --> 00:14:19.650
Streaky foundation.

347
00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.319
shiny forehead. chapped lips...

348
00:14:22.403 --> 00:14:23.779
So much suffering!

349
00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:27.575
Nine... ten... switch.

350
00:14:27.658 --> 00:14:29.702
My turn! Put down the gumdrop!

351
00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:33.455
I've been thinking.
Pitbull said he quit his show

352
00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:35.666
because he wanted to be home with family
on Christmas.

353
00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:37.626
That man had the right idea.

354
00:14:38.043 --> 00:14:41.630
Oh. <i>tío. </i>I'm so glad to hear you say that.
So. you're staying home?

355
00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:42.923
Oh. no. I'm still goin'.

356
00:14:43.465 --> 00:14:46.552
But I'm writing a song
about wanting to be home for Christmas.

357
00:14:46.635 --> 00:14:48.178
People eat that crap up.

358
00:14:48.262 --> 00:14:49.471
But. <i>tío. </i>weren't you the one

359
00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:51.599
who always wanted everyone together
for the holidays?

360
00:14:51.682 --> 00:14:53.809
Yeah. but that was
before I was the new Pitbull. baby!

361
00:14:54.518 --> 00:14:55.728
I'm Mr. Worldwide now!

362
00:14:55.811 --> 00:14:58.606
And I still got time to squeeze out
a hit song for the holidays.

363
00:14:58.689 --> 00:15:00.941
I got the verses.
but I can't find the right chorus.

364
00:15:01.025 --> 00:15:01.859
<i>Tío. </i>I don't--

365
00:15:01.942 --> 00:15:04.987

-♪<i> Well. it may not snow</i> ♪

366
00:15:05.237 --> 00:15:08.073
♪ <i>There's no sleigh bells or mistletoe </i>♪

367
00:15:08.157 --> 00:15:11.243
You just said the most important thing
is spending Christmas together--

368
00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:13.287
Oh. my God! How could I not see that?

369
00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:15.873
Spending Christmas together.

370
00:15:15.956 --> 00:15:17.041
That's the chorus.

371
00:15:17.124 --> 00:15:21.420
♪<i> Spend this Christmas together </i>♪

372
00:15:21.503 --> 00:15:24.048

Whoo!

376
00:15:28.218 --> 00:15:30.095
You cracked this wide open. Ash.
Thank you.

377
00:15:30.179 --> 00:15:31.347
I got the whole song now.

378
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:32.473
That's great. <i>tío.</i>

379
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.391
But listen. before you go to the airport.

380
00:15:34.475 --> 00:15:36.268
could you help me get Tad and Stick
to make up?

381
00:15:36.352 --> 00:15:37.853
Gimme! That's my candy cane!

382
00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:39.188
Drop it. Ham Hands.

383
00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:43.734
[crunches loudly]

384
00:15:45.819 --> 00:15:46.820
Absolutely.

385
00:15:46.904 --> 00:15:49.406
As soon as I finish picking out my outfits
for the show.

386
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:50.366
Houseminder.

387
00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:52.701
fire up my 3D clothing printer.

388
00:15:52.785 --> 00:15:55.496
I'm thinkin' leopard-print tuxedo.

389
00:15:56.872 --> 00:15:58.123
You're right. Too subtle.

390
00:16:00.084 --> 00:16:02.795
I'll be down here making
the Christmas tamales...

391
00:16:03.587 --> 00:16:05.005
by myself... [sighs]

392
00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:07.174
...in my jolly hat.

393
00:16:12.388 --> 00:16:13.347
[door opens. closes]

394
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:14.890
Ashley seems pretty upset.

395
00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:16.642
Do you think it's 'cause we're fighting?

396
00:16:16.725 --> 00:16:17.851
It's not helping.

397
00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:20.688
But nothing we can do about that.

398
00:16:22.356 --> 00:16:23.816
There's one thing we could do.

399
00:16:25.609 --> 00:16:26.819
We can pretend to make up.

400
00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.071
I don't have to pretend.

401
00:16:29.321 --> 00:16:30.698
I'm over that stupid fight.

402
00:16:30.781 --> 00:16:31.824
Get in here. buddy.

403
00:16:32.449 --> 00:16:33.784
-You mean it?
-No. [laughs]

404
00:16:34.034 --> 00:16:35.619
I'm an amazing actor.

405
00:16:37.287 --> 00:16:38.914
But that wasn't always the case.

406
00:16:39.415 --> 00:16:40.874
Mountain Spring bottled water

407
00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:43.877
brought out the best in me.
and it can do the same for you.

408
00:16:45.087 --> 00:16:46.046
Convincing.

409
00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.382
I think we can pull this off.

410
00:16:49.008 --> 00:16:50.009
Fake friends?

411
00:16:51.885 --> 00:16:53.470
[chuckles] I can't stand you.

412
00:16:58.142 --> 00:16:59.101
What's going on?

413
00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.978
We're synchronized swimming.

414
00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.772
-Well. Candy Stick and Candy Tad are.
-[chuckles]

415
00:17:04.648 --> 00:17:06.233
-Whoa.
-[Tad laughs]

416
00:17:07.484 --> 00:17:10.946
And that one there. that's Candy Ashley
on the lounge chair going.

417
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:14.033
[in high-pitched voice]
"Don't splash me. I'm a scientist."

418
00:17:14.575 --> 00:17:18.203
And Candy Brooke just dropped
her new iPhone 32 in the pool.

419
00:17:18.287 --> 00:17:20.289
-"Ermahgerd!"
-[snickers]

420
00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:23.876
You guys are getting along.

421
00:17:24.126 --> 00:17:26.128
Sure. having us work together.

422
00:17:26.587 --> 00:17:27.671
we couldn't stay mad.

423
00:17:28.547 --> 00:17:29.506
Thanks. Ashley.

424
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:31.717
Pshaw. It was all you guys.

425
00:17:32.259 --> 00:17:34.428
And I'm working
on some very important science stuff

426
00:17:34.511 --> 00:17:37.556
on my iPad down there.
so no splashin'. boys.

427
00:17:37.639 --> 00:17:39.391
[all laugh]

428
00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:40.726
That's a good one.

429
00:17:40.809 --> 00:17:42.144
-All right.
-Okay. Buh-bye.

430
00:17:45.773 --> 00:17:47.816
Stick and Tad are getting along.
[chuckles]

431
00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.735
And Rihanna finally found love.

432
00:17:49.818 --> 00:17:51.695
-Ash. we're both miracle workers!
-[chuckles]

433
00:17:51.779 --> 00:17:53.030
I know!

434
00:17:53.155 --> 00:17:54.990
Ah. this is such a relief.

435
00:17:55.157 --> 00:17:57.367
Now I know my friends
are getting along back on Earth.

436
00:17:57.451 --> 00:18:00.079
I can go on my next mission
without worrying about them.

437
00:18:00.162 --> 00:18:02.039
Wait. next mission?

438
00:18:02.831 --> 00:18:04.666
I'm going to Pluto! [chuckles]

439
00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:05.584
Pluto?

440
00:18:06.543 --> 00:18:08.378
I mean. great. W-When?

441
00:18:08.462 --> 00:18:09.588
In three weeks.

442
00:18:09.797 --> 00:18:10.714
Exciting.

443
00:18:10.798 --> 00:18:12.925
Uh... how long is this trip gonna be?

444
00:18:13.008 --> 00:18:14.218
Well. it takes seven years.

445
00:18:14.718 --> 00:18:16.553
The mission is seven years?

446
00:18:16.637 --> 00:18:18.680
No. it takes seven years to get there.

447
00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:21.308
but they freeze you.
so it feels like a half hour.

448
00:18:22.309 --> 00:18:25.562
Well. I'm gonna go back in there and revel
in Stick and Tad's renewed friendship.

449
00:18:27.523 --> 00:18:28.482
[sighs]

450
00:18:29.441 --> 00:18:30.400
[breathing shakily]

451
00:18:31.568 --> 00:18:34.071
RiRi? She's going back to space.

452
00:18:35.405 --> 00:18:36.907
Yes. you're happy. I get it.

453
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:39.243
But now it's time to talk about me.
[whines]

454
00:18:40.536 --> 00:18:41.370
You know what?

455
00:18:41.745 --> 00:18:43.539
You did a great job with the walls.

456
00:18:43.622 --> 00:18:45.332
You did a great job with the roof.

457
00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:48.627
Wait. are we not mad at each other
anymore?

458
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.840
No. I can totally stand you!

459
00:18:53.382 --> 00:18:55.259
Get in here. for real!

460
00:18:56.468 --> 00:18:57.845
Stickilish!

461
00:18:57.928 --> 00:18:58.846
-[laughs]
-[Ashley] Aw!

462
00:18:59.555 --> 00:19:01.890
Well. look at you two having fun.
like you used to.

463
00:19:01.974 --> 00:19:04.518
You don't even remember
what you were fighting about. do you?

464
00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:06.812
Oh. I remember.

465
00:19:07.688 --> 00:19:09.523
It's Tad who seems to forget things.

466
00:19:09.606 --> 00:19:12.359
Like my birthday
when you joined the NFL and became famous.

467
00:19:12.442 --> 00:19:15.529
-Do you really wanna go there?
-Ding-dong. we're already there.

468
00:19:16.071 --> 00:19:17.489
For your information.

469
00:19:17.573 --> 00:19:19.074
I always forgot your birthday.

470
00:19:19.408 --> 00:19:22.661
but Coach or Ash
or the blonde girl would remind me.

471
00:19:23.787 --> 00:19:26.623
Oh. good to know
you've always been a terrible friend.

472
00:19:26.707 --> 00:19:28.500
<i>I've </i>always been a terrible friend?

473
00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:33.380
You never called me on my birthday
or the other 367 days of the year!

474
00:19:33.463 --> 00:19:34.339
I was busy!

475
00:19:34.423 --> 00:19:35.340
So was I!

476
00:19:35.424 --> 00:19:38.051
Guys. you aren't mad
at each other anymore.

477
00:19:38.135 --> 00:19:40.637
Uh. look at what you've done
with this house. Ooh!

478
00:19:40.721 --> 00:19:42.931
Kit-Kat gutters? Oh. fan-cy!

479
00:19:44.766 --> 00:19:47.186
This is you.
with your big marshmallow head.

480
00:19:47.853 --> 00:19:50.147
[gasps] You ate me!

481
00:19:51.398 --> 00:19:52.774
These are your legs!

482
00:19:52.858 --> 00:19:54.568
Exact replicas!

483
00:19:55.527 --> 00:19:56.445
I have four legs?

484
00:19:56.528 --> 00:19:57.529
Not anymore!

485
00:19:57.654 --> 00:20:00.199
[chewing loudly] Mm!

486
00:20:00.282 --> 00:20:02.618
This is your Heisman Trophy! [inhales]

487
00:20:04.328 --> 00:20:06.246
[with full mouth]
This is your Daytime Oscar!

488
00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.290
[munches]

489
00:20:08.373 --> 00:20:12.419
Stop! I didn't come 57 million miles
to see you guys fight!

490
00:20:12.502 --> 00:20:15.589
I came from the Westside at rush hour.
We all made sacrifices.

491
00:20:18.133 --> 00:20:19.551
Brooke. help. Say something.

492
00:20:19.635 --> 00:20:22.137
-You're deserting me to go to Pluto?
-What?

493
00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:24.514
I can't believe
you're abandoning me again.

494
00:20:24.598 --> 00:20:26.516
-Wait. you're mad at me?
-[Brooke] Yes!

495
00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.685
I thought you were back
for good this time.

496
00:20:28.769 --> 00:20:30.479
I had so many plans for us.

497
00:20:30.896 --> 00:20:32.231
Mostly supportive hugging.

498
00:20:32.314 --> 00:20:35.108
but... I can't do this again.

499
00:20:35.275 --> 00:20:37.486
You were gone for six years.
and a lot happened.

500
00:20:37.569 --> 00:20:39.112
and I didn't have anyone there for me!

501
00:20:39.196 --> 00:20:40.489
What about Tad and Stick?

502
00:20:40.572 --> 00:20:42.032
They weren't there either!

503
00:20:42.115 --> 00:20:44.493
After you left.
our group kind of fell apart.

504
00:20:44.576 --> 00:20:46.787
Oh. so you're saying
I never should've achieved my dreams?

505
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:49.790
No! It's great that you went
and did your Mars thing.

506
00:20:49.873 --> 00:20:52.209
We all did our things.
but we all grew apart.

507
00:20:52.292 --> 00:20:56.421
There was nothing holding us together.
We didn't have any togetherness fun time.

508
00:20:57.256 --> 00:20:58.799
Togetherness fun time.

509
00:20:59.132 --> 00:21:00.801
Like this gingerbread house.

510
00:21:00.884 --> 00:21:02.511
That's what this was supposed to be:

511
00:21:02.594 --> 00:21:04.763
Christmas Togetherness Funtime.

512
00:21:04.846 --> 00:21:06.181
Drop it. Tad. Drop it.

513
00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:08.558
That is not gingerbread.
That is my actual key fob.

514
00:21:08.642 --> 00:21:09.601
[Tad grunts]

515
00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:11.270
I don't care!

516
00:21:11.478 --> 00:21:13.480
-I'm eating it anyway!
-[Ashley] No!

517
00:21:13.563 --> 00:21:15.941
We can have our fun time now.

518
00:21:16.483 --> 00:21:18.986
Our friendships
are like this gingerbread house:

519
00:21:19.194 --> 00:21:20.445
solid and sturdy.

520
00:21:21.196 --> 00:21:22.531
and it'll last forever.

521
00:21:30.163 --> 00:21:31.456
What? No.

522
00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:34.501
Okay. that big collapse
was not part of my metaphor at all.

523

Why can't we all be friends
like the old days?

I'm fine. And don't do that.

00:24:01.648 --> 00:24:03.442
Can we just build this gingerbread house?

Listen. we're all destined
for some really big things.

579
00:24:24.463 --> 00:24:27.340
We've got big dreams.
and we're going to get busier.

580
00:24:27.424 --> 00:24:30.886
and things are going to get crazier.
and it's gonna be awesome.

581
00:24:32.345 --> 00:24:34.556
but we have to be careful
that when we go our own ways

582
00:24:34.639 --> 00:24:36.266
that we don't grow apart.

583
00:24:37.392 --> 00:24:39.811

Well. I guess I already have more clips
than I can use.

I can take a break from editing my film.

I don't have to post an Insta Story
on Christmas Eve.

on your cheek never killed anyone.

See? Beautiful.

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:33.907

so we have to love it" kind of way.

No. it's perfect.
